<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕國民大會閉幕典禮中，大會主席吳敬恒致詞，全文如下：「各位代表先生，我們道大會開會之時，我說過是我們中華民國最可紀念，最愉快的一天，因爲開國民大會，是國父念念不忘最希望的一件事。開了國民大會，必定製出一個中華民國的圓滿憲法，將他建造的中華民國的政權，交付給中國國民，本了一個圓滿憲法，可以把中華民國在世界上永遠成功一個富强康樂之國。果然一開會，經國民政府主席把一個再三斟酌完善的憲草交到大會，這大會代表精心討論了一個多月，便製成了今大圓滿成功的一個很前進的憲法基督着三民主義，成功民有·民治·民享的共和國憲法，爲世界共和國最新的憲法。國父在天之靈，必非常愉快，國父貢獻他的　國同胞一個三民主義，請他同胞做了基礎，製出最圓滿最民主的憲法，他便達了他的熱望。他是很贊同孔子的禮讓爲國，同時亦能贊成老子的長而不宰，做了臨時總統，馬上可以讓給別人，又爲而不有，他有最好的主義，不私他的同黨，他早早寫成建國大綱，渴望開成國民大會，還政於民，因此，這大會的各位代表亦一致尊重國父的作爲，都能切合禮讓。禮讓兩個字，在禮的方面，討論不肯含糊，甚而大聲的爭論，在讓的方面，一經多數決議，馬上心平氣和的不爭，這恰恰與各國最前進的議會代表毫無二致，故能製出今天最圓滿，最民主的中化民國新憲法。現在就這第一次大會可以做今後各次大會的模範，不達個人的主張事小，做模範事大，所以又可以佩服這次代表的氣量。現在就此把這憲法送父國民政府主席、請他擇吉頒布，依法交與民選政府施行，使我中華民國永遠成爲世界上一個當强康樂之國。今天我們代表不敢吿老，得此榮幸開會之中，感謝全體國民隱爲大會後盾，故能得此成功，藉此敬祝四百五十兆同胞康寗福壽。</p>

<p>〔本報席京廿五日電〕國民黨因各省黨務人員來京出席國大，刻以大會業已閉幕，決定即召開一黨團檢討會議，定邪惡七日舉行，會期兩日。聞除檢討黨務工作外，幷將就新憲宣布後，黨務工作有所商討。</p>
<h3>憲草三讀已完成　少數代表仍反對官吏任國大代表　經蔣主席訓示後始平息</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國大第廿次會，廿五日晨十時舉行，出席代表蔣中正等一四八五人，開會時爲一三七六人，主席于右任，報吿員宣讀十九次會議紀錄後，胡適於噓噓聲中登發言台，報吿憲草修正案整理小組工作經過，胡氏詞畢，於噓噓聲中下台。上午十時廿分開始三讀工作，由于主席於會衆之掌聲中逐條　過，第廿六條對國大代表之選舉之規定，有代表提出自由職業團體選舉問題，經雷副秘書長答稱：該條第六項之「職業團體」包括自由職業團體，綜合審委會有記錄。至第廿八條因第三項官吏可否當選爲國大代表之問題，引起軒然大波，于主席甫經讀畢該項條文，倪弼即在樓廳激烈聲稱：「這一項規定，違反民主原則，不能通過，我們不能作國父的叛徒，不能作萬世的罪人。」響應者隨聲而起，攘臂高呼：「打倒食官汚吏！」「打倒官僚主義！」並紛紛要求表決，于氏置之不顯，續讀以下條文，秩序因之大亂，羣起斥責主席違法，要求將該條付諸表決。于則謂三讀只修正文字，不能作原則之更改，會衆怒吼！「依照國大組織法第十二條，制憲法定人數的規定，要是沒有出席代表四分之三的通過，不能算數。」于氏乃與洪雷兩秘長商議後，由雷宣讀議事規則第三十七·三十八兩條謂：「三　會僅得爲文字上之更正，除發現議案有互相抵觸外，不得爲修正之動議。且三讀會只議決議案，全體之可吾，不能有所更改。」一部會衆鼓掌支持，但反對者仍然不服，羣稱：「我們不要更改，只要求依法表決，制憲不是兒戲，打倒官僚主義！」一時勢成僵局。</p>
<p>至十時四十分，蔣代表中正衣綠色軍便服登發言台稱：「代表諸公，各位是代表全國人民來開會的，應遵守會議的規則，作全國人民的種範，議事規則的有關規定，已經秘書長宣續，並解釋得很明白，要依秩序進行三　工作。」蔣氏辭畢後，於大鼓掌中下台落座。但三數代表仍高呼：「請依法表決表決。」蔣乃再度登台發言：「各位代表如果再要求表決，發生了違反議事規則的結果，你們是要負責的。」一場狂瀾怒潮。始告平息。繼續讀憲工作，十時四十五分，雷副秘長代巷于主席，自第五章開始續　，除於第六十四條聲明立委選舉之規定第六款「職業團體」包括自由職業團體，綜合審委會有記錄，並將各代表所提第「七八」「一〇八」「一一一」「一四六」等條之文字，修正議案即交小組整理外，均經順和讀過‘十一時三十七分，第一七五條讀過三　，於以完畢，會衆大鼓掌達一分鐘之久。</p>
<p>旋胡適復於噓噓聲中報吿，適間小組整理結果；胡辭畢，於噓噓聲中下台後，書副秘長報吿第一七七四條第一項末「及出席代表四分之三之決議」第二「三十七」字漏印，另第七十條之「決議」字樣，經會衆質問後復維持「提議」原文，至十一時四十五分，于主席稱，「贊成中華民國憲法的請起立」，全體應聲粛然起立，水銀燈　之大明，攝影機軋軋大　全體代表於是大鼓掌並歡呼萬歲落座。少頃　副秘長宣布：「出席在場代表一四八五人全部起立贊成，憲法全文通過」。繼開始憲法施行日期之討論，以一〇五四票之絕對多數通過：「三十六年十二月廿五日爲行憲日期」雷副秘書長報告表決結果，並聲稱：主席　於數會後開會，閉幕典禮於午後舉行，其他事務秘書處有書面通知，後於十一時五十五分散會，此最後一次會議，乃告結束。</p>
<h3>民社黨發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕中國民主社會黨，廿四日發表聲明稱：本月廿四本黨接得民盟來函，關於本黨退盟事，茲發表公開聲明如次：</p>
<p>本年八月二十九日，本黨曾有一函致民盟，要求「民盟重要聲明，均須預先取得本黨同意」此函在邏輯上，並不包含本黨重要舉措，均須預先取得民盟同意，民盟乃應時代要求的一廣大的爭取民主的聯合體，本黨原爲發起人之一，自與海外民主憲政黨合併，改組爲民主社會黨後，爲表示本黨立塲，乃有八月二十九日對民盟之聲明·此次參加國大，所民完成憲法，所以期望以憲政代替訓政，較之於停滯在專政階段有進一步，本黨旣無武力，又無地盤，對於接近民主之路，豈能舍而不顧，本黨同仁受决多數人民淪於破產慘罹戰禍之呼聲所感動，自問可吿無罪。今接民盟來函謂：「碍難在本盟內繼續合作」；本黨自有主義，自有政鋼，與與其因　掛而起糾紛，自不如各自獨立之爲得計。至於爭取和平，實現民主與夫軍隊國家化之主張，同仁旣已揭　於先，自當努力貫澈於後，其與本黨同此宗旨者，一切皆可合作。至於本黨黨員參加民盟者，在此情形下，本黨當依據本黨黨章處理之。</p>

<h3>大連事件蘇並不違法　美國務院暫不干涉　惟紐約輿論界仍極端重視</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務院新聞發布員懷　今日答覆記者詢問稱：大連蘇軍當局上星期五命　船一艘於停留港內　四十八小時後離開大連，係屬合法行動，蘇聯當局並有權拒絕船上美國商人，新聞記者及攝影師各一人登岸，此二人事先均未獲得蘇聯正式許可。美國外交官報告，已證實美記者牛頓所報道之事實殊爲正確。惟於蘇軍當局曾口頭提出哀的美教　，限令美船於二十分鍾內離港，否則不負責任一節，尚未能確切證明。國務院根據所獲初步報告，現時轉取不干預態度，但此並非最後決定。該船係運送供應品及外交郵件至大連美總領事署者，曾按照慣例通知蘇聯當局，經准許停留港內四十八小時，履行正式任務，未受阻撓。惟船上所載新聞記者兩人及商人一名，未經聲請入境，該船在港期內，美總領事企圖代爲邀准，惟大連蘇聯當局謂非經莫斯科准許，無權令其進口。該船於超過原定四十八小時停泊期限後兩小時即行離開大連。按照去年八月中蘇條約規定，大連本爲一自由商港，由中國管理，惟中蘇兩國政府尚未商定接管辦法，故大連仍在蘇聯軍事管理之下。美政府希望其能早日議定移轉管理辦法，但承認此事應由兩國政府處理云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕美國海軍船一艘被蘇聯當局逐出大連一事，中國政府發言人昨日拒絕發表意見。官方人士今日稱：此舉不足爲異，因中蘇條約雖規定雙方聯合管理大連，但中國海軍船隻　無法開入大連也。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日電〕關於大連蘇軍驅逐美艦一節，紐約各報今日仍極注意，各朝報仍以第一版之顯著地位刊載。斯克利浦斯霍華德系報記者牛敦爲聯合各報所撰之遲到通訊，然迄目前止，僅有紐約時報予以評論。紐約時報以一欄半之篇幅，及四行之標題，將該消息作爲今日最重要之消息刊載，並附有地圖標題稱：蘇軍向美艦提出最後通牒，迫令離開大連，並警告於二十分鍾內離開，否則將有嚴重後果之危險。各記者與石油商人，均被禁止登岸，共和黨之前　論壇報未予批評，僅於第一版以四行標題刊稱：「蘇軍迫令美艦離開大連，美艦此次係向大連作例行之訪問，但受二十分鍾內即應離開之命令，記者二人及美商人一人，均被禁止登岸。」其他各朝報，亦以顯著地位及大字標題，刊載該消息。</p>
<h3>美記者所見　鐵幕後之大連</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕合眾社據代表世界報界之克利浦斯霍華德系報紙特派記者牛敦大連二十日電：（遲到）蘇聯顯　保持其對「東北門戶」大連之完全控制，而將繼續保持駐該地之軍隊，直至簽訂對日和約時止。此將在中蘇友好條約中關於大連一節之技術解釋之下見諸事實。據該節規定：「大連在平時並不包括在一九四五年八月十四日對旅順協定所決定之海軍基地條款之有效範圍內，而僅於對日作戰時始歸入本區之軍事監督或管制」　結即在「平時」之字句技術上，在對日和約簽訂之前，中蘇兩國仍處於對日作戰狀態之下。前　美海軍差船前往大連之美記者二人，雖遭大連蘇軍司令高柴諾夫中將摒斥於大連之外，但大連在蘇軍統治下之一般情形，仍可由中立及中國人士方面獲知一二，此一充滿憂欎及冷酷之城市。在蘇聯鐵幕之下，備受限制，市內惟一通用之貨幣爲蘇軍用票。工業陷於麻痹，飢餓與失業極爲普遍，物價奇昂，市內僅有三處建築物有抵禦東北嚴寒之暖氣設備。在戰前及太平洋戰爭期間，一向居於大連之中俄平民，日陷困苦及恐懼之深淵中，無人敢與常　蘇方監視之美人接近，人民絕少能　　蘇軍當局之逮捕與懲罰，更連論言論或新聞自由。據可靠消息：當地某一中文報紙，在其共黨發行人「　思及若干反美論調」時，即可偶然出版一次。蘇軍虐待中國及白俄居民之事，日有所聞，因抱有「大連之權必須由中國恢復」之思想而被蘇方逮捕之中國靑年學子，爲數甚多，市內到處可見類如史達林像或其他蘇聯顯赫人物畫之宣傳圖片；除此之外，尚有向當地飢餓失業之中國居民，宣傳「逐出美國人後和平及繁榮始有希望」等一類標語，但蘇軍卻充分使用美國租借物資，如艦船，飛機，汽車及其他物資。在大連所見惟一紅軍運輸艦，即爲美國所建者。大連之恐懼空氣，不僅限於中國居民，甚至蘇人亦所不免，當地蘇方官員之　一舉動，均受莫斯科控制，而蘇方軍事或外交代表，亦在恐怖生活之中，若輩必須小心翼翼，勿得踰越克里姆林宮所指示之範圍一步。觀察家僉信即因上述恐懼，遂使大連蘇軍司令高柴諾夫向美差船發出最後通牒，（限於二十分鍾內離港，否則吾人對發生之後果不負責任。）</p>

<h3>黃河堵口困難多　石料尚須五萬公方亟待趕運　堵復局視察隊竟遭共軍射擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封廿五日電〕花園口工程最困難部份，業已拋填出水，全工可望於淩汎前完成，惟工需石料尚短少五萬公方，必須於明年一月十五日以前運至工地，以現在平漢　海兩路運石情形，倘不嚴限如期如數搶運，屆時恐難運足，則淩汎一屆，橋樑發生危險，勢將前功盡棄，黃河堵復工程局，特分電各方呼籲。又黃河水利委員會趙委員長守鈺，昨赴花園口工地視察，花園口堵復局擬於最近堵口門，使水流復歸故道，同時爲免下游出險，該局副局長齊壽安，工程處長門振興，　與塔德顧問，會同駐汴中共代表趙明甫等，十六日由汴赴魯共區查勘復堤工程，卒因遭遇種種阻碍，不得已中途折返，廿二日由汴抵鄭。據朱局長光彩談：齊副局長等十六日出發，將抵荷澤臨濮集時，共軍即向彼等所乘汽車射擊百餘發，但卒冒險突過，安然進泰，十七日赴李進士堂，行經　日時，復遭共軍射擊，次日繼續向壽張縣屬之張秋鎮前進，至半途，共軍又復來襲，當時申共代表趙明甫所乘汽車落後甚遠，及至趕前時，槍聲始止。後至張秋鎮，即共軍冀魯豫邊區行署所在地，遂進行商談，共方當即提出三點（一）花園口堵口日期未經共方同意；（二）一百五十億救濟費未全數收到；（三）對救濟物資分配不滿，並謂：若因此三點而招致一切惡果，概由對方（指政府）負責。最後復以濟南以南張秋以北地方，雙方均無駐軍，無法保障安全等語相恫嚇，齊等無奈乃折返。</p>
<h3>美記者致蘇軍司令函</h3>
<p>〔聯合社大連廿日電〕（遲到）因遭拒絕，未能在大連登岸之美記者兩人，曾致函大連蘇軍司令高柴諾夫質問，信中聲稱：「吾人要求享受蘇聯新聞記者在海外美軍佔領區內享受之待遇及權利以及各國記者在中國政府統轄區內所享受之待遇及權利。吾人未敢遽信大連蘇聯官員欲隱瞞任何情形，藉以掩人耳目。大連爲遠東良港，世界各國對之均切實注意，據吾人觀察所得，知貴國仍在大連港內使用美國自由型運輸船，貴國軍隊所乘及所用者爲美國吉普車，附近蘇軍機塲中降落及起飛者亦爲美國飛機。此項配備旣由美國政府在戰時給予貴國，則吾人欲一觀貴國在戰後如何使用此項物資，自信當非無理要求。」惟高柴諾夫對此函未予置答。</p>

<h3>共軍在華北發動攻勢　保定城郊起激戰　平外圍不靖決加緊綏靖</h3>
<p>〔本報天津廿五日電〕據可靠情報，共軍決定針對國大之圓滿閉幕，在華北發動全面攻勢，各地共軍調動頻聞，行見戰火勢即燒蔓各地，有關方面表示，國軍已有週密準備，共軍此一陰謀，可能迅被遏止。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕共軍在保定西北受挫後，其勢仍不衰退，至距滿城十華里之國軍，已回撤至保西廿里，惟滿城一日在共軍手，則保定一日不安，故該城仍將爲兩軍之爭奪地。保南之于家莊，方順橋，以至望都間，復爲共軍所控制，但望都國軍猶待保定之補給，故此地區間有獲補給品之大軍通過。平保段今日已試車，情形尚稱良好，惟共軍先已調集大軍於漕河徐水間鐵路兩側，未來之通車困難仍多。涿縣西方亦到雜以民兵之共軍萬餘人。共軍之再集重兵於平漢北段，似因國軍兵力單薄之故。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定廿五日電〕共軍野戰第八旅及孟慶巴部七十，八十二兩團，廿四日晨二時分向保垣外圍十五里之南北大冉，東西石橋及距城南卅里之貢　等地猛攻，迄廿五日晨，仍在激戰。又共軍野戰第十一旅，由滿城竄漕河北姚村一帶，廿四日晨向徐水漕河頭間國軍砲擊。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕北平外圍不靖，北苑孫河岸之魯　，昨夜又被共軍千餘人攻陷，軍方已遣兵前往堵擊。西山之一片石，昨到共軍千人，平南龐各莊禮賢鎮收復后，昨今又有共軍小股在附近活動，北平警備司令部昨召集各方開會，研討辦法，決定將平郊周圍劃爲五個治安區，分由就近之駐軍負責，同時聯合北平綏靖區加緊綏靖工作。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕國軍掃蕩冀東北寗路東地區竣事，共軍四千餘人化整爲零，在國軍向海濱推進之絕對優勢扇形陣地縫隙中逃逸，一部竄往路西，久被共軍控制之冀東渤海河岸地區，已在國軍保護下。</p>
<h3>共軍屢攻終未獲逞　魯聊城形勢趨穩　軍民艱苦抗拒轉危爲安</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿四日電〕濟南外　最突出據點之聊城，邇又遭共軍猛烈圍擊，該城昔爲東昌府城，徒駭河·運河交流於此，而成該城天然護城河，國軍困守經年，共軍進攻迄未得下，本月二十日起，共軍又利用天寒水凍，集結精銳，附砲多門，向城猛撲達三晝夜，先後裏脅民眾。廣置雲梯，踏水爬城亦十餘次。城內軍民在王金祥專員率領下，奮勇抗拒，城吿無恙，至廿三日晚，共軍仍將砲火集中東門，不斷轟擊，至十時被擊燬丈餘，缺口達二處，共軍乃蜂擁前進，國軍正以肉彈奮勇抗　，而城內一片號泣求援聲，亦正隨城之危急而有增無已中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿五日電〕圍攻聊城共軍，昨晚起，在迫擊砲三，野砲一，掩護下，續向城垣猛撲，城內數萬軍民在澈底合作下，冒彈雨將東門缺口修復，並一鼓將共軍擊退，二十五日竟日大雪，情勢已稍穩定。</p>
<h3>宿遷外圍　共軍敗退　國軍收復窰灣</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿五日電〕共軍五萬餘人，連日分路猛犯宿遷外圍及皂河窰灣附近地區，但廿四日已開始退卻。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿五日電〕（一）窰灣收復已證實，國軍正肅淸隴海以南邳宿睢境內之殘餘共軍。聞灌雲縣境內共軍，尚有三團之眾，惟戰志已喪失。（二）阜寗共軍因內閧甚烈，無力作戰，已有撤退模樣，阜寗在陽曆年內有重見天日可能。</p>

<h3>制憲大業的完成</h3>
<p>專爲制定中華民國憲法而召開的國民大會，業於昨日將憲法草案全部通過，宣告閉幕，此一隆重的制憲大業，於以完成。這在我國民族歷史上是空前的盛舉。如今中華民國憲法旣經制定，關於憲法的實施，亦已明定辦法，且國民大會在閉幕以前，確定憲法施行日期爲明年十二月二十五日，是則憲政開始有期，實在是慰一般人民喁喁之朝。對於這四十餘天來，國民大會各出席代表的　勞，全國人民無不深爲感奮。茲當國民大會閉幕，中華民國憲法制定之際，談向各代表表示中國人民一般的感謝。</p>
<p>這次憲法的制定是中國人民公意的表現。國民大會代表來自全國社會各階層，實爲全國民意最好的橫斷面。竭一千四百餘代表的　力，以四十一日的時間所通過的憲法，其間又曾有熱烈的辯論，再　的　重。故此次所通過的憲法，實是竭盡智慮爲一部可行的國家大法。這　　所規定的政　及其它的條款，容納了各方面的意見，尤能表示中正協和的精神，爲此次制憲的國民大會　下了永恒的光輝。　一國的憲法，爲國家的根本大法，當其制定，　　　　各方意見而爲各方所公　：必其能爲各方所公　，然後始能爲國家的大法。過去美國聯邦憲法的制定是如此。就是此次戰後法國的制憲，情形亦復相同。我國此次憲法的制定，繼美法兩先進民主國之成規，樹立了我國民主政治的基礎，此　爲中國政治上一個劃期的轉折點。</p>
<p>講劃憲法，憲法本身不僅是若干條文，而是一種活的·具有生命的創造物·憲法的制定僅能說是憲法的產生，像剛誕生的嬰兒一樣，它還得發育以至於長成。嬰兒的誕生是苦痛的，苦痛中產生了生命，但比誕生更艱辛的還有此後的養育使其達到成年。如今憲法旣已誕生，我們此後更應加意撫育這從痛苦中產生出來的嬰兒。我國憲法的先生，適在耶穌聖誕這一節日，也實在似乎不僅是一種偶然的巧合，耶穌是人類的救主，這部從痛苦中所產生出來的中國憲法，至少也應同樣能救我們的中國。耶穌聖誕這一天，又是我們的民族復興節，此次國民大會所制定的中華民國憲法適於此日完成，是誠足爲中國民族的復興的象徴。願全國人民愛護我們的憲法，使國家從此長治久安！</p>
<h3>黃金風潮</h3>
<p>以中央銀行連日拋售黃金的結果，金價終於慘跌了。兩日之間，從四百萬元的　關，跌到三百二十萬元，相差達八十萬元左右，其他美　·股票·香煙·紗布·綢緞等等，因此連帶下跌。有幾家小規模的銀樓·錢莊·銀行·以措手不及，甚至發生動搖，　息升到兩角以外，市塲上談虎色變，莫不深懷　懼。從這一點，我們對於下列　事可得到一個證明。</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行對於黃金市價，確有左右的能力。</p>
<p>（二）金價的漲落，確與物價有關，對於具有投機性的物品，其刺激尤烈。</p>
<p>（三）確有許多金融業·證券業·及普通商家，在經營着投機生意。</p>
<p>（四）有一部份小規模的金融業，其基礎殊欠穩固。</p>
<p>（五）銀根抽緊，便影響到拆息。</p>
<p>（六）銀根的抽緊或放寬，確操在中央銀行之手。</p>
<p>因爲有上述這一連串事實，互相關聯，所以聯想到以下的三件事。</p>
<p>金價的上落，其影響旣如是廣泛，而中央銀行又確具有控制的能力，則該行對於金價，應否隨時維持相當的水準？換句話說：讓牠飛漲到相當高的程度，然後用大壓力，把牠硬　下來，這方法是否賢明？假如早一點大量拋售，使牠抬不到四百萬元的高度，因此金融與物價的波動範圍，可以縮小一些，是不是於一般工商業，和一般民眾有利？這幾個問題，似乎值得研究。此其一。</p>
<p>中央銀行對於銀根及利率，顯然具有無上的威權。僅僅在黃金政策上小試其技，已夠使整個市塲，風翻浪湧，莫由自主。那麽，一般所痛心疾首的高利貸和周轉困難問題，在中央銀行似不難把握方針，予以適當的解決。就是說：現在工商業所苦心焦慮的問題，並不是沒有辦法。其唯一要點，只在財政和金融當局的見解究竟如何耳。此其二。</p>
<p>杜絕投機，嚴禁操縱等等，雖然過去已有不少的文吿。但從過去這幾日的市面看來，顯然還有好許多商家和金融家，依舊沉浸其中，樂而忘返。以後應當如何切實控制，導入正軌。尤其是從事金融業務的人，如何使他們懲前毖後，　然知返，以免牽動整個的市面，這實在是值得注意的問題。此其三。</p>
<p>陽歷年關，轉眼即至，陰歷年關又不在遠。在這工商業的危機十分嚴重的時候，大家兢兢業業，穩紮穩打，還恐意外風波，莫能倖免。照這幾日的情形看來，似乎大夢方酣，人事上·管理上·運用上·未臻健全的地方太多了。希望大家特別注意一下才　。</p>

<h3>蚌埠冬訊</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　錢夢超</p>
<p>寒流到了蚌埠，時令正値仲冬，淮隄蚌山間己是枯樹校椏，黃葉滿地。當兵燹水災之後，哀鴻載道，嗷嗷待哺，靖區皖東難民急振中隊部已宣吿成立，但是何時施放振濟物品，此時尙不可知，這裏數萬災黎望眼欲穿的蚌埠市救濟院，籌募基金委員會成立已久，募得的基金，據說已有四五千萬元，但救濟院何時正式成立，部尙未可知。</p>
<p>加緊冬防　槍決兩匪示儆</p>
<p>貧民在天寒呌苦的期間，正是宵小乘機活動的時候，這裏綏蜻當局鑒於蚌市人烟稠密父通繁複，五方雜處，良莠不齊，值此冬防時期，治安在在堪處，曾規定維護治安辦法四項，通飭遵行，四項辦法是：（一）加強盤查哨的檢查工作，以防奸究混入市塲，妨礙治安。（二）飭軍憲警聯合巡查隊切實執行命令，斜正服裝不整的軍人及取締散兵游勇。（三）每日夜派隊分段檢查商行旅館，妓院，及取締軍人狎妓，並堵絕不良份子匿跡其間。（四）調查本市居民戶籍移動，及淸查戶口，以防奸究潛伏。軍警機關雖是嚴厲執行，可是搶劫的案子，仍是迭出議起，本月六日晚，西市區黃山保居民陳宜之家，被匪徒十餘人洗劫一空，復將陳父兆惠用刀砍死，並將九歲男孩陳家玉帶去，六七兩日下午發生騙劫銀樓金器案，被搶的是二馬路鬧市合記老鳳祥，元記老鳳祥和老天寳三家，匪人白查行劫膽大已極，第八區綏靖司令部特於九日午刻，綁出夏間結夥行劫的兩名軍人，在蚌市南崗外執行槍決，一是黃斌，廣西陽朔人，一是謝森橋，廣西桂林人，過去都在供應局充當士兵，爲在蚱壽道上搶劫商店，同時伏法，當局頗有殺一儆百，以寒匪膽的意思</p>
<p>崩潰堪虞　市場倒風甚熾</p>
<p>天災人禍，交相迭乘，反映出來的是伏莽不蜻，治安堪憂，不景氣的洪流，似秋間黃汛般的向蚱市湧進，時値冬令，市塲所表現的是冷淡與孤寂，現在幾乎整個籠罩着崩潰的陰影，這裏的工商業，已走近崩潰的邊緣，甚至有的竟陷入崩潰的深洲，商店粉紛倒閉，可作爲蚌市不景氣的一種具體表徵。</p>
<p>按着慣例，銀根吃緊的現象，總發生在舊曆年邊，而這寒冬的開始，正是大家添購衣着，　積食品準備過冬的季節，可是大小商店雖是竭力招徠僱着西樂隊，大吹大擂，貼着大减價，大拍賣，剔莊六折，空前犧牲的市招，以吸引顧客，但顧問者終寥寥無幾，足徵市民購買力之减低，金融之極度呆滯。</p>
<p>倒風隨着寒風，幾乎襲擊整個的蚌埠市塲，它像旋風似的在各業中兜圈子，商店和各種的行號，因受不景氣影響，而被迫歇業或宣吿淸理的，幾乎日有所聞，根據市商會的調查，九月份倒閉三十三家，十月份倒閉十七家，十一月份又是三十二家，本月內相繼歇業的，又有二馬路的大新百貨公司和正平街的義記振業製革廠，年關在邇‘恐仍將有迫不得巳的行號，準備閉歇。</p>
<p>地下錢莊　暗中極形活躍</p>
<p>在這各業倒風熾烈的時候，祇有銀錢業尙能欣欣向榮，貼現生意特別地好，戰前本市銀錢業共有二十餘家，現在的銀行有中央，中國，交通，農民，上海，安徽，蚌埠市七家，銀號有裕民，信昌祥一家，錢莊有福誠，安利等九家。此外尙有秘密營業的地下錢莊，因爲客觀環境的需要，茁茂如雨後春笋，極形活躍，從事高利貼現或賒貸經營，實是蚌市高利貸的魔手。據中央銀行蚌埠分行經理余浩如吿訴記者，謂高利貸之形成，實緣於市面不景氣而產生，如說是高利貸造成市面不景氣，母寗說是高利貸因市場需要而興起，商人明知飲鴆止渴，原爲非計，其所以甘之如飴者，贊有其不得已之苦衷。地下鐵莊這兜放高利貸款，無疑是一種違法行爲，惟經營此等業務的，大多行動詭密，中央銀行固有取締和　止之權，然實不易查獲云。（十六日）</p>

<h3>大霧中空前慘禍　三客機同夜失事　渝來中國公司兩機中一架在龍華墮毀　機師搭客廿九人幾全部罹難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市氣假異常惡劣，龍華機塲上空雨濃霧，障蔽地面，致昨日傍晚中國航空公司自渝來滬客機兩架，因無法降洛，分別墮毀機塲上及浦東華地，傷亡慘重，另有中央航空公司自京來滬客機一架，則設法在江灣機塲附近降落，情形尙佳。</p>
<p>昨晨九時許，重慶方面中國航空公司客機兩架起　來滬。一架係C-47型第一四〇號機，由美籍機師格林華特（Greenwood），副機師劉君（L．S．Liu）無綫電員金君（K．King）等航駛，自渝珊瑚壩戰場起飛。一架係C-46型第一一五號客機，由美籍機師　勞斯（Prdus），副飛機師譚君（H．C．Tan），無電員王君（S．T．wang）航駛，由渝白市　起飛。</p>
<p>午後一時左右，再機先後過漢口停　，逐又續飛來滬。過南京時，因京市氣候亦惡劣異常，因此並未降落，逕行直飛上海。</p>
<p>第一四〇號機首先於五時左右飛抵滬市上空，因濃霧瀰沒，無法降落。雖曾迭次與機塲上無綫電指揮塔聯絡，報吿不能判明跑道方向等情，終無着陸之法。是以第一四〇號機翱翔上空計有二一一一小時。至七時五十五分，該機適在機塲上空，汽油吿罄，遂即失去飛翔能力，機首突向下傾，即向地面直衝。初聞機聲憂戛，經聞尖銳破耳之聲劃破夜空，向地面衝來，轉瞬間，碰然一聲，該機即墮毀機塲上，當時曾略起火　是時機場上人員，正在急籌援救辦法，並早經召到消防處消防車二輛，救護車二輛，先已到場等候。此時即趕往墮毀處急救。</p>
<p>本報記者於該機失事後十分鐘內即已獲得消息，立刻趕往龍華機場勘查。見該機墮毀於南北方向大跑道旁側約十餘碼處，南距南黃浦江僅二三百碼。該客機尾部朝西北，從機腹中部機門五呎以上以至機首一段，業已整個粉碎。機翼飛　於十餘碼處，與機體分離。機尾翹起，亦已殘破，想見衝擊之猛烈。在此失事地點附近十餘間門面之範圍內，盡係從機中拋出之死亡男女旅客及殘破衣物等件。記者藉電筒徵光，會目睹離機門五呎之地上，有一二十餘歲女屍，服飾麗都，　屈橫倒於　泥中。</p>
<p>後經查明該機乘客共二十六人。當塲跌斃者十三人。餘十三人（男九，女四）經急送中山醫院，其中六名死於車上。實際由醫院急治者僅七人。記者曾轉赴醫院探問，據醫師吿記者稱：經動手術後，確悉二名已入　留狀態，四名生死未卜，僅一名大致尙可有生存之望。上述諸人中有四名係女性，一死一危，二名生死未卜。此項死傷旅客名單，迄屬稿時，公司方面猶在向渝探詢，未能明悉。據記者探視此唯一受侮較輕者，見其面部極度腫傷，紥有紗布，口中　語喃喃，所言多未足　信。</p>
<p>又悉正機師顯　破裂而死，副機師則腸腹洞穿無救．僅無錢雷負金君送於醫院。</p>
<p>第二客機接踵墮毀</p>
<p>當第一四〇號機出事時，第一一五號仍廻翔天際，亦正無法降落記者馳車抵機場大門，曾見此機陡然自南而北，劃過天空，距地不過二百餘呎。此時爲九時十分許，自此以後，機塲方面即不復聞得其音訊。　中國航空公司人員後得報吿，知該一一五號機亦已於九時卅分墮毀浦東方面。乃即派員四出尋覓，美海軍及水上警察分局亦派船隻協助搜索。唯迄午夜猶未能覓得其殘骸。</p>
<p>據記者向南黃浦江岸旁守衛兵及上海水泥廠司閽探明，彼輩會見此機自東北低飛衝向西南，後曾聞隆然一響，但未見有火起，大政方位在浦東泰山水泥廠以南的五六里處。</p>
<p>中央公司機亦被迫</p>
<p>至中央航空公司之客機一架，由指揮塔警吿後，飛往江灣機塲，卒在蘊藻浜附近，被迫降落。當時曾有民房一間被壓毀，死屋中婦人一名，傷三人。傷者姓名爲張陸氏，四十六歲，張玉寳，十一歲（女），張新德，十四歲（女），俱係頭部受重傷死者係張陸氏之媳。所有傷者後經送公濟醫院救治中。</p>

<h3>美輪拉壞水底電纜　浦東電力暫停供給</h3>

<h3>駐滬美兩大巡洋艦　招待孤苦兒童　擯棄樂園門外的難童　享受了半日天堂生活</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕聖誕節過了。　儘管聖誕大菜賣十萬元一客，舞廳除茶資漲到三萬元一杯外，另外再敲你一票入塲券的竹槓。但是娛樂塲所還是家家客滿。多少的天之驕子，曾經在道快樂的季節裏，嚼火鷄，呷香檳酒，盡興享受，狂歡達旦！</p>
<p>同樣是耶誕前夕，同樣是在上海，也許就在舞廳的門前，咖啡館的牆脚下，那些被遺忘了的可憐蟲，在忍受飢寒的交煎，正用着他們最後的一口氣，在生命綫上掙扎！</p>
<p>自然，道　暖房中的天之驕子是不層知道的，誰願意在這佳節良辰，讓那些破破爛爛的呌化來煞風量呢？</p>
<p>殷勤招待共度佳工</p>
<p>感謝中國友人的溫情，他們在過度的喜悅中，尙不忘記生活在苦難中的中國孩童，泊於黃浦江邊的兩大巡洋艦，洛杉磯號與哈林娜號，特在聖誕節，招待本市漕河涇難民難童收容所中的苦兒二百人及俄藉難童數十人，共度佳節。使那羣曾經流浪街頭，被擯棄於樂園門外的難童，享受了半日天堂的生活。</p>
<p>美國海軍的招待，非常週到。中午十二時正，二艘巨型登陸艇已經停候在灘邊。他們把孩子一個個扶入艇裏，接上巡洋艦，先餐以慧的西菜，然後領着他們到處參觀，在大　中放映電影，最後還喬裝了聖誕老人分送大批禮品……</p>
<p>慧西菜糖果禮品</p>
<p>這一天，在於那羣難童是不平凡的，登陸艇，巡洋艦，途白塔的土司，SW咖啡，上好西菜，華脫狄斯耐的卡通電影，穿大紅袍子的聖誕老公公，　統裏的糖果和玩具，……一切都是空前的，一切都將永速地成爲平生的奇　！</p>
<p>當孩子們用顫抖的手，拿起從未接觸過的刀又，取食豐美的西</p>
<p>，我不知道他們作何意想？難民難童收容所的所長周祖望吿訴我，他正惦念着那些留在所中的難童在做些什麼？原來這二百個孩子是抽籤抽中的幸運兒。還有一千多個難童留在所裏吃「行　」配給的黑麵粉過聖誕節。同時，他還在想，那些在牧容所以　的成千成萬露宿街道，喝西北風過日子的乞丐如何過過聖誕節？</p>
<p>聖誕老人何日再來</p>
<p>洛杉磯艦長伏奇里，和哈林娜艦長白魯，對於這羣難童的懂禮貌，守秩序，非常感動，除了殷勤招待之後，還親自登甲板揮手歡送。</p>
<p>傍晚四時，在迷濛的細雨中，孩子們辭別巨型巡洋艦。當登　艇載着他們橫渡黃浦江時，我相信每一個滿載而歸的孩子都要問，「聖誕老人幾時再來」？　雅可以給他們一個確切的回答呢？</p>

<h3>聖誕節花絮　日歷畫片生意佳　舞場茶資加數倍</h3>
<p>聖誕節高潮已過，有錢的人　着爲籌備過新年忙，再過半個月又將爲過舊歷新年忙，忙來忙去，爲的是過年過節，忙着過窮日子的人，正愁沒有下鍋米，那還管它是年是節。</p>
<p>文化街上，應時貨品，　日曆，賀年片和畫片生意最佳，美國新到賀年片，精緻美觀，起碼價是一千元，最高到三千元，購者踴躍。畫片生意，以鄰近上海之批發戶購者最多。畫片中仍多以封神榜，西遊記，劉關張拜弟兄爲背景，綴新式的有原子彈戰爭圖。美女出浴圖，允能引人，爲之止步。</p>
<p>昨日各馬路要口，有人散發天安堂慶祝聖誕籌備會印的傳單，上爲：「今日的人心，充滿着黃金慾。領袖慾，鼓動着　手，掀風起浪，運用着腦筋，翻雲覆雨，口唱的是和平，計劃的是戰爭。飽的飽，餓的餓，這樣不均的局面，我們基督徒，有一個報吿：今天是</p>
<p>耶穌聖誕，來信仰這位代人贖罪，建立天國的救世主，得以革除私慾，新生愛心，進入永生，否則同歸於盡，不信此說，試想上文，規在惟一轉機，來信耶穌，因他是愛，今人所缺的是愛。」</p>
<p>兩日來各舞塲茶資加高五六倍不止，看樣子不過陰歷年不會恢復原價。以漲價來紀念年節，最足表示海上的繁華。</p>

<h3>探監記　五百餘名漢奸　最近生活狀況</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在傳說限期檢舉漢奸聲中，讓我們來看看現　押在上海監獄已決未決五百餘各漢奸的生活狀况：</p>
<p>衣：按照監獄規定，無論已決犯和未決犯，都需一律穿着囚衣。但因爲勝利後監獄驟然「光臨」這許多「貴客」，囚衣不够分配，未決犯遂特准穿家常衣服。所以上法庭受審時，仍多西裝革履，長袍裝束，每星期家　並可送換衣服。</p>
<p>食：每人每日囚糧二十兩米，分作兩餐，因爲人多，所以分批輸琉進食，上午八點到十一點，下午兩點到四點，白飯上加有蔬菜，獄中稱爲「蓋交飯」，但一般「富奸」，自有家屬每星期送來的罐頭食品和新鮮水菓代替「蓋交飯」，亦就　之不顧了。</p>
<p>住：忠監是一幢五層的水泥建築，共有監房三百七十四間，因爲屋多人少，所以有的一人一間，有的兩人合住，最多每間不超過三人。除老弱者外，一概不准架設床舖，那些過去睡慣「席夢思」沙發床的「顯宦」們，如今亦祇得　　席地而臥的滋味了。</p>
<p>行：囚居在鐵柵小室裏的人犯，對於每天能跨出囚房走動走動，認爲是無上享受，稱之爲「解放」。獄中規定上午七時開封，讓他們在走廊或天井內散散步，或和患難朋友聊聊天，待到十一時收封，重復被鎖入囚房。這樣到下午一點半開封，四時再收封。</p>
<p>忠監裏的「寓公」，便在道樣的生活方式下，消磨着一天天的光陰。外來的書報不准閱讀，但有許多消息，他們亦都知道。待等確定判決，便移住孝監，道時必須換穿囚衣，每兩星期可接見家屬一次，亦必須作工。好在監獄內的工塲設備很好，有印刷，製罐，成衣等等，依照工作成績、，每月亦可有點收入。到這時「部長」。「省長」，販夫走卒，特任官或盜賊，大家混在一起，亦不分什麼「階級」了。</p>
<p>監獄裏的醫院設備很好，患精神病的人，特闢有橡皮室。感化院則備有樂器，以供陶冶心情。忠監「寓公」不乏文人雅士，所以過去曾有書畫俱樂部的組織，閒來賦詩作畫，互相揣摩。聞蘭亭蔡培等閑時念佛講經，袁履登沈嗣良等則在每星期日會同基督徒做禮拜，鐵窗歲月，囹圄生活，這是在表示懺侮，還是冀求精神上的解脫？</p>
<h3>沈嗣良案傅訊四證人　名名有利　約大學生擁集高院旁聽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前聖約翰大學校長沈嗣良，被控充任僞職，經高檢處以漢奸嫌疑罪起訴一案，曾於上月十五日初審，昨日下午在高院刑二庭傳訊倪葆春·楊寬麟·黃嘉德·張素民四證人，未傳訊被吿，昨日聖約翰大學敎授同學到庭旁聽者甚衆，外籍敎授亦到數人，詢問歷一時餘始畢，茲將證人陳述各點分誌於后：</p>
<p>倪葆春</p>
<p>聖約翰大學敎授期，渠與沈嗣良均兼任醫師委員會委員，該會任務爲將醫師及醫藥器材，設法運送後方，以供開關滇緬路時之用，幷與軍事委員會西南運　處在香港訂有合同，共送至後方二十多個醫生，一百多個助手，渠離開上海赴昆明後，該會總幹事即由沈嗣良繼任，直至太平洋戰事發生，交通斷絕而後止，幷呈上該會與西南連輸處簽訂合同原本一件。</p>
<p>楊寬麟</p>
<p>該校土木工程學院院長，渠稱：被告之出任偽職，係完全敷衍敵僞，其目的純粹維持學校，因日人對於聖約翰校產，　思沒收，故不得不虛與委蛇，對於庭上詢問該校聘任日　顧問坂本義孝，田川大吉兩人一事，渠稱：幷非顧問，係兩日籍教授，擔任經濟及歷史課程，對於學校行政從不過問。</p>
<p>黃嘉德</p>
<p>該校文理學院副院長，渠稱：沈嗣良之任聖約翰大學校長，係由於該校校黃會之委派，被吿各種僞職，多數未經同意，即由敵僞報紙發表，因敵　報紙，對於新聞報道方面，常有不確實之消息發表，并以渠個人爲例，此次大公報發表飛機在長興失事，渠亦殘命，實際幷無其事，且聖約翰大學在當時敵僞心目中，以爲歷史悠久，故凡遏有敎育文化團體，均强派一份，不管同意與吾，在當時敵僞壓力下，除聖約翰關門外，實無其他方法拒絕，至於敵　管理委員，乃爲保管聖約翰大學校產，其他各種僞職，除偽上海市諮詢委員外，均稱不甚淸楚。另傳一在押之</p>
<p>張素民</p>
<p>作證，張係偽財政部　務署長，兼偽　　產業管理事務處處長，渠稱：該處全係由國人組織而成，由日人將所謂敵僞產業撥交該處分配，渠因沈嗣良原係該校校長，即交渠保管，目的即在保護英美敎會產業，沈嗣良在該處幷無任何名義，接收時亦未舉行儀式。末由</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕償還戰前存款涉訟第一件，陳季琳控吿四行儲蓄會案，經地院判決依一千倍增加給付，四行儲蓄會不服向高院上訴，昨日開庭，上訴人代理律師辯論二點：（一）法幣貶値確爲專實，即去年至今年一年中物價已漲數百倍，如因法幣貶値而必欲增加給付，則社會金融將不堪設想。（二）銀行地產升値，未淸算前不能知其確否獲得實益，妄自估價，徒作猜測，法律上毫無根據。庭上以該案案情已明，宣吿辯論終結，定期宣判。</p>
<h3>市民建議參議會　請改善因犯待遇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會連日收受市民建議書，已達七十餘件，參議員提案亦有十餘件，今日收到函件中有市民建議改善囚犯待遇，及參議會周祥生陳公達瞿鉞提案交保人犯應儘量以殷實舖保爲原則，不得悉交現金担保，以免貧窮人犯，難蒙實惠，茲將市民建議案內容，摘錄如下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕社會局趙班斧處長接見本報記者，答覆各項有關年賞之問題，綜合要點如下：（一）本市六大公用事業年賞，已決定爲一個月，勞力接受無問題。（二）絲　業之年賞問題，　涉廠家四十，工人一萬以上。勞方最初要求年賞兩月，資方根本不願考慮，經勞工處努力後，勞方讓步至二十八日，資方讓步至六日。因絲綱業各廠之盈　情形不同，趙氏建議有盈餘者裱助虧損者，使能負担最低限度之合理年賞。此事正繼續綢處中。（三）有盈餘之事業，如自願發一月以上之年賞，而無勞資糾紛時，社會局可以不管。趙氏認爲各業盈虧情形迥不相同，援例要求爲不合理之事，對於雙俸之辦法，認爲頗合理。</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）輕信讒言</p>
<p>美夢樁問　鄱人十八歲時，因不耐繼母苛待，離家自立。後因懷家心切，重入庭闈，不意繼母故態復萌，不能安居，故於最近再度出走，家父生性懦弱，輕信婦言，申稱將登報脫離父子關係，鄙人外出，事前雖未商得家長同意，但事後曾致函家長，以表歉意，申述理由，毫未謗誹家署，況出走時所帶均係私人物件，並未將家中任何一物携出。請問是項聲明是否有效？慼如何對付？</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕父子關係係屬直系血統，依法不得脫離。如有登報脫離父子關係者，依法當然無效。</p>
<p>（二）分析遺產</p>

<h3>金融市場波濤險惡　新設行莊首富其衝</h3>
<p>央行當局發表感想</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來金融市塲，疊起彼動，其中尤以黃金一項，暴漲特甚。惟　日經央行一再拋售鎭！市價終吿不支下瀉，昨日再度劇跌。一般投機取巧份子，首受打擊。影響所及，若干新設之銀行錢莊，頭寸遂驟然吿緊。其中尤以放帳較　，或往來客戶較　者，驟經打撃，即發生不　現象。昨日傳聞中者共達六家之多，事後紛謀彌補，或另加改組。記者爲特趨訪央行稽核處副處長高岳生氏，叩以央行當局，對此事之觀感。　談：本市金融業之業務經營，向由財政部錢幣司直接　導。央行當局，對金融業中若千行莊，發生不穩現象，當亦備極關注。惟查若千新　行莊，大多係內地分號。蓋財部條例，本有規定，若內地行莊，設立已逾四年，且業務經營穩健者，得在他處設立分號。現查內地行莊，符合該條例之規定者，數不在少。故最近滬市乃有大批新行莊出現。查該批行莊，常多資金不甚充足。往往一筆開辦費，已將　所有資金，而猶須負債若干，　該批行莊，又多外行人氏經營者。對銀行業務經營，全乏統盤籌劃。再以本市行莊，平素爲調劑本身頭寸盈虛，常賴同業拆放。一且金融市塲波動，各行莊無不收縮頭寸，以維自身實力。平日依賴同業拆放之行莊，驟然失所憑藉，難免不發生動搖現象。又查目前行莊存款，十九皆屬活期存款，極富於神經質及游離性。市塲波動時，該項存款即成游資，流入市塲　　黃余美鈔。故資歷較淺之行莊，通常依該項活期存款爲頭寸之調撥者，至此即易遭擱淺。最　著之例證，即過去各行　　在票據交換所頭寸偶有不足，而須待彌補者，每日不過數千萬元。茲者差額達二三億元者，已數見不鮮。故渠甚望金融界經過此番波動後，更應以穩健方策，爲今後經營業務之職志云。</p>
<p>又訊，際此年關迫近之時，復遭遇黃金風潮，一般投機者流，推波助瀾，獲暴利者固有，但以把舵失穩，被轉進漩渦而傾覆者，亦復不少，如成大銀號停止交換後昨日復有順利銀號宜吿淸理，此外尙有五家新興銀行以頭寸週轉不靈，昨日頓呈緊張現象，市塲對以上各銀行擱淺之情形，更屬傳說紛紜，因此各　重之行莊，對於頭寸調度，均抱審愼態度，兼之中央銀行連日來大量拋售黃金，吸收頭寸，近千億元，市面銀根頓吿緊縮，暗息已提高爲二角，但仍難借得現款，故一般預料在銀根奇緊之情形下，黃金價格勢難看好，其他物價亦將逐漸回平云。</p>
<h3>拆息高至三角以上　金鈔市價繼續慘跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨受金融界普　　　，繼續慘跌，晨開三四〇萬有求，開後曾微升至三四三萬，不久銀錢　之缺單者紛來求售，跌風又起，而確三四〇萬關，十時後央行以三三六萬之價，配給四十條，此後人心更爲恐慌，不穩消息頻傳，再破呂一三三〇萬大關，某銀行倒閉之訊，賣風更如火上加油，漫無止境，午刻更跌至三一五萬以下，而後稍穩，午後現交曾有削價求現者，見三〇八萬低價，隔日交割開出自三一七，逐步升至三二九萬，最後仍被壓低至三二〇萬左右，結果較前收再跌二十三萬，飾金卅四萬五，銀元亦降，暗拆普通在二角光景，當日頭寸者，竟扳高至三角以上。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦被動帶小美鈔晨開六七〇〇元又售，即隨金價回落，午刻降低至六二〇〇元以下，午後稍吿平穩，在六二〇〇元至六四〇〇之間徘徊，結果較前收又跌四〇〇元，港票　爲呆滯，自一三五〇元起盤低至一二五元以下，結果亦跌一二〇元，港匯因港市耶誕休似，經營者僅肯以一三〇〇元之供給，印匯一四八〇元，英匯二〇八〇〇元，均屬賣價，並無成交做開。</p>
<h3>公債平疲</h3>
<p>公債昨尙　支持，雜牌稍痰，統丙晨開一三九〇元，三六〇室來售，曾低至一三三〇元，後以五五二室有補，乃回高至一四六〇元，而後轉　，結果較前收計甲乙丙各升三十元，統丁跌五十元，統戊則跌一〇〇元，成交的三百萬元。</p>
<h3>證券號五家　非法交易　經查出勒令停業</h3>
<p>社會局對於證交塲外不法交易，在積極取締中，茲悉：社局據證交監理官函謂，本市　來，萃豐，炳記，一二泰，新華，泰豐等證券號，及　誠紗號，非法塲外交易，請　取締，當即派員會同警察局前往調查，並檢查脹册及交易情形，經查出泰豐，萃　，炳記，三泰，新華等號，確有非法交易行爲，昨已勒令各該號停業，同時通知公用局，拆除該號等電話，並囑各證券號至社會局具結，以後不再非法交易，至寳誠紗號，經查明並無不法交易情形，僅由社局　其具　云？</p>
<h3>紗價續跌</h3>
<p>昨日紗市因黃金疾降，客幫吸胃薄弱，業中人供求踴躍，加以製品工廠之配給紗貶價求售，是以二十支又跌五六萬，雙股綫問津乏人，更見疲滯，竟跌七八萬云。</p>
<p>二期南運月杪結束</p>
<p>據悉：第二期南　紗布，自本月份開始辦理登記，截至廿四日上午止核准　請廠商，的有四十家左右，計棉紗三千八百五十七件，布四萬九千四百八十八疋，至本期紡管會批准南運紗布總額，棉紗爲五千八百另一件，棉布爲十二萬五千四百九十二疋，聞本期各廠商聲請南運紗布，該會准於本月杪結束，如屆期本期批准南運紗布總額尙有餘額時，當　併於第三期辦理。</p>
<p>四期配紗價格不變</p>
<p>第四期第四次配給復制品業棉紗價格，紡織廠有調整之意，唯紡管會並未經審定，是以配價仍須維持舊價，本得變更。</p>
<p>廿支雙股恢復掛牌</p>
<p>中國紡織建設公司，以廿支雙支杪綫爲　帆業主要原料，自聯合配紗以來，該項紗綫，均未開配，茲以恢復掛脾，特予列入，其價格依照廿支單紗增加百分之十二·五，每件一九六萬五千元，並自本月二十日起開始，業已通知複製品棉紗配銷會轉知各同業。</p>
<h3>人造絲　第四次配給　申請者寥寥</h3>
<p>染織業同業公會前以各同業需要人造絲摻夾　繼成品，經向中信局申請核配，經該局核准後，受配各戶，每戶發給申請卡一紙，按月配發四次，每次繳款申請手續，均由該會轉接辦理，茲悉：本月第四次業定於廿七日開售，各同業繳款日期，統限於廿六日巾午截止，如　期不繳者，作爲自願放棄論，現各同業登記卡巳送到會者，計有新華公等十九家，未送到者，尙有四六家，該會巳通知各同業知照，又據該公司負責人稱：年關將屆，同業資金週轉不靈，故未送者，恐多係無力繳款。</p>
<h3>台糖疾退</h3>
<p>昨臺糖因開始可以提貨，現貨頓增，價乃急遽下降，公會劃盤中砂白現貨降至十三萬八九千元，棧單十三萬五六千元，生砂赤十三萬元至十二萬九千元，棧單十月萬六七千元，現貨均跌二萬元以上，廣帮之　　靑亦降萬元，以十二萬三千元至十一萬八千元，開二百餘包，汕帮提莊靑十二萬五千元，成交數十包。</p>

<h3>華股又逢阨境　跌風布滿全場</h3>
<p>華股昨恐怖氣氛加重，市況更無維持，慘跌不已，晨初開出已低，開後一九九號二一五號一四二號一二二號六一號　袂售出，遞永紗乃降低至六二五元以內，迨後金市小定，七六號二二四號一四五號四號一五四號四七號咸進，曾回好至六五七元，十時一刻後，金市復疲，八九號八三號八五號二二九號九九號六一號咸售，二三二號一九八號中途有納而多盤，無奈金價一再下降，某銀行虧損十億元而吿倒閉，二二九號二三三號八三號一五四號冉售，九九號二八號猛拋現　紗，終於破六〇〇元關，現勤興首吿跌停，信　景綸美亞亦相繼吿跌至限度，人心更怯，金市助　，近午遞永紗曾見五八五元低價，經一四號四七號來進，午收　穩，較前收計永紗景　新光華一體各跌一成左右，美亞信和勤興跌成半，遞交永紗景福跌一成，美亞華　跌半成强，信和新光跌一成半，冷股開做者不多，景綸獨跌成半，午後上塲即因金價慘降至三一〇萬內，一八六號二一五號均售遞永紗，降至五七五元，一二四號二一二號來進，金市見昂，而回升至六一〇元外，二一八號二一五號均售，雖有回低，但因一七七號二二四號一六九號　解，再升至六一六元，無何金市回降，一四五號八九號二二九號九九號一六號一七一　號陸續脫售，現永紗再退至五八〇元光景，七六號臨收有納，低後稍穩，結果較前收計永紗信和跌一成强，美亞景　勤興新光各跌一成半，華　跌半成强，冷股成交寥寂，有成交者絕少，　安跌二成弱，景綸小成半弱，大通微升，餘者　挫，遞交永紗跌一成，華轉降半成强，餘者均跌一成半弱，塲外各股稍有回跌。</p>
<p>外股昨再下游，惟低價時有投資者稍加維持，結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德　各跌一成弱，餘者均跌半成左右。</p>
<h3>原料最多只能維持一月　繅絲業將全部停工　盼政府貸款貼補速謀救濟</h3>
<p>繅絲業公會理事長褚輔成昨日接見記者稱：（一）該會所　江浙皖三省京滬二市各會員本有一百五十餘家，然目前正式開工者尙不足五十家，且開工各廠之原料最多祇能維持一月，在陰曆年底前後行將全部停工，以待明年五月閒新繭上市，始能開工，此係目前　織業主要之威脅。（二）此次赴　　願，曾得蔣主席之面允，除目前作一般之救濟外，並擬於明年度政府預算中列入繅絲業貼補費一項，因蠶絲出口對政府外匯及蠶農之生活關係甚大，目前我國　絲在美國市塲因與低廉日貨競銷，每担的須虧蝕三分之一，故政府如不加貼補，整個繅絲業均將陷於崩潰。（三）目前政府對繅絲業救濟，已由行政院令中　公司與中央銀行協商提高收購秋絲價格，目前尙未有最後決定，每担的在六萬元左右。中蠶公司已將最後一批秋繭全部撥給各廠代繅，以維工人生活。至貸款問題，除已成立繅工貸款，按每擔一百四十萬元貸給外，機械　　備之貸款，按每，繅絲車作抵，貸款二百萬元，則尙在協商中。（四）繅絲業之盛衰，對整個國民經濟關係至大，故深盼政府能從改良蠶種繭質，及協助各絲廠大量添購最新式之機械設備入手，因日　三百斤可繅絲一担，而中國之土繭須六百斤始能繅絲一担，同時機械設備澈底改善後，不僅可增加縱絲量及改　絲質，同時更可减低　絲之成本，如此始能在國際市塲與日絲作競爭，也祇能如此，始可稱澈底改善整個之繅絲業。</p>
<h3>茶商擬再請願　要求政府收茶</h3>
<p>本市茶商因鑑於年關在即，政府收購茶葉辦法迄未見公佈實行，爰於目前第議討論，緊急朮救辦法，一致決定再度遺派代表晋請願，代表廿一人，全國各茶區均派有人員參加，由前中茶公司總經理　景　主其事，聞連日各方正分頭討論晋京日期，再據半官方消息中央信託局對於收購茶葉原則業經確定，暫以綠茶着手，其中屯綠佔百分之七十，平水綠茶佔百分之卅，現正在硏討收購茶葉標準云。</p>
<h3>進口業之厄運　前訂外貨不及限期進口　要求輸管會通融辦理</h3>
<p>本市進出口商業回　公會，自進口貿易暫行辦法　　後，各同業所訂外貨，由於事先無充分準備，事後更無法補救，故對於上月十七日修正辦法公佈以前訂購之貨物，輸管會通知各行商，統限於明年二月底以前，一律裝運到埠一節，各行商聞訊之下，大起恐慌，，據該會秘書周經爲談稱：各同業前訂之貨，一部份堆積　國海岸碼頭，目前正候船裝運，尙有部份猶在美國各內地口岸，因美海員罷工時關甚長，所有海“碼頭，各國訂購之貨物堆積如山，倉棧均告無法容　，海運現雖恢復，但該批物資，，如欲全部運完，仍非數月不辦，至未到海岸碼頭之物資”更無論已，現輸管會限於二月底以前，運到上海事實上多不可能，除繼續召集各同業開會商討外，並擬要求輸管會諒解商人痛苦，予以適當解決。</p>
<h3>印棉春季出口配額　增加一倍至二倍半</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿三日電〕，印度政府頃己明令核發毛頭在十六分之十一呎及以下棉花配額五〇〇·〇〇〇包之出口執照，以便在正月至四月期內輸出。各行商在一九四六年十二月止出口期間輸往各國，美國除外之出口執照，不論已領未領，將加發執照若干紙，其數量得爲本年十二月止核准之二·五倍。至轍美執照，將另外核發，其數量得與一九四六年止期內核准者相同。又正月至四　期內指撥　往聯合　國之配額，巳定爲一二五·〇〇〇包。上　五及　六紡細　管理局會　上，曾討論布匹亟須增產事，又各中心區，實際上可能採用三班制，亦曾昨加討論。</p>
<h3>華僑復業貸款　緬甸開始貸放　菲律賓與暹羅區尚在籌備中</h3>
<p>政府爲援助僑胞在海外復興商業所具辦之復業貸款，緬甸及菲律賓兩區，由交通銀行負責辦理，貸款總額各爲美金五百萬元。茲悉：緬甸貸款業已開始，菲律賓則尙在籌備，惟緬甸因太平洋戰爭期問之損失，迄今不復，社會尙未安定，故一般商業恢復尙須待以時日。貸款用度極少，現交行在仰光方面所貸出者，爲數甚微，大部均屬房地產抵押放款，至菲律賓方面，因貸款需我領事證明，目前尙在辦理手續，據交行消息，菲島貸款，菲分行儲款以待，隨時可行，惟據一般觀察，以此次貸款限額過小，信用貸款每戶限一千美金，抵押一萬　金，對大商家補益不多，同時菲島華僑比較　有，一般亦可憑信用向美訂貨，且向國外銀行借款，利息極低，預料將來貸出爲數不多，中國銀行辦理之　越區復業貸款二百五十萬美金，暹方該行已派員前往籌備，並就地於該國當局協商，並由外交途徑交涉，以謀打開暹外匯統制之障礙，越南　　因法越衝　，河內中行辦事處己遷西貢，須待局勢稍稍好轉，即行開始舉辦。</p>

<h3>教部最近三年　邊疆教育工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕邊疆教育委員會，於三十三年一月間，在重慶舉行第四屆會議，三十四年，因勝利復員，致第五屆會議未及召開。此三年間，國步會一度進人最艱危之時代，敎都邊教設施，不能不順應局勢，艱苦撐持，徐謀發展。大抵在日寇投降以前政府爲策應盟車反攻，軍需孔急，邊敎事業，大受限制，如邊政學院蘭州語文訓練班等，均無法籌設。然邊疆敎育關係國防至鉅，敎部仍就人力財力之所及，黽勉從事，除海疆學校喇嘛職校及中央西北兩大學邊政系照常籌設外，並致力於原有學校素質之改善。迨勝利復員，邊敎事業益見艱鉅，後方區各邊校經費之維持，敎師生活之安頓，敎材設備之供應等，旣不容中斷，而收復區之復員工作，更須配合邊疆新形勢之發展，迅謀推進。現第六屆會議將於廿六日開幕，敎部已將三年來邊教設施，準備報吿於第六屆會議，大要如下：</p>
<p>直轄事業　（一）書科與中學：邊疆專科學校，除原設之邊疆學校外，三十三年敎部復應收復東南海疆之需要，成立海疆學校一所，近更應西康地方當局之請求，擬將原　於該省之康定師範，改爲師範專科學校，正呈院請示中。中學方面，除湟川河西兩中學一度改辦邊疆敎育外，現僅有伊盟中學一所。（二）師範敎育：邊地師範學校，原有師範學校十所，計設於設南者三，設於西康甘肅者各二，設於貴州青漲寗夏者各一，並於伊盟中學附設師範班。近應收復地區之需要，復於熟河，察哈爾，遼北，興化，各設師範學校一所。新疆境內之天山葱嶺師範，亦在進行籌備中。師範學校之學制，自三十四年度起稍有變軍，肄業年限一律改爲四年。（三）職業敎育：邊地職業學校，共有八所，，計設於靑海西康四川者各二，設於甘肅寗夏者各一。科系複難，大多因地制宜而設：有重畜牧者，有重農林者，有並重農牧者，有專重紡織者，並有醫事，獸醫，農產畜產製造等之設置，率按當地建設之需要爲準。就肆業年限言，有二年三年四年五年不等，此亦因地方特殊情形權爲酌定者。敎部爲確定邊地職業學校之學制起見，已規定邊地初級職校，悉改爲四年制，課程標準正着手擬訂中。（四）小學敎育：綏寗康藏等地所設小學，已達十七所，連師範附小合計，共爲三十四所。（五）社會敎育：敎部對邊地社會敎育，向由各校兼辦，每年由部酌撥收音機幻燈機等器材，令各校組織巡廻施敎朦劇團等，巡廻各邊地施敎，其他推廣事業如辦理民衆識字學校，開放診療所等，亦有若干學校頗著成績。</p>
<p>地方邊教　（一）後方區各設省；各省扒行邊教，咸有相當歷史，惟過去不免各自爲政，所表現者亦各有不同，敎部爲謀切合邊地需要起見，特訂定各邊省推進邊敎三年（卅三至卅五年）計劃，就小學，社敎職業各方面酌定標準，飭就經費人才可能範圍內，擬定實施計劃，呈准實施。計邊令訂定者，有川，鎭，甘，寗，康五省，至綏遠靑海二省，因情况特殊，只據擬定三十四年度計劃，貴州廣西兩省，據報已無另行實施邊敎必要，新疆則以全省敎育，幾全屬邊敎範圍，故祇擬訂敎育行政計劃。就實施結果而論，各邊省對於邊敎之設計與實施，大體尙稱努力，其中以川，滇，甘，康四省，因經費人才較爲充裕，成績亦較良好，靑，寗，新，綏等省才之。惟蒙旗地方敎育，因經費師資兩感困難，各旗所設小學，因陋就簡，有待改進者尙多，中等學校則均付闕如。敎部對各邊省，歷年均撥邊教補助費，以資鼓勵。計卅四年度補助甘，寗，靑，康，川，滇，新，綏，察，九省公私立學校經費，共爲二，二九四，〇〇〇元，本年增爲一三，九九〇，四〇〇元，直接撥給各校領用。（二）收復區各邊省；東北及熱察綏蒙旗地區，在敵僞侵佔期間曾大量設校實施奴化敎育，以　我邊胞。復員時，受戰事影響，接收遲遲，致該區敎育陷於停頓。敎部爲鼓勵地方設校並迅速完成復員工作起見，特訂頒　旗敎育緊急措施要點，通令施行，規定凡在收復區各　旗地方中小學及社敎機關，過去具有相當當視綫，今後教學無若何困難者，應由省或盟旗政府就人事經費許可範圍，設法恢復。經費方面，本部接次列規定，機給復員補助費：評高級中學補助三百萬元，初級中學補助二百萬元，完全小學補助一百萬元（社敎機關同），初級小學補助六十萬元。師資方面，應聘用合裕人員，或就原有師資施以短期特種訓練，分發各校任敎。此外如廣東海南島黎民敎育，台灣高山族敎育，亦巳由敎部分飭粵台爾省擬具計　推進中。</p>

<h3>復旦大學各系　競設學術講座</h3>
<p>復旦大學學生，近來對於研究學術空氣，漸趨濃厚，此不得不歸功於該校中國文系創導之功。自該系主辦之文藝講座開始以來，，嗣後各系均相繼活躍。昨日該校即有兩次演講，一爲政治系敦請之我國駐荷大使　　氏演講「歐洲問題」另一爲心理學系敦請之高覺敷敎授演講」新心理硏究之技術」聞星期五下午，該校中文系，復敎請章靳，周予同兩敎授主講文藝講座，政治學系敦請徐蔚南氏演講「新聞界的展望」。此類風氣，誠堪爲他校效法。</p>

<h3>台杯決賽開始</h3>
<p>美澳兩國勝負預測</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社墨爾缽廿四日電〕臺雜斯　杯決賽，定廿六日開始在此舉行，美澳兩國單打選手陣容已公怖，計廿六日單打兩組，勃朗雜區（澳）對許洛特（美），配爾斯（澳）對克拉茂（美），廿七日雙打一組，名單尚未宣怖，廿八日單打兩組，勃朗雜區對克拉茂，配爾斯對許洛特，澳洲球迷認爲美方以克許兩人出馬，實與澳洲有利。美國臺杯隊長不選派克與克拉茂合作，實爲失策，因派克會有臺杯決賽經騐，許洛特則爲新進人材。惟美方此種陣容，亦有生意在焉，因在最近　梨雜多利亞綱球賽中，許洛特會在半決賽中擊敗配爾斯，但在決賽中敗於勃朗雜區之手，如此許洛特在臺杯單打中可勝一組，克拉茂球　在許浼特之上，定可擊敗配爾斯　，果爾美國可勝兩組。克拉茂爲美國冠軍，勃朗雜區爲澳洲國手，兩入勢均力敵，克拉茂若獲勝，則五賽三勝，利亞賽，故成績不易評定。</p>

<h3>濟南廿四小時</h3>
<p>— 本報濟南特派員范麗天</p>
<p>廿日航訊</p>
<p>飛機在濟南着陸後，首先映入眼簾的是機塲四週的無數堅强工事和碉堡。機塲而積的四方公里，兩天以前，（時膠濟綫尙未正式通車）這還是濟南與外界聯絡的唯一交通運輸綫，先後嘗有六千多架飛機載運着各級大小文武戰鬥員，補給品，物質的或精神的，確保了它的安全，使道寬闊的五十公里八十萬人口的孤城，雖處共軍四面硬打軟吃下，仍能免遭浩刧，屹立無恙，而首當其衝祖負着此項最艱鉅任務的，便是王兼司令官佐民的左右手，現任緩區副官長趙子良將軍。</p>
<p>二將軍介謁　綏區李副司令官</p>
<p>趙將軍和吳戾天將軍都是記者的舊交。遠在八一三上海抗戰期間，我們就一見如故，成爲戰地最知己的朋友。這次他們知道記者米濟南，由於他們的熱誠招待，眞有「賓至如歸」，「他鄉遇故知」之感，使記者深深地體味到友情的溫暖和深厚。</p>
<p>趙吳兩將軍首先爲我介紹了綏區李副司令官仙洲，羅參謀長幸理及龍主任軸雲等高級負責人。李副司令官爲黃埔一期名將，「山東三李」（餘二爲李延年，李玉堂，）之一。高高的身材，圓圓的面孔，神釆奕奕，精神健旺，只是鬢髮已略見斑白，足見他在抗戰期間爲國辛勞。著名的山西忻口及安徽阜陽等役，均親身參與，不知爲抗戰史上寫下多麼光輝的篇章。</p>
<p>马副军长谈　黄埔逸事一大套</p>
<p>時巳近午，李等的記者用膳。席間，我們由共軍作亂山東的經過，談到「外戰外行，內戰內行」，更由在座關中，馬副軍長志超亦係一期老大哥，談到他最初投考黃埔時的趣聞軼事。他侃侃地同時也很坦率地叙述着：他當初因程度太差，感於投考无錄取把握，乃於考前先行晋謁校長，（即委座），瀝陳軍校與一般學校性質不同，對邊遠省份投考生應從寬錄取。委座從其請，乃於其報吿上批一、「准予破格錄取」俟臨考試时，恰由王柏齡先生任主考，王氏臨試前，首先宣佈約法三章，即：自認有木領的來考，無本領的自己退出去。絕對不准舞弊，錄取標準根據成績。人情關說，概作無效。當時自動退出考塲放棄考試的，竟達十餘人。當時馬氏絲毫不爲所動，及考至數理化時，馬氏迎一個題目都答不出，繳了白卷，深恐名落孫山，乃不得不上書王柏齡，瀝訴苦情後，並繼之以恫嚇：「苟不錄取，只有拼命」。王氏膽小，結果果然取了！</p>
<p>大砲王柏龄　嚇得人心驚內跳</p>
<p>馬言至此，猶不勝　往之情。李副司令官當爲補充　：「王柏齡素有王大砲之稱，但雖謂大砲，其膽最小。王氏嘗語人：「人家呌我大砲，我確是個大砲」，但我這個大砲，只要聽到大砲一響，我就心驚肉跳了！」　座爲之鬨然。</p>
<p>馬氏擅詞令，性詼諧，他又談及他十七年任團長時與同期同學陳德法同去謁見委座，委座請他們吃過飯後，馬氏深恐逗留過久，或有缺點，易爲委座發覺，當即請示於委座，對渠等帶兵作戰有何指示？委座略一思索，即順上吿曰：「你們兩位帶兵，只是陳德法一人的名字，就是不「得」法』。馬氏辭出後，大大的抱怨陳德法，不是他的名字，委座或許也想不到這個「考語」。陳氏現担任迪化警備司令，可謂已經「得法」了。</p>
<p>飯後，李副司令官等忙着開會，記者就邀由山東公報吳副社長等陪同訪問了此間六家日報，六家通訊社和六家期刊，這裏的通訊社，除中央社外，如春秋社等，亦皆能按日發稿，使報館外勤，大有「無法競爭」之勢。報紙的銷數自三千至萬餘份，在形如圍城中的濟南，一切物質條件皆感缺乏的情形下，　正象微着新聞同業的苦鬥精神。</p>
<p>王主席勤政　每日只睡四小時</p>
<p>下午五時，王兼主席佐民邀宴。王氏自兼任省府主席後，事務繁忙，以致每日只能睡眠四小時，而在此謹有的四小時中，猶不時被電話機所攪擾。我們一別六年，第一個感覺就是王氏雖宵旺勤勞，在一身而繫山東之安危的艱鉅任務下，仍雙目烱烱，體魄健壯，一如往昔，足見立殊勳成大業的先決條件，不僅是知仁勇兼全，而拙壯的體力，尤爲其先決條件中之條件。王兼主席今天雖已由國家寄以重任，但其待人之誠實懇摯，處事之認眞不苟。在工作中力求進步的傳統傷風，初不因位高而稍有變易。在席間，王主席嘗提到，我們最初相識時，他還只是一個師長，但十年來的記者還只是一個記者，相形之下，能不汗慚？然王主席仍一本其過去的作風坦白誠摯，關愛備至，這也是記者之所以爲記者之唯一値得安慰之所在吧。</p>
<p>四菜又一湯　吃飯時接見記者</p>
<p>由于王主席太忙，所以只能利用吃飯時間來接見記者。飯是四菜一湯，今天因在座尙有李副軍長琰等十人，盤碗較大，另加四碟稀飯小菜，大家吃來都很舒適實惠。在吃飯中間，王主席問到我許多關於京滬二地的情况，使我倒反而沒有時間叩詢他關於山東軍政鈑貌。吃飯終了，省府劉秘書長道亢已在會客室等候多時，因此記者只得改期再的請王主席說明魯省現况了。</p>
<p>王主席住處是濟南舊德國領事館。記者在夜色深沉中踏上寓所時，街上行人往來如鐵，各店夜市亦一，如往昔，除掉街口的堡壘和馬路上每隔數十或百餘步用鐵刺紥成的柵門和可以通電的鐵刺木架在明亮的街燈下矗立着，或多或少地顯露出一點戰時氣氛外，整個濟南市，仍平靜地躺在四里山和馬鞍山的山根。</p>
<p>二十四小時中所接觸到的濟南委實是太少，這裏且作爲今後通訊的一個楔子吧。</p>

<h3>彭蠡湖畔的豐稔</h3>
<p>— 本報特的記者兪寗頗</p>
<p>鄱陽六日訊</p>
<p>法國經濟學家格尼說：「有生命之個人的富，即動物體的富爲其血，而社會體的富，即爲物。「物即指農產品而言，因爲農產品，可引外界的提取，即能增加社會體的富。換句話說：一國一省一縣一鄉有了社會體的富，則一國一省一縣一鄉的經濟和賦稅，都奠定了它的源泉和基礎。</p>
<p>贛北沿鄱湖各縣農作物產的蘊藏，實具備上項社會富的條件，它和贛河，撫河，修河，信河，饒河，五大支幹流域，可說是江西生產界的驕子，也是全省農產品的府庫所在，在東南數省中，江西被稱爲富庶之區，亦就賴此鄱湖和贛，撫，修，信，饒，五大生產區爲其最力的支柱。</p>
<p>記者今就贛北沿鄱湖各縣本年農作物最著的稻穀，青靛，蔗糖，蓮子，棉花，烟草，等的產銷情形，窺探所得，作一個間賅的報導：但着手來寫這篇通信，腦子裏就深印着那偉大的湖水，含有多量的欣羨－羨它能够孕育出這許多關於有益人生的衣食原料。所以對沿湖的每一產品，特提出它的功用和旨趣，不以物類而單稱，俾與動靜俱生的湖水，兩相配合，而益顯它的偉大無涯。</p>
<p>東南糧倉　荒年不聞枵腹</p>
<p>贛北饒河昌江，樂江各縣，地濱鄱湖，平原沃野，灌溉便利，爲最　宜耕作之區，古語有云：「江西熟，東南足。」這話的確不錯。據江西通志載：淸初全省稻田，有四千七百八十二萬七千餘畝，民二十年立法院統計處估計，全省稻田，有四千一百六十三萬餘畝，省府經委會估計，全省農田爲五千二百萬畝，其中可種稻田，平均扯作六成五，每畝每年米穀產量，年收一次至二次合併計算起來，豐收之歲，至少可產穀一萬三千二百十五萬八千餘石，民二十五年省府統計室根據八十三縣的報吿：總計早稻，中稻，晚稻，糯稻，有一萬一千九百餘萬石，除供木省民食和銷用外，每年可剩餘稻穀二百萬石，其中剩餘三分之一的數量，俱在鄱湖各縣倉庫產生出來的。　又據二十二年江西省政府經委會估計沿湖各縣讓稻數量計餘干二·七八〇·〇〇〇担，萬年九八二·八〇〇担，餘江一·三三八·七五〇祖，星子四一八·三三五担，都昌一·五一四·八五二祖，湖口六四七·五一六担，鄱陽四。四六六·九〇〇担，浮梁一·六五六·六〇八担，樂平一·九四六·五八〇担，德興七五六·〇〇〇祖，民二十四年饒河區產稻數量，計早稻有三·三〇九，六〇〇担，中稻九九七·六〇〇担，晚稻一·九一二·二〇〇担，糯稻二七七·二〇〇石，總計六·四九六·六〇〇石，以濱湖十縣佔全省八分之一的一隅，稻產有這麼多的數量，眞不愧乎糧倉的命名了。</p>
<p>今歲濱湖各縣的早·中晚·稻·雖夏間曾一度險遭白水的冲泛，但基本圩堤，多未決口，秋後久晴，稻田轉險爲安，秋收結果，普稱豐稔，萬（年）稻的收獲量，允溢倍於豐年，估計沿湖各縣稻產，平均差有足額收成，自力更生的農民，它們耗去了力和汗的辛勞，換來了滿車滿庫黃金色的稻粒，便生斯食斯的男婦老幼，都得含脯鼓腹，過着物阜民康的昇平日子。碰着荒歉之年，可把剩餘，補他不足，所謂兇年不戲啼　，轉瞬冬耕停作，正是它們休息的餘閑，試瞧那湖畔農家，寒夜聚農三四，噓烟烤火，互談桑麻，開始作它們的爐邊閒話。</p>
<p>色染天藍　增美靑衫不少</p>
<p>土靛遠在數千年前由印度傳種我國的，爲染料中最古的有色植物，鄱湖上流的樂平，鄰接湖濱，氣候溫和，土層深厚，土壤爲不濕的粘土，朝露夜潮，爲最宜植靛之區。靛屬一種藍草，有藝藍，苜藍之分，　藍成靛染色，初看鮮艷光澤，但久則翻靑，漸失染色效能，苜藍成靛染色，看似暗淡無光，有安安南的色相，靛漿能保持數年不透色。</p>
<p>樂平靛靑產量，過去年約四十萬至五十萬市石，　藍佔三分之一，苜藍佔三分之二，全縣種靛面積，的三四十萬畝，靛農約二十萬人，每畝產靛量，蓼藍自一市石半至二市石，苜藍自二市石至三市石，在洋靛未侵內銷的時候，內地手工紡織的寳藍，月藍，靑藍，土布，都用土靛染色，那時樂靛染坊，多至七十餘家，大的有技工百餘人，這算是樂平靛業的黃金時代。自被洋靛輸入侵銷，用者以它價廉工省，原有工靛市塲，日趨狹溢。抗戰發生後，洋靛絕塞，土靛需要復興，又漸漸的昂起頭來，去歲產地市價每百斤由三四千激漲至七萬出關，靛農和靛商，無不大獲其利。</p>
<p>今歲樂地藍靛收穫，允見豐於往年，月來價格，雖見低落，仍在五六萬間盤旋不墮，津滬蘇杭潯省各地，還有輸銷，種靛的農民，以去年豐於收益，只知先盡地利，再祝奢酬。每値深秋藍苗成熟時，河邊木桶排列，嗚嗚攪靛之聲。觸見充聞，不稍停息，它們一種動工樂業的精神，表現於每一個靛農眉宇笑語間，內地農村質樸無華的男婦服着天然美的藍掛靑衫，都是經過它們的力和汗相換而來的。</p>
<p>甘之如飴　象徵文化進步</p>
<p>贛省爲我國糖產重要區域，產地幾遍全省，而尤以舊贛州，饒州·兩府屬爲最著，鄱湖上流的樂平·德興·等縣，甘蔗種植頗廣，甘蔗就是製糖的最好原料，在沿湖澆河區的產蔗縣份，有鄱陽·浮梁·萬年·樂平·德興五縣，上列五縣中蔗糖的產量，以樂平爲最富，樂產甘蔗，幹長而甜。在饒河區所產的甜蔗命名，多以樂蔗稱之。</p>
<p>全境栽種面積，計樂平有蔗田七·三五〇畝，萬年五二〇畝，鄱陽一·〇〇〇畝，浮梁五·四三八畝，德興四·二〇〇畝，樂平年產量有五五三·〇〇〇担，萬年四三·〇〇〇祖，浮梁一九〇·三三〇担，鄱陽六〇·〇〇〇担，萬年二二·五〇〇担，總興一三·四〇〇担，在民十六七年，樂德兩縣土製糖廠，共有七十餘家。輸出糖値，不下八十餘萬元，餘江年產糖九萬担，萬年二萬担，餘干十一萬担，合計輸出總値，稍决於樂平，製出的糖，均屬赤砂·乾塊·兩種，雖外糖大量在內地傾銷，因爲赤白質味的不同，紅白各有各的銷路。在近抗戰期間，外糖來源吿閉，內地用戶，都取蔗糖而代之，銷量逐歲增加，價亦隨漲，距今十年前，蔗糖每担市價，僅七八元至十五六元不等，去歲已狂漲至五萬到七萬元。</p>
<p>今歲產地農民，以糖的收益頗豐，都大量的從事生產，上月旬已開始收蔗，本月內可全部竣，產量比去年增加，各糖廠坊，正準備置車熬製，糖戶陳貨，早吿稀薄，多趕新糖應市，現市陳糖，眞尖九萬，赤砂八萬五千，原水赤砂六萬，漏水三萬，將來市價，還有增漲可能。</p>
<p>最鈑七八年來，蔗糖產銷的俏，實爲增厚蔗農莫大的利源·產地糖戶，除日常嗜用作果品外，許多食物，都用糖製，似象徵產糖區的人民悠閒地度過它們甜美的生活，又和文明與物並行的學說：「文化進步的國家，糖的消費量亦最多。」這樣說來，不僅是增長地方的財富，且更促成地方文化的進步。</p>
<p>香飄紅藕　湖間遍貼荷錢</p>
<p>鄱陽地多平原，且富湖沼，農民因地制宜，栽蓮極盛，蓮子產量亦最豐，爲鄱農一年主要的收益副業。鄱蓮出品，不亞湘產，粒大粉厚，質味殊佳，蓮分紅白兩種，紅的較盛，質以白的較優地湖沼，全屬沒骨圩泥，濕鬆肥沃，栽蓮頗易，農民不費辛力的隨意隨地佈種，任它自然的生長。至蓮熟剝收子後，冬間湖水乾涸時，繼續地挖掘藕根，或作菜看，或製藕粉，都稱珍味。鄱蓮市價，戰前每担，祇二三十元，近年價逐增高，去年產地售價九萬至十一萬，本年新產白蓮，月來已升至十八萬元，輸銷於滬蘇潯漢各埠。</p>
<p>湖蓮最怕的是白水冲泛，傷損荷莖，莖經被折，不能滋長蓮房，子遂衰萎，如果沒有水災之年，出產旣獲豐收，尤其是荷莖壯茁，蓮葉田田，紅白含葩，晨夕開吐，襯托出一種天然有色的畫圖。果便你讀過愛蓮說那篇文章，去看湖間亭亭玉立的蓮房香藕，魚戲荷錢那樣的風趣，莫不油然地和周子發生同樣愛癖的感！</p>
<p>衣被生民　禦寒堪抵絲帛</p>
<p>贛北饒屬各縣，爲鄱陽湖畔的冲積地，是最宜棉作之區，全省植棉面積，亦以都昌·鄱陽·餘干·萬年·湖口·樂平·浮梁·諸縣爲最廣，棉種多屬中棉，有白籽。黑籽。光籽二種，品質優良的，首推湖口白籽棉，爲全省棉中最佳的品種，即在國內中棉品級中，亦佔有相當的地位，滬漢市塲稱爲九江花者，即屬此棉。它的特　，爲發育强，生產富，每畝籽花收穫，價在一百一十斤至二百斤，祇因纖維粗短，不能紡織二十支以上的棉紗，其他之一至八分之五吋，只能紡八至十六支棉紗，以視他省改良的中美棉種品質，瞠乎其後。</p>
<p>過去較棉銷路，如九江·湖口棉，大半供銷潯市久興紗廠所購用。其餘的多供自用，或爲內地手工織布，據九江關統計贛棉輸出數量，以民十九年爲最多，計有七〇·八〇九擔，比之陝鄂江浙等省棉花的輸出量，是百不殆一耳。</p>
<p>今幾各縣棉產，以一般而言，尚稱豐稔，惟棉田面積，比前增加，但因今夏雨量過多，發育不長，入秋後天氣亢旱，棉作後期發育，稍受阻碍，較之第一次估計時，略有遜色，以各地棉田的增植，平均生產數量，當不致短少，本年新花上市的時候，花販零進籽棉市價，每斤自六百至一千，的折皮棉一擔，合價二十四五萬元，比去年的增十倍，月來各販行莊，因價格的提昂，湖江花市，開十七萬至十九萬元，花銷已趨黯淡，棉農收穫的花，亦多扳緊不售。</p>
<p>它們植棉的原旨，第一是求自用，如果銷俏價漲，則以剩餘的沽出，銷滯價落，則悉數儲藏，以備隨時爲被絮棉衣的需，婦女能紡紗的紡紗，能織布的織布，紡織不能的，則以花換布，只求禦寒，不慕衣錦，任市上有疋如何的在漲，它們是簡直不受絲毫影響的。大有印聖甘地的作風，自種自紡自織自穿，是一種不求人的自力更生主義。至於那絲綢和毛織品，更與它們距離好遠，始終和它是不發生衣緣的，「布衣暖，菜根香生產滋味長」，這彷彿　它們現實生活的寫照。</p>
<p>噓煙一縷　透出畢樣清芬</p>
<p>贛省烟葉產區，有南雄·瑞昌·進賢·瑞金·廣豐·都昌。鄱陽·等縣，烟質的優，以南雄·瑞金爲最。鄱陽次之，都昌又次之，鄱都種烟的面積頗廣，爲農村主要副業收入的大宗，戰前贛烟輸出總値，年有三百餘萬元，農民種植烟草，多寡不一，大半栽在平原空隙間，栽種的手續，農歷三四月間，將　　的烟籽散播下種，用豆餅作　料和於烟田的泥土中後，耕耘一次，築成一條的土壟，經過一定時間，將烟苗秧移植在烟田上面，五六月間，即長成烟草，再過一個短時間，就可收穫，烟葉的收　過程有兩期「伏葉」和「秋葉」，伏葉的質味較優，價較貴，收穫期在伏暑天氣，秋葉是秋期收穫的，質見遜，價較低。</p>
<p>現在物價在漲，烟絲每爾售價百餘元，農民對畢煙的嗜好頗深，爲它們田間操作不可須臾比的一個好伴友。產地的烟農爲免利源外溢，多以自種的烟葉，自已紥創製烟絲，自種自製自吸，它們吸烟的烟筒，都是用竹根製的，上繫裝烟的烟袋，日常插在腰間無論是閑忙時候，都不可一時無此君，偶持敬客初嘗，噓烟一綫，特別透出異樣消芳的香味來，這「相思草」消遺的功能，並不亞於「寒夜客來茶當酒。」</p>

<h3>台灣十大航線</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>花蓮港十一日航訊</p>
<p>從日本人裏接收過來的台灣省，今春幾個月的悄景是不堪回憶的，那種紛雜擠軋，誤點的情形，到現在還沒使人忘記；，可是道畢竟是暫時的過渡的現象，半年來交通的急切改善和整理，已縮短了基隆高雄港口對國內的距離，同時本省人也深感到只有惑謝交通的迅速復原，使台灣成爲名符其實的中國的一省。</p>
<p>最顯著的是鐵路運輸力恢復到百分之一百。原先每天以六十列車運送，現在已達一二〇列。公路方面，幹綫維持每天一班，决要的一天四班，最要的要能達五分鐘一班，像台北到基隆綫。港口的淸理王作，基慶和高雄已打撈起五萬噸的沉船一內有九艘已着陸，還有基隆二條高雄三條正在打撈中。港口的戰時景象，現在巳不再能追尋了。</p>
<p>訊者在旅途花蓮港的旅社裏，和掌握新生合灣交通命脉的任顯羣處長訪談半小時，他對記者說：從來年一月份起到六月止，對內外的航綫將建立八條，還有在下半年度一定要完成的兩條，共有十大航綫，包括：</p>
<p>（一）台灣東綫：從　隆到東部的蘇澳，花蓮港，台東，火燒島，紅頭嶼，高雄，澎湖，以五百噸的船行駛，一月間開始。</p>
<p>（二）台灣，厦門，福州三角形航錢。</p>
<p>（三）上海綫：道是定期的航輸，已決定有三艘輪流航行，十天一班，其中一艘，三十六小時可到達。</p>
<p>（四）靑島，天津綫，一月二次。</p>
<p>（五）汕頭，香港綫，一月二次。</p>
<p>（六）溫州綫。</p>
<p>（七）長江綫，直放漢口。</p>
<p>（八）大連綫，時局穩定立即通航。</p>
<p>（九）菲列賓綫。</p>
<p>（十）新加坡綫。</p>
<p>（九）（十）決定在下半年度開始，這個即待實　的　路以外，還準備成立省航空公司，明年度本省空運可以恢復。這些統在兩個政策之下積極展開，主要的著重在政治意義和增加省庫收入——鼓勵來台旅行；其二是決定　隆成爲單純的貿易港，所有的外貨統由該港轉運華南各地；南部的高雄港則成爲對國內，南洋各地交通的重點！目前空隆的倉庫已經由二萬噸的儲藏量擴展到八萬噸，預計明年終達二十萬噸。高雄港則由四萬五千噸期能達十五萬噸，一般的旅行設備也正在設計之中。</p>
<p>在人力物力相當艱苦的台省，要能如期地完成這十條航綫，任處長深瞭解這例須遭遇到的難題。但他坦誠堅決地說，困難只有克服沒有其他辦法。他更指出眼前本省航業的有利條件是價廉，手續簡化，還有就是恰和國內相反的「供過於求」。</p>
<p>任處長深信以他半年來整理交通的精神和經騐，明年的海上交通絕不致成爲問題。因爲這不但繁榮了本省，而且更加强了孤懸海外的台省對國內的向心力，台灣，國內，兩面的航程縮短了了！基隆，高雄，它也將在世界貿易交通上，重新回復到先前的光榮！」</p>
<h3>九龍行總　貨倉大火</h3>
<p>— 本報特的記者子健</p>
<p>九龍十八日航訊</p>
<p>行政院善救總署在香港對岸九龍半島尖沙嘴漆威道所設的貨倉，十七晚十時半，忽起大火，燃燒一小時半之久。</p>
<p>香港海陸軍亦出動協助救火，因爲當地除行總貨倉外，幷有香港軍事當局的停車塲，停有軍車數百輛。火勢幸未蔓延，即行總貨倉若干汽車及重要器材（包括一副價値六十萬元之車床）亦吿無恙。據目下得知已損失的貨物，內有大批汽車膠輪，的有數百隻，汽油若干桶，其他尙待調查。</p>
<p>行總貨倉在漆威道與加迎威老道交界處，佔地頗大，四週圍以鐵絲網，聯總所運到之車輛及有關用具，均存於此。塲之一端，築有兩木屋爲寫字樓，一存貯車胎，帆布等。另一則爲發電房，緣該處入夜即黑如墨，當局爲保護存貨，免爲歹徒偸竊特自行發電，使四週光亮，看管人易於防範。電機房側，有四個房間，看更人及電機司機均居於此。據稱昨晚開始發電後，司機者外出，不料或因時間過久，熱力太高，不知如何，突使其側之木板燃着，遂做成這個大火的起因。木板的火勢，隨即延及房內什物及存貯車胎帆布之木屋，時火勢更烈。消防隊據報後，三輛滅火車即馳至救援，惟抵達後半小時，始有水到，蓋晚上制水之故也。在水未到達前，消防人員，祇得以滅火筒施救及拆路，使火勢不致蔓延他處，迨開喉時，兩座小木屋幾已燒燬無餘，然因多爲車胎，勢仍甚烈，於燃燒中，常發生類似小爆炸聲，至十一時四十分以後，火勢已完全被控制，十二時許熄滅。當時適吹西北風，未有延及其側之大部車輛。其側有未裝之汽車百數十箱，疊高的三丈，而佔面積達六七丈，另有廿四輛新裝成汽車在加運威老道，鐵絲網下亦有六七輛，此外有價値港幣六十萬元之修理工具車床，均吿無恙。當事發後，聯總工程司結頓立即到塲指揮員工搶救，該最貴重之車床亦係於此時救出者。</p>

<h3>戲劇運動的呼聲</h3>
<p>若干從事戲劇工作的同志，最近在中央文化運動委員會有一次座談會，在家對中國戲劇運動發表的意見很多，當塲推定由余上沅先生執筆整理，以下這篇文章，就是整理的紀錄。希望關心戲劇運動的社會人士，多多協助，俾中國劇運得到正常的開展。</p>
<p>勝利的結束了八年抗戰，我們應該以更充沛的熟情和更積極的努力建設民族獨立，民權自由，民生幸福的新中國，這是每一個中國人民的責任，道也就是每一個戲劇工作者的責任。不幸，在還都，復員以後，在準備展開工作之際，像其他部門的文化事業一樣，戲劇運動竟有着更多的困難。這一年來的經騐吿訴我們，如果不迅速挽救當前的危機，戲劇運動的前途，實在難以樂觀。</p>
<p>抗戰八年的環境是艱苦萬端的，有賴於全國戲劇工作者的精誠團結，在中華全國戲劇界抗敵協會的領導下，各盡所能，全力以赴，曾經奠定了相當穩固的基礎，無論是在後方，前綫，敵後，孤島的上海，無論是在城市，鄕村，都留下了有目共覩的成績，直接的或間接的有助於抗戰。我們不願諱言這一階段中自身的努力不足與某些弱點一同樣的我們也不願忽略客觀環境所加在戲劇運動上的諸般困難。由於問題沒有立即合理的解決，今天還依舊的苦惱着我們，並且，隨着客觀情勢的演變，更有着新問題擺在面前。我們戲劇工作者知道，自己份內的職責是排除萬難以推進戲劇運動，但是，戲劇運動並非與廣大社會絕緣的孤立存在的事物，我們不能不請求社會人士以及政府當局對於戲劇運動的現狀有進一步的認識，同情與協助，使牠順利的渡過當前的危機。</p>
<p>在南京（上海，漢口，以及其他收復區的城市）的劇團－包括國營的，民營的，職業的，業餘的－演不出戲來或者費盡千辛萬苦演出了結果旣少好評更得賠本，乃是普遍的現象，溯其原因，首先是娛樂損的問題。</p>
<p>我們不以爲娛樂捐的問題祇有經濟上的意義，透過『百分之四十』的微收率，分明的把話劇和其他種種娛樂同等看待了，我們不否認話劇的娛樂性，不同的乃是在娛樂之中牠更有着敎育作用—一種廣義的敎育，即提高觀衆（人民）的文化水準，並且，從這裏得到向上的啓發與鼓舞。同時，戲劇恰恰又是國家民族的文化的具體表現。這，正是英國人寗可捨掉印度而不願放棄莎士比亞的理由，也正是我們設立了國立戲劇專科學校而遂未曾想到辦一個培養別的娛樂人才的學府的理由；也正是抗戰期間敎育部和中央宣傳部設置戲劇獎的理由。百分之四十的娛樂捐雖然隨票附徵是加在觀衆身上的，實際上受到損失的還是劇團。假如免徵或減少到百分之五或百分之十，觀衆出同樣的票價，劇團則增加了收入，更可以因此減低票價，吸收更多的觀衆。</p>
<p>一般物價的高漲，明顯的使演出費用大大的增加，一弋演出的全部支出，三四十萬元的數目已經很平常了。其中，絕對宜於節省的即是劇塲租金這一項。中國××劇團來京演出、國民大戲院的租金是每塲（每晚）五十萬元，跟着即漲至每塲一百八十萬元，即使能够減少，也非每塲一百萬元不可。僅容七百人的光明大戲院，如長城劇社所租用的，是每塲六十萬元。由於劇國沒有屬於自己的劇塲，不僅要担負如上的巨額租金，還有無形的損失，如演期的遠近，久暫都不能自由，不僅影響經濟，而且影響藝術——合同不簽定不敢　然開工，合同一經簽定即須如期登台而不容許考慮戲排得熟練與吾，這，更給與我們莫大的痛苦。</p>
<p>戲劇不能離開觀衆。蹉跎至今才得開始的南京戲劇運動，也受到觀衆的影響。我們並非苛責觀衆，這却是事實。由於物價高漲，生活艱苦。一般觀衆的購買力大大降低了，他們即使非常歡喜話劇，每每限於經濟能力而裏足不前，這是一，除去由重慶復員來的一部份人士外，多數在敵偽統治下掙扎過來的人們，即使不曾完全沉淪於低級的娛樂裏，對於話劇也還是比較陌生的，不習慣從話劇舞台上找到他們所需要的事物，難於踴躍了。這是二。假如觀衆要求從話劇舞台上找到他們所需要的事物了，我們又能給與他們什麽呢？反映現實是話劇的一個特徵，當他們感覺到此時此地的舞台與此時此地的生活有着距離。一次失望，一一次就要觀望了。這是三。使觀衆認識話劇，愛好話劇，必須有經常的演出和優良的演出，而這正是一件困難的事情。</p>
<p>如果我們曾無意的使觀衆失望了，那是我們自己的過失。我們承認，這一年來殊少新的劇本，更少適合此時此地需要的劇本。當我們要求劇作家多多寫作之前。還該了解劇作家的處境。事實是這樣的，一方面，到現在爲止的客觀環境，不是一下子就能瞭如指掌的，僅僅看到表而上的現象即加以頌揚或暴露，是創作的歧途。這需要時間，一方面，當演出（以及發表·出版）如此困難的時候，是沒法促使劇作家不斷供給新作的。有人在準備，有人在寫，有人寫了而遲遲不拿出來。這需要環境安定。同樣的，沒有時間與環境安定，不僅劇作家，連導演·演員以及舞台工作者同樣的難於有新的創造，而形成了停滯乃至退步。</p>
<p>戲劇工作者的停滯乃至退步，即是戲劇運動的停滯與退步。反躬自省，我們應該責備自己的認識不够，努力不够，以及團結不够。但是，無論如何，客觀環境的改善是更重要的先決條件。我們深信：社會人士和政府當局是愛護戲劇運動的。因此，在此時此地，我們叙述了當前的實况，並且，希望着：</p>
<p>（一）確認了戲劇在文化與敎育中的地位，給與積極的，有力的，計劃的扶植，使戲劇成爲全國人民的健康的精神食糧，成爲建國工作的重要支柱。</p>
<p>（二）豁免或减輕娛樂捐，凡是國營的劇團和曾經主管機關准予立案的民營的劇團的演出，准免娛樂捐，以减輕劇國的担負，普及觀衆。</p>
<p>（三）建立國營的劇塲，完全免費或取極少的租金，供給劇團。開始的時候，可以徵用敵僞的產業代替建築。</p>
<p>（四）保障戲劇者的生活，使戲劇工作者能够安心的，並專心的從事創造與研究。</p>
<p>（五）獎勵劇本創作與演出。</p>
<p>這是挽救危機的當務之急，這也是我們的呼籲。在我們戲劇工作者，應該如抗戰時期一樣的精誠團結起來，克盡所能，全力以赴，共同克服困難，渡過危機，參加建設民族獨立，民積自由，民生幸福的新中國這一偉業！</p>

<h3>出版與捐稅</h3>
<p>— 傅統先</p>
<p>近來中國出版界發生了兩件大事，都是對於出版事業將產生很大影響的。一件是關於書業營業稅的問題，一件是關於新聞郵電加價的問題。書業和新聞界都在要求政府重新考慮，挽救中國裂落的文化事業。</p>
<p>關於書業的營業稅，我們知道業經上海市參議會議決免徵之後，上海全市書業二百八十六家又推派代表十七人晋京請願，要求財政部免微。但是最近書業公會按奉敎育部轉下財政部咨文，只准國定木及審定本敎科書免繳營業稅，其餘仍須照征。現在書業再推代表赴京請願。我們希望政府特別愛護文化出版事業，准予全部免繳。同時我們更希望本市當局一而按受市參會增收建設損的議決，一面也採納免收書榮營業稅的議決。</p>
<p>關於新聞郵電加價，十七日新聞報有一段富於戲劇性的記載，內云：「今日於化去近一百餘億，修理華　無比，精緻絕倫之交通部大廈中，各地記者一百五十餘人爲郵電加價十倍事向兪部長請願，維持原價，以延續文化事業。因在此高價郵電費用中，全國新聞事業均將蒙受巨大之拙殘。於二小時訴願中，余部長稱，彼無興趣與新聞界爲難。」我們頗知郵電方面政府賠累不少，必須設法彌補。合理的加價和　收營業稅，這是國家的財源，我們原似無庸置啄，但政府對於出版文化事業不能與其他以謀利爲目標的商業作齊量觀，面應予以特別的體卹。</p>
<p>不過在政府特別着重於開源的情形之下，我們覺得政府應整頓稅收，剔除中飽，最要緊的似乎還可以在節流方面多用一點工夫，免得過分在文化事業上打算。</p>
<h3>評中國教育改革之途徑</h3>
<p>— 陳科美</p>
<p>陳果夫著　正中書局出版</p>
<p>凡是對於中國敎育能高瞻遠　的人都感覺到，中國的敎育需要一種哲學，將敎育的實施統整在一個或數個原則之下；不能再像過去那樣，東抄西襲，仿歐效美，以致五十年來的敎育收不到甚麽效果。雖然大家都這樣感覺到，但是很少有人出來供給這一種需要。吳俊升先生曾經提議，先由全國各方面學者對於中國過去文化和現代需要作一綜合的考察，確定一種普通哲學；然後根據此種哲學演繹出幾項指導原則作爲理論和實施的　礎，以構成敎育哲學。這是一種辦法。此外當然還可先由各方面的學者自由發表他們的研究；然後再將這些硏究加以綜合，或加以選擇，而定出敎育理論和實施的原則，作爲一種敎育哲學。或許這兩個辦法均不適用，祇有一任各種思想的自由發展和敎育哲學的自然形成。</p>
<p>民國二十二年，姜琦先生曾刊行一本敎育哲學（亦名三民主義敎育），他的意思是希望牠成爲一種中國敎育哲學：其影響如何，不得而知。現在我又讀到陳果夫先生的中國敎育改革之途徑，也是根據三民主義，提出敎育改革的主張；不過這一本書和前一木書不同，前者偏里純理的方面，而此書則偏重應用的方面，有一套整個的敎育計劃。</p>
<p>這本書的內容，簡單點說，包括兩部份，第一部份討論一般原則與各級敎育；第二部份討論各種敎育問題及有關實行改革之方法等。關於原則方面，「完全以我國固有的倫理哲學爲基礎，而其出發點是孝弟，逐漸擴大，以實現天下爲公，世界大同的理想。」……甚至書中的整個敎育程序或系統，即以我國的修霽治平的哲學系統爲畫分程序的依據，使今後各階段的敎育都有一個顯著的中心口標。」（王跋中語）而這兩部份又以原則爲重要，如作者所說，「我認爲改進敎育，原則爲重，方法問題次之。」。（頁一）所以這書的性質頗有敎育哲學的意味和構成一種教育哲學的可能。</p>
<p>今日需要敎育哲學</p>
<p>作者本其數十年的觀察和體騐　成此書，確有獨到的見解和完備　主張。比如他說，由過教育「失敗的主要原因，在乎我們的敎育失去了自信主動的精神祗有見別人，卻忘了自己；所以祗知抄　，不能消化，更不能　　；」又說，中國敎育失敗的原　　））　　　　找到敎育的出　　　　磁　　　　幾子年來　　　涌薑纏　　瞥　　　了」‘　　　　　　　　　是維　山　　　　觀　　論暱留的倫理觀　’　　　　　口口挪　？就是　　　　細低徑　　　　　是作者　　　　　　　　是作者　　個屆他　　　說見解的本身是　到的，而是說中國今後的敎育一仍　要保持孝弟這重心爲出發點，並發揮其效能」是獨到的。根據這一敎育的出發點，所以作者特別重視家庭敎育，「所以家庭敎育是人類世界一切問題的根本問迦」，是爲一生「立下一個做人的基礎」？由此基礎開始，而「國民敎育」，生活敎育」，「特種教育」，師範敎育，大學敎育，太學敎育等，又均依據條齊治平的哲學立論與設施：這是作者完備的主張。所以這一本書又是一本最能刺激的著作，牠可以刺激中國敎育哲學的創造，也能刺激中國新敎育的開闢。</p>
<p>至於中國的敎育哲學應不應當如此形成呢？中國的新敎育願不慼當照此辦理呢？依筆者淺見，略陳一二，以作菊　之獻。</p>
<p>敎育的出發點</p>
<p>我曾經陳述過，中國文化有兩種特徵；一是倫理的特徵，一是保守的特　；我也曾經批評過，此種倫理特似的文化太注重人間　係中的家族　係，而忽略更演大的社會關係；所以中國人的家族觀念太深，以致民族觀念或社會觀念太薄，而不能產生一堅强統一的民族集團，以抵抗列強的各種侵略（敎育與文化，教育通訊，第三卷，第四十一期）。　管在理論上說得很好，以孝弟爲出發點，「把對於父母，對於兄弟的倫理關係，建立起正常的軌則，由此推延出去，於是社會的秩序，國家的平治，黃可因此維持」；但事實上，中國的人民（尤其受舊敎育最高的人民）多祗知有家，而不知有國，更不知有世界，所謂「天下爲公」或「世界大同」更是說不到了。爲什麼中國數千年來的明倫教育不能敎會人民將悌孝推延到社會去呢？這有兩個原因；一是理想太高，不易實行；二是圈子繞得太大，不能達到。</p>
<p>因此，數千年的明倫教育祇敎成人民過得來家族的生活和維持了宗法的社會；但現在生存競爭如此的激烈，民族鬥爭如此的凶猛，不久就會改造中國的家族生活和宗法社會。</p>
<p>敎育的目標</p>
<p>所以現在要敎人民的是如何謀民族的生存，是使全國民衆能在平時生產建設和在戰時抵抗自衛，是使大家具備生產自衛的智能和團結犧牲的精神；就是「天下爲公」和「世界大同」，也不妨緩一步敎。談到生產自衛的智能，常然以科學爲基礎；談到團結犧牲的精神，也常然以民主爲基礎：祇有科學與民主，才能使中華民族迎頭趕上去；也祇有科學與民主，才能達到天下爲公和世界大同。所以中國的新敎育，應以三民主義爲理想，以民族復興爲目的，以民族化，民主化，科學化，工藝化等爲目樑；或說得更具體點，中國的新敎育要養成能建設和自衛的健全國民。此種新敎育的重心在發揚一種新的民族精神——一種個人與民族打成一片的精神，一種委身於民族的犧牲精神。必須具備此種精神，巾華民族才站得住、必須本民族先站得住，方能謀世界的改造，由家族而民族，由民族而世界，這是要人類社曾演進的程序，也是由國社會必經的階段。此種新敎育的出發點就是個性，根據各個兒童的個性，去發展他的身心，使能分祖民族復興的工作；務使個性的發展和民族的復興配合起來，以適應此亙古未有的大時代。</p>
<p>至於發展兒童身心和發揚民族精神的方法，不必繞很大的圈子，即在利兒童的共同天性和特殊個性，以培養他們的民族情緒和民族意識。例如兒童有共同的好奇心，即可利用牠，去遊覽中國的古蹟名勝，以引起其愛好中國的情緒和認識中國的意識；使感到和知到中國是一歷史悠久的文明民族，使感到和知到中國有地大物博的錦繡河山：如此，兒童願爲本國和本民族而犧牲的精神乃可油然而生。</p>
<p>總之，由國新敎育的理想，宜切合時代的需要；現在時代所需要是什麼？就是民族的鬥爭和民族的生存，也就是養成一般具有民族精神的健全國民，從民族鬥爭之中以求民族的生存。當然我們絕不是不要人行孝悌，不過我們以爲行孝悌的人不一定愛國家民族，而愛國家民族的人却一定也能行孝悌。</p>
<p>敎育的程序</p>
<p>作者說「在小學敎育的階段是一種修身的敎育，要敎以做人的道理的基礎，培植愛國家愛民族的觀念。在初中敎育的階段，要養成個人獨立謀生的技能與知識。在高中敎育的階段，不但要敎育他個人能够謀生，還要能帮助別人謀生。所以中學的階段，可說是「齊家」的敎育。但這裏所說的「家」字，應該推廣作社會解釋。到了大學的階段，就敎以「治國」的敎育，養成他爲國家爲民族謀福利的專門技能。再上爲太學，則敎以「平天下」的教育。這樣，自修身，齊家，治國以至平天下，前後運賞，而又各成段落，實在是一個很好的敎育程序」。（頁一二）這樣依據大學上修，齊，治，平的程序來畫分現在各敎敎育的程序，但是在我們看來，一一者根本性質上並不相同。大學上的敎育程序是養成少數士大夫的敎育程序，而現在各級敎育的程序是培養各級人才的敎育程序，二者根本很難配合起來。大學上的敎育程序和現在敎育程序，其區別是很顯明的。因爲大學上的修，齊，治，平是培養一種人才的全部程序，不能分開來講的；由修身而齊家，由齊家而治國，由治國而平天下，是運貫下去的，不能再分段的。至於現在的各級敎育是培養各級人才，可以各成段落；如作者所說，「每經一階段，即有一階段的功效；每敎一步，即有一步的用途」：無論事實上有沒有做到（中國敎育的大毛病就是沒有做到這一點），原則上是應當如此的。所以中國的新敎育斷不能依據培養一種人才的敎育程序來畫分培養多稱人才的敎育程序。</p>
<p>上舉二點，僅就其最大者論之；他如反芻敎育法，三民主義與各階段敎育的配合，生活敎育等均未暇論及；至於注重母敎，注意各級教育的連　性和獨立性等，均有卓見，未邊詳述。在中國像陳先生這樣以一貫的立塲替中國的敎育找出一個方向，這實在是難能可貴的，雖然我們的意見並不完全相同。總之，這是一本太富於刺激性的著作，是有心中國敎育改革者的參考善本，値得大家的咀嚼和檢討。</p>

<p>無人知道，這些書的所以能有如此廣大的銷數，究竟應歸功於寫作，抑是廣吿，抑還是美國各讀書會的推　。</p>
<p>根據「時代雜誌」的看法，戰後新的文藝天才猶未出現。美國出版界的人物常如此解嘲：離開戰事還沒多久，故而傑作一時還未能完成。但是這是眞實的麽：且看看一九一九（第一次大戰）以後的書目：巴別脫著的「盧梭與　曼主義」，康拉特的「金箭」，凱恩斯的，「和平之經濟後果」，梅斯　爾的「雷那狐」，奧尼爾的「加里比之月」，莫罕的「月與六便士」等，都是那一年的不朽之作。二次大戰給人們的刺敎也許太大，天才們一時還不能通過藝術解答那些複雜的問題。</p>
<h3>「團的兒子」</h3>
<p>— 李錦祥</p>
<p>卡泰耶夫著茅盾譯卅五年十月初版</p>
<p>蘇聯作家卡泰耶夫，他的名字在山國　者的腦子裏也許不會感到陌生吧，七八年前，他的兩部著作「時間，前進呀」，</p>
<p>「我是勞動人民的兒子」都有我國譯本。</p>
<p>「團的兒子」在蘇聯是一本　有火量讀者的小說，它會榮膺一九四五年史太林文　獎，那一年的文　獎金在小說方面，　一共有四個獎。「團的兒子」得的是小說　門的二等獎，得頭等　的是「青年近清軍」和「拉伏伊」，二等獎的另一部小說　是一綠土一。</p>
<p>全書以蘇德戰事爲題材，故事山始至終都在平淡的氣氛中發展。</p>
<p>本書的主人翁凡尼亞是一個孤苦伶仃的俄國孩子。殘暴的野心家毀去了他美麗的家園，　殺了他的父母，使他終年流浪在外面，幸而遇到了祖國的偵察兵，拯救了他並把他帶到自己的團部裏去。</p>
<p>並且，偵察兵們不久就發現了這孩子的天才，聰明，勇敢，富有吸引方，天生是一個偵察兵。可是上司的命令下來了，未成年的孩子不許停留在前綫，他立刻派人把他送回後方。</p>
<p>命令並不能克服人的意志，凡尼亞　決地反對被送同後方面失效後，他　然從　送者的失察下逃走了。</p>
<p>幸運地，他遇到那命令送他同後方去的上司業拉吉耶夫上尉，（當時凡尼亞並不認識他是誰）上尉對他也和其他偵察兵們一樣，聰明和吸引力使他得到一個美好的印象。毫無一疑義的就把孩子帶回部隊去。</p>
<p>凡尼亞的願望滿足了，他現在是一個偵察兵了。當他第一次出去偵察的時候，不幸被敵兵發覺因而被捉。直到敵兵退走時他才得逃脫歸隊。</p>
<p>上尉的遭遇和凡尼亞一樣，年青的妻子，老年的慈母，還不滿七歲的男孩，都被德寇的俯衝殘殺了。所剩下的只是一串的憤怒，悲慘的憶念而已。因此，他對凡尼亞更有一種同病相憐而親切之感，不久就把凡尼亞收爲乾兒子，並爲避免危險起見（偵察兵是很危險的），把他調到砲隊去作一名預備兵。</p>
<p>戰爭本是殘酷無人道的，通天的砲火，血與肉在交流。在蘇德的邊界上來了一决緊張猛烈的坦克車戰。葉拉吉耶夫上尉就在此次戰役中爲國損　了。在他的衣袋中發現了一張小字條，他請求長官照顧他的卷子，把他訓練成一個好戰士。</p>
<p>凡尼亞眞的不久就被送進士官學校，開始他生命史中的一新頁。</p>
<p>故事就這樣結束。作者把每個人的性格都描　出來，淸晰地，使人感覺到書中人物栩栩欲生，這是本書最成功的一點。</p>
<p>「團的兒子」是根據英文譯本重譯的。英文譯本與俄文本稍有差別，俄文本共有廿八章，而英文本只有二十五章。英文譯者把其中一些不大重要的刪去，因此分章也有些不同。中文譯本與英文譯文同，而與俄文本稍有出入。這也是讀者該注意的。</p>
<h3>讀「性心理學」</h3>
<p>— 孟琨</p>
<p>Havelock　Ellis原著</p>
<p>潘光旦譯註　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>芷如作者在本書中時常提到的，現今的人類均已自命爲是够文明了，但對於性的問題，還是多麼的愚昧無知。這一種錯誤的培殖生根，竟可說是我們所處的社會還不足認爲是如何開通，而作者在半世紀前所向歐美人士指摘的話，應用於目前的由國，仍　是十分符合的。</p>
<p>西方人的諱談性問題，是由於宗敎的傳統所束縛，中國另有其畸形的這德觀念。雖本質有異，但是結果是全同的。從原始人傳遺到現時代，關於「性」，人們所給予的神秘帘幕始終不曾揭露。然而如果能把牠視作一空洞的理論，那就放逐到思維領域外去也不打緊，可是又與每一個個人都產生着一現實的密切關係而不能棄却！</p>
<p>因此，雖然，在社會的表面上還未曾能公開地討論，認爲是應討論的事以前，更多的人們是已加以注意過的。只是許多利用靑年心理脆弱和好奇的緣故，大會量的性書早就半明目張膽地流傳在市面上，流傳在靑年們的手與手之間。這一些書，爲了編述者缺少嚴肅能度的緣故，內容往往有偏頗，或甚至於故意歪曲的所在，不僅是無從介紹讀者以應具的常識，反而非科學地常引導出種種不良的後果，反敎育的成　。</p>
<p>神聖的問題</p>
<p>「性」是一神聖的問題，更是一社會敎育家慼負責任的一項　目。性敎育對於國民的重要，不論是精神生活方面，或是羣衆生活方面，都是件切不容怠的急務。歐美人的注意這間題還祇在二十世紀初葉，除了好多硏究的册子先後出版，根據各家獨特的觀點和方法外，定期的刊物也經常地討論着，只是內容偏於醫學或生理。其後，經過了應用作犯罪學的綱目，便漸漸形成了一種有文化意味的單位學科。</p>
<p>本書作者藹理士是較後於福路伊特（Sigmund　Freud）的一位大家，畢生精力差不多都用在這問題的開闢。用他善長文藝的筆觸，他的硏究成果一次一次地通過了印刷而散你到各國家各社會去。他的觀點雖然也是心理的，不過與福氏的全仗純素的「精神分析」不同，因此也便是更科學更進步的了。在本書的刋行前，藹氏早就成名的是性心理舉研究錄（Studies　in　the　Psycology　ofＳex），內容雖豐富，但是不够普遍，作爲一種灌輸常識的手册是欠宜的。直至本書的寫就，才彌補了這一久就盼望了的缺陷。</p>
<p>科學的方法</p>
<p>這一本還不滿三十萬字的書，淺顯地，但是也廣袤地，講述到每一應注意的「性」問題。方法是科學的，更是社會學的人類學的，從　橫的觀點來加以分析和指示，同時亦是敎育的。作者不單是客觀地暴露出一件事實的存在，並且主觀地加以不少意見。這許多意見，都是年靑人在生活的過程裏應遇到而常可決定他一生的福禍。</p>
<p>內容方面，除了如題名所表示的免關於性心理的外，多少亦涉及其他性問題的各枝節。與性生理學，性衛生學。果然仍有明確的界限可以別出。然而還是相互貫通地可以溝豁發明的。</p>
<p>本書的梗概</p>
<p>編製的體裁，一共羅列爲八章，四十三節，外序一篇，又加上譯者的序文一則，附錄二則（內　氏傳略未刊）。形式和脈絡是淸晰的。第一章諸論，講述作者對於「性」這間題的總　的見解，硏究的動機。第二章是「性的生物學」，是從生理的本體爲　而出發，釋明其移遞到精神的過程，而更詳細地分節論及「性擇」及「性擇」的各因素。以下一章是「靑年期的性衝動」，講到愛的初度呈現時所採採的對付，說出種種岐途的慼予更改後，作者提出了對於　年施以「性敎育」的要求。以上的三章差不多把性的常態心理己述畢。再跟着的二章是研究性的變態。愛的象徵，性的岐變，從童年到衰到的種種不正常的性舉動，更加以社會所給予的批判態度，這就是第四章的內容。從這相似的一點延展，便是關於性的逆轉，也就是「同性戀」的問題。作者在第五章裏詳細地加以解答，並且歸結到關於此項戾換現象的治療。第六章「婚姻」，是從心理的，也是社會的，去釋明這一現象的種切，頗有可以補充傳統意見之處。「戀愛的藝術」在第七章裏，是從性的觀點來說出牠的關係，認爲是人生享受的諸手段之一。末了的「結論」，分別地討論性衝動的「動性」及其「昇化」，人類文化的偉鉅累積，脫不了這向來被認爲猥穢的原力。</p>
<p>譯者的成就</p>
<p>更應推祟的是譯者，潘光且氏，本是我國優生生理派的社會學權威，他的努力于譯述本妻，很有劃時代的價値和意義。譯筆的優美旣不但是無懈可擊，且其流　熔渾處實堪令人拍節稱賞。此外有近十萬字的註釋，和從註釋中分立出的一段關于同性戀的附錄，都是把中國故有的文獻中的例範鈎出給予一種新的科學評價，使得舊文藝的無數疑徵都得到新的根據，更認爲是中國學者研究性心理學的另一原始的方式。</p>
<p>理士的原著在二十年前被外國認爲是禁書。可幸的是中國現在也沒有熱心者出來「衛道」而指爲不雅。類似本書的雖早就有過譯或著，不過都是未曾流傳廣的。這書的另一譯本田馮明章譯出，題爲「性心理」，已出版六次。但論比較，則除了註釋及筆調有不及之處，而且馮著關於理論方面刪削得太多。附帶地在這裏提起，但是對於兩位介紹者所賜予我們這社會的功績，都値得頌美。</p>
<p>至於本書的唯一缺點，或可說是作者還不能擺脫盡他的道學氣味。這位老人在本書的各處常鼓吹他中庸的道德觀。然而雖如此，雖另有許多我們不能同意的所在，仍舊不足以減損本書的價值。牠縱然不致於會成爲敎科用的模本，可是流傳在青年間。以及因流傳得廣而散佈着新風氣的養成，和其對於社會的精神觀點的貢獻，仍是不可限度的。</p>

<h3>慧慧</h3>
<p>— 石默</p>
<p>三十三年的五月，敵人攻時長沙，登匆匆的帶了他的一個女同學回到鄉下，因爲這女同學的家已先長沙而失守了。登家裏的人呌她做「楊小姐」。但登呌他的女同學做「慧慧」，慧慧長得相當美麗，年紀看去大槪是十九歲，不過登說她只有一十八歲，兩根柔長的辮子，垂在肩上，一對大而烏黑的眼珠，毫不害羞的看人。來的第一天，登的全家都爲之驚異了，到第二天，登家的隣居發現來了這麼一位女郎，也驚異了，到第三四天，淤近的市鎮都驚異起來。</p>
<p>人們過見了就交換相同的意見說：「這位楊小姐却跟着登到他家裏來了？這是兵荒馬亂的時候，兵荒馬亂的時候，年青的人……不過，」說到這裏，大家都不免要同時的說：「楊小姐倒十分標緻的，漂亮得很。」</p>
<p>登的父親對於慧慧之來，看見甚麽事情都是登親目照料，十分殷勤，也搖着頭說：「這年頭，還戀甚麽的愛？」</p>
<p>但是不久，敵人越過長沙打衡陽去了，這鄕下離長沙不過百里，立時不安寗起來。人們忙着自己逃難的事，很少談論慧慧了，登的家裏對於慧慧，也漸漸熟悉，彷彿沒有這麽一個人，又彷彿是一家裘的人，開家庭會議討論逃難的時候，慧慧也　着登坐在桌子的旁邊。</p>
<p>討論的結果，登的家裏，全部遷移到離這市鎭十五里的山谷中去。從第二早起，登的家裏就開始遷徙了。</p>
<p>這時候的慧慧，忽然活潑起來她帮着搬這搬那，抬這抬那，和登的母親嫂嫂妹妹一起忙着，在她們覺得要請登或時男工來的時候，慧慧馬上將這件事情做好了，幷且做得又快又妥貼，這樣，登的母親覺得十分高典，一個女孩子愛做男孩子的事，對於「逃難」這是很適合的。</p>
<p>搬到山谷以後，這時登家左右已搬來了不少人家，登家是住在佃戶的兩間小茅屋裏，因爲婦人小孩子多，慧慧常在這兩間小屋裏睡不下去，登就帶着慧慧四處去打遊擊，遇有別家的女人睡時擠得不太緊的，慧慧笑嘻嘻的，就擠着睡了下去，大家嚷着：「楊小姐！楊小姐！擠不得了。」這時候，慧慧己經倒下去睡熟了。</p>
<p>但慧慧始終是不大歡喜說話的，她只微笑。高興的時候，就鼓着大的眼睛，大聲的說話，笑了起來，兩根辮子在腦後激烈的左右擺動。隔三五天，便和登及登的弟弟、帶着工人，走到家裏去搬運一次油鹽柴米，零碎什物。登的父親的酒瓶又空了，忽然嫂嫂又記起小孩子的一雙鞋子還留在家裏，慧慧他們就冒險的走十五里路到家裏去了。</p>
<p>雖然慧慧對於運輸是十分高典的，但這是幷不輕鬆的工作，小市鎭上，甚麽人都有了，而且都是有武器的人，有一次慧慧他們四人，在家裏淸理些什物，掮兩袋米回到山谷來，剛鎖好門反身要走，隊伍從市鎮上向這方開來了，他們只好俯身尋小路向深草處移動，但他們是無論如何要橫過這一條公路才能回到山谷去的。他們等等又等，隊伍太長了，等到了黃昏時候，慧慧說等不住了，要跨過公路去。看着前面一個兵走過了五六步，後面一個兵相差十來步，慧慧猛的縱身跳起，飛奔越過公路，低頭就踏進了那邊的深草裏面，把兩個兵嚇了一跳，駡了聲：「他媽的！」以後登和他弟弟及那個工人，也依法橫越過了公路，回到山谷的小屋，已是黑夜，全家都　　慧慧勇敢。</p>
<p>慧慧的兩根辮子，是她最喜愛的，在小屋子裏悶坐的時候，她就拆散開來，央求嫂嫂替她梳，　她打。相隔了一兩月，登家裏滿屋子人都已喜歡慧慧了，嫂嫂也細心的爲她時常識辮子；有時　　　　唇悶悶的坐着，登的　　也要高興的逗她。向嫂嫂　　　：「楊小姐要梳辮子了？」忽然一次搬東西回到山谷裘來，慧慧堅決的要嫂嫂替她將兩根辮子剪去。兩間小屋的人聽說楊小姐要剪辮子，都奇怪的圍了攏來。大家覺得兩根辮子剪了的好，但大家都曉得慧慧對於這兩根辮子有着很深的感情，所以雖然贊成，却同時表示十分惋惜；有的說：「楊小姐不必剪吧，這時局眼看也快要好起來了。」登從外面走進來說：「慧慧你爲甚麼一定要剪呢？」慧慧正在猶豫，聽登一說，對着登：「我爲什麼不剪，還是剪了好？還是不剪給人强姦了的好？我要剪！」嫂嫂搜着剪刀，站在慧慧的後面，聽這話羞紅了這忙壞　　：「楊小姐，那麼我勢了」。慧慧咬着牙說：「剪！」兩顆晶亮的淚珠從臉上直滾了下來，嫂嫂握着兩根辮子走出門去，慧慧倒在床上大聲的哭了。</p>
<p>原來這一天他們去家裏搬東西，被五個兵追了一陣，慧慧聽見後面說：「前面有個女的，兩根辮子，快快追上去？」慧慧路熟，逃了回來，心可跳到了口裏；所以下決心把兩根辮子剪去。以後慧慧西式頭不像西式頭，空　　　　　　，　　　人　都投以奇災的眼光，慧慧先也不大留意，後來漸漸感到不安起來。有一次登和慧慧出去，因爲天晚，又亂槍聲音甚密，沒有回到山谷。到第二早回去，說昨晚在另外一個姓李的佃戶家過夜，嫂嫂偶然的問一句，如何睡的？李佃戶僅有一床破褥子，，登說：「我們兩個人就　　一床　子裏」。旁這一個　　　　人正站在那裏，大吃一驚　：你們兩個人睡在一床　子？」登覺得這種婦人。也無法理喩的，沒有解釋，於是道話傳出去了，而且傳得十分的快。</p>
<p>附近的人們見着登和慧慧走在一起，就悄悄的交換着相同的意見說：「他們已經睡過覺了呢……不過！」說到這裏，大家都不免要同時的說：「他們還算是一對，一對佳偶」。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，慧慧住不下去了，聽到這一些話，她也面紅起來，終於慧慧吿別登的父親，隻身走了。</p>
<p>嫂嫂十分掛念慧慧，要登護送慧慧走出危險區域。</p>
<p>慧慧不久就到了重慶，聽說今年己經結婚了。</p>
<p>登送慧慧走後，十分埋怨自己，說不該在隣居那位婦人面前隨使說出那樣的話來，鄕下人不會了解年靑的人的。</p>
<p>聽到慧慧結婚的消息，登很是高興，不過逢人常總要微笑的說：「有慧慧道樣一位太太，整天也是淘氣的呢！」</p>

<h3>推薦一個獨唱會</h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>—男中音呂鑄洪敎授—</p>
<p>不論器樂　步到怎樣的程度。聲樂的償實親切之感，往往　非純粹器樂的表現，所可比擬。假使你不知欣賞夾妙的　樂，你將不知音樂的「魔力」</p>
<p>人人可以學聲樂，但只有很少的人，能够做歌唱家；因爲天賦的聲帶決定了一切。在中國，因爲一般人身體都比較虛弱，一般的說來，先天的條件，使他們發音，比西方人來得小，弱而鬆，沒有西方人那樣一結實，堅强而有力。這在平常的語言發音中，即可辨出。因此，我們可以這樣說：中國人學聲樂，更需要天才，更需要苦工。</p>
<p>中國歌唱家不多，但在最近的上海，却有很多的個人獨唱會，他（她）們的成績如何，我不敢妄說短長，但其中有不少天才，則可斷言。聽過斯義桂的男中音的，覺得很滿意，熱心的聽衆都布望他到美國以後，能有更多的進步，不讓「勞倫斯梯貝脫」專美。同時，我們希望有更多的斯義桂，更好的斯義桂。</p>
<p>這裏，我願意推薦另一位奇特的天才—男中音歌唱家呂籌洪敎授。他對聲樂己下過九年的苦工，是海上名師蘇石林的高足。很　淺地說，從他的外表來看，也許已可決定他在生理上是够了條件的；正如市府交響樂團主任許綿淸先生一樣，他那外表已是一個好的男中音的樣誌。</p>
<p>呂先生是一位「戲　男中音」。聽過他歌唱的，都稱頌他的苦量大，音色柔美。在他的技術中，各方面都表現得很豐富，無論音色，音質，表悄，都非一般貧乏的歌者所可望其項背。任何一個歌唱者，其成功大抵由於各方面表現的「豐富」，因爲能「豐富」，而後方能表現出「力」。音樂的好壞，取決於「力」。</p>
<p>唱小品歌曲容易，唱歌劇中的咏歎調（aria）則難，一個好的歌唱家對這些咏歎調，都能應付裕如，毫不吃力。呂　洪的成就也就在於音域廣闊，音量與表情豐富，即對於歌劇中最難的「巴利阿其」中咏歎曲，也不大在乎。所以，這兒的介紹，實非有意誇張的捧塲！</p>
<p>廿七，廿八兩晚，這位豐富有力的「戲劇男中音」，將在蘭心出現，除了幾個大節目如「蒙面舞會」的咏歎曲及里昂卡伐浴的「巴利阿其」外尙有最Popular民謠「伏爾加船夫曲」，中交歌曲等。我想這些精采的演唱，將使無數音樂迷，被陶醉於「聲的魔力」中。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　133</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「那麽，誰把我的地址吿訴你的呢？」</p>
<p>「青木老師」。</p>
<p>「噢…」！鶴見又有些焦躁了，「誰給靑木長老的消息」？</p>
<p>「尊駕你自己咧」！</p>
<p>「誰」？鶴見以爲聽錯了。</p>
<p>「大哥你自己」！萍子又重複了一句。</p>
<p>「胡說」！鶴見無不擇言，日出了這兩個字，當時覺得這兩個字衝口而出，利害太大，馬上想轉口，吿罪解釋，却聽得對方在電話裏發出了一種特殊的驚訝呼聲，又像怨懟，又像驚喜。這麽一來，弄得鶴見楞在那裏，一時竟不知道應當如何揩詞來解釋，而對方也好像楞住了，正在那裏咀嚼這兩個字的意味似的。</p>
<p>鶴見　口說了這兩字，平常得很，又何以值得如此　禮？殊不知道自從昨晚鶴見與萍子二人，一度在海濱月下談話之後，鶴見已經打定一個「敬」字的主意來慼付萍子的糾纏。但又非「敬而遠之」的辦法；因爲鶴見覺得萍子的才調和地位，實在可以利用，但不能與她親近，一親近就是給萍子一個戀愛襲的機會。所以最好是在他與她之間，保持一個相當的距離，這個距離當中，又築上一堵「敬」的牆垣，把言情談愛的路徑，隔絕起來。</p>
<p>可惜這們一個好「招」，費了不少心血盤算出來的，竟在這個突如其來的電話刺　之下，自己無心破壞了。「胡說」這兩個字，從一方　，太不恭敬，從另一方而看，却是太親近了，親近得同家人父子密友愛人說話的聲口一般。太不恭敬或是太親近，在鶴兌一方面都不慼該。</p>
<p>「真是失禮，萍子，……因爲一夜不曾休息，神經竟不聽話，用了這樣不應當用的字句：」！</p>
<p>「喜…？爲什麼不應該？嗯？…不過我也知道，…你認爲不該同我這們隨便，…總之，還是把我當一討厭的外人罷了…我也知道你始終不會給我一綫的機會…」聲音有些岔了，好像傷心起來了？</p>
<p>…喂…唉…萍子你…」鶴見一時想不出相當的擋詞。</p>
<p>「大哥，你很忙，別讓我把閒話躭誤了正經罷。請你用紙筆記下靑木老師呌我轉給你的幾句話…」！下沒有說話的聲音，却是用手指甲在話機上敲出的密碼。</p>
<p>鶴見一聽這密碼的方式，不禁又大吃一驚，因萍子所用的，正是鶴見發明，認爲無法索解的特殊密碼。於是趕緊用紙筆記了下來：</p>
<p>「玉兒，汝之所謀，必無結果，况已有人，先期進行；宗旨不同，目標列一。故汝當結束一切，速返大陸，千萬不必　進。目前刦象己成，難以回天，此我用周天　宮數學，推測出來，不可不信。浩然老人井上靑木，示」。</p>
<p>這密碼是鶴見的心血結晶，索隱歌句，都在肚內，一　號碼立時寫出文字。又恐號碼錯誤，當下又請萍子複敲一遍，校正無訛。</p>
<p>「萍子，我還有一個疑問，可不可以請你解釋一下？」</p>
<p>「我知道」！萍子又格格地笑了，「，你想知道靑木老師從哪專探出你的秘密來的，是不是」？</p>
<p>「猜得對，就請賜敎罷」。</p>
<p>「還是那句老話，吿訴他一切的，正是　大哥自己。」</p>
<p>「又是用的玄術」？</p>
<p>「一些也不錯。上午八時。他用我做媒介，實行了一度催眠；那時恐怕你也正在睡眠裏，所以成績很很，一點也用不着强制，你把心裏的話，都說了出來」。</p>
<h3>一個聖者一個罪人　埃利奧特的戀史</h3>
<p>— 兪晶譯</p>
<p>好萊塢在猶疑中，原因是要拍一部維多利亞女皇時代的女小說家喬治。埃利奧特（George　Eliot）歷史的影片。導演們要攝製一部關於這位名小說家的生活的片子，但是他們不能決定究竟他們應該慕寫那一個喬治。埃利奧特呢？</p>
<p>這部影片應該描寫全世界讀者，從其作品中所認識釣喬治，埃利奧特嗎？她的讀者都認爲她是當時嚴肅道德的衡護者，在她的作品裏，一樁道德的罪過就是終身莫贖的愆尤，一個人倘若犯了不正當的唆味應該以身殉之的。</p>
<p>還是這部影片應該描寫在倫敦平靜的皇家公園附近許多鄰居所知道的她的生活呢？在她的鄰居們看起來，這位著名的小說家瑪麗安。伊凡斯（Marian　Evaus）〔譯者按：這是她的本名〕是一個淫蕩的女人，沒有廉恥地公開與另一個有婦之婦同居，而住在那合法的妻子的住宅附近。</p>
<p>但是這一個奇異的女作家，並沒有顧忌到後日會有好萊塢的導演們會考慮到她雙重生活的矛盾。她堅信她自己作品中的道德觀，但是她是同樣地堅信着那個永遠無法與她結婚的男子愛情是這世界給她的唯一的快樂。</p>
<p>就像喬治桑有她的蕭邦一般，喬治·埃利奧特也有她的喬治·享利·路易斯（George　Henry　Lewes）。</p>
<p>倘使一個油滑的登徒子談論起來，瑪麗安。伊凡斯並不是一個述人的女孩子。當她墮入情網被認作當時倫敦文學界的醜事時，她巳是三十開外的人了。雖然她有着苗條而健康的身材和端荘的面龐，但是她的條件還不足被稱爲美人。因爲她常瀏覽希臘和拉丁文學，哲學和社會學的綠故，所以她大而藍綠色的眼睛有些兒近視。</p>
<p>當她與路易斯在一個共同的朋友楷普曼（Chapman）家裏相邂逅的時候，她只編慕和翻譯那些古代的典籍，還沒有想到做一個創作小說家。他們相遇不久，就發生感情，交往有二十五年的歷史，這總不是一個水性揚花引蜂惹蝶的女孩子單靠一時衝動所辦得到的。路易斯據說是有瘦纖的身材，茂密而卷曲的頭髮，　　的髭　和眉毛，未始沒有一點英俊氣懷。</p>
<p>更有一點需要提及的，路易斯的妻子常跟着好朋友出門，拋下三個孩子給他撫養。在那時喬治埃利奧特嚴肅的淸敎徒精神所蘊藏着的天性和那敏穎的小品文作家的天性融合在一起，他們彼此得到極大的益處和快樂，而淋漓盡致地發揮他們的成就到最高點。</p>
<p>這裏節錄塢　斯爾德，白蘭德所寫的著名婦女傳裏面喬治·埃利奧特傳的一段文章，描慕當時那著名的女作家怎樣藐視維多利亞時代的英國道德而愛上的那位男子，同時對喬治·埃利奧特的行爲作一種旣衛護又惋惜的評價。</p>
<p>「當路易斯三十歲的時候，他己從事批評，小說，傳記，戲劇，和哲學的硏究，他曾在國外遨遊，因之他的人類大性的經騐十分　　。他也會站在講台上對着羣衆演說，他也會從事艱苦而有興味的籲報工作。據說他還會在流動劇團專擔任小丑的角色。</p>
<p>「因爲他生性活潑，談吐豪放，因此他的熱情，荒誕，和縱恣的談話和能度，時而引起朋友們的興趣，時而引起朋友們的驚異。」</p>
<p>「當喬治，埃利奧特碰到道個男子之後，她心中起了不平凡的波瀾。她覺得這個男子與她年輕時代　居在瓦魏克郡（Ｗarwickshire）以及她所長成大的修道院時所見的男子絕對不同。她意識到危機臨到她的生活之中。她必須私自下一個決定來指導她的行爲，道並不是依據當時英國的道總標準而是依照個人內心信念的諧稱。」</p>
<p>「大概是路易斯先生曾寫了一封信給她，解釋他的處境，並且竭力勸說伊凡斯小姐做他的終身侶伴。後來，她慼允了，因爲她認爲並沒有侵害了他人的權利。她就成了他的妻子，但是不能成爲合法的妻子，因爲他不能與</p>
<p>「這就引起她的朋友間極大的驚愕。譬如說：白雷太太和其姊妹過後瞭解了她的良心仍是那麽完美，纔逐漸地恢復了她們間親蜜的友情。」‘</p>
<p>「喬治，埃利奧特旣是那麽一個極端敏感的女子，這樁事一定特別使她感受到痛苦的磨難。她沒有意識到她的行爲是錯誤的。她從所愛的男子那兒得到完美的精神的友誼。但是她採取這般大胆的步驟使許多戚族與她之間有了很深的裂痕，這足以擾累她那勇敢的天性。她的友伴們對於她的嚴肅是很敬畏的，但是她爲了愛情　絕了道德，引起友伴們大大的驚慌，就像蒼窮落下來似的震恐。」</p>
<p>當她自稱爲「路易斯太太」的時候，這已算是她沒有合法批準而改名字的第三次了。他的教名是瑪麗安（Mary　Ann）她自己改爲瑪麗安（Marian）據說因爲後者更娟麗一點。</p>
<p>她那男性的筆名喬治，埃利奧特大槪是爲了不但要　藏她的眞名而且避免被發覺她和路易斯的噯味事蹟。但是這種願望到了她的成名作亞當。皮德（Adam　Bede）印子之後就被打破了。</p>
<p>在一八五八年麥克阿瑟先生在她的傳記裏說：「每例人都在猜想，但是大都猜錯了。因爲大家都注意在喬治，埃利喬特的一部教會生活素描的書上。」</p>
<p>麥克阿　先生所寫的她的傳記裏說：「當時只有查理，狄更士（Charles　Dickeno）用手指針對着這私密的綫索說：如果這二卷小說不是一個女子寫的話，我願意自己承認是一個女子！」</p>
<p>一年之後，這個秘密揭穿了。那就是亞當。皮德的出版，嘗首題詞寫：「給我親愛的丈夫，喬治·亨利·路易斯。」</p>
<p>那些題辭上說：「獻給我親愛的丈夫，喬治，亨利，路易斯，倘若不是他的愛情賦予我的生命以快樂的話，我絕不能寫成這些稿子的。瑪麗安，路易斯。」（譯自雜誌文摘）</p>

<p>米萊士（E．Millais　1829-1896）是英國十九世紀人物畫家中的出色人才，與羅塞諦齊名，算是辣麥耳前派的一員。他那高尚的性格和詩的裝飾的氣分都表現在他的畫面上。這張畫原名Mercy-Saint　Bartholomew's　day，是描寫法國宗教革命時某一個大屠殺的場面，情　逼真，　圖緊湊，可謂辣萎耳前派的代表作。（獅）</p>

<h3>糖與舞</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>沙利文糖果公司的一個女女職員業我說：</p>
<p>聖讓前一日（廿四日），一個下午單是巧格力糖一項就買出一千七百多萬元。許多顧客候在櫃台前，工廠方面一送到，還沒有拆開，便被一搶面光了。工廠出產來不及，否則還要多賣一點。</p>
<p>她吿訴我這段話，我一點也不驚奇，我冷冷地問她：巧格力糖賣多少錢一磅，她說一萬元。我說，不過一千七百幾十磅，那有什麽希奇？</p>
<p>的確，上海灘喫得起一萬元一磅巧格力糖的人太多了，又何祇這一千七百多人呢？</p>
<p>以小喩大，今年這個聖誕節，其它方面的消耗，正不知幾何！</p>
<p>然而，市塲還是不景氣的。聖　之夜，十時光景，曾經隨幾個朋友到某大舞塲去觀光，座上客寥寥，樂師雖然很起勁的吹奏，但那股蕭索氣氛，畢竟無法驅散，舞女見到客人便說：生意不好啊！這情景與去年今日一比，真是不堪回首了。</p>
<p>上面這兩個例子，可以說是矛盾中的統一，充分說明了上海這個社會的經濟上的混亂性。孟老夫子說：食色性也。　還是佔第一位，如果從表而上看，上海人寗可喫到糖，能不能跳到舞，那是在其次了。以經濟而論，一磅巧格力可以　府大小人等一律　到，而無塲片刻之歡，所費決不止一萬元，且僅樂及一人。</p>
<p>但這也不能用作目前經濟現狀的解釋的。</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織19</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>賣藝求乞（上）</p>
<p>本埠硬採丐幫中，他們流行着的乞討方式，仍舊是奉行着江湖上的傳統。　派別爲十八個種類。稱爲「江湖十八　」。茲列舉並說明如下：—</p>
<p>（一）「唱這情」—這是一種文縐縐的歌唱丐幫，包括唱「運花落」的在內。其用具分「三木」和「皮筒」爾種。三木是唱「運花落」用的，其固定的唱詞包羅萬象，乞丐走到每一行業的商店門口，便得唱該行業的詞句。而且須切合得體，不得以張冠李戴來敷衍。如果店家不給他錢，他還在詞句巾調侃幾句，甚至作惡刻的　馬。店家也奈何他不得。「皮筒」就是唱道情用的。算是斯文階級，要着長衫，以表示其階級不同恒流。給他錢不用手拿，却用筒板夾入筒內。這是幫中的規矩。唱詞確是道情調，取材亦係古人事蹟。店家逢到唱道情的乞丐，都樂於佈施。因爲此輩身面齊整，不討人厭。但要會唱詞便須識字通文。且須隨機應變，識字不多者便不够資格充任了。</p>
<p>（二）「呑劍彈」—本派又稱「傢裏手　」。其行徑和「山東人變　法，要錢不要命」相仿。他們是以呑劍和吞鐵彈嚇人的。呑劍切口稱「長條」，呑彈稱「含團」。此派乞丐上門，統叫：「老板求討一個」。不說其他的話。給錢便走，不給便用二尺來長的刀，威核桃般的鐵彈，向唯嚨裏直　進去。於是眼淚　涕，一齊擁出。非給他更多的錢是不肯跑的了。</p>
<p>（三）「軟硬武」—此幫分爲　硬二派系。「軟武」丐隨身帶着小型的十八般武器，用　槍在天靈蓋上直豎着。「硬武」丐却不帶傢伙，走到店户住家，不論任何物件，都可以拿來頂在鼻尖上。、不使他落地，十幾斤的大門閂，極鋒利的大肉斧，都能頂得住。這倒仗着眞才實藝的玩意兒，非軟武所可比擬。</p>
<p>（四）「水花碗」—道是類似江湖班的技術表演，計分爲「大花」「小花」二派。「大花」用兩大碗水，用繩結住。左右開弓，盤旋而成　形。須水不下注方算眞工夫。「小花」是用一隻碗將糊結住，　端有一個鈎子，將鈎種入在手臂上，擎住了一碗水。手臂上鮮血淋漓，惹得人怪可憐地給他錢。實則臂上早已　成一個小洞眼，和女人耳朶　耳環的一樣的洞。出門的時候，擦上了些猪血，便和新剌入的一般了。這可以說是「人造自來血」，騙騙路人罷了。</p>
<p>（五）「眞假狗」—此派携狗出門乞錢，稱狗爲「條」。在丐幫中，倒算是老大哥的身份。不是後生小丐所可濫芋充數的。他們靠狗吃飯，稱狗爲「木錢」。衆養得馴服之後，方可上街應市。叫跑就跑，叫跳就跳。以博徉店家住宅中人的開心。此外還有一種乞丐，套着狗頭求乞，口裏還唱着狗吠聲的歌曲：—</p>
<p>「汪汪有財香！</p>
<p>嗡嗡嗡狗來富！</p>
<p>老闆給錢養　玀。」</p>
<p>此輩居然自願化身爲狗，，以求金錢。行熊殊俗不可耐。幫中稱爲「裝跳」無異衣冠禽獸也。</p>

<h3>何謂「秋石」　國醫的解釋</h3>
<p>二十一日見本報「偸小便製秘藥」一文，談及製「秋石」方面，殊覺不詳，茲時補充之。</p>
<p>查我國醫藥，以人之小便製成藥劑，共有三種：（一）小便。（二）溺白　。（三）即「秋石」。</p>
<p>小便方家稱之輪廻酒或還元湯，方書所載其治病功效極多，實則用之治跌打損傷，確有奇效，其他所云，未免言過其實。</p>
<p>溺白　藥名人中白，中醫喉科用爲要藥，並洽消渴，但內服方中醫家鮮有用之者。</p>
<p>至於秋石之名，實係假借，古之方士煉丹之精華，因其色白而堅，名之曰「秋石」。故淮南子曰：「丹成號曰秋石」</p>
<p>至於小便製成之結晶，形狀顏色與方士煉成者相同彷彿，所以亦名「秋石」。小便如何製成秋石？以明代李時珍本草綱目言之極詳，茲記之於下：</p>
<p>「秋石須秋月取童子溺，每缸入石膏末七錢，桑條　澄定。傾去淸液，如此二三次，乃入秋露水一桶攪澄：如此數次，滓穢滌盡，鹹味减除，以重紙鋪灰上晒乾，完全取起輕淸在上者爲「秋石」。重濁在下者括去，，古人立名實本此義。男用童女溺，女用童男溺。」像這樣的製治，方才可稱道地。除此外有若干奸商粗製濫造，取巧的製法：</p>
<p>「……世醫不取秋時，雜收人溺，但以皂莢水澄晒煉，煆爲陽煉，盡失於道，何合於名！媒利敗人，安能應病？」像這種劣品同樣的僞造的還有把人中白改製而成的，服食之有害無益，更屬意中之事。</p>
<p>本品的功效在本草綱目上說：「主治虛勞冷疾，小便遺數，漏精白濁，滋腎水，養丹田，返本還元，歸根復命，安五臟，潤三焦，消痰欬，退骨蒸，軟堅硬塊，明目清心……」（但醫者用者絕少。）</p>
<p>普通腫脹病人忌食鹽，所以也有用秋石代鹽煮菜給病人作菜的，若以本品爲延年益壽之仙丹，則愚莫甚矣！</p>
<p>在各大國藥號內，一二千元即可買得一二錢大小的一塊，其形狀頗像冰糖。好事諸君，何不賢一塊見識見識，如有醫學家或化學家硏究其成份藥效，省得我人多所猜疑矣！（李仁衆）</p>
<h3>建議</h3>
<p>— 肖頑</p>
<p>黃浦分局前面臨金陵東路有一塊很大的空地。這裏地處中區，風水頗佳，假如市府和警局允許攤販在這裏擺攤，不是眞的給他們一個有力的援助嗎？這樣一來，一方面表示當局所給予攤販的辦法嗎？一方面更可顯示攤販和警察言歸於好，大家都笑嘻嘻的，積忿全消，和氣生財！</p>
<p>不過，聲明一下：余非攤販也。</p>
<h3>這是舊金山沿海全景</h3>
<p>（一）爲安琪兒烏，（二）爲愛爾卡脫利島，那兒有聯邦反省院，（三）軍用船塢所在地，（四）軍隊駐屯地。這一塊壯麗的土地，曾被認爲最好的聯合國會址。</p>
<h3>外次甘乃光</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>「打倒列强，打倒列强，除軍閥，除軍閥，國民革命成功，國民革命成功，　歡唱，齊歡唱。」</p>
<p>這一首婦孺皆知的國民革命歌的作者，就是現任外交部政務次長的甘乃光先生，並且是在民國十四年，中央黨部在廣州開黨員大會會前怱怱擬成，從這一點，可以窺見他的才智了。</p>
<p>甘氏曾任黃埔軍官學校政治敎官，不但搜畏詞令，文字也流利可誦。過去深得先烈慼仲凱先生的信任。先生今年適爲五十歲，廣西岑溪縣人，廣州私立嶺南大學畢業生，畢業後會任該校經濟學敎授，著有「先秦經濟思想史」，「中國國民黨幾個根本問題」，譯品有「英國政黨史」，「美術攝影大綱」等書。他的才學，堪稱廣博。此外，更著述有關黨養的小册多種，因又有「三民主義理論家」之號，當時風頭之健，竟超過「老牌」理論家戴季陶等人。</p>
<p>他　好攝影和吟咏新詩，前者的造詣，巳可以躋居專家之列。</p>
<p>今年夏天，他被派充我國出席慶祝菲律寶獨立典禮專使。他近來有蒐集郵票的嗜好。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Successfully Concludes; The Constitution of the Republic of China is Born; To Be Implemented on December 25th of Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The National Assembly, which opened on November 15th, has lasted forty days. Aside from the preparatory meetings and review committees, the assembly held a total of twenty sessions. The constitutional draft has completed its one hundred and thirteen proceedings. This constitution, possessing unique characteristics and democratic features, was finally born in an atmosphere of reconciliation among all parties and factions. The 25th is a historical commemorative day, as the assembly completed its mission today. The closing ceremony was held at 3:40 PM. All representatives of the National Assembly and envoys from various countries attended. The hall was brightly lit by mercury lamps, and the air was harmoniously warm, as if celebrating a joyous event. Wu Jingheng served as the chairman of the assembly. Wu entered from the side door of the presidium office, followed by Chairman Chiang. Wu wore a blue gown and a black jacket, with a bald white head. Chairman Chiang wore a military uniform with collar badges and a Blue Sky White Sun Medal. They ascended the stage amidst music. Wu sat on the left, while Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government, sat on the right. After the ceremony began and formalities were observed, Wu delivered a speech (text of the speech follows). Chairman Chiang sat in a chair on the left of the stage, displaying a joyful expression, quietly listening to Wu's speech. After the speech, Secretary-General Hong announced the message from the assembly to the Chairman of the National Government. (Original text is in another article.) The assembly then held a presentation ceremony. Secretary-General Hong, wearing a swallow-tailed formal suit, and Wu Dingchang, Chief Secretary of the National Government, ascended the stage together. Hong presented the message and a finely bound Constitution of the Republic of China to Chairman Wu Jingheng, who solemnly presented it to Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang accepted it with a smile and then handed it to Chief Secretary Wu at 3:53 PM. Music rose again, and everyone stood up and applauded. Chairman Chiang then delivered a speech (text of the speech follows). Chairman Chiang's speech lasted for three minutes, and the audience applauded enthusiastically seven times. After the Chairman finished speaking, everyone stood up, raised their arms, and shouted: "Long live the Republic of China!" The cheers were thunderous and lasted for a long time. This constitutional National Assembly finally closed amidst cheers of "Long live!"</p>
<h3>The Chairman Accepts the Constitution and Addresses the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Chairman Chiang of the National Government delivered a speech at the closing ceremony of the National Assembly on the 25th. The original text is as follows: Today, the National Assembly has formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China and resolved the date of implementation of the Constitution and the preparatory procedures. I, Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the National Government, respectfully accept this. As Chairman Wu has just said, the formulation of this Constitution is enough to comfort the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves under the leadership of our Founding Father for 52 years, as well as the heroic souls of the soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance. The National Government will certainly follow the procedures decided by the Assembly and implement them one by one. I sincerely hope that all of our representatives will assist the National Government in leading the national people to jointly uphold and implement this Constitution, so that our China will become a new China of the Three Principles of the People, by the people, governed by the people, and for the people. From today onwards, the National Government has fulfilled its long-cherished wish of returning power to the people. Representatives, you have created the foundation for constitutional governance in China, which is truly worthy of the celebration of all compatriots. I, Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the government, congratulate the success of the Assembly and wish all representatives and compatriots of the country health and happiness.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The message from the National Assembly to the government presenting the Constitution is as follows: On November 28th, at the third plenary session, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally presented the revised draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China to the Assembly, which was received by the Assembly. Subsequently, the Assembly continued to hold sessions, entrusting the review committees with the original draft and the amendments proposed by the attending representatives for review. The review results were then reported to the Assembly and adopted separately. In accordance with the Assembly's rules of procedure, a total of twenty sessions were held, completing the first, second, and third readings. The entire text was revised and passed, and the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution were decided, and the date of promulgation was determined. It was also resolved that the Constitution of the Republic of China would be implemented on December 25th, 1947. Now, we respectfully present the original copy of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution to the government for promulgation and implementation on time. The Assembly is awed by this extraordinary undertaking and expresses its sincere hope to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Presidium of the National Assembly will hold its final meeting in one or two days to conclude all matters.</p>
<h3>Closing Remarks by Wu Jingheng</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] During the closing ceremony of the National Assembly, Chairman Wu Jingheng delivered a speech. The full text is as follows: "Fellow Representatives, when this Assembly convened, I said that it was the most memorable and joyful day for our Republic of China, because holding a National Assembly was the most hopeful thing our Founding Father never forgot. Holding the National Assembly will surely produce a complete constitution for the Republic of China, handing over the political power of the Republic of China he built to the Chinese people. Based on a complete constitution, the Republic of China can be permanently established as a prosperous and healthy country in the world. Indeed, once the meeting began, the Chairman of the National Government handed over a carefully considered and complete constitutional draft to the Assembly. The representatives of this Assembly carefully discussed it for more than a month and produced a very progressive constitution, a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People, by the people, governed by the people, and for the people, the newest constitution in the world. The spirit of the Founding Father in heaven must be very happy. The Founding Father contributed the Three Principles of the People to his compatriots, asking them to use it as a foundation to create the most complete and democratic constitution, and he has achieved his aspiration. He greatly agreed with Confucius's principle of 'yielding for the sake of the country' and also agreed with Lao Tzu's 'acting without dominating.' He could immediately yield to others after serving as interim president, and 'act without possessing.' He had the best doctrine but did not favor his own party. He wrote the Outline of National Reconstruction early on, hoping to convene the National Assembly and return power to the people. Therefore, the representatives of this Assembly also unanimously respected the Founding Father's actions and were able to fully embrace yielding. Regarding the aspect of 'propriety,' discussions were unwilling to be ambiguous and even involved loud debates. Regarding the aspect of 'yielding,' once a majority decision was made, they immediately calmed down and did not argue. This is exactly the same as the most progressive parliamentary representatives in various countries, so they were able to produce today's most complete and democratic new Constitution of the Republic of China. Now, this first Assembly can serve as a model for future assemblies. Failing to achieve personal aspirations is a small matter, but setting a model is a big matter, so we can admire the magnanimity of these representatives. Now, let us present this constitution to the Chairman of the National Government and ask him to choose an auspicious day to promulgate it and legally hand it over to a popularly elected government for implementation, so that our Republic of China will forever become a strong and healthy country in the world. Today, we representatives dare not claim old age. We are honored to have been able to convene this meeting. We thank all the citizens for their hidden support behind the Assembly, which enabled us to achieve this success. We take this opportunity to wish our four hundred and fifty million compatriots health, peace, happiness, and longevity."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Information Hosts Reporters; Wang Chonghui Discusses the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 12:00 noon on the 25th. Dr. Wang Chonghui gave an impromptu written statement on the main points of the Constitution, stating: The Constitution formulated by the National Assembly has been prepared for more than ten years. After the promulgation of the May 5th Draft Constitution, the constitutional work had to be delayed until after the victory due to the urgency of the War of Resistance. At the beginning of this year, the Political Consultative Conference was held, with representatives from various parties and prominent figures from society participating, and several principles for revising the May 5th Draft Constitution were agreed upon. The constitutional draft submitted by the government to the National Assembly this time was revised based on the principles of revision agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference. Although the National Assembly made additions and deletions, the main points agreed upon in the political consultation were all included in the Constitution.</p>
<h3>The Kuomintang Will Hold a Party Caucus Review Meeting</h3>
<p>To be held for two days starting on the 27th</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Because party affairs personnel from various provinces came to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly, now that the Assembly has concluded, the Kuomintang has decided to convene a party caucus review meeting, scheduled to be held on the 27th for two days. It is reported that in addition to reviewing party affairs work, discussions will also be held on party affairs work after the new Constitution is announced.</p>
<h3>The Third Reading of the Constitutional Draft Has Been Completed; A Small Number of Representatives Still Oppose Officials Serving as National Assembly Representatives; Order Was Restored After Instructions from Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The 20th session of the National Assembly was held at 10:00 AM on the 25th, with 1,485 representatives, including Chiang Kai-shek, present. At the beginning of the meeting, there were 1,376 people. Chairman Yu Youren, after the secretary reported the minutes of the 19th meeting, Hu Shi stepped onto the podium amidst booing to report on the work of the drafting committee for the constitutional amendment. After Hu's speech, he stepped down amidst booing. At 10:20 AM, the third reading began. Chairman Yu passed each article amidst applause from the audience. Regarding the provisions of Article 26 concerning the election of National Assembly representatives, a representative raised the issue of the election of free professional groups. Deputy Secretary-General Lei replied: The "professional groups" in Item 6 of that article include free professional groups, and the Comprehensive Review Committee has a record of this. As for Article 28, the issue of whether officials can be elected as National Assembly representatives in Item 3 caused a great uproar. As soon as Chairman Yu finished reading that item, Ni Bi vehemently stated from the gallery: "This provision violates democratic principles and cannot be passed. We cannot be traitors to the Founding Father, nor can we be sinners for all eternity." Respondents rose up and shouted: "Down with corrupt officials!" "Down with bureaucracy!" and demanded a vote. Yu ignored this and continued reading the following articles, causing great chaos. The crowd rebuked the chairman for violating the law and demanded that the article be put to a vote. Yu then said that the third reading only revised the wording and could not make changes to the principles. The crowd roared! "According to Article 12 of the National Assembly Organization Law, the provisions of the constitutional law require the passage of three-quarters of the attending representatives to be valid." Yu then consulted with the two secretaries-general, Hong and Lei, and Lei read Articles 37 and 38 of the rules of procedure, stating: "The third reading meeting may only make corrections in wording and may not make motions for amendments unless it is discovered that the proposals are mutually contradictory. Moreover, the third reading meeting only decides on the proposal as a whole and cannot make any changes." Part of the crowd applauded in support, but the opposition was still unconvinced, shouting: "We don't want to change anything, we just demand a legal vote. Constitutional drafting is not a child's play, down with bureaucracy!" For a time, the situation became deadlocked.</p>
<p>At 10:40 AM, Representative Chiang Kai-shek, dressed in a green military uniform, stepped onto the podium and said: "Representatives, you are here to attend the meeting on behalf of the people of the whole country and should abide by the rules of the meeting and set an example for the people of the whole country. The relevant provisions of the rules of procedure have already been announced and explained very clearly by the Secretary-General, and the third reading work should be carried out in an orderly manner." After Chiang's speech, he stepped down and sat down amidst great applause. However, a few representatives still shouted: "Please vote according to the law." Chiang then stepped onto the stage again and said: "If you representatives continue to demand a vote and the result violates the rules of procedure, you will be responsible." The raging tide gradually subsided. The work of reading the Constitution continued. At 10:45 AM, Deputy Secretary Lei, on behalf of Chairman Yu, continued the reading from Chapter 5. In addition to stating in Article 64 that the provisions for the election of legislators in Item 6, "professional groups," include free professional groups, and the Comprehensive Review Committee has a record of this, and submitting the proposed wording revisions for Articles "78," "108," "111," and "146" by the representatives to the group for consolidation, all of them were read through smoothly. At 11:37 AM, Article 175 was read for the third time, and it was completed. The audience applauded for a full minute.</p>
<p>Then Hu Shi reported again amidst booing, the results of the group's consolidation. After Hu's speech, he stepped down amidst booing. The deputy secretary reported that the word "thirty-seven" was missing at the end of Item 1 of Article 177, and after the audience questioned the word "resolution" in Article 70, the original word "proposal" was maintained. At 11:45 AM, Chairman Yu said, "Those who support the Constitution of the Republic of China, please stand up." The entire audience stood up silently in response, the mercury lamps shone brightly, and the cameras whirred. All the representatives applauded and cheered "Long Live" before sitting down.

<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>[This City News] The Chinese Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement on the 24th, stating: On the 24th of this month, the party received a letter from the Democratic League regarding the party's withdrawal from the League. The public statement is as follows:</p>
<p>On August 29th of this year, the party sent a letter to the Democratic League requesting that "the Democratic League must obtain the party's consent in advance for important statements." Logically, this letter does not include that the party's important measures must obtain the Democratic League's consent in advance. The Democratic League is a broad alliance striving for democracy in response to the demands of the times. The party was originally one of the initiators. Since merging with the overseas Democratic Constitutional Party and reorganizing into the Democratic Socialist Party, in order to express the party's position, the party made the statement to the Democratic League on August 29th. The reason for participating in the National Assembly this time was to complete the Constitution, so it is hoped that constitutionalism will replace tutelage, which is a step forward compared to remaining in the stage of dictatorship. The party has no military force and no territory. How can the party disregard approaching the road to democracy? The party colleagues were moved by the voices of the majority of the people who were reduced to bankruptcy and suffered the ravages of war and asked themselves if they were innocent. Now, the party has received a letter from the Democratic League stating: "It is difficult to continue cooperating within the League." The party has its own doctrine and its own political program. It is better to be independent than to cause disputes due to entanglement. As for the advocacy of striving for peace, realizing democracy, and nationalizing the army, the colleagues have already revealed it, and they should strive to implement it later. All those who share the same goals as the party can cooperate. As for party members who participate in the Democratic League, the party will handle them in accordance with the party's constitution under these circumstances.</p>

<h3>Communist Army Launches Offensive in North China, Fierce Fighting Erupts in Suburbs of Baoding, Decision to Intensify Pacification of Restless Areas Around Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin dispatch, 25th] According to reliable information, the Communist army has decided to launch a full-scale offensive in North China in response to the successful conclusion of the National Assembly. Frequent troop movements by the Communist army have been reported in various locations, and war is expected to spread soon. Relevant authorities have stated that the National Army is well-prepared and that this Communist conspiracy may be quickly contained.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch, 25th] After suffering setbacks northwest of Baoding, the Communist army's momentum has not waned. National Army forces ten li from Mancheng have retreated to twenty li west of Baoding. However, as long as Mancheng remains in Communist hands, Baoding will remain insecure. Therefore, the city will continue to be a contested area between the two armies. Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, and even Wangdu in the south of Baoding are once again under Communist control. However, the National Army in Wangdu is awaiting supplies from Baoding, so large armies with supplies have been passing through this area. Trial runs have been conducted on the Beiping-Baoding section of the railway today, and the situation is generally good. However, the Communist army has already amassed a large force on both sides of the railway between Caohe and Xushui, so future traffic will be difficult. More than ten thousand Communist soldiers, mixed with militiamen, have also arrived west of Zhuoxian County. The Communist army's re-concentration of forces in the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway seems to be due to the National Army's thin troop strength.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 25th] The Communist 8th Field Brigade and the 70th and 82nd Regiments of Meng Qingba's troops launched a fierce attack on the northern and southern Da Ran, eastern and western Shi Qiao, fifteen li outside Baoding city, and Gong, thirty li south of the city, at 2:00 AM on the 24th. Fierce fighting continues as of the morning of the 25th. Furthermore, the Communist 11th Field Brigade has fled from Mancheng to the area around Yao Village, north of Caohe, and shelled National Army positions between Xushui and Caohetou on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch, 25th] The area around Beiping is unsettled. Lu 　, on the banks of the Sun River in Beiyuan, was captured again by more than a thousand Communist soldiers last night. The military has dispatched troops to intercept them. One thousand Communist soldiers arrived in Yipianshi in the Western Hills yesterday. After the recovery of Panggezhuang and Lixian Town in southern Beiping, small groups of Communist soldiers have been active in the vicinity again yesterday and today. The Beiping Garrison Headquarters convened a meeting of all parties yesterday to discuss solutions and decided to divide the surrounding suburbs of Beiping into five security zones, each to be the responsibility of the nearest garrison, while jointly with the Beiping Pacification Zone, intensify pacification efforts.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch, 25th] The National Army's mopping-up operation in the eastern Ninglu area of northeastern Hebei has been completed. More than four thousand Communist soldiers have dispersed, fleeing through gaps in the absolutely dominant fan-shaped formation as the National Army advances toward the coast. Part of them fled west of the road. The Bohai River coastal area in eastern Hebei, which has long been controlled by the Communist army, is now under the protection of the National Army.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Fails to Take It Despite Repeated Attacks; Situation in Liaocheng, Shandong Becomes Stable; Military and Civilians Resist Hardships, Turning Danger Into Safety</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan dispatch, 24th] Liaocheng, the most prominent stronghold outside Jinan, has recently been fiercely besieged by the Communist army again. The city used to be Dongchangfu City, where the Tuhai River and the Grand Canal intersect, forming the city's natural moat. The National Army has been trapped there for years, and the Communist army has never succeeded in taking it. Since the 20th of this month, the Communist army has taken advantage of the cold weather and frozen water to gather its elite troops, along with many cannons, and launched a fierce attack on the city for three days and nights, first coercing the civilians. They set up numerous cloud ladders and attempted to climb the city walls by wading through the water more than ten times. The military and civilians inside the city, under the leadership of Commissioner Wang Jinxiang, fought bravely, and the city remains safe. As of the evening of the 23rd, the Communist army was still concentrating its artillery fire on the east gate, constantly bombarding it. By 10:00 PM, more than a zhang had been destroyed, creating two gaps. The Communist army then swarmed forward, and the National Army bravely resisted with "human bombs". The sounds of crying and pleas for help within the city increased in intensity along with the city's peril.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan dispatch, 25th] Starting last night, the Communist army besieging Liaocheng, under the cover of three mortars and one field gun, continued to launch a fierce attack on the city walls. Tens of thousands of military and civilians inside the city, through thorough cooperation, braved the rain of bullets to repair the gaps in the east gate and repelled the Communist army in one fell swoop. There was heavy snow all day on the 25th, and the situation has stabilized somewhat.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Retreats From Suqian Outskirts; National Army Recaptures Yaowan</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou dispatch, 25th] More than 50,000 Communist soldiers have been fiercely attacking the outskirts of Suqian and the vicinity of Zaohe and Yaowan in recent days, but they began to retreat on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang dispatch, 25th] (1) The recapture of Yaowan has been confirmed. The National Army is clearing out the remaining Communist soldiers within the Pisu Sui territory south of the Longhai Railway. It is reported that there are still three regiments of Communist soldiers within the territory of Guanyun County, but their morale has been lost. (2) The Communist army in Funing is embroiled in severe internal strife and is unable to fight, and it appears to be retreating. Funing may see the light of day again within the Gregorian calendar year.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Completion of the Constitutional Task</h3>
<p>The National Assembly, convened specifically to draft the Constitution of the Republic of China, passed the entire draft Constitution yesterday and declared its closing, thus completing this grand constitutional task. This is an unprecedented event in our nation's history. Now that the Constitution of the Republic of China has been drafted, the methods for its implementation have also been clearly defined, and the National Assembly, before its closing, determined that the effective date of the Constitution will be December 25th of next year. This means that the start of constitutional government has a fixed date, which is truly comforting to the general public. The entire nation is deeply moved by the hard work of all the attending representatives of the National Assembly over these forty-plus days. As the National Assembly closes and the Constitution of the Republic of China is drafted, we would like to express the general gratitude of the Chinese people to all the representatives.</p>
<p>The drafting of this Constitution is a manifestation of the public will of the Chinese people. The representatives of the National Assembly came from all levels of society across the country and truly represent the best cross-section of national public opinion. The Constitution passed by the combined efforts of more than 1,400 representatives over forty-one days, after heated debate and careful consideration, is truly a national law that has exhausted all wisdom and is workable. The political system and other provisions stipulated therein accommodate opinions from all sides and are particularly able to express a spirit of neutrality and harmony, leaving a lasting brilliance for the National Assembly that drafted this Constitution. A nation's constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and when it is drafted, it must solicit opinions from all parties and be publicly recognized by all parties. Only when it can be publicly recognized by all parties can it be the great law of the country. This was the case with the drafting of the U.S. Federal Constitution in the past, and the situation was the same with the constitutional drafting in France after the war this time. Our country's drafting of this Constitution follows the established practices of the two advanced democratic countries, the United States and France, and establishes the foundation of our country's democratic politics. This is truly a landmark turning point in Chinese politics.</p>
<p>When talking about drafting a constitution, the constitution itself is not just a few articles, but a living, vibrant creation. The drafting of the constitution can only be said to be the birth of the constitution, like a newborn baby, it still needs to develop to maturity. The birth of a baby is painful, and life is born out of pain, but even more difficult than birth is the subsequent nurturing to adulthood. Now that the Constitution has been born, we should take even more care to nurture this baby that was born out of pain. The birth of our Constitution coincides with the festival of Christmas, the birth of Jesus, which seems to be more than just a coincidence. Jesus is the savior of mankind, and this Chinese Constitution, which was born out of pain, should at least be able to save our China in the same way. Christmas is also our National Renaissance Day, and the fact that the Constitution of the Republic of China drafted by the National Assembly was completed on this day is truly a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation. May the people of the whole country cherish our Constitution and make the country permanently stable and secure from now on!</p>
<h3>Gold Rush</h3>
<p>As a result of the Central Bank's continuous sale of gold, gold prices have finally plummeted. In two days, the price fell from the 4 million yuan level to 3.2 million yuan, a difference of about 800,000 yuan. Other US dollars, stocks, cigarettes, gauze, silk, etc. also fell in tandem. Several small-scale gold shops, money houses, and banks were caught off guard and even experienced instability. Interest rates rose to more than two jiao, and the market was in a state of panic and fear. From this point, we can get a proof for the following things:</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank does have the ability to influence gold prices.</p>
<p>(2) Fluctuations in gold prices are indeed related to commodity prices, especially stimulating for speculative goods.</p>
<p>(3) There are indeed many financial, securities, and ordinary businesses engaged in speculative activities.</p>
<p>(4) The foundation of some small-scale financial businesses is particularly unstable.</p>
<p>(5) Tightening of credit will affect interbank lending rates.</p>
<p>(6) The tightening or easing of credit is indeed in the hands of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Because there is the above series of facts, interrelated, so associate to the following three things:</p>
<p>The impact of the rise and fall of gold prices is so widespread, and the Central Bank does have the ability to control it, so should the bank maintain a considerable level of gold prices at any time? In other words: is it wise to let it soar to a considerably high level, and then use great pressure to force it down? If it had been sold off in large quantities earlier, so that it could not reach a height of 4 million yuan, and the range of fluctuations in finance and commodity prices could be reduced, would it be beneficial to general industry and commerce, and the general public? These questions seem worth studying. This is the first.</p>
<p>The Central Bank clearly has supreme authority over credit and interest rates. Merely trying its hand at gold policy has been enough to cause the entire market to be turbulent and unable to control itself. Then, the general problem of high interest rates and difficulties in turnover, which is deeply hated, does not seem difficult for the Central Bank to grasp the direction and provide appropriate solutions. That is to say: the problems that industry and commerce are currently suffering from are not without solutions. The only key point lies in what the financial and financial authorities think. This is the second.</p>
<p>Although there have been many past announcements to eliminate speculation and strictly prohibit manipulation, etc. However, judging from the market situation in the past few days, it is clear that there are still many merchants and financiers who are still immersed in it and enjoying themselves. How should we effectively control them in the future and put them on the right track? In particular, how can those engaged in financial business learn from their past mistakes, and promptly return, so as not to affect the entire market? This is really a problem worth paying attention to. This is the third.</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year is coming in the blink of an eye, and the Lunar New Year is not far away. At this time when the crisis in industry and commerce is very serious, everyone is conscientious and pragmatic, and is still afraid that unexpected storms will not be able to escape. Judging from the situation in the past few days, it seems that we are still in a deep dream, and there are too many places where personnel, management, and operation are not perfect. I hope everyone will pay special attention.</p>

Assemblymen Wang Guanzhi and Chu Zuoshi expressed disagreement with the shipping revenue figures in the construction report, stating that they did not match the actual revenue figures. In recent days, the assembly's policy reports have taken up too much time, affecting the time for assemblymen to ask questions. Tong Chunxuan proposed that government policy reports be limited to no more than one hour, which was unanimously approved. In addition, Finance Director Pu Mengjiu and Education Director Wang Shaolun were away on official business and had not returned, so the group review sessions were held in advance, and the finance and education reports were scheduled for another date.</p>
<h3>Nantong River Embankment to Be Prepared for Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch] The river embankment in this county has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in significant losses. Except for a section of stone embankment built from Tianshenggang to Zhouhuang Yini Mountain, which remains intact, most of the rest are low and flimsy, insufficient to withstand the tide. This past summer, a breach occurred, flooding many fields. The outer embankment has almost completely collapsed. The county government has repeatedly petitioned the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission's Jiangsu Dike Closure and Embankment Restoration Engineering Office and the Su-Ning Branch to allocate funds for repairs as soon as possible to reduce the disaster. The Engineering Office sent Deputy Engineer Li Yi to Nantong for inspection. It is estimated that a total of 116,698.2080 cubic meters of material is needed, as well as 175 tons and 9,460 market catties of flour, and 3,500,9460 yuan in legal tender.

<h3>Zhejiang Field Grain Director Urges Collection</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing Dispatch] This year's field tax has been repeatedly ordered by the provincial government to be fully collected by the end of the year. However, due to the many difficulties in this county after the war, it has not been possible to collect the full amount. Chen Yi, the director of the Field Grain Office of Zhejiang Province, and Wang Jingyu, the commissioner of the Ministry of Food, arrived in Huzhou from Hangzhou on the 22nd. In the afternoon at 2 o'clock, they invited the heads of the party, government, assembly, and other groups to a symposium in the county government. Director Chen and Commissioner Wang delivered speeches in succession, stating that the field tax is the main source of income for the central, provincial, and county governments, and that the collection of the field tax this time is extremely urgent and must be fully collected by the end of this year. Any delays will affect important government affairs and will be strictly dealt with. They hoped that all sectors would provide more assistance in the collection of the field tax, and that especially the major grain households should take the lead and enthusiastically pay their taxes in order to achieve practical results. After the meeting, they drove to Wukang and other counties in a special car, strictly ordering the urging of collection.</p>
<h3>Danyang Shops "Fattening Up" Bankruptcy Trend Flourishes</h3>
<p>[Our Danyang Dispatch] Since the autumn, the trend of shop closures has been particularly prevalent in this city. After the winter, the closures have become even more severe. It is, of course, impossible to criticize shops that close and then claim to be settling their debts, but after the shops in this city close, only about 30-40% of their assets are used to repay their debts, such as Tianfutai Xinhua shops in Shuangjing Lane, even only 10-20%. The method of debt settlement...to protect the shop and delay compensation is not a bankruptcy liquidation. This type of liquidation method may actually encourage the trend of fraudulent closures, which will lead to serious consequences. Therefore, it is not necessary to engage in bankruptcy liquidation... debts. Some shops... still have some remaining strength, but they must... intentionally empty the shop, and then suddenly declare bankruptcy. This type of attempt has already been seen in Taicheng, which is simply like a scam.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Higher Court Fourth Branch Established</h3>

<h3>Suzhou Launches Scientific Disaster Relief, Students Collect Old Clothes</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Social Guidance Office of the Suzhou City Defense Headquarters believes that during this winter season, the general poor people of Suzhou are eating wind and sleeping in the open, a situation that is very pitiful. Beggars on the streets begging from door to door not only damage the city's appearance, but also indirectly pose a hidden danger to public security. It is truly necessary to provide relief urgently. Therefore, it has been decided to organize a winter disaster relief association to carry out matters such as distributing cotton clothes, rice, and chestnuts, and establishing shelters. It has now been decided to first mobilize students from primary and secondary schools throughout the county within days to hold a movement to discard old clothes. At the same time, enthusiastic people from the community are also planning to cooperate with the association in its work in order to achieve results.</p>

<h3>Quzhou and Xiudi Dike, Pre-Borrowing Rice to Start Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Quzhou Dispatch] The Yanglai and Dongji one-weir in this county spans most of the north of the county. The weir ditch extends for 25 miles and irrigates more than 100,000 mu of fields. In recent years, due to war and disrepair, the embankments and dikes have mostly collapsed. Previously, County Councilor Chuan Shiping suggested repairs, and he also obtained 12 tons of work-for-relief flour from the Zhejiang Branch. The flour for the project has not yet been distributed, but the West Weir water conservancy project must be started during this winter, when it is permanently dry and there is agricultural slack time. The relevant parties have specially agreed with local people to pre-borrow 300 stones of rice to start the construction of key areas. As for the start of the entire project, it will have to wait until the work-for-relief flour from the Zhejiang Branch is distributed before construction can begin.</p>

<h3>Why is the Power Supply in Ba City So Uneven?</h3>
<p>I live at No. 335 Fumin Road, Nanshi. Every day after work, when I go home to rest, I always live a life of complete darkness without electricity. No matter what I do, I have to grope in the dark. The power outage lasts from morning until 6 pm or even after 7 pm. At this time of traffic obstruction and severe coal shortages, we forgive the difficulties of the China Merchants Electric Company. But what we cannot tolerate is that during our power outage, Laoximen, Laobeimen, Xiaodongmen, and other places are brightly lit, like daylight. If there is not enough electricity, a rotational power outage system could be adopted. Why is there a power outage in the Dadongmen, Xiaonanmen, and Danaanmen districts for more than a week, while other areas have electricity every day? Please provide a clear explanation from the China Merchants Electric Company. (Zheng Yongxiang)</p>
<h3>Request for Demolition of Air Raid Shelter</h3>
<p>A concrete air raid shelter stands in the fields south of the Jiahe Farm in Liuliqiao, Pudong. It was built by our army last summer. Now that the war has ended, the air raid shelter has not yet been demolished. However, because the air raid shelter is very strong and has a large volume, criminals often hide in it as a shelter, and incidents that endanger public security occur from time to time. The owner of the field has repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works to demolish it quickly, but no action has been taken to date, and no instructions have been issued. Therefore, a special letter is sent to your newspaper for publication in order to urge the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works to pay attention! (Wu Shujing)</p>
<h3>Small Hotels in West Shanghai Should Be Corrected</h3>
<p>What I want to report to you is the bad situation of the small hotels in the Xuhui area of Shanghai, such as those on Huai'an Road, Maigen Road, and Kader Road. Recently, they have all refused to allow legitimate business travelers to stay. Because a legitimate guest is generally charged a full day's room rate for two and a half days and one full night (such as from 1 pm to 12 pm the next day, limited to no more than 24 hours), while general unofficial travelers, who use the hotels as places for men and women to engage in illicit affairs, only need a few hours to be charged a full day's room rate, and there are also extra tips. Therefore, the owners and waiters of these small hotels all especially welcome them, so that legitimate guests are refused. They prefer to leave the rooms empty and seek high profits. For example, when a legitimate guest goes to book a room, the waiter will ask, "Sir, are you staying overnight?" If the answer is yes, then the waiter will rudely say, "We're full, there are no rooms!" In fact, many rooms are empty. General speculators or travelers passing through this port can only sigh at the roof, which is infinitely painful in this cold winter season. Having seen this bad situation, I cannot remain silent, so I dare to borrow a corner of the newspaper to reveal it. (A worker in West Shanghai)</p>
<h3>The Bad Habit of "Hitting Oil" Must Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>There is a bad habit in this port that has been inherited from the concession era, which is most popular among the middle and lower classes: "sending out invitations and hitting people up for money." In addition to genuine weddings and funerals, false pretexts are used: "fake birthdays," "fake birthday banquets," "death anniversaries," children's "birthdays," "full months"... some people even celebrate every two or three months. In an average family, more than ten "invitations" are received every month, that is, more than ten at 10,000 yuan per invitation, which amounts to more than 100,000. I ask, how can one cope with this in today's difficult life? Please, in accordance with the New Life Movement's principles of frugality, the government promptly adopt effective measures to strictly ban this bad habit! (Sun Ru)</p>
<h3>Postal Service</h3>
<p>Reply to a gentleman: Your letter pointing out the illegal activities of Mao Cheng, the head of Mao Cheng Township, has been received. A letter from the Pinghu County Government states: "On the afternoon of the 25th day of the lunar calendar, Zhu Xuezhi, the head of Mao Cheng Township, sent Hou Meifu, the squad leader of the National Army Team, and Xiang Ding Wang Wenrong to the first Bao to urge the collection of the price difference for military rations. At Wang Jiaming's house, he illegally sent his wife to the Bao office for being arrogant. Bao Chief Zhu Xiaodi persuaded him to release her, but she died of a miscarriage that night. Her husband then filed a complaint with the County Legal Office. The accused, Hou Meifu, is suspected of being more serious and has been detained pending investigation." Special reply.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works has replied to two items: (1) "Regarding Mr. Xu Zhonghe's statement of damage to the Xuhui Road, etc., it has been ordered to investigate that the pavement of the sidewalk is made of old asphalt blocks. It is now estimated that the damaged area is 50 square meters. In addition to using coal to fill the potholes first, it can be repaired after there are old asphalt gravel materials." (2) "Regarding Mr. Liu Zizhuang's statement that the Guangzhao Road area is dirty and unsanitary, the relevant sanitary parts have been transferred to the Health Bureau for handling directly. Regarding the damage to the sewers, it was found that they were sealed off by the Ministry of Military Affairs and could not be repaired. They have now been unsealed. A method is being devised to replace the missing covers of the manholes with stone strips." Combined reply.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Winter News</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>The cold wave has reached Bengbu, and it is the middle of winter. Between the Huai River embankment and Beng Mountain, the trees are already bare, and yellow leaves cover the ground. After the ravages of war and floods, the cries of suffering are everywhere, and people are starving. The Rapid Relief Corps for the Anhui Eastern District, under the Jing District, has been announced, but when relief goods will be distributed is still unknown. The Bengbu City Relief Institute, which tens of thousands of disaster-stricken people are eagerly awaiting, has long established a fundraising committee. It is said that it has raised 40 to 50 million yuan in funds, but when the Relief Institute will be officially established is still unknown.</p>
<p>Intensify Winter Defense: Two Bandits Executed as a Warning</p>
<p>During the cold season, when the poor are suffering, it is also a time when petty thieves are active. Recognizing that Bengbu is densely populated and has complex traffic, with a mix of good and bad people, the local pacification authorities, considering the importance of security during this winter defense period, have formulated four measures to maintain public order and ordered them to be strictly followed. The four measures are: (1) Strengthen the inspection work at checkpoints to prevent spies from infiltrating the city and disrupting public order. (2) Order the joint military-police patrol teams to strictly enforce orders, rectify soldiers with improper attire, and suppress deserters. (3) Send teams to inspect businesses, hotels, and brothels in sections every night, and crack down on soldiers patronizing prostitutes and prevent undesirable elements from hiding there. (4) Investigate the movement of residents' household registrations in the city and check household registrations to prevent spies from hiding. Although the military and police authorities are strictly enforcing these measures, robbery cases continue to occur. On the evening of the 6th of this month, the home of Chen Yi, a resident of Huangshan Bao in the Western District, was looted by more than ten bandits, who also killed Chen's father, Zhao Hui, with a knife, and took away his nine-year-old son, Chen Jiayu. On the afternoon of the 6th and 7th, there were cases of fraudulent robbery of gold jewelry stores. The victims were Heji Lao Fengxiang, Yuanji Lao Fengxiang, and Lao Tianbao, three stores on Erma Road in the bustling downtown area. The bandits were extremely bold in their robbery. The 8th District Pacification Headquarters specially tied up two soldiers who had committed robbery in the summer and executed them by firing squad outside Nangang in Bengbu at noon on the 9th. One was Huang Bin from Yangshuo, Guangxi, and the other was Xie Senqiao from Guilin, Guangxi. Both had previously served as soldiers in the Supply Bureau. They were executed for robbing shops on Zhashou Road. The authorities clearly intended to deter other bandits by executing these two as an example.</p>
<p>Collapse Imminent: Market Downturn Rampant</p>
<p>Natural disasters and man-made calamities have overlapped, reflecting unrest among bandits and a worrying security situation. The economic downturn is surging towards Bengbu like the yellow floods of autumn. It is winter, and the market is showing signs of indifference and desolation. Now, almost the entire market is shrouded in the shadow of collapse. The industry and commerce here have approached the brink of collapse, and some have even fallen into the deep abyss of collapse. The closure of stores is a concrete manifestation of Bengbu's economic downturn.</p>
<p>According to custom, the phenomenon of tight credit usually occurs near the Lunar New Year. But the beginning of this cold winter is the season when everyone is buying clothes and stocking up on food to prepare for winter. However, although large and small stores are trying their best to attract customers, hiring Western bands, playing loudly, and putting up signs with big discounts, big sales, and unprecedented sacrifices to attract customers, there are few who inquire, which shows that the purchasing power of citizens has decreased and that finance is extremely stagnant.</p>
<p>The downturn, along with the cold wind, has almost swept through the entire Bengbu market. It circles through various industries like a whirlwind. Stores and various businesses are being forced to close or declare liquidation due to the impact of the economic downturn, and this is happening almost daily. According to a survey by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, 33 stores closed in September, 17 in October, and 32 again in November. This month, the Daxin Department Store on Erma Road and the Yiji Zhenye Leather Factory on Zhengping Street have also successively closed down. With the end of the year approaching, it is feared that there will still be businesses that are forced to prepare for closure.</p>
<p>Underground Banks: Extremely Active in Secret</p>
<p>During this period of intense downturn in various industries, only the money industry can still flourish, and the business of discounting is particularly good. Before the war, there were more than 20 money shops in the city. Now there are seven banks: Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, Shanghai Bank, Anhui Bank, and Bengbu City Bank; one silver company, Yumin, Xinchangxiang; and nine money shops, Fucheng, Anli, etc. In addition, there are secret underground banks that are thriving like bamboo shoots after rain due to the needs of the objective environment and are extremely active, engaging in high-interest discounting or lending. They are truly the magic hands of usury in Bengbu. According to Yu Haoru, manager of the Bengbu branch of the Central Bank, he told reporters that the formation of usury is due to the economic downturn. It cannot be said that usury causes the economic downturn, but rather that usury arises due to market demand. Merchants know that drinking poison to quench thirst is not a good plan, but they endure it because they have no other choice. The lending of high-interest loans by underground banks is undoubtedly an illegal act. However, those engaged in such business mostly act in a secretive manner. Although the Central Bank has the power to suppress and prohibit it, it is actually not easy to detect them. (16th)</p>

<h3>French Paratroopers Deployed to Vietnam for Reinforcements: Fierce Fighting Throughout Northern Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th Dispatch] According to French intelligence in London: The 25th Airborne Division of paratroopers stationed in Bona, Algeria, North Africa, will be deployed to Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] It is reported that a unit of paratroopers from the 1st Parachute Division landed on the cruiser "Georges Leygues" from the port of Bona, Algeria, yesterday and headed for Vietnam. An official of the French Ministry of Defense here stated that the Ministry of Defense would not confirm or deny the news of the deployment of paratroopers to Vietnam, as troop movements should be kept secret.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th, United Press] According to Agence France-Presse: The French military headquarters in Hanoi issued a communique stating that the war in northern Vietnam is fierce, but the situation is "satisfactory."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 24th] According to an official communique: In the Vietnamese war, a considerable number of Japanese were found in the Vietnamese army. The French army is currently conducting mopping-up operations in the area of Bo Gan, south of Hanoi. On the highway to Hue, the French army encountered resistance from the Vietnamese army. French aircraft destroyed several Vietnamese artillery units yesterday. Officials believe the situation in Tonkin is satisfactory. In the Ba region, the area controlled by the French army has been expanded, and several attacks by the Vietnamese army have been repelled. Details of large-scale battles on the Haiphong dike in Tonkin (between Hanoi and Haiphong) are still unknown. In Annam, the city of Hue was bombarded by Vietnamese artillery, but the firing was inaccurate. The rumors that the Vietnamese army had occupied the Da Nang airfield? was denied by the French military headquarters in Hanoi. The situation in Yian is unclear.

<h3>Birth of the French Fourth Republic: Senate Held First Meeting Yesterday; Presidential Election in January Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] The French Fourth Republic was formally established today. This is the first constitutional government since the German invasion six years ago. On the day of the birth of the Republic, the war in Vietnam is raging, threatening the foundation of the colonial empire. The Senate of the Republic will convene on January 16 to elect a president. The first presidential candidate is the 62-year-old Socialist leader Auriol, the current speaker of the National Assembly. The new president will appoint a prime minister to form a new cabinet to replace Blum's interim cabinet.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The Senate of the French Republic held its first meeting at the Luxembourg Palace at 2:30 PM today. The oldest senator, Cachen, served as interim chairman and gave a welcome speech, praising the French army for its ability to liberate France with the help of the Allied forces. At the same time, he expressed admiration for General de Gaulle, which aroused enthusiastic applause from all senators (except the Communist senators). Before the end of the opening ceremony, Cachen met with the heads of the delegations of various parties to establish the Congress staff. According to the principle of equal distribution, the 13 members of the Presidium are distributed as follows: 4 members each for the People's Republican Party and the Communist Party, 2 members each for the Socialist Party and the Left Wing Alliance, and 1 member for the Right Wing Alliance. There are also 3 vice-chairmen, 6 secretaries, and 6 financial secretaries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The French Fourth Republic has been formally established. In the future, the laws passed by the National Assembly must be submitted to the Senate for review. The Senate has the right to send the bill back to the House for reconsideration, but it cannot veto it. The Senate is scheduled to elect a speaker on Friday. The candidate with the most hope of being elected is Triboulet of the People's Republican Party. He served as a cabinet member as early as 1929 and was a powerful figure in resisting Vichy and the Germans during the war. It is said that the Socialist Party also intends to support Triboulet as the speaker of the Senate. At the same time, various political parties are also actively preparing for the presidential election. No official candidate has been nominated yet, but unofficial candidates include former Prime Minister Herriot, leader of the Radical Party, and Auriol, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Herriot supported the Communist Party's views and is therefore deeply supported by the Communist Party. The constitution stipulates that the president is elected by members of the Senate and the House of Representatives at a meeting in Versailles, but the constitution does not specify whether to use open or secret voting.</p>
<h3>France's Plan for Germany: US Has No Objections</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The decision taken by France to control the border of the Saar region has not caused any objection from US officials. A State Department spokesman recently told the press that the head of the French delegation to the UN General Assembly, Mauville, had informed the French and American governments of the change in the administrative issue. The US representative never protested against the French plan during negotiations with France.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The French government has decided to release 70 German prisoners of war in the Saar region in the short term. These prisoners of war worked in French coal mines and were allowed to return home to visit their families this summer.</p>
<h3>World Food Situation: Future Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] FAO Secretary-General Orr announced today that the world food situation has not improved compared to last year and that there will be a great shortage before the 1947 harvest season. In addition to the damage caused by the war, the countries of the East will also need to prepare sufficient food for the increasing population in the coming years. This situation becomes more obvious year by year. The second half of 1946 proved to be deficient in most areas, but the new harvest beginning in 1947 will greatly improve the situation. In the nine eastern provinces of China, Korea, and Taiwan, the impact of the war has kept grain production at a low standard. In terms of rice exports, the acreage of Myanmar, Siam, and Vietnam continues to be lower than the average, and only a small amount of inventory is available for export.</p>

<h3>Spaak Report: UN General Assembly Report</h3>
<p>Claimed that the Harvest Was Quite Significant</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Brussels, 24th] Belgian Foreign Minister and UN General Assembly President Spaak, who had just returned to Brussels from New York, recently gave a speech to the press, reporting that the results obtained from this UN General Assembly were quite significant and can be regarded as of a positive nature. The UN General Assembly also had its shortcomings, namely: (1) The location used by the UN organization to hold meetings is too far from the city; (2) If representatives of various countries use their native languages, it will make the debate too slow. However, some issues, especially the South African Indian issue and the Spanish Franco regime issue, have been resolved, which is very satisfactory. As for the issue of reducing armaments, significant progress has been made, which is a step further than we had hoped. The UN organization is very different from the old League of Nations. The old League of Nations was a conference of diplomats, while the UN General Assembly is a conference of politicians. This is the difference. Women occupy important positions everywhere in the UN organization, which is eye-catching, and the status of "people of color" is also becoming increasingly important. Regarding the German issue, the four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Moscow on March 20 next year to discuss this matter. Belgium has not yet received an invitation to participate. As for Belgium's demands on Germany, I will be able to explain them in detail to the government and parliament before I can explain them. In short, there are still many factors in the German issue that are not fully understood. If you act rashly, you will definitely make a big mistake; on the other hand, if you let it mature, you will definitely gain something.</p>

Li continued to say that the US occupying forces had no idea of ​​retaliation against Germany at the beginning. The current situation in Germany is due to the Nazi dictatorship. The US will do everything possible to improve the German economic situation. The British and American occupation zones have already merged economically and will be self-sufficient in three years. US officials estimate that this amnesty will allow the US occupation zone's rectification plan to be completed within 18 months. Previously, officials announced that at the current rate of reporting, it would take eight years to complete.</p>

It is believed that the Prime Minister will extend his stay in the United States to maintain contact with representatives of various commercial firms related to the United States. These commercial firms are preparing to carry out reconstruction work in Greece.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aristocratic Class: Will Be Reduced to Commoners</h3>
<p>From Now On, They Will Only Live a Poor Life</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 25th] The military warlords and financial tycoons who once drove the Japanese people have completely collapsed. The imperial and aristocratic systems that still maintain feudal institutions are now under review by the parliament and the Privy Council. Except for the three direct imperial families, the other eleven imperial families and 52 nobles have decided to become commoners starting from next spring. In addition, the government has stopped providing the so-called aristocratic salaries to the aristocratic class, and the aristocratic class once had the privilege of tax exemption, which has also been decided to follow. Therefore, the nobles who once enjoyed a privileged life will also live a similarly poor life as ordinary people.</p>

However, in this fiscal year, the government has already scheduled to issue public bonds of 46,507 million yen. By the end of this fiscal year, the total debt will be 240 billion yen. If the 30 billion yen for war insurance compensation bonds are added, it will reach 270 billion yen. If it is necessary to submit an additional budget to the ordinary council, it will be necessary to issue public bonds again. It is feared that by the end of this fiscal year, the amount of domestic debt may actually reach 300 billion yen, which is 11 times higher than the 25 billion yen of domestic debt in 1940, before the start of the Pacific War.</p>

<h3>Economic Control Fails: Thailand Brewing Political Storm; Former Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong Will Make a Comeback</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 24th] People in Thailand's political circles recently said that the hidden unrest among members of the Thai parliament may trigger a serious political storm. This unrest is caused by the rising degree of restriction on commercial life and the control of food supply. The crisis first broke out in the government itself and then spread to various parties. However, well-informed sources here are particularly reserved about changes in the government's lineup and its policies. The general public expects that if a political storm occurs, former Prime Minister and leader of the Democratic Party Khuang Aphaiwong will be able to take on the arduous task. Khuang Aphaiwong resigned as Prime Minister because the parliament passed a bill on economic control. He is currently in the United States and is said to be returning to Thailand in the short term.</p>

When reporters asked Mr. Roosevelt how he got to see Marshal Stalin, he said, "In the usual way." Reporters also asked Mr. Roosevelt to comment on the British plan to erect a memorial statue of his father in London. Mr. Roosevelt said that he did not want to participate in the debate about whether the statue should be sitting or standing, but the intention of building the statue was a great honor.</p>
<h3>US Industrial Production Value: Has Made Significant Progress</h3>
<p>Future Depends on Labor Situation</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] President Truman announced today that the output of US industrial recovery has increased by at least 50% compared to the average output in 1930, and in the past six months, it has repeatedly set new production records in peacetime. Former Director of the Private Production Division Small said in a report submitted to President Truman that labor and management must cooperate to avoid further strikes, otherwise the good results achieved in post-war production and employment will be lost. In fact, the number of employed people in the United States has reached a peak, between 57 million and 58 million, an unprecedented record in US history. This number is 14 million more than the 1939 wartime employment.</p>

<h3>Christmas Eve: A Heartfelt Plea</h3>
<p>The Pope Says: The Church is like a compassionate mother, mercy is her divine calling. To inspire compassion and mutual aid among humanity, she feels compelled to speak out...</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, December 24th] Pope Pius XII, in his Christmas Eve broadcast to the world, earnestly appealed to world leaders to strive for a just peace. He urged victorious nations to abandon selfish notions and consider the needs of the majority of people, especially the youth. The Pope pointed out that the rift between the victorious and defeated nations is greater after this war than ever before. Even today, the consequences of victory and their impact remain a source of pain. True human love and the Catholic Church cannot stand idly by in the face of such phenomena. From the Church's perspective, she only wishes to lead people to eternal salvation and has no intention of interfering in or participating in world disputes. The Church is like a compassionate mother, mercy is her divine calling. Now, to inspire compassion and mutual aid among humanity, she feels compelled to speak out. We recall that when the Atlantic Charter was first established, people around the world were delighted. However, to this day, the various difficulties in establishing peace have not been overcome. It is hoped that the leaders of all nations will use their great power to establish a just peace and accomplish this great task. None of us can say that the world's problems have been clearly resolved. How to deal with unprecedented new weapons, although already discussed in conference, may still prevent future peace treaties from being perfect. Therefore, the Church's appeal is necessary in the current environment. The Church is not afraid of the anti-religious tide that exists in various places today. It is our duty to speak out justly. I express my deep concern and sympathy for the suffering of people in war-torn countries. In April, I already petitioned other governments and people to provide assistance. Since then, people with humanitarian and Christian spirits have responded enthusiastically, making the glory of mankind shine again. However, because the disaster area is vast, assistance is still insufficient. Therefore, it is hoped that those with surplus strength will actively rescue the suffering and hungry, especially children and youth facing starvation, regardless of borders or nationalities, and do their best to provide relief, so that the concepts of revenge and competition can be completely eliminated, and a Christian world of great harmony can be rebuilt in the shattered civilization.</p>
<h3>Truman's Address</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, December 24th] President Truman, in his Christmas address to the American people, stated: We have completed a good starting point for establishing world peace, but there remains a major task of securing world peace in the future. The world today seems to lack harmony and compromise. We now know that it is easier for mankind to share adversity than to share prosperity, but if we cannot maintain peace, then the lives of soldiers are sacrificed in vain. The problems facing the United Nations are daunting, but as we continue to strive for peace, we should not forget that the world was not built in a day. Fortunately, this Christmas, the overall situation has improved, which is quite exciting.</p>
<h3>Benes' Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, December 24th] Czech President Dr. Benes, in his Christmas Eve broadcast to the nation, expressed his belief that there would be no more world wars in this generation. He pointed out that the global situation before Christmas shows that the friendship between major leading nations is increasing and the foundation of peace is being strengthened. The world is now eagerly awaiting the completion of the German peace treaty. Germany itself must repent of the past and implement spiritual peace and democracy to prove its determination to reform.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Tragedy in Heavy Fog: Three Airliners Crash on the Same Night: One of the Two Planes from Chongqing Belonging to China National Aviation Corporation Crashes in Longhua: Almost All 29 Passengers and Crew Members Perish</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The weather in the city yesterday was exceptionally bad. Thick rain and fog enveloped Longhua Airport, obscuring the ground, causing two China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) airliners from Chongqing to Shanghai to crash yesterday evening as they were unable to land, one crashing at the airport and the other in Huadi, Pudong, resulting in heavy casualties. Another CNAC airliner from Beijing to Shanghai managed to land near Jiangwan Airport.</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, two CNAC airliners from Chongqing took off for Shanghai. One was a C-47 type aircraft, number 140, flown by American pilot Greenwood, co-pilot Mr. Liu (L.S. Liu), and radio operator Mr. Jin (K. King), which took off from Chongqing's Coral Dam battlefield. The other was a C-46 type aircraft, number 115, flown by American pilot Prdus, co-pilot Mr. Tan (H.C. Tan), and radio operator Mr. Wang (S.T. Wang), which took off from Baishi, Chongqing.</p>
<p>Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the two aircraft stopped over in Hankou one after another, and then continued to fly to Shanghai. When passing Nanjing, because the weather in Nanjing was also exceptionally bad, they did not land and flew directly to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Aircraft number 140 first arrived over Shanghai around 5:00 PM. Due to the thick fog, it was unable to land. Although it repeatedly contacted the airport's radio control tower, reporting that it could not determine the direction of the runway, it ultimately could not land. Therefore, aircraft number 140 circled over the city for two and a half hours. At 7:55 PM, the aircraft was right above the airport when its fuel ran out, and it immediately lost its ability to fly. The nose suddenly tilted downwards and plunged straight to the ground. First there was the sound of the engine stalling, then a sharp, ear-piercing sound cut through the night sky as it hurtled towards the ground. In a flash, there was a crash, and the aircraft crashed at the airport. A fire briefly started. At that time, the airport personnel were urgently devising rescue measures and had already summoned two fire trucks and two ambulances from the fire department, which had arrived and were waiting. They immediately rushed to the crash site for emergency rescue.</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter obtained the news within ten minutes of the aircraft crash and immediately rushed to Longhua Airport to investigate. The aircraft was found to have crashed about a dozen yards to the side of the north-south runway, only two or three hundred yards south of the South Huangpu River. The tail of the aircraft was facing northwest, and the entire section from the middle of the fuselage, from the door five feet upwards to the nose, had been completely shattered. The wings had flown more than a dozen yards away and were separated from the fuselage. The tail was sticking up and was also broken. Within a radius of more than a dozen storefronts near the crash site, there were bodies of dead male and female passengers and shattered clothing, etc. By the light of a flashlight, the reporter witnessed the body of a woman in her twenties lying prostrate in the mud, only five feet from the aircraft door, dressed elegantly.</p>
<p>It was later confirmed that there were a total of 26 passengers on the aircraft. Thirteen people died on the spot. The remaining thirteen people (nine men and four women) were rushed to Zhongshan Hospital, where six of them died in the ambulance. Only seven people were actually treated at the hospital. The reporter went to the hospital to inquire. According to the doctor, two of them were in a coma after surgery, four were in critical condition, and only one had a reasonable chance of survival. Among the above-mentioned people, four were women, one was dead, one was in critical condition, and the conditions of the other two were unknown. As of the time of publication, the airline was still inquiring with Chongqing about the list of the dead and injured passengers, and it was not yet clear. According to the reporter's visit to the only one who was slightly injured, her face was extremely swollen and bandaged, and she was mumbling unintelligibly.</p>
<p>It was also learned that the pilot died with a ruptured diaphragm, and the co-pilot had a pierced abdomen and intestines and could not be saved. Only the radio operator, Mr. Jin, was sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>The Second Aircraft Crashes Soon After</p>
<p>When aircraft number 140 crashed, aircraft number 115 was still circling in the sky, unable to land. When the reporter drove to the entrance of the airport, he saw this aircraft suddenly fly from south to north, across the sky, only two hundred feet above the ground. This was around 9:10 PM. After that, the airport no longer heard any news from it. CNAC personnel later received a report that aircraft number 115 had also crashed in Pudong at 9:30 PM. They immediately sent people out to search. The U.S. Navy and the Maritime Police Bureau also sent boats to assist in the search. However, its wreckage had not been found by midnight.</p>
<p>According to inquiries made by the reporter to the guards along the South Huangpu River and the gatekeeper of the Shanghai Cement Factory, they saw this aircraft flying low from northeast to southwest, and then heard a loud noise, but did not see any fire. The general location was five or six li south of the Taishan Cement Factory in Pudong.</p>
<p>China Central Airlines aircraft also forced to land</p>
<p>As for an aircraft belonging to Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), after being warned by the control tower, it flew to Jiangwan Airport and was forced to land near the Yunzaobing River. At that time, a civilian house was destroyed, killing one woman in the house and injuring three. The names of the injured were Zhang Lu, 46 years old, Zhang Yubao, 11 years old (female), and Zhang Xinde, 14 years old (female), all with severe head injuries. The deceased was Zhang Lu's daughter-in-law. All the injured were sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Replacing Melton Cloth: New Goods are Being Expedited</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Public Education Personnel Goods Distribution Office announced that more than 40,000 yards of Melton cloth and more than 10,000 yards of uniform cloth had been sold, all supplied by China Textile Corporation. The original price was 30,000 yuan per yard for Melton cloth and 15,000 yuan per yard for uniform cloth. Later, as the market price of American goods fell day by day, the office consulted with China Textile Corporation to reduce the price, which was reduced to 25,000 yuan per yard for Melton cloth and 11,000 yuan per yard for uniform cloth. The office added a handling fee of 500 yuan per yard, and the next day announced the refund of the difference in price. However, the Melton cloth allocated by China Textile Corporation this time was often different from the original sample and of slightly inferior quality, which led to the return of goods by various institutions. Repeated requests were made to China Textile Corporation to replace the goods, and more than 5,000 yards of returned goods were sent to China Textile Corporation for acceptance. Recently, the company was in urgent need of distributing cloth to public education personnel in Beijing, so it has not yet delivered the new goods as soon as possible. The office is actively urging the company to do so, and it is said that it will be able to receive and redistribute the goods within a few days.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Commemorate Dai Tianfang: Devoted to Dental Education: Unfortunately Died in a Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Dai Tianfang, courtesy name Shugu, was from Neijiang, Sichuan. On the 14th, he took a Central Air Transport Corporation flight from Nanjing to Shanghai on official business, and unfortunately died in a plane crash in Changxing. Dai had profound knowledge and was one of the leading dental experts in our country. After graduating from West China Union University in 1934, he became the director of the dental department of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital, which was organized by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. After the outbreak of the war, he served in a hospital in Guangxi Province assigned by the National Health Administration. In 1940, he went to the United States to specialize in public oral hygiene. In 1942, he returned to China and served as the vice president of the School of Dentistry of West China Union University and the director of the Oral Hospital. After the victory, he served as the director of the dental department of the Nanjing Central Hospital, and was appointed by the Examination Yuan as a specialized examiner. He was also a member of the Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education and the Dental Education Design Committee of the National Health Administration, and established the Dentist Law. He devoted himself to dental education and has not yet established his own clinic to earn a living.

<h3>US Merchant Ship Tears Underwater Cable, Power Supply Cut-Off to Pudong</h3>
<p>At 2:01 PM yesterday, the US merchant ship Stag Hound, at the Shipaotai of Nanshi, tore a 33,000-volt underwater cable during anchorage, causing the cable to break, the iron tower to buckle, and the joints to snap, leading to a power outage in the entire Pudong area and impacting the Hu-Ding switch, which led to an interruption in the current supply to Zhabei and Nanshi at the same time. After the concerned electric company hurried to repair the Hu-Xi switch, Zhabei and Nanshi power were gradually restored, but because the cable damage in Pudong was substantial and repair would take time, the power supply to the entire district could not be provided temporarily. The motors used in factories must all be temporarily shut down. There are still 6,600-volt and 500-volt cables from the Pudong Electric Company and the Shanghai Tongdian Company that can be connected for use, but the capacity is too small and can only maintain a portion of the lights.</p>
<h3>Two Commit Suicide by Poisoning</h3>

<h3>Two Major US Cruisers Stationed in Shanghai Treat Orphaned and Distressed Children: Children in Need Outside the Gates of Paradise Enjoyed Half a Day of Heavenly Life</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Christmas is over. Even though a Christmas dinner costs 100,000 yuan and a cup of tea in a dance hall costs 30,000 yuan, in addition to being charged an entry fee, the entertainment venues are still packed. How many darlings of fortune enjoyed turkeys, sipped champagne, and revelled until dawn during this happy season!</p>
<p>Also on Christmas Eve, also in Shanghai, perhaps right in front of the dance hall, at the foot of the cafe wall, those forgotten wretches were enduring the torment of hunger and cold, struggling on the lifeline with their last breath!</p>
<p>Naturally, those darlings of fortune in the greenhouse do not know. Who would want to let those tattered beggars spoil the festive mood on this auspicious day?</p>
<p>Warmly Welcomed to Spend a Joyful Day Together</p>
<p>Grateful for the warmth of our Chinese friends, they did not forget the Chinese children living in hardship in the midst of excessive joy. The two major cruisers anchored on the Huangpu River, the USS Los Angeles and the USS Helena, specially hosted 200 suffering children from the Caohongjing Refugee Children's Shelter in Shanghai and dozens of Russian refugee children on Christmas Day to spend the festival. Those children in need who had been wandering the streets and were rejected outside the gates of paradise enjoyed half a day of heavenly life.</p>
<p>The US Navy's reception was very thoughtful. At exactly 12 noon, two giant landing craft were already waiting on the beach. They helped the children into the boats one by one, took them to the cruisers, fed them Western food, then led them around the ship, screened movies in the large hall, and finally Santa Claus dressed up and distributed a large number of gifts...</p>
<p>Western Food, Candy, and Gifts</p>
<p>This day was extraordinary for the children in need. Landing craft, cruisers, a White Russian interpreter, SW coffee, fine Western food, Walt Disney cartoons, Santa Claus in a red robe, candies and toys from the stocking... Everything was unprecedented, and everything would forever become a lifelong miracle!</p>
<p>When the children picked up knives and forks that they had never touched before and took the delicious Western food, I wonder what they were thinking? The director of the refugee children's shelter, Zhou Zuwang, told me that he was thinking about what those children left behind in the shelter were doing. It turned out that these 200 children were the lucky ones who were chosen by drawing lots. There were still more than a thousand children left in the shelter, eating "travel ration" black flour for Christmas. At the same time, he was also wondering how the thousands of beggars who were sleeping on the streets and drinking the northwest wind were going to spend Christmas.</p>
<p>When Will Santa Claus Come Again?</p>
<p>Captain Fuchili of the USS Los Angeles and Captain Bailu of the USS Helena were very touched by the children's politeness and orderliness. In addition to the warm reception, they also personally waved farewell from the deck.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM in the dim drizzle, the children bid farewell to the giant cruisers. As the landing craft carried them across the Huangpu River, I believe that every child laden with gifts wanted to ask, "When will Santa Claus come again"? Who can give them a definite answer?</p>

<h3>Christmas Tidbits　Calendar and Picture Sales Thrive　Dance Hall Tea Fees Multiply</h3>
<p>The Christmas peak has passed, and the wealthy are busy preparing for the New Year, while in another half-month, they'll be busy preparing for the Lunar New Year. Busy coming and going, all for the sake of celebrating the New Year and festivals. Those struggling to make ends meet are worrying about not having rice to cook, so they hardly care whether it's a New Year or a holiday.</p>
<p>On Culture Street, seasonal goods like calendars, New Year's cards, and pictures are selling best. Newly arrived American New Year's cards, exquisite and beautiful, start at a minimum price of one thousand yuan, and go up to three thousand yuan, with eager buyers. Among picture sales, wholesalers near Shanghai are the biggest buyers. The pictures still mostly use "Investiture of the Gods," "Journey to the West," and Liu, Guan, and Zhang swearing brotherhood as backgrounds, with modern additions of atomic bomb war scenes. Pictures of beautiful women emerging from baths are certainly attractive, causing people to stop and stare.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at major intersections on various roads, people were distributing leaflets printed by the Tianan Church Christmas Celebration Preparatory Committee, which read: "Today's human heart is filled with the desire for gold. The desire for leadership stirs hands, creating waves, using brains to scheme and plot, mouths chanting peace, planning war. The full are full, the hungry are hungry, such an unequal situation. We Christians have a report: Today is</p>
<p>Jesus's birthday. Believe in this Savior who atones for sins and establishes the Kingdom of Heaven, so that you can get rid of selfish desires, be reborn with love, and enter eternal life, otherwise you will all perish together. If you don't believe this, think about the above, which is the only turning point, come and believe in Jesus, for he is love, and what people lack today is love."</p>
<p>For the past two days, tea fees at various dance halls have increased five or six times or more. It seems the price will not return to normal before the Lunar New Year. Using price increases to commemorate the holidays best illustrates the prosperity of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cold wind and rain in front of the Great World Guanshengyuan entrance, a middle-aged man, wearing only a single layer of clothing and barefoot, was on the verge of death.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Reporting Traitors　High Court Has Not Received Orders</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's report) It is rumored that the deadline for reporting traitors is the end of this year, and that prosecutors will not accept cases after the deadline. The reporter visited the persons in charge of the High Court and the Procuratorate of the High Court of this city for this purpose. It is said that they have not yet received the relevant order.</p>
<h3>Sun Youquan and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's report) According to news from the High Procuratorate, Sun Youquan, Huang Zhaoxin, Lu Tianyou, Deng Junshan, Tao Xuesheng, Zhu Shaochen, and other six people are suspected of being traitors and have been prosecuted. Cui Renwei and Zhuang Ningnian's cases of suspected traitors will not be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Sun Chunsheng Case　Summons Witnesses</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's report) Sun Chunsheng, the real estate tycoon during the enemy puppet period, was retried at the High Court yesterday afternoon, and the witness Zhang Yifan was summoned for questioning. After the questioning was completed, the court ordered a retrial to be held at a later date. Also, the High Court yesterday subpoenaed Zhu Zhensheng, the president of the former Qingpu County Hospital, and Cai Agen, who was once the foreman carpenter of the Huasheng Tobacco Company. After a trial, both were postponed for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chen Mo's Incorrect Jurisdiction　Transferred to District Court for Trial</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's report) Chen Mo, who once served as the captain of the Vanguard Corps of the Loyal National Salvation Army and later abandoned his official career to engage in business, was accused of taking a Qianlong imperial folding fan from the home of the traitor Liang Hongzhi. After the High Court concluded its trial on the 19th, it was announced in the Criminal Division 1 of the High Court yesterday morning that the case had incorrect jurisdiction and would be transferred to the District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Prison　The Recent Living Conditions of More Than 500 Traitors</h3>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) In the midst of rumors of a deadline for reporting traitors, let us take a look at the current living conditions of more than 500 traitors who are currently detained in Shanghai Prison, both convicted and unconvicted:</p>
<p>Clothing: According to prison regulations, both convicted and unconvicted prisoners must wear prison uniforms. However, because the prison suddenly "welcomed" so many "distinguished guests" after the victory, there were not enough prison uniforms to distribute, so unconvicted prisoners were specially allowed to wear everyday clothes. Therefore, when appearing in court for trial, they still mostly wear suits, long robes, and their families can send and change clothes every week.</p>
<p>Food: Each person's daily prisoner ration is 20 taels of rice, divided into two meals. Because there are many people, they are transported in batches for food, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Vegetables are added to the white rice, which is called "Gaijiao Rice" in the prison. However, the general "rich traitors" have their families send canned food and fresh fruits every week to replace "Gaijiao Rice," and they ignore it.</p>
<p>Accommodation: Zhong Prison is a five-story cement building with a total of 374 cells. Because there are more rooms than people, some people live alone, some live in pairs, and the maximum in each room does not exceed three people. Except for the old and weak, it is generally not allowed to set up beds. Those "prominent officials" who used to sleep on "Simmons" sofas now have to taste the taste of sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Travel: Prisoners living in small iron-barred rooms consider it an unparalleled enjoyment to be able to step out of the prison room and walk around every day, calling it "liberation." Prison regulations stipulate that the doors are opened at 7:00 AM to allow them to take a walk in the corridor or patio, or chat with friends in need, and then closed at 11:00 AM, and re-locked in the prison room. This way, they are opened at 1:30 PM and closed again at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The "rentiers" in Zhong Prison are spending their days in this way of life. External books and newspapers are not allowed to read, but they also know a lot of news. After the verdict is confirmed, they will move to Xiao Prison. At that time, they must change into prison uniforms, and they can visit their families once every two weeks, and they must also work. Fortunately, the equipment in the prison workshop is very good, with printing, canning, garment making, etc. Depending on the work results, they can also have a little income every month. At this time, "ministers," "governors," coolies, special officials, or thieves are all mixed together, and there is no distinction between "classes."</p>
<p>The hospital equipment in the prison is very good, and there are special rubber rooms for people with mental illness. The reformatory is equipped with musical instruments for cultivating the mood. There are many literati and elegant scholars in Zhong Prison, so there used to be an organization of calligraphy and painting clubs, and they would write poems and paint in their spare time, studying each other. It is said that Cai Pei and others recite Buddhist scriptures, and Yuan Lvdeng and Shen Siliang gather with Christians every Sunday to worship. Is this to express repentance in the iron window years and prison life, or to seek spiritual liberation?</p>
<h3>Shen Siliang Case Summons Four Witnesses　Names and Profits　Inviting University Students to Gather at the High Court to Attend the Hearing</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's report) Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was charged with serving as a puppet official, and the High Procuratorate filed a lawsuit against him on suspicion of being a traitor. The first trial was held on the 15th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, the Criminal Division 2 of the High Court summoned the four witnesses Ni Baochun, Yang Kuanlin, Huang Jiade, and Zhang Sumin. The defendant was not summoned. Yesterday, many professors and students from St. John's University came to the court to attend the hearing, and several foreign professors also arrived. The inquiry lasted for more than an hour before it was completed. The statements of the witnesses are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Ni Baochun</p>
<p>During his time as a professor at St. John's University, he and Shen Siliang both served as members of the Physicians Committee. The mission of the committee was to find ways to transport physicians and medical equipment to the rear for the opening of the Guan-Dian Highway, and a contract was signed with the Southwest Transportation Office of the Military Commission in Hong Kong, sending more than 20 doctors and more than 100 assistants to the rear. After he left Shanghai for Kunming, Shen Siliang succeeded him as the director-general of the committee until traffic was cut off after the outbreak of the Pacific War, and the original contract signed by the committee and the Southwest Transportation Office was presented.</p>
<p>Yang Kuanlin</p>
<p>Dean of the School of Civil Engineering of the university, he said: The defendant's assumption of a puppet position was completely to perfunctorily deal with the enemy puppets, and his purpose was purely to maintain the school. Because the Japanese thought to confiscate St. John's University's property, they had to deal with them falsely. Regarding the court's inquiry about the school's hiring of Japanese advisors Yoshitaka Sakamoto and Daikichi Tagawa, he said: They were not advisors, but two Japanese professors who taught economics and history courses, and never interfered in the administration of the school.</p>
<p>Huang Jiade</p>
<p>Vice-President of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences of the university, he said: Shen Siliang's appointment as president of St. John's University was due to the appointment of the school's Huang Association. Most of the defendant's puppet positions were announced by the enemy puppet newspapers without consent. Because the enemy newspapers often published inaccurate news reports, and he took his own case as an example. This time, the Ta Kung Pao published a report that a plane crashed in Changxing, and he also died, but it was not true, and St. John's University was regarded by the enemy puppets at that time as having a long history, so all educational and cultural groups were forced to take a copy, regardless of whether they agreed or not. Under the pressure of the enemy puppets at that time, there was no other way to refuse except to close St. John's. As for the enemy management committee, it was to protect the property of St. John's University. He was not very clear about other puppet positions except for the puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee. Another person in custody was transferred</p>
<p>Zhang Sumin</p>
<p>To testify, Zhang was the director of the Puppet Ministry of Finance and the director of the Puppet Industrial Property Management Office. He said: The office was entirely organized by Chinese people, and the Japanese transferred the so-called enemy puppet property to the office for distribution. Because Shen Siliang was originally the president of the school, he handed it over to him for safekeeping. The purpose was to protect the property of the Anglo-American Church. Shen Siliang had no name in the office, and no ceremony was held upon receipt. Finally,</p>
<h3>First Case Involving Pre-War Deposits　Appeal of Four Banks Savings Society Concluded</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's report) The first case involving the repayment of pre-war deposits, Chen Jilin's lawsuit against the Four Banks Savings Society, was adjudicated by the district court to increase payment by a factor of 1,000. The Four Banks Savings Society was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. The hearing was held yesterday, and the lawyer representing the appellant argued two points: (1) The depreciation of the legal tender is indeed a real fact. Prices have risen hundreds of times in the past year from last year to this year. If an increased payment is required due to the depreciation of the legal tender, the social finance will be unimaginable. (2) The appreciation of bank real estate, before liquidation, cannot know whether it has actually obtained benefits. Recklessly estimating prices is only speculation and has no legal basis. The court announced that the debate was over because the facts of the case were clear, and announced that the judgment would be made at a later date.</p>
<h3>City Council Suggestions: Please Improve Treatment of Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The City Council has received over seventy suggestions from citizens in recent days, and councilors have also submitted over ten proposals. Today, a letter was received from a citizen suggesting improvements to the treatment of prisoners. Councilors Zhou Xiangsheng, Chen Gongda, and Qu Yue proposed that bail for criminal suspects should primarily be secured by reliable shop guarantees, rather than solely by cash deposits, so that poor defendants are not disadvantaged. The following is an excerpt of the citizen's suggestions:</p>
<p>A letter from Leng Jun of 101 Wuyi Road requests that all levels of court be advised to: (1) Allow prisoners' wives and friends to visit the prison once or twice a month, and permit appropriate sexual activity. (2) Vigorously improve prisoners' food and lodging, ensuring an adequate quantity of nutritious food that meets hygiene standards. (3) During their sentences, prisoners should receive knowledge through instruction by teaching staff from municipal schools who volunteer in rotation to correct the criminals' thoughts and behaviors, thereby reducing social disputes.</p>
<h3>Rubber Shoe Sole Industry Reaches Agreement</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The work stoppage dispute between the rubber shoe sole manufacturing industry and Runfeng Rubber Company has been resolved through the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau. A reconciliation record was created yesterday, with the following terms: (1) All twelve workers in the rubber shoe sole department will be reinstated. (2) The department will subsidize the wages for the period of the work stoppage, with each worker receiving 100,000 yuan, totaling 1.2 million yuan. (3) All workers will resume work from December 24th.</p>
<p>Defense Attorney</p>
<p>Attorney Hong Shi rose and stated: The defendant's protection of the school was his mission. In the four months before the victory, the Japanese still wanted to seize the school's assets. If the defendant had intended to collude with the enemy and puppets, the school property would not have been so completely protected. Regarding the defendant's attendance at the puppet education administrative meeting, the defense counsel had written to Yan Shibian, the chairman of the school board. According to the reply, it was very difficult for the school at the time to avoid becoming enslaved and unregistered and to maintain its original state. If it did not participate in the puppet education administrative meeting, the school risked being closed. Therefore, the defendant attended under orders. A certificate of proof was immediately submitted. Subsequently, defense attorney Mi Xitong rose and submitted two letters from graduates of the school, thanking the defendant for assisting them in their studies during the enemy and puppet period. He also stated that when Shanghai fell, recruiting talent to send to work in the rear was quite dangerous.</p>
<h3>Tan Yuebo Sentenced to Three Years</h3>
<p>Xu Jinlong and Lu Zhaoyuan Acquitted</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The High Court delivered judgments on two minor traitor cases yesterday morning: (1) Tan Yuebo, who served as director of the puppet tax bureaus in Taizhou and Yangzhou, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for three years, and his property was confiscated according to law. (2) Xu Jinlong and Lu Zhaoyuan, accused of manufacturing military leather shoes for the enemy, were acquitted.</p>
<h3>Report Reception of Fraud at Any Time: The City Council Will Form a Committee to Assist the Supervisory Authority in Conducting Investigations</h3>
<p>Local councils, with the short deadline of the investigation team, the people are difficult to extend, and it is intended to extend the abolition, to comfort the people's hope, and to request the central government for approval. The chairman sent an e-mail: "Regarding the unfinished work after the end of the investigation team, it has been entrusted to the supervisory envoys of each region to continue handling it. However, in the future, if the people or public opinion organs in various places continue to discover fraud in the reception, they can still report it to the supervisory authority based on the facts and assist in its investigation." Now the Qingwu City Council has set up an investigation and reception committee to assist in continuing the investigation in order to eliminate the abuses, in order to eliminate corruption and to promote justice, and to ask the council to deal with it uniformly. It is reported that the council has already handed over this proposal to the joint meeting of conveners for review.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Propaganda Committee Discusses Expanding Propaganda Plan Held its First Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee's Propaganda Committee held its first meeting at the City Party Headquarters on Aitang Road at 3 PM on the 24th. The chairman of the committee, Fang Zhi, was in Beijing on official business and was replaced by Xie Renzhao, the secretary-general of the City Party Headquarters. First, the chairman reported, stating briefly: After the establishment of the Winter Relief Committee, the relief work has been actively underway. The task of the propaganda committee is to promote the propaganda work related to winter relief. Today's ten-thousandth meeting is to discuss the expansion of the propaganda plan.</p>
<p>Funds Still Need to Be Raised</p>
<p>Subsequently, He Dekui, the general manager of the Winter Relief Committee, reported on the general situation of the work after the establishment of the committee, stating briefly: The Winter Relief Committee's shelter has been established, located on Tongzhou Road, with a target of 4,000 refugees to be rescued. It has already accommodated more than 700 people, and another 400 people can continue to be accommodated in the next two days. The budgeted funds for relief are 100 million yuan, of which 40 million yuan will be allocated by the municipal government, and 20 million yuan was originally requested from the Ministry of Social Affairs, with the remaining 40 million yuan to be raised by the fundraising committee. Since the Ministry of Social Affairs only allocated 60 million yuan, the fundraising committee needs to raise 54 million yuan to achieve the predetermined goal. To date, only 15 million yuan has been raised (more than 6.5 million yuan from radio fundraising, and more than 8.5 million yuan raised by Du Yuesheng, chairman of the fundraising committee, mobilizing district people's representatives). There is still a shortfall of more than 38 million yuan, which must be raised through ongoing efforts. The fundraising committee is scheduled to hold a dinner party at the Yituan Hotel from the 6th to the 11th of next month. The proceeds from ticket sales are expected to reach 20 million yuan. As for the relief work, in addition to establishing shelters, it will also hold rice and porridge distributions and rescue the poor. At the same time, nearly 2,000 refugees from northern Anhui Province have fled to Shanghai. This committee has consulted with the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan to send each of them a bag of Burmese flour, which will be distributed by the Anhui Association in Shanghai, and the association will be asked to send them back to their hometowns. At the same time, this committee will also give flour to the poor and unemployed comrades who have suffered in the anti-Japanese war and to the families of the martyrs, to provide some relief.</p>
<p>Advocate Saving to Relieve Refugees</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Association to be Established Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Preparations for the Zhejiang Association in Shanghai have been completed. It is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Association of Compatriots in Shanghai on Xizang Road at 1 PM today, to elect directors and supervisors. At the meeting, a monk will give a lecture on the process of the constitutional conference, and Yu Biancheng will lecture on current economic issues.</p>
<h3>Director Zhao of the Social Affairs Bureau Discusses Year-End Bonus Issues: Varying Profit and Loss Situations in Various Industries, Unreasonable to Request Based on Precedent</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhao Banfu, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, received reporters from this newspaper and answered various questions related to year-end bonuses. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The year-end bonus for the six major public utilities in this city has been decided to be one month's salary, and the labor force accepts it without problems. (2) The year-end bonus issue for the silk industry involves 40 factories and more than 10,000 workers. The labor side initially requested a year-end bonus of two months, but the management side was unwilling to consider it at all. After the efforts of the Labor Department, the labor side conceded to the 28th, and the management side conceded to the 6th. Because the profit and loss situation of each factory in the silk industry is different, Zhao suggested that those with surpluses should subsidize those with losses so that they can bear the reasonable minimum year-end bonus. This matter is still being coordinated. (3) If businesses with a surplus voluntarily pay a year-end bonus of more than one month's salary and there is no labor dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau can ignore it. Zhao believes that the profit and loss situation of each industry is very different, and it is unreasonable to request based on precedent. He believes that the double salary method is quite reasonable.</p>
<h3>Pudong Land Administration Fraud Case: Two Suspects Arrested and Detained</h3>

<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Doubts</p>
<p>(1) Believing Slander</p>
<p>Meimeng Zhuang asks: When Poren was eighteen years old, he left home to be independent because he could not bear his stepmother's harsh treatment. Later, because he missed his family, he returned to the courtyard, but unexpectedly, his stepmother relapsed and could not live in peace, so he recently left again. His father was naturally cowardly and believed women's words, claiming that he would publish an announcement to sever his father-son relationship. Although I did not obtain the consent of my parents before leaving home, I did send a letter to my parents afterwards to express my apology and state my reasons, without slandering the family in any way. Moreover, the items I took with me when I left were all personal items and did not take any items from home. Is this statement valid? How should I deal with it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] The father-son relationship is a direct bloodline relationship, and it cannot be severed according to law. If there is an announcement in the newspaper to sever the father-son relationship, it is naturally invalid according to law.</p>
<p>(2) Analyzing Inheritance</p>
<p>Wu Mao asks: (1) A married B and gave birth to ten A, and after B died, he remarried C and gave birth to B. Now both A and B are adults, and A is also dead. Is C A's legal agent and A and B's legal guardian? (2) Does C have the full authority to inherit or dispose of A's estate alone? (3) When analyzing the estate, can C and A and B divide the estate into three shares? After C's death, will the estate be inherited by B? Does A have the right to ask about it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) A is dead, and his stepmother C cannot be A's legal agent. Since both A, the son of A's former wife B, and B, the son of the stepmother, are adults, there is no need for C to be their legal agent or guardian (the "legal guardian" referred to in the letter should mean guardian). (2) C cannot fully investigate and inherit or dispose of all of A's estate alone. (3) A's estate should be divided into three shares: one share each for A, A, and B. A has nothing to do with how C and her son B dispose of their property.</p>
<h3>Finding Someone</h3>
<p>Looking for Lu Changhui: My cousin Lu Changzeng, also named Changzhen, is 21 years old and is from Nanxiang, Jiading. After the 813 Incident, he withdrew westward with the National Army and was stationed in Hengyang and Shaoyang in Hunan Province. Since sending a letter in November 1932, there has been no news.

<p>Looking for Zhu Fusun: A native of Jinze Town, Qingpu County, 27 years old this year. During the Anti-Japanese War, he participated in the New 30th Division 90th Regiment in Yuyao. In May 1932, he transferred to the mainland and was trained at the 4th Branch of the Central Military Academy in Dushan, Guizhou. When he was in military school, he often sent letters home. It was not until August 1933 that contact was lost. After the victory, he wrote to the military school to inquire, but there was no reply. His family is extremely anxious. Kind gentlemen or those who were classmates or comrades with Zhu Fusun, if you know of his whereabouts, please notify Zhu Yangfeng of the Advertising Department of Yuhua Tobacco Company, 272 South Zhongzheng 2nd Road, Shanghai.

<h3>Financial Market is Treacherous: Newly Established Banks Are the First to be Impacted</h3>
<p>Central Bank Officials Express Thoughts</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, the financial market has been turbulent, with particularly sharp rises and falls in gold. However, after the Central Bank repeatedly sold to suppress the market, the market price finally fell. Speculators were the first to be hit. As a result, several newly established banks and money shops suddenly found themselves in a tight position. This was especially true for those with larger outstanding loans or more frequent customer transactions. After being hit, unstable phenomena occurred. Yesterday, there were rumors of as many as six such institutions. Afterwards, they scrambled to make up for the losses or reorganize. This reporter specially visited Gao Yuesheng, deputy director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, to ask about the Central Bank's views on this matter. Gao said: The business operations of the financial industry in this city have always been directly supervised by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. The Central Bank is also extremely concerned about the instability of some banks and money shops. However, most of the newly established banks and money shops are branches of inland banks. The Ministry of Finance regulations stipulate that inland banks that have been established for more than four years and whose business operations are stable may establish branches elsewhere. Currently, there are quite a few inland banks that meet the requirements of these regulations. Therefore, a large number of new banks and money shops have recently appeared in Shanghai. It is found that these banks and money shops often do not have sufficient capital. A large part of the opening costs have already used up all the funds, and they still need to incur some debt. These banks and money shops are often run by outsiders who lack comprehensive planning for banking operations. In addition, banks and money shops in this city usually rely on interbank lending to adjust their own cash positions. Once the financial market fluctuates, all banks and money shops will shrink their cash positions to maintain their own strength. Banks and money shops that rely on interbank lending suddenly lose their support and are bound to experience instability. Furthermore, most of the current deposits in banks and money shops are demand deposits, which are very sensitive and volatile. When the market fluctuates, these deposits become floating funds and flow into the market, speculating on gold and US dollars. Therefore, banks and money shops with less experience, which usually rely on these demand deposits to adjust their cash positions, are easily stranded. The most obvious example is that in the past, the amount of money that each bank needed to make up for occasionally insufficient funds at the clearing house was only tens of millions of yuan per day. Now, it is not uncommon for the difference to reach 200 to 300 million yuan. Therefore, he hopes that after this round of market fluctuations, the financial industry should adopt more stable strategies as its mission for future business operations.</p>
<p>It is also reported that, at this time of year-end approaching, coupled with the gold rush, speculators are fueling the flames. Some have made huge profits, but many have lost control and been swept into the whirlpool. After the Chengda Silver Company stopped exchanging, the Shunli Silver Company announced its liquidation yesterday. In addition, five emerging banks were in a state of tension yesterday due to illiquidity. There were various rumors in the market about the predicament of the above banks. Therefore, the more important banks and money shops are adopting a cautious attitude towards the allocation of funds. In addition, the Central Bank has been selling large amounts of gold for several days, absorbing nearly 100 billion yuan of funds. The money market has suddenly tightened, and the unofficial interest rate has been raised to two cents, but it is still difficult to borrow cash. Therefore, it is generally expected that under the condition of extremely tight money, the price of gold will be difficult to see well, and other prices will gradually return to normal.</p>
<h3>Overnight Interest Rates Soar to Over Three Cents; Gold and Dollar Prices Continue to Plummet</h3>
<p>The red-hot gold market was universally rejected by the financial community yesterday and continued to plummet. It opened at 3.4 million yuan this morning, and briefly rose to 3.43 million yuan after opening, but soon sellers with missing orders from silver and money shops came to sell, and the falling trend started again, breaking the 3.4 million yuan level. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 40 bars at a price of 3.36 million yuan, and after that, people became even more panic, and unstable news spread frequently, breaking the 3.3 million yuan level. The news of the bankruptcy of a certain bank fueled the selling frenzy even more, and there was no end in sight. At noon, it even fell below 3.15 million yuan, and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, there were cash sales at discounted prices in the spot market, seeing a low price of 3.08 million yuan. The forward transaction opened at 3.17 yuan and gradually rose to 3.29 million yuan, but was finally suppressed to around 3.2 million yuan. As a result, it fell another 230,000 yuan compared to the previous close, jewelry gold was 345,000 yuan, and silver dollars also fell. The usual overnight interest rate was around two cents, and the rate for those who needed funds that day soared to over three cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were also affected and slightly lower. The US dollar opened at 6,700 yuan this morning and was sold immediately, and then fell back with the price of gold. At noon, it fell below 6,200 yuan. In the afternoon, it stabilized slightly and hovered between 6,200 yuan and 6,400 yuan. As a result, it fell another 400 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar was sluggish, starting at 1,350 yuan and falling to below 1,25 yuan. As a result, it also fell 120 yuan. Due to the Christmas holiday in Hong Kong, dealers were only willing to supply it at 1,300 yuan. Indian remittance was 1,480 yuan and British remittance was 20,800 yuan, both were selling prices and there were no deals.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds were still supported yesterday, and miscellaneous brands were slightly sluggish. Series C opened this morning at 1,390 yuan, and 360 rooms came to sell, and it fell to as low as 1,330 yuan. Later, because 552 rooms had replenishment, it went back to high as 1,460 yuan, and then turned weak. As a result, Series A, B, and C each rose 30 yuan compared to the previous close, Series D fell 50 yuan, and Series E fell 100 yuan. The turnover was 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Five Securities Firms are Engaging in Illegal Transactions: Ordered to Suspend Business After Investigation</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau is actively cracking down on illegal transactions outside the stock exchange. It is learned that according to a letter from the stock exchange supervisor, the Social Affairs Bureau said that in this city, Cuifeng, Bingji, Yiertai, Xinhua, Taifeng and other securities firms, as well as Bao Cheng Yarn, are illegally trading outside the market. If the Social Affairs Bureau is asked to ban it, it immediately sent staff to investigate with the police station and inspected the account books and transaction conditions. It was found that Taifeng, Cuifeng, Bingji, Santai, Xinhua and other firms did have illegal trading activities. They have been ordered to suspend business yesterday, and the Public Utilities Bureau has been notified to dismantle the telephones of these firms, and all securities firms have been instructed to go to the Social Affairs Bureau to sign a letter of guarantee, stating that they will no longer engage in illegal transactions. It is said that Bao Cheng Yarn, after investigation, has no illegal trading activities, and is only guaranteed by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the sharp decline in gold prices, the purchasing power of customers in the yarn market was weak, and people in the industry were eager to supply and demand. In addition, the allocated yarn from finished product factories was sold at a discounted price, so 20s yarn fell another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. There was little demand for double-strand yarn, and it was even more sluggish, falling 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Second Phase of South Transport Ends at the End of the Month</p>
<p>It is learned that the registration for the second phase of South Transport yarn and cloth started this month. As of the morning of the 24th, about 40 manufacturers were approved for application, totaling 3,857 pieces of cotton yarn and 49,488 pieces of cloth. The total amount of South Transport yarn and cloth approved by the Textile Control Committee this phase is 5,857 pieces of cotton yarn and 125,492 pieces of cotton cloth. It is said that the association will approve the South Transport yarn and cloth applied for by various manufacturers in this phase at the end of this month. If the total amount of South Transport yarn and cloth approved in this phase still has a balance upon the expiration date, it will be combined with the third phase.</p>
<p>Prices for Fourth Phase of Allocated Yarn Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>The textile factory intends to adjust the price of cotton yarn for the fourth allocation of the fourth phase of refurbished products, but the Textile Control Committee has not approved it, so the allocation price must remain at the old price and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>20s Double-Strand Yarn Resumes Listing</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Corporation uses 20s double-strand yarn as the main raw material for sail-making. Since the joint allocation of yarn, this yarn has not been allocated. Now that it has resumed listing, it is specially included, and its price is increased by 12.5% ​​according to the 20s single yarn, at 1,965,000 yuan per piece, and it has been notified to the Refurbished Product Cotton Yarn Distribution Association to notify the industry, starting from the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk: Few Applicants for Fourth Allocation</h3>
<p>The Dyestuffs and Weavers Association previously applied to the China Industrial and Mining Bank for the allocation of artificial silk needed by its members to blend into their finished products. After being approved by the bank, each member was issued an application card, and the association handled the procedures for paying the money and applying for it four times a month. It is learned that the fourth sale of this month is scheduled to start on the 27th, and the deadline for members to pay the money is noon on the 26th. Those who fail to pay by the deadline will be deemed to have voluntarily given up. Currently, 19 companies, including Xinhua, have sent their registration cards to the association, and 46 companies have not. The association has notified all members. According to the person in charge of the company, the members have tight funds as the end of the year approaches, so many of those who have not sent the cards are probably unable to pay.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Plunges Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as Taiwan sugar began to be available for pickup, spot goods suddenly increased, and prices fell sharply. The association divided the current price of white sand in the market to 138,000 to 139,000 yuan, the warehouse receipt was 135,000 to 136,000 yuan, the current price of raw sand was 130,000 yuan to 129,000 yuan, the warehouse receipt was 106,000 to 17,000 yuan, and the current price of each fell by more than 20,000 yuan. Guangbang's [unclear] also fell by 10,000 yuan, to 123,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan, with more than 200 packages opened. Shandang's Tizhuang Qing was 125,000 yuan, and dozens of packages were traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Review Committee Resolves that Negotiated Price of Sugar Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Sugar Review Committee held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 PM yesterday. There were three important decisions: (1) The negotiated price of sugar remains unchanged, i.e., 130,000 yuan per [unclear] for medium sand and 110,000 yuan per dan for raw sand. (2) In order to adjust supply and demand, it is stipulated that those who purchase raw sand must also purchase the same amount of medium sand; but those who only buy medium sand do not need to purchase raw sand at the same time. (3) For the first allocation of sugar, the surplus certificates and insufficient sugar certificates in each district were previously under the overall control of the Civil Affairs Office. Now, because the procedures are too troublesome, it has been decided to change the method; that is, those with certificates of surplus will have them cancelled by the Civil Affairs Office and handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration. Also, sugar prices fluctuated once last week. In order to lower the market price, Taiwan Sugar Company had a particularly large allocation in the 28th phase, totaling 28,500 bags of medium sand, 650 bags of group sand, 3,300 bags of white car essence, 2,000 bags of white car honey, 20,350 bags of raw sand, and 700 bags of red sand, for a total of 55,500 bags. Compared with the 17,550 bags in the 27th phase, it exceeded by a lot, and sugar prices became stable again.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Encounter Another Difficult Situation; Falling Trend Pervades the Entire Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere of terror surrounding Chinese stocks intensified. Market conditions could not be sustained, and they plummeted severely. The morning opened low, with issues #199, #215, #142, #122, #61 unsold after the opening. Deyong Yarn even fell below $625. Subsequently, the gold market stabilized slightly, and issues #76, #224, #145, #4, #154, #47 advanced, briefly recovering to $657. After 10:15 AM, the gold market weakened again, and issues #89, #83, #85, #229, #99, #61 were sold off. Issue #232 and #198 were acquired midway through but could not overcome the continuous decline in gold prices. A certain bank declared bankruptcy due to a loss of one billion yuan. Issues #229, #233, #83, #154 were sold again. Issue #99 and #28 frantically dumped spot yarn, finally breaking through the $600 mark. Now, Qinxing first declared a limit-down. Xintai, Jinglun, and Meiya also successively fell to their limit, causing further panic. The gold market aided the decline. Near noon, Deyong Yarn briefly saw a low price of $585. After issues #14 and #47 came in to buy, the afternoon close stabilized. Compared to the previous close, Deyong Yarn, Jingfu, Xingguanghua all fell by about 10%, Meiya, Xinyi, and Qinxing fell by 50%, Tejiaodeyong Yarn, and Jingfu fell 10%, Meiya and Huatong fell slightly more than 5%, Xinyi and Xingguang fell 15%. There were few cold stocks trading, and Jinglun alone fell by 50%. The afternoon session opened with gold prices plummeting to within 3.1 million. Issues #186 and #215 were both sold, and Deyong Yarn fell to $575. Issues #124 and #212 came in to buy, and the gold market saw an increase, recovering to over $610. Issues #218 and #215 were both sold. Although there was a low rebound, due to the lack of settlement for issues #177, #224, and #169, it rose again to $616. Before long, the gold market fell again, and issues #145, #89, #229, #99, #16, #171 were successively sold off. Now, Deyong Yarn retreated again to around $580. Issue #76 was acquired near the close, stabilizing slightly after the low. As a result, compared to the previous close, Deyong Yarn and Xinyi fell slightly more than 10%, Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Xingguang fell 15%, Huatong fell slightly more than 5%. Trading in cold stocks was quiet, with very few transactions. Yongan fell slightly less than 20%, Jinglun was slightly less than 50%, Datong rose slightly, and the rest all fell. Tejiaodeyong Yarn fell 10%, and Huazhuan fell slightly more than 5%, while the rest fell slightly less than 15%. Off-market stocks showed a slight decline.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks fell further yesterday, but investors provided some support at low prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha, Yinglian, and Huidexin each fell slightly less than 10%, while the rest all fell by about 5%.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials Can Only Last for a Month at Most; Silk Reeling Industry Will Halt Production Entirely; Hoping the Government Will Provide Subsidized Loans to Seek Relief Quickly</h3>
<p>Chu Fucheng, Chairman of the Silk Reeling Industry Association, met with reporters yesterday, stating: (1) The association has over 150 members in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. However, currently, fewer than 50 factories are formally operating, and the raw materials of the operating factories can only last for a month at most. Around the end of the lunar year, all factories will halt production entirely to wait for the new cocoons to be available in May of next year before resuming operations. This is the main threat to the current weaving industry. (2) During this trip to the capital, he obtained the personal approval of Chairman Chiang, in addition to the current general relief measures, it is also planned to include a silk reeling industry subsidy in the government's budget for the next year because the export of silk has a significant impact on the government's foreign exchange and the livelihoods of silkworm farmers. Currently, our silk is losing one-third of its value per dan in the American market due to competition with cheap Japanese goods. Therefore, if the government does not provide subsidies, the entire silk reeling industry will collapse. (3) Regarding the government's relief for the silk reeling industry, the Executive Yuan has ordered the Zhongcan Company to negotiate with the Central Bank to increase the purchase price of autumn silk. There is currently no final decision, but it is around 60,000 yuan per dan. Zhongcan Company has allocated the last batch of autumn cocoons to various factories for reeling on their behalf to maintain the livelihoods of workers. As for the loan issue, in addition to establishing a reeling worker loan, providing 1.4 million yuan per dan, the loan for machinery and equipment, using reeling machines as collateral, and lending 2 million yuan is still under negotiation. (4) The prosperity and decline of the silk reeling industry are greatly related to the entire national economy. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the government can start with improving silkworm breeds and cocoon quality and assist various silk factories in purchasing the latest machinery and equipment in large quantities because Japanese machines can reel one dan of silk from 300 catties of cocoons, while Chinese native cocoons require 600 catties to reel one dan of silk. At the same time, thoroughly improving mechanical equipment can not only increase the amount of silk produced and improve silk quality but also reduce the cost of silk production. Only in this way can we compete with Japanese silk in the international market, and only in this way can we truly improve the entire silk reeling industry.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Plan to Petition Again; Requesting the Government to Purchase Tea</h3>
<p>Local tea merchants, in view of the approaching end of the year, and the government's measures for purchasing tea have not yet been announced and implemented, are currently discussing emergency relief measures and have unanimously decided to send representatives to petition again. Twenty-one representatives from all tea-producing areas in the country have been sent to participate, led by Jingquan, the former general manager of the China Tea Company. It is reported that various parties are currently discussing the date of going to the capital. According to semi-official sources, the Central Trust Bureau has finalized the principles for purchasing tea, starting with green tea, of which Tunlv accounts for 70% and Pingshui green tea accounts for 30%. The tea purchase standards are currently being studied.</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of the Import Industry; Foreign Goods Ordered Previously Cannot Be Imported by the Deadline; Requesting the Import and Export Control Commission to Handle with Flexibility</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Import Trade", the Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association has faced the situation that various foreign goods ordered by members cannot be delivered due to lack of preparation beforehand and no remedy afterward. Regarding goods ordered before the announcement of the amended measures on the 17th of last month, the Import and Export Control Commission notified various merchants to ship all goods to the port by the end of February next year. Upon hearing this news, various merchants panicked. According to Zhou Jingwei, the secretary of the association, a portion of the goods previously ordered by various members is piled up at foreign coastal docks, currently waiting to be loaded onto ships. Another portion is still at inland ports in the United States. Due to the lengthy US seafarers' strike, all docks were piled high with goods ordered from various countries, and warehouses were unable to accommodate them. Although maritime transport has now resumed, it will still take several months to transport all these materials. As for materials that have not yet reached coastal docks, it is even more impossible. It is practically impossible to ship the goods to Shanghai by the end of February as required by the Import and Export Control Commission. In addition to continuing to convene meetings with various members to discuss the issue, it is also planned to request the Import and Export Control Commission to understand the merchants' suffering and provide appropriate solutions.</p>
<h3>India Doubles or Increases by Two and a Half Times Spring Cotton Export Quota</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The Indian government has recently issued export licenses for 500,000 bales of cotton with a staple length of 11/16 inch and below for export during the January-April period. For exports to all countries except the United States during the export period ending December 1946, merchants will be issued additional licenses for a quantity equal to 2.5 times the amount approved by the end of this year, regardless of whether they have already received them or not. As for licenses for the United States, additional licenses will be issued for a quantity equal to the amount approved during the period ending 1946. In addition, the quota allocated to the United Nations for the January-April period has been set at 125,000 bales. The urgent need to increase cloth production was discussed at a meeting of the Shanghai Fifth and Sixth Spinning and Weaving Administration. The possibility of adopting a three-shift system in various central areas was also discussed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Business Resumption Loans; Lending Has Begun in Burma; Preparation Still Underway in the Philippines and Siam</h3>
<p>The government is providing business resumption loans to help overseas Chinese revive their businesses overseas. The Bank of Communications is responsible for handling the loans in Burma and the Philippines, with a total loan amount of US$5 million for each region. It is learned that lending has already begun in Burma, while preparations are still underway in the Philippines. However, due to the losses incurred during the Pacific War, Burma has not yet recovered, and society has not yet stabilized. Therefore, the general business recovery still needs time. Very few loans have been used. The amount currently loaned out by the Bank of Communications in Rangoon is very small, mostly for mortgage loans secured by real estate. As for the Philippines, because the loans require certification from our consulates, procedures are still being processed. According to news from the Bank of Communications, the Philippine branch has reserves waiting to be loaned out at any time. However, according to general observation, the loan limit this time is too small, with credit loans limited to US$1,000 per household and mortgage loans limited to US$10,000. The benefit to large businesses is not significant. At the same time, overseas Chinese in the Philippines are relatively wealthy and can generally order goods from the United States on credit, and the interest rates for borrowing from foreign banks are extremely low. It is expected that the number of loans issued in the future will not be large. The Bank of China is handling the business resumption loans in the Indochina region, totaling US$2.5 million. The bank has sent personnel to Siam to prepare and negotiate with the local authorities in that country, as well as negotiate through diplomatic channels to overcome the obstacles of Siam's foreign exchange control. In Vietnam, due to the conflict between France and Vietnam, the Hanoi office of the Bank of China has moved to Saigon and will begin operations once the situation improves slightly.</p>
<h3>Processing and Exporting of Domestic Silk; Organizing a Joint Venture Company; Capital of 500 Million Yuan to Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The processing and export of domestic silk is becoming increasingly concrete. The silk weaving industry in this city has decided to form a joint production and sales company, with capital set at 500 million yuan. All silk factories can subscribe to shares, and national banks are also welcome to invest. It is hoped that the preparations for the company can be completed before the end of the old year. In the future, it is planned to send personnel to various overseas markets to directly obtain connections without relying on foreign firms for sales. The issue of being responsible for profits and losses has been resolved after several consultations. Various factories have agreed to bear the risks themselves, but losses will be limited to 90% of the "labor cost", and the sales proceeds exceeding the agreed price will also be used as profits for the factories.</p>
<h3>Silk Weakens Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market generally showed signs of weakness, with few transactions. Rayon 120, Gaoshan, was initially bid at 290,000 to 300,000 yuan, with some transactions. Dongyang brand was priced at 420,000 yuan. There was not much change in the afternoon, down by 140,000 to 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss persisted in high prices due to a shortage of goods, while glossy 150 was even more expensive. Jin San Ma small boxes Lishengchang bid at 5 million yuan, and six boxes were bid at 4.7 million yuan in the market. Raw silk was generally weak. B-grade was traded at 5.125 million yuan, and CD-grade had no opening transactions. Opening goods were priced at 4.85 million yuan, more than 100,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Silk fabrics also showed weakness due to the decline in raw materials. Huajin crepe was bid at 750 yuan, but only traded at 700 yuan later. There were no other notable changes.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Galls</h3>
<p>It is reported that there is a severe shortage of galls in this port. Various export firms are directly purchasing from Hankou, transporting them to Shanghai for selection, and then shipping them for export. It is said that local Shanghai native product merchants are selling to export firms, with the price for delivery in Shanghai being 120,000 yuan per large package (i.e., net weight of one Sima dan), but there is a quoted price without any transactions.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Jewelry Tightens Again</h3>
<p>The price of gold and silver jewelry is similar to that in Macau and Hong Kong, and the price has been rising. In the market yesterday, high-quality goods opened at 310,000 yuan, and ordinary goods opened at 280,000 to 245,000 yuan. Because the inventory base is not sufficient, and now it is the peak season for winter sales, the trend is very strong.</p>
<h3>Hua Tea Exported to French Territories; Negotiations Have Shown Some Progress</h3>
<p>Chinese tea has always occupied a considerable position in various European and American countries, especially in French Africa. Currently, there is a demand for Chinese tea abroad, but the selling price there has not yet reached the production cost in our country, so exports are still limited by price. Tea merchants in this city, in view of the fact that Chinese tea is on the verge of extinction, have repeatedly appealed to the government, requesting relief, or purchasing at cost, but so far there has been no concrete development. It is learned that Mr. Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank's business department has discussed the various difficulties of Chinese tea with the French economic envoys for several months. As a result, several hundred tons have been satisfactorily resolved. It is said that most of them are high-quality teas such as Zhenmei. Currently, the tea samples have been deemed qualified, and the selling price has also been slightly increased compared to the past. It has also been designated to be shipped to various French territories one after another. Therefore, various export firms in this city have gradually become active, but the market is still unstable, and there is no vitality in the domestic sales of red and green tea.</p>
<h3>Shipments Coming One After Another; Cigarettes Decline Weakly</h3>
<p>Cigarette sales are gradually being delivered, but buyers are watching and the market is weak. The market opened softly yesterday and then gradually declined. Ten Great Britain cigarettes per carton are down another 110,000 yuan. Only 20 per carton of Qianmen, Taishan, and Sanwang are slightly better, while the rest are all declining.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Postponement of Payment Order; Difficult to Cancel at Present; Transfer of Stock Ban; May Be Partially Lifted</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 24th] Colonial Affairs Minister Dudd, in response to a question from a member of the Legislative Council, stated that the government is not prepared to immediately cancel the Postponement of Payment Order promulgated since Hong Kong's recovery. He said that the government could not make further statements on the issue of the Postponement of Payment Order and the relationship between debtors and creditors. Although there is no immediate hope for the cancellation of the Postponement of Payment Order, the possibility of canceling property transactions during the Japanese occupation is being researched and considered by the Colonial Affairs Bureau. Dudd continued: "Regarding the possibility of partially lifting the ban on stock trading, the State Council has also been requested to implement a system so that stocks of companies registered by owners with the competent authorities can be freely traded, but stocks of companies with disputes are naturally not included." Many merchants believe that the Postponement of Payment Order is somewhat hindering Hong Kong's economic recovery, and some parties have urged the government to cancel the ban as soon as possible. Under the Postponement of Payment Order, all stock transactions must first be approved by the Minister of Finance, and disputes over debts cannot be brought to court. The Postponement of Payment Order does not give banks the power to unfreeze pre-war accounts. The local stock exchange is still continuing to reorganize, and there is little possibility of resuming operations until at least the ban is partially lifted.</p>
<h3>Trade Sluggish; Coal Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Coal trade was sluggish yesterday, with buyers watching. Sales of all grades were stagnant. The price of Yanbai coal frequently declined. Tangquan lump coal fell by 50,000 yuan, and Jiaozuo lump coal fell sharply by 70,000 yuan. Yantai lump coal and Zhongkuang, and high-quality Zhongkuang bituminous coal all showed a slight decline. Firewood charcoal briquettes did not change.</p>
<h3>Australian Trade Representative; Welcomes Indian Goods to Be Sold to Australia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Delhi, 24th] Mitcham, leader of the Australian trade delegation stationed in India, said: "Australian trade was previously monopolized by the Japanese, and we sincerely hope that India can restore its inherent position in the future." He assured that Australia will do its best to assist in the development of Indian trade.</p>

<h3>Border Education Work of the Ministry of Education in the Last Three Years</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing] The Border Education Committee held its fourth meeting in Chongqing in January 1934. In 1935, due to the victory and repatriation, the fifth meeting was not convened. During these three years, the country once entered its most difficult era, and the Ministry of Education's border education facilities had to adapt to the situation, endure hardships, and gradually seek development. In general, before the Japanese surrender, the government was strategizing for the Allied counteroffensive, and military needs were urgent, so border education was greatly restricted. For example, the Lanzhou Language Training Class of the Border Administration College could not be established. However, border education is of great importance to national defense, so the Ministry of Education still did its best within the limits of its human and financial resources. In addition to the Maritime School, the Lama Vocational School, and the Border Administration Department of the Central and Northwestern Universities being established as planned, efforts were also made to improve the quality of existing schools. After the victory and repatriation, border education became even more difficult. The maintenance of funding for various border schools in the rear area, the settlement of teachers' lives, and the supply of teaching materials and equipment could not be interrupted. The repatriation work in the recovered areas needed to be coordinated with the development of the new situation in the border areas and quickly promoted. The sixth meeting will open on the 26th, and the Ministry of Education has prepared a report on the border education facilities of the past three years for the sixth meeting, as follows:</p>
<p>Directly Managed Undertakings (1) Colleges and Middle Schools: In addition to the original Border School, the Ministry of Education established a Maritime School in 1934 in response to the need to recover the southeast coast. Recently, in response to the request of the local authorities in Xikang, it is planned to change the Kangding Normal School in the province into a normal college and is currently awaiting instructions from the Executive Yuan. In terms of middle schools, in addition to the Huangchuan and Hexi Middle Schools, which were once converted into border education, there is now only the Yimeng Middle School. (2) Normal Education: There were originally ten normal schools in the border areas, three in Tibet, two each in Xikang and Gansu, and one each in Guizhou, Qinghai, Ningxia, and a normal class attached to Yimeng Middle School. Recently, in response to the needs of the recovered areas, normal schools have been established in Rehe, Chahar, Liaobei, and Xinghua. The Tianshan Congling Normal School in Xinjiang is also being prepared. The academic system of normal schools has changed slightly since 1935, and the length of study has been uniformly changed to four years. (3) Vocational Education: There are eight vocational schools in the border areas, two each in Qinghai, Xikang, and Sichuan, and one each in Gansu and Ningxia. The departments are diverse and mostly established according to local conditions: some focus on animal husbandry, some on agriculture and forestry, some on both agriculture and animal husbandry, some specialize in textiles, and there are also settings for medical affairs, veterinary medicine, and agricultural and livestock product manufacturing, all based on local construction needs. In terms of the length of study, there are two, three, four, and five years, which are also determined based on the special circumstances of the locality. In order to determine the academic system of vocational schools in the border areas, the Ministry of Education has stipulated that all junior vocational schools in the border areas should be changed to a four-year system, and the curriculum standards are being drafted. (4) Elementary Education: The number of elementary schools established in Suiyuan, Ningxia, Xikang, and Tibet has reached 17. Including affiliated elementary schools, there are a total of 34 schools. (5) Social Education: The Ministry of Education has always had various schools concurrently run social education in the border areas. Each year, the Ministry allocates radios, projectors, and other equipment and orders the schools to organize mobile teaching drama troupes to teach in various border areas. Other extension activities, such as running literacy schools for the public and opening clinics, have also achieved considerable results in some schools.</p>
<p>Local Border Education (1) Provinces in the Rear Area: Various provinces have a considerable history of implementing border education, but in the past, they inevitably acted independently, and the results they showed were also different. In order to meet the needs of the border areas, the Ministry of Education has formulated a three-year plan (1934 to 1936) for various border provinces to promote border education, and has set standards for elementary schools, social education, and vocational education, ordering them to formulate and implement plans within the scope of funding and personnel possibilities. Provinces that have formulated plans include Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xikang. Due to special circumstances, Suiyuan and Qinghai only formulated plans for 1935. Guizhou and Guangxi reported that there was no need to implement border education separately. Since education in Xinjiang is almost entirely within the scope of border education, only educational administrative plans have been formulated. In terms of implementation results, the various border provinces have generally worked hard in the design and implementation of border education. Among them, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xikang have achieved better results due to more abundant funding and personnel. The situation in Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Suiyuan is the opposite. However, Mongolian banner local education is facing difficulties in funding and teachers. The elementary schools established in various banners are crude and simple, and there is much room for improvement. There are no secondary schools. The Ministry of Education has allocated border education subsidies to various border provinces over the years to encourage them. In 1935, the subsidies for public and private schools in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xikang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, and Chahar totaled 2,294,000 yuan, which increased to 13,990,400 yuan this year, directly allocated to various schools for use. (2) Border Provinces in the Recovered Area: During the enemy's occupation, a large number of schools were established in the Northeast, Rehe, Chahar, and Mongolian banner areas to implement slave education and poison our border compatriots. At the time of repatriation, the reception was delayed due to the impact of the war, causing education in the area to be suspended. In order to encourage local schools to be established and quickly complete the repatriation work, the Ministry of Education has specifically promulgated the "Key Points of Emergency Measures for Banner Education" and ordered them to be implemented, stipulating that all local primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in the recovered areas that have had considerable achievements in the past and have no difficulties in teaching in the future should be restored by the provincial or alliance banner government within the scope of personnel and funding. In terms of funding, the Ministry has successively listed provisions for repatriation subsidies: a subsidy of 3 million yuan for senior high schools, 2 million yuan for junior high schools, 1 million yuan for complete elementary schools (the same for social education institutions), and 600,000 yuan for junior elementary schools. In terms of teachers, qualified personnel should be hired, or existing teachers should be given short-term special training and assigned to various schools. In addition, the Li people's education on Hainan Island in Guangdong and the mountain tribe education in Taiwan have also been ordered by the Ministry of Education to be planned and promoted by the Guangdong and Taiwan provinces.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling to Return to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Tianjin, 25th] Zhang Boling is scheduled to return to Tianjin on the 27th or 28th. Nankai is preparing a grand welcome. It is said that after Zhang returns here, he does not intend to leave Tianjin in the short term and will devote all his efforts to school affairs.</p>
<h3>Peking University Professors Urge the Government to Improve Treatment as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Proposing to Subsidize One Ton of Coal Per Person</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] Professors at universities in the north are facing a situation where they are either freezing or starving because the school cannot provide coal for the cold winter. Peking University's administrative meeting yesterday discussed this matter for three hours, but there was no good solution. They can only urge the government to improve treatment as soon as possible and propose to subsidize one ton of coal per person to alleviate the immediate crisis.</p>
<h3>Crisis in Overseas Chinese Education in Siam: Siamese Ministry of Education Orders Registration of Overseas Chinese Schools, Schools Unanimously Reject the Requirement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th] Overseas Chinese schools here have unanimously passed a resolution opposing registration with the Siamese Ministry of Education. If the Siamese authorities refuse to amend the current education regulations promulgated by the former dictator Luang Phibunsongkhram's government, the Overseas Chinese schools are prepared to close. The Ministry of Education recently ordered all Overseas Chinese schools to register within fifteen days. Upon receiving the news, leaders of the Overseas Chinese education community convened a meeting and resolved that the Overseas Chinese schools would only register after the current Siamese education regulations are amended in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty. The treaty stipulates freedom of education for Overseas Chinese children here. Under the current Siamese education regulations, Overseas Chinese teachers must pass the fourth-grade Siamese language examination. Overseas Chinese school authorities stated that Overseas Chinese children aged seven to fourteen are only allowed five and a half hours of Chinese language classes per week, and all Chinese textbooks must be submitted to the Siamese authorities for approval and translated into Siamese. The Overseas Chinese education authorities have decided to make the following requests: (1) At least twelve hours of Chinese language classes per week. (2) Overseas Chinese teachers who do not teach Siamese language classes should be exempt from the Siamese language examination. (3) It is deemed unnecessary to translate Chinese textbooks for approval. These requests are the same as the demands recently made by our embassy in Siam to the Siamese authorities to negotiate amendments to the Siamese education regulations. It is understood that if the above requests are rejected, the Overseas Chinese schools are prepared to close.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Education Department Submits to Provincial Government for Approval and Allocation: 60 Million Yuan for Cultural Relics Restoration, Search and Purchase of Manuscripts and Historical Materials of Revolutionary Martyrs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] The Provincial Education Department has obtained 60 million yuan for cultural relics restoration from the Ministry of Education.

These funds are specifically for searching and purchasing the Guangya Series and important secret manuscript versions, historical materials related to Guangzhou, manuscripts of revolutionary martyrs, local chronicles, and other academic classics. The remaining 20 million yuan will be distributed to various counties and cities, also specifically for searching and purchasing the above-mentioned cultural relics, and may not be used for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Education Formulates New Education Bills</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese Ministry of Education, in order to reform the education system, has formulated five important bills that will soon be submitted to the Diet for deliberation: (1) Basic Law of Education, (2) Education Law, (3) Social Education Law, (4) Private School Corporation Law, (5) Teacher Status Law.</p>

The audience was still extremely crowded, and by 1:00 PM, there were no empty seats, with a total of no less than ten thousand people. Boy Scouts from the Private Jinghu Middle School were present to maintain order, and the association dispatched a large number of officers to provide directions, so the order was well maintained. The schools participating in the Victory Grand Chorus yesterday were the Third District Center, Fifth District First Center, Fifth District Second Center, Eleventh District Center, Twelfth District Center, Fifteenth District Center, Nineteenth District Center, Xinsheng, Danhua, Feihong, Xicheng, Singapore, and eleven other schools.

All of the above programs were filmed by photographers dispatched by the Central Photography Studio to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3>Departments of Fudan University Compete to Establish Academic Lectures</h3>
<p>Recently, Fudan University students have become increasingly interested in academic research. This is largely due to the efforts of the Chinese Literature Department of the school. Since the launch of the Literary Lecture series organized by the department, other departments have also become active. Yesterday, there were two lectures at the school: one by Mr. , our ambassador to the Netherlands, on "European Issues," invited by the Political Science Department; and another by Professor Gao Juefu on "New Psychological Research Techniques," invited by the Psychology Department. It is heard that this Friday afternoon, the Chinese Literature Department will again invite Professors Zhang Jin and Zhou Yutong to lecture at the Literary Lecture series, and the Political Science Department will invite Mr. Xu Weinan to lecture on "Prospects for the Press."

<h3>Teaching Hours for Secondary School Teachers</h3>
<p>Strictly Limited by Municipal Bureau of Education</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Education's policy for secondary education in the future will focus on qualitative improvement, strictly limiting the number of concurrent teaching positions held by teachers and the number of students per grade, in order to improve teaching effectiveness. Yesterday, the bureau stipulated that from 1947, teachers in secondary schools in this city must not teach more than 30 hours per week, and the number of students per grade must be reduced as much as possible, in order to comply with the secondary school regulations promulgated by the ministry. An order will soon be issued to all public and private secondary schools in the city to comply.</p>

On the 26th, there will be two singles matches: Bromwich (Aus) vs. Schroeder (USA), Pails (Aus) vs. Kramer (USA). On the 27th, there will be one doubles match, the lineup of which has not yet been announced. On the 28th, there will be two singles matches: Bromwich vs. Kramer, Pails vs. Schroeder. Australian fans believe that the USA's decision to field Kramer and Schroeder is actually advantageous to Australia. The USA's Davis Cup captain's failure to select Parker to partner with Kramer is a mistake, as Parker has Davis Cup finals experience, while Schroeder is a newcomer. However, the USA's lineup also has its advantages. In the recent Victoria Lawn Tennis Championships, Schroeder defeated Pails in the semi-finals, but lost to Bromwich in the finals. In the Davis Cup singles, Schroeder may win one match. Kramer's skills are above Schroeder's, and he should be able to defeat Pails. If so, the USA can win two matches. Kramer is the USA champion, and Bromwich is an Australian international. The two are evenly matched. If Kramer wins, then the USA will win three out of five matches. However, the Australian team has the home advantage, so it is difficult to assess the outcome.</p>

<h3>Jinan Twenty-Four Hours</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Fan Litian</p>
<p>Air Dispatch on the 20th</p>
<p>After the plane landed in Jinan, the first things that caught my eye were the countless strong fortifications and bunkers surrounding the airport. The airport covers an area of four square kilometers. Two days ago, (when the Jiaoji Railway had not yet officially opened) this was the only transportation line connecting Jinan with the outside world. More than six thousand airplanes have successively transported officials and soldiers of all levels, supplies, material or spiritual, ensuring its safety, making this wide fifty-kilometer isolated city with a population of 800,000 able to avoid great disasters and stand tall despite being surrounded by the Communists' hard and soft attacks. The person who bears the most difficult task is General Zhao Ziliang, the current Deputy Adjutant of the Buffer Zone, the right-hand man of Commander Wang Zuomin.</p>
<p>Introducing Two Generals, Deputy Commander Li Xianzhu of the Pacification Zone</p>
<p>General Zhao and General Wu Litian are old acquaintances of this reporter. As early as during the August 13th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War, we hit it off and became the most intimate friends on the battlefield. This time, they knew that I was coming to Jinan, and due to their warm hospitality, I truly felt "at home away from home" and "meeting an old friend in a foreign land," which made me deeply appreciate the warmth and depth of friendship.</p>
<p>Generals Zhao and Wu first introduced me to Deputy Commander Li Xianzhu of the Pacification Zone, Chief of Staff Luo Xingli, and Director Long Zhouyun, and other senior officials. Deputy Commander Li is a famous general from the first class of Whampoa Military Academy, one of the "Three Lis of Shandong" (the other two are Li Yannian and Li Yutang). He is tall, with a round face, radiant, and full of vigor, but his temples are already slightly gray, which shows how hard he worked for the country during the Anti-Japanese War. He personally participated in the famous battles of Xinkou in Shanxi and Fuyang in Anhui, writing glorious chapters in the history of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Deputy Corps Commander Ma Talks, A Whole Set of Whampoa Anecdotes</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when Li and others invited the reporter to a meal. During the meal, we talked about the Communist rebellion in Shandong, from "expert in foreign wars, expert in internal wars," and then Deputy Corps Commander Ma Zhichao, who was also a senior member of the first class from Guanzhong, talked about the interesting anecdotes when he first applied to Whampoa Military Academy. He recounted frankly and candidly: He initially felt that he had no chance of being accepted because his level was too poor, so before the exam, he first visited the Principal (i.e., Chairman Chiang), and explained that military schools are different from general schools, and applicants from remote provinces should be accepted leniently. Chairman Chiang agreed to his request and wrote on his report: "Approved for special admission." When the exam came, Mr. Wang Boling was the chief examiner. Before the exam, Mr. Wang first announced three rules: those who believe they have the ability should take the exam, and those who don't should leave on their own. Cheating is absolutely not allowed, and the admission standards are based on performance. Personal connections and lobbying are invalid. At that time, more than a dozen people voluntarily left the examination hall and gave up the exam. At that time, Ma was not moved at all. When he took the physics and chemistry exams, Ma could not answer a single question and handed in a blank paper. He was deeply afraid of failing, so he had to write to Wang Boling, expressing his grievances and then threatening him: "If I am not accepted, I will have to risk my life." Wang was timid, and as a result, he was indeed accepted!</p>
<p>Cannon Wang Boling Scared People Out of Their Wits</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, Ma still cannot help but laugh at the past. Deputy Commander Li also added: "Wang Boling is known as 'Cannon Wang,' but although he is called a cannon, he is the most timid. Wang once said to people: 'People call me a cannon, and I am indeed a cannon,' but as soon as I hear a cannon sound, I get scared out of my wits!" The whole room roared with laughter.</p>
<p>Ma is good at rhetoric and humorous. He also talked about how when he was a regiment commander in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), he and his classmate Chen Defa went to see Chairman Chiang. After Chairman Chiang invited them to dinner, Ma was deeply afraid of staying too long or having shortcomings that would be discovered by Chairman Chiang, so he immediately asked Chairman Chiang what instructions he had for them in leading troops to fight. Chairman Chiang thought for a moment and then said: "The problem with you two leading troops is Chen Defa's name, which is not 'Defa' ('Obtaining Method')." After Ma left, he complained greatly to Chen Defa, saying that if it wasn't for his name, Chairman Chiang might not have thought of this "comment." Chen is now the garrison commander of Dihua (Urumqi), which can be said to be "Defa" now.</p>
<p>After the meal, Deputy Commander Li and others were busy with meetings, so this reporter invited Mr. Wu, Deputy Director of the Shandong Public Newspaper, and others to visit the six newspapers, six news agencies, and six periodicals here. In addition to the Central News Agency, the news agencies here, such as Chunqiu News Agency, can also send articles daily, making it difficult for the newspaper's field staff to "compete." The circulation of the newspapers ranges from three thousand to more than ten thousand copies. In Jinan, which is like a besieged city, under the circumstances where all material conditions are lacking, it truly symbolizes the struggling spirit of the news industry.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Diligent in Government Affairs, Only Sleeps Four Hours a Day</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, Chairman Wang Zuomin invited me to a banquet. Since Wang took over as the chairman of the provincial government, he has been so busy that he can only sleep four hours a day, and even in these limited four hours, he is often disturbed by the telephone. It has been six years since we last met. My first impression is that although Wang is hardworking, under the arduous task of Shandong's safety resting on his shoulders, his eyes are still bright and his body is strong, as in the past, which shows that the prerequisite for establishing great achievements is not only possessing knowledge, benevolence, and courage, but also a strong physique is the prerequisite among the prerequisites. Although Chairman Wang is now entrusted with important responsibilities by the country, his sincerity and honesty in treating people, and his seriousness and meticulousness in handling affairs, and his traditional work ethic of striving for progress have not changed slightly due to his high position. During the banquet, Chairman Wang mentioned that when we first met, he was only a division commander, but in the past ten years, this reporter is still just a reporter. Compared with him, how can I not be ashamed? However, Chairman Wang still maintains his past style of being frank, sincere, and caring, which is the only thing that is worth comforting for a reporter.</p>
<p>Four Dishes and a Soup, Receiving the Reporter During Mealtime</p>
<p>Because Chairman Wang is too busy, he can only use mealtime to receive the reporter. The meal is four dishes and a soup. Today, because there are also ten people present, including Deputy Army Commander Li Yan, the plates and bowls are larger, with four more plates of porridge and side dishes. Everyone eats comfortably and practically. In the middle of the meal, Chairman Wang asked me many questions about the situation in Beijing and Shanghai, which made me have no time to ask him about the military and political situation in Shandong. At the end of the meal, Secretary-General Liu Daokang of the provincial government had been waiting in the reception room for a long time, so the reporter had to reschedule to ask Chairman Wang to explain the current situation in Shandong.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's residence is the old German consulate in Jinan. When the reporter stepped into his residence in the deep night, the streets were bustling with people, and the night markets in the shops were also the same as in the past. Except for the fortresses at the street corners and the iron barbed wire fences every tens or hundreds of steps on the road, and the iron barbed wire wooden frames that can be electrified standing under the bright street lights, revealing a little bit of wartime atmosphere, the entire city of Jinan is still lying quietly at the foot of Sili Mountain and Saddle Mountain.</p>
<p>The Jinan I encountered in twenty-four hours was really too little. Let's take this as a wedge for future correspondence.</p>
<p>Qingdao Soldiers' Building (Special Correspondent Hang Zhou)</p>
<h3>Abundance on the Shores of Poyang Lake</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo</p>
<p>Poyang, 6th</p>
<p>French economist Gide said: "The wealth of a living individual, that is, the wealth of an animal body, is its blood, while the wealth of a social body is things." Things refer to agricultural products, because agricultural products can draw external extraction, which can increase the wealth of the social body. In other words: when a country, a province, a county, or a township has the wealth of a social body, then the economy and taxes of that country, province, county, or township have laid its source and foundation.</p>
<p>The reserves of agricultural crops in the counties along Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi truly possess the conditions for the above-mentioned social wealth. Together with the five major tributary basins of the Gan River, Fu River, Xiu River, Xin River, and Rao River, it can be said to be the pride of Jiangxi's production sector and the granary of agricultural products in the entire province. In the southeastern provinces, Jiangxi is known as a rich area, which relies on Poyang Lake and the five major production areas of Gan, Fu, Xiu, Xin, and Rao rivers as its strongest pillars.</p>
<p>Today, this reporter will make a brief report on the production and sales of the most prominent crops this year in the counties along Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi, such as rice, indigo, sugarcane, lotus seeds, cotton, and tobacco: but when I started writing this dispatch, the magnificent lake was deeply imprinted in my mind, containing a lot of envy - envious of its ability to breed so many clothing and food materials that are beneficial to human life. Therefore, for each product along the lake, I will specifically mention its function and purpose, not just call it by its category, so as to match the lake water, which is both dynamic and static, and further highlight its endless greatness.</p>
<p>Southeastern Granary, Famine Years Without Hearing of Empty Stomachs</p>
<p>The counties of Rao River, Chang River, and Le River in northern Jiangxi are adjacent to Poyang Lake, with fertile plains and convenient irrigation, making them the most suitable areas for cultivation. As the saying goes: "When Jiangxi is ripe, the Southeast is sufficient." This statement is indeed correct. According to the Jiangxi General Records: In the early Qing Dynasty, there were more than 47,827,000 mu of paddy fields in the entire province. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Statistics Office of the Legislative Yuan estimated that there were more than 41,630,000 mu of paddy fields in the entire province. The Economic Commission of the provincial government estimated that there were 52,000,000 mu of farmland in the entire province, of which paddy fields accounted for an average of 65%. The annual rice production per mu, combining one or two harvests a year, can reach at least 132,158,000 shi of grain in bumper years. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the Statistics Office of the provincial government, based on reports from 83 counties, totaled more than 119 million shi of early rice, middle rice, late rice, and glutinous rice. In addition to supplying the province's food and sales, an annual surplus of 2 million shi of rice can be left over, of which one-third of the surplus is produced in the warehouses of the Poyang Lake counties. According to the estimate of the Economic Commission of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the amount of rice released by the counties along the lake is 2,780,000 dan in Yugan, 982,800 dan in Wannian, 1,338,750 dan in Yujiang, 418,335 dan in Xingzi, 1,514,852 dan in Duchang, 647,516 dan in Hukou, 4,466,900 dan in Poyang, 1,656,608 dan in Fuliang, 1,946,580 dan in Leping, and 756,000 dan in Dexing. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the amount of rice produced in the Rao River area was 3,309,600 dan of early rice, 997,600 dan of middle rice, 1,912,200 dan of late rice, and 277,200 shi of glutinous rice, totaling 6,496,600 shi. With the ten counties along the lake accounting for one-eighth of the province's area, the rice production is so large, truly worthy of the name of granary.</p>
<p>This year, although the early, middle, and late rice in the counties along the lake once faced the risk of being flooded by white water in the summer, most of the basic dikes did not break. After a long period of sunny weather in the autumn, the paddy fields turned danger into safety, and the autumn harvest was generally abundant. The harvest of rice in Wannian is more than double that of a bumper year. It is estimated that the rice production in the counties along the lake is generally sufficient. The self-reliant farmers have spent their hard work and sweat in exchange for carts and granaries full of golden rice grains, so that the men, women, old and young who live and eat here can eat their fill and live a peaceful and prosperous life. In famine years, they can use the surplus to make up for the deficiency. The so-called "famine years do not hear of hungry cries." The winter plowing has stopped in a blink of an eye, which is their spare time to rest. Look at the farmhouses by the lake, three or four farmers gather on cold nights, blowing smoke and roasting fire, talking about farming, and starting their fireside chats.</p>
<p>Coloring the Sky Blue, Adding Beauty to Many Blue Gowns</p>
<p>Indigo was introduced to our country from India thousands of years ago and is the oldest colored plant among dyes. Leping, upstream of Poyang Lake, is adjacent to the lake, with a mild climate, deep soil, and non-wet clay, making it the most suitable area for planting indigo. Indigo is a kind of blue grass, divided into Artemisia indigo and Baphicacanthus cusia. Artemisia indigo turns into indigo for dyeing. At first glance, it is bright and shiny, but after a long time, it turns green and gradually loses its dyeing ability. Baphicacanthus cusia turns into indigo for dyeing. It looks dull and has the color of Annam. The indigo paste can maintain its color for several years without fading.</p>
<p>In the past, the annual output of Leping indigo was about 400,000 to 500,000 market shi, with Artemisia indigo accounting for one-third and Baphicacanthus cusia accounting for two-thirds. The area planted with indigo in the county is 300,000 to 400,000 mu, and there are about 200,000 indigo farmers. The indigo yield per mu is 1.5 to 2 market shi for Artemisia indigo and 2 to 3 market shi for Baphicacanthus cusia. Before the invasion of foreign indigo, the indigo cloth, moon blue, and blue cloth woven by hand in the mainland were all dyed with local indigo. At that time, there were more than 70 Leping indigo dyeing workshops, with large ones having more than 100 technicians. This was considered the golden age of the Leping indigo industry. Since the import and sale of foreign indigo, users have found it cheap and labor-saving, and the original local indigo market has become increasingly narrow. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, foreign indigo was cut off, and the demand for local indigo revived and gradually raised its head again. Last year, the market price at the place of origin rose sharply from 3,000 to 4,000 to 70,000 yuan per hundred catties, and indigo farmers and indigo merchants all made great profits.</p>
<p>This year, the harvest of indigo in Leping is expected to be better than in previous years. Although the price has fallen in the past month, it is still hovering between 50,000 and 60,000 yuan. There are still shipments to Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hangzhou, Xunyang, and other provinces. The indigo farmers, knowing that last year's income was abundant, only know to make the most of the land and then hope for extravagance. Every time the blue seedlings mature in late autumn, wooden buckets are lined up by the river, and the sound of churning indigo can be heard everywhere, without stopping for a moment. Their spirit of working hard and enjoying their work is expressed in the smiles and words of every indigo farmer. The simple and unadorned men and women in the inland rural areas wear naturally beautiful blue gowns, which are all exchanged for their strength and sweat.</p>
<p>Sweet as Honey, Symbolizing Cultural Progress</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province is an important sugar production area in our country, and the producing areas are almost all over the province, especially the old Ganzhou and Raozhou prefectures. Leping, Dexing, and other counties upstream of Poyang Lake have a wide planting of sugarcane. Sugarcane is the best raw material for sugar making. In the sugarcane-producing counties in the Rao River area along the lake, there are five counties: Poyang, Fuliang, Wannian, Leping, and Dexing. Among the above five counties, Leping has the richest sugarcane production. Leping sugarcane has long and sweet stalks. The sweet sugarcane produced in the Rao River area is mostly named Leping sugarcane.</p>
<p>The total planting area is 7,350 mu of sugarcane fields in Leping, 520 mu in Wannian, 1,000 mu in Poyang, 5,438 mu in Fuliang, and 4,200 mu in Dexing. The annual output of Leping is 553,000 dan, Wannian 43,000 dan, Fuliang 190,330 dan, Poyang 60,000 dan, Wannian 22,500 dan, and Zongxing 13,400 dan. In the 16th and 17th years of the Republic (1927 and 1928), there were more than 70 local sugar factories in Leping and Dexing. The value of sugar exported was no less than 800,000 yuan. Yujiang produced 90,000 dan of sugar annually, and Wannian 20,000 dan. Yugan produced 110,000 dan. The total value of exports was slightly higher than that of Leping. The sugar produced was all of the red sand and dry block types. Although foreign sugar was dumped in large quantities in the mainland, due to the different quality and taste of red and white, each had its own sales channels. In recent years during the Anti-Japanese War, the source of foreign sugar was cut off, and mainland users used sugarcane sugar instead. The sales volume increased year by year, and the price also rose accordingly. Ten years ago, the market price of sugarcane sugar was only 7 or 8 yuan to 15 or 16 yuan per dan, but last year it soared to 50,000 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>This year, farmers in the producing areas have benefited greatly from sugar, and they are all engaged in production on a large scale. Sugarcane harvesting began in the first ten days of last month, and it will be completed within this month. The output has increased compared to last year. Various sugar factories are preparing to set up cars for boiling, and the sugar households' existing goods have been reported to be scarce, and they are rushing to sell new sugar on the market. The current market price of old sugar is 90,000 yuan for Zhenjian, 85,000 yuan for red sand, 60,000 yuan for raw water red sand, and 30,000 yuan for leaking water. In the future, the market price may still increase.</p>
<p>In the most recent seven or eight years, the brisk production and sales of sugarcane sugar have been a great source of profit for sugarcane farmers. In addition to daily consumption as fruit, many foods in the sugar-producing areas are made with sugar, which seems to symbolize the leisurely and sweet life of the people in the sugar-producing areas, and is in line with the theory that civilization and things go hand in hand: "The more advanced a country is, the more sugar it consumes." In this way, it not only increases the wealth of the region, but also promotes the progress of local culture.</p>
<p>Fragrant Red Lotus Roots, Lotus Coins Are Everywhere in the Lake</p>
<p>Poyang has many plains and rich lakes and marshes. Farmers adapt to local conditions and plant lotus on a large scale, and the yield of lotus seeds is also the most abundant, which is the main sideline income of Poyang farmers for the year. Poyang lotus products are no less than those produced in Hunan. The seeds are large, powdery, and of excellent quality and taste. Lotus is divided into red and white, with red being more prevalent, but white being of better quality. The land in the lakes and marshes is all bone-free mud, which is wet, loose, and fertile, making it easy to plant lotus. Farmers plant at will and without much effort, allowing it to grow naturally. After the lotus matures and the seeds are harvested, the lotus roots are continuously dug up in winter when the lake water dries up, either as vegetables or made into lotus root powder, which are all called delicacies. Before the war, the market price of Poyang lotus was only 20 or 30 yuan per dan. In recent years, the price has gradually increased. Last year, the selling price at the place of origin was 90,000 to 110,000 yuan. This year, the new white lotus has risen to 180,000 yuan in the past month, and it is being shipped to Shanghai, Suzhou, Xunyang, and Wuhan.</p>
<p>What lake lotus is most afraid of is flooding with white water, which damages the lotus stems. If the stems are broken, the lotus pods cannot grow, and the seeds will wither. If there is no flood year, the production will be abundant, especially when the lotus stems are strong and the lotus leaves are dense, and the red and white buds bloom in the morning and evening, setting off a natural and colorful picture. If you have read the article "Ode to the Lotus," when you see the graceful lotus pods and fragrant lotus roots in the lake, and the fish playing in the lotus coins, you will naturally feel the same love as Zhou Zi!</p>
<p>Clothing and Covering the People, Keeping Out the Cold Is as Good as Silk</p>
<p>The counties in the Rao prefecture of northern Jiangxi are alluvial lands on the shores of Poyang Lake, making them the most suitable areas for cotton cultivation. The cotton planting area in the province is also the largest in Duchang, Poyang, Yugan, Wannian, Hukou, Leping, and Fuliang counties. The cotton seeds are mostly of the medium cotton type, with white seeds, black seeds, and smooth seeds. The best quality is Hukou white seed cotton, which is the best variety of cotton in the province, and also occupies a considerable position in the domestic medium cotton grades. The "Jiujiang Flower" mentioned in the Shanghai and Wuhan markets refers to this cotton. Its characteristics are strong development and rich production, with each mu of seed cotton harvesting priced at 110 to 200 catties. However, because the fibers are coarse and short, it cannot spin cotton yarn of more than 20 counts, and the other cotton, which is 1 to 8/5 inches long, can only spin cotton yarn of 8 to 16 counts, which is far behind the quality of improved American cotton varieties in other provinces.</p>
<p>In the past, the sales of cotton, such as Jiujiang and Hukou cotton, were mostly purchased by the Jiuxing Yarn Factory in Xunyang. The rest was mostly for self-use or for local hand-woven cloth. According to the statistics of the Jiujiang Customs, the number of Jiangxi cotton exports was the largest in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), with 70,809 dan, which was almost one in a hundred compared to the cotton exports of Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>This year, the cotton production in various counties is generally considered abundant. However, although the cotton field area has increased compared to before, the growth was not long due to excessive rainfall this summer. After autumn, the weather was severely dry, and the late development of cotton was slightly hindered. Compared with the first estimate, it is slightly inferior. With the increased planting of cotton fields everywhere, the average production should not be short. When the new cotton was launched this year, the market price of seed cotton for small flower vendors was 600 to 1,000 per catty. Converted to one dan of peeled cotton, the price was 245,000 yuan, which was ten times higher than last year. In the past month, due to the rising prices, the Hujiang flower market has opened at 170,000 to 190,000 yuan, and flower sales have become bleak. The cotton farmers are also holding back the harvested flowers and not selling them.</p>
<p>Their original purpose of planting cotton is first for self-use. If sales are brisk and prices rise, they will sell the surplus. If sales are sluggish and prices fall, they will store them all for use in quilts and cotton clothes at any time. Women who can spin will spin, and those who can weave will weave. Those who cannot spin or weave will exchange flowers for cloth, only seeking to keep out the cold and not admiring brocade clothes. No matter how the price of cloth rises in the market, they are simply not affected in the slightest. They have the style of Mahatma Gandhi, growing, spinning, weaving, and wearing their own clothes, which is a self-reliant doctrine that does not seek help from others. As for silk and wool fabrics, they are even further away from them and never have any connection with them in terms of clothing. "Warm cloth clothes, fragrant vegetable roots, and a long taste of production," this seems to be a portrayal of their real life.</p>
<p>A Puff of Smoke, Revealing a Different Kind of Fragrance</p>
<p>The tobacco-producing areas in Jiangxi Province include Nanxiong, Ruichang, Jinxian, Ruijin, Guangfeng, Duchang, and Poyang counties. The best quality tobacco is in Nanxiong and Ruijin. Poyang is second, and Duchang is second again. Poyang and Duchang have a wide area of tobacco planting, which is a major source of sideline income for rural areas. Before the war, the total value of Jiangxi tobacco exports was more than 3 million yuan annually. Farmers plant tobacco in varying amounts, mostly planted in the gaps in the plains. The planting procedure is as follows: in the third and fourth months of the lunar calendar, the small tobacco seeds are sown and planted. Bean cakes are used as fertilizer and mixed into the soil of the tobacco field. After cultivating once, an earthen ridge is built. After a certain period of time, the tobacco seedlings are transplanted onto the tobacco field. In the fifth and sixth months, the tobacco will grow, and it can be harvested after a short time. The harvesting process of tobacco leaves has two periods: "Fu leaves" and "Autumn leaves." Fu leaves have better quality and taste and are more expensive. The harvesting period is in the dog days of summer. Autumn leaves are harvested in autumn, and the quality is inferior and the price is lower.</p>
<p>Now that prices are rising, tobacco shreds sell for more than 100 yuan per ounce. Farmers have a deep affection for Biyan, which is a good companion that they cannot do without during their field work. In order to avoid the outflow of profits, tobacco farmers in the producing areas mostly use their own tobacco leaves to make their own tobacco shreds, self-planting, self-made, and self-smoking. Their tobacco pipes are all made of bamboo roots, with a tobacco pouch tied on top. They are usually inserted in the waist, and they cannot be without it at any time, whether they are idle or busy. When they occasionally hold it and offer it to guests for a taste, a puff of smoke especially reveals a different kind of fragrant aroma. The recreational function of this "love grass" is no less than "tea as wine when a guest comes on a cold night."</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Top Ten Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>— By Our Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Hualien Port, 11th Dispatch</p>
<p>Taiwan Province, taken over from the Japanese, experienced a few months of chaos this spring that are unbearable to recall. The confusion, congestion, and delays are still fresh in people's minds. However, that was only a temporary transitional phenomenon. In the past half-year, the urgent improvements and reorganization of transportation have shortened the distance between Keelung and Kaohsiung ports and the mainland. At the same time, the people of this province deeply feel that only by gratefully acknowledging the rapid restoration of transportation can Taiwan truly become a province of China in name and in fact.</p>
<p>The most significant achievement is that railway transport capacity has been restored to 100%. Previously, 60 trains were dispatched daily, but now that number has reached 120. On the highway front, main routes maintain one bus per day, with crucial routes having four buses a day, and the most important routes achieving a bus every five minutes, like the Taipei-Keelung line. Regarding the harbor cleanup, Keelung and Kaohsiung have already salvaged 50,000 tons of sunken ships, with nine of them already ashore. Keelung has two and Kaohsiung has three more still being salvaged. The wartime scenes of the harbors can no longer be found.</p>
<p>Your correspondent, while staying at a hotel in Hualien Port, had a half-hour interview with Director Ren Xianqun, who is in charge of the lifeline of Taiwan's new transportation. He told the reporter that from January to June of next year, eight domestic and international shipping routes will be established, and two more must be completed in the second half of the year, making a total of ten major shipping routes, including:</p>
<p>(1) Taiwan East Coast Route: From Keelung to Suao in the east, Hualien Port, Taitung, Green Island, Orchid Island, Kaohsiung, and Penghu, using 500-ton ships, starting in January.</p>
<p>(2) Taiwan, Xiamen, Fuzhou triangle route.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Line: This is a regular shipping route, and it has been decided that three ships will rotate, with one ship every ten days. One of the ships can arrive in 36 hours.</p>
<p>(4) Qingdao, Tianjin Line, twice a month in January.</p>
<p>(5) Shantou, Hong Kong Line, twice a month in January.</p>
<p>(6) Wenzhou Line.</p>
<p>(7) Yangtze River Line, direct to Hankou.</p>
<p>(8) Dalian Line, will be opened as soon as the situation stabilizes.</p>
<p>(9) Philippines Line.</p>
<p>(10) Singapore Line.</p>
<p>(9) and (10) are scheduled to begin in the second half of the year. In addition to these soon-to-be-realized sea routes, a provincial airline is also planned, and air transport in this province can be restored next year. All of these are being actively carried out under two policies. The main focus is on political significance and increasing provincial treasury revenue - encouraging travel to Taiwan. The second is the decision to make Keelung a purely trade port, with all foreign goods being transshipped from that port to various parts of South China. Kaohsiung Port in the south will become the focus of transportation to the mainland and various parts of Southeast Asia! Currently, the storage capacity of Keelung's warehouses has expanded from 20,000 tons to 80,000 tons, and it is expected to reach 200,000 tons by the end of next year. Kaohsiung Port aims to increase from 45,000 tons to 150,000 tons, and general travel facilities are also being designed.</p>
<p>In Taiwan Province, where manpower and resources are quite difficult, Director Ren fully understands the difficulties that must be encountered in order to complete these ten shipping routes on schedule. However, he said frankly and firmly that there is no other way but to overcome difficulties. He further pointed out that the favorable conditions for the shipping industry in the province are low prices, simplified procedures, and the "over-supply" that is exactly the opposite of the mainland.</p>
<p>Director Ren firmly believes that with his spirit and experience in reorganizing transportation in the past six months, maritime transportation next year will definitely not become a problem. Because this will not only prosper the province, but also strengthen the centripetal force of the isolated Taiwan Province towards the mainland, shortening the voyage between Taiwan and the mainland! Keelung and Kaohsiung will also regain their former glory in world trade and transportation!"</p>
<h3>Kowloon General Relief Administration Warehouse Fire</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Zi Jian</p>
<p>Kowloon, 18th Dispatch</p>
<p>The warehouse set up by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) on Chatham Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, opposite Hong Kong, suddenly caught fire at 10:30 p.m. on the 17th, burning for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Army and Navy were also dispatched to assist in fighting the fire, because in addition to the CNRRA warehouse, there was also a parking lot for the Hong Kong military authorities, with hundreds of military vehicles parked there. Fortunately, the fire did not spread, and some automobiles and important equipment (including a lathe worth HK$600,000) in the CNRRA warehouse were also unharmed. According to current information, the goods that have been lost include a large number of automobile tires, several hundred in number, some barrels of gasoline, and other items that are still under investigation.</p>
<p>The CNRRA warehouse is located at the intersection of Chatham Road and Gascoigne Road, occupying a large area and surrounded by barbed wire. The vehicles and related equipment transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) are stored here. At one end of the yard, there are two wooden houses used as offices, one for storing tires, canvas, etc. and the other for the power generation room, because the area is as dark as ink at night. In order to protect the stored goods and prevent them from being stolen by bandits, the authorities generate their own electricity to make the surroundings bright, making it easier for the guards to defend. Beside the generator room, there are four rooms where the watchmen and the generator driver live. It is said that after the power generation started last night, the driver went out. Unexpectedly, perhaps because the time was too long and the heat was too high, the wooden board on the side suddenly caught fire, causing the fire. The fire on the wooden board quickly spread to the sundries in the room and the wooden house storing tires and canvas, and the fire became even more intense. After receiving the report, three fire trucks rushed to the rescue, but it took half an hour for water to arrive, due to the water supply being cut off at night. Before the water arrived, the firefighters could only use fire extinguishers to put out the fire and demolish the road to prevent the fire from spreading to other places. By the time the hoses were opened, the two small wooden houses had been almost completely burned down, but because they were mostly tires, the fire was still very strong. Similar small explosions often occurred during the burning. After 11:40 p.m., the fire was completely under control and extinguished at around 12:00 a.m. At that time, the northwest wind was blowing, and it did not spread to most of the vehicles on its side. There were hundreds of unopened car boxes stacked three stories high, occupying an area of six to seven zhang. There were also twenty-four newly assembled cars on Gascoigne Road, and six or seven cars under the barbed wire. In addition, a lathe worth HK$600,000 for repair tools was unharmed. After the incident, UNRRA engineer Keaton immediately arrived at the scene to direct the employees to rescue, and the most valuable lathe was rescued at this time.</p>

<h3>Science and Culture: Chinese Delegation's Evening Party: The Musical Accomplishments of Two Young Ladies from Hubei and Guangdong Can Rival European and American Artists</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent in Paris Wang Ren</p>
<p>Dispatch from the 13th</p>
<p>From mid-November to mid-December 1946, the French called it Science and Culture Month, or "Mois de I'Unesco." The music of the piano and song, the joy of banquets, and the grand occasion were unprecedented, always giving people a sense of being overwhelmed. The most commendable was the evening party hosted by the Chinese Science and Culture Delegation at the Société de Chimie at 9:00 p.m. on December 9th. Attendees included Ambassador Qian Jiping (to Thailand), Mrs. Qian and Miss Qian, officials from the Paris embassy and consulates, representatives from various countries to the Science and Culture Congress, and important figures from friendly countries such as the United States, Britain, and France. Also present were Ms. Yang Lianxin, a female vocalist from the Royal Academy of Music in London; Ms. Rosemarie Anderson, a former student who flew to Paris to invite Ms. Yang to promote national glory in Norway; representatives from the Science and Culture industries: Dr. Zhao Yuanren, Dr. Li Shuhua, Dr. Cheng Tianfang, Dr. Zhu Kezhen, and Professor Chen Yuan; Xiao Zisheng (Yu), Chairman of the Sino-French Association and former Vice Minister of Agriculture and Mining; Chen Yuan's wife, Xiao Lingxiao; Ms. Zhuo, wife of the reclusive scholar; former Professor Pan Yuliang; Dr. Zhou Lin; Xie Shoukang, former Chinese ambassador to the Holy See and a scholar of the Belgian Royal Academy; Hu Tianshi, Director of the Swiss International Library; Guo Youshou, former Director of the Sichuan Education Department; Qian Cundian, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the UK; and delegation members Qu Junong, Liang Fangzhong, Ye Junjian, Kuang Zixiu, Wang Chengxu, and Qian Sanqiang, as well as hundreds of Chinese and foreign male and female guests.</p>
<p>The knowledge and skills of Chinese students studying in Europe in recent years have made significant progress compared to the end of the First Paris Peace Conference twenty years ago. The great Renaissance plan of the Science and Culture Bureau has provided an excellent opportunity for famous Chinese figures in the arts to show their talents on the international stage. For example, the two young ladies from Hubei and Guangdong who came to help this time have scientific accomplishments and artistic skills that rival European and American talents. This is only possible with a significant sacrifice of money and time over a decade or so. China's long-term war of resistance has just completed the efforts of these artists, which is enough to make compatriots at home and abroad optimistic about the future of China. The piano and song programs that enhanced the Science and Culture delegation's evening party should be divided into three parts, as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The first part: Ms. Zhou Xiaoyan, daughter of Shanghai banker Zhou Cangbai, a singer, sang Chinese songs with piano accompaniment (Piano): (1) Song of the Lotus Time. (2) Petite Pois Rouges (Red Bean Song). The above two songs were arranged by Chinese young composer Liu Xue'an. (3) Love Call, the music score was arranged by Jiang Wenye. (4) How Can I Help Thinking of You. Composed by Zhao Yuanren, who is now a professor of Chinese Studies at Harvard University in the United States. (5) A Yunnan folk song with a slightly rustic flavor, this song was composed by A. Tcherepnine, a famous Russian musician who once traveled in China, merging Eastern and Western sentiments into one. The singer was familiar and skillful, and the sound was round and jade-like, which was most welcomed by the Western guests present.</p>
<p>(B) The middle section: Ms. Li Xianmin from Lingnan, who graduated from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music with first place and studied abroad with famous teachers for many years, played the piano with outstanding talent. (1) Opera Prelude, composed by Liu Xue'an. (2) La Fluteu Berger (The Shepherd's Flute), composed by He Luting. (3) Shepherd's Music, composed by Lao Jingcheng. (4) Sketch, composed by Jiang Wenye. (5) Buckling Qin. (6) Yi Bi Zhonghua (Give it to China), the music scores of the above rain songs were all made by the Russian musician Tchaikovsky. Qi visited China in the past, felt something after listening to the pipa, and shaped its sound into music. Ms. Li sat sideways by the piano, her eyes were agile and her hands were quick, slowly twisting and lightly plucking, moving rhythmically, fiercely strumming and quickly striking, the beauty lies in being versatile. "Yi Bi Zhonghua" combines the best of both worlds. In my life, I have experienced European and American music performances, but I have never seen this style with this impression. (C) The last segment was the most exciting performance. The wonder lies in Ms. Zhou's mastery of several languages such as English, Italian, French, and German, which she performed in turn, as if she had the skill of incarnation. On the spot, she composed a seven-character quatrain about Ms. Zhou Xiaoyan broadcasting a clear voice:</p>
<p>"The golden age is full of vigor, singing the red beans with a smile. Her pearly throat sings busily like a swallow, and her voice education is widely publicized because of her talent." I also received a recent photo from Ms. Li Xianmin, which I will repay with a poem:</p>
<p>"The fragrance of clothes moves slightly in the bright night, lightly plucking and playing with a hundred charms. The ancient immortals of lyrics are all surnamed Li, not only the magical hands are different from Xia Qing, (inviting female aviators from North and South America, with the same surname as you)."</p>

<h3>A Call for Theater Movement</h3>
<p>Some comrades engaged in theater work recently had a symposium at the Central Cultural Movement Committee. They expressed many opinions on the Chinese theater movement. Mr. Yu Shangyuan was appointed to organize the meeting and the following article is a record of the organization. It is hoped that people in the community who care about the theater movement will provide more assistance so that the Chinese theater movement can develop normally.</p>
<p>With the victorious end of the eight-year War of Resistance, we should build a new China of national independence, democratic freedom, and people's happiness with more abundant passion and more active efforts. This is the responsibility of every Chinese people, and it is also the responsibility of every theater worker. Unfortunately, after returning to the capital and restoring order, and in preparation for starting work, like other cultural undertakings, the theater movement faced even more difficulties. The experience of the past year tells us that if we do not quickly save the current crisis, the future of the theater movement is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>The environment during the eight years of the War of Resistance was extremely difficult, but thanks to the sincere unity of theater workers across the country, under the leadership of the China National Theater Association Against Aggression, everyone did their best and went all out, laying a fairly solid foundation. Whether in the rear, the front line, behind enemy lines, or in the isolated island of Shanghai, whether in cities or villages, visible achievements were made, directly or indirectly helping the War of Resistance. We do not want to hide our own shortcomings and certain weaknesses during this stage, nor do we want to ignore the various difficulties imposed on the theater movement by objective circumstances. Because the problems have not been resolved immediately and reasonably, we are still troubled today, and with the evolution of the objective situation, new problems are also emerging. We theater workers know that it is our responsibility to overcome all difficulties to promote the theater movement, but the theater movement is not an isolated thing that is isolated from the vast society. We cannot but ask the community and the government authorities to have a further understanding, sympathy and assistance for the current situation of the theater movement, so that it can smoothly overcome the current crisis.</p>
<p>In Nanjing (Shanghai, Hankou, and other recovered cities), theater groups - including state-run, private, professional, and amateur - cannot perform plays or spend all their efforts to perform plays with little praise and even lose money. This is a common phenomenon. Tracing the reasons, the first is the entertainment tax issue.</p>
<p>We do not think that the entertainment tax issue only has economic significance. Through the "40%" tax rate, it clearly treats drama and other entertainment as equal. We do not deny the entertainment value of drama, but the difference is that it has a greater educational effect - a broad education, that is, to improve the cultural level of the audience (people), and to get upward inspiration and encouragement from it. At the same time, drama is precisely the concrete manifestation of the culture of the country and the nation. This is the reason why the British would rather give up India than give up Shakespeare, and it is also the reason why we established the National Academy of Dramatic Arts and never thought of running a school to train entertainment talents; it is also the reason why the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department set up theater awards during the War of Resistance. Although the 40% entertainment tax is levied on the audience with the ticket, the theater group is actually the one who suffers the loss. If the tax is exempted or reduced to 5% or 10%, the audience will pay the same ticket price, but the theater group will increase its income, and can therefore reduce ticket prices and attract more audiences.</p>
<p>The general increase in prices has obviously greatly increased the cost of performances. The total expenditure of one performance is now very common at three to four hundred thousand yuan. Among them, the item that can be absolutely saved is the theater rent. When the China ×× Theater Troupe came to Beijing to perform, the rent for the National Grand Theater was 500,000 yuan per performance (per night), and then it rose to 1.8 million yuan per performance. Even if it can be reduced, it must be no less than 1 million yuan per performance. The Guangming Grand Theater, which can only accommodate 700 people, such as the one rented by the Great Wall Theater Company, costs 600,000 yuan per performance. Because the theater group does not have its own theater, it not only has to bear the above-mentioned huge rent, but also has intangible losses, such as the distance and length of the performance period cannot be free, which not only affects the economy, but also affects the art - the contract is not signed, and dare not start work. Once the contract is signed, it must be staged on schedule without allowing consideration of whether the play is practiced skillfully or not. This gives us the greatest pain.</p>
<p>Drama cannot be separated from the audience. The Nanjing theater movement, which has only just begun, is also affected by the audience. We are not criticizing the audience, but this is a fact. Due to high prices and difficult living conditions, the purchasing power of the general audience has been greatly reduced. Even if they like drama very much, they are often limited by their economic ability and cannot move forward. This is one. In addition to a group of people who returned from Chongqing, most of the people who struggled under the rule of the enemy and puppets, even if they have not completely fallen into low-level entertainment, are still relatively unfamiliar with drama, and are not used to finding what they need from the drama stage, and it is difficult to be enthusiastic. This is two. If the audience asks to find what they need from the drama stage, what can we give them? Reflecting reality is a characteristic of drama. When they feel that the stage at this time and place is distant from life at this time and place. One disappointment, one time you have to wait and see. This is three. To make the audience understand drama and love drama, there must be regular performances and excellent performances, and this is a difficult thing.</p>
<p>If we have unintentionally disappointed the audience, it is our own fault. We admit that there have been few new scripts this year, and even fewer scripts that meet the needs of this time and place. Before we ask playwrights to write more, we should understand the situation of playwrights. The fact is that, on the one hand, the objective environment up to now cannot be understood at a glance. It is a creative detour to praise or expose only the superficial phenomenon. This takes time. On the one hand, when performances (as well as publication and publication) are so difficult, there is no way to urge playwrights to constantly provide new works. Some people are preparing, some people are writing, and some people have written but are slow to come out. This requires a stable environment. Similarly, without time and a stable environment, not only playwrights, but also directors, actors and stage workers are equally difficult to have new creations, which forms stagnation and even regression.</p>
<p>The stagnation and even regression of theater workers is the stagnation and regression of the theater movement. Looking back on ourselves, we should blame ourselves for insufficient understanding, insufficient effort, and insufficient unity. However, in any case, the improvement of the objective environment is a more important prerequisite. We firmly believe that people in the community and government authorities love the theater movement. Therefore, at this time and place, we have described the current situation, and we hope:</p>
<p>(1) Confirm the status of drama in culture and education, and give active, strong, and planned support, so that drama can become the healthy spiritual food of the people across the country and an important pillar of the construction of the country.</p>
<p>(2) Exempt or reduce entertainment tax. Performances by state-run theater groups and private theater groups that have been approved by the competent authority shall be exempt from entertainment tax to reduce the burden on the theater group and popularize the audience.</p>
<p>(3) Establish state-run theaters, provide them to theater groups completely free of charge or at a very low rent. At the beginning, the property of the enemy and puppets can be requisitioned instead of construction.</p>
<p>(4) Protect the lives of theater practitioners, so that theater workers can work creatively and research with peace of mind and focus.</p>
<p>(5) Encourage script creation and performance.</p>
<p>This is the urgent task to save the crisis, and this is our call. We theater workers should unite as sincerely as during the War of Resistance, do our best, go all out, overcome difficulties together, overcome the crisis, and participate in the great cause of building a new China of national independence, democratic freedom, and people's happiness!</p>

<p>Publishing Industry Published every Thursday</p>
<h3>Publishing and Taxes</h3>
<p>— By Fu Tongxian</p>
<p>Recently, two major events have occurred in the Chinese publishing industry, both of which will have a major impact on the publishing industry. One is about the business tax of the book industry, and the other is about the increase in newspaper postage and telecommunications prices. The book industry and the press are asking the government to reconsider and save China's declining cultural industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the business tax of the book industry, we know that after the Shanghai Municipal Council resolved to exempt it, 286 bookstores in Shanghai elected 17 representatives to go to Beijing to petition, requesting the Ministry of Finance to exempt it. However, recently, the Book Industry Association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance through the Ministry of Education, which only allowed nationally designated and approved textbooks to be exempt from business tax, and the rest still had to be taxed. Now the book industry is sending representatives to Beijing again to petition. We hope that the government will especially cherish the cultural publishing industry and allow all of them to be exempted. At the same time, we also hope that the municipal authorities of this city will accept the resolution of the Municipal Council to increase construction damages on the one hand, and adopt the resolution to exempt the book industry from business tax on the other hand.</p>
<p>Regarding the increase in newspaper postage and telecommunications prices, the News Daily had a dramatic record on the 17th, which said: "Today, more than 150 reporters from all over the country went to Minister Yu to petition for the tenfold increase in postage and telecommunications prices in the Ministry of Transportation Building, which cost nearly 10 billion yuan to repair, and is unparalleled and exquisite, to maintain the original price and continue the cultural industry. Because under this high postage and telecommunications fee, the national press will suffer huge losses. During the two-hour appeal, Minister Yu said that he had no interest in making things difficult for the press." We know that the government has lost a lot in terms of postage and telecommunications and must find a way to make up for it. Reasonable price increases and the collection of business taxes are the country's financial resources, and we originally seemed to have nothing to criticize, but the government should not treat publishing and cultural undertakings the same as other businesses that aim to make profits, and should give them special consideration.</p>
<p>However, under the circumstances that the government is particularly focused on increasing revenue, we feel that the government should rectify tax collection, eliminate corruption, and the most important thing seems to be to make more efforts in reducing expenditure, so as not to over-plan on cultural undertakings.</p>
<h3>On the Path of Chinese Education Reform</h3>
<p>— Chen Kemei</p>
<p>Written by Chen Guofu, published by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>All those with foresight regarding Chinese education feel that Chinese education needs a philosophy to integrate its implementation under one or several principles. It can no longer be as in the past, copying and imitating from the West, resulting in little effect after fifty years of education. Although everyone feels this way, few have come forward to provide this need. Mr. Wu Junsheng once suggested that scholars from all aspects of the country first conduct a comprehensive investigation of China's past culture and modern needs to determine a common philosophy. Then, based on this philosophy, deduce several guiding principles as the theoretical and practical foundation to form an educational philosophy. This is one method. Of course, scholars from all aspects can also freely publish their research first, and then these studies can be synthesized or selected to determine the principles of educational theory and practice as an educational philosophy. Perhaps neither of these methods is applicable, and only the free development of various ideas and the natural formation of educational philosophy will suffice.</p>
<p>In 1933, Mr. Jiang Qi published a book called *Educational Philosophy* (also named *Three Principles of the People Education*), hoping it would become a Chinese educational philosophy; its impact is unknown. Now I have also read Mr. Chen Guofu's *On the Path of Chinese Education Reform*, which also proposes educational reform based on the Three Principles of the People. However, this book is different from the previous one. The former leans towards the purely theoretical aspect, while this book focuses on the application aspect, with a complete educational plan.</p>
<p>The content of this book, simply put, includes two parts. The first part discusses general principles and education at all levels; the second part discusses various educational issues and methods related to implementing reforms. Regarding principles, it is "entirely based on our country's inherent ethical philosophy, starting with filial piety and brotherly love, gradually expanding to realize the ideal of the world being for all and universal harmony." ... "Even the entire educational program or system in the book is based on our country's philosophy of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world peace as the basis for dividing the program, so that each stage of education in the future has a clear central goal." (From Wang's preface) And these two parts emphasize principles, as the author said, "I believe that in improving education, principles are important, and methods are secondary." (Page 1) Therefore, the nature of this book has the flavor of educational philosophy and the possibility of forming an educational philosophy.</p>
<p>Today's Need for Educational Philosophy</p>
<p>The author completed this book based on his decades of observation and experience. It does indeed have unique insights and complete proposals. For example, he said that the "main reason for the failure" of past education "lies in the fact that our education has lost its spirit of self-confidence and initiative. We only see others and forget ourselves; therefore, we only know how to copy and cannot digest, let alone..." He also said that the reason for the failure of Chinese education... [unclear text] ... found the origin of education... [unclear text] ... over the past few decades... [unclear text] ... "It is the ethical view of maintaining the mountain..." [unclear text] ...? That is... [unclear text] ... is the author... [unclear text] ... is the author... that he... that the view itself is... but that China's future education should still maintain filial piety as its starting point and give full play to its effectiveness" is unique. Based on this starting point of education, the author especially values family education, "Therefore, family education is the fundamental question of all problems in the human world," to "lay a foundation for being a person" for life. Starting from this foundation, "national education," "life education," "special education," "normal education," "university education," and "Tai Xue education" are all based on the philosophy of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world peace: these are the author's complete proposals. Therefore, this book is also a most stimulating work. It can stimulate the creation of Chinese educational philosophy and also stimulate the opening up of new Chinese education.</p>
<p>As for whether China's educational philosophy should be formed in this way? Should China's new education be handled this way? In my humble opinion, I will briefly state a few points as a modest contribution.</p>
<p>The Starting Point of Education</p>
<p>I have stated before that Chinese culture has two characteristics: one is the characteristic of ethics, and the other is the characteristic of conservatism. I have also criticized that this kind of ethical culture pays too much attention to family relations in human relations and ignores larger social relations. Therefore, Chinese people have too deep a family concept, resulting in a too weak national concept or social concept, and cannot produce a strong and unified national group to resist the various invasions of the great powers (Education and Culture, Educational Communication, Volume 3, Issue 41). Although it is said very well in theory that taking filial piety and brotherly love as the starting point can "establish normal rules for ethical relations with parents and brothers, and from this extend outwards, so that social order and national peace can be maintained as a result"; but in fact, most Chinese people (especially the most highly educated people who received the old education) only know about their family and do not know about the country, let alone the world, and the so-called "the world being for all" or "universal harmony" is even more out of the question. Why hasn't thousands of years of education on ethics taught people to extend filial piety and brotherly love to society? There are two reasons for this: one is that the ideal is too high and not easy to implement; the other is that the circle is too large and cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Therefore, thousands of years of education on ethics have only taught people to live a family life and maintain a patriarchal society; but now that survival competition is so fierce and national struggles are so fierce, it will soon transform China's family life and patriarchal society.</p>
<p>The Goal of Education</p>
<p>Therefore, what we need to teach people now is how to seek the survival of the nation, to enable the entire people to engage in production and construction in peacetime and resist and defend themselves in wartime, and to enable everyone to have the intelligence for production and self-defense and the spirit of unity and sacrifice. Even "the world being for all" and "universal harmony" may as well be taught one step later. When it comes to the intelligence for production and self-defense, it is naturally based on science; when it comes to the spirit of unity and sacrifice, it is also naturally based on democracy: only science and democracy can enable the Chinese nation to catch up head-on; and only science and democracy can achieve the world being for all and universal harmony. Therefore, China's new education should take the Three Principles of the People as its ideal, national rejuvenation as its goal, and nationalization, democratization, scientification, and technologization as its objectives. Or, to put it more concretely, China's new education should cultivate healthy citizens who can build and defend themselves. The focus of this new education is to promote a new national spirit - a spirit that integrates the individual with the nation, a spirit of dedicating oneself to the nation. Only with this spirit can the Chinese nation stand firm; only if the nation stands firm first can it seek the transformation of the world, from family to nation, from nation to world, which is the process of human social evolution and the stage that every country must go through. The starting point of this new education is individuality. Based on the individuality of each child, develop his or her body and mind so that he or she can share in the work of national rejuvenation; be sure to coordinate the development of individuality and the rejuvenation of the nation to adapt to this unprecedented era.</p>
<p>As for the methods of developing children's bodies and minds and promoting the national spirit, there is no need to go around in a big circle. Just use the common nature and special individuality of children to cultivate their national emotions and national consciousness. For example, children have a common curiosity, which can be used to visit China's historical sites and scenic spots to arouse their emotions of loving China and their awareness of recognizing China; to make them feel and know that China is a civilized nation with a long history, and to make them feel and know that China has a vast territory and abundant resources: in this way, children's spirit of willingness to sacrifice for their country and nation can arise spontaneously.</p>
<p>In short, the ideals of new national education should be in line with the needs of the times. What does the current era need? It is national struggle and national survival, that is, to cultivate healthy citizens who have a national spirit, and to seek national survival from the national struggle. Of course, we are by no means saying that we do not want people to be filial and fraternal, but we believe that people who are filial and fraternal do not necessarily love the country and the nation, while people who love the country and the nation must also be able to practice filial piety and brotherly love.</p>
<p>The Program of Education</p>
<p>The author said, "The stage of elementary school education is an education of self-cultivation, to teach the basis of how to be a person and to cultivate the concept of loving the country and the nation. The stage of junior high school education is to cultivate the skills and knowledge for individuals to make a living independently. The stage of senior high school education is not only to educate him to be able to make a living for himself, but also to be able to help others make a living. Therefore, the stage of middle school can be said to be the education of 'regulating the family.' But the 'family' mentioned here should be extended to be interpreted as society. When it comes to the stage of university, it teaches the education of 'governing the country,' cultivating his specialized skills to seek the welfare of the country and the nation. Further up is Tai Xue, which teaches the education of 'pacifying the world.' In this way, from self-cultivation, regulating the family, governing the country to pacifying the world, the front and back are connected and each becomes a stage, which is really a very good educational program." (Page 12) Dividing the current educational programs at all levels according to the program of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world peace in the *Great Learning* is, in our view, fundamentally different in nature. The educational program in the *Great Learning* is an educational program for cultivating a small number of scholar-officials, while the current educational program at all levels is an educational program for cultivating talents at all levels, and it is fundamentally difficult to coordinate the two. The difference between the educational program in the *Great Learning* and the current educational program is very obvious. Because the self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world peace in the *Great Learning* are the entire program for cultivating one kind of talent and cannot be separated. From self-cultivation to regulating the family, from regulating the family to governing the country, from governing the country to pacifying the world, it is a continuous process and cannot be divided into stages. As for the current education at all levels, it is to cultivate talents at all levels, and each can become a stage. As the author said, "Each stage has the effect of one stage; each step of teaching has the use of one step": whether it has been achieved in fact (the big problem with Chinese education is that it has not achieved this), it should be so in principle. Therefore, China's new education must not divide the educational program for cultivating multiple types of talents according to the educational program for cultivating one type of talent.</p>
<p>The above two points are only discussed in terms of the largest ones; other aspects such as the reflective teaching method, the combination of the Three Principles of the People and education at each stage, and life education have not been discussed in detail. As for emphasizing mother education and paying attention to the continuity and independence of education at all levels, there are all insightful views, which have not been elaborated on. In China, it is really commendable that Mr. Chen has found a direction for Chinese education from a consistent standpoint, although our opinions are not completely the same. In short, this is a very stimulating work and a good reference for those who are interested in reforming Chinese education. It is worth everyone's chewing over and reviewing.</p>

<h3>The Best-Selling Books in the United States in 1946</h3>
<p>— Lan Ning</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, *Time* magazine in the United States has conducted a review of the books published in the United States this year. In 1946, a total of 7,500 new books were published, of which 1,500 were novels, 300 were history books, and 400 were biographies. The quality of these books, generally speaking, is not very high.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, book critics have not published excessive praise. In the *New York Times Book Review*'s "Best Books of the Year" poll, no book has received unanimous endorsement from all book critics. Choosing the best among the short. In terms of the widest sales and the most money earned, it should be Ms. Betty MacDonald's *The Egg and I* - an epic about incubation (or an autobiography of married life) that sold 1.2 million copies. The remaining nine books on the best-selling list are as follows:</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<p>Author</p>
<p>This Side of Innocence Caldwell</p>
<p>The King's General Du Maurier</p>
<p>The Foxes of Harrow Frank Yerby</p>
<p>Arch of Triumph Maria Remarque</p>
<p>Brideshead Revisited Evelyn Waugh</p>
<p>David the King Geadys Schmitt</p>
<p>The Hucksters Frederic Wakeman</p>
<p>Non-Fiction Author</p>
<p>The Egg and I Betty MacDonald</p>
<p>Peace of Mind L. Liebman</p>
<p>I Chose Freedom Victor Kravchenko</p>
<p>Among the seven fiction books, most of the sales have exceeded one million. Among them, Remarque's *Arch of Triumph*, which was serialized in the *Saturday Evening Post*, has been translated into Chinese by Zhu Wen.</p>
<p>No one knows whether the reason why these books have such wide sales should be attributed to writing, advertising, or the promotion of American book clubs.</p>
<p>According to *Time* magazine, new literary geniuses have not yet appeared after the war. People in the American publishing industry often jokingly explain it this way: it hasn't been long since the war, so masterpieces haven't been completed yet. But is this true? Let's take a look at the book list after 1919 (World War I): Babbitt's *Rousseau and Romanticism*, Conrad's *The Arrow of Gold*, Keynes' *The Economic Consequences of the Peace*, Masefield's *Reynard the Fox*, O'Neill's *The Moon of the Caribbees*, and Maugham's *The Moon and Sixpence* were all immortal works of that year. The Second World War may have given people too much stimulation, and geniuses cannot temporarily answer those complex questions through art.</p>
<h3>"Son of the Regiment"</h3>
<p>— Li Jinxiang</p>
<p>Written by Kataev, translated by Mao Dun, first published in early October 1946</p>
<p>Soviet writer Kataev, his name may not be unfamiliar to readers in the mountain country. Seven or eight years ago, two of his works, *Time, Forward!* and *I Am the Son of the Working People*, had Chinese translations.</p>
<p>*Son of the Regiment* is a novel with a large number of readers in the Soviet Union. It won the Stalin Literature Award in 1945. In that year, there were a total of four literary awards in the novel category. *Son of the Regiment* won the second prize in the novel category. The first prizes were *Young Guards* and *Lavoi*, and the other novel that won the second prize was *One Green Earth*.</p>
<p>The whole book takes the Soviet-German War as its theme, and the story develops in a plain atmosphere from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the book, Vanya, is a lonely Russian child. The brutal ambitious man destroyed his beautiful home, killed his parents, and made him wander outside all year round. Fortunately, he met the motherland's scouts, who rescued him and brought him to his regiment headquarters.</p>
<p>Moreover, the scouts soon discovered the child's genius, intelligence, courage, and attractiveness. He was born a scout. But when the order from his superiors came down, underage children were not allowed to stay on the front line. He immediately sent someone to send him back to the rear.</p>
<p>Orders cannot overcome people's will. Vanya resolutely opposed being sent back, and after it failed, he escaped from the sender's oversight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he met Captain Yelagiyev, the superior who ordered him to be sent back (Vanya did not know who he was at the time). The captain, like other scouts, had a good impression of him because of his intelligence and attractiveness. Without any doubt, he took the child back to the army.</p>
<p>Vanya's wish was fulfilled, and he is now a scout. When he went out for reconnaissance for the first time, he was unfortunately discovered by enemy soldiers and captured. He did not escape and return to the team until the enemy soldiers retreated.</p>
<p>The captain's experience was the same as Vanya's. His young wife, elderly mother, and boy who was not yet seven years old were all killed by the German vultures. All that remained were a series of anger and tragic memories. Therefore, he had a feeling of sympathy and closeness to Vanya, and soon adopted Vanya as his godson and transferred him to the artillery team as a reserve soldier to avoid danger (scouts are very dangerous).</p>
<p>War is cruel and inhuman. The artillery fire that reaches the sky and the exchange of blood and flesh. A tense and fierce tank battle came on the Soviet-German border. Captain Yelagiyev died for the country in this battle. A small note was found in his pocket. He asked his superiors to take care of his volume and train him to be a good soldier.</p>
<p>Vanya was soon sent to the military academy, starting a new page in his life history.</p>
<p>The story ends like this. The author portrays the personality of each person clearly, making people feel that the characters in the book are lifelike. This is the most successful point of the book.</p>
<p>*Son of the Regiment* is a retranslation based on the English translation. There are slight differences between the English translation and the Russian text. The Russian text has a total of 28 chapters, while the English text only has 25 chapters. The English translator deleted some of the less important ones, so the chapter divisions are also somewhat different. The Chinese translation is the same as the English translation, but there are slight differences with the Russian text. This is also what readers should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Reading "Sex Psychology"</h3>
<p>— Meng Kun</p>
<p>Original work by Havelock Ellis</p>
<p>Translated and annotated by Pan Guangdan, published by the Commercial Press</p>
<p>As the author Zhi Ruo often mentions in this book, modern humans claim to be sufficiently civilized, but how ignorant and clueless they still are regarding matters of sex. This kind of error, deeply rooted and cultivated, can be said to reflect that the society we live in is not yet enlightened. The author's criticisms of Europeans and Americans half a century ago are still very relevant to the present situation in our country.</p>
<p>Westerners' taboo of discussing sex issues is constrained by religious tradition, while China has its own deformed moral concepts. Although the essence is different, the result is the same. From primitive people to the present era, the mysterious veil given to "sex" has never been lifted. However, if it could be regarded as an empty theory, it wouldn't matter if it were banished from the realm of thought, but it has a realistic and close relationship with every individual and cannot be abandoned!</p>
<p>Therefore, although it is not yet possible to openly discuss it on the surface of society, more people have already paid attention to it before considering it a matter that should be discussed. It is just that many sex books, taking advantage of the psychological fragility and curiosity of young people, have long been circulating semi-openly in the market and from hand to hand among young people. Because the compilers of these books lack seriousness, the content is often biased or even deliberately distorted. Not only do they fail to introduce readers to the necessary common sense, but they also unscientifically lead to various adverse consequences, becoming counter-educational.</p>
<p>Sacred Question</p>
<p>"Sex" is a sacred question and a responsibility that social educators should bear. Sex education is an urgent matter of utmost importance to the nation, whether in terms of spiritual life or communal life. Europeans and Americans only began to pay attention to this issue in the early 20th century. Besides the successive publication of many research books based on various unique perspectives and methods, regular periodicals also frequently discussed it, but the content tended to lean towards medicine or physiology. Later, after being applied as an outline for criminology, it gradually formed a unit of academic discipline with cultural significance.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Havelock Ellis, was a master who came after Sigmund Freud. He devoted almost his entire life to exploring this issue. With his talent for literary expression, the results of his research were printed and disseminated to various countries and societies time and time again. Although his point of view is also psychological, it differs from Freud's reliance on pure "psychoanalysis," and is therefore more scientific and progressive. Before the publication of this book, Ellis was already famous for his *Studies in the Psychology of Sex*. Although rich in content, it was not universal enough to serve as a handbook for imparting common knowledge. It was not until the writing of this book that this long-awaited deficiency was remedied.</p>
<p>Scientific Method</p>
<p>This book, which is less than 300,000 words, discusses every noteworthy "sex" issue in a simple but comprehensive way. The method is scientific, and even sociological and anthropological, analyzing and instructing from both horizontal and vertical perspectives, while also being educational. The author not only objectively exposes the existence of a fact, but also subjectively adds many opinions. These many opinions are what young people should encounter in the course of their lives and can often determine their happiness or misfortune.</p>
<p>In terms of content, in addition to the issues relating to sex psychology, as the title indicates, it also touches on various aspects of other sex issues. There are indeed clear boundaries that can be distinguished from sex physiology and sex hygiene. However, they are still interconnected and can be mutually enlightening and revealing.</p>
<p>Outline of the Book</p>
<p>The structure of the book is listed into eight chapters and forty-three sections, with a preface, a translator's preface, and two appendices (including an unpublished biographical sketch of Ellis). The form and context are clear. The first chapter, "General Considerations," discusses the author's overall views on the issue of "sex" and the motivation for research. The second chapter, "The Biology of Sex," starts from the physiological entity to explain the process of its transfer to the spirit, and discusses in more detail the "sexual selection" and the various factors of "sexual selection." The following chapter, "Sexual Impulses in Youth," talks about the way to deal with the initial presentation of love, and after stating the need for changes to the various detours, the author puts forward the request to give "sex education" to young people. The above three chapters have almost finished describing the normal psychology of sex. The next two chapters are a study of sexual perversion. The symbols of love, sexual deviations, and all kinds of abnormal sexual behaviors from childhood to old age are further examined from the critical attitudes given by society. This is the content of the fourth chapter. Extending from this similarity is the reversal of sex, which is the problem of "homosexuality." The author answers it in detail in the fifth chapter and concludes with the treatment of this abnormal phenomenon. The sixth chapter, "Marriage," explains this phenomenon from a psychological and social perspective, and has much to offer to supplement traditional opinions. "The Art of Love" in the seventh chapter speaks of its relationship from the perspective of sex, considering it one of the means of enjoying life. The final "Conclusion" separately discusses the "dynamics" and "sublimation" of sexual impulses, and the great accumulation of human culture cannot escape this primal force, which has always been considered obscene.</p>
<p>Achievements of the Translator</p>
<p>Even more praiseworthy is the translator, Mr. Pan Guangdan, who is an authoritative sociologist of the eugenics and physiology school in our country. His efforts in translating this book have epoch-making value and significance. The beauty of the translation is not only impeccable, but its fluency and seamlessness are truly admirable. In addition, there are nearly 100,000 words of annotations and an appendix on homosexuality separated from the annotations, which draw examples from ancient Chinese literature to give a new scientific evaluation, so that countless doubts in old literature have new basis. It is also considered another original way for Chinese scholars to study sex psychology.</p>
<p>Ellis's original work was considered a banned book in foreign countries twenty years ago. Fortunately, there are currently no enthusiasts in China coming out to "defend the Tao" and denounce it as indecent. Although similar books have been translated or written before, they have not been widely circulated. Another translation of this book was done by Tian Fengmingzhang, titled "Sex Psychology," and has been published six times. But in comparison, besides the shortcomings in annotations and writing style, Feng's work also has too many deletions regarding theoretical aspects. It is mentioned here in passing, but the contributions of the two introducers to our society are worthy of praise.</p>
<p>As for the only shortcoming of this book, it may be said that the author cannot completely shake off his moralistic flavor. This old man often advocates his moderate moral views throughout the book. However, even so, even though there are many other points that we cannot agree with, it is still not enough to diminish the value of this book. Even if it does not become a textbook model, its circulation among young people and the formation of new trends of thought spread by its wide circulation, and its contribution to the spiritual viewpoint of society, are still limitless.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Huihui</h3>
<p>— Shi Mo</p>
<p>In May of the thirty-third year [of the Republic, 1944], when the enemy attacked Changsha, Deng hastily took one of his female classmates back to the countryside, because the family of this female classmate had already lost their home before Changsha fell. Deng's family called her "Miss Yang." But Deng called his female classmate "Huihui." Huihui was quite beautiful, looking about nineteen years old, but Deng said she was only eighteen. Two soft, long braids hung down her shoulders, and a pair of large, dark eyes looked at people without any shyness. On the first day of her arrival, Deng's whole family was amazed. On the second day, the neighbors of Deng's family, discovering that such a young woman had arrived, were also amazed. By the third or fourth day, the nearby towns were all amazed.</p>
<p>People exchanged the same opinions after seeing her, saying, "How did this Miss Yang come to Deng's house? This is a time of war and chaos, a time of war and chaos, young people... but," saying this, everyone could not help but say at the same time, "Miss Yang is very beautiful, very pretty."</p>
<p>Deng's father, regarding Huihui's arrival, seeing that Deng took care of everything personally and was very attentive, also shook his head and said, "In this day and age, what love is there to be in love with?"</p>
<p>But soon, the enemy crossed Changsha and attacked Hengyang. This countryside was only a hundred *li* away from Changsha and immediately became restless. People were busy with their own escape and rarely talked about Huihui. Deng's family also gradually became familiar with Huihui, as if she were not there, or as if she were one of the family. When holding family meetings to discuss escaping, Huihui also sat beside Deng at the table.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, Deng's family moved entirely to a mountain valley fifteen *li* away from this town. From the second morning, Deng's family began to move.</p>
<p>At this time, Huihui suddenly became lively. She helped move this and that, lift this and that, and worked with Deng's mother, sister-in-law, and younger sister. When they felt they needed to ask Deng or a male worker to come, Huihui immediately did it and did it quickly and properly. In this way, Deng's mother felt very happy. A girl likes to do a boy's job, which is very suitable for "escaping."</p>
<p>After moving to the mountain valley, many families had moved in around Deng's house. Deng's family lived in two small thatched huts belonging to a tenant farmer. Because there were many women and children, Huihui often couldn't sleep in these two small huts. Deng took Huihui to scout around everywhere. Whenever the women in other families were not too crowded when sleeping, Huihui would happily squeeze in to sleep. Everyone shouted, "Miss Yang! Miss Yang! You can't squeeze in anymore." By this time, Huihui had already fallen asleep.</p>
<p>But Huihui was always reluctant to talk much. She only smiled. When happy, she would widen her big eyes and speak loudly, laughing, and her two braids would swing violently left and right behind her head. Every three to five days, she would go with Deng and Deng's younger brother, taking workers, to the house to transport oil, salt, firewood, rice, and odds and ends. Deng's father's wine bottle was empty again, and suddenly his sister-in-law remembered that the child's shoes were still left at home. Huihui and the others would risk walking fifteen *li* to the house.</p>
<p>Although Huihui was very good at transporting things, it was not easy work. In the small town, there were all kinds of people, and they all had weapons. Once, Huihui and the other four were cleaning up some things at the house and carrying two bags of rice back to the mountain valley. Just as they locked the door and turned around to leave, a team came from the town in this direction. They had to bend down and move along a small path to a place with deep grass. But they had to cross this highway in any case to return to the mountain valley. They waited and waited, but the team was too long. When it was dusk, Huihui said she couldn't wait any longer and wanted to cross the highway. Seeing a soldier passing five or six steps ahead, and another soldier ten steps behind, Huihui suddenly jumped up, dashed across the highway, and stepped into the deep grass on the other side with her head down, scaring the two soldiers, who cursed, "Damn it!" After that, Deng, his younger brother, and the worker also crossed the highway in the same way. They returned to the small hut in the mountain valley, and it was already night. The whole family praised Huihui's courage.</p>
<p>Huihui loved her two braids the most. When sitting bored in the small hut, she would untangle them and ask her sister-in-law to comb them for her and braid them. After a month or two, everyone in Deng's family liked Huihui. Her sister-in-law also carefully braided her hair for her from time to time. Sometimes, she would sit silently with pursed lips. Deng's mother would also happily tease her, saying to her sister-in-law, "Miss Yang wants to have her hair braided?" Suddenly, one time after moving things back to the mountain valley, Huihui firmly asked her sister-in-law to cut off her two braids. When the people in the two small huts heard that Miss Yang was going to cut off her braids, they all gathered around in surprise. Everyone felt that it would be good to cut off the two braids, but they all knew that Huihui had deep feelings for these two braids, so although they agreed, they also expressed great regret. Some said, "Miss Yang doesn't need to cut them, right? The situation looks like it will get better soon." Deng walked in from outside and said, "Huihui, why do you have to cut them?" Huihui was hesitating. Hearing Deng say this, she said to Deng, "Why shouldn't I cut them? Is it better to cut them or to be raped? I want to cut them!" Her sister-in-law grabbed the scissors and stood behind Huihui, blushing at these words. She said anxiously, "Miss Yang, then I'll cut them." Huihui gritted her teeth and said, "Cut!" Two bright teardrops rolled down her face. Her sister-in-law took the two braids and walked out the door. Huihui fell on the bed and cried loudly.</p>
<p>It turned out that on this day when they went home to move things, they were chased by five soldiers. Huihui heard them say behind her, "There's a woman in front with two braids, hurry up and chase her?" Huihui knew the road well and escaped back, her heart pounding in her mouth. So she made up her mind to cut off her two braids. After that, Huihui's Western-style haircut was not Western-style at all, and the empty... people... all cast strange glances at her. Huihui didn't pay much attention to it at first, but later gradually became uneasy. Once, Deng and Huihui went out. Because it was late and there were many random gunshots, they did not return to the mountain valley. When they went back the next morning, they said they had spent the night at the house of another tenant farmer named Li. Her sister-in-law casually asked how they slept. The tenant farmer Li only had a tattered mattress. Deng said, "We two slept on one mattress." The people standing there were very surprised. "You two slept on one mattress?" Deng felt that he couldn't reason with these women. Without explaining, the story spread, and it spread very quickly.</p>
<p>When people nearby saw Deng and Huihui walking together, they quietly exchanged the same opinions, saying, "They've already slept together... but!" Saying this, everyone could not help but say at the same time, "They are still a couple, a fine couple."</p>
<p>In this situation, Huihui couldn't stay any longer. Hearing these words, she also blushed. Finally, Huihui said goodbye to Deng's father and left alone.</p>
<p>Her sister-in-law was very worried about Huihui and wanted Deng to escort Huihui out of the danger zone.</p>
<p>Huihui soon arrived in Chongqing. It is said that she got married this year.</p>
<p>After Deng saw Huihui off, he blamed himself very much, saying that he shouldn't have said such things casually in front of the neighbor woman. Country people don't understand young people.</p>
<p>Hearing the news of Huihui's marriage, Deng was very happy, but he always smiled and said to everyone he met, "Having a wife like Huihui is a lot of fun every day!"</p>

<h3>Recommending a Solo Concert</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>—Professor Lu Zhuhong, Baritone—</p>
<p>No matter how advanced instrumental music may be, the real and intimate feeling of vocal music is often incomparable to the expression of purely instrumental music. If you do not know how to appreciate wonderful vocal music, you will not know the "magic" of music.</p>
<p>Everyone can learn vocal music, but only a few people can become singers, because the innate vocal cords determine everything. In China, because people are generally weaker, generally speaking, innate conditions make their pronunciation smaller, weaker, and looser than Westerners, without the solidity, strength, and power of Westerners. This can be distinguished in ordinary language pronunciation. Therefore, we can say this: Chinese people learning vocal music need more genius and more hard work.</p>
<p>There are not many Chinese singers, but in recent Shanghai, there have been many personal solo concerts. How their results are, I dare not say anything wrong, but it can be asserted that there are many geniuses among them. Those who have heard Si Yigui's baritone are very satisfied, and enthusiastic audiences hope that he can make more progress after going to the United States, not letting "Lawrence Tibbett" be uniquely beautiful. At the same time, we hope for more Si Yigui, better Si Yigui.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to recommend another unique genius—Professor Lu Zhuhong, a baritone singer. He has put in nine years of hard work in vocal music and is a top student of the famous master Su Shilin in Shanghai. Simply put, judging from his appearance, it may already be determined that he is physically qualified. Just like Mr. Xu Mianqing, the director of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, his appearance is already a model of a good baritone.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu is a "dramatic baritone." Those who have heard him sing praise his large vocal range and beautiful timbre. In his technique, all aspects are very rich. Whether it is timbre, sound quality, or expression, they are beyond the reach of general poor singers. The success of any singer is mostly due to the "richness" of the performance in all aspects. Because it can be "rich," it can then express "strength." The quality of music depends on "strength."</p>
<p>Singing small songs is easy, singing arias in operas is difficult. A good singer can handle these arias with ease and without effort. Lu Zhuhong's achievement lies in his wide vocal range and rich volume and expression. Even for the most difficult aria in the opera "Pagliacci," he doesn't care much. Therefore, this introduction is not intended to be an exaggerated sales pitch!</p>
<p>On the evenings of the 27th and 28th, this rich and powerful "dramatic baritone" will appear at the Lyceum. In addition to several large programs such as arias from "Un ballo in maschera" and Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci," there will also be the most popular folk song "Song of the Volga Boatmen," Chinese songs, etc. I think these wonderful performances will make countless music fans be intoxicated by the "magic of sound."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 133</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Then, who told you my address?"</p>
<p>"Teacher Aoki."</p>
<p>"Oh…"! Tsurumi became a little more agitated again, "Who gave Elder Aoki the message?"</p>
<p>"You, honored one, yourself"!</p>
<p>"Who?" Tsurumi thought he had misheard.</p>
<p>"Big brother, yourself"! Pingzi repeated.</p>
<p>"Nonsense"! Tsurumi spoke without choosing his words, blurting out these two words. At that moment, he felt that the impact of these two words was too great. He immediately wanted to change his words and apologize for explaining, but he heard a special surprised cry from the other party on the phone. It was like resentment and surprise. This made Tsurumi stunned there, not knowing how to explain, and the other party seemed to be stunned as well, as if chewing on the meaning of these two words.</p>
<p>Tsurumi casually said these two words, which were very ordinary, so why did they deserve such... rudeness? He did not know that since Tsurumi and Pingzi had talked under the moon at the beach last night, Tsurumi had decided to use a "respectful" attitude to deal with Pingzi's entanglement. But it was not a method of "respectfully keeping a distance," because Tsurumi felt that Pingzi's talent and status could indeed be used, but he could not get too close to her. Getting too close would give Pingzi a chance to fall in love. Therefore, it was best to maintain a considerable distance between him and her. In this distance, he would build a wall of "respect" to isolate the path of talking about love.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this good "trick," which had taken a lot of effort to plan, was unintentionally destroyed by himself under this sudden phone call. "Nonsense," from one point of view, was too disrespectful. From another point of view, it was too close, as close as the tone of family members, fathers and sons, close friends, and lovers speaking. Neither too disrespectful nor too close was appropriate for Tsurumi.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry, Pingzi... Because I didn't rest all night, my nerves didn't listen to me, and I used such inappropriate words:"!</p>
<p>"Happy…? Why shouldn't you? Hmm…? But I also know… you think it's not appropriate to be so casual with me… In short, you still treat me as an annoying outsider… I also know that you will never give me a chance…" Her voice was a little off, as if she was starting to feel sad?</p>
<p>"...Hey… Ah… Pingzi, you…" Tsurumi couldn't think of a suitable excuse for a moment.</p>
<p>"Big brother, you're very busy, don't let me delay your business with idle talk. Please write down a few words that Teacher Aoki asked me to pass on to you…"! There was no sound of speaking below, but it was the password tapped on the phone with fingernails.</p>
<p>As soon as Tsurumi heard this password method, he couldn't help but be greatly surprised, because what Pingzi used was the special password that Tsurumi invented and thought was impossible to decipher. So he quickly wrote it down:</p>
<p>"Yu'er, your plan will definitely have no results, moreover someone has already started ahead of time; the purpose is different, the goals are listed as one. Therefore, you should end everything and return to the mainland as soon as possible, and never advance rashly. The current situation has already formed and is difficult to reverse. This is what I deduced using the Zhou Tian Xuan Gong mathematics. You must believe it. Hao Ran Old Man Inoue Aoki, showed."</p>
<p>This password was the crystallization of Tsurumi's hard work. The hidden meaning of the song lines were all in his mind. As soon as he saw the number, he immediately wrote out the text. Fearing that the number was wrong, he immediately asked Pingzi to tap it again to correct any errors.</p>
<p>"Pingzi, I have another question, can you please explain it?"</p>
<p>"I know"! Pingzi laughed again, "You want to know where Teacher Aoki found out your secret from, don't you?"</p>
<p>"You guessed right, please tell me."</p>
<p>"It's the same old saying, the one who told him everything was big brother, yourself."</p>
<p>"Again using mysterious techniques?"</p>
<p>"That's right. At eight o'clock this morning. He used me as a medium to perform a hypnosis; at that time, you were probably still asleep, so the result was very good. There was no need to force it at all. You said everything in your heart."</p>
<h3>A Saint and a Sinner: The Love Story of George Eliot</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yu Jing</p>
<p>Hollywood is hesitant, the reason being that they want to film a historical movie about the Victorian female novelist George Eliot. The directors want to produce a film about the life of this famous novelist, but they can't decide which George Eliot they should emulate.</p>
<p>Should this film portray the George Eliot known to readers worldwide through her works? Her readers consider her a guardian of the strict morality of the time. In her works, a moral transgression is an irredeemable sin, and anyone who commits an improper act should atone with their life.</p>
<p>Or should this film portray the life of Marian Evans (translator's note: this is her real name) as known to many neighbors near the peaceful Royal Park in London? In the eyes of her neighbors, this famous novelist was a lewd woman who lived openly with another man's wife without shame, residing near the home of that legal wife.</p>
<p>But this peculiar female writer did not concern herself with whether future Hollywood directors would consider the contradictions in her double life. She firmly believed in the morality in her own works, but she was equally convinced that the love of the man who could never marry her was the only happiness the world gave her.</p>
<p>Just as George Sand had her Chopin, George Eliot also had her George Henry Lewes.</p>
<p>If a slick philanderer were to speak, Marian Evans was not a captivating girl. When she fell in love and was recognized as a scandal in London's literary circles at the time, she was already over thirty. Although she had a slender and healthy figure and a dignified face, she couldn't quite be called a beauty. Because she often browsed Greek and Latin literature, philosophy, and sociology, her large, blue-green eyes were somewhat nearsighted.</p>
<p>When she met Lewes at the home of a mutual friend, Chapman, she was only editing and translating ancient texts and had not yet thought of becoming a creative novelist. They developed feelings for each other not long after they met, and their relationship lasted twenty-five years. This is not something a fickle girl could achieve through mere impulse. Lewes was said to have a slim figure, thick curly hair, delicate mustache and eyebrows, and was not without a hint of handsomeness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lewes's wife often went out with good friends, leaving him to raise three children. At that time, the nature hidden within George Eliot's strict Puritan spirit and the nature of that agile essayist merged together. They gained immense benefit and joy from each other and brought their achievements to the highest point.</p>
<p>This is an excerpt from a passage in the biography of George Eliot in the famous women's biographies written by W. Schilder, Brandes, which describes how the famous female writer of the time despised Victorian English morality and fell in love with that man, while also making a protective yet regretful evaluation of George Eliot's behavior.</p>
<p>"When Lewes was thirty years old, he had already engaged in criticism, novels, biographies, dramas, and philosophical research. He had traveled abroad, and as a result, his experience of human nature was very rich. He also stood on the podium and spoke to the crowds, and he also engaged in arduous and interesting reporting work. It is said that he also served as a clown in a traveling troupe.</p>
<p>"Because he was lively by nature and spoke freely, his passionate, absurd, and indulgent conversations and attitudes sometimes aroused the interest of friends and sometimes surprised them."</p>
<p>"When George Eliot met this man, unusual waves arose in her heart. She felt that this man was absolutely different from the men she had seen in her youth living in Warwickshire and in the abbey where she grew up. She realized that a crisis had come into her life. She had to make a decision in private to guide her behavior, and this was not based on the general standards of morality in England at the time, but on the harmony of her inner beliefs."</p>
<p>"Presumably Mr. Lewes wrote a letter to her explaining his situation and urging Miss Evans to be his lifelong companion. Later, she agreed because she believed that it did not infringe on the rights of others. She became his wife, but could not become a legal wife because he could not with</p>
<p>"This caused great shock among her friends. For example, Mrs. Bray and her sister gradually restored their close friendship after understanding that her conscience was still so perfect."</p>
<p>"George Eliot was such an extremely sensitive woman that this matter must have caused her particularly painful suffering. She did not realize that her behavior was wrong. She gained perfect spiritual friendship from the man she loved. But taking such a bold step caused a deep rift between her and many relatives, which was enough to disturb her brave nature. Her companions were very awed by her seriousness, but she defied morality for love, causing great panic among her companions, like a thunderbolt from the blue."</p>
<p>When she called herself "Mrs. Lewes," it was considered the third time she had changed her name without legal approval. Her given name was Mary Ann, which she changed to Marian, reportedly because the latter was more beautiful.</p>
<p>Her male pen name, George Eliot, was probably not only to hide her real name but also to avoid being discovered about her affair with Lewes. But this wish was broken after her famous work, Adam Bede, was printed.</p>
<p>In 1858, Mr. McArthur said in her biography: "Everyone is guessing, but most are guessing wrong. Because everyone is paying attention to George Eliot's book, Scenes of Clerical Life."</p>
<p>Mr. McArthur wrote in her biography: "At the time, only Charles Dickens pointed to this secret clue and said: If these two volumes of novels were not written by a woman, I would be willing to admit that I am a woman!"</p>
<p>A year later, the secret was revealed. That was the publication of Adam Bede, with the first inscription written: "To my dear husband, George Henry Lewes."</p>
<p>Those inscriptions said: "Dedicated to my dear husband, George Henry Lewes, if his love had not given my life happiness, I would never have been able to write these manuscripts. Marian Lewes." (Translated from magazine digests)</p>
<h3>Compassion</h3>
<p>— Millais</p>
<p>Millais (E. Millais 1829-1896) was an outstanding talent among 19th-century British figure painters, as famous as Rossetti and considered a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His noble character and poetic decorative atmosphere are expressed in his paintings. This painting, originally titled Mercy-Saint Bartholomew's day, depicts a scene of a massacre during the French religious revolution. The emotions are realistic, and the composition is tight, which can be said to be a representative work of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. (Lion)</p>

<h3>Sugar and Dance</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A female employee of the Sullivan Candy Company told me:</p>
<p>On the day before Saint Jean (the 24th), chocolate alone sold for more than 1.7 million yuan in one afternoon. Many customers waited in front of the counter. As soon as the factory delivered it, it was snapped up before it was even unpacked. The factory couldn't produce enough, otherwise, they would have sold even more.</p>
<p>She told me this, and I wasn't surprised at all. I coldly asked her: How much does chocolate cost per pound? She said 10,000 yuan. I said, it's just over 1,700 pounds, what's so strange about that?</p>
<p>Indeed, there are too many people in Shanghai who can afford 10,000 yuan a pound of chocolate, and it's more than just these 1,700 people.</p>
<p>From the small to the big, the consumption in other aspects this Christmas is really unknown!</p>
<p>However, the market is still sluggish. On Christmas Eve, around ten o'clock, I went to visit a large dance hall with a few friends. There were few customers seated. Although the musicians were playing enthusiastically, the desolate atmosphere could not be dispelled after all. The dancers said when they saw customers: Business is bad! Compared to today last year, this situation is really unbearable to look back on.</p>
<p>The above two examples can be said to be a unity of contradictions, fully illustrating the economic chaos of Shanghai society. Mencius said: Food and sex are human nature. Food is still in the first place. If you look at it from the surface, Shanghainese would rather eat sugar than dance. In terms of economics, one pound of chocolate can benefit everyone equally, while a moment of pleasure in the dance hall costs far more than 10,000 yuan and only pleases one person.</p>
<p>But this cannot be used as an explanation of the current economic situation.</p>

<p>In San Jose, California, a man requested a divorce, accusing his wife of taking her beloved monkey to bed every night. The judge, however, sided with his wife and gave her the rights she deserved, because the judge believed that if a man did not have the courage and ability to kick a little monkey out of bed, could that man be considered a "real man"?</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 19</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Street Performing Begging (Part 1)</p>
<p>In the local hard-core beggar gang, their popular begging methods still follow the traditions of the underworld. The factions are divided into eighteen categories, called "Eighteen Underworld Types." The following is a list and explanation: —</p>
<p>(1) "Singing the Emotions"—This is a refined singing beggar gang, including those who sing "Withered Flowers." Its tools are divided into "three woods" and "leather cylinder." The three woods are used to sing "Withered Flowers," and its fixed lyrics encompass everything. The beggar must sing the lyrics of that industry when he walks to the door of each industry's shop. And it must be appropriate and not perfunctory by putting Zhang's hat on Li's head. If the shop does not give him money, he will also ridicule a few words in the lyrics, and even do vicious curses. The shopkeepers can't do anything about it. The "leather cylinder" is used to sing Daoqing. It is considered a civilized class and requires a long shirt to show its different class. He does not take money with his hands, but uses a cylinder board to clamp it into the cylinder. This is the rule of the gang. The lyrics are indeed in the Daoqing tune, and the materials are also based on ancient people's deeds. Shopkeepers are happy to give alms when they encounter beggars singing Daoqing because these people are neat and tidy and not annoying. But to be able to sing the lyrics, you must be literate and eloquent, and you must be able to adapt to the situation. Those who are not literate enough are not qualified to serve.</p>
<p>(2) "Swallowing Swords and Bullets"—This faction is also called "Family Hands." Its behavior is similar to "Shandong people changing tricks, wanting money but not life." They scare people by swallowing swords and iron bullets. Swallowing swords is called "long strips," and swallowing bullets is called "containing balls." When this faction of beggars comes to the door, they all say, "Boss, please give me some." Don't say anything else. They leave when they are given money. If they don't give it, they use a two-foot-long knife or a walnut-sized iron bullet to insert directly into the throat. Then tears and snot come out together. They refuse to run unless they are given more money.</p>
<p>(3) "Soft and Hard Martial Arts"—This gang is divided into two factions: soft and hard. "Soft Martial Arts" beggars carry small eighteen weapons with them, and use guns to stand upright on the top of their heads. "Hard Martial Arts" beggars do not carry weapons, but when they go to shops and homes, they can take any object and hold it on the tip of their nose without letting it fall. Large gate bolts weighing more than ten pounds and extremely sharp meat axes can be held. This relies on real talent and skill, which cannot be compared with soft martial arts.</p>
<p>(4) "Water Flower Bowl"—It is said to be a technical performance similar to a underworld troupe, divided into two factions: "Big Flower" and "Small Flower." "Big Flower" uses two large bowls of water and ties them with ropes. They are swung left and right to form a round shape. It is considered a real skill if the water does not drip. "Small Flower" uses a bowl to stick the paste, and there is a hook at one end. The hook is planted on the arm, and a bowl of water is held. The arm is dripping with blood, which makes people pitifully give him money. In fact, a small hole has long been made in the arm, the same as a woman's ear piercing for earrings. When going out, some pig blood is smeared on it, and it is like a new stab. This can be said to be "man-made blood," just to deceive passers-by.</p>
<p>(5) "Real and Fake Dogs"—This faction takes dogs out to beg for money, calling dogs "strips." In the beggar gang, they are considered the big brother. It is not something that young beggars can abuse. They rely on dogs to eat, calling dogs "wooden money." They can only go to the streets to respond to the market after they have been tamed. They run when they are told to run, and jump when they are told to jump, to win the hearts of the people in the shops and homes. In addition, there is a beggar who puts on a dog head to beg, and also sings a song of dog barking: —</p>
<p>"Woof woof has money!</p>
<p>Omm omm dog comes rich!</p>
<p>Boss, give money to raise 玀."</p>
<p>These people actually voluntarily transform themselves into dogs to seek money. The behavior is unbearable. The gang calls it "pretending to jump" no different from beasts in clothing.</p>
<h3>Women in the Eyes of Scientists</h3>
<p>— Yun Bei</p>
<p>I recently obtained a magazine from a friend, and when I opened it, it turned out to be the annual journal of the Engineering Society of the University of London this year. There is a short article analyzing women using "scientific methods", and the content is very "cute". I translated it to fill the "Free Talk".</p>
<p>Element: Woman.</p>
<p>Existence: Can be found wherever men exist.</p>
<p>Very rarely exists in an uncombined free state. With few exceptions, it has been combined with other objects.</p>
<p>Physical properties: Color, shape, size, and age of generation are not fixed.</p>
<p>The surface is covered with a thin layer of grease.</p>
<p>It can be made to freeze (emotions) at any time, but it can be refreshed by appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Chemical properties: Very active.</p>
<p>Extremely fond of combining with valuable items such as gold, silver, platinum, and expensive minerals.</p>
<p>When left alone, it turns blue.</p>
<p>Insoluble in water, but its activity will be greatly enhanced if ethanol (alcohol) is combined with it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it does not exert resistance (Pressure).</p>
<p>Extremely perishable, the appearance will change greatly in ten years. Fresh ones have great magnetic force. Precautions: In the hands of inexperienced people, this element is similar to high-grade explosives.</p>
<h3>What is "Autumn Stone"? Explanation of Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>On the 21st, I saw an article in this newspaper "Stealing Urine to Make Secret Medicine," which talked about making "Autumn Stone," which I felt was not detailed enough, so I supplemented it at this time.</p>
<p>According to Chinese medicine, there are three kinds of medicines made from human urine: (1) Urine. (2) Urinary White Turbidity. (3) That is, "Autumn Stone".</p>
<p>The urine prescription is called reincarnation wine or reduction soup by the prescriptionists. The prescription books record that it has many curative effects, but in fact, it is effective for treating bruises and injuries, and other claims are exaggerated.</p>
<p>The medicine for urinary white turbidity is called man-in-white, which is used as an essential medicine in the Chinese medicine throat department, and also treats diabetes, but Chinese medicine practitioners rarely use it in internal prescriptions.</p>
<p>As for the name of Autumn Stone, it is actually borrowed. It is the essence of the alchemists' refining of elixirs. Because of its white and firm color, it is named "Autumn Stone." Therefore, Huainanzi said: "The elixir is called Autumn Stone"</p>
<p>As for the crystallization made from urine, the shape and color are the same as those refined by the alchemists, so it is also called "Autumn Stone." How is urine made into Autumn Stone? The Compendium of Materia Medica by Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty explains it in detail. It is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Autumn Stone must be taken from boy's urine in the autumn month. Add seven cents of gypsum powder to each jar and use mulberry branches to clarify. Pour off the clear liquid, do this two or three times, then add a bucket of autumn dew water and stir to clarify: do this several times to remove the residue and reduce the salty taste. Spread heavy paper on the ash and dry it in the sun, completely take the light and clear one on top as "Autumn Stone". Scrape off the heavy and turbid one below. The ancients established this meaning. Use virgin girl's urine for men, and virgin boy's urine for women." Only such a preparation can be called authentic. In addition, there are some unscrupulous merchants who make crude and shoddy products with tricky methods:</p>
<p>"... Doctors in the world do not take autumn time, but collect human urine and clarify and dry it with soapberry water and refine it as Yang refining, completely losing the Tao, how can it be in line with the name! Meddling for profit ruins people, how can it respond to illness?" The same forged inferior products also have those made by modifying man-in-white, which is harmful and useless to take, and is even more expected.</p>
<p>The effect of this product is stated in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "It mainly treats deficiency, labor, cold diseases, frequent urination, spermatorrhea, leucorrhea, nourishes kidney water, nourishes Dantian, restores the original state, returns to the root and restores life, calms the five viscera, moisturizes the three Jiao, eliminates phlegm and cough, reduces bone steaming, softens hard lumps, brightens the eyes and clears the heart..." (But very few doctors and users use it.)</p>
<p>Ordinary swollen patients should avoid salt, so some people use Autumn Stone instead of salt to cook dishes for patients. If this product is regarded as a fairy elixir for prolonging life, then nothing could be more foolish!</p>
<p>In the major national medicine stores, you can buy a piece the size of one or two coins for one or two thousand yuan. Its shape is quite like rock candy. Why don't you knowledgeable gentlemen buy a piece to see, if there are medical scientists or chemists who study its composition and medicinal effects, so that we people can avoid many suspicions! (Li Renzhong)</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wan</p>
<p>There is a large open space in front of the Huangpu Branch Bureau facing Jinling East Road. This place is located in the central district and has good feng shui. If the city government and the police bureau allow vendors to set up stalls here, isn't it really giving them strong assistance? In this way, on the one hand, it shows the measures given to vendors by the authorities? On the other hand, it can also show that the vendors and the police have made peace, everyone is smiling, the accumulated anger has been eliminated, and harmony brings wealth!</p>
<p>However, let me state: I am not a vendor.</p>
<h3>This is a Panoramic View of the Coast of San Francisco</h3>
<p>(1) is Angel Island, (2) is Alcatraz Island, where the Federal Penitentiary is located, (3) is the location of the Military Shipyard, (4) is the military garrison. This magnificent land was once considered the best site for the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Gan Naiguang</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>"Down with the great powers, down with the great powers, eliminate the warlords, eliminate the warlords, the National Revolution succeeds, the National Revolution succeeds, rejoice, rejoice together."</p>
<p>The author of this well-known National Revolution song, known even to women and children, is none other than Mr. Gan Naiguang, the current Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was hurriedly drafted in 1925 before the Central Party Headquarters held a party congress in Guangzhou. From this, one can get a glimpse of his talent.</p>
<p>Mr. Gan once served as a political instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy. He is not only adept at finding words, but his writing is also fluent and readable. In the past, he deeply earned the trust of the martyr Liao Zhongkai. Mr. Gan is currently 50 years old and a native of Cenxi County, Guangxi. He is a graduate of Lingnan University, a private university in Guangzhou. After graduation, he served as a professor of economics at the university. He is the author of "A History of Pre-Qin Economic Thought" and "Several Fundamental Problems of the Chinese Kuomintang," and his translated works include "A History of British Political Parties" and "An Outline of Art Photography." His talent and learning can be described as extensive. In addition, he has written many small pamphlets on party affairs, earning him the title of "Theorist of the Three Principles of the People." At that time, his prominence even surpassed that of the "old guard" theorist Dai Jitao and others.</p>
<p>He enjoys photography and composing new poetry. His accomplishments in the former have already reached the ranks of experts.</p>
<p>This summer, he was appointed as China's special envoy to attend the celebration of Philippine independence. He has recently developed a hobby of collecting stamps.</p>
