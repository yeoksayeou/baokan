<h3>舞女口中露出秘密　日藏匿大量白金圖作「復興日本」之資本　盟軍正在東京灣內打撈</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>未來兩週中的東北</h3>
<p>據合衆社重劇七日電，觀察家今日預料稱，北平執行部調處小組能否挽救東北大規模戰事之爆發，蘇軍退出東北之諾言，其誠意是否能與國軍之接收工作順利進行，將於此後兩週內作爲嚴重之試騐。又該社六日電稱，觀察家正密切注意未來十日中之東北局勢發展情形，認爲此事與未來數年之局勢有重大關係。我們老百姓，如果不被「勝利」冲昏了頭腦，就妄想高枕無憂，那末對道局勢漸形嚴重的東北，當不致漠然無動於中罷。</p>
<p>重慶的軍事三人小組，原定五日飛平轉赴瀋陽，但迄今尙未有出發消息，而昨晚爲止所得的電訊，且盛傳三人小組東北之行已無期延期，即在重慶亦未進行開會，由平出發的執行小組雖赴東北，但所謂「共軍」已在長春市郊結集六七萬人，其前鋒距城僅七八公里，並不斷派遣便衣隊潛入市區，哈爾濱亦極度緊張，各地軍事衝突迄未停止，且反有擴大之勢。大概長春蘇軍定十五日撤完，哈市蘇軍定廿五日撤完，吉林市定十六日撤完，齊齊哈爾定廿七日撤完，而所謂「共軍」者就久已蓄意在蘇軍撤走一地，即進佔一地，以妨得國民政府恢復國家主權的行動。我們爲了收復東北，纔有八年的血戰，而今好容易得到勝利，却竟有人利用外力，掩護他們害國殃民的工作，實在不能加以寬恕的。</p>
<p>本來，一個國家的軍令政令，應該絕對統一。一國之內，而容許黨派擁有軍隊，甚至進一步承認共軍爲一單位，對共軍與政府軍隊之間執行調處，站在嚴正的軍紀立塲來講，已經是笑話奇談。可是國民政府爲貫澈和平停止衝突起見，爲讓戰後的老百姓早得休養生息起見，居然同意設立軍事調處執行部，並由軍事二人小組商定整編國軍及統編中共部隊加入國軍的基本方案，予共軍以正大光明的出路和效忠祖國的機會，總算仁至義盡的了。按照一月十日政府與中共代表在馬歇爾特使協助之下所商定的停止衝突及恢復交通的辦法，原是規定「停止衝突命令第二節，對於國民政府軍隊爲恢復主權而開入東北九省，或在東北九省境內調動，並不影饗。」可見就對內言，所謂軍事調處的辦法，原本並不適用於東北。更就對外來說，依照中蘇友好同盟條約的精神及其附件的規定，蘇聯政府應以國民政府爲援助的對象，而接收東北主權尤其是國民政府無可旁貸的職實。所以蘇軍旣聲明於四月底自東北撤退完畢，就道義講，就條約講，蘇軍對於中國國民政府換防軍隊應有予以便利與協助的義務。但目前情况，顯然蘇軍撇退的時候，正是中共所謂「民主聯軍」在東北各地蠢動已達準備成熟階段的時候，中共部隊不讓國軍能够順利達成接收東北主權的任務，眞所謂司馬昭之心，路人皆知。中共企圖外與蘇聯呼應，把原是外交問題的東北局勢，轉化成爲一個中國內部的政治糾紛問題，即可藉此以欺矇全世界的人士。但爲中蘇友好計，蘇聯有遠見的政治家，不宜受中共的蠱惑。不過事態儘管由中共弄得這樣複雜，我們應該始終認定東北間題的性質。我們站在純粹國民的地位，萬不容許任何黨派或個人，在此時際向政府談判要挾，憑蘇其來歷不明的武力，擅自割據東北，阻撓國家主權的收復，妨碍國家行政的完整。不管「民主聯軍」也好，「民選政府」也好，在國民政府接收東北主權推行國家的行政權力以前，一切都絕無承認的餘地。國民政府如果不堅持此一立塲，誠恐將有噬臍莫及的一天！</p>
<p>東北是中國的寳藏，東北是中國的生命綫。我們中國人民，爲了東北，不知流了多少血，吃了多少苦。我們中國人民，爲了東北，首先揭起全世界反侵略的大旗，不顧一切與暴日抗爭，而今勝利半年，東北的工廠機件被搬空了！東北的礦場被破壞了’東北的房屋被拆毀了！東北的物資被盜刦了！東北的交通不是被破壞就是被阻塞了！東北接收的人員不是被慘殺就是被擋駕了！好容易現在蘇軍因屢經交涉的結果而撤退，却依然不能讓國民政府順利的接收主權施行政令，只要眞正是中國人，沒有不痛心的；只要眞正是中國人，沒有不切齒的。</p>
<p>蘇聯馬林諾夫斯基元帥在離去長春以前，一再強調中蘇友好相處之重要性及必然性；蘇京消息報也說中國爲蘇聯之鄰邦，素與蘇聯保有友誼。我們爲東北和平計，爲逮東和平計，爲世界和平計，我們的確始終與蘇聯同感，以爲中蘇的友好關係應該百分之百的維持。但友好必須有友好的眞正基礎，友好必須有友好的眞正對象。我們願率直向蘇聯當局和人民貢獻兩句話：（一）中蘇友好的基礎應建築在「中蘇友好同盟條約」的字句上和精神上，應建築在兩國當局和人民的誠意上。（二）中蘇友好的對象，就政府言，在蘇聯爲史太林元帥所領導的政府，在中國爲蔣主席所領導的國民政府；就人民言，在蘇聯應爲愛好和平的全蘇聯人民，在中國亦應爲愛好和平的全中國人民。因此，蘇聯與其只想市恩於中國共產黨，何如推誠見信於全中國人民？蘇聯與其將撤兵以後的東北給中共以割據的方便，何如按照盟約精神協助國民政府完成接收主權的任務？我們願眞正看見中蘇之間的友好至少有三十年，能更延長更好；但我們千萬不希望中蘇友好也像過去日本人在中日之間所常說的「親善」一樣。只有中蘇的眞誠友好，只有蘇聯眞正協助國民政府，也只有中國在東北主權領土的完整收復，纔是東北和平遠東和平乃至世界和平的有力保障，豈但未來兩週中的東北不會有什麼問題而已。杏則東北蘇軍全部撤退之日，即將是中共騷擾割據之時！果爾，中國人民對中共固不能寬恕其害國殃民的罪惡，即對友好同盟的蘇聯，早不撤兵，遲不撤兵，必待縱容中共的非法部隊準備阻擾國軍接收工作之時實行撤兵，而不履行協助國民政府的義務，也不能不感覺很大的遺憾！</p>

<h3>最近期內可實現　開放百餘處倉庫　所儲大量敵偽物資公開標售或拍賣　敵偽產業處理局負責人談接收情形</h3>
<p>敵僞產業處理局爲出淸倉庫及以大量物資供應市面，於最近期內，將開放敵僞倉庫一百廿餘處，將內儲物資，公開標售或拍賣。此項倉庫出淸以後，將儲放善後救濟總署之救濟物資，及刻正啓運來華之太平洋區美軍剩餘物資。此種措施，衆信對於抑平物價，可收宏效。記者爲明瞭此舉之眞相，特走訪該局負責人，據稱：本局成立於勝利後兩月又半，五月來幸承各方匡助，工作得見推進，其犖犖大者爲：（一）碼頭倉庫在海關沒有聯合辦事處，另有憲兵一連及稅警，分駐各倉庫，協同護衛，載至三月十七止，計有海關加封管理者一一三六倉庫。（二）淸點竣事者，一〇八七倉庫，業經海關編送淸點報吿到局者，九〇〇倉庫，餘在淸點編册中。盟國商民倉庫，約二百座。已淸點物資，發還原主者，的半數。華商及銀行業倉庫一三九處，正積極淸理，鑑別物資，分別發還，或分別性質，依照規定，委託各機關團體或由本局逐倉標賣，預料四月底以前，能騰空全部倉庫二分之一至三分之二。（三）工廠業經經濟部接收者，贓六二六單位。撥交資委會·紡織委員會·中蠶公司·衛生署·糧食部等接收者，共一四二單位；已發還者，總計一四八單位；已復工者，共一〇三廠；由經濟部特派員辦公處提出，即可標賣之工廠，共二一七廠。（四）已委託中央信託局接收之房地產，有八百餘單位，房屋一六二〇幢，地產一千餘畝，均以出售爲原則。（五）固體及液體燃料，品類複雜，經燃料管委員接收者，汽油佔一〇八〇桶，烟煤五五·五九五·九五〇噸，無烟煤一四二·一九四·一七五噸。（六）盟方官商申請發還小汽車一三二輛。空中運輸，已由航委會接收機塲七處，飛機一七〇架。（七）糧食以麵粉·苞米·蠶豆·高梁爲多，業經糧食部特派員接收，將舉行第三次雜糧公開標賣。（七）敎育文化機關共計二百十九單位。又稱：上海部份接收之敵僞產業，截至二月二十日止，業經初步估價，總値共約六千零七十餘億。此項估價，大都從低，且係以三十四年十二月底之上海市價爲標準。</p>

<h3>解決本市電力嚴重問題　上海電力公司　擬定三年計劃　昨宴市府長官臨時參議員　午後並往發電廠各部參觀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海電力公司總裁賀淸曁總經理費禮思等，昨日中午，在國際飯店十四樓宴請本市臨時參議員及市府長官，到錢市長，徐寄廎，各局局長，參議員等六十餘人。席間由賀氏致詞，報吿該公司業務並請谷參議員隨時指敎，務使本市電力問題，達到圓滿地步旋由錢市長，徐寄　，趙曾珏等，相繼致詞，表示答謝電力公司爲本市市民服務之功績，由工務局副局長王繩善翻譯，三時半散席，即前往楊樹浦該公司發電廠參觀，分十人一小組，由該廠工程師領導解釋各部工作情形。先至蒸汽冷却房，繼至運煤處，鍋爐間，發電間，總管理處，電們間等各部參觀。該廠規模宏大，各部均由機器工作僅需極少數之工人管理加油校表等工作，顯爲極進步之工塲組織。惟勝利前，盟機曾炸中發電間，發電機一部全毁，一部半毀，現正加以修理。又有發電機一部，被敵人拆去，運往日本，尙有捷克製斯可達機一部，係戰前裝就，但迄今未使用，敵人管理期間，曾擬開用，因不明使用方法，致被損毁多處。此機高發電能力極强，但現時如欲加以修理，須全部運往捷克本廠，重行裝配。際此戰後，歐洲交通多未恢復，故搬運捷克該修之計劃，一時無法實行。該公司自九月十七日以來，即負起閘北，華商及浦東三公司之全部供電任務，發電總容量約爲一二三，〇〇〇瓩，而存煤常祇足一二日或數小時之用，幸由中美當局設法協助，接濟均得及時趕到，但此種情形，不能作爲長久之計尙希全市市民共同合作，節省電力，並望華商·浦東·閘北等售電公司，竭力協助。現法商水電公司，則尙可供應一小部份電力。至經濟方面，該公司自接收以來，虧損總額已超出三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。今後擬定三年計劃，以解決本市嚴重之電力問題：（一）上海電力公司在美國製造中之材料，均須迅速空運來滬（二）閘北水電公司之一萬瓩發電機一座，應迅速修竣應用。（三）現由宋院長洽購之二四，〇〇〇瓩水上發電機須供上海之用。（四）上海電力公司須購得並裝置二萬瓩之低壓發電機一座，及一萬五千瓩高壓發電機一座。（五）在美修理之二二，五〇〇瓩發電織轉動于須　修竣送回上海。如此，則一九四六年發電量可增至二〇〇，〇〇〇〇，一九四七年至二〇四，五〇〇瓩，一九四八年可增至二三九，五〇〇瓩。</p>

<h3>扒竊「世家本紀」　小偷沐猴而冠　冒充政府要員　巧竊公文包遠走山西　他鄕遇知音捲土重來　冒名印信紙奸謀洩漏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕著名扒竊綽號小河北陳其明，現年二十五歲，以扒竊爲常業，犯案纍纍。在一個月以前，陳犯又扒得一公事皮包，經察閱之下，其中均屬軍統局之重要公文，並有軍統局最高負責人戴故局長之信件一封。依據是項公文之考證，斷定遺失是項重要公文者，爲軍統局高級職員齊一民。小河北陳其明遂異想天開，竟藉是項重要公文爲護符，公然冒充軍統局名義，有所企圖。</p>
<p>惟陳犯以滬上犯案鼎櫐纍，且熟識其面貌者衆，殊未便永久立足，乃隻身挾帶上項重要公文，又冒刻「國民政府軍事委員會調査室」鈴記，曁戴局長私章各一顆，潛往山西方面大肆活動。竟藉此由「小竊」一躍而儼然爲「官長」。嗣在山西方面又結識小竊名孫子高者，（年十九歲，河南人，亦以扒竊爲生，在滬犯案兩次，）兩人因情投意合，相互勾結。</p>
<p>直至最近，陳孫兩犯結伴第二次潛來上海，寓居九江路四九一號山東旅社十一號房間，一面至某印刷所私印「軍委會調査室」大批信紙信封，以備携赴山西應用。不意適有軍統局人員亦在該印刷所委印其他物品，瞥見陳犯所印大批信箋，深以爲異。比經返局轉詢局方，並無人托印是項印刷品，至此斷定確爲私印企圖不法無疑。當派遣人員暗中在該印刷所守候，迨陳犯前往取件時，即予拘捕。</p>
<p>嗣經軍統局嚴密偵審之下，陳犯知難隱瞞，直認僞造文書不諱。並將以上經過，和盤托出。旋又經馳往山東旅社，續獲同黨孫子高，一鞠而服。該局以案關假冒名義，擅刻鈴記等項，實屬愍不畏法。當將兩犯併解淞滬警備總司令部，依法訊辦。</p>

<h3>刦後龍華</h3>
<p>闊別龍華垂八稔，</p>
<p>刦餘風物益堪憐；</p>
<p>東瀛爛熳櫻花節，</p>
<p>何似春江古寺前。</p>
<p>若其</p>
<p>龍華說得更確切些，龍華古寺和龍華塔，似乎已成了上海人心目中的麥卡（Mecca。每届春節假日香汛時期，少不了是塊必去的地方。可是畢竟也跳不了侵略者的魔掌，寺院給打得七零八落，幸運的是那座七級高塔，還沒遭到刦運。而盛個寺院的復興整修工程，還是在民國卅二年的秋天，得到黃金榮大護法張方賡居士等的協助，才開始發動的。現在據說工程已完成十分之八，記者正想找個機會，去一親新生龍華的面貌。</p>
<p>昨天龍華古寺都監釋世賓，招待了一次新聞界。記者跟龍華一別八年，此番舊地重臨，眞是別有一番滋味在心頭。龍華道上，動員了各式各樣的交通工具。遊客更似山陰道上，有背着朝山進香袋的老太太，有盛裝艷服去踏靑的少年男女，有制服熨貼的美軍官佐，有大吹大擂的童軍隊伍……寺院的貼鄰，多的是設備簡陋的吃食店，可是沒有一家不嘉賓滿座，寺院內外，更多的是香燭和零星的吃食攤，過客都願意買一串小豆腐乾，放在嘴裏嚼呀嚼的，望望田野的靑翠，似乎可以一洗都市裏的腥俗氣！</p>
<p>寺院裏各處的游客，像是支汛濫的洪流，不住的熙來攘往。燭台上一批紅燭剛被收去，另一批又點着揷上去。高擱在寺廟兩角的宏鐘巨鼓，善男信女都免不了要化一百元的代價，爬上台去，撞擊或鞭打三下，據說可以消災納福。羅漢堂裏的一百〇八尊羅漢，有一部份顯得黑黝黝的，據說缺乏裝金費，每尊要二萬五千元，不少善男信女，把張張法幣，塞在羅漢的手裏。聞名的桃國，雖經整修一新，可是桃樹稀得可憐，掩飾不了刧後的創痕。園裏植着一塊國民革命軍卅二軍陣亡官兵紀念砰，此外還有紀念該軍的碑文和官兵名單石碑各一塊，給遊客以有意義的警惕和啓示！</p>
<p>都監釋世賓，已是五十三歲的人。雲南昆明人，來寺任職，不過三年。他有一個瘦長的身材，臉色顯得很黝黑，操着生硬的雲南口音，絮絮地向記者談龍華寺的歷史。他說：這寺創始於漢末三國東吳赤烏五年，是吳帝孫權所建……他又引出他主持寺院的一番計劃來，說是要根據「宏法利生」四個字去做。還有，他要開設工藝班，使每個師弟，除了念經禮佛之外，還能生產。他預計不出五年，可以不再依靠募借來籌措寺院的經費…</p>
<p>臨別寺院，少不了要登塔一遊。塔門口人像潮湧，好容易擠進了登塔的行列，拾級而上，憑了欄杆，極目遠眺；滾浪浦江，保衛着靑翠的麥隴，那望不斷的菜圓，迎風搖曳着一片燦爛的金黃！殘垣頽瓦上，都隱的地浮現着鱗鱗紅瓦………這一片光輝絢麗的景色，正象徵了龍華古寺的新生，和上海，祖國，興建的前程！（蒼龍）</p>

<h3>淸寒失業者呼籲　請各界捐助赴台旅費</h3>
<p>國內如有相當職業亦所樂就</p>
<p>編者先生—恕我不用客套吧，請允許我借貴報的一角，向社會各界作一次迫切的呼籲！我現在是一個貧窮的失學而失業的人，在淪陷時期的偽方時代中生長，並在某處中學肆業二年，在生活鞭策的威脅下，終於使我失學，在這八年歲月中，我爲了不甘附逆，不甘昧盡天良，我走上了流亡的道路，顚沛流離，忍受一切，甚至於流過血！見過最殘忍的悲劇！可是這生活，竟壓得我喘不出一口氣來，我幾乎臨到死亡的邊緣上了，我雖警覺到照這樣的失業下去，會將我的前途埋沒，會把我的靑春斷送，唉，有誰體會與同情我呢，思前想後，處處都是觸人傷痛的資料，可是我還有年高的祖母和辛勞不辭的父親，他們養我育我為什麼呢。我在萬分痛苦和失望之下，向社會上的各界熱心人士求援助，請救救我這垂死的靑年呀！我懇求的事實是這樣的，從那最近的時期內，台灣的同學寫信給我，叫我去工作，我也極願意到重歸祖國的合灣去開發和培植，現在所使我失望的，從上海到合灣，需要鉅大的川資，我家庭根本負担不起，我奔波了幾天，無從借貸，把所有的物件變賣了，也是無濟無事，我在這種種情形之下，感到深深的失望，痛苦地流淚，素稔先生熱腸古道，祈代為極力給我適當援助吧，切望熱心人士，能少分微力，慨予援助，我永當啣結以報，要求如左：（一）誰能借我法幣若干，可以貿到一張往台的船票，定期奉還，並面簽借據，（二）懇求貴報代爲探聽，一切往台所需手續，幾天可有輪開出？（三）如有熱心人士，垂念救援，一霄爲介，在國內任何地方，代謀棲枝，不計待遇，惟力是視。謹祝撰祺讀者懷鵬飛上（通訊處：嘉善西塘南棚下水溝弄北首二號）</p>
<h3>答覆讀者</h3>
<p>嚴三樂問　鄙人爲廿八歲之男性，近二三年額部上方兩角之髮，漸漸稀少，光秃之皮膚區域，逐漸擴大，最近更發現耳朶上的寸許關度一帶之頭髮，亦似有似無，頗覺有損外觀。茲擬請向（一）此種現象如先天遺傳性，抑後天性，如好思慮，常帶帽子等原因？是否病態？（二）有無恢復原狀或阻止再增劇之辦法？</p>
<p>醫學博士唐仁縉答　禿髮之原因頗多，範圍大者難治，小者可試用水楊酸製劑，此外可試服補血劑及紫外綫照射。</p>
<p>楊葆潤問　每次看到貴欄服務社會的崇高的熟忱時，我本能地發出無限的敬仰。我是一個印刷所中排字房的學徒，每天我得貫注目力在一個個的鉛字上，但是在去年三，四月間，當我的目光接觸到天空或是白色的紙張，牆壁等時，在我右眼的視綫中，發現有一個米粒大小的黑點蕩漾着；眼球轉動時，此黑點亦隨之浮沉不定。當時我並不關心，這樣地過了二，三個月後，此黑點竟漸長成至一英寸左右長之黑綫，略細於火柴梗，敬請指示：此黑綫是否爲眼球受砂眼之摩擦所致？應如何治療方可痊愈？　醫學博士唐仁縉答此病爲玻璃體溷濁，可因高度近視眼眼色紫層，視綱膜，脈絡膜及睫狀體等病而發，不致失明，可用碘劑治療</p>
<h3>陳納德擬具計劃　返美召飛虎舊部　搶運救濟物資　組空運隊來華展開工作</h3>
<p>陳納德將軍昨對記者稱：彼將於最近戴集飛虎隊舊人，組織一航空運輸隊，爲聯合國善後救濟總署，運輸救濟品，分赴各災區。中國交通器具缺乏，爲使救濟物資加速運到災區，不致在路上受阻，或損壞起見，航空運輸，實最奏效之辦法。陳納德將軍將於週內返美一行，召集各舊飛虎隊員，及有志參加該航空遝輸之空軍，使彼等於短促期間內，自美來華服務。同時，一部在華之美空軍，亦將於復員後服務於陳氏麾下。該項組織將以少量之人數，祖任繁忙之運輸工作。該空運隊全部工作人員，暫定三百五十名，在漢口·上海·湖南·河南·廣東·各地區，設空運基地，儘速搶運救濟品至災情最重之地區。陳氏之總運輸基地，則設漢口，將來各物資將由漢口分遝到各災區。提及飛機之問題，陳將軍以爲至易解決，該航空運輸隊之飛機，可向菲列濱美國國外物資淸理委會，購買巨型運輸機。蓋目下在中國之美軍運輸機，均難於合用也·最後陳氏稱：彼此次回美，將各事辦妥，立即起程來華，展開工作。又悉，陳氏與聯總已有祥細計劃，一二日內由聯總公佈。</p>

<h3>上週物價已見穩定　投機中證券　統丙跳出四千大關　新港票與老票軋攏</h3>
<p>上週物價漸趨平穩，各工廠已次第復工，生產量增加，市上貨物存底日見豐厚，金融方面，金鈔穩定，投機活動集中於公債及股票，高峯迭出，雖影響較微，但非市塲之正常狀態，而於工商復負之前途，關係允巨，故各方成望常局早定處理方法云，茲分誌概略如下。</p>
<p>烚赤　上週烚赤發高在一五五萬最低在一三八萬，中途起伏臟定乃因銀樓實銷尙佳，抵補不乏，再則套賣及奪利者頗多，故市勢形成驟升驟降局面，全週趨勢尚稱平穩，週一開價為一五一萬，至週六收價為一四八萬，較前週末軋小二萬五千元。</p>
<p>外幣　中行對美匯率二〇二〇元迄未變動，美鈔趨勢平靜，惟錢兌藥門市會員做開較多，上週在一九〇〇內外徘徊，最高至一九六〇，最低一八六〇元，週末最後價一九〇五元，每日上落約三五十元，較上週軋小廿五元，港幣週一盤疲，至週三因西報載港政府發表新老貨無分彼此，一律通用，人心堅俏，買氣旺盛，且多吐老吸新，新貨由二百餘元飛升至三四〇元，老貨反跌，週四至週六老貨起伏帶軟，新貨步堅，結果新老貨已幾於軋平。</p>
<p>公債　週一·二受華外股步跌之影響，暗市續趨萎疲，統丙曾低至二四二〇元，甲乙丁戊各股亦各小一百五十元，週三四五因暗市吸胃轉濃，及受新港票照老票通用之刺激，人心向榮，各公債均吿上升，統丙由二九五〇元升至四〇〇〇元，週末因同業進提不遺餘力，重趨高翔，統丙高至四五五〇元，統戊成交頗旺，升至二六五〇元，較甲乙二種高出四〇〇元。</p>
<p>股票　週初華股居高思危，紛吿斬結，市價陷入疲途，外股同入下游，次日華洋股票套賣甚多，市價節節退落，週三華股由於游資捲土重來，市價轉入上游，外股開盤頗爲俏俐，嗣以吐售頻乘，乃吿不皮，午刻稍形回漲，週四華洋股因游資活動，均吿上漲，週五華股初極振奮，後以浮多吐售而吿不支，外股挺後下挫，市勢與華股如出一轍，週末華股初尙堅定，後晋入盤旋狀態，結果多見軋低，外股同吿挫落。</p>
<p>米糧　週初食米去化突增，回俏五百元，麵粉外銷濡滯，跌三四百元，糖因敵產處理局續行拋售，市况不振，翌日食糧市况互有上落，糯米跌勢最厲，一號兵船及砲車麵粉同進九千關，黃豆亦帶下數百元，惟生仁另樹一幟，上揚一二千元，週三食米由疲轉定，麵粉跌風稍戢，食油買戶驟增，便做高三千元，週四食糧食油轉入下游，糖因市貨充斥，同業裏足，市况愈下，週五至週末食糧因假期停市。</p>
<p>現紗　在上週間，初承前週末漲風，多頭拉提甚力，且粤漢等主要客帮採辦甚殷，致細紗漲勢甚熾，會創新高價，旋以黃金與股票無甚發展，客帮實需市形退化，多頭逢高吐售，空頭乘勢壓迫，週末頗有急轉直下之勢，全週以星期三之六上支日光雙股細紗三百〇一萬為最高，星期六之十支嘉禾五十三萬為最低，目前紗市已呈細紗虛慌而組紗穩定之局面，大致係現下花價廉宜，廠家買花紡紗，獲利頗豐，尤以細紗獲利最鉅，是以紡建公同接收日商紗廠，積極生產，開售應市，滬埠存底有增無减，且旺銷已逝，客帮如乏大量銷路，前途市勢有呈易跌難漲之槪云。</p>
<p>布市　初亦穩定，嗣以客帮與門莊觀望日多，市上存底充斥，廠家開售者多，執有現貨之多頭，亦有貶價脫售態度，週六大明府綢竟降六萬八千元，比前週六跌六千元，士林布各跌三四千元，十二磅龍頭細布及十六磅粗布等，趨勢似較和緩，已呈平庸之局，花市因棉紗棉布乏力，價亦帶小二三千元。</p>
<h3>聯總準備美金一萬萬　購物資救濟中國　包括般舶食糧及藥品</h3>
<p>（路透社紐的七日電）美國國外淸算委員會太平洋區主任霍華德宣佈，聯合國善後救濟總署準備以美金一萬萬元購買美海陸軍之剩餘船隻，藥品及糧食，以供救濟中國之用，渠稱：處置此項剩餘物資之結果，至少能使美國放棄根據地三處，在上述一萬萬元中，四千萬元將用以購買船隻及港口設備，五萬噸職時配給麥粉，荳類與其他幹糧，藥品亦在其內，聯總業已使用三千萬元購買國外淸算委員會之財物供中國使用，美國推行上述辦法之結果，每一元成本可收回三角七分。</p>
<h3>越米不易出口</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎日電〕越南來訊稱。一月底西貢—堤岸區之存米約五萬九千噸，此外在日本三井　洋行之棧房中發現食米三萬九千噸，此項存米已預定供英軍使用，越南內地存米，估計在十八萬五千噸左右，但截止目前，盟國方面尙無法予以統制，在另一方面，西貢—堤岸區之消費，每月約八千五百噸，此外一月份內曾有食米一萬三千噸運往東京區，以救當地饑饉，二月份中又有一萬五千噸運往，因此今年年內越南已無剩餘食米可以出口矣。</p>
<h3>馬口鐵轉軟</h3>
<p>馬口鐵貨價前因實銷驟增，一度頗見堅挺，然自上月底以來，又呈不景氣之象，買價逐漸軟化，此固由於需要銳减，實銷呆滯之故，而外間所傳海外到貨之說亦非無因，然揆之實際，香港所帶裝來者，不過數十箱雙連而已，可是人心看小，確是實情，各種貨色中，以雙計馬口鐵回風較熾，頃香港來貨，每箱僅售二十三萬元光景，二百磅會司鐵，下跌亦烈，每箱喊二十上萬餘，惟一百十下磅火油箱坯子，因實銷較暢，故行情仍少變化</p>

<h3>東華一比二受挫　靑白榮獲甲組冠軍　逸園球迷二萬盛況空前</h3>
<p>足球聯賽甲組錦標決戰，昨日上午靑白於空前盛況中以二比一擊敗東華，榮獲冠軍，下半時未開紀錄。比賽緊張而精彩，逸園觀衆當在二萬人以上，預定之門票一萬六千張，未及九時，已一掃而光。致後來球迷羣相責難，市體育館職員楊警頑，竟爲無理者所毆傷，售票處受購不到票者之衝入，順手牽羊之徒，竟刧去所得票欽卅萬元以上，爲球賽從來未有之事。</p>
<p>昨錢市長吳主委等均蒞場觀戰，場內秩序，最初維持甚佳，及至比賽前五分鐘時，因爲一部份球隊之管理等須入塲，乃觀衆乘機將新築而並不堅固之籬笆，一擁而倒，一窩蜂進入塲內，沿珠場白綫圍住，比賽雖能在順利中維持到底，總不免爲大戰遜色。</p>
<p>靑白攻守俱佳</p>
<p>昨日兩隊可謂勢均力敵，靑白攻守俱佳守則孟義良嚴士鑫使阿戴龍海幼良，活動困難，聯絡中斷，前鋒曹秋事李義臣之活躍，致使上半時得能操縱攻勢，東華以一球失敗，在相等之局面，所謂有幸不幸也。</p>
<p>半場二與一比</p>
<p>比賽因觀衆衝入場內，致遲至十時〇十分開始，裁判與守衝，東華先聲奪人，上塲未及三分鐘即由李壵獲獲中，但靑白越戰越勇，由李義臣顧以撒，先後命中，上半時二對一後來居上，下半時各無所獲。開賽之初，東華撥球前進，孫錦順得球，頭上擺渡，傳與李垚，李遙遙吊門，祗見球自上而下，直落靑白門內，秦必高雖躍起迎接，僅碰得手指，球竟進綱矣。東華上場見利，獲此意外一球，士氣倍見旺盛，是時靑白主守，嚴士鑫獨力抵　，表演盡善盡美。至廿五分鐘時，靑白反攻，費春華得球勾中，張邦綸形成空鬥，李義臣乘機剷進，逼成一對一平手，自此靑白越戰越盛，前鋒因頻得後方之來球，故機會漸多，四十分鐘時費春華開角球，曹秋亭反身一勾，落點極好，願以撤球落人到，一撥而入，靑白後來居上，以二對一反勝，無何，上半時告終，靑白二對一勝。</p>
<p>東華反攻無效</p>
<p>休息之後，東華幼良能海易位，莊友仁入替，張林根移前，東華志在收復，初頗見聲勢洶洶，五分鐘時戴麟經在十碼處倒勾一球，惜太輕爲秦必高捉住，十五分鐘孫錦順在二十碼後處放冷箭，秦接而復失，戴麟經衝上遲一步，仍爲秦所救出。東華屢攻不入，難免氣餒，靑白吾遝旣過，又見活躍，許文奎因足部抽筋，羅　福入替，生力軍上塲，亦見賣力，故此時東華欲攻不入，陷於苦守。直至最後五分鐘，孟義良撞人犯規，罰任意球，在二十碼以內孫錦順主罰，打來妙極，一秦必高躍起托出，得免大難，東一華不獲此球，遂無法挽救，草草終塲。</p>

<h3>如何疏導游資</h3>
<p>— 須維周</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，淪陷區各地殷富之資金，集中於認爲較爲安全與商業最爲繁盛之上海，以從事於最有把握之囤貨，或搜購黃金，此項鉅額游資，旣無確定日期，又無一定方向，深爲世人所詬病，蓋以趨向黃金，則黃金狂跳，趨向物資，則物資在漲，以致民不聊生，造成種種不安現象，自中央銀行外匯與黃金公開供給，物資以到貨漸湧，此可怖之游資，遂趨向股票之一途，數星期來，股票價格飛黃騰達，不可遏止，設非善爲引導，其爲害於正當之工商事業，深爲可慮。</p>
<p>勝利之後，淪陷區游資，初受二百作一之影響，其波動之力量頗見减弱，自自由區鉅額款項，絡續匯來：又以敵偽時期，組織之銀行·錢莊·信托·保險·以及各種企業公司，表面上雖已停業，實際上仍在積極活動者，不少槪見。加以正在預備進行之工商企業，鑒於勞資糾紛之層出不窮，薪工之劇烈增加，使費方無利可圖，不得不改弦易轍，暫時觀望，於是游資之數量，較之敵僞時期，有過之而無不及，一旦流入股票市塲，股票之價格，遂飛黃騰達，高峯迭出，雖一部份之股票，可能乘高拋售，以另置最新式的機器與設備，以增高他日之出品，然須知股票脫手之後，其管理權並未喪失，此等管理人是否完全穩實可靠，投資人要不可不加以切實注意，淸末之橡皮股票之往事，歷歷在目，非故作危言，確認聳聽也，今之投資於股票者，未必無此戒心，祇以普遍的重物輕幣心理，皆食圖目前之獲利，而於其股票本身之實際估値如何，往往不暇顧及，故筆者以爲證券交易所，亟須復業，不宜再緩，蓋必如是，而後上市股票之資產，可以審査，其生產，銷數狀况，及董監事應行保有之股票，是否依法封存，有所稽考也。</p>
<p>竊以為證券交易所復業之後，似可擴大其業務範圍，利用普遍的重物輕幣，與信賴外匯，輕視法幣之心理，將國外開拍之英磅與美金各公債，同時在上海開拍，以裕籌碼，一面則增加公債流通數量，並鼓勵地產之活動，如减輕地產捐稅，土地執業證之過戶手續道契化，使土地買賣或抵押之便利，一如股票債券，則國庫與市庫之收入，旣可增加，而游資之去路，亦可增廣，此或亦調劑金融，安定市面之一首歟。</p>
<h3>孟買金銀市場　投機活動甚銳</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕據「經濟學家」雜誌稱：印度政府取締孟買金銀市塲投機活動，尙未獲有顯著成效，據財部某職員稱，提高金銀進口稅之目的在挫折投機活動，但結果適得其反，因新稅不足以平衡孟買與國際市塲價格之差額，反而使其差額更加顯著，孟買金價每盎司九十九盧比，的等於每盎司三百九十四先令，較倫敦價格，超過倫敦價格百分之一百二十九，按印度政府規定黃金進口稅每托拉二十五盧比（等於一八〇喱純金），同時增加白銀進口稅每盎司八安那。</p>

<h3>被難十七校的呼籲　希望在署假前有個解決辦法</h3>
<p>— 本報記者：穆人</p>
<p>抗戰勝利了，一切都在醞釀着復員。然面而試觀半年來的復員成績。似乎沒有多大成就可以報告，尤其是敎育復員。</p>
<p>敎育為立國之本，當此戰後百廢待興，尤應多多培植建國人才。可是看到全國各地普遍的有着失學靑年，鬧着學校恐慌，眞使我們對政府所說怎樣視敎育的詳言感到懷疑了。</p>
<p>昨天下午，在上海市被難私立學校聯合會招待新聞記者席上，主席孫翔仲代表愛國女校，崇德女中·新華藝師·東南女體師·明德女中·淸心女中·廣東女中·澄衷中學·麥倫中學·念華女中·淸心中學·俊修女校·博仁中學·育育中學·新民中學·及大夏大學·持志學院等十七校，向政府當局及社會人士伸長脖子，提高嗓子，在大聲疾呼。</p>
<p>孫主席說：「我們各校，在這次戰爭中，或全部被毀，或部份被摧殘，校具散失，損失不貲，當此戰後復興期間，恢復不易。如幸有全部或一部保存的，亦大都爲軍隊佔據。我們雖曾一次次的聯名向行政院·敎育部·宣慰使·參政會·上海市敎育局·敵偽產業處理局等機關呼籲，請求撥發敵產房屋及修理要每校一萬萬元，但直到現在一無成效，不是說一向主管機關呈請核　　，便道「須由中央或地方政府統籌辦理」。彼此推設，負責無人，勝利到如今已半年了，一學期又快過去，我們這許多學校，或全今還在停辦中，或因陋就簡的掙扎着。我們自覺再也不能這樣延宕下去了。四月六日又特快郵代電　蔣主席，請求准予令知上海市政府撥給敵產房屋及修理費。」</p>
<p>「為國家敎育計，為民族前途計，我們希望政府當局能予以協助，在署假前能夠有一個解決的辦法。」孫主席就這樣激昻的結束了談話。</p>
<p>市敎育局李副局長熙謀，在一片掌聲中站起來致詞，他歷述了敎育局處境的困難，勝利後所接收的敵僞學校，敎育局不能充份</p>
<p>發揮它的權力，像接收僞校，祗接收到了一批學生，所以前幾天曾在市臨時參議會上，提出了希望一切軍隊讓出所駐學校的提案</p>
<p>李副局長又說：最近第三方面軍與日僑管理處有意將敵偽房產移交市府支配。錢市長曾口頭應允過，假如市府一旦有權支配這些房屋，一定先撥給學校，然後再輪到政府派作辦公用及市府職員宿舍。</p>
<p>一方面李副局長又建議各被難學校，開具損失淸單，彙呈政府，以備將來向日本淸算追償這筆舊賬。　「敎育局很關懷這件事情，一定盡力帮助，但力量薄弱，希望大家能諒這番苦心。」最後李副局長這樣說。</p>
<p>走出會場，想起了許多無校安插的學生：「敎育第一！敎育眞的第一嗎？」</p>

<h3>糧倉無米！公路無樹！　湘災民死亡枕藉</h3>
<p>— 三月廿五日長沙通訊　本報特派員高元禮</p>
<p>湖南災情的嚴重，近來頗受各方重視，據在湘省災區視察者談：廿年的陝災，和卅年的豫災，似乎還沒有現在的湘災厲靑。近年來社會公認為中國糧倉的湖南，竟致弄到沒飯吃，事態之嚴重，可以想見一斑。</p>
<p>記者週來與各方接觸，綜合他們的意見，都一致認為（一）由於勝利前的寇災，（二）由於勝利後的糊塗災，湘南已陷於無災，無處不荒的困境。</p>
<p>人力·耕牛　遭空前大損失</p>
<p>勝利前的寇災，受影響的當然不止湖南一省，然而在武漢會戰後，湖南就變成國門。七年來，幾進幾出的會戰，幾乎每次都在秋收以後，這使得農村得不到一點喘息機會，由損失而袞落，由衰落以致破產。根據善後救濟總署湖南分署的統計數字，僅耕牛一項，全省損失即達六十四萬二千七百八十八頭之多。而人力損失，連死亡傷病及受害在內，共二百廿五萬人。其中貧苦農民，多係死於差役及疾病，的佔一百五十萬人。農村惟一的財富人力，旣損失一百五十萬之多，而耕牛損失又如此龐大，即任何富裕的糧倉，亦非减少生產不可。何况湖南之爲餘糧產區，不過虛名，實則農民每以雜糧替換正糧，以圖外銷，爲農村金融之主要源給。目前雜糧旣感不足，自不能不賴正糧以爲生活，於是此紙糊燈能，遂一戳即破，災象立見。</p>
<p>農具·種籽　悉遭破壞無剩</p>
<p>農村的人力和耕牛，已遭如此重大的損失，而其他農具，種籽和房屋，亦於敵人佔領期內，作戰期內，破壞無遺。於是佃農退佃逃荒的現象，遂風起雲湧。湘鄕縣立中學校產佃農，向學校方面提出兩項要求：（一）退佃，（二）如須繼續耕種，則請貸給耕牛，種籽和資本，否則只有聽其荒蕪。湘鄕的普遍情形都如是。其他各縣亦大略相同。衡山縣鐵道兩側的農民，都離開了土地，到大堡霞流等車站湖南分署所設的粥廠來就食。鄕村裏偶爾也還看見一兩處以人拖犁頭來耕種的，那還是好些的人家。在祁陽零陵更普遍的荒凉，人們已經不分你的我的，大家在求生的前提下，能多活一天算天，於是種種的不法和騷亂，繼續不斷的發生。零陵縣長齊修德的報吿說：餓死的達二百四十八人，都是經保甲長具結證明，有姓名可査的。湖南分署余籍傳署長，親去視察一趙，帶回了人民所食的八種草根樹皮，聞這些都已寄到紐紐聯總去他樣本。</p>
<p>湘北湘中各縣，如：平江，瀏陽，岳陽，和湘陰，以及濱湖的南華，安等縣，亦同樣嚴重。濱湖的堤垸，被敵人破壞的也不少，許多湖田都浸在水裘，無法耕種，農民冬季不但無棉被，即迎棉衣都沒有一件，因爲大量船隻被燬，交通極不方便，商品的流通很成問題。</p>
<p>「糊塗災」　平添一半災情</p>
<p>勝利後的糊塗災，至少增加了一半災情。以湘陰爲例：大軍北上，爲了運輸便利，拆了許多房屋來造橋，迎樓橡和柱子都拆去了。還有把墳墓掘開，取那未朽的棺材來架橋的。通過湖南的軍隊，確實不少，雖然爲時甚暫，但多少對多災多難的農村有些騷擾，要鷄要鴨，買穀買糧，固然有些是軍隊自己吃，有些也轉賣出去，成爲民糧民食，以圖漁利。第三方面軍到京滬半載，可是今天在攸縣，還有第三方面軍的人員在徵用船隻，致那裏生產的烟煤，無法運出，長沙的煤價，陡漲一倍。</p>
<p>急賑·工賑　解決不了問題</p>
<p>善後救濟總署湖南分署，成立已半年多，工作精神殊値贊佩。但受了交通的限制，物資方面僅分配到舊衣一千袋，舊鞋三百袋，（舊鞋裏面有許多高跟皮鞋？農村裏似乎用不着。）麵粉一百幾十噸，有一部麵粉在由漢運長途中潮損。關於麵粉運湘的數字，雖有七百餘噸，事實上運到的不多，且幾乎全部配發在衡陽祁陽零陵，作爲急賑工賑之用。</p>
<p>分署對急賑確盡了最大的努力，據分署工作人員談：在一二兩月份，幾乎是以全力來辦理湘南急賑，零陵的粥廠，由一所增至四所，收容人數由五百增至一千人，而工賑方面，預計的零道公路，零東公路，邵新公路，相繼動工，但連日天雨，進工頗受影響。</p>
<p>空頭人情　農民無意接受</p>
<p>急賑和工賑，仍然解決不了問題，人民需要的是固有的田園，然而固有田園的恢復，不外耕牛，農具，種籽，肥料，資金，以及勞力的獲得，因此，農貸是目前最迫切需要的。可是事實上的農貸，全然不適於老百姓的要求，中農與救濟分署合辦的第一期農貸，僅一億二千萬元，分配給災情慘重的長沙·衡陽·祁陽·岳陽·臨湘·湘潭·衡山·常寗·湘鄕等二十五縣市，每縣原定最高額八百萬元，旋以爭貸過甚，變爲至少八百萬元。但這數字，確實算做杯水車薪，無濟於事。每縣總數雖爲八百萬元，而事實上分配到每一請貸農戶身上，究竟又有幾文？假定每縣請求貸放者爲一千戶，每戶只能貸到八千元。這區區之數，購牛又相差太遠，（湘省牛價每頭至少廿萬元。）購種籽又無農具，購農具又無肥料，眞令人啼笑皆非！聞衡陽之八百萬元，迄今僅貸出一百餘萬，因農民不願接受此空頭人情也。</p>
<p>善後救濟分署對於農村救濟，曾擬有救濟湘省戰後農業實施計劃一種，呈奉總署核示：（一）關於擬先購耕牛十萬頭一節，總署認爲如此巨大數目，事實上無法購買，且所需價款甚鉅，目前尙無從撥發，俟將來聯總如有耕牛運到時，再在湘省配售。（二）關於擬製農具犁·耙·鋤四十萬具一節，總署以爲如此數量，恐當地鐵匠無法供應，將來聯署有一部小型農具供應，所請應從緩議。分署所擬數字，固然龐大，但確係目前湘南急切需要的，但辦則確無如此鉅款，不辦又無法救濟，被災的人民祗有聽天由命了。</p>
<p>赤痢·虐疾　奪老百姓性命</p>
<p>隨着饑餓而來的疾病，正以巨大的壓力施於飢民，各地的人民，山於營養不良，和凍餒的關係，普遍的傳染着赤痢和瘧疾。零陵縣長齊德修的正式報吿上說：因患赤痢和瘧疾，缺乏醫藥而致死的，已達一萬餘人，以縣屬的芝城鎭及精忠·全忠·公平·慶平等鄉死亡的人數爲最多，病者三倍。湘鄕縣的病患者，正與日俱增，在湘鄉鄕村裏藥材缺乏，（指中藥而言。）郞中先生所開的藥方，在藥舖裏買不完全，鄕民又無力入城診治，因此祇有躺在床上，聽其自然發展。衡陽參議會所編的寇呈疫召災報吿書，公布衡陽人民死於疫者，每日以千計。最近三個月死於疫者，達九萬餘，病多的庫疾與赤痢。</p>
<p>免征軍糧　列為首要項目</p>
<p>請賑的代表團紛紛來長沙請願，招待各界報吿災情的請柬，到處都有，而請者自請，辦者自辦，於事完全無補。請賑代表團，幾乎是全省七十八縣市都有。</p>
<p>在呼籲救災的高潮中，自然，請免征購軍糧，是列爲第一項。湘陰代表仇碩夫先生在招待新聞界席上沉痛的說：「湘陰沿公路鐵路河流各地，已經看不見一顆樹了。都給砍光了。戰事結束時，湘陰有五個縣政府，都是要老百姓供給，請諸位想：湘陰苦到什麼程度？淪陷時，敵人搶奪去殼十萬石，老百姓還有多少糧食剩餘？現在，政府却要湘陰人征購十六萬五千石軍糧，老百姓爲了守法，想了兩個辦法：（一）請政府派員搜査民戶，有糧即封。（二）由老百姓出錢，交政府派員到民間去自由照時價採購。除了限價，不够的錢，老百姓都願拿出來。其實，軍隊早就挨家挨戶搜索了，硬長沒有糧食。」另一位代表說：「湘陰不但沒有糧出賣。而且老百姓已經在喫草了。農貸分文也沒有到人民手裏。我們進省來喊寃，請求救濟機關從速救濟。」</p>
<p>雖然各縣的代表們，對軍糧的問題說了這樣沉痛的話，但負責採購軍糧的當事人，湖南省田糧管理處副處長在招待新聞記者席上正式宣布。目前已購數量及供應困窘情形，他說：「各縣配購軍糧，據表報統計，僅收七萬餘石，按市價自由採購部份，亦僅十餘萬石，（按配購總數爲一百六十萬石。）現糧款拮据，無法再按市價自由採購，而各縣配購之糧仍多，籲請免購，推動異常困難，致衡陽長沙岳陽各地駐軍，已將斷炊，日俘則已改食稀飯或乞食度日。情勢嚴重，殊難爲繼。」據聞某軍事高級負責人在省府參加討論配購軍糧問題時，曾說過：「軍糧購不到，軍隊無寫，　　到民　軍民，那我可不能負責。」</p>
<p>災象環生　悠悠歲月怎樣</p>
<p>一方面是非辦不可，一方面是非取銷不可。現在還沒有解決辦法。有人提議：照四川向大戶征購辦法辦理。因爲湖南的大地主確實不少，每年收穀三五萬石的大有人在，讓他們多拿點出來，也許可以救救目前的急難。但這辦法政府因碍於某種特殊關係，尙未正式提出。</p>
<p>由以上所述的種種情形，來推測將來的發展，眞値得令人憂慮，現在的災象，簡直可以說是才在萌芽，亦可以說是大悲劇的預吿，春耕在即，農民奄無準備，即使可以春耕，而秋收尙有數月，這悠長的歲月，如何度過，眞令人爲之杞憂！</p>
<h3>衣食住恐慌　包圍整個日本</h3>
<p>— 三月廿一日東京通訊　錦標雷雲合寄</p>
<p>「民以食爲天」，日本國內的最大痛苦爲食糧不足，戰爭時是如此，投降後更是如此。近年來，肥料缺乏，人工减少，造成農業上的二大煩惱，去年稻作，所爲十四年來僅有之歉收，今後隨着在外軍人及僑民的遣送回日將更形匱乏，天災人禍，民不堪命。去年有歐洲某觀察家及日本某農林大臣同時發表豫言，謂如今年無外國食糧輸入，則日本將有一千萬國民由饑餓而陷於營養不良，再發生疾病而死亡。</p>
<p>日本自一九四一年與美國開始戰爭後，便覺悟到此後物資的恐慌，而開始對食糧加以澈底的統制。於是，飯館裏也買不到飯，菜蔬油醬也收買配給了。農民種了田，一律須按照收穫量及公定價格供出給政府，政府以能維持人體生命之最低食物量配給人民，本來一壯年男子每日可領購配給食米日升二合一勺，計三百三十公分，（老人小孩和女子還要比例遞减）此食米內須摻入二成雜糧。最初，東京市民，尙可每四日配給一次魚鮮，後來戰局日趨緊張，資源日見窮困，去秋再臨時减配一成，日食僅爲二百九十七公分，而其中所摻和之雜糧，戰爭結束後由三成而增摻至七成，凡大豆，蕎麥，玉蜀黍，高粱，稗，豆餅等，不下十二種，旣燒不爛，又嚼不碎，直着喉嚨硬嚥。至於副食品之配給，如蔬菜，魚恰，油醬之類。</p>

<p>就東京一地而言，一月平均須一百五十萬之婦女，費三小時去列隊憑券購買，但日本國民之蔬菜必要量，每人每日約須二百五十公分。一九四三年九月，東京市民平均每人每日的配給蔬菜二百四十八公分，一九四四年九月，平均爲九十二公分，一九四五年九月，平均爲二十五公分。其後，副食品之配給竟至於絕無。六人之家庭，三日間僅配給葱二根，某著名專門學校敎授竟因營養失調而死，後來診斷係葉錄素太少維他命B缺乏之故，纔引起一片非難之聲，政府無法，連茶葉的生產及配給都不能維持，乃勸人民採桑葉代茶，而更命令東京市民每日採五公分之柿樹葉泡湯吃，以補蔬菜茶葉中維他命之不足。</p>
<p>關於食物在人體內所發生的熱量，普通以「卡路里」計之。大槪我人即使臥着不動，每日也要一千三百「卡路里」的消耗，方能維持生命，此熱量相常於三百七十公分食米，如稍做些日常行動工作，即須二千二百「卡路里」，前世界恐慌常時，在蘭印調査之結果，人類生存上每日一千八百「卡路里」之熱量爲最低必要；現在日本國民之食物攝取量，平均爲每日一千五百「卡路里」。據日本政府於戰爭結束後調査，其人口爲七千二百萬（其中女子較男人多四百萬），但其稻作之常年收穫量平均爲六千五百萬石，是以常感不足。去年兩次大颶風大水害，鐵橋衝毁，爲國有鐵道創辦以來之最大損害，故秋收由四千六百萬石之豫想收獲量再减而爲四千二百萬石，農民之「供出」收買量，由三千萬石减至二千六百萬石，並許以其他麥粉，桑葉，藷蔓等代替。可是，現在農民對政府懷疑，都抱着觀望態度，遲遲不肯「供出」，所以，現在尙不是够吃不够吃的問題，是農民肯拿出來不肯拿出來的問題，因爲即使歉收，照現在量的配給，尙可吃到今夏，實際只差六·七·八三個月的食糧，司是，如今四·五兩月的食糧之「供出」，農民都不肯信仰這政府了。所以去年年底，全國六大都市的食糧保有量，東京爲八日分，京都爲五日分，其他四大都市都只有十二·三日分而已。</p>
<p>大衆提倡「粉食化」　蒲公英野草當飯吃</p>
<p>日本投降後，盟國已准許其輸入一部份食糧，可是，杯水車薪，無濟於事。於是，肥料改作飼料，飼料充爲食料，即如養蠶製絲後所遺槳之蠶蛹，戰前原作爲肥料之用，但戰時由肥料改爲飼料，再改而爲工業用的油脂原料，再改而爲製造營養藥劑的貴重原料，一般國民不能輕易入手，而營養藥品祇能配給於醫院及軍隊，據說：如照每日二合的配給米生活，人體內所缺乏各項養分，可以吃十顆蠶蛹以補足之，如吃至十三顆即有過剩之感。其主要食物除稻麥·藷·豆等農作物外，近且發見蒲公英等二十種野草可供食用，現正從事採集，晒乾磨粉，摻製麵包，故現正提倡「粉食化」，凡樹皮，桑葉，蘿菔根，甘曙蔓，魚骨，雜草，蝗虫等，一經晒製成粉，即易於嚥嚼食用，故日本自謂此後係「粉食化時代」之到來。</p>
<p>只管放火並不殺人　半身不遂啼笑皆非</p>
<p>日本人自己也說過：「用火來燒木頭，原是容易不過的事，可是日本的房屋，是把木頭鋸得細些，架得空些，加上油漆和紙片，使它燃燒得更容易些。」盟軍看淸楚了他的致命所在，便決定採用了燃燒戰術，每次所擲下的六鎊小型燃燒彈，資本比較不多，火却放得極大，並且，只放火，不殺人，旣狼狽，可憐，却又滑稽有趣。</p>
<p>原來美空軍對日轟炸計劃，分三期進行，第一期爲軍事設施及軍需工廠，第二期爲大中小都市的無差別轟炸。第三期爲交通建設的破壞。其第一期計劃所收的效果，爲日本飛機製造能力的低减，當一九三七年七月開戰當時日本飛機每月出產僅一百架，至一九四五年六月竟漸增至月產三千架，但因美機大事轟炸軍需工廠的結果，至七月間，即驟减爲一千架，地下工廠非一時所克改建，空中戰鬥力遂大爲低减。第二期爲都市轟炸，六大都市除京都外，大多經過數次空襲，一夜有出動「B29」八百架以上者，其後中小都市均未倖免，對全國六十六都市，計投下燃燒彈十萬噸，工業地域被破壞百分之四十二。試舉一例：其在太平洋戰塲中最南之臨海一縣爲鹿兒島，自從轟炸開始至投降時之一百五十日中，被空襲一百六十八次。全縣三市一百三十八村，除其中五村市外，被襲殆遍，由此可見一斑。第三期轟炸剛在開始之初，日本便屈膝投降了，大概太平洋戰爭也須依照德意志前例，炸至境內無一寸鐵道可通時，接濟斷絕，欲戰不能，方作登陸作戰之進攻。是以最初僅炸鐵道橋樑，那時，九州接連下關的海底墜道入口，已被炸至不能修復，其第一綫的運輸早已半身不遂，後來，連市內的電車都炸，以機雷作海上封鎖，擊沉船舶五十萬噸，物資補給殆已陷成絕境了。</p>
<p>全日本被毀的住宅　總數達二百十萬戶</p>
<p>住的方面，由於日本時常發生劇烈的地震，大多數房屋都是木造的。颶風洪水，相繼頻仍，其倒塌衝毀之慘，形成近年來不能安居樂業的最大煩惱。禁不起美空軍採取了燃燒彈戰術，要燒便是一片，一片便是數里，一個都市，只要炸幾次，便什麼都完了。此次，全國住宅被燬者達二百十萬戶，日本投降後，國民由鄉間避難歸家，因木材及運輸都生問題，一時不克修建恢復，因此，現在都集團居住於寺院及學校等處。</p>
<p>房屋早已自動拆除　居住恐慌隨之加重</p>
<p>一九四四年六月十八日下午，記者在東京最熱鬧的日本橋區三越百貨公司門前走下電車，見有一大堆人在搶蒞買號外，上前一看，知道是美機初襲北九州的製鐵廠了。那裏八幡附近的二十里範圍內，滿大是林立的大烟囱，滿天是烟，滿地是小鐵軌，滿地是煤，的確是戰時重鎭。因此，日本國內引起了國民心理上的大衝動，便從此朝夕加緊訓練防空工作，消防，救護，疎散，忙得不亦樂乎。直至一九四四年十一月二十四日，「B29」巨型機悠悠然成羣飛翔在東京市民的頭上，大家纔曉得空襲非人力所可防禦的了，乃紛紛自動把房屋拆倒，疏散到鄕下去，或在被燒的瓦礫堆中掘地洞，把衣被鍋碗銷在裏面，過起壕舍生活來。國民上街，都要穿防空服裝，鋼帽，綁腿布，救護袋，缺一便會受到警察干涉的。同時，日本對於國民的思想管制得極嚴，通信的檢査十分厲害，因此，空襲究竟怎樣可怕，要一且臨到自已身上方纔會明白。每個地方一被炸過，每個郵筒上便立刻貼了預先印好的通吿，警吿國民通信，除了本身的安危外，禁止將被炸詳情通知親友，否則是會遭受到嚴厲處罰的。</p>
<p>即使有了「衣料券」　依然買不到衣服料</p>
<p>日本本來是世界第一紡織國，可是原料都取給於別人，戰爭中印度的原棉及澳洲的羊毛轍人都斷絕了，纖維原料，捉襟露肘，雜纖維及人造絲也因製造藥品的缺乏而發生問題，所賴者只有蠶絲。不過因爲食糧增產的關係，桑樹面積由五十萬町步而减爲二十萬町步，製絲工廠，也因機械移轉於軍需製造用而編入於第四級工業。同時，蠶絲製品須儘先供給落下傘及飛機製造之用，不能全部作爲民需，所以纖維原料固然是統制收買，紡織製品也是綜合製造，而國民衣料用品更無疑的是絕對採取嚴格的配給制度。最近二年中，每壯年男子一人配給「衣料券」五十「點」，凡市上購買纖維製品，除價錢外，尚須付給此項「衣料券」若干點，如綫襪一雙，約須三點，汗衫一襲，約須十點，短衫袴一套，的須四十點。此項「衣料券」，用完後即無法再購買布疋。但不久又變本加厲，有了錢，有了「衣料券」，仍舊買不到衣用品了。家庭須有保甲的「配給票」，工人須有工廠的「配給票」，學生須有學校的「配給票」。後來，商店裏就根本沒有衣用品，修理洋傘之黑色零布的配給，補縫衣袴的棉綫之配給，也都屢次延誤，由失望而趨於絕望了。因此，紙製的代用品，如紙帽，紙馬甲，紙被單等，便應運而生了。</p>
<p>可笑而又可憐的，日本農民種植的稻麥，皆在沒有十分成熟之前便趁早把靑色穗頭收割了。爲了一經成熟，株桿枯黃，恐怕給美機投磷磺製片下來燒掉，還有，因爲油田的缺乏，南洋接濟斷絕，資源極端窮困，便設法把甘藷的澱粉製煉酒精，用作飛機和燃料。是以在食糧窮困之時，尙把稻田掘去改植甘藷，他們對國民呼籲說：「人要吃，飛機也要吃呀！」因此在戰時述山芋也成爲工業用而難得入口，甘諸的品種，經各大學的苦心研究，發明新品種二十餘種，其最優良者所含澱粉達百分之二十四，常時按戶配給種苗，每人均須種植「供出」；而房屋一被空襲燒掉，便勸誘在燒地上種植甘藷，因爲被燒的土地，合鉀質肥料成份，最宜種禇，同時，把投下的許多燃燒彈彈壳，改製農具，種植後即使再遭轟炸，也因甘諸爲地下根作物，沒有損害，等到一經投降，恰値收穫適期，便移軍用爲民食，而把防空壕移作收褸物貯藏之用了。</p>
<p>盟軍沒收軍衣軍米　轉變爲日平民之用</p>
<p>同時，在過去三個月中，美第六軍已從日本陸海軍方面沒收軍用糧食二十萬噸及衣着二十萬件，這些沒收品，均已轉爲日本平民之用。</p>
<p>這些物資之中包括大豆十三萬二千噸，魚及肉四萬二千噸和糧頭蔬菜一億一千三百萬聽，此外，並已散發了大批衣着，計有毛毯四百五十萬條，鞋四百萬雙，短襪四百萬變，外衣六十萬件，制服三百萬套，內衣四百萬套。</p>
<p>根據第八軍第十一軍團昨天宣佈的數字，這份第二次宣佈的淸單內，至少有糧食四萬六千噸，毛毯約三百萬條，上裝及外衣二百萬件，其他衣着三百萬件，鞋一百五十萬雙，以及日民亟需的建築材料及醫藥品若干。</p>
<h3>日俘在京服役</h3>
<p>在南京市工務局主持下之日本徒手官兵服役工程，由日本第四十師國担任，共分五個作業隊，計有一萬二千人。全部工程中最困難之一段，爲秦淮河疏濬工作，因該河年久凝塞水位高度，大雨數日後，幾高出京市和城外地面，河身泥積有三萬立方。岸上垃圾，有二千七百七十方，爲降低水位計，必須排除泥積和垃圾。</p>

<h3>倡針織工業</h3>
<p>— 周克强</p>
<p>針織工業，遠在十三世紀之意大利，即有所記錄，自十五世紀中葉，傳入英國。蓋常時針織器械簡單，出品粗陋，不過用手編織而已。但其織物，爲人生日用所必需，故至十六世紀，即爲世人所注意，致在十六世紀末，英人威廉李（William　Lee）發明了彈性針之手搖襪機，此大成就，即奠定了針織工業的基礎，引起了世人硏究針織的與趣。後又有英人瑪血坦特眞（MatthewTownshend）發明舌針，而舌針對織物編成的動作，更較彈性針簡單，至此，乃促進針織機根本的改革，而使手織範圍，進入機械化，針織工業亦就展現了前途無限的光明。上面說針織物，是人生日用所必需，何以成爲日用所必需？因爲針織物有其特有的性質和用途：針織物之編成，乃由屈曲的紗綫，根據經緯的方向，述綴而成，所以織物一受强力，即張緊而成直綫，外力一去，又復還原。日本人，命名針織機有爲莫大小機器者，因其織物富有伸縮性也。又織物因紗綫連綴成歪小形之曲綫，致組織多孔，所以製成品柔軟鬆適，製造內衣，手套，襪十等，夏能吸汗，冬能保溫，適合體段，予以快感，緊貼肌膚的衣服材料。自從八年抗戰以來，一般人早已衣破襤褸，若靠他國施捨些破衣破褲，恐非治本之策，因爲我國地廣人多，這四萬萬五千萬同胞，如果每人添置衣褲各一件，總數就可驚人。况勝利以後，日本人失去了南洋各地，針織物之市塲，在吾國丢下了很多針織機器，吾人當把握這機會，來發展這千載難逢，對外貿易之良機。不是見到，別人爲了爭奪市塲，而在鈎心鬥角嗎？而吾人坐失此良機，而不謀求進展，也就證明了吾人沒有作爲，及坐待他人侵略之而已。不過話又得講回來：吾人要振興針織工業，不是絕無困難，蓋吾國之針織歷史短暫，技術幼稚，故不能不作最大努力，並請求政府能以國家資本營謀，及培植針織技術人才，更廣應羅人才，使他們安心工作，發揮能力。</p>
<p>筆者曾參觀西藏路南林里的山大織造廠，是敵產，經經濟部接管而復工的，是一所小型工廠，機器尙全，主持者朱訓，王鶴齡及職工近百人，進廠見到處處整潔，醒目之標語，常被導入工塲間時，工人全無談諭嬲笑之聲，祗見她們精神灌注工作，毫不放鬆，因此成品統計表上，工作效率之直線白上。據工人們說每逢週初，召開一次集會，由職負輪流報吿時事新聞，本週應做工作，並講述中國之命運一段，到了週末，由各部舉行小組討論，檢討週內工作的缺點和應改進事項。一切管理，可以稱得是井井有條。所以很値得我們提倡針織工業，希望政府，早日復工接管之各針織工廠，廣羅培植針織人才，注意工人敎育，使針織工業，能佔居吾人建國富國之重要地位。</p>
<h3>航空工業</h3>
<p>— 漢</p>
<p>二十世紀最麽登的工業，可以說是航空工業了；由於航空器的發達，空間的距離就隨着大大的縮短了，以前因時間所受到的損失，現在减少了，以前因地形所感的困難，現在解決了。</p>
<p>航空在此次大戰的勝利史上，鑄下光輝而不可磨滅的一頁，無論是在戰塲上或大後方，它都表現了極佳的成績，在和平到來的今日，它將負起交通運輸，溝通文化，傳播和平的種子，增進人類幸福的責任；就國防來說，就民生來說，它都是一個現代國家所必需具有的條件。</p>
<h3>勝利前後的茶葉業</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>茶葉，向爲我國主要輸出品之一。據茶葉界的統計，抗戰以前的茶葉外銷，每年的在六十萬公擔左右，挽回的漏扈，實在也不在少數。</p>
<p>「八一三」抗戰軍興，茶葉的外銷，受到了嚴重的打擊；尤其自太平洋戰事發生後，茶葉對外的銷路，根本斷絕，一般的製茶廠，也紛紛閉歇，製茶的工人，有的改營小本經紀，有的僕僕風塵，過單帮的生活，有的旣不善經商，又不能走單帮，而致聊倒於飢餓綫上者，亦有之，這實在是茶葉業最不景氣的時期。</p>
<p>勝利以後，各業復員，茶葉爲我國外銷的主要貨品，自然也在積極籌備復業之中。但是，一方面因爲物價飛漲，茶商經濟困難，力能恢復舊業者，亦祗十二三家而已。他方面，更因抗戰期內山農挖茶植糧，致茶葉的產量，祗及戰前十分之二，欲求恢復戰前的生產量，實在不是短時間內所能實現的。</p>
<p>據茶葉界中人語筆者：戰前外銷的茶葉，最著名的爲祁門紅茶，婺源珍眉，平水，大帮珠茶，以及杭州的龍井，獅峯等：製茶的工廠，以上海一埠而論，計有六十餘家左右；每家的僱用工人十餘人，其工人工資除供給膳宿外，每日的大洋七角左右，如今，生活日高，工人的工資，除了供給膳宿之外，至少須在法幣千元左右，然而，以此戔戔之數，欲維持每個工人的家庭生活，實在也是一件不容易的事呢？</p>
<p>現今，爲發展茶葉業的對外貿易計，該業很希望政府當局，除國家銀行舉辦茶葉貸款（該一步驟業已進行）外，協助下項數項：</p>
<p>（一）自民國三十年以後，茶葉外銷中斷，茶商一蹶不振，茶農更是困窮不堪，產量銳減，希望政府，速予救濟。</p>
<p>（二）茶葉為對外輸出大宗之一，過去因茶商墨守成法，不加改良，而政府亦無暇顧此，致茶葉外銷，由第二位而逐步下降：今後，應上下合作，改良製作，以謀復興。</p>
<p>此外，若茶華業公會組織之應力求健全，同業間的應切實團結，合作，以及製品之切忌粗製濫造，亦為勝利後的茶葉業，所應注意的幾件事。</p>
<h3>想的工作</h3>
<p>— 王鸎</p>
<p>在事業的管理方面，想的工作，是非常重要的，因爲任何事情，都要鄭重考慮，然後實行。</p>
<p>要想得周到，第一先要知得透澈，要知得透澈，那末先要從事修養，把管理方面所需要的學識，都加以研究，再與經騐配合起來，可以使想的工作做得更加完滿，所解決的事情，即使不能絕對沒有錯誤，至少可以免除許多不必要的錯誤。</p>

<h3>Dong Yanping Flies to Shenyang to Meet Xiong Shihui; Our Military Delegation to Go to Harbin Soon; National Army Only Sixty-odd Miles from Changchun</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] Dong Yanping flew to Shenyang at noon on the 7th to meet Xiong Shihui, to report on yesterday's conversation with Marshal Malinovsky and to seek instructions. Dong is scheduled to return here on the 8th. The military delegation he leads may move to Harbin within days to continue liaison with the Soviet military headquarters and possibly establish an air station there. It is reported that Marshal Malinovsky, during a conversation with Dong at the station yesterday, expressed his welcome to our military delegation's visit to Harbin. At the same time, Lieutenant General Trotsenko suggested providing a dedicated aircraft to facilitate transportation. Two members of the delegation have already accompanied Marshal Malinovsky to Harbin, and they may be making preparations in advance for the entire delegation to relocate.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Today's farewell rally for the Soviet troops, held by various circles here this afternoon, was attended by Zhu Xinmin and Qiu Nan, members of our military delegation, Mayor Zhao Junmai, and representatives from various sectors. On the Soviet side, attendees included General Zerkov, representing Marshal Malinovsky, Major General Karlov, the city defense commander, and Babrovsky, the Consul General in Harbin. During the meeting, Qiu Nan delivered a speech stating that the comrades-in-arms of the Soviet army and the elite Chinese army, seasoned by eight years of war, would soon be stationed here. We would like to congratulate our allies because they would soon return home and reunite with their families, rebuilding their prosperous and happy lives with the same hands that defeated the enemy during the war. This order is the same goal we defended and sought through arduous battles. After the speech, Zhu Xinmin translated it into Russian, and the Soviet troops present responded with enthusiastic applause. General Zerkov then delivered a reply, stating briefly: The Soviet Union has no territorial ambitions. Therefore, it is not necessary to withdraw after liberating the Northeast. China and the Soviet Union have a need for cooperation in history, geography, economy, and culture. After the meeting, a send-off ceremony was held, and the Soviet troops departed for the station amidst cheers from citizens lining the streets.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The radio station of the New First Army made its first communication with the military radio station here at 9:00 AM on the 7th.

When the reporter asked him about his feelings about his life, he said: His mood is very good. The environment here is like a villa. When he sees the red sun setting every day and the slanting sun reflecting on the surface of the Pearl River, his heart feels refreshed, like flowing water and drifting clouds, and he is filled with joy. He also said that he most enjoys reading, especially Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, but he regrets that his Chinese is not good. When he talked about his feelings on the Chinese battlefield, he said that he had boundless remorse. Needless to say, all the mistakes of the past, Japan needs China to support it in the future to have hope because Japanese culture all comes from China. Finally, the reporter inquired about his family situation. He said that he had two sons, the elder one had already died in battle, and there was only a thirteen-year-old son in Japan.

<h3>Tibetan Representatives to the National Assembly Speak; Do Not Intend to Raise Political Issues; Request Economic Assistance and Cultural Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] According to Shen Zonglian, Director of the Central Government's Office in Tibet, and Zha Sang Sangma Tudan Sangpi, Tibetan representative to the National Assembly, who spoke to our reporter, education in Tibet's pastoral society still requires much effort.

Lhasa currently has a population of over 20,000, with about 1,600 Han people.

We have the right to demand the rectification of China's internal affairs in order to save the latent crisis in the country today. We have even more right to demand the realization of democratic politics in order to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, because with political democracy, today's bureaucratic politics can be eliminated, and with economic democracy, today's bureaucratic capital can be eliminated. We oppose the act of practicing separatism in the name of false democracy. Today, all parties and factions in and out of the government must put the interests of the country and the people first in order to gain the sympathy of the people. In the political sphere, it is first necessary to eliminate the professionalization of political officials and the servility of administrative officials. In the economic sphere, increasing production is the most important task at present. In the military sphere, political orders and military orders must be unified. In the diplomatic sphere, we should get along with our neighbors in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. We oppose all secret diplomacy.</p>

<h3>United Nations Staff Group Drafts Plan to Maintain Peace by Force to Prevent and Suppress Acts of Aggression: US Advocates Transfer of Italian Territories to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] The United Nations Headquarters announced last night: The United Nations Chiefs of Staff, after twelve days of secret consultations, are currently drafting a plan to maintain world peace by military force when necessary. The members of the Staff Committee of the Security Council have now drafted a comprehensive plan for "joint action" by land, sea, and air forces for adoption by the United Nations to maintain world peace. The committee is an international staff group directly under the Security Council, and its mission is to prevent and suppress acts of aggression. Its plan has now been notified to the joint secretariat of the military delegations of the five powers of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] In order to break the deadlock in the peace talks among European countries, the United States is reportedly planning to propose the transfer of all pre-war colonies of Italy to the United Nations. This news was released today by diplomatic circles. At the same time, it was learned that Secretary of State Byrnes has invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Minister Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault to hold a preparatory meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris on the 25th of this month. Britain has already announced its agreement, and France is also expected to agree. However, the Soviet Union has remained silent so far. The Soviet Union had previously requested a postponement of the Paris Peace Conference scheduled for May 1. American officials have publicly expressed pessimism about the lack of progress in drafting peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland due to the many disagreements among the major powers. How to deal with the Italian colonies is one of the most difficult issues. The United States and Britain had originally proposed transferring them to the United Nations for joint management, while the Soviet Union advocated dividing them among countries for individual trusteeship, with Tripoli being entrusted to the Soviet Union. Britain has opposed this.</p>
<h3>Soviets Constructing Defense Works in the Kuril Islands: Munitions Piled Up Like Mountains, All of British and American Origin: Japanese Surrendered Troops Secretly Transported Elsewhere</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] "World News" recently published a report by correspondent Thomson after visiting a secret area, stating that the Soviet army is currently constructing military defense projects in the Kuril Islands, which it occupies north of Japan. It is noteworthy that the munitions piled up there are all of British and American origin. Other situations are as follows: (1) The Soviet army has not repatriated the Japanese surrendered troops in the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin Island. Thousands of Japanese soldiers in the Kuril Islands have been secretly transported by the Soviet army in "large ships" to unknown locations; (2) The Soviet army often patrols the islands near the area, and several places are very close to the American-occupied area, but the American army is now ordered to avoid them; (5) The Potsdam Declaration stipulates that Japan retains the main islands and about a thousand small islands nearby. The Soviet army does not participate in the occupation of Japan. However, the Soviet army has now occupied Etorofu Island in addition to Sakhalin Island, and several islands along the coast. However, the American military spokesperson still refuses to discuss this matter; (4) The American army has not yet effectively occupied the northern part of Etorofu Island. The area is not within the jurisdiction of the Soviet army, but Soviet officers also visit it. The American military spokesperson said that he had received such reports, but had not been able to confirm them; (5) The territorial waters around the Kuril Islands are the best fishing grounds in the world. MacArthur now apparently wants to avoid trouble and has restricted Japanese fishermen to fishing within three miles of the shore; (6) There is a shortage of food for the residents of the Kuril Islands, which has gradually become a crisis. They serve in the Soviet army but receive no food or wages; (7) A large number of Soviet women have arrived on the island, all with the status of "officers". The Soviet army is now transporting various munitions to the Kuril Islands and is building a large airfield. It is also hiring Japanese people to install cannons along the coast targeting the American-controlled area. This is the recent situation on the island. The archipelago consists of thirty-two volcanoes and is about seven hundred miles from the northeastern coast of Siberia.</p>

<p>Further News on the Conflict Between Police and Civilians in Yexie</p>
<p>In Yexie Town, under the jurisdiction of this county, a villager was shot dead by a police officer and five others were seriously injured due to a lantern festival-related incident.  Details of this were reported yesterday. Now, after receiving the report, the county government has dispatched Xie Feipeng, head of the civil affairs section, and Lu Ruoxian, head of the social affairs section, to go to the countryside as soon as possible to investigate the truth. The deceased was a garment worker named Jin A'da, whose abdomen was ruptured and intestines were flowing out, a truly gruesome sight. The four people wounded by gunfire are Zhu Jingen, Chen Jinyu, Gu Youxiang, and Zhong Bodong. Along with Fei Honglin, who was injured in the head by a gun butt, they have all been sent to Rongcheng Hospital in the west of the city for treatment. The three police officers who caused the trouble have absconded with their weapons. The Yexie police station reported that three police rifles and one handgun were seized by the villagers, and all officers and police personnel of the station retreated to Zhangze that night. The exact truth remains to be investigated and recorded.</p>

<p>Xu Gui, a native of Yixing, the former head of the "Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department," previously served as the chief of the Nantong Public Security Bureau, the county magistrate of Jinshan, and an inspector of the Jiangsu Provincial Government before the war. In 1940, due to the adverse turn of the war situation, his will wavered, and he was recommended by Ren Nidao, the commander-in-chief of the pseudo-First Route Army, to successively hold pseudo-positions. After the victory, he was captured by the Wujin County Government and handed over to the High Procuratorate for investigation. The investigation has now concluded, and he has been indicted in the criminal court.</p>

<p>Agricultural Loans Handled by the Anhui Agricultural Bank</p>
<p>The branches of the Chinese Farmers Bank in various parts of Anhui, with the request and assistance of the Anhui Relief Branch, have begun to handle agricultural loans. The loans are divided into categories such as draft cattle, crops, seeds, small farm tools, and fertilizers. The quotas are set at 50 million yuan each for the four items of draft cattle, seeds, etc., and 500 million yuan each for the four items of tea, tobacco, cotton, and silk in the Qimen black tea area of southern Anhui, the Qing tea area of western Anhui, the Tunxi green tea area, and the tobacco, cotton, and silk areas of northern Anhui. The targets are legal cooperatives and farmers' associations, as well as farmers who share the distribution of agricultural materials from the relief agency and jointly use wells and ponds that have been dug.</p>
<p>Illegal Money Houses Exploit with Usurious Interest After Wuhu was recovered, general speculative merchants, seeing the direct rise in prices, opened money houses one after another, pre-collecting heavy interest of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan for every 100,000 yuan loaned to merchants and "errand boys." Money houses are not allowed to be established without the approval of the Ministry of Finance, but these people bribed local governments with heavy sums to obtain a business license and immediately made huge profits, reaching as many as thirty or forty at one time. Although the provincial government recently sent a telegram strictly prohibiting them, they continue to operate secretly as usual. Assuming that each of the thirty houses loans a minimum of 20 million yuan, they can absorb 15 million yuan in heavy interest each month. It is no wonder that prices only rise and never fall.</p>

After counting the losses, it was estimated that they amounted to 20 million yuan. After the bus returned to Huzhou, the incident was reported to higher authorities, who requested that the relevant authorities be instructed to jointly investigate the case.</p>
<h3>Secrets Revealed by a Dancer  Japan Hid Large Amounts of Platinum Planning "Revival of Japan" Capital  Allies Are Salvaging in Tokyo Bay</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 7th] Following the discovery of valuable metals worth 50 million pounds sterling in Tokyo Bay, the Allied government has dispatched investigators to search throughout Japan for Japanese officers who hid the metals in Tokyo Bay. The Americans have now discovered platinum worth 12,500 pounds sterling hidden under a damaged pier, eight feet deep in the water. It is believed that the metals were buried before Japan's surrender, with the intention of using them as capital for the "revival of Japan" in the future. This information was gleaned from a Japanese dancer, who claimed that two truckloads of gold, silver, and platinum were hidden under the supervision of Japanese officers in July of last year by Japanese laborers in Tokyo Bay. Now that the Allies have discovered the metals, they will continue to salvage them.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Northeast in the Next Two Weeks</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 7th, observers today predict that whether the mediation team of the Peiping Executive Headquarters can save the Northeast from a large-scale war, and whether the Soviet Union's promise to withdraw from the Northeast can proceed smoothly with the National Army's takeover, will be severely tested in the next two weeks. The dispatch on the 6th also stated that observers are closely watching the developments in the Northeast situation in the next ten days, believing that this matter has a significant relationship with the situation in the next few years. If we, the ordinary people, are not overwhelmed by "victory" and dream of complacency, then we should not be indifferent to the increasingly serious situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The military three-person team in Chongqing was originally scheduled to fly to Peiping and then to Shenyang on the 5th, but there has been no news of departure to date. Moreover, according to the telegrams received as of last night, it is widely rumored that the three-person team's trip to the Northeast has been postponed indefinitely, and meetings have not even been held in Chongqing. Although the executive team departing from Peiping has gone to the Northeast, the so-called "Communist Army" has gathered 60,000 to 70,000 people in the suburbs of Changchun, with its vanguard only seven or eight kilometers from the city, and constantly sending plainclothes teams to sneak into the city. Harbin is also extremely tense, and military conflicts in various places have not stopped, and instead, there is a tendency to expand. It is likely that the Soviet army in Changchun will be completely withdrawn by the 15th, the Soviet army in Harbin will be completely withdrawn by the 25th, the Soviet army in Jilin City will be completely withdrawn by the 16th, and the Soviet army in Qiqihar will be completely withdrawn by the 27th, while the so-called "Communist Army" has long been plotting to occupy the area as soon as the Soviet army withdraws, in order to prevent the National Government from restoring national sovereignty. We fought a bloody war for eight years to recover the Northeast, and now that we have finally achieved victory, there are actually people using foreign forces to cover up their actions that harm the country and the people, which cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>Originally, the military and political orders of a country should be absolutely unified. Allowing parties to possess armies within a country, and even further recognizing the Communist Army as a unit and executing mediation between the Communist Army and the government army, is already a ridiculous joke from the standpoint of strict military discipline. However, in order to implement peace and stop conflicts, and in order to allow the people to recuperate and recuperate after the war, the National Government has actually agreed to establish a military mediation executive department, and the military two-person team has negotiated a basic plan for reorganizing the National Army and integrating the Communist troops into the National Army, giving the Communist Army a legitimate way out and an opportunity to be loyal to the motherland, which can be considered as benevolent and righteous. According to the measures for stopping conflicts and restoring transportation agreed upon by the government and the Communist Party representatives on January 10 with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall, it was originally stipulated that "Section 2 of the order to stop conflicts does not affect the National Government's troops entering the nine northeastern provinces or being transferred within the nine northeastern provinces to restore sovereignty." It can be seen that, internally, the so-called military mediation measures were originally not applicable to the Northeast. Furthermore, from an external perspective, according to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexed regulations, the Soviet government should take the National Government as the object of assistance, and receiving sovereignty over the Northeast is especially the National Government's undeniable responsibility. Therefore, since the Soviet army has declared that it will complete its withdrawal from the Northeast by the end of April, from the perspective of morality and treaties, the Soviet army has the obligation to facilitate and assist the Chinese National Government's replacement troops. However, the current situation is that the Soviet army's withdrawal is precisely when the Communist Party's so-called "Democratic Allied Army" is stirring up trouble in various parts of the Northeast to the point of being ready. The Communist troops are not allowing the National Army to smoothly accomplish the task of receiving sovereignty over the Northeast, which is truly a case of "Sima Zhao's intentions are known to all." The Communist Party attempts to collude with the Soviet Union externally to transform the Northeast situation, which was originally a diplomatic issue, into an internal political dispute within China, thereby deceiving people all over the world. However, for the sake of Sino-Soviet friendship, far-sighted politicians in the Soviet Union should not be misled by the Communist Party. However, no matter how complicated the situation has been made by the Communist Party, we should always recognize the nature of the Northeast issue. Standing in the position of pure nationals, we must not allow any party or individual to negotiate and coerce the government at this time, relying on its unexplained military force, to arbitrarily occupy the Northeast, obstruct the recovery of national sovereignty, and hinder the integrity of national administration. Regardless of whether it is the "Democratic Allied Army" or the "popularly elected government," before the National Government receives sovereignty over the Northeast and implements the country's administrative power, there is absolutely no room for recognition. If the National Government does not adhere to this position, I am afraid there will be a day when it will be too late to regret!</p>
<p>The Northeast is China's treasure, and the Northeast is China's lifeline. We Chinese people do not know how much blood we have shed and how much suffering we have endured for the Northeast. We Chinese people, for the sake of the Northeast, first raised the banner of anti-aggression throughout the world and fought against the violent Japanese at all costs. Now, half a year after the victory, the factory machinery in the Northeast has been emptied! The mines in the Northeast have been destroyed! The houses in the Northeast have been demolished! The materials in the Northeast have been stolen! The transportation in the Northeast has either been destroyed or blocked! The personnel receiving the Northeast have either been brutally murdered or blocked from entering! Now that the Soviet army is withdrawing as a result of repeated negotiations, it still cannot allow the National Government to smoothly receive sovereignty and implement administrative orders. As long as they are truly Chinese, there is no one who does not feel heartbroken; as long as they are truly Chinese, there is no one who does not gnash their teeth.</p>
<p>Before leaving Changchun, Soviet Marshal Malinovsky repeatedly emphasized the importance and inevitability of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union; the Soviet Moscow News also said that China is a neighbor of the Soviet Union and has always maintained friendship with the Soviet Union. For the sake of peace in the Northeast, for the sake of peace in the Far East, and for the sake of world peace, we indeed always agree with the Soviet Union that the friendly relationship between China and the Soviet Union should be maintained 100%. However, friendship must have a genuine foundation of friendship, and friendship must have a genuine object of friendship. We are willing to frankly offer two sentences to the Soviet authorities and people: (1) The foundation of Sino-Soviet friendship should be built on the words and spirit of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance," and should be built on the sincerity of the two countries' authorities and people. (2) The object of Sino-Soviet friendship, in terms of government, is the government led by Marshal Stalin in the Soviet Union, and the National Government led by Chairman Chiang in China; in terms of people, it should be all the peace-loving people of the Soviet Union in the Soviet Union, and all the peace-loving people of China in China. Therefore, instead of simply trying to curry favor with the Chinese Communist Party, why not show sincerity and trust to the entire Chinese people? Instead of giving the Communist Party the convenience of occupying the Northeast after withdrawing troops, why not assist the National Government in completing the task of receiving sovereignty in accordance with the spirit of the alliance? We sincerely hope to see the friendly relationship between China and the Soviet Union last for at least thirty years, and the longer the better; but we certainly do not want Sino-Soviet friendship to be like the "friendship" that the Japanese used to talk about between China and Japan. Only the sincere friendship between China and the Soviet Union, only the genuine assistance of the Soviet Union to the National Government, and only the complete recovery of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the Northeast can provide a powerful guarantee for peace in the Northeast, peace in the Far East, and even world peace. Otherwise, the day when the Soviet army completely withdraws from the Northeast will be the time when the Communist Party harasses and occupies the area! If so, the Chinese people cannot forgive the Communist Party for its crimes of harming the country and the people. Even towards the friendly allied Soviet Union, if it does not withdraw its troops early or late, but waits until the illegal troops of the Communist Party are prepared to obstruct the National Army's reception work to implement the withdrawal, and does not fulfill its obligation to assist the National Government, we cannot help but feel great regret!</p>

<h3>Can Be Realized in the Near Future Opening Over a Hundred Warehouses Large Quantities of Enemy and Puppet Materials Stored Will Be Publicly Tendered or Auctioned Responsible Person of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau Discusses the Situation of Reception</h3>
<p>In order to clear out warehouses and supply the market with large quantities of materials, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau will open more than 120 enemy and puppet warehouses in the near future and publicly tender or auction the materials stored inside. After these warehouses are cleared out, they will be used to store relief materials from the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and surplus materials from the US military in the Pacific region, which are currently being shipped to China. It is believed that these measures will have a significant effect on suppressing prices. In order to understand the truth of this move, the reporter visited the person in charge of the bureau, who said: This bureau was established two and a half months after the victory. Fortunately, with the assistance of all parties since May, the work has been seen to advance. The most prominent aspects are: (1) In the absence of a joint office of the customs at the wharf warehouse, there is also a company of military police and tax police stationed in each warehouse to assist in guarding. As of March 17, there were 1,136 warehouses sealed and managed by the customs. (2) The tallying of 1,087 warehouses has been completed, and the customs has sent tallying reports to the bureau for 900 warehouses. The rest are being tallied and registered. There are about 200 warehouses of Allied merchants. Half of the materials that have been tallied have been returned to their original owners. There are 139 warehouses of Chinese merchants and banks, which are being actively cleared, identifying materials, and returning them separately, or entrusting various agencies and groups to sell them by warehouse according to regulations, or selling them by warehouse by the bureau. It is expected that one-half to two-thirds of all warehouses can be emptied before the end of April. (3) 626 units of factories have been received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. A total of 142 units have been transferred to the Assets Committee, the Textile Committee, the China Silk Company, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Food for reception; a total of 148 units have been returned; a total of 103 factories have resumed work; a total of 217 factories that can be tendered for sale have been proposed by the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (4) More than 800 units of real estate have been entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for reception, with 1,620 buildings and more than 1,000 acres of land, all of which are to be sold in principle. (5) The solid and liquid fuels are complex in variety. The fuels received by the Fuel Management Committee include 1,080 barrels of gasoline, 55,595.950 tons of bituminous coal, and 142,194.175 tons of anthracite coal. (6) Allied officials and merchants have applied for the return of 132 cars. In terms of air transport, the Aviation Committee has received seven airfields and 170 aircraft. (7) The main food items are flour, corn, soybeans, and sorghum, which have been received by the Commissioner of the Ministry of Food and will be put up for a third public tender of miscellaneous grains. (7) There are a total of 219 educational and cultural institutions. It was also stated that the initial estimate of the total value of the enemy and puppet properties received in Shanghai as of February 20 was approximately 607 billion yuan. This valuation is mostly low and is based on the Shanghai market price at the end of December 1934.</p>
<h3>The City Provisional Council Has Received Sixteen Petitions</h3>
<p>Sorted into Four Categories</p>
<p>After the opening of the City Provisional Council, a total of sixteen petitions were received from citizens, which have been sorted into four categories: (1) Five items related to industry and commerce; (2) Four items related to education; (3) Three items related to housing and land; (4) Four items in other categories.</p>

<h3>To Solve the Serious Electricity Problems in This City Shanghai Power Company Prepares a Three-Year Plan Yesterday's Banquet for City Government Officials and Provisional Councilors  Afternoon Visit to Various Parts of the Power Plant</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] He Qing, President of the Shanghai Power Company, and Fei Lisi, General Manager, etc., hosted a banquet at noon yesterday on the 14th floor of the International Hotel for members of the City Provisional Council and City Government officials. Mayor Qian, Xu Jiyu, directors of various bureaus, councilors, and more than sixty other people attended. During the banquet, Mr. He gave a speech, reporting on the company's business and requesting Councilor Gu to give guidance at any time, so that the city's electricity problem could be solved satisfactorily. Mayor Qian, Xu Jiyu, Zhao Zengjue, and others then gave speeches, expressing their gratitude for the Shanghai Power Company's service to the citizens of the city. Deputy Director Wang Shenshan of the Public Works Bureau translated. The banquet ended at 3:30 p.m., and the attendees then visited the company's power plant in Yangshupu. They were divided into small groups of ten people, led by the plant's engineers to explain the workings of each department. They first went to the steam cooling room, then to the coal transportation area, boiler room, power generation room, general management office, power grid room, and other departments. The plant is large in scale, and all departments are operated by machinery, requiring only a very small number of workers to manage the oiling and calibration work, etc., which is a highly advanced factory organization. However, before the victory, Allied aircraft bombed the power generation room, completely destroying one generator and partially destroying another. These are currently being repaired. In addition, one generator was dismantled by the enemy and transported to Japan. There is also a Skoda machine made in Czechoslovakia, which was installed before the war but has not been used to this day. During the enemy's management period, they planned to use it, but they damaged it in many places because they did not know how to use it. This machine has extremely strong power generation capacity, but if it is to be repaired now, it must be transported back to the original factory in Czechoslovakia for reassembly. At this time after the war, European transportation has not yet recovered, so the plan to transport the machine to Czechoslovakia for repair cannot be implemented for the time being. Since September 17, the company has taken on the full power supply tasks of the Zhabei, Huashang, and Pudong companies, with a total generating capacity of approximately 123,000 kilowatts. However, the coal reserves are often only enough for one or two days or several hours. Fortunately, the US and China authorities have managed to assist in providing supplies in a timely manner, but this situation cannot be a long-term solution. It is hoped that all citizens of the city will cooperate, save electricity, and that Huashang, Pudong, Zhabei, and other power sales companies will do their best to assist. Currently, the French Water and Electricity Company can still supply a small portion of electricity. In terms of economics, since its reception, the company's total losses have exceeded 3 billion yuan. A three-year plan is being drawn up to solve the city's serious electricity problems: (1) The materials manufactured in the United States for the Shanghai Power Company must be quickly airlifted to Shanghai. (2) One 10,000-kilowatt generator at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company should be quickly repaired and put into use. (3) The 24,000-kilowatt floating generator being purchased by President Song should be used for Shanghai. (4) The Shanghai Power Company must purchase and install one 20,000-kilowatt low-voltage generator and one 15,000-kilowatt high-voltage generator. (5) The 22,500-kilowatt generator rotor being repaired in the United States must be repaired and returned to Shanghai. In this way, the power generation capacity can be increased to 200,000 in 1946, 204,500 kilowatts in 1947, and 239,500 kilowatts in 1948.</p>
<h3>Three Car Accidents, One Girl Dead</h3>

<h3>The Most Luxurious Cars Not Allowed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Import Management Office of the Customs had previously stipulated that cars of a certain category must apply for a permit before they can be imported, limiting their factory price to within US$1,200, and prohibiting import if this number is exceeded. A reporter learned from the import and export industry yesterday that the most luxurious American cars, such as the "Lincoln" brand, have horn sounds that form the musical notes "1281." There is also a new product with a glass convertible top that can be opened and closed automatically, but the selling price is all above US$1,200. Therefore, this kind of magnificent car will not appear in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Pickpocket Steals "Shi Ji Ben Ji," Petty Thief Apes Royalty, Impersonates Government Official, Cleverly Steals Briefcase and Flees to Shanxi, Meets a Soulmate in Another Land and Returns, Impersonates Seal Paper and Treachery Exposed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The famous pickpocket nicknamed Xiao Hebei Chen Qiming, 25 years old, makes pickpocketing his regular occupation and has committed numerous crimes. A month ago, Chen stole a briefcase containing important documents from the Military Statistics Bureau, including a letter from the late Director Dai, the highest person in charge of the Military Statistics Bureau. Based on the research of the documents, it was determined that the person who lost the important document was Qi Yimin, a senior official of the Military Statistics Bureau. Xiao Hebei Chen Qiming had a whimsical idea and used the documents as a talisman, openly impersonating the Military Statistics Bureau to engage in something.</p>
<p>However, Chen knew that he was notorious for committing crimes in Shanghai, and many people knew his face, so it was inconvenient for him to stay there permanently. So, he took the important documents with him and carved a seal of the "Investigation Office of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government," as well as a personal seal of Director Dai, and went to Shanxi Province to carry out large-scale activities. He actually took this opportunity to transform from a "petty thief" into a "government official." Later, he met a pickpocket named Sun Zigao in Shanxi (19 years old, from Henan, also making a living by pickpocketing, committed two crimes in Shanghai). They were in sync with each other and colluded with each other.</p>
<p>Until recently, Chen and Sun returned to Shanghai for the second time, living in room 11 of the Shandong Hotel at No. 491 Jiujiang Road. They privately printed a large number of letterhead and envelopes of the "Investigation Office of the Military Affairs Commission" at a printing factory, preparing to take them to Shanxi for use. Unexpectedly, a staff member of the Military Statistics Bureau was also entrusting the printing factory to print other items and glimpsed the large number of stationery printed by Chen, which he found strange. After returning to the bureau and inquiring, no one had entrusted the printing of these items, so it was determined that they were privately printed for illegal purposes. Personnel were dispatched to secretly wait at the printing factory. When Chen went to pick up the goods, he was arrested.</p>
<p>After strict interrogation by the Military Statistics Bureau, Chen knew that it was difficult to hide and admitted to forging the documents. He confessed everything that had happened. They then rushed to the Shandong Hotel and captured his accomplice, Sun Zigao, who immediately surrendered. The bureau believed that the case involved impersonation and unauthorized engraving of seals, which was an act of disrespect for the law. The two criminals were escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation according to law.</p>
<h3>City Government Plans to Build 2,000 Public Housing Units</h3>

<h3>Longhua After the Robbery</h3>
<p>Having been away from Longhua for nearly eight years,</p>
<p>The remaining scenery after the robbery is even more pitiful;</p>
<p>The cherry blossom festival in Eastern Ying is gorgeous,</p>
<p>But how can it compare to the ancient temple by the spring river?</p>
<p>If we</p>
<p>Describe Longhua more precisely, Longhua Ancient Temple and Longhua Pagoda seem to have become Shanghai people's Mecca. During the Spring Festival holidays, it is a must-go place. But after all, it could not escape the clutches of the invaders. The temple was shattered, fortunately, the seven-story pagoda has not been robbed. The reconstruction and repair project of the temple began in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, with the assistance of Huang Jinrong, the great protector, and Zhang Fanggeng, a Buddhist layman. It is now said that 80% of the project has been completed. The reporter wants to find an opportunity to see the new Longhua in person.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the abbot of Longhua Ancient Temple, Shi Shibin, hosted a press conference. The reporter had been away from Longhua for eight years, and it was a special feeling to revisit the old place. On Longhua Road, all kinds of transportation were mobilized. Tourists are like the mountain road in Shanyin, there are old ladies carrying pilgrimage bags, there are young men and women in gorgeous clothes going for an outing, there are neat US military officers, there are boastful scout troops... Next to the temple, there are many simple food shops, but every one is full of guests. Inside and outside the temple, there are many candle and snack stalls, and passers-by are willing to buy a skewer of small tofu, chewing it in their mouths, looking at the green of the fields, it seems that they can wash away the vulgarity of the city!</p>
<p>The tourists in various parts of the temple are like the flood of a tributary, constantly bustling. A batch of red candles on the candlestick has just been taken away, and another batch is lit and inserted. The grand bell and giant drum placed high on the two corners of the temple, the devout men and women could not avoid spending one hundred yuan to climb up the stage and hit or beat them three times, which is said to be able to eliminate disasters and bring good fortune. Some of the 108 Arhats in the Arhat Hall look dark, it is said that there is a lack of gold plating funds, each statue costs 25,000 yuan, many devout men and women put legal tender in the hands of the Arhats. Although the famous Peach Garden has been renovated, the peach trees are pitifully sparse, and cannot hide the scars of the robbery. There is a monument in the garden commemorating the officers and soldiers of the 32nd Army of the National Revolutionary Army, as well as a monument with inscriptions and a list of officers and soldiers of the army, giving tourists meaningful warnings and inspirations!</p>
<p>Abbot Shi Shibin is already 53 years old. He is from Kunming, Yunnan, and has been working in the temple for only three years. He has a slender figure, his face is very dark, and he speaks with a rigid Yunnan accent, and he talks to reporters about the history of Longhua Temple. He said: This temple was founded in the fifth year of Chiwu in the Eastern Wu of the late Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms, and was built by Emperor Sun Quan of Wu... He also introduced his plan to preside over the temple, saying that it will be based on the four characters of "spreading the Dharma and benefiting sentient beings." Also, he wants to open a craft class, so that every junior can produce something besides chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha. He expects that in less than five years, he will no longer rely on fundraising to raise funds for the temple...</p>
<p>Before leaving the temple, I will inevitably visit the pagoda. The crowd at the pagoda gate is like a tide, and it is easy to squeeze into the ranks of climbing the pagoda, climb the stairs, and look far away by leaning on the railing; the rolling waves of the Yangtze River protect the green wheat ridges, the endless vegetable garden, swaying in the wind with a brilliant golden color! On the ruins and dilapidated tiles, the red tiles are faintly visible... This glorious and splendid scenery symbolizes the rebirth of Longhua Ancient Temple, and the future of Shanghai and the motherland! (Canglong)</p>

<h3>Reasonable Distribution of Empty Houses Left by Japanese Nationals Planned, Detailed Rules to Be Announced After Approval</h3>
<p>Recently, the work of sending back Japanese nationals in this city has achieved remarkable results. In order to prevent illegal entry into the empty houses left behind by Japanese nationals in this city, the municipal government, the Third Army Command, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters will send responsible personnel to temporarily seal them, investigate them, and seek reasonable distribution. Yesterday at 2 PM, the War Prisoner Management Office of the Beijing-Shanghai Area held a press conference, presided over by Deputy Director Zou Renzhi and Municipal Government Advisor Dai Jimin. First, Zou reported that the task of the office was to repatriate Japanese nationals and prisoners of war, and that the remaining empty houses would be handled by the municipal government, the Third Army Command, and the Garrison Headquarters. Then, Advisor Dai explained the necessity of managing the empty houses left by Japanese nationals in this city and making reasonable distribution. The detailed rules for management have been drafted and will be announced after approval. A reporter asked whether the municipal government was responsible for the investigation and management of the empty houses left by Japanese nationals. Dai firmly denied it but said that they would be jointly managed. A reporter asked whether the application for use would have to be approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau. Dai replied that except for enemy and puppet properties, approval from the bureau would not be required. A reporter asked whether the shops sealed by the Municipal Property Management Office and the empty houses left after the concentration of German nationals in this city would be managed together or distributed uniformly. Dai replied that they would not be merged, and he did not know the details of their sale or distribution. Finally, a reporter hoped that the houses sealed this time would be reasonably distributed and gave examples of the current unreasonable distribution situation, so he hoped that the handling methods would be more meticulous and fair in the future.</p>

<h3>Impoverished Unemployed Call for Donations to Cover Travel Expenses to Taiwan</h3>
<p>Would Happily Take a Suitable Job Domestically</p>
<p>Mr. Editor—Forgive my lack of formality, but please allow me to use a corner of your newspaper to make an urgent appeal to all sectors of society! I am currently an impoverished person who has lost both schooling and employment. I grew up during the period of the puppet regime during the occupation and studied at a certain middle school for two years. Under the threat of the scourge of life, I finally dropped out of school. During these eight years, in order not to succumb to the enemy and not to betray my conscience, I embarked on the road of exile, wandering and enduring everything, even bleeding! I have seen the most cruel tragedies! But this life has made it impossible for me to breathe. I am almost on the verge of death. Although I am aware that if I continue to be unemployed like this, my future will be buried and my youth will be ruined, alas, who will understand and sympathize with me? After thinking about it, everything is a source of pain. But I still have a grandmother of high age and a hardworking father who does not resign. Why did they raise me? In great pain and disappointment, I ask for help from enthusiastic people from all walks of life in society. Please save this dying young man! The facts I am begging for are as follows: Recently, classmates in Taiwan wrote to me, asking me to go to work. I am also very willing to go to Taiwan, which has returned to the motherland, to develop and cultivate. What disappoints me now is that it takes a lot of travel expenses from Shanghai to Taiwan, and my family cannot afford it at all. I ran around for a few days and could not borrow any money. After selling all my belongings, it was still useless. Under these circumstances, I feel deeply disappointed and cry in pain. I have long known that you, sir, are enthusiastic and righteous, so I pray that you will do your best to give me appropriate assistance. I hope that enthusiastic people can give a little help. I will always be grateful and repay you. The requirements are as follows: (1) Who can lend me some legal tender, so that I can trade for a boat ticket to Taiwan, and I will return it on time, and sign a IOU in person. (2) I earnestly request your newspaper to inquire about all the procedures required to go to Taiwan, and how many days will it take for the ship to sail? (3) If there are enthusiastic people who care and rescue me, even if it is only for one night, seek shelter for me anywhere in the country, regardless of treatment, but only according to my ability. I wish you all the best to readers, Huai Pengfei. (Correspondence address: No. 2, Beishou, Shuigou Nong Nanpengxia, Xitang, Jiashan)</p>
<h3>Reply to Readers</h3>
<p>Yan Sanle asks: I am a 28-year-old male, and in the past two or three years, the hair on the two corners above my forehead has gradually thinned, and the area of ​​bald skin has gradually expanded. Recently, I have also found that the hair on the area of ​​one inch on my ears seems to be there or not, which I think damages my appearance. Now I plan to ask (1) whether this phenomenon is congenital hereditary or acquired, such as caused by thinking too much or wearing hats often? Is it a pathological condition? (2) Is there any way to restore the original state or prevent further deterioration?</p>
<p>Dr. Tang Renjin answers: There are many reasons for hair loss, and those with a large range are difficult to treat, while those with a small range can try salicylic acid preparations. In addition, you can try taking blood tonics and ultraviolet irradiation.</p>
<p>Yang Baorun asks: Every time I see the noble enthusiasm of your column serving the society, I instinctively send out infinite admiration. I am an apprentice in the typesetting room of a printing factory. Every day, I have to focus my attention on individual lead characters, but in March and April last year, when my eyes touched the sky or white paper, walls, etc., in the vision of my right eye, I found a black spot the size of a rice grain rippling; when the eyeball moved, the black spot also floated up and down. I didn't care at the time. After two or three months, the black spot gradually grew into a black line about one inch long, slightly thinner than a matchstick. Please indicate: Is this black line caused by the friction of trachoma on the eyeball? How should it be treated to recover? Dr. Tang Renjin answers: This disease is vitreous opacity, which can be caused by high myopia, iritis, retinitis, choroiditis, and ciliary body diseases. It will not cause blindness, and iodine can be used for treatment.</p>
<h3>Chennault Plans to Return to the US to Summon Old Flying Tigers, Expedite Relief Supplies, and Form an Air Transport Team to Launch Operations in China</h3>
<p>General Chennault told reporters yesterday that he will soon gather former members of the Flying Tigers to organize an air transport team for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to transport relief supplies to various disaster areas. Due to the lack of transportation infrastructure in China, air transport is the most effective way to ensure that relief supplies reach the disaster areas quickly without being obstructed or damaged en route. General Chennault will return to the US within the week to gather former Flying Tiger members and air force personnel willing to join the air transport team, enabling them to come to China from the US for service within a short period. At the same time, some of the US Air Force personnel in China will also serve under Chennault after their demobilization. The organization will operate with a small number of personnel to handle the busy transportation work. The total number of staff in the air transport team is tentatively set at 350. Air transport bases will be established in Hankou, Shanghai, Hunan, Henan, Guangdong, and other regions to expedite the delivery of relief supplies to the most severely affected areas. Chennault's general transportation base will be located in Hankou, from where supplies will be distributed to various disaster areas in the future. Regarding the issue of aircraft, General Chennault believes it will be easily resolved. The air transport team's aircraft can be purchased from the US Foreign Liquidation Commission in the Philippines. Because the current US military transport aircraft in China are difficult to adapt for civilian use. Finally, Chennault stated that he will handle all matters properly during his return to the US and will immediately set off for China to launch operations. It is also understood that Chennault has detailed plans with UNRRA, which will be announced by UNRRA within a day or two.</p>

<h3>Commodity Prices Stabilized Last Week, Speculation Concentrated on Securities, Tong Bing Surpasses 4,000 Mark, New and Old Hong Kong Dollar Notes Converge</h3>
<p>Commodity prices gradually stabilized last week, factories resumed work one after another, production increased, and market inventories grew daily. In the financial sector, gold and banknotes remained stable, and speculative activities concentrated on government bonds and stocks, resulting in repeated peaks. Although the impact is relatively minor, it is not a normal market state, and it is significantly related to the future of industrial and commercial recovery. Therefore, all parties hope that the authorities will determine a handling method as soon as possible. A summary is provided below.</p>
<p>Silver Futures: Last week, the highest price for silver futures was 1.55 million and the lowest was 1.38 million. Fluctuations were due to good actual sales from silver shops and sufficient offsetting. Furthermore, there were many instances of arbitrage and profit-taking, resulting in a market situation of sudden rises and falls. The overall trend for the week was relatively stable, with the opening price on Monday at 1.51 million and the closing price on Saturday at 1.48 million, a decrease of 25,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: The exchange rate of the Central Bank against the US dollar remained unchanged at 2020 yuan. The trend of US dollars was calm, but money exchange shops and members opened more positions. Last week, it fluctuated around 1900, with a high of 1960 and a low of 1860 yuan. The final price at the weekend was 1905 yuan, a decrease of 25 yuan compared to last week. The Hong Kong dollar market was sluggish on Monday. By Wednesday, due to Western newspaper reports that the Hong Kong government announced that new and old notes were indistinguishable and universally accepted, public confidence strengthened, and buying sentiment was strong. Many people were selling old notes and buying new ones. New notes soared from over 200 yuan to 340 yuan, while old notes fell. From Thursday to Saturday, old notes fluctuated weakly, while new notes remained firm. As a result, the prices of new and old notes almost converged.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: On Monday and Tuesday, affected by the decline of Overseas Chinese stocks, the black market continued to weaken. Tong Bing once fell to 2420 yuan, and A, B, D, and E shares also decreased by about 150 yuan each. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, due to the increased absorption in the black market and the stimulus of new Hong Kong dollar notes being universally accepted like old notes, public confidence improved, and all government bonds rose. Tong Bing rose from 2950 yuan to 4000 yuan. At the weekend, due to the tireless efforts of peers, prices soared again. Tong Bing reached 4550 yuan, and Tong E was actively traded, rising to 2650 yuan, 400 yuan higher than types A and B.</p>
<p>Stocks: At the beginning of the week, Overseas Chinese stocks were high and people were worried, so they sold and closed positions, leading to a sluggish market. Foreign stocks also declined. The next day, many Overseas Chinese and foreign stocks were sold off, and prices fell steadily. On Wednesday, Overseas Chinese stocks turned to the upside due to the return of speculative funds. Foreign stocks opened quite briskly, but later became weak due to frequent sales. In the afternoon, there was a slight rebound. On Thursday, Overseas Chinese and foreign stocks rose due to the activity of speculative funds. On Friday, Overseas Chinese stocks were initially very enthusiastic, but later became unsustainable due to more sales. Foreign stocks rallied and then fell, following the same pattern as Overseas Chinese stocks. At the weekend, Overseas Chinese stocks were initially firm, but later entered a hovering state, resulting in lower prices overall. Foreign stocks also declined.</p>
<p>Grains: At the beginning of the week, the consumption of rice increased sharply, rebounding by 500 yuan. Flour exports were sluggish, falling by 300-400 yuan. Sugar prices were weak due to the continued sales by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. The next day, the grain market fluctuated up and down. Glutinous rice fell the most sharply. No. 1 warship and artillery flour both approached the 9,000 mark, and soybeans also declined by several hundred yuan. However, raw peanuts stood out, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. On Wednesday, rice turned from weak to stable, flour's decline slowed down, and the number of buyers of edible oil increased sharply, with prices rising by 3,000 yuan. On Thursday, grains and edible oil turned to the downside. Due to the abundance of goods in the market and the lack of confidence among peers, the sugar market worsened. From Friday to the weekend, the grain market was closed due to the holiday.</p>
<p>Raw Yarn: In the past week, initially supported by the previous weekend's rally, long positions were aggressively pushed up, and major buyers from Guangdong and Hubei were actively purchasing, leading to a sharp rise in fine yarn, which created a new high price. Subsequently, due to the lack of development in gold and stocks, the actual demand from buyers weakened, and long positions sold off at high prices. Short positions took advantage of the situation to exert pressure, and the weekend saw a sharp downturn. The highest price for the week was 3.01 million for No. 6 Shanghai Branch Nikko double-strand fine yarn on Wednesday, and the lowest was 530,000 for No. 10 Jiahe yarn on Saturday. The current yarn market is characterized by fine yarn being weak and unstable while coarse yarn is stable. This is largely because current flower prices are cheap, and factories can make substantial profits by buying flowers and spinning yarn, especially fine yarn. Therefore, the Spinning Construction Corporation is taking over Japanese-owned yarn factories and actively producing and selling yarn in the market, increasing the inventory in Shanghai. Furthermore, the peak sales season has passed. If buyers lack large sales channels, the future market trend is likely to be prone to decline rather than rise.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: Initially stable, but later, as more buyers and shopkeepers adopted a wait-and-see approach, the market was flooded with inventory. Many factories were selling, and long positions with inventory also adopted a depreciated sales approach. On Saturday, Daming Fu silk fell by 68,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan lower than the previous Saturday. The trend of Shilin cloth, which fell by 3,000-4,000 yuan each, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth and 16-pound coarse cloth seemed more moderate, showing a mediocre situation. The flower market was weak due to the weakness of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, and prices also decreased slightly by 2,000-3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Prepares US$100 Million to Purchase Materials for Relief in China, Including Ships, Food, and Medicine</h3>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 7th) Howard, Director of the Pacific Region of the US Foreign Liquidation Commission, announced that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is preparing to purchase surplus US Army and Navy ships, medicines, and food for US$100 million for relief in China. He stated that the disposal of these surplus materials will at least allow the United States to abandon three bases. Of the aforementioned US$100 million, US$40 million will be used to purchase ships and port equipment, 50,000 tons of flour, beans, and other dry food, and medicines. UNRRA has already used US$30 million to purchase property from the Foreign Liquidation Commission for use in China. As a result of the above measures implemented by the United States, every dollar of cost can recover 37 cents.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Rice Difficult to Export</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris Report] According to reports from Vietnam, at the end of January, the rice inventory in the Saigon-Cholon area was about 59,000 tons. In addition, 39,000 tons of rice were found in the warehouses of the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. This inventory was earmarked for use by the British army. The rice inventory in the interior of Vietnam is estimated at about 185,000 tons, but as of now, the Allied forces have not been able to control it. On the other hand, consumption in the Saigon-Cholon area is about 8,500 tons per month. In addition, 13,000 tons of rice were shipped to the Tokyo area in January to relieve local famine, and another 15,000 tons were shipped in February. Therefore, Vietnam will have no surplus rice for export this year.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Softens</h3>
<p>Tinplate prices were once quite firm due to the sharp increase in actual sales, but since the end of last month, they have shown signs of recession again. Buying prices have gradually softened. This is certainly due to a sharp decrease in demand and sluggish actual sales, but the rumor of overseas arrivals is also a factor. However, in reality, only dozens of boxes of double sheets were brought in from Hong Kong. However, people's pessimistic view is indeed the truth. Among various types of goods, double-count tinplate is more volatile. Recently, goods from Hong Kong are only selling for about 230,000 yuan per box. 200-pound company iron has also fallen sharply, with a bid of just over 200,000 yuan per box. However, 110-pound kerosene box blanks have changed little in price because actual sales are smoother.</p>

<h3>Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau Discusses Post-War Japanese Education</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, who recently returned to Shanghai from Japan to inspect education, told reporters: "I was ordered by Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education to go to Japan for inspection, and the scope is not limited to post-war Japanese education. I left the country on February 25 and stayed in Tokyo, Yokosuka, Kure, Hiroshima, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Gifu, Nagoya, and other places for about 30 days. I have made a general inspection of the educational facilities in various places and will submit a detailed report to the Ministry of Education for review. The post-war Japanese educational institutions are generally complete, and the facilities are also very sound. Except for special scientific research institutions that were suspended due to the war, the rest are still running normally, which is definitely not as badly damaged as in our country. The current trend in Japanese education is the same as in politics and economy. After the defeat in the war, there has been a transformation, and under the promotion and infusion of American educational thought, it has been automatically improved. During my stay in Japan, I met many professors from the Imperial University, who expressed their willingness to accept the new enlightenment of American education."</p>

<h3>The Education Bureau Sends Personnel to Take Over Zhenghang and Lehua Schools</h3>
<p>[This City Report] A dispute arose over the issue of new and old principals at Zhenghang Girls' Middle School and Lehua Primary School in this city, resulting in the forced takeover by armed soldiers, which led to the intervention of the Garrison Command. In addition, the school's early spring break caused students and teachers to petition. Since the school board of directors could not be reorganized within a short period of time, the school's dispute could not be resolved smoothly. In order to maintain students' studies, the Municipal Education Bureau specially appointed Chu Fengyi, a member of the school's board of directors, to temporarily take over Zhenghang Girls' Middle School, and Hu Huiyuan to temporarily take over Lehua Primary School, so that school affairs can proceed as usual.</p>
<h3>Donghua Loses 1-2; Qingbai Wins Group A Championship; Yiyuan Stadium Sees Unprecedented Crowd of 20,000</h3>
<p>In the final match of the Group A football league championship, Qingbai defeated Donghua 2-1 yesterday morning amidst an unprecedented crowd, winning the championship. No goals were scored in the second half. The game was tense and exciting, with an audience of over 20,000 at Yiyuan Stadium. All 16,000 pre-sold tickets were sold out before 9:00 AM. This led to complaints from fans who arrived later. A city stadium employee named Yang Jingwan was even beaten by unreasonable individuals. The ticket booths were stormed by those who couldn't buy tickets, and thieves seized over 300,000 yuan in ticket revenue, an unprecedented event in football matches.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Qian, Chairman Wu, and others attended the game. The order inside the stadium was initially well-maintained. However, about five minutes before the game started, because some team management needed to enter the field, the audience took the opportunity to push down the newly built but flimsy fence, swarming into the stadium and crowding along the white lines of the field. Although the game was able to proceed to the end smoothly, it was inevitably less than ideal due to the chaos.</p>
<p>Qingbai's Offense and Defense Were Both Excellent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the two teams were evenly matched. Qingbai's offense and defense were both excellent. The defenders Meng Yiliang and Yan Shixin made it difficult for the Donghua players A Dai, Long Hai, and Youliang to move and coordinate. The activity of the forwards Cao Qiuting and Li Yichen allowed them to control the offense in the first half. Donghua's one-goal deficit was simply a matter of luck in an otherwise even game.</p>
<p>First Half: Two to One</p>
<p>The game started at 10:10 AM, delayed due to the audience storming the field. With the whistle, Donghua took the lead. Less than three minutes into the first half, Li Zhuang scored. However, Qingbai became more courageous as the game went on. Li Yichen and Gu Yisa scored successively, putting Qingbai ahead 2-1 in the first half. No goals were scored in the second half. At the start of the game, Donghua passed the ball forward. Sun Jinshun received the ball and headed it to Li Yao. Li took a long shot, and the ball came straight down into the Qingbai goal. Qin Bi Gao jumped up to catch it but only managed to touch it with his fingers, and the ball went into the net. Donghua, taking advantage of the situation, was greatly encouraged by this unexpected goal. At this time, Qingbai focused on defense, with Yan Shixin single-handedly resisting the attacks, putting on an excellent performance. By the 25th minute, Qingbai counterattacked. Fei Chunhua got the ball and crossed it. Zhang Banglun created an open space, and Li Yichen took the opportunity to shoot, tying the score at 1-1. From then on, Qingbai became increasingly dominant. The forwards had more and more opportunities because they frequently received passes from the back. In the 40th minute, Fei Chunhua took a corner kick. Cao Qiuting hooked the ball back, placing it perfectly. Gu Yisa received the ball and volleyed it in, putting Qingbai ahead 2-1. Soon after, the first half ended, with Qingbai winning 2-1.</p>
<p>Donghua's Counterattack Ineffective</p>
<p>After the break, Donghua switched Youliang and Longhai's positions, and Zhuang Youren replaced Zhang Linggen, who moved forward. Donghua was determined to recover and initially showed a fierce momentum. In the fifth minute, Dai Linjing attempted an overhead kick from the ten-yard mark, but it was too weak and caught by Qin Bi Gao. Fifteen minutes later, Sun Jinshun took a long shot from twenty yards out. Qin caught it but then lost it, and Dai Linjing rushed up but was still saved by Qin. Donghua failed to score despite repeated attacks and inevitably became discouraged. Qingbai, having weathered the storm, became active again. Xu Wenkui was replaced by Luo Fufu due to a foot cramp. The new strength on the field also put in a lot of effort, so at this time, Donghua could not attack and was forced into a defensive position. Until the last five minutes, Meng Yiliang committed a foul, resulting in a free kick. Sun Jinshun took the free kick from within twenty yards, shooting it wonderfully. Qin Bi Gao jumped up and pushed it out, avoiding disaster. Donghua failed to score this goal and was unable to save the game, which ended abruptly.</p>

<p>Also, in another Group A match yesterday, the Soviet Union played the British Navy at Jiaoyuan at 1:00 PM. The Soviet Union, with Robert Stov joining the team, was indeed different. They defeated the British effortlessly, 3-0 in the first half, and 5-1 in the end. The Soviet Union defeated the British Navy.</p>
<h3>How to Channel Floating Capital</h3>
<p>— Xu Weizhou</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the wealth of wealthy people in occupied areas has concentrated in Shanghai, which is considered safer and commercially more prosperous, to engage in the most secure hoarding or gold acquisition. This huge amount of floating capital, with no fixed date or direction, has been widely criticized. Because it goes to gold, gold prices soar; it goes to materials, material prices rise, causing hardship for the people and creating all kinds of unrest. Since the Central Bank openly supplies foreign exchange and gold, and goods gradually arrive in abundance, this terrible floating capital has turned to stocks. In recent weeks, stock prices have soared uncontrollably. If it is not properly guided, its harm to legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises is deeply worrying.</p>
<p>After the victory, the floating capital in the occupied areas was initially affected by the two-hundred-to-one exchange rate, and its fluctuating power weakened considerably. Since huge sums of money from the free areas have continued to be remitted; in addition to the banks, money shops, trusts, insurance, and various business companies organized during the enemy and puppet periods, although they have ostensibly ceased operations, many are still actively operating. Furthermore, due to the endless labor disputes and the dramatic increase in wages, the industrial and commercial enterprises that are preparing to proceed have found that there is no profit to be made, and have had to change course, and wait and see. As a result, the amount of floating capital is even greater than during the enemy and puppet periods. Once it flows into the stock market, stock prices soar and reach peak after peak. Although some stocks may be sold at a high price to purchase the latest equipment to increase future output, it must be known that the management rights are not lost after the stocks are sold. Investors must pay close attention to whether these managers are completely stable and reliable. The rubber stock affair at the end of the Qing Dynasty is still vivid in our minds. I am not deliberately creating alarm, but confirming what you are hearing. Today's investors in stocks may not be without such caution, but with the widespread mentality of valuing things and devaluing money, everyone is trying to profit in the short term, and often does not have time to consider the actual value of the stock itself. Therefore, I believe that the stock exchange urgently needs to resume operations and should not be delayed any longer. Only in this way can the assets of listed stocks be examined, and the production, sales status, and whether the stocks that directors and supervisors should hold are sealed in accordance with the law can be investigated.</p>
<p>I believe that after the stock exchange resumes operations, it can expand its business scope, taking advantage of the common mentality of valuing things and devaluing money, and trusting foreign exchange and despising legal currency, to simultaneously auction British pounds and US dollar public bonds in Shanghai, to enrich the chips. On the one hand, increase the number of public bonds in circulation, and encourage real estate activities, such as reducing real estate taxes, and simplifying the transfer procedures of land ownership certificates and deeds, so that the convenience of buying and selling or mortgaging land is the same as stocks and bonds. The income of the national treasury and the municipal treasury can be increased, and the destination of floating capital can also be expanded. This may also be a means of regulating finance and stabilizing the market.</p>
<h3>Bombay Gold and Silver Market; Speculative Activity Very Acute</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th Dispatch] According to "The Economist" magazine, the Indian government's crackdown on speculative activities in the Bombay gold and silver market has not yet achieved significant results. According to an official of the Ministry of Finance, the purpose of raising the import tax on gold and silver is to thwart speculative activities, but the result is the opposite, because the new tax is not enough to balance the difference between the prices in the Bombay and international markets, but rather makes the difference more significant. The price of gold in Bombay is 99 rupees per ounce, equivalent to 394 shillings per ounce, which is 129% higher than the price in London. According to Indian government regulations, the import tax on gold is 25 rupees per tola (equivalent to 180 grains of pure gold), and the import tax on silver is increased by 8 annas per ounce.</p>
<h3>There is Talk of Continued Gold Arrivals</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize gold prices, the government authorities are selling unlimited amounts of gold daily through the Central Bank, and the amount has reached 4,000 bars. It is said that they will continue to sell in the future, and a large amount of gold will be shipped from abroad to this port.</p>
<h3>Appeal from Seventeen Schools in Distress; Hope for a Solution Before the Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter: Mu Ren</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has been won, and everything is brewing for reconstruction. However, looking at the results of reconstruction in the past six months, there does not seem to be much progress to report, especially in educational reconstruction.</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a country. At this time when everything after the war is waiting to be rebuilt, we should cultivate talent for national construction more. However, seeing the widespread loss of education for young people and the school panic all over the country makes us doubt the government's repeated claims of how much it values education.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at a reception for journalists hosted by the Shanghai Private Schools Association for Schools in Distress, Chairman Sun Xiangzhong, on behalf of schools such as the Patriotic Girls' School, Chongde Girls' Middle School, Xinhua Art Teachers' School, Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers' School, Mingde Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, Guangdong Girls' Middle School, Chengzhong Middle School, McLaren Middle School, Nianhua Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, Junxiu Girls' School, Boren Middle School, Yuyu Middle School, Xinmin Middle School, and universities such as Datong University and Chizhi College, stretched their necks, raised their voices, and cried out loudly to government authorities and people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Chairman Sun said: "Our schools have been either completely destroyed or partially damaged in this war. School equipment has been lost and the losses are huge. During this period of post-war reconstruction, recovery is not easy. If fortunately some or all of the buildings are preserved, they are mostly occupied by the military. Although we have repeatedly appealed in joint names to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, the Envoy of Comfort, the Senate, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and the Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property, requesting the allocation of enemy property buildings and repair expenses of 10,000 yuan per school, so far there has been no result. They either say that they have submitted a request to the supervisory authority for approval, or say that it 'must be handled by the central or local government in a unified manner.' They push each other around and no one takes responsibility. It has been half a year since the victory, and another semester is coming to an end. Many of our schools are either still suspended or struggling with makeshift facilities. We feel that we can no longer delay like this. On April 6, we sent a special express telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting that he order the Shanghai Municipal Government to allocate enemy property buildings and repair funds."</p>
<p>"For the sake of national education and the future of the nation, we hope that the government authorities can provide assistance and find a solution before the summer vacation." Chairman Sun concluded his speech in this impassioned manner.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Municipal Education Bureau stood up to speak amidst applause. He recounted the difficulties of the Education Bureau's situation. After the victory, the Education Bureau was unable to fully exercise its power to receive enemy and puppet schools. For example, when receiving puppet schools, it only received a group of students. Therefore, a few days ago, it proposed to the Municipal Provisional Council that all military units should vacate the schools they occupied.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Li also said: Recently, the Third War Area Army and the Japanese Residents Management Office intend to transfer enemy and puppet properties to the municipal government for disposal. Mayor Qian has verbally agreed that if the municipal government has the power to dispose of these houses, it will first allocate them to schools, and then to government offices and municipal government staff dormitories.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Deputy Director Li also suggested that the schools in distress should prepare a list of losses and submit it to the government, so that they can be used to clear and claim old debts from Japan in the future. "The Education Bureau is very concerned about this matter and will do its best to help, but its power is weak. I hope everyone can understand this effort." Deputy Director Li said in conclusion.</p>
<p>Walking out of the meeting, I thought of the many students without schools to attend: "Education first! Is education really first?"</p>
<h3>Rice Granaries Empty! Roads Treeless! Hunan Disaster Victims Litter the Ground</h3>
<p>— Changsha Correspondence, March 25th, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>The severity of the disaster in Hunan has recently garnered significant attention from all sides. According to those who have inspected the disaster areas in Hunan province, the situation seems even more dire than the Shaanxi famine of the 20s and the Henan famine of the 30s. Hunan, which has been widely recognized as China's granary in recent years, has been reduced to a state of having no food to eat, and one can imagine the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>Over the past week, this reporter has been in contact with various parties and, after synthesizing their opinions, they unanimously believe that (1) due to the enemy's devastation before the victory and (2) due to the muddled disasters after the victory, southern Hunan has fallen into a predicament where there is no peace and everywhere is barren.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Loss of Manpower and Draft Cattle</p>
<p>Of course, the enemy's devastation before the victory affected more than just Hunan province. However, after the Battle of Wuhan, Hunan became the gateway to the nation. Over the past seven years, the battles, which occurred almost every time after the autumn harvest, gave the countryside no respite. Loss led to decline, and decline led to bankruptcy. According to statistics from the Hunan branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (NRRA), the province lost as many as 642,788 head of draft cattle alone. The loss of manpower, including deaths, injuries, illnesses, and those affected, totaled 2.25 million people. Among them, poor farmers accounted for the majority of deaths due to corvée labor and disease, totaling 1.5 million people. The only wealth of the countryside is manpower. Now, with 1.5 million people lost and such a huge loss of draft cattle, even the wealthiest granary cannot avoid a reduction in production. Moreover, Hunan's reputation as a surplus grain-producing area is merely a facade. In reality, farmers often exchanged coarse grains for staple grains in order to sell them for export, which was the main source of rural finance. Currently, with coarse grains in short supply, they inevitably have to rely on staple grains for their livelihood. Thus, this paper lantern collapses with a single poke, and the disastrous situation immediately becomes apparent.</p>
<p>Agricultural Implements and Seeds Completely Destroyed, Nothing Left</p>
<p>While the countryside's manpower and draft cattle have suffered such significant losses, other agricultural implements, seeds, and houses were also completely destroyed during the enemy's occupation and wartime. Consequently, the phenomenon of tenant farmers abandoning their land and fleeing the famine has surged. The tenant farmers of the Xiangxiang County Middle School's property made two demands to the school: (1) to relinquish their tenancy, (2) if they must continue farming, then please provide draft cattle, seeds, and capital; otherwise, they can only let the land lie barren. The general situation in Xiangxiang is like this. Other counties are roughly the same. Farmers on both sides of the railway in Hengshan County have left their land and come to the soup kitchens set up by the Hunan branch of the NRRA at the Dabao and Xialiugou railway stations for food. In the villages, one or two families can still be seen plowing with humans pulling the plow, and these are still considered better-off families. The desolation is even more widespread in Qiyang and Lingling. People no longer distinguish between yours and mine. Under the premise of survival, they live for as long as they can. As a result, various illegal and disruptive acts continue to occur. Qi Xiude, the magistrate of Lingling County, reported that 248 people had died of starvation, all verified with names by the baojia chiefs. Yu Jichuan, director of the Hunan branch of the NRRA, personally inspected the situation and brought back eight kinds of grass roots and bark that the people were eating. It is said that these samples have been sent to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in New York.</p>
<p>The situation is equally serious in the counties of northern and central Hunan, such as Pingjiang, Liuyang, Yueyang, and Xiangyin, as well as the lakeside counties of Nanhua and Anxiang. Many of the dikes and embankments around the lakes have also been destroyed by the enemy. Many lake fields are flooded and cannot be cultivated. Farmers not only lacked cotton quilts in winter, but they did not even have a single cotton garment. Because a large number of ships were destroyed, transportation is extremely inconvenient, and the circulation of goods is a major problem.</p>
<p>"Muddled Disasters" Add at Least Half to the Disaster</p>
<p>The muddled disasters after the victory have added at least half to the disaster situation. Taking Xiangyin as an example: When the army marched north, many houses were demolished to build bridges for the sake of transportation convenience. Even the tower railings and pillars were torn down. There were also instances of digging up graves and taking unrotted coffins to build bridges. A considerable number of troops passed through Hunan, and although it was only temporary, it did cause some disturbance to the disaster-stricken countryside. Taking chickens and ducks, buying grain, some were indeed consumed by the troops themselves, while some were resold to become civilian grain and food for profit. Even though the Third War Area has been in the Shanghai-Nanjing area for half a year, there are still personnel from the Third War Area requisitioning ships in You County today, making it impossible to transport the coal produced there. The price of coal in Changsha has suddenly doubled.</p>
<p>Emergency Relief and Work Relief Cannot Solve the Problem</p>
<p>The Hunan branch of the NRRA has been established for more than half a year, and their work ethic is commendable. However, due to transportation limitations, they have only distributed 1,000 bags of old clothes and 300 bags of old shoes in terms of supplies (many of the old shoes are high-heeled leather shoes, which seem to be of no use in the countryside). Several hundred tons of flour were distributed, and some of the flour was damaged by moisture during transportation from Wuhan to Changsha. Although the number of tons of flour transported to Hunan is over 700, the actual amount received is not much, and almost all of it has been allocated to Hengyang, Qiyang, and Lingling for emergency relief and work relief.</p>
<p>The branch has indeed made the greatest effort in emergency relief. According to staff members, they focused almost all of their efforts on emergency relief in southern Hunan during January and February. The number of soup kitchens in Lingling was increased from one to four, and the number of people sheltered was increased from 500 to 1,000. For work relief, the planned Lingdao Highway, Lingdong Highway, and Shaoxin Highway were successively started, but the continuous rain has greatly affected progress.</p>
<p>Empty Gestures Farmers Don't Want</p>
<p>Emergency relief and work relief still cannot solve the problem. What the people need is their own land. However, the restoration of their own land requires draft cattle, agricultural implements, seeds, fertilizers, capital, and labor. Therefore, agricultural loans are the most urgent need at present. However, the agricultural loans that are actually available are completely unsuitable for the needs of the common people. The first phase of agricultural loans jointly organized by middle farmers and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration amounted to only 120 million yuan. They were distributed to 25 counties and cities severely affected by the disaster, such as Changsha, Hengyang, Qiyang, Yueyang, Linxiang, Xiangtan, Hengshan, Changning, and Xiangxiang. The original maximum amount for each county was 8 million yuan, but because of excessive competition for loans, it was changed to at least 8 million yuan. But this amount is indeed a drop in the bucket and does not help. Although the total amount for each county is 8 million yuan, how much is actually distributed to each borrowing farmer? Assuming that there are 1,000 households requesting loans in each county, each household can only borrow 8,000 yuan. This small amount is far from enough to buy cattle (the price of cattle in Hunan is at least 200,000 yuan per head). They can buy seeds but have no agricultural implements, or they can buy agricultural implements but have no fertilizer. It's truly ridiculous! It is said that of the 8 million yuan in Hengyang, only over 1 million yuan has been loaned out to date because farmers are unwilling to accept this empty gesture.</p>
<p>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has prepared a plan for the implementation of post-war agricultural relief in Hunan province and submitted it to the headquarters for approval: (1) Regarding the proposal to purchase 100,000 head of draft cattle first, the headquarters believes that such a huge number is actually impossible to purchase and the required funds are too large. There are currently no funds available for allocation. Distribution in Hunan will be considered when the UNRRA ships draft cattle in the future. (2) Regarding the proposal to manufacture 400,000 sets of agricultural implements such as plows, harrows, and hoes, the headquarters believes that local blacksmiths may not be able to supply such a quantity. The UNRRA will supply some small agricultural implements in the future. The request should be discussed later. The numbers proposed by the branch are indeed huge, but they are indeed urgently needed in southern Hunan at present. However, there are no such huge funds available, and if nothing is done, there is no way to provide relief. The disaster-stricken people can only resign themselves to fate.</p>
<p>Dysentery and Malaria Claim the Lives of Ordinary People</p>
<p>The diseases that come with hunger are exerting tremendous pressure on the starving people. People in various places are widely infected with dysentery and malaria due to malnutrition, cold, and starvation. Qi Dexiu, the magistrate of Lingling County, stated in his official report that over 10,000 people have died due to dysentery and malaria and lack of medicine. The number of deaths is the highest in Zhicheng town and the townships of Jingzhong, Quanzhong, and Qingping under the county's jurisdiction. The number of patients is three times that of the deceased. The number of patients in Xiangxiang County is increasing daily. There is a shortage of medicinal materials in the villages of Xiangxiang (referring to traditional Chinese medicine). The prescriptions prescribed by the doctors cannot be fully purchased in the pharmacies, and the villagers do not have the ability to go to the city for diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, they can only lie in bed and let the disease develop naturally. The "Report on the Epidemic and Disaster Caused by the Enemy" compiled by the Hengyang Senate announced that thousands of people in Hengyang are dying from epidemics every day. More than 90,000 people have died from epidemics in the past three months. The common illnesses are cholera and dysentery.</p>
<p>Exempting Military Grain from Collection Listed as the Top Priority</p>
<p>Delegations requesting relief are coming to Changsha to petition one after another. Invitations to report on the disaster situation to all sectors of society are everywhere, but those who make the requests do so on their own, and those who handle the requests do so on their own. It is completely useless. The relief requesting delegations almost come from all 78 counties and cities in the province.</p>
<p>In the high tide of appeals for disaster relief, naturally, requesting exemption from the requisition and purchase of military grain is listed as the top priority. Mr. Chou Shuofu, the representative of Xiangyin, said with grief at a reception for the press: "Along the highways, railways, and rivers in Xiangyin, there are no trees left. They have all been cut down. At the end of the war, Xiangyin had five county governments, all of which required the people to provide supplies. Please consider, to what extent is Xiangyin suffering? During the occupation, the enemy seized 100,000 shi of husked rice. How much grain is left for the people? Now, the government wants the people of Xiangyin to requisition and purchase 165,000 shi of military grain. In order to abide by the law, the people have come up with two solutions: (1) Ask the government to send personnel to search people's homes. If there is grain, it will be sealed. (2) The people will pay money and ask the government to send personnel to purchase freely from the people at market prices. Apart from the price limit, the people are willing to pay the money that is not enough. In fact, the army has already searched every household and found no grain." Another representative said: "Xiangyin not only has no grain to sell, but the people are already eating grass. Not a single cent of agricultural loans has reached the people. We have come to the province to cry out for justice and request relief agencies to provide relief as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Although the representatives from the counties spoke so grievously about the issue of military grain, the deputy director of the Hunan Provincial Field and Grain Management Office, who is responsible for purchasing military grain, formally announced at a reception for news reporters the current quantity purchased and the difficult supply situation. He said: "According to the statistics in the reports from the counties, only over 70,000 shi of military grain have been collected. For the portion purchased freely at market prices, it is only over 100,000 shi (according to the total amount to be purchased, it is 1.6 million shi). Currently, the grain funds are tight, and it is impossible to continue purchasing freely at market prices. However, the amount of grain to be purchased by the counties is still large. It is extremely difficult to appeal for exemption from purchase, which has led to the fact that the troops stationed in Hengyang, Changsha, and Yueyang are about to run out of food, and the Japanese prisoners of war have been reduced to eating thin gruel or begging for food. The situation is serious and difficult to sustain." It is heard that a senior military official said when participating in a discussion on the issue of military grain purchase at the provincial government: "If military grain cannot be purchased and the army has no write [error in original text], then what am I responsible for regarding the relationship between the military and the people?"</p>
<p>Disasters Surround How Will the Long Years Be Passed?</p>
<p>On the one hand, it must be done, and on the other hand, it must be abolished. There is still no solution. Someone suggested handling it according to the Sichuan method of requisitioning from large households. Because there are indeed many large landlords in Hunan, some of whom collect 30,000 to 50,000 shi of grain every year. Letting them take out more may alleviate the current urgent need. However, the government has not formally proposed this method due to certain special relationships.</p>
<p>From the various situations described above, it is truly worrying to speculate on future developments. The current disaster situation can simply be said to be just emerging, or it can be said to be a warning of a great tragedy. Spring plowing is imminent, but farmers are completely unprepared. Even if spring plowing is possible, the autumn harvest is still months away. How will these long years be passed? It is truly worrying!</p>
<h3>The Panic of Clothing, Food, and Housing - Enveloping All of Japan</h3>
<p>— Tokyo Dispatch, March 21st. A Joint Report from Jinbiao and Leiyun</p>
<p>"The people regard food as heaven." The greatest suffering in Japan is the shortage of food, which was the case during the war and even more so after the surrender. In recent years, the lack of fertilizer and the decrease in labor have created two major agricultural problems. Last year's rice crop was the worst in fourteen years. As soldiers and overseas nationals are repatriated to Japan, the situation will only worsen. Between natural disasters and man-made calamities, the people are unable to bear their fate. Last year, a certain European observer and a certain Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry simultaneously issued predictions that if foreign food is not imported this year, ten million Japanese citizens will suffer from malnutrition due to hunger, and then develop diseases and die.</p>
<p>Since Japan started the war with the United States in 1941, it has been aware of the panic regarding supplies and began to thoroughly control food. As a result, rice could not be bought in restaurants, and vegetables, oil, and sauces were also purchased and rationed. Farmers who cultivated the land were required to supply the government with all of their harvest according to the yield and official prices. The government rationed the minimum amount of food needed to sustain human life to the people. Originally, an adult male could receive a daily ration of two and a half 合 (gō) of rice, equivalent to 330 cubic centimeters (with proportional reductions for the elderly, children, and women). This rice had to be mixed with 20% of miscellaneous grains. Initially, Tokyo citizens could still receive a fish ration every four days, but as the war situation became increasingly tense and resources became increasingly scarce, the ration was temporarily reduced by 10% last autumn, to only 297 cubic centimeters per day. The proportion of miscellaneous grains mixed in increased from 30% to 70% after the war ended. These included no fewer than twelve types of grains, such as soybeans, buckwheat, corn, sorghum, barnyard millet, and soybean cakes, which could not be boiled soft or chewed thoroughly and had to be swallowed down with difficulty. As for the rationing of side dishes, such as vegetables, fish, and oil,</p>
<p>Professor Dies of Malnutrition; Government Advises Citizens to Pick Mulberry Leaves as a Tea Substitute</p>
<p>In Tokyo alone, an average of 1.5 million women had to spend three hours queuing up to purchase food with coupons each month, but the necessary vegetable intake for Japanese citizens was about 250 grams per person per day. In September 1943, the average daily vegetable ration for Tokyo citizens was 248 grams; in September 1944, it was 92 grams; and in September 1945, it was 25 grams. After that, the rationing of side dishes ceased altogether. A family of six was only rationed two scallions for three days. A professor at a famous specialized school died of malnutrition, later diagnosed as due to too little chlorophyll and a lack of Vitamin B, which caused an outcry. The government was unable to maintain even the production and rationing of tea leaves, so it advised the people to pick mulberry leaves as a tea substitute and ordered Tokyo citizens to pick five grams of persimmon tree leaves every day to boil in soup and eat, in order to supplement the vitamins lacking in vegetables and tea leaves.</p>
<p>Regarding the calories generated by food in the human body, the common measure is "calories." Generally, even if a person lies still and does nothing, they still consume 1,300 calories per day to maintain life. This is equivalent to 370 grams of rice. If they do some daily activities or work, they need 2,200 calories. During the previous world panic, investigations in the Dutch East Indies showed that the minimum necessary caloric intake for human survival was 1,800 calories per day. Currently, the average food intake of Japanese citizens is 1,500 calories per day. According to a survey by the Japanese government after the end of the war, the population was 72 million (with women outnumbering men by 4 million), but the average annual rice harvest was 65 million 石 (koku), which was consistently insufficient. Last year, two major typhoons and floods destroyed iron bridges, causing the greatest damage since the founding of the national railway. Therefore, the autumn harvest was further reduced from the expected 46 million 石 (koku) to 42 million 石 (koku). The "supply" purchase volume from farmers was reduced from 30 million 石 (koku) to 26 million 石 (koku), and they were allowed to substitute it with other wheat flour, mulberry leaves, sweet potato vines, etc. However, farmers now distrust the government and are taking a wait-and-see attitude, reluctant to "supply" their crops. Therefore, the problem now is not whether there is enough to eat, but whether the farmers are willing to bring it out, because even with a poor harvest, the current level of rations can still last until this summer. In reality, there is only a shortage of food for June, July, and August. However, now, in April and May, the farmers are unwilling to trust this government and "supply" their crops. Therefore, at the end of last year, the food reserves in the six major cities nationwide were only enough for eight days in Tokyo, five days in Kyoto, and only twelve or three days in the other four major cities.</p>
<p>The Public Advocates "Flour-Based Diet"; Dandelions and Weeds Are Eaten as Food</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, the Allied countries allowed it to import a portion of food, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem. Therefore, fertilizer was converted into feed, and feed was used as food. For example, silkworm pupae left over after raising silkworms and producing silk, which were originally used as fertilizer before the war, were converted from fertilizer to feed during the war, then to industrial oil raw materials, and then to valuable raw materials for manufacturing nutritional medicines. Ordinary people could not easily obtain them, and nutritional medicines were only rationed to hospitals and the military. It is said that if one lives on a daily ration of two 合 (gō) of rice, the various nutrients lacking in the human body can be supplemented by eating ten silkworm pupae. Eating thirteen would be excessive. In addition to rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, and beans as the main foods, it has recently been discovered that twenty kinds of wild plants such as dandelions can be eaten. They are currently being collected, dried, and ground into flour to be mixed into bread. Therefore, a "flour-based diet" is now being promoted. Tree bark, mulberry leaves, radish roots, sweet potato vines, fish bones, weeds, locusts, etc., are easily swallowed and eaten once they are dried and made into flour. Therefore, Japan claims that the "era of the flour-based diet" has arrived.</p>
<p>They Only Set Fires and Didn't Kill People; Hemiplegia is Both Tragic and Comic</p>
<p>The Japanese themselves have said: "It is easy to burn wood with fire, but Japanese houses are made by sawing the wood into finer pieces, framing it more sparsely, and adding paint and paper to make it burn even more easily." The Allied forces saw clearly where its weaknesses lay and decided to adopt incendiary tactics. Each small six-pound incendiary bomb dropped required relatively little capital, but set extremely large fires. Furthermore, they only set fires and didn't kill people, which was both chaotic, pitiful, and hilariously funny.</p>
<p>Originally, the US Air Force's bombing plan for Japan was carried out in three phases: the first phase targeted military facilities and munitions factories, the second phase involved indiscriminate bombing of large, medium, and small cities, and the third phase involved the destruction of transportation infrastructure. The effect of the first phase was to reduce Japan's aircraft manufacturing capacity. When the war began in July 1937, Japan's monthly aircraft production was only 100 aircraft. By June 1945, it had gradually increased to 3,000 aircraft per month, but as a result of the US bombing of munitions factories, it suddenly decreased to 1,000 aircraft in July. Underground factories could not be rebuilt in a short time, and the air combat capability was greatly reduced. The second phase was the bombing of cities. Most of the six major cities, except Kyoto, were subjected to multiple air raids, with over 800 B-29s deployed in one night. Later, medium and small cities were not spared. A total of 100,000 tons of incendiary bombs were dropped on 66 cities across the country, destroying 42% of industrial areas. As an example, Kagoshima Prefecture, the southernmost coastal prefecture in the Pacific theater, was attacked 168 times in the 150 days from the start of the bombing until the surrender. All but five villages and cities out of the prefecture's three cities and 138 villages were attacked, showing the extent of the damage. The third phase of bombing had just begun when Japan surrendered. Presumably, the Pacific War would have followed the example of Germany, bombing the country until not a single inch of railway was passable, cutting off supplies, and making it impossible to fight before launching a landing invasion. Therefore, they initially only bombed railway bridges. At that time, the entrance to the underwater tunnel connecting Kyushu and Shimonoseki had been bombed to the point of being irreparable, and the first-line transportation had already become hemiplegic. Later, even the city streetcars were bombed, and sea mines were used for maritime blockade, sinking 500,000 tons of ships, and the supply of goods was almost completely cut off.</p>
<p>The Total Number of Houses Destroyed in Japan Reaches 2.1 Million Households</p>
<p>In terms of housing, most Japanese houses are wooden due to frequent severe earthquakes. Typhoons and floods occur frequently, and the devastation of collapses and washouts has become the greatest concern in recent years, making it impossible to live and work in peace. They could not withstand the US Air Force's incendiary bomb tactics. When a fire started, it spread for miles, and a city would be finished after just a few bombings. This time, 2.1 million homes were destroyed nationwide. After Japan surrendered, citizens returned home from evacuation in the countryside, but due to problems with timber and transportation, they could not be rebuilt and restored in a short time. Therefore, they are now living in groups in temples and schools.</p>
<p>Houses Were Demolished Automatically; Housing Panic Worsened</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 18, 1944, when the reporter got off the streetcar in front of the Mitsukoshi Department Store in Nihonbashi, the busiest district in Tokyo, he saw a large group of people rushing to buy extra editions of the newspaper. He went up to take a look and learned that it was about the first US air raid on the iron and steel plant in northern Kyushu. The area within 20 里 (li) of Yawata was full of chimneys, smoke, small iron rails, and coal. It was indeed a wartime stronghold. Therefore, the people in Japan experienced a great psychological shock, and from then on, they intensified air defense training day and night, working tirelessly on firefighting, rescue, and evacuation. Until November 24, 1944, when groups of B-29 giant aircraft flew slowly over the heads of Tokyo citizens, everyone realized that air raids could not be defended by human power, so they demolished their houses and evacuated to the countryside, or dug holes in the rubble of the burnt ruins and hid their clothes, quilts, pots, and bowls inside, living a trench life. When going out on the street, people had to wear air defense clothing, steel helmets, leggings, and first-aid kits, and would be interfered with by the police if they were missing anything. At the same time, Japan strictly controlled the people's thoughts, and the censorship of correspondence was very strict. Therefore, people would only understand how terrible the air raids were when they happened to them. Every time a place was bombed, a pre-printed notice was immediately posted on every mailbox, warning citizens that correspondence, in addition to their own safety, was prohibited from informing relatives and friends of the details of the bombing, otherwise they would be severely punished.</p>
<p>Even with "Clothing Coupons," Clothing Could Still Not Be Bought</p>
<p>Japan was originally the world's leading textile country, but its raw materials were all supplied by others. During the war, the raw cotton from India and the wool from Australia were cut off, and there were problems with the shortage of chemical fibers and rayon due to the lack of medicine production. The only thing to rely on was silk. However, due to the increase in food production, the area of mulberry trees was reduced from 500,000 町 (chō) to 200,000 町 (chō), and silk factories were also incorporated into the fourth level of industry because their machinery was transferred to munitions manufacturing. At the same time, silk products had to be given priority for parachutes and aircraft manufacturing and could not be used entirely for civilian needs. Therefore, the raw materials for fiber were certainly controlled and purchased, and textile products were also manufactured comprehensively, and the people's clothing supplies were undoubtedly subject to strict rationing. In the last two years, each adult male was rationed 50 "clothing points." When buying fiber products on the market, in addition to the price, a certain number of these "clothing points" had to be paid. For example, a pair of socks required about three points, a undershirt required about ten points, and a set of shorts and trousers required 40 points. Once these "clothing points" were used up, it was impossible to buy cloth again. But soon things got worse. Even with money and "clothing points," it was still impossible to buy clothing. Families had to have a 保甲 (bao-jia) "ration ticket," workers had to have a factory "ration ticket," and students had to have a school "ration ticket." Later, there was simply no clothing in the stores, and the allocation of black scraps of cloth for repairing umbrellas and the allocation of cotton thread for mending clothes were repeatedly delayed, leading from disappointment to despair. Therefore, paper substitutes such as paper hats, paper vests, and paper sheets came into being.</p>
<p>Ridiculously and pitifully, Japanese farmers harvested the green ears of rice and wheat crops before they were fully ripe. This was because once they ripened and the stalks turned yellow, they were afraid that they would be burned by phosphorus and sulfur bombs dropped by US aircraft. Also, because of the lack of oil fields and the disruption of supplies from the South Seas, resources were extremely scarce, so they tried to refine alcohol from sweet potato starch for use in aircraft and fuel. Therefore, at a time when food was scarce, they dug up rice fields to plant sweet potatoes, appealing to the people: "People have to eat, and airplanes have to eat too!" Therefore, even sweet potatoes became difficult to obtain for food as they were used for industrial purposes during the war. After painstaking research by various universities, more than 20 new varieties of sweet potatoes were invented, the best of which contained 24% starch. Seedlings were regularly rationed to households, and everyone had to plant and "supply" them. When houses were burned down in air raids, people were encouraged to plant sweet potatoes on the burned land, because the burned land contained potassium fertilizer, which was most suitable for planting sweet potatoes. At the same time, many of the dropped incendiary bomb shells were converted into agricultural tools. Even if there were more bombings after planting, the sweet potatoes, being underground root crops, would not be damaged. Once the surrender came, just in time for the harvest, they shifted the military use to civilian food and used the air-raid shelters as storage for the harvested goods.</p>
<p>Allied Forces Confiscate Military Clothing and Rice; Convert to Use by Japanese Civilians</p>
<p>At the same time, in the past three months, the US Sixth Army has confiscated 200,000 tons of military food and 200,000 pieces of clothing from the Japanese army and navy. These confiscated items have all been converted for use by Japanese civilians.</p>
<p>These materials include 132,000 tons of soybeans, 42,000 tons of fish and meat, and 113.3 million cans of canned vegetables. In addition, a large number of clothes have been distributed, including 4.5 million blankets, 4 million pairs of shoes, 4 million pairs of socks, 600,000 coats, 3 million sets of uniforms, and 4 million sets of underwear.</p>
<p>According to figures announced yesterday by the 11th Corps of the Eighth Army, this second list of declarations includes at least 46,000 tons of food, approximately 3 million blankets, 2 million upper garments and coats, 3 million other items of clothing, 1.5 million pairs of shoes, and some building materials and medicines urgently needed by the Japanese people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prisoners of War Serve in Beijing</h3>
<p>Under the auspices of the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the service projects of Japanese unarmed officers and soldiers are undertaken by the Japanese 40th Division, divided into five work teams, totaling 12,000 people. One of the most difficult sections of the entire project is the dredging of the Qinhuai River. Due to years of siltation, the water level is high, and after several days of heavy rain, it is almost higher than the ground in Beijing and outside the city. The riverbed has 30,000 cubic meters of mud accumulation. There are 2,770 cubic meters of garbage on the shore. To lower the water level, it is necessary to remove the mud accumulation and garbage.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Production and Construction</p>
<h3>Advocating the Knitting Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhou Keqiang</p>
<p>The knitting industry has been recorded as early as the thirteenth century in Italy and was introduced to England in the mid-fifteenth century. At that time, knitting machinery was simple and the products were rough, only hand-knitted. But because its fabrics are necessary for daily life, it was noticed by the world in the sixteenth century. At the end of the sixteenth century, William Lee, an Englishman, invented the hand-operated stocking machine with elastic needles. This great achievement laid the foundation for the knitting industry and aroused the interest of the world in studying knitting. Later, Matthew Townshend, an Englishman, invented the latch needle, and the action of the latch needle in weaving fabrics is simpler than that of the elastic needle. At this point, it promoted the fundamental reform of the knitting machine and allowed the scope of hand weaving to enter mechanization, and the knitting industry also showed a bright future. It is said above that knitted fabrics are necessary for daily life. Why are they necessary for daily life? Because knitted fabrics have their unique properties and uses: the weaving of knitted fabrics is formed by bending yarn lines and connecting them according to the direction of the warp and weft. Therefore, when the fabric is subjected to strong force, it tightens and becomes a straight line, and when the external force is removed, it returns to its original shape. The Japanese named the knitting machine "Mosaku Daijyo" (something like large, small machine) because its fabric is highly elastic. Also, because the fabric is connected by yarn lines into crooked and small curves, the structure has many holes, so the finished product is soft and loose, suitable for making underwear, gloves, socks, etc., which can absorb sweat in summer and keep warm in winter, fit the body, and give a pleasant feeling, and are clothing materials that stick to the skin. Since the eight-year war of resistance, the general public has long been ragged and tattered. If we rely on other countries to give us some rags and pants, it may not be a fundamental solution, because our country has a vast territory and a large population. If these 450 million compatriots each add a piece of clothing and pants, the total number would be alarming. Moreover, after the victory, the Japanese lost the markets for knitted fabrics in Southeast Asia, and left many knitting machines in our country. We should seize this opportunity to develop this once-in-a-lifetime good opportunity for foreign trade. Have you not seen that others are fighting each other to win the market? If we miss this good opportunity and do not seek progress, it will prove that we are doing nothing and waiting for others to invade. However, we have to say that there are certainly difficulties for us to revitalize the knitting industry. Our country has a short history of knitting and immature technology, so we must make the greatest efforts and request the government to operate with national capital, cultivate knitting technical talents, and recruit more talents to make them work with peace of mind and give full play to their abilities.</p>
<p>The author once visited the Shandai Weaving Factory in Nanlinli, Xizang Road. It is an enemy property and was taken over and resumed operation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is a small factory with complete machinery. The managers Zhu Xun, Wang Heling and nearly a hundred employees. Upon entering the factory, everything was clean and tidy. Eye-catching slogans were often guided into the workshop. The workers had no sound of talking and teasing, and only saw them focusing on their work without slackening. Therefore, on the finished product statistics table, the line of work efficiency went white. According to the workers, a meeting is held at the beginning of each week, where the employees take turns reporting current affairs news, the work that should be done this week, and talk about a passage on the fate of China. At the end of the week, each department holds a small group discussion to review the shortcomings of the work during the week and the matters that should be improved. All management can be said to be in good order. Therefore, it is very worthwhile for us to advocate the knitting industry. We hope that the government will resume the operation and takeover of various knitting factories as soon as possible, widely recruit and cultivate knitting talents, pay attention to worker education, so that the knitting industry can occupy an important position in our country's construction and enrichment.</p>
<h3>Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>The most fashionable industry of the twentieth century can be said to be the aviation industry; due to the development of aircraft, the distance of space is greatly shortened. The losses caused by time in the past are now reduced, and the difficulties felt by terrain in the past are now resolved.</p>
<p>Aviation has cast a glorious and indelible page in the history of victory in this great war. Whether on the battlefield or in the rear, it has shown excellent results. Today, with the arrival of peace, it will take on the responsibility of transportation, communication of culture, dissemination of the seeds of peace, and increasing human happiness. In terms of national defense and people's livelihood, it is a necessary condition for a modern country.</p>
<h3>The Tea Industry Before and After Victory</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Tea has always been one of our country's major exports. According to statistics from the tea industry, tea exports before the Anti-Japanese War were around 600,000 metric tons annually, recovering a considerable amount of lost wealth.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the "August 13th" Incident, tea exports suffered a severe blow. Especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the sales channels for tea completely collapsed. General tea factories closed down one after another, and tea workers either switched to small-scale trading, traveled around making a precarious living, or, lacking business acumen and unable to travel, fell into poverty and starvation. This was truly the most depressed period for the tea industry.</p>
<p>After the victory, various industries resumed operations, and tea, as one of our country's major export commodities, naturally actively prepared for recovery. However, on the one hand, due to soaring prices and financial difficulties for tea merchants, only a dozen or so were able to restore their former businesses. On the other hand, during the Anti-Japanese War, mountain farmers dug up tea plants to grow food, resulting in tea production only reaching two-tenths of pre-war levels. Restoring pre-war production levels is simply not something that can be achieved in a short period of time.</p>
<p>According to a person in the tea industry speaking to the writer: Before the war, the most famous exported teas were Keemun black tea, Wuyuan Chunmee, Pingshui, Dapeng pearl tea, as well as Hangzhou's Longjing and Shifeng teas. Taking Shanghai as an example, there were more than sixty tea factories. Each factory employed more than ten workers. The workers' wages, in addition to providing food and lodging, were about seven jiao (old currency) of silver dollars per day. Now, with the cost of living rising daily, workers' wages, in addition to food and lodging, must be at least around 1,000 legal tender. However, with this small amount, maintaining the family life of each worker is also not an easy task.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to develop the foreign trade of the tea industry, the industry hopes that the government authorities, in addition to the National Bank providing tea loans (this step has already been taken), will assist in the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Since 1941, tea exports have been interrupted, tea merchants have suffered a setback, and tea farmers have become even more impoverished, leading to a sharp decline in production. It is hoped that the government will provide relief quickly.</p>
<p>(2) Tea is one of the major export commodities. In the past, due to tea merchants adhering to outdated methods and failing to make improvements, and the government not having time to attend to this, tea exports gradually declined from the second position. In the future, both government and industry should cooperate to improve production and seek revitalization.</p>
<p>In addition, strengthening the organization of the Tea Trade Association, promoting solidarity and cooperation among industry members, and avoiding shoddy products are also several things that the tea industry should pay attention to after victory.</p>
<h3>The Work of Thinking</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>In the management of a business, the work of thinking is very important, because everything must be carefully considered before being implemented.</p>
<p>To think comprehensively, the first thing is to understand thoroughly. To understand thoroughly, one must first engage in self-cultivation, study all the knowledge required in management, and then combine it with experience. This can make the work of thinking more complete, and even if the issues resolved are not absolutely free of errors, at least many unnecessary errors can be avoided.</p>
