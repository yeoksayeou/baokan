<h3>星期論壇　國民大會有形與無形問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 金嗚盛</p>
<p>政治協商會所定憲草修改原則，關於國民大會者，計分四條如次：</p>
<p>（一）全國選民行使四權，名之曰國民大會。</p>
<p>（二）未實行德統普選制以前，總統由縣級，省級及中央議會合組選舉機關選舉之。</p>
<p>（三）總統之罷免，以選舉總統之同樣方法行使之。</p>
<p>（四）創制複次兩權之行使，另以法律規定之。</p>
<p>中央社電傳二月十五日憲草審議會第二次會議，討論國民大會問題，周炳琳孫科王寵惠曾琦諸氏主張國民大會應爲有形之組織，張君勱莫德惠羅隆基諸氏主張國民大會應爲無形之組織。羅氏謂第一條修改原則，其作用即在取消國民大會云云。所謂「取消」即變更有形之組織，而爲無形組織之意。此一問題之討論，現尚未獲得結論。</p>
<p>所謂有形之國民大會，殆指專選代表，合組織會式機關之意。所謂無形之國民大會，殆指全國公民總投票之機關，或全國普選時之選舉團體而言，相當於西洋之「Plebiscile」。五五憲草所定國民大會體制，爲有形之典型。此次修改原則所定，則爲無形之典型。惟照原則第二三兩條規定，似國民大會之選舉罷免二權，在某期限以前，乃暫由另一機關所代行。此一機關，乃由縣級省級及中央議會所合組。又修改原則第十二項關於憲法之修改，其修正案亦應交此一機關複次。故該機關又兼有票次憲法修正案之權。是項國民大會臨時代替機關，似不至有集合一地舉行會議之形式，故仍爲無形的範疇。</p>
<p>中央社繼續電傳二月十六日憲草審議會第三四次會議，討論中央政制問題時，對國民大會間題，亦一併論及。王雲五氏並提出具體主張四條；</p>
<p>（一）仍維持有形之國民大會。</p>
<p>（二）國民大會之戰務爲（甲）選舉總統，（乙）罷免總統，（丙）發動複次，但仍提付國民複次，（丁）創制立法原則，但山立法院根據其原則制定法案，提付國民決定之。（戊）政府施政方針之聽取。</p>
<p>（三）憲法施行後五年內，國民複次權，及對於國民大會創制之決定權，由全國縣議會全體議員代行之。</p>
<p>（四）國民大會每二年重選一次，每年集會一次。</p>
<p>今所當首先申論者，爲有形制與無形制之利弊問題。有形制之利，在代表集中一地，其職權之運用，比較便利，此其一。有形的組織，對於政府之監制，不至流於空洞，徒具虛名，此其二。而其弊則在國民大會君臨於五院之上，其職權縱予限制，因另無機關予以糾制之故，勢必形成太上政府，攬五權爲一權，此其一。如於代表之任期及開會之時距，予以種種限制，則政權之行使，又似有太過空盧，形回具文之弊，此其二。且代表名額，因須集體開會之故，必不容過多，此與民主原則，亦不無欠缺，此其三。代表集中一地，易受野心家之操縱與刦持，此其四。是知有形之國民大會，利少而弊多，自不如無形制爲愈。惟如逕採無形制，無論其爲人民自行政權，或由代表代行政權，因散處全國各地之故，除選舉權外，其餘各權之發動，必極端困難，以致無法遝用，有權等於無權。</p>
<p>其次當硏究者，爲四種直接民權，即政權運用之方式。大抵政權之運用，可分爲兩種方式：即聯名請求或發動之權，及全體投票表次之權。前者可稱爲「要求權」，其聯名手續比較麻煩，但性質不甚重要。因各種要求案成立之後，仍須政府接受，或人民粟次，方能確定故也。後者可稱爲「核定權」，全國定期同時投票，手續比較簡單，但性質則大爲重要。因此權爲人民之最後決定權，非惟足以判定各種要求案之當吾，且更足以解次政府間之爭端，明辨各部門之責任故也。要求權與核定權，全爲兩種不同之權力，其行使，照各國所行慣例，亦無必然的連接關係存乎其間。有僅有要求之權，類似公民之請願者，有法定必須人民票次，無待人民之要求者，又有要求案提出以後，其是否再付票次，須視其他情形以爲斷者。（其詳可參照拙著直接民權大綱一書）。故兩種權力，根本不能混爲一談。</p>
<p>本此分析，對於國民大會之設計，作者向有折衷制之主張，以諸種要求權付託於有形之國民代表會，而同時，仍將諸種核定權保留與無形之國民大會。此法兼採兩制之利，而無其弊（參照拙著五權憲政論集關係論文）。作者並曾主張在憲法頒布後十年內，由各縣市及其同等區域之議會議員，代各該地方區域內之全體公民，行使國民大會之投票權，以免事實上之困難。此與上述王雲五氏之提議，不謀而合，足徵所見略同。王氏主張之國民大會，即作者所謂國民代表會，而作者設計之國民大會，王氏則祇稱國民。至暫以縣議員代行國民票次權一點，作者與王氏意見完全相同，惟時間上稍有參差而已。</p>
<p>王氏方案，電訊所傳，語焉未詳，茲摘錄作者向所擴議全章條文於后，藉供硏討：</p>
<p>憲草第三章　國民大會及國民代表會</p>
<p>（一）國民大會以享有公民權之中華民國國民組織之。公民權之取得，依法律之規定。</p>
<p>（二）國民大會之開會，於各縣市及其同等區域內，同時分區行之。</p>
<p>（三）國民大會之議事，不經討論，以投票之方法爲之；其次議，除本憲法另有規定外，以總投票數之過半數定之。國民大會投票之程序，以法律定之。</p>
<p>（四）國民大會由國民代表會依第二十二條第一項第十一欵之規定召集之；會期每次不得過三日。</p>
<p>（五）在本憲法頒布後十年內，由各縣市及其同等區域之議會議員，代各該地方區域內之全體公民，行使國民大會之投票權。</p>
<p>在前項代行期間內，國民大會之開會，於各縣市及其同等區域之議會內行之（本條可列入附則章內）。</p>
<p>（六）國民大會之職權如左：</p>
<p>一　就國民代表會所提出之候選人名單，選舉總統，副總統，立法，司法，考試，監察各院院長（核選權）。</p>
<p>二　核定國民代表會對於總統，立法，司法，考試，監察各院院長提出之罷免案（核免權）。</p>
<p>三　核定國民代表會修改憲法之提議，及其所提出之憲法修正案（核止權及核行權）。</p>
<p>四　核定國民代表會依第二十六條第一項第六款至第八款之規定，提請解次之事項（核行權核止權及核免權）。</p>
<p>前項第四款職權，得於執行他款職權之會議，附同執行之</p>
<p>（七）國民代表會以國民代表組織之，對國民大會負其責任。國民代表名額之分配，應以人口爲比例；但代表總數，不得超過四百人。〔未完〕</p>
<h3>主席俯瞰溪口故鄉　離杭前舉行茶會執行官紳　勉吃苦耐勞完成建國使命</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕主席前日下午乘美齡號專機離杭。原擬赴奉化一行，以限於時間。不克前往，但對桑梓之關切，無時或忘，故特令駕駛員順道還至奉化上空，於空中鳥瞰別已九載之故鄉，四時四十分機抵奉化溪口，在二千尺低空飛翔，地面景物，歷歷可數，鄉民聞主席機聲，羣擁至街道昂望歡呼，主席夫婦亦頻頻在機中揮手示意，專機在蔣太夫人墓上空盤旋三週，復飛至抗戰中被敵機炸燬之武陵學校上空，低飛憑吊後，始東飛來滬。主席離杭前，並在浙省府內舉行茶會，招待士紳及各機關首長，即席致詞，略謂：中正今日與各位相見，沒有禮物增送我門的親友，只有將這一片報國愛民的赤忱，與各位父老昆弟互相勉勵，就是我們大家要以已飢己溺之心，來拯救我們同胞，來復興我們民族，要以天下國家爲己任，來確保抗戰的勝利，完成建國的使命。現在我們的抗戰是得到勝利了，但是各位必須預想到今後建國的困難，全國同胞都必須認識建國工作是一件艱鉅無比的工作，我們必須在整個國家民族的前提之下，精神比抗戰時期更要振奮，工作比抗戰時期更要努力，尤其是生活比抗戰時期更要刻苦忍痛，必須咬緊牙關，埋頭努力，如此，再過八年之後，或許我們能從殘破的舊社會之中，建立起一個新的國家，乃能自由獨立，生存於今日的世界。總之，我們這一輩子的同胞，必須知道我們旣然遭逢了這個時代，吃苦耐勞，乃是我們的本分，不必再想我們的生活有什麼優裕的享受，我們的工作待遇有什麽更好的奢望，我們這一代的人，必須下定次心，爲了完成艱鉅的建國工作，在這三十年內，必須時刻準備過最痛苦的生活，担任最煩劇的工作，才能使得我們子孫免於奴隸牛馬的慘境。臥薪嚐胆的故事，於令全國的同胞家喩戶曉，而且我們抗戰的勝利都是憑藉於這個傳統精神爲基礎的，可是大家要知道這個臥薪嚐胆的越王勾踐，就是我們浙江的先哲，我希望浙江以及我們全國同胞，都不忘我們先哲這種堅苦卓絕，雪恥圖强的精神，共同一致，苦心戳力，百折不回，堅忍不拔的，來建設我們中國，成爲一個富强康樂的現代國家，實現我們總理所昭垂偉大的三民主義，庶不愧爲民族主義發祥地的浙江，這是中正所貢獻於我們全浙同胞的一點，亦是對我全浙同胞惟一的期望。</p>

<h3>蒙恥而死結束一生　山下奉文昨絞決</h3>
<p>臨刑前猶謂在上帝前可告無愧</p>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺二十三日電〕曾掃蕩馬來半島奪取新加坡赫赫一時之前菲律濱日軍司令山下奉文大將，已於今日以縱容部下殘殺美菲軍民等罪，在洛斯彭諾斯執行紋刑，紋刑臺佈置於四十方呎之區域內，四週圍以綠色鐵絲網。山下受刑時，被剝去軍服及一切表示其爲軍人之符號。此「馬來之虎」遂於蒙恥中結束其一生。臨死前，除祝頌日皇萬歲，及永世昌隆外，並希望日本獲得和平。當山下押赴校首臺時，由翻譯一人及僧侶一人同行，山下態度始終保持鎭靜，在絞次前數小時，渠會對其翻譯談稱：「余執行菲島日軍最高司令之職責，已竭其所能，以管束余之軍隊，正如余曾對馬尼刺最高法院所言，余對於約束部下已盡最大努力，余今雖死，在上帝前可告無愧。但君如謂全無力指揮日軍，則余欲無言，良以余之個性如是也。我國戰犯將在馬尼刺最高法院中開審，希望藉汝之仁受與正義，余之冤屈得以伸雪。余承認美國軍事人員對余寬大利善，余雖死將永不忘懷，余對余之行刑官毫無怨言，願上帝祝福彼等。」山下奉文之執行較刑，爲戰時結束以來最嚴守之秘密，攝影記者均不准接近刑場，同時菲律濱拘留所均有警衛駐守。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼拉廿三日電〕山下奉文已於今晨三時零二分在此間執行絞刑，此爲聯合團軍事法庭以放　部下殘殺等罪判處死刑後被執行之日軍主要戰爭犯第一人。隨山下同赴絞黨者尚有前菲律濱日本特務隊隊長太田·及一日本翻譯，二人亦以虐殺菲律濱平民罪判處死刑。太田係於晨三時四十一分紋斃，臨死態度亦鎭定，翻譯於四時十七分畢命，死時神色慌張。</p>

<h3>劉航琛來滬主持抑平糧價　定標本兼治辦法</h3>
<p>官商合作　候聽取糧商意見　再辦理貸款事宜</p>
<p>（本報訊）糧食部政務次長劉航琛氏，前日偕本市糧政特派員楊錫志氏抵滬，當於昨晨召集糧商兩公會理監事會議，即席聽取各糧商意見，對本市整個糧食問題，亦有週詳之討論。劉次長認爲當前糧政施策，不脫三大原則：即（一）糧食有無問題，（二）糧食多少問題，（三）糧食貴賤問題。據楊特派員語記者；江浙產米區去秋豐收，產量　當，而且前拋賣者，不及產量百分之三十。至本市糧食之存底，則遠較去年九月初時，增加六倍至八倍之多，故糧商有無問題，業已解次。故進一步之計　，即在求其數量再行增多，則糧價自賤。</p>
<p>決定辦法多則</p>
<p>昨日會議，決定治本治標辦法多則，治本方面，（一）在會同地方政府金融機關等，辦理糧商貸欵。　函請各國營民營交通機構，優待糧商，給予優先權，俾减低採購成本。（三）加强糧商公會之組織，以杜絕非業中人涉足糧業。治標方面（一）擬請中央與地方政府，對囤積操縱糧食之徒，速依法令，採取有效措置。（二）本市公司工廠社團等，望能集團赴產區購辦米糧，勿在市區大量購進。（三）本市市民，應安心鎭靜，勿因米漲，而羣起競購。（四）產區與銷貨區之間，需設置一確切之通訊，俾不致因報道之不確，而使各地糧價混亂。（五）擬請輿論界一致宣傳，力促投機家勿以糧食爲其投機買賣之標的。楊特派員旋復關明糧政處拋售米糧之目的，一在布實糧源，二在調節民食，拋售辦法，則係通過豆米業公會之機機，拋售予各米號。故並非爲發賣平價米，或普遍分配。</p>
<p>官商合作辦法</p>
<p>該會昨日結論，即爲政府須與糧商合作。合作辦法，首由政府充份培植糧商力量，舉辦糧商購米貸款，俾便融通糧商資金，使一面能在市塲拋售米糧，一而仍有充份資金在產區機購。故當局卞面亟望糧商趕速加强組織，使政府能即着手辦理貸款事宜。至貸款數額及方案，日內當有具體規定。</p>
<p>又訊，昨晨會議時，各理監事均誠懇表示，願與政府密切合作，以抑平糧價，劉次長當即限令各理監事於今午十二時至下午三時內，提出糧商所要求之具體合作辦法，繼續舉行會議，決定確切辦法及貸欵數字。又本市米價漸見下疲，昨降千餘元，白粳跌至二萬八千元。</p>

<p>一再商討尙無結果</p>
<p>交通部電信局及國際電台怠工風潮，迄至昨夜仍未平息。確息二十二日下午四時，各職工曾派六代表謁見局長，向局方綱續要求，延至九時始散。當經局方議定三項辦法：（一）允許提高待遇（二）准各級一律借給五萬元；（三）限當晚全體復工。各代表當即表示接受，俟返局轉達意見後，同人認爲不滿，拒絕接受，繼續怠工。昨晨八時，由各部負責人，招集開會討論表次，請求局方將同人所提一二項要求歸納一項，不分職別，一律借支八萬元。生活津須照上海生活指數，能負祖六口之家爲度，底薪邀從部令規定。下午四時，再派代表十六人，向局方商討，局方除堅持原議外，只允許酌撥福利基金，趕辦職工福利會。昨晚職工曾舉行大會，決定仍繼續怠工。並悉郁局長因處理此問題極感棘手，已向總局提出辭呈。</p>

<h3>漢口日軍慘殺美飛行員案　憲兵隊情報處代處長　供述勒死時情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕漢口殺害美飛行員一案，美軍事法庭昨日上午繼續提審日第卅四師團新聞組上等兵西川莊次。西川否認參加漢口三美飛行員游街，僅在路上見到，但曾見三人被絞死，並在絞前見其中有一人由地上站起，故將其推倒。又謂：吾奉命守衛火葬場監視戰俘，以免彼等脫逃。後又帮同抬已死之一美飛行員之腿至火葬處。西川矢口稱不知由誰執行絞死，因時在夜間，僅知泰重治軍曹（此人失踪）令人將繩取來，後又向泉毅一中尉報告「三戰俘已被火葬」。</p>
<p>繼審漢口日憲兵隊情報處代理處長曹長增井莊次。增井供稱：一九四四年十二月十六日晨接昭部中估命令，謂：「今日獲師團命令，中國人方面將舉行三美飛行員遊街，你與其他三憲兵前去負責維持秩序。」令其前往獄中押出三人，將彼等綑綁。並叙述遊行排列情形，中國軍警多於日兵，但因人數不足，致暴動羣衆毆打三美飛行員時無法抵抗。又供，曾協助紋死二美飛行員，並描述當時情形。原告辯護人韋斯脫中校問其是否感覺抱歉及憐惘此被殺害之三人。增井謂其本人感覺憐惘，但當時無法顧到，因係奉命所爲，不得反抗。</p>

<p>電影與劇劇</p>
<h3>建設劇劇文化〔下〕</h3>
<p>— 唐紹華</p>
<p>在孔子之前，演劇的事業已經是崎形的發展，和現在一樣，演劇者必須依附于唐明皇一類的人們才能够生存，人們視演劇者爲取樂的工具，所以稍稍知道自愛自尊，不願自淪爲玩具的人，都在竭力避免與戲劇接近，有時甚至把演劇的行爲列入禁令。</p>
<p>然而禁止演劇，未必就是够有益于世通人心，到孔子的時代，世這人心，已經如江河日下，於是，他自己本于硏究戲劇藝術的心得，大聲疾呼，敎弟子們要用「戲劇救世」。戲劇如何救世？當然，這裏面有他強有力的理諭根據，所以才敢於提倡這個「聖王之所非」的空前的主張。（見荀子禮樂篇）</p>
<p>孔子爲要實行自己的主張，第一便是確定戲劇的價値。他堅決地主張戲劇不是供人取樂的玩具，而長敎育大衆的工具。演劇的行爲，便是敎育的行爲，演劇者便是敎育者。但演劇者如何可以成爲敎育者呢？因此，第二點，他便注意到要提高戲劇的價値，便不能不同時提高演劇者的社會地位。孔子生平喜歡與演劇者來往，講論劇藝，他的確不像當時一般喜歡戲子而看不起戲子的智識階級。他到處替戲劇工作者鼓吹，極力說道這一門行業的重要。然而到了後來，也自已又發覺單是這樣鼓吹，仍然無濟於事，其中必定還有原故。也跑過幾個國家之後，才又發明了一種辦法，於是第三點，他發現要提高戲子的社會地位，還必要有一種先行的工作，這工作便是審查劇本。於是，孔子乃有刪詩正樂的事，而審查劇本的內容，刪去有損演劇者尊嚴的歌詞和動作。</p>
<p>然而，他有德無位，當時不過從私人的資格替社會審查劇本，因此效力很微。微到僅能影饗自己的學生。據他學生的筆記上說，孔子的審查戲劇標準—亦即是他對於戲劇的要求，只不過是「使其聲足以樂而不淫，使其文足以論而不息，使其曲直而節奏足以感動人之善心」便罷了。（見記樂記禮）</p>
<p>這樣嚴正的要求，自然是很難計好的，第一，從戲劇中抽出了可以取樂（低級地）的成分，便惹起唐明皇的不高興。（當時的唐明皇應以晉景公魏文侯一類的人爲代表，餘可類推。）第二，依賴唐明皇一類人爲其主顯以維持生活的戲子，一想到唐明皇之會不高興便知道立刻會影響自己的生存，因而也不滿意孔子的辦法了。孔子爲着救世而想到戲劇敎育，爲戲劇敎育而想到提高演劇者的地位，爲要提高演劇者的地位而實行劇本審查。這樣專心一致地提倡戲劇運動，然而結果只爲一般弟子所知道，而世之演劇者都不够瞭解他，反而只知道崇奉唐明皇。有唐明皇便有戲子，唐明皇永遠在領導着戲子，戲子便永遠是戲子，戲子便永遠也不能成爲可以負担敎育任務的演劇工作者。</p>
<p>目前提到戲劇文化的建設，可以循由的途徑，似乎也不外這數端。要提高戲劇的功能，同時必定要提高演劇者的地位，要提高演劇者的地位，又似乎不能不注重劇本的內容，以及提高演員修養的水準。一句話，就是要把戲劇和戲劇工作者，（再不能是戲子）整個地由娛樂的領域搬到敎育的領域！</p>
<h3>琵琶記在美上演</h3>
<p>— 影呆譯</p>
<p>一齣中國戲劇「琵瑟記」在波士頓上演，根據中國古典，由法語譯成美國語，由雪尼霍華及威爾歐文任編劇之職，依照東方的觀念，攙雜西方的思想。此劇的上演，唯一目的完全在消除東西人士的隔膜。由萊蒙斯各脫譜曲，斐那海茵作詩，葉契尼茂拉指揮歌唱，愛德門瓊斯服裝及置景。所有人負全爲美國藝術名流。</p>
<p>演出結果，非常圓滿，劇情半帶曲折，半帶詩劇，由百老匯名伶傑爾勃與蘇麗文担任男女主角。他們的演技一舉一動都恰到好處。歌唱部分更見悅耳。全劇的演出帶有不少幽默情調，演出的方式，完全照中國色彩，而適合於時間及空間。觀衆到了末後幾忘却了自己爲西方人，而充滿着東方的心理了。</p>
<p>故事很簡單，描寫一個姓蔡的靑年學者，由於父命，進京去求取官爵。但他心理並不願意，祗因父命難違才勉强離別愛妻，前往京都。升官之後，帝命娶一王室之女爲妻，實際上他在京師，不實成了罪犯，屢次想逃脫，卒爲他的岳父所阻，不得如願。他的父母在　荒之年先後逝世，他的妻子萬里尋夫，找到了他，由於後妻的玉成，重新團圓。</p>
<p>全劇所有角色，個性方面，那靑年學者畜有大志，可惜無人帮助。父親有些專制，母親嘗盡苦楚。前妻是聽天由命的人，後妻爲自我犧牲及謙讓的女人。斯各脫使劇情充分帶有中國彩色，而他所譜歌曲，偶然反映出喜劇情調。最大的成功，在於服裝及佈景。演出的第一夜，劇塲來個滿座，觀衆散出以後，每個都獲一深刻印象，並不住地贊美。</p>
<p>劇評</p>
<h3>二度蜜月</h3>
<p>— 陳士謙</p>
<p>「二度蜜月」是劇作家兼能演戲盛譽倫敦紐的的諾耳春華特的第十六部創作，原名「私生活」，經李樸的改編，加了一景，添了幾個人物，恐怕是屈就中國人的口胃，及應時之故，所以就改爲「二度蜜月」，倒也很合劇情</p>
<p>雖然很少情節，少有動作，但是內容及劇情很豐富，導演並不算壞，加之個個演員分任「角色」，可謂稱「職」，「二度蜜月」的演出，不太失望。</p>
<p>羅蘭的潘愛美，說白淸晰，美麗的身段，有着天才的表情，給觀衆是够有吸引力的。陳娟娟的眼圈圈化裝得太黑了，（是不是我坐在第二排之故？）這樣影響了她「原本」的美麗，値得改正。可是在香港度蜜月的時候，夫婦吵嘴，丈夫動起武來，在花前月下，柔情蜜意當中，立刻要她裝「哭相」，倒很困難，而她很自然。</p>
<p>張明强的喬奇，很成功，表情，語言，動作，意態，巧到好處；固然導演要緊，演員他自已的智慧，實在太「要緊」了。他的「噱頭」，「穿揷」，多了點，但並不俗膩，沒有迎合低級興趣的缺點。致於潘玉安的白穆，因爲劇情內是這樣的一個「特性」，無可厚非，但他的揹詞，尚有不無吹毛求疵之處。</p>
<p>其實，依照諾耳春華特的原作，已够緊凑，够有「意味」的了，何苦要加入朱太太與朱先生進去呢！要這種「噱頭」幹嗎！因爲加入朱先生，適是「畫蛇」而添「足」，難怪胡小峯（黃凱？）要以「小丑」動作出來了，這種Farce要它何用？</p>
<p>其餘，燈光，道具，倒還可以。</p>
<p>我看後覺得，這隻「戲」，也還値得介紹，「奇巧」的婚姻。現社會未嘗沒有，不僅西洋；諾耳春華特更在上海華懋飯店寫此劇本，東方其實也有這「婚變」呢！</p>
<p>影評</p>
<h3>蘇軍血戰記</h3>
<p>— 巴黎·金門上映</p>
<p>在這次戰爭中，各國都曾着力地攝製了許多宣傳性的戰爭影片，然而，當戰爭過去之後，只有少數道一類影片能保留它的價値。這是因爲道一部份的影片，視野寬廣，不但表現某時某地發生的一件特殊事項，而顯示出那個時代在人類中引起的普遍現象；感情充沛，不但是透露中作老的感情，就是故事中每一個人物的性格，對於外面發生的事件在他或她身上所生的感情，都達到了逼眞合理的地步，同時在技巧上，無論在編劇，導演，攝影，音樂，以及表演各方面，和諧地發揮到項點，常觀衆已與攝片時代脫節之後，在他們的內心已經沒有當時的潮浪，幫助作品來搖撼觀衆的感情，這些影片還能够主持觀衆的感情。「蘇軍血戰記」就是屬於這一類的影片。</p>
<p>導演處理這張片子，一開始就吸引住了觀衆緊緊地抓住他們，絕不給予任何一個多餘的過塲鏡頭，讓觀衆的意志，乘機外馳，直到銀幕上放出end的信號。整部影片的氣氛可以分成三個階段；首先在蘇德未宣戰以前（其實是不宣而戰之前），是極力地在渲染着和平與快樂。從老農夫卡普來村訪古林醫生起，一直到村民游藝晚會，這種由生活的美滿與和平中所產生的愉快的情緒，直綫式的上升到頂點，再到徒步旅行這種情緒尚未斷絕，從此德軍不宣而戰急轉入憤恨的配釀中，然而這階段還只是一種敢怒而不改言的憤恨，到這種憤恨爆發爲英勇的戰鬥之前，只是在加濃着壓抑的成份。同時在做爲下面英勇戰績的成功之導線，的爲達敏等五人護送槍械一路上的戰鬥，最後就是北極星村的光復，這是整個故事中的高潮，然而也是尾聲，就整個故事這樣完了。</p>
<p>在這個故事之中，主角，除了了各人的戲有多少之外，並不見個人，而是一羣人，因之在這影片之中，雖然名角如林，可是都有發揮的餘地，不像一些明星集錦片，只讓你看到明星而看不到戲中的角色。華德赫斯頓扮演的古林醫生與同樣爲醫生的德軍領袖哈頓上校（馮史多漢飾演）是一個凸出的對照，代表被侵略者及侵略者兩面，在最後古林槍殺哈頓上校的時候會給予一種滿足的感覺，茀萊格蘭與安妮斐絲德分飾一對年靑的情侶達敏與瑪麗娜，深深地刻劃出靑年人戀愛與犧牲之間的矛盾。然而我個人方面最喜歡的是金蕙淑扮演的鄉下姑娘克拉蒂亞，多話，怯懦去，臨上戰塲，害怕得流出眼淚，喃喃默禱要神保佑，然而，畢竟她參加了戰鬥而成仁了，導演並沒有把她造成天然的英雄，但，最怯懦的人都能變成了英雄，才是眞正地代表了這個時代。</p>
<p>更値得稱道的是這個片子的攝影與音樂，攝影師是我中國在好萊塢的唯一大攝影師，黃示霑他的造詣即在好萊塢也是數一數二的，音樂一項在我國電影事業中，是最不够的，然而看「蘇軍血戰記」就可知音樂對於氣氛的製造上盡了多大的助力。前半部有好幾個蘇聯民歌，都極優美動人。</p>
<p>這影片是　萊塢出品的蘇聯民衆抗戰史詩，以政見如此不同兩個國家，美國竟能爲蘇聯攝製這樣一部作品，眞足以顯示民主國家的偉大處，美國在電影上也盡到了同盟的責任。</p>
<h3>觀影者的話</h3>
<p>— 霍克</p>
<p>電影聞映前，當演奏國歌及領袖肖像時，屢見觀衆有不自覺的錯誤行動，亟宜糾正。的舉如下：。</p>
<p>（一）演奏國歌時，觀衆起立遲緩，而未待全曲奏畢，即於最後一音節時，已紛紛就坐，且態度毫不嚴肅，回頭張望不已，此其一。</p>
<p>（二）尋求座位或剛入塲內而聞國歌聲者，理應立停於原處，並面向銀幕，待國歌奏畢後再行覓座。今則不然，我行我素，視國歌若不聞，此種情形竟甚多，此其二。</p>
<p>（三）銀幕上出映　國父或蔣主席肖像時，應靜默敬重注視，不得鼓掌或歡呼。要知演奏國歌時最爲莊嚴，應保恃肅靜，此時鼓掌，非但有失尊重領袖之本意，而且侮辱整個國家之代表—國歌—莫此爲甚。此事筆者已遭過多次，甚感不快，此其三。</p>
<p>以上數點，最爲普通，看似簡單，其實意義非常重大，蓋電影院內最爲複雜，各國人士俱備，略一疏忽，不免貽笑大方，有失國體之尊嚴。</p>
<p>至於各影院內嘈雜喧嘩等，與以前大不相同，因不在本文範圍內，故不論，希望戲院常局注意改進。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders Responsible Authorities to Stabilize Finances and Suppress Prices; Flew Back to the Capital by Special Plane This Morning with His Wife</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Chairman Chiang is greatly concerned about the drastic fluctuations in commodity prices and the chaotic situation in the financial market in this city. He flew to Shanghai again the day before yesterday and yesterday summoned the responsible persons of various banks and financial institutions, instructing them on measures to stabilize finances and suppress commodity prices, and ordered the responsible persons to quickly bring the financial and commodity prices of this city back to normal.</p>
<p>The special plane "Meiling" landed at Longhua Airport at 6:05 p.m. last night. The Chairman and his wife slowly disembarked from the plane in the dim twilight, shook hands and chatted briefly with General Wedemeyer, who was waiting at the side of the plane, and nodded with a smile to Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison Li Jilan, and other welcomers before getting into a car and returning directly to the official residence on Jia'er Road to rest. Accompanying the Chairman and his wife were Director Yu Jishi, Chen Xizeng, Director Li Tiehan, Secretary Shen Changhuan, Gao Shengfen, Adjutant Feng Shengfa, Shi Juemin, Group Leader Zhu Peiji, Military Attache Wu Wenzhi, and others.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. yesterday, the Chairman received General Wedemeyer at the official residence and reportedly had a long conversation about military issues. At 3 p.m., he summoned Mayor Qian, Central Bank Deputy Governor Chen Xing, Director of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office Peng Xuepei, Director of the Finance Bureau Pu Zhengdong, and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian to hear about the fluctuations in financial and commodity prices in this city and gave instructions on everything. At 3:45 p.m., he summoned Song Hanzhang, manager of the Bank of China, Zhao Dihua, manager of the Bank of Communications, Zhu Runsheng, assistant manager of the Farmers Bank, and Shen Xirui, deputy director of the Central Trust Bureau, to discuss commodity price issues. At 4 p.m., he summoned Li Shouyong, director of the Shanghai Provisional University Preparatory Class, Wu Shaoshu, chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gu Yuxiu, director of the Education Bureau. At 5 p.m., he received Mike McLeen, manager of the Associated Press, Mike McCarlhue, chief editor of the Washington Star, and Zhang Tede, publisher of the Los Angeles Daily. It is reported that the Chairman gave a brief talk to the foreign journalists. At 6 p.m., the Chairman summoned Du Yuesheng, Gong Xiaolai, and Xu Jichang again for a thorough discussion on the suppression of commodity prices in Shanghai and gave instructions on various major measures to stabilize finances and commodity prices. The Chairman, needing to return to Chongqing urgently, will leave Shanghai this morning. It is reported that General Wedemeyer specially lent his special plane for the Chairman and his wife to ride, as Wedemeyer's special plane flies extremely fast, taking only about three hours from Shanghai to Chongqing, which is almost two hours faster than the "Meiling" special plane.</p>
<h3>Students in Beibei District Continue to March; Go to the National Government in Groups to Petition; Demand that the Soviet Union Fulfill the Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] The faculty, staff, and students of Fudan University, National Physical Education College, Lixin Accounting School, National Drama College, Jiangsu Medical College, and the Affiliated Middle School of Central University, and the Shanghai Medical College Physician Training Class in Beibei District, after the Northeast Incident, their sentiments are extremely indignant. Originally, they planned to respond to the student parade and demonstration in the Shapingba and Ciqikou area. However, due to limited transportation, they walked a long distance and only arrived in Shapingba at about 7 p.m. last night, spending the night in Central University and Chongqing University. At 6 a.m. this morning, they came to Chongqing from Shapingba. The entire group of more than 8,000 people marched in a vast formation with excellent order, shouting slogans along the way. Onlookers were numerous, and they enthusiastically applauded and responded to this great procession. At 11 a.m., the large group went from Niujiaotuo to Guofu Road to petition the National Government. After Director Wu Wen received them on behalf of the government and talked with them, they returned to Zhong'er Road, Lianglukou, Douyou Street, Xiaoshizi Linsen Road, and the South District Road, and then returned to Lianglukou. When passing the Political Participation Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they also separated, with one or two students and one professor elected by each school forming a presidium, which took turns electing representatives to petition, requesting the government to negotiate with the Soviet Union, earnestly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty, immediately withdraw troops, and not make further concessions to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] Most of the schools in Shapingba and Ciqikou, such as Central University and Chongqing University, have been suspended for four days. It is reported that the marching students in various schools are expected to resume classes next Monday after resting for one or two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Students in Chengdu held meetings several times today to plan for a demonstration tomorrow on the liberation of the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd] Students from dozens of schools, including Central University, held a grand parade to ensure the Northeast, which was well-organized and impassioned.</p>
<h3>Wu Dingchang Responds to Students Petitioning for Crude Oil; There Are No Secret Negotiations Between China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The Government Decides to Thoroughly Investigate the Zhang Xinfu Tragedy</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] National Government Official Wu Dingchang received representatives of the petitioning students today and spoke to the students. Wu first said: "Yesterday, your patriotic march has won the admiration and sympathy of the general public, and I feel the same way. As soon as the Chairman returns to Chongqing, I will forward your opinions. I believe the Chairman will also be moved. Recently, schools in various parts of the country, such as Beijing and Shanghai, have had similar marches, which shows the patriotic enthusiasm of students across the country, which is a cause for celebration for the country. The Northeast is the Northeast of the Chinese people. Since the 'July 7th' all-out war of resistance, we have spared no sacrifice, and the purpose is to recover the Northeast, the lifeline of China. Now that the war of resistance has ended victoriously, the National Government is determined to recover sovereignty over the Northeast. I hope that you will not forget nation-building while studying, and not forget studying while building the nation. If the country has talent, the country will be saved, and there is no need for you to come here to petition." The marching members then raised questions, requesting answers: (1) What is the progress of the Sino-Soviet negotiations? Answer: There is no secret diplomacy between China and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship has been announced, and other negotiations will be disclosed when the time comes. (2) Besides the Yalta secret conference, are there any other secret agreements? Answer: China did not participate in the Yalta secret conference and naturally knows nothing about it. Any agreement without China's participation will not be binding on China. The government will thoroughly investigate the truth of the Zhang Xinfu tragedy. After Wu finished speaking, he walked to the steps, shook hands with the leading teachers and students of various schools, and expressed his condolences.</p>
<h3>The Political Participation Council Also Has Eight Resolutions on the Northeast</h3>
<p>The presidium of the congress then went to the National Political Participation Council to petition. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Council, and Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General, received them. Secretary-General Shao addressed them, expressing his admiration for the patriotic enthusiasm of the representatives and said: "The Political Participation Council is also very concerned about the Northeast issue. The resident committee meeting of the day before yesterday had eight resolutions, which can be said to be largely the same as the hopes and goals of the representatives. All the requests will be conveyed to the participating council members." Shao said in his personal opinion: "Your motives are noble, and your purpose is to help and support the government, but you must pay attention not to increase the government's difficulties, love the country, and promote the country's true interests." They finally expressed their willingness to respect Mr. Shao's advice as an elder, but hoped that Shao would convey their demands. Many of the students who walked to petition had hoarse voices. This kind of patriotic enthusiasm gave the citizens of the capital a great feeling. Tonight, they will rest in the Qiujing Middle School in this city, and tomorrow they will take a boat back to school.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Arrests Speculators</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 23rd] Grain prices in Wuhan continue to soar. Yesterday, the price of medium-quality rice exceeded 25,000 yuan per picul, and citizens feel deeply threatened. According to Special Commissioner Shen of the Ministry of Food, the source of food here is becoming smoother day by day, and the continued rise in grain prices is due to the manipulation and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants, who will be investigated and dealt with according to the law. Also, it is raining continuously today, which farmers are happy about, and rice prices may stabilize.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 23rd] After General Li Zongren, director of the Peiping Garrison Headquarters, announced that he would ban all trading in the city if necessary, police here suddenly arrested many speculators yesterday. They were all tied up with their hands behind their backs on the street and taken away one by one. This arrest action was mainly led by the municipal government. The municipal government also stipulated that when the price of gold reaches 200,000 yuan, all trading will be prohibited. This measure is to suppress the prices of all food and daily necessities. The municipal government authorities promised to release a large amount of food stored in Japanese warehouses at low prices.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Students in Shanghai Marched in the Rain Yesterday; Surrounded the Soviet Consulate and Shouted Slogans in Demonstration</h3>
<p>[This City News] Shanghai students, in order to demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast and oppose the special status of the Northeast, specially established a rights protection movement assembly. Yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, and while the Soviet Consulate General was holding a cocktail party to entertain Chinese and foreign military and political leaders, unexpectedly, at about 11 a.m., more than 4,000 students marched in formation from the Bund Park, surrounding the consulate and shouting impassioned slogans in demonstration. These included "Demand that the Soviet Union respect the spirit of the treaty," "Immediately withdraw Soviet troops from the Northeast," "Defend sovereignty over the Northeast," "We demand complete reception of the Northeast," "For the sake of complete sovereignty, we will not hesitate to sacrifice," "Will not accept the disguised Twenty-One Demands—Four Demands," "Down with any party that sells out the motherland," "Territorial integrity, sovereignty integrity," "Long live Chairman Chiang," "Long live the Republic of China," and they sang "March of the Volunteers" and the "Three Songs of the Exiles" in unison. The singing was tragic and touching, and the cocktail party inside the consulate continued as usual with clinking glasses. Later, student representative Feng Zhizheng stood on the wall and gave a public speech. Chief Zhu of the opening cloth group represented the reception. The student representatives presented two requests: (1) Please forward to the central government that the municipal government should deal with the Soviet negotiations with a tough attitude. (2) Regarding the Zhang Xinfu murder incident of our country's engineer, seek a thorough investigation by the central government. Chief Zhu then stated: "Mayor Qian happened to have important business and could not receive you in person, instructing me to represent him. He is greatly comforted by your enthusiasm for national affairs. I will report the matters you raised to the mayor and forward them to the central government. The mayor instructed me to ask you to convey to all the students to go back to school and study peacefully, and the representatives then resigned and left. Yesterday, a total of 76 units, including major middle schools such as St. John's, Soochow, University of Shanghai, Fu Jen, Aurora, Great China, Kwong Wah, Yuying, and Minli, participated. The front of the procession was led by a huge national flag, and the steps and actions were orderly. There were also patrol groups on bicycles to maintain order, so from beginning to end, no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Memorial for Zhang Xinfu</h3>
<p>Starting tomorrow, students throughout the city will strike to express their grief and anger at the situation in the Northeast and will hold a memorial service for Zhang Xinfu and other eight martyrs at Aurora University at 10 a.m. on the 26th.

<h3>The KMT and the CCP Reach Final Agreement on Military Reorganization; The Records of the Three-Man Group Will Be Announced Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] After many days of efforts, the Military Three-Man Group Conference reached a final agreement in the meeting from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. yesterday. Regarding the reorganization of the CCP army and the national army, all the matters to be resolved have reached the purpose of the agreement, except for unexpected events. The complete records of this meeting will be announced within one or two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Zhou Enlai declared: "The Military Group Conference reached a final agreement when it held its sixth meeting tonight, deciding on the reorganization and merger of the KMT and CCP armies." Zhou said that the details of the agreement will be announced within two or three days. Although there is no formal communique yet, authoritative sources claim that the first step in the military reorganization work is to reduce the national army to 90 divisions and the communist army to 20 divisions. The remaining agenda is to reorganize the equipment of the troops so that each division can have an average of excellent equipment, redeploy the divisions' garrison areas so that the garrison boundaries of the KMT and CCP armies are abolished, re-educate the soldiers so that all troops become national rather than partisan armies, provide vocational training for the officers and soldiers of the reorganization, and the local militia organizations can only use rifles and small weapons, and only the regular army can have heavy weapons such as artillery.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 23rd] Zhou Enlai revealed: "The Military Three-Man Group Committee, designated by the Political Consultative Conference to discuss the merger of the Chinese army, has reached an agreement, and the agreed items are as follows: (1) All troops are under the command of the Ministry of National Defense, and the minister of the ministry does not necessarily have to be a military officer. (2) Troops are strictly prohibited from interfering in political events. (3) Military officers may not hold concurrent civil servant positions. (4) The conscription system will be reformed. (5) After the communist army is reduced to 20 divisions and the national army is reduced to 90 divisions, the national army should be reorganized and merged into 50 to 60 divisions."</p>

<h3>WEEKLY FORUM: THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE PROBLEMS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (PART 1)</h3>
<p>— Jin Wusheng</p>
<p>The principles for amending the draft constitution, as determined by the Political Consultative Conference, regarding the National Assembly, are divided into four articles as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All national voters shall exercise four powers, which shall be called the National Assembly.</p>
<p>(2) Before the implementation of a direct popular election system for the president, the president shall be elected by an electoral body jointly composed of county-level, provincial-level, and central assemblies.</p>
<p>(3) The recall of the president shall be exercised in the same manner as the election of the president.</p>
<p>(4) The exercise of the powers of initiative and referendum shall be regulated by separate laws.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from February 15th regarding the second meeting of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee stated that in the discussion of the National Assembly issue, Zhou Binglin, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, and Zeng Qi advocated that the National Assembly should be a tangible organization, while Zhang Junmai, Mo Dehui, and Luo Longji advocated that the National Assembly should be an intangible organization. Luo stated that the function of the first article of the amendment principles was to abolish the National Assembly. The so-called "abolition" means changing the tangible organization into an intangible one. The discussion of this issue has not yet reached a conclusion.</p>
<p>The so-called tangible National Assembly probably refers to the selection of representatives and the establishment of an organizational-style institution. The so-called intangible National Assembly probably refers to a general referendum of all citizens, or an electoral body during a national general election, equivalent to the Western "Plebiscile." The National Assembly system defined in the May 5th Draft Constitution is a typical tangible one. The principles defined in this amendment are a typical intangible one. However, according to articles two and three of the principles, it appears that the powers of election and recall of the National Assembly will be temporarily exercised by another institution before a certain period. This institution is jointly composed of county-level, provincial-level, and central assemblies. Furthermore, according to the twelfth item of the amendment principles regarding the amendment of the constitution, the amendment proposal should also be submitted to this institution for a second vote. Therefore, this institution also has the power to vote on constitutional amendments. This temporary substitute institution for the National Assembly does not appear to have a formal meeting in one location, so it still falls within the scope of intangible.</p>
<p>A continued Central News Agency dispatch from February 16th regarding the third and fourth meetings of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee stated that the National Assembly issue was also discussed when discussing the central political system. Wang Yunwu also proposed four specific proposals:</p>
<p>(1) Maintain the tangible National Assembly.</p>
<p>(2) The duties of the National Assembly are: (A) electing the president, (B) recalling the president, (C) initiating referendums, but still submitting them to a national referendum, (D) creating legislative principles, but the Legislative Yuan shall formulate bills based on these principles and submit them to the people for decision, (E) listening to the government's policy guidelines.</p>
<p>(3) Within five years after the implementation of the constitution, the power of national referendum and the power to decide on the National Assembly's initiatives shall be exercised by all members of the national county assemblies.</p>
<p>(4) The National Assembly shall be re-elected every two years and meet once a year.</p>
<p>The first thing that should be discussed now is the advantages and disadvantages of the tangible and intangible systems. The advantage of the tangible system is that representatives are concentrated in one place, and the exercise of their powers is relatively convenient, this is one. A tangible organization's supervision of the government will not become hollow and merely symbolic, this is two. However, its disadvantage is that the National Assembly reigns above the five Yuans. Even if its powers are restricted, there is no other institution to correct it, so it is bound to form a supreme government, consolidating the five powers into one power, this is one. If various restrictions are placed on the term of office and the time interval of the representatives, the exercise of political power will seem overly empty and formalistic, this is two. Furthermore, the number of representatives must not be too large because they must meet collectively, which is not without shortcomings compared to the principles of democracy, this is three. Representatives concentrated in one place are easily manipulated and hijacked by ambitious individuals, this is four. Therefore, it is known that the tangible National Assembly has more disadvantages than advantages, and it is better to have an intangible system. However, if an intangible system is adopted directly, whether it is the people's self-administration of political power, or the exercise of political power by representatives on behalf of the people, because they are scattered throughout the country, it will be extremely difficult to initiate any powers other than the right to elect, so that they cannot be applied, and having power is equivalent to having no power.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should study the four kinds of direct democracy, that is, the way political power is exercised. Generally speaking, the exercise of political power can be divided into two ways: the right to request or initiate jointly, and the right to vote on the whole. The former can be called the "right of demand," and the joint signature procedure is more troublesome, but the nature is not very important. Because after various demands are established, they must still be accepted by the government or voted on by the people before they can be determined. The latter can be called the "right of ratification," and the national periodic simultaneous voting is relatively simple, but the nature is very important. Because this power is the people's final decision-making power, it is not only sufficient to determine the merits of various demands, but also sufficient to resolve disputes between governments and clarify the responsibilities of various departments. The right of demand and the right of ratification are two completely different powers, and there is no necessary connection between their exercise, according to the practices of various countries. Some only have the right of demand, similar to the petitions of citizens, some are required by law to have a vote by the people, without waiting for the people's demands, and some need to consider other circumstances to determine whether a demand should be submitted for a vote (for details, please refer to my book "Outline of Direct Democracy"). Therefore, the two powers cannot be confused.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, the author has always advocated a compromise system for the design of the National Assembly, entrusting various rights of demand to a tangible National Representative Assembly, and at the same time, reserving various rights of ratification to an intangible National Assembly. This method combines the advantages of both systems without their disadvantages (refer to my book "Collection of Essays on the Five-Power Constitution" for related articles). The author has also advocated that within ten years after the promulgation of the constitution, the members of the councils of each county and city and their equivalent regions should exercise the voting rights of the National Assembly on behalf of all citizens in their respective local regions, in order to avoid practical difficulties. This coincides with the above-mentioned proposal of Wang Yunwu, which shows that our views are similar. The National Assembly advocated by Wang is what the author calls the National Representative Assembly, and the National Assembly designed by the author is simply called National by Wang. As for the temporary exercise of the national voting rights by county councilors, the author and Wang have the same opinion, only the time is slightly different.</p>
<p>The news dispatch about Wang's plan is not detailed, so I have excerpted the full chapter of the articles I have always advocated below for discussion:</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of the Draft Constitution: National Assembly and National Representative Assembly</p>
<p>(1) The National Assembly is composed of citizens of the Republic of China who enjoy civil rights. The acquisition of civil rights shall be in accordance with the provisions of the law.</p>
<p>(2) The meeting of the National Assembly shall be conducted simultaneously in districts within each county, city, and their equivalent regions.</p>
<p>(3) The deliberations of the National Assembly shall be conducted without discussion and by voting; the second deliberation, unless otherwise stipulated in this constitution, shall be determined by a majority of the total number of votes. The procedure for voting in the National Assembly shall be determined by law.</p>
<p>(4) The National Assembly shall be convened by the National Representative Assembly in accordance with the provisions of Article 22, Paragraph 1, Item 11; each session shall not exceed three days.</p>
<p>(5) Within ten years after the promulgation of this constitution, the members of the councils of each county, city, and their equivalent regions shall exercise the voting rights of the National Assembly on behalf of all citizens in their respective local regions.</p>
<p>During the aforementioned period of substitution, the meeting of the National Assembly shall be conducted within the councils of each county, city, and their equivalent regions (this article may be included in the chapter on supplementary provisions).</p>
<p>(6) The functions of the National Assembly are as follows:</p>
<p>1. To elect the presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans, as well as the president and vice president, from the list of candidates proposed by the National Representative Assembly (power of selection).</p>
<p>2. To ratify the recall of the president and the presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans proposed by the National Representative Assembly (power of dismissal).</p>
<p>3. To ratify the proposals to amend the constitution proposed by the National Representative Assembly, and the constitutional amendments proposed by it (power of approval and power of implementation).</p>
<p>4. To ratify the matters proposed for resolution by the National Representative Assembly in accordance with the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 1, Items 6 to 8 (power of implementation, power of approval, and power of dismissal).</p>
<p>The functions in item 4 above may be executed together at the meeting for executing other items.</p>
<p>(7) The National Representative Assembly is composed of national representatives and is responsible to the National Assembly. The allocation of national representative seats should be proportional to the population; however, the total number of representatives shall not exceed four hundred. [To be continued]</p>
<h3>CHAIRMAN OVERLOOKS HIS HOMETOWN OF XIKOU; HOLDS A TEA PARTY WITH EXECUTIVES AND GENTRY BEFORE LEAVING HANGZHOU; URGES HARD WORK AND ENDURANCE TO COMPLETE THE MISSION OF NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Chairman left Hangzhou by special plane "Meiling" the afternoon before yesterday. Originally planned to go to Fenghua, but was limited by time and could not go. However, his concern for his hometown has never been forgotten, so he specially ordered the pilot to return to the sky above Fenghua to overlook his hometown, which he had not seen for nine years. At 4:40, the plane arrived at Xikou in Fenghua, flying at a low altitude of two thousand feet, and the ground scenery was clearly visible. The villagers heard the sound of the Chairman's plane and gathered in the streets to look up and cheer. The Chairman and his wife also waved frequently in the plane to indicate their greetings. The special plane circled three times above the tomb of Chiang's mother, and then flew to the Wuling School, which was bombed by enemy planes during the War of Resistance, and flew low to pay tribute, before flying east to Shanghai. Before leaving Hangzhou, the Chairman also held a tea party in the Zhejiang Provincial Government to entertain the gentry and the heads of various agencies. In his impromptu speech, he said: "Today, I meet with you all. I have no gifts to send to our relatives and friends, only to encourage each other with this sincere heart of serving the country and loving the people, that is, we must all use the heart of being hungry as if we are hungry, and drowning as if we are drowning, to save our compatriots, to revive our nation, to take the world and the country as our own responsibility, to ensure the victory of the War of Resistance, and to complete the mission of national construction. Now our War of Resistance has achieved victory, but you must all anticipate the difficulties of national construction in the future. All compatriots throughout the country must recognize that national construction is an extremely difficult task. We must, under the premise of the entire nation, have a spirit that is more vigorous than during the War of Resistance, work harder than during the War of Resistance, and especially live more frugally and endure more pain than during the War of Resistance. We must grit our teeth, bury our heads and work hard. In this way, after another eight years, perhaps we can build a new country from the dilapidated old society, so that we can be free and independent and survive in today's world. In short, our generation of compatriots must know that since we have encountered this era, suffering and endurance are our duty. We should no longer think about enjoying a comfortable life, or having better expectations for our work treatment. Our generation of people must make up our minds that in order to complete the arduous task of national construction, we must be prepared at all times to live the most painful life and undertake the most tedious work in these thirty years, so that our children and grandchildren can be spared the tragic situation of being slaves and beasts. The story of Goujian, King of Yue, who tasted bitterness, is known to every household in the country, and our victory in the War of Resistance was based on this traditional spirit. But everyone should know that Goujian, King of Yue, who tasted bitterness, was our Zhejiang sage. I hope that Zhejiang and our compatriots throughout the country will not forget the spirit of perseverance and determination to overcome difficulties and seek revenge of our predecessors, work together with one heart, work hard, never give up, and persevere, to build our China into a prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy modern country, and realize the great Three People's Principles proclaimed by our Premier, so that we can be worthy of Zhejiang, the birthplace of nationalism. This is what I offer to all our Zhejiang compatriots, and it is also my only expectation for all our Zhejiang compatriots."</p>

<h3>YAMASHITA TOMOYUKI, WHO DIED IN DISGRACE, ENDED HIS LIFE YESTERDAY BY HANGING</h3>
<p>Before his execution, he said he was blameless before God.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Manila, 23rd] General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the former commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines, who once swept through the Malay Peninsula and captured Singapore with great fame, was executed in Los Banos today for crimes such as condoning his subordinates' slaughter of American and Filipino soldiers and civilians. The execution platform was arranged in an area of forty square feet, surrounded by green wire mesh. At the time of the execution, Yamashita was stripped of his military uniform and all symbols indicating that he was a soldier. Thus, the "Tiger of Malaya" ended his life in disgrace. Before his death, in addition to wishing the Emperor of Japan long life and prosperity, he also hoped that Japan would achieve peace. When Yamashita was escorted to the execution platform, he was accompanied by a translator and a monk. Yamashita remained calm throughout. Hours before the hanging, he told his translator: "I have done my best in performing my duties as the supreme commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines to control my troops. As I said to the Supreme Court of Manila, I have made the greatest effort to restrain my subordinates. Even though I am dying, I can say I am blameless before God. But if you say that I have no power to command the Japanese army, then I have no words to say, because my personality is like that. My country's war criminals will be tried in the Supreme Court of Manila. I hope that by your benevolence and justice, my grievances can be redressed. I acknowledge that the American military personnel have been generous and kind to me. Even though I am dead, I will never forget it. I have no complaints against my executioners. May God bless them." Yamashita's execution was the most closely guarded secret since the end of the war. Photography reporters were not allowed to approach the execution site, and the Philippine detention centers were guarded by police.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 23rd] Tomoyuki Yamashita was hanged here at 3:02 a.m. this morning. He is the first major Japanese war criminal to be executed after being sentenced to death by the Allied Military Tribunal for crimes such as allowing his subordinates to kill. Accompanying Yamashita to the gallows were Ota, the former captain of the Japanese intelligence team in the Philippines, and a Japanese translator, both of whom were also sentenced to death for torturing Filipino civilians. Ota was hanged at 3:41 a.m. and remained calm before his death. The translator died at 4:17 a.m. and looked flustered at the time of his death.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Acharya, president of the Indian National Congress, sent a telegram to the British Anti-Imperialist Center, which is holding its founding meeting here today, asking the British to abandon the imperialism they are implementing in India.

<h3>HOW MUCH SECRET REMAINS IN THE ATOMIC BOMB; AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE CANADIAN ATOMIC SPY CASE</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] How much secret is still kept about the atomic bomb? The Soviet Union's acknowledgment that it had obtained "insignificant" secret records and other information related to atomic energy from Canadians has made people raise the above question. Reviewing the secrets of the atomic bomb, the following three items are still the most important: (1) The manufacturing situation used to mass-produce atomic bomb raw materials. There is more than one manufacturing method, what method is used, and the source of supply. (2) The various parts of the entire atomic bomb, including explosives and the method of causing chain reactions. (3) Information about pressure, radioactivity, heat and other explosive characteristics, from which clues to the structure of the bomb may be found.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Regarding the Canadian atomic spy case, newspaper editorials have different opinions. Some believe that this matter will not lead to a real first-class international incident, and others are deeply afraid that this may show the Soviet Union's attitude, which will have a serious historical impact.</p>

<h3>Liu Hangchen Comes to Shanghai to Preside Over Suppressing Grain Prices: Establishes a Comprehensive Approach</h3>
<p>Official-Merchant Cooperation: Waiting to Hear Grain Merchants' Opinions Before Handling Loan Matters</p>
<p>(Our Dispatch) Liu Hangchen, Administrative Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday with Yang Xizhi, the Special Food Commissioner of this city. Yesterday morning, he convened a meeting of directors and supervisors of the two grain merchant associations to listen to the opinions of the grain merchants and to have a thorough discussion on the entire grain issue in this city. Vice Minister Liu believes that the current food policy does not deviate from three major principles: (1) the issue of whether there is food, (2) the issue of how much food there is, and (3) the issue of how expensive or cheap the food is. According to Commissioner Yang's interview with reporters, the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang had a bumper harvest last autumn, and the output was [redacted text due to unclarity]. Moreover, the amount sold previously was less than 30% of the output. As for the food reserves in this city, they have increased six to eight times compared to early September last year. Therefore, the issue of whether there is enough food has already been resolved. Therefore, the next step is to increase the quantity again, and the price of food will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>Multiple Measures Decided</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting decided on multiple fundamental and palliative measures. On the fundamental side: (1) Cooperating with local governments, financial institutions, etc. to handle grain merchant loans. [redacted text due to unclarity] Sending letters to various state-run and private transportation agencies, giving preferential treatment to grain merchants and giving them priority to reduce procurement costs. (3) Strengthening the organization of grain merchant associations to prevent non-professionals from getting involved in the grain industry. On the palliative side: (1) It is planned to request the central and local governments to take effective measures in accordance with laws and regulations against those who hoard and manipulate food. (2) It is hoped that companies, factories, social groups, etc. in this city can go to the producing areas in groups to purchase rice and grain, and not purchase them in large quantities in the urban area. (3) The citizens of this city should be calm and composed and not rush to buy rice because of the rising price. (4) A reliable communication link is needed between the producing area and the sales area so that the price of food in various places will not be chaotic due to inaccurate reports. (5) It is planned to request the media to publicize and urge speculators not to use food as a target for speculative trading. Commissioner Yang then clarified the purpose of the Food Administration's sale of rice and grain, one is to increase the actual grain supply, and the other is to regulate the people's food. The method of selling is to sell to various rice shops through the Soybean and Rice Industry Association. Therefore, it is not to sell cheap rice or distribute it universally.</p>
<p>Official-Merchant Cooperation Measures</p>
<p>The conclusion of the meeting yesterday was that the government must cooperate with the grain merchants. The method of cooperation is that the government should first fully cultivate the strength of the grain merchants, provide grain merchant purchase rice loans to facilitate the financing of grain merchants, so that on the one hand, they can sell rice and grain in the market, and on the other hand, they still have sufficient funds to purchase rice in the producing area. Therefore, the authorities urgently hope that grain merchants will speed up the strengthening of their organizations so that the government can immediately start handling loan matters. As for the loan amount and plan, there will be specific regulations in the coming days.</p>
<p>Another report, at the meeting yesterday morning, all directors and supervisors sincerely expressed their willingness to cooperate closely with the government to suppress grain prices. Vice Minister Liu immediately limited all directors and supervisors to submit specific cooperation methods required by the grain merchants between 12:00 noon and 3:00 PM today, and continue to hold a meeting to decide on the exact methods and loan figures. Also, the rice price in this city has gradually declined, falling by more than a thousand yuan yesterday, and Bai Geng has fallen to 28,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Trial of Traitors</h3>

<h3>No Room to Reach Out, No Permission to Speak: All Telephones Removed, Further Crackdown on Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, all 1,100+ telephones installed in the securities firms of the Securities Building, which is known as the headquarters of speculation, were removed by technicians sent by the Shanghai Telephone Company at the request of the police authorities and handed over to the Public Utilities Bureau for safekeeping. It is learned that after the crackdown on gold speculation, speculators were not without apprehension and dared not openly gather to trade, but private transactions have not been eradicated, especially in front of the money exchange shops in the Sichuan Road Central Road area, where Jewish and Luzon people are still secretly buying and selling gold and US dollars, and it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to them.</p>
<h3>Thousands Shout Slogans Outside the Gate, Dignitaries Welcomed at Wine Reception: Soviet Side Holds Reception for Leaders of All Circles to Commemorate Red Army Day</h3>
<p>Mayor Qian, Madam Sun, and Others Went to Congratulate</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather here was clear in the morning, but by noon the weather suddenly changed, with wind and rain, like the current situation in Northeast China, subtle and unpredictable. February 23 also marks the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Red Army, which is also the first Red Army Day after the war. Anani Ivanov, the Acting Consul General of the Soviet Union in Shanghai, and Major Andrei Av, the Deputy Military Attaché in Shanghai, jointly held a cocktail reception at the Consulate General from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, inviting over 700 people from all circles in China and abroad. At the same time, thousands of student groups in this city gathered in front of the gate of the Soviet Consulate, shouting slogans, which contrasted strangely and humorously with the Soviet classical music welcoming the dignitaries on the upper floor of the consulate. The Soviet Consulate staff were particularly attentive to the Chinese guests, bowing to greet them at the gate and shaking hands as a courtesy. Soviet Consul Anani Ivanov and Major Andrei Av shook hands with the guests one by one in front of the reception room on the second floor.</p>
<p>Among yesterday's guests, 50% were Soviet citizens. There were people from the political, military, and business circles. The rest were diplomats from various countries and leaders from all walks of life in this city. Mayor Qian, Madam Sun Qingling, Shen Junru, Chen Guolian, and others all went to congratulate. Most of the Soviet citizens present could speak fluent Mandarin and frequently told the guests about their experiences traveling to various parts of Southeast, Northwest, and Northeast China. They expressed that they were not clear about the student demonstration downstairs and asked the Chinese guests, "What are they doing downstairs?" The Soviet envoys yesterday used "Caucasian wine" made from grapes and the famous "Vodka" to entertain the guests. Various cold dishes, such as Xiangyang, cold meat, and Russian cold platters, were served. The Russian women, who were serving the guests, were very good at drinking and repeatedly asked the guests to toast. The guests gradually left at 1:00 PM. In the evening at 8:00 PM, the Soviet envoys also held a popular music concert at the Lyceum Theatre, inviting leaders from all circles to participate. The concert was divided into three parts. The first part, in addition to playing the Soviet national anthem and the national anthems of various allied countries, included choral pieces, solo pieces, and symphonies. The second part included two solo pieces and Tchaikovsky's "1812" Overture. The third part was the ballet "The Little Humpbacked Horse," which featured dozens of performers on stage.</p>
<h3>Twentieth Century East Road Robbery: Innkeeper and Teahouse Attendant Also Punished</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, three thieves with guns broke into 211 Ganshi East Road, Gancun, and robbed many pieces of jewelry. Two thieves escaped first, and one thief was guarding the entrance and escaped late. The victim followed and shouted "Robber!" Police officers from the Jiashan Road Police Station of the Changshu Road Sub-Bureau heard the sound and rushed to the scene and apprehended the thief. He confessed that his name was Wei Weilie and that he stayed in rooms 209 and 216 of the Dahu Hotel. Zhang Canguang, the director of the Judicial Section of the sub-bureau, led the police officers to search the hotel. When they arrived, there was no one in the rooms. Later, another bandit called and instructed Wei to meet at the Laobesen Road vegetable market. The police officers immediately went to the scene and captured another thief named Xu Jialin, confiscating a pistol and a gold ring. He confessed that they were all orderlies of Cai Jun, the commander of the former Kunshan Security Team. Cai Jun initiated the robbery, and Cai Jun has now fled upon hearing the news, and other accomplices, Yang Biao and Zhou Songnan, have also fled. It is heard that the Changshu Road Sub-Bureau has detained the Dahu Hotel teahouse attendant for failing to pay attention to the suspicious travelers.</p>
<h3>Customs Employees Once Went on Strike; Telecommunications Labor Dispute Still Unresolved; Western Restaurant Labor-Management Negotiations Break Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 12:00 noon, approximately 1,500 workers, including upper and lower-level staff, at the Inspector General of Customs (IGC) office on Hardoon Road, the Jianghai Customs House on the Bund, and its affiliated Statistics Department, Maritime Department, and Port Authority, went on strike. They resumed work at 4:30 PM. It is reported that the workers' monthly income ranges from over 30,000 yuan at the highest to over 20,000 yuan at the lowest. Recently, due to the pressure of living expenses, they have been unable to make ends meet. They previously submitted a request to the authorities, demanding: (1) An increase in February wages to 112,000 yuan. (2) Supplementary issuance of year-end bonuses of 112,000 yuan. (3) Subsidy for loans of 112,000 yuan. (4) Future wages should increase according to the cost of living index. (5) Uniform treatment for all employee subsidies. (6) Inclusion in the official staff roster, with the same 20-grade system as officials. Failing to receive a response from the authorities, the above situation occurred. Deputy Customs Commissioner Ding Guitang subsequently convened a meeting with the employees in the Jianghai Customs House building, promising to give full consideration to their demands.</p>
<p>Repeated Discussions Yield No Results</p>
<p>The strike wave at the Ministry of Transportation's Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio Station had not yet subsided as of last night. Reliable sources indicate that on the 22nd at 4:00 PM, the employees sent six representatives to meet with the Bureau Director, presenting a list of demands to the Bureau. The meeting lasted until 9:00 PM. The Bureau then decided on three measures: (1) Permission to increase benefits. (2) Approval for each level to borrow 50,000 yuan uniformly. (3) A deadline for all to return to work that evening. The representatives immediately expressed acceptance, but after returning to the Bureau to convey the opinions, the colleagues considered them unsatisfactory and refused to accept them, continuing the strike. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, responsible persons from various departments convened a meeting to discuss and express their opinions, requesting the Bureau to consolidate the colleagues' first two demands into one, granting a uniform loan of 80,000 yuan regardless of position. Living allowances must be based on the Shanghai cost of living index, sufficient to support a family of six. Base salaries should be determined according to the Ministry's regulations. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, sixteen representatives were sent again to discuss with the Bureau. The Bureau, in addition to insisting on the original proposal, only agreed to allocate welfare funds and expedite the establishment of an employee welfare association. Last night, the employees held a general meeting and decided to continue the strike. It is also reported that Director Yu feels extremely troubled by handling this issue and has submitted his resignation to the General Bureau.</p>
<p>Western Restaurants Went on Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>The labor disputes at Western restaurants such as Central, Atlantic, and New Richfield continued to be negotiated yesterday. The labor side insisted on the reinstatement of employees dismissed by Jin Gu and Seven Heavens and put forward demands. As a result, due to conflicting opinions between the two sides, the negotiations were declared broken. Eleven Western restaurants began a strike at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Continued Negotiations in the Cotton Textile Industry</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] (1) After a general strike by cotton textile workers the day before yesterday, more than fifty factories in both districts resumed work successively yesterday morning after persuasion by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, negotiations will continue today and tomorrow. (2) Two hundred and ten workers dismissed from the Longhua Cement Factory gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, demanding reinstatement. After the Bureau contacted the management, it has been decided to rehire them in stages. (3) The demands of the gas company's employees to improve their benefits have been mediated for several days, and most of them have been resolved. It is reported that a settlement record will be signed soon. (4) The Western-style furniture industry labor dispute has been completely resolved through labor-management coordination. (5) The Fourth District Electrical Industry Workers' Union held a tea party at the International Hotel's 14th floor yesterday afternoon to thank reporters and officials involved in mediating the labor dispute, as the labor dispute has been successfully resolved. (6) Chinese workers and drivers at the U.S. Army Transportation Office felt it was necessary to further improve their benefits as everything is now expensive, so they went on strike again the night before last. (7) The employees of the Commercial Press previously made four requests to the Press for improved benefits. The Social Affairs Bureau repeatedly mediated, and Director Wu ruled that the Press should issue an additional 22,000 yuan on top of the relief funds issued by the Press to temporarily maintain their living. Regarding salaries, he guaranteed a reasonable adjustment of salaries before March 3 according to the cost of living index. The employees then temporarily resumed normal work and await resolution.</p>

<h3>Hankou Japanese Army Atrociously Murdered American Airmen Case: Deputy Director of the Military Police Intelligence Section Confesses the Circumstances of the Strangulation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The U.S. Military Tribunal continued to interrogate Seigawa Shoji, a private first class in the Japanese 34th Division News Section, yesterday morning regarding the Hankou murder of American airmen case. Seigawa denied participating in the parade of the three American airmen in Hankou, claiming he only saw them on the road but did see the three being hanged. He also saw one of them stand up from the ground before being hanged, so he pushed him down. He also said: "I was ordered to guard the crematorium to monitor prisoners of war to prevent them from escaping. Later, I helped carry the legs of one of the dead American airmen to the cremation site." Seigawa firmly stated that he did not know who carried out the hanging because it was at night. He only knew that Sergeant Tai Jūji (who is missing) ordered someone to bring the rope and later reported to Lieutenant Iizumi that "the three prisoners of war have been cremated."</p>
<p>Next, Sergeant Major Masui Shoji, Acting Deputy Director of the Hankou Japanese Military Police Intelligence Section, was interrogated. Masui testified that on the morning of December 16, 1944, he received an order from Lieutenant Colonel Akabe stating: "Today, we received an order from the division that the Chinese side will hold a parade of three American airmen. You and three other military police officers are to go and be responsible for maintaining order." He was ordered to escort the three from prison and tie them up. He also described the parade formation, saying that there were more Chinese military police than Japanese soldiers, but because there were not enough people, they could not resist when rioting crowds beat the three American airmen. He also testified that he assisted in strangling two American airmen and described the circumstances at the time. The plaintiff's defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel West, asked if he felt sorry and compassionate for the three who were killed. Masui said he personally felt compassion, but he could not consider it at the time because it was done under orders and he could not resist.</p>
<p>The interrogation ended at noon yesterday and will continue next Monday. The sentencing date is expected to be next Wednesday or Thursday. The trial date for the case of the three airmen under General Doolittle who bombed Tokyo and were killed by the Japanese has not been set, but it is expected to be held after the Hankou case concludes.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Speculative Activities Restricted; Gold and Currency Decline Compared to Previous Levels; Securities No Longer Publicly Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the removal of all telephones from the Securities Exchange Building, speculators' activities were further restricted. Some transactions moved to other locations and were conducted secretly. Relaxed news regarding the Northeast issue was published in the North-China Daily News, etc., and people's hearts were slightly calmed. At the same time, as the authorities were conducting strict investigations, money exchange businesses also feared the lessons of the Securities Exchange Building and dared not accept buying and selling of funds. Those holding goods were eager to sell at high prices, and market prices slightly weakened. If the authorities can thoroughly expand the scope [of the investigations], tense minds can gradually be calmed. The morning opening was still quoted around 1.9 million, with various parties fishing in troubled waters and acting independently. It was extremely difficult to obtain an accurate reflection of market value, and the situation was unusually chaotic. However, in reality, prices above 1.92 million were likely not genuine. Scattered bulls gradually sought to sell, and prices dropped to 1.7 million. The US dollar remained relatively stable due to settlement of cotton yarn trades, supporting the gold market, which hovered around 1.8 million. Ultimately, as the overall trend approached sunset, there was no way to stir up trouble. At noon, it struggled around 1.75 million, a decline of 110,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments remained unlisted. Fine silver was at 2,000 yuan, and silver dollars were around 1,100 yuan, with varying quoted prices. The black market interest rate initially retreated to 18% due to the Securities Exchange Building being shut down, but later rose back to 24%.</p>
<p>Because money exchange businesses at each station set their own standards, there was a huge spread between buying and selling quotes for foreign currencies. At the beginning of the morning, there were sellers at 2,700 yuan, gradually falling below 2,550 yuan. Yarn businesses continued to absorb, but in the afternoon, large sellers of physical goods quoted 2,600 yuan, resulting in a lack of momentum for prices to rise. In the afternoon, quotes varied around 2,550 yuan, and the result was a slight decline of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes were initially stable, then slightly weakened, with old notes trading at 430 yuan, but the result was a slight decline of 10 yuan. Securities businesses felt slightly bored with new notes, and there was no activity, also declining 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Only Type C government bonds had some liquidity around 1,900 yuan, but this was only temporary. Other bonds were unmarketable. Chinese and foreign stocks had no place to gather, lacked public trading, and quoted prices were difficult to estimate.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Fluctuated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market started weak and ended strong. In the early morning, people's hearts were very empty, and there was a chorus of selling. 16-count Bright yarn once fell to 940,000, but clients absorbed at low prices, and the price gradually recovered to 1,040,000 at the close, an increase of 40,000 compared to the previous day's morning price. However, 20-count Blue Phoenix and Jincheng yarns were only around 1,150,000, and Shuangma was only 1,125,000, a drop of 50,000 compared to the previous day. People's hearts were calm, and the trend was still stable. The Textile Construction Company opened sales of various woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, blankets, burlap bags, and other goods yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton trading was peaceful. The Textile Construction Company traded over 600 bales of American cotton 42-grade raw fine cotton Middling, with prices ranging from 100,000 yuan to 102,000 yuan. 500 bales of Dazhong grade. In addition, private yarn factories were waiting and seeing due to Saturday. Traders did Zhoupu seed cotton among themselves at 18,500 to 19,000 yuan. Market prices varied.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Again Requests Allocation of Gray Fabrics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special News] The China Textile Construction Company previously responded to the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association's letter requesting the allocation of gray fabrics, but because military needs are currently urgent, it is planning unified supply. As soon as there is some surplus, it will immediately allocate them. Now, the Association has sent another letter to the Textile Construction Company, hoping that it will consider both national and civilian needs and quickly allocate gray fabrics.</p>
<h3>Silk is Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Rayon Warehouse Receipts Prohibited from Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was quite stable, and trading was also quiet. Another lot of raw silk was quoted slightly higher at 50,000 yuan. The transaction price of another lot of raw silk was 1.65 million yuan. Due to the absolute prohibition of rayon warehouse receipt transactions starting yesterday, off-exchange dark market trading also disappeared. Yesterday's spot prices for No. 120 Tianqiao remained the same as the previous day, and there were no transactions until the afternoon. Only one piece of No. 120 semi-matte was traded in the morning at a price of 2.45 million yuan. Factory sales needed it, so they painfully purchased it. Silk goods were flat and weak. American bedding fell 30,000 yuan per hundred, and Dage Wang crepe fell slightly by 100 yuan per roll. Hongkang black and white crepe and Minsheng brocade were still quoted at the previous day's prices.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Sales are Quite Prosperous</h3>
<p>Green tea varieties are still in high demand in Tianjin, Yingkou, and other places. Recently, the number transported from this city to the Tianjin area has reached more than 6,000 bundles, mostly fried green tea, and also many jasmine and pearl orchid teas. According to Tianjin merchants, tea stocks in that area are very scarce, and there may be considerable demand in the future. As for the tea market in this city, the inventory is also not very abundant. Therefore, those who hold goods mostly insist on high prices.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The large-scale dumping of low-priced rice for several days, coupled with smoother supply, has led to sluggish demand on this street, and rice prices have begun to decline, each by 1,000 yuan. Yesterday, there were still thousands of stones of late indica rice being dumped, but the price remained unchanged. The flour market is trending further downstream, falling another 300-400 yuan. The soybean market uniformly fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were still flat, and Kaifeng goods fell by 1,000 yuan. The oil market fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan or more. Soybean cakes also showed a weak trend. Huishan opened at 5,400 yuan and gradually fell to close at 5,100 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar association had a batch of sugar for sale, including 1,000 bags of white medium sugar, priced at 54,000 yuan, up 6,000 yuan, and sold completely. 2,000 bags of green sugar, priced at 40,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan, were not sold completely. White medium sugar from Guangzhou was 57,500 yuan, and Chaozhou bags were 56,500 to 57,000 yuan. Merchants offered dozens of bags of high-quality green sugar at a price of 52,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile Factories Order Machinery from the US</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper News) To add machinery and equipment and strengthen production, major domestic textile factories have ordered textile machinery from the United States. The price of roving frames is US$420,000 and the price of spinning frames is US$380,000 (both based on 10,000 spindles). Adding taxes, insurance, and freight, the cost of each is over US$500,000.</p>

<h3>Constructing a Dramatic Culture [Part 2]</h3>
<p>— Tang Shaohua</p>
<p>Before Confucius, the business of drama had already developed in a distorted way. Just like now, theater performers had to depend on people like Emperor Xuanzong of Tang to survive. People regarded theater performers as tools for entertainment. Therefore, those who knew a little about self-love and self-respect, and who did not want to degrade themselves into toys, were all working hard to avoid approaching drama, and sometimes even included theatrical performances in their prohibitions.</p>
<p>However, prohibiting theatrical performances is not necessarily beneficial to the world and people's hearts. By Confucius' time, the world and people's hearts were already declining like a river. Therefore, based on his own research and understanding of dramatic arts, he loudly called out to his disciples to use "drama to save the world." How can drama save the world? Of course, there was a strong theoretical basis behind it, so he dared to advocate this unprecedented idea that "even the sage kings would not do." (See Xunzi's "Rituals and Music" chapter.)</p>
<p>In order to implement his ideas, Confucius first determined the value of drama. He firmly argued that drama was not a toy for entertainment, but a tool for educating the masses. The act of performing drama was an act of education, and the performer was an educator. But how could a performer become an educator? Therefore, secondly, he noticed that in order to enhance the value of drama, it was necessary to simultaneously improve the social status of theater performers. Confucius liked to interact with theater performers throughout his life, discussing theatrical arts. He was indeed unlike the intellectual class at the time, who generally liked actors but looked down on them. He promoted the importance of this industry everywhere for theater workers. However, later on, he also realized that simply promoting in this way was still ineffective, and there must be a reason for this. After running through several countries, he invented a new method. Therefore, thirdly, he discovered that in order to improve the social status of actors, there was still a need for preliminary work, which was to review the scripts. Therefore, Confucius had the matter of "editing the poems and correcting the music," and reviewing the content of the scripts, deleting lyrics and actions that harmed the dignity of the performers.</p>
<p>However, he had virtue but no position. At the time, he was only reviewing scripts for society in a private capacity, so the effect was very small, only influencing his own students. According to his students' notes, Confucius' standards for reviewing drama - that is, his requirements for drama - were simply that "the sound is sufficient to bring joy without being lascivious, the text is sufficient to reason without ceasing, and the melody and rhythm are sufficient to move people's good hearts." (See Record of Music.)</p>
<p>Such strict requirements are naturally difficult to meet well. First, extracting the components that could be enjoyed (in a low-level way) from drama would displease Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. (The Emperor Xuanzong of Tang at that time should be represented by people like Duke Jing of Jin and Marquis Wen of Wei; the rest can be analogized.) Second, actors who relied on people like Emperor Xuanzong of Tang as their patrons to maintain their livelihoods knew that the Emperor's displeasure would immediately affect their survival, and therefore were also dissatisfied with Confucius' approach. Confucius thought of theatrical education in order to save the world, thought of improving the status of theater performers for theatrical education, and implemented script review in order to improve the status of theater performers. He single-mindedly promoted the drama movement in this way, but as a result, only his disciples knew about it, and the theater performers of the world did not understand him enough, and only knew how to worship Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. When there is an Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, there will be actors. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang is always leading the actors, so actors will always be actors, and actors can never become theatrical workers who can bear the task of education.</p>
<p>If we mention the construction of a theatrical culture currently, it seems that the paths we can follow are no more than these few. To improve the function of drama, we must also improve the status of theater performers. To improve the status of theater performers, it seems that we must pay attention to the content of the scripts, as well as improve the level of actors' cultivation. In a word, it is to move drama and theater workers (no longer actors) entirely from the realm of entertainment to the realm of education!</p>
<h3>"The Lute Song" Staged in the United States</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yingdai</p>
<p>A Chinese drama, "The Lute Song," was staged in Boston. Based on Chinese classics, translated from French into American English, with Sydney Howard and Will Irwin serving as playwrights, it mixed Western ideas according to Eastern concepts. The sole purpose of this play was to eliminate the barriers between Eastern and Western people. With music composed by Raymond Scott, lyrics by Fina Hain, singing conducted by Evgeny Mulawka, and costumes and scenery by Edmund Jones. All the performers were famous American artists.</p>
<p>The performance was very successful. The plot was half dramatic and half poetic, with Broadway stars Jill Corbitt and Sullivan playing the male and female leads. Their acting was just right in every move. The singing part was even more pleasant. The entire performance was full of humor, and the performance style was completely in Chinese colors, suitable for the time and space. The audience forgot that they were Westerners in the last few scenes and were filled with Eastern psychology.</p>
<p>The story is simple, depicting a young scholar named Cai who goes to the capital to seek officialdom due to his father's orders. But he is not willing to do so psychologically. He only reluctantly leaves his beloved wife and goes to Kyoto because he cannot disobey his father's orders. After being promoted to official, the emperor ordered him to marry a royal woman. In fact, he became a criminal in Kyoto and repeatedly tried to escape, but was eventually blocked by his father-in-law and could not fulfill his wish. His parents passed away one after another in the years of famine. His wife searched for her husband thousands of miles and found him. Thanks to the achievement of his second wife, they were reunited.</p>
<p>In terms of personality, all the characters in the play, the young scholar has great ambitions, but no one helps him. The father is somewhat authoritarian, and the mother has tasted all kinds of hardships. The first wife is a person who listens to fate, and the second wife is a woman who sacrifices herself and is humble. Scott made the plot full of Chinese colors, and the songs he composed occasionally reflected the comedic tone. The biggest success lies in the costumes and scenery. On the first night of the performance, the theater was full, and after the audience left, everyone gained a deep impression and kept praising it.</p>
<p>Theater Review</p>
<h3>Second Honeymoon</h3>
<p>— Chen Shiqian</p>
<p>"Second Honeymoon" is the sixteenth creation of the playwright and celebrated actor of London's New York, Noel Coward, originally titled "Private Lives." Li Pu adapted it, adding a scene and several characters, presumably to cater to Chinese tastes and the current times, hence the change to "Second Honeymoon," which is quite fitting for the plot.</p>
<p>Although there are few subplots and little action, the content and plot are rich. The director is not bad, and each actor is competent in their "role," making the performance of "Second Honeymoon" not too disappointing.</p>
<p>Pan Aimei as Luo Lan speaks clearly, possesses a beautiful figure, and has a natural expression, making her quite attractive to the audience. Chen Juanjuan's eye makeup is too dark (is it because I was sitting in the second row?). This diminishes her "original" beauty and is worth correcting. However, when the couple quarrels during their honeymoon in Hong Kong and the husband becomes violent, asking her to put on a "crying face" amidst the romance under the moon is quite difficult, yet she does it naturally.</p>
<p>Zhang Mingqiang's Qiaoqi is very successful. His expressions, language, actions, and demeanor are skillfully executed. While the director is important, the actor's own intelligence is crucial. His "gags" and "interjections" are a bit excessive, but they are not vulgar and do not cater to lowbrow interests. As for Pan Yu'an's Bai Mu, because his character is inherently "unique" in the plot, there is nothing wrong with it, but his memorization of lines still leaves room for improvement.</p>
<p>In fact, Noel Coward's original work is already compact and full of "meaning." Why add Mrs. Zhu and Mr. Zhu? What's the point of this kind of "gag"? Because adding Mr. Zhu is like "drawing legs on a snake," it's no wonder that Hu Xiaofeng (Huang Kai?) resorts to "clownish" actions. What's the use of this kind of farce?</p>
<p>The lighting and props are acceptable.</p>
<p>After watching it, I feel that this "play" is worth recommending, a "clever" marriage. It exists in modern society, not just in the West. Noel Coward even wrote this play in the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai. This kind of "marital change" also exists in the East!</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Bloodbath Record</h3>
<p>— Screening at the Jinmen Theatre in Paris</p>
<p>During this war, various countries put a lot of effort into producing propaganda war films. However, after the war, only a few films of this type retained their value. This is because those films had a broad vision, not only portraying a specific event that happened at a particular time and place, but also displaying the universal phenomena that the era caused in humanity; they were full of emotion, not only revealing the author's own feelings, but also capturing the personality of each character in the story and the emotions that external events evoked in them, reaching a level of realism and rationality. At the same time, in terms of technique, whether in screenwriting, directing, photography, music, or performance, they were harmoniously developed to the extreme. Even after the audience had become disconnected from the era of filmmaking, and there were no longer waves of emotion within them to help the work shake their feelings, these films could still control the audience's emotions. "Soviet Army Bloodbath Record" belongs to this category of films.</p>
<p>The director's handling of this film immediately attracts the audience, holding them tightly and never giving them any superfluous transition shots, allowing the audience's will to wander until the "end" signal is shown on the screen. The atmosphere of the entire film can be divided into three stages: First, before the Soviet-German war was declared (actually, before it was undeclared), there was a great effort to showcase peace and happiness. From the old farmer Kaplai's visit to the ancient forest doctor to the villagers' entertainment evening, this pleasant emotion generated by the beauty and peace of life rose linearly to its peak. This emotion had not yet dissipated during the hiking trip. From then on, the German army's undeclared war rapidly shifted into the brewing of anger. However, this stage was only a kind of anger that dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. Before this anger erupted into heroic combat, it was only intensifying the suppressed components. At the same time, as the successful guiding thread for the heroic feats below, the battle along the way for Da Min and others to escort firearms, and finally the restoration of the North Star Village, was the climax of the entire story, but also the finale. The whole story ended like this.</p>
<p>In this story, apart from the varying amount of screen time each person has, there are no individual protagonists, but rather a group of people. Therefore, in this film, although there are many famous actors, they all have room to develop, unlike some star-studded films that only let you see the stars and not the characters in the play. Walter Huston's portrayal of the ancient forest doctor and the German military leader Colonel Haddon (played by von Stroheim), who is also a doctor, is a prominent contrast, representing the two sides of the invaded and the invader. In the end, when Gulin shoots and kills Colonel Haddon, it gives a sense of satisfaction. Flaggland and Annie Feist play a young couple, Da Min and Marina, deeply portraying the contradiction between young people's love and sacrifice. However, my personal favorite is Kim Hye-suk's portrayal of the country girl Claudia. She is talkative, cowardly, and tears stream down her face when she goes to the battlefield. She murmurs prayers for God's blessing. However, she eventually participates in the battle and becomes a martyr. The director did not create her as a natural hero, but the fact that the most cowardly people can become heroes truly represents this era.</p>
<p>Even more commendable are the film's photography and music. The photographer is my Chinese-American in Hollywood, the great photographer Huang Shizhan. His attainments are second to none even in Hollywood. The music aspect is the weakest in our country's film industry. However, watching "Soviet Army Bloodbath Record" shows how much the music contributed to the creation of the atmosphere. The first half has several Soviet folk songs, all of which are extremely beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>This film is an epic of the Soviet people's resistance to war produced by Hollywood. It is truly remarkable that two countries with such different political views, the United States, could produce such a work for the Soviet Union, and it is enough to show the greatness of democratic countries. The United States has also fulfilled its allied responsibility in film.</p>
<h3>Words from a Moviegoer</h3>
<p>— Hawke</p>
<p>Before the movie starts, when the national anthem is played and the leader's portrait is displayed, viewers often make unintentional mistakes that urgently need to be corrected. The following are examples:</p>
<p>(1) When the national anthem is played, viewers are slow to stand up, and before the entire song is finished, they start to sit down at the last syllable, and their attitude is not serious at all, looking back and forth constantly.</p>
<p>(2) Those who are looking for seats or have just entered the venue and hear the national anthem should stop where they are and face the screen until the national anthem is finished before continuing to look for a seat. However, this is not the case. They do their own thing and act as if they don't hear the national anthem. This situation is very common.</p>
<p>(3) When the portraits of the Founding Father or President Chiang appear on the screen, viewers should silently and respectfully gaze at them and should not applaud or cheer. You should know that playing the national anthem is the most solemn occasion and should be kept quiet. Applauding at this time not only disrespects the leader's original intention, but also insults the entire country's representative—the national anthem—more than anything else. I have encountered this many times and feel very unhappy.</p>
<p>The above points are the most common. They seem simple, but their meaning is very significant. The cinema is a very complex place, with people from all countries present. A slight oversight can lead to being laughed at and losing the dignity of the nation.</p>
<p>As for the noise and clamor in the theaters, which is very different from before, I will not discuss it because it is not within the scope of this article. I hope that the theater management will pay attention to improvements.</p>
