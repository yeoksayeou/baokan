<h3>憲草問題討論熱烈　孫科稱需修改可容納</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十九日電〕政治協商會議，自十日起舉行，迄十九日，已開會九次，預定討論之五類議題，今已研討完畢。明日星期日，該會休會一日。第十次會議，尚有待分組會議協商告一段落後，再行決定。</p>
<p>〔又電〕協商會議分組委會施政綱領組，今日下午三時，在國防最高委會開會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十九日電〕政治協商會議各小組委員會，現正埋首研究各項問題，其重要者爲：（一）軍隊之改編及國家化問題，共黨要求此舉與政府復員計劃同時進行。（二）組織國務會議，委員人數以三分之一爲限。（三）五月五日在京召開國民代表大會問題。（四）憲法問題，共黨要求依照美英採取內閣制。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十九日電〕政治協商會議第九次會議，於十九日上午九時舉行，討論憲草問題。首由政府代表孫科，說明五五憲草之內容及其精神。黃炎培，沈鈞儒，傅斯年，胡霖，曾琦，楊永浚，張申府，吳玉章，李燭塵諸氏，相繼發言。會議由孫科主席，雷秘書長報告出席會員余家菊等卅二人後，孫會員科以政府代表資格，對五五憲草加以說明，分述（一）政權與治權，（二）國民大會，（三）五院制度，（四）總統制，（五）地方制度，（六）人民權利自由各點，逐一闡明。孫氏並談，該項憲草如有需修改之處，自可容納。（孫科說明原詞，明日續刋第三版）。</p>
<p>黃炎培氏以其參與憲政期成會及憲政實施協進會工作之經騐，認爲五五憲草有從新研討之必要。渠稱：研討憲草，應持冷靜，絕對客觀與遠見之態度。渠繼綜述各方對憲草內容之意見，並列舉應予考慮之問題如：（一）人民權利之法律限制，（二）男女平等之具體規定，（三）三院制度，（四）總統權限及副總統與行政院長問題，（五）省長之民選問題。渠贊同胡霖氏主張，成立憲草委員會，聘請專家，詳加研討。</p>
<p>沈鈞儒氏繼之發言，着重地方政權問題。渠詳述其當年參與天壇憲草工作時之情形，及當時渠對於地方制度問題之主張，最後提及政府與中共代表會談紀要第十項「關於解放各地方政府問題」。渠表示應提出政治協商會議討論，並認爲應承認中共地區之「抗日歷史性」及「政治進步性」憲草內容，則留待小組討論。</p>
<h3>主張成立審議會　五院制與省區地位應考慮</h3>
<p>傅斯年氏謂：五五憲草係根據五權憲法之精義而擬定，此項憲法，旣爲三民主義之憲法，則應表現三民主義之貫澈性，但其內容，對民權之行使，與國內各小民族問題，均無特別規定。對於國民大會問題，渠認為此種制度因時代變遷，已有修正必要。渠建議如仍採五院制，可以立法院作爲下院，監察院作爲上院，運用各國兩院制之國會職權，兩院名稱可仍舊，惟職權擴大，不必有國會之名，但有國會之實。立法委員一部，由國大選出，大部由人民直接選舉，監察委員由省議會選出。如此則一面接受五權憲法之原則，一面實行兩院制之議會制度，兩者可兼顧。傅氏並認爲省區應加調整，惟反對聯省自治。</p>
<p>胡霖氏稱：三民主義不但中國人不反對，世界學者亦不能認爲不對，然運用之法則，應加考慮。吾人尊重孫中山先生之精神，但不必拘於形式。胡氏並稱：五五憲草可討論之處甚多，例如國民大會問題，應吾設立，大有考慮必要，蓋其職權本可由立法院行使，則何需此龐大之機構形式。創制與複決權，渠重提昨日之建議，由政協會議或由政府設立憲草審議委員會，加以研討，人數不宜過多，並限三四個月內完成。</p>
<p>曾崎氏謂：憲法爲國家根本大法，故有其尊嚴性，渠主張組織憲草審議會。渠認爲憲法之性質，應爲柔性，並應採取內閣制，兩院制五院制，祗可保其精神，不必拘於形式。省制應採均權主義，確定省之自治地位。</p>
<p>楊永浚氏今日首次發言謂：地方應重於中央，自治專於行政，並强調省應爲最高自治單位，省長由民選，並確定中央與省之均權制度。</p>
<p>張申府氏提出三原則：（一）憲草須修改，須合乎國情，本國歷史及世界潮流。（二）不祗顧及現在，且應開闢將來。（三）人民權不應予以限制，並予以自由機會。</p>
<p>吳玉章氏謂：憲法之根本方針，應根據三民主義建國原則，並適應世界潮流，與中國情況，此爲大家之希望。孫中山先生之偉大精神，亦應善爲納入憲法之內。渠繼提出以下原則：（一）保障人民權利，不應用普通法律限制。（二）關於中央與地方之權限，採用孫中山先生均權主義，五院制度分割權力，殆等於無權，致總統權力太大。吳氏並稱：世界上最民主之國家爲英美，吾人將來可採用英美之國會制度，惟須參酌我國實際情况。（三）地方自治問題，省為自治單位，省長由民選，依照孫先生遺敎，制度省憲，使地方可自由發展。（四）確定國策，在憲法上規定軍事上採民主請神，非軍國主義精神，使軍人爲人民服務。文化與經濟方面，均應任其自由發展，不加限制。李燭塵氏謂：憲草中平均地權與節制資本問題應以前者爲先，後者爲後。李氏並特別提出，應重視民族資本與民族工業之口號，主席旋以昨日張厲生氏建議，由各方推定一人，對連日議題，作一總檢討，當決定待各小組協商後再提，一時散會。</p>
<h3>共軍圍攻兗州　復迫守軍投降</h3>
<p>〔中央社濟南十九日電〕圍攻津浦綫上兗州之共產軍指揮官新四軍第二縱隊司令葉飛，曾於十三日以該司令名義及共產黨政委賴傳珠，副政委譚識龍共同署名，送達通牒，迫令守城軍隊向共產軍投降。已由李副長官延年，電請軍事委員會，轉知共產黨負責人，對於共產軍此種荒謬情形，速予糾正。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十八日電〕錦州訊，自停戰命令頒發後，共軍在東北地區變本加厲，襲擊國軍，此種背信負義行爲，實屬令人忍無可忍。頃據各方報告所得。（一）我駐建昌寳安第四支隊於大川部，被共軍包圍，十六日更增加千餘人猛烈圍攻，企圖毀滅於部並佔領該地。（二）我駐泡子彰武西南數十公里之護路部隊，十五日被共軍第三師某旅約近千人襲擊，並破壞鐵路。（三）海城共軍十三日·十四日向我趙軍劉師攻擊，並於十四日在盤山·大虎山附近破壞鐵道，並將盤山以北鐵道橋樑毀壞。又津浦綫滄縣十五公里之馮家口鐵路，被共軍破壞八千公尺，南行車已不能到達滄縣。</p>
<h3>翁文灝明日赴京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕全國公路會議，定二十日在京開幕。又行政院副院長翁文　，資委會副主委錢昌照，定二十一日來京。</p>
<h3>花甲老員工　凖暫緩退休</h3>
<p>交部令川滇滇越兩路</p>
<p>〔本報昆明十八日電〕交通部直屬各路員工，前曾令飭年逾六旬者可自動呈請退休，近以復員期間收復區需員收復，特於日昨電令川滇·滇越兩鐵路局，所有年逾六旬員工，准予暫緩五年退休。</p>
<h3>博山淄川兩煤礦區　失業工人逾萬名　礦塲設備損害程度驚人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕據頃由靑島來京之某礦業家談：自停戰命令公布後，共軍破壞膠濟·津浦兩路煤礦之結果，略如下述：（一）膠濟路張博支路之博山礦區及淄川礦區之採礦機器及電器設備，大部已爲共軍毀壞，少數爲其運往魯南冠水藏匿，工人失業者在一萬以上，致取給最便之靑島現亦發生嚴重煤荒。（二）津浦綫於泰縣屬之礦區，臨棗支路之棗莊中興煤礦及賈汪區礦，其礦塲設備大部已被破壞，工人死傷數千，中興公司存煤約有廿五萬噸，現屬無法運出。中興儲存連雲港之煤，現已設法運濟靑島，如連平漢·平綏兩路沿綫被共軍破壞之礦區計入，其損害程度誠堪驚人。所喜晉省井陘煤礦政府已派員前往接受整理，開灤煤礦產量日增，每日已可產煤一萬噸，以之運濟平津京滬足維現狀。京滬沿綫戰前每月用煤最低數約爲二十四萬噸，戰後大部工廠未復工，現每月運濟十二萬噸。再加之淮南煤礦可能供給之煤，京滬各地用煤之困難，可望日形减少。共軍目前破路毀礦之結果，雖足妨礙政府復員計劃於一時，然已斷喪國力，塗炭生靈於不知不覺中矣。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾自渝抵滬　行前曾與宋院長重要商談　來滬任務及赴平均未宣佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美駐華特使馬歇爾，於昨日下午自渝飛抵此間。馬氏此次來滬，事前此間未接到任何通知，故知者甚鮮，我官方亦祇於昨晚始得到馬氏來滬消息。馬氏此行任務亦未宣佈，據聯合社息：馬氏昨晚曾與美駐華戰區司令魏德邁將軍，在魏氏私寓會談。又悉：馬氏在離渝前數小時中，曾接見宋子文院長，有所商談。本市各界對馬氏行踪甚爲注意，昨晨魏德邁將軍招待記者時，各記者曾訊及馬氏是否凖備來滬，當時魏氏答稱：對馬氏行踪未有所聞。今晨北平軍事調處執行部招待記者時，記者亦以馬氏是否去平訊諸美代表羅賓遜，羅氏答稱：未悉馬氏有無來平計劃。本報記者昨晚遍詢有關各方，皆未能透露馬氏來滬之任務，及是否將　平一行。昨晚聯合社息：馬氏今晨將在華懋飯店招待記者，關於此點，本報記者亦未能正式證實。</p>

<h3>傳印度禁用　大票面盧比　滇金融界震動</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明十八日電〕近數年來印度盧比大量流入滇省票額百元，五百元，千元，及萬元者幾佔多數，昆市近傳印度中央政府禁用鉅額盧比，致使金融界人士極度疑懼，金融市塲幾因此而紊亂。省市商會今特會商對策，除派員向英駐滇領署詢明實情外，並請我外交部注意交涉，希望該項禁令不影響國外之巨額盧比。關於該項禁令之內容，據悉如次：印度中央政府十二日通過一法案，自即日起禁止票額五百元，千元及萬元盧比流通，持有該項鈔票之銀行及公庫，應在本星期六下午三時以前，向聯合準備銀行易取票額百元盧比之鈔票。至於持有該項鈔票在百萬盧比以下者之普通人士，應在十天之內向任何銀行或公庫申請易取低額鈔票，申請書　應書明姓名，職業，地址及所屬之所得稅區，每日收全數目擁有該項鈔票之理由等項，以便政府派員調查，如持有者因故不能親赴銀行或公庫時，可在十四日之內，以保險信致函孟買，加爾各答及馬特拉斯三地聯合準備銀行申請。凡申請交換數目在百萬盧比以上者，必須向此三地聯合準備銀行申請，如有謊報者，將受三年以上之監禁或予以罰款。據聞印度政府此舉主要目的，在肅淸黑市，嚴防游資作祟，此項禁令是否適用於國外，尚未加以說明。</p>

<h3>戰火鎗聲下座談　調處部招待記者發表聲明羅賓遜說走一步講一步罷</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕幾處戰火的餘燼，現在正考騐着停止衝突命令的神聖性。在昨天，調處執行部舉行的招待記者會上，營口和赤峯戰火槍聲，成了討論的中心。某外記者問共軍是否已攻佔營口，葉劍英說，他沒有接到關於該方面情形的報告。另一中國記者問，假定共軍進佔營口是確實的，葉先生將採何種措置，熄滅這戰爭之火。葉劍英的答覆，仍然是未得報告，無從答覆，並沒有作一個假定的回答。美方委員羅賓遜，明白宣稱，東北不在執行部的工作範團以內。一位記者問，如果東北的軍事衝突影響到執行部管區以內怎麼辦呢，羅賓遜輕輕的嘆息了一下：一走一步，講一步罷！」杜聿明將軍所部的行動，也成了外國記者注意的另一中心，紛紛問在停止衝突令下後，杜部是否仍繼續前進。鄭介民委員的回答是：「沒有前進，十六日我們曾派飛機去偵察過。」葉劍英委員則肯定指出杜聿明將軍部隊，目前距赤峯僅二十里，在中共是否已普遍下達停止衝突命令的詢問下，葉表示在雙方簽字後，延安即立時將停止衝突命令發出，但是就在這時戰火依然燎原。根據鄭委員報告，平古綫·古北口·平綏綫的集寗，平漢綫的元氏，都有激烈的衝突。津浦綫的臨城·泰安·棗莊·膠濟綫的濰縣，隴海綫的黃口，都可以聽到槍聲。葉劍英報告的衝突地區，更爲廣大，他說：幾乎所有國共軍同時存在的地區，衝突都在繼續。這廣大的區域，包括賀龍將軍所在的晉綏區，　榮臻所在的晉冀察邊區，劉伯誠所在的晉豫魯邊區，陳毅所在的蘇北區，李先念所在的豫鄂皖邊區，鄭三所在的廣東區，馮伯奇所在的海南島區。他準備把各地衝突的情形報告三人委會。關于如何停止衝突，除了利用飛機，前往衝突地點，散放傳單，和派遣三方人員前往調處外，鄭委員說，今天大家還商量有三個辦法，但又不曾宣布是什麼辦法。停止衝突地區行政如何處理，也有記者問到，葉答，由三人小組處理。至於受降及運送戰俘有關事宜，葉答，此種工作，執行部尚未開始處理。偽軍問題，鄭委員聲明，這不是他的職權以內所應當答覆的，但以私人所知，爲數的五十萬的江南僞軍，業已解散；上校以上的軍官，即依法審判。華北區餘下的僞軍不多，因爲國共尚在衝突，所以還未能執行繳械。談到恢復交通，鄭委員認爲必須等停止衝突命令切實作到後，方能談到，葉劍英也抱同感。美方委員羅賓遜的答記者問要點：（一）說明美方人員，在執行部居中立地位，其任務在帮助重慶延安雙方達到停戰方案的要求，所有一切決定，都是渝延雙方的決議，而非美方的決議。在解決紛爭上，國共雙方已在渝成立協議，執行部即在該協議下執行工作，所有一切決定，皆經三方同意之意見，美方無疑義。（二）如果雙方有糾紛，而且在繼續，應如何使其停止，對於這個問題，他的回答是：「我沒有辦法，那要看鄭葉兩委員了。」一個半小時的新聞會議，在北京飯店的小客廳裏舉行，四十位的中外記者，擁擠得無法走動。執行部人員坐在前面，漂亮的葉劍英將軍坐在長沙發的左端，鄭坐右端，羅賓遜居中。廳前壁上畫着一張大油畫：「燦爛的落日，快要下海，西沉了，海邊靜的村落上，辛苦一天的老牛，停止工作，悠閒的搖着尾巴在吃草，」但是受了八年苦的中國人民，在勝利後連喘息的時間都沒有呀。</p>
<h3>發表共同聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十八日電〕十八日下午四時，軍事調處執行部招待記者會中，鄭葉羅三委員，共同發表書面談話如次：</p>
<p>根據八日前在重慶協商停止衝突之協議，執行部已在北平成立，協議中規定執行部將由三委員合組而成，一代表國民政府，一代表中國共產黨，另一代表美國。</p>
<p>本執行部業已奉令負責履行停止衝突，恢復交通綫，迅速結束受降工作，遣回戰俘之協議。此令於三委員一致同意後，以國民政府主席之名義發出者。三委員下各設一執行組，平行工作，所有職務，由此三平行工作之執行組，共同計劃執行，並進行使尚未收到停止命令之偏僻區域停戰之各種工作與準備。現已成立之八停戰執行小組，各對其負責範圍中之各據點，發送停戰命令，每小組均由國民政府，中國共產黨，及美國三方面代表組成，彼等并偕有副官及譯員，協同工作，並通訊小組，俾與執行部經常連絡。</p>
<p>所遣小組，在局部衝突地區與交戰雙方，取得聯繫後，即遞出停戰命令，若在發出命令後，仍有繼續衝突情事，並證實糾紛之部隊，確已接到停戰命令，則由小組報告執行部，再由該部將此種實際情形，報告重慶協商當局。</p>
<p>一旦證實停戰及恢復交通之命令確已收到，本執行部之權限，不能超過調查及報告的範圍之外。</p>
<p>在此過程中，尚有甚多困難，必須克服，最嚴重者，厥爲交通工具之不足。中國之交通，經數年戰爭之後，殆全陷混亂狀態，甚多偏僻地區部隊，需要相當時間，始能接得命令。是以衝突事件，可能發生，但如經過調查，確實證明此等衝突係由交通缺乏，停戰命令尚未收到所致，則此等衝突，將不能認爲係破壞停戰協定。吾等由於工作人數之限制，尤其在執行部組織未能完善之今日，更不能對每一衝突地點，派遣小組，對於每一衝突事件，將予以優先調查之權。並在調查可能產生最大裨益之地區，儘先派出小組。</p>
<p>截至現在止，已派出三小組，分赴濟南（山東），集寗（綏省），及赤峯（熱省）。其他小組，正在準備隨時出動。</p>
<p>執行部曾使用美國飛機，在察哈爾，綏遠，熱河，河北及山東之十五個市村鎭，散放傳單。此等傳單中，包括中國國民政府　蔣主席，及中國共產黨毛澤東先生所發之停止衝突命令，必要時散放傳單之飛機，隨時均可出動。此外並曾散放傳單，請求雙方使食糧及商品，自由通過域中。</p>
<p>在過去六日中，三委員及所屬之工作人員，已成立一澈底之工作協議，彼此意見，已趨一致，今後希仍能如此，無庸置疑，吾人將有某種意見之不同，但相信並希望此等不同點，將能在執行部所保有之合作精神下，趨於一致。</p>

<h3>亞塞爾拜然省事件　健康正式提申訴　世界首相人選潘爾遜呼聲最高聯合國大會定下週三開始討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十日上午三時廣播：參加聯合國大會之伊朗代表，今夜採取正式步驟，將亞塞爾拜然糾紛問題向安全理事會提出。伊代表團主任以文件致達聯合國行政秘書詹勃，內稱，「經過嚴密之考慮後，伊朗代表團次請求聯合國秘書長依照聯合國憲章第三十五條，將蘇聯干涉伊朗內政問題，呈請安全理事調查，並作適當之建議，以便解次此項糾紛」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十日上午二時廣播：聯合國行政委員會今日下午組成小組委會，以便就委任聯合國機構秘書長要職一事，進行初步之工作。當下星期三安全理事會開會時，即將討論委任「世界首相」問題，蓋聯合國秘書長一職之重要，實不啻「世界首相」也。可能就此職之人物甚多，但以加拿大駐華盛頓大使潘爾遜呼聲最高。又下星期三經濟與社會理事會亦將召開第一次會議，同時安全理事會將下令召開軍事參謀會議，以便決定五十一國所應獻與聯合國之海陸空軍數量問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫教十八日電〕伊朗代表團，今日就如何與何時將伊蘇糾紛訴諸聯合國大會，討論終日，仍無決議，伊朗發言人宣稱，今晚不致有所決議，明晨將重行會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕伊朗今日以審愼態度宣佈，擬請聯合國安全理事會協助解決伊境蘇聯佔領軍問題，同時蘇聯代表葛洛米柯則在聯合國大會中發表演說，爲安全理事會及聯合國其他機構中大國支配權作有力　護，此事可稱巧合。伊朗官方對於如何向安全理事會申訴，顯屬舉棋不定，並經明白表示，不欲與蘇聯引起無謂糾紛。聯合國方面皆不願公開討論此事，僅有會外接洽。各代表於幕後窺見此事如果達「攤牌」階段，亦可發生嚴重影響。</p>

<h3>維辛斯基　行蹤詭秘　一說曾方土耳其</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕最著名之電影明星，亦不能如聯合國大會蘇聯自席代表維辛斯基之爲人所渴望。自一月十日大會揭幕以來，會場內外但聞「維辛斯基今日能到否」之聲，有謂其已離吳斯科者，有謂其已抵柏林者，有謂又返抵莫斯科者，亦有謂出見於克洛亞東者，甚至官方之塔斯社亦不知其首席代表在伺地逗留，　以機敏見稱之某南美闕家代表，今日　　自權威方面獲悉維辛斯基已搭機離莫斯科，某記者當詢以何時可來倫敦，該代表又曰　並不來此，又飛回莫斯科矣。</p>

<h3>覆法牒文內容公布</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞　華盛頓十八日電〕國務院本日發表國務卿貝爾納斯於一月十三日致法政府之牒文一件如下，該牒文在倫敦，巴黎與華盛頓三處同時公佈「余欣悉法政府已表示願意參加考慮和平條約之會議，並　　　請各有關政府派代表赴巴黎出席會議，因此，余謹以美英蘇三國政府之名義，發表如下之聲明　報告：（一）法政府將獲知外長　會之未來工作，據吾人所知，外長會議之未來任務，即爲波茨坦協定所規定者，惟在和平會議舉行以後，休戰條約各簽字國參考和平會議之建議而草擬最後條約。據法政府來件所稱，波茨坦協定規定準備對德國進行和平之解決方案，莫斯科會議之協定對此點絕無更改之意。此外波茨坦協定並規定各會員政府對外長會議隨時可分派工作，莫斯科會議，對此規定，並無更改。（二）關於法政府來件之第二點，波茨坦協定規定外長會　如遇討論　　他政府有關之問題，即可邀請此等政府之代表出席　莫斯科協定旣無撤消波茨坦協定之意，故外長會議仍得保留邀請有關係國家派代表出席討論之權。（三）在未來之會議中，將舉行廣沃而澈底之討論，並在充分考慮會議之建議後，方着手草擬最後條件，關於此點，法政府可毋庸憂慮，吾人深信最後條約之締立，決不武斷拒絕會議所提出之建議。（四）關於條件對方國家之意見，草擬條約之準備工作，將顧及此等國家之意見并予以充分機會以討論條約及提出意見，相信上項解釋已充分說明會議之工作，希望法政府將證實同意參加此一會議」。</p>
<h3>美對我貸款　三千三百萬元用以購棉經美國進出口銀行批凖</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕美進出口銀行董事長泰勒日昨宣佈：該行董事會業已批准以美金三千三百萬元信用借款，充對華輸出棉花運用資金，此項借款足供運出棉花二十七萬五千包至三十萬包。借款之時限，與去年十月該行貸給歐洲國家之美棉借款大抵相似，唯有一例外，蓋海洋與中國內地運輸所需時間不同，對華之新借款將規定俟棉花運達後二十四個月內償還，而非如對歐洲國家所規定三十五個月。僉信中國所需要者，主要爲纖維較短之棉花。此次借款，與該行過去批准之其他建設借款性質相同，旨在協助復員，加速恢復和年時期狀況。中國對織造設備及勞工並不缺乏，今日世界各地對棉織品之需要頗殷，其主要原因乃英國中國及日本生產方面之損失，其他缺乏棉布製造廠國家所需棉布，泰半胥仰給於上述區域。中國目前所有原棉，不足應大規模織布之需，今獲此新增原棉供給，或可足敷應用。據最近統計，上海一地有紡錠二百三十萬具，華北一百萬具，可供生產棉紗之用。據稱，本年一月一日，上海因缺乏棉花之故，開工之紡錠尚不及一百萬具，在此次棉借款協助之下，今年將有足量原棉使約六十萬紡錠轉動，約可增產棉布五萬萬碼，此數約爲中國戰前每年手織及機織生產總量七分之一，中國棉織業重振後，將减少美國經由聯合國善後救濟總署啓運棉織品至中國救濟之負擔。織造　之重建，尚可减少其他救濟需求，中國就業機會增加後將有裨於中國之國內經濟建設。借款之條件，規定棉花之出口將循美國私營商業之途徑，所有合格之棉花出口商均得利用此項借款。在此次借款限度之內，所有貸款將由核准之中國銀行及中國政府擔保。</p>

<h3>美名將兼外交家　艾森豪威爾　在美京動態</h3>
<p>華盛頓那座巨大的五角大樓，至今還是世界最堅强的軍隊的神經中心，始終以戰時的節奏活動着。整齊的建築裹，空氣帶着之感。命令在這裏迅速而準確地熱行，充滿數字的案卷，由一張桌子，轉到另一張桌子，由一間辦公室，轉到另一間辦公室，這裹遷表現着戰時工作那種熱烈的情形。　此刻對一切起領導作用的，是新任參謀長艾森豪威爾的那種有力的人格。他表示得很明白，當前還有許多艱鉅的問題待解決，都需要着作爲軍人與外交家的材幹綜合運用才行。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統　認爲艾帥正是「我們第一等外交家」</p>
<p>艾森豪威爾將軍，最近繼馬歇爾將軍之後，担任這全國際會軍最高的職位，他的豐功偉續值得永乘不朽。在歐洲勝利的獲得上，他在戰略戰術上起有決定作用，這已是無人置疑的事實。如果還需要提一個最後的證據的話，那末前德國參謀本部幕僚在紐綸堡法庭上說得很明白，使驕傲而强大的第三帝國屈膝的最大因素不是別的，而是艾森豪威爾超人的將才。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統，有一次向一位訪客說過，在他的心目中，艾森豪威爾「正是我們所能有的一等外交家」。總統所以選定他作爲馬歇爾的繼任者，與這一點重要認識一定很有關係，因爲在今後幾個月以至幾年的時間中，如何應付人民，如何排除美國軍事政策上的矛盾與紊亂，實在是參謀總長的主要工作，而美國陸軍，顯然在今後世界大局中將担負一樁從未經歷的重任，其性質，外交的成份自然遠多於備戰的成分。</p>
<p>身負參謀長重任的艾森豪威爾將軍，克盡兩重廣泛的任務：第一，長除了「統轄陸軍」這當然工作以外，他須對有關軍事的一切政策向陸軍部長，總統與國會提供建議。第二，他須負責執行今後陸軍方面確立或專行的政策。他堅持在他顧問職權以內的事，他要有爭辯與異議的權利，但對於業已確立而由他執行的政策，他認爲認眞執行，不置可吾便是他的責任。</p>
<p>陸軍方面所有重要行動與央定，都以參謀總長的名義施行，因此每一項重要決定，最後考慮的責任，就在他的身上。自然這事情牽涉的範圍很廣泛，那麼些複雜的問題（而且不少高度技術性的）都要他衡量與決斷，那是不可能的事情，因此一套日常工作，就顯得非常重要。</p>
<p>艾帥之決心　「如果我不堅信美國　會對世界作最大貢　獻則我只幹五分鐘</p>
<p>在他任職最初幾星期內，許多事情都由他的幕僚加以整理，設法簡素化。他們對艾森豪威爾處理稪雜問題的英明果斷，都一致加以讀揚。</p>
<p>但每天他處理的問題中最大的一個，莫如復員。他已指令幕僚從事研究，以便明瞭問題中最危險的一環是什麼。他注意着美國部隊解散到何種程度，才使軍事上顯露弱點？到什應程度美國將喪失威望以及對世界其他各地秩序與安定的影響？這種安定秩序原由大戰中以重大犧牲換來的。</p>
<p>艾森豪威爾要阻止復員太過，要减消人們對國會『還我孩兒』的嚴重壓迫，必需竭盡他所有的將才與外交手腕，陸軍部的人們，此刻都以爲他一定會積極進行，甚至不惜犧牲他旣得的非常祟高的威望。這一點，可由他就職以後，對他一位幕僚的一段談話證明二</p>
<p>「我們打這次仗，並非爲維持現狀，而是使若干糟糕的景象改好。如果我不堅信一個强大的美國會對世界和平作最大的貢獻，那麼我對於目前的工作，至多只幹五分鐘。」（美譯）</p>
<p>屬歇爾　章，，偕同艾　夫人，前往華盛頓某機塲歡迎艾帥返抵組國之熱烈情形。馬帥〔右立者〕係以軍政代表炎格前去歡迎者</p>
<p>〔上圖〕艾帥返抵美京之日，村專門總統卽在白宮內爲他舉行授勳儀式，在他的衣襟上，挿上「殊勳章」一枚。其旁卽艾帥夫人。民衆歡迎艾帥歸國情況之熱烈，爲美國有史以來所僅見。</p>
<p>〔下圖〕艾帥由巴黎飛返祖國後一日，曾作紐約之行，當他乘汽車駛經熱鬧市中心之際，市民空巷，爭欲一睹將軍風采。將軍爲羣衆熱情所感動，報之以微笑，頷首，抓手，甚至天眞的孩子氣的跳躍姿態，亦於不自覺之間露　無遺。</p>

<h3>陳會員立夫　對國大問題發表見解</h3>
<p>政治協商會議第八次會議中，陳會員立夫對國民大會問題發表意見如下：</p>
<p>關於國民大會問題，聰到各位許多高見，至爲欽佩！本人覺得我們討論這個問題，首先要認淸幾個基本觀念：第一，由一黨政治制度到多黨政治制度之過渡期間，不能抹煞現有一黨的政治制度。有的人以一黨治國的政治制度爲過渡到多黨政治制度的批評對象，於是乎一切事情認爲是錯誤，終至一切問題都不能得到解決了。</p>
<p>從一黨走向多黨</p>
<p>決不能吾定過去事實</p>
<p>中國國民黨自十三年改組迄今，他所領導政府建國的方法，事實上告訴我們，的確是取法蘇聯制度。如果一定要在多黨制度的立場上來批評這一點，當然一切不對的，也就一切問題不易解決了，因爲這兩種制度根本不同。今天我們要從一黨走向多黨，如果絕對否認過去一黨制度的事實，也就不必協商了。在多黨的立場看一切建國事情是權利，在一黨專政的立場看一切建國工作是義務。總之，由一黨轉到多黨這一階段中間，必須認識雙方事實，才能得到公道合理的結論·爲什麼產生這樣的選舉法，自亦有其道理。</p>
<p>不問他是什麼黨</p>
<p>只問他能吾代表國民</p>
<p>國民黨用革命的方法推翻了滿淸，打倒了軍閥，召開國民會議，經國民會議制定的法，在約法內規定，在憲政實施前，由中國國民黨全國代表大會代行國民大會職權，照此規定國民大會召集，憲法制定公佈實行憲政以後，國民黨任務才稱完了，所以國民陳會員立夫大會組織份子，有國民黨中央委員，附合以政權交還人民之意。在我們看，這倒不是一種特權，正相反的，是一種特別義務。從歷史演變產生這種辦法，何況又在交還政權之時，說是代表中不應該有黨員，試問他爲什麼要不惜犧牲洗血去奮鬥，太奇怪了。國民大會代表，不能問是什麼黨不黨，只要是代表國民，如果一個黨不承認他，那末他要奔走於各黨之間，而後可做代表，難乎其爲代表矣。</p>
<p>補救辦法合國情</p>
<p>決不能視爲有違民主</p>
<p>第二，補救辦法正適合中國閘情，並不是不民主，有人認爲假定代表是不民主的，要知中國現在的國情，和歐美文明國家不同，這點從選舉上亦可看出。很多有當選資格而且應該當選的，往往不去競遷，要是沒有補救辦法，必然年　而富於活動性的都當了選，有很好資格而不肯競選的，都不能參加，也是一大缺點。闕民參政會參政員的產生，有甲乙丙丁幾項，其中一項，各用指定方法產生，正所以補救剛才所說的缺陷，因爲中國有許多人，要三顧　才肯出來，雖然站在民主的觀點上，可說是不民主，但從事實方面來看，頗有必要，。國大代表可合理增加　第三，任期的解釋要淸，楚。現在一般人說代表是在十年前選出的，國民大會代表任期是六年，認爲他任期已滿，殊不知任期應從就任之日起算，今國民大會既未召集，他们当然尙未就任，何来任期已满？並没有规定，說是從當選之日起，即是他的任期，國民大會代表應從憲法通過之日起，才是他任期的開始。今天因爲我們對任期的解　模糊，致發生了代表有效無效問題。議民生要不顧到法，此民主是無法無天的。民主的重點，在多數，九百多國大代表，是從各區域選舉產生，他是包括了三萬五千萬以上的人民，他們本身沒有否認他，誰有權取消他的資格，今天絕不是已選代表有效無效的問題，就是如何使闕民大會代表合理增加，更能代表全體人民，對制憲工作，達到更究善的目的，此所以要政治協商，有賴政治方法以解決。</p>
<h3>協商會第八次會議席間　各方辯論白熱化</h3>
<p>政治協商會議於十八晶上午九時舉行第八次會議，原定議程：（一）繼續討論國民大會問題，（二）憲草問題。惟因討論國大問題時間甚久，憲草改明日研討。今日之會，到會員李燭塵等三十四人，雷秘書長報告出席人數後，主席孫科，宣告開會。</p>
<p>羅隆基</p>
<p>氏首先發言，反對國大舊代表有效，據稱，政府之威信與當前實際政治困難要顧到，但新憲法之威信與憲法之理論，亦要顧到，羅氏總批評昨日　王威五·胡霖·传斯年·张萬生諸氏之主張，惟贊同郭沫石·鄧頴超二氏之意見，渠復代表民主同盟提出以下各點：（一）如維持舊代表，則須舉行民意測騐，由工商文化學生等智識份子舉行。（二）以舊代表爲候選人，舉辦複選。（三）不開國民大會，由專家制憲，公民表決。</p>
<p>周恩來</p>
<p>氏繼解釋何謂協商，何謂和諧，何謂政治，解決三點，謂：因有不同意見，故須協商，雖有爭論，但應彼此重視對方意見，聽下了，受得了，尋求共同原則。周氏並謂：承認不承認舊代表，為一回事，中共參加國大，又爲一回事。渠反對承認舊代表。</p>
<p>陳立夫</p>
<p>氏今日首次發言，謂二討論國大問題，首須認淸幾個基本觀念：第一，由一黨政治制度，到多黨政治制度之過渡期間，不能抹殺現有一黨的政治制度，否則一切問題，不能解決，以多黨立場視一切建國工作爲權利，然從一黨專政立場觀之，則認爲義務。第二，選舉法第二條第四項由政府指派代表二百四十人，係一補救辦法，雖非絕對良好，但適合中國國情，因我國與歐美不同，每有當選資格，且應當選者，常自視淸高，不頣競選，故不能不有此辦法，以資補救·第三，代表任期，原文未明白規定，故有争義，有人謂十年以前所選代表，依憲草任期六年之規定，早已屆滿，但不知任期應從就任日起算。今國大尚未召開，進等亦未就任，則任期不但未滿，且實未開始，何況抗戰入年，舊代表之未就任，乃特殊情形。至於憲草尚未依法通過，更不能據以限止代表任期。陳氏最後謂：購民主須顧到法，否則爲無法無天，何能謂民主？過去國大已選代表，皆係由全國各區域產生，如以民主必須取決於多數，則無人有權取消其資格。</p>
<p>吳鐵城</p>
<p>氏對於維持舊代表一點，作補充意見，渠稱：反對舊代表理由，不外兩點：（一）爲廿五年所選代表，不足以代表今日民意，（一）爲當年無選舉權或被選權者，今多已取得，不應剝奪其權利。對第一點當地所選代表，八年來多參加抗戰服務，渠等所得經騐與認識，均已提高，更足以代表民意。對第二點今日取得選舉或被選資格者，究不能超過當年有選舉或被選陰之人數，不應祗爾及少數人之權利，而不承認已得選舉權者之選舉結果。吳氏最後謂：國大問題，不純係理論問題，而是專實問題。</p>
<p>王雲五</p>
<p>氏對羅　基氏意見提出答復，渠認爲民主的基礎係在法治，倘抹殺法律，則此種民主，實不可靠。法治之精神，人民應守法，政府亦應守法，政府不能隨便吾定法律，否則與民主立塲衝突，渠認為國大組織法，有一缺點，即代表無一定任期，又無取消代表資格辦法，渠贊成予以修改。但過去所選代表，不能不維持，渠復强調應廉顧法律與事實，希望國民黨中委當然代表四百六十名名額讓出，容納各黨祇人士參加。王氏又謂：羅氏認爲此等代表，由協商產生，不能取得人民尊重，則將來制定憲法，亦不能取得人民尊重等語，渠表示懷疑，至於民意測騐辦法，僅由智識份子參加，則是否可代表全體一民意，亦屬疑問。</p>
<p>邵從恩</p>
<p>氏稱：渠對此問題，曾費一夜苦思，已另想得一辦法，即由現在起，以三個會議解決此問題：（一）第一個會議，即此次政治協商會議，其任務爲各黨派互相擬定民主開始步驟，起草改正國大組織法及選舉法，乃至憲草大綱，提出一提案。（二）第二個會議，仍照政府之主張五月五日召開，將吾人所改正之組織法及選舉法和憲草，提交該會討論，決定作為正式之組織法選舉法及憲軍。此一會議等於孫中山先生主張之國民會議預備會議，中山先生所提之農工商等九類，亦包括在內，則舊代表之翻不推翻，亦不成爲主要問題。（三）第三個會議，即根據第二個會議決定之組織法選舉法成立之會議，其任務為制憲與行憲。邵氏認爲此項辦法，並不違反　國父遺敎，各方面事實，與將來之憲法前途均可顧到。（明日完）</p>

<p>對國大問題參加辯論的</p>
<p>讀者意見</p>
<h3>民主與軍主</h3>
<p>國民黨說民主，共產黨說民主，各黨各派的人士也都說民主，國內的與論如此，國外的論壇亦莫不如此。總之，時至今日，沒有人說不要民主，不當民主。可是中國爲什麼不能民主呢？對於問題的中心所在，似乎大家尚欠一番認識，這就應當說幾句話了：第一，我要問者何謂民主？道解釋很簡單，就是主權在民，凡是人民都有預聞政治的權利。三民主義的民權主義已說得明白，旣然中國不是君主專制的國家而爲民主共和國，所有人民自當獲得政治的解放。於是第二個問題就是人民怎樣參加政治？一般的方式便是由人民選舉代表，組織議會，成立政府。但是歡美的制度與蘇聯不同，而英美的組織與大陸各國又異，我們到底怎探呢？</p>
<p>英美的政治因爲是大黨組織，某一黨的議會選舉獲得勝利，就由某一黨組織政府。如英國最近勞工黨得勝，保守黨就交出政權，在勞工黨組織內閣·大陸的法國因爲是小黨分立，任何一黨很難在議會中獲得絕對多數，於是不得已只好由數黨聯合，組成聯合政府。而因各教的意見時有不同，所以聯合政府的組織，極不穩定，常須改組重選。英美不然，一黨旣掌有政權，往往可以維持至第二次選舉時，在規定年期中間，除非黨內分裂或發生重大變故，很少不能繼續下去的。這是歐美議會政治國家的民主方式。蘇聯因爲是無產階級專政的國家，所以其所謂蘇維埃者，只有共產黨的代表，非共產黨的代表雖然也有，但但並無另一黨派的組織，有等於無，不能起而組織政府，故政權始終只是在共產黨一黨的手中。這是蘇聯一黨專政國家的「民主政治」方式。</p>
<p>就中國言，國民黨沒有主張一黨專政，（目前的政治乃是過渡時期的訓政辦法），共產黨所要求的也不過是組織聯合政府，照此看來，中國的民主政治應當是歐美各黨並立的議會制度，而不是蘇聯的蘇維埃制度，甚為明白。但是，我們知道歐美各國的議會，是由人民公開選舉代表組織的，在這裏，決定各黨勝負的是其代表的人數，也就是其所獲得人民擁護的選舉票數。這是一種公平的競爭，倘若在這當中，用金錢，那就是賄選，有干法紀的。倘欲憑藉武力，則更不應該。法律規定軍隊屬於國家，非某一然派所能私有，軍人必須解職退伍，始可競選。所以中國今日如欲實行民主，進於盡政的階段，歐美各國的議會選舉，無疑的是我們的好榜樣。</p>
<p>然而中國共產黨的主張則不然。曰：組織聯合政府，參加政權，共產黨須有部長若干人，省主席者十人，軍隊若干師，防地若干區，然後實行選舉。憑了現有的武力，高唱民主，至不惜以國家的八路軍新四軍作爲政治鬥爭之用，這還能說是民主嗎？拆開天窗說亮話，「民主」其名，「軍主」其實！這是封建軍閥要求政府升官發餉的舊手段！這是在今日人民的世紀對於「民主」二字的最大侮辱！</p>
<p>總而言之，共產黨如果有意於民主政治的實現，必須放棄一切争權奪利的主張，把軍隊還給國家的中央政府，纔是正理，吾則便一切都是遁詞巧語。國民黨已聲明召開國民大會，「還政於民」，共產黨爲什麼不能「還軍於國」？共產黨須知世界上絕無以武力爲後盾的選舉，也無以軍隊操縱人民的所謂民主。中闕當前的內亂，其能消弭與吾，決定於共產黨能吾放棄其武力。中國今日的民主，其能實現與吾，也決定於共產黨能否放棄其「軍主」！報載協商會議開得閙熱，我將於是覘之。（陳　）</p>

<h3>我赴暹代表團的使命</h3>
<p>— 葉秋原</p>
<p>我赴遷代表團一行，由國長李鐵錚公使產領，於月初離渝，經昆明河內已於日　前專機飛抵盤谷。暹羅政府當局自國王以以次，對於我代表團之抵達暹京，均表熱誠歡迎與接待，是誠爲中暹關係史上開一新頁。代表團赴暹的任務如何，我們雖尚未看到政府的公布，但據一般觀測，不外敦睦鄰誼，使因日寇的崩潰而造成的遠東新局勢，能就中暹關係的立塲予以調整，以及如何加强中暹兩國間的友誼等等。在國際及國內局勢正在連續展開着重要事態下的今日　，此一代表團的赴暹，或未曾受到它所應受到的注意。然而赴暹代表團所負的使命，却是很重要的。中國在東南亞的新局勢所受的地位與關係，以及中暹關係的促進，都有待於赴暹代表團的努力。茲當代表團行抵暹京之際，願就中暹關係上有所論列。</p>
<p>中國與暹羅唇齒相依，其地華僑在全國人口額中幾占三分之一，中暹關係，素極友善。自日寇企圖造成所謂「大東亞共榮圈」以來，日本即派遣第五縱隊在暹羅大肆活動，一部分暹羅人士自覺或不自覺地中了日本宣傳的毒，風氣所趨，激起了狹隘的民族主義之抬頭，重定其國號曰「泰」，摹擬希特勒「收回失地」的作風，對居留我西甫邊區的夷族人民，特別是在雲南境內的」擺夾」，頗懷歸併親觀之念，會不斷有所煽動。自從遷羅倡導所謂「大泰族」運動以來，中暹關係即處處存着暗礁。迨珍珠港事變起後，「泰國」正式變成了日寇的附庸，唇齒相依的中暹兩國到戰時却成了敵國。在鑾披汶及其徒黨的執政下，暹羅極力排華，我居留在暹羅的僑胞曾遭受到種種的痛苦。凡此均在中遷關係上留下了極不愉快的汚點，日寇接受了波茨坦聲明以後，暹羅亦向聯合國投降；距料當暹羅放下武器之際，鑾披汶的餘黨還復鼓動排華，以致對我居留暹羅之僑胞實施大規模之屠殺刦掠，我僑胞所受生命財產的損失，至爲重大。當時國內輿論，對暹羅之排華運動，無不情緒激昂，要求政府於慰問僑胞之外，向暹羅進行交涉。我國赴暹代表團，便在這種情勢下組成出國，担負起它的重大使命的。</p>
<p>赴暹代表團，係由外交部、僑務委員會、及共它有關方面派員組成。此次赴暹，在暹羅發生排華運動，我僑胞遭受重大損失之際，其所負第一任務，就在慰問信胞，調查事件眞相，以備輿暹政府進行交涉。我居留暹羅僑胞，數達一千萬，其中不少對於國民革命運動，曾立了不可磨滅的業績。如過去的蕭佛成氏，就是一個最代表的人物。迨我被迫興抗敵之師，我留暹僑胞，或則踴躍輸將，或則積極參加抗日工作，對於抗戰，貢獻實鉅。我國民政府對於僑胞的福利素極關注。此次暹羅發生排華運動，我政府旣派代表團赴暹，深信對於死難的僑胞，必將有所昭霉，並將爲我留暹華僑的福利作積極的保陣。代表團之赴暹，就表示政府關懷僑胞福利的至意。我旅暹僑胞，在暹羅過去的暴政下，渡過長期的苦難，對於中央的德意應表感奮，自不待言。願我在　僑胞，秉過去參加革命，參加抗戰之情緒，繼續積極參加建國的大業，方不負政府的期許。</p>
<p>就中暹關係上來說，中暹兩國戰時爲敵，今却爲友。我們深知暹羅的投身「大東亞共榮圈」，原也有不得已的苦衷，以我們存心的寬大，並不想作一個淸算。我國民政府主席曾一再昭告世界，我國在東南亞無領土的野心，此亦包括暹羅在內。因暹羅的參戰，我政府是否應向暹政府索取賠款，這在我政府自有其權衝，不是我們在此地所欲論列到的。不過，我居留暹羅的華僑在戰爭期內及戰後因排華運動而遭受到的損失，暹羅政府自應負賠償之責。同時，鑾披汶徒黨及其它排華運動，暹政府應嚴加取締，庶幾我在暹華僑不致在將來再遭受同樣的損害。而且所有一切含有排華意義之暹羅法律，亦應一律廢止，不再損害我在暹僑胞的法益。凡此，都是因最近暹羅排華運動而引起的必要措施。暹羅政府於戰爭終了之後，倘思自新自效，對此種種，當不難覓取解次的途徑，成立協議。</p>
<p>中暹兩國民族有歷史上的淵源，兩國間的經濟關係又極緊密，本應早已通使，建立正常外交關係。祇以從前有日寇的從中作梗，以致中暹兩國的邦交，迄未正常化，實屬遺憾。現在國際形勢已非昔比，中國對亞洲各民族的態度，迭經蔣主席昭告世界，我們不但無侵略的野心，而且更願以兄長自居，提携亞洲各民族，共謀人類福利，特別是亞洲人民的福利之增進。暹羅與中國過去曾通歲　，亦曾沾染了一些中國文化的遣惠。：今値戰敗復國之曹，尤應與其鄰邦重申舊誼，繼續並發揚光大過去存在着的中暹兩民族間的傳統睦誼。中國的兒女寄居在暹羅者爲數旣達一千萬，我們希望中暹兩國間的正常外交關係能够早日成立，中暹兩國間的關係，不論是文化的，經濟的或是商務的，能够更加緊密起來，此不僅關係中暹兩國間的睦誼，實亦在東亞的繁榮與和平之所繫。</p>
<p>赴暹代表團在團長李鐵錚氏領導之下，前往暹羅，所負使命，實至重要。今日的暹羅已與英國訂立和的，雖曾遭到割地賠償，但是項和約之簽訂，無疑地加强了暹政府的力量。此外，美國的國務卿亦會有對於暹羅的聲明，從而可知暹羅雖曾一度參加軸心爲附庸，今投降復國，，已漸爲國際社會中之一員。團長李鐵錚氏對於亞洲外交，素有經騐，深信此次我代表團的赴暹，必能達成其所負的使命。</p>

<p>又據（大公社訊），本市糧政當局，對於本市民食至為關心，近以陰歷年關將屆，深恐不肖米商乘機抬價，操縱米市，故除出示嚴禁外，並向浙贛湘無常錫等產米區，購妥食米一百五十萬石，該米分批運滬，存儲倉庫中，現已運抵二批，故米價可望輕鬆。又本市麵粉廠復工日多，每日產量已達二萬餘袋，至其原料所需小麥，大多爲聯合國善後救濟總署運滬之麥撥父該廠等代爲磨粉云。</p>
<h3>絲綢漲風略下</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲得悉絲織廠商將請求配給原料，故現貨呈疲，晨盤一二〇號天橋一百三十二萬元，最高做一百三十五六萬元，收盤價一百三十三萬元，較上日回小二萬元，棧單初做九十八萬元，最後做一百〇五萬元，較上日高八萬元，週六下午無市，人心似呈虛軟，廠經因無錫蘭價高昂，成本激增，無貨裝申，價頗堅穩，綢貨榮辱皆有，上落俱微，美亞被面每百條七十八萬元，大誠格　縐每碼二千四百廿元，較上日漲一百廿元，民生織錦緞仍報上日原盤。</p>
<h3>紗花平淡　府綢銷路旺盛</h3>
<p>昨日紗市無榮無辱，細紗及雙股綫織廠仍在採辦中，價與上日相仿，廿支紗去化不多，微降五千元之譜，人心尙定，趨勢平淡之至。</p>
<p>棉市因紗價無甚特色，州兼以年關在邇，廠家與花號商均抱觀望能度，以致全無做開。</p>
<p>襯衫府綢，向以內衣公司爲大宗去路，雖有少數廠商開始自行織造，但泰半內衣公司仍仰賴於染織廠，邇日川幫吸收頗勤，致行情步俏，至藍布及士林，均以廠家有供應額，市勢平穩如常。</p>
<h3>茶價步俏</h3>
<p>茶葉在冬令向爲去化較淡之時期，木屆突一反過去常例，且更比往年活躍，因客帮自各地交通艱難後，久乏順利裝昔，目前去路相縱暢通，各地之需要倍於往者，但特貨者鑒於本市存底稀薄，均不忍脫手，以是價格，在求逾於供下，遂逐步俏利。</p>
<h3>棉美貸款條件</h3>
<p>期限二十四個月餘與對歐洲相同</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕據進出口銀行行長泰勒宣稱，該銀行董事會已核准對華放款三千三百萬美元，以購買美棉二十七萬五千包至三十萬包，此項貸款條件與對歐洲各國美棉貸款之條件大體相同，惟遺還期限爲貨到後二十四個月，而非十五個月，此項期限之寬展，係因太平洋上及中國境內交通狀况與歐洲不同之故。</p>
<h3>五金交易活潑　銅錫漸有轉機</h3>
<p>本月來銅錫五金始終在穩定狀況中，迨最近漸有轉機，行情報漲，目下點錫每老担沽三十萬元，焊錫沽十四萬元，純第沽九萬元，坎拿大靑鉛售四萬元，白鉛售五萬五千元，惟條銅仍舊在三萬元左右。</p>
<p>近日五金交易活潑，行情莫不上升，如元釘馬口鐵鉛絲盤元洋元路皮工字鐵竹節鋼等，皆有成交，價格較週前好起一二成不等。</p>
<h3>柏油現貨缺乏</h3>
<p>柏油銷塲日見其旺，各產地均無現油應市，致無日不在增加。接嘉興通訊，本車柏油已售開二萬七千元，且無現貨。抗州電訊已漲至二萬元，而到不敷銷，各處赴杭蘭等處採辦者，均在等候，不料來源反見凋零，因是現油大感缺乏，故今市本埠行家售本車油三萬元，蘭溪油二萬五千元</p>
<h3>國家擴大放款範圍　可酌做商業放款</h3>
<p>〔聯合徴信所訊〕四聯總處前爲適應抗戰時期金融經濟環境，歷經訂定原則，規定各行局辦理放款，應以協助國防有關及民生必需品之工礦生產事業爲限，三十三年九月間並奉令轉知各行局停做普通商業及行莊貸款與貼現，蓋在戰爭時期，物價騰貴，商業利潤優厚，囤積之風一遍及各地，爲維護工礦生產事業，對於商業放款，自應予以限制，惟自抗戰勝利以來，各大都市物價普遍下跌，所有助長戰時商業囤積之因素，已不存在，而將來國內外交通日趨暢達，工商事業息息相關，工爲表裹，不可偏展，經決定今後各行局放款，應在專業範圍圍內，就右關生產運銷事業，酌予擴大放款業務，並逐漸减低利率，以利金融流通之靈活，聞已通知各國家行局照辦云。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>洋紙市價堅定，客銷活動，存底淺薄，市價一時不易下落。</p>
<p>木材市况，昨頗平穩，聞抗州方面運來杭木的一百兩，每兩計四萬陸千元，已成交，在杭尙有幾千兩碼子，將陸續到滬云。</p>
<p>針織品中菊花汗衫市上頗吃香，價高於上日，大發毛巾廠價六千，大發被單廠價六千八，市上成交價，則為毛巾五千八，被單六千七云。</p>
<p>燒碱美貨續見疲，永利貨因廠盤未見開小，價站穩，牛油貨缺略升。</p>
<p>捲烟紅金牌有派貨，英美烟傳永泰和亦將開派，故行情回小，華商烟則微有參差。</p>

<h3>永紗一路領頭　華股友市況挺秀</h3>
<p>華股昨已移往七樓呌喊，報載證交不日復業，吸引不少，雜行游資，初開即形微挺，中途則因買戶脫手，稍作徘徊，小型股一度回小至前日收市價相近，無如永紗在傳聞發息一八〇元之利買消息下，始終領導爲先，最後各股亦被帶好，永沙且以高價結束，午收較前收計永紗回漲一百三十元，美亞七十元，信和四十元，三小熱各漲半成，冷門各股尙難跟上。</p>
<p>外股受華股所刺激，游資紛來搜購，熱門小型更爲各方垂靑，惟業中人心反見謹愼將事，是以過程不若華股之燦爛，僅稱平穩而已，午收較前收計怡紗升五十元，怡啤七十元，紙業一百元，會德豐一百元，橡皮股亦見向榮。</p>

<p>顧局長開幕詞</p>
<p>首由顧局長致開幕詞，闡揚電化敎育。次舒新城講演：「以耳代目速成建國法」，周要成講述：「廣播敎育之意義」，高爾柏講：「敎育貸金」，四時許，潘主委公展翩然蒞止，略事休息後，即作懇切之廣播，語語沉痛，播音室內之聽衆，莫不泫然涕下。茲錄其演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>潘主委廣播詞</p>
<p>諸位聽眾！今天本人應市敎育會新聲廣潘電台之邀，作勸募敎育助金之呼籲。上海學校雖衆，由於政府經濟之困難，公立學校未能普設。私校亦以敎員生活維艱，不得不酌增學費，近報端所載下學期收費辦法，諒均看到，其所定學費高中最高萬六千元，初中萬二千元，小學八千元，以近日物價與戰前學費相比，可說並未多收，然即此並不巨大學費，試想能担負者有幾？摒諸門外更幾許？渦去申新兩報有貸金之舉辦，千萬淸寒學生得以救濟，嗣兩報貸金均已停止，此後千萬淸寒學生，將如何繼續其學業？諸君亦何能坐視彼等之失學！苟政府經濟如有辦法，則不僅萬人，即十萬人，政府均應責無旁貸，然政府抗戰八年，財政困難，已臻極點，今後百廢待興，在在需款，雖明知「敎育第一」，然較之更重要，更急需者，亦難枚舉，更何暇顧及淸寒學子乎？返觀上海現狀，深感豪華，奢侈甚於戰前，敵僞時發國難財者，天日重光後又發勝利財，囤積居奇，影響所及，莫不風靡，少致富者愈是窮奢極慾，大部貧民則陷於水深火熟，呼號無吿之生活。然此種畸形不合理現象，我敢斷言不會久長，但知利已不救人者，決無好的後果。諸位試想此等備受壓迫，慘遭失學之靑年，能確保不生反饗乎？故深希諸君能本救人即救己之意，廣爲捐助，有錢出錢，有力出力，以爲减輕自已罪愆，同時即爲兒孫積德。今即以斯意廣播，深望諸君能努力贊助。</p>
<h3>來函聲明</h3>
<p>逕啓者：本月十八日貴報刊載消息一則，絕非事實，查敝廠現在之廠房，係向人租用，原業主屢次表示，須收回自用，乃於民國卅二年購置愛文義路五七八，五八四，五八八號房屋，三幢，作爲廠房之用，當請道中女中遷讓出屋，或簽訂租賃合同，道中方面除請日籍敎員嚴拒，復委託偽律師張濯塵濯將一小部份租金提存偽法院，敝廠無法收受，痛苦萬分，自敵人無條件投降後，乃聲請法院調解，竟置不理，復請兪傳鼎律師調解，亦無效果，不得已訴請法院救濟，但爲顧全敎育事業起見，聲請至本年度暑假期內遷讓交屋，此係經過事實，敬請貴報賜予更正爲荷。　明星香水廠</p>

<h3>建國必須建煙　白副參謀總長閱兵訓話</h3>
<p>白崇禧將軍昨抵滬後，於下午檢閱新六軍及靑年軍，對全體官兵訓話。要旨如下：</p>
<p>八年抗戰，終獲勝利，這是統帥的領導有方，和抗戰決策的成功，但也是靠我全體官兵，和盟軍的奮鬥犧牲，用頭顱熱血換來的勝利。在此次世界大戰中，此爲不可泯滅的重大戰果。八年血戰，我們得到了勝利，可是，勝利之後，站在中國前而的還有很多艱難問題。我們必須要完成建軍和建國的工作。建設近代國家，必須建設</p>
<p>近代軍隊　委員長照示我們，要建設近代軍隊，必須：（一）澈底實行「新」「速」「實」三字。我們要新的裝備，新的訓練。用「兵貴神速」，陸軍要機械化。要脚踏實地去做，要「實」，不要虛浮。（二）近代軍隊是建築在科學上的，今後希望每個官兵，對學術方面多加研究。（三）要嚴束紀律，和（四）守法。</p>
<p>此外，新六軍即將奉令開往東北接防。東北之暗礁尙多，新六軍到東北後，必須負起保障東北，保障中國國防的重任。二〇七師是智識靑年軍，委座對靑年從軍，非常愛護</p>
<p>非常重視　最近氣政部敎育部·軍訓部·暨有關各部，曾會議決定，靑年軍改受預備軍官敎育。如果要全國總動員，要實行全面戰爭，必須速立預備軍官軍事制度。所以我準備全國動員，一定要準備多數幹部，二〇七師是第一期預備軍官，是中國歷史上的新紀元。</p>
<p>最後白將軍稱，本人此次奉令到南京時，委員長囑咐木人將其平常對各部隊訓話，皆要轉達給各位。委員長因公不能到每一地處來視察，本人謹代表委座，向各位致慰問之忱。</p>
<h3>駐華美軍將漸減少　顧問團成立有待　魏德邁將軍招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美中國戰區總司令魏德邁將軍，昨日上午十一時半，在華懋飯店八樓，招待本市中外記者。</p>
<p>繼續維持指定政策</p>
<p>關於美軍自華遣歸問題魏將軍稱：美中國戰區司令部及所屬隊伍，軍官士兵在目前數月中，將在華繼續執行任務。有記者訊以中國戰區是否準備依華府最近決定，减少駐防人數，魏將軍答稱：中國戰區司令擬在華繼續維持必需之人數及部隊，以執行華府所指定之政策。魏將軍並稱：退伍之士兵遣回美國後，即將有其他士兵由美來華調替。惟在華美軍總數，則在目前未必有增加之可能。另一記者訊問，華府最近頒佈之復員命令，將如何影響駐華美軍人數，魏將軍答稱：將來美軍駐華人數將逐步减少，以編成駐華軍事顧問團。</p>
<p>魏將軍答覆記者所問，關於美在華軍事顧問團延遲成立之原因謂，美國與中國或其他各國，在此次戰從，均有同樣情形。即須解決許多更重要之國內及國際問題，在時間所不容許之下，對於稍次要之問題不得不稍予延遲。</p>
<p>示威運動勿過重視</p>
<p>某記者問：此次中國學生示成運動，純係因其他原因，然有若干美軍方面人士認爲係反美運動，不知美軍總部方面有吾接得中國當局之解釋？魏將軍稱：並未收獲中國官方，或非官方之聲明。但上星期五美星條報曾著文，指明此次示威運動並非係反美者。魏將軍木人認爲在每一大戰之後，全世界均不免有此類示威運動，吾等可不必視之過於嚴重。而此次各種示成之規模比較前次擴大者，乃因此次戰爭較前規模爲大，此乃表示民意之一，當不可以武力加以遏制。惟如有超越其範圍而搗亂秩序者，則當局不得不予以干涉。</p>
<p>戰前戰後　合作到底</p>
<p>上週有報戲一日戰犯被美軍當局逮捕，本市有俄人數名，因前遭日軍禁於橋頭大厦時，亦曾受該日犯虐待，要求判罪。然據美當局表示，美方僅辦理虐待美軍之事件，他國控吿則不予管制。魏將軍聲明此事不確，美國與其他盟國在戰時合作，在載後亦應合作，以達到世界和平。如不互相合作，則即不能執行聯合國憲章中所規定之和平計劃。魏氏決按戰犯調查規定，處置此事。</p>
<p>請示委長採訪新聞</p>
<p>關於美記者赴瀋陽一帶工作，而曹中國當局拒絕，謂因蘇聯不願美人前去，然中央社記者則仍可通行。被等希望魏將軍能予以協助。魏氏稱：余不但希望美記者能前往，即一切他國記者亦能共同赴東北工作，余將於今日下午電蔣委員長請求。</p>
<p>華北之遊　暫時展緩</p>
<p>有衝突事件發生，魏將軍謂已致函錢市長，願與中國常局繼續合作。蓋以往合作情形甚佳，將來亦當努力維持。中國行政當局措事雖曾有失當或以後亦有失策之處，但其本人對於彼等以極少經騐管理此有極多人口之　大都市，而能有甚良好之成績，深爲贊許及飲　。</p>
<p>審訊日戰犯之日期現尙未決定，惟屆時當可准許新聞記者旁聽。又馬歇爾元帥何時來滬，亦未得悉，俟元帥到後，將舉行記者會一次。</p>
<p>魏將軍近因公務繁忙，華北之行，勢必延　。</p>

<h3>軍車機車互撞　流彈傷人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京路四川路口於昨日午後四時十五分許，有軍用卡車三輛，魚貫而來，適前面一機器脚踏軍，因開放紅燈之際，停止前進，兩軍一掩，致機車翻倒略損，而卡車上士兵擁下，反將乘機車者揪住痛毆，並鳴鎗數饗，適一流彈射中於另一汽車中之司機人徐勇林之胸部，勢殊沉重。後經崗警地來舁送仁濟醫院療治，雖經醫師設法將子彈箝出，惟性命垂危。事後探悉，受傷者係中央銀行之汽車夫。</p>
<p>北四川路淞滬警備司令部門首，於昨晚十一時許，有黑牌汽車一輛，號碼爲一一七六一號，疾駛而行，將一上等士兵姚常興撞倒於地，折斷鼻骨，後經虹口分局崗警馳來將肇禍之汽車帶入分局，受傷者車送醫院施治。</p>
<h3>法商電車工潮　解決　昨全綫恢復行駛　資方發給賞金每人一萬元</h3>
<p>〔木報訊〕法商電車公司自怠工以來，已歷四天，經市黨部社會局調解，工人等為顧全大局起見，於昨晨召開全體職工大會，接受調解。十時半談判吿成，十一時全部電車及公共汽車恢復行駛各綫。其條件爲資方發給工人賞命每名一萬元，於怠工四天期內，則付給工資每名五千元，其餘條件留待以後，繼續談判。</p>

<p>至職工等向該公司大班巨克萊司，於淪陷期間，贈送日方公共汽車十五輛，大引擎五座，及大批汽油·柴油·率胎等物甚夥，此案原定昨日下午一時開庭審訊，職工方面七代表準時前往，惟巨克萊司並未傳到，直至三時一刻，始由檢察官訊問，謂此案性質不屬於地院檢舉處職權範圍，依法向高檢處檢一舉云云，工人等仍擬繼續向高檢處檢舉，並張貼標語，要求政府將法商水電公司收歸國營。</p>
<p>葛克信氏發表談話</p>
<p>昨日社會局葛副局長克信，對於本案，特發表談話如下：查此次工人所提要求。（一）工資問題，本市會決定統一辦法，參酌生活指數增減。（二）年終賞金，已由該公司照舊例辦理，均不應再有要求，此種節外生枝，實屬非是。至工人對於政府上如有檢舉，應遵照法定手續檢同證件，旱請司法機關核辦，不應併爲一談。而公司方面未經當局核准，竟在本局調處時期，擅將電流中斷，亦屬不合。總之，關於勞資糾紛事件，業經市政會議決定，應照勞資爭議處理法辦理。在調處期間，勞資雙方，不得有罷工怠工或停業行爲。嗣後本市不容許有同樣事件發生，吾則當嚴予取締。</p>

<p>本市煤氣因市上缺乏其他燃料，原定每戶二十度之限額，已不足用，市公用局當責成煤氣公司改進辦法，業經核准新辦法規定：煤氣售價，按照成本每度（一百立方呎），國幣一百九十元計算，每戶使用限量自二十度提高至四十五度。過限售價，照原規定减低百分之五十。即凡屬住戶用者，每度依照國幣四元收費原規定每度依照八百元收費）。凡屬工業用者，每度依照國幣七百五十元收費（原規定每度依照一千五百元收費）。因此單位售價，雖較原定額增加百分之九十，而用戶之負担，反見减輕。即以使用量四十五度而論，依照舊定辦法，基本限額爲二十度，其外之二十五度，應照過限售價計算，須付價款共計國幣萬二千元。但在新定之標準下，僅須付國幣八千五百五十元。是項辦法，准自本年一月四日起算。</p>
<h3>華鐵管委會發表　說滬區鐵路近況　又有限車輛維持幹綫交通</h3>
<p>華中鐵路管理委會，昨發表其三閱月來工作情形，及鐵路槪況如下：</p>
<p>交通部因鐵路交通一刻不容間　，於派員接收各地區鐵路，原定有一蘭原則，即爲暫時維持敵僞管理時代之業務區域，分別接收管理。業務機構少一分更張，即使交通之繼續上，少一分延誤。敵偽時代華中鐵道公司，管轄京滬滬杭兩路，津浦南段，江南之南京蕪湘段，浙贛之杭州諸暨段。設有上海·南京·蚌埠·金華四局。接收後，即依此業務區域，加以調整。設華中鐵路管理委員會，取消各局。委員會下設運務工務廠務等處，直接經營京滬滬杭兩路，另設浦徐杭暨南段，各設總管）人，秉承委員會綜理全段事務。而京蕪一續，則交還江南公司自行管理。各綫段中，自以京滬一路，爲最重要，亦爲社會所最注意。頃交通部以各鐵路接收完畢，從行劃分全國織路爲九大區，不日付諸實行。關於京滬區及京滬綫之概況，有加下述。</p>
<p>整頓經過　兩路在未接收前，秩序混亂，站容腐敗，黑帽子凌辱行客，單帮客塞滿車頂，充分表現日寇行將敗亡時。一切廢弛胡閙，此爲盡人皆知者。至於軌道之維持，機車之保養，國人容或以爲日人技術前進，　事認眞，必有可觀之處，其實大發不然。戰前京滬特快，原紙五小時半，而僞「華　」對執通維持之必需工作，即逐年拔臘定額抽挽枕木一事，亦　不注意。時執道枕木。多已損　，非抽換全數三分之一，即十六萬根，不能恢復戰前行車速度。若未將枕木先行換竣，勉强增加速度，必致發生危險。</p>
<p>至於與機車保養，及用煤經濟最關係重要之兩事；（一）熱水洗爐，（二）給水淸潔，則偽「華鐵」完全放棄，視若無覩。兩路各給水站，原均極注意引用「軟性面水」（Surface　Waerr）即未經與土壤過分接　之江水，其含鈣成份甚低，爐管硬積自少，爐管硬積，不但妨碍傳熱，增加煤耗，並且增加爐管局部熟度，减短其壽命，最爲機車保管，及用煤經濟之大敵。即以南京一站論，戰前每年疏濬煤炭港，引用江水維持機車淸潔水源。淪陷以來，八年不濬，全行淤塞，江源旣斷吸用秦淮硬性濁水。故在接收伊始，不但秩序及人事方面，一切烏烟瘴氣，即軌道及機車車輛方面，在技術與保養上，亦復一塌糊塗。</p>
<p>接收後三十日，發動人事改革，將一千數百人最惡劣之黑帽子，於一日內盡行開革，社會稱快。一切恢復秩序工作，得以順利推行。昔日混亂骯髒，已成過去。對於熱水洗爐，及給水工程，亦積極進行。但因機車客車，十分缺乏，故客運擁擠，仍未稍减。十六萬根枕木，必須來自外洋，故一時亦無從恢復戰前行車速度。</p>
<p>僞「華鐵」時代業務廢弛，車次甚少。陳特派員伯莊於九月二十日奉何總司令命令，實行軍事接管後，立即增加車次。於京滬滬抗各加四等列車一對，疏遝單帮。並加滬錫區間一對。十月一日委員會正式成立後，雖軍運極繁，仍陸續增加車次。京滬機接收前，日開十列，現十八列。滬杭綫接收前，日開四列，現八列。京滬路即在戰前已爲客運最繁忙之路，勝利後由於種種原因，客運比戰前竟超百分之四十四。現所有車輛雖已全部使用，仍屬供不應求。現時平均每一車輛所載客數，等於戰前兩輛半，造成站上及車中擁擠情形。如欲恢復舊觀，非有大量新車輛輸入不可，實非路政常局所能爲力。三個月來京滬客運與戰前比較，其統計如次：</p>
<p>現當局已依救濟法案，請求交通部從速撥給機車車輛，以期早日恢復舊觀，並謀改進。</p>
<p>提高待遇　搞戰又來，一切交通事業從業員工待遇均苦，而尤以鐵路收支太不相抵，因而員工薪資，較他項交通事業允薄。現行交通部所定鐵路員司待遇及技工待遇，實與京滬一帶，生活程度相差頗遠。其所以然者，〔一〕該項待遇標準，乃依據粵漢湘桂隴海等路情形而定。〔二〕任何行政或業務機關，所定待遇辦法，總跟不上實際物價變動，不特鐵路爲然。而且格於規章，於無辦法中求辦法，削足遷履之處，往往而有。而尤以鐵路技工資，不能照員司加成爲六十倍，圾令京滬當局感覺困難。十月接收時，曾奉交通部長面諭，暫發生活費，俟部定待遇頒行後照辦。十一月奉到部頒辦法，深感與實際情形，過於脫節。一方面於三個月內，陸續發生活費五次。一方面對於實施部章，詳加研究。部定技工分甲乙丙三等，不但等次嫌少，而且一切照章計算之津貼總起來，其最高額亦不過一萬四千餘元。員司中司事階級人數最多，亦不過一萬八千餘元，實太不數實需。故毅然決然於部章許可之外，暫定臨時補助費。除呈部候核外，即行放發。例如：此項臨時補助費，自冀部方批准。但部定規章，所用計算方法，總覺過於瑣碎，且難合實際。聞擬將於鐵路會鐵，另提員工待遇新案云。</p>
<p>目前計劃　此次全國鐵路劃分九區，所採原則為幹線區制。京滬區鐵路包括京滬滬杭甬以及江南京贛，共戰前四路，連貫江浙皖贛四省。東在抗州錢塘大橋，西在江西貴溪，與浙贛路相接。自上海至貴溪，將爲京滬一區，南通粵漢，西通湘黔，北轉四川之幹線。戰前京贛已築至徽州，從徽州至貴溪之土石方工程亦已完成百分之八十至三數十不等。此區鐵路經敵僞拆去者，有甬段，蘇嘉段，江南京贛亦被拆，僅留南京至蕪湖一段。現在京過路當路已奉交通部命令，籌劃本區之復員與重修計劃，不日提出鐵路會議，聞其大體要點爲：（一）恢復戰前京滬滬杭甬兩路設備及行車速度。（二）於本年修復江南京贛至貴溪，使成爲修復贛境內浙贛路之運輸線，以促進交通復員及救濟物炎轉運云。</p>

<h3>國產古裝電影與地方</h3>
<p>— 唐紹華</p>
<p>一件奇怪的事情被人們看慣了，便成平凡。</p>
<p>但從平凡事件中，我們若覺得看不慣便也能化腐臭爲神奇；別人皆習而不察，安之若紫，而我們則以爲那是奇怪已極。</p>
<p>新小說還沒有流行，大家看的是才子佳人的舊小設，於是男的學做詩，喝酒嫖姑娘，又為那是名士風流——名士與才子是同實而異名。瓜皮帽，綢掛，雙鼻緞鞋，白襪，要緊的，還在被脚上綁一根飄帶，走起路來，儼然關關濁世佳公子。女的便要縣在深閨，祗許偸偸地躱在窗子背後，擔開一縫珠簾，物色白天在路上經過的才子。要是看中了，就「偶然」掉落一個扇，或者是一首詩，的在後花園相會，但相見時，又沒有話說，抹抹眼涙又各自回去做詩了。</p>
<p>新文學抬頭，才子佳人也跟着革命。詩是改做新詩，酒是用香檳白蘭地……最復雜的遷心理上的改革，玫瑰花代替紅豆，做了　情的象徴；後花園也被充公，變做公園了。在公園裏見面的情形，便不只是月光與淚痕，有時也用跪（外國式的），擁抱接吻等等。理想的佳人，不是蒼白的，工愁善病的，而才子也改着西裝，同時還配上一副與穿西裝應有的姿態。</p>
<p>說到這種新姿勢，歷來翻譯的小說就沒有交代明白，要學樣，幸好，有好莱塢的電影。</p>
<p>新小設養成了新的才子佳人的「摩登」心理；而舶來電影就在指導新靑年的外觀。于是沒有出過國門的，拿刀叉的姿勢都比道地的外國老太婆慣熟，而佳人們有時也有學錯了的，比如把參加高貴晚會時用的白狐外套，就在白天裏披着，挽起一個才子在灰屢滿天的十字街頭零食吃……</p>
<p>這些只要你看慣了，便也不足爲奇；因爲大家讀的一樣的小說，看的一樣的電影。</p>
<p>有一天，走進沒有看過這些電影和小說的一羣中，便會奇怪他們動作的姿態，有著許多不同。這不同的姿態眞是描摹不盡，比如說，擠眉弄眼，指點一件東西，伸出食指之外，而小指頭也跟着伸出；高興或不高興時，都扭一扭腰，擺一擺屁股，把手帕一角咬在嘴唇上，眼角窺着脚尖……</p>
<p>這姿態或者是老祖母手裏傳下來的，但是老祖母那裏學來的這個樣兒呢？看慣了，不足爲奇，便也沒有人去理會。</p>
<p>偶然踏進地方戲的戲館裏，看見麗上出來了許多半男不女的歷史中人，（因爲演的是歷史劇）他們的動作姿態，說話聲音却正是老祖母一代的東西；因了地方戲，我們自然又想到了國產的占裝電影，那些國產占裝彩片上所表演的不也正是祖母一代的情來電影有也的門徒，國產古裝電影與地方戲也有他的門徒，或者是他們的學派不同，所以學風（？）也大大的不一樣了。</p>
<p>究竟那一種是好？大家各自看慣了，便也都不覺得奇怪，再也懶去理會。</p>
<p>不過若嫌老祖母那一代的樣子，不够摩登，我倒又為改良國產電影與地方戲，不但要就其內容上加以改造，使那些看式的才子佳人心理，變得更現實更堅强一點趕上時代，同時，那種扭扭捏捏的怪模怪樣，也須大加澈澄淸，以合新國民應有大大方方的外觀之要求。</p>
<p>至於贈玫瑰開香檳之類，新文學與電影，注憲的人多，這裏便不多說了。</p>
<p>已主的風氣　「中電」劇團全體大會記實　箴</p>
<h3>民主的風氣</h3>
<p>— 箴</p>
<p>「中電」劇團全體到齊了，同時在上海還吸收了幾位演員，在十五日那天下午，「中電」舉行了一個全體大會，集中新舊兩路英雄，商討到滬後一切問題。</p>
<p>地點是在海格路中央電影塲總管理處，稍過二點鐘，除了住在那裘的從重慶來的人馬外，新加入的沈浩·碧雲沙莉·林彬·路珊·馮喆·英郁·楊英梧，也都陸續到來。原來是放映室，現在改做排演間的臨時會議室裏排好了丁字形的會議桌，白桌布，瓶花，還有許多可口的西點，瓜子，花生之類，三十餘人很擠的坐滿了。</p>
<p>「中電」劇團的秘書張駿祥首先站起來，宣佈召開這個會議的意義。他先說：「原不準備有茶點，可是經了一些饞嘴們的要求，而預備一些，即然有了，現在就不得不客氣一聲，簡陋得很！然後，纔言歸正傳，設這次開會的目的有三點，第一，有一批上海的新同事參加我們這個團體，這些人羅先生或者已經知這，或者還沒有見過，在這裏，給羅先生介紹這幾位新同事，第二，我們新舊同事也都可以認識一下，以後工作可以便利些，第三點，爲了解決我們生活上的困難，調劑生活上的單調，保持生活的規律，我們過有生活委員會，爲了商討演出方面的事項，提高我們藝術修養，我們過去有藝術委員會，現在一則我們原來的委員任期已滿了，再則我們又換了一個新環境，在組織方面以及人選方面，都要在這裏另外決定推選；現在先請羅先生給我們說幾句話。」</p>
<p>坐在張駿祥旁邊的「中電」總負責人羅學濂先生，應時地站了起來，他穿着家常的棉抱，一個和藹可親的樣子，逈不是出出席什麼正常議會那種一本正經的情態，他先向張駿祥問道：「你要我說些什麼呢？」張駿祥答：「你隨便說什麼好了」大家哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>羅先生話家常似的，先說「中電」人馬，這次零零星星的到上海來，一路很是辛苦，我在這裏表示慰勞，另外是我歡迎各位新同事參加我們的團體，後來他又考慮了一番，然後他又說，我在這裏提一提今後我的作風和作法，這或許就是張先生要我說的吧！</p>
<p>「第一，我對事沒有成見，這不是設我沒有方針，方針是有的事實上能够做到那一部我就做到那一步，「中電」劇團的產生，是在電影拍片沒法工作的時候，利用電影工作的人才，來從事於話劇，當時這種做法是對的，可是現在還要這樣做，那就不對了，電影與話劇，各有它不同的特點，劇團的組織系統與工作範圍以後要與電影方面全部分開，一各自單獨發展。</p>
<p>「第二，關於技術方面，與電影如何劃分，道不是指舞臺裝置，燈光之類技術設，而是與電影部門劃分的技術，劇團過去是附屬於機關，今後希望，勉强說吧！是成爲職業化的，這意思就是說不再像一個衙門了，換一句話說，要能够自給自足，辦到自給自足的一切條件，我供給你們，我不需要賺錢，但我也不需要賠本，劇團如有盈餘仍是大家的，這就是說劇團的盈餘要用於發達劇團，以及保障各位的生活，實行的時候，我與各位一樣負擔解決各種問題，我希望，我怎麼做，各位也跟我一樣地做，當然如果我不好，各位可以說我。</p>
<p>「第三，我得申明我自己的地位，我抄用萬家寳先生的話，我是個「橋「，我願意做橋，一切責任歸我負，可是做起來，就要各位努力了，關於「中電」各方面，我都有計劃，都有部署，上海劇團方面，我希望張先生多負點責，實際上張先生已經這樣做了。</p>
<p>附帶再提一提，無論什麼人或什麼團體，都有長處，也都有短處，希望各位都盡力發展長處，而且，只是各人獨自發展各人的長處，還是不够的，一定要把各人的長處的成爲劇團長處，我們才能站得住脚，七八年來大家都有很好的表現，將來也一定如此，無論新同事舊同事都是一樣，老實說一句，我們劇團是很有希望的。</p>
<p>羅先生設完了，仍由張駿祥站起來，他很風趣的說，「羅先生事情很忙，要我多分點責任，羅先生是「橋」，我不過是橋頭上的M.P.守着各位坐着汽車、吉普，摩托車過去」。</p>
<p>張駿祥先介紹了「劇團」中工作上必須先認識的幾位，然而由劇務劉厚生介紹了來滬的其餘諸人，楊英梧爲介紹了新加入各位，接着進入討論成立生活及藝術的委員的階段，羅先生先行退席了。</p>
<p>在熱烈與自由的氣氛下，決定了，「生活委員會」仍按照重慶舊制略加修改，總稱「中電村」各體團員即爲材員，享受一切權利，供獻一切義務，全村最高領袖爲主席，下設秘書，醫務，圖書，交際，體育音樂等單位，張駿祥當選爲「體育」組，而並不是「中電村」的當然主席，可知他們是很民主的了，跟着又選舉藝術委員會，除了實際上負責演出上各種工作的爲常然委員，另有五個村民代表共同決定一切藝術方面的問題，這些都是僅於「中電」內部有關的支節，這裏不再累累贅贅地介紹了，只是這種新的風氣很足以是劇影界的參考而已。</p>
<h3>吳永剛蔡楚生　先後到滬</h3>
<p>名導演吳永剛蔡楚生在抗戰期間曾自港轉入內地，參加中央電影攝影塲任導演。頃已先後到滬，兩氏在滬均有家，故一抵滬後，便各到自己的家裹去了，聞兩氏均在積極籌備新作品之攝製云。</p>
<h3>「清宮外史」</h3>
<p>— 鈕乙</p>
<p>在內地，楊村彬的「淸宮外史」是幾年來賣座最盛的一部話劇。</p>
<p>「淸宮外史」第一部「光緒親政記」，以光緒初握政權，慈禧太后幕後操縱專橫的史蹟作題材。表面上和在上海演出過的姚克的「淸宮怨」取材有點相彷，但前者對光緒和珍妃間的羅曼史叙述較少，比較更着重於表現當時的政治形勢，如對日的「戰」「和」之學，革命勢力的伸張等。結構的緊密生動，和滿人口語的巧妙運用，是該劇的突出點。</p>
<p>這一齣戲，聰說「苦幹」最近要上演，大槪繼「夜店」之後，在廢曆新年前後。在上海的觀衆也有機會欣賞它了。</p>
<p>「淸宮外史」人物很多，其中主要角色如慈禧，李蓮英，光緒等已決定由丹尼，石揮，張伐等飾演外，遠去重慶的沈敏據說也將於廢曆新年之前趕回上海，參加演出。這又是一個喜訊。</p>
<h3>介紹「長空萬里」</h3>
<p>— 芬</p>
<p>抗戰期間在後方有一部最偉大的出品，就是「中電」的「長空萬里」，此片是詩人導演孫瑜的作品，叙述中國空軍之誕生成長與其鬥爭史，是一首血淋淋的悲壯詩篇，演員有白楊，王人美，金燄，魏鶴齡，顧而已，施超，丹凝等，此處刊印的兩幀銅版，是該片的兩幕，與上海人士闊別了八年的白楊，金燄等紅星，不久就可在本市兩大戲院與本市人士重聚了。</p>

<h3>Heated Discussion on the Draft Constitution; Sun Ke States Amendments Can Be Accommodated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] The Political Consultative Conference, held since the 10th, has convened nine times as of the 19th. The five categories of issues slated for discussion have now been fully deliberated. The conference will adjourn for one day tomorrow, Sunday. The tenth meeting will be scheduled after the subcommittees have completed their consultations.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The Policy Guidelines Group of the Consultative Conference's subcommittee convened a meeting at the Supreme National Defense Council at 3 PM today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 19th] Various subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference are currently immersed in studying various issues, the most important of which are: (1) the reorganization and nationalization of the army, with the Communist Party demanding that this be carried out simultaneously with the government's demobilization plan; (2) the formation of a State Council, with the number of members limited to one-third; (3) the issue of convening the National Assembly in Nanjing on May 5th; (4) the constitutional issue, with the Communist Party demanding the adoption of a cabinet system along the lines of the American and British models.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] The ninth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference was held at 9 AM on the 19th to discuss the draft constitution. First, government representative Sun Ke explained the content and spirit of the May 5th Draft Constitution. Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Fu Sinian, Hu Lin, Zeng Qi, Yang Yongjun, Zhang Shenfu, Wu Yuzhang, Li Zhuchen, and others then spoke in succession. The meeting was chaired by Sun Ke, with Secretary-General Lei reporting the attendance of 32 members including Yu Jiaju, et al. Member Sun Ke, in his capacity as a government representative, explained the May 5th Draft Constitution, elaborating on (1) political power and governing power, (2) the National Assembly, (3) the five-yuan system, (4) the presidential system, (5) the local system, and (6) the rights and freedoms of the people, point by point. Sun stated that amendments to the draft constitution would be accommodated. (Sun Ke's original statement will be continued on the third page tomorrow.)</p>
<p>Huang Yanpei, based on his experience in participating in the Constitutional Government Preparatory Committee and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, believed that the May 5th Draft Constitution needed to be re-examined. He stated that the review of the draft constitution should be approached with a calm, absolutely objective, and forward-looking attitude. He then summarized the opinions of various parties on the content of the draft constitution and listed issues that should be considered, such as: (1) legal restrictions on the rights of the people, (2) specific provisions for gender equality, (3) a three-yuan system, (4) the powers of the president and the issue of the vice president and premier, (5) the popular election of provincial governors. He agreed with Hu Lin's proposal to establish a constitutional drafting committee and hire experts for detailed study.</p>
<p>Shen Junru then spoke, emphasizing the issue of local political power. He detailed his participation in the drafting of the Temple of Heaven Constitution in the past, and his proposals on the issue of the local system at that time, and finally mentioned the tenth item of the Minutes of the Talks between the Government and the CCP Representatives, "On the Issue of Liberating Local Governments." He stated that it should be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion and believed that the "historical contribution to the War of Resistance" and the "political progressiveness" of the CCP areas should be recognized. The content of the draft constitution should be left to group discussion.</p>
<h3>Propose the Establishment of a Review Committee; The Five-Yuan System and the Status of Provinces Should Be Considered</h3>
<p>Fu Sinian said: The May 5th Draft Constitution was drafted based on the essence of the five-power constitution. Since this constitution is a constitution based on the Three Principles of the People, it should reflect the thoroughness of the Three Principles of the People, but its content does not have special provisions for the exercise of civil rights and the problems of various ethnic minorities in the country. Regarding the National Assembly issue, he believed that this system needs to be amended due to changes in the times. He suggested that if the five-yuan system is still adopted, the Legislative Yuan can be used as the lower house and the Control Yuan as the upper house, using the parliamentary powers of the bicameral system of various countries. The names of the two houses can remain the same, but the powers can be expanded. There is no need to have the name of a parliament, but there is the reality of a parliament. A part of the legislators are elected by the National Assembly, and most are directly elected by the people, and the supervisors are elected by the provincial assemblies. In this way, the principles of the five-power constitution can be accepted on the one hand, and the bicameral parliamentary system can be implemented on the other hand. Fu also believed that the provinces should be adjusted, but opposed provincial autonomy.</p>
<p>Hu Lin said: Not only do the Chinese people not oppose the Three Principles of the People, but scholars around the world cannot think it is wrong, but the rules for its application should be considered. We respect the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, but there is no need to stick to the form. Hu also said: There are many places in the May 5th Draft Constitution that can be discussed. For example, the National Assembly issue should be established by us, and it is necessary to consider it carefully, because its powers can be exercised by the Legislative Yuan, so why this huge institutional form. For the rights of initiative and referendum, he reiterated yesterday's suggestion that the Political Consultative Conference or the government should establish a constitutional draft review committee to study it, the number of people should not be too large, and it should be completed within three or four months.</p>
<p>Zeng Qi said: The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, so it has its dignity. He advocated organizing a constitutional draft review committee. He believes that the nature of the constitution should be flexible, and a cabinet system should be adopted. The two-house and five-yuan systems can only preserve their spirit, and there is no need to stick to the form. The provincial system should adopt the principle of balanced power and determine the autonomous status of the provinces.</p>
<p>Yang Yongjun made his first speech today, saying that local governments should be more important than the central government, and autonomy should be dedicated to administration. He also emphasized that the province should be the highest autonomous unit, with provincial governors elected by the people, and that the balanced power system between the central government and the province should be determined.</p>
<p>Zhang Shenfu put forward three principles: (1) The draft constitution must be revised to be in line with national conditions, national history, and world trends. (2) Not only should the present be taken into account, but the future should also be opened up. (3) The rights of the people should not be restricted, and they should be given free opportunities.</p>
<p>Wu Yuzhang said: The fundamental policy of the constitution should be based on the principle of building the country on the Three Principles of the People, and adapt to world trends and the situation in China. This is everyone's hope. The great spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen should also be well incorporated into the constitution. He then put forward the following principles: (1) To protect the rights of the people, ordinary laws should not be used to restrict them. (2) Regarding the powers of the central and local governments, adopt Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of balanced power. The five-yuan system divides power, which is almost equal to no power, resulting in too much presidential power. Wu also said: The most democratic countries in the world are Britain and the United States. We can adopt the parliamentary system of Britain and the United States in the future, but we must refer to the actual situation in our country. (3) On the issue of local autonomy, the province is the autonomous unit, and the provincial governor is elected by the people. According to Dr. Sun's teachings, the provincial constitution should be established to allow local areas to develop freely. (4) Determine national policy and stipulate in the constitution that military affairs should adopt a democratic spirit, not a militaristic spirit, so that the military serves the people. Culture and economic aspects should be allowed to develop freely without restrictions. Li Zhuchen said: In the draft constitution, the issue of equalizing land ownership and restricting capital should prioritize the former and then the latter. Li also specifically pointed out that the slogan of attaching importance to national capital and national industry should be emphasized. The chairman then proposed that, as suggested by Zhang Lisheng yesterday, one person should be elected by each party to make a general review of the topics of the past few days. It was decided to raise it after consultation by each group, and the meeting was adjourned temporarily.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Besiege Yanzhou, Forcing the Garrison to Surrender</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 19th] The commander of the Communist troops besieging Yanzhou on the Jinpu Railway, Ye Fei, commander of the Second Column of the New Fourth Army, sent an ultimatum on the 13th, jointly signed by him, Communist Party Political Commissar Lai Chuanzhu, and Deputy Political Commissar Tan Shilong, forcing the defending troops to surrender to the Communist troops. Deputy Commander Li Yannian has telegraphed the Military Commission, asking it to inform the Communist Party负责人 of this absurd situation of the Communist troops and to correct it immediately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] Jinzhou News, since the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist troops have intensified their attacks on the National Army in the Northeast. Such acts of treachery are truly intolerable. According to reports from various sources: (1) The Fourth Detachment of our troops stationed in Jianchang Baoan at Dachuan was surrounded by Communist troops, and more than a thousand people were added on the 16th to launch a fierce siege, attempting to destroy the troops and occupy the area. (2) The road protection troops stationed dozens of kilometers southwest of Paozi Zhangwu were attacked by a brigade of the 3rd Division of the Communist troops, numbering about a thousand people, on the 15th, and the railway was destroyed. (3) The Communist troops in Haicheng attacked our Zhao troops' Liu Division on the 13th and 14th, and destroyed the railway near Panshan and Dahushan on the 14th, and destroyed the railway bridges north of Panshan. In addition, the Fengjiakou Railway, 15 kilometers from Cangxian on the Jinpu Line, was destroyed by the Communist troops for 8,000 meters, and southbound vehicles can no longer reach Cangxian.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao to Go to Nanjing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The National Highway Conference is scheduled to open in Nanjing on the 20th. In addition, Weng Wenhao, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and Qian Changzhao, Vice Chairman of the Resources Committee, are scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Veteran Employees Aged Sixty and Over Granted Temporary Postponement of Retirement</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Orders Both the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Vietnam Railways</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kunming, 18th] The Ministry of Communications previously ordered employees of all directly affiliated railways who were over sixty years of age to voluntarily apply for retirement. Recently, in order to meet the needs of the recovered areas during the repatriation period, it specifically telegraphed the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Bureaus yesterday, approving all employees over sixty years of age to postpone retirement for five years.</p>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand Unemployed Workers in the Boshan and Zichuan Coal Mining Areas; The Extent of Damage to Mining Equipment is Alarming</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] According to a certain mining industrialist who recently came to Nanjing from Qingdao: After the announcement of the ceasefire order, the results of the Communist troops' destruction of the coal mines on the Jiaoji and Jinpu railways are roughly as follows: (1) Most of the mining machines and electrical equipment in the Boshan mining area and Zichuan mining area on the Zhangbo branch line of the Jiaoji Railway have been destroyed by the Communist troops, and a small number have been transported to Guan Water in southern Shandong to hide. There are more than 10,000 unemployed workers, resulting in a serious coal shortage in Qingdao, which is the most convenient place to obtain coal. (2) The mining area belonging to Taixian on the Jinpu Line, the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mine on the Linzao branch line, and the Jiawang District Mine, most of their mine equipment has been destroyed, and thousands of workers have been killed or injured. Zhongxing Company has about 250,000 tons of coal in storage, which is currently impossible to transport out. The coal stored by Zhongxing in Lianyungang is now being transported to Qingdao. If the mining areas along the Pinghan and Pingsui railways destroyed by the Communist troops are included, the extent of the damage is truly appalling. Fortunately, the Jingxing Coal Mine in Jin Province has been taken over and reorganized by the government, and the output of the Kailuan Coal Mine is increasing day by day, and it can now produce 10,000 tons of coal per day, which is enough to maintain the status quo in the transportation to Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. The minimum monthly coal consumption along the Beijing-Shanghai line before the war was about 240,000 tons. After the war, most factories have not resumed work, and only 120,000 tons are transported each month. With the addition of the coal that the Huainan Coal Mine may supply, the difficulty of coal use in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places is expected to gradually decrease. Although the result of the Communist troops' current destruction of roads and mines is enough to hinder the government's repatriation plan for a while, it has unknowingly ruined the national strength and caused untold suffering to the people.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>— Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>From the gate of the National Government to the venue, there are four lines of guards, who are dignified and respectful.</p>
<p>The lounge is comfortably furnished with sofas, braziers, black tea, and many attendants. Attendees' clothes, hats, canes, etc. are taken by them upon entering and sent to the cloakroom.</p>
<p>The "Press Pass" for news reporters is moon white. One side has a photo and the other side has notes: (1) This pass is only for the use of the holder within the specified time, (2) The holder of this pass must not carry weapons, canes, or any other items. (3) If this pass is lost, please notify this office immediately. (4) The holder of this pass must sit in the designated seat and must not move around at will. The "Press Pass" for journalists is Special Number 7.</p>
<p>The Secretariat has produced a "Political Consultative Conference Car Pass" with a red plum blossom pattern. Cars with this pass can drive directly into the gate of the National Government. The reporter did not know this trick on the first day, so he was politely stopped by the guards.</p>
<p>The seven representatives of the Chinese Communist Party: Zhou Enlai is handsome and elegant, holding a green deerskin women's handbag; Wang Ruofei is plump in his Zhongshan suit and woolen coat; Ye Jianying is neat in his military uniform; Lu Dingyi is radiant; Deng Yingchao wears a floral scarf and smiles often; Dong Biwu wears a gray satin robe, which is elegant and generous; Wu Yuzhang wears a leather-collared coat and is energetic. The seven representatives come and go in two cars. A certain attendee joked: They don't look like proletarians at all.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming, a representative of the Democratic League, participated in the out-of-meeting consultation of the Five-Person Group and decided on the agenda, but his speeches on all occasions raised matters outside the agenda. The philosopher is so forgetful.</p>
<p>Zhang Bojun initially wore a tweed Zhongshan suit, changed to a fox fur robe the next day, added a top hat on the third day, and added a cane on the fourth day. The small "props" of the representative are being added every day.</p>
<p>Luo Longji has a hoarse voice. At the fifth meeting, he said "25% tax increase" instead of "25% rent reduction." The professor of political science seems to be less familiar with economic issues.</p>
<p>The four representatives and one secretary of the Youth Party all wear long robes, and Zeng Qi wears a black fleece cap to the meeting.</p>
<p>Zhang Dongsun often walks around in the venue, passing notes, and his pace is as tense as an elementary school student doing gymnastics.</p>
<h3>Marshall Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing; Important Discussions with President Song Before Departure; The Purpose of His Visit to Shanghai and the Trip to Beiping Have Not Been Announced</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall flew to this area from Chongqing yesterday afternoon. This visit to Shanghai by Marshall was not preceded by any notification here, so very few people knew about it. Our officials only received news of Marshall's arrival in Shanghai last night. The purpose of Marshall's trip has also not been announced. According to the United Press, Marshall met with General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. China Theater, at Wedemeyer's private residence last night. It is also learned that Marshall met with President Song Ziwen for discussions a few hours before leaving Chongqing. All sectors of the city are paying close attention to Marshall's whereabouts. When General Wedemeyer hosted reporters yesterday morning, the reporters asked whether Marshall was prepared to come to Shanghai. At that time, Wedemeyer replied that he had not heard anything about Marshall's whereabouts. This morning, when the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters hosted reporters, the reporters also asked the U.S. representative Robinson whether Marshall had any plans to go to Beiping. Robinson replied that he did not know whether Marshall had any plans to go to Beiping. This newspaper's reporter inquired with all relevant parties last night, but no one was able to reveal the purpose of Marshall's visit to Shanghai or whether he would go to Beiping. Last night, the United Press reported that Marshall would host reporters at the Cathay Hotel this morning. This newspaper's reporter was also unable to officially confirm this point.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 19th, broadcast: It is heard that Marshall may go to Beiping to preside over the work of the Mediation Executive Headquarters after a stay of one or two days in Shanghai. Zhou Enlai also said that Marshal Marshall has agreed to serve as a consultant to the Reorganization Committee.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] U.S. Special Envoy to China General Marshall flew from Chongqing to Shanghai by special plane at 3:30 p.m. yesterday and landed at Jiangwan Airport. General Wedemeyer, Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Commander Zhang Xuezhong, Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, and other Chinese and American military and political leaders all went to the airport to welcome him. After getting off the plane, Marshall shook hands with each of the welcomers, and then boarded a car with General Wedemeyer and drove to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest. The military police were on strict alert along the way. It is also learned that in addition to convening senior American generals to hear reports today, Marshall will also attend a tea party to comfort the Allied forces and will hold a press conference at the invitation of Wedemeyer in the near future.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 19th] Nine members of the U.S. Congress arrived in Qingdao today and will go to Shanghai in a few days. It is believed that these nine people are all members of the Naval Affairs Committee. They arrived in Qingdao by plane from Japan and will visit Tianjin and be guests of the U.S. Marines there. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robinson said that their visit to North China has nothing to do with the work of the Mediation Executive Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Rumor of India Banning Large Denomination Rupees; Yunnan Financial Circles in Turmoil</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kunming, 18th] In recent years, a large number of Indian rupees have flowed into Yunnan Province, and denominations of 100, 500, 1,000, and 10,000 rupees account for the majority. Kunming City has recently heard that the Indian central government has banned large denomination rupees, causing extreme fear among people in financial circles, and the financial market is almost in chaos. The provincial and municipal chambers of commerce have held special consultations on countermeasures, in addition to sending personnel to the British Consulate in Yunnan to inquire about the facts, and also asking our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay attention to negotiations, hoping that the ban will not affect the huge amount of rupees overseas. Regarding the content of the ban, it is understood as follows: On the 12th, the Indian central government passed a bill prohibiting the circulation of 500, 1,000, and 10,000 rupee banknotes from now on. Banks and public treasuries holding these banknotes should exchange them for 100 rupee banknotes at the United Reserve Bank before 3:00 p.m. this Saturday. Ordinary people holding these banknotes with a total amount of less than one million rupees should apply to any bank or public treasury for the exchange of lower denomination banknotes within ten days. The application form should state the name, occupation, address, and the income tax area to which they belong, as well as the reasons for owning the banknotes, so that the government can send personnel to investigate. If the holder cannot go to the bank or public treasury in person due to circumstances, they can send an insured letter to the United Reserve Bank in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Madras within 14 days to apply. For applications to exchange amounts above one million rupees, an application must be made to the United Reserve Bank in these three places. Those who make false reports will be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years or fined. It is heard that the main purpose of the Indian government's move is to crack down on the black market and strictly prevent speculative capital. It has not been stated whether this ban applies to foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Mediation Department Continues to Dispatch Three Groups; To Go to Xuzhou and Datong Respectively; Establish a Joint Staff Department to Enforce Orders</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Xuzhou News: After the Communist troops occupying Dongguang between Dezhou and Cangzhou on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, they continued to invade northward.

<h3>Talk Under Gunfire: Mediation Department Hosts Press Conference, Robinson Says "Take It One Step at a Time"</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The embers of several battlefields are now testing the sanctity of the ceasefire order. At yesterday's press conference held by the Mediation Execution Department, the gunfire in Yingkou and Chifeng became the focus of discussion. A foreign reporter asked if the Communist army had captured Yingkou. Ye Jianying said he had not received any reports regarding the situation. Another Chinese reporter asked what measures Mr. Ye would take to extinguish the flames of war if the Communist army did indeed occupy Yingkou. Ye Jianying's response remained that without a report, he could not answer and did not offer a hypothetical response. The American commissioner, Robinson, explicitly stated that the Northeast was not within the scope of the Execution Department's work. When a reporter asked what would happen if the military conflicts in the Northeast affected areas within the Execution Department's jurisdiction, Robinson sighed softly, "Let's take it one step at a time!" The actions of General Du Yuming's troops also became another focus of attention for foreign reporters, who repeatedly asked if Du's troops were still advancing after the ceasefire order. Commissioner Zheng Jiemin replied, "They have not advanced. We sent planes to scout on the 16th." Commissioner Ye Jianying, however, confirmed that General Du Yuming's troops were only twenty *li* from Chifeng. In response to inquiries about whether the Communist Party had universally issued a ceasefire order, Ye stated that Yan'an had immediately issued the ceasefire order after both sides signed it, but even at that moment, the flames of war continued to rage. According to Commissioner Zheng's report, there were fierce conflicts on the Pinggu Line, Gubeikou, the Jining section of the PingSui Line, and Yuanshi on the Pinghan Line. Gunfire could be heard in Lincheng, Tai'an, and Zaozhuang on the Jinpu Line, Weixian on the Jiaoji Line, and Huangkou on the Longhai Line. The conflict areas reported by Ye Jianying were even more extensive. He said that conflicts were continuing in almost all areas where the Nationalists and Communists coexisted. This vast area included the JinSui District where General He Long was located, the JinJiCha Border Region where Rong Zhen was located, the JinYuLu Border Region where Liu Bocheng was located, the Subei District where Chen Yi was located, the YuEWan Border Region where Li Xiannian was located, the Guangdong District where Zheng San was located, and the Hainan Island District where Feng Boqi was located. He planned to report the conflict situations in various regions to the Three-Person Committee. Regarding how to stop the conflicts, in addition to using planes to distribute leaflets in the conflict areas and dispatching tripartite personnel for mediation, Commissioner Zheng said that they had discussed three other methods today, but did not announce what those methods were. When reporters asked how to handle the administration of ceasefire areas, Ye replied that the three-person team would handle it. As for matters related to surrender and the transportation of prisoners of war, Ye replied that the Execution Department had not yet begun to handle this type of work. Regarding the issue of puppet troops, Commissioner Zheng stated that it was not within his authority to answer, but based on his personal knowledge, the 500,000 Jiangnan puppet troops had already been disbanded, and officers above the rank of colonel were being tried according to law. There were not many remaining puppet troops in North China because the Nationalists and Communists were still in conflict, so they had not yet been able to disarm them. When discussing the restoration of transportation, Commissioner Zheng believed that it could only be discussed after the ceasefire order was effectively implemented. Ye Jianying shared the same sentiment. The main points of American Commissioner Robinson's answers to reporters were: (1) To explain that the American personnel in the Execution Department were neutral and that their task was to help both Chongqing and Yan'an achieve the requirements of the ceasefire plan. All decisions were made by Chongqing and Yan'an, not by the United States. In resolving disputes, the Nationalists and Communists had already reached an agreement in Chongqing, and the Execution Department was carrying out its work under that agreement. All decisions were made with the agreement of all three parties, and the United States had no objection. (2) If there were disputes between the two sides and they continued, how could they be stopped? His answer to this question was, "I have no solution. It depends on Commissioners Zheng and Ye." The hour-and-a-half-long press conference was held in a small reception room at the Beijing Hotel, where forty Chinese and foreign reporters were crowded and unable to move. The Execution Department personnel sat in the front, with the handsome General Ye Jianying sitting on the left end of a long sofa, Zheng on the right end, and Robinson in the middle. On the wall in front of the room was a large oil painting: "A brilliant sunset, about to descend into the sea, setting in the west. In a quiet village by the sea, an old ox, having toiled all day, stopped working, leisurely wagging its tail and eating grass." But the Chinese people, who had suffered for eight years, did not even have time to catch their breath after the victory.</p>
<h3>Joint Statement Released</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] At 4 PM on the 18th, Commissioners Zheng, Ye, and Robinson of the Military Mediation Execution Department jointly released the following written statement at a press conference:</p>
<p>Based on the agreement reached in Chongqing eight days ago regarding the cessation of conflict, the Execution Department has been established in Beiping. The agreement stipulates that the Execution Department will be composed of three commissioners: one representing the National Government, one representing the Chinese Communist Party, and one representing the United States.</p>
<p>This Execution Department has been ordered to be responsible for implementing the agreement to cease conflict, restore transportation lines, quickly conclude the surrender process, and repatriate prisoners of war. This order was issued in the name of the Chairman of the National Government after unanimous agreement by the three commissioners. Each of the three commissioners has an executive group working in parallel. All duties are jointly planned and executed by these three parallel executive groups, which are also working to stop the fighting and preparing in isolated areas that have not yet received the ceasefire order. The eight ceasefire executive teams that have now been established are sending ceasefire orders to all strongholds within their respective areas of responsibility. Each team is composed of representatives from the National Government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the United States, and they are accompanied by aides and interpreters to assist in their work and communication teams to maintain constant contact with the Execution Department.</p>
<p>After contacting the fighting parties in the areas of local conflict, the dispatched teams will deliver the ceasefire orders. If conflicts continue after the orders have been issued, and it is confirmed that the troops involved in the disputes have indeed received the ceasefire orders, the teams will report to the Execution Department, which will then report the actual situation to the negotiating authorities in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Once it is confirmed that the orders to cease fire and restore transportation have been received, the authority of this Execution Department shall not extend beyond the scope of investigation and reporting.</p>
<p>In this process, many difficulties must be overcome, the most serious of which is the lack of transportation. After years of war, China's transportation is almost completely chaotic, and it will take a considerable amount of time for troops in many remote areas to receive orders. Therefore, incidents of conflict may occur, but if, after investigation, it is indeed proven that such conflicts are caused by a lack of transportation and that the ceasefire order has not yet been received, then these conflicts shall not be considered a violation of the ceasefire agreement. Due to the limitation of the number of our working personnel, especially at present when the organization of the Executive Department is not yet perfect, we cannot dispatch teams to every conflict site. We will give priority to investigating each conflict event, and dispatch teams to the areas where the investigation may produce the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>As of now, three teams have been dispatched to Jinan (Shandong), Jining (Suiyuan Province), and Chifeng (Rehe Province). Other teams are preparing to depart at any time.</p>
<p>The Execution Department has used American airplanes to scatter leaflets in fifteen cities, towns, and villages in Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe, Hebei, and Shandong. These leaflets include the ceasefire orders issued by Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Chinese National Government, and Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party. If necessary, airplanes scattering leaflets can be dispatched at any time. In addition, leaflets have been distributed requesting both sides to allow food and goods to pass freely through their territories.</p>
<p>In the past six days, the three commissioners and their staff have established a thorough working agreement, and their opinions have become consistent. We hope that this will continue in the future. Undoubtedly, we will have some differences of opinion, but we believe and hope that these differences can be reconciled under the spirit of cooperation maintained by the Execution Department.</p>

<h3>Azerbaijan Province Incident: Health Officially Files Complaint; Pearson Most Highly Touted for "World Prime Minister" Position; UN General Assembly Scheduled to Begin Discussion Next Wednesday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 3:00 AM, 20th: The Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly took formal steps tonight to bring the Azerbaijan dispute before the Security Council. The head of the Iranian delegation sent a document to Jambot, the administrative secretary of the United Nations, stating, "After careful consideration, the Iranian delegation requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 35 of the United Nations Charter, to present the issue of Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs to the Security Council for investigation and appropriate recommendations to resolve this dispute."</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 2:00 AM, 20th: The United Nations Administrative Committee formed a subcommittee this afternoon to conduct preliminary work on the appointment of a Secretary-General of the United Nations. When the Security Council convenes next Wednesday, it will discuss the appointment of a "World Prime Minister," as the importance of the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations is equivalent to that of a "World Prime Minister." There are many possible candidates for this position, but Pearson, the Canadian Ambassador to Washington, is the most highly touted. The Economic and Social Council will also hold its first meeting next Wednesday. At the same time, the Security Council will order the convening of the Military Staff Committee to determine the number of naval, land, and air forces that the fifty-one nations should contribute to the United Nations.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The Iranian delegation discussed all day today how and when to bring the Iranian-Soviet dispute before the United Nations General Assembly, but no decision was reached. An Iranian spokesman declared that no decision would be made tonight and that the meeting would reconvene tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] Iran today cautiously announced its intention to request the assistance of the United Nations Security Council to resolve the issue of Soviet occupation forces in Iran, while Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, vigorously defending the dominance of major powers in the Security Council and other United Nations bodies. This can be described as a coincidence. Iranian officials are clearly hesitant about how to file a complaint with the Security Council and have made it clear that they do not want to cause unnecessary disputes with the Soviet Union. The United Nations is reluctant to openly discuss the matter, with only off-the-record contacts. Delegates behind the scenes see that if this matter reaches a "showdown" stage, it could have serious consequences.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Ends Debate: Will Now Enter Subcommittee Stage; French Representative's Speech Attracts Audience Attention</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 18th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly is proceeding rapidly at the end of this week and will officially enter the subcommittee stage on the 21st. The work of the subcommittees is expected to be completed within two or three weeks. The most important item is the discussion of the joint proposal by six countries to establish an Atomic Energy Commission, which has been submitted to the Political and Security Subcommittee of the General Assembly for preliminary study and review.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The Plenary Assembly of the United Nations convened this morning in Central Hall, London. This was the last day of the general debate of the Assembly. French Foreign Minister Bidault addressed the Assembly this morning, stating, in brief, that the first session of the United Nations General Assembly is attempting to solve not only technical problems related to the future of every nation and mankind, but that responsible politicians feel the importance of their tasks and are willing to do their best to replace the rampant war of many years with lasting peace, and to replace the cruelty and violence with the love of justice. The Charter we have signed contains basic requirements and will inevitably become the Charter of all peoples. Peace and security must be supported by mankind with faith and loyalty. Mankind, having suffered so much terror this time, hopes that the right to survival will be guaranteed. Bidault continued to praise the great idea of the late Roosevelt in creating the United Nations. Finally, he expressed that the French government was very pleased to see the progress of the organization's work.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The leader of the French delegation, Foreign Minister Bidault, is scheduled to speak at the Plenary Assembly today. All parties are now eager to hear France's views on trusteeship, so attention is now focused on Bidault's speech. Regarding the issue of mandated territories, three views have been expressed in the Assembly: (1) Britain, Australia, and New Zealand have all announced their readiness to hand over some of their mandated territories to the Trusteeship Council. (2) The Union of South Africa insists that its mandated territory in Southwest Africa should be incorporated into the Union of South Africa. (3) The Soviet Union wants the mandated territories to be granted autonomy as soon as possible. French sources within the United Nations expect that Bidault will not join the general movement to abandon mandated territories.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Belgian representative Langenhove announced last night at the Plenary Assembly of the United Nations that Belgium intends to hand over its mandated territory of Ruanda-Urundi in central Africa to trusteeship.</p>
<h3>Vishinsky: Mysterious Whereabouts; One Account Placed Him in Turkey</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Even the most famous movie stars cannot be as sought after as Vishinsky, the Soviet Chief Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. Since the opening of the Assembly on January 10th, the halls have resounded with questions of "Will Vishinsky be here today?" Some say he has left Moscow, others say he has arrived in Berlin, others say he has returned to Moscow, and some even say he has been seen in Croydon. Even the official TASS news agency does not know where its chief representative is staying. A certain representative from a South American country, known for his astuteness, today learned from an authoritative source that Vishinsky has left Moscow by plane. When a reporter asked when he would come to London, the representative replied, "He is not coming here; he has flown back to Moscow."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] According to Angola Broadcasting: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky recently met with Turkish Foreign Minister Saka under extremely secretive circumstances. Saka proposed ceding the provinces of Kars and Ardahan to the Soviet Union, but only if the Soviet Union abandoned its demand that the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles become part of the Georgian province. Saka also claimed that Britain and the United States might agree to the Soviet Union's demands for the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, but would definitely not agree to the demands for the Dardanelles.</p>
<h3>Indian Representative Calls for Racial and Social Equality</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The head of the Indian delegation, Mudaliar, spoke yesterday at the United Nations General Assembly, vigorously calling for social equality for all classes and races. He said: "There must be social equality before the root of war can be removed. If so, the Security Council can adjourn and leave the work to the Economic and Social Council. As for the atomic bomb, he hopes that the planned control measures will become a reality and not just an illusion. Looking around the hall, he felt that the atmosphere was harmonious, and it was difficult to believe that the atomic bomb existed. Although this bomb has indeed been invented and seems to have caused great changes, it will ultimately not be able to destroy the doctrines of various religions. We have now reached a stage where we do not want empty talk, but only seek reality, and that is why we have established this United Nations organization. We are deeply gratified that the major powers have respected the dignity of the Charter and have successively reiterated their desire to maintain peace." When Mr. Mudaliar took the stage to speak, the delegates responded with warm applause.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th] The Soviet representative spoke yesterday at the United Nations General Assembly, opposing the reduction of the power of the major powers in the Security Council. Today, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser criticized the veto power of the major powers in the Security Council. New Zealand's opinion on the Atomic Energy Commission is also different from that of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, believing that the committee should report to the fifty-one-nation Assembly and not just to the eleven-nation Council.</p>
<p>Yugoslav Prime Minister Gater, the first person to speak yesterday, stated that in this new organization, the major powers must be given rights and responsibilities, and the Charter should not be amended to restrict them. Yugoslavia also intends to draw the attention of the United Nations General Assembly to the fact that its ethnic boundaries have been forced eastward by fascist troops, and this matter must be resolved. Mr. Gater's remarks almost certainly refer to the border dispute between Yugoslavia and Italy.</p>
<h3>Forrestal to Be Succeeded by Bowles as Undersecretary of the Navy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Undersecretary of the Navy Forrestal resigned, and President Truman today appointed Bowles as his successor. Mr. Bowles recently served as a commissioner for Japanese reparations and has not been back in the country long. Undersecretary of the Army Lovett has also resigned, and his vacancy will be filled by Symington, the current director of the Surplus Property Administration. Both appointments have been submitted to the Senate for approval.</p>
<h3>British, American, Soviet, and French Foreign Minister Representatives Discuss Treaties with Five Countries; British Foreign Secretary and Italian Deputy Prime Minister Hold Extensive Talks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] American Foreign Minister Representative James Dunn, British Foreign Minister Representative Campbell, Soviet Foreign Minister Representative Gusev, and French Foreign Minister Representative Mouvelle held their first meeting this evening to discuss treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, based on the agreement reached at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers. At the same time, American Secretary of State Byrnes announced that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union had sent a reply to France stating that the opinions of other relevant countries on the treaties would be fully considered. However, France can only participate in the discussion of the treaty with Italy, not the others. According to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Agreement, the treaties drafted by the representatives of the relevant countries, with the consent of the foreign ministers of each country, will be convened at a peace conference in Paris on May 5 by representatives of the twenty-one warring countries. At that time, representatives of all countries can express their opinions. However, the final decision-making power on the terms of the treaty rests solely with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union for the treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. For the Italian treaty, it rests with the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. For Finland, it rests solely with Britain and the Soviet Union, because the United States did not declare war on Finland.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met today with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Nenni and discussed many issues. According to a spokesman for the Italian embassy, they exchanged views on the status of the Italian Socialist Party, future elections in Italy, and the Italian peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Contents of Reply to France Published</h3>
<p>[American News, Washington, 18th] The State Department today released a note from Secretary of State Byrnes to the French government, dated January 13th, which was published simultaneously in London, Paris, and Washington. "I am pleased to learn that the French government has expressed its willingness to participate in the conference to consider peace treaties, and I hereby invite the relevant governments to send representatives to Paris to attend the conference. Therefore, I hereby issue the following statement on behalf of the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Report: (1) The French government will be informed of the future work of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. As far as we know, the future task of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. However, after the peace conference is held, the signatory countries to the armistice treaty will draft the final treaty with reference to the recommendations of the peace conference. As stated in the French government's letter, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates the preparation of a peaceful solution for Germany, and the Moscow Agreement has no intention of changing this point. In addition, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the member governments can assign tasks to the Foreign Ministers' Conference at any time, and the Moscow Conference did not change this provision. (2) Regarding the second point of the French government's letter, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the Foreign Ministers' Conference may invite representatives of these governments to attend whenever issues related to other governments are discussed. Since the Moscow Agreement had no intention of revoking the Potsdam Agreement, the Foreign Ministers' Conference still retains the right to invite representatives of relevant countries to attend the discussions. (3) In future meetings, extensive and thorough discussions will be held, and final conditions will be drafted only after full consideration of the recommendations of the conference. The French government can rest assured on this point. We firmly believe that the conclusion of the final treaty will not arbitrarily reject the recommendations put forward by the conference. (4) Regarding the opinions of the countries on the other side of the conditions, the preparatory work for drafting the treaty will take into account the opinions of these countries and provide them with ample opportunity to discuss the treaty and put forward their opinions. I believe that the above explanation has fully explained the work of the conference, and I hope that the French government will confirm its agreement to participate in this conference."</p>
<h3>US Loan to China: $33 Million for Cotton Purchases Approved by US Export-Import Bank</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C., US News Service, 18th] Taylor, Chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, announced yesterday that the bank's board of directors has approved a $33 million credit loan to finance the export of cotton to China. This loan is sufficient to ship 275,000 to 300,000 bales of cotton. The loan terms are largely similar to the US cotton loans the bank made to European countries last October, with one exception. Given the differing time required for ocean and inland transport in China, the new loan to China will require repayment within 24 months after the cotton arrives, rather than the 35 months stipulated for European countries. It is believed that China primarily needs cotton with shorter fibers. This loan, similar in nature to other construction loans previously approved by the bank, aims to assist reconstruction and accelerate the return to peacetime conditions. China does not lack weaving equipment or labor. Today, the demand for cotton textiles is high worldwide, primarily due to production losses in the UK, China, and Japan. Countries lacking cotton fabric manufacturing rely heavily on these regions. China's current raw cotton supply is insufficient for large-scale weaving. This new supply of raw cotton may be sufficient to meet demand. According to recent statistics, Shanghai alone has 2.3 million spindles, and North China has 1 million, available for cotton yarn production. It is reported that on January 1st of this year, Shanghai had fewer than 1 million spindles in operation due to a lack of cotton. With the assistance of this cotton loan, sufficient raw cotton will be available this year to operate approximately 600,000 spindles, potentially increasing cotton fabric production by 500 million yards. This is about one-seventh of China's pre-war annual total production from hand-weaving and machine-weaving. The revitalization of China's cotton textile industry will reduce the burden on the United States in shipping cotton textiles to China for relief through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The reconstruction of weaving can also reduce other relief needs. Increased employment opportunities in China will contribute to China's domestic economic development. The loan terms stipulate that cotton exports will proceed through US private commercial channels, and all qualified cotton exporters may utilize this loan. Within the limits of this loan, all loans will be guaranteed by approved Chinese banks and the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>US Petroleum Experts Depart for China to Assist in Developing the Oil Refining Industry</h3>
<p>[New York, United Press, 18th] The National Resources Committee announced today that four petroleum experts will leave the US for China on the 20th of this month to assist China in building and developing its oil refining industry. The four experts are Iglesias and Chan Lai, representatives of Universal Oil Products Company, and Ruebel and Small, representatives of United Engineering Company. The former two will be responsible for drafting plans for the construction and development of oil refineries, while the latter two will examine the current state of existing refineries, plan the repair of damaged refineries, and expand the kerosene industry to meet China's current and future needs. According to United Engineering Company, its engineers will conduct on-site inspections of areas where oil has already been extracted, paying particular attention to areas close to densely populated cities.</p>
<h3>Chinese Air Force Officers Studying in the US to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C., US News Service, 16th] Twenty-five Chinese Air Force officers, who have been studying aircraft engine design in the United States for a year, have graduated and are preparing to return to China today.</p>
<p>[New York, Central News Agency, 18th] It is reported that twenty-three Chinese naval shipbuilding representatives, who have been studying in the United States for over a year, will return to work at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai and other factories.</p>
<h3>US President Acknowledges Mediation Failure, Steel Industry to Stage Major Strike, 800,000 Members to Strike on Monday Morning</h3>
<p>[Chicago, United Press, 19th] Government efforts to resolve two major labor disputes in the United States have failed today. Eight hundred thousand steelworkers have re-issued orders to strike starting Monday due to US Steel's rejection of President Truman's wage increase proposal. President Truman issued a statement from the White House, saying that this was a matter of great regret for him and the nation. All efforts to avoid a steel industry strike have so far failed.</p>
<p>[Pittsburgh, USA, United Press, 19th] The labor dispute in the US steel industry has been prolonged and unresolved, and an unprecedented strike is about to erupt. According to the planned schedule, at one minute past midnight tomorrow, "750,000 steelworkers will strike." Workers at the largest US steel mills have already begun picketing today. According to the union's "strike list," 1,292 steel mills in thirty states are on strike.</p>
<p>[New York, Reuters, 19th] According to a White House official spokesman, President Truman has no plans to intervene to avoid a strike at the last minute. Unless there is an unexpected and surprising action, this most important basic industry in the United States will shut down on Monday, and other industries in the US production economy will be affected within a few weeks. President Truman still hopes for a solution, but both sides are now preparing for a battle and there is no sign of reconciliation. Earlier, the union had accepted President Truman's proposal to avoid a labor dispute, but US Steel President Fairless did not agree, and negotiations, which had lasted a week under President Truman's leadership, broke down. Meanwhile, the president of the New York Transport Workers Union said that workers on subway and surface public vehicles would strike within two weeks, at which time all transport services in the city would be shut down. The labor dispute involving meatpacking workers remains deadlocked.</p>
<h3>A "Holiday of Death": Coffin Makers in New York City Strike Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[New York, Central News Agency, 18th] Strikes are sweeping the United States, and now a new inconvenience has arisen. The strike of coffin makers, what is commonly called a "holiday of death," is most fitting at this time. This strike is currently limited to the areas surrounding New York City. The New York City government has stated that if this strike continues to be prolonged, the resulting health and religious problems will be of great concern.</p>

<h3>International Military Tribunal Established in Tokyo to Try Far East War Criminals, Maximum of Nine Judges to be Appointed by MacArthur, Kagesa Teikun and Tani Hisao are Both Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 19th] MacArthur today ordered the establishment of an International Military Tribunal to try Far East war crime suspects, and at the same time promulgated detailed trial regulations. The tribunal will be located in Tokyo, and the number of judges will be at least five and at most nine, nominated by the countries that signed the Japanese surrender document, and then appointed by the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. After the tribunal is established, it will quickly and fairly try the major war criminals in the Far East and impose the punishment they deserve. Individuals or members of any group accused of crimes against peace will be tried, as will others who have committed inhumane crimes. The Chief Justice and Prosecutor of the tribunal will be appointed by MacArthur, but the United Nations who fought against Japan may appoint Assistant Judges. The tribunal shall ensure that the trial period is not unnecessarily delayed, and will not accept appeals unrelated to the trial. The tribunal may also determine whether the defendant is physically or mentally fit to stand trial.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, Central News Agency, 18th Dispatch] Allied Headquarters today ordered the arrest of 111 Japanese officers and Japanese suspects, including five generals, whose names are familiar to the Chinese people. The five are Kagesa Teikun, Tani Hisao, Isogai Rensuke, Wachi Takaji, and Kawaguchi, all of whom bear major responsibility for the war against China. Among the five arrested, the most well-known to our people is Lieutenant General Kagesa, who was the brains behind the puppet Nanjing government and a close friend of Wang Jingwei. He served under Isogai Rensuke and implemented attacks in China. Another who caused our people to gnash their teeth in hatred was Tani Hisao, the former commander of the Japanese 6th Division. When he entered Nanjing, he created the shameful "Nanjing Massacre" in the history of the Sino-Japanese War. Isogai Rensuke was the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and he and Wachi Takaji were the right-hand men of Doihara Kenji before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Kawaguchi was the Japanese military spokesman in Beiping after the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>[Beiping, United Press, 19th] Former German Ambassador to Japan, Eugen Ott, is being escorted to Tokyo today and will be questioned about various matters related to the Tojo Cabinet, as former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo will soon be tried as a war crime suspect. He had been living in Beiping for the past three years and was arrested by US military police on Thursday and flown to Japan yesterday. Ott served as the German Ambassador to Japan from April 1938 to January 1942. During that period, he played a significant role in strengthening the Axis relationship between Germany and Japan. He participated in the negotiations of the Anti-Comintern Pact and was one of the signatories of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Japan, and Italy.</p>
<h3>Korean Students Demonstrate Against Trusteeship, Police Kill Two, 119 Arrested</h3>
<p>[Seoul, United Press, 19th] Over two hundred members of the Right-wing Korean Student Alliance held a demonstration last night to oppose trusteeship. Carrying posters, the students marched past the Soviet Consulate and the US Occupation Forces Headquarters. This morning, police intervened and clashed with the students. Police fired over a hundred shots, resulting in two deaths and several injuries, and 119 arrests. The left-wing People's Party newspaper "People's Daily" was attacked by demonstrators and suffered heavy damage. Afterwards, US military commander General Hodge gave a broadcast speech, demanding an end to the demonstrations. US observers believe that opposition to trusteeship is merely an excuse, and the real issue is the struggle between the extreme left and the right.</p>
<h3>Japanese Shidehara Cabinet Controlled by Mitsuchi, Suzuki and Fujita to be Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, Central News Agency, 18th Dispatch] The most well-informed sources in the Japanese Cabinet believe that the reorganized Shidehara government is the Mitsuchi Cabinet because the newly appointed Interior Minister Mitsuchi Chuzo is actually controlling the Shidehara government. It is pointed out that Mitsuchi has placed his confidants in the cabinet and has influenced Shidehara's selection of personnel. Mitsuchi originally intended to be the prime minister of the new cabinet, but Shidehara ultimately decided to reorganize instead of resigning completely, which was in fact a concession to Interior Minister Mitsuchi.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 19th] Today's "Minpo" predicts that Emperor Hirohito's closest confidants, Suzuki Kantaro and Fujita Hisanori, will also be forced to resign in the short term due to MacArthur's instructions. Suzuki was the prime minister at the time of Japan's surrender and is now the President of the Privy Council. Fujita is the Minister of the Imperial Household. The newspaper said that they will resign as soon as Prime Minister Shidehara resumes work. It also said: "After a detailed study of the Allied Supreme Commander's instructions, it is known that not only the President of the Privy Council but also other members of the Council should be held responsible for the war and removed from office. If the government does not abolish the Privy Council and reorganize the Imperial Household Ministry, it will be suspected of intending to deceive the instructions."</p>
<p>Issuing Emergency Order to Force Grain Collection</p>
<p>[Tokyo, United Press, 19th] The Japanese cabinet decided today to issue an emergency order to restore full control of staple foods in order to cope with the serious food shortage in the country. The cabinet's decision was made because the amount of rice sold by farmers to the government by January 10th was only 28 percent of the stipulated total. This order empowers government authorities to forcibly purchase rice from farmers who have not supplied the stipulated amount, and those who violate the order will be severely punished. The penalties include imprisonment for up to three years or a fine of up to 10,000 yen. This order also gives the government the power to strictly control food transactions in the market and to restore price controls on perishable foods. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to determine the supply of farm tools to farmers based on the amount of rice they deliver.</p>

<h3>Climbing Mountains and Crossing Valleys: Running Single and Risking Lives for Money</h3>
<p>[Bern, Reuters, 19th] Italian smugglers, in groups and armed, stream across the snowy peaks of the Swiss-Italian border into Switzerland. Swiss border guards conduct dangerous patrols in the mountains, leading to small-scale clashes and increasing casualties on both sides. According to Swiss authorities, the mountains are bitterly cold, and there are frequent deaths from avalanches. However, Italian smugglers, driven by profit, still flock to the area. They smuggle goods such as rice and sugar, which are strictly controlled in Switzerland, and return with coffee and tobacco, which are plentiful in Swiss stocks. These goods are sold at very high prices on the black market in Italy. The authorities, concerned about the rampant smuggling, have transferred special border guards from the north to the southern border to deal with the situation, and there is a proposal to deploy regular troops to reinforce them. However, the Swiss people in the border area, who are making a good profit, oppose the authorities' measures. Those who are unwilling to cooperate are even assassinated. The Swiss customs authorities have issued a serious warning to the people that those who participate in smuggling activities will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Jewish Smugglers Intercepted by British Ships</h3>
<p>[Haifa, United Press, 18th] According to reliable sources, 900 Jews, including 368 women, arrived on a 500-ton steamship in an attempt to evade the Palestinian immigration authorities and enter the country illegally. However, they were intercepted by British planes and warships and were unable to achieve their goal. The ship, flying the blue and white flag of Jewish nationalism from its mast, was spotted by a British plane yesterday 40 miles off the coast of Palestine. A destroyer then arrived to intercept the ship and sent a team to board it, ordering it to sail to Palestine. No accidents occurred during the landing of the Jews. They were guarded by a large number of troops from the British 6th Airborne Division and transported by bus to the Athlit detention camp south of Haifa. According to a statement issued from Jerusalem, the ship's owner and crew have been detained, and the ship is also being guarded by troops. The ship's owner has been identified as a Romanian, but the nationality of the flag it was flying is unknown. The ship was carrying a large number of smuggled Jews and is said to have sailed from a port in southern Italy twelve days ago. Five people on board were ill and sent to hospital, but the rest were in good health. The ship's name, "Sereni," was taken from an Italian Jewish labor leader who was brutally murdered after German paratroopers landed in northern Italy. Several passengers on board were recent escapees from concentration camps, and the rest of the Jews were refugees from all over Europe.</p>

<p>Petition for Thorough Investigation into the Release of Captured Bandits</p>
<p>On the previous day, eight plainclothes bandits, carrying guns and live ammunition, suddenly arrived at the county, village, township town and robbed shops and residents of their property, and chased the masses in the city, looting rice and demanding money. For a time, the people were panicked and closed their doors. The villagers reported to the Township Winter Defense Team and Special Task Force, who captured seven people on the spot and escorted them to the township office. Several of them were police officers during the enemy puppet regime. Zhu township chief then sent someone to escort the captured bandits to the county for legal action. However, due to the late hour upon arrival in Pinghu, the bandits were temporarily lodged in the Special Task Force of the East Gate. Unexpectedly, they were overheard by a patrol team from the County Police Bureau that night, who went to rob them and released them completely, and instead detained Zhu township chief and four plaintiffs. More than two hundred villagers from the village have automatically gone to the county government, the Provisional Council, and the county party headquarters to petition, and severely punish the releasing officer.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>Using Counterfeit Money, Arrested on the Spot</p>

On the evening of January 12, he went to Taifeng, Baocheng and other silver shops and bought gold rings one after another. On the morning of the 13th, he went to Ruiyuanfu Silver Shop to trade jewelry. Because the small denomination thousand-yuan legal tender of the Central Bank he used (issued in the 34th year of the Republic of China) had a blurred portrait of Sun Yat-sen and looked suspicious, he sent the original currency used by Xu for identification by the local bank. It was found to be counterfeit, and the police were immediately alerted, and Xu was arrested along with the counterfeit ticket and taken to the bureau for interrogation according to law.</p>

When they arrived at Lubu Town, they encountered the bandits, and both sides opened fire on each other. Township Magistrate Cai was unfortunately shot and killed by the bandits. The county government considers that the township chief bravely fought against bandits and died in the line of duty, and will hold a memorial service in the coming days.</p>
<p>Wenling</p>
<p>Showing Compassion for the People's Difficulties, Reduce the Purchase of Military Grain</p>
<p>The Wenling County Council of the Province of Taiwan, considering that this county was ordered to raise 51,030 piculs of military grain, with a price of 2,200 yuan per picul, and that the county's total farmland is 476,684 mu of level land and 16,730 mu of mountain land, with about 148,024 mu of barren sandy land in these two categories, and an average yield of about 2 piculs per mu for medium harvests, the total harvest of the county is 986,828 piculs, and the population of more than 500,000 is already feeling insufficient. In recent years, it has suffered from disasters and famines. If the purchase is made according to this amount, the rich will have no means of living, and the poor will have difficulty finding food. The current market price of rice is about 8,000 yuan per picul, a huge difference. It should be purchased with reduced amounts and adjusted prices in consideration of the people's difficulties to relieve the people's distress.</p>
<p>Wuhu</p>
<p>Patrolling Police Shot by Soldiers</p>

On the evening of the 15th, it was discovered that a large number of soldiers were hiding in the Jiatai Foreign Company at No. 26 Siming Road, setting up several beds and openly smoking opium. Four sets of smoking paraphernalia were collected and taken back. Unexpectedly, after leaving the door, the soldiers in the room each took out their short guns and fired, and three people, including police chief Fang Kun and police officer Zhang Dechuan, died on the spot, and two police officers, including Zhang Guocai, were seriously injured. After receiving the report, the police bureau dispatched a large team with weapons to rush to the scene and surrounded the house. The soldiers in the room continued to fire their guns to resist, and the whole city was shocked. Then, the platoon leader of the military police team led a large team of armed military police to arrive and arrested twelve soldiers who caused the disaster and handed them over to the military police team for interrogation. The residents of the accident were the Sixth Communications Group of a certain army. In addition to reporting the facts to the Army Headquarters and the provincial government, the police bureau will raise funds to treat, comfort, and mourn the police officers who died and were injured.</p>

<h3>American General and Diplomat – Eisenhower – Current Situation in Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>The massive Pentagon building in Washington is still the nerve center of the world's strongest army, always operating at a wartime pace. Inside the orderly building, the air carries a sense of tension. Orders are executed quickly and accurately here, and files filled with numbers move from one desk to another, from one office to another, fully demonstrating the fervor of wartime work. At the moment, taking the lead in everything is the powerful personality of the new Chief of Staff, Eisenhower. He makes it clear that there are still many difficult problems to be solved, all of which require a combined application of talents as a soldier and a diplomat.</p>
<p>President Truman Believes that Eisenhower is "Our First-Class Diplomat"</p>
<p>General Eisenhower, who recently succeeded General Marshall to the highest position in the entire international army, deserves to be remembered for his great achievements. In the victory in Europe, he played a decisive role in strategy and tactics, which is an undeniable fact. If further proof is needed, then the former staff of the German General Staff made it clear at the Nuremberg Tribunal that the biggest factor that brought the proud and powerful Third Reich to its knees was none other than Eisenhower's superhuman talent as a general.</p>
<p>President Truman once told a visitor that in his mind, Eisenhower "is exactly the first-class diplomat we can have." The president's selection of him as Marshall's successor must be closely related to this important understanding, because in the coming months and years, how to deal with the people, and how to eliminate the contradictions and disorders in American military policy, is really the main task of the Chief of Staff, and the U.S. Army will obviously shoulder an unprecedented important task in the future world situation, and its nature, the diplomatic component is naturally far more than the preparedness component.</p>
<p>General Eisenhower, who is burdened with the important task of Chief of Staff, fulfills two broad tasks: First, in addition to the "commanding the army" which is his natural job, he must provide advice to the Secretary of the Army, the President, and Congress on all policies related to the military. Second, he must be responsible for the implementation of policies established or practiced by the Army in the future. He insists that within the scope of his advisory authority, he has the right to argue and disagree, but for policies that have been established and implemented by him, he believes that his responsibility is to implement them conscientiously, without dissent.</p>
<p>All important actions and decisions of the Army are carried out in the name of the Chief of Staff, so the responsibility for final consideration of each important decision rests on him. Naturally, the scope of this matter is very broad, and it is impossible for him to measure and decide on so many complex issues (and many highly technical ones), so a set of daily work is very important.</p>
<p>Eisenhower's Determination: "If I Don't Firmly Believe that America Can Make the Greatest Contribution to the World, I'll Only Do It for Five Minutes."</p>
<p>In the first few weeks of his tenure, many things were sorted out by his staff and simplified. They all praised Eisenhower's wisdom and decisiveness in dealing with complex problems.</p>
<p>But the biggest of the problems he deals with every day is demobilization. He has instructed his staff to study to understand what is the most dangerous link in the problem. He is concerned about the extent to which the dissolution of American troops reveals military weaknesses? To what extent will the United States lose prestige and influence on order and stability in other parts of the world? This stable order was originally exchanged for great sacrifices in the war.</p>
<p>Eisenhower must use all his talents and diplomatic skills to prevent demobilization from going too far and to reduce the serious pressure from Congress to "bring my children home." The people of the Army Department now think that he will definitely act proactively, even at the cost of sacrificing his very high prestige. This can be proved by a conversation he had with one of his staff after taking office:</p>
<p>"We fought this war not to maintain the status quo, but to change some terrible scenes for the better. If I don't firmly believe that a strong America will make the greatest contribution to world peace, then I will only do the current job for five minutes at most." (American Translation)</p>
<p>General Marshall, along with Mrs. Eisenhower, went to a certain airport in Washington to welcome Eisenhower's enthusiastic return to the motherland. Marshal [standing on the right] went to welcome him in the capacity of a military and political representative.</p>
<p>[Top Picture] On the day Eisenhower returned to Washington, D.C., President Truman held a medal-awarding ceremony for him in the White House and pinned a "Distinguished Service Medal" on his lapel. Beside him is Mrs. Eisenhower. The enthusiasm of the people welcoming Eisenhower's return home was unprecedented in American history.</p>
<p>[Bottom Picture] The day after Eisenhower flew back to his motherland from Paris, he made a trip to New York. When he drove through the bustling city center, the citizens were all out, scrambling to catch a glimpse of the general. The general was moved by the enthusiasm of the crowd and responded with smiles, nods, handshakes, and even innocent childish jumps, which were unconsciously revealed.</p>
<p>The picture shows a school child rushing forward and offering flowers to pay tribute to Eisenhower when he visited his alma mater, the United States Military Academy, which made him feel particularly sincere and kind.</p>
<h3>Member Chen Lifu Expresses Views on the National Congress Issues</h3>
<p>In the eighth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Chen Lifu expressed the following opinions on the issue of the National Congress:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the National Congress, I have heard many insightful opinions from you all, which I greatly admire! I personally feel that when we discuss this issue, we must first recognize several basic concepts: First, during the transition from a one-party political system to a multi-party political system, the existing one-party political system cannot be obliterated. Some people criticize the one-party rule political system as an object of criticism for the transition to a multi-party political system, so everything is considered wrong, and in the end, all problems cannot be solved.</p>
<p>From One-Party to Multi-Party</p>
<p>The Past Cannot Be Denied</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Kuomintang in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the methods of nation-building led by its government have actually told us that it has indeed taken the Soviet system as a model. If we must criticize this from the standpoint of a multi-party system, of course, everything is wrong, and it is not easy to solve all problems, because these two systems are fundamentally different. Today, we want to move from a one-party system to a multi-party system. If we absolutely deny the facts of the past one-party system, there is no need for consultation. From the standpoint of a multi-party system, everything about nation-building is a right, and from the standpoint of one-party dictatorship, everything about nation-building is an obligation. In short, in the middle of this stage from one-party to multi-party, we must recognize the facts of both sides in order to reach a fair and reasonable conclusion. There is also a reason why such an election law was produced.</p>
<p>Regardless of What Party They Are</p>
<p>Only Ask If They Can Represent the People</p>
<p>The Kuomintang used revolutionary methods to overthrow the Manchus, defeat the warlords, and convene the National Assembly. The law formulated by the National Assembly stipulated in the Provisional Constitution that before the implementation of constitutionalism, the National Congress of the Kuomintang would exercise the functions of the National Assembly on behalf of the National Assembly. According to this regulation, the National Congress was convened, and the Kuomintang's task was completed only after the Constitution was formulated, promulgated and implemented, so the organizational members of the National Congress included members of the Kuomintang Central Committee, which was in line with the intention of returning power to the people. In our view, this is not a privilege, on the contrary, it is a special obligation. This method was produced from historical evolution, and it is also at the time of returning power, saying that there should be no party members among the representatives. May I ask why he would not hesitate to sacrifice blood and fight for it? It is too strange. National Congress representatives cannot ask what party they are or are not, as long as they represent the people. If a party does not recognize him, then he has to run around between the parties before he can be a representative, which is difficult to be a representative.</p>
<p>Remedial Measures Conform to National Conditions</p>
<p>Must Not Be Regarded As Violating Democracy</p>
<p>Second, remedial measures are suitable for China's national conditions and are not undemocratic. Some people think that assuming representatives are undemocratic. You should know that China's current national conditions are different from those of European and American civilized countries. This can also be seen from the elections. Many people who are qualified to be elected and should be elected often do not compete. If there are no remedial measures, those who are young and active will inevitably be elected, and those who are well-qualified but unwilling to compete cannot participate, which is also a major shortcoming. The production of members of the National Political Council has several items of A, B, C, and D, one of which is produced by designated methods, precisely to remedy the defects just mentioned, because there are many people in China who are willing to come out only after three visits, although from a democratic point of view, it can be said that it is undemocratic, but from a factual point of view, it is quite necessary. The National Congress representatives can be reasonably increased. Third, the explanation of the term of office must be clear. Now, people generally say that the representatives were elected ten years ago, and the term of office of the National Congress representatives is six years, thinking that his term of office has expired. It is not known that the term of office should be calculated from the date of taking office. Since the National Congress has not been convened today, they have not taken office. How can the term of office have expired? There is no regulation saying that from the date of election is his term of office. The term of office of the National Congress representatives should start from the date of the passage of the Constitution. Today, because our interpretation of the term of office is blurred, the issue of whether the representatives are valid or invalid has arisen. To discuss people's livelihood, we must not disregard the law. This democracy is lawless. The focus of democracy is on the majority. More than 900 National Congress representatives are produced from elections in various regions. They include more than 350 million people. They themselves have not denied him. Who has the right to revoke his qualifications? Today, it is definitely not an issue of whether the elected representatives are valid or invalid, but how to reasonably increase the National Congress representatives so that they can better represent all the people and achieve a more thorough purpose for the constitutional work. This is why we want political consultation, and we rely on political methods to solve it.</p>
<h3>The Eighth Meeting of the Negotiation Conference: Heated Debate Among All Parties</h3>
<p>The Political Negotiation Conference held its eighth meeting on the 18th at 9:00 AM. The original agenda included: (1) continued discussion of the National Assembly issue, and (2) the draft constitution issue. However, due to the lengthy discussion of the National Assembly issue, the draft constitution was postponed for discussion tomorrow. Thirty-four members, including Li Zhuchen, attended today's meeting. After Secretary-General Lei reported the attendance, Chairman Sun Ke announced the opening of the meeting.</p>
<p>**Luo Longji**</p>
<p>First spoke, opposing the validity of the old National Assembly representatives. He claimed that the government's credibility and current practical political difficulties should be taken into account, but the credibility of the new constitution and the theory of the constitution should also be considered. Luo criticized the arguments of Wang Yunwu, Hu Lin, Fu Sinian, and Zhang Wansheng yesterday, but agreed with the opinions of Guo Moruo and Deng Yingchao. He further proposed the following points on behalf of the Democratic League: (1) If the old representatives are maintained, a public opinion poll must be conducted, held by intellectuals such as industrial, commercial, cultural, and student figures. (2) Hold a runoff election with the old representatives as candidates. (3) Do not convene the National Assembly; instead, experts should draft the constitution, and citizens should vote on it.</p>
<p>**Zhou Enlai**</p>
<p>Then explained the meaning of negotiation, harmony, and politics, resolving three points. He said that because there are different opinions, negotiation is necessary. Although there is debate, each other's opinions should be valued, listened to, and accepted to seek common principles. Zhou also said that recognizing or not recognizing the old representatives is one thing, and the CCP's participation in the National Assembly is another. He opposed recognizing the old representatives.</p>
<p>**Chen Lifu**</p>
<p>Spoke for the first time today, stating that in discussing the National Assembly issue, several basic concepts must first be clarified: First, during the transition from a one-party political system to a multi-party political system, the existing one-party political system cannot be erased. Otherwise, all problems cannot be solved. From the standpoint of multiple parties, all nation-building work is seen as a right, but from the standpoint of one-party dictatorship, it is seen as an obligation. Second, Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Election Law, which stipulates that the government designates 240 representatives, is a remedial measure. Although not absolutely good, it is suitable for China's national conditions because China is different from Europe and the United States. Those who have the qualifications to be elected and should be elected often consider themselves too noble to run for election, so this method must be used to remedy the situation. Third, the original text does not clearly stipulate the term of office of representatives, so there is controversy. Some people say that the representatives elected ten years ago have already reached the end of their six-year term according to the draft constitution, but they do not know that the term of office should be calculated from the date of assumption of office. Now that the National Assembly has not yet been convened and the representatives have not yet taken office, the term of office is not only not over but has not even started. Moreover, the non-assumption of office by the old representatives during the eight years of the war of resistance is a special circumstance. As for the draft constitution not yet being passed according to law, it cannot be used to limit the term of office of representatives. Chen finally said that to purchase democracy, the law must be taken into account, otherwise, it will be lawless. How can it be called democracy? The representatives elected by the past National Assembly were all produced by various regions of the country. If democracy must be decided by the majority, then no one has the right to cancel their qualifications.</p>
<p>**Wu Tiecheng**</p>
<p>Made supplementary comments on the point of maintaining the old representatives. He said that the reasons for opposing the old representatives are no more than two points: (1) The representatives elected in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) are not sufficient to represent today's public opinion; (2) Many people who did not have the right to vote or be elected in that year have now obtained it and should not be deprived of their rights. Regarding the first point, the representatives elected in the local areas have mostly participated in the war of resistance and service in the past eight years. Their experience and understanding have been improved, and they are more sufficient to represent public opinion. Regarding the second point, those who have obtained the right to vote or be elected today cannot exceed the number of people who had the right to vote or be elected in that year. The rights of a few people should not be taken into account, while the election results of those who have already obtained the right to vote are not recognized. Wu finally said that the National Assembly issue is not purely a theoretical issue but a practical issue.</p>
<p>**Wang Yunwu**</p>
<p>Responded to Luo Longji's opinion. He believes that the foundation of democracy is in the rule of law. If the law is erased, then this kind of democracy is unreliable. The spirit of the rule of law is that the people should abide by the law, and the government should also abide by the law. The government cannot arbitrarily change the law, otherwise, it will conflict with the democratic stance. He believes that the National Assembly Organization Law has a shortcoming, that is, the representatives do not have a fixed term of office, and there is no way to cancel the qualifications of representatives. He agrees to modify it. But the representatives elected in the past must be maintained. He further emphasized that the law and facts should be taken into account, and he hopes that the 460 seats reserved for the KMT's Central Committee members should be given up to accommodate representatives from various parties. Wang also said that Luo believes that these representatives are produced through negotiation and cannot gain the respect of the people, then the constitution drafted in the future will not be able to gain the respect of the people either. He expressed doubt. As for the public opinion poll method, if only intellectuals participate, it is questionable whether it can represent the opinions of the entire population.</p>
<p>**Shao Congen**</p>
<p>Said that he had spent a night thinking hard about this issue and had come up with another method, that is, to solve this problem with three meetings from now on: (1) The first meeting is the current Political Negotiation Conference, and its task is for the various parties to mutually formulate the steps to start democracy, draft and amend the National Assembly Organization Law and Election Law, and even the outline of the draft constitution, and submit a proposal. (2) The second meeting will still be convened on May 5th as proposed by the government, and the Organization Law, Election Law, and draft constitution that we have amended will be submitted to that meeting for discussion and decision as the formal Organization Law, Election Law, and draft constitution. This meeting is equivalent to the preparatory meeting for the National Assembly advocated by Sun Yat-sen. The nine categories of farmers, workers, and businessmen mentioned by Sun Yat-sen are also included, so whether the old representatives are overthrown or not will not become a major issue. (3) The third meeting is the meeting established according to the Organization Law and Election Law decided by the second meeting, and its task is to draft and implement the constitution. Shao believes that this method does not violate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and all aspects of reality and the future of the constitution can be taken into account. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<p>**Reader's Opinion**</p>
<h3>Democracy and Military Rule</h3>
<p>The Kuomintang speaks of democracy, the Communist Party speaks of democracy, and people from all parties and factions also speak of democracy. Domestic public opinion is like this, and overseas forums are also like this. In short, to this day, no one says they don't want democracy or oppose democracy. But why can't China be democratic? It seems that everyone still lacks an understanding of the core of the problem, so I should say a few words: First, I want to ask, what is democracy? The explanation is very simple: it is sovereignty residing in the people. All people have the right to participate in politics. The Principle of People's Rights in the Three Principles of the People has already stated this clearly. Since China is not a monarchical autocracy but a democratic republic, all people should naturally obtain political liberation. Then, the second question is, how do people participate in politics? The general method is for the people to elect representatives, organize parliament, and establish a government. However, the system in the United States and Britain differs from that of the Soviet Union, and the organization in the United States and Britain differs from that of various countries on the continent. Which one should we adopt?</p>
<p>Because British and American politics are organized by large parties, the party that wins the parliamentary election forms the government. For example, when the Labour Party recently won in the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party handed over power, and the Labour Party formed the cabinet. In continental France, because small parties are separated, it is difficult for any one party to obtain an absolute majority in parliament. Therefore, they have no choice but to form a coalition government with several parties. And because the opinions of each faction often differ, the organization of the coalition government is extremely unstable and often needs to be reorganized and re-elected. It is not the same in the United States and Britain. Once a party has power, it can often maintain it until the second election. In the middle of the specified term, unless there is a split within the party or a major change, it rarely fails to continue. This is the democratic method of parliamentary political countries in Europe and the United States. Because the Soviet Union is a proletarian dictatorship, its so-called Soviets only have representatives of the Communist Party. Although there are also representatives of non-Communist parties, they do not have another party organization, which is equivalent to nothing. They cannot rise up and organize a government, so political power is always in the hands of the Communist Party. This is the "democratic political" method of a one-party dictatorship in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>As far as China is concerned, the Kuomintang has not advocated a one-party dictatorship (the current political system is a transitional period of tutelage), and what the Communist Party requires is only to organize a coalition government. According to this, China's democratic politics should be a parliamentary system where various parties in Europe and the United States stand side by side, not the Soviet system of Soviets, which is very clear. However, we know that the parliaments of various countries in Europe and the United States are organized by representatives publicly elected by the people. Here, what determines the victory or defeat of each party is the number of its representatives, that is, the number of votes it obtains from the people. This is a fair competition. If money is used in this process, it is bribery, which violates the law. It is even more inappropriate to rely on force. The law stipulates that the army belongs to the state and cannot be privately owned by a certain faction. Soldiers must resign and retire before they can run for election. Therefore, if China wants to implement democracy today and enter the stage of constitutional government, the parliamentary elections of various countries in Europe and the United States are undoubtedly a good example for us.</p>
<p>However, the Communist Party of China's position is different. It says: To organize a coalition government and participate in political power, the Communist Party must have a certain number of ministers, ten provincial chairmen, a certain number of troops, and a certain number of defense zones before elections can be held. Relying on existing military force and chanting the slogan of democracy, even to the point of using the country's Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army for political struggle, can this still be called democracy? To be frank, it is "democracy" in name, but "military rule" in reality! This is the old trick of feudal warlords demanding promotions and pay from the government! This is the greatest insult to the word "democracy" in today's people's century!</p>
<p>In short, if the Communist Party is interested in realizing democratic politics, it must abandon all claims to seize power and return the army to the central government of the country. Only then will it be right, otherwise, everything is an excuse and sophistry. The Kuomintang has declared that it will convene the National Assembly and "return power to the people." Why can't the Communist Party "return the army to the country"? The Communist Party must know that there are absolutely no elections in the world backed by force, nor is there so-called democracy in which the army manipulates the people. Whether the current civil unrest in China can be eliminated depends on whether the Communist Party can abandon its military force. Whether today's democracy in China can be realized also depends on whether the Communist Party can abandon its "military rule"! It is reported that the Negotiation Conference is being held heatedly, and I will watch it from this. (Chen)</p>

<h3>The Mission of Our Delegation to Siam</h3>
<p>— Ye Qiuyuan</p>
<p>Our delegation to Siam, led by Minister Li Tiezheng, left Chongqing at the beginning of the month, passed through Kunming and Hanoi, and arrived in Bangkok by special plane the other day. The Siamese government authorities, from the King down, have expressed a warm welcome and reception to the arrival of our delegation in Bangkok, which is indeed opening a new page in the history of Sino-Siamese relations. Although we have not yet seen the government's announcement of the mission of the delegation to Siam, it is generally observed that it is nothing more than to promote good neighborliness, so that the new situation in the Far East caused by the collapse of the Japanese invaders can be adjusted from the standpoint of Sino-Siamese relations, and how to strengthen the friendship between the two countries, etc. In today's international and domestic situation, when important events are unfolding continuously, the delegation's visit to Siam may not have received the attention it deserves. However, the mission undertaken by the delegation to Siam is very important. China's position and relations in the new situation in Southeast Asia, as well as the promotion of Sino-Siamese relations, all depend on the efforts of the delegation to Siam. Now, as the delegation arrives in Bangkok, I would like to discuss Sino-Siamese relations.</p>
<p>China and Siam are interdependent, and overseas Chinese account for almost one-third of the total population. Sino-Siamese relations have always been very friendly. Since the Japanese invaders attempted to create the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," Japan has sent the Fifth Column to carry out activities in Siam on a large scale. Some Siamese people consciously or unconsciously fell for the poison of Japanese propaganda, and the trend aroused the rise of narrow nationalism, renaming their country "Thailand" and imitating Hitler's style of "recovering lost land." They harbored the idea of annexing the ethnic groups residing in our Xifu border area, especially the "Baiyi" in Yunnan Province, and constantly incited them. Since Siam advocated the so-called "Greater Thai Race" movement, Sino-Siamese relations have been fraught with hidden reefs. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, "Thailand" officially became an appendage of the Japanese invaders. The interdependent China and Siam became enemy countries during the war. Under the rule of Luang Phibunsongkhram and his cronies, Siam tried its best to exclude Chinese people. Our overseas Chinese in Siam suffered all kinds of hardships. All of this left extremely unpleasant stains on Sino-Siamese relations. After the Japanese invaders accepted the Potsdam Declaration, Siam also surrendered to the United Nations. Unexpectedly, when Siam laid down its arms, Luang Phibunsongkhram's remnants even incited anti-Chinese sentiment, resulting in a large-scale massacre and looting of our overseas Chinese in Siam. The loss of life and property suffered by our overseas Chinese was extremely serious. At that time, domestic public opinion was full of indignation at Siam's anti-Chinese movement and demanded that the government, in addition to expressing condolences to the overseas Chinese, negotiate with Siam. Our delegation to Siam was formed and went abroad under such circumstances, shouldering its important mission.</p>
<p>The delegation to Siam is composed of members from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and other relevant departments. This visit to Siam, when an anti-Chinese movement occurred in Siam and our overseas Chinese suffered heavy losses, its first task is to express condolences to the overseas Chinese and investigate the truth of the incident in preparation for negotiations with the Siamese government. The number of our overseas Chinese in Siam has reached ten million, many of whom have made indelible achievements in the National Revolutionary Movement. For example, the late Xiao Focheng was the most representative figure. When we were forced to raise the banner of resistance against the enemy, our overseas Chinese in Siam either actively transported military supplies or actively participated in the anti-Japanese work, making a significant contribution to the war of resistance. Our National Government has always been extremely concerned about the welfare of overseas Chinese. Now that an anti-Chinese movement has occurred in Siam, our government has sent a delegation to Siam, and it is believed that it will definitely clear the name of the deceased overseas Chinese and actively protect the welfare of our overseas Chinese in Siam. The delegation's visit to Siam shows the government's concern for the welfare of overseas Chinese. Our overseas Chinese in Siam have endured long-term suffering under Siam's past tyranny. They should express their gratitude for the central government's kindness and encouragement, which goes without saying. I hope that our overseas Chinese, with the enthusiasm of participating in the revolution and participating in the war of resistance in the past, will continue to actively participate in the great cause of national construction, so as not to fail the government's expectations.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Sino-Siamese relations, China and Siam were enemies during the war, but now they are friends. We know that Siam's joining the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" also had its own unavoidable difficulties. With our broad-mindedness, we do not want to make a settlement. The Chairman of our National Government has repeatedly proclaimed to the world that our country has no territorial ambitions in Southeast Asia, which also includes Siam. Whether our government should demand compensation from the Siamese government for Siam's participation in the war is a matter for our government to weigh and is not something we want to discuss here. However, the Siamese government should be responsible for compensating for the losses suffered by our overseas Chinese in Siam during the war and after the war due to the anti-Chinese movement. At the same time, the Siamese government should strictly crack down on the Luang Phibunsongkhram clique and other anti-Chinese movements, so that our overseas Chinese in Siam will not suffer the same damage in the future. Moreover, all Siamese laws containing anti-Chinese meaning should be abolished, so as not to harm the legal rights of our overseas Chinese in Siam. All of these are necessary measures arising from the recent anti-Chinese movement in Siam. If the Siamese government intends to reform itself after the end of the war, it should not be difficult to find a way to resolve these issues and reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Siamese nations have historical origins, and the economic relationship between the two countries is extremely close. They should have exchanged envoys long ago and established normal diplomatic relations. It is a pity that the collusion of the Japanese invaders prevented the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Now the international situation is no longer what it used to be. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly proclaimed China's attitude towards various Asian nations to the world. We not only have no aggressive ambitions, but also want to act as elder brothers to support various Asian nations and jointly seek the welfare of mankind, especially the improvement of the welfare of the Asian people. Siam and China used to communicate tributes and also benefited from some Chinese culture. Now, on the occasion of the defeat and restoration of the country, it should renew its old friendship with its neighbors and continue to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Siamese nations that existed in the past. The number of Chinese children living in Siam has reached ten million. We hope that normal diplomatic relations between China and Siam can be established as soon as possible, and that the relationship between China and Siam, whether cultural, economic, or commercial, can be closer. This is not only related to the friendship between China and Siam but also to the prosperity and peace of East Asia.</p>
<p>The delegation to Siam, under the leadership of Minister Li Tiezheng, is going to Siam with a very important mission. Today's Siam has signed a treaty of peace with the United Kingdom. Although it has suffered territorial concessions and compensation, the signing of this treaty undoubtedly strengthens the power of the Siamese government. In addition, the US Secretary of State also had a statement on Siam, from which it can be seen that although Siam once participated in the Axis as an appendage, now that it has surrendered and restored the country, it has gradually become a member of the international community. Minister Li Tiezheng has extensive experience in Asian diplomacy. It is believed that this visit of our delegation to Siam will definitely achieve its mission.</p>

<h3>Less Speculative Activity, Mediocre Gold and Currency Trading, Old Hong Kong Dollar Returns Slightly to Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market continued to be stable, but because the Exchange Building was unusually tight on funds, large speculators wanted to pull the market up but were forced by the environment, so the process was extremely mediocre, with narrow fluctuations. At the opening in the morning, the rate for gold and currency in the capital was slightly better, although the number was extremely limited, but people felt satisfied. The market immediately rose slightly, and the US dollar did not improve with the gold market. The arbitrage price was still 625 yuan for ten taels. Securities firms made some arbitrage sales, and the supply of gold gradually increased, gradually returning from 939,000 to below 925,000. After that, the volume of transactions gradually decreased, and the market situation remained at around 930,000 until noon under the balance of supply and demand. In the afternoon, because the small markets stopped doing forward contracts, the spot market was extremely mediocre and still remained at around 930,000, a slight increase of 9,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry shops quoted gold ornaments at 100,000, silver bullion at 700 yuan, and silver dollars at around 460 yuan. Due to the large demand from securities firms, the interest rate was about 10.7 cents.</p>
<p>The foreign currency US dollar was very mediocre. Money shops continued to flow out of real goods, and it was difficult to break through the 1,500 mark. People gradually felt bored with the US dollar, so the market price hovered between 1,480 yuan and 1,490 yuan. Except for some hedging activities, there was a lack of speculative activity. At noon, it hovered around 1,490 yuan. There were no special changes in the afternoon, and the result was a slight increase of 7 yuan. The old Hong Kong dollar was bought and sold by Guangbang, with a slight supply, and the result was a small return of five yuan. The new goods in the market were extremely sluggish, once falling to around 73 yuan, and then slightly pulled up. The result was similar to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds, Ship Plates, Retail Investors Become Cautious</h3>
<p>The volume of public bond transactions is still difficult to recover. People in the industry are scattered, and retail investors have gradually become cautious. In addition, the voices of the authorities' intervention have become louder. Major investors believe that the current market price has reached the saturation point for future repayment in customs gold, and they are waiting for opportunities to recharge their batteries. Although there was a fluctuation of 260 yuan in half a day, the process was extremely mediocre. Although Type C opened flat, many parties came to sell, and the market fell to 1,550 yuan, and then it stabilized slightly. Customer gangs absorbed at low prices, and then rebounded by more than 100 yuan. At noon, it struggled at the 1,700 yuan mark. Miscellaneous brands were even inferior because the opening and closing were earlier. The result was a decrease of 160-170 yuan for Types A, B, D, and E compared to the previous close, and a decrease of 120 yuan for Type C.</p>
<h3>Scarce Supply of Rice, Good Sales of Flour</h3>
<p>The rice market in the interior has risen, and it has spread to Daoshen County. People's sentiment has turned bullish, and japonica rice has rebounded by 4-500 yuan. Indica rice has also risen by 2-300 yuan. The supply is scarce due to the rain, and the future trend is still bullish. The flour from the Yangtze River Gang continues to be procured, and the Nanyang flour is slightly taken, but it cannot match the sales, and it continues to rise by another 200 yuan. The oil market has seen more goods from Qingdao, and raw oil has weakened by another 6-700 yuan. Bean oil is scarce and still flat. Second-grade raw kernels have fallen by another 1,000 yuan. The price of liquor is settled, and soybean exports are normal. Local sales are not good, slightly down by 1-200 yuan.</p>
<p>According to (Dagong News Agency), the local food administration authorities are very concerned about the food supply for the people of this city. Recently, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, they are deeply worried that unscrupulous rice merchants will take the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the rice market. Therefore, in addition to issuing strict prohibitions, they have also purchased 1.5 million piculs of rice from rice-producing areas such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Wuxi, etc. The rice is shipped to Shanghai in batches and stored in warehouses. Two batches have already arrived, so the rice price is expected to be relaxed. In addition, the number of flour mills in this city that have resumed work is increasing, and the daily output has reached more than 20,000 bags. The wheat required for its raw materials is mostly wheat allocated to the factory by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for milling.</p>
<h3>Silk Price Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market learned that silk manufacturers would request raw material allocation, causing weakness in the spot market. The morning price for No. 120 Tianqiao was 1.32 million yuan, reaching a high of 1.356 million yuan, with a closing price of 1.33 million yuan, a slight decrease of 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Warehouse receipts initially traded at 980,000 yuan, eventually reaching 1.05 million yuan, an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon, and sentiment seemed weak. Due to high prices in Wuxi and Sri Lanka, factory costs increased sharply. With no goods shipped from Shanghai, prices remained firm. Silk goods experienced mixed fortunes, with minor fluctuations. American-Asian quilt covers were priced at 780,000 yuan per hundred, and Dachen crepe was priced at 2,420 yuan per yard, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. Minsheng brocade fabrics maintained the previous day's price.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Quiet, Poplin Sales Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw neither gains nor losses. Fine yarn and doubled yarn factories continued to purchase, with prices similar to the previous day. Sales of 20-count yarn were limited, with a slight decrease of around 5,000 yuan. Sentiment remained stable, and the overall trend was very quiet.</p>
<p>Due to the unexceptional yarn prices, and with the end of the year approaching, cotton mills and cotton merchants adopted a wait-and-see approach, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<p>Shirt poplin, mainly purchased by underwear companies, saw strong sales. Although a few manufacturers have started weaving their own, most underwear companies still rely on dyeing and weaving factories. Recently, Sichuan merchants have been actively buying, leading to a rise in prices. As for blue cloth and shilin cloth, factories have supply quotas, keeping the market stable.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Tea sales are typically slow during the winter season. However, this year has seen a reversal of the usual trend, with activity even exceeding previous years. Due to transportation difficulties from various regions, merchants have struggled to ship goods. Currently, transportation is relatively smooth, and demand from various regions is double that of the past. However, those with special grade teas are reluctant to sell due to the limited inventory in the city, leading to gradually rising prices as demand exceeds supply.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Loan Terms</h3>
<p>24-Month Term, Similar to Europe</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 18th] According to Export-Import Bank President Taylor, the bank's board of directors has approved a $33 million loan to China for the purchase of 275,000 to 300,000 bales of American cotton. The terms of this loan are largely the same as those for American cotton loans to European countries, except that the repayment period is 24 months after arrival, rather than 15 months. This extension is due to different transportation conditions on the Pacific Ocean and within China.</p>
<h3>Active Metal Transactions, Copper and Tin Show Signs of Recovery</h3>
<p>This month, copper, tin, and other metals have remained stable. Recently, however, there have been signs of recovery, with rising prices. Currently, spot tin is selling for 300,000 yuan per old dan, solder is selling for 140,000 yuan, pure tin is selling for 90,000 yuan, Canadian pig lead is selling for 40,000 yuan, and white lead is selling for 55,000 yuan. Copper bars, however, remain around 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Metal transactions have been active recently, with rising prices for almost all items, including clout nails, tinplate, lead wire, coiled wire, foreign silver dollars, leather, I-beams, and rebar. Prices have risen by 10-20% compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Shortage</h3>
<p>The asphalt market is increasingly active, but there is no spot oil available from any production area, leading to continuous price increases. According to communications from Jiaxing, a shipment of asphalt has already been sold for 27,000 yuan, with no spot goods available. Communications from Hangzhou indicate that prices have risen to 20,000 yuan, but supply cannot meet demand. Buyers from various places going to Hangzhou and Lanxi are all waiting, but the source is dwindling, leading to a significant shortage of spot oil. Therefore, local merchants in this city are selling this shipment of oil for 30,000 yuan, and Lanxi oil for 25,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Expansion of Lending Scope, Commercial Loans Can Be Considered</h3>
<p>[United Credit Bureau Report] Previously, in order to adapt to the financial and economic environment during the War of Resistance, the Four Joint Offices formulated principles stipulating that loans from various banks should be limited to industrial and mining production related to national defense and essential goods for people's livelihood. In September 1944, orders were given to various banks to cease ordinary commercial and merchant loans and discounts. This was because during the war, prices were high, commercial profits were substantial, and hoarding was widespread. To protect industrial and mining production, commercial loans were restricted. However, since the victory of the War of Resistance, prices in major cities have generally fallen, and all factors contributing to wartime commercial hoarding have disappeared. In the future, domestic and international transportation will become increasingly smooth, and industrial and commercial enterprises will be closely related. Industry and commerce are interdependent and should not be developed unevenly. It has been decided that loans from various banks should, within their professional scope, appropriately expand lending to relevant production and marketing enterprises, and gradually reduce interest rates to facilitate the flexibility of financial circulation. It is reported that various national banks have been notified to comply.</p>
<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>The price of foreign paper is firm, sales are active, and inventories are low, making it difficult for prices to fall in the short term.</p>
<p>The lumber market was relatively stable yesterday. It is reported that 100 liang of Hang lumber shipped from Hangzhou were sold at 46,000 yuan per liang. Several thousand liang are still in Hangzhou and will be shipped to Shanghai successively.</p>
<p>Among knitted goods, chrysanthemum undershirts are quite popular on the market, with prices higher than the previous day. Dafafa Towel Factory's price is 6,000 yuan, Dafafa Bed Sheet Factory's price is 6,800 yuan, while the market transaction prices are 5,800 yuan for towels and 6,700 yuan for bed sheets.</p>
<p>The price of American caustic soda continues to weaken. Yongli caustic soda is stable because the factory price has not decreased. The price of tallow caustic soda is slightly higher due to shortages.</p>
<p>Red Gold brand cigarettes are being distributed. It is rumored that British American Tobacco's Wing Tai Wo will also start distributing, causing prices to decline slightly. The prices of Chinese merchant cigarettes are mixed.</p>
<p>The customs authorities of the Ministry of Finance have stipulated that the dutiable value of imported taxable goods will be uniformly calculated based on the wholesale market price at the port of entry.</p>
<p>The Land Administration Bureau's land registration for the six districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Fahua, Caojing, and Hunan ended yesterday. To protect the rights of the people, the deadline has been extended by two months.</p>
<h3>Yong Yarn Leads the Way, Chinese Stocks Show Strength</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks have moved to the seventh floor for trading. Reports that the stock exchange will soon reopen have attracted a lot of miscellaneous funds. The market opened slightly stronger, but then hesitated as buyers sold off. Small-cap stocks briefly fell to near the previous day's closing price. However, Yong Yarn, fueled by rumors of a dividend of 180 yuan, consistently led the way. Eventually, other stocks were also boosted. Yong Yarn closed at a high price. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn rose 130 yuan, American-Asia rose 70 yuan, Xinyi rose 40 yuan, and the "Three Small" stocks each rose by half a percent. Less popular stocks have been slow to follow.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were stimulated by Chinese stocks, and funds flocked to buy them. Popular small-cap stocks were especially favored. However, sentiment among professionals was cautious, so the process was not as dazzling as that of Chinese stocks, and could only be described as stable. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Silk rose 50 yuan, Ewo Beer rose 70 yuan, Paper Industry rose 100 yuan, Jardine Matheson rose 100 yuan, and rubber stocks also showed prosperity.</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>From the War of Resistance to Victory: The Actual Situation of Social Education; The Number of National Social Education Institutions Has Increased Since Before the War</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chongqing] Before the War of Resistance, the number of national social education institutions under the Ministry of Education, such as the National Central Library, the National Peiping Library, the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum, and the National Palace Museum, was very small. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education actively promoted social education and spared no effort. By the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, in addition to the projects that had been successively completed, such as the Social Education Work Team and eight other units, the current national social education institutions have been adjusted as follows: (1) National Ritual and Music Hall, Director Wang Dong, located in Beibei, Chongqing. (2) National Central Library, Director Chiang Fu-tsung, located in Baisha, Chongqing, with a branch in Chongqing. During the recovery, Director Chiang was also commissioned by the Ministry of Education to go to Nanjing to assist in recovery work. At the same time, the library has partially resumed operations at Chengxian Street in Nanjing, with plans to relocate the entire library to Nanjing.

<h3>The Salary of a University Professor in Peiping is Not Thin</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 19th] The highest monthly salary of a professor at the Peiping Temporary Supplementary Class is only 6,000 legal tender. Starting in January of this year, it was increased to over 10,000 yuan. Now that the severe winter has arrived, the scholars are wearing thin clothes, and their poverty has reached its extreme.</p>
<h3>Reinstated Teachers in Nanjing Hold Registration and Review</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] In order to improve the quality of teachers, the Nanjing Municipal Government previously held qualifying examinations for primary and secondary school teachers, and those who passed have been hired. Recently, however, there have been rear-area returnees and pre-war teachers from Nanjing who have submitted petitions for reinstatement and assignment. In order to handle this in a unified manner, the authorities plan to organize teacher registration in the near future. The regulations are as follows: (1) Graduates of normal schools at all levels with proof (excluding graduates of normal schools run by the puppet government during the occupation period); (2) Pre-war teachers in Nanjing with certificates. Personnel with the above qualifications can register after the announcement date. Those who pass the review will be assigned and hired without examination.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps in this city, in order to strengthen training work, is holding a large-scale winter camp, recruiting 360 male and female students from universities and middle schools. The honorary camp commander is Qian Dajun, the camp commander is Wu Shaoshu, and the deputy camp commander is Wang Weijun. The camp is located in Nie Cheng Middle School on Jingzhou Road.

<h3>Inaugural Shanghai Basketball League Opens Tonight, Three Games in Group A for Women Starting at 6:30 PM at the City Gymnasium</h3>
<p>The inaugural Shanghai Basketball League, with 72 teams competing, is divided into Group A, Group B, and women's groups. The opening ceremony will be held at the City Gymnasium on South Shaanxi Road at 6:30 PM this afternoon, with three games. In the women's game, Dahua faces Xueqing. The former has veterans such as Huang Meijuan, and the addition of Rong Mozhen makes it even better. Xueqing's strength is mediocre, and it is likely to suffer a setback. The original game in Group A2 was Blue Team vs. Red Team, but because both the Blue Team and Renyu in Group A1 agreed and requested an exchange, with the permission of the Basketball Committee, the game has been changed to Renyu vs. Red Team. Renyu is the reincarnation of Chengyou, and the Red Team is the original Chengyou Red team. Meeting again is tantamount to infighting, and it is difficult to predict who will win. The final game is South China vs. the foreign soldiers of Sacco. South China's basketball skills have reached their peak, and there will definitely be a wonderful performance.</p>
<p>Three Announcements</p>
<p>Another Basketball Committee Announcement: (1) A specially made electric clock will be used for timing in this league to show fairness, but it is not intended to be adopted permanently. (2) This league emphasizes sportsmanship. At the end of each group, an election of athlete spirit will be held. Player certificates can be used as ballots. Players are encouraged to vote openly and not give up their rights.</p>
<p>Tickets for today are all priced at 300 yuan. The opening order list is as follows:</p>
<p>(Dahua) Huang Meijuan, Rong Mozhen, Ju Zhifang, Cheng Mulan, Cai Bingfang, Xue Weiyin, Xue Deyin, Huang Suzhen, Zhang Huifang, Shen Shuwei, Yang Renyun, Deng Qiyao.</p>
<p>(Xueqing) Qian Mengyue, Cao Laifeng, Shi Meifeng, Zhu Zhaozhen, Lin Xueying, Cao Xiaofeng, Bai Yufang, Liu Aidi, Ye Zhaolie, Jin Zifen, Xu Xiuyun, Luo Jiming.</p>
<h3>Negotiations to Borrow Yiyuan Stadium Are Underway, Fifth Meeting of the Football Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Football League Committee held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, and the resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The capacity of Jiaozhou Park Stadium is too small. During matches, it is difficult to maintain normal order when spectators attend. It is not possible to increase ticket prices to limit attendance, but there will be many important matches in the future, and it will be difficult to accommodate a large number of spectators. The proposal to rent the racecourse stadium has been rejected. Yiyuan Stadium is larger, and the proposal to borrow it is being negotiated by the executive director of the Municipal Sports Association, but no decision has been made yet. It was resolved to ask the executive board of directors of the Municipal Sports Association to proceed quickly, hoping to succeed in the near future for application.</p>
<p>(2) During the match between Xuhui B and Lianxing on January 13th, Xuhui used an unregistered player. The team was penalized with forfeiture, and Lianxing won 1-0. Xuhui was given a final warning.</p>
<h3>Donghua Meets Hequn in Today's Group A Football Match</h3>
<p>Held at Jiaozhou Park</p>
<p>Yesterday's three matches in Groups A and C were postponed due to rain. There are eight more matches today, starting at 10:00 AM. In Group A, the Soviet Union faces the Jews at 10:00 AM at Jiaoyuan. The Jews have gained Fu En this year, defeating Qingbai in one fell swoop and drawing with the British Navy in another match. There is great hope for victory today.</p>
<p>In another Group A match, Donghua faces Hequn for the first time. The match will be held at Jiaoyuan at 2:30 PM, with Deng Xiaoliang as the referee. Donghua's lineup was announced by Jia Youliang yesterday and remains the same.</p>
<p>However, Li Ning will not be able to play due to a foot injury. Zhang Lingen will move back to left back, and Zheng Yingquan will fill Zhang's position. The team's strength is strong. The young players of Hequn are also highly regarded. Their offense and defense are well-organized. Although they may not be able to defeat Donghua, there may be tense moments. Tickets are 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan. The complete order list for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, Zhang Lingen, Song Lingsheng, Fu Shi, Zhuang Youren, Zheng Yingquan, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Zhan Jing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang</p>

<h3>Chairman Pan Gongzhan Broadcast Yesterday, Appealing for Education Loans</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] The New Voice Radio Station, sponsored by the Shanghai Education Association, officially opened yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at 159 Beijing Road. More than 500 people attended, including Director Gu of the Education Bureau, Deputy Director Ge of the Social Affairs Bureau, Deputy Director Chen of the Land Administration Bureau, and representatives from the education and news industries.</p>
<p>Director Gu's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Director Gu gave the opening speech, elaborating on radio education. Shu Xincheng then spoke on "Using Ears Instead of Eyes to Accelerate National Construction," and Zhou Yaocheng spoke on "The Significance of Broadcast Education." Gao Erbo spoke on "Education Loans." At about 4:00 PM, Chairman Pan Gongzhan arrived gracefully. After a short rest, he made a sincere broadcast. His words were so poignant that the audience in the broadcasting room was moved to tears. The main points of his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Listeners! Today, I am invited by the New Voice Radio Station of the Shanghai Education Association to appeal for education loans. Although there are many schools in Shanghai, due to the government's economic difficulties, public schools cannot be universally established. Private schools also have to increase tuition fees because teachers are struggling to make a living. You have probably seen the tuition fee regulations for the next semester in recent newspapers. The tuition fee is set at a maximum of 16,000 yuan for senior high school, 12,000 yuan for junior high school, and 8,000 yuan for primary school. Compared to pre-war tuition fees at current prices, it can be said that it has not increased much. However, even with this not so high tuition fee, how many people can afford it? How many will be excluded? In the past, the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers had loan programs, which helped thousands of poor students. However, both newspapers have stopped their loan programs. How will these thousands of poor students continue their studies in the future? How can you sit idly by and watch them drop out of school? If the government's economy allows, then not only 10,000, but even 100,000 people, the government should be responsible for. However, after eight years of resistance, the government's finances are extremely difficult. In the future, everything needs to be rebuilt, and money is needed everywhere. Although it is known that "education is the first priority," there are even more important and urgent needs, and it is difficult to enumerate them. How can we take care of poor students? Looking back at the current situation in Shanghai, I feel that luxury and extravagance are even worse than before the war. Those who made a fortune during the enemy and puppet regime are now making a fortune from the victory. Hoarding and speculation are prevalent, and their influence is pervasive. The few who have become rich are becoming more extravagant and indulgent, while the majority of the poor are living in deep water and hot fire, crying out without anyone to help. However, I dare to say that this kind of畸形 abnormal and unreasonable phenomenon will not last long. Those who only know how to benefit themselves and not help others will not have good consequences. Think about it, can these oppressed and deprived young people be guaranteed not to rebel? Therefore, I hope that you can donate generously with the intention of saving others and saving yourselves, give money if you have money, and give effort if you have strength, in order to reduce your own sins and at the same time accumulate virtue for your children and grandchildren. Now I am broadcasting this message with this intention, and I deeply hope that you can support it vigorously.</p>
<h3>Official Letter of Clarification</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In response to a news item published in your esteemed newspaper on the 18th of this month, which is utterly untrue, we hereby clarify that our factory's current premises are leased from a landlord who has repeatedly stated the need to reclaim the property for personal use. Consequently, in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], we purchased three buildings at 578, 584, and 588 Avenue Haig [now Huashan Road] to serve as factory space. We requested the Daozhong Girls' School to vacate the premises or to sign a lease agreement. Daozhong School not only vehemently refused through its Japanese teachers but also entrusted the pseudo-lawyer Zhang Zhuochen to deposit a small portion of the rent into the pseudo-court, which our factory was unable to accept, causing us immense distress. Since the unconditional surrender of the enemy, we have appealed to the court for mediation, which was ignored. We further requested Lawyer Yu Chuanding to mediate, also without success. We were compelled to seek redress through the court but, out of consideration for the educational undertaking, requested that the evacuation and handover of the premises be delayed until the summer vacation of this year. This is the factual account of the matter. We respectfully request your esteemed newspaper to publish this correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Star Perfume Factory</p>

<h3>"National Construction Requires Building Tobacco Industry" - General Bai Chongxi's Inspection Speech</h3>
<p>General Bai Chongxi, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday, inspected the New Sixth Army and the Youth Army in the afternoon and addressed all officers and soldiers. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The eight-year War of Resistance has finally achieved victory. This is due to the effective leadership of the commander-in-chief and the success of the war-resistant decision-making, but it is also due to the struggle and sacrifice of all our officers and soldiers and the Allied forces, and the victory won with blood and heads. This is a major outcome in this World War that cannot be erased. We have won victory after eight years of bloody battles, but after victory, there are still many difficult problems in front of China. We must complete the work of building the army and the country. To build a modern country, we must build</p>
<p>Modern Army The chairman showed us that to build a modern army, we must: (1) Thoroughly implement the three words "new," "fast," and "real." We need new equipment and new training. Use "soldiers are expensive and fast," the army must be mechanized. We must do it in a down-to-earth manner, we must be "real," not superficial. (2) Modern army is built on science. In the future, I hope that every officer and soldier will study more in academic aspects. (3) Strict discipline, and (4) compliance with the law.</p>
<p>In addition, the New Sixth Army will soon be ordered to go to the Northeast to take over the defense. There are still many reefs in the Northeast. After the New Sixth Army arrives in the Northeast, it must take on the heavy responsibility of protecting the Northeast and protecting China's national defense. The 207th Division is an intellectual youth army, and the chairman attaches great importance to young people joining the army</p>
<p>Very important Recently, the Ministry of Political Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Military Training, and relevant ministries have decided in a meeting that the Youth Army will receive reserve officer education. If we want to mobilize the whole country and implement a full-scale war, we must quickly establish a reserve officer military system. Therefore, I am preparing for a national mobilization. We must prepare a large number of cadres. The 207th Division is the first phase of reserve officers and a new era in Chinese history.</p>
<p>Finally, General Bai said that when I was ordered to go to Nanjing this time, the chairman instructed the wooden people to convey to you everything he usually said to the troops. The chairman cannot come to every place to inspect because of official duties. I would like to extend my condolences to you on behalf of the chairman.</p>
<h3>US Troops in China Will Gradually Decrease - Establishment of Advisory Group Awaits - General Wedemeyer Holds Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the US China Theater, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Cathay Hotel on the eighth floor at 11:30 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Continue to Maintain Designated Policies</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of repatriating US troops from China, General Wedemeyer stated: The US China Theater Command and its affiliated teams, officers, and soldiers will continue to perform their duties in China in the current months. When a reporter asked whether the China Theater was preparing to reduce the number of troops stationed in accordance with Washington's recent decision, General Wedemeyer replied that the China Theater Commander intended to continue to maintain the necessary number of people and troops in China in order to implement the policies designated by Washington. General Wedemeyer also stated that after the discharged soldiers were sent back to the United States, other soldiers would be transferred from the United States to China to replace them. However, it is currently unlikely that the total number of US troops in China will increase. Another reporter asked how Washington's recently promulgated demobilization order would affect the number of US troops stationed in China. General Wedemeyer replied that the number of US troops stationed in China would gradually decrease in the future to form a military advisory group stationed in China.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer answered reporters' questions regarding the reasons for the delayed establishment of the US military advisory group in China, saying that the United States and China or other countries were in the same situation during this war. That is, many more important domestic and international problems must be solved, and under the pressure of time, slightly less important problems have to be delayed.</p>
<p>Don't Overemphasize Demonstration Movements</p>
<p>A reporter asked: This time the Chinese students' demonstration movement is purely due to other reasons, but some US military personnel believe it is an anti-American movement. I wonder if the US military headquarters has received an explanation from the Chinese authorities? General Wedemeyer said: I have not received an official or non-official statement from China. However, the US Stars and Stripes newspaper published an article last Friday, pointing out that this demonstration movement is not anti-American. General Wedemeyer and the wooden people believe that after every war, there will inevitably be such demonstration movements all over the world, and we don't have to take them too seriously. The scale of these various demonstrations is larger than before, because the scale of this war is larger than before. This is an expression of public opinion and should not be suppressed by force. However, if anyone goes beyond its scope and disrupts order, the authorities will have to intervene.</p>
<p>Cooperate to the End Before and After the War</p>
<p>Last week, a newspaper reported that a Class A war criminal was arrested by the US military authorities. Several Russians in this city were also abused by the Japanese criminal when they were previously imprisoned in the Qiaotou Building, and they demanded that he be sentenced. However, according to the US authorities, the US will only handle incidents of abuse of US troops, and accusations from other countries will not be controlled. General Wedemeyer stated that this was not true. The United States and other allied countries cooperated during the war, and they should also cooperate after the war to achieve world peace. If they do not cooperate with each other, they will not be able to implement the peace plan stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Mr. Wei decided to deal with this matter in accordance with the regulations on war criminal investigations.</p>
<p>Request the Chairman for Permission to Cover News</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that US reporters went to work in the Shenyang area, but the Cao Chinese authorities refused, saying that the Soviet Union did not want the beauty to go, but the Central News Agency reporters can still pass. They hoped that General Wei could assist them. Mr. Wei said: I not only hope that American reporters can go, but also that all other countries' reporters can go to work in the Northeast together. I will send a telegram to Chairman Jiang this afternoon to request permission.</p>
<p>Trip to North China Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>When a conflict occurred, General Wei said that he had sent a letter to Mayor Qian, expressing his willingness to continue to cooperate with the Chinese authorities. Because the previous cooperation was very good, and we should strive to maintain it in the future. Although the Chinese administrative authorities may have made mistakes in the past, or may make mistakes in the future, he himself greatly admired and praised them for being able to manage this large metropolis with a large population with very little experience and achieve such good results.</p>
<p>The date for the trial of Japanese war criminals has not yet been decided, but newspaper reporters should be allowed to attend at that time. Also, when Marshal Marshall will come to Shanghai is not yet known. After the marshal arrives, a press conference will be held.</p>
<p>Because General Wei has been busy with official duties recently, his trip to North China is bound to be delayed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Authorities to Revise Income Tax Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to request that the current income tax law be re-revised, cabled the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday. It should be requested that the current situation in the recovered areas and the changes in currency value over the past few years should be taken into consideration, and it is necessary to re-revise it urgently. In addition, the method of tax collection in the recovered areas should also be simplified and revised.</p>
<h3>Military Vehicle and Motorcycle Collide - Stray Bullets Injure People</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At about 4:15 pm yesterday at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, three military trucks came in a row. Suddenly, a machine-powered military vehicle in front stopped moving when the red light was open. The two armies collided, causing the motorcycle to overturn slightly. The soldiers on the truck擁下反將揪住痛毆 and fired several guns, and a stray bullet hit the chest of Xu Yonglin, a driver in another car, and the situation was very serious. After the police on duty sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, although the doctor tried to remove the bullet, his life was in danger. It was later learned that the injured was a driver from the Central Bank.</p>
<p>At around 11:00 pm last night, a black-brand car with the number 11761 was speeding along the gate of the Songhu Garrison Command on North Sichuan Road, knocking down a top-ranking soldier, Yao Changxing, breaking his nose. The police from the Hongkou Branch drove the car that caused the accident into the branch, and the injured was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the French Tram Workers' Strike - Full Service Resumes Yesterday - Employers Give Bonus of 10,000 Yuan Per Person</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The French Tram Company has been on strike for four days. After mediation by the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers, in order to take care of the overall situation, convened a general meeting of all employees yesterday morning and accepted the mediation. The negotiations were completed at 10:30, and all trams and buses resumed service on all lines at 11:00. The terms are that the employer will pay each worker a prize of 10,000 yuan, and each person will be paid 5,000 yuan for the four days of the strike.

<p>Reported Cases Transferred to the High Procuratorate</p>
<p>The employees reported to the company's general manager, Jules Claes, that he had presented the Japanese side with 15 buses, 5 large engines, and a large number of gasoline, diesel, tire, etc. during the fall. This case was originally scheduled to be heard at 1:00 pm yesterday. Seven employee representatives arrived on time, but Jules Claes was not summoned. It was not until 3:15 that the prosecutor asked him and said that the nature of this case did not fall within the scope of the Procuratorate's Office of the Local Court, and that he would report to the High Procuratorate. The workers still intend to continue to report to the High Procuratorate and post slogans, demanding that the government take over the French water and electricity companies into state ownership.</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Kexin Makes a Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday, Deputy Director Ge Kexin of the Social Affairs Bureau made a special statement on this case as follows: After investigating the demands made by the workers this time. (1) The wage issue, the city will decide on a unified method to increase or decrease with reference to the cost of living index. (2) The year-end bonus has been handled by the company as usual and should not be required again. This kind of extraneous branch is really wrong. As for the workers’ reporting to the government, they should comply with legal procedures and submit documents and ask the judicial authorities to verify them, and should not be discussed together. The company’s unauthorized interruption of the current without the approval of the authorities is also inappropriate during the mediation period of the bureau. In short, regarding labor-management disputes, the municipal council has decided that they should be handled in accordance with the Law on the Handling of Labor-Management Disputes. During the mediation period, both labor and management shall not strike, slack off, or suspend business. In the future, the city will not allow the same incident to happen, and we will strictly ban it.</p>
<h3>Two Traitors Who Harmed American Officers Are on Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zou Wenxian, 37 years old, is a native of Shishan. Shi Huiyao, 62 years old, is eight miles from Haimen. Both live in the Baoshan County. Recently, the Procuratorate of the High Court prosecuted them in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Lv Zou was slightly familiar with Japanese. From 1938 to 1943, he worked as a translator in the Baoshan Enemy Propaganda Class. Shi served as the captain of the pseudo-guard team in Baoshan County from October 1940 until the victory. One night in February 1942, two American military officers and a translator surnamed Liu escaped from the concentration camp set up by the enemy army in Yangxing Town and took refuge in the home of Li Lansheng, a villager, waiting for the night to come. Unexpectedly, the incident was leaked and discovered by the neighbor, who told Zou Wenxian, who reported it to the enemy liaison officer Oshima and Shi Huiyao. The guard team rushed to search for the two American military officers and Liu, and then handed them over to the Wusong enemy gendarmerie for detention. After learning of the incident, our Su Zhejiang Pioneer Army Songhu Mobile Corps arrested the two defendants after the victory, sent them to the Garrison Command, and then transferred them to the Procuratorate. The defendants confessed to having held pseudo-positions. The case was opened in the special criminal court of the High Court yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Zonghai. The two defendants hesitated in their confessions, denied that they had led the arrest of escaped Allied forces, and asked lawyers Yao Xichao and Liu Shichao to defend them. Then they asked the storytellers Li Lansheng and Li Azhen and his wife to prove that two allied soldiers and one Chinese were hiding in their wood shed and were later captured by the Japanese. The court ordered the defendants to be sent back to prison and rescheduled for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Wang Shiliang's Case Re-trialed</p>
<p>Wang Shiliang, a former printing worker of the Sino-American-Japanese Daily, served as an informant of the enemy's Shanghai East Gendarmerie after the Pacific War. He secretly reported the arrest of Xu Zhong, a member of the Chuan Democratic Youth League. He was released after the victory, and Wang Shiliang was reported and arrested by the authorities. The case was retried by President Liu Yugui yesterday morning. The perpetrator still refused to tell the truth. Then he asked the victim Xu Zhongchang, who was brought to the case, to confront him. The perpetrator had lowered his head and remained silent. The court decided to investigate and interrogate again, and the defendant was sent back to prison.</p>
<p>The Prosecution of Li Ze by Jian Ju has been Filed</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited the First Patrol Team of the Salt Inspectorate. Regarding the case of Shu Yueqiao reporting the traitor Li Ze, the team has conducted repeated investigations and obtained a lot of gains, and testified to the progress of the plaintiff Shu Yueqiao's report and prosecution. After comprehensive investigation, the processing procedure of the wooden case is still in compliance. Now that the preliminary investigation by the High Procuratorate has been completed, a public prosecution has been filed and the case can be tried according to law within days.</p>
<p>Interrogation of Chang's Unrighteous Conduct Completed</p>
<p>After the victory, Zhang Tao, the president of the pseudo-Supreme Court, was arrested by the authorities in mid-September. His sons, Su Chang, Su Kang, Su Xing, and Su Ding, fled to other places and hid. Su Xing had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin recently. At 11:30 am on the 17th, he was arrested by the police from the Dising Road Police Branch at the intersection of Henan Road and Tianjin Road. According to the confession, he is from Hangzhou and is thirty years old. He studied at Daxia University and lived at 693 West Aimes Road. He once served as a "pseudo-municipal legal advisor." At that time, he was recommended by Sheng Youhui and concurrently served as the chief inspector of the Hongji Shantang (selling opium) to check private soil. There are also more than 400,000 deposits in the China and other banks. It is reported that the other two brothers of the rebel, Su Kang, and the brother Su Ding, are both colluding with the Japanese and are doing all kinds of evil. The four rebels each drove a car in the enemy era and went in and out of international hotels such as New Asia, behaving luxuriously. The police station has completed the interrogation and has transferred them to the High Court for punishment. Shen Jiucheng's son Wanling, the general manager of Shengsheng Ranch, was also sent to the criminal court of the High Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Victory Ship Flag Change Ceremony Presided Over by Xu Xueyu Himself</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau received the Victory Ship (formerly named Wichitafalls), now named Hai Su. The reception was originally scheduled for the 17th, but was temporarily delayed due to the issue of crew salary levels. It was officially held yesterday afternoon. The American side also sent representatives to the bureau to meet with shipowner Shi Erchang, Chief Mate Shi Xingfu, and Chief Engineer Li Bingzhang and other crew members, taking a small boat to the ship. The Fang representative completed the handover with simple procedures. Xu Xueyu also personally went to the ship to hold the flag change ceremony. The ship's gross tonnage is 4,095 tons, with a deadweight of 2,560 tons. The ship is 261 feet long and has a speed of 10 knots. The ship's equipment is still in wartime configuration, and wartime equipment such as gun emplacements must be dismantled. Because it is a cargo ship, there are very few passenger seats, and it will need to be refitted in the future. The sailing route has not yet been assigned. The handover procedures will take some time, as there is a large amount of equipment on board that needs to be received one by one. There are also three Victory Ships and six Liberty Ships waiting to be handed over.</p>
<h3>Opium and Drug Poisoning in Recovered Areas Must Be Eradicated within Six Months</h3>
<p>The Central Government believes that in the recovered areas, during the enemy puppet period, the establishment of Opium Prohibition Bureaus, the public sale of opium, and the encouragement of people to smoke were blatant, causing great harm. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior drafted "Measures for Eradicating Opium and Drug Poisoning in Recovered Areas," which were approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation. In all recovered provinces and cities, regardless of whether people plant, transport, sell, smoke, manufacture, or store opium and drugs, all must be completely prohibited within six months from the date of the announcement.</p>
<h3>More Than 5,000 Factories Have Resumed Electricity</h3>
<p>Since November 10th of last year, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has lifted restrictions, and anyone wishing to reconnect or install new power can apply directly to the company. It is learned that more than 5,000 factories and manufacturing plants have been approved to resume electricity.</p>
<h3>Gas Ration Increase to 45 Cubic Meters</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of other fuels in the city, the original quota of 20 cubic meters of gas per household was insufficient. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau instructed the gas company to improve its methods. The new method has been approved, stipulating that the price of gas be calculated at 190 national currency units per cubic meter (100 cubic feet) according to cost, and the limit per household be increased from 20 to 45 cubic meters. The over-limit price will be reduced by 50% as originally stipulated. That is, for residential users, the charge is 4 national currency units per cubic meter (originally 800 national currency units per cubic meter). For industrial users, the charge is 750 national currency units per cubic meter (originally 1,500 national currency units per cubic meter). Therefore, although the unit price has increased by 90% compared to the original quota, the burden on users is actually reduced. Taking a consumption of 45 cubic meters as an example, according to the old method, the basic quota was 20 cubic meters, and the remaining 25 cubic meters should be calculated at the over-limit price, requiring a total payment of 12,000 national currency units. However, under the new standard, only 8,550 national currency units are required. This method is approved to be effective from January 4th of this year.</p>
<h3>China Railway Management Committee Announces the Current Situation of the Shanghai Railway Area and Limited Vehicles Maintain Trunk Line Transportation</h3>
<p>The China Central Railway Management Committee yesterday announced its work situation and the general railway situation over the past three months as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that railway transportation cannot be delayed for a moment. The original principle for assigning personnel to take over railways in various regions was to temporarily maintain the business areas under enemy puppet management for separate takeover and management. Less reorganization of business institutions means less delay in the continuation of traffic. During the enemy puppet era, the Central China Railway Company administered the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou line, the Nanjing-Wuhu section of the Jiangnan line, and the Hangzhou-Zhuji section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. It had four bureaus in Shanghai, Nanjing, Bengbu, and Jinhua. After the takeover, adjustments were made according to this business area. The Central China Railway Management Committee was established, and the bureaus were abolished. The committee has departments such as transportation, engineering, and factory affairs directly managing the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Separate general managers were set up for the Pukou-Xuzhou-Hangzhou-Zhuji-Southern sections to manage the affairs of the entire section under the committee's direction. The Beijing-Wuhu section was returned to the Jiangnan Company for independent management. Among the lines, the Beijing-Shanghai line is the most important and the most watched by society. Now that the Ministry of Communications has completed the takeover of all railways, it will divide the national railways into nine major regions, which will be implemented soon. Regarding the general situation of the Beijing-Shanghai region and the Beijing-Shanghai line, the following is added.</p>
<p>Rectification Process Before the takeover, the two lines were in chaos, the stations were corrupt, black hats humiliated passengers, and baggage handlers filled the tops of cars, fully demonstrating the state of affairs when the Japanese invaders were about to be defeated. Everyone knew about the abandonment and chaos. As for the maintenance of the tracks and the maintenance of locomotives, some Chinese may think that the Japanese had advanced technology and took things seriously, so there must be something to see. But in fact, it was far from the case. Before the war, the Beijing-Shanghai express train originally took five and a half hours. However, the puppet "Central China Railway" paid no attention to the necessary work to maintain traffic, such as the annual allocation of funds to replace railroad ties. Most of the railroad ties were damaged. Unless one-third of them, or 160,000, were replaced, the pre-war driving speed could not be restored. If the railroad ties were not replaced first, increasing the speed would be dangerous.</p>
<p>As for the two most important things related to locomotive maintenance and coal economy: (1) hot water boiler washing, and (2) clean water supply, the puppet "Central China Railway" completely abandoned them and turned a blind eye. Each water supply station on the two lines originally paid great attention to using "soft surface water," that is, river water that had not been in excessive contact with the soil. Its calcium content was very low, and there was less hard scale in the boiler tubes. Hard scale in the boiler tubes not only hinders heat transfer and increases coal consumption but also increases the local temperature of the boiler tubes and shortens their life, which is the greatest enemy of locomotive maintenance and coal economy. Taking Nanjing Station as an example, before the war, the coal port was dredged every year, and river water was used to maintain a clean water source for the locomotives. Since the occupation, it had not been dredged for eight years, and it was completely silted up. The river source was cut off, and turbid Qin Huai hard water was used. Therefore, at the beginning of the takeover, not only were things chaotic in terms of order and personnel, but also in terms of track, locomotives, and vehicles, technology and maintenance were in a complete mess.</p>
<p>Thirty days after the takeover, a personnel reform was launched, and the most inferior black hats, numbering in the thousands, were dismissed in one day, which was welcomed by society. All order restoration work could be carried out smoothly. The chaos and dirt of the past have become a thing of the past. Hot water boiler washing and water supply projects are also being actively carried out. However, due to the extreme shortage of locomotives and passenger cars, passenger transport congestion has not been reduced. The 160,000 railroad ties must come from overseas, so it is impossible to restore the pre-war driving speed for a while.</p>
<p>The puppet "Central China Railway" was derelict in its duties, and there were very few trains. After Commissioner Chen Bozhuang was ordered by Commander-in-Chief He on September 20 to implement military takeover, he immediately increased the number of trains. One pair of fourth-class trains was added to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to alleviate the baggage handler situation. One pair was also added to the Shanghai-Wuxi section. After the official establishment of the committee on October 1, although military transport was extremely busy, the number of trains continued to increase. Before the Beijing-Shanghai line was taken over, there were ten trains a day, and now there are eighteen. Before the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was taken over, there were four trains a day, and now there are eight. The Beijing-Shanghai Road was already the busiest road for passenger transport before the war. After the victory, due to various reasons, passenger transport exceeded 44% of the pre-war level. Although all existing vehicles are now in use, they are still in short supply. At present, the average number of passengers carried by each vehicle is equal to two and a half vehicles before the war, creating congestion at the stations and in the cars. If you want to restore the old appearance, a large number of new vehicles must be imported, which is beyond the capabilities of the road administration. The statistics for Beijing-Shanghai passenger transport in the past three months compared with before the war are as follows:</p>
<p>The current authorities have requested the Ministry of Communications to quickly allocate locomotives and vehicles in accordance with the relief plan, so as to restore the old appearance as soon as possible and seek improvement.</p>
<p>Improving Treatment All transportation employees have suffered from low wages since the war of resistance, especially railway employees, because the railway income and expenditure are too incomparable, so their salaries are thinner than other transportation industries. The current standards for railway staff and technician treatment set by the Ministry of Communications are quite different from the cost of living in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The reasons for this are: (1) The treatment standards are based on the conditions of the Yuehan, Xianggui, and Longhai roads. (2) Any administrative or business agency's treatment methods always lag behind actual price changes, not just the railways. Moreover, due to regulations, there are often situations where we seek methods in the absence of methods and cut our feet to fit our shoes. In particular, the fact that the wages of railway technicians cannot be increased to 60 times that of the staff makes the Beijing-Shanghai authorities feel difficult. When the takeover was in October, the Minister of Communications personally instructed that living expenses should be temporarily issued and handled in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated treatment after the Ministry's treatment was promulgated. In November, when the Ministry's promulgated measures were received, it was deeply felt that they were too divorced from the actual situation. On the one hand, living expenses were issued five times in three months. On the other hand, the implementation of the Ministry's regulations was carefully studied. The Ministry's regulations divide technicians into three grades: A, B, and C. Not only are there too few grades, but the total allowances calculated according to the regulations are only more than 14,000 yuan at the highest. Among the staff, the class of affairs is the most numerous, but it is only more than 18,000 yuan, which is not enough for actual needs. Therefore, it was resolutely decided to temporarily set a temporary subsidy outside the Ministry's regulations. In addition to submitting it to the Ministry for verification, it was immediately released. For example, this temporary subsidy has been approved by the Ministry. However, the calculation methods used in the Ministry's regulations are always too trivial and difficult to match reality. It is heard that a new case of employee treatment will be proposed at the Railway Conference.</p>
<p>Current Plan The principle adopted in the division of national railways into nine regions this time is the trunk line system. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Region includes Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Jiangnan-Nanjing-Jiangxi, a total of four lines before the war, connecting the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. In the east, it is the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou, and in the west, it is Guixi in Jiangxi, connecting to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road. From Shanghai to Guixi, it will be a trunk line in the Beijing-Shanghai region, connecting to the Yuehan in the south, Xiangqian in the west, and Sichuan in the north. Before the war, the Beijing-Jiangxi line had been built to Huizhou, and the earthwork and stonework engineering from Huizhou to Guixi had also been completed by 80% to 30%. The sections of this area that were dismantled by the enemy puppets include the Ningbo section, the Sujia section, and the Jiangnan-Nanjing-Jiangxi section, leaving only the Nanjing-Wuhu section. Now, the Jingguo Road and Danglu Road have been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to plan the rehabilitation and reconstruction plan of this region, which will be submitted to the Railway Conference in the near future. It is heard that the general outline is: (1) Restore the equipment and driving speed of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines before the war. (2) Repair the Jiangnan-Nanjing-Jiangxi line to Guixi this year, making it a transportation line for repairing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road within Jiangxi Province, so as to promote traffic rehabilitation and rescue material transfers.</p>

<h3>Domestic Costume Films and Local Drama</h3>
<p>— Tang Shaohua</p>
<p>A strange thing becomes ordinary when people get used to it.</p>
<p>But if we feel uncomfortable with ordinary events, we can turn corruption into magic. Others are accustomed to it and feel at ease, but we think it is extremely strange.</p>
<p>New novels were not popular yet, and everyone was reading old novels about talented scholars and beautiful women. So the men learned to write poetry, drink, and visit prostitutes, thinking it was the style of famous scholars - famous scholars and talented scholars were the same in essence but different in name. Melon-skin hats, silk jackets, double-nosed satin shoes, white socks, and most importantly, a ribbon tied around the ankle, walking around like a worldly gentleman. The women had to stay in their boudoirs, only allowed to peek behind the window, parting a slit in the bead curtain, looking for talented scholars passing by on the road during the day. If they took a fancy to someone, they would "accidentally" drop a fan or a poem, and meet in the back garden. But when they met, they had nothing to say, wiping away tears and going back to write poetry.</p>
<p>When new literature emerged, talented scholars and beautiful women also followed the revolution. Poetry was changed to new poetry, wine was changed to champagne and brandy... The most complicated change was the psychological reform, with roses replacing red beans as a symbol of love; the back garden was also confiscated and turned into a park. Meetings in the park were not just about moonlight and tears, but sometimes also involved kneeling (in the foreign style), hugging, and kissing. The ideal beautiful woman was not pale and melancholy, and the talented scholar also changed into a suit, along with the posture that should accompany the suit.</p>
<p>Speaking of this new posture, translated novels have never explained it clearly. To learn, fortunately, there are Hollywood movies.</p>
<p>New novels cultivated the "modern" psychology of new talented scholars and beautiful women; and imported movies guided the appearance of new youth. So those who had never been abroad had a more skilled way of holding knives and forks than real foreign old women, and the beautiful women sometimes learned incorrectly, such as wearing a white fox coat for a high-class evening party during the day, and eating snacks with a talented scholar in the dusty streets...</p>
<p>If you get used to these, they are not surprising; because everyone reads the same novels and watches the same movies.</p>
<p>One day, when you walk into a group of people who have not seen these movies and novels, you will be surprised by the different postures of their movements. These different postures are truly indescribable. For example, winking, pointing at something with the index finger extended, while the little finger also extends; twisting the waist and wiggling the buttocks when happy or unhappy, biting the corner of the handkerchief on the lips, peeking at the toes with the corner of the eye...</p>
<p>These postures may have been passed down from the grandmother, but where did the grandmother learn this look? If you get used to it, it's not surprising, so no one cares about it.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when you step into a local opera theater, you see many hermaphroditic historical figures on the stage (because it's a historical drama). Their movements, postures, and voices are exactly the things of the grandmother's generation. Because of local opera, we naturally think of domestic costume films. Aren't those performed in domestic costume color films also the emotions of the grandmother's generation? Movies also have their disciples, and domestic costume films and local operas also have their disciples. Perhaps their schools are different, so the learning style (?) is also very different.</p>
<p>Which one is better? Everyone gets used to their own, so they don't find it strange anymore, and they are too lazy to care.</p>
<p>However, if you think the look of the grandmother's generation is not modern enough, I think that to improve domestic films and local operas, we must not only transform their content to make those psychological elements of talented scholars and beautiful women more realistic and stronger, and catch up with the times. At the same time, those twisted and grotesque appearances must also be thoroughly clarified to meet the requirements of the new national appearance.</p>
<p>As for giving roses and opening champagne, there are many people who write about new literature and film, so I won't say much here.</p>
<p>[End] The prevailing atmosphere "China Electric" Troupe General Assembly Record - Proverbs</p>
<h3>The Democratic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— A Maxim</p>
<p>The entire "China Electric" theater troupe has arrived, and several actors have also been recruited in Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 15th, "China Electric" held a general meeting, bringing together both old and new members to discuss all issues after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The location was the general management office of the Central Film Studio on Haig Road. Shortly after 2 o'clock, in addition to the Chongqing contingent staying at the Qiu's residence, the newly joined Shen Hao, Bi Yun Sally, Lin Bin, Lu Shan, Feng Zhe, Ying Yu, and Yang Yingwu also arrived one after another. The original screening room had been converted into a temporary conference room with a T-shaped conference table, white tablecloths, flowers, and plenty of delicious Western pastries, melon seeds, peanuts, and the like. More than 30 people were seated, rather squeezed together.</p>
<p>Zhang Junxiang, the secretary of the "China Electric" theater troupe, stood up first and announced the significance of convening the meeting. He began by saying, "We didn't originally plan to have refreshments, but some of the gluttons requested them, so we prepared some. Now that we have them, we must politely offer them, even though they are very simple!" Then, he got to the point, stating that the purpose of the meeting was threefold: "First, a group of new colleagues from Shanghai have joined our group. Mr. Luo may or may not know these people. Here, I would like to introduce these new colleagues to Mr. Luo. Second, our old and new colleagues can also get to know each other, which will make our work easier in the future. Third, in order to solve our living difficulties, adjust the monotony of life, and maintain a regular lifestyle, we used to have a living committee. In order to discuss performance matters and improve our artistic cultivation, we used to have an art committee. Now, firstly, the term of our original committee members has expired, and secondly, we have moved to a new environment. The organization and personnel need to be decided and elected here. Now, let's first ask Mr. Luo to say a few words to us."</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Xuelian, the overall head of "China Electric," who was sitting next to Zhang Junxiang, stood up in response. He was wearing casual cotton clothes, looking amiable and approachable, not at all like someone attending a formal meeting with a serious demeanor. He first asked Zhang Junxiang, "What do you want me to say?" Zhang Junxiang replied, "Say whatever you like!" Everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo spoke casually, first saying that the "China Electric" team had arrived in Shanghai in scattered groups and that the journey had been very arduous. He expressed his condolences here. In addition, he welcomed all the new colleagues to join their group. Later, he considered it again and then said, "I would like to mention my style and approach in the future here. Perhaps that's what Mr. Zhang wants me to say!"</p>
<p>"First, I have no preconceptions about things. This does not mean that I have no direction. I do have a direction. I will do as much as I can. The 'China Electric' theater troupe was created when filming movies was impossible. We used the talents of film workers to engage in spoken drama. This approach was correct at the time, but it is no longer correct now. Film and spoken drama each have their own different characteristics. The organizational system and scope of work of the theater troupe should be completely separated from the film aspect in the future, and each should develop independently.</p>
<p>"Second, regarding technical aspects, how to divide them from film does not refer to stage equipment, lighting, and other technologies, but to the technology of separating from the film department. The theater troupe used to be attached to an organization. In the future, I hope, or rather, I will strive to make it professionalized. This means that it will no longer be like a government office. In other words, it must be able to be self-sufficient. I will provide you with all the conditions to achieve self-sufficiency. I don't need to make money, but I also don't need to lose money. If the theater troupe has a surplus, it still belongs to everyone. This means that the surplus of the theater troupe should be used to develop the theater troupe and to ensure the lives of everyone. When implementing this, I will bear the responsibility of solving various problems with you all, just like you. I hope that what I do, you will all do the same. Of course, if I am not good, you can tell me.</p>
<p>"Third, I must declare my own position. I am borrowing Mr. Wan Jiabao's words, I am a 'bridge.' I am willing to be a bridge. I will take all the responsibility, but to do it well, everyone must work hard. I have plans and deployments for all aspects of 'China Electric.' Regarding the Shanghai theater troupe, I hope that Mr. Zhang will take more responsibility. In fact, Mr. Zhang has already done so.</p>
<p>"In addition, let me mention that everyone or every group has strengths and weaknesses. I hope that everyone will do their best to develop their strengths. Moreover, it is not enough for each person to develop their own strengths individually. We must turn each person's strengths into the strengths of the theater troupe in order to stand firm. Everyone has had a good performance in the past seven or eight years, and it will certainly be the same in the future. Whether you are a new colleague or an old colleague, it is the same. To be honest, our theater troupe has a lot of hope."</p>
<p>After Mr. Luo finished speaking, Zhang Junxiang stood up again. He said humorously, "Mr. Luo is very busy and wants me to take more responsibility. Mr. Luo is the 'bridge,' and I am just the M.P. at the head of the bridge, watching over everyone as they pass by in cars, jeeps, and motorcycles."</p>
<p>Zhang Junxiang first introduced several people in the "theater troupe" who needed to be recognized for work purposes. Then, the stage manager Liu Housheng introduced the rest of the people who had come to Shanghai. Yang Yingwu introduced the newly joined members. Then, they entered the stage of discussing the establishment of a living and art committee. Mr. Luo left the meeting first.</p>
<p>In a warm and free atmosphere, it was decided that the "Living Committee" would still follow the old Chongqing system with slight modifications, collectively called "China Electric Village." All members of each troupe were members of the village, enjoying all rights and contributing all obligations. The highest leader of the entire village was the chairman, with units for secretary, medical affairs, library, social affairs, sports, and music under him. Zhang Junxiang was elected to the "Sports" group, but not as the natural chairman of "China Electric Village," which shows how democratic they were. Then, the art committee was elected. In addition to the standing committee members who were actually responsible for various aspects of performance work, there were also five village representatives who jointly decided on all artistic issues. These are only the internal details of "China Electric," and I will not go into detail here. However, this new atmosphere is quite enough for the reference of the theater and film industry.</p>
<h3>Wu Yonggang and Cai Chusheng Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>The famous directors Wu Yonggang and Cai Chusheng transferred from Hong Kong to the mainland during the Anti-Japanese War and served as directors at the Central Film Studio. They have recently arrived in Shanghai one after another. Both have families in Shanghai, so after arriving in Shanghai, they each went to their own homes. It is reported that both are actively preparing for the production of new works.</p>
<h3>"Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty"</h3>
<p>— Niu Yi</p>
<p>In the mainland, Yang Cunbin's "Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" has been one of the most popular spoken dramas in recent years.</p>
<p>The first part of "Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty," "Emperor Guangxu's Personal Rule," uses the historical events of Emperor Guangxu's initial grasp of power and Empress Dowager Cixi's behind-the-scenes manipulation and autocracy as its subject matter. On the surface, it is somewhat similar in material to Yao Ke's "Qing Palace Grievances," which was performed in Shanghai, but the former narrates less about the romance between Emperor Guangxu and Consort Zhen and focuses more on expressing the political situation at the time, such as the "war" and "peace" factions regarding Japan, and the expansion of revolutionary forces. The tight and vivid structure and the skillful use of the Manchu vernacular are the highlights of the play.</p>
<p>It is said that "Hard Work" will soon stage this play, probably around the Lunar New Year after "Night Shop." The audience in Shanghai will also have the opportunity to appreciate it.</p>
<p>"Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" has many characters. Among them, the main characters such as Empress Dowager Cixi, Li Lianying, and Emperor Guangxu have been decided to be played by Danny, Shi Hui, and Zhang Fa, etc. It is said that Shen Min, who went to Chongqing, will also rush back to Shanghai before the Lunar New Year to participate in the performance. This is another piece of good news.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Skies"</h3>
<p>— Fen</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, there was a most outstanding production in the rear, which was "China Electric's" "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Skies." This film is the work of the poet-director Sun Yu, which narrates the birth, growth, and struggle history of the Chinese Air Force. It is a bloody and tragic poem. The actors include Bai Yang, Wang Renmei, Jin Yan, Wei Heling, Gu Er'yi, Shi Chao, Dan Ning, etc. The two copperplates printed here are two scenes from the film. Bai Yang, Jin Yan, and other red stars, who have been away from Shanghai for eight years, will soon be reunited with the people of this city in the city's two major theaters.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Clearing Debts Leads to Disputes, Only the Law is Considered, Not Personal Feelings</h3>
<p>Editor: I have always admired your newspaper's social service column for answering questions for readers. I have a matter to ask about, and I would be grateful if you could answer it in your newspaper. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, I borrowed 200 legal tender from a wealthy household in my hometown (in the rear, non-occupied area). At that time, in addition to writing an IOU, I also mortgaged my ancestral property title deed, paying 2% interest per year, which I paid in full every year. In May of this year, I repaid five times the amount and paid the interest up to the end of the year, asking the wealthy household to return the IOU and the mortgaged property title deed. However, the wealthy household refused to return the IOU and the mortgaged property title deed, claiming that the amount was too small. I don't know what method I can use to clear this debt. Does the government have other regulations on how to clear debts borrowed during the Anti-Japanese War, or how many times should be added? If I must clear the debt and the debtor refuses to accept it and does not return the IOU and the mortgaged property title deed, what is the proper way to resolve it? I respectfully ask your newspaper to disclose it in detail so that the debtor may also know the details. Respectfully wishing you good health! Wang Qiang, a reader from Wuxing. The currency value is low. Creditors indeed suffer losses, and therefore may request compensation for damages. The court may handle this case with discretion, but there is no special law to provide relief. Since the principal and interest have been paid off, and you have offered five times the principal, but the wealthy household is using the IOU as collateral and refuses to return it, if there are no other disputes, you can resort to the law to seek relief.

<h3>Three Questions for the Post Office: Remittance to Huaguo Mountain Sinks to the Bottom of the Sea</h3>
<p>Our newspaper reader, Mr. Hu Yingming, is requesting a public inquiry regarding the loss of a remittance, stating that he remitted 90,000 yuan in legal tender from the Shanghai Farmers Bank to Tunxi on November 19th last year. The remittance ticket was sent by registered mail at the North Fujian Road Post Office on the 20th. Three months have passed, but the return receipt for the registered mail has not been delivered. Therefore, he went to the post office to inquire and was told to write a blank envelope in the same way and send it to them so that they could investigate. However, another month has passed, and there is still no news. He has inquired at the post office once again, and was told that if there is definite news, he will be notified by letter. He thinks that he remitted the money to Hui because his family had an urgent need, and it is now approaching the end of the year, so how can he wait any longer? He has three questions that he hopes the postal authorities and the Farmers Bank will answer: [1] What responsibility should the post office bear for the loss of the registered letter? [2] When will there be definite news about the investigation? [3] If the money at the Tunxi Farmers Bank has not been fraudulently claimed, what procedure should be followed to claim it later, or how long will it take to be able to claim it? Hu Yingming, No. 16, Lane 423, Jinling East Road.</p>

<h3>Young People Want to Enter Normal School</h3>
<p>Editor: We are a group of young people who are interested in education. We are first-year high school students at a private middle school in this city and are very interested in entering normal school to study. However, we do not know which school is better. Please introduce us to one and answer publicly in the newspaper. We have always admired your column for providing social services without any effort. We believe you will not refuse our humble question. Wishing you good health, students Wu Enlai, Zhang Qi, Jin Zijian, etc. [Answer] Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School and Xinlu Normal School both have very complete content and are suitable for further study.</p>
<p>Inquiry about Jiaoji Railway Registration Office</p>
<p>Dear Sir: A friend from another port has entrusted me to inquire whether there is a Jiaoji Railway Restoration Registration Office in Shanghai, as well as a receiving agency of a similar nature. I am writing to ask you to kindly provide an answer. Sincerely, Zhang Shikuan. [Answer] I have not heard of a Jiaoji Railway Restoration Registration Office in Shanghai. Please inquire with the Lianglu Administration Bureau or write directly to the railway bureau in Jinan.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, my relative studied at Lester Institute of Technology. After completing the second year of junior high school, he wanted to enter the original school for further study, but unexpectedly it was changed to East Asia Institute of Technology by the enemy and puppets. Helplessly, he had to continue his studies until it was dissolved shortly before the recent victory. The certificates obtained by the students of that school are all in Japanese. Of course, this is a puppet school, and there is no need to doubt it. However, the students of that school are all students of the puppet school. But the school is neither a puppet national school nor a puppet municipal school. There is no way to verify the academic status of the students of that school. If they apply to other schools, they will not be accepted. I think there are quite a few students studying at that school. Now, they have neither a proper job nor a chance to go to school. Lester has not yet been restored. Given this complicated situation, I would like to ask your newspaper for instructions. Shenbao reader Jie Min.</p>
<p>[Answer] Lester Institute of Technology was known to be very complete before the war. It is a pity that the environment is like this, and the students in the school are in a dilemma. It is regrettable! Now they are wandering in a wrong direction and suffering the pain of being out of school. I hope the students will elect representatives and petition the Education Bureau. There should be arrangements for the next semester. [Editor]</p>
