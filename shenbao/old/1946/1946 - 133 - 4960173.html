<h3>克服我們的新敵人——饑饉！</h3>
<p>這幾大來，上海及各地的米價又復狂漲，滬市且已跳出五萬大關，使每一個人民都感受到糧荒的威脅，尤其是一般升斗小民，惶惶然不可終日。民以食爲天，糧食問題誠爲當前最嚴重的問題。「　節」已成爲我們的新敵人。今天無論政治，經濟，社會任何方面，如果不能解決糧食問題，其他一切就無從談起。但是怎樣克服這「　饉」敵人呢？也眞不是一個單純的問題。</p>
<p>上海目前固遭受米價騰漲的威脅，各省市也同時閙着饑荒，甚至在世界的任何一角落，都有大批嗷嗷特哺的饑民，在那裏引領等待悲天憫人的慈善家去振濟。據中國駐美大使館參事陳之邁氏最近向聯總報吿：「中國飢民已增加至三千萬人，糧食供應的情形，每况愈下，而聯總於本年第一季巡往中國的糧食，僅足够飢民一天的消費。」聯總署長賴伽第也率直表示，對於中國的　荒特別關切。他說：「余對於中國糧荒情形，認爲已慘不忍言，但望各國人士對於此種大規模之　饉及死亡，當不能漠然無動。」同時聯合國糧食農業組織報吿世界糧食情形，也說遠東及歐洲糧食生產量仍在戰前水準之下，預料明年糧荒將依舊嚴重，一九四七年未必優於今年。由此可知糧食恐慌已不是一隅一國的問題，而是整個世界的問題。世界問題就得集合全世界人類的心思才力方能解決。而中國爲世界糧荒比蛟嚴重的一國，中國人民尤當用着過去對暴日抗戰的精神與力量，聯合較有力量而又秉性慷慨的盟國。來與「饑饉」，新的敵人相搏鬥，必求克服此新敵入而後已。</p>
<p>美國救濟委員會主席即前總統胡佛，鑒於世界糧荒的嚴重，曾奉杜魯門總統之命，到歐洲及遠東去調査各國糧食供應情形，業已返國覆命，預料不久或許將有錦囊妙計發表出來。但觀於胡佛返美後發表的談話稱，「世界各地發生饑荒，其危險極大，救濟糧食若猶遲遲不到，則荒最嚴重之區的千萬人民，均將成爲餓殍」，可知他除了向美國人民呼籲請他們慷慨解　救濟飢民而外，恐怕也未必有更妥善的辦法。而即此一端，更可見抵抗　饉，除了極端節約，竭力振濟而外，也實在沒有其他的妙計。</p>
<p>中國本是農業國家，全國人口百分之八十以上都是以農爲生，照理不應該發生糧荒問題的。可是中國農業產技術還是落後，平時已感缺糧，而况抗戰最早最久，戰禍延及全國，人民遭受到的損失，幾乎無法用數字來統計。這幾年來，在淪陷區的農村，受盡敵僞的摧殘，呈現出支離破碎的慘象；在自由區的農村，不但供給廣大的人力以保衛祖國，而且貢獻了無數的財力物力，支持國家的戰時財政及軍糧，因此也呈現出田園荒蕪的凄凉現象。抗戰八年的結果，固然贏得了勝利，但是挽救不了農村的破產，或反而加速了農村的破產。三千萬的戰爭難民，無家可歸，流落異鄕，衣不暖，食不飽、淪爲可憐無吿的饑民，如不能設法救濟，可能一槪淪爲餓殍。聯合國在戰爭行將結束之際，早已料及戰後世界的困苦，必須設法救濟，故有聯總之組織，而中國情形更爲嚴重，乃在行政院添設行總，協助聯總辦理救濟事宜。但自成立以來，其成績殊難令人滿意，殆亦為不可諱言之事實。即在聯署長賴伽第本人，為聯總的前途擔憂，他曾坦白表示：「以目下情況而論，存糧既不充足，聯總且無法獲悉下一個月究能獲得幾許糧食，此種局勢如果繼續延長，則聯總亦將有崩潰之虞。」聯總如此，行總更不必說。聽說行總某省分署運員工薪給尙且拖欠，還那裏有精神來解救糧荒？</p>
<p>我國糧荒的情形旣如此嚴重，而聯總的救濟，終不免有「遠水救不得近火」之感，吾人唯有先致全力於「自力更生」之途，然後再促起盟國的共同注意，合力以消除中國糧荒的成脅。我們以爲目前最急之務，不外下列數端：</p>
<p>第一，在消極方而，應該提倡極端節的，實行計口授糧，把節省下來的物資，救濟奄奄待斃的同胞。以一般工農與公教人員的生活情形而論，固已節無可節，省無可省，大半在饑餓綫上掙扎，似乎談不到節約問題。似是我們耳聞也有少數工人竟以增加的工資，漫作無謂的浪費。何况抗戰以來，發國難財的人們，昭昭在人耳目。他們對於這三千萬的同胞，不論在道義上或在實力上，此時都應該慷慨救濟。可是放眼一看，那些發財的奸蠹，都只知個人的享受揮霍，窮奢極侈，漫無止境，從未想及國內還有三千萬待斃的饑民。尤其在紙醉金迷的上海，到處可以見到他們過着腐敗　淫的糜爛生活，政府不禁，社會不怪，幾令人不能相信中國正鬧着饑荒！這種「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨」的情形，我們決不能任共再有一天的存在。外國新聞記者平已感歎「中國饑餓，上海跳舞」了，國府首都最近也已明令禁止跳舞了，而上海這個腐敗淫逸的社會還是酒食徵逐，歌舞昇平，究竟從那裏說起！最近艾森豪威爾元帥來華，說過一句話，「美國願意帮助能够自助的人」，這眞値得我們警惕反省。我們政府應該當機立斷，禁止一切浪費糜爛的生活行爲，開始實行計口授糧的節約政策。聽說這幾天某家電話買米幾百石，某戶買米幾十擔，這種無意識的囤購糧食，以及米商的居奇不售，都該從嚴懲處。一切酒樓飯館，尤應嚴訂規則，禁止晏游無度的糧食消費。在消耗方面，祇有全國厲行節約，束緊褲帶，纔能克服當前「饑饉」的新敵！</p>
<p>第二，在積極方而，我們一方面應該努力增加農業生產，一方面應該交涉購運洋米來華。我們相信：全國朝野若能稍盡人事，我國糧食生產當可改進增加。總理民生主義對於改進我國農業所提出的兩種辦法，一是「耕者有其田」，二是「農業機械化」，都是當前最迫切而應實施的措置。不過實施這兩個政策，先需要有一個優良的環境，就是和平安定的空氣與淸明廉能的地方政治，使一般農民得以安事稼檣。否則不論理想如何高明，辦法如何切實，要增加農業生產還是不可能的。所以我們要求政府與共黨切實履行「軍隊國家化，政治民主化」。換言之，共黨立即放棄挑釁破壞的政策，政府立即恢復交通，整編軍隊。否則不僅無法增加農業生產，而且還要增加人爲饑荒的嚴重性，以至後患無窮。如果我們能够自己節約，並且恢復國內的和平與安定，則我們就有充分的權利，要求有餘糧的盟國除了運糧振濟中國災荒而外，更准許中國得自暹羅安南等產米區域大量購米運華，使我國米價降低，維持一般的民食。</p>
<p>最後，還有一點，値得提供硏究，就是採用科學的方法，硏究出每人最低限度的糧食消費量，規定必須人人遵守，這不但可以節省糧食，面且還能保持人民的健康。戰時的英國，因爲食物輸入减少，必須實行計口授糧的辦法，會由營義專家設計一個良好的辦法，至勝利之後仍照樣實行，並將再維持五年之久。英國是一個富强之國，尙且如此，而中國旣患貧窮，又苦糧荒，豈容社會上再有「不均」的現象存在？人人只消費最低限度的糧食，就是克服　饉的最好辦法！</p>

<h3>貝文返敦請訓　義國賠款問四國仍未獲協議　傳美同意薩爾區併法</h3>

<p>〔合眾社巴黎十二日電〕今日四國外長又舉行秘密會議一次，歷時二小時牛，以謀打開賠償問題之僵局，蘇外長莫洛托夫表示，如四强對於義國和約問題能獲協議，則彼願意規定二十一國和會之日期，不必等待巴爾幹各國和約問題之完全解決。四國外長在今日之會議亦曾就巴爾幹及芬蘭和約問題進行簡短之討論，會議雖未產生新結果，但莫洛托夫首次賠示此等和約係屬次要問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎中一日電〕四國外長會議本日賡續開會，因各國代表均等候各該國政府之訓令，故獲有進展。本日會議又曾講論義大利賠款問題，亦未成立協議。貝爾謂期曾經發言，贊成蘇聯要求由義國以一萬萬芙元賠與該國，但須以下列各項物品折合之：即（一）義大利在海外之資　，（二）　　　　，（三）商船兩　，（四）義大利軍艦四艘。此外並就戰利品一詞，加以解譯，凡為一國所奪獲者中可稱為戰利品，凡議與蘇聯之船隻，祇可視為補補　，不能認為戰利品，因此又與莫洛托夫發生爭議。</p>
<p>（又電）此間頃接獲美國方面消息：華盛頓當局已決定對於德國　爾區併人法國一項建議，表示同意，但尙未正式通知法國政府。一般相信當德國薩爾問題提付討論時，法國將建議與對德國和約一併解決。</p>

<p>〔路透社開羅十二日電〕阿刺伯聯盟秘書長阿柴姆昨發表談話稱；若以的黎波里交與義大利托管，吾人不惜一戰，吾人與義人作戰幾二十年，決不尤其重返。英人支持義大利，吾人亦當與英人戰，且割的黎波波里與西倫奈加，足以推殘當地經濟，吾人決不容許之。阿刺伯之國家，在實力尙未充沛時，固不妨由聯合國托管，但吾人次不允許由義人托管云</p>

<h3>史達林收到的信最多？　杜魯門收到的還要多？　地球四面八方的人　都向美總統求援　訴苦·惜錢·形形色色樣樣都有</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕據說史達林元帥收到的來信，較全世界任何要人來得多，這個消息傳到國務院官員的耳朶裏，使他們有些不服。他們說杜魯門總統收到的信最多。</p>
<p>每天，從地球的四面八方，寄來可憐的信，這些信都由第二次世界大戰後發生的飢饉與窮困而來，每封信開頭差不多都是：「親愛的總統先生……」</p>
<p>「我自己不要請求」，一位希臘母親寫道：「但做我的小女兒生肺病，奄奄一息，她需要美好清潔的食物和新鮮的牛乳，才有活命的機會……」</p>
<p>又一封寄自五十六個孤兒的信，這些孤兒以前在義大利戰區亞培河岸有一所大屋子可住，他們的信上開頸是：「光榮的總統先生：炸彈摧毀了我們的住家，　　現在招顧我們。但是我們僅有一套緊身衣，夜間床上需要遮蓋的東西，白天也需要多一些食物……」</p>
<p>還有一封信要求杜魯門總統得獎美國軍官兩員，這兩軍官在義大利半島出征時，曾一度小駐，與各孤兒一同玩要，並送給孤獨們軍中的配給品和軍用毯三條。</p>
<p>美國國務院官員估計國外來信，每日約兩百封，惟今年有一個月，收信總數達一尤一千封</p>
<p>每天早上，國務院大批議員收集他們特種語言的郵件，從事翻譯工作，並作適當的答復。</p>
<p>「親愛的杜魯門叔叔」，一個六歲的匈牙利女孩寫這：「我病得厲害，我的兩耳發炎，已經六個禮拜了，我的頭受創得很重。許多小孩子在美國都有親戚，得到禮物，我確沒有親戚，只有你—親愛的杜魯門叔叔，請你也給我一些禮物，我將快活得……」</p>
<p>杜魯門夫人也接到不少的信。</p>
<p>一個荷蘭父親寫道：「直到現在，我們還沒有領到一張皮鞋配給票」，他不知怎樣可以替他的「奧爾茄和洛斯恭」兩小女孩得到「走路的皮鞋」。他附送孩子的照片一幀，並寫道：「我們覺得收受這些東西為禮物，有些不快，我們仲無法向外國付款，但你可不可以做他倆的「姑母」，送給一些鞋子，等將來償還你呢？」</p>
<p>還有些信，至少因為與歐洲一洋之隔，從此間看起來似乎怪有趣味地。</p>
<p>另有些信寄自一羣小姑娘，要求派一批好萊塢電影小生到他們城中，「演講，並告訴我們好萊塢的生活」。</p>
<p>還有要求借錢的，要求科學校設備的，更有要求入美國國籍的，也有些單是要求杜魯門對解放他們的美國人致謝，這些信都視其內容由政府關係識關答復。</p>

<h3>挽救工業危機　籌開生產會議　工資增高舶來品充斥巿上　搪瓷皮革業亦將全趨破產</h3>
<p>本巿工業界面臨危機，各工廠要求裁員减工者，績有發生。其中尤以紡織蠶絲工衣為更甚，近曾由同業公會提請社會局准予裁减員工。社會局吳開先局長為此特呈請巿政府，從速召開生產擴大會議，俾促進生產，搶救失業。該項提案，業經巿府巿政會議通過，着即籌備。茲悉參加者將有行政院駐滬各機關，資源委員會，中紡及中蠶公司，銀行公會，商會，工會，農會等代表云。</p>
<p>據搪瓷廠商談，搪瓷業在淪陷時期，主要原料（鐵皮）遭各偽以徵募廢鐵名義為由徵收後，全部搪瓷工業，被陷於停頓。因此破產者，不知凡幾，損失相當鉅大。勝利後，滿擬即行復工，然因國內政治未臻安定，交通阻塞，原料來源未暢，各廠資力薄弱，加以工潮澎湃，無或寗日，因此搪瓷業仍無生產可言。溯處外匯開放後，外貨源源而來，國產搪瓷，更受嚴重打擊。長此以往，搪瓷工業，勢必全趨破產，外銷巿塲，定無插足之地，因此盼政府當局，能予以扶植，以挽救搪瓷業於絕路云。</p>
<p>頃據本巿皮革業鉅子談：該業自勝利後，至今年正月份止，其時因巿價較廉，故營業殊盛。然大部份均係盟邦人士購買，故至今年三月一日起，全體工人要求加薪。工潮解決後，物價迭漲，工資增高，成本加重，盟邦人士亦紛紛被調回國，購買力漸弱，營業一落千丈。蚌埠·溫州·南京各地運來之皮件，其價僅等於上海之工價，故各商均樂運來滬出售，且有更多向南美洲，阿根廷，烏拉圭等地定貨，因其成本低廉。本年秋節，如運輸轉好，巿面將全部為外國貨應巿，而本巿之皮革工人，因無工可作，將全部失業。此外戰前本巿皮鞋等，多有運銷南洋，目前亦因成本過高，無法運往，該同業等現正積極組織公會，將集中力量，以應付來日之危機。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕引水員關係輪船到埠，進出港口時引領航道，非常重要，即長江船隻，亦須引水員駕駛。本巿現有二區，計：一，淞滬區，外洋船隻來滬，至　銅沙須待引水員登輪駕駛入港，出口亦須引領至吳淞口外。二，淞漢區，即上海漢口之長江綫，各輪除船長外，必須聘熟悉長江水道者引水，故該項引水人員，關係船舶行駛至鉅，其技術亦不亞於船長。在我國航權未收回前，淞滬區領港（即引水）權，亦遭外人所奪。自抗戰勝利後，各國放棄航權，引水權亦隨之收回。本巿引水員約計三百餘人，其中浙籍最多，鄂籍次之，粵籍最少。交通部為重視引管理委員會，各埠設辦事處，以便就近管理。本巿淞漢區引水辦事處，在外灘A九號，附設淞滬區引水辦事處。淞漢區主任秦鑄如，業已到差辦公。引水員組織淞漢區引水公會，亦已成立，主席馮遷珍，總務股主任王明光，副主任王安德，業務股主任能章福，副主任張春發。各公司所聘常任引水，已超過半數以上，因之臨時引水人員，大感缺乏，該會正加以調整中。</p>

<h3>中國區聯總署長　基撒突然辭職　原因為反對改變中國區聯總任務</h3>
<p>聯合國善後救濟總署署長拉瓜第亞私人代表洛克斯將軍昨日宣佈稱：「聯總」中國區署署長基撒，現已辭去本職。渠辭職之原因，為反對改變中國區署任務之議。又訊：聯總中國區署署長辭職，發表聲明如次：「聯合國善後救濟署長拉瓜第亞私人代表洛克斯將軍，已與余（中國區署署長基撒氏自稱）完成最近舉行之會商，洛克斯將軍鑒於目前情勢之變更，認為中國區署之政策及工作程序亦應隨之變更，故與余進行此次會商。余因不同意洛氏改變政策及工作程序之建議，故已呈請辭職。總署署長現已任命雷易氏於繼任人選決定前暫代余之職務。總署署長同時請余於兩三個月之短期內，繼續在中國區署工作，充任顧問，以期本分署各部門工作得以順利推　。余對總署中國計劃極感興趣，故已表示同意，余之即速返美之私人願　，　亦暫時作　。吾人前曾考慮本區署組主任奧姆斯特上校調任行政院善後救濟總署之問題，因　之才　及經騐，可在「行總」方面，充分發揮。同時此種更動，原係出諸行總爵李兩氏，且經宋院長同意，奧姆斯特一校現已調任「行總」職務。渠將與行總工作組主任劉鴻生合作，助彼完成建築鐵路，航路及公路之艱巨工作，並加速推展中國政府善後救濟之計劃」。</p>

<h3>勞資間糾紛未已　西服店續被搗毀　警備部勸告雙方勿得越軌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本巿西服業勞資糾紛事，勞方以資方遷延談判，乃激起一部份職工憤慨，連日分赴街頭張貼標語，與資方引起衝突，致日前有一部份店號被搗毀。受害者有南京路培羅蒙·裕昌祥·皇家·王榮康；大新街泰興·新華；林森西路天祥·星星·景星等數家。其中尤以培羅蒙損害最重，顧客定製之新裝，被澆洒墨汁，不易洗滌，損失逾千萬元。面星星於衝突時，並有四人受傷。當時肇事職工，曾由各區警察分局捕去十數名。</p>
<p>昨晨職工會為防止事態益趨擴大，曾派代表趨訪同業公會洽商，但未有結果。而南京路裕昌祥，成者路吳興昌·永興·等數家，又以被搗毀聞。事後　局派員到塲彈壓，但肇事職工早已逸去</p>
<p>警局派員　到塲彈壓</p>
<p>追溯此次事件，職工底薪已得治商解決，癥絡所在，僅為米貼問題。全商談遷延至今，乃造成如此局面，今工會方面表示，決盡力防止發生衝突，不使風潮擴大，並謀解決途徑云。同時淞滬　　總司令部，以此次職工行動，不無越規，一再肇事，影響社會秩序匪淺。並為防止事態擴大計，向雙方勸告，商定：（一）被捕工人由警備部交涉釋放；（二）雙方繼續談判，規定最後時期，以十四日下午六點鐘為止；（三）談判期中，工人不得再有越規事件發生。故事件結局，須視今明兩日之談判而決定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕英　電　公司勞資糾紛事件，將於今晨九時半在社會局繼續　談。其於十一日雙方談判中國得解決者，僅為病假　退職　兩問題。病假辦法為住院者工資照發，醫藥費由公司負担，但以六星期為限。逾此期限，得醫生證明後，仍可繼續。至　病不住院者，工資照發，但公司不負償付醫藥費責任。關於因公受傷者，則參照電力公司成議辦理。退職金辦法須服務滿十五年以上者，始得享受。</p>
<p>今日商議者將為增加底薪，及二百餘失業工人復工問題。其中尤以後者雙方意見最難接近。因工人堅持第一批必須光復工一百人，但公司認為目前　需如此之多，僅尤以後每加車一輛，復工六人，此僵局猶待緊日解決。</p>
<p>關於職工要費用自民國三十年起，補發賞金一節，據社會局某負責人稱：此點於法無據，且有類　相增加底薪，故擬不接受此項請求云。</p>
<h3>今年母親節　無歡樂可言　紀念會中　全堂淚下</h3>

<h3>蒐集戰地敵人罪行　希望民眾踴躍檢舉　罪證調查小組　昨邀本巿有關機關　舉行聯席會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕軍　委員會　行政院合組之戰犯罪證調查小組，由組長柴子尚將軍率領，一行五人，於十日晚抵滬後，前日起，即開始工作，分訪本巿軍事法庭，戰犯拘留所，港口司令部，警備總司令部，巿政府，地方法院等，並於昨日上午在警備總部，遷集有關機關，舉行聯席會議，商討調查進行事項。計到三方面軍軍事法庭庭長劉世芳，軍法官林我朋，上海港口運輸司令謝灝齡將軍，及龍佐良將軍，淞滬警備總司令部譚參謀長煜麟，參謀處長吳漢超，京滬偉戌司令部上海指揮所主任宋思一，戰犯拘留所江所長公亮，地方法院黃首席檢察官亮，巿政府秘書楊卓膺，戰俘虜　處軍法官蔣主任文鶴，警察局祝科長宗海，憲穡二十三團王延鋆，及調查小組馬志振，鄧良士，唐表民，楊覺勇及逮東國際法庭檢察官克勞漢等。</p>
<p>商討進行事項　提出各項詢問</p>
<p>首由馬志振報告我國處理戰犯程序，繼由各機關代表報告各機關處理戰犯情形後，劉世芳氏提出質詢謂：軍事法庭處理戰犯約有下列困難：（一）量刑之標準，中央未予明定，判決時不無困難，（二）軍事法庭人員僅二十餘，而審理案件太多，感人力不够，（二）各方所送戰犯名單所列罪行事實太簡，不足為起訴之根據，並謂全國各地處理戰犯辦法不統一，建議召開全國性之處理戰犯會議，以求統一辦法。後由軍政部唐軍法官表民，分別答復：並謂依處理戰犯程序，須中央審核列入戰犯名單者，始可逮捕，惟依戰犯處理辦法第四條之規定，地區軍事當局根據人民控訴，經查實者可用緊急逮捕權，予以逮捕。後由各機關代表向遠東國際法庭代表克勞萊提出各項詢問，並發表向中央建議事項，請調查小組代為轉達，至下午一時始散會。該組定今日晨飛漢口調查戰罪，並將飛赴福州，台灣，廣州，桂林，衡陽，長沙，南昌，鄭州，北平，天津，徐州，南京等處，審訊日本主要戰犯二十八名時，治以應得之罪。</p>
<p>出發各區調查　預期僅為一月</p>
<p>該組為使各界明瞭其工作，任務，特於昨午二時假八仙橋青年會，茶會招待本巿新聞界，席間由組員外交部代表楊專員覺勇報告，　謂：最近遣送日俘日僑工作，即將完成，而戰犯逮捕及審訊工作，尚未能滿意，今後實有加强之必要。同時，盟軍總部因我國抗戰八年，時間最久，人民所遭受之痛苦亦最深，爰於三月底派國際法庭檢察官三人及秘書一人，協助我國從事組織戰犯罪證調查小組，於四月九日成立。本組任務為督導各地處理戰犯，指示搜集罪證方針，以及實地採訪各戰塲敵人之暴行事實，惟預定日期僅一個月，工作方面，或不能達到理想之美滿，故深望與論界多予協助，喚起民眾注意，儘量檢舉。</p>
<p>與我有關戰犯　有權要求引渡</p>
<p>嗣由司法行政部代表馬專員志振報告：本巿地方法院審理敵人暴行登記案件，自去年十一月至本年四月止，共計三萬〇六百餘件，全國總數約在十四萬餘件，惟檢舉人大部均未能指出戰犯姓名，致調查困難。本巿第一綏靖區司令部軍事法院，亦因此而未能順利偵訊。末由軍政部代表唐法官表民，軍令部代表鄧參謀良士，相繼報告，並解答各記者之提問。最後外交部代表楊專員補充各點：（一）處置戰犯，係根據國際公法戰爭法規定，並非報復性質，故一切均以事實為前提，（二）凡與我國直接有關之戰犯，不論在何地，均有權要求引渡，（三）處理戰犯程序，最初為調查，然後為提名檢舉，經審查確定，除由外交部譯文分送倫敦戰罪總會，遠東分會備案外，並即由軍委會下令逮捕，予以起訴審訊，至四時半始散。</p>

<h3>蘇北「解放區」　盼政府設法救濟　居民流離失所紛紛逃出</h3>
<p>江北旅滬同鄭服務社負責人昨語記者糖：自抗戰勝利後，蘇北「解放區」，尚有二千萬生　，陷於黑暗地獄中，無日不在生死　緣上掙扎，目前正有成千成萬之男女難民，向揚泰公路及京滬綫集中流　，扶老携幼，厥狀至慘。據可靠調查　集上海巿之江北難民，現已有三萬餘人，就中以鑒城·阜寧·東台·興化一帶者為最多，渠等家鄉，現正推行「三光」政策，即「壯丁抽光」，「食糧搶光」，「知識份子殺光」，無一不在虎口之下，茲將實際情况略為一述：</p>
<p>解放情形</p>
<p>自二十九年秋間，共達攻陷黃橋後，即開始侵入蘇北地區，假抗戰之名，搜刮糧食，擴充地盤，并在各地　委縣長，强拉「民兵」。日本投降後，共黨軍隊「新四軍」，乃軍械「　政」黨城，繳獲敵人大批武器，正式稱為「解放」區。第一步即實行「清鄉」政策，搜索漢　及所謂「國特」份子。凡稍有資本，知識及資望之老百姓，均　任意誣蔑，　行嚴　，或沒收其財產，以充軍　，更利誘地痞流氓，組織「民兵基幹部隊」，號為「參軍」，勒令其他老百姓　田，慰勞「參軍」家屬。此外，并組織「農坑會」，實行「二五减租」及「婦女會」，實行「獻身運動」。彼等所實行之二五减租，須自民國二十六年起計算，强迫地主倒繳租糧，無力繳納者，祇有賣田售產，勉强應付。幣制方面，「新四軍」已在蘇北設立「淮南銀行」，濫發「抗幣」，「抗幣」分「新抗」「老抗」幣値極為紊亂，且通行地區亦有限制，老百姓均無法辨別，苦痛不堪。</p>
<p>青年流亡</p>
<p>解放區內，青年男女不但無言論·思想出版·集會·結社等自由·即居住·行動·亦失去自由，以前傾向馬克思主義之青年，現均幡然覺悟，拆穿西洋　，不得不向京滬鎭揚一帶逃難。渠等旣無旅費，亦無熱伴，沿途殊為狼狽，現京　一帶幾集中二十萬人，飽常失業失學痛苦，例如本學期缺江中學招考新生一百名，竟有一千八百八餘名投考，其失學青年之多，於此可見，最近蘇北又在大抽壯丁，每戶銀抽八名，預料將更有大批青年，出外逃難。</p>
<p>希望諒解</p>
<p>蘇北在倭寇未投降前，整個人民在倭寇鐵蹄下，茍延殘喘，已受盡人間地獄之苦，倭寇旣投降後，又被共黨乘虛侵入，攻城掠地，任意蹂躪，眞有哭笑不得之感，一般老百姓均以為：（一）共產黨旣自稱為政黨，就應黨愛護人民，不應以政爭，而玩弄老百姓，更不應以「恐怖政策」，實行共產主義。（二）蘇北與首都，近在咫尺，江南江北，即有天堂地獄之別，政府何忍，置此十萬老百姓於不顧，共黨領袖又何竟充耳不聞，任其部下如此暴行。眼前唯一期望，即國共雙方取得諒解，由政府早派國軍前往蘇北接收，以解倒懸。同時並盼善後救濟總署迅撥大批救濟特資，運　蘇北，俾使一般老百姓得以重圖生聚。</p>

<h3>營業牌照稅漫談</h3>
<p>— 諸尚一</p>
<p>滬市財政困難，乃有開徵營業牌照稅之舉，營業牌照稅，為取締稅之一種。即凡應予取締之營業，菲經納稅，　得許可，不能擅自開業。</p>
<p>分折稅法列舉之各項應納牌照稅之營業，都凡二煩：</p>
<p>一·屬於奢侈品類者。</p>
<p>二·屬於無謂消耗若迷信品類者，</p>
<p>其有未親列入，而應予取締者，則繼財政部之核准，亦得徵收營業牌照稅。</p>
<p>但所謂應予取締者，實亦有其明確之限界；故財部之核准取締，亦必以「應予取締」為先決條件。否則與取締稅之原意不符，而顯似商業登記之手續費矣。</p>
<p>查滬市開徵之營業牌照稅，原定三十三種，復經財政部核准增加五種，都凡三十八種。其中是否悉屬「應予取締」，在理論上實滋疑問。例如西藥可取締，則醫學院，醫學化驗所之屬，根本便有問題，理髮業可取締，則國藥舖殆可停止生髮之藥料發賣，至於呢絨，西裝兩業被取締，其理由何在，更難索解，而照相業之被認為奢侈或無謂　　，不解國民身份證何故尚須貼用照片？</p>
<p>夫命令不得變更法律，為法治國，不可或違之原則。故以不應取締之營業而特課徵，無論是否呈經核准，其為不盡合法，即使「因地制宜之稅捐，原則上准予徵收」亦「應由各地方政府提經民意機關通過後呈請中央核准施行」方為合法！讀行政院節安丁字三七八三號訓令，謂：「現時自治財政困難之最大原因，在支出無度，中央委辦事項過多，以及軍事方面之徵用徵　，負担過鉅，以致法定收入，無法應付。」是知自治財政之困難，自有其癥結所在。今不從根本上迅籌解決，而徒枝枝節節，於娛樂稅，筵席　之外，更從營業牌照上廣求挹注，竊恐牧效無多，而於稅制之整理上，將治絲而愈棼矣。</p>

<h3>橋恢復教育飛行前夕　訪青空的鬥士</h3>
<p>— 杭州十一日通訊　朱民成</p>
<p>杭州筧橋中國航空軍官學校的官生兵，正在以各種交通工具自昆明東返。　橋航校畢業生，在過去八年空戰中建下了不朽的史蹟。民國二十六年秋該校即西遷，終於在昆明巫家壩村落中設校繼續訓練學生，在最後三年，因國內補給飛機汽油不易，爲求訓練方便，得英美協助，在印度臘河設立分校，從事航空學生初級飛行訓練，初級飛行訓練期滿，即送往美國受中高級飛行訓練。</p>
<p>絲蒂曼飛機　長途飛來六十架</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，航空軍官學校即奉命由昆明及印度臘河兩處遷返杭州筧橋原址，日前記者特前往訪問筧橋航校，見航校正在由空穀中重建，工匠忙碌不停，飛機滿列綠色草地機塲上，在敎官宿實，記者尋到當年於四川梁山相衆的毛昭品敎官。他原是空軍第三大隊分隊長，作戰豫鄂湘上空，曾獲甚多戰績，後以受傷改服航校敎官職務，曹主任敎官朝覺他這次由印度臘河駕絲蒂曼（Stearman）飛機，經喜馬拉雅山駝峯野人山等地，到昆明轉來杭州。這種長途飛行，可以說是一段航空敎育史上冒險艱難的佳例，參加是役飛機有六十架，茲記航校這次飛機集體由國外返國經過，以留史蹟。</p>
<p>絲蒂曼（Stearman）飛機是美國出品，美國用以作訓練飛行員的初級敎練機，雙翼雙座，馬力小，每小時速度八十五英里，油量可飛三小時半。裝滿了油可飛三百英里航程，上昇限度一萬二千英尺。中國航校戰前及戰後五年間均用弗力提初級敎練機。民國三十二年航校於印度臘河實施航空敎育，方始採用絲蒂曼飛幾作敎練機。</p>
<p>三年以來，使用結果，絲蒂曼飛機尙完整而可以飛行者，祇剩一九十多架。這九十多架飛機亦已各飛行七百小時以上，有的飛機發動機且近翻修之時（發動機可用二千小時，屆滿必需翻修）。在抗戰勝利以後，航校奉命遷返杭州筧橋原址，在新的敎練機未由美運到以前，這一批半舊的敎練機必需要運至杭州作一施敎之用。因此，航校當局決定由印度西北部臘河，把飛機由敎官駕返國內。</p>
<p>試航歷驚險　高度二萬五千尺</p>
<p>由印度到中國的航綫，是世界上有名的艱難空程，最壞的一段是喜馬拉雅山駝峯以至緬北滇西野人山，這些山的高度都在一萬五千尺以上。這些山巔之間的航空站亦甚少，在駝峯那邊的汀江飛出以後，僅可落密支那，入莫，（均在緬北）如果找不到這二個機塲，那只有跳傘或撞山二途。因爲油量有限，別無飛還機會。</p>
<p>航校爲了要使得航空學生返國後以及在國內所招學生得以有飛機學飛起見，決定要把全部可以飛行的飛機，由航校敎官駕飛杭州。敎官們都是身經百戰的老飛行員，以技術見稱的人是不肯推諉使用技術的機會，雖然這次需要的實在不是單純的飛行技術，而且連敎官獻身的勇氣與決心也要供奉於這次冒險航行。這些一年靑的老飛行員毫不猶豫，雖然駝峯與野人山七百架失事飛機殘骸與中美人員的骨骼在腦中作怪，他們證：『決定了就實行，我們各碰運氣。」</p>
<p>第一次試航　曹朝覺自述經驗</p>
<p>去年十一月十二日，曹朝覺帶了機械軍士呂康西，駕一架絲蒂曼，郭壽松與朱若彭二人駕了另一架，兩架由印度臘河機塲起飛，開始這一航程，冒險試航，曹朝覺說道：</p>
<p>「我們這次飛行全是碰運氣，因爲前途站情况不淸楚，途中天氣，沒有預報。」</p>
<p>我們在一間滿褸風雨的房間里談這一段驚險資料，宛如置身於這種飛行中。</p>
<p>「離臘河以後，途中第一站是恩伯那（Ambala）第二站是德里，（Delhi）第三站是阿格拉，（Agra）第四站是康下。（Cawopore）。到康下以後，同行的郭壽松那架飛機發生毛病，停留修理，從此我就一架飛機單獨的向前航行。第五站阿拉哈巴，（Alahabah第六站是格雅，（Caya）第七站是伯格蒲，（Bhagapur）在伯格蒲機塲落下，發覺根本沒有人管理，也沒有油可加，看風是吹向下一站拉黑（Lalmlner）的順風，於是在附近一個印度醫生家，吃了一頓飯之後，就起機東飛。幸虧是順風，飛到拉黑油尙未用究，吾則一定要油盡迫降在野外。拉黑機塲美軍已撤退，加油後續飛，到第九站台斯堡（Tezpur）時，已晚間九點。印度天氣，晚九點如同我國黃昏時分，仍可飛行也。台斯堡是美軍基地，晚宿于此，至此飛行已二日矣。</p>
<p>「十一月十四日起飛至汀江附近加不（Chabua），聽說十五日密支那機塲美軍將撤退，雖然已是下午二點，仍決定飛越駝峯到野人山麓的密支那，以免廷至次日　密支那飛機加不到油。幸虧這段航行，未遇惡劣天氣，抵達密支那機塲上空，看見下面烟火幾處，知道美軍正在焚燒作戰後剩餘物資，落地後沒有人理我。美國官兵匆匆忙忙的準備明天回家去。別人事他們也懶得管，我飛了一天，已是飛行第三天。食宿均不能解決，只好餓了肚子在辦公室空桌上睡一夜。</p>
<p>「十六日加飛機油，遍覓不得，找了一個汽車司機，由地爲我找了一桶汽車油，絲蒂曼飛機馬力小，汽車油一樣可以使用，由密支那起飛後在途中看見一架英國飛機因損壞迫落在野地，用白布搖擺，要我通知下站來救。我抵入莫機塲，即吿知站上人去救援英機，可是，我的飛機尾輪損壞了，走路到七英里以外的美軍汽車庫房，交涉一陣，他們派人來修尾輪，修好，我即起飛。</p>
<p>「雖然是十一月，但在八莫却很熱。我往返奔走更覺悶熱。起飛時僅穿黃卡嘰襯衣一件，原擬在雲南保山機塲降落，至保山機塲盤旋二週，見下面沒有人，就一逕飛雲南驛，由保山至雲南驛爬昇于雲南高原。天氣寒冷，凍得我直打抖。落雲南驛機塲後，站長是我的同學，用絲棉被條把我蓋住睡着，時間是下午四點，眞是又冷又餓。當晚得一頓好食物，一夕安眠，十七日一早即落于比明巫家壩本校機塲。由印至昆，全程計二千四百英里，五天功夫一站一站飛了過來。到昆明機塲，美軍及英軍都很奇怪：怎麽一架中國從未見過的黃色小蚱蜢由天外飛來？紛來詢問由那里到此？吿以經印度駝峯山脚下到此，英美軍官都咋舌，翹大姆指，認爲我們將性命開玩笑。若是美國，寧願以船車裝運飛機，也不肯如此冒險飛行。」</p>
<p>我自然關心康下修理的一　絲蒂曼，正好朱若彭班長來到，他笑着說：</p>
<p>「曹主任敎官把機械士帶走了，弄得我們二個人在康卜自己修好飛機後也就急急忙忙一站一站趕過來，總算也安全到達昆明。」</p>
<p>曹朝覺與朱若彭都是廣東人，八年前，二個人都在部隊上駕戰鬥機在南京句容作戰，他們二架飛機試航成功以後，決定了大編隊絲蒂曼飛機回國的東航。</p>
<h3>大編隊東飛　由印度安抵昆明</h3>
<p>曹朝覺到了昆明一星期，印度臘河仍舊流傳着：「曹主任敎官失踪了。」以爲　朝覺與他的小蚱蜢業已在駝峯或野人山毀滅，電信交通阻礙的結果，就是流言的根源。當曹朝覺隨劉牧羣敎育長飛返臘河以後，絲蒂曼能以橫渡駝峯的成功帶給了全體駕駛員以信心。大編隊東飛的行動，立刻開始。第一批由陶科長偉生率領，一共十二架絲蒂曼飛機，去年十二月十一日由印度臘河起飛，十七日安全到達昆明。隨後于今年由昆明起飛，經羅平，百色·柳州，桂林，衡陽，漢口，安慶，南京，到杭州。這條昆杭路綫計長一千六百英里，三天可以到達。陶偉生科長十二架絲蒂曼飛機于途中雖歷經險境，但依賴其駕駛技術及領隊能力，終于安全完整的降落于杭州筧橋機塲。</p>
<p>接着，第二批絲蒂曼飛機由賴森泉，領隊由印度飛回來，機數也是十二架，第三批由鄒煥章領隊，機數十二架，第四批由周定一領隊機十二架，第五批由曹朝覺領隊，機數十架，總數六十架，均絡繹安抵國內，到達國內第一終點昆明。惟由昆至杭途中，反而略有損折。敎官王　若在羅平，因氣候關係撞山毀滅。記者曾于五月七日代表航委會政治部簡樸主任往筧橋訪）慰這批長征返國的飛行敎官。首先我在敎官宿舍看到毛昭品敎官的未婚妻水景燕小姐。水小妣可以說是一位航空迷，她樂于介紹她所熱悉的敎官們和記者談談。於是我認識了李競冲敎官夫婦，我們不像官場上相見那麽各套，大家就直率的談起來。不久，毛昭品由杭州回來，他爲我介紹試航第一架絲蒂曼飛機回國的曹朝覺主任敎官。曹主任是廣東人笑吟吟地爲我講他第一次飛回國的經過。他身體矮壯，門牙缺落，航校畢業後已飛行十五年，所授航空學生無數，這些半生花費在航空裏　　　，可說是眞正的國家人，這些人及年靑的人不像一般社會謀求高價的專家經營于私利，你看他膚色黑里帶紅潤，可知他與太陽風雨以及廣漢機塲爲友作伴的親切。不久，于耀庭敎官夾了，他是江蘇江陰人，在第一大隊第二中隊飛B—25，轟炸機，作戰于梁山，芷江等地。在日軍由桂柳向武漢撤退途中，他曾經常由芷江起飛，俯冲炸射日軍。于敎官身材高，大轟炸機飛行員常是這種身材，與駕駛艙座有關。江漢蔭敎官則爲第五大隊虎將，他還談談一段他迫降湖南沅江東興垸故事，又談他最後一役出擊衡陽敵機塲，集體擊落敵機十七架故事。最後，記者還看到朱若彭班長，他是第二架單機試航回國的絲蒂曼機駕駛員。廣東人，高身材，我臨走時還與姚全黎敎官會見了。七年未見，他頭髮已禿頂，人還是那麼精神旺盛。六十架絲蒂曼飛機駕駛員名單，我僅知道一部份，是侯臣·劉慕虞·黃煒燃。江漢蔭·姚全黎·鄒煥章·楊德光·李國安·巫有淦·張樹本·葉昭·王龍書。于耀庭·陳藉康·張義聲·周定一·王金篤。劉子中·史同心。梁會生·高紹傑·周恂·牟週海。曾天培·潘國瑛。于建生·葉年雲·任重道·劉福聚·朱若彭·郭壽松·賴森泉·李競冲·陶偉生·毛昭品·曹朝覺，以及機械士呂康西。</p>
<p>杭　橋上空　月中即開始活躍</p>
<p>敎官們辛辛苦苦的把絲蒂曼敎聯機由印度　河機場飛到杭州　橋機場來。除了王印若教官撞山于途中外，五十九架均平安抵達。目前可以使用者五十架以上，航校的初級訓練器材，在美國新貨到來之前，是沒有問題的解決了。　橋航校雖然在修繕房屋，但機場是完整的，油料補給也無困難，航空學生亦已分別由印度臘河搭機，來到筧橋，所似自五月十五日起，杭州筧橋上空即將恢復八年中斷的敎育飛行。</p>
<p>空軍新精神　有決心又有行動</p>
<p>第一階段的戰前筧橋，培植了八年抗戰的空中幹部，許多小夥十死於空戰或敵陣，受傷殘廢者亦不少。大部份在空軍各部隊中雙成空軍基幹，筧橋的天空與機塲雖在東南一隅，其精神實已籠罩全國，牽引至新大陸的亞美利加。第二階段筧橋開始了，由絲蒂曼六十架勇往直前的返國航行做信號，中國空軍的精神就是：「我有決心，我能行動！」</p>
<h3>如此解放區</h3>
<p>— 二日蘇北通訊　愛頻</p>
<p>當去年八月的秋風，吹散天上人間的烽烟時，世界將呈現出一番和平景象，然而在中國，在勝利後的中國版圖上，却仍此一處彼一處的瀰漫着烽　，假若說是爲「民主」而戰吧！那就該尊重「民」字才是道理，然而事實上攪得百姓們有家不能歸，有業不可營，在所謂「民主」的口號下，老百姓好像是多餘，老百姓是該死。</p>
<p>在半月前的蘇北，所棄家南來的，是一班長衫階級，目前迎最受共軍擁戴的勞工與「窮措大」，亦接踵而至江南，在運河綫國共交界的邵伯鎭上，除絡繹陸行不計外，河下舶有三百餘艘的快舟，專做運送難民的投機買賣，由蘇北各縣，逃到鎭江的難胞，日有千餘，多如過江之鯽，他們之所以忍痛拋下家園，而甘願流亡與地，亦不無有因，說來自然是不慣於「解放區」的種種「民主」政策了。且來記述一些關於「解放區」蘇北的動態。</p>
<p>「親民」標語　滿街張貼</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利以後，共軍每攻陷一城一鎭，第一步工作為發貼安民佈吿，其重要措辭是一般人民在抗戰期間，已飽受敵僞的蹂躪與摧殘，我們「民主政府」是特來「解放」你們的，其次的工作乃粉刷標語，用別出心裁的　體藝術字，在滿街巷的牆壁上寫着：「擁護毛主席，實行新民主」。「廢止一黨專政」，「新四軍是老百姓送來吃，老中央是要的吃，和平軍是搶的吃，鬼子是打的吃，」關於懲奸的標語有「大和尙〔「和尙」喻「漢奸」不要逃，小和尙不要溜，逃掉了和尙，逃不掉廟！」另在熱鬧市街，畫着巨幅的畫圖，上面寫着：「將來的日子怎麽過？」下面畫着蔣主席的首部，表示「將來」的「將」字是「蔣」字的代替，於是在另一邊的上角，畫着無數的新四軍，正向着徬徨無依的白姓們招着手。</p>
<p>勵行檢奸　不遺餘力</p>
<p>同時宣傳員便分組出發工作，在街頭在巷昆，在每一個角落裏，他們召集附近的苦力貧民於一處很親切地說出感人至深的話句：「……我們是來解放你們的，……我們知道，你們在這次反攻的時期裏，不得已而中止勞動，常然，這幾天來的損失，應該由我們補償，」用手指着一袋袋白米：「這些，是特地帶來給你們的，來呀……」一班貧苦的勞工們，見着一粒粒可以充饑的米糧，而不可抑止地表露出歡欣與愉悅，而後，宣傳員們也得意地狂歡了。「米，我們多得很，並且有大量的白米可以分配給你們，祗要你們能報吿出這街巷裏有何人曾做過漢奸，曾做過作惡的事……」這是關於檢奸的宣傳，對於檢舉地主與資本家的方式亦同，不過開塲白是：「你們以爲天下最不平的是甚麽，，……是貧富的不均，有錢的該活，沒錢的該死……」用許許多多很普遍的事實，來引起貧富之間的不平，於是階級鬥爭的萌芽，便在每個貧民的心底滋長起來了。當然這是窮人出氣的機會，他們抬了頭以後，一班長衫階級們，就被「短打行」擠跑了。可是到了目前，他們也相　難安，而紛紛逃到江南。</p>
<p>坦白大會　笑話百出</p>
<p>在檢奸檢「富」查悉以後，即實施逮捕，首先開「坦白大會」，用自己的嘴，當着衆人跟前，說出自已以往的種種過失，不可稍加隱秘，吾則將受嚴厲之制裁，且來記述一件關於「坦白會」上的笑話：</p>
<p>一次，某鎮開「坦白大會」，由區長主持其事，其間有一位號稱「一代允物」的風流徐娘，她的自我坦白是相當風趣的：「我從小就喜愛偸人，偸到現在已有一打多的人了，在這一打多裏，有着一位區長他……」說得這位區長目瞪口呆，啼哭皆非，眼睛白癡癡地望着這一位「英雌」，「英雌」更老老面皮說下去：『你望住我幹嗎？你還想賴嗎？那一天，我不是跟你在　　客棧喪開過一次房間？……」全堂哄笑不已。</p>
<p>套上蒲包　大罵自己</p>
<p>關於懲奸懲「富」，輕則套蒲包，像迎神賽會般地，前面大敲鑼鼓，將犯罪者夾在當中，頭上奮以道包，邊跑邊喊，自己開出自己的不是，後面跟隨着群眾，手各執旗，旗上寫著犯罪者的罪行，有一個漢奸的小老婆，套着　包避到熱鬧口，由工作人員把她架上一張木凳，由她自己向大眾說：「我是漢奸　　　的小老婆，　　　搜括來的民脂民膏，全用在我身上，我是死要錢，希望大家不要　我……」</p>
<p>人民公審　判處極刑</p>
<p>罪孽重者，則菲套蒲包所可卸其罪，另由人民公寓，在一個空　的大塲上，搭起一座高台，台上是工作人員與犯罪者，台下是成千成萬的民衆，首由台上宣佑其罪行，繼由台下補充其不足，而後台上問台下：「新四軍是最講道理的，歪理千條，正理一條，我們是民主政府，對於如何懲治，由你們人民做主……」凡為人民公審者，十九判以極刑，有謂均於事前授意，或工作人員夾於群眾之間，虛張聲勢，魅惑羣情，蓋被欲殺人，而假諸人民之手耳，是則「解放區」無非掠奪民意而已。</p>
<p>田園荒蕪　十室九空</p>
<p>在「與其鬥光，不如逃亡」的哀音下，蘇北的無辜百姓，都掏出了令人羡慕的「解放」名詞下的「解放區」，勞工窮民之所以也要拋下家的原因是：「在那裏沒有工作做，整天的你吃我，我吃你，一家分散幾處，有錢的是冲家了，窮人也散家了，我們的生活是極其簡單的，拿勞力去賣錢，拿錢來養家，一家過得融融洽洽的，然而現在不能，現在不能……」，據云兩淮至界首鎭一帶，種田是被吃光了，再也不願意去種田，有的是勞力，到處可以混飯吃，放下耕具走了，有地無人耕，有屋沒人住，至於不動的買賣，早數罕聞，現在有一句鄕語：「買田買地，狗　狗屁，賣田賣地，替祖家出氣，」中小學校，每校僅剩十數個學生，算是裝飾品，可見十室九空之一斑。</p>
<p>參軍壯男　披紅掛彩</p>
<p>在「解放區」裏，參車的壯男是至上至尊的，當參軍的第一日，當局的官員們，均親來致敬致視，大開盛筵用一頂像江南上小坐的「椅轎」，給參軍壯士坐着抬起來，身上像武松遊街一般的披紅掛彩，在鑼鼓喧天，樂聲大作中，遊到大街，遊到小巷，遊到村莊，遊到原野。</p>
<p>兒子參軍去了，父親即被衆人稱爲「參軍老太爺」，家屬的一切享受，均由別人去供論。沒有田、有地主來獻田。沒屋住，有人爲你砌造。田有別人代種，可以坐享其成，天大的禍事降臨，祇要有人去參軍，一切化爲島有</p>
<p>按「參軍條例」上的規定，是自由參加的，然而却有保長套「紙鳥龜」的事實，說他宣揚參軍不力。</p>
<p>你們居然還在說「一為老百姓而戰」的嗎？那麽，讓記者吿訴你們，老百姓已被戰得奄奄一息了就請息手吧！（五，二）</p>

<h3>請大家來評判！　共軍建立的「解放區」問題</h3>
<p>主筆先生：邇日共黨問題，已接近到必須判別是非的時期了。在政治上，一定要作一眞實檢討，以估計共黨的價値。上海各義披露此種文字已甚多。不佞爲一農家，吃苦耐勞，沒有資本家的氣味，封建的色彩，同時也是一個從事鄉村小學敎育的知識份子，淸淸白白。七七以後，就隱居了，廿九年以後又在共黨統制下隱居，所見所聞，大可作當局參考資料。今春到上海來的，也可說是逃出來的。下面一篇文字，請予發表。蒼上。</p>
<p>共產黨領導的新四軍。是在民國廿九年秋到達蘇北的。那時的蘇北是處在敵、僞、匪三者紛擾之下。新四軍來了先捉土匪，建立政權。縣長區長不斷的貼出佈吿，人民在久被壓迫之後，的確表示歡迎。許多知識靑年爲了抗日愛國的情緒毅然參加的，也不在少數。自然，共產黨憑了他的宣傳組織的本領，强調抗日不能還價，一步一步的深入社會的各方面，培植自己的力量，在無產階級工農大衆前面表示共黨是代表無產階級的利益的，在資產階級的士紳面前，他又表示共黨是實行三三制的，就是政權組成份子工農佔三分之一，小資產階級進步靑年三分之一，大資產階級開明士紳三分之一，顧到各階層的利益。殊不知其他三分之二，沒有黨的背景，沒有可以指導政治的黨的上司，還不是受共產黨支配？這是第一點。第二點所謂大小資產階級，並沒有尺度，一家人家十畝八畝，或二三十畝，或七八畝或百畝裏外的田地，或先前有三二十畝，現在經過子女分家，只有十畝八畝了，或當不到此數。這都是良民辛苦積蓄所置，多數且是祖遺，也可以說這是中國社會中堅人民最低限度衣食的來源，沒有道來源，敎他們怎樣生活呢？共產黨不去意這些，統統說他們是資產階級，隨意列在鬥爭的對像，似乎工、農生活所以這樣痛苦，不幸福，都是這班傢伙不是。甚至說抗日第一，打倒「資本家」是第二。唉！這班人都得稱爲資本家或地主嗎？還有第三點，共黨提倡民主，少數服從多數，社會上自然窮人多，無知識的人多，丸是開會舉手那能有他們多呢？但是我們要問：　國父淸末革命，無人附和，先知先覺的手舉起來只有一雙呀！</p>
<p>共產黨有許多理論，「似是而非」，或「矯枉過正」。他們不知道什麽是「過猶不及」，「差以毫厘，謬以千里」之意義的。在這種情形之下，於是有理說不淸了。農抗會，工抗會，商抗會，婦抗會，靑抗會，敎抗會，兒童團，伴工隊，調解會，查减隊，優抗會，代耕隊，動委會，民兵自衛隊，基幹隊，游擊隊，獨立團，巡邏隊，……不計其數的名目，不計其數的委員主任，幹事，會長，股長，組長，小組長，隊長，分隊長，大隊長……。這班人多數不識字，或一知半解，對於每一會社之用意，或某一職務之銜頭，大都不能了解，於是一朝權在手，就把令來行。」紛紛攘攘。竭盡爐人自擾之能事。他們也許有些可取的地方，只是在抗日裹面，包含着盲目的反抗中央，革命裏潛伏着不可收拾的破壞，只問目的不擇手段，而目的又是那樣的糊塗歪曲！</p>
<p>我們認爲中國這樣殘缺不全的社會，只有合作才能新生，萬不能硬把他分出許多階層，敎他們互相鬥爭，這是自殺。例如：工抗會組織成功了，第一步加工資，舉起了千萬隻手，雇主不勝負担時，自己老小動手，工人失業，或少做工，而雇主假定是敎師，也只好廢除筆墨，從事勞動，工農的孩子也就無處讀書，這樣社會就算進步了嗎？我們當然希望人人得到美滿的生活，但這不是一朝一夕所可就，需要多方創造合作才能。共產黨在蘇北除去創造了許多空名目，新口頭禪，無聊的累人的組織以外，在地方、實質建設上，如學校，工廠，這路，橋樑等，創造了多少？他們一定要强辯，共黨沒有到建設時期，試問工農一黨專政，置其他文化人，工程師，科學家於不顧，誰能培植來創透建設呢？這是自欺欺人！</p>
<p>眞正的大地主，資本家，我們也反對。只其中必須分別，不能把個人祇有物質生活的最低來源者，就指爲資產階級而二概打倒，這種人都倒了，立刻就是共產幸福世界，由毛主席供給衣食嗎？這是死不通的！例如：農抗會裏的佃農們，也有種一二十畝租田的，現在租籽减到很低很低，其他優待又多，租田等於自由，無產瞬成有產，是不是再要把他打倒呢？如不打倒他，則以前被打倒的太寃枉。我們認爲國父對於民生主義的理想，是要使社會上沒有大富小貧，換一句話說，大家是「小康」，大家都是能够過得去的中產階級者，這是真理，這是知識大衆所承認的眞理，應力促其實現，</p>
<p>共產黨還有一個手段，對外表面上說實行三民主義，而內裏宣傳則爲「新民主主義。」這主義的宣傳品，我也曾見過。除去什麼新三民主義，舊三民主義，革命的三民主義，不革命的三民主義等巧立名目外，沒有得到什麽。共黨還又標新立異，行什麽新民主主義的敎育，新民主主義的文化等，共黨又說我們先行新民主主義，次行社會主義，再次行共產主義。他們在重要集會時所懸的肖象，是馬克思，恩格思，列寧，史太林，毛澤東。後來鬼子投降了，偶然看見有孫中山先生及蔣主席的像。作者在共黨統制之下過了五年歲月，終於弄不淸共黨所抱的政治理想，及所實行的具體步趨是如何。</p>
<p>共黨所辦的冬學或夏學，秋學，即是他們的社會敎育。由學校敎育的書本上看，他們固然指中央專制，領袖是獨裁，他們更否認傍人的一切。只有他們自己是好的，別人就都不抗日，不革命。共黨又澈底否認孔孟之道，認爲孔孟的學說如禮義廉恥等，爲專制資產階級的護身符。他們的國語敎本全是宣傳主義；「歷史」又戴上了紅色眼睛，許多重要史實不講，只講原始共產社會的優美，後來的聖君賢臣都是專制或幫助專制者，「地理」只講共產軍何處有根據地，何處是解放區罷了。他們認敎育一定要爲進步的政治服務，敎育本身的價値將减削到零。試想在共黨統制下若干年後，敎育文化將到達一個怎樣的地步？這眞令人不寒而慄！</p>
<p>在共黨民主區域內，凡即稍有衣食來源源者，都是罪人，在開會時受人攻擊，在公役上增加工作，在捐稅上比別人繁重，在調解會上處處吃虧，上訴縣區政府，更是於你不利。只有大家弄到無產，然後可以翹首揚眉，得到當局的信任，可以辦「公務」講「公話」，故「泥腿子」之名一時大紅！</p>
<h3>「溫泉鄉」變成溫柔鄉　台北一雙明眸</h3>
<p>— 本報六日航訊　特派員　暮雲</p>
<p>北投與草山，是台北的一變明眸。</p>
<p>北投是惟一的溫泉縣，三面環着山：大屯，七星，紗帽，一則是遼闊的平野。因爲是琉璜的產地，所以到處都是泉眼。泉質有着土類泉，酸性泉，硫黃泉三種，溫泉五〇度到六八度，可以治療神經病，皮膚病，虐疾，糖尿病，婦女病。光褚二十年德人霍里發見，後給日人平田源吉首先開業；日本人在這大屯公園的溫泉區，化費了不少精力和財力，始蛻變爲今日之繁榮面。有三十多家的旅社，藉着小巧玲瓏的設置，和”夜不斷的溫泉，吸引着市區內的遊客。</p>
<p>草山是在七星和紗帽山標高四百米的懷抱里，有着較合北低着八九度的低氣溫，純是一個避暑山莊。這里的溫泉，一般的是比北投好，沒有太濃烈的琉璜氣，不過表面的繁榮，却遠不及北投。</p>
<p>這兩個地方有同一的特點，是散處在山腰，給綠色塗着的旅計之美，尤其左早晚霧氣未消，翠色的熱帶植物的影，更使人愛戀。這里有靜穆之美，也具省綺麗的靑春年華，像是一篇美麗的散文，又像是詩似的意境。</p>
<p>台北縣政府在這裏成立了個溫泉管理委員會，被接收的十六家和草山宜蘭的幾家旅社，都受該會的管理。現在是採取了甲乙丙了四種租賃的辦法，最高的月租是六千元，可是爲了接收的混亂，若干給各機關佔用了作俱樂部，若干開業的却是空空如也，据說出賃有黑市，最高價要數萬元。最近，一般的價格暴漲了，但在每星期六的晚上，却有着近千的公務員在這裏享受　華的夜，有五百以上的女人供給他們狂歡，每位的代價是抵小公務員半個月的薪金——五百元！</p>
<p>這種縱情享樂生活，和愁着沒夜飯米的公務人員的生活，正是個好對比，但受惠的旅社老閻，却害怕着，這給內地人帶來的惡劣的社會　尙的延長！溫泉鄕，如今是通地的「溫柔鄕了」！</p>
<h3>神灶巡禮</h3>
<p>渡海而來的日本人，最先就得朝拜台灣神社。</p>
<p>神社的「神域」，佔有廣褒的大屯火山羣劍潭山的南麓，面對着中山公園，穿過中山橋，就給偌大的木柱的影眾住了，粗近兩抱的檜木，抬起頭來，看到頂端，會使人感到費力的。這是作爲神社的啓示之門。也是作爲遙拜的「皇命者」之對象，如今却已高掛了「力行三民主義，遵奉總理遺敎」的大標語了。</p>
<p>人們很自然地感觸到時代變了，即是過往被「崇敬」的「神」的區域，也改變了面貌，這裹祀奉着「大國主命」「大已貴命」「少彥名命」及「北白川宮能久』，這些以武力刦奪台灣的侵略者，是被他們的軍閥崇之為「神」而給子孫們禮拜的，公署方面，主張以神社改爲民衆敎育館，可是在記者踏查以後，深覺這個改變的特冗，是不易使本人省接受的。</p>
<p>依着斜坡的石子路，朝着神社的正面走。由侵略者各社團一率仕」的石燈籠，破碎了蹲伏着的眼碩的銅牛，還是作爲發展台灣農業的象徵。我們打綠翠裏望開去，基隆河的淸流，淡水河的大橋，白帆，給綠色的山頭圍抱着，在「神」的窒息下，呼吸到盆地的自然的氣息。</p>
<p>神社的前應給駐了國軍，施燈的大柱破了，鐘亭消失了洪聲，庭並的錢筱空着，緊閉着的大門邊，橫列着一大堆的神匣子，楠木柱上畫着紊亂的刀痕，沒有人，沒有影，我們如人荒寂的古寺，月例二十八日祭沒有了，十月二十八日的大祭更成了個渺茫的月</p>
<p>步出了神社，在山麓看到了「殉難」警察的紀念碑，爲「皇國」盡忠的　士，在四十年前是被正義的「匪徒」殺戳了，海島　　民族性，這裏反映得很顚明。還在一尊三十三珊的老臼砲，是明治三十七，八年旅順戰役要塞的紀念品，還沒被風雨剝蝕得瘦削，却償還了血債。</p>
<p>神，人，被侵略者的「人」所播弄的領域，是給「神」也消失了踪影。</p>

<h3>關於工業建設</h3>
<p>— 林漢</p>
<p>戰爭勝利的結束以後，第一件繁重而迫切的工作便是建國。我國能否眞正成爲一個現代的國冢，能吾眞正的擺脫次殖民地的地位，躍爲五强之一，問題就在我們能吾在短的時期內，完成工業化，奠定建國的基礎。不平等條約取消了，勝利到來了，跟着，維繫和平的任務也就加重了！我國能吾肩起此項重任，那就要看我們有沒有操持和平，維護安全的實力。前年臘月底政府所公布的首期經建原則，就是針對着此項需要而定下的建設途徑，這些原則中特別重要的地方，就如翁部長所說：第一，政府獨營的事業包括郵電，兵工，鑄幣，主要鐵道，大規模水電廠外之經濟事業均可由人民經營，政府的活動係注重實際而必需國營的工業，許多大企業如石油礦，鋼鐵廠及航運等非民力可勝任者，政府仍可獨營或官民合辦，其他之經濟發展則歡迎私人企業努力。第二，關於歡迎外資之規定爲：對外資不加限制，凡中外合辦的事業，除董事長仍爲本國人外，共餘外人認爲不便的規定完全取消，中國政府對外人參加國營事業，除行使行政監督權外，對公司的日常事業，只行使股東的權利，並不橫加干涉，特就有關各項之論述，略爲綜述，以饗工建人士。</p>
<p>經建之目的在工業化，其體型則爲計劃經濟。「因工業與政治，相輔相成，其成敗利鈍則互爲因果。過去往往爲了工業家缺乏國家觀念，對國策法令少有硏究，而從事政治的人，對工業的重要性也沒有充分的認識，不知扶持工業爲自己職責，所以工業與政治形成脫節，工業的困難也就越來越多，因此我們如欲完成國家的工業建設，非促進工業與政治的聯繫不可。」（見蔣主席工建計劃會議演詞）故今後工業在政府領導扶掖下，工業界當與政府打成一片，其一切計劃和工作須與政府政策相符，以達成國家整個的工業化爲鵠的。</p>
<p>工業建設中的國營與民營一事，在經建原則上已有明文規定，凡有獨佔性的，以及民資所不及經營的皆歸國營，其餘有關民生的輕重工業，則極望私人企業能努力發展，兩者相關而行，本無抵觸之處。今以國營民營尙乏明確細則，國營事業有優越之特殊條件，而有與民爭利，打擊民營事業之嫌，此點極堪注意。至於輕重工業舉辦之先後問題，重工業爲國防所需，安全所繫，輕工業則爲富國利民所不可少，兩者俱備方足稱爲一個現代的國家；但重工業的建立却非輕而易舉的事，蘇聯三度五年計劃，苦心孤詣，忍饑耐寒了十幾年才得成功，我們朮工業必需建立，我們的力量就必須要集中，同時要準備吃苦一二十年才行！至於輕工業的建立，原則上由民間努力，政府予以誘導協護，工業界本身不能作軌外不合法之謀利（如囤積，投機），一切游資亦須轉而爲工建的資本。重工業的重心在交通工業，國防工業，輕工業的重心則在紡織工業，糧食工業，日用品工菜。在工業化及出口之條件下，此等工業之標準必須設立，以便成爲名符其實的工業化</p>
<p>工建的資本問題，亦即經建之資本問題；據伍啓元敎授的意見：「經建是使用大量資本的建設，資木的多寡，資本的機構情形……均影響經建極大。在首期經建中，與資本有關的第一個問題便是資本的數量問題，此數量問題又包括資本所需量與籌措兩項問題。資本的數量受着供盡關係的限制，一方面根據建國的要求，另一方面則根據國家的經濟力量。蘇聯第一個五年計劃中，每年經建資本的爲五十倍美元，有人據中國戰前的經濟情形，認爲我們無一妨每年籌集約二億元的資本，爲經建最低限度的投資數目，但估計起來，每年資本數目可列爲廿倍美元，五年共一百億美元。因中國經建須在戰事結束後二三十年內完成，在經建工作完成後，工礦交通事業的資本應接近八百億美元，故全部經建資本應不少於一千億美元。關於籌措方面，戰前中國每年國民所得約一百億美元（克拉克敎授估計的二百億，未免失之過高），戰前中國每年國民儲蓄的七倍美元，戰前中央財政支出每年平均約三億餘美元，法幣發行總額約四億餘美元，全國銀行存款約十四億美元，戰前每年資本輸入僅一億數千萬美元，華僑匯款不及一一億美元，從此種數字看，每年籌集廿億資本實非易事，祇是情形與戰前有了不同：（一）東北的收復，對經建資本的籌措極有帮助　。（二）國際局勢改變，中國國際地位提高，外資容易自友邦借款及國際機構（如國際銀行）取得。（三）戰爭損失賠償。這三方面的變一動可使吾人籌資較易。其籌集的一辦法爲：（甲）民族資本家佔廿一億，（乙）政府十億，（丙）自一賠償中提出卅億，（丁）外資四十億。國內資木的來源爲國民儲蓋，其增進之途為國民生產與節約兩種。外資的籌措方法略為：一（甲）美英戰後剩餘物資可供由國經建之用，據谷春帆氏之估計，美國復員後剩餘物資可作落後國家經建用者，共的二百七十億美元，英國剩餘物資可供落後國家經建用者，爲數亦必相當可觀，美英對此種物資之處置，有一部份可用以貸給中國及其他國家。（乙）借款作間接投資或直接參加經營。（丙）國際銀行貸款。（丁）戰爭賠償損失。」（見渝大公報星期論文）惟事實上，國人因　事之磨折，元氣大傷，尤其以農氏損失最重，再加以災荒疫　流行，吾人對戰後國人之收入剩餘與積器，不敢樂觀；且東北情形特殊，一切工業，交通設備大部為蘇方及共軍摧毀或拆卸，理想中之東北予經建之帮忙，已大形貶値。關於外資方面，據谷春帆先生旅美觀察之結果爲；「美國剩餘物資之處　。有新訂定之處置法案，而以物資儘速善價出售，且不擾亂市塲爲原則；其最重要之重工業，化學工業則幾乎非得國會同意不能處分，所以對踟餘物資，不能過份奢望有利於吾人。外商投資則均存觀望態度，在等候着中國政治的淸朗，序床的安定；且美人疑惑中國朝野雖口口聲聲說歡迎外資，而同時保護民族資本的狹義國家思想往往有得表現或見之立法，他們懷疑中國究竟歡迎外資否？一般說來，美國人對中國投資問題尙不感多大興趣，反之；美商却正想在中國找尋市塲。目前，美人投資多分是直接的，若要希望其借款或在美發售中國股票債劵，時機尙未成熟。」（見渝大公報）但由於經建原則之公布，以及最近國內局勢之變化，如停止軍事衝突之調處，政治之協議，政府之行將改組等設施（雖則刻下此種調處與協議已生問題，但吾人可堅信國家必須而且一定團結統一的），均將提高外人投資之興趣，令其投資放心，以及增進我國際地位及信用的。</p>
<p>工建的材料，即工業化之資源及設備；據吳景超先生硏究四十四稱與人民日常生活有密切關係的資料中。我國可有盈餘者八種爲絲，大豆，菜籽，煤，鎢，錫，銻，鹽；可可望自足的有廿八種爲米，麥，棉，蔴，糖，牛，羊，猪，馬，騾，羊毛，皮革，木材，石汕，鉬，錳，鎂，汞，鋁，硫，硝，鉀，燐，雲母，耐火材料，螢石，石灰及石膏；不能自足者爲橡皮，鐵，鎳，　，釻，銅，鉛及鋅。其中最嚴重的是鐵的總產量不及世界百分之一。設備方面，我國現有的設備，極度的貧乏與落後，實不足道。材料問題的解決，一方面亟須開源，生產；另一方面則應自友邦輸入大量機器及所缺的原料。</p>
<p>人才問題也是工建的基本問題，工業化便是機械化，必須有大量的技術及管理人才行。誠一如大公報所說：「蘇聯實行五年一計劃初期聘了不少外國工程師，一就趨勢看，我們將來也要借重外一籍人員參加工建，但無論如何，一我們必須自己有大批的二三流工業人才和外篇工程師配合，逐漸學習，且力領導。　這是很正確的說法，我國人才缺乏，是無應諱　的；今後所急需的便是工抆的幹部人員，如何養成此種人才，當然是敎育當局的責任。但是，生產廠家的廣羅藝徒，附設技工學校，也是一個收效很大的辦法。</p>
<p>總上所述，我們可知，我國工業建設本錢已不充裕，環境又不良，漫漫的艱苦途程，有待我們埋頭力行！當今國運盛宴轉捩的時候，時機迫切短暫而寳貴，願我們能急起圖强，把握住這千載一時的機會，捨棄一切，誓爲建設現代新中國而努力。</p>
<h3>藝術與工業</h3>
<p>— 王鸎</p>
<p>在美國新聞處所供給的資料中，有廣吿畫與工業一篇，原文如下：</p>
<p>「基督敎科學箴言報最近發表了一篇專文，內容說，現在費城舉行的『現代廣吿藝術展皆會」證明工業方面已可請職業藝術家爲它們的生產品繪製廣吿圖案以促進業務，因爲工業界的生產品可借助藝術家在各雜誌報章上以新的姿態呈現於讀者之前。據該報報導：自二月廿一日起在費城藝術聯盟內展覽的廣吿藝術作品，共有九十七件。最早的爲一九三七年，最近的作品則爲一九四五年。它說明了工業界已逢臨到一個好機會。不過箴言報却指出目前委托各藝術家描繪畫面美觀的生產品廣吿畫的公司也大見增加。</p>
<p>戰時政府各部院迫於戰事的需要徵聘重要藝術家製作公債，徵召等宣傳圖畫。在另一方面，廣吿公司亦以戰時廣吿應儘量簡單短小爲原則，是以也就檳棄複雜繪畫的方式。箴言報又說：費城展覽，證明天部日常用品將美化地呈現在報章雜誌廣吿欄中。</p>
<p>法國藝術家勒笳氏有二件作品參加展覽，他曾經評論近代藝術與工業的關係，他說：『工業家將愈益需要藝術家的作品。爲了協助工業界，我們已能在藝術和工業間建立一種新關係。這種關係當然是建立在社會利益的基礎上：它將為尤千人民開關一條欣賞當代藝術的道路。」」</p>
<p>勒笳氏所說的話是一點也不錯的，因爲藝術和工業之間，的確有很密切的關係，愛美是人類的火性，自從貨品的包裝起以至登載在報紙上的廣吿畫面止，全都要包括藝術的成分在裏面，否則將僅僅具爲一種外表，對於一般人的影響和整個社會人生，不能發生密切的關係。</p>
<p>許多新進國家，尤其是美國，在戰時儘量利用藝術，作爲宣傳的良好工具。其實到了建設開始的時候，更需要利用藝術，所以今後的中國，在建設工作方面，可以儘量利用藝術，使宣傳更能收效外，工業界也要重視藝術，使兩者能够打成一片，產生預期的效果。</p>
<p>然而談到這裏，一般人都感覺人才的缺乏，爲今後建設起見，儘速培養藝術人才，倒也是當一務之急。</p>
<h3>生產珍聞</h3>
<p>據粗略的估計，美國農產品中，有百分之十受到昆虫的毀害。</p>
<p>扁桃樹的產地是亞熱帶的中國，波斯，叙利亞，和小亞細亞。</p>
<p>黃豆現在是美國的字有魔力的農產品，百分之十三的食油是由黃豆製出，而旦是唯一含蛋白質最多的家咨飼料</p>
<p>煤，以前祗被認爲是熱和能的來源，現在已是人造羊毛，人造橡皮等的重要原料，而旦將來可能是汽車燃料的主要來源。</p>
<p>汽油可以在得克薩斯州附近的一個工廠表用天然煤汽製造；這個工廠每天用六千五百萬立方呎的天然煤氣製成五千桶汽油，和一千桶柴油。</p>
<p>爲了掩護軍事行動而發明的製霧機，現在已被用來散佈殺虫粉在田裏的農作物上面。</p>
<p>在沙皮還沒有發明以前，鯊魚皮是用來做磨擦物的。</p>
<p>爲戰時應用而發明的乾鷄蛋，將來或能廣汎的用來製造冰淇淋。</p>
<p>在智利北部發現的白雲石（dolomite）字有很有用的性質，白雲石可以用來做水力建築上的士敏土（HydarnlicCement）。</p>

<p>一個管理人員必須努力，使他所製造的貨品的數量，能够合於市塲上所雷要的數量，就是說不要生產得過多，因爲生產量超過了需要量以後，就要造成不景氣的情形。當美國在一九一九年的時候，製造廠的生產量超過了市場上實際所需要的數量，於是所有的貨品，擱置在銷行的史途，或是放在零售商的櫉架之上，沒有人去購買，或者這些貨品存在囤積者的手中，希望漲價而獲利，結果造成了一九二〇年的空前的市面不景氣。</p>
<p>所以爲了整個市場的福利起見，切不要有超過需要量的生產，而必須隨時使生產與銷售能够平均，一個管理人員，隨時要考慮下列的問題作爲他取決一切事務的根據：</p>
<p>一·是否要想方法獲得流動資金（如借款抵押等）去增加生產。</p>
<p>二·怎樣制定全年的銷售預算，這要顧到市面上一般人的購買力量怎樣？一般的經濟力量怎樣？如果一般人的購買力非常薄弱而我們偏在製造一種貴族化的貨品？那末我們勢必要不能銷售了。</p>
<p>三·購買原料應該立刻就買。還是稍爲等待一些時候，同時購買的數量，應該多少，也要加以考慮，因爲買得過少，就不敷應用，買得過多，就要减少流動資金。</p>
<p>四·關於薪工的增加，應該怎探處置，因爲這一點對於貨品的成本有密切的關係，但一方面也要顧到一般的生活程度，和一般的趨勢如何？</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Marshall, Broad Discussions on Recent Situation, General Gillem Meets with Zhou to Exchange Views</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Today is a regular holiday, but despite the immense difficulties, Special Envoy Marshall, seeking to achieve China's unification and solidarity, has not had a moment's rest from morning till night. This morning at 10:45 a.m., Marshall personally went to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's residence on Huangbo Road to pay his respects and hold important talks. It is said that the scope of the talks was extremely broad, lasting until after 12:00 noon. Chairman Chiang then invited Marshall to lunch. In the afternoon, when Marshall returned to his residence, he had discussions with General Gillem. It is reported that Gillem met with Zhou Enlai today and exchanged views on the current stalemate. According to well-informed sources, based on various signs observed yesterday and today, negotiations on certain minor issues have made some headway (including the issue of the Communist army's garrison areas in Hubei). However, the crux of the overall situation remains in the Northeast. It is hoped that the Communist army will no longer create disputes and generate additional complications at this critical juncture. It is believed that the wisdom of this peace envoy will certainly enable him to sort out this chaotic situation and propose a relatively compromise-based new plan in the near future. What can be reassuring to the people of the country at present is that the government's approach to resolving the overall situation, such as (1) the inviolability of national sovereignty, and (2) the necessity of alleviating the people's suffering, simplifies matters and speaks with sincerity, which is in line with the wishes of the people. Furthermore, according to news tonight, the situation in northern Jiangsu is tense beneath the surface, and the situation in North China is also becoming tense again. This is a detail worthy of the most attention. All parties in Nanjing hope that the Communist army will reflect in time. It is reported that Gillem plans to return to Beiping soon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] When General Gillem met with Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village at 10:00 a.m. this morning, Zhou stated that the Northeast issue had been complicated by the remarks made by Chief of Staff He Yingqin at a press conference on May 9th. When reporters inquired about this with a certain important official, the response was: this is another gesture of the Communists creating complications, because what Chief of Staff He stated on the 9th was all factual, and compared with the Communists' past clamor of "expanding the civil war in the Central Plains," the truth or falsehood is self-evident.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] After the announcement here that representatives of the government, the ruling party, and the Political Consultative Conference will soon depart Chongqing for Nanjing to participate in negotiations, hopes for an early resumption of peace talks have increased. Dong Biwu will definitely depart Chongqing by plane tomorrow, and Zhang Bojun is scheduled to depart for Nanjing on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 10th] (Delayed) After Zhou Enlai went to Xuanhuadian, when asked why the Communist Party avoided the important and dwelt on the trivial, not discussing the Northeast issue, Zhou said: "If we want to solve the Northeast problem, we must first solve the North China problem, and we must first solve the Central Plains Liberated Area problem." In general, people are quite perplexed and cannot understand Zhou's particular logic.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Hebei Province Attacks Cangxian, Military Mediation Department Orders Dezhou Group to Stop It</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 12th] The Communist army at Zhuanhe Station on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was driven back at noon on the 12th. The damaged railway tracks from Cangxian to Zhuanhe are currently being repaired.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 12th] Government sources say that the Communist army has launched extensive military actions in the Beiping-Tianjin area, and in the past few weeks, it has seized several neighboring towns. Three important railway stations have fallen into the hands of the Communist army, and a fourth station is now under their threat. The three captured stations are Botou, Fengjiakou, and Zhuanhe, located 90 to 70 miles southwest of Tianjin. Botou is the location of the 18th Executive Group of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 12th] The Communist army in North China is making major troop movements.

<h3>Mao Zedong's Trip to the Soviet Union Denied by the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] The Communist Party today dismissed as a malicious lie the report in the "National Salvation Daily" that Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong had flown to Moscow to consult with Soviet military leaders.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 12th] The National Salvation Daily reported that Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, has gone to Moscow to discuss the situation in the Northeast with Soviet officials.

<h3>Yingkou Iron Works Completely Destroyed, Restoration Will Take Five Years, Cultivated Land in the Northeast Abandoned, People's Food a Cause for Concern</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th] Lieutenant General Liu Guangji, commander of the Second Military Transportation Command of the General Logistics Headquarters, recently inspected various places in the Northeast. Liu told reporters upon his return: (1) Although the Yingkou Wharf was severely damaged by the Communist army, it has been repaired and can now be used with difficulty. He saw that the five important factories were all badly damaged, and the citizens who had fled were returning one after another. Prices are not high. (2) The extent of the damage to the iron works by the Communist army is infuriating. He asked a superior engineer, if the materials and labor were not a problem, how long would it take to restore it to its original appearance? The answer was that even if the materials and labor were sufficient and American technology was used, it would take at least five years. (3) Fushun can barely produce coal, and its maximum power generation capacity reaches 200,000 kilowatts, but three of the newest generators have been removed. The current generators are two small generators, which barely supply coal mining and Anshan. If it is restored to its original scale, that power plant alone can supply two-thirds of the electricity for the entire Northeast. (4) There are still many road materials piled up along both sides of the China Eastern Railway, but there is a shortage of sleepers. The sleepers are easy to burn and there is a large demand for them. (5) Agriculture in the Northeast originally relied heavily on electricity. After the victory, due to the destruction or obstruction of power sources, as well as the tragic killing of a large number of livestock, and the inability of the people to live in peace due to the war, more than half of the cultivated land has been abandoned, and a disaster is already forming. In particular, the Northeast, which is known for its rich agricultural products, has become a problem, and if this continues, the people of the Northeast will experience hardships unprecedented in their history. At the same time, due to the lack of electricity, processing costs are particularly high.</p>

<h3>Economic Construction is Impossible Without China's Unity and Solidarity, General Yarnell Says</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] Former Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Admiral Yarnell said today: "China cannot obtain any valuable construction unless China is united and unified." He also said: Reorganization of national finances is equally important. "Economic recovery is almost impossible until reorganization is complete. Fortunately, China still has some capable economists and financiers who can solve this problem." However, Yarnell issued a warning, saying: China's industrialization cannot solve the problem of mass poverty. He said: "Looking at the miserable situation of factories in Shanghai, or the existence of slums in large industrial cities in the United States, one can understand this." He said: The complete development of China's industry must be based on the following three principles: (1) Factories must be far away from urban centers, that is, factories should be distributed throughout cities and villages across the country. (2) Workers should share in the profits of industry, so as to avoid labor-management struggles. Chinese industrial cooperatives are good models. (3) Workers should have appropriate housing, fair wages, and hygienic factory equipment.</p>

<h3>The Supreme Court's Ruling on the Miao Bin Case: Original Sentence Upheld; Traitor Lu Yiwen Sentenced to Death by the Yunnan High Court</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Bureau, 12th] Sun Honglin, President of the Jiangsu High Court, and Han (name missing), Chief Prosecutor, went to Nanjing on the 6th to report on their work.

<h3>Moscow Radio Broadcasts Slanderous Attacks Against Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] Moscow Radio broadcast this morning made unfounded accusations and unjust criticisms against General Yan Xishan.

It further claimed that there were currently 40,000 Japanese prisoners of war in Shanxi Province, who were being reorganized by Yan Xishan, with guidance from officers from a certain major power, with an agreement to work together for (anti-communism). After this broadcast was published in the evening newspaper, a National Assembly representative who had recently arrived in Nanjing from Taiyuan told this reporter that if the Communist army had not destroyed the railways, the Japanese prisoners of war in Shanxi would have already been completely transferred. Despite extremely difficult transportation conditions, Shanxi was still able to transport 3,000 Japanese prisoners of war out of the city daily last month. This is an undeniable fact, and foreign and domestic news agencies and Associated Press reporters are welcome to visit. As for whether Yan Xishan's army colluded with the Japanese, there are also bloody facts that can be investigated.</p>

The main points were that the Communist army's disturbances and destruction of transportation have led to factory shutdowns and commercial stagnation. The situation in Henan is especially dire because the Communist army has caused extensive damage at the Huayuankou on the Yellow River, expanding the disaster area to 38 counties, affecting as many as 8 million people. Refugees are everywhere, and industry and commerce are nearing stagnation. After presiding over the Business Federation meeting, Wang Xiaolai took the evening train back to Shanghai tonight.</p>

We have read with inspiration the Chairman's address to the representatives in Nanjing. We believe that constitution-making and governance are the established policies of the government, and the building of the nation depends on them. To procrastinate over trivial matters would disappoint the people. We have carefully considered public opinion and deeply feel that the people's will should be gathered as soon as possible, and a decisive decision must be made. We hope that you will see the situation clearly, make a decision soon, convene the assembly, and not delay it any longer. The affairs of the nation should be entrusted to public opinion, and unification can be achieved."</p>

<h3>Dancing is Prohibited in Kunming, but Dancing is Still Popular</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Bureau, 10th] Dancing is increasingly popular in Kunming, and the competition among dance halls is fierce. The investment in newly established dance halls is estimated to be between 30 million and 200 million yuan. One hall recently hired a band and two singers from Shanghai at a cost of 60 million yuan. The First Session of the First Yunnan Provincial Assembly suggested that the government ban dance halls, which was approved by the Yunnan Provincial Government and ordered the police bureau and the Kunming Municipal Government to strictly ban them. The managers of the dance halls petitioned the provincial and municipal authorities to withdraw the order, but were not approved. It is said that because the investments have not been recovered, the halls will inevitably suffer huge losses. There are plans to change the business model, and some are planning to move underground. All middle schools in Kunming now restrict students from dancing, but it is heard that some collectively climb over the walls to participate in dance parties. Some even dance in classrooms at school. As for the common social gatherings in Kunming, tea dances are still popular, with 17 pairs of men and women dancing all night, costing up to 3 million yuan.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Assists China in Managing the Yellow River</h3>
<p>And Sends Senior Personnel to China to Investigate Famine Areas</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that the Chinese government, with the assistance of American engineer Todd, has begun work to restore the Yellow River to its original course, so that 800,000 hectares of land deliberately flooded in 1938 to prevent the Japanese army from advancing can be restored for planting. Currently, 100,000 workers are working under Todd's supervision, and the food for the workers is supplied by UNRRA.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 11th] According to Dr. Guo Bingwen, Director of the UNRRA Secretariat, a group of senior UNRRA personnel will come to China at the end of this month at the invitation to inspect the disaster areas.

<h3>The United States Adopts a New Reparations Policy for Japan's War Losses, Enabling Japan to Restore Production Capacity</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] Concurrently with the arrival in Japan of American Reparations Commissioner Pauley, well-informed sources announced that Washington officials are adopting a more practical policy regarding Japan's war losses. It is heard that the new reparations policy will enable Japan to restore a production capacity, allowing Japan to begin to embark on the road to recovery, and the United States will not have to permanently take care of its livelihood. Although this policy has not yet been announced, it is understood that it will specify both minimum and maximum production capacity statistics. The maximum production capacity statistics specify what the Japanese economy cannot sustain, while the minimum production capacity statistics specify what Japan can be self-sufficient with on the four main islands. This policy will allow Japan to understand its total production and encourage the recovery of industry. The Japanese people are currently shrinking back, fearing that their industrial equipment will be used for reparations. After these statistics are specified, they can be reassured on one hand, and the control of various military production such as steel, coal, oil, light metals, and chemicals will not be relaxed. After the reparations are determined in the future, the countries applying for reparations cannot hope to immediately obtain what they want. According to experts from MacArthur's headquarters, even if the reparations settlement is announced tomorrow, it will take at least six months for the designated reparations goods to be transported from Japan to the countries applying for reparations.</p>
<h3>Bao Lai Writes to MacArthur, Explaining the Purpose of Compensation</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Daily Tokyo, 12th] Bao Lai, the U.S. Compensation Commissioner, wrote to MacArthur, stating the mission of his visit to the Far East: The U.S. Compensation Committee, in November and December of last year, investigated Japan's political and economic productive capacity needs, as well as its future war-related productive capacity. In addition, Japan's demilitarization, financial control, decentralization, and democratization are all extremely important. Particularly important is the removal of Japan's war capabilities within the industrial sector to the areas it previously occupied. The purpose of this committee is to sever Japan's relationship with these areas and rebuild their economies to help Asia establish a peaceful and prosperous economic balance. The fundamental purposes are detailed as follows: (1) To study the extent of industrialization developed by Japan in Korea and Northeast China, and how these industrial activities are connected to Japanese industries, while also discovering Japanese assets in these areas that can be used for compensation. U.S. policy is to use all Japanese assets found in China (including the Northeast) and Korea for compensation to these countries. (2) In light of the changes since the armistice, it is necessary to understand the current situation in Northeast China and North Korea, and to estimate how these changes will affect the livelihoods of China and Korea. (3) Regarding the industrial capacity in East Asia and Korea, it is proposed to remove this equipment from Japan and allocate it to China and Korea. To this end, the maximum consideration should be given to China, Korea, the Philippines, and other countries that have suffered as a result of Japanese aggression, in order to complete their economic development. [Remodeling Daily Tokyo, 12th] U.S. Compensation Commissioner Bao Lai told reporters yesterday: The purpose of compensation is to remove equipment that may become a potential force for war, while equipment necessary for the economic life of the Japanese people will not be removed. Japanese assets in China (including the Northeast) and Korea will be reserved for compensation purposes to aid the reconstruction of Asia. In short, equipment used for compensation should not be regarded as occupied goods, but should be considered with the aim of reviving the entire Far Eastern economy. Bao Lai also stated that the Soviet authorities have not yet allowed him to enter the Northeast, but he believes that he will be granted permission soon.</p>

The fake Cao Jinsheng, who claimed to be a pilot and forged documents in an attempt to defraud, has been interrogated by the military law office of the 21st Army. According to his confession, he took this course of action due to financial difficulties, and had committed similar acts of impersonation and fraud in Zhenjiang and Wuhu.

<p>Jiading</p>
<p>County Government Captures Notorious Murderous Bandit</p>
<p>Tan Sixi, a local thug from the western countryside of this county, engaged in murder and robbery during the Chongqing era, rampaging through the borders of Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading, and Qingpu counties. Relying on his numerous followers and ruthless methods, even after the victory, the victims were still intimidated by his power and dared not openly accuse him. Since the current county magistrate Xu Zhuyi took office, he has made it his mission to eliminate violence and bring peace to the people. News of this spread, and the family of Cui, a martyr who died resisting the Japanese, filed a complaint with the county government, accusing Tan Sixi of colluding with the enemy police and harming loyal people. County Magistrate Xu first arrested the suspect and then collected evidence to bring him to justice. It has recently been discovered that in addition to setting up checkpoints to collect taxes and extort money from the people during the local occupation, the suspect also engaged in kidnapping for ransom, colluding with the enemy police, and committing various other crimes against good people. Most infuriatingly, he was responsible for the group slaughter of anti-Japanese patriots, with as many as twenty or thirty people killed in one incident. It is reported that the county government is now issuing a public notice to the families of the victims, inviting them to provide evidence and formally file a complaint.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>

Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of the province who was in custody, was also brought in as a witness. Chen's lower body was paralyzed, and he could not walk, so he was carried into the courtroom by bailiffs. Judge Fu Jin questioned them one by one. Zhang Pinquan and others all stated that He Peixuan was forced to take the puppet position, and that he did indeed assist in rescuing many underground comrades. Chen Zemin also stated that He had resigned four times during his tenure, but he had not approved it because there was no one in Jiangyin to succeed him. Chen confirmed that He was a sincere and honest person, unlike the scum of the earth. After the questioning, the court determined that since many witnesses had been called and the investigation of the case could be concluded. A debate hearing will be held next time, and a judgment can be made.</p>
<p>Measures for Controlling Rice and Grain Determined. The County Government's Department of Land and Grain previously received a letter from the County Provisional Assembly requesting that measures be taken to strictly prohibit the export of rice and prevent Shanghai merchants from coming to Shanghai to purchase rice, in order to maintain the stability of the people's food supply. The department has now drafted various effective measures to control rice and grain in the county, and has submitted them to the provincial government. Once approved, they can be implemented.</p>
<p>Gao Guanwu's Property Not Confiscated. Gao Guanwu, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, and Huang Xunjingzhai, the puppet director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, used the wealth they plundered from the people to purchase more than 2,000 mu of good farmland in the suburbs while holding their puppet positions. At that time, they used aliases and changed their names, attaching them to the landlord Shen Yigu's store for rent collection, in order to conceal their actions. After the victory, although this secret was discovered by the county government, no action has been taken. Last winter, Shen's store continued to collect rent. Tenant farmers, unaware of the situation, enthusiastically paid the rent to the store. To date, the property has not been reported to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui enemy-puppet property handling bureau for confiscation, and the county government has not taken appropriate and fair measures, which is clearly in violation of national laws and regulations. This has been exposed by the Dajiangnan Daily, a newly published newspaper in this county. The future of the situation may expand and be thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Female Traitor Translator Indicted.

In December of last year, Lin Damei lived with the Japanese fugitive Rijian Tarou, hiding in the countryside. The fifth district chief sent police to arrest them and send them to the county. In addition to the Japanese criminal Rijian Tarou being sent to the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, Lin Damei was also sent to the Suzhou High Court last month. Prosecutor Gu Kejian has filed an indictment, alleging that Lin Damei willingly served the enemy. Her actions constitute a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Encouraging All Sectors to Assist in Opium Prohibition.</p>
<p>The County Government, in accordance with provincial orders, has specially promulgated post-cleanup measures to eliminate opium. In accordance with the provisions of Article 8, it is necessary to encourage autonomous organizations, schools, social groups, and public-spirited individuals to jointly organize opium prohibition associations, which will be established immediately.

For the convenience of traffic between Lake Tai and Changxing, the First Pacification District Changxing Command has specially prepared four vehicles to travel between Changxing Lijia Port and Hucheng, with two shifts per day, and a fare of 1,500 yuan per person. The service started on the 8th, and passengers on the Wuchang route hailed it as convenient.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Joint Re-survey of City and County Boundaries.</p>
<p>Due to the enemy's occupation for the past eight years, the original boundaries between Hangzhou City and Hangzhou County have become unclear, and the alluvial areas along the river have changed over time and environment, requiring urgent re-surveying. Yesterday, Xu Zhongwei, the head of the Land Administration Section of the City Government, and Shang Ruifen, the section chief of the Hangzhou County Government, went to re-survey the area based on the records of 1936. They first went to the coastal area east of the city. The boundary stones and archways there had been destroyed. The Dike was identified as the boundary, and the area south of the boundary belonged to the city, while the area north of the boundary belonged to the county. Then, they went to Xiaoshhe near the northwest of the city, and identified Kangjia Bridge as the boundary. The triangular area along Gongsan Road belonged to the county, and the area southwest of the city along the Hangfu Road took Liufangling as the boundary, and the main channel of the Qiantang River took Dadao Sand as the boundary. Most of the boundaries were still clear, and some needed to be adjusted with the consent of both parties before submitting them to the Ministry of Interior for approval.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Our New Enemy – Famine!</h3>
<p>In recent days, rice prices in Shanghai and other places have soared again. The Shanghai market has already jumped out of the 50,000 mark, making every person feel the threat of food shortage, especially the common people, who are in a state of panic all day long. Food is the most important thing for the people, and the food problem is indeed the most serious problem at present. "Famine" has become our new enemy. Today, no matter what aspects of politics, economy, or society, if we cannot solve the food problem, everything else is out of the question. But how to overcome this "famine" enemy? It's really not a simple question.</p>
<p>Shanghai is currently suffering from the threat of soaring rice prices, and various provinces and cities are also experiencing famine. Even in any corner of the world, there are large numbers of hungry people waiting for compassionate philanthropists to provide relief. According to Chen Zhima, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States, in his recent report to the United Nations: "The number of hungry people in China has increased to 30 million, and the food supply situation is getting worse. The food shipped to China by the United Nations in the first quarter of this year is only enough for the hungry people to consume for one day." Lai Jiadi, the director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, also frankly stated that he is particularly concerned about the famine in China. He said: "I think the famine in China is too horrible to bear, but I hope that people of all countries will not be indifferent to this large-scale famine and death." At the same time, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported on the world food situation, saying that food production in the Far East and Europe is still below pre-war levels, and it is expected that the famine next year will still be serious, and 1947 may not be better than this year. From this, we can see that the food panic is not a problem of one corner or one country, but a problem of the entire world. World problems must be solved by gathering the thoughts and efforts of all mankind. China is one of the countries with a more serious world food shortage, and the Chinese people should use the spirit and strength of resisting the brutal Japanese in the past to unite with the more powerful and generous Allied countries to fight against "famine," the new enemy, and must overcome this new enemy before giving up.</p>
<p>The chairman of the American Relief Committee, former President Hoover, in view of the severity of the world food shortage, was ordered by President Truman to go to Europe and the Far East to investigate the food supply situation in various countries. He has already returned home to report, and it is expected that there may be brilliant plans to be announced soon. However, judging from Hoover's remarks after returning to the United States, "The danger of famine in various parts of the world is extremely great. If relief food is not delivered soon, millions of people in the areas with the most severe famine will become starving corpses," we can know that in addition to appealing to the American people to generously provide relief to the hungry people, he may not have more appropriate measures. Even this alone shows that in order to resist famine, in addition to extreme frugality and vigorous relief, there are really no other brilliant plans.</p>
<p>China is originally an agricultural country, and more than 80% of the national population depends on agriculture for a living. In principle, there should be no food shortage problems. However, China's agricultural technology is still backward, and it already feels a shortage of food in normal times. Moreover, it was the earliest and longest resistance war, and the war spread to the whole country. The losses suffered by the people are almost impossible to count with numbers. In the past few years, the rural areas in the occupied areas have been ravaged by the enemy puppets, presenting a fragmented and tragic scene. In the rural areas in the free areas, not only did they provide a large number of human resources to defend the motherland, but they also contributed countless financial and material resources to support the country's wartime finances and military food. Therefore, they also presented a desolate phenomenon of abandoned fields. The result of the eight-year war of resistance certainly won the victory, but it could not save the bankruptcy of the rural areas, or even accelerated the bankruptcy of the rural areas. Thirty million war refugees have no home to return to, wander in foreign lands, without warm clothes or enough food, and have become pitiful and helpless hungry people. If we cannot find a way to provide relief, they may all become starving corpses. The United Nations, at the end of the war, had already anticipated the difficulties in the world after the war and had to find a way to provide relief. Therefore, there was the organization of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the situation in China was even more serious, so the Executive Yuan added a Relief Administration to assist the United Nations in handling relief matters. However, since its establishment, its achievements have been difficult to satisfy, which is an undeniable fact. Even Lai Jiadi himself, the director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, is worried about the future of the United Nations. He frankly stated: "In the current situation, the stock of grain is not sufficient, and the United Nations cannot know how much grain it can obtain next month. If this situation continues to prolong, the United Nations will also be in danger of collapse." If the United Nations is like this, the Relief Administration is even more unnecessary to mention. It is said that the salaries of the employees of the Relief Administration in a certain province are still in arrears, so where is the energy to relieve the food shortage?</p>
<p>The situation of food shortage in our country is so serious, and the relief from the United Nations inevitably has a feeling of "distant water cannot save a fire." We can only first devote all our efforts to the path of "self-reliance," and then promote the common attention of the Allied countries to jointly eliminate the threat of food shortage in China. We believe that the most urgent tasks at present are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>First, on the negative side, we should advocate extreme frugality and implement the distribution of grain according to population, and use the saved materials to relieve our compatriots who are dying. Judging from the living conditions of ordinary workers, peasants, and public educators, frugality is already impossible, and most of them are struggling on the hunger line, so it seems impossible to talk about frugality. However, we have also heard that a few workers are actually using the increased wages to squander meaninglessly. What's more, those who made a fortune from the national crisis during the war of resistance are obvious to everyone. They should generously provide relief to these 30 million compatriots, whether in terms of morality or strength at this time. But looking around, those corrupt and treacherous people who made a fortune only know personal enjoyment and squandering, and their extravagance is endless. They have never thought that there are still 30 million hungry people waiting to die in the country. Especially in Shanghai, a society of paper drunk gold fans, they can be seen everywhere living a corrupt and licentious life. The government does not ban it, and society does not blame it, which makes people unable to believe that China is experiencing a famine! We must not allow this situation of "red mansions smell of wine and meat, and roads have frozen bones" to exist for another day. Foreign journalists have already lamented "China is hungry, Shanghai is dancing." The capital of the National Government has recently issued an order to ban dancing, but Shanghai, this corrupt and licentious society, is still eating and drinking, singing and dancing in peace. Where does that come from! Recently, Marshal Eisenhower came to China and said, "America is willing to help those who can help themselves." This is really worth our vigilance and reflection. Our government should decisively prohibit all wasteful and extravagant lifestyle behaviors and begin to implement a frugal policy of distributing grain according to population. It is said that in the past few days, a certain telephone company bought hundreds of piculs of rice, and a certain household bought dozens of loads of rice. This unconscious hoarding of grain, as well as the rice merchants' reluctance to sell, should be severely punished. All restaurants and restaurants should strictly formulate rules to prohibit excessive consumption of grain. In terms of consumption, only by implementing frugality across the country and tightening our belts can we overcome the new enemy of "famine"!</p>
<p>Second, on the positive side, we should strive to increase agricultural production on the one hand, and negotiate the purchase and transportation of foreign rice to China on the other hand. We believe that if the whole country, from top to bottom, can do their best, China's grain production can be improved and increased. The two methods proposed by President Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood for improving China's agriculture, one is "land to the tiller," and the other is "agricultural mechanization," are both the most urgent and should be implemented at present. However, the implementation of these two policies first requires a good environment, that is, an atmosphere of peace and stability and a clear and capable local government, so that farmers can settle down and engage in farming. Otherwise, no matter how brilliant the ideal or how practical the method, it is still impossible to increase agricultural production. Therefore, we ask the government and the Communist Party to earnestly fulfill the "nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics." In other words, the Communist Party should immediately abandon the policy of provocation and destruction, and the government should immediately restore transportation and reorganize the army. Otherwise, it will not only be impossible to increase agricultural production, but it will also increase the severity of artificial famine, leading to endless troubles. If we can be frugal ourselves and restore domestic peace and stability, then we have full rights to ask the Allied countries with surplus grain to not only transport grain to relieve the famine in China, but also allow China to purchase large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas such as Siam and Annam, so that rice prices in our country can be reduced and the general people's food supply can be maintained.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that is worth providing for research, that is, using scientific methods to study the minimum amount of food consumption per person and stipulate that everyone must abide by it. This will not only save food, but also maintain people's health. During the war, because of the reduction of food imports, the United Kingdom had to implement the method of distributing grain according to population. Nutrition experts designed a good method, which was still implemented in the same way after the victory and will be maintained for another five years. The United Kingdom is a rich and strong country, and it is still like this. Since China suffers from poverty and is plagued by food shortages, how can we allow the phenomenon of "unevenness" to exist in society again? Everyone only consumes the minimum amount of food, which is the best way to overcome famine!</p>
<h3>The Indian and Muslim Sides Insist on Not Compromising: Simla Conference Fails; Nehru and Jinnah Continue Talks Yesterday; British Side Considers Future Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): The Simla Round Table Conference officially concluded today. Detailed results have not yet been released. However, according to a special correspondent for the BBC, the conference has failed. Although the formal meetings have ended, discussions are still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Simla, 11th] Nehru met with Jinnah this morning for an hour. Political observers predicted after the meeting that the Round Table Conference might not be as fruitless as recent rumors suggested.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Simla, 12th] The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League have so far failed to reach an agreement. The Muslim League also rejected the proposal to submit the matter to international arbitration. According to informed sources, the British Cabinet representatives' talks with the Indian and Muslim factions on Sunday were inconclusive. A communiqué may be issued on Sunday explaining the failure of the negotiations. Observers speculate that the British Cabinet representatives have contacted Prime Minister Attlee to discuss measures to be taken after the failure of negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Simla, 11th] Although the leader of the Indian Muslim League, Jinnah, and the president of the Congress Party, Nehru, are in close talks, negotiations are bound to break down. The Congress Party demands the establishment of a strong central government controlling all of India's foreign affairs, national defense, transportation, and a portion of tariffs. The Muslim League insists that areas where Muslims are concentrated must be granted independent self-governance. A spokesperson for the Muslim League openly stated their fear that if Hindus gain power, they will be politically and economically suffocated. Various plans have been proposed in the past to reconcile the two sides, but they quickly vanished.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Former British Colonial Secretary Amery said: "I am extremely disappointed to learn of the failure of the Simla talks." Conservative politician Winterton just said: "I have always known that the British delegation's attempt to mediate between the Indian and Muslim factions was impossible, so I am not surprised by the failure of the talks."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] A local figure, Tevadas, declared to the press here today that if India's opposing parties do not seek reconciliation on their own, civil war is likely to break out. But in any case, India's independence can be achieved within a few months.</p>
<h3>Government's Negotiations with Azerbaijan Province Break Down; Iran Faces Internal War Crisis; Tabriz Radio Station Declares "Willing to Shed Blood"; Iranian Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): Negotiations between the Iranian government and Azerbaijan province have completely broken down. The Azerbaijani delegation will leave Tehran and return to Azerbaijan. Iranian troops are currently concentrated on the border of Azerbaijan province. The Azerbaijani authorities have ordered the provincial army to be on high alert and will fiercely strike any Iranian army that crosses the border.</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): The Iranian Cabinet held an emergency meeting today. Some ministers stated that if the government continues to yield to Azerbaijan, they will all resign. Iran's situation has become even more chaotic due to the entanglement in the Azerbaijan issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 12th] The Tabriz radio station recently announced: "Negotiations between the Iranian government and representatives of Azerbaijan province have broken down." The radio station also said: "The people of Azerbaijan will never submit to the oppression of the central government. For twenty-five years, Azerbaijan has repeatedly fought for freedom. Today, the people of Azerbaijan are ready to fight against the enemies of freedom. We need peace and are willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution, but certain elements in Tehran are trying to take advantage of the situation. Our representatives argued with them on the basis of reason but were still interfered with. Our representatives are now leaving Tehran on their way back. We are also prepared to respond to any changes, but everyone should know that the fault is not ours. This is because the central government is unwilling to eliminate the elements that are destroying Persia. We now specifically announce to all countries that we are prepared for war and have ordered the National Army and the Democratic Party on the border that if any troops from the central government attempt to enter the territory, they should be resisted. We Azerbaijanis will fight them and never give up freedom and autonomy. We will match our words with our actions, and we are willing to shed blood for this."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 12th] An Iranian cabinet member said that negotiations with Azerbaijan province have broken down, but this was denied by a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson. At the same time, the government has sent an army colonel and a civil official to inspect to verify whether the Red Army has indeed completely</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 11th] According to sources here, negotiations between the central government of Iran and representatives of Azerbaijan have stalled. Although Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Shatskov, intervened to mediate, it was to no avail. The crux of the negotiations lies in the security issue after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan province. The provincial representatives requested to automatically restore security, but the central government authorities believe it is necessary to send troops to the province to maintain security.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 12th] The Azerbaijan National Army has taken over all the barracks in the province after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops.</p>

<h3>French Troops Mass on the Banks of the Mekong River; Bombarding the Siamese Border; Siam Asks Britain and the United States to Protest to France</h3>
<p>"Reuters, Bangkok, 12th" The Siamese Foreign Minister confirmed that French troops bombarded Nakhon Phanom on the Mekong River on the Siamese border on Wednesday night, and machine-gunned Thai rice paddies. Public and private buildings in Nakhon Phanom suffered considerable damage, and many residents were injured, two of whom are beyond hope of rescue.

<h3>French-Vietnamese Conference Ends Without Result</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 12th] The French and Vietnamese authorities recently issued a joint statement stating that the preparatory meeting held in Dalat on the 11th has ended. After more than 20 days of discussions during the meeting, the French and Vietnamese sides failed to reach a complete agreement on issues such as Vietnamese foreign policy, the status of Cochinchina, the Vietnamese monetary system, trade between France and Vietnam, and the use of French in Vietnamese schools. Representatives from both sides believed that the gap in opinions was too wide to bridge, and continuing the meeting would not resolve the issues, so they hastily announced the closing of the meeting on the 11th. Both parties agreed that all unresolved issues would be discussed again at the Paris conference at the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Grasping Human Relations, Peace Will Be Guaranteed; Tolerance and Understanding Will Prevent War From Occurring; President Truman Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 12th] President Truman, while receiving an honorary doctorate of law from Fordham University here yesterday, stated that grasping human relations is the only way to prevent the atomic bomb. He briefly stated that after an atomic war, there would be no civilization left. The first sentence of the UNESCO charter is "Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed." Therefore, we must eliminate ignorance to prevent the world from suffering another disaster. Knowledgeable people would never hate each other because of differences in religion, language, customs, or race. Therefore, education is the foundation of international understanding and world peace. Knowledgeable Americans would never be unconcerned about people from other countries. They know that attitudes of exclusivity and dictatorship are based on selfishness. From past experience, despotism and dictatorship will never stop at our borders. The lessons of World War II and the atomic bomb make us deeply aware that we cannot survive without working hard. There is only one way to defend against the atomic bomb, which is to grasp the science of world human relations and cultivate an attitude of tolerance and understanding. After carefully studying this relationship, we will realize that Hiroshima is not the end of human civilization, but the beginning of a new world.</p>
<h3>US Asks Britain to Cede Three Pacific Islands; to Establish Naval Bases</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 11th] A New York Times diplomatic correspondent announced today that the United States has notified Britain that it wants to secure its sovereignty over three small islands in the Pacific: Christmas Island, Funafuti Island, and Canton Island. The first two islands belong to Britain, and the latter is jointly owned by Britain and the United States. According to the correspondent, there should be no difficulty in the British government ceding these islands. The current issue is the dispute over other bases in the Pacific. Some people in the United States advocate increasing the number of islands controlled by the United States in order to establish a string of interconnected bases. If Britain cedes these islands, these people will achieve a decisive success. However, this is the view of the Navy Department. As for the State Department, it advocates the establishment of a common defense system, with the United States, Britain, China, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand responsible for protection.</p>
<h3>US Electrical Strike Ends After More Than 100 Days</h3>

<h3>Tokyo Communists Lead People; Raising Red Flags; Breaking Into the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Daily, Tokyo, 12th] Residents of Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, held a ward residents' meeting today, with about ten people participating. They shouted slogans such as "Brothers and sisters are starving to death," "Food should be managed by the people," "Smash the reactionary forces," and "Establish a people's republic." Communist Party Central Committee member Nozaka Sanzō personally attended and spoke, saying that the people are about to starve to death, but landlords and officials are hoarding rice in their warehouses. This matter should be asked of the Emperor. After the meeting, the crowd split up and marched to protest in the city. One team of 113 people, led by Communist Party member Iwata Hideichi, went to the gate of the Imperial Palace, demanding to enter the palace. It was finally decided to meet with officials from the Higher Palace Office and the Ministry of the Imperial Household. The crowd then raised red flags and entered the Imperial Palace, creating an unprecedented event in Japanese history. After the crowd entered the palace, they demanded to see the Emperor's dining room. The palace officials then led them to the Chrysanthemum Leaf Restaurant. The crowd, seeing that the room was narrow and dirty, said that it was not the "Emperor's dining room" and questioned the officials endlessly. They finally admitted that it was the staff canteen. The crowd was in an uproar and declared that they would send representatives to hear the Emperor's reply at 2:00 PM on the 14th, and then left.</p>
<h3>Miss Panda "Union" Arrives Safely in London by Plane; China to Find Her a Mate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Miss Panda "Union," born 17 months ago and weighing 80 pounds, arrived in London by plane from Calcutta last night and settled in a yellowish-gray iron cage in the Lion House of Regent's Park Zoo. "Union" is the fourth panda owned by the London Zoo and the only panda in Europe. The zoo's original panda, "Ming," died several years ago. London residents have been calling all day to inquire when "Union" will be on public display. Dr. Van Force, director of the zoo, said yesterday that he would first host members of the Zoological Society this morning, and then open it to the public in the afternoon. Despite the long journey, "Union" is in good spirits and very lively. Outside the iron fence where "Union" lives, there are three bundles of bamboo shoots, a pile of vegetables of various colors, and a bowl of oatmeal, which is "Union's" food. Her room is equipped with a tree trunk with three branches for her to climb, as well as a sunbathing platform and a small bathtub. "Union" was chewing bamboo shoots when she arrived at the station, looking very relaxed. It is reported that the Chinese government has agreed to find a mate for "Union" soon.</p>

According to the US military, this was the largest military parade by the US military in Japan ever. Eisenhower first stood on the command platform to review, then stepped into an armored vehicle to conduct a rapid mobile review to the sound of music, and then returned to the command platform to stand at attention as 3,000 infantrymen and 100 tanks marched past him. Above, six airplanes soared in formation in the cloudy sky. After the ceremony, Eisenhower accompanied US Eighth Army Commander Eichelberger to the suburbs to review the troops stationed there.</p>
<h3>Japanese Important War Criminals; Resist Court Authority</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] The Far East International Military Tribunal adjourned after hearing the pleas of Japanese war criminals Hideki Tojo and 26 others on Monday last week and set June 3 as the date for the trial. The defendants will begin a legal battle tomorrow to resist the authority of the court. Tojo claimed that he was innocent, not responsible for Japan's aggression, and that the court appointed by MacArthur had no right to consider crimes against peace and humanity. According to the defendants, the Potsdam Declaration stipulates that war criminals who violated international law after the start of the war should be prosecuted, but the charges listed in the indictment include deaths caused by Japan's theft, and they are also accused of group murder.</p>
<h3>Old Dutch Soldier Who Captured Churchill; Unwilling to Meet Churchill</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Amsterdam, 12th] A "New York Times" correspondent said that an old Dutch soldier who participated in the Boer War, Olton Zil, now 79 years old, captured Churchill in 1899. Zil still expresses anti-British sentiment, so he is unwilling to meet with Churchill during Churchill's visit to the Netherlands. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, Olton Zil traveled all over the Netherlands under the banner of the Dutch Nazi faction as "the person who captured Churchill" and also went to Germany to do similar propaganda. His son has been arrested for assisting the secret police.</p>

<h3>Bevin Returns to London for Instructions; Italian Reparations Issue Still Not Agreed Upon by Four Powers; Rumors that US Agrees to Annexation of Saar Region to France</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to London by plane today for instructions and is scheduled to fly back here tomorrow morning to participate in the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov, Byrnes, and others jointly participated in the European Victory Celebration today and were in good harmony. The French Interim President also delivered a speech, praising the contributions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the war and expressing hope that the three powers will continue to strive for peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers held another secret meeting today, lasting two and a half hours, to try to break the deadlock on the reparations issue. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov indicated that if the Four Powers could reach an agreement on the Italian peace treaty issue, he would be willing to set the date for the 21-nation peace conference without waiting for the complete resolution of the Balkan peace treaty issue. The Four Power Foreign Ministers also held a brief discussion on the Balkan and Finnish peace treaty issues at today's meeting. Although the meeting did not produce new results, Molotov indicated for the first time that these peace treaties were secondary issues.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference continued today, but little progress was made because the representatives of each country were waiting for instructions from their respective governments. The meeting also discussed the issue of Italian reparations, but no agreement was reached. Byrnes reportedly spoke in favor of the Soviet Union's demand that Italy pay 100 million lire to the Soviet Union, but this should be offset by the following items: (1) Italian assets overseas, (2) , (3) Two merchant ships, (4) Four Italian warships. In addition, an interpretation was given to the term "war booty." Anything seized by a country can be called war booty. The ships to be given to the Soviet Union can only be regarded as , not war booty, which led to a dispute with Molotov.</p>
<p>(Another Telegram) Information has recently been received from the United States: Washington has decided to agree to the proposal to annex Germany's Saar region to France, but has not yet formally notified the French government. It is generally believed that when the German Saar issue is brought up for discussion, France will suggest that it be resolved together with the German peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Tripoli to Italian Trusteeship; Arab Tribes Strongly Oppose</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tripoli, 12th] The Arab tribes of Tripolitania seem willing to launch a revolution to resist the transfer of the area to Italian trusteeship. The British Military Headquarters in Cairo has reported this situation to London. At the same time, British authorities and Arab leaders have taken preventive measures to prevent violent reactions. After news of the Tripoli issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference reached here, 25 Arab leaders representing all sectors gathered at the British military government here and expressed their determination to sacrifice themselves to fight for the independence of Libya. The president of the Jewish Congress, Hadi Ziz, has also taken a consistent stand with the Arab tribes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 12th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam said yesterday that if Tripoli is handed over to Italian trusteeship, we will not hesitate to fight. We have fought with the Italians for nearly 20 years and will never allow them to return. If the British support the Italians, we will also fight the British. Moreover, dividing Tripoli and Cyrenaica will damage the local economy, and we will never allow it. Arab countries may be placed under UN trusteeship when their strength is not yet sufficient, but we will never allow Italian trusteeship.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 11th] According to reliable official sources, the Egyptian government has submitted a memorandum to the Paris Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference requesting the return of Qirabak to Egypt. Qirabak is located on the border between Egypt and Libya and was ceded to Italy under the 1925 Italian-Egyptian Treaty.</p>
<h3>Details of the Theft of Mussolini's Remains; Miniature Landmines Placed Outside the Tomb Door; Digging Work Lasted One Hour</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Milan, 11th] Details of the theft of Mussolini's remains have recently been obtained by a reporter from the Lombardo Post from one of the thieves. It is said that the thieves originally planned to launch the operation on the night of April 25, but unexpected circumstances forced them to bring forward the execution by two days, because they heard that a certain extremist faction was also planning to do so. They first placed German-made miniature landmines outside the tomb door to prevent police interference. The tomb was difficult to excavate because it had been trampled on, and the soil was hard. It was not until they dug to a depth of five feet that they saw the coffin. At first, they planned to carry it away, but when they opened the coffin and saw that the corpse had not decayed, they decided to wrap it in waterproof cloth and leave. The work took one and a half hours to complete.</p>
<h3>Stalin Received the Most Letters? Truman Received Even More? People from All Corners of the Earth Appeal to the American President for Help - Complaining, Requesting Money, All Sorts of Things</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 11th] It is said that Marshal Stalin received more letters than any other important person in the world, and this news reached the ears of State Department officials, making them somewhat unconvinced. They said that President Truman received the most letters.</p>
<p>Every day, from all corners of the earth, pitiful letters arrive, all stemming from the famine and poverty that occurred after World War II. Almost every letter begins with: "Dear Mr. President..."</p>
<p>"I myself do not ask," wrote a Greek mother, "but my little daughter has a lung disease and is dying. She needs good, clean food and fresh milk to have a chance to live..."</p>
<p>Another letter was sent from fifty-six orphans who used to live in a large house on the banks of the Apennine River in the Italian war zone. Their letter begins: "Glorious Mr. President: Bombs destroyed our home, and now [caretakers] look after us. But we only have one set of tight-fitting clothes, and we need something to cover us at night and more food during the day..."</p>
<p>There was also a letter asking President Truman to find two American military officers who had briefly stayed and played with the orphans and given them military rations and three military blankets when they were stationed in the Italian peninsula during the campaign.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department officials estimate that they receive about two hundred letters from abroad every day, but in one month this year, the total number of letters received reached 11,000.</p>
<p>Every morning, a large group of State Department officials gathers mail written in their specialized languages, engages in translation work, and formulates appropriate responses.</p>
<p>"Dear Uncle Truman," wrote a six-year-old Hungarian girl, "I am very sick. My ears have been inflamed for six weeks, and my head has been severely injured. Many children in America have relatives and receive gifts, but I have no relatives, only you—dear Uncle Truman. Please give me some gifts, and I will be very happy..."</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman also received many letters.</p>
<p>A Dutch father wrote, "Until now, we have not received a shoe ration coupon." He didn't know how he could get "walking shoes" for his two little girls, "Olga and Loscong." He enclosed a photo of the children and wrote, "We feel a bit uncomfortable receiving these things as gifts. We can't pay foreigners yet, but could you be their 'aunt' and send them some shoes, and we will repay you in the future?"</p>
<p>Some letters, at least because of the distance across the ocean to Europe, seem quite amusing from here.</p>
<p>Other letters were sent from a group of young girls asking for a group of Hollywood movie stars to be sent to their city "to give speeches and tell us about Hollywood life."</p>

<p>[United Press Washington, 12th] The Inter-American Defense Board, formed by military representatives of 21 Western Hemisphere countries during the war, has formulated the Inter-American Defense Plan.

<h3>Rescuing the Industrial Crisis; Preparing to Convene a Production Conference; Wages Increase, Imported Goods Flood the Market; Enamel and Leather Industries Also Headed for Complete Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>The city's industrial sector is facing a crisis, with factories requesting layoffs and wage cuts one after another. The textile and silk garment industries are particularly severe. Recently, the trade association requested permission from the Social Affairs Bureau to reduce employees. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian specifically requested the municipal government to convene a production expansion conference as soon as possible to promote production and rescue unemployment. This proposal has been approved by the Municipal Government's Municipal Affairs Conference and is being prepared immediately. It is understood that participants will include representatives from the Executive Yuan's Shanghai-based agencies, the Resources Committee, China Textile and China Silk companies, the Bankers' Association, the Chamber of Commerce, labor unions, and farmers' associations.</p>
<p>According to enamelware manufacturers, during the occupation period, the main raw material (iron sheet) of the enamelware industry was requisitioned by the puppet regime under the pretext of recruiting scrap iron. The entire enamelware industry was forced to a standstill. As a result, countless businesses went bankrupt, resulting in significant losses. After the victory, it was initially planned to resume work immediately, but due to the unstable domestic political situation, traffic obstruction, unsmooth raw material sources, weak capital of various factories, and turbulent labor unrest, the enamelware industry still has no production to speak of. Since the opening of foreign exchange, foreign goods have poured in, and domestic enamelware has been severely hit. If this continues, the enamelware industry will inevitably head for complete bankruptcy, and there will be no place to gain a foothold in the export market. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities can provide support to save the enamelware industry from its demise.</p>
<p>According to a leading figure in the city's leather industry, since the victory until January of this year, business was particularly prosperous due to lower market prices. However, most of the purchases were made by Allied personnel, so from March 1 of this year, all workers demanded a wage increase. After the labor unrest was resolved, prices rose repeatedly, wages increased, and costs increased. Allied personnel were also transferred back to their countries, purchasing power gradually weakened, and business plummeted. Leather goods shipped from Bengbu, Wenzhou, Nanjing, and other places were priced only equal to the cost of labor in Shanghai, so merchants were happy to ship them to Shanghai for sale, and even more orders were placed to South America, Argentina, Uruguay, and other places because their costs were low. If transportation improves this autumn, the market will be filled with foreign goods, and the leather workers in this city will all be unemployed due to lack of work. In addition, before the war, many of the city's leather shoes and other products were shipped to Southeast Asia, but currently, due to excessively high costs, they cannot be shipped. The trade association is actively organizing a guild to concentrate its strength to cope with the crisis ahead.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Headquarters Relocates</h3>

The U.S. military headquarters, which previously operated in the Construction Building, was completely moved out on the previous two nights. The U.S. military headquarters moved to the Hallidie Building, and Generals Gillen and Metas also moved to the building to work. On the previous two nights, U.S. troops braved the rain to move boxes and chairs overnight, and the work was completed at 5 a.m.</p>

<h3>Pilot Management Committee Sets Up Two Offices</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Pilots are very important for guiding ships into and out of ports. Even Yangtze River vessels require pilots to navigate. The city currently has two districts: 1. The Shanghai-Woosong District: Foreign ships coming to Shanghai must wait for pilots to board the ship at Tongsha to navigate into the port, and pilots must also guide them out to the mouth of the Wusong River. 2. The Shanghai-Hankou District: The Yangtze River route between Shanghai and Hankou. In addition to the captain, each vessel must hire a pilot familiar with the Yangtze River waterway. Therefore, the pilots are very important for the navigation of ships, and their skills are no less than those of the captain. Before China regained its navigation rights, the piloting (that is, pilotage) rights in the Shanghai-Woosong District were also seized by foreigners. Since the victory against Japan, various countries have abandoned their navigation rights, and pilotage rights have also been recovered. There are approximately 300 pilots in the city, of whom those from Zhejiang are the most, those from Hubei are the second most, and those from Guangdong are the least. The Ministry of Communications attaches importance to the Pilot Management Committee and has set up offices in various ports for nearby management. The Shanghai-Hankou District Pilot Office is located at A9 Bund, with the Shanghai-Woosong District Pilot Office attached. Qin Zhuru, director of the Shanghai-Hankou District, has arrived to take office. The Shanghai-Hankou District Pilot Association, organized by pilots, has also been established, with Feng Qianzhen as chairman, Wang Mingguang as director of the General Affairs Section, Wang Ander as deputy director, Neng Zhangfu as director of the Business Section, and Zhang Chunfa as deputy director. Most of the companies have hired permanent pilots, so there is a great shortage of temporary pilots, and the association is adjusting this situation.</p>

<h3>Director-General of UNRRA China Region, Kiser, Suddenly Resigns; The Reason is Opposition to Changing the Mission of UNRRA in China Region</h3>
<p>General Rooks, personal representative of UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia, announced yesterday that Kiser, Director-General of UNRRA China Region, has resigned from his post. The reason for his resignation is opposition to the proposal to change the mission of the China Region. Another report: The Director-General of UNRRA China Region, in a statement upon his resignation, said: "General Rooks, personal representative of UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia, has completed the recent consultations with me (Director-General Kiser of the China Region). General Rooks, in view of the current changes in the situation, believes that the policies and work procedures of the China Region should also be changed accordingly, so he conducted this consultation with me. Because I disagree with Mr. Rooks's proposed changes in policies and work procedures, I have submitted my resignation. The Director-General has now appointed Mr. Ray to temporarily assume my duties until a successor is determined. The Director-General has also asked me to continue working in the China Region for a short period of two or three months, serving as a consultant, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the work of various departments of this branch. I am very interested in UNRRA's China program, so I have expressed my agreement, and my personal wish to return to the United States immediately will also be temporarily suspended. We had previously considered the issue of transferring Colonel Olmsted, director of the headquarters group of this region, to the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, because his talent and experience can be fully utilized at the "Relief Administration." At the same time, this change was originally proposed by Messrs. Jie and Li of the Relief Administration and approved by President Song. Colonel Olmsted has now been transferred to the "Relief Administration." He will cooperate with Liu Hongsheng, director of the working group of the Relief Administration, to help him complete the arduous task of building railways, waterways, and highways, and accelerate the implementation of the Chinese government's relief plan."</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Disputes Unresolved: Western-Style Clothing Stores Continue to Be Vandalized; Police Headquarters Urges Both Sides Not to Overstep Boundaries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the labor-management dispute in the Western-style clothing industry in this city, the labor side, due to the management's procrastination in negotiations, has aroused the indignation of some workers. They have been posting slogans on the streets for days, causing conflicts with the management, resulting in the vandalism of some stores in recent days. The victims include Peiluomeng, Yuchangxiang, Royal, and Wang Rongkang on Nanjing Road; Taixing and Xinhua on Daxin Street; and Tianxiang, Xingxing, and Jingxing on Linsen West Road. Among them, Peiluomeng suffered the most damage, with customers' custom-made new clothes being splashed with ink, making them difficult to clean, resulting in losses exceeding ten million yuan. At Xingxing, four people were injured during the conflict. At that time, several dozen workers who caused the trouble were arrested by the police substations in various districts.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the workers' union, in order to prevent the situation from escalating further, sent representatives to visit the trade association to negotiate, but without results. It was also reported that Yuchangxiang on Nanjing Road, Wuxingchang, Yongxing, and several other stores on Chengze Road were vandalized. After the incident, the bureau sent personnel to the scene to suppress the situation, but the workers who caused the trouble had already fled.</p>
<p>Police Sent to Suppress the Scene</p>
<p>Tracing the cause of this incident, the workers' basic wages have been negotiated and resolved. The crux of the matter lies solely in the issue of rice subsidies. The prolonged negotiations have led to this situation. Now, the labor union has stated that it will do its best to prevent conflicts and avoid escalating the unrest, and is seeking solutions. At the same time, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters believes that the workers' actions are overstepping the bounds, causing repeated incidents, and severely affecting social order. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, they have advised both sides to agree on: (1) The arrested workers will be released through negotiations by the Garrison Headquarters; (2) Both sides will continue negotiations, setting a final deadline of 6:00 PM on the 14th; (3) During the negotiation period, workers must not engage in any further incidents that overstep the bounds. Therefore, the outcome of the incident will depend on the negotiations in the next two days.</p>
<p>Tram Workers Continue Mediation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The labor-management dispute at the British Electric Company will continue with negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau at 9:30 AM today. During the negotiations on the 11th, only the issues of sick leave and retirement were resolved. The sick leave arrangement is that workers who are hospitalized will receive full wages, and medical expenses will be borne by the company, but only for six weeks. Beyond this period, with a doctor's certificate, it can be continued. As for those who are sick and not hospitalized, full wages will be paid, but the company will not be responsible for medical expenses. Regarding injuries sustained on duty, the arrangements will be handled in accordance with the agreement of the Electric Power Company. The retirement benefits require a minimum of fifteen years of service to be eligible.</p>
<p>Today's discussion will focus on increasing basic wages and the reinstatement of over two hundred unemployed workers. Among them, the latter is the most difficult issue for both sides to reach an agreement on. The workers insist that the first batch must reinstate one hundred workers, but the company believes that there is currently no need for so many, and will only reinstate six workers for each additional tram car. This stalemate remains to be resolved in the coming days.</p>
<p>Regarding the workers' request to retroactively pay bonuses from 1941, a responsible person from the Social Affairs Bureau stated that this is not legally justified and is similar to increasing basic wages, so they intend not to accept this request.</p>

<h3>Collecting Evidence of Enemy Crimes in War Zones; Hoping the Public Will Actively Report; The War Crime Investigation Team Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday with Relevant Agencies in This City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The War Crime Investigation Team, jointly formed by the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan, led by Team Leader General Chai Zishang, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 10th. From the next day, they began their work, visiting the military court, war criminal detention center, port headquarters, garrison headquarters, city government, and local court in this city. Yesterday morning, they convened relevant agencies at the Garrison Headquarters to hold a joint meeting to discuss the investigation procedures. Those present included Liu Shifang, President of the Military Court of the Third Front Army; Military Judge Lin Wopeng; General Xie Haoling, Commander of the Shanghai Port Transport Command; and General Long Zuoliang; Tan Yulin, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters; Wu Hanchao, Director of the Staff Office; Song Siyi, Director of the Shanghai Command Post of the Jinghu Garrison Command; Jiang Gongliang, Director of the War Criminal Detention Center; Huang Liang, Chief Prosecutor of the Local Court; Yang Zhuoying, Secretary of the City Government; Chief of Justice Jiang Wenhe of the War Prisoner Office; Section Chief Zhu Zonghai of the Police Bureau; Wang Yanyun of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police; and members of the investigation team Ma Zhizhen, Deng Liangshi, Tang Biaomin, Yang Jueyong, and Claude Han, Prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal.</p>
<p>Discussed Procedures and Raised Various Inquiries</p>
<p>First, Ma Zhizhen reported on our country's procedures for handling war criminals, followed by reports from representatives of various agencies on the circumstances of their handling of war criminals. Liu Shifang raised inquiries stating that the military court faced the following difficulties in handling war criminals: (1) The central government has not clearly defined the standards for sentencing, which makes it difficult to make judgments; (2) The military court has only twenty personnel, but the number of cases to be tried is too large, resulting in insufficient manpower; (3) The facts of the crimes listed in the war criminal lists submitted by various parties are too simple to be used as the basis for prosecution. He also said that the methods for handling war criminals are not unified throughout the country, and suggested convening a national meeting on handling war criminals to seek a unified approach. Later, Military Judge Tang Biaomin of the Military and Political Department gave separate replies, and said that according to the procedures for handling war criminals, only those who are reviewed and included in the war criminal list by the central government can be arrested. However, according to Article 4 of the War Criminal Handling Regulations, local military authorities can exercise the power of emergency arrest based on people's accusations that have been verified. Later, representatives of various agencies asked questions to Claude Han, the representative of the Far East International Tribunal, and made suggestions to the central government, requesting the investigation team to relay them. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. The team is scheduled to fly to Hankou this morning to investigate war crimes, and will also fly to Fuzhou, Taiwan, Guangzhou, Guilin, Hengyang, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, Xuzhou, Nanjing, and other places to try the twenty-eight major Japanese war criminals and punish them with the crimes they deserve.</p>
<p>Departing for Investigations in Various Districts, Expected to Last Only One Month</p>
<p>In order to clarify its work and mission to all sectors, the team hosted a tea party for the local press at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday. During the meeting, Commissioner Yang Jueyong, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported that the work of repatriating Japanese prisoners and residents is nearing completion, but the work of arresting and trying war criminals is not yet satisfactory and needs to be strengthened in the future. At the same time, the Allied Headquarters, because our country has been fighting the war for the longest time, eight years, and the people have suffered the most, sent three prosecutors and one secretary from the International Tribunal at the end of March to assist our country in organizing the war crime evidence investigation team, which was established on April 9. The team's mission is to supervise the handling of war criminals in various places, direct the search for evidence of crimes, and conduct on-site interviews to gather facts about the enemy's atrocities in various battlefields. However, the scheduled date is only one month, and the work may not achieve the ideal perfection. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the press will provide more assistance and arouse public attention to report as much as possible.</p>
<p>We Have the Right to Demand the Extradition of War Criminals Related to Us</p>
<p>Subsequently, Commissioner Ma Zhizhen, the representative of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, reported that the local court in this city has received a total of 30,600 cases of enemy atrocity registration from November last year to April this year, and the total number nationwide is about 140,000 cases. However, most of the informants failed to provide the names of the war criminals, making investigation difficult. The military court of the First Pacification Zone Command in this city has therefore been unable to conduct smooth investigations. Finally, Military Judge Tang Biaomin, the representative of the Military and Political Department, and Staff Officer Deng Liangshi, the representative of the General Headquarters of the Army, made reports successively and answered questions from reporters. Finally, Commissioner Yang, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, supplemented the following points: (1) The handling of war criminals is based on the provisions of international law and the laws of war, and is not of a retaliatory nature, so everything is based on facts; (2) We have the right to demand the extradition of any war criminals directly related to our country, regardless of their location; (3) The procedure for handling war criminals is initially investigation, then nomination and reporting, after review and confirmation, the translation is sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the London War Crimes Commission and the Far East Branch for record, and then the Military Affairs Commission orders the arrest and prosecution for trial, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30.</p>

<h3>"Liberated Zone" of Northern Jiangsu Hopes for Government Relief, Residents Displaced and Fleeing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Jiangbei Sojourners' Service Society in Shanghai told a reporter: Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in the "liberated zone" of Northern Jiangsu, there are still 20 million people trapped in a dark hell, struggling daily between life and death. Currently, tens of thousands of male and female refugees are flocking to the Yangtai Highway and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, supporting the old and carrying the young, a truly tragic sight. According to reliable surveys, the number of Jiangbei refugees gathered in Shanghai has already exceeded 30,000, mostly from areas such as Jiancheng, Funing, Dongtai, and Xinghua. In their hometowns, a "three-all" policy is being implemented: "all able-bodied men are conscripted," "all food is plundered," and "all intellectuals are killed." No one is safe from the jaws of the tiger. Here is a brief account of the actual situation:</p>
<p>Liberation Situation</p>
<p>Since the Communist Party captured Huangqiao in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), they began to invade the Northern Jiangsu region, using the name of resistance against Japan to plunder food, expand their territory, and appoint Communist county magistrates in various places, forcibly conscripting "militia." After Japan's surrender, the Communist army, the "New Fourth Army," seized cities with military force and weaponry, capturing a large number of enemy weapons and officially declaring the area a "liberated" zone. The first step was to implement a "cleansing" policy, searching for traitors and so-called "Nationalist spies." Anyone with a little capital, knowledge, or reputation was arbitrarily slandered, severely punished, or had their property confiscated to replenish military funds. Furthermore, they enticed local thugs and hooligans to organize "militia backbone units," called "military participants," and ordered other civilians to farm the land and comfort the families of the "military participants." In addition, they organized "peasant associations" to implement "25% rent reduction" and "women's associations" to implement "dedication movements." The 25% rent reduction they implemented had to be calculated from the 26th year of the Republic (1937), forcing landlords to retroactively pay rent. Those unable to pay had no choice but to sell their land and property to barely cope. In terms of currency, the "New Fourth Army" established the "Huainan Bank" in Northern Jiangsu, wantonly issuing "resistance currency." The "resistance currency" was divided into "new resistance" and "old resistance" notes, and the value was extremely chaotic. Furthermore, the area of circulation was limited, and civilians were unable to distinguish between them, causing immense suffering.</p>
<p>Youth Exodus</p>
<p>In the liberated zone, young men and women not only lacked freedom of speech, thought, publication, assembly, and association, but also lost freedom of residence and movement. Those who previously leaned towards Marxism have now awakened and seen through the foreign trickery, and are forced to flee to areas such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. Because they have no travel expenses and no companions, their journey is extremely difficult. Now, around Nanjing and Shanghai, there are nearly 200,000 of them, often unemployed and without schooling, enduring constant suffering. For example, this semester, Jiangzhong Middle School only recruited 100 new students, but over 1800 applied. The large number of young people without schooling is evident. Recently, Northern Jiangsu is again forcibly conscripting men, with eight men conscripted from each household. It is expected that an even larger number of young people will flee.</p>
<p>Hope for Understanding</p>
<p>Before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the entire population of Northern Jiangsu lingered under the iron heels of the invaders, barely surviving and enduring the suffering of human hell. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Communist Party took advantage of the situation to invade, seize cities, and plunder territory, wantonly ravaging the area, truly giving people a sense of being unable to laugh or cry. The general populace believes: (1) Since the Communist Party claims to be a political party, it should cherish the people and not manipulate them for political struggles, and should not implement communism through "terrorist policies." (2) Northern Jiangsu is close to the capital, yet there is a difference between heaven and hell between Jiangnan and Jiangbei. How can the government bear to ignore these hundreds of thousands of people? How can the Communist leaders turn a deaf ear and allow their subordinates to commit such atrocities? The only hope at present is that the Nationalists and Communists can reach an understanding, and that the government will send Nationalist troops to Northern Jiangsu to take over and relieve the people from their suffering. At the same time, we hope that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will quickly allocate a large amount of relief funds and transport them to Northern Jiangsu, so that the general populace can rebuild their lives.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Province Increases Funding for Sending Students Abroad</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanchang] Jiangxi Province established a study abroad fund. In previous years, 15 million yuan was allocated from the surplus of Yumin Bank. By the end of last year, the interest earned was only over 3.61 million yuan. This meager amount is far from sufficient to cover study abroad expenses, making it necessary to increase the fund. This year, the province plans to send approximately five or six students abroad, so the fund must be at least 10 million yuan. In addition to the original fund of 15 million yuan, an additional 8.5 million yuan must be raised. The authorities have drafted fundraising methods: Yumin Bank will allocate another 10 million yuan, Construction Bank will allocate 5 million yuan, Xingye Company will allocate 10 million yuan, and the remaining 60 million yuan will be allocated from the province's own funds.</p>

<h3>Students of Zhejiang Medical and Pharmaceutical College Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Demanding Prompt Payment of Overdue Public Funds</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College moved to Eastern Zhejiang during the War of Resistance and re-established in Linhai. All books, instruments, and practical training equipment were preserved intact. This time, the relocation funds received were only 4.2 million yuan, which barely covers transportation costs. Moreover, the original campus in Hangzhou was completely destroyed during the enemy occupation and is difficult to restore. Therefore, classes can only continue to be held in Linhai. The school also experiences delays in the disbursement of funds from the Ministry, sometimes going half a year between disbursements. However, rice prices in that area are the same as elsewhere and are increasing daily, resulting in significant losses. The public funds for publicly funded students have not been received since December. The students are extremely anxious. Therefore, the school's student union has sent representatives, including Wu Weiyou, to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Education directly, demanding the prompt payment of overdue public funds and requesting that future disbursements be made in advance. They also requested an increase in relocation and reconstruction funds. The representatives passed through Hangzhou on the 10th, asked Director Xu of the Department of Education for instructions and assistance, and took a car to Shanghai on the 11th to transfer to Nanjing.

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Society for Life Education Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Social Bureau Sent Personnel to Provide Guidance</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai branch of the Society for Life Education held its inaugural meeting yesterday (12th) at 2 p.m. at the Xin Zha Road Elementary School in the city. More than 200 people attended, including Tao Xingzhi, Huang Yanpei, Xu Xiaotian, Ma Xulun, Ni Wenzhou, Guo Moruo, Chen Yisheng, Chen Heqin, Zhou Jianren, Zhang Yiqu, Shi Jianqiao, Ge Yihong, Li Chucai, Tian Han, Yu Zhijie, Shi Dongshan, and Wang Shaojun. The Social Bureau sent personnel to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Chen Heqin Speaks</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Heqin gave an opening speech, briefly describing the movement of life education. The movement began in the eighth year of the Republic (1919). At that time, Mr. Tao Xingzhi gave a definition: life education is the education of life, using life to educate, and education for the needs of life. Mr. Tao personally translated the definition of life education into English in the manner of President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: Life education means an education of life by life and for life. This was conceived and became an organized movement when Xiaozhuang School was established in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927). The first movement of life education was the rural education movement, which aimed to train one million rural teachers as the center of rural reconstruction and farmer service. After the January 28th Incident, the "big classroom, little teacher" system proved effective and was promoted throughout the country, beginning the popular education movement. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when Japan invaded North China and the national crisis became more urgent, the national crisis education movement was launched to awaken the masses with the power of mass education to jointly solve the national crisis. After Japan surrendered, we entered the era of the democratic education movement. We must popularize democratic education throughout the nation and jointly create a democratic China. He then introduced Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, Shi Jianqiao, Tian Han and others to speak.</p>
<p>Tao Xingzhi Speaks</p>
<p>Next, founder Tao Xingzhi delivered a speech, expressing his admiration for Huang Yanpei, Shi Jianqiao and others who have dedicated themselves to education. Guo Moruo advocated that "life education" should be changed to "life learning," and Tian Han advocated that the "life" in "life education" should be "democratic life," which he felt was particularly adapted to the times and expressed his acceptance. Finally, he encouraged everyone with three words: "humility," to humbly obey the people, "learning," to learn what others have not yet, and "contribution," to contribute to culture for the public good, for the benefit of all. According to the report issued by the society, the society aims to explore and promote the most reasonable and effective new education principles and methods, and to promote "the enlightenment of self-awareness, the cultivation of creativity, the popularization of education, and the improvement of life." There are currently more than 2,000 members, scattered throughout the country. The headquarters is in Chongqing and will soon be relocated to the capital. The society has recently formulated a one-year plan as follows: (1) Mobilize members across the country to promote the popular education movement in their local areas. Hold two popular education research meetings; (3) Hold twelve popular education and education lectures; (4) Establish ten popular education experimental zones in key locations across the country; (5) Contract 500 schools scattered across the country to pilot the small teacher popular education system; (6) Publish 20,000 copies of the popular education bi-monthly, with 10 copies available in each of the 2,000 counties; (7) Publish 1 million copies of the "Common Words for All Ages" textbook, totaling 4 million volumes; (8) Publish 100,000 copies of the "Common People's Library," with 100 copies in each, totaling 10 million volumes; (9) Publish 10,000 to 100,000 copies of the "Common People's Daily"; (10) Publish 100,000 copies of the "Small Teacher's Guide"; (12) Publish 100,000 copies of the "Biography of Mr. Wu Xun"; (12) Compile a set of songs for Wu Xun's education; (10) (3) Compile a Wu Xun dance book; (14) Compile a Wu Xun play; (15) Compile a Wu Xun film; (16) Organize ten Wu Xun song and dance teams. Then, all members passed the charter of the society and elected 25 directors and 9 supervisors, until around 6 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Director Ying of the Beiping Education Bureau Visits Nanjing Again to Discuss Education Funds</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Agrees to Forward Request to the Executive Yuan for Relief</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] Director Ying Qianli of the Beiping Education Bureau visited Nanjing again because of the shortage of education funds in Beiping, which made it impossible to increase the salaries of school teachers and staff, resulting in a strike in the education sector.

Principals and teachers of all central national schools will receive living allowances and public grain in accordance with the standards for county-level civil servants. Principals and teachers of all national schools should also receive living allowances and public grain in accordance with the standards for county-level civil servants in rural central national schools. However, if the living allowance and public grain are insufficient, the living allowance for Year 35 must not be less than half of that of county-level civil servants. The public grain will be temporarily provided by the rural towns and villages according to age, with monthly quotas of 2 *shi* of study grain, or 1 *shi* and 6 *dou*, or 1 *shi* and 2 *dou*. In accordance with central regulations, the above-mentioned monthly salaries, living allowances, and public grain should all be included in the county's total budget for expenditure. The regulations on preferential treatment for primary school teachers should be earnestly implemented so that they can serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Intensify Research and Guidance</p>
<p>The Provincial and various Normal Guidance Area National Education Research Associations should intensify research and guidance work, and universally establish county, city, township, and town education research associations. The original Educational Work Teams in the recovered areas will be renamed National Education Demonstration Areas, located in the ten counties of Nanchang, Xinjian, Jiujiang, Xingzi, Hukou, Pengze, Anyi, Yongxiu, Ruichang, and Dean, to promote the advancement of national education.</p>
<p>Broadly Raise National Education Funds</p>
<p>In Year 35, the regulations stipulate that the recurrent expenditure for each central national school should be at least 37,860 yuan, and the recurrent expenditure for each national school should be at least 14,300 yuan. Temporary expenditures should also be included in the county's total budget to ensure realistic figures. According to reports from 45 counties including Nanchang, a total of 7,060,690,645 yuan has been raised for the national education fund. Counties that have not reported or have not raised the full amount will be ordered to report and raise the full amount. A national education fund grain donation campaign will also be launched, with 200 *shi* per school, and the public school properties will continue to be investigated and used to the greatest extent possible to supplement national education funds.</p>
<p>(B) Secondary Education</p>
<p>The general principles of secondary education in this province are to rectify the academic atmosphere and improve standards. Provincial middle schools should strive to enrich their content and rectify their academic atmosphere to set an example for local middle schools. County middle schools must ensure stable funding and sound teaching staff to serve as the cultural center of the county. Private middle schools will be strictly supervised, and the standards for establishment will be raised to prevent indulgence, so that both public and private middle schools can cultivate outstanding talents for advanced studies and pillars of society to fulfill their mission. Based on the above principles, the important facilities for secondary education this year are as follows:</p>
<p>Divide into Nine Middle School Districts</p>
<p>(1) "Adjust Middle School Districts": In order to closely integrate politics and education, the province is divided into nine middle school districts according to administrative regions, and all public and private middle schools in the province are evenly distributed within each district to promote the balanced development of secondary education in various regions. (2) "Establish Additional Provincial Middle Schools": This year, the middle school class of the Provincial Yichun Normal School will be separated to establish the Provincial Yichun Middle School, and the Ningdu County Middle School will be reorganized into the Provincial Ningdu Middle School to realize the plan of having at least one provincial middle school in each administrative region. (3) "Raise Funds to Build School Buildings and Enrich Equipment": Since the Anti-Japanese War, schools have undergone relocation, and the original school buildings and equipment have been damaged. In addition to continuing to petition the central government for post-war rehabilitation funds, we will also lead the school building movement to seek self-reliance and regeneration. The school buildings of various county middle schools mostly borrow public houses or rent private houses, and the equipment is mostly simple. We should urge them to quickly repair and strive to enrich them. (To be continued) The association invited more than 300 teachers from various schools. Later, due to rain, the director and guests did not attend. The representative Cao Guochen delivered a speech, and then a movie was shown to add to the fun. No ceremony was held. It is also heard that 50% of the donations will be presented to the teachers of various private schools by the association itself.</p>

<h3>China Race Walking Association Actively Prepares to Resume</h3>
<p>The China Race Walking Association is the only race walking group in this city. It has a long history. Starting in the winter of 1931, under the leadership of Cheng Yize, Shi Youhui, and Lu Yutian (deceased), it organized five public Chinese race walking competitions in Shanghai. The enthusiasm of the participants and the fervor of the audience are still vivid in people's minds. Due to the war, the members were scattered, and the association's affairs were suspended for many years. When the Shanghai International Race Walking Competition was held, the association won the championship for six consecutive years, opening up the glory of our country in the international race walking arena. At the 1936 World Games held in Germany, the association selected Zhou Yuyu, Cai Zhengyi, Zhang Zaojiu, Zheng Chengshan, and others to attend the competition, and the results were satisfactory. Now, the original committee members of the China Association, Zhang Zaojiu, Zhou Yuyu, Xu Aichen, Lu Wenxia, and others, are reiterating the previous proposal and intend to rise again.

<h3>Gold Market Rebounded Last Week, Rice Price Problem Serious, Public Bonds Active, Stocks Weak</h3>
<p>The financial market was relatively stable at the beginning of last week. Gold hovered for quite a long time. On Saturday, due to enthusiastic buyers from other ports, the price suddenly rose. Chinese and foreign stocks experienced many twists and turns in the middle, and ultimately reported softening compared to the previous week. The overall price fluctuations were tight. Foreign currencies followed gold's movements. However, rice prices rose sharply. The top white rice has broken the 50,000 mark, and the trend is quite serious. The relevant authorities are currently striving to remedy the situation, but the effect is yet unknown. The details of each industry are recorded below.</p>
<p>Gold: Under the control of the Bank of China at the beginning of the week, the trend was sluggish, hovering around the 1.6 million mark. On Saturday, a surge occurred due to the return of buyers from other ports. The black market rose to 1.73 million. The Bank of China's gold allocation price also increased to 1.67 million. The black market closed at 1.71 million.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: The trend of US dollars is based on the rise and fall of gold. On Monday, due to a slight increase in gold, US dollars saw 2,330 yuan, then retreated to 2,220 yuan. From Monday to Friday, it fluctuated within a small range. On Saturday, due to the rise in gold prices, it saw a sharp rise, reaching a maximum of 2,340 yuan, and finally stood at 2,310 yuan. Hong Kong dollars changed little throughout the week, and the trend was sluggish. The closing price on the weekend was 410 yuan, 20 yuan lower than the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Unified Bonds: The unified public price fluctuated and was uncertain, presenting a situation of sudden rise and fall. Initially, rumors of principal repayment were beneficial, and the market rose sharply. Later, upon hearing of a lottery, the market fell. Among them, double illusions were controlled by speculative giants. Type C rose from 6,400 to over 7,000 yuan on Tuesday, and then fell to 6,700 on Saturday. On Thursday, it was heard that the lottery for principal repayment would be held on the 10th, and confidence was shaken, falling to as low as 6,100 yuan. On Friday, it was heard that the lottery date had passed, and speculators became active again, with Type C rising to 7,300 yuan. On Saturday, some people sold out, and the market was idle, falling to 6,400 at one point, and finally returning to 6,800-6,900 yuan. Types A, B, and D were at 4,700-4,800 in the middle, and Type E saw 5,000 yuan. On Saturday, Types A and B were at 4,200, Type D was at 4,000 yuan, and Type E was at 4,400.</p>
<p>Stocks: Chinese stocks initially showed hesitation at the beginning of the week, then showed a downward trend. The market stabilized slightly at noon, and the results were lower than the previous weekend. On Tuesday, a slight setback was initially reported, then large investors pulled up the market, and the market rose. Mei Ya took the lead in being popular, yarn factories followed suit, and the small three heats were also brought up. On Wednesday, Nongkai was extremely stable, but later, large investors secretly released, and the price could not be sustained. On Thursday, market news was confusing and volatile. Yarn factories and Mei Ya fell to the 54,000 mark. The worst decline among the three small heats was Jingfu, breaking into the 300 yuan mark from 425 yuan. Many unpopular stocks were also soft. On Friday, the process was weak first and then firm, and the hot stocks rose more than yesterday, while the unpopular stocks were mixed. On Saturday, hot stocks fell, and unpopular stocks rose and fell. Foreign stocks were affected by the decline in Chinese stocks at the beginning of the week and were weak, especially the decline in Yi Yarn. On Tuesday, confidence turned prosperous, and all rose, with Yi Yarn and Yinglian rising the most. Small stocks and Huidong were less impressive. On Wednesday, due to small stock bonds, confidence was unsustainable, and prices fell except for Huidong. On Thursday, due to the sharp decline in Chinese stocks, confidence was weak, and the decline continued. On Friday, large stocks improved slightly, and small stocks fell again. On Saturday, except for paper and Asia being flat, the rest showed a downward trend.</p>
<p>Food: At the beginning of the week, the rice market situation was that arrivals were strong, the price of the place of origin fell, and sales were sluggish, all down 1,000-2,000 yuan. Flour was slightly better, up 100-200 yuan. Miscellaneous grains were consistently firm. Oil shops were quite interested in advancing, up about 1,000 yuan. The sugar market was idle, and medium sugar fell slightly by 500 yuan. On Tuesday, rice rose about 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan for Jing rice due to less arrival due to rain, and the promotion of various shops was not weak. Flour turned weak and fell by 300-500 yuan. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans were soft by about 1,000 yuan, raw kernels were slightly popular. Edible oil was congested due to arrival, and the market was flat at first and then weak, with crude oil and soybean oil falling by 4,000-5,000 yuan. The sugar market was mostly sluggish due to tight credit and sluggish sales. On Wednesday, rice, except for Yinyuan and Yangxian, fell by 1,000 yuan due to the higher base the day before, and the rest rose slightly, and the market gradually became normal. Flour continued to decline due to more sales, down 500-600 yuan from yesterday. Soybeans were mixed, raw kernels were stable, and the edible oil market was mediocre, with slight ups and downs. High-end sugar was stable, but other industries were discouraged due to sluggish sales, and the market continued to soften. On Thursday, the arrival of rice was particularly small, and the shops were quite prosperous, continuing to be firm. The flour market was stable, and soybeans and raw kernels both rose in miscellaneous grains. However, Pudong soybean fell slightly by several hundred yuan due to its inferior quality. Edible oil retail sales became active, and the situation was thriving. The sugar was not supported due to the lack of customer sales and the wait-and-see attitude of the industry. On Friday, the price of rice rose sharply due to the small number of arrivals. The largest increase was 5,000 yuan for white you. The flour was also about 10% higher, and the miscellaneous grains had mixed fortunes. The supply of edible oil was less than the demand, and the market was 3,000-4,000 yuan better than yesterday. The sugar was depressed due to the lack of customer sales. On Saturday, the price of rice reached a new high, once approaching the 50,000 yuan mark, and the market rebounded slightly later, but it was still 2,000-3,000 yuan higher than yesterday. Shops were more interested in purchasing flour, and the price rose rapidly by more than 2,000 yuan. Miscellaneous grains and edible oil also launched a rise. Sugar was more stable.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: In the past week, the situation was very mediocre at the beginning of the week. After entering, Tianjin merchants were keen to purchase fine yarn due to the increase in gold. The demand for 20 and 16 yarns from Guangdong and other inland merchants was also not limited. However, the demand for 42 fine yarn was greater than the supply, and the situation was very vigorous. The rise of each of the following 32 yarns was limited. The highest for the entire week was 1.94 million for the 42 yarn at the weekend, and the lowest was 740,000 for the ten yarn double cat. The difference between the highest and lowest was 200,000 per page. In terms of count, the 42 blue was the most, with a surge of 290,000 compared with the previous week. The rest of the yarns only rose by 50,000-60,000 or less.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: During the week, customers’ sales were flat, and there was no change in the market. The situation was completely circling. In the middle, because Fangjian signed a contract with the three major companies to set up a sales office, it caused public anger in the industry, and the market transactions were completely stopped. After the efforts of the association authorities to mediate, the series was resolved on Friday. This week, the situation of grey light twill was popular. It was used for making children's clothing and umbrellas. It rose by 5,500 yuan from the previous week, and the rest of the brands were on the original plate.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: During the week, Fangjian Company purchased the most, and in addition, private yarn mills such as Shenxin No. 1, 2, 5, and 9 and Jiafeng Fuan Dasheng also had considerable needs. The industry was not lonely with each other, and the market price also rose accordingly. As a result, the price of each cotton was about 3,000-5,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Silk and Satin: In the past week, the price of No. 120 Tianqiao silk was quite stable at the beginning of the week, and fell by 50,000 yuan on Wednesday and 80,000 yuan on Thursday. On Friday, the price returned to the original state of Wednesday. No transactions were made in the market on the weekend, and the asking price was similar to that of Friday. During the past week, foreign banks had very few transactions, and Yuanmao and Jardine Matheson entered 78 to 80 points, with prices ranging from 350,000 to 370,000 yuan. The ups and downs of user silk were very small. Compared with the price on Monday and the weekend, it was about 50,000-60,000 higher. The price of Meiya quilt satin was the smallest at 1.05 million yuan and the largest at 1.11 million yuan on Tuesday afternoon. The smallest grid crepe was 3,550 yuan and the largest was about 3,800 yuan.</p>
<p>Other: As for other industries, there were also many fluctuations. The prices of daily necessities such as soap fell more than they rose. The fixed price was 53,000 yuan on Monday and 40,000 yuan on Saturday, a sharp drop of 13,000 yuan for the whole week. The removal of foreign candles was sluggish, and the market was stable. The prices of matches rose and fell suddenly. On average, the prices of oranges and other goods fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan, and sugar fatigue has not ended, with an average of about 5,000 yuan for return shipments.</p>
<h3>Livestock Market Closed, Pig Sties Resume Business</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The pig sties in this city are mostly located in the Xuejia Port and Wusong areas of Nanshi, and there are quite a few of them. All pig vendors transport goods to Shanghai, and they are first put into the sties for sale. The tasks they undertake are: (1) Unloading imported pigs, (2) Tying feet and weighing, (3) Cutting hair to identify the owner of the number, (4) Feeding, (5) Health care. In the event of injury or death, compensation must be paid in accordance with the regulations, (6) Transportation. Because of these conveniences, the passengers are happy to do so. During the enemy and puppet era, they intended to collect money and set up a so-called livestock market, luring the pig sties to join. The pig sties were unwilling to cooperate and all closed down automatically. Now that the market has been ordered to be cancelled by the municipal government, each sty has resumed business and jointly submitted a request to the government for filing.</p>

<h3>Sales of Woolen Fabrics Gradually Narrow</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics have narrowed because the people in various places are hoping to receive the goods. Except for the necessities, they are all waiting for each other. Therefore, people inside and outside the industry are timid, and the road of customer sales and this street is walking narrower, and the business of tailors has become deserted.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Returns to Flat</h3>
<p>The timber market returned to flat after the continued arrival of foreign pine, and the market had a large number of sales, so the market was soft and tired. Now, due to the increase in gold prices, the sellers intend to wait and see and have stopped selling, and the price has stabilized, and various goods have also tended to return to flat.</p>
<h3>Seafood Transactions are Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of seafood groceries has been flat and tired, and the appetite of customers and this street is still rare. The newly arrived goods such as shark fins, sea cucumbers, raw powder, and prayer vegetables have not risen, but the source of water and feet has increased, and the cost has increased, so they cannot fall, and the trend is firm.</p>
<p>Goods such as Xiang-produced mushrooms and kelp slices are rarely available due to the lack of smooth ships, and they are more popular than actual sales, and the prices are rising.</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Independence for the Longan Industry: The Industry Still Advocates Independent Organization</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] There are a total of fifty-four businesses in Shanghai specializing in longans. Their operations involve purchasing longans and shipping them to Shanghai, then reselling them to various ports, or wholesaling to the preserved fruit and sandalwood longan industries. Forty years ago, there was already an organization. After obtaining approval for filing, and after the victory, the governing authority, believing that there should not be more than two organizations within one industry in the same region, ordered a merger with the preserved fruit or sandalwood longan industries. However, the longan industry maintains that due to its different nature, it should remain an independent organization.</p>
<h3>White Tung Oil Weakens Again</h3>
<p>Due to the apparent upward trend of various commodities last week, sentiment for white tung oil was somewhat buoyed, and sales prices at various firms in Shanghai once increased to 72,000 yuan. However, after only a few days, news from Hankou indicated that the market remained sluggish, still only around 51,000 yuan. Although there seemed to be activity on the Zhejiang Railway, it was only a flash in the pan and did not last. Shanghai naturally could not remain isolated, and the selling price fell back to 70,000 yuan. Furthermore, export sales remained elusive. Although there were sporadic transactions, the total, when calculated in foreign exchange, was still forced. The cost of delivery in Shanghai, including the iron drums, was only about 74,000 to 75,000 yuan, which was not very profitable. Recently, domestic sales have also weakened, selling for only 68,000 yuan. If exports are not strong, adjusting prices to facilitate exports is the only hope for development.</p>
<h3>Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Assets: Total Reaches 50 Billion</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has entrusted the Jianghai Customs to publicly auction off a large quantity of silk fabrics, pigments, chemicals, spices, metal goods, etc., that have been taken over and confiscated. The viewing of samples began yesterday at the Customs warehouse office, and the deadline for bidding is tomorrow (the 14th).

It is reported that the bureau disposed of various materials worth 21.6 billion yuan last month and expects to reach 50 billion yuan by the end of this month. Two-thirds of the warehouses cleared out, totaling approximately 1,000, will be cleared by the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Reopening of Commercial Banks: Original Supporting Documents Required</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated supplementary measures for the restoration of commercial banks in the recovered areas, many banks and financial institutions have applied for resumption of business or continued operation in accordance with these measures. However, most of the supporting documents submitted are photocopies. The Ministry of Finance, considering the difficulty of verification, has telegraphed various provinces and cities, requesting that original documents be submitted in the future for review.</p>
<h3>Factions in the Scrap Iron Industry: Each Establishes its Own Trade Association</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The local scrap iron industry is divided into three groups. One group deals in steel bars, scrap iron, etc., specializing in imported steel bars, foreign ingots, foreign squares, foreign plates, etc., mainly used for construction and machinery manufacturing. The second group is the hardware scrap industry, whose goods for sale are scrap hardware materials collected from glass shops, copper shops, and tin shops, and then sold to hardware shops for melting and reprocessing. The third group is the miscellaneous iron industry, whose goods are scrap iron from various factories, sold to iron shops to manufacture agricultural tools. The first two groups have already established their own trade associations. The miscellaneous iron industry was previously initiated by Chen Rongkun, Zhang Luchao, and others, who were fortunately ordered to join the associations of the first two groups.

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Business License Tax</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shangyi</p>
<p>Shanghai's financial difficulties have led to the introduction of a business license tax. The business license tax is a type of control tax, meaning that businesses subject to control must pay the tax to obtain a permit and cannot operate without authorization.</p>
<p>Analyzing the various businesses listed in the tax law as subject to license tax, there are generally two categories:</p>
<p>1. Those belonging to the category of luxury goods.</p>
<p>2. Those belonging to the category of unnecessary consumption or superstitious items.</p>
<p>For those not explicitly listed but subject to control, business license tax may also be levied with the approval of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>However, the so-called "subject to control" has its clear boundaries. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's approval for control must be based on the prerequisite of "subject to control." Otherwise, it would be inconsistent with the original intention of the control tax and would appear to be merely a business registration fee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai business license tax originally included thirty-three categories and was subsequently increased by five categories with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, totaling thirty-eight categories. Whether all of them are "subject to control" is theoretically questionable. For example, if Western medicine can be controlled, then the affiliated medical colleges and medical laboratories would fundamentally have a problem. If the barbering industry can be controlled, then Chinese pharmacies may have to stop selling hair growth medicines. As for the control of the woolen and Western clothing industries, the reasons are even more difficult to explain. As for the photography industry being considered a luxury or unnecessary item, it is unclear why national identity cards still need to use photos.</p>
<p>That orders may not change laws is an inviolable principle of a country ruled by law. Therefore, levying a tax on businesses that should not be controlled, regardless of whether it has been approved, is not entirely legal. Even if "taxes adapted to local conditions are, in principle, permitted to be levied," they "should be submitted by local governments to the local legislative body for approval before being submitted to the central government for approval and implementation" to be legal! Reading Executive Yuan's Instruction No. Jie An Ding Zi 3783 states: "The biggest reason for the current financial difficulties of local autonomy lies in excessive spending, excessive central government mandates, and excessive burdens of military requisition and conscription, making it impossible to cope with legal revenue." It is known that the difficulties of local autonomy have their own underlying causes. If we do not quickly find a fundamental solution and only address superficial issues, seeking more revenue from entertainment taxes, banquet taxes, and business licenses, I fear the effect will be limited, and in the reorganization of the tax system, it will only make matters worse.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Restoration of Qiantang Bridge and Aviation Education: Visiting the Fighters of the Blue Sky</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, December 11 Communication, Zhu Mincheng</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers of the Jianqiao Chinese Aviation Officer School in Hangzhou are returning east from Kunming using various means of transportation. Graduates of the Jianqiao Aviation School established immortal historical records in the past eight years of air combat. In the autumn of 1937, the school moved west and finally established a school in Wujiaba Village, Kunming, to continue training students. In the last three years, due to the difficulty of supplying aircraft gasoline domestically, the school, with the assistance of the United Kingdom and the United States, established a branch school in Lahore, India, for the initial flight training of aviation students. After completing the initial flight training, they were sent to the United States for intermediate and advanced flight training.</p>
<p>Sixty Stearman Aircraft Fly a Long Distance</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Aviation Officer School was ordered to move back to its original site in Jianqiao, Hangzhou, from Kunming and Lahore, India. Recently, the reporter visited the Jianqiao Aviation School and saw that the school was being rebuilt from ruins, with workers busy non-stop. Aircraft were lined up on the green grass airfield. In the officers' quarters, the reporter found Instructor Mao Zhaopin, whom he had met in Liangshan, Sichuan. He was originally the squadron leader of the Third Air Group, fighting over the skies of Henan, Hubei, and Hunan, and had achieved many combat victories. Later, he was injured and transferred to the position of instructor at the Aviation School. Chief Instructor Cao Chaojue told him that this time he flew a Stearman aircraft from Lahore, India, through the Himalayas, Hump, and Savage Mountain, to Kunming and then to Hangzhou. This long-distance flight can be said to be a good example of adventure and difficulty in the history of aviation education. Sixty aircraft participated in this mission. The following is a record of the collective return of the Aviation School's aircraft from abroad, to preserve historical records.</p>
<p>The Stearman aircraft is made in the United States. It is used by the United States as a primary trainer for training pilots. It has two wings, two seats, and low horsepower, with a speed of 85 miles per hour. The fuel capacity allows it to fly for three and a half hours, and when fully fueled, it can fly a range of 300 miles, with an altitude limit of 12,000 feet. Before and for five years after the war, the Chinese Aviation School used Fleet primary trainers. In 1943, the Aviation School implemented aviation education in Lahore, India, and began using Stearman aircraft as trainers.</p>
<p>As a result of three years of use, only 90 or so of the Stearman aircraft remain complete and able to fly. These 90 or so aircraft have each flown more than 700 hours. Some of the aircraft engines are nearing overhaul time (the engine can be used for 2,000 hours, after which it must be overhauled). After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Aviation School was ordered to move back to its original site in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. Before the new trainers arrive from the United States, this batch of half-old trainers must be transported to Hangzhou for teaching purposes. Therefore, the Aviation School authorities decided to have the aircraft flown back to China from Lahore in northwestern India by the school's instructors.</p>
<p>A Hazardous Test Flight: Altitude of 25,000 Feet</p>
<p>The air route from India to China is one of the most difficult in the world. The worst section is the Himalayas, the Hump, and the Savage Mountain in northern Myanmar and western Yunnan. The altitude of these mountains is over 15,000 feet. There are very few airfields between these mountain peaks. After flying out of Tingjiang on the Hump, it is only possible to land at Myitkyina and Bhamo (both in northern Myanmar). If these two airfields cannot be found, then there are only two options: parachute or crash into the mountain. Because the fuel is limited, there is no chance to fly back.</p>
<p>In order for the aviation students returning to China and the students recruited domestically to have aircraft to learn to fly, the Aviation School decided to have all the flyable aircraft flown to Hangzhou by the school's instructors. The instructors are all veteran pilots who have experienced many battles. People known for their skills are unwilling to decline the opportunity to use their skills. Although what is needed this time is not simply flying skills, but also the courage and determination of the instructors to dedicate themselves to this adventurous flight. These young veteran pilots did not hesitate. Although the wreckage of 700 crashed aircraft and the bones of Chinese and American personnel on the Hump and Savage Mountain were haunting their minds, they said: "Once we decide, we will implement it. We will each try our luck."</p>
<p>First Test Flight: Cao Chaojue Describes His Experience</p>
<p>On November 12th last year, Cao Chaojue, along with mechanical sergeant Lü Kangxi, flew a Stearman, and Guo Shousong and Zhu Ruopeng flew another. The two aircraft took off from the Lahore airfield in India, starting this voyage and embarking on an adventurous test flight. Cao Chaojue said:</p>
<p>"Our flight this time was all about luck, because the situation at the stations ahead was unclear, and there was no weather forecast along the way."</p>
<p>We talked about this thrilling information in a room full of wind and rain, as if we were in this flight.</p>
<p>"After leaving Lahore, the first stop along the way was Ambala, the second stop was Delhi, the third stop was Agra, and the fourth stop was Cawnpore. After arriving at Cawnpore, the aircraft of Guo Shousong, who was traveling with me, developed a problem and stopped for repairs. From then on, I flew alone in one aircraft. The fifth stop was Allahabad, the sixth stop was Gaya, and the seventh stop was Bhagalpur. After landing at the Bhagalpur airfield, I found that no one was in charge at all, and there was no fuel to add. Seeing that the wind was blowing towards the next stop, Lalmonirhat, I ate a meal at the home of an Indian doctor nearby and then took off eastward. Fortunately, it was a tailwind. The fuel had not run out when flying to Lalmonirhat. Otherwise, I would have had to make a forced landing in the wilderness. The American troops had withdrawn from the Lalmonirhat airfield. After refueling, I continued to fly. When I arrived at the ninth stop, Tezpur, it was already 9:00 PM. In the Indian weather, 9:00 PM is like dusk in our country and it is still possible to fly. Tezpur is an American military base. I stayed here overnight. By this time, I had been flying for two days.</p>
<p>"On November 14th, I took off and flew to Chabua near Tingjiang. I heard that the American troops at the Myitkyina airfield would withdraw on the 15th. Although it was already 2:00 PM, I decided to fly over the Hump to Myitkyina at the foot of Savage Mountain, so as not to delay until the next day and not be able to refuel the aircraft at Myitkyina. Fortunately, I did not encounter bad weather during this flight. When I arrived over the Myitkyina airfield, I saw several fires below. I knew that the American troops were burning the remaining supplies after the battle. After landing, no one paid attention to me. The American soldiers were hurriedly preparing to go home tomorrow. They were too lazy to care about other people's affairs. I had been flying for a day and it was the third day of flying. Food and lodging could not be solved, so I had to sleep hungry on an empty desk in the office overnight.</p>
<p>"On the 16th, I could not find any aircraft fuel everywhere. I found a car driver who helped me find a barrel of car fuel on the ground. The Stearman aircraft has low horsepower, and car fuel can also be used. After taking off from Myitkyina, I saw a British aircraft that had made a forced landing in the wilderness due to damage, waving a white cloth to ask me to notify the next station to rescue it. I arrived at the Bhamo airfield and immediately informed the people at the station to rescue the British aircraft. However, the tail wheel of my aircraft was damaged. I walked to the American motor depot seven miles away. After negotiating for a while, they sent someone to repair the tail wheel. After it was repaired, I took off.</p>
<p>"Although it was November, it was very hot in Bhamo. I felt even hotter after running back and forth. When I took off, I was only wearing a khaki shirt. I originally planned to land at the Baoshan airfield in Yunnan. After circling over the Baoshan airfield twice, I saw that there was no one below, so I flew straight to Yunnan Yi. From Baoshan to Yunnan Yi, I climbed onto the Yunnan plateau. The weather was cold, and I was shivering from the cold. After landing at the Yunnan Yi airfield, the station chief, who was my classmate, covered me with silk cotton quilt strips and I fell asleep. The time was 4:00 PM. I was really cold and hungry. That night, I had a good meal and slept soundly. On the morning of the 17th, I landed at the Wujiaba airfield, the site of our school. From India to Kunming, the total distance was 2,400 miles. I flew over one station at a time in five days. When I arrived at the Kunming airfield, the American and British troops were very surprised: How could a small yellow grasshopper that China had never seen fly from the sky? They came to ask where I came from. I told them that I had come from the foot of the Hump in India. The British and American officers were all stunned, gave me a thumbs-up, and thought we were risking our lives. If it were the United States, they would rather transport the aircraft by ship or car than risk flying like this."</p>
<p>I was naturally concerned about the Stearman that was being repaired in Cawnpore. It just so happened that squad leader Zhu Ruopeng arrived. He said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Chief Instructor Cao took the mechanic away, making the two of us rush to repair the aircraft ourselves in Cawnpore, and then hurry to catch up station by station. We finally arrived in Kunming safely."</p>
<p>Cao Chaojue and Zhu Ruopeng are both from Guangdong. Eight years ago, the two of them were flying fighter planes in the army and fighting in Jurong, Nanjing. After their two aircraft successfully completed the test flight, they decided on the eastbound flight of a large formation of Stearman aircraft back to China.</p>
<h3>Large Squadron Flies East: Arrives Safely in Kunming from India</h3>
<p>Cao Chaojue had been in Kunming for a week, yet rumors still circulated in Leh, India: "Chief Instructor Cao is missing." It was believed that Chaojue and his small "Grasshoppers" [referring to Stearman aircraft] had perished in the Hump or the Savage Mountain. The obstruction of telegraphic communication was the root of these rumors. After Cao Chaojue returned to Leh with Education Director Liu Muqun, Steadman's success in crossing the Hump gave all pilots confidence. The large squadron's eastward flight began immediately. The first batch, led by Section Chief Tao Weisheng, consisting of twelve Stearman aircraft, took off from Leh, India on December 11th of last year and arrived safely in Kunming on the 17th. Subsequently, they took off from Kunming this year, passing through Luoping, Bose, Liuzhou, Guilin, Hengyang, Hankou, Anqing, and Nanjing, to Hangzhou. This Kunming-Hangzhou route is 1,600 miles long and can be reached in three days. Although Section Chief Tao Weisheng's twelve Stearman aircraft encountered dangers along the way, they relied on their piloting skills and leadership abilities to finally land safely and completely at Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport.</p>
<p>Following this, the second batch of Stearman aircraft, led by Lai Senquan, flew back from India, also with twelve aircraft. The third batch was led by Zou Huanzhang, with twelve aircraft. The fourth batch was led by Zhou Dingyi, also with twelve aircraft. The fifth batch was led by Cao Chaojue, with ten aircraft. In total, sixty aircraft arrived safely in China, with Kunming as their first destination. However, losses were slightly incurred on the journey from Kunming to Hangzhou. Instructor Wang Yinruo crashed into a mountain and perished in Luoping due to weather conditions. On May 7th, this reporter, representing Director Jianpu of the Political Department of the Aviation Committee, visited and consoled this group of flight instructors who had made the long journey back to the country at Jianqiao. First, I saw Miss Shui Jingyan, the fiancée of Instructor Mao Zhaopin, in the instructor's dormitory. Miss Shui can be said to be an aviation enthusiast; she happily introduced the instructors she was familiar with to me. I then met Instructor Li Jingchong and his wife. We were not as formal as people meeting in official circles, and we spoke frankly. Soon, Mao Zhaopin returned from Hangzhou, and he introduced me to Chief Instructor Cao Chaojue, who piloted the first Stearman aircraft back to the country. Chief Cao, a native of Guangdong, smilingly recounted his first flight back to the country. He is short and stout, with missing front teeth. He has been flying for fifteen years since graduating from aviation school and has taught countless aviation students. He has spent half his life in aviation and can be said to be a true patriot. These people, both young and old, are not like the experts in general society who seek high prices for private gain. You can tell from his ruddy complexion that he is intimately acquainted with the sun, wind, rain, and Guanghan Airport. Soon, Instructor Yu Yaoting joined us. He is from Jiangyin, Jiangsu, and flew B-25 bombers in the first squadron, second flight, in operations in Liangshan, Zhijiang, and other places. During the Japanese retreat from Guiliu towards Wuhan, he often took off from Zhijiang to dive-bomb and strafe Japanese troops. Instructor Yu is tall; heavy bomber pilots are often of this stature, related to the cockpit seat. Jiang Hanyin was a valiant general of the fifth squadron. He also talked about a time he made a forced landing in Dongxingyuan, Yuanjiang, Hunan, and then about his last mission, an attack on a Japanese airfield in Hengyang, where they collectively shot down seventeen enemy aircraft. Finally, the reporter also saw Squad Leader Zhu Ruopeng, the pilot of the second single-engine Stearman aircraft to test-fly back to the country. A native of Guangdong, tall in stature. As I was leaving, I also met Instructor Yao Quanli. I hadn't seen him in seven years; his hair was already balding, but he was still as energetic as ever. I only know a portion of the list of sixty Stearman aircraft pilots, including Hou Chen, Liu Muyu, Huang Weiran, Jiang Hanyin, Yao Quanli, Zou Huanzhang, Yang Deguang, Li Guoan, Wu Yougan, Zhang Shuben, Ye Zhao, Wang Longshu, Yu Yaoting, Chen Jiekang, Zhang Yisheng, Zhou Dingyi, Wang Jindu, Liu Zizhong, Shi Tongxin, Liang Huisheng, Gao Shaojie, Zhou Xun, Mou Zhouhai, Zeng Tianpei, Pan Guoying, Yu Jiansheng, Ye Nianyun, Ren Chongdao, Liu Fujie, Zhu Ruopeng, Guo Shousong, Lai Senquan, Li Jingchong, Tao Weisheng, Mao Zhaopin, Cao Chaojue, and the mechanic Lü Kangxi.</p>
<p>The Skies Over Hangzhou's Jianqiao Will Become Active This Month</p>
<p>The instructors worked hard to fly the Stearman training aircraft from India's Leh Airport to Hangzhou's Jianqiao Airport. Except for Instructor Wang Yinruo, who crashed into a mountain along the way, fifty-nine aircraft arrived safely. More than fifty can currently be used. The Aviation School's primary training equipment will not be a problem until the new American shipments arrive. Although the buildings at Jianqiao Aviation School are being repaired, the airport is complete, and fuel supplies are not a problem. Aviation students have also arrived in Jianqiao by plane from Leh, India. Therefore, from May 15th, educational flights, which had been interrupted for eight years, will resume in the skies over Hangzhou's Jianqiao.</p>
<p>A New Spirit in the Air Force: Determination and Action</p>
<p>The first phase of Jianqiao before the war cultivated air force cadres for the eight-year War of Resistance. Many young men died in aerial combat or in enemy territory, and many were injured or disabled. Most of them became the backbone of the air force in various units. Although the skies and airport of Jianqiao are in a corner of the southeast, their spirit has enveloped the entire country and extended to America in the New World. The second phase of Jianqiao has begun. Signaled by the courageous return flight of sixty Stearman aircraft, the spirit of the Chinese Air Force is: "I have determination, and I can act!"</p>
<h3>The So-Called Liberated Area</h3>
<p>— A Communication from Northern Jiangsu on the 2nd. Ai Pin</p>
<p>When the autumn wind of last August dispersed the smoke of war from heaven and earth, the world was about to present a scene of peace. However, in China, on the map of post-victory China, the smoke of war still lingered in various places. If it is said that they are fighting for "democracy," then they should respect the word "democracy." However, in reality, they are making it impossible for the common people to return home or make a living. Under the slogan of "democracy," the common people seem to be superfluous, as if they deserve to die.</p>
<p>In Northern Jiangsu half a month ago, those who abandoned their homes and fled south were members of the educated class. Now, even the laborers and "poor scholars" most favored by the Communist army are also flocking to the south of the Yangtze River. In Shaobo Town on the Grand Canal line, where the Nationalists and Communists meet, in addition to the countless people traveling by land, there are more than 300 fast boats on the river, specializing in speculative business of transporting refugees. More than a thousand people a day flee from various counties in Northern Jiangsu to Zhenjiang, numerous as crucian carp crossing the river. The reason they painfully abandoned their homes and willingly became refugees is not without cause. Naturally, they are not accustomed to the various "democratic" policies of the "Liberated Area." Let me describe some of the dynamics in the "Liberated Area" of Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>"Loving the People" Slogans Are Pasted All Over the Streets</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, whenever the Communist army captured a city or town, the first step was to issue a public notice to reassure the people. The important wording was that the general public had suffered greatly from the ravages and destruction of the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance, and that their "democratic government" had come specifically to "liberate" them. The second step was to paint slogans, using ingenious artistic fonts, writing on the walls of streets and alleys: "Support Chairman Mao, implement new democracy." "Abolish one-party dictatorship," "The New Fourth Army is fed by the people, the old Central Government wants to eat, the puppet army robs to eat, and the Japanese fight to eat." Regarding slogans punishing traitors, there were: "Big monks [metaphor for "Han traitors"] don't run away, little monks don't slip away, if the monks run away, the temple can't run away!" In the bustling streets, huge paintings were drawn with the words: "How will we live in the future?" Below was a picture of Chairman Chiang's head, indicating that the "Jiang" in "future" was a substitute for the word "Chiang." Then, on the upper corner of the other side, countless New Fourth Army soldiers were drawn waving to the bewildered and helpless people.</p>
<p>Making Every Effort to Punish Traitors</p>
<p>At the same time, propaganda workers were divided into groups to work, on the streets, in the alleys, in every corner. They gathered the nearby coolies and poor people in one place and said deeply moving words with great kindness: "...We are here to liberate you... We know that you had to stop working during this counter-offensive, and of course, the losses of the past few days should be compensated by us," pointing to bags of white rice: "These are specially brought for you, come on..." A group of poor laborers, seeing the grains of rice that could fill their stomachs, could not help but show joy and delight. Then, the propaganda workers also reveled triumphantly. "We have plenty of rice, and we have a large amount of white rice to distribute to you, as long as you can report who in this street or alley has ever been a traitor, has ever done evil..." This was the propaganda about punishing traitors. The method for reporting landlords and capitalists was the same, but the opening line was: "What do you think is the most unfair thing in the world...? It is the inequality between rich and poor, the rich deserve to live, the poor deserve to die..." Using many common facts to arouse the inequality between the rich and the poor, the bud of class struggle grew in the hearts of every poor person. Of course, this was an opportunity for the poor to vent their anger. After they raised their heads, the educated class was squeezed out by the "working class." But now, they are also finding it difficult to feel secure and are fleeing to the south of the Yangtze River in droves.</p>
<p>Confession Meetings: Full of Jokes</p>
<p>After the traitors and "rich" were identified and arrested, "confession meetings" were held. They had to use their own mouths to confess their past faults in front of everyone, without concealing anything, otherwise they would be severely punished. Let me describe a joke from a "confession meeting":</p>
<p>Once, a "confession meeting" was held in a certain town, chaired by the district head. Among them was a stylish middle-aged woman, known as an "outstanding figure of her generation," whose self-confession was quite amusing: "I have loved stealing people since I was a child. I have stolen more than a dozen people so far. Among these dozen, there is a district head..." The district head was stunned and didn't know whether to laugh or cry, staring blankly at this "heroine." The "heroine" continued shamelessly: "Why are you staring at me? Are you still trying to deny it? That day, didn't you and I open a room together at the...inn?" The whole hall burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Putting on Flax Sacks and Cursing Oneself</p>
<p>As for punishing traitors and the "rich," simply putting on a flax sack was not enough to atone for their crimes. The People's Court would set up a high platform in a large, empty square. On the platform were the staff and the criminals, and below the platform were tens of thousands of people. First, the crimes were proclaimed from the platform, and then those below the platform supplemented what was missing. Then, those on the platform would ask those below: "The New Fourth Army is the most reasonable. There are thousands of unreasonable arguments, but only one reasonable one. We are a democratic government, and how to punish them is up to you, the people..." Those subjected to public trial were mostly sentenced to death. It was said that the verdicts were prearranged, or that staff members mixed among the crowd to create a false impression and bewitch the public, in order to kill people under the guise of the people. Thus, the "Liberated Area" was nothing more than a plundering of public opinion.</p>
<p>Fields Abandoned, Nine Out of Ten Houses Empty</p>
<p>Under the lament of "Rather fight to the death than flee," the innocent people of Northern Jiangsu have taken out of the enviable "Liberated" under the name of "Liberated Areas." The reason why laborers and poor people also want to abandon their homes is: "There is no work to do there. All day long, you eat me, I eat you. Families are scattered in several places. The rich have their families ruined, and the poor also have their families scattered. Our lives are extremely simple. We sell our labor for money to support our families, and the family lives in harmony. But now we can't, now we can't..." It is said that in the area from Huai'an to Jieshou Town, farming is taken by those who eat to be wiped clean, and no one wants to farm again. Some have labor, and they go everywhere to get food, so they put down their farming tools and go. There is land but no one to cultivate it, there are houses but no one to live in them. As for immovable property, transactions have been rare for a long time. Now there is a local saying: "Buying fields and buying land is bullshit, selling fields and selling land is venting anger for the family." In elementary and middle schools, only a dozen or so students are left in each school, which is only for decoration, which shows one aspect of the nine out of ten empty houses.</p>
<p>Recruiting Strong Men, Draped in Red</p>
<p>In the "Liberated Area," the strong men who join the army are the supreme and most respected. On the first day of joining the army, officials from the authorities will personally come to pay their respects and give a grand banquet, using a "sedan chair" like those used for small gatherings in the south of the Yangtze River, for the strong soldiers to sit in and be carried. They are draped in red like Wu Song parading the streets, parading through the streets, alleys, villages, and fields amidst the noise of gongs and drums and music.</p>
<p>When a son joins the army, the father is called "Old Grandpa Recruit" by everyone, and all the comforts of the family are provided by others. If there is no field, the landlord will offer a field. If there is no house to live in, someone will build one for you. Others will farm the field for you, and you can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. If a huge disaster befalls you, as long as someone joins the army, everything will turn into an island of safety.</p>
<p>According to the "Military Service Regulations," participation is voluntary, but there are cases of village chiefs being forced to wear "paper turtles" for failing to promote military service vigorously enough.</p>
<p>Are you still saying that you are "fighting for the people"? Then let the reporter tell you that the people have been fought to the brink of death. Please stop! (May 2nd)</p>

<h3>Please Let Everyone Judge! The Problems of the "Liberated Areas" Established by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>To the Chief Editor: In recent days, the issue of the Communist Party has reached a point where it is necessary to distinguish right from wrong. Politically, a truthful examination must be made to assess the value of the Communist Party. Many such articles have already been published in Shanghai. I, as a farmer, am hard-working and resistant to hardship, with no capitalist or feudal inclinations. At the same time, I am also an educated person engaged in rural primary school education, pure and upright. After the July 7th Incident (1937), I went into hiding, and after 1940, I continued to live in seclusion under Communist rule. What I have seen and heard can serve as valuable reference material for the authorities. Having come to Shanghai this spring, I can also be said to have escaped. The following text is submitted for publication. Respectfully, [signature].</p>
<p>The New Fourth Army, led by the Communist Party, arrived in northern Jiangsu Province in the autumn of 1940. At that time, northern Jiangsu was troubled by enemies, puppets, and bandits. The New Fourth Army first captured bandits and established political power. County magistrates and district chiefs continuously posted notices, and the people, after being oppressed for a long time, indeed expressed welcome. Many educated youths, driven by anti-Japanese and patriotic sentiments, resolutely joined, and there were quite a few of them. Naturally, the Communist Party, relying on its propaganda and organizational skills, emphasized that resistance to Japan was non-negotiable, and step by step, it penetrated all aspects of society, cultivated its own strength, and represented the Communist Party as representing the interests of the proletariat, workers, and peasants. In front of the bourgeoisie and gentry, it also stated that the Communist Party was implementing the "Three-Third System," that is, the composition of the political power consisted of one-third workers and peasants, one-third petty bourgeois progressive youth, and one-third big bourgeois enlightened gentry, taking into account the interests of all classes. Little did they know that the other two-thirds, without party backgrounds and without party superiors who could guide politics, were not still subject to the Communist Party's control? This is the first point. The second point is that there was no standard for so-called large and small bourgeoisie. Some families had ten or eight mu, or twenty or thirty mu, or seven or eight mu, or hundreds of mu of land, or previously had thirty or twenty mu, but now, after the children divided the property, they only had ten or eight mu, or even less than that. All of these were acquired by good people through hard work and savings, and most of them were inherited from their ancestors. It can also be said that this is the minimum source of food and clothing for the backbone of the Chinese society. Without this source, how can they live? The Communist Party did not care about these, and generally said that they were the bourgeoisie, arbitrarily listing them as objects of struggle. It seemed that the reason why the lives of workers and peasants were so painful and unhappy was all because of these fellows. They even said that resisting Japan was the first priority, and overthrowing "capitalists" was the second. Alas! Should all these people be called capitalists or landlords? There is also a third point. The Communist Party advocates democracy, with the minority submitting to the majority. Naturally, there are more poor people and more uneducated people in society. How can there be more of them when raising hands at meetings? But we must ask: When Sun Yat-sen launched the revolution at the end of the Qing Dynasty, no one agreed with him. Only one pair of hands of the pioneers and visionaries were raised!</p>
<p>The Communist Party has many theories that are "seemingly correct but actually wrong" or "overcorrecting." They do not know what "too much is as bad as too little" means, nor the meaning of "a slight deviation can lead to a great error." Under these circumstances, there is no way to reason clearly. There are countless names such as: Farmers' Resistance Association, Workers' Resistance Association, Merchants' Resistance Association, Women's Resistance Association, Youth Resistance Association, Teachers' Resistance Association, Children's Corps, Apprentice Teams, Mediation Committees, Rent Reduction Teams, Preferential Treatment Associations, Plowing Teams, Mobilization Committees, Militia Self-Defense Teams, Backbone Teams, Guerrilla Teams, Independent Regiments, Patrol Teams, and so on. Countless committee members, directors, secretaries, chairmen, section chiefs, group leaders, subgroup leaders, squad leaders, platoon leaders, company commanders… Most of these people are illiterate or have only a superficial understanding. They mostly cannot understand the purpose of each association or the title of a certain position. Therefore, "once power is in hand, orders are issued." They are bustling and making every effort to cause trouble for themselves. They may have some merits, but resistance to Japan contains blind resistance to the central government, and revolution hides irredeemable destruction. They only care about the goal and do not care about the means, and the goal is so confused and distorted!</p>
<p>We believe that in such an incomplete Chinese society, only cooperation can bring new life. It is absolutely impossible to divide it into many classes and teach them to fight each other. This is suicide. For example, when the Workers' Resistance Association is successfully organized, the first step is to increase wages. Millions of hands are raised. When the employer cannot afford it, they mobilize their own family members to work, and the workers lose their jobs or work less. If the employer is a teacher, they have to abandon their pens and ink and engage in labor. The children of workers and peasants will have no place to study. Is this progress for society? Of course, we hope that everyone can have a happy life, but this cannot be achieved overnight. It requires multiple creations and cooperation. In northern Jiangsu, what has the Communist Party created besides many empty names, new buzzwords, and boring and tiring organizations? How much has it created in terms of local and substantive construction, such as schools, factories, roads, and bridges? They must argue that the Communist Party has not reached the construction stage. But let me ask, with the one-party dictatorship of workers and peasants, ignoring other cultural figures, engineers, and scientists, who can cultivate and create construction? This is deceiving yourself and others!</p>
<p>We also oppose the real big landlords and capitalists. However, we must distinguish between them and not label those who only have the minimum source of material life as the bourgeoisie and overthrow them all. If all these people are overthrown, will it immediately become a communist paradise, with Chairman Mao providing food and clothing? This is absolutely impossible! For example, among the tenant farmers in the Farmers' Resistance Association, there are also those who cultivate ten or twenty mu of rented land. Now the rent is reduced to a very low level, and there are many other preferential treatments. Renting land is equivalent to freedom, and the propertyless become propertied in an instant. Should they be overthrown again? If they are not overthrown, then those who were overthrown before were too wronged. We believe that Sun Yat-sen's ideal for the Principle of People's Livelihood is to ensure that there are no extremely rich or extremely poor people in society. In other words, everyone is "well-off," and everyone is able to live as a middle class. This is the truth, the truth that the intellectual masses recognize, and we should strive to achieve it.</p>
<p>The Communist Party also has a trick. On the surface, it claims to implement the Three Principles of the People, but internally, it promotes "New Democracy." I have also seen propaganda materials for this doctrine. Apart from coining names such as New Three Principles of the People, Old Three Principles of the People, Revolutionary Three Principles of the People, and Non-Revolutionary Three Principles of the People, nothing was gained. The Communist Party also innovates and promotes New Democratic education, New Democratic culture, etc. The Communist Party also says that we will first implement New Democracy, then Socialism, and then Communism. The portraits hung at important gatherings are those of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Later, after the Japanese surrendered, I occasionally saw portraits of Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang. The author spent five years under Communist rule and finally could not figure out what the Communist Party's political ideals were and what specific steps were being taken.</p>
<p>The winter schools, summer schools, or autumn schools run by the Communist Party are their social education. From the textbooks used in school education, they certainly point out that the central government is autocratic, and the leader is a dictator. They also deny everything about others. Only they themselves are good, and others do not resist Japan or revolt. The Communist Party also thoroughly denies Confucianism, believing that Confucius's doctrines such as propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the protectors of the autocratic bourgeoisie. Their Chinese textbooks are all propaganda; "history" is also colored with red eyes, and many important historical facts are not mentioned. They only talk about the beauty of primitive communist society, and later enlightened rulers and virtuous officials are all autocrats or those who help autocrats; "geography" only talks about where the Communist army has bases and where the liberated areas are. They believe that education must serve progressive politics, and the value of education itself will be reduced to zero. Just imagine, what kind of state will education and culture reach after several years under Communist rule? This is truly frightening!</p>
<p>In the Communist democratic areas, anyone who has even a slight source of food and clothing is a sinner. They are attacked at meetings, have their workload increased in public service, pay heavier taxes than others, and always suffer in mediation committees. Appealing to county and district governments is even more unfavorable to you. Only when everyone is reduced to being propertyless can they raise their heads and eyebrows and gain the trust of the authorities, and they can handle "official affairs" and speak "official language." Therefore, the name "mud-legged people" became very popular for a while!</p>
<h3>"Hot Spring Village" Turns into a Gentle Village - A Pair of Bright Eyes in Taipei</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's 6th dispatch, Special Correspondent Mu Yun</p>
<p>Beitou and Caoshan are a pair of bright eyes in Taipei.</p>
<p>Beitou is the only hot spring county, surrounded by mountains on three sides: Datun, Qixing, and Shaomao, while the other side is a vast plain. Because it is a sulfur producing area, there are hot springs everywhere. The hot springs have three types: earthy springs, acidic springs, and sulfur springs, with temperatures ranging from 50 to 68 degrees Celsius, which can treat neuralgia, skin diseases, malaria, diabetes, and gynecological diseases. It was discovered by a German named Horry during the Guangxu period (late Qing Dynasty), and later Hirata Genkichi, a Japanese, was the first to open a business. The Japanese spent a lot of energy and money in the hot spring area of ​​Datun Park, which transformed it into the prosperous scene it is today. There are more than 30 hotels, which attract tourists from the city with their exquisite decorations and "hot springs that never stop at night."</p>
<p>Caoshan is located in the embrace of Qixing and Shaomao Mountains at an altitude of 400 meters, with a lower temperature of 8-9 degrees Celsius than Beitou. It is purely a summer resort. The hot springs here are generally better than those in Beitou, without a strong sulfur smell, but the surface prosperity is far less than that of Beitou.</p>
<p>These two places have the same characteristic, which is the beauty of the tourist lodges scattered on the mountainside, painted green. Especially in the early morning and evening, when the fog has not dissipated, the shadows of the verdant tropical plants make people love them even more. There is a quiet beauty here, as well as the beautiful youth, like a beautiful prose poem, or a poetic mood.</p>
<p>The Taipei County Government has established a Hot Spring Management Committee here. The sixteen hotels that were taken over and several hotels in Caoshan and Yilan are all managed by the committee. The current method of renting is divided into four types: A, B, C, and D. The highest monthly rent is 6,000 yuan. However, due to the chaos of the takeover, some have been occupied by various agencies as clubs, and some that are open are empty. It is said that there is a black market for renting, with the highest price reaching tens of thousands of yuan. Recently, the general prices have soared, but on Saturday nights, nearly a thousand civil servants enjoy lavish nights here, with more than 500 women providing them with revelry. The cost for each person is equivalent to half a month's salary for a small civil servant—500 yuan!</p>
<p>This kind of indulgent lifestyle is a good contrast to the lives of civil servants who are worried about not having rice for dinner. However, the old owners of the hotels who benefit from it are afraid that this will prolong the bad social atmosphere brought by people from the mainland! Hot Spring Village is now a "gentle village" throughout the country!</p>
<h3>Shrine Pilgrimage</h3>
<p>The Japanese who came across the sea had to first worship the Taiwan Shrine.</p>
<p>The "sacred area" of the shrine occupies the southern foot of the vast Datun volcanic group of Jiantan Mountain, facing Zhongshan Park. Passing through Zhongshan Bridge, one is shaded by huge wooden pillars. The hinoki trees, nearly two arms wide, make it difficult to see the top when you look up. This is the gate of revelation for the shrine. It is also the object of remote worship for the "servant of the emperor." Now, however, a large slogan "Practice the Three Principles of the People, Follow the Teachings of the Premier" is hung high.</p>
<p>People naturally feel that times have changed. Even the area of ​​the "gods" who were "respected" in the past has changed its appearance. Here are enshrined "Ōkuninushi," "Ōnamuchi," "Sukuhikona," and "Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa." These invaders who robbed Taiwan by force were worshiped as "gods" by their warlords and worshiped by their descendants. The government advocates turning the shrine into a public education hall, but after the reporter's investigation, I deeply feel that this special feature of the change is not easily accepted by the people of the province.</p>
<p>Following the stone road on the slope, walk towards the front of the shrine. The stone lanterns "donated by" various groups of invaders, the broken-eyed bronze bulls squatting there, are still symbols of the development of agriculture in Taiwan. Looking out from the green, the clear stream of the Keelung River, the bridge of the Tamsui River, and the white sails are surrounded by green hills. Breathing in the natural atmosphere of the basin under the suffocation of "god."</p>
<p>The front of the shrine should be stationed by the National Army. The large pillar for applying lights is broken, the bell pavilion has disappeared, the money box in the courtyard is empty, and a large pile of god boxes are lined up beside the tightly closed gate. Chaotic knife marks are drawn on the camphor wood pillars. There is no one, no shadow. We are like a desolate ancient temple. The monthly festival on the 28th is gone, and the grand festival on October 28th has become even more distant.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the shrine, we saw a monument to the "martyred" police at the foot of the mountain, soldiers who served the "imperial country." Forty years ago, they were slaughtered by righteous "bandits." The island's nationhood is clearly reflected here. There is also an old 33-caliber mortar, a souvenir from the siege of Lushun in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. It has not been eroded too much by the wind and rain, but it has repaid its blood debt.</p>
<p>The realm of gods and humans, manipulated by the invaders, is where the "gods" have also disappeared.</p>

<h3>On Industrial Construction</h3>
<p>— Lin Han</p>
<p>Following the victorious end of the war, the first arduous and urgent task is nation-building. Whether our country can truly become a modern nation-state, truly escape the status of a semi-colony, and leap to become one of the five great powers, the issue lies in whether we can complete industrialization within a short period and lay the foundation for nation-building. The unequal treaties have been abolished, victory has arrived, and consequently, the task of maintaining peace has become heavier! Whether our country can shoulder this heavy responsibility depends on whether we have the strength to manage peace and maintain security. The first phase of economic construction principles announced by the government at the end of the lunar year before last was formulated in response to this need and as a path for construction. The particularly important aspects of these principles, as Minister Weng said: First, economic enterprises other than those solely operated by the government, including postal and telecommunications, military industries, minting, major railways, and large-scale hydroelectric power plants, can be operated by the people. The government's activities should focus on practical and necessary state-owned industries. Many large enterprises, such as petroleum mines, steel mills, and shipping, which are beyond the capabilities of private individuals, can still be solely operated by the government or jointly operated by the government and private individuals. Other economic development welcomes the efforts of private enterprises. Second, regarding the regulations for welcoming foreign investment: no restrictions are placed on foreign investment. For all Sino-foreign joint ventures, except that the chairman of the board of directors must still be a national, all other regulations deemed inconvenient by foreigners are completely abolished. The Chinese government, in participating in state-owned enterprises, only exercises administrative supervision rights and only exercises the rights of shareholders in the company's daily operations, without interfering. Special discussions on related matters are briefly summarized to benefit those involved in industrial construction.</p>
<p>The goal of economic construction is industrialization, and its structure is a planned economy. "Because industry and politics are interdependent, their success or failure are mutually causal. In the past, industrialists often lacked a national perspective and rarely studied national policies and laws, while those engaged in politics did not fully recognize the importance of industry and did not know that supporting industry was their responsibility. Therefore, industry and politics became disconnected, and the difficulties of industry increased. Therefore, if we want to complete the country's industrial construction, we must promote the connection between industry and politics." (See Chairman Chiang's speech at the Industrial Construction Planning Conference). Therefore, in the future, under the leadership and support of the government, the industrial sector should work closely with the government, and all its plans and work must be in line with government policies in order to achieve the overall industrialization of the country.</p>
<p>The issue of state-owned and private enterprises in industrial construction has already been clearly stipulated in the economic construction principles. All enterprises with monopolistic characteristics and those that private capital cannot operate are state-owned. The remaining light and heavy industries related to people's livelihood are highly expected to be developed by private enterprises. The two are related and proceed in parallel, and there is no conflict. Now, because there are still a lack of clear and detailed rules for state-owned and private enterprises, state-owned enterprises have superior special conditions and are suspected of competing with private individuals for profit and打击 private enterprises. This point deserves great attention. As for the question of which should be established first, light or heavy industries, heavy industries are necessary for national defense and related to security, while light industries are indispensable for enriching the country and benefiting the people. Both are necessary to be called a modern country; however, the establishment of heavy industries is not an easy task. The Soviet Union's three five-year plans, with painstaking efforts, endured hunger and cold for more than ten years to succeed. Our heavy industry must be established, our strength must be concentrated, and we must be prepared to suffer for one or two decades! As for the establishment of light industry, in principle, it is up to the private sector to work hard, and the government provides guidance and assistance. The industrial sector itself must not engage in extra-legal profit-seeking (such as hoarding and speculation), and all floating capital must be converted into capital for industrial construction. The focus of heavy industry is on transportation industry and national defense industry, while the focus of light industry is on the textile industry, food industry, and daily necessities industry. Under the conditions of industrialization and export, the standards of these industries must be established in order to become industrialized in name and in reality.</p>
<p>The capital issue of industrial construction is also the capital issue of economic construction. According to Professor Wu Qiyuan's opinion: "Economic construction is a construction that uses a large amount of capital. The amount of capital, the structure of capital... all have a great impact on economic construction. In the first phase of economic construction, the first issue related to capital is the amount of capital. This quantitative issue includes both the amount of capital required and the fundraising. The amount of capital is limited by the relationship between supply and demand, on the one hand, based on the requirements of nation-building, and on the other hand, based on the country's economic strength. In the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, the annual capital for economic construction was fifty times the US dollar. Some people, based on China's pre-war economic situation, believe that we can raise about 200 million yuan of capital every year as the minimum investment for economic construction. However, it is estimated that the annual capital amount can be listed as 2 billion US dollars, a total of 10 billion US dollars in five years. Because China's economic construction must be completed within two or thirty years after the end of the war, the capital of industrial, mining, and transportation industries should be close to 80 billion US dollars after the completion of economic construction, so the total capital for economic construction should be no less than 100 billion US dollars. Regarding fundraising, China's annual national income before the war was about 10 billion US dollars (Professor Clark's estimate of 20 billion is too high). China's annual national savings before the war were 700 million US dollars. The average annual central financial expenditure before the war was about 300 million US dollars. The total amount of legal tender issued was about 400 million US dollars. The national bank deposits were about 1.4 billion US dollars. The annual capital inflow before the war was only 100 million US dollars. Remittances from overseas Chinese were less than 110 million US dollars. From this kind of figures, it is not easy to raise 2 billion capital every year, but the situation is different from before the war: (1) The recovery of the Northeast is extremely helpful for the fundraising of economic construction capital. (2) The international situation has changed, China's international status has been improved, and foreign capital can be easily borrowed from friendly countries and international institutions (such as the International Bank). (3) War reparations. These three aspects of change can make it easier for us to raise funds. One fundraising method is: (A) National capitalists account for 2.1 billion, (B) The government accounts for 1 billion, (C) 3 billion is taken from war reparations, (D) Foreign capital accounts for 4 billion. The source of domestic capital is national savings, and the ways to increase it are national production and conservation. The fundraising methods for foreign capital are roughly: 1 (A) The surplus materials of the United States and Britain after the war can be used for economic construction in various countries. According to Gu Chunfan's estimate, the surplus materials after the US demobilization can be used for economic construction in backward countries, totaling 27 billion US dollars. The surplus materials of the United Kingdom can be used for economic construction in backward countries, and the amount must also be considerable. The United States and Britain have a part of the disposal of this kind of materials that can be used to lend to China and other countries. (B) Borrowing loans for indirect investment or directly participating in operations. (C) International Bank loans. (D) War reparations." (See Yu Dagongbao Weekly Thesis) However, in fact, the national economy has been greatly damaged due to the suffering of the war, especially the losses of farmers. In addition, coupled with disasters and epidemics, we are not optimistic about the post-war income surplus and accumulation of the Chinese people; and the situation in the Northeast is special, and all industrial and transportation equipment has been destroyed or dismantled by the Soviet Union and the Communist army. The help that the Northeast can give to economic construction in the ideal situation has been greatly devalued. Regarding foreign capital, according to Gu Chunfan's observation during his trip to the United States: "The disposal of surplus materials in the United States... has newly formulated disposal bills, and the principle is to sell the materials quickly at a good price and not disturb the market; the most important heavy industry and chemical industry can hardly be disposed of without the consent of Congress, so we cannot overly expect surplus materials to be beneficial to us. Foreign investors are all taking a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the clarity of China's politics and the stability of the order; and Americans doubt that although the Chinese government and people say that they welcome foreign capital, the narrow national thought of protecting national capital is often expressed or seen in legislation. They doubt whether China welcomes foreign capital? Generally speaking, Americans are not very interested in investing in China. On the contrary, American businessmen are looking for markets in China. At present, most of the investment from the Americans is direct. If we want to hope for their loans or sell Chinese stocks and bonds in the United States, the time is not yet ripe." (See Yu Dagongbao) However, due to the promulgation of the economic construction principles and the recent changes in the domestic situation, such as the mediation of the cessation of military conflict, political agreements, and the government's upcoming reorganization, etc. (although such mediation and agreements have problems at the moment, we can firmly believe that the country must and will be united and unified), will all increase the interest of foreign investors, make their investment at ease, and increase our international status and credit.</p>
<p>The materials for industrial construction are the resources and equipment for industrialization. According to Mr. Wu Jingchao's research on forty-four materials that are closely related to people's daily life. Our country can have a surplus of eight types: silk, soybeans, rapeseed, coal, tungsten, tin, antimony, and salt; there are twenty-eight types that can be expected to be self-sufficient: rice, wheat, cotton, hemp, sugar, cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, mules, wool, leather, wood, rock oil, molybdenum, manganese, magnesium, mercury, aluminum, sulfur, nitrate, potassium, phosphorus, mica, refractory materials, fluorite, lime, and gypsum; those that cannot be self-sufficient are rubber, iron, nickel, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc. The most serious of these is that the total output of iron is less than 1% of the world's total. In terms of equipment, our country's existing equipment is extremely poor and backward, and is not worth mentioning. The solution to the material problem, on the one hand, urgently needs to expand the source and production; on the other hand, it should import a large number of machines and the raw materials that are lacking from friendly countries.</p>
<p>The talent problem is also a basic problem of industrial construction. Industrialization is mechanization, and there must be a large number of technical and management talents. As Dagongbao said: "In the early stage of the Soviet Union's implementation of the five-year plan, it hired a lot of foreign engineers. Judging from the trend, we will also need to rely on foreign personnel to participate in industrial construction in the future, but in any case, we must have a large number of second- and third-rate industrial talents and cooperate with foreign engineers, gradually learn, and lead." This is a very correct statement. Our country's lack of talent is undeniable; what is urgently needed in the future is technical cadres. How to train this kind of talent is of course the responsibility of the education authorities. However, the production plants widely recruiting apprentices and setting up technical schools is also a very effective method.</p>
<p>In summary, we can know that our country's industrial construction capital is not sufficient, and the environment is also unfavorable. The long and arduous journey requires us to work hard! At the time of the turning point of the country's destiny, the time is urgent, short, and precious. We hope that we can rise up and strive to seize this once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity, give up everything, and vow to work hard to build a modern new China.</p>
<h3>Art and Industry</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>In the materials provided by the United States Information Service, there is an article on advertising paintings and industry, the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Christian Science Monitor recently published an article stating that the 'Modern Advertising Art Exhibition' currently held in Philadelphia proves that the industry can invite professional artists to create advertising designs for their products to promote business because the industry's products can be presented to readers in a new way in various magazines and newspapers with the help of artists. According to the newspaper's report: There are a total of ninety-seven advertising art works exhibited in the Philadelphia Art Alliance since February 21. The earliest one is from 1937, and the latest one is from 1945. It illustrates that the industry has come to a good opportunity. However, the Monitor pointed out that the number of companies currently commissioning artists to depict beautiful advertising paintings of products has also greatly increased.</p>
<p>During the war, various ministries and departments of the government, compelled by the needs of the war, recruited important artists to produce propaganda paintings such as public bonds and recruitment. On the other hand, advertising companies also took the principle that wartime advertisements should be as simple and short as possible, so they also abandoned complex painting methods. The Monitor also said: The Philadelphia exhibition proves that daily necessities will be beautifully presented in newspaper and magazine advertising columns.</p>
<p>French artist Fernand Léger has two works participating in the exhibition. He once commented on the relationship between modern art and industry, saying: 'Industrialists will increasingly need the works of artists. In order to assist the industry, we have been able to establish a new relationship between art and industry. This relationship is of course based on social interests: it will open up a road for thousands of people to appreciate contemporary art.'"</p>
<p>What Léger said is not wrong at all, because there is indeed a very close relationship between art and industry. Loving beauty is the nature of human beings. From the packaging of goods to the advertising pictures published in newspapers, all must include artistic elements, otherwise it will only be an appearance and cannot have a close relationship with the influence of ordinary people and the entire social life.</p>
<p>Many emerging countries, especially the United States, made extensive use of art as a good tool for propaganda during the war. In fact, when construction begins, it is even more necessary to use art. Therefore, in the future, China can make extensive use of art in construction work, so that propaganda can be more effective, and the industry should also attach importance to art, so that the two can work together to produce the expected results.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to this point, everyone feels the lack of talent. For the sake of future construction, cultivating art talent as soon as possible is also a matter of urgency.</p>
<h3>Production Tidbits</h3>
<p>According to rough estimates, 10% of U.S. agricultural products are damaged by insects.</p>
<p>The origin of the almond tree is subtropical China, Persia, Syria, and Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Soybeans are now the magic agricultural product of the United States, 13% of the cooking oil is made from soybeans, and it is also the only livestock feed with the most protein.</p>
<p>Coal, which used to be considered only a source of heat and energy, is now an important raw material for synthetic wool, synthetic rubber, etc., and may be the main source of fuel for automobiles in the future.</p>
<p>Gasoline can be manufactured using natural coal gas in a factory near Texas; this factory uses 65 million cubic feet of natural coal gas to produce 5,000 barrels of gasoline and 1,000 barrels of diesel fuel every day.</p>
<p>The fog machine, which was invented to cover military operations, has now been used to spread insecticide powder on crops in the fields.</p>
<p>Before sandpaper was invented, shark skin was used as an abrasive.</p>
<p>Dried eggs, which were invented for wartime applications, may be widely used to make ice cream in the future.</p>
<p>Dolomite found in northern Chile has very useful properties. Dolomite can be used to make cement (HydarnlicCement) for hydraulic construction.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Responsibility to Society</p>
<p>A manager must strive to ensure that the quantity of goods he manufactures meets the quantity required by the market, that is, not to produce too much, because overproduction will create a depression. When the United States in 1919, the production volume of manufacturing plants exceeded the actual quantity required by the market, so all the goods were shelved on the way of sales or placed on the shelves of retailers, no one bought them, or these goods existed in the hands of hoarders, hoping to increase prices for profit, resulting in an unprecedented market depression in 1920.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of the welfare of the entire market, never overproduce, and production and sales must be balanced at all times. A manager must always consider the following questions as the basis for his decision-making on all matters:</p>
<p>1.  Is it necessary to find ways to obtain working capital (such as borrowing mortgages, etc.) to increase production?</p>
<p>2.  How to formulate the annual sales budget, which must take into account how the purchasing power of the general public in the market is? How is the general economic strength? If the purchasing power of the general public is very weak, but we are manufacturing an aristocratic commodity? Then we are bound to be unable to sell it.</p>
<p>3.  Should the purchase of raw materials be bought immediately? Or wait for a while, and also consider the quantity to be purchased, because buying too little is not enough for application, and buying too much will reduce working capital.</p>
<p>4.  How should the increase in wages be handled? Because this point has a close relationship with the cost of goods, but on the one hand, it must also take into account the general standard of living and the general trend?</p>
