<h3>孫科逐條報吿　憲草修正經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕孫科在大會對憲草之報吿，係根據五五憲草與修正案各條，逐一說明：</p>
<p>第二章總綱第一條，原爲「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」，現經採納各方意見，修正爲「中華民國基於三民主義爲民有民治民享之民主共和國」。</p>
<p>第二章，人民之權利義務，自第六條至廿五條，其第廿四條亦有所修改，蓋人民之自由權利，如過妨碍他人自由，避免緊急危難，維持社會秩序，或增進公共利益所必要者，得以法律限制之。此亦即以保障大多數的自由。</p>
<p>第三章國　大會章，則較五五憲草修正擴大其組織，以立法委員及監察委員列爲國大當然代表，而在開會期間爲代表，閉會期間則仍爲各該院委員，藉以溝通政府與地方代表之意見。又原草案內國　大會之職權，有罷免總統副總統及各院院長副院長之權，現經修正僅有罷免正副總統之權。</p>
<p>第四章總統章，亦略有出入，如總統發佈緊急命令，必須於發布命令後一個月內，提交立法院追認，如立法院不同意，該命令即失效，與原案差異較大。其次總統對院與院間之爭執，可召集有關各院院長會商解決。</p>
<p>第五章，較原草案修改之點甚多，如行政院院長由總統任命，必先經立法院同意。第五十八條。行政院對立法院爲有限的負責。　　立法院得對行政院投不信任投票，且立法委員不得兼任行政官吏，故非責任內閣制。行政院對立法院通過之法律案，得經總統核可，提請複議，、此爲總統制之優點。</p>
<p>第六章，立法，略有修正第七章，司法，確定司法院，即係最高審判機關，採委員制，設大法官，其委員與大法官均不得有黨籍。</p>
<p>第八章考試，亦採委員制，第九章監察，本案賦以同意權，總統任命司法考試委員，應經監察院同意。</p>
<p>第十章，增列中央與地方之權限，採均權與列舉制，第十一章，省縣制度，較原草案詳盡，第十三章，爲原草案國民經濟敎育兩章之合併，現尙包括國防軍事。</p>

<h3>保護政權發展民權　望確立國家大法　蔣主席於國大會上致詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕蔣主席在廿八日上午國民大會第三次會議中，於提出憲法草案後，所作之演說，原詞如次：</p>
<p>國民大會代表諸君：</p>
<p>今天國民政府提出中華民國憲法草案，送請國民大會審議，本席趁此機會，要將國民政府制定憲法草案的經過，以及本席對於制憲的意見，向大會簡單报吿，以供代表諸君的參考。</p>
<p>國民政府制定憲法草案的努力，開始於民國二十二年，經中國國民黨議決交國民政府立法院成立憲法起草委員會起草憲法，到民國二十五年憲草完成，由國民政府於當年五月五日正式公佈，這就是後來所謂五五憲草，是國民政府制定憲法草案的第一時期。</p>
<p>當時國民政府原定二十六年十一月召開國民大會，制頒憲法，不料二十六年七月七日抗戰發生，國民大會不得不延期召開，而憲法草案的產生，乃進入第二時期。</p>
<p>這一時期由二十六年抗戰開始，到三十四年抗戰勝利，前後八年之間，政府對於憲法軍案，不斷發動大家來研討，徵詢各方的意見，以求完善。最初在二十八年，由國民參政會組織憲政期成會，對五五憲草作進一步的研討與修訂。到了三十二年，國民參政會，又成立了憲政實施協進會，廣泛徵求全國人民對於憲草的意見，以期集思廣益，制定一部完美的憲法。這是憲章產生的第二時期。</p>
<p>從抗戰勝利到今天爲止，這一年中的時間，是憲法草案產生的第三時期。</p>
<p>政府在今年一月石開了政治協商會議，決定將五五憲草加以修故，並將憲政期成會修正案，和憲政實施協進會，對於憲法草案研討結果，一併交由經草審議委員會歸納研究。根據政治協商會議，所決定的修改原則，彙綜整理來起草修正的條文，但到四月下旬以後，因爲中國共產黨主張保留修正的工作，乃一時陷於停頓。直到十一月十八·十九兩日，政府再度與中國靑年黨。民主社會黨，及社會賢達，兩次會商，根據政協的修改原則，再加審訂整理和補充成爲完整的草案。經立法院於廿一日完成立法程序，這就是今天國民政府向國民大會提出的中華民國憲法草案。這一個憲法草案的完成，中國共產黨雖沒有參加，而當時參加政協的大多數黨派，是經過同意的。　中華民國憲法草案的成立，前後計歷十四年的時間，經過多次的修改，今天纔由國民政府，提請國民大會審議，本席今天代表政府提出這個草案以後，回憑我們國父領導革命五十餘年中閱，又經過八年長期的抗戰，我們一般革命先烈與軍民同胞，拋頭顱流熱血犧牲奮鬥，百折不回，乃能有今天的國民大會來討論這部憲草，可以說這部憲草是五十年來全國軍民先烈血淚鑄成的。本席今天一方面追念我們這一部憲草完成之不易，同時想到將來憲法制定以後，對於國家的治亂與民族的盛衰關係，至爲重大。因此不能不披瀝眞誠，將我個人對於憲法的見解，和對於大會的期望，提出來就正於諸君。</p>
<p>接愛人民重托　制定完美憲法</p>
<p>今天國民政府將憲法草案提交國民大會以後，可以說政府已經將國家的責任，交給全國人民了。從今天起，全國人民就要開始担負這個重大的責任，（鼓掌）各位代表受全國人民的重託，必須審察時勢，　克盡職責，制定一部完美可行的憲法，纔不負全國人民的期望，（鼓掌）代表諸君責在制憲，我們所制定的憲法，不僅要求形式的完善，而且要求其能付諸實行而無窒碍。自從政府公布五五憲草以後，經過全國人民十年的研討，已經深入人心，五五憲草是根據國父的五權憲法而制定的，大家都知道國父所發明的五權憲法，是世界上最新的最進步的憲法，但是政府　　爲什麼要修正五五憲草，爲什麽政府今天提出的憲草與國父五　憲法有不能完全符合之處？這一點，木席今天必須加以解釋。</p>
<p>國父在發明五權憲法之後，就常常面示我們：「有了良好的憲法，還要有忠實的施行憲法的人，最好是由創制憲法的人來行憲，然後纔能發揚憲法的精義。否則，如果行憲的人，不明瞭立憲的精神，則行憲就不會確實而順利，「這一段話，我今天特別要提起代表諸君的注意。國父五權憲法的精義，在於權能分開，政權與治權分開，要使這個憲法的精義盡量發　，必須具備兩個條件：</p>
<p>第一，必須行使政權的人民，具有掌握政權確保政權的能力和習慣。</p>
<p>憲二，必須行使治權的政府，能够恪守治權的界限，不以治權來侵犯政權。如果行使治權的人，不能尊重政權，而侵犯政權，同時行使政權的人，又沒有掌握政權的能力與習慣，則其結果必致完全違背國父創制的精神、所以五權憲法，最好是由國父本人來行使，以治權來保護政權，培育政權，養成人民行使政權的能力和習慣，使政權與治權相輔相成，政府不致於無能，人民不致於無權，纔能臻於理想，如果行憲的人，不能以國父的精神爲精神，對於政權不能盡保育護持的責任，則將來一定要發生流弊。</p>
<p>因爲五權憲法的中央制度，可以說是一種總統制，行使政權的人民，如果沒有掌握政權的能力，對於治權不能有適當的控制，則總統權力過分集中，必致形成極權政治，這種政治，是不合於現在時代，而且有害於中國，有害於中華民族的。（大鼓掌）</p>
<p>憲法制頒有期　務使有利人民</p>
<p>各位代表諸君，信奉國父遺敎，服膺五權憲法，決不願使國父的五權憲法，流爲極權政治，貽害於國家民族。所以我今天要請大家估量我們一般同胞行使政權的能力和習慣，審察國際環境和時代趨向。我們如果在今天就實行五權憲法，人民是否能掌握政權，而不受治權的侵犯呢？我可以說，目前我國大多數的人民，還沒有這種能力和習慣如果這樣毫無保障就實行五權憲法，我個人認爲非常危險。當然以我們國家人才之多，國父遺敎感人之深，自有許多具備行使治權能力，而瞭解五權憲法精神的人物。不過代表諸君，要知道，在人民還不能自己堂握政權，鞏固政權的時候，要完全信賴行使治權的人來尊重政權，這究竟是一種冒險的嘗試。</p>
<p>我相信假如我自己來行使五權憲法，我能以國父之心爲心，以治權來保護政權，培育政權使民權充分發展（大鼓掌）。但是我個人自民國十四年國父逝世以後，爲國奮鬥，担負重責，已經廿年了。祇因國基未固，憲政未行，革命天職不容放棄，對於國事義無容辭，現在國民大會已經開會，憲法制頒有期，革命建國的工作，已可吿一段落，我個人本來沒有政治的慾望和興趣，而且我今年已經六十歲，再不能像過去二十年一樣担負繁重的責任，所以必須將國家的責任交託於全國的同胞。更因爲如此，所以我特別關心於國家大法的確立，務使行之有利於國家，有利於人民。（大鼓掌）</p>
<p>希望深長考慮　奠立憲政初基</p>
<p>今天我代表國民政府，提出憲草於大會，當然尊重大會的意見，同時我以人民代表的立塲，爲保護政權，發展民權着想，對於今天國民政府所提出的憲法草案，我是贊成的。擁護的，我認爲五五憲草，在今天是不適用的。我今天將我十四年來，對於憲法的體騐貢獻於代表諸君，希望諸君爲國家民族深長考慮，奠立憲政實施良好的初基。須知今後國家的存亡隆替，民族的盛衰榮辱，都繫於憲政施行之是否順利。而制憲的責任，則在於代表諸君</p>
<p>我們今天制定憲法，一定要至公至誠，純粹爲國家的安寗和人民的福利着想，切不可膠柱鼓瑟，更不可削足適履，忽略民衆的需要，無視時代的因素。我們要集思廣益，審愼周詳，制定一部完美可行的憲法，使全國人民都能受到實行，使我們國父和五十年來的革命先烈與抗戰陣亡將士的英靈，得以安慰於地下。</p>
<p>總之，我們所要制定的憲法，必須切實可行，能使國家長治久安，建設工作得以邁進，而後民生樂利，民權自然一天天的發展而鞏固。到了這個時候，我相信我們的國父的五權憲法，一定能完全實現。最後敬祝諸位，共同努力，完成我們偉大神聖的制憲任務。（熱烈鼓掌）（完）</p>

<h3>撤退留瀋鐵路人員　蘇使館發表聲明　中央社說明新聞來源正確</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕蘇駐華大使館情報部，廿八日十一時發表聲明，原文如下：關於中央社十一月廿二日瀋陽電訊，蘇駐華大使館認爲必須爲如下之聲明：中央社報道稱，該社自權威方面探悉：「中國政府與蘇聯當局幾經磋商後，遂決定遣送蘇籍鐵路員工返國」。蘇駐華大使館確曾一再向中國外交部提出自瀋陽撤退蘇籍員工之問題，然中央社對大使館採取此一步驟之眞正理由，則加以曲解。蘇籍鐵路員工之返蘇，並非由於彼等個人健康不佳，或經濟窘迫，實係由於彼等雖有職位，而不能執行任務之事賞所使。數月來，中國當局造成種種非但對彼等之工作甚且對彼等之居留瀋陽，亦屬難堪之情况。大使館所得多種資料，咸證實如下之事實，即當地之行政與軍事當局，非唯不能予蘇籍員工以應得之保護，反使若干蘇籍員工遭受中國軍　與警察亦參加助虐之毆擊，以及其他非法行爲所造成之犧牲。多數之蘇籍員工，由於彼等之私人財產，或爲地方官吏取去，或爲中國軍人搶掠，物質環境皆極困難。同時，中長鐵路局之中國人員，事實上早已阻止參加長春蘇籍員工，實際鐵路瀋陽段之工作。中國之地方當局，旣於瀋陽造成如斯之情况，蘇聯員工乃知無繼續居留彼處之可能。又中央社堅稱：尙有蘇籍工作人員二百名。將續留瀋陽一點，亦不確實。所有蘇籍員工，均將於日內返回蘇聯。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕按本社瀋陽廿二日電，關於中長路瀋陽之蘇籍部分員工請求撤退返國一事，蘇方曾商請在瀋陽患病生活困難與工作較少部份蘇籍員工調回蘇聯，我方曾表示挽留，嗣與蘇方幾經磋商，我政府終於同意蘇方之要求，對於該部份員工，暫尤其返國，並由我政府給予交通上之便利，餘由路局備車送往天津，搭蘇輪返國，並酌給其返國旅費。至其餘蘇籍員工百餘人，現仍留路，繼續工作。上述消息，乃爲本社記者自瀋陽中長路方面所探悉者。</p>
<h3>蘇聯撤退員工　並非外交策略</h3>
<p>某方人士評蘇聯聲明</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十八日電〕蘇聯大使館二十八日午間，發表對中長路蘇籍員工撤退返國一事之聲明，批駁中央社之報導後，引起此間廣泛注意。並使此一積壓月餘之問題，突趨表面化。中央社常請示中宣部，並與外部接洽，對此將有所解釋。唯記者探悉，中央社瀋電內容，與外部東北特派員張劍非之公文報吿，並無何差誤。蘇籍員工二百人，將續留瀋陽一點，亦屬符合。外都爲澈底明瞭此問題眞象，已訓令張氏詳連查報，並即與張嘉璈，　式輝聯絡，以備參考。另據某有資格之人士稱：蘇方聲明多數蘇籍員工之私人財產被沒收，或搶掠一點，在東北甫由國軍接收，秩序猶屬混亂之際，容或有若干偶發事件，但絕非我訓練極嚴之新國防部隊官兵所爲者。於接收完竣，秩序恢復後，更不致再有同類情形發生，蘇方聲明並未指出確實之時間與事件。又所云蘇　員工遭受中國軍隊與警察亦參加助虐之歐擊一點，吾人不知東北是否曾由於新近取得蘇聯國籍之白俄，與當地民衆不睦，而發生何種衝突事件。唯吾人可大膽推定，如蘇聯僑民在東北，確曾遭受如此有意之虐待，且中國政軍當局不予應得之保障時，吾人之友邦蘇聯必早已不甘沉默，不須待中央社報導加以批駁時，始僅有所聲明。視此聲明之直接動機，純係由於中央社之報導所引起，吾人寗可認爲，此僅係一新聞報導正誤之問題，深不欲加以神經過敏之揣測，以爲蘇方此舉有外交策略性質，致使目前所傳大連情勢，對中蘇關係間漫佈之疑雲上，再覆以不輕鬆之空氣，影響兩國之友誼。</p>
<h3>北韓蘇軍司令拜會趙公武氏</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿八日電〕蘇軍駐北韓最高司令官，定廿八日午由　　州過江來安東，拜會我第三綏靖區司令官趙公武將軍，安東準備盛大歡迎午假鴨江春歡宴。</p>

<h3>外部條約司長發表聲明　解釋中美商約內容　雙方享受平等互惠利益</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕外交部條約司長王化成，須就中美商約問題發表負責聲明如下：</p>
<p>中美商約全文公佈後，各界評論甚多，但若干人士對於該約內容，似未完全明瞭，因此不免有所誤解，總觀各界批評，最着重之點，僉以中美兩國國力不同，我國不能根據條約而享受與美國同樣之平等互惠利益。對於此點，我方於談判中，無時不予以細密之注意。</p>
<p>在談判之全部過中，我政府始終以次列三點爲其指導原則：</p>
<p>第一，中美新商約之訂立，於我爲必要，此點極易明瞭，因爲領事裁判權，租界等等，雖經最近中美新約廢除，中美之間，不平等商約，依然存在，此等商約，大都只規定外人在華應享之待遇，而未規定中國僑民在各該國應享之待遇，在新商約未訂立以前，舊商約依然有效，故訂立平等新商約，在我方實爲必要。</p>
<p>第二，對於經商居住旅行等事，我必須給予凡不歧視華人的國家之國民以適常之保陣，蓋我如不給予此種保障，則中國與各國的關係，必當呈一種磨擦而不和諧之狀態，如果我國欲鼓勵外資與外國技術之論入，尤不宜任令此種狀態之存在或發展。</p>
<p>第三，中國政府與人民，在經濟文化方面，所需要之安全保障，必須於條約中設定一切必要之保留條款；蓋我國爲工業落後科學落後之國家，倘無此種條款，我國國民在國外繼能受到平等互惠之益，而在國內則不免受到損害，我現在要將中美新約中我政府所設定之保留條款爲詳細之叙述，以供留心此約者之研考，余之爲此說明，決無一毫自詡交涉成功之念，在此次談判交涉之中，中美雙方均無絲毫爭取片面的勝利之意念，此爲此次交涉之一大特色，而余敢負責以吿中美兩國人士者也。美國方面，對於中國之困難，凡經我方指出，無不竭誠考慮，我國對於美方之困難，亦持同樣之態度。次列諸種保留條款。即因有此和諧空氣，始獲成立。</p>
<p>（一）關於雙方國民在彼此領土內就業之保留——該約第二條第二款規定締約此方之國民，僅能從事於非專爲締約被方國民所保留之各種職業，因之締約一方，如認爲某種職業應保留於其本國國民，自可隨時以法律爲之。</p>
<p>（二）關於雙方國民法入及團體，從事各種事業之保留——該約第二條規定，締約此方國民得在彼方從事彼方法律所不禁止之商務，製造，加工，科學，敎育，宗敎及慈善事業，並亦受國民待遇，但此項權利僅得以個人身份享受之不得組織法人及團體以享受上述國民待遇。至於外國法人及團體，依該約第三條，雖在大體上得享受國民待遇，但法律另有規定時，則不適用，因之，締約任何一方，仍得予本其國法人及本國團體以若干必要之特殊待遇，此與我國新公司法第二百九十七條之規定完全一致。</p>
<p>（三）關於雙方在彼此領土內採礦權之保留——該約第五條規定，倘締約此方，將米如以關於其領土內礦產資源之採勘及開發之權利，給予任何第三國國民，法人或團體時，則此項權利，亦應依照有關法律規章，給予諦約彼方國民法人或團體。查此項規定，完全係一種假定，締約任何一方，均保有不以任何採礦權給予外國之權利，故對方亦無須享受此項權利。又該條約文中列入「將來」兩字，特別表示在本約生效前，締約任何一方，即使已給予第三國以此項權利，締約他方亦不能援例要求。</p>
<p>（四）關於雙方取得與處分不動產之保留——該約第八條第一款規定，兩國人民在被此境內，依照當地法律規章所規定之手續與條件，享有取得與處分不動產之權利，並享受與第三國國民同樣之待遇，此項規定，完全根據於平等互惠原則，並爲當地國家有關地政之立法，保留充分之自由。</p>
<p>（五）關於版權之保留——第九條規定，締約此方國民，法人及團體之發明商標及版權等，在彼方傾土內，應受有效之保護，不得仿造，使用或翻即。按各國視版權與其他所有權同等重要，其他所有權旣不能任人侵犯，則版權亦然，著作物之翻印，爲世界各界所一致禁止，幾無例外，我國「著作權法」亦明文禁止，在此方面，中外人士之著作物，自應享受同等待遇。至於美國報章雜誌——書籍，偶爲我國作家或報紙所徵引，幷不致發生如一般人所顧　之　難，因依照該約規定，版權之保護，以業經向我國官廳依法註册之著作爲限，其未依此種手續註册者，並不在本約保護之內，且按照我國「著作權法」對於他人著作之偶而節錄引用，以作自己著作之參證注釋者，並不以侵害他人著作權論。但其尤要者，爲我方對於翻譯權之保留，我方在談判時，曾對美方明白表示，由於中美兩國文字之廻異，美國著作物之漢文翻譯，不僅不致妨礙原著在華之銷路，且有時反足使讀者購置原著以資參證，並爲溝通中美兩國之文化起見，亦實有鼓勵漢文繙譯之必要，美方對我此種見解，表示同情，遂同意將原草案中不許繙譯字樣刪去，並徇我方要求，在議定書中，特別聲明，如此方法律對於本國國民，法人及團體不給予禁止繙譯之保護時，則對彼方國民，法人及團體，亦無須給予此項保護。查現行我國「著作權法」，旣不禁止繙譯，則我國人士，仍得繙譯美國所出版之任何著作物，不受著作人之任何限制。</p>
<p>（六）關於雙方國民設立學校之權利——我方對於海外華僑敎育，向極重視，以往我與各國所訂之條約中，常將華僑設立學校之權利列入約文，俾獲得條約之保障，中美商約第十二條中，亦特別規定雙方國民得在彼此領土內，設立學校以敎育其子女，其唯一限制，爲此項敎育事業，必須無背於公共道德，並須依照當地有關法律規章辦理之，此於雙方管制外國學校，實有必要。</p>
<p>（七）關於雙方貨物之進出口關稅及其銷售等之待遇——關於雙方貨物之進出口關稅，第十六條規定應享受與第三國同樣之待遇，此不獨與我國現行徵收關稅辦法相合，亦爲世界各國之通例，其於締約雙方之關稅自主原則，毫無影饗，因爲關於關稅稅率以及貨物進出口之禁止與限制等事，均不受任何約束，雙方保有完全決定之權，因之中美商約，並不妨礙我國將來可能採取之任何關稅政策，此點深願國人特別注意。至於貨物入境後，其銷售，分配，使用等項，亦祇能享受與第三國同樣之待過，並不享有國民待過，因之我國於此，如對本國貨物有加以優待之必要，亦不受條約之任何限制。</p>
<p>（八）關於雙方船舶航行之範圍——中美商約簽訂後，航業界深以美國船舶，將航行至我國各處口岸爲憂，其實此係一種過慮，該約第廿一條第三款中明白規定，締約此方之船舶，僅能裝載貨物前往彼方對外國商務及航業開放之一切口岸地方及領海，故締約任何一方，均得決定何者開放及何者不開放，其權操之在己，凡不開放之口岸，外國船舶，自不許任意載貨駛入，故此項航行範圍之限制，亦係爲本國利益而作之一種保留。</p>
<p>（九）關於沿海貿易及內河航行權之保留——第廿四條第二款，關於沿海貿易及內河航行權保留之規定，與一九三四年中美新約換文之文字相同，論者以爲該項權利之保留，旣已見諸中美新約，則無須在商約中重復規定，殊不知此次所訂者，係一整個通商航海條約故依例將有關沿海貿易及內河航行事項一概列入。又我方對沿海貿易及內河航行權之必要保留，由本國國民享有一點，向所堅持，故不獨對此項權利愼重規定，並主張在約中訂明締約任何一方與其所屬島嶼或領土間之貿易，亦應視爲沿海貿易，在此意義之下，則我國本部與台灣或與海南島間之貿易，自可禁止外人經營。</p>
<p>（十）關於美國片面之保留問題——第廿六條第四款規定，該約各條款，於　國及其領地或屬地或巴拿馬運　區間，所相互給予，或　國及其領土或屬地，或巴拿馬運河區，對古巴或菲律賓所給予之優惠，概不適用。論者認爲此係美方之片面保留，對我不利，實則美與其他各國所訂商約中均有此項規定，蓋美與古巴菲律賓有特殊條約關係，我如欲較其他任何國獲取更優之條件，殊不可能，但我國待遇不得次於其他任何國一層，則經議定書第十項明白規定，如美方將前項特殊優惠，給予任何他國時，亦應同樣給予我國。</p>
<p>（十一）關於該約之替代舊約——第二十九條第一款規定，本約一經生效應即替代中美間舊約中尙未廢止之各條款，查此項舊約，均係中美間以往之不平商約，如無此項新商約之訂立，我國仍須受其拘束。</p>
<p>（十二）關於該約之有效時期——由於國際間之商務關係，　息萬變，故　美商約之有效時期，僅規定五年，在五年屆滿前一年，締約任何「方可通知彼方廢止，故屆時我儘可視該約實施之情形如何，以決定其應否繼續或條改。</p>
<p>最惠國條款之意義——最後關於最惠國條款之意義，願予以解釋：所謂最車國待遇，實則爲與第三國之平等待遇，此爲我國歷年來在外交上所力爭之原則，我旣不願在美華僑遭受低於其他國家國民所受之待遇，則我當亦不應對在華之美僑予以不平等之待過，以往最惠國條款，誠然有其流弊，其原因實由於不平等條約之存在與片面最事國條款之規定，以及若干保留之條款之不存在。</p>
<p>由於以上說明，竊以爲讀者當不難給予中美商約以正確之判斷，其他代替舊商約之新約。尙待續訂，我政府當必一本上述三項指導原則，繼續審愼從事，以副國人之期待。</p>

<h3>新商約之不同批評　美商認有利於我　美國會將於明正討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕中美新商約華人批評者多謂其有利於美國，而不利於中國，此說爲美國商界所不能接受。美商多數意見，均與華人相反，謂此約實過份有利於中國，即如版權與專利權等，在商約中均未與以充分注意，而美國人謀在中國經商者，則認爲異常重要。就大體言，注意對華貿易之美國人皆稱，商約目的在給與兩國以平等權利，但在中國現狀之下，實際僅有利於中國。新約在發生效力之前，尙須經由兩國政府批准。美國會在一月初開會後，即可討論此約，先由衆院委會公同審查，然後送交參院核准。預料此約當可由國會通過，不致遭受劇烈反對。</p>
<h3>香港走私問題嚴重　爲我實施修正貿易辦法之成敗關鍵　央行稽核處長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行稽核處處長李立俠氏，於本月十九日，偕同該行業務局局長林鳳苞，總稅務署稅務司錢宗啓等一行飛粵，在廣州香港兩地，均曾小作勾留，調查兩地金副經濟貿易情形頗詳，業於前日六時返抵本市。記者當往訪問此行經過，承李處長語記者：政府此次頒行修正進出口貿易辦法，其實施之成敗得失關鍵，與香港走私問題之解決，實有甚切之關係；否則，如修正貿易辦法施行愈嚴，香港之走私情形勢必更形猖獗。如走私問題一日獲得解決，則僑匯資金之逃避問題，亦同可獲解決。</p>
<p>僑滙集港</p>
<p>李氏旋指出解決香港走私問題之辦法三端：（一）應加强海關之緝私工作：（二）地方當局及軍警，應通力協助緝私；（三）獲取香港政府之合作。李氏稱：粵閩兩省，以海岸綫頗長，海關緝私力量，極爲薄弱，實非儘量加强不可，地方當局之合作，亦屬必要。香港政府，尤須積極合作；否則消極協助，仍足助長走私之風。渠除信香港政府可能推誠合作，蓋依長期之趨勢觀之，香港之繁榮，實與內地經濟之盛衰，息息相關。</p>
<p>僑滙集港</p>
<p>在我國之僑滙上言：香港近已成爲南洋及美洲方面僑匯之轉匯點，由此再分匯粵閩各地。設我國能控制僑匯數字，則亦將有助於修正貿易辦法之施行。戰前我國每年僑匯總額，約爲美金一萬三四千萬元，戰後南洋僑匯雖减少，惟美洲僑匯劇增，故總額仍未見减少。惟香港僑匯之內匯，大多係由港粵兩地之銀號經手。廣州之銀號，共分銀號，我換，錢合三種，加入公會者，共達八十六家，然經財部核發執照者，僅十一家，合乎財部規定者，亦僅二三十家，此外，普通商業銀行，亦有十五家。此次曾召集廣州銀錢業談話，分囑多多與國家合作，並指示三點：（一）港交國幣匯款，足以助長資金逃避應先經中央銀行許可；（三）各銀號收購之外匯頭寸，應結售予中央銀行。現未經指定經營外匯之銀行，及未領得經營外幣交易許可執照之銀號等，正向中央銀行申請證件，以便取得合法地位。</p>
<p>粵港市面</p>
<p>廣州之出口數字不大，惟將來湖南，江西等處所產之　，桐油，生絲等，將自此地出口。廣州市面，目前頗呈蕭條息較滬爲低，故資金大批匯市面銀根素俏，該地金融界，亟望中央銀行能設法制止。</p>
<p>反觀香港，復員工作進行順利，殆已完成十之七，金融情形穩定，利息奇廉，活存竟無息，定存二厘，放款僅六厘；物價亦平，一般均看跌。利息低，開支省，上海遂有許多工業家前去視察，多有在該地設廠之準備。港地限價綦嚴，衣食住行，均有限價，執行亦頗澈底。英國之呢絨疋頭，較滬低廉三成至五成不等，美貨則未見有如滬市之暢銷。港地華商銀行共廿五家，惟大多不能作充份之發展。香港政府對外匯，表面雖未統制，惟匯豐銀行常從中調度，僑滙更常被大量科用。香港官價美金，爲港幣四元對美金一元，然黑市美金，每元爲港幣四元六角。</p>
<p>粵港金價</p>
<p>至言金價，粵港兩地，均較滬低廉，廣州較滬廉百分之四，香港較滬廉百分之十。兩地金價，每兩約合法幣二十七萬元，惟係用老秤。現廣州每日之成交額，約在萬兩以上，多係自香港走私而來，每日約到三千兩云。</p>
<p>林鳳苞談</p>
<p>又據林鳳苞氏對記者發表此行談話稱：輸入臨時管理委員會，以廣州密邇港澳，情形特殊，爲免因頒布新章，商業停頓起見，特派本人偕同總稅務署錢稅務司宗起於十九日飛粵。迭與該地稅務司及廣州各指定銀行代表商定步驟，幷赴香港與粵海，九龍，拱北三關稅務司，多番討論，當以該處進口業務，一部份係由廣州赴港採購，而在港主動發貨往粵銷售者，亦不在少。同時舟車旅客往來於港粵間者，日以萬計，零星進口，至爲繁多。爲適應事實需要起見，不得不作權宜之計，爰經陳准輸入臨時管理委員會，暫在廣州及九龍兩地，由指定銀行及海關方面，分別貨品及限額，簽發臨時輸入許可證，以本年年底爲限，一俟各商登記吿竣，再行轉滬審查核發。本人於昨晚返滬，業將上述經過報吿該會云。</p>

<h3>首都一片銀白色　西伯利亞寒流襲來　長江下游處處飛雪</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕首都陰雨三日，廿八日侵晨　雪，至午益大　傍晚時全城一片自色，迄下午七時猶未止，此爲本年首次降雪，據悉。其原因由於西伯利亞寒流突襲結果，此股寒流，自本月廿五日始由西伯利亞自西北方向由國本部侵襲，廿七日到達長江下游，致京滬一帶溫度突降，今晨降至零度左右；至成雪原因，則係由於停留京市空之暖氣層，一與寒氣面憧，暖氣即自低空浮起，其中水氣與上層寒氣相觸，常即凝雪下降。（關於上海天氣報吿，請閱第六版）</p>

<h3>走上民主大道的有力保證</h3>
<p>—讀蔣主席演詞之後—</p>
<p>國民大會昨日舉行第三次大會，憲法草案已由蔣主席親自隆重提出，一俟討論憲草的議程決定之後，即將開始討論憲草。我們聽了蔣主席昨在國大發表的演說，益信五五憲草修正案，必能在國大獲得大多數代表的同意而予以通過；蔣主席的演詞要點有三：（一）五權憲法是世界上最新的最進步的憲法，但我國人民尙不能行使政權；故五五憲草不切實際。不能適用。（二）五權憲法的精神，乃在「權」與「能」的劃分，當政的人行使治權，一定要站在人民的立塲，爲行使政權者着想；否則就容易變成集權制。（三）憲法貴在實行，對於五五憲草修正案，匪特表示贊成，抑且竭誠希望國大能予以通過。蔣主席以一個在朝執政的國民黨總裁而有此「天下爲公」的大度，實在中國走上民主大道的最有力的保證。</p>
<p>國民黨的代表，雖有小部份，曾堅持國父五權憲法的精義而對於五五憲草修正案表示異議的異議但是經過蔣主席一再剴切說明之後，自能捐棄成見，顧全現實，接受這部依照政協決議而擬成的五五憲草修正案，殆無疑義。靑年黨代表也於昨日向國大宣佈，該黨代表「當盡心竭力參加討論，促成此一現代化而爲全國人民所需要之完美憲法獲得制定完成」。至於民主社會黨，則早已以通過此項憲草修正案爲參加國大的條件，擁護此項憲草，自不待言，此在社會賢達，也是沒有問題的。除此而外，所餘僅眞正民選的代表，他們雖然視政協爲黨派會議，不願受共決議的拘束，蔣主席於答覆代表詢問時，也曾宣佈：國大不受政協決議的拘束；但是民選代表不能不顧及國內現實，何况民選代表在抗戰以前，早已產生，時隔八九年，是否仍能代表民意，似乎不免有些問題。我們若以政治學的理論來權衡五五憲草及其修正案，則我們不能不說修正案已有相當進步。民選代表絕無反對的理由。</p>
<p>蔣主席說：『今日所提出的這部憲法草案，可以說是五十年來全國軍民先烈血淚鑄成的。本席今天代表政府提出這個草案，同時想到將來憲法制定以後，對於國家的治亂與民族的盛衰，關係至爲重大，因此不能不披瀝眞誠，今天國民政府將憲法草案提交國民大會以後，可以說政府已經移國家的責任交與全國人民了。從今天起，全國人民就要開始担負這個重大的責任』這一番充滿了熱情的肺腑之言，足以感召每一個眞正愛國的人民，而不得不欽佩蔣主席所有政治家的風度。爲任何人所不及。緣自國民大會於十五日開幕以來，中共民盟匪特堅決拒不參加，並千方百計，橫加破壞，不是說國大爲國民黨一黨包辦的國大，就是說政府召開國大將政協決議破壞無遺。但是看了國大開會的情形，再聽了蔣主席的演稅，就可以知道中共所稱各節非誣即妄；國民黨決心還政於民，自然沒有包辦國大的必要。蔣主席爲確保憲草修正案經由國大通過起見，不知費了多少唇舌，剴切曉喩國大代表，顧全事實，捐棄成見。接受這部依照政協決議所擬就的憲軍，所謂事實勝於雄辯，究底是誰破壞政協？也是不言可知的。至於外國報紙的評論國大，因爲外人不甚瞭解我國政治的實際情形，不免隔靴抓癢，更無一辯的價値。</p>
<p>要之，蔣主席雖爲國民黨的總裁，但有天下爲公的大度，絕無黨派的成見，這是我國走上民主大道的有力保證；在其　導之下的國民黨，也有一種新政黨在醞釀之中，就是彼此尊重，互相容讓。預料憲草修正案，必能獲得國大的通過，已是沒有問題的了。這實在可以視爲我國政局從此開朗的徵兆，凡馬與會的國大代表，對於制憲工作，尤應從大處落墨，能見其大，務使國大早日完成其制憲工作。全國四舊五千萬的人民，　首南京，時時刻刻矚望國大制憲順利，能有美滿的收穫。國大代表旣受人民的重託，自應處處以民意爲依歸。對於蔣主席昨天的演　，尤應再三思之。切實遵行。</p>

<p>日間路燈何以不熄</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>地這節電聲中，經吳市長親自零導勸吿，大多數商民，已遵守實行了。</p>
<p>今日鄙人於早上九時，偶然抬頭看見金陵路燈，仍舊開着，當時以爲時間尙早，故而未關，不料直到晚上止，仍續下去。想起本店深恐受罰，故而減少燈光，對於營業的影響，當然可觀，然亦是迫不得已。像這種浩大無用的損失，不知也可以來節省一下嗎？（徐米生）</p>
<p>抗議公用事業狂漲</p>
<p>「巧婦難爲無米之炊」。在量出爲入的原則下，凡百事業，價漲得會理，不獨不應反對，反該熱烈的擁護，那事業才有發展的希望。這次公用事業的漲價，不漲則已，一漲驚人，漲出了情理之外，使我們小市民不得不大呌：「吃不消了。」</p>
<p>老西門到曹家渡的公共汽車，在市參議會中，減爲三百元，現在漲爲六百元。當時的物價，較現在不過漲了幾成，並沒有加倍，獨車費倍增，未識依據了什麼計算？據說：公營事業之盈利，歸之市庫，取之於民，用之於民，這情諒；但市輪渡則如何？</p>
<p>水上飯店至高廟，在戰前爲一角，現漲爲九百元，（報載於十一月二十五日起漲價，實際已漲了一星期期多了，漢令似乎等於零，　使我們小百姓莫明其妙。）較之生活指數將近加倍，市輪渡改官商合辦，已成，徒爲商人謀暴利，太說不過去！然楚人失弓論；再以無思電車來說罷。</p>
<p>靜安寺到中山公園的無軌電車，在戰前決不滿三分，現在漲爲三百元，不啻漲了萬倍有奇，電車公司是英商，一定也要呌英國，狂發我們小市民的財，這將從何說起？</p>
<p>本市淪陷時代，每一次「平價」，多不合理；不信現在靑天白日下面，還有像這樣不合理的漲價。我們小市民已如驚弓之鳥，有些凰惑起來，請當局給我們以合理的解釋！（張美梅）</p>
<p>（編者按）同時收到龍華讀者計永其君函稱：「我們是住在龍華的通學生，向來是自着風雨步行的；適本月十八日我們放學回家，見市公共汽車已行駛該路，所以高人程很。然而票價太不合理，不論近遠一律千元。如此又受到了一個重大的打擊！不！龍華的市民也負撥着一切的捐稅，福利方面爲何受不到市區與區一樣的待遇？我們希望市政當局注意此種不合理的票價，應當以路途近遠計算，這才是龍華的市民的要求。」再牛農對泣愚園路沈桐君亦有同樣呼聲，一併刊登。</p>
<p>爲浚河收費質疑</p>
<p>昨日敝保（浦東北區）保長云泰市政府命令開浚王家浜河道，經費按田徵收每畝五千元，實難索解。按市府開竣河道，何獨先從此長不足四華里，闊僅三四丈之小河開始。如謂有關國防或是交通要道，當由士工商等人民一體負擔，如關農稼水利，則籌募經養未可以一職爲限，宜在該河流域地帶募收，方爲合理。再者　鄕方盛行迎種賽會，何不以引項花費，充作竣河之　？請保長注意及之！（黃福庭）</p>

<h3>四强重要爭點成立協議　五國和約即可簽字　連日秘密外交意外收穫</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿八日電〕四外長昨夜再度舉行秘密會議，已就各重要爭點成立協議，秘密會議似已產生良好結果。觀察家希望和平條約或可於合理的時期內簽字。會議席上對於義大利　約，尤其是特港地位問題成立之協議如下：</p>
<p>（一）「駐軍期限」特港自由城總督就職後幾十日內，即國駐軍歸其簡制，之後「盟軍將在三十至四十五日之期內撤退，但總督認爲必要時，軍隊得繼續留駐。（二）「臨　政府參議會之組織」總督一職由安理會與義南兩國諮詢後任命之。總督於徵詢　南兩國童見後，在特港居民中任命臨時政府參議會議員。（三）「選舉期限」特港之選舉，最遲於總督就任後四個月舉行之。自比際以至彼時，仍由軍政府行施權力，英美及南斯拉夫軍隊各留現駐區域。</p>
<p>此外，關於義國賠償問題之最惠國條款，民用航空·以及舉行國際會議以調查多瑙河自由航運之可能性等，亦均成立協議四外長代表定本日午後四時開會，擬訂昨日協議之最後草約。</p>

<h3>各國國內外軍隊　將同時予以調查　聯大政治委員會通過英提案　蘇聯遭遇三重失敗</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿七日電〕聯大政治及安全委會今日開會時，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫遭遇三重失敗。第一，該會採納蘇聯所提各聯合國於明年一月一日公佈國外駐軍數目之建議，但將該提案修正爲各國應同時將國內所有軍險數目一併公佈，莫氏雖竭力反對，卒獲通過。第二，莫氏要求委員會採納埃及所提非敵性國內所駐英軍除特殊情形外，應一律立即撤退之建議，亦吿失敗，第三，莫氏擬強迫美英兩國於明年一月一日公佈其所有原子彈。火箭及其他秘密武器之數目，但委員會對此建議，甚至拒絕提付表決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿七日電〕聯大政治委會今日以四十票對十票，通過英國提案，規定普遍調查世界各國國外駐軍，蘇聯猛烈反對無效。蘇聯主張調查僅應以國外駐軍爲限，國內軍隊可在將來討論裁軍問題時涉及。同時該委會對於蘇聯要求調查一切秘密武器如原子彈及火箭等則予以否決。先是，委員會主席烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基曾二次企圖提出蘇聯之軍備調查案，當即引起一塲激辯。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫亦企岡阻止英國提案付表決，欲在其中加入「及國內可供使用之軍備」字樣，該修正案被廿四票對十八票否決，美國提議修正英國提案，刪除「聯合國安理會派遣監察幽實地覆核」字樣，委員會予以表決通過。蘇聯旋提議「安理會討論裁軍問題時，各國應將國內軍隊及軍備情形，報吿安理會，」委員會又以卅一票對十票予以否決。軍隊調查案雖尙待大會最後表決，但今日委員會表決結果，當不致被推翻。委員會最後以廿九票對十三票，否決埃及臨時動議。埃及提案主張大會應通吿會員各國，凡有軍隊駐紥在其他會員國境內者應立即撤退，僅聯合國憲章規定者除外。美代表稱此案必須從長計議，獨蘇聯表示擁護。委員會旋宣吿休會至星期四。</p>
<h3>美願發表陸軍數字</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕據權威方面息：聯合國機構如通過各國宣佈其國內外軍隊實數之提案，則美陸軍部準備並極願發表此項數字。官方人士指出，美陸軍數字多少爲世界所知悉，因美國實行民主制度，軍費必須由國會通過，故軍隊實數無從掩蔽。例如美陸軍人數在本年底將達一百三十萬人，但至一九四七年六月將减至一百零七萬人，此固爲世人所皆知者，至國外駐軍數目雖未公佈，但由報章記載加以計算，亦可得相當正確之約數。</p>
<h3>前日本委治島　美擬單獨管理</h3>
<p>社勒斯在託管會宣稱</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖廿七日電〕聯大託管委會本日舉行會議，由美代表社勒斯發言稱，美國在聯合國機構未曾制定一有效的集體安全制度以前，拒絕將其在託管地區所有陸海軍基地解除軍備，但爲欲使託管地區內基地解除軍備起見，吾人必須造成能保證安全之情形，質言之，即軍事參謀委曾及原子能委會均能確定有效方法，以管制軍備，同時安理會又能避免因行使否決權而造成之普遍半身不遂狀態是也。要之美國擬單獨託管太平洋前日本代管島嶼，而在各該島嶼均有空海軍基地。至此，紐西蘭代表起立發言稱，紐西蘭就其代管地薩摩亞島所提出之託管協定草案，業經蘇聯提議予以修正，蘇聯之修正案若果獲得通過，則紐西蘭將收回此項託管協定草案，且在必要時，將不徵得聯合國機構之同意，而繼續管制蓀摩亞烏，依照蘇聯所提出之修正案，主張託管地區內之軍略地區應交由安理會管制，託管國家無權自行指定軍略地區。</p>
<h3>我建議設委會接辦國際救濟</h3>
<p>美提三項具體辦法</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖廿七日電〕聯大經濟財政委會本日開會，討論由國代表所提出之建議，即主張在聯總解散後，應設立一國際委員會，負責分配救濟物資與所需各國，完全基於救濟性質，而不應顧慮及政治上之理由。美代表亦提出建議，力言尙有若十鼠家在聯總撤銷之後，應在金融上予以援助，俾向外國購買食物，其具優辦法有三：（一）由聯全國大會請秘書處將所需救濟物資之淸單，分送國　委員會所有各會員國；（二）請求各會。國於來年中，竭盡其所能，捐助救濟物資；（三）邀請捐助救濟物資之各會員國，調整其救濟程序。</p>

<h3>皮杜爾內閣辭職　共黨推領袖陶萊士繼任總理</h3>
<p>〔法萬新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕皮杜爾內閣今日在國　　會開幕式中提出辭呈，共產黨已推荐陶萊土爲總理繼任人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕法國內閣舉行會議，首由臨時總統兼內閣總理曁外長皮社爾宣讀內閣辭　書，擬於明日送達國民大會議長’農即由海外部長草戴報吿在越南所採取之政策，皮杜爾總統亦表示贊成，未經討論即由內閣會議予以通過。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕法國新　國民議會今日開幕時，共黨正式宣布要求取得內閣總理一席。皮杜爾內閣之辭　，僅爲一種公式，因新國會召開時，政府往往辭職，故非意外舉動。新政府在明年一月第四共和國首屆總統選出以前，不致就任。共黨反對皮杜爾內閣留任爲保管政府，頗引起震動。共黨中央委員會在議會開幕前，決定立即行動，推舉黨魁陶萊土爲內閣總理；決議案中要求組織「民主聯合政府，由共產黨主持，以便執行國家復興，社會進步，民主復活與法國獨立之政策。」共黨秘書長杜克濟宣稱：共黨政綱志在革新工業，復興農業及統制對外貿易。陶萊士本人則力言當前最大問題乃在增加生產，改善大衆之生活標準。議會休息室人士對共黨在議會獲得多數票之機會，表示懷疑，因共黨在議會六百十五席中，僅佔一百八十三席；其他各黨與共黨不合作，固已毋論，甚至社會黨是否支持六成問題。但僅就共黨推舉黨魁出任總理一事以觀，已迫使議會分化。共黨此舉之最大目標，殆欲使社會黨陷於進退維谷之境。大多數人士預料皮杜爾或可獲得多數票，而留任總理，縱使共黨反對，亦未必動搖。皮杜爾領導之人民共和黨多數黨員，不僅反對共黨出任總理，甚至反對共黨參加內閣，固爲事實；但一般預料皮社爾倘再度當選總理，自當羅致共黨入閣。共黨雖因不能取得總理一席而失望，似極有加以接受之可能云。</p>

<h3>魯易斯應傳出庭　法官寬限十日令即制止工潮　煤斤缺乏戰時燈火管制恢復</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕　聯會主席魯易斯被控　視法庭命令罪，開審時遭法官嚴詞呵斥，故就今日情形觀之，魯氏欲求開脫此項指責，頗爲困難。聯邦法院今日因感因簡休假，然當局與魯氏之初步接觸，顯然不利於魯氏之聲辯。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十七日電〕烟煤礦罷工對美國工業加緊窒息之際，礦聯會主席魯易斯今日由聯邦法官高爾斯勃魯開庭審訊。高氏指責魯氏蔑視禁令，拒絕維持礦工與礦主間現邦法官對煤礦罷工是否有權發出禁令，亦將於明後日裁定。工會律師當庭辯稱：「限制法院發出禁令法」限制法院向勞資糾紛發出禁令，故高氏向魯易斯所發禁令不能生效。法官答稱：限制法院發出禁令法」如敵用於此案，則或可無須陪審。工潮已使鋼鐵，鐵路及河道運輸工人八尤名賦閒。全國多數城市已恢復戰時之燈火管制。政府經濟家則警告各大都市糧食不免發生恐慌。某經濟家稱：罷工三月，禍害不堪設想。多數學校藉口無煤，相率延長感恩節假期數日。學校之停課不盡由於煤礦工潮，例如明凡索達州聖保羅城，老師罷教要求加薪，學校因而關閉，若干區學生則在無綫電中繼續受課。全國廣播協會會長密勒已通告各電臺，在學校關閉區域，廣播日常學校節目。</p>
<p>魯氏律師辯稱　罷工係出自動</p>
<p>礦工罷工人數約四十萬人用煤工業工人受其影響者則達一百九十萬人。。農業部一再警吿：罷工祗須延長二十日，鐵路運輸停頓，各城市即有糧荒之虞。東部各地居民，無煤生火，惟有加厚衣服取暖。一星期內該方面將有二十萬人賦閑。多數工廠尤其是鋼鐵廠正日益减工，美國　鐵公司下星期將宣布關閑一部份工廠，大小工業預料下星期將開始停工。賓夕爾法尼亞，西林吉尼亞及俄亥俄三州工業區影響最重，一星期內將有賦閑工人十萬名；伊利諾州十日內亦將有賦閑工人十萬名。汽車工業尙未受嚴重影響，但亦決定延長感恩節假期至下星期一，以資節省用煤。</p>
<p>魯氏律師辯稱　罷工係出自動</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓二十七日電〕聯邦法庭法官高爾斯勃魯已決定再予魯易斯十日期限，令其制止工潮。又悉：魯易斯「被吿辯護入聲稱：會員礦工決定罷工，因彼等認爲所有條件難以忍受，並非由於工會領袖所鼓動。魯易斯旣米破壞法律，亦未　視法令，本案應即撤消云。旋經辯護人與檢察長討論一過後，法庭決定退庭，至廿八日再審。</p>

<h3>日首相表明態度　謂深知經濟危機盼社會黨協力　欲經濟復興尙需美國方面援助</h3>

<h3>印政府改組經過（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐印記者周祥光</p>
<p>（印度德里十一月四日航訊）人類和平，民族自決此乃二十世紀開明民族一致的呼聲。當然，印度具有四萬萬的人口，且又係東方古國，自不能讓其屈服於外人統治之下，應有自主的地位；是以英國工黨組閣以來，即已看到此點，欲將政權逐漸交還印度，使印度於十年或甚至五年以內，達到完全自由獨立的地位。是誠極高明之政策，將在英國殖民史上寫下光輝的一頁。因此今年二月間英工黨內閣乃派印度事務大臣勞倫斯，海軍大臣亞歷山大及商務大臣克里浦斯到印，和印度各政黨領袖談判印度獨立問題，爲時數月，最後發表宣言，促國大黨及回盟共同組閣。</p>
<p>當時對國回原欲共同組織中央臨時政府，但不久國大黨却不願參加，而願加入制憲議會，而回盟又不能組閣，兩黨組府事，遂蕪形流產。惟工黨政府感覺此事之不能成功，終非善策，遂令印督魏菲爾促由國大黨單獨出來組府。回盟感覺英人有出賣回盟之處，乃召開中央執行會議，宣布取消前議，即回盟旣不參加政府，亦不加入制憲議會，更決定於八月十六日爲回盟直接行動日，以與國大黨示威反抗。</p>
<p>果自八月十六日起，至十九日止，加城大屠殺的慘劇就發生了。綜計印回兩敎死傷人數達一萬五千人以上，誠歷史上一大刦。其時，記者尙在加城，目賭斯景，老弱婦孺亦不能免利斧砍死，鼻爲之酸。自此以後，印度政局的低氣壓，瀰漫到全印每一角落，無論中外人士，眼見原是無限光明的印度獨立運動，突然來了一度意外的陰影，莫不惋惜不置，沉悶欲絕。迄九月二日，國大黨主席尼赫魯因不能獲得回盟同意，共同組閣，乃逕自組府，爲印度獨立自由而奮鬥。回盟人士認爲尼氏此舉，乃印度敎帝國主義的表現，欲將一萬萬回民，置於印度敎統治之下，爲表示反抗起見，乃訓令全印回敎徒於新政府成立日，懸掛黑旗，以示此日爲印度歷史上最黑暗的日子，但尼赫魯終將新政府組成了。</p>
<p>英屬印度數省內閣操在回盟手中，且各地騷動繼續發生，如孟買。達卡等處，中央政府雖成立，其權力不及於地方，惟求境內安全與夫兩黨團給合作起見，回盟必須參加政府，方有力量。至十月初，印督魏菲爾遂邀請回盟領袖眞納到德里談判，果然眞納亦於月初從孟買偕其女公子乘船到此，和平空氣一時乃又復瀰漫全印各地焉。</p>
<p>眞納到德里後，與魏菲爾總督晤談四次。嗣後，總督飛往他處視察，印　談判問題，遂由蒲浦土邦王公從中奔走，蓋蒲浦爾土邦王公爲印度王公議會議長，亦一回敎徒，因此關係，故與印回兩方容易接近，幾經斡旋，爲時一週，自晨至晚，未嘗休息。但談判終無協議，一因眞納要求「巴基斯坦」（編者按：即印回分治之意）二則回盟堅持要代表全體回敎徒。國大黨方面，認此兩點，俱不能接受，蓋成立巴基斯坦等於分裂印度爲兩個國家，直根據最近普選，回盟代表並未全部中選，而屬於國大黨之回敎徒，却有一部份獲選，故認回盟無權代表全體回敎徒。時在十月十一日，兩黨談判遂吿完全失敗。</p>
<p>迄十月十三日，眞納以兩黨談判旣經失敗，即自行晋謁魏菲爾說明商談不必經兩黨協議，回盟仍可舉出五名代表，參加臨時中央政府。眞納回寓，即召集執委開會討論。此次回盟竟毅然參加新政府，據加爾各答「印度明星報」（回盟報紙）評論稱：回盟可能不願與國大黨有何協定，即自行決定加入新政府。如此，則回盟不必犧牲其根本要求及主張，且不必承認國大黨的要求。此種辦法，對回盟有利無書，或對新政府中巴合爾（現任內政部長兼宣部傳長）之獨裁，加以限制。對回盟領袖信件之受檢查，或能加以制止，使回敎民族爭取巴基斯坦之奮鬥，免受阻碍」。</p>
<p>加爾各答印度敎徒所辦之「印度萬歲晚報」，對回盟逕自參加新政府而不與國大黨協商，同時曾作評論如次：「印度人口中，印度敎徒佔百分之七十五，照新政府各方代表名額分配，在國大黨所得之六席中，回敎徒一人，　民階級一人，其餘四席歸印度敎徒。但全印人口中，回敎徒祇見百分之二十五，回盟的回敎代表竟佔五席；加上國大黨名額中的非屬於回盟的回敎代表六人，則全印回敎徒實得六席。這時多數民族的印度敎徒未免不公平，可是尙不能使回盟滿足。據悉：爾黨談判雖失敗，回盟却仍決定入閣，以享受其利益。是否有何動機？不得而知。回盟是否想進去搗亂，製造僵局，及對國大黨所擬進行善政加以怠工？是否陰謀促成總督干政？使世人認爲過渡時期中，英國未將政權交還印人？回盟大概希望借助邱吉爾集團及留印反動英人之力量，以阻撓印度向自由之路前進。」</p>
<p>印度西北邊省的回敎領袖格發可汗，雖係回敎徒，但終身追隨甘地，故印人稱之爲邊疆甘地，以示尊崇之意。渠認　盟之參政，乃總督魏菲爾之圈套。略謂：「　盟領袖不與國大黨獲致解決，而反與總督私行解決，殊屬可憾。蓋總督發覺國大黨在新政府中代表，行動一致，總督似已陷於窘境。因此，自然的轉向其老友回盟，予以相救。」</p>
<h3>改進我國農業建議包含四點　赫契生送呈杜魯門</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日合衆電〕美加利福尼亞大學農學院長赫契生，頃以赴華農業考察團改進中國農業之建議書一份，送呈杜魯門。其後渠對美農部官員談話時，並言及建議書內容，據稱，渠於離華前，曾以報吿數份分別提交中國若干高級官員司徒大使及馬歇爾。渠表示中國政府如能積極振作，實行堅强之農業計劃，則其國內大部份之不安局面，必能漸越平靜，蓋中國之不安。大多係出諸農村區域。赫氏甚讚中國農民之良善，但稱，彼等尙須在多方面有所改善。渠特別建議四點：（一）擴大應用業已改進之作物品種；（二）大量應用化學肥料，而少用目前之有機肥料；（三）設法預防害虫與動植物疾病；（四）發展灌溉，渠最後稱，中國甚需促進其敎育，其目前之農業敎育基爲落後，是以不足應付大量人民之需要。又稱，該團曾建議由國政府應制止人口迅速上增趨勢。繼稱。據中國商業界巨　稱中國目前之資源，足够支持二億以上人民之生活。渠則以爲除非中國經由敎育方法，將此項觀念予以改變，則必將繼續遭受苦難。</p>

<h3>新稅增繁糾紛日多　亟待評定各項爭議及改進稽征手續　稅捐評議會將召開會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府爲實施稅捐簡化稽征手續，特由財政局組設稅捐評護委員會，業經最近市政會議通過，其會之組織由市府代表一人，財政局局長或副局長，社會局代表一人，財政局稅捐主管科長，市商會代表一人，相關同業公會代表二人，市參議會代表一人，指定會計師一人，共同組織而成。現財政局鑒於新稅增繁，尤以市政建設捐房捐等糾紛日多，有待召集評議會之必要，特於日昨函知各有關機關團體，請速推選代表報會，以便集議。茲悉該會會議之　圍如下：（一）評定納稅人應否免征稅捐，（二）評定納稅人之營業資本額，（三）評定納稅人之營業總收入額，（四）評定納稅人　期應納之稅額，（五）評定關於稅捐之各項爭議，（六）評定關於各種稅捐章　規定之應否移送法院事件，（七）建議改進稅捐征收手續，（八）其他依各種稅捐章則規定，得付評議或審查之事件。</p>

<h3>本月份市稅增加　較上月份多收入三十億元　屠宰稅下月起亦調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市財政局本月份之稅收，截至昨日爲止，已達法幣一百十億元，較上月份全月增加三十億元。此係由於開徵市政建設捐，及筵席捐與娛樂捐增加之故。</p>
<p>由於物價騰漲，屠宰稅將自十二月份起調整。新價目如下：牛每頭徵一萬元（舊稅額爲九千一百元），猪每隻徵八千元（舊稅額每隻爲五千六百元）。業經市參議會備案，並由市政府核定。屠宰稅原係從價徵收百分之五，因肉類價格經常變動，故按最低批　價計算，隔相當時期調整一次。最近肉價不斷上漲，屠宰稅額，亦應提高。據財政局副局長胡又元氏吿記者稱：此次所訂稅額標準，較最低批發價尙低。</p>
<p>秋季市政建設捐自開徵以來，正　極推進中，下月份所收當可較多，估計可達三十億元。至於冬季之市政建設捐，或須延至明年初徵收。全部市政建設捐與市府其他稅收劃開，純供市政建設之用。</p>
<p>機關學校·房捐照納</p>
<p>政府機關，立案學校，及純粹慈善團體所用房屋，房捐向例豁免。市參議會通過市政建設捐時，曾有「除法律另有規定外，概無豁免」一條。關於此點，最近市政府及財政局曾咨文市參議會財政組，據函復稱：「決定仍不豁免。」故上列三機關團體房屋，亦須一律繳納市政建設捐。</p>
<h3>營業稅細則十四條　市商會請酌予修改</h3>
<p>市商會爲營業稅法施行細則第十四條缺乏彈性之優點，特電呈財部請酌予修改，俾得按照業別，分級征稅，原電略云：營業稅法施行細則第十四條有「其他各業，一律就其營業總收入額徵收百分之一點五」，是未能顧及營業稅法第四條彈性之優點，堅決護持其均一稅率之成案，實出於一般工商業預計之外，羣感失望。以屬會所聞目前地方辦理稅收機關，亦深以營業稅按照業別分級徵收，最爲合理，惟因受施行細則第十四條之限制，無從辦理，爰再不惴冒昧，仰祈鈞部鑒核，俯准將營業稅法施行細則第十四條，參照戰前成案，暨現時各業請求情形，予以修改，俾收推行盡利之效」云。</p>

<p>市商會爲據財政部上海直接稅局辦理稽征第二類乙薪給報酬所得額應納方式，特轉函公會會員及會員商店知照，略謂：案准財政部上海直接稅局本月廿三日滬直二字第五〇六七號公函開，案奉財政部卅五年十一月十四日京直壹（卅五）字第一〇三七一號代電開，查機關法團或公司行號，對於員工膳宿之供給，本屬給與之一種，有併入薪給津貼，計征第二類乙項薪給報酬所得稅者，原無不當。惟以此項給與，在住宿方面，大都爲公用餘屋，在膳食方面，日供一餐兩餐，亦各不，致，謂其對於員工之福利，優待則可，稱爲固定之津貼，尙欠適常，兼之計算亦屬困難。茲爲便利稽征起見，規定嗣後各機關法團或公司行號，對於員工瞎宿之供給，於計算第一類乙項薪給報酬所得額時，免予併入計算，但其以津貼方式支給現金者，仍應合併計稅等因，即希轉飭所屬知照云云。</p>

<p>市長在江灣街頭（本報兪創碩攝）</p>
<h3>市長下鄕巡視江灣　探訪民隱會見駐軍</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕一夜寒風，不知道飄落了多少黃葉；都市的仕女是最敏感的，已經把頭縮在重裘裏面了。</p>
<p>離開這兒十餘公里以外的北郊江灣，地頻浦江，人口稀落。嚴冬在江灣，將是更深一重的威脅。——幸而，在今冬初寒的頭一天，吳市長便替他們帶來了溫暖。</p>
<p>吳市長於昨晨八時，赴江灣其美路和奎照路視察第二十一區和第二十二區。到過的地方有：米店，肉莊，理髮店，棉花舖，五金店，打鐵店，自由車行，烟紙洋火店，茶館等等。吳市長查到米店，便問：「米買多少錢一担」？查到肉莊，便問：「猪肉幾鈿一斤」？此外如剃一個頭要多少錢，一祖棉花可賺幾何，鐵店裏的學徒每個月拿多少月規錢之類，都在評細詢問之列。</p>
<h3>不識市長什麽樣　眯起花眼且打量</h3>
<p>鄕下人是多數不認得吳市長的，但是他們都聽見過市長，至少也多知道「市長」是怎麼回事兒。當茶坊店裏的一個老太婆，發現「市長」時，眯起了老花眼，骨碌碌地向吳市長全身打量，似乎一定要發掘出一點與衆不同的地方。</p>
<p>「道就是市長嗎？「全市就是他最大嗎」？許多鄉下人都這樣異口同聲的說。</p>
<p>吳市長說，他愛鄕下人，因爲唯有他們才是樸實的。他更愛鄕下孩子。</p>
<p>當吳市長踏進江灣鎭上一家自由車行的時候，老闆出去了，守店的是個鄕下小孩。吳市長撫着他的頭問：</p>
<p>「小弟弟，你呌什麽名字」？</p>
<p>「和尙」！</p>
<p>大家都給這個怪名字引笑了。他又一本正經地說：</p>
<p>「我是呌和尙呀，師父就這樣呌我的」。</p>
<p>「你今年幾歲了」？</p>
<p>「十二歲」——</p>
<p>「生意好　」？</p>
<p>「還馬馬虎虎」。</p>
<p>十二歲的孩子，是那樣的若無其事和老氣橫秋，大家又笑了。</p>
<p>隨後，區長李澄塘吿訴吳市長鄉郊區公所平時最感困難的是軍民不能合作，鄕區駐軍特多，士兵佔居民房，而老百姓向區公所哭訴的文件，每日必數起。據說有些軍隊，往往在民房門口，貼上一張紙條，甚至就拿粉筆寫上幾個字，就可以强行遷入。此外借床，借桌椅的更不可勝數。就在昨天，區公所的辦公桌上還置有一大堆老百姓的狀子。而區公所對於這種情形，也實在是覺得無能爲力，因爲他們沒有這個權。</p>
<h3>大氣磅礴洋洋偉構　追記張大千畫展　中國畫苑擠滿參觀的人　到處博得驚歎贊美之聲</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕張大千的畫展結束了。這次畫展的日期祇有短短四天，但成績之好，却是有口皆碑。中國畫苑裏擠滿了參觀的人，到處都是驚歎和贊美的聲音。</p>
<p>張氏的畫已經到了「從心所欲，不逾矩」的火候。山水固然蒼勁圓熟，當代不作第二人想；花卉也表現了無上的造詣——雙鈎是秀麗規矩，那幅墨荷中堂更是大氣磅礴，洋洋大觀。我以爲從張氏的花卉作品中，可以看出藝人「靜如處女，動如脫兔」之妙。</p>
<p>直入古人堂奧</p>
<p>但是最受人注意的當然是張氏的人物。張氏寢　敦煌寳繪，已經歷有年所，怪不得他直人占人堂奧了。你祇要細看張氏仕女的開相，佛像的衣褶和設色，人像的那一種「望之鬚髮皆動」的風致——你就看得出敦煌給他的影響來。</p>
<p>用西洋畫的眼光來看張氏的畫，就立刻會發現張氏的人像中，肢體軀幹的比例都是比較寫實的，和一般國畫中仕女必削肩蜂腰，身體又往往長得畸形，都大不相同。此外，我覺得張氏人物的姿態和臉相中的表情也很可注意：張氏筆下人物似乎是有血肉的；而有傳統的國畫中的人物，其表情却總呌我們想起了西洋中世紀時僧侶們的繪畫，張氏從敦煌壁畫中學習，的確很容易使我們聯想到意大利文藝復興時的古典運動。文藝復興時代的大師們向古人學習，但完成的却是全新的技巧，因而達到了藝術史上最珍貴的成就。我相信，敦煌的藝術如果能够廣泛地流佈出來，其結果一定也會在中國近代藝術史上掀起一個壯關的波瀾。而且，影響所及，恐怕還不止繪畫一門——我想我們的文學，尤其是小說和史詩，一定也會因爲這「新」的血液而得到更豐富更美滿的生命。</p>
<p>致力敦煌壁畫</p>
<p>張大千是在這個方向努力的人。我問他何時再去敦煌時，他掀着黑白相間的虬髯，很興奮地說，至遲明春一定去。他在敦煌摹壁畫，（大多是盛唐時作品）已有一百二十幅左右，其中有八十多張已經完成，還有四十張左右的綫條沒有鈎好。這一百二十多張畫中，大小悉照原來的壁畫，最大的大概要四五間房間才可容納，錢條則大多是先用拷貝紙極精確地鈎劃，然後再複畫在布上。當然經過了那麼多年後，壁畫上原來的顏色自然不免脫落或者褪色，張氏的臨摹中便力謀恢復到原來的色彩，在這一步「重建」（Reconstruction）的工作中，他費去的心血的確不少。</p>
<p>他吿訴我說，敦煌天氣特別乾燥，從不下雨，下雪也非常稀少，這些山澗裏的東西就因爲托天之福，所以都保存得相當好。洞裏存有千年前留下的繩索，原是作欄保護壁畫的，至今也還相當牢固，用手拉也不會斷。</p>
<p>一幅魔女眩惑</p>
<p>我在畫展中很注意他的一幅「魔女眩惑」，那張畫高約三尺，中畫如來，莊嚴端坐，其前有裸女三人，在用不同的姿態去一眩惑」如來。這個題材並非極新，但是我當時就猜想一定是敦煌來的，因爲那三個裸女的綫條，簡直正確得近乎西洋畫裏的素描，和傳統的中國畫師筆下的仕女大不相同。後來我就問張氏此畫的來源，果然，張氏說，這就取自他臨摹的唐畫中的一小部份。但是，談到敦煌壁畫中的西洋影饗時，他却矢口加以否定。他的意思是，佛敎乍來中國，對智識階級的人民固然可以文字或言語傳道，對下一層的愚夫愚婦就不能不靠圖畫。而要傳道就不能過分驚世駭俗，所以明明是印度的佛也必須請中國的畫師來畫成中國人的樣子。至於裸女則我國本來占已有之，漢墓中的壁畫，香艷旖旎的正多的是，故敦煌畫之有裸女，也並不就能證明是受了外國的影響。</p>
<p>然而，張氏雖這樣說，這疑問却恐怕還是一個疑問。精硏中外交通史的向達先生，就認爲西洋影響是必然的，因爲依照他的考據，敦煌在古時實在是一個中外匯通的交通要地，惟其五方雜處，藝術作品中的外國影響就無可避免了。</p>
<p>向張二氏，都在敦煌留得頗久，因爲看法不同，吵嘴也歷時頗久了。明春在敦煌相遇之後，是不是還要爭下去呢？</p>
<h3>訪問旅長蕭同志　商談軍民成一片</h3>
<p>吳市長是最關懷民膜的，他立刻願意見一見現在駐紥在江灣的靑年軍二〇二師二旅的旅長蕭兆庚，商量一個妥善的辦法。</p>
<p>蕭團長恭敬地接待了吳市長。一陣寒暄後，便表示不大相信會有這種事實。然而他們因爲剛剛開拔到江灣，所以難免有許多不上軌道的地方，必須逐漸料正。</p>
<p>民政處長張曉崧提供了一個好辦法，張處長和蕭旅長原是黃埔軍校六期的同學。他說：靑年軍中可派幾個政工人員與區公所經常取得聯系！這樣就可以消除軍民的隔　，防止以後越規行勵的發生。這倒　　，　快地就　　方接受了。吳市長也就高高興興的回市府。</p>
<p>假如吳市長的視察起了作用，張處長的　　　　　切的實行，今後，軍　　佔民房竟然絕跡。那麼，江灣將沒有冬天，江灣的人民，將永遠是溫暖的。</p>

<h3>英國商業訪華團今日離滬飛台灣　鮑埃斯臨行前招待記者報吿　對我工商前途表示樂觀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商業訪華團鮑埃斯爵士等一行十餘人，於十月七日來華攷察商業及中英貿易情形，曾赴南京，北平，天津，漢口等各地視察，鮑氏等於前晚由京向蔣主席辭行後來滬，今日即赴台灣，轉廣州稍留三數日，然後經香港返英。昨日下午五時，鮑氏特假羣懋飯店招待記者，略述此次攷察觀感。</p>
<p>鮑氏吿稱：此次來華攷察，遍遊各地，所得資料極多，但必須整理完畢後，先向英政府當局報吿始能公開發表，而目前彼等尙未作最後決定，須待明年一月間將全部攷察結果決定，於三月間向當局報吿。但此次攷察分成數小集團，輪流至各工廠，礦區，工業區，商業機關參觀，並承各地官長及工商界人士熱忱招待，協助一切，深爲感激。並特代表全體團員致意。</p>
<p>鮑氏對於中國工商業情形表示：中國經八年抗戰，所受損失奇重，交通運輸均感缺乏，對於目前之工商業，當不能有所奢望，但中國工商業前途，必屬樂觀。中國政府當局最近頒令禁止進口若干種舶來品，此在其他各國均無此規定。但究其主要理由乃在平均中國進出口，安定經濟政策。所幸者渠會聞此項禁令乃係暫時性質，而在某種情形下，可有例外辦法。</p>
<p>比較言之，中國目前之工業尙朱發展，吾人希望能帮助中國建設工業，並平衡進出口，多輸人原料而少進次要物品。余（鮑氏稱）在英國欲爲妻兒購買之物品無着，而在上海反能購到。奢侈物品自宜禁止進口。</p>
<p>中國出口物產，當以大豆爲最大宗，據攷察結果，大豆待出口者其數較戰前增加二倍至三倍，然因運輸困難，致未能火量出口。而在英國方面，亦不願在無把握前先行簽訂貿易合約，致躭誤交貨期限，如六個月應交之貨物，屆時務須交貨，否則不如預先說明以免失去信用也。</p>
<p>關於中英商約，鮑氏以其任務不在此範圍內不便表示意見，但謂此約並非專涉商業方面，現正由兩國外交部進行談判。</p>

<h3>紡管會議決　美棉購買問題未決定前　棉紗議價不改變　獎勵民營紗廠赴產區收買國棉　購買國棉一包者准買美棉三包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織理委會會第十三次會議，於昨日下午三時，在市府會議舉行，出席吳瘺主任委員團楨，委員東襲間·王啓字·唐星海·榮鴻元·王仰先·楊錫仁·列席者李或怕·劉靖基·吳昆生·潘士浩·榮一心·郭瓊·許資新，伍乘道·王秉道·王秉鈞·周家聲·沈伯棄·唐志良·由吳兼主任委員國楨主席，會中討論頗爲烈，直至六時許始散。茲將其重要提案及決議，分誌如下：</p>
<p>第六區棉紡公會提案：（甲）棉紗議價請謂整案，其理由爲　價與一成不變之限價不問，應隨市況酌定，現原棉工資等項開繳，與上月比較，顯有不同，若不改方我，則生產紗廠，徒然受困，擬請每月根據上月議價，定其升降，並提議以現價一百七十五萬元爲準，再增中二十萬元。決議：（一）各紗廠應自即日盧，將生產量及存棉量呈報紡管會。（二）在美棉購買問題未決定前，暫不改變議價，俟各紗廠將生產量及存棉量報齊，兩星期後，再作討論。（乙）原棉亟應風聲緊進案：現値　棉季，國棉已登塲，宜利用時機，設法購進，惟近年國棉產量不豐，僅供紡粗紗之用，故各廠原料，多仰於美印外棉，自外滙與制後，外棉來源幾斷，存棉日少，故應未兩綢繆，以免生產挫折。決議：（一）各民營紗廠聨合組織收買棉花機構，赴產棉區，如鄭州等地採購。（二）各紗廠購買一包國棉，准其買三包美棉。多購者依此比例類推。（三）關於購買美棉問題，由吳市長與宋院長洽商後決定辦法。（丙）棉舷梯配銷應予確定案，上月配紗係應一時之急，其數額辦法，不無削足適履之弊，在生產商配予消費者外，如外埠轉運，消費之配受不足與不合等，皆應留俾縮餘地。決議：（一）十一月份暫按複製業每月所需冠軍賽　一萬四千件繼續配銷。（二）各紗廠所產棉紗，除留爲織布自用者，各複製業所需者，零售紗號所需者外，准予運往外埠銷售。</p>
<h3>複配會要求　核定配紗支數　紗款准免預繳</h3>
<p>上海市棉紗複製品工業公會配紗委員會關於棉紗配給證之意見，略謂，昨由紡管會議決，對於複製工業配紗，擬行配紗證制，經本會第十次委員會議決，原則贊同，惟尙有下列數點，應請顧空全（一）配紗支　應請查明核定，以前歷次配紗未能盡合實用，且每次配紗，其支雖數量，時有變更，分配深覺困難，應請就紗廠現有設備及已往業務情形，查明其生產支雖及數量，並參照各複製紗廠用紗支數，分雖核定其應負擔配紗之支數，紡具統計，以資互相配合，免致逐次變更。決議：第六紡織區公會，儘下星期一將生產紗支統計列表，由第六棉紡區指定若干人，會同本會派員一人，分赴各複廠調查其配銷情形。（二）交貨日期應請分別明定：以前本會承配棉紗，紗廠間有延誤交貨日期情事，此乃紗廠生產量與其售數未能配合，每於交貨時，尙未完成製品之所致，應就紗廠生產能力作準確之統計，分別規定其交貨日期，俾受配者可以一定期日前往出貨。決議：原則通過。（三）繳款應免預繳：以前　款時，僅換取棧單，須憑棧單於十日內絡出貨，而事實上尙有延誤情事，已如請運，故以後配紗，應請免予預繳，改照前項規定交貨日期，隨時繳款，隨時出貸。決議；延期應退利息，如廠方不允退還，可向紡管會吿發。</p>
<h3>廠商出售餘紗　必須通知紗業</h3>
<p>關於紗商業者：（一）各廠依上項決定辦法，以餘紗一半售給舷梯商，其中一半由廠方供給老客戶，半數交紗業公會；分配，其由廠方售與老顧客者應由各廠開戰通知紗業公會。尙由市長宣佈，明日起，如不開單呈送，必令公用局對該廠予以停電處分，並至少停電三天。（二）維持紗業公會每月一五〇〇件，以應門市。</p>
<h3>加強配銷機構</h3>
<p>紡管會提案：（一）查銷委員會機構前經本會第九次會議決議，應予加強，目前分配問題，殊爲繁重，該配銷委員會應如何加強之處，請討論公決案，決議：以後配銷委員會開會時，複製品業公會得推代表二人，紗商業公會得推代表一人列席。</p>
<h3>准紡廿三支紗</h3>
<p>（三）查前據六區肥會稱：恒通，廣勤，崇信等廠，紡製廿三支紗，請以廿支紗標準價格，提高百分之十定價一案，經十一月二十一日本會談話會決定，先查明各複製業公會有無請配廿三支紗，再行議價，茲查各複製業所送需紗申請表，並無請配廿三支紗之情，惟該廠等旣有此項產品，該六區公會所議，照廿支紗加百分之十定價，應否准予備案，請討論公決案，決議照進。</p>
<h3>機械進口少　舊貨索價頗高</h3>
<p>本市某次洋行稱：自動利以還，凡民用工業應用之機械，迄今尙無進口以國外機械工業經大戰後，尙未恢復正常，故大量供應尙須相當時間，現本市各洋行所有各項機器，亦屬寥寥無幾，故舊貨機件，索價愈昂，目前二三匹之舊貨柴油機，每架須三百萬元左右，大馬力之動力機，更無確價。</p>
<h3>申請絲織貸款　共計三百餘家</h3>
<p>絲織業貸款，中交兩行已認廿五日開始辦理，截至昨日止，申請者共計三百餘家，五千五百臺，按四聨核定辦法，十臺以上者，始由中交兩行貸放，十臺以下者，則向工商貸款銀團申請，故中交所辦者，係十臺以上之廠家，共計二百家，四千六百八十六臺，中行分辦一百零五家，二千三百三十八臺，交行分九十五家，計二千三百四十八臺，昨日又有新大等七家繼續申請，中行分做四家，交行做三家，中交以各廠所報臺數，多有不符，已分別派員調查，如有不實者，祇按其實數貸放，以免圖套利息。</p>
<h3>細紗喴四百八十萬　棉布去路甚旺連帶提高　下月南運額昨已經核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市益形堅挺，念支紗又升二三萬元，客帮雖有採辦，然供售之人，市塲上卅二支陽鶴單紗及十支粗紗限價交易，頗不寂寞，四十二支雙股綫，在現爲什貸廳缺中，塲外喴價竟商至四百八十萬之巨。</p>
<p>棉布行市續升，各方進胃甚濃，嗶嘰坯布續漲二三千元不等，士林布染廠開價高五千元左左右，昨日紡價，亦舉市塲現價相差無幾，如金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰，現貨十萬六千五百元，紡建開千萬五千元，祇差一千五百元，其他花嘰貢呢尙平。</p>
<p>紡管會核准十一月從份南運之紗布總額，迄昨日爲止，計棉紗三八七一件，棉布一〇七七五二件。</p>
<h3>金價微跌美鈔堅挺　港票及港滙回漲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨供源雖減，人心尙定，晨開二六七萬二有求，工後浮多有售，曾低至二六六萬五左右，嗣後即吿穏健，稍稍回升，供泊見寂，買戶倍形鎭定，十時後央行以二六七萬五之價，配給五〇條，大後經實銷抵補，近午曾回升至二六九萬以上，始被壓迫回落，午刻在二六七萬五至二六八萬之間徘徊，午後銀根爲月底關係面見緊，被迫下游，曾退至二六四萬五而後略回，較前收又跌二萬，飾金掛低至廿八萬，紋銀平而銀元微挫，暗拆銀根晨平平緊，息價升爲一角半光景。</p>
<p>外幣昨忽回挺，美鈔晨開時爲四七五〇元至四八〇〇元，午刻回升至四八五〇元左右掙扎，午後金市回小，又回低至回八〇左右掙扎，較前日微升，港票曾回漲到九七〇元，午後略回，結果尙較前收漲起十元，港匯因申電報小，金鈔助買影響，升爲九三五元至九四五元，印匯一一三五元至一一四五元，共匯一五一〇〇元至一五二〇〇元，交易仍少，美匯依然故我。</p>

<h3>中大校長吳有訓　出月回校</h3>
<p>前爲營葬先人返籍</p>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕盛傳辭職之國立中央學校長吳有訓，係東南大學畢業，並曾留學，歷任淸華大學敎授。據聞吳於勝利後，對中大復員設備，請款添建校舍等等，進行順利，並無景響其去職問題。惟吳完全是一學者，往往有書生脾氣，主觀所及，不願人于涉其用人行政，因歷史關係，教授有南有北，意見容有參差，吳旣是純粹學者，而少行政手腕，或者因一部份敎授之一時責難而萌退志。說者謂吳於南北兩派敎授之間，均有相當關係，足資調和，不致趨於消極之途。吳離校返贛後，外間頗多揣測。學生方面，因在渝與吳校長患難相從，復員至今，尙未上課，深恐因易長而未當其選，更足以影響學業前途者至鉅，因此學生之一致口號，「拿書來讀」，並由學生自治會一致挽留吳校長返校。此次吳離校，回南昌原籍，係爲其先人營葬，並非掛冠他去。頃從該校何秘書長方面聞悉，吳校長最近來信，約出月來京。聞敎部方國，亦無更換中大校長之意。</p>

<p>浙江漁民生涯  十六日訊　本報杭州特派員儲裕生　　在浙江二千一百七十六萬二千二百四十八個人民中，百分之八十以上是靠着農業過生活的，其中百分之五是賴漁爲生，以這百分之五倍算起來，也有將越一百外萬的人口，是靠着用手工製造成的船，用手工織成的漁網，用兩手勞動，在大海裏追求着魚蹤而生活的。關於浙省漁業的近况，記者已在九月五日「在舟山羣島上」一文裏報道過了，現在僅想想一些關於他們的生活，來作爲關心漁業人士的參考。　　（一）舟山羣島　　浙江的大漁塲，當首推舟山羣島，舟山羣島爲定海所轄全部有一百八十五個島嶼，其中岱山，長　山爲產大黄魚小黄魚之區，春秋二季，漁民常來此生活。另屬於江蘇省轄的嵊泗列島，爲產帶魚之區，冬季漁民聚集於此，據說嵊泗列島上的人民幾乎都爲浙江籍的漁民，因此有人說嵊泗列島，原應屬浙江轄的，因爲江蘇沒有漁塲，才勉强劃入江蘇省的。我們姑不管嵊泗列島是否應屬浙江的問題，而在朝鮮和我國姻台以南，台灣以北的海面土，是浙江漁民的家園，這應該是毫無疑義的了。　　這號稱百萬的漁民，散佈在舟山羣島與嵊泗列島上，有極少數的人守着他們自己的漁船飄泊在海洋裏。他們眞是一貧如洗，逢到漁汛將至時，便向以往的債主或是漁行裏貸款，債主的利息特別高，今年春季，已越一角二角，漁行裏雖然美其名爲「不要利息」，但是待漁民收穫時，必須貶價售給漁行，還不是等於重利盤剝。漁民們忍痛借了錢却沒有一個不含着血淚還着債，這種守信用淳樸敦厚的古風，使債主們和漁行們有了保障；只要把錢一借出，躺在靠椅裏坐待他們來還錢還魚。　　（二）漁民重擔　　還有一批人，他們用資本來造一些木船，專門租給連破船也沒有的漁民，今年春季三個月，每條船要租七十石米，以沈家門七萬元一石米來估計，則三個月就要五百萬元。我們在杭州鹹魚舖去一問，黄魚兩千元一斤，帶魚三千二百兀一斤，就是說要黄魚在杭州的市價二千五百斤，帶魚在杭州市價一千五百六十二斤半始能償還這五百萬元的船租。但杭州距離產地須兩天半的路程，又經過漁行轉售給鹹魚舖運價利息加上後，始爲每斤兩千與三千二百元市價，如果在產地轉售給漁行，尤其是貸給漁民款的漁行，其價貶得使人不能想像，那麽不知要幾千萬斤始能償還這一季全部的債務！　　在漁汛來時，深更半夜，晨光曦微，姻霧迷濛中都要喚起同船中的人，勉强睜開惺忪的倦眼，在遼闊無邊的海洋上，兒女照呼着爹媽，老的照應着小的，把自已頻年摸案所得的經騐，在此時實地的傳習着，偶然一個不小心，船觸了礁，或是風太緊，浪太兇，舵把不不穩，懂水性的人，趕緊叫全船的人蹲下來，翻了，全船的人就此葬身在海洋裏，任那滾滾的波濤把他們送到從沒有到過的地方，掙扎！終於被那本來要捕的魚噬嚙着了。債主們還要打聽他們的家屬，甚至要家屬們賠償債務的。　　（三）神的崇拜　　漁民們像是沒有牘書權利似的，因此，多的是文肓，他們不曉得時代在進步，他們不曉得如何可以保障自己的生命，他們更不知道如何减輕自己的負擔來享合法的權利？祇知道憑他們數千年傳襲下來的簡單漁具，數千年傳襲下來的習慣經騐，這樣捕魚，捕魚！從出生到老死都在捕魚中生活！一切委諸於命運，一切委諸於自然，結果，他們特別迷信，生活也特別浪漫。在他們之闐最崇拜的菩薩是西母娘娘和二郞菩薩，西母娘娘相傳千年之前有一位老漁夫，在海上遇險，飄流到一個小島上，那個島渺無人姻，却僅有一個廟，廟裏有一位女身菩薩，老漁夫在島上好幾天沒有飯吃，而道位菩薩的供桌上天天有新鮮麵包之類供給。因此浙江的每個島上幾都有西母娘娘廟，（二郎廟的傳說也類似）。在每年春，秋，冬三季漁汛盛收後，西母娘娘廟和二郎廟的香火鼎盛。前往膜拜者肩摩踵接。漁民生活的浪漫情形也在此時暴露無餘，他們似乎「只有今天，沒有明天」；所以縱情縱慾，喝酒非至爛醉不休，賭博非至金盡不止，嫖妓玩樂，無所不爲。他們想不着莫待無錢想有錢的時候，他們根本「有錢也是身外之物」，「命中註定的窮苦」，所以無錢窮困的時候，都委諸於菩薩的旨魚了。　　（四）改善生活　　今年春季漁汎太差，他們說：「這是去年向菩薩許願的人，　心還得太少的關係」。所以夏初的時候，西母娘娘廟與二郞廟香烟更盛，有的借高利貸來「還愿」的。　　其實漁汎的好壞事前也可以知道的，只要把海流，水溫，比重，鹽分，水色，透明度，生物含量調查好。只怪以往我們的政府沒有功夫注意到這些，而靠着漁民發財的債主，漁行的老闆們，也沒有想到不勞而穫的可恥。　　現在浙江省政府已經注意這些問題了，但存在漁民間的問題，還是海上治安與高利貸剝削，不能自由賣買等這些。浙省雖然已在滬進行商借登陸艇六條，但登陸艇是平底，不適於遠洋的，漁船一飄百千里，登陸艇不能保護。農民銀行和浙省地方銀行雖然已經舉辦貸款，但農行僅在溫州，玉環分配貸與一萬萬元，地行僅貸王環二千萬元，象山三千萬元，而頭等漁場漁戶最多的舟山羣島的主島——定海附近，到反而沒有貸款。聯總補充損失的舊式漁船木材部份，要到明年才能運到。政府雖然盡力取締漁行，改設漁市塲，以求自由賣買，但漁市塲的力量，終究敵不過漁行。　　基於以上關於漁民實際生活的陳述和當前爲解除漁民痛苦設施的檢討，我們覺得還要加緊一步努力，今天漁民的問題，不單是政治上的閒題，而是要集合一切科學家經濟家的力量，合作貫通始能澈底解決。否則，捕魚人的生活始終不能改良，不能改良，便只有退步。捕魚人因爲生活的不能改良，於是魚產低劣，使東海的良好漁港歸於淘汰。漁業二三事  甦　　漁業爲我國重要生產事業之一，就廣義言之，得包括水產之捕撈，製造，養殖，及其他有關之各部門，故又稱之爲水產事業。此項事業，在目前經濟建設之過程中，已爲一般企業家所重視，而政府於此次由中農所放出之漁貸十億元，爲數雖微，尤足以振奮沿海漁民之及早組成漁業合作社。茲將江浙兩省最近漁業狀况，作一鳥瞰，俾供國內人士檢討。　　集會紀盛　　江浙兩省漁業，其重心確在浙海洋面之定海，故記述應從浙江始。而此次寗，台，溫漁業建設會議之開成，氣象更爲篷勃。二十日上午九時，寗波六區專員公署主催，計到中國農民銀行代表鄔憲章，邵宗誥，曁六區專員兪濟民，鄞縣縣長陳佑華，鎭海縣長葛延林，奉化縣長周靈鈞，定海縣長朱慕之，寗海縣長李潔，象山縣長孟鑄（許煥文代）七區合作社代表毛賢友，漁會代表金寄桴，浙江漁業局長饒用泌，建設廳合作管理處長葉枚，全國漁業公司聯合辦事處樂濟世，六區專員於鳳園，陳曰濤，寗波漁市塲李星頡，胡國門，鄞縣漁會史錦純，鄞縣合作社謝葆友，東錢湖合作社史淸華，曹世浩，寗海縣漁會薛國盛，奉化縣漁會林岫亭，沈德昌，桐蕉合作社林尙遼，虹溪合作社王士蓀，胡嘉賓，棲鳳合作社沈天元，象山縣漁會曁石浦合作社許煥文，南韮山合作社陳淵，定海縣漁會苗邦邕，第一合作社馬龍圖，丁筱梅，沈家門合作社曹信夫，鎭海爲漁會王錫光，大溪合作社朱祖變，金立剛，戴文賢，浙江水產建設協會趙次勝，吳筆峯，胡德聞，何之貞，寗波代表林克　，吳　閣，寗彼分會沈漁，鮑茂榮，定海代表馮子康，共四十八人，這盛會上，雖有若干代表是漁民出身，但加入會塲時，到也衣冠楚楚，周旋在地方長官與銀行界之間。　　漁貸貧配　　漁貸分配，是以　，溫，合三屬各縣漁區漁業合作社，爲貸款對象，依照各地漁民從業人數，及漁船隻數之多寡爲比例，計寗屬佔十分之五·五，合屬佔十分之二·五，溫屬佔十分之二。至担保手續，與償還辦法，經決定：甲·社員對合作社之保證，（一）漁具連保，（二）商家舖保，（三）漁獲物及社員之財產，（四）漁船漁具抵押。乙·合作社對銀行之保證，由常地縣政府担保。次爲發放漁貸，應派員監督，其辦法（一）由各縣担保者派員隨時監督，（二）由浙江水產建設協會及省合作社合派員査問是否發放與加入合作社之漁民，（三）得漁貸之合作社，應先造具入社社員之名册三份，一送担保之縣政府，一送浙江水產建設協會，一送當地農民銀行，備作査考，其有補入社者，亦須於入社一星期內，補送入社名册，並塡寫入社日期等項，（四）各合作社應準備社股若干，參加各處魚市塲爲股金，由省聯合社派員分駐各魚市塲監視漁民貸款之運用，並得酌情提成，勸令儲蓄。而分配此十億元之貸款，完全由省聯八社主持，而此省聯合社，則由水產協會負責籌組，且於貸款數目，亦經該會議中表決，貸款最多者，如寗屬定海得一萬五千萬元，奉化一萬三千五百萬元，象山九千五百萬元。台屬臨海，溫嶺，三鬥數亦不弱。溫屬因無代表出席，分配數應另由該區決定。　　劃分漁場　　由該會建議政府，從速劃分近海與遠洋漁塲之界綫，而免紛爭。所謂近海漁塲，着重在離開海岸二百米達以內之海區，據一般學者所論，此等重要區域，亦稱「海柵」，以離岸近，深度不大，由海面以至海底，所受海流潮汐及波浪之影響至鉅，日光亦可相當透達，水溫比重等，皆變化適度，並由陸上河流所衝入之物質，非常豐富，於浮游生物及各種水族，蕃殖滋多，近海漁塲之可寳貴，應以此種海柵地帶，爲其範圍。但深海中，亦間有二百米達以內之淺處，此種兀立於深海中之地盤，尤爲最良好之漁塲。恰如陸地之高原，其興四　深海之水深，差度　大，則漁塲愈佳。因海流與此地盤衝突，變爲上昇流，捲起海水之變調，對於洄游魚類，可常令其魚羣棲止於此，捕撈至爲便易。次議及如何協助建設南　山與如何繁榮長　港案，另由提案人撥具詳細辦法。乃討論恢復浙江水產學校，及如何籌措該校基金案，經決議先由該會派風赴定海勘査明確，再行商討。提案又轉入護漁問題，除由漁民自行充實自衛力量外，請求政府撥給一百噸以上二百噸以下柴油鐵壳船一艘，作爲護漁船，並由政府供給軍服械彈。但護漁經費，以不取用於漁民爲原則，由浙江水產建設協會及省漁業聯合社籌措之。　　帶魚汎期　　我國沿海之魚生產，一年四季俱有，且取之不盡，用之不竭，其中於魚汎稍分淡旺而已。現在時屆冬令，正當帶魚汎期，而漁塲區域，則偏在江蘇省境之嵊泗列島，和佘山洋面。漁船集中地之嵊山，乃値得一述。嵊山面積甚小，抵不上香港，其地位在長江口外，花鳥島之東南，島上山巒重疊，最高峯拔海七百呎，但少樹木，雖一望蒼翠，但身臨其地，祇見荒烟蔓草，怪石　峨，令人意典紫然。該島魚生產，於春季黄花魚，夏季　魚，數字巳感龐大，總以帶魚居首位，估價量，達千億元以上。而此種帶魚，體狹長似帶，全體銀白色，有銳利的牙齒，每年冬季自北南游，在小　節，（廿三日）開始採捕。漁船雖不下萬艘，但百分之八十五，由浙省漁區駛來。於是浙江水產建設協會監事趙次勝，以江浙漁業股份有限公司名義，派代表林克　駐嵊山，督理本屆帶魚汎，並對不良魚行，加以取締，蓋漁民最大痛苦，爲受魚行倒賬，高利貸實居其次。而最値得注意者，爲海匪之行動，査該島盤踞有年之巨匪潘招財，以出賣旂（紅底白邊綴一白色潘字之三角小旂）卡（即潘匪名片黏有潘匪小照片）給養匪衆，約有長短槍二百枝，輕重機槍七挺，雖經省方收撫，但並未遵令就範，目前綏靖機關，爲肅淸海匪計，已擬有妥善辦法。但潘匪以嵊山爲窟穴，廣置姬妾，享用豪華，儼然一土皇帝，欲令其革面洗心，實大非易事。惟其秘書柯瑞良，稍通文墨，尙有識見，於創辦敎育，提高漁民智識水準，不無微功足述，尤以壓制魚行用秤，由十八兩重秤，改爲省頒市秤一項，深得漁民歡心。李天霞師長在蘇北前綫視察　（本報泰縣記者凌松壽攝）　　國軍一四八旅廖旅長在蘇北新收復區留影　（本報駐泰縣記者凌松壽攝）國產三輪汽車試車成功  八日航訊　本報天津記者李紹林　　交通部平津區汽車修配總廠所屬天津汽車製配廠自製三輪汽車的成功，無異是中國汽車工業茁長的先聲，這一個成功的試騐，引起他們全廠工程師的振奮，四百多個技術工人的工作情緒，也被熱烈鼓舞起來，平津區汽車修配總廠，是由接收的偽華北自動車工業株式會社以及怡豐橡皮廠，富士電池廠等單位合併組成的，在天津牠有直轄的兩個工廠，一是天津汽車製配廠，另一個是天津汽車修理廠，三輪汽車的製造成功，是製配廠的功績，主持人在設想着，再經過一個時期後，能進而製造一般大的客　汽車，使全國公路上都有國產　汽車行駛。　　初步設計　　三輪汽車的製造設計，是由本年二月開始的，在製配廠黄植廠長和二十餘位工程師會同硏究下，他們參照着製配廠的設備能力，事實的需要，各種機型的優劣，首先決定把這個理想中的三輪汽車採用單氣缸空氣冷却式，　之就以日製大設牌三輪車爲藍本，開始繪圖製造，製造工作實際上從三月份開始，若干技術上的困難，工作上的障礙，在持續不斷的努力下獲得解決，於是在五月底，國內空前的第一輛自製三輪汽車，裝竣出廠，駛上公路，到八月底，又陸續完成了九輛，在這十輛已經完成的三輸汽車中，有蓬車七輛，吉普車、貨車、底盤車各一輛，製配廠預計在明年一月底以前製成五十輛，假定的生產量是明年一月至三月，日出一輛，四月至七月日出三輪，八月以後使全部設備發揮到最高能力，每日可以製成五輛。　　全部自製　　這些三輪汽車，除了車上的磁石發電機，變壓器和其他少數電料外，所需的一千一百零二種零件，都是製配廠自行製造，每項零件要經過三數個或十數個程序，合計要經過一萬多程序，才能完成所需的機件，加以裝配，裝成後的轎車，全重八百公斤，蓬車重七百七十公斤，吉普式車重六百五十公斤，每車可以搭客三人至五人，貨車自重六百八十公斤，載重六百五十公斤，底盤車自重四百八十五公斤，載重七百五十公斤，三輪汽車的馬力是七四半，一、三公尺寬的路面即足行駛，四、八公尺寬的路面就能一次調頭，因爲牠的最小轉向半徑祇二千四百公厘，車上的燃料油箱可以裝汽油三加侖，機器油箱可以　機油一加侖，時速最高達五十公　，每一加侖汽油可足行駛四十　里之用，最近該廠接受定製的價格，蓬車四百五十萬元，吉普式車四百萬元，貨車三百六十萬元，底盤車三百二十萬元，這種三輪汽車，不僅適用於都市內的交通，也可以是農村間短途運輸的理想交通工具。　　公開試車　　九月二十八日，平津區汽車修配總廠以這十部首批國產三輪汽車在津市結隊而作首次公開試車，在天津鬧市內環行了一週，當這些車子騁馳在馬路上的時候，行人用驚奇的眼光看着牠們，特別是車身上掛着的紅布標，「國產三輪汽車」一行大字更招人注意，這個民族工業上的初步成就，顯然已經引起社會的重視，由東北及上海等地紛向製配廠訂製洽購這些車輛上更可以看出牠本身的價値。三輪貨車的型式，一如大型汽車，流綫型的車頭後，是一個鐵皮裝成的貨兜，轎車式的客車是徹頭尾的流綫型，裏面有兩排座位，後排是長皮椅，可以坐三人，前排是二個精小的皮椅，分裝在車中左右車窗下，篷車的帆布頂蓬可以很輕便的裝起或落下，輕便靈活，應當是這種車輛特具的優點，此外，由於减聲器的裝置，所以當發動以後，牠沒有像通常的麾托車那樣的震耳呌囂。　　工廠內部　　製造三輪汽車的天津汽車製配廠，包括有六個工廠，第一廠冶金，凡合金鍊製翻沙鑄製等工作，是屬於冶金廠的，第二廠機械，凡鑽刨等各種機件的製成工作是屬於機械廠的，第三廠是電氣，凡電表等電氣機件其可以自行製造的，都由電氣廠完成，第四廠是鈑金，凡車身車箱所需裝配的鐵板鐵皮等工作是屬於　金　，第五廠木工，負責製造車上所有需要的木材裝置，第六橡膠廠，是負責製造內外車胎以及各種橡膠零件，製配廠現在共有工人四百餘人，工程師，技術員二十餘人，要趨使三輪汽車大量生產，他們要體技衛工人增至一千四百人，工程師技衛員要增加到一百四十人，材料方面，接收過來的一點東西，大槪可以維持半年之用，將來國內不能製造的材料，仍需仰賴於外貨的輸入，汽車工業祇是全部工業裏的一環，當然牠不能在各方面都達到自給自足。　　縱然天津汽車製配廠現在的成就還不是完全合於理想，但也應該是可喜的。在華北自動車株式會社時代，除了修配汽車外，日本人從沒想到可以出產汽車，接收以後，製造三輪汽車的設計工作開始後，多少人也認爲是一種冒險，而這冒險的設計，現在却終於實現了。桂林寒流  廿一日航訊　本報桂林記者梁小中　　能够體會山水柔情的人，走入山水的境地，往往一峯半　，平湖深溪，都會引起無限的感觸，不是怡然的欣悅，便是無名的抑鬱，也許沒有人能够想像到困居在一個荒城裏的苦惱，更不會想像到寒冷的人民怎樣在寒冷的漠野裏度過寒冷的冬天。桂林的山水依舊在凄寂裏透着秀麗，但是彷彿我的感覺已經更加麻木，這裏眞的是無比的澹靜，澹靜得在我的腦幕上只能够反映出一片灰藍色的天，一片枯黄的地，和幾堆高聳得怕人的大石塊。　　死大半傳單散發　　西伯利亞的寒流捲奔盡中國的東南，然後輕輕地帶着一片濛濛細雨，遲疑地替桂林披上了一件嚴冬的衣裳，北大人從山巓撲入城市的上空，又從城市的上空帶走了雨雲，一晴一暗，憂破了窮人的膽。莫道寒夜堪慮，朝朝看着正陽門的「刦餘」們跪在冰冷的石板上向行人叩頭泣訴，看着他們採擷城牆下的野菜充飢，誰能够提起半點愉快的心情，去欣賞獨秀峯下的斜氣綠水？靜靜的地面上蘊藏着重重愁苦，聽過桂北三個月死亡二萬的慘痛，除了整天說災道難而外，呌我還寫得出半個來基麽字？　　亂離的日子再加上四面兵馬的聲音，許許多多的事象影入眼簾，都加重地使人感到心灰意懶，不是憎惡現實，就是逃避現實，廣西人把死亡當作「旣得利益」，於是不期然把災難推到天意的身上，到處流布着甚麽「人心不古，世道袞微，萬民有罪，要死大牛」的傳單，看起來簡直是一個絕大的諷刺。「中國烏克蘭」一角　興華的血淚  十五日泰縣訊本報駐泰記者凌松壽　　記者以十二分沉重的心境，來寫這篇血和淚組織成的文字。在這裏，記者願以誠懇的態度，希望藉這一篇文字之力，吿訴更多的一些人：「解放區」究竟是一個什麼？　　蘇北米糧出產豐富，向有「中國的烏克蘭」之別號，而其主要的產區，即在興化。翻開地圖一看，縱貫蘇北的范公堤和運河堤，緊緊地夾住了這個古老的城市。由於地勢低窪，其間河港交錯，湖泊縱横，形成了一個標準的糧產區，可是，也因爲這點，每到初秋淮河水漲，運河河身不能容納，不得不啓壩宣洩之時，興化就首當其衝，變成了眞正的「水國」。據說興化城牆之高僅與泰州地面相平，確否待證。　　敵人勢力伸展到蘇北後，揚·通各縣相繼淪陷。而興化和泰縣始終在覆巢之下茍延殘喘。當時省政府設治興化，軍事中心則在塞縣。卅年二月李長江率部宣吿參加「和述」，敵軍隨即進兵興化，配合水上部隊，在飛機的掩護下，開始猛擊。其時駐防於興化的國軍是八十九軍第一一七師的二個團和直轄於該軍的第六旅。血戰兩晝夜，格於情勢，國軍不得不忍痛退出。至此，蘇北已沒有一縣份不在敵人的鐵蹄下了。我們的政府和都隊，便只有在鄕村間展開游擊行動，艱苦地和敵人奮鬥着！　　抗戰勝利，蘇北共軍藉着環境上的便利，向各縣進攻，實現他們「爭取地盤」的政策。駐紮在興化的偽軍第廿二師，奉命死守。×月×日（古歷七月廿一日）午夜十二時，於細雨濛濛中，共軍向興化進攻。一時槍砲聲交起，居民由睡夢中驚醒，相顧失色。而城外僞軍因有預定計劃，幷未抵抗退守城垣。於是半夜之間，興化城垣外圍據點盡失。次日晚間，共軍開始攻城，砲火熾烈，雙方死傷均重。如此一直到第三天，城仍未下。共軍乃運用到他最後的一着。用雲梯數百架，架在城牆上，驟使民兵，向城頭猛進。守軍初以短槍抵抗，後來上來的人太多了，便用大刀砍他們的手。可憐的民兵，不向上衝，下面架的機關槍，立時可以死。向上衝，不到城頭，手就被砍了，依然是從梯子上跌下去！這樣地來一個殺一個，來二個殺一雙的下去，一直到守軍傷亡殆盡，而手已經砍得酸了的時候，城終於破了。共軍總算藉着老百姓的力量，，得到最後的「勝利」——城旣破，這一塲緊張的塲面就此結束。可是，這兒可該加個附註：就是因攻城被砍去雙手而死的民兵的屍首，事後共軍裝運了三只大船他往，而其餘臭，過了一個很長的時期才消滅。　　共軍在抗戰期間說：「我們專打鬼子和和平軍，絕對愛護老百姓！」一般人對他也的確有相當信仰。但是這一仗，却漸漸地搖動了他們對共軍的信心。他們想：「打和平軍爲什麽要拿百姓去做頭陣呢。」　　過了一個相當時間後，他便發動組織自治機構。他的系統是這樣的：　　其間鎭（鄕）長，街（村）長和小組長皆由民選。民衆大會中，每一個參加者都懷着怕被選到自己身上來的鬼胎，所以不管李四張三，只要有人一提議，大家誰都拍手贊成。被選的爲了怕蒙上一個「反動份子」的頭街，又不得不做下去。共軍的自治機構，就這樣地建繁在恐怖的氛圍中。　　繼此之後，慢慢地聯絡各界智識簡單的人，組織婦抗會，農抗會，僧抗會，商聯會，婦女協會，兒童團，科察隊等等，終日惹是生非，一待時機成熟，「鬥爭」即行開始。　　共軍有句口號：「窮人要翻身，完全靠鬥爭。」就這句話的魔力，引誘了若干的窮人，受着他們的利用。「鬥爭」的過程，是怎麼樣呢？他們找好了目的，認爲某個人合於鬥爭的資格（就是三資；資本，資產，資望）。就用金錢誘引附近游手好事之徒，加以檢舉。隨即召開民衆大會公決。開會時，由共軍幹部任主席。先將編好的一套事實硬加於被檢舉者身上，然後呌他「坦白」。當然，被檢舉者心裏廂明白，背後有着檢舉的人，不容你不承認；等到你承認之後，主席即問大家應當怎樣處罰？這時潛伏於大衆間的共軍派好的人物，就大喊大呌，說是應當怎樣怎樣罰；呌出來後，在塲的民衆，「不關己事不開口」，還不是滿都贊同，就在一片鼓掌聲中，結束了這一齣戲劇式的「民意審判」。事後，所罰的稻子麥子等，除了分少許給原檢舉人外，其餘的都集中到「人民政府」的倉庫裏去了。　　在「解放區」內，共軍監禁一個人，是再便當沒有的一回事。他們任何一個團體中人（如農抗會，兒童團等等），與某一個人有着私隙。只要自主管機關「檢舉」一下，九個鐘點內，可以使你嚐到鐵窗風味。直到你出來之後，你還不曾知道你究竟是爲了一個什麼樣的罰名而被監禁。　樣的，殺人也是這樣，只要有人檢舉，萬事全休。他們很「善意」地把你「解放」到天國裏去。　　到了最近，可更乾脆！因爲共軍在蘇北不斷地遭受打擊，他們自己明白，蘇北已不是藏身之所了。於是到處造成恐怖空氣。遇到一個他們認爲該殺的人，隨時隨地可以辦掉，再也不必徵求「民意」。這稀現象，不單是興化這樣，蘇北的「解放區」內，差不多完全如此。　　當然，照現在的局勢而論，蘇北全面肅淸的時機已經成熟，老百姓的「血淚生涯」，想來不久也該結束。可是，我們反過來想想：雖是一分鐘的時間，在「解放區」內，又該覺得如何地冗長呢？　　流亡者在嘆息着。　　我也在這兒作文字上的嘆息！種子貸款·救濟品　化學肥料五千噸運入省境　　老百姓對於生合價値的看法，倒也淡漠得很，只是「求死不能」的人才會感到絕大的痛苦，舉一隅徴軍糧的事實來看，便足以視其他，軍糧徴集至今依然一個未了之局，差不多各縣都有這樣的情形，農民老遠從村子挑糧到城市繳交，往往要等上十天半月是一件「天經地義」的事，有積蓄點的把住伙舖的錢等光，住到街頭上，沒錢的呆在街頭，等到要賣褲子還家，尤其是天寒地凍，他們還要兼挑一張破棉胎出來，在街頭寒風下蹲個十天八夜。收糧的糧秤，也天經地義的一定和送糧的每石相差五斤至八斤不等，一石差五斤，收上一萬石，這批「利潤」如何：收糧人拳打脚踢，送糧人是家常便飯，稍不當意，把個糧政科長拉去押幾天，也不算一會事，運來的穀米濕一點，也得挑回頭，許多縣政府看不過眼，替送糧人租屋存儲糧穀，聽候收點。　　送去的送了，老百姓也未嘗沒有人送禮物，有些農戶得到了一百元的「種籽貸款」，有些分發到一些冬令救濟，救濟品是一頂爛帽，一條破手帕，如此安慰，直是不慰猶可，一慰氣死，前幾天又有五千噸化學肥料運入省境，最少我的心裏總是這樣想着：「一定又是一人一勺」。　　冬防　　看到治安　　「要死大半」的警吿我有點不相信，然而就「科學」的眼光去看，彷彿又有點「似非而是」，譬如桂林的治安當局連天呌冬防局長先生到廣州住了個多月，回來時說是「購回大批消防器材」，人心有恃無恐，誰料前幾天水東門一塲大火，燒去了房子近三百間，災民又添三千人，救火時，有目共睹，水桶都難找一隻，很像消防器材的出動，「尙有待也」，以是觀之，「死個精光」也不敢擔保，何况僅僅「要死大半」。　　從冬防看治安，總有點心驚肉跳，公路上出舛子的事固然「罄竹難書」，還得要聽聽許多「革命軍」的故事，南路共黨支持下的有鄭坤儀（張炎之妻）的「人民解放軍」在十萬大山粵桂邊打家劫舍，「解放」錢財。崑崙關附近又發現了一支「越南革命軍」爲非作歹越南革命軍革入我們的地方，可謂滑稽墨突，其實還不都是賊。許多足以使人挺而走險的因素，弄成了一個不安的局面，政府的武力有限，三四個保團綏靖地方，濟不了甚事。　　聽得膩　　也寫得膩　　用冷靜的眼光，向着」片荒凉的土地簡直不能够寫出一句話來，也許睡藏在廣西的每一個角落裏還有更大的憂抑，但是我們所能够發掘的却是那末膚淺，呻吟和呼籲都不足補救於萬一·蜷居在桂林，能够走入耳膜的只有許多「聽也可，不聽也無妨」的謠言，一會兒說省主席換人，一會兒又說民政廳長辭職，一會兒又說這個和那個爭着把握某部份幹部努力，聽得膩也寫得膩，能省聽一次省參會議長飛京呼籲减免糧賦的事已經算得不平凡，雖然儘管收獲是在平凡以下。　　寫完一次報道，我總喜歡嘆一口氣，然後一個人彳亍地獨行在幽　的山　，再看一次桂林，今天鄹躅在灕江岸旁，伏波山的險影遮掩着乾涸的江流，野孩子俯身在沙灘上找尋着螺蛤，沉默的漁夫，沉重的漁網，「沙」的一聲也聽得那末陰森，淸澈的水底偶然倒映着一片飄過的白雲，一切都像喪失了自己的聲音，等到河岸上廻蕩着不斷的急促底燦竹聲響的時候，我知道街道上這時又是一批被歡送的征兵走過去了，這些寒夢中的人們啊，會不會正在縈廻着他們徜徉在沙灘上的童年？……。廖旅長顧書記長在蘇北　（本報泰縣記者凌松壽擁攝）</p>

<p>衛生與医药從中美商約說到取締秘藥  猷先　　中美商約最近已經在南京簽署，並經立法院通過。國內各界人士對這件新約的看法，見仁見智，褒貶不一。實在從表面上看，固是平等互惠，但是因爲兩方的國力懸殊，弱者是註定了要吃大虧的。「自己努力」說來好聽，談何容易。　　在醫言醫。以中國醫藥之缺，人民之衆，每年藥械類商品入口之多，其數字一定是大得驚人。可惜手下缺乏海關入口的統計材料，不能舉出確實的數目，以爲左證。大約的估計，總要在幾萬萬億以上。希望國人不要忽視了這一筆漏巵。　　藥品是醫療疾病的，不可一日或缺，我們自已的醫藥落伍，自不得不仰給於人。但是在這個時代，醫藥是十足的商業化了。何者可用，何者必需，方可准其入口。我們必須取得主動。那些有名無實的秘藥，以假混眞的贗品，非徒枉耗病家的金錢，甚且貽誤患者的性命，應予絕對禁止　　美國政府對於他們本國的人民，很能盡到保護之責。旣不許假藥混入市塲，更不容成藥做非分的宣傳，他們有三道防綫，以限制那奸滑的藥商。第一道防綫是郵政局拒寄不合法的成藥。第三道防綫是他們設有專門管理食品和藥物的機關，時時在注意有害的，虛偽的或是冒牌的藥品，不但禁止運輸，而日時常搜査藥鋪。第三道防綫是聯邦貿易委員會時時在査考各種報紙，雜誌和無綫電台的廣吿。不許有不實而誇大的宣傳。但是他們這種工作是片面的，專爲保護他們本國的人民。任何外國人都不在其內。一九三九年六月通過的聯邦食品藥物化裝品管理條例內，有這樣的一段：　　『出口之食品，藥物或化裝品，如有下列情形之一者，得不以偽造或冒牌論：　　一，如外國之購買人所指明者。　　二，不違反輸入國之法律者　　三，包裝外面註明「專供輸出　者。」　　聰明的美國政各，爲他們的藥商，開了道三個方便之門，於是美國國境以內所不容許的秘製藥，冒牌的，攙假的，騙人的，都輸出到國外去了，大中華民國當然是最好的市塲之一。　　劣藥專供出口　落後國家當心　　根據美國一個上等的雜誌所披露的消息，有一次美國一個大業廠爲海陸軍所定製的盤尼西林，經官方檢騐員認爲不合，拒却了一大批。當然那是不適於用，某有害程度，或可致人於死。但是加上了「專供出口」的字條，就都連往南美洲去，以超出原値的高價售與醫院和開業的醫師們了。　　中國抗戰尙未結束，昆明和重慶的市面上，就有了盤尼西林。奇怪！盟國軍用的盤尼西林，每感不足。怎麽不加統制，竟任其流入黑市？日寇投降未久上海天津也湧到了大批的盤尼西林。使人不禁有「司馬大兵，來得好快」的感想。結果，許多的醫師都說：「效用並不甚好」！一百聞不如一試」。這是一般的批評。焉知賣與我們的不也是一些廢物？　　根據同一來源的消息，曾有許多千包的紗布繃帶，因爲未經適當的方法消毒，被美國政府的檢騐員退回廠方。於是貼上了「專供出口」的字條，就都銷售到外國去了。　　芝加哥有一家藥廠調製了一種危險的墮胎劑，可能對於孕婦引起嚴重的危害，甚或致死。美國的法律禁止出售，但是那廠家很容易的將英文的瓶籤換爲外國字，轉向異邦人去賣，依舊可發一筆大財。有一種成藥，據說能使白髮變黑，但是美國國內不許做這樣的虛僞宣傳，然而若是「專供出口」，美國政府却不禁止廠商製造。類似的實例很多。紐的洛杉磯等，一些工業城市，近年來澎湃汹湧，幾乎成了出口假藥的製造中心。美國官方稽査員密切的監視着他們，不讓這些以害人來騙錢的秘製藥流人國內的市塲。　　秘藥宣傳　相得益彰　　製造出口秘藥最大的一家美國藥廠，出到二十歲種秘藥。每月在拉丁美洲的幾家日報上要消耗到三千美金的廣吿費，宣傳這些騙錢的假藥，是如何的科學而有效。有的能治腎病，有的能使胖子變瘦，有的可以返老還童，有的可以减低血壓。治心痛的，治頭暈的，治頭痛的，花樣齊全。但是據美國官方檢騐員說：『全是胡說，完全是欺騙人呢？』　　有一種專爲補血補腦用的秘藥，據廣吿上說。裏邊含有奎寗和一些別的好聽的東西，功效能增加體力，促進活力，大病之後，可以帮助復原。賣價是三元美金一瓶。靠了廣吿的吹噓宣傳，每年在拉丁美洲可以銷售幾百萬瓶。裏邊究竟有些甚麽東西呢？據美國官方的檢騐員說：『裏邊並沒有奎寗，主要的材料是酒精，的計百分之十一。』　　暫且放下美國，回頭看一看我們自己。科學的醫藥，雖是落伍，專賣秘藥　錢的奸商，却是多如過江之鯽，治喘有藥，治瘋有藥，化痰有藥，補虛有藥，有治小兒百病的藥，有治婦科百病的藥。祇要有病名，就可有藥買。誰說中國醫藥不發達！　病是天下各國都無藥可治的，但是在中國却不難找到幾百種包括治肺癆的妙藥。取締的條文，　有規定，祇是不見施行。　　美國的不正當藥商受了法律的限制，是向國外殺展，我們的不正當藥商則是靠了上邊的昏庸和下邊的愚昧，專在國內欺騙自己的同胞，吸吮本族的血液。這樣內外夾攻，中國的病人，怎樣受得了？目前的問題是「我們怎樣辦？」　　衛生署當局請防患未然　　屬文至此，見報載衛生署將於十一月十九，廿兩日在滬召開藥政座談會。結果如何，事前固不可知，然就所佈座談項目揣測，殊無斷然處置之意，就筆者個人管見所及，以一個醫帥的立塲，認爲執政當局應於下列對策擇一從遠施行：　　（一）華業國營　無論　售運銷，統由國家經營。杜絕一切非法來源。僅以價廉有效而必需之藥品供歷國內。若能醫藥同時國營，尤爲澈底，易收實效。旣可减少浪費，亦得節制消耗。非但每年可以儉省千萬億元的虛靡，而國內外的秘藥惡風，乃得根本剷除。此爲上策。　　（二）禁絕秘藥　秘製成藥，建禁止。國內不得製售，國外亦不許入口，中華藥典應即嚴格修訂，務求單純，重實際。合乎科學，確實有效而必需者存之。餘者掃數淘汰。此後國內製售，國外輸入，槪以藥典爲限。遇有國內發明新藥，非經中央醫學機關硏究證明，確實有效，呈奉中央主管當局明令特許，不得銷售或登報宣傳。如能嚴格執行，當不失爲善策。　　（三）嚴格檢騐　仿照美國辦法，凡食物，藥劑以及化妝品類，無論出於國內或來自國外，均須經過檢騐，確不含有害物質，而名符其實者，始准銷售。惟成藥製造步驟必須呈報主管機關，於一定之年限內准予專利保障。所含主要成份必須在仿單或瓶籤上註明，俾購服者，確知內係何物，定價應受限制，宣傳不得誇張。此種辦法，漏洞甚多，防範須嚴。化騐工作，尤必繁重。人力物力，所費甚多，極難做到好處。然而若能努力以赴，仍不失爲一條中策。　　至若現行的辦法，空有取締的明文，實則放任自由，甚或不問有無實效，竟濫發許可執照，任其誇大宣傳。民衆反以爲旣經政府許可，想必可靠。這實在是下下之策，反不如政府完全聲明不管，聽憑人民自行辨別，願者上鈎，自家負責。吃了虧無可怨尤。然而衛生當局，豈眞是這樣無能呢？　　眼看美國各樣的商品已是大量的湧來。海運已是暢通。美國國內所不容許的無用垃圾，沿着「專供出口」的大道，擎着「平等互惠」的大　，披着美麗的科學外衣，哼着迷人的誘惑歌曲，向由國缺衣少食，呻吟在病痛中的患者進攻，逼索超格的代價！縱然不爲每年千萬億的漏巵惜，難倒就一點也不顧念那在病中掙扎的民衆麼？賢明的執政者！請動一動罷、談談戴眼鏡  陳道瑜　　視力的不正常是由於眼睛有近視遠視或散光所致，誰都知道戴眼鏡是可以矯正的。然而視力不正常的人，都不願意戴鏡子，其原因，一方面由於沒有養成戴鏡的習慣，一方面以爲常戴眼鏡的人光度會更增加，更有一般人，如年靑小姐們，認爲戴眼鏡對於個人的儀表美姿有所妨碍，因有此種種的錯誤觀念，不知有多少人把他們本來可以矯正的視力變成了不可醫治，以致對於個人健康影響很大，現在麒就管見所及，對這問題簡述如下：　　眼科醫師將近視，遠視，或散光的光度矯正之後，總是苦口婆心的向病人解釋戴眼鏡並且要常戴的理由，到底戴鏡子有甚麽益處呢？　　1可以矯正視力——矯正視力，是戴眼鏡的主要目的，戴上合適的眼鏡以後，就可以把一切景物淸淸楚楚的看出來，好像到了新環境裏面一樣，他所得到的快樂，常然是可想而知的。因此可以推想他在未戴眼鏡以前所受的無形痛苦了。但是視力不正常不是戴了眼鏡都可以矯正的。這原因並不是某某眼科醫生騐光有錯誤，實在是因爲眼睛有其他的疾病。或者因爲戴眼鏡過遲，眼球內部的組織已經有了變化而不可醫治，這樣的眼睛醫學上稱爲弱視眼，這是不戴眼鏡的結果，也就是不戴眼鏡的害處，常戴眼鏡雖然有時光度仍舊可以增加，但是他的視力却可保持正常的。但若成了弱視眼，則其所受的痛苦實不堪設想啊！　　2可以減除病症——視力不正常的人，除感覺看東西不太淸楚外，並且常常會引起許多病症來，像頭痛。眼睛脹痛。噁心。嘔吐。消化不良等，都是最常看見的有遠視眼的人，這些病症更加厲害，因此病人往往首先請內科醫生診治，殊不知他的病完全是由於眼睛的屈光不正常所發生的。一旦戴上合適的眼鏡，則病症就漸消失了，這種病倒隨時可以遇着，又假若小孩有視力不正常的毛病而不去矯正，這對他的害處比較成年人更大，可使他的精神萎靡，發育不全，尤其可以影響他的天資聰慧，除此以外，兩眼可能成爲斜眼。若是由於視力不正常而引起的，應該在發現較早的時候就去請眼科醫生診治。　　3可以預防眼部外傷——兩隻眼球常常與外界接觸，稍微不小心就可以受傷。例如我們在飛沙的環境下行走。沙石很容易吹入眼內而引起眼病。又如在有爆炸性的危險地方工作，則常有因發生爆炸而使眼睛受傷的情形，病人可因此而成爲瞎子。這不但喪失了他終生的幸福，而且在經濟上的損失，也實在無法估計，若是戴上了眼鏡，則這種意外可以避免的。　　二·怎樣選擇眼鏡　　前面已經把戴鏡的益處大略說明了，但是怎樣才能够達到那些目的呢？無疑問的就是選擇合適眼鏡，所以我們要談的第二個問題，就是選擇合適眼鏡應該注意那些條件。　　1光度應該合適——光度合適是選擇眼鏡最重要的條件，戴着不合適的眼鏡，便有前面已經說過的種種不良結果。但是許多人都不知道光度的重要性，常常隨便請眼鏡商人去配光，這樣眞是太不注重自己的健康了，要知道眼鏡商人並不是眼科醫生，騐光是不會精確的，舉個例來說吧，若有遠視眼的人請眼鏡商人去配光，一定要把人弄得莫明其妙，因爲鏡片戴上後，視力反更糢糊了，結果他一定請你到某醫院眼科去騐光，因爲眼科醫生騐光的方法與眼鏡商人是不同的，是要先査明病人的光度，再戴上他所合適的鏡片光度自然很精確，目前一般人把戴眼鏡這樁事，看得太不要緊，好像到鞋店去買鞋子一樣的隨便，大概合適穿了就走，以這樣的觀念去配眼鏡，這是大大的錯誤，我們今後一定要矯正這種壞習慣，眼鏡一定要先經眼科醫生騐光方可戴，有時視力不正常，並不都是由於屈光關係，也可以由於患有其他底眼病，眼科醫生可爲你詳細檢査早給你醫治，這是請眼科醫生來騐光的另外一個好處。　　2鏡片的選擇——鏡片好壞，對於視力影響沒有光度不合適那樣嚴重，最要注意的就是鏡片的屈光要均勻一致，好鏡片四週的屈光與鏡片中央部分是一樣的，道樣可以使看的範圍旣廣而且淸晰。　　3鏡框的選擇——鏡框的功用除了，可以保持鏡片在一定的位置之外還可以保護眼鏡不容易損壞，所以常爲一般人採用，牠的質料可分爲兩種，一種是金屬的，如鋁，銀，鋼，或白金等，另一種是非金屬的，如玳瑁假象牙等，這兩種質料不同的鏡框，各有其缺點，非金屬鏡框的鏡脚不能緊懸在耳後，鏡樑容易滑下，常常需要用手向上推到合適的地方，金屬鏡框中，鋁與銀質做的容易彎曲，鋼做的容易銹折，其中以白金的爲最佳，但貨値太貴，非一般公敎人負所能購買，依我個大的意見，還是買非金屬的好一點，價錢比較便宜，效用相差有限至於小孩所戴的眼鏡，鏡框應該堅牢耐久。　　4眼鏡的位置——眼鏡最適合的位置是把鏡片的中心正對着瞳孔，離眼不可太遠，要恰好使鏡片與睫毛不相接觸，因爲要視力淸楚，鏡片一定要與視綫成爲直角。　　5眼鏡大小形式——關於眼鏡的形式大小因各人的歡喜與臉面輪廓而不同，這層對於視力並不重要現不多述。　　6光度應校騐——眼鏡公司配眼鏡有時在無意中會把左右鏡片互相放錯，尤其有散光的鏡片，只要散光軸稍有錯誤，則視力必大受影響，所以配了眼鏡以後，應該請眼科醫生校騐一次，檢査光度與原來的是否相同，一副眼鏡戴到二年以上，就必要重新檢査一次眼睛的光度，這也是很重要的。　　三結論　　近視遠視或散光眼必須常戴合適的眼鏡否則會影響個人的健康。日本吸血蟲  殷綏和　　前幾天看到報紙上載有一節關於蘇州四鄕角直，木凟，黄棣等地，發現日本吸血蟲症，患者甚衆；因舍間正居是區，故而特地選擇本文，登載報端，供奉鄕間親友，以作參考。　　日本吸血蟲是長不及半寸，粗不及繼針大小的一種寄生蟲，他散佈在亞洲各地；中國，日本，菲利濱，都有他的踪跡，中國的長江兩岸，一直從宜昌到上海，更其是他繁殖的地城，蘇州四鄕，在最近幾年中是愈來愈多了。他在無影無踪的中間，每年不知殺害了多少生命。他不獨侵害人類，牛，羊，猪，狗，等動物都有權此病症的。　　吾們先謂這種寄生蟲的生活史。倘若從他的卵談起，那他的卵是產生在病人的糞便裏，他們同大便一起從腸子裏排洩了出來，在河浜的汚水裘長成幼蟲，侵入特種螺絲（Oncomelanis）的軟體，經過六十天的長育，變成了第二期的幼蟲，離開螺絲，在水裏游着；但是他的體積，還比不上針頭那麼大小，所以肉眼是看不見的，那一班在河浜裏游泳的孩子，田裏工作的農民，溪水裏洗條約女工們，都是他找尋的目標，他從表皮上鑽進人體，跟着血流，深入肺臟，然後再從動脈血管裏一溜溜進了肝臟，他在那裏就作久居之計，發育長大，變成了成蟲，雌雄雙雙的交配起來了，這個過程，一共大約要費他三十來天的樣子，從第五個星期起，雌蟲就開始產卵。他的產科醫院，設在腸壁裏面，當他要產卵的時候，他還要費一些精力，從肝裏爬了出來，經過一段血管的旅程，跑到腸壁的毛細管血管裏，然後產下他的卵來，他好　是眞有腦筋的東西，他還會爲着下一代的出路着想；因爲將來他的卵，還要穿破腸釐，混在眞　裏出來，　世代代的和人類結仇恨，他在產過罪之後，依舊要　　肝臟、只有一班少數懶惰的鼻子，那他就在肝裏產卵了。　　吸血蟲在人的身體　好像　游　界式的東奔西跑，但他的寄主，眞可受不住了，祇要　一聲光　，不　那　健康的人們，就要　　疾　；要不了一個短短的時期，他就會骨瘦如柴；在幾年的中間，他就會傷失了他的生命，這個疾病的　像，大槪可以分爲三期：第一期是幼蟲侵入後的一個月頭，在這個時期裏，病人患風疹，發熱，肚痛，咳嗆，倘若　起血來，可以看見嗜紅性白血球大大的增加，第二期是便血，便　；因爲蟲卵是在突破腸壁而出來了，然後病人體力日下，病　　　露，脾臟腫大了，肝臟也　了，如此者三四年後，肝臟慢慢碘化起來，腹部生水，肚子大起來了，脚也腫了。這是已經到了末期的徵像，換句話說，就已經成了不治之症，再也沒有復原的機會了。　　這樣講起來，那不是危險極了！鄕村裏旣沒有自來水，人民怎樣能不同河水接觸；還有田野間苦心耕種的農民，怎樣可以和水分離呢？在這種晨村經濟狀况之下，怎樣能希望他們就用機器來代替人工呢？所以這眞是一個很難解決的問題，最理想的辦法，當然是希望會同當地衛生行政當局，設法用化學藥品來殺滅那種中間物的特種螺絲，這種寄生蟲的生活史中斷了，他自然可以滅跡。倘若一時不容易辦到的話，祇能在消極預防方式上着手，就是（一）禁止兒童入水游泳；（二）一切用水需加明礬，漂粉之類殺蟲；（三）飲水需煮沸，（四）凡患此病者，需極早治療，一則以防不治，再則杜絕蟲卵的產生，以防傳染他人；（五）病人大便需加消毒以殺蟲卵；（六）田畝間採用石灰以作肥料等。醫壇新話國藥常山中之有效成分　  雲　　常山產於西南各省，有抗瘧之功效，久爲國人所注重。衛生署中央衛生實騐院歷年來將常山作一有系統之化學與藥理之試騐，幷發現四種結晶品，其中之一確有抗瘧作　。今該機關由渝遷京後，將常山作進一步之研究。化學一方面，在國立北平硏究院藥物硏究所趙承　博士指導之下，已得一純粹之有效成分，命名「大可因」（Dichroine），其分子式爲Cl6H19O3N3，熔點爲一百四十五度，極易溶解於水。藥理一方面，由國立上海醫學院張昌紹博士主持進行。不久當有一較詳細之報吿，供醫藥界人士之參考也。紅血球沉降率與惡性腫痬  紹　　紅血球沉降率（Sedimention）之檢定乃法來烏斯（Fahraeus）于一九一八年所曾倡，用作妊娠的診斷。不久，即發現此率於各種炎症時亦然繪　，在診斷上及預後決定上頗有價値。最近各家報吿，此率於惡性腫瘍之病例，其增高常較炎症病例更爲顯著，但良性腫痬則無此現象。故於腫瘍之良性惡性鑑別診斷時，此率之檢定，極有帮助。外表上診爲良性腫瘍之病例，如有增高之紅血球沉降率，即有續發傳染或惡性變化之嫌疑。於惡性腫痬病例，如沉降率繼續增高，或突然上昇，則有腫痬組織遷徙之嫌疑。於手術病例，如腫痬已完全切除，則沉降率應於六麗期內恢復正常。如能繼續保持正常至六月，則預後大致佳良。如沉降率不恢復正常，則指手術並不成功，腫痬組織尙未除盡。若已達正常水準後，又復增高，則指腫瘍組織遷徙或復發，係預後不良之兆。卵巢移植  　　最近美國紙海文獸醫診所所長灰得來氏報吿，渠於家犬施行之卵巢移植實騐已吿成功。灰氏及他人之早期實騐，因未顧到犬之生理週期，故均失敗。此次供給與接受卵巢之犬，均選定在求偶期內，成功之秘訣亦在於是。將甲大之卵巢移植於乙犬後，乙犬之性慾週期，即失去其原來之特點，而完全追從甲犬之週　靑微素與腹膜炎  紹　　由腹內臟器潰孔所致之腹膜炎，向不認爲靑微素（配尼西林）之適應證。蓋潰孔後竄入腹腔之大腸菌等不僅能抗拒靑黴素之作用，且能破與靑黴素而使之失效。但此種理論今爲事實所擊破矣。　　Fauley等於一九四四年底，即已於動物實騐證明靑黴素對於腹膜炎之療效。氏等將案犬之闌尾結紮，使壞死潰裂而實騐的產生瀰漫性腹膜炎。不施治療之二十七犬中死者佔92.6％。另于四十八犬，則於結紮後一小時即給靑黴素，結果無一死者。第三組之十九犬，則靑　素之治療延至結紮後十二小時，始行開始，其死亡率亦得銳减至21％。　　去年三月間，Craig氏報吿闌尾破裂所致之腹膜炎病人七例，經靑黴素治療後，均得救。　　最近Ｃｒｉｌｅ氏報吿腹膜炎五十例，瀰漫性者與限局性者各半，均併發於闌尾炎。經靑黴素治療後，均迅速見效，無一死亡。所用靑　素劑量，較普通爲大，每二小時肌肉注射十萬單位，或用靜脈內滴入法給之。至少連用六日。除一例外，全部病例於治療第四日大見减輕；一半病例於第五日即無熱度。　　總之，無論動物實騐或臨床實騐，均能確實證明靑黴素之療效，對於蘭尾潰裂昕致之腹膜炎亦甚良好。皮膚炎  蔣以楷　　「發炎」這個名詞，讀者恐怕都很熟悉。狹義的講法，是因爲細菌侵入組織後引起毛細管的反應，血淸及一部份白血球從血管　出，多核性細胞及淋巴球大量聚集於組織內，以反抗外來的侵略者，若體內防禦力量薄弱，則此種發炎之現象蔓延，反之，則此種「發炎」現象消退。若以廣義的說法來講「發炎」，外來的侵略者，不一定是細菌，其他外來的刺激都可以，或者是屬於物理性的「光綫」，或者從過敏情或藥理性的反應而產生，皮膚炎最多數的原因還是歸咎於這種過敏性反應而來的刺激，與普通外科上「發炎」的原因，完全不同，（按外科上「發炎」，大多數的原因，還是細菌性的）。　　這種外來刺激不外下列幾種：（一）藥物外用內服注射或化學品的蒸氣，化學工業品直接接觸皮膚。（二）物理性——日光。（三）食品。（四）一切日常接觸物，或環境的週圍，只要於皮膚不合的都可以。皮膚炎在上海各大醫院的病例實在太多了，的占全體皮膚病百分之五十以上，茲就通常所見的幾種，略述如下；　　第一種是局部的皮膚炎，這種比較輕的病人，局部面部頸部及上肢發紅，往往與正常皮膚有淸晰分界，病人自覺異癢，妨害正常工作及睡眠，短期內一二天蔓延至其他部份此時若及早治療，此種「發炎」現象很快消退下去，否則「發炎」現象愈來愈大。「發炎」處除發紅外，尙有大量粘液流出。　　第二種「皮膚炎」是全身四肢粘膜無一倖免，皮膚上的疹班，有類似麻症或類似猩紅熱疹，有時竟有水泡，病人全身發熱，有時很高39度C以上，初起時或有腸胃症象，如嘔吐及腹瀉，此時最好請有經騐的皮膚病醫生來診斷一下以便與其他傳染病鑑別。若及早找出原因治療極容易，此病多數由於內脹某種藥品與病人體質不合而發生的一種過敏性的皮膚反應，少數亦因腸胃失常而引起此種反應，輓近化學品治療日新月異。一般病人相信某種藥物的萬能——硫化物，不間該病是否需要，藥石亂投，服後即有不適合現象亦不加注意，作者曾見病人因患頸部濕症而不服其硫化物，另一病人因患疥瘡，誤信報上廣吿，服用疥瘡內服藥（毒特靈）以致釀成全身皮膚炎臥病在床數星期，因此引起肺病復發，諸是此類，不知凡幾。　　第三種皮膚炎，是此較最嚴重的脫皮性「皮膚炎」，大都由於病人誤信注射萬能，或濫施注射砒劑或服用重價金屬藥品，作者曾見病人因皮膚濕症濫施砒製劑注射，以致發生全身剝皮性「皮膚炎」而喪生。此病多數因病人與砒製劑有特異性反應，注射後而發生，此病初起時（注射後數小時內）全身發冷發熱，全身異癢，並發現類似猩紅疹，若不及時治療，入後全身紅腫，全身出水，有時甚至肝臟腫大，眼白發黄，病人因此而送命者不少，若病人能安渡此時期，則出水停止，全身滿蓋皮屑，一面脫皮一面長，皮屑大小不一，大者有如手套型，小者有如麥片，如此可繼續至數月之久，此時護理非常重要，否則併發症極易發生，此病全程至少需一二個月，多至半年以上，亦未可知。　　綜上所述三種皮膚炎，重則喪生，輕者妨書工作，精神物質兩遭損失，總之無論那種極小的皮膚病，切不可以自己濫用藥膏或內服藥品，更不可妄用注射劑，最好到大醫院請皮膚科發生來下一個診斷，給予合理的治療。</p>

<p>春秋文藝的使命  王平陵　　辛克萊曾經說：「凡是文藝是宣傳。」這句話，頗爲少數藝術至上主義者——即爲文藝而文藝的作家們所不滿意，原因是文藝還有更主要的任務在，那就是如何陶冶高尙的情緒，型鑄健全的人格，使生命發出光輝，導引自己向眞美善的路途，找尋靈魂的寄托。如果文藝的使命，僅是爲了達成宣傳的任務，未免小視文藝的價値了。宣傳的方法有的是，　　　　藝術之神呢？乾脆利用廣告，豈不更便捷。　　大約這一派的作家，最討厭批評家把他們的作宣傳品，其實，許多粗製濫造的詩敎，小說和戲劇，所以沒有什麼價値，就因爲未能達成宣傳的任務。有一種文藝作品要是眞能陶冶情緒，型鑄人格的話，正是這處作品能夠發生宣傳作用的有力的證據。　　辛克萊的　　，我敢肯定地說，決沒有侮辱文藝的意思，實在是給文藝以新的估價，更加董文藝界對時代對人生所應負的責任。試問，在文藝史上公認爲不朽的名著中，能有幾首詩，機種小說和劇本，算是達成宣傳的任務呢？　　文藝要達成宣傳的任務，是作家們一件非常艱鉅的工作，至少，缺乏藝術的素養，純熟的技巧，尤其是忽略現實，毫無生活經騐的作家們，休想使寫出的作品。達成某種宣傳的效果的。　　文藝的使命，旣在使作品盡到宣傳的能事，那麼，宣傳必須講時效，必須適合當前最迫切的需要，選定最嚴重的課題，作澈頭澈尾的解答。不，就無法達成宣傳的任務。所謂不朽的作品，並無神秘性，簡單明瞭地說；便是宣傳的時效比較久的作品。　　以上的話，假使能獲得作家們的共鳴，我就要問：在戰後的中國，應該首先在一切文藝武式中力圖解答的課題，是什麼呢？文藝工作者衹要跑到十字街口，跑到蒼涼的原野，看見那些破爛的廢墟，聽到凄絕入寰的飢餓的呼聲，必能找到一個十分適切的回答：「第一是發展生產，第二是發展生產，第三，第四……還是發展生產。」中國打了八年的大仗，打得一貧如洗了，此刻什麼都是空的，祇有救窮第一，要救窮，就必須發展生產。文藝工作者誠欲在國內外的情勢演變到親階段的中國，達成文藝的使命，就必須執着這一個最嚴重的課題，拋出最響亮的聲音，發出總動員的號召。　　前嚴年在重慶的全國文協總會會主催過一次大規模的文藝座談會，一致主張把文藝的各部門配合生產建設的國策，努力恢宏宣傳的實效。主張最力的是老舍，他說：「作家們雖對抗戰出了力，有了不可磨滅的貢獻，可是，在生產建設方面，一點表現都沒有，連我自己也是沒有表現的一個。」由於老舍的強調說明，便把這一個傾向，成爲今後文藝創作的一條新道路，雖然，時至今日尙未發現文藝工作者已經走上這修表道路。　　戰前，盟邦蘇聯在接連三個五年計劃的實施時，確能動員文藝界奔赴生產的戰綫，使他們盡量運用各種文藝的形式——特別是電影戲與小說，鼓舞人民對於生產發生熱烈的興趣，提高工人們工作的效率。像士敏土，處女地，發電廠……這些有名的長篇，都是適應蘇聯生產建設的國策出現於文壇。我覮得在戰後的中國，這一種新作風，實應爲作家們所取法。　　在此刻，攫在中國地面上的一切，連憧憧管理方式來的人物也在內，能夠呌人滿意的東西，眞是少得可憐；不過，我們無須過於悲觀，中國畢竟是得天獨厚的國家，在地球上所處的進位，在太陽下所照到的緯度，確實是「頂好，」雖爲那些不肖的孽子乾孫所作踐，卻爲有心人所痛惜；所以，我們要在作品中畫出新中國未來的遠景，誘設民衆們努力生產的熱情，描寫已在進行中的大工程，如何克股工作的困難，增加工作者的勇氣，我們更要在著有成績的工程師和勞働者之中，選出若干代表人物來，作爲我們親捍代的新英雄，謳歌他們給予人類的幸福，讚美他們自我犧甡的精神，崇拜他們在工作上所獲得的新發明。　　作家們急於要誘導有能力，有才識，有專技的人們，齊奔赴生產的戰綫，在碚栽國族的元氣上多做工夫；千萬不要削尖了頭亮，拼合向政治的牛角尖裏鑽，充當政治的擔客和敗子。我們要老老實實吿訴有志氣有希望的下一代，千萬不要再走這一代的孽子孽孫們所走過的錯路和絕路！這是現階段一個不可動搖的眞理，站在時代前衛的文藝工作者必須大聲疾呼，竭盡可能，透過文藝的諸種形式，讓民們有深刻的認識，沉痛的警覺！計談片  林風　　想想吧—什麼能使人的心跳足心？什麼能使人的心溫暖？什麼能使人的惱火爲熱？什麼能使人的心明亮？什麼能使人的心接獨到另一人心的招引？什麼能使人的心和人類萬棵心交流？什麼能使人的心和宇宙萬有—無論一片石，一棵草—互相默契？　　我的回答，只有詩。博物志抄  法·茹爾·雷納的作　戴望舒譯　　一·蝴蝶　　這張對摺的情書在找一個花的地址。　　二·螢　　什麼事？已經是晚上九點鐘了，它那裏還有燈火。　　三·貓　　我的那隻是不吃老鼠的；它不喜歡吃。它紙捉一隻玩玩罷了。　　當它玩暢了的時候，就饒了它的命，而到雖處去夢想，這個天東西，坐在它自己的尾巴圈子裏，頭結實得像一個拳頭。　　可是，國爲它的爪子的緣故，老鼠死了。　　四·母雞　　當人們把門一打開的時候，她便立刻從鷄　並着腳跳了出來。　　這是一隻平常的母鷄，妝扮得很儉欉，而且從來也不后金蛋。　　給陽光眩了眼，她在院子裏躊躇地走了幾步。　　她先看見那一個灰堆——每天早晨，她是慣常在那裏打滾的。　　她就在那裏打滾，在那裏　伏，然後鼓起着毛羽，用一種劇烈的振翼，去抖散她的夜間的蛋虱。　　接着她便到給最近的大雨所注滿了水的深盆裏去欽水。　　她祗喝水。　　她一小口一小口地喝着，又堅起項頸來，腳停在盆邊上。　　接着她便去找她的四散的糧食。　　細草是她所有的，政治家比蟲和散失的米粒。　　她不倦地啄着，啄着。　　不時地，她停住了。　　直立着，戴着她的　　季帽子，眼睛靈活，喉　堂皇，她用這一令耳朶聽，又用那一隻耳朶聽。　　而在確定沒有什麼新鮮的東西的時候，她便又去尋找了。　　她高高地舉起她的僵硬的腳，好樣生關節炎的人似的。她張開她的足趾，然後小心地，無聲地把它們放下去。　　人們竟可以說，她是在赤着腳走路。　　五·松鼠　　翎毛啊！翎毛啊！是啊，當然囉；可是，我的小朋友，那不是插在這個地方的。　　六·翠鳥　　今天下午，魚沒有上鈎，可是我卻帶了一種罕有的情緒回來。　　正當我把竿垂釣的時候，一隻羣鳥飛來停在我的釣竿上。　　我們是沒有比這更燦潤的鳥兒了。　　它像是一朶長莖稍頭的靑色的花。釣竿在它的重量之下變下去。我連篇累牘呼也停上合并。　百自傲被一隻翠鳥當做了一棵樹。　　而且我可以斷言，它決定不是因爲害怕而飛去了的，它以爲祗是從這一枝飛到一枝罷了。掙扎  宋夢芹　　那是鬧市的一角。　　行人梭樣的來去穿動，沒有一刻間斷偶然選會感覺擠。雖然有靠右行的路章，自由空氣中的自由人們，似乎認爲那是太多事。他們各自走各自的路，無分左右與東西，這正是他們自由精神充分的表現，與無言抵抗的忠厚處。大大小小的吉普車、汽車、三輪車、人力車、老虎車和電車，若你不能定神來揣幕牠們的首尾，你是難分牠們的方向，路旁的店舖和貨攤雖的固定的位置，而他們的負責人依舊在那可能的小圈裏，盡力的活動。鬧市自是一個動的空間，裏面的人們，也許正在暗恨不曾生出三頭六臂。　　當你偶然稍一佳足，也許你是有些倦乏了。攤販們立刻集攤來，越集越多。　　金山蘋果，要　？眞正金山的！」　　「清水蟹，賤呀！一千五一只，要　！」　　「玻璃皮包，買一只吧，只要一萬九千洋鈿！」　　你若不能趕緊打算出路，團困是有可能的。可是你的聰明一啓轉過身來才打算走下行人道，移向馬路中間時，另一批的善意的承應者，開始熱烈的問顧你：　　「黃包車嗎？並不慢哪！」　　「三輪車　　？國際飯店嗎？」　　如果你是才從鄕間來上海的人，這個迷陣要使你難以擺脫了。　　最奇怪的是　道的中間，居然擺起一架爐鍋，設下桌凳，成功了個臨時餐廳。那是賣生熟蟹的。在桌的中央懸起一只電燈，外面卻套起了彩色綢紮的一隻大蟹，一百是靑緣色，另一面是杏紅色，表示蟹有生熟的營業性。的確上海是商業都市，就這偶然的現象，多麼表示出他們商來原理的了解程度的深厚。更奇怪的是桌的中央，安置了三盆菊花，這清謂又是多麼清幽與羅逸。一圈人坐在那裏把酒，持整而常菊。悠悠然似乎是熟視不覩泰山，靜聽不聞街霆。　　不知什麼時候，群眾基礎亂的人們似是做了有秩序的圍團，後來者也在次第的加添人層厚度。並不知道中間是什麼要戲，只聽見觀望的人們的鼓當與喝采，忽然人堆中滾出了一個人團傳乎是兩個人扭做一團。滾到了路中心。緊接着原有的人圈，自動的移了過去。　　「這是何苦！爲了一隻蟹，攤子也不要了。」一個酒客，在難息，可是依然不忘記蟹爪裏任何一節肉，耐心的剔着。　　「人就都憑着一口氣，誰有受委曲？」又一個酒客說着滿上了一杯汪。仍舊不失悠悠然氣概。　　那幾簍大蟹，可是開始在翻動了。下面的想向上，上面的想出頭。經過了一個不長也不短的時間的掙扎，到衝開了繼索爬了出來。小孩子們眼睛是銳的，他們在喊「好」的餘閑，用了鼓黨的餘力，提起了兩隻腳就跑。接着另一孩子又是兩隻，……從此再也不聞「好」聲堂聲了。　　「不拿，不拿也是跑掉了！」　　「對！跑掉不要緊，還會到處去　人呢！」　　說着，一堆大人也提了幾只。於是蔞裏蟹儘管向外爬，人們也儘管方便的提了去，而簍氐底的蟹依舊在向上層　動着。　　鍋子裏的才放進的蟹，也在索索的響動，扎掙在鍋邊縫隙處的蟹爪，顏色分明半黃了。可是依然在動。　　持蟹賞菊畢竟是風雅舉動，舉動風雅的畢竟是高士了。於是高士閃在慨歡了：　　掙扎啊！掙扎而爲生，抑或生而爲掙扎！　　可是大蟹們不響，並且也不曾想。秋聲賦意  　　一寸山河一寸血　107  葉動風　　　萍子說到這裏，暫時停頓了一下，兩隻點漆般的眼睛，在鶴見臉上搜索着，希望找出一些反應來。鶴見聽了這些話，心望找出一些反應來。鶴見聽了這些話，心下當然也有一陣翻騰，神色上當然也有些變化。不過這種變化，無論萍子怎樣總明，也琢磨不出一個究竟。鶴見並非一個老奸巨猾；而且他是一個堂堂男子，也用不着裝出許多奸狡面孔，來欺瞞一個女子。僅僅因爲他本身的問題太複群眾基礎，所以神情上的表現也複雜，萍子一時卻如何看得出來？　　「至於今天這個局面，」萍子綱續說下去，「我是受的雙重命令！從職務上說，我本來不應把話告訴你。不過從我對你大哥崇拜的心表上說，我又不得不先報一個警吿！」　　「　……？」鶴見終久有些鎭定不住了。　　「會裏的大部重要人物，爲了大哥的突然參加，起了兩派的意見：一部分說大哥是「純粹份子」，一部分卻是有些猜疑。幸虧擁護「純粹」方面的力量大；所以大哥很快的經過了「五級測騐」。試當然也是由於大哥的天資秉賦，不同尋常。」　　萍子說到這裏，不知爲了什麼，忽然低下了頭，頰上泛起一層紅雲，有些情不自勝似的。從第三者來看，萍子是在春蠶自縛，情情願願地做了鶴見的情俘了。　　不過秘密工作人物中，一切行動，都要單上一兩重，甚至三五重掩飾，誰能斷定萍子眞個崇拜鶴見，到了一見傾心的地步？況且，偈萍子的職務，最大的忌諱，就是談情說愛。縱令在某種塲合之中，也免不了要唱一齣佳期期密約的戲，那紙是一處取得目的物的勾魂手段而已，哪事能把來當作眞情實事？況且鶴見這種織錚錚的漢子，一片心血熱誠，整個獻給了祖國，連耀羣那樣的意中人，都趨避不遑，哪裏還有心思，來理會萍子這種突如其來的愛情製擊？所以說，萍子是在春蠶自縛，也僅是一種揣度罷了。　　「我所接受的命令，」萍子漸漸抬起頭來，瞧着鶴見，「一而要防護你大哥的安全，一面相反地，卻是監視的工作。監視，我想當然不着；我也沒有這個本領。同時，像大哥這樣智勇雙全，哪裏用得着我來防護？也就是爲了今日的東京，完全變了；情形複雜得千頭萬緒。所興的秘密團體，就可編成一本統計表，各有不同的目標，也有黃同的趨向的，有的，一個人跨着團體，取巧投機；像大哥道樣的人，這樣的行動，就是他們做文章的一個好大題目……」　　萍子說着，一壁用了很巧妙的手法，陳卓上的飯食目錄紙卡牛起來，自己看了一看，不知怎麼一來，紙卡上面已經多了一張比那紙卡還小的紙，順手放在鶴見面前，伸着春蔥般的幾隻王指，在上面指指點點，好喋是在跟鶴　　參詳，要點什麼飯食似的。</p>

<p>自由談鬥毆  少夫　　　　當局最近數月來對於整頓交通的努力，全市市民，有目共睹，大家都確乎衷誠敬佩；不過有若干現實上的困難，此如街道狹隘，路面欠修，車輛過多，以及交通警察人員的不敷支配……等等，以致成效雖有，嚴格說來還是有限度的。　　這些困難，分析起來，不外由於錢，人，和時間，我們又知道市政當局有決心，肯幹，且還有不少專家在轉佐，不久的將來，相信可以逐一克服而得到解決的。　　然而人爲的妨害，爲什麽層出不窮呢？如果容許我們說一句刻薄話，那簡直在諷刺當局的努力，或是說那是在開玩笑。　　這些妨害交通的例子太多了，像前天晚上三路公共汽車的司機和交通警的鬥毆，同是隸屬於市政府的機關，同是維持交通的工作人員，竟發生這樣一幕斷絕交通達兩小時之久的事情，我以爲這太蔑視上海全市市民了，市政當局對這件案子該負責任，因爲此風一長，我們小民的行止將隨時仰承他人色笑，這還成什麼樣的一個都市？　　交通公司有交通公司的說法，警察局有警察局的說法，總而言之，都是不識大體。　　賢勞的市長，連日深入民間，訪求民隱，昨天還特地冒風雨去江灣，能不能對這件案子給它一個公正的處分哩！二次大戰秘聞原子炸彈險被納粹利用　１  藍寗譯自十一月份「讀者文摘」　　　　（編者按：關於原子彈險被納粹利用的故事，讀者們也許早有所聞，但大都語焉未詳；這裏自本月份「讀者文摘」中譯載的破壞納粹製造原子彈的紀實，原文載美國「明內彼立斯」論壇報，作者爲F·桑登。這是一篇比較詳細完盡的報吿。）　　一九四四年二月的一個早晨，載荷沉重的鐵路渡輪「水力」號，在挪威汀絲裘湖中破浪前進。突然——從底艙爆發了鬱雷似的轟然巨響。那船猝然傾側，震顫着停了。五分鐘後「水力」號沉沒湖底，隨着帶去了希特勒夢想完成第一顆原子彈。原來這爆炸案後面，還隱藏着此次大戰中足以影響整個人類存亡命運的最驚駭緊張的故事。　　情報　　遠在一九四〇年四月間，國際科學家團體已知道德國凱撒惠姆研類院在進行大規模的原子分裂試騐。一九四二年美國曼哈坦計劃（註）建立後，英國商業戰爭部得到個驚人情報：德人命令挪威電化學工廠諾斯克哈德羅（這是全世界最大的一個），增加重水生產，從三千磅增至一萬磅一年。這祇有一個意義。盟國物理學家發現重水是製造鉀二三五時用的一個理想的「中和物」。因爲盟國並無足够的重水，提煉又需時一年有半，最後已用了黑錯作爲代替。但是英國的情報證實了德國凱撒硏究院的試騐遠超過盟國。破壞諾斯克哈德羅與毀滅那裏的重水存貨，立時成了英國戰時內閣最先處理的問題。空軍參謀部說，若想用當時所有的飛機，對崇山環抱着這個針頭樣大小目的物加以轟炸，是不實際的。這是個突盤隊的任務。　　比此稍早一些時候，有幾個挪威反抗份子曾奪取了一艘海岸汽船珈爾桑號，駛過了水雷與潛艇密佈的北海，逃到了英國亞般汀。其中一人是個曾在挪威組織起地下活動團體的水電學專家，名字呌愛諾。　　他立刻便被倫敦特種部隊總部召見。這位體魄强健的機警的工程師精擅滑雪射擊——對當前任務極爲適宜。他極其鎭靜，富於決斷力。更好的是，他曾在諾斯克哈德羅工廠附近數哩內長住過。他的兄弟與朋輩在那裏頗有地位。　　在特種部隊總部裏，愛諾會見了曾任諾斯克哈德羅重水工廠設計工程師的特朗斯達博士。發展大規模重水製造的人便是這位博士。他在戰前，與極多的德國核子物理學家相友善，因此是當時存在的非德人中最熟知聽國「原子彈」計劃的一個。一九四一年末，特朗斯達逃到瑞典，飛往倫敦。　　破壞　　愛諾問特朗斯達：「照你看來，諾斯克哈德羅是否可以破壞到不能繼續生產嗎？」根據博士的解釋，那工廠是座七層樓，構造堅固的永泥鋼骨建築物。它與鄰近若十同樣牢固的水電力工廠，高據於千呎深谷的危崖上。所有通路以及工廠四圍，都有着精選的德軍守衛。環圍着的峻險的山嶺幾乎是無法通過的。這的確是樁艱難的工作。「但是，我們當然願意試一試。」他說。　　愛諾當即被送到特種部隊訓練營。他很快地學會了使用短波收發機，密碼，跳傘等種種，於是接到了最後的指令。他奉令立即回到挪威，蒐集每一片段有關諾斯克哈德羅的情報，傳遞到倫敦，靜待後援部隊的到來。　　在一個月夜，愛諾從一架英國轟炸機中跳出向離家二十哩的挪威山間直垂下去。日出之前他已滑　安抵家中，與他母親共進早餐了，「我在滑雪旅行，」他吿訴家人說。最初幾日他頗担心，然而顯明地決有一人知道他　珈爾桑事件是有關的。（未完）　　（註：曼哈坦計劃，即是美國龐大的原子彈製造計劃的別稱。）神乎其技  蔡麟　　馬歇爾在南京火車站上曾經領敎過中國「羅賓漢」之略試小技，而發生過一次「盜馬」案，馬對此　表示驚異。　　從前蘇州一個偵緝隊長，問一個三隻手：「你能不能把我袋裏的錶扒去？」那扒手說，「怎駛不能够，只要你明天早上九點光景，經過一次山塘街（早上有菜市很熱鬧）。」隊長將這扒手放走，第二日早晨經過一次山塘街，那制服袋裏的錶，眞的在不知不覺時便不翼而飛了……」　　「死人要看牢三塊棺材板，」這是沒有碰到過扒手者的冷言冷語。　　最近警局正努力肅淸扒手，但是前天我就發生了這麽一回事；我買了兩張火車票，還多三萬元，爲小心起見，三萬元鈔票三疊，用一根橡皮筋套着，兩張火車票塞在橡皮筋的鈔票上，然後藏在胸前的大衣袋裏，將袋上的鈕子扣好。　　三路公共汽車上的乘客，擠得幾乎把車廂快要裂開了，我擠在車上不到二十分鐘。等到下車後，發現大衣裏面的袋上的鈕扣已解開，伸手一摸，我急出一身大汗，鈔票失踪倒是小事，兩張火車票，是舖位車票，遺失了是無法補購，非同小可。　　經我在袋裏一換，摸出一根橡皮筋和兩張火車票來，鈔票沒有了。　　這樣的義賊，我除感謝之外，並相信　之神通廣大，　棺材裏伸出之手，有　　之別。變　吉普變老虎　黃金變糞土  曉南　　變的種類很多：逾淮爲枳是變形；貌是神非是變質；至於魔術家的「各有巧妙不同」，那又是變戲　了。　　無論什麽事情，在中國，都可以變得面目全非：本來是正當交際的跳舞，一變而爲有傷風化的荒淫玩意；「萬能博士」的吉普車，一變而爲横衝直撿的闖禍者；便利輸送的空運，可以變爲走私的最妙工具；甚至接收變爲「刦收」；金磚變爲「銅塊」；黄金變「糞土」；漢奸變「法官」；完全的機器變廢鐵；種種變態，可嘆觀止！　　「窮則變，變則通」。中國是窮的國家，所以有多變的現象，凡變，那一種不是爲着財來！而財力所至，也就無所不通。　　「君子豹變，其文蔚也」。以君子之「人」，變而爲野　之「豹」，在外表看來，還是「其文蔚也」，並不覺得擰猛可怕，這是「變」之最善者。只有在我們這「文物之邦」，才能找得出來。　　多變的中國，究竟還有多少花樣好變呢？又將變到怎樣地步呢？褒貶參半  光椿　　某晚報載：美國外剩餘物資淸委會滬分會前任主管人喬生准將，在職時貪汚案件，層出不窮。自解職後，聞××院物資供應局因爲與喬生在工作上時有接觸，會設怯予以「嘉獎」，已呈請行政院轉國民政府詔頒給中華民國某種勳章。此事係由某美國商人語記者，言畢稱：「不知貴國所贈與外人之勳章，是否分褒貶兩種。」　　筆者願意說明者，中國勳章之分褒貶二種，並非限於贈與外人者。蓋中外一家，天下爲公，並不對外國人特示『優待』也。惟據專家意見：中國之勳章褒貶各居百分之五十，此其所以表現『中庸』之道者也。「不延醫，不服藥！」  沁之　　有的人，神經過敏，一點點小病，鬧得天翻地覆。其實這種過敏，無補健康！　　吳稚暉先生年齡雖高，但身體康健，生病的時候很少，如果偶有小病，他抱着「不延醫不服藥」的信條，靠自己從飲食起居上作自然的療治，凡是親友們所介紹的中西名醫一槪謝絕。　　因肺病逝世的魯迅，在他逝世的前一年，一個外國醫生檢騐他的肺，說他的肺病如果是給歐洲人患了，幾年前就死了。還有比魯迅抵抗病症更頑强更有效果的陳果夫先生，他患第三期肺病有二十年，吐過無數次血，又生過無數次兇猛的大病，演講時面前放一個紙痰盒，邊講邊吐痰，講完時已吐滿了幾個痰盒，但是他應付病非常沉着樂觀，一面病，一面一直在政府中担任重要繁忙的職務，病魔也奈何他不得。黑票  痴墨　　現在的買火車票又很難軋了，無論快車票與慢車票，皆不易購得。　　陳伯莊說得倒漂亮，叫旅客合作，不要買黑市票。須知，誰願意多化錢買黑市票，但，白市票軋不到手，那不得不求之黑市了。再說，那賣黑市票的手中這一疊車票，到底何處購來？這只好心照不宣了。　　問訊處也可以憑柬購票，不過須有「交情」或是「牌頭」。　　單帮又復活了。這些跑單帮的，大都是女性，而且派頭很大，手面很闊，站裏人頭熟，兜得轉，而所帶貨物倒不是「一眼眼」。她自己不用動手，由「紅帽子」搬進軍站，大捆的布，毛中，捲姻，糖，一件件只消攪落一些「長錠」鈿，她們便可以賺幾口「棺材」鈿了。雖然行李費一再增加，她們（跑單帮）却滿不在乎。　　車廂裏的行李架上，座位下，以及走路口，全塞滿了貨物，如果有人說一句公理的話，那末，她們人多，雙拳難敵四手，好男勿同女鬬。　　想不到靑天白日之下的兩路交通，又給跑單帮者所控制。上海橫斷面叫華子的組織　１  黄嘉謨　　　　本地丏幫　　上海是一個繁盛面富足的大城市，它的力量足可養活大量的審生階級而有餘。因此號稱北派的「硬採」丐帮，發跡於黄河南北的「點槍碼子」丐帮，與及流落江漢區域的「風月」丐帮，他們早就看中上海是一處金城玉關，輕易不麒放棄這個好去處。可是「老弟兄」丐帮却也不甘放鬆自己的地盤。因爲「老弟兄」都是蘇滬一帶的江南士著，雖說該帮的歷史短暫，比不及上述一丐帮的帮系悠久，世代「缽」香。但以後起者的姿態出現，同帮弟兄又都是本地人，自不肯讓外地的貧氓喧賓奪主，三分了上海這個肥缺。「老弟兄」丐帮因得地利之先，其爲生活而努力的精神，殊非外帮乞丐所可比擬。而其乞討的方式，居然也都能獨出心裁，決不願抄襲外帮乞丐的老套。因此在前淸末葉，外帮丐頭的勢力正浩大時，老弟兄帮因爲別覓蹊徑，不與外帮丐流爭飯喫，所以不曾與外帮發生過什麽衝突。大家相安無事，各討各的飯。因此而根基得以培餐鞏固，而完成今日的光大。門丐這都是「老弟兄」丐帮處卅術的聰明處。　　原是靑紅幫　　老弟兄雖是一帮無賴漢的集團組織，表面上蓬顯垢面，衣不蔽體，可是提起了此馬來顯大，它的發跡年代，正在淸末靑紅帮勢力開始沒落的季侯。靑紅帮　當年　　做過世面，江湖中蘊　過不少龍虎好漢。到了由盛而衰時，那些能力　　的帮末流氓，旣不敢鋌而走險　因　困而流落爲無賴漢。由時勢所迫而集結同類，狼狽爲奸。他們仗着上海的商業富裕，地面遼闊。認爲大可發展，於是招兵買馬，分頭活動。帮中勢力日趨雄厚。又因帮中人頭腦斬新，最善適應上海社會的需要，換句話說，便是所謂一跟得上時代」。　不是任何「故步自封」的老式丐帮所能企及的。他們的生存方式不全在乞討呌化，而在無孔不入的鑽門路。「扒錢」的新花樣層出不窮，到了今日，居然進可以攻，退可以守。三百餘萬的上海市民，簡直不放在他們眼裏。現在外帮丐流已形成岌岌可危的狀態，在上海的活動勢力已大爲减退。可是老弟兄帮却永遠膠着於上海市面，形成爲一種根深蒂固的優越勢力了。（未完）補白  裕瑗　　淸査團的消息差不多完了。我有兩段歪詩，算是送給她的。　　「淸査團到熱烘烘，聲明任務不放鬆，老虎蒼蠅都不怕，求得石出才算終。　　密吿檢舉數百封，幾乎封封不了終，老虎蒼蠅沒捉到，捉住一撮是淸風。」低調命運使然  淸客　　市府將取締星卜相士迷信職業，本市「命理哲學研究會」於是上了一通「陳情表」，要求當局實施考試甄別，決定取捨。考試制度如果用於算命先生，那倒是一件民國以來的創舉：我很担心將來許多已決定被淘汰命運的妓女，黄包車夫，攤販，水老鼠等等也援例要求考試甄別，那麼市府將增設「考試局」，增設各種專門設備，延聘各業祖師主試這筆費用倒是很可觀的。姑作如是觀  江流　　舞塲營業也鬧不景氣，紐約夜總會又以宣吿淸理聞。很多人遂爲上海經濟恐慌杞憂不止，我則爲市政澄淸有日而額手稱慶。何以故？蓋舞女失業必做妓女，妓女又要受淘汰，從此女人都要逼得仍舊「回到廚房去；」男人也可從政的從政，營商的營商，各自安分守己。大概舞弊，食汚，捲逃，揩油的事件必能從此絕跡了。三毛  張樂平</p>

<h3>Submission of Draft Constitution to the National Assembly; Chairman Explains Drafting Process; General Assembly Begins Formal Discussion Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The third National Assembly convened at 9:25 AM on the 28th. Secretary-General Hong first reported that the National Government had announced a list of 1,744 delegates, of which 1,624 had registered by this morning. A total of 1,369 delegates were present today, exceeding the legal quorum, and the session was declared open. The presidium consisted of Tseng Chi, Pai Chung-hsi, Chen Kuo-fu, Chu Ching-nung, Hu Shih-hua, Ho Cheng-chun, Liang Han-tsao, Huang Yun-su, Tuan Hsi-peng, Hsu Fu-lin, and others, taking turns as chairman. Hu Shih served as the chairman of the General Assembly. The secretariat first reported on the minutes of the second General Assembly and the receipt of congratulatory telegrams and requests for leave from delegates. The chairman then announced that the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China would be submitted to the assembly by Chiang Chung-cheng, Chairman of the National Government. Secretary-General Hong was dispatched to invite Chairman Chiang. After a short while, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Hong, walked to the rostrum. Chairman Chiang, in military attire and wearing medals, held a copy of the constitution draft with a large red silk cover. He approached the rostrum, exchanged salutations with the chairman of the General Assembly, and then presented the draft constitution to the chairman of the assembly with both hands. Hu Shih accepted it on behalf of all the delegates. At that moment, the lights flashed, and applause resounded. A new chapter in the history of the Republic of China began at this time, which was 9:40 AM. Chairman Chiang then stepped to the podium to explain the drafting process of the constitution draft, the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. His remarks were concise and to the point. His emphasis on returning power to the people moved the audience. The speech lasted for 30 minutes, during which the delegates applauded more than ten times, displaying great enthusiasm. After the chairman finished speaking, he left the venue. The chairman of the General Assembly then handed the constitution draft to Secretary-General Hong to read aloud, which was completed at 10:52 AM. At that time, the General Assembly announced a recess until 11:15 AM, when the session resumed. Sun Ke spoke about the drafting and revision process of the constitution draft, concluding at 12:15 PM. During the session, Yu Chia-chu, a representative of the Youth Party, submitted a written opinion, expressing his determination to discuss this constitution draft with an open mind. When the Secretary-General read the opinion, the audience applauded again, adding to the vibrancy of the assembly. Finally, Secretary-General Hong reported that a meeting of the presidium would be held in the afternoon, and the fourth General Assembly would continue tomorrow morning. All provisional motions and requests to speak would be handled in the next General Assembly. The General Assembly adjourned at 12:20 PM.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Reports on Revisions to the Draft Constitution, Article by Article</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Sun Ke's report to the General Assembly on the constitution draft was based on the articles of the May 5th Constitution Draft and its amendments, which he explained one by one:</p>
<p>Article 1 of Chapter 2, General Principles, originally read "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." After considering the opinions of all parties, it has been amended to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, for the people, by the people, and of the people."</p>
<p>Chapter 2, Rights and Obligations of the People, Articles 6 to 25, with Article 24 also being modified, stipulates that the people's freedoms and rights may be restricted by law if necessary to avoid infringing upon the freedom of others, avoid imminent danger, maintain social order, or promote public interest. This is to ensure the freedom of the majority.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, the National Assembly, expands its organization compared to the May 5th Constitution Draft by including members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan as ex officio representatives to the National Assembly. They serve as representatives during the session and remain members of their respective Yuans during the recess, thereby facilitating communication between the government and local representatives. In the original draft, the National Assembly had the power to impeach the President, Vice President, and the heads and deputy heads of each Yuan. This has been amended to only include the power to impeach the President and Vice President.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, the President, also has slight differences. For example, the President must submit any emergency decree issued to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within one month after its issuance. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree, the decree will become invalid, which is a major difference from the original draft. Secondly, the President may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuans to resolve disputes between the Yuans.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 has many more revisions compared to the original draft. For example, the President appoints the President of the Executive Yuan with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. Article 58: The Executive Yuan is only limitedly responsible to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan may pass a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan, and members of the Legislative Yuan may not concurrently hold administrative positions. Therefore, it is not a responsible cabinet system. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request a reconsideration of a law passed by the Legislative Yuan, which is an advantage of the presidential system.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Legislation, has slight revisions. Chapter 7, Judiciary, establishes the Judicial Yuan as the highest judicial organ, adopting a committee system with grand justices. Members of the committee and grand justices may not be affiliated with any party.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Examination, also adopts a committee system. Chapter 9, Control, grants the Control Yuan the power of consent, requiring the President to obtain the consent of the Control Yuan when appointing members of the Judicial and Examination Yuans.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 adds the powers and limits of the central and local governments, adopting a system of balanced power and enumeration. Chapter 11, the provincial and county system, is more detailed than the original draft. Chapter 13 is a combination of the original draft's chapters on national economy and education, and now also includes national defense and military affairs.</p>

<h3>Protecting Political Power and Developing Civil Rights; Hoping to Establish National Law; Chairman Chiang's Speech at the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The original text of Chairman Chiang's speech after presenting the Draft Constitution at the third session of the National Assembly on the morning of the 28th is as follows:</p>
<p>Delegates of the National Assembly:</p>
<p>Today, the National Government submits the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China to the National Assembly for deliberation. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report to the Assembly on the process by which the National Government formulated the Draft Constitution, as well as my views on constitutionalism, for your reference.</p>
<p>The National Government's efforts to formulate the Draft Constitution began in 1933, when the Kuomintang of China resolved to task the Legislative Yuan of the National Government with establishing a Constitution Drafting Committee to draft the constitution. By 1936, the draft constitution was completed, and the National Government officially promulgated it on May 5 of that year. This is what is later known as the May 5th Constitution Draft, which is the first stage of the National Government's formulation of the Draft Constitution.</p>
<p>At that time, the National Government originally planned to convene the National Assembly in November 1937 to enact the constitution. Unfortunately, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out on July 7, 1937, and the convocation of the National Assembly had to be postponed. The creation of the Draft Constitution then entered its second stage.</p>
<p>This stage lasted from the beginning of the War of Resistance in 1937 to the victory of the War of Resistance in 1945. During these eight years, the government continuously promoted discussions on the constitutional military proposal and solicited opinions from all parties in order to improve it. Initially, in 1939, the National Political Council organized the Constitutional Government Promotion Committee to further study and revise the May 5th Constitution Draft. In 1943, the National Political Council established the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, extensively soliciting opinions from the people of the entire country on the Draft Constitution in order to gather wisdom and formulate a perfect constitution. This is the second stage in the creation of the constitution.</p>
<p>The time from the victory of the War of Resistance to today is the third stage in the creation of the Draft Constitution.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the government opened the Political Consultative Conference, deciding to revise the May 5th Constitution Draft and to submit the amendment proposed by the Constitutional Government Promotion Committee and the results of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association's study of the Draft Constitution to the Draft Review Committee for summarization and research. Based on the principles of revision decided by the Political Consultative Conference, the articles were compiled, organized, and drafted for amendment. However, after late April, the work was temporarily suspended because the Chinese Communist Party advocated retaining the revision work. It was not until November 18 and 19 that the government held two consultations with the Chinese Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social figures, further reviewing, organizing, and supplementing the complete draft based on the principles of revision of the Political Consultative Conference. The Legislative Yuan completed the legislative process on the 21st. This is the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China that the National Government is submitting to the National Assembly today. Although the Chinese Communist Party did not participate in the completion of this Draft Constitution, most of the parties that participated in the Political Consultative Conference at that time agreed to it. The Draft Constitution of the Republic of China took a total of fourteen years to establish, undergoing multiple revisions. Today, the National Government is submitting it to the National Assembly for deliberation. After submitting this draft today on behalf of the government, I recall that our founding father led the revolution for more than fifty years, and after eight years of long-term resistance, our revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilians shed their blood and fought sacrificially, never giving up. Only then were we able to have today's National Assembly to discuss this constitution draft. It can be said that this constitution draft was forged with the blood and tears of the military, civilians, and revolutionary martyrs of the entire country over the past fifty years. Today, on the one hand, I remember how difficult it was to complete this constitution draft. At the same time, I think that after the constitution is enacted in the future, it will be of great importance to the country's governance and the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, I cannot help but express my sincere views on the constitution and my expectations for the assembly for your consideration.</p>
<p>Accepting the People's Trust and Formulating a Perfect Constitution</p>
<p>Today, after the National Government submits the Draft Constitution to the National Assembly, it can be said that the government has handed over the responsibility of the country to the people of the entire country. From today onwards, the people of the entire country will begin to shoulder this important responsibility. (Applause) All delegates, entrusted by the people of the entire country, must examine the situation, fulfill their responsibilities, and formulate a perfect and feasible constitution in order to live up to the expectations of the people of the entire country. (Applause) Delegates, your responsibility lies in making the constitution. The constitution we formulate should not only be formally perfect, but also be able to be implemented without hindrance. Since the government announced the May 5th Constitution Draft, it has been studied by the people of the entire country for ten years and has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The May 5th Constitution Draft was formulated based on the Five-Power Constitution of the founding father. Everyone knows that the Five-Power Constitution invented by the founding father is the newest and most advanced constitution in the world. However, why did the government revise the May 5th Constitution Draft? Why does the constitution draft submitted by the government today not fully conform to the founding father's Five-Power Constitution? I must explain this point today.</p>
<p>After inventing the Five-Power Constitution, the founding father often told us: "Having a good constitution is not enough; there must also be people who faithfully implement the constitution. It is best to have the people who created the constitution implement it, so that the essence of the constitution can be promoted. Otherwise, if the people who implement the constitution do not understand the spirit of constitutionalism, then the implementation of the constitution will not be sure and smooth." I would like to draw your attention to this passage today. The essence of the founding father's Five-Power Constitution lies in the separation of powers and functions, and the separation of political power and governing power. To maximize the essence of this constitution, two conditions must be met:</p>
<p>First, the people who exercise political power must have the ability and habit to control political power and ensure political power.</p>
<p>Second, the government that exercises governing power must be able to abide by the limits of governing power and not infringe on political power with governing power. If the people who exercise governing power do not respect political power and infringe on political power, and at the same time, the people who exercise political power do not have the ability and habit to control political power, then the result will completely violate the spirit of the founding father's creation. Therefore, the Five-Power Constitution is best exercised by the founding father himself, using governing power to protect political power, nurture political power, and cultivate the people's ability and habit to exercise political power, so that political power and governing power complement each other, and the government does not become incompetent and the people do not become powerless, so that the ideal can be achieved. If the people who implement the constitution cannot take the spirit of the founding father as their spirit and cannot fulfill the responsibility of protecting and supporting political power, then abuses will inevitably occur in the future.</p>
<p>Because the central system of the Five-Power Constitution can be said to be a presidential system, if the people who exercise political power do not have the ability to control political power and cannot have appropriate control over governing power, then the president's power will be excessively concentrated, which will inevitably lead to totalitarian politics. This kind of politics is not in line with the current era and is harmful to China and the Chinese nation. (Loud applause)</p>
<p>The Constitution is Enacted for a Specific Period; It Must Benefit the People</p>
<p>Fellow delegates, believing in the founding father's teachings and adhering to the Five-Power Constitution, we must not allow the founding father's Five-Power Constitution to become totalitarian politics and harm the country and the nation. Therefore, I would like to ask everyone today to estimate the ability and habits of our compatriots to exercise political power, and to examine the international environment and the trend of the times. If we implement the Five-Power Constitution today, will the people be able to control political power and not be infringed upon by governing power? I can say that most of the people in our country do not have this ability and habit at present. If we implement the Five-Power Constitution without any guarantee, I personally think it is very dangerous. Of course, with so much talent in our country and the founding father's teachings being so moving, there are many people who have the ability to exercise governing power and understand the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. However, delegates, you must know that when the people cannot control political power and consolidate political power themselves, it is ultimately a risky attempt to completely rely on the people who exercise governing power to respect political power.</p>
<p>I believe that if I were to exercise the Five-Power Constitution myself, I would be able to take the heart of the founding father as my heart, use governing power to protect political power, nurture political power, and fully develop civil rights. (Loud applause) However, I myself have been fighting for the country and shouldering heavy responsibilities for twenty years since the founding father's death in 1925. Only because the foundation of the country has not been consolidated, constitutional government has not been implemented, and the revolutionary duty cannot be abandoned, I cannot refuse the affairs of the country. Now that the National Assembly has convened, the constitution is enacted for a specific period, and the work of revolutionary nation-building can be said to have come to an end. I personally have no political desires or interests, and I am already sixty years old this year, and I can no longer shoulder heavy responsibilities like I have in the past twenty years. Therefore, I must entrust the responsibility of the country to my compatriots across the country. Because of this, I am particularly concerned about the establishment of the national law, so that its implementation is beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people. (Loud applause)</p>
<p>Hoping for Deep Consideration; Laying a Good Foundation for Constitutional Government</p>
<p>Today, I represent the National Government in submitting the constitution draft to the Assembly. Of course, I respect the opinions of the Assembly. At the same time, from the standpoint of a representative of the people, for the sake of protecting political power and developing civil rights, I am in favor of and support the constitution draft submitted by the National Government today. I believe that the May 5th Constitution Draft is not suitable for today. Today, I contribute my experience of the constitution over the past fourteen years to the delegates, hoping that you will consider the country and the nation deeply and lay a good foundation for the implementation of constitutional government. It must be known that the survival and decline of the country and the prosperity and honor of the nation in the future are all related to whether the implementation of constitutional government is smooth. The responsibility of making the constitution lies with the delegates.</p>
<p>Today, when we make the constitution, we must be fair and sincere, purely for the sake of the country's peace and the people's welfare. We must not be rigid and inflexible, nor should we cut our feet to fit the shoes, ignoring the needs of the people and ignoring the factors of the times. We must gather wisdom, be prudent and comprehensive, and formulate a perfect and feasible constitution so that the people of the entire country can be practiced, so that our founding father and the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs and the war martyrs who died in battle for the past fifty years can be comforted in the ground.</p>
<p>In short, the constitution we want to formulate must be practical and feasible, so that the country can be stable and lasting, and the construction work can be advanced. Only then can people's livelihood be happy, and civil rights will naturally develop and consolidate day by day. By that time, I believe that our founding father's Five-Power Constitution will surely be fully realized. Finally, I wish you all to work together to complete our great and sacred task of making the constitution. (Warm applause) (End)</p>

<h3>Withdrawal of Railway Personnel from Shenyang: Soviet Embassy Issues Statement, Central News Agency Clarifies News Source</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Information Department of the Soviet Embassy in China issued a statement at 11:00 AM on the 28th, the original text of which is as follows: Regarding the Shenyang dispatch of the Central News Agency on November 22nd, the Soviet Embassy in China deems it necessary to make the following statement: The Central News Agency reported that the agency had learned from authoritative sources: "After several consultations between the Chinese government and the Soviet authorities, it was decided to send Soviet railway employees back to their country." The Soviet Embassy in China has indeed repeatedly raised the issue of withdrawing Soviet employees from Shenyang with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the Central News Agency misinterprets the true reason for the Embassy's taking this step. The return of Soviet railway employees to the Soviet Union is not due to their poor health or economic hardship, but rather due to the fact that they have positions but cannot perform their duties. For several months, the Chinese authorities have created a situation that is not only difficult for their work but also for their residence in Shenyang. The Embassy has obtained various information confirming the following facts: the local administrative and military authorities not only fail to provide the Soviet employees with the protection they deserve, but also allow some Soviet employees to become victims of beatings in which Chinese soldiers and police also participate in aiding and abetting, as well as other illegal acts. The private property of most Soviet employees has either been taken away by local officials or looted by Chinese soldiers, making their material environment extremely difficult. At the same time, Chinese personnel of the China Chang Railway Bureau have, in fact, long prevented Soviet employees participating in the Changchun section from actually working in the Shenyang section of the railway. Since the Chinese local authorities have created such a situation in Shenyang, the Soviet employees realize that it is impossible to continue living there. Furthermore, the Central News Agency insists that there are still 200 Soviet employees who will continue to stay in Shenyang, which is also inaccurate. All Soviet employees will return to the Soviet Union within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] According to our agency's Shenyang dispatch on the 22nd, regarding the request of some Soviet employees in Shenyang of the China Chang Railway to withdraw and return to their country, the Soviet side had requested to transfer some Soviet employees in Shenyang who were ill, experiencing difficult living conditions, and had less work back to the Soviet Union. Our side expressed its desire to retain them. After several consultations with the Soviet side, our government finally agreed to the Soviet side's request to temporarily allow these employees to return to their country and provided them with transportation convenience. The remaining employees were transported to Tianjin by the Railway Bureau in preparation to embark to the Soviet Union. The government also provided them with travel expenses for their return. As for the remaining one hundred or more Soviet employees, they are still staying with the Railway to continue their work. The above news was learned by our agency's reporter from the China Chang Railway in Shenyang.</p>
<h3>Soviet Withdrawal of Employees Not a Diplomatic Strategy</h3>
<p>An Individual’s Opinion on Soviet Statement</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Soviet Embassy issued a statement at noon on the 28th regarding the withdrawal of Soviet employees from the China Chang Railway and their return to their country, refuting the Central News Agency's report, which has attracted widespread attention here. This has suddenly brought an issue that has been brewing for more than a month to the surface. The Central News Agency often seeks instructions from the Central Propaganda Department and liaises with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will provide an explanation in this regard. However, the reporter learned that the content of the Central News Agency's Shenyang dispatch is no different from the official report of Zhang Jianfei, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Northeast. The statement that 200 Soviet employees will continue to stay in Shenyang is also consistent with reality. In order to thoroughly understand the truth of this matter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Zhang to conduct a detailed investigation and report, and to contact Zhang Jia'ao and Zhai Shihui for reference. According to a qualified person, the Soviet statement that the private property of most Soviet employees was confiscated or looted may have been due to occasional incidents when the Northeast was newly taken over by the National Army and the order was still chaotic. However, such incidents would never be committed by officers and soldiers of our newly trained National Defense Forces. After the takeover was completed and order was restored, such situations would not occur again. The Soviet statement did not specify the exact time and events. As for the claim that Soviet employees were subjected to beatings in which Chinese soldiers and police also participated in aiding and abetting, we do not know whether any conflicts occurred in the Northeast due to the discord between the White Russians who recently acquired Soviet nationality and the local people. However, we can boldly assume that if Soviet expatriates in the Northeast had indeed suffered such intentional abuse and the Chinese political and military authorities did not provide the protection they deserved, our friendly country, the Soviet Union, would have long been unwilling to remain silent and would not have waited until the Central News Agency reported and refuted it before making a statement. Considering that the direct motive of this statement was purely caused by the Central News Agency's report, we would rather believe that this is merely a question of the accuracy of a news report and do not want to make overly sensitive speculations, believing that the Soviet side's move has a diplomatic strategic nature, causing the currently rumored situation in Dalian and the clouds of doubt spread between China and the Soviet Union to be covered with an uneasy atmosphere, affecting the friendship between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Commander of Soviet Forces in North Korea Visits Zhao Gongwu</h3>

Andong is preparing a grand welcome. A luncheon banquet will be held at the Yalu River Spring.</p>

<h3>Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement: Explaining the Contents of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty, Both Sides Enjoy Equal and Reciprocal Benefits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Wang Huacheng, Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, must issue a responsible statement on the Sino-US Commercial Treaty issue as follows:</p>
<p>After the full text of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty was announced, there have been many comments from all walks of life, but some people seem to not fully understand the contents of the treaty, so misunderstandings are unavoidable. Looking at the criticisms from all walks of life, the most important point is that the strengths of China and the United States are different, and our country cannot enjoy the same equal and reciprocal benefits as the United States based on the treaty. On this point, we have paid close attention to it at all times during the negotiations.</p>
<p>In the entire negotiating process, our government has always adhered to the following three points as its guiding principles:</p>
<p>First, the conclusion of the new Sino-US Commercial Treaty is necessary for us. This point is very easy to understand, because although consular jurisdiction, concessions, etc. have been abolished in the recent Sino-US new treaty, unequal commercial treaties between China and the United States still exist. Most of these treaties only stipulate the treatment that foreigners should enjoy in China, and do not stipulate the treatment that Chinese overseas Chinese should enjoy in those countries. Before the new commercial treaty is concluded, the old commercial treaties are still valid, so the conclusion of an equal new commercial treaty is actually necessary for us.</p>
<p>Second, for matters such as business, residence, and travel, I must provide reasonable guarantees to the citizens of countries that do not discriminate against Chinese people. If I do not provide such guarantees, the relationship between China and other countries will inevitably be in a state of friction and disharmony. If our country wants to encourage the introduction of foreign capital and foreign technology, it is especially inappropriate to allow this state to exist or develop.</p>
<p>Third, the security guarantees that the Chinese government and people need in the economic and cultural fields must be set in all necessary reservation clauses in the treaty; because our country is an industrially backward and scientifically backward country, if there are no such clauses, our citizens will continue to receive equal and reciprocal benefits abroad, but will inevitably be harmed at home. I will now describe in detail the reservation clauses set by our government in the new Sino-US treaty for the study of those who are interested in this treaty. My explanation is by no means intended to boast of the success of the negotiations. In this negotiation process, both China and the United States did not have the slightest intention of seeking unilateral victory. This is a major feature of this negotiation, and I dare to responsibly tell the people of China and the United States. The United States gave sincere consideration to China's difficulties whenever we pointed them out, and our country took the same attitude toward the United States' difficulties. The following reservation clauses were established because of this harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>(1) Reservations on the employment of citizens of both parties in each other's territories—Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the treaty stipulates that citizens of one contracting party can only engage in various occupations that are not exclusively reserved for citizens of the other contracting party. Therefore, if one contracting party believes that a certain occupation should be reserved for its own citizens, it can legislate it at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Reservations on the engagement of citizens, legal persons, and organizations of both parties in various undertakings—Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that citizens of one contracting party may engage in commerce, manufacturing, processing, science, education, religion, and charitable undertakings in the other party in accordance with the laws of the other party that are not prohibited, and shall also receive national treatment. However, this right can only be enjoyed in individual capacity and cannot organize legal persons and organizations to enjoy the above-mentioned national treatment. As for foreign legal persons and organizations, although they generally enjoy national treatment in accordance with Article 3 of the treaty, this does not apply when the law provides otherwise. Therefore, either contracting party may still give its own legal persons and organizations certain necessary special treatment, which is completely consistent with the provisions of Article 297 of our new Company Law.</p>
<p>(3) Reservations on the mining rights of both parties in each other's territories—Article 5 of the treaty stipulates that if one contracting party grants the rights to explore and develop mineral resources in its territory to citizens, legal persons, or organizations of any third country, then this right shall also be granted to citizens, legal persons, or organizations of the other contracting party in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. This provision is entirely a hypothesis. Either contracting party reserves the right not to grant any mining rights to foreigners, so the other party does not need to enjoy this right. In addition, the words "in the future" are included in the text of the treaty, specifically indicating that even if either contracting party has granted this right to a third country before the treaty comes into effect, the other contracting party cannot invoke this as an example.</p>
<p>(4) Reservations on the acquisition and disposal of real estate by both parties—Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the treaty stipulates that the people of the two countries shall enjoy the right to acquire and dispose of real estate within each other's territory in accordance with the procedures and conditions prescribed by local laws and regulations, and shall enjoy the same treatment as the nationals of third countries. This provision is entirely based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, and reserves full freedom for the local country's legislation on land administration.</p>
<p>(5) Reservations on copyright—Article 9 stipulates that the inventions, trademarks, and copyrights of citizens, legal persons, and organizations of one contracting party shall be effectively protected in the other party's territory and shall not be imitated, used, or translated. All countries regard copyright as being as important as other property rights. Since other property rights cannot be violated at will, neither can copyright. The reprinting of copyrighted works is universally prohibited by all walks of life in the world, with few exceptions. Our country's "Copyright Law" also expressly prohibits it. In this regard, the copyrighted works of Chinese and foreign people should enjoy the same treatment. As for American newspapers, magazines, and books occasionally cited by Chinese writers or newspapers, this will not cause the difficulties that the general public worries about, because according to the provisions of the treaty, copyright protection is limited to works that have been legally registered with our official authorities. Those who have not registered in accordance with this procedure are not within the protection of this treaty. Moreover, according to our country's "Copyright Law," occasional excerpts and citations of other people's works for reference and annotation in one's own works are not considered infringement of other people's copyrights. But the most important thing is our reservation on translation rights. Our side made it clear to the US side during the negotiations that due to the differences between the Chinese and American languages, the Chinese translation of American works will not only not hinder the sales of the original works in China, but will sometimes be sufficient to make readers purchase the original works for reference. In order to communicate the culture of the two countries, it is necessary to encourage Chinese translation. The US side expressed sympathy for our view, and agreed to delete the words prohibiting translation in the original draft, and in response to our request, specifically stated in the protocol that if the laws of the method do not give the country's citizens, legal persons, and organizations protection that prohibits translation, then there is no need to give this protection to the other party's citizens, legal persons, and organizations. Since our current "Copyright Law" does not prohibit translation, our people can still translate any copyrighted work published in the United States, without any restrictions from the author.</p>
<p>(6) On the right of citizens of both parties to establish schools - Our country has always attached great importance to the education of overseas Chinese. In the treaties that I have signed with various countries in the past, the right of overseas Chinese to establish schools has often been included in the text of the treaty in order to obtain treaty protection. Article 12 of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty also specifically stipulates that the citizens of both parties may establish schools in each other's territories to educate their children. The only restriction is that this educational undertaking must not be contrary to public morality and must be handled in accordance with relevant local laws and regulations. This is actually necessary for both parties to control foreign schools.</p>
<p>(7) On the treatment of import and export tariffs and sales of goods of both parties - Regarding the import and export tariffs of goods of both parties, Article 16 stipulates that they should enjoy the same treatment as third countries. This is not only in line with our country's current tariff collection methods, but also a common practice in all countries in the world. It has no impact on the principle of tariff autonomy of the contracting parties, because there are no restrictions on matters such as tariff rates and the prohibition and restriction of import and export of goods. Both parties reserve the full right to decide. Therefore, the Sino-US Commercial Treaty does not hinder any tariff policies that our country may adopt in the future. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will pay special attention to this point. As for the sales, distribution, use, etc. of goods after they enter the country, they can only enjoy the same treatment as third countries, and do not enjoy national treatment. Therefore, if it is necessary for our country to give preferential treatment to domestic goods in this regard, it will not be subject to any restrictions in the treaty.</p>
<p>(8) On the scope of navigation of ships of both parties - After the Sino-US Commercial Treaty was signed, the shipping industry was deeply worried that American ships would sail to all ports in our country. In fact, this is an over-concern. Article 21, Paragraph 3 of the treaty clearly stipulates that the ships of one contracting party can only load goods to all ports and territorial waters of the other party that are open to foreign commerce and shipping. Therefore, either contracting party may decide which ports are open and which are not. The right is in its own hands. Foreign ships are not allowed to arbitrarily carry goods into ports that are not open. Therefore, the restriction on the scope of navigation is also a reservation made for the benefit of the country.</p>
<p>(9) Reservations on coastal trade and inland waterway navigation rights - Article 24, Paragraph 2, the provisions on the reservation of coastal trade and inland waterway navigation rights are the same as the text of the exchange of notes of the 1934 Sino-US New Treaty. Some commentators believe that since the reservation of this right has been included in the Sino-US New Treaty, there is no need to repeat it in the commercial treaty. What they do not know is that this time what is being concluded is an entire commercial navigation treaty, so it is customary to include all matters related to coastal trade and inland waterway navigation. Moreover, my side has always insisted on the necessary reservation of coastal trade and inland waterway navigation rights to be enjoyed by domestic citizens, so not only are these rights carefully stipulated, but it is also advocated that the treaty should stipulate that trade between any contracting party and its islands or territories should also be regarded as coastal trade. Under this meaning, the trade between the mainland of our country and Taiwan or Hainan Island can be prohibited from being operated by foreigners.</p>
<p>(10) On the unilateral reservation issues of the United States - Article 26, Paragraph 4 stipulates that the provisions of this contract, in the United States and its territories or dependencies, or the mutual granting in the Panama Canal Zone, or the United States and its territories or dependencies, or the preferential treatment given to Cuba or the Philippines in the Panama Canal Zone, do not apply. Commentators believe that this is a unilateral reservation on the part of the United States and is unfavorable to us. In fact, the United States has this provision in the commercial treaties it has signed with other countries. Because the United States and Cuba and the Philippines have special treaty relations, it is impossible for us to obtain more favorable conditions than any other country. However, the fact that our country's treatment must not be inferior to any other country is clearly stipulated in Article 10 of the Protocol. If the United States gives the aforementioned special preferential treatment to any other country, it should also give it to our country in the same way.</p>
<p>(11) About this Treaty replacing Old Treaties - Article 29, Paragraph 1 of the treaty stipulates that once this treaty comes into effect, it should immediately replace the various clauses of the old treaties between China and the United States that have not yet been abolished. All of these old treaties are the unequal commercial treaties between China and the United States in the past. If there is no conclusion of this new commercial treaty, our country will still be bound by it.</p>
<p>(12) On the effective period of this treaty - Due to the ever-changing nature of international commercial relations, the effective period of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty is only stipulated to be five years. One year before the expiration of the five years, either contracting "party may notify the other party to abolish it. Therefore, at that time, I can decide whether it should continue or be revised depending on how the treaty is implemented.</p>
<p>The meaning of the Most Favored Nation Clause - Finally, I would like to explain the meaning of the Most Favored Nation Clause: The so-called most favored nation treatment is actually equal treatment with third countries. This is the principle that our country has been striving for in diplomacy over the years. Since I do not want overseas Chinese in the United States to suffer treatment lower than that received by the citizens of other countries, then I should not treat American expatriates in China unequally. In the past, the most-favored-nation clause did have its drawbacks. The reason for this was the existence of unequal treaties and the provisions of the unilateral most-favored-nation clause, as well as the absence of certain reserved clauses.</p>
<p>Based on the above explanation, I believe that it will not be difficult for readers to give a correct judgment on the Sino-US Commercial Treaty. Other new treaties that replace old commercial treaties are yet to be concluded. Our government will definitely continue to work cautiously in accordance with the above three guiding principles to live up to the expectations of the people.</p>

<h3>Different Criticisms of the New Commercial Treaty: American Businessmen Believe It Is Beneficial to Us, The US Congress Will Discuss It Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Many Chinese critics of the new Sino-US Commercial Treaty say that it is beneficial to the United States and not beneficial to China. This statement is unacceptable to the American business community. Most American businessmen have the opposite view, saying that this treaty is excessively beneficial to China. For example, copyrights and patents have not been given sufficient attention in the commercial treaty, which American businessmen seeking to do business in China believe is extremely important. Generally speaking, Americans who pay attention to trade with China all say that the purpose of the commercial treaty is to give equal rights to the two countries, but under the current situation in China, it is actually only beneficial to China. The new treaty must be ratified by the governments of both countries before it can come into effect. The US Congress will discuss this treaty after it convenes in early January. It will first be jointly reviewed by the House Committee and then submitted to the Senate for approval. It is expected that this treaty will be passed by Congress and will not be subject to severe opposition.</p>
<h3>The Serious Problem of Smuggling in Hong Kong: The Key to the Success or Failure of Our Revised Trade Measures - A Statement by the Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, accompanied by Mr. Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the same bank, and Mr. Qian Zongqi, Tax Commissioner of the General Tax Inspectorate, flew to Guangdong on the 19th of this month. They made brief stays in both Guangzhou and Hong Kong, conducting detailed investigations into the economic and trade situations in both places, and returned to this city at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. When our reporter visited to inquire about the trip, Director Li said: "The key to the success or failure of the government's newly promulgated revised import and export trade measures is closely related to resolving the problem of smuggling in Hong Kong. Otherwise, the stricter the implementation of the revised trade measures, the more rampant smuggling in Hong Kong will become. If the smuggling problem is resolved, the problem of capital flight through overseas remittances can also be resolved."</p>
<p>Overseas Remittances Concentrated in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Mr. Li then pointed out three ways to solve the problem of smuggling in Hong Kong: (1) Strengthen the anti-smuggling efforts of the customs; (2) Local authorities, military and police should cooperate in cracking down on smuggling; (3) Obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government. Mr. Li said that the coastlines of Guangdong and Fujian provinces are quite long, and the anti-smuggling force of the customs is extremely weak and must be strengthened as much as possible. The cooperation of local authorities is also necessary. The Hong Kong government must actively cooperate; otherwise, passive assistance will only encourage smuggling. He believes that the Hong Kong government can sincerely cooperate because, in the long term, Hong Kong's prosperity is closely related to the rise and fall of the mainland economy.</p>
<p>Overseas Remittances Concentrated in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Regarding overseas remittances to our country: Hong Kong has recently become a transfer point for remittances from Southeast Asia and the Americas, from which they are redistributed to various parts of Guangdong and Fujian. If our country can control the amount of overseas remittances, it will also help implement the revised trade measures. Before the war, the total amount of overseas remittances to our country was about US$130 to 140 million per year. Although remittances from Southeast Asia have decreased since the war, remittances from the Americas have increased dramatically, so the total amount has not decreased. However, most of the internal remittances from Hong Kong are handled by banks in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The banks in Guangzhou are divided into three types: silver firms, foreign exchange, and money shops. A total of 86 have joined the association, but only 11 have been issued licenses by the Ministry of Finance, and only 20 to 30 comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. In addition, there are 15 ordinary commercial banks. This time, a meeting was held with the Guangzhou banking industry, instructing them to cooperate more with the country and instructing them on three points: (1) Remittances in national currency via Hong Kong, which could promote capital flight, should first be approved by the Central Bank; (2) The foreign exchange positions purchased by each bank should be sold to the Central Bank. Currently, banks that have not been designated to operate foreign exchange and banks that have not obtained licenses to operate foreign currency transactions are applying to the Central Bank for permits to obtain legal status.</p>
<p>Market Conditions in Guangdong and Hong Kong</p>
<p>Guangzhou's export figures are not large, but in the future, products such as ramie, tung oil, and raw silk produced in Hunan and Jiangxi will be exported from here. The Guangzhou market is currently quite sluggish, with interest rates lower than those in Shanghai, so large amounts of capital have been transferred to Shanghai. Money has always been tight in Guangzhou's market, and the local financial community hopes that the Central Bank can find a way to stop this.</p>
<p>In contrast, Hong Kong's reconstruction work is progressing smoothly, having completed about 70% of the job. The financial situation is stable, and interest rates are surprisingly low, with no interest on current deposits, 2% on fixed deposits, and only 6% on loans. Prices are also stable, and generally expected to fall. With low interest rates and reduced expenses, many industrialists from Shanghai have gone to inspect, and many are preparing to set up factories there. Price controls are strictly enforced in Hong Kong, and there are price limits on clothing, food, housing, and transportation, which are implemented thoroughly. British woollen piece goods are 30% to 50% cheaper than in Shanghai, while American goods are not as popular as in the Shanghai market. There are 25 Chinese banks in Hong Kong, but most of them cannot develop fully. Although the Hong Kong government does not control foreign exchange on the surface, HSBC often manages it, and overseas remittances are often used for large-scale purposes. The official exchange rate in Hong Kong is HK$4 to US$1, but the black market rate is HK$4.60 per US$1.</p>
<p>Gold Prices in Guangdong and Hong Kong</p>
<p>As for gold prices, both Guangdong and Hong Kong are cheaper than Shanghai, with Guangzhou cheaper than Shanghai by 4% and Hong Kong cheaper by 10%. The price of gold in both places is about 270,000 legal tender per tael, but it is measured using the old weight system. Currently, the daily turnover in Guangzhou is about 10,000 taels or more, mostly smuggled from Hong Kong, with about 3,000 taels arriving daily, it is said.</p>
<p>Lin Fengbao's Statement</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Fengbao, he told reporters that the Temporary Import Management Committee, considering the special circumstances of Guangzhou being close to Hong Kong and Macau, and to avoid commercial stagnation due to the promulgation of new regulations, specially sent him and Mr. Qian Zongqi, Tax Commissioner of the General Tax Inspectorate, to Guangdong on the 19th. They repeatedly discussed steps with the local tax commissioners and representatives of designated banks in Guangzhou, and went to Hong Kong to discuss with the tax commissioners of the Yuehai, Kowloon, and Gongbei customs offices. It was decided that a part of the import business there involved purchases from Hong Kong by merchants from Guangzhou, and that not a few were actively shipping goods from Hong Kong to Guangdong for sale. At the same time, tens of thousands of people travel between Hong Kong and Guangdong daily, and there are many small-scale imports. To adapt to the needs of the situation, it was necessary to adopt an expedient measure, and after approval was obtained from the Temporary Import Management Committee, temporary import permits will be issued in Guangzhou and Kowloon by designated banks and customs offices, respectively, based on the type of goods and the quantity limit, until the end of this year. Once the registration of all merchants is completed, they will be transferred to Shanghai for review and issuance. Mr. Lin reported to the committee yesterday evening after his return to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The Capital is All Silver-White: A Siberian Cold Wave Strikes; Snow Falls Everywhere in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 28th] It snowed heavily in Nanjing all day on the 28th, stopping only at night. The weather also turned cold sharply, dropping to 1 degree Celsius at the coldest time. Several refugees in Xiaguan have frozen to death due to the severe cold. Many women, children, and the elderly are on the verge of death, urgently in need of relief. It is reported that it did not snow in Nanjing last winter. This is the first auspicious snow in two years.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] After three days of rain, it began to snow heavily in the capital on the morning of the 28th, becoming heavier at noon. By the evening, the entire city was covered in white. The snow had not stopped by 7:00 PM. This is the first snowfall of the year. It is reported that the cause is a sudden Siberian cold wave that began on the 25th of this month and invaded the country from the northwest from Siberia. On the 27th, it reached the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, causing the temperature in the Nanjing and Shanghai area to drop sharply, falling to around zero degrees this morning. The reason for the snowfall is that the warm air layer over Nanjing collided with the cold air mass, causing the warm air to rise from the low altitude. The moisture in it came into contact with the cold air in the upper layers, quickly condensing into snow and falling (For weather reports on Shanghai, please see page six).</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 28th] The weather turned cold suddenly on the 28th. From morning until the time of this report, it was snowing heavily. There were few pedestrians on the roads of Jinshan, Jiaoshan, and Beigushan, and everyone indoors had started fires for warmth.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 28th] The weather in Wuxi has been warm like autumn since the beginning of winter. Last night, the weather turned cold and it has been raining continuously. At 1:00 PM today, it suddenly began to snow again, and the weather became even colder.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 28th] The weather here changed suddenly today, becoming as cold as mid-winter, with continuous rain all day. It began to snow at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou on the 28th] Winter has arrived, and the first snow fell in Hangzhou today.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hankou on the 28th] It began to snow heavily here at 6:00 AM this morning, and it has not stopped all day. The wind is biting, and the temperature is more than five degrees lower than last winter. The market is even more sluggish, and the security authorities have ordered their subordinates to strengthen winter defenses.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Team Suggests Improving Our Rural Areas; Hesheng Submits the Report to Truman</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Dr. Hesheng, Dean of the College of Agriculture of the University of California, today submitted to President Truman a report on the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group's improvement of Chinese agriculture, strongly advocating that the National Government of China can alleviate domestic unrest through rural reform. Hesheng then gave a speech to hundreds of officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, explaining some of the suggestions he made to the Chinese government. He said that before leaving China, he had sent copies of his report to senior Chinese officials, Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall. Hesheng expressed his opinion that if the Chinese government can catch up and implement a strong agricultural plan, the domestic unrest in China can be greatly alleviated, because most of the unrest in China stems from rural areas. He praised Chinese farmers as "good people," but said that there were many areas that needed improvement. Hesheng put forward four special suggestions as follows: (1) Promote the use of improved seeds; (2) Use more chemical fertilizers to replace the currently used organic fertilizers; (3) Expand the use of methods to control pests and plant diseases; (4) Increase irrigation facilities.</p>

<h3>A Strong Guarantee for Embarking on the Road to Democracy</h3>
<p>—After Reading Chairman Chiang's Speech—</p>
<p>The National Assembly held its third session yesterday. The draft constitution has been solemnly presented by Chairman Chiang himself. As soon as the agenda for discussing the draft constitution is decided, the discussion of the draft constitution will begin. After listening to Chairman Chiang's speech at the National Assembly yesterday, we are even more convinced that the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment will be approved by a majority of the representatives at the National Assembly. There are three key points in Chairman Chiang's speech: (1) The Five-Power Constitution is the newest and most advanced constitution in the world, but the people of our country are not yet able to exercise political power; therefore, the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution is impractical and cannot be applied. (2) The spirit of the Five-Power Constitution lies in the division of "power" and "ability." Those in power must exercise the power of governance from the standpoint of the people and think for those who exercise political power; otherwise, it is easy to become a centralized system. (3) The constitution is valuable in its implementation. Regarding the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment, not only is he in favor of it, but he also sincerely hopes that the National Assembly can approve it. Chairman Chiang, as the Director-General of the Kuomintang, which is in power, has such magnanimity of "regarding the world as his own," which is the most powerful guarantee for China to embark on the road to democracy.</p>
<p>Although a small number of Kuomintang representatives have insisted on the essence of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution and expressed dissenting opinions on the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment, after Chairman Chiang's repeated and sincere explanations, they will be able to abandon their prejudices, take into account reality, and accept this Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which is almost certain. The Youth Party representatives also announced to the National Assembly yesterday that the party's representatives "will do their best to participate in the discussion and promote the formulation of this modern and perfect constitution needed by the people of the whole country." As for the Democratic Socialist Party, it had already made the passage of this draft constitution amendment a condition for participating in the National Assembly and supporting this draft constitution, which goes without saying. This is also not a problem for the social elite. In addition to this, what remains are only the truly democratically elected representatives. Although they regard the Political Consultative Conference as a party conference and are unwilling to be bound by the resolutions, Chairman Chiang also announced when answering questions from representatives: The National Assembly is not bound by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, democratically elected representatives cannot ignore the domestic reality, especially since democratically elected representatives were elected before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and eight or nine years have passed. Whether they can still represent public opinion seems to be a problem. If we weigh the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution and its amendments from the perspective of political science theory, then we must say that the amendments have made considerable progress. Democratically elected representatives have no reason to object.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said: "This draft constitution presented today can be said to have been forged by the blood and tears of the military and civilians and martyrs across the country over the past fifty years. Today, I, on behalf of the government, submit this draft constitution. At the same time, I think that after the constitution is formulated in the future, it will be of great importance to the country's governance and the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, I cannot but speak sincerely. Today, after the National Government submits the draft constitution to the National Assembly, it can be said that the government has handed over the responsibility of the country to the people of the whole country. From today onwards, the people of the whole country will begin to bear this important responsibility." These enthusiastic and heartfelt words are enough to inspire every truly patriotic person and to admire Chairman Chiang's statesmanship, which is unmatched by anyone. Since the National Assembly opened on the 15th, the Chinese Communist Party and the China Democratic League have firmly refused to participate and have tried every means to sabotage it, saying that the National Assembly is a National Assembly monopolized by the Kuomintang and that the government's convening of the National Assembly has completely destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, after seeing the situation of the National Assembly's meeting and listening to Chairman Chiang's speech, we can know that the various claims of the Chinese Communist Party are either false or delusional. The Kuomintang is determined to return power to the people and naturally has no need to monopolize the National Assembly. In order to ensure that the draft constitution amendment is passed by the National Assembly, Chairman Chiang has spent countless words, sincerely explaining to the National Assembly representatives to consider the facts, abandon their prejudices, and accept this military constitution drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The so-called "facts speak louder than words," and it is self-evident who is destroying the Political Consultative Conference. As for the comments of foreign newspapers on the National Assembly, because foreigners do not understand the actual situation of our country's politics very well, they inevitably miss the point and have no value for debate.</p>
<p>In short, although Chairman Chiang is the Director-General of the Kuomintang, he has the magnanimity of regarding the world as his own and has absolutely no partisan prejudice. This is a strong guarantee for our country to embark on the road to democracy. Under his leadership, the Kuomintang is also brewing a new type of political party, which is to respect each other and tolerate each other. It is expected that the draft constitution amendment will be passed by the National Assembly, which is no longer a problem. This can really be regarded as a sign that our country's political situation will be clear from now on. All the National Assembly representatives attending the meeting should focus on the big picture in the constitution-making work, be able to see the big picture, and ensure that the National Assembly completes its constitution-making work as soon as possible. The 450 million people across the country are looking forward to Nanjing, hoping that the National Assembly's constitution-making will be smooth and have a satisfactory harvest. Since the National Assembly representatives have been entrusted with the important task of the people, they should base everything on public opinion. They should think about Chairman Chiang's speech yesterday again and again and earnestly follow it.</p>
<h3>Our Consul in Haiphong, Zhu Yuanzhang, Escapes from the Dangerous Area; Vietnamese Do Not Guarantee the Lives of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Haiphong, 27th] Our Consul in Haiphong, Zhu Yuanzhang, was rescued from the Vietnamese on the 26th by French troops. It is reported that the Vietnamese are fighting in the Overseas Chinese area and do not guarantee the lives of Overseas Chinese. The area controlled by the Vietnamese has become an extremely terrifying area. After our Consul in Haiphong left the dangerous area, the French army will launch a full-scale offensive against the Vietnamese. However, the French commander told Central News Agency reporters on the morning of the 26th that he would do his best to prevent further losses to Overseas Chinese. The French army's attack has started at noon on the 26th, but the situation in the French-controlled area on the 26th was excellent. Everything is very calm.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hanoi, 26th] (Delayed) French and Vietnamese Republic troops continue to fight in Haiphong and other places. French transport planes parachuted paratroopers to Hanoi today. Officials announced that the situation is under control. According to unconfirmed reports, French planes patrolled Haiphong and used machine guns to sink two Vietnamese arms ships.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Launch Fierce Attacks on the Su-Huai Highway, Attempting to Threaten Huaiyin; Yan'an Actively Repairs Airfields in Preparation for War</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Xuzhou on the 27th] The offensive of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly urgent. The National Army is in a completely defensive position because it is abiding by the ceasefire order.

<h3>Piecemeal Repair of the Jiangbei Canal; One Section in the Communist Area Could Not Be Surveyed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hongyin] The sluice gates and dams along the Jiangbei Canal were mostly destroyed by the enemy and the puppet regime. This time, when the Communist army retreated, they also dug up the embankment and broke the water, harming the people. The entire embankment of the canal needs to be repaired. The Canal Works Bureau is now actively planning to remedy this, and has specially divided the entire project into three sections: Jiangbao, Huaipi, and Yimuweilu, and established engineering offices and organized surveying teams to conduct surveys separately. The Jiangbao section starts from Jiangkou in the south and ends at Huangpu in Bao'ying in the north. Most of it was originally a stone embankment, which is badly broken and needs to be tidied up and repaired urgently. The survey has been completed and work will begin soon. The Huaipi section runs from Huangpu to Siyang and has also been divided into groups to survey the four transport embankment works of Qing'an, Yunkou, Qingjiang, and Pingqiao, which must be completed by the end of the month so that work can begin as soon as possible. However, the Yimuweilu section, which extends north from Siyang to Luguo, bears the waters of the Lu River and has a huge impact on northern Jiangsu. It is currently occupied by the Communist army, and surveying and estimating the land in person is not possible. However, we urgently hope that the embankment can be restored to ensure the safety of the counties along the canal.</p>

The Northern Jiangsu Health Work Team of the Health Department has established a branch team in Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Siyang, and other places.

Furthermore, the transportation in the recovered areas is not yet smooth, causing some delay in the supply of medicines, so it is not possible to fully meet the demands for widespread medical treatment. However, the department is currently feeling a lack of medical personnel. Many nurses were previously recruited and hired, but they have not yet reported for duty. Once they report, they will be dispatched to various places to serve, so as to extend services to the rural areas of each county where security has been established.</p>

<h3>Handling of Property Seized From Traitors in Various Places: Confiscated Items Should Be Sold Off Regularly</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou, 28th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has issued an order stating that many properties in provinces and cities have been seized from traitors. In the past, it was ordered to transfer them to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for disposal. However, now that the work of the Enemy Property Management Bureau is coming to an end, there are not many cases where the handling of traitor property has been completed.

<p>Why Are Streetlights Not Turned Off During the Day?</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Amidst the calls for energy conservation, and with the personal leadership and exhortation of Mayor Wu, the majority of merchants and residents have complied.</p>
<p>Today, at 9 AM, I happened to look up and see that the streetlights on Jinling Road were still on. I initially thought it was still early and that's why they hadn't been turned off, but to my surprise, they remained on until the evening. I thought of my own store, and out of fear of being penalized, we reduced our lighting, which, of course, has had a noticeable impact on our business. However, this was unavoidable. Could such a massive and useless loss also be saved? (Xu Misheng)</p>
<p>Protest Against the Wild Rise in Public Utility Rates</p>
<p>"Even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." Under the principle of living within one's means, all undertakings, if prices rise reasonably, should not only not be opposed, but should be enthusiastically supported so that the undertaking has hope for development. This time, the rise in public utility rates, if it doesn't rise, it's nothing, but once it rises, it's shocking, rising beyond reason, making us common citizens have to shout: "We can't take it anymore!"</p>
<p>The bus from Laoximen to Caojiadu was reduced to 300 yuan in the city council, but now it has risen to 600 yuan. The prices at that time were only a few percent higher than now, not doubled, but the fare has doubled, and I don't know what calculation it is based on? It is said that the profits of publicly-run enterprises go to the city treasury, taken from the people and used for the people, this is understandable; but what about the city ferry?</p>
<p>The price from the Floating Restaurant to Gao Temple was one jiao before the war, and now it has risen to 900 yuan (reported to have increased from November 25th, but in reality it has been increased for more than a week. The Han Decree seems to be equal to zero, making us ordinary people confused). It is nearly doubled compared to the cost of living index, and the city ferry has been changed to a joint government-business venture, which is too much to just seek exorbitant profits for businessmen! But let's not dwell on that; let's talk about the trackless trolley.</p>
<p>The trackless trolley from Jing'an Temple to Zhongshan Park was definitely less than three fen before the war, but now it has risen to 300 yuan, which is more than ten thousand times more, and the trolley company is a British company, so they must be shouting to England, wildly making money from us common citizens, how can this be explained?</p>
<p>During the period of occupation in this city, every "fair price" was unreasonable; I can't believe that there is such an unreasonable price increase under the blue sky and white sun. We common citizens are already like startled birds and are somewhat confused. Please give us a reasonable explanation! (Zhang Meimei)</p>
<p>(Editor's note) At the same time, we received a letter from Ji Yongqi, a reader from Longhua, stating: "We are students living in Longhua and have always walked through the wind and rain. This month, on the 18th, we saw that the city bus was already running on this road, so it was very convenient. However, the fare is too unreasonable, a flat rate of 1,000 yuan regardless of distance. This is another major blow! No! The citizens of Longhua also pay all kinds of taxes and fees. Why don't we receive the same treatment in terms of welfare as the urban areas? We hope that the municipal authorities will pay attention to this unreasonable fare and should calculate it based on distance. This is what the citizens of Longhua are asking for." Niu Nong's weeping in Yuyuan Road and Shen Tongjun also have the same voice, so they are published together.</p>
<p>Questioning the Charges for Dredging the River</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bao Chief of our Bao (Pudong North District) Yun Tai said that the Municipal Government ordered the dredging of the Wangjia Bang river channel, and the cost was to be collected at 5,000 yuan per mu of land, which is really difficult to understand. The Municipal Government's dredging of the river should first start with this small river, which is less than four li long and only three or four zhang wide. If it is related to national defense or an important transportation route, it should be borne jointly by the people of the scholar, industry, commerce, and other fields. If it is related to agricultural water conservancy, then the fundraising should not be limited to one profession, and it should be raised in the river basin to be reasonable.

<h3>Four Powers Reach Agreement on Major Contentious Points, Five-Nation Treaty Can Be Signed, Unexpected Gains from Days of Secret Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] The four foreign ministers held another secret meeting last night and reached an agreement on the major contentious points. The secret meeting seems to have produced good results. Observers hope that the peace treaty may be signed within a reasonable period. The following agreement was reached at the meeting regarding the Italian treaty, especially the status of the Port of Trieste:</p>
<p>(1) "Term of Garrisoning": The troops stationed in the Free Territory of Trieste will be subject to its simplified system within a few days after the Governor-General of Trieste takes office. After that, "the Allied forces will withdraw within 30 to 45 days, but if the Governor-General deems it necessary, the troops may continue to be stationed. (2) "Organization of the Provisional Government Council": The Governor-General will be appointed by the Security Council after consultation with Italy and Yugoslavia. After consulting with Italy and Yugoslavia, the Governor-General will appoint members of the Provisional Government Council from among the residents of Trieste. (3) "Election Deadline": The elections in Trieste will be held no later than four months after the Governor-General takes office. From then until then, the military government will still exercise power, and the British, American, and Yugoslav troops will remain in their current areas of stationing.</p>
<p>In addition, agreements were reached on the most-favored-nation clause regarding Italy's compensation issue, civil aviation, and the possibility of holding an international conference to investigate the free navigation of the Danube. The representatives of the four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM today to draft the final draft of yesterday's agreement.</p>
<p>The four foreign ministers themselves are scheduled to continue their discussion at 9:00 PM to discuss two issues: first, the detailed reports submitted by the economic experts on various points of agreement; second, the Danube navigation issue.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign Troops of Various Countries Will Be Investigated Simultaneously, Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly Passes British Proposal, Soviet Union Suffers Triple Defeat</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] At today's meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suffered a triple defeat. First, the committee adopted the Soviet proposal that all United Nations countries publish the number of their troops stationed abroad by January 1 of next year, but amended the proposal so that all countries should simultaneously publish the number of all their domestic military forces. Mr. Molotov tried his best to oppose it, but it was passed in the end. Second, Mr. Molotov's request that the committee adopt Egypt's proposal that British troops stationed in non-enemy countries should be withdrawn immediately in all cases except for special circumstances also failed. Third, Mr. Molotov attempted to force the United States and Britain to publish the number of all their atomic bombs, rockets, and other secret weapons by January 1 of next year, but the committee even refused to submit this proposal for a vote.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 27th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly today passed a British proposal by a vote of 40 to 10, stipulating a general investigation of the foreign troops of various countries in the world. The Soviet Union vehemently opposed it to no avail. The Soviet Union argued that the investigation should be limited to foreign troops, and domestic troops could be involved in future discussions on disarmament. At the same time, the committee rejected the Soviet Union's request to investigate all secret weapons such as atomic bombs and rockets. Earlier, the committee chairman, Ukrainian representative Manuilsky, had twice attempted to submit the Soviet Union's arms investigation proposal, which immediately caused a heated debate. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also attempted to prevent the British proposal from being put to a vote, wanting to add the phrase "and the military equipment that can be used domestically" to it. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 24 to 18. The United States proposed an amendment to the British proposal, deleting the phrase "the United Nations Security Council dispatches supervisors to review in the field," which the committee passed by a vote. The Soviet Union then proposed that "when the Security Council discusses disarmament issues, each country should report the situation of its domestic troops and military equipment to the Security Council," which the committee again rejected by a vote of 31 to 10. Although the troop investigation proposal still awaits the final vote of the General Assembly, the result of today's committee vote will not be overturned. The committee finally rejected Egypt's provisional motion by a vote of 29 to 13. The Egyptian proposal argued that the General Assembly should notify member states that all those who have troops stationed in the territory of other member states should withdraw immediately, except as provided by the United Nations Charter. The US representative said that this case must be carefully considered, but the Soviet Union expressed its support. The committee then adjourned until Thursday.</p>
<h3>US Willing to Release Army Numbers</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 27th] According to authoritative sources: If the United Nations organization passes a proposal requiring all countries to declare the actual numbers of their domestic and foreign troops, the US Army Department is prepared and extremely willing to release these figures. Official sources pointed out that the number of US Army troops is largely known to the world because the United States practices a democratic system, and military expenditures must be approved by Congress, so the actual number of troops cannot be concealed. For example, the number of US Army personnel will reach 1.3 million by the end of this year, but will decrease to 1.07 million by June 1947. This is well known to the world. Although the number of troops stationed abroad has not been announced, a fairly accurate approximation can be obtained by calculating based on newspaper records.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Mandated Islands - US Plans Separate Management</h3>
<p>Schles declares at the Trusteeship Council</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 27th] The UN Trusteeship Council held a meeting today. US representative Schles stated that the United States refuses to disarm its land and naval bases in trust territories until the UN organization has established an effective collective security system. However, in order to disarm bases in trust territories, we must create a situation that can guarantee security. In other words, the Military Staff Committee and the Atomic Energy Commission must be able to determine effective methods to control armaments, and at the same time, the Security Council must be able to avoid the general paralysis caused by the exercise of the veto power. In short, the United States intends to independently administer the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific, where there are air and naval bases on each island. At this point, the representative of New Zealand stood up and stated that the draft trusteeship agreement for Samoa, a territory under its trusteeship, proposed by New Zealand, has been proposed by the Soviet Union for amendment. If the Soviet amendment is passed, New Zealand will withdraw the draft trusteeship agreement and, if necessary, continue to control Samoa without the consent of the United Nations organization. According to the amendment proposed by the Soviet Union, it is argued that the strategic areas within the trust territories should be controlled by the Security Council, and the trustee state has no right to designate strategic areas on its own.</p>
<h3>China Suggests Establishing a Committee to Handle International Relief</h3>
<p>US Offers Three Specific Methods</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 27th] The UN Economic and Financial Committee met today to discuss the suggestion made by the Chinese representative, which advocates that after the dissolution of the UNRRA, an international committee should be established to be responsible for distributing relief materials to various countries in need, based entirely on the nature of relief, without regard to political reasons. The US representative also made a suggestion, strongly arguing that a number of countries should be given financial assistance after the UNRRA is dissolved, in order to purchase food from foreign countries. There are three specific methods: (1) The UN General Assembly should ask the Secretariat to send a list of needed relief materials to all member states of the UN Committee; (2) Request each member state to donate relief materials to the best of its ability in the coming year; (3) Invite the member states that donate relief materials to adjust their relief procedures.</p>
<h3>Hunting Season Near in the US - He Yingqin to Hunt Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, Charleston, West Virginia, 28th] The West Virginia hunting season will begin on Monday. Preston has been organizing hunting groups. The Chinese military representative to the United Nations, General He Yingqin, and the Deputy Commander of the Chinese Air Force, Mao Bangchu, will each participate in the hunt with an aide.</p>
<h3>Muslim League Accepts British Invitation - Jinnah to Visit London Personally - Congress Party and Sikhs Refuse</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 27th] It is learned that the Muslim League has accepted the invitation of the British government and agreed to send a delegation to London with the Viceroy of India, Wavell, but the Congress Party and the Sikhs have refused. Wavell is scheduled to fly to London on the 30th of this month and is expected to stay for ten days. The Viceroy's affairs will be temporarily taken over by Corrin starting from the first of next month. In addition, it is learned that the Finance Minister of the Indian Interim Government, Liakat Ali Khan (Muslim League), met with Wavell today and informed him that the Muslim League had accepted the invitation of the British government. After leaving, he held a meeting with other leaders of the Muslim League at his residence. Afterwards, according to a spokesman for the Muslim League, Minister Liakat Ali Khan and the Chairman of the Muslim League, Jinnah, have agreed to personally visit London. Nehru of the Congress Party stated that he has submitted a memorandum to the British government explaining the reasons for the rejection. The Congress Party believes that it has fully accepted the British plan, so there is no need for further discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 27th] The Congress Party announced that if the London talks unilaterally decide to make concessions to the Muslim League, all ministers of the Congress Party in the Indian Interim Government will resign. The Indian Constituent Assembly was originally scheduled to open on December 9. If it is decided to postpone it, it will be regarded as a new concession, and the Congress Party cannot remain silent. A reporter asked Nehru whether the Congress Party's decision to refuse to participate in the London conference could no longer be changed. Nehru replied that in this ever-changing world, how can there be anything that is immutable?</p>
<h3>Indian Students Lack Discipline - Only Want to See Plays, Not Study</h3>
<p>Lucknow University Closed by Government</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lucknow, 27th] The government of the United Provinces of India has ordered the closure of Lucknow University until the school's Standing Committee can restore student discipline. The reason is that the students had launched a movement to demand preferential treatment for students from theaters, which caused disputes, and even some students held demonstrations outside the Secretariat. The government stated that the students' discipline is deteriorating, and they have no regard for the law. They do not know how to study, only how to see plays. For the sake of the students' future, they must be punished, it is said.</p>
<h3>British Navy Completely Withdraws from Alexandria</h3>
<p>Two Egyptian Universities Closed</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 27th] The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt is progressing gradually. The British Navy announced that the Royal Navy has almost completely withdrawn from Alexandria. It is expected that the British Army will soon announce the withdrawal of the Army from Egypt. The work of transferring the British Army Headquarters to the Suez Canal Zone has also made considerable progress. At the same time, due to Egyptian Prime Minister Sedky's obtaining a vote of confidence in the Parliament, it is generally believed that the Anglo-Egyptian treaty will soon be approved. The Egyptian Cabinet will soon send a senior representative, possibly Foreign Minister Hafez, to London to finalize the treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 28th] After three consecutive days of student riots, the Egyptian government has ordered the closure of Cairo University and Alexandria's Farouk University until further notice.</p>
<h3>Six US President Liners - Scheduled to Depart from San Francisco</h3>

<h3>All Treaties Torn into Waste Paper - Iranian Government Forces Press on Azerbaijan Province - Azerbaijan Constructs Fortifications to Resist</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 28th] The Azerbaijan radio station announced that after the Iranian government forces approached the province of Azerbaijan, all agreements concluded between the province and the government were declared invalid. It is reported that the Iranian government ordered its troops this morning to prepare to enter the province of Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 28th] According to today's news, the government of Azerbaijan appears to be reaffirming its independence. It is currently building bunkers to prevent the Iranian government from sending troops from Tehran to the province to monitor the elections. Tehran newspapers reported that General Anushi's troops in Azerbaijan are rushing to build defensive fortifications near the provincial border about 65 miles north of Zenjan. Iranian government forces departed from Zenjan yesterday and advanced towards the provincial border.</p>
<h3>Bidault Cabinet Resigns - Communists Nominate Leader Thorez to Succeed as Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Bidault Cabinet submitted its resignation today at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly. The Communist Party has nominated Thorez as the successor to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The French Cabinet held a meeting. First, the interim President and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault read out the Cabinet's letter of resignation, which is planned to be delivered to the Speaker of the National Assembly tomorrow. Then, the Overseas Minister, Moutet, reported on the policies adopted in Vietnam. President Bidault also expressed his approval, and the Cabinet meeting passed it without discussion.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] When the new French National Assembly opened today, the Communist Party formally announced its demand to obtain the post of Prime Minister. The resignation of the Bidault Cabinet is only a formality, because the government often resigns when the new parliament is convened, so it is not an unexpected move. The new government will not take office until the first president of the Fourth Republic is elected in January next year. The Communist Party's opposition to the Bidault Cabinet remaining as a caretaker government has caused quite a stir. Before the opening of the parliament, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decided to take immediate action to nominate party leader Thorez as Prime Minister. The resolution called for the organization of a "democratic coalition government, presided over by the Communist Party, in order to implement national revival, social progress, democratic revival, and French independence." Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos declared that the Communist Party's program aims at reforming industry, reviving agriculture, and controlling foreign trade. Thorez himself emphasized that the biggest problem at present is to increase production and improve the living standards of the masses. People in the parliamentary lounge expressed doubt about the Communist Party's chances of winning a majority in parliament, because the Communist Party only occupies 183 seats out of the 615 seats in the parliament. It goes without saying that other parties will not cooperate with the Communist Party, and even whether the Socialist Party will support it is questionable. However, the mere fact that the Communist Party has nominated its leader to serve as Prime Minister has forced the parliament to split. The biggest goal of the Communist Party in doing so is probably to put the Socialist Party in a dilemma. Most people expect Bidault to win a majority and remain as Prime Minister, and even if the Communist Party opposes it, it may not shake it. It is true that the majority of members of Bidault's Popular Republican Party not only oppose the Communist Party serving as Prime Minister, but even oppose the Communist Party participating in the cabinet. However, it is generally expected that if Bidault is re-elected as Prime Minister, he will naturally recruit the Communist Party into the cabinet. Although the Communist Party is disappointed because it cannot obtain the post of Prime Minister, it seems very likely to accept it.</p>
<h3>US Civil Aeronautics Board to Open Round-the-World Air Routes - Shanghai as Liaison Station - Sino-US Negotiations in Progress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] China seems to have become the key to the United States opening round-the-world aviation. Robertsson, Deputy Director of the US Civil Aeronautics Board, returned here today after inspecting the East. According to his talk, the United States is negotiating with China for reciprocal rights of aerial landing, and the opening of the round-the-world airline depends on these negotiations. Robertson hopes that the line will be opened within April and said that offices are being established in Tokyo, Manila, Shanghai, Sydney, and somewhere in India to oversee the safety matters before the opening of the line.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Regarding the two round-the-world air routes planned by the US Civil Aeronautics Board, with Shanghai as the liaison station, one is operated by Pan American Airlines and will fly around the world via Shanghai. The other will be jointly operated by two airlines. First, a Trans World Airlines plane will take off from the United States with passengers, pass through Europe, the Middle East, India, to Shanghai, and then a Northwest Airlines plane will fly from Shanghai across the Pacific to the United States.</p>

<h3>Lewis Should Appear in Court - Judge Grants Ten-Day Grace Period, Orders Immediate Cessation of Labor Disputes - Coal Shortage, Wartime Blackout Restrictions Restored</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] As the trial of United Mine Workers President Lewis for contempt of court begins, the judge has sternly rebuked him. Based on the current situation, it appears that it will be quite difficult for Lewis to be acquitted of this charge. The Federal Court is on holiday today due to Thanksgiving, but initial contacts between the authorities and Lewis are clearly unfavorable to Lewis's defense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] As the coal mine strike intensifies and chokes US industry, United Mine Workers President Lewis was tried today by Federal Judge Goldsborough. Goldsborough accused Lewis of defying the injunction and refusing to maintain the current agreement between the miners and the mine owners. The Federal Judge will also rule on whether the court has the right to issue an injunction against the coal mine strike in the next few days. The union's lawyer argued in court that the "Restrictions on Court Injunctions Act" restricts the court from issuing injunctions in labor-management disputes, so the injunction issued by Goldsborough to Lewis cannot take effect. The judge replied that if the "Restrictions on Court Injunctions Act" applies to this case, there may be no need for a jury. The labor unrest has idled 8 million steel, railroad, and river transportation workers. Most cities across the country have restored wartime blackout restrictions. Government economists warned that there may be a food panic in major cities. One economist said that the disaster of a three-month strike is unimaginable. Most schools have extended their Thanksgiving holidays for several days, citing a lack of coal. The school closures are not entirely due to the coal mine strike. For example, in St. Paul, Minnesota, teachers are on strike demanding a raise, so the schools are closed. Students in some areas continue to receive lessons on the radio. National Association of Broadcasters President Miller has notified all radio stations to broadcast daily school programs in areas where schools are closed.</p>
<p>Lewis's Lawyers Argue Strike Was Spontaneous</p>
<p>About 400,000 coal miners are on strike, and 1.9 million workers in coal-using industries are affected. The Department of Agriculture has repeatedly warned that if the strike lasts for only 20 days and railroad transportation is suspended, there is a danger of food shortages in various cities. Residents in eastern regions have no coal to burn, so they have to wear thicker clothes to keep warm. Within a week, 200,000 people in this area will be idle. Most factories, especially steel mills, are gradually reducing work. US Steel Company will announce the closure of some factories next week, and large and small industries are expected to begin shutting down next week. The industrial areas of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio are the most severely affected. Within a week, there will be 100,000 idle workers; Illinois will also have 100,000 idle workers within ten days. The automotive industry has not been severely affected, but it has also decided to extend the Thanksgiving holiday to next Monday to save coal.</p>
<p>Lewis's Lawyers Argue Strike Was Spontaneous</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Federal Court Judge Goldsborough has decided to grant Lewis a ten-day grace period to stop the labor unrest. It is also learned that Lewis's "defendant's defense stated that the miners decided to strike because they believed that all conditions were unbearable, and not because they were instigated by union leaders. Lewis did not violate the law, nor did he disregard the law, and the case should be dismissed." After the defense counsel and the prosecutor discussed the matter, the court decided to adjourn the court and resume the trial on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Jewish Terrorist Group - Issues Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 28th] The Jewish terrorist group, the Stern Gang, issued a "ceasefire order" to its sabotage squads last night. A notice signed by the group's commander-in-chief, Yellin, was found on the streets of Tel Aviv, stating that due to the city's industrial importance to Palestine, they have decided to temporarily suspend attacks on the railway.</p>
<h3>Greek Air Force Deployed - Bombing Northern Rebels</h3>
<p>Yugoslavia Strengthens Border Defenses</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 27th] The Greek Air Force today deployed to bomb the rebels near Mount Bajkus in western Macedonia, while the army also increased its forces there, determined to wipe out the rebels entrenched in the villages there.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 26th] The Greek Foreign Ministry announced today that the Yugoslav government has notified the Greek ambassador to Yugoslavia that due to a large number of Greeks seeking to escape the terror in northern Greece, Yugoslavia has increased its troops along the border as a precaution.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Attitude - Says He is Deeply Aware of the Economic Crisis, Hopes for Socialist Party Cooperation - Economic Revival Still Requires US Assistance</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 28th] After being fiercely criticized by the Socialist Party in the Diet today, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida expressed his attitude, saying that the government is deeply aware of the seriousness of Japan's economic crisis and has established a policy centered on economic issues, which is currently being implemented. When it is impossible to implement, he may resort to dissolving the Diet, but there is no such consideration at present. He hopes that the Socialist Party will abandon its attitude of struggling with the government and work together to rebuild Japan through cooperative actions. Please do not force me on the question of my future progress and retreat.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] Since Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Hoshijima recently made a statement to many financial experts, expressing that Japan's economic situation is very optimistic, Prime Minister Yoshida issued a statement to the press yesterday, believing that Japan's economic recovery still requires US assistance, which suddenly diluted the optimistic atmosphere. Observers here commented that Yoshida's statement has another purpose. There are two purposes: (1) To use the fear of communism to induce the United States to increase aid to Japan; (2) To postpone the cleansing of Japanese government agencies.</p>
<h3>Head of Chinese Medical Delegation Talks About Impressions of Inspection in the US</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Xu, Chief of the Medical Department of the Chinese Army, led a medical and pharmaceutical inspection delegation of 100 members of the Army to the United States in August to inspect the medical and pharmaceutical facilities of the US Army. He expressed his views for the first time today, saying that the Chinese Army only has three or four thousand military doctors, but in reality, it needs at least 30,000. This was the need when he left Nanjing, and now it may need more military doctors. He and the delegation members are currently studying the US Army's medical and pharmaceutical institutions and surgical methods and know that its entire organization is quite excellent, but it may not be fully applicable to China's current economic and political situation. He was very impressed by the US Army's and the civilian medical community's efforts to cooperate. China also needs this kind of cooperation, and he hopes to promote it after returning to China. Xu and several delegation members will return to China in February next year, but most of the delegation members will remain in the United States for eight months to continue their inspection.</p>

<h3>Another Danish Legend: Hitler Died in a Submarine</h3>
<p>Mysterious Documents Washed Ashore</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 27th] Mysterious documents were recently washed ashore on the Danish coast, claiming that Hitler died on a submarine on November 10, 1945. The documents have been handed over to the Danish Supreme Police Authority today, which will decide whether to investigate them. It is generally accepted that Hitler burned himself to death in a bunker on the eve of the fall of Berlin, but there is a lack of conclusive evidence.</p>
<h3>The Reorganization of the Indian Government (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India</p>
<p>(A dispatch from Delhi, India, November 4th) Human peace and national self-determination are the unanimous calls of enlightened nations in the 20th century. Of course, India, with its population of 400 million and its status as an ancient Eastern country, cannot be allowed to remain under foreign rule and should have an autonomous position. Therefore, since the British Labour Party formed a cabinet, it has recognized this point and intends to gradually hand over power to India, enabling it to achieve complete freedom and independence within ten or even five years. This is a truly brilliant policy that will write a glorious page in British colonial history. Thus, in February of this year, the British Labour Cabinet sent the Secretary of State for India, Lord Lawrence, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, and the President of the Board of Trade, Cripps, to India to negotiate the issue of Indian independence with leaders of various Indian political parties. After several months, a declaration was issued, urging the Congress Party and the Muslim League to jointly form a cabinet.</p>
<p>At that time, both the Congress and the League originally intended to jointly form a provisional central government. However, the Congress Party soon became unwilling to participate and wished to join the Constituent Assembly, while the Muslim League was unable to form a cabinet on its own. Consequently, the matter of the two parties forming a government dissolved into nothing. However, the Labour government felt that the failure of this matter was not a good solution and ordered the Viceroy of India, Wavell, to encourage the Congress Party to form a government alone. The Muslim League felt that the British were selling out the League and convened a Central Executive Meeting, announcing the cancellation of the previous agreement. That is, the Muslim League would neither participate in the government nor join the Constituent Assembly and further decided to hold a "Direct Action Day" on August 16th to demonstrate and resist the Congress Party.</p>
<p>Indeed, from August 16th to 19th, the tragedy of the Calcutta massacre occurred. The total number of deaths and injuries among Hindus and Muslims reached over 15,000, a major catastrophe in history. At that time, the reporter was still in Calcutta and witnessed the scene. Even the old, weak, women, and children could not escape being hacked to death with sharp axes, making one's heart ache. Since then, a low pressure in the Indian political situation has spread to every corner of India. People, both Chinese and foreign, witnessing the once infinitely bright Indian independence movement suddenly overshadowed by an unexpected darkness, were filled with regret and utter depression. Until September 2nd, the President of the Congress Party, Nehru, unable to obtain the Muslim League's consent to jointly form a cabinet, proceeded to form a government on his own, striving for India's independence and freedom. The Muslim League believed that Nehru's actions were a manifestation of Hindu imperialism, seeking to place 100 million Muslims under Hindu rule. To express their resistance, they instructed all Indian Muslims to hang black flags on the day the new government was established to show that this day was the darkest day in Indian history. However, Nehru ultimately formed the new government.</p>
<p>In several provinces of British India, the cabinets were controlled by the Muslim League, and unrest continued to occur in places such as Bombay and Dhaka. Although the central government was established, its authority did not extend to the local level. To ensure domestic security and cooperation between the two parties, the Muslim League had to participate in the government to have power. In early October, the Viceroy of India, Wavell, invited the leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, to Delhi for negotiations. Indeed, Jinnah also arrived here from Bombay by ship with his daughter in early October, and an atmosphere of peace once again permeated all parts of India.</p>
<p>After Jinnah arrived in Delhi, he met with Viceroy Wavell four times. Subsequently, the Viceroy flew to other places for inspection. The Indian negotiation issue was then mediated by the Maharaja of Patiala. The Maharaja of Patiala was the chairman of the Chamber of Princes of India and also a Muslim. Therefore, he had easy access to both the Indian and Muslim sides. After several rounds of mediation, lasting a week, from morning to night, without rest, negotiations ultimately failed. One reason was Jinnah's demand for "Pakistan" (Editor's Note: meaning the partition of India and Pakistan), and the other was the Muslim League's insistence on representing all Muslims. The Congress Party believed that both of these points were unacceptable. Establishing Pakistan would be equivalent to dividing India into two countries. Based on the recent general election, the Muslim League representatives were not all elected, and some Muslims belonging to the Congress Party were elected. Therefore, it was believed that the Muslim League had no right to represent all Muslims. On October 11th, the negotiations between the two parties completely failed.</p>
<p>By October 13th, Jinnah, seeing that the negotiations between the two parties had failed, went to Wavell himself to explain that negotiations did not have to go through an agreement between the two parties and that the Muslim League could still nominate five representatives to participate in the provisional central government. After Jinnah returned to his residence, he convened an executive committee meeting to discuss the matter. This time, the Muslim League resolutely joined the new government. According to a commentary in the Calcutta "Star of India" (a Muslim League newspaper), "The Muslim League may not want any agreement with the Congress Party and will decide to join the new government on its own. In this way, the Muslim League does not have to sacrifice its fundamental demands and claims and does not have to recognize the demands of the Congress Party. This approach is beneficial to the Muslim League and can limit the dictatorship of Patel (the current Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Information) in the new government. It may be able to stop the inspection of letters from Muslim League leaders, preventing the struggle of the Muslim nation to fight for Pakistan from being hindered."</p>
<p>The Calcutta Hindu newspaper "Hindustan Standard" made the following comment on the Muslim League's decision to participate in the new government without consulting with the Congress Party: "Hindus account for 75% of the Indian population. According to the allocation of seats in the new government, among the six seats obtained by the Congress Party, one is for a Muslim and one is for a member of the scheduled castes, while the remaining four seats are for Hindus. However, Muslims account for only 25% of the total population of India, and the Muslim League's Muslim representatives occupy five seats. Adding the six non-Muslim League Muslim representatives in the Congress Party's quota, Muslims actually get six seats. This is inevitably unfair to the Hindu majority, but it still cannot satisfy the Muslim League. It is known that although the negotiations failed, the Muslim League still decided to join the cabinet to enjoy its benefits. Is there any motive? It is unknown. Does the Muslim League want to go in and disrupt things, create a stalemate, and obstruct the good policies that the Congress Party intends to implement? Is it conspiring to encourage the Governor-General to intervene, making the world believe that Britain has not handed over power to the Indians during the transition period? The Muslim League probably hopes to rely on the power of the Churchill group and reactionary British forces in India to obstruct India's progress towards freedom."</p>
<p>The Muslim leader of the Northwest Frontier Province of India, Ghaffar Khan, although a Muslim, followed Gandhi all his life. Therefore, Indians call him the Frontier Gandhi to show their respect. He believed that the Muslim League's participation in the government was a trap by Governor-General Wavell. He said: "It is regrettable that the Muslim League leaders did not reach a solution with the Congress Party but instead privately resolved the matter with the Governor-General. The Governor-General realized that the Congress Party representatives in the new government were acting in unison, and the Governor-General seemed to be in a difficult situation. Therefore, he naturally turned to his old friend, the Muslim League, to rescue him."</p>
<h3>Four Points in the Proposal for Improving China's Agriculture Presented to Truman by Hutchison</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Associated Press] Hutchison, Dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of California, recently submitted a proposal to Truman from the agricultural delegation that went to China to improve Chinese agriculture. Later, when he spoke to officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he also mentioned the contents of the proposal. It is said that before leaving China, he submitted several reports to several senior Chinese officials, Ambassador Stuart, and Marshall. He stated that if the Chinese government can actively revitalize and implement a strong agricultural plan, then most of the unrest in the country will gradually calm down, as the unrest in China mostly comes from rural areas. Hutchison greatly praised the goodness of Chinese farmers, but said that they still need to improve in many ways. He especially suggested four points: (1) expand the application of improved crop varieties; (2) use chemical fertilizers in large quantities and reduce the use of current organic fertilizers; (3) find ways to prevent pests and plant and animal diseases; and (4) develop irrigation. He finally said that China needs to promote its education, and its current agricultural education base is backward, so it is not enough to meet the needs of a large number of people. It also said that the delegation suggested that the national government should curb the rapid increase in population. He went on to say that, according to Chinese business giants, China's current resources are sufficient to support the lives of more than 200 million people. He believes that unless China changes this concept through education, it will continue to suffer.</p>

<h3>New Taxes Increase, Disputes Increase Daily, Urgent Need to Evaluate Various Disputes and Improve Collection Procedures, Tax Review Council to Convene a Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to implement simplified tax collection procedures, the City Government established a Tax Review Council under the Finance Bureau. The organization of the council was recently approved by the Municipal Council. The council consists of one representative from the City Government, the Director or Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, one representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, the chief of the tax department of the Finance Bureau, one representative from the City Chamber of Commerce, two representatives from relevant trade associations, one representative from the Municipal Council, and one designated accountant. Now, the Finance Bureau, in view of the increase in new taxes, especially the increasing number of disputes over the Municipal Construction Donation and Housing Donation, needs to convene a review council. It recently sent letters to the relevant agencies and groups, requesting them to quickly nominate representatives to the council for discussion. It is learned that the scope of the council meeting is as follows: (1) Evaluate whether taxpayers should be exempted from taxes; (2) Evaluate the business capital of taxpayers; (3) Evaluate the total business income of taxpayers; (4) Evaluate the amount of tax payable by taxpayers; (5) Evaluate various disputes regarding taxes; (6) Evaluate cases involving various tax regulations that should be transferred to the court; (7) Suggest improvements to tax collection procedures; (8) Other matters that may be submitted for review or examination in accordance with various tax regulations.</p>
<p>If Dissatisfied, Reconsideration May Be Requested</p>
<p>The interim regulations also stipulate in Article 3: The tax authority or the taxpayer may, except in the case of the above-mentioned Article 6, if they are dissatisfied with the evaluation event, state the reasons and provide evidence to request reconsideration. If they are still dissatisfied after the reconsideration evaluation, they may submit it to the Municipal Government for approval. Article 6: Members of this council should recuse themselves from attending evaluation events related to themselves, otherwise the evaluation shall be invalid. Article 7: The meeting of this council must have a quorum of more than half of the members present to be held, and the decision shall be made by a majority vote of the members present at the meeting. The presiding officer shall decide in the case of a tie. (The presiding officer shall be the Director or Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau.) Article 10. When necessary, the council may notify taxpayers to attend the meeting for inquiries and may review their account books and related documents.</p>
<h3>City Tax Increase This Month, More Than 3 Billion Yuan More Than Last Month, Slaughter Tax Also Adjusted Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The city Finance Bureau's tax revenue for this month, as of yesterday, has reached 11 billion yuan in legal tender, an increase of 3 billion yuan compared to the entire previous month. This is due to the levy of the Municipal Construction Donation and the increase in Feast Tax and Entertainment Tax.</p>
<p>Due to rising prices, the Slaughter Tax will be adjusted starting in December. The new price is as follows: 10,000 yuan per head of cattle (old tax was 9,100 yuan), 8,000 yuan per pig (old tax was 5,600 yuan). It has been filed by the Municipal Council and approved by the Municipal Government. The Slaughter Tax was originally levied at 5% of the price. Since the price of meat changes frequently, it is calculated based on the lowest wholesale price and adjusted once every considerable period. Recently, the price of meat has been rising continuously, and the amount of Slaughter Tax should also be increased. Hu Youyuan, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, told reporters that the tax standard set this time is still lower than the lowest wholesale price.</p>
<p>The Autumn Municipal Construction Donation has been progressing vigorously since its levy, and the revenue collected next month is expected to be higher, estimated to reach 3 billion yuan. As for the Winter Municipal Construction Donation, it may be postponed until the beginning of next year. All Municipal Construction Donations are separated from the City Government's other tax revenues and are used purely for municipal construction.</p>
<p>Government Agencies and Schools Must Pay Housing Donation</p>
<p>Government agencies, registered schools, and purely charitable organizations are usually exempt from Housing Donation for the buildings they use. When the Municipal Council passed the Municipal Construction Donation, there was a clause that "unless otherwise provided by law, there shall be no exemption." Regarding this point, the Municipal Government and the Finance Bureau recently sent a letter to the Finance Group of the Municipal Council. According to the reply, "the decision is still not to exempt." Therefore, the buildings of the above-mentioned three agencies and organizations must also pay the Municipal Construction Donation uniformly.</p>
<h3>Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for Business Tax, the City Chamber of Commerce Requests Appropriate Amendments</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce believes that Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Business Tax lacks the advantages of flexibility and has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting appropriate amendments so that taxes can be levied according to industry and grade. The original telegram stated: "Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Business Tax states that 'other industries shall uniformly levy 1.5% of their total business income.' This fails to take into account the advantages of flexibility in Article 4 of the Business Tax Law, firmly upholding the established case of uniform tax rates. This is beyond the expectations of general industry and commerce and causes widespread disappointment. According to what the association has learned, local tax authorities also deeply believe that it is most reasonable to levy Business Tax according to industry and grade. However, due to the restrictions of Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation, it is impossible to handle. Therefore, we do not dare to be presumptuous and earnestly request your ministry to review and approve the amendment of Article 14 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Business Tax, with reference to the pre-war established cases and the current requests of various industries, so as to achieve the effect of promoting benefits."</p>
<h3>Thai Ambassador to China, Dula Raleuk, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Thai Ambassador to China, Dula Raleuk, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong today and will go to Beijing on the first of next month to present his credentials. Those who came with him include his secretary and the principal of the embassy, as well as accompanying interpreters.</p>
<h3>Grand Celebration of Panama's National Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of Panama's National Day. The Panamanian Embassy in Shanghai held a reception at the embassy on Hongqiao Road from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM to entertain Chinese and foreign envoys. In the twilight, there was a lot of traffic on Hongqiao Road. The grand celebration did not end until after 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Chen Qicai, Xu Enzeng, and Others Registered as Party Members Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Qicai, Xu Enzeng, and Xu Guomao, Fan Heyan, Fei Xia, and others from the financial sector went to the city party headquarters on Aitang Road yesterday morning to complete the party member registration procedures. Director Fang was in Beijing on official business, so Secretary-General Xie and other members received them on his behalf and took a group photo to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Tao Xingzhi Public Funeral in Nanjing, Preparations for Memorial Service by All Sectors</h3>
<p>Tao Xingzhi's coffin will be publicly buried in Nanjing. It is reported that many people from the Shanghai cultural circles, such as Tian Han and Hong Shen, will hold a memorial service in Shanghai and then escort the coffin to Beijing to participate in the public funeral ceremony. On the Shanghai side, the original designated host, Shen Hengshan, could not return in time from Beijing, so Huang Renzhi was changed to preside over the service at the North Railway Station, and Wang Shaoyu presided over the service at the Ningbo Guild Hall. On the Nanjing side, the farmers in Xiaozhuang and the surrounding areas, feeling deeply grateful for Tao's deep love and care for them during his lifetime, are now arranging a roadside memorial service.</p>
<h3>Employee Meals and Accommodation, Exempt from Remuneration Income Tax, Cash Payments Still Subject to Tax</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, based on the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance handling the way to pay the income tax on the amount of salary and remuneration in the second category B, specially forwarded a letter to the members of the association and the member stores for information. The letter roughly stated: "The letter from the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance dated the 23rd of this month, Hu Zhi Er Zi No. 5067, stated: According to the Ministry of Finance's telex of November 14, 35th year of the Republic of China, Jing Zhi Yi (35) Zi No. 10371, it is found that the provision of meals and accommodation for employees by agencies, legal entities, or companies is a type of allowance, and there is nothing wrong with including it in the salary and allowance to calculate the income tax on salary and remuneration in the second category B. However, this type of allowance, in terms of accommodation, is mostly a surplus of public housing, and in terms of meals, the number of meals provided per day varies, so it is appropriate to say that it is a benefit and preferential treatment for employees, but it is not appropriate to call it a fixed allowance, and the calculation is also difficult. For the convenience of tax collection, it is stipulated that in the future, agencies, legal entities, or companies shall not include the provision of meals and accommodation for employees when calculating the income tax on salary and remuneration in the first category B, but cash payments in the form of allowances shall still be combined for taxation. We hope you will inform your subordinates accordingly."</p>
<h3>Key Points of Household Registration Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The city's household registration has been implemented since September 17, and the city government has been handling it very seriously. Recently, it has been conducting extensive publicity, hoping that citizens will understand the household registration laws and register in accordance with the law to obtain guarantees. Household registration includes four types: (1) Registration of Origin - Registration of the establishment or removal of a person's origin. The origin is based on the province and the county to which it belongs. Origin is divided into two types: native origin and domicile origin. A person may establish both a native origin and a domicile origin, but a person may not have two native origins or domicile origins at the same time. (2) Registration of Identity - Registration of various matters related to a person's identity. Currently, the seven types that have been started are birth, adoption, recognition, marriage, divorce, death, and death declaration. (3) Migration Registration - Two types of registration: moving in and moving out. (4) Registration of Floating Population - Registration of the population that has resided for less than one month and whose mobility is irregular.</p>
<p>All applications for household registration shall be made within 15 days after the occurrence or confirmation of the event, but registration of moving out shall be made in advance, and registration of the floating population shall be made on the same day. In addition to the registration of the floating population, which can be verbally applied directly to the Bao Office, the remaining applications shall be obtained from the Jia Head, filled out, and submitted to the Jia Head for verification and transfer.</p>
<p>The Mayor on Jiangwan Street (Photo by Yu Chuangshuo of this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Mayor Inspects Jiangwan Down the Countryside, Visits the People's Livelihood and Meets with the Garrison</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from this Newspaper] A cold wind overnight, I don't know how many yellow leaves have fallen; the ladies of the city are the most sensitive, and have already shrunk their heads into heavy furs.</p>
<p>Jiangwan, a northern suburb more than ten kilometers away from here, borders the Huangpu River and has a sparse population. Severe winter in Jiangwan will be an even deeper threat. Fortunately, on the first day of the early cold this winter, Mayor Wu brought them warmth.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu went to Jiangwan yesterday morning at 8:00 AM to inspect the 21st and 22nd districts on Qimei Road and Kuizhao Road. The places he visited included: rice shops, meat shops, barber shops, cotton shops, hardware stores, blacksmith shops, bicycle shops, cigarette paper and match shops, tea houses, etc. When Mayor Wu checked the rice shop, he asked: "How much does a dan of rice cost?" When he checked the meat shop, he asked: "How much does a jin of pork cost?" In addition, detailed inquiries were made about how much it costs to get a haircut, how much profit can be made from a batch of cotton, and how much monthly salary an apprentice in a iron shop receives.</p>
<h3>Not Knowing What the Mayor Looks Like, Squinting Their Old Eyes to Take a Look</h3>
<p>Most people in the countryside do not recognize Mayor Wu, but they have all heard of the mayor, and at least they know what a "mayor" is. When an old woman in a tea shop discovered "the mayor," she squinted her old eyes and looked all over Mayor Wu, as if she must dig out something different.</p>
<p>"Is that the mayor?" "Is he the biggest in the whole city?" Many villagers said in unison.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said that he loves the people in the countryside because only they are simple and honest. He loves the children in the countryside even more.</p>
<p>When Mayor Wu stepped into a bicycle shop in Jiangwan Town, the boss was out, and the shop was guarded by a village child. Mayor Wu stroked his head and asked:</p>
<p>"Little brother, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"Monk!"</p>
<p>Everyone was amused by this strange name. He said seriously:</p>
<p>"My name is Monk, that's what the master calls me."</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"Twelve years old"—</p>
<p>"Is business good?"</p>
<p>"So-so."</p>
<p>The twelve-year-old child was so nonchalant and mature, everyone laughed again.</p>
<p>Afterwards, District Chief Li Chengtang told Mayor Wu that the most difficult thing for the rural district office was the lack of cooperation between the military and the people. There were many troops stationed in the rural areas, and soldiers occupied residents' houses. The residents filed complaints with the district office every day. It is said that some troops often put a piece of paper on the door of the residents' houses, or even just write a few words with chalk, and they can forcibly move in. In addition, there are countless cases of borrowing beds, borrowing tables and chairs. Just yesterday, there was still a large pile of complaints from the people on the desk of the district office. The district office really felt powerless about this situation because they did not have this power.</p>
<h3>Magnificent and Grand Construction: A Postscript to Zhang Daqian's Art Exhibition - The Chinese Painting Gallery is Packed with Visitors, Eliciting Sounds of Astonishment and Praise Everywhere</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Zhang Daqian's art exhibition has concluded. The exhibition only lasted four short days, but its success was universally acknowledged. The Chinese Painting Gallery was packed with visitors, and sounds of astonishment and praise could be heard everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhang's paintings have reached the stage of "doing as he pleases, without overstepping the bounds." His landscapes are naturally vigorous and well-rounded, unmatched by any contemporary; his flower paintings also demonstrate supreme skill—the meticulous outlines are delicate and precise, and the "Ink Lotus" centerpiece is particularly magnificent and grand. I believe that one can see the artist's mastery of "still as a virgin, swift as a fleeing rabbit" in Zhang's flower paintings.</p>
<p>Directly Entering the Hall of Ancient Masters</p>
<p>However, Zhang's figure paintings are undoubtedly the most eye-catching. Zhang has been immersed in studying Dunhuang's precious paintings for many years, so it's no wonder he directly entered the hall of ancient masters. Just take a close look at the faces of Zhang's beauties, the folds of the clothing in his Buddhist images, and the kind of style in his portraits that makes you feel as if "their hair and beards are moving"—you can see the influence of Dunhuang on him.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhang's paintings with the eye of Western painting, one will immediately notice that the proportions of the limbs and torsos in Zhang's figures are relatively realistic, quite different from the slender shoulders and wasp waists of beauties in ordinary Chinese paintings, whose bodies are often deformed. In addition, I think the postures and facial expressions of Zhang's figures are also noteworthy: the figures under Zhang's brush seem to have flesh and blood; while the expressions of the figures in traditional Chinese paintings always remind us of the paintings of monks in medieval Europe. Zhang's studies from the Dunhuang murals indeed easily make us think of the classical movement of the Italian Renaissance. The masters of the Renaissance learned from the ancients, but completed entirely new techniques, thus achieving the most precious achievements in art history. I believe that if the art of Dunhuang can be widely disseminated, the result will certainly set off a magnificent wave in the history of modern Chinese art. Moreover, the impact may not be limited to painting alone—I think our literature, especially novels and epics, will certainly gain a richer and more fulfilling life because of this "new" blood.</p>
<p>Dedicated to Dunhuang Murals</p>
<p>Zhang Daqian is a person who is working hard in this direction. When I asked him when he would go to Dunhuang again, he stroked his mottled black and white beard and said excitedly that he would definitely go by the spring of next year at the latest. He has already copied about 120 mural paintings in Dunhuang (mostly works from the High Tang Dynasty), of which more than 80 have been completed, and the lines of about 40 more have not yet been drawn. Among these 120-plus paintings, the size of each corresponds to the original mural. The largest ones would probably require four or five rooms to accommodate. The lines are mostly first drawn precisely using tracing paper, and then redrawn on cloth. Of course, after so many years, the original colors on the murals will naturally inevitably peel off or fade. Zhang strives to restore the original colors in his copying. He has indeed spent a lot of effort in this "reconstruction" work.</p>
<p>He told me that the weather in Dunhuang is particularly dry, with no rain and very little snow. These things in the mountains have been preserved quite well thanks to the blessings of heaven. Ropes left in the caves thousands of years ago, originally used as railings to protect the murals, are still quite strong and won't break even when pulled by hand.</p>
<p>A Bewitching Demoness</p>
<p>I paid close attention to his painting "Bewitching Demoness" in the exhibition. The painting is about three feet high and depicts the Buddha in the middle, sitting solemnly. In front of him are three naked women using different poses to "bewitch" the Buddha. This subject matter is not particularly new, but I guessed at the time that it must have come from Dunhuang, because the lines of the three naked women are simply so accurate that they are close to the sketches in Western paintings, and are very different from the beauties under the brush of traditional Chinese painters. Later, I asked Zhang about the source of this painting. Sure enough, Zhang said that it was taken from a small part of a Tang painting he had copied. However, when it came to the Western influence in the Dunhuang murals, he flatly denied it. His point was that when Buddhism first came to China, it could be preached to the intellectual class through words or language, but to the lower-level ignorant men and women, it could only rely on pictures. And to preach, one must not be too shocking to the world, so even though it was clearly the Buddha of India, Chinese painters had to be asked to paint him in the image of a Chinese person. As for naked women, our country originally had them. There are many erotic and beautiful murals in Han tombs, so the presence of naked women in Dunhuang paintings does not necessarily prove that they were influenced by foreign countries.</p>
<p>However, even though Zhang said this, the question is probably still a question. Mr. Xiang Da, who is well-versed in the history of Sino-foreign exchanges, believes that Western influence is inevitable, because according to his research, Dunhuang was indeed a transportation hub for Sino-foreign exchanges in ancient times. Because of the mix of people from all directions, foreign influence in artistic works was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Both Xiang and Zhang stayed in Dunhuang for quite some time. Because of their different views, they have been arguing for quite some time. After they meet in Dunhuang next spring, will they continue to argue?</p>
<h3>Visiting Brigade Commander Comrade Xiao to Discuss Military-Civilian Harmony</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu is most concerned about the people's livelihood. He immediately wanted to meet Brigade Commander Xiao Zhaogeng of the 2nd Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, which is now stationed in Jiangwan, to discuss a proper solution.</p>
<p>Brigade Commander Xiao respectfully received Mayor Wu. After a brief exchange of greetings, he expressed disbelief that such a thing would happen. However, because they had just moved to Jiangwan, there were bound to be many things that were not on track and needed to be gradually corrected.</p>
<p>Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department offered a good solution. Director Zhang and Brigade Commander Xiao were originally classmates in the sixth term of the Whampoa Military Academy. He said: The Youth Army can send a few political workers to maintain regular contact with the district office! This can eliminate the separation between the military and civilians and prevent the occurrence of violations in the future. This is a good idea and was quickly accepted by the other party. Mayor Wu happily returned to the city government.</p>
<p>If Mayor Wu's inspection has played a role, Director Zhang's suggestions will be earnestly implemented, and military occupation of civilian houses will disappear completely in the future. Then, Jiangwan will have no winter, and the people of Jiangwan will always be warm.</p>
<h3>Powell's Legs Are Both Crippled</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] J.H. Powell, the publisher of the English-language "Millard's Review," testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Japan. After this, he suffered from heart problems and went to the United States for treatment. Unfortunately, his foot injury worsened. He had to have his right foot amputated on the 26th of this month, and his left foot cannot be preserved either. It will also have to be removed soon. Powell did not want to evacuate when the Pacific War broke out and was detained by the Japanese army in the Qiaotou Mansion concentration camp. Due to being severely abused, his legs were injured. After the victory, his toes had already been amputated, and now both legs are crippled.</p>

<h3>Low Credit of Negotiable Instruments Leads to Increasing Number of Bounced Checks - Banking Association Drafts Measures to Crack Down</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of bounced checks has been increasing in the mutual acceptance of negotiable instruments between the banking and money industries. An investigation of the bounced check records of the check exchange over the past year shows that both the number and amount of bounced checks have been increasing month by month. The number has increased by about 17 times, and the amount has increased by as much as 90 times, indicating that the credit of negotiable instruments is declining. This not only wastes manpower and material resources, but also has a significant impact on social finance. The Banking Association has drafted measures to crack down, as follows: 1. In addition to those who are already familiar, a client opening a checking account with a bank should have a guarantor approved by the bank. 2. If a client draws a check exceeding the deposit or overdraft limit, and the paying bank bounces the check, the paying bank should stamp the original check with a "Insufficient Funds" or "Overdraft Exceeded" stamp (the stamp should indicate the date) and issue a written warning. If the warning is ineffective and bounced checks continue to occur, and the bouncing bank believes that the client is intentionally doing so after three or more consecutive bounced checks, the account should be immediately suspended. At the same time, the account name, name, address, etc. should be reported to the association and sent to other associations for verification. 3. If a receiving bank discovers a client that meets the circumstances of the preceding article, it may also report it to the association for verification. 4. If a bank fails to implement the provisions of these measures effectively, resulting in an impact on the crackdown on bounced checks, the Banking Association, the Commercial Association, etc. will each impose sanctions.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Zhiguo Accompanied by Dancer Dong Ai'e: Smiling in Court - Boss of Henry's Accused of Adultery - Zhuang's Wife Liu Huiling Glared - Eloquently Stated the Evidence of the Defendant's Crime - Persuaded to Reconcile, but Refused to Give Up</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Zhuang Zhiguo, 23 years old, the boss of Henry's Watch Shop on Nanjing Road, had an affair with dancer Dong Ai'e (also known as Deng Senyun) in January of this year and cohabited with her in the Dahua Apartment. His wife, Liu Huiling, discovered the affair and was consumed by jealousy. She filed a lawsuit accusing Zhuang Zhiguo of adultery and Dong Ai'e of interfering with the family. Later, after mediation, an agreement was reached, Zhuang agreed to break off relations with Dong, and Liu Huiling withdrew the lawsuit. However, on September 30, Zhuang's wife discovered that her husband was still continuing to associate with Dong, and her jealousy intensified. She reported it to the police station, and Zhuang and Dong were detained and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor prosecuted them for interfering with the family. The case was tried yesterday in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court. Dong Ai'e appeared in court in a black leather coat and high-heeled leather shoes, still in the "dancer" style. Zhuang's wife wore a leopard-print coat and glared at Dong, still unable to contain her anger. Zhuang was smiling and at ease, as if he didn't know he was in court. Zhuang and Dong both denied continuing to have an affair, saying that they were just friends. Liu Huiling eloquently stated the evidence of Zhuang and Dong's adultery for half an hour. The court advised them to try to reconcile, but Zhuang's wife said that she had endured enough and asked the court to severely punish the defendants. After the lawyers for both sides argued, the court ordered a retrial at a later date, and the defendants were still released on bail.</p>

<h3>Anesthesia Case Coming to an End - The U.S. Side Orally Declares No Intention to Take Back - Guarantees that Similar Incidents Will Not Happen Again</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The blood plasma case and the anesthesia case are coming to an end. It is reported that the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee's response to the Chengxin Trading Company's suggestion was an oral declaration that it did not intend to take back the anesthetic drugs and surgical instruments, and guaranteed that similar blood plasma incidents would not happen again. As for the compensation for the blood plasma taken back, the U.S. side is still searching for it.</p>
<p>[Another Report] All 2,704 cases of blood plasma have been returned to the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee by the Chengxin Company and transferred to the U.S. Navy for temporary storage. They are currently stored in the U.S. Navy warehouse. To be cautious about this exchange procedure, the Chengxin Company and the U.S. Surplus Property Disposal Committee have a list of goods, which was given to the Chengxin Company the day before yesterday. Roger, the person in charge of the U.S. side, went to Okinawa Island yesterday to inspect the surplus materials there, so the final development of the blood plasma case is still pending Roger's return before it can be concluded.</p>
<h3>Fourth Day of Fire Prevention Publicity - Visiting Various Municipal Elementary Schools</h3>

<h3>Ships Without Permits Are Not Allowed to Carry Passengers - Customs Port Affairs Section Issues Notice</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] There are original regulations for ships carrying passengers. Ships without passenger seats are not allowed to carry passengers, that is, passenger ships are also restricted. Ships carrying passengers must register with the Customs Port Affairs Bureau in advance, and can only carry passengers after a certificate is issued. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Port Affairs Section slightly relaxed the restrictions due to special circumstances. Since the victory, the condition of ships has gradually recovered, and the Customs Port Affairs Section has strengthened its rectification. Port Director Yuan Jin recently issued a notice saying: "(omitted above) From now on, all ships that have not been issued passenger certificates by the competent authorities are not allowed to carry passengers without authorization. If there is any deliberate violation, once discovered, it will be severely punished, or even the ship will be detained. As for ships that have already obtained such certificates, if the number of passengers carried exceeds the quota, in addition to a heavy fine, the certificate may be revoked depending on the circumstances."</p>

<h3>British Trade Delegation to China Leaves Shanghai for Taiwan Today: Sir Paulson Reports to Reporters Before Departure and Expresses Optimism About the Future of Chinese Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The British Trade Delegation to China, led by Sir Paulson, comprising more than ten people, arrived in China on October 7th to investigate commerce and Sino-British trade. They visited Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places. Sir Paulson and his party left Beijing the night before after bidding farewell to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and came to Shanghai. Today, they will depart for Taiwan, stay in Guangzhou for a few days, and then return to England via Hong Kong. At 5:00 PM yesterday, Sir Paulson specially hosted reporters at the Qunmao Hotel, briefly outlining his observations from this investigation.</p>
<p>Sir Paulson stated: This investigation in China, touring various places, yielded a great deal of information. However, it must be fully organized and reported to the British government authorities before it can be made public. Currently, they have not made a final decision and must wait until January next year to finalize the results of the entire investigation, and report to the authorities in March. However, this investigation was divided into several small groups, which took turns visiting factories, mines, industrial areas, and commercial institutions. They were also deeply grateful for the warm hospitality and assistance provided by officials and business leaders from various places. He especially conveyed his gratitude on behalf of all members of the delegation.</p>
<p>Regarding the state of Chinese industry and commerce, Sir Paulson expressed: China has suffered extremely heavy losses during the eight years of the War of Resistance. Transportation is lacking, and one cannot expect much from the current state of industry and commerce, but the future of Chinese industry and commerce is definitely optimistic. The Chinese government authorities recently issued an order banning the import of certain types of foreign goods, which is not a common practice in other countries. However, the main reason for this is to balance China's imports and exports and stabilize economic policy. Fortunately, he heard that this ban is temporary and that there may be exceptions under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, China's current industry is still underdeveloped. We hope to help China build industry and balance imports and exports, importing more raw materials and fewer non-essential items. I (Sir Paulson said) could not find items I wanted to buy for my wife and children in England, but I could buy them in Shanghai. Luxury items should certainly be banned from import.</p>
<p>Among China's export products, soybeans are the largest category. According to the investigation, the number of soybeans awaiting export has increased two to three times compared to before the war. However, due to transportation difficulties, it has not been possible to export them in large quantities. On the British side, there is also a reluctance to sign trade agreements in advance without assurance, which delays delivery. If goods are to be delivered in six months, they must be delivered on time, otherwise, it is better to state it in advance to avoid losing credibility.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-British commercial treaty, Sir Paulson stated that it was not within the scope of his mission and he was not in a position to express an opinion. However, he said that the treaty does not only involve commercial matters and is currently being negotiated by the foreign ministries of the two countries.</p>

<h3>Textile Management Committee Decides That Cotton Yarn Pricing Will Not Change Until the US Cotton Purchase Issue is Resolved; Encouraging Private Spinning Mills to Purchase Domestic Cotton in Production Areas; Mills Buying One Bale of Domestic Cotton Will Be Allowed to Buy Three Bales of US Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The 13th meeting of the Textile Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was held at 3:00 PM yesterday at the City Hall Meeting Room. Wu Xisui, the chairman, Tuan Zhen, and committee members Dong Xijian, Wang Qizi, Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, Wang Yangxian, and Yang Xiren attended. Li Huopa, Liu Jingji, Wu Kunsheng, Pan Shihao, Rong Yixin, Guo Qiong, Xu Zixin, Wu Chengdao, Wang Bingdao, Wang Bingjun, Zhou Jiasheng, Shen Boqi, and Tang Zhiliang attended as observers. The meeting was presided over by Wu Jian, Chairman Guo Zhen. The discussion at the meeting was quite fierce, and it did not end until after 6:00 PM. The important proposals and resolutions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Proposal from the 6th District Cotton Spinning Association: (A) Please adjust the cotton yarn pricing as a whole. The reason is that the fixed price is not related to the current market, and the wages of raw cotton have changed significantly compared with the previous month. If it is not changed, the production yarn factories will be trapped. It is proposed to determine the increase and decrease of the price each month based on the negotiated price of the previous month and suggest an increase of 200,000 yuan based on the current price of 1.75 million yuan. Resolution: (1) Each yarn factory should report its production volume and cotton stock to the Textile Management Committee from today. (2) The negotiated price will not be changed temporarily until the US cotton purchase issue is resolved. The discussion will be held two weeks after each yarn factory reports its production volume and cotton stock. (B) Raw cotton should be purchased as soon as possible: It is now the cotton season, and domestic cotton has been launched. We should take the opportunity to find ways to purchase it. However, the production of domestic cotton has been insufficient in recent years and is only used for spinning coarse yarn. Therefore, most of the raw materials of each factory depend on US and Indian foreign cotton. Since the foreign exchange and restrictions, the source of foreign cotton has been cut off, and the stock of cotton is decreasing day by day. Therefore, we should plan for both to avoid production setbacks. Resolution: (1) Each private spinning mill will jointly organize a cotton purchasing institution to purchase cotton in cotton-producing areas such as Zhengzhou. (2) Each yarn factory that purchases one bale of domestic cotton will be allowed to buy three bales of US cotton. Those who buy more can infer from this ratio. (3) Regarding the purchase of US cotton, Mayor Wu will negotiate with President Song to determine the method. (C) The allocation and distribution of cotton warp should be determined: The distribution of yarn last month was in response to a temporary emergency, and its quantity and method had the disadvantage of cutting one's feet to fit the shoe. In addition to the allocation to consumers by manufacturers, there should be room for maneuver for insufficient or unsuitable allocation in foreign transportation and consumption. Resolution: (1) The distribution of 14,000 pieces of champion competition each month for the replication industry will continue temporarily in November. (2) In addition to those used for weaving by each yarn factory and those needed by each replication industry and retail yarn shops, they are allowed to be transported to other places for sale.</p>
<h3>Requests from the Replicated Goods Association: Approval of Yarn Count and Exemption of Advance Payment for Yarn</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Replicated Goods Industry Association's Yarn Allocation Committee's opinion on cotton yarn allocation certificates roughly stated that yesterday's Spinning Control Conference decided to implement a yarn allocation certificate system for the replicated goods industry. This was agreed to in principle at the Association's tenth committee meeting, but the following points should be considered for comprehensive consideration: (1) Yarn Count: Please investigate and approve the yarn count. Previous allocations of yarn were not entirely suitable for practical use, and each time the yarn count and quantity varied, making distribution difficult. It is requested to investigate and determine the existing equipment and past business conditions of the yarn factories, as well as the yarn counts they produce and the quantities. Refer to the yarn counts used by various replicated yarn factories, and separately approve the yarn counts they should be responsible for allocating. Compile statistics to facilitate mutual coordination and avoid repeated changes. Resolution: The Sixth Textile District Association shall compile a statistical list of produced yarn counts by next Monday. The Sixth Cotton Spinning District shall designate several individuals to conduct a survey of the allocation situation at various replicated factories, together with one member dispatched by this Association. (2) Please Specify Delivery Dates Separately: In the past, the Association experienced delays in delivery dates from yarn factories when receiving cotton yarn. This was due to the mismatch between the yarn factories' production volume and sales volume, resulting in unfinished products at the time of delivery. Accurate statistics should be compiled on the yarn factories' production capacity, and their delivery dates should be specified separately, so that recipients can go to pick up goods on a fixed date. Resolution: Passed in principle. (3) Exemption of Advance Payment: In the past, when paying for yarn, only a warehouse receipt was obtained, which had to be used to pick up the goods within ten days. However, delays occurred in reality, as already requested for transportation. Therefore, it is requested to exempt advance payment for future yarn allocations and instead change to paying and picking up goods at any time according to the previously mentioned delivery dates. Resolution: Interest should be refunded for delayed periods. If the factory refuses to refund, it can be reported to the Spinning Control Committee.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Must Notify Yarn Industry When Selling Surplus Yarn</h3>
<p>Regarding yarn merchants: (1) According to the above decision method, each factory shall sell half of the surplus yarn to ramp merchants, and the other half shall be supplied to old customers by the factory or handed over to the Yarn Industry Association for allocation. Factories that sell to old customers should issue a notice to the Yarn Industry Association. The Mayor also announced that starting tomorrow, if a form is not submitted, the Public Utilities Bureau will impose a power outage penalty on the factory for at least three days. (2) Maintain 1,500 pieces per month for the Yarn Industry Association to meet retail demand.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Distribution Organization</h3>
<p>Spinning Control Committee proposal: (1) The organization of the Investigation and Sales Committee was resolved at the Association's ninth meeting to be strengthened. The current distribution problem is extremely heavy. Please discuss and decide how to strengthen the Distribution Committee. Resolution: In the future, the Replicated Goods Industry Association can send two representatives and the Yarn Business Association can send one representative to attend meetings of the Distribution Committee.</p>
<h3>Approval to Spin 23-Count Yarn</h3>
<p>(3) According to the Sixth District Association, Hengtong, Guangqin, Chongxin, and other factories are spinning 23-count yarn. Please set the price at 10% higher than the standard price for 20-count yarn. At the Association's talk show on November 21, it was decided to first investigate whether the various replicated industries requested the allocation of 23-count yarn before discussing the price. Now, after reviewing the yarn application forms submitted by the various replicated industries, there is no request for the allocation of 23-count yarn. However, since the factories have this product, should the Sixth District Association's proposal to price the 20-count yarn at 10% higher be approved for record? Please discuss and decide. Resolution: Approved.</p>
<h3>Few Machinery Imports, Used Goods Fetch High Prices</h3>
<p>A foreign firm in the city stated that since the end of the war, there have been no imports of machinery used in civilian industries. The foreign machinery industry has not yet returned to normal after the war, so a large supply will still take some time. The various types of machines owned by various foreign firms in the city are also very few. Therefore, used machine parts are fetching higher and higher prices. Currently, a used 2-3 horsepower diesel engine requires about 3 million yuan per unit, and there is no definite price for higher horsepower power machines.</p>
<h3>Over 300 Silk Weaving Companies Apply for Loans</h3>
<p>The China and Communications Banks have recognized that silk weaving loans will begin on the 25th. As of yesterday, over 300 companies with 5,500 looms have applied. According to the methods approved by the Four Banks, only those with more than ten looms are eligible for loans from the China and Communications Banks. Those with fewer than ten looms should apply to the Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate. Therefore, those handled by the China and Communications Banks are manufacturers with more than ten looms, totaling 200 companies with 4,686 looms. The China Bank is handling 105 companies with 2,338 looms, and the Communications Bank is handling 95 companies with 2,348 looms. Yesterday, seven new companies, including Xinda, continued to apply. The China Bank is handling four companies, and the Communications Bank is handling three companies. The China and Communications Banks have dispatched personnel to investigate the number of looms reported by each factory, as many are inconsistent. If there are any falsehoods, loans will only be issued according to the actual number to prevent profiting from interest arbitrage.</p>
<h3>Fine Yarn Is Sold for 4.8 Million, Cotton Cloth Sales Are Strong, Leading to Increased Prices, and Next Month's Southern Shipping Quota Has Been Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market became even stronger, with 20-count yarn rising again by 2-3 million yuan. Although Ke Bang (客帮) [a type of merchant] made purchases, there were few sellers. The market was not dull, with limited-price trading of 32-count Yanghe single yarn and 10-count coarse yarn. 42-count double-stranded thread was in short supply in the current loan halls, and the asking price outside the market actually reached a huge 4.8 million.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market continued to rise, with strong demand from all sides. Serge grey cloth continued to rise by 2-3 thousand yuan, and dye plants in Shilin opened prices about 5,000 yuan higher. Yesterday's textile prices were also almost the same as the current market prices. For example, Jinlian Miaowu yuan serge, spot goods were 106,500 yuan, while textile construction opened at 105,000 yuan, only 1,500 yuan difference. Other flower drills and tribute cloths were stable.</p>
<p>The Spinning Control Committee approved the total amount of yarn and cloth to be shipped south from November, which amounted to 3,871 pieces of cotton yarn and 107,752 pieces of cotton cloth as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Fell Slightly, US Dollar Strong, Hong Kong Notes and Exchange Rate Rebounded</h3>
<p>Although yesterday's supply of gold was reduced, people's minds were still settled. The morning opened at 2,672,000 with requests, and there were more sales after work, once falling to around 2,665,000. Afterwards, it became stable and rose slightly. Supply and demand were silent, and buyers were doubly calm. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 50 taels at a price of 2,675,000. After being actually sold to offset the allocation, it once rose above 2,690,000 near noon before being pressured to fall back. At noon, it hovered between 2,675,000 and 2,680,000. In the afternoon, silver tightened due to the end of the month, forcing it downstream. It once retreated to 2,645,000 before slightly recovering, falling 20,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Ornamental gold hung lower to 280,000, patterned silver was flat, and silver dollars fell slightly. The interest rate on the black market overnight was flat and tight in the morning, rising to about 1.5 jiao (角).</p>
<p>Foreign currencies suddenly rebounded yesterday. The US dollar opened in the morning at 4,750 yuan to 4,800 yuan, and recovered to around 4,850 yuan at noon, struggling. In the afternoon, the gold market fell back slightly, falling back to around 4,800 yuan, slightly higher than the previous day. Hong Kong notes once rebounded to 970 yuan and slightly recovered in the afternoon. As a result, it closed 10 yuan higher than the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 935 yuan to 945 yuan due to the small number of telegrams from Shanghai and the influence of gold notes buying. Indian exchange rates were 1,135 yuan to 1,145 yuan, and Communist exchange rates were 15,100 yuan to 15,200 yuan. Transactions were still low, and the US exchange rate remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Gold Bars and Gold Coins Shipped from Mexico</h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank has made every effort to suppress rising gold prices, the rising trend has subsided. According to relevant sources, gold prices are lower in Mexico. After being shipped to the Far East, the profits are high. Huge amounts are shipped every day, divided into two types: gold bars and gold coins, each tael worth US$48.97.</p>
<h3>The Good Times for Chinese Stocks Are Not Lasting, the Third Period Delivery Begins, Short Sellers Hurry to Roll Over Positions, Market Prices Plunge and Still One-Sidedly Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the third period delivery of Chinese stocks began, and the shorts put on pressure as soon as they entered the market. The spot prices were very close, and the financial gangs were unable to arbitrage. Therefore, overnight floating long positions became sales, and they rose again. At the beginning of the morning market, there was a slight opening. After the opening, the shorts first put on pressure, and short necks rushed to roll over positions. Numbers 177, 106, 180, and 203 were all sold, and they immediately fell sharply. However, after the low, numbers 198, 185, and 199, etc., made up positions. After 10:15, they rebounded slightly. In the end, the shorts repeatedly rolled over positions, and numbers 12, 151, 186, 36, Min, etc., all sold. Xian Yong Yarn fell to 470 yuan. Around 10:30, there was a slight rebound, struggling for a long time. After 10:45, numbers 4, 155, and 162 came in, and Guang Bang (a trading group) continued to absorb, and people's hearts once turned better. The price was pulled up more than ten yuan within 470 yuan. In no time, there were sales when floating long positions met high prices, and the trend changed again. Numbers 157, 233, and 212 came to sell, and the decline was very rapid. Near noon, there was a lack of support, and the market almost universally cut long positions. People's hearts were extremely fragile, and once the decline started, it was unstoppable. Near the close, because the current delivery opened more than ten yuan, numbers 207, etc., finally intervened to arbitrage, so the price of 450 yuan for current Yong Yarn was temporarily maintained. The result was that Xian Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinnuo, and Xinguang Jingfu all fell by 10% compared with the previous closing price, Huafeng and Qinxing fell by 5%, and cold stocks such as matches fell by more than 10%. The rest fell slightly by 5% or less. In the afternoon, the trend was still one-sided, and number 186 continued to sell spot and delivered Yong Yarn. Supply exceeded demand, and after the arbitrage was squeezed out, the delivery finally deteriorated. In an instant, match number 142 was sold off urgently and the price was stopped from falling further. The delivery Xinnuo had a transaction at the price floor. Near the close, spot delivery turned up, while delivery continued to fall to a low price. The difference after closing was only 2-3 yuan. There was no profit to be made, and the distorted phenomenon was extreme. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Xinnuo all fell by 10% to 15%, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng fell by about 10%, the cold stock matches fell by 15%, Xin Ya Yong Gong fell by 10%, and Liyun opened only one transaction in the morning, which was slightly higher than before. The rest fell slightly by 5% or less. All stocks outside the market continued to show a downward trend.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to weaken yesterday, but there were not many transactions, and the decline was very small. The market situation was mediocre. As a result, compared with the previous close, shipping, shipping, steel, and paper were still flat, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Hovers</h3>
<p>Public debt rose and fell even more slightly yesterday, with only 3 million yuan traded. West Chamber of Commerce German-made entrusted 8th floor household had purchases, but large households in the industry like Lide had sales, and the situation did not escape hovering. Tongnei opened at 1,480 yuan in the morning, and the low price fell below 1,420 yuan. Finally, it hovered around 1,450 yuan. As a result, there was not much honor or disgrace compared with the previous close. Jia Yi rose slightly by 30 yuan, and Ding Wu were flat.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Turn Up, Grains and Oilcakes Are Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 11,000 piculs of rice arrived in the north and south. After days of sharp declines, production and sales were difficult to match. Therefore, the customer's heart turned firm, and both Cai Geng and Bei Geng rebounded by a thousand yuan. Xian rice also became active. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan were sluggish, and flour was also lifeless. Wheat bran was the most sluggish, and the price fell by 200-300 yuan, and there were few recipients. There were few wheat arrivals, and the market was strong. Yellow beans were sluggish and weak, falling another ten yuan. Although there were not many green beans arrivals, South Seas continued to adopt them, and the market situation was quite active. Sesame shops were not enthusiastic, and Guang Bang (a trading group) took slightly, and the shape was stable. Raw peanuts were depressed, falling by 1-2 thousand yuan. Bean cakes stood flat, and Ling beans could still be traded, sold as soon as they arrived, and the trend was mediocre. Red grain was still lacking in spirit. Oil prices rose and fell each other, one oil source increased, and the state of fatigue. Soybean was actively digested, rising by 1-2 thousand yuan. Sesame oil arrived in large quantities alone, especially in Hankou and Bengbu.</p>
<h3>Responsible Persons of Black Market Securities Firms Sign Guarantees</h3>
<p>Recently, the municipal police, social bureaus, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervision Office have spared no effort in cracking down on the black market for securities. Nine merchants operating off-exchange trading have now been discovered. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they summoned the responsible persons of each firm to come and sign guarantees. In addition to the responsible person of Wanlong Firm who did not arrive, there were Chen Hongqing of Hongqing Yong Firm, Shen Songlong of Taikang Heng Firm, Xu Yaoqiu of Xingchang Firm, Zheng Wuxun of Ce Feng Firm, Zou Zongmeng of Anli Firm, Wang Futian of Fukang Firm, Xu Lianjiang of Yuanchang Firm, and Lin Weizhong of Xie Xing Yong Firm, a total of eight people, arrived at the bureau. They confessed that they knew they were violating the law and asked for leniency. The authorities, considering that they were first-time offenders, ordered them to cease operations and separately signed guarantees that they would be subject to judicial punishment if they re-offended.</p>
<h3>Pigs Are Shipped in Steadily, and Meat Prices Gradually Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The price of fresh meat in the city has continued to rise. Mayor Wu once gathered Gu Ziyun, Zhu Zhigao, Ba Chunzhong, and others from the Fresh Meat Industry Association in Nancheng to jointly discuss ways to suppress meat prices. The municipal government also often gave special convenience to the industry association to investigate the pig production situation in Subei and the Siyang, Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Mingguang, Bengbu, and Xuzhou areas along the Jinpu Line and to dredge the sources. It is learned that the results of Gu's trip were very good. All pigs from Xuzhou, Mingguang, and Bengbu have recently been shipped in steadily. The wholesale price of fresh meat in the city is now trending down. However, the industry feels that it is already unsustainable due to the repeated increases in slaughter tax by the Finance Bureau. Mayor Wu has agreed to consider a solution.</p>
<h3>Lack of Bituminous Coal, Market Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The production and sales of bituminous coal in the city are strictly controlled by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Merchants are not allowed to freely extract and transport it. Since the beginning of winter, demand has increased sharply, and the Committee has failed to increase the allocation of goods, but instead has restricted the allocation of goods, resulting in the market supply failing to meet demand, causing abnormal panic and soaring market prices. The price of Kaiping No. 2 coal has reached 345,000 yuan per ton. White coal lumps and coke are at the peak sales season. Fortunately, the arrival of goods is continuous, and the market is relatively stable. Due to the lack of allocation of coal balls from Hongqi, the black market is 256,000 yuan per ton, and the retail market price has reached 12,000 yuan per load, and the quality has been greatly reduced compared to before.</p>
<h3>Few Transactions in Foreign Firms' Tea</h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, general cargo owners continue to come out, but the buying interest of various export firms is still limited, and only fine goods are taken. Therefore, there are few transactions. According to industry insiders, there is a need for colorless Pingshui (平水) big gangs sold to the Americas, but the selling price is too expensive and the given price is too hesitant. Therefore, the results of negotiations between supply and demand are still deadlocked. However, in order to actively promote tea sales, tea merchants in the city have sent telegrams overseas requesting price increases. As for the domestic sales of red edge tea, the store in the street is very short of sales, and customers from all roads are also hesitant. It is also heard that the tea market in Tianjin and other places has been declining recently. Therefore, it is not easy for people's hearts to be good, and the process is difficult to stand firm.</p>
<h3>Improving Silk, Please Amend the Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Regulations, Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Silkworm Seed Farms in Groups</h3>
<p>The Silkworm Silk Business Improvement Symposium, which was hosted by Zhongcan (中蠶) [China Silkworm] Consultant Xia Daoxiang and gathered representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the silkworm silk industry, lasted from 3:00 PM the day before yesterday until 6:00 PM yesterday. The main discussion was the amendment of the Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Regulations. The current Silkworm Manufacturing Regulations were promulgated in January of the 25th year, and many actual conditions have changed in more than ten years. It is believed that there is a need for revision and amendment. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has sent letters to solicit opinions from the competent authorities of various provinces and industry insiders in order to start the revision. After collecting materials, it was submitted to the authorities for approval. In addition, organize a silkworm seed manufacturing field investigation team and dispatch them in groups to conduct on-site investigations: (1) Grouping: two groups for 105 fields in Jiangsu Province, one group for 48 fields in Zhejiang Province, (2) Personnel: three people each from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Zhongcan, and China Agricultural Bank, one person from the Zhejiang Construction Department, and two people from the Jiangsu Construction Department, (3) Investigation items: 1. Building equipment, 2. Mulberry garden.</p>
<h3>Large Longans Rebound Tightly</h3>
<p>Large longans, recently because of the price of production and selling, the bank is largely unsold. Therefore, the asking price has rebounded tightly. The asking price of high-quality goods from the banks in the North and South cities yesterday rose by 120,000 yuan, gradually becoming a fixed trend.</p>
<h3>Post-War Cotton Consumption Increases, But Will Not Reach Pre-War Levels in the Next Two Years</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 27th] The Department of Agriculture said: According to the latest estimates, foreign cotton consumption was 10.1 million bales in 1944 and increased to 12.2 million bales in 1945. The world's commercial consumption in that year was 23.2 million bales. In Europe, France and Italy have increased compared to before. In the Far East, China and Japan have also increased greatly. Although India has decreased slightly, it is still larger than before the war. Except for India, the cotton consumption of any major country in Asia or Europe has not exceeded pre-war levels. It is expected that the total amount of foreign cotton consumption in 1946-47 will increase by about 3.5 million bales. The American cotton stored in China, Japan, Italy, France, and other countries in the past year will be exhausted in 1946-47.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Request Purchase, Sending Representatives to See Lin Fengbao</h3>
<p>In order to solve the current difficulties in the tea industry, tea merchant leaders in the city and important representatives from the tea production areas in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces plan to send representatives Zhu Jingwei, Sun Xiaocun, Tang Jiyu, and Jiang Zhenshi to visit Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, at 11:00 AM today to discuss solutions. The main issue is to request the government to purchase.</p>

<h3>President Wu Youxun of Central University Returns to School Next Month</h3>
<p>Returned to Native Place to Bury Ancestors</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing] Wu Youxun, President of National Central University, who was rumored to have resigned, graduated from Southeast University and studied abroad, and served as a professor at Tsinghua University. It is reported that after the victory, Wu smoothly progressed in Central University's reinstatement equipment, requesting funds to add and build school buildings, and there was no problem affecting his resignation. However, Wu is completely a scholar, often with a scholarly temper. He is subjective and does not want people to interfere in his personnel administration. Due to historical relationships, there are professors from the North and South, and their opinions may differ. Wu is a pure scholar with little administrative skills, or he may have developed the intention to resign due to temporary criticism from some professors. It is said that Wu has considerable relations with professors from both the North and South factions, which can be used to reconcile them, so that they will not become passive. After Wu left the school and returned to his native Jiangxi, there was much speculation outside. On the student side, because they shared weal and woe with President Wu in Chongqing and have not yet attended classes since reinstatement, they are deeply afraid that if the president is replaced and the person is not suitable, it will greatly affect their academic future. Therefore, the students' unanimous slogan is "Bring books to read," and the student union unanimously retained President Wu to return to school. Wu's departure from school this time to return to his native Nanchang was for the burial of his ancestors, not to resign. It was recently learned from Secretary General He of the school that President Wu had recently written a letter saying that he would come to Beijing next month. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has no intention of replacing the president of Central University.</p>

<p>顧毓琇局長暢談各國原子能現狀</p>
<p>Director Gu Yuxiu Discusses the Current State of Atomic Energy in Various Countries</p>
<p>After returning to China, Director Gu Yuxiu of the Shanghai Education Bureau spoke to reporters about the current state of atomic energy in various countries. He stated that European and American universities made significant contributions to national defense science during the war, and various research efforts are continuing after the war, especially atomic energy research, which has been very successful. The largest atomic energy laboratory in the United States is at the California Institute of Technology, headed by Professor Lawrence, a Nobel Prize winner. The world's largest atomic particle separator, weighing 40 tons and with a diameter of 184 meters, is housed in this laboratory. Recently, two Chinese professors have been assisting Lawrence in his work: Professor Ren Zhigong of Tsinghua University's Radio Department and Professor Zeng Zhaolun of Peking University's Chemistry Department. Furthermore, when the U.S. Navy conducted atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, Chinese professors Zhao Zhongyao and Wu Dayou were present to observe and gained much knowledge. The second largest facility after California is the Princeton Atomic Energy Laboratory. Lawrence hopes that China can send 30 students to be placed in atomic energy research laboratories at various American universities. Currently, England, France, and Switzerland have also achieved significant success in atomic energy research. European and American atomic energy experts, based on experimental results, have definitively discovered the possibility of applying atomic energy in construction, especially in medicine and physiology. Mr. Gu attended the centennial celebration of the Swiss Natural Science Society and participated in a conference where concrete decisions were made regarding future cooperation in scientific research among various countries.</p>

<p>32nd District Promotes Water Conservancy and Transportation: Taoshupu River to Be Dredged, Zhenjiang North Road to Be Repaired</p>
<p>The 32nd District (Zhenru) District Office believes that the Taoshupu River within its jurisdiction is not only an important waterway for navigation and a source of irrigation water for farmland, but also a source of drinking water for nearby residents. Recently, the river has become heavily silted, and the river water is foul and black, which seriously affects water conservancy and public health. The matter was reported to the Public Works Bureau for dredging. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau sent a surveying team to the district on the 25th of this month to conduct preliminary surveys. Dredging will begin as soon as the surveying work is completed.</p>
<p>[Further News] Zhenjiang North Road in Zhenru District is an important transportation route from Zhenru to Jiangqiao Town. Due to years of disrepair, the road is rough and uneven, and many of the bridges along the road have collapsed. District Chief Xia, local gentry Huang Yueyuan, and Chen Dayu, Principal of the East China Vocational School, initiated repairs and requested the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate 200 bags of flour for work-for-relief purposes, as well as 140 bags of cement for construction materials. The Public Works Bureau has also sent personnel to supervise the project, which is scheduled to begin on December 5th and is expected to be completed in about a month.</p>

<p>浙江漁民生涯</p>
<p>The Life of Zhejiang Fishermen</p>
<p>16th Dispatch: Chu Yusheng, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Hangzhou</p>
<p>In Zhejiang, among the 21,762,248 people, over 80% rely on agriculture for a living, and 5% depend on fishing. Calculating this 5%, there are over a million people who rely on handmade boats, handmade fishing nets, and their own labor to seek the traces of fish in the sea. Regarding the recent situation of the Zhejiang fishing industry, I have already reported in the article "On the Zhoushan Islands" on September 5th. Now, I will simply reflect on some aspects of their lives as a reference for those concerned about the fishing industry.</p>
<p>(1) Zhoushan Islands</p>
<p>The Zhoushan Islands should be the first to be mentioned among Zhejiang's major fishing grounds. Zhoushan Islands, entirely under the jurisdiction of Dinghai, consist of 185 islands. Among them, Daishan and Changtu Island are areas that produce large yellow croaker and small yellow croaker. Fishermen often come here during the spring and autumn seasons. The Shengsi Islands, under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province, are areas that produce hairtail. Fishermen gather here in winter. It is said that almost all the people on the Shengsi Islands are fishermen from Zhejiang. Therefore, some say that the Shengsi Islands should originally belong to Zhejiang, but were reluctantly assigned to Jiangsu Province because Jiangsu had no fishing grounds. We will leave aside the question of whether the Shengsi Islands should belong to Zhejiang, but it is undoubtedly true that the sea area south of Yantai in Korea and north of Taiwan is the home of Zhejiang fishermen.</p>
<p>These million fishermen are scattered across the Zhoushan and Shengsi Islands, with very few guarding their own fishing boats and drifting in the ocean. They are truly destitute. When the fishing season is about to arrive, they borrow money from their usual creditors or fishing companies. The interest rates charged by creditors are particularly high, exceeding 1.2% this spring. Although fishing companies claim to "not charge interest," they require fishermen to sell their catch at a discounted price when they harvest, which is no different from heavy exploitation. The fishermen borrow money with pain but repay their debts with blood and tears. This ancient tradition of honesty, simplicity, and generosity provides security for creditors and fishing companies. As long as they lend the money, they can sit back in their armchairs and wait for them to repay the money and fish.</p>
<p>(2) Heavy Burden on Fishermen</p>
<p>There are also some who use capital to build wooden boats specifically for renting to fishermen who do not even have broken boats. This spring, for three months, each boat required a rent of 70 Shi of rice. Estimating based on the price of 70,000 yuan per Shi of rice in Shenjiamen, this amounts to 5 million yuan for three months. When we inquired at a dried fish shop in Hangzhou, yellow croaker cost 2,000 yuan per Jin and hairtail cost 3,200 yuan per Jin. This means that 2,500 Jin of yellow croaker or 1,562.5 Jin of hairtail at Hangzhou's market price is needed to repay this 5 million yuan boat rent. However, Hangzhou is two and a half days away from the production area. After passing through fishing companies, resale to dried fish shops, transportation costs, and interest, the market price becomes 2,000 and 3,200 yuan per Jin. If sold directly to fishing companies at the production area, especially fishing companies that lend money to fishermen, the price is so depreciated that it is unimaginable. How many tens of millions of Jin would be needed to repay the entire debt for this season!</p>
<p>When the fishing season arrives, in the middle of the night or at dawn, when the fog is thick, they must wake up their fellow boatmates and force them to open their drowsy, tired eyes. On the vast, boundless ocean, children call out to their parents, the old care for the young, and they pass on the experience they have gained through years of groping around. If one is not careful, the boat hits a reef, or the wind is too strong, the waves are too fierce, and the rudder is unstable. Those who know how to swim quickly tell everyone on the boat to crouch down. If it capsizes, everyone on the boat drowns in the ocean, and the rolling waves send them to places they have never been. Struggle! Eventually, they are devoured by the fish they originally wanted to catch. The creditors still inquire about their families and even demand that the families repay the debts.</p>
<p>(3) Worship of Gods</p>
<p>Fishermen seem to have no right to read books. Therefore, many are illiterate. They do not know that the times are progressing. They do not know how to protect their own lives. They do not know how to reduce their burden to enjoy legitimate rights? They only know to use the simple fishing gear passed down for thousands of years and the habits and experience passed down for thousands of years to fish, fish! From birth to death, they live by fishing! Everything is entrusted to fate, everything is entrusted to nature. As a result, they are particularly superstitious and their lives are particularly romantic. The most worshiped Bodhisattvas among them are the West Mother Goddess and the Erlang Bodhisattva. According to legend, a long time ago, an old fisherman encountered danger at sea and drifted to a small island. The island was desolate, but there was only one temple. Inside the temple was a female Bodhisattva. The old fisherman had no food for several days on the island, but the Bodhisattva's offering table was supplied with fresh bread and other items every day. Therefore, almost every island in Zhejiang has a West Mother Goddess Temple (the legend of the Erlang Temple is similar). During the peak fishing seasons in spring, autumn, and winter, the West Mother Goddess Temple and Erlang Temple are filled with incense. The romantic aspects of the fishermen's lives are also fully exposed at this time. They seem to believe that "there is only today, no tomorrow"; so they indulge in pleasure, drinking until they are completely drunk, gambling until they are penniless, and engaging in prostitution and entertainment, stopping at nothing. They do not think about waiting until they have no money to want money. They fundamentally believe that "money is an external possession" and that "poverty is destined," so when they are penniless and poor, they entrust everything to the will of the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>(4) Improving Lives</p>
<p>This spring, the fishing catch was too poor. They said: "This is because the people who made vows to the Bodhisattva last year did not fulfill them enough." Therefore, in early summer, the incense at the West Mother Goddess Temple and Erlang Temple was even more abundant. Some even borrowed high-interest loans to "fulfill their vows."</p>
<p>In fact, the quality of the fishing catch can also be known in advance. Just investigate the ocean currents, water temperature, specific gravity, salinity, water color, transparency, and biological content. It's just that our government in the past did not bother to pay attention to these things, and the creditors and fishing company owners who made money from the fishermen did not think about the shame of gaining without labor.</p>
<p>Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has paid attention to these issues, but the problems that exist among the fishermen are still maritime security and high-interest exploitation, the inability to freely buy and sell, and so on. Although Zhejiang Province has been trying to borrow six landing craft in Shanghai, landing craft have flat bottoms and are not suitable for the open sea. Fishing boats drift for hundreds of miles, and landing craft cannot protect them. Although the Agricultural Bank of China and the Zhejiang Provincial Local Bank have already provided loans, the Agricultural Bank only allocated 100 million yuan in loans to Wenzhou and Yuhuan, and the Local Bank only lent 20 million yuan to Wanghuan and 30 million yuan to Xiangshan. However, the main island of the Zhoushan Islands, Dinghai, which has the most fishermen in the top-tier fishing grounds, has not received any loans. The timber for old-style fishing boats to supplement losses from the United Relief Association will not arrive until next year. Although the government has been trying to ban fishing companies and establish fish markets to allow free buying and selling, the power of the fish market ultimately cannot defeat the fishing companies.</p>
<p>Based on the above account of the actual lives of fishermen and a review of the current facilities for alleviating their suffering, we feel that we must step up our efforts. Today, the fishermen's problem is not only a political problem, but requires the combined efforts of all scientists and economists to thoroughly solve it. Otherwise, the lives of fishermen will never improve. If the lives of fishermen cannot be improved, they will only regress. Because the lives of fishermen cannot be improved, fish production will decline, causing the good fishing ports in the East China Sea to be eliminated.</p>
<p>漁業二三事</p>
<p>Two or Three Things About the Fishing Industry</p>
<p>Su</p>
<p>The fishing industry is one of China's important production industries. Broadly speaking, it includes the capture, processing, and aquaculture of aquatic products, as well as other related departments. Therefore, it is also known as the aquatic product industry. This industry has been valued by entrepreneurs in the current process of economic construction, and the 1 billion yuan in fishing loans released by the China Farmers' Bank this time, although small, is enough to encourage fishermen along the coast to form fishing cooperatives as soon as possible. This article will provide a bird's-eye view of the recent state of the fishing industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, for the reference of domestic people.</p>
<p>集會紀盛</p>
<p>Meeting Highlights</p>
<p>The center of the fishing industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is indeed in Dinghai, Zhejiang's ocean waters, so the description should start from Zhejiang. The opening of the Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou Fisheries Construction Conference has been even more vigorous. At 9:00 AM on the 20th, the Ningbo Sixth District Commissioner's Office organized the meeting. Participants included Wu Xianzhang and Shao Zonggao, representatives of the Agricultural Bank of China, as well as Yu Jimin, Commissioner of the Sixth District, Chen Youhua, County Magistrate of Yin County, Ge Yanlin, County Magistrate of Zhenhai County, Zhou Lingjun, County Magistrate of Fenghua County, Zhu Muzhi, County Magistrate of Dinghai County, Li Jie, County Magistrate of Ninghai County, Meng Zhu, County Magistrate of Xiangshan County (represented by Xu Huanwen), Mao Xianyou, representative of the seven district cooperatives, Jin Jifu, representative of the fisheries association, Rao Yongbi, Director of the Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau, Ye Mei, Director of the Cooperative Management Office of the Construction Department, Le Jishi, representative of the National Fisheries Company Joint Office, Yu Fengyuan and Chen Yuetao, Commissioners of the Sixth District, Li Xingjie and Hu Guomen of the Ningbo Fish Market, Shi Jinchun of the Yin County Fisheries Association, Xie Baoyou of the Yin County Cooperative, Shi Qinghua and Cao Shihao of the Dongqian Lake Cooperative, Xue Guosheng of the Ninghai County Fisheries Association, Lin Xiuting and Shen Dechang of the Fenghua County Fisheries Association, Lin Shangliao of the Tongjiao Cooperative, Wang Shisun and Hu Jiabin of the Hongxi Cooperative, Shen Tianyuan of the Qifeng Cooperative, Xu Huanwen of the Xiangshan County Fisheries Association and Shibu Cooperative, Chen Yuan of the Nanjiushan Cooperative, Miao Bangyong of the Dinghai County Fisheries Association, Ma Longtu and Ding Xiaomei of the First Cooperative, Cao Xinfu of the Shenjiamen Cooperative, Wang Xiguang of the Zhenhai Fisheries Association, Zhu Zubian, Jin Ligang, and Dai Wenxian of the Daxi Cooperative, Zhao Cisheng, Wu Bifeng, Hu Dewen, and He Zhizhen of the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association, and Lin Ke and Wu Ge, representatives of Ningbo, Shen Yu and Bao Maorong of the Ningbo Branch, and Feng Zikang, representative of Dinghai, totaling 48 people. At this grand meeting, although some representatives were fishermen, they were dressed smartly when they joined the meeting and mingled with local officials and bankers.</p>
<p>漁貸貧配</p>
<p>Distribution of Fishing Loans</p>
<p>Fishing loans are allocated to fishing cooperatives in the fishing areas of Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, in proportion to the number of fishermen employed and the number of fishing boats in each area. Ningbo accounts for 55%, Wenzhou accounts for 25%, and Taizhou accounts for 20%. The guarantee procedures and repayment methods have been determined as follows: A. Guarantees from cooperative members to the cooperative: (1) Joint guarantee of fishing gear, (2) Guarantee from merchants and shops, (3) Fishing catch and assets of cooperative members, (4) Mortgage of fishing boats and fishing gear. B. Guarantee from the cooperative to the bank, guaranteed by the local county government. Secondly, personnel should be dispatched to supervise the issuance of fishing loans. The methods are as follows: (1) Personnel dispatched by the guarantors of each county should supervise at any time, (2) The Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association and the Provincial Cooperative should jointly send personnel to check whether the fishing loans are issued to fishermen who have joined the cooperative, (3) The cooperative that obtains the fishing loan should first prepare three copies of the list of members who have joined the cooperative, one copy should be sent to the guaranteeing county government, one copy should be sent to the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association, and one copy should be sent to the local Agricultural Bank of China for reference. If there are additional members, the list of members who have joined the cooperative should be submitted within one week of joining, and the date of joining and other items should be filled in, (4) Each cooperative should prepare a certain number of shares to participate in the fish market in each place as share capital. The Provincial Cooperative will send personnel to be stationed in each fish market to monitor the use of fishermen's loans and may appropriately提成(ti cheng, not in dictionary, likely a kind of commission) to encourage savings. The distribution of this 1 billion yuan in loans is entirely managed by the Provincial Joint Cooperative, which is responsible for organizing the Aquatic Products Association, and the amount of loans was also voted on at the meeting. Dinghai in Ningbo received the most loans, at 150 million yuan, followed by Fenghua at 135 million yuan and Xiangshan at 95 million yuan. The number of loans in Linhai, Wenling, and Sandou in Taizhou is also not small. Since no representative from Wenzhou attended, the allocation number should be determined separately by the area.</p>
<p>劃分漁場</p>
<p>Demarcation of Fishing Grounds</p>
<p>The conference suggested that the government should quickly demarcate the boundaries of inshore and offshore fishing grounds to avoid disputes. The so-called inshore fishing grounds focus on the sea area within 200 meters of the coast. According to the discussion of general scholars, this important area is also called the "sea fence." Because it is close to the shore, the depth is not great, and from the sea surface to the seabed, it is greatly affected by sea currents, tides, and waves. Sunlight can also penetrate to a considerable extent, and water temperature and specific gravity change appropriately. Moreover, the materials washed in by rivers from the land are very rich, which is very conducive to the breeding of plankton and various aquatic animals. The value of inshore fishing grounds should be based on this kind of sea fence area as its scope. However, in the deep sea, there are also occasional shallow areas within 200 meters. This kind of land standing in the deep sea is the best fishing ground. Just like the plateau on land, its difference in water depth from the surrounding deep sea is great, then the fishing ground is better. Because the sea current collides with this land, it becomes an rising current, which stirs up the water and changes the tune. For migratory fish, it can often make their fish groups inhabit here, which is very convenient for fishing. The next discussion focused on how to assist in the construction of Nanjiushan and how to prosper Changtu Port. The proposers will allocate detailed methods. Then the discussion turned to the restoration of Zhejiang Aquatic Products School and how to raise the school's funds. It was decided that the association should send people to Dinghai to conduct a clear investigation before discussing it further. The proposal turned to the issue of protecting fishermen. In addition to fishermen enriching their self-defense forces, the government was requested to allocate a 100-ton to 200-ton diesel steel-hulled ship as a fishing protection ship, and the government should supply military uniforms, weapons, and ammunition. However, the fishing protection funds should not be used from fishermen, and the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association and the Provincial Fisheries Union will raise them.</p>
<p>帶魚汎期</p>
<p>Hairtail Fishing Season</p>
<p>Fish production along the coast of our country is available in all four seasons of the year, and it is inexhaustible and inexhaustible. Among them, there is only a slight difference between the peak and off-season of fishing. Now it is winter, which is the hairtail fishing season, and the fishing area is biased towards the Shengsi Islands and Sheshan waters in Jiangsu Province. Shengshan, the gathering place of fishing boats, is worth mentioning. Shengshan has a very small area, not as large as Hong Kong. Its position is outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, southeast of Huabiao Island. The island is full of mountains, with the highest peak 700 feet above sea level, but there are few trees. Although it looks verdant at a glance, when you are on the ground, you only see barren smoke and weeds, and strange rocks. The island's fish production, yellow croaker in spring and black seabream in summer, is already huge in number, but hairtail is the top. The estimated value reaches more than 100 billion yuan. This kind of hairtail has a narrow and long body like a belt, a completely silver-white color, and sharp teeth. Every winter, it migrates from north to south and begins to be caught on Xiaoxue Jie (Minor Snow Solar Term), (November 22nd). Although there are no less than 10,000 fishing boats, 85% come from the fishing areas of Zhejiang Province. Therefore, Zhao Cisheng, Supervisor of the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Construction Association, sent representative Lin Ke to Shengshan in the name of Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Co., Ltd. to supervise this year's hairtail fishing season and crack down on bad fish companies, because the biggest pain for fishermen is being defrauded by fish companies, and high-interest loans are the second biggest. The most noteworthy thing is the actions of pirates. Pan Zhaocai, a huge bandit who has been entrenched on the island for many years, sells flags (small triangular flags with a white "Pan" character on a red background) and cards (i.e., Pan bandit's business cards with a small photo of Pan bandit) to support the bandits. There are about 200 rifles and pistols and 7 light and heavy machine guns. Although the provincial government has taken measures to appease them, they have not complied with the order. At present, the pacification agency has drafted appropriate measures to eliminate pirates. However, Pan bandit uses Shengshan as his lair, widely sets up concubines, and enjoys luxury, just like a local emperor. It is really difficult to make him turn over a new leaf. Only his secretary, Ke Ruiliang, who has a little literacy, still has insight and has made a small contribution to the creation of education and improving the intellectual level of fishermen, especially by suppressing the fish companies' use of scales, changing the 18-tael scales to provincial municipal scales, which has won the hearts of the fishermen.</p>

<p>國產三輪汽車試車成功</p>
<p>Domestic Three-Wheeled Vehicle Successfully Tested</p>
<p>8th Dispatch: Li Shaolin, Reporter for this Newspaper in Tianjin</p>
<p>The successful manufacturing of three-wheeled vehicles by the Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant, which belongs to the Pingjin District Automotive Repair and Parts General Factory of the Ministry of Communications, is tantamount to the nascent sound of China's automotive industry. This successful experiment has inspired all the engineers in their plant, and the work enthusiasm of more than 400 technicians has also been enthusiastically encouraged. The Pingjin District Automotive Repair and Parts General Factory is composed of the former North China Automotive Industry Co., Ltd. and Yifeng Rubber Factory and Fuji Battery Factory, etc. In Tianjin, it has two directly affiliated factories, one is the Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant, and the other is the Tianjin Automotive Repair Factory. The successful manufacturing of three-wheeled vehicles is the achievement of the Manufacturing Plant. The person in charge is thinking that, after a period of time, they will be able to further manufacture general large passenger vehicles, so that there will be domestically produced passenger vehicles running on highways across the country.</p>
<p>初步設計</p>
<p>Preliminary Design</p>
<p>The design of the three-wheeled vehicle began in February of this year. Under the joint research of Director Huang Zhi of the Manufacturing Plant and more than 20 engineers, they referred to the equipment capacity of the Manufacturing Plant, the actual needs, and the advantages and disadvantages of various models. First, it was decided that the ideal three-wheeled vehicle should use a single-cylinder air-cooled type, and then the Japanese Daisetsu brand three-wheeled vehicle would be used as a blueprint to start drawing and manufacturing. The manufacturing work actually started in March. Some technical difficulties and work obstacles were resolved with continuous efforts. So, at the end of May, the first domestically produced three-wheeled vehicle, unprecedented in China, was assembled and left the factory and drove on the road. By the end of August, nine more vehicles had been completed one after another. Among these ten completed three-wheeled vehicles, there are seven canopy vehicles, one jeep, one truck, and one chassis vehicle. The Manufacturing Plant plans to manufacture 50 vehicles by the end of January next year. The assumed production volume is one vehicle per day from January to March next year, three vehicles per day from April to July, and after August, all equipment will be used to its maximum capacity, and five vehicles can be manufactured every day.</p>
<p>全部自製</p>
<p>All Domestically Produced</p>
<p>These three-wheeled vehicles, in addition to the magnetos, transformers, and other minority electrical materials on the vehicles, all the required 1,102 parts are manufactured by the Manufacturing Plant itself. Each part has to go through three or several or more than a dozen procedures. A total of more than 10,000 procedures are required to complete the required parts, plus assembly. The assembled sedan weighs 800 kilograms, the canopy vehicle weighs 770 kilograms, and the jeep-style vehicle weighs 650 kilograms. Each vehicle can carry three to five passengers. The truck weighs 680 kilograms and has a load capacity of 650 kilograms. The chassis vehicle weighs 485 kilograms and has a load capacity of 750 kilograms. The three-wheeled vehicle has a horsepower of 7.5, and a road 1.3 meters wide is sufficient for driving, and a road 4.8 meters wide can turn around at one time, because its minimum turning radius is only 2,400 mm. The fuel tank on the vehicle can hold three gallons of gasoline, and the oil tank can hold one gallon of lubricating oil. The maximum speed is 50 kilometers per hour, and each gallon of gasoline can be used for 40 kilometers. Recently, the factory accepted the price for customization. The canopy vehicle is 4.5 million yuan, the jeep-style vehicle is 4 million yuan, the truck is 3.6 million yuan, and the chassis vehicle is 3.2 million yuan. This kind of three-wheeled vehicle is not only suitable for transportation in urban areas, but can also be an ideal means of transportation for short-distance transportation in rural areas.</p>
<p>公開試車</p>
<p>Public Test Drive</p>
<p>On September 28, the Pingjin District Automotive Repair and Parts General Factory used these ten first batch of domestically produced three-wheeled vehicles to conduct their first public test drive in a convoy in Tianjin. They circled around a week in the bustling city of Tianjin. When these vehicles were running on the road, pedestrians looked at them with surprised eyes. In particular, the red cloth signs hanging on the vehicles, "Domestically Produced Three-Wheeled Vehicle," attracted more attention. This initial achievement in the national industry has obviously attracted the attention of society. The orders for these vehicles from the Northeast and Shanghai and other places show its own value. The form of the three-wheeled truck is the same as that of a large car. After the streamlined front, there is an iron-clad cargo bucket. The sedan-style passenger car is streamlined from head to tail, with two rows of seats inside. The back row is a long leather chair that can seat three people, and the front row is two small leather chairs, which are divided under the left and right car windows in the car. The canvas top of the canopy vehicle can be easily installed or lowered. Being light and flexible should be a unique advantage of this vehicle. In addition, thanks to the installation of the muffler, it does not have the deafening noise of a typical motorcycle after starting.</p>
<p>工廠內部</p>
<p>Inside the Factory</p>
<p>The Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant, which manufactures three-wheeled vehicles, includes six factories. The first factory is metallurgy. All work such as alloy smelting, sand turning, and casting belongs to the metallurgy factory. The second factory is machinery. All work such as drilling and planing of various machine parts belongs to the machinery factory. The third factory is electrical, and all electrical machine parts that can be manufactured by themselves are completed by the electrical factory. The fourth factory is sheet metal. All iron plates and iron sheets required for assembling the car body and car box belong to the sheet metal. The fifth factory is carpentry, which is responsible for manufacturing all the necessary wood installations on the car. The sixth rubber factory is responsible for manufacturing inner and outer tires and various rubber parts. The Manufacturing Plant now has more than 400 workers, more than 20 engineers and technicians. To enable mass production of three-wheeled vehicles, they need to increase the number of workers</p>

<p>Free Talk: Brawl by Young Husband</p>
<p>The efforts of the authorities to rectify traffic in recent months have been witnessed by all citizens of the city, and everyone is genuinely admired and respected. However, there are some practical difficulties, such as narrow streets, poorly maintained roads, too many vehicles, and insufficient traffic police personnel, etc., which limit the effectiveness to some extent.</p>
<p>Analyzing these difficulties, they are nothing more than a matter of money, manpower, and time. We also know that the municipal authorities are determined, willing to work, and have many experts to assist them. In the near future, we believe that these difficulties can be overcome and resolved one by one.</p>
<p>However, why are man-made hindrances constantly emerging? If we are allowed to say something harsh, it is simply satirizing the efforts of the authorities, or saying that it is a joke.</p>
<p>There are too many examples of these obstructions to traffic. For example, the brawl between the driver of the No. 3 bus and the traffic police the day before yesterday. Both are affiliated with the municipal government and are traffic workers. It is too disrespectful to the citizens of Shanghai for such an incident to occur, disrupting traffic for as long as two hours. I believe the municipal authorities should take responsibility for this case. If this trend continues, the actions of us ordinary people will depend on the whims of others. What kind of city will this be?</p>
<p>The transportation company has its own explanation, and the police bureau has its own explanation. In short, they are all ignorant of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The virtuous and hardworking mayor has been going deep into the community for days, seeking out the people's concerns. Yesterday, he even braved the wind and rain to go to Jiangwan. Can he give a fair punishment to this case!</p>
<h3>Second World War Secrets: Atomic Bomb Nearly Exploited by Nazis 1</h3>
<p>Translated by Lan Ning from the November "Reader's Digest"</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: Readers may have heard about the story of how the atomic bomb was nearly exploited by the Nazis, but most of them are not detailed. Here is a translation of the record of the sabotage of the Nazi atomic bomb production from this month's "Reader's Digest." The original article was published in the American "Minneapolis" Tribune and was written by F. Sanden. This is a relatively detailed and complete report.)</p>
<p>One morning in February 1944, the heavily loaded railway ferry "Hydro" was breaking waves in Lake Tinn in Norway. Suddenly – a thunderous roar erupted from the lower deck. The ship suddenly tilted, shaking and stopping. Five minutes later, the "Hydro" sank to the bottom of the lake, taking with it Hitler's dream of completing the first atomic bomb. Behind this explosion lies the most shocking and tense story of this war, which could have affected the fate of all mankind.</p>
<p>Information</p>
<p>As early as April 1940, the international scientific community already knew that the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was conducting large-scale atomic fission experiments. After the establishment of the Manhattan Project (Note) in the United States in 1942, the British Ministry of Economic Warfare received shocking intelligence: the Germans ordered Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian electrochemical plant (the largest in the world), to increase its production of heavy water from 3,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds a year. This can only mean one thing. Allied physicists discovered that heavy water is an ideal "moderator" for the production of potassium-235. Because the Allies did not have enough heavy water, and it would take another year and a half to refine it, they finally used black chalk as a substitute. However, British intelligence confirmed that the German Kaiser Institute's experiments far exceeded those of the Allies. Sabotaging Norsk Hydro and destroying the heavy water stockpile there immediately became the British War Cabinet's top priority. The Air Force Staff said that it would be impractical to bomb this needle-sized target surrounded by towering mountains with all the planes available at the time. This was a commando mission.</p>
<p>A little earlier, several Norwegian resistance members had seized a coastal steamer, the Garsan, and sailed through the mine- and submarine-infested North Sea to Aberdeen, England. One of them was a hydroelectric expert who had organized an underground resistance group in Norway, named Einor.</p>
<p>He was immediately summoned to the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive in London. This strong and alert engineer was proficient in skiing and shooting – ideally suited for the current mission. He was extremely calm and decisive. Even better, he had lived within a few miles of the Norsk Hydro plant. His brothers and friends had considerable status there.</p>
<p>At the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive, Einor met Dr. Transda, who had been the design engineer of the Norsk Hydro heavy water plant. This doctor was the one who developed large-scale heavy water production. Before the war, he was friends with many German nuclear physicists, so he was one of the non-Germans who knew the most about the German "atomic bomb" program at the time. At the end of 1941, Transda escaped to Sweden and flew to London.</p>
<p>Sabotage</p>
<p>Einor asked Transda: "In your opinion, can Norsk Hydro be sabotaged to the point where it can no longer continue production?" According to the doctor's explanation, the factory was a seven-story, strongly constructed permanent mud-steel skeleton building. It and nearly ten adjacent equally strong hydroelectric plants were perched on a cliff in a thousand-foot-deep valley. All access roads and the factory were guarded by carefully selected German troops. The surrounding steep mountains were almost impassable. This was indeed a difficult task. "But, of course, we are willing to try," he said.</p>
<p>Einor was immediately sent to a Special Operations training camp. He quickly learned how to use shortwave transceivers, codes, parachuting, and so on. Then he received his final instructions. He was ordered to return to Norway immediately, collect every piece of information about Norsk Hydro, transmit it to London, and await the arrival of reinforcements.</p>
<p>One moonlit night, Einor jumped from a British bomber and landed straight down into the Norwegian mountains twenty miles from his home. Before sunrise, he had skied safely home and had breakfast with his mother. "I'm on a skiing trip," he told his family. He was quite worried for the first few days, but clearly no one knew that he was related to the Garsan incident. (To be continued)</p>
<p>(Note: The Manhattan Project is another name for the United States' massive atomic bomb production program.)</p>
<p>Miraculous Skill by Cai Lin</p>
<p>Marshall once experienced the slight skill of the Chinese "Robin Hood" at the Nanjing Railway Station, and a "horse theft" case occurred. Marshall expressed surprise at this.</p>
<p>In the past, a detective captain in Suzhou asked a pickpocket: "Can you pick the watch out of my pocket?" The pickpocket said, "Of course I can. Just pass through Shantang Street (where there is a very lively vegetable market in the morning) at about nine o'clock tomorrow morning." The captain let the pickpocket go. The next morning, he passed through Shantang Street, and the watch in the pocket of his uniform really disappeared without him knowing it..."</p>
<p>"Dead people need to keep an eye on the three coffin boards," this is the cold words of those who have never encountered a pickpocket.</p>
<p>Recently, the police局 has been working hard to eliminate pickpockets, but the day before yesterday, I encountered such a thing; I bought two train tickets and had 30,000 yuan more. For safety's sake, I bundled the 30,000 yuan in three stacks with a rubber band, and tucked the two train tickets on top of the banknotes held by the rubber band, and then hid them in the pocket of my coat. Then I buttoned the button on the pocket.</p>
<p>The passengers on the No. 3 bus were so crowded that the car was almost about to break apart. I was squeezed on the bus for less than twenty minutes. When I got off the bus, I found that the button on the pocket inside my coat was unbuttoned. When I reached in, I broke out in a cold sweat. The loss of the money was a small matter, but the two train tickets were for sleeper berths. Losing them meant that I couldn't buy replacements, which was no small matter.</p>
<p>After searching in my pocket, I found a rubber band and two train tickets. The money was gone.</p>
<p>I can only thank such a righteous thief, and I believe that his powers are vast. There is a difference between the hand伸出 from the coffin and him.</p>
<p>Transformation: Jeep Becomes Tiger, Gold Becomes Dirt by Xiao Nan</p>
<p>There are many kinds of transformations: turning an orange north of the Huai River into a trifoliate orange south of the river is a change in form; seeming one thing but being another is a change in nature; as for the "different ingenious tricks" of magicians, that is a transformation in theater.</p>
<p>No matter what, in China, it can be completely changed beyond recognition: dancing, which is originally a normal social activity, is transformed into a licentious and immoral game; the jeep of the "omnipotent doctor" is transformed into a troublemaker that runs wild; air transport, which is convenient for transportation, can be transformed into the best tool for smuggling; even receiving can be transformed into "robbery"; gold bricks are transformed into "copper blocks"; gold is transformed into "dirt"; traitors are transformed into "judges"; complete machines are transformed into scrap metal; all kinds of perversions are truly amazing!</p>
<p>"Poverty leads to change, change leads to prosperity." China is a poor country, so there are many changeable phenomena. All changes are for the sake of money! And with financial resources, there is nothing that cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>"The superior man changes like a leopard, his spots becoming brilliant." The "man" of the superior man is transformed into the "leopard" of the wild beast. From the outside, it still looks like "his spots becoming brilliant", and it does not feel fierce and terrible. This is the best kind of "change". Only in our "land of culture and civilization" can we find it.</p>
<p>China, which is so changeable, how many tricks are left to change? And how far will it change?</p>
<p>Mixed Praise and Criticism by Guang Chun</p>
<p>A certain evening newspaper reported that Brigadier General George, the former head of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Materials Liquidation Committee's Shanghai Branch, had a constant stream of corruption cases during his tenure. Since his dismissal, it is said that the Materials Supply Bureau of the ××院 has often been in contact with George in his work, and has been hesitant to give him a "commendation", and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to transfer to the National Government to issue a certain medal of the Republic of China. This matter was told to a reporter by an American businessman, who said after speaking: "I don't know if the medals that your country gives to foreigners are divided into two types, praise and criticism."</p>
<p>The author would like to explain that the division of Chinese medals into two types, praise and criticism, is not limited to those given to foreigners. Since China and foreign countries are one family, and the world is for all, there is no special "preferential treatment" for foreigners. However, according to experts, Chinese medals are divided into 50% praise and 50% criticism, which is why they embody the "Doctrine of the Mean".</p>
<p>"No Doctor, No Medicine!" by Qin Zhi</p>
<p>Some people are overly sensitive, and a little illness causes a lot of trouble. In fact, this kind of oversensitivity does not help health!</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wu Zhihui is old, he is in good health and rarely gets sick. If he happens to have a minor illness, he adheres to the creed of "no doctor, no medicine" and relies on his own natural treatment from diet and daily life, refusing all the famous Chinese and Western doctors introduced by his relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Lu Xun, who died of lung disease, had his lungs examined by a foreign doctor a year before his death, who said that if a European had Lu Xun's lung disease, he would have died years ago. There is also Mr. Chen Guofu, who is more tenacious and effective in resisting disease than Lu Xun. He has suffered from third-stage lung disease for twenty years, has coughed up countless times, and has suffered countless fierce diseases. During lectures, he put a paper phlegm box in front of him, and spat phlegm while lecturing. When he finished speaking, he had filled several phlegm boxes, but he dealt with the disease very calmly and optimistically. While ill, he continued to hold important and busy positions in the government, and the disease could not defeat him.</p>
<p>Black Tickets by Chi Mo</p>
<p>Now it is very difficult to buy train tickets again. Whether it is express train tickets or slow train tickets, it is not easy to get them.</p>
<p>Chen Bozhuang said it beautifully, calling on passengers to cooperate and not buy black market tickets. You must know, who would want to spend more money to buy black market tickets, but if you can't get white market tickets, you have to resort to the black market. Furthermore, where did this stack of tickets in the hands of those who sell black market tickets come from? This can only be understood without being spoken.</p>
<p>The information desk can also buy tickets with invitations, but you must have "connections" or a "brand name".</p>
<p>The "single helper" has revived again. Most of these single helpers are women, and they have a very big style and are very generous. They are familiar with people in the station and can turn around. The goods they carry are not just "a glance". They don't have to do it themselves. The "red hats" carry them into the military station. Bundles of cloth, wool, cigarettes, and sugar only need to drop some "long ingots", and they can earn several "coffin" ingots. Although the baggage fee has been increased again and again, they (single helpers) don't care at all.</p>
<p>The luggage racks in the carriages, under the seats, and at the entrances are all filled with goods. If someone says something fair, then they have a lot of people. Two fists are hard to beat four hands. Good men should not fight with women.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the two routes of transportation under the blue sky and white sun are controlled by single helpers again.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross-Section: The Organization of the Hua Zi by Huang Jia Mo 1</p>
<p>Local Beggar Gangs</p>
<p>Shanghai is a prosperous and wealthy big city, and its strength is enough to support a large number of parasites and more. Therefore, the "hard picking" beggar gangs of the North, the "gun code" beggar gangs that originated in the north and south of the Yellow River, and the "wind and moon" beggar gangs that roamed the Jianghan area, they have long seen Shanghai as a golden city and jade pass, and they will not easily give up this good place. However, the "old brothers" beggar gangs are not willing to let go of their territory. Because the "old brothers" are all Jiangnan natives in the Suzhou and Shanghai area, although the history of this gang is short, and it is not as long as the above-mentioned beggar gangs, with generations of "bowls" of incense. However, they appear as latecomers, and the brothers in the gang are all locals, so they are not willing to let the foreign paupers usurp the host's position and divide Shanghai, this lucrative position. Because the "old brothers" beggar gangs have the advantage of location, their spirit of striving for life is incomparable to that of foreign beggar gangs. And the way they beg is also unique and original, and they never want to copy the old tricks of foreign beggar gangs. Therefore, in the late Qing Dynasty, when the power of foreign beggar chiefs was great, the old brothers gangs did not compete with foreign beggars for food because they sought other ways, so they did not have any conflicts with foreign beggars. Everyone lived in peace and begged for their own food. Therefore, the foundation can be cultivated and consolidated, and today's glory can be achieved. The doors of beggars, these are all the clever points of the "old brothers" beggar gang's dealings.</p>
<p>Originally the Qing Hong Gang</p>
<p>Although the old brothers are a group organization of rogues, on the surface they are unkempt and unclothed, but when they are mentioned, their rise dates back to the season when the Qing Hong Gang's power began to decline in the late Qing Dynasty. The Qing Hong Gang當年 had seen the world, and had蘊 many heroes in the world. When they declined from prosperity, those capable and 末流 gangsters did not dare to铤而走險 and流落 into rogues due to 困. Due to the pressure of the times, they gathered together and colluded with each other. They relied on Shanghai's commercial wealth and vast land. Thinking that there was great potential for development, they recruited troops and horses and divided their activities. The power of the gang became increasingly strong. Also, because the people in the gang had new ideas and were best at adapting to the needs of Shanghai society, in other words, they could "keep up with the times". This is not something that any "self-enclosed" old-fashioned beggar gang can achieve. Their way of survival is not entirely in begging, but in drilling for ways that they take "every opportunity." New tricks of "picking money" are emerging one after another. Today, they can advance and retreat. The more than three million citizens of Shanghai simply do not pay attention to them. Now the foreign beggar gangs have formed a precarious situation, and their power in Shanghai has been greatly reduced. However, the old brothers gangs are forever clinging to the Shanghai market, forming a deep-rooted superior force. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Filler by Yu Yuan</p>
<p>The news of the investigation team is almost over. I have two pieces of bad poetry, which I will give to her as a farewell.</p>
<p>"The investigation team arrived in a hustle and bustle, declaring that the mission would not be relaxed, not afraid of tigers and flies, and would not end until the stone was revealed.</p>
<p>Hundreds of confidential reports were made, almost none of them could be concluded, the tigers and flies were not caught, and a handful of Qingfeng was caught."</p>
<p>Low-Key Fate by Qing Ke</p>
<p>The municipal government is going to ban fortune-telling and superstitious occupations, so the city's "Institute of Fortune-telling and Philosophy" submitted a "petition" requesting the authorities to implement examinations and appraisals to determine acceptance or rejection. If the examination system is used for fortune tellers, that is a pioneering initiative since the Republic of China: I am very worried that many prostitutes, rickshaw pullers, vendors, water rats, etc., who are destined to be eliminated in the future, will also request examinations and appraisals by way of analogy, then the municipal government will set up an "Examination Bureau", add various specialized equipment, and hire ancestral teachers of various industries to preside over the examinations. This expense is quite considerable.</p>
<p>Let's just look at it this way by Jiang Liu</p>
<p>The dance hall business is also in a slump, and the New York nightclub is also announcing a clearance sale. Many people are worried about the economic panic in Shanghai, but I am happy for the day when the municipal administration will be cleared. Why? Because unemployed dancers will become prostitutes, and prostitutes will be eliminated, from now on women will have to be forced to "go back to the kitchen;" men can be politicians or businessmen, and each can be content with their own duties. Probably the events of fraud, corruption, embezzlement, and oiling will be completely eliminated from now on.</p>

<h3>Chen Huanzhi's Last Two Long Shots: Green Team Defeated Black and White Yesterday; 38 to 33, the Visiting Team Suffered Their First Defeat; in the Men's Game, Black and White Defeated Donghua</h3>
<p>The Black and White and Green teams, two women's basketball teams from the Philippines and Shanghai, met last night at the Municipal Gymnasium. Using women's rules, the audience braved the rain to attend, with about a thousand people. The Green team relied on Chen Huanzhi's last two long shots to defeat the visiting team 38 to 33 and win. In the first half, Black and White were in the lead all the way, with a score of 16 to 13. Chen Wangrun's skill was agile and her performance was particularly outstanding. It is a pity that center Huang Rulan failed to score yesterday, leading to the defeat, which is a great pity. In the men's game after the women's match, Black and White defeated the Donghua football team 64 to 39. The first half was 31 to 27, with Black and White in the lead.</p>
<p>Black and White Women Take the Lead</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM, the women's teams Green and Black and White took the stage. The visiting team fielded Huang Rulan, Lu Shuhui, Wu Yuwu, Chen Yurun, Yang Xiuzhi, and Ouyang Meilan. The Green team fielded Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, Wu Ailian, and Wu Meixi. Chen Yurun scored first under the basket, breaking the deadlock. Huang Mingyuan of the Green team returned the favor. Liu Zhenbao made both free throws, putting the Green team ahead 4 to 2. Huang Rulan and Chen Wangrun also scored three points in a row with free throws. In the first quarter, Black and White led 9 to 6. In the second quarter, Chen Huanzhi arrived and replaced Wu Meixi. Liu Zhenbao retreated to become a defender. Mingyuan scored a point with a free throw, but Huang Rulan and Chen Yurun scored four points in a row, putting them ahead 14 to 11. After Yang Xiuzhi scored again, Lu Shuhui left the court and Cai Shuqiong replaced her. The Green team was 13 to 16 behind in the first half.</p>
<p>Last Two Shots, Green Team Declares Victory</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Mingyuan made a long shot, and Huang Rulan made a free throw, putting the Green team ahead again 18 to 17. The visiting team launched a full counterattack. Chen Yurun scored two goals in a row. Ye Yiqing and Lu Shuhui replaced Ouyang Meilan and Cai Shuqiong. However, Lu Shuhui was injured and left the court not long after entering the court after colliding with Mingyuan. Chen Lixiang replaced her. The battle became even more tense, tying the score at 27 to 27, ending the third quarter. In the last quarter, Lu Shuhui recovered from her injury and re-entered the game, replacing Huang Rulan. Rong Shujian and Chen Wangrun both scored points with free throws. Chen Huanzhi made a long shot, surpassing the score again 30 to 28. At this point, the Black and White forwards were showing signs of panic, and the Green team took advantage of this. With 35 seconds left, Chen Huanzhi's two long shots sealed the victory. When Huang Mingyuan made a free throw, the allotted time ended. The visiting women's team lost to the Green team 33 to 38, their first defeat since arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Football Style, Donghua Suffers Defeat</p>
<p>In the headlining match, Donghua played against Black and White men. Donghua fielded Youliang, Lin Gen, Banglun, Li Yao, and Longhai. Black and White fielded Shi Rongluo, Fu Yongxin, Xu Yinzhen, Li Jinzao, and Shen Renshou. Donghua adopted a full football style, relying solely on courage and lacking tactics. They were still able to resist in the first quarter, but then completely collapsed, fighting individually and without any coordination. Black and White entered an unmanned realm in the second half. There were many jokes in the whole game. Shi Rongluo of the visiting team scored first, opening the record. In the first quarter, they were twelve to Black and White's fourteen. In the second, Donghua's situation, showing signs of improving, Black and White's Renshou made the most of openings on both sides, and when they reached 30 to 19, Lin Gen fouled out, and Yu Qiaxing replaced him. Black and White led 31 to 27 in the first half. After the break, Black and White were still in good shape. At the end of the third quarter, Donghua was further behind, 27 to 54. In the final quarter, Donghua's Youliang again replaced Yu Qiaxing, but morale was low and there was no way to recover. In the end, Black and White won 64 to 39, their third victory since arriving in Shanghai.</p>
