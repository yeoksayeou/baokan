<h3>東北停戰商有協議　派遣小組前往調處　恢復交通辦法正草擬中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕十四日為停戰有效期間第八日，停戰限期祗　七日，茲就過去八日來談判之經過，摘要綜合報吿如下：（一）有關東北問題之停戰談判，自白魯德將軍來京報吿東北衝突實况，並兩晤周恩來後，旋經馬使居間邀集雙方，明白表示對東北之看法，並建議從速派遣執行小組至東北衝突區內，執行停戰命令，以免戰事擴大，影響談判，幾經商討，直至十四日晨十時，周恩來重訪馬歇爾特使，就蔣主席停戰令提示第一項東北停戰一事，作決定性之商談，結果聞已獲致根據三月廿七日有關東北協議三點，立刻派遣執行小組前往調處之協議。據今晚消息，此項議定不帶任何附件，俾使執行小組能切實執行調停之任務。（二）有關恢復交通之修路拆碉談判，經馬使與俞大維，周恩來個別商談不下八九次，由馬，俞，周三方會談者，亦有五次，及至北平執行部交通管理科長希爾上校奉召來京，向馬使報吿過去交通小組之工作經騐曁執行部所　集中國鐵路各大幹綫之情報（包括中共佔領區），並參加二次以上之交通談判後，此一問題經雙方互讓結果，遂於前日獲得初步之協議，惟內容未經宣布。據消息靈通者言，中共對拆除碉堡，分段管理工事，雖不若過去之堅持，但尚採取一部保留態度，現正由俞交長趕擬辦法請示中，故此事祗可說已商有頭緒，然問題本身迄未解決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕京中有資格之觀察家稱：白魯德將軍十五日，回瀋陽，可帶回一東北停戰辦法，希爾上校現在南京期待一個恢復交通的辦法帶回北平去。至必須賦予馬歇爾特使最後仲裁權事，觀乎最近談判之結果，雖不足說明中共對此已有默認之可能，但中共對於此事終將重加攷慮，則大有可能。此因停戰限期已近，中共亦自稱不擬拖延故也。綜上所述，過去八日來之談判，雖不無成就，但因山東局勢嚴重，尚望中共懸崖勒馬，雙方互信互讓，和平前途方有希望。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕白魯德改十五日返平，再經瀋陽轉長春。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕南京三人會議有電致執行部，恢復交通已獲相當協議，只待簽字，執行部交通處已因此佳音而又增忙碌。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕南京恢復交通商談，已至決定具體辦法時限階段，軍調部交通處中共處長黃郴峯，奉周恩來電召，原定十四日飛京，因氣候惡劣，改十五日啓行。黃氏携有恢復交通之各項資料，與黃同行者尚有伍雲甫，伍此行為與聯總行總聯絡共區救濟問題。</p>
<h3>陳毅請派小組赴臨沂　魯局有緩和可能　靑島問題馬周進行商談</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕目前華北之軍事衝突，或可不致深化為全面之內戰，今日中共參謀長羅瑞卿語記者，陳毅今日電執行部，請派濟南徐州兩小組及執行部高級人員前往臨沂，共同商討停止衝突辦法，如是則魯省軍事衝突，猶有商量餘地。羅氏承認山東有多處衝突，但解釋此乃新四軍之報復行為，羅氏主張執行部應加派執行小組，前往華中工作，因目前小組多在華北一帶，華中尚留一大白，至易發生衝突。對於晏城小組，政府代表雷奮強被殺，羅氏謂刻正調查情形，如責在中共，決懲辦肇事人員。按羅氏近曾赴張家口，前始返平。據悉羅之去張，係結束在張原來職務，及料理私事，此外並曾與中共晋察冀邊區政府商談，如何向政府繼續起運糧食以償還政府貸予鄂粵共軍之借款。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕據某權威人士談，中共雖宣稱無意進攻靑島濟南，但截至今日，靑濟兩地仍被圍攻中。以日前局勢言，除非中共自動退出拉法·德州·泰安·棗莊，並放棄進攻六合，威脅京畿之企圖，大局難望樂觀。聞馬使曾面詢周恩來何以在停戰共同聲明發出後，攻佔德州及泰安，周未切實答覆。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十四日電〕濟南小組新任政府代表董宗山少將，十四日飛濟。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十四日電〕中共代表派往靑島制止衝突，原定今日乘機飛返首都報吿，茲以氣候關係，不克成行，靑島危機之解決，致吿延擱。中共發言人王炳南坦白稱：「中共無意佔據靑島，余信一俟本黨代表返此，即可成立解決辦法，該代表大約明日可以返此」。王氏並稱：靑島問題之解決，現正由周恩來與馬歇爾談判中。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島十四日電〕共軍圍攻靑島聲中，駐靑美陸戰隊司令克來門少將特派情報處長納遜中校，於十三日上午七時偕中共代表郝鼎乘美陸戰隊專機，由靑飛臨沂，納遜一行上午八時半到臨後，受共方熱烈歡迎，並面晤共新四軍長陳毅，當晚七時納遜郝鼎原機飛返靑。據陳毅對納遜言定，表示允許停止軍事行動，惟事實上十三日晚共軍並未中止攻擊。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南十四日電〕共軍現在加緊圍困濟南，其攻陷泰安·德州·張店·周村等地，顯係驅逐國軍外圍武力，使不能向外發展，連日更加緊封鎖物資。濟外圍共軍，已集結五萬餘，仍在續增濟南，計明水普集龍山間二萬餘，棗園寺萬餘，萬德為共軍第一師主力，齊河附近三千餘。共軍三千十三日猛攻晏城，濟形勢萬分緊張，省參會及各民衆團體，紛電中央呼　，請派大軍北上應援，人心尚安定，相信中央對魯局，絕對有辦法，惟切盼不能再予容忍，濟市晚十時即戒嚴。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十四日電〕軍息，共軍在魯發動全面攻勢後，其主力迫近濟南南十五公里之處。</p>

<h3>柯克召開會議　美機照常飛靑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳共軍企圖水陸進攻靑島，美駐靑島海軍陸戰隊之長境及態度，頗堪注意。美第七艦隊總司令柯克上將，前晚由靑返滬，昨晨曾與海軍高級長官舉行會議，但據海軍新聞處當局語記者，柯克上將召集之會議，僅係每日例會之一，並無重要決議。同時柯氏此次返滬，對靑島局勢表示樂觀，關於駐靑陸戰隊任務並無變更。美陸戰隊在靑乃保護美國在靑島之財產，現仍將繼續維持此工作。中共軍隊並未侵犯美軍，美軍亦不干涉其事，該發言人認為報端所載，似屬過分誇張。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十四日電〕今日北平之美陸戰隊方面僉稱：共軍正逼近靑島之飛機塲。此項美方消息聲稱：機塲附近一橋樑，業被共軍炸毀，但陸戰隊之定期航機，今日仍由北平飛往靑島上海。</p>

<h3>田樞機主敎廣播全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島十四日電〕樞機主敎田耕莘，十四日午一時飛抵靑，敎友到機塲歡迎者者甚衆，靑市長李先良由京陪同前來。田氏原任靑島主敎，故返靑一行，不久即飛平，就任北平總主敎兼職。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕田樞機主敎耕莘，今向全國敎友廣播，原詞如下：</p>
<p>最親愛的全國敎胞：由天主上智的安排，蒙敎宗的選拔，我今天得以中國首任樞機主敎的名言，向你們致詞，衷心非常愉快。這愉快是天主給我們大衆的，是我們至少從元代以來，早就不斷渴望的，我本人對樞機主敎一職，雖愧不敢當，但為了要實現你們全體的希望，為了要使你們每個人都愉快，我服從了敎宗的命令，忘其谫陋，接受了樞機主敎的任命，我將賴天主聖寵的佑助，貢獻我全部精力，為全國敎會努力。</p>
<p>在今天，我們應該感謝千百年來各修會以及不入會的中外傳敎士的不斷的努力，他們的血汗灌漑了我們這一塊天主的葡萄園地，願天主酬報他們的功勳。我們今天也應該特別感謝現任敎宗庇護十二世，他任命了遠東第一位樞機主敎，他建立了我們公　在中國的敎會體制，他畫定了中國二十敎省，他擢扶了二十位敎省首席總主敎，他將全國宗座代牧區，改為正式主敎區，這一切都是空前的，劃時代的，在中國敎史上，創新紀元的，也就是敎宗對我們中國敎會，一種非常熱愛的表示，我們應該如何感激。我們應為敎宗祈禱，求天主賜以一切恩寵。敎廷首任駐華代表剛恒毅總主敎與現任駐華代表蔡寗總主敎，前後以廿餘年的努力，使中國敎會，獲有今日的殊寵異榮，他們愛護中國，愛護中國敎會，我們雖早就　知，然而今天有了事實的表現，我們也就有了更深一層的認識，我們不能忘懷剛，蔡二位總主敎，將來還保持其在我們心中最深刻的印象，我們應為他們多多祈禱。</p>
<p>我不是客氣，不是謙虛，我確實知道，按我個人的學識才能，我决不配任樞機主敎，可是以中國幅員之大，人口之多，又是一個向來注重禮義文化之邦，如今抗戰勝利，國際地位因亦提高，中國已處於世界重要地位，為求得全世界人類的幸福，或全世界的和平，中國已是一個不可少的因素，敎宗之重視中國，以及擢陞中國樞機主敎，這也是一個主要原因。但是中國今日的重要性，卻是全國國民和我們的領袖蔣主席以八年艱苦抗戰得來的，所以我們應該竭誠擁護中央政府，在蔣主席領導之下，與全國同胞，共同努力，創造新中國。這也是敎宗和我談過多次，並囑我向全國敎內敎外同胞轉達的。現在我們國內，尚未獲得全面和平，政府正在作最後的努力，望我全國敎友，在本月十六日聖三主日，特別為和平而祈禱。</p>
<p>今後我們要作的事太多，一時不能盡說，但我可以向你們說一句，我們現在是臨到了一個新階段，在我們眼前的是一個新局面。我們必須要有新的努力，以適應新的需要，換言之，我們必須有新改革，我們再不能故步自封，停滯在原有地步上，我們必須前進，向前大步邁進，凡舊有的傳敎方式，無論在培植司鐸的敎育事業上，在辦理大中小學校的方法上，在籌劃傳敎的經費上，在推行各種慈善事業上，如果有不合理的地方，或是太保守，不合時代的需要，都應該不惜予以擯棄，而另去尋覓新的方式，當然在改革時，我們應該非常愼重，服從當地主敎的命令，不可輕舉妄動。</p>
<p>各地敎友，今天敎廷已將中國敎會，完全付託在我們中國人身上了，這是莫大的光榮，然而這也是莫大的責任。我們必須團結起來，方能善盡我們的責任，否則我們的力量，就要分散，就要减少，這是很危險的，我們要本耶穌基督的敎訓，互相友愛，在行政上，我們雖為便利管理起見，劃分了敎省，即總主敎區與主敎區，然而在工作上，我們萬不可有敎區的地域觀念，我們要脚踏實地的去做，竭力避免爭取個人的光榮，我們應在一切事上，歸光榮於上主，因為我們的一切，是靠他而作，為他而作，和他同作的。親愛的全國敎胞，今後我們的責任，已加重了，我們全部在敎會體制內的工作人員，自各敎省的首席總主敎，各敎區的主敎，以至各代牧區的宗座·監牧，都需要和全體敎友合作，我個人也極希望能獲得你們的建議，我願審愼考慮，付諸實施，求天主聖神光照我們，指引我們，使我們能穩健地踏上興敎建國的大道，僅向各位致敎宗之祝福，願全能天主，聖父，聖子，聖靈，降福各位聽衆，亞孟。</p>

<h3>社論　薩華王朝沒落的感想</h3>
<p>本報昨載倫敦訊，謂據義王室宣布，義王已乘飛機離羅馬赴葡萄牙。昨晚羅馬電，亦說義王所居王宮之王室旗號，已於十三日下午四時五十分正式卸下。義總理加斯貝里且奉內閣命令，出任義大利國代理元首，並宣布公民投票結果，人民贊成廢止王室，勝利屬諸共和，共和國之成立，隨時可以宣布。義大利前此所進行之不流血革命，至是隨告勝利完成。薩華王朝Ｈouse　of　Savoy為義大利人民所共棄，不得不悄然離國，與其它廢棄王朝，同其海外流亡的命運。這是民主的又一試驗。</p>
<p>由於義大利的這一試驗，可知民衆對於政治上的認識，決不會盲從。以義大利人民一般敎育水準的不如英美，同時二十多年來，又在墨索里尼的法西斯主義掌握下，一般人士頗以義大利此次選舉結果爲慮。所慮者何？義大利値兵燹戰亂之後，秩序未復，地瘠民貧，一般人民均有饑饉的恐懼，此次情形之下，經不起陰謀家的煽動，很容易不自覺地走上一種政治圈套，其結果將使義大利本身以及整個歐洲的前途爲之杌隉不安。然而這次選舉的結果，證明了這種過慮是多餘的。因此，我們更當相信，在民主的常軌下，决不能僞造民意，而依託民主徒唱高調之流，在眞正民主的塲合下，也必然會遭到失敗。</p>
<p>這里還有一點値得我們的注意。這就是這次義大利總選，天主敎黨大獲勝利。在一般人的意料中，以爲天主敎黨係右翼保守黨，必擁護王室，孰知天主敎黨在義大利總選固獲大勝，而義大利王室却就在這次總選中決定了敗亡的命運，而且宣布廢止王室的就是天主敎黨的首領，現任義總理，如今出任義大利國代理元首的加斯貝里。這又可見將天主敎黨與守舊黨保王黨聯混在一起，乃是一種錯誤的偏見。天主敎人中，固然不免有頑固份子，但天主敎信條所代表的應該是頑固，而是與時俱進的維新。</p>
<p>薩華王朝，如今追隨了哈斯堡，和漠朝倫，羅門諾夫，以及其它歷史上的王朝，成爲歷史的陳跡了！這是不可抗的歷史的命運。溯自薩華王朝建立以來，驅逐外軍，統一義大利全國，而樹立現代義大利的規模。其對於義大利民族意識的覺醒，和民族國家的建立，功垂靑史。公道的歷史學家，自然不能因爲現在它的敗亡，遽而加以抹殺。當一八五〇年代，義大利尙爲一個地理名詞，而非一個統一的國家。利用了普奧之戰與普法之戰以統一義大利，建立了近代義大利民族國家的規模，就是崛起在義大利北部的薩華王朝。當時是義大利全國人民忠忱之所歸，如今贊成廢止義大利王室最烈的也就是義大利北部薩華王朝的發祥之地。這是怎樣一種有趣的對照，顯示了歷史的命運怎樣無情。這又可給執政當權者，無論集團或個人，一種親切警惕的敎訓。失了民心的當局，縱使從前對於國家民族有豐功偉業，人民也沒有一定再要選舉保留它的義務。</p>
<p>一九二三年，義大利値大戰之後，民生凋蔽，社會不安。墨索里尼所率領的捧喝團自米蘭進入羅馬，國王命其組織政府，墨索里尼統治義大利的結果，使義大利人民身受其害，而得到他們現在所處的境遇。薩華王朝也當然難逃它所應負的責任。於是終於經人民的共棄而出亡了。於此，更使我們想起日本的皇室。慫恿日本侵略的軍閥政客固然難辭其咎，但日本皇室所負的責任，自亦無可推諉，至少不見得比義國的薩華王朝爲輕罷，但我們到如今還看見日本天皇的逍遙法外，不曾受到什麼制裁。這是否在說明日本皇室眞的受命於神？我們要澈底防止日本的再侵略，一定得先摧毀日本的神權思想，而要達到這目的，必須推翻日本神權思想的偶像—日本皇室。如果日皇還是安然無恙，就會使日本人民發生錯覺，還以爲他本身也許是「神」，所以萬世一系而不能倒。好得現在有盟國管制日本委員會，天皇的統治，還得經過盟軍統帥的節制。觀乎義大利王室的沒落，我們要問：什麼時候我們纔能將日本的皇室也請到歷史博物館裏去？</p>

<h3>工業已屆總崩潰關頭　倒閉工廠已十家　尚有多廠正請准許停業　各業考慮裁員减薪　生產會議幾時開</h3>
<p>頃據社會勞工處長趙班斧談：工業危機，日來漸趨嚴重，各業工廠，因工資，息金，外貨輸入等數層壓迫，業已呈開始總崩潰現象，目前已倒閉之工廠，該局有案可稽者，已達十廠。尚有兩廠，請求停業。三廠要求裁員減薪。諸如此類之情形，業已與日俱增，若不設法補救，則全國經濟總崩潰之期，指日即屆。為補救此項危機起見，趙氏提出意見兩項：（一）由政府以低利息，無限制放貸工業貸款。（二）協調勞資紏紛，嚴厲取締暴力挾制等不合法理之違法舉動。</p>
<p>又訊：記者昨日曾分訪各業領袖，叩詢各業生產狀况，歸納所談，為（一）原料缺乏，成本過高。（二）工資佔總數百分之二十五，加重成本。（戰前僅佔總數百分之五）（三）利息佔總數百分之二十，若以物品自購原料起至製成品出售止，以兩月計算，息金即佔製成品成本之總數百分之四十。（四）外貨源源而入，國產品無法與之競銷。故目前各業，均在考慮裁員減薪緊縮停業中。據悉本市針織廠三分之一業已停止生產，其餘三分之二工廠，均在考慮停業中。各業咸望生產會議能即日召開，以挽民營工業於倒懸。</p>

<h3>高院審奸開新紀錄　定本月廿一日下午宣判　梁鴻志案歷五小時審結　檢察官補充被吿所犯罪行之證據　法院傳到證人薛大可對質　憑七律詩一首請從輕科刑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東南地區首先叛國投敵，組織偽政權，懸掛五色旗，成立所謂維新政府，代敵統治佔領區，助紂為虐之梁鴻志，業於昨日下午審理終結，定廿一日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>劉庭長與曹邱二推事曁戴檢察官，書記官，昨日下午三時升座後，由庭丁呈上與梁有關案卷高達尺餘。首由戴檢察官直立補充被吿在偽職任內所犯罪行之事實與證明文件，分為三類：（一）「維新政府」任內者；（二）「中華政府聯合委員會」任內者；（三）參加偽國民政府以後者；計有「維新政府初週紀念册」，偽內政部反共救國代表會計劃大綱，「中」日條約周年紀念宣言，反共救國民衆大會宣言，偽交部褚靑來對於「中」日合辦各公司之提案，「和平反共建國文獻」等重要文件多種。由劉庭長過目後，交梁一一詳閱，除略有推諉責任問題外，均承認不誤。乃由劉庭長問梁還有什麼聲辯。梁供：「我組織維新政府，第一為了保存國家元氣，其次為了减少人民痛苦，並非甘心從敵，與中央對抗。訪問日本，祗是禮節上的答訪，並未訂立外交協定。至於汪兆銘發表「　電」，我不知中央意思，以為是雙管齊下，所以旣不反對，亦不贊同。迨廿九年春初，中央孔副院長派代表薛大可來滬，接洽向中央供給屋後，故託薛轉發電文一通，表白其心跡。嗣由劉庭長傳訊證人薛大可。據薛供稱：民國廿九年三月間來滬，從事偽方分化工作，梁即託其代發長電一通，大意為表明其投偽心跡，為减輕人民痛苦，並無反抗中央之意，並得覆電，謂暫在偽方不要走開云云。至卅三年間，曾由梁營救在北平之中央政治工作人員，前北平輔仁大學法學院院長董人驥，及現任北平敎育局長莫千里等出獄。該二人均被偽法院判刑十五年，由梁具保釋放者。至此，劉庭長應檢察官之請，命薛暫出外，轉訊梁云：「營救地工在何時？」答：「卅四年春。」問：「董人驥當時押在那裏？」答：「押在北平憲兵隊。」問：「怎樣保出來的？」答：「託岡田從南京打電話到北平日公使館。」答：「他們有何表示？」答：「沒有。」問：「薛大可何時來？」答：「廿九年二三月間，奉行政院副院長之命來滬。」問：「在那裏和你談話？」答：「在偽行政院。」問：「你和薛有何關係？」答：「沒有什麼關係。」乃又傳記薛大可對照供詞，僅接洽之地址不誤，薛初說為立法院，後又說是監察院。梁又補充說：「在偽維新政府時代，日方曾強欲梁組成政治保衛局與糧食統制局，結果未成，故對民有利。而且在廿七·八兩年中，從來沒有殘殺過一個志士，也未欺詐過一家良民。以我一介書生，與侵略者抗辯，對抗戰有微功，決非意圖反抗本國。」辭畢，劉庭長宣吿開始辯論，首由戴檢察官直立論吿，略謂梁為軍閥時代之政客，為親日之安福系中人物，乘國軍西撤之時，獨擋一面，組織「維新政府」，以對抗中央，其通謀敵國之行為，實屬顯見。而被吿欲以不設特工與糧統機關，自認為於民有利，亦不確當，蓋於民有利者，必須有積極之行為也。嗣又對偽職任內之罪行，多所論列後，即由章士釗，朱鴻儒，李國珍三律師循序為被吿辯護。章律師稱：「被吿（一）非國民黨員，與叛國而又叛黨者不同；（二）自始至終無抗衡國家之起意與形迹。（三）自首最早，抗戰末期，與任援道共同禦匪，抵制亂軍。（四）在偽府任內並無惡政。」朱律師稱：「安福系根本無此東西，彼等之首領段公，三復共和，有功民國，決非親日派。而現在治奸，應不問偽不偽，但問奸不奸。被吿在「維新」時代，曾懷念宗邦，譏評日寇，有七律一首，「拋却文書即酒杯，駸駸佳日去不回，身疑春蘭重重縛，心似勞　寸寸灰。階下弓刀類兒戲，限中幢節幾人才，鞭笞六國尋常事，只惜秦人不自哀。」愛國之股，怨敵之深，洋溢字裏行間，其心可見，故請審酌案情，從輕科刑。」李律師則特別重言梁之有功。但梁最後却說：「成績不用表明，但心迹非表明不可。」至此時已八時零五分，劉庭長即論辯論終結，定廿一日宣判。昨日梁案審訊達五小時，開高院審奸以來新紀錄。退庭後，已夜色朦朧，而梁仍接見其家屬，時梁衣芝蔴呢夾長衫，下穿藍綢褲，黑皮鞋，手中將一白竹骨摺扇，並携老光眼鏡一副，背駝腰彎，髪亦白，狀甚蒼老，其妻脂粉滿面，與梁相對，殊顯年靑，經互相慰問後，梁即為法警押回監獄。</p>
<h3>趙鉦鏜</h3>

<h3>趙尊嶽</h3>
<p>又高院昨日提審曾任偽宣傳部長等職之趙尊嶽。趙為常州人，四十九歲。據供：「政府西撤後，人民未能完全撤退，江浙兩省三千萬民衆，在敵人壓迫下，日處水深火熱之中，其痛苦可以想見。汪兆銘來滬後，約我談天，因我在滬頗外，且服務於新聞界，故與汪頗熟。所談結果，為在抗戰勝利之過程中，必須挽救此種陷於地獄之苦痛人民。為民求利，不計功罪。在不違反抗戰之原則下，我始就任偽職，參加和　。」又對實行苛捐重稅，推行奴化敎育，統制新聞等各點，一一否認。嗣由辯護律師聲稱：趙在偽職期內，曾掩護秘密電台工作，請求庭上傳訊證人，王堯欽陸以銘，羅賓，蓋曾由羅介紹於劉百川，由趙設立電台，以與中央通消息。經詳詢一過，庭論改期再訊。</p>

<p>煩悶中期望安定與明朗　東北第一個初夏  特派員韓清濤　　本報二日長春航訊　　　　東北的春天，幾乎每天要刮風，沙土飛揚滿天，斷送了大好春光，有興致到野外踏靑的人，去時或者得以倖免，回來總是汚穢面孔，塵土遮蓋了衣履，除了早晨或者偶而有幾個淸朗天氣，東北的春天就這樣的過去。　　春在風沙裏消失，現在東北已經開始初夏季節了，街頭來往的人，脫去了棉毛，換上了夾衣，有的穿上了單衫褲，靑年婦女，好像比男人來得熱些，上身雖然還是長衣，長袖，可是下半身已經常常令人看到部份的裸露。煩悶天氣　痛心國事　　初夏帶來的熱，雖然熱的不厲害，但是東北光復後的第一個初夏，大家都感到有些悶，悶的魔力，打進了各階層，甚至男女老少，都在喊悶的使人發慌，傳言裏，報紙上時時在加重悶和慌的力量。　　春天沒刮完的風沙，初夏帶來的熱，混和成了天然的一種悶的因素，再加上人爲的種子，把一般人都籠罩在悶的圈子裏，在悶的圈子裏打轉，在悶的圈子裏生活，他們煩悶，他們悲痛，煩悶天氣，痛心國是！　　最初他們聽說祖國在抗戰中，打成了四大强國裏面的一佩大强國，眞是高興萬分，可是他們看到現在的東北局面，又使他們發生了懷疑，懷疑的是旣爲强大國家，爲什麼內部還有問題，以至把東北造成了這個局面？　　他們感覺到第一個是接收的人太多，你接收，他也接收，以致演成了火拚，拚的太可憐，也太可惜，大的接收有阻礙，瀰漫着硝烟彈雨，何時爲止，如何得了，一般人的意見，還是要由政府統一辦理—但須改變作風，再加上淸廉，不能把公產變作私產，纔不失爲强大國家的體統，人民也不至遭受身爲强國和光復了的人民不應遭受的窘迫和塗炭。　　今天，東北除了偏僻和邊遠的地方外，，各地物價普遍飛漲，居處東北軍政中心的瀋陽人民，更是有切身之痛，高糧米一再的提高價格，隨着往上跑的是煎餅，大餅子，以及一般的小米，包穀等雜糧，這是東北人民主要的食品，是他們活命的源泉，簡單的有了鹹菜和大醬，把高糧米飯送下肚，就可心滿意足了，一點沒有過高的要求。　若是沒有了這些，或者買不起高價的這些東西，那他們指望着什麽活命？可是有些地區，糧車受阻進不了城區，城區的糧米，那能不高漲，大家在說：「不穿衣，不吃菜沒關係，可是不能不吃飯啊，」也有的在說：「這怎得了，老天爺是不呌我們活命了」。處處表現他們是如何的痛心！　　有人在問：「談判始終談不完嗎？沒有成功希望嗎？三人小組也無能爲力嗎？不然的話，東北局勢爲什慶沒有好的改變，沒有大的好轉，不幸的在目前或者更加惡化，更加緊張，東北就這樣長久下去嗎？」　　東北工廠，很少得能恢復，失業工人閒了大半年，雖然有一部份的改了行，又有一部份轉到跑生意的路途上去，但沒有去路的失業工人，睜了兩隻大眼睛，一直在盼望，可是希望越來越渺小，同時爲了吃飯沒辦法的人，也在逐漸的加多，善後救濟總　東北分署的救濟品，眞是杯水車薪，地方政府的救濟辦法，也是無濟于事。　　城市裏面的搶案，雖然不常有，可是偏僻的鄉村，時常閙「胡子」——土匪，遼河兩岸，鐵路綫稍遠地方，竟而有「胡子」結成了大幫，滋擾，强搶，人民怎能安居樂業？大幫土匪，又是多麽駭人聽聞事啊，將來穀類秧稞長高，「靑紗障」起，那更要變本加厲呢！內外夾攻　苦了民衆　　記者在這些嚴重問題裏，抽出了一個吃飯問題，做了一番調査，一般人對記者說：「城市糧食感到缺乏，是糧源被遮斷，賣糧人和糧車過不來，糧價那能不飛漲，同時糧商看到糧米進來的少，就要做囤積生意，裏外夾攻，苦了人民，尤其是家無隔宿糧的人，東北這樣困難的人民。正多着呢！　　地方當局爲了這些，曾作種種努力，稍獲效果，如在外縣購糧等，就是一個例子，平抑物價的事也在做，果然沒弊病，當然是不錯，如果平抑只管平抑，操縱只管在有辦法的人手中操縱，那始終是辦不好的。　　爲了把這些問題，得到多方面的解答，記者特又造訪住在瀋陽和平區中蘇聯誼社，「三人小組」共產黨方面代表　組長漱石先生，他對記者說：「東北問題，現在是和平和戰爭，能和平當然是大家都願意的事，不能和平，那就是要戰爭了，三人小組工作已經停頓好久了，原因在　北平和重慶方面的命令，可是命令始終來不了」！　　東北人民希望很簡單，只有兩件事，那就是「有飯吃」和「生一活安定」，饒組長也不否認，同時也是在這樣的說，記者提出了糧源被共方遮斷的問題，向他請敎，他說；「這是戰爭存在的原因，在戰爭期間，共方不能不對此有所限制，沒有戰爭，東北幾個城鎭糧食問題也沒有了」，同時他也在表示：「我現在也很有興趣，同時也願意救助糧荒，設法開放糧源，不過須視有否從中操縱取利的人在。」　　東北人民，現在幾個稍感糧食缺乏和物價高漲的城市裏，雖然有些怨言，但對國家始終是有一腔熱血，沒有半點含糊，他們對於隨時隨地觸進眼簾里的：「東北是中國的東北」。「東北是中國的生命綫」。　頭壁間的標語，認識很清楚，意志很堅強，其他大小城市鄉鎮裏的居民，有何獨不然！　　初夏帶來的風和熱，配合着：破壞交通，遮斷糧源，大局暗淡，以及現有接收和行政上部份的弊端和不合理的存在，使東北人民煩悶。他們一致祈禱着：明朗，安定，建設，有飯吃！湘災達狂虐程度　哈里遜調查團　實施勘災紀詳　連呼可憐不止  特派員高元禮　　本報六月一日長沙通訊　　　　「湖南災情之慘，非　歷其境者，不能體會其　相」。王主席東原去湘南視察災情後，回長沙後對記者這樣說。王主席是四月底到省接事，僅僅就職五天，就立即趨車赴衡陽等縣去視察災情，這黯可以想像湖南災情如何嚴重，也可以者出新省府對救災有着如何東大的決心。　　隨王主席同去的有社會處長劉修如，和救濟分署副署長姚雪懷，六日早晨由長沙出發，歷經衡山，衡陽，祁陽，零陵，邵陽五縣，幷至耒陽邊境，所行約一千公里，沿途訪問農村在一百處以上。據王氏對記者說：「未見一處老百姓有飯吃，他們碗裏盛的是草，鍋裏煮的也是草。過去說湖南多在挨餓吃草，人家是不相信的，」各方面對湖南慘重的災情，還不免抱着懷疑的態度。就是本人未到湘南的時候，也未始不然。此次親身走了一趟才證實收復區同胞確在　餓綫上掙扎。賣掉孩子　換不到一担米　　衡腸四週的農村，無米無麥，一般農民完全拔草充飢。他們也沒有耕牛，就用人來代替犁田。前面四個人拖，後面一個人推，有的前面還只有一個人的，可是因爲人力不够，於是各村之間，實行助耕，相互爲牛，但在這種困難情况之下，他們仍孜孜不服，擔救春耕，至於兒女多，食指繁的人家，多賣孩子換糧食充飢。有一家一個孩子賣了四萬元，可惜還買不到一石米。嬰孩沒有奶吃，養不活，則悄悄的丢在大戶人家或保育院門口。無孩子可賣的，就典當東西，而他們所能當的東西，無非是一些破舊不堪的衣物用具而已。衡陽大街小巷，無處不是飢民露宿，難童塞途，不是親自看到這幅大流民圖，誰也不會相信人間有這樣的慘象。王主席一席話，把湘南各縣的災悄，描畫得很淸楚。他說：衡陽一縣，非賑濟不能生活的人民就有十四萬之多，而以東北西鄕最壞，幾乎全部吃草。西鄕較好，也不過草裏加點糠粃而已。十歲少女　連草也沒有喫　　王氏等在湘南視察的期中，美總統代表哈里遜調査團，於十一日飛到衡陽。王主席和救濟分署長余籍傳分別由長，邵，兩地趕往晤談，哈里遜一行，共計十人，有聯總行總代表，美糧部代表，和我國行政院農林部糧食部代表，他們到衡陽下機後，立即開始調査工作，由余籍傳署長陪同乘車，沿公路視察。哈里遜氏在車上東瞧西望，找災民，找村莊，他不明瞭我國農村的組織，所以在車上幾乎是不相信這遍土地裏會有駭人聽聞的慘事，在離城十里後，才看見路旁倒臥了一個小女孩。哈氏立即下車撫視，見其尙有一息，問她才十歲父母被日兵殺死，兩月來未吃過大米，經常是吃草過活。最近兩天，連草亦沒有吃，哈氏的同情心馬上爲之激發，拿出兩千元法幣，把這個小女孩送到一家飯舖裏吃飯。那個女孩子在得到豐富的營養後，面色紅潤，有說有笑，由此哈氏深感救濟的迫切。所喫草類　全無絲毫營養　　在距衡陽三十公里白鶯拗車站，哈氏進入了有六百人口的貫冲。這裏，哈氏親自看見一幅流民圖，貫冲的飢民，事先全不知道會有人來視察，所以眞相畢露，殘破的茅舍，形容枯槁的災民，遍地都是。哈氏每家訪問，直入廚下，找不出一粒米，鍋裏煮的全是野蔴尖和野蒲公英。哈氏速說：「可憐得很！」「可憐得很！」　　哈氏回城，立即發電給上海聯總辦事處和行總。電文上說：「我完全證明湖南災情已到狂虐（Ranpant）程度。你們爲何把聯總運到上海的糧食賣了，不運到湖南來？立即運米，麥，豆，和麵粉，到湖南來，避免　荒直至秋收」。哈氏對余籍傳氏說：「你們爲何不請宋子文院長和胡佛先生來看看呢！」他很感慨的對記者說：「上海的FatRicher（富豪）和Great　Officiais（大官）一席萬金，恣情享樂，應該請他們來看看才好！」他幷且說：「吃草的事情，在印度和墨西哥曾看見過，但那些草類，大體上選有點營養。在衡陽看見的情形，那更嚴重，他不相信那些草類是有營養的」。飢民難童　冒雨露宿簷下　　當天晚間，王主席和哈里遜作長時間的會議，討論救濟間題。王氏强調湖南之災，不僅是水旱之災，而是由於湖南民性强悍，抵抗强暴的侵略，極爲劇烈，所以敵人加以有計劃的破壞，以致城市爲墟，　村凋敝。因此，我們有權要求聯合國予以有效的救濟。王氏提出湖南的災民總數有五百卅萬人，而其中有三百五十萬人非賑不生。哈氏承認這數字只有少，不會多。哈氏幷說：他到湖南祇救了一個人，就是那個路旁小女孩。王氏則說：那一位女孩子只是湖南全省災民的代表，若不嫌疲勞，本人可陪同到街上走走，一見便知。哈氏欣然願往，當時已晚間十時左右，夜雨傾盆，哈氏撑着傘和王主席到了街上，屋簷下淋着雨，睡滿了飢民和難童，差不多都奄奄一息，爲數約有四五千之多，慘絕人寰，哈氏看見亦搖首不止。　　哈氏在衡陽停留的時間雖不多，但是可以說較任何人更明瞭湖南的災情，因此今後的湖南救濟工作，可望積極展開，救濟物資的可以增加運來，因爲擁有五百卅萬災民的地區，半年來祗得到四千多噸物資的救濟，災情如何不越加嚴重？怪不得哈里遜說：它確已到了狂虜程度！　　救濟物資的運輸，在湖南成爲重大問題，鐵路的橋樑迄尙未修好。粤漢路局負責人說，要在兩月後才能完工。公路情形亦不好。最近大雨兼旬，各處的橋樑衝斷，管理公路工程的，你推我諉，誰也不負責。航運更成問題。宣傳已久的登陸艇運物資來湘，也迄未實現，交通幾乎是全部窒息。兩個口號　政治社會兼重　　王主席在湘南巡視一週後，十二日回抵長沙，立即提出兩個口號：一是「政治救災」，一是「社會救災」，以爲「自救」和「互救」的張本。他說：所謂「政治救災」，就是集中政治的力量來救災，現在人民都要餓斃，還談得上什麼政治設施？地方官吏祇有奮其全力來爲人民救命要緊。要眞能爲人民救命，必須根絕貪汚，勤政愛民，使災民受到實惠。本人雖沒有多大力量，但可以運用權限以內的全部政治力量，來貫澈這個主張。其次所謂「社會救災」，是根據人類的同情心，發動社會力量來救災。規定災荒嚴重的各縣，實行地方自救互救的辦法，責任縣長及鄕保負責，嚴格執行，以重民命。這是因爲外來的救濟物資，終不免遠水不救近火，而且杯水車薪，往往無濟於事，不如本地方大家起來，實行自救，最爲確切迅速。例如祁陽原有救濟分署所設粥廠，只能調濟五百人，後來由當地人士捐募，自設粥廠，能賙濟三千人。衡山，衡塲，邵塲等縣，也已經開始仿行，應該使全省普遍實行這個辦法。種籽貸款　分署濫收費用　　王氏所宣布的兩項辦法，確是針對目前的需要，但是政治救災的需要，各縣都很迫切，零陵就曾發生過這樣一件事：一位救濟分署工作隊，在鄕裏發放種籽貸款，剛發放完畢，離開之際。保甲長跟着就向受領者收取手續費，草鞋費，以及茶水費，有的竟全部被收去。有人把這事報吿王主席。王氏說：現在保申長是人民選的，不是政府官吏，人民有罷免權，可是人民呢，還不是個個安分守己，誰願多事，這是自治的「成績」。讀者意見　規約　　（一）本　絕對公開，文責自負。但切忌長。（二）切勿攻訐私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本欄稿件概不致　。（五）對來稿本報有删節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，槪不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。勸購軍糧的一幕　　編者先生：前日宜興蜀山鎭鼎蜀區公署指導員率領着十數個兵士，在敝鄕表演了這樣一件事實：兪指導員對保長們說，「你們鄕裏太混蛋了！勸購的軍米怎樣了？今天能不能齊？」某保長比較有胆氣就回答着：「報吿指導員，這軍米事，我等一再向民衆勸購，無奈每戶農民，羅雀掘鼠，吿僅無門，實在沒法。况且這一期二期而今又要三期的軍米，呌名是勸購，但是老百姓可曾見着一個大子？老百姓還要說我們吞吃公款呢！」指導員說：「那我不管，今日我們是奉區長命令來取軍米的，若軍米沒有，我們就得帶人。」兪指導員發怒了！一個赤着脚剛從田裏爬出的保長乞憐似的說，「好不好待我們農忙過了再說，那時有米自然繳米，無米我們保長也只索代表着老百姓去坐牢監。」兪指導員把槍也拉出來了。「好，帶了走！」兪指導員發了命令，於是如狼似虎的兵，押着四五個保長要去，有的保長還想掘強，—拍！拍！手槍走火了！唉！旣說是勸購，那末錢呢？—錢是只聽見樓梯響，不見人下來，只是來了，來了，來到今日，第一二期的不曾見一元，而這第三期又要購了。這錢是到那裏去的？據脫是充了什麽槍械費，縣費，鄕經費了。錢是沒有，還要荷槍押人！　　苦煞老百姓，而讓這班　鄙之徒中　，還成什麽世界？　　宜興震東鄕許　人上六月八日。我們將變成剝皮老鼠了　　一個士兵的來函　　編者先生：我是　餘的軍佐，總算當局關心，設置軍官總大隊，收容我們，還打算分發優良的物品。四月廿八日大隊長在新鄕宣佈每個隊員將分到人字呢衣料二套，黃卡機襯衣二套，皮鞋一雙，毛巾一條，但是事實並不如此。五月九日第二批到達上海，六月一日每人分到的是人字呢軍服一套，草絲布褂衣一套，白洋布一條（長一尺七吋，寬八吋），白洋布不知代毛巾抑或作領巾，未曾說明，而軍服又非經修改，不合身材，爲了軍容，只好忍痛付出萬餘元的修改工資。在新鄕時的「團高興已消失，但是新令又來了。六月六日大隊部頒第四五五三號代電，凡離職人員服裝悉數收繳，那末我們將變成剝皮老鼠了。假如一旦實行，把我們僅剩的錢，做了衣服，就無旅費，可是也不能不穿衣服！我們　批尚需養家活口的人此時將何以處置？繼炎上。　　縣級公務員鳴不平　　編輯先生：披閱最近幾天的閩省各報章，陸續刋載惠安縣縣政人員全體辭職，和福安縣全體縣政人員爲了待遇岐異，發出呼聲，爲全閩數萬縣政人員籲請改善待遇的新聞，以及各報同情的寫出促進政府合理改善縣政人員的待遇的評論。我們身爲縣政人員休戚相關，不禁同情的起而響應。——我們縣政人員，自抗戰以還，和中央及省級人員同樣肩起重荷，在物價隨時增深下，含辛茹苦的埋頭苦幹。但於今我們縣政人員，却一直屈伏在落伍的待遇下掙扎生存。相形之下，怎能抑制住我們的滿懷憤懣？各地的物價縱有差異，在生活程度高昂的地方，提高公務員的待遇，我們毫無異議，但駐縣的中央機關和省級機關的公務員，與縣政人員，同爲國家服務，生活程度相若，何以其待遇因中央省縣之不同，而津貼如成竟有偌大的歧異？幸而爲駐縣的中央機關的和省級機關公務員，享受　豐席厚，悠哉優哉；不幸而爲縣政人員，則收入不敷個人糊口。——厦門市警察局事務員出賣週歲的兒子，得價三萬元，購四十斤的米，就是一個最悽慘的例證！誰無父母？誰無妻孥？相亙比較，苦樂懸殊，又怎能譴責我們享受不能維持最低生活的薪津的縣政人員，爲了瞻顧家庭，都想改絃易轍，去中央機關當勤務？建陽縣政府職員蔡古初等啓。哈佛大學內設置之巨型望遠鏡（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）僑胞捐輸白米八萬噸　暹羅來鴻  曼谷四日通訊　武弘寄自無錫　　友人張君於還都前，由首都明故宮機塲專機飛渝，四月四日專機飛昆，在昆明躭擱一宵，次日轉飛受谷。由昆明至曼谷，約數千英哩，乘飛機僅數小時即達。產米產木　與緬甸相伯仲　　暹羅是英法兩國邊境屬地的緩衝地帶，所以能得到所謂「獨立於一角」的特殊地位。國內出產，以米木爲大大宗，和緬甸相仿。米的產量，尤爲豐富，爲世界著名產米國之一。所產柚木，（英文名稱爲Teck　wood）品質優良，聞名世界，專銷英美兩國，爲高貴木材。未鋸料（即毛坯）每三方英尺價値泰幣二十餘銖，（每銖合國幣一百十元餘，一美元合十七·七銖）已鋸就者，每三方英尺，約四十餘銖。　　將來柚木如能大量運華，預計在我國木材市塲上，一定極佔勢力。　　所產白米，質地甚佳，最上品者，每包僅九十餘銖。（約合國幣一萬元。）可是，因爲有和英國訂立的停戰協定的束縛，在幾年之內，除充作賠償外，恐怕不能再供給其他國家，這也是一個造成世界糧荒的間接原因。華僑愛國　熱情始終不減　　旅暹華僑，雖然受到外人的欺凌，並沒有因祖國的抗戰戰勝利而一提高他們的地位，但他們愛護祖國的熱情，並不因此稍减。他們一聽到了國內糧荒的嚴重，自動募集白米八萬噸，以救濟祖國爲　　中的難胞。　　此項白米，已呈准聯合國善後救濟總署撥船裝運，據友人張君說：截至四月十日爲止，已運出數千噸。計算日子，大槪早已到華。希望華僑熱心捐助祖國的八萬噸白米，能够不折不扣的落到難胞的肚中。他們將出賣苦力換得的血汗錢，救濟祖國的糧荒，這種推己及人的偉大精神，每一個國人聽到了，應該如何地感動—米　門再不拿出一良心來，那真是死有餘辜！同時，希望賢明的當局，暫時停止向米商採購軍糧，另想一個補救辦法，等挨過了這個難關再說。　　海外的僑胞們，是這樣的關心着祖國，熱愛着祖國。過去他們受着外國人的欺侮，忍氣吞聲，此刻我們是勝利了，列入了强國之林，希望政府當局能撫輯海外僑胞，使他們在國外安心經商。訪高爾基故居　屋內一切都保持着原状　　俄國偉大作家高爾基於一九三六年六月十八日逝世以來，迄已十年。蘇聯國內已開始舉行紀念週。　　凡高爾基所住之處，如度其兒童時代之高爾基城及溘然長逝之卡山城等，均設高爾基紀念館。　　莫斯科瑪拉耶尼基次卡耶街，爲城內風量最優美區域之一。　大俄羅斯作家高爾基在一生最後五年中居住及工作之住宅，即在於此。住宅四周，有、樹木茂盛之花園，廣闊之扶梯通入內室及作家之房間。　　書室充滿光綫　　高爾基之書室充滿光綫。中央有大寫字確一只，上舖綠色　布·在　之附近有小玻璃嚴水瓶一只，及高爾基使用之木筆一枝。桌上置有條紋之白紙一疊，其旁有烟缸一只，與莫斯科「爪哇」牌之香烟一包。此種香烟爲高爾基所愛好，此外並有牛角邊眼鏡一付。　　安樂椅子一隻　　在桌子之旁，有舒適之安樂椅一只，其背甚高，上置紅色天鵝絨整。高爾甚於臨死不久前，曾在該　上工作，向科學家，藝術家與作家以及國外人士所發表之著名呼籲名爲「文化人站在哪一邊」者，亦在此時寫成。在該論文中，高爾基警吿世界與論，指出德國法西斯王義對歐洲文化之威脅，並敦促外國文化人士團結一致予以反抗。　　生平嗜好物件　　屋中之物件說明高爾基之趣味，習憤及嗜好。渠愛好象牙，紫銅與木質之藝術雕刻品，此等物件，均係高爾基在旅行時所搜集者。　　在書室之旁爲高爾基之臥室。床旁有書架一只，書籍中有柯羅侖柯·薩克萊，海湼之作品以及貝侖格之歌曲一小卷。　　高爾基爲常時最淵博人物之一，渠對於世界各國文學之智識，實堪驚人，（塔斯社，十二日。社會服務　答復讀者　　醫藥衛生　　（一）傅維烈間　敝人自卅三年春患腎虧而盜汗，最劇時竟至不能起床，至今二年有餘，精神稍痊十分之七，惟盜汗始終未愈，國藥中汗敵已服過無效，未識美國西藥中有無治盜汗之特效藥？請即賜復。　　〔醫藥博十顧毓琦答〕須經X光詳細檢査肺部，恐係結核之初期，或因身體虛弱之故，美國出品之各種維太命丸及補血藥水，可常服。　　（二）賈佩間　敝人係貴報一忠實讀者，每閱社會服務欄代人解答各種疑難問題，深爲　動。敝友某君自幼面部生長雀斑，曾就醫於美容院，雖治療時較淺，但不數日仍復原狀，請問雀斑如何預防生長？二如已生長，能否治愈？　　〔醫學博士顧毓琦答〕此症須請皮膚科專家硏究治療之。（三）齊偉英問　余患劇烈性遺精，兼尿道刺痛症，達一年半之久，去春三月至六月間，曾斷續注射維他命，葡萄糖等針劑約六十餘針，現此症未見澈底痊愈，每月仍有四五次，遣後有時身體極不適，有時則　此現象，請問是否仍當治療？如何始能澈底根治？（二）三年前冬季患重肺炎症，愈後左右肺部即時常隱隱作痛，用手按之，則似肋骨作痛，一年前曾屢照X光，均謂正常，惟此症至今　綿難愈，請問如何方能根治？（三）身體瘦弱，特常傷風，每於吃中飯後，必異常疲倦，四肢乏力，不知應如何治療？　　〔醫學博士顧毓琦　〕（一）最好再注射補血針，葡萄糖鈣，及維太命西，可每星期二三次注射之，大便可化騐一次。（二）恐已成　　　　　炎症，最好拍一X光照片，有無肺結核浸潤。（三）均爲初期肺結核之嫌疑，有時透視難診斷，故仍以拍X光照片研究爲妙。徵求人才　　（一）中央某出國人員　聘秘書一人，須諳法語，習機械或電機者，並以四十歲以下男性爲合格，待遇除按中央標準支給底薪四百元，作爲安家費外，本人國外費用，從優另給。（二）北四川路某公館徵求保姆一人，須忠誠可靠，略通文字，待遇面洽。（三）某鮮橘水廠徵聘技師一人，須有製造鮮橘水經騐者爲合格，待遇二十萬元，供膳宿。（四）海　路某公館徵聘女家庭敎師一人，初中或高中畢業，上課時間上午十時至二時，以能講國語爲合格，待遇四五萬元，每日供中飯一餐。（五）某獨立汽車營微求機工十五人，翻沙工四人，及補胎工四人，以具有土項經騐者爲合格，工資暫定三萬元，伙食服裝均由資方供給，如是日本服務，工資加　發給，並以國外待遇爲標準。（六）江西路某商行徵聘英文家庭敎師一人，以能操國語並敎初中英文者爲合格，上課時聞每晚七點到八點，待遇五萬元，任期半年。（七）南京廣播電台徵求男女傳音員各一人，須高中以上程度，能操純粹國語，口齒伶利，待遇二十至二十五萬元，膳宿自理。應微者請向北四川路八百五十六號社會部上海職業介紹所接洽。海門避難災民　即日開始登記　　其　善後救濟對策　　蘇北海門因受共軍壓迫，紛紛逃避上海，日必數百人，風餐露宿，慘不忍　、現經旅滬熱心人士，倣照各縣辦法，組織海門難民流亡上海登記處，於北京路江西路鹽業大樓四樓通如崇海啓同鄕會與建國中路六十五衖四號施維智診所，凡海門先後逃難來滬者，不分貧富，均可即日前往登記，以便彙報救濟總署上海分署及蘇北難民救濟會，要求救濟，　關　身痛　　幸勿遲誤。將作原子彈試騐犧牲品之　艦「納伐達號」該艦歸為卅年。現泊於美國加州洛杉磯港，不久即駛抵比基尼　，以供試騐。（本報特約時報攝寄）</p>

<p>自由谈創造迷  少夫　　據說市政建設，又有種種偉大的計劃了。　　什麼黃浦江上要造大橋咧，地下要通電車咧，…上海够不上紐約，倫敦，巴黎的規模，確乎有點失體面。　　我們小市民，自然樂於聽到這些好消息。但高興之餘，回轉頭來一想，便又爽然若失了。何以故，比如糞便之還仰仗倒老爺，一路電車為什麼大都不停橫浜橋海寗路，可憐柏油馬路遍體鱗傷，攤販之擺滿行人道，蘇州河臭氣薰天，……卑之無甚高論，實事求是，我們祗希望將馬路弄弄平，垃圾掃掃淸，許多怪物汽車別在市區內橫衝直撞，電車公共汽車多開幾部，也就心滿意足了。　　大家都知道造一條新馬路比修一條破爛馬路更容易見功討好，所以官無論新舊，都有「創造迷」。於是新路日有增加，而舊路日見破爛。許多人說，官家事往往可作如是觀。平心說我們所需要的還是一批實事求是的傻子，把原有的工作先充實起來，健全起來，行有餘力，再謀雄　。　　因為，乞丐並不對德國牛排意大利通心粉發生興趣的。我的勤務兵  菊引　　去年的冬天，我突然奉命由司令部調來砲兵營服務。到了連部包圍着我的都是一羣陌生的人。不單是環境過不慣，就是連日常生活也感覺得有些撇扭，這因為我已失去了一個帮手的原故。心裏想若是把傳令兵陳景德帶來，那該多方便呵！但是現在木已成舟，可就不成了。在無聊當中，我便去請敎於我那位老大哥商營長。「商兄，到貴營老弱殘兵連，調一名北方人給我當傳令兵，好嗎？」他聽了起先和我爭了一頓；可是，最後他還是答應了我的要求。　　我很疲乏的坐在寫字台前，心想，到了連裏總不能像在參謀處那麼隨便，尤其對新來的傳令兵，更應該拿出一點威嚴才行。對了，就是這麼辦。　　「報吿」，這北方的口音。我對他的來意已完全明白了。先扳起面孔，然後用着很生硬的口吻說聲：「進來。」　　對了，這眞是一位典型的北方風味，只是個子稍微矮一點。　　「你就是李春保嗎？」我以法官審判罪犯的風度發問。　　「是，」他很乾脆地回答，身子站得像旗桿一樣。　　「那裏人？」「河南西華縣。」「你願意當我的傳令兵嗎？」「願意。」　　我又問了一些關於他過去的事，同時我也在為他「相面」，我最怕他有反骨。最後我很關心地問道：「你為什麼要當兵？」「報吿連附，因為我的老婆被人家拐走了，所以我就當兵。」我聽到這裏，禁不住失聲而笑。在我想到「威嚴」二字時，已來不及了。於是我只得安慰了他幾聲，呌他回去收拾行李，馬上搬過來。　　起初幾天，他好像也是為了人地生疏的關係，一天到晚只是坐在我的面前聽候使喚。我看書看倦了，就望望他，他也瞪瞪眼。「好嗎？」我打破沉寂地寒暄一聲「報吿連附，很好。」他照例是這樣回答。有時我寫倦了而睡倒，等到一夢醒來，他還是坐在那裏，眞是名符其實的好伴侶。我不禁這樣讚嘆着。「你頑去呀！老是坐在這裏幹嗎？」他好像遭遇到逐客令一般地掃興而出。可是，不出一刻鍾，包險又坐在那裏。我心裏想，北方人眞的與南方人不同，像這樣馴服盡職的傳令兵，南方也許找不到。　　一天，我應友約出外游頑。晚上回來，電燈光輝下映照着地板上，狼藉不堪。於是我就對他道：「你怎麼只曉得坐，連地都不會去掃嗎？」　　「報吿連附，還只兩天沒掃呢！」他蠻有道理地回答。　　「噫！你準備幾天一掃？」　　「每個星期六掃一次，總算差不多。」我聽了眞不知是氣是憐，是怒是笑。不過我想對他生氣，罵一頓反而會把他弄得更糊塗。於是我只得以善言吿訴他，每天起碼要掃兩次。第一次是早晨，第二次就在黃昏的時候。他聽了張開着嘴，一動也不動，只是閃了幾閃眸子，好像還在做夢一樣。　　「春保，去吧，去吧，」我推了他一下又繼續道，「明天就這樣做，現在你睡覺去，沒有關係。」他稍遲疑了一下，才拖着沉重的步伐而去。他走後，我心裏總覺得天下還有這樣不開化的人，接着，我又向他寄以一番同情。眞的他實在太不懂事了。　　第二次，我回家比較晚。當我一踏進房門，就覺得室內特別淸新似的。不錯，他依然是坐在那裏。仔細看看，原來是地板洗過了。這使我非常高興。我馬上拍拍他的肩膀說：「頂好，頂好，你太辛苦了。現在什麼事都不需要你去做。你就去睡吧！」他向我來一個苦笑，很得意地揚然而去。這是我第一次看到他笑。他走後，我就很自在地寫日記。寫完，才感覺到肚子餓得荒。可不是嗎？還是十二點鍾吃的中飯。現在傳令兵是睡了，總不好再呌醒他。住在這徐家滙的鄕下，是什麼也買不到。心想，不妨阿Q一點，就算這是戰塲上好了。想到這裏，我便毫不猶豫地解衣就寝。然腹中作怪，好久不能成寐。偏偏老鼠又在那裏撞着小提鍋釘噹作響，我不奈煩地起來把鍋子擺好，可是想不到一股魚味冲鼻。這使我儼如沙漠中的旅客遇到了水源一般。於是我就重燃電燈，痛痛快快地吃起來。因為肚子實在餓，弄得連鹹味也忘記了。吃飽了又把水喝了個勁光。這樣一來，直至夜半一時，方始入夢。　　第二天早晨八點鍾，我尚在夢魂迴繞中，突然聽到傳令兵的咒駡聲。我就閉着眼睛說「不要吵哪！駡什麼呀！」　　「報吿連附，昨天給你留的魚，全被老鼠吃光了，」他埋怨地說。我曚朧聽到「老鼠」，和「魚」，心中只是好笑，「呵！呵！算了，算了，」我哼了哼說，因為我確實太倦了。可是他依然在咒駡。我覺得眞不耐煩，於是又提高了嗓子道，「不准吵，你的功勞我算知道了。」這樣一來，他才不作聲。　　過一會，他又在驚訝地說「噫！老鼠還會用筷子調羹呢？」我只不響。又過了一會，他又起勁地驚訝道；「噫！水怎麼也給喝光了？」這一下可把我氣得發昏。我不知怎的，竟如同開足了的發條一樣跳了起來，呌道；「吵什麼？吵什麼？是我吃了！是我吃了呀！」他看看風勢不對，也就不響而出。我本想再睡，但是怒火早把睡神趕走了似的，只得就此起身。起來後，我喚他進來，原想駡他一頓，聊以發洩發洩。可是當他那一本正經的可憐面孔顯露在我面前的時候，我的怒氣雲消雨散，心想，他根本太蠢了。這絕對不是他在諷刺我，更不是他在故意吵鬧我，而是他向我稱功的表示呀！於是我只得轉怒為喜地對質問道：「眞的是我吃了。難道你們河南的老鼠會用筷子調羹的嗎？」他聽了向我蠢笑了一聲，然後俄然地答道：「可是囉！我以為上海的老鼠不同呢！」我擦擦雙眼，也只得向他報以一陣苦笑。　　這是一個春天的黃昏，鮮紅的太陽浸身在一片金黃的晚霞裏。我獨自憑窗遠瞭着原野。我這淸明的心智，振奮的熱情，在春之懷抱中甦醒了過來。我正在高誦名人詩句。「可憐無定河邊骨猶是春　夢裏人……。」突然我聽到一陣隱隱的笑浪，我急回身看時，原來那就是我的傳令兵春保兄。他還是坐在那裏，除了他的面部外，還是一動也不動。　　如今他和我已經是足足半年的交情了。他曉得我並不像其他軍人那麼威嚴可怕，所以總是有說有笑他現在會為我在野外採兩枝薔薇，插在我的花瓶內，等等。許多奇奇怪怪為他演出的幽默舉動，出乎人們想像的事，使我感到一種意外的歡欣。就像昨天，他用我的魚肝油去炒雞蛋，雖然這是不恰當，但是這似乎有如同新穎的「笑話」一樣够人尋味　　是軍人，都帶有幾分「唯恐天下不亂」的不良心理。這因為軍隊駐防，確是最無聊的原故。尤其是在這生活高昂，花花世界的上海，在不能罷工沒有指數的下級幹部，更是如何地感到苦悶。幸好，我有一名戲劇性地傳令兵，而使我這苦澀之心感到新生。　　我很感謝上帝的造人，使他這樣愚蠢，否則，不但他不能當我的傳令兵，恐怕全中國願當兵的就很少。如今，他咳嗽得很厲害。據醫官說，道是肺癆二期。我是沒有力量送他進醫院，所以朋友們都勸我趕快「開缺，」否則將波及我的健康、我為這個問題思索了三天，結果那最後的決心終於有了那是——　　我要他永遠同我生長在一起，我應當盡我的所有來供給他的醫藥。這因為他是我的唯一伴侶！　　寫到這裏，他又坐在那裏對我一陣傻笑。連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（三十四）  張樂平作新聞小天地瀋陽有三怕　瀋陽有三多　　津沽航運途中，「大抓」行搶之風未殺。碼頭上「十大惡」之活動轉劇。進口輪船卸貨關棧。為苦工地痞肆意偷竊。中外商人不堪其擾。一般無知小販及婦女。亦多於上午在碼頭附近守候，收買搶偷之茶葉，凉扇，鮮果，棉紗，罐頭等物。此與上海碼頭情形相彷彿，可謂天下烏鴉一般黑。　　南京寗　路馬歇爾特使行館，月之十一日，電話發生障礙，以連日各黨派商談緊要時期，電話需用頻繁，一時致感不便，故首都電話局知悉後，趕派得力員工赴馬特使行館趕修，幷臨時添裝專線以備應用。由此亦可想見，談判現正在密鑼緊鼓聲中。　　山東有民謠曰：　　其一　　中「共」毒辣勝蛇螯　　擴「軍」禍亂造罪孽　　殘「暴」人類終有報　　多「行」不義必自斃　　其二　　解放區，不自由，共黨人士眞自由，　　百姓一舉並一動，處處感到不自由，　　共匪殺捕　淫駡，任作任為亦自由，　　不閉戶，不管妻，婦女隨便是自由。　　良善民，不自由，地痞流氓眞自由，　　百姓言語並衣食，沒有一點得自由，　　流氓胡作又胡為，吃人喝血亦自由，　　富應窮，征壯丁，上陣擋砲是自由。　　重慶海關沒收了輕磅電燈泡一千八百枚，定期在校塲口焚毁，原因是這些輕磅燈泡流入市塲以後，會增加電力的負擔，影響供電的計劃。　　北平市府於六月一日在懷仁堂招待蔣主席去　欣賞國劇。是晚九時三十二分二十秒主席夫婦由　主任吳　陪同蒞止，顧維鈞博士亦參加盛會。戲目第一　是葉盛章·　世善的「打瓜園」，第二　是小翠花，茹　　，高富遠，　盛　的「樊江關」，第三　是李少春，李世芳，艾世菊的「慶頂珠」，大勒戲「龍鳳呈祥」，則由譚富英，奚嘯伯，尚小雲，張君秋，蕭長華，孫毓堃，李多奎，葉盛闌，王泉奎，楊寳森，張春彥，哈寳山等扮演。除了預定排演的四　外，臨時還添排一　主席最喜欣賞的「華容道」。　　瀋陽有三「怕」：馬怕馬車夫，馬車夫怕警察，警察怕兵。瀋陽有三「多」：北陵的游人多，街上的馬車多，市區裏「統一接收委員會遼寗分會」的封條多。本穴世界  翰雲　　談中國最偉大的『拆字先生』　　「拆字」先生之為讀書人瞧不起，由來已久，在淸末民元之際，已被視為讀書人的末路。他們是孔乙己之流，因為沽不起酒，喫不起豆腐乾或油炸黃豆，才操這一項行業，企圖換得些沽酒之資，實在是無可奈何的事。　　眞正偉大的拆字先生，却也並非沒有；其中更不乏忠義耿介，不忘故國的志士。宋末遺民鄭所南（原名已不可考），就可以說得上偉大的拆字先生是最偉大的一個。他可並不替別人解决休咎，預測流年，却專心致力修養，效忠國家。平生坐臥，必不向北，因為這時宋已亡於元，他要表示决不屈膝事仇的决心。他的書齋，沒有什麼陳設，只在扁額上題着「本穴世界」四個大字。看到這扁額的人，不懂他的用意所在，問問他自己，也大抵是笑而不答。其實，說穿了，這正是鄭老先生的拆字本領。第一個「本」字，拆開來，可以變成「大」「十」二字。把「十」字加入「穴」字的中部，便變成「宋」字。所謂「本穴世界」，原來就是他所思念的南宋世界。他的名字所南，也就是指這個而說。他的另一個名字思肖，也無非是運用了拆字方法取「趙」字的一半「肖」字表示思念趙宋的意思。　　鄭所南不僅善於「拆字」，而且在明代崇禎間，被後人發現他還是個長於畫蘭的聖手。宋亡之後，所畫蘭花，都是露根的。當時曾有人問他：「為什麼畫蘭露根而不畫泥土？」他回答說：「我們大宋沒有領土了，被外國人奪去了呀！」　　忠義之心，溢於言詞，這是孔乙己之流絕對不可企及的地方，稱之為我國最偉大的「拆字先生」，誰曰不宜？飢餓的衡陽  風　　窗外飄着的雨洗盡了這兩天來的悶熱。到上海已經有兩天了。看到市面的繁榮和歌舞昇平的景像，不由得的使我想到半月前所到的衡陽。上海的繁榮和衡陽的災况在我心頭組成一付明顯的對照。我再也不能沉默了。　　衡陽在戰前是湖南數一數二的大商埠，除了長沙，衡陽是頂富足的。這次由於戰爭，衡陽受了光榮的傷，喪失了他原有的無所，悲慘地倒下了。我們到了衡陽市區附近時，只見斷垣殘壁，凄凉的情緒，充溢在我們每個人的心頭。　　市中心區有一條貫通南北的馬路，兩旁的鋪面全是在近日間重新建築起來的，食品店，百貨商店和綢緞店佔多數。街道的兩旁有着別的城市所鮮有的一種裝飾品，就是沿街倒臥着的災民。他們都是由四鄕來的，靑的草再也養不活他們，為了城市中可能有麵粉和稀飯領，因此扶老携幼顢預的來到了市區。我們看見他們菜色的面孔，如柴的四肢，邁着搖曳的步子，戰兢兢的捧着一個空碗。　上或手上　着一雙筷子像尖了魂的幽靈在馬路的兩旁移動着，不時有就此倒斃的…六月的太陽是灼熱的，又不時有暴雨的澆淋，久已推動了抵抗力的他們無聲息的相繼死去。每天據市政府的統計餓斃的人在二千人上下，這還只限於市區流落街頭的災民。他們連最後一個「餓」字也沒有力氣喊出來啊！　　我親眼看見一個七八歲的男孩，赤身的餓死在施粥塲和災童育幼院附近的路旁，肚子狠狠的凹進去。有一位老婦人，吿訴我，在五分鍾以前他還哭着，要求施給一些稀飯呢。我又親自看見一個壯年的男子，他的頭餓得如同小孩一般大小，由於他那長得不相稱的四肢，才使我決定他是莩，天哪這是何等可怕的災禍？　　為了想要更深的知道衡陽飢餓的情形，我們到離街市十五里左右的區域去挨戶訪問。我們訪問的是第七區，第七區共十四保，離街市近的保甲有米吃，稍離街市遠的就都以草混米而食，所有的差別就是米和草在混和的比例上有不同而已。他們所吃的草有：夏枯草，蒲公英，麻桑，艾草。我曾看見一個女孩因誤吃了毒草而嘶喊着疼痛，臉紅腫着，眼淚不住的往下流。聲音撕碎了我的心，我低聲的問着自己這，是誰的罪過啊？　　老人呑着眼淚吿訴我，他們的歲月是不長了，他們寗願早些死去啊。孩子們吿訴我，草吃久了肚子脹大，四肢無力。莊稼人吿訴我，他們有着大好的田地不能去種主要的他們沒有生產力。他們說：「先生，沒有飯吃那裏有力氣種田啊，只好讓它去荒，有甚麼辦法呢？」加之，卅四十家共用一頭牛，種子也大有問題。又有些靠着賣力氣過生的人吿訴我「先生，這個年頭有力氣也賣不到錢啊！」我又低聲的問自己，這又該如何解決呢？　　上海是富足的至少外面表示是如此，腥臭，髒污，死亡，餓斃，對上海是陌生的。不過在同一個國境中有着如上的災荒是無論如何該舉國注意的。希望各界正視救災工作。三言兩語集漢奸之家屬到底留多少生活費  武陵人　　市財政局職員嚴某，子女甚多，一家十一口，不能維持生活，投函報館，謂如有人欲為「晚景之娛」者，願將十五歲以下之子女，任擇領養；又言「諸兒資性忠厚，讀書尚能勤奮」云云。讀之令人酸鼻，以自己骨肉供人為「晚景之娛」，人間慘事，當無逾於此。處今之世，「忠厚」人到處吃虧；百無一用是書生，讀書人早已不為人所重；而嚴君似尚以為諸兒有此兩優點足堪造就，以冀人之垂靑，錯矣！　　讀出師表而不動心者，其人必不忠，讀陳情表而不動心者，其人必不孝；然則讀程監察使紏舉糧官舞弊文而無動於中者，其人亦必貪污之流？　　廣州三虎為患，不信可看新聞：（一）虎列拉曾猖獗一時，每日平均發生五十起以上；（二）街頭難民乞丐因飢餓而死者日多，掩埋隊大有「應接不暇」之勢（「囤虎」作祟，米糧價貴，自為原因之一）；（三）汽車肇禍之多，打破向來紀錄。甚矣「疫虎」，「市虎」，「囤虎」之可怕！上海亦正有此三虎為患，猖獗不亞於廣州，當局旣有滅虎、捉虎、防虎之辦法實行，但望不要做得虎頭蛇尾，則虎雖猛，亦無可施其技，使人民不再談虎色變，幸何如之。　　關於已判決之漢奸財產，其酌留家屬生活費，法無明文規定，究竟應留若干，其標準為何，法界中人對此近正紛紛討論。據蘇高院書記官長楊立棠氏稱：關於酌留標準，當視其所有財產總額及視其家屬人數及物價而定（其家屬中有能自立者除外）。其言不特仍嫌空洞，且亦不易辦理；惟有一點似已確定，即漢奸子嗣之已能自立者，應不再酌留財產以作家屬必需之生活費用，是耶？非耶？</p>

<p>春秋是與非  傅統先　　在這個人世間到底有沒有是非？這是一個很麻煩的哲學問題。照希臘古代的詭辯家說：「天下沒有客觀的眞理，但每一個人都有他自己的眞理。」莊子的齊物論也是發揮這個意見。他說：「是亦彼也，彼亦是也。彼亦一是非，此亦一是非。果且有彼是乎哉？果且無彼是乎哉？」他以為「這個」就是「那個」，那個就是「這個」。這完全是個人說話的立塲不同。假使我站在「傅某」的立塲對李某說話，那末，傅某是「我」，稱張某呌「他」。假使我站在「張某」的立塲對李某說話，那末張某是「我」，稱傅某呌「他」了。所以傅某在傅某是「我」，在張某看起來就呌「他」了。同樣張某是「我」，同時也是「他」。所以他又說：「方可方不可，方不可方可；因是因非，因非因是。」意思就是說，從這一方面說是「可以的」，但從另一方面說是「不可以的」。從這一方面說是「不可以的」，從另一方面說又是「可以的」。此以為是，彼以為非；彼以為非，此以為是。總之，是與非都是由於主觀的立塲不同，而沒有客觀的標準。　　我們同意莊子兩點：（一）行為的本身是無所謂是非的；（二）是非不是絕對的，而且相對的。但是我們認為是非並非主觀的判斷，而有一個客觀標準。　　第一點，我們說行為的本身是無所謂是非的。例如說，我肚子餓了喫飯，心裏不舒服的時候唱歌，遇見危險的境地想設法逃避。這些行為無所謂是，也無所謂非。因為我們認為道德產生於人類的社會活動，這就是說，一個人沒有先天帶來的是非道德觀念，也沒有天生，就是非的，或是的行為，是與非的行為是從人與人之間所發生的關係中產生的。　　第二點我們承認是非是相對的而不是絕對的。但是我們反對莊子把是非相對於個人的意志，我們反對希臘詭辯家以「個人為萬物這度量」的主觀相對論。我們主張客觀的相對論。因為我們認為是非觀念是對於整個社會關係的。人類的行為離開了整個社會關係便無所謂是非。社會關係也並不是固定不移的。社會關係是長期演變的結果，同時它更在不斷的向前進展。於是是非觀念也是隨着社會演變而演變的。社會關係又因不同的地域而有區分的，於是不同的地方也有不同的是非觀念。因此，是非觀念是相對於某個特殊空間時間的社會關係的。但是這是不是說在這個世界始終存在着許多不同的是非體系呢。這問題要根據整個社會進展的趨勢來決定的。從社會組織的演進方面看起來，社會關係的地域性逐漸的在消逝。原始時代個人的行為限制於部落，後來進而為封建割據，再進而為統一的國家。社會關係的擴大和社會組織的嚴密，正顯示着是非體系的一元化。　　第三點，根據以上的分析，我們知道是非的判斷並非根據於主觀的立塲而自有其客觀的標準。這個客觀的標準，就是這個逐漸在趨向於完整而嚴密的演進中的社會關係。關於是非觀念的起源，我不妨仍引用一段莊子的話，然後來加以解釋。莊子說：「可乎可，不可乎不可。道行之而成，物謂之而然。」這個「可」字，馮友蘭先生解釋為「可能」（Possibility）（見其英譯本莊子）我解釋為「可以」。孩子問媽媽說：「姑姑給我一塊糖，我可以拿嗎？」媽媽說：「可以！」孩子問：「我可以隨意拿別人的錢嗎？」媽媽說：「不可以！」我以為這個「可」字是有道德意味的。「甚麼呌可以？甚麼呌不可以？」莊子以為這是許多人的意見。大家說「可以」，這事，就可以做；大家說「不可以」，這事就不可以做。好像鄕間的道路，原來是沒有的，後來大家都在同一條綫上走過去，久之便成了一條道路。這個東西本來沒有名字的，後來大家都呌它「狗」，現在它便是一條狗了。所以莊子說：「道行之而成，物謂之而然。」足見莊子本人也承認是非是以大家的意見來做標準的。　　我們可以更進一步問：「在一片原野中何以我們大家都要走這一條路而不走別一條路呢？我個人能否標新立異，另闢途徑呢？」這答覆很簡單，因為由我們村上到那邊鎭上去，這條路綫最短。同樣，在社會上，何以我們說：「這件可以做而那件事不可以做呢？」那是因為這件事是對於大家有利的，而那件事是對於大家有害的。所以是非的產生原來是由於許多人共同的利害關係。凡足以增進共同福利的事就是對的，凡破壞共同福利的事就是不對的。所以我們可以具體的說，是非觀念是建築在整個社會的共同利害關係上的。社會上具體代表共同福利的媒介便是社會制度，因為就一個時代的人們的智力·經騐·環境看起來，這種社會制度最足以代表共同的福利。道德的判斷也就是以這種社會制度做標準的。　　根據這個標準，是與非的判斷是很明顯的了。是就是，非不非。當雙方對於是非發生爭論的時候這不外乎有四種可能性？（一）雙方都是，但這不可能，因為旣然兩方面都是以共同福利為標準的，那末他們便應該沒有爭論的餘地；（二）甲是而乙非，那末這一定是甲增進共同福利而乙破壞共同福利；（三）乙是而甲非，其理由相同；（四）甲乙全非，這是因為雙方都只顧及一部分的福利而未曾顧及整個社會全部的共同福利。現在有一種自命為公正的人們一見雙方發生爭論的時候他們不問雙方的是非，祗求雙方停止爭論。在我們看起來，眞正公正的人們應該把是的還他是，非的還他非；假使雙方都不對，他們就該指出雙方的錯誤，把眞正的共同福利擺在前面。我們要以全力支持是的一方面而阻碍非的一方面，或從共同福利的前提出發全力和兩方面的非鬥爭，務求爭取眞理，消滅私意。不然，是非不分，皂白不明，社會還是繼續的這樣混亂下去！我們認為此非全社會之福。　　至於某種社會制度是否眞正代表共同的福利，這倒是一個問題，因為在某一個時代人們限於智力經騐，或由於少數階級的偏見而產生了一種不合理的制度，不足以代表全部人民的福利，這是須要澈底的加以改革以使其合理化。關於這一點以後有機會我們預備提出來專門討論一下。　民國三十五年六月十二日給星星  張徹　　「尼亞茲」　　這意思就是「星星」　　你這以「星星」作為名字的歌　　手呵　　你那為我所聽不懂的歌曲裏　　唱出了　　戈壁沙漠中泉水樣的　　甘冽芳香的靈魂　　像泉樣淸亮的星星　　像星星樣淸亮的　　你底碧眼呵　　閃動在深陷的眼眶裏　　閃動在濃濃的眉宇下　　是在眺望嗎　　落日………　　稻田………　　蟲聲………　　每一滴水裏都有着生命的躍動的　　夏日的傍晚　　你站在綠的小土坡上　　你是不是在懷念　　你底故鄕　　你在十一歲的稚齡　　就離開了他四方飄泊的　　新疆呢　　沒有父母　　父母不知存亡　　沒有家鄕　　家鄕回不去了　　沒有好的敎養好的扶助　　你像野草樣地生長着　　而在與你同名字的　　星星的照顧下　　你生長得　　很健壯　　縱然你不知道　　音階的唱法　　你不懂得什麼是　　「節奏」這兩個字的涵義　　但你以你們那　　原始的音樂的敏感　　歌唱着　　舞蹈着　　那用你們自己的語言　　讚頌你們自己鄕土的詩篇　　而使我們驚嚇於　　你的天才　　年靑的歌手呵………　　而在你底歌聲裏　　你底手臂的舞動裏　　你底眉毛的抑揚裏　　你底碧眼的言語裏　　展開了　　新疆的　　萬古不溶的　　白頭的雪山和千里的沙漠的海洋　　和其中的綠洲　　和甜美無比的哈密的西瓜　　和紫玉樣的吐魯番的葡萄　　那是美麗的土地呀　　聽說你愛上了一位　　用「月亮」作為名字的　　蒙古的少女　　願你們把這愛擴大吧　　到了所有不同名字的　　中華民族的兄弟　　——漢·滿·蒙·回·藏………　　都像「星星」和「月亮」般　　相愛的年代　　你就可以回去了　　你就可以回去了呵　　一九四二·八·廿二·於南泉；　　一九四六·六·二·重錄舊作。　　（註）此詩作贈穆罕默德尼亞茲君，係因過去新疆內亂而流亡內地者；穆罕默德為姓氏，入內地後已更姓麥，尼亞茲，回語星辰之意。反哺  琴　　妹妹從遼遠的昆明，寄來三萬法幣，說是自己逐日積蓄下來的私房錢，特地供給母親零用的，因為妹夫的收入不很好，所以不要讓他知道了。　　聽到這個消息的時候，我的熱淚不禁奪眶而出。　　記得八年以前，妹夫在蘇州一個醫院裏任內科醫生，每月薪水七十元，二十五元寄給他的父母，他和妹妹及一個孩子住在醫院裏的醫生宿舍裏，房租水電都由醫院供給，餘下的四十五元，維持一家三口的生活。　　我的身體不好，需要長期注射針劑，為了方便起見，整個的暑假住在妹妹的家裏。　　醫院裏每天有苦力收拾屋子，為了我這個不知天高地厚的客人，不時的要呼茶喚水，妹妹化三塊錢一月的薪水僱了一個女僕，那時候米雖然便宜，也得化六七塊錢一月，不是雞和魚，便是鴨和肉，上下午還有二頓點心，飯後還要吃些水菓，每天的小菜水菓麵食之類總要一塊錢左右，每逢例假，還要陪着我逛逛虎邱，看看電影，這樣妹夫，一個月的薪水已經不够支配。　　我的注射劑已經用完，對於自身的生活向來不大關心的我，沒有預先向家裏去要錢，而注射却是不能中斷的。在一個悶熱得窒息的晚上，妹妹在她的丈夫的藥囊裏，發現了一盒我所要注射的藥劑，她表示非常高興，第二天一早，妹夫就用這一盒藥劑替我注射。我當時還怪她小氣，旣然她們藏有這種藥劑，早可以拿出來給我用了，何用在開始注射的時候，要我化六十塊錢去買呢？　　這一次的錯怪，使我永遠抱憾！永遠內疚！當我發現她的皮包裏的一張當票的時候，我慚愧得幾乎無地自容。　　之後，我才注意到妹妹自身的儉省，魚肉雞鴨之類比較貴的小菜，她老是沒有沾唇；常常推說肚子不餓，省下了一天兩頓的點心，水菓和汽水，是她做閨女的時候最喜愛的東西，現在她說是為了有孕改變了她的嗜好，我和妹夫吃水菓和汽水的時候，她坐在一旁喝着開水。　　我帶着一顆沉重的感愧無已的心，逃一般的離開了妹妹，雖然學校裏還沒有開學。　　每次妹妹歸寗的時候，總是怪瘦怪憔悴的，但是每次她總帶回來一點積蓄，讓母親替她保管　　家裏豐富的營養，把妹妹又調養得白白胖胖，在妹夫電報和快信的催促下，她最多住二個月就得離開母家。　　每年妹妹總要生一個孩子，妹夫薪水的增加，沒有家庭負担的增加來得飛快，然而孩子們的營養却是和妹妹幼年時代一樣的豐富；妹夫每天早晨的一杯牛奶和兩個雞蛋，以及飯後的水菓，始終沒有間斷過，十年來的結婚生活，賢妻良母型的性格，把個天眞活潑愉快健美的妹妹，沒有到三十歲，竟憔悴得像一個中年婦人了，妹夫却未見稍微衰老，他反而比結婚前顯得年經了。　　蘆溝橋的炮火震醒了愛好和平的全國人民，妹夫改任了航空學校的醫官，妹妹一家跟着航校由杭州遷至洛陽，又搬到柳州，終於留駐在昆明。　　烽火瀰漫下，孩子每年一個的出世，有限的薪水委實不能維持妹妹一家的生活了，妹夫不得不脫離航校，自設診所。　　在這人地生疏的異鄕昆明，業務的淸淡自在意料之中。妹妹的生活，該是怎樣的淡泊艱困，茹苦含辛！　　可是她還要積蓄三萬塊錢來寄給母親，積蓄這三萬塊錢是怎樣的不容易啊！我簡直不敢設想！　　三萬塊錢是區區之數，只够吃一頓小規模的點心。但是這區區的三萬元裏，包含着多少的辛酸，多少的艱苦！人世間的反哺之情，全在這三萬元裏發揚無遺了。　　我深深地感到人世間除了偉大的母愛之外，還有偉大的兒愛。這兩種偉大的愛，將同亙古不移的太陽的光輝一樣，永遠地永遠地溫暖着每個人的心房。家  良黻刻談詩歌朗誦  靜波　　詩歌朗誦，在西洋各國，已有着相當久遠的歷史，但在我國却不過是萌芽的時代。最近，却也正在向着康莊大道邁進，近幾月來，上海文藝晚會裏，總有幾個詩歌朗誦的節目，各大學的娛樂聚會裏，也竭力提倡着。　　在大體上講；詩歌朗誦的成績並不好，簡直有點糟，（我想這不會是太苛酷的批評。）許多曾聽過詩歌朗誦的朋友，都批評着說：「詩歌朗誦是最使人會打瞌　的節目。」　　事實上，詩歌朗誦是最高文學藝術的表現；——它像畫片，但比畫片有聲色，它像音樂，但比音樂更幽靜。　　索求詩歌朗誦不甚受人歡迎（也就是成績不甚好）的緣因，大槪可以分為二方面講：一，朗誦的技巧問題，二，朗誦的資料問題。　　一，朗誦的技巧問題；——　　在朗誦的技巧裏，更加最為重要；朗誦者喜，怒，哀，樂，複雜的情緒裏面，使聽衆能領晤到詩歌裏面的含蓄。但是，許多詩人，他們是超離了現實，生活的經騐不够，不能把握住詩歌裏的動態，只是像老太婆念經般的；沒有高低，沒有快慢，沒有………這怎能使聽者感到有興趣呢？　　再者，多數詩人只會寫；用筆寫成一首首動人的詩歌，但是他們不喜於吟哦，一旦要他們登台朗誦，慌得手忙脚亂，當然成績也就不會可觀。而多數詩人，不會講國語，甚至連土語都講不流利，要他們詩歌朗誦，南腔北調，紛然雜陳，很容易引起聽衆的嗤笑，於是，雖是一首精彩的詩歌，已就不易令人動聽了。　　二，朗誦的資料問題；——　　沒有適當朗誦的資料，詩人們縱然具備優良的朗誦技巧，也不能得到良好的成績。正像一尾腐了的臭魚，即使易牙復生，又何能使調之入味可口呢？　　一般詩人們，都像是天之驕子，彷彿不食人間煙火；成天的寫着些花呀，月呀，紅玫瑰，紫薔薇，………再不然，就是妹呀！我愛你。他們將霎那間輕煙般的靈感提住，用着極華美的字句，寫成妙品，他們自信那是最美的詩。是的，那種詩是華美的，但是，要把它朗誦給生活在現實世界裏的聽衆欣賞，那却是太不合適了。　　更有一些詩人，他們相信自己有作詩天才，不需學習，不必修改，只需將靈感順着筆尖馳騁在紙上，甚至把散文拆開來排列在紙上，也就是詩了。他們不肯自己用口讀，去檢討自己的作品。像那樣的詩，要想朗誦得使聽者為之動容，也就可想其難了。　　現在，再不妨談一點關於其解決技巧和資料問題。關於朗誦技巧的解決；詩人必須努力練習口才，學習國語，多多體騐現實生活，模倣話劇的表情，加深音樂的修養，因為詩歌朗誦像音樂一樣地訴諸直覺的，有着諧調的節奏，更能在人的心靈上刻下明確的意像，關於朗誦資料的解決；所朗誦的詩，必須能代表聽衆的心聲，與聽衆的現實生活有密切的聯繫，那麼就容易被，而引起共鳴的作用，詩的用語，必須儘可能和聽衆口語接近，而結構不太奇特，並且普遍化。　　詩歌朗誦是藝術表演的一種，但是，比其他藝術表演來得單調而不易討好。所以，要求有良好的成績，必須多多準備和修養　　最後，我祝福詩歌朗誦有着燦爛的前途，更盼望工作者的繼續努力。播種者  楊謀　　播下子種的才會有靑靑的幼苗。即使這只是一株野草，它至少可減少你庭園中不少寂寞和枯躁。　　也許這僅是一堆瓦礫，也許這是一堆砂質的鬆土；也許，威烈的太陽，討厭的連絲的雨季，把這種籽的生機毁滅掉；但是，播種呀，播下了種，才會有收穫，千千萬萬的種籽，總不會掉得千千萬萬的毁滅和死亡。好了，只要有一株，讓千千萬萬的生命寄託在它的身上，千千萬萬的生命依然活躍的生存在這世界　　把種籽向這宇宙拋灑，別悲觀說這沒有收穫，沒有代價，偉大的永亙的生命是不會有結束的，即使是星星之火，它終有一天，依舊會變為燎原的火炬的。　　假使這世界是沙漠，那你自己就是泉源。你別自餒這泉源潤濕不了多少的人類，它終將不會再使那空氣是那麼乾曠和熱燥。　　播種，一顆顆的播下去。長篇連載雙宿雙飛　五四  趙淸閣　　「媒岔兒倒有，」老闆娘看見廖老闆這次居然依了她，不禁樂得眉飛色舞，越發興奮地說；「我們回春堂的對面裁縫舖王司伕的女兒，我看見過，人生得還體面，不過十三四歲，聽說很能幹。她老子因為女兒太多，成天想嫁出去幾個作童養媳，也好減少幾份口糧。「要是你願意，讓我明天就去呌我爹作說客。」　　「裁縫司伕的女兒？」廖老闆有些猶豫地縐了縐眉頭說。「讓我再好好想看。」　　廖老闆心裏想：「自己的兒子雖不是什麼仕家子弟，但總比裁縫司伕的女兒強些！」　　「裁縫司伕的女兒怎麼樣？又賢惠，又會做針線，只不過是窮一點罷了！可是有錢人的姑娘，誰也不會給你作童養媳，我瞧你還是遷就些吧，你的兒子也不是什麼官宦之家的出身。」老闆娘又故態復萌地話裏帶刺兒了。　　廖老闆看見老闆娘不太高興，只好含糊地說：　　「哪天你把那孩子帶給我看看要得不？」　　「好，我明天就先去把那孩子帶到家裏來給你看看。」老闆娘依舊很熱心地縱踴着。「不過，我包管你會滿意的。人才好，有手藝。」老闆娘又生複了一遍說。　　果然第二天老闆娘便把那個裁縫的女兒帶來了。她呌小紅。十四歲的人還是孩子的身材，也許因為瘦的緣故，顯得更小。長的不算難看，圓臉；深眼窩；兩道細長的眉；小嘴，薄唇；但是一點血色沒有，整個面龐都是黃裏透白，像患着嚴重的貧血症。梳着一條細辮子，頭髪因貧血而脫落得稀稀疏疏。連說話的聲音也是低弱的。總之，處處表現了這孩子的不健康。　　廖老闆見過之後，心裏生了一種憐憫的感情，所以當老闆娘問他：「怎麼樣」的時候，他默默點了點頭，他在想着救治那條小生命。　　於是老闆娘馬不停蹄地又去找了她的屠伕爹爹出來作月老，裁縫司伕自然是求之不得了，講定祭灶節這天便過門。　　關於這個消息，却是寳鈴吿訴廖棟的，起初廖棟不明白是什麼意思？經寳鈴給他詳細的解釋，說：這就是替他娶小媳婦，等將來他們都長大了，便像廖老闆和老闆娘一樣，成為夫妻。　　「可是我還小，我還不到娶媳婦的時候呀！」廖棟急得　起來。　　「這個我就不知道了。」寳鈴迷茫地回答。　　寳鈴雖然比廖棟大幾歲，但對於這件事也只是一識半解。他知道娶媳婦是人生的婚姻大問題，可因為自己還沒有這種經騐，所以他迷茫。他看見過別人都是長大了才娶媳婦，為會麼廖棟這樣小就娶媳婦？他也不明白，而且奇異！他好像直覺地感到這又是一件不幸的事體，特別他聽說促成這事體的人是老闆娘，他便更覺得其中絕沒有好意。　　「怎麼辦呢？怎麼辦呢？」廖棟跺脚地嚷着。　　「　有什麼辦法？你直不理好了！反正又不見馬上呌你們成親。等你長大了再講。」寳鈴也無可奈何地安慰着廖棟。</p>

<h3>Northeast Armistice Negotiations Reach Agreement: Dispatching a Team to Mediate, Measures for Restoring Transportation Being Drafted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The 14th marks the eighth day of the effective armistice period. The armistice deadline was originally seven days. The following is a summarized report on the progress of the negotiations over the past eight days: (1) Regarding the armistice negotiations on the Northeast issue, after General Beall arrived in Nanjing to report on the actual situation of the Northeast conflict and met with Zhou Enlai twice, he was then invited by Ambassador Stuart to bring both sides together. He clearly expressed his views on the Northeast and suggested that an executive team be dispatched as soon as possible to the Northeast conflict zone to implement the armistice order, so as to prevent the war from escalating and affecting the negotiations. After several discussions, until 10:00 am on the 14th, Zhou Enlai revisited Special Envoy Marshall to conduct decisive discussions on the first item of Chairman Chiang's armistice order regarding the Northeast armistice. As a result, it is reported that an agreement has been reached to immediately dispatch an executive team to mediate based on the three points of the Northeast agreement of March 27th. According to tonight's news, this agreement does not include any attachments, so that the executive team can effectively carry out its mediation mission. (2) Regarding the negotiations on road repair and bunker removal for the restoration of transportation, Special Envoy Marshall held separate discussions with Yu Dawei and Zhou Enlai no less than eight or nine times. The three-party talks between Marshall, Yu, and Zhou also took place five times. When Colonel Hill, Chief of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, was summoned to Nanjing to report to Special Envoy Marshall on the past work experience of the transportation team and the information collected by the Executive Headquarters on the major trunk lines of the Chinese railways (including the CCP-occupied areas), and after participating in more than two transportation negotiations, this issue reached a preliminary agreement after mutual concessions between the two sides, but the content has not been announced. According to well-informed sources, although the CCP is not as insistent as in the past on removing bunkers and managing工事 in sections, it still adopts a partial reservation attitude. Minister Yu is currently rushing to draft measures for instructions, so this matter can only be said to have made progress, but the issue itself has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Qualified observers in Nanjing said that General Beall will return to Shenyang on the 15th and may bring back an armistice plan for the Northeast. Colonel Hill is now in Nanjing awaiting a plan to restore transportation to take back to Beiping. As for the need to grant Special Envoy Marshall the final arbitration power, judging from the results of recent negotiations, although it is not enough to indicate that the CCP has tacitly agreed to this, it is highly likely that the CCP will reconsider this matter. This is because the armistice deadline is approaching, and the CCP itself claims that it does not intend to delay. In summary, although the negotiations over the past eight days have not been without success, the situation in Shandong is serious. It is hoped that the CCP will refrain from further errors, and that mutual trust and concessions will lead to hope for a peaceful future.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] Beall changed his return to Ping to the 15th, then transited through Shenyang to Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The Nanjing Three-Person Conference sent a telegram to the Executive Headquarters stating that a considerable agreement has been reached on the restoration of transportation, pending only signing. The Transportation Department of the Executive Headquarters has become even busier because of this good news.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The Nanjing negotiations on the restoration of transportation have reached the stage of determining specific measures and deadlines. Huang Chenfeng, Chief of the CCP Section of the Transportation Department of the Military Mediation Headquarters, was summoned by Zhou Enlai and originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 14th, but due to bad weather, his departure was changed to the 15th. Huang is carrying various materials for the restoration of transportation. Accompanying Huang is Wu Yunfu. Wu's trip is to liaise with the UNRRA on relief issues in the CCP-controlled areas.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi Requests Dispatch of Team to Linyi: Shandong Situation May Ease, Marshall and Zhou Negotiating on Qingdao Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The current military conflict in North China may not necessarily deepen into a full-scale civil war. Today, CCP Chief of Staff Luo Ruiqing told reporters that Chen Yi telegraphed the Executive Headquarters today, requesting that the Jinan and Xuzhou teams and senior personnel from the Executive Headquarters be dispatched to Linyi to jointly discuss ways to stop the conflict. If so, there is still room for discussion regarding the military conflict in Shandong Province. Luo admitted that there are multiple conflicts in Shandong, but explained that this is retaliation by the New Fourth Army. Luo advocated that the Executive Headquarters should dispatch additional executive teams to work in Central China, because most of the current teams are in the North China area, leaving a large void in Central China, which is prone to conflict. Regarding the Yan'cheng team, where government representative Lei Fenqiang was killed, Luo said that the situation is currently under investigation. If the responsibility lies with the CCP, the perpetrators will be punished. It is reported that Luo recently went to Zhangjiakou before returning to Ping. It is understood that Luo's trip to Zhang was to conclude his original duties in Zhang and to handle personal affairs. In addition, he also discussed with the CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government how to continue transporting grain to the government to repay the loans the government made to the Hubei-Guangdong CCP army.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] According to a certain authoritative source, although the CCP claims that it has no intention of attacking Qingdao and Jinan, both places are still under siege as of today. Based on the current situation, unless the CCP voluntarily withdraws from Laifa, Dezhou, Taian, and Zaozhuang, and abandons its attempts to attack Liuhe and threaten the capital area, the overall situation is unlikely to be optimistic. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall personally asked Zhou Enlai why Dezhou and Taian were occupied after the joint armistice statement was issued, but Zhou did not give a clear answer.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The new government representative of the Jinan team, Major General Dong Zongshan, flew to Jinan on the 14th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] The CCP representative sent to Qingdao to stop the conflict was originally scheduled to fly back to the capital today to report, but due to weather conditions, he was unable to make the trip, delaying the resolution of the Qingdao crisis. CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan frankly stated: "The CCP has no intention of occupying Qingdao. I believe that once our party representative returns here, a solution can be established. That representative will probably be able to return here tomorrow." Wang also said: "The solution to the Qingdao issue is currently being negotiated by Zhou Enlai and Marshall."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Amidst the sound of the CCP army besieging Qingdao, Major General Clement, Commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, specially dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Nelson, Chief of the Intelligence Department, to fly to Linyi from Qingdao on a US Marine Corps plane at 7:00 am on the 13th, accompanied by CCP representative Hao Ding. Nelson and his party arrived in Linyi at 8:30 am and were warmly welcomed by the CCP, and met with Chen Yi, Commander of the CCP New Fourth Army. Nelson and Hao Ding flew back to Qingdao on the same plane at 7:00 pm that night. According to Chen Yi's statement to Nelson, he expressed his willingness to stop military action, but in fact, the CCP army did not stop attacking on the evening of the 13th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Lieutenant Colonel Nelson, Chief of the Intelligence Department of the US Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, carried a private letter from Chen Yi, Commander of the CCP New Fourth Army, to Major General Clement during his trip to Linyi. Clement then held a meeting with Commander Ding Zhipan of the Garrison Command on the 14th and expressed optimism about the future of the Shandong situation.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Qingdao Mayor Li Xianliang flew back to Qingdao from Nanjing at noon on the 14th and visited Commander Ding Zhipan of the Qingdao Garrison Command and Major General Clement, Commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, for a long time in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Encroaching on Foreign Strongholds, Intensifying Blockade of Jinan</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 14th] The CCP army is now intensifying its encirclement of Jinan. Its capture of Taian, Dezhou, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and other places is clearly to drive out the outer forces of the National Army, preventing them from developing outward. The blockade of materials has been intensified in recent days. The CCP army outside Jinan has gathered more than 50,000, and is still increasing. In Jinan, there are more than 20,000 between Mingshui, Puji, and Longshan, and more than 10,000 in Zaoyuansi. Wandeyi is the main force of the CCP's First Division, and there are more than 3,000 near Qihe. On the 13th, 3,000 CCP troops fiercely attacked Yan'cheng, and the situation in Jinan is extremely tense. The Provincial Assembly and various mass organizations have telegraphed the central government to call for reinforcements to be sent north. Public morale is stable, and it is believed that the central government definitely has a solution to the Shandong situation, but it is hoped that it will not be tolerated any further. Jinan City is under curfew at 10:00 pm.</p>

<h3>Executive Headquarters Discusses Military Reorganization, CCP's Troop Roster Still Not Submitted</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 13th] The Executive Headquarters' Military Reorganization Department held its second military reorganization meeting on the 10th. Those present were government representative Zeng Guanghan, CCP representative Chen Shiqu, and US representative Middleton (Davis representing).

CCP representative Chen Shiqu agreed to telegraph Yan'an for instructions. (2) Regarding the dispatch of a supervisory reorganization team, the CCP insisted that the team could be composed of two parties, that is, the team supervising the reorganization of the CCP army could be composed of the CCP and the US. The government representative insisted that the reorganization team must be composed of the government, the CCP, and the US because there was no reason not to. A. The consistent organization of the Executive Headquarters is the participation of three parties. B. The Military Three-Person Group's directive on March 16th "utilizes the Joint Executive Team". C. It is easier to ensure that the task is carried out by the participation of three parties. This issue was not resolved. (3) The CCP representative proposed that the disbandment of puppet troops and the cancellation of senior command headquarters above the military level be included in the agenda. The government representative said that the two issues had been clearly stated in the military reorganization plan and did not need to be discussed, so it was dropped. This meeting originally intended to discuss (1) the demobilization regulations, (2) the reorganization, unified compilation, and demobilization regulations, (3) the establishment of supply areas, (4) the establishment of retained troops, and (5) the issue of supply area teams and reorganization teams and establishment.

Well-informed sources said: The plan has three objectives: (1) to assist China in maintaining domestic security, (2) to assist in maintaining peace in Asia, and (3) to engage in necessary cooperation with the United Nations peacekeeping forces yet to be formed. Officials here now expect that even if Marshall's mediation fails, the training plan will still be implemented. Generally, it is believed that if mediation fails, the United States will have no other way but to fully assist the National Government in building a strong China. Well-informed official sources here said that Marshall has stationed US military officers in both the Nationalist and Communist armies. A few weeks ago, he appointed 87 US advisers to go to the CCP headquarters to assist the CCP in training its troops so that they could be incorporated into the American-trained regular army in the future.</p>
<h3>Cardinal Tien's Full Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Cardinal Tien Gengxin arrived in Qingdao by plane at 1:00 PM on the 14th. Many Catholics welcomed him at the airport. The mayor of Qingdao, Li Xianliang, accompanied him from Nanjing. Tien was originally the bishop of Qingdao, so this trip back to Qingdao will be brief, and he will soon fly to Beiping to assume his concurrent post as Archbishop of Beiping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Cardinal Tien Gengxin broadcasted to Catholics nationwide today. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>My dearest fellow Catholics across the country: By the wise arrangement of God, and through the selection of the Pope, I am able today to address you in the name of the first Chinese Cardinal, and I am extremely pleased. This joy is given to us all by God, something we have been constantly longing for since at least the Yuan Dynasty. Although I personally feel unworthy of the position of Cardinal, in order to realize the hopes of you all, and to make each of you happy, I have obeyed the Pope's command, forgetting my inadequacies, and accepted the appointment of Cardinal. I will rely on the grace of God to contribute all my energy to the Church throughout the country.</p>
<p>Today, we should thank the countless efforts of various religious orders and non-ordained missionaries, both Chinese and foreign, over the centuries. Their blood and sweat have irrigated this vineyard of God. May God reward their merits. We should also especially thank the current Pope Pius XII, who has appointed the first Cardinal in the Far East, established our Catholic Church system in China, designated the twenty ecclesiastical provinces of China, elevated twenty Chief Archbishops of the ecclesiastical provinces, and changed the Apostolic Vicariates across the country into formal dioceses. All of this is unprecedented, epoch-making, and an era-defining event in the history of the Church in China. It is also a very loving expression of the Pope towards our Church in China. How should we not be grateful? We should pray for the Pope, asking God to grant him all graces. The first Papal Representative to China, Archbishop Celso Costantini, and the current Papal Representative to China, Archbishop Antonio Riberi, have, through more than twenty years of effort, enabled the Church in China to receive such special favors and honors today. We have long known that they love China and love the Church in China, but today, with the manifestation of these facts, we have an even deeper understanding. We cannot forget Archbishops Costantini and Riberi and will always keep their deepest impression in our hearts. We should pray for them often.</p>
<p>I am not being polite or modest, I truly know that according to my personal knowledge and ability, I am definitely not worthy to be a Cardinal. However, given the vast territory and large population of China, and that it has always been a country that values ​​rites and culture, and now that the War of Resistance has been won and its international status has also improved, China is now in an important position in the world. To seek the happiness of all mankind in the world, or world peace, China is an indispensable factor. The Pope's emphasis on China, as well as the promotion of a Chinese Cardinal, is also a major reason. However, China's importance today was earned by all the people of the country and our leader Chairman Chiang through eight years of arduous War of Resistance. Therefore, we should wholeheartedly support the Central Government, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, work together with compatriots across the country to create a new China. This is also what the Pope has talked to me about many times and instructed me to convey to Catholics and non-Catholics across the country. Currently, we have not yet achieved full peace in our country, and the government is making a final effort. I hope that all Catholics across the country will especially pray for peace on the Solemnity of the Holy Trinity on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>There are too many things we need to do in the future to say them all at once, but I can say one thing to you, we are now approaching a new stage, and before us is a new situation. We must have new efforts to adapt to new needs. In other words, we must have new reforms. We can no longer be complacent and stagnate in our original state. We must move forward, taking big strides forward. All old ways of evangelization, whether in the education of priests, in the methods of running primary and secondary schools, in the planning of evangelization funds, or in the promotion of various charitable undertakings, if there are unreasonable aspects, or if they are too conservative and do not meet the needs of the times, should be abandoned without hesitation, and new methods should be sought. Of course, when reforming, we should be very cautious, obey the commands of the local bishop, and not act rashly.</p>
<p>Dear Catholics everywhere, today the Holy See has completely entrusted the Church in China to us Chinese. This is the greatest honor, but it is also the greatest responsibility. We must unite in order to fulfill our responsibilities well, otherwise our strength will be dispersed and reduced, which is very dangerous. We must follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, love each other, and in administration, although we have divided the ecclesiastical provinces for the convenience of management, that is, the Archdiocese and the Diocese, in our work, we must never have the territorial concept of the diocese. We must do things practically and strive to avoid seeking personal glory. We should give glory to God in all things, because everything we do is done through Him, for Him, and with Him. Dear fellow Catholics across the country, our responsibilities have now increased. All our staff working within the Church system, from the Chief Archbishops of each ecclesiastical province, the Bishops of each diocese, to the Apostolic Prefects of each Apostolic Vicariate, need to cooperate with all Catholics. I personally also hope to receive your suggestions, and I will carefully consider them and put them into practice. May the Holy Spirit enlighten us and guide us so that we can steadily embark on the path of building the Church and the country. I only send you the Pope's blessing. May the Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, bless all the listeners. Amen.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhenggang and Wang Maogong to Inspect Northern Jiangsu in the Coming Days. Refugee Relief Association Established in Zhenjiang</h3>

Only four counties in northern Jiangsu have not been occupied. The people who have escaped have all fallen into starvation, while those who have not escaped are still trapped in deep water and urgently need to be rescued. There are currently more than 7 million refugees in various places. Although the government has various relief efforts, they are only temporary solutions. The fundamental solution is to allow them to return to their hometowns as soon as possible and turn consumers into producers. At present, the basic force of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu is more than 30,000 people, plus about 30,000 local miscellaneous troops, totaling about 70,000 people, which is not a large number and the strength is limited, but since the ceasefire agreement was signed on January 10, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has still been attacking everywhere in Tongzhou and Haizhou. Wang also said: After the Provincial Assembly closes, he will go to various places for inspection. The local finances of Jiangsu are currently very difficult. The budget approved by the central government is only 6 billion yuan. From July 1, the finances of each county can be slightly more affluent, but the provincial finances will be even more difficult, because the land tax revenue originally belonged to the province, and in the future will only be 20%, and the other 80% will be distributed to the counties and the central government.</p>

<p>Jiaxing: Town Head Commits Suicide Due to Pressure to Collect Military Grain</p>
<p>The procurement of military grain in Jiaxing is urgently needed, but despite appeals and petitions to relevant central, provincial, and county leaders by representatives from all walks of life, the effects have been minimal. Only recently did Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie agree to advance all the funds for grain procurement, with the remainder to be paid after the autumn harvest. However, the county government, upon receiving the provincial order, issued grain certificates and dispatched personnel to supervise the collection. The town heads of various towns resigned one after another due to their inability to cope. Xu Fangxian, the town head of Shuangqiao Town in the county, was refused permission to resign and convened a meeting of wealthy households and town representatives, but no solution was found. He then secretly ingested a gold ring yesterday, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, his wife discovered it and called for medical assistance, and he is no longer in danger of death.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Reflections on the Fall of the House of Savoy</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday, citing a London dispatch, that according to an announcement by the Italian Royal Family, the Italian King has already left Rome by plane for Portugal. Last night's Rome dispatch also stated that the royal standard on the royal palace where the Italian King resided was officially lowered at 4:50 PM on the 13th. Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi has also been ordered by the cabinet to serve as acting head of state of Italy and announced the results of the plebiscite, with the people voting in favor of abolishing the monarchy. Victory belongs to the Republic, and the establishment of the Republic can be announced at any time. The bloodless revolution previously carried out in Italy has now been successfully completed. The House of Savoy was abandoned by the Italian people and had no choice but to quietly leave the country, sharing the fate of other deposed dynasties in overseas exile. This is another test of democracy.</p>
<p>From this test in Italy, it can be seen that the public's understanding of politics will definitely not be blindly followed. The general education level of the Italian people is not as high as that of Britain and the United States, and for more than 20 years, they have been under the control of Mussolini's fascism. Many people are quite concerned about the outcome of this election in Italy. What is the concern? Italy is experiencing post-war turmoil, order has not been restored, the land is barren, and the people are poor. The general public fears famine, and under these circumstances, they cannot withstand the incitement of schemers and can easily unknowingly fall into a political trap. The result will make the future of Italy itself and the whole of Europe precarious. However, the outcome of this election proves that this over-concern was unnecessary. Therefore, we should be even more convinced that, under the normal course of democracy, public opinion cannot be fabricated, and those who rely on democracy and merely chant high-sounding slogans will inevitably fail in a truly democratic setting.</p>
<p>There is also a point here that deserves our attention. That is, the Catholic Party won a great victory in this Italian general election. Generally, it was believed that the Catholic Party was a right-wing conservative party that would support the monarchy. However, while the Catholic Party won a great victory in the Italian general election, the Italian monarchy was actually defeated in this general election, and the leader who announced the abolition of the monarchy was the leader of the Catholic Party, the current Italian Prime Minister, De Gasperi, who is now serving as the acting head of state of Italy. This also shows that it is a mistaken prejudice to lump the Catholic Party together with the old-fashioned royalist party. Among Catholics, there are certainly diehards, but what the Catholic creed represents should not be stubbornness, but rather renewal that keeps pace with the times.</p>
<p>The House of Savoy has now followed the Habsburgs, the Manchus, the Romanovs, and other historical dynasties, becoming relics of history! This is an irresistible historical destiny. Since the establishment of the House of Savoy, it has driven out foreign troops, unified Italy, and established the foundation of modern Italy. Its contribution to the awakening of Italian national consciousness and the establishment of a nation-state will be recorded in history. Fair historians will naturally not erase its achievements simply because of its current demise. In the 1850s, Italy was still a geographical term, not a unified country. By taking advantage of the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War to unify Italy, the House of Savoy, which rose in northern Italy, established the foundation of the modern Italian nation-state. At that time, it was where the loyalty of the Italian people belonged, and now the fiercest supporters of abolishing the Italian monarchy are also from the birthplace of the House of Savoy in northern Italy. What an interesting contrast this is, showing how ruthless the destiny of history is. This can also give those in power, whether groups or individuals, a sincere and cautionary lesson. A government that has lost the hearts of the people, even if it has made great contributions to the country and the nation in the past, the people are not obligated to elect to retain it.</p>
<p>In 1923, Italy was in a state of economic decline and social unrest after the Great War. The Blackshirts led by Mussolini entered Rome from Milan, and the King ordered him to form a government. Mussolini's rule of Italy resulted in the Italian people suffering and ending up in their current situation. The House of Savoy naturally cannot escape its due responsibility. As a result, it was finally abandoned by the people and went into exile. This makes us think of the Japanese Imperial Family. The military and political figures who instigated Japan's aggression are certainly to blame, but the responsibility borne by the Japanese Imperial Family is also undeniable, at least not lighter than that of the House of Savoy in Italy. But we still see the Japanese Emperor going scot-free, without any sanctions. Does this mean that the Japanese Imperial Family is truly divinely ordained? To thoroughly prevent Japan from re-aggressing, we must first destroy Japan's theocratic ideology, and to achieve this goal, we must overthrow the idol of Japanese theocratic ideology—the Japanese Imperial Family. If the Japanese Emperor is still safe and sound, it will cause the Japanese people to have the illusion that he himself may be a "god," so he is eternally unchanging and cannot be overthrown. Fortunately, there is now the Allied Control Council for Japan, and the Emperor's rule is still subject to the control of the Allied Supreme Commander. Looking at the fall of the Italian monarchy, we must ask: when will we be able to invite the Japanese Imperial Family to the historical museum as well?</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Reopens Today; Byrnes and Others Arrive in Paris One After Another Yesterday; Soviet Radio Attacks US Policy Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's News] London, 14th Broadcasting: US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Paris one after another this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also arrived shortly afterwards. The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened as scheduled tomorrow afternoon, starting with a discussion of the conference agenda.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] US Secretary of State Byrnes and Senators Connally and Vandenberg flew to Paris on the presidential plane "Sacred Cow" at 5:20 PM today to attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. President Truman personally went to the airport to see them off and wished them a "safe journey." This is unprecedented in American history, and diplomatic circles believe that this move is of great significance, showing the deep concern of the United States for European issues. Before Byrnes and others boarded the plane, they took a photo with President Truman and their wives. Byrnes jokingly said to the President, "Why don't you take this plane to Paris and meet with us?" The President, seeing these three politicians leave the country, seemed to have some feelings and replied, "Yes, I will go to Paris to meet you." Another report from Paris: the 36-member Soviet delegation arrived in Paris today afternoon from Smolko.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to Paris by plane this afternoon. About 60 staff members had arrived in France before Bevin.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] The US delegation to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference arrived here tonight. According to a certain representative, Secretary of State Byrnes will firmly uphold the established policy of the United States at the conference and will not compromise on various disputes regarding the treaties with European countries. What is unknown is whether Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov can refrain from being stubborn? If he continues to be self-isolated, this conference will inevitably end without results in a short period of time. The representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have today completed the drafting of the report, including all the points of disagreement, which will be submitted to the respective Foreign Ministers for review on Saturday. After the last meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, representatives were appointed to continue the meeting, trying to reduce major disputes to minor ones and minor ones to none. However, up to now, only concrete agreements have been reached on minor points on which the Four Foreign Ministers have already agreed in principle. The Four Foreign Ministers are scheduled to hold their first meeting on Saturday, at which time they will only decide on the agenda. The pending issues to be discussed thereafter include the issue of sovereignty over Trieste in the Italian treaty and the issue of Soviet troops stationed in Bulgaria. The future of Germany is the fundamental issue of the overall European situation. Byrnes also intends to submit the Austrian issue for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] On the eve of the Quadripartite Conference, Moscow Radio launched a satirical attack today on US policy in the Far East and Latin America, accusing the United States of wanting to control the military strength of Latin American countries and claiming that the decision-makers of US policy are seeking unconditional preferential rights in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk today. Officials did not disclose the content of the talks, but well-informed sources said that the two discussed the Czech request to cede four districts of Silesia in the Prussian province, which, according to the Potsdam Declaration, are under the jurisdiction of Poland.</p>
<h3>Connally's Remarks: The United States Will Firmly Oppose Attempts to Control the World</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] Connally delivered a televised speech after boarding the plane, frankly considering the possibility of failure of the Paris conference. In his speech, he reiterated his condemnation of the "group" policy, opened up avenues for continued negotiations in the world, and proposed convening a 21-nation conference to deal with pending issues if the Paris conference fails. Connally said: If the Paris conference fails, governments can sign separate agreements. It is inconceivable that the veto of one of the foreign ministers will hinder the restoration of peace. In short, any attempt by a single country to dominate the world is firmly opposed by the United States.</p>
<h3>Socialism and Communism: Blum Says They Can Never Merge</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Plymouth, England, 13th] Blum, the leader of the French Socialist Party, recently spoke to the British Labour Party Congress on behalf of socialists throughout Europe, especially Western Europe, stating: Socialism and Communism cannot merge at this time, nor can they merge in the future, until all Communist parties believe in the sincerity of democracy and their independence and autonomy from Soviet policy no longer cause doubt. The Communist Party borrows the name of democracy, and the Catholic Democratic Party borrows the name of socialism, competing with each other for the entire population of Europe and capitalism, thus dividing them into three groups. If a one-party government is to be established, it is virtually impossible. The only possibility is for the Socialist Party and the Communist Party to merge and establish a proletarian government, but I oppose such a merger. I am also saddened by the instability of domestic politics in various countries, which causes power and responsibility to circulate among the three parties. This is the current situation in France.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Plymouth, England, 13th] Blum spoke at the British Labour Party annual meeting today as a comrade, and the entire venue responded with warm applause. When he mentioned that the policies of the French Socialist Party and the British Labour Party "do not completely coincide," the applause was even louder. It is said that "on the Spanish issue, the French have different opinions from you" is an example of the difference between the policies of the French Socialist Party and the British Labour Party.</p>
<h3>Truman Visit to Soviet Union: White House Absolutely Denies</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 13th] The White House today referred to the London newspaper's claim that if the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference does not achieve the expected results, President Truman may visit Moscow to meet with Stalin as "pure speculation."</p>
<h3>US Republican Congressmen: Accuse of Money Diplomacy; Using the Export-Import Bank as a Tool</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] At a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee today, Republican Congressmen Jensen and Bolleaux spoke out, accusing the Export-Import Bank, the largest tool of the government's money diplomacy policy, of becoming a means of avoiding congressional approval of foreign loans. The two Congressmen also criticized other state-run companies that are not subject to congressional oversight.</p>
<p>[The news item "US House of Representatives Passes Loan Bill to Britain" published in this newspaper yesterday omitted the words "Banking Committee" due to unclear reception at the time of recording. This is corrected here.]</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 13th] Foreign Liquidation Commissioner McCabe announced today that the US has signed a loan agreement with the Finnish government, extending a loan of US$5 million (in addition to the US$10 million loaned earlier this year) to purchase US surplus goods in Europe.</p>
<h3>UN Assistant Secretary-General Proposes Using Economic Sanctions to Deal with Potential Aggression</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, New York, 13th] UN Assistant Secretary-General Laugier proposed on the 10th that the UN create a civilian agency to study the use of economic sanctions to deal with potential aggressors. The proposed new agency will become a civilian agency counterpart to the UN Military Staff Committee.</p>
<h3>British Empire Should Implement Zonal Defense System</h3>
<p>Recommendation by Former British Commissioner to the Middle East</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] Sir Gilbert Clayton, former British Commissioner to the Middle East, proposed today that the British Empire should be divided into zones to ensure national defense security. Britain is a major part of the regional defense system, with each dominion separately controlling its sphere of influence. Western Europe and the Middle East are the responsibility of Britain, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific are the responsibility of Australia and New Zealand, and the defense of Africa is the responsibility of the Union of South Africa. The defense plan for North America is the simplest.</p>
<h3>Italian King Reluctantly Leaves Homeland; Well-Wishers at Airport Burst into Tears</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] When King Umberto of Italy boarded the plane to Portugal today, Associated Press reporters witnessed men and women seeing him off, bursting into tears and repeatedly shouting goodbye. Umberto, however, often smiled and finally shook hands with reporters to say goodbye. After all ten people traveling with him had entered the plane, he also boarded the plane. Minutes after the royal palace announced that Umberto was "flying directly to Lisbon," another message was issued stating that the plane would stop in Madrid so that the Italian Ambassador to Spain, Scotti, could disembark.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 13th] The Italian King left Beijing by private plane. Before his departure, the driver refused to drive for him, preferring to die rather than exile the King to a foreign country, so another driver was substituted. Prime Minister De Gasperi and members of the royal family saw him off at the airport. The plane carrying the Italian King, protected by four Allied fighter planes, flew around the city for a week before flying west.</p>
<p>Leaves Declaration Before Departure; Protests Against Illegal Actions of Cabinet</p>
<p>Before leaving the country, the Italian King left a declaration, requesting that it be published at 10:00 PM that day. The content emphasized the King's intention to avoid civil strife. It stated in brief: "Before the Supreme Court announces the results of the referendum, I believe that the King has the right to retain his position. However, in violation of the law and national sovereignty, the cabinet took unilateral and arbitrary action last night to seize power, forcing me to choose between submission and bloodshed. The Italian nation has just been rescued from the Great War, and the borders are threatened. My people have already suffered greatly. I will do everything within my power to prevent them from suffering again. The judicial power of Italy has always been independent and free, becoming the glorious tradition of Italy. I believe that it will be able to act freely. I do not want to use force to resist injustice, nor do I want to sit idly by and watch the illegal actions of the government. I can only leave my homeland and make a sacrifice for the greatest benefit of my homeland. Therefore, in the name of the people and the King, I protest against this atrocity. Long live Italy!"</p>
<h3>Regarding the Spanish Issue: US Proposes Compromise; Soviet Representative Objects; Decision Postponed Until Next Week</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Soviet Representative to the UN Security Council Gromyko today criticized the US proposal to refer the Franco problem in Spain to the UN General Assembly for discussion. Gromyko said: If the Council accepts this US proposal, it will create a dangerous precedent, meaning that the Security Council has "evaded its responsibilities." At today's meeting of the Security Council, Moromiko completely disagreed with the amendment to the Spanish issue but did not exercise his veto power. The meeting decided to temporarily adjourn until 7:30 PM next Monday.</p>

<h3>US Army Stationed Abroad: Currently Still 800,000; 5,000 Remain in Our Country</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] According to the Army Department's annual report, a large number of US Army personnel were dispatched to various countries to assist in combat during the war. Now that the war has ended, US troops are being demobilized and returning home one after another. From December 1941 to September 1945, the US Army dispatched 7.3 million personnel to overseas combat, carrying equipment totaling 126,859,000 tons. Currently, there are 350,000 US troops stationed in Germany, 200,000 in Japan, and only 250,000 scattered in other locations. The Army Department plans to reduce the number of Army personnel to 1.55 million by the first of next month, of which 797,000 will be stationed abroad. The current mission of these US troops is merely to maintain traffic, take care of war brides, dispose of surplus assets, comfort displaced people, and perform other peaceful occupation tasks. As for the US troops in the UK and Scotland, which once numbered 1.5 million, only 4,500 remained last month. Today, in fact, no US troops are stationed in the UK anymore.</p>
<p>In the China-India-Burma Theater, the US military reached a maximum of 250,000 at the end of the war, of which 175,000 were in the India-Burma Theater and 75,000 in the China Theater. There are now only 400 US troops in India and Burma, and the rest have been demobilized and returned home or transferred to other theaters. These 400 people will continue to be responsible for clearing surplus materials.</p>
<p>The China Theater was declared closed on May 1st, and no US combat troops remain in China. However, Marine Corps Air Force and ground troops remain in North China. According to Army statistics, there are currently 5,000 US soldiers remaining in China. US military supplies in China have been sold to China for 67 million yuan, about 50% of the original value.</p>
<p>In Korea, US troops landed in Korea on September 8 last year, totaling three divisions. Two divisions are currently stationed in the area south of the 38th parallel in Korea, and the 40th Division has been demobilized and returned home. However, the exact number of US troops in Korea is still unknown. US troops will not withdraw from Korea until a government is established in Korea in accordance with the Moscow Tripartite Agreement.</p>
<p>In Japan and the Pacific, the US military totaled 1,690,000 on October 1 last year. There are now 393,000, including the occupying forces in Japan.</p>
<p>The Pacific Air Force once had 196,000 personnel and 5,500 aircraft, but now there are only about 50,000 personnel left.</p>

<h3>U.S. Engineers Committee Suggests Disarming Japanese Industry, Aims to Eliminate its Combat Potential</h3>
<p>Far Eastern Commission Approves a Portion of Japanese Industry for Reparations</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 13th] After seven months of research, the National Engineers Committee of the United States has submitted a seven-point plan regarding the disarming of Japanese industry to the Secretary of State and the Secretaries of the Army and Navy, which was announced yesterday by the Department of the Army. The committee recommends prohibiting: (1) the nitrogen synthesis fixation method, (2) the manufacture of synthetic liquid fuels, (3) the manufacture of lead and magnesium, (4) the use of nuclear energy. It also recommends restricting (1) the production of sulfuric acid and calcium carbide, (2) the productivity and output of steel mills and steel product factories, and (3) the productivity and output of copper mills. The report points out: "Completely eliminating Japan's industry and making its entire population rely solely on agriculture and fishing is practically impossible, and world opinion would not support such action." At the same time, the report states that a plan must be developed to "control Japan's war potential, even after the army occupation ends." Another goal of the committee's recommendations is to allow Japan's non-combat potential to develop safely in the form of free investment. The committee's recommendations for controlling the fuel industry are extensive, and the committee recommends creating a fuel control system to ensure that Japan's fuel supply is equal to the needs of Japanese industry. For Japanese scientific research, the committee only offers a simple solution: dismantle laboratories used for wartime purposes and prohibit the establishment of any scientific research institutions, as these institutions could potentially be converted for military use. In addition, special attention is paid to prohibiting any research related to the manufacture of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 13th] Yesterday, the Far Eastern Commission approved a policy statement on the temporary removal of Japanese industry as reparations, including the steel industry, thermal power industry, soda ash industry, chlorine gas, and caustic soda industry. Committee Chairman McCoy told reporters yesterday that the committee has completed action on all industries listed in the report of the U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley to the President regarding the plan for temporary reparations removal from Japan. However, he pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission's reparations subcommittee is currently considering recommendations for the temporary removal of other industries (not included in the Pauley report).</p>

<h3>Industry Has Reached the Brink of Total Collapse, Ten Factories Have Closed Down, Many More are Applying for Permission to Close, All Industries are Considering Layoffs and Salary Cuts, When Will the Production Conference Be Held?</h3>
<p>According to Zhao Banfu, Director of the Social Labor Department: the industrial crisis has been worsening in recent days. Factories in various industries are facing pressure from wages, interest rates, and the import of foreign goods, and have begun to show signs of total collapse. Currently, the department has records of ten factories that have closed down. Two more factories have requested permission to close down, and three factories have requested to lay off employees and cut salaries. Such situations are increasing daily. If measures are not taken to remedy the situation, the total collapse of the national economy is imminent. To remedy this crisis, Zhao proposed two suggestions: (1) The government should provide unlimited industrial loans at low interest rates. (2) Coordinate labor-management disputes and strictly crack down on illegal acts such as violence and coercion.</p>
<p>Further report: Yesterday, reporters interviewed leaders from various industries to inquire about the production situation in their respective industries. Summarizing their talks, the following points were made: (1) There is a shortage of raw materials, and costs are too high. (2) Wages account for 25% of the total cost, increasing costs. (Before the war, it only accounted for 5% of the total cost.) (3) Interest accounts for 20% of the total cost. If calculated from the time raw materials are purchased to the time finished products are sold, it takes two months, and the interest accounts for 40% of the total cost of the finished products. (4) Foreign goods are pouring in, and domestic products cannot compete with them. Therefore, currently, various industries are considering layoffs, salary cuts, tightening operations, and closing down. It is reported that one-third of the knitting factories in this city have already stopped production, and the remaining two-thirds are considering closing down. Various industries hope that the production conference can be convened as soon as possible to save private industry from disaster.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Workers from the No. 2 Gongda Factory Appeal, Most Workers Returning from the Rear Area Have Fallen Ill</h3>
<p>[Our report] Unemployed workers from the No. 2 Gongda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu hosted reporters yesterday. According to the report: The No. 2 Gongda Cotton Mill had a total of 52,000 spindles before the war. After the Pearl Harbor incident, the Japanese transported most of the factory's machinery to the British-owned Louchang Factory in Pudong. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the Louchang authorities seized the machinery. The Gongda workers submitted a document to the Social Bureau, which transferred it to the Louchang authorities for negotiation, but to no avail. As a result, Gongda could not resume operations, and 1,656 workers were unemployed. Currently, the unemployed workers of Gongda have two demands: (1) They hope that the Louchang authorities will provide relief and return the Gongda machinery that belongs to our country. (2) They hope that the government can gather the empty spindles from various factories and open cooperative factories. The workers only ask to have enough to eat, and use the surplus wages as capital for the factories.</p>

<p>Father and Three Sons Tragically Died by Poison</p>
<p>Wang Zihun Could Not Help But Be Ruthless</p>
<p>He Poisoned Two Children Before Committing Suicide</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zihun, a 22-year-old youth residing at No. 1, Alley 225, Jin Shenfu Road, was married to Yao Shijuan (20 years old) and had two sons, the eldest named Xianlin, three years old, and the youngest named Didi, who had just turned one month old.

<p>Before and After Rong Yongming's Arrest</p>
<p>Visiting Wuchang Rice Store and Discussing Rice Business with Rice Merchants</p>
<p>Rong's Wife Cries, Saying She Has Done Nothing Wrong</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The summons of Rong Yongming of Wuchang Rice Store was the first decisive move by the authorities to address the serious rice crisis in the city, which aroused great attention from all sectors at the time. However, after the exposure of the inside story of the grain loan case, Rong Yongming's case seemed to have become a small ripple in comparison. Advertisements appeared in the newspapers from fifty-six grain merchants and Rong Yongming's family, calling for justice. The reporter wanted to find out the truth and visited Rong's family and Wuchang Rice Store in person.</p>
<p>Wuchang Rice Store rents two rooms upstairs at No. 22, Guizhou Road. The office is no different from a regular office. Several partners in the store, hearing that the reporter had arrived, seemed to have been given a chance to appeal, filled with grievances, eager for the reporter to swallow them whole.</p>
<p>Talking about the incident on May 23, they said: Rong Yongming did not raise the market price of early rice to 55,000 yuan that day. In fact, Wuchang sold fifty dan of early rice at a market price of 51,500 yuan that day. The buyers were Yingji, Yuanyuan, Rendagong, and Yufeng Rice Stores. All of this can be verified by the accounts.</p>
<p>Rong Yongming was summoned on the afternoon of May 23, and Wuchang's account books were taken away with him. After the authorities questioned him, Rong Yongming provided a guarantee from Wanshengxin Sauce Garden and returned home that day. It is said that the next day, the authorities sent four accountants to work with Chen Zuobin, the accountant of the store, and took the store's account books to the relevant rice stores and customers for verification one by one, and nothing unusual was heard. On May 31, the authorities summoned Rong Yongming again, saying that he was going to retrieve the account books, but he never returned. On the 10th of this month, it was heard that he had been sent to the Garrison Headquarters. However, since Rong Yongming was detained for the second time, Wuchang has temporarily closed, and the firms and businesses that deal with Wuchang have been ordered to freeze their accounts with Wuchang.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 12, Chen Zuobin, the accountant of the store, was summoned again. It is said that after the authorities checked the store's account books, they discovered that the store had earned illegal commissions of 1.8 million yuan from May 1 to May 23, and ordered that the full amount be paid immediately to be used for charitable purposes, otherwise, people would be detained. People in Wuchang said: The manager has been detained, and the bank accounts have been frozen, so where would the cash come from? Moreover, currently, the commission for selling rice on behalf of customers is 1,000 yuan per dan, but sometimes the goods have not been sold, and the entrusting customers urgently need money to buy rice in the producing areas, and they are often willing to depreciate the price for the rice store to advance the money to buy. Once the rice store has bought it, it is its own goods. Profits and losses depend entirely on the market price fluctuations. For example, in April, due to the frequent downward trend of rice prices, more than one million yuan was lost. In May, rice prices rose, and sometimes each dan earned five or six thousand yuan, which is also a fact. From the beginning of this year to the present, a total of more than four million yuan has been earned. However, the two million yuan at the beginning of the year could buy 200 dan of rice, and now the principal and interest add up to more than six million yuan, which is only enough to buy more than 120 dan of rice. How can there be the ability to hoard 2,000 bags of rice? From this ratio, the profits simply do not make up for the losses, so it seems that one cannot simply look at the profit side and ignore the loss side.</p>
<p>The case has not been concluded yet. When the reporter went to visit Rong's family again, in an old-fashioned residence on Fuxing East Road, he met Rong Zhou, who had published an advertisement in the newspaper to appeal for her husband. She looks like a typical housewife, with an old mother, two sons, and two daughters. As a tenant of three rooms, she rents a whole floor from someone else. She sobbed and didn't know where to start. She said: The whole family depends on Rong Yongming for a living, and recently two more children have been sick, and Rong Yongming has never done anything wrong in the past. She hopes that he can be cleared of injustice and return soon… The reporter was at a loss, and could only echo: Those who have done nothing wrong will be cleared of injustice soon.</p>
<p>Reaching the way back, the case of Rong Yongming of Wuchang Rice Store still raised a big question mark in the reporter's mind? We don't ask who it is, we must find out the truth, who is the real culprit in the entire rice wave? Finally, the reporter has to borrow the words of a powerful person: "Investigate and handle impartially"!</p>
<p>Robbing a Bride</p>
<p>Ju Zhuzhu Cries for Help</p>
<p>The Groom Is Too Impatient</p>
<p>The Parents-in-Law Become Foes</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Rusheng, a resident of Nianjiu No. 9, Zhenxiu Branch Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, from Nantong, has a son named Renfa, 23 years old. In February of this year, he was engaged through a matchmaker to Ju Wang, a Ningbo native, whose daughter Zhuzhu (22 years old) lived at No. 8, Hujia Alley. Recently, young relatives have been visiting the home frequently, and Renfa has felt very uneasy, fearing that if things go on for too long, something will happen. Therefore, Rusheng chose a wedding date and entrusted the matchmaker to formally marry the bride. However, Zhuzhu replied that the wedding would have to wait until three years later. This made the Zhang family even more suspicious. At about 10 o'clock last night, they invited the matchmaker and others to take decisive action and forcibly rob the bride. First, they broke into the house and beat the mother and daughter. Then, they carried Zhuzhu away. When they passed the Pudong Patrol Team of the City Fanli Garrison Department, the guard at the gate heard cries for help and saw a group of people carrying a woman. Fearing something unexpected, he led the team to question them and learned the inside story. However, the act of robbing the bride was a restriction of freedom, so he sent a letter to the Yangjing Branch for investigation. The two sides insisted on their own versions, and there was no way to reconcile. Today, they were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 8:45 last night, while the Chinese Grand Theater on Niuzhuang Road was showing "The Flying Guillotine", fifteen or sixteen young soldiers suddenly arrived to watch the play.

<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in this city] Education Minister Zhu Jiahua flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 5 p.m. on the 13th to attend the board meeting of the Sino-British Education and Culture Fund. The Central News Agency reporter visited him yesterday and raised various education issues. Mr. Zhu's answers were as follows: (1) To adjust the treatment of educational personnel, the Ministry is making its best efforts. Because it involves a wider range, it can only slightly increase the research funding for fire school first. (2) For the demobilized young soldiers, the Ministry of Education has sent them back to their original schools for reinstatement in accordance with the established procedures. (3) In order to handle study abroad education and general cultural liaison matters, the Ministry of Education will set up cultural counselors in the embassies of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France.

(7) The Fourth National Education Conference is scheduled to be held this autumn. (8) In order to develop national physique, attention should be paid to physical training in the future.

<p>Free Talk - Creating Mania - Shao Fu</p>
<p>It is said that municipal construction has various grand plans again.</p>
<p>What with building large bridges over the Huangpu River, and underground trams... Shanghai isn't up to par with the scale of New York, London, or Paris, it's certainly a bit undignified.</p>
<p>We ordinary citizens are naturally happy to hear such good news. But after being happy, when we turn our heads to think again, we feel a sudden loss. Why is that? For example, the handling of night soil still relies on the "night soil collectors", most of the trams don't stop at Yokohama Bridge or Haining Road, the asphalt roads are covered in scars, hawkers fill the sidewalks, the Suzhou Creek stinks to high heaven... I have no profound theories, just want to be pragmatic. We only hope that the roads can be leveled, the garbage swept clean, that the monstrous cars stop rushing around in the city, and that more trams and buses are available. We would be satisfied with just that.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that building a new road is easier to show results and gain favor than repairing a broken one. So, officials, whether new or old, all have a "creation mania." Thus, new roads increase daily, while old roads become more dilapidated daily. Many people say that the affairs of officials can often be viewed in this way. Frankly, what we need is a group of practical fools who will enrich and perfect the existing work first. If there is energy to spare, then we can think about great achievements.</p>
<p>Because beggars are not interested in German steak or Italian pasta.</p>
<p>My Orderly - Ju Yin</p>
<p>Last winter, I was suddenly ordered to transfer from headquarters to serve in the artillery battalion. When I arrived at the company, I was surrounded by a group of strangers. Not only was I unaccustomed to the environment, but I also felt somewhat awkward in my daily life. This was because I had lost a helper. I thought to myself, how convenient it would be if I could bring my orderly, Chen Jingde! But now, what's done is done, and it can't be done. In my boredom, I went to consult my old brother, Battalion Commander Shang. "Brother Shang, could you transfer a Northerner from your company of old, weak, and disabled soldiers to be my orderly?" He argued with me at first, but in the end, he agreed to my request.</p>
<p>I sat wearily at my desk, thinking that I couldn't be as casual in the company as I was in the staff office, especially with the newly arrived orderly. I should put on a bit of an air of authority. Yes, that's what I'll do.</p>
<p>"Report!" came the Northern accent. I understood his purpose completely. First, I put on a stern face, and then said in a very stiff tone, "Come in."</p>
<p>Yes, this was indeed a typical Northerner, just a little short.</p>
<p>"Are you Li Chunbao?" I asked with the demeanor of a judge examining a criminal.</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied crisply, standing as straight as a flagpole.</p>
<p>"Where are you from?" "Xihua County, Henan." "Are you willing to be my orderly?" "Willing."</p>
<p>I asked him some questions about his past, and at the same time, I was "reading his face." I was most afraid that he would have a rebellious bone. Finally, I asked him with concern, "Why did you join the army?" "Reporting, company commander, because my wife was abducted by someone, so I joined the army." When I heard this, I couldn't help but burst out laughing. I didn't have time to think about "authority" anymore. So I had to comfort him a few times and tell him to go back and pack his luggage and move over immediately.</p>
<p>In the first few days, it seemed that he was also unfamiliar with the place, and he just sat in front of me all day waiting for orders. When I was tired of reading, I would look at him, and he would stare back. "Okay?" I asked to break the silence. "Reporting, company commander, very good." He replied as usual. Sometimes I would fall asleep when I was tired of writing, and when I woke up, he was still sitting there, truly a good companion. I couldn't help but praise him. "Go and play! What are you doing sitting here all the time?" He seemed to have encountered an eviction notice and left disappointedly. But in less than a quarter of an hour, he would be sitting there again. I thought to myself, Northerners are really different from Southerners. I probably wouldn't find such a docile and conscientious orderly in the South.</p>
<p>One day, I went out with friends. When I came back in the evening, the floor was a mess under the electric light. So I said to him, "Why do you just know how to sit there? Can't you even sweep the floor?"</p>
<p>"Reporting, company commander, it's only been two days since I swept!" he replied reasonably.</p>
<p>"Oh! How often do you plan to sweep?"</p>
<p>"Once every Saturday should be about right." When I heard this, I didn't know whether to be angry, to pity him, to be angry, or to laugh. But I thought that getting angry at him and scolding him would only confuse him more. So I had to tell him gently that he had to sweep at least twice a day. The first time was in the morning, and the second time was at dusk. When he heard this, he opened his mouth and didn't move, just blinked a few times, as if he was still dreaming.</p>
<p>"Chunbao, go, go," I pushed him and continued, "Just do it like that tomorrow. You can go to sleep now, it doesn't matter." He hesitated for a moment before dragging his heavy steps away. After he left, I couldn't help but feel that there were still such uncivilized people in the world. Then, I felt a sense of sympathy for him. He really didn't understand anything.</p>
<p>The second time, I came home later. As soon as I stepped into the room, I felt that the room was particularly fresh. Indeed, he was still sitting there. Looking closely, I realized that the floor had been washed. This made me very happy. I immediately patted him on the shoulder and said, "Great, great, you've worked too hard. You don't need to do anything now. Just go to sleep!" He gave me a wry smile and left triumphantly. This was the first time I had seen him smile. After he left, I wrote in my diary with ease. After I finished writing, I felt very hungry. Wasn't it true? I had lunch at twelve o'clock. Now that the orderly was asleep, I couldn't wake him up. Living in this rural area of Xujiahui, I couldn't buy anything. I thought to myself, I might as well be a little like Ah Q and pretend that this was the battlefield. Thinking of this, I took off my clothes and went to bed without hesitation. But my stomach was grumbling, and I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Then, the rats were banging on the small tin pot, making a clanging noise. I got up impatiently and put the pot away, but unexpectedly, I was hit by a fishy smell. This made me feel as if a traveler in the desert had found a water source. So I relit the electric light and ate heartily. Because I was so hungry, I even forgot the saltiness. After eating my fill, I drank all the water. As a result, I didn't fall asleep until one o'clock in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock the next morning, I was still in a daze when I suddenly heard the orderly cursing. I said with my eyes closed, "Don't make so much noise! What are you cursing about?"</p>
<p>"Reporting, company commander, the fish I left for you yesterday was all eaten by the rats," he complained. I vaguely heard "rats" and "fish" and couldn't help but laugh. "Ha! Ha! Forget it, forget it," I hummed, because I was really too tired. But he was still cursing. I felt really impatient, so I raised my voice and said, "Don't make so much noise! Your credit is noted!" This time, he stopped talking.</p>
<p>After a while, he said in surprise, "Hey! Rats can even use chopsticks and spoons?" I just didn't respond. After another while, he said in surprise again, "Hey! How did the water get drunk up too?" This time, I was so angry that I fainted. I don't know why, but I jumped up like a fully wound spring and shouted, "What are you shouting about? What are you shouting about? I ate it! I ate it!" He saw that the situation was not good and left without a word. I wanted to sleep again, but it seemed that the fire of anger had driven away the sleeping god, so I had to get up. After I got up, I called him in. I originally wanted to scold him to vent my anger. But when his serious and pitiful face appeared in front of me, my anger dissipated. I thought to myself, he's just too stupid. This is definitely not him satirizing me, let alone him deliberately making noise to disturb me, but a way for him to show off his contribution to me! So I had to turn my anger into joy and asked, "It was really me who ate it. Do the rats in your Henan know how to use chopsticks and spoons?" He gave me a silly smile and then suddenly replied, "That's right! I thought the rats in Shanghai were different!" I rubbed my eyes and had to give him a wry smile.</p>
<p>It was a spring dusk, and the bright red sun was soaking in a golden sunset. I was leaning on the window alone, gazing at the wilderness. My clear mind and enthusiastic passion were awakened in the embrace of spring. I was reciting famous poems aloud. "Pitiful are the bones by the Wu-ting River, still dreaming of spring..." Suddenly, I heard a faint wave of laughter. When I turned around, I saw that it was my orderly, Brother Chunbao. He was still sitting there, and other than his face, he was still motionless.</p>
<p>Now, he and I have been friends for a full six months. He knows that I am not as stern and scary as other soldiers, so he is always talking and laughing. He now knows how to pick two roses in the wild for me and put them in my vase, etc. Many strange and humorous actions that he performs, things that are beyond people's imagination, make me feel an unexpected joy. Just like yesterday, he used my cod liver oil to stir-fry eggs. Although this is inappropriate, it seems to be as thought-provoking as a novel "joke."</p>
<p>Soldiers all have a bit of a bad mentality of "fearing that the world won't be chaotic." This is because it is really boring to be stationed in the army. Especially in this Shanghai, where the cost of living is high and the world is full of temptations, how can the lower-level cadres who cannot strike and have no cost of living adjustments not feel depressed? Fortunately, I have a theatrical orderly, which makes my bitter heart feel new.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to God for creating him and making him so stupid. Otherwise, not only would he not be able to be my orderly, but I am afraid that very few people in all of China would be willing to be soldiers. Now, he has a very bad cough. According to the medical officer, he has stage two tuberculosis. I don't have the ability to send him to the hospital, so my friends are advising me to quickly "fire" him, otherwise it will affect my health. I have been thinking about this problem for three days, and finally I have made a final decision.</p>
<p>I want him to live and grow with me forever. I should use all that I have to provide him with medicine. This is because he is my only companion!</p>
<p>As I write this, he is sitting there giving me a silly smile.</p>

<p>This World of Mine - Han Yun</p>
<p>Talking about China's Greatest "Character Dismantler"</p>
<p>The profession of "character dismantling" experts has long been looked down upon by scholars. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, it was already regarded as the last resort for scholars. They were like Kong Yiji, and only took up this profession to earn some money for drinking because they couldn't afford wine, dried tofu, or fried soybeans. It was a truly helpless thing.</p>
<p>However, there have been truly great "character dismantling" experts. Among them, there were no lack of loyal, righteous, and upright people who never forgot their homeland. Zheng Suonan (whose original name is no longer traceable), a survivor of the Song Dynasty, can be said to be the greatest of the great "character dismantling" experts. He did not help others resolve fortunes or predict the future, but focused on self-cultivation and loyalty to the country. Throughout his life, he would never sit or lie facing north, because the Song Dynasty had been destroyed by the Yuan Dynasty. He wanted to show his determination to never kneel to the enemy. His study had no decorations, only a plaque with the four characters "This World of Mine" written on it. People who saw this plaque didn't understand its meaning. If they asked him, he would mostly smile and not answer. In fact, to put it bluntly, this was precisely Mr. Zheng's skill in dismantling characters. The first character "本" (běn, root, origin) can be broken down into the characters "大" (dà, big) and "十" (shí, ten). Adding the "十" to the middle of the character "穴" (xué, cave) creates the character "宋" (sòng, Song). The so-called "This World of Mine" was originally the Southern Song world he was thinking of. His name, Suonan, also referred to this. His other name, Sixiao, was also a simple use of the character dismantling method, taking half of the character "趙" (zhào), "肖" (xiào), to express his longing for the Zhao Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Zheng Suonan was not only good at "character dismantling," but he was also discovered by later generations during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty to be a master at painting orchids. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, all the orchids he painted had exposed roots. Someone once asked him, "Why do you paint orchids with exposed roots and not paint the soil?" He replied, "Our Great Song has no territory left; it has been taken away by foreigners!"</p>
<p>His heart of loyalty and righteousness overflowed from his words. This is something that the likes of Kong Yiji could never achieve. Who would say it is inappropriate to call him China's greatest "character dismantling" expert?</p>
<p>Starving Hengyang - Feng</p>
<p>The rain drifting outside the window washed away the heat of the past two days. It has been two days since I arrived in Shanghai. Seeing the prosperity and song and dance of the city, I can't help but think of Hengyang, which I visited half a month ago. The prosperity of Shanghai and the disaster in Hengyang form a clear contrast in my mind. I can no longer remain silent.</p>
<p>Before the war, Hengyang was one of the leading commercial ports in Hunan. Apart from Changsha, Hengyang was one of the richest places. This time, due to the war, Hengyang suffered glorious wounds, lost everything it had, and fell tragically. When we arrived near the urban area of ​​Hengyang, we only saw broken walls and a desolate atmosphere that filled everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>In the central urban area, there is a north-south thoroughfare. The shops on both sides have all been rebuilt recently, mostly food stores, department stores, and silk shops. On both sides of the street are decorations rarely seen in other cities, that is, the disaster victims lying prostrate along the street. They all came from the surrounding villages. The green grass could no longer support them. Because they could get flour and porridge in the city, they came to the city reluctantly with the old and the young. We saw their pale faces, skinny limbs, swaying steps, and trembling hands holding an empty bowl. Or they held a pair of chopsticks in their hands, moving like wandering ghosts on both sides of the road. From time to time, they would collapse and die... The sun in June was scorching hot, and there were also occasional heavy rains. Their resistance had long been weakened, and they died silently one after another. According to the city government's statistics, about 2,000 people starve to death every day. This is only limited to the disaster victims who are wandering on the streets of the city. They don't even have the strength to shout the last "hungry"!</p>
<p>I personally saw a seven- or eight-year-old boy, naked, starve to death on the side of the road near the porridge distribution site and the orphanage for disaster victims. His stomach was severely concave. An old woman told me that he was still crying five minutes ago, asking for some porridge. I also personally saw a strong man whose head was as small as a child due to starvation. Only because of his disproportionately long limbs did I decide that he was starving to death. God, what a terrible disaster!</p>
<p>In order to learn more about the starvation situation in Hengyang, we visited families in areas about fifteen miles away from the city center. We visited the seventh district. The seventh district has a total of fourteen bao. The bao near the city had rice to eat, and those farther from the city ate rice mixed with grass. The only difference was the ratio of rice to grass in the mixture. The grasses they ate included: Xia Ku Cao, dandelion, hemp mulberry, and wormwood. I saw a girl screaming in pain because she mistakenly ate poisonous grass. Her face was red and swollen, and tears were streaming down her face. The sound tore my heart apart, and I asked myself in a low voice, whose fault is this?</p>
<p>The old people told me with tears in their eyes that their days were not long, and they would rather die sooner. The children told me that eating grass for a long time made their stomachs swell and their limbs weak. The farmers told me that they had good land but could not cultivate it, mainly because they did not have the strength to produce. They said, "Sir, without food, where can we find the strength to farm? We have no choice but to let it lie fallow. What can we do?" In addition, thirty or forty families share one cow, and there are also major problems with seeds. Some people who make a living by selling their labor told me, "Sir, this year, you can't even sell your strength for money!" I asked myself again in a low voice, how should this be solved?</p>
<p>Shanghai is affluent, at least outwardly. Foul smells, dirt, death, and starvation are foreign to Shanghai. However, the fact that there is such a disaster in the same country should attract the attention of the whole country. I hope all sectors will pay attention to disaster relief work.</p>
<p>A Few Words</p>
<p>How Much Living Expenses Should Be Left for the Families of Traitors? - Wuling Ren</p>
<p>An employee of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Mr. Yan, has many children. His family of eleven cannot maintain their livelihood. He sent a letter to the newspaper saying that if anyone wanted to "enjoy his later years," he was willing to let them adopt his children under the age of fifteen, and that "the children are honest and diligent, and are still able to study diligently." Reading this is heartbreaking. Offering one's own flesh and blood to others for "enjoyment in their later years" is a human tragedy that cannot be surpassed. In today's world, "honest" people suffer everywhere. Being a scholar is useless, and scholars are no longer valued. However, Mr. Yan still seems to think that his children have these two advantages that are sufficient to make them successful, hoping to attract people's attention. He is wrong!</p>
<p>He who is not moved by reading the "Chu Shi Biao" must be disloyal, and he who is not moved by reading the "Chen Qing Biao" must be unfilial. Then, is he who is unmoved by reading the "Memorial by Censor Cheng on the Misconduct of Grain Officials" also a corrupt person?</p>
<p>The Three Tigers of Guangzhou are causing trouble. If you don't believe it, look at the news: (1) Cholera was rampant for a while, with an average of more than 50 cases occurring every day; (2) The number of refugees and beggars dying of starvation on the streets is increasing day by day, and the burial team is "overwhelmed" (hoarding is rampant, and the price of rice is high, which is one of the reasons); (3) The number of car accidents has broken all previous records. The "epidemic tiger," the "market tiger," and the "hoarding tiger" are so terrible! Shanghai also has these three tigers causing trouble, and their rampancy is no less than that in Guangzhou. The authorities have measures to eliminate, catch, and prevent tigers. I only hope that they will not do things half-heartedly. Then, even if the tigers are fierce, they will not be able to use their skills, so that the people will no longer turn pale at the mention of tigers. What good fortune that would be!</p>
<p>Regarding the property of the traitors who have been sentenced, there are no clear legal provisions on how much living expenses should be left for their families. How much should be left and what is the standard? People in the legal field have been discussing this recently. According to Mr. Yang Litang, chief clerk of the Jiangsu High Court, the standard for leaving a portion should depend on the total amount of property, the number of family members, and the price level (excluding family members who can support themselves). His words are not only empty and difficult to handle, but one thing seems to have been determined, that is, the descendants of traitors who are able to support themselves should no longer be given property as necessary living expenses for their families. Is it yes or no?</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn: Right and Wrong - Fu Tongxian</p>
<p>Is there really right and wrong in this human world? This is a very troublesome philosophical question. According to the ancient Greek sophists, "There is no objective truth in the world, but everyone has his own truth." Zhuangzi's theory of equality of things also develops this idea. He said, "This is also that, and that is also this. That is also one right and wrong, and this is also one right and wrong. Is there really a that and this? Is there really no that and this?" He believed that "this" is "that," and that is "this." This is entirely a matter of different positions when people speak. If I stand in the position of "Fu Mou" to speak to Li Mou, then Fu Mou is "I" and Zhang Mou is called "he." If I stand in the position of "Zhang Mou" to speak to Li Mou, then Zhang Mou is "I" and Fu Mou is called "he." So Fu Mou is "I" in Fu Mou's eyes, and "he" in Zhang Mou's eyes. Similarly, Zhang Mou is "I" and also "he." So he also said: "One side can be right, and the other side cannot be right; one side cannot be right, and the other side can be right; because it is right, because it is wrong; because it is wrong, because it is right." The meaning is that from one side, it is "possible," but from the other side, it is "impossible." From one side, it is "impossible," but from the other side, it is "possible." This thinks it is right, that thinks it is wrong; that thinks it is wrong, this thinks it is right. In short, right and wrong are due to different subjective positions, and there is no objective standard.</p>
<p>We agree with Zhuangzi on two points: (1) Behavior itself has no right or wrong; (2) Right and wrong are not absolute, but relative. But we believe that right and wrong are not subjective judgments, but have an objective standard.</p>
<p>First, we say that behavior itself has no right or wrong. For example, I eat when I am hungry, sing when I feel uncomfortable, and try to escape when I encounter a dangerous situation. These behaviors have no right or wrong. Because we believe that morality originates from human social activities, that is to say, a person does not have innate right and wrong moral concepts, nor are there innate right or wrong behaviors. Right and wrong behaviors are produced from the relationships between people.</p>
<p>Second, we acknowledge that right and wrong are relative rather than absolute. But we oppose Zhuangzi's relativizing right and wrong to individual will, and we oppose the Greek sophists' subjective relativism of "the individual as the measure of all things." We advocate objective relativism. Because we believe that right and wrong concepts are related to the entire social relationship. Human behavior has no right or wrong if it is separated from the entire social relationship. Social relationships are also not fixed. Social relationships are the result of long-term evolution, and at the same time, they are constantly advancing. Thus, right and wrong concepts also evolve with social evolution. Social relationships also vary from region to region, so different places also have different right and wrong concepts. Therefore, right and wrong concepts are relative to a specific spatial and temporal social relationship. But does this mean that there are always many different right and wrong systems in this world? This question depends on the overall trend of social progress. From the perspective of the evolution of social organization, the regionality of social relations is gradually disappearing. In primitive times, individual behavior was limited to tribes, then evolved into feudal separatism, and then into a unified country. The expansion of social relations and the strictness of social organization show the unification of the right and wrong system.</p>
<p>Third, based on the above analysis, we know that the judgment of right and wrong is not based on a subjective position, but has its own objective standard. This objective standard is the gradually evolving social relationship that is tending towards completeness and rigor. Regarding the origin of right and wrong concepts, I may still quote a passage from Zhuangzi and then explain it. Zhuangzi said: "It can be done, it can be done; it cannot be done, it cannot be done. The way is formed by practice, and things are so named by saying." This word "可" (kě, can, may) is interpreted by Mr. Feng Youlan as "Possibility" (see his English translation of Zhuangzi). I interpret it as "can do". A child asks her mother, "Auntie gave me a piece of candy, can I take it?" The mother says, "Yes!" The child asks, "Can I take other people's money at will?" The mother says, "No!" I think this word "可" has a moral meaning. "What is called can do? What is called cannot do?" Zhuangzi thought this was the opinion of many people. Everyone says "can do," then this thing can be done; everyone says "cannot do," then this thing cannot be done. It's like a road in the countryside, which originally didn't exist, but later everyone walked on the same line, and over time it became a road. This thing originally had no name, but later everyone called it "dog," and now it is a dog. So Zhuangzi said: "The way is formed by practice, and things are so named by saying." This shows that Zhuangzi himself also admitted that right and wrong are based on everyone's opinion as the standard.</p>
<p>We can further ask: "Why do we all walk on this road and not another road in a wilderness? Can I personally be innovative and open up another path?" The answer is simple, because this route is the shortest from our village to that town. Similarly, in society, why do we say, "This thing can be done, but that thing cannot be done?" That is because this thing is beneficial to everyone, and that thing is harmful to everyone. So the production of right and wrong originally stems from the common interests of many people. Everything that promotes the common welfare is right, and everything that damages the common welfare is wrong. Therefore, we can specifically say that the concept of right and wrong is built on the common interests of the entire society. The medium that concretely represents the common welfare in society is the social system, because based on the intelligence, experience, and environment of the people of an era, this social system is most sufficient to represent the common welfare. Moral judgment is also based on this social system as the standard.</p>
<p>Based on this standard, the judgment of right and wrong is very clear. Right is right, and wrong is not right. When the two sides have a dispute about right and wrong, there are only four possibilities: (1) Both sides are right, but this is impossible, because since both sides use the common welfare as the standard, then they should have no room for dispute; (2) A is right and B is wrong, then this must be that A promotes the common welfare and B damages the common welfare; (3) B is right and A is wrong, the reason is the same; (4) Both A and B are wrong, this is because both sides only care about part of the welfare and have not considered the common welfare of the entire society. Now there is a kind of people who claim to be fair. When they see a dispute between the two sides, they do not ask about the right and wrong of the two sides, but only seek to stop the dispute between the two sides. In our opinion, truly fair people should return right to him who is right, and return wrong to him who is wrong; if both sides are wrong, they should point out the mistakes of both sides and put the real common welfare in front. We must fully support the right side and hinder the wrong side, or start from the premise of the common welfare and fight against the wrong of both sides with all our strength, striving to win the truth and eliminate selfish intentions. Otherwise, if right and wrong are not distinguished and black and white are not clear, society will continue to be so chaotic! We believe this is not the blessing of the whole society.</p>
<p>As for whether a certain social system truly represents the common welfare, this is a question, because in a certain era, people are limited by intelligence and experience, or due to the prejudices of a minority class, a kind of unreasonable system is produced, which is not sufficient to represent the welfare of all the people, and this needs to be thoroughly reformed to make it rational. We are prepared to bring this up for special discussion when there is an opportunity in the future.</p>

<p>Filial Piety - Qin</p>
<p>My younger sister sent 30,000 legal tender from faraway Kunming, saying that it was her private money accumulated day by day, especially for her mother's pocket money, because her brother-in-law's income was not very good, so don't let him know.</p>
<p>When I heard this news, I couldn't help but burst into tears.</p>
<p>I remember eight years ago, my brother-in-law was an internist in a hospital in Suzhou, with a monthly salary of seventy yuan. Twenty-five yuan was sent to his parents, and he, my sister, and a child lived in the hospital's doctor's dormitory. Rent and utilities were provided by the hospital, and the remaining forty-five yuan was used to maintain the life of a family of three.</p>
<p>My health was not good, and I needed to inject medication for a long time. For convenience, I lived in my sister's house for the whole summer vacation.</p>
<p>The hospital had coolies to clean the house every day. For the sake of me, an ignorant guest, they had to constantly call for tea and water. My sister paid a maid three yuan a month. Although rice was cheap at that time, it still cost six or seven yuan a month. It was either chicken and fish, or duck and meat. There were also two snacks in the morning and afternoon, and fruit after meals. The side dishes, fruits, and noodles cost about one yuan a day. On holidays, she would accompany me to visit Tiger Hill and watch movies. In this way, my brother-in-law's monthly salary was not enough to cover expenses.</p>

<h3>High Court Tries Traitors, Sets New Record: Verdict to be Announced This Month on the 21st in the Afternoon; Liang Hongzhi Case Concludes After Five Hours of Trial; Prosecutor Supplements Evidence of Defendant's Crimes; Court Summons Witness Xue Dake for Confrontation; Pleads for Leniency Based on a Poem in the Seven-Character Regulated Verse Form</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Liang Hongzhi, who was the first in the Southeast region to betray his country and surrender to the enemy, organize a puppet regime, raise the five-colored flag, establish the so-called Reformed Government, rule the occupied areas on behalf of the enemy, and assist them in their wrongdoing, had his trial concluded yesterday afternoon. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2:30 PM on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Judge Liu, along with Associate Judges Cao and Qiu, as well as Prosecutor Dai and the court clerk, took their seats at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. A court attendant presented files related to Liang, which were over a foot high. Prosecutor Dai began by standing and supplementing the facts of the defendant's crimes committed during his tenure in puppet positions, as well as the supporting documents, which were divided into three categories: (1) those during his tenure in the "Reformed Government"; (2) those during his tenure in the "United Committee of the Government of China"; and (3) those after joining the puppet National Government. These included various important documents, such as the "Commemorative Album of the First Anniversary of the Reformed Government," the outline of the "Anti-Communist and National Salvation Representative Conference Plan" of the puppet Ministry of Interior, the anniversary declaration of the "China"-Japan Treaty, the declaration of the Anti-Communist and National Salvation People's Congress, the proposals of Chu Qinglai of the puppet Ministry of Communications regarding "China"-Japan joint ventures, and the "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction Literature." After Judge Liu reviewed them, he handed them over to Liang for detailed reading. Except for some attempts to shift responsibility, he admitted that they were correct. Then, Judge Liu asked Liang if he had any further statements to make. Liang stated: "The first reason I organized the Reformed Government was to preserve the nation's vitality, and the second was to reduce the suffering of the people. I was not willingly surrendering to the enemy or opposing the central government. My visit to Japan was merely a courtesy reply and I did not conclude any diplomatic agreements. As for Wang Zhaoming's '　telegram,' I did not know the central government's intention and thought it was a dual approach, so I neither opposed nor agreed. In the early spring of the 29th year, Vice President Kong of the central government sent representative Xue Dake to Shanghai to discuss supplying firewood to the central government. Therefore, I entrusted Xue to forward a telegram to express my feelings. Subsequently, Judge Liu summoned witness Xue Dake. According to Xue's testimony, he came to Shanghai in March of the 29th year of the Republic to engage in divisive work within the puppet regime. Liang entrusted him to send a long telegram, the gist of which was to express his willingness to join the puppet regime to alleviate the suffering of the people, without any intention of resisting the central government, and he received a reply stating that he should remain in the puppet regime for the time being. In the 33rd year, Liang rescued Dong Renji, the former dean of the Law School of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping, and Mo Qianli, the current Director of the Education Bureau in Beiping, from prison. Both of them had been sentenced to 15 years by the puppet court and were released on bail by Liang." At this point, Judge Liu, at the request of the prosecutor, ordered Xue to temporarily leave and then questioned Liang, saying, "When did you rescue the underground workers?" Liang replied, "In the spring of the 34th year." The judge asked, "Where was Dong Renji detained at the time?" Liang replied, "He was detained in the Beiping Gendarmerie." The judge asked, "How did you bail him out?" Liang replied, "I asked Okada to call the Japanese Embassy in Beiping from Nanjing." The judge asked, "What was their response?" Liang replied, "There was no response." The judge asked, "When did Xue Dake come?" Liang replied, "In February or March of the 29th year, on the orders of the Vice President of the Executive Yuan to come to Shanghai." The judge asked, "Where did you talk with him?" Liang replied, "In the puppet Executive Yuan." The judge asked, "What was your relationship with Xue?" Liang replied, "There was no relationship." Then, Xue Dake was summoned again to compare his testimony. Only the address of the meeting was accurate. Xue initially said it was the Legislative Yuan, but later said it was the Control Yuan. Liang added, "During the era of the puppet Reformed Government, the Japanese strongly wanted Liang to form a Political Security Bureau and a Food Control Bureau, but these did not materialize, which was beneficial to the people. Moreover, in the 27th and 28th years, I never killed a single patriot or defrauded a single good civilian. As a mere scholar, I argued with the invaders and made a small contribution to the war of resistance. I never intended to resist my own country." After he finished speaking, Judge Liu announced the start of the debate. Prosecutor Dai began by standing and arguing that Liang was a politician from the warlord era and a pro-Japanese member of the Anfu clique. Taking advantage of the retreat of the national army to the west, he alone stood up and organized the "Reformed Government" to oppose the central government. His act of conspiring with the enemy was obvious. The defendant's claim that he did not establish special agents and grain control agencies, thus benefiting the people, was also inaccurate, as benefiting the people requires positive actions. Subsequently, he made numerous arguments regarding the crimes committed during his tenure in puppet positions. Then, lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Zhu Hongru, and Li Guozhen defended the defendant in order. Lawyer Zhang stated: "The defendant (1) is not a member of the Kuomintang and is different from those who betray the country and the party; (2) from beginning to end, he had no intention or sign of confronting the country; (3) he surrendered earliest. In the late stage of the war of resistance, he jointly defended against bandits with Ren Yuandao and resisted rebellious troops; (4) he committed no misgovernment during his tenure in the puppet government." Lawyer Zhu stated: "The Anfu clique never existed. Its leader, Duke Duan, repeatedly advocated for the republic and contributed to the Republic of China. He was by no means a pro-Japanese faction. In prosecuting traitors today, we should not ask whether they were in a puppet government or not, but only whether they were traitors or not. During the 'Reformed' era, the defendant cherished his homeland and criticized the Japanese invaders. He wrote a seven-character regulated verse: 'I put down my books and wine cup, and the beautiful days rush away, never to return. I feel like a spring orchid bound in layers, and my heart is like a silkworm moth, inch by inch turned to ashes. The swords and bows under the steps are like children's games, and how many talents are in the limited banners? Whipping the six kingdoms is a common thing, it's a pity the people of Qin do not lament for themselves.' His love for the country and deep resentment towards the enemy are evident in the words, so please consider the circumstances of the case and impose a lenient sentence." Lawyer Li emphasized Liang's contributions. But Liang finally said, "I don't need to show my achievements, but my heart must be shown." By this time, it was 8:05 PM, and Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 21st. Yesterday's trial of the Liang case lasted five hours, setting a new record for the High Court's trial of traitors. After leaving the courtroom, the night was dim, and Liang still met with his family. At that time, Liang was wearing a gray hemp long jacket, blue silk pants, and black leather shoes. He held a white bamboo folding fan and carried a pair of old glasses. He was hunched over, his hair was white, and he looked very old. His wife's face was covered in makeup, and she looked much younger compared to Liang. After exchanging greetings, Liang was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zhentang</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhao Zhentang from Dongtai, the puppet Vice Minister of Judicial Administration, also served as the Chief Judge of the puppet Shanghai High Court and the President of the puppet Shanghai District Court. He was tried by Judge Feng yesterday morning. According to his statement: his house was destroyed by enemy fire, his life was impoverished and difficult to live, and he witnessed that the people in the occupied areas had no judicial protection, and their lives and property were greatly destroyed. Therefore, his assumption of puppet positions was to protect the lives and property of the people with the spirit of the rule of law. The court discussion was adjourned for further questioning and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zunyue</h3>
<p>In addition, the High Court yesterday brought Zhao Zunyue, who had served as the puppet Minister of Propaganda and other positions, for trial. Zhao is from Changzhou and is forty-nine years old. According to his statement: "After the government retreated to the west, the people were unable to fully evacuate. The 30 million people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were under enemy oppression, living in dire straits. Their suffering can be imagined. After Wang Zhaoming came to Shanghai, he invited me to talk, because I was quite familiar with Shanghai and worked in the press, so I was quite familiar with Wang. The result of the discussion was that in the process of winning the War of Resistance, we must save these people who are in hell. We should seek benefits for the people, regardless of merit or demerit. On the principle of not violating the War of Resistance, I took office in puppet positions and participated in peace talks." He also denied each point regarding the implementation of harsh taxes, the promotion of enslaving education, and the control of the press. Subsequently, the defense lawyer stated that Zhao had protected the work of secret radio stations during his tenure in puppet positions and requested the court to summon witnesses Wang Yaoqin, Lu Yiming, and Robin, as Robin had introduced him to Liu Baichuan, and Zhao established a radio station to communicate with the central government. After detailed questioning, the court discussion was adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>[Another report] Li Wenbin, the puppet Vice Minister of Interior and "National Government" Political Affairs Advisor, his son Li Zhenyu (clerk of the puppet Ministry of Interior), and Su Dehuai, the puppet army commander, were also interrogated and adjourned for further questioning.</p>
