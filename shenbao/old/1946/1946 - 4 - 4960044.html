<h3>政府共黨繼續商談　對停止衝突恢復交通　在大體上已獲得協議</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶三日電〕美駐華特使馬歇爾，近日接見各方人員，聽取意見，始終保持沉默態度致未能繼續進行。惟據共產黨在代表中人表示：共產黨對恢復交通及受降等問題，似不願與停止衝突一案同時解決。各方輿論，咸望共產黨不再堅持成見，早日圓滿答復。前行政院副院長孔祥熙氏，定今日設宴損毀待共產黨代表，以示新年聯歡。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日午夜廣播稱：國民政府與共黨之第三次團結談判，今日下午續在重慶舉行，結果未明，按此項談前，自十二日二十七日以還已舉行三次矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶三日電〕政府代表張主席羣，王部長世杰，召秘書長力子，與中英代表周恩來，黃必武，葉劍英，王若飛四氏，於三日下午五時半，繼續商談。延安方面已有覆電，雙方對於停止衝突恢復交通辦法，在大體上商得同意，仍將綢續舉行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶三日電〕府對中共提出停戰方案，延安方面大體似可接受，但恢復鐵路交通一項提議，仍然從中作梗。據此間消息靈通人士意見，中共無條件接受停戰方案（包括恢復交通一項在內），由美國特使馬歇爾參加三方面委員會，斡旋停戰，此事鮮有可能。中共不致反對馬使出任斡旋，其主要反對目標，乃爲放棄鐵路問題。中共必欲在鐵路交通恢復及討論其他問題前，無條件停止衝突。此間權威方面感覺，即使停止衝突，獲有成議，但在會義繼續進行前，罕有實施之望。整個局勢微妙複雜，未可輕加揣測。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安三日電〕中共對於政府當局停戰對案，已於今日正式提出復文，聲明「關於癢癢即停戰及實行團結民主各項建議，準備進行討論，促其實現。」中共發言人並稱。蔣主席主張邀請美國駐華特使馬歇爾參加談判，中共表示歡迎。至於推定共他公正正人士如民主同盟，組織軍事考察團，亦所贊同。</p>
<p>馬歇爾工作忙碌續接見各方人土</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日午夜廣播稱：馬歇爾將軍今在重慶接見中國各方面人士甚多，計有主敎于斌，北京大學校長傳思年，商震，白崇禧。商震並與共黨代表周恩來密談一小時。</p>
<p>〔聨合社重慶三日電〕周恩來今日與美國特使馬歇爾作半小時談話後，亦出席會議。周氏於元旦日亦曾與馬使會晤。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日合衆電〕美國務院今日宣佈，任美駐西班牙大使館代辦白德華茲，為駐華特使馬歇爾元帥之經濟及財政顧問，於馬帥使任期間，執行職務。　〔聯合社重慶三日電〕報載，政治協商會議十日開幕時，蔣主席因公務繁忙，不能每次蒞塲担任主席，將由立法院晨孫科代理，孫院長爲政府方面八代表之一。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕華盛頓郵報今日社評稱：中國和平希望，似較最近任何時期為濃厚，但愼勿遽下斷語，而謂重慶延安間之危機已告消除。各黨各派固均同意終止流血，然目的一致之外貌，往往含有手段逈不相降異見。情形如是，若謂相爭各黨即將放下武器，而和平即可降臨此久經戰亂之地，實尚嫌過早。</p>
<h3>共黨答覆停戰建議前　竟稱將爭取熱河　開入熱境國軍已抵朝陽</h3>
<p>〔路透社重慶三日電〕據政府方面報告稱，中央軍已開入熱河省之煤·金·銀鑛中心阜新。　〔聯合社重慶二日電〕中央軍現正紛紛開入熱河，共黨方面宣稱：共軍將爭取熱河，抵抗進攻，「此爲內戰」云。當此全國人民皆在靜待共黨答覆政府停戰提議，終止內爭之時不意共黨方面竟有此項宣言，共黨發言人早先曾謂，政府接收熱河，係當然之事，此次國軍開入熱河，被認爲企圖逐出內蒙共軍之起點。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平三日電〕開往熱河國軍已抵朝陽，該處飛機塲及設備，均遭共軍破壞。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安三日電〕共黨第八路軍司令部本日報告軍事局勢稱：中央軍沿包頭大同鐵路綫推進，現距綏遠省集寗城僅一二十里，其東，中央軍集中於北平，古北口及南口間三角地區者共八萬人，尚有增援部隊源源開到，其目的地爲熱河省城承德。同時，歸綏及大同方面中央軍，則將開往察哈爾省城張家口。山東方面津浦路共軍，已於十二月三十日佔領禹城（位於濟南北面九十里），國軍八萬人則已開到韓莊。河南，湖北邊區，共黨新四軍第五師已被包圍，該方面中央軍目的地，係爲河南南部之信陽。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原三日電〕同蒲南段洪洞迄富家灘間的八十公里之鐵路，前經共軍破壞。鐵軌多投入汾河及山溝，枕木一律焚燬，路基被挖成齒形深溝，雖經路方星夜搶修，惟以破壞過鉅，短期難修復。</p>

<p>馬帥愛花，每日除飭人購買鮮花數千元外，往訪客人，亦常携花以贈。</p>
<p>馬帥住怡園內，外事局特派聯絡官劉悟照料一切，此人已成爲記者們採訪之對象，惟其發言謹愼，堪與馬帥比美。馬帥之隨行衛士，身體魁悟，機警而和靄，亦爲馬帥之得力助手</p>
<p>怡園門禁森嚴，每日車水馬龍，賓客頻繁，忙繁外事局負責人員，該局人員出入，皆須帶AB證章。</p>
<p>馬郎深愛讀書，允愛名人傳記及歷史，此次來華携帶書籍甚多，其中多爲美軍印行之縮版小說，每一晚間即閱畢一本。</p>
<p>馬帥年輕時曾居菲律賓甚久，此次來華行經馬尼刺時，曾有一菲人奔至元帥之前，自稱當馬氏早年在菲時，渠曾在馬氏鹿下服務，馬帥以六五之齡仍能記憶此人，乃與之握手，一時傳爲佳話。</p>
<p>上月三十一日，爲馬帥六五誕辰，蔣夫人特設宴爲其祝嘏。（元旦寄自重慶）</p>
<h3>國軍候命入新民　接防詳確辦法商談極圓滿　空運受氣候影響須再延緩</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平三日電〕國軍自華北空運哈爾濱，長春及瀋陽，一再延期後，昨日原可起飛，因氣候惡劣，又受阻礙。據東北行營宣佈：如氣候良好，本週末可以空運。同時，杜聿明部陸軍現在新民附近，候命入城。杜氏與蘇軍聯絡官仍在談判中，但進行順利。各省政府在蘇軍聯絡官協助之下，將逐步接收。蘇軍仍定於二月一日完成撤退。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州三日電〕我軍進駐新民之詳確辦法，前由杜長官部派上校科長王侃璽，率領隨員等，赴新民與蘇方接洽，結果極爲圓滿。東路接防部隊，自打虎山沿公路於三日午進至距新民六公里之大黃旂堡。右路接防部隊，亦自打虎山沿鐵路於同時進至距新民九公里之柳河溝。王侃　氏俟該接防部隊，到達兩目的地時，即與蘇方聯絡人員密切聯繫，以便接收新民城區防務。與蘇方洽商接防之彭璧生將軍，四日晨即由錦州出發，逕赴瀋陽。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>政治協商的成功條件</h3>
<p>勝利後的第一個元旦，倐已消逝了，新年已過到第四天。這四天，應該是是普天同慶的四天，然而中國却還有若干地方的老百姓，沒有「同慶」的福分！大家聽見政治協商會議將於十日召開，好似病家獲得了萬應靈丹，一粒吃下去，定可轉危爲安。我們也希望眞能如此，允共薪求早能如此。協商成功，政治解次，蔣主席所說和平安定的環境得以造成，老百姓眞能够「同慶」春節，回家的早日回家，復員的早日復員，歡歡喜喜的喝一杯春酒。協商，協商，天下人都仰望這回協商能够成功。</p>
<p>可是華盛頓郵報社評，却說中國和平希望，雖頗濃厚，但愼勿謂危機已告消除，目的一致之外貌，往往含有逈不相降之異見。我們初以爲外人的批評或許過苛，但據昨日延安電訊，共黨一面答復政府所提停止術突方案的意見，說是準備進行討論，一面却堅次要求「國軍退出熱河」，吾則將認爲眞正「內戰」之始。照共黨這種兩面手法的作風來看，的確，美報以爲未許樂觀過早，不失爲了解共黨而近於事實的判斷。本來，國家大事，按照情理，根據法律，應怎麼辦，就怎麼辦，自有軌道可循，用不着什麼協商。現在旣然要協商，可見協商的各方，必須有互諒互讓的氣度，方能望共有成。我們要先問：政府有沒有這種氣度呢？共黨有沒有這種氣度呢？如果口頭說協商，手頭動兵器，那末協商究有何用？　蔣主席元且廣播，昭告軍民：「政府對政治必盡量開放，對民主必提前實行，而全國軍隊，必須統轄於國家，聽命於政府」。又說：「在國民大會召開以前，準備延攬社會賢達與各黨派人士來參加政府」，「祗是參加政府的各黨派，不能擁有共自主的軍隊，來作政爭的工具」。這幾句扼要的話，如果政府能一個字一個字的做到，不但政府確可顯示其民主雅量，相諒相讓的氣度，而且人民的安居樂業，國家的强大統一，部可於此奠其基礎。然而共產黨怎樣呢？</p>
<p>國軍開入熱河，乃受降工作的一部份，這是中外周知的事實，且與我國對盟邦所負之義務有關，共黨憑什麼理由可以阻撓？况且共黨也早先承認「政府接收熱河乃當然之事」，何以目前又似乎遺忘了這句話，反而說國軍開入熱河將爲眞正「內戰」之始？再看到共軍在蘇北及山東一帶的蠢動，以及共軍山陜北源源移調熱綏境內，更可見共黨一方面派了代表在陪都與中樞商談，一方面在各重要地區從沒有一天停止過軍事行動。至於要它「還軍於國」，尤其不知將等到何年何月。老百姓究竟犯了什麼罪孽，共黨一定要使他們於抗戰勝利以後還連一個新年都不讓大家歡歡喜喜的過。</p>
<p>共黨在年前大事宜傳，提出了「無條件停戰」的建議，而實則所謂「無條件」的三項辦法，就是意在「凍結」國軍於現在的防地，使國軍所負受降繳械遣俘的工作無從完成，而共黨便可乘機再事充實其軍力，鞏固其地盤，以爲協商停頓時再動干戈之準備。如果眞掖了這種機心，來參加協商，根本就不免缺乏誠意。「不誠無物」，還談什麼協商，呌我們老百姓眞够躭心。儘管政府想請馬歇爾特使來做一個居間調解人，共黨也表同意，而協商會議在這種空氣裏召集，是否能順利進行，圓滿功德，今天還不敢遽下斷語。</p>
<p>可是未來的政治協商會議，祗可望其成功，不能讓其失敗。因爲這服藥如再不靈。動口不得，叉要動手，生民自然不能避免再罹戰亂之禍。那末，究竟怎樣纔可以促協商會議之成功呢？第一是要彼此眞誠，第二是要互相了解，第三是要絕對公開。</p>
<p>政黨是實行政治主張的一個團體，爲政治主張而有政爭，不必諱言，應該是家常便飯。爲政爭而辨難，甚而呌囂，也是民主國家司空見慣，無所希奇。但無論辨難也好，呌囂也好，一切政爭都要出之以眞誠。我主張什麼，就是什麼，切不可有僞裝。譬如說，國民黨信三民主義，就要實行三民主義；而共產黨今天旣諱言共產主義，却說願爲三民主義而奮鬥，則也就要不再以三民主義爲僞裝。今天大家說不打仗，就要大家眞的不打仗。可是不能利用「不打仗」三個字，阻止國軍受降遺俘工作的執行，尤其不能利用「不打仗」三個字來作爲「不許人家還手，只許我打人家」的護符。必須開會商談的時候，不再玩弄名詞的把戲，絕對具有實行的誠意，會議纔能成功。</p>
<p>其次，民主政治的精神固然在於能够容忍對方，而其在於能够了解對方。因爲兩個本來絕不了解的人，處在一地，不但根本就無做朋友的資格，連做仇敵的資格也沒有。必須逐漸了解，以至於澈底了解，然後合的可以做朋友，不合的可以做仇敵。羅斯福夫人說過，她不喜歡「容忍」這字眼，因爲容忍還是勉强的，她以爲必須先求互相了解，而後可以互相喜歡。馬歇爾特使在除夕安會席上也說，必須要合作、了解、與忍耐，那末和平就有了保障。故協商的各方，不論是政友也好，政敵也好，都應先從了解對方開始。了解對方的主義，了解對方的政策，了解對方的主要人物，了解對方的眞正要求，了解對方的平素作風，一切一切必須充分了解，然後可以相諒相讓相容忍，化干戈而爲玉帛，政治協商會議方有明朗的前途。</p>
<p>最後，這次政治協商會議乃國民大會召開以前一帖臨時救急的藥方，關係國家民族者很大。會議的成功與失敗，不僅是國共兩黨的事，也不祗是各黨各派的事，而是有關全國國民休戚安危的大事，故國民自有考問的必要，萬一失敗，尤其有追究責任的主權。民主國家的議會裏，不論有什麼論辯，除了絕對機密案件以外，報紙上大抵有詳盡的紀錄，輿論也可各作自由的批判，惟其如此公開，所以祗有政爭而無兵爭。誰是誰非，自有人民公論來判決，用不着動刀動槍。政治協商會議應該鑒於以往數次共黨問題商談並無多大收穫，改變作風，不視協商爲奇貨，而應以向國民公閒爲尋求正當解決的不二法門。然後那一面的辦法不合理，那一方的議論不入情，人民自會有公論來折服它。任何一方不能利用秘密來欺矇老百姓，躱避自已的資任，而歸其破裂之咎於他方。而且，參加會議諸公應該自己明白，諸公並非國民選出來的代表，諸公今天來商談國是，協議政治，是否能於情理法三者都說得通，還有待於國民的一句話，故祗有向國民公開，纔可逼得協商會議不能不成功。</p>

<h3>日戰力完全摧毀　民治基礎奠定　麥帥管理日本全面報吿發表</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕獎陸軍部本日發表　帥駐節日本之首次全面報告，內稱：苟無應念食糧輸入，日本可能於三個月內遭遇　　　，該報告稱，至少須有三·三一一·〇〇〇公噸綸人日本。報告書共數巨則，所涉範圍至廣，例如日本圓內黑市猖獄，工業混亂，農夫受　風洪水之災口　等，均詳述無遺。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕藝克阿致美國陸軍部報告書，於今日發表。內稱：日本軍隊復員，進行迅速順利，並未發生事故。一九四五年九月一日，日本國內陸海軍兵力總計四百萬人，尚有陸海軍兵員三百三十四萬人分配於各佔領地。至十月十五日，日本陸軍已不復存在，海軍於實際上亦已解體。聯合國佔領日本之主要目的，厥在激底破壞日本戰力之工業基礎，現在以全力趨向比項目標。於戰時空襲及他種攻擊破壞力之外，復佐以各種方法，使日本戰爭潛力滅至微未不足計數。日本旣失去殖民地原料，對外貿易及航業復遭受統制，其經濟能力已因此大滅。目前日本之經濟狀况殊爲可憐，工業失去平衡，原料亦將告竭。一九四六年食糧供給尤爲可慮。報告書又謂：美軍駐在日本，實爲決定日本前途之主要因素，美軍在日行動足資模範。佔領軍當局已採取積極步驟，爲日本民主政治奠定基礎，惟日政府於兩個月佔領期間，對趨向民主之基本改革絕少建議，政治活動因人民集中注意於衣食住三項，以致妨碍進行，即生活必需品，日本亦惑不足，欲望人民自然的廣泛參加政治，未免不合現實。至於民主，日本人索無經騐，僅有封建主義與全能主義爲其背景，幾千萬農民及一般婦女，在政治上可謂一無智識。</p>
<p>徵用日本勞工擬有三項辦法</p>
<p>到於徵用日本勞工問題，麥帥擬有三種辦法：（一）日日本輸出勞工，以服務作賠償，應限於專門人才，用以裝置及管理遷移之工業設備。（二）留用原在中國期鮮及東九省之技術及管理人員，爲安定各地經濟所不可少者。（三）南太平洋問散無事之日木軍民，可利用復興毀損區城，或從事新建設。</p>
<p>日本敎育制度予以澈底改革</p>
<p>麥帥報告書嗣論及日本敎育制度，謂已擬有澈底改改方案，並希望將來更派遺一考察團至日本，以協助整個學校制度之善後事宜。目前方草擬計劃，俾令覆員之軍人及戰時工人，得重入大學肄業。日本投降時全國敎育制度，實際上已完全停頓，學生一千八百萬人及學校四千所被毀，敎師均充滿國家主義思想，今則所有軍事學校已被封用，有妨碍之課程亦已剔除。對於　員及學生之改造，現正利用無線電，並已開始推動敎育機關，增加敎科書以應需要。戰後日本學校中教職員人選亦在嚴密調查中，凡認爲有妨碍之敎師均已去職。復員軍人暫時亦不准從事敎育，須俟詳細調查後再行定奪。</p>
<p>朝鮮劃區管轄政策窒碍難行</p>
<p>對於朝鮮問題，麥帥謂將朝鮮分爲南北兩部，由美蘇分別管理。在政策及行動方面，不免引起許多間題。韓人對於劃分南北甚但現已在北方面獲有進步。與蘇聯所佔領之韓國北部恢復鐵路交通，亦為一迫切問題。在內政方面，日本所制定施行之法律，几認為有妨碍者均已廢除。法院方面日本推事均已撤換，代以韓人，警察方面，亦已採取同樣措置。向例警察可不俟審問將犯人處罰，現已加以嚴禁。在日韓人共的二百萬名，包括被徵而來者三十五萬人在內，去年十月已有十六萬人遺回韓國。</p>

<h3>納粹黨副元首　鮑爾曼已死</h3>

<h3>法艦載人犯擅自離滬　我當局嚴重抗議　外部辦事處發表交涉經過</h3>
<p>法國駐滬總領事館，在滬擅捕法國納粹人犯之消息傳出後，此間各界以法方藐視我國主權，深為篤訝憤慨。并悉，前法公董局法籍職員卡可平諾，於去年十二月三日被法領事警察逮捕，拘禁於貝當路法兵營內，達四星期之久。於前日下午四時，被法領事館當局，押解往於上月廿四日駛抵此間撤退法軍法僑之白爾丁巡洋艦上，定於三日上午十一時離上海駛往西貢審訊。外交部駐滬辦事處及市政府聞訊後，以該艦來滬任務係撤退法軍法僑，前項行動顯已超越範團，乃即向法總領事提出抗議，并通知法方在未奉我外交部指示前，該艦不得擅自離滬。詎該艦竟於昨晨九時五十分，未通知我方，擅自載該被捕之法籍納粹人犯啟椗離滬。法總領事曾於事後往市政府訪晤何副市長，謂願即刻赴吳淞口，將該艦追回。但白爾丁號早已駛出吳淞口外，迄至昨晚尚未返滬。中央社記者昨特往訪外交部駐滬辦事處秘書呂懷君博士，（辦事處主任霸國廉氏赴京），祗告該案經過如下：</p>
<p>抗議內容</p>
<p>先是，本埠報紙於上月下旬登載與本案相關之消息，我外交部駐滬辦事處主任，曾就此事於廿八日發表談話。本年元旦，該處接本市當局報告，謂法國駐滬總領事館，確已故意破壞我國廢除領事裁判權之措施，自行逮捕駐滬法國納粹人民卡可平諾。并擬於本月二日，將該犯由最近泊滬之法國兵艦白爾丁號押解回法云云。呂秘書於當日下午四時，即面致法國駐滬總領事嚴重抗議書一件，內容大要為：（一）各國在華領事裁判權早經一律廢止。（二）法國駐滬總領事館立即封閉領事法庭。（三）若所接報告確屬事實，則不得不嚴重抗議，要求迅將該犯移交我國軍警當局，轉送我國司法機關，依法處理。（四）法總領事此舉不但損害我國主權，抑且影響中法兩國固有之邦交，其後果應由法總領事負完全責任。</p>
<p>法領答覆</p>
<p>法總領事費禮浩氏當時即作口頭答覆，復於次日（二日）當即送到書面覆文，其內容大要為：（一）法總領事承認係於上年十二月三日，在滬自行拘捕勾結德國之法奸卡可平諾。上年十二月廿八日，上海法國領事法庭放棄此案，移交西貢法庭受理，乃於本年元旦，將該犯押上法艦白爾丁號，擬於一二日內離滬。（二）法總領事并未接得法駐華大使關於封閉領事法庭之通知。（三）在中法新約未簽字生效前，法總領事仍握有領事裁判權，惟甚願中法新約早日簽字，在未簽字前，願保證儘力使領事法庭之活動減至最低限度，使儘景不妨害中國司法機關之自由進行。（四）法總領事將以我方之抗議書原文，呈送其本國政府。</p>
<p>再提抗議</p>
<p>二日上午，呂秘書又聞悉法艦白爾丁號將於三日上午十一時，押解犯人卡可平諾離滬，送於當日下午五時，再訪法總領事提出口頭抗議，內容大要為：（一）我方不承認法總領事有權捕解該犯人。（二）該法艦來滬之任務，經我外交部限定為撤兵與撤僑，并不包括押解犯人，該艦若欲押解犯人出口，越出原定任務，應再經我國當局核準。（三）依照國際公法，兵艦在外國港口不應有違犯當地法律之行為，否則所在國得采取適當行動，予以制裁。（四）法總事領及該艦艦長費利浦中將，若決意押解該犯離滬，則一切後果，應由彼等負完全責任。法總領事當時即口頭答稱，願竭其所能，當晚赴法艦與艦長商議，將我方意見轉達艦長。但因艦長不受總領事指揮，而時間上亦不及向法政府請示，故不能保證云云。</p>
<p>市府通知</p>
<p>本市市政府亦於同日（二日）下午六時，以書面通知法總領事，謂該法艦若押運該犯離滬，殊屬越出原經我方核準之任務以外，應俟我方重加核準後，始可出口，否則一切後果應由法總領事及該艦艦長負完全責任。昨（三）日上午九時五十分，該法艦竟啟椗離滬。法總領事上午曾到本市市政府訪晤何副市長，謂願即刻赴吳淞口追回該艦，尙無續訊。又聞呂氏現正根據連日所提之書面及口頭抗議，考慮應行續采之必要步驟，日來并已將本案案情電呈外交部，我外交當局諒即有所決定，以維護我國國法尊嚴，及國家之主權與威信。</p>
<h3>三方面軍副司令　鄭洞國繼任</h3>
<p>第三方面軍副司令官兼上海指揮所主任張雪中近調任某要職，遺缺由鄭洞國副司令官繼任，張鄭兩氏於昨晚宴記者，由鄉任之等報告今後遣送數近七十五餘萬之日僑日俘，將利用美國登陸艇及專輪十六艘，可能於一二月內全部遣送完畢。</p>
<h3>敵產會決定　發還三廠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第三批發還之廠家，因一部份尙待請求行政院後始可決定，故昨日第二十八次敵偽產業審議會議僅通過發還本國廠商三家，計九合鐵廠，德泰機器，華昌銅精廠。</p>
<p>上海區敵偽產業處理局第六批平賣布日內即可出售，另將大量布疋，交由中國紡織建設公司自由批發應市。開善後救濟總署之美棉，不日即可抵滬，故花紗布價將更趨低落。至本市敵偽紗廠將由中紡公司全部接收。</p>
<h3>奸逆江友根　今日續審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕奸逆江友根左明招工供敵案，將於今日在提籃橋上海監獄高法院再度開審。按江逆等曾於民國卅年在滬招募華工赴菲，為敵方工作，尙有工人多名，迄無下落。</p>
<h3>劃分區域　實行公娼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警察局鑒於本市鄉連社及按摩院之設立，不但有傷風化，且有碍不衛生，故於一日起已獲市府批準予以封閉。市政當局決永久取締此類營業，聞將劃分固定區域旅行公娼制度，俟規定辦法，通過後即發給執照。至於失業導女救濟辦法，正由社會局擬具中。</p>
<h3>匪徒勒索金條　國藥號主突被綁架　十五小時內救出肉票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金神父路B字一一七號榮春堂國藥號，於前晚六時四十五分左右，突發生一擄人勒綁案，被綁者係廣東人藍寳榮，幸經警務當局破案迅速，卒將肉票安然出險，各情如次：</p>
<p>汽車綁架</p>
<p>藍寳榮（別號輝如）年五十一歲，廣東人，富有資產，開設榮春堂國藥號有年，致遭匪徒覬覦，於前晚六時四十五分，突來匪徒五名，均持槍械，直衝上樓，偽稱某軍事機關人員，不問情由，將其綁架押登汽車而去。</p>
<p>警局調查</p>
<p>事後由其子繼能投報盧家灣警察分局，由趙分局長立派巡官秦伯良來警前往調查，并察勘汽降之方向，七時二十分許肉票忽繕二字條來家，囑其莫亂托人。另一紙致其帳房謂請李先生到來，請爾隨同來人至我處為要。</p>
<p>索五金條</p>
<p>當時由藍之堂弟思宏偕賬席楊助民等隨同李匪前往探視，一面亟密報分局派便衣警數名尾隨，至龍華附近，因黑暗異常，如警員誤走歧途，徒勞往返，迨思宏等抵匪窟後，由匪魁索價金條五條，方可釋回。而去人僅帶法幣十萬，金戒三只，金錶一只，相差過巨，至談判未有端倪。</p>
<p>煙行接洽</p>
<p>最後決定不足之數，迨明晨九時約在可可咖啡館會晤，詎臨時改在南市民國路七三一號光明煙行內（即思宏所開），於是趙酈正副局長率領金股長股員蔣兆龍李子華陳閑生馬少松翁鴻勛馬秉寧巡官秦偵良薛啟傑等均化裝小販車夫模樣，密佈於四週，於十時許果有一衣西裝者，施施而來。</p>
<p>突遭逮捕</p>
<p>經趙分局長窺破，由秦巡官將其抱住，并抄出手槍一支，子彈五發，拘局審訊，據供，名晨美，別號曦光，年二十六歲，奉天人，住西門夢花街晉德里三號，直認綁架肉票不諱，又稱肉票藏於華格果路當春樓菜館二樓。</p>
<p>救出肉票</p>
<p>當由原辦人員多名馳往上述地點營救肉票安然出險，并獲看守匪徒一人，名葉苞，四十一歲，浙江處州人，是案前晚發生，迄至昨日十一時破案，共計十五小時，該分局擬將斯案經過呈報總局，凡出力警員，予以獎勵。</p>

<h3>實行分程計算　電車今日起加價　二十四·十八兩路將恢復</h3>
<p>公用局為求改進交通及兼顧便利市民，維持公司業務起見，曾由公用局擬具本市電車整個改進方案，并召集英商法商兩公司研討推行步驟，對於現在尚未直接通車之二十四·十八兩路，決於三十五年一月內，設法恢復。同時於虹口公園至霞飛路及靜安寺路至善鑌路方面利用原有材料，將兩公司路軌設法提前接通，使南北車輛，均能直達。至票價一層，亦經再四研討，因路線長短不同，以前試行之劃一票價，衡諸上海實際情形，未盡適宜，故為顧到一般乘客之合理負担，准按遠近分站計算，以期公允。現聞電車頭等及無軌電車票價，均自三十元起，三等票價自二十元起，又公共汽車自四十元起，均按程遞增，自本月四日起實行。</p>

<h3>華股市場上　為何羣趨熱門　散戶最怕被套牢</h3>
<p>新的匯率令人望穿秋水，迄未頒布，投機市場由感覺銳敏漸趨麻木不仁，炲赤首被游資所遺棄，美鈔活躍了幾天，也漸歸平淡，華股遂代之而興，熱門股均已恢復了最高峰，有些已較偽幣本位高漲一倍，較為熱門的冷門股，也頗多叨光跟上，有些股票竟仍在票面法幣本位以下，遭了火災損失的新光內衣，同中國內衣或新亞藥廠相較，勤興衫襪同中法藥房或景綸衫襪相較，永安紗廠同中紡信和相較，真正的投資者，必棄前而擇後，這種畸形現象，恐怕要等到市場正式恢復，方可糾正，游資為什麼一定要羣趨熱門呢，惟一的答復，就是搶帽子容易脫手而已，散戶最怕的是被套牢，最近增資的股票，據報告資產足值法幣股本若干倍，但股本由偽幣改為法幣後，大多數總是要股東們再拿些出來，物價漲高了多少倍，眼巴巴光明到來，廠產無損，股東們除了票面上偽幣改法幣外，得不到一些好處，再要掏一次腰包，雖則師出有名，但衷心總不十分服貼，要賣無人要，出錢怕肉疼，已被貶入冷宮的股票，際此交替時期，各負責人不要再為私囊着想，黑暗時期已經過去，泥水撈魚可一而不可再，切莫忽略股東權益，自毀信譽，事實上資產旣這樣優厚，為什麼不將存貨脫售一部份，　股東們得些實惠，希各廠商有以自省，華股市場庶能由投機趨入投資正途，民族資本得以普遍發展。</p>

<h3>如何處置刦餘紗布　〔續〕</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>當時敵偽之壓迫我人民，每每於生敲活剝之餘，給以小糖小錢以示惠，明明強刦沒收，而美其名曰收買，明明強迫卒走，而迫以立具文書，曰出賣申請，且曰收買係出價購買，價欵中搭有黃金，殊不知其給價之低，縱就價欵之全部　，僅及當時市價四分之一，如將金子照時價申合，其總價亦不及二分之一，況金子須分二期領取，其中距離六個月，價欵中之偽幣，則至今未消，其實際上給價之低，蓋距二分之一遽甚。</p>
<p>即退一步，以當時表面上之直接損失而言，其最粗即最低檔之二十支棉紗，三十二年八月初，市價約每件四萬元，而敵偽所定之收買價格，為每件一萬元，其中半數發給黃金，計一兩二錢五分，以市價每兩八千元計，合一萬元，則鈔金合計，為每件一萬五千元，純損失每件二萬五千元，可列算式如左。</p>
<p>棉紗一件市價40.000元－（給價之半5.000元+（給價之又半黃金一兩2５×市價8.000元）=損失25.000元</p>
<p>當時強迫收去之紗布，如以布四十疋亦作一件計，可得總損失額如左。</p>
<p>（收買總數263.206件－保留數29.849件－免除數26.712件）×每件損失25.000元=總損失5.166.125.000元</p>
<p>以當時之直接損失言，其收買給價，蓋僅及市價百分之三七·五，不啻其中紗布一二九，一五四件完全為無償性質之奪取，況價欵中之半數鈔票，分六期付給，今抗戰勝利，猶未滿期，其幣值低落上之無形損失，尤難計數，此皆正當商人血汗之所積，為敵偽以非法手段強迫損害者</p>
<p>惟敵偽強迫收去之紗布，以運輸工具之缺乏，當時并未全數搬走，其由偽商統會保管而移交上海區敵偽產業處理局者，聞有左列數量。</p>
<p>棉紗　一三，二二六件</p>
<p>白坯布　一四六，九一二疋</p>
<p>加工布二，二一六，六三九疋</p>
<p>此乃當業僅存之元氣，雖由政府暫行接管，要當與敵偽產眾有別，一九四三年一月五日開羅同盟國共同宜言中有云。</p>
<p>「對於敵國政府在其直接間接佔原屬居住各該區人民（包括法人）之財產或權益，如有任何移轉或交易行為，保留宣告無效之權，本宣言對於此種移轉或交易，不論出諸公開劫掠與強奪之方式，或出諸形式上似乎合法，或甚至於跡近當事者自動履行之買賣方式，一律適用」。</p>
<p>國府所定收復區敵偽產業處理原則中有云。</p>
<p>「凡在戰事期內售與敵人之工廠，如所有人能提出確實證據，訊明售價在當時廠房機器市價百分之五十以下者，得認為被迫售賣之有力佐證」。</p>
<p>則敵偽強迫收買紗布之剩留部份，按諸當初之所謂收買，旣屬強刧之代名詞，而其出賣申請書之以強力壓迫訂立，及給價之遠小於當時市價二分之一，均足為當業者可以要求領回之有力佐證，況其不足二分之一未曾發給乎」？</p>
<p>或以當業者當時之未及正式聯名具呈政府，聲明此項強迫情事，及刧去後之前往敵偽組織領取價金，謂為手續不週，昧於近利，亦并非確論，以呈報而言，當時震動極廣，大後方政府已經明白了解，無須憑聯名呈報，始能證實其為強迫也，至於領取價金，職工之遣散，舍此安所取乎？本市，產業已罄，信用且無保障，孰肯從井中救人者，又孰有力從事此亘大而普遍之救援者？吾人試寫設身處地一想，當不忍有所責難也。（完）</p>

<h3>文藝的離去和歸來</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>最近這十幾年，我鑽到中國小說戲曲的研討堆裏去，就不曾爬出來過。說實話，我幾乎很少看文藝創作；只有一個例外，我看過不少的話劇，還都是在舞台上看的，也看到一部分的話劇原稿，則是朋友們拿來要我這外行批評的。要說什麼話，實在隔膜得很。但我究竟是以研究新文藝的姿態出現的，所以對於新文藝，還未能忘情，帶着眷戀地至少也看一看各篇文字的題目和作者。因爲好多作者都是我的朋友。對於朋友們的工作，我一向尊重。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事發生後，我在上海，與後方的文藝界可說是完全隔絕。去年二月十二日我動身到立煌安徽大學去敎書。我想，旣到了自由區，總該可以曉得一點老友們的消息了，誰知並不比在陷區上海好多少。所能得到的一點消息，大都是在重慶所出的「文化新聞」上看到的。我說不淸我自己是太懶還是太忙，總之我不曾自動地寫信去探詢我的朋友們。雖說我到立煌以後，中央社曾經發出消息，各地報紙也都刋載出來，究竟地址不詳細，朋友們即使想寫信給我，也無從寫起。再說：朋友們與我都沒有什麼要緊的話說，或非通信不可，也許這樣，大家都懶了吧？謝六逸曾經寫過一封信給我，自從平漢路被日軍打通，後方被切斷以後，朋友們自然更不容易通信了。只有皖南屯溪的朱雯羅洪夫婦（最近羅洪在正言出版社刋行了一本小說集「這時代」）和福建長汀的施墊存還常寫信給我。寄刋物給我的則有廣西桂林的「新文學」月刋兩期和江西贛縣的靑年報和正氣日報後者每半月出版「文藝專刋」一次，記得孫用的弱小民族文學的介紹最可注意，大的是從世界語譯出來的。（最近他在正言出版社也刋行了一本「保加利亞小說集」）此外浙江東南日報的副刋「東南文藝」，由謝嶽編輯，從第一期起，一直寄給我十幾期，其中有王西彥，林祝敬等人的文章。大的東南文藝界的消息我知道得較多，如施蟄存曹聚仁許欽文等家的文章是常可看到的。福建的「聯合週報」也使我知道了不少的消息。從那上面我又看見了鍾敬文和吳大現的文章。有一次馬一民從重慶坐飛機回來，帶來了「文哨」和「抗戰文藝」，纔在那上面看見郭沬若茅盾老舍諸兄的文章。朋友們寄信和刋物給我，使我感到友情的溫暖。由上面所敍，使我深切的感到，抗戰八年，把文藝界的朋友都打散了，束一處，西一處的不能聚集在一起，桂林和重慶自然是兩個中心。桂林失陷後，只有重慶成爲中心。其他各處，如皖南，皖北，江西，福建，浙江等地雖然只是支流，究竟也各有表現。爲了戰事的影響和交通的阻隔，各地可說是互不通消息，文藝作品也無從交換閱覽。聽說張靜廬預備把重慶所有的文藝書用木船遝到上海廉價傾銷，這倒是一個很好的消息。我希望，至少有人寫一些結總帳的文字，報告各地八年來文藝界的狀况；最好能够像良友「中國新文學大系」那樣，有人肯編一套「抗戰八年問文藝選集」，讓我們這般住在荒島上的人也能多知道一些大後方文學活動的情形。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，我終於回到上海來了。主辦「文化新聞」的魯莽兄我們又見面了，他告訴我，文化新聞，就要在上海出版，而且要改進作風，朱雯羅洪夫婦和曹聚仁也回來了，許多朋友們也回到上海來了。我參加了好些次文藝界的聚餐和茶會，上海又將逐漸成爲文藝界的中心。我是非常地高興，多年不見的老友又可以重相聚首。但是，再一想到實際的出版情形，又並不怎麼高興。別國都已和平了，我們中國還在內戰，交通還不能迅速恢復，報紙還是這樣貴，生活程度還是這樣高。除開明書店，文化生活出版社，時代出版社，萬葉書店等每家稍出了幾本文藝書以外，就很少看見有出版文藝書的。並且，要指出那一本是劃時代的偉大作品，或抗戰期間有什麼大著作，幾乎使我回答不出來。也許有新作家曾經在戰塲上經歷過的，寫過長篇鉅製，還不曾發表，或找不到機會發表，但我們也還不會發掘出來。難道我們中國就沒有寫「火綫下」的巴比塞，「戰中人」的頓茲珂或「啓示錄的四騎士」的伊本納茲麼？我熱烈地希望着戰爭文學偉　著的出現。</p>
<p>記得我在立煌的時候，偶然看見文藝書目，就非常喜悅。書太多，無法也沒有時間細看，當時我想買兩本選集，一本是讀書生活社所代售的常任俠的「現代中國詩選」，還有一本是重慶建國書店所出的徐霞村所編選的「小說五年」。但據說常氏的詩選偏於他所認識的朋友，範圍不甚廣闊。因此我更迫切的希望「抗戰八年間文藝選集」出版之能成爲事實。</p>
<p>現在，中華全國文藝協會上海分會已經開過成立大會，文藝刋物如「文藝復興」「文學界」「文聯」「文章」之類都要在新年創刋，「文藝春秋」「麥籽」常亦繼續出版，上海文壇像「睡美人」那樣長睡了好些年，現在又醒過來了。我總結上回所說，在新年我對於文藝界的希望是：一·編纂「抗戰文藝選集」；二·戰爭文學偉一者的出現；三·文協上海分會能够有一些工作的成績。</p>

<h3>文武相輕</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>世人對於「文人相輕」下了許多批評，其實對於「文武相輕」却也値得一提。</p>
<p>人類的天性，本是愛好和平。所以在「民主世紀」裏，似乎應該說是「筆桿」抬頭的時代。然而爲什麼世界各國還是直在製造「槍桿」？而且弄「筆桿」的朋友還是常佔下風—尤其是在中國？</p>
<p>一般人都作如此想。於是，究竟「筆桿」與「槍桿」那個的分量重？眞是有些越想越糊塗了。「文」可以輕「武」，「武」可以輕「文」，他們好像各有各的道理，其原因也就在此。</p>
<p>許多人都這樣想：亂世宜重武輕文，治世宜重文輕武。這是承受了古代遺留下來的影響，在現代早已不適用了。你說現代的「武」人，假使不懂得政治，還能行麼？所以「武」已離不掉「文」。然而「文」能離得掉「武」麼？試問那一次的政治革命是單靠「筆桿」的？</p>
<p>然而這種的衡量「文」「武」，祇是在皮毛上打滾的談話。講到骨子，祇須問這麼一句：「槍桿」是誰給你發明製造的？是「文」人，還是「武」人？假使原子彈是這次勝利裏最有功勞的「武」器，那末這班弄「筆桿」的科學家，便是最有功績的「文」人。悲哀的是：也許那些有功績的「文」人却也會死在弄原子彈的「武」人手裏，於是爲「武」人相輕而已。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>我常常想：在我的筆下，竟從來不曾寫出過一部喜劇來，倒不是我故意這樣，也許我根本沒有寫喜劇的才能；但有時是受了材料的限制，我不能把一個悲劇的素材，强編派成一個喜劇。自然，也有時材料出自我的揑造，我可能從開頭構思，就打點在悲劇上發展！我並沒有什麼絕對的理由要這樣。在我的潛意識裏，我總覺得：人生，就是一部天然的悲劇。從誕生到老死，一個人要受各種的壓榨：人的，社會的；精神的，物質的；任你有再優裕的環境，你必免不了局部的煩惱！再說，這個世界上，幾乎沒有可以構成喜劇的事蹟。不信，你冷靜地沉思一下，哪樣事，是値得高興的？哪樣事，又是眞正圓滿而完善的？哪樣事，沒有滲進去人的眼淚？呌你哭！哪樣事，沒有缺陷和醜惡？呌你失望！我自己是在這種悲劇氣氛中成長起來的，所以我看一切都用悲劇的眼光，也許我壓根兒就沒有了寫喜劇的心情。同時我想着：根據我上面的理解，人生就是悲劇的人生；世界就是悲劇的世界；那麼，誰不願看看自我生活的寫照；誰不願看看這個自我存在的世界之眞實形態！有人說：這是我不健康的表現。但我否認！我以爲：並不是我不健康，乃是各方面的現實不健康。我生平不善於寫粉飾性的文字，正如我作人，不習於講假話一樣。宇宙上最可珍貴的，是眞實樸素；因此，我們爲什麼非要掩蓋「眞實」；暴露虛僞呢？我們心裏難過了，想哭就哭，何必强裝笑臉？一件東西壞了；或是一件事情失敗了；我們就爽爽快快地承認，何必硬要强調牠：那是「缺陷美」？可是話又要說回來，我也很希望寫寫喜劇，甚而我企圖製造喜劇。「寫」喜劇，我還不竹嘗試過，「製造」喜劇，我倒已有過兩次的經騐。但是慚愧的很，我所製造的喜劇，都失收了！好像上帝註定了我這個人是一個悲劇的作者！</p>
<p>寫喜劇失敗，我不在乎，因爲那只是個人的損傷。而製造喜劇失敗，我痛苦，因爲那是許多人的損傷！第一次製造喜劇失敗，是失敗在我一位最好的朋友身上；所幸那只是局部的失敗。第二次失收，便是失敗在我這部小說的男女主人公身上，而這是全盤失敗。但，這種『失敗』，並非我存心「撒賴汚」，致於失敗，說句迷信話，簡直是「神遭鬼使』，讓我失敗！失敗到人力不可以挽救，失敗到令　不會相信那是事實！儘管對於這種失敗，我沒有責任，然而我的內心却很負疚！</p>
<p>記得當我製造的這部喜劇拉開序幕——也就是小說中的男女主人公舉行結婚典禮這天，我曾以介紹人的身份說過這樣幾句話，我說：『我一向是寫劇本的，今天倒要担任一次導演。我對於我的兩位主角都非常滿意，我希望我導演的這部戲，全部成功，一幕比一幕精彩，一幕比一幕有效果……』我的話當時博得不少觀衆的　聲。同時我送了他們一幅對聯，我套了幾句成語寫上去，上聯名：「婦唱夫隨珠聯璧合」，下聯是「雙宿雙飛花好月圓」。這幅對聨事後卻被人指摘出毛病來了，那位朋友告訴我：「毛病」就在這「雙宿雙飛」四個字上。我問他是什麼意思？他堅決不講，我緊着逼他，他才半打趣半認眞地說：『橫豎不吉利，好在童言無忌，沒什麼關係！』我聽了這話毫不以爲然，我把他作爲開玩笑的無稽之談。自古以來，誰不知道「雙宿雙飛」，是一句吉利詞，但這位婆婆媽媽的朋友來作如此的曲解，於是我立刻眞想駡他荒謬，可是後來竟然變成了不是他曲解，是我「曲解」；不是他荒謬，是我「荒謬」；雙宿雙飛果眞不是喜劇的寓意，而是悲劇的寓意；他不但推翻了我的成見，而且推翻了歷史的成見！從此，我明白了他這「不吉利」的註釋確有道理，因此我就用這不吉利的成語作我道小說的標題，一則，我要糾正我和歷史的荒謬，我警告大家今後不再拿這四個字常吉利詞。二則，我要紀念這件眞實得離奇的悲劇之發生。也許乍看又有人以爲我寫的是喜劇了。甚或有人誤會我是爲了生意經，故意無聊地取這個俗氣的題目，好迎合低級趣味。其實，都不然。嚴格地講，這個悲劇固不是我存心製造的，也不是真正雙突雙飛這四個字帶來的。那麽，到底是誰的罪惡呢？是彌留在舊社會上的喪失倫理，喪失人道的黑暗勢力！是這次國際強盜　揭起的戰爭！在這種可怕的勢力下，在這次殘酷的戰爭裏；像這樣悲慘的故事實在太多了！這兒只是叙述了一件，又在這一件故事裏也只是犧牲了幾個人！還有無數的這類被犧牲的人，他們的寃魂將永遠向這種彌留在舊社會上的「黑暗勢力」，和這次強盜　揭起的「戰爭」提起控訴！是的，我便是被委托的一個寫狀人！現在，我願意樸樸素素地描繪這個故事，也就是爲這故事中的幾位寃魂，以及所有被犧牲的寃魂，寫下一件向時代控告黑暗勢力與戰爭的狀子！同時我代他們向時代要求兩個具體賠償損失的條件，便是：新社會的誕生，眞正和平的光臨！假如，這兩個條件不能兌現，我想，那些敗訴的寃魂們，定是死也不會瞑目的！</p>
<p>末了，我要聲明：這部小說所描寫的故事，雖然眞實，但爲了要把它「小說」化的原故，少不得在情節土加以穿插和勇裁。我希望　不會因此受到與這個故事有關的第三者之非非難！</p>
<p>走筆至此，雄鷄報曉！窗外透進一綫黎明，我於是揭開卅五年的第一頁日曆，停筆步出廊外，伸伸腰；深深吸了一口淸新的空氣；然後懷着滿腔的熱情，跪向蒼天；虔誠地爲那些無辜的寃魂們，同時爲我們這羣活在苦悶中的人，迎候着新年帶來「新社會的誕生」，以及，「眞正和平的光臨」！</p>
<h3>陽光</h3>
<p>— 登臨</p>
<p>在一棵禿了頂的法國梧桐前，我停住了脚。</p>
<p>孩子孤獨地竚立着，烏溜的眼珠飄了我一眼。</p>
<p>「准不？」我有些奇怪他的能耐，在這料峭的西風裏。</p>
<p>「冷？」他也同樣奇怪我的問話。但立刻肯定的說：「不！」</p>
<p>孩子該是最天眞的，如果周圖不給他一種誘力。</p>
<p>「爲什麼？」我開始走近他的身子。握住了那豐織小細嫩的手，我發現它已被凍得鮮紅。驟然的悲哀湧進了心靈……</p>
<p>怪道世界是這麼混濁，連孩子也懂得了欺騙。</p>
<p>「看那陽光！」</p>
<p>「哦！」我笑起我的愚蠢來。</p>
<p>任世界怎麼悽凉，最不幸的命運該是降在失去了陽光的一羣。……</p>
<h3>應鵬畫讚</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>一切事業，不外乎人格的表現，尤其是文章與書畫，最爲表現得淸楚。文章書畫一落虐僞，便像紙紥的花朶，儘管好看，毫無生命。</p>
<p>文章書畫表現人格是自然的事，然而要如何表現得格外眞切，格外鮮明，那是要一番修鍊的，愈修鍊得深刻，表現得便格外眞切動人，鮮明澈底。</p>
<p>像中國山水畫，一般人看來，似難表現人格，以其對象只是無靈的木石。實則山水畫是最能表現個有的人格的。須知能盡山水的人，共人品已經不錯，如果畫得好，自然人格更高。因爲要畫山水，第一要具有山水的胸襟，高曠遠大，毫無一點俗念才畫得出大自然的本色。假使人格不佳的人，他便想不到山水的幽玄，看不出山水的偉大，更感不到山水的精神，所以儘管有不少的匠人，勉强混充解人，畫出來的山水到底還是一股匠氣，絕無一點山水風雅之緻的。</p>
<p>中國山水畫實在眞難畫，你想把毫無生氣的石頭，要畫得通靈的，那是多麼的困難啊！而眞的山水，我們在何地方欣賞時便覺得山水眞是有靈的。我原來看不懂山水畫。後來經過幾年看山水畫的訓練，居然看懂了，而且愈看山水畫愈覺有興味。在抗戰的八年間，沒有閒情逸微看畫，而且也沒有好山水畫供給我觀摩。最近隨着勝利的來臨，讀到了朱應鵬君的許多山水畫，眞呌我拍案呌絕，一掃這八年來沒有看山水的苦悶。應鵬的作畫，雖則畫是小幅，但尺幅之間，具有千里萬里之勢，都是創作，沒有一幅有藍本，而幅幅有章法，其中佳者，簡直能攝山水的精靈，彷彿將山水的生命都躍如地描繪了出來。從應鵬山水的精妙中顯示出他人格的高潔。應鵬在富今渾濁的上海，是卓然最具有品格的人。抗戰八年之間，不僅從不向敵僞稍低一回頭，反之，經常用他最犀利的　鋒向敵僞投擲了無數的文章炸彈的。但是勝利之後，他仍如一泓秋水，平靜明澈，有他這種態度，有他這種人格，所以能寫得那麼清秀妍麗的山水。不僅山水畫得好，應鵬的人物花卉也與一般不同，人物是有解剖學做基礎的，花卉則有生物學做根底的，而其設色之妙，更爲有目所共賞。像有一盆花，那花朶的顏色，簡直像西洋粉筆所繪，令人讚賞不置。總之，應鵬的畫，有人品，有修養，確是佳構。</p>

        <h1>1946 - n04</h1>
<h3>Government and Communist Party Continue Talks; Agreement Largely Reached on Ceasing Conflict and Restoring Transportation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 3rd] U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, has been meeting with various parties in recent days to listen to opinions, but has maintained silence, preventing continued progress. However, according to a representative of the Communist Party, the Communist Party seems unwilling to resolve the issues of restoring transportation and accepting surrender simultaneously with the cessation of conflict. Public opinion from all sides hopes that the Communist Party will no longer adhere to preconceived notions and will provide a satisfactory response soon. Former Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, is scheduled to host a banquet today to entertain Communist Party representatives to celebrate the New Year.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Office] San Francisco broadcasted at midnight on the 3rd: The third round of unity negotiations between the National Government and the Communist Party continued this afternoon in Chongqing. The outcome is unclear. Prior to this round, three meetings had been held since December 27th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Government representatives Chairman Zhang Qun and Minister Wang Shijie, along with Secretary-General Li Ziyi, met with Chinese Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Huang Biwu, Ye Jianying, and Wang Ruofei for further talks at 5:30 PM on the 3rd. A response telegram has been received from Yan'an. Both sides have largely agreed on measures to cease conflict and restore transportation and will continue discussions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] The government's proposed ceasefire plan seems largely acceptable to Yan'an, but the suggestion of restoring railway transportation remains an obstacle. According to well-informed sources here, it is unlikely that the Communist Party will unconditionally accept the ceasefire plan (including the restoration of transportation), with U.S. Special Envoy Marshall participating in a tripartite committee to mediate the ceasefire. The Communist Party is not necessarily opposed to Marshall serving as mediator. Their primary objection is abandoning the railway issue. The Communist Party insists on an unconditional cessation of conflict before railway transportation is restored and other issues are discussed. Authoritative sources here feel that even if a ceasefire agreement is reached, it is unlikely to be implemented before further meetings. The entire situation is delicate and complex and should not be lightly speculated upon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Yan'an, 3rd] The Communist Party has formally submitted a response today to the government authorities' ceasefire proposal, stating that they are "prepared to discuss various suggestions regarding an immediate ceasefire and the implementation of unity and democracy, in order to promote their realization." A Communist Party spokesperson added that the Communist Party welcomes Chairman Chiang's proposal to invite U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, to participate in the negotiations. They also agree with the proposal to appoint other impartial individuals, such as the Democratic League, to form a military observation group.</p>
<p>Marshall's Busy Schedule Continues; Meets with Various Parties</p>
<p>[Report from Our Office] San Francisco broadcasted at midnight on the 3rd: General Marshall met with many representatives from various sectors of Chinese society in Chongqing today, including Bishop Yu Bin, President of Peking University Chuan Sinnian, Shang Zhen, and Bai Chongxi. Shang Zhen also held a confidential one-hour meeting with Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Zhou Enlai also attended the meeting today after holding a half-hour conversation with U.S. Special Envoy Marshall. Zhou also met with Marshall on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, United Press] The U.S. State Department announced today that Walter S. Robertson, Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Spain, has been appointed as the economic and financial advisor to U.S. Special Envoy Marshal during his mission in China and will perform his duties throughout his tenure. [Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] It is reported that when the Political Consultative Conference opens on the 10th, Chairman Chiang will be unable to preside over every session due to official duties and will be replaced by Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke. President Sun is one of the eight representatives from the government side.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] The Washington Post stated in an editorial today: Hopes for peace in China seem stronger than at any time in recent memory, but one should not hastily conclude that the crisis between Chongqing and Yan'an has been eliminated. All parties agree on ending the bloodshed, but this superficial unity often masks irreconcilable differences in methods. Under such circumstances, it is still too early to say that the warring parties will lay down their arms and that peace will descend upon this war-torn land.</p>
<h3>Before Responding to Ceasefire Proposal, Communist Party Claims It Will Fight for Jehol; National Army Entering Jehol Reaches Chaoyang</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] According to a government report, the Central Army has entered Fuxin, the center of coal, gold, and silver mines in Jehol Province. [Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] The Central Army is currently entering Jehol in force. The Communist Party has declared that the Communist forces will fight for Jehol and resist the attack, calling it "civil war." At a time when the entire nation is awaiting the Communist Party's response to the government's ceasefire proposal to end the internal conflict, the Communist Party unexpectedly made this declaration. A Communist Party spokesperson previously stated that the government's taking over Jehol was a natural matter. The National Army's entry into Jehol is seen as the starting point for an attempt to expel the Communist forces from Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 3rd] The National Army heading to Jehol has reached Chaoyang. The airfield and its facilities there have been destroyed by Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Yan'an, 3rd] The Eighth Route Army Headquarters of the Communist Party reported today on the military situation, stating that the Central Army is advancing along the Baotou-Datong railway line and is now only ten to twenty li away from Jining City in Suiyuan Province. To the east, the Central Army has concentrated 80,000 troops in the triangular area between Beiping, Gubeikou, and Nankou, with reinforcements arriving continuously. Their destination is Chengde, the capital of Jehol Province. At the same time, the Central Army in the Guisui and Datong areas will head to Zhangjiakou, the capital of Chahar Province. On the Shandong front, the Communist forces on the Jinpu Railway occupied Yucheng (located ninety li north of Jinan) on December 30th. 80,000 National Army troops have arrived in Hanzhuang. In the border areas of Henan and Hubei, the 5th Division of the Communist New Fourth Army has been surrounded. The Central Army's destination in that area is Xinyang in southern Henan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The 80-kilometer section of the southern Datong-Pukou Railway between Hongdong and Fujiatan has been previously destroyed by Communist forces. Many rails have been thrown into the Fen River and mountain valleys, and the sleepers have been completely burned. The roadbed has been dug into deep, tooth-shaped trenches. Although the railway workers have been working around the clock to repair it, the damage is too great to be restored in the short term.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Life in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>Since Christmas, Chongqing has had sunny weather for days. Special Envoy Marshall loves foggy Chongqing and loves the sunshine that appears after dispersing the thick fog. In the past week, he has met with many people. Whenever he sees off a visiting guest, he looks up at the clear sky with a joyful expression on his face.</p>
<p>Marshal lives in Yiyuan. His bedroom is a small room with comfortable equipment and simple decoration. His office is also located in the garden. He does not often go to the American Embassy. The other day, he had all the files and materials moved from the embassy to Yiyuan.</p>
<p>Marshal always gets up at 7:30 AM and rests at 10:00 PM. In addition to meeting guests, he pays special attention to reading the editorials of various Chinese newspapers translated and sent by the United States Information Service every day. He personally uses a hand-operated machine to telegraph important reports to the United States government.</p>
<p>Marshal loves horseback riding. Since coming to Chongqing, he has been too busy with official duties, so he uses massage instead. The headquarters of the U.S. Army in China has specially selected a Chinese barber for him, who gets up at 7:00 AM every morning to massage Marshal's back for half an hour. The barber is willing to serve this distinguished guest without receiving any compensation. Marshal brought a chef with him, who is an American-Chinese named Jiang Xianquan. His cooking skills are excellent. The Bureau of Foreign Affairs sends personnel to prepare the vegetables and food he needs every day.</p>
<p>Marshal loves flowers. In addition to ordering thousands of yuan worth of fresh flowers every day, visiting guests often bring flowers as gifts.</p>
<p>Marshal lives in Yiyuan. The Bureau of Foreign Affairs specially sent Liaison Officer Liu Wu to take care of everything. This person has become a target for reporters to interview, but his words are cautious and comparable to Marshal. Marshal's bodyguards are strong, alert, and amiable and are also Marshal's capable assistants.</p>
<p>Yiyuan has strict security. The gate is busy with traffic and frequent guests. The staff of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs are very busy. The staff of the bureau must wear AB badges when entering and exiting.</p>
<p>Marshal loves to read, especially biographies of famous people and history. He brought many books with him this time, most of which are abridged novels printed by the U.S. military. He reads one book every night.</p>
<p>Marshal lived in the Philippines for a long time when he was young. When he came to China this time and passed through Manila, a Filipino ran to the Marshal, claiming that he had served under Marshall when he was in the Philippines in his early years. Marshal, at the age of 65, still remembered this person and shook his hand, which was widely praised.</p>
<p>On December 31st of last month, it was Marshal's 65th birthday. Madame Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet to celebrate his birthday. (Sent from Chongqing on New Year's Day)</p>
<h3>National Army Awaits Orders to Enter Xinmin; Detailed Measures for Taking Over Discussed Very Satisfactorily; Airlift Delayed Again Due to Weather</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 3rd] After repeated delays, the airlift of the National Army from North China to Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang was originally scheduled to take off yesterday, but was obstructed again due to bad weather. According to the Northeast Headquarters, the airlift can take place this weekend if the weather is good. At the same time, the army of Du Yuming is near Xinmin, awaiting orders to enter the city. Du is still negotiating with Soviet liaison officers, but progress is going smoothly. Each provincial government, with the assistance of Soviet liaison officers, will gradually take over. The Soviet army is still scheduled to complete its withdrawal on February 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 3rd] Regarding the detailed measures for our army to enter Xinmin, Colonel Section Chief Wang Kanxi, led his entourage to Xinmin to contact the Soviet side. The result was very satisfactory. The East Road takeover force advanced from Dahushan along the highway to Dahuangqibao, six kilometers from Xinmin, at noon on the 3rd. The Right Road takeover force also advanced from Dahushan along the railway to Liuhegou, nine kilometers from Xinmin, at the same time. Mr. Wang Kan waited for the takeover force to reach the two destinations and then closely contacted the Soviet liaison personnel to take over the defense of the Xinmin urban area. General Peng Bisheng, who is negotiating with the Soviet side for the takeover, will depart from Jinzhou tomorrow morning and go directly to Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Director Xiong Shihui met with Tianjin reporters at 5:00 PM on the 2nd for a ten-minute conversation. This was Xiong's first contact with the press since arriving in the north. According to him, the purpose of this trip was to inspect the situation in Tianjin, which has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Headquarters, and he will return to Beiping in a few days. Regarding the airlift to the Northeast, it was originally scheduled to start transporting to Changchun on the 30th, but it may have to be delayed for another two or three days due to heavy snow and unsuitable flying weather in various places. Regarding the takeover situation, Xiong said that the mayors of Changchun, Shenyang, and Harbin have taken office, and personnel from each province will also be sent by the Soviet side to accompany them to take over in succession. As for the troops leaving the pass by land, the liaison personnel sent by the Soviet side have already met, and Director Du's troops will arrive in Xinmin and then go to Shenyang. Xiong said in response to reporters that the Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from the Northeast before February 1st. Regarding the Northeast disaster relief work, the Disaster Relief Administration has sent personnel to investigate. Although the current food supply is still sufficient, cotton cloth and other items are in great shortage.</p>
<h3>National Flags and White Snow Shine on Harbin; Mayor Yang Takes Office on New Year's Day; Zhang Jia'ao Meets with Soviet Officials Twice</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 3rd] Harbin, the center of the five northeastern provinces, held a new mayor's inauguration ceremony and celebrated New Year's Day at the new city hall at 10:30 AM on New Year's Day. Zhang Jia'ao presided over the oath-taking ceremony. Soviet Consul General Baretsiv, Director of the China Changchun Railway Bureau Zhuraukov, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Garrison Command in Harbin Guolieskuofu, and representatives from all walks of life, as well as more than a thousand municipal officials, attended the ceremony. Zhang said in his speech that he hoped that Harbin would start a new atmosphere from today and build a new Harbin under the leadership of Mayor Yang. Consul General Ba also expressed his ardent hopes for the future of New Harbin. Later, when Mayor Yang met with thousands of citizens at the gate of the city hall, the citizens cheered wildly. The enthusiastic situation was deeply moving. In addition, the Harbin branch of the Central Bank officially opened today. The internal equipment of the bank is still complete. Mayor Yang, Consul General Ba, Manager Baishayav of the Soviet Far East Bank, and local dignitaries all went to congratulate. The Harbin branch of the Bank of China is scheduled to resume business on the 3rd, and other banks are sealed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 1st] After arriving here on the 29th, Zhang Jia'ao had two meetings with Lieutenant General Maksimov, commander of the Soviet garrison in northern Northeast China. The first time was at the party held by Commander Ma on New Year's Eve. That night, Mr. Zhang and Commander Ma sat opposite each other, exchanging toasts. Famous Soviet artists performed dances and songs to add to the fun, and Mr. Zhang also danced. The grand event did not end until 3:00 AM. The second time was on New Year's Day. Both gatherings were very pleasant. Our takeover work in northern Northeast China will proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 31st] (Delayed) Harbin has been sunny and clear these days. The outdoor temperature this morning was minus 30 degrees Celsius. Slogans welcoming central personnel and national flags shine with the color of snow, with a special style. With the advent of the New Year, shops will be closed for three days from this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 2nd] The population of Harbin, claimed to be 800,000, is actually slightly over 700,000. Before the restoration, statistics of Soviet citizens were 1,845, White Russians were 4,838, and Japanese were more than 90,000. Since the Soviet army stationed in Harbin, White Russians have been allowed to enter the Soviet nationality, and all those who register are approved.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Compared with Changchun, prices here are cheaper for food and higher for other items. Pork (the following are the same unit), 14 yuan, white rice 3.5 yuan, white flour 10 yuan, millet 2 yuan, sorghum rice 1.2 yuan, and a suit of western clothes about 10,000 yuan. Harbin is surrounded by abundant grain reserves, and the countryside is substantial. When reporters walked along the Songhua River, they saw a large team of pack animals carrying grain, hundreds of them, entering the city. Some families, due to insufficient coal, use soybean cakes and other fuels instead.</p>
<h3>Tannu Tuva in Northern Outer Mongolia Actually Incorporated into Soviet Territory; 31 Years Ago, It Was Originally Under Our Country's Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] According to a Moscow dispatch in today's London Times, the former Tannu Tuva Republic, located along the Bakal Lake Road on the northern border of Outer Mongolia, has been formally incorporated into the Soviet Union. Tannu Tuva, now renamed "Tuva Province," has an area of 64,000 square miles. The area was originally part of Outer Mongolia and was under Chinese jurisdiction before 1914. In that year, it was designated as a protectorate by Imperial Russia. After the Russian Revolution, Tuva became an "independent people's republic." In 1926, it concluded a treaty with the Soviet Union. The population consists of 100,000 people, mostly Tuva people (of the Turkic race) and Russians, with small minorities of Chinese and Mongolians. It also has a president and a parliament and has issued stamps.</p>
<h3>Army Headquarters Prepares to Close; General He Will Go to England</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Conditions for Successful Political Consultation</h3>
<p>The first New Year's Day after victory has fleetingly passed, and the New Year is already on its fourth day. These four days should be four days of universal celebration, yet there are still some places in China where the people do not have the fortune to "celebrate together"! Everyone has heard that the Political Consultative Conference will be convened on the 10th, like a sick person obtaining a panacea; taking one pill will surely turn danger into safety. We also hope that this can really be the case, and that we can earnestly implore it to be so. If the consultation succeeds, political disputes are resolved, and the peaceful and stable environment that Chairman Chiang spoke of can be created, the people can truly "celebrate together" the Spring Festival, those going home can return home early, those being demobilized can be demobilized early, and everyone can happily drink a cup of Spring Festival wine. Consultation, consultation, the whole world looks up to this consultation to be successful.</p>
<p>However, an editorial in the Washington Post says that while the hope for peace in China is quite strong, one should be careful not to say that the crisis has been eliminated. The appearance of a unified goal often contains differing opinions that cannot be reconciled. Initially, we thought that foreign criticism might be too harsh, but according to yesterday's Yan'an telegram, the Communist Party, while responding to the government's proposal to stop the sudden conflict plan, saying it was prepared to discuss it, firmly insisted on demanding that "the National Army withdraw from Rehe". This will be considered the beginning of a true "civil war". Judging from the Communist Party's two-faced approach, indeed, the American newspaper's view that it is too early to be optimistic is a judgment that understands the Communist Party and is close to the facts. Originally, national affairs, according to reason and law, should be handled as they should be, and there is a track to follow, without the need for any consultation. Now that consultation is required, it is clear that the parties to the consultation must have a spirit of mutual understanding and compromise in order to hope for success. We must first ask: Does the government have this spirit? Does the Communist Party have this spirit? If consultation is spoken of verbally, while weapons are wielded in hand, then what is the use of consultation? Chairman Chiang broadcasted at the beginning of the year, announcing to the military and civilians: "The government must be as open as possible to politics and implement democracy in advance, and the national army must be under the command of the state and obey the government." He also said: "Before the National Assembly is convened, we are prepared to recruit social elites and people from various parties to participate in the government," "It's just that the parties participating in the government cannot possess an autonomous army to use as a tool for political strife." If the government can achieve these key points word for word, not only can the government show its democratic magnanimity and spirit of mutual understanding and compromise, but also the people's peaceful life and work, and the country's strength and unity, can all be based on this. However, what about the Communist Party?</p>
<p>The National Army's entry into Rehe is part of the surrender acceptance work. This is a fact known to both China and foreign countries, and it is related to our country's obligations to its allies. What reason does the Communist Party have to obstruct it? Moreover, the Communist Party had earlier acknowledged that "the government's acceptance of Rehe is a matter of course." Why does it now seem to have forgotten this statement, and instead say that the National Army's entry into Rehe will be the beginning of a true "civil war"? Seeing the Communist Army's movements in northern Jiangsu and Shandong, as well as the continuous transfer of Communist troops from northern Shaanxi to Rehe and Suiyuan, it is even more evident that while the Communist Party sent representatives to the capital to negotiate with the central government, it never stopped military actions in various important areas for a single day. As for asking it to "return the army to the state," it is especially unknown how many years it will take. What crimes have the people committed that the Communist Party must make them unable to happily celebrate even a New Year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War?</p>
<p>The Communist Party vigorously promoted the proposal of "unconditional ceasefire" before the New Year, but in fact, the so-called "unconditional" three measures were intended to "freeze" the National Army in its current defense areas, making it impossible for the National Army to complete the work of accepting surrender, disarming, and repatriating prisoners, and the Communist Party could take the opportunity to replenish its military strength and consolidate its territory, in preparation for another war when the consultation stalled. If it really harbors this kind of scheming intention to participate in the consultation, it will inevitably lack sincerity. "Without sincerity, there is nothing." What else is there to talk about consultation? It is enough to make our people worry. Although the government wants to invite Special Envoy Marshall to be an intermediary mediator, and the Communist Party also expresses its agreement, whether the consultative conference can be convened smoothly and achieve complete success in this atmosphere, we dare not make a conclusion today.</p>
<p>However, the future Political Consultative Conference can only be hoped to succeed, and cannot be allowed to fail. Because if this medicine is no longer effective, if speaking is not allowed, then hands must be used, and the people will naturally be unable to avoid the disaster of war again. Then, what exactly can promote the success of the consultative conference? The first is to be sincere with each other, the second is to understand each other, and the third is to be absolutely open.</p>
<p>A political party is a group that implements political advocacy. It is not necessary to shy away from political disputes for the sake of political advocacy. It should be commonplace. Debating and even clamoring for political disputes is also commonplace in democratic countries, and there is nothing strange about it. But whether it is debating or clamoring, all political disputes must be based on sincerity. What I advocate is what it is, and there must be no disguise. For example, if the Kuomintang believes in the Three Principles of the People, it must implement the Three Principles of the People; and since the Communist Party now avoids mentioning communism, but says it is willing to fight for the Three Principles of the People, then it must no longer use the Three Principles of the People as a disguise. Today, everyone says not to fight, and everyone must really not fight. But the three words "not to fight" cannot be used to prevent the National Army from carrying out the work of accepting surrender and repatriating prisoners, and especially cannot use the three words "not to fight" as a talisman for "not allowing others to fight back, only allowing me to hit others". When the meeting is held to discuss matters, there must be no more playing with words, and there must be absolute sincerity in implementation, so that the meeting can succeed.</p>
<p>Secondly, the spirit of democratic politics lies in being able to tolerate the other party, and it lies in being able to understand the other party. Because two people who originally do not understand each other at all, living in one place, not only have no qualification to be friends at all, but also do not even have the qualification to be enemies. They must gradually understand, to the point of thoroughly understanding, and then those who agree can be friends, and those who disagree can be enemies. Mrs. Roosevelt said that she does not like the word "tolerance" because tolerance is still forced. She believes that one must first seek mutual understanding, and then one can like each other. Special Envoy Marshall also said at the New Year's Eve Security Council meeting that there must be cooperation, understanding, and patience, and then peace will be guaranteed. Therefore, the parties to the consultation, whether they are political friends or political enemies, should all start by understanding the other party. Understand the other party's doctrine, understand the other party's policies, understand the other party's main figures, understand the other party's true demands, understand the other party's usual style, everything must be fully understood, and then they can understand, tolerate, and accommodate each other, and turn hostility into friendship. The Political Consultative Conference will have a bright future.</p>
<p>Finally, this Political Consultative Conference is a temporary emergency medicine before the convening of the National Assembly, and it is of great importance to the country and the nation. The success or failure of the conference is not only a matter for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, nor is it only a matter for various parties and factions, but a major matter concerning the safety and well-being of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the people have the necessity of questioning, and if it fails, they especially have the sovereignty to pursue responsibility. In the parliament of a democratic country, no matter what debates there are, except for absolutely confidential cases, there are generally detailed records in the newspapers, and public opinion can also make free criticisms. Only in this way is there political struggle but no military struggle. Who is right and who is wrong will be judged by public opinion, without the need to use knives and guns. The Political Consultative Conference should learn from the fact that previous discussions on the Communist Party problem have not yielded much, change its style, and not regard consultation as a rare commodity, but should regard making it public to the people as the only way to seek a proper solution. Then, if one side's approach is unreasonable, and one side's argument is unreasonable, the people will naturally have public opinion to convince it. No party can use secrecy to deceive the people and evade its own responsibility, and attribute the blame for the rupture to the other party. Moreover, the gentlemen participating in the conference should understand that they are not representatives elected by the people. Whether they can make sense of the country's affairs and agree on politics today, in terms of reason, principle, and law, remains to be seen by the people. Therefore, only by making it public to the people can the consultative conference be forced to succeed.</p>

<h3>Japanese War Power Completely Destroyed; Foundation for Democracy Established: MacArthur's Comprehensive Report on the Administration of Japan Published</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] The Department of the Army today released General MacArthur's first comprehensive report on his stationing in Japan, stating: "If food is not imported as needed, Japan may face famine within three months." The report states that at least 3,311,000 tons of food are needed for Japan. The report consists of several large volumes, covering a wide range of topics, such as the rampant black market in Japanese yen, industrial chaos, and farmers suffering from typhoons and floods, all of which are described in detail.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] A report to the U.S. Department of the Army by Ike Ach has been released today. It states that the demobilization of the Japanese army is proceeding rapidly and smoothly, without any incidents. On September 1, 1945, the total strength of the Japanese army and navy in Japan was 4 million, and there were still 3.34 million army and navy personnel assigned to various occupied territories. By October 15, the Japanese army had ceased to exist, and the navy had virtually disintegrated. The main objective of the United Nations' occupation of Japan is to thoroughly destroy the industrial base of Japan's war power, and it is now fully committed to achieving this goal. In addition to the destructive power of wartime air raids and other attacks, various methods have been used to reduce Japan's war potential to a negligible level. Japan has lost its colonial raw materials, and its foreign trade and shipping have been subjected to control, which has greatly reduced its economic capacity. The current economic situation in Japan is very pitiful, the industry is out of balance, and raw materials are about to run out. The food supply in 1946 is particularly worrying. The report also stated that the U.S. military stationed in Japan is the main factor in determining Japan's future, and the U.S. military's actions in Japan are exemplary. The occupying authorities have taken positive steps to lay the foundation for Japanese democracy, but during the two months of occupation, the Japanese government has made few suggestions for basic reforms towards democracy. Political activities have been hampered by the people's focus on clothing, food, and housing, and it is unrealistic to expect the people to participate in politics naturally and widely. As for democracy, the Japanese have no experience, with only feudalism and totalitarianism as their background. Tens of millions of farmers and women, in general, have virtually no knowledge of politics.</p>
<p>Three Measures Proposed for Requisitioning Japanese Labor</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of requisitioning Japanese labor, MacArthur has proposed three measures: (1) Japan should export labor to serve as compensation, limited to specialized personnel, to install and manage relocated industrial equipment. (2) Technical and management personnel originally in China, Korea, and the three northeastern provinces should be retained, as they are indispensable for stabilizing the economies of these regions. (3) Japanese civilians and soldiers who are idle in the South Pacific islands can be used to rebuild damaged areas or engage in new construction.</p>
<p>Thorough Reform of Japanese Education System</p>
<p>MacArthur's report then discussed the Japanese education system, stating that a thorough reform plan has been drafted, and it is hoped that a survey team will be sent to Japan in the future to assist in the aftermath of the entire school system. A plan is currently being drafted to allow returning soldiers and wartime workers to re-enter universities. When Japan surrendered, the entire national education system had virtually come to a standstill, 18 million students and 4,000 schools were destroyed, and teachers were full of nationalistic ideas. Now, all military schools have been sealed off, and courses that are considered obstructive have been removed. The transformation of personnel and students is now being carried out using radio, and efforts have begun to promote educational institutions and increase textbooks to meet the needs. The selection of teachers and staff in Japanese schools after the war is also under strict investigation, and all teachers who are deemed to be obstructive have been dismissed. Returning soldiers are also temporarily not allowed to engage in education and must wait for a detailed investigation before a decision is made.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Implementing Partitioned Governance Policy in Korea</p>
<p>Regarding the Korean issue, MacArthur said that Korea will be divided into two parts, north and south, and administered separately by the United States and the Soviet Union. In terms of policies and actions, many problems inevitably arise. Koreans are very concerned about the north-south division, but progress has already been made in the north. Restoring rail traffic with northern Korea, which is occupied by the Soviet Union, is also an urgent issue. In terms of internal affairs, laws enacted and implemented by Japan that are deemed obstructive have been abolished. In the courts, Japanese judges have been replaced by Koreans, and the same measures have been taken in the police force. The practice of police officers punishing criminals without interrogation has been strictly prohibited. There are a total of 2 million Koreans in Japan, including 350,000 who were conscripted. 160,000 people have been sent back to Korea as of last October.</p>

According to Dutch sources, in the Tumbak region southeast of Semarang, Allied patrols and Indonesian extremists who were holding fortified positions engaged in "organized warfare". There were also conflicts in Semarang and Bodensorg yesterday. Indonesian leaders are trying to restore political control over these two areas, but it seems that they are also unable to control the extremists.

<h3>Zhejiang Province to Allocate 700,000 Piculs of Accumulated Grain Starting This Year</h3>
<p>For Reconstruction of Post-War Education</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Hangzhou] Zhejiang Provincial Secondary Schools had planned to fully restore operations within six months. Recently, many secondary school principals from various provinces have arrived in the province and have repeatedly discussed the work of restoring operations. According to the principals, the current work of restoring operations is quite difficult because both funding and school buildings are problematic. One principal said: "The provincial government previously approved a temporary loan of 50 million yuan from local banks for the restoration of operations, but it has not yet been allocated. I am afraid that everyone will come with enthusiasm and leave with disappointment." Moreover, the public grain for general schools has been in arrears for more than seven months. Neither grain money nor grain has been issued, even for those with fewer arrears, it is three or four months. Teachers and students are struggling to cook. As for the public grain for subsidized and normal school students, in the past, the provincial government had been considerate of the hardships of these students and issued six months of grain each semester. It is heard that the financial authorities intend to change to issuing five months, which has caused great anxiety among poor students in various schools, who hope that the rumors are not true. However, it is heard that at the recent administrative meeting, Chairman Huang put forward the slogan "Education First" and, starting this year, plans to allocate 700,000 piculs of accumulated grain to meet the needs of restoring post-war education in the province. Education circles are greatly excited upon hearing this.</p>

<h3>Nazi Deputy Führer Bormann is Dead</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] After a detailed investigation into the deeds of Nazi leaders, a special investigation team has confirmed that Nazi Party leader and Deputy Führer Bormann has died. Bormann was one of the defendants in the Nuremberg trials and is currently being tried in absentia. He was in the bunker of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin with Hitler and Eva Braun. Before the Red Army captured Berlin, Hitler and his remaining followers agreed to commit suicide. Bormann was also one of the signatories. However, after Hitler's death, Bormann became greedy for life. According to information received, he drove out with a tank, trying to escape Berlin, but the tank was hit by Soviet artillery fire, and a shell fragment cut off Bormann's head. In the bunker of the Reich Chancellery, Bormann recorded every word of those who participated in the suicide. This record was originally intended to be released by mysterious means, making it one of the greatest chapters in German history. Several people who escaped from the bunker have met the same fate as Bormann, which is difficult to determine at present. Some of them may have been arrested. One of them is Hitler's chauffeur, Kempka, who first revealed that Bormann had participated in the suicide agreement, as did a female aircraft pilot, who was the last to fly out of Berlin in her aircraft.</p>

<h3>French Warship Illegally Leaves Shanghai with Detainee; Our Authorities File Serious Protest; Foreign Affairs Office Publishes Details of Negotiations</h3>
<p>After the news of the French Consulate General in Shanghai illegally arresting French Nazi criminals spread, all circles here were deeply shocked and indignant at the French side's contempt for our national sovereignty. It is understood that Mr. Kakopino, a French official of the former French Municipal Council, was arrested by the French consular police on December 3rd of last year and detained in the French barracks on Béthune Road for four weeks. At 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, he was escorted by the French Consulate authorities to the Beil Ding cruiser, which arrived here on the 24th of last month to evacuate French troops and French overseas Chinese. It was scheduled to leave Shanghai at 11 a.m. on the 3rd for Saigon for trial. After receiving the news, the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai and the Municipal Government believed that the warship's mission to Shanghai was to evacuate French troops and French overseas Chinese, and that the aforementioned action had clearly exceeded the scope of its mission. They immediately protested to the French Consul General and notified the French side that the warship must not leave Shanghai without authorization before receiving instructions from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the warship set sail at 9:50 a.m. yesterday morning without notifying our side, illegally carrying the arrested French Nazi criminal. The French Consul General visited Deputy Mayor He at the Municipal Government afterwards and said that he was willing to go to Wusong Port immediately to chase the warship back. However, the Beil Ding had already sailed out of Wusong Port and had not returned to Shanghai as of last night. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Dr. Lü Huaijun, Secretary of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai yesterday, (Office Director Ba Guolian went to Beijing), and only reported the following details of the case:</p>
<p>Content of Protest</p>
<p>Earlier, local newspapers published news related to the case in late last month. The Director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 28th regarding this matter. On New Year's Day this year, the office received a report from the local authorities stating that the French Consulate General in Shanghai had indeed deliberately sabotaged our country's measures to abolish consular jurisdiction and had independently arrested French Nazi citizen Kakopino stationed in Shanghai. It was also planned to escort the prisoner back to France on the French warship Beil Ding, which recently docked in Shanghai, on the 2nd of this month. Secretary Lü immediately sent a serious letter of protest to the French Consul General in Shanghai at 4 p.m. that day, the main content of which was: (1) Consular jurisdiction in China has long been abolished for all countries. (2) The French Consulate General in Shanghai shall immediately close the consular court. (3) If the report received is indeed true, then we cannot but seriously protest and request that the prisoner be handed over to our military police authorities as soon as possible and transferred to our judicial organs for handling in accordance with the law. (4) The French Consul General's move not only damages our national sovereignty, but also affects the inherent friendship between China and France, and the French Consul General shall bear full responsibility for the consequences.</p>
<p>French Consul's Response</p>
<p>The French Consul General, Fei Lihao, immediately gave an oral reply at that time and sent a written reply the next day (2nd), the main content of which was: (1) The French Consul General admitted that he had independently arrested French traitor Kakopino, who was colluding with Germany, in Shanghai on December 3rd of last year. On December 28th of last year, the Shanghai French Consular Court abandoned the case and transferred it to the Saigon Court for handling. On New Year's Day this year, the prisoner was escorted onto the French warship Beil Ding and planned to leave Shanghai within one or two days. (2) The French Consul General has not received notification from the French Ambassador to China regarding the closure of the consular court. (3) Before the Sino-French new treaty is signed and comes into effect, the French Consul General still has consular jurisdiction, but he is very willing for the Sino-French new treaty to be signed as soon as possible, and before it is signed, he is willing to guarantee to minimize the activities of the consular court as much as possible so as not to hinder the free proceedings of the Chinese judicial organs. (4) The French Consul General will submit the original text of our protest to his government.</p>
<p>Another Protest</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd, Secretary Lü heard that the French warship Beil Ding would escort the prisoner Kakopino away from Shanghai at 11 a.m. on the 3rd, and visited the French Consul General again at 5 p.m. that day to raise an oral protest, the main content of which was: (1) Our side does not recognize that the French Consul General has the right to arrest and deport the prisoner. (2) The mission of the French warship to Shanghai has been limited by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to troop and expatriate evacuations and does not include escorting prisoners. If the warship wants to escort prisoners for export, which exceeds the original mission, it should be approved by our authorities again. (3) According to international law, warships should not violate local laws in foreign ports, otherwise the country where they are located may take appropriate actions to sanction them. (4) If the French Consul General and the Captain of the warship, Lieutenant General Philippe, are determined to escort the prisoner away from Shanghai, they shall bear full responsibility for all consequences. The French Consul General replied orally at that time that he would do his best to visit the French warship that night and discuss the matter with the captain and convey our views to the captain. However, because the captain is not under the command of the Consul General, and there is not enough time to ask the French government for instructions, he cannot guarantee anything.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Notification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government also notified the French Consul General in writing on the same day (2nd) at 6 p.m., stating that if the French warship escorts the prisoner away from Shanghai, it is beyond the mission originally approved by our side and should be allowed to export after our side has re-approved it, otherwise the French Consul General and the captain of the warship shall bear full responsibility for all consequences. At 9:50 a.m. yesterday (3rd), the French warship set sail and left Shanghai. The French Consul General visited Deputy Mayor He at the Municipal Government in the morning and said that he was willing to go to Wusong Port immediately to chase the warship back, but there has been no further news. It is also heard that Mr. Lü is currently considering the necessary steps to be taken in continuation based on the written and oral protests made in recent days, and has telegraphed the details of the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our foreign affairs authorities are expected to make a decision soon to safeguard our country's legal dignity, national sovereignty and prestige.</p>
<h3>Deputy Commander of the Third War Area, Zheng Dongguo, Succeeds</h3>
<p>Zhang Xuezhong, Deputy Commander of the Third War Area and Director of the Shanghai Command Post, has recently been transferred to an important position. The vacancy was filled by Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo. Zhang and Zheng hosted a banquet for reporters last night, where Xiang Renzhi and others reported that the remaining nearly 750,000 Japanese expatriates and prisoners of war will be repatriated using American landing craft and 16 special ships, possibly all being completed within one or two months.</p>
<h3>Enemy Property Committee Decides to Return Three Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Because a portion of the factories to be returned in the third batch is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made, only three factories of domestic manufacturers were approved at yesterday's 28th Enemy and Puppet Property Review Meeting: Jiuhe Iron Factory, Detai Machinery, and Huachang Copper Refining Factory.</p>
<p>The sixth batch of flat-priced cloth from the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau will be sold soon. In addition, a large amount of cloth will be handed over to the China Textile Construction Corporation for free wholesale to the market. American cotton from the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will arrive in Shanghai soon, so the price of cotton yarn and cloth will fall further. The enemy and puppet yarn factories in this city will be taken over entirely by the China Textile Corporation.</p>
<h3>Traitor Jiang Yougen to be Tried Again Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The case of traitor Jiang Yougen, who recruited workers for the enemy on the left, will be reopened in the High Court of the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao today. According to reports, Jiang and others recruited Chinese workers in Shanghai in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) to go to the Philippines to work for the enemy. Many workers are still missing.</p>
<h3>Divide Areas; Implement Public Prostitution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the establishment of rural community societies and massage parlors in this city, which are not only detrimental to public morals, but also unhygienic, has closed them down with the approval of the Municipal Government since the 1st. The municipal authorities have decided to permanently ban such businesses and it is heard that they will divide fixed areas to implement a public prostitution system. Licenses will be issued after the regulations are stipulated and passed. The Social Affairs Bureau is drafting a plan to provide relief to unemployed prostitutes.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Extort Gold Bars: Owner of National Medicine Store Suddenly Kidnapped; Rescued Hostage Within Fifteen Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Rongchuntang National Medicine Store, located at No. 117, Lane B, Rue du Pere Robert, experienced a kidnapping and extortion case around 6:45 PM the night before last. The kidnapped individual was Lan Baorong, a Cantonese native. Fortunately, the police authorities solved the case swiftly, and the hostage was safely rescued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Kidnapping by Car</p>
<p>Lan Baorong (alias Huiru), 51 years old, is a wealthy Cantonese native who has operated Rongchuntang National Medicine Store for many years. This made him a target for gangsters. Around 6:45 PM the night before last, five gangsters suddenly arrived, all armed with guns. They rushed upstairs, falsely claiming to be personnel from a certain military organization. Without asking for any explanation, they kidnapped him, pushed him into a car, and drove away.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>After the incident, his son, Jineng, reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station. Chief Zhao immediately dispatched Inspector Qin Boliang and other officers to investigate and observe the direction in which the car had left. Around 7:20 PM, the hostage suddenly sent a two-word note home, instructing his family not to seek help from random people. Another note was addressed to his accountant, requesting Mr. Li to come to his location with the person who delivered the note.</p>
<p>Demand for Five Gold Bars</p>
<p>At that time, Lan's cousin, Sihong, and the accountant, Yang Zumin, accompanied the gangster Li to visit him. Meanwhile, they secretly reported to the branch office, which dispatched several plainclothes police officers to follow them. They reached the vicinity of Longhua, but due to the extreme darkness, the police officers mistakenly took a wrong turn, resulting in wasted effort. After Sihong and others arrived at the gangster's den, the gang leader demanded five gold bars for his release. However, the men only had 100,000 legal tender, three gold rings, and one gold watch with them, which was far from the requested amount. Negotiations did not progress at all.</p>
<p>Contacting at a Tobacco Shop</p>
<p>Finally, it was decided that the remaining amount would be dealt with at 9 AM the next morning at the Coco Cafe. Unexpectedly, the meeting place was changed to the Guangming Tobacco Shop at No. 731, Mingguo Road, Southern City (which is owned by Sihong). Thereupon, Deputy Chief Zhao Li and Gold Section Chief Jiang Zhaolong, officers Li Zihua, Chen Xiansheng, Ma Shaosong, Weng Hongxun, Ma Bingning, Inspector Qin Zhenliang, Xue Qijie, and others disguised themselves as hawkers and rickshaw pullers, secretly surrounding the area. Around 10 AM, a man in a Western suit slowly approached.</p>
<p>Suddenly Arrested</p>
<p>Chief Zhao recognized him, and Inspector Qin grabbed him, seizing a pistol with five bullets. He was taken to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, he was Chen Mei, alias Xiguang, 26 years old, from Fengtian, residing at No. 3, Jinde Lane, Menghua Street, Ximen. He confessed to the kidnapping and stated that the hostage was hidden on the second floor of the Dangchunlou Restaurant on Route A.</p>
<p>Hostage Rescued</p>
<p>Many officers were immediately dispatched to the above location to rescue the hostage, who was safely brought to safety. A guard, named Ye Bao, 41 years old, from Chuzhou, Zhejiang, was also captured. The case occurred the night before last and was solved by 11 AM yesterday, a total of fifteen hours. The branch office plans to report the case to the General Bureau and recommend rewards for the officers involved.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>In your newspaper's second day publication, the review of the heroic Songhu resistance, yesterday's award of the honorary banner column, the 87th Division was mistaken for the 77th Division. Please correct it. Huang Wenhui, Political Department Director of the 88th Division of the Army.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>Weather Forecast: Over the Yellow Sea, cloudy or clear, relatively cold, strong northeast winds, clouds around Shandong. Over this area, overcast or cloudy, relatively cold, crisp northwest winds, localized clouds in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

<h3>US Lends Us $300,000 for Shipbuilding Fund</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Ministry of Transportation originally established a shipbuilding office, planning to build 30 shallow-draft flat-bottomed boats suitable for navigation on the Sichuan River before the victory. Construction began in November of last year and was expected to be completed by mid-February of this year. It is now learned that the shipbuilding office will soon be closed, and all eight factories in Chongqing will focus on repairing vehicles and ships. Shipbuilding matters will be transferred to the Resources Committee. It is reported that the United States will lend us $300,000 as a fund.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Store Robbed: Loss of One Hundred Gold Rings</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Laowannian Jewelry Store at No. 20 Rue de la Sainte Famille was suddenly visited by five gangsters around 1 PM yesterday. Three of them were carrying guns. One of them pretended to want to exchange a gold ring with the character "Wei" on it. Just as he was taking off the ring, another gangster pulled out a pistol and drove all the staff into the back room. They then looted one hundred and one gold rings from the wall cabinet drawers and fled.</p>
<h3>Implementing Segmented Fare Calculation: Tram Fares Increase Today; Routes 24 and 18 to be Restored</h3>
<p>In order to improve transportation, take into account the convenience of citizens, and maintain the company's business, the Public Utilities Bureau has drafted a comprehensive improvement plan for the city's tramways. It also convened British and French companies to discuss the implementation steps. For routes 24 and 18, which are not yet directly connected, it was decided to find ways to restore them within January 1946. At the same time, using existing materials, the tracks of the two companies will be connected as soon as possible from Hongkou Park to Avenue Joffre and from Rue de Tsi-an-Tse to Route Ghisi, so that north-south vehicles can directly reach the destination. The fare structure has also been thoroughly discussed. Due to the different lengths of the routes, the previously implemented unified fare was not entirely suitable for Shanghai's actual situation. Therefore, to take into account the reasonable burden on general passengers, it is permitted to calculate fares based on distance, so as to be fair. It is now learned that tram first-class and trolleybus fares will start from 30 yuan, third-class fares will start from 20 yuan, and buses will start from 40 yuan, all increasing proportionally with distance, effective from the 4th of this month.</p>

<h3>Why are China Stocks So Popular on the Market? Retail Investors are Most Afraid of Being Trapped</h3>
<p>The new exchange rate is eagerly awaited, but has not yet been announced. The speculative market has gradually become numb from being keenly sensitive. Initially, bare money was abandoned by hot money, and US dollars were active for a few days, but gradually returned to normalcy. China stocks have taken their place, and popular stocks have all recovered to their peak. Some have even risen twice as high as the pseudo-currency standard. Many less popular stocks have also benefited from this trend. Some stocks are still below their face value in legal tender. Compared to Xinguang Underwear, which suffered fire losses, with China Underwear or Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory; Qinheng Shirts and Socks with China-France Pharmacy or Jinglun Shirts and Socks; Yong'an Textile Factory with China Textile Xinnuo, true investors must abandon the former and choose the latter. This abnormal phenomenon will probably only be corrected when the market officially recovers. Why does hot money always flock to popular stocks? The only answer is that it is easy to flip for a quick profit. Retail investors are most afraid of being trapped. According to reports, the assets of recently capitalized stocks are worth several times their legal tender equity. However, after the equity is converted from pseudo-currency to legal tender, most shareholders will always have to contribute some more money. Prices have risen many times over. The arrival of prosperity is in sight, the factory's assets are undamaged, and shareholders do not get any benefits other than converting the face value of pseudo-currency to legal tender. They have to pay out of their pockets again, although it is for a good cause, but they are not entirely satisfied. No one wants to buy if they want to sell, and they are afraid of the pain of paying. At this transition period, the people in charge of stocks that have been demoted to the cold palace should no longer think about their own pockets. The dark period has passed, and one can only fish in muddy waters once. Do not neglect shareholders' rights and ruin your reputation. In fact, given such favorable assets, why not sell some of the inventory so that shareholders can get some practical benefits? I hope that all manufacturers will reflect on this, so that the China stock market can move from speculation to investment and the national capital can be widely developed.</p>
<h3>Wool Still Difficult to Recover</h3>
<p>The wool market is still difficult to recover. It does not make progress due to the embellishment of foreign aid. Bulk prices continue to hover at low levels, and actual transactions are still limited. When general merchants occasionally encounter customer needs, they try their best to select the best goods. The retail prices of general stores are much higher than the wholesale prices. The current wholesale prices have fallen to 50% to 60% of their peak, while retail prices have only fallen to 90% to 80%.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Dyes Show Strength</h3>
<p>During the New Year holiday, foreign merchants are still purchasing colored cloth and rushing to transport it back. It is said that the sales of colored cloth to foreign merchants will only last for a dozen days before the Lunar New Year. Therefore, people in the industry are rushing to purchase during this holiday. Sales to Sichuan and Hubei are particularly good. However, weaving factories cannot produce in large quantities due to uncleared warehouse orders from the previous year and rising dark market prices for yarn. There is also not much gray fabric coming from Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places. Therefore, the cloth market is quite strong. Yesterday, medium-grade 12-pound fine cloth was quoted at 26,000 yuan. Dyes are being purchased by dyeing factories, and several popular items, such as vulcanized tide blue and vulcanized alkali, have improved market sentiment at yesterday's tea party. Among them, LR tide blue was quoted at over 900,000 yuan. It is reported that several dyeing factories have recently resumed work and need to purchase some dyes to replenish their inventory. Moreover, there are not many days left until the Lunar New Year, and people in the industry think they should hurry up if they want to do business, so the market has finally risen. The German dye giant, Defu Foreign Firm, has been closed for a long time. Since the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau sent personnel to clear it, manufacturers have been applying to purchase it, but the procedures are cumbersome and may not be able to enter the market in time.</p>
<h3>Southern Merchants Purchasing Flour, Soybean Cake Sales Still Strong</h3>
<p>The rice market is closed for the New Year holiday and will reopen today. However, the miscellaneous grains market is still open. Southern merchants are purchasing flour, especially those from Fuzhou. The local market is affected by subsidized flour, and the market situation is not very good, but there is still a sign of price increases. Due to the arrival of 2,000-3,000 loads of Shandong peanut oil at Liuhekou, oil prices are weak and have fallen by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil has also followed suit with a decrease of several hundred yuan. Soybean cake sales to Shantou and Taiwan continue and have become active again, with prices rising by 100 yuan. The arrival and sales of soybeans are both slow, and prices have not changed. Corn is stable. Raw peanuts and sesame seeds are scarce and prices are firm. Store purchases from all over Siyi are quite strong. Domestic sources are gradually becoming scarce, and prices have continued to rise by 1,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>How to Dispose of Remaining Looted Yarn [Continued]</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>At that time, the enemy and puppets oppressed our people, often giving small sweets and small amounts of money after extortion, calling it buying when it was clearly a forced confiscation, and forcing them to sign documents when they were clearly coerced, calling it an application for sale. They also said that the purchase was at a price, with gold included, but the price they gave was so low that even the entire price only amounted to a quarter of the market price at the time. If the gold was converted to the market price at the time, the total price would still not reach half of the original price. Moreover, the gold had to be received in two installments, with a gap of six months between them. The pseudo-currency in the price has not been eliminated to this day. The actual price was much lower than half of the original price.</p>
<p>Even taking a step back, in terms of the apparent direct loss at the time, the coarsest and lowest-grade 20-count cotton yarn was priced at approximately 40,000 yuan per piece in early August 1943. The purchase price set by the enemy and puppets was 10,000 yuan per piece, half of which was paid in gold, totaling 1 tael and 2 qian and 5 fen. At a market price of 8,000 yuan per tael, this amounted to 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the total of banknotes and gold was 15,000 yuan per piece, with a net loss of 25,000 yuan per piece. The calculation can be shown as follows:</p>
<p>Market price of one piece of cotton yarn 40,000 yuan - (Half of the price paid 5,000 yuan + (Half of the price paid Gold 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen x Market price 8,000 yuan) = Loss 25,000 yuan</p>
<p>At that time, the total loss of forced purchases of yarn, such as 40 bolts of cloth also counted as one piece, can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(Total number of purchases 263,206 pieces - Number of retained pieces 29,849 pieces - Number of exempted pieces 26,712 pieces) x Loss per piece 25,000 yuan = Total loss 5,166,125,000 yuan</p>
<p>In terms of direct losses at the time, the purchase price only amounted to 37.5% of the market price. It was no different from the free seizure of 129,154 pieces of yarn. Moreover, half of the price in banknotes was paid in six installments. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the term has not yet expired, and the intangible loss due to the depreciation of the currency is even more difficult to calculate. All of this was accumulated by the sweat and blood of legitimate merchants, and was forcibly damaged by the enemy and puppets through illegal means.</p>
<p>However, due to the lack of transportation, the enemy and puppets did not remove all of the yarn that they had forcibly purchased. According to reports, the following quantities were kept by the puppet merchants' association and transferred to the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau:</p>
<p>Cotton yarn: 13,226 pieces</p>
<p>Gray fabric: 146,912 bolts</p>
<p>Finished fabric: 2,216,639 bolts</p>
<p>This is the only remaining vitality of the industry. Although it is temporarily taken over by the government, it should be distinguished from enemy and puppet property. The Allied Joint Declaration of Cairo on January 5, 1943, stated:</p>
<p>"Retains the right to declare invalid any transfer or transaction by enemy governments, directly or indirectly, of property or rights belonging to persons (including legal persons) residing in the said areas. This declaration applies to such transfers or transactions, whether they are carried out through open looting and seizure, or through a form that appears to be legal, or even close to a voluntary sale by the parties concerned."</p>
<p>The principles for the disposal of enemy and puppet industries in the recovered areas formulated by the National Government state:</p>
<p>"For factories sold to the enemy during the war, if the owner can provide concrete evidence proving that the sale price was less than 50% of the market price of the factory buildings and machinery at the time, this can be considered strong evidence of forced sale."</p>
<p>Then, the remaining part of the enemy and puppet's forced purchase of yarn, according to the initial so-called purchase, is a synonym for forced seizure, and the application for sale was signed under strong pressure, and the price paid was far less than half of the market price at the time. All of this is sufficient evidence for the industry to demand its return, not to mention that less than half of it has not been issued?</p>
<p>Or it may be said that the industry did not formally present a joint petition to the government at the time, declaring the forced circumstances, and that going to the enemy and puppet organization to receive the money was a procedural failure and ignorance of near-term interests, which is also not an accurate argument. In terms of reporting, it was widely shocking at the time, and the government in the rear already understood it clearly. It is not necessary to rely on a joint petition to prove that it was forced. As for receiving money and dismissing employees, where else could they get it? The industry in this city has been exhausted, and credit is not guaranteed. Who would be willing to save people from a well, and who would have the power to engage in this great and universal rescue? If we try to think from their perspective, we should not have any blame.

<h3>The Departure and Return of Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>For the past ten-odd years, I have immersed myself in the study of Chinese novels and operas, never emerging from that pile. To be honest, I have rarely read literary creations; with one exception, I have seen many plays, all on stage, and also seen some play scripts, which friends brought for me, an amateur, to critique. It's really hard to say anything, as I am quite out of touch. But after all, I made my name with the study of new literature and art, so I can't completely forget about new literature and art. At the very least, I still look at the titles and authors of various works with a sense of attachment, because many of the authors are my friends. I have always respected the work of my friends.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, I was in Shanghai, completely cut off from the literary and artistic circles in the rear. On February 12th of last year, I set off for Lihuang, Anhui University, to teach. I thought that once I reached the free area, I would be able to find out some news about my old friends, but it turned out to be not much better than in Shanghai, which was occupied by the enemy. The little news I could get mostly came from the "Cultural News" published in Chongqing. I don't know if I was too lazy or too busy, but I never took the initiative to write letters to inquire about my friends. Although after I arrived in Lihuang, the Central News Agency sent out a news item, which was published in newspapers everywhere, the address was not detailed, so even if my friends wanted to write to me, they had no way to do so. Besides, my friends and I didn't have anything urgent to say, or something that had to be communicated by letter, so maybe everyone was just too lazy? Xie Liuyi once wrote me a letter, but since the Pinghan Railway was broken through by the Japanese army and the rear was cut off, it became even more difficult for friends to communicate. Only Zhu Wen and Luo Hong, a couple in Tunxi, southern Anhui (Luo Hong recently published a collection of novels called "This Era" with Zhengyan Publishing House), and Shi Diancun in Changting, Fujian, still write to me often. The publications sent to me include two issues of the "New Literature" monthly magazine from Guilin, Guangxi, and the Youth Daily and Zhengqi Daily from Gan County, Jiangxi. The latter publishes a "Literary and Art Special Issue" once every half month. I remember that Sun Yong's introduction to the literature of small and weak ethnic groups was the most noteworthy, mostly translated from Esperanto. (He also recently published a "Bulgarian Novel Collection" with Zhengyan Publishing House.) In addition, the "Southeast Literature and Art" supplement of the Southeast Daily in Zhejiang, edited by Xie Yue, has been sent to me from the first issue, more than ten issues in total, including articles by Wang Xiyan, Lin Zhujing, and others. I know more about the news of the Southeast literary and art circles, such as articles by Shi Zhicun, Cao Juren, and Xu Qinwen, which are often seen. The "United Weekly" in Fujian also made me aware of a lot of news. From it, I also saw articles by Zhong Jingwen and Wu Daxian. Once, Ma Yimin returned from Chongqing by plane, bringing "Wen Shao" and "Anti-Japanese War Literature and Art," and only then did I see articles by Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Lao She, and other brothers. My friends sending me letters and publications made me feel the warmth of friendship. From the above description, I deeply feel that the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War have scattered the friends in the literary and artistic circles, some in the east and some in the west, unable to gather together. Guilin and Chongqing are naturally two centers. After the fall of Guilin, only Chongqing became the center. Although other places, such as southern Anhui, northern Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang, are only tributaries, they each have their own expressions. Due to the impact of the war and the obstruction of transportation, various places can be said to be out of touch with each other, and literary and artistic works cannot be exchanged for reading. I heard that Zhang Jinglu is preparing to use wooden boats to transport all the literary and artistic books in Chongqing to Shanghai for cheap sales, which is a very good piece of news. I hope that at least someone will write some words to summarize the situation of the literary and artistic circles in various places over the past eight years; it would be best if someone would be willing to compile a set of "Anthology of Literary and Artistic Works from the Eight Years of the Anti-Japanese War," like the Liangyou "Grand Series of New Chinese Literature," so that people like us who live on deserted islands can also learn more about the literary activities in the great rear.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I finally returned to Shanghai. Brother L莽莽, who runs the "Cultural News," and I met again. He told me that the Cultural News would be published in Shanghai and would improve its style. Zhu Wen, Luo Hong, and Cao Juren have also returned, and many friends have returned to Shanghai. I have participated in many literary and artistic gatherings and tea parties. Shanghai will gradually become the center of the literary and artistic circles again. I am very happy that old friends I haven't seen for many years can reunite. However, when I think about the actual publishing situation, I am not so happy. Other countries are already at peace, but our China is still in a civil war, transportation cannot be quickly restored, newspapers are still so expensive, and the cost of living is still so high. Apart from the Commercial Press, Cultural Life Publishing House, Times Publishing House, Wanye Bookstore, and others publishing a few literary and artistic books each, there are very few literary and artistic books to be seen. Moreover, it is almost impossible for me to answer which one is an epoch-making masterpiece, or what major works were produced during the Anti-Japanese War. Perhaps some new writers have experienced the battlefield and written lengthy masterpieces that have not yet been published, or cannot find an opportunity to publish them, but we have not yet discovered them. Could it be that China has no "Under Fire" by Barbusse, "Men in War" by Dorgelès, or "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" by Ibáñez? I eagerly hope for the appearance of great works of war literature.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in Lihuang, I was very happy to see a list of literary and artistic books by chance. There were too many books, and I had no way or time to look at them in detail. At that time, I wanted to buy two anthologies, one was Chang Renxia's "Selected Modern Chinese Poems" sold by Dushu Shenghuo Publishing House, and the other was Xu Xiacun's "Five Years of Novels" published by Chongqing Jianguo Bookstore. But it is said that Mr. Chang's poetry selection is biased towards the friends he knows, and the scope is not very broad. Therefore, I more urgently hope that the publication of the "Anthology of Literary and Artistic Works from the Eight Years of the Anti-Japanese War" can become a reality.</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Literary and Art Association has held its founding meeting, and literary and artistic publications such as "Literary and Artistic Renaissance," "Literary Circles," "Literary Federation," and "Articles" are all about to be launched in the new year. "Literary and Artistic Annals" and "Wheat Seed" will also continue to be published. The Shanghai literary scene, like "Sleeping Beauty," has been asleep for many years and is now waking up again. To sum up what I said last time, my hopes for the literary and artistic circles in the new year are: 1. Compile an "Anthology of Anti-Japanese War Literature and Art"; 2. The emergence of great works of war literature; 3. The Shanghai Branch of the Literary and Art Association can achieve some work results.</p>

<h3>Literary and Military Figures Despise Each Other</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>The world has made many criticisms about "literary figures despising each other," but in fact, "literary and military figures despising each other" is also worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Human nature is inherently fond of peace. Therefore, in the "democratic century," it seems that it should be said to be the era of the "pen" rising to the top. However, why are countries around the world still manufacturing "guns"? And friends who wield the "pen" are still often at a disadvantage—especially in China?</p>
<p>Most people think this way. So, which weighs more, the "pen" or the "gun"? It's really getting more and more confusing. "Literary" figures can despise "military" figures, and "military" figures can despise "literary" figures. They seem to have their own reasons, and that's why.</p>
<p>Many people think this way: in times of turmoil, military strength should be emphasized and literary pursuits should be downplayed; in times of peace, literary pursuits should be emphasized and military strength should be downplayed. This is inheriting the influence left over from ancient times, and it is no longer applicable in modern times. You say that modern "military" people, if they don't understand politics, can they still succeed? So "military" cannot be separated from "literary." But can "literary" be separated from "military"? I ask, how many times has a political revolution relied solely on the "pen"?</p>
<p>However, this kind of measurement of "literary" and "military" is just talk that rolls around on the surface. To get to the heart of the matter, you only need to ask one question: who invented and manufactured the "gun"? Was it a "literary" person or a "military" person? If the atomic bomb is the most meritorious "weapon" in this victory, then the scientists who wield the "pen" are the most meritorious "literary" people. The sad thing is: perhaps those meritorious "literary" people will also die at the hands of "military" people who use atomic bombs, and so it is that "military" people despise each other.</p>
<h3>Flying Together, Sharing a Nest</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>I often think: in my writing, I have never written a comedy. It's not that I deliberately do this, maybe I simply don't have the talent to write comedies; but sometimes I am limited by the material, and I cannot force a tragic subject matter into a comedy. Of course, there are times when the material comes from my own fabrication, and I may plan to develop it into a tragedy from the beginning! I don't have any absolute reason to do this. In my subconscious, I always feel that: life is a natural tragedy. From birth to old age and death, a person is subjected to various oppressions: human, social; spiritual, material; no matter how privileged your environment is, you will inevitably suffer from partial troubles! Furthermore, there are almost no events in this world that can constitute a comedy. If you don't believe me, think about it calmly, what is worth being happy about? What is truly complete and perfect? What has not been infiltrated by human tears? Making you cry! What is without defects and ugliness? Making you disappointed! I myself grew up in this tragic atmosphere, so I look at everything with a tragic eye, and maybe I simply don't have the mood to write comedies. At the same time, I think: based on my above understanding, life is a tragic life; the world is a tragic world; then, who doesn't want to see a portrayal of their own life; who doesn't want to see the true form of this world in which they exist! Some people say: this is my unhealthy expression. But I deny it! I think: it's not that I'm unhealthy, but that the reality in all aspects is unhealthy. I am not good at writing embellished words in my life, just as I am not used to telling lies as a person. The most precious thing in the universe is truthfulness and simplicity; therefore, why must we cover up "truth" and expose hypocrisy? When we are sad, we cry when we want to cry, why bother forcing a smile? When something is broken; or when something fails; we admit it frankly, why bother insisting on emphasizing that it is "beauty of imperfection"? But then again, I also very much hope to write comedies, and I even try to create comedies. I haven't tried "writing" comedies yet, but I have had two experiences of "creating" comedies. But I am ashamed to say that the comedies I created have all failed! It seems that God has destined me to be a tragic author!</p>
<p>I don't care about the failure of writing comedies, because that is just personal damage. But I am pained by the failure of creating comedies, because that is the damage of many people! The first failure to create a comedy was a failure on one of my best friends; fortunately, it was only a partial failure. The second failure was on the male and female protagonists of this novel, and this was a complete failure. But this "failure" was not due to my deliberate "rascality" that led to the failure. To put it superstitiously, it was simply "divine misfortune," letting me fail! Failure to the point that human power could not save it, failure to the point that people would not believe it was a fact! Although I am not responsible for this failure, my heart is very guilty!</p>
<p>I remember when the comedy I created opened—that is, on the day when the male and female protagonists in the novel held their wedding ceremony, I said a few words as the introducer. I said: "I have always written scripts, but today I want to be a director for once. I am very satisfied with my two protagonists, and I hope that the play I direct will be a complete success, with each act more exciting and more effective than the last..." My words won a lot of applause from the audience at the time. At the same time, I sent them a couplet, and I used a few idioms to write it. The first line was: "The wife sings and the husband follows, a perfect match," and the second line was: "Flying together, sharing a nest, flowers are good and the moon is full." This couplet was later criticized for having problems. That friend told me: "The problem" lies in the four words "flying together, sharing a nest." I asked him what it meant? He resolutely refused to say, and I pressed him tightly before he said half-jokingly and half-seriously: "Anyway, it's unlucky, but fortunately, children's words are unbridled, it doesn't matter!" I didn't think much of this when I heard it, and I regarded it as nonsense in jest. Since ancient times, who doesn't know that "flying together, sharing a nest" is an auspicious word, but this nagging friend made such a distortion, so I immediately wanted to scold him for being absurd, but later it turned out that it wasn't him who distorted it, but me who "distorted" it; it wasn't him who was absurd, but me who was "absurd"; "flying together, sharing a nest" was indeed not the implication of comedy, but the implication of tragedy; he not only overturned my prejudice, but also overturned the prejudice of history! From this, I understood that his "unlucky" interpretation was indeed reasonable, so I used this unlucky idiom as the title of my novel. First, I wanted to correct my absurdity and the absurdity of history, and I warned everyone not to take these four words as auspicious words in the future. Second, I want to commemorate the occurrence of this tragic incident that is so true that it is bizarre. Perhaps at first glance, some people will think that I am writing a comedy. Or even some people will misunderstand that I am taking this vulgar title out of boredom for business purposes, in order to cater to low tastes. In fact, none of this is true. Strictly speaking, this tragedy was not deliberately created by me, nor was it really brought about by the four words "flying together, sharing a nest." So, whose sin is it? It is the dark forces that remain in the old society that have lost ethics and humanity! It is the war launched by this international bandit! Under this terrible force, in this cruel war; there are really too many tragic stories like this! This is just the narration of one incident, and in this one story, only a few people were sacrificed! There are countless other people who have been sacrificed, and their wronged souls will forever file complaints against the "dark forces" that remain in the old society and the "war" launched by this bandit! Yes, I am one of the writers entrusted to write the petition! Now, I am willing to describe this story in a simple and unadorned way, that is, to write a petition to the times accusing the dark forces and the war for the wronged souls in this story and all the wronged souls who have been sacrificed! At the same time, I am asking the times on their behalf for two concrete conditions for compensation for losses, namely: the birth of a new society and the coming of true peace! If these two conditions cannot be fulfilled, I think that those wronged souls who have lost the lawsuit will definitely not rest in peace even in death!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to declare that although the story described in this novel is true, in order to "novelize" it, I have to interweave and cut down on the plot. I hope that readers will not be criticized by third parties related to this story!</p>
<p>As I write, the rooster crows at dawn! A ray of dawn shines through the window, so I tear off the first page of the thirty-fifth year's calendar, stop writing, step out of the corridor, stretch my waist, take a deep breath of fresh air, and then kneel to the sky with full enthusiasm; reverently, for those innocent wronged souls, and for us, a group of people living in distress, we welcome the "birth of a new society" and the "coming of true peace" brought by the new year!</p>
<h3>Sunlight</h3>
<p>— Deng Lin</p>
<p>I stopped in front of a bald French parasol tree.</p>
<p>The child stood alone, his dark, glossy eyes glanced at me.</p>
<p>"Accurate?" I was a little surprised by his ability, in this bleak west wind.</p>
<p>"Cold?" He was equally surprised by my question. But he immediately said affirmatively, "No!"</p>
<p>Children should be the most innocent, if the surroundings do not give him an enticement.</p>
<p>"Why?" I began to approach his body. Holding his richly woven, small, tender hand, I found that it had been frozen bright red. Suddenly, sorrow surged into my soul...</p>
<p>No wonder the world is so turbid, even children have learned to deceive.</p>
<p>"Look at the sunlight!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" I laughed at my foolishness.</p>
<p>No matter how desolate the world is, the most unfortunate fate must befall the group who have lost the sunlight.</p>
<h3>In Praise of Yingpeng's Painting</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>All undertakings are nothing more than the expression of personality, especially articles, calligraphy, and painting, which are most clearly expressed. Once articles, calligraphy, and painting fall into hypocrisy, they are like paper-扎 flowers, no matter how good they look, they have no life.</p>
<p>It is natural for articles, calligraphy, and painting to express personality, but how to express them more truly and vividly requires a period of cultivation. The more deeply cultivated, the more truly moving and clearly thorough the expression.</p>
<p>Like Chinese landscape painting, most people think that it is difficult to express personality, because the object is only lifeless wood and stone. In fact, landscape painting is the most able to express a person's personality. It is necessary to know that those who can exhaust the mountains and rivers already have a good character, and if they paint well, their personality is naturally higher. Because to paint landscapes, one must first have the mind of landscapes, high and broad, and without a trace of vulgar thoughts, can one paint the true colors of nature. If a person's personality is not good, he will not think of the mystery of the mountains and rivers, he will not see the greatness of the mountains and rivers, and he will not feel the spirit of the mountains and rivers, so although there are many craftsmen who reluctantly pretend to be connoisseurs, the landscapes they paint are still full of craftsmanship, and there is absolutely no elegance of landscapes.</p>
<p>Chinese landscape painting is really difficult to paint. You want to paint lifeless stones so that they are spiritual, how difficult is that! And when we appreciate real landscapes, we feel that the landscapes are really spiritual. I originally couldn't understand landscape painting. Later, after several years of training in watching landscape paintings, I actually understood it, and the more I watched landscape paintings, the more interesting I found them. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I had no leisure to watch paintings, and there were no good landscape paintings to provide me with observation. Recently, with the arrival of victory, I read many landscape paintings by Zhu Yingpeng, which really made me slap the table and exclaim, sweeping away the depression of not seeing landscapes for eight years. Yingpeng's paintings, although small in size, have the momentum of thousands of miles between the inches. They are all creations, and none of them have blueprints, but each has a chapter, and the best of them can simply capture the essence of the mountains and rivers, as if they have vividly depicted the life of the mountains and rivers. The exquisiteness of Yingpeng's landscapes shows his noble personality. Yingpeng is the most distinguished person in the wealthy and turbid Shanghai. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he not only never lowered his head to the enemy and puppets, but on the contrary, he often used his most sharp pen to throw countless articles like bombs at the enemy and puppets. But after the victory, he is still like a pool of autumn water, calm and clear. With this attitude and this personality, he can write such beautiful and delicate landscapes. Not only are the landscapes well painted, but Yingpeng's figures, flowers, and birds are also different from the general. The figures are based on anatomy, and the flowers and birds are rooted in biology, and the beauty of his coloring is even more appreciated by all. Like a pot of flowers, the color of the flowers is simply like that drawn with Western chalk, which is admirable. In short, Yingpeng's paintings have personality, cultivation, and are indeed masterpieces.</p>

<h3>Vehicles Keep to the Right: Effective Warnings Need to Be Implemented Urgently</h3>
<p>— Jianlei</p>
<p>I read the suggestion of Mr. Gu, regarding the implementation of vehicles keeping to the right, to attach a piece of red cloth to the right hand of each driver as a warning. The author quite agrees with his statement. It is generally believed that the traffic in Shanghai is so complicated and the pedestrians are so chaotic that human life is at stake if one is not careful. If there is no "effective warning" beforehand, how can we prevent problems before they arise? Moreover, the habit of keeping to the left has been the norm since ancient times, and it is inevitable that old habits are hard to break once it is changed to keeping to the right. Especially for drivers, in the colorful streets, it is already difficult to deal with the coming and going from all directions. If there is no special "effective warning" to remind them at all times, they may accidentally go the wrong way, and human life and property will be damaged immediately. The proverb says that only by thinking of danger can we gain peace; and it also says that those who have long-term considerations will have no immediate worries. It is believed that our wise authorities will have proper arrangements, not just posting advertisements. As for the warning methods, in addition to Mr. Gu's suggestions, I will add a few more below: (1) Print "Keep Right Arrow Symbol" warning cards and hang them in front of the drivers. (2) Add red paint "Keep Right or Arrow Symbol" on the glass in front of the car. The same is true for the handles of other vehicles. (3) In the first two or three months, the speed of each vehicle must be specially limited. (4) All measures approved by the authorities should be announced and implemented immediately, otherwise driving will be prohibited.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Road Damage</h3>
<p>— Xu Zengyun</p>
<p>The roads of Shanghai were already considerably damaged during the enemy and puppet regime period, but now there are still people continuing to do the work of destruction. Who are they? They are generally ignorant children.</p>
<p>We only need to look at the asphalt and cement streets and alleys, and see one by one the cracked and sunken spots in the road surface – these are the traces of their destruction. Their unhealthy game – "kǎo líng ké" (possibly a game involving hammering something), using the sharp point of iron nails to repeatedly chisel the surface, and after one spot is damaged, they switch to another. At a time when construction funds are extraordinarily large and scarce, how can we tolerate the destruction of this bad habit? Moreover, it is of no benefit to themselves. The unsightly appearance of the city and the inconvenience of traveling are secondary. They do not realize that this is a very great harm to the public. Therefore, we should ask the authorities to pay attention and find ways to correct this at any time. Or have the police confiscate their toys when they see them. Please ask primary school teachers to prohibit this game, and sensible people should also advise them at any time. Then, I am afraid that soon our precious roads will be less damaged.</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
