<h3>主席頒令全國停戰　以示政府和平忍讓　自十一日午起正式施行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日下午八時電〕蔣主席八日對全國軍政長官頒發停止衝突命令，自十一日正午十二時起，全國軍隊一律停止戰鬥，各守原防，茲誌原令如下：限即到，陸軍總司令部顧總司令，海軍總司令部桂代總司令，空軍總司令部周總司令，聯合後勤總司令部黃總司令，各行轅主任，各綏靖公署主任，各戰區可令長官，首都衛戍司令官，各綏靖區司令官，各集團軍總司令，各警備司令，各省市政府主席，市長並轉各軍長均鑒：自去年敵軍投降以來，政府一貫方針，即在蘄求和平統一與民主建設，依政治途徑，解決國內糾紛，期於國民大會以前，奠定國家復興之基礎，雖因共軍首先對我國軍各處進攻，迫不得已，實行自衛，然對政治解決之旣定方針，始終一貫，是以不惜再四忍讓，遂有本年一月與六月間兩次停戰及國大召開之延期，茲爲昭示政府貫澈原定方針，特再頒佈停止衝突命令，望迅速轉令所屬，務於十一月一日正午十二時起，全國軍隊一律停止戰鬥，各守原防，以示政府和平忍讓之至意，仰恪切遵照，勿違爲要，中正戌齊（八日）手啓。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕和談在七日晚達沉悶最高潮，八日晨急轉直下，形勢立即開展。下午二時半，政府方面即下令停止軍事衝突，並於下午六時由中宣部長舉行記者招待會，公布主席對頒發停戰令之聲明。中外記者於下午六時即羣集於中央日報三樓，靜候彭氏蒞臨，並準備拍攝電影，室中充滿光明愉快氣氛。下午六時欠十分，彭携主席聲明之中英文稿至，旋即宣佈，一時室中機聲軋軋，光燈閃爍。極盡隆重之感。彭宣讀畢，本報記者詢以此種停戰之表示，是否爲永久的？彭稱：是，如無他人進攻，吾人決不反擊。招待會於下午七時十分散。</p>
<h3>主席將特發表聲明　重申如期召開國大保留各黨名額　望中共即出席三人會議</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日下午七時十分電〕中宣部八日下午六時五十分，舉行臨時之記者招待會，由彭部長學沛宣讀蔣主席之聲明，宣佈已明令關內外國軍，停止軍事行動，茲錄蔣主席聲明全文如下：</p>
<p>本年十月十六日，余會發表政府關於處理目前時局的聲明，並包括八項，作爲停止衝突協議之基礎的提議，原冀此項聲明，能得中共之答覆，以達全面停戰之目的，今當國民大會開會之前夕，余特重新聲明，政府一貫之政策，在促進國內和平，全國統一，以求達到結束訓政，開始憲政之目的，政府眞誠期望我全國能獲得永久之和平及政治之安定，爲實現此種期望，茲已明令關內外國軍，除爲防守現地所必需者外，停止其他軍事行動。</p>
<p>依照政治協商會議所決議，國民大會原應於本年五月五日召開，因中共與各黨派拒未提出其代表之名單，復於七月四日，政府宣布國民大會於十一月十二日召開，俾各黨派可於此四個月期間，作一切之商討與準備，對於此點，各黨派書表示異議，謂政協所同意改組政府之步驟，尙未實行，惟余欲有所說明者，自政協會議閉會以來，此半年間，一般情勢，已大有變遷，關外東北嚴重之戰事發生，旋又蔓延及於華北，而中共軍隊之整編，迄未依照協議之方案，而開始實行在此種狀况之下，政治協議遂未能獲得結果，現國民大會依法選出之代表，均已如期報到，國民大會實不能再予延期，以增加政治軍事之不安，而加深人民之痛苦，且召開國民大會，爲政府還政於民唯一合法的步驟，亦不能再有稽延，因此政府已決定國民大會於十一月十二日如期開會。</p>
<h3>國大開會後　司使決赴平</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京入日電〕司徒大使八日答記者問時稱，渠不信國大將予延期召開，復曰，一俟國大開幕，渠將實行業已三次展期之赴平計劃。</p>
<h3>商談停止衝突</h3>
<p>余在十月十六日之聲明，實已表示最大之忍讓，希望中共予以接受，以解決一切未決問題，政府對於山共期待其與各黨派同循民主之軌轍，而在軍事上必須使任何政黨，皆不能擁有軍隊，而任何軍隊均應爲國家之軍隊。</p>
<p>因此政府一而保留中共及其他黨派在國民大會應出席之代表名額，仍望其隨時參加制憲，一面希望中共立即派出代表參加軍事三人小組會議，根據余十月十六日聲明所提之各點，商談停止衝突辦法，與今後軍隊駐地分配，以及恢復交通與整編統編等辦法，以期從速施行。</p>
<h3>改組政府問題</h3>
<p>關於國府委員會之改組，望能早日獲得協議，俾得正式改組成立。至於行政院則爲實際負責之機構，其改組必須更加愼重，故國民大會米閉會以前，不能遽作此重大之變更。關於憲章政府擬向國民大會提出憲草審議會未完成之修正草案，此次國民大會閉會以後，六個月內，即依照憲法舉行全國普選，各黨派與全國人民屆時均可自由競選，以產生下屆國民大會根據憲法所規定而行使其法定之職權，故各黨派在下屆國民大會，對於憲法，如有修改意見，仍可依法提出修正。此數週內，實爲關係國家盛衰之重要關鍵，吾人如能竭盡努力，即不難樹立强盛繁榮民主的中國之基礎，吾人必須克服任何偏見，猜疑，仇恨之情緒，並應超脫一切困難，以貢獻於全民之利益，而今日全國人民最迫切之需要，實爲和平與安定，余深望本黨同志，各黨派人士，社會賢達，政府同人，全體官兵以及各有關方面之人士，務必精誠團結，通力合作，以和平之方式達成「政治民主化」「軍隊國家化」之目標。（完）</p>
<h3>中共方面之意見　認爲和談前途未容樂觀</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕共產黨代表國八日夜十一時，在梅園新村辦事處舉行中外記者招待會，就主席八日之聲明，發表如下之意見：國民黨政府單方面所宣布之「停止其他軍事行動」，事前旣未與共產黨代表協商，而「爲防守現地所必需」的除外，仍可作一切軍事行動的藉口。至政治方面所提之一切辦法，均與政協決哉及其程序相違背，因此談判前途，實未容樂觀。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城談話</h3>
<p>盼各方繼續努力和平</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕政府代表吳鐵城，於主席發表聲明後，對記者談稱：邵先生與本人上月赴滬，邀各黨派代表返京，盼能促進商談，早獲和平，各方面代表返京後，各方奔走，曾一度建議主席對八項方針作一讓步，政府已一再表示忍讓，而共產黨黨至今仍未同意，殊覺遺憾，茲以國大召開在即，政府已自動下停戰令，此種渴愛和平之苦心，實全國同胞所共鑒，尙希各黨派人士顧念大局，把握時機，繼續爲和平努力。</p>

<h3>外部發言人對記者談　中美商約眞精神　明白解釋最惠國之意義</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕中美商約四日簽訂並公佈後，各界會有種種不同批評。記者爲明瞭眞正訂約精神，及官對若干評議之解釋，特走訪外部發言人，談詢諾干要點，茲誌問答如後：</p>
<p>（問）對於本國國民之職業有無保障？（答）査第二條第二項規定締的彼方之國民，僅能從事於非專爲締約此方國民所保留之各種職業，並祇得由其以個人身分享受此種權利，締約一方如認爲某種職業應保留於其本國國民時，自可隨時以法律規定之。</p>
<p>（問）對於本國法人及團體有無保障？（答）査第三條第三款規定：締約彼方之法人及團體，在　約此方領土內，依法從事各項事業時，通常雖應與締的此方之法人及團體享受同樣待遇，　締約此方法律另有規定時，不在此限，故締約國之任何一方，仍得予其本國法人及團體以若干必要之特殊待遇，此與我國公司法第二百九十七條之規定完全相同。</p>
<p>（問）關稅自主是否受有影響？（答）査本約第十六條規定，彼方貨物進入此方時，其所繳納之關稅，不得高於任何第三國貨物所納之國稅，在此種規定下，我國如認爲有提高關稅以保護國內工業之必要時，除須給美方以最　國待遇，亦即平等待遇外，不受任何限制。至於入口貨物，不論其由外人或太國人輸入者，均須納同樣之人口稅，此不獨爲我國現行關稅辦法，亦爲並世各國之通例。</p>
<p>（問）商約中何以有關於移民之規定？（答）査美國國會於一九二三年通過法案，規定所有一切商約，必須明文規定，不得影響現行移民律及將來制定移民律之權，自一九二三年以來，美國對外商的均有上述保留條款，無一例外，故本約第二條第四款第一句，並非專對我國之規定，現時我國雖尙無移民律，惟將來認爲有必要時，我國有隨時制定此項法律之自由，且一九一七年二月五日美國限制特種地帶人民入境之法律，經木約訂明不適用於中國入民，此種訂明亦可爲中國人民應不受歧視之一種保陣。</p>
<p>（問）本約中最惠國條款之童義如何？（答）按照通例，任何條約所給予之待遇，非國民待遇，即最惠國待遇，捨此並無其他標準，而規定最　國待遇時，其意義有二：（甲）即表示不能給予國民待遇；（乙）俾與第三國處於同等地位而不致受差別待遇。今在條約中，雖有最惠國條款，如我對任何國家不給予特別優惠時，則此項條款不發生作用。至於本的中何者應給國民待遇，何者應給最　國待遇，本部曾會同有關機關詳加審議後，始行決定，並迭經與美方折衝而獲成議，且以國際間商務關係變化萬端，故本的之有效期間，僅規定五年，屆時再本實施效果，以爲應否修訂新約之根據。</p>
<h3>商討實施越南協定　中法會談昨開始　俟獲結果再在越討論技術問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕中法就實施關於越南協定會談，今晨舉行首次會議，會議日程經詳細商討後，業經具體決定，即將議續召開分組會議。今晨首决會議係在外交部舉行，出席法方首席代表莫氏（Maux）代表方丹葛司爾及秘書一人，我方首席代表爲外交部專門委員凌其翰，代表交通邵路政司薩福均，顧問凌士芬公路總局主任秘書蔡元，財政部關務署副署長朱偰均出席，參加，是次巾法會談，僅爲商討關於越南協定實施之技術問題，不涉及越南之政治問題，商討之範圍，共包含下列五項：（一）滇越鐵路滇段之估價；（二）滇越鐵路之修復及通車；（三）海防通過便利之辦法及特區之協定；（四）越北敵產之淸理（中法兩方將逕在越舉行）；（五）中國駐越軍費之淸算。其中前三項中法代表團正在南京進行商談，一俟獲致相當結果後，將在越繼續商談實施之技術問題，至滇越鐵路滇段產權，依照本年二月廿入日中法協定，由中國政府提前贖回，其代價田法政府負擔償付，作爲戰時我國假道海防及該路內運政府及人民物資損失之補償。又依照協定，中法組織淸査委員會淸理越北敵產，即將在越舉行。</p>

<h3>英商務訪華圖　在昆招待記者</h3>

<h3>國共商談經過</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室特輯</p>
<p>溯自政治協商會議成立以來，政府再三以寬大容忍的態度，求國是之早日解決，面無如其間節外生枝，遷延復遷延，以至於今。今政府熔受國大代表的決議，又令停止軍事行動，開誠布公，已爲天下人所共見。茲追述團共雙方商談經過如左：</p>
<p>會議的召集，係基於三十四年國優日政府與中共代表簽字的團結會談紀錄，共中規定　國民政府召開協商會議，邀請各黨派代表及社會賢達參加，討論國事及擬定和平建國方案。</p>
<p>三十五年一月六日，會議召開辦法法曁會員名單，經國民政府主席核定公佈。十日，政治協商會議在陪都國民政府禮堂開幕，至三十一日結束，經迭次開會及分組會議討論結果，成立：政府組織，國民大會，和平建國綱領，軍事問題，憲法草案等五項協議。會議進行期巾，政府與巾共當局，分別向所屬下令停止衝突，恢復交通，隨後，蔣主席復宣佈政府決即實施「保障人民之自由」，「承認政黨之合法地位」，「普選」，「釋放政治犯」等事項，全國人民，聞命之下，無不歡欣。</p>
<p>二月一十五日，由張治中·周恩來·馬歇爾組織的軍事三人小組會議，正式簽訂軍隊整編及統編中共部隊爲國車的基本方案，其中有兩項重要規定；（一）統帥權—國民政府主席爲中國陸海空軍最高統帥。（二）編組—全國陸軍縮編爲一〇八師，內共軍十八個師。此方案即作爲實施政治協商會議中關於軍事問題的基礎。但中共方面，不願實行統編，仍破壞交通，攻略城市。國軍開赴東北，接收領土主權，復多方阻撓，演成全面衝突。軍事談判，陷於停頓。經馬歇爾特使之努力奔走，沉寂甚久之國共政治商談，始於五月二十五日在首都邵力子先生私邸會談，政府代表爲邵力干，張厲生及王世杰，中共代表爲周恩來，董必武及陸定一。雙方就停戰問題　資傳休戰問題，恢復交通問題交換意見，但無具體決定。</p>
<p>政府爲促進和平起見，又於六月七日，頒令停止東北軍事行動十五日，但中共仍無誠意，至二十二日滿限，未有頭緒。政府委曲求全，再令延長至六月底爲止。</p>
<p>六月二十三日，軍事三人小親會議正式恢復，中共代表提出整軍對案，政府亦提出整軍新方案，馬歇爾特使在會議中竭力設法，折衷雙方意見，但仍不易接近。最後因馬使公斷權一問題，中共表示不能接受，會談終無結果。</p>
<p>七月三日，蔣主席接見中共代表周恩來，重申蔪來和平立塲，當夜由國共雙方代表開始直接談判，但以共方堅持先開政治協商會議，政府代表主張光作軍事談判，會談遂又陷於僵局，至八日止，未有結果而散。其後雖經馬特使與司徒大使努力斡旋，零星商談，若斷若續，亦無所成。</p>
<p>七月二十六日，周恩來與馬特使在京晤談，然後由蔣主席與馬特使書面交換意見，商談似有轉機，但因中共堅持所謂無條件停戰，以致和平談判，又生阻礙</p>
<p>此後雖經馬·司兩使奔走和平，迭次談判，均未能獲得解決。其癥結在於中共要求在共軍撤退後，撤退地方仍保持共然政府組織，此則有礙國家統一，馬使使命，又未成功。</p>
<p>八月十三日，蔣主席發表文告，昭告全國同胞，其中述及今後處理時局方針六項，表示對於政治協商會議所有決議，衷誠遵守；關於政治糾紛，仍採政治解決方法，但共黨軍隊應遵守軍隊國家化的協議，此層一有保證，政府隨時可與具體磋商所有未決問題。　迭次磋商，雙方同意先就改組政府，作爲談判入手。八月二十九日，馬使與周恩來會晤，議由國共雙方代表各二人，美方一人組成五人小組，交換改組政府意見。但中共代表在九月六日忽又提出所謂「停戰保證」的要求，橫生枝節，五人小組，無形　　。九月十三日，中共代表周恩來，突向馬使　議恢復三人軍事小組會議，認停戰爲和平之先決條件，以爲軍事小組，即可討論停戰問題，較之討論政治的五人會議更爲單純。然前此馬使數度京潯往返，本主政治商談與軍事商談，同時並進，至此遂成爲「三人」與「五人」之爭。九月十七日，周恩來至滬，一一十日向外籍記者發表談話，竟表示中共將退出政治談判，時局更趨惡化。蔣主席於九月廿七日返京，遂向馬司兩使表示同意於五人會與三人會同時召開，以示政府誠意希望和平。周恩來亦無異議，和平商談，似有轉機，而中共忽又强調賬家口之軍事衝突，向政府提出備忘錄，以致和平空氣，又佈一層陰影。　十月八日，馬使提出限期停戰之新建議，政府表示同意，同時希望周恩來返京參加商談，馬使來滬促行　。民盟靑年黨等代表亦竭力週旋，希望挽回大局。孫科留滬，遲遲未返南京，希望打開僵局。十七日，政協會議政府代表吳鐵城·邵力子·雷震先後來滬，邀集各黨各派人士晋京商談。並會同各黨各派調人敦勸中共代表一同赴京。周恩來方與各調人於廿一日同返，共商和平大計。</p>
<p>在政協會議政府代表來滬之前，政府曾說明談判之八項基點，中共方面復提出兩項要求，當周恩來一行抵京時，雙方尙未接近，但國大會期迫促，舉國渴望和平，政府寬大爲懷，表示即行改組國府委會，茲又頒發三次停戰命令，和談前途，在國大開會時，或可略見端緒矣。</p>

<h3>最後停戰令的頒發</h3>
<p>國民政府主席於昨日頒發停戰令，令國軍海陸空各部隊於本月十一日正午十二時起，一律停止戰鬥，各守原防，以示政府和平忍讓之至意。這爲各方所屬目的停戰令，終於頒發了。這個命令的頒發，無疑地，對於國內的局勢，必有良好的影響。在國府主席所頒發的停戰令中，我們看見有這樣的辭句：「自去年敵軍投降以來，政府一貫方針，即在蔪求和平統一與民主建設，依政治途徑，解决國內糾粉，期於國民大會以前，奠定國家復興之基礎，雖因共軍無端對我國軍各處進攻，迫不得已實行自衛，然對政治解決之旣定方針，始終一貫，是以不惜再四忍讓，遂有本年一月與六月間兩次停戰及國大召開之延期。茲爲昭示政府貫澈原定方針，特再頒布停戰命令」。的確，停戰命令的頒布，不自今日始，而此次停戰令的頒發，，其意義特別深長。</p>
<p>自日本投降以來，我政府以人民爲重，對於國內局勢所不惜蘄求者，原爲和平統一與民主建設；以是輿各黨各派及社會賢達，迭有商談，期於協商之中，能够成立協定，相互遵守，以臻國家於和平統一之境。其奈協議之墨瀋未乾，而新的攻勢重又展開，政府爲保障人民利益，同時爲自衛計，不得不以武力答復武力；所謂協議云云，徒成畫餅。然政府仍本一貫方針，忍讓爲國，遂有本年一月與六月間兩次的停戰以及國大的延期。然政府的一番苦心，卻不爲各方所共諒，以是停戰之令一下，共軍武力攻勢又復展開。到了最近，國軍收復了張家口以後，若干方面人士以爲這種局勢不能讓它持續下去，於是奔走斡旋，認爲政府如果能再頒發停戰命令，必於國內大局大有裨益。和平統一與民主建設旣爲我政府的一貫方針，停戰原爲政府朝夕所求者，故我主席於接受此項建議後，即發布文吿，聲明八點。此種立塲如得諒解，政府當即頒令停戰。兼旬以來，政府與各方所進行會談者，亦即在此。現在政府的停戰命令旣已頒發，則國內局勢的好轉，自必可期。我們願此次停戰令的頒發爲最後一次的停戰命令，此後國內的局勢，可以不再訴諸武力。</p>
<p>這一停戰命令的頒發，無疑地，對於當前的局勢，必將大有裨益。國大的召開前此旣曾延期，現在自决不能再有延展。從國大的性　言，國民太會所代表的爲國民而華政政黨。這是國民代表大會，而不是政黨代表大會，從理論上說，國民大會的召開與政黨的紛爭無關。然而我們卻又不能不承認當前政局的客觀事實，政府的忍讓爲國，迭有事實的證明，要以這次停戰的頒發令爲其頂點。由於此次停戰令的頒發，各方所要求於政府者，政府以極大的忍讓，都一一做到了。此後局勢的如何展開，端在各方的誠意合作。站在人民的立塲，我們希望各方亦能以事實來表現他們對於政府合作的至誠。例如對於國民大會的召開，各黨各派都能參加，共同來解决國事，國大是和平統一的重心，民主建設的開端；政府尊重各方意見，今旣頒停戰之令，則國大的召開，應該可以在和平的空氣下進行。至於關於軍事上的整編統編以及政治上的其它問題，其已成有協議者，應該迅予付諸實施，其尙未有協議者，在停戰命令設下和平空氣下，應該沒有不可以　采訪解决的事。</p>
<p>願田　　次戰令的頒發，拖延一年以上的國內局勢能够從此詳和光明！</p>

<p>我們十九個人的抱負　—記一羣有理想有熱情的靑年的集合</p>
<p>我從小學以至大學完畢，有過幾百位同學，也有過近百位朋友，但是在這裏我想說的，只是十八位。在目前，僅僅只是十八位，以後，我相信一定會多起來。</p>
<p>我很高興，我現在有着十八位有共同理想的年靑的友人。他們各各在學校時代都已經有過堅難刻苦的經歷，現在有的已經畢業，有的還在學校裏。我們都一致認爲目前的中國需要改革。我們痛恨封建的殘餘還在活躍；新興的惡勢力生生不已。我們仇視這時代裏一切不民主：假民主，不平等，不自由，以及永無止境的自私，永無止境的榨取，我們目覩着愚蠢和盲目，我們同情那些受難和永無完結的悲哀。我們覺得必需要改革它們，打倒它們，建立我們新的，合理的一切，我們不能也不敢相信別人會眞正完成這個使命。我們有勇氣，有抱負，將要來盡我們自己的力足，我們相信我們自己能够做得比別人更好。於是我們聯合起來，中間也費了一番聯誼的心血和經過一種應有的懷疑，但最後，我們變成了很好的友人：很好的同志，我相信，我們的結合，不是一時的情感，更不是盲目的行動，乃是用了我們縝密的理智，和冷靜的觀察而得到的。</p>
<p>我們找尋我們志同道合的友人的標準有三個，第一點：我們需要他（她）的天資比較的聰明，有足以理解複雜的問題的頭腦，有足以担當艱鉅工作的魄力，第二點：我們的友人必需要有遠大的理想，無論他信仰何種思想，祇要他最後的目的是要建設一個富强平等的新中國，對復興國家有自覺的責任心，對事業要有熱烈堅强的信心，我們不要那些徘徊悲哀的角色。第三點：我們的友人要不太自私，當然每個人或多或少有他的自私心，我們不必苛刻地要找毫無自私心的友人，而且事實上也是找不到。但是，億的自私是要有一個限度，換句話說：我們對於國家，對於友人，爲了國家還捨得犧牲。</p>
<p>我們十九個中，我相信，我比起他們，我是裏面最拙劣的一個，但唯其是最拙劣，因此也是最幸運，我可以從他們每一個中間學習他們的經騐和特色，而我的缺點他們也都能懇切的諒解。</p>
<p>我們這年靑的一羣，都生長在這一個時代裏。</p>
<p>這是一個最不幸的時代，同時也是最幸運的時代，何以呢？我們生活在這一個動亂，不安，貧乏，艱苦，苦悶的時代，更生長在這時代中最不幸的中國，我們不必說物質上受到了恐慌，受到了折磨，就是我們心靈上也蒙受了悲慘而黑　的暗影，我們的心地上有了創傷。我們不單憂愁着祖國的一切，並且還關心着動亂，殘忍，無知，盲從的所謂文明的人類的前途，我們因此承受了兩重的負担，使我們失去許多明朗的笑聲，失去了平靜安適的心靈的享受。我們煩惱，我們苦痛。而事實上我們可以不去負起這過重的心靈上的重壓。我們可以逃避去想牠，去關心牠，更可以　進狹小的個人的幸福的幻想　去，然而我們無論如何無法去擺脫牠。每天的報紙，彷彿是一個巨大的聲音，牠呼喚你。眼見的不平而悲慘的人間，彷彿是一支巨掌，牠抓住你，呌　去想牠，去關心牠，要你多少失去天眞的心靈的安靜，失去甜夢，得到的是過重的負担和折磨。</p>
<p>然而我們又　幸而生在這時代，更何幸而生在這時代裏的中國。因爲我們本不是想做一個平庸地渡過一生的凡人。我們眞何幸而生長在這可以容納我們去發展去創造的土地上，我們的事業的心理是萬分的堅强與熱烈，我們眞像一羣握着斧頭，鋸子，冀圖改造什麼或者建造什麼的年靑活潑天眞的工匠，看倒了那一座破落衰敗正需要重建的古舊的房屋。我們懷着躍躍欲試的心情，我們眞是何幸而生在中國，生長在這時代裏的中國！一切的物質的精神的折磨正好增强了我們的實力，增進了我們的毅力，我們的頭腦因此而變得更冷靜，我們目光因此而養成更銳利</p>
<p>我們決不是那種沒有絲毫社會經騐而空懷一腔熱心的年靑人，也不是老於世故而陰沉可怕的人物，我相信我自己如此，也相信我們每一個友人都如此。</p>
<p>我們雖具有一個遠大的共同的理想，但是我們都從最實際的地方着手。第一步我們先要養成我們自己對友人的愛心，誠心，信心。我們信賴每一個友人，每個人在必要時儘可能的帮助我們的友人。這是第一步的試騐，這一步如果不能達到，我們還談什麼　國家之類的理想？</p>
<p>我們每個人把友人的成敗視爲自己的成敗，友人的禍福視爲自己的禍福，我們相互鼓勵，相互善意的批評，我們各各仇視自己的劣點，也原諒友人的缺點。</p>
<p>我們每一個友人都打算從自己的本位上工作起，建立個人的級濟基礎，有一位唸工科的友人，他已經從一家小規模的營造廠開始，他的理想是成立一家現代化大規模的建築工程企業。有一位江西農專的友人，他準備在畢業後去雲南開墾。每一個友人都在本位上工作，發展他的事業，建立他的經濟基礎。我們有很好的通信以及旅行聯誼的辦法，維繫我們的友情，在十年之後，再來配合各各的成就，達到一個綜合的成功。</p>
<p>我眞高興：我們現有的友人已經分佈在中國國內各重要地點了，像瀋陽·北平·上海·杭州·南京·武漢·成都·南昌。從學校的名稱來說吧；東北·淸華·北大·中大·臨大·武漢·交大·震旦·浙大·川大。從科系來說吧，工程·法律。文學·敎育·經濟·農藝·政治·和航空工程等。今年還有一部份友人沒有畢業，兩年之後，每一個友人都可以進入了社會。</p>
<p>這是一個科學的羣衆時代，孤軍奮鬥決不能有大的成就，因此我們在今後努力找尋我們的朋友，理智地發現我們的同志，五年之後，我們的友人不但可遍於國內，而且可以滿佈在海外了。</p>
<p>我相信這一大羣的靑年友人乃是眞正中國的新血輪，也唯有我們這靑年一羣才是中國的改造者。同時中國的重建也唯有我們靑年正義的結合才能負起這個使命。</p>
<p>我的話說得很自負，不，簡直是自大了吧：但是我寗願自負，自大，決不願退避和自卑</p>
<p>最後，我祝我的友人們康健！（潘星照卅五，十月，）</p>

<p>〔本報東京特派員七日電〕一年內日本生產指數曲綫之上昇速度雖緩，但較去年八月投降時則已增加二倍以上，司謂已逐漸步入經濟穩定之局面。據商工省統計數字，如以一九三一年至一九三三年爲平均數之一百，去年九月之生產指數僅達百分之二十，本年八月則爲百分之五四·四，較去年度增二·七倍。據日本銀行最近發表之統計，如以本身三月爲平均數之一百，本年七月爲百分之一五六，八月則爲一六六。國有鐵路之運貨數量亦隨之逐日增加，據東洋</p>
<p>經濟統計</p>
<p>如以一九四一年爲平均數之一百，去年九月僅八·三，本年八月則爲百分之七六·三。再就物價而論，亦有漸趨穩定之勢，據東京商工經濟會之調査，如以去年十一月爲平均數之一百，黑市物價指數木年九月爲百分之一二七·三，較八月之百分之三五减低百分之五·七。物價以本年四月爲頂點，曾上升至百分之一四一·三，其後即逐漸下降，日本銀行最近發表之統計數字，亦顯示黑市有逐漸下降之趨勢，如以本年三月爲平均數之一百，本年九月則爲八九。反之，公定價格大增，有與</p>
<p>黑市價格</p>
<p>接近之勢，如以本年三月爲平均數之一百，九月則爲百分之二·四，再就通貨發行額而論，發行額增加之勢亦漸趨鈍化。日政府於本年三月實施金融揹置令以後，三月底日本銀行劵之發行額，曾縮減爲二百三十億元，其後因糧食恐慌發生，與生計費及工資有關之存款提出驟增，致通貨</p>
<p>發行大增</p>
<p>迄本月廿七日已增至七百零二億二千五百萬元，實已超過舊有之發行最高額。但最近糧荒情勢已見好轉，發券之增加額已趨鈍化，如六月份之增加率爲百分之一八，十月則爲百分之一〇，此後日本經濟活動之最重要關鍵，在生產能否繼續上升恢復正常之經濟關係。就</p>
<p>目前生產</p>
<p>情形而論，尙不能驟下樂觀之結論，蓋一年來生產原料多取自原有之儲存，長此以往，如無資材及原料自國外輸入，即有吿罄之處。勞資糾紛亦佔一重要因素，又如石炭，六月以來每月僅產一百六七十萬噸。其他如鋼鐵肥料之生產仍舊不振，例如鋼材七月至九月間供給量，預定生產量爲五萬五千噸，使用原有之儲存品四萬五千噸計十萬噸，而十月至十二月之供給計劃，生產量爲五萬七千噸，儲存品及特種物品一萬六千噸，合計七萬三千噸，較九月减少二萬七千噸。關於此種經濟指標之見解，</p>
<p>朝野各方</p>
<p>之見解悲觀論者及樂觀論者各執一詞。楢橋藏相稱：三月以來，物價保持相當穩定之現象，將來採用之政策如無錯誤，則絕對不致引起通貨膨脹。「每日新聞」對於藏相之論調則加以反駁，該報於廿五日社論中稱，本年三月實施</p>
<p>金融措置</p>
<p>今後，一時流通最膨脹至六百八十億之通貨，曾收縮爲一百六十億，迄九月再膨脹至六百億，物價始略吿穩定，此乃人爲緊急措置之結果。且日本銀行之指數對於主要食品之價格過於重視，本年豐作，故主要食品之價格乃吿下降，但遠不及貨幣價値低落之速，因之對於即將播布大量通貨之日本財政，不得構成樂觀之材料，此三月至九月期間僅可謂之爲一時之小，但政府未曾予以利用，以造成</p>
<p>日本復興</p>
<p>之真正基礎，致日本經濟復興迄未步入正軌，誠屬遺憾。惟以藏相爲後台老板之東洋經濟難誌則甚抱樂觀，於廿九日刋經濟中曾謂增加生產並非不可能之事，物價旣漸趨穩定，商業經營之損益之前得以預料，如材料資材之供給趨於圓滑時，</p>
<p>增加生產</p>
<p>乃輕而易舉之事。戰前石炭曾月產五六百萬噸，一旦經營得法，生產自易增加，惟自力更生以求經濟復興亦有限度，蓋目前原料資材不仰給於國外，伹旣須仰給國外資材之輸入，故在某種限度內，仍須在自力更生之前提下促進生產，以交換輸入物資，因之目前之情形，與其謂之爲通貨膨脹已趨惡化，母寗是光明在望，使目前生產指數再行上昇，乃日人之義務云。</p>

<h3>今晨一時十五分　中國之友端納病逝　明日在萬國殯儀館大殮即行安葬　遺囑將賻作義交勵志社贈慈善機關　蔣夫人飛滬昨曾兩往探視</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣主席前顧問端納氏，於今晨一時十五分在宏恩醫院病故。上海勵志社（南京西路二〇〇四號）已奉命辦理治喪事宜。遺體於今日移往膠州路萬國殯儀館，十日上午九時至十二時設奠，下午二時大殮，舉行簡單儀式後，即日安葬於虹橋路萬國公墓。端納遺囑，所有賻儀，交由勵志社損贈各慈善機關。</p>
<p>〔本報特稿〕深秋的寒風帶來了無限蕭索。片片黄葉悄然離枝，宏恩醫院似乎比平日更冷淸了。三天來，七十一歲高年的端納，已經進入彌留狀態。這位向「死」搏鬥的戰士，終於漸漸面臨了無可抗禦的「必然」。</p>
<p>在梗香山，好幾位醫師都吿訴過他，今生已無康復之望。但是他終於仍舊回到了念念不忘的中國，而且，終於仍舊看見了完成抗戰偉業的蔣主席和蔣夫人。死，對端納，是無所用其恐懼的。在馬尼拉，落在早想得他而甘心的日本兵手裏的時候，他早已有死的可能了。接着的又是集中營要四年曼長的歲月！</p>
<p>其實，在西安事變的時候，他又何嘗沒有遭到毒手的機會！</p>
<p>每一次危險到來，他祇是向危險挑戰；他在每一次挑戰中都得到了勝利。</p>
<p>但是，三天以來，興奮的幽默的語聲在暗淡的病房中終於消失。從此，他不再能說話了—無限的靜默；漸漸伸張出來的黑影；從永恒來的，終將回到永恒。</p>
<p>最後的一句話，是對他的書記說的，他間：「幾點鐘了？」</p>
<p>爲甚麽還要問鐘點呢？他還有所等待麼？</p>
<p>昨天，蔣夫人和馬帥夫人在中午十二點三十五分飛到了上海。蔣夫人在回到公館後兩三分鐘就到了宏恩醫院。端納的神志還是淸醒的，向蔣夫人含笑點頭，但是—即使有千言萬語想說，也說不出來了。</p>
<p>這兩天來，鄭祖穆醫師已不斷爲他施行强心針注射，因爲端納呼吸困難，所以也已經借重　氣。蔣夫人是十二點五十分到醫院的，同去的是黄仁霖氏，和侍衛官蔣祥慶。下午二點十分離院。晚上六點半，蔣夫人再度探訪，到八點才又離開。</p>
<p>鄭醫生輕輕地說：「從現在起—隨時都有可能性了。」</p>
<p>無數政治秘密將在沈默中消失。黑暗中，那一對銳利而慈祥的眼睛似乎在我的面前呈現了。</p>
<p>（又訊）蔣夫人宋美齡女士以端納氏病况轉危，特於昨日上午由京搭馬歇爾元帥四引擎專機於十二時三十五分趕抵此間。同來者尙有馬歇爾夫人及黄總幹事仁霖。夫人御深咖啡色外衣，上鑲米色領邊，內御淺紫色長旗袍。赴龍華機塲歡迎者有吳市長夫婦，宣司令鐵吾等。夫人下機後，即偕馬夫人返東平路私邸。夫人以急欲探視端納，抵官邸陪送馬夫人上樓後，僅歷時三分鐘，即乘車偕黄總幹事赴宏恩醫院。</p>

<h3>江水冬漸減退　上游適宜淺水輪　招商局川江綫將受影響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕時屆冬季，揚子江水勢漸形减退，川江湘河將入枯水時期，北洋錢天津牛莊安東等地，亦將冰河。據航海界稱：牛莊的半月後即有冰凍之狀，惟天津今年氣候與往年不同，如天氣無大變，白河不致冰凍。長江水位已略見下退，昨據報吿（七日）九江二十尺零九，漢口二十一尺三，宜昌十七尺二，重慶十六尺八，長沙零下六寸，六尺以上吃水之船舶已不能行駛。川江水位今後恐祇退無漲，故行駛川江之船隻，適宜淺水江輪，招商局雖有江康·江慶·江陵三艘，惟最適合於行駛川江之江康輪，已由大達大通聯營處收買，該局曾迭呈交部，要求政院復議，並原以安華等二江輪調換，結果無效。而江陵輪正在修理中，年內尙難修復，江慶輪噸位太小，運輸不敷，在枯水時行駛上游，馬力亦成問題。本年冬季川江綫，該局將受重大影響。</p>

<h3>大西洋上失散　飄零四千哩　小女孩歷經顛沛　四年後竟慶珠還　亂世中一幕傳奇似的悲喜劇</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在人生舞台上，原來就有着一幕幕演不完的悲喜劇。當戰爭的時期，這舞台上更增添了不知多少悲歡難合，可歌可泣的故事。在這裏面，悲劇往往是遠多於喜劇的，在千萬個不幸遭遇中，我們難得能發現一二個歡樂的結局，實在不能不算一個「奇蹟」。這裏是一個事實，叙述一個慈母和她的愛女在敵人的轟炸下失散四年半，遠隔四千哩，音訊杳然，結果竟能團圓。原來昨日，安和寺路三四八號李淸茂夫人家中，就爲着這樣一個神妙的奇蹟的降臨，揚溢着喜氣，充滿了感謝的情緒。</p>
<p>一九四二年二月十三日，僑居新加坡的李德樵夫人李月嫦女士（已故名眼科專家李淸茂的女兒），在日寇殘酷的砲火中，帶了她六歲的女兒白蒂二歲的小女兒洛蒂，搭乘難民輪「古拉」號逃生。那時李　樵先生另乘一船，已經失散。不幸在開船後第二天，「古拉」號就被敵機炸中，迅速下沉。在這千鈞一髮的當兒，李女士祇能抱整小女兒洛蒂，然後吿訴小白蒂叫她抓住一隻箱子的提手勿　。而　自己不　游泳，在神智昏眩的剎那，小洛蒂不知不覺地從她的懷抱中溜了出去。</p>
<p>當她醒來的時候，李女士發現自己和其他許多乘客却被日人救起，而她的兩個女兒都已不知去向了。三月以後，她從日人的集中營偸逃出來，搭了一只沙船逃回了新加坡。從此，李女士孤零地生活，在痛苦懷念和希望中，洒盡了慈母失去愛女的熱淚，憧憬着有一天愛女重入她懷抱的夢二年，二年，一直過了四個半悲哀的年頭。</p>
<p>蒼天終於給了她一個最後的機曾。原來白蒂靠了她的救生物——一只箱子，漂泊在大海中，給日人救了上岸，帶到四千哩外的瓜達加納爾島，交給了營中的一個老媽子。在此期間，小白蒂受盡了苦難。直到瓜島被美軍克復，當地居民在一個溝渠中，發現了一個被遺棄的小女孩，她的頭後給日人槍柄打傷，兩臂被軍刀戳傷，可憐的少生命已經奄奄垂斃。她便是小白蒂。居民們不忍眼看着她殞滅，把她送到美海軍的營裏，交給營中收師蓋林收管。蓋牧師曾在中國傳教多年，熟諳中國方言有八種之多，可是小白蒂依舊不能和他通話，謹吿訴他名字呌白蒂，因此蓋收師就替她取了個名字呌Patsy。</p>
<p>小白蒂幸運地漸漸漸恢復了她的健康，由美軍當局送到了愛斯比利多桑多和艾范特地方兩孤兒院內。當時有個紐約時報記者海利曾發表過二篇文章，述及這個流落異鄕的中國小女孩。這時候，李女士的令妹林李月娥女士正在紐約某醫院研究癌症，在報上看到這消息後，即猜想這是她的小外甥女。去年八月戰事結束，李月娥女士立即寫信把這喜訊吿訴她姊姊，李月婦女士悲喜交集，急忙寫信給海利和蓋林，向他們證實她有一個失踪的孩子，正和他們所說的相符合。</p>
<p>最後，李女士費盡了力量與口舌，經過了多少的折磨，終於由新加坡乘飛機到澳洲的雪梨城，再搭法汽船到達維拉。她帶了小白蒂的相片字跡，還說明了她左眼邊有一個小瘡疤，證明那的確是她幾乎失去了的愛女。</p>
<p>可是，時隔四年半，（小白蒂在這月一日已過十一歲生日）當她見到了她母親後，竟已不能相識。李女士熱淚滿襟說：「我也不認識她了。」但終於小白蒂高興非常，在她母親的懷抱中回到了新加坡。</p>
<p>好像一般似的，這一幕悲劇變成了喜劇。可是，還有小洛蒂呢！還是毫無音訊。我們和李女士伺樣地希望還有第二個「奇蹟」降臨！</p>
<p>未失散時的小白蒂，年纔六歲</p>
<p>四年半後，得慶生還，小白蒂竟不認識她媽媽了。</p>
<h3>謀職業竟送死　狠心男女合謀勒斃本夫　中興路小河浜無名男屍案大白　拘獲兩凶犯詳供經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北中與路育嬰堂門口，三日晚八時，發現被害男屍一具，用繩索束縛其雙手，拋置於小浜內，詳情已誌本報。當時閘北分局警員在死者身畔抄獲香烟匣一，內藏通行證一紙，上戴崇明興隆鄕第一保第四甲顧毓才，卅歲。應分局長乃令股長王守遴派幹警時學良，陳福林至崇明調査，尋至顧毓才家，詳問之下，知死者即爲顧無疑。乃帶顧母秦氏（七十九歲）來滬，山警局詳詢之後；得悉其媳顧程翠英，卅歲，在滬西新申九廠爲女工，上月間，氏曾返鄕一次，其子毓才亦擬來滬工作，托氏代覓棲枝。據氏云在上海做生意須備現金一二百萬爲押櫃。其後接得翠英由滬來信，謂已謀得輪船生意，惟須帶款來申。三日晨，毓才即乘輪來滬，並云其媳翠英住在曹家渡存善里十九號戚串家。於是派警員前往調查，據該號中人稱，她已多時不來食宿，復往新申九廠尋覓，亦不得要領。後據一祟明男工楊佩玉云，僅知其弟程錫介（廿一歲）在江灣萬安路福昌新麵粉廠爲練習生，繼將錫介帶局偵訊，供出姊在閘北談家橋四號。七日遂帶其至該處尋覓，卒將該婦與其姘夫徐梅芳一併拘獲，帶局預審，始吐眞情。據徐梅芳供，卅八歲，蘇州人，在談家橋四號開設圓桶作，七月間，因前妻病故，經人介紹，與程翠英姘居。程翠英供認顧毓才即係渠所殺害，事前與姘夫商討，本夫來滬時，姘居情形將難守秘密。徐即主張將毓才於到滬後謀斃。故連日飭程至輪埠守候，三日下午，渠偕一手帕交同往，不料徐亦尾隨於後，未幾輪船抵滬，毓才果由輪上岸，迨會晤後，小姊妹即離去。渠與夫偕往先施樂園觀劇，後外出進晚膳，而徐隨後寸步不離。繼乃說謊，謂生意已謀就，須同至北站會晤介紹人，即可獲得工作。毓才深信不疑，同趁電車至新閘橋徒步朝北，至中興路時，該處黑暗異常，徐見四顧無人，將預備之糧索取出，背後套住丈夫頸部，斯時丈夫猝不及防，即翻身倒地，被其收緊繩索，須臾氣絕畢命，然後再捆綁其雙手，棄於附近小浜內云云。即經錄取口供後，申解司法機關究辦。</p>

<h3>消滅浦江竊風　注意工作小工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於浦江竊風甚熾事，記者特走訪水上警分局負責人，據稱：對於水上竊風，絕對可無問題。綠船上竊盜可分二種：（一）碼頭小工，因工價過低，不數生計，往往利用工作上便利，在散工時，乘機竊取貸物。數量雖不多，然總計實屬可觀。現本分局正着手撲滅工作，進行步驟，第一採取工頭方面嚴加管束。每逢散工時，遣派便衣員　到塲監視，如遇有上項事件發生，即拘捕究辦。（二）竊盜混在工人中行竊。每遇外洋輪抵埠開倉卸貨時，乃密派幹警馳往，逐一檢査小工符號。凡遇有非屬工人，混跡艙中者，即逮捕訊究。邇來分局決心肅淸浦江竊風，並希望各輪船公司隨時協助，以利推進。遇有事件發生，可即電吿八八八六七或八八〇六一號。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕義泰興煤球廠經理沈錦洲漢奸嫌疑案，昨日上午由高院審理終結，定十五日上午九時半宣判。按沈現年六十歲，餘姚人，勝利後被人檢舉，指稱：太平洋戰爭發生後，上海煤炭來源悉入敵手，所來煤斤均由日商三井，三菱，山下等公司組織之石炭聯合會統制經營，沈錦洲乃與大昌十六家同業商號集資組織大中聯煤號，沈被推任理事長，向石炭聯合會請購煤斤，因數量不足，乃以配給方式供應全市，卅三年該煤號改組爲大巾聯煤斤統配處，沈復被推任爲常務理事，其業務仍似前述。卅四年一月起，因敵人在太平洋戰事失利，缺乏航運，該煤號乃派民船前往靑島運煤來滬，半數供敵軍用，半數供應全市。</p>
<p>該案自經高檢處起訴後，高院數度開庭調査，沈均否認以煤資敵。昨日提訊時，未待開口，已淚如雨下，泣不成聲。供稱：太平洋戰起，上海所有之煤炭皆由石炭聯合會統制，致市面上煤炭大感缺乏，各店號無貨應市，市民無煤球可燒。是時原有同業公會之負責人已星散，乃有甚多同業至我處要求設法救濟，遂組織大中聯煤斤統配處，向該石炭聯合會登記，配得煤斤後，轉配同業零售予市民。因僧多粥少，分配不能平均，致爲少數同業所忌，乃有本案之發生。至言自靑島運煤來滬資敵，並無其事。請求庭上宣吿無罪云。</p>

<h3>旅滬西班牙　回力球員　有了新出路　美新設球塲在滬招聘　不少已應約赴美獻技</h3>

<h3>勝利一年來　肺癆病情愈見猖獗　（下）</h3>
<p>其中心肺正常者，僅佔全數五分之二，而患有肺病者，竟達七九五人，居全數百分之二四·六五，爲數驚人，突破該院以往一切紀錄。肺癆患者之年齡，最幼者爲一歲，最高者爲五十九歲，最多者爲廿二歲，在患者七九五人中，佔五十四人之多；其次爲廿三歲至廿六歲，均佔四十餘人；自十八歲起至三十三歲，爲肺癆患者之最高峯，共計五八二人，佔總數百分之七十三弱，謂爲人生最危險之年齡，亦無不可。本市肺癆攻勢之熾烈，於此可見一斑！深望各方急加注意，共同協力，勿使此危害都市及民族健康之巨患，日益加深，同時處身此大都市中之羣衆，亦應自覺肺癆潛伏之危險，時時有展開新攻勢襲擊我人之健康，人人應及早檢查，一方使病者可獲早期治愈之機會，而自絕染源。一方可使人知所防範，而避免傳染，爲公身利害計，爲公衆安全計，實應有此賢明之措置也。</p>
<p>據聯總肺結核專家山道博士在倫敦記者招待會稱：中國學生患肺病者特多，較之世界其他各地壯年，超出四五倍之多，因中國未能獲致基本衛生設備及個人預防檢査，數百萬人將死於肺病云云。可知肺癆之摧殘靑年，爲數實堪驚人，莘莘學子，在求學時代，大都均在危險之年齡，而處身於此肺癆猖獗之都市，隨時隨地、允多傳染之機會，若不及早檢査，非特肺部健康狀况無從明瞭，抑且使潛伏肺病者自認爲健康，而遷延失治，徒作無謂犧牲、我靑年學子，其亦知所警惕乎！</p>
<h3>讀者諮詢　醫藥衛生</h3>
<p>（一）神經失常</p>
<p>楊一和問　小女年已而立尙未婚嫁。患有神經不正常症，每逢經期前一星期，即感頭痛。言語舉動漸失常態，肝火上冲及至天癸來臨，則進入昏迷狀態若醉酒狀，與之交談槪不理睬，但飲食照常，並且食量增加，經期過後三四日始恢復常態。理智淸明，待人接物周詳無遺。此病起於四年前在棲霞小學敎讀時，嗣回家修養，並未診治，歷二月始愈，去年四月起定期按月發作，此種病症是否與婚姻問題有關，有無特效醫治辦法，敬請賜答。</p>
<p>〔醫學博士唐仁縉答〕由各種症狀方面觀察而言，似爲內分泌失調所致。與婚姻問題或有關係，可試用濾胞及卵黄體等劑，但以就診於婦科專門醫師，較爲妥當。</p>
<p>（二）酒精中毒</p>
<p>余吉甫問　家父今年五十六歲，嗜酒，平日體力素弱，多嗽多痰。本年四月間，左手左足陷於麻木，經數度延醫診治，均未見效，請問此病是否係酒精中毒所致？有吾治療之藥物？</p>

<h3>批發門市利潤均有限制　棉紗市場交易冷落　高價吃進之貨只得設法運銷外埠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自吳市長於日前召見紗商代表，面諭轉飭各同業，切遵棉紗議價交易後，昨晨紗商業公會理事長唐志良，曾在該業公會，通知各同業切實奉行。同時公會中張貼緊急警吿稱：昨奉吳市長面諭：「紗商業同業應各遵守棉紗限價，批發利潤百分之五，門市利潤百分之十，不得超過此項規定，如違嚴懲不貸，仰即轉吿同業，一體遵行爲要」等語，奉此，用特緊急警吿，希各遵行毋遠，切切此吿。質言之，即公會市塲上現貨買賣，廿支紗不得高於一百八十三萬七千五百元，然事實上非但客帮不易購得現貨，即業中人照此限價，亦難向紗廠買獲，是以形成僵局，缺乏成交，僅十支十六支紗，有小額交易，廿支以上各紗，因退款迄未淸訖，而各紗商手中之紗，大多爲二百萬元關外成交者。估計該項價格成交之棧單貨，當在萬件以上，即待淸理了結。至其他二百萬元關外成交之現貨，只能設法運銷外埠。各紗商已表示，今後本市各檔棉紗，決遵議價交易。又聞昨日紡建民營各廠，亦有棉紗多件裝運外埠云。</p>
<p>又昨日下午四時許，紡管會業務處長劉文騰，召見紗商代表唐志良周家聲等，吿以日前紡管會議決之各要案，着即遵行。唐周兩代表會提出意見兩點：（一）中央信託局叠次代理政府標售物資所出售之紗布，向按黑市最高價售出。該批棉紗之溢價，是否亦可退還。（二）本市英商怡和綸昌兩廠，向按市價開紗，是否亦可按議價多退少補。聞紡管會方面，以尙未考慮及此，故未有確切答覆，惟允將該項意見，備案討論。</p>
<p>又悉：本市國民營各廠，目前每月產紗總額，的爲六萬五千件。此中百分之卅六，係配售予各複製品工業。百分之卅五，係由各設有織布機之紗廠自用。百分之八，係運銷華南。百分之廿一，係由國民營各廠自行運銷外埠。</p>
<h3>食油問題　吳市長召集會議　禁止任意狂漲　即將成立統一配售機構　貸款問題今日開會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長以日來油市暴漲，特於昨日下午二時卅分，召集食油有關各方面，在市府會議室舉行談話會。計到謝裕祥，王樹新，張德潤，張超，吉明齋，黃家駒，傳昌裕等。吳市長對日前油市猛漲，極爲震怒。當剴切吿諭各油商，如有因難，應儘量提出，討論解決辦法。如任油市任意在漲，當局將予斷然處置。旋即由與會各代表分陳意見，茲誌討論經過及其決定如次：（一）本市每月需食汕三萬六千担，此數由中國食油公司及中國植物油廠各配售一萬担。其餘不足之數，由民營廠八家分担之。巾食每逢週一，三，五，各配售一次。中植每逢週二，四，六，各配售一次。各民營廠昨日配出七百廿担，自今日起，每日將配售七百担。各廠配汕，概照議價，即豆油每担九萬八千元，生油每担九萬九千元，蔴汕每担九萬二千元。（二）榨油成本，據廠商表示，豆每担市價二萬八千元，每担榨工三千五百元，可榨油十斤，豆餅四十八斤（合一張有九）。所苦者，即目前豆餅，並不當令，無法出售，且須坐耗拆息。故望能將該項豆餅裝運台灣。又靑島生汕來本，亦多超過目前官價。日前靑島有生油一千五百桶裝到，吳市長當着仍先照官價出售。再商辦法。（三）植物汕廠方面，擬請增加電力，以便增產，吳市長當吿以十一月杪，電力問題可有辦法。（四）批發汕商利潤，議決照議價加百分之三。零售汕商以耗蝕較多，故利潤照議價加百分之十，不得超過。（五）由市銀行貸款五憶元，作爲民營油廠購買原料之用。但所榨之汕，應隨榨隨售，直接配售予零售商。</p>
<p>聞當局爲統一配油步驟，將於最近籌設一配汕總機稱。所有國民營各廠產油，將集中該一機構統配云。又吳市長將於今日下午召集中央信託局，市銀行，台灣貿易公司，台糖公司，及榨油業公會等代表，共商貸款及豆餅運銷台灣等問題云。</p>
<p>昨日油市，已略見平靜。惟廣東，汕頭，厦門，寗波各幫，採辦頗殷，對市價不無影饗。然各檔食油價，仍較日前軋小。計生油十二萬元，豆油十一萬二千元，較日前各小二千元。</p>
<h3>米市到貨多　粳秈無變動</h3>
<p>米市南北共到一萬一千餘石，店胃依然淸懈，北市早堅午定，無所榮辱，南市因南帮各路來貨蟬聯，市塲交易有限，繼續下挫千元，北粳高貨尙定，秈米軟化，白元少上落，陰元亦無出入，黃豆來貨甚湧，外埠去化不動，油廠納胃不佳，再跌千元，豆餅汕頭停辦，零化不動，價形平　，麩皮亦然，粉市不振，回小一二百元，小麥續降三五百元，芝蔴去路香燥，盤升千元，生仁魯豫蘇北均有到貨，依然下游，步跌二三千元，赤豆續跌二三千元</p>
<h3>央行繼續拋售　金價較前微降</h3>
<p>烚赤昨形勢轉盤，晨開二四二萬光景，央行仍來壓迫，實銷方面之銀樓帮，亦因時近配給，暫吿觀望，不久即破入二四〇萬內，跌至二三八萬，而後暫吿靜止，十時後央行以二三九萬五之價，配售六〇條，此後擁資者仍有納胃，不久又問升至二四〇萬外，午刻再挺進至二四二萬，午後隔日交割上塲尙形小秀，經央行儘量拋出期貨後，臨收復屈居二四〇萬以內，結果較前收續降一萬八，飾金廿五萬四，紋銀平而銀元微降，暗拆銀根尙平，息價仍在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣平定，美鈔暗市約四一〇〇元至四一五〇元，與前日相同，港票亦在前價徘徊，結果與前日相同，港匯仍在實銷吿淡下，無人需求，昨八七〇元有售，印匯一〇五五元，英匯一四一〇〇元，都屬賣價，成交更少，美滙牌價依舊呆滯無交易做開。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕日繭輪華之談判，因麥帥總部認爲此事對於美國國民經濟有關，非總部所宜決定，已將此事移交國務院辦理。故目下談判之重心，亦已由東京轉移至華盛頓。中絲公司負責人爲此事於本星期一晋京謁宋院長，請示機宜，已於星期三返滬。今後此事將由我國駐美大使館與美政府直接折衝，中絲公司駐紐約之代表，如外部需其協助時，亦將參與，以備諮詢。有關人士對記者表示：談判之結果難作預測，我國自將悉力以赴；但有兩點事實，應加以注意：第一，美國有扶植日本絲業之旣定政策，日蘭大量輸華，與此政策相遠反；其次，如以日繭供給我國之絲織業，其產品之質地，比較日貨爲劣，不合乎美國之需要。同時我國之絲，在目前及將來，銷塲不限於美國，故對於美國而首，當然不及日絲之易於控制也。記者詢以目前我國之廠家已吾有生絲缺乏之感，答爲缺絲之廠家已有，但就全部而論，情形尙不嚴重。</p>
<h3>遞交又在盛傳　華股由疲轉穏</h3>
<p>華股昨形勢飄忽，空方以借貨維艱，難免忐忑，一七六號大量傾售，漲後又回，局勢不定，晨開各股平疲，開後略有下游，經一七一號二三二號等逢低維持，漸見起色，檯面由空翻多，塲外亦起軋空，不久買風頓起，永紗回出六百元大關，高後漸趨徘徊，又復退入關內，一七六號一再賣出永紗信和，檯面漸鬆，一九八號亦售，漸入疲途，無如一七六號賣意川流不止，散戶心神不定，斬多又起，近午都見低價，十一時三刻後塲外有補，二三二號仍來吸納，午收呈盤旋之局，較前收計永紗景福新光微跌，美亞信和勤興稍升，冷股中升降不一，午後上塲因隔週交割，買氣見殷，加上下週三「遞交」可以實行之說，各股一度回漲，惟一九八號及塲外放空，仍未全泯，無力更上一層，終於在散賣凑集下，復吿回低，臨收漸穩，結果較前收熟股計永紗景福新光微降，美亞信和勤興略漲，冷股以巾絲跌至停板，五和跌一成强，餘者榮辱均微，總成交額共一二四六萬股，塲外各股亦再低落。</p>
<p>外股賣戶仍殷，買方束手旁觀，成交不多，紙業幾成有行無市，會德豐尙穩定，餘者均在多方了結下趨疲，結果較前收計業廣會德　穩定，怡紗英聯微挫，餘者各跌半成左右</p>
<h3>布市客銷漸動</h3>
<p>布市稍見抬頭，因迎日客銷活動，天津帮吸收允巨，一般觀測，咸以有欣欣向榮之象，然終因紡建大量拋售，上漲終鮮勁力，昨市龍頭細布開八萬三千元，四君子嗶嘰老貨九萬四千元，惟常州貨反猛漲五六千元，加官細布則較前低價漲一萬元，喊六萬九千元，象頭則喊七萬二千元。</p>
<h3>麥爾登到銷均旺</h3>
<p>美國麥爾登呢，目今在呢羢門中，占極重要地位，行情之大路硬旺，無出其右，同業中賣買，除自己直接向洋行定到外，絕難圖利，一般掮客轉手，佣金每碼亦不過一二百元或五十元耳，因交易之廣繁需硬旺，必須一律現鈔進出，業中人因之俱呼爲金條，蓋其立刻可以兌現也，然因市貨充沛，致行情始終平平，白邊昨沽三萬三千元，粉紅邊三萬二千元，本色邊三萬一千元。</p>
<h3>生鐵不繼仰仗舊鐵　馬鞍山礦已毀美貨稀少　市價步漲配售恐難辦到</h3>
<p>〔木報訊〕生鐵市况，近因到貨稀少，而本街存底極薄，遂星俏利。計新貨生鐵，每噸價在一百二三十萬之間。舊貨生鐵，每噸價亦達一百萬元。而五月前之市價，新舊貨生鐵每噸價不過卅萬元左右。據鐵業公會某負責人語記者：國內生鐵主要來源，爲產自九江馬鞍山之鐵礦。該礦蘊藏宏富，惜受戰事破壞，一時不能作正常之供應，否則產量實可供全國耗用而有餘。勝利後，本市新貨生鐵主要來源，大多係向美國定貨運來。惟美國對生鐵之出口許可證，時發時輟，故供應量極爲有限。總計勝利迄今，自美國運到之生鐵，不過五六千噸。現各生鐵商除向美國定貨外，間亦向香港方面發動定貨，該地生鐵，多來自英國印度。目前本市因生鐵缺貨，各鐵商平日生鐵來源，大多係向南京，鎭江，無錫，蘇州一帶，搜購舊生鐵，以應需用。至配售生鐵一說，雖有人請求，但可能性似極微渺云。</p>

<h3>致毛澤東先生　知無不言書　「蘇皖邊區政府」「華中文化協會」</h3>
<p>— 顧問　朱尭天　（上）</p>
<p>澤東先生：</p>
<p>本來我預備去延安的，爲了交通上的不方便，所以行到　　就停留下來，一年來除了承你羣中高級幹部給予二　闢可名　外，我個人又經營二個商業性的東西，一個是　出平　的國民大戲院，一個是買賣古今文物的　往館，看到這里，你也會說一句「又是個自私的傢伙」，但是你也許會不相信吧？如果我不經營二個商業性的東西，在「許進不許出」的「解放區」，我是絕對沒有方法能够走出來的，爲了我個人的自由，爲了好多「聽見人家說」，因而走上絕路朋友們的自由，我不得不這樣做，事實上也不龍不這樣做，敬希你口下留情呢！</p>
<p>參加集會訪問　達數百次之多</p>
<p>在這一年中間，我以　料顧問資格，參加華中的大小集會有數十次，而　人的各方訪問，共有數百次之多，由於我以商人姿態的緣故，得到各方面的衷心吐露，我深信比你派遺吃公糧穿公衣的同志們，要更眞實更可靠的多，本來預備把這些寳貴的羣衆反映，以你們加給我的頭銜，什麽民主人士，什麽前進份子的姿態，出版一個批評性的刋物，依事情的輕重，按期分別刋載，然而在言論絕對不許自由的「解放區」，有話只好放在肚皮深處，否則受到警吿事小，要是加上「特務」帽子，那眞的只有天曉得了！</p>
<p>我是八月一十七日早晨離開淮陰的，九月上旬才到達上海，爲了飽嚐「解放區」行路難的苦味，所以回來後便感到不大適宜，因此這個早就想給你的「知無不言」書，到今天才寫出來，在沒有言歸正傳以前，似乎應當向你有個聲明，以免發生誤會，我是個以文化敎育事業爲終身職業的人，從來就沒有參加過任何黨派，更不是你的幹部們談不離口的什麽「特務」，同時我也自信，旣不是你們掛在嘴邊上的什麼「頑固份子」，也不是你們做夢也在呌的什麽「反動派」，我是以純中國文化人立塲，說些中國文化人應該說的話，如果你眞在實踏「言者無罪，聽者足戒」的話，那末我這個「知無不言」書，它不但對一般「聽見人家說」的知識份子與半知識份子是有利的，封中觀共產黨的前途也是有利的。</p>
<p>先從理論說起吧　從來不會生產　却向別人革命</p>
<p>我想馬克思先生寫共產主義學說的唯一觀點，應該是「剝削」二個字，而「剝削」狀態的形成，應該是「生產」二個字，而「生產」二個字的担當者，應該是眞正的工人與農人，就是說，一個工人或是一個農人，他的血汗所得，被一個非工人與非農人給「剝削」了去，造成的現象是生產者飢寒交迫，不生產者，也就是「剝削」者，却飽食暖衣，這現象擴大下去的結果，便形成了階級對立，由階級對立，進而到階級鬥爭，也就是社會主義革命，進而到共產主義革命、如果我這種說法是對的話，那末一個革命者的先決條件，他應該是一個具有絕對性的眞正生產者，不然便沒有「剝削」的形成，沒有「剝削」的形成，便沒有　級的對立，沒有階級的對立，　沒有階級鬥爭，沒有階級鬥爭，當然說不上什麼社會主義革命　與共產主義革命者，如果一個從來就是非工非農的白吃飽者，也就是從來就不曾生產過者，我想通種人在目前，他只有別人向他革命的資格，他決沒有向別人革命的資格，然而你領導的中國布爾什維克，似乎沒有重視到這一點。</p>
<p>舉個典型例子吧　喫公糧穿公服　到底誰剝削誰</p>
<p>毛先生以下各高級幹部，究竟有多少是工農出身的生產份子呢？如果旣不是工農出身的生產份子，那末吃飽了善良老百姓的公糧，穿暖了善良老百姓的公衣，便大搖大擺高喊着「順我者昌，逆我者亡」口號而革起命來，這到底是誰「剝削」誰呢？我想除了「革命是近代一種新興職業」的說法外，實在尋不出第二個解釋來，至於你手製的「新民主主義」，旣非减租，也非减息，已經百分之百，千分之千做了你各級幹部對外說話空頭牌子了！事實上，你們根本沒有實行過半點，所以我不忍說它，也不必說它了！</p>
<p>蘇皖邊區郵票　（王寒鷗寄）</p>
<p>再從黨務說起吧　老子天下第一　今兒天氣哈哈</p>
<p>對內「堅定信念」，對外「打通思想」，這是你領導的中國共產黨，對黨內對黨外的工作巾心，負擔這個巾心工作的高級幹部，都是從具有工作能力的「才」，與絕對不自私的「德」，以及入黨時間長短的「資」中選拔出來的，這在辦法上不能說不周到，但在效果上，便生出許多間題來，各級黨員「堅定信念」的結果，大多是犯了「老子天下第一」的毛病，而「打通思想」的終局，差不多百分之百的變成了「今兒天氣哈哈」的門面話，因爲黨內人的言行已經百分之百的老子天下第一化，所以黨外人也只有識相點，大家都不的而同的說「你頂好」與「他不行」，大家在笑哈哈的形勢下，便圓滿的完成了這偉大的歷史任務，至於「才德資」的標準，事實上應該說是「資格第一，才德次之，」因爲我親眼看到，參加過長征的老幹部，也就是從江西移到陝西的人們，現在都是了不起的人物，他們與她們是不是都具備了「才」與「德」的條件，請你看以下的鐵般事實。</p>
<p>舉幾個典型例子　長征時期幹部　最精彩的談話</p>
<p>華中軍部有位楊先生，他是參加長征的老幹部，他曾先後二次的對我說，他有個親弟弟，已過繼給他三個叔父，即俗謂「三房一子」，在抗戰中，他這位弟弟在正陽關當縣長，楊先生最精彩的語錄是這樣，「媽個皮的，他幹國民黨，我幹共產黨，那天我拿棵短槍，我非他媽的槍斃他不可，他在前邊跑，我在後邊追，一口氣追了十幾里地，他媽的這個狗一的，跳了河了，我他媽的不會水，要不，那天我一定幹掉他……」，這段事實，算是對黨內「堅定信念」的一個典型例子。</p>
<p>華中新聞專科學校，主持人是現在南京中共代表團中的范長江先生，爲了打通全體學生的思想，在學生生活檢討會上，由校方出了一個「什麼是人民報紙」的題目，交給學生生活檢討會來檢討，整整檢討了一個星期，這說明了有好多學生思想還沒有打通，因有不同的意見提出來，在這一　不決再來一週或二週的當兒，有幾個從前我敎過的學生，　我住的地方來談天，知道他們變個人，都是提出不同意見的有力者，當時我對他們說「這又何必呢，好漢不吃眼前虧，只要你們會說一句「頂好」與「不行」，任何問題不是都可以解決了嗎」！過了二天他們又來了，「什麽是人民報紙」的正確結論也通過了，這個偉大的歷史文獻，它與佈滿「解放區」各城墻上在你數丈互像旁邊那行「中國人民領袖毛澤東」紅色大字一樣，原文是「只有共產黨的報紙才是人民報紙」，這段事實，算是你們對黨外人「打通思想」的一個典型例子。</p>
<p>現在華中軍部幹特種工作的張團長，出身是太湖中的綠林好漢，爲了表現個人對黨的「德」，已將全部田地獻出，但在另一方面，開了二家老百姓不許造，張團長大量造的高糧酒廠，另外又買了幾條船與房子，我親眼看到他有二個太太，公館裏經常是大烟槍明列，勤務員成行，說起話來，老子天下第一的神氣，比較常年長腿將軍張宗昌，似乎有過之而無不及，這段事實，算是共產黨員「才」與「德」的一個典型例子。</p>
<p>再從政治說起</p>
<p>一位美國上校　不及共黨聰明</p>
<p>爲了說明你們兩面政治的情形，先舉出一件事實來做「新民主主義」其外，「共產主義」其內的根據，事情是這樣的：　今年春天，華中軍區政治委員譚震林先生，在一個代表大會上說，「執行小組美國A上校對我說，你們各種揹旅都很好，就是有一樣我不同意，你們現在實行的是「新民主主義，是减租减消主義，並不是共產主義，你們是以農民爲對象的，你們應該改名爲農民然，或者是農工黨與社會黨以及前進黨等，你們爲什麽一定要呌人家聽着害怕的共產黨呢？」，譚先生話甫說完，全體代表便不的而同的哄堂大笑一陣，這時譚先生以及台上好多位高級幹部，也都在笑口大開，從這個大家齊歡笑的中間，便很明白的指出來，這位美國上校，不及你們聰明，你們的兩而政治，他只能看到一面，自然中國的一般老百姓，也許連一面也看不到，所以「新民主主義」的「减租减息」，竟成了「共產主義」的「沒收家私」了！好漢做事好漢當，我是比較贊同的，你們現在覺得「淸算」與「鬥爭」有些太麻煩了，不如乾脆來一個「獻田」，實際上就是「分田」，共產黨講，共產在理諭上是應該的，伹在中國的現實環境上是不是允許呢？共產黨的政治工作幹部，是不是具備了黨員應有的條件呢？中國農村的老百姓們，是不是樂予接受呢？已經經過「算賬」與「鬥爭」以及「獻田」的「解放區」，在一切都返回原始狀態下，這在二十世紀的國際間，是不是可以自由生存呢？這些現實問題，可於下列的幾件事實解答之，同時也請你有以解答之。</p>
<p>舉幾個典型例子　抱着佃戶的腰　硬要他「翻身」</p>
<p>先談談「減租」與「獻田」呢，二五减粗，大都是從民國二十五年算起，我親眼看見你的幹部硬抱着佃戶們的腰，命令他們非「翻身」不可，如是佃戶全家排起隊來，前而由助威者鳴鑼擊鼓，後面由混飯者抬着竹筐，在高喊「共產黨萬歲」的聲中，地主席便被抬到「鎭政府」了，十年二五减租的淸算結果，就是把田地全數賣掉，也不足退還十年二五减狙的費用，最後只有說好話，把全部田地「獻出」完事，這是今年夏季以前老辦法，到了夏季以後，乾脆把二而政治的一面，就是「新民主主義」這一面，也就是「二五减租」這一面，來個不聲不響「收拾起」，餘下的這一面，雖也有「耕者有其田」的說法，但是實際上已經澈底的實行了共產主義的「分田」。</p>
<p>你們「解放區」經過了一分田」後的情形怎麽麼樣？也許你得到的報吿一定是「很好」二個字？但在我的眼中，却有好多嚴重問題存在着，只要你不與你許多幹部，不，應該說普遍幹部，做同樣「革命是克服一切困難的，因爲有了困難，所以才需要革命，只要你是膩革命者，只要你是一個不斷的革命者，不　失敗興死亡都是成功的。」「老子天下第一」的想法，那末這個鐵般事實，便不能不加以注意，事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>你們「分田」的辦法，是以鄉村爲單位的，不是這個鄉村有多少人，共有多少地，把人口數與土地數加起來，而後來一個「計口分田」，按每個鄕村的一般情形，大都是富農最少，貧農次之，中農佔最多數，比如說一個有二十畝田的中農，他有五口之家，依照這個鄕村的共有田數，每人可分三畝，一家五口，只能分得十五畝田，餘下五畝田，便被所謂貧農給白白的拿了去，你想想看，這個在鄕村具有絕對生產力的自耕農，從此他是不是要怠工，而昨日賣田胡鬧，今日又白白　回的鄕混子，也就是你們所說的「二流子」，由於不會生產，所以才家產賣畫，如今又得到外快了，又與長年流血流汗的自耕農一樣了，也就是說昨天他拿賣田錢狂嫖濫賭，到今天錢還沒有化光，而賣出的田又飛了回來，最妙的是這種壞傢伙，大都被你的幹部派做鄕村裏的什麽長與什麽員，他在名利雙收的新形勢下，便雙手握住富農的　子，兩腿騎在中農的肩上，也以革命者的姿態，橫行農村了，如是中農富農都在偸偸摸摸的殺耕牛了，毁農具了，拆水車與大車了，在農村本來就感到農具的不足，現在雖然還沒有到完全弄光的地步，但至少是越發減少了，請問毛先生，你們在呌的「大生產運動」，不知道將拿什麽來遝動呢？</p>
<p>「門爭」的真面目</p>
<p>「反奸門爭」中　連續演五幕戲</p>
<p>現在再談談「有錢皆壞蛋，無錢盡好人」的「鬥爭」吧，你們的「蘇皖邊區政府」的「劉副主席」在一個大會上這樣說過，「在農村用算賬來達到基本羣衆翻身的目的，在都市用反奸，反惡覇來達到基本羣衆反封建的目的……」，這段說話，是在你們對外大講「新民主主義」時期，所以用基本羣衆四字，來代表「無產階級」的名詞，現在你們在農村是澈底的「土地革命」了，在都市自然也得來澈底的反封建一番了！以下的事實，雖然是「明日黃花」，似乎仍可以做你們澈底施政的參考，事情是這樣的：</p>
<p>在淮陰中街有個開茶食店的許久成，家裏有一個七十多歲的母親，還有一個妻子與一個女兒，另外還有二個伙計，在敵偽時期，有個「二皇」營長，强存在許家店房裏六個箱箱子，到了你們「解放」了淮陰以後，這位「二皇」營長被俘了，六個箱子也被你的新四軍團長派人給抬了去，這是去年深秋的事，到了今年春天，都市的反封建「鬥爭」開始了，如是有幾位混吃喝的基本羣衆，看到許久成有一處房子，又有一個茶食店，便在他身上轉「鬥爭」的念頭了，幾個壞蛋一說，鬥爭委員一聽，案子便算成立了，如是許久成門口，便來了一大羣鳴鑼擊鼓的基本羣衆，在鑼鼓一住開了腔的唱詞裏，主要的有這麽二句，「許久成是漢奸，快把六個箱子交出來」，也許是許久成命不該絕吧？你們新四軍團長派人抬箱子時，有一個領路的茶房，與許久成相識的，經過一再的求，道位江北旅館的茶房終於傳到了，這位茶房先生頗有正義感，他當塲說明新四軍團長住在他的店的情形，以及派人抬去六個箱子的經過，也不但願意口頭作證，他更願意書面作證，至此一羣轉念頭的基本羣衆都相顧的啞言了，這時候你的「指導員」，在宣吿許久成無罪聲中，結束了「反奸鬥爭」的第一冪戲。</p>
<p>接着第二幕戲又開塲了，時間是當天的晚上，二個基木羣衆到了許家，七說八講後，硬拿了許久成三百元「抗幣」，（按當時豬肉價四元一斤，可買七十至八十斤），在管保無事聲巾，第二冪戲又算唱完了。　第二天第三幕戲又開塲了，許久成又被傳到「鎭政府」里去，你的「指導員」開頭的唱詞是「江北旅館茶房是你化錢收羅的，現在你只有寫「悔過書，認罰款才能完事……」，接着已經寫好的「悔過書」許久成便蓋上指印了，三千元「抗幣」的罰款單也加上指紋了，在七天必須送到聲中，第三幕戲又吿閉幕了！</p>
<p>第四幕戲的目錄是「許家夫婦兩逃亡」，許久成爲了不願拿出，事實上也無法拿出三千元罰款，所以在七日前，他便忍痛拋家棄業的逃走了，七日期屆，許太太便被傳到「鎭政府」去，你的「指導員」又說白了，「……七天已過，許久成偸跑，現在罰款加倍，在三天內必須交來六千元，不然你的財產就要沒收了……」，在是是是聲中，許太太也連夜步了她丈夫的老道，拋家棄業逃走了！</p>
<p>第五幕戲爲了跑了二個男女主角，我在明知「不可爲而爲之」的情形下，也自動的參加扮演了，情節是這樣的：</p>
<p>第三天的下午，「鎭政府」派遺八條瘦漢，你言我語的駕臨許家，一面登記一切什物，一面高聲對許老太太說「什麼也不許動，明天就沒收你的全部家產啦」，由於一個商人朋友的說明，在八條瘦漢行將去兮的同時，我便親來許家了！從許老太太與商人朋友以及二個鄰人的口中，知道事情始末的眞實性，當即自吿奮勇，立即走訪「鎭政府」負責「鬥爭」的「指導員」我在表明雙料顧阿身份後，有這樣一段說話，「……如果許久成應該死，那你們第一次就把他槍斃好了，爲什麼第一次宣吿無罪，第二次詐去三百元，第三次又有罪了，罰款三千元，第四次又加倍了，罰款六千元，第五次又沒收全部財產了，我是北方人，說句北方的俗話吧。你們到底還有完沒有完呢？」。最後由「鎭政府」轉到「區政府」，總算托天之幸，不了了之了，但是許久成夫婦，在我離開進陰的時候，仍然是做客他鄉哩。</p>

<p>「逼上梁山」新頁</p>
<p>當票一槪作廢　憑「良心」贖物</p>
<p>再說一個「不憑當票憑良心」的「鬥爭」故事吧，在淮陰開過當舖的李玉書，被你的幹部開過所謂「公審會」判決了無期徒刑，過了幾天你的民運幹部便分保召開一個「約求李玉書賠償損失」的集會，也就是「不憑當票憑良心」的會，你的「指導員」說法是這樣的「……李玉書放火燒當舖，現在政府本羣衆的意思，巳經判他無期徒刑，全部財產沒收，政府爲顧到你們當去東西的損失，你們可以提出來，只要大家憑良心，沒有當票不要緊，由我蓋章證明是一樣的……」，如是從來沒有穿過皮襖的硬說當過皮襖，從來沒有穿過絲織品的也硬說當過綢褲，一個長年唸佛的七旬餘老太太，也就是對我說明道件故事的老太太，她不願意取得這筆喪良心財，當她回答我沒有當過什麼東西的同時，保長在暗地里撞她一下，低聲的說「你就隨便寫點吧」，終於保長在隨便寫點了，但這位老太太對我發誓的說，這種不義之財，無論如何她是不肯要的，然而報上去，領下來的調調兒，究竟是爲誰辛苦爲誰忙呢？</p>
<p>最後再說一件政治騙局的故事吧，你們駐在南京上海的通絡人員，爲了表現成績，爲了領取經費，他們與她們便經常把小册子，報紙，雜誌，以及理論岡書等，向已經發生連絡關係的準備革命者，也就是「聽見人家說」者，不斷的分發，並不時的誇說「解放區」怎樣怎樣的好，歡迎「解放區」以外的人到那里去觀光，求學，就業，我們管接管送管吃管住，如果願意留下來求學就業的話，計求學校方供給衣食住與書籍，就業有優厚薪金，願意回來，我們便負責送回來等語，如是有好多人們，尤其是靑年人們，在「求眞理」與「申正義」的情緒下，便被押解到「解放區」了，爲了說明「押解」代表「歡迎」的眞實性，特舉二例以證之。</p>
<p>有十個從前我敎過的學生，現工作在和平日報，今年六月間，　與其他三個人，一同被歡迎到「解放區」里來，不知道爲了什　，這個學生的思想同我一採，始終沒有打通，當他快心「打道回京」的前夜，不管怎麽說，不但不管送，連路單也不發給，第二天我正想找個高級幹部　　理去，另一個學生來告訴我，這位同學在天邊未亮時，就空手登程了，至於他是不是能走出「解放區」去，到現在仍沒得着下文。</p>
<p>還有一位同學，被歡迎到淮陰後，派在「蘇皖邊區政府公安總局工作，爲了過不下去每天吃公糧，穿公衣，睡私覺長日無事的生活，也動「打道回府」之念，經過一再請假不准，這位同學便高掛公服，平陳印信，來個你不送，我硬走的辦法，結果行到寳應，便被押解回來，一言不問，就關了二個多月，後來他的太太也來了，這才還了自由，不過附帶一個條件，就是他們夫妻倆，不能够遠離淮陰的，現在淮陰是改觀了，不知道這一對被「逼上梁山」的夫妻，如今又流落何地了！</p>
<p>政府代表劉永芳，美方代表佛勞倫斯，與中共代表王少　合影（本報特派員　　之攝於王少　自徐州飛返臨沂之際）</p>
<p>再從經濟說起　一切爲老百姓　這話不符事實</p>
<p>你們的經濟理論，我不想說它，事實上也不需要說它·一年來我從多方面觀察，你們眞實經濟政策，的有下列的二類：</p>
<p>一，黨取之於民的經濟</p>
<p>二，黨分之於商的經濟</p>
<p>先談談黨取之於民的經濟吧，你們從老百姓身上取得的經濟，約有以下四種：</p>
<p>（一）征收公糧</p>
<p>（二）發行紙幣</p>
<p>（三）征收物稅</p>
<p>（四）沒收財產</p>
<p>以上四項經濟措施，照你們的說法，是「一切都爲老百姓，共產黨員從來是不要一個錢的」。</p>
<p>共產黨員在目前，較大貪汚者少，這是事實，這是不是由於現階段貧困的經濟環境所造成，雖然不能肯定，但是小貪汚者舉目皆是，却是鐵般事實，將來和平實現，經濟環境改觀，這種舉目皆是的小貪汚，它是不是會變大，或者會變小，我想這個問題任何人都會下結論的。</p>
<p>也許這樣說法，我有些太主觀了吧？我覺得「一切都爲老百姓」的說法，應該改爲「一切都爲共產黨」，而「共產黨員從來不要一個錢的」，也應該改爲「共產黨員從來不丟一個錢的」，這樣才能算是名實一致，不知道毛先生尊意云何了！</p>
<p>舉些典型例子吧　「公審大會」上　「門爭」達高潮</p>
<p>去年冬天，你們的「蘇皖邊區政府劉瑞龍副主席」，他是負責「蘇皖邊區」內一切「鬥爭」的巾心人物，在一次規模最大最熱鬧的所謂「公審大會上，（按「公審大會」加上「所謂」二字者，並不是原則上我不同意，我是覺得在事前你們已經私審完了，計常場槍斃，沒收財產，而後故意的再來一遍，詳見拙著見聞詩歌的公審會，）劉副主席的雄姿與偉論是這樣的：</p>
<p>他站在已經動員好的基本羣衆中間的一個方掉上，一隻手拿着紙烟，一隻手高舉過頂，便破口在呌的說，「今天吶！是你們老百姓翻身日子到啦，周公望（即當塲被槍斃者）每畝田向你們强征二十五斤，逼得你們都活不了啦，今天是你們淸算血債的時候到了，你們有寃的伸冤，有仇的報仇……」，接着便有一位事前安排好的老太婆，走到周公望面前，從懷里摸出個黑色餅子來，向周公望口里一面送一面說：「……你一畝田要俺二十五斤，逼的俺吃這個東西中了病，一你的娘，你也給俺吃，　你也給俺吃……」，這一幕算是那天「公審大會」的最高潮，也是你們對外宣傳最起勁的地方，現在每畝田征收二十五斤的周公望，被你們槍斃快要一年了，這位吃黑麵餅子而中病的老太婆，如今又不知流浪何方了，拿人類應有的最低良心來說，共產黨「征收公糧」，無論如何每畝田的征收數目，總應該在二十五斤以下才對，但是出人意料的事情，終於擺在眼前了，你的幹部在寳應，高郵，興化等地區，每畝田「征收公糧」的數目是三十斤以上，另外每畝田還征收草十數斤，請間毛先生，這種幹法，又應該怎樣解釋呢？</p>
<p>再談談「發行紙幣」吧，「蘇皖邊區」最後的統一紙幣，是「華中銀行」發行的，它對老百姓的眞實關係，約有以下的二項：</p>
<p>一·吸收老百姓的農產品</p>
<p>二·吸收老百姓的金屬品</p>
<p>你的經濟幹部吸收老百姓農產品的方法與步驟是這樣的，第一步是禁止老百姓農產品出口，第二步是規定比「解放區」外低的價格收買，第三步是通過特種商人，運往「解放區」外，換取你們需要的物資，從這個「吸收三部曲上看，便淸淸楚楚的指出來，我這「一切都爲共產黨」的說法，並不是信口開河的。　你的經濟幹部，「吸收老百姓的金屬品」的方法與步驟是這樣的；第一步規定比「解放區」外的小三分之一以上的價格，隨時隨地收買，第二步凡私相買賣者，就是現洋一塊，也難逃沒收的命運，第三步同吸收農產品的第三步一樣，自然結論也不會兩樣了。</p>

<h3>「太貴了」</h3>
<p>— L．托爾斯泰作　高非譯</p>
<p>「太貴了」原是法莫泊桑的一篇小說。托爾斯泰重用了它的故事，寫出一個黑附的國度裘，用如何愚笨的方法來處置一個犯人。—譯者</p>
<p>靠近法蘭西和意大利的邊境，在地中海的濱岸上，有一個小如彈丸的王國呌做摩諾哥。許多小鄉鎭也會驕傲着比這個王國有更多的居民。因爲在這里一共只有七千多人，而且，假如把這個小王國的土地平均分配的話，一個居民分不到一畝薄田。然而在這個王國表，却有一個正統的小皇帝，他也有大厦，侍廷，朝臣和主敎，也有將軍和軍隊。</p>
<p>那並不是一支龐大的隊伍，總共才有六十個人，但它仍然是一支隊伍。在這個王國裏也有稅收，像烟稅，酒稅和烈酒稅人頭稅都是。雖然這裏的人民也像其他國家的人民一樣地喝酒和吸烟，似如國王不能找到他種新奇的特別的稅源，他也很難使這麼少的臣民來養活他的朝臣官員和他自己。這項特別的收入來自人們玩着輪盤賭的賭塲裏。賭客們賭博看，不管怎麽，官員經常地在輸贏反轉上抽出百分之幾的稅來，那麽在他的全部贏錢之中，必要送給國上一大筆錢。人們所以要負担重稅的理由便是在歐州的賭塲只有這個了。以前呢，也有德國的幾個地方政府常去保留這種賭塲，但在幾年以前，就被禁止了。禁賭的理由是因爲這些賭塲足以招惹那麼多的損害。一個人可以試試他的運氣，他會竭盡所有孤注一擲地賭博着，輸去他所有的錢。接着他也會拿着並不屬於他自己的錢賭博，結果又是輸個乾凈。最後在失望之中，他會投水或自刎而死的。所以德國人禁治他們的統治者用這種方法掙錢。但是在這裏沒有人去禁止摩諾哥國王，而且他是專有了這個事業的。</p>
<p>所以每個想賭博的人都去到摩諾哥，不管他們輸盈與否，國王都能從巾取利。俗話說：「人無橫財不富。」摩諾哥國王知道這是一種卑汚的事業，但是他還能做些甚麼呢？他已經活着了，而且徵收酒稅和酒稅也並不是一件多漂亮的事呵。所以他仍要活下去，統治着，搜括着銀錢，而且也用着和眞正皇帝一樣的禮儀去臨朝聽政。</p>
<p>他有加冕禮，早朝，有賞，有罰，有赦，而且他也有檢閱，議會，法律和法院，正像其他的國上一樣，只不過是小些而已。</p>
<p>這作事情發生於不多年前，這個王國裏有個殺人犯被捕入獄了。這裏的人民原來都是酷愛和平的，這事情從來就沒有發生過。法官們都嚴肅地集合起來，用最合法的態度來討論這個案子。有審判官，檢察官，陪審官和律師。他們辯論着，商談着，結果他們判決他理應依法砍頭。就這樣罷。他們把判決文書呈給國王，國王唸了判詞，用筆批着：「如該犯必須處死，即執行無誤。一</p>
<p>這件事情却有一個困難，就是他們既沒有一座斷頭台去割下犯人的頭，又沒有一個劊子手。大臣們考慮着這件事情，而且決定向　國政府去一封公函，詢問法國　　借給他們一架機器和一位專家來殺死犯人，假如能够的話，就請法國政府照實　覆他們需錢多少好啦。公函送了出去，一星期後覆文就送來了，說是機器和專家都可以供給的，全部需用只要一萬六千法郞，覆文放在國王面前，他攷慮着：一萬六千法郞！「那個可憐虫也不値這多錢，」他說∶「有甚麽方法可使它便宜些呢？呃！一萬六千法郞，比全國人每人攤出兩法郞的總數還多呢？人民他許不願負担了，說不定要會惹起一塲　動哩。一</p>
<p>因此，召集了一個會議來討論這事應怎樣辦，結果決定照樣送給意大利國王一封公函。法國是共和政體根本沒有對於國王的尊敬，但是意王是位誼如手足的君主，他可能被懇請得較爲便宜些的。於是公函便立刻寫好，而且很快地又接到覆文了。</p>
<p>意政府寫着，他們很樂意供給機器和專家的，全部價格只要一萬二千法郞，而且連運費在內。這自然是比較便宜些了。但是仍嫌貴些。那壞蛋眞也不値這筆錢的。那仍要每個人担負將近兩法郞的重稅。議會又召集了，他們討論着，思攷着如何能用較少的費用了結這事。難道沒有一個兵士能用粗糙的簡便的法子結果他嗎？將軍們被召來了，他們被問着：「你不能替我們找來一個能够殺人的兵士嗎？在戰爭中，他們是殺人不眨眼的。事實上，這便是要訓練他們的目的。」將軍向士兵們反覆地攷問着，看看是誰能執行這事，但是竟沒有一個兵士能够完成使命的。「不，」他們說：「我們不知道如何執行，這並不是已經敎給我們的事呵！」</p>
<p>怎麼辦呢？大臣們思慮又思慮。他們召集了一個委員會，一個特種委員會和一個小委員會，最後他們決定最好的方法是更改死刑爲無期徒刑，這樣不但使國王能够表示他的寬大爲懷，而且也要便宜些的。</p>
<p>國王也同意了，事情就是如此處理罷。只是還有一個困難，就是這裏沒有一個可供監禁無期徒刑的牢獄。有一座小拘留所，那只是暫時關閉人們用的，但是沒有一所宜於久用的堅固的監獄。不管怎樣，後來總算找到一個可以對付的地方。他們把年靑的犯人關在裏面，又設了一個衛兵看管着他。衛兵當然要監視犯人，而且要從宮廚裏替他取食物。</p>
<p>犯人關在牢裏，一月又一月，一整年就過去了。但是當舊年過後，一天小國王査算他的收支時，注意到一項支出，那就是爲了禁閉犯人的耗費。那並不是一筆小賬，特別用一個衛兵和犯人的飲食，一年就要六百多法郞。最糟糕的是犯人依然很年靑而且很健康，他足可活到五十歲的。如果合計一下，數目便很驚人了。永不能如此做的，所以國王召集了大臣們，說道：</p>
<p>「關於這個流氓，你們必須找出較便宜的方法。現在的處置未免太浪費了。」大臣們聚在一起，考慮再三，後來有一個說：「大人們，依我之見，我們必須撤去衛兵。」「可是」又一個接住說：「犯人就會跑走的。」「對的。」第一個發言人又說：「讓他跑走，滾他媽的蛋！」因此他們把決議呈給國王，他也同意了。衛兵一經撤去，他們等着將要發生的一幕。然而所發生的却是在　　　間，犯人走了出來，他並不尋找衛兵，一直去到宮廚中領　他自己的午餐。他只取出自由　一份，轉回獄中，關上牢門，　在屋裏。第二天又是如此：在適當的時間，他拿取自己的一份食物。至於說偸跑呢？他沒有顯露出絲毫跡象。怎麼辦呢？他們又思索着這樁事情了。</p>
<p>「我們就直接吿訴他吧！」他們說：「我們不願再監禁他了。」</p>
<p>所以司法大臣就把犯人召來。</p>
<p>「爲什麼你不跑走呢？」大臣問：「並沒有衛兵看管你啊！如今你能去到任何你願去的地方，國王也不追究的。」</p>
<p>「我也說國王不再追究的。」犯人說：「但是我是連個去處都沒有，我能再做些甚麼呢？你們已經用判罪毁減了我的人格，人們都要遺棄我的，而且我已經失業了。你們錯待了我，那並不漂亮呵。首先你們旣經判我死刑，你們就該執行，但是你們並沒有，你是一件事情，我並沒有抱怨。後來你們把我判爲無期徒刑，而且叫衛兵替我領取食物，但是過了一些時候，你們把他支開，我只得拿取我自己的食物了，我也不抱怨。現在你們要我走開，我不能同意還事。願怎麼你們就怎麽好了，但是我是決不走開的。」怎麼辦呢？會議又召集了，他們能採用甚麽辦法呢？犯人是決不走開的。他們想了再想，要他走開的惟一方法只有給他一筆贍養費，所以他們就禀告給國王了。「對於這，再沒有其他的辦法了。」他們說：「不管怎樣，我們必頭叫他走開。」那筆款子決定是六百法郞而且通知了犯人。「好的」，他說：「我決不在乎，只要你們按期給付就是了。在這個條件上，我還願意走出去。」</p>
<p>這件事情便如此辦理了。犯人領到刊支的贍養費的三分之一就離開了這塊王土，坐火車只要十五分鐘他就會出境了。他定居在鄰國的邊境，在那裏他買了一些田地，開闢了一方菜園，現在已生活得很舒適了。他常常按時去領取他的贍養費。領出現款後，他去到賭攤上，擲上三兩個法郞作賭，有時贏了，有時輸了，他就走了回去。他生活得眞平和舒服呵。</p>
<p>真算幸事：他虧得沒有在一個不肯吝嗇於買購殺人機的國家裏，也沒有在那個能够監禁終生的國家裏觸犯了這樣的罪名。</p>

<h3>雪泥畫展</h3>
<p>— 俞華劍</p>
<p>雪泥孫鴻海上老畫友也。以經理某美術公司名於時，雖置身　　之中，而放情於山林之外；點染雲烟，涉筆成趣。顧以事繁不暇多作，近忽發豪興，竭兩月之力寫成兩百幅，山水與梅竹各半，公展於中國畫苑。所作山水有石谿之骨格，兼新羅之秀逸，雖草草若不經意，而能備六法於意象之外，蕭疏澹遠，如不食人間烟火；以之與駭紅艷綠者相較，雅俗何祗天淵。梅花則枝多於花，鐵骨冰心，挺之於風雪之巾，其不屈不撓冷而戀芳之精神，活躍紙上。允喜作枯株老樹，侖囷槎枒，極曲折古樸之致，塲中並陳列鄭梅淸君所蓄盆景古松十餘盆，其大逾恒，其粗逾拱，根如羣峰並立，幹如龍蛇飛舞，葉如聚蓋高張，枝如蟹爪橫行；或倒掛而下，如神龍之探海；或偃蹇而上，如鸞鳳之翔空。四圍配以界泥之山水，恍如置身於蓮花天都之間，而忘其在一室中也。鄭君云家中所蓄至數百盆，余素喜寫松，聞之色喜，異日有暇，當造府爲老龍鱗寫寫照也。</p>
<h3>鄕村的黃昏</h3>
<p>— Dale　Nichols</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　87</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我們在牆外，拿出手槍，以備萬一；待了不到十分鐘，果然聽到一種　　嚀嚀的聲音，好像有人穿着，軟底鞋，走在沙子上面一樣，但仔細一聽，聲音又沒有了。我們剛在聚會精神，側着耳朶的當口，驀然聽得像悶雷似的「嗡」，一聲狗呌，就在我們頭頂吠着一般。一聽就知道這是蒙古的巨獒。這畜生吠聲來了，同時就用脚爪在石　上抓爬着。像蒙古五獒那種身量，兩隻後脚站了起來，兩隻前爪就可搭上牆頭。牠在石牆上抓爬，定是有人牽住了牠，不能儘量把身體伸直。所奇怪的，直到現在並不聽見人的步聲，和其他動靜。</p>
<p>在這緊急當口。我同虎弟，只把身體緊緊貼在牆上，控制着呼吸，不敢動憚，聽覺視覺集中在　頭上。這時祇要人頭或狗頭冒出了牆頭，我們就得動手。</p>
<p>誰知我們屏息守候了一會，並無動靜，我剛有些煩躁，想示意虎弟，向北　動、虎弟却已打着手式，呌我警戒着，他　越過我的身邊，沒着　根朝北襲了過去，又輕又捷。不到兩丈遠近，見他似乎把槍仍舊擎在腰裏，兩手向牆頭一搭，把身體吊了上去，頭部漸漸冒過　頭，先朝我這頭瞧了瞧，又朝北瞧了瞧，一鬆手落下地來。</p>
<p>「走了！」虎弟跑過來，指着南頭，一是一個鬼子，牽的一匹獒。」</p>
<p>靜候了一會，的莫那傢伙去得遠了，虎弟上牆，給了安全暗號，我們重新又翻到牆內，沿着叢林北走。虎弟領頭哨探，離我約有十幾步遠近。走了不到卞碼，猛然驚覺，聽得我身後來了一陣咻咻聲息。本能地「咦」了一聲，我回頭一瞧，只見一隻小牛般的巨獒，向我這裏衝了過來，巨　後面還跟着一個人，像鬼影子似的，跑得極快，却不聽見脚步聲。</p>
<p>「站住！」我輕輕喝了一聲。危險臨頭，我反覺得頭腦冷靜起來。這時縱令鑽進叢林，也無益處，因狗鑽起來更快。要想越牆，又隔一丈多遠，狗也可以追蹤，况且那鬼子身邊未必無槍。我這時左手已經揚起手槍，將敵人罩住，右手握着小劍。因恐　動其他倭軍，暫時忍住，沒有放槍，祇輕輕一喝，打算先將敵人鎭住。</p>
<p>我剛喝了這一聲「站住」，猛不防地一注强光迎面射了過來，逼住了我的眼睛。這時要放槍，也來不及了。</p>
<p>「嘿，好小子！」那傢伙說得一口好關外口音；離開我一丈遠近，勒住了狗，一齊站住。</p>
<p>這傎正千鈞一髪的當口，我蓄着勢猛地向大路上一躍，脫出了那傢伙電筒的光圈，隨又回身一傴僂，向叢林裏一鑽。正在這時候，忽然聽得那發話的傢伙，發了一聲慘號，那手電筒的光，立時不見，同時只聽得卜通一響，好像一袋高粱落在地上一般。我鑽進叢林，剛被兩棵組壯冬靑桿子夾住，聽得這種聲響，扭回頭一瞧，眼睛被剛才那陣强光照過，還在泛花，却勉强還能看見一丈不到的大路上，一個細長的影子，東一閃，西一躍，正同那隻巨獒游鬥着。那隻巨獒一面發着威咆哮着，一面東一掠，西一撲地，像一隻猛虎一般向那細條個子搏噬。我定睛細看，才瞧出果然是虎弟在跟那巨熬搏鬥。那牽狗的鬼子，却倒在地上，像一堆什麼東西。</p>
<p>我見了這種情形，立時退出叢林，仍舊一手小劍，一手握槍，向前進迫。虎弟一見，一面鬥着狗，一面悄聲喝道，「小姨快別上來，噍我揍這狗！」我只能煞住脚步，略略逼進，仍想乘機參加戰鬥。只見虎弟同那狗左右閃跳了兩下，那狗猛地向上一躍，向前一撲，看看快要落到虎弟身上，只見虎弟，向後撤了一步，左臂一摚，左手就是一掌，拍地一響，正打在那狗的耳朶上，那麽大一條巨獒，經這一掌，一歪身，嗥了一聲，就躺下了。</p>
<h3>文化界的友誼</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>前次在世界社，歡送李書華出席聯合國文化科學敎育會，他說這會有五十多國代表參加，大都是學術敎育界有名的人士，所以商談的態度，都很誠懇，不比政治性的會議，奸僞狡猾。所以我也覺得文化學術界人士，率眞忠實，有同情心與正義感，雖討論政治，目的在挽救人類，而非爭權奪利，毫無功利思想，與陷害別人的野心。聯合國文化科學敎育會，將來也許有可能將世界聯合起來！</p>
<p>我們在上海發起香雪園文藝茶座，另外又恢復文藝茶話會，完全是聯誼性質，沒有主席，沒有人操縱，自由自在，無拘無束，也就是因爲沒有政治爭鬥，纔可以談到友誼團結，共同商量國家興隆與文化建設問題，再推廣到人類博愛上，謀世界的和平與安寗：這些責任，只有文化學術界的人士，可以担負起來！</p>
<p>忠實的友誼，在聯合國文化科學敎育會中，也許可能看見一點兒光明！現在我們在上海，想呼吸一點自由空氣，所以有香雪園的『文藝茶座』與大新公司五層樓酒家的『文藝茶話會』，大家可以安心說自己要說的眞話，用不到那一套虛僞狡猾的政治手腕！以友情爲出發點，以文化學術爲最高目標，這樣世界和平，纔可以實現！人類改革，纔能有幸福的希望！</p>
<p>文藝界朋友們！你們沒有政治野心的，可以大家携手起來，來，我們來一起走向光明之路！</p>

<h3>昏燈碎語</h3>

<p>周佛海死</p>
<p>周佛海判處死刑了。審判長宣判之後，曾說：「你不服，你可上訴最高法院，最高當局，他們可以减你的刑的。」在就道還押前，本報記者問他有何感覺，他說：「這是法官寬寬我的心的，我的死，已決定於戴局長雨農殉職之日，戴局長在，他可以替我擔戴的。」</p>
<p>人死無對證，祇好由他說了。不過假使眞有陰曹地府的話，看模樣周逆還準備去對戴局長算賬的。</p>
<p>據信託局地產處副經理說：截至目前止，里弄房屋迄無一人申請登記，誰也不是大傻瓜，誰願意來幹道傻事，花錢找氣受。</p>
<p>上海的地產交易，近來幾乎是一個死門，銀行旣不能抵押，把頭寸呆在一堆磚太泥土上，何苦？况且使用價値遠超過產權價値，有個幾千萬，放放拆息，利厚而又活動，爲什麽不這麼做呢？</p>
<p>還有一層，房地產買賣，市政府過戶納稅，要繳到百分之五十，還有其他七七八八的嚕囌，因之，假使出兩千萬元買房子，所要付出的怕就在三千萬以上，談不上便宜。</p>
<p>我們眞替信託局着急！</p>

<h3>法令如毛　行之維艱</h3>
<p>— 胡沂生</p>
<p>在硏究經濟的人看來，任何政策都須具備經濟的基礎，才是良好的政策，旣易推行，又易收效，反之則雖有巧思，也祇「弄巧成拙」沒有不失敗的。</p>
<p>勝利後的政府施策，就外表言：缺乏統一，各行其是，民疲於命，無怪要作法令如毛之嘆了。就實質言：則缺乏經濟的基礎，其例俯拾即是，最就近的如：</p>
<p>（一）社會部基於人道的見地計　廢止娼妓和人力車，用心良苦，可是試一設想廢止娼妓後娼妓之家將何以爲生？政府是否將介紹職業或代覓良人？廢止人力車後人力車夫及其家族生活何賴？設不使轉入正當職業則其後果有未計及？此等問題設不先事解決，徒倡人道口號而欲傚法華盛頓之解放黑人，宜乎人力車夫集團反對，徒增社會之騷擾了，我們應認淸：「失業的苦痛甚於一切，而失業又是萬惡的根源」；故先解決中國普通的失業，使全國國民各有生業，無一失業，然後再進一步去廢止娼妓和人力車。這才是具備經濟基礎的優良政策，必能獲得大衆的擁護。（二）最近全國實施徵兵，事屬當然可是其方法頗多研考之餘地，蓋中國靑平之地位與責任與世界先進國根本不同，世界先進國敎育費用全由國家負祖，即經大學畢業服務社會以後，其薪給也不遽賴以供養父母，但逐漸求自立而已，我國靑年則不然：一種是靑年全然依靠家庭，不事生業，徒爲社會之奇生虫。另一種則家庭全然依靠靑年，童年旣不予以充分就學之機會，一過十齡，便令習業，其學徒時代之所得也節的以供家用，開始有了家庭負担，加以結婚年齡過早，未達三十而兒女成羣，負祖奇重，以老以死。此種靑年實居中國靑年之大半，而遽被徵兵，未有不發生嚴重之問題者，當局對此不加硏討而遽行普通徵兵，於是由徵兵一變而爲志願兵，再變而爲買賣兵，此風一長，反足爲將來推行眞正兵役之障得，其利未見而流弊百出了。再就國家的立塲說，目下經濟建設時代，凡百庶政須以擴充生產力爲第一要義，至少也應維持現有之生產力，絕不能反使減弱，職業靑年問題間接直接爲裨益生產份子，故被徵不啻摧殘生產，我們每設想政府爲何不先移對象於游民及失業靑年之徵兵？此於任何觀點均屬有利。</p>
<p>但在這裏應加聲明的，我並非反對社會部的廢止娼妓及人力車，更非對徵兵國策獨唱異說，不過對政策的缺乏經濟基礎，願提出從長探討以期改善。</p>
<h3>最完善的　公共汽車</h3>
<p>— 達譯自Machinery　Magazine</p>
<p>劍橋大學電機系三年級生勞侖考斯，正在計劃一輛最現想的公共汽車，祇可容四十客。</p>
<p>最使坐客討厭的是引擎太煩囂，理想中的公共汽車却裝有隔音板。</p>
<p>如果外面的溫度太熱，突破百度大關，那末這輛公共汽車的溫度總在七十度左右，不會使你汗出如漿，或許外面的霧太濃，空氣太潮濕了，裏面的濕度是頂適宜的。</p>
<p>口渴了，裏面有沙濾水，或者威士忌也有，杯子是現成的，祇要你用手在龍頭上一捻，就够你受用了！</p>
<p>車廂的玻窗永遠晶潔，有防霜刷，拭雨刷，是電動的；所以你坐在車座，可以看外面的雪景</p>
<p>車胎是最新型的，內胎不實氣體，可免爆胎之虞。</p>
<p>有電動機四座，每座有七十五匹馬力。</p>
<p>當然不用汽油，可免火災，但爲萬一計，車廂裏有滅火設備，還有無綫電話裝設，以便坐客無聊。</p>
<p>假如恰巧內急，車廂裏有厕所。　　　這種公共汽車頂適宜於長途跋涉，英國的交通部因爲這種公共汽車太貴族化了，拒絕製造。而美國公路管理局已和他接洽，預備大量製造，以便石用。</p>
<p>聞第一批一百輛應行駛於美國寬敞的公路上矣。</p>
<p>上海瑣事</p>
<h3>郞中考試</h3>
<p>— 正</p>
<p>上海區中醫師考試已於本月一至三日在光華大學及中正中學兩處舉行，參加考試者近兩千人，試塲情形與其他考試頗有不同之處，筆者爰將所見，記述如下，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>在兩千人中，以年在三十歲以下，各中醫學院畢業生佔最多數，有敎授數人也來應考。年逾花甲的老醫生亦有多人。大都穿常服，少數頭戴瓜皮小帽，身穿藍袍黑褂，着西裝的不到百分之一。</p>
<p>第一天，規定須在六時三刻到達，因此天未明，見許多人力車，在四川路上，即三輪車·汽車向北奔馳。有許多自外埠趕來的，因到達過遲而不准與考。</p>
<p>因爲試塲座位不敷，大禮堂的第一考塲中醫和司法人員混合在一起，二三試塲在食堂裏，八人合坐一方桌，都感到座位不適，頗以爲苦。因此秩序很受影響，因傳閱考卷被法警扣考者曾有多起。</p>
<p>所考診斷學·方劑學·藥物學等科題目不十分困難，凡醫學有相當根底者都能應付。國文題目是「民族健康論」，也容易發揮。但選科題目較不易解答，允其是內科題最深奧，呌「亢則害，承迺制論。」大都不明其確切意義，所答也各不相同。更有人把「迺」字讀作「栖」或「棲」，令人棒腹。</p>
<p>憲法一科，大家都覺生疏，因此，在臨時考試前，還都手持醫學院印發的「訓政時期的法」閱讀。</p>
<p>女科題中，關於「血崩」的診治都不甚瞭解，在考試以後，男女之間都討論此問題，毫無顧忌。</p>
<p>最後一天下午口試，分成二十個試塲，主考官是上海的中醫考試委員，所考者也是有關診斷方劑藥物方面的問題。因此竟有十分之二放棄權利。有的應考者與主考官平時本是同一個醫學院的敎授，在試場裏裝作不相識。</p>
<p>據說，所有考卷都送到南京去批閱，規定錄取的名額很少，因此都感覺杌隉不安。</p>
<h3>交大瑣聞</h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>交大新同學宿舍將届竣工，哲生館亦煥然一新，各寢室與敎室之刷新工作亦將决第完成，像徵一片新興氣象。</p>
<p>交大有川籍同學一人，平日體質欠佳，然用功精神不懈，曾數獲優厚獎學金，最近因用功過度，忽咯血不止，同學急送紅十字醫院急救，病態仍甚嚴重，同學均甚痛惜，對其所得之將學金，咸稱之爲「獎血金」，蓋其爲「血的代價」也。</p>
<p>交大校內駐有大批寄生蟲，表面以服務爲目的，實則黑心牟利，諸如××服務處，××食堂等，均由商人承辦，不但水電房屋由校方供給，且可逃避營業稅，但其所售貨物價格則並不賤於一般市塲，有時反較高，同學時有怨言，紛紛相的，發起「拒購運動」。</p>
<p>重慶各校貼條子作買賣之風，已帶到上海，近日交大中上院走廊壁上，滿貼「廉讓」與「徵求」條子，其精采者更有「揮淚大廉讓」「捨命大拍賣」等，觀其交易物品，多爲冬天衣服，必修敎本，以及伙食團飯票等</p>
<p>交大功課，素極嚴格，過去每年至少淘汰五分之一，最近一次敎務會議席上，李敎務長熙謀曾稱，本校過去在渝時之算分法過於嚴格，今後可略放寬些，凡不及格學分超過三分之一者，亦允許參加補考。一般爲「三分之一」而憂之同學，聞之莫不喜形於色，如獲大赦令下。</p>
<h3>補白</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>張羣此次因患「胃痛症」赴美就醫，江西某縣報紙誤登爲「痔瘡」；雖同樣是病，却大有出入。這玩笑眞開大了！</p>
<h3>智慧測驗答案</h3>
<p>（按測騐題載昨日本刋）</p>
<p>任何一書均無五十三與五十四頁之間的地位，不巧當時凱德剛閱五十三頁之某段故事。而發覺其反面即五十四頁，其間並無足以放入鈔票之地位也，此亦爲日常容易忽略之事，未料布僕竟露出馬脚！</p>
<h3>週末茶話</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>週末的本身原是極富於誘惑感的，「禮拜六」這一名詞經常象徵着解脫，坦暢，舒適的一面。但是數月來蕭索的現實已使人對週末發生嚼橄欖的感覺，存在於人們心頭的往昔豪華，現在都已漸漸淡漠了。上星期的週末，我曾統計過平漢滬粤四地在一星期巾所發生的輕生目殺的事件，結果在總數二十六件當中發覺到有半數以上是迫於生活，而這許多被生活壓榨得走上絕路的又幾乎全是商界人物利公務員。公務員的經濟生活我們姑置不論，單就商業方面來說，舉幾個最現實的一週來上海市塲作例：萬國，鶴鳴等幾家大商店已瀕於閉歇；各烟草公司紛紛關門；高士滿，金魚飯店已改爲美貨商塲；以及蘭心戲院公演「夜半歌聲」的首塲祇售出四張門票之類；你別看他們「减價」「競銷」是一派繁榮氣象，眼見高利貸就要逼着他們成爲前者之續了。蘇曼殊所謂：「籠鷄有食湯刀近」。週末寫此，我不禁爲那些陶朱後裔也有大嚼橄欖的一日，感到莫名惆悵！</p>
<p>吸血者</p>
<p>報載無錫上月會槍決了一名土匪，事後竟有人在刑場上拿白饅頭數個，自得其樂地蘸着新鮮腦血，狼呑虎嚥一番。此公胃口旣令人驚異，天眞的程度也委實呌人嘆服。山國社會上本來就流傳着一種「見血辟邪，吃血長壽」的說法，想來此公必係貧病侵尋，又吃不到配售的奶粉，維他命之類，自悲生不逢辰之餘，幸遇此「棄之可惜」的良機，於是大啖其新鮮人血；一方面實行直接進補，他方面則想沾點血腥氣，也好挨身混入社會上那些腦滿腸肥的所謂上流階層裏面去，讓他們騐明「是我族類」，從此就可以大模大樣，公開吮吸他人身上的血液了。此公情固可憫，用心亦苦，不過聽說錫地輿論，曾對此事大施撻伐，根據「人道」，主張制裁；道理當然很對，但我以爲在目今，吃血之心，人皆有之，祇是明暗之分而已，何必驚奇？</p>
<p>何苦來</p>
<p>前幾時曾見上海報紙上刋載許多今年時裝大衣最新的式樣，洋洋乎儼然如衣着指南，但是報紙的另一面却又登着大批遠自雲南羅平攝取來的土民照片，全身赤條條約，連褲子都沒有，這實在是給我們自稱文明人的一個不算小的諷刺；同是中國土地，東西兩端，恍如隔世。有人說過上海所代表的一點點所謂文明，完全是表現在目迷五色的衣着上面，初聽像是侮辱，想想却是事實。試把每一個人華麗的衣飾揭開，身上不都是佈滿了狡詐，無恥，貪婪的疤痕？閉目遙想羅平那些光着身子，黝黑而健康的軀體裏面，包藏着一片那麽質樸而無疵的心地，的確太使人神往了！其實上海目前時裝之貴，並不是任何人都做得起的，但碍於面子，不得不千方百計的硬撑幾套試試新，也算在人前不致蹙額低頭，細細思索，眞何苦來？</p>

<h3>Chairman Issues Order for National Ceasefire to Show Government's Peace and Tolerance; Officially Implemented from Noon on the 11th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th, 8 PM] Chairman Chiang issued a ceasefire order to all military and political leaders on the 8th. From 12:00 noon on the 11th, all troops across the country will cease fighting and remain in their original defensive positions. The original order is as follows: Immediately upon receipt, Commander-in-Chief of the Army Headquarters, Gu; Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Headquarters, Gui; Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Headquarters, Zhou; Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, Huang; Directors of all Headquarters; Directors of all Pacification Commissioner Offices; Commanders of all War Zones; Commander of the Capital Garrison; Commanders of all Pacification Zones; Commanders-in-Chief of all Army Groups; Commanders of all Garrison Commands; Chairmen and Mayors of all Provincial and Municipal Governments, and to be forwarded to all Army Commanders: Since the enemy's surrender last year, the government's consistent policy has been to strive for peaceful unification and democratic construction, to resolve domestic disputes through political means, and to lay the foundation for national revival before the National Assembly. Although the Communist forces first attacked our national army in various places, forcing us to implement self-defense, our established policy of political resolution has remained consistent. Therefore, we have repeatedly exercised restraint, resulting in two ceasefires in January and June of this year and the postponement of the National Assembly. In order to demonstrate the government's commitment to its original policy, we hereby issue another order to cease conflict. We hope that you will quickly relay this to your subordinates, ensuring that all troops across the country cease fighting from 12:00 noon on November 1st, and remain in their original defensive positions, to show the government's utmost sincerity in peace and tolerance. Please strictly abide by this order without fail. Chiang Chung-cheng, on the evening of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Peace talks reached their highest point of stagnation on the evening of the 7th, but took a sharp turn for the better on the morning of the 8th, and the situation immediately unfolded. At 2:30 PM, the government issued an order to cease military conflict, and at 6:00 PM, the Minister of Information held a press conference to announce the Chairman's statement on the issuance of the ceasefire order. Chinese and foreign journalists gathered at the Central Daily News building at 6:00 PM, waiting for Mr. Peng's arrival and preparing to film the event. The room was filled with a bright and cheerful atmosphere. At 5:50 PM, Peng arrived with the Chinese and English versions of the Chairman's statement and immediately announced it. The room was filled with the sound of cameras and flashing lights, creating a very grand atmosphere. After Peng finished reading, our reporter asked whether this kind of ceasefire was permanent. Peng said: Yes, if no one else attacks, we will never retaliate. The press conference ended at 7:10 PM.</p>
<h3>Chairman to Issue Special Statement Reaffirming the Scheduled Opening of the National Assembly and the Preservation of Seats for All Parties; Hoping the CCP Will Attend the Three-Person Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th, 7:10 PM] The Ministry of Information held an impromptu press conference at 6:50 PM on the 8th, where Minister Peng Xuepei read Chairman Chiang's statement, announcing that he had ordered the national army inside and outside the passes to cease military operations. The full text of Chairman Chiang's statement is as follows:</p>
<p>On October 16th of this year, I issued a statement on the government's handling of the current situation, including eight proposals as the basis for a ceasefire agreement. I originally hoped that this statement would receive a response from the CCP to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire. Now, on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, I reiterate that the government's consistent policy is to promote domestic peace and national unity in order to achieve the goal of ending political tutelage and beginning constitutional government. The government sincerely hopes that our country can achieve lasting peace and political stability. To realize this hope, we have ordered the national army inside and outside the passes to cease all military actions, except those necessary for defending current locations.</p>
<p>According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the National Assembly was originally scheduled to convene on May 5th of this year. However, the CCP and other parties refused to submit the names of their representatives. On July 4th, the government announced that the National Assembly would convene on November 12th, so that all parties could have four months to discuss and prepare. However, the various parties expressed disagreement, stating that the steps agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference to reorganize the government had not yet been implemented. However, I would like to explain that in the six months since the Political Consultative Conference closed, the general situation has changed greatly. Serious fighting broke out in the Northeast outside the passes and then spread to North China. The reorganization of the CCP's troops has not yet been implemented according to the agreed plan. Under these circumstances, the political agreement failed to achieve results. Now, the representatives legally elected to the National Assembly have reported as scheduled. The National Assembly cannot be postponed any longer, as this would increase political and military instability and deepen the suffering of the people. Moreover, convening the National Assembly is the only legal step for the government to return power to the people, and it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the government has decided that the National Assembly will convene as scheduled on November 12th.</p>
<h3>After the National Assembly Opens, the Ambassador Decides to Go to Beiping</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, Entry Date] Ambassador Stuart stated in response to a reporter's question on the 8th that he did not believe the National Assembly would be postponed. He added that once the National Assembly opened, he would implement his plan to go to Beiping, which had already been postponed three times.</p>
<h3>Negotiating a Ceasefire</h3>
<p>My statement on October 16th already expressed the greatest degree of tolerance. I hope the CCP will accept it to resolve all outstanding issues. The government expects the CCP to follow the path of democracy with all parties, and that militarily, no political party should possess troops, and all troops should be national troops.</p>
<p>Therefore, the government has reserved the number of representatives that the CCP and other parties should attend in the National Assembly, still hoping that they will participate in the constitution-making at any time. At the same time, it hopes that the CCP will immediately send representatives to participate in the military three-person group meeting to discuss ceasefire measures based on the points raised in my October 16th statement, as well as the future allocation of troop locations, the restoration of transportation, and the reorganization and unification of troops, so that they can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Question of Reorganizing the Government</h3>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the National Government Committee, we hope to reach an agreement as soon as possible so that it can be formally reorganized and established. As for the Executive Yuan, it is the institution actually responsible, and its reorganization must be even more cautious. Therefore, this major change cannot be made rashly until the National Assembly closes. Regarding the constitutional government, it intends to submit to the National Assembly the uncompleted revised draft of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee. Within six months after the National Assembly closes, a national general election will be held in accordance with the Constitution. All parties and the people of the country can freely participate in the election to produce the next National Assembly, which will exercise its statutory powers in accordance with the Constitution. Therefore, if any party has opinions on amending the Constitution in the next National Assembly, it can still propose amendments in accordance with the law. These few weeks are a crucial turning point in the rise and fall of the nation. If we can do our best, it will not be difficult to establish a strong, prosperous, and democratic China. We must overcome any prejudices, suspicions, and hatred, and transcend all difficulties to contribute to the interests of the entire people. Today, the most urgent need of the people of the country is peace and stability. I deeply hope that my party comrades, people from all parties, social elites, government colleagues, all officers and soldiers, and all relevant parties must unite sincerely and cooperate fully to achieve the goals of "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army" in a peaceful manner. (End)</p>
<h3>The CCP's View: The Prospects for Peace Talks Are Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Communist Party representative held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Meiyuan New Village office at 11:00 PM on the 8th, expressing the following views on the Chairman's statement on the 8th: The National Government's unilateral announcement of the "cessation of other military actions" was not consulted with the Communist Party representatives beforehand, and the exception of "necessary for defending current locations" can still be used as an excuse for all military actions. All the political solutions proposed are contrary to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its procedures. Therefore, the future of negotiations is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Remarks</h3>
<p>Hoping All Parties Will Continue to Strive for Peace</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Government representative Wu Tiecheng said to reporters after the Chairman issued his statement: Mr. Shao and I went to Shanghai last month to invite representatives from all parties to return to Nanjing, hoping to promote negotiations and achieve peace as soon as possible. After the representatives of all parties returned to Nanjing, they worked hard. It was once suggested that the Chairman make a concession to the eight principles. The government has repeatedly expressed restraint, but the Communist Party has not yet agreed, which is regrettable. Now that the National Assembly is about to convene, the government has automatically issued a ceasefire order. This kind of painstaking effort to love peace is witnessed by compatriots across the country. I hope that people from all parties will consider the overall situation, seize the opportunity, and continue to work for peace.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] As the opening of the National Assembly approaches, representatives from various places are enthusiastically reporting to Nanjing. Feeling that the national situation is uncertain, they all want to meet with the Chairman to state their opinions. After Hong Lanyou, the secretary of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, met with the Chairman on the evening of the 7th, it was decided that the Preparatory Committee would invite representatives who came to Nanjing to hold a tea party at the Lixing Society on the morning of the 8th, and respectfully request the Chairman to deliver a speech.

The Chairman arrived at 10:30 AM, and the entire venue stood up to pay their respects and applaud to welcome him. After taking their seats, Hong Lanyou first delivered a speech, saying briefly: The representatives have successively arrived in Nanjing and have given instructions on the various facilities of the Preparatory Committee, which is very grateful. The gentlemen have instructed us to convey their respects to the Chairman and hope to have the opportunity to visit him, which has been conveyed one by one. The Chairman gladly attended the talk on the 8th and gathered with the gentlemen. Please give instructions from the Chairman, and we also hope that the representatives will express their high opinions. After the report, representatives Wang Puhan, Liu Guanxun, Fang Shaoyun, Li Hongru, and Chen Zifeng expressed their opinions. The opinions expressed are summarized as follows: (1) Since the National Government has scheduled the opening of the National Assembly, it should be held as scheduled. The National Assembly is the only way to achieve peaceful unification. The colleagues hope that all parties and factions can participate. (2) The government has always adopted a consultative attitude, which the colleagues understand deeply. They hope that before the National Assembly is convened, if the parties concerned are sincere and submit a list of representatives, they can ask the government to follow its past attitude of generosity and tolerance, consider ceasing military actions, and continue the spirit of consultation, so that the National Assembly can be convened in a harmonious atmosphere. (3) In terms of the Constitution, it is hoped that it will not violate the principles of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. After listening to the opinions of the representatives, the Chairman stood up three times to deliver a speech, saying briefly: I am very pleased to be able to meet with all of you today. This National Assembly is related to the rise and fall of the nation and the honor and disgrace of the people, and has a huge impact on the future of national construction. The responsibility of the representatives is also very heavy. I hope that they can truly build a constitutional foundation and set a permanent example, so that the people who have suffered long-term trauma can obtain true welfare and seek the long-term prosperity and happiness of the country. The Chairman also replied that the first and second points are willing to be seriously considered by the government colleagues in order to adopt the opinions of the representatives. On the third point, the constitutional issue, if you have better opinions, please submit them as much as possible during the meeting. The tea party ended at 11:30 AM.</p>
<h3>The American and British Ambassadors Visit the Chairman; The CCP's Response to the Eight Principles is Delivered to the British Ambassador; Sun Ke Invites Representatives to Discuss the Procedures of the Comprehensive Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Special Envoy Merrell visited Ambassador Stuart at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 8th and talked for about an hour and a half. Then, at 11:30 AM, he and Ambassador Stuart visited the Chairman together and talked for an hour before leaving. The Chairman immediately hosted a banquet for government representatives Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Bai Chongxi, and Chen Cheng at 1:00 PM and talked for over an hour.

The Military Three-Person Group meeting may be held in the afternoon. In addition, the Communist Party's response to Chairman Chiang's eight principles of October 16th has been delivered to Special Envoy Merrell tonight.</p>
<h3>After the Chairman Issues a Statement, Parties Present Their Views; Providing Explanations on the Constitutional Draft and the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Chairman Chiang issued a statement, Zhang Junmai, Zhang Shenfu, Shen Junru, and Luo Longji of the Democratic League, Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang of the Youth Party, and Miao Jiaming, Hu Zhengzhi, and Mo Dehui of the social elites held a meeting at the Bank of Communications at 6:00 PM and invited Zhou Enlai, Li Weihan, and Deng Yingchao of the Communist Party to attend. First, the Communist Party's response to the eight principles proposed by Chairman Chiang on October 16th was discussed. The Communist Party also decided to deliver it to Special Envoy Merrell that evening. Then, Zhou Enlai and others left first and continued the meeting to study the statement issued by the Chairman on the 8th. After the meeting, at 10:00 PM, an impromptu press conference was held, where Xi Longji read their opinions on the Chairman's statement as follows: "General opinion, because of the urgency of time, the entire text has not been studied in detail. The point of ceasefire is in line with the wishes of the people of the country, but in terms of the scope involved, it is considered that all the methods mentioned in the statement are very different from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its procedures. Moreover, according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the sole authority of this National Assembly is to formulate the Constitution, and its nature is sacred and solemn. In this statement by Chairman Chiang, there are doubts about the National Assembly and the Constitution. (1) Since constitution-making is a century-long undertaking, the move to reserve seats for national representatives not only sets an unprecedented precedent in the history of constitution-making in the world, but also loses the dignity of the law-making conference; (2) The constitutional draft comes from an agreement. Now that the agreement on the constitutional draft has not been completed, handing it over to the National Assembly for a decision will inevitably lead to endless disputes in the future; (3) The amendment of the Constitution should stipulate the amendment procedures in the Constitution. Now that the law has not yet been determined, the possibility of amending it in six months is reserved. How can this fundamental law, which is so unstable, ensure the adherence of the people of the country?"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] After the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites expressed their opinions on Chairman Chiang's statement, reporters visited government representative Zhang Lisheng to ask for his thoughts on this opinion. Zhang refused to answer and seemed relaxed, as if he did not take it seriously. (There is also a special feature on "The Process of Negotiations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" on page 2.)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The battles in Yi County and Laishui are deadlocked. The threat to the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has not been completely lifted.

<h3>External Spokesperson Talks to Reporters: The True Spirit of the Sino-American Treaty; Clear Explanation of the Meaning of Most-Favored-Nation Status</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the signing and public announcement of the Sino-American Treaty on the 4th, various circles have had different criticisms. In order to understand the true spirit of the treaty and the official explanations regarding certain comments, our reporter made a special visit to the external spokesperson to inquire about several key points. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Is there any protection for the occupations of our citizens? (Answer) Article 2, Section 2 stipulates that citizens of the other contracting party may only engage in occupations not exclusively reserved for citizens of the contracting party, and may only enjoy such rights in their individual capacity. If a contracting party deems that a certain occupation should be reserved for its own citizens, it may at any time stipulate this by law.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there any protection for our legal persons and organizations? (Answer) Article 3, Section 3 stipulates that legal persons and organizations of the other contracting party should generally enjoy the same treatment as legal persons and organizations of the contracting party when conducting various businesses in accordance with the law within the territory of the contracting party. This does not apply if the laws of the contracting party stipulate otherwise. Therefore, either contracting party may still grant certain necessary special treatment to its own legal persons and organizations, which is completely the same as the provisions of Article 297 of our Company Law.</p>
<p>(Question) Is tariff autonomy affected? (Answer) Article 16 of this treaty stipulates that the tariffs paid on goods from the other party entering this party shall not be higher than the national taxes paid on goods from any third country. Under this provision, if our country deems it necessary to raise tariffs to protect domestic industries, it will not be subject to any restrictions, except that it must give the United States most-favored-nation treatment, that is, equal treatment. As for imported goods, regardless of whether they are imported by foreigners or Chinese, they must pay the same import tax. This is not only our current tariff practice but also a common practice in all countries of the world.</p>
<p>(Question) Why are there provisions on immigration in the treaty? (Answer) The United States Congress passed a bill in 1923 stipulating that all commercial treaties must expressly state that they shall not affect existing immigration laws and the right to enact immigration laws in the future. Since 1923, the United States has had the above-mentioned reservation clause in all its commercial treaties, without exception. Therefore, the first sentence of Article 2, Section 4 of this treaty is not a provision specifically for our country. Although our country does not yet have an immigration law, if it is deemed necessary in the future, our country has the freedom to enact such a law at any time. Moreover, the United States' law of February 5, 1917, restricting the entry of people from certain regions, has been expressly stated in this treaty not to apply to Chinese people. This provision can also serve as a guarantee that Chinese people should not be discriminated against.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the meaning of the most-favored-nation clause in this treaty? (Answer) According to common practice, the treatment granted by any treaty is either national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment. There is no other standard. When stipulating most-favored-nation treatment, there are two meanings: (A) it means that national treatment cannot be granted; (B) it allows being on an equal footing with third countries and not being subject to discriminatory treatment. Although there is a most-favored-nation clause in the treaty, if we do not give any special preferences to any country, then this clause will not be effective. As for which items in this treaty should be given national treatment and which should be given most-favored-nation treatment, this Ministry, together with relevant agencies, carefully reviewed them before making a decision, and repeatedly negotiated with the United States to reach an agreement. Moreover, because international business relations are ever-changing, the effective period of this treaty is only five years, at which time the effect of implementation will be used as the basis for whether to revise a new treaty.</p>

<h3>国共商谈经过</h3>
<p>— 本报资料室特辑</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Political Consultative Conference, the government has repeatedly sought an early resolution to national affairs with a broad and tolerant attitude. However, extraneous matters have repeatedly arisen, leading to delays until the present day. Now, the government, accepting the resolution of the National Assembly representatives, has ordered the cessation of military actions and has acted with openness and candor, as all the world can see. We now trace the course of negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as follows:</p>
<p>The convocation of the conference was based on the "Record of Unity Talks" signed by the Kuomintang government and the CCP representatives in the 34th year of the Republic (1945). It stipulated that the National Government convene a consultative conference, inviting representatives of all parties and social elites to participate, to discuss national affairs and formulate a peaceful nation-building plan.</p>
<p>On January 6th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), the methods for convening the conference and the list of members were approved and promulgated by the Chairman of the National Government. On the 10th, the Political Consultative Conference opened in the auditorium of the National Government in the temporary capital, Chongqing, and concluded on the 31st. After repeated meetings and group discussions, five agreements were established: on government organization, the National Assembly, the program for peaceful nation-building, military affairs, and the draft constitution. During the conference, the government and the CCP authorities separately ordered their subordinates to cease conflicts and restore transportation. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced that the government would immediately implement "guarantee of people's freedom," "recognition of the legal status of political parties," "universal suffrage," and "release of political prisoners." The people of the whole country were overjoyed upon hearing this.</p>
<p>On February 15th, the Military Tripartite Group meeting, composed of Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall, formally signed the basic plan for the reorganization of troops and the integration of the CCP's troops into the national army. It contained two important provisions: (1) Command authority - the Chairman of the National Government is the supreme commander of the Chinese army, navy, and air force. (2) Organization - the national army will be reduced to 108 divisions, including 18 divisions of the Communist army. This plan served as the basis for implementing the agreement on military affairs in the Political Consultative Conference. However, the CCP side was unwilling to implement the unified reorganization, continuing to disrupt transportation and seize cities. When the National Army went to the Northeast to take over territorial sovereignty, they were repeatedly obstructed, leading to full-scale conflict. Military negotiations came to a standstill. Through the efforts of Special Envoy Marshall, the long-dormant political negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party began on May 25th at the private residence of Mr. Shao Lizi in the capital. The government representatives were Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, and Wang Shijie, and the CCP representatives were Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lu Dingyi. The two sides exchanged views on the issues of ceasefire, truce, and restoration of transportation, but no concrete decisions were made.</p>
<p>In order to promote peace, the government issued an order on June 7th, ceasing military actions in the Northeast for fifteen days. However, the CCP still showed no sincerity, and by the 22nd, the deadline expired without any progress. The government, seeking to preserve the overall situation, ordered an extension until the end of June.</p>
<p>On June 23rd, the Military Tripartite Group meeting officially resumed. The CCP representatives put forward a counter-proposal on troop reorganization, and the government also proposed a new plan for troop reorganization. Special Envoy Marshall tried his best in the meeting to reconcile the views of both sides, but it was still not easy to reach an agreement. In the end, because the CCP expressed its inability to accept the issue of Marshall's arbitration power, the meeting ended without results.</p>
<p>On July 3rd, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with CCP representative Zhou Enlai, reiterating his consistent stance for peace. That night, the representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party began direct negotiations, but because the Communist side insisted on holding the Political Consultative Conference first, while the government representatives advocated conducting military negotiations only, the talks once again came to a stalemate and broke up on the 8th without results. Afterwards, although Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart tried hard to mediate and held sporadic talks, they were intermittent and unproductive.</p>
<p>On July 26th, Zhou Enlai met with Special Envoy Marshall in Nanjing, and then Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Special Envoy Marshall exchanged views in writing. The negotiations seemed to have a turning point, but because the CCP insisted on a so-called unconditional ceasefire, peace talks were once again obstructed.</p>
<p>Thereafter, although Marshalls and Stuart made efforts to pursue peace and held repeated negotiations, they were unable to reach a solution. The crux of the matter lay in the CCP's demand that after the CCP army withdrew, the withdrawn area would still maintain the CCP's government organization. This would hinder national unity, and Marshall's mission was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>On August 13th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a public message to the nation, outlining six points on how to handle the current situation in the future. He expressed his sincere compliance with all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Regarding political disputes, he would still adopt political solutions, but the Communist Party's army should abide by the agreement on the nationalization of the army. Once this was guaranteed, the government could discuss all unresolved issues in concrete terms at any time. Through repeated consultations, both sides agreed to start negotiations by reorganizing the government. On August 29th, Marshall met with Zhou Enlai to discuss the exchange of opinions on the reorganization of the government by a five-person group consisting of two representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and one American representative. However, on September 6th, the CCP representatives suddenly raised the so-called "ceasefire guarantee" requirement, creating unnecessary complications, and the five-person group became inactive. On September 13th, CCP representative Zhou Enlai suddenly suggested to Marshall that the Military Tripartite Group meeting be restored, believing that a ceasefire was a prerequisite for peace and that the military group could discuss the ceasefire issue, which was simpler than discussing the political five-person meeting. However, Marshall had previously traveled back and forth between Nanjing and Lushan several times, mainly advocating that political and military negotiations should proceed simultaneously, and this now became a dispute between the "three-person" and "five-person" groups. On September 17th, Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai and gave a speech to foreign reporters on the 20th, stating that the CCP would withdraw from political negotiations, further deteriorating the situation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing on September 27th and expressed to Marshall and Stuart that he agreed to convene both the five-person meeting and the three-person meeting at the same time to show the government's sincerity in hoping for peace. Zhou Enlai also had no objection, and the peace negotiations seemed to have a turning point, but the CCP suddenly emphasized the military conflict in Zhangjiakou, submitting a memorandum to the government, which cast a shadow over the atmosphere of peace. On October 8th, Marshall put forward a new suggestion for a limited-time ceasefire. The government expressed its agreement and, at the same time, hoped that Zhou Enlai would return to Nanjing to participate in the negotiations. Marshall came to Shanghai to urge him to do so. Representatives from the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and others also tried their best to mediate, hoping to save the overall situation. Sun Ke stayed in Shanghai, delaying his return to Nanjing, hoping to break the deadlock. On the 17th, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen, government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference, came to Shanghai one after another, inviting people from various parties and factions to go to Nanjing for negotiations, and jointly urged the CCP representatives to go to Nanjing together to discuss the major plan for peace. Zhou Enlai then returned with the mediators on the 21st to discuss the grand plan for peace.</p>
<p>Before the government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference came to Shanghai, the government had explained the eight basic points of the negotiations, and the CCP side had put forward two more demands. When Zhou Enlai and his party arrived in Nanjing, the two sides were still not close. However, the National Assembly was imminent, and the whole country yearned for peace. The government was generous and expressed its willingness to reorganize the National Government Committee immediately and has now issued three ceasefire orders. The prospects for peace talks may be seen at the opening of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issuance of the Final Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chairman of the National Government issued a ceasefire order, instructing all units of the National Army, Navy, and Air Force to cease fighting at 12:00 noon on the 11th of this month and remain in their current defensive positions, in order to demonstrate the government's utmost sincerity in seeking peace and tolerance. This ceasefire order, which has been desired by all parties, has finally been issued. There is no doubt that the issuance of this order will have a positive impact on the domestic situation. In the ceasefire order issued by the Chairman of the National Government, we see the following words: "Since the surrender of the enemy army last year, the government's consistent policy has been to seek peaceful unification and democratic construction, to resolve domestic disputes through political means, and to lay the foundation for national rejuvenation before the National Assembly. Although the Communist army has launched unprovoked attacks on our National Army in various places, forcing us to implement self-defense, our established policy of political resolution has remained consistent. Therefore, we have repeatedly shown tolerance, resulting in the two ceasefires in January and June of this year and the postponement of the convocation of the National Assembly. In order to demonstrate the government's commitment to implementing its original policy, we hereby issue another ceasefire order." Indeed, the issuance of ceasefire orders did not begin today, but the issuance of this ceasefire order has a particularly profound significance.</p>
<p>Since the surrender of Japan, our government, with the people as its priority, has been committed to seeking peaceful unification and democratic construction for the domestic situation. Therefore, we have repeatedly held discussions with various parties, factions, and social elites, hoping that agreements can be reached through consultation, mutually observed, and lead the country to a state of peaceful unification. Unfortunately, before the ink on the agreements was dry, new offensives were launched again. In order to protect the interests of the people and for the sake of self-defense, the government had no choice but to respond to force with force; the so-called agreements became mere pie in the sky. However, the government still adhered to its consistent policy of tolerance for the sake of the country, resulting in the two ceasefires in January and June of this year and the postponement of the National Assembly. However, the government's good intentions were not fully understood by all parties. As a result, as soon as the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist army's military offensive resumed. Recently, after the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, some people believed that this situation could not be allowed to continue. Therefore, they worked to mediate, believing that if the government could issue another ceasefire order, it would be of great benefit to the overall domestic situation. Peaceful unification and democratic construction have always been the government's consistent policy, and a ceasefire has always been what the government has sought day and night. Therefore, after accepting this suggestion, our Chairman issued a public message, stating eight points. If this position is understood, the government will immediately issue a ceasefire order. The meetings between the government and various parties in the past ten days have also been focused on this. Now that the government's ceasefire order has been issued, the improvement of the domestic situation can certainly be expected. We hope that the issuance of this ceasefire order will be the last ceasefire order, and that the domestic situation will no longer resort to force.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the issuance of this ceasefire order will be of great benefit to the current situation. The convocation of the National Assembly has been postponed before, and it cannot be postponed again now. From the nature of the National Assembly, the National Assembly represents the political parties that represent the people. This is a National Assembly of people's representatives, not a National Assembly of party representatives. In theory, the convocation of the National Assembly has nothing to do with party disputes. However, we cannot deny the objective facts of the current political situation. The government's tolerance for the sake of the country has been proven by numerous facts, and the issuance of this ceasefire order is the culmination of it. Due to the issuance of this ceasefire order, the government has done everything possible to fulfill the requests of all parties with great tolerance. How the situation will unfold in the future depends on the sincere cooperation of all parties. Standing from the perspective of the people, we hope that all parties can also express their sincerity in cooperating with the government with facts. For example, all parties and factions can participate in the convocation of the National Assembly and jointly resolve national affairs. The National Assembly is the center of peaceful unification and the beginning of democratic construction. The government respects the opinions of all parties, and now that it has issued a ceasefire order, the convocation of the National Assembly should be able to proceed in an atmosphere of peace. As for the military reorganization and other political issues, those that have already been agreed upon should be implemented promptly, and those that have not yet been agreed upon should be resolved in the peaceful atmosphere created by the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>May the issuance of this ceasefire order bring peace and brightness to the domestic situation that has been delayed for more than a year!</p>

<h3>Stolen Package, Jumping from Train to Escape: New Gang of Thieves on the Jinghu Line</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang Dispatch] Recently on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) railway line, incidents of thieves jumping from trains and stealing passengers' belongings have occurred frequently. Previously, two travelers from Zhenjiang, Liu Zhaorong and Zhou Peiyi, had their packages stolen by thieves jumping from trains, each losing tens of thousands of yuan. Yesterday, Mei Guangzhong, a partner at the Dajixiang cloth store in Dashikou, Zhenjiang, went to Shanghai to purchase cotton cloth. He boarded train No. 54 from Shanghai to return to Zhenjiang, purchased baggage tickets as required, and carried four pieces of cotton cloth. Because there were no seats or lights in the fourth-class carriage, he temporarily used the packages as seats. Unexpectedly, two passengers in the same carriage, one claiming to be Jiang Youhua, asked to sit on Mei's other package. Mei refused, but Jiang Youhua insisted that he was also traveling to Zhenjiang and that the packages would be safe under their bodies and that he would take care of them. Mei then trusted him. Unexpectedly, as the train passed Zhenjiangguan and was moving, the passenger sitting on Mei's package suddenly threw the package out of the train and jumped down to escape. The other passengers were greatly shocked, thinking a passenger had fallen off the train. Mei checked and found that one package of cotton cloth (14 bolts) he was carrying had been stolen by someone jumping off the train. At this time, Jiang Youhua, who had been sitting on the package, looked frightened but had not escaped. Mei knew he was an accomplice and immediately apprehended him. When the train arrived in Wangting, he was taken to the local police station for questioning and then sent to the Shanghai Railway Police Station for legal processing.</p>

<p>Our Ambitions—A Record of a Group of Idealistic and Passionate Young People Coming Together</p>
<p>From elementary school to university graduation, I have had hundreds of classmates and nearly a hundred friends, but here I want to talk about only eighteen. Currently, there are only eighteen, but I believe that number will definitely increase in the future.</p>
<p>I am very happy that I now have eighteen young friends with shared ideals. They have each had difficult and arduous experiences in school. Some have already graduated, and some are still in school. We all agree that China needs reform. We hate the remnants of feudalism that are still active and the emerging evil forces that keep appearing. We despise everything undemocratic, falsely democratic, unequal, unfree, and the endless selfishness and exploitation in this era. We witness foolishness and blindness, and we sympathize with those who suffer and the endless sorrow. We feel the need to reform them, overthrow them, and establish our new, reasonable world. We cannot and dare not believe that others will truly complete this mission. We have the courage and ambition to do our best, and we believe that we can do better than others. So we united, which took some effort in building friendship and undergoing a necessary period of doubt, but in the end, we became very good friends, very good comrades. I believe that our union is not a temporary emotional impulse, nor a blind action, but the result of our meticulous reason and calm observation.</p>
<p>We have three criteria for finding like-minded friends. First, we need him (or her) to be relatively intelligent, to have a mind capable of understanding complex problems, and to have the courage to take on difficult tasks. Second, our friends must have lofty ideals. Regardless of what ideology they believe in, as long as their ultimate goal is to build a strong and equal new China, to have a conscious sense of responsibility for the revitalization of the country, and to have ardent and strong confidence in their career, we do not want those hesitant and sorrowful types. Third, our friends should not be too selfish. Of course, everyone has some selfishness, more or less. We do not need to be harshly looking for friends who have no selfishness at all, and in fact, it is impossible to find them. However, selfishness must have a limit. In other words, we are willing to sacrifice for the country and for our friends, for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>Among the nineteen of us, I believe that I am the most inept one, but precisely because I am the most inept, I am also the most fortunate. I can learn from each of them their experiences and characteristics, and they can all sincerely understand my shortcomings.</p>
<p>This young group of us all grew up in this era.</p>
<p>This is the most unfortunate era, but also the most fortunate era. Why? We live in this turbulent, uneasy, poor, difficult, and depressing era and, even more unfortunately, grew up in China during this era. Not only have we suffered from material panic and torment, but our souls have also been shrouded in tragic and dark shadows. Our hearts are wounded. We are not only worried about everything in our motherland, but we are also concerned about the future of so-called civilized humanity, which is turbulent, cruel, ignorant, and blindly follows others. Therefore, we bear a double burden, causing us to lose many bright laughs and the enjoyment of peaceful and comfortable minds. We are troubled, we are in pain. In fact, we could choose not to bear this excessive spiritual pressure. We can escape thinking about it, caring about it, and even indulge in the illusion of narrow personal happiness, but we cannot get rid of it no matter what. Every day's newspaper is like a huge voice, calling you. The injustice and misery of the human world that we see is like a giant hand grabbing you, telling you to think about it, to care about it, taking away the peace of your innocent soul, taking away sweet dreams, and giving you excessive burdens and torment.</p>
<p>However, we are also fortunate to be born in this era, and even more fortunate to be born in China during this era. Because we never wanted to be ordinary people who lived a mediocre life. We are truly fortunate to be born in this land that can accommodate us to develop and create. Our entrepreneurial spirit is extremely strong and passionate. We are like a group of young, lively, and innocent craftsmen holding axes and saws, hoping to transform or build something, seeing an old and dilapidated house that needs to be rebuilt. We are full of eager anticipation. We are truly fortunate to be born in China, in China during this era! All the material and spiritual torments have only strengthened our strength and increased our perseverance. Our minds have become calmer, and our vision has become sharper.</p>
<p>We are definitely not the kind of young people who have no social experience and only a heart full of enthusiasm, nor are we worldly and gloomy people. I believe this myself, and I believe that every one of our friends is the same.</p>
<p>Although we have a grand common ideal, we all start from the most practical places. The first step is to cultivate our own love, sincerity, and trust for our friends. We trust every friend and help our friends as much as possible when necessary. This is the first test. If this step cannot be achieved, what are we talking about, let alone ideals like the nation?</p>
<p>Each of us regards the success or failure of our friends as our own success or failure, and the fortune or misfortune of our friends as our own fortune or misfortune. We encourage each other, we criticize each other kindly, we each hate our own shortcomings, and we also forgive the shortcomings of our friends.</p>
<p>Each of our friends plans to start working from his own position, establish a personal economic foundation. One friend who studies engineering has already started with a small construction factory. His ideal is to establish a modern, large-scale construction engineering enterprise. A friend who graduated from a Jiangxi agricultural college is preparing to reclaim land in Yunnan after graduation. Every friend works in his own position, develops his career, and establishes his economic foundation. We have good communication and travel methods to maintain our friendship, and in ten years, we will coordinate our respective achievements to achieve a comprehensive success.</p>
<p>I am really happy that our current friends are already distributed in important locations within China, such as Shenyang, Beiping, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Chengdu. From the names of the schools, there are Northeast University, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Zhongda University, Lida University, Wuhan University, Jiaotong University, Aurora University, Zhejiang University, and Sichuan University. In terms of departments, there are engineering, law, literature, education, economics, agronomy, politics, and aeronautical engineering. Some friends have not graduated this year. In two years, every friend will be able to enter society.</p>
<p>This is a scientific mass era, and fighting alone cannot achieve great success. Therefore, we will work hard to find our friends in the future, rationally discover our comrades. In five years, our friends will not only be all over the country, but also all over the world.</p>
<p>I believe that this large group of young friends is the true new blood of China, and only this group of young people is the reformer of China. At the same time, the reconstruction of China can only be undertaken by our young and righteous union.</p>
<p>My words are very self-assertive, no, simply arrogant, but I would rather be self-assertive and arrogant than retreat and be inferior.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish my friends good health! (Pan Xingzhao, October 35th,)</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Encounters Another Obstacle: Completely Opposing Opinions on the Italian Peace Treaty from the US and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Bloc Opposes US Trusteeship of Pacific Islands.</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 8th, Broadcast: The four foreign ministers encountered another major obstacle at their meeting this afternoon. The discussion today was on the Italian peace treaty, in which five major points were opposed by the Soviet Union. (1) Western European countries suggested that the Austrian treaty be included in the Italian peace treaty. The Soviet Union expressed its opposition. (2) The US suggested that countries previously allocated Italian territory should guarantee human rights to ethnic minorities. The Soviet Union expressed its opposition. (3) The French suggestion on the status of Trieste was also opposed by the Soviet Union, representing Tito. (4) The US suggested that Italy should compensate Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. The Soviet Union believed that the amount of compensation to Yugoslavia should be greater than that to other countries. (5) The US suggested that if they do not sign the treaty, the various benefits of Yugoslavia under the treaty should be canceled. The Soviet Union also opposed this.</p>
<p>[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 8th, Radio News: Today, the representatives of the Soviet Union and its satellite states strongly opposed the US proposal to place the former Japanese Pacific islands under a special trusteeship system. This type of trusteeship system would allow the US to obtain permanent rights to use the islands as defense bases and would cause the UN and the five major powers to lose their veto power or control in the region.</p>
<h3>Trieste Exchanged for Gorizia: Italy Rejects Tito's Request: Yugoslavia Hopes for Direct Negotiations Between the Two Countries to Resolve the Outstanding Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rome, 7th, Associated Press] The Italian Council of Ministers officially rejected Tito's request to exchange Trieste for Gorizia. The cabinet stated that Gorizia is part of Italian territory and has been recognized by the four foreign ministers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 7th] Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia suddenly announced in New York that he was abandoning his claims on the port of Trieste during discussions of the Trieste issue, which has caused great surprise here. According to Tito's proposal, Trieste could be retained by Italy, and the plan for a free zone in the draft treaty should be abolished. In exchange, Yugoslavia requested to obtain the city of Gorizia, which was to be returned to Italy according to the draft treaty. This proposal was brought back from Belgrade by the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Tugliatti. The content is: (1) Trieste is retained by Italy, but it should be given local autonomy similar to the Austrian district. (2) The city of Gorizia, which has a majority of Slavic people, is incorporated into Yugoslav territory. (3) Italian minorities remaining in Yugoslav territory have full civil rights and can establish Italian-language schools, etc. Italian prisoners of war still in Yugoslavia are immediately sent back to their country. (4) The two countries sign a commercial treaty, with Yugoslavia providing Italy with timber and other raw materials in exchange for its industrial products. Yugoslavia will accommodate Italian workers to alleviate the overcrowding in its country. The Italian cabinet has been discussing this proposal all day. However, right-wing elements have expressed opposition, accusing Tito of being generous with other people's property, and saying that Yugoslavia's proposal to abolish the free zone plan in Trieste is intended to allow the Allied forces to withdraw from the Trieste area so that it can carry out its conspiracy against Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 8th] The Italian Communist Party Committee issued a public statement this morning, declaring that Tito's proposal regarding Trieste and the eastern border of Italy is intended to resolve all issues between Italy and Yugoslavia through direct negotiations. Before the Italian cabinet meeting, it had rejected the proposal to cede the city of Gorizia to Yugoslavia, but expressed its support for Trieste to be retained by Italy.</p>
<h3>Our Representative Supports India's Position: Opposes South Africa's Annexation of Mandated Territories</h3>

<p>Girard Notifies the UN General Assembly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th, Special Dispatch] Girard, Secretary-General of the International Emergency Food Conference, informed the UN General Assembly's Economic and Financial Committee today that the future of world food is not optimistic. Although the world's production of cereals (including rice and wheat), meat, sugar, etc., has increased slightly this year compared to last year, this small increase has been offset by the uneven distribution and production.</p>
<h3>The Rift Between the East and West Blocs: The Netherlands Is Willing to Mediate Between the Two</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 7th] The Dutch government today issued a statement on its foreign policy, emphasizing that the Netherlands can play a part in the task of mediating between the Soviet Union and the Western bloc to avoid a new war. The Dutch government will do its best to understand the Soviet Union's foreign policy and avoid actions that could widen the rift between the East and West blocs. The statement pointed out that the world has already been divided into two blocs, which is undeniable, and this phenomenon has become more apparent at the Paris Conference. The Dutch government recognizes the danger of this situation and knows that both sides must work together to maintain peace. The statement also denied rumors that the Dutch government is particularly close to Britain or attached to the Western bloc, pointing out that such major powers do not need the help of small countries.</p>
<h3>Italy Appoints Ambassador to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The Italian government officially announced that it has appointed Prunas as its ambassador to the Soviet Union. The former ambassador, Gallarotti, has been transferred to serve as ambassador to France.

<h3>The US Transfers Several Air Bases to the Department of Commerce</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman today authorized the US Army and Navy to transfer several air bases in Alaska and the Pacific region that are no longer needed for military purposes to the Department of Commerce. The President's order also authorized the Department of Commerce to maintain these bases through the Civil Aeronautics Administration, or to turn them over to commercial airlines or the American people. The number and location of the bases to be transferred are to be determined by the Army and Navy.</p>
<h3>Truman Does Not Intend to Resign: The Republican Party Will Continue Its Existing Policy Toward China: The Attitude Toward the Soviet Union Will Become More Tough</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman will not resign, and this is being seriously considered. He believes that resigning after the Democratic Party's惨敗 is equivalent to deserting his post. Truman himself expressed silence about the election defeat, hinting that he would not make a statement until next week at the earliest. In addition, the general public seems to have agreed to the United States' existing policy toward the Philippines; most people also believe that the United States' policy on general issues in the Pacific, including policies toward China, Japan, and Korea, will continue to be implemented under Republican rule. Both the Republican and Democratic parties claim that the United States' foreign policy is a bipartisan policy and will continue to be so in the future.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] Newspapers run by the Popular Republican Movement Party, led by French President Bidault, today interpreted the results of the US election as "approving Byrnes and opposing Wallace." It is said that "Byrnes has won a great victory in the election. The failure of the Democratic Party should be largely attributed to former Commerce Secretary Wallace's Munich-style proposals." French newspapers believe that after the Republican Party's victory, the United States' attitude toward the Soviet Union will become tougher, but it will not return to isolationism.</p>
<p>Truman Can Use the Veto Power to Counterattack</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, Special Dispatch] Several Democratic officials in the United States who are deeply dissatisfied with the results of the general election recently stated that President Truman has absolutely no intention of resigning because of the Republican Party's victory. No president in American history has resigned. We hope that President Truman will use his veto power, which is supported by the Democratic Party, to counter the opposition of Congress. People close to the White House say that the president is bound to embark on a new path of "political freedom" because he will no longer have any obligations to any powerful pressure groups. Washington is closely watching the international reaction to the Republican Party's victory, especially from the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Truman Meets with Molotov: The Talk Did Not Involve Politics: Diplomats from Both Countries Held Secret Talks: The US Guarantees That Its Policy Toward the Soviet Union Will Not Change</h3>

Molotov and Fenton left the main hall and held talks in a private room. Fenton guaranteed to him that the victory of the Republican Party in the US competition would not change US-Soviet relations. Fenton provided some guarantees for future US economic policies and said that he would soon go to Moscow to meet with US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and take the opportunity to review the possibility of promoting Soviet-American cultural relations. Molotov then accompanied Ambassador Novikov to the White House to meet with President Truman, and the two talked for 12 minutes. White House Press Secretary Ross later stated that this was a social conversation and did not involve political events. Ross also said that to his knowledge, Molotov did not bring a greeting letter from Stalin to Truman, nor did Truman have such a letter to give to Molotov.</p>

<h3>Unresolved Japanese Reparations Issue: US Plans to Break the Deadlock; Korean Incident Takes a Turn; Soviet Union Willing to Resume Negotiations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th Dispatch] In order to break the deadlock with the Soviet Union, the United States has requested the cooperation of the countries on the Far Eastern Commission to draft a directive to be given to MacArthur for the distribution of Japanese reparations. Diplomatic sources announced today that, in view of the Soviet Union's unwillingness to participate in the reparations conference, the State Department is discussing the distribution of Japanese reparations with the ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission. The main points are: (1) 15 to 20 percent of the Japanese assets allocated for reparations will be immediately distributed among the countries claiming reparations. (2) The method for distributing the remaining 80 percent will be decided later. According to the US plan, the Far Eastern Commission can issue instructions to MacArthur for implementation after consultation, and then submit them to the Far Eastern Commission for review. If the Soviet Union still opposes this proposal, the plan will still be implemented.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 8th Dispatch] The Soviet military commander in northern Korea, General Terentii Shtykov, has indicated his willingness to return here to resume negotiations to implement the Moscow Agreement. The disagreement between the US and the Soviet Union lies in whether to allow Korean political parties and public organizations to participate in discussions on the organization of a provisional government. General Shtykov wrote to US military commander in southern Korea, General Hodge, on the 26th of last month, stating that the Soviet Union recognizes the right of Koreans to express their opinions to the US-Soviet Joint Commission.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Announces Comprehensive Purification Order</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] The Japanese government today announced a comprehensive purge of militarists in local areas, stating that the previous order to purge militarists was only implemented on members of parliament and key personnel of national policy companies. Now it also applies to influential figures in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the branches of the Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps at the prefectural, city, town, and village levels, and the veterans' associations. The aim is to eliminate militarism and extreme nationalism from local public office and promote the democratization of local autonomy.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Post-War Japanese Economy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch] Although the rate of increase in Japan's production index has been slow within the past year, it has more than doubled compared to the time of surrender last August, indicating that it is gradually entering a phase of economic stability. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, using the average from 1931 to 1933 as 100, the production index in September of last year was only 20 percent, while in August of this year it was 54.4 percent, an increase of 2.7 times compared to last year. According to statistics recently released by the Bank of Japan, using March of this year as 100, July was 156 percent and August was 166 percent. The volume of freight transported by national railways has also been increasing daily. According to Toyo</p>
<p>Economic Statistics,</p>
<p>using 1941 as 100, last September was only 8.3, while August of this year was 76.3 percent. In terms of prices, there is also a trend towards stability. According to a survey by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, using last November as 100, the black market price index in September of this year was 127.3 percent, a decrease of 5.7 percent from August's 135 percent. Prices peaked in April of this year, rising to 141.3 percent, and have gradually declined since then. Statistics recently released by the Bank of Japan also show a gradual decline in the black market. Using March of this year as 100, September was 89. Conversely, official prices have increased significantly, tending to</p>
<p>approach black market prices.</p>
<p>Using March of this year as 100, September was 2.4 percent. In terms of the amount of currency in circulation, the rate of increase has also slowed down. After the Japanese government implemented the Financial Measures Order in March of this year, the amount of Bank of Japan notes in circulation at the end of March was reduced to 23 billion yen. Subsequently, due to the food panic and a surge in withdrawals related to living expenses and wages, the</p>
<p>currency in circulation increased significantly,</p>
<p>reaching 70.225 billion yen by the 27th of this month, exceeding the previous highest amount in circulation. However, the food shortage situation has recently improved, and the rate of increase in note issuance has slowed down. The increase rate in June was 18 percent, while in October it was 10 percent. The most important key to Japan's economic activity in the future is whether production can continue to rise and restore normal economic relations. Judging from</p>
<p>current production</p>
<p>conditions, it is still not possible to draw optimistic conclusions. For the past year, most of the raw materials for production have been taken from existing reserves. If materials and raw materials are not imported from abroad, they will soon be exhausted. Labor-management disputes are also an important factor. For example, coal production has only been 1.67 million tons per month since June. The production of other materials such as steel and fertilizer remains sluggish. For example, the planned supply of steel materials from July to September was 55,000 tons from production and 45,000 tons from existing reserves, totaling 100,000 tons. The supply plan from October to December is 57,000 tons from production and 16,000 tons from reserves and special items, totaling 73,000 tons, a decrease of 27,000 tons from September. Regarding the interpretation of these economic indicators,</p>
<p>opinions from various parties</p>
<p>in the government and the public vary between pessimists and optimists. Finance Minister Narahashi stated that prices have remained relatively stable since March, and that if the policies adopted in the future are not flawed, they will absolutely not lead to inflation. The "Mainichi Shimbun" refuted the Finance Minister's argument, stating in an editorial on the 25th that the</p>
<p>financial measures</p>
<p>implemented in March temporarily contracted the currency in circulation from a peak of 68 billion yen to 16 billion yen, and then re-expanded to 60 billion yen by September, after which prices stabilized slightly. This was the result of artificial emergency measures. Moreover, the Bank of Japan's index places too much emphasis on the prices of staple foods. The good harvest this year has caused the prices of staple foods to decline, but this is far from matching the rapid decline in currency value. Therefore, there is no reason for optimism regarding Japan's finances, which are about to distribute a large amount of currency. The period from March to September can only be described as a temporary lull, but the government has failed to use it to create</p>
<p>the true foundation for Japan's reconstruction,</p>
<p>and it is regrettable that Japan's economic recovery has not yet gotten on the right track. However, the Toyo Keizai Shinpo, with the Finance Minister as its patron, is very optimistic. In an article published on the 29th, it stated that increasing production is not impossible, and that as prices gradually stabilize, the profits and losses of commercial operations can be predicted. If the supply of materials and resources becomes smooth,</p>
<p>increasing production</p>
<p>will be easy. Before the war, coal production was 5 to 6 million tons per month, and production will easily increase once management is effective. However, self-reliance in seeking economic recovery is limited, because currently, raw materials and resources are not supplied domestically, but must be imported from abroad. Therefore, within certain limits, production must still be promoted on the premise of self-reliance in order to exchange for imported goods. Therefore, the current situation is less of a worsening of inflation and more of a light at the end of the tunnel, making it the duty of the Japanese to further increase the current production index.</p>

<h3>At 1:15 AM This Morning, Friend of China, Carl Crow, Passes Away; Funeral to be Held Tomorrow at the International Funeral Parlor, Followed by Burial; Will Stipulates Bequests to be Donated to the Zili Lifen Society and Charitable Organizations; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Flew to Shanghai Yesterday for Two Visits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Carl Crow, former advisor to President Chiang Kai-shek, passed away at 1:15 AM this morning at the Hong En Hospital. The Shanghai Zili Lifen Society (2004 Nanjing West Road) has been ordered to handle the funeral arrangements. The body was moved to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road today. A memorial service will be held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 10th, followed by a simple funeral ceremony at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and burial in the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road on the same day. Carl Crow's will stipulates that all bequests will be donated by the Zili Lifen Society to various charitable organizations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Article] The cold autumn wind brought endless desolation. Yellow leaves quietly fell from the branches, and Hong En Hospital seemed even colder than usual. For the past three days, the 71-year-old Carl Crow had been in a dying state. This warrior who fought against "death" finally faced the irresistible "inevitability."</p>
<p>At Gengxiangshan, several doctors had told him that there was no hope of recovery in this life. But he finally returned to the China he could not forget, and finally saw President Chiang and Madame Chiang, who had completed the great task of resisting the war. Death, for Carl Crow, held no terror. When he fell into the hands of the Japanese soldiers in Manila, who had long wanted to capture him, he had already faced the possibility of death. Then came the four long years in a concentration camp!</p>
<p>In fact, during the Xi'an Incident, he also had the opportunity to be killed!</p>
<p>Every time danger came, he simply challenged it; he won in every challenge.</p>
<p>But for the past three days, the excited and humorous voice had finally disappeared in the dim ward. From then on, he could no longer speak - endless silence; shadows gradually spreading; coming from eternity, and ultimately returning to eternity.</p>
<p>His last words were to his secretary, he asked: "What time is it?"</p>
<p>Why did he still need to ask the time? Was he still waiting for something?</p>
<p>Yesterday, Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall flew to Shanghai at 12:35 PM. Madame Chiang arrived at Hong En Hospital two or three minutes after returning to her residence. Carl Crow was still conscious and nodded with a smile to Madame Chiang, but - even if he had a thousand words to say, he could not say them.</p>
<p>For the past two days, Dr. Zheng Zumu had been constantly administering heart stimulants to him, and because Carl Crow had difficulty breathing, he had also been using oxygen. Madame Chiang arrived at the hospital at 12:50 PM, accompanied by Mr. Huang Renlin and bodyguard Chiang Xiangqing. She left the hospital at 2:10 PM in the afternoon. At 6:30 PM in the evening, Madame Chiang visited again and did not leave until 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Dr. Zheng said softly: "From now on - anything is possible at any time."</p>
<p>Countless political secrets will disappear in silence. In the darkness, that pair of sharp and kind eyes seemed to appear before me.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Madam Soong Mei-ling, considering Mr. Carl Crow's deteriorating condition, took Marshal Marshall's four-engine special plane from Nanjing yesterday morning, arriving here at 12:35 PM. Also arriving were Mrs. Marshall and Director-General Huang Renlin. Madame Chiang wore a dark coffee-colored coat with beige collar trim, and a light purple cheongsam underneath. Those who went to Longhua Airport to welcome her included Mayor Wu's wife and Commander Xuan Tiewu. After getting off the plane, Madame Chiang accompanied Mrs. Marshall back to her private residence on Dongping Road. Madame Chiang, eager to visit Carl Crow, accompanied Mrs. Marshall upstairs after arriving at the residence, and after only three minutes, she took a car with Director-General Huang to Hong En Hospital.</p>

<h3>River Water Gradually Receding in Winter; Upstream Suitable for Shallow-Draft Steamers; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Sichuan River Line to be Affected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] As winter approaches, the water level of the Yangtze River is gradually decreasing, and the Sichuan River and Xiang River will enter the dry season. The Beiyang River in Tianjin, Niuzhuang, Andong, and other places will also freeze. According to the shipping industry, Niuzhuang will be frozen in half a month. However, the climate in Tianjin this year is different from previous years. If there is no major change in the weather, the Bai River will not freeze. The Yangtze River water level has slightly receded. Yesterday's report (7th) showed Jiujiang at 20 feet 9 inches, Hankou at 21 feet 3 inches, Yichang at 17 feet 2 inches, Chongqing at 16 feet 8 inches, and Changsha at minus 6 inches. Ships with a draft of more than 6 feet can no longer navigate. The water level of the Sichuan River is expected to continue to recede in the future, so shallow-draft river steamers are suitable for navigating the Sichuan River. Although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has the Jiangkang, Jiangqing, and Jiangling ships, the Jiangkang ship, which is the most suitable for navigating the Sichuan River, has been purchased by the Dada Datong Joint Venture. The company has repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry, requesting the Executive Yuan to reconsider, and originally proposed to exchange it for the Anhua and other two river ships, but the result was invalid. The Jiangling ship is under repair and will be difficult to repair within the year. The Jiangqing ship is too small in tonnage and cannot meet the transportation needs. Its horsepower is also a problem when navigating upstream during the dry season. This winter, the company's Sichuan River line will be significantly affected.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Liner Also Serves Zhenhai</h3>
<p>Another Dispatch: Shanghai-Ningbo liners, entering and leaving Zhenhai, except for the Dahua ship, which stops at Zhenhai when returning to Shanghai from Ningbo, other ships generally do not stop there. The Zhenhai Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly written to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting that the Jiangya ship stop there for the convenience of passengers. Yesterday, the company's passenger ticket department announced that it had agreed to the Zhenhai Chamber of Commerce's request for a stop. Starting next Monday, the Jiangya ship will implement this when sailing to Ningbo. In the future, passengers in Zhenhai will not need to go to Ningbo and can board and disembark in Zhenhai.</p>
<p>Australian Queen Ship Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>The giant ship Australian Queen arrived in Shanghai today. It is expected to arrive at Wusong and anchor at 8:30 AM this morning, without entering the port. It will set sail south tomorrow morning to return to the British Isles. 600 of our naval personnel going to England will take this ship abroad. The Java Company's Zhazhalianjia ship entered the port this afternoon and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Flies Red and Blue Flag to Indicate Prisoner-of-War Ship</h3>
<p>Loading Exchange Goods to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, at 11:30 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, the HC29 Fourth Riki Maru merchant ship arrived at the mouth of Wusong again. At a time when rumors about the discovery of ships flying the Rising Sun flag in the Huangpu River were rife, the Naval Coastal Defense Command did not allow it to enter and monitored it. Yesterday, our reporter telephoned Director Guo of the Coastal Defense Command, who said that this Japanese merchant ship, driven by Japanese, did not fly the Japanese flag. According to an investigation by personnel sent to investigate, the ship was carrying timber for the Central Trust Bureau. When the reporter inquired with the Central Trust Bureau, they also admitted that the ship was carrying 3,000 tons of "mining timber" exchanged from Japan to Shanghai. The ship did not fly the Japanese flag, but a "red and blue flag", which means a prisoner-of-war ship. Negotiations have been made with the Navy to allow it to enter the port. It was also said that several Japanese ships had been ordered to carry exchange goods to Shanghai and had not flown the Japanese flag.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Chamber of Commerce Delegation, Qiu Xiufu and Others, Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Chamber of Commerce delegation, led by Qiu Xiufu, chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by Jiang Shucheng, standing director, and Cai Henian, director, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM after attending the National Chamber of Commerce. According to Qiu, representatives from all parties were excited about the convening of the National Chamber of Commerce, which will make a significant contribution to the future exchange of goods between various regions. The Sichuan Province delegation to the National Chamber of Commerce totaled 22 people. Qiu and his party plan to stay in Shanghai for a short time before making a trip to North China to investigate post-war industry and commerce. The remaining ten or so representatives of the chamber of commerce delegation will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Coffin of Zhao Yijian Transported to Native Place for Burial</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhao Yijian, Director of the Fourth Hidden Department of the Ministry of National Defense, previously died in Shanghai due to thyroiditis. His coffin was temporarily placed in the Shanghai Funeral Home. Yesterday, personnel sent by the Ministry of National Defense came to Shanghai to hand over Mr. Zhao's coffin to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Peide ship, which was transported to Youtou yesterday for transshipment to his native place of Meixian for funeral and burial, and telegraphed local officials along the way to take good care of him. People from all walks of life in Nanjing and Shanghai went to pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Highway Administration Dismisses Personnel; Representatives Appointed to Appeal in Various Ways</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Ministry of Communications Highway Administration recently dismissed 270 personnel, giving them salaries for three months in the name of retention, and severance pay and travel expenses ranging from 24 to 60,000. All dismissed personnel, after eight years of hardship during the War of Resistance against Japan, bringing their wives and children with them and being loyal to the party and the country, had hoped for a better life after victory, but unexpectedly suffered unemployment. Moreover, they believe that although the bureau claimed that the dismissals were to reduce operations, they were actually to place private individuals. Therefore, the public was indignant and has appointed representatives to appeal to all walks of life in this city and in Nanjing, Hankou, Beiping, and other places, demanding that the severance be paid in accordance with the central government's regulations and that they be given the opportunity to transfer to other industries.</p>
<h3>Lost on the Atlantic, Drifting 4,000 Miles; Little Girl Returns Home After Years of Tribulation; A Legendary Tragic-Comedy in a Chaotic World</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Feature] On the stage of life, there are originally endless tragicomedies being performed. During wartime, this stage has added countless stories of joy and sorrow, worth singing and crying about. In this, tragedy is often far greater than comedy, and in the thousands of unfortunate encounters, we rarely find one or two happy endings, which can really be considered a "miracle." Here is a true story, narrating how a loving mother and her beloved daughter were separated for four and a half years in enemy bombing, separated by 4,000 miles, with no news of each other, and finally were able to reunite. Yesterday, the home of Mr. Li Qingmao at 348 Anhe Temple Road was filled with joy and gratitude for the arrival of such a miraculous miracle.</p>
<p>On February 13, 1942, Mrs. Li Deqiao, Mrs. Li Yuechang (daughter of the late famous ophthalmologist Li Qingmao), who lived in Singapore, took her six-year-old daughter Bai Di and two-year-old daughter Luodi on the refugee ship "Gula" to escape the brutal artillery fire of the Japanese invaders. At that time, Mr. Li Deqiao was on another ship and had already been separated. Unfortunately, on the second day after the ship set sail, the "Gula" was bombed by enemy aircraft and quickly sank. At this critical moment, Mrs. Li could only hold her younger daughter Luodi and then tell Little Bai Di to grab the handle of a box and not let go. As for herself, she didn't know how to swim, and in a moment of dizziness, Little Luodi unknowingly slipped out of her arms.</p>
<p>When she woke up, Mrs. Li found that she and many other passengers had been rescued by the Japanese, but her two daughters were nowhere to be found. Three months later, she secretly escaped from the Japanese concentration camp and took a junk boat back to Singapore. From then on, Mrs. Li lived alone, shedding the hot tears of a loving mother who had lost her beloved daughter in painful remembrance and hope, dreaming of the day when her beloved daughter would return to her arms - two years, two years, and four and a half sad years passed.</p>
<p>Heaven finally gave her a last chance. It turned out that Bai Di relied on her life-saving object - a box - and drifted in the sea, was rescued by the Japanese, taken to Guadalcanal Island 4,000 miles away, and handed over to an old nanny in the camp. During this period, Little Bai Di suffered countless hardships. Until Guadalcanal was recaptured by the US military, local residents found an abandoned little girl in a ditch. The back of her head was injured by the butt of a Japanese gun, and both arms were stabbed by military knives. Her poor little life was already dying. The residents could not bear to watch her die, so they sent her to the US Navy camp and handed her over to the camp teacher, Gavin. Reverend Gavin had taught in China for many years and was proficient in eight Chinese dialects, but Little Bai Di still could not communicate with him and only told him her name was Bai Di, so Reverend Gavin gave her the name Patsy.</p>
<p>Little Bai Di fortunately gradually recovered her health and was sent by the US military authorities to two orphanages in Espiritu Santo and Efate. At that time, a New York Times reporter, Hailey, published two articles describing this Chinese girl stranded in a foreign land. At this time, Mrs. Li's younger sister, Ms. Lin Li Yuee, was studying cancer at a hospital in New York. After seeing this news in the newspaper, she guessed that it was her little niece. When the war ended in August of last year, Ms. Li Yuee immediately wrote a letter to tell her sister the good news. Mrs. Li Yuechang was filled with mixed feelings of sadness and joy and hurriedly wrote to Hailey and Gavin, confirming that she had a missing child who matched what they said.</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Li exhausted her strength and tongue and, after much torment, finally flew from Singapore to Sydney, Australia, and then took a French steamship to Vila. She brought photos and handwriting of Little Bai Di and explained that there was a small scar on the side of her left eye, proving that it was indeed her almost lost beloved daughter.</p>
<p>However, after four and a half years (Little Bai Di celebrated her eleventh birthday on the first of this month), when she saw her mother, she could no longer recognize her. Mrs. Li said with tears in her eyes: "I don't recognize her either." But finally, Little Bai Di was very happy and returned to Singapore in her mother's arms.</p>
<p>Like a general rule, this tragedy turned into a comedy. But what about Little Luodi! There is still no news. We and Mrs. Li similarly hope that a second "miracle" will come!</p>
<p>Little Bai Di before she was lost, only six years old</p>
<p>Four and a half years later, after being rescued, Little Bai Di did not even recognize her mother.</p>
<h3>A Job Search Ends in Death: Heartless Man and Woman Conspire to Strangle Her Husband; The Nameless Male Corpse Case in a Small Creek on Zhongxing Road Solved; Two Criminals Arrested and Detailed Confession Obtained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A male corpse, hands bound with rope, was discovered in a small creek near the entrance of the Yuying Hall on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, on the evening of the 3rd at 8:00 PM. Details have been reported in this newspaper. At the time, Zhabei Branch police officers found a cigarette case near the deceased, containing a pass bearing the name Gu Yucai, 30 years old, from the First Bao, Fourth Jia, Xinglong Township, Chongming. The branch chief then ordered section chief Wang Shoulin to dispatch officers Shi Xueliang and Chen Fulin to Chongming to investigate. They found Gu Yucai's home, and after questioning, learned that the deceased was indeed Gu. They then brought Gu's mother, Qin (79 years old), to Shanghai. After detailed questioning by the police, it was learned that his daughter-in-law, Gu Cheng Cuiying, 30 years old, was a female worker at the Xinshen No. 9 Factory in West Shanghai. She had returned home once last month, and her son Yucai also planned to come to Shanghai to work, asking her to help find him a place to stay. She said that doing business in Shanghai required a cash deposit of one or two million. Later, she received a letter from Cuiying in Shanghai, saying that she had secured a shipping business opportunity, but he needed to bring money to Shanghai. On the morning of the 3rd, Yucai took a boat to Shanghai, saying that his daughter-in-law Cuiying lived at No. 19 Qi Chuan's house in Cunshan Lane, Caojiadu. Officers were then dispatched to investigate. According to people at that address, she had not been staying there for some time. They also searched for her at Xinshen No. 9 Factory, but could not find her. Later, a Chongming male worker, Yang Peiyu, said that he only knew that her younger brother, Cheng Xijie (21 years old), was an apprentice at the Fuchang New Flour Mill on Wan'an Road, Jiangwan. Xijie was then brought to the police station for questioning and confessed that his sister was at No. 4 Tan Jiaqiao, Zhabei. On the 7th, he was taken to that location, where the woman and her lover, Xu Meifang, were arrested and taken to the station for preliminary interrogation, where they finally confessed the truth. According to Xu Meifang, 38 years old, from Suzhou, he ran a barrel-making shop at No. 4 Tan Jiaqiao. In July, after his first wife died, he began living with Cheng Cuiying. Cheng Cuiying confessed that Gu Yucai was killed by her. She had discussed it with her lover beforehand, fearing that her relationship would be difficult to keep secret when her husband came to Shanghai. Xu then suggested killing Yucai after he arrived in Shanghai. For days, he ordered Cheng to wait at the pier. On the afternoon of the 3rd, she went with a close female friend, unaware that Xu was following them. Soon after, the ship arrived in Shanghai, and Yucai disembarked. After they met, the two women left. She and her husband went to see a play at the Xianshi Amusement Park, and then went out for dinner, while Xu followed closely behind. Then she lied, saying that a business deal had been secured and that they needed to go to the North Station to meet the introducer in order to get the job. Yucai trusted her and took a streetcar to Xinzha Bridge and walked north. When they reached Zhongxing Road, it was exceptionally dark. Xu saw that no one was around, took out the prepared hemp rope, and put it around her husband's neck from behind. Her husband, caught off guard, immediately fell to the ground. She tightened the rope, and he quickly died. Then she bound his hands and dumped him in a nearby small creek. After recording their statements, they were sent to the judicial authorities for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Ju Feng Silver Store Commits Deceit: Inlaid Gem Rings Switched</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Hao Shaoxi, a refugee from northern Jiangsu, went to Jufeng Silver Store on Sichuan North Road, near Old Baz Road, at 5:00 PM on the 24th of last month with his friend Zhang Guoxiang. He requested that two gold rings be inlaid with a yellow gemstone (commonly known as cat's eye) and a red gemstone (rose purple), respectively. The employee Bao Baokang negotiated and agreed to deliver the goods in six days, and then took the receipt and left. When he went to pick up the rings, both gemstones were not the originals, and he refused to accept them. According to the owner, Wang Yiqi, one cat's eye gemstone had been lost by the silversmith, but the silversmith had just left Shanghai to return to his hometown. Hao said that the two gemstones were ancestral heirlooms. Before the war, they were estimated to be worth one hundred shi of rice. The red gemstone is currently worth five to six hundred thousand yuan at market prices. He reported the situation to the Hongri Branch, and Section Chief Shi immediately ordered police officers to arrest Wang Yiqi and Bao Baokang for questioning. They were evasive. Section Chief Shi believed that Hao Shaoxi was a country bumpkin who could be deceived, and that they intended to take possession of the gemstones. He ordered their detention and transfer to the local prosecutor's office for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Eliminate Theft on the Huangpu River: Pay Attention to Workers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the rampant theft on the Huangpu River, a reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Water Police Branch, who said: There is absolutely no problem with theft on the water. Theft on green boats can be divided into two types: (1) Dock workers, because of low wages, cannot make a living and often take advantage of their work to steal goods when they finish work. Although the quantity is not large, the total is considerable. The branch is currently working to eliminate this, and the first step is to strictly control the foremen. Whenever workers finish work, plainclothes officers are dispatched to the scene to monitor. If such an incident occurs, they will be arrested and investigated. (2) Thieves mix in with the workers to steal. Whenever foreign ships arrive at the port to open their holds and unload goods, detectives are secretly dispatched to check the workers' badges one by one. Anyone who is not a worker and is found mixed in the hold will be arrested and interrogated. Recently, the branch has decided to eliminate theft on the Huangpu River and hopes that all shipping companies will assist at any time to facilitate progress. If an incident occurs, you can call 88867 or 88061.</p>

<h3>General Manager of Yi Taixing Weeps Inconsolably; Shen Jinzhou Denies Aiding the Enemy; Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 15th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court concluded the trial of Shen Jinzhou, general manager of the Yi Taixing coal briquette factory, on charges of being a traitor, yesterday morning and scheduled sentencing for 9:30 AM on the 15th. Shen is currently 60 years old, a native of Yuyao. After the victory, he was reported, alleging that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of coal in Shanghai fell into enemy hands. The incoming coal was controlled and operated by the Coal Association organized by Japanese companies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yamashita. Shen Jinzhou and 16 fellow merchants of Dachang pooled funds to organize the Dazhong Lian Coal Company. Shen was elected as chairman and purchased coal from the Coal Association. Because the quantity was insufficient, he supplied it to the city through an allocation system. In 1933, the coal company was reorganized into the Da巾Lian Coal Company Unified Distribution Office, and Shen was re-elected as the managing director. His business remained the same as before. From January 1934, because the enemy was losing the Pacific War and lacked shipping, the coal company sent civilian ships to Qingdao to transport coal to Shanghai, half of which was used by the enemy military and half of which was supplied to the city.</p>
<p>Since the case was prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office, the High Court has held several hearings to investigate. Shen has denied aiding the enemy with coal. When he was brought in for questioning yesterday, he was already in tears before he could speak. He testified: After the outbreak of the Pacific War, all the coal in Shanghai was controlled by the Coal Association, causing a great shortage of coal on the market. The shops had no goods to supply, and the citizens had no coal briquettes to burn. At that time, the person in charge of the original trade association had dispersed, so many fellow merchants came to me and asked for ways to help. So, I organized the Dazhong Lian Coal Company Unified Distribution Office, registered with the Coal Association, and after being allocated coal, distributed it to fellow merchants for retail to citizens. Because there were more monks than porridge, the distribution could not be averaged, causing jealousy among a few fellow merchants, which led to the occurrence of this case. As for saying that coal was transported from Qingdao to Shanghai to aid the enemy, that is not the case. He asked the court to declare him innocent.</p>
<h3>Qian Zhongdao and Ma Wenlin Indicted by the High Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Qian Zhongdao, 50 years old, a native of Ningbo, has been practicing law in this city. After the victory, he was reported by the lawyer's anti-traitor group, alleging that Qian had successively served as the director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, the secretary of the puppet Municipal Administration, and the chief advisor of the puppet Stamp Tax Bureau during the Anti-Japanese War. He was also hired by the puppet court to take over the Shanghai Bar Association. The case has been investigated and concluded by the High Prosecutor's Office and has been formally indicted. Qian is now detained in the Shanghai Prison.</p>
<p>Ma Wenlin, 45 years old, a native of Henan. After the victory, he was reported as being suspected of being a traitor. He was granted bail during the investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office. When Chang Mabu returned to the prison, his relatives set off firecrackers in front of the door to show their welcome. The prosecutor saw this and re-detained Ma for investigation. A public prosecution was filed recently. The indictment alleges that Ma colluded with the enemy military police Kubota, served as the intelligence director in that team, provided intelligence, and also served as the liaison director of the "East Asia Alliance," and opened gambling houses to extract commissions.</p>
<h3>Wang Yanfu Assisted the Enemy in Implementing the Poisoning Policy</h3>
<p>Wang Yanfu was engaged in the opium business. He was accused of running the Yuan Tai Tu Hang for the enemy puppets in 1931, when the enemy puppets occupied Shanghai and were in charge of opium. It was located in Yan Hai Lane, Nine Mu Block, Nanshi, and was dedicated to handling opium registration and allocation for the enemy puppets, promoting the enemy's poisoning policy. When the High Court opened the trial yesterday, the defendant only admitted to working as a Yuan Tai Tu Hang employee but resigned immediately. Therefore, the facts stated in the indictment are all fabricated, he said. The case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>The cases of Zhang Suxing, the director of the puppet Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau Nanshi Inspection Office, which was remanded for retrial, and Chuan Guangyao, the merchant who purchased copper coins for melting and aided the enemy, were inquired yesterday afternoon and both were detained pending another hearing.</p>
<h3>Thugs Indicted in Extortion Case of Yuan Xuefen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of the Yue opera actress Yuan Xuefen being intimidated and defrauded has been investigated and concluded by the local court prosecutor's office.

<h3>Suspicion of Theft of Materials on Fuxing Island: Local Prosecutor's Office Sends Letter to General Assistance for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is said that before the victory, the Japanese army hid materials worth hundreds of billions of yuan in underground tunnels on Fuxing Island in Wusong Town. The tunnels were later discovered by the General Administration of Agricultural Committee when building livestock houses on the island, but all the original hidden materials were gone. The staff of the association did not report to their superiors when they were found, so they were secretly reported and accused to the Cleaning Team, saying that the staff of the association were suspected of embezzling the materials. The case was transferred to the local prosecutor's office by the Cleaning Team, and prosecutor Gu Hongbiao is investigating. Because the circumstances are complicated and bizarre, he has sent a letter to the General Administration requesting assistance in investigating the truth of the case. He also summoned the original secret reporter to court for questioning on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Welfare Soy Sauce Factory Forged Account Books to Evade National Taxes</h3>
<p>Factory Owner Gui Zuren Detained, Accountant Allowed to Provide Written Guarantee</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Gui Zuren, the factory owner of the Welfare Soy Sauce Factory located at the intersection of Zhonghua New Road and Baochang Road in this city, was reported by his business director, Jiao Rongjun, for forging account books in an attempt to evade national taxes and reduce employee bonuses. The district court held a hearing yesterday. Based on calculations from the three genuine account books seized, covering the period from August 10th to the 20th, the factory's business revenue for those ten days amounted to 7,750,950 yuan, while the forged account books showed only 2,053,400 yuan. From this, it was inferred that the amount of evaded national taxes must be substantial. Therefore, Gui Zuren was immediately detained in court. The second defendant, the factory's accountant surnamed He, was allowed to provide a written guarantee and will be interrogated again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Four War Criminals Identified, Military Tribunal Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The four Japanese war criminals identified by comrades who suffered during the War of Resistance against Japan, namely Kanzaburo Sugawara, Masuhiro Hirara, Daizo Nitta, and Sadakichi Numano, have been thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal, and a public prosecution was filed yesterday. The four defendants were formerly chiefs and sergeants of the Japanese military police in the western part of Shanghai. On April 10, 1945, Yu Peng, an intelligence officer of our underground work, was arrested by the enemy in Qingpu and sent to the Shanghai West Military Police Team. The defendants used torture to extract information and sent him to the military court for sentencing. After the victory, the defendants were detained by the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense. Not long ago, Yu Peng went to identify them.</p>

The relevant department of the police bureau has been actively registering households and issuing foreign resident certificates for several months, and two-thirds of the process has been completed. In addition to those who have been repatriated, there are still approximately 1,000 Koreans remaining in Shanghai. The management of Koreans is slightly different from that of other foreigners. Their household registration was originally handled directly by the police bureau, but after consultations between the Korean delegation and our government, the process was changed to require the delegation to conduct a general registration first, then forward it to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then to the police bureau. This involves more steps. Therefore, as of now, the police bureau has issued residency certificates to only over 200 Koreans.</p>
<h3>Spanish Jai Alai Players in Shanghai Find New Outlets: New Courts Being Established in the United States Recruit in Shanghai; Many Have Accepted and Gone to the United States to Showcase Their Skills</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Among the Spanish expatriates in Shanghai, there are a number of former jai alai players. Since the jai alai courts were banned from operating, these individuals have lost their livelihoods and are in dire straits. These players used to have high incomes and extravagant lifestyles. Now that they have lost their jobs, many are at a loss. Some have turned to brokerage and other occupations to make a living, but most are even struggling to make ends meet. However, it has recently been learned that they have found new outlets. A large jai alai court has recently opened in Miami, USA, and is recruiting a large number of players. As a result, many of them have received employment contracts and are preparing to go to the United States to showcase their skills. Heroes finally have a place to use their talents. The total number of Spanish expatriates currently in Shanghai is over 400, mostly engaged in business.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Repairs Police Bells, Charging Each Household 20,000</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Police Bureau held a Police Bell Promotion Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Fang Zhichao, the director of the bureau's administrative department. The following resolutions were made: (1) The police bells installed in Huangpu District have become ineffective after prolonged exposure to wind and rain and must be repaired urgently. The total cost is estimated to be over 24 million yuan. It was decided that each household that originally had a police bell installed will pay 20,000 yuan. The committee members of each trade association will take turns sending two representatives to collect the fees together with personnel dispatched by the local police bureau. (2) As the winter defense season is approaching, the installation of police bells in the Lao Zha District is of utmost importance. It was resolved that the municipal council should first notify the member stores of each trade association to undertake the installation. At the same time, the municipal government should instruct the district baojia chiefs to encourage all merchants to install the devices. The required cost will depend on the number of households installing them and the effort is being actively promoted.</p>

<h3>A Former Enemy Military Police Officer in Jiujiang Who Murdered Our Patriots Was Interrogated by the District Prosecutor's Office Yesterday; He Persistently Denied Knowing Anything</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The former enemy military police officer, Chuyo Masayoshi, was summoned by the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. After the victory, the Jiujiang enemy military police team murdered Hu Congxin, an underground worker, and the owner of a beef shop (whose name is unknown). The War Criminals Management Office entrusted the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate this case. According to Chuyo Masayoshi's testimony yesterday, the two victims had already been detained in the military police team. At that time, he had advocated for their release, but Ogasawara insisted on killing them. However, he himself left Jiujiang afterwards, so he did not know who killed Hu Congxin and the beef shop owner. At the same time, he was unable to confirm that Ogasawara was the killer. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office will notify the War Criminals Management Office to investigate Ogasawara.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis Rampant Since Victory A Year Ago (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Of those examined, only two-fifths had normal hearts and lungs, while 795 people, or 24.65% of the total, suffered from lung diseases, a shockingly high number that broke all previous records of the hospital. The age of tuberculosis patients ranged from one year old to 59 years old, with the highest number being 22 years old, accounting for 54 of the 795 patients. The next highest group was 23 to 26 years old, each accounting for over 40 people. From 18 to 33 years old, the peak period for tuberculosis patients, accounted for a total of 582 people, or slightly less than 73% of the total, indicating that these are the most dangerous years of life. The intensity of the tuberculosis offensive in this city is evident here! It is hoped that all parties will pay close attention and work together to prevent this great threat to the health of the city and the nation from intensifying. At the same time, the masses living in this metropolis should be aware of the lurking dangers of tuberculosis and be prepared for new offensives that may attack our health. Everyone should undergo early check-ups, both to give patients the opportunity for early recovery and to cut off the source of infection, and to enable people to know how to prevent and avoid infection. For the sake of public and personal interests and for the sake of public safety, these wise measures should be taken.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Shando, a UN tuberculosis expert, at a press conference in London, Chinese students have a particularly high rate of tuberculosis, four to five times higher than young adults in other parts of the world, because China has failed to obtain basic sanitary facilities and individual preventative examinations, millions of people will die of tuberculosis. It can be seen that the destruction of youth by tuberculosis is truly alarming. Students are mostly at a dangerous age during their studies and live in a city where tuberculosis is rampant. If they do not have check-ups early, not only will their lung health be unknown, but those with latent tuberculosis will mistake themselves for being healthy, delay treatment, and make unnecessary sacrifices. Should our young students not be vigilant?</p>
<h3>Reader Consultation: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Mental Disorder</p>
<p>Yang Yihe asks: My daughter is already 30 years old and has not yet married. She suffers from a mental disorder. Every week before her period, she feels a headache. Her words and actions gradually become abnormal. Her liver fire rises. When her period arrives, she enters a comatose state, appearing drunk. She does not respond to conversations, but her diet is normal, and her appetite increases. She returns to normal three or four days after her period. Her intellect is clear, and she treats people and handles matters thoroughly. This disease started four years ago when she was teaching at Qixia Elementary School. She then went home to recuperate and did not seek treatment. It took two months for her to recover. Since April of last year, it has been recurring regularly every month. Is this disease related to marriage issues? Is there any special treatment? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] Based on the various symptoms, it appears to be caused by endocrine imbalances. It may be related to marriage issues. You can try using follicular and corpus luteum agents, but it is best to consult with a specialist in gynecology.</p>

<h3>City Council's New Site Issue: Some Councilors Favor Building a New Building</h3>
<p>The City Council decided to purchase the former Japanese Residents Association site on Peng Road from the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for its new location. However, it is currently being leased by the U.S. military for use as a U.S. Sailors' Club. According to various sources, although the lease is about to expire, it is likely to be renewed, and the council will continue to fight for it. Another group of councilors believes that the council urgently needs a fixed location. The reconstruction of the American racecourse is uncertain, and the recovery of the former Japanese Residents Association site is also problematic. They propose to use a vacant lot of approximately eight and four-tenths mu (unit of area) at the corner of Linsen Middle Road and Avenue Road (formerly French Concession) as the site. The building equipment has been well-planned by the previous Provisional Council. The planned site is a two-story building with a capacity of 350 seats downstairs and 250 seats upstairs, along with a conference room, offices, councilor's lounge, library, cloakroom, telephone room, and men's and women's restrooms. The construction cost is estimated to be 950 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Wholesale and Retail Profits are Limited, Cotton Yarn Market Transactions are Sluggish, High-Priced Goods Have to be Shipped and Sold to Other Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After Mayor Wu summoned representatives of yarn merchants the other day and instructed them to strictly abide by the negotiated price trading of cotton yarn, Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the Yarn Merchants Association, notified all members of the association yesterday morning to conscientiously comply. At the same time, the association posted an emergency warning, stating: "Yesterday, we received Mayor Wu's personal instruction: 'Yarn merchants should abide by the price limit of cotton yarn, with a wholesale profit of 5% and a retail profit of 10%, and must not exceed these regulations. Those who violate these rules will be severely punished. You are hereby instructed to inform your colleagues and comply accordingly.' This is an emergency warning, and we hope that everyone will comply." In other words, the price of 20-count yarn should not exceed 1,837,500 yuan for spot transactions on the association's market. However, not only is it difficult for guest merchants to purchase spot goods, but even people in the industry find it difficult to purchase from yarn factories at this price limit. As a result, a stalemate has formed with a lack of transactions. Only 10-count and 16-count yarn have small-scale transactions. As for 20-count yarn and above, because the refunds have not been fully cleared, most of the yarn in the hands of yarn merchants was traded outside the customs for 2 million yuan. It is estimated that the goods with warehouse receipts traded at that price are over 10,000 pieces and are awaiting clearance. As for other spot goods traded outside the customs for 2 million yuan, they can only be shipped and sold to other places. Yarn merchants have indicated that they will abide by the negotiated price trading of cotton yarn in this city from now on. It is also heard that various textile and construction private factories also shipped many pieces of cotton yarn to other places yesterday.</p>
<p>Also, at around 4:00 PM yesterday, Liu Wenteng, the director of the Business Department of the Textile Management Committee, summoned yarn merchant representatives Tang Zhiliang and Zhou Jiasheng to inform them of the various important cases decided by the Textile Management Committee the other day and instructed them to comply. Tang and Zhou proposed two points: (1) The yarn and cloth sold by the Central Trust Bureau as an agent of the government's material sales have always been sold at the highest black market price. Can the premium on this batch of cotton yarn also be refunded? (2) The British-owned Jardine and Lundon factories in this city have always opened yarn at market prices. Can they also be compensated for overpayments and underpayments according to the negotiated prices? It is heard that the Textile Management Committee has not yet considered this, so there was no definite answer, but it was promised that the opinions would be recorded and discussed.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the total monthly yarn production of national and private factories in this city is currently 65,000 pieces. Of this, 36% is allocated to various reproduction industries, 35% is used by yarn factories with weaving machines, 8% is shipped and sold to South China, and 21% is shipped and sold to other places by national and private factories.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Issue: Mayor Wu Convenes Meeting, Prohibits Arbitrary Price Increases, Uniform Distribution Agency to be Established Soon, Loan Issues to be Discussed at Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu, angered by the recent surge in oil prices, convened a discussion meeting with various parties related to edible oil at the municipal government conference room at 2:30 PM yesterday. Those in attendance included Xie Yuxiang, Wang Shuxin, Zhang Derun, Zhang Chao, Ji Mingzhai, Huang Jiaju, and Chuan Changyu. Mayor Wu was extremely angered by the recent sharp rise in oil prices. He earnestly advised the oil merchants that if they had difficulties, they should raise them as much as possible and discuss solutions. If the oil market continues to rise arbitrarily, the authorities will take decisive action. The representatives then presented their opinions. The discussion process and its decisions are recorded as follows: (1) This city needs 36,000 dan of edible oil every month. Of this amount, China Edible Oil Company and China Vegetable Oil Factory will each allocate 10,000 dan. The remaining shortfall will be borne by eight private factories. Zhongshi (China Edible Oil Co.) allocates oil every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Zhongzhi (China Vegetable Oil Factory) allocates oil every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The private factories allocated 720 dan yesterday and will allocate 700 dan every day starting today. All oil allocations from the factories will be based on negotiated prices, namely 98,000 yuan per dan for soybean oil, 99,000 yuan per dan for raw oil, and 92,000 yuan per dan for sesame oil. (2) According to the manufacturers, the cost of oil extraction is 28,000 yuan per dan for soybeans, 3,500 yuan per dan for extraction labor, and each dan can extract 10 jin (Chinese pounds) of oil and 48 jin of soybean cake (equivalent to nine sheets). The problem is that soybean cake is not in season, cannot be sold, and is subject to interest charges. It is hoped that the soybean cake can be shipped to Taiwan. Also, the cost of raw oil from Qingdao also exceeds the current official price. Mayor Wu stated that the 1,500 barrels of raw oil that arrived from Qingdao the other day should still be sold at the official price first, and then a solution would be discussed. (3) The vegetable oil factory intends to request an increase in electricity in order to increase production. Mayor Wu stated that the electricity problem could be resolved by the end of November. (4) The profit margin for wholesale oil merchants was decided to be 3% above the negotiated price. Retail oil merchants have higher costs, so the profit margin is 10% above the negotiated price and must not be exceeded. (5) The city bank will loan 500 million yuan for private oil factories to purchase raw materials. However, the extracted oil should be sold as it is extracted and directly allocated to retailers.</p>
<p>It is heard that the authorities will soon establish a central oil distribution agency to unify the oil distribution process. All oil produced by national and private factories will be centrally allocated by this agency. Mayor Wu will convene representatives from the Central Trust Bureau, the city bank, the Taiwan Trade Company, the Taiwan Sugar Company, and the Oil Extraction Industry Association this afternoon to discuss issues such as loans and the shipment of soybean cake to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The oil market was slightly calmer yesterday. However, merchants from Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Ningbo made substantial purchases, which had an impact on market prices. However, the prices of various edible oils were still lower than the previous day. Raw oil was 120,000 yuan, and soybean oil was 112,000 yuan, both 2,000 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>More Rice Arriving in Market, Japonica and Indica Rice Unchanged</h3>
<p>Over 11,000 shi (unit of volume) of rice arrived in the north and south markets. Stores were still quiet. The north market was firm in the morning and stable in the afternoon, with no changes. The south market continued to decline by 1,000 yuan due to the continuous arrival of goods from the south. High-quality japonica rice in the north was still stable, while indica rice softened. The price of white rice saw little fluctuation, and that of unpolished rice also remained unchanged. A large amount of soybeans arrived in the market, but sales in other places were stagnant. Oil factories had poor demand, and the price fell by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was suspended in Shantou, with no sales, and the price remained flat. The same was true for bran. The flour market was sluggish, declining by 100-200 yuan. Wheat continued to fall by 300-500 yuan. Sesame seeds were popular and dry, rising by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Shandong, Henan, and northern Jiangsu arrived in the market but remained stagnant, falling by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Red beans continued to fall by 2,000-3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Continues to Sell, Gold Price Slightly Lower Than Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold reversed its trend. It opened at around 2.42 million. The central bank continued to exert pressure. Silver shops, due to the proximity of rationing, temporarily adopted a wait-and-see approach. The price soon broke into 2.4 million, falling to 2.38 million before temporarily stabilizing. After 10:00 AM, the central bank sold 60 bars at a price of 2.395 million. Afterwards, investors continued to absorb. The price soon rose again to over 2.4 million. In the afternoon, intraday trading was slightly bullish. After the central bank sold futures as much as possible, the price fell back to under 2.4 million at closing, resulting in a decrease of 18,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments were 254,000, silver remained flat, and silver dollars decreased slightly. Interest rates on the black market were stable, remaining at around 1.5 jiao (unit of currency).</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were stable. The black market price of U.S. dollars was around 4,100-4,150 yuan, the same as the previous day. Hong Kong dollars also hovered around the previous price, resulting in the same as the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained weak due to sluggish sales, with no demand. It was sold at 870 yuan yesterday. The Indian exchange rate was 1,055 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 14,100 yuan, all selling prices. There were even fewer transactions. The official U.S. exchange rate remained stagnant with no transactions.</p>
<h3>Issue of Japanese Cocoon Imports into China: Center of Gravity Has Shifted From Tokyo to Washington</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Negotiations for the import of Japanese cocoons into China have been transferred to the State Department because MacArthur's headquarters believes that the matter is related to the U.S. national economy and should not be decided by the headquarters. Therefore, the focus of the negotiations has shifted from Tokyo to Washington. The person in charge of the China Silk Corporation visited President Song in Nanjing on Monday to request instructions and returned to Shanghai on Wednesday. In the future, the matter will be directly negotiated by our embassy in the United States with the U.S. government. The representative of the China Silk Corporation in New York will also participate when external assistance is needed for consultation. Relevant sources told reporters that the outcome of the negotiations is difficult to predict, and our country will do its best. However, two facts should be noted: First, the United States has a fixed policy of supporting the Japanese silk industry, and large-scale Japanese cocoon imports into China are contrary to this policy. Second, if Japanese cocoons are used to supply our country's silk weaving industry, the quality of the products will be inferior to that of Japanese products, which does not meet the needs of the United States. At the same time, the market for our country's silk is not limited to the United States now or in the future. Therefore, for the United States, it is certainly not as easy to control as Japanese silk. When asked if our country's manufacturers are already feeling a shortage of raw silk, the answer was that there are factories lacking silk, but the situation is not serious for the entire industry.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Delivery Again, Chinese Stocks Change From Weak to Stable</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market was volatile yesterday. The short sellers were nervous because borrowing goods was difficult. No. 176 sold in large quantities, the price went up and then came back down, and the situation was unstable. The market opened with generally weak stocks. After opening, the prices went down slightly. Maintained at low prices by No. 171, No. 232, etc. They gradually improved. The surface changed from short to long, and the outside market also began to squeeze the shorts. Soon, a buying spree began, and Yong Yarn returned above the 600 yuan level. After the high point, it gradually hovered and then returned within the level. No. 176 repeatedly sold Yong Yarn and Xinhe, and the surface gradually loosened. No. 198 also sold, and it gradually weakened. There was no such thing as No. 176, and the retail investors were unstable, and there were more and more cuts. Near noon, there were low prices. After 11:15, there was replenishment outside the market, and No. 232 continued to absorb. The noon closing showed a circling pattern. Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly compared to the previous closing, and Meiya, Xinhe, and Qinxing rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, the ups and downs varied. In the afternoon, the market was enthusiastic because of the intraweek delivery. In addition, there was talk that "delivery" could be implemented next Wednesday. The shares once rebounded, but No. 198 and short selling outside the market were not completely wiped out and were unable to rise further. Finally, due to the gathering of retail sales, they fell again. Near the closing, they gradually stabilized. As a result, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly compared to the previous closing, while Meiya, Xinhe, and Qinxing rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, Jin Silk fell to a standstill, Wuhe fell by more than 10%, and the rest saw slight ups and downs. The total transaction volume was 12.46 million shares, and the stocks outside the market also fell again.</p>
<p>There were still many sellers of foreign stocks, and the buyers were watching from the sidelines. There were not many transactions. Paper was almost on the market but not sold. Wheelock was still stable, while the rest weakened due to multiple settlements. As a result, Industry Wide and Wheelock were stable compared to the previous closing, Jardine and British-American Yarn fell slightly, and the rest fell by about half a percent.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Sales Gradually Active</h3>
<p>The cloth market showed a slight upward trend. Due to the welcome activities for Japanese sales, Tianjin merchants absorbed a huge amount. General observations show a thriving trend. However, the rise was not strong due to large-scale sales by textile companies. The leading fine cloth in the market opened at 83,000 yuan yesterday. The Four Gentlemen old-fashioned serge cloth was 94,000 yuan. However, the Changzhou goods rose sharply by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The Jia Guan fine cloth rose by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous low price, with a shout of 69,000 yuan. The Elephant Head shouted 72,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Melton at Wholesale Prices</h3>
<p>American Melton cloth, currently holding a very important position among woolen fabrics, enjoys robust and unparalleled market demand. Wholesale transactions within the industry, aside from direct orders from foreign firms, offer little profit. Commission for brokers typically ranges from only one to two hundred or fifty yuan per yard. Due to the high volume of transactions and strong demand, all transactions must be conducted in cash. Industry insiders thus refer to it as "gold bars," signifying its immediate convertibility. However, the abundant market supply keeps prices consistently moderate. White-edged cloth was sold for 33,000 yuan yesterday, pink-edged for 32,000 yuan, and natural-colored for 31,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reliance on Old Iron Due to Limited Supply of Pig Iron - Destruction of Ma'anshan Mine and Scarcity of American Goods - Market Prices Rise with Difficulties in Rationing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] The pig iron market has recently become lively due to the scarcity of incoming goods and the extremely thin reserves in the city. The price of new pig iron is between 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan per ton, while old pig iron also reaches 1 million yuan per ton. Before May, the price of both new and old pig iron was only around 300,000 yuan per ton. According to a responsible person from the Iron Industry Association speaking to our reporter, the main source of domestic pig iron is the iron mine in Ma'anshan, Jiujiang. The mine has abundant reserves but has been damaged by the war and cannot provide normal supplies for the time being. Otherwise, its production could have met the national consumption needs with surplus. After the victory, the main source of new pig iron in this city was mostly from orders placed in America. However, the US export licenses for pig iron are intermittently issued, resulting in a very limited supply. In total, only about five to six thousand tons of pig iron have been shipped from the US since the victory. Currently, in addition to placing orders in America, pig iron merchants occasionally initiate orders from Hong Kong, where the pig iron mainly comes from Britain and India. Currently, due to the shortage of pig iron in the city, the iron merchants mainly rely on searching and purchasing old pig iron from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou to meet the demand. Although there have been requests for pig iron rationing, the possibility seems extremely slim.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Rebounds Midway</h3>
<p>Government bonds gradually stabilized yesterday. Unified Class C bonds opened at 1,180 yuan in the morning, offered by Fuyuan and others. Large investors such as Siqi and Qilou were quite interested, causing the price to initially drop to 1,140 yuan. However, it rebounded to around 1,350 yuan midway, fluctuating between 1,310 yuan and 1,340 yuan at noon. As a result, the closing price was 100 yuan higher for Class A, unchanged for Class B, 80 yuan higher for Class C, 110 yuan higher for Class D, and 90 yuan higher for Class E compared to the previous day's close.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Declines Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters New York, 7th] Today in the New York cotton market, due to strong selling pressure, prices opened lower, with all grades falling to the 200-point limit. Subsequently, due to buying from yarn factories, prices rebounded by 100 points. Later, due to wavering trends in foreign forward letters of credit and other agricultural policies of the Republican Party, renewed selling was triggered, causing market prices to decline again. Prices stabilized slightly at the end, resulting in a drop of 134 points to 198 points. The estimated total trading volume for the day was 600,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Export Allocation - China Receives 65,000 Bales</h3>

<h3>Zang Qifang Arrives in Nanjing to Discuss Impressions After Inspecting Education in the Northeast - The Japanese Did Not Succeed in Their Enslavement Education in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 8th] Zang Qifang, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education in the Northeast, recently came to Nanjing for official business. He told reporters about his impressions of inspecting education in the Northeast, stating: The Japanese did not succeed in their enslavement education in the Northeast. The more they oppressed, the greater the resistance of the youth. Therefore, the patriotic sentiment of the Northeast youth is definitely not inferior to that of the inland youth. However, the Japanese policy of educating the people in ignorance in the Northeast has had a considerable impact. The enemy and puppets in the Northeast focused on practical sciences, such as agriculture, industry, and medicine, and did not pay attention to liberal arts. It can be said that the enemy only focused on skills and did not focus on academics. They did not want the Chinese people to have patriotic ideas. Therefore, regarding the education of Northeast youth, it is not as important to focus on history and geography knowledge to inspire their patriotism as it is to focus on liberal arts to cultivate their thinking ability and awaken their spontaneous spirit.</p>
<h3>Academic Awards for the 35th and 36th Years - Applications to Begin on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing] The Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education held its 16th regular meeting of the 2nd session on the 6th, approving the qualifications of teachers above the college level and deciding that the academic awards for the 35th and 36th years will be held jointly. This was reported in this newspaper on the 7th. According to Zhao Shanji, the chief secretary of the committee, the Ministry of Education's academic awards for the 34th year received more than 150 applications from the domestic academic community regarding "writings," "inventions," and "art." Because it was the time of victory in the Anti-Japanese War and repatriation, the expert review committee members were mostly in various places, busy with repatriation, so the conclusion was later due to various transportation reasons. It is estimated that the review meeting can be held within December of this year to determine the amount of the awards. The amount of the awards was originally set at 100,000 yuan for the first prize, 60,000 yuan for the second prize, and 30,000 yuan for the third prize, as well as the winners. The academic awards for the 35th and 36th years will be held jointly. The application period is set from December 1 of this year to the end of June next year. All domestic academic works related to "writings," "inventions," and "art" can be submitted for review within this six-month period. The Ministry of Education will draft application procedures and announce them to the domestic academic community for application in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3>Yuan Tongli Returns to Beiping to Discuss His Overseas Mission</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 7th] Yuan Tongli, director of the National Beiping Library, returned to Beiping and discussed his overseas mission, which was (1) to go to Europe and the United States to collect books for research institutions in domestic universities, according to the government's order.

(2) to go to Germany to investigate Chinese cultural relics. Previously, it was said by the Germans that the Chinese cultural relics in Germany had all been destroyed by bombing, but Yuan's investigation proved that it was the German's nonsense. Among the important ones, there are many murals robbed from Turpan, Xinjiang in 1904, which can be retrieved through diplomatic means. (3) to participate in the Paris Peace Conference as a Chinese consultant, specializing in collecting two boxes of information from various countries.

All schools storing funds in Xinhua Bank can go to the bank's office at 500 Linsen Middle Road to receive them back, and schools storing funds in Guohua Bank can go to the head office at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road to receive them back. The schools are required to refund the funds to the students within three days after receiving them back.</p>

<h3>Football Friendly Match - Railway Triumphs Yesterday</h3>
<p>2-1 Victory Over British Navy</p>
<p>In the football friendly match, the Railway team played against the British Navy yesterday afternoon at 3:30 at Jinyuan Park. The Railway team had Han Longhai, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, and Fei Chunhua playing, and their momentum was very strong. After two defeats, the British Navy had adjusted its lineup and its skills were gradually becoming more refined. The two sides played a close match and the competition was quite fierce. As a result, the Railway team defeated the British Navy 2-1.</p>
<p>After the contact, the Railway's attack was blocked, and the British army launched a counterattack. Betz broke through the center and opened the scoring first. After losing a city, the whole army rose up. In the middle, Zhuan Longhai rushed up and headed the ball, and the ball bounced back off Hohut, hitting Xiao Ziwen who was waiting in the right position, and he pushed it into the empty goal, making it a 1-1 tie. Fei Chunhua continued to work hard, Hohut failed to catch the ball, and Xiao Fei lifted his foot and hooked the ball, and the ball flew into the net. After that, the two sides were in a stalemate, and the Railway team took the lead with a score of 2-1, ending the first half. In the second half, the four knights of the Railway team, Han, Zhang, Li, and Fei, retired, and alternative troops were dispatched to replace them. The situation of the two teams became more balanced. At 15 minutes, Daonalai scored a goal, but it was rejected for offside. After that, neither side made any progress, and the game ended hastily. As a result, the Railway team defeated the British Navy 2-1.</p>

<h3>Football Players' Out-of-Bounds Behavior - Football Committee Rectifies Discipline - Sends Letters to Teams Asking for Attention to Restraint</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Football Committee, in view of the recent accidents on the football field and the out-of-bounds behavior of many players, which is contrary to sportsmanship, sent a letter to all member teams yesterday, urging them to maintain discipline. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, Only two weeks after the start of this year's league, players' actions have been rough, their behavior has been undisciplined, or they have ignored the referees in various competitions. These bad phenomena are obstacles to the future of sports and are deeply regrettable. The purpose of participating in the competition is to seek progress in sports and to connect feelings. Since it is a competition, winning or losing is inevitable and not worth much. The actions of the players on the field are responsible for the reputation of the club and themselves. Being unruly and undisciplined is enough to cause ignorant spectators to follow suit and create disputes on the field. It is contrary to the purpose and loses morality. The responsibility of this committee is to do its best to rectify it. In addition to appealing to the press, referee associations, and police authorities to assist in correcting this situation, we are sending this letter to you, hoping that you will uphold the purpose of improving amateur sports, exhort your players to restrain the team, and prevent them from being indulgent, so as to maintain discipline together. Shanghai Sports Association Football Committee."</p>

<h3>Gu Yuxiu Went to Beijing Last Night - Describing the Experience of Overseas Inspection Before Departure</h3>
<p>Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, was ordered to go to Europe in early August of this year to attend the International Scientific Conference. He has completed his official duties and returned to China from the United States on November 1. He arrived at Longhua Airport at 6:30 PM the day before yesterday (7th). The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is reported that Gu went to Beijing last night to visit Minister Zhu and report on his trip to Europe. He will report to the National Congress on the 11th. Before leaving, Gu briefly described the general situation of the overseas inspection to reporters as follows: After departing from Shanghai, he first went to the western United States and visited the University of California (Atomic Energy Research Center) and the California Institute of Technology (Scientific Research Atomic Energy, Radar, Aviation), all of which were large in scale. Then he went to Switzerland, where he was invited to participate in the 300th anniversary of the Swiss Science Conference. Those who were invited to participate were the former President of the British Royal Society, the President of the University of Paris, and I, representing the President of the National Central University. The mood was warm and I was excited. I was also received by the President of Switzerland to discuss scientific issues between the two countries. Then I went to Paris to attend the International Scientific Conference and the International Applied Mechanics Conference. After the meeting, I stayed at Oxford University in London, England, and visited the vice presidents and deans of various colleges to study academics, and visited Cambridge University. Before leaving, I paid a special visit to the 90-year-old writer Bernard Shaw to pay my respects, and then packed up and took a flying boat from London, passing through Egypt, Cairo, Calcutta, and Hong Kong before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>To Mr. Mao Zedong, A Frank Letter</h3>
<p>— Advisor, Zhu Yaotian (Part 1)</p>
<p>Mr. Zedong:</p>
<p>Originally, I intended to go to Yan'an, but due to transportation difficulties, I stopped in _____. Over the past year, apart from receiving permission from your senior cadres to use the name "_____" in _____, I also engaged in two commercial ventures myself: one was the National Grand Theater in _____, and the other was the _____ Antiquities Gallery, dealing in ancient and modern cultural relics. Seeing this, you might say, "Another selfish fellow!" But you might not believe it: if I hadn't engaged in these two commercial ventures, in the "Liberated Zone" where "entry is allowed but exit is not," I would have had absolutely no way to get out. For my own freedom, and for the freedom of many friends who walked down a dead end because of "hearing people say," I had no choice but to do this. In fact, I had to do it. I hope you'll show some mercy in your words!</p>
<p>Participated in Hundreds of Gatherings and Visits</p>
<p>During this year, in my capacity as an advisor, I participated in dozens of large and small gatherings in Central China, and personally made hundreds of visits to various parties. Because of my businessman's guise, I received heartfelt disclosures from all sides. I firmly believe that these are more genuine and reliable than the comrades you send who eat public rations and wear public uniforms. Originally, I planned to publish a critical journal, using the titles you gave me, such as "democratic personage" and "progressive element," publishing articles according to the severity of the matter on a regular basis. However, in the "Liberated Zone" where freedom of speech is absolutely forbidden, one can only keep words deep in one's belly. Otherwise, a warning is a small matter; if one is labeled a "special agent," then only heaven knows what will happen!</p>
<p>I left Huaiyin on the morning of August 17th and only arrived in Shanghai in early September. Because I had tasted the bitterness of the difficult roads in the "Liberated Zone," I felt rather unwell after returning. Therefore, this "frank letter" that I had long wanted to write to you is only being written today. Before getting to the main topic, it seems I should make a statement to you to avoid misunderstandings. I am a person who has dedicated my life to cultural and educational endeavors. I have never participated in any political party, and I am certainly not the "special agent" that your cadres constantly talk about. At the same time, I am also confident that I am neither the "stubborn element" you constantly mention, nor the "reactionary" you shout about in your dreams. I am taking a stand as a pure Chinese cultural figure, saying what a Chinese cultural figure should say. If you truly practice "the speaker is not to be blamed, but the listener should take it as a warning," then this "frank letter" of mine will not only be beneficial to the general intellectuals and semi-intellectuals who "hear people say," but also to the future of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Let's start with theory. Never Produced, Yet Revolting Against Others</p>
<p>I think the sole viewpoint of Mr. Marx in writing the doctrine of communism should be the word "exploitation," and the formation of the state of "exploitation" should be the word "production," and the bearers of the word "production" should be the genuine workers and farmers. That is to say, the blood and sweat earnings of a worker or farmer are "exploited" by a non-worker or non-farmer, creating a phenomenon where the producer is starving and freezing, while the non-producer, the "exploiter," is well-fed and warmly clothed. The result of this phenomenon expanding is the formation of class antagonism, which leads to class struggle, which leads to socialist revolution, and then to communist revolution. If my statement is correct, then the prerequisite for a revolutionary should be a genuine producer with absolute nature. Otherwise, there would be no formation of "exploitation," no formation of class antagonism, no class struggle, and of course, no socialist revolution or communist revolution. If someone has always been a non-working, non-farming, free-loader, that is, someone who has never produced, I think that kind of person is only qualified for others to revolt against him, and is absolutely not qualified to revolt against others. However, the Chinese Bolsheviks you lead seem to have not paid attention to this point.</p>
<p>Let's take a typical example. Eating Public Rations, Wearing Public Uniforms: Who Is Exploiting Whom?</p>
<p>How many of the senior cadres under Mr. Mao are production elements who came from worker or peasant backgrounds? If they are not production elements who came from worker or peasant backgrounds, then eating their fill of the public rations of good, honest people and wearing the public uniforms of good, honest people, they swagger around shouting the slogan "Those who obey me prosper, those who resist me perish" and start a revolution. Who is "exploiting" whom here? I think that apart from the saying "revolution is a newly emerging profession in modern times," I really can't find a second explanation. As for the "New Democracy" you crafted, which is neither rent reduction nor interest reduction, it has already become a 100%, 1000% empty signboard for your cadres at all levels to use in external speeches! In fact, you have not implemented even half of it, so I cannot bear to say it, and I need not say it!</p>
<p>Suwan Border Region Postage Stamps (Sent by Wang Hanou)</p>
<p>Let's talk about party affairs again. "I'm the Greatest Under Heaven," "Today's Weather, Haha!"</p>
<p>"Firm belief" internally and "penetrating thinking" externally: this is the central task of the Chinese Communist Party under your leadership for its internal and external work. The senior cadres responsible for this central task are selected from those who have working ability ("talent"), are absolutely selfless ("virtue"), and have been party members for a long time ("seniority"). One cannot say that this method is not thorough, but in terms of results, it produces many problems. The result of "firm belief" among party members at all levels is mostly the problem of "I'm the greatest under heaven," and the ending of "penetrating thinking" almost 100% becomes the façade of "today's weather, haha!" Because the words and deeds of people within the party have already become 100% "I'm the greatest under heaven," people outside the party have to be sensible, and everyone unanimously says "You're the best" and "He's no good." Under the smiling circumstances, this great historical task is completed satisfactorily. As for the standards of "talent, virtue, and seniority," in fact, it should be said that "seniority comes first, talent and virtue come second," because I have personally seen that the old cadres who participated in the Long March, that is, the people who moved from Jiangxi to Shaanxi, are now all remarkable figures. Whether they all possess the conditions of "talent" and "virtue," please look at the ironclad facts below.</p>
<p>Let's give a few typical examples. The Most Wonderful Talks of Long March-Era Cadres</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Yang in the Central China Military Region. He is an old cadre who participated in the Long March. He told me twice that he has a younger brother who was adopted by his three uncles, what is commonly called "one son for three houses." During the War of Resistance, this younger brother of his was the county magistrate of Zhengyangguan. Mr. Yang's most wonderful quote is this: "Damn it! He works for the Kuomintang, I work for the Communist Party. One day I'll take a short gun, and I'll shoot him, damn it. He ran in front, I chased behind, chasing for more than ten miles in one breath. Damn this dog, he jumped into the river. I don't know how to swim, otherwise, I would have killed him that day..." This fact can be considered a typical example of "firm belief" within the party.</p>
<p>The host of the Central China Journalism College is Mr. Fan Changjiang, who is now in the Nanjing CCP delegation. In order to penetrate the thinking of all the students, the school put forward a topic "What is a People's Newspaper?" at the student life review meeting and handed it over to the student life review meeting for review. It was reviewed for a whole week, which shows that many students' thinking had not yet been penetrated, because different opinions were put forward. While this was not being decided, several students whom I had taught before came to chat at my place. I knew they had changed as individuals. They were all powerful figures who had raised different opinions. At that time, I said to them, "Why bother? A wise man doesn't suffer immediate losses. As long as you can say 'The best' and 'No good,' can't any problem be solved?" Two days later, they came again, and the correct conclusion of "What is a People's Newspaper?" was also passed. This great historical document, like the red characters "Leader of the Chinese People, Mao Zedong" next to your several-meter-high portrait on the walls of various cities in the "Liberated Zone," the original text is "Only the Communist Party's newspaper is a people's newspaper." This fact can be considered a typical example of your "penetrating thinking" of people outside the party.</p>
<p>Zhang, the regimental commander who now works on special tasks in the Central China Military Region, came from the Green Forest bandits in Taihu Lake. In order to show his personal "virtue" to the party, he has donated all his fields. But on the other hand, he opened two distilleries of kaoliang liquor that the common people are not allowed to build, and Commander Zhang builds them in large quantities. In addition, he bought several boats and houses. I personally saw that he has two wives. There are often opium pipes openly displayed in the mansion, and the orderlies are lined up. When he speaks, the arrogance of "I'm the greatest under heaven" seems to surpass that of General Zhang Zongchang, the long-legged general of many years. This fact can be considered a typical example of a Communist Party member's "talent" and "virtue."</p>
<p>Let's talk about politics again.</p>
<p>An American Colonel Is Not as Smart as the Communists</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the situation of your two-faced politics, let's first cite a fact as the basis of "New Democracy" on the outside and "Communism" on the inside. The matter is like this: This spring, Mr. Tan Zhenlin, the political commissar of the Central China Military Region, said at a representative conference, "Colonel A of the US Executive Group said to me, 'Your various base brigades are very good, but there is one thing I disagree with: you are now implementing "New Democracy," which is rent reduction and interest reduction, and is not communism. You are targeting farmers. You should change your name to Farmers' Party, or the Farmer-Worker Party, or the Socialist Party, or the Progressive Party, etc. Why must you call yourselves the Communist Party, which scares people?'" As soon as Mr. Tan finished speaking, all the representatives burst into laughter at the same time. At this time, Mr. Tan and many senior cadres on the stage were also laughing heartily. From this everyone's laughter, it is very clear that this American colonel is not as smart as you. He can only see one side of your two-faced politics. Naturally, the general Chinese people may not even see one side, so the "rent reduction and interest reduction" of "New Democracy" has actually become the "confiscation of property" of "Communism"! A hero does things like a hero should. I tend to agree with that. You now feel that "liquidation" and "struggle" are a bit too troublesome. It is better to simply have a "land donation," which is actually "land distribution." The Communist Party talks about communism, which should be reasonable in theory, but is it allowed in the real environment of China? Do the political work cadres of the Communist Party possess the conditions that party members should have? Are the old people in Chinese rural areas happy to accept it? In the "Liberated Zone" that has undergone "accounting" and "struggle" and "land donation," with everything returning to a primitive state, can it survive freely in the international community of the 20th century? These real-world problems can be answered by the following facts, and I also ask you to answer them.</p>
<p>Let's give a few typical examples. Holding a Tenant's Waist, Forcing Him to "Turn Over"</p>
<p>First, let's talk about "rent reduction" and "land donation." The 25% rent reduction mostly starts from the 25th year of the Republic (1936). I personally saw your cadres forcibly holding the tenants' waists, ordering them to "turn over." Thus, the tenant's whole family lined up. In front, cheerleaders beat gongs and drums; behind, hangers-on carried bamboo baskets. Amid shouts of "Long live the Communist Party," the landlord was carried to the "town government." The result of settling accounts for ten years of 25% rent reduction is that selling all the land is not enough to refund the expenses of ten years of 25% rent reduction. In the end, one can only say nice words and "donate" all the land to finish the matter. This was the old method before this summer. After this summer, they simply "put away" the "New Democracy" side of the two-faced politics, that is, the "25% rent reduction" side, in silence. The remaining side, although there is also the saying "those who till the land own the land," in fact, it has thoroughly implemented the "land distribution" of communism.</p>
<p>What is the situation in your "Liberated Zone" after "land distribution"? Perhaps the report you receive must be the word "very good"? But in my eyes, there are many serious problems. As long as you and your many cadres, no, it should be said that the universal cadres, do not have the same "revolution is to overcome all difficulties, because there are difficulties, so revolution is needed, as long as you are willing to be revolutionary, as long as you are constantly revolutionary, no matter failure or death are successful." "I'm the greatest under heaven" mentality, then this ironclad fact cannot but be paid attention to. The fact is this:</p>
<p>Your "land distribution" method takes the village as a unit. It's not about how many people there are in the village, how much land there is, adding up the number of people and the amount of land, and then "distributing land according to population." According to the general situation of each village, rich peasants are the fewest, poor peasants are the second fewest, and middle peasants account for the majority. For example, a middle peasant who has twenty mu of land has a family of five. According to the total number of fields in this village, each person can be divided into three mu, and a family of five can only be divided into fifteen mu. The remaining five mu are taken away by the so-called poor peasants for nothing. Think about it, will this self-cultivating farmer, who has absolute productivity in the village, be lazy from now on? And yesterday, they sold their land and made trouble, and today they took it back for nothing. The village ruffians, that is, what you call "good-for-nothings," because they can't produce, they sold their family property. Now they have got extra money, and they are the same as the self-cultivating farmers who have been bleeding and sweating for years. That is to say, yesterday he squandered the money from selling the land, and the money has not been spent today, and the sold land has flown back. The most wonderful thing is that these bad guys are mostly assigned by your cadres to be something like village chiefs and something like members. Under the new situation of gaining both fame and fortune, they grab the pigtails of the rich peasants with both hands and ride on the shoulders of the middle peasants. They also strut around the countryside as revolutionaries. Thus, the middle peasants and rich peasants are secretly killing plowing cattle, destroying farm implements, and dismantling waterwheels and carts. In the countryside, there is already a feeling of insufficient farm implements. Although it has not yet reached the point of completely getting rid of them, at least they are becoming increasingly scarce. May I ask, Mr. Mao, what will you use to drive the "Great Production Movement" you are calling for?</p>
<p>The True Face of "Struggle"</p>
<p>In the "Anti-Traitor Struggle", a Five-Act Play Was Performed Continuously</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the "struggle" of "Those with money are all bad guys, those with no money are all good people." Mr. Liu, the vice chairman of your "Suwan Border Region Government," said at a conference, "In the countryside, use settling accounts to achieve the goal of fundamentally turning the masses over; in the city, use anti-traitors and anti-evil bullies to achieve the goal of fundamentally turning the masses against feudalism..." This statement was made during the period when you were greatly talking about "New Democracy" externally, so the four words "basic masses" are used to represent the term "proletariat." Now you are thoroughly engaged in the "land revolution" in the countryside, and naturally you have to thoroughly engage in anti-feudalism in the city! The following facts, although they are "yesterday's news," can still be used as a reference for your thorough governance. The matter is like this:</p>
<p>In Huaiyin Central Street, there is a Xu Jiucheng who runs a tea and snack shop. His family has a mother in her seventies, as well as a wife and a daughter. In addition, there are two shop assistants. During the enemy-puppet period, there was a "Second Emperor" battalion commander who forcibly stored six boxes in Xu's shop. After you "liberated" Huaiyin, this "Second Emperor" battalion commander was captured, and the six boxes were also carried away by someone sent by your New Fourth Army regimental commander. This happened last autumn. This spring, the urban anti-feudal "struggle" began. Thus, several basic masses who were eating and drinking saw that Xu Jiucheng had a house and a tea and snack shop, so they turned their minds to "struggling" against him. Several bad guys said it, and the struggle committee member listened, and the case was considered established. Thus, a large group of basic masses beating gongs and drums came to Xu Jiucheng's door. In the lyrics that were sung after the gongs and drums stopped, the main ones were these two sentences: "Xu Jiucheng is a traitor, quickly hand over the six boxes!" Perhaps Xu Jiucheng's life should not have ended. When your New Fourth Army regimental commander sent someone to carry the boxes, there was a porter who led the way, and he knew Xu Jiucheng. After repeated requests, the porter of the Jiangbei Hotel finally spread the word. This porter had a great sense of justice. He explained on the spot the situation of the New Fourth Army regimental commander living in his shop and the process of sending someone to carry the six boxes. Not only was he willing to testify orally, but he was even willing to testify in writing. At this point, the group of basic masses who had changed their minds were all speechless to each other. At this time, your "instructor," in announcing Xu Jiucheng's innocence, ended the first act of the "anti-traitor struggle."</p>
<p>Then the second act began. The time was that same evening. Two basic masses went to Xu's house. After talking a lot, they forcibly took 300 yuan of "anti-Japanese currency" from Xu Jiucheng (at that time, pork was 4 yuan per pound, so you could buy 70 to 80 pounds). With the assurance that there would be no trouble, the second act was considered finished. The next day, the third act began. Xu Jiucheng was summoned to the "town government" again. Your "instructor's" opening lyrics were "The Jiangbei Hotel porter was someone you spent money to recruit. Now you can only write a 'letter of repentance' and pay a fine to finish the matter..." Then Xu Jiucheng put his fingerprint on the already written "letter of repentance," and he also added his fingerprint to the 3,000 yuan "anti-Japanese currency" fine ticket. With the announcement that it had to be delivered within seven days, the third act closed!</p>
<p>The title of the fourth act was "Mr. and Mrs. Xu's Flight." Because Xu Jiucheng was unwilling to take out the 3,000 yuan fine, and in fact could not take it out, he painfully abandoned his family and fled seven days before the deadline. When the seven days were up, Mrs. Xu was summoned to the "town government." Your "instructor" explained again, "...Seven days have passed, Xu Jiucheng ran away secretly. Now the fine has been doubled. You must hand over 6,000 yuan within three days, otherwise your property will be confiscated..." Amid the "yes, yes, yes" sounds, Mrs. Xu also followed in her husband's footsteps overnight, abandoning her family and fleeing!</p>
<p>In the fifth act, because the male and female protagonists ran away, I automatically participated in the performance, knowing that it was "doing the impossible," The plot is like this:</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the third day, the "town government" sent eight skinny men, who came to Xu's house talking to each other, registering all the belongings on one side, and shouting loudly to the old Mrs. Xu, "Don't move anything, your entire family property will be confiscated tomorrow!" Due to the explanation of a businessman friend, as the eight skinny men were about to leave, I came to Xu's house in person! From the old Mrs. Xu, the businessman friend, and two neighbors, I learned the truth of the matter from beginning to end. Immediately, I volunteered to visit the "instructor" in charge of the "struggle" in the "town government." After expressing my dual advisor status, I had this conversation, "...If Xu Jiucheng should die, then you should have shot him the first time. Why did you announce his innocence the first time, swindle 300 yuan the second time, and then he was guilty the third time, fining him 3,000 yuan, and doubling the fine the fourth time, fining him 6,000 yuan, and confiscating all the property the fifth time? I am a northerner, let me say a northern slang. Are you ever going to be done with it?" Finally, it was transferred from the "town government" to the "district government." Fortunately, it ended without a conclusion. But when I left Jin Yin, Mr. and Mrs. Xu were still guests in other villages.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong (second from left), Mrs. Mao, Ms. Ping, and a reporter from this newspaper (taken in Yan'an in 1945)</p>
<p>A New Page of "Forced Into Liangshan"</p>
<p>All Pawn Tickets Are Invalid, Redeem Items Based on "Conscience"</p>
<p>Let me tell you another "redeeming items based on conscience without pawn tickets" story. Li Yushu, who opened a pawnshop in Huaiyin, was sentenced to life imprisonment by your cadres at a so-called "public trial." A few days later, your civil affairs cadres convened a gathering of "demanding Li Yushu to compensate for losses," that is, a meeting of "redeeming items based on conscience without pawn tickets." Your "instructor's" statement was like this, "...Li Yushu set fire to the pawnshop. Now the government and the masses have sentenced him to life imprisonment and confiscated all his property. In order to take into account the losses of those who pawned things, you can bring it up. As long as everyone is conscientious, pawn tickets are not necessary. My stamp is the same as proof..." Thus, those who had never worn fur coats insisted that they had pawned fur coats, and those who had never worn silk fabrics also insisted that they had pawned silk pants. A seventy-year-old lady who had been chanting Buddha for many years, that is, the old lady who explained this story to me, she was unwilling to obtain this unconscionable wealth. When she replied to me that she had not pawned anything, the village chief nudged her secretly, whispering, "Just write something casually." Finally, the village chief wrote something casually, but this old lady swore to me that she would never want this ill-gotten wealth. However, who is working hard for whom in the end, the tune that is reported and taken down?</p>
<p>Finally, let me tell you one more story about a political deception. Your liaison personnel stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai, in order to show their achievements, in order to receive funds, they often distribute pamphlets, newspapers, magazines, and theoretical books to the prepared revolutionaries who have already made contact, that is, those who "hear people say," and they constantly boast about how good the "Liberated Zone" is, welcoming people outside the "Liberated Zone" to visit, study, and work there. We provide transportation, food, and lodging. If they are willing to stay for study and work, the school will provide food, clothing, housing, and books. There are generous salaries for employment. If they are willing to come back, we will be responsible for sending them back, and so on. Thus, many people, especially young people, under the emotion of "seeking truth" and "upholding justice," are escorted to the "Liberated Zone." In order to illustrate the truth that "escorting" represents "welcoming," let me cite two examples to prove it.</p>
<p>Ten students whom I taught before are now working at the Heping Daily. In June of this year, _____ and three others were welcomed to the "Liberated Zone." I don't know why, this student's thinking is the same as mine, and it has never been penetrated. On the night before he was about to "return to Beijing," no matter what, not only was he not sent off, but he was not even issued a road pass. The next day, I was just about to find a senior cadre to _____ to deal with it, when another student came to tell me that this classmate had set off empty-handed before dawn. As for whether he was able to walk out of the "Liberated Zone," there is still no news to this day.</p>
<p>There was also a classmate who was welcomed to Huaiyin and assigned to work in the "Suwan Border Region Government Public Security Bureau." Because he couldn't live the life of eating public rations, wearing public uniforms, and sleeping alone all day long, he also had the idea of "returning home." After repeated requests for leave were denied, this classmate hung up his public uniform and flattened his seal of office, using the method of "If you don't send me off, I'll leave by force." As a result, he was escorted back when he reached Baoying. Without asking a question, he was imprisoned for more than two months. Later, his wife also came, and that's when he regained his freedom, but with the condition that the two of them could not leave Huaiyin far away. Now Huaiyin has changed, and I don't know where this pair of couples who were "forced into Liangshan" are now wandering!</p>

<p>Let's talk about economics again. "Everything Is for the People," This Statement Is Not Consistent with the Facts</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about your economic theories, and in fact, there is no need to talk about them. Over the past year, from various observations, your true economic policies can be divided into the following two categories:</p>
<p>1. The economy of the Party taking from the people.</p>
<p>2. The economy of the Party distributing to merchants.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the economy of the Party taking from the people. The economy you take from the people has about the following four types:</p>
<p>(1) Collecting public grain</p>
<p>(2) Issuing paper money</p>
<p>(3) Collecting commodity taxes</p>
<p>(4) Confiscating property</p>
<p>According to your statement, the above four economic measures are "all for the people, and the Communist Party members never want a penny."</p>
<p>At present, Communist Party members are less likely to be major corruptors. This is a fact. Whether this is due to the current poor economic environment, although it cannot be confirmed, it is an ironclad fact that petty corruptors are everywhere. In the future, when peace is realized and the economic environment changes, will this petty corruption that is everywhere become bigger or smaller? I think anyone can draw a conclusion on this question.</p>
<p>Perhaps my statement is a bit too subjective? I feel that the saying "everything is for the people" should be changed to "everything is for the Communist Party," and "Communist Party members never want a penny" should also be changed to "Communist Party members never lose a penny." Only in this way can name and reality be consistent. I wonder what Mr. Mao's opinion is!</p>
<p>Let's give some typical examples. In the "Public Trial," the "Struggle" Reached Its Climax</p>
<p>Last winter, Mr. Liu Ruilong, the vice chairman of your "Suwan Border Region Government," was the central figure in charge of all the "struggles" in the "Suwan Border Region." At the largest and most lively so-called "public trial" (the reason for adding the word "so-called" to "public trial" is not that I disagree in principle, but that I feel that you have already privately tried the case beforehand, calculated the shooting on the spot, confiscated the property, and then deliberately came again, see my poem about what I have seen about public trials, the Xiong posture and great theory of Vice Chairman Liu were as follows:</p>
<p>Standing on a platform in the middle of the basic masses who had already been mobilized, he held a cigarette in one hand and raised the other hand over his head, shouting, "Today! Is the day when you old people turn over! Zhou Gongwang (that is, the one who was shot on the spot) forcibly collected twenty-five catties from your fields, forcing you to not be able to live! Today is the time for you to settle your blood debts. Those of you who have grievances, speak up; those of you who have enemies, take revenge..." Then, an old woman who had been arranged in advance walked to Zhou Gongwang, took out a black cake from her arms, and sent it to Zhou Gongwang's mouth, saying, "...You wanted 25 catties from us for every mu of land, forcing us to get sick from eating this thing. Damn you, you give it to us to eat, you give it to us to eat..." This scene was considered the climax of that day's "public trial" and the place where your external propaganda was most vigorous. Now Zhou Gongwang, who collected twenty-five catties per mu, has been shot by you for almost a year, and I don't know where the old woman who got sick from eating the black cake is now wandering. Taking the minimum conscience that human beings should have, the Communist Party's "collection of public grain" should in any case be less than twenty-five catties per mu, but the unexpected thing finally appeared before my eyes. Your cadres in Baoying, Gaoyou, Xinghua and other regions collected more than 30 catties of "public grain" per mu. In addition, several catties of grass were collected per mu. May I ask, Mr. Mao, how should this kind of dry method be explained?</p>
<p>Let's talk about "issuing paper money" again. The final unified paper money in the "Suwan Border Region" was issued by the "Central China Bank." Its true relationship with the people is about the following two items:</p>
<p>1. Absorbing the agricultural products of the people</p>
<p>2. Absorbing the metal products of the people</p>
<p>Your economic cadres' methods and steps for absorbing the agricultural products of the people are as follows: the first step is to prohibit the export of agricultural products from the people, the second step is to buy at a lower price than outside the "Liberated Zone," and the third step is to transport them to outside the "Liberated Zone" through special merchants to exchange for the materials you need. From this "absorption trilogy," it is clearly pointed out that my statement "everything is for the Communist Party" is not just talking nonsense. The methods and steps of your economic cadres "absorbing the metal products of the people" are as follows: the first step is to stipulate a price that is more than one-third lower than outside the "Liberated Zone" to buy them anytime and anywhere, the second step is that anyone who buys and sells privately, even if it is one silver dollar, cannot escape the fate of being confiscated, and the third step is the same as the third step of absorbing agricultural products. Naturally, the conclusion will not be different.</p>

<h3>"Too Expensive"</h3>
<p>— By L. Tolstoy, translated by Gao Fei</p>
<p>"Too Expensive" was originally a short story by Guy de Maupassant. Tolstoy reused its story to write about the kingdom of Monaco and how it deals with a prisoner in a foolish way. - Translator</p>
<p>Near the border between France and Italy, on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, there is a small kingdom called Monaco. Many small towns would proudly say that they have more residents than this kingdom. Because there are only more than seven thousand people here, and if the land of this small kingdom is divided equally, one resident would not get an acre of poor land. However, in this kingdom, there is a legitimate little emperor, who also has buildings, attendants, courtiers and bishops, as well as generals and troops.</p>
<p>That is not a large team, only sixty people in total, but it is still a team. In this kingdom, there are also taxes, such as tobacco tax, wine tax, liquor tax and poll tax. Although the people here drink and smoke like the people of other countries, if the king cannot find a new and special source of tax revenue, it will be difficult for him to support his courtiers, officials and himself with so few subjects. This special income comes from the roulette tables where people gamble. Gamblers gamble, and no matter what, the officials regularly draw a few percent of tax from the ups and downs, so in all his winnings, he must send a large sum of money to the country. The reason why people bear heavy taxes is that this is the only casino in Europe. Previously, there were several local governments in Germany that used to maintain such casinos, but they were banned a few years ago. The reason for banning gambling is because these casinos can cause so much damage. A person can try his luck, he will exhaust everything and gamble on it, losing all his money. Then he will gamble with money that does not belong to him, and the result is that he loses everything. Finally, in despair, he will drown himself or commit suicide. So the Germans forbid their rulers from earning money in this way. But here no one forbids the King of Monaco, and he exclusively owns this business.</p>
<p>So everyone who wants to gamble goes to Monaco, and whether they win or lose, the king can profit from it. As the saying goes: "A man does not get rich without windfall." The King of Monaco knew that this was a dirty business, but what else could he do? He was already alive, and collecting wine tax and wine tax was not a very pretty thing either. So he still had to live on, rule, plunder silver money, and also go to court and listen to politics with the same etiquette as a real emperor.</p>
<p>He has a coronation ceremony, morning court, rewards, punishments, pardons, and he also has inspections, parliaments, laws and courts, just like other countries, only smaller.</p>
<p>This incident happened not many years ago. A murderer in this kingdom was arrested and imprisoned. The people here were originally peace-loving, and this had never happened before. The judges solemnly gathered together and discussed the case with the most legal attitude. There were judges, prosecutors, jurors and lawyers. They debated, discussed, and finally they ruled that he should be beheaded according to law. That's it. They presented the verdict to the king, who read the verdict and wrote with a pen: "If the prisoner must be executed, execute it without error.</p>
<p>There was one difficulty with this matter, that is, they had neither a guillotine to cut off the prisoner's head, nor an executioner. The ministers considered this matter and decided to send a letter to the government of a certain country, asking the French government to lend them a machine and an expert to kill the prisoner, and if possible, please have the French government honestly reply to how much money they would need. The letter was sent out, and a reply came a week later, saying that the machine and the expert could be supplied, and all it would cost was 16,000 francs. The reply was placed before the king, and he considered: 16,000 francs! "That poor bug doesn't deserve that much money," he said: "Is there any way to make it cheaper? Uh! Sixteen thousand francs is more than the total amount of two francs per person in the country? The people may not want to bear it, and it may cause a riot.</p>
<p>Therefore, a meeting was convened to discuss what to do about this matter, and it was decided to send a letter to the King of Italy as well. France is a republic and has no respect for kings at all, but the King of Italy is a brotherly monarch, and he may be persuaded to be cheaper. So the letter was written immediately, and a reply was received quickly.</p>
<p>The Italian government wrote that they would be happy to supply the machine and the expert, and the total price would be only 12,000 francs, including shipping. This is naturally cheaper. But it is still too expensive. That bad guy really doesn't deserve this money. That still requires everyone to bear a heavy tax of nearly two francs. The parliament was convened again, and they discussed and thought about how to settle this matter with less expense. Isn't there a soldier who can finish him off with a rough and simple method? The generals were summoned, and they were asked: "Can't you find us a soldier who can kill people? In war, they are merciless in killing people. In fact, that is the purpose of training them." The generals repeatedly questioned the soldiers to see who could carry out this matter, but no soldier could complete the mission. "No," they said, "we don't know how to carry it out, this is not what we have been taught!"</p>
<p>What to do? The ministers thought and thought again. They convened a committee, a special committee and a small committee, and finally they decided that the best way was to change the death penalty to life imprisonment, which would not only allow the king to express his magnanimity, but also be cheaper.</p>
<p>The king also agreed, and that's how the matter was handled. There was only one difficulty, that is, there was no prison here for life imprisonment. There was a small detention center, which was only used to temporarily detain people, but there was no strong prison suitable for long-term use. Anyway, they finally found a place to deal with it. They locked the young prisoner inside and set up a guard to watch him. The guard had to monitor the prisoner and take food for him from the palace kitchen.</p>
<p>The prisoner was locked in prison, month after month, and a whole year passed. But when the old year passed, one day the little king checked his income and expenses and noticed an expense, that is, the cost of imprisoning the prisoner. That was not a small bill, especially with a guard and the prisoner's diet, it cost more than 600 francs a year. The worst thing was that the prisoner was still young and healthy, and he could live to be fifty years old. If you add it all up, the number is amazing. It can never be done like this, so the king summoned the ministers and said:</p>
<p>"Regarding this rogue, you must find a cheaper method. The current disposal is too wasteful." The ministers gathered together and considered again and again, and then one said: "Gentlemen, in my opinion, we must remove the guard." "But," another said, "the prisoner will run away." "That's right," the first speaker said again: "Let him run away, to hell with him!" So they presented the resolution to the king, and he agreed. Once the guard was removed, they waited for the scene that was about to happen. However, what happened was that in the middle of the day, the prisoner came out. He did not look for the guard, but went straight to the palace kitchen to collect his own lunch. He only took a portion freely, turned back to the prison, closed the prison door, and stayed in the house. The next day was the same: at the appropriate time, he took his own food. As for running away? He did not show any signs. What to do? They were thinking about this matter again.</p>
<p>"Let's tell him directly!" they said: "We don't want to imprison him anymore."</p>
<p>So the Minister of Justice summoned the prisoner.</p>
<p>"Why don't you run away?" the minister asked: "There is no guard watching you! Now you can go anywhere you want, and the king will not pursue it."</p>
<p>"I also say that the king will not pursue it," the prisoner said: "But I have nowhere to go, what else can I do? You have already ruined my personality by convicting me, people will abandon me, and I have lost my job. You have wronged me, that's not pretty. First of all, since you have sentenced me to death, you should execute it, but you didn't, that's one thing, I didn't complain. Later, you sentenced me to life imprisonment and asked the guard to get food for me, but after a while, you dismissed him, and I had to take my own food, and I didn't complain either. Now you want me to leave, and I can't agree to it. Do whatever you want, but I will never leave." What to do? The meeting was convened again, what method could they use? The prisoner would never leave. They thought and thought again, the only way to get him to leave was to give him alimony, so they reported it to the king. "There is no other way to do this," they said: "Anyway, we must tell him to leave." The amount was decided to be 600 francs and notified to the prisoner. "Okay," he said: "I don't care, as long as you pay on time. On this condition, I am willing to go out."</p>
<p>This matter was handled in this way. The prisoner took one-third of the alimony and left this kingdom. It only took fifteen minutes by train to leave the country. He settled on the border of a neighboring country, where he bought some land, opened a vegetable garden, and is now living comfortably. He often goes to collect his alimony on time. After receiving the cash, he goes to the gambling stall and throws in three or two francs to gamble. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses, and then he goes back. He lives in peace and comfort.</p>
<p>It is really fortunate: he did not commit such a crime in a country that is willing to buy a killing machine, nor in a country that can imprison for life.</p>

<h3>Snow Mud Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Huajian</p>
<p>Snow Mud, Sun Hong, is an old friend of mine in Shanghai in painting circles. He is famous at the time as the manager of a certain art company, but although he is in the mundane world, he indulges himself outside the mountains and forests; he dabbles in clouds and mist, and his brushstrokes are interesting. However, because he is busy with work, he has no time to create more. Recently, he suddenly became excited and spent two months writing two hundred works, half landscapes and half plum blossoms and bamboos, which are publicly exhibited in the Chinese Painting Academy. The landscapes he creates have the bones of Shi Xi and the elegance of Xin Luo. Although they are hasty and unintentional, they can prepare the six methods outside the image. They are sparse and distant, as if they do not eat human fireworks; comparing them with those that are scarlet and red, how different are the elegant and vulgar. The plum blossoms have more branches than flowers, with iron bones and ice hearts, standing tall in the wind and snow. The spirit of not yielding, tenacity and love of fragrance is active on the paper. Yun Xi likes to create withered trees and old trees, with gnarled branches, which are extremely tortuous, simple and elegant. More than ten pots of ancient pine bonsai collected by Zheng Meiqing are also displayed in the field, which are larger than usual and thicker than an arch. The roots are like peaks standing side by side, the trunks are like dragons and snakes flying, the leaves are like gathered covers high, and the branches are like crab claws running horizontally; some are hanging upside down, like a dragon exploring the sea; some are lying up, like a phoenix flying in the sky. The surrounding area is matched with landscape paintings, as if you are in a lotus capital and forget that you are in a room. Zheng Junyun has hundreds of pots in his home. Yu Su likes to write about pine trees. Hearing this, he is happy and strange. When he has time one day, he will visit the mansion to write a portrait for the old dragon scales.</p>
<h3>Country Evening</h3>
<p>— Dale Nichols</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 87</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>We were outside the wall, took out our pistols, just in case; waited less than ten minutes, and sure enough, we heard a kind of whining sound, as if someone was wearing soft-soled shoes and walking on the sand, but after listening carefully, the sound was gone. We were just concentrating our spirits and pricking up our ears, when we suddenly heard a dull thunder-like "buzzing" sound, a dog barking, as if it was barking over our heads. We knew at once that this was a Mongolian Mastiff. When this beast's bark came, it also scratched on the stone wall with its claws. With the stature of a Mongolian Mastiff, two hind legs stood up, and two front paws could reach the top of the wall. It was scratching on the stone wall, it must be someone who held it back and could not stretch its body as much as possible. What's strange is that until now we don't hear human footsteps or other movements.</p>
<p>At this critical moment. Tiger Brother and I just stuck our bodies tightly to the wall, controlling our breathing, not daring to move, and concentrated our hearing and vision on the top of the wall. At this time, as long as a human head or a dog head appeared over the wall, we would have to act.</p>
<p>Who knew that we waited quietly for a while, and there was no movement. I was a little impatient and wanted to signal Tiger Brother to move north, but Tiger Brother had already made a gesture and told me to be vigilant. He ran past my side, attacked towards the north along the root of the wall, lightly and quickly. Less than two feet away, I saw that he seemed to still be holding the gun in his waist. He put his hands on the top of the wall and hung his body up. His head gradually appeared over the wall. He looked at my head first, then looked at the north, and let go and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>"Gone!" Tiger Brother ran over and pointed to the south, "It's a Japanese devil, leading a Mastiff."</p>
<p>After waiting quietly for a while, the damn guy had gone far away. Tiger Brother went up the wall and gave a safe signal. We flipped back into the wall again and walked north along the jungle. Tiger Brother led the way, about ten steps away from me. After walking less than ten yards, I suddenly felt startled and heard a rustling sound coming from behind me. Instinctively, I said "Huh!" I turned my head and saw a Mastiff as big as a calf rushing towards me. Behind the giant dog was also a person, like a ghost, running extremely fast, but I didn't hear any footsteps.</p>
<p>"Stop!" I said softly. When danger came, I felt calm in my mind. At this time, even if I drilled into the jungle, it would be useless, because dogs can drill faster. If I wanted to cross the wall, it was still more than ten feet away, and the dog could also track me. Besides, the devil might have a gun with him. At this time, my left hand had already raised the pistol, covering the enemy, and my right hand was holding the small sword. Fearing that other Japanese troops would be alarmed, I temporarily endured it and didn't fire the gun. I just whispered and planned to calm the enemy down first.</p>
<p>I had just said "Stop!" when a strong light shot at my face unexpectedly, forcing my eyes. It was too late to fire the gun at this time.</p>
<p>"Hey, good kid!" the guy said with a good Northeast accent; ten feet away from me, he restrained the dog and stopped together.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, I jumped violently to the road, broke out of the guy's flashlight beam, and then turned around and crouched down and drilled into the jungle. Just as I was caught by two thick winter green poles in the jungle, I heard this sound. I turned my head to look, my eyes were still flashing from the strong light just now, but I could barely see a slender shadow less than ten feet away on the road, flashing east and jumping west, fighting with the giant Mastiff. The giant Mastiff roared menacingly, and pounced east and west like a fierce tiger at the thin figure. I fixed my eyes and looked carefully, and I could see that it was indeed Tiger Brother fighting with the giant Mastiff. The devil who was leading the dog fell to the ground, like a pile of something.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, I immediately withdrew from the jungle, still holding a small sword in one hand and a gun in the other, and pressed forward. When Tiger Brother saw it, he fought the dog and whispered, "Little Aunt, don't come up, let me beat this dog!" I could only stop and move slightly closer, still wanting to take the opportunity to join the battle. I saw Tiger Brother and the dog flashing left and right twice, and the dog suddenly jumped up, pounced forward, and looked like it was about to fall on Tiger Brother. I saw Tiger Brother taking a step back, propping his left arm, and his left hand slapped, with a loud sound, right on the dog's ear. Such a big Mastiff, after this slap, staggered and howled and lay down.</p>
<h3>Friendship in Cultural Circles</h3>
<p>— Hualin</p>
<p>Last time at the World Society, when we saw Li Shuhua off to attend the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization meeting, he said that more than fifty countries would be represented, mostly by well-known figures in academic and educational circles. Therefore, the attitude of the discussions was very sincere, unlike political meetings, which are full of treachery and cunning. I also feel that people in cultural and academic circles are genuine and loyal, with compassion and a sense of justice. Even when discussing politics, their aim is to save mankind, not to compete for power and profit, with no thought of personal gain or ambition to harm others. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization may one day be able to unite the world!</p>
<p>We initiated the Xiangxue Garden Literary Salon and revived the Literary Teahouse in Shanghai, both purely for social purposes. There is no chairman, no one manipulating things, it is all free and unconstrained. It is precisely because there are no political struggles that we can talk about friendship and unity, and discuss the prosperity of the country and cultural construction together, further extending to universal love for mankind, and seeking world peace and tranquility. These responsibilities can only be shouldered by people in cultural and academic circles!</p>
<p>True friendship may perhaps see a glimmer of light in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization! Now in Shanghai, we want to breathe a little free air, so there is the "Literary Salon" at Xiangxue Garden and the "Literary Teahouse" at the fifth-floor restaurant of the Great New Company. Everyone can feel at ease to say the truth they want to say, without the need for that set of hypocritical and cunning political tactics! Starting with friendship and with cultural academics as the highest goal, world peace can be realized! Human reform can have a hopeful future!</p>
<p>Friends in literary and art circles! Those of you without political ambitions can join hands and come, let's walk together towards the path of light!</p>

<h3>Ramblings Under a Dim Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai's Death</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai has been sentenced to death. After the presiding judge announced the verdict, he said: "If you are not satisfied, you can appeal to the Supreme Court, the highest authority, they can reduce your sentence." Before being taken back to prison, our reporter asked him how he felt. He said: "This is the judge trying to ease my mind. My death was decided on the day Director Dai Yunong died in the line of duty. If Director Dai were here, he could have taken the blame for me."</p>
<p>The dead cannot testify, so we have to take his word for it. However, if there really is an underworld, it looks like Zhou would be ready to settle accounts with Director Dai.</p>
<p>According to the deputy manager of the Real Estate Department of the Trust Bureau: As of now, not a single person has applied to register their lane houses. No one is a fool, who would want to do something so foolish, spending money to get annoyed.</p>
<p>Real estate transactions in Shanghai have recently been almost dead. Banks cannot take mortgages, why would anyone tie up their capital in a pile of bricks and mud? Moreover, the use value far exceeds the property value. With tens of millions, putting it out for usury is more profitable and flexible, why not do that?</p>
<p>Another factor is that for real estate transactions, the municipal government charges 50% for property transfer taxes, plus other miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, if you spend 20 million yuan to buy a house, you would probably have to pay more than 30 million, so it is not cheap.</p>
<p>We are really worried about the Trust Bureau!</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on Current Affairs</p>
<h3>Laws are as Numerous as Hairs, But Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>— Hu Yisheng</p>
<p>In the view of those who study economics, any policy must have an economic foundation to be a good policy. It is easy to implement and easy to achieve results. Conversely, even with clever ideas, it will only "backfire" and is bound to fail.</p>
<p>After the victory, the government's policies, on the surface, lack unity, with everyone doing their own thing, exhausting the people. No wonder there is a sigh that laws are as numerous as hairs. In essence, they lack an economic foundation. Examples are readily available. The most recent are:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Social Affairs, based on humanitarian considerations, abolished prostitution and rickshaws. The intention is good, but try to imagine what the brothels will live on after prostitution is abolished? Will the government introduce jobs or find suitable spouses? What will the rickshaw pullers and their families live on after rickshaws are abolished? If they are not transferred to legitimate occupations, are the consequences not considered? If these problems are not solved in advance, merely advocating humanitarian slogans and trying to emulate Washington's emancipation of blacks, it is appropriate for rickshaw puller groups to oppose it, only increasing social unrest. We should recognize: "The pain of unemployment is greater than everything, and unemployment is the root of all evils." Therefore, first solve the general unemployment in China, so that all citizens have livelihoods and no one is unemployed, and then take a further step to abolish prostitution and rickshaws. This is a good policy with an economic foundation, which will surely be supported by the public. (2) Recently, national conscription has been implemented. It is of course a matter of course, but there is much room for research on its methods. The position and responsibility of Chinese youth are fundamentally different from those of advanced countries in the world. In advanced countries, the cost of education is entirely borne by the state. Even after graduating from university and serving society, their salaries are not immediately relied upon to support their parents, but gradually seek to become self-reliant. Chinese youth are different: some youth completely rely on their families, do not engage in livelihood, and are merely parasites of society. Others are families that completely rely on youth. They are not given sufficient opportunities to go to school in childhood. Once they are over ten years old, they are ordered to learn a trade. The income from their apprenticeship is saved to support the family. They begin to have family burdens. In addition, the age of marriage is too early. Before the age of thirty, children are in groups and the burden is extremely heavy, old, and dying. This kind of youth actually accounts for the majority of Chinese youth, and being conscripted suddenly will inevitably cause serious problems. The authorities did not study this and suddenly carried out general conscription, so conscription became voluntary soldiers, and then turned into buying and selling soldiers. If this trend continues, it will be an obstacle to the implementation of true military service in the future. The benefits have not been seen, but the disadvantages are numerous. From the perspective of the country, at present, in the era of economic construction, all government affairs must take the expansion of productivity as the first priority, or at least maintain the existing productivity, and must never weaken it. The problem of professional youth indirectly and directly benefits the productive elements, so being conscripted is tantamount to destroying production. We often think about why the government does not first shift the conscription target to vagrants and unemployed youth? This is beneficial from any point of view.</p>
<p>But here, it should be stated that I am not opposed to the Ministry of Social Affairs' abolition of prostitution and rickshaws, and even less to singing different tunes on the conscription national policy, but for the lack of economic foundation of the policy, I would like to propose a long-term discussion to improve it.</p>
<h3>The Most Perfect Public Bus</h3>
<p>— Translated by Da from Machinery Magazine</p>
<p>Lauren Couth, a third-year student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Cambridge University, is planning the most ideal public bus, which can only accommodate forty passengers.</p>
<p>What passengers hate the most is the noisy engine. The ideal public bus is equipped with soundproofing panels.</p>
<p>If the outside temperature is too hot, breaking the 100-degree mark, then the temperature inside the public bus will always be around 70 degrees, so you won't sweat like a pig. Perhaps the fog outside is too thick and the air is too humid, the humidity inside is just right.</p>
<p>If you are thirsty, there is sand-filtered water inside, or even whiskey, and the cups are ready-made. Just tap your hand on the faucet, and it is enough for you to enjoy!</p>
<p>The glass windows of the carriage are always crystal clear and have frost-proof brushes and rain wipers, which are electric. So you can sit in the seat and watch the snow scene outside.</p>
<p>The tires are the latest type, and the inner tube is not filled with gas, which can avoid the danger of a blowout.</p>
<p>There are four electric motors, each with seventy-five horsepower.</p>
<p>Of course, it does not use gasoline, which can avoid fire, but in case of emergency, the carriage is equipped with fire-fighting equipment, and there is also wireless telephone equipment installed, so that passengers are not bored.</p>
<p>If you happen to have an urgent need, there is a toilet in the carriage. This kind of public bus is very suitable for long-distance travel. The British Ministry of Transport rejected its manufacture because this kind of public bus is too aristocratic. The US Highway Administration has contacted him and is preparing to manufacture it in large quantities for practical use.</p>
<p>It is said that the first batch of one hundred vehicles will be traveling on the spacious highways of the United States.</p>
<p>Shanghai Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Doctor Examination</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Chinese Medicine Practitioner Examination was held from the 1st to the 3rd of this month at Guanghua University and Zhongzheng Middle School. Nearly two thousand people participated in the examination. The situation at the examination hall was quite different from other examinations. The writer will record what he saw and present it to the readers.</p>
<p>Among the two thousand people, the most are graduates of Chinese medicine colleges under the age of thirty, and several professors also came to take the exam. There are also many old doctors over sixty years old. Most wear casual clothes, a few wear melon-skin hats and blue robes with black jackets, and less than 1% wear suits.</p>
<p>On the first day, it was stipulated that they must arrive at 6:45. Therefore, before dawn, many rickshaws were seen running north on Sichuan Road, that is, three-wheeled vehicles and cars. Many people who came from other places were not allowed to take the exam because they arrived too late.</p>
<p>Because the seats in the examination hall were insufficient, Chinese medicine practitioners and judicial personnel were mixed together in the first examination hall in the auditorium. The second and third examination halls were in the dining hall, and eight people sat at a square table together. Everyone felt that the seats were unsuitable and suffered a lot. Therefore, the order was greatly affected. There were several cases of candidates being detained by bailiffs for passing around examination papers.</p>
<p>The topics of the subjects tested, such as diagnostics, prescription studies, and pharmacology, were not very difficult. Anyone with a considerable foundation in medicine could cope with them. The topic of Chinese language was "On National Health," which was also easy to develop. However, the topics for the elective subjects were more difficult to answer. It is said that the internal medicine topics were the most profound, called "Harm if excessive, controlled if inherited." Most people do not understand its exact meaning, and the answers given are also different. Some people even read the word "Nai" as "Xi" or "Qi," which is laughable.</p>
<p>Everyone felt unfamiliar with the subject of the Constitution. Therefore, before the temporary exam, they all held the "Law in the Period of Political Tutelage" issued by the medical school and read it.</p>
<p>In the gynecology topics, the diagnosis and treatment of "metrorrhagia" were not well understood. After the examination, both men and women discussed this issue without any scruples.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the last day, the oral examination was divided into twenty examination halls. The chief examiners were the members of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Examination Committee. What was tested was also questions related to diagnostics, prescriptions, and drugs. Therefore, 20% of the people gave up their rights. Some candidates and chief examiners were professors at the same medical school, and they pretended not to know each other in the examination hall.</p>
<p>It is said that all the examination papers were sent to Nanjing for grading, and the number of people admitted was very small, so everyone felt uneasy.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The new student dormitory of Jiaotong University is about to be completed, and Zhesheng Hall has also been completely renovated. The renovation work of each dormitory room and classroom will also be completed soon, symbolizing a new and thriving atmosphere.</p>
<p>There is a student from Sichuan at Jiaotong University. He is usually in poor health, but he is diligent and persevering in his studies. He has won generous scholarships several times. Recently, due to overwork, he suddenly coughed up blood incessantly. His classmates rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment. His condition is still very serious. His classmates are very sad, and they all call the scholarship he received "blood scholarship," because it is the "price of blood."</p>
<p>A large number of parasites are stationed on the campus of Jiaotong University, ostensibly for the purpose of service, but actually making profits with a black heart. For example, ×× service office, ×× dining hall, etc., are all run by merchants. Not only are water, electricity, and housing supplied by the school, but they can also evade business tax, but the prices of the goods they sell are not cheaper than the general market, and sometimes even higher. Students often complain and have launched a "boycott movement."</p>
<p>The trend of posting notes for buying and selling in Chongqing schools has been brought to Shanghai. Recently, the walls of the corridor of the Central and Upper Courtyards of Jiaotong University are full of notes for "cheap sales" and "solicitation." The most exciting ones are even "weeping big cheap sales" and "desperate big auctions." Looking at the items traded, they are mostly winter clothes, required textbooks, and food group meal tickets.</p>
<p>The coursework at Jiaotong University has always been extremely strict. In the past, at least one-fifth of the students were eliminated every year. At a recent faculty meeting, Dean of Academic Affairs Li Ximou said that the grading method of our school in Chongqing in the past was too strict, and it can be slightly relaxed in the future. Those whose failing credits exceed one-third will also be allowed to participate in the makeup examination. Generally, the students who are worried about "one-third" are overjoyed when they hear this, as if they have been granted a general amnesty.</p>
<h3>Filler</h3>
<p>— Holy</p>
<p>Zhang Qun went to the United States for medical treatment this time because he suffered from "stomach pain." A newspaper in a certain county in Jiangxi mistakenly published it as "hemorrhoids." Although it is the same disease, it is very different. This is a big joke!</p>
<h3>Intelligence Test Answer</h3>
<p>(According to the test questions published in yesterday's issue)</p>
<p>No book has a location between pages fifty-three and fifty-four, but by chance, Cade was reading a story on page fifty-three. And found that the reverse side is page fifty-four, and there is no place to put banknotes in between. This is also something that is easily overlooked in daily life, but the servant revealed his feet!</p>
<h3>Weekend Chat</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>The weekend itself is originally very tempting. The term "Saturday" often symbolizes liberation, frankness, and comfort. However, the bleak reality in recent months has made people feel like chewing olives on weekends. The past luxury that existed in people's minds has now gradually faded. Last weekend, I counted the number of suicide and murder events that occurred in Pinghan, Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places in a week. As a result, I found that more than half of the total of 26 events were forced by life, and almost all of these people who were squeezed to the end by life were business people and public officials. Let's set aside the economic life of public officials for the time being. Just in terms of business, take a few of the most realistic examples of the Shanghai market in the past week: several large stores such as Wanguo and Heming are on the verge of closing down; tobacco companies are closing down one after another; Goshi Man and the Goldfish Restaurant have been converted into American goods markets; and only four tickets were sold for the premiere of "Phantom of the Opera" at the Lyceum Theatre. Don't look at their "price reductions" and "competitive sales" as a prosperous atmosphere. Seeing that high interest rates are about to force them to become the continuation of the former. As Su Manshu said: "Chickens in cages are close to the soup knife when they have food." Writing this on the weekend, I can't help but feel inexplicably melancholy for the day when those descendants of Tao Zhu will also have to chew olives!</p>
<p>Blood Suckers</p>
<p>According to reports, a bandit was executed in Wuxi last month. Afterwards, some people took several white steamed buns at the execution ground and dipped them in fresh brain blood and devoured them with relish. This man's appetite is amazing, and the degree of innocence is really admirable. It is originally rumored in mountain countries that "seeing blood wards off evil spirits, and eating blood prolongs life." I think this man must be suffering from poverty and illness, and he cannot eat the milk powder and vitamins that are rationed. In addition to lamenting that he was not born at the right time, he was fortunate to encounter this "good opportunity that is a pity to discard," so he gorged on fresh human blood; on the one hand, he implemented direct supplementation, and on the other hand, he wanted to get a bit of bloody air, so that he could squeeze into the so-called upper class who are full of brains and fat in society, let them verify that "it is my kind," and from then on he can openly suck the blood on others. This man's situation is of course worthy of pity, and his intentions are also bitter, but I heard that public opinion in Xidi once launched a major crusade against this matter, and advocated sanctions based on "humanity." The reason is of course very right, but I think that at present, everyone has the desire to eat blood, but it is only a matter of light and darkness. Why be surprised?</p>
<p>Why Bother</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw many of the latest styles of this year's fashion coats published in Shanghai newspapers, which seemed like a clothing guide. However, the other side of the newspaper published a large number of photos of indigenous people taken from Luoping, Yunnan, who were completely naked, not even wearing pants. This is really not a small satire to us self-proclaimed civilized people. The same Chinese land, the eastern and western ends, are like two worlds. Someone said that the little bit of so-called civilization represented by Shanghai is completely manifested in the dazzling clothing. At first, it sounded like an insult, but after thinking about it, it is the truth. Try to open everyone's gorgeous clothes, and aren't their bodies covered with scars of cunning, shamelessness, and greed? Close your eyes and imagine those naked, dark, and healthy bodies in Luoping, containing a piece of heart that is so simple and flawless. It is indeed too fascinating! In fact, the current price of fashion in Shanghai is not something that everyone can afford, but because of face, they have to try their best to try a few sets of new ones, which is considered not to bow their heads in front of others. After careful consideration, why bother?</p>
