<h3>靑年黨首次發言　擁護國家至上贊同強有力政府</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國大第八次大會午前會議中，各代表發表意見如後：</p>
<p>新區代表阿布拉哈特馬合素木世界任何革命均有第一目標及口號，孫中山先生曾提國內各民族一律平等之崇高原則，便自民國成立至今三十五年來，未見事實。邊疆地方，新疆爲歐亞橋樑，形勢特要，新省各族同胞均爲中華民族之組成者，何地位不平等如是？希國大與政府對此一問題共同負責，在憲法中求取澈底解決。</p>
<p>康土代表曲木倡民：各省區土著民族同胞，多已漢化，然生活受控於漢胞之大紳誼吏，毫無政治地位，請大會注意，應將少數民族之地位提高，福利增進一點訂入憲法。</p>
<p>遴選代表史尙寬：（一）五權憲法之特點在擷取議會制及總統制之長而去其短，以國民大會代表人民行有力之政權，以五院治權與政府使其有能修正寧則以治權機關行最強大之政權，應予政正。（二）第五十八條行政院對立法院「負責」之字樣不對，院間關係乃平等聯緊，行政立法兩院間之爭執應由國大評判。</p>
<p>遴選代表何魯之：（靑年黨）大會多數意見認爲治權機關互相制衡，行政力量將相抵相消，甚有道理。吾人雖參與憲草修正案審議工作，但其內容規定並盡係靑年黨之主張，吾人夙認國家利益高於一切，爲國家民族之前途計，決不固步自封，堅持成見。吾人亦贊同設立強有力之政府，以應付當前之局面，希大會及分組後之各審委會作詳盡之討論，制定一部最完美，最合理，最適國情之憲法，吾人亦必追隨諸位代表之後，努力於今後之建國大業。</p>
<p>遴選代表余家菊：吾人（靑年黨）係少數黨，發生作用須在正反面意見當時。今僅表示意見如下：（一）民意機關應常設，常開會，人數不宜過多，應與行政機關平行。修正案中立法院之職權合此條件，其對行政院僅就事否決法津政策，而不對人作不信任投票，亦合國情。（二）總統之權利不宜過大達過小，使其有能而不得專權。（三）自治制度應以適當方法用之維護統一不能以「自治」行「分裂」，由能以「自治」行「分裂」，亦不能以「統一」行「壓制」。（四）職業及婦女團體在民意機關中應有發言人。</p>
<p>遴選代表王師曾：人民以政權控制政府不外三點：人選控制，政事控制，立法控制，修正案及五五憲草對此有相同之出發點，唯五五以之盡予國大，修正案則以之分交國大及立法院，吾人承認孫中山先生政治理想慣用語最卓越者，但其實現之條件，須俟全國各地均達憲政時期方可，目前情形實尙未達其時，主張國大權力一項維持第三章第二十七條之規定自由職業代表胡定安：（一）欲強國必先強種，國民體格水準必須提高，主張將人民之保建權，休息權及衛生行列入憲法。（二）自由職業在職團代表中之名額應予顧及。</p>
<p>鄂區代表詹學海：（一）權能劃分，（二）政權應脫離治權獨立，（三）國大可常設一人數較少之機構於休會時代行政權，以免立法院權限過大，治權刦掠政權。</p>
<p>遴選女代表唐國楨：（一）首都之地點不明訂於憲法中，（二）邊區少數民族及職業與婦女團體之選舉，應在第一二九條之後列明，以消除事實上之不平等。</p>
<p>鄂區代表孔庚：靑年黨各代表業已表明意見，請主席團邀民社黨諸搖動有先生發言。</p>
<p>滇區代表周鍾嶽：（一）修正案集五五定稿以來之各項意見，大體尙好，（二）立法院權力過大一點應予修正。</p>
<p>晉區代表王懷明：第九十條考試不應謹限於公務員，應包括公職候選人，「分區定額」一語，界限不明確，辦法不澈底，應更打爲「分區考試，按省定額。」</p>
<p>晉區代表李鴻文：（一）第四條領土之變更必經國大通過，（二第四）章國大職權應修增，（三）建都應就國家安全，民族利益考慮，不應有區域之私。主張定都北平，因：（一）地理歷史上爲古來名都建都於北平者，恒可延續統治，（二）國防上，可控東北及西北，（三）經濟上重工業原料俱在北方，欲建國必須儘力開發，都北平就近易舉，（四）交通上水陸皆極便利，（五）氣候上，北平夏季不誤工作。</p>
<p>津職代表苑寶璜：國在工人代表數目應在職團選舉中規定。</p>
<p>冀區代表吳延環：（一）憲草序言內「孫中山先生」應尊冠以「國父」稱謂，（二）建都北平之主張實出自國防安全之觀點，決非自私，希望各方勿輕出閑言　語。</p>
<p>臺區代表李萬居：（一）第十四條應改爲「人民有信仰主義及宗敎之自由以免合混，（二）國大權太小，（三）地方權利應再予明確規定，（四）臺灣人民百分之九十五以上均已受敎育，程度頗高，可否予行憲時自治。</p>
<h3>張瀾週內來滬</h3>
<p>民盟即將召開中常會</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟常委沈鈞儒，三日下午四時由京抵滬，據談：張瀾定十日前由渝來滬。又答記者問稱：關於民社黨與民盟之關係及民盟秘書長之繼任人選及其他民盟內部問題，均將在民盟中常會中討論。渠并說明盟秘書長現由副秘書長周新民代理。又民盟常委十七人中，除梁漱溟已派代表，屆時不能來滬出席中常會外，黃炎培·間伯均·張申府，理均在滬。</p>
<h3>張東蓀將來滬　與張君會晤</h3>

<p>〔本報北平四日電〕民社黨反對參加國大之張東蓀，胡海門，梁秋水三氏，頃接張君　來電，促飛上海會商黨團結問題，聞三氏已準備前往。</p>
<h3>國防會例會　改明日舉行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕原應於四日舉行之國防最高委會例會，並未召開，聞已改定六日下午舉行。</p>
<h3>國大代表節省點心費　捐欵賬濟京難民　主席團議決各代表另致特別費</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕國大若干倀表軫念本京難民，迭有動議節省大會點心費，移作賬濟之用，並請各代表捐款賬濟。頃悉：此案業經主席團會議議決，依照各代表之意，自四日起大會停止供應點心，其費用移付賬濟，並函請國府令飭主管機關妥速分配救濟難民，至捐款賬濟，則由各代表自由認捐，交大會堂內郵匯局辦事處代表彙轉，聞該辦事處於四日一日內已收到捐款一百萬元，捐款搖動有爲王同業·李應生·呼延立人·陳行蓀·胡宜明·薛篤弼·薛士選·朱叔癡·廖公圃·陳景川·劉侯武·丁仲英·萬竹村·周兆麟·王明選等，尙有二代表以無名氏認捐卅一萬元。此外，該辦事處職員陶婉小姐，亦自動輸損一萬元。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國大主席團以京市物價高昂，各代表所領膳宿費不敷應用，特於主席團第十次會議時提出討論，經議決每代表由大會致送特別五十萬元，并函請國府飭財部緊急支付，日內即可分送各代表。</p>
<h3>民社黨代表先後發言　釋政協憲草精神　盼能制定全民百年大法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國大第八次會下午各代表談話要點如次：</p>
<p>徐傳霖：憲草大體甚佳，惟吾人目前應制定一全國人民需要之百年大計，大家應平心靜氣討論。本人並希望此憲草能大會上通過，惟第七條「定都南京」應行刪去，因各國均無將定都放在憲法內者。同時如國家遭到意外，即必須遷都，議會亦將因而無法召集，故不能確定地點。對於首都地點，本人認爲目前應在北平，將來則北平亦不是好地方。我國與外國交往不在東南而在西北，故建都應在西蘭州，其理由爲：（一）可能鞏固西北國防，（二）西北地曠人稀，東南人煙稠密，如建都西北，則東南一帶人民，可以移民西北，達到開發目的，（三）西北文化落後，如建都西北，可以消除東南文化畸形發展之現象，而使全國文化普遍平均的發展。關於此點下次大會當再續談。</p>
<p>最後，本人對第十三章第一三七條「中華民國之外交，應本獨立自主精神，以敦睦邦交，履行條約義務，遵守聯合國憲章，促進國際合作，確保世界和平爲基本政策」，其中「遵守聨合國憲草」七字應刪去，因聯合國憲章是暫時的，我國憲章則是永遠的</p>
<h3>減輕黨派色彩　顧及環境需要</h3>
<p>蔣勻田：此次蔣主席所提交大會之憲法草案，大部份是全國各黨派及社會賢達代表協商之結果，本黨旣曾參加協商，在道義方面不能不尊重協商的意見，但這部憲草是各方面意見相匯合成，以從理論方面着眼，有若干條文與本黨的理想亦有相當距離。</p>
<p>我們民社黨以爲旣是爲國家制定百年大法，爲全國人民建立共守的常規，第一須減輕黨派的色彩，第二須顧及目前實際環境需要，減輕黨派的色彩，始能滲透各方面意見，其滲透的意見愈多，必更能獲得多數人的擁護，能顧及實際環境的需要，運用始能靈活，施行的時候必可減少許多困難。這部憲草就是在這兩大前提下寫成的。</p>
<p>就減輕黨派色彩說：第一條就是一例，是已經滲透各方意見將全國國民都已包括在內，就顧及環境的需要說，第三·第四·五·六各章，合起來看即知其特點所在，一如國民大會能舉出賢明卓絕的大總統，在憲草規定中可以許他發揮卓越之才能，以領導建國大業，不致逼迫他有超越憲法的行爲。如國民大會選不出第一流的大總統，而立法院能同意一位精明能幹的行政院長，則行政院長在本憲草中亦可發揮其才能，而代替大部統領導建國大業。日來聽見各代表意見，認爲國民大會權限太小，從量的方面君祇有選舉或罷免大總統及修改憲法，似乎太少，惟從行使權力的重要性看，其權限實偉大神聖。如每位國大代表都能替國家舉出大總統，則其對國家貢獻甚大。至於修改憲法，都是最基本重要的權力。所以我們認爲國民大會的權力，並不小於立法院。幾天來聽到各位職業代表，婦女代表的意見，尤其是邊疆代表，本黨顯示予以同情的考慮。</p>
<h3>立院權力較大　表現民主精神</h3>
<p>伍藻池：此憲草極能充分表現民主政治之精神，同時且能與近代憲法思潮相配合，自十九世紀以來，歐美各國憲法無論內質或外形，均帶有個人主義與社會主議之色彩，個有主義所爭者爲政治平等，社會主義之主要目的爲經濟平等，此一憲草將此兩咱思潮收進去。第十二章是政治平等主義之具體表現，第十三章一三八條至第一四二條，則表現了社會主義之精神，此兩種精神在全部憲草中，亦隨處可見到。物別是立法表現得相當顯明，立法院之權力較大，惟其如此，民主政治之精神，才更加充實，惟我們這樣說，並非認爲一憲草是盡善盡美，因爲我們知道，此憲草係應客觀環境要求之結果，又必要加上三民主義全部　本原則而寫成，如需修改則更爲完美，即必須詳細研究。</p>
<p>孫亞夫：此一寫草不違背總理遺敎，且有共黨·靑年黨·民社黨的意見匯合而成，乃各黨派犧牲成見所擬定者，有人認爲國大權限太小，政權即人民的權，而人民的權由代表行使即爲間接民權。國大有選舉及罷免總統。副總統與憲法修正案的通過權，以及選舉立委·鹽委的間接民權等。至於立法院權限太大，可以公民投票行使直接民權以減少之。</p>
<p>張鳳九：吾等邊疆同胞，均能信仰三民主義，擁護國民政府，希望能得到同等的權利，並增加民族自治一章。</p>
<p>劉東岩：本人認爲此一憲草內有三特點；（一）可以防止集權政治的產生，政府雖不是萬能政府，但還是有能的政府敵合潮流，（二）提高民權實現民主政治，（三）調和各方面意見，可達到和平統一的目的。</p>
<p>夏濤聲：憲法只要能遷就是好的，此一憲草乃綜各各方面意見，能行自然是一部好憲法。</p>
<p>夏爾康：國大一章應採取比例代表制產生，代表並增加女代表相當的比例。</p>
<p>李培天：行政院下設最高經濟委委會應予取消。因其爲一與民爭利構，另行設立僑務邊政兩部。</p>
<h3>婦女職業代表　均應參加制憲</h3>
<p>顧毓琇：第一五一條稱，憲法之實行與修正，有另定實施程序之必要者，以法津定之，一四六條則稱，經立法院通過總統公佈之法律，前後有所抵觸，吾人接受主席意旨，早日實施憲政，並非行憲而是要政府早日實施憲政。按政協決議成立國府委員會以，國大代表立委監委均應增加，以爲擴大基礎，婦女與職業亦均應參加爲制憲組織。憲政促進會請蔣主會長，以促進早日行憲。</p>
<p>衛挺生：國父遺敎先地方自治而後行憲，茲已制憲，今後即如何使直接民選與間接民選實現。又立法院權並不太大，政院權料不太小。</p>
<p>范騰宵：建都北平其理由乃就國防，經濟，敎育各點比較，均比南京好。</p>
<p>秦聨奎：人民身家財產應有保護，此在第九十一，十六條均有規定，惟身體自由仍須改進，居住自由，則應保留五五憲草所給予人民的保障。</p>
<p>陳逸雲：（一）應根據總理遺敎五權憲法的精神，（二）基本國策章內，建議增加對保護女工童工之明文，（三）政治·經濟·敎育·職業均應規定婦女機會平等的權利。</p>
<p>拉德那伯德：考試制度對邊疆之分區定額不必修正，憲草乃全國人民的，非一黨一派的，盼各黨各派能犧牲成見。</p>
<h3>政院物資供應局　駁斥美商界抨擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據最近報載聯合社華盛頓電，美商界對我國購買美剩餘資事，抨擊頗烈，謂政府及官吏，用以獲利，造成國內經濟之混亂狀態，行政院物資供應局昨特發表聲明，予以糾正，認爲美商界對中美剩餘物資買賣事件之批評與事實不符。</p>
<h3>國大社會賢達女代表　劉純一在京逝世　患腦充血不治今日大殮</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國大社會賢達女代表劉純一（見圖），陜西三原人，年五十三歲，體質素胖，於三日下午會畢後，返第四招待所，當晚肯德基前，身體尙無異狀，但午夜十二時許，與劉氏隣近之一女代表，突發覺劉氏呼吸有異，乃起　探視，發覺劉已入昏迷狀態，當急以電話通吿大公秘收書處第一招待所及中央醫院等處，旋有國大職員及醫師多人趕來，將劉氏送往中央醫院急診，請値班師檢查，認爲劉我所患係急性腦充血，乃由於血壓過高所致，考其血壓已達一百八十以上，且血已入骨髓，劉當時已呈昏厥狀態，面色通紅，呼吸迫促，經醫師運打強心針及施用其他急救藥品，仍未見效。時大會秘書長洪蘭友聞訊，趕赴第四招待所未見，又急約同市衛生局長王祖祥趕來，醫師已吿以無治愈希望，洪氏乃急令職員多人分頭辦事，並通知共家屬前來，四日晨二時三十分劉即逝世，洪氏至五時三十分始離醫院，六時並派秘書處人員偕劉在京第二子彭啓亞與友好多人，護送遺體至殯儀館，安排後事。四日上午吊唁者絡繹不絕，計有于右任及中國婦運委員會大會秘書處職員，國大代表等多人。記者等於上午十一時半前往，正値國大女代表唐國楨，陳逸雲，張默君，張岫嵐等十餘人，由劉代表遺體房走出，諸代表均面呈淚容，張岫嵐代表更嚎啕大哭，倚於另一代表身上，一面走，一面器謂：「婦運沒有成功你又死了」。其聲甚慘。劉氏遺體定五日午後二時大殮。其二子彭啓亞已赴監察院于院長處哭請表揚其母事蹟。</p>
<h3>北平行轅主任　李宗仁辭職說</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社北平四日電〕報載京電稱：北平行轅主任李宗仁，因體氣不佳，已提出辭呈，李氏擬前往美國休養半年。</p>
<h3>建都運動如火如荷</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　濮德玠　張明</p>
<p>—國大第八次大會速寫</p>
<p>胡庶華拖着一把黑鬍作上午會議的主席，湖南音的官話，萬分難懂，宜布社會賢達女代表劉純一因腦充血於四日晨病故中央醫院，大家都聽不淸，紛相詢問，直到起立致哀時，有的代表還以爲是爲前些時在開封被刺殉命的張炎茂代表致哀。</p>
<p>名字頂長的新疆代表阿布拉哈特馬合素木，慷慨巴辭，一上發言席就得迎頭好，說的話大家不懂，講完時新省代表先鼓掌，大家才跟着來隨後由麥斯武德的二公子麥煥新代表繙譯，全塲對他講話的內容都大爲同情。</p>
<p>靑年黨在上午有三個人發言，第一個何魯之，謙虛地講原則，說國家利益高於一切，要追隨各位之後云云，大會熱烈鼓掌。第二個余家菊。稍微具體一點，說不定這個不宜那個，應如何如何云云。掌聲寥落。第三個王師會，具體主張國在的職權要維持第三章第二七條約規定，會塲子無反應。休息之前孔庚說：「請主席團邀請民社黨的代表先生也講點意見聽聽」！</p>
<p>胡定安要求仿照蘇聨憲法，把人民的保健權和休息權列入憲法，說到蘇憲將懷孕之職業婦女產期前後休假亦制訂於憲法中時，女代表大鼓呂洞賓，女記者儘快記。</p>
<p>建都北平運動，在大會中熱烈展開，已成如火如茶之勢，晉區代表李鴻文和冀區代表吳延環，四日上午均有精彩度演說。李講鋼產量防因素時說：『如果「姓一八」事變時政府在北平，東北軍絕不致擅退入關，日本人也不敢輕易深入，說不定連事變也不會發生』。吳則就近來某一些人對主張建都北平的代表們所作的閑言閑語發表聲明：「第一個閑話，說北方人主張建都北平是狹隘的地方觀念所便，本人是薩溝橋人，我爲何不主張建都在盧溝橋，也可以說「搞戰聖地」云云。我們是中華國民，爲國防才作如此主張。第二個閑話，說我們北方人自私自利，請問：如果到現在還沒有敢說世界已然獲得了永久和平，離願意原子彈落在自家門口。第三個閑話，南京某小報說我們北方代表得了百萬元的賄賂，所以主張建都北平，這話更是不値一笑。總之我們的主張完全是爲了國家的安全與民族的利益，可指天日」。</p>
<p>平職代表周行和座邊的記者羣說：「在外國，沒有發生過國都問題，如今我們發生了，而且形城兩派，這個問題如果不得解決，南方和北方同胞的精神上和感情上一定要發生竟見和隔膜，對國家前途毫無益處。我從北平來的，北平人口實在太多了，政府遷過去物價必然眼着漲，市民生計更困難。我並且相信，如果北平繼續在文化上發展，不被政治鬥爭沾染，一定會有無比的輝煌前途，但是如今不是自私自利的時候了，大家必須要以國家的安危爲重，不然怕有「偏安」的一天。</p>
<p>建都北平的言論接連在大會中出現，主張建都南京的一派卻默不作一聲。這正如參與了憲草審議會的人少有發言的現象一樣。有人說，他們也許在觀望最高當局的意見。但我們的舵手，國民政府的蔣主席，大會的蔣中正代表，已有四五天沒出席大會了，建都問題還是一個謎。不少人推測，結果是把第七條取消，國都的地位不硬性地規定在憲法裏，但是北方的局勢呢？</p>
<p>浙江代表阮毅成，因浙省舉行縣長考試，請假回杭辦理，茲已公畢回京，繼續出席大會。據對本報記者談：「憲草修正案確較五五憲草爲佳，尤其關於中央與地方之權限，及省縣制度部份，爲五五憲草所不及。五五軍草與五權憲法爲二事，不贊成五五憲草，不得謂爲違背遺敎。惟憲草修正案中立法院與國民大會關係，尙欠斟酌。總統制固有缺點，但各立法院長隨時可挾國民大會以威脅總統，亦非所以謀長治久安之道。或則立法院委員由國民大會選席，或則立法委員與國民大公人表同爲普選，但不得互兼，均較爲妥適。至國都問題，最好憲法中不予規定，如明定爲南京，是有不再考慮其他任何地點之意議，將使北方人民失；如明定爲北平，則憲法公布即須遷都，否則便爲過憲，亦屬短時間內人力財力所不許」。</p>
<p>陳立夫永遠是新聞人物，三日午後未出席，被人注意着，四日上午出席了，又遭受新聞記者的包團，十二點散會後從會塲裏擁到大門口，大有脫不得身之概。</p>
<p>王雲五以科學管理的手法來控制會塲，處理得并有條，會斱空氣始終平靜。</p>
<p>國防部以精製巨冊「偉大的蔣主席」在大會上分贈各代表，休息時因爲點心已取消，十分之九是消磨在「偉大的蔣主席」上。</p>
<p>〔偉大的蔣主席〕印製精美，據聞售價是六萬六千元一冊，某代表走出門口就遺失了。</p>
<p>民社黨徐傳霖老人說話，用的是廣東腔，很少人能聽得懂，新聞記者個個把耳朶拉長了，還是收穫無多。昨日本報花絮內有吳經熊提書面意見一條，實爲吳　初之誤，此吳不是彼吳，特予更正。（十二月四日）</p>

<h3>宗教的「淸算」　—祝全國基督敎協進會第十二届年會</h3>
<p>中華全國基督敎恊進會第十二層年會，於一昨召開於上海。我　主席於日理萬幾之身，特頒賀電，有所祝頌，有句曰：</p>
<p>「我國經此戰禍，社會道德備受摧殘，精神建設尤爲重要，深望體基督救世救人之本懷，宣揚眞理，唤醒社會，振銷沈頹廢之人心，樹精進積極之風尙，新中國之建立實所利賴」。可知我　主席對該會屬望之殷。此次基督敎協進會第十二屆年會之召開，聞係抗戰發生後九年來久未舉行之盛會，如今山河重光，秩序未復，各代表相聚一堂，除謀促進敎會事業之開展外，深信封此時會，感慨必多。我　主席在他的實電内所說的：「實揚眞理，唤醒社會，抵消沈頹廢之人心，樹精進積極之風尙，」參與此次基督敎協進會的各代表深信必能三復斯善，有所體會，是　此次全國基督敎協進會年會的召開，不　時　　於基督敎事業的展開，亦　有勸於建國。對於此次大會的召開，我們謹於的表示我們的　賀。</p>
<p>正當會國基督敎協進會的召開的時　，我們又於報端得讀有所謂宗敎「淸算」及所謂「翻身」運動的消息。據中央社紐約三日電，紐約時報記者李博文由徐州來訊，報告中國共產黨虐待大名天主敎堂主敎蔡伐斯情形。據稱：年已五十三歲之老主敎，於中共佔領大名後，被驅逐而來徐州。蔡伐斯曾受淸算審問，由中共審問時，經毒打之後，復判有罪，罰償三十噸榖物，及四千七百萬元抗幣。當蔡主敎表示無力繳納此項罰款時，共黨即將敎堂及所有傢具牲口搶去，並沒收三十三英畝之土地。同時，據中央社西安三日電，共黨近在陕北三邊一帶，厲行「翻身」連勤，向惟子　山橋畔，白泥井，黑樑灣等處天主敎堂逼索敎產，并追索自廿四年以來敎堂之年收租榖及華籍敎土，因不堪壓迫，先後逸亡，中途有在三邊被共罩扣留，備受凌虐者。這些報道的傳來，正值全國基督敎協進會大會召開之時，不免令我們感　多端。</p>
<p>第一，基督的誕生，爲人類帶來了新生。他所遺留給人類的是聖敎會及　祭的建立；由於聖祭的建立，使人類得以日日親近並融合於耶穌。他只　了一個敎會，然而我們今日却看見有一百多種的敎會。有所謂「新敎」，有所謂「舊敎」。我們曉得耶穌在世的當時，他沒有立敎，只创立了一個敎會；所謂「舊敎」應該懂指猶太人所奉的猪太古敎。凡此分歧的現象，使敎外人感到混亂。今基督敎協進會大會召開於上海，這雖然僅能代表所謂「新敎」的各宗派，鑒於目前的形势，同是信奉基督的人而有力量的涣散，似乎是不甚合理的。因此，我們希望他們彼此間能够通力合作。這通力合作的問題，並不涉到信仰。信仰原本自由，本不必從同；但力量似乎不能分散。這是個從戰爭的廢墟上致力建設的時候，尤貴乎合力。英國在戰時有所謂「精神武器」運動(　Sword　of　theSpirit)，合新舊各派於同一旗織之下。美國敎會的聯合援華運動，亦沒有宗派之分。由於此次全國基督敎協進會大會的召開，我們希望他們能有進一步的團結，以集中力量於新中國的建設。</p>
<p>第二，中央社傳來的消息，似决不致於處稱。中共以民主自由相號召，而在中共的區域內却絕對沒有宗教的自由。此項消息的傳來，應該堅定我們所有的若干信念：第一，即共產主義與宗敎是兩種敵對的勢力，我們決不能貽誤自己，吞下了包有糖衣的毒藥。第二，信奉宗敎的人，爲確保他們的宗敎自由，必　將他們的希望，寄予三民主義的充分實現。惟有在三民主義爲建國的最高指導原則下，他們綫有宗敎自由的確保。今　主席及故　總理爲篤信基督敎的信徒固不必話，就是三民主義本身也含有濃厚的基督敎的精神。爲了敎會本身的利益，基督敎會應與三民主義打成一片。三民主義的充分實現就是基督敎精神的充分實現。因此，在宗敎的領域内，基督敎的信眾固然應該身體基督所創的敎義而力行之，在政治的領域内，基督敎信衆，應該對於立國的三民主義多多研究而成爲三民主義的同志。</p>
<p>第三，在文化的領域内，迄至現在爲止，基督敎在我國思想文化上所起的影響，還不甚顯著，而且所有的影響，對於我國的思想文化，未必全是合乎衛生的。皮毛的洋化主義是有害於我國思想文化的健全發展的。我們所要吸取的是以基督敎爲中心的西方文明的精華，而不是它的糟粕。佛敎東來，對我思想文化上泛起了極大的影響，流風餘韻，迄今不衰。然而基督敎一直到今天，還與中國民衆格格不相入。如何使基督敎深入淤中國的泥土，當爲此後基督敎在中國亟需推進的工作。全國基督敎協進會大會今召開於上海，深信對此方面必有精密的考慮。他日我國的民族文化能因基督敎的作用而發生一種新力量及新光輝，胥有望於今茲全國基督敎協進會的召開。所謂「振銷沈頹廢之人心，樹精進積極之風尙」，其在斯乎？</p>

<h3>皖東北辦理急賑　一批災民將予移懇　全省民選鄉鎭長限期辦竣</h3>
<p>〔本報合肥四日電〕記者頃訪晤皖省府秘書長蘇新民，承告皖東北救濟及糧政情形，略謂：皖東北二十四縣，今年遭受水災匪災，情形至爲嚴重，省府巳多方予以救濟，最近中央撥款五億元，作爲急賑，省府乃以四億元按各縣災情分配多寡，因水災最烈，配款原則以水災佔百分之六十五，匪災佔百分之二十五，荒災則佔百分之十，賑款則撥交各受災縣份，由縣政府分交無衣無食之老弱婦孺及赤貧無告者。又中央已撥款二億五千萬元，救濟天長，盱眙，五河，泗縣，靈壁五縣（均屬綏靖區），現社會處長范任在蚌參加辦理中，故在四億元賑款中，即將上述五縣水災配款免去，以求平允。另一億元，則因皖東北刻有災民晋京請願救濟者，現擬將此批災民移至桐城縣屬程瑤湖地方開懇，作爲搭蓋房屋及安家之用，由皖救濟分署代辦交通工具，並配發麵粉，寓有以工代賑之意，亦爲災民謀一長久生活之計，否則縱一次發給驚人鉅款，亦有吃盡用盡之時也。至於糧政，皖省今年徵借共爲四百四十萬石，應繳中央二百零九萬石，中央迭次電令須於年底帶數繳齊，糧部楊司長中明且來省督催，惟本省西南及南部多爲山岳地帶，產糧不多，皖東北則因水災匪災，業經中央令免徵借，皖中一帶產量較多而陷敵最久，勝利雖過一年，民間創痛猶深，徵實工作困難實多。現省府爲達成中央所賦使命，同時又須體念民艱，乃令各縣將縣應得百分之五十之糧食，先行以一部份墊出，繳納中央，以應急需，不過中央期必如數繳齊，而事實上因各地災害，難望徵足此數，尙爲一困難問題。</p>

<h3>海屬大平原　適宜用農業機械</h3>
<p>吳培均請農部就地設廠</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕江蘇海屬同鄉吳培均，以海屬大平原，適宜應用農業機械，近具呈農林部周部長，請准予就連雲市交通便利地方設塲製造，以期革新鹽農兩業，茲探得吳氏呈周部長原文如次：</p>
<p>「竊查吾海統轄四縣，曰灌雲，曰東海，曰沐陽，曰贛榆，爲蘇北最大平原，既無湖沼，又鮮山坡，地勢廣闊，一望無際，古稱海屬爲大農業區，爲麥豆倉庫，誠非慮語。當茲開發蘇北高唱入雲之時，若再能應用新式機械，從事農耕，不獨海屬原有熟田增加生產數倍，而且沿海數千頃之鹽懇地畝得以深耕洩滷，不出三年，亦必變爲沃壤，更有造成棉產中心地帶之可能，因以認定海屬大平原爲蘇北最適宜農業機械之實騐區，頃聞鈞部受聯總委託，設立農業機械製造總塲於上海，設分塲十四處於其他各重要區域，此爲農業革新發懇之始，打破中國數千年之農業傳統紀錄，引瞻宏規，交相慶幸。吾海抗戰八載，農民流亡在外，所有耕種工具泰半摧毀，不幸本年又遭沐河決口之災，更感漂流殆盡，迫不獲巳，叩請鈞部就濱海區域連之雲市，設立農業機械製造分塲，除上述各種理由外，其客觀條件亦甚優異：（一）該市爲蘇皖魯豫四省邊境之中心地帶，以此爲農具製成品輸送出發點，尙屬終南捷徑。（二）與滬濱相距不遠，一蔁可航，所需農具製造原料輸入較易。（三）淮北所轄太平中正臨興濟南之產鹽四塲，昆連該市，其池灘汲水機有待補充，兼籌並願，同時製造，實爲一舉兩得之無上妙策，更爲减輕成本，平衡鹽價，期與長蘆鹽一致之不二法門」云。</p>

<p>上世界文敎會議書</p>
<p>事由：建議世界憲章，應明確規定：「國家對於國民，誚負保育，敎育及養老的完全責任；而其宗旨，應純粹出於博愛，平等，互助，和平，天下爲公，促進人類進貨的大同思想。」</p>
<p>有史以來，世界各國國民之敎育機會，莫不由其家庭的環境，父母的能力，與其個人的遭遇，而生複雜分歧的差別，無法使其一律平等，無法使其普及全人。因此，埋沒無數人才，阻礙進貨速率，减損人類幸福，實在是不能用數字來計算的。這種未能避免的事實，實在是全世界先知先覺者，所共同引爲深憂，而且認爲最可痛心，最堪憐憫的。</p>
<p>有容以爲在全世界尙有國家組織的現在，不要談「敎育文化科學問題」，則也罷了；如要談這個問題，則「國家這個團體，是全國男女國民的父母，全國男女國民是國家的子女」。保育全世界嬰孩，與敎育全世界青年，以達大同的重要條件：「幼有所長」，「壯有所用」……這些最崇高，最偉大，最合理的人類社會的理想，應由各個國家負完全的責任，不應假手於環境複雜的家庭，與能力薄弱的父母，和不可摸捉的遭遇；致全世界無量數優秀健全的嬰孩，和青年，以失「保育」與「敎育」，以挫，以折，以不成材，以傷，以夭：使全世界人類社會，受無量數的損失。此種情形，自古已然，尤以二十世紀以來，交通工具便利，工商發達，世人醉生夢死於資本主義，侵略主義之「强大迷途」，致三十年間，演成兩次世界大戰，五十年間，各國家間各民族間，演成若干次小戰，破壞過甚，貧富各走極端的今日尤爲顯著。試觀全世界無力的家庭，無力的父母，救死猶怕沒有辦法，那裏能夠用合理的，健全的方法，來「保育，敎育」，他們的子女呢？只得委生任運，聽其自生自滅，而無可如何！徒喚奈何？！奈何？！罷了！這種現現實實的事實，尤其是全世界先知先覺者，所共同引爲深憂，而且認爲最可痛心，最堪憐憫的。</p>
<p>查：現代世界各國，雖莫不以「保育國民」，「敎育國民」，爲其重要的國策，什麽育嬰所啦！托兒所啦！……啦！也莫不應運而生；但大多數仍是局部的，未能達到普遍於全人。就是幼稚敎育，義務敎育，雖也莫不有免費的規定；中等敎育職業敎育，大學敎育，雖也有一部分公費或全部公費的規定，類皆枝枝節節，未能澈底；且在私有財產制度未剷除，民生主義未實現，社會經濟仍然畸形發展的現階段，茍無方法使男女嬰孩，男女青年，得享「平等保育」與「平等敎育」的機會，這種枝枝節節不澈底的辦法；於事實是沒有澈底裨益的；並且，各國的厲行「保育」，「敎育」他們的國民的動機，還未能達到純粹出於博愛平等，互助，和平，天下爲公，促進人類進化的「大同思想」；仍然免不了有許多民族，許多國家，爲着要完成他們「强大的迷夢」，利用青年來做堅强的「侵略」和「自衛」的工具，怎麼自私自利阻礙人類進化的「小康思想」。</p>
<p>有容以爲合理的人類社會，人類國家，人類世界，男女嬰孩出生，即應由「社會保育」「國家保育」，「世界保育」；四歲至二十四歲，這個時期，應由「社會敎育」，「國家敎育」，「世界敎育」。</p>
<p>有容以爲嬰孩受合理的，健全的衛生機關的保育，是嬰孩在合理的人類社會人類國家，人類世界「應享的權利」，斷不該假手於無衛生學識，無充分能力的父母，致營養不良，或衛生失宜，而至於不健全或夭殤。同理，幼年及青年男女，受合理的敎育機關的敎育，也是「應享的權利」，而不是現代通稱的什麽「義務敎育」。</p>
<p>我這個「權利保育」與「權利敎育」的時間，至少應爲二十四年。在這二十四年中的「管」，「敎」，「養」，「衛」大功，完全由國家負責，把他們個個「保育」，「敎育」成健全有用的人才；二十五歲以後，到了六十歲，這三十五年，應該純粹爲人類進化而服務。我國父孫中山先生所謂：「人生以服務爲目的」。就是指這學識，能力强壯的三十五年。六十歲以後，精神體力漸衰了，又應該享受「養老的權利」。這時「老者是父母，世界，社會，國家，是子女」了。</p>
<p>我以爲惟有「權利，義務，這樣平等的」，才是天下爲公的大同社會，大同國家，大同世界；這種合理，健全的社會，國家，世界，才能歷久而不變，萬古而常新。</p>
<p>原來，人類生下來，便享有「保育，敎育，和養老的權利」。不過在從前，是由參差不齊，並且不健全的家庭，和參差不齊並且不健全的父母，子女，來負擔這些義務；現在我的主張，是由整齊劃一，而且健全的國家來負擔罷了。雖然，直接是國家負擔而間接都是社會和世界負擔的呢？所以我覺得這個主張直接應該建議於國家，而間接應該建議於社會和世界。</p>
<p>最後，我以爲：「合理的人類社會，人類國家，人類世界，眞正平等的，「權利，義務」，必如是，乃能實現：眞正合理的「人類社會，人類國家，人類世界」必如是，乃能永久和平，合理進化。（台灣吳有容）</p>

<h3>美對西班牙政策　遵守不干涉原則　反對採取壓迫行動與法蘇意見衝突</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約二日電〕美代表康納利今日在聯大政治委員會中聲明，美國昨日所提關於西班牙之決議案，意在恢復該國之民主政府，並無建議干涉之意。康氏指出：（一）美國反對弗朗哥，歡迎該國有保護人權及自由之民主改革。（二）若弗朗哥政權威脅國際和平與安全時，美國願意依據憲章，參加任何必要之制裁行動。（三）在發生前項狀態前，美國反對由聯合國採取壓迫之行動如斷絕外交關係等；蓋此等行動可以促成弗朗哥之團結國內人民以對外，或促成西班牙內戰之發生，使其人民陷入痛苦。（四）美國當繼續反對弗朗哥政權參加聯合國機構，及由該機構所發起之國際組織。（五）最後美國相信西班牙人民應百行決定其命遝。康納利力言美國完全遵從不千涉之原則，此乃美國外交政策之基本要點，並謂渠於昨日所提之決議案，亦並無與該原則衝突之處。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三日電〕聯大政治委會今日討論西班牙問題，歷六小時以上，然後休會至四日續開。英美不贊成聯合國對弗朗哥西班牙採取直接强迫行動，因而與法國及蘇聯集團發生尖銳的分裂。法蘇等要朮聯合國全體會員國立即對弗朗哥絕交，美國認爲此種嚴厲行動，可導致另一次戰爭。英代表蕭克魯斯贊同美國之提議，即要求弗朗哥下野，擁護臨時政府，再代之以自由選舉的政府。據稱，英國不出以任何行動，促使爲西班牙政府問題而流血，不管所流者爲英兵之血或西班牙人之血云。</p>
<h3>康納利提案　兩面不討好　弗朗哥政府提抗議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社馬德里四日電〕西班牙外長奧泰耶今日以照會一件，交與美國駐西代表，內容對於美代表康納利要求禁止西班牙參加聯合國各組織一項提案，表示抗議，謂此項提案觸犯西班牙人民。西班牙現政府係於一九三六年七月樹立，乃在抵抗共黨專制之戰鬥中，以血的代價換來，全國人民類能道之。西班牙現政權戰時絕未參加軸心國作戰，參加德軍之西班牙義勇軍僅及西國軍隊總額百分之二。蘇聯軍隊中亦有「國際師」，西班牙不過援其先例，而准許義勇軍應募云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：西班牙流亡共和政府總理季拉爾，與法國職工總會秘書長佐赫，今日均提出警吿稱：茍聯合國大會對於西班牙問題不能獲致積極解決辦法，則應採取「直接行動」以推翻弗朗哥。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖三日電〕西班牙共和國臨時政府總統李培爾，今日向本社記者談稱，美代表康納萊在聯大政治委會關於弗朗哥西班牙之提案，驟視之下甚爲軟弱，並不提出任何具體方案，以便結束弗朗哥政權。西班牙共和國人士對於美國此種態度，不能不表失望，至於康納萊在議案提出後發表之言論，更爲捕風捉影云。</p>
<h3>統一德境經濟計劃　英美將邀請法蘇參加　四外長週內討論對德和約</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約日電〕英外相貝文今日招待記者，謂英美所訂統一德境兩區經濟之協定，可使英國因對德負担而引起之經濟困難，開始消滅。貝文力言該一協定並非針對任何其他政府，純以需要爲出發點。又美國務卿貝爾納斯亦在另一地點招待記者，表示美國願與蘇聯或法國訂立類似之協定，或參加經濟合併之計劃一。深信此項協定訂立後，可使失業人數減少，糧食增加，秩序更趨安定。貝氏復解釋謂，該一協定已將德國之入口別爲兩種，（一）爲防止疾病及不安所必需之入口，（二）爲維持自給經濟制度所必需之入口。兩區之出口物所取得之外匯，由一共同機構管理，用以一儘先支付第二類之入口。按該協定於一九四七年一月一日起有效一，，僅以經濟部份爲限，故兩區之政治仍繼續保持獨立。一〔中央社巴黎四日專電〕法國半官方人士於論英美兩國統一德境佔領區之協定時稱，該項協定，將不致改變法國之立場，法國迄未同意法佔領區亦在統一之列。法國對此問題之立塲與前所表白者無二，即法國在即將舉行之外長會談討論有關魯爾區之將一來問題時，將維護其立塲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約四日電〕外交界人士今日申稱：外長會議現正努力完成五個軸心附庸國之和的，惟和約之簽訂，殆必將展延至來年初，因印刷和約之最後正式全文，尙有機械上問題。現四大國均希望在日內結束此五國和約工作，而於週杪以前，即着手約略硏究對德和的之初步問題。四外長已定明年初在歐洲舉行會議，討論德國問題，五附庸國和約，或將延至彼時方能簽訂。英美商妥德境佔領區經濟合併協議，似已增强其對蘇法折衝之地位。</p>
<h3>聯大重討論　普遍裁軍案</h3>

<h3>傳史達林病危　繼承人選又起猜測　蘇聯各報大捧莫洛托夫</h3>
<p>〔聯合社伊斯坦埠三日電〕此間報紙今日又登載史達林元帥病重消息。據寨寧政治訪員自負責方面得悉：史達林病勢沉重，蘇聯全部要人及史氏至友均已隨侍在側。史氏自今春罹疾以來，迄未康復，病勢現日益沉重。泰斯維報亦載稱：據保加利亞京城政界消息，史達林病勢惡化，醫藥罔效；惟所患何病，兩報均未指出，另據最近自莫斯科歸來之某要人稱：史達林之健康問題諱莫如深，各報登載莫洛托夫外畏之照片，日甚一目，頗堪玩味。上月七日莫斯科來電稱：史達林政躬康泰，正在假休息。此一電報因受檢査，延擱十二日之久。</p>
<p>蘇聯各報試謀挑選史達林之繼承人，對於莫洛托夫最近入選蘇聯科學院榮譽學員一事大爲捧塲。多數外交家及其他人士以前揣測莫氏不致繼承史達林爲蘇聯元首之人，茲鑒於蘇聯各報捧之爲史左氏右手觀感因又不同。史達林並未出席十月革命紀念大會，外國方面認爲史氏或將退休，對其繼承人紛加推測；但以下列六人最爲可能：（一）馬倫柯夫，現年一四十五歲，昔爲共產黨政治局局員，今年十月起，始由黨部工作調任行政工作，任部長會議副主席，有「權力藝術大師」之目，所處地位與一九二四年列寗逝世時史達林所處地位相似。（二）日丹諾夫，爲純粹黨部工作人員，曾任史達林駐列寗格勒代表，於保衛列城之戰有功，今年革命紀念日且代表史氏發表演說。（三）貝里亞，喬治亞邦人爲史達林之同鄉，主持蘇聯原子能發展機要工作。（四）安特萊夫，集體農塲指導者。（一）米高揚對外貿易部長。（六）卡岡諾維支，部長會議副主席，係猶太人，今如果由莫洛托夫爲史達林繼承人，則殊出意料。</p>
<h3>魯易斯出庭聆判　藐視法庭罪成立魯氏當庭抗辯　礦潮未戢貨運禁止郵包亦限制</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕魯易斯態度强硬，定今日出庭，聽取法官高爾斯勃魯對其蔑視法庭禁令罪宣判處罰辦法。處罰之輕重，悉聽法庭自由決定，可處以任何徒刑或罰鍰，在法律上並無限制。魯氏之礦聯會亦被控蔑視法庭禁止罷工令，可能遭遇絕大的財政上懲罰。魯氏定午後三時（上海時間午後十一時）再度出庭聆判。據熟悉情形之官員向新聞記者談稱：助理檢察長孫納德之僚屬，均贊成罷工賡續一日，即一對礦聯會按日判處罰鍰二百萬元，並對魯易期嚴處量鍰或徒刑。一但法官仍徴詢政府意見，並請魯一氏之律師提出建議，此舉在美國法院雖不常見，但非絕無先例。一法院尙未判決，魯氏律師擬具計一劃，以便迅速上訴，反對聯邦法院之判決。有工會組織之勞工現一均爲魯氏聲援。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕礦聯一一會主席魯易斯今日被法院判決犯一一藐視法庭罪，同時煤礦工潮仍在一一繼續進行。魯氏聞判後，即在法一庭發表反抗演說，指責法官剝奪一一煤礦工人在憲法上所享權利，並一宣言將堅持此項立塲。經此戲劇一一式之一幕，法官高爾斯勃魯在鴉雀無聲之法庭內沉思約四分鐘，即宣吿退庭。至明日宣判如何處罰，依照法律規定，可判處罰金或監禁。政府方面正努力應付煤礦工潮，除必要之貨運外，概行禁止，並將鐵路燃煤機車拖帶客車之行駛哩程再减少百分之廿五。郵局對包裹類亦實施嚴峻之新規則，自本星期五起，限制包裹大小，並禁止投寄海外包裹郵件，惟寄交美國軍人者不在此例。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕民主黨參議員約翰斯登本日訪杜魯門總統，要求總統發表廣播演說，籲請煤礦工人復工。民主然參議員豐勒談稱：聯邦法庭宣判魯易斯蔑視法令之罪，就美國法律而言，並不合法，故可能撤消。</p>
<h3>奧克蘭市區發生總罷工</h3>

<h3>應付世界競爭　蘭開夏棉織業　將澈底改革　政府墊款換裝新機</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社孟却斯特三日電〕英商務大臣克利浦斯今日宣布五年計劃，刷新並發展蘭開夏郡棉織業。依照計劃，棉織廠商凡欲淘汰舊機換裝新機者，政府墊款四分之一，不取利息。此項辦法僅適用於擁有五十萬紡錘以上之工廠，政府計劃之最大目的，在合併較小之工廠而增加其效力。克氏指出英棉織業老大不堪，若不革新，將漸歸淘汰。當十九世紀時，棉織業爲英國第二大工業，僅决於煤礦業，彼時蘭開夏各棉織廠雇用工人卅五萬名，今日　剩廿萬名，出產低落。生產减少原因甚多，機器陳舊要爲主因，英國各紡織廠機器大部份均爲五十年以上古覽，工人利用此種機器極感困難，遇有機會均改就其他摩登工業。同時，二十世紀以來其他各國，尤其是日本印度與巴西紡織業之發達，成爲英國之勁敵，益顯英國之落伍。英政府當前之問題，乃在增加出產，以應付世界競爭。增加出產唯有兩途，即增加工人或換裝機器是也。</p>

<h3>各國可獲賠償若干　將取決於遠東委會　日人關心其商船隊命運</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京四日專電〕中央社今日單獨獲悉：日本被准許保留之工業機器，較諸鮑萊向杜魯門總統建議之賠償計劃或將多百分之廿五；被准保留之較大商船，則較鮑萊計劃或將多百分之卅三。盟國究將自日本取得多少種賠償、目前胥視華府遠東委員會之決定。該委員會於遇去二月來，曾不斷接獲麥帥之意見，以較長時間之硏究及不斷修正之統計作基礎之麥帥建議，較諸以盟軍總部於佔領初期所供之相率統率爲基礎之鮑萊計劃，似更可能成爲遠東委員會及其附屬組織作最後決定時之參考。就日本所需維持最低平時經濟之工業機器與設備之總數而言，麥帥建議之數字較鮑萊爲多；前者對日本各種工業之估計數字雖與後者不同，但平均較後者估計者多的百分之廿五。再就日政府極感關切之究將准許保留多少商船之問題而言，麥帥建議准其保留二百萬噸，對其中五十萬噸之航行範圍，則不表意見；而鮑萊計劃之數字雖與麥帥相似，但限定所有日商船均須航行於遠東海面之範圍內，此即鮑萊計劃中最使日本憂慮之點。美海軍當局·不列顚帝國及荷法爾國雖曾要求盟國鄭重考慮未來若干年限制日航行範圍之問題，但據悉美國在原則上不欲剝奪日本之航行自由。預料此一重大問題在對日和會舉行前，諒不致有所決定，蓋以此與盟國長期管制日本經濟之重大關係允甚於目前之賠償計劃。迄今所獲給予日太商船噸位之數字約在一百萬噸左右；戰前日本商船總數共有二·七三〇艘，即六百卅萬噸，依照麥帥建議准其保有二百萬噸，則日本可建立等於戰前噸位三分之一之商船。目前日本可用之商船中，有二百十六艘正在大事修理，或泊於外國港口，實際正在行駛者的有三百九十艘，內有四十五艘正用於遣送亞洲大陸及南洋羣島之日僑俘返國。號稱日本造船業骨幹之三大造船公司：日本商船會社，大阪商船會社及山下商船會社，目下尙受本年六月六日盟軍總部指令之限制。日人間大都正在研究盟國賠償行動，對日本商船之未來將產生何種結果之問題。一般認爲除非日本被准許保有合理數額之商船隊，並能自由航行於世界海面，則其不能生存爲現代國家。</p>
<h3>伊朗局勢緊張　內戰一觸即發　蘇丹納總理宣布普選展期</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕大不列士電台稱，此間五萬人參加之民衆大會頃通過決議，要求亞塞爾拜然省當局立即頒佈動員令。該電台復稱，政府軍在鄰近亞省邊界之仁珍城用機關槍向平民掃射。又據本社德黑蘭電稱，亞省珍政府已將武器發交工人，民團及靑年團，以便自衛抵抗中央軍之開入。</p>

<h3>治瘧新藥　效力遠勝奎寧</h3>

<h3>市長召開新聞會議　檢討攤販事件　出席負責人發表意見　切望政府慎重將事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長爲檢討日前因攤販問題而引起之騷擾事件，特於昨日下午四時半，在市府會議室召開新聞會議，向本市各報“責人報吿經過詳情，並向新聞界致歉意。稱由於當時局面過分混亂，竟使新聞記者亦無辜受　，實覺萬分遺憾。關於此次警察態度之失檢，必須予以澈底改善。深望各界能儘量供獻材料，保一　市府必嚴做到。</p>
<p>至於此次因取締攤販而引起之軒然大波，各報均曾有詳盡之記載。總之，此番事件並不簡單。因一爲黄浦警局所拘禁之攤販，於十一月三十日中午十二時前已全部釋放其間並無餓死凍死情事，血暴徒則趁此機會散佈謠言，火肆破壞，令人憤怒異常。本人對於當時軍警之服從命令，不開實槍，因而未釀成滔天火禍，對彼等之忍耐工夫，本人甚爲感謝，至於當時少數警察之蠻然動武，實由於實地情緒之激動，此亦係人情之常也。</p>
<p>吳市長繼謂，新聞界於報導事實眞相時，希望注意兩點：（一）是否眞有其事？——如凍死，餓死，警士開槍等。（二）被流彈中傷之無辜市民，是否確係警士所射擊？因暴徒確曾開檢。若任何市民能提出實據，證明爲士開槍所傷者，本人必予嚴辦。</p>
<h3>攤販迫於生計　實應寄予同情</h3>
<p>大公報王芸生旋即發言稱；吳市長於上任之初，在第一次新聞會議中曾表示對本市一切均有辦法，唯有對攤版問題頗感困難‘因攤販多屬蘇北難民，且皆係逼於生計，實應寄予同情。而此番吳市長毅然取締之結果，必致造成巨禍。騷擾發生之常日，本報記者身受警士侮辱，致報導事實時憤慨萬分，而本人力囑隱忍，以顧大局，文章儘量避免刺激，以免事態擴大，乃國家之不幸，亦爲人民之不幸。故大公報對此事件之記載極爲溫和，然本報同人因此對於本人之抱怨甚大，甚至認爲歪曲事實。一</p>
<h3>王芸生談三點觀感</h3>
<p>事後，經過周密之檢討，認爲警士之態度確屬不合理，而政府之</p>
<p>一般作風亦須加以改進。</p>
<p>（一）中國傳統之政治見解是錯誤的，政府認爲人民必須管制，一律不准違抗，這種觀念最要不得，可能成爲大動亂之導火綫，政府之對於人民，不應是「管理」，「干涉」，而是「帮助」，「服務」。</p>
<p>（二）警察對待市民的態度更應澈底改善。此次攤販事件中，警察對攤販採取的手段是：「管」，「駡」，「抓」，「打」！此乃過去租界時期巡捕房作風，係帝國主義用壓迫殖民地人民之工具。在今日，市長之命令，或司令之手諭，皆不能視爲法律！警察一責在保護市民，對於高樓大厦的一闊人固然如此，對於露宿街道的一貧民亦應如此，因爲他們皆爲爲市民！</p>
<p>農後，王芸生並希望市府當局一能不將此次不幸事件之責在，完全推卸於暴徒之身，並且認爲在一騷動中被捕之市民，須鎮靜處理，更望吳市長從寬法辦。</p>
<h3>政府未盡保護之責</h3>
<p>新聞報詹文滸謂：此動亂起因於取締攤販故欲加檢討，必須明取締攤販之目的何在市長取締中區攤販，旨在改善交通，事關大衆福利，故本人表示贊同。對於因而釀成暴動，而於大混亂中，公司商號如高生大約店等竟而受毀，本人極爲憤慨。無論如何，政府之未盡保護之責，應當認爲憾事。希一望今後警察能多盡保護之責。</p>
<p>東南日報劉子潤繼即報吿彼於上週六在中正路上被羣衆圍毆經過。謂當時雖至昏厥，而清醒後，力避字面上之刺激。對於攤阪一問題，認爲是經濟問題，希望市一府能站在經濟之立塲上取得解決一排後路，故挺血走險，在所難免一矣。劉氏最後表示，因爲此次騷動發生後，市府取締攤販更應澈底做到，以顧全政府之威信。</p>
<h3>市長謂暴動雖息　陰謀者仍然存在</h3>
<p>最後，吳市長對於上述發言者之意見表示感謝，並聲明市府之取締中區攤販，旨在改善交通，而決非整飭市容。今後黄浦老閘兩中心區內，仍予禁止沿路設攤，唯准許其於不妨礙交通之公私空地上繼續營業。並謂暴動雖已平息，而陰謀者仍存在，今後自當加緊防範，而亦望市民能不受鼓動云。</p>
<h3>宣局長招待記者　報告攤販案經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察局長宣鐵吾，昨午三時在該局招待各報社記者，報吿此决取締攤販所引起之風波，及其處理經過。略謂日來一般市民及輿論界頗一多誤解警局措置，而將責任加諸黄浦分局，然事實上。取締攤販一，早經市府明令公佈，而於十一月一日起由警局執行，故起因並一不複雜，範圍亦不大，若無搗亂一份子滲入，原可迅速解決。總計三日來被搗毁之商店，計黄浦區十四家，老閘區三十十八家，新成區二十一家，邑廟區二十八家，虞家灣區）家，虹口區二家，北站區六家。受傷警官七名，長警三十三名，被捕之嫌疑犯，除釋放者外，其餘情節較輕者將送地檢處，另有十名決送警備　軍法辦理。警局爲顧　攤販生計，且曾呈准市府，在不妨碍交通秩序下，可在公私空地上集中營業。同時並與衛生局商妥，在各菜塲落市後准予設攤，此外沿浦江一帶及每日上午八時前，若干地區亦可擺設油條　飯攤云云。</p>
<h3>方主委募款救濟　貝總裁等表贊同　許士騏昆仲合捐廿萬</h3>
<p>市黨部方主委，對於此次因攤販請　而受傷之無辜市民及　　徒焚燬之萬生大商號，　爲關懷。昨日上午分訪中央銀行總裁貝一祖詒，中央信託局局長劉攻芸等一諸氏，请予發起募款救濟。諸氏一俱極表贊同，比即發動各該行局一職員開始捐募，一時認捐者極爲踴躍。</p>
<p>又许士骐教授致函方主委，对　募救济，深表同情。特与兄　臣合捐助廿万元，请转高生大高成錫君。表達慰問之忱。</p>
<h3>摊贩筹组联谊会</h3>

<h3>新新公司職員　擠滿旁聽席上　注意李澤案發展　李對出任偽職強調爲策反工作　檢舉人當庭力加辯證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新新公司總經理李澤，勝利後被職工聯名檢舉，列舉通敵罪狀。指有漢奸嫌疑，經本市高院審結，於本年六月八日判處李澤有期徒刑三年。李奉判不服，上訴最高法院聲請覆判，而檢舉人對上項判決亦感不滿，於六月十七日具狀聲請原檢察官提請最高法院覆判，惟檢察官未予置議。現最高法院已將原判撤銷，發還更審。昨日下午由高院楊鼎推事開庭調査，並傳原檢舉人舒月橋韓武城詢問。旁聽者擠滿一庭，多爲新新公司職工及李澤親友。審訊自二時四十分至四時完畢。庭論改期再訊，被吿還押。</p>
<h3>紛紛攝鏡頭　李澤有窘色</h3>
<p>李澤昨戴眼鏡，衣咖啡色條花呢長袍，足穿、黑直貢呢鞋，法警押上庭後，攝影記者即對準照相，李見狀側首避之，攝影記者乃左右分開，各據一角，李避無可避，遂低頭視地，或仰首上顧，狀態頗窘。</p>
<p>對庭上所詢，供稱：現年四十三歲，廣東中山縣人，在新新公司服務已十七年，剛進去時做副經理，自民國廿三年起做總經理，日人在未進租界前，預備強買新新公司，當時中日報紙皆有記載，新新公司亦有聲明。待日軍進佔租界後，形勢不佳，即常有不三不四之日人前來騷擾，在此情形之下，即與董事會商量如何應付，有日人</p>
<p>伊籐益三者，爲益記洋行老闆，與新新公司向有往來，乃商請應付辦法，後由伊籐介紹日人木下豐前來，名義上聘爲顧問，實係僱員。以應付日軍人浪人之騷擾。該事經董事會通過，上决開庭時已由董事長金宗城到庭證明，木下豐之月薪爲「軍票」五百兀，直至卅三年上半年始不復再來。關於僞全國商業統制總會事，係在卅二年三月十五日開始籌備，由僞國防會及實業部議定名單，分別指派籌備委員，我收到聘書後，非常爲難，因爲如果答應，將來政府要追究，如不答應，貝環境困難，結果與常來新都飯店素有聯絡之軍統局聯絡員黄瑞棠會商決定，不如</p>
<p>將計就計做反奸工作，一初任籌備委員，以後做理事，直到卅四年八月勝利時爲止。商統會所開卅三次會議中，我參加多少次，已記不淸楚。但有聲明必要者，即從來沒有發言過和提過案商討決定兩一統制方案事我不知道。商統會辦理物資出入許可手續之機構，其前身爲日人所辦之「軍配組合」一，可分二時期言之：在卅三年六月一日以前並無統制會，當時祇有各業組織之專業委員會。至六月理監事任期屆滿，由偽實業部商討改組後，始決定另辦米糧食油等統制委員會。其主任委員皆爲商統會之常務委員，故卅三年六月以前，根本沒有</p>
<p>統制物資工作。六月以後，則另外設立各種統制委員會負責之。當時理事之報酬爲每月支取四千元車馬費云，庭上詢以常初旣是被迫參加，以後爲什麼不脫離？李答：這不是脫離不脫離的問題，因爲旣加人則是有計劃的，有協助工作要做。我做理事，根本是虛僞的。在未加人前已開始工作，對軍統局方面供給情報。庭上問是什麽情報？答是關於商業公所曉得的事情。楊推事問：有軍統局負責人可以證明嗎？李答可以，除軍統局有案可査外還有經手人黄瑞棠陳豪可作證明。至此詢問僞商統會理事部份吿一段落。乃問三十三年九月將新新公司水汀鐵管等獻敵事。李答：這在初一審時已有人證物證等解釋得很淸楚，這並不是獻鐵，亦並不是</p>
<p>供給敵人新新公司拆下之二百多個水汀，共二萬多斤，放了幾年，因爲敵人開始徴用水汀鐵，乃預先出賣於森大鐵廠。到庭之兩檢舉人新月橋韓武城，韓爲新新公司同人，舒前服務新都飯店，但因行爲不檢而被開除云。至此，楊推事即命李澤一旁稍坐，傳問兩檢舉人。</p>
<h3>搜刮物資　獻鐵與敵　兩檢舉人證述經過</h3>
<p>舒月橋稱：現年三十七歲，浙江慈谿人現失業，飾在二十三年進新新公司服務，至三十二年調新都飯店，因小賬客賞由資方秘密分派，同人甚爲不滿，乃推我爲代表，向公司要求公開分派，去年四月十五日李澤利用僞老閘警察分局特高科日人小山，用槍逼我寫悔過書退職。公司聘任之木下豐顧問爲敵攻打廣州灣之退伍海軍大尉，李澤欲借此聯絡敵偽，偽商統會則爲統制物品搜括物資之機關，李任理事職至勝利爲止，所稱水汀鐵賣與森大鐵廠，是偽造證據，因爲當時物資受統制，且禁止搬運，李將所有水汀鐵獻予日人，由日本軍用卡車裝去，全公司人都知道，李所稱完全狡辯云。</p>
<p>韓武城稱：二十五歲，江陰人。現爲新新公司職員，已服務八一年，李聘任木下轉爲顧問，主要在聯絡敵人，以求收括物資之方便，木下豐在新新旅館四樓四〇五號設有辦公處，後因侵佔房屋吃官司，就此不來。李稱因當時有日人常來搗亂，乃聘用日顧問應付，但爲何大新先施未用日顧問，獨新新有之？僞商統會是統制淪陷區物資機關，直屬偽行政院。李稱將水汀賣予森大，全係僞造。舒月橋被逼退職之事，舒已說得很淸楚，此爲過去之事，但可聲明者，此與檢舉人之立塲並無關係。前所呈之兩證件，其一爲證明商統會收買紗布之罪惡，另一送禮簿，係在新新罐頭部檢得，上載不時送禮予僞實業部長梅思平，以作勾結。昨韓並當庭補上三里文，其中關於獻鐵事一記述甚詳。</p>
<h3>李澤再作一番辯論</h3>
<p>庭上續提李澤詢問。李稱：收買紗布事並非商統會決定，由汪精衛與日大使聯合發表談話，並在報端公佈收買辦法，此事我事前不知，事後據唐壽民吿稱，唐與聞蘭亭爲顧及商民方面痛苦，幾經交涉，爭回由商統會辦理此事，以有通融餘地，商統會並定有補救辦法，即半織品與交織品不在收買之例。工廠可留三月用量之原料，商店可留一月。我得此訊後，即通知許多工廠商店，棉紗棉布曾得逃避很多，當時曾因此有人寫信報吿唐壽民，說我破壞統制，庭上一如要證明，可問唐壽民。送禮予一梅思平事我不知，因總經理之下　，尙有副經理及事務主任等，此種零零碎碎之事，我不知道。關於木下豐辦公地點在新新旅館四〇五號則根本無此事，木下　在商塲四樓有寫字間，且不常來。一所稱因侵占房屋被判徒刑事不知一，其不來之原因，係因僞府將租一界收回後，無事可做，乃辭去營一商。關於舒月橋所說之小賬問題，口裏所講，不足憑信，出售水汀鐵事，已開過四次合議庭，審得很詳細。並由潘序倫會計師將雙方賬簿査過無誤。至任僞上海市第一區總聯保長，係自卅四年六月至勝利爲止，祇做二個多月，亦有相當作用云。詢問至此，被吿之辯護律師當庭遞上呈文一件，庭論關於協助策反工作等事，尙待本院調査，本案改期再訊。李蒙准接見家屬略談後，仍由法　押回忠監</p>

<p>潘鴻奎問敝人有祖遺房屋數幢，戰前由家母經手，將其中一幢出租，當時未立任何契的，至廿九年敝人欲將該屋收回白用，而承租人一味延宕，後竟藉口未定契約，而拒絕遷讓，請問（一）在法律之觀點上，將租出之房屋收回自用，是否合法？（二）無定期租賃，承租人是否可以長居不遷？（三）房票上所載明之簡章，法法律上有效否？（四）拒收房金，可吾促承租人遷讓？（五）如承租人對敝人之請求置之不理，應如何對付？</p>

<h3>彌補產紗原料之不足　政府決購大批外棉　進口後分配國民營各紗廠應用　訂購金額達美金兩億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕据悉：政府刻衡度國棉生產收購情形，及國民營各紗廠產紗所需之原棉數額，決將訂購大批外棉，以補我國產紗原料之不足。聞首批核定訂購外棉之金額，數達美金二億元。對該笨鉅額外匯之流出，政府刻正考慮如何增加我國主要出口貨之外銷額，以資彌補。將來該批外棉進口後，將交由紡管會妥予分配國民營各紗廠應用。</p>
<p>中央銀行總裁兼輸管會執委會主委貝祖詒，特於昨日上午十一時，召集本市外棉進口洋行美安，福家，端記合義等十餘家負責人談話，當吿以政府訂購外棉之原旨，並稱此次政府推行輸入許可制度，外棉之入口，亦需憑許可證，囑各洋行即行準備申請。至許可入口外棉之數額，刻仍未有決定。至各洋行之許可入口額，則將由輸管會執委會分配處，妥予分配。聞訂購外棉之詳細手續，已由紡管會委託中國紡建公司承辦。如各洋行條件不合，開價太高，則常局或將考慮直接向外訂購云。</p>
<h3>六區棉紡公會　商討調節市面</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會於昨日上午十一時召開常務理事會，到王啓宇等十餘人。討論至二時許，始吿散會。聞昨日會議席上，各理事對如何調節紗布市塲，及消滅黑市之方案，紛陳意見，大致不外：（一）恢復棉紗配銷實施以前之自由買賣制。（二）購買外棉所需之外匯，各紗廠可以產紗出口所得之外匯抵補之。（三）目前棉價步漲，實係原棉存底不豐所致。故望原棉能源源供應，各廠願按市價購買。至具體意見，尙待擬就後，提交今日第十五次紡管會例會席上討論云。</p>
<h3>二期南運紗布　日內即將決定</h3>
<p>南運紗布第二期申請登記日期，原定本月二日開始辦理，惟紡管會以上月核定紗布報運數，除輸出外，尙有餘額，此項餘數，現將併入本月份計算，故總數已有增加，同時上月申請參加南遝，因證件不足，退轉複繳之各廠商，現已複齊，業由紡管會核准，本月份起亦亦可申請報遝輸出，是以數量分配，仍須重行核定，故開始申請日期，尙須稍緩，的明後日方可芷式決定，惟南運增加之紗布數量，計紗二千件，布三萬五千疋，紡管會前爲優待參加聯合配銷棉紗之各廠起見，委由六區紡織公會辦理申請核發，本月份援照存案，仍由六區公會核轉，現該會已分函各會員開始申請，計民營報運棉紗數爲一三三四件，國營六六六件，又棉布速同上月餘額共四〇·三一六疋，計民營二六·八七七疋，國營一三·四三九疋，上項紗布，凡參加聯合配紗之廠，均可優先申請輪出。</p>
<h3>紗布平疲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市平靜無波紡建照例掛牌，配售批發紗商。熟門貨只有廿支水月草包一種，價仍一百七十七五萬。塲外喊價亦平。客銷殊爲寥寥，因外埠價與申黑市並行，無利可圖矣。</p>
<p>六區紡織工會‘前以會員中有開紡廿三支棉紗，於上决議價會議決，其價格請照邪惡支紗價加一成計算開售，每件四百磅爲一百九十二萬五千元，業經呈准紡管會。</p>
<p>棉布以客銷仍吿閑散，兼以本街染廠已有適量坯布收進，市塲交易平庸，各檔續呈平疲，龍頭細布貨根稀少，價尙站定，五福藍鷄稍呈軟化，四君子嗶嘰在十一萬元外徘徊。</p>
<h3>浙江桐油漲價</h3>
<p>本市某行商接杭州電話，杭市足度白油，每擔已漲至十三萬五千元，麗龍一帶，每擔爲十一萬三千元，蘭，衡，江，淳等處，每擔自十一萬五千元至十二萬六千元不等，漢口昨日報價，每擔已達十三萬五千左右，聞漢口桐油逕運香港，因之價格大漲。本市出口桐油多係運往美國，價格未能拿走美國市價，惟產地運滬銷售者，寥寥無幾，致本市現貨亦缺，聞實力濃厚之行商，存量一亦不過三五百噸，比之往昔存量一二三千噸，已不可同日而語。</p>
<h3>債市平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨稍回穩，成交一亦增爲四百餘萬元，統丙一三五〇元，福源以及五樓某戶有售，曾低至一二四〇元，七樓某戶逢低來進，回升至一三七〇元以上，始轉徘徊，結果較前收甲乙丙各升五十元，統丁三十元，而統戊尙平。</p>

<h3>本市高利貸盛行　游資集中　各地紛紛匯款來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市高利貸盛行，利率之高，仍爲全國之冠，各地遂紛紛匯款來滬，拆放比期。又以本市黄金證券等交易頻繁，無形中已使本市成爲全國游資集散之地。據中央銀行辦理內匯統計，該行每月承匯各地資金來滬之總額，恒在二千億元以上。至其他行莊及外埠旅客携帶現款來滬之數額，估計每月的爲中央銀行內匯總額之倍，即四千億元。至本市資金每月匯向外埠之數額，與匯人額相較，的爲三與七之比。本市資金外流途徑，以華南方面佔最多數。</p>
<h3>食油到源湧旺　粳秈產價堅挺</h3>
<p>米市南北共到一萬四千餘石，產地價格堅挺，市銷尙可，南北粳一致上升千餘元，蘇嘉路一帶南粳來貨較稀，是以同里吳江藜里等白粳均漲二千元強，幣米挺秀，白的元陰元則提高殺次，麺粉廠盤照舊，雜牌粉貨稀，加一老一輩元，市銷動而不旺，小麥依然穩堅，麩皮仍疲，豆餅　　不濃，價格平庸，菉豆來貨不多，南洋略取，開趨活潑，赤豆仍少榮辱，黃豆來去兩細，管理人才一南洋仍懈，本街零化不爽，芝麻廣幫納胃尙佳，市面穩固，油市近因到源湧旺，尤以青島桐油獨多，店胃看望，供過於求，步跌不已，生油豆油均趨續下挫三四千元，菜油蔴油平平。</p>
<h3>油廠貸款重行　填寫申請數額</h3>
<p>關於上海市銀行舉辦油廠貸款一五萬萬元事，一切手續，早經該一行擬就，如貸款申請書，互惠保證等，至油廠遲遲未曾申貸款額原因，據悉，按照規定，係按照油廠每月市銷數量爲標準，前次各廠所塡具申請貸款數量，未盡與各廠所負担實銷數量取得配合，因此，未能獲得市府當局審核及格，又悉，榨油業公會有鑒及此，特於昨晨派員逕赴市銀行，重行取得貸款申請單五份，更審塡具各廠貸款數額，一俟市府當局核准，即予實施貸放云。</p>
<h3>複配會退紗減少</h3>
<p>複配會轉配棉紗退單之多，久爲各方所關心，該會亦認爲技術上尙須改進，紗廠來紗，允應注重實用，茲悉其第三期第四期配紗，業已竣事，各業各廠實配淸册，已造送紡管會，其退單中除有合用之紗廿支一件外，計六支九件，十二支一件，十支五四七件，交紡TK四十支五三件，此十支及四二一上壞以TK紗聞係　退屢撥之貨，十支一項，先後已退千餘件，複配會認爲非常棘手，昨日（四日）六區棉紡織公會配紗委員會開會，複配會派員列席，商請改進，棉紡業方面已允予調整，此次第四期第一次配紗，昨日已由各業公會核配與各會員廠，此次繳款，限於星期五日截止，各會員廠紛紛向各該公會表示困難，但公會方面已勸其切實遵行，以免軋脫，據複配會負責人語人，此次六十支紗及四十支TK，不免仍有大批退紗，其四十支TK品質低劣，實係泆採用云。</p>
<h3>呢羢無大上落</h3>
<p>邇日天泠，冬令呢羢銷路不惡，本街客帮各帮進胃尙佳，觀乎大路標準行情，大部份均無大上落，並不因進口登記，及定貨取消等事實，以及外匯不日又欲調整之謠傳而見好轉，其主要原因：（一）來到貨充斥異常，（三）有高利貸之連帶關係，（三）冬季實銷之期一天减少一天，（四）國曆年底轉瞬到臨，賣買雙方均不欲擱存手貨，故預料呢羢市面內難望恢復前此最高峰時代。</p>

<h3>松花江上的悲調</h3>
<p>— 十一月廿四日航訊　本報瀋陽記者趙展</p>
<p>蔣主席頒佈停戰令到達東北於十一月十一日正午起生効後的一週間，中長鐵路北段又復緊張起來。共軍欲以破壞北寗路的手段加諸中長路，企圖經常阻撓長瀋問的交通，集結了一萬以上的兵力潛伏於公主嶺至四平間的鐵道側冀。就在這時候，東北保安司令長官部參謀長趙家　夫婦作吉林之遊，名爲視察小豐滿發電廠，於十九日抵長，二十一日去永吉，因二十二日上午杜章明長官應召飛京報告最近東北軍事，趙氏乃匆匆趕回長春，二十三日晨返瀋。同去小豐滿者尙有東北電力局局長郭克悌，記者亦隨往作一日之巡禮。</p>
<p>吉林山川人物</p>
<p>松花江上，她槃牢東北旅人的客子遊懷，牽引着東北人的鄕愁鄉應。九一八後的十四年間，她在流亡到關內的東北人的口中被歌頌。</p>
<p>我到松花江，松花江水靜靜地流，松花江的柔情勝過於明媚的江南山水。</p>
<p>坐在杜長官率軍出關時所乘的專軍上，遊覽着窗外景物，今天的吉長道上，展開在旅人眼前的是戰爭的痕跡，每一個橋樑與涵洞都武裝着，東北人不明白，爲什麽「八路」要「扒路」？爲什麼中國人在勝利之後要走向戰爭？</p>
<p>自長春出發，便由吉林西部的平坦原野走入東部的山丘地帶，山岳地帶還在永吉以東，沿途是起伏不平的丘陵，疏疏地人造林地帶，這一帶每年出產大量的木材和大豆。往年森林的保護及土地的利用都能有計劃的施行，現在這方面的行政効率降低了，林木在砍伐，匪徒時出沒，我很怕這一片光復後的自由天地又恢復到九一八以前的舊觀，而不能前進一步。</p>
<p>到達永吉的時候已是下千兩點鐘，到車站歡迎的人有主席梁華盛，六十軍軍長曾澤生，三十八師師長李鴻等，旋即驅車往松花江招待所赴梁主席邀宴，記者以</p>
<p>爲是「勝利餐」，到後才知道是「白魚宴」。（按，梁主席規定以勝利餐招待初來的客人，勝利餐者僅高梁米及牛肉，這次是豐盛的酒席，有松花江的特產白魚）</p>
<p>建設新吉林，梁主席有他的目標和堅定的信仰。他說共產黨把吉林搞得半身不遂了，他要建設一個完整的吉林。底下我要介紹所見到的政績，有一點特別値得介紹的，是梁主席把戰時後方的潮氣帶來了，每天四點鐘就起床，訓練幹郃，開辦學校，是靑年人的作風，黨團工作做得很好，使吉林人民覺得他們離中央很近，吉林在向新的前途邁步。</p>
<p>我特別介紹一下三十八師師長李鴻少將，他可以作爲在吉林的國軍的代表。李鴻的名字與關內的很者並不生疏，他就是第一個率兵遠征入緬甸的第三十八師一一四團團長李鴻將軍，率領三湘健兒由西南轉戰到東北，他是湖南湘陰人，沉默寡言，記者與他談話，覺得他爲人純樸坦白，而沒有半點粗浮之氣。他說，他的弟兄都不願意打仗，可是看到東北老百姓對他們那末好，他們覺得解除東北人民的痛苦是一種責任，他的弟兄受老百姓的熱烈愛護感動得太深了打仗像是忍痛割瘡一樣。他說他也很思念家鄕，有好幾年沒有回去了。聽了他的話，覺得軍人並不歡迎打仗，只有在保衛一件東西而必要上上刺刀的時候，他們才有勇敗的精神；同時，民心之背向與士氣之高低有最密切的關係。共產黨在凍北的失敗由於失掉民心，道是眞確的事實，同情共產黨的人都爲共產黨可惜。</p>
<p>宴後去參觀省立吉林體育專科學校，是由獻校運動所籌款興辦的，才開學三天，有學生九十一人，內女生二十一人，體育專科兩班，師資訓練一班，梁主席兼校長，校舍及校中設備，都是在戰時西南少見的，學生的一切費用完全由學校負担。</p>
<p>永吉市的敎育非常發達，有吉林大學及長白師範學院，中學十二所，小學三十所，就學靑年及兒童的三萬人，的佔全市二十四萬人口的十分之一。</p>
<p>然後去參觀吉林省地方行政人員幹部訓練團，因天色已暮，看不淸這所大建築的全貌。全體學員集合在大禮堂中候趙參謀長訓話，趙氏由梁主席引導登台，概述勝利一年間東北共軍割據的形勢，講完之後，大家到會客廳中休息，趙參謀長含笑對記者說：軍人講話有火藥氣息，請愼於發表。</p>
<p>幹訓團是吉林全省行政人員的革命熔爐，所有的中下級幹部都要在裏面受短期的訓練。現在有學員四百九十三人，幷有女學員廿人，表示吉林的婦女已開始參加行政工作。我看幹訓團的精神在於大門口的一付聯對：「是革命的請進來，不革命的滾出去」</p>
<p>參觀完了幹訓團，梁主席引導客人去省政府參觀他的小型廣播電台，這個電台每天有節目播送全吉林各地，電台呼號是XKGL，週率一一六XC，波長二五八·六公尺。梁主席自己開始用廣播命令的辦法，如此减少公文旅行的麻煩，增加行政効率，是獨特的新做法。梁主席說：「我有四位廣播小姐」，隨後找一位廣播小姐來，命她提前一個鐮頭播音，這位矮胖得有點　腫的小姐，隨即用東北腔的國語開始她的節目，她的聲音因爲在主席及許多生客的面前變得不自然了。隨後是梅蘭芳的京調幽怨而凄凉的送入我的耳膜。</p>
<p>冬天裏面的春天</p>
<p>二十二日一早便被邀往朝陽新舍去游泳，現在已經是嚴冬時候了，街上已有薄冰。我們到達朝腸新舍時，我發覺吉林的春天在梁主席建築的游泳池裏。我由冬天走入春天，近視眼鏡便被一層白霧迷漫，我只好取下鏡子，跳下池去游了一回水，上來在早餐桌上裝滿了鷄蛋牛奶。</p>
<p>吉林公務員最高的享受是在淸晨游泳，由梁主席以身作則，他們每天早上游泳之後去上班，梁主席說：如此一天精神很好，九點鐘以後的時間，市民可以化五十塊錢來洗澡，對於健康很有帮助。</p>
<p>朝陽新舍原是僞滿時候朝陽區公所，曾有不少的人在此死於日本警憲之手。「梁主席要把血腥的地方改爲娛樂塲所，改變一般人對殘忍的印像」。省政府秘書處的總務科長宗君這樣解釋。由興工到完成費時一月，化費了二百萬元流通券。道個游泳池是東北第一個，到永吉的人都歡喜它，只是一點不好，每天要燒四噸煤，在東北缺煤的今天，不能不說是浪費。</p>
<p>永吉市面的夜景在河南路，商店都集中於此，入晚燈火輝煌，八時以後戒嚴，才開始有寂寞之感，商業很蕭條，貨物沒有來源，物價上漲，消費的力量大减，所以一般的小商人都沒有出路，呌苦連天。著稱國內的吉林三寳，也不如以館的好景了。好的野山參價値很貴，不大的一個要流通券九萬元，合法幣百萬，貂皮徒負盛名，根本缺貨，烏拉草的身價也比以前高了十倍，好在在吉林它不算稀罕的東西。</p>
<p>永吉的物價也是不斷的高漲，十月　大米（斤）三十七元，小米十三元，高粱米八元，鷄蛋七元一個，木柴一百二十元一祖。十一月份上漲一倍，大米（斤）五十八元，小米二十五元，高粱米十五元，鷄蛋十七元一個，木柴二百元一担。老百姓都被物價壓得呌苦，公務員的生活則因省府供應煤米等實物，比較好些。</p>
<p>小豐滿水電工程</p>
<p>小豐滿的水電工程原是舉世聞名的，在亞洲是第一，佔世界第四位。原有七萬「開維埃」發電機八台，共計發電量爲三十五萬「開維埃」，經八一五後蘇軍運走了六台發電機，目前發電量僅十三萬　，年底可增加至十八萬瓩，刻正計劃添七萬「千伏安」發電機三部，此項計劃如東北時局穩定，海外（運輸不成問題，則三年以內准可以完成。豐滿堰堤工程，尙有百分之十五未曾完工，的需添築混凝土二十萬立方公尺，如洋灰來源不缺，三年之內亦可完工，同時已經完成之堰堤工程，甚爲草率，如遇夏季山洪大雨，便有傾倒之危險，堰堤遠有加工的必要。</p>
<p>蘇軍拆走豐滿發電機，他用了不少力氣，當時動員了日俘二千人及蘇軍一千五百人，自去年九月十五日開始工作，至十一月三日止，共費去四十天的時間，中國工人目睹蘇軍拆走他們的機器，沒有一個不十分氣憤！</p>
<p>日本人建築豐滿發電廠，經過九年的時間還沒有完工，全部完成計劃需要十二年。我們接收以後，要繼續究成豐滿工程，恐怕需要相同的時間。郭局長對廠裏的職工說，希望他們牢守崗位，發揮最大的工作効能，爲國家出力。</p>
<p>看吉林的風景，小豐滿也是個最幽美的地方，在夏天水大的時候，由百米高處注下的江水形成瀑布，呑議吐霧，蔚爲奇觀，現在是冬季水落的時候，高站在　水堤上，上游望如湖汶，下流視如　帶，百米高的堤防攔斷江水，形勢頗壯觀，寫完小豐滿，我需要補充一句，「豐滿發電廠」已改名爲「松花江發電廠」了。</p>
<h3>國父史蹟　紀念館在臺灣</h3>
<p>— 十一月卅日航訊　本報臺灣特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台北長官公署斜對面，在日人過去開設的梅屋敷旅社原址，現在已成立了</p>
<p>國父史蹟紀念館。</p>
<p>民國二年討袁之役國父在上海舉事失利後，即謀去粤再舉，並派黄興預爲準備，國父就在八月二日搭德船「釣克號」離滬至閩。這時粤中情勢急轉，便恂日人多賀之勸，以日船撫順丸來台小作停留，隨行者有胡漢民·戴季陶二先生，自淡水登陸到台北，他們便憩息在梅屋敷旅社。</p>
<p>國父在旅社停留的時間並不久，據稱：大的上午十一時來，下午二時即去。國父不愛多言，只有微笑，食量不多，也不嗜酒。午餐後，國父揮毫，留下了兩幅墨寳：「同仁」·「博愛」，一幅被保存在紀念館裏，一幅還在東京，所用的硯臺，也被珍藏着。在題字後，國父步入庭園，在小假山旁，給攝入了鏡頭，他們便啓程赴基隆，搭下午四時開的船，到東京訪問犬養毅及頭山滿。</p>
<p>台灣光復後，梅屋敷主人藤井以苦心珍藏三十三年的國父墨寳，持贈省黨部李主委翼中，使他很感興的成立了　國父史蹟紀念館。目前組織了管理委員會，李氏兼主委，張延哲·林紫貴·黄國書等爲委員，並由高拜石負籌備的責任。　正如張繼先生所撰「紀念館記」裏說：「台割之歲，國父革命之業始著，今者舊物不失，靈爽在天，寔憑慰薦，履茲館者，徘徊流連其思，所以無愧於國父，永志繩業，光大宗邦，庶幾稱慕之忱，又豈徒爲遊觀地也。」眞的，新生的台灣，是更需要對中國革命更深的理解的。</p>

<h3>流亡曲的變調</h3>
<p>踏上歸途，我並沒有被一夭的勞頓所困惑，綜合這次初旅的印象，可以說是愉快的旅行；但也有不愜意的事，我看到軍調部第卅三小組代表撤退到永吉，美方代表精神都非常喪沮，他們覺很中國的事情沒法辨通，在政府代表看來，小組撤退并不算一回大事情，國共和談之門并未因此關閉，可是美方代表沉不住氣了，他們以爲不得了，一定有重大的事情發生，其際熱悉中國內情的人，決不會因此而無所措。</p>
<p>梁主席曾自己導演了一幕新劇，名爲「松花江上」，內容爲與共產黨進行鬥爭的故事，可惜這一次沒有演出給我們看的機會。</p>
<p>在松花江邊，這一次却又聽到了流亡曲，但調子和以前不同了，雖然同樣是痛苦思戀，可是兩種情緒終於唱出兩種不同的調子　，戰時在關內聽到的流亡曲的歌調是悲壯激昻，現在所聽到的却是國怨哀訴了。這說明什麼！說明東北人的痛苦和失望。有許多自共軍佔領區流亡出來的靑年依然在飢餓綫上徘徊，在對故鄉失戀的感情激盪中唱流亡曲的悲調。</p>
<p>予暴力者以打擊，東北人明白怎樣去做，東北人憎恨任何暴力一如憎恨日本人一樣。</p>
<p>我們回途車經過永吉時，車站上得到情報，說九台車站有匪徒活動。趙參謀長令站上派一列壓路機車，照常前進，一路平安的返抵長春，已經是晚上十點半鐘了。</p>
<h3>從飲食起居　看美國</h3>
<p>— 蕭夫</p>
<p>世界一天比一天縮小，中外的關係也一天比一天密切，中美的關係尤其密切。我們對於美國和美國人不能不加以硏究，而獲取相互的瞭解。瞭解以後，加以比較，看看人家，看看自己。看一個國家或一個人，最好從平易處着眼。天地間事物的眞象，不在其奇特之處，而在其通常的地方。我們從飲食起居看這個國家，而不侈談文化或哲學。况且衣食爲人生之端，從這些地方才能看出普遍的和日常的生活來。</p>
<p>牛奶西餐</p>
<p>此處所指美國人仍然指普通的極大多數的美國人，他們每天必喝牛奶，而且價錢並不貴。在通貨膨脹的現在，每鎊不過一角錢。從嬰兒時喝起，一直到成人，以至於老。吃飯在量上不能算多，但很有養料，早點有幾塊黄油麵包，有一點麥片，好一點的加兩個鷄蛋，午飯不太注意，晚飯比較豐滿一點，每餐有幾一片肉，有些蔬菜。普通的人，或說最簡單的吃法，如此而已。他們日常的吃法，與上海西餐舖的西餐，大不相同。中國飯店的西一餐，比普通美國人所吃的西餐，豐富多了。總之，他們吃飯重養料不重味道。而且普通人的食物都吃的相當的不錯。我不相信西餐有太大的差別。美國總統所吃的飯，不會比普通工人好到多少。最好的菜不過是牛排猪排，鷄腿羊腿之類。特點是雖無人享受山珍海錯，亦無人吃樹皮，所以普通的人身體都很健康。</p>
<p>廁所設備</p>
<p>美國的厠所一律是抽水的。厕水清潔，人不容易生病，因而提高民族健康的水準。茲舉普通一個學校的厠所設備，以概其餘。小便的地方，有小便池，有的是每隔幾分鐘自動冲水的。有的用人去按一下龍頭。自來水和我國戰前一樣，是很流暢的。大便的地方多半是恭桶。照例備有潔白細輭的草紙。恭桶的蓋子怕傳染皮膚病，所以另外備了一種紙，大小與恭桶的木蓋相符，出恭時墊在上面用過就拋入恭桶中，順流而下。厕手裏有洗臉盆，並備有擦手的紙。質料甚優，而且很大，便後洗手。用紙擦手。用紙又比公共的手巾好了。從這件事上，可以斷定有一多少種疾病可以因而預防。</p>
<p>衛生營養</p>
<p>第二次大戰，美國士兵每千人死於疾病的不到一個半人。可見他們在荒蠻作戰的地帶一，對衛生都特別注意，並不把人命當作兒戲，又何况在學校裘呢？</p>
<p>民爲邦本，人口是國家之寳，生命是不能不愛惜的。中國好以人口衆多自豪，這表明認識人口的重要，旣知人口重要，爲甚麽對於營養和衛生又這樣忽略呢？抗戰時學生營養不足，有人指爲係民族的自殺，現在勝利以後，不但要增加學生的營養，並且要增加一般人的營養。或曰中國災民吃樹皮，還談甚麽營養，不過這是病態，我們就眼看着一個民族日趨衰弱麽？</p>
<p>睡覺舒服</p>
<p>談到睡覺，所謂「席夢思」，在中國是特殊而又特殊的人物的享受品，在美國雖不敢說人人都有，恐怕是主普遍了。美國所謂的窮人，也有這樣一架，他們也有洗澡房，晚上洗個熱永澡，舒舒服服的睡覺。據醫學家說，輭床睡六小時，等於硬床睡八小時。夜間有一夜好睡，早晨起來可以多作些工。睡眼不足，工作豈能有效率，這一點更不能求之於中國，只好說說而已。</p>
<p>總之，本文之意，在使讀者知道，美國一般人過的是甚麼生活，我們一般人是如何在水深火熱中打滾。我們急起直追，增加生產，尙且一時趕不上，更如何禁得起再有內亂？</p>

<h3>讀聖詠譯義初稿</h3>
<p>— 姚莘農</p>
<p>蔣主席手訂，吳經熊譯。三十五年十月商務印書館初版，全書二〇一二一面，實價二千一百元。</p>
<p>「聖詠」（Psalms）不僅是一部基督敎的時經；它是人類文藝遺產中一部不朽的名著。它的價値早已超越了宗敎的範疇，深深地滲入了文化的整體；其影饗之廣遠悠長在古今文獻中很少能與之倫比者。所以，我們覺得「聖詠譯義初稿」的出版是文化界一件大事，同時也是中西文化驛路中的紀程碑。</p>
<p>爲基麼「聖詠譯義初稿」値得我們這樣重視呢？聖詠不是早就譯成中文了麼？不錯，中文譯本是早就有了——文言的，官話的，方言的——有許多不同的版本。但其譯筆都謹守着原文的繩墨，在「信，達，雅」三個字中只做到了「信，達」二字，至於「雅」就難以兼顧了。于斌總主敎在本書序文中說：「我國譯本類皆佶屈聱牙，讀之令人生厭。」我們想：凡是讀過中譯聖經的人大概都有同樣的感想吧。聖經譯本在中國流傳了很久，可是在文藝上並沒有發生重要的影響，其原因也就在此。我們知道聖詠的原文是古代以色列民族文學的奇葩，而基督敎國家各種文字的譯本亦皆典麗矞皇，在它們的文學中佔着崇高的地位，猶如我國的詩經一樣。若將原有的華譯聖咏和原文或歐洲諸譯本互相對比，我們就不免顯得太寒傖，太相形見拙了。我們所有的僅是聖咏的糟粕，沒有得到聖詠的神韵。這該是一個多麽大的缺陷！</p>
<p>「聖詠譯義初稿」顯然是爲塡補這側缺陷而作的。譯者所追求的是聖詠的神韵，不是聖詠的軀殼。在這一百五十首的譯辭中我們找不出牽强生硬的字句和生吞活剝的經義。在諷誦時我們彷彿在讀一本山國的古詩集，並不覺得這是以色列聖詠的譯文。即此一端已非率爾操觚者所能企及的了。</p>
<p>這種翻譯的手法當然不能和直譯相提並諭。筆者個人對於直譯和意譯都沒有偏袒，我覺得翻譯的方法應以原文的性質爲準則；假使原文是實質的，直譯當然比較來得確切；假使原文是心靈的，那麽只有意譯纔能達到「傳神阿堵」之妙。聖詠無疑是屬於後一類的作品，吳先生毅然超越了字而的囿禁，以翱翔於玄冥空靈之境，這完全是順着聖詠內在的需求，並不是故意賣弄譯者做古詩的天才。</p>
<p>意譯所最難達到的境界是「得其神韵」，而翻譯古代的作品爲尤雖。因爲作品除神韵之外還有與神韵不可分離的「風格」。一個時代的文學有一個時代的風格，猶如周鼎商　各有其代表時一代的特點。聖詠的作成自公元前十六世紀的摩西至公元前五世紀的馬拉基，前後　一千餘年之久；其時代相當於我國的商周兩朝，其文字之古樸渾厚也只有漢魏以上的詩辭可以和它比擬。我想，吳先生在執筆之先大槪對於譯辭的風格曾作一番審愼的考慮，所以全稿在大體上都採用了漢魏以上的作風。例如號稱「聖詠之聖詠」的第一百十九首，第一至八節：</p>
<p>「樂只君子，心地純潔，遵行聖道，兢兢業業，優哉遊哉，順主之則，惟精惟一，無貳無忒，聖誡彰彰，寗敢荒逸，祈主導我，虔守大法，庶幾無愧，金科玉律，俾得暢詠，主之靈　，正心誠意，惟主是式，但求吾主，莫我棄絕。」</p>
<p>又如第十八首第七至十三節：</p>
<p>「主發怒兮乾坤震，大地顫兮衆岳崩，鼻騰烟兮口噴火，沙石爍兮草木焚，天幕下垂石主親降，足踏陰霾兮雲茫茫，駕神駒而馳騁，鼓風翼而翱翔，披重昏以爲幔兮，假　　而爲宮，陰陽相薄而成雹兮，絳烟起於雲中，顯至尊之赫赫兮，震天怒之隆隆。」</p>
<p>若將上面所舉的譯文和原作對比，讀者就可以知道吳先生在風格上曾費了不少功夫。假使在諷誦時讀者覺得字裏行間都反映着原作的古樸渾厚，那就足以說明譯者苦心孤詣所得的收穫之豐。筆頭上的推崇倒顯得寒傖了。</p>
<p>譯文原著相較　苦心孤詣畢現</p>
<p>風格和神韵本是相依爲命的質素。有風格而無神韵，猶如帆高張而風不競，無以見帆之用。吳先生在風格上旣獲得了上述的造詣，讓我們再檢討一下：他在神韵上是否也有同等的成就？如果我們姑且把前面引過的聖詠第十八首第七至十三節和英譯本及流行的官話譯本做一個比較。我們發見流行的譯本是這樣的：</p>
<p>「那時因他發怒，地就搖撼戰抖，山的根基也震動搖撼。從他鼻孔冒烟上騰，從他口中發火焚燒，連炭也　了。他又使天下垂，親自降臨，有黑雲在他脚下。他坐着　　　飛行，他藉着風的翅膀快飛，他以黑暗爲藏身之處，以水的黑暗，天空的厚雲，爲他四圍的行宮。因他面前的光輝，他的厚雲行過便有冰雹火炭。耶和華也在天上打　，至高者發出聲音，便有冰雹火炭。」</p>
<p>據舊約聖經的記載，這首聖詠是大衛王追憶　昔與敵人及掃羅鬥爭時蒙上帝保佑呵護而作的頌恩詩歌。它的氣質與中國古文學中的離騷最爲近似，因爲它們都是詩人幻想中所孕育出來的麟兒。翻譯這一類的作品，若只求字面的中實而忽略了原作的神韵，那就好比翦除了天馬之翼，敎牠在磨坊裏供驅策！上面所舉官話本的譯文正犯了這個毛病。我們讀時只看見一大堆不可信的荒誕，並沒有空靈飄緲的感覺。反過來說，我們讀離騷時一點不覺得它的誇誕，我們只覺得好像御風而行，飄飄然到了一個超脫的境界。吳先生譯這首聖詠選用了離騷的體栽。我們覺得道是最恰當的選擇。他非但保持了原作古樸的莊嚴，同時也保持了原作天馬行空的神韵。若不是對於聖經及中國古詩辭寢饋有素，這樣勝任愉快的翻譯是不可能的。</p>
<p>參考宏富　允稱傑構</p>
<p>聖詠譯義初稿最難能可貴的成就當然是在「得其神韵」，但其精到處也有非通行的華譯本所能企及的。吳先生在卷末吿訴我們：他的譯文大都根據着斯溫蕾司鐸「聖詠聖歌之英譯」。筆者因與吳先生有師生之誼，得悉他所參考的典籍很多，而且爲審愼起見他曾與精通經學的中西學者反覆硏究，並將每首譯稿與希伯來原文逐句校勘，糾正了不少英譯及中譯本的疵病。茲因限於篇幅，姑舉聖詠第一首第一節及第二節以見一斑：</p>
<p>「不從惡人的計謀，不站罪人的道路，不坐褻慢人的座位，惟喜愛耶和華的律法，晝夜思想，這人便爲有福。」（官話本）</p>
<p>「惡人之謀兮弗從，罪人之途兮弗蹤，悔慢之位不居兮，福祉來降。以耶和華之律法爲悅，思之維之，夜以繼日。」（文理本）聖詠譯義初稿作：</p>
<p>「長樂維君子，爲善百祥集，莫偕無遭行，恥與羣小立，避彼輕慢徒，不屑與同席，優遊聖道中，涵泳徹朝夕。」</p>
<p>關於這短短的兩節，吳先生會在附註中提出了三個値得商榷的詞義。（一）他所譯的「百祥」希伯來原文本屬多數，有各種福祉兼備之義，英譯作Blesseo華譯作「有福」或「福祉」都未能包括原文的涵義。（二）英譯中的Law中譯通作法律，但原文據經學家之研究其義實槪括聖道之全部，所以吳先生決定把它譯作「聖道」。（三）他所譯的「涵泳」在原文有念茲在茲，口誦心維之意，英譯作Meditate華譯作「思想」或「思維」，都不能充分表達原意。又如聖詠第二十二首起首的名句：MyGod　，my　God，　why　hast　thou　foraken　me？（耶穌臨終時所悲呼的便是這一句）希伯來原文爲「伊理，伊理，拉瑪沙巴大尼？」共有十音，吳先生譯作：「主兮，主兮，胡爲棄我如遺？」十字十音與原文巧合，而大衛鬱憤哀訴之情，凄然如聞。華譯舊作：「我的上帝，我的上帝，爲甚麼離棄我？」或作：「我之上帝，我之上帝，何以遺予？」與吳先生的譯辭相較，眞有上下牀之別矣。</p>
<p>這樣的例子差不多在任何一首聖詠譯義都可以找到，不必筆者縷舉。吳先生於風格神韵刻意揣摩，不遺餘力，同時於經義猶能如此一字不茍，精益求精，我們除爲聖詠深慶得人之外，還有甚麽話可說呢？</p>
<p>但吳先生自己却並不覺得滿意。雖然經過了二年的推敲琢磨和蔣主席的三次校閱修訂，他還不肯承認他的工作已吿完成。他認爲這僅是譯義的初稿，希望於刊行之後能　獲得海內外文藝學術界的指正。這樣虛懷若谷的態度非但是譯者學力和素養的註脚，同時也是譯義初稿曾經千錘百鍊的徴騐。即此一端已儘彀說明本書的價値，我們謹以此向讀者作最誠懇的推薦。</p>

<h3>约翰·克利斯朶夫　（下）</h3>
<p>— 葭水</p>
<p>（一）小说的形式史诗的内容</p>
<p>「约翰·克利斯朶夫」分十卷，中譯本四厚册，二三五〇頁，约一百萬字。上面試用不到四百分之一的字數去把它的故事寫出來，不妥之處是免不了的了。况且這書的好處，不在乎它的故事。譯者說：</p>
<p>「約翰。克利斯朵夫」不是一部小說，——應當說，不止是一部小說，而是人類一部偉大的史詩。它所描繪歌詠的不是人類在物質方面而是在精神方面所經歷的艱險，不是征服外界而是征服內界的戰蹟。它是千萬生靈的一面鏡子，是古今中外英雄聖哲的一部歷險記，是貝多芬式的一闋大交響樂。（第一册，譯者獻辭）</p>
<p>作者自己說：</p>
<p>我從來沒有寫一部小說的用意：這是顯而易見的。那末這部作品究竟是甚麼呢？一首詩麼？——你們何必要有一個名字呢？——當你們看到一個人時，你們會問他是一部小說或一首詩麼？我所創造的是一個人呀。（第三册，卷七，本卷初版序）所以，我們讀的不是一部小說，而是一個人。我們對到一個天才靈魂的長成，需先經歷多少苦難。</p>
<p>我們看見克利斯朶夫的工作。從小時候，「像所有的兒童一般，他一天到晚哼個不停，」而被祖父將最好的音調記錄下來起，到後來，在經歷了多少勞苦，悲喜，進止的階段之後；終於達到了這一境界：</p>
<p>於是聽任藝術湮沒的克利斯朶夫，篤愕地看到心中湧起無名的威力，爲他所意想不到的：旣不是他的熱情，也不是他的悲哀，也不是他有意識的靈魂……——而是一顆陌生的，對他所愛所苦，對他整個生命全不關心的靈魂，一顆歡樂的，神聖的，擴野的，不可解的靈魂！它把他常飛馬般驅策，用靴尖蹴着他的脅下。常他難得有些’喘息的辰光，便重讀所寫的東西自問道：</p>
<p>——怎麽，怎麼這些從我身上出來？（二〇八八頁）</p>
<p>我們也看到了克利斯朶夫的友誼。從最早的朋友，祖父約翰·米希爾和舅父高脫弗烈特，到晚年的小友，愛麥虞限和喬治，其中有親疏善惡不同關係的許多人物。但最親蜜相互間影響最大的，要算奧里維了。第一次見面後，克利斯朶夫就再三的說着：「我有一個朋友了。」</p>
<p>我有了一個朋友！他和我遠隔天涯，近鄰咫尺，永永在我心頭。我佔有了他，他佔有了我。我的朋友愛我。「愛」把我們兩人底靈魂交融爲一了。（一三四二頁）奧里維死了，克利斯朶夫唯一的念頭是和「他」一起埋葬，一起完結。</p>
<p>塵世的苦難，是一個人幾乎永遠沒有一個伴侶。也許有一些夥伴，有一些偶遇的朋友。朋友這　麗的名詞是被濫用了。實際上一個人一生只能有一個朋友。而這还是很少的人所能享受。但這樁幸福是那樣的美妙，以至一個人一朝把它失掉了時簡直不能再活下去。（一九五九頁）</p>
<p>（二）女性可敬与否作家所见不同</p>
<p>我們也看到了克利斯朶夫的愛情，他的女朋友們，因爲他始終沒有結婚。在這方面，這部書有兩點我覺得相当特殊。其一是書中儘有聖潔的安多納德，恬靜的葛拉齊亞，以及其他的女子，但免沒有一個，是有超人的才華，稱得上克利斯朶夫的。比較起來「紅樓夢」中的女子，就出色得多了。但「紅樓夢」中的男主人公，就顯得那麼可憐：寳玉所缺乏的，正是克利斯朶夫所充沛有餘的——生命力。「紅樓夢」從有到無，「約翰·克利斯朶夫」從无到有；一消極，一積極。</p>
<p>又一特殊之點是：這許多與克利斯朶夫有關的女子中，差不多都沒有幸福的結局。　皮納，安多納德，法朗梭亞士，葛拉齊亞都死了。雖然並不由於克利斯朶夫的過失；但假如她們，尤其是葛拉齊亞，從沒有見過他，則也許她們都要活得久一些，雖然是平淡一些。但，誰知道呢？也許她們情願這樣。生命的充實光輝，不是用生命的長度來量的。這有阿娜，更可憐了。她與克利斯朶夫之間的關係，「那不是愛情，那是精神錯亂」。克利斯朶夫錯亂了，走開，復原了；阿娜錯亂，就此錯亂到底。她的內心生活是怎樣的呢？比較起來，或者還是那些死了的人幸福。我這樣說，並不是批許克利斯朵夫，我是欽佩這書的誠實。</p>
<p>人們往往可以看到，在愛情中間，兩人中較弱的一個是給與最多的人，並非另外一個愛得不够；但因他更强，所以應當取得更多。（二一四一頁）</p>
<p>我們也看到了克利斯朶夫的思想。作者使主人公在德國生長，在法國度送了一截重要的日子，而在意本利終老；他講這個人，同時也講這些國家。所以這書在質上與在量上一般厚重，困爲它不只是一幅肖像畫，而且是一幅</p>
<p>巨大的歷史畫，——不單是寫實的，而且是象徴的，含有預言意味的。作者把整個十九世紀末期的思想史，社會史，政治史，民族史，藝術史來做這個新英雄底背景。（第二册，譯者弁言）</p>
<p>雖然譯者在第二册之首作了弁言，又在全書各處作了無數小註釋，像我這樣的讀者還是要感到這書有許多地方混沌不易了解。但我倒因此願意在三五年後，重讀這書，看對此書的了解，有吾增加，即以此窺測自己有無進步。</p>
<p>（三）難離傳統：本書是基督敎的</p>
<p>但有一點，是我現在好像就明白了的、就是這書究竟是基督教的，照廣義的解釋。在經歷了許多之後。</p>
<p>於是克利斯朶夫懂得了老罕頓底明哲，他每天</p>
<p>早上，在執筆之前，要跪着……「警戒與祈禱」。祈禱上帝，求他和你同在。抱着虔誠與熱愛的心，和生命底精靈溝通。（二〇九〇頁）</p>
<p>在二二八九頁，提到「福音書」裏瑪特蘭納遇到園丁一段。譯者沒有加以註釋，我覺得很可惜，因爲這一段很有意思，而且在四頁後，重又提到這一段，而且還到了一些對話。按那一段是在「新約」「約翰福音」，瑪特蘭納在一般中譯本中稱抹大拉的馬利亞，耶穌曾在她身上趕出七個鬼來。（照我們今日的看法，她應是一位有才氣有鋒芒而精神錯亂的女子，耶穌治好了她的精神錯亂）耶穌復活後，所見的第一個人就是她，她一開始還以爲耶穌是園丁。在本書中，克利斯朶夫得到了葛拉齊亞逝世的消息後，由這一段書得到支特自己的力量。相信復活是迷信麽？羅曼羅蘭却使克利斯來夫相信復活了。</p>
<p>這是部巨著，長闊高深，不可名狀。作者的天才不說，譯者的淵博與辛勞，應得我輩不懂法文而願讀此書的人的感激。</p>
<p>當你見到克利斯朶夫面容之日，是你將死而不死於惡運之日。（古敎堂門前聖者克利斯朶夫像下之拉丁文銘文）</p>
<p>長夜漫漫，終將達且。各國的受苦奮鬥的自由靈魂，終於達到彼岸，迎接黎明與平且。</p>

<h3>從莫扎特一五五週年祭　說到音樂天才測騐</h3>
<p>— 梁酉廷</p>
<p>如果問「悲多芬與莫扎特兩人，誰更偉大些？」這是一個很笨的問題。不過，事實上，一般人是更熟悉於悲多芬，而忽略了絕頂天才的音樂神童莫扎特。</p>
<p>爲什麽說他是神童？因爲他的確在三歲時就開始學習當時的鋼琴（Harpsichord），四歲就可奏三拍子的舞曲而且開始作片斷的曲子，五歲的時候，他當衆表演；所以，他雖然在三十五歲時就短命而亡，但道三十年中，他底生命已完全交付給音樂，他底作品，他底聲音，代表着他底精神而永生。</p>
<p>也許有人懷疑：說四歲作曲，有如神話，恐怕是過分形容。其實，關於莫扎特的史略，在許多史書上可以證明並非妄加彫琢。音樂論壇權威Paul　Bekker做的＂The　Story　of　music”書中，對莫氏的崇拜，也是無以復加。他說：「上下古今音樂神童雖亦不少，但無論在任何方面，莫氏的才能絕非一般音樂神童所可望其項背。」在大英百科全書上，也用着數頁的地位詳述莫氏的生平，對於他每一年的活動，幾乎都有記載。它也說莫氏是四歲就作曲的。（按：西洋習慣的四歲爲四足歲）</p>
<p>凡是藝術，其成功因素，不外乎天才與苦工。像莫扎特底成功，雖應歸功於乃父（當時小提琴名手）的督敎有方，但更主要的還是他底希罕天才。</p>
<p>今天，莫扎特一百五十五週年祭，我們緬懷音樂先哲的「神才」，首先會想到一個目己的問題：中國音樂天才的糟塌，以及音樂敎育的浪費。</p>
<p>必須指出的：人們音樂的「本能天才」，與所受音樂訓練無關。這是近世音樂敎育界試騐的結果。一個幼年音樂學校，用史氏（Sesshore）測騐唱片，來測量一個兒童對於音樂的敏感度，有時可以發現一二個小孩，考試之前並未受過相當的音樂訓練，而考試時對於音階的高低，音量的大小，以及音的强弱等等，可以辨別得很好。同樣理由，如果一個小孩受過嚴格的訓練，但他並沒有天才，那麼他在史氏唱片前，成績仍然拙劣。</p>
<p>所以，中國雖素來音樂水準甚低，音樂敎育亦不普及，但在若十人羣當中，安知沒有像莫扎特那樣的本能的天才？或者近似莫氏的神童？</p>
<p>但是，我們底音樂天才，旣不易被發現，也不會被重視，更遑論去培植。音樂學校中未必盡是天才，而眞正天才常爲父母所誤或爲社會所誤的。進一步說，能够像莫扎特那樣，三歲就受音樂敎育洗禮的，能有幾個？</p>
<p>因此，不少天才被糟塌，也不少不適宜於學做音樂專家的人，被送到專科學校，浪費自己，浪費公衆。</p>
<p>我這樣的說法，並非謂音樂必爲「天才」所專有，而是說：音樂敏感度很低的人，只要以音樂自娛或欣賞人家演奏即可，不必從事於音樂專家的苦練。因爲，那是罔然的。</p>
<p>在美國，史氏測騐唱片，早已到處被使用。曾經有一個十一歲的孩子，被從羣衆中提出來，他家境淸貧，但天才卓越，經則騐後，得到了學習機會。後來在音樂學校畢業時，他得到四種獎學金；二十歲時，他是一個交響樂隊的指揮。還有一個事實：一位六十餘歲的老母親，希望她底女兒成爲鋼琴家，但是她苦苦學習了二千小時的琴，仍無甚成績；經過測騐之後，證明她天才太差。由是她很快樂地，放棄了鋼琴的苦練，而去當一個商店職員了。</p>
<p>美國著名男中音歌唱家勞蘭絲，梯貝脫，也會經被測騐，結果確如意料，他是百分之三的最高一級中的一個。</p>
<p>從紀念音樂神童草扎特，想到音樂天才的培植，又想到中國的音樂敎育，眞不知怎樣講起。</p>
<p>，做父母的，很少會發見兒女的藝術天才，即使發現了，也很少會贊成他們去學習音樂，因爲音樂不會飛黄騰達。但是，一音樂的成就，必須由於從小苦練，而且必須是天才。</p>
<p>國立音樂院幼年班的成立，據說就爲了有應於此；他們也採用史氏唱片的測騐。不過，肯把兒童送到幼年班去終身學習音樂的家長太少了；這是音樂幼年班的致命傷，也是中國音樂的致命傷！</p>
<p>我們沉痛地紀念莫扎特，又沉痛地遙望着我們自己音樂敎育的前路。</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>天巳經黑了，雨還沒有停。一個人在屋子裏躭了半天，實在悶得慌，想找個人談談也不可能，想出去走走也沒去處。看書吧，看了後面忘了前面；意字吧，根本就寫不出來。孤獨和寂寞像賊似的偸偷地到了我的心裏，使我覺得無限的煩惱。</p>
<p>我好像　到她的影子在我的眼前幌着，她說過的話，又在我的耳朵裏饗了起來。眞是見鬼！她的影子爲什麼會像一層薄膜似地貼在我的腦膜上呢？</p>
<p>我不耐煩地站起，在屋角找到了一隻空瓶，拿起雨傘，走出去買了一瓶酒，和一包花生。常我回來把酒倒進玻璃盃的時候，我只想：喝個半成醉就睡覺。誰知道，酒這鬼東西往往控制了人的意志，它像魔鬼似地誘惑着你，使你喝得爛醉。</p>
<p>喝完了酒，我的頭發漲，心發燒，眼白變紅，胸裏蘊藏着無限的愁絲總要吐出才會覺得痛快，否則，就想找個人打一架才能完！</p>
<p>我再也無法控制自己，一切都不管地闖出了大門，淋着雨，無目的地在街道上走着，無力的眼半睜半閉地開着，蹣跚地搖晃着身體，嘴裏呢喃地在說些什麽。她的月亮似的臉，星星似的眼睛，充滿了靑春力和誘感力的身體，總在我面前閃着。她的回眸微笑和輕巧的語聲，老在我的記憶裏跳躍着。這個溫和而又良善的少女，給了我無限的愉快和幸福，同時也帶來了痛苦和煩惱。</p>
<p>我走完了一條街，拐灣再走第二條。雨還在下，行人稀少，汽車簡直沒有，我大胆地在路中搖晃着，雨水從賴子溜進了後背，凉颼颼地很舒服。突然，一輛汽車在我後面「嗞！」地時了起來，司機伸出頭來，駡：「猪玀！儂尋死啊？」</p>
<p>我沒有作聲，只對他輕蔑地一撇嘴，就向路邊走去。但他並一沒有放鬆這駡人的機會。「要尋死去跳黃浦好了！」</p>
<p>我並沒把這放在心上，還是繼續地向前走着。不多久，我就在路口的人行道上站住，靠在一根三角形的電綫桿上。我覺得口渴，想喝水，可是沒有辦法。一輛無軌電車突然在我身邊停下，車裏的燈光照着我，有幾個人從車廂裏下來。我這時才意識到我是站在了那兒。她，微笑着從那邊向我走來，我興奮地迎了上去握她的手，忽然她不見了！我失望地四面看看，惱怒地咀咒了一聲：見鬼！</p>
<p>無軌電車也拐灣而去。</p>
<p>我走進了第三條街，路燈只發出昏黄無力的光，街道還是黑暗的，對面走來的人無法使人看見。我口渴，也開始覺得疲倦了，靠在一顆斜形的樹上休息着，眼睛在慢慢地閉攏來，兩條腿已無力支持整個的體軀；我就擁抱着這棵梧桐使自己站着。這時，我才意識到，我已站在他家對面了。我看見對面樓上的屋裏射出了燈光，我想：也許他們可以給我一杯水渴，不，還不如抬頭懇求上帝吧！我抬起了頭張開了嘴，讓雨水滴進我的嘴裏。一張梧桐葉給水打了下來，我就把它拾一一起，用嘴去吸着上面的雨水，雖一然它的量是那麽少，但它已給了我一還淸涼的感覺。</p>
<p>對面樓屋裏的燈光增亮了，人影在動看。誰又知道這幢規代式的房屋裏，還留着一些封建的餘根呢！她是這家庭的一份子，但她沒有個人行動的自由，一切都得以家庭的意志爲意志，而家庭的代表者是她自己的寡母。</p>
<p>去年聖誕節，她母親用一根繩子拴住了她一條腿？她因此而喝過一次酒，走進了一向所厭惡的跳舞廳，準備忍受上帝所賜予的命運—一條賢妻良母的路程！</p>
<p>我想到了一個朋友對我說的話：天主敎徒是最守舊的，敎規也最嚴，他們決不和非天主敎徒結婚！</p>
<p>我打了一個寒噤！</p>
<p>雨水順着頭髮　到臉上，外衣被淋濕一直浸進了內衣，褲脚貼在腿上並且是那麼沈重。我靠在樹上，樹節刺痛着我，我就轉移到離樹兩步遠的，三角形的水門汀電桿上倚靠着。</p>
<p>往事，夢似地在我腦海裏閃過，她曾被我牽引進這夢，當夢淸醒的時候，什麽都忘懷了。但這不是夢，是一段事實！</p>
<p>夜已經很深了！我呌住了走過的車子，記不淸我是否和他說了什麼。因爲當我淸醒的時候，我已經躺在床上，被和褥都被浸濕，我像從河裏起來一樣地換去了衣服，我覺得頭重得支持不起來，因此我睡了一天。</p>
<p>雖然我有些一恨她，但也因此而使我更懷念她！</p>
<p>雨夜已過去很久了。可是懷戀的情緒還存在着，和雨夜時的一樣。</p>
<h3>習作</h3>
<p>— 辣斐爾</p>
<p>辣斐爾（Raphael　Sanzio　1483—1250）也是意大利文藝復興期的一大巨匠，可惜短命，遺作較少，。其作不像米蓋朗基洛那樣硬性，也沒有文西那樣玄妙，另具一種豐滿，優美的魅力。</p>
<p>（獅）</p>
<h3>音樂神童　莫扎特小傳</h3>
<p>— 洪贊英</p>
<p>德國作曲家莫扎特，向以「音樂神童」著稱，高超的天才和作品中磅礴的氣魄；世無其匹。有人說他是奧國人，其實他是德國南部薩爾滋堡城人，後來遷住維也納；蓋維城爲當時的世界音樂首都，樂人紛集於此。</p>
<p>莫氏生於一七五六年正月廿七日，父親是一個天才的小提琴家，服務於寺院。莫扎特三歲的時候，就和他底姊姊一起學習鋼琴，天炎聰穎，六歲時便隨着父親和姊姊，赴各處作旅行演奏。兩位稚年的姊弟，坐在鋼琴前面，以幼小的兩腕，老練地奏着，聽者無不驚服。</p>
<p>莫氏有一隻最有名的逸話：有一次，他在奧皇前演奏，奏畢竟坐上皇后的兩膝，吻着她的頸，並指着皇女說：「我要娶她。」足見其熱情倜儻，自小已然。</p>
<p>莫氏作品，遍各部門，聲樂，器樂，交響樂，宗敎樂都有精采表現。他的交響樂與悲多芬齊名，有的人或認爲莫氏作品不易被接受，其實他的作品中最富於革命的情緒。Paul　Bekker說他是「爲求自由而以生命爲賭注的第一個人。他的人格思想都表現於作品中。」</p>
<p>我以爲：「曲高和寡」，在所難免，而且，這並沒有影響到莫氏作品在音樂史上的永久價値</p>
<p>貧窮，失戀，一直磨難着莫扎特，在昔樂的貢獻方面言，他是成功的，他奉獻了所有的生命，但在他個人言，則於六哉以後即到處奔波，結果享年僅三十五，即因塲寒不治，而了結一生。他於一七九一年十二月五日（即一百五十五年前的今日），在舉世）痛悼中魂歸天國。</p>
<p>願莫扎特在天國中，能意識到我們對他的遙祭！</p>
<h3>海上逢大千居士喜贈一詩</h3>
<p>— 周心</p>
<p>十年前作吳門別，此日相逢海上來。腕底更多新岫　。眼中寗有舊池台；王孫高躅原同調，（心畬頃亦蒞滬）弟子從游亦異才；（余盛明新籍門下）乞我黄山樓一角，遲能爲補劫餘灰。（君曾爲予畫黄山圖，並撰長跋記之，戰時熀於盜火，懊憾至今。）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　113</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>然而轉念一想，又覺不對，萍子縱然頑皮，也不能惡作劇到之地步，之張小紙上面，定有重要消息，或關系我個人的秘密，想到這裏，便又把那小紙，重新好好藏了起來。剛剛吸了兩口烟，猛然心思一動，立刻又把記事册上的白頁，扯了一張下來，四面看了一看，見壁上的一張條屛上，寫得一手的好米南宮，字句却是李後主的小詞「春花秋月何時了，往事知多少……」便把自己筆跡一變，信手用那校活動鉛筆，在那張白頁上寫着，「春花秋月等閒度，往事多少君自知」。</p>
<p>鶴見這裏剛剛寫好折好，猛然聽得門外，傳來一陣輕微的步聲，便迅疾地把寫好的字片，依樣藏在烟匣裏，又將烟匣放入袋內，記事册鉛筆等，也依舊收藏起來。就在這時候，聽得門上輕輕敲了兩下，不等裏面答應，門已開了。</p>
<p>鶴見轉頭天看，只見進來的，並不是那位獨眼紳士，乃是一個西服的日本人，舉止沉着而又靈敏。走進室內，冲着鶴見不卑不沆，行了一個半鞠躬禮：</p>
<p>「鶴見君嗎？……相爺請見』。　鶴見起身迎着，依樣還了一禮，舉步待走；只見那人伸開兩手，虛虛一　：「對不起」，說着又來一個半鞠躬姿勢，「這裏還有一點關節手續，凡是生客進見，鄙人負有責任……眞正失禮得很……失禮得很」：他擋住了去路。</p>
<p>鶴見明瞭他的意思，知道他要搜査一下，便很漂亮地把幾個口袋裏的東西，都搯了出來，放在中央的圓桌上，然後走過去，請那人檢抄身上。那人看了鶴見一眼，便說身上無須檢視，只是要很失禮的把桌上的物件留下兩樣」，只見他走過去，先把那支活動鉛筆拿起來，現出日本人那種見神見鬼的模樣，看了又看，敲了又敲，敲畢放在一邊，第二件就是那隻精緻的烟匣，也表演了一套審視手續；發見了那張折着的小紙，看了一眼，又依原樣放好。幸虧這個日本人，大槪血統不是百分之百的純粹，動作上就沒有那「純種」的滯鈍，瑣碎，拙笨，而又遲疑。</p>
<p>「乎續完了……只是　用的　校着的筆，和這隻烟匣，暫時得由鄙人保管一下，失禮得很」。</p>
<p>鶴見這才由那人帶着，穿過廣廳，彎彎曲曲，走過兩條甬道。這裏一切建築設計和式樣。都是完全歐化。到了甬道盡頭，那人上前把盡頭的小門輕輕開了，又來一個半鞠躬式，伸手邀着，請鶴見進去，當那小門乍開，鶴見就聽得一陣可可咚咚，幽韻的琴聲，又似三弦，又似中國的七弦古琴。</p>
<p>鶴見一跨進那門，頓時覺得景物一變，一切都是古香古色，回後到了「八紘一宇」的純粹日本風味；擘面就是一座屛風，倒是十分雅緻的本土藝術產品；，屛風後面，是一排四扇格子門，門與屛風之中，上面懸着四盞氣死風燈，外面雖是日本式子，裏面却是電燈，鶴見剛一跨進門，屏風後面早轉出兩個濃妝艷抹，十分妖嬈的女人，又像走出來，又像是爬出來的；也可說是一路傴僂鞠躬着，鑽出來的。兩個女人，雖然不敢高聲說話，嘴裏兀自念念有詞；又是「晚安」，又是「辛苦」嘿嘿　　一大串。離開鶴見還有兩步遠近，兩個女人，索性一齊跪了下去，此起彼落地，不住叩頭。叩頭未畢，二人正式爬了過來，一邊一個，猛向鶴見的兩腿搶了過來，替鶴見把一雙皮鞋脫去。</p>

<h3>存款</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>戰前存款償付問題，一再引起糾紛而涉訟法庭，這個問題如果當局不趕快議定一處置辦法，則今後將層出不窮，令法院，銀行與存戶都受累不堪，而無法應付。</p>
<p>我就曾親眼看到一個中年婦人在上海銀行大哭大鬧了半大，爲了要求銀行照兩千倍償付她的戰前存款，自然，這一塲哭鬧是沒有結果的，可是當時那一傷面，在塲者（即使銀行裏的職員）又有哪一個不同情那位中年婦人呢？</p>
<p>這種糾紛，上海的地方法院曾經判決過一宗，其判決爲照存款到期本利所得一千倍償付。這是勝利以來令國存款償付糾紛的第一個判例，將來或許可供財政當局或行政當局議定處置辦法時的參考。</p>
<p>將來議定處置辦法時，我們認爲須求一個折衷持平，一方面使存戶不要損失太大，一方面也應顧到銀行的負担，總之，兩方面都要喫一點虧。</p>
<p>貨幣貶値，影響到一切，這是戰爭中無可避免的損害，我們也不能從戰敗的侵略國的賠償賬內劃出來支付，但我們可以退一步想，假使這筆存款在戰爭中投失掉了呢？千千萬萬人不是傾家蕩產了嗎？至於銀行方面，也不妨多爲存戶利益着想一些，就是稍稍增加一點負担，也祇好忍痛犧牲了。</p>
<h3>假如我開間殯儀館</h3>
<p>— 瀧之谷</p>
<p>上海人做生意最乖巧，不祇「陸槁薦」「王麻子」之類照樣借用，而且中國製造的本地貨，也全身洋文裝備，勉强一點有個中文名，也不過是譯自洋文而已。更省事省時的還有直接挪借洋貨商標，比方美國有狗頭牌香烟，英國有貓頭牌洋酒，賣得響，上海準會有狗頭貓頭的肥皂手帕之類。</p>
<p>筆者援例作如下之設計書：</p>
<p>（一）假如我開一間殯儀館，我必借用著名之手錶牌子「奧美茄」爲館名。因爲「奧美茄」即希臘文最後一個字母「　」，意義爲「最後」，「完蛋」，「死亡」。</p>
<p>（二）假如我興建一條私有鐵路，其路徽必借用美國名烟的「駱駝」，以示行車速率較國有鐵道猶速。</p>
<p>（三）假如我開一間鮮花店，我想採用Forget－me－not「毋忘我」花爲商標，每一瓣花片中心的花脈，特別加重！！！（唉！唉!唉！）三個英文字母，以爲單戀者失戀者吐一口氣。</p>
<p>（四），美國聽說有些大規模的薦人館，專門供給罷工工廠老闆以臨時雇工。假如我也弄這麼一Lucky　Strike）的商標，因直譯可作爲「幸運的罷工」也！</p>
<p>（五），我假如開一間薦人館專門供給童工於各大廠商，那我將毫不遲疑的借用美國「克寗」奶粉的名字，因爲「克寗」即KLIM乃「牛乳」MILK之倒寫，而竊意該童工介紹所未嘗不可以名爲「乳牛」也。</p>
<p>（六）說完了生意經，假如我也凑凑熱鬧，弄個所謂「政黨」，那末，瑞士的手錶牌子「暮嘩度」（Movado）正好作爲「黨」諸「愛斯不難讀」文（即「世界語」）爲「活動活動，繼續活動」也。</p>
<p>（七）還是再談買賣好。假如我開一家帽店，專門供給蓄意鑽營的諸色人等，那末，美國著名的活動鉛筆Eversharp（「永尖」）牌，豈非十分現成？</p>
<p>（八）有人問我假如你經營一間印鈔公司將起一個什麽洋味兒的店名。答曰：借美國現成的手電筒牌子「Eveready」，「永備」，永備也。</p>
<p>（九）說句岔話。若然有人經營一間女子公寓雖許可男人進出，但禁止如此這般瞎鬧的呢，那末一個現成的美國女性專用的商品名字，曰：「Kotex」看起來豈不像「Hotel」嗎？如何?</p>
<p>（十）但我始終想不出適當的用途，好來借用這個商標：給，一根繩子縛着的一個啄木鳥。那是歐洲著名的家庭用藥，給不想養孩子的爸爸媽媽用的。</p>
<p>以上所說，一律版權所有，未得「自由談」允許，不許實地使用。OIC，知道了。（末後這三個洋文字母。用作眼鏡店商標，正好。正好。）</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織　7</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>開汽車門</p>
<p>上海汽車之爲全國冠。當汽車在街頭停車或將啓行的時候也就造成了一個佈施的機會。這一霎那，老弟兄丐帮是不肯輕易錯過的；因爲這又是本地小鬼們一個扒錢新路。那些乘汽車的不外是闊老和闊太太們，丐流們眼明手快地去替他們開關汽車門，一舉手之勞，在戰前所得非元即角，在現在却非幾百元不可。在汽車進出較多的塲合，一小時內就有很優厚的收入。於是踵相效允，帮中弟兄覦爲利蔽，趨之若騖。目前全市就有一千多人專營此業了。他們活動的地點，不外是各大酒樓，旅館，戲院，跳舞塲的門前及其附近。還有的是書萬薈聚的弄堂口，以及銀行公寓等處。他們佇候着，一遇見汽車停靠，便跑過去開汽車門，等到闊老們下車後，連忙　的一聲，把車門關上了，於是師出有名，可以向闊老們要錢了。他們口中還說出善頌善　的話。如果不給錢的話，他們立刻便以不利的惡聲相報。因爲等到闊老一進大門，便失去了扒錢的機會。不急急地呌屬是會錯過機會的。闊老們得到了過去挨駡的經騐，知道不給是不漂亮的，故都情願急急地翰資遣散。可是富人們身上時常沒有零錢，一摸祇有一千二千的票子。沒有辦法時也祇好忍痛給付。這都是丐流們的運來時來。無怪他們樂此不疲了。</p>
<p>有時汽車夫因事離車，他們還可以代任守護之戰。若是逢到車主自己開車的，丐流便毛遂自　地充任守衛。其實此輩並沒有守衛的能力與把握，却祇有領賞的本領。等到車主回來時，他們又都振振有詞地自誇勞績起來了。</p>
<p>爲了開汽車門進益優厚，而地段肥吾有別。帮中爺叔輩不得不將地盤劃分淸楚，一方面避免同帮爭奪，一方面又可以分配地據，拒絕外行無賴的覬綫。而出動拉汽車門的却祇限於小鬼和老弱弟兄，因老幼丐流比較容易得到佈施，少壯丐流却全部被屛棄了。</p>
<p>喪喜事賞資</p>
<p>中國各地的乞丐，和民間接觸向來密切。尤其是逢到舉行婚喪壽喜禮節的時候，總免不了叨惠乞丐的光臨打擾的。這風俗自古以來盛行着的。在上海，老弟兄丐帮因爲得地利人和之先，這份優美差事向來視爲禁臠，是不容許他帮丐帮來染指的。</p>
<p>上海住戶的富力遠勝於內地者，而習俗又喜面子，各地段爺叔班子平日閒來無事，專門在打聽轄境內的婚喪事。他們眞是神通廣大，通訊網無遠弗佈。丐流終日徘徊於街巷中，一得訊便立刻飛報爺叔輩，一傳十，十傳百，再由爺叔呈報丐頭，屆時便率領羣丐，前往喪喜事人家要錢。其要錢的方式紅白有別，請分述之：</p>
<h3>當火患發生的時候</h3>
<p>— 懋哉譯自讀者文摘</p>
<p>（編者按：這是一篇六月份「讀者文摘」中的文章，論時間已不新鮮，但爲了天寒物燥，當局正宣傳防火，似乎仍有介紹給讀者的必要。）</p>
<p>消防人員總說，一座最完善的屋宇，也將是最容易從內裏跑到屋外來的一幢。我們同樣地可銳，一位最佳的屋主人，是他知道，在火患的時候，怎樣最迅速的趨避到屋外。</p>
<p>您以爲這是平凡的，很簡單的嗎？那末在美國西部城市裏，有兩個十多歲的孩子，當火患發生的時候，他們儘有機曾從他倆寢室跨到陽台上，再踏上屋面，安全地跳落到下面的花園裏；然而，他倆却是死在三樓寢室的門口；原因無他，他倆，只是像普通人一樣，在發現火患後，極端的驚惶裏，直趨向扶梯處去—永遠不能完成的一個舉動。</p>
<p>樓下著火</p>
<p>四分之三的火災枉死，都是由於樓下著火，熱烟土升，而窒息致斃於樓上的；當下面火燒時，薰烟，可燃性氣體，溫度高至八百度或一千度，迅速地彌漫於屋宇的上部；試想，從夢中驚醒，迷惘，惶遽，旗衝向臥室外，樓梯處去，能不中途倒地嗎？最可憐的是，他們這些犧牲者，遠在火焰達到身上以前，早已停止了他們的呼吸，他們儘有機會趨避呀？</p>
<p>進一步的思慮，訓練，委實可拯救千萬數的枉死。您驚醒，聞到極濃厚的烟味，記住，千禽勿躍起開門。您當舉起您的手掌，按在頭部以上的門扇上，倘是一木板已薰得灼熱的話，千萬別開門；灼熱的木板或門球，足徵臥室以外的空間，已是充滿了窒息死命的烟熖，趨向樓梯處，已是不可能的呀，</p>
<p>您應該，讓門繼續閉著，而設法從窗口出去，或是在窗口呼救；有門擋住這一般熟流，您可以等待救星到來，您有更多的機會得救。</p>
<p>假定，你發覺門扇並不灼熟的話，你亦應謹慎的開啓；用您的足，臀部，緊緊的頂住了門，隨時隨地，準備關閉，一隻手，舉起，按在頭頂的門縫上，稍爲拉開一二吋，試試有無壓力，或者熱汽冲入，有，迅即關閉，另向窗口謀出路。</p>
<p>關門技術</p>
<p>其次，我們再談關門的技術；常常，我人發覺火患發生時，倉皇失態，慌急在亂的衝出門去，讓這門大開著；要知道，燃燒之室的門的大打開的結果，將使濃積的烟熖，熱汽，縱横捭闔，直趨向整個屋宇的各部，而加速其完結呀！我人絕對應該，，當機的將這門關閉，讓火熖，熟烟，禁閉在一室內，就這數分鐘的延擱，整個房屋，或有保全的希望。</p>
<p>且叙述一件事實。一位年輕的妻子，在廚裏，想用一些洋油，引著煤氣，不幸地，煤氣爆炸的結果，使整個廚房充滿了火熖；牠不知所措，當驚魂初定，第一個思想竄進她腦子的，是睡在樓上的嬰孩，她轉過身來，飛步上樓，搶了小孩，回身下溪。</p>
<p>同時隣居也發覺了，立即打電話給近在一哩以內的救火會，救火會迅即來到，但是，他們到來的時候，已發覺這一對可憐的母子倆，倒斃在樓上。</p>
<p>她的臉上，現著爲烟焰扼死時的苦痛，無疑的，他兩是爲上升的濃煙烈焰所殺死的—唯一的原因，是牠未曾將燒著的廚房之門帶上。</p>
<p>消防人員承認，千萬的枉死者，倘能明瞭，記住，實行這二條簡單的規則—開門與關門，他們將因此得救，他們將仍是快樂的，幸福的生活著</p>
<p>記住，您—我的朋友！</p>
<h3>談水上屋</h3>
<p>— 紅雨</p>
<p>報載有人提議：陸地屋子可以推擴到水上去。在實際水上做家的，除了閩省另外一種民族「蜓戶」外，廣西的蒼梧，在桂江和潯江交流的地方，因爲陸地面積狹小，便在水上結「　」而居的人家，達三分之一。按　的構造，下以木船横排，上面架着木板造成平屋或樓房，也有美輪美奐的建築，使人望而生羨的。就說上海罷），戰前在北京路外灘沿黄浦，不是也有一所水上飯店嗎？文飾華美，居然有樓有臺，裏面備着高貴的西餐和冷飲，專門供給一般富紳大賈，在那兒悠閒地消夏的。淪陷時候，敵人把牠當作憲兵駐所，就中不知道搬演了幾許慘劇！如今這所水上飯店，外廓猶是，內部全非，所以也並未修復，公開供給市民使用。其他像沿蘇州河一帶，許多貧民都在岸旁河邊，蓋了不少連營寨式的茅屋，屋基却把木樁釘在水裏。那些住戶，旣母須納房捐和地稅，很悠閒的在裏邊兒哼着。「三枝花兒開，又開又開」的淸歌呢。據此，水上造屋，的確大有可能。但是要靠牠解決房荒，似乎是不可能的。因爲房荒的　結所在，不是眞的房子沒有，而在大黄魚小黄魚的缺乏。今有人設此空想，要在水上拓展地盤，其實也正在計算旣屬近水，撈魚自易。但是須注意的，黄浦江雖有黄字頭的帽子，下邊兒却缺着一個「金」字。同時黄魚也並不出在浦江，而必須出海去撈的。明乎此，才可知道閘北南市，空地正多，實在不必「吊而郞當」在水上作空想的。</p>

<h3>禁</h3>
<p>— 裕瑗</p>
<p>假使高利貸有一天因爲最嚴厲的禁令而全部消滅的話，我的預測是：一，吃高利貸飯的人失業；二，游資搶黄金；三，商店有十分之二以上立刻宣吿倒閑；四，華股狂跌到沒有人敢買。</p>
<h3>壓</h3>
<p>— 裕</p>
<p>南京上海在淘汰人力車，內地城市在淘汰獨輪車；這淘汰的意思就是向下壓一級的意思。人力車到內地城裏去，獨輪車到鄕村裏去。</p>
<h3>淚</h3>
<p>— 陳德馨</p>
<p>「燭淚落時民淚落，歌聲高處怨聲高！」請享福受用，畫夜逍遙的先生女士，多多玩味！多多行善！載舟覆舟，愼之愼之！</p>
<h3>冷</h3>
<p>— 鶴松</p>
<p>大家都說今年天氣冷，但我以爲除天氣的因素以外，更重要的應是大家身上的衣服都比往年少了。</p>
<h3>凍</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>近來常有人凍死，而且，大半都是孩童。</p>
<p>我還記得，在不多幾天以前，曾經有些少年們列隊向市政府等機關表示感謝。因爲他們原是流落在街頭的一　，而現在却「不怕飢凍」了。市長在答辭裏說，養撫流落是政府的責任。</p>
<p>我聽見更多的人向政府表示感謝！</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>記莫德惠先生</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>近日紛紛傳說政府即將改組，關於行政院長一席，更成爲各方面揣測議論的中心。幾日前，傳言以爲張羣和孫科呼聲最高，最近忽傳聞莫德惠頗有希望。關於張，孫兩氏，本刋前此已有記載，現在，讓我談談這位莫老先生。</p>
<p>莫先生今年六十四歲，字柳忱，原籍吉林雙城縣，在北洋高等巡　學堂正科畢業後，即在哈爾濱市警界服務，曾任哈市巡警局長，吉林省雙城，楡樹，濱江等縣知事，民國十一年曾任東三省保安司令部諮議，十五年曾出任代理奉天省長。張作霖在皇姑屯車站遇炸斃命時，莫氏適在附近，也受有輕傷。</p>
<p>民國十九年，他就任東北政務委員會委員，中東鐵路理事長兼督辦等職；同年五月，奉派赴蘇俄爲我國出席中蘇會議全種代表，他和俄國官塲，有過折衝樽俎的經騐。民國元年，曾由俄皇授給莫氏以斯托呢斯拉夫三等勳章。</p>
<p>莫氏一生的行爲，可以「秉性剛正，居心仁厚」八字包括，他不喜受人恭維，相反地，友人能够率直指責他的過失，莫氏必定大感快慰，隨即改過。</p>
<p>他有一個時期，會息影故里獨居，以在野之身。致力於地方自治以及敎育等事宜，所以在今日的東北，莫氏依舊是「衆望所歸」的一位人物。</p>
<p>勝利以後，東北不能順利收復，繼而燃起漫天烽火，莫氏遙望故鄕，有家不得歸，痛心國事，曾當衆流涕痛哭，成了一個善哭的老人。</p>
<p>莫德惠先生，過去曾有優異的政聲，今日以無黨無派的超然立塲，未嘗不是出任中樞要位適當人選。</p>
<h3>誰是兇手？</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>流星般的一霎那之間，顯赫一時的大亨，沙利文，突然被人打死了，滿身槍彈的倒在國家農塲之前的階沿石上。</p>
<p>他是一個殘忍的殺人者，不僅是那些被他手下的徒弟們所敲詐着的商店老闆們都懼怕他，他自己手下的徒弟們也懼怕他。他的驕恣和自私同他的權勢一樣的增加着，但是，當他不願與人平均的分贓，而想獨肥的時候，就被人打死了。</p>
<p>在未審間之前，霍達耐敎授曉得他有八個徒弟計劃着想「送他終」。他們的名字是呌（一）白謀，（二）馬二，（三）李金，（四）吳特，（五）葉九，（六）許新，（七）喬生，（八）鮑得興——那些都是徒弟中最厲害的人——其中的一個，殺死了他老頭子沙利文的。</p>
<p>經過幾次很危險的偵査，霍達耐敎授知道了那下列的幾個事實。</p>
<p>（一）白謀，李金，和那殺人者是最不滿意沙利文的人。</p>
<p>（二）在八個人之中，有一個是沙利文的私人保鑣（私人護衛者），並且是非常秘密的，祇有葉九和喬生知道他是誰。</p>
<p>（三）在殺人的前一天，許新，鮑得興，白謀和那私人保鑣在賭塲中輸掉很多的錢。</p>
<p>（四）一星期以前，馬二，葉九和那殺人的兇手一同要求沙利文公開平均地分贓，遭拒絕之後，吳特和那殺人者勸誘私人保鏢去『做掉他』，但是沒有成功。</p>
<p>（五）在這次對沙利文的反動中，領導的人是許新，鮑得興，和那殺人者。</p>
<p>八個人都已經拘捕來了，他們旣然拒絕吐露實言，霍達耐敎授，根據上列的五條事實，指認出來了誰是私人保鑣，誰是殺人者。</p>
<p>誰呀？誰是那私人保鑣？誰是那殺人的兇手？　（譯自Pockor　Ententainer）</p>
<p>答案明日分曉</p>

<h3>Harmonious Atmosphere at the National Assembly, Various Parties and Factions Expressed Opinions, and Mourned Together for Female Representative Liu Chunyi</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The National Assembly Chairman presided over the meeting at 6:00 PM on the 4th, chaired by Huang Yun, and decided to continue the ninth session of the Assembly at 10:00 AM on the 5th, chaired by Zhang Ji. Whether to continue the Assembly in the afternoon would be decided after the morning session. Another report: As of the 4th, the list of members of the various review committees and the comprehensive review committee had not yet been submitted to the Presidium.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The People's Congress held its eighth meeting on the 4th. The meeting was called to order at 9:35 AM with the ringing of a bell. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Hechang reported that 1,103 representatives were present. Chairman Hu Shuhua led the assembly in performing the customary salutations and announced that female representative Liu Chunyi had passed away in the morning at the Central Hospital due to cerebral hemorrhage. The entire assembly stood up to pay their respects. Then, they began to broadly exchange opinions on the draft constitution. Xinjiang representative Zhang Fengji first stated that another representative from Xinjiang, Abulahat Mahsut, had not had the opportunity to speak the previous day and requested that he be given priority. This was unanimously agreed upon by the assembly. Mr. Abulahat then delivered his speech in Uyghur, which was translated by representative Mai Huanxin.

<h3>Youth Party Speaks for the First Time, Supporting National Supremacy and Endorsing a Strong and Powerful Government</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] During the morning session of the eighth National Assembly, the representatives expressed their opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Abulahat Mahsut, representative of the Xinjiang region: Every revolution in the world has a primary goal and slogan. Mr. Sun Yat-sen proposed the lofty principle of equality among all ethnic groups in the country. However, 35 years since the establishment of the Republic of China, this has not been realized in practice. Border regions, with Xinjiang being the bridge between Europe and Asia, are particularly important. All ethnic groups in Xinjiang are members of the Chinese nation. Why is there such inequality? It is hoped that the National Assembly and the government will jointly take responsibility for this issue and seek a thorough solution in the constitution.</p>
<p>Qumu Changmin, representative of the Xikang region: Most of the indigenous ethnic compatriots in various provinces and regions have been sinicized. However, their lives are controlled by the local gentry and officials, and they have no political status. It is requested that the assembly pay attention to this and incorporate provisions into the constitution to raise the status of ethnic minorities and increase their welfare.</p>
<p>Shi Shangkuan, elected representative: (1) The characteristic of the Five-Power Constitution is to extract the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of the parliamentary system and the presidential system. The National Assembly, representing the people, exercises strong political power, while the five Yuans exercise governing power in conjunction with the government, enabling it to amend the governing power institutions for the strongest political power, which should be rectified. (2) The word "responsible" in Article 58, which states that the Executive Yuan is "responsible" to the Legislative Yuan, is incorrect. The relationship between the Yuans should be one of equal partnership. Disputes between the Executive and Legislative Yuans should be judged by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>He Luzhi, elected representative (Youth Party): The majority opinion in the assembly is that mutual checks and balances among governing power institutions will offset administrative power, which is quite reasonable. Although we participated in the revision of the draft constitution, its content does not fully reflect the proposals of the Youth Party. We have always believed that national interests are above all else. For the sake of the future of the nation and the country, we will never be rigid and insist on our own opinions. We also agree with the establishment of a strong and powerful government to cope with the current situation. It is hoped that the assembly and the various review committees will conduct thorough discussions and formulate a constitution that is most perfect, most reasonable, and most suitable for the national conditions. We will also follow in the footsteps of all the representatives and work hard for the future nation-building cause.</p>
<p>Yu Jiaju, elected representative: We (Youth Party) are a minority party, and our role is to provide both positive and negative opinions. Now, we only express the following opinions: (1) The public opinion organs should be permanent, hold meetings regularly, and the number of people should not be too large. It should be parallel with the administrative organs. The functions of the Legislative Yuan in the amendment meet these conditions. It only rejects laws and policies of the Executive Yuan, but does not vote on a vote of no confidence, which also meets the national conditions. (2) The rights of the president should not be too large or too small, so that he can be capable but not have exclusive power. (3) The autonomous system should be used in an appropriate way to maintain unity. "Autonomy" cannot be used to implement "division," nor can "unity" be used to implement "oppression." (4) Professional and women's groups should have spokespersons in the public opinion organs.</p>
<p>Wang Shizeng, elected representative: The people control the government with political power in three ways: personnel control, political control, and legislative control. The amendment and the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft have the same starting point on this, but the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft gives them all to the National Assembly, while the amendment divides them between the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan. We admit that Sun Yat-sen's political ideals are the most outstanding in common usage, but the conditions for their realization must wait until all parts of the country have reached the constitutional period. The current situation has not yet reached that time. It is advocated that the power of the National Assembly maintain the provisions of Chapter 3, Article 27. Hu Dingan, a representative of the liberal professions: (1) If you want a strong country, you must first strengthen the race. The physical fitness level of the people must be improved. It is advocated that the people's rights to health care, rest, and hygiene be included in the constitution. (2) The number of liberal professions in the professional group representatives should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Zhan Xuehai, representative of the Hubei region: (1) Division of power and ability; (2) Political power should be separated from governing power and be independent; (3) The National Assembly can set up a smaller permanent organization during the adjournment period to administer power to avoid the Legislative Yuan's excessive power, where the governing power plunders the political power.</p>
<p>Tang Guozhen, an elected female representative: (1) The location of the capital is not clearly stated in the constitution; (2) The election of ethnic minorities in the border areas and professional and women's groups should be listed after Article 129 to eliminate de facto inequality.</p>
<p>Kong Geng, representative of the Hubei region: The representatives of the Youth Party have already expressed their opinions. Please invite Mr. Yao Dongyou from the Democratic Socialist Party to speak.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhongyue, representative of the Yunnan region: (1) The amendment collects the various opinions since the Fifth-Fifth Draft, which is generally good; (2) The Legislative Yuan's excessive power should be amended.</p>
<p>Wang Huaiming, representative of the Shanxi region: Article 90 should not be limited to civil servants for the examination, but should include candidates for public office. The term "regional quota" is not clearly defined, and the method is not thorough. It should be changed to "regional examination, provincial quota."</p>
<p>Li Hongwen, representative of the Shanxi region: (1) Changes to the territory in Article 4 must be approved by the National Assembly; (2) Chapter 4 on the powers of the National Assembly should be revised and added; (3) The establishment of the capital should be considered from the perspective of national security and ethnic interests, and there should be no regional self-interest. It is advocated to establish the capital in Beiping, because: (1) Geographically and historically, Beiping has been a famous capital since ancient times. Those who have established their capital in Beiping can continue to rule; (2) In terms of national defense, it can control the Northeast and Northwest; (3) Economically, heavy industrial raw materials are all in the North. To build the country, we must make every effort to develop it. It is easy to do it near Beiping; (4) In terms of transportation, land and water are very convenient; (5) In terms of climate, Beiping summers do not delay work.</p>
<p>Yuan Baohuang, Tianjin professional representative: The number of workers' representatives in the country should be stipulated in the professional group elections.</p>
<p>Wu Yanhuan, representative of the Hebei region: (1) "Mr. Sun Yat-sen" in the preface to the draft constitution should be respectfully referred to as the "Father of the Nation"; (2) The proposition to establish the capital in Beiping is based on the perspective of national defense security, and it is by no means selfish. It is hoped that all parties will not lightly make idle remarks.</p>
<p>Li Wanjuz, representative of the Taiwan region: (1) Article 14 should be changed to "The people have the freedom of belief in doctrines and religions to avoid confusion; (2) The power of the National Assembly is too small; (3) Local rights should be more clearly stipulated; (4) More than 95% of the people in Taiwan have received education and are highly educated. Can autonomy be granted during the implementation of the constitution?</p>
<h3>Zhang Lan to Arrive in Shanghai Within a Week</h3>
<p>The Democratic League is About to Convene a Central Standing Committee Meeting</p>

<p>[Our Beijing Correspondent, 4th] Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui, who opposed the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly, recently received a telegram from Zhang Junmai urging them to fly to Shanghai to discuss the issue of party unity. It is reported that the three are preparing to go.</p>
<h3>National Defense Council Routine Meeting Changed to Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The routine meeting of the Supreme National Defense Committee, which was originally scheduled to be held on the 4th, was not convened. It is reported that it has been rescheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 6th.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives Save Refreshment Fees, Donate Funds to Aid Nanjing Refugees, Presidium Decides to Give Each Representative a Special Allowance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Some representatives of the National Assembly, concerned about the refugees in Nanjing, have repeatedly proposed to save the refreshment fees of the Assembly and use them for aid, and to ask the representatives to donate funds for aid. It is now learned that this case has been resolved by the Presidium meeting. According to the wishes of the representatives, the Assembly will stop providing refreshments from the 4th, and the fees will be used for aid. The government will also be requested to order the competent authorities to promptly distribute relief to the refugees. As for donating funds for aid, each representative will voluntarily donate, and the representatives will transfer the donations to the post office bureau in the assembly hall. It is reported that the bureau received 1 million yuan in donations in one day on the 4th. The donors included Wang Tongye, Li Yingsheng, Huyan Liren, Chen Xingsun, Hu Yiming, Xue Dubi, Xue Shixuan, Zhu Shuchi, Liao Gongpu, Chen Jingchuan, Liu Houwu, Ding Zhongying, Wan Zhucun, Zhou Zhaolin, Wang Mingxuan, etc. There were also two representatives who donated 310,000 yuan anonymously. In addition, Tao Wan, a staff member of the bureau, also voluntarily donated 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Presidium of the National Assembly believes that the prices in Nanjing are high, and the food and accommodation expenses received by the representatives are not enough to cover their expenses. It was specially proposed for discussion at the tenth meeting of the Presidium, and it was decided that each representative would be given a special allowance of 500,000 yuan by the Assembly, and the government would be requested to order the Ministry of Finance to urgently pay the money, which can be distributed to the representatives within a few days.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Representatives Speak Successively, Explaining the Spirit of the Political Consultative Conference Draft Constitution, Hoping to Formulate a National Centennial Law</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The main points of the speeches of the representatives at the eighth National Assembly in the afternoon are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Chuanlin: The draft constitution is generally very good, but we should now formulate a centennial plan that is needed by the people of the whole country, and everyone should discuss it calmly. I also hope that this draft constitution can be passed at the meeting, but Article 7 "Establish the capital in Nanjing" should be deleted, because no country has put the establishment of the capital in the constitution. At the same time, if the country encounters an accident, the capital must be moved, and the parliament will not be able to convene, so the location cannot be determined. Regarding the location of the capital, I think it should be in Beiping now, but Beiping will not be a good place in the future. My country's exchanges with foreign countries are not in the southeast but in the northwest, so the capital should be built in Lanzhou, for the following reasons: (1) It may consolidate the national defense in the northwest; (2) The northwest is sparsely populated, and the southeast is densely populated. If the capital is built in the northwest, the people in the southeast can immigrate to the northwest to achieve the purpose of development; (3) The culture of the northwest is backward. If the capital is built in the northwest, the phenomenon of abnormal development of culture in the southeast can be eliminated, and the national culture can be developed universally and evenly. This point will be discussed again at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to propose that in Article 137 of Chapter 13, "The foreign policy of the Republic of China shall be based on the spirit of independence and autonomy, so as to promote good neighborliness, fulfill treaty obligations, abide by the Charter of the United Nations, promote international cooperation, and ensure world peace as the basic policy." The seven words "abide by the Charter of the United Nations" should be deleted, because the Charter of the United Nations is temporary, and my country's charter is permanent.</p>
<h3>Reduce Party Color, Take into Account Environmental Needs</h3>
<p>Jiang Yuntian: The draft constitution submitted by Chairman Chiang to the Assembly this time is mostly the result of consultations among representatives of various parties and social elites across the country. Our party has participated in the consultation and cannot but respect the opinions of the consultation in terms of morality, but this draft constitution is a collection of opinions from all parties. From a theoretical point of view, some articles have a considerable distance from the ideals of our party.</p>
<p>Our Democratic Socialist Party believes that since we are formulating a centennial law for the country and establishing common rules for the people of the whole country, the first is to reduce the color of the party, and the second is to take into account the current actual environmental needs. Reducing the color of the party can permeate opinions from all parties. The more opinions it permeates, the more it will be supported by the majority. Being able to take into account the needs of the actual environment, the use can be flexible, and many difficulties can be reduced when implementing it. This draft constitution was written under these two major premises.</p>
<p>In terms of reducing party color: Article 1 is an example, which has permeated the opinions of all parties and included all the people of the country. In terms of taking into account the needs of the environment, Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 together show its characteristics. For example, the National Assembly can elect a wise and outstanding president. The provisions in the draft constitution allow him to exert his outstanding talents to lead the nation-building cause without forcing him to have behaviors that exceed the constitution. If the National Assembly cannot elect a first-class president, and the Legislative Yuan can agree to an intelligent and capable president of the Executive Yuan, then the president of the Executive Yuan can also exert his talents in this draft constitution and replace most of the president to lead the nation-building cause. Hearing the opinions of the representatives in recent days, I think that the powers of the National Assembly are too small. From the perspective of quantity, there are only elections or recall of the president and amendment of the constitution, which seems too little. However, from the importance of exercising power, its powers are great and sacred. If every representative of the National Assembly can elect a president for the country, then his contribution to the country will be very great. As for amending the constitution, it is the most basic and important power. Therefore, we believe that the power of the National Assembly is not less than that of the Legislative Yuan. In the past few days, I have heard the opinions of the professional representatives, women's representatives, and especially the border representatives, and our party has shown sympathetic consideration to them.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Has Greater Power, Showing the Spirit of Democracy</h3>
<p>Wu Zaochi: This draft constitution can fully express the spirit of democratic politics, and can also be in line with the ideological trend of modern constitutions. Since the 19th century, the constitutions of various countries in Europe and the United States, whether internal or external, have been colored by individualism and social ideology. What individualism is fighting for is political equality, and the main purpose of socialism is economic equality. This constitution incorporates these two ideas. Chapter 12 is a concrete manifestation of political equality, and Articles 138 to 142 of Chapter 13 express the spirit of socialism. These two spirits can also be seen everywhere in the entire draft constitution. The legislative branch is particularly clear, and the Legislative Yuan has greater power. Only in this way can the spirit of democratic politics be more enriched. However, we say this not because we think that a constitution is perfect, because we know that this constitution is the result of responding to objective environmental requirements, and it is necessary to add all the basic principles of the Three Principles of the People to write it. If it needs to be modified, it will be more perfect, that is, it must be studied in detail.</p>
<p>Sun Yaofu: This draft does not violate the teachings of the Prime Minister, and it is a combination of the opinions of the Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party. It was formulated by various parties sacrificing their prejudices. Some people think that the powers of the National Assembly are too small. Political power is the power of the people, and the power of the people is exercised by representatives, which is indirect democracy. The National Assembly has the power to elect and recall the president and vice president, and to pass amendments to the constitution, as well as the indirect democratic rights to elect legislators and supervisors. As for the Legislative Yuan's excessive power, direct democracy can be exercised by referendum to reduce it.</p>
<p>Zhang Fengji: Our compatriots in the border areas can all believe in the Three Principles of the People and support the National Government. I hope that we can get equal rights and add a chapter on national autonomy.</p>
<p>Liu Dongyan: I think there are three characteristics in this constitution: (1) It can prevent the emergence of centralized politics. Although the government is not an omnipotent government, it is still a capable government that is compatible with the trend; (2) It can improve civil rights and realize democratic politics; (3) It can reconcile opinions from all parties and achieve the goal of peaceful unification.</p>
<p>Xia Taosheng: The constitution is good as long as it can be compromised. This draft constitution is a comprehensive opinion from all parties, and it is naturally a good constitution if it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Xia Erkang: The chapter on the National Assembly should adopt a proportional representation system to produce representatives, and the number of female representatives should be increased in a considerable proportion.</p>
<p>Li Peitian: The Supreme Economic Commission under the Executive Yuan should be abolished, because it is a structure that competes with the people for profit. Two departments, Overseas Chinese Affairs and Border Administration, should be established separately.</p>
<h3>Women and Professional Representatives Should Participate in the Constitution-Making</h3>
<p>Gu Yuxiu: Article 151 states that if it is necessary to separately determine the implementation procedures for the implementation and amendment of the constitution, it shall be determined by law. Article 146 states that if there is a conflict between the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President, we accept the President's will to implement constitutional government as soon as possible, not to implement the constitution, but to ask the government to implement constitutional government as soon as possible. According to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference to establish the National Government Committee, representatives of the National Assembly, legislators, and supervisors should be increased to expand the base, and women and professions should also participate in the constitution-making organization. The Constitutional Government Promotion Association asks President Chiang to promote the early implementation of constitutional government.</p>
<p>Wei Tingsheng: The teachings of the Father of the Nation are to implement local autonomy first and then implement constitutional government. Now that the constitution has been made, how to realize direct and indirect elections in the future. Also, the power of the Legislative Yuan is not too great, and the power of the Executive Yuan is not too small.</p>
<p>Fan Tengxiao: The reason for establishing the capital in Beiping is that it is better than Nanjing in terms of national defense, economy, and education.</p>
<p>Qin Liankui: The people's lives and property should be protected. This is stipulated in Articles 91 and 16, but personal freedom still needs to be improved, and freedom of residence should retain the guarantees given to the people in the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft.</p>
<p>Chen Yiyun: (1) It should be based on the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution of the Prime Minister's teachings; (2) In the chapter on basic national policy, it is recommended to add an express provision for the protection of female and child workers; (3) Political, economic, educational, and professional should stipulate equal opportunities for women.</p>
<p>Lhadnabadar: It is not necessary to amend the regional quota for the examination system for the border areas. The draft constitution belongs to the people of the whole country, not to one party or one faction. I hope that all parties and factions can sacrifice their prejudices.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan's Bureau of Supply Denies U.S. Business Community's Criticism</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to a recent report by the Associated Press from Washington, the U.S. business community has been very critical of my country's purchase of surplus U.S. goods, saying that the government and officials use it for profit, causing confusion in the domestic economy. The Bureau of Supply of the Executive Yuan yesterday issued a statement to correct this, believing that the U.S. business community's criticism of the Sino-U.S. surplus goods trade event is inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>Female Representative of National Assembly, Social Elite, Liu Chunyi Died in Nanjing, Suffering from Cerebral Hemorrhage, Funeral Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] Liu Chunyi (see picture), a female representative of the National Assembly and social elite, was from Sanyuan, Shaanxi. She was 53 years old and had a plump physique. After the meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd, she returned to the Fourth Guest House. She was fine before KFC that night, but at about 12:00 midnight, a female representative who was close to Liu suddenly noticed that Liu's breathing was abnormal, so she got up to visit her and found that Liu was in a coma. She immediately called the first guest house of the General Secretary's Office of the Dihua and the Central Hospital, etc. Then, many National Assembly staff and doctors rushed to the scene and sent Liu to the Central Hospital for emergency treatment. She was examined by the on-duty teacher, who believed that Liu's illness was acute cerebral hemorrhage, which was caused by high blood pressure. It was found that her blood pressure had reached 180 or more, and blood had entered the bone marrow. Liu was in a coma at the time, with a red face and rapid breathing. After the doctor gave her a strong heart injection and other emergency medications, it was still ineffective. At this time, Hong Lanyou, the Secretary-General of the Assembly, rushed to the Fourth Guest House after hearing the news, but did not see her, and then rushed to the scene with Wang Zuxiang, the Director of the Municipal Health Bureau. The doctor had already told him that there was no hope of recovery. Hong immediately ordered many staff members to do things separately and notified his family to come. Liu passed away at 2:30 AM on the 4th. Hong left the hospital at 5:30 AM and sent the staff of the Secretariat with Liu's second son, Peng Qiya, and many friends at 6:00 AM to escort the body to the funeral home to arrange the funeral. On the morning of the 4th, those who came to mourn were endless, including Yu Youren, staff of the Chinese Women's Movement Committee, the General Secretary's Office of the Assembly, and National Assembly representatives. When the reporters went at 11:30 AM, it happened that more than ten National Assembly female representatives, including Tang Guozhen, Chen Yiyun, Zhang Mojun, and Zhang Xiulan, walked out of Liu's body room. All the representatives had tears on their faces. Representative Zhang Xiulan cried even more loudly, leaning on another representative, walking and crying: "The women's movement has not succeeded and you died again." Her voice was very tragic. Liu's body will be placed in a coffin at 2:00 PM on the 5th. Her second son, Peng Qiya, has gone to the Supervisory Yuan to cry and ask President Yu to commend his mother's deeds.</p>
<h3>Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Office of the President, Resigns</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 4th] A report from Beijing said that Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Office of the President, has submitted his resignation due to poor health. Li plans to go to the United States for half a year to recuperate.</p>
<h3>The Capital Establishment Movement is as Fierce as a Blaze</h3>
<p>— Our reporters, Pu Dejie and Zhang Ming</p>
<p>— A Quick Sketch of the Eighth National Assembly</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua, dragging a black beard, presided over the morning meeting. His Hunan-accented Mandarin was extremely difficult to understand. He announced that the respected female representative from the social sector, Liu Chunyi, had passed away at the Central Hospital on the morning of the 4th due to cerebral hemorrhage. Everyone couldn't hear clearly and asked each other. It wasn't until the moment of standing in mourning that some representatives still thought they were mourning for Representative Zhang Yanmao, who was assassinated in Kaifeng some time ago.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang representative with the longest name, Abulahat Mahsut, spoke generously and passionately. As soon as he took the podium, he was well-received. However, no one understood what he said. After he finished speaking, the representatives from Xinjiang took the lead in applauding, and everyone followed suit. Then, Mai Huanxin, the second son of Masiwd, translated for him. The entire venue greatly sympathized with the content of his speech.</p>
<p>Three members of the Youth Party spoke in the morning. The first, He Luzhi, humbly spoke in principle, saying that national interests are above all else, and that he would follow everyone's lead, etc. The assembly applauded warmly. The second, Yu Jiaju, was slightly more specific, saying that this might not be appropriate and that should be done this way, etc. The applause was sparse. The third, Wang Shihui, specifically argued that the powers of the National Assembly should maintain the provisions of Article 27 of Chapter 3. There was no reaction in the venue. Before the break, Kong Geng said, "Please invite a representative from the Democratic Socialist Party to give some opinions as well!"</p>
<p>Hu Ding'an requested that the people's rights to health and rest be included in the constitution, following the example of the Soviet Constitution. When he mentioned that the Soviet Constitution also stipulates maternity leave for pregnant working women before and after childbirth, the female representatives greatly applauded Lu Dongbin [a Taoist immortal], and the female reporters quickly took notes.</p>
<p>The movement to establish the capital in Beiping is unfolding enthusiastically in the assembly, and it has become as fierce as a blaze. Li Hongwen, a representative from the Shanxi region, and Wu Yanhuan, a representative from the Hebei region, both gave brilliant speeches on the morning of the 4th. When Li spoke of preventing unfavorable factors in steel production, he said: "If the government had been in Beiping during the 'September 18th' Incident, the Northeast Army would never have retreated into the pass without authorization, and the Japanese would not have dared to go deep so easily. Perhaps the incident would not have even happened." Wu then issued a statement regarding some rumors made by certain people about the representatives who advocate establishing the capital in Beiping: "The first rumor is that Northerners advocate establishing the capital in Beiping out of narrow localism. I am from Lugouqiao. Why don't I advocate establishing the capital in Lugouqiao, and call it 'promoting the holy land of war,' etc.? We are Chinese citizens and make this suggestion for national defense. The second rumor is that we Northerners are selfish and self-interested. May I ask: if no one dares to say that the world has achieved lasting peace, who would be willing to have an atomic bomb dropped on their doorstep? The third rumor is that a small newspaper in Nanjing said that our Northern representatives received millions of dollars in bribes, so they advocate establishing the capital in Beiping. This is even more laughable. In short, our suggestion is entirely for the safety of the country and the interests of the nation, and we can swear to Heaven."</p>
<p>Zhou Xing, a representative from Beiping, said to the group of reporters next to him: "In foreign countries, there has never been a problem of the national capital. Now we have one, and two factions have formed. If this problem is not resolved, there will inevitably be conflicts and estrangement in the minds and emotions of our Southern and Northern compatriots, which will be of no benefit to the future of the country. I come from Beiping, and the population of Beiping is really too large. If the government moves there, prices will inevitably rise sharply, and the livelihood of the citizens will be even more difficult. I also believe that if Beiping continues to develop culturally and is not tainted by political struggles, it will definitely have an unparalleled and glorious future. But now is not the time to be selfish. Everyone must prioritize the safety of the country, or else I fear there will be a day of 'partial peace.'"</p>
<p>Statements advocating establishing the capital in Beiping have appeared one after another in the assembly, but the faction advocating establishing the capital in Nanjing has remained silent. This is just like the phenomenon that few people who participated in the constitutional draft review committee spoke. Some say that they may be observing the opinion of the highest authority. But our helmsman, Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Representative Chiang Kai-shek of the assembly, has not attended the assembly for four or five days. The issue of establishing the capital is still a mystery. Many people speculate that the result will be to abolish Article 7, and the status of the national capital will not be rigidly stipulated in the constitution. But what about the situation in the North?</p>
<p>Ruan Yicheng, a representative from Zhejiang, requested leave to return to Hangzhou to handle the county magistrate examination held in Zhejiang Province. He has now completed his official duties and returned to the capital to continue attending the assembly. According to his conversation with our reporter: "The constitutional amendment is indeed better than the May 5th Constitution, especially regarding the powers of the central and local governments, and the provincial and county system, which are not as good in the May 5th Constitution. The May 5th Constitution and the Five-Power Constitution are two different things. Disagreeing with the May 5th Constitution cannot be said to be a violation of the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. However, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly in the constitutional amendment still needs to be considered. The presidential system has its shortcomings, but the speakers of the Legislative Yuan can threaten the president with the National Assembly at any time, which is not a way to seek long-term stability and peace. Perhaps the members of the Legislative Yuan should be elected by the National Assembly, or the members of the Legislative Yuan and the representatives of the National Assembly should be elected by universal suffrage, but they should not hold both positions, which would be more appropriate. As for the issue of the national capital, it is best not to stipulate it in the constitution. If it is clearly designated as Nanjing, it means that there will be no more consideration of any other location, which will disappoint the people of the North; if it is clearly designated as Beiping, then the capital must be moved as soon as the constitution is promulgated, otherwise it will be a violation of the constitution, which is also not allowed by human and financial resources in a short period of time."</p>
<p>Chen Lifu is always a news figure. He did not attend on the afternoon of the 3rd, which was noticed. He attended on the morning of the 4th, and was surrounded by news reporters again. After the meeting adjourned at twelve o'clock, he was crowded from the venue to the gate, and it was difficult to get away.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu used scientific management methods to control the venue and handled it properly. The atmosphere of the meeting was always calm.</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense distributed exquisitely made huge books, "The Great Chairman Chiang," to the representatives at the assembly. During the break, because refreshments had been cancelled, nine out of ten people spent their time on "The Great Chairman Chiang."</p>
<p>It is said that the price of each exquisitely printed copy of [The Great Chairman Chiang] is 66,000 yuan. A representative lost it as soon as he walked out the door.</p>
<p>Xu Chuanlin, an elder of the Democratic Socialist Party, spoke in a Cantonese accent. Few people could understand him. The news reporters all stretched their ears, but still gained little. Yesterday, there was a item in our newspaper's anecdotes about Wu Jingxiong submitting written opinions, which was actually a mistake for Wu 初. This Wu is not that Wu, and is hereby corrected. (December 4th)</p>

<h3>British Hong Kong Troops Kill Compatriots Across the Border: We Lodged a Strong Protest; Britain Expressed Apologies and Took Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] Guo Qihua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, lodged a strong oral protest to the Hong Kong authorities on the night of the 3rd regarding the case of British troops killing our farmers on the border. Commander Festing of the Hong Kong Garrison has made an oral apology to Guo, saying: The soldier has been detained and will be severely punished. At the same time, he said: The British side is preparing to compensate the families of the deceased. Guo dispatched personnel to Shenzhen on the 4th to conduct an on-site investigation of the truth of the case for further negotiations. A spokesman for the Hong Kong Garrison Command said tonight: The department will not issue any statement. Although the incident had long been confirmed by the border police, the spokesman did not confirm or deny the incident at this moment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] The Hong Kong British Army Headquarters announced on the 4th that on the 3rd, a soldier of the British border guards in the New Territories of Kowloon fired a "303" bullet, and the investigation confirmed that it was a misfire. According to a report from the Chinese authorities, the bullet killed a Chinese civilian standing on the Chinese side of the border. The incident is currently under investigation by the military authorities. At the same time, the British military authorities take full responsibility for the death of the deceased and express their deep apologies.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 4th] The British soldier who shot and wounded a Chinese national within the Chinese border yesterday on the Hong Kong-China border has been arrested by the British Command. The British side has set up a court of inquiry to investigate the case. After the incident, the British side wanted to treat the wounded Chinese, but was rejected by Chinese onlookers. The wounded person died soon after.</p>
<p>[Our reporter, Guangzhou, 4th] Regarding the case of British troops killing our residents near Shenzhen on the border between Guangdong and Hong Kong, our reporter took a car to the local area for investigation and learned the following details:</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. on the 3rd, two Chinese children over ten years old were walking along the highway on the Sino-British border and entered Shenzhen on the Chinese side of the Sino-British border crossing at the Man Kam To wooden bridge. They happened to be seen by British troops patrolling the British bridgehead, who crossed the bridge into the Chinese territory and beat the two children. Fortunately, Lu, a police officer of the local Bao'an County Police, witnessed it and stopped them. This caused a dispute. At that time, more and more villagers gathered, and the public was outraged. The British troops were even more furious and said, "One hundred yards of the British border is British territory!" They then entered the bridgehead fortress, set up machine guns, and fired at the Chinese territory. The people fled in all directions. One person was too slow to escape and was shot dead on the spot. The bullet entered from the corner of the forehead and exited from the back of the head. The death was extremely tragic. The deceased was named Zhang Tianxiang, 29 years old, a resident of the 9th Bao of Shenzhen, who made a living as a peddler. He had an elderly mother, younger brother, and younger sister. After the incident, Lu Shen, the company commander of the local Garrison Regiment, immediately dispatched a team to set up哨 posts along the river for alert after hearing the news, and met with Lin Wannian, the chief of the Shenzhen Police Station, and the British military captain. However, the captain actually said that the deceased was shot with a .45 caliber bullet, while the British troops used a .33 caliber bullet, so the bullet was not fired by the British troops. Commander Lu immediately refuted this, and the customs officer of the Shenzhen Kowloon Branch also testified to the British troops' murder across the border. The captain was speechless. Afterwards, the people from all walks of life in Shenzhen held a joint meeting and sent representatives Zheng Qichang (section chief of the county government) and Wen Xuhua (secretary of the county council) to Hong Kong to visit Guo Dehua, our Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, and reported to the Governor's Office in Guangdong. Furthermore, Guo Dehua visited the Governor of Hong Kong and Garrison Commander General Festing late that night. According to the reply, the soldier did not receive an order to fire at that time, and it was only a misfire. Also, the Hong Kong border is now under curfew at night, traffic is cut off, and the Kowloon-Canton Railway has also suspended operations.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hopes the British Side Will Seek a Fair Resolution to the Case of Beating a Hawker to Death</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The case of the British Indian police officer beating hawker Wang Shuixiang to death in Hong Kong has not yet been resolved, and the people of Guangdong Province are outraged. It is recently learned that Vice Minister Gan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently told the British side that our government attaches great importance to this case and hopes it will be resolved quickly and fairly to appease the public. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent several telegrams to the Office of the Special Commissioner for Guangdong and Guangxi in Hong Kong, instructing it to make serious representations to the Governor of Hong Kong on the spot, so as to ensure that the murderer does not escape the law and that the deceased receives compensation. At the same time, the ministry is consulting with the local officials of Guangdong Province to persuade the people to avoid excessive actions.</p>

<h3>Religious "Liquidation"—Congratulations to the 12th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China</h3>
<p>The 12th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China opened in Shanghai yesterday. Our Chairman, despite being preoccupied with numerous affairs, specially issued a congratulatory telegram, in which he said:</p>
<p>"Our country has suffered greatly from this war, and social morality has been severely damaged. Spiritual construction is particularly important. It is hoped that you will embody the spirit of Christ to save the world and save people, promote the truth, awaken society, revitalize the hearts of the decadent and apathetic, and establish a spirit of progress and positivity. The establishment of a new China relies on this." It can be seen that our Chairman has high expectations for the council. It is reported that the 12th Annual Meeting of the Christian Council of China is a grand gathering that has not been held for nine years since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Now that the mountains and rivers have been restored and order has not yet been restored, representatives from all over have gathered together. In addition to promoting the development of church affairs, it is deeply believed that at this time, there will be many emotions. Our Chairman said in his telegram: "Promote the truth, awaken society, counter the hearts of the decadent and apathetic, and establish a spirit of progress and positivity." It is deeply believed that the representatives participating in this Christian Council will repeatedly contemplate these words and gain something from them. Therefore, the convening of this annual meeting of the National Christian Council is not only conducive to the development of Christian affairs, but also conducive to national construction. We hereby express our congratulations on the convening of this conference.</p>
<p>Just as the National Christian Council of China is convening, we have also read in the newspapers about the so-called religious "liquidation" and the so-called "emancipation" movement. According to a dispatch from New York on the 3rd by the Central News Agency, New York Times reporter Li Bowen sent a message from Xuzhou, reporting on the Chinese Communist Party's abuse of Bishop Cai Fasi of the Catholic Church in Daming. It is said that the 53-year-old bishop was expelled from Daming and came to Xuzhou after the CCP occupied Daming. Cai Fasi was subjected to liquidation and interrogation. After being severely beaten during the interrogation by the CCP, he was convicted and fined 30 tons of grain and 47 million yuan in anti-Japanese currency. When Bishop Cai stated that he was unable to pay the fine, the Communist Party confiscated the church and all the furniture and livestock, and confiscated 33 acres of land. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Xi'an on the 3rd by the Central News Agency, the Communist Party recently carried out a vigorous "emancipation" movement in the Sanbian area of northern Shaanxi, forcing the Catholic churches in Wei Zi, Shanqiaopan, Baini井, Heilangwan and other places to hand over church property, and pursuing the annual rent grain and Chinese priests from the church since 1935. Because they could not bear the pressure, they fled one after another. Some were detained by the Communist Party in Sanbian and were subjected to abuse. The transmission of these reports, just as the National Christian Council of China is convening, cannot help but make us feel a lot.</p>
<p>First, the birth of Christ brought new life to mankind. What he left to mankind was the establishment of the Holy Church and the Holy Sacrifice; because of the establishment of the Holy Sacrifice, mankind can approach and integrate with Jesus every day. He only founded one church, but today we see more than a hundred kinds of churches. There is the so-called "Protestant Church" and the so-called "Catholic Church". We know that when Jesus was alive, he did not establish a religion, but only founded a church; the so-called "Catholic Church" should refer to the ancient Jewish religion worshiped by the Jews. All these divergent phenomena make outsiders feel confused. Now that the Christian Council of China is convening in Shanghai, although it can only represent the various denominations of the so-called "Protestant Church", in view of the current situation, it seems unreasonable that those who believe in Christ have dispersed their strength. Therefore, we hope that they can cooperate with each other. This issue of cooperation does not involve faith. Faith is originally free and does not have to be the same; but strength cannot be dispersed. This is a time to focus on construction from the ruins of war, and it is especially important to unite. During the war, the United Kingdom had a so-called "Sword of the Spirit" movement, uniting all the old and new factions under the same banner. The United Christian Relief Fund in America also does not have sectarian differences. Because of the convening of this annual meeting of the National Christian Council of China, we hope that they can have further unity to concentrate their strength on the construction of the new China.</p>
<p>Second, the news transmitted by the Central News Agency is likely to be accurate. The CCP calls for democracy and freedom, but there is absolutely no religious freedom in the CCP's areas. The transmission of this news should strengthen some of our beliefs: First, that communism and religion are two opposing forces, and we must not mislead ourselves and swallow the poison coated with sugar. Second, in order to ensure their religious freedom, those who believe in religion must place their hope on the full realization of the Three Principles of the People. Only under the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People for national construction can they ensure their religious freedom. Now our Chairman and the late Premier were devout Christian believers, not to mention that the Three Principles of the People itself contains a strong Christian spirit. For the benefit of the church itself, the Christian Church should be integrated with the Three Principles of the People. The full realization of the Three Principles of the People is the full realization of the Christian spirit. Therefore, in the religious field, Christian believers should of course embody the teachings created by Christ and strive to practice them. In the political field, Christian believers should study the Three Principles of the People, which are the foundation of the country, and become comrades of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Third, in the cultural field, up to now, the influence of Christianity on our country's ideology and culture is not very significant, and all the influences may not be entirely hygienic for our country's ideology and culture. Superficial Westernization is harmful to the healthy development of our country's ideology and culture. What we want to absorb is the essence of Western civilization centered on Christianity, not its dross. The eastward spread of Buddhism has had a great impact on our ideology and culture, and its influence has not diminished to this day. However, Christianity has not been integrated with the Chinese people to this day. How to make Christianity deeply rooted in the soil of China should be the work that Christianity in China urgently needs to promote in the future. The National Christian Council of China is now convening in Shanghai, and it is deeply believed that there will be careful consideration of this aspect. In the future, if our country's national culture can generate a new force and new brilliance due to the role of Christianity, it is hoped that this will be the case with the convening of the current National Christian Council of China. The so-called "revitalizing the hearts of the decadent and apathetic, and establishing a spirit of progress and positivity," is it here?</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Although the county towns and transportation lines in eastern Hebei have been recovered, the people are still suffering, and most areas have not yet escaped the communist army's harassment and await pacification. Some strongholds still see repeated seesaw battles.

<h3>Communist Army Establishes Banks Everywhere in the Northeast, Indiscriminately Issues Banknotes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 4th] Reporters have confirmed from various sources in the past month that since the communist army infiltrated the Northeast, it has established Northeast, Jijiang, Jihei, and Jilin banks everywhere, illegally printing banknotes, forcibly stipulating that the ratio with the puppet Manchu currency is one to one, and making every effort to exchange puppet Manchu currency for Northeast Bank notes. After the communist army absorbed a large amount of puppet Manchu currency, it secretly carried it to the National Army's recovered areas, or exchanged it for Northeast Nine Provinces circulating notes, or extracted the most materials. This kind of conspiracy is the same as the vile trick used by the Japanese invaders to exchange legal tender for foreign exchange stabilization funds with puppet Central Reserve Bank notes in the early days of the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>Urgent Relief Provided in Northeastern Anhui, A Batch of Disaster Victims to Be Resettled, Popularly Elected Township Chiefs in the Province Must Be Completed by the Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei Dispatch, 4th] This reporter recently interviewed Su Xinmin, Secretary-General of the Anhui Provincial Government, who told me about the relief and food administration situation in northeastern Anhui. This year, 24 counties in northeastern Anhui have suffered from floods and banditry, and the situation is very serious. The provincial government has provided relief in many ways. Recently, the central government allocated 500 million yuan as urgent relief. The provincial government allocated 400 million yuan according to the severity of the disaster in each county. Because the floods were the most severe, the allocation principle was 65% for floods, 25% for banditry, and 10% for famine. The relief funds were allocated to the disaster-stricken counties, and the county governments distributed them to the elderly, weak, women, children, and the extremely poor who had no food and clothing. In addition, the central government has allocated 250 million yuan to provide relief to five counties (all belonging to the pacification zone): Tianchang, Xuyi, Wuhe, Sixian, and Lingbi. Currently, Fan Ren, Director of the Social Affairs Department, is participating in the handling in Bengbu. Therefore, in the 400 million yuan of relief funds, the flood allocation for the above five counties will be waived in order to seek fairness. The remaining 100 million yuan is because some disaster victims in northeastern Anhui have gone to the capital to petition for relief. It is now planned to move this batch of disaster victims to Chengyao Lake in Tongcheng County for reclamation, for the purpose of building houses and settling down. The Anhui Relief Sub-Office will provide transportation and distribute flour, which has the meaning of providing relief through work and is also a long-term living plan for the disaster victims. Otherwise, even if a shocking amount of money is given at once, it will eventually be eaten and used up. As for food administration, Anhui Province borrowed a total of 4.4 million shi this year, and 2.09 million shi should be handed over to the central government. The central government repeatedly telegraphed that it must be paid in full by the end of the year. Director Yang of the Food Department of the central government also came to the province to urge payment. However, the southwest and southern parts of the province are mostly mountainous areas with little grain production, while northeastern Anhui has been exempted from borrowing due to floods and banditry by order of the central government. The central Anhui area has a higher output but has been occupied by the enemy for the longest time. Although more than a year has passed since the victory, the trauma of the people is still deep, and the work of collecting in kind is very difficult. In order to fulfill the mission entrusted by the central government, and at the same time to consider the people's difficulties, the provincial government has ordered the counties to use a portion of the 50% of the grain that the county should get to pay the central government first to meet urgent needs. However, the central government must collect the full amount as scheduled, and in fact, due to disasters in various places, it is difficult to collect this amount in full, which is still a difficult problem.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei News] The provincial government issued a notice to all counties in the province some time ago, implementing popular elections for township chiefs and deputy chiefs, and designated Fuyang, Liu'an, and Tongcheng counties as demonstration areas for popular elections. Currently, the popular elections for township chiefs and deputies in Fuyang and Liu'an counties have been reported to the province for completion. Other counties are mostly in progress. The provincial government has recently issued another notice to all counties in the province, stipulating that popular elections must be completed by the end of the year. However, the newly recovered counties in northeastern Anhui will postpone the elections until next year.</p>
<h3>Suppression and Elimination of Bandits in the Yangcheng Area Approaching Completion, Self-Defense Capabilities of Each County Enhanced, More Than 3,000 Bandits Captured Alive Since February</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] Colonel Liu Nongjun, Chief of Staff of the Paratrooper Headquarters and Commander of the Yangcheng Area Suppression and Elimination, received this reporter on the 4th and issued the following conclusion on the suppression and elimination situation in the past two months: The Yangcheng Area began suppression and elimination in mid-September and has lasted for more than two months. The area east of the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway and the Suzhou-Jiading Highway in the jurisdiction, as well as the entire territory of the three counties of Kunshan, Taicang, and Yushan, can be said to have completely eliminated the atmosphere of banditry. Therefore, it is preparing to gradually end the suppression and elimination mission, because the strengthening of the self-defense military force in each county in the second phase of the plan, this headquarters believes, has been effectively achieved. The trained self-defense team members include 283 in Suzhou, 195 in Kunshan, 165 in Taicang, 692 in Jiading, 700 in Baoshan, 985 in Changshu, and 459 in the Suzhou-Wuxi border area, totaling 3,499 people, which is sufficient to take responsibility for defending the local area and preventing bandits. The household registration and water conservancy of each county have also been completely reorganized. As for road transportation, much has been repaired, including the section of the Jinghu Highway from Taicang to Wuxi, the middle section of the Kun-Tai County Road, the various sections of the Liuzhou-Baiyuan-Kou-Zhitang Triangle Area, and the entire line from Changshu to Jiangyin. It can now pass smoothly, which is very beneficial to military transportation. Statistics show that about 3,000 bandits have been captured alive in the past two months, and more than 100 various types of firearms, including machine guns, rifles, and pistols, have been seized. Therefore, there should be no problem with public security in the Yangcheng Area in the future.</p>

<h3>Former Tiantai County Magistrate Indicted for Corruption and Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Ding Guoming, the former magistrate of Tiantai County, was indicted for corruption and dereliction of duty during his tenure. At the end of last month, the Shaoxing District Court found the facts to be true after investigation and filed a public prosecution. In addition to Ding himself, those listed as defendants include Ding Jinhuai, the secretary who was Ding's corrupt claw during his tenure, and Ren Zihua, the chief of the county tax office. In addition, Ding Guoming instigated Dai Liansheng, the head of the investigation section of the county intelligence team, to assassinate Yu Naiheng, the chief prosecutor of the Tiantai District Court, because he repeatedly arrested his claws and brought them to justice, firing two shots and narrowly escaping the attack. This spring, when the Zhejiang Higher Court sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, Ding Guoming was worried and abandoned his post and fled in the dead of night. Chen Peidong and Dai Liansheng, who were related to the assassination case, were eventually arrested and sentenced to death by the Tiantai Court.</p>
<h3>Repairing the Wolf Mountain Temple</h3>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch] The five Purple Wolf Mountains stand tall along the riverbank, shielding Tong City. Across the river, they face Yu County's Fortune Mountain, forming a natural barrier for river defense. The Wolf Mountain Temple is a scenic wonder, with the sounds of bells and drums echoing, making it a well-known scenic area in Northern Jiangsu. The White Robe Nunnery on the mountainside, built during the Tang Dynasty, is one of the famous ancient temples. Located on the southern slope of the mountain, it boasts the Tower of Sea View, particularly magnificent. The structure is exquisite, offering a panoramic view of the river and sky. Tourists from both sides of the Yangtze River flocked to visit, their carriages and hats intermingling, undeterred by the heat. Since the Anti-Japanese War, it had suffered from enemy and puppet forces' trampling, falling into disrepair. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), a fire broke out unexpectedly, destroying over ten rooms. Towers, pavilions, and refined chambers were reduced to ashes. As this temple is crucial to the scenic spots of the mountains, how could its decline be tolerated? Therefore, the Nantong branch of the Buddhist Association had long considered renovating it. However, due to years of dwindling incense offerings, they lacked the means to finance the construction. Recently, the Nantong Reconstruction Committee resolved to reorganize the temples and the Wolf Mountain scenic area. Thus, the temple's renovation became an urgent matter. Zhi Liang, the chairman of the Buddhist Association, sold ancestral farmlands to fund the repairs, hoping to restore the local landmark.</p>
<h3>Special District Office Established for Chongming and Shengsi Islands, Under Direct Command and Jurisdiction of the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Provincial Government passed the following resolutions at its 72nd regular meeting on the 3rd: (1) If Ru Gao County Magistrate Xie Wencen is transferred to the province, Jian Dichu will serve as acting magistrate. (2) Sun Yunda is appointed as acting district chief of the Shengsi Direct-Controlled District.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] According to Provincial Government Secretary-General Chen, the significance of establishing the Shengsi Special District Office is as follows: Recently, the Provincial Government established a Special District Office for the Shengsi Islands, which belong to the 5th District of Chongming County, under the direct command and jurisdiction of the Provincial Government, which is of great significance. The island is over 200 li away from Chongming, making it difficult to administer by the county due to environmental conditions. Therefore, the Provincial Government has established the Shengsi Special District Office, following the example of provinces like Fujian and Jiangxi, to meet practical needs. The abundant fish production there makes it the premier fishing market in Southeast China. During the fishing season, the number of fishing boats and the population often increase dramatically to over 300,000, leading to a prosperous economy. However, if the political administration there is poor, it can easily be controlled by local bullies and landlords, greatly affecting public security. Given the current situation, the area has strong economic conditions. If managed properly, its future development is limitless.</p>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch] Ru Gao County Magistrate Xie Wencen was ordered by the province to take on another position. Jian Dichu has been appointed to replace him. Mr. Jian is currently the director of the Confidential Office of the First Pacification Headquarters. It is said that he will assume his post in Ru Gao as soon as he completes the handover within the headquarters.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu High Court Will Not Move to Zhenjiang; Four Measures for the Aftermath of the Suzhou Jailbreak</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] Sun Honglin, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, recently returned to Suzhou after inspecting the judiciary in Northern Jiangsu. Hearing this news, our reporter paid him a special visit to inquire about the potential relocation of the High Court to Zhenjiang and his impressions from the inspection. Although Mr. Sun was covered in dust from his week-long journey, he was in high spirits. In a clear and cheerful tone, he exchanged greetings with the reporter and solemnly denied any plans to relocate the High Court to Zhenjiang, stating: The buildings currently under construction in Zhenjiang are for the use of a branch of the High Court. If the main court were to move, it would be necessary to build a large number of additional structures, which the court simply does not have the financial resources for. Reports in Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai stating otherwise are unlikely to be confirmed within the next two or three years. As for his impressions from the inspection, he only visited Jiangdu and Taixian in Northern Jiangsu due to pressing matters at the court. In terms of the judiciary, the local areas are becoming increasingly prosperous, leading to a growing number of lawsuits. The staff members are also working diligently. However, the number of inmates is increasing daily, and the detention centers are inadequate and in need of repair. Plans are currently underway to add some new facilities. Generally speaking, Taixian is better than Jiangdu. The city is clean and tidy, the roads in the suburbs are smooth, and the communication network is sound. All aspects are well-coordinated with the judiciary, which is particularly gratifying. Chief Judge Han is currently still in Taixian, preparing to inspect Nantong next week, at which time I also plan to visit and then return to Suzhou together. When asked about the handling of the aftermath of the jailbreak at the Wudi District Detention Center, he replied: The court has decided on four points: (1) Continue to pursue the escaped prisoners, (2) Strengthen security at the detention center to prevent future incidents, (3) Build new prisons, (4) Transfer administrative responsibility to the Ministry of Justice for review.</p>
<h3>Another Inland River Steamer Experiences Boiler Explosion</h3>

<h3>Shandong Province Promotes Cotton, Tobacco, and Homespun Cloth as Central Economic Development Projects for Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch] The Shandong Provincial Economic and Construction Conference held its closing ceremony at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. Secretary-General Liu Daoyuan, County Magistrate Ding Jishi, and representatives from various districts and counties attended.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Ding Jishi of the Provincial Government stated that after eight years of war, the province's construction was completely destroyed, the rural economy was bankrupt, and the people's livelihoods were in decline. To revitalize the rural areas and improve the lives of farmers, it is necessary to promote agricultural production and advocate for handicrafts to regulate the economy and lives of farmers. Therefore, at the Provincial Economic and Construction Conference, the central tasks for the 36th year (1947) were determined, such as the promotion of cotton cultivation in Qidong, the promotion of tobacco cultivation in Linzi, the improvement of tussah silk production in Linqu, the improvement of homespun cloth production in Weixian, and the construction of water conservancy irrigation and wells. After unanimous approval by the conference, methods will be formulated separately and implemented step by step.</p>

The team is also issuing "Plague Prevention Vaccination Certificates" to facilitate the promotion of disease prevention work.</p>
<h3>Hai Area's Great Plains Suitable for Agricultural Machinery</h3>
<p>Wu Peijun Requests the Ministry of Agriculture to Establish a Factory Locally</p>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] Wu Peijun, a native of the Hai area in Jiangsu, believes that the Hai area's great plains are suitable for the application of agricultural machinery. He recently submitted a request to Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, asking for permission to establish a manufacturing plant in a convenient location in Lianyungang City to innovate both the salt and agricultural industries. The original text of Wu's request to Minister Zhou is as follows:</p>
<p>"I have investigated that the Hai area, encompassing the four counties of Guanyun, Donghai, Muyang, and Ganyu, is the largest plain in Northern Jiangsu. With no lakes or marshes and few hills, the terrain is vast and boundless. In ancient times, the Hai area was known as a major agricultural region and a granary for wheat and beans, which is no exaggeration. At a time when the development of Northern Jiangsu is being highly touted, if new types of machinery can be used for farming, not only will the existing cultivated land in the Hai area increase production several times, but also the thousands of acres of salt flats along the coast can be deeply ploughed and drained of brine. Within three years, they will surely be transformed into fertile land, and there is even the possibility of creating a cotton production center. Therefore, I believe that the Hai area's great plains are the most suitable experimental area for agricultural machinery in Northern Jiangsu. I recently heard that your ministry, entrusted by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), is establishing a general agricultural machinery manufacturing plant in Shanghai and fourteen branch plants in other important regions. This is the beginning of agricultural innovation and development, breaking the thousands-year-old agricultural tradition of China, and I am delighted and celebrating this grand plan. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, farmers in the Hai area fled their homes, and most of their farming tools were destroyed. Unfortunately, this year they also suffered from the breach of the Mu River, which caused further destruction. Therefore, I earnestly request that your ministry establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing branch plant in Lianyungang City in the coastal area. In addition to the various reasons mentioned above, the objective conditions are also very favorable: (1) The city is the center of the border area between the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan. Using it as the starting point for transporting manufactured agricultural tools is a shortcut. (2) It is not far from Shanghai, and it is easy to import the raw materials needed for manufacturing agricultural tools by boat. (3) The four salt farms of Taiping, Zhongzheng, Linxing, and Jinan under the jurisdiction of Huaibei are connected to the city, and their pool water pumping machines need to be replenished. Considering both aspects, simultaneous manufacturing would be a win-win solution, and it would also be a surefire way to reduce costs, balance salt prices, and align them with the salt prices of Changlu."</p>

<p>Letter to the World Education and Culture Conference</p>
<p>Subject: Proposal that the World Charter should explicitly stipulate: "The state bears full responsibility for the care, education, and elderly care of its citizens; and its purpose should be purely out of universal love, equality, mutual assistance, peace, and the ideal of a world for all, promoting the advancement of humanity."</p>
<p>Throughout history, the educational opportunities of citizens of all countries have been subject to complex and divergent differences based on their family circumstances, their parents' abilities, and their personal experiences. This has made it impossible to achieve universal equality and to provide education to all. As a result, countless talents have been buried, the rate of progress has been hampered, and human happiness has been diminished, to an extent that cannot be quantified. This unavoidable reality is a matter of deep concern for all enlightened individuals around the world and is considered the most painful and pitiful.</p>
<p>I believe that as long as there are still national organizations in the world, it is pointless to discuss "education, culture, and science issues." If we are to discuss this issue, then "the state is the parent of all men and women in the country, and all men and women in the country are the children of the state." The important conditions for caring for infants and educating young people worldwide to achieve the ideal of a world for all are "providing for the young" and "employing the strong"... These noblest, greatest, and most reasonable ideals of human society should be the full responsibility of each country. They should not be entrusted to families with complex circumstances, parents with limited abilities, or unpredictable experiences. This leads to countless excellent and healthy infants and young people being deprived of "care" and "education," being frustrated, broken, becoming unproductive, injured, or dying young, causing immeasurable losses to human society worldwide. This situation has existed since ancient times, but it has become particularly evident in the 20th century, with the convenience of transportation, the development of commerce and industry, and people's drunken obsession with capitalism and the "powerful delusion" of aggression. This has led to two world wars in thirty years and several small-scale wars between nations and ethnic groups in fifty years, causing excessive destruction and an extreme polarization of wealth. Just look at the powerless families and parents around the world. They are already struggling to save lives, let alone being able to use reasonable and healthy methods to "care for and educate" their children! They can only resign themselves to fate, letting them live and die on their own, with no recourse! What a pity?! What a pity?! Enough! This stark reality is a matter of deep concern for all enlightened individuals around the world and is considered the most painful and pitiful.</p>
<p>Indeed, modern nations around the world all regard "caring for citizens" and "educating citizens" as important national policies. Various institutions such as infant care centers and nurseries have sprung up in response. However, the majority are still localized and have failed to achieve universal coverage. Even for early childhood education and compulsory education, while free provisions are often in place, secondary education, vocational education, and university education, while also having provisions for some or all public funding, are all fragmented and incomplete. Furthermore, in the current stage where the private property system has not been eradicated, the principle of people's livelihood has not been realized, and the social economy is still developing abnormally, without methods to ensure that male and female infants and young people can enjoy "equal care" and "equal education," these fragmented and incomplete measures will have no real and thorough benefits. Moreover, the motivations of various countries in vigorously "caring for" and "educating" their citizens have not yet reached the "Great Harmony ideal" of purely stemming from universal love, equality, mutual assistance, peace, and a world for all, promoting the advancement of humanity. They still inevitably have many ethnic groups and nations that, in order to fulfill their "powerful delusions," use young people as strong tools for "aggression" and "self-defense," exhibiting the selfish and narrow-minded "small prosperity thinking" that hinders human progress.</p>
<p>I believe that in a reasonable human society, human nation, human world, male and female infants should be "cared for by society," "cared for by the nation," and "cared for by the world" from birth. From the ages of four to twenty-four, this period should be covered by "education by society," "education by the nation," and "education by the world."</p>
<p>I believe that infants receiving care from reasonable and healthy health institutions is a "right that they should enjoy" in a reasonable human society, human nation, and human world. It should not be entrusted to parents without health knowledge or sufficient abilities, leading to malnutrition or improper hygiene, resulting in them being unhealthy or dying young. Similarly, young men and women receiving education from reasonable educational institutions is also a "right that they should enjoy," rather than what is commonly referred to today as "compulsory education."</p>
<p>The duration of my proposed "right to care" and "right to education" should be at least twenty-four years. During these twenty-four years, the great tasks of "managing," "educating," "nurturing," and "protecting health" should be fully the responsibility of the state, "caring for" and "educating" them into healthy and useful talents. After the age of twenty-five, until the age of sixty, these thirty-five years should be dedicated to serving the advancement of humanity. Our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen said, "Life is for service." This refers to these thirty-five years of strong knowledge, ability, and physique. After the age of sixty, as mental and physical strength gradually declines, one should enjoy the "right to elderly care." At this time, "the elderly are the parents, and the world, society, and nation are the children."</p>
<p>I believe that only with "rights and obligations that are equally balanced" can we achieve the Great Harmony society, the Great Harmony nation, and the Great Harmony world. Only a reasonable and healthy society, nation, and world can endure and remain eternally new.</p>
<p>Originally, humans are born with the "rights to care, education, and elderly care." However, in the past, these obligations were borne by uneven and unhealthy families and parents and children. Now, my proposal is that these obligations should be borne by a uniform and healthy state. Although, the state directly bears these obligations, indirectly they are borne by society and the world. Therefore, I believe that this proposal should be directly suggested to the nation and indirectly suggested to society and the world.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that: "A reasonable human society, human nation, and human world can only realize truly equal "rights and obligations" in this way. Only a truly reasonable "human society, human nation, and human world" can achieve lasting peace and reasonable progress. (Wu Yourong, Taiwan)</p>

<h3>US Policy Towards Spain Adheres to Non-Intervention Principle; Opposes Coercive Actions, Conflicts with French and Soviet Views</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 2nd] US Representative Connally declared in the UN Political Committee today that the US resolution on Spain proposed yesterday aims to restore a democratic government in that country and does not suggest intervention. Connally pointed out: (1) The US opposes Franco and welcomes democratic reforms in that country that protect human rights and freedoms. (2) If the Franco regime threatens international peace and security, the US is willing to participate in any necessary sanctions actions in accordance with the Charter. (3) Before the occurrence of the aforementioned state, the US opposes coercive actions by the United Nations such as severing diplomatic relations, as these actions could promote Franco's unity of the domestic people against the outside world or promote the outbreak of a civil war in Spain, plunging its people into suffering. (4) The US will continue to oppose the participation of the Franco regime in the United Nations agencies and the international organizations initiated by these agencies. (5) Finally, the United States believes that the Spanish people should determine their fate. Connally stressed that the United States fully adheres to the principle of non-intervention, which is the basic point of American foreign policy, and said that the resolution he proposed yesterday does not conflict with this principle.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] The UN Political Committee discussed the Spanish issue today for more than six hours and then adjourned until the 4th to continue. Britain and the United States did not approve of the United Nations taking direct coercive action against Franco's Spain, thus creating a sharp split with France and the Soviet bloc. France, the Soviet Union, etc. wanted all member states of the United Nations to immediately cut off relations with Franco. The United States believes that such severe action could lead to another war. British Representative Shawcross agreed with the US proposal, which demanded that Franco step down, support a provisional government, and then replace it with a freely elected government. It is said that Britain will not take any action to cause bloodshed over the issue of the Spanish government, whether it is the blood of British soldiers or the blood of Spanish people.</p>
<h3>Connally's Proposal Displeases Both Sides; Franco Government Protests</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 4th] Spanish Foreign Minister Otayyer today handed a note to the US representative in Spain, protesting against the US representative Connally's proposal to prohibit Spain from participating in UN organizations, saying that this proposal offends the Spanish people. The current government of Spain was established in July 1936, in the battle to resist communist tyranny, and was bought at the cost of blood. The people of the whole country can testify to this. The current Spanish regime never participated in the Axis powers during the war. The Spanish volunteers who participated in the German army only accounted for 2% of the total number of Spanish troops. There was also an "International Division" in the Soviet army. Spain only followed its example and allowed volunteers to enlist.</p>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 4th broadcast: The exiled Prime Minister of the Spanish Republic, Gilral, and the Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, Zore, both issued warnings today, stating that if the United Nations General Assembly cannot reach a positive solution to the Spanish issue, then "direct action" should be taken to overthrow Franco.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 3rd] The President of the Provisional Government of the Spanish Republic, Li Beier, told this agency today that the US Representative Connally's proposal on Franco's Spain in the UN Political Committee appears to be very weak at first glance and does not propose any concrete plan to end the Franco regime. The Spanish Republicans cannot help but express disappointment with this attitude of the United States. As for Connally's remarks after the proposal was made, they are even more unfounded.</p>
<h3>Economic Unification Plan for Germany: Britain and the US to Invite France and the Soviet Union to Participate; Four Foreign Ministers to Discuss German Peace Treaty Within the Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 2nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin told reporters today that the agreement between Britain and the United States to unify the economies of their respective zones in Germany could begin to alleviate the economic difficulties Britain is experiencing due to its burden in Germany. Bevin emphasized that the agreement was not aimed at any other government and was purely based on necessity. US Secretary of State Byrnes also told reporters at another location that the US is willing to enter into similar agreements with the Soviet Union or France, or to participate in a plan for economic unification. He believes that the agreement will reduce unemployment, increase food supply, and further stabilize order. Byrnes further explained that the agreement classifies German imports into two categories: (1) imports necessary to prevent disease and unrest, and (2) imports necessary to maintain a self-sufficient economic system. Foreign exchange earned from exports from the two zones will be managed by a joint agency and used primarily to pay for the second category of imports. The agreement is effective from January 1, 1947, and is limited to the economic aspects, so the political independence of the two zones will continue to be maintained. [Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] Semi-official French sources commenting on the British-American agreement to unify their occupation zones in Germany said that the agreement will not change France's position and that France has not yet agreed to include the French occupation zone in the unification. France's position on this issue remains the same as previously stated: France will defend its position during the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the future of the Ruhr area.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] Diplomatic sources stated today that the Council of Foreign Ministers is currently working to finalize the peace treaties with five Axis satellite states. However, the signing of the treaties will likely be delayed until early next year due to mechanical problems in printing the final official text of the treaties. The four major powers hope to conclude the work on these five treaties within the week and then begin a preliminary study of the initial issues of the German peace treaty before the end of the week. The four foreign ministers have scheduled a meeting in Europe early next year to discuss the German issue. The signing of the five satellite states' treaties may be postponed until then. The agreement between Britain and the US on the economic unification of their occupation zones in Germany appears to have strengthened their position in negotiating with the Soviet Union and France.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly to Re-discuss General Disarmament Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Both the US and Britain today advocated that the UN immediately take action to implement a global disarmament system, without the use of veto power. The British side implicitly indicated that this issue was being "obstructed" by the Soviet side. The disarmament issue was postponed for 24 hours at the request of the Soviet Union to express "very important" remarks related to disarmament.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Leaders Hold Individual Talks; Jinnah Still Insists on Original Position; Indian Home Minister Condemns Indian Communist Party in Speech</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, London, 4th] British Prime Minister Attlee met with Jinnah, leader of the Indian Muslim League, today in an attempt to break the current deadlock in India, but the outcome was not encouraging. According to well-informed sources, Jinnah clearly told Attlee that the Muslim League would never unconditionally abandon its political and religious demands. The Muslim side believes that Britain's plan for Indian independence does require the party to abandon its political and religious demands.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 4th Broadcast: The Governor-General of India, Wavell, has made some progress in his efforts to make Nehru understand the danger of internal strife. He is trying to get Nehru to allow a provincial system, which is what the Muslim League insists on. In addition, Wavell is also putting strong pressure on the Muslim League to cooperate loyally with the Congress Party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Today is the tenth day of the Muslim Moharram festival, a day of mourning and remembrance. Therefore, the King's banquet for Indian leaders at Buckingham Palace has been postponed to tomorrow. The Secretary of State for India, Lawrence, held private talks with Nehru and Jinnah yesterday. Nehru also had a two-hour meeting with Attlee. The Sikh representative, Singh, also went to 10 Downing Street yesterday afternoon for a preliminary broad discussion with the British Prime Minister. Nehru then went to the House of Commons, where he met Kurt Schumacher, the leader of the German Social Democratic Party who came to London at the invitation of the Labour Party, after being introduced by Labour MP Sorensen. Informal talks will continue today. It is expected that the British-Indian roundtable conference will be officially held tomorrow. [Reuters, Bombay, 4th] The Indian Interim Government's Home Minister, Patel, a member of the Congress Party, addressed a large group of workers here today, accusing Indian communists of attempting to achieve their goals through riots, strikes, and industrial sabotage. He urged workers to emulate the British Labour Party, enter the stage of workers' rule, and not be misled by the communists to engage in strikes and other behaviors, which would only harm themselves and the country.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd] The issue of India, independence or civil war, hangs by a thread. British Prime Minister Attlee, Secretary of State for India Lawrence, Minister of Commerce Cripps, and Minister of Defense Alexander began emergency consultations here today with Indian leaders separately. The British representatives also warned that India's large population and vast territory are essential to world peace. According to a Washington dispatch, US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson declared at a press conference that if the leaders of various factions in India can seize the opportunity to build a stable and peaceful India, it will not only benefit India but also the world.</p>
<h3>French National Assembly Elects Speaker Auriol; Election of Prime Minister Awaits Final Announcement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The French National Assembly elected veteran Socialist member Auriol as Speaker with 284 votes, maintaining his record of serving three terms as Speaker. Communist candidate Cachin received 170 votes, and Radical Party candidate Van Lanonne (former Governor-General of Vietnam) received 98 votes, all losing the election. The People's Republican Movement's support for Auriol is widely regarded as an indication that the Socialists are willing to support the People's Republican Movement to assume the position of Prime Minister. This election of Speaker can also be regarded as a test of strength for the Communist Party in its competition for the leadership of the government. Auriol is a former leader of French Socialism, a student of Jaurès, and a close friend of the current Socialist Party leader Blum. He is also a member of the Socialist Party's Executive Committee.</p>
<p>[French Press Agency, Paris, 4th] The Socialist Party National Committee held a meeting all night last night, passing a motion supporting a Communist government led by Thorez with 3,121 votes against 845.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 4th Broadcast: The French Communist Party hopes to lead the interim government, but is opposed by the People's Republican Movement and the right-wing Radical Socialist Party. The above two parties stated that they are unwilling to vote for Thorez as Prime Minister. When the new parliament meets this afternoon, Thorez must obtain an absolute majority of 310 votes to win the position of Prime Minister, but this seems impossible.</p>
<p>Also, according to a Paris broadcast on the 4th: The preliminary results of the election of Thorez as Prime Minister have been announced. He only received 259 votes out of 579, and has not yet gained the support of an absolute majority. The voting will continue tomorrow morning. Field Marshal Montgomery Leaves Athens for Rome</p>

<h3>Control of Japanese Narcotics and Corrosive Addictive Substances; We Offer Seven Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] At today's meeting of the United Nations Narcotics Committee, the Chinese representative, Shi Siming, made seven recommendations on the control of Japanese narcotics: (1) Prohibit the manufacture or modification of narcotic raw materials. (2) Establish a narcotics warehouse in the proposed Far East Branch, or designate a location for the storage of drugs as recommended by the Committee and specified by the Economic and Social Council. (3) The UN narcotics warehouse may export drugs for medical and scientific purposes, but the quantity must not exceed the amount estimated by the supervisory authority. (4) The Japanese government should strictly control the distribution of narcotics within Japan and submit monthly reports to the UN. (5) The drug warehouse should be strictly guarded. (6) Prohibit the export of narcotics. (7) All control measures for narcotics should be subject to UN supervision. In addition, Shi recommended the establishment of a seven-member committee to study the control of narcotics in Japan and Korea.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Stalin's Critical Illness; Speculation Arises Again About Successor; Soviet Newspapers Heavily Promote Molotov</h3>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, 3rd] Local newspapers today again published news of Marshal Stalin's serious illness. According to a political visitor from Zaining who learned from reliable sources, Stalin's condition is critical, and all important Soviet figures and Stalin's closest friends are by his side. Stalin has not recovered since falling ill this spring, and his condition is now worsening. The Taisivai newspaper also reported that according to political sources in the Bulgarian capital, Stalin's condition is deteriorating, and medicine is ineffective; however, neither newspaper specified the nature of his illness. According to a prominent figure who recently returned from Moscow, Stalin's health is a taboo subject, and the newspapers are publishing photos of Foreign Minister Molotov with increasing frequency, which is quite noteworthy. A dispatch from Moscow on the 7th of last month stated that Stalin's health was good and that he was taking a vacation. This telegram was delayed for 12 days due to censorship.</p>
<p>Soviet newspapers are trying to select Stalin's successor, and have been heavily promoting Molotov's recent election as an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Many diplomats and others previously speculated that Molotov would not succeed Stalin as the leader of the Soviet Union, but in light of the Soviet newspapers' promotion of him as Stalin's right-hand man, their views have changed again. Stalin did not attend the October Revolution anniversary celebrations. Foreign observers believe that Stalin may retire, and are speculating about his successor. The following six people are considered the most likely: (1) Malenkov, currently 45 years old, formerly a member of the Communist Party Politburo, recently transferred from party work to administrative work in October, serving as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and is known as the "master of the art of power." His position is similar to that of Stalin when Lenin died in 1924. (2) Zhdanov, a purely party worker, formerly Stalin's representative in Leningrad, and credited with defending the city during the Battle of Leningrad. He also delivered a speech on behalf of Stalin at this year's Revolution anniversary. (3) Beria, a native of Georgia and Stalin's fellow countryman, in charge of the confidential work of developing Soviet atomic energy. (4) Andreyev, a leader of collective farms. (5) Mikoyan, Minister of Foreign Trade. (6) Kaganovich, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, a Jew. If Molotov is to be Stalin's successor, it would be unexpected.</p>
<h3>Lewis Appears in Court for Sentencing; Found Guilty of Contempt of Court; Lewis Defends Himself in Court; Coal Strike Unabated; Freight Transport Prohibited; Mail Also Restricted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Lewis, with a strong attitude, is scheduled to appear in court today to hear Judge Goldsborough's sentencing for his contempt of court injunction. The severity of the punishment is at the court's discretion, and there are no legal restrictions on the imposition of any imprisonment or fines. Lewis's Mine Workers Union has also been accused of contempt of court for the strike injunction, and may face enormous financial penalties. Lewis is scheduled to reappear in court at 3:00 PM (11:00 PM Shanghai time) for sentencing. According to officials familiar with the situation, Assistant Attorney General Sonnerd's staff all support the continuation of the strike for one day, which would mean a fine of $2 million per day for the Mine Workers Union, and severe fines or imprisonment for Lewis. However, the judge is still seeking the government's opinion and asking Lewis's lawyers to make suggestions, which is not common in American courts, but not unprecedented. Before the court has ruled, Lewis's lawyers have prepared a plan to quickly appeal against the federal court's decision. Labor unions are currently supporting Lewis.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The chairman of the Mine Workers Union, Lewis, was found guilty of contempt of court today, while the coal miners' strike continued. After hearing the verdict, Lewis gave a defiant speech in court, accusing the judge of depriving coal miners of their constitutional rights, and declaring that he would maintain this position. After this dramatic scene, Judge Goldsborough pondered in the silent courtroom for about four minutes before announcing adjournment. The sentence will be announced tomorrow. According to legal regulations, a fine or imprisonment may be imposed. The government is working hard to deal with the coal miners' strike, prohibiting all freight transport except for necessities, and further reducing the mileage of railway coal-fired locomotives carrying passenger cars by 25%. The post office is also implementing strict new rules for parcels, restricting the size of parcels and prohibiting the mailing of overseas parcels from this Friday, except for those sent to US military personnel.</p>
<p>[French Press Agency, Washington, 3rd] Democratic Senator Johnston visited President Truman today, requesting the President to deliver a broadcast speech calling on coal miners to return to work. Democratic Senator Fuller said that the federal court's verdict on Lewis's contempt of court is not legal under American law, and may be overturned.</p>
<h3>General Strike Occurs in Oakland City Area</h3>
<p>[United Press, Oakland, California, 3rd] A general strike has occurred in the Oakland city area, with a population of no less than one million. Public transportation has completely stopped, four daily newspapers have failed to publish, most stores are closed, and all factories have shut down. The strikers number 130,000.

<h3>To Cope With World Competition; Lancashire Cotton Industry to Undergo Complete Reform; Government Provides Loans to Replace Old Machinery</h3>
<p>[French Press Agency, Manchester, 3rd] British Secretary of Commerce Cripps announced a five-year plan today to modernize and develop the cotton industry in Lancashire. According to the plan, for cotton manufacturers who want to eliminate old machinery and replace it with new machinery, the government will provide a loan of one-quarter of the cost, interest-free. This measure only applies to factories with more than 500,000 spindles. The main objective of the government's plan is to merge smaller factories to increase their efficiency. Cripps pointed out that the British cotton industry is old and cannot stand the strain. If it is not reformed, it will gradually be eliminated. In the 19th century, the cotton industry was the second largest industry in Britain, second only to the coal mining industry. At that time, the Lancashire cotton mills employed 350,000 workers, but today only 200,000 remain, and production has declined. There are many reasons for the decline in production, the main reason being outdated machinery. Most of the machinery in British textile mills is more than 50 years old, and workers find it extremely difficult to use this type of machinery. Whenever they have the opportunity, they switch to other modern industries. At the same time, since the 20th century, the development of the textile industries in other countries, especially Japan, India, and Brazil, has become a strong competitor to Britain, further highlighting Britain's backwardness. The British government's current problem is to increase production to cope with world competition. There are only two ways to increase production: to increase the number of workers or to replace machinery.</p>

<h3>UNRRA to End; Meeting to Be Held Next Tuesday; Seeking to Resolve Two Most Pressing Issues; Goods Shipped to China Will Not Arrive Until Next Summer</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] UNRRA will hold a meeting here next Tuesday, which will be the formal start of the end of the largest relief organization in the world. When UNRRA settles its accounts, it will try to resolve the two most pressing issues: (1) How to provide assistance to the more than ten countries facing malnutrition this winter; (2) How to provide relief to the millions of displaced people in Europe. UNRRA has played a major role. When the last shipment of goods is cleared next summer, the relief goods shipped by UNRRA will reach 22 million gross tons, worth $3,680,913,840. Of this amount, the United States donated 73%, and the rest was provided by other countries that did not directly experience aggression. On March 31, 1947, UNRRA will stop shipping supplies to Asia, but it will generally take the entire summer for the shipments to reach their destinations. The supplies shipped to China account for the largest amount, worth approximately $750 million. The transportation work has been hampered by the US seamen's strike and the congestion of Shanghai port. As of October 30, 1946, UNRRA had shipped 1,400,106 tons of supplies to China.</p>

<h3>How Much Compensation Will Each Country Receive? It Will Depend on the Far Eastern Commission. The Japanese Are Concerned About the Fate of Their Merchant Fleet.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] The Central News Agency exclusively learned today: the industrial machinery that Japan will be allowed to retain may be 25% more than what Pauley suggested to President Truman in his compensation plan; the larger merchant ships allowed to be retained may be 33% more than the Pauley plan. How much compensation the Allied nations will ultimately receive from Japan depends on the decision of the Far Eastern Commission in Washington. Since February, the Commission has been constantly receiving opinions from MacArthur. Based on longer research and constantly revised statistics, MacArthur's suggestions seem more likely to become the reference for the Far Eastern Commission and its affiliated organizations when making final decisions, compared to the Pauley plan, which was based on the overall command of the Allied headquarters in the early days of the occupation. Regarding the total amount of industrial machinery and equipment Japan needs to maintain a minimum peacetime economy, MacArthur's suggested figures are higher than Pauley's; although the former's estimates for various Japanese industries differ from the latter's, on average, they are 25% higher. As for the issue of how many merchant ships will be allowed to be retained, which the Japanese government is very concerned about, MacArthur suggests allowing them to retain 2 million tons, without expressing any opinion on the navigation range of 500,000 tons of them; while the figures in the Pauley plan are similar to MacArthur's, it stipulates that all Japanese merchant ships must navigate within the Far East waters, which is the most worrying point for Japan in the Pauley plan. Although the U.S. Navy authorities, the British Empire, and the Netherlands have requested that the Allied nations seriously consider restricting Japan's navigation range for several years to come, it is understood that the United States, in principle, does not want to deprive Japan of its freedom of navigation. It is expected that this major issue will not be decided before the Japanese peace conference is held, as it is more closely related to the long-term control of the Japanese economy by the Allied nations than the current compensation plan. The tonnage of Japanese merchant ships that has been granted so far is about 1 million tons; before the war, Japan had a total of 2,730 merchant ships, or 6.3 million tons. According to MacArthur's suggestion to allow them to retain 2 million tons, Japan can establish a merchant fleet equivalent to one-third of its pre-war tonnage. Currently, among the merchant ships available to Japan, 216 are undergoing major repairs or are berthed in foreign ports, and 390 are actually in operation, of which 45 are being used to repatriate Japanese residents and prisoners of war from the Asian continent and the South Sea Islands. The three major shipbuilding companies, known as the backbone of the Japanese shipbuilding industry: Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and Yamashita Kisen Kaisha, are currently still subject to the restrictions of the Allied headquarters' directive of June 6 this year. The Japanese are mostly studying the question of what kind of result the Allied nations' compensation actions will have on the future of Japanese merchant ships. It is generally believed that unless Japan is allowed to retain a reasonable number of merchant fleets and can freely navigate the world's seas, it cannot survive as a modern country.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation in Iran: Civil War Could Break Out at Any Moment. Prime Minister Sultan Naser Announces Postponement of General Election</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] British radio stations claim that a mass meeting of 50,000 people here has passed a resolution demanding that the authorities of Azerbaijan Province immediately issue a mobilization order. The radio station further stated that government troops in the city of Jinjin, near the border of Azerbaijan Province, used machine guns to strafe civilians. According to a dispatch from our Tehran office, the Azerbaijan Provincial Government has distributed weapons to workers, civil defense groups, and youth groups to defend themselves against the entry of central government troops.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 4th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultannah announced tonight that the parliamentary elections scheduled for next Friday will be postponed for one day, but the elections in Azerbaijan Province will be held only after the central government troops enter. Sultannah further stated: "The Soviet newspapers and radio stations, based on false reports from Tehran's left-wing newspapers, have launched attacks on the Iranian government, which is extremely shocking. I have always aimed to seek the friendship of the Soviet Union, knowing that good relations with the Soviets are necessary for Iran."</p>
<h3>New Anti-Malarial Drug Is Far More Effective Than Quinine</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] According to news received today: a new drug used by the U.S. military during the war to prevent and treat malaria is now available for general household use. The drug was originally named "76181," and later became known as "Chloroquine." Its effectiveness is about sixteen times that of quinine, and its toxicity is lower. The drug is also better than "Atabrine," which was widely used during the war. "Chloroquine" is a synthetic compound made from coal tar, and its chemical formula is very similar to that of quinine and Atabrine. Clinical trials are currently underway to explore whether the effectiveness of this drug can be further increased.</p>

<h3>The Mayor Convened a Press Conference to Review the Street Vendor Incident. Attending Responsible Persons Expressed Their Opinions, Eagerly Hoping the Government Will Handle the Matter Carefully.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] To review the disturbances caused by the street vendor issue the other day, Mayor Wu specially convened a press conference in the city hall conference room at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, reporting the details of the incident to the responsible persons of the city's newspapers and expressing his apologies to the press. He said that because the situation at the time was too chaotic, even news reporters were innocently injured, which he deeply regretted. The improper attitude of the police at this time must be thoroughly improved. He hoped that all sectors of society could provide as much material as possible, and the municipal government would definitely do its best.</p>
<p>As for the uproar caused by the crackdown on street vendors, all newspapers have had detailed records. In short, this incident is not simple. Because the street vendors detained by the Huangpu Police Station were all released before 12:00 noon on November 30, and there were no cases of starvation or freezing to death. However, the violent rioters took this opportunity to spread rumors and wantonly destroy property, which is extremely infuriating. I am very grateful to the military and police at the time for obeying orders and not firing live ammunition, thus avoiding a catastrophic disaster. As for the violent use of force by a few police officers at the time, it was due to the excitement of the on-site emotions, which is also human nature.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu continued, hoping that the press would pay attention to two points when reporting the truth: (1) Did it really happen? - Such as freezing to death, starving to death, police officers firing guns, etc. (2) Were the innocent citizens injured by stray bullets actually shot by police officers? Because rioters did fire guns. If any citizen can provide concrete evidence to prove that they were injured by police officers firing guns, I will definitely deal with it severely.</p>
<h3>Street Vendors Are Forced by Livelihood Needs, and They Should Be Shown Sympathy</h3>
<p>Wang Yunsheng of the Ta Kung Pao then spoke, saying: At the beginning of his term, Mayor Wu once stated in the first press conference that he had solutions for everything in the city, but he felt quite difficult about the street vendor issue. Because most of the street vendors are refugees from northern Jiangsu, and they are all forced by livelihood needs, they should be shown sympathy. However, the result of Mayor Wu's resolute crackdown at this time will inevitably cause a major disaster. On the day the disturbance occurred, our newspaper's reporter was insulted by police officers, which made him feel extremely angry when reporting the facts. However, I strongly urged him to exercise restraint in order to take the overall situation into consideration and to avoid stimulating the situation, so that the article avoided stimulation as much as possible. This is a misfortune for the country and a misfortune for the people. Therefore, the Ta Kung Pao's records of this incident are extremely mild, but my colleagues in this newspaper have a great deal of complaints about me because of this, and even believe that I am distorting the facts.</p>
<h3>Wang Yunsheng Talked About Three Points of View</h3>
<p>Afterwards, after careful review, it was believed that the attitude of the police was indeed unreasonable, and the government's</p>
<p>General style needs to be improved.</p>
<p>(1) The traditional Chinese political view is wrong. The government believes that the people must be controlled and that no one is allowed to disobey. This concept is most undesirable and may become the fuse for major turmoil. The government's attitude towards the people should not be "management" or "interference," but "help" and "service."</p>
<p>(2) The attitude of the police towards the citizens should be thoroughly improved. In this street vendor incident, the measures taken by the police against the street vendors were: "control," "scold," "arrest," and "beat"! This is the style of the patrol room in the past concession era, which is the tool used by imperialism to oppress the people of the colonies. Today, the mayor's orders or the commander's instructions cannot be regarded as laws! The police have a responsibility to protect citizens. This is true for the wealthy people in high-rise buildings, and it should also be true for the poor people sleeping on the streets, because they are all citizens!</p>
<p>After the meeting, Wang Yunsheng also hoped that the municipal government would not completely shirk the responsibility for this unfortunate incident on the rioters, and believed that the citizens arrested in the turmoil should be dealt with calmly, and hoped that Mayor Wu would leniently deal with the case.</p>
<h3>The Government Has Not Fulfilled Its Responsibility to Protect</h3>
<p>Zhan Wenhu of the Xinwen Bao said: This turmoil originated from the crackdown on street vendors, so if we want to review it, we must clarify the purpose of the crackdown on street vendors. Mayor's crackdown on street vendors in the central district is aimed at improving traffic, which is related to the welfare of the public, so I agree with it. I am extremely angry about the riots that were caused as a result, and the fact that companies and shops such as Gaosheng Department Store were destroyed in the chaos. In any case, the government's failure to fulfill its responsibility to protect should be considered a regrettable thing. I hope that the police can do more to fulfill their responsibility to protect in the future.</p>
<p>Liu Zirun of the Southeast Daily then reported his experience of being besieged and beaten by the crowd on Zhongzheng Road last Saturday. He said that although he was unconscious at the time, after he regained consciousness, he tried to avoid verbal stimulation. Regarding the issue of street vendors, he believed that it was an economic problem, and hoped that the municipal government could take a stand on the economy to find a solution. If there is no way out, it is inevitable that they will take risks. Liu finally stated that because of the disturbance that occurred this time, the municipal government should thoroughly crack down on street vendors in order to maintain the government's prestige.</p>
<h3>The Mayor Said That Although the Riot Has Subsided, the Conspirators Still Exist</h3>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu expressed his gratitude for the opinions of the above speakers, and stated that the municipal government's crackdown on street vendors in the central district was aimed at improving traffic, and definitely not at tidying up the city's appearance. In the future, street stalls will still be prohibited along the roads in the two central districts of Huangpu and Laozha, but they will be allowed to continue operating on public and private open spaces that do not obstruct traffic. He also said that although the riot has subsided, the conspirators still exist, and he will definitely step up prevention in the future, and also hope that citizens will not be incited.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Police Director Xuan Tiewu held a reception for reporters from various newspapers at the bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, reporting on the disturbances caused by the crackdown on street vendors and the handling process. He said that in recent days, the general public and public opinion have misunderstood the police bureau's measures and blamed the Huangpu Branch, but in fact, the crackdown on street vendors had already been announced by the municipal government and was implemented by the police bureau from November 1, so the cause was not complicated and the scope was not large.

Dr. Jiang Changchuan, Superintendent of the Methodist Church in North China, gave a speech on "The Mission of the Church in the New Era," believing that the power of the atomic bomb is not terrible, because it cannot overcome the world. The only thing that can overcome all difficulties and hardships is Christian love.

<p>Today's agenda is to discuss church affairs and review the gains and losses of the Christian movement over the past century, and new proposals will be submitted to the conference for discussion.</p>

<h3>"Meng Jiang Nü" to Go Abroad: New-Style Grand Opera to be Re-Performed Starting Today</h3>

<h3>Zhonghe Apartment Sales Case: Investigation into Suspected Enemy Property</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Zhonghe Apartment and the five-story Zhonghe Hospital building on Laobazi Road were originally the property of the Japanese wife of Liao Huanzhang from Taiwan. They have been sold to the Danish firm Kangyi Yanghang and are currently managed by the Korean Huang Zhimiao. On July 29th of this year, the Supervisory Yuan sent a letter to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau requesting an investigation into whether there was any collusion to conceal enemy property. According to Liao Yixiong, the son of Liao Huanzhang, the property was sold to Kangyi Yanghang in April of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) for 300 taels of gold, introduced by the broker Yan Jinfu. There is a sales contract, and the deed is the proof of ownership. However, at that time, the price of gold was 890,000 puppet currency per tael, totaling approximately 267 million yuan, while the sales contract between Liao and Yan Jinfu only stated 150 million yuan in puppet currency, which seems inconsistent. The local procuratorate is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Company Labor-Management Dispute Resolved: Labor Recognizes the Overall Situation, Management Accepts Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Three weeks ago, the workers of the Nanyang Tobacco Company put forward the following conditions: (1) Change the "daily wage system" to a monthly wage system to reward young and diligent workers. (2) Provide additional snack money for night work, also issued according to the workers' cost of living index. (3) Workers' wages should be paid as usual if the factory is shut down for boiler repairs. (4) Female workers should be given subsidies if their working hours are insufficient, to maintain their livelihoods. (5) Establish a pension system, with the amount of the pension determined by the length of service, with the highest amount being six months' salary. This labor-management negotiation lasted for nearly a month, and yesterday, an agreement was reached at the Social Affairs Bureau. The workers' opinions were largely accepted. The workers of the Nanyang Company showed great understanding of the overall situation and did not demand higher wages in the current situation of the depressed domestic tobacco industry. Therefore, the negotiations were able to proceed in a peaceful atmosphere and were easily resolved.</p>
<p>The workers of the Lehua Tobacco Factory put forward seven conditions, including: (1) Double wages should be paid for work on Sundays. (2) Holidays should be given on national memorial days, with wages paid as usual. (3) Female workers should be given 50 cigarettes per month as a reward. (4) Issuing year-end bonuses. Yesterday, during mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau, the two sides argued fiercely. The mediator believed that these demands were unlikely to be accepted. The Jiancheng Flour Mill was unable to pay workers' salaries for the second half of November due to losses. The person in charge intended to pay half of the salary first, which aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. Yesterday, representatives from both labor and management went to the Social Affairs Bureau for negotiations. However, because the official documents were not prepared and the procedures were not in compliance, the bureau ordered them to discuss it again another day.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the victory, Li Ze, the general manager of the New New Company, was jointly reported by employees, who listed crimes of collaborating with the enemy and suspected him of being a traitor. After a trial by the city's High Court, Li Ze was sentenced to three years of imprisonment on June 8th of this year. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The informant was also dissatisfied with the judgment and filed a petition on June 17th, requesting the original prosecutor to request a retrial from the Supreme Court, but the prosecutor did not consider it. The Supreme Court has now revoked the original judgment and sent it back for a new trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Ding of the High Court opened the court for investigation and summoned the original informants, Shu Yueqiao and Han Wucheng, for questioning. The audience was crowded with people, mostly employees of the New New Company and relatives and friends of Li Ze. The trial lasted from 2:40 PM to 4 PM. The court debate was adjourned to be heard again at a later date, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Numerous Cameras Flashing, Li Ze Looked Embarrassed</h3>
<p>Li Ze wore glasses yesterday, a brown striped flannel robe, and black Zhigong woolen shoes. After being escorted into the court by bailiffs, photographers immediately aimed their cameras at him. Seeing this, Li turned his head to avoid them. The photographers then separated to the left and right, each occupying a corner. Unable to avoid them, Li lowered his head to look at the ground or looked up, appearing quite embarrassed.</p>
<p>In response to the court's inquiries, he stated: "I am 43 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong. I have been working at the New New Company for 17 years. I started as deputy manager, and I have been the general manager since 1934. Before the Japanese entered the concession, they prepared to forcibly buy the New New Company. This was recorded in both Chinese and Japanese newspapers, and the New New Company also made a statement. After the Japanese army occupied the concession, the situation was not good, and unscrupulous Japanese people often came to harass us. In this situation, I discussed with the board of directors how to deal with it. Ito Masuzo, the owner of the Yiji Foreign Company, who had previously dealt with the New New Company, was consulted on how to deal with it. Later, Ito introduced the Japanese Kinoshita Yutaka, who was nominally hired as a consultant but was actually an employee, to deal with the harassment of Japanese soldiers and ruffians. This matter was approved by the board of directors. The chairman, Jin Zongcheng, testified in court when the trial first opened. Kinoshita Yutaka's monthly salary was 500 'military yen', until the first half of 1944 when he stopped coming. Regarding the puppet National Commercial Control Association, preparations began on March 15, 1943. The puppet National Defense Council and the Ministry of Industry decided on a list and appointed preparatory committee members. After receiving the letter of appointment, I was very embarrassed, because if I agreed, the government would investigate in the future, and if I did not agree, the environment would be difficult. As a result, I consulted with Huang Ruitang, a liaison officer of the Military Intelligence Bureau who often contacted the Xindu Hotel, and decided that it would be better to go along with the plan and do counter-espionage work. I first served as a preparatory committee member, then as a director, until the victory in August 1945. I don't remember exactly how many of the 33 meetings held by the Commercial Control Association I attended. However, I have never spoken or proposed a case to discuss and decide on the two unified control plans. The agency of the Commercial Control Association that handles the procedures for the entry and exit of materials was formerly the 'Military Allocation Association' run by the Japanese. It can be divided into two periods: before June 1, 1944, there was no Control Association. At that time, there were only professional committees organized by various industries. When the term of the directors and supervisors expired in June, the puppet Ministry of Industry discussed and decided to reorganize and set up control committees for rice, grain, edible oil, and other items. The chairmen of these committees were all standing members of the Commercial Control Association. Therefore, before June 1944, there was simply no work on controlling materials. After June, various control committees were established to be responsible for it. At that time, the directors' remuneration was 4,000 yuan per month for travel expenses." The court asked why he did not resign since he was forced to participate at first. Li replied: "This is not a question of resigning or not, because once you join, you have a plan and work to assist. My role as a director was completely superficial. I started working before I joined, providing information to the Military Intelligence Bureau." The court asked what kind of information it was. He replied that it was information about what the commercial association knew. Judge Yang asked: "Is there a person in charge of the Military Intelligence Bureau who can testify?" Li replied that there was, and in addition to the Military Intelligence Bureau's records, the handlers Huang Ruitang and Chen Hao could testify. At this point, the inquiry into the part about the puppet Commercial Control Association came to an end. Then he was asked about the matter of presenting the New New Company's water-heating iron pipes to the enemy in September 1944. Li replied: "This has been explained very clearly with human and material evidence in the first trial. This was not presenting iron, and it was not supplying the enemy. The New New Company's disassembled more than 200 water-heating pipes, totaling more than 20,000 catties, had been stored for several years. Because the enemy began to requisition water-heating iron, they were sold to the Senda Iron Factory in advance." The two informants who appeared in court, Xin Yueqiao and Han Wucheng, Han was a colleague of the New New Company, and Shu previously worked at the Xindu Hotel, but was dismissed for misconduct. At this point, Judge Yang instructed Li Ze to sit aside and summoned the two informants for questioning.</p>
<h3>Collecting Materials, Presenting Iron to the Enemy: Two Informants Testify on the Process</h3>
<p>Shu Yueqiao stated: "I am 37 years old, from Cixi, Zhejiang. I am currently unemployed. I started working at the New New Company in 1934, and was transferred to the Xindu Hotel in 1943. Because the small account tips were secretly distributed by the management, the colleagues were very dissatisfied and elected me as their representative to request the company to publicly distribute them. On April 15th of last year, Li Ze used the Japanese Kobayashi of the Special High Section of the puppet Lao Zha Police Branch to force me to write a letter of repentance and resign. Kinoshita Yutaka, the consultant hired by the company, was a retired naval captain who attacked Guangzhou Bay. Li Ze wanted to use this to contact the enemy puppets. The puppet Commercial Control Association was an agency for controlling materials and looting materials. Li held the position of director until the victory. The so-called sale of water-heating iron to the Senda Iron Factory is fabricated evidence, because materials were controlled at that time and transportation was prohibited. Li presented all the water-heating iron to the Japanese, who loaded it onto Japanese military trucks. Everyone in the company knew about it. Li's claims are completely sophistry."</p>
<p>Han Wucheng stated: "I am 25 years old, from Jiangyin. I am currently an employee of the New New Company and have been working for 8 years. Li hired Kinoshita to be a consultant, mainly to contact the enemy and facilitate the collection of materials. Kinoshita Yutaka had an office in Room 405 on the fourth floor of the New New Hotel. Later, he was sued for occupying the house and no longer came. Li claimed that he hired a Japanese consultant to deal with the Japanese who often came to make trouble, but why did the Da Xin and Sincere department stores not use Japanese consultants, only the New New did? The puppet Commercial Control Association was an agency that controlled materials in the occupied areas and was directly under the puppet Executive Yuan. Li's claim that he sold the water-heating pipes to Senda is completely fabricated. Shu Yueqiao has explained the matter of being forced to resign very clearly. This is a past matter, but what can be stated is that this has nothing to do with the informant's position. Of the two documents previously submitted, one was to prove the crime of the Commercial Control Association buying up gauze, and the other was a gift registry found in the New New Canned Food Department, which recorded the occasional gifts to Mei Shiping, the puppet Minister of Industry, for collusion." Yesterday, Han also added three documents to the court, which described the details of the iron presentation in detail.</p>
<h3>Li Ze Makes Another Round of Arguments</h3>
<p>The court continued to question Li Ze. Li stated: "The matter of buying up gauze was not decided by the Commercial Control Association. Wang Jingwei and the Japanese ambassador jointly issued a statement and announced the purchase method in the newspapers. I did not know about this beforehand. Afterwards, Tang Shoumin told me that Tang and Wen Lantin, out of consideration for the pain of the merchants, had negotiated several times and won back the handling of this matter by the Commercial Control Association, so that there was room for accommodation. The Commercial Control Association also set a remedial method, that is, semi-woven and woven products are not included in the purchase. Factories can keep three months' worth of raw materials, and shops can keep one month's worth. After receiving this news, I immediately notified many factories and shops, and a lot of cotton yarn and cotton cloth were able to escape. At that time, someone wrote a letter reporting Tang Shoumin, saying that I was undermining the control. If the court wants to prove it, it can ask Tang Shoumin. I did not know about the matter of sending gifts to Mei Shiping, because under the general manager, there are deputy managers and administrative directors, and I did not know about this kind of petty matter. The claim that Kinoshita Yutaka's office was located in Room 405 on the fourth floor of the New New Hotel is completely untrue. Kinoshita had an office on the fourth floor of the business building and did not come often. I do not know about the so-called criminal case of occupying a house. The reason he did not come was that after the puppet government recovered the concession, he had nothing to do and resigned from business. Regarding Shu Yueqiao's small account problem, what is said is not credible. The sale of water-heating iron pipes has been examined in detail in four joint hearings. The accountant Pan Xulun has checked the accounts of both parties and found no errors. As for serving as the chief joint guarantor of the first district of Shanghai, it was only from June 1945 until the victory, only for more than two months, and it also had a considerable effect." At this point in the inquiry, the defendant's defense lawyer submitted a document to the court, stating that the court still needs to investigate the matter of assisting in counter-espionage work, and the case was adjourned for further hearing. Li was allowed to meet with family members for a brief discussion before being escorted back to the Loyalty Jail by the police.</p>

<h3>Fabricated Charges of Treason Out of Spite; Hu Xirong Reaps a Bitter Harvest: Sentenced to Two and a Half Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Pan Youbiao, an accountant at the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil depot, was credited with protecting company assets during the city's occupation. After the victory, he was promoted to Chinese Supervisor there, managing dockworkers alongside his colleague Zhao Yuesheng. Hu Xirong, a foreman at the same company, had beaten a foreign employee of the company during the city's occupation. Consequently, he was suspended and dismissed after the victory. Harboring resentment towards Pan and Zhao, Hu reported them to the military police and other authorities, accusing them of treasonous activities. However, after investigation, the court found no evidence of treason by Pan and Zhao, and dismissed the charges. Feeling unjustly disgraced, Pan and Zhao filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Hu Xirong of making false accusations. They also included a civil suit, requesting that the court's judgment be published in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Dagong Bao, and Central Daily News for one day each, with the cost borne by the defendant. They also demanded compensation for reputational damage amounting to one yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local court pronounced its verdict. Wu Xirong, with the intent to cause others to be subjected to criminal punishment through false accusations, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of</p>
<p>two years and six months. The accompanying civil suit was granted in part, with the original judgment of this case to be published in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Dagong Bao, and Central Daily News for one day each, with the cost borne by the defendant. The request for one yuan in damages was deemed without merit and therefore rejected. Family members were sent to the Executive Yuan's relief and accommodation center.</p>
<h3>Bogus Personnel from the Korean Consulate Transferred to the High Procuratorate for Legal Handling</h3>
<p>Family members were sent to the Executive Yuan's relief and accommodation center.</p>
<p>To understand the details of the false consulate personnel escorted from Korea to Shanghai yesterday, this reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office. According to the official, "This group of false consulate personnel and their families arrived in Shanghai from Korea on the second of this month. Personnel from our office, accompanied by the police bureau, went to the Qiujiang Wharf to identify the group based on the provided list. A total of eleven false consulate personnel were identified. These included: Feng Wenxiong, Consul at the Seoul General Consulate; Huang Boqun, Vice Consul; Yang Jingquan, Additional Vice Consul; and Attaché Consuls Zhan Quanguan and Xu Zigeng; Secretaries Jiang Chunxi and Zhou Zhenbai, Attaché Consul Wang Xiaoyi at the Incheon Office; Secretary Deng Junshan, Attaché Consul Jiang Daquan at the Busan Consulate; and Secretary Chen Weide. They were escorted to the High Procuratorate for legal handling. Their twenty family members have been temporarily sheltered and provided relief by the Executive Yuan upon request from our office."</p>
<h3>Widespread Decline in Commerce and Industry; Difficulty in Job Placement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Job Placement Center of the Ministry of Social Affairs is actively strengthening job placement and guidance efforts. Plans include establishing five job placement stations in Zhabei, Yangshupu, Nanshi, the city center, and near Jing'an Temple. Academic and career training is planned for students at various schools. However, due to the widespread economic downturn in Shanghai's commerce and industry, job placement work faces significant challenges. The center places an average of just over two hundred people each month, which only accounts for one-tenth of those registered.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Recruiting Currency Counters</h3>
<p>The Central Bank is expanding its currency counting section, adding 250 temporary employees.

The dates are set for the 9th and 10th of this month, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, at the Central Bank Building at Number 24 on the Bund.</p>
<h3>Grain Loan Case Trial to Open on the 18th; Local Court to Assemble a Collegiate Bench</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The suspected offenders in the grain loan corruption case were indicted by the local prosecutor's office on the 23rd of last month and then transferred to the local court. It is reported that the case has been scheduled for trial on the 18th of this month at 9:00 AM. Given the seriousness of the case, the local court has formed a collegiate bench to hear it. It is rumored that Wu Xiangzu, the presiding judge of the criminal division, will serve as the presiding judge.</p>

<h3>Reader Inquiries Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Squatter's Rights</p>
<p>Pan Hongkui asks: I have several ancestral houses. Before the war, my mother rented out one of them without any written contract. In 1940, I wanted to take back the house for my own use, but the tenant kept delaying. Later, they even used the excuse of no written contract to refuse to move out. I ask: (1) From a legal point of view, is it legal to take back a rented house for one's own use? (2) Can a tenant stay indefinitely without a fixed-term lease? (3) Is the statement on the house rental certificate legally valid? (4) Can refusing to accept rent compel the tenant to move out? (5) If the tenant ignores my request, what should I do?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) (2) If you can prove that it is indeed for your own use, you can terminate the lease and request the tenant to move out. (3) It can be regarded as a lease agreement. (4) Refusing to accept rent during the lease period does not help. (5) You can ask the court for mediation. If mediation fails, you can sue according to law.</p>
<p>(2) Obstinate and Unruly</p>
<p>Yang Jinhua asks: My friend, Miss Jia, married Mr. Yi from the same village last April with her parents' arrangement through a matchmaker. After the marriage, she suffered various forms of abuse from Mr. Yi, causing both mental and physical harm. After being persuaded by neighbors, Mr. Yi expressed his willingness to repent, but he soon relapsed. Unable to bear it any longer, Miss Jia went to the township office and completed divorce procedures with Mr. Yi, declaring their separation. Recently, Mr. Yi suddenly went back on his word, overturned the previous agreement, and demanded 500,000 yuan in divorce compensation from Miss Jia. Now there are several legal questions, and I ask for your reply: (1) Can either party in a marriage file for divorce due to incompatibility? (2) Does Mr. Yi have any legal basis for demanding compensation from Miss Jia? Can he be charged with fraud? (3) Can Miss Jia demand alimony from Mr. Yi when filing for divorce?)</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) Since the divorce was 'resolved through the township office,' the marriage has already been dissolved. The subsequent 'living together again' is merely cohabitation, and Miss Jia can of course file for separation. (2) He can be charged with intimidation. (3) If she is not at fault, and her livelihood is endangered due to the separation, she can demand it to avoid being unable to survive suddenly.</p>

<h3>To Make Up for the Shortage of Raw Cotton for Yarn Production, the Government Decides to Purchase a Large Quantity of Foreign Cotton, to be Distributed to National and Private Yarn Factories for Use; Orders Amount to US$200 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is learned that the government is weighing the situation of domestic cotton production and procurement, as well as the amount of raw cotton needed for yarn production by national and private yarn factories. It has been decided to order a large quantity of foreign cotton to make up for the shortage of domestic yarn production raw materials. It is rumored that the amount of foreign cotton to be ordered in the first batch has been approved at US$200 million. The government is currently considering how to increase the export volume of our country's major export goods to compensate for this huge outflow of foreign exchange. In the future, after this batch of foreign cotton is imported, it will be handed over to the Cotton Control Committee for proper distribution to national and private yarn factories for use.</p>
<p>Bei Zuyi, Governor of the Central Bank and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Commission, specially convened a meeting with the persons in charge of more than ten foreign cotton import companies in this city, including Meian, Fujia, Duanji Heyi, etc., at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. He informed them of the government's original intention in ordering foreign cotton and said that with the government's implementation of the import permit system, the import of foreign cotton would also require a permit. He instructed the companies to prepare to apply immediately. The amount of foreign cotton permitted for import has not yet been decided. The amount of the import permit for each company will be properly allocated by the Distribution Office of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Commission. It is rumored that the detailed procedures for ordering foreign cotton have been entrusted by the Cotton Control Committee to the China Textile Construction Company. If the conditions of various foreign companies are not met or the quoted prices are too high, the standing committee may consider directly ordering from abroad.</p>
<h3>The Six-District Cotton Spinning Association Discusses Regulating the Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a meeting of its standing directors at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. More than ten people, including Wang Qiyu, attended. The meeting adjourned at approximately 2:00 p.m. It is reported that during yesterday's meeting, the directors presented various opinions on how to regulate the yarn and cloth market and eliminate the black market. The general suggestions included: (1) Restoring the free trading system that existed before the implementation of cotton yarn allocation. (2) The foreign exchange required to purchase foreign cotton can be offset by the foreign exchange earned from exporting yarn produced by each yarn factory. (3) The current rise in cotton prices is due to the insufficient inventory of raw cotton. Therefore, it is hoped that raw cotton can be supplied continuously, and the factories are willing to purchase it at market prices. The specific opinions are still being drafted and will be submitted to today's 15th regular meeting of the Cotton Control Committee for discussion.</p>
<h3>The Second Phase of Transporting Yarn and Cloth to the South Will Be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>The application registration date for the second phase of transporting yarn and cloth to the south was originally scheduled to begin on the 2nd of this month. However, the Cotton Control Committee determined that there was still a surplus in the number of yarn and cloth reported for transport last month, after deducting the amount exported. This surplus will now be included in the calculation for this month, so the total amount has increased. At the same time, the manufacturers who applied to participate in the southern transport last month but were rejected for insufficient documentation have now completed the necessary documents and have been approved by the Cotton Control Committee. They can also apply for transport and export starting this month. Therefore, the quantity allocation must be re-determined, so the start date of the application must be slightly delayed. It will be formally decided tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. However, the increased quantity of yarn and cloth to be transported to the south is estimated at 2,000 pieces of yarn and 35,000 bolts of cloth. Previously, in order to favor the factories participating in the joint distribution of cotton yarn, the Cotton Control Committee entrusted the Six-District Textile Association to handle the application and issuance. This month, based on the existing records, it will still be handled by the Six-District Association. The association has already sent letters to its members to start applying. The number of cotton yarn reported for transport by private factories is 1,334 pieces, and 666 pieces by national factories. The number of cotton cloth, including the surplus from last month, is 40,316 bolts, with 26,877 bolts from private factories and 13,439 bolts from national factories. All factories participating in the joint distribution of yarn can apply for export with priority.</p>
<h3>Dullness and Fatigue in the Yarn and Cloth Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was calm. The Textile Construction Company listed its prices and distributed goods to wholesalers as usual. Among the familiar goods, only 20-count "Shui Yue Cao Bao" yarn was available, still priced at 1,775,000 yuan. The prices shouted outside the market were also stable. Sales to outside provinces were very scarce because the prices in the black market in other cities were the same, leaving no room for profit.</p>
<p>The Six-District Textile Workers' Union previously decided, at a price-setting conference, that the price of the 23-count cotton yarn spun by its members should be 10% higher than the price of 20-count yarn, at 1,925,000 yuan per 400-pound piece. This has been approved by the Cotton Control Committee.</p>
<p>Sales of cotton cloth to outside provinces remained sluggish. In addition, the dyeing factories on this street had already received a sufficient amount of gray cloth, so the market transactions were mediocre, and the stalls continued to be dull and sluggish. The "Long Tou" fine cloth was still scarce, and the price remained stable. The "Wu Fu Blue Chicken" showed slight softening, and the "Four Gentlemen" piqué hovered around 110,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices of Zhejiang Tung Oil</h3>
<p>A merchant in this city received a call from Hangzhou, stating that the price of pure white oil of standard quality in Hangzhou has risen to 135,000 yuan per dan. In the Lilong area, it is 113,000 yuan per dan. In Lan, Heng, Jiang, Chun, and other places, the price ranges from 115,000 yuan to 126,000 yuan per dan. The quotation from Hankou yesterday reached around 135,000 yuan per dan. It is said that tung oil from Hankou is being shipped directly to Hong Kong, causing the price to rise sharply. Most of the tung oil exported from this city is shipped to the United States, and the price cannot be compared to the U.S. market price. However, there are very few tung oils produced and sold in Shanghai, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in this city. It is said that even merchants with strong capital only have 300 to 500 tons in stock, which is incomparable to the previous stock of 1,000 to 2,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Stable Bond Market</h3>

The scope is as large as the Sichuan Silk Company.</p>
<h3>Rampant Usury in This City; Floating Capital Concentrated; Funds Flocking from All Regions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Usury is rampant in this city, with interest rates remaining the highest in the country. As a result, funds are flocking to Shanghai from all regions to be lent out at high interest rates. Furthermore, frequent transactions in gold and securities in this city have implicitly made Shanghai a distribution center for the country's floating capital. According to statistics on domestic remittances handled by the Central Bank, the total amount of funds remitted to Shanghai from all regions each month is consistently over 200 billion yuan. It is estimated that the amount of cash brought to Shanghai by other banks and travelers from other regions is twice the total amount of domestic remittances handled by the Central Bank each month, i.e., 400 billion yuan. Compared with the amount remitted in, the amount of funds flowing out of Shanghai each month accounts for three-tenths of the total. The most common destination for funds flowing out of Shanghai is the South China region.</p>
<h3>Abundant Food Oil Supplies; Glutinous Rice and Indica Rice Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a total of over 14,000 shi arrive from the north and south. Prices in the producing areas were firm, and sales in the city were acceptable. Northern and Southern glutinous rice both rose by more than 1,000 yuan. Southern glutinous rice from the Sujia Road area was relatively scarce, so "Tongli Wujiang Liri" white glutinous rice rose strongly by 2,000 yuan. "Bi Mi" and "Bai Di Yuan Yin Yuan" were successively increased sharply. Flour mills continued to purchase as usual. Sundry brand flours were scarce, with an additional old generation of yuan added. City sales were active but not strong. Wheat remained stable and firm. Bran remained weak. Soybean cake was not concentrated in the market, and prices were mediocre. Mung beans were not available in large quantities. Nanyang slightly took over, opening up actively. Red beans remained scarce. Yellow soybeans were in low flow. Nanyang was still lazy, and the street was not refreshing. Sesame from Guangzhou was still better, and the market was stable. Recently, the oil market was flooded with supplies, especially with more tung oil from Qingdao. Supply exceeded demand, and prices continued to fall. Both raw oil and soybean oil continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil were flat.</p>
<h3>Oil Mills Re-Filling Application for Loan Amount</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Bank's provision of a 1.5 billion yuan loan to oil mills, all procedures had been drafted by the bank long ago, such as loan applications and mutual guarantees. The reason why the oil mills have been slow to apply for loan amounts is that, according to regulations, the standard is based on the monthly sales volume of the oil mills. The number of loans applied for by various factories last time did not fully match the actual sales volume of each factory, and therefore, they failed to pass the review by the municipal government. It is also learned that the Oil Pressing Industry Association, in view of this, specially sent personnel to the Municipal Bank yesterday morning to re-obtain five copies of the loan application form, carefully fill in the loan amount for each factory, and implement the loan as soon as it is approved by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Fewer Yarn Returns from the Re-Allocation Association</h3>
<p>The large number of cotton yarn return orders from the Re-Allocation Association has long been a concern for all parties. The association also believes that technical improvements are still needed. The yarn coming from the yarn factories should pay attention to practicality. It is learned that the third and fourth phases of yarn allocation have been completed. The actual allocation list for each industry and factory has been sent to the Cotton Control Committee. Among the returned orders, in addition to 20-count yarn that is suitable for use (one piece), there are 9 pieces of 6-count, 1 piece of 12-count, 547 pieces of 10-count, and 53 pieces of 40-count Texcote yarn. It is heard that the 10-count and 40-count Texcote yarn are goods that have been returned and re-allocated many times. More than 1,000 pieces of the 10-count item have been returned successively. The Re-Allocation Association believes that it is very tricky. Yesterday (the 4th), the Yarn Allocation Committee of the Six-District Cotton Textile Association held a meeting. Representatives from the Re-Allocation Association attended the meeting to discuss improvements. The cotton textile industry has agreed to make adjustments. The first allocation of the fourth phase was allocated to the member factories of each industry association yesterday. The deadline for payment this time is Friday the 5th. The member factories have expressed difficulties to their respective associations, but the associations have advised them to comply strictly to avoid being cancelled. According to the person in charge of the Re-Allocation Association, there will inevitably be a large number of yarn returns for the 60-count yarn and 40-count Texcote yarn this time. The 40-count Texcote is of poor quality and is actually waste cotton.</p>
<h3>No Significant Fluctuations in Woolens</h3>
<p>With the recent cold weather, sales of winter woolens have been good. The customers of various shops on this street are buying well. Judging from the general market situation, most of them have no significant fluctuations. They have not improved because of import registration, cancellation of orders, and rumors that foreign exchange is about to be adjusted again. The main reasons are: (1) There are an unusually large number of goods arriving. (3) There is a related relationship of high interest rates. (3) The period of actual winter sales is decreasing day by day. (4) The end of the Gregorian calendar is approaching in an instant. Both buyers and sellers do not want to store their goods, so it is expected that the woolen market will be difficult to restore to its previous peak.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Money Exchange Businesses; Total of 188 Businesses</h3>

<h3>Textile Control Committee Investigates Cotton Inventory; Limited Time for Submission May Make Timely Filing Difficult</h3>
<p>In order to understand the entire cotton inventory for reference when ordering foreign cotton, the Textile Control Committee (紡管會) has issued a cotton inventory survey form. It requires the submission of the cotton inventory as of November 30th, including goods that have been ordered but not yet received, within five days. The form is divided into five sections: (1) Type of cotton, (2) Nature (in storage or ordered but not received), (3) Quantity, (4) Storage location, (5) Remarks. All cotton inventory should also be categorized, including American cotton, Brazilian cotton, Indian cotton, Egyptian cotton, domestic American upland cotton, domestic native cotton, seed cotton, and other types of cotton. The Committee has also stipulated the following procedures for this inventory survey: (1) Each column in the form should be filled out accurately, and the forms should be collected by the trade associations and submitted to the Business Department of the Committee by December 5th. (2) The unit of quantity for raw cotton should uniformly be pounds. If sima dan (司馬擔) or shi dan (市擔) are used, they should be converted to pounds. The conversion rates are as follows: 1 sima dan = 133.33 pounds, 1 shi dan = 110.23 pounds. (3) Shaanxi cotton, Lingbao cotton, Hankou fine velvet, and Shashi fine velvet can be listed in the "Domestic American Upland Cotton" column. Tongzhou flower, Huoji flower, etc., can be listed in the "Domestic Native Cotton" column. (4) For factories within the same system, if the cotton usage is coordinated by the head office, the head office should fill out a consolidated form and attach detailed forms for each factory. (5) If the foreign exchange for ordered cotton has not been settled, it should be clearly noted in the "Remarks" column. The Textile Control Committee has printed and distributed the survey forms to textile factories and cotton merchants through their respective trade associations. Foreign cotton import firms will be directly issued the forms by the Committee. All forms are due to the Textile Control Committee today. However, according to responsible individuals from textile trade associations and others, the survey forms could only be sent to various yarn factories today and it will be difficult to complete the report on schedule.</p>

<h3>Sparse Trading on the Floor; Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last half-day of trading for the deferred delivery of Chinese stocks. There was not much trading on the floor. Both bulls and bears were preparing to compete in the fourth deferred delivery today. Therefore, superficial trading ultimately retreated as short-covering was more squeezed. It was still easy to raise it in the afternoon. Various stocks opened higher in the morning, carrying the momentum of the previous close, but due to the tightening of funds in the silver industry, there were those who took the opportunity to sell at high prices. Shortly after opening, it trended lower. Numbers 215, 224, 160, 198, and 233 were sold off one after another, gradually declining. Although there was a slight rebound midway, they continued to decline every ten minutes.

<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Loan Amount Reaches Over 2.7 Billion in Half a Month; Central Bank Says It Should Be Used to Directly Purchase Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The silk weaving industry loans undertaken by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have been in operation for two weeks since the 20th of last month. As of the previous day, the Bank of China had lent out more than 1.23 billion yuan, and the Bank of Communications had lent out more than 1.488 billion yuan.</p>

However, according to a responsible person from the Central Bank, silk weaving industry loans should be used in principle to purchase raw materials. However, it has been heard that some manufacturers who have obtained loans often do not use the loans to directly purchase raw materials, which is inappropriate. If the facts are verified, the loans will be immediately recalled.</p>
<h3>China Trust Allocates Rayon; Total of More Than 2,900 Cases</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon for the electric textile industry for this month has been approved. The number of applicants is 330, and the approved quantity is 2,996 and a half cases, an increase of 674 and a half cases compared to last month.</p>

<h3>High-Grade Goods Are Scarce and Priced Harshly; Tea Market Difficult for Foreign Firms to Activate</h3>
<p>In the tea market for foreign firms, except for high-grade aged Keemun tea, which is scarce and in short supply, sellers of other teas are generally eager to sell off their inventory. Although there is strong foreign demand for Chinese tea, those with low quality are unwanted. High-grade goods are priced extremely harshly, so transactions remain quiet, and the market lacks any distinctive characteristics. As for the uncolored Ping Shui Xin Da Bang tea, which is sold to the Americas, tea merchants in this city recently sent telegrams overseas requesting price increases, but there was no response. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for China's tea industry to become active in the international market for the time being. Internal sales of red and green tea are sluggish due to lack of investment from local shops, and there is little activity from various buyer groups. Recently, there have been frequent reports that tea sales in Tianjin are becoming increasingly stagnant, so the situation continues to be less than optimistic.</p>

<h3>Current Situation of Education in Tangshan; Municipal Education Association to be Established</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Tangshan News] Tangshan City is an important town in eastern Hebei. Except for Fushun, it is the coal production center today. The population is over 200,000. The enemy puppets have long coveted it. Since Yin Rugeng, relying on the enemy's power, established the so-called "Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government," Guangshi was the first to suffer. After the "July 7th Incident," the enemy puppets launched a two-pronged approach, destroying the old culture and implementing enslavement education in order to anesthetize children and confuse young people in order to realize their aggression dreams. Last year, the Japanese devils surrendered, and after the Communist army disturbed and destroyed it, Tangshan's education rehabilitation work could not be actively carried out. This spring, the National Army recovered eastern Hebei and cleared the Communist army. Tangshan's rehabilitation work has been mostly completed, but education rehabilitation still faces many difficulties. Primary and secondary schools, such as Provincial Tangshan Middle School, Private Fengluan Middle School, and Beiren Girls' Middle School, have already been restored, but are limited by the environment and funds, and have not been able to restore their pre-war scale. The National Tangshan Institute of Technology, which is famous throughout the country for its railway and mining, also lacks funds, so that the practice factory, the physical and chemical laboratory, and the library are still empty, and students have no way to practice or refer to them. As for Tangshan's national education, it is even more tragic. All levels of primary schools are in danger of closing at any time. Although there are no reliable statistics on the number of out-of-school children and illiterates in Tangshan City, according to private statistics, it is nearly two-thirds of the city's population. Therefore, national education is even more urgently needed. In view of this, the provincial government has specially ordered the municipal government to convene relevant people as soon as possible to establish a municipal education association to be responsible for planning education rehabilitation, eliminating illiteracy, and helping out-of-school children enroll. It is reported that the Municipal Education Association has already started work and will be established soon.</p>

<h3>United Nations to Establish an International University in the Air; British Proposal Has Been Passed</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 3rd] The Collective Transportation Subcommittee of the United Nations Cultural Education and Scientific Organization met yesterday and passed two proposals on the establishment of international broadcasting programs. One was proposed by the United States, requiring the establishment of a committee of experts to study the possibility of laying a worldwide broadcasting network.

The proposal was also passed. Cultural institutions lack funds and cannot set up radio stations on their own, as construction costs are estimated at US$200 million and annual operating expenses at US$50 million.</p>
<p>Summer School to be Established in Paris Next Year</p>

<p>After the second Educational Loan Committee of this city rushed to complete the work at the end of last month, there were still a small number of accounts that had not been settled. Although repeated reminders were issued, they could not be collected in time. The secretariat of the committee has decided to send all the receipts and expenditures of all the accounts that have been collected to the Xi Yushu Accountant's Office for auditing. After the audit is completed, a credit record will be printed and the community will be invited to a closing meeting. In addition, the funds received successively after the distribution of the loan from this session, until the end of November, amounted to more than 10 million yuan. The deposit will be transferred to the Standing Council of the Municipal Education Association for safekeeping after the end of the second session and before the start of the third session.</p>

<h3>Second Municipal Basketball League Divided into Four Groups: Men's, Women's, and Business</h3>
<h3>Full League Regulations Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>The second Shanghai Basketball League, jointly organized by the Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee and the Shanghai Stadium, is scheduled to kick off on New Year's Day next year. The league regulations have been formulated by the organizing authorities and were announced yesterday. The key points of the regulations are excerpted below: Any sports organization registered with the Sports Association may register to participate, along with a registration fee of 10,000 yuan and a security deposit of 30,000 yuan. If a team forfeits a game once, its security deposit will be confiscated; if a team forfeits twice, its membership will be revoked.</p>
<p>The number of registered players is limited to ten for each men's team and twelve for each women's team. Once registered, no additions or deletions or changes are allowed. Unregistered players may not participate in the competition. The competition rules are the 1945-1946 American basketball rules for men and the rules of the Sixth National Games for women. All league matches will be held at the Municipal Stadium on Southwest Shanxi Road. Teams that are more than five minutes late to the court (according to the clock in the stadium) will be considered to have forfeited the game. If both teams are not present, both will be considered to have forfeited.</p>
<p>Teams are divided into four groups according to their skill level: Men's A, B, Business, and Women's. All groups will use a round-robin system. If there are too many teams in a certain group, the group will be divided into sections, and then an elimination system will be used to hold inter-section finals to determine the championship. The specified playing time for each game is 41 minutes for Group A, with a ten-minute break in between, and 32 minutes for Group B and the Women's Group, with a five-minute break at halftime. Teams without uniforms, or with uniforms without numbers, may not attend the competition, but this restriction does not apply to those with special permission from the referees and recorders. If a team has a protest, it should formally submit a written protest to the secretariat within two days after the incident, and submit it to the committee for judgment. A security deposit of 30,000 yuan should be submitted with each protest. If the committee believes that the protest has sufficient reason, the security deposit will be returned; otherwise, it will be confiscated. If the team members do not agree with the committee's decision, they may appeal to the adjudication committee, and pay an additional security deposit of 50,000 yuan. The decision of the adjudication committee is final and cannot be protested.</p>

<h3>Doubts About Article 9 of the Candidate Examination Law</h3>
<h3>Examination Board Explains in Further Detail</h3>
<p>Regarding the doubts about the time limits of each clause of Article 9 of the Provincial and County Public Office Candidate Examination Law, the Examination Board has previously submitted an explanation to the Examination Yuan. Regarding (1) Article 22 of the Implementing Rules of the Provincial and County Office Candidate Examination Law states that the Examination Yuan will revoke the certificate of any person who passes the examination but is later found to have any of the circumstances listed in Article 9 of this Law. However, for clause 1 of Article 9 of the Law, "Those who are wanted by the Republic of China," if they have already been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, have served their sentence, and have been announced to have their civil rights restored, can they still apply for inspection; how should the scope of clause 3, "Those who owe public funds," and clause 4, "Those who have a record of being punished for corruption," be defined, and is it limited to those who have this situation in the county or city where they are applying for inspection. Also, who should officially announce those who owe public funds, or under what legal form should they be prohibited from applying for inspection. For clause 6, "Those who smoke opium or its substitutes," is a court judgment required, or can it be determined after investigation.</p>
<p>(3) Also, how should matters be handled if the above circumstances were not known before the exam, but the above circumstances occurred afterwards. (3) Regarding Article 22 of the Implementing Rules of the Provincial and County Office Candidate Examination Law, which stipulates that the Examination Yuan revokes its passing certificate, what is the procedure and method for revocation, and if the cause for revocation is removed, should inspection be applied for again, or should the Examination Yuan reissue the certificate.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior and the Sichuan Provincial Government sent a letter to the Examination Board for explanation, stating that "Except for the inquiry in item (2), which should be handled in accordance with Article 21 of the Implementing Rules of the Provincial and County Office Candidate Examination Law and apply the provisions of Article 17 of the Examination Law, the scope of clause 3, "Those who owe public funds," and clause 4, "Those who have a record of being punished for corruption," has been previously submitted for explanation, "public funds" should refer specifically to money and not include all public property. If public property is owed, it must be handled in accordance with the provisions of clause 4 "Those who have a record of being punished for corruption," (limited to those who have received criminal punishment, without time limit) if it has been adjudicated by a court. In the record of corruption, in addition to including all public property, it seems that money is also included. Those who owe public funds do not seem to need to be judged by a court, and can be established as long as they are found to be true. Furthermore, it seems that both of the above clauses are not limited to those who have this situation in the county or city where they are applying for inspection. As for clause 6, "Those who smoke opium or its substitutes," it does not seem necessary to be judged by a court, and can be determined after investigation." Also, regarding the procedure and method for revoking a passing certificate, it seems that this committee should submit a request to the Examination Yuan to cancel the number of the passing certificate and make it public, and when the cause of the revocation is eliminated, since its active qualifications have already been reviewed, it seems that there is no need to apply for inspection again, only need to submit documents proving that the cause of revocation has been eliminated, and submit them to this committee for verification. After verification, it is transferred to the Examination Yuan for presentation and approval," and a general letter has been sent to the provincial and municipal governments for verification.</p>

<h3>A Sad Tune on the Songhua River</h3>
<p>— A dispatch on November 24. Reporter Zhao Zhan from Shenyang</p>
<p>For one week after Chairman Chiang issued the ceasefire order, which came into effect in the Northeast at noon on November 11, the northern section of the China Chang Railway became tense again. The Communist army intended to apply the means of destroying the Beining Road to the China Chang Railway, attempting to constantly hinder traffic between Changchun and Shenyang, and assembled a force of more than 10,000 soldiers to lurk on the side of the railway between Gongzhuling and Siping. It was at this time that Zhao Jia , Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command, and his wife toured Jilin, ostensibly to inspect the Xiaofengman Power Plant. They arrived in Changchun on the 19th and went to Yongji on the 21st. Because Director Du Zhangming was summoned to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd to report on the recent military situation in the Northeast, Zhao hurriedly returned to Changchun and returned to Shenyang on the morning of the 23rd. Guo Keti, Director of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, also went to Xiaofengman, and the reporter also accompanied them on a one-day tour.</p>
<p>Scenery and People of Jilin</p>
<p>The Songhua River firmly anchors the homesickness of Northeastern travelers, tugging at the homesickness of the people of the Northeast. In the fourteen years after the September 18th Incident, she was celebrated in the mouths of Northeasterners who had fled to Guannei (inside the Pass).</p>
<p>I arrived at the Songhua River, and the Songhua River flows quietly. The gentleness of the Songhua River surpasses the beautiful scenery of the Jiangnan region.</p>
<p>Sitting on the special military train that Director Du took when he led his troops out of the Pass, I toured the scenery outside the window. Today, the traces of war are unfolded before the traveler's eyes on the Jichang Road. Every bridge and culvert is armed. The people of the Northeast do not understand why the "Eighth Route Army" wants to "dig up the road"? Why should the Chinese people go to war after victory?</p>
<p>Starting from Changchun, we enter the mountainous area in the east from the flat plains of western Jilin. The mountainous area is still east of Yongji. Along the way, there are undulating hills and sparse man-made forests. This area produces large amounts of timber and soybeans every year. In the past, forest protection and land utilization could be implemented in a planned manner. Now, the administrative efficiency in this area has been reduced. The forests are being felled, and bandits appear from time to time. I am very afraid that this free world after the restoration will return to the old appearance before the September 18th Incident and will not be able to move forward.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Yongji, it was already two o'clock in the afternoon. Those who came to welcome us at the station included Chairman Liang Huasheng, 60th Army Commander Zeng Zesheng, and 38th Division Commander Li Hong. Then, we drove to the Songhua River Guest House for a banquet hosted by Chairman Liang. The reporter thought it was a "victory meal," but after arriving, he found out that it was a "white fish banquet." (Note: Chairman Liang stipulates that new guests are to be treated with a victory meal, which only includes sorghum rice and beef. This time, it was a sumptuous banquet with white fish, a specialty of the Songhua River.)</p>
<p>Chairman Liang has his goals and firm beliefs in building a new Jilin. He said that the Communist Party had left Jilin half-paralyzed, and he wanted to build a complete Jilin. Below, I will introduce the achievements I have seen. One thing is particularly worth introducing is that Chairman Liang brought the moisture of the wartime rear. He gets up at four o'clock every day to train cadres and run schools, which is the style of young people. The party and league work is done very well, so that the people of Jilin feel that they are very close to the central government, and Jilin is moving towards a new future.</p>
<p>I would like to introduce Major General Li Hong, Commander of the 38th Division, in particular. He can be regarded as a representative of the National Army in Jilin. Li Hong's name is no stranger to those in Guannei. He was the first regimental commander of the 114th Regiment of the 38th Division to lead his troops on an expedition to Myanmar. He led the strong soldiers of Hunan from the southwest to the northeast. He is a native of Xiangyin, Hunan, and is taciturn. When the reporter talked to him, he felt that he was simple and honest, without any superficiality. He said that his brothers were unwilling to fight, but seeing how good the people of the Northeast were to them, they felt that relieving the suffering of the people of the Northeast was a responsibility. His brothers were too deeply moved by the warm love of the people. Fighting was like enduring the pain of cutting out sores. He said that he also missed his hometown very much and had not returned for several years. After listening to him, I felt that soldiers do not welcome war. Only when they need to protect something and have to draw their bayonets do they have the spirit of bravery. At the same time, the direction of the people's hearts is most closely related to the morale of the soldiers. The failure of the Communist Party in the Northeast was due to the loss of the people's hearts, which is indeed a true fact. Those who sympathize with the Communist Party feel sorry for the Communist Party.</p>
<p>After the banquet, we went to visit the Jilin Provincial Sports College, which was built with funds raised by the Dedication School Movement. It had only been open for three days and had 91 students, including 21 female students, two sports specialty classes, and one teacher training class. Chairman Liang is also the principal, and the school buildings and equipment are rarely seen in the southwest during wartime. All the students' expenses are fully borne by the school.</p>
<p>Education in Yongji City is very developed, with Jilin University and Changbai Normal College, 12 middle schools, and 30 elementary schools. The youth and children attending school account for one-tenth of the city's population of 240,000.</p>
<p>Then, we went to visit the Jilin Provincial Administrative Personnel Training Corps. Because it was getting late, we could not see the full picture of this large building. All the students gathered in the auditorium to wait for Chief of Staff Zhao to speak. Zhao was led onto the stage by Chairman Liang, and outlined the situation of the Communist army's occupation of the Northeast in the year since the victory. After he finished speaking, everyone went to the reception room to rest. Chief of Staff Zhao said to the reporter with a smile: Soldiers' speeches have a gunpowder smell, please be careful when publishing them.</p>
<p>The cadre training corps is a revolutionary furnace for administrative personnel in Jilin Province. All middle and lower-level cadres must undergo short-term training in it. There are currently 493 students, including 20 female students, indicating that women in Jilin have begun to participate in administrative work. I think the spirit of the cadre training corps lies in the couplet at the gate: "If you are a revolutionary, please come in; if you are not a revolutionary, get out."</p>
<p>After visiting the cadre training corps, Chairman Liang led the guests to the provincial government to visit his small broadcasting station. This station broadcasts programs to all parts of Jilin every day. The station call sign is XKGL, the frequency is 116XC, and the wavelength is 258.6 meters. Chairman Liang himself began to use the method of broadcasting orders, which reduced the trouble of official correspondence and increased administrative efficiency, which is a unique new approach. Chairman Liang said: "I have four broadcasting ladies." Then, he found a broadcasting lady and ordered her to broadcast a program ahead of time. This short, plump lady immediately started her program in Northeastern-accented Mandarin. Her voice became unnatural because she was in front of the chairman and many strangers. Then, Mei Lanfang's Beijing opera, mournful and desolate, was sent into my eardrums.</p>
<p>Spring in Winter</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 22nd, I was invited to Chaoyang New House to swim. It is already the dead of winter, and there is thin ice on the streets. When we arrived at Chaoyang New House, I found that the spring of Jilin was in the swimming pool built by Chairman Liang. I walked from winter into spring, and my nearsighted glasses were covered with a layer of white mist. I had to take off my glasses and jump into the pool for a swim. When I came up, the breakfast table was full of eggs and milk.</p>
<p>The highest enjoyment for civil servants in Jilin is swimming in the morning. Chairman Liang sets an example, and they go to work every morning after swimming. Chairman Liang said: This way, they have a good spirit all day. After nine o'clock, citizens can spend 50 yuan to take a bath, which is very helpful for their health.</p>
<p>Chaoyang New House was originally the Chaoyang District Office during the puppet Manchukuo period. Many people died here at the hands of Japanese police. "Chairman Liang wants to change the bloody place into an entertainment venue to change the general impression of cruelty." Zong Jun, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Provincial Government Secretariat, explained this way. It took a month from construction to completion and cost 2 million yuan in circulation coupons. This swimming pool is the first in the Northeast. Everyone who comes to Yongji likes it, but the only bad thing is that it requires four tons of coal to be burned every day. In the Northeast, where there is a shortage of coal today, it cannot but be said to be a waste.</p>
<p>The night scene in Yongji City is on Henan Road. The shops are concentrated here. The lights are brilliant in the evening, and a sense of loneliness only begins to set in after the curfew at eight o'clock. Business is very depressed, goods have no source, prices are rising, and consumption power is greatly reduced, so the general small merchants have no way out and are constantly complaining. The famous Jilin Three Treasures are not as good as the scenery of the guest houses. Good wild ginseng is very expensive, and a small one costs 90,000 circulation coupons, which is equivalent to 1 million legal currency. Sable fur is only nominally famous and is completely out of stock. The value of Ula grass has also increased tenfold compared to before, but fortunately it is not a rare item in Jilin.</p>
<p>Prices in Yongji are also constantly rising. In October, rice (per catty) was 37 yuan, millet was 13 yuan, sorghum rice was 8 yuan, an egg was 7 yuan, and firewood was 120 yuan per load. In November, the prices doubled. Rice (per catty) was 58 yuan, millet was 25 yuan, sorghum rice was 15 yuan, an egg was 17 yuan, and firewood was 200 yuan per load. The common people are overwhelmed by prices, but the lives of civil servants are better because the provincial government supplies coal, rice, and other supplies.</p>
<p>Xiaofengman Hydropower Project</p>
<p>The Xiaofengman hydropower project was originally world-famous, ranking first in Asia and fourth in the world. It originally had eight 70,000 "Ke Wei Ai" generators, with a total power generation of 350,000 "Ke Wei Ai". After August 15, the Soviet army transported away six generators, and the current power generation is only 130,000 . It is currently planning to add three 70,000 "kilovolt-ampere" generators. If this plan is implemented and the situation in the Northeast is stable, overseas transportation will not be a problem, and it can be completed within three years. 15 percent of the Fengman dam project has not been completed and requires an additional 200,000 cubic meters of concrete. If the supply of cement is sufficient, it can also be completed within three years. At the same time, the completed dam project is very sloppy. If it encounters mountain floods and heavy rains in the summer, there is a danger of collapse. The dam urgently needs to be processed.</p>
<p>The Soviet army used a lot of effort to dismantle the Fengman generators. At that time, it mobilized 2,000 Japanese prisoners and 1,500 Soviet soldiers. The work started on September 15 last year and ended on November 3, lasting a total of 40 days. Chinese workers witnessed the Soviet army dismantling their machines, and none of them were not very angry!</p>
<p>It took the Japanese nine years to build the Fengman Power Plant, and the entire completion plan required 12 years. After we take over, we need to continue to complete the Fengman project, and it is feared that it will take the same amount of time. Director Guo told the factory workers that he hoped they would stick to their posts, exert their maximum work efficiency, and contribute to the country.</p>
<p>Looking at the scenery of Jilin, Xiaofengman is also the most beautiful place. In the summer, when the water is high, the river water pouring down from a height of 100 meters forms a waterfall, swallowing clouds and spitting out fog, which is a spectacle. Now it is winter and the water has receded. Standing high on the dam, the upstream looks like a lake, and the downstream looks like a belt. The 100-meter-high dam blocks the river water, and the situation is quite spectacular. After writing about Xiaofengman, I need to add a sentence, "Fengman Power Plant" has been renamed "Songhua River Power Plant."</p>
<h3>National Father Sun Yat-sen Historical Site Memorial Hall in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— November 30th Airmail News, Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Diagonally opposite the Taipei Governor-General's Office, at the original site of the Umeyashiki Inn, formerly operated by the Japanese, now stands the</p>
<p>National Father Sun Yat-sen Historical Site Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>In the second year of the Republic of China, after the failure of the anti-Yuan revolt launched by Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai, he planned to go to Guangdong and launch another uprising, sending Huang Xing ahead to make preparations. On August 2nd, Sun Yat-sen boarded the German ship "Jock" and left Shanghai for Fujian. At this time, the situation in Guangdong took a sharp turn, so he listened to the advice of the Japanese man Toga and made a short stop in Taiwan on the Japanese ship Fushun Maru. Accompanying him were Mr. Hu Hanmin and Mr. Dai Jitao. They landed at Tamsui and arrived in Taipei, where they rested at the Umeyashiki Inn.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's stay at the inn was not long. It is said that he arrived at eleven o'clock in the morning and left at two o'clock in the afternoon. Sun Yat-sen did not like to talk much, only smiled. He did not eat much, nor did he drink alcohol. After lunch, Sun Yat-sen wielded his brush and left two pieces of calligraphy: "Comrades" and "Universal Love." One piece is preserved in the memorial hall, and the other is still in Tokyo. The inkstone he used is also treasured. After inscribing the words, Sun Yat-sen walked into the garden and had a photo taken next to a small rockery. They then set off for Keelung to board a ship leaving at four o'clock in the afternoon to visit Inukai Tsuyoshi and Toyama Mitsuru in Tokyo.</p>
<p>After Taiwan's retrocession, the owner of Umeyashiki, Fujii, presented Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy, which he had painstakingly preserved for thirty-three years, to Li Yizhong, the chairman of the provincial party headquarters, who was greatly inspired to establish the National Father Sun Yat-sen Historical Site Memorial Hall. A management committee has been organized, with Mr. Li serving as chairman, and Zhang Yanzhe, Lin Zigui, Huang Guoshu, and others as committee members. Gao Baisheng is responsible for the preparations. As Mr. Zhang Ji wrote in the "Memorial Hall Record": "In the years when Taiwan was ceded, Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause began to take shape. Now, the old objects are not lost, and the spirit is in heaven, which is truly a source of comfort and recommendation. Those who visit this hall will linger and reflect on his thoughts, so that they will be worthy of Sun Yat-sen, forever remember his cause, and glorify the nation. How close it is to fulfilling their admiration and how can it be merely a place for sightseeing?" Truly, the new Taiwan needs a deeper understanding of the Chinese revolution.</p>

<h3>A Variation on the Song of Exile</h3>
<p>Embarking on the journey home, I was not troubled by the day's fatigue. To summarize the impressions of this first trip, it can be said that it was a pleasant journey. However, there were also unpleasant things. I saw representatives of the Military Mediation Department's 33rd Group withdrawing to Yongji. The American representatives were very depressed, feeling that Chinese affairs were impossible to sort out. From the perspective of the government representatives, the withdrawal of the group was not a big deal, and the door to peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communists was not closed. However, the American representatives lost their composure, thinking that something major must have happened. However, those familiar with the internal situation in China would not be at a loss because of this.</p>
<p>Chairman Liang once directed a new play himself, entitled "On the Songhua River," which told the story of the struggle against the Communists. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to see it performed this time.</p>
<p>On the Songhua River, I heard the song of exile again, but the tune was different from before. Although it was still about painful longing, the two emotions ultimately sang two different tunes. The tune of the song of exile heard in Guannei during the war was tragic and passionate, but what I heard now was national resentment and lament. What does this illustrate? It illustrates the pain and disappointment of the people of Northeast China. Many young people who had fled from the Communist-occupied areas were still hovering on the brink of starvation, singing the sad tune of the song of exile amidst the emotional turmoil of being lovelorn with their homeland.</p>
<p>Giving a blow to those who use violence, the people of Northeast China know how to do it. The people of Northeast China hate any violence as much as they hate the Japanese.</p>
<p>When our return train passed through Yongji, we received information at the station that bandits were active at Jiutai Station. Chief of Staff Zhao ordered the station to dispatch a road roller train to proceed as usual. We returned to Changchun safely, arriving at 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Looking at America Through Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Xiao Fu</p>
<p>The world is shrinking day by day, and the relationship between China and foreign countries is becoming closer and closer, especially the relationship between China and the United States. We must study the United States and the American people in order to gain mutual understanding. After understanding, we can compare and see how they are doing and how we are doing. The best way to look at a country or a person is to start with the simple things. The truth about things in the world is not in their peculiarities, but in their commonalities. We look at this country through food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and do not indulge in talk of culture or philosophy. Moreover, clothing and food are the basis of life, and from these areas, we can see the universal and everyday life.</p>
<p>Milk and Western Food</p>
<p>Here, "Americans" still refers to the ordinary majority of Americans. They drink milk every day, and it is not expensive. In today's inflation, it costs only one dime per pound. They drink it from infancy to adulthood, even to old age. The amount of food they eat is not large, but it is very nutritious. Breakfast consists of a few pieces of buttered bread, some oatmeal, and, if better, two eggs. They do not pay much attention to lunch. Dinner is a little richer, with a few slices of meat and some vegetables per meal. For ordinary people, or the simplest way of eating, that is all. Their daily eating habits are very different from the Western food in Shanghai's Western restaurants. The Western meal in Chinese restaurants is much richer than the Western food eaten by ordinary Americans. In short, they eat for nutrition, not for taste. Moreover, ordinary people eat quite well. I do not believe that there is a big difference in Western food. The food eaten by the President of the United States will not be much better than that of ordinary workers. The best dishes are nothing more than steak, pork chops, chicken legs, and lamb chops. The characteristic is that while no one enjoys delicacies, no one eats bark, so ordinary people are very healthy.</p>
<p>Toilet Facilities</p>
<p>All toilets in the United States are flush toilets. Clean toilet water makes it less likely for people to get sick, thereby raising the health standards of the nation. Here is an example of the toilet facilities in an ordinary school to give an idea of the rest. In the place for urination, there are urinals, some of which automatically flush every few minutes. Some use people to press the faucet. Tap water, like in China before the war, flows very smoothly. The place for defecation is mostly chamber pots. As a rule, there is white, soft toilet paper. The lids of the chamber pots are afraid of transmitting skin diseases, so another kind of paper is prepared, the size of which is consistent with the wooden lid of the chamber pot, and it is placed on top during defecation and thrown into the chamber pot after use, flowing down the drain. In the restroom, there are washbasins and paper for drying hands. The quality is very good, and it is very large. Wash your hands after defecation. Use paper to wipe your hands. Paper is better than public towels. From this matter, it can be determined that there are so many kinds of diseases that can be prevented because of this.</p>
<p>Hygiene and Nutrition</p>
<p>During World War II, less than one and a half American soldiers per thousand died from disease. It can be seen that they pay special attention to hygiene, even in the wild battle zones, and do not treat human life as child's play, let alone in schools?</p>
<p>The people are the foundation of the country, and the population is the treasure of the country. Life must be cherished. China is proud of its large population, which shows that it recognizes the importance of population. Since it knows the importance of population, why is it so negligent in nutrition and hygiene? During the War of Resistance, the insufficient nutrition of students was pointed out as national suicide. Now, after victory, not only must the nutrition of students be increased, but also the nutrition of the general population. Some say that Chinese disaster victims eat tree bark, so what is there to talk about nutrition? However, this is a morbid state. Are we just watching a nation decline day by day?</p>
<p>Sleeping Comfortably</p>
<p>When it comes to sleeping, "Simmons" mattresses are the enjoyment of special and very special people in China, but in the United States, although I dare not say that everyone has them, it is probably common. The so-called poor people in the United States also have such a bed. They also have a shower room, take a hot shower at night, and sleep comfortably. According to medical experts, sleeping on a soft bed for six hours is equivalent to sleeping on a hard bed for eight hours. If you have a good night's sleep at night, you can do more work in the morning. How can work be efficient if you do not get enough sleep? This point cannot be asked of China; it can only be said.</p>
<p>In short, the purpose of this article is to let readers know what kind of life ordinary Americans live and how ordinary Chinese people are struggling in dire straits. We are catching up quickly, increasing production, but we cannot catch up for a while. How can we withstand internal strife again?</p>

<h3>On Reading the First Draft of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted"</h3>
<p>— Yao Shennong</p>
<p>Personally revised by Chairman Chiang, translated by Wu Jingxiong. First edition published by Commercial Press in October 1946, the entire book is 212 pages, the actual price is 2100 yuan.</p>
<p>"The Book of Psalms" is not only a hymnbook of Christianity; it is an immortal masterpiece in the literary heritage of mankind. Its value has long transcended the scope of religion and has deeply permeated the entirety of culture. The breadth and length of its influence can rarely be compared with it in ancient and modern literature. Therefore, we feel that the publication of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted, First Draft" is a major event in the cultural world and also a milestone in the relay station of Sino-Western culture.</p>
<p>Why is "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted, First Draft" worthy of such attention? Hasn't the Book of Psalms already been translated into Chinese? That's right, there are already Chinese translations—classical Chinese, Mandarin, dialects—there are many different versions. However, their translations all adhere strictly to the standards of the original text, and only "faithfulness" and "expressiveness" are achieved in the three words "faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance," while "elegance" is difficult to achieve. Archbishop Yu Bin said in the preface to this book: "Our country's translations are all awkward and difficult to read, making people feel disgusted." We think that anyone who has read the Chinese translation of the Bible probably has the same feeling. The Bible translation has been circulating in China for a long time, but it has not had a significant impact on literature, and the reason lies in this. We know that the original text of the Book of Psalms is a gem of ancient Israelite national literature, and the translations in various languages of Christian countries are also elegant and magnificent, occupying a lofty position in their literature, just like our Book of Songs. If we compare the existing Chinese translation of the Book of Psalms with the original text or European translations, we cannot help but feel too shabby and inferior. All we have is the dregs of the Book of Psalms, and we have not obtained the spirit of the Book of Psalms. What a great defect this should be!</p>
<p>"The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted, First Draft" is obviously made to fill this defect. What the translator pursues is the spirit of the Book of Psalms, not the shell of the Book of Psalms. In these one hundred and fifty translated words, we cannot find forced or awkward words and phrases, or raw or unintegrated meanings of the scriptures. When we recite them, we seem to be reading an ancient poetry collection of a mountainous country, and we do not feel that this is a translation of the Israelite Book of Psalms. This alone is beyond the reach of those who wield their pens casually.</p>
<p>This translation method cannot be compared with literal translation. I personally have no bias towards either literal translation or free translation. I think that the translation method should be based on the nature of the original text. If the original text is substantial, then literal translation is of course more accurate. If the original text is spiritual, then only free translation can achieve the wonder of "conveying the spirit." The Book of Psalms is undoubtedly a work belonging to the latter category. Mr. Wu resolutely transcends the limitations of words and soars in the realm of the mysterious and ethereal. This is completely in accordance with the internal needs of the Book of Psalms and is not deliberately showing off the translator's talent for writing ancient poetry.</p>
<p>The most difficult realm to achieve in free translation is "obtaining its spirit," and this is especially true when translating ancient works. Because in addition to spirit, the work also has a "style" that is inseparable from the spirit. The literature of an era has the style of an era, just as the Zhou Ding and Shang 　each have their representative characteristics of an era. The Book of Psalms was created from Moses in the 16th century BC to Malachi in the 5th century BC, lasting for more than a thousand years. Its era is equivalent to the Shang and Zhou dynasties in our country, and its ancient and simple language can only be compared with the poetry and diction above the Han and Wei dynasties. I think that before Mr. Wu took up his pen, he probably made a careful consideration of the style of the translated words, so the entire draft generally adopted the style above the Han and Wei dynasties. For example, the one hundred and nineteenth poem, known as the "Song of Songs of the Book of Psalms," verses 1 to 8:</p>
<p>"Happy is the gentleman, with a pure heart and innocent conduct, following the holy way, cautiously and diligently, leisurely and contentedly, following the Lord's rules, being precise and unified, without duality or error, the holy commandments are clear, how dare to abandon them, I pray that the Lord will guide me, to piously abide by the great law, so that I will be free of shame, the golden rules and jade precepts, so that I can joyfully sing, the Lord's spirit, with a righteous heart and sincere intentions, only the Lord is the model, only asking my Lord, not to abandon me."</p>
<p>Another example is the eighteenth poem, verses 7 to 13:</p>
<p>"The Lord's anger shakes the universe, the earth trembles, and the mountains collapse, smoke rises from the nose, fire spews from the mouth, sand and stones melt, and vegetation burns, the sky curtains hang down, and the Lord personally descends, with dark clouds under his feet, riding a divine steed and galloping, soaring on the wings of the wind, covering himself with heavy darkness as a curtain, and using it as a palace, yin and yang combine to form hail, and red smoke rises from the clouds, showing the majesty of the Most High, and shaking the sky with thunder."</p>
<p>If we compare the above-quoted translation with the original work, the reader can know that Mr. Wu has spent a lot of effort on style. If, when reciting it, the reader feels that the ancient and simple words of the original work are reflected between the lines, then it is enough to illustrate the abundance of the harvest obtained by the translator's painstaking efforts. The praise on the pen seems humble.</p>
<p>Comparing the Translation with the Original Work, Painstaking Efforts Are Fully Revealed</p>
<p>Style and spirit are qualities that are interdependent. Having style but no spirit is like a high sail but no wind, unable to see the use of the sail. Since Mr. Wu has achieved the above-mentioned accomplishments in style, let us examine again: does he also have equal achievements in spirit? If we temporarily compare verses 7 to 13 of the eighteenth poem of the Book of Psalms, which we quoted earlier, with the English translation and the popular Mandarin translation, we find that the popular translation is like this:</p>
<p>"Then the earth shook and trembled because of his anger, and the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook. Smoke rose from his nostrils, and fire burned from his mouth, even coals were kindled. He also made the heavens droop and descended himself, with dark clouds under his feet. He rode on the cherub and flew; he flew swiftly on the wings of the wind. He made darkness his hiding place, with the darkness of water, thick clouds of the sky, as his surrounding palace. Because of the glory before him, his thick clouds passed by with hail and burning coals. The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, and there was hail and burning coals."</p>
<p>According to the records of the Old Testament, this poem is a song of praise written by King David in memory of God's protection and care when he struggled with enemies and Saul in the past. Its temperament is most similar to Lisao in ancient Chinese literature, because they are both the offspring of poets' fantasies. Translating this type of work, if you only seek the faithfulness of the literal meaning and ignore the spirit of the original work, it is like cutting off the wings of the celestial horse and teaching it to drive in the mill! The Mandarin translation quoted above commits this problem. When we read it, we only see a lot of unbelievable absurdities, and we do not have an ethereal feeling. Conversely, when we read Lisao, we do not feel its exaggeration at all, we only feel like we are riding the wind, floating to a detached realm. Mr. Wu chose the style of Lisao to translate this psalm. We feel that it is the most appropriate choice. He not only maintained the ancient and solemn nature of the original work, but also maintained the unrestrained spirit of the original work. If you are not familiar with the Bible and ancient Chinese poetry and diction, such a competent and pleasant translation is impossible.</p>
<p>Abundant References, Worthy of a Masterpiece</p>
<p>The most commendable achievement of the first draft of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted" is of course "obtaining its spirit," but its precision is also beyond the reach of the non-circulating Chinese translations. Mr. Wu tells us at the end of the volume that his translation is mostly based on Swete's "English Translation of Psalms and Hymns." Because I have a teacher-student relationship with Mr. Wu, I learned that he referred to many classics, and for the sake of prudence, he repeatedly studied with Chinese and Western scholars who were proficient in scripture and revised each draft verse by verse with the Hebrew original, correcting many defects in the English and Chinese translations. Due to space limitations, I will only cite the first verse of the first poem of the Book of Psalms to see a glimpse:</p>
<p>"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night." (Mandarin)</p>
<p>"Not following the advice of the wicked, not following the path of sinners, not dwelling in the seat of scoffers, blessings descend. Taking pleasure in the law of Jehovah, thinking of it and maintaining it, day and night." (Classical Chinese) The first draft of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted" is:</p>
<p>"Long is the happiness of the gentleman, for good deeds bring together a hundred blessings, do not associate with those without disasters, be ashamed to stand with the lowly, avoid those who are frivolous and slow, disdaining to sit with them in the same seat, leisurely swimming in the holy way, soaking in it from morning till night."</p>
<p>Regarding these short two verses, Mr. Wu will put forward three arguable meanings in the footnotes. (1) The "hundred blessings" he translated, the Hebrew original text is plural, meaning that all kinds of blessings are available, the English translation is Blesseo, and the Chinese translation is "blessed" or "blessings," which all fail to include the meaning of the original text. (2) The Law in the English translation is generally translated as law in the Chinese translation, but according to the research of scholars of scripture, the original text actually encompasses the entire holy way, so Mr. Wu decided to translate it as "holy way." (3) The "soaking" he translated has the meaning of thinking about it and maintaining it, reciting it verbally and maintaining it mentally, and the English translation is Meditate, and the Chinese translation is "thinking" or "thinking," which cannot fully express the original meaning. Another example is the famous sentence at the beginning of the twenty-second poem: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? (This is the sentence that Jesus cried out when he was dying.) The Hebrew original is "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" There are a total of ten syllables. Mr. Wu translated it as: "Lord, Lord, why have you abandoned me like an inheritance?" The ten syllables of the ten characters coincide with the original text, and David's melancholy and sorrowful complaint are as if heard. The old Chinese translation is: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" or "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?" Compared with Mr. Wu's translation, there is a real difference between those above the clouds and those on the ground.</p>
<p>Such examples can be found in almost any translated interpretation of the Book of Psalms, and I do not need to list them one by one. Mr. Wu deliberately pondered the style and spirit, sparing no effort, and at the same time, he can still be so meticulous in the meaning of the scriptures, striving for excellence. Apart from deeply rejoicing for the Book of Psalms, what else can we say?</p>
<p>However, Mr. Wu himself does not feel satisfied. Although it has gone through two years of deliberation and revision and three revisions by Chairman Chiang, he still refuses to admit that his work has been completed. He believes that this is only the first draft of the translation and interpretation and hopes to obtain the corrections of literary and academic circles at home and abroad after publication. This humble attitude is not only a footnote to the translator's scholarship and accomplishment but also a sign that the first draft of the translation and interpretation has been tempered thousands of times. This alone is enough to illustrate the value of this book, and we hereby extend our most sincere recommendation to readers.</p>

<h3>John Christopher (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jia Shui</p>
<p>(1) The Novel's Form, the Epic's Content</p>
<p>"John Christopher" is divided into ten volumes, translated into four thick books in Chinese, totaling 2,350 pages, approximately one million words. The above attempt to summarize the story in less than one four-hundredth of the original word count is inevitably flawed. Moreover, the book's merit lies not merely in its plot. The translator states:</p>
<p>"John Christopher" is not just a novel—it should be said to be more than just a novel, but a great epic of humanity. It depicts and celebrates not humanity's material adventures, but its spiritual struggles, not the conquest of the external world but the conquest of the inner world. It is a mirror to millions of lives, an adventure story of heroes and sages from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, a symphony in the style of Beethoven. (Volume 1, Translator's Dedication)</p>
<p>The author himself said:</p>
<p>I never intended to write a novel: this is obvious. What, then, is this work? A poem? Why must it have a name? When you see a person, do you ask if he is a novel or a poem? What I have created is a person. (Volume 3, Volume 7, Preface to the first edition) Therefore, we are not reading a novel, but a person. We are witnessing the growth of a genius soul and the many hardships it must endure.</p>
<p>We see Christopher's work. From childhood, "like all children, he hummed all day long," with his grandfather recording his best tunes, to later, after experiencing much labor, joy, and setbacks, he finally reached this state:</p>
<p>Christopher, abandoning his art, was astonished to feel rising within him an unnamed power, which he had not expected: neither his passion, nor his sorrow, nor his conscious soul... but a strange soul, indifferent to all that he loved and suffered, indifferent to his whole life, a joyful, sacred, wild, and inexplicable soul! It spurred him on like a steed, kicking his flanks with its spurs. Often when he had a moment to breathe, he would reread what he had written and ask himself:</p>
<p>--How, how did these come from me? (Page 2088)</p>
<p>We also see Christopher's friendships. From his earliest friends, his grandfather Johann Michael and his uncle Gottfried, to his later young friends, Aymery and Georges, there are many figures with varying degrees of closeness, goodness, and evil. But the closest and most influential of all was Olivier. After their first meeting, Christopher repeatedly said: "I have a friend."</p>
<p>I have a friend! He is far from me, yet close as a neighbor, forever in my heart. I have possessed him, he has possessed me. My friend loves me. "Love" has merged our two souls into one. (Page 1342) When Olivier died, Christopher's only thought was to be buried with "him," to end with him.</p>
<p>The suffering of the world is that a person almost never has a companion. Perhaps some partners, some chance encounters. The beautiful term "friend" is abused. In reality, a person can only have one friend in a lifetime. And even that is a happiness that few can enjoy. But this happiness is so wonderful that a person simply cannot live without it once it is lost. (Page 1959)</p>
<p>(2) Differing Views on the Worthiness of Women</p>
<p>We also see Christopher's loves, his girlfriends, because he never married. In this regard, I find two things quite peculiar about this book. One is that although there are pure Antoinette, serene Grazia, and other women, none of them possess extraordinary talent to match Christopher's. Compared to them, the women in "Dream of the Red Chamber" are much more outstanding. But the male protagonist in "Dream of the Red Chamber" seems so pitiful: what Baoyu lacks is precisely what Christopher has in abundance—vitality. "Dream of the Red Chamber" goes from something to nothing, "John Christopher" from nothing to something; one is passive, the other active.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity is that almost none of the women associated with Christopher have happy endings. Pina, Antoinette, Françoise, and Grazia all died. Although not due to Christopher's fault; but if they, especially Grazia, had never met him, then perhaps they would have lived longer, albeit more uneventfully. But, who knows? Maybe they preferred it this way. The fullness and brilliance of life are not measured by its length. Then there's Anna, even more pitiable. The relationship between her and Christopher, "that was not love, that was madness." Christopher went mad, walked away, and recovered; Anna went mad, and remained mad to the end. What was her inner life like? In comparison, perhaps those who died were happier. I say this not to criticize Christopher, but to admire the book's honesty.</p>
<p>It is often seen that in love, the weaker of the two gives the most, not because the other loves less; but because he is stronger, so he should take more. (Page 2141)</p>
<p>We also see Christopher's thoughts. The author has the protagonist grow up in Germany, spend an important part of his life in France, and end his days in Italy; he speaks of this person, and also of these countries. Therefore, this book is as weighty in quality as it is in quantity, because it is not just a portrait, but also a</p>
<p>huge historical painting—not only realistic, but also symbolic, containing prophetic meaning. The author uses the entire intellectual, social, political, national, and artistic history of the late 19th century as the background for this new hero. (Volume 2, Translator's Preface)</p>
<p>Although the translator wrote a preface at the beginning of the second volume and countless small notes throughout the book, readers like me still find many parts of the book obscure and difficult to understand. But I am therefore willing to reread this book in three or five years to see if my understanding of it has increased, and thus gauge whether I have made any progress myself.</p>
<p>(3) Difficult to Depart from Tradition: This Book is Christian</p>
<p>But one thing I seem to understand now is that this book is ultimately Christian, in the broadest sense of the word. After experiencing much.</p>
<p>Thus Christopher understood old Halton's wisdom, that every morning, before writing, he should kneel... "Watch and pray." Pray to God, asking him to be with you. Communicate with the spirit of life with piety and love. (Page 2090)</p>
<p>On page 2289, there is a reference to the passage in the "Gospel" where Mary Magdalene encounters the gardener. The translator did not add a note, which I think is a pity, because this passage is very interesting, and it is mentioned again four pages later, and even includes some dialogue. According to that passage in the "New Testament," "Gospel of John," Mary Magdalene, in general Chinese translations, is called Mary of Magdala, from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons. (According to our present view, she should be a talented and sharp-edged woman with mental disorder, and Jesus healed her mental disorder.) The first person Jesus saw after his resurrection was her, and she initially thought Jesus was the gardener. In this book, Christopher, after receiving the news of Grazia's death, drew his own strength from this passage. Is believing in resurrection superstition? Romain Rolland made Christopher believe in resurrection.</p>
<p>This is a huge work, of indescribable length, breadth, height, and depth. Not to mention the author's genius, the translator's erudition and hard work deserve the gratitude of those of us who do not understand French but wish to read this book.</p>
<p>The day you see Christopher's face is the day you will die but not die from misfortune. (Latin inscription under the statue of Saint Christopher in front of an old church door)</p>
<p>The long night is long, but it will eventually reach the end. The free souls of all countries who suffer and struggle will finally reach the other shore, welcoming the dawn and peace.</p>

<h3>From the 155th Anniversary of Mozart's Birth: On Testing Musical Genius</h3>
<p>— Liang You Ting</p>
<p>If one asks, "Who is greater, Beethoven or Mozart?" that is a very foolish question. However, in fact, the general public is more familiar with Beethoven and neglects the supremely talented musical prodigy, Mozart.</p>
<p>Why say he was a prodigy? Because he indeed began learning the harpsichord at the age of three, could play waltzes in triple time and began composing fragments of music at the age of four, and performed publicly at the age of five; therefore, although he died young at the age of thirty-five, in those thirty years, his life was completely devoted to music, his works, his voice, representing his spirit and living forever.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people doubt: saying that he composed at the age of four sounds like a myth, and is probably an exaggeration. In fact, regarding Mozart's historical details, many historical books can prove that it is not a fabrication. The authoritative music forum, Paul Bekker's "The Story of Music," also has an unparalleled admiration for Mozart. He said: "Although there have been many musical prodigies throughout history, in any aspect, Mozart's talent is by no means something that ordinary musical prodigies can hope to match." The Encyclopedia Britannica also uses several pages to detail Mozart's life, with almost every year's activities recorded. It also says that Mozart composed at the age of four. (Note: The Western custom of four years old is four full years)</p>
<p>For all art, the factors for success are nothing more than talent and hard work. Mozart's success, although attributed to the proper education by his father (a famous violinist at the time), is mainly due to his rare talent.</p>
<p>Today, on the 155th anniversary of Mozart's birth, as we remember the "divine talent" of the musical sage, we first think of an issue of our own: the wasting of musical talent in China, and the waste of music education.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out that people's musical "innate talent" is unrelated to musical training. This is the result of modern musical education's testing. A junior music school uses the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability to measure a child's sensitivity to music, and sometimes finds one or two children who have not received considerable musical training before the test, but during the test can distinguish very well the pitch of scales, the size of volume, and the strength of tones, etc. For the same reason, if a child has received rigorous training, but he has no talent, then his performance in front of the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability will still be poor.</p>
<p>Therefore, although China has always had a very low level of music and music education is not widespread, in a population of ten thousand people, who knows if there is not an innate talent like Mozart? Or a prodigy similar to Mozart?</p>
<p>However, our musical talents are not easily discovered, nor will they be valued, let alone cultivated. Music schools are not necessarily full of geniuses, and true geniuses are often misled by their parents or by society. Furthermore, how many people can receive the baptism of music education from the age of three, like Mozart?</p>
<p>Therefore, many talents are wasted, and many people who are not suitable for becoming music experts are sent to specialized schools, wasting themselves and wasting the public.</p>
<p>My statement is not to say that music must be exclusive to "geniuses," but to say that people with low musical sensitivity can just entertain themselves with music or appreciate others' performances, and do not need to engage in the hard training of music experts. Because that would be futile.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability are already widely used. There was once an eleven-year-old child who was singled out from the crowd. His family was poor, but his talent was outstanding. After testing, he received learning opportunities. Later, when he graduated from music school, he received four scholarships; at the age of twenty, he was the conductor of a symphony orchestra. There is also the fact that an elderly mother in her sixties hoped that her daughter would become a pianist, but she studied hard for two thousand hours of piano but still had little success; after testing, it was proved that her talent was too poor. Therefore, she happily gave up the hard practice of piano and became a shop clerk.</p>
<p>The famous American baritone Lawrence Tibbett was also tested, and the result, as expected, was that he was one of the top 3%.</p>
<p>From commemorating the musical prodigy Mozart, to thinking about the cultivation of musical talent, and then to thinking about China's music education, I really don't know where to begin.</p>
<p>Parents rarely discover their children's artistic talents, and even if they do, they rarely agree to let them study music, because music will not lead to success. However, the achievement of music must be due to hard practice from an early age, and it must be talent.</p>
<p>The establishment of the National Conservatory of Music's junior class is said to be in response to this; they also use the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability. However, there are too few parents who are willing to send their children to the junior class to study music for life; this is the fatal flaw of the junior music class, and also the fatal flaw of Chinese music!</p>
<p>We commemorate Mozart with deep sorrow, and we also look forward to the road ahead for our own music education with deep sorrow.</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>It was already dark, and the rain had not stopped. I had been cooped up in the house all day and felt really bored. It was impossible to find someone to talk to, and there was nowhere to go for a walk. When I tried reading, I forgot the beginning after reading the end; when I tried writing, I couldn't write anything at all. Loneliness and solitude stole into my heart like thieves, making me feel infinitely troubled.</p>
<p>I seemed to see her shadow flickering before my eyes, and the words she had said rang in my ears again. It was really ghostly! Why did her shadow stick to my brain like a thin film?</p>
<p>Impatiently, I got up, found an empty bottle in the corner of the room, picked up my umbrella, and went out to buy a bottle of wine and a packet of peanuts. When I came back and poured the wine into a glass, I only thought: I'll just get half-drunk and go to sleep. Who knew, this devilish thing called wine often controls a person's will, it tempts you like a demon, making you drink until you're completely drunk.</p>
<p>After drinking the wine, my head swelled, my heart burned, the whites of my eyes turned red, and the infinite sorrow in my chest had to be vented to feel better, otherwise, I wanted to find someone to fight to feel relieved!</p>
<p>I could no longer control myself, and disregarding everything, I rushed out of the door, soaking in the rain, aimlessly walking down the street, my weak eyes half-open and half-closed, staggering, mumbling something. Her moon-like face, star-like eyes, and youthfully vibrant and seductive body were always flashing before me. Her smiling glance back and her delicate voice were always jumping in my memory. This gentle and kind girl gave me infinite joy and happiness, but also brought pain and trouble.</p>
<p>I finished walking one street, turned the corner, and walked down the second. The rain was still falling, there were few pedestrians, and there were hardly any cars. I boldly staggered in the middle of the road, the rainwater dripped down my collar into my back, feeling cool and comfortable. Suddenly, a car screeched to a halt behind me, and the driver stuck his head out and cursed: "Pig! Are you looking to die?"</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, just gave him a contemptuous grimace, and walked towards the side of the road. But he didn't let go of this opportunity to curse. "If you want to die, go jump into the Huangpu River!"</p>
<p>I didn't take it to heart and continued walking forward. Before long, I stopped on the sidewalk at the intersection, leaning against a triangular telephone pole. I felt thirsty and wanted to drink water, but there was no way. A trolleybus suddenly stopped beside me, the lights inside shining on me, and several people got out of the car. It was only then that I realized I was standing there. She was smiling and walking towards me from over there. I excitedly went up to greet her and shake her hand, but suddenly she disappeared! Disappointed, I looked around, cursing angrily: Ghost!</p>
<p>The trolleybus also turned the corner and left.</p>
<p>I walked into the third street, the streetlights only emitted a dim and weak light, the street was still dark, and people walking towards me could not be seen. I was thirsty and also starting to feel tired, leaning against a crooked tree to rest, my eyes slowly closing, my legs unable to support my whole body; so I hugged this sycamore tree to keep myself standing. It was only then that I realized that I was standing opposite her house. I saw lights shining from the house upstairs, and I thought: maybe they can give me a glass of water to drink, no, it's better to look up and beg God! I raised my head and opened my mouth, letting the rainwater drip into my mouth. A sycamore leaf was knocked down by the water, so I picked it up and sucked the rainwater on it with my mouth, although the amount was so small, it gave me a refreshing feeling.</p>
<p>The lights in the building across the street grew brighter, and shadows were moving. Who knows that in this modern building, there are still some remnants of feudalism! She is a member of this family, but she has no freedom of personal action, everything must be in accordance with the family's will, and the family's representative is her own widowed mother.</p>
<p>Last Christmas, her mother tied one of her legs with a rope? She had therefore drunk wine once and walked into a dance hall she had always hated, preparing to endure the fate bestowed by God - a path of a virtuous wife and good mother!</p>
<p>I thought of what a friend had said to me: Catholics are the most conservative, and their rules are the strictest, they will never marry non-Catholics!</p>
<p>I shuddered!</p>
<p>Rainwater dripped from my hair onto my face, my coat was soaked and had seeped into my underwear, and my trouser legs were stuck to my legs and were so heavy. I leaned against the tree, the tree knots pricking me, so I moved to the triangular cement pole two steps away from the tree to lean against.</p>
<p>Past events flashed through my mind like a dream, she had been drawn into this dream by me, and when the dream cleared, everything was forgotten. But this is not a dream, it is a fact!</p>
<p>The night was already very late! I stopped a passing car, I couldn't remember if I said anything to him. Because when I woke up, I was already lying in bed, the quilt and mattress were soaked, I changed my clothes as if I had come out of the river, I felt my head was too heavy to support, so I slept for a day.</p>
<p>Although I hate her a little, it also makes me miss her more!</p>
<p>The rainy night has long passed. But the emotion of longing still exists, the same as in the rainy night.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>— Raphael</p>
<p>Raphael (Raphael Sanzio 1483-1520) was also a great master of the Italian Renaissance, but unfortunately he died young and left fewer works behind. His works are not as rigid as Michelangelo's, nor as mysterious as da Vinci's, but possess a full and beautiful charm.</p>

<h3>A Short Biography of the Musical Prodigy Mozart</h3>
<p>— Hong Zanying</p>
<p>The German composer Mozart has always been known as a "musical prodigy," with unsurpassed genius and a magnificent spirit in his works. Some say he was Austrian, but in fact he was from Salzburg, a city in southern Germany, and later moved to Vienna; Vienna was then the world's musical capital, and musicians gathered here.</p>
<p>Mozart was born on January 27, 1756. His father was a talented violinist who served in a monastery. When Mozart was three years old, he studied piano with his sister. He was gifted and intelligent, and at the age of six he traveled with his father and sister to perform in various places. The two young siblings sat in front of the piano, skillfully playing with their small arms, and all who listened were amazed.</p>
<p>Mozart has a very famous anecdote: Once, he was performing in front of the Austrian Emperor. After the performance, he actually sat on the Queen's lap, kissed her neck, and pointed to the Princess, saying, "I want to marry her." This shows his passionate and unrestrained nature, which he had from a young age.</p>
<p>Mozart's works cover all departments, vocal music, instrumental music, symphonies, and religious music all have brilliant expressions. His symphonies are as famous as Beethoven's. Some people may think that Mozart's works are not easy to accept, but in fact his works are the most revolutionary. Paul Bekker said that he was "the first person to risk his life for freedom. His personality and thoughts are expressed in his works."</p>
<p>I believe that "high art is often lonely," is inevitable, and this has not affected the lasting value of Mozart's works in musical history.</p>
<p>Poverty and unrequited love plagued Mozart. In terms of his contribution to music, he was successful, he dedicated his entire life, but for him personally, he was traveling everywhere after the age of six, and as a result, he died at the age of only thirty-five from cold. He passed away on December 5, 1791 (that is, today, 155 years ago), and his soul returned to heaven amidst worldwide mourning.</p>
<p>May Mozart be aware of our distant memorial to him in heaven!</p>
<h3>Happy to Meet the Layman Daqian on the Sea and Receive a Poem as a Gift</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xin</p>
<p>Ten years ago, we parted at Wumen, and today we meet on the sea. There are more new peaks under your wrist, and in your eyes there is no old pavilion; the princes share a common taste (Xin Yu has also recently come to Shanghai), the disciples follow you are also extraordinary talents (Yu Shengming has recently joined your school); I beg for a corner of your Yellow Mountain, and I hope to be able to compensate for the ashes left by the calamity. (You once painted a picture of Yellow Mountain for me and wrote a long postscript to record it, which was burned in the fire during the war, and I regret it to this day.)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 113</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>However, upon further reflection, it didn't feel right. Even if Pingzi was naughty, he wouldn't play a prank to this extent. The small piece of paper must contain important news, or secrets related to me personally. Thinking of this, I carefully hid the small piece of paper again. Just after taking a couple of puffs of cigarette, a thought suddenly struck me. I immediately tore off a blank page from my notebook. Looking around, I saw a beautifully written Mi Fu style calligraphy on a hanging scroll on the wall. The words were Li Houzhu's little poem, "When will the spring flowers and autumn moon end? How much do we know of past events..." I changed my handwriting, and casually used the school's propelling pencil to write on the blank page, "Spring flowers and autumn moon are spent casually, you know how much of the past."</p>
<p>Just as He Jian finished writing and folding it, he suddenly heard a faint sound of footsteps outside the door. He quickly hid the written slip in the cigarette case, put the cigarette case in his pocket, and put the notebook and pencil away as before. Just then, he heard two light knocks on the door. Before he could answer, the door opened.</p>
<p>He Jian turned to look and saw that it was not the one-eyed gentleman, but a Japanese man in a Western suit, with a calm and agile demeanor. He entered the room and bowed respectfully to He Jian:</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. He Jian? ... The Chancellor invites you to see him." He Jian stood up to greet him and returned the bow in the same manner, ready to leave. The man stretched out his hands and made a gesture, "I'm sorry." He bowed again, "There is a small formality here. I am responsible for all guests who come to see the Chancellor... I am truly sorry... truly sorry." He blocked the way.</p>
<p>He Jian understood what he meant, knowing that he wanted to search him. He elegantly took out the things in his pockets and placed them on the central round table, then walked over and asked the man to search him. The man looked at He Jian and said that there was no need to search his person, but he would have to take two items from the table, which he was very sorry about. He walked over and first picked up the propelling pencil, showing the Japanese habit of suspecting everything. He looked at it, tapped it, and then put it aside. The second item was the exquisite cigarette case, which he also inspected carefully. He found the folded piece of paper, glanced at it, and put it back as it was. Fortunately, this Japanese man was probably not of 100% pure blood, and his movements were not as dull, trivial, clumsy, and hesitant as those of the "purebred."</p>
<p>"The procedure is complete... It's just that... the school pencil and this cigarette case will have to be kept by me temporarily. I am very sorry."</p>
<p>Only then did He Jian, led by the man, pass through the large hall and walk through two winding corridors. The entire architectural design and style here were completely Europeanized. At the end of the corridor, the man stepped forward and gently opened the small door at the end, then made another bow and invited He Jian to enter. As the small door opened, He Jian heard a burst of soft and elegant music, like a samisen or a Chinese zither.</p>
<p>As He Jian stepped into the door, he suddenly felt a change of scenery. Everything was antique and classical, as if he had returned to the pure Japanese style of "Hakkō ichiu." Directly in front of him was a screen, a very elegant local art product. Behind the screen was a row of four lattice doors, with four "wind-defeating" lamps hanging above the doors and the screen. Although the lamps were Japanese style, they were electric lamps inside. As soon as He Jian stepped into the door, two heavily made-up and very enchanting women emerged from behind the screen, as if they were crawling out. It could also be said that they were bowing and crawling out all the way. Although the two women did not dare to speak loudly, they kept muttering, "Good evening," and "You've worked hard," and so on. When they were still two steps away from He Jian, the two women simply knelt down together and kowtowed incessantly. After kowtowing, the two formally crawled over, one on each side, and rushed to He Jian's legs to take off his leather shoes.</p>

<h3>Deposits</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The problem of repaying pre-war deposits has repeatedly caused disputes and lawsuits in court. If the authorities do not quickly agree on a solution to this problem, it will continue to emerge endlessly, causing hardship for the courts, banks, and depositors, and making it impossible to cope.</p>
<p>I once saw a middle-aged woman crying and making a scene in the Shanghai Bank, demanding that the bank repay her pre-war deposit at two thousand times the original amount. Naturally, this crying and making a scene had no result, but at that moment, who among those present (even the bank staff) did not sympathize with the middle-aged woman?</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Court once ruled on a similar dispute, ordering repayment at one thousand times the principal and interest at maturity. This was the first precedent for resolving pre-war deposit repayment disputes since the victory, and may serve as a reference for financial or administrative authorities when deliberating on solutions in the future.</p>
<p>When deliberating on solutions in the future, we believe that a compromise is necessary to be fair, so that depositors do not suffer too much loss, and the burden on banks should also be taken into account. In short, both sides must suffer a little loss.</p>
<p>Currency depreciation affects everything. This is an unavoidable damage in war. We cannot draw on the compensation from the defeated aggressor countries to pay for it, but we can take a step back and think, what if this deposit was lost in the war? Wouldn't millions of people be bankrupted? As for the banks, they may as well think more about the interests of depositors. Even if they slightly increase the burden, they have to grit their teeth and sacrifice.</p>
<h3>If I Opened a Funeral Home</h3>
<p>— Takinotani</p>
<p>Shanghai people are the most clever in doing business. Not only do they borrow names like "Lu Gao Jian" and "Wang Mazi" as they are, but even locally made Chinese goods are fully equipped with Western texts. If they are forced to have a Chinese name, it is just translated from Western texts. Even more convenient and time-saving is to directly borrow foreign trademarks. For example, if there is a dog-head brand of cigarettes in the United States, and a cat-head brand of foreign wine in the United Kingdom, and they sell well, Shanghai will definitely have dog-head and cat-head brands of soap, handkerchiefs, and the like.</p>
<p>Following the example, the author makes the following design book:</p>
<p>(1) If I open a funeral home, I must borrow the name of the famous watch brand "Omega" as the name of the hall. Because "Omega" is the last letter of the Greek alphabet "Ω", meaning "last", "finished", "death".</p>
<p>(2) If I build a private railway, its logo must borrow the "Camel" of the famous American cigarette, to show that the driving speed is faster than the state-owned railway.</p>
<p>(3) If I open a flower shop, I want to use Forget-me-not flower as a trademark. The flower veins in the center of each petal are particularly emphasized!!! (Alas! Alas! Alas!) Three English letters, so that the lovelorn can vent a sigh.</p>
<p>(4) It is said that some large-scale recruitment agencies in the United States specialize in providing temporary workers to bosses of striking factories. If I also make a trademark of (Lucky Strike), because the direct translation can be used as "Lucky Strike"!</p>
<p>(5) If I open a recruitment agency specializing in supplying child labor to major manufacturers, then I will not hesitate to borrow the name of the American "Klim" milk powder, because "Klim" is KLIM, which is the reverse writing of "牛乳" MILK, and I secretly mean that the child labor introduction office may not be named "Dairy Cow".</p>
<p>(6) After talking about business, if I also join in the fun and make a so-called "political party", then the Swiss watch brand "Movado" is just right as "Party" and "Esperanto" (that is, "Esperanto") means "activities, continue activities".</p>
<p>(7) Let's talk about buying and selling again. If I open a hat shop specializing in supplying all kinds of people who are intent on making a fortune, then the famous American Eversharp ("Yongjian") brand of propelling pencil is very readily available, isn't it?</p>
<p>(8) Someone asked me, if you run a banknote printing company, what kind of foreign-flavored store name would you give it? Answer: Borrow the American readily available flashlight brand "Eveready", "Permanent Preparation", Permanent Preparation also.</p>
<p>(9) Say a digression. If someone runs a women's apartment that allows men to enter and exit, but prohibits this and that nonsense, then a readily available American commodity name for women only, called "Kotex" looks like "Hotel", how about it?</p>
<p>(10) But I still can't think of a suitable use to borrow this trademark: give, a woodpecker tied with a rope. That is a famous European household medicine for parents who do not want to have children.</p>
<p>All of the above are copyrighted, and may not be used in practice without the permission of "Free Talk". OIC, I know. (The last three foreign letters. It's just right to use as the trademark of the eyewear store. Just right.)</p>
<p>Two American teenagers (left and right, sixteen years old and seventeen years old) were sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to kill their father.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross-section</p>
<h3>The Organization of Beggars 7</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Opening Car Doors</p>
<p>Shanghai's cars are the best in the country. When cars stop or start on the street, it also creates an opportunity for almsgiving. At this moment, the old brothers of the beggar gang are not willing to miss it easily; because this is also a new way for the local kids to make money. Those who take cars are nothing more than rich old men and rich wives. The beggars are quick to open and close the car doors for them. In the pre-war period, they could get one yuan or several jiao for a little effort, but now they can get several hundred yuan. In places with more cars coming and going, they can have a very good income within an hour. Therefore, they follow suit, and the brothers in the gang are blinded by profit and flock to it. At present, there are more than 1,000 people in the city who specialize in this business. Their activity places are nothing more than the front and near of major restaurants, hotels, theaters, and dance halls. There are also places where books are gathered, as well as banks, apartments, and so on. They wait, and when they see a car parked, they run over to open the car door. After the rich old men get out of the car, they hurriedly close the car door with a shout, so they have a reason to ask the rich old men for money. They also say auspicious words. If they don't give money, they immediately retaliate with unfavorable and evil voices. Because once the rich old men enter the gate, they lose the opportunity to make money. If they don't call out quickly, they will miss the opportunity. The rich old men have learned from the past experience of being scolded, and know that it is not good not to give, so they are willing to pay to dismiss them quickly. But rich people often don't have change on them. They only have one or two thousand bills when they reach into their pockets. When there is no way, they have to grit their teeth and pay. This is all the good luck of the beggars. No wonder they enjoy it.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the drivers leave the car for something, they can also act as guards. If the car owner drives by himself, the beggars can volunteer to serve as guards. In fact, these people do not have the ability to guard, but only have the ability to receive rewards. When the car owner comes back, they all boast about their achievements in a plausible way.</p>
<p>In order to open car doors and earn a good income, the sections are rich and poor. The uncles of the gang have to divide the territory clearly. On the one hand, to avoid the same gang fighting, on the other hand, they can distribute the territory and reject the covetous eyes of laymen and rascals. However, only the children and the old and weak brothers are allowed to pull the car doors, because the old and young beggars are more likely to receive alms, but the young and strong beggars are all abandoned.</p>
<p>Rewards for Funerals and Celebrations</p>
<p>Beggars in various parts of China have always been in close contact with the people. Especially when holding wedding, funeral, birthday, and celebration ceremonies, it is always inevitable to be disturbed by the visit of beggars. This custom has been popular since ancient times. In Shanghai, the old brothers of the beggar gang are in the lead because of the geographical advantage and the harmony of people. This excellent job has always been regarded as a forbidden fruit, and other beggar gangs are not allowed to intervene.</p>
<p>The wealth of Shanghai residents is far better than that of the inland, and the customs are also fond of face. The uncle gangs in various sections are idle on weekdays, specializing in inquiring about weddings and funerals in their jurisdiction. They are really omnipotent, and the communication network is far and wide. The beggars linger in the streets and alleys all day long, and as soon as they get the news, they immediately report to the uncle generation, one pass ten, ten pass one hundred, and then the uncle reports to the beggar leader. At that time, they will lead the beggars to the funeral and celebration to ask for money. The way to ask for money is different for red and white matters. Please describe them separately:</p>
<h3>When a Fire Occurs</h3>
<p>— Maozai translated from Reader's Digest</p>
<p>(Editor's note: This is an article from the June "Reader's Digest". Although the time is not fresh, but for the sake of the dry weather, the authorities are promoting fire prevention, it seems necessary to introduce it to readers.)</p>
<p>Firefighters always say that the most perfect house will also be the easiest to run out of from the inside. We can also say that the best homeowner is the one who knows how to quickly escape to the outside of the house in case of fire.</p>
<p>Do you think this is ordinary and very simple? Then, in the cities of the western United States, there are two teenagers who, when a fire occurs, they have the opportunity to cross from their bedroom to the balcony, and then step on the roof and jump safely into the garden below; however, they died at the door of the third-floor bedroom; the reason is nothing else, they, just like ordinary people, in the extreme panic after discovering the fire, went straight to the ladder - an action that can never be completed.</p>
<p>Fire Downstairs</p>
<p>Three-quarters of fire deaths are due to fire downstairs, hot smoke rising, and suffocation upstairs; when the fire burns below, smoke, flammable gases, and temperatures as high as eight hundred or one thousand degrees quickly spread to the upper part of the house; just imagine, waking up from a dream, dazed, panicked, and rushing out of the bedroom to the stairs, can you not fall to the ground halfway? The most pitiful thing is that these victims had stopped breathing long before the flames reached them, and they had the opportunity to escape?</p>
<p>Further thinking and training can indeed save thousands of deaths. You wake up and smell a very strong smell of smoke, remember, do not jump up and open the door. You should raise your palm and press it on the door above your head. If a wooden board is hot, do not open the door. Hot wooden boards or doorknobs show that the space outside the bedroom is full of suffocating smoke and flames. It is impossible to go to the stairs.</p>
<p>You should keep the door closed and try to get out of the window, or call for help at the window. With the door blocking this general current, you can wait for the savior to arrive, and you have more chances to be saved.</p>
<p>Assuming that you find that the door is not hot, you should also open it carefully; use your feet and buttocks to hold the door tightly, ready to close it at any time, with one hand raised and pressed on the door seam above your head, slightly open one or two inches to test for pressure or hot steam. If there is, close it quickly and seek a way out to the window.</p>
<p>Closing Door Techniques</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the technique of closing the door; often, when we find that a fire has occurred, we are embarrassed and rush out of the door in a hurry, leaving the door wide open; we must know that the result of opening the door of the burning room will make the accumulated smoke and flames and hot steam spread horizontally and vertically to all parts of the entire house and accelerate its end. We should absolutely close the door at the right time, so that the flames and ripe smoke are confined in one room. Just for a few minutes of delay, the entire house may have the hope of being preserved.</p>
<p>Let's describe a fact. A young wife wanted to use some kerosene to light the gas in the kitchen. Unfortunately, the explosion of the gas filled the entire kitchen with flames; she was at a loss. When the horror was first settled, the first thought that came into her mind was the baby sleeping upstairs. She turned around and flew upstairs, snatched the child, and returned downstairs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the neighbors also discovered it and immediately called the fire department within a mile. The fire department came quickly, but when they arrived, they found that the pair of poor mothers and children were lying upstairs.</p>
<p>Her face showed the pain of being strangled by smoke and fire. Undoubtedly, they were killed by the rising smoke and flames - the only reason was that she did not close the door of the burning kitchen.</p>
<p>Firefighters admit that millions of the dead would be saved if they could understand, remember, and implement these two simple rules - opening and closing the door - they would still be happy and living happily.</p>
<p>Remember, you - my friend!</p>
<h3>Talking about Water Houses</h3>
<p>— Hong Yu</p>
<p>It is reported that someone proposed: Land houses can be extended to the water. In fact, people living on the water, in addition to another ethnic group in Fujian Province, the "boat people", Cangwu in Guangxi, at the intersection of the Gui River and the Xun River, because the land area is small, the families living in the water, accounting for one-third. According to the structure of the boat, wooden boats are arranged horizontally below, and wooden boards are placed on top to create flat houses or buildings. There are also magnificent buildings that make people envious. Speaking of Shanghai), wasn't there also a floating hotel on the Bund along the Huangpu River outside Beijing Road before the war? The decoration was gorgeous, and there were floors and platforms, with noble Western food and cold drinks, specially supplied to the general wealthy gentlemen, leisurely spending the summer there. During the occupation, the enemy used it as a gendarmerie residence, and I don't know how many tragedies were staged in it! Now this floating hotel, the outline is still there, but the interior is completely different, so it has not been repaired and is open to the public for use. Others, like the Suzhou River area, many poor people have built a lot of camp-style thatched huts along the shore and riverside, but the foundations have wooden stakes nailed in the water. Those residents, since they do not have to pay housing donations and land taxes, are leisurely humming in it. "Three flowers bloom, again and again" of the clear song. According to this, building houses on the water is indeed very possible. But it seems impossible to rely on it to solve the housing shortage. Because the key to the housing shortage is not the real lack of houses, but the lack of large yellow croaker and small yellow croaker. Now some people set this daydream, to expand the territory on the water, in fact, they are also calculating that since it is near the water, it is easy to catch fish. But it should be noted that although the Huangpu River has the hat of the word Huang, it lacks the word "gold" below. At the same time, the yellow croaker is not produced in the Pujiang River, but must go to the sea to catch it. Knowing this, we can know that there are many empty spaces in Zhabei and Nanshi, so there is no need to "hang and langdang" to daydream on the water.</p>

<h3>Prohibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Yuan</p>
<p>If usury were to be completely eliminated one day due to the most severe prohibitions, my prediction is: one, those who make a living from usury will lose their jobs; two, hot money will grab gold; three, more than two-tenths of the shops will immediately declare bankruptcy; four, Chinese stocks will plummet to the point where no one dares to buy.</p>
<h3>Pressure</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Nanjing and Shanghai are eliminating pedicabs, and inland cities are eliminating wheelbarrows; this elimination means pressing down one level. Pedicabs go to inland cities, and wheelbarrows go to the countryside.</p>
<h3>Tears</h3>
<p>— Chen Dexin</p>
<p>"When the candle tears fall, the people's tears fall, and where the songs are high, the complaints are high!" Please enjoy and use, gentlemen and ladies who are free and easy day and night, savor it more! Do more good! A boat can carry you, and it can also overturn you, be careful!</p>
<h3>Cold</h3>
<p>— Hesong</p>
<p>Everyone says it's cold this year, but I think that in addition to the weather factors, the more important thing should be that everyone's clothes are less than in previous years.</p>
<h3>Frozen</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Recently, people have often frozen to death, and most of them are children.</p>
<p>I still remember that a few days ago, some young people lined up to express their gratitude to the municipal government and other agencies. Because they were originally wandering in the streets, but now they are "not afraid of hunger and freezing." The mayor said in his reply that it is the government's responsibility to raise and care for the wandering.</p>
<p>I hear more people expressing their gratitude to the government!</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Mo Dehui</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the government is about to reorganize, and the seat of the President of the Executive Yuan has become the center of speculation and discussion from all sides. A few days ago, it was rumored that Zhang Qun and Sun Ke had the highest voice, and recently it was suddenly rumored that Mo Dehui had a good hope. Regarding Zhang and Sun, this journal has already recorded them before. Now, let me talk about this old Mr. Mo.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo is sixty-four years old this year, with the alias of Liu Chen, originally from Shuangcheng County, Jilin. After graduating from the regular course of Beiyang Higher Police Academy, he served in the police circles of Harbin. He served as the director of the Harbin Police Bureau, and the magistrates of Shuangcheng, Yushu, and Binjiang counties in Jilin Province. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he served as a consultant for the Headquarters of the Commander of the Security of the Three Eastern Provinces. In the fifteenth year, he served as the acting governor of Fengtian Province. When Zhang Zuolin was bombed and killed at the Huanggu Tun Railway Station, Mr. Mo was nearby and suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he took office as a member of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, the Chairman and Supervisor of the China Eastern Railway. In May of the same year, he was sent to Soviet Russia as the full representative of our country to the Sino-Soviet Conference. He had experience in negotiating with Russian officials. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Russian Emperor awarded Mr. Mo the St. Stanislaus Third Class Medal.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo's lifelong behavior can be summarized by the eight characters "integrity and kindness". He does not like to be flattered. On the contrary, if a friend can frankly criticize his faults, Mr. Mo will be very happy and immediately correct them.</p>
<p>For a period of time, he would stay in his hometown and live alone, as a person in the opposition. He devoted himself to local autonomy and education and other matters, so in today's Northeast, Mr. Mo is still a "popular figure."</p>
<p>After the victory, the Northeast could not be successfully recovered, and then the flames of war ignited. Mr. Mo looked at his hometown from afar, unable to return home, and was saddened by national affairs. He once wept bitterly in public and became a kind-hearted old man.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo Dehui had an excellent political reputation in the past. Today, with a detached position of being non-partisan and non-factional, he is not a suitable candidate for an important position in the central government.</p>
<h3>Who is the Murderer?</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>In a fleeting moment like a shooting star, Sullivan, a once prominent tycoon, was suddenly shot dead, collapsing with bullets riddling his body on the stone steps in front of the National Farm.</p>
<p>He was a cruel murderer, feared not only by the shop owners extorted by his underlings but also by his own followers. His arrogance and selfishness grew in proportion to his power, but when he refused to share the spoils equally and sought to enrich himself alone, he was killed.</p>
<p>Before the trial, Professor Hodaney knew that eight of his disciples were planning to "send him off." Their names were (1) Bai Mou, (2) Ma Er, (3) Li Jin, (4) Wu Te, (5) Ye Jiu, (6) Xu Xin, (7) Qiao Sheng, (8) Bao Dexing—these were the most formidable of the disciples—one of whom killed his old man, Sullivan.</p>
<p>After several dangerous investigations, Professor Hodaney learned the following facts.</p>
<p>(1) Bai Mou, Li Jin, and the murderer were the most dissatisfied with Sullivan.</p>
<p>(2) Among the eight, one was Sullivan's personal bodyguard (private protector), and it was very secret; only Ye Jiu and Qiao Sheng knew who he was.</p>
<p>(3) The day before the murder, Xu Xin, Bao Dexing, Bai Mou, and the personal bodyguard lost a lot of money in the casino.</p>
<p>(4) A week ago, Ma Er, Ye Jiu, and the murderer jointly demanded that Sullivan publicly and equally distribute the spoils. After being refused, Wu Te and the murderer persuaded the personal bodyguard to "take him out," but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>(5) In this revolt against Sullivan, the leaders were Xu Xin, Bao Dexing, and the murderer.</p>
<p>All eight have been arrested. Since they refuse to tell the truth, Professor Hodaney, based on the above five facts, identified who the personal bodyguard was and who the murderer was.</p>
<p>Who is it? Who is the personal bodyguard? Who is the murderer? (Translated from Pockor Ententainer)</p>
<p>The answer will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
