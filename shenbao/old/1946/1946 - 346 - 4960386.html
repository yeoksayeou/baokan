<h3>國都問題展開辯論　第一審查會中掌聲不絕　張斷發方贊成建都北平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲單中最受人注意之國都問題，十一日午於第一審委會中展開熟烈辯論，主張建都北平者，以張繼作前鋒，主張建都南京者，推劉百閔爲發言人，社會賢達仇鰲則提出第三種主張，建議建於最艱苦之西安，各逞雄辯，自四時一刻起至六時止，商討歷時幾近二小時，仍未獲最後給論，定十二日上午九時續商，屆時恐尚將有一塲激辯。張知本於討論國旗問題即宣布討論總綱第七條國都問題，全塲一致鼓掌，空氣頓由沉寂轉爲熟鬧，主張建都北平之遼寗代表張輯顏，首起發言，認此問題爲定都，應非建都問題，盼能一本良心，多爲國家民族着想，繼就歷史觀點指出建都北平之優點，以明淸爲例，說明定都北平國家可長治久安，而在南京之梁武帝及民國，皆多內憂外患，就地理而論，北平亦利於防守，不若南京勿受威脅，並說明當年日人覬覦東北，即因我政府遠在南京，無暇計及華北，當更無力兼顧東北，乃發動九一八事件。决起發言者爲仇　，渠雖爲湘籍，然爲全局打算，力主建都西安，其理由爲我人建都應擇最艱苦與最需而救濟之地點，西北日趨荒冷，人口日減，我人不應貪岡南京或北平舒服，遂遺忘西北，請勿忘生於憂患之古訓。至是，黨國元老張繼發言，全塲熱烈鼓掌，張首說明國都在全部憲法中爲最重要最具體之間題，盼勿意氣用事，此事非南北之爭，亦非黨派之爭，國民黨對此亦未有所決議，故儘有討論自由。决分析有關建都問題提案，認主張建都南京者僅絕少數，而贊成建都北平者佔絕大多數，盼勿違反眾人之意。張解釋國父主張建都南京本旨，據稱：本人可謹填謂，國父主張建都南京，係一時之事，非永久的，就環境與現實言，本人贊成建都北平，有人反對建都該地者，以該地昆連強鄰，恐不安全，惟應知生於憂患之古語，越危險越應遷往，即我國軍事權威陳誠將軍等，最近與談及時，亦有此種看法，我人若再建都南京，非亡國不可，語單，眾大鼓掌。贊成憲法中不規定國都所在地之原提案人何遂發言，認憲法爲永久性的，不應將流動性之國都問題列人在此原子彈時代，若有戰爭，南京固須遷都，北平一樣遷，不若不規定爲好。河北代表以幽默語調駁斥建都南京，據謂：國父當年建都南京，係因該地封建色彩太濃，軍閥勢力根深蒂固，且有外國勢力，目前上述種種咸己一掃而空且此次提案，蘇·浙·粵等省代表均有連署者，可見非僅係北方代表意見，芳謂房屋不數，北平谷機關皆在遷平後即可辦公，並說明即有事實困難，憲法決定後，非立即實行，仍　延遲。平代表孫純武及綏代表祁必厚，代表二萬萬人民三個民族發言，主張建都北平，吳曉道根據邊疆及國防原因，主張建都南京，並說明遷都之困難，芳謂決定後可暫不遷，此無異開一空頭支票。賀揚靈謂，憲章規定建都南京，各黨派皆予同意，並說明歷史不足爲建都北平強有力證明，而明太社，洪秀全與孫總理三革命政府，皆建都南京。任卓宣認國都爲一事，外患又爲一事，建都北平同樣曾發生喪權辱國之事，此事應指責政府，而不應批評地點。劉百閔反駁張繼理論，認國父不但一時主張建都南京，實業計劃中且有永久建都南京計劃，南京實爲革命首都，並請記住日人在南京大屠殺故事，激辯至六時，請求發言者仍踴躍，定十二日繼續討論。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草第二審委會十一日上午九時開第四次全體會於大會會塲出席代表二五七人，張強主席首由林彬報吿提案之整理工作尚未完竣，深致歉意。繼邵力子建議爲經濟時間，請免將廣泛意見歸倂整理，並謂可即就提案加以討論俟整理工作完成，再迅速付諸表決，孔庚等立即反對，謂非惟過去之廣泛意見須併案整理，目前仍要繼續廣泛討論，於是各代表紛紛發言，至十一時五十分宣吿散會。</p>
<p>下午三時四十分繼續開會於大會會塲，出席代表二一一人，朱鴻儒主席，開始依憲草對第三章「國民大會」逐條討論，大部代表主張須規定國大之性質，雖經邵力子與陶希聖力主應據憲草討論，會眾仍通過於章首加入「國民大會爲中華民國國民行使政權之最高機關」，作爲第二十六條，原第二十六條推後爲第二十七條，並部份修改爲「國民大會以左列代表組織之（一）每縣市及其同等區域各選出代表一人，其人口逾三十萬者，增選代表一人（二）蒙古各旗西藏地方及少數民族之名額，由法律另定之」。立監委爲國大代表之規定，均被刪除，職蒙及僑民代表之規定以時間不敷，留待十二日繼續討論，至六時散會。</p>

<h3>「雙十二」紀念　臨潼西安無擴大儀式</h3>
<p>〔本報西安十一日電〕記者凌晨由臨　歸來，沿路朔風冰霜，寒氣堪與十年前今晨之飄雪相比。臨潼谷界塈軍官總隊，十二日無特殊擴大之念儀式，誌此十年前中華民族史上轉捩點，西安市十二日亦無擴大紀念儀式，想係留待廿五日一併舉行。</p>
<h3>憲草總綱第一條　中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國　經第一審委會多數通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草總綱第一條，經第一審委會十一日第四次會議再付表決，出席一五三人，以一〇七票多數通過，修改爲「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」，惟靑年黨代表常塲聲明該案旣經以絕對多數通過，少數黨不擬再在會中發表意見，惟保留發言權，俾在大會中發言。民社黨對第一條亦保留發言權。又憲草總綱第二條原文爲：「中華民國之主權屬於人民全體」，亦以一百十六票之多數改爲「中華民國之主權屬於國民全體」。原案第三條「具有中華民國國籍者，爲中華民國國民」會中一致無異議照原案通過。</p>
<p>第一審會係十一日晨九時三刻假中央黨部舉行，張知本王席，言討論如何處理昨日會中表決而未過牛數之總綱第一條問題，當時意見可分成兩派，靑年黨閔達，周竇三等主張將昨日討論結果送綜合委會審查，江萬平等附議，惟多數代表咸主將各種意見於今日會中再付審查，蓋根據國大議事規則第五十條「經表決仍無可決之結果，如係不得廢棄之議題，應再付審查」，閔達等認二决審查不合法，堅主提交綜合會，且一度表示退出，會塲空氣相常緊張，民社黨李俊夫起而說明「會塲內外大多數人之意見」，未說畢即有若十代表起立說話，秩序極亂幸經召集人之一黃少谷高聲發言，說明情形，並謂「引起此種誤會，很爲可惜」，會塲乃復歸平靜。旋表決應吾送综合委會，當時在塲一五四人僅七十一人贊成，不滿牛數，惟爲此事棄涉政治問題，並保持會塲和諧計，再作反表決，贊成繼續討論者八十二人，乃繼續進行審查，，先決定於票數最多之兩案中表決，「中華民國爲基於三民主義之民主共和國」，僅得三十三票，遭否決，「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」以一〇七票之大多數通過，全塲一致鼓掌。</p>
<p>至此同，可北代表吳延環起而發言謂：「余爲國民黨員，願意湊合事實，不斤斤於文字之爭」。靑年黨代表閔達則鄭貢聲明謂「此一問題旣經表決，贊成者佔絕對多數，少數黨之意見不擬再在會中發表，惟保留發言權，俾在大會中發言」，與會者對此種精神，咸鼓掌表示贊同</p>
<p>此關係重大之第一條通過後，各代表乃平心靜氣繼續討論第二條，該條原文爲「中華民國之主權，屬於人民全體」，代表對該案共提出九個修正案，歸納可成大類，最重要之更動爲主張將「人民「兩字改爲「國民」。靑年黨夏爾康即認「人民」與「國民」不同，不能引爲一談，江蘇代表周　山謂：若用「人民」，即與前言及第三條前後不符，並指出民元臨時的法即規定「屬於國民」。職業代表江萬平亦認我人以國民代表資格來會，何以不用「國民」，任草宣認外國僑民來我國居住，得享人民權利，惟未取得國籍不爲我國民，故非主權來源，主權應來自取得國籍之國民。</p>
<p>陳顧遠謂：憲草所以用「人民」而不用「國民」，如有其原因，同時主權在國民，容易由人民主權說變成國家主權說，演成德國式之集權國家，希望原起草人說明。吳經熊乃起而報吿，說明約法及天壇憲法規定，謂根據後者主權屬於「人民」，並指出屬於人民與間於政府之不同點，惟認此點作爲字面上之之權，最後宜付表決，當時在場一百六十人，以一一六票之多數，通過將「人民」，改爲「國民」，全文改爲「中華民國之主權，屬於國民全體」，全塲亦一致鼓掌。</p>
<p>繼討論第三條「具有中華民國國籍者，爲中華民國國民」，全塲一致無異議贊成維持原案，修正案不予討論。</p>
<h3>憲法對領土問題　通過採概括方式</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲法對領土應如何予以規定一點，第一審查會十一日上下午開會時，曾詳加討論，並經多數表決，將原案「中華民國領土依其固有之疆域非依法律不得變更之」修改爲「中華民國領土依其固有之疆域，非經國民大會之決議，不得變更之」。第五條「中華民國各民族一律平等」及第六條一中華民國國旗定爲紅地左上角靑天白日」略經討論後，咸通過維持原案。</p>
<h3>第六審委會　開五六次會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草第六審委會十一日舉行第五，六兩决會，分別由谷正鼎，方少雲担往主席，全日共通過一一四條，一一六條，一一八條，一一九條四條，一一五條則推張維，阮毅成，張伯倫，鄧翔海，李鈺，方少雲，劉中一七人整理，再交大會討論。一一七條由召集人請起草人於十二日出席說明後討論。一二〇條決定十二日繼續討論後再整理。</p>
<h3>第七審查委會　兩組工作結束</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草第七審委會各小組，除第一國防外交及第四社會安全兩小組工作己吿結束外，第三教育文化小組，九時開整理小組會議，出席傳斯年，賴璉等十人，就有關提案及各項農泛意見加以歸納整理，積極進行工作，至十二時半始散。第二國民經濟小組，上午會議外下午三時四十分繼續開會，出席代表八八人，仍由劉振東主席，依王曉籟等之提案，討論通過代替憲草修正案第一三九條前半有關農業土地規定之條文如下：（一）「中華民國領域之土地屬於國民全體，其經人民依法律取得所有糟者，其所有權受法律之保障及限制，私有土地應照便納稅，政府並得照價征教」，（二）一附着於土地之鑛及經濟上可供公眾利益之天然力，屬於國家所有，不因向民取得所有權而受影響」（三）「土地價值非因施以勞力資本而增加者，應以征收士地增價稅方法教歸人民公共享受」（四）「國家對於土地之分配整理，以抉植自耕農及自行使用土地人爲原則」，至不午六時散會，定十二日上午十時開召集人會議，下午三時開第五次小組全體會。第三教育文化小組整理小組，下午二時亦繼續工作，經將各成立提案及廣泛意見參照五五憲草及修正案　納整理，擬就十條，自教育之宗旨至文教事業之保障，議皆包括，並決定提出十二日上午九時之第四次小組全體會。</p>
<h3>民社黨發表聲明　對國家之名稱保留意見　請待綜合委會重付表決</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕民社黨發言人蔣勻田，十一日晚發　表談話稱：今晚本黨會議，根據出席憲草各審委會召集人報告，有所決議，本人茲奉命作如下聲明：（一）今日憲草第一審委會對憲草第一章第一條修改爲「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」，本黨代表當即書面聲明，保留少數當意見。（二）今日憲草第三審委會對憲草第四章第四十四條增加「緊急事變」四字，本黨代表當即聲明，保留少數黨意見，一倂留待綜合審委會請求軍付表決。假使少數黨意見不能獲得多數黨尊重老慮，則本黨對參加制憲工作，將考慮適常辦法。蔣氏又稱：第三方面人士消息，謂本黨少數領袖主張實行淸黨，絕無其事。</p>
<h3>審委會風浪洶湧</h3>
<p>— 本報記者</p>
<p>——吵架·退席·新聞記者被擋駕</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日〕第一審委會討論第一條時，對應吾貢行討論一點，引起軒然大波，靑年黨黨員幾至退席。閔達，周竇三等戴帽携書預備走出，後爲其他代表勸止。昨日要求退席之民社黨李俊夫，今日因代表不准其報吿，又鬧退席，惟爲在旁者勸住。</p>
<p>討論主權屬於「人民」抑「國民」時，某廣東代表與吳經熊大談英女，陳顧遠大談其主權來源，說者謂今日之會有似上大學「比較憲法」課。</p>
<p>江萬平之言最妙，渠謂：「同人等係以國民代表資格出席國大，憲法中何以不用「國民」而用「人民」，言畢哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>吳延環代表謂，領土決不可變更，再有失地情形，地下列祖列宗必將罵我們「不是好小子」。</p>
<p>女代表郭昌鶴大聲疾呼，反對領土採列舉法，據稱「我們過去的土地，香港等地我們亦要收回，國家鎮士不能爲本屆國大所斷送！」</p>
<p>第二審委會開會時，又「廣泛討論」，老孔庚一講講了十幾分鐘，靑年黨代表朱瑞熙起立請主席張強注意發言時間，孔老頭子大大的冒了火，他的十幾個小集團，也一躍而起，四面入方奔到朱的座位周圍，手指口斥，大輿問罪之師，幾有動武之勢。張主席大聲疾呼「秩序」，才把這全武行的局勢壓下去。朱代表在大多數人同情下，一聲不響的坐了一會，就退席了。孔老頭子又一躍上台說：「剛才因爲某某代表予涉我的發言權，引起了秩序的混亂，這眞是『一犬吠影，百犬吠聲」……」舉座聽得坐立不安，他又搖頭擺腦的大發「宏論」起來。</p>
<p>總統章第四十五條，關於總統得召集各有關院長會商解決院間爭執一點，在政協憲草審議會裏就有爭辯，結果是民社黨讓步了。不想第三審委會裏國民黨代表之問又發生了不同的意見。王世杰，羅鼎主張刪去，潘公展主張保留，表決之後以四十四票較多數，維持原案，潘打了勝仗。</p>
<p>豫區代表何紼情又大發「預備總統」的妙論，如何，如何，冀職代表張子揚馬上站起來：「本席反對這位代表的意見，「預備總統」沒有必要，如果要選「預備總統」，那麼「名譽總統』等等也可以選了！」結果付表決，第一次贊成「預備總統」的只有何一人，第二次原領銜提案的李敬齋才笑着舉了手，「預備總統」的妙案，宣吿完畢。</p>
<p>第七審委會第一國防外交小組，今晨突然拒絕記者旁聽，記者問「是不是開秘密會？如果是，我們就不推去。「憲兵老爺答：「不知道？反正不許你們進去。」「我們去問問那個職員好不好？」「不行，新聞記者誰也不許進這個門。」「那麼是誰的命令呢？排長？營長？處長？」「都不是，是『高頭』」到他們的「高頭」一問，原來是冷欣主席的悶頭命令，打聽一下討論內容，稀鬆平常，誰也說不來是「國防秘密」？「外交秘密」？</p>
<p>孔庚發火時，賴璉從教育文化小組會議席中走出來，站在樓廳裏參觀，他一邊笑，一邊搖頭，記者望望他，他趕緊回去開會。</p>
<p>國都問題下午於第一審委會提出前，全塲先熱烈鼓掌，一若好戲開塲前情形，而張溥老演說先後博得掌聲卅餘决，似梅蘭芳之壓軸戲。至主張北平與主張南京者之爭，渾似國劇中京派與海派唱對台戲，最後又殿以某女代表退席糾紛，幾鬧全武行，從頭到底，極似一幕「大會串」。</p>
<p>討論國都問題時，各代表滿口地理名詞。歷史教訓，與上午滿口「主權」「國權」完全異趣。某代表謂上午似上憲法課，下午又似上地理，歷史課。</p>
<p>張輯顏爲北派打衝鋒，悶齒流利，地名極熟，渠認國都若無問題，可不規定，旣有間題，非予明文規定不可。並謂，有人因經濟困難反對還都，其理由之不充足與因經濟困難，不主召開國大同樣不合理。</p>
<p>湘籍社會賢達仇鱉，不主建都長沙，而生建都西安。渠認爲全局打算，應選擇最壤最苦之地點，不應應在」，飲食男女」舒服，房十闊氣的南京或北平建都。</p>
<p>當國元老張溥老演說愈一刻鐘，渠首先表明「本人非賣弄聰明」。據謂，就余所知。建都南京非國父之主張，國父主建都南京爲一時的主張，而非永久主張·最後並沉痛指出，若再建都南京，非亡國不可，演說畢掌聲歷久不息。</p>
<p>重慶代表賴健君一口四川話，希望大勿志陪都家重慶。賴氏沉痛謂，重慶爲敵轟炸入年，始終未屈，陪都兩字是用血寫成的。</p>
<p>反駁建都南京之吳延環謂：「國父今日若仍在世，亦必主張建都北平。」全塲哄然大笑。渠反對因總理寢陵在南京，遂主建都南京。據稱，「中華民族之老祖宗爲黃帝，其寢陵遠在荒涼不堪之陝西中部縣，豈我人非建都中部不可乎？有謂遷都化綫其實到廬山避暑，其所化之錢亦不在少數。」</p>
<p>劉百閔唱壓軸戲，力主建都南京，其最精彩一語，爲今日爲十一日，後日即爲日人大屠殺南京之十三日，南京有多少同胞爲首都而死，南京爲首都係用血寫成。另一代表亦指出南京在抗戰期間，雖未能久守，然北平之失，在南京之先，不能因南京曾失守，而不主建都甫京。</p>

<h3>行總豫分署長報告　黃河堵口將完成　聯總代表稱泛濫區情形可怕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總河南分署署長馬傑，聯總代表魏斯特，及河南省建設應長宋彤，昨日下午在行總聯合招待記者，報吿黃泛區修復工程情形。首由爲氏報吿，略謂；黃河堵口工程即將完成，但堵口之最後目的，乃在恢復舊道，復興黃泛區，使該區人民均能安居樂業。馬氏並述目前行總所以急於趕修決口原因有三：（一）決口乃由於戰爭而造成，現戰事結束，難民自不應再使琉亡，應速使安定；（二）若此時再不趕修，則該區若干良田將不復能生產，成爲荒蕪之地；（三）黃河兩岸土地肥沃，適於耕種，如不加補救，該區糧食供應頗成問題，整理修竣以後，該區可供機器耕種之試驗地。但此項工作進行殊非易事，如兒童福利，交通衛生等問題，均難解決。</p>
<p>又據魏斯特氏稱：黃河泛濫區情形，至爲可怕，此種大泛濫，在世界歷史上僅於羅馬時代有之，而經二千年始治理畢事。美國ＴＶＡ之複雜情形，可與黃河相比，但其社會情形，自無中國之錯　。魏氏報吿黃泛區調查結果：該區共佔地一千六百五十萬畝，其中七百五十畝在河南境內，一且有九萬畝之地已滿長荒草，須一重加整理後始可耕種。同時據調一查，該區扶溝縣於一九三八年時一有人口三十二萬人，一年半前僅剩四萬四千人，其餘人口大都係逃亡失散或遭災殃而歿。目前則已增至十四萬人，均自各地歸鄉者，每週的五百人，但返鄉後仍無法解決衣食住問題。</p>
<p>最後由宋彤報吿河南省政府對此災情極爲關懷，特維織指導委員會，協助歸省居民進行各項事務，同時設法解決地權問題。該一會自經聯總行總救濟物資後，對於堆動工作已大見進步。</p>
<h3>董必武談話</h3>
<p>指救濟物資分配不公</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕董必武十一日晚就救濟物資之分配一事，對記者談稱：（一）救濟總署全國十五個分署，與共區有關者八個，人口佔百分之六十九，然其分配救濟物資則僅爲應得者百分之十，實不公平。聯總駐華辦事處前處畏雷氏，亦曾言此，比例爲一不好看之結論，蔣廷徽與雷氏曾擬改善未果，現新處長艾格頓亦擬改進，霍竇樹亦一再表示不應因黨派關係而有所歧視，但不公平之現象已成立。報載霍竇樹一聲明三點認爲其分配與共區物資之所以較少者因運來者多爲糧食，而共區爲產區，實不符事事實，如晉察區僅產黑豆，而湘贛區爲產糧軍，但仍有救濟物資之分配，故此事應慎黨處理。（二）聯總卅餘噸之重機器不必分與中共區，其實其中仍有若干輕機器，亦未分與。（三）黃河堵口事，共區已完成之工程，聯總已察看過，但因經費無着致險工無法做。</p>

<h3>美在哈設領　遭中共拒絕</h3>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕第國務院今日證實”中國共應黨會阻撥美政府在哈爾濱設立領事館之報吿。國務院發言人稱：美總領事克拉布會靜待共黨方面准其前往哈爾濱設立領館處八月之久，但因終於不獲共方准許，故目前仍在長春執行其領事職務。</p>
<h3>憲草中有關選舉諸問題</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　俞振基</p>
<p>（三）婦女與僑胞</p>
<p>根據憲軍第一二九條之規定，「中華民國國民年滿廿歲者，有依法選舉之權，除本憲法及法律另有規定者外，年滿廿三歲者，有依法被選舉之權」。第二章第八條亦規定「中華民國人民無男女…之分，在法律上一律平等」。惟此次提案中，有關選舉問題，仍有若干與婦女有關者。</p>
<p>陳顧遠等六十二代表，主張於一百卅條「本憲法所規定各種選舉之候選人，一律公開競選」之下，加一但書：「但關於國民大會代表及立委監委之選舉，應以法律規定女子當選之最少名額。」其所持理由爲當今父系社會，男女公開競選，勝利必　男子，故我國歷來事例，皆規定女子當選之最少名額，以免男女平等之徒成虛名，英議會亦有對女子而設之條文。衛挺生等五十二代表所提第八十六案，主張於廿六條「國大以左列國民代表組織之」之下，增加「婦女團體選出之代表一款。認如此可使女子與男子競選時，不致吃虧，並謂「婦女問題，必須婦女始能解決」。</p>
<p>最近逝世之女代表劉純一氏。生前亦會與倪桂馥等卅三代表，提出於一百卅條後增補一本黨法所規定之各項人選，其婦女名額不得少於十分之三」，此則較陳顧遠等之提案更爲具體矣。至其何以規定爲十分之三以上，則原提案並朱說明</p>
<p>此次一百提案中，另一與選舉有關者爲：僑胞是否有選舉監察委員一問題。根據憲草廿六條一項二款及九十五條各款之規定，華僑無選舉監委之　，要求增補之提案計有陳樹人等所提四件，其理由有下列數者：（一）憲草六十五條規定立委名額之分配，旣列有僑居國外之國民一款，而監委名額之分配，則缺此一款，故主增加；（二）僑胞爽直敢言，長於彈劾監察之能事，（三）依據廿六條之規定，藍委與立委同具兩種齊格，即同時具有國大代表賽格，因之其產生方法應與其他立藍委各種代表一律由人民直接選舉方爲合理，而廿六條一項二條及九十六所規定之監委覺作例外，而定由議會間接選舉，似此性質不同而法互異，故主一律由人民眞接選舉。</p>
<p>除上述各問題外，提案中所涉及之選舉問題尚有（一）直接選舉問接選舉，（二）國大代表是否有權選舉總統副本總統以外其他重要官吏問題，（三）現任實職官吏在未解職獲准以前，可吾參加國大代表競選問題，（四）選舉人與被選舉人年齡問題，（五）直轄市選舉國大代表等問題，此等問題相信審查會中，皆將有熱烈討論。（完）</p>
<h3>河內又發生事故　華僑五人被擊斃　法越不斷衝突僑胞流離失所</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內十日電〕自河內至海防之鐵路及公路交通，自上月二十三日以來，即吿中斷，從未恢復，因此運輸問題，乃成爲目前最嚴重之間題矣·擬乘坐飛機視察之結果，獲悉公路在某某數點，均已被破壞，鐵路路軋，亦多毀壞，不堪應用，故河內與海了兩城之交通工具，唯有飛機一項而已，以致重貨，歐洲人民這食物，以及甫自法國運來之行李，均不有運輸。此外又悉，河內東北約十公里之處，今晚又發生事件，聞有華僑五人爲越南人所擊斃，因此在華僑與越南人民之間，又趨緊張。</p>
<p>〔中央社河內十日電〕海防法越軍衝突　視華方中立事，截至昨日止，據調查所得，華僑死傷及失踪被捕者八百餘人，財產損一失值越幣二千九百餘萬元，流離失所，傷心慘目，殺氣所播，蔓及河內各地。法方決以武力解決越局，而越方則堅持必須法軍回復十一月廿日以前在海防諒山原駐地區，然後談判，各走極端，厲兵秣馬，一觸即發。對於我方所要求劃分中立區，切實護僑等事，仍未見有具體辦法。</p>
<h3>戰時民營工廠損失　可獲院部賠償　工協得參加對日賠償委會</h3>

<h3>明年度的市預算</h3>
<p>本市卅六年度預算歲入列二一〇，一九三，九八一，一二五元，歲出合計五二三，六七五，九一七，九九〇元，收支不敷達三一三，四八一，九三六，七七五元，這個虧空的數字，己覺駭人聽聞。據聞市府會商結果，實際收入數字，祇有一九〇，八〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，其中房捐，筵席捐等項並且還照現行的稅率估計，沒有把中央所規定的作爲標準。所以據最穩健的估計，據稱祗有一千一百億元的收入。那未，不敷的數字，竟在四千一百億元以上，超過實際的收入約三倍，超過市府商定的收入一倍有餘！</p>
<p>市府應付的辦法，是採量入爲出主義，就是按照本年下半年的預算，的略加一倍計算，總計的二一四，〇一七，四三三，四七〇元，再酌量緊縮，湊上一九〇八億的假想數字，其餘應行辦理的新增事項，另編一預算，另籌擬財源。就是說：有錢即辦，無錢不辦，有多少錢，辦多少事。據聞這項新財源的目標，大部份可能是公債。</p>
<p>語云：巧婦難爲無米之炊，實際上祇有這幾個錢，那麼，自然只能辦這幾件事。市府此次並不窮思極想，百方張羅款項，却很平實地維持現狀，堅持量入爲出主義，在大體上，很值得同情。</p>
<p>現在各地的財政，都鬧着虧空，其中的原因自然很多，很複雜，而百廢具舉，儘量點綴，多方地撐持塲面這一念，實在是造成虧空，擴大虧空的主因。所以然者，各機關的主管，爲責任心所驅使，對於職掌範園的事，本來多多益善，都抱着同時並舉的雄心，加上上糾機關的指示，長意機關的議決，和各方面的建議，不能不分頭應付，兼程並進，所以財政上的重要因素，反退居於决要的地位。爲挽回這個風氣，和彌補預算的短缺起見，除掉由各部會或各地方的最高長官因時因地，權衡輕重，予以統盤籌劃外，竟沒有其他的辦法。即如這次滬市歲入，限定爲一九〇八億，而維持現狀的歲出，却須二一四〇億。在數字上看來，似乎收支依舊不敷。其實各單位當初所造的預算，（卅五年下半年度）本來不很切實。原來在編製歲出和施政計劃的時候，巴不得多辦幾椿事，多要幾個錢，等到預算案確定了，却又因種種關係，預　的工作無法展開，以至許多款項，凍結在庫，無從請支。昨據一位幕中人見吿，某機關事業費沒有動支的，達三分之一。這話如果可靠，那末，把本年下半年度的費用加一倍，即作爲明年度的歲出預算，也還須切實地打一折扣。因爲表面上這雖是維持現狀，實際還帶着幾分理想也。</p>
<p>房捐，筵席捐等，最近立法院己經分別議決，其稅率遠比本市現行的爲低。在這市財政大鬧虧空的時候，我們如果說：該照中央稅率征收，好像有點和市財政當局開玩笑，太不近人情。其實這是法治精神所繫，不是幾個錢的問題。假如依法減征以後，確實不够開文，我們的理想是：寗可另籌其他合法的新財源來抵補，不願意明目張胆地弁髦中央的法律，</p>
<p>我們還得承認：這幾個錢的出入，並不足以過分地影響市預算，將來影響市預算最厲害的是物價，不是一部份減征的捐稅。假如明年物價，依舊直錢上漲，公務員的待遇，每三個月，仍須照例調整一次，而各項工料，購置，修理等費，又必須隨時增加，那末，原定百分五的預備費，和三百六十億的調整生活補助費，恐怕還是無濟於事。</p>
<p>所以在承平時候，預算上的數字？確乎值得重視。在這個經濟上的非常時候，與其錙銖必較地謀所收支數目的相等，倒不如穩定物價，解決工商業的危機來得切實。我們打開本市的歲入表來看，營業稅，牌照稅，碼頭捐之類，固然與市面的盛衰，關係其密，便是其他屠宰稅，筵席及娛樂稅，族棧捐，一切規費，公有營業收入，房捐及公用事業附征的建設捐等等，也何一不與市面同其休戚？所以本市明年度的預算，其準確性不在於目前估計之數字，而在於物價及市面的變遷。</p>
<h3>澀谷事件判決不當　我代表提出異議　對日警責任應進行調查</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十日電〕澀谷事件中被捕之我合胞卅六人，經二月又半之鞠後，已於今日下午宣判，其中二人經判無罪開釋，一人被判服苦役三年，其他卅三人被判服苦役二年。被判有罪之臺胞，將被驅逐出境，在盟軍佔領期間不准重返日本。與其他美法官二人共同組成三人委員會負責審鞠澀谷案之國際法庭我國委員裘君，於宣判後，立即提出異議，裘氏力稱：「檢察處在超出合理懷疑之外，不能證明各被吿有罪，本委員會值可作一決定，即駁回原吿之訴，將各被吿宣判無罪」。裘氏之異議，立即引起判決是否確當之問題，蓋以三人委員會僅得三分之二票決定各被告有罪也。聞我代表團長朱世明將軍，及沈觀鼎，將訪晤美方艾其森，就澀谷案宣判事提出討論。沈氏更將就七月十九日射擊事件中有關日警察責任一點，提出，各被各始終不承認引起該項臺胞六人喪命及廿餘人受傷事件之首先放槍之責任。日警出庭作證時，把所耗於該决事件中之槍彈，達五百四十二發之多。據三人委會主委宣稱：該案將交由佔領當局審核，我駐日代表團於澀谷事件發生後，一向堅持進行完全及公正之調查，我代表　之不斷努力，欲使台胞受公正審物，並使發生摩擦之兩造責任，得以追究明白，但關查日警責任一事，迄今猶未完成。</p>

<h3>一警士投函鳴委屈</h3>
<p>第一函　我們都是站在光生門前或樓下的警察，我們的家人，都爲着所得的薪津微薄而在　寒着，在疾病着，……而我們呢？在寒風冷雨中，在冰天雪地上，在酷熱的太陽下，拼命的奔馳，忍耐地站着自己的崗位，所爲的是什麼，有了火警，有了盜匪，我們耕命的搏鬥，逮捕……所爲的是什麽？有少數陰謀者，想藉着這次攤販事件而製成慘案，我們用自己的生命去維護着八民的利益，所爲的又是什麼？</p>
<p>我們固然不敢稱功，說我們已經盡了我們的責任，而我們讓家人在挨苦在怨艾，我們自己在忍耐在拼命，實在是因爲要使自己負起一部份國民的責任，來保獲社會地方的安寗，所以雖然苦一點，精神上亦覺得稍爲安慰。</p>
<p>但有人說：「警察應是服務人民，而不應有管理人民的心理。」難道我們這就不是服務人民而是管理人民了嗎？難道我們應該服務於不良份子或少數人，由他們不顧一切的搗亂或妨書了大多數人的利益或安寗嗎？</p>
<p>我們爲淸大多數人的利益而流血，……試問那個同情了焦頭爛額的我們呢？不特沒有同情·撫慰·反而遭受了部份人士由不理解而至的謗罵？</p>
<p>先生們！試設身處地想想我們將會如何的憤恨，如何的難　所以我們要呼籲，我們要悲鳴，因爲我們受了屈辱？因爲我們受了不合理的批評，呼籲，悲鳴　要求賢明的先生們給予一點公平的慰籍！（高橋警察分局一個長警代表）</p>
<p>第二函我是一個警察，又是貴報每日必讀忠厚的讀者，在十一月份貴報登載公教人員加薪的好消息，照原薪加三倍，現在我仍舊每月只拿到十萬一千五百元。公正的先生們；我們非但未加餉，通每月應發的五斗黃糙米（十月十一月份）還未發給我們，在物價在漲的現在，十萬元的待遇，怎樣叫警察們能修維持生活呢？再公教大員配售軍毯，非但不配售而且信息全無，不知當局在計劃什麼呢？配售配給是很好聽的要爾登呢，每套須十二三萬元，請公正先生們想想，假使我們買一套的話，至少一個月不吃飯還不夥，假使真有便宜貨配售，我們那有多餘的錢去買呢？警察們是人民的公僕，保獲人民生命財產安居樂業，但是我們這樣的生話，公正先生們；給警察們一個同情啊！（李耀祥）</p>
<h3>公務員乘車應優待</h3>
<p>本年九月間，市參議會會議及公教人員免費乘軍一案，時至今日猶未實施，公教人員待遇非薄，盡人皆知，無待　述，每日上下班單靠一二輛交通車，限於時間，限於路綫，要使散居四處的公務員，都接送無遺，絕難辦到，故能享受乘坐是項交通車者，爲數極微，大多數皆自乘電車或公共汽車。在車票昂漲的今日，此一問題，每一公務員，都感到嚴重，所幸英法商電車公司都有優待公教人員乘車辦法，出售月季票，每張一萬元，使窮苦的公教人員，着實受憲不淺，但是電車路綫不能達到的地方，必須乘坐公用局公共汽車，公共車旣屬市營，照理應更優待，可是事實完全相反，市府暨所屬各局職員乘車時，一律須照章買票，絲毫不能短少，而對於同業外商電車公司員工乘車，在互惠條件下，則無　而購票‘公務員固應絕對守法，乘車當然要買票，惟目前物價在漲不已，月入僅十餘萬元，仰事俯畜，責在一身之環境下，車費之支出幾佔全部收入三分之一，如何能負担？公共汽車與外商電軍組織及性質迥不相同，更應盡可能爲公教人員謀取福利，我們不再痴心妄想參議會免費乘車的實施，祗要求公用局迅飭公共汽車公司自一月份起，援電車公司例，發售公教人員乘坐公共汽車月季票，即受賜多多！（小公務員）</p>

<h3>柯孚海峽英艦觸雷事　英致阿國最後通牒　要求道歉保證不再有同樣事件發生　兩週內無滿意答覆將向安理會申訴</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕此間今夜發表：英政府爲英艦在柯孚海峽無故被襲，因而發生生命及財產損失事，已向阿爾巴尼亞政府提出指辭強硬之最後通牒，限其於十四天內正式向英道歡，並要求賠償損害。如不獲滿意答覆，英政府將向安理會提出該事。首决事件發生在五月十五日英巡艦「奧里翁」號及超等號於經過海峽時爲阿國海岸砲台發砲射擊，幸未受損。迨至十月廿二日英驅逐艦「蘇馬萊土」號及「伏拉傑」號又在海峽觸水雷受重傷，官兵死者四十四人之多。在兩次事件之間，商輪經過該地亦時被射擊，英政府照會指出英掃雷艦於十一月間在該處掃除水雷，發見此等水雷實係英驅遂艦出事前不久始敷者。由　國海岸戒備嚴密一點觀，若在海峽黨設水雷，決無不爲阿國當局所知之理，故英政府訊爲此等水雷，或係阿國所自敷設，或則阿政府必知有數設之事。因此，阿爾巴尼亞政府實已嚴重破壞國際公法。英政府茲特要求阿國政府，爲英艦先後被襲事，正式向英政府道歉，並保證不再發生同樣事件。英政府復要求阿國政府賠償英艦於十月廿二日所受之損失，並向死亡官兵四十四名之家屬支付全部撫卹金。阿政府若不於照會送達之日起十四天內提出滿意答覆，英政府將視阿國此項行爲，爲對於國際和平與安全之嚴重威脅，而向安理會提起吿訴。該照會係於昨日遞交貝爾格勒之阿國公使館者。</p>

<h3>聯總舉行全體大會　重視今後救濟工作　賴迦第亞爲聯總工作辯護　謂分配糧食從未牽涉政治</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕聯總歐洲部份本月底結束，建東部份明年三月底結束，聯總四十八國代表今日在此舉行全體會議，署長賴迦第亞竭力爲聯總分配食物事辯護，謂凡以聯總分配糧食時曾施用政治手段爲言者，絕非正確之論。余絕不知糧食分配時曾經牽涉政治一項。賴民追述聯總一切糧食之運送均係由九國管理委員會決定，據稱，余未聞任何政府因糧食分配牽涉政治而表示反對。賴氏此項聲明，係答復副國務卿艾克遜星期日之聲明，艾氏曾謂若干國家獲得接濟太多，若干國家則太少，此乃重大錯誤一云。</p>

<h3>調查各國軍隊案　聯大會一塲爭辯　裁軍問題商定九項原則　小組會起草報告書交大會討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕英國代表無克魯斯今日在聯合國全體大會中，促　蘇聯外長莫洛托夫贊成對於國外以及國內軍隊之調查計劃，謂吾人不妨聽任事實公開，掀起帳幕，觀看全世界各國之究竟，藉以祛除猜疑。余要求蘇聯勿進循孤立政策，造成猜疑。簫氏並稱，莫洛托夫實反對其自身之提議。按政治委會以卅四票對七票通過軍隊調查案時，蘇聯曾表示異議，謂調查國內軍隊人數問題僅與普遍裁軍案有關。　先是，，美國代表康納利亦稱，一吾人並無秘密，吾人當以全部兵一力向世界公開，希望他國亦能如一此，但康氏重行聲明反對英國提案由安理會派遣調查團，實地覆核駐軍人數之報吿。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕聯合國大會今日繼績討論調查各國軍隊間題，蘇聯代表同意由國際機構負責調直各國軍隊惟建設必須同時調查各國軍備，包括原子彈在內，即將調查軍隊與調查軍備併爲一案。英代表「原則上」已贊成蘇聯所提辦法，如此議得獲大會通過，則美國勢必將其原子彈秘密即行付諸公開。目前主要爭執點仍爲否決權問題。英代表堅持負責調查各國軍隊及軍備之國際機構，應不受安理會中否決權之約束，蘇代表主張則與此相反。大會主席史巴克宣稱，如此議經大會通過，則調查各國軍隊及軍備之整個機構至明年一另十五日即可成立。</p>

<p>〔合眾社德黑蘭十一日電〕據值開入亞塞爾拜然省監視選舉之政府軍隊，已佔領米安納，據來自該城在首府大不列士西南，距大不列士使二百公里。亞省前綫之電訊稱：政府軍與亞省民主軍嚴發生劇戰以後，已佔領米安納之消息，可能認爲確實。倘該城已被佔領，即政府軍已前進三十哩之謂。該電訊又稱，蘇駐伊朗大使沙契科夫對伊朗政府之軍事行動，向總理蘇丹納提出強硬抗議，指賣伊朗政府違背諾言，派遣軍隊入亞省，足以威脅蘇聯邊境。據稱伊朗總理不斷受蘇方之監力，欲其停止軍事行動。國會選舉頃巳在伊朗其他各處開始進行，但亞省一地之選舉將俟政府軍力能控制投票時，然後舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕英外交部發言人重申前言，聲明伊朋軍隊在其本國境內調動，純屬伊朗政府之內部事件。該發言人否認外傳伊中央政府派兵入亞省，係由英方供獻意見之說·記者復　以若亞省戰爭爆發，英政府是否仍認此乃內部事件？答曰，英政府當然認伊朗境內之動亂，應由伊政府解決。</p>
<h3>蘇表示關切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教十一日廣播：蘇聯報紙今日一教表示對伊朗內戰之關切，並謂美方已以轟炸機四〇四架，協助伊朗政府軍隊進攻。</p>
<h3>原子電力廠</h3>
<p>兩年後在芝加哥出現</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社芝加哥十日電〕美國科學家曾參加原十炸彈製造者蒲爾東教授，頃在此閱發表談話稱：利用原子能之第一電力站，可望於兩年之內，開始供給電流。至於芝加哥全城，概以原子能所發生之電力供給，則須在十年之後。</p>
<h3>埃新閣困難重重　社會部長拒不就職　開羅治安不靖情形緊張　英埃談判前途難以樂觀</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅十日電〕此問最近投擲炸彈及縱火等情事層出不窮，當局爲此，特於本日命令警察局，凡有任何形跡可疑之人，徘徊公共塲所，部長及高級官員官邸之前，均可開槍，格殺不論。此外又悉：諾克拉奇內閣總理領導組織之新內閣，因新任社會部長亞羅巴堅決拒絕接受部長之職，故本日未能在國王法魯克面前，宣誓就職。據亞羅巳談一人徵詢余之意見，故不能予以接受，余在前內閣常拒絕與英國簽訂協定，現仍堅持此種意見。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕負賣政治觀察家稱：就埃新總理諾克拉奇之就職演說觀之，英埃兩國對於蘇丹未來地位意貝之不同，勢將繼續存在。諾克拉奇曾謂其內閣將領導蘇丹人建立自治政府，並永遠在埃王治下與埃統一。此問人士認爲此乃對於貝文—薛特基所議英埃草的蘇丹部份之正式解釋。然不允蘇丹人有獨立，而使某永選與埃及合併之觀念，已先後經蘇丹總督赫特爾斯登及倫教外交部加以拒絕。英政府旣無放棄其立塲之趨勞，故料貝文—薛特基協定恐難作爲英埃修約談判之基礎。</p>
<h3>强吻費文麗　被判徒刑兩月</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕二十八歲之大學畢業生溫生，於名影星費文麗偕其夫勞倫斯下汽車時，趨前企圖強吻費文麗，並毆擊勞倫斯及在旁之兩警官。經拘捕提起公訴後，被判三毆擊罪，各處徒刑雨月，合併執行兩月。溫生在庭聲稱：渠與奧爾特維克公司的定在劇中袒任某角後忽被辭，想係勞倫斯故意與其爲難。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫教十一日廣播：英下院今日對印度問題，發生激烈爭論，勞倫算首先赶　致詞，謂目前談判尚在進行中，不宜對此問題開始辯論。旋艾德　致祠，作同樣之表示，最後反對黨邱吉爾致詞，力主印度問題應立即加以辯論。</p>
<h3>法總理難產　第三次投票又延期</h3>

<h3>對日索取賠償計劃　美否認決定减少　日即將宣佈五年經濟計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日專電〕美國務院人員今日否認外間所傳美國要求日本賠償數量之最後計劃，較鮑萊所建機要求於日本工業者爲少。據稱：賠償討劃迄仍在預備階段，目前尚未有最後決定，較鮑萊計劃或多或少，尚不可知。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十一日電〕　　日日人方面消息，關於定期在日會報吿鮑萊所提之日本賠　計劃一事，已無限期予以延期，籍以進免引起國際聞反響。據稱：日本政府誠恐因此使各國認爲日本已擬於賠償條件正將宣佈時，要求予以減輕。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十一日電〕據此間消息靈通人士稱：日政府即將公布一九四五至一九五〇年度之經濟建設五年計劃，該項計劃將以煤斤與水電發電之生憲爲很據，規定在一九五〇年出產煤斤三百五十萬噸，即等於一九三七年度之百分之八十。日本各界領袖深信日本之前途醫於工業與對外貿易，而不在於民主。目前之重大問題爲賠償計劃，鮑萊之賠償計劃，給予日本經濟前途以淸楚的概念。</p>

<h3>美艦隊司令　論未來戰爭　北極固屬重要　海岸亦應重視</h3>
<p>〔聯台社紐約十日電〕太平洋登陸戰專家第四艦隊司令巴培中將今日暢論未來戰爭之趨勢。據稱，美國將來倘遭大規模破壞武器之襲擊，數小時內或將死傷五百萬人。但敵人不能一下將我擊倒。數小時內，吾國將實施大規模之報復攻擊。美國對於大規模破壞武器之製造，至少較他國進步十年，但吾人必須買進不已。軍事上之進步，乃爲聯合國成功幕後最有力之保障，他日一旦戰爭倘再發作，絕非君子間的决鬥，而爲文明大眾之存在問題。一般人重視穿越北極前來之攻擊，下知理由何在，余以爲外國自數百哩外大西洋散處地點派遣十餘艘潛艇及原子彈至美國東海岸各城市，更有可能。火箭式之原子彈，甚至於潛艇沉沒後，仍能發射，但吾人之報復亦將敏捷，敵人無法避免，且受更大損失。</p>
<h3>中國與印度（中）</h3>
<p>— （尼赫魯著）</p>
<p>本報駐印記者　周祥光譯</p>
<p>玄奘吿訴我們很多那蘭陀大學的情形，其他紀載亦同前幾年我曾到過那蘭陀大學，見廣多遺物從遺址中有計劃的掘出來，引爲驚異今日僅有一小部份向無發掘出來，仍然是人民居留之地，但這些地方，依然包括着廣大庭園，被石製而成的莊嚴屋宇圍繞着。</p>
<p>當玄壯在中國圓寂後不久另一旅行者義淨和尚來到印度。他在公元六七一年從中國啓程，途中足足走了兩年，始到達印度的德拉立的港口，就是胡格里河的口上。因他由海路而來，並停在巴鄰旁（在蘇門答臘），研究楚文若干時月。這决海路的航行，他是具有深意的，或許由於政治局面的變動，而使中亞細亞的情狀不靖以致不能由陸路而來，若干佛教的僧舍，在途中各處，爲彼輩止步安息之所。海路或亦更能適合印度在印尼殖民地之增長，並且使印度與其他國家發生經常商業關係。從義淨及他人之紀載上表明，當此之時，在伊朗，印度，馬來亞。蘇鬥答臘與中國間，有經常航行，義凈即是乘波斯船，由廣東而初决到了蘇門答臘。</p>
<p>義凈亦曾在那蘭陀大學研究，爲時甚久，並且帶回去數千百卷之梵文經典。他的主要興趣在於佛教禮儀及規儀方面之要點，且他曾紀載這些事情非常詳盡，他復吿訴我們關於衣，食及習慣方面亦多·北印度方面之主要食品爲麥，如現在一樣，東用印度以食米爲主，肉類雖有時食之，但亦鮮見。琪油牛奶等物，則隨處可以見之，而餅干水菓等則甚多。義爭紀載着印人極重要之事，是依恃於某一種特定之宗教禮儀的淸淨「現在第一件最重要的分別，在五印度及其他國家間，就是宗教禮儀之眞誠奉行與吾。而且：「食物遺留下來，若在中國可以貯藏此却未必與印度律例相符」。</p>
<p>義淨曾談到印度。謂爲西方，但他自己吿訴我們，印度是名爲Aryadesha　Arya之意義爲爭。Desha之義土，爲爭土一各爲西方。其所以如此稱謂者，因其人之性格表現，都是尊貴淸爭，並且所有民人亦以此名而贊揚斯土。印度又名爲中土」Madhyadesha因共地處百教國家之中央。一切人民對於此名倍覺親近。北方夷族（如胡，蒙古人，突厥人）獨日呌凈土爲印度，但此畢竟不是一個普通名詞。這不過當地沿用之名，並無特殊之意義·印度人民並不知道這個名稱，對於印度最適當之名稱，則是「淨土」。</p>
<p>義凈的論到身毒，是非常有趣的。他曾說：「有些人說，印度Indu之義爲月，中國人呌India爲印度，係從此而來，雖然其義或許如此，但這非普通之名。抑若印人稱中國爲支那，道不過祇是名稱，並無特別意義」。他亦述到梵文對於高麗及其他國家所稱之名。</p>
<p>義凈對於印度至爲崇敬，並對印度之事物亦物亦然，他對於此類事情紀述詳盡，並首先給予其母國—中華。印度或係「淨土」，中國却是神州」。「五印度之人民對於自己之真誠與尊貴，頗爲自負。但祟尚思想文字涵養，雍容正態度，平中氣概，迎送禮儀，食物調羹之有味，仁慈公正之胸懷，則祇能在中國始得之，他國則吾」。針炙術之醫治及按脈感覺之巧妙，如印度任何地方所不能取而代之，藥劑之延續生命，亦祇能在中國見之…從人之性格與物之質言之中國名爲神州·在五印度中之任何一印度，能不崇敬中國乎」？</p>
<p>古代梵文對於中國帝王之稱謂爲Deva—Putra，俱確之譯義爲「天子」。</p>
<p>義淨本人就是一個梵文學者，他稱譽梵文，并且他亦說過在南北之較遠的國家，亦祟敬此種語文：更有若干神州（中國）與天堂（印度）的人們，教授這一語文的典則：梵文學者之在中國，必定普遍已極。我們覺到有趣的，有若干中國學者，想將梵文的音符用到中國語文裏去。一個最好的例子，就是中國唐朝儈人漱文，想將中國語文，按照此種方向，成爲字母拼音式。印度佛教寰微，中雖常有朝山者從中國來參訪印度的佛教聖地，但實際兩國學者之交往，已吿斷絕。當公元十一世紀間，政治革命之進行，所有佛教僧徒皆携梱經典，走向尼泊爾，或越喜馬拉雅山而至西藏。古代印度文舉之重要部份，我們先前已知道到了中國與西藏，近年來已經在那邊原本元全發現，譯本亦屬頗多。好多印度古經典，不但有關於佛教者，而且，有關於婆羅門教，天文，算學，醫慶者，仍保留於中文及藏文關於這種學者聯係之事，迄今仍存，最好例子，就是梵文，藏文及中文之佛教術語辭典。此書作於公元第九或第十世紀間，各曰大辭書Mahavyutpatti。</p>

<h3>陸京士召集紡織工人代表　商談年賞分配問題　勞方表示讓步希望仍依照往年辦法　社會局將召集工商領袖舉行談話會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會部組訓司司長陸京士，昨日下午會的集棉紡織業工人代表，假社會局會議室就年賞問題交換意見。陸司長吿記者：工人方面以棉紡織業利潤甚甚厚，希望能有六個月薪　之年賞；但貨方則認爲紗價已受限制，利得有限，几賬面上雖廉錢，如以物資計算，並未增加，不能接受勞方之要求。勞方經其勸吿後，已願作相當讓步，但最低希望仿照往年之辦法，將工人年賞分成全年所得百分之二十，二十五，三十三等，組工得百分之二十，管理人員得百分之三十。所謂全年所得，乃指扣去假日後之實際收人。本人相信棉紡織業勞資雙方之間，必能和衷共濟，在維持生產保護勞工之原則下，對此問題獲得協議。又據勞方人士表示：昨日之會議爲非正式交換意見，勞方巳將其觀點儘量提出，以供參考。陸氏明日即返京，定本月二十一日再來滬，屆時棉紡織業之年賞間題，當可有具體之快定。</p>
<p>又悉社會局長吳開先，定本月十三日（星期五）下午四時，召集本市總工會，下業協會，市商會等各常務理事，舉行談話會，業己發出通知，希屆時均各出席云。</p>
<h3>討論救濟失業　延期下週召開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局本定昨日開會，商討救濟失業工人方案，臨時因故米能開成，決定延期至下星期一召開。據該局李副同長劍華吿記者：工人招待所原定招待工人一千餘名，但目前實際收容人數已在一千八百名以上。因過於擁擠，環境衛生大受影響，致在十一月，工人之兒黨因天花而致死者達十餘名。下週開會時，將討論如何改善該所之醫藥衛生設備，及此筆經費之措籌間題。至於失業工人之安插，李氏認爲治標辦法爲使已開工之廠能够維持，未開工者使其早日復工。治本之道則爲改善整個國民經濟，以增加就業之機會。</p>
<h3>巡邏視察禁建區　婉言勸告拆棚屋　五處空地百餘畝準棚戶租用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市禁建區內正在搭建之棚屋，經市政會議機決取締後，市工務局於昨日起奉令會同警察局開始巡查執行。</p>
<p>昨日上午九時，兩局特組機巡邏隊，由工務局取締科科長宋學勤及警察局交通科科長陸俠，率領警察及工匠各六名出發巡視。巡邏人員在出發前，特由工務局局長趙社康召集訓話，矚各員務須以誠懇和善態度勸解棚戶居民拆除，並須吿以拆除之原因與大眾之利害關係，及善後處理，決予居民以出路。巡羅隊上午至長寗路及凱旋路，，下午赴楊樹浦及蘇州河一帶視察。以楊樹浦一帶所建較多，其他各路情形尚佳。巡查人員見少數棚戶正在蓋屋，即加以闡述取締之事，棚戶居民態度殊爲良好，均允於二三日內拆除。昨日隨同前經之工匠警士並未勒令拆除，但予以警吿，如限期不拆，則決代拆。</p>
<p>同時工務局趙局長昨日上午特價營造處處長王元康親白至長壽路，西康路，餘姚路，宜昌路及江寗路等處視察。該廠以餘姚路（即舊新加坡路）建屋者最多，中區棚戶多數係造在馬路內或弄內。趙局長今日仍將親往楊樹浦區視察。記者昨特走訪趙局長，詢渠關於處理棚戶辦法，承吿目前禁建區內尚未完工之棚戶決予取締，今其至非禁建區內蓋搭。同時根據都市計劇，業經市府核准轉飭地政局微購建造平民村之私地五處，共計一百六十三畝，計有：楊樹浦飛虹路二一畝，蒲淞區曹家渡四五畝，滬南區天鑰橋四〇·八畝，浦東楊家波一五·六畝，滬南區肇局路四〇·八畝。該項土地原擬列入明年預算中備建造平民村。但在經費無着前，空地可准棚戶擇地租用。</p>
<p>該局前在南市大木橋建造之平民村一百餘幢，現除由少數市民租住外，餘皆爲市府職員住用。又據趙局長表示如欲配合都市計劃，房屋建築必須區劃。工廠附近希望設建宿舍，則房荒間題即可減輕多少。住宅，商業各區亦常劃分。趙局長昨並視察本市瓶頸形凸出房屋，對於此項問題，將於下决市政會議內付之公議。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於本市之修路工程，昨據工務局長趙祖康向記者表示二現時本市之幹路修築工程，已全部吿竣，計烤魚成十二萬平方公尺。修築支路工作，目下亦己積極展開。依照該局之預定目據，自本月一日起，至明年二月止，三個月之間，將修竣支路十萬平方公尺。已完成者，有梵是渡路，林森中路，復與中路等；即將動工者，有雲南路，山東路，廣西路，虬江路，西藏北路，乍浦路等。據稱：若明年度市府所撥下之修路經費充沛，則自明春四月至十二月間，可將市中區，包括英法租界區域內之爲路，全部修竣，至於全市道路，包括郊區在內，或亦可望於二年之內加以修竣。</p>
<h3>發動冬令救濟金　潘議長率先倡導　市參議會開始勸賑</h3>
<p>邇來寒氣襲滬，昨更竟日風雨，凍餒交迫之貧民，日有死亡，市府雖已積極籌款，惟究屬有限，未能遍惠貧民。市參議會議長潘公展，有鑒於此，認爲須策動全滬市民羣起協助，始可奏效。昨特函參議會命協助政府積極發動冬令救賑事宜，以期達到爲民服務之主旨。潘議長本人並率先侶導，將參議會中所得車馬費五十餘萬元，全部捐賑。茲悉該會業已照辦，並擬於今日起開始發動勸賑事宜，更冀各法團共同進行，以襄義舉。</p>
<h3>孟姜女演出美滿　蔣夫人茶會招待贊助人　梅蘭芳批評演技　費希盛讚劇情好</h3>
<p>蔣夫人宋美齡女士，昨日下午五時，假勵志社第二招待所舉行茶會，爲籌募國民革命軍遺族母校復校基金，招待孟姜女歌劇公演上海贊助人。到外賓費希及吳市長夫婦，方治，徐寄慶，吳紹對，宣鐵吾，黃仁霖，魏景蒙，奚玉書，丁貴堂，劉攻芸，徐學禹，曹俊，梅蘭芳，王泊生，鄧士萍，郭琳爽劉靖基，章榮初，沈德爕，王兆槐，章楚等二十餘人。時值大雨滂沱，夫人準時蒞會，與來賓一一握手寒暄，情緒至爲愉快。賓主略進茶點後，夫人首向梅蘭芳博士，及國立戲劇學校校長王泊生分別徵詢對孟美女歌劇內容之批評·二氏認爲除表演技術上尚需略事改進外，劇情方面含義甚深，頗能表現中國文化之一部分。</p>
<p>繼總幹事黃仁霖報告略謂，此决孟姜女歌劇在滬公演，承各界熱心勸募，業爲感謝。就連日公演之情形觀察，全部收入可能達到四億之數，各位贊期人中，特別是杜月笙，錢新之，徐寄康三位先生協助最多。梅蘭芳，王泊生二位先生指導最動，才能獲得如此成績，誠屬機會難得。十日夜場已告滿座，本定十一日晚閉幕，爲滿足觀眾興趣起見，特在十二日加演一天，並將日塲票價減爲二千，四千，夜塲票價減爲五千，一萬，以便普通市民均能觀賞。黃氏報告畢，蔣夫人致詞</p>
<p>蔣夫人繼起致詞稱，孟姜女歌劇在滬公演成續很好，本人不但代表遺族學校對諸位爲我們的遺族子弟壽募教育基金，表示感謝，同時對於中國的文化能藉孟姜女歌劇，向國外介紹，增進國際間了解之機會，望覺意義深長，衷心至感快慰。孟姜女歌劇上演後，本人曾與委員長觀演四次，覺該劇內容，比一般舊劇，改良甚多。馬歇爾將軍對該劇亦感興趣，常常談起，足證該劇如往國外公演，亦可吸引不少觀眾。</p>
<p>贊助人意見旋由各贊助人一一申述對改良該劇之意見，歸納可得下列數點：（一）音樂須與動作配合，（二）扮演孟美女之主角，年紀嫌老，（三）神鬼混雜一起，動作零亂，（四）化裝要改良，以辨善惡。最後夫人向外賓費希徵詢意見，渠謂，劇情很好，希望能到美國華盛頓，紐約各地公演。夫人表示贊同，旋由黃總幹事作結語謂，各位如此熱心贊助，不但在文化工作上，有了很大的供獻，間時對於遺族學校的特來，也奠定了基礎，謹向各位表示極大的謝意。賓主暢談至六時許，始盡歡而散。夫人於散會後，由黃仁霖陪同，在招待所內各塲）巡視一週，始乘車返東平路官邸休息。晚八時三十分，夫人復往南京大戲院觀演孟姜女，興趣甚濱，終塔始返。</p>
<h3>劇團負責人表示出國時將減人數</h3>
<p>又據中靑音樂劇團總經理鄧士萍語記者，該劇自十一月六日起曾在京勵志社公演九日，觀眾甚多，票價分一萬，五萬二種，收入共一億餘元，十二月五日起來滬公演，票價分一萬，二萬，五萬三種。全部收入，俟演完後始可結算。成績大致不差。惟劇情內容及表演技術上缺點尚多，希望社會人士多予指導贊助。本團無不衷誠接受，切實改良。記者詢以全部演員人數共有若干，渠謂演員計三十五人，運劇務在內共的六十人左右。將來如出國公演，仍當盡量設迭減少。</p>
<h3>宋院長公畢返京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕宋院長自來滬與銀錢工商界洽定生產貸款，及消滅棉鈔黑市之方案後，當於昨日下午二時，與秘書副官一行，乘中航機返京。</p>
<h3>玉佛寺內會晤太虛　佛門戒殺法師黯然</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕寒雨中，梵唄起處，玉佛寺更見得靜蕭而莊嚴了，</p>
<p>松月師引我們走過了一條走廊，在大雄寶殿的後側面，一座靜靜的　堂前停下。他搶前走了一步，笑着吿訴我們：</p>
<p>「這位是太廠老法師」。</p>
<p>太虛老法師穿着綜黃色的佾衣，白絨襯衣的袖口伸出在袖口外面。戴上一頂絨線帽子，也是深綜色的。玳瑁開邊的眼鏡後而是一對慈祥而愉快的眼睛，含笑看着我們。他伸出了豐腴而修潔的手，歡然一握。我們在舒適的沙發上坐了下來。松月師坐在旁邊的椅子上靜靜聽着。</p>
<p>佛們戒殺，而當前正將有大規模自相殘殺的戰爭進行，當然就不期而然的談到了時局了。老法師似乎躊躇了一下，慢慢地說，「國民黨自廿六年以來，終於抗戰勝利，共實，應當是可以全國休養生息，安定一下了，誰知道——偏偏的協商又是得不到成果，弄到這樣田地！」</p>
<p>老法師俯下了頭，不禁點然。</p>
<p>佛教徒組黨</p>
<p>我們換了一個話題：「最近又盛傳佛教徒組黨的說法，大法師的看法是怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>『我在覺羣週報第一期會談過這個問題·中山洗生說，政權是全國人民的，儈侶常然也是人民，應當願問政事。我們可以參加選舉，到參議會，省議會，或者國民代表大會——不過組黨的事，我倒不大這樣主張。」</p>
<p>太虛法師對佛教教育，一向是非常關心的，在重慶，他會主持了規模開大的海藏教理院，對邊疆一帶，起了相常大的作用。</p>
<p>談到西藏的佛教，我不免就想起了密宗，因爲諾那活佛在上海的種種奇跡實在太奇怪了。法師說：密宗的確是有些奇怪，不過倒的確是大乘。有些奇怪的事情可以說是「術」，不過海藏教理院所研究的是「教義」，是「學」。</p>
<p>靜安寺事件</p>
<p>晨後，我們談起了大家很注意的靜安寺事件。</p>
<p>太廬法師搔了搔頭，已經滿頭都是銀絲了。他堅決地說：</p>
<p>「我看這件事包括兩個部份。第一個部份就是德悟密迦兩個人被檢舉爲漢奸的事情。老實說，這兩個人要算漢奸嗎，却實在還有些不够。要照這樣在敵偽時期參加過一兩次人民團體的就算是漢奸的話，恐怕淪陷區裏還有四五百萬人該被檢舉了。第二個部份是靜安寺和寺裏的一點產業，該怎樣管理的問題。我覺得以前寺院裏的管理制度，到了現代，已經不大適宜了。我在重慶辦的海藏教理院，以前本來是一座荒廟，因爲廟裏管理不善，破壞得很利書，後來教理院辦起來，成立董事會管理廟產，另請專人負責院務，便得到了成績。我以爲靜安寺的寺產，也可以組織一個董事會來管理，另外在寺地辦醫院，或者圖書館，或表學校，另請專人負責管理行政上的事務——可以辦作由佛教所辦的一種業務。這倒恐怕是比較妥善的辦法。</p>
<p>論六根和尚</p>
<p>靜安寺現在是由六根負責的，但法師顯然認爲目前的辦法並非根本解決。他說：「將來德悟他們回來，一定還會有糾紛。六根是一個朽庸無能的人，民初他也主特滿靜安寺，可是他來之後就從來沒有辦好過，訟累始終未休。所以根木上管理的辦法，要謀所以改進了。」</p>
<p>法師今年以經五十八歲了，近年來因爲血壓國高，所以文章也不能多寫，話也不能多說。不久，也許要到寗波去一次。明年在南京開的全國佛教會，也是法師主持的。</p>
<p>離開玉佛寺時，幕色在雨絲中已十分蒼茫了。</p>

<h3>薈萃各地代表舉行一週會議　基督教大會昨圓滿閉幕</h3>
<p>全國基督教協進會第十二屈全國代表大會，於本月三日在滬揭慕後，壓時一週，昨已圓滿閉幕。此次出席代表遠及東北九省，爲十餘年未有之盛會，英美及加拿大各先進教會，均派代表參加，商討如何協進計劃，并謀派遣新經訓練之專門技術人才一百人，於來年蒞華協助一切建設計劃，其中包括音樂家，科學家，教育家，社會工作等專家，各組建議案甚多精闢。該會並爲響應主席昭示從事精神建設，特定明年開始發起全國三年奮進運動，集中一切人才，物力，促使奮進運動之成功，提高國民精神之生活。其他建議案，有歡迎傳教士來華協助事工，加緊訓練人才，提高工作人員之待遇，及充實進修之辦法，加強各種事工之合作，注意協助國民教育之推進，開展邊區之工作，以及籌劃基督教日報之發行等數十案。該會並即於閉幕前選舉梁小夜爲曾長，江長川，崔憲詳，趙紫震，鮑哲慶等爲委員，大會除發表宣言外，並上電蔣主席致敬。</p>
<h3>煤斤供應已改善　來源積極疏通中　安南白煤將有六千噸運到</h3>
<p>據經濟部上海區燃料管委會負責人稱：爲防止本市煤斤黑市起見，自本月份對工廠配煤方法加以改善，即前按月各工廠需要數量，皆由煤業公會代會員申謂，現改爲由工廠直接將實際需要量具單申請，由該會審核後配給，一方可以配合工廠需要加緊生產，另一方則避免公會從中操縱，再則可使黑市價格自然趨降。白煤方面，預訐十五日可能由安南運到六千噸，又據有把握方面前向安南古拔煤礦廠洽定相富數量，如無意外波折，每月可有六千噸運華，月底可先到一批。塊煤方面，戰後各國缺貨，商人自由採購爲數工多，該會前已向美國洽購一萬噸，如該地船員風潮平息，即可運到。至分配方法，當另訂之。</p>
<p>解除煤荒　端賴開源</p>
<p>該負責人繼稱：爲解救目前煤球原料困難計，除保特經常供給原料外，木月份再加添白煤小塊二千噸交煤球業公會補充原料，關於消除一般黑市問題，仍盼地方政府盡力協助。該負責人末稱：解除煤荒，端賴開源，其中最主要者爲交通問題，按照過去三月至九月各處到貨，均臻理想，十月及十一月份則成績欠佳，在能力範圍之內，當儘量設法加強。除開　方面每月維持十四五萬噸，台灣五萬餘噸，分配谷地交通水電機構，及工廠等，現資委會對於煤斤生產異常注意，預計明年度東北可生產五百萬噸，并可以五分之一運供關內，一俟明春葫蘆島解涷，即可開始。至每日能出產白煤一千噸之焦作煤礦，已經國軍克復，積極生產，該地存煤的十四萬噸，惜自焦作至新鄉，鐵路未及修復，又以道路漫長，火車運輸困難，現已設法向聯總行總當局商妥，俟由產地運到新鄉後，改由卡車陸續運出。</p>

<h3>八一三戰前失蹤案醜劇主角　宮崎貞夫在日本出現　在國內經過了十年監禁才復自由</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕最近日本傳來的消息，說是宮崎貞夫這個人又出現了。</p>
<p>宮崎處夫是誰呢？</p>
<p>民國二十六年七月二十四口，那時正是七七事變發生後十七大，離八二二還有九天，上海正是空氣最擊張的時候。突然，在那天晚上十點鐘，有兩個日本軍官到狄司威路捕房報吿，說是當夜日本陸戰隊歸隊點名時，少了一個一等兵，這一等兵的名字呌做宮崎貞夫。</p>
<p>日軍一方面要求當局調查，一方面，陸戰隊立刻派士兵四出放哨，斷絕交通，檢查行人，情形非常緊張。</p>
<p>那時代理上海市長俞鴻鈞，就通知日本總領事岡本，請其鄭重行動，不要再刺激人心。</p>
<p>但是，日本太國方面怎樣呢？</p>
<p>東京各大報都用特號大字記載消條新聞。日本軍艦紛紛開進吳淞口，領導的正是「出雲」艦。</p>
<p>到二十六日，情形才安謐起來，人心漸漸定了。</p>
<p>然而宮崎貞夫的下落却仍舊不明·</p>
<p>日本領事館還在張皇失措的天天開會，可是突然之間，在靖江縣八圩港江面，忽然撈到了這個宮崎貞夫！</p>
<p>下面，是摘錄宮崎在警局裏的「自述」，他在文後還打了手印：</p>
<p>「在二十四日下午九時左右，我一人到靶子路一家妓院裏去了，到九點半，付了兩塊錢想走回去，有好像是中國人三人追來，向我再要討錢。爭了半天，我就坐人力車向和平塔走了。但是我從妓院出來的時候，會給一個日本水兵着見，他親眼看見我和這三個人爭吵，而我在爭吵的時候，因爲身穿軍服，怕給他們認出，所以把軍帽領軍都棄了才坐人力車到和平客。過了和平塔後，我用報紙把軍服包了起來，避了二夜。到二十六日淸早，就坐了英國船逃走。在船上，我是睡在甲板上的，船員說要報吿艦長，我因爲無票乘船，不勝恐懼，所以在二十六日下午一點，就跳下船去，投人長江。那時，船巳經到了靖江。二十七日，被人救了起來。」</p>
<p>靖江縣就把他送到江蘇省政府，二十八日下午，這個人被送到了外交部。外交部就把他交還給日軍當局。</p>
<p>可是，到了日軍手裏的時候，日軍覺得大大的失了面子。這場醜劇的主角立刻被捕，說是犯了什麼侵佔物賣的罪名，把他送回國去，一直監禁到最近才釋放出來。</p>
<p>宮崎貞夫在監裏過了十年，日本軍部似乎以爲已經遮了羞了。</p>
<p>這就是常常自誇爲「武士道」國家裏的「武士」行徑！</p>

<h3>行總科長移用公款案　偵查完畢·提起公訴　吳燧人貪污罪　京署函述吳對舞弊似早有準備</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總總務處出納科委吳燧人，將公教移用放債生息案，已經地檢處劉用之檢察官偵查元畢，茲以貪污罪提起公訴。</p>
<p>按吳燧人利用職務上之便利，將行總九月份經費廿七億元，移用放債生息，十月二十八日經署方發覺，吳即表示悔改，並將全部公款廿七億連同利息所得一千四百六十萬元送還。行總雖未遭損失，然移用公款已觸犯刑章，行總署長霍竇樹乃於十一月十六日將全部案情函送地檢處請依法辦理。該處受理後即出拘票於廿七日淸晨將吳燧人扣押，偵查至今起訴。</p>
<h3>另三筆匯款　發覺亦可疑</h3>

<p>首傳陳妻訊問，陳妻着黑色海虎絨大衣，紅圍巾，黃色高跟皮鞋，二十八歲，渠稱：與陳默在二十六年結婚，去年十一月遷入愚國路愚園坊四十五號居住，屋內陳設之沙發係向萬墨林借用，紅木桌椅係向蒲石路蔡興泰木器行購買，王一亭畫四幅係錢金根贈送，乾隆年問摺扇係於三十三年廢曆正月初十左有，在成都南門外武候祠，以六千元由字畫攤上購買者，有蔡德培司以作證。</p>
<p>要求對質</p>
<p>繼傳陳默審訊，陳着咖啡色駝絨袍，黑皮鞋，入庭時與家屬點頭，站被吿欄裏，面露傲然之色，供稱，原任忠義救國軍先遺總隊長，在去年九月十日左右去職，現做進出口生意，去年八月因先遣軍都隊無處可住，經唐生明之介紹，住入李逆土羣宅內，至八月底部隊奉命開至瀏河集中，，即離開該宅，並非前往查封，此事可查詢李逆妻葉吉卿，梁逆鴻志住宅不知在何處，陳逆羣住宅係軍統局所住，否認乾隆年間摺扇爲粱逆鴻志所有，所供購得摺扇經過情形與其供妻述相同，庭上以中美合作所檢舉函兩件交被吿閱看，陳辯稱：檢舉人吳永淸不相識，最好請其出庭對質，供至此，庭上命陳默坐一旁，遂傳證人蔡德培證明。</p>
<p>商人作證</p>
<p>蔡機培稱：前在成都華西大　讀　，現在上海經商，二十八年與被吿在香港認識，會在三十三年廢　正月偕陳默反陳妻同進武候詞，　擊其在字畫攤上購買摺扇一柄，一面爲山水畫，一面爲字，竹骨、長的一尺；稍覺破舊。</p>

<h3>蕭瑟五金舊貨業　不堪回首滿庭坊　鼎盛時期已成陳迹</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「金玉里」，「滿庭坊」，這名稱是够美麗——美得近乎諷刺，走進一所牌坊式的大門，是一條骯髒黝黯的里街，沿着那潮濕的石子路走去，向西一折，穿過一　暗沈沈的茶館，「金玉里」就完了，接着是「滿庭坊」，不是滿庭芳華，而是些晦暗的，生了銹的黃銅白鐵。這兒雖稱爲坊，其實是一條狹窄的街道，西達石路，東通西上麟街，短短的一條街道裏，治門設肆，擺着許多廢銅舊鐵的攤子，這些攤子，和小銅匠挑的擔子差不多，面積比較大些，由東到西，大的有二十多個。有的人，因爲沒有生意，兩天或許休息一天。</p>
<p>設攤歷史　逾四十年</p>
<p>道兒是有歷史淵源的，據攤販說，遠在四十年以前，這兒就擺設着攤子了，起初是香燭和五金，慢慢的香燭業衰落了，五金却越來越盛，由少而多，以微致顯。有的由攤販而變成店主；有的由小攤擴充爲大攤；有的由幫傭而改成獨自經營；有的高飛遠走，變成了五金業的巨富。總之，這兒的人們，是父子相傳，師徒相授，經過了四十年時代的興衰消長，「滿庭坊」之名却確立了。那攤販從袖筒裏伸出手來，指着對面的一家五金店說：「那家店本來也是攤販，後來改成店了。」我看一看那家店，門面狹小，器物凌亂，然而比起攤販來，總算傑出的了。那店老板或許會感到驕傲，經過了多少年的努力，他總算置下了這一份家業，雖然這家業，在現在看來，依舊免不了不景氣和衰落。</p>
<p>零零碎碎　花色繁多</p>
<p>這兒的貨色大致都是零零碎碎的，譬如巨大的鋼鉗，小巧的銅鎖，鎚子，鐟子，鐵桿，銼刀等……還有機器零件，車輛材料等，因爲凌亂雜燕，由攤販來賣，比較最適合，有眼光的人，到不妨去掏掏的。一架廢置的機器，也許在這兒配到一樣廉價的零件，可以重新便用；一部破車子也許在這兒得到它所需要的東西，而再度行駛了。然而這都是過去的話了，現在這兒變成了非常冷落，那攤販對我說：「您在這兒待了半天，可看見有一家攤子做成了生意麼？」的確，不但沒有做成生意，運過問的人都沒有，即使有人買去一樣小零件，在他們也是九牛一毛，他們的希望是把所有的貨色一起出淸，改就他業，偶然賣掉一兩樣，他們並不滿意，也許倒是記者來和他們談談，他們得以藉此訴訴苦經，來得高興些！</p>
<p>勝利到來　存貨貶值</p>
<p>三十三年起，在敵人搜刮廢鐵的時期，似乎是他們的興旺時期，他們的貨色不在搜括之例，物稀爲貴，他們在那時候着實發了一筆小財，可是勝利以後，偽幣二百作一，存貨貶價，營業也就立刻衰落了！</p>
<h3>外輪來滬　勢將增多　應付碼頭倉庫擁擠　港務會決妥善準備</h3>

<h3>澈底消滅棉紗黑市　具體方案原則已定　政府供給外滙但須以紗易棉　棉紡公會今日討論實施方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕宋院長爲澈底消滅棉紗黑市起見，昨日上午十時，再度召見紡管會吳兼主委，王啓宇，吳味經，榮鴻元，榮一心諸氏，共商具體方案。聞原則大致業已確定，茲探誌大要如决：（一）原料方面；（甲）組設原棉分配審核小組會，由婦管會執委會分配處處長李餘，及國民營紗廠代表各一人分任委員。（乙）在原棉許可輸入限額之內，准由各紗廠自行分配。（二）成品方面：原則上規定以紗易棉。換言之，政府供給購棉之外匯，同時按議價收回一部份之棉紗。如有餘額，仍歸各紗廠自由買賣。（三）國民營各紗廠營業一元化。除紡建公司原巳恢復掛牌制外，民營廠方面開紗事宜，應集中六區棉紡公會辦理。仍由該公會組織配銷委員會，掛牌開紗（四）每决開紗前，應將各支紗就其品質，種類。在低於市價之原則下，議定其標準價格。議價時應採機動万式，可按市面需要，及本身之存紗量，予以伸縮酌定。</p>
<p>第六區棉紡公會，當秉承宋院畏之意旨，於昨日上午十一時，召開常務理事會議。出席王啓宇，吳味經，榮鴻元，唐星海，劉靖基，郭瓊等。常將宋院畏召集會談時所決定之原則，作成方案，以便提出於十二日下午三時召開之紡管會常會上討論，同時並研究施行細則。</p>
<p>據某關係人士吿記者：政府此次開放美棉結匯，共輸入許可之申請，將分季（即三個月）辦理。照目前我國棉紗之生產量估計，每季輸入許可之限額，約爲廿萬至卅萬包。屆時爲提倡國棉計，政府當將根據申購美棉之數額，搭配一定比例之國棉。又據觀測：如以紗易棉制付諸施行，政府以能供給紡織業所需之大量原棉，則政府當亦能因此而易得大批棉紗。雖尚有餘額，供各廠自由買賣，惟究佔少數。故預料紗價前途縐勢，必穩無疑。同時今後開紗掛牌，國民營各紗廠採取同一步驟，議價又採機動方式，故預料棉紗黑市，當可因此根絕。</p>
<h3>市場傳言孔多　美鈔黑市激漲　金價亦被帶高</h3>
<p>烚赤昨平穩多盤，晨開二八五萬，開後續有殘多了結，而吿不支，逐漸下游，低價再降至二八三萬五，央行即以三八四萬之價，配給一四〇條，十時後，低後漸穩，逐步由實銷方面吸納，擁有餘資者亦有追購，供源稍止，午刻回升至二八六萬五，午後外幣劇昇，謠言助買，央行隨市有壓，是以隔日交判僅吿盤漲，最後升至二九〇萬大關，較前收漲起四萬五，飾金掛高至三〇萬四，紋銀平銀元稍低，暗拆銀根尚平，息價仍在一角二至一角半。</p>
<p>外帶昨稍轉堅，港幣缺少供應，仍見秀色，美鈔暗市自五〇〇〇元起，午刻在五〇五〇元左右徘徊，午後又傳匯率更動，突起爭買，最後竟抬高至五二五〇元以上，較前收漲二百餘元，港票存底有限，經絨線帮及西商等求，急切上升，竟騰六十元，港匯一〇一〇元，英匯一六二〇〇元，印匯一二二〇元，午後均無賣價，成交極少。</p>
<h3>公債交易稀</h3>
<p>公債昨仍盤旋，交易忽稀，祗有百餘萬元，成交由五樓三六〇室稍購，而五三三室則稍納雜牌，統丙晨開一一〇〇元，低價一〇九〇元，高價一一四〇元，結果較前收微挫三十元，甲乙戊各升三十元，統丁則漲六十元。</p>

<h3>人造絲疲落　綢貨前途暗淡</h3>
<p>人造絲一二〇號有光因乏受主，故黑市昨又疲落四五萬元，高山做三百十六萬元，尚無成交，天橋價仍喊上日原盤，半光及一五〇號有光亦未變動。廠絲昨市有二十餘包交易，八十一分Ｃ字等級做價四百〇二萬五千至三萬元，七五分Ｅ字等級陳貨做三百八十五萬元，新貨做三百九十萬元。干經仍無交易，綢貨前途黯淡，市價不到成本，總因交易不旺有以致乙。</p>
<h3>茶銷毫無起色</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市英商出口行需求之高擋陳祁門，在吐納談判僵持下，交易依然寥落，而市勢則仍平定，他若抽珍珍眉等綠茶，品質低劣者，脫手猶極艱難，高擋貨舊價奇昂，過程均淸，茲悉午昌茶葉公司對於本年度新珠茶及新珍眉，復見垂靑，刻下已與賣戶在磋商中，至於紅綠茶內銷，續鮮起色，人心頻趨悲境云。</p>
<h3>青糖軋缺</h3>
<p>昨潮靑以號貨暫吿斷缺，故刁靑號方呌升數千元，較高開九萬八千元，次之九萬六千元，汕次赤十萬〇八千元，廣帮簿片靑八萬二三千元，興化白十三萬三千五百元，至十三萬一千元，次之十二萬四千元，興赤十三萬元至十一萬八九千元，公會劃盤現貨中砂白十三萬三千五百元，生砂赤十一萬八千元。</p>

<h3>麺粉廠難維持　因原料缺乏限價不夠成本</h3>
<p>本市麵粉工業，僅次於棉織工業，全市麵粉工廠，擁有大磨四千八百只，小磨一百零二只，馬達一百十四部，馬力一萬二百匹。目前因電力限制，產量大減。據該業鉅子談稱，該業生產一面受電力之限制，不能全部開工，一面則受原料之限制，蓋其麵粉所需麥子，我國產量不足，多賴國外輸入，月前各國均限制輸出，故來源益成問題，倘此後外麥再無輸入，則明年度恐有數廠將停止開工，此外該業製造成本甚高，而限價低廉，廠方維特亦感困難云。</p>

<h3>廠屋作爲抵押　有關機關在研究中</h3>
<p>國家銀行舉辦工業貸款，對於押品一項，限制甚嚴，機器廠屋均不能作爲押品，使工業界甚感困難，曾先後呈請政府當局改善工貸辦法，本市中國工業協會頃奉經濟部電知略謂：查國家銀行辦理工貸，均屬低利貸款，數額並無限制，關於押品方面，最近四聯總處已決定機器亦得作爲抵押品之一部份，至於廠方地產應吾充作押品，有關機關正在縝密研究中。</p>
<h3>米市無甚變化　雜糧較有生氣</h3>
<p>米市南北共到一萬三千餘石，市勢依然早緊午懈，仍難生色，南粳結果無甚變化，麵粉趨勢亦頗軟化，麩皮照常萎疲，豆餅台總略有交易，回漲一二百元，黃豆本街納取，油廠揀巧拾收，市形站立，茶豆南洋去化續辦，價格步挺，再加千元，蠶豆胃呆出神，紅糧再入下游，回跌千元，苞米甚俏，無貨應市，生仁廣方動而不旺，趨市平庸，芝蔴高貨稀少，廣帮納胃甚強，形成高削决平之狀，油市近因天氣轉冷，生油大多凍結，銷路不爽，回小二三千元，市況盤旋，豆油零化尚殷，並無軒輊，蔴油已成跌定之狀，亦少榮辱。</p>
<h3>絲織業要求貸款　總額六六〇億元　每臺織機抵借千二百億元　正呈請政府當局予以援助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電織絲織業以處境困難，已呈文行政院，財政部，經濟部，及四聯總處，要求政府在貸款及定貨方面，予以援助。在貸款辦法上，該業之具體要求爲：</p>
<p>一·寬放貸款數目及抵押辦法如次：</p>
<p>甲，貸款總額的計六百六十億元，按織機每台貸放一千二百萬元。（約計織機總數共五千五百台）</p>
<p>乙，每臺織機及設備抵借六百萬元，機面半製品抵借四百萬元，織成品抵借二百萬元，合計如上數。（倘機面無半製品或機成品不足數者按實扣算）</p>
<p>丙，借款用途</p>
<p>（一）淸償舊欠高利貸</p>
<p>（二）添購原料</p>
<p>（三）發付工資及其他繳用</p>
<p>除上列三項外不得移作別用</p>
<p>丁，利率按照絲繭貸款成例，按月二分二釐行息。</p>
<p>二·接受國營機關定貨援照同業放料代織慣例，由國營機關發給原料，定製適合外銷標準之綢貸，其詳細辦法另以合的規定之。</p>
<p>在定貨方面，該業公會建議中信局所存廠絲，交由該業之工廠加工製成，運銷南洋美加等處，以開拓海外市塲。呈文中並指出：中信局配售之人造絲，每箱定價爲二百八十萬元，而政府與日本易貨之價格，照香港市價每箱僅五十餘萬元，獲利數額每箱在二百萬元以上。截至目前爲止，廠家巳購用者，有　產處理禺之五千四百滿，中信局之四千三百箱，合計政府獲利已達二百億元。故國家行局此時如能放數，實屬「取諸同業，用於同業。」股後並表示：如不蒙核准，則工廠除倒閉之外，別無他途，惟有將全部廠產機械及二萬餘工人職員，一併移呈國家，妥　着後。</p>

<h3>洋松方子暢銷</h3>
<p>木材市況，因洋松本月份到貨頗少，現洋松方子，市價告漲，聞外埠有工程動工，向滬市搜購方子，故市氣正盛，杉木仍在低檔盤旋中。</p>
<h3>首批日紗即播運港</h3>

<h3>國大教育界代表胡適等提建議書　請政府注意教育問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕國大自由職業敎育界代表胡適，曹芻，葉溯中，葛爲　，楊展　，黃造雄，陳白，周斐成，蔣建白，周厚樞，王子玗，王義周，　通和，朱經農，陳錫芳，梁賢達·章益·阮志道等十八人，建議國民大會，請政府注意目前有關敎育之重大問題。原建議　，探誌如下：查敎育爲立國之本，亦爲施行民主政治之基礎。當今憲法正在制定之時，政府即將還政於民，尤賴敎育之普遍推行，以使人民有行憲與行使政權之能力，除憲法上對於敎育應有包涵性與適應性的規定，俾使國家基本政策得以推行無阻外，對於當前敎育上重要之事項，不能不略抒同人等之所見，以供政府在敎育設施上有所採擇，並冀社會關心教育之人士，寄予同情，一致主張，促其實現。</p>
<p>延用專才增進效率</p>
<p>第一，政府對於教育應延用專才辦理：敎育在近代已成爲專門學科，敎育事業在一般社會尤且專業性質，故辦理敎育之人員，必須具有專門之學識與經騐。目前從事敎育行政與敎學工作者，缺乏學識與經騐，一般人仍多以爲敎育行政與敎育事業人人能辦，敎員亦人人可當，故雜流並進，成績未著，而敎育遂亦不被重視，此等錯誤，必須立予糾正，政府必須愼重任用各級敎育行政人員，敎育主管當局，必須注意延用與所辦敎育有關之專才，中小學敎員，允應任用曾受師範訓練者充任之，俾敎育效率得以增進，而敎育之使命亦庶可逐漸一達成。</p>
<p>敵偽產業撥充經費</p>
<p>第二，政府對於敎育應撥巨款積極辦理：抗戰時期，敎育文化，最遭破壞，，勝利以還，敎育文化之復員則進行最爲遲緩。社會上旣未能廣泛援助，政府亦未能盡其全力，在整個經濟系統中，若干人士往往祗見敎育之消費，而忘却敎育對國家未來之供獻，致使多數被摧毀之學校，無法恢復，應添辦之學校。無法添皺，無數兒童靑年流浪街頭，無校可入，其情形至爲嚴重。中央應高瞻遠矚，視敎育復員及添辦學校、爲責無旁貸之舉，立撥巨款補助各級公私立學校復員並添辦新校，以收容失學兒童及靑年，以挽救目前之頹勢。又各地方敵偽及漢奸產業，並應撥充教育經費，蓋敵偽產業，大都由剝削人民而來，用之於敎育，最符合人民之願望。</p>
<p>縣教育局提早恢復</p>
<p>第三，政府對於地方教育應提早恢復縣敎育局並大量補助：縣以下地方敎育，以敵偽之破壞及受裁改科財政統收統支之影響，致地方敎育行政頓形紊亂，普及敎育之推行，進行亦致遲緩，原有敎育經費之獨立精神，亦破壞無遺，並經大量挪移別用，例如戰前地方敎育經費百分之四十或五十以上者，現在則降至百分之十左右，原有敎育經費本不裕餘，試觀地方敎育現狀，學校設備簡陋，不足供敎學之用，敎部待遇低落，月入四五萬元，至不能維持其個人生活，優良敎員紛紛改業，不合格人員在六十餘萬各敎師內，佔三十萬以上，甚至小學畢業即充小學敎師者，亦有八萬餘名，其嚴重情形，不言可喻。今後一面應令各省於三十六年度起，一律恢復各縣敎育局，一面應恢復地方敎育經費保障制度，務須專款專用，一面地方國民敎育經費，中央應增多補助，至少須負担四分之一，以期早日普及。</p>
<p>獎勱私校予以補助</p>
<p>第四，政府對於私人教育事業應力予扶植補助：查目前我國學校數量私人所辦渚實占公立學校三分之一以上，可見私人所辦敎育，對於國家敎育事業裨益甚大，勝利以還，私人敎育事業，政府置若罔聞，若干優良私校重建無力，政府並未有切實有力之資助，此實爲敎育上一大缺陷。私立學校敎職員，同爲國家公敎人員，而亦未享受國家同等之待遇，甚願政府對敎育事業，不分公私，同樣重視，予私立學校以獎勵補助，並予私立學校敎員以同等待遇。至在抗戰中被毀私立學校，仍欲設法復校者，允願政府予以切實有力之資助。</p>
<p>教員待遇迅即提高</p>
<p>第五政府對於教員應提高其待遇：敎育人員，不論從事國民敎育或其他各級敎育，均握國家新生之樞紐，近以物價高漲，生活艱難，各級敎員俱感痛苦，允以國民學校敎員爲甚，敎員不能溫飽，敎育效率從何而言？目前各級敎員之轉業及退避者，已成普遍現象，若不積極挽救，實可造成極嚴重之後果，至希政府具最大之毅力，下最大的決心，迅即提高敎員待遇，俾能適合當地實際生活之需要，並隨生活指數之增加，而予以增高，俾能安心而專業。</p>
<p>被佔校舍嚴令發還</p>
<p>第六政府對於被告用之校舍等應嚴切督責發還：勝利之初，秩序未定，部隊及行政機關，佔用學校及文化機關國體之房屋者甚多，迨秩序恢復，敎育應同時復員，但被佔用之校舍等，往往久假不歸，至若十學校，不能早日恢復，政府雖有通令，實未能澈底執行，甚盼政府嚴令部屬，認真辦理，立即發還，毋使教育界萌生怨望之心。</p>

<h3>大學球賽裁判問題</h3>
<p>好教師應該是好裁判</p>
<p>本星期六，大學足球聯賽，復且戰滬江，將再度角逐，而塲地與裁判，均已更改，第一次比賽時，雖然參加毆鬥的，不是球員與栽判，然而追究糾紛的起源，裁判技術的生疏，是不能諱飾的。各校體育主任首次會議時，陳陵即曾聲明，去內地十載，對足鐵裁判已不熟習，難免有錯。而出席會議的其他主任，則認爲大學體育負責人，而不能祖任裁判，是一種汚辱。復旦體育主任沈昆南，亦認爲一個好體育指導，不一定是位好裁判，反之，一位好裁判，却不見得是位好體育敎員。所以一塲球賽，對於裁判之是否稱職，廳於事前作愼重之考慮。前天記者晤復旦章益校長時，章校長亦認爲大學球賽，應該請裁判會裏的人來做裁判。但是，我們希望在大學任敎的體育負責人，除了敎導體育外，也願該注意裁判的事宜。固然「好教員不一定是好裁判」，但「好教員應該是好栽判」。在目前大學體育正在展開聲中，我們總不該有異議罷。</p>

<h3>無錫工業在不景氣逆流中邁步前進</h3>
<p>— 本報記者丁維棟</p>
<p>三個臺柱子　紗廠·麺粉廠·絲廠</p>
<p>無錫工業化的程度，在京滬綫上僅次於上海，工業用電的數字，足以證明這個事實。戚　腰的發電廠每天輸送八千匹馬力的動力給無錫工業，數量不能算低，但是電力的　饉依然是一個問題。大工業的動力是勉強有了，許多戰時興起的小工業，不得不以相當高的代價，自行裝置發電設備，而據電廠的工程師估訂：要滿足無錫工業的全部需要，恐怕再要增加每日八千匹的動力！而且這僅是目前的情形而已。以今日紗廠利潤之厚、加以錫人之勤勉務實。作擴充計劃者頗不乏人；在海外訂購紡錠者，今後一二年內將源源不絕的還來，如此生產力擴大，電力的需要更亟。我們如以此爲尺度，可以看出無錫工業化的前途，實是未可限量！</p>
<p>無鍋工業的台柱有三：紗廠，麵粉廠，絲廠。這三類工業，因爲客觀環境的關係，今日榮瘁之　，相去懸殊。記者在短促的旅程中，與三業人士均有接觸，對於各業之困難與展望，有一大槪的了解，今試依紗業麵粉業絲業的决序，作一綜合的報導。</p>
<h3>幸運的紗業　只需經營得法無不獲利豐盈</h3>
<p>棉紡業在多難的中國工業中，今日無疑是天之騙子。需要量火而生產不足，黑市價高而原料相對的便宜，不管大廠小廠，只需經營得法，沒有不大賺其錢的。無錫的棉紗沒有限價，每包售價在二百三十萬元左右，紗織業的繁榮可以想像得之。至於鍋地之紗廠，其規模較大產量較多渚，有申新三廠等各家。請參看附表如下：</p>
<p>其餘的小型紗廠，有一二千錠子者，尙有十多家。上表所列，是各廠的設備最高數字，事實上，戰爭中摧殘甚多，若干尙在修理的過程中，今日開工的沒有這樣多，全無錫今日轉動的紗錠是多少？有兩種佔計：一是十萬錠左右，一是十一萬錠左右。這就是說現在紗的生產量，不過戰前的60％左右而已。在抗戰初起時，敵人佔領無鍋，他們對於妨碍「工業日本，農榮中國」國策的中國紡織業是深深仇視的。申新三廠的七萬錠子，被有計劃的破壞，留下的不過一萬錠子而已！至於一四七八台布機，更是破壞一得一無存餘。申新的遭遇如此，其他各大廠的命運亦相類似。但抗戰勝利一年後的今天，雖然國家多難，社會經濟動盪不安，記者已能目擊申新已能恢復到五萬錠子，織布廠在燒焦的廠房中開始裝備，十二月份可能有五百台布機轉動。工人和職員在輝煌的電矩下，一樣的熱情工作；其他的廠家亦都有明日的展望和期待。過去的遭遇似乎僅是一塲惡夢，一切隨勝利而消逝了。我深深感到中國人忍耐力生命力之强，是度過一切難關的最火憑藉。　無鍋紗廠的原料，主要是美棉，亦間有一部份巴西棉。在戰前他們已能生產四十支六十支的細紗，現在則機件受損，只能紡二三十支的粗紗。工人的待遇亦較各業爲佳，大概自八萬至三十二萬，技工頭子待遇亦可至五六十萬元。他們的工資依生活指墩計算，據一位在工廠的朋友吿訴我！大概是上海工資的八折。錫地的勞炎糾紛，遠較上海爲少，原因有兩：各大紗廠的主要技工，大多服務有年，共歷甘苦，相處旣久，漸生感情，即使有所要求，亦出之善意協商方式，很少以罷工的姿態出現。二是錫地不比上海，地方的情形較單純，對於工人尙無大規模的組織和操縱的企圖，故情况較爲安定。最近錫地工人，鑒於生活費高上漲，要求將底薪提高一半，此事資方將採拒絕的態度，故將來勞資關係是否能如以往，很難預言。至於技工的效率，一位廠主說，只有職前的七八成。並不是身體衰弱，而是心理上起了變化，覺得技工到處受人歡迎，「此地不留爺，自有留爺處」，因此紀律蕩然，敎能减退。記者平時深感以目前我國工業情况而言，除畸形繁榮的棉紡業外，工資的負担實將窒息民族工業；但今日要减低工資是談不到的，因此唯一的補救辦法是如何提高工人的責任感，使他們能自發的提高工作效能。</p>
<h3>麺粉業黯澹無光</h3>
<p>和棉紗業相比之下，麵粉廠和絲廠顯得黯然無光，後者且在原料斷絕的危機中。麺粉在戰前本爲無錫的主要工業，有名的榮氏家族本以麵粉起家，當年創業時所用的石磨一片，至今尙陳列作爲傳家之竇。在抗戰九年之中，錫地因敵偽統制食糧，發生一種畸形的繫榮，一時集資開麵粉廠者，不乏其人。今日該地有規模的麵粉工廠，當推茂新廣豐振華等廠，其他規模較小者，的在十家以上。目前的不景氣，主因有三：（一）動力的供應不足，使生產力不能全部發揮，但開支却沒法節省。據此業中一位先生的估計：現在錫地每天的產粉量不過一萬包，但如果電力足的話，可以提高到二萬五千包。這話是相當可靠的。在茂新二廠中，戰前每日可產粉八千包，現在則因爲缺電關係，產量銳减，第一天出五千包，第二天出二千五百包，週而復始，其他的廠家的情形差不多。（二）原料供給，過去大部來自蘇北，因共軍的佔據，供給不暢，影響生產。（三）目前糧食業普遍的不景氣，麵粉業亦非例外；結果是原料價格上漲，而麵粉的售價不漲，無利可言。在以上三項不利條件之下，今日麵粉業的生產，只有戰前的三四成。同時，租稅的負担，亦使工業萎縮。現在每一包麵粉要抽貨物稅四百士元，至年終尙有所得稅利得稅。一家粉廠廠長吿記者二每月租稅的支出，比較員工的薪給伙食費要大得多。在目前銷路不暢的情形之下，小廠深受高利貸之　，年關時可能有一兩家宣吿淸理。</p>
<h3>絲業危機　較粉廠尤嚴重</h3>
<p>無錫的絲業，其危機較之粉廠尤爲嚴重。該地在戰前，的有四十家絲廠，在抗戰九年中，又產生了二十多家小廠，一共六十多家工廠，僱用工人兩萬餘名。其設備較多者，見下表：</p>
<p>廠名　車數</p>
<p>八達　一五六</p>
<p>中絲六廠　三〇四</p>
<p>正貿　一〇四</p>
<p>永昌　一一四</p>
<p>金城　二七二</p>
<p>美新　二九六</p>
<p>永泰　三一二</p>
<p>鼎新　二五六</p>
<p>江南第一繅絲廠　三六〇</p>
<p>所有這些絲廠，一論大小，目前均在原料恐慌之中，如日繭運華不能成爲事實，則本月底前均將停工。到明年秋絲上市時，成本又將成爲一個最嚴重的問題。目前政府的收購價格爲每担三百八十萬元（標準絲），但秋絲的成本估計在每担六百萬元以上；他們對於政府扶助絲業的德意，普遍感激；希望將來的收購價格，能够按實際成本再作調整。至於生絲外銷問題，他們有一個共同的看法：就是我們絲的生產，有兩大弱點：業種不如人，故絲之品質亦差；二爲工資大高，故絲之生產成本亦高；在短期內，我們尙難和勁敵日本競爭。</p>
<h3>一個生產的城市　〔生之者衆·食之者寡〕</h3>
<p>無錫三種主要工業的現況與展望，已經略述如上。和其他各地比較，使人帶有希望。工業如此，商業亦然。當然無錫的商業亦是不景氣，倒風亦是有，記者到錫之日，一家大藥房給高利貸逼倒了，一家有十多年歷史的米店，負了七億的債，還在掙扎奮鬥，情形是够慘的。不過，無錫有錢的人們，把錢用來辦事業，而一不索來放高利圖享受，畢竟有很好的影響。因爲事業一創立，本一身就僱用了不少的人，他業亦因一經濟學上的所謂「倍數法則」，連帶的增加了繁榮，因此無錫失一業的情形比各地好。同時，因爲是個生產之地，人民購買力較强，故雖在商業不景氣的逆流中，市況還是不錯。至於無錫的農民生活，則今不如昔，過去他們每年有兩筆收入，一筆是米，一是蠶桑，生活是不壞的。一年以來一砍桑而種稻，誰知道米價的上漲也不能和其他的物價成比例！農民一年的辛苦所得，竟做不了一兩身衣服。我國現在經濟上的大矛盾是：提高米價，則工價必漲。工廠將不能維持；反之如不提高米價，則百分之八十的農民，生活不準日益降落，購買力薄弱，商業亦不能繁榮。我把這問題問過一位無錫紗廠的朋友，他的意見是：「過去政府努力平物價，而忽略了工價；今後當努力减低工價，才能解決問題。」</p>
<p>無錫是個生產的城市，而且是游手好閒之徒甚少，「生之者衆，食之者寡」，因此不止能够自給，還有多餘的物力外輸。其所以能如此者，夭然環境是一個原因，但主要還是人爲的努力。人民的節儉務實，着於利用厚生，終把無錫造成了一個「小上海」——一個有上海長處無上海缺點的生產都市。中國如果有三分之城市，能够集中人民的聰明才智，像無錫人一樣的向生產事業上發展，記者相信改善人民生活的目標，必能提早實現。</p>
<h3>進取精神　修復戰時創傷　力求擴充業務</h3>
<p>無錫的工業界進取心甚强，他們的最大優點是生活節儉，不事奢侈，將所有的賢力用於發展事業。現在，一般工廠都有發展的計劃，不但要修復戰時的創傷，而且力求專業之擴張。以紗業而言，不論大小廠，都在海外訂貨。例如申新紗廠，戰前是七萬錠子，，戰時損失慘重，現在僅恢復到五萬錠子，但是他們現在計劃增加到十二萬六千錠子！在戰爭結束的前夕，他們就向美國廠家定貨，明春預計可以運到一部份。其餘的紗廠訂貨較慢，而美國目前只有三個廠可以製造紡機，本身的需要亦大；因此在一年之內，無錫紗廠的生產量，不致有很大的提高。以麵粉廠而論，一時的不景氣，不足以使進化的產業家灰心失望，相反的，他們亦定下遠大的發展計劃。例如茂新二廠正在計劃購買機器，在無錫設立一所日出麵粉一萬包的大廠；同時茂新一廠亦正在增置英國戰時使用的新式磨粉機，出品成績特佳。這一切，可以看出他們的進取精神。</p>
<h3>動力問題</h3>
<p>動力不足曾限制了無鍚區的工業生產，這個問題正在順利解決之中。無錫電力之所以不足，原因不一，首先是過去十年之中，誕生的小工業甚多，他們都需要用電。其次是戰前各家大廠中，都自有發電機，都在這動亂的多年中，有的發電機損失了，有的　置而不用，道部份額外的電力負擔，影響了整個供需的平衡；至於戚駁壞的供電量，因戰時機件無損，並無絲毫减少。申新紗廠的發電機，現在是由電奢借用，發電供給無錫。但這樣還是不够，許多小工廠得不到電，只好自行發電；大的廠家用電量亦有限制，超過限額時須以煤供給戚　堰電廠，作爲補償。現在經各方面努力下，各大紗廠在明春可恢復自身發電，而戚　堰電廠亦可得行總發電機和英國戰時發電機的供給，電的供應能力亦將提高。所以無錫動力不足問題，二三月後可有圓滿的解決。而在過去和現在電力的支配調度上，戚墅堰電廠確是任勞任寃，費過一番苦心的。</p>

<h3>生命綫上第一要津　長春掠影</h3>
<p>— 十一月廿八日航訊　本報長春記者方仁</p>
<p>長春，現在是一位貧血病患者，是一位左癱右瘓五癆七傷的嚴重的病人，是一灘沙漠，也有人說是一湖死水。</p>
<p>土生土長　參議員敢講話</p>
<p>記者首先要感謝長春市臨時參議會的成立，它使我這一位會場上的旁聽者，在大應之內，總那些「口若懸河」的人，報吿他們年來實際生活的感受，嚴肅點說，報吿他們年來實際工作的情形。</p>
<p>長市臨參會是十一月二十二日正式成立的。成立之後，便繼續舉行大會。現在還未閉幕。這會共有三十一位參議員，他們中有八位是來自鄕間的，因爲長春有八個區是屬於市區範圍之內，而那裏却盡住着以耕種爲生的農人。也有工會選出的代表，他們的提案與質詢，無不把工人的事强調得比任何代表所代表的利益還要神聖。而小學敎師拼命把有關小學生的事說得天花亂墜。還有兩位銀鬚飄然者，硬說雙十節市府舉辦的男女中學生五百人大合唱，爲「有失體統」，男女混雜，太不雅觀。更有幾位毛頭小伙子，在通過提案時，當討論到破除迷信一點，於是高聲大叫，把作燒紙的工廠，把紮紙人紙馬的「棚戶」，完全勒令停工，原因他們是助長迷信之存在的元兇！　記渚要特別强調出這一點：議員中確乎有好些是未見過塲面的人物，他們不僅是土生土長在東北，還是土生土長在東北的農村中，然而，却敢於大胆講話。有一件是美中不足的事情：三十一位參議員中，沒有一位是女的，說也奇怪，旁聽席上的女公民，連日以來，竟也是寥若晨星。</p>
<h3>兩句口號　造產重於稅收　開源重於節流</h3>
<p>單靠稅收是不足爲法的，所以蕭仁樹局長提出類似「口號」的兩句話，作爲今天解決長春財政問題的努力的標準，那便是：「造產重於稅收，開源重於節流」。什麼叫做造產開源呢？據蕭氏的意見是：（一）開放生產事業，因爲長春在東北生產事業所佔地位，雖非重要，但却次要；而這些大部份爲市民血汗所貢獻所建立，所以應該拿出一部份來，爲市民大衆享受。比喻說，長春紙烟廠如果爲市府經營，則市府經費便可大有辦法，但是這工廠却被吉林省政府接收了。（二）房地產租金整理下，月入兩三千萬元不成問題，但是，屬於中央的，中央接收了；而不屬於中央的，則却爲房地產管理局所接收。（三）成立一個市銀行，可以使資金活潑點，不像國家銀行那樣，受到過多的限制，而市銀行由四行轉帖現，這樣自然可以使市面繁榮，市府經費自然也受其利。（四）整頓稅收，使市稅經徵情形可以涓滴歸公，自對市府裨益綦大。（五）成立交易市塲，使牲畜糧食等稅無從逃避。（六）善於利用善後救濟物資。（七）使物資流通，儘量達成貨暢其流的要求。</p>
<h3>警政改革　當局煞費苦心</h3>
<p>在東北，由於敵偽時期的影響，「警察」總是和「特務」混在一起呌的，而提到「警察」與「特務」的東北人都不禁油然起厭惡與憤恨。因爲東北人在「發察」和「特務」的手裏，以「思想犯」「經濟犯」等名義，使不知多少人爹娘見不到了兒女，妻子見不到了丈夫。他們是日本人豢養下來的創子手，是人間生離死別悲劇的造成者，是殺人不貶眼睛的魔王，是祇知有己而不知有人的大混蛋。</p>
<p>中央接收東北之後，最感頭痛的，使是新的警政的樹立。因爲要使東北老百姓把腦十轉過來，百先得盡量把所有過去警察的惡習，完全一掃而光，讓這般親民的警察，從新的行爲上，使人民獲得新的認識。</p>
<p>長春在五月底國軍進駐之後，對於警政的整飭，可謂用了相當苦心，除過七月一日起創辦警察訓練所，到現在業已施訓三期，共得訓後警察五百四十七人外，並實行日常訓練，每日施訓兩小時，並利用紀念週及各種集會施訓。但是在譬政報吿之後，各參議員都熱烈地起立質詢，說十一月二十四日，警察在侵晨巡遲勤務中，於西陽區空房附近，將一手持洋鎬折空房地板的老百姓傅書銘給槍打死了，警察說：因見傳某持物而來，「見景不佳，乃行開槍」，這實在犯着重大的草營人命的嫌疑。此外警察還在郊區鄉間受理民刑訴訟案件，隨便打人押人，把「婚姻田地」的事情，判得一踏糊塗。</p>
<h3>大鼻子兵的業障　形成少年夫婦間的苦痛</h3>
<p>在警政報吿中，有一件特意人人注意的報吿，那報吿是一個統計數字，那統計數字係經調查蘇軍在進駐長春後，長春老百姓所不願遭受到的一些事情。那統計是姦淫二十八件，燒殺五十三件，掠奪二千八百四十二件，破壞十六件，共爲二千九百三十九件。</p>
<p>就在臨參會開會的現在，長春竟發生了這麼一件事情，可謂離奇，也可謂是上面那些統計數字中之一稱的現身說法。</p>
<p>少年夫婦兩人，感情素篤，客冬某黑夜，破門而入一大鼻子兵，不山分說，對女的强行非禮後一他去。少年丈夫覺得此種「災禍」爲不可抗拒者，對妻子依然情好，妻子本憤不欲生，見此更使愛情增加，兩人愈形「恩愛」。不幸今年十月，突生一子，身體髮膚，多有異象，經醫生檢騐結果，證明澈頭澈尾爲一混血兒。少年丈夫不禁中心納悶，是否在强迫性行爲後可以受精？醫生答覆有可能性。但此兒若在膝畔，則又足引起夫婦間不快之感，頗想置之死地。友人勸告：小生命本身無罪，大可不必殺生害命，若果眞因此兒會勾起傷心的回憶，則把此兒贈給他人，也是辦法。</p>
<p>像這樣的事情，不一而足，這也可以說明東北同胞對某些人不愉快的原因之一了。</p>
<h3>十月政績　從頭檢討一下</h3>
<p>從今年「四一四」回溯至三十四年十二月二十二日，長春市府這一個階段，是在蘇軍佔領下從事接收從事推行庶政。在這個期間有四件可說。</p>
<p>（一）組織敵偽產業保管委員會。這個機構係由地方士紳和各機關團體由市府召集組成。共同負實保管敵偽產業，編制淸册，以免損失，準備轉交中央所派負專實接收的人。</p>
<p>（二）組織房產調整委員會。這個機構旨在保管所有敵偽房屋，免爲人侵佔，問時更注意分配一部份房屋，作爲平民住宅。</p>
<p>（三）防範貧汚。接收伊始，深恐不肖員司乘機舞弊，結果查出處長一人接收人員三人凟職，均予懲處。</p>
<p>（四）整編保甲。光復之初，戶口保用均無從談起。旣經接收，遂着手辦理，計有八十餘萬人，當時辦理情形相當薯成效。</p>
<p>自「五二三」迄今這一段，則有下述各點可述：</p>
<p>（一）遣送日僑俘。長市辦理此事相當著效果。東北遺僑俘工作開始於五月十七日，而長春則在國軍進駐後開始。長市遺走共二十餘萬人。</p>
<p>（二）實施保民與警察會哨。此爲冬防期間爲使人民力量與警察合作，辦理哨務巡查及戶口清查等事務。目前正積極推動中。</p>
<p>（三）平抑物價工資房租。關於物價工資房租悉採取議價方式，由各有關團體共同議定價格，再經市府核定實行。</p>
<p>（四）扶助文化事業。遵照中央命令，市民言論出版均極自由。所以長市報紙雜誌出刋者相當多。</p>
<p>（五）安撫靑年。與長官部前進指揮所在夏間協同辦一靑年暑期訓練營，收容松花江北來歸的靑年。並曾爲受訓中一部份人解決職業問題。</p>
<p>（六）整理市財政。遵照行轅指示，簡政减員，非迫切需要均予暫緩辦理。同時對市財政，力行開源節流。</p>
<p>（七）增進公用及衛生事業。改進自來水，尤注意飲水之清潔問　。市區電車及公共汽車，在兵　中破壞無餘，但經積極整修，已能使市區行駛車輛大有增加。疫癘之防止，允不惜人力財力着手力辦。</p>
<p>（八）加强敎育。長市不僅求學生數量上之增加，同時並爲提高師資水準，曾舉行敎師講習會觀次，而且强化師範學校。</p>
<p>（九）改進警政。改變警察觀念，取締高壓作風，提高服務精神，培養愛國意識。尤其爲　成長市洽安第一之要求，所以所有警政設施，主要多在配合軍事。</p>
<p>（十）淸理房地產及地政建設。過去房地產案卷，惜燬於「四一四」大火中，而現在接收工作，尙多未完竣，敵偽產業主權尙未確定，所以新設立地政局，今後當協同財政局專責辦理地政及房地產之淸理調整等事。</p>
<p>上面全是經報吿出來的工作成續，當然也有正在着手的，不過，十月政績，從這裏總可以窺出一些端倪。</p>
<h3>展望前途　長春自有千秋</h3>
<p>長春現在正在苦難中。但正因其如此，人看到了其「落寞」的現况。不免感想特多，責際，畏春自有其「千秋」。展眼前望，長春實在還有她美麗的未來。</p>
<p>長春位於九省中心，爲東北重鎭，爲偽滿首都，爲貫通歐亞中長路上重要的據點，一句話，是中國生命綫上的第一要津。</p>
<p>不過目前嚴重的事實，則在於市經費不足，以這樣一個洋洋大觀的都市，鬧窮鬧得一踏糊塗，如果在財源上不想到根本解決的辦法，則長春人竭盡全力，恐也無法保養此都市，無法使此以東北人民血汗建設起來的都市，經久不改其舊觀。遑言重新建設，乃至其他。所以，臨參會的參議員建議，改長春爲陪都，改長春爲院轄市，請行營進一駐長春等，與其從積極方面着眼，說是在求重建長春，毋寗從消極方面去看，說是求長春市財源獲得解決辦法，方爲允當·同時，臨參會上也報吿到：上海天津雖同爲院轄市，但同時都是市經費出超得厲害的都市，故長春之請求爲院轄市，當能獲得政院核准的吧。</p>

<h3>寫作的道德</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>最近本刊收到一籥稿十講到開明二十八年出版的一本「化學計算法」近來被人用一種巧妙的方法改頭換面抄製出版，其間把兩　分析比較頗詳，可惜限於篇幅未能登載，可是因此使我想到寫作者的道德問題。寫作本是一種很　苦的事，假使有人　　文爲生，那已是末路，若再有人偷竊剝削，那簡直是太無心肝了。</p>
<p>這又使　想到若十年前有兩家書店爲兩家所出版的英文敎科書相類似而打官司的事。有人說中國人有一個毛病，就是自己不知道努力創造，看見別人在某一方面略有成就或略　利潤的時候，他便起而效允，模倣，假冒。例如在上海就沒有人知道，那一家陸　　是眞的。所奇怪的是在中國文化水準較高的出版界也會發生這種現象。爲甚麼我們不能力求上進，精益求進呢？我們要設法撲滅這種投機取巧的心理。</p>
<p>中國出版界無論在物質方面或精神方面都是非常的　乏，這無可　言，所以我們一方面希望有資本的人從事於出版事業，政府設法加以扶持（例如放出貸款和免收出版物的營業稅等），另一方面在寫作者方面多多充實自己的內容，努力於研究工作，保持高尙的人格。至少我們要維緊最低限度的寫作的道德。</p>
<h3>太平天國史事日誌介紹一本信史</h3>
<p>— 羅鴻濤</p>
<p>郭廷以著</p>
<p>商務印書館出版</p>
<p>一千四百餘頁</p>
<p>價一萬八千元</p>
<p>太平天國之天京，於公元一八六四年七月十九日（即淸同治三年六月十六日），爲淸軍所攻陰。覆亡至今，已八十餘年，而關於此一大革命運動，尙無一完善之紀錄，此眞治史者之一大恥辱。今郭君此書之出版，適足以彌補此一大缺憾，實學術界一大幸事也。案世人對於太平史實，其看法的可分四個時期。自其覆亡後，內而淸廷上下，外而英法帝國主義者，共同作惡意之反宣傳，誣蔑太平軍，竟流寇草賊之不若。同時民間復造作種種想像爲之殘暴事件，此爲第一時期。及民元前後，革命之風氣已在波動，一般人竟認太平軍爲革命先烈。從而造作種種史料，（如柳亞子先生民廿三年八月二十日書云，石達開詩鈔祖本，出亡友高天梅手輯。其中杜撰甚多，大半皆天梅所偽造，蓋當時鼓吹革命，借文字爲宣傳利器也，可爲此說作一確證。）更有憑借想像，如洪秀全爲朱九　之徒，洪大全封天德王，錢江上書等等，似是而非之事蹟之產生，此爲第二時期。民國九年劉牛晨若自不列顚博物院，鈔印太平天國有趣文件十六種，自此以後，向海外發掘太平史料者日益衆多；程演生君自巴黎東方語言學校圖書館；蕭一山君自倫敦不列顚博物院東方部；王重民君自英國劍橋大學圖書館；俞大維君自柏林普羅士國家圖書館，咸有最大之收穫。（據學者之意見，上列四家中，以蕭君所得爲最多，俞君所得爲最精，俞君部份，承張菊生先生校正，輯入拙編太平天國詩文鈔中，惜今已絕版。（而國內之故宮博物院，亦有此項原始史料之竣現，百年秘藏，一且重見於人間，助長研究實爲不少，此爲第三時期。然研究太平史實，雖成爲史學家一時之風氣，而所得皆一鱗半爪，未有人能作全面之研究。有之，自郭君此書始。書首羅家倫君序文，謂郭君在此一問題默默無聞的費了上十年的功夫，才有這偉大的收穫。而郭君自視歉然，以爲此書爲工具一類的史事記，只求爲他人作預備工作，希望具有才識德學的史家，得此便利，可以有完全紀錄的產生。道是第四個時期。平心而論，郭君的工作在目下說，是成功的。</p>
<p>此書記事，開始於嘉慶元年，結束於同治七年。除專記太平天國及捻軍史事外，同時於此大　亂之背景，亦盡量記述，如嘉這兩朝之　動，各地民變，以及大地會三合會之活動，均在紀錄範　之內。所記事實，各方並顧，惟限於材料，軍事記戰，實居其大牛，祀載事實，以時間先後爲序。所記月日，係中西歷並舉，同時太平軍所行施之新歷，荀可考見，亦加附註。月日事實，力求正確。其涉有疑難者，則博採羣　爲之考釋，眞不愧爲優美之作。同時作者對於地方志認爲有若干重要資料，爲他處所不能見者故盡量採用。這是研究太平史者新開的一條徑路。雖然他能向淸華·中央·燕京。金陵四大學，及中央政治·北平·南京國學等圖書館，借得到參考書，有着良好的憑藉，可是他治壓的精神也是令人佩服的。</p>
<p>本書正文　　値得稱許，就是所附的八個附錄也値得介紹一下。</p>
<p>第一附錄，天歷與陰陽歷對照及日曜簡表。此種工作，在郭君前己有數人。可是天歷干支與陰歷干支並不一致，彼此相　一日。而太平日曜與西洋日曜亦不相符，亦提早一日。有此兩點之差異，前人工作完全　棄。而郭君此表，却是値得引用，保無錯誤的。</p>
<p>第二附錄，太平天國人物表，這簡直是一本小規模的太平史人物傳。前有爵職解說，有詳確之考證。每表分爵銜姓名籍貫經歷生卒附註等項，紀事　富，檢查便利，合於應用。</p>
<p>第三附錄，主要戰役將帥表。每一戰役記錄其主將部屬地域對方主將等。在太平軍方面共計十八表，在淸輩方面共計七表。這二十五稱表非將全部史實，網羅胸中，實在不能下筆。這是何等難得的努力。</p>
<p>第四附錄，洪淸兩軍戰爭地圖；共計十四幅。左圖右史，古所並重。我們有了此項地圖，　起史來，更能增進興趣。羅家倫君序文，亦謂附地圖的方法，是出於近代的觀念。若非近代技術的進步，是辦不到的。</p>

<h3>人文地理學傑構中國的地理基礎</h3>
<p>— 雋之</p>
<p>葛德石著　薛貽源譯</p>
<p>開明書店卅五年九月出版</p>
<p>地理與人生閱的關係，是最密切的。我們要瞭解中國的種種人事關係，可以說是需依賴於地理的研究，因爲由於它才可理解農業，資源，氣候，區域，人生各項問題的因素。</p>
<p>這本書的作渚葛德石敎授，僑居中國很久，經歷了十餘年的研究和旅行才得完成這著作；同時，這著作也正是他十年多的心血結成。著者在中國是任美國國務院文化事務局所屬的訪華敎授　，及美國全國學術聯合會，美國全國科學院兩團體的駐華代表；由於道許多方便，進行的研究工一作，反較我太國人爲佳。我們中一國的地理學者，絕沒有機會作這一樣長時間，消費不少資金來從事一研究。因之，作者雖爲美國人，一而這本書尙是我國地理學中一册一較有成就的新地理學著作。</p>
<p>在今天，這本著作無論是否地理學家，均値得一讀，正如作者原序所說：「中國現正處於空前的社會，經濟，及政治的調整中。一個素具孤立和守舊特性的大國，現在却很快　更始其生命，而成爲世界國家的一員了。若干由演變而發生的問題，地理學誠不能自詡都能加以解決，但對此演變的一些背景，則可得而說明之。」</p>
<p>社會的地理基礎</p>
<p>這册「中國的地理基礎」，是葛德石關於中國地理著作的總論部份，分地理量觀，地形，氣候，農民，天然富源，世界往來六部份來分別說明。</p>
<p>現在，我們試看它底內容：　第一章「地理景觀」方面，它指出中國的景觀上最重要的因素，不是土壤，植物或氣候，而是人民。這一點，我們是可爲信賴的，在中國道古老的土地上，很難找到一小塊地方沒有經過人們的活動渲染了的。　同時，作者也指出中國的自然孤立性，在過去的歷史上，中國周圍都有阻隔的障碍，而未曾和世界其他部份接觸，知識的交換也就很少；道是熱帶的叢林，高大的山地，廣大的沙漠，遠闊的海洋，共同保持了中國的統一和孤立。</p>
<p>湯姆士在「社會的環境　礎」中說：「現在普遍都承認，文化進步的最重要因素，就是多種文化的接觸，而所以產生停滯，則　若孤立。某一種　境足以按觸另一環境並供給一條通路，與另一區互相往來，必能　勵人民心理的可　性和文化的進步；反之，一個孤立的環境，必將引起心理的停滯和重複。」</p>
<p>由此，我們可明白中國科學所以落後的原委。</p>
<p>本章中另述及對比性的地方，劃出南方和北方的對照表，人口的壓力；並說明新舊交通，把各地汽車與公路例表計算。</p>
<p>作者在本章的結論，「理解中的中國」一段，因寫作的年代不同，所以有幾處是不正確的。但作爲一個參考，是極有價値的</p>
<p>氣候和農地關係</p>
<p>第二軍「地形」方面，它說明地質的　礎；中國誠然沒有歐洲和北美那樣的冰川特色，作者乃把我們的特質列舉出來，這裏不能一一爲之介紹出來。</p>
<p>此外，關於山地，河流，冲積平原，邊海，及中國版圖的變遷，作者均用了很充分的材料說明；並把中國各省人口與面積的調查列表以供參考。</p>
<p>氣候——決定人類活動的因素，本書第三章就講道問題，它述出中國氣候的物理性，這是受地形和海洋關係依次轉變而來的季風運行，偶然的熱帶氣旋，和一連續大陸性風暴，才產生出來的一氣候區，氣候與人生方面，一它也充分闡述，及風向的插圖，一平均溫度與平均雨量的表格。</p>
<p>第四章是關於「四千年來的農民」，當然，中國向稱農業國家，農業問題自最爲重要。本章，作者先說明晨　景觀，次再　到農業的基礎，及中國耕地的廣表，列表解說歷代的耕地與各省耕地，更將各省耕地與作物面積詳表報吿。作物產量也有表說明。</p>
<p>中國農業問題，時至今日尚　　　。作者指出以往中國農業問題　重性之一般。中國魚　科學化，需要社會的改造，目前時局的基本　結解除之後，當可踏上這道路。</p>
<p>天然富源的間題，，在第五章中討論，它先講歷史的背景；煤的來源及世界煤儲量，伸引出這最重要的動力——煤的開礦。接着就把煤的儲藏估計，各礦塲煤產量列表加以分別說明。</p>
<p>其他動力的來源方面，如石油。鐵及其他金慶非金屬之類，說明外亦附表；章來，說出中國礦物的生產，中國實業的前瞻。</p>
<p>展望中國的貿易</p>
<p>最後一章，是「中國與世界的往來」，作者述出其歷史背景，中國最　的向西遠征和貿易，是漢武帝時才始，至十九世紀時輸出貿易漸與，它列表　說出直接輸出外國的貨物，及對外貿易商品之比較。</p>
<p>織入貿易當然遠　於輸出貿易，這是鴉片戰爭後，國際資本主義打開了中國獨立自主的　　，而造成孫總理所說次殖民地的地位。本書作者也指出：「多年來有形的進口貨　是大大的超過出口的貨値。這種所謂不利的貿易平衡，近年來逾益利害。」</p>
<p>最末，它說明中國的　易　，以及各口岸對外的貿易。至此，本書乃吿結束。</p>
<p>讀完此書後，對於中國的　理，已具有一基礎認識的輪廓。故這本書是可作　習中的靑年，一個基本的認識。</p>

<h3>重讀〔父與子〕</h3>
<p>— 新俊</p>
<p>屠格涅夫著　巴金譯</p>
<p>文化牛活出版社　卅五年九月版三六五頁</p>
<p>在文藝領域裏，法國浪漫色彩的文學，是用那　麗地文筆，吸引了很廣的讀者。由此，我們想到：屠格湼夫道個著名的作家。他底小說，散文詩，都陶醉了無數靑年。屠格湼夫本身是俄國人，而且是貴族血統。但他在法國求學，因之，他的作品，逃脫不了法國浪淺主義的色彩。</p>
<p>格湼夫的作品，大都以蘇俄沙皇時代，靑年對舊勢力的抗爭作主題。但，他祗是側面地描寫，用他　練的文筆，「虛無主義」的靈魂，描繪出那些在文藝中不朽的人物。</p>
<p>「父與子」道部小說，描寫蘇俄農奴解放時代的新舊思想衝突，用他優美的筆調，通過了他底人生觀的三稜鏡而把它發展出來。</p>
<p>這部小說的內容大致講：</p>
<p>一個進步的地主，俄國貴族的後裔—尼可拉，他那由彼得堡大學回家的兒子—阿爾卡狄，這一雙父子，是中心人物。作者從他們二人的性格，發展出輝皇巨著。</p>
<p>阿爾卡狄是一個　無生義的信服者，授予他這信心的是他底同學巴札洛夫；這次他回家的時候，是同伴着巴札洛夫一起來的。因此，對於他老父尼可拉的一切行動，都是以他那虛無主義的眼光來批判。而使他老父有時感到很不痛快。</p>
<p>尼可拉有一個哥哥帕威爾，是一個十足貴族尊嚴的保持者，一個頭固的老人，因之巴扎洛夫與他常常發生爭論。</p>
<p>好些日子以後，二個志同道合的虛無主義者，在一個歡迎會上，認識　一個美麗的太太安娜；從而，不知不覺地墮入了戀愛之城裏面，他們在安娜面前一切舉止行動，似都有些與往日異樣了。</p>
<p>兩個虛無主義者，一同走入了安娜的莊園之後，巴扎洛夫獲得了勝利。而阿爾卡狄却與安娜的妹妹開的亞也十分熱情。</p>
<p>不久，他們二人覺得單鑽在戀愛的牛角尖裘，未免太不値得。於是他們脫離了戀愛的糾紛，　時同到巴扎洛夫的家裏去住。　巴扎洛夫的父親是一個　明的小農奴。他們到了那裏之後，戀愛的絆索並沒有脫離了他們；阿爾卡狄又借故跑到安娜的莊園·巴扎浴夫則想起了尼可拉　愛的一塡房」費尼，而到了尼可拉家裏，並且得到了機會與費尼接了兩次吻。</p>
<p>這一秘密却給尼可拉頑固的哥哥帕威爾知道了，怒不可遏，約好了與巴扎浴夫決鬥。決鬥的最後，那頑固的老人受了傷，由於這敎訓，老人倒改去了以前的頑固而與新潮流妥協。</p>
<p>巴扎浴夫不能再居住在尼可拉的家裏了；他離開之後，曾跑到安娜那裏把這事情吿訴阿爾卡狄，並且還與安娜見了一面，終而回到他自己老父的田莊。</p>
<p>這裏，尼可拉由於他那改變後的哥哥的相勸，打破了階級觀念與費尼正式舉行了婚禮。阿爾卡狄也與安娜的妹妹　愛成功，與他父親同一日子結婚。</p>
<p>父與子在同一吉”良辰上，結合了兩對新人；之後，父子共同經營農業，做得很順利；家庭之間，也很融洽，在那美滿幸福的環境下，他們過着那甜密的生活。</p>
<p>巴扎洛夫呢？他回到了家裏之後，幹着與農民施醫的工作，可是，他某次解剖一不留心，染上了可怕的疾病，便結束了他底一生。</p>
<p>巴扎洛夫的父母，在他們兒子底靈前常常　吿，哭泣着／</p>
<p>這部巨著，在這裏作了它最後一頁。</p>
<p>讀了這部作品，很明白地　出它是以戀愛的波潤起伏爲綫索，充分地表露出浪漫主義的氣氛，及其非現實性。在戀愛的糾葛中，各種思想是沉默了。</p>
<p>巴扎洛夫，原是一個前進的思想者，在這裏是到處碰壁，苦惱。結果他毀滅了自己。</p>
<p>阿爾卡狄，雖是巴扎洛夫的崇拜者，但沒有巴底桀驚不訓；受了他父親與伯父的愛護，結果也做了事業的隨從者。</p>
<p>尼可拉呢？他的牛前進的思想，與他的兒子合作，走入了粉紅色幸福的家庭裏；他底哥哥也改革了一部頑固的貴族的自尊心，而取得了妥協。</p>
<p>這部作品在文學的描寫方面，是不可否認地有它底技巧的精美。結稱方面也稱完美。唯在意識方面，前面已說過，並不能配合事實，而全有俗物主義的方式。</p>
<p>它把一個前進的靑年，用譏諷的筆寫成自己毀滅的道路，而在貴族方面，作者反其有同情心。帕威爾的妥協，尼可拉父子的甜密生活，正與巴扎洛夫相反。</p>
<p>這作品描寫的文笨很値得學習，因爲這作品在常作藝術品來　，是一件很好的精品。譯者巴金是根據英文本譯出的，譯筆方面尙稱通暢，唯興原文方面未必完全一致。總之，道是一件描繪得很美麗的藝術品！</p>
<h3>關於蘇聨人</h3>
<p>— 九章</p>
<p>A．WHITE：A　REPORT　ON　THE　RUSSIANS</p>
<p>這本書的作者，威特先生，一九四四年夏天在美蘇關係極融洽的時候到蘇聯去觀光，得到「特准」，可以「看自己所要看的，回國以後寫自己所願意寫的」。他到過蘇聯腹地馬拉爾工業區，這是一九二六五年計劃開始以後任何外國人沒有到過的地方。他進入烏克蘭剛剛收復的農村，和農夫談話，想聽到他們眞實的心坎費的話。其間當然也有一兩决，思想統治之鐵腕阻止了威特先生訪問的自由。他們到一個西伯利亞的工廠裏參觀，他和一位操德語的女工談得很投契。可是威特剛一轉身，一位秘密警察（NKVD，　名GPU）就對那和她談天，她就唯唯諾諾或默默不語了。「在蘇聯，那兒有人可以自由和外國人交談呢」？但是，大體上，威特一羣人的訪問已經很自由。尤其是他在莫斯科和一位女翻譯官辯論，他坦白地說明他以爲蘇聯不如美國的地方；那坦白的程度恐怕會使讀者驚異罷。</p>
<p>我個人特別發生興趣的是一般蘇聯人的生活到底怎樣？本書作者的觀點碰巧正是如此：他不去空泛地論蘇聯的政策，却常常要知道一個工人的目用帳。一般人的生活水準是施政的成績，而不能算軍事秘密。把這種材料當做軍事秘密，因而引起人家的懷疑，總是一種不智之舉。</p>
<p>第三章裏，作者叔述他參觀了三個莫斯科的工廠，一個飛機製造廠，一個汽車工廠，和一個餅乾廠。在第一廠他打聽一下工作時間和工資。普通工人的工作時間是每週六十六小時，所得是一千盧幣。在工廠食堂裏喫一天飯化五個慮幣，很便宜。可是剩下的每月八百或者更多的盧幣能買什麼呢？在「商店」裏火腿一千多盧幣一磅，鷄肉五百左右一磅。　衣服那就更貴了。所以這位工人先生到本工廠食堂去喫飯可以果腹，到指定的戲院去看戲可以消磨幾天晚上，但「離開了工廠他的衣食立刻成問題」，他不能如美國人似的有積蓄，威特先生說「工廠在理論上是屬于工人的其實工人是屬於工廠的」。</p>
<p>在第二個工廠，咸特先生問「經理」假使工人工作意惰怎麼辦？「其先是壁報上警吿，以後到工會去講話。威特先生立刻了然！工會已變成約束工人的組織了。另一次（第八章）威特問一個工會領袖，如果工人不滿于目前的工作，能不能到別的地方去？答案是「他必須向廠方申請」。「如果不　請而團開，他能不能在別處找到工作」？答案是「不，在全蘇聯他將很難找到工作」。威特先生還　　問：。「這不是相當于黑名單嗎」？答案是「不能算黑名單」。美國人頭惱裏的「自由」在蘇聯的字典上查不出。至於第四章中作者把蘇聯工人和美國監犯的生活比擬起來，也許嫌憤激一點龍。、，以此類推，「全　蘇聯的工人的待遇相差不多，因爲工廠全屬政府的，待遇全是政府規定的」。中國讀者也許有人贊成這種辦法，美國一般人却看不慣。</p>
<p>「在蘇聯，在業工人的生活，還不及美國經濟恐慌時期領取失業津貼的工人的生活」。這句話可靠到什麼程度，很難說。但是像書中那蘇聯女翻譯官的話也只好算「聊以解嘲」她說？「我自己很苦，但我知道別人皆苦，我一就安慰了」。有常識的人皆知道一社會主義打的旗號是要實現「人一問天堂」，不是大家一樣窮。打一的旗號和做的眞事總會有距離。一種理想，到實行的時候，總會有些變了樣子。法國革命前後是如此，俄國革命也未嘗不如此。</p>
<p>筆渚對於美蘇兩種經濟）制度沒有研究，只好就威特先生所認爲的蘇聯缺點，簡略說一下。（一）蘇政府從一個中心（克林姆宮）去計劃，去指導全國工廠的活動與發展，是一件很難的事。各個工廠的「經理」或負責人容易因循起來，少自動性（InitiatiVe），而且有些技術人才管理人才因政治路綫時有被清算之　。（二）取消了牟利的心理，競爭心减少，一般人不想改進生產方法。照威特先生看，美國的制度對於新發明的刺激力總比蘇聯制度大。史達哈諾夫運動其實是暗中恢復競爭，可是「勛章」的鼓勵並不及實利。「一般地說，資本主義社會裏有發明，社會主義模仿着。」這是威特的看法。</p>
<p>不過，書中讀到的，也就是作者看到的，蘇聯優點也很多。譬如：蘇聯人生活水池較美國低，可是沒有乞丐。在戰時，牧資總是　第一綫軍人用。以及蘇聯政府　於處理少數民族間題等。這此事作者絕未抺煞。</p>
<p>「印象記」或「回憶錄」之類的書，在英　書籍中成一重要部門。文字流利，有如小說；觀察獨到，足供專家采摘。這本書亦如此。但我們的戰後出版界一時還很少見這一類的書。</p>

<h3>介紹〔孟姜女〕</h3>
<p>— 王泊生</p>
<p>遠在二十一年以前正在北平從事固有及現代戲劇　術的研究改進工作，恰巧在眞光影院看到了阿富夏羅穆夫先生的歌劇處女作觀首的演出。十二年以前，在山東省立劇院，曾經從事歌劇岳飛的試演，和平不久以前，在國立歌劇學校與鄭志聲林剛白陳田鶴朱崇志以及音樂舞踊界的許多友八，又從事歌劇荊軻軒鄭成功　國之歌的實驗演出，今天阿富　羅穆天及陳鍾兄等的孟美女也已上演於京滬等地，而這一次參加演出者，一部分是過去的同仁與同學，都向我說這次則作法，同我們以前的實騐，在理論及技法的運用上都是一樣，因此，我述看了兩次，對於其構成的原則，以及其影響於政治哲學，及藝術哲學上的種種問題，作一鄭重的介紹與說明。</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>爲什麼要介紹這一類型的藝術呢，就政治哲學的觀點說；中國自三代以降，因爲受封建思想的影響，民族思想領域已逐漸有了無形的樊　，社會因之日趨理智，在廣大的社會中，與夫人民的心理上，已經造成了一定的態式，與信仰，因之文化的本身，兩千年來入於停滯的階段，此一無形中含有病態之社會，在近百年來，更感受國際上在經濟種種方面的壓迫，後由理智而趨於貧困，因之自然的形成了，自私自利勾心鬥角，使社會陷人崩潰粉碎一盤散沙之境地，而這也就是光總理從事革命工作的原因之一了。鼎革之後，繼之以堅苦之抗戰，亦竟已竟其全功，在戰前戰後就政治以及種種方面之改進來說，凡屬明大體的工作人員，多已在領袖的逐日督責之下盡其最大之力量，而仍不能挽救，社會之頹風於萬一者，其問題自亦別有听歸矣。</p>
<p>以管見所及，今後復興之道，一爲科學，一爲藝術，科學的重要人所共知，而藝術之重要，允重於科學，則不易爲一般人士所理解，舉例，試就自然科學的工業產品來說，凡屬找到宇宙間自然規律愈是眞實，那麼力量就愈大，對於人類的貢獻也愈多，然而任憑是原子彈也好，飛機也好，他的性能力量終於是有限的，究竟操縱宇宙，撼動宇宙的，還是人類，原因在於人類有一個微妙的靈魂，因此古人治國，對於人類的靈魂生活，以及靈魂的住宅所謂人體，的耳目口鼻，在衣食住行種抓方面，均有所養，（禮）作爲其政治　施之依據，所以其政治哲學是，禮節民心，樂和民聲，政以行之，刑以防之，禮樂刑政，四達而不悖，則王道備突，從而知道，刑政是不得已的設施，禮樂乃是其生活之要件，（禮者養也，應作時間及空問藝術之節，來看，就人事來說，是人與人間的分寸而已，請參閱史記司馬遷論禮樂作篇）</p>
<p>自然科學已經到了這樣複雜的階段，那麼培植人民心靈的藝術，也必須與自然科學的功能作平行的進展，才能產生均衡的效用，比如古人的轎子，多麼好　，再也沒人去坐，因爲同飛機火車的功用，相去太遠了，所以古代禮樂的功能，一部分應由樂劇來代替，因爲樂必入於劇，才能刺人之心，應人之節，我們實在不能因爲有一個劇字，便以爲那不過是對於人生的一種裝飾而已，因爲歌劇是一種有力量的機體，綫條色彩的運用，是人類精神上視覺科學的創造，節奏旋律是人類憲魂上聽覺科學之創造，一切進步的藝術，都是培植靈魂的科學。惟有對於靈魂有良好的培植，人與人間才能發生熱力，人的襟懷才能大起來：才能有彈力，有同情心，社會才能活躍起來，而有新的生機，因此歐美任何一個科學發　的國家，也必是　術發達的國家，因爲社會平治，科學才有　礎，精神不入正軌，社會無法望其平治，是有相互作用的。這便是應當重視這種藝術事業的原因之一了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>就時代藝術哲學的觀點來說。中國的社會，旣已陷入於理智貧困的階段，在藝術上如果再從事挑撥，或予以分歧的暗示，直接受害的乃是民衆，針對着過去封建社會所給予我們社會太形現智的史實，似乎不能不在情感藝術的創造上有所祈求因爲社會不是一味破壤所能弄的好，也不是一味鞭馳所能奏效的。</p>
<p>以下要我就創造的觀點，來說幾句話，因爲這對於孟姜女一劇的分析，是必需的，凡是一種偉大的藝術，他自身便是一種美的境界，有着不可侵犯的風格，有此格，而後能格人，一種美的境界，必有他構成的因素，就音樂來說，因爲有節奏所以能超越現實，因爲超越現實所以們人才能忘其醜惡，而一種美的境界與夫偉大的風格，就歌劇來說，其成功，往往不屬於一種，表現介體的成功，因爲他必須是各種表現介體的均衡發展，才能產生一種靈肉協和的有機組織。但是有的時候，也有例外，如果某種表現介體有牠獨具的美，亦可逐漸誘致其他表現介體與之協和，而逐漸形成一個完整之組織，例如人類的靈魂是先天的賦與，他衣　行動的配合，是受着靈魂的支配的，雖然一種粉飾，也有時候敎人眞偽難辦，所以一個歌劇藝術家，如何把握着那開務成務的法門，的確不是一件容易事，孟姜女樂舞　的　能可責處，乃在於對於這種協和的運用，立有了相當的基礎。</p>
<p>中國音樂的獨立風格究竟是什麼呢？這是首先要研究的問題，中國是一個倫理道德的社會，所以在音樂方面不是以音樂創造情感，而是以　藥創造其倫理之格，　於倫理道德的構成，所以其社會之一切藝術，遂亦有所憑藉而具有其獨立之體態，於是有首，有腹，有尾，多是超脫現實，和平，人格的表現，他的價値與其說着重在情感上，不如說是着重在人格上，即如鐘所以立武，竹所以立會，鼓所以立動，磐所以立辨是也，吾人之所以珍視吾人之打擊樂器者，其原因只在於此，就時代說，中國　樂的貧弱，己經被其時代之洪流所吞沒無遺，阿當夏羅穆夫先生，拾起了久經被人遺忘的東西，給與他豐富的情感，時代的力量，使得一種中國獨具的語言，（音樂是世界的語言）變爲世界的語言，的確是一件値得珍視的事。孟姜女樂的章如果再行加强其主調的創造，俾使其性格更形有力，或更格外鮮明了。</p>
<p>關於動作方面，我以爲藝術家的眼睛裏，對於他的一切表現介體，絕無新舊優劣之分，因爲一切新的東西，多半是從舊的變化而來，藝術家所要愼重考慮的是力量的均衡，色調的協和，尺度的遠近，節奏的快慢，就動作來說，節奏，線條是牠力的表現介體，這種節奏，能與音樂，裝置，劇文，及其他有關各方面取得一致的協和，必然是成功的。中國固有戲劇同印度的戲劇相同之點甚多，主要的是動作，前年在重農曾與甘歌利先生交換意見，他對於中　戲劇之以動作代表文字之處，深爲贊美，我以爲在戲劇上，有就己已有之長，再行作進一步發展之必要，因爲在藝搜，牠還是一種新的啓示呢。從前在岳飛的演出上，曾作動作上協和與不協和的表現，與音樂的和聲作均衡的發展，其功能有的時候超過音樂，因爲動作畢竟較音樂鮮明的多。孟姜女實際執行導演任務的是陳鍾兄，曾經費過不少的苦心，都看得出來，仍然希望他們更行努力，俾使賓主分明，有了高潮，能够使圖案的變化，再行增多，動，靜，的運用再行得體，以加強其性格之創造，那麼對於固有藝術之新的協和介紹，當可在現代劇壇上立下獨立創造之規模矣。</p>
<p>在裝置上，其風格大體亦頗協和，惟仍應加强每一幅圖畫之重心，使一切的升華作用都超越現實，都有所本。</p>
<p>在服飾上，亦頗華麗，看不出大的毛病，如能不固守史實，根據史實在線條色彩上加重性格之表現或更形鮮豔些。</p>
<p>劇文方面，全劇對話似應改爲詩體，其句讀不必就固有的在陰陽平上去入上去因襲，（舊劇如是）而應當在輕說，與重說方面，就情感去創造，至於在全劇的結構上，每一幕的高潮，以及全劇高潮，都應加强力量，使其成爲立體的格體，以容納所有的技法。</p>
<p>我想道一切問題在她已樹立了一個難能可貴的規模的現在，是很容易改動的，因爲這都是些枝節的問題了‘</p>
<p>從政治上的而要，以及藝術哲學上的觀點而論，不能不說孟姜女的演出，是一個最堪珍視的工作，因爲在同一的原則之下，我們古代偉大的史詩，與夫一切文化與藝術上之退跡，均可借此以與國內外人士有進一步表達的機會了，雖則這一種創造，在我們自己也不是不能把握，而音樂藝術的修查，畢竟是一種天才的任務，並需長時間去努力的，阿富夏羅穆夫，在中國已有三十年之歷史，他爲藝術事業來工作，是値得歡迎的，韓德爾Handel是德國人，寄居英國，而得名，其米賽亞神劇，因受英王之祟敬，傳爲世界之美談，蕭邦Chopin是波蘭人，也是寄居法國而成名，因爲藝術是人類共有的財產。一至於在戲劇的情節方面，看得出來秦始皇是個自私自利不顧一民衆饑苦，只圖達到萬世基業屬一於一家之慾望，而作此殘暴無道違背大衆的舉動，將人民的一切加以破壞，以爲一人一姓作犧性，而修建萬里長城，那麼萬喜良一孟姜女不過是全民中之一代表而已，受其害者固家家如此，如果正視現實，那麼在此次大戰之後一，全世界人民正在苦痛不堪的時候，各國均苦於再以全力去擴充軍備，則此劇對於挽救和平挽救世人不能不說是一個最有意義的貢獻了，因爲她最可珍視的地方，是以藝術之格來格人的。</p>

<p>尤其在秋日，我對這環境發生依變。我時常携帶一根便於作防身武器的搽漆手杖，漫步到城根附近來遊覽。我很奇異自己不知爲了什麼動機，對這等灰色的景　房然起着遊覽的興趣。</p>
<p>中秋後一天，我循照舊路，走到城牆下面，打算再向北前進一程，找那可以上城去觀光的石級。我遇見一個穿藍布大掛的矮胖子，饅首似的頭剃得很光凈，右手托　用荷葉承住的幾片豆腐，左手提了一隻香油瓶，對我笑笑地說：</p>
<p>「六爺，你真是怪趣兒，幹嗎逛到這來啦？」</p>
<p>我可住他瞧了半嚮。</p>
<p>「你忘記我了吧，」他做出一個昻藏的樣子，給痰嗆了一下，說。「你沒聽過話區子裘面拉的什麼，多少！我就住在你大爺家斜對面。」</p>
<p>哦，是了，他姓祁，一個琴師。每天傍晚，從對面院裏發出來那幽逸的胡琴聲，就是從他手邊傳到我耳裏來的。由於對藝術所生的感應，我不禁將自己那頑　的狀態改變了，帶着些懷慕的表情，說：</p>
<p>「是您呵！我那會不知道。您的手藝，豈只現在，我從小就領略的不少。現在可怎樣？」</p>
<p>「唉，不用提了吧。現在，現在，現在是一個沒事。「</p>
<p>「沒事？您不上戲院裏拉琴了嗎？」</p>
<p>「兩年沒幹這差事啦。」</p>
<p>老祁的眼有些發陰，像一朶愁雲　地遮住他的心境。的確，我也聰人說，這一年，他只受過一處冷靜地方——賓宴華樓幾位票友的邀請，他從前的光燄不知消失到那裏去了。他成了馬路上那些「三人　」（Trio）的凡亞鈴奏手，有時，找一個伴搭也費勁了呢。是老　了？或爲了別的原因，離失了老　們的靑睞了？</p>
<p>「合不上帮了，六爺。他們新，——自家兒說新，把咱們看作舊。習的老閩也愛新，編新調，走哈爾濱，跑香港，上海。剩下我這　不變不動的，一是捨不得北平的煤麵便宜，一又是家有老母。我就這麼潦倒下來，可不活該馬？</p>
<p>「您太自謙，開班子招生就是。」</p>
<p>「那裏的話！說容易，說也不容易……」</p>
<p>老祁似乎驀地生出不愉快的念頭，托着豆腐，經我身旁走了過去，不幾步，收尾說：</p>
<p>「明兒格見！」</p>
<p>這一次離開北平是一九三三年，爲的去找幾個朋友辦一椿小事，誰知四年之後，我仍舊回到僻靜的故居來了。我仍舊住在前院——窗旁有兩株棗樹的那間房。我開始了作一種編輯工作——根據凡本原文，給近代的主要批評潮流，摘取它的大意，寫成一本册子。</p>
<p>我希望在那國淡的角落間，恢復早年的靈感，寫詩的散文。但我己聽不見那一股雅逸的胡琴聲。這在過去無日不令我發生懷舊，空想，失眠的琴聲，從茲竟沉寂，不由他猜度着——呵，老祁，你沉寂了……你不是丟棄藝術，或者他遷了？</p>
<p>僕人老田吿知我說，當一次問他之際：</p>
<p>「老祁坐牢啦，現在還沒出來。前年他開小　賣店，虧耗幾百；回老家賣地皮，又打上了官事。官事打輸，就給……嗐，可惜，那一手好西皮！」</p>

<h3>伏爾泰</h3>
<p>— 幹四</p>
<p>一七一一七年法國大文豪伏爾泰到英國的時候，發現英國人正在非常痛恨法國人，所以在倫敦街道上行走，乃是一件對於他生命都會發生危險的事。某日他正在散步，有一羣憤怒的英國人火聲呼喊道：「殺死他，吊死這個法國人！」</p>
<p>伏爾泰立定了脚，面對着　　，大聲說道：「諸位英國人！你們要殺死我，因爲我是一個法國人！可是我不幸而不能做一個英國人，這處罰不是已經够嚴重了嗎？」</p>
<p>羣衆聽了不禁發在地歡呼起來，便將幹伏爾泰安全送到他自四己的寓所裏去。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血120</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見爲什麼要到松島來？顯而易見，知道他的計劃，已經失敗了。他以爲可以利用黑龍會，一面可以消極地减輕掣肘的勢力，一面或許可以積極地獲到較多較確的消息，可以用來探取「七封秘緘」的秘密。誰知黑龍會反而給了他一個萍子，一個相當厲害的對手；而且，從這十幾小時的經過看來，如還是一個情魔，一種不易　脫的纏障。</p>
<p>從近衛府邸那裏，他看出了近衛這個貪功噬殺的魔星，沒有理想的那般容易對付。此外，他原也知道第五縱隊，相當厲害，然而却未夢想到其中竟有這等機警敏捷的人物。還有那個靑木長老，簡直是個不可思議的魔術家，竟能把握着形而上的樓力，左右我人的心理。現在還沒知道他們對於這次侵略戰的觀念如何，萬一竟是贊成吞併整個亞洲，想做世界盟主，同那些魔星一般思想，那樣，他們這種魔術團體，也是一個極大的阻力，換句話說，鶴見想要用自己和幾個同志的力量，來勾當這件揭露「秘械」的大事，却是等於緣木求魚了。</p>
<p>此外，聽聽萍子的口氣，東京的黨政軍商，派別很多，各有相當的勢力，並且把自己這小小的一個人物，來參加黑龍會的舉動，當了一篇文章，竟那麼小題大做起來；這，對於自己的計劃，　未動手，竟看得見，決定難以成功了。而且他這兩天體力上的消耗，也是叫他墮入灰心絕望的一個大因素。所以他暫時放下了一切，一溜烟跑到松島來。小源夫人和菊子，有着母親，愛人，和知己的混合溫情和瞭解，並且這地點和住宅的幽靜淸雅，足够消除心上的惡劣情境。</p>
<p>他　　了一會，呆想了一會，覺得俄了，便穿了拖鞋下樓。又是菊子首先發現鶴見下樓，她好像早早在樓梯下邊伺候着似的。她先向鶴見行了一個家常便禮，問他睡得可安穩，然後，用她不大不小，很甜脆的嗓子，向半開着的　房門內喊着，「媽，玉哥下樓來了。」小源夫人也在廚房裏答應　：「菊兒，快把佛堂的門打開。」接　就見那位六十過頭，而並不能鍾的老太太，從廚房裏趕了出來，一臉的慈祥笑容。</p>
<p>菊子當先，把佛堂門開了，側着身子讓過鶴見和母親進了佛堂。這是一間四舖栩榻米的小房間，裏面已經燃上了油燈和芝蘭香。正中小神籠上有一座佛像，下面供桌上有幾架鏡框，每一架裏有一張放大像片，其中一張是小源計多之的生前攝影，就是菊子的父親；一張是梅子的照片，鶴見的養生母親。</p>
<p>小源夫人和菊子陪着鶴見，在這佛堂裏行禮，祈福，然後才同着一路，走到起居室裏，從新大家見面，行禮，問候；却一點沒有嘮勞叨叨的瑣碎，菊子這時，拿出她的看家本領，先伺候鶴見坐下，然後照應下女上菜燙酒。這裏充滿了溫情：小源夫人跌坐在近窗口的地方，笑瞇瞇地瞧着鸛見吃酒，一邊說雨句客氣得不讓人難堪的話：「我好像有些預覺，今天無意上市裏去，也無意買了這點食品，你平日喜歡的小　魚，就不曉得你口味改了沒有……？」</p>
<p>菊子一杯一杯的　酒，偶然插進一兩句淸雅的笑話，「玉哥的口味，不大會變的；瞧他先一筷子就是魚片，第二筷子又是魚片，第三筷還是魚片哩。」</p>
<h3>贈梅蘭芳博士</h3>
<p>— 趙誠伯</p>
<p>七絕四首有序</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士，長書樂，善歌舞，爲當代菊部之雄。大戰時，陷敵中，求脫不得，蓄　拒演；去毀容吞炭，誓身報國者，不甚相遠。蓋唐樂人雷海靑之流亞歟？勝利後，開在申剃　演費宮人刺虎，一票價萬金，擦背摩肩，有若趨市。人劇雙完，其引人也宜矣！鏡張生農，每　烈女之貞；簫管空箱，更見關鄉之志。作七絕四首以美。</p>
<p>正是征人破　天，霓裳歌舞憶燈前；梨園自有傷心事，梅蛆　　已十年。</p>
<p>鬼火秋墳土萬坵，興亡如夢水長流；戰學莫謂無人老，博士如今也白頭。</p>
<p>紅粉靑衫報國情，鳩形鵠面恥偷生；善才死去龜年老，更有何人識姓名？</p>
<p>十年冷落　坊歌，今日廂樓笑語和；我乞　郞莫便老，中原仍是漢山河。</p>

<h3>哀棚戶</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>政出必行，我們竭誠擁護，當局有實幹精神，有賢明計劃，想做事，肯做事，我們也十分敬佩；而所有施政時所遭遇到的困難和阻撓，天地良心，我們更能理解而願寄以同情和支持的。不過，對於拆遷棚戶一事，我們想建議度過這個嚴冬，明春再來舉辦，就是說，延期兩個月後實行，不知這個　見，能邀淸聽否？</p>
<p>爲四百萬人的安全，犧牲四萬棚戶，即便不到這樣精確的程度，但市區建築，自有整個計劃，又何况這四萬棚戶絕非犧性，祇是請他們喬遷到非禁建區而已。所以原則上，我們絕對擁護，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>爲什麼要代請求展緩兩月實行呢？那實在茲於人道。今年一年，百業已感蕭條，中下階層，特別感到經濟上的壓迫，再加大寒地沍，殘冬臘尾，一拆一建，大興土木，不僅財力上平增負担，即人力上也感狼狽。假使你我是這四萬戶中之一，急景凋年，你我的情緒上將會蒙上一層怎樣悲楚的陰影呀！</p>
<p>人間味！我們最好能稍稍顧及一些！</p>
<p>自然，我們深知這次當局的愼重處事，又深知棚戶們必能服從功令，遵照辦理，決不致發生問題，也許我們太情感了一點，假使讓這批棚戶茍安渡過這個嚴冬，豈不更貼切人情嗎？</p>
<p>是婦人之仁罷！</p>
<h3>十年前今日在東京</h3>
<p>— 小麥</p>
<p>…記歷史上重要的一天…</p>
<p>十年前今日，蔣主席蒙難西安，事情經過十三天，才脫險返京，離陝前，蔣主席曾對張楊二氏訓話，句中有說：「此决西安事變，實爲中國五十年歷史絕續所關，亦爲中華民國存亡極火關鍵。」十年來的歷史，證實了這兩句「先知的」評語，並無誇大。</p>
<p>「雙十二」事變發生當時，筆者羈留東京，當時各方情景，歷今依稀記憶。</p>
<p>據文獻上記載，「雙十二事變」的發生時刻是在當天未明晨前五時。當晨西安電報局已被防軍監視，所以消息不能傳出。東京的第一次號外，記得是在常日晚報之前發刊過一次，那似乎是由南京發報過來的。據事後筆者所知，當時及以後各報社的電文，多有被日當局扣刪，所以剩下來的已短得無可再短。在下午五時左右晚報以後，還有某一家報社的號外。</p>
<p>仇者快</p>
<p>自此以後，一直到「十二·廿五」蔣氏脫險返京爲止，東京各大報社的駐華記者曾受總社的命令，作報導的競賽。甚至市內的外勤記者也拼命採訪外方面的反嚮。當時麻布區的中國駐日大使館及許世英大使，自然是第一個日標，但許氏守口如瓶，記者的一無所獲。據事後所知道的，日本東京的「霞個關」（外務省）與「三宅坂」（陸軍省），陸續所接獲的情報，堪與使館比美！</p>
<p>市內外勤記者寫無可寫，祀無可記時，當年東京異軍突起與「朝日」「每日」兩大霸主作「爭霸戰」的「讀賣新開」，居然採訪到留日學生的宿舍來了，某留東學生回答說：「我們所曉得的事情，和報紙上所記載的一樣多」這句話（有點像「外交辭令」，然而確是事實）想不到也刊在市聞版頭條，並且插了好幾張照片。</p>
<p>從十二日那晚上起，我淸楚地記得，東京的茶館，小飯館，和澡堂裏都以此爲話題，作爲聯天的中心。</p>
<p>日本軍政首要，對當時的情景，自然十分「關切」。筆者於十三日深夜偶然囚事坐「計時汽車」，路經日本外務省附近！看見他們尙燈火輝煌，有異於平。卞四日早上看報，才曉得常晚日本各方首要，在那裏有過四五小時的長會議，討論所謂「對策」，其貿一貫以道之二「看能否混水摸魚，趁勢撈一把」。</p>
<p>翌日日本海陸兩軍首腦且舉行聯席會議，決定如下兩個所謂「原則」：（一）必要時採取自衛之　備指置；（二）警戒面靜觀。這不是「摸魚」措置是作麼？當時的外相是有田，陸相是寺內，海相是永野。</p>
<p>事發後，許大使與日本當局之第一次正式接觸是十八日蔣鼎文氏自陝返洛以後的翌日，這一談，談了五十多分鐘。當時外相有田並且厚着臉皮的請求：「希望以私人資格，獲得關於西安事變的若干特殊消息」。</p>
<p>當年日本駐華大使是川越，但十二月五日則早因中日談判已吿一段落而離京住滬。至十九日，奉「外務省」訓令才由滬返京。不過無論川越在京在滬，東京方面在這十三天日所獲得的情報，問樣的迅速而詳細。</p>
<p>有趣的是土肥原這時務頭子所發表的觀感，他一淸二楚的說出露骨話：「日本對中國，實在應該急速從新檢討一番了」。</p>
<p>失望了</p>
<p>儘管外交辭令如何漂亮，報章社評如何滑頭，日本的軍閥當時之想大大小小也得趁勢撈一把却是不可否定的事貿。筆者還記得「雙十二」以後，東京的股票市塲，花紗布交易，和人造絲絲價之急瀉直下，就可證明日人心中想像中的是什麼。這豐不是在「如意算盤」上想兩方擴大衝突而釀成大戰嗎？</p>
<p>十二月廿五日晚，東京各報亦發號外，並且多附有蔣氏照片。當晚本係誕在歡之夜，但就在這一晚，許多財閥軍閥都大失所望了。因爲：他們所希望的已告幻滅。僅僅股票市傷上有些人撈了一把。</p>
<p>當夜許多留學生的確確狂歡了一晚，有些幾乎鬧個通宵。但他們說竟爲了慶祝什麼則成疑問。在那一夜裏，有幾個人曉得七個月以後即將開始的中日大戰，已埋下火藥綫和九年後勝利的種子呢？</p>
<h3>向孩子學習吧！</h3>
<h3>12與13</h3>
<p>— 默默</p>
<p>有人相信「十三」是個最不吉利的數目，原因是耶穌最後之晚餐，連殺耶穌的猶大在內，恰恰十三個人一席。</p>
<p>於是乎就有人說：「西安事變」當年之能和平解決，原因在乎事發日是「十二」而非「十三」。</p>
<p>但是他忘記了，從事發到解圍而至蔣公脫險飛出，所經過的日數，即自十二日到廿五日，恰恰是十三天！</p>
<p>又有人這麼說：在十一日晚上，邵元冲，楊虎城，陳誠……諸氏在西安吃的那一桌飯，是十三個人一席。於是乎十二日凌農，邵氏遭難。</p>
<p>而當晚的宴會，張學良「少帥」並沒有出席，後來不是獲請特赦了嗎？</p>
<p>邵元冲當晚住的是西安之「西京招待所」一百十三號房間。殉難地又是「十三」！</p>
<p>惟有端納氏於十三飛陝斡旋，這「十三」却是個好兆頭。</p>
<p>而今天，那「招待所」已把這染有歷史血痕的房間，改爲一百三十號了。</p>
<p>但阿拉伯字號碼寫來，仍是「十三」，不過「十三」後顯帶一個「零」，表示戾氣已消罷了！</p>
<p>〔12〕，多事之日</p>
<p>以月份而談，一年中的五月是紀念日最多的月份。但以日序而言，每月「十二日」，似是一個「多事之日」。</p>
<p>今天的十二日就是一例。十年前今天十二日，就有人鬧得天覆地翻，險些兒出大亂子。</p>
<p>其他各月份以十二日爲節日者，據筆者所知，尙有：</p>
<p>二月十二日，南北統一紀念三月十二日，孫中山先生逝世紀念。</p>
<p>四月十二日，民十三年淸黨紀念日。</p>
<p>十一月十二日孫中山先生誕生紀念。</p>
<p>十二月十二日，西安事變紀念。</p>
<p>又，蔣主席十年前由西安脫險過浴返京，爲十二月廿五日，此日旣爲雲南起義紀念日，亦爲舉世歡騰之「聖誕節」。（墨）</p>
<h3>女人第一？</h3>
<p>— 陳中</p>
<p>我國一向是重男輕女，一般父母都把女兒認爲「人家」人，要是一且嫁了出去，那更是出門不認貨所謂「嫁出了的女兒，潑出了的水」。雖然我們在舊書籍上也能例外地看到重女的記載，但畢竟是例外。可喜的是近年來男女平權之說高唱以來，社會上對於女人已經側目而視，另眼相看了，尤其在都市中，最風光的還是女人，勢利的父母，重女更甚，女兒就是他們的搖錢樹，兒子才是沒有出息！</p>
<p>在上海華洋雜處的「上等」社會中，我們常常聽到「女人第一」—Ladies　First—這麼一個口號，居然中英對照，該是國際名言吧？所以信奉的人很多：抽烟要經女人許可，看見女人得脫帽，上車下軍，入室出室，都請女人佔光，連幾個大學堂裏也是女學生第一，在講堂內坐在第一排，成了不可變易的習慎法。</p>
<p>國民大會代表，並沒有以年齡爲準而另定少代表老代表，但却別成一體的有婦女代表。難道婦女配不上做社會賢達和政黨代表……嗎？難道婦女代表單是因爲本身是婦女而才作代表的嗎？想來也是受了「女人第一」的影響。「女人第一」究竟是侮辱女人還是尊敬女人？</p>
<p>「女人第一」這個風氣十足道地的來自歐美，咱們中國人不過是照樣「拷貝」却不知道「女人第一」在歐美就是一個矛盾。</p>
<p>以英文來舉例吧：除了演講的時候Ladies　and　Gentlemen一語，其中女人在先外。假如寫信給王先生和王太太，他們在信上總寫Ｍr．and　Mrs．Wang而不寫Mrs．and　Mr．Wang女人在後，此其一也。在文章上，尤其是美國人常喜歡用He　or　She或His　or　her總是男性在上，女性在下此其二也。至於「人類」一字在英文爲Mankind而不是Ｗomankind，可見男人足以代表人類，而女子則不足。稱「人」曰Human　Being而不稱Huwoman　Being也是同樣情形。語言本是代表民族國家的主要特徵，在英美（女人第一的發祥地）尙且有這許多矛盾可見；邊論其他？</p>
<h3>大可樂觀</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>甲：「聽說下一次世界大戰如果爆發，戰爭將要決勝於比原子彈更兇的細菌武器了！」</p>
<p>乙：「噢！幸運極了！在下一次世界大戰以後，中國一定是名符其實的强國了！」</p>
<p>甲：「何以見得？」</p>
<p>乙：「不是嗎？中國多的正是細菌哩！」</p>
<h3>寓言</h3>
<p>— 國鴻</p>
<p>某日，一個年輕力肚的靑年忽然生了奇症。他左手打右手，右手打左手，打得皮爛肉開，但是他仍然愈打愈有勁。旁人搖搖頭，不解。</p>
<h3>牛乳和餅乾　福薄難消受</h3>
<p>— 蕭</p>
<p>國大代表移點心費振濟南京難民，振濟物品中有着「牛乳」和「餅乾」。</p>
<p>但是很奇怪，難民倒不希罕「牛乳和餅乾」，却要求發給『大餅油條」—難道牛乳和餅乾不及大餅油條的「營養」嗎？倒也使人有些疑惑！</p>
<p>論理，飢不擇食，那有不要餅乾要大餅之理？猜想起來，恐怕是飽不飽的問題。牛乳餅乾雖然芳名可愛，但每人所得之量，未必比兩塊大餅，兩個油條更實惠呢！</p>
<h3>哭毛毯</h3>
<p>— 夢仙</p>
<p>「毛毯不知何處去？老天依舊刮西風」。已成了多數公敎人員的感嘆。但是公敎人員，寗可望穿淚眼，還是希望毛毯去而復來。</p>
<h3>羊毛毯飮泣呼冤</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>請澈查真相</p>
<p>爲公敎人員通緝羊毛毯歸案法辦一案，會佈諸八日本刊。實含寃莫伸，苦衷難宣；通緝令下，惶恐奚如！爲此不得不將下情，向公務人員等辯訴如下。伏祈垂鑒，以期沉寃大白—澈查眞相，藉明責任所在！</p>
<p>竊羊毛毯蠶身有契，議價有據；原期永作公敎人員終身陪侍，白頭偕老，以示溫存—，詎料原媒物資供應機構，心存回測，中途起意，以羊毛毯稍其姿色，價賣平康；非出自動，實乃被逼！身不由主，含此沉寃！未敢有遠信義，而生貳志！實出原媒翻戲，從中漁利！</p>
<p>今羊毛毯失身於人，白璧有玷！人言可畏，極願跳出火坑！曾數向原媒交涉，誠意從良（公敎人員），奈刁媒作祟，竟以高價贖身相誘脅！以羊毛毯弱不禁風之姿，非敢匹敵；祇得含寃飲泣，有誰矜憐？如公敎人員等眷念羊毛毯之溫存多情？不妨訴刁媒背的之嫌，拐騙羊毛毯墮入平康之罪！一旦公審有日，羊毛毯當到堂作證，藉懲奸刁，以抒羣憤，合亟泣寃如上，幸乞澈查，實爲辛甚！</p>
<p>美國毛毯謹啓</p>
<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<h3>叫花子的組織　18</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謹</p>
<p>真假旅客</p>
<p>本地丐幫膠着在上海市面，雖努力求生，無孔不入；但終年蓬頭垢面，菜色鳩形。殊非丈夫之志。於是一般少壯之流，決意另覓蹊徑，實規其「男兒志在四方」的本色。此輩丐流，抱着遠大志願，居然遠走高飛，開始其旅行生涯。這便是丐幫中所謂「撩風箏」的新路綫。但是此種生路，仍舊不脫詐欺手法。「撩風箏」乃是走舟軍之謂。上海交通利便，水陸路綫，密如蛛綱。本幫丐流，却能利用時會，可以常川來往各處而不費分文。而且每次出門，都有「撩扒」（　錢也）的把握。非有獨當一面的真本領，怎能夠赤手成家呢？</p>
<p>船上表演</p>
<p>此輩每日　充旅客乘船，衣冠却相當整潔，不露　三本色。等到客齊船開，於是開始其哭笑兼有的本領、先向鄰座的旅客寒喧問訊，漸漸地談及己事，於是信口捏造過去的身份，如原在故鄕從商，不料突來患難，店業破產，妻亡子散。好像人生苦痛，都叢集於一身。於是問船旅客圍聚問訊，恭聆他的演說。中國人向來　厚成性，尤其是旅中多暇，好管閒事。大家萍水相逢，格外惑到親切。不久十百相傳，大家不免都引起惻隱之心。丐流認爲良機莫失，要乞求大衆佈施。這時大家便會慷慨解囊。片刻間集數已有可觀。等到查票員前來，查得無票。衆旅客便會爲他求情，予以優待。於是丐流不但免費乘船，而且滿載而歸。明天另乘一條輪船回滬，又可以依樣葫蘆，再來一次悲劇搬演了。久後不免被船員看穿伎倆，於是不得不施賄賂以塞彼輩之口。有時甚至需分配潤澤，方可無事。但是無論如何，祇需一月旅行幾次，那收入的總數，却遠勝於鄭躅街頭的同輩多多了。</p>
<p>此類「撩風箏」的活劇，以川走長江的輪船上最多。其次爲川走寗波紹興的海輪上。原來上海寗紹同鄕會，定有規章對於流落滬上的窮苦同鄉，得由同鄕會　予回里船　。丐流　充同鄉前來，但志不在船票，而在　到一封介紹信。信中註明回里後可向某處領洋兩元（戰前之實况）。而在船上又可恃精彩表演而得厚利。維想到同鄕會的優待辦法，反造成了丐流的滑頭生意呢？</p>
<p>車站活劇</p>
<p>除了水路的「海裏山」（輪船也）外，問樣還活動於火軍站上。幫中人呼火車爲「飛百脚」。但在火車上却不能回座客求助，因爲同車客的感情極爲淡薄，比不到「同舟共濟」的船上客來得親切。而且一張四等車票也決賴不掉。他們須到目的地下車後，在車站上旅客擁　　車時，再開始其哭笑的表演伎倆。要求旅客們資助。一個車站上每天有好幾班客車來往着。旅客也源源不斷，丐流可以一天在甲站上活動，次日却又乘車到乙站上去。雖然風塵僕僕，跋涉辛苦。但入款却很可觀。這便是「撩風箏」幫出碼頭的新路綫。</p>
<h3>假使我辦一個黨</h3>
<p>— 谷</p>
<p>假使我辦一個黨，首先，我一定取一個最好的名字：「平等自由民主黨。」也許有人以爲這個名字太長，但因爲要切合實際的需要，一定得如此。</p>
<p>然後，我必需發表一篇宣言，表示本黨是在民間成長起來的，所以，我們一定能代表眞正的民意。本黨的政策是基於「平等自由民主」的，所以一定處處爲人民着想。這篇宣言不必長，但「人民」兩字必需儘量多說。</p>
<p>只要稍微有了些「幹部」，那我一定聲稱本黨黨員遍佈全中國，數額大得驚人——驚如說，本黨已有黨員二萬萬零一個人。這樣，可以證明本黨是代表了「大部份」的「民意」。</p>
<p>有了這樣大數額的黨員，當然應該做些事情，因爲本黨的宗旨是「一切爲人民」呀！</p>
<p>因此，我就向政府請求在國府組織裏，　　任用我們的黨員。行政院院　要，立法院院長要，小此的姐　政　部長，也要！應多愈好。不　寫文章的時候，則應調一句話：「甘爲　　恥　二官。」</p>
<p>政府答應，那麼做了官再說；（本黨是有進取的情神的！）似使不能盡如人意，那麼，這是　政府不民主，我們自行組織可也。</p>
<p>我的黨一定飛黃騰達，黨員一定　有官做，而且，「一切爲人民」！　員「不宜」？</p>
<h3>雙十二話西安</h3>

<h3>Debate on the Capital City Issue Unfolds: Applause Fills the First Review Committee; Zhang Ji Firmly Favors Establishing the Capital in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The most attention-grabbing issue in the constitution draft, the capital city issue, unfolded into a heated debate in the First Review Committee on the 11th at noon. Zhang Ji took the lead in advocating for establishing the capital in Beiping, while Liu Baimin was the spokesperson for advocating for establishing the capital in Nanjing. Social notable Qiu Ao put forward a third proposition, suggesting establishing it in the most difficult Xi'an. Each presented powerful arguments, and from 4:15 PM to 6:00 PM, discussions lasted nearly two hours, yet no final conclusion was reached. It was decided to continue discussions at 9:00 AM on the 12th, where another fierce debate is feared to take place. Zhang Zhiben announced the discussion of the seventh article regarding the capital city in the general outline immediately after the discussion of the national flag issue. The entire venue burst into applause, and the atmosphere shifted from silence to heated discussion. Zhang Jiyan, the representative from Liaoning advocating for establishing the capital in Beiping, was the first to speak. He believed that this issue was about determining the capital, not simply establishing it, and hoped everyone could act with conscience and consider the nation and its people. He then pointed out the advantages of establishing the capital in Beiping from a historical perspective, using the Ming and Qing dynasties as examples to illustrate that establishing the capital in Beiping would lead to long-term national stability. In contrast, Emperor Wu of Liang in Nanjing and the Republic of China experienced many internal and external troubles. Geographically, Beiping is also more advantageous for defense, unlike Nanjing which is vulnerable to threats. He also explained that the Japanese coveted the Northeast because the government was far away in Nanjing, unable to attend to North China, let alone take care of the Northeast, which led to the September 18th Incident. The next to speak was Qiu Ao. Although he was from Hunan, for the sake of the overall situation, he strongly advocated for establishing the capital in Xi'an. His reason was that the capital should be located in the most difficult and most in-need-of-relief area. The Northwest is becoming increasingly barren and its population is decreasing. We should not be greedy for the comfort of Nanjing or Beiping and forget the Northwest. Please do not forget the ancient adage that "sorrow produces strength." At this point, veteran party member Zhang Ji spoke, and the entire venue applauded warmly. Zhang first stated that the capital city is the most important and concrete issue in the entire constitution, and hoped that people would not act impulsively. This is not a North-South dispute, nor is it a factional dispute. The Kuomintang has not yet made a decision on this, so there is ample room for discussion. He analyzed the proposals related to the capital city issue, believing that only a very small minority advocated for establishing the capital in Nanjing, while the vast majority favored establishing it in Beiping. He hoped that the will of the majority would not be violated. Zhang explained Dr. Sun Yat-sen's original intention to establish the capital in Nanjing, stating: "I can confidently say that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy for establishing the capital in Nanjing was a temporary matter, not permanent. From the perspective of environment and reality, I support establishing the capital in Beiping. Some oppose establishing the capital there because it is close to a strong neighbor and may not be safe. However, we should know the ancient saying that 'danger begets strength'; the more dangerous it is, the more we should move there. Even General Chen Cheng, our military authority, also shares this view when I recently spoke with him. If we establish the capital in Nanjing again, we will surely perish as a nation." Upon these words, everyone applauded loudly. He Sui, the original proposer who advocated not specifying the location of the capital in the constitution, spoke, believing that the constitution is permanent and should not include the fluid issue of the capital city. In this atomic age, if there is a war, Nanjing would have to relocate its capital, and so would Beiping. It is better not to specify it. The representative from Hebei refuted the idea of establishing the capital in Nanjing with a humorous tone, stating that Dr. Sun Yat-sen established the capital in Nanjing because the feudal color there was too strong, the warlord forces were deeply rooted, and there were foreign influences. Currently, all of the above have been swept away, and representatives from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces have jointly signed this proposal, showing that it is not only the opinion of northern representatives. He said that there is no need to construct houses, as the Beiping government offices could be used after relocating to Beiping, and explained that even if there are practical difficulties, the constitution will not be immediately implemented after it is decided, but rather delayed. Sun Chunwu, the representative from Beiping, and Qi Bihou, the representative from Suiyuan, spoke on behalf of two hundred million people from three ethnicities, advocating for establishing the capital in Beiping. Wu Xiaodao, based on border and national defense reasons, advocated for establishing the capital in Nanjing, and explained the difficulties of moving the capital, saying that deciding now but not moving immediately is equivalent to issuing a blank check. He Yangling said that the charter stipulates establishing the capital in Nanjing, and all parties have agreed to it, explaining that history is not a strong enough justification for establishing the capital in Beiping, while the three revolutionary governments of Emperor Taizu of Ming, Hong Xiuquan, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen all established their capitals in Nanjing. Ren Zhuoxuan believed that the capital city is one thing, and foreign troubles are another. Establishing the capital in Beiping has also resulted in loss of sovereignty and humiliation. This matter should be blamed on the government, not on the location. Liu Baimin refuted Zhang Ji's theory, believing that Dr. Sun Yat-sen not only temporarily advocated for establishing the capital in Nanjing, but also had a permanent plan to establish the capital in Nanjing in his industrial plan. Nanjing is truly a revolutionary capital, and he asked everyone to remember the Nanjing Massacre. The heated debate continued until 6:00 PM, and those requesting to speak were still eager, so it was decided to continue the discussion on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Second Review Committee Passes Resolution: Defining the Powers of the National Assembly; The National Assembly is the Highest Organ for Exercising Political Power</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Second Review Committee of the constitutional draft held its fourth plenary session in the Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM on the 11th, attended by 257 representatives. Chairman Zhang Qiang first reported that the organization of the proposals had not yet been completed, and expressed his deep apologies. Shao Lizi then suggested, in order to save time, to forgo merging and organizing the extensive opinions, and instead directly discuss the proposals. Once the organization work is completed, they can be quickly put to a vote. Kong Geng and others immediately objected, saying that not only should the extensive opinions from the past be organized together, but extensive discussions should continue. The representatives then spoke one after another until the meeting was adjourned at 11:50 AM.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:40 PM in the Assembly Hall, attended by 211 representatives. Chairman Zhu Hongru began to discuss the "National Assembly" chapter of the constitutional draft, article by article. Most of the representatives believed that the nature of the National Assembly must be stipulated. Despite Shao Lizi and Tao Xisheng's strong advocacy for discussing based on the constitutional draft, the assembly still passed a resolution to add "The National Assembly is the highest organ of the Republic of China for the people to exercise political power" at the beginning of the chapter, as Article 26. The original Article 26 was postponed to become Article 27, and was partially revised to "The National Assembly shall be organized by the following representatives: (1) Each county, city, and equivalent area shall elect one representative. For every 300,000 people over that, an additional representative shall be elected; (2) The quota for the Mongolian banners, Tibetan areas, and ethnic minorities shall be determined separately by law." The provisions for legislative and supervisory committee members to be representatives of the National Assembly were all deleted. Due to insufficient time, the provisions for overseas Mongolian and overseas Chinese representatives were left for discussion on the 12th. The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Review of "President" Chapter of Constitutional Draft Completed</h3>
<p>The Third Review Committee Continued Its Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Third Review Committee of the constitutional draft held its 41st plenary session at 9:00 AM on the 11th, attended by 112 representatives. Chairman Shi Shangkuan continued to discuss the articles of the "President" chapter of the constitutional draft. Article 44 was revised to "In the event of a national emergency, natural disaster (the words 'epidemic diseases' are deleted below), or a major change in the national finances or economy that requires rapid action, the President, during the recess of the Legislative Yuan, may issue emergency decrees based on the Emergency Decree Law after a resolution by the Executive Yuan, to take necessary measures, but must submit them to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within one month after the issuance of the decrees. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree, the emergency decrees shall immediately become invalid." In addition, Articles 45 to 53, totaling nine articles, were all passed to maintain the original text. The review of Chapter 4 was thus completed, and the meeting was adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] When the Third Review Committee of the constitutional draft held its third meeting on the 10th, it conducted a detailed discussion of the articles of Chapter 4 "President." Except for Articles 36, 37, 40, 42, and 43, which were passed as is, Article 38 was discussed at length due to its significant implications. Article 39 was revised to "The President shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution (the five words 'Article Sixty-Third' were deleted), exercise the power to conclude treaties and declare war and peace." Article 41 was revised to "The President shall exercise the power to grant (the words 'general amnesty' were deleted) (special amnesty, commutation, and restoration of rights) in accordance with the law (the second item 'The Minister of Judicial Administration shall submit the aforementioned matters concerning special amnesty, commutation, and restoration of rights to the President for approval in accordance with the law' was completely deleted)." Article 44, due to the issue involving the Legislative Yuan's recess, did not immediately reach a conclusion and was deferred for discussion on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Vacancy of the Premier of the Executive Yuan: Deputy Premier to Act as Agent</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Third Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Third Review Committee of the constitutional draft continued its meeting at 3:40 PM in the First Lounge, still chaired by Shi Shangkuan, attended by 109 representatives. It began the review of Chapter 5 "Executive" of the constitutional draft amendments. Articles 54 and 55 were passed smoothly. After an hour of heated discussion, Article 56 was passed according to the amendment proposed by Wang Shijie, adding the provision that the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act as the agent during the Premier's vacancy, modifying it to "The Premier of the Executive Yuan shall be nominated by the President and appointed with</p>
<h3>The Stormy Waters of the Review Committee</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter</p>
<p>——Argument · Walkout · News Reporters Barred</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] When the First Review Committee discussed Article One, a point regarding Ying Wu Gong Hang sparked a huge uproar, with Youth Party members nearly walking out. Min Da, Zhou Dou San, and others, wearing hats and carrying books, prepared to leave, but were stopped by other representatives. Li Junfu of the Democratic Socialist Party, who demanded to walk out yesterday, again caused a scene today because the representatives would not allow him to report, but he was persuaded to stay by those nearby.</p>
<p>When discussing whether sovereignty belongs to "the people" or "the citizens," a certain Guangdong representative and Wu Jingxiong spoke extensively about English women, while Chen Guyuan spoke at length about the source of sovereignty, leading some to say that today's meeting felt like attending a "comparative constitutional law" class in college.</p>
<p>Jiang Wanping's words were the most amusing. He said, "Fellow members are attending the National Assembly as citizen representatives, so why does the constitution use 'the people' instead of 'the citizens'?" His words brought the house down in laughter.</p>
<p>Representative Wu Yanhuan said that territory must never be altered, and if there are any more territorial losses, our ancestors in the afterlife will surely curse us as "not being good descendants."</p>
<p>Female representative Guo Changhe vehemently opposed the enumerated method of listing territories, saying, "We must also recover our past lands, such as Hong Kong. The nation's territory cannot be forfeited by this National Assembly!"</p>
<p>When the Second Review Committee convened, there was another "extensive discussion." The elder Kong Geng spoke for over ten minutes. Youth Party representative Zhu Ruixi stood up and asked Chairman Zhang Qiang to be mindful of speaking time. Old Kong flew into a rage, and his dozen or so cronies also jumped up and rushed towards Zhu's seat from all directions, pointing fingers and verbally condemning him, almost leading to violence. Chairman Zhang shouted for "order" to quell the all-out brawl. Under the sympathy of the majority, Representative Zhu sat silently for a while and then walked out. Old Kong then jumped onto the stage again and said, "Just now, a certain representative interfered with my right to speak, causing disorder. It is truly a case of 'one dog barking at shadows, and a hundred dogs barking in response'..." The entire assembly felt uneasy, and he started shaking his head and spouting his "grand theories" again.</p>
<p>Article 45 of the Presidential Chapter, regarding the president's power to convene meetings of relevant Yuan heads to resolve disputes between the Yuans, was debated in the Political Consultative Conference's draft constitution review. The Democratic Socialist Party ultimately conceded. Unexpectedly, differing opinions arose again among the Kuomintang representatives in the Third Review Committee. Wang Shijie and Luo Ding advocated for deletion, while Pan Gongzhan argued for retention. After voting, the original proposal was maintained with 44 votes, a majority, and Pan won the battle.</p>
<p>Representative He Fuqing from the Henan area once again delivered witty remarks about the "reserve president," how this and that. Representative Zhang Ziyang from Hebei immediately stood up and said, "This delegate opposes the opinion of this representative. A 'reserve president' is not necessary. If we are going to elect a 'reserve president,' then we might as well elect a 'honorary president,' and so on!" As a result, a vote was held. The first time, only He himself supported the "reserve president." The second time, Li Jingzhai, who originally proposed the motion, smilingly raised his hand. The witty proposal for a "reserve president" was declared finished.</p>
<p>The First National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Seventh Review Committee suddenly refused reporters access this morning. A reporter asked, "Is this a closed-door meeting? If so, we won't push our way in." A military policeman replied, "Don't know? In any case, you're not allowed to enter." "Can we ask the staff member?" "No, no news reporter is allowed through this door." "Then whose order is it? Platoon leader? Battalion commander? Section chief?" "None of those. It's 'the higher-up.'" Upon asking their "higher-up," it turned out to be Chairman Leng Xin's silent order. After inquiring about the content of the discussion, it seemed completely ordinary. No one could say what was a "national defense secret" or a "foreign affairs secret."</p>
<p>When Kong Geng was losing his temper, Lai Lian came out from the Education and Culture Subcommittee meeting and stood in the hall, observing. He smiled and shook his head. When reporters looked at him, he quickly went back to the meeting.</p>
<p>Before the national capital issue was brought up at the First Review Committee in the afternoon, the entire venue first applauded enthusiastically, as if before the start of a good play. Zhang Pu's speech repeatedly earned more than 30 rounds of applause, like Mei Lanfang's closing performance. The debate between those who advocated for Beijing and those who advocated for Nanjing resembled a Peking opera and Shanghai opera companies performing against each other in a national drama. Finally, the disruption ended with a female representative walking out, almost leading to a brawl. From beginning to end, it resembled an "all-star revue."</p>
<p>When discussing the national capital issue, the representatives spoke their fill about geographical terms and historical lessons, completely different from their constant talk of "sovereignty" and "national rights" in the morning. One representative said that the morning felt like a constitutional law class, while the afternoon felt like a geography and history class.</p>
<p>Zhang Ji Yan fought for the Beijing faction, speaking fluently and being very familiar with place names. He believed that if there was no issue with the national capital, it could not be specified. Since there was an issue, it must be expressly stipulated. He also said that some people oppose returning the capital due to economic difficulties. Their reason is as insufficient as opposing the convening of the National Assembly due to economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Qiu Bi, a respected figure from Hunan, did not advocate for establishing the capital in Changsha, but instead proposed establishing it in Xi'an. He believed that for the sake of the overall situation, we should choose the worst and most difficult location and should not build the capital in comfortable, spacious Nanjing or Beijing.</p>
<p>Elder statesman Zhang Pu's speech lasted more than 15 minutes. He first stated, "I am not trying to show off my intelligence." According to what I know, establishing the capital in Nanjing was not Dr. Sun Yat-sen's original idea. Dr. Sun's advocacy for establishing the capital in Nanjing was a temporary idea, not a permanent one. Finally, he pointed out with grief that if the capital is re-established in Nanjing, national ruin is inevitable. After the speech, applause lasted for a long time.</p>
<p>Lai Jianjun, a representative from Chongqing, spoke in a Sichuan accent, hoping that the capital would not forget Chongqing, the wartime capital. Lai said sadly that Chongqing was bombed by the enemy for years, but never yielded. The words "wartime capital" were written in blood.</p>
<p>Wu Yanhuan, who refuted establishing the capital in Nanjing, said, "If Dr. Sun were still alive today, he would definitely advocate for establishing the capital in Beijing." The entire assembly burst into laughter. He opposed establishing the capital in Nanjing because Dr. Sun's mausoleum is in Nanjing. According to him, "The Chinese nation's ancestor is the Yellow Emperor, and his mausoleum is far away in a desolate county in central Shaanxi. Does that mean we must build the capital in central Shaanxi? Some say that moving the capital to the front line is actually to escape to Lushan for summer. The money spent on that is not a small amount either."</p>
<p>Liu Baimin sang the closing act, strongly advocating for establishing the capital in Nanjing. His most brilliant remark was that today is the 11th, and the day after tomorrow is the 13th, the anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese. How many compatriots died for Nanjing to be the capital? Nanjing being the capital was written in blood. Another representative also pointed out that although Nanjing was not able to defend itself for long during the war of resistance, the fall of Beijing preceded the fall of Nanjing. We cannot not establish the capital in Nanjing because Nanjing once fell.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 11th] After the National Army attacked and entered the south gate of Yancheng in northern Jiangsu, it is currently engaged in street battles.

There is an urgent need for 1 billion yuan in relief funds and a large quantity of cotton clothing, because the people's cotton clothing in the territory of these two counties has been completely requisitioned by the Communist troops. The people have to wear burlap mourning clothes for the winter, and their situation is extremely miserable.</p>

<h3>Director of the UNRRA Henan Branch Reports, Yellow River Dam Closing Will Be Completed, UNRRA Representative Says Conditions in the Flooded Area are Terrible</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Ma Jie, Director of the UNRRA Henan Branch, Wester, a UNRRA representative, and Song Tong, Director of Construction of Henan Province, jointly hosted reporters at UNRRA yesterday afternoon to report on the situation of the Yellow River flood area restoration project. Mr. Wei reported first, stating briefly that the Yellow River dam closing project will be completed soon, but the final purpose of dam closing is to restore the old course, revive the Yellow River flood area, and enable the people in the area to live and work in peace. Ma also stated that there are three reasons why UNRRA is so eager to rush to repair the breach: (1) The breach was caused by the war. Now that the war is over, refugees should no longer be allowed to drift about. They should be stabilized as soon as possible. (2) If it is not repaired quickly at this time, some of the fertile land in the area will no longer be able to produce and will become wasteland. (3) The land on both sides of the Yellow River is fertile and suitable for cultivation. If it is not remedied, the food supply in the area will be quite problematic. After the restoration is completed, the area can provide an experimental site for machine cultivation. However, this work is not easy, and problems such as child welfare, transportation, and hygiene are difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Mr. Wester also said that the conditions in the Yellow River flood area are very terrible. This kind of great flood only occurred in Roman times in world history, and it took two thousand years to complete the treatment. The complex situation of the American TVA can be compared with the Yellow River, but its social situation is not as chaotic as China's. Mr. Wei reported the results of the Yellow River flood area survey: the area occupies a total of 16.5 million mu, of which 7.5 million mu are in Henan Province. 90,000 mu of land are covered with weeds and must be reorganized before they can be cultivated. At the same time, according to a survey, Fugou County in the area had a population of 320,000 in 1938, but only 44,000 people were left a year and a half ago. Most of the remaining population had fled, were scattered, or died in the disaster. Currently, it has increased to 140,000 people, all of whom have returned home from various places, about 500 people per week, but they still cannot solve the problems of food, clothing, and shelter after returning home.</p>
<p>Finally, Song Tong reported that the Henan Provincial Government is extremely concerned about this disaster and has specially organized a guidance committee to assist the returning residents in carrying out various affairs, and to find ways to resolve land ownership issues. Since the committee received relief supplies from UNRRA, great progress has been made in the work of promoting the area.</p>
<h3>Dong Biwu's Talk</h3>
<p>Points to Unequal Distribution of Relief Supplies</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Dong Biwu spoke to reporters on the evening of the 11th about the distribution of relief supplies, saying: (1) Of the 15 branches of the Relief Administration nationwide, eight are related to the Communist areas, accounting for 69 percent of the population, but the relief supplies they receive account for only 10 percent of what they should receive, which is unfair. Mr. Lei, the former head of the UNRRA office in China, also said this, calling the ratio "an unsightly conclusion." Jiang Tingbi and Mr. Lei had planned to improve this situation but failed. The current new director, Eggerton, also plans to improve it, and Huo Doushu has repeatedly stated that there should be no discrimination due to party affiliation, but the unfair phenomenon has been established. A news report stated that Huo Doushu made a three-point statement, believing that the reason why the distribution of materials to the Communist areas is less is that most of the materials shipped are food, and the Communist areas are producing areas, which is inconsistent with the facts. For example, the Jin-Chahar-Hebei area only produces black beans, while the Hunan-Jiangxi area is a grain-producing army, but relief supplies are still distributed there, so this matter should be carefully handled. (2) UNRRA's 30-odd tons of heavy machinery should not be distributed to the Communist areas, but in fact, there are still some light machines that have not been distributed. (3) Regarding the Yellow River dam closing, UNRRA has inspected the projects completed by the Communist areas, but the dangerous projects cannot be done due to lack of funding.</p>
<h3>Cotton Clothing is Thin and Rotten, How Can it Resist the Cold?</h3>
<p>Poor People in Hankou March to Petition</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 11th] More than 300 poor people in Hankou marched to the relevant agencies yesterday because the winter clothing issued by the relief branch here was thin and rotten and could not be used. They hung the tattered clothes they received on bamboo poles, writing "Thank You, Relief Branch" on them, and marched along Zhongshan Avenue, causing onlookers to gather.</p>
<h3>The US Establishes a Consulate in Harbin, Rejected by the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Chinese Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan officially informed the US Embassy this afternoon that, on the orders of Yan'an, the Chinese Communists will refuse US Consul General to Harbin, Clubb, to enter Harbin, as the area is a military zone. He also said that if it were peacetime, Mr. Clubb would have been allowed to go. When asked whether Yan'an's refusal of the US consul to enter Harbin was related to the Chinese Communists' usual accusation that the US was aiding the government, he replied that Yan'an had not replied in this way.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The State Department confirmed today the report that "the Chinese Communists will prevent the US government from establishing a consulate in Harbin." A State Department spokesman said that US Consul General Clubb had waited patiently for eight months for the Communist Party to allow him to go to Harbin to establish a consulate, but because he was finally not allowed by the Communist Party, he is currently still performing his consular duties in Changchun.</p>
<h3>Various Election Issues in the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>(3) Women and Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>According to Article 129 of the draft constitution, "Citizens of the Republic of China who have reached the age of 20 have the right to vote in accordance with the law. Except as otherwise provided in this constitution and laws, those who have reached the age of 23 have the right to be elected in accordance with the law." Chapter 2, Article 8 also stipulates that "Citizens of the Republic of China are equal under the law regardless of gender..." However, in this proposal, there are still some election-related issues related to women.</p>
<p>Representative Chen Guyuan and 62 others proposed adding a proviso to Article 130, "Candidates for various elections stipulated in this constitution shall openly campaign:" "However, regarding the election of representatives to the National Assembly and members of the Legislative and Supervisory Committees, the law should stipulate the minimum number of women elected." The reason is that in today's patriarchal society, men will surely win in open elections between men and women. Therefore, historically, we have always stipulated a minimum number of women elected to avoid the name of equality between men and women becoming an empty one. The British Parliament also has provisions for women. Representative Wei Tingsheng and 52 others proposed in Case 86 to add "representatives elected by women's organizations" under Article 26, "The National Assembly is organized by the following national representatives." They believe that this can prevent women from suffering losses when competing with men, and say that "women's problems must be solved by women."</p>
<p>The recently deceased female representative Liu Chunyi also proposed with Ni Guifu and 33 other representatives to add "the number of women among the various candidates stipulated in this party law shall not be less than 30%" after Article 130. This is more specific than the proposal of Chen Guyuan and others. As for why it is stipulated to be more than 30%, the original proposal did not explain.</p>
<p>Another election-related issue in this 100-odd proposal is whether overseas Chinese have the right to elect Supervisory Committee members. According to the provisions of Article 26, paragraph 1, item 2 and Article 95 of the draft constitution, overseas Chinese do not have the right to elect Supervisory Committee members. There are four proposals requesting supplementation submitted by Chen Shuren and others, for the following reasons: (1) Article 65 of the draft constitution stipulates the allocation of the number of Legislative Committee members, and includes "citizens residing abroad," but the allocation of the number of Supervisory Committee members lacks this item, so it is proposed to add it; (2) Overseas Chinese are frank and outspoken and are good at impeachment and supervision; (3) According to the provisions of Article 26, members of the Blue Committee and members of the Legislative Committee have the same qualifications, that is, they simultaneously have the qualifications of representatives to the National Assembly. Therefore, their method of generation should be the same as that of other representatives of the Legislative and Blue Committees, and they should be directly elected by the people. However, Article 26, paragraph 1, item 2 and Article 96 stipulate that the Supervisory Committee members are an exception and are indirectly elected by parliament. The nature of the differing laws should be uniform and the people should directly elect them.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the election issues involved in the proposal also include (1) direct elections vs. indirect elections, (2) whether the National Assembly representatives have the power to elect important officials other than the president and vice president, (3) whether incumbent officials can participate in the National Assembly representative election before being dismissed or approved, (4) the age of voters and candidates, (5) the election of National Assembly representatives in municipalities, etc. It is believed that there will be heated discussions on these issues in the review committee.

<h3>Another Incident Occurs in Hanoi: Five Overseas Chinese Shot Dead; Clashes Between French and Vietnamese Continue, Uprooting Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] Since the 23rd of last month, railway and highway traffic from Hanoi to Haiphong has been interrupted and has never resumed. As a result, transportation problems have become the most serious issue. An inspection by airplane revealed that the highway had been damaged at several points and that many railway tracks were also damaged and unusable. Consequently, the only means of transportation between Hanoi and Haiphong is by airplane, preventing the transport of heavy goods, European food, and newly arrived luggage from France. It was also learned that an incident occurred tonight about ten kilometers northeast of Hanoi, where five overseas Chinese were reportedly shot dead by Vietnamese people, further straining relations between the overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] Sino-French Conflict in Haiphong; Viewing China's Neutrality, As of yesterday, investigations revealed that over 800 overseas Chinese had been killed, injured, missing, or arrested, with property losses exceeding 29 million Vietnamese currency. Displacement and heartbreaking scenes spread the atmosphere of violence to various parts of Hanoi. The French side is determined to resolve the situation in Vietnam by force, while the Vietnamese side insists that French troops must return to their original stationed areas in Haiphong and Lang Son as before November 20th before negotiations can begin. Both sides are taking extreme measures and preparing for imminent conflict. Regarding our request for the demarcation of a neutral zone and effective protection of overseas Chinese, there are still no concrete measures in place.</p>
<h3>Wartime Losses of Private Factories Can Be Compensated by the Executive Yuan and Ministry; Industrial Association to Participate in the Committee on Japanese Reparations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the compensation for wartime losses of private factories in our country and the Industrial Association sending representatives to participate in the Committee on Japanese Reparations, the authorities have agreed. Representatives from the China National Industries Association and the Shanghai Industries Association, including Chairman Wu Yunchu, Executive Directors Hu Boxiang, Jin Runxiang, and Tang Xuzhi, met with Vice President of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao and Director Wu Chengluo and Chief Secretary Xu Baiqi of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 11th to discuss the matter. Vice President Weng assured that wartime losses of private factories could be compensated by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry and that the China National Industries Association could send representatives to participate in the Committee on Japanese Reparations to handle Japan's reparations to China. Weng also entrusted the Industrial Association with collecting data on the wartime losses of private factories nationwide for the government's reference. Furthermore, as the four representatives felt that their petition objectives had been achieved, except for Wu who remained in Nanjing to participate in the National Assembly, the rest would return to Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The City's Budget for Next Year</h3>
<p>The revenue listed in the city's budget for the 36th year is 210,193,981,125 yuan, and the total expenditure is 523,675,917,990 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 313,481,936,775 yuan. This deficit is already alarming. It is reported that the actual revenue figure, according to the city government's consultations, is only 190,800,000,000 yuan, in which items such as house tax and banquet tax are even estimated according to the current tax rates, not using the standards stipulated by the central government. Therefore, according to the most conservative estimate, the revenue is said to be only 110 billion yuan. In that case, the deficit would be more than 410 billion yuan, exceeding the actual revenue by about three times and exceeding the revenue agreed upon by the city government by more than double!</p>
<p>The city government's response is to adopt the principle of living within its means, which means calculating roughly double the budget for the second half of this year, totaling 214,017,433,470 yuan, and then considering further austerity measures to reach the assumed figure of 190.8 billion. The remaining new items that need to be handled will be budgeted separately and new sources of revenue will be sought separately. In other words, things will be done if there is money, and not done if there is no money; as much as can be done with the available funds. It is reported that the target for this new source of revenue is likely to be government bonds.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Even a skilled housewife cannot cook without rice." In reality, with only this much money, naturally only this many things can be done. The city government is not racking its brains to raise funds in every possible way, but is realistically maintaining the status quo and adhering to the principle of living within its means, which is largely worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Currently, local finances are all suffering from deficits. There are naturally many complex reasons for this, but the idea of carrying out all kinds of projects and trying to maintain appearances in many ways is the main cause of the deficits and their expansion. The reason for this is that the heads of various agencies, driven by a sense of responsibility, naturally want to do as much as possible in their areas of responsibility and harbor the ambition of doing everything at once. In addition, the instructions of superiors, the resolutions of long-term planning bodies, and the suggestions from various parties make it necessary to address all of them and proceed concurrently. As a result, important financial factors are relegated to secondary status. In order to reverse this trend and make up for the budget shortfall, there is no other way except for the highest officials of each ministry or locality to weigh the importance of things from time to time and in different places and make overall plans. For example, this time the revenue of Shanghai is limited to 190.8 billion, while the expenditure to maintain the status quo requires 214 billion. Judging from the figures, it seems that the income and expenditure are still insufficient. In fact, the budgets originally made by each unit (for the second half of the 35th year) were not very realistic. Originally, when preparing the budget and the plan for administration, they wanted to do as many things as possible and ask for as much money as possible. However, when the budget was finalized, many of the planned works could not be started due to various reasons, and as a result, many funds were frozen in the treasury and could not be withdrawn. Yesterday, a source told me that one-third of the expenses for a certain agency's projects had not been used. If this is reliable, then doubling the expenses for the second half of this year and using it as the expenditure budget for next year still needs to be discounted. Because although this is ostensibly maintaining the status quo, it still carries some idealism.</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan has recently resolved separately that the tax rates for house tax and banquet tax are much lower than the current rates in this city. At a time when the city's finances are suffering a huge deficit, if we say that the taxes should be collected according to the central government's tax rates, it seems like we are joking with the city's financial authorities and being too unreasonable. In fact, this is a matter of the rule of law, not just a matter of money. If, after legally reducing taxes, there is indeed not enough revenue to cover expenses, our ideal is to rather find other legal new sources of revenue to compensate for the loss than to openly disregard the laws of the central government.</p>
<p>We must also admit that the difference these few sums of money makes is not enough to overly affect the city's budget. What will affect the city's budget the most in the future is prices, not a partial reduction of taxes. If prices continue to rise next year, and civil servants' salaries still need to be adjusted every three months as usual, and the cost of various construction materials, purchases, repairs, etc., must also be increased at any time, then the originally planned 5% contingency fund and the 36 billion in cost-of-living allowances will probably still be insufficient.</p>
<p>Therefore, in times of peace, the figures in the budget are indeed worth paying attention to. In these extraordinary economic times, it is more practical to stabilize prices and resolve the crisis in industry and commerce than to meticulously calculate the balance of revenue and expenditure. Looking at the city's revenue table, the business tax, license tax, and wharf tax are closely related to the prosperity or decline of the city, but other taxes such as slaughter tax, banquet and entertainment tax, clan guild tax, all kinds of fees, public business income, house tax, and construction tax attached to public utilities are also related to the city's well-being. Therefore, the accuracy of the city's budget for next year does not lie in the currently estimated figures, but in the changes in prices and the city's economic conditions.</p>
<h3>Unjust Verdict in Shibuya Incident; Our Representative Raises Objections; Investigation Should Be Conducted into the Responsibility of Japanese Police</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Thirty-six of our compatriots arrested in the Shibuya Incident were sentenced this afternoon after half a month of investigation. Two were acquitted and released, one was sentenced to three years of hard labor, and the other thirty-three were sentenced to two years of hard labor. Taiwanese compatriots sentenced to prison will be deported and will not be allowed to return to Japan during the Allied occupation. Qiu, the Chinese member of the international tribunal consisting of two other American and French judges responsible for reviewing the Shibuya case, immediately raised an objection after the sentencing. Qiu vigorously stated: "The prosecutor's office cannot prove the guilt of the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt. This committee should make a decision, namely, to dismiss the plaintiff's case and acquit all the defendants." Qiu's objection immediately raised the question of whether the judgment was appropriate, since the three-member committee only obtained a two-thirds vote to determine the guilt of the defendants. It is reported that Zhu Shiming, the head of our delegation, and Shen Guanding will visit Acheson of the United States to discuss the sentencing in the Shibuya case. Shen will also raise the point regarding the responsibility of the Japanese police in the shooting incident on July 19, as the defendants have consistently denied the responsibility for firing the first shot in the incident that resulted in the death of six Taiwanese and the injury of more than twenty others. Japanese police testified in court that they used as many as 542 rounds of ammunition in the incident. According to the chairman of the three-member committee, the case will be submitted to the occupation authorities for review. Since the Shibuya incident occurred, our delegation in Japan has insisted on conducting a complete and fair investigation. Our representatives have been making continuous efforts to ensure that Taiwanese compatriots receive a fair trial and to clarify the responsibilities of both parties involved in the conflict. However, the investigation into the responsibility of the Japanese police has not yet been completed.</p>
<h3>National Army Demobilization Plan Affected by Political Situation</h3>
<p>Huang Jie Talks to Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] General Huang Jie, acting director of the Central Training Corps responsible for training demobilized army officers for employment, told reporters today that after the National Army completed the first phase of its demobilization plan from January to September this year, its current strength is about 150 divisions. General Huang also revealed that the speed of the National Army's demobilization has been greatly reduced due to the continued civil war and the unstable political situation. The second phase of demobilization, which was originally planned to begin after the completion of the first phase, is still in the planning stage but has in fact been postponed indefinitely. Huang said that according to the original plan and the provisions of the KMT-CPC troop reduction agreement, the army should be reduced to 90 divisions after the completion of the second phase of demobilization, and finally to 60 divisions by the end of next year.</p>

<h3>Gang of Thieves Uncovered in Bengbu; Bandits Recruit Followers Under False Names, Appointing Themselves Battalion and Regiment Commanders, Parading and Deceiving Everywhere</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Bengbu News] Since Bengbu City implemented winter defense, although military, police, and security agencies have stepped up their vigilance day and night, robbery cases have continued to occur. The Chen Yi family in Huangshan Bao, Xishi District, was robbed at night, and Chen's father, Zhao Hui, was strangled to death. Moreover, the Laofengxiang and Laotiandou silver shops were robbed of gold jewelry in broad daylight, showing the bandits' rampant behavior. Recently, during the military and police's investigation of the bandits, a group was uncovered that used false names, colluded with bandits, and secretly organized cart teams to commit crimes. The pseudo-regiment commander He Dongshan and more than ten suspects were arrested, dealing a major blow to the bandit gang that threatened security. According to the investigation, the details of the case are described as follows: A bandit named He Dongshan had long been colluding with local bandits in the Hongze area of eastern Anhui and wanted to bring them under his control. He was introduced to a man named Zhu Jiannong, who claimed to be a senior advisor to the Ministry of National Defense and often wore major general insignia and badges, traveling between Nanjing and Bengbu, posing as a high-ranking military officer. He sometimes worked at No. 9, Dainan Hotel, in this city. He Dongshan, Zhu Wei, and others colluded with him, declaring that they would recruit bandits from the Tianjia'an area of Hongze Lake and organize them into the 7th and 8th Anhui Security Regiments, appointing He Dongshan as the commander of the 7th Regiment, Cao Gan, first battalion commander of the regiment, Gu Yan, second battalion commander, Zhu Wei, third battalion commander, Shi Shurong, commander of the 8th Regiment, and Zhang Yuncheng, deputy battalion commander. Most of the main cadres were pre-determined. He and others set up a secret agency at No. 526, Erma Road, Bengbu. Those who used to work in miscellaneous troops and had connections with the authorities rushed to it, sometimes gathering in the agency, acting strangely, and moving vigorously. Li Boying, who had participated in puppet organizations and served as the commander of a puppet army detachment during the enemy-puppet period, also participated in the activities. Before long, He Dongshan was arrested by the police bureau on suspicion of banditry. The position of commander of the pseudo-7th Regiment was temporarily taken over by Zhang Yuncheng. Zhang, Li, and others still moved secretly, swaggering everywhere, attracting bandits, claiming to organize security regiments, and plotting wrongdoing. This was heard by the intelligence team of the political department of the Eighth Pacification District. They immediately notified the garrison team stationed in Bengbu to investigate. The team sent squad leader Zhang Huayu to disguise himself and infiltrate the pseudo-battalion commander Zhu Wei's unit, pretending to join forces and work together. After Zhang investigated for half a month, he learned the truth about the bandit gang using false names and stealing numbers. So he secretly reported to the military police team, which smashed the pseudo-agency and arrested the bandit gang Zhang Yuncheng, Shi Shurong, Cao Gan, Li Boying, Li Xingya, Zhang Zhiwu, Zhu Wei, Yan Junkui, Sun Jiantang, and a total of nineteen suspects. Then, they wrote to the police bureau to extradite He Dongshan to the team headquarters. After three days and nights of interrogation, He and others confessed to using false names, colluding with bandits, organizing troops, and plotting wrongdoing. Except for the suspects who were released on bail because they were not involved in the case, all the criminals were transferred to the headquarters of the Eighth Pacification District on the 7th for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Industries Struggle to Survive the Year-End; Banks Agree to Lend 5 Billion at the Lowest Interest Rate as Mortgage Loans</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] At the request of the Grains Trade Association, the Suzhou County Chamber of Commerce, citing the approach of the end of the year and the continued economic depression of the Rong business sector, believes that if relief is not sought quickly, the wave of commercial bankruptcies at the end of the year will be even more prevalent than in the past. The current crisis is lurking on all sides, and it is indeed urgent. The Chamber of Commerce gathered the chairmen of various industry associations on the 11th, invited all state-owned and commercial banks in the county to discuss emergency relief measures. In an atmosphere of mutual understanding, the banking community sincerely expressed its willingness to provide assistance. Therefore, a concrete plan has been obtained. The nature is mortgage loans, with a total amount of 5 billion, lent at the lowest interest rate. The various industry associations will organize a joint warehouse, which will be kept in the custody of the banking industry as collateral. As for the repayment period, it is tentatively set for two months, from the twelfth month of the lunar calendar to the end of the first month, so that various merchants can obtain relief during the lunar and solar new year periods, thereby surviving the peak period. This plan can be implemented as soon as the banking association agrees on the interest rate.</p>
<h3>Disputes over Suzhou City Council Elections Surface</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] The preliminary elections for city councilors from professional organizations in this county have come to a conclusion, with a total of more than 200 candidates produced for the second round of elections. The official election will be held at the end of this month to produce 43 county councilors. However, based on the views of various sectors of society, it is widely believed that the preparatory work for the preliminary elections was insufficient and hastily carried out, and as a result, there is no shortage of manipulation. Members of ten trade associations and member representatives have even seen newspaper reports exposing the preliminary election lists of their own organizations, yet they do not know how the winners of the preliminary elections were produced, and some even do not know the date and location of the preliminary elections. As a result, the tide of brewing disputes among various professional organizations has become increasingly acute. The first to break out was the boatmen's association. On the 11th, member representatives Zhao Xiaosizi and others submitted a petition to the Provisional City Council and the county government, revealing that there was no prior notice during the association's preliminary elections. Therefore, the three candidates Wang Duanzhang, Zhu Zhengan, and Chu Jinchun, who were produced for the second round of elections, cannot be recognized as having legal qualifications. Moreover, Wang Duanzhang and others are currently under investigation by the county government in another case, making it difficult for them to gain popular support. They requested a re-election. The Provisional City Council has now sent a letter to the county government for detailed investigation to demonstrate the seriousness of the election administration.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Asks for Loans to Purchase Grain to Prevent Food Shortages</h3>
<p>[Ningbo News] The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce recently received a message from Si Chiwen, a representative attending the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Joint Conference, stating that the United Relief Organization is willing to provide loans to food-deficient counties to purchase and store food grain for famine relief. After inviting people from all walks of life to discuss the implementation plan, the discussion resulted in a joint request from the Commissioner's Office, the county government, the City Council, the county party headquarters, and the Chamber of Commerce to the United Relief Organization for a loan of 1 billion yuan. After the request is approved, a meeting will be convened to discuss the organization of the governing body and all implementation matters.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Faces Many Difficulties in Collecting Military Grain</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] Jiangsu Province faces many difficulties in collecting military grain. Only 260,000 piculs of grain, equivalent to 130,000 piculs of rice, were collected in November. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Food, citing the Central Government's urgent need for grain, has telegraphed the four purchase and transportation stations in Xuzhou, Nanjing, Nantong, and Wuxi to quickly raise and allocate the grain. According to the investigation, the reasons for the difficulties are: (1) insufficient processing and production after collection, (2) inconvenient transportation, (3) too little transportation cost.</p>
<h3>Li Pinxian Receives American Medal and Citation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hefei, 11th] U.S. President Truman has awarded the Golden Leaf Medal of Freedom to Anhui Chairman Li Pinxian for his great help to the victory of the United Nations. The medal has been transferred to the province by the National Government. Truman also issued a citation, which reads: "General Li Pinxian, who has made significant contributions to the Allied war effort, should be awarded the Golden Leaf Medal of Freedom. Although his work, due to limitations of authority, did not directly help the Allied war effort, General Li Pinxian's wise leadership and personal efforts greatly helped the final victory of the United Nations." After receiving the medal and citation, Li Pinxian wrote a letter to President Truman, which reads: "To His Excellency President Truman: I am grateful for the Golden Leaf Medal of Freedom and the citation you have bestowed upon me. Under your wise leadership, we finally defeated our common enemy in this Allied war. However, our common goal after the war is to seek lasting peace for the entire world. Therefore, we deeply hope that the Chinese and American people can further strengthen their ties in the future and uphold the spirit of cooperation that we shared wholeheartedly during the war in order to achieve this common goal. I wish you and your wife good health. Sincerely, Li Pinxian."</p>
<h3>New Seed Households on Chongming North Bank Are All Abolished</h3>
<p>Years of Disputes Can Be Considered Concluded</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongming News] In recent years, many newly formed fields have emerged along the north bank of this county. The total area that can be cultivated reaches more than 2,000 acres, and they are all fertile fields. During the fall of Chongming Island, some people paid the government for land reclamation and registered the fields. After the Japanese surrendered last autumn and the country was recovered, they jointly organized a land reclamation agency to prepare for management. However, the old landowners residing near the new fields, holding the old deeds of the collapsed sea fields, claimed that the newly formed sandy fields were originally civilian fields that had collapsed into the sea. For decades, taxes have been paid according to regulations, and there are seals that can be verified. Therefore, the property rights of the fields cannot be extinguished. The two sides fiercely disputed for more than a year, and presented petitions to the provincial and central government, but there were no concrete results. During the summer and autumn of this year, the two sides had a fight, resulting in a bloody incident and a lawsuit in court. It is learned that the county government has received an order from the province to abolish all the new seed households who paid for land reclamation during the fall, and the money they paid will be refunded. In the midst of the calls for improving the land system, an important case may be quickly concluded.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Community Representatives Visit National Army Soldiers and Refugees; To Go to Nantong on the 15th</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nantong News] A group of 40 people, including Wang Xiaolai and other representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Training Corps, are scheduled to visit Nantong on the 15th of this month to visit the National Army soldiers and refugees in northern Jiangsu and present flags and pay respects to Commander Li Moan.

<h3>Funds for Repairing the Qiantang Seawall Should Be Included in the National Budget; Zhejiang Province Cannot Afford It Due to Declining People's Livelihood; Two Department Directors Invite Relevant Central Government Officials to Discuss</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Zhejiang Civil Affairs Director Ruan Yicheng and Construction Director Pi Zuoqiong will invite relevant central government officials, as well as senior representatives from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai attending the National Assembly, to discuss the repair of the Qiantang Seawall tonight. It is reported that the central government approved 6 billion yuan for the Zhejiang Seawall project for the second half of this year, of which 2.1 billion yuan will be allocated by the central government, 2 billion yuan in relief materials will be allocated by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the remaining 2 billion yuan will be borne by the people of Zhejiang Province. However, after the war in Zhejiang, the people's livelihood has declined and it is difficult to afford the amount. It is proposed that the central government allocate the funds together. It is also proposed that the required 11 billion yuan for next year be included in the national budget, because the Qiantang Seawall concerns the people's livelihood in both Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, as well as Shanghai, and is not just a water conservancy project within one province. Moreover, the state has allocated public funds for seawall repairs in previous dynasties, and the people have never been charged with the burden of labor in addition to bearing the cost. Ruan and others also said that they hope to change the Seawall Engineering Bureau into a direct subordinate of the central government in order to increase efficiency and actively carry out the project.</p>
<h3>Gang of Robbers Apprehended for Consecutive Robberies of Cars, Boats</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Regular Hot News] The criminal police squad here has successively apprehended four persistent robbers, Zhou Xing, Gao Heshang, and Chen Heting, etc., disguised in Mochengdong Shizhuang and Wuxianba, who were involved in major robberies on land and water routes. They also seized one fast machine gun and one box cannon. During the interrogation, they confessed to repeatedly ambushing passenger vehicles on the Su-Chang routes with their accomplice A Bing (who has been executed). In August, September, and October, they robbed passenger boats such as Xiyi Ban, Shatou Ban, Beiguo Ban, Kun Chang Ban, Chengqin Ban, and Suchang Ban in Hudang and other places. They also confessed to consecutively robbing three Dahua shipping boats outside Ximen Mountain in a single day.

<h3>Frequent Sightings of Bandits in Pinghu; Joint Defense Initiated in Four Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Pinghu News] Following the changing climate, two alerts for winter defense have occurred in this county in the past two days: (1) A kidnapping case occurred in Baziqiao, a place bordering Yunhe and Jinshan County. The bandits all acted late at night, and the hostage was hidden in Zhouye Temple in Xinzhi Township of the county. Later, the hostage escaped from the bandit's lair by pushing down a wall at night and reported to the Zhangyan Factory Office. When the team of officers went to search, the bandits had already fled far away. (2) Near Dachuncun Bridge in Shida Township of the county, a group of armed men wearing military uniforms of unknown units were spotted, carrying two machine guns. The next day, these soldiers suddenly took off their military uniforms, changed into plain clothes, and acted mysteriously, heading towards Jinshan County. After receiving the report, the Criminal Police Squad of the Police Bureau, fearing other developments, reported to the authorities for verification. The county government, to ensure winter security in remote rural areas, has reportedly started a joint defense involving the security authorities of the neighboring counties of Ping, Jia, Jin, and Song.</p>
<h3>Anti-Bandit Campaign in Zhejiang Province Largely Completed; Over a Thousand Bandits Captured; Enhanced Security for Transportation During Winter Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 11th] According to Deputy Commander Deng Mingqing of the Zhejiang Security Command, the total number of bandits captured in the anti-bandit campaign in Zhejiang Province is 1,053, with 198 surrendering, 251 killed or wounded, and 76 short guns, two light machine guns, three hand-held machine guns, and over 2,000 rounds of ammunition seized. Except for the borders of Su, Zhe, Wan, Min, and the coastal areas, there are no bandit gangs of more than ten people in areas such as Siming Mountain, Kuaiji Mountain, Jiao Jiang, and Yongle. However, bandits are like grass, reappearing as soon as they are eliminated. The practice of bandits dispersing and living among the people has not been eradicated. It is estimated that there are still over a thousand people, and the large number of unemployed and social unrest are the main reasons. Only 269 scattered soldiers and vagrants have been taken in, and the work is insufficient, so orders have been issued to step up efforts. During the winter defense period, transportation will be strengthened, with armed village police forces organizing themselves in villages within 20 li on both sides of the highways to protect the roads in sections and provide patrols. Mobile police will be provided by the national army, and it is planned to use warning balloons to report bandit activities and strengthen communication. The registration of civilian guns in the province has exceeded 70,000, and the number of police personnel has reached over 25,000. With the combined efforts of the police and the people, there is nothing to fear in winter defense.</p>

<h3>Commercial Slump, New Taxes Increase; Wuxi Business Community Pleads for Tax Postponement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi News] The trade associations of this county, including those for new medicines, Chinese medicines, silk fabrics, printing, jewelry, grain, and department stores, believe that the current commercial slump is a widespread phenomenon, and the various expenses are too numerous to list, making it difficult to maintain operations and leading to a precarious situation. As a result, business closures have occurred one after another. Recently, the tax bureau has introduced regulations for the collection of interest income tax, rental income tax, salary income tax, and other items. Businesses are unable to bear the burden and are pleading for relief. Moreover, the interest income tax is mostly due to businesses having to borrow money from various households on a temporary basis in order to cope with emergencies. As for the interest payable, it has already been paid. If the tax is pursued from various households again, it is practically impossible. In addition to the various businesses having to compensate, there is no other proper solution. Furthermore, the rental income tax and the current house tax seem to be redundant. This time, the rental income tax is levied on an annual basis rather than a monthly basis, which is extremely high. How can merchants bear this loss? Moreover, the salaries of shop assistants in various businesses are very low, far less than the wages of workers. If income tax is deducted, it will also be difficult for them to make ends meet. Yesterday, the above situation was jointly communicated to the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the authorities, requesting them to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and approve a temporary postponement of the collection of various new taxes to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>

<h3>A Police Officer Submits a Letter Expressing Grievances</h3>
<p>First Letter We are all police officers standing in front of or downstairs of Guang Shengmen. Our families are suffering from the meager salaries we receive, suffering from cold and illness... And what about us? Bravely running in the cold wind and rain, on the icy and snowy ground, under the scorching sun, patiently standing at our posts, what is it for? When there is a fire, when there are bandits, we risk our lives to fight, arrest... what is it for? A few conspirators want to create a tragedy by using this hawker incident. We use our lives to protect the interests of the people, what is it for?</p>
<p>We certainly do not dare to claim credit, saying that we have fulfilled our responsibilities, but we let our families suffer and complain, and we ourselves endure and struggle, precisely because we want to take on a part of the national responsibility to protect the peace and tranquility of the society and the locality. So although it is a bit bitter, we feel a little comforted in spirit.</p>
<p>But some people say: "The police should serve the people and should not have the mentality of managing the people." Is this not serving the people but managing the people? Should we serve the bad elements or a few people, and let them disturb or hinder the interests or tranquility of the majority?</p>
<p>We shed blood for the interests of the majority... I ask, who sympathizes with us who are burnt out? Not only is there no sympathy or comfort, but we are also subjected to slander from some people due to misunderstanding?</p>
<p>Gentlemen! Try to put yourself in our shoes and think about how angry we will be, how difficult it will be to bear. So we want to appeal, we want to cry out, because we have been wronged? Because we have suffered unreasonable criticism, appeal, cry out, and ask the wise gentlemen to give us a little fair comfort! (A chief policeman representative from the Gaoqiao Police Station)</p>
<p>Second Letter I am a police officer and a loyal reader who reads your newspaper every day. In the November issue, your newspaper published the good news of a salary increase for civil servants and teachers, tripling the original salary. Now I still only receive 101,500 yuan per month. Fair gentlemen; not only have we not received a salary increase, but the five dou of yellow coarse rice (for October and November) that should be issued to us every month has not yet been issued. With prices rising, how can a salary of 100,000 yuan allow the police to maintain a living? Furthermore, civil servants are provided with military blankets, but we have not only not been provided with them but have also received no information at all. I wonder what the authorities are planning? The provision of goods at discounted prices sounds good, but each set costs 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. Please think about it, fair gentlemen, if we were to buy a set, we would have to go without food for at least a month, and we still wouldn't have enough. If there really are cheap goods available, where would we get the extra money to buy them? The police are the public servants of the people, protecting the people's lives and property, allowing them to live and work in peace. But with our current lives, fair gentlemen; give the police some sympathy! (Li Yaoxiang)</p>
<h3>Civil Servants Should Receive Preferential Treatment on Transportation</h3>
<p>In September of this year, the City Council and the free travel for civil servants and teachers case have not been implemented to this day. It is well known that the treatment of civil servants and teachers is meager and does not need to be repeated. Every day, they rely on one or two shuttle buses, limited by time and route. It is absolutely difficult to pick up and drop off all the civil servants scattered everywhere. Therefore, the number of people who can enjoy riding these shuttle buses is extremely small. The majority take trams or buses themselves. With the high cost of tickets today, this problem is serious for every civil servant. Fortunately, British and French tram companies have preferential measures for civil servants and teachers, selling monthly tickets for 10,000 yuan each, which greatly benefits the poor civil servants and teachers. However, in places where tram routes cannot reach, it is necessary to take the Public Utility Bureau's buses. Since the buses are operated by the city, they should be even more preferential, but the reality is completely the opposite. When civil servants of the City Government and its affiliated bureaus take the bus, they must buy tickets in accordance with the regulations, without any reduction. For employees of foreign tram companies in the same industry, there is no need to buy tickets under reciprocal conditions. Civil servants should absolutely abide by the law, and of course they must buy tickets when taking the bus. However, with prices rising and a monthly income of only more than 100,000 yuan, with the responsibility of supporting the family on their shoulders, the cost of transportation accounts for nearly one-third of the total income. How can they afford it? The organization and nature of buses and foreign tram companies are very different. They should do everything possible to seek benefits for civil servants and teachers. We no longer dream of the implementation of free travel for the Council. We only ask the Public Utility Bureau to quickly order the bus company, starting from January, to follow the example of tram companies and sell monthly tickets for civil servants and teachers to take the bus, and we will be very grateful! (A Small Civil Servant)</p>

<h3>British Ship Strikes Mine in Corfu Strait; Britain Sends Ultimatum to Albania; Demanding Apology and Guarantee that Similar Incidents Will Not Occur Again; If No Satisfactory Reply Within Two Weeks, Complaint Will Be Filed with the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] It was announced here tonight: The British government, regarding the loss of life and property caused by the unprovoked attack on British ships in the Corfu Strait, has sent a strongly worded ultimatum to the Albanian government, demanding a formal apology to Britain within fourteen days and requesting compensation for the damage. If a satisfactory reply is not received, the British government will submit the matter to the Security Council. The first incident occurred on May 15, when the British cruisers "Orion" and "Superb" were fired upon by Albanian coastal batteries while passing through the Strait, but fortunately were not damaged. Then, on October 22, the British destroyers "Saumarez" and "Volage" were seriously damaged after hitting underwater mines in the Strait, resulting in the deaths of as many as 44 officers and soldiers. In between the two incidents, merchant ships passing through the area were also frequently fired upon. The British government's note pointed out that British minesweepers swept mines in the area in November and discovered that these mines had been laid shortly before the British destroyers were attacked. From the perspective of Albania's strict coastal defense, if mines were laid in the Strait, the Albanian authorities would definitely know about it. Therefore, the British government believes that these mines were either laid by Albania itself, or the Albanian government must have known about the laying of the mines. Therefore, the Albanian government has seriously violated international law. The British government hereby demands that the Albanian government formally apologize to the British government for the attacks on British ships and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. The British government also demands that the Albanian government compensate for the losses suffered by the British ships on October 22 and pay full compensation to the families of the 44 officers and soldiers who died. If the Albanian government does not provide a satisfactory reply within fourteen days from the date of delivery of the note, the British government will regard Albania's actions as a serious threat to international peace and security and will file a complaint with the Security Council. The note was delivered to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade yesterday.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, New York, 10th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has reached an agreement on all issues relating to the legal status of the Free Port of Trieste, except for one issue that has not been agreed upon, which has been decided to be postponed for discussion. According to experts who attended the Foreign Ministers Conference and participated in drafting the Trieste plan, if the economies of the countries behind Trieste, such as Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, can be revived and achieve a certain degree of balance, this step may enable the area to be self-sufficient in a few years. The political system of Trieste can be summarized as follows: (1) The Port of Trieste will be opened as a free port, jointly governed internationally, but without political power and with an autonomous nature. (2) The free port will be governed by a governor, but the governor must be nominated by the Trieste government committee and appointed by the chief executive of the area. (3) An international committee will be established, under the direction of the governor, consisting of one representative from Trieste, one representative each from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. The chairman will be the representative from Trieste.</p>

He urged the Soviet Union not to follow a policy of isolation, which breeds suspicion. Shaw also claimed that Molotov was opposing his own proposal. When the Political Committee passed the armed forces investigation case by a vote of 34 to 7, the Soviet Union expressed its dissent, stating that the issue of investigating domestic troop numbers was only related to the general disarmament case. Earlier, US representative Connally also stated, "We have no secrets. We should make all our military strength public to the world, and we hope other countries can do the same." However, Connally reiterated his opposition to the British proposal to have the Security Council send an investigative team to review troop deployment reports on the ground.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly today continued to discuss the issue of investigating national armed forces. The Soviet representative agreed that an international organization should be responsible for investigating national armed forces, but insisted that investigations of national armaments, including atomic bombs, must occur simultaneously, thus merging the investigation of armed forces and armaments into one case. The British representative has "in principle" already approved the method proposed by the Soviet Union. If this proposal is passed by the General Assembly, the United States will inevitably have to disclose its atomic bomb secrets. The main point of contention at present remains the issue of veto power. The British representative insists that the international organization responsible for investigating national armed forces and armaments should not be subject to the veto power in the Security Council, while the Soviet representative argues the opposite. General Assembly President Spaak declared that if this proposal is passed by the General Assembly, the entire organization for investigating national armed forces and armaments could be established by January 15th of next year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 10th] The drafting subcommittee of the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to hold its final meeting tomorrow to draft a report to be submitted to the Political and Security Committee. If passed, it will then be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. However, according to well-informed sources, an agreement has been reached on all the key points to be included in the draft resolution, including: (1) accelerating the work of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission; (2) the Security Council should promptly review the reports submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission; (3) recognizing the necessity of limiting and reducing national armaments and armed forces; (4) drafting several agreements to prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (5) establishing an international control organization under the jurisdiction of the Security Council, with its powers and duties also defined by the Security Council in a military agreement, subject to the approval of all members of the United Nations; (6) members of the United Nations should promptly provide the necessary troops to the Security Council for command in order to form an international army; (7) members of the United Nations stationed within the borders of former enemy countries should gradually withdraw their troops in progressive and proportional percentages; (8) members of the United Nations stationed within the borders of non-enemy countries should withdraw their troops unless they have obtained the consent of the latter's government; (9) universally reducing armed forces of all countries. Regarding the last point, the subcommittee held lengthy discussions because it not only stipulated that domestic armed forces should be reduced, but also that the troops gradually withdrawn by member states from other countries should also be reduced. Finally, the British representative proposed an amendment requesting that each United Nations member state provide precise reports on its armaments and military strength, which was approved by the subcommittee.</p>
<h3>Agreement Draft between the United Nations and the Universal Postal Union Under Discussion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 11th Dispatch] Experts from thirty-eight countries held a meeting here today to study the draft agreement between the Universal Postal Union and the United Nations, which was drafted by the United Nations Secretariat. During today's meeting, many speakers considered several parts of the draft to be quite commendable. British expert Wheatman stated that a valuable contribution that the Universal Postal Union could make, and one that could assist the United Nations in maintaining world peace, is to deprive aggressors of the ability to exchange postal items with other countries.</p>

<h3>Iranian Government Forces Penetrate Deep into Azerbaijan Province, Capture the Important City of Mianeh, Britain Reaffirms Non-Interference in Iranian Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 11th] According to government troops who have entered Azerbaijan Province to monitor the elections, Mianeh has been occupied. Mianeh is located southwest of Tabriz, the provincial capital, and 200 kilometers from Tabriz. A dispatch from the Azerbaijan front lines claimed that the news of the government troops occupying Mianeh after fierce battles with the Azerbaijan Democratic Forces could be considered confirmed. If the city has been occupied, it means that government forces have advanced 30 miles. The dispatch also claimed that the Soviet ambassador to Iran, Sakchikov, lodged a strong protest with Prime Minister Sultaneh against the Iranian government's military action, alleging that the Iranian government had broken its promise by sending troops into Azerbaijan Province, which could threaten the Soviet border. It is claimed that the Iranian Prime Minister is under constant pressure from the Soviets to stop military action. Parliamentary elections have now begun in other parts of Iran, but elections in Azerbaijan Province will be held only after government forces are able to control the voting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesman reiterated previous statements, declaring that the movement of Iranian troops within their own country is purely an internal affair of the Iranian government. The spokesman denied rumors that the dispatch of troops to Azerbaijan Province by the Iranian central government was at the suggestion of the British side. When reporters asked whether the British government would still consider it an internal affair if war broke out in Azerbaijan Province, the answer was that the British government certainly believes that the unrest within Iran should be resolved by the Iranian government.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expresses Concern</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] London, 11th Broadcast: Soviet newspapers today expressed concern about the civil war in Iran, and stated that the United States had assisted the Iranian government troops in their offensive with 404 bombers.</p>
<h3>Atomic Power Plant</h3>
<p>To Appear in Chicago in Two Years</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, 10th] Professor Pooleton, an American scientist who participated in the creation of the atomic bomb, recently stated here that the first power plant utilizing atomic energy is expected to begin supplying electricity within two years. As for the entire city of Chicago being supplied with electricity generated by atomic energy, it will be ten years later.</p>
<h3>Difficulties Abound for New Egyptian Cabinet, Minister of Social Affairs Refuses to Take Office, Security in Cairo is Unstable and Tense, Prospects for British-Egyptian Negotiations Are Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 10th] In response to the recent bombings and arson incidents in this city, authorities today ordered the police to shoot and kill any suspicious individuals loitering in public places, in front of the residences of ministers and senior officials, without exception. In addition, it was learned that the new cabinet organized under the leadership of Prime Minister Nokrashy was unable to be sworn in before King Farouk today because the newly appointed Minister of Social Affairs, Yaruba, firmly refused to accept the position. According to Yaruba, "No one consulted my opinion, so I cannot accept it. I often refused to sign agreements with Britain in the previous cabinet, and I still insist on this view."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Responsible political observers claim that based on the inaugural address of Egypt's new Prime Minister Nokrashy, the differences between Britain and Egypt regarding the future status of Sudan will continue to exist. Nokrashy stated that his cabinet will lead the Sudanese people to establish an autonomous government, and will forever be united with Egypt under the Egyptian king. Individuals here believe this is a formal interpretation of the Sudan section of the Bevin-Sidky draft agreement. However, the concept of not allowing the Sudanese people to have independence and making them permanently merge with Egypt has been rejected successively by the Governor-General of Sudan, Huddleston, and the London Foreign Office. Since the British government has no tendency to abandon its position, it is expected that the Bevin-Sidky agreement will be difficult to serve as the basis for British-Egyptian treaty revision negotiations.</p>
<h3>Forcibly Kissing Vivien Leigh, Sentenced to Two Months in Prison</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] A 28-year-old university graduate, Vincent, attempted to forcibly kiss the famous actress Vivien Leigh when she and her husband Laurence Olivier got out of their car, and also assaulted Olivier and two police officers nearby. After being arrested and prosecuted, he was sentenced to two months imprisonment for each of the three assault charges, to be served concurrently. Vincent claimed in court that he had originally secured a role with the Old Vic Company, but was suddenly dismissed, suspecting that Laurence Olivier had deliberately made things difficult for him.</p>
<h3>Churchill Demands Debate on Indian Issue</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Says Now Is Not the Time</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] London, 11th Broadcast: A fierce debate broke out in the British House of Commons today on the Indian issue. Lawrenson first delivered a speech, stating that negotiations are currently underway and it is not appropriate to begin debating this issue. Eden then delivered a speech, expressing the same sentiment. Finally, opposition leader Churchill delivered a speech, strongly advocating that the Indian issue should be debated immediately.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Impasse, Third Vote Postponed Again</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The National Assembly was originally scheduled to hold a third vote at 3:00 PM today to elect a Prime Minister, but consultations with leaders of various French parties failed to reach an agreement, so it has been decided to postpone the vote.</p>
<h3>US Denies Deciding to Reduce Plan to Seek Reparations from Japan, Japan to Announce Five-Year Economic Plan Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th Dispatch] US State Department personnel today denied external reports that the final plan for the amount of reparations the United States is demanding from Japan is less than what Pauley's proposal requested from Japanese industries. It is claimed that the reparations plan is still in the preparatory stage, and there is no final decision yet. Whether it will be more or less than the Pauley plan is still unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] According to Japanese sources, the scheduled report in Japan regarding Pauley's proposed Japanese reparations plan has been postponed indefinitely in order to avoid causing international repercussions. It is claimed that the Japanese government is afraid that this would make other countries think that Japan is planning to ask for a reduction in the terms of reparations just as the announcement is about to be made.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese government is about to announce a five-year economic construction plan for the years 1945 to 1950. This plan will rely heavily on the production of coal and hydroelectric power, stipulating that 35 million tons of coal will be produced in 1950, which is equivalent to 80% of the 1937 level. Japanese leaders deeply believe that Japan's future lies in industry and foreign trade, not in democracy. The major issue at present is the reparations plan. Pauley's reparations plan gives a clear concept of Japan's economic future.</p>
<h3>Bilbo Awarded the US Gold Palm Medal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th United Press] Former Italian Prime Minister Nobile was awarded the Medal with Gold Palm Fronds by US Secretary of the Army Patterson for his meritorious anti-Japanese movement.</p>
<h3>US Fleet Commander Discusses Future Warfare, Arctic Is Important But Coast Should Also Be Emphasized</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] Vice Admiral Barbey, a Pacific landing warfare expert and commander of the Fourth Fleet, today discussed future warfare trends. According to him, if the United States is attacked by weapons of mass destruction in the future, 5 million people may be killed or injured within a few hours. But the enemy cannot defeat us all at once. Within hours, our country will implement large-scale retaliatory attacks. The United States is at least ten years ahead of other countries in the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, but we must buy them unceasingly. Military progress is the most powerful guarantee behind the success of the United Nations. If war breaks out again one day, it will never be a gentleman's duel, but a matter of the survival of the civilized masses. In general, people emphasize attacks coming across the Arctic. I do not know the reason for this. I believe that it is more possible for foreign countries to send more than a dozen submarines and atomic bombs from locations scattered hundreds of miles away in the Atlantic Ocean to various cities on the east coast of the United States. Rocket-style atomic bombs can even be launched after the submarine sinks, but our retaliation will also be swift. The enemy cannot avoid it and will suffer even greater losses.</p>
<h3>China and India (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— (Written by Nehru)</p>
<p>Translated by Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India</p>
<p>Xuanzang tells us a lot about the situation at Nalanda University, and other records are similar. A few years ago, I visited Nalanda University and was amazed to see many relics that had been systematically excavated from the ruins. Today, only a small portion has been excavated, and the rest is still inhabited by people, but these places still include vast gardens surrounded by solemn houses made of stone.</p>
<p>Shortly after Xuanzang passed away in China, another traveler, the monk Yijing, came to India. He set out from China in 671 AD and traveled for a full two years before reaching the port of Tamralipta in India, which is at the mouth of the Hooghly River. Because he came by sea, he stopped in Palembang (in Sumatra) and studied some months of Chuo Wen. This sea voyage was of great significance, perhaps due to changes in the political situation that made Central Asia unstable, making it impossible to come by land. Several Buddhist monasteries along the way were places for them to stop and rest. Sea routes may also be more suitable for the growth of Indian colonies in Indonesia and for establishing regular commercial relations between India and other countries. Records from Yijing and others show that at this time, there was regular navigation between Iran, India, Malaya, Sumatra, and China. Yijing first traveled from Guangdong to Sumatra by Persian ship.</p>
<p>Yijing also studied at Nalanda University for a long time and brought back thousands of Sanskrit classics. His main interest was in the key points of Buddhist rituals and rules, and he recorded these things in great detail. He also told us a lot about clothing, food, and customs. The main food in North India was wheat, as it is now, and in East India, rice was the main food. Meat was sometimes eaten, but it was rare. Ghee, milk, and other things could be seen everywhere, and there were many biscuits and fruits. Yijing recorded something extremely important for Indians, which is the reliance on the purity of a specific religious ritual. "Now the first and most important distinction between the five Indias and other countries is the sincerity of religious rituals. Moreover: 'Leftover food, which can be stored in China, may not conform to Indian regulations'."</p>
<p>Yijing once talked about India, saying that it is the West, but he himself tells us that India is called Aryadesha. The meaning of Arya is "struggle", and the meaning of Desha is "land", so it is the "land of struggle", all for the West. It is so named because the character of its people is noble and pure, and all the people praise this land with this name. India is also called "Central Land" (Madhyadesha) because it is located in the center of all the countries. All people feel close to this name. The northern barbarians (such as the Huns, Mongols, Turks) only call it Jingtǔ as India, but this is not a common word after all. This is just a local name and has no special meaning. The people of India do not know this name, and the most appropriate name for India is "Pure Land."</p>
<p>Yijing's discussion of Shendu is very interesting. He once said: "Some people say that the meaning of India (Indu) is the moon, and the Chinese call India as Yindu, which comes from this. Although its meaning may be like this, this is not a common name. Likewise, when Indians call China as Zhina, it's just a name and has no special meaning." He also mentioned the names used for Korea and other countries in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Yijing has the utmost respect for India, and the same goes for Indian things. He described these things in detail and gave them to his motherland—China—first. India may be the "Pure Land," but China is the "Divine Land." "The people of the Five Indias are quite proud of their sincerity and nobility. But the reverence for thought, literacy, dignified demeanor, moderate attitude, welcoming etiquette, the deliciousness of food and soup, and the kind and just heart can only be obtained in China, not in other countries." The healing skills of acupuncture and the ingenuity of pulse detection cannot be replaced by any place in India, and the medicines that prolong life can only be seen in China... In terms of human character and the quality of things, China is named the Divine Land. Which of the Five Indias does not respect China?"</p>
<p>The ancient Sanskrit term for the Chinese emperor is Deva-Putra, which is accurately translated as the "Son of Heaven."</p>
<p>Yijing himself was a Sanskrit scholar. He praised Sanskrit and said that this language is also revered in the distant countries of the north and south. There are also several people from Shenzhou (China) and Heaven (India) who teach the rules of this language. Sanskrit scholars in China must have been extremely common. We find it interesting that several Chinese scholars wanted to use Sanskrit phonetic symbols in the Chinese language. One of the best examples is the monk Shouwen of the Tang Dynasty in China, who wanted to make the Chinese language an alphabetic phonetic language in this direction. The influence of Indian Buddhism is subtle. Although there are often pilgrims from China who come to visit the Buddhist holy sites in India, the actual academic exchanges between the two countries have been cut off. When the political revolution took place in the 11th century AD, all the Buddhist monks took the classics and went to Nepal or crossed the Himalayas to Tibet. We already knew that important parts of ancient Indian writings had reached China and Tibet, and in recent years, the original texts have been completely discovered there, and there are quite a few translations. Many ancient Indian classics, not only those about Buddhism, but also those about Brahmanism, astronomy, mathematics, and medicine, are still preserved in Chinese and Tibetan. Regarding these academic connections, the best example that still exists today is the Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese dictionary of Buddhist terms. This book was written in the 9th or 10th century AD, and is called the Great Dictionary (Mahavyutpatti).</p>

<h3>Lu Jingshi Convenes Representatives of Textile Workers to Discuss the Issue of Annual Bonus Distribution, Labor Expresses Concessions, Hoping to Still Follow the Methods of Previous Years, The Social Affairs Bureau Will Convene Business Leaders to Hold Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, yesterday afternoon convened representatives of cotton textile workers at the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau to exchange views on the issue of annual bonuses. Director Lu told reporters: the labor side believes that the profits of the cotton textile industry are very high, and hopes to have an annual bonus of six months' salary; but the business side believes that yarn prices have been restricted, and profits are limited. Although the books show money, if calculated in terms of materials, it has not increased, and it cannot accept the labor side's request. After his persuasion, the labor side is willing to make considerable concessions, but the minimum hope is to follow the methods of previous years, dividing the annual bonus of workers into 20%, 25%, and 33% of the total annual income, with workers getting 20% and management personnel getting 30%. The so-called total annual income refers to the actual income after deducting holidays. He believes that the labor and management sides of the cotton textile industry will definitely be able to work together harmoniously, and reach an agreement on this issue under the principles of maintaining production and protecting labor. In addition, according to labor representatives, yesterday's meeting was an informal exchange of views, and the labor side has put forward its views as much as possible for reference. Lu will return to Nanjing tomorrow and will come to Shanghai again on the 21st of this month, at which time there should be a concrete decision on the annual bonus issue for the cotton textile industry.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has scheduled a talk with the standing directors of the city's General Labor Union, Industry Association, and Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on Friday, the 13th of this month. Notices have already been issued, and it is hoped that they will all attend at that time.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Relief for the Unemployed Postponed to Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Social Affairs Bureau originally scheduled a meeting yesterday to discuss a plan for providing relief to unemployed workers, but it was temporarily unable to be held due to unforeseen circumstances and was decided to be postponed to next Monday. According to Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Bureau, the workers' hostel was originally scheduled to accommodate more than 1,000 workers, but the current actual number of residents is over 1,800. Due to overcrowding, environmental hygiene has been greatly affected, resulting in more than a dozen worker children dying of smallpox in November. At the meeting next week, discussions will be held on how to improve the hostel's medical and health facilities, and the issue of raising this funding. As for the placement of unemployed workers, Li believes that the palliative measures are to enable factories that have already started work to maintain production, and to enable those that have not started work to resume work as soon as possible. The fundamental solution is to improve the entire national economy in order to increase employment opportunities.</p>
<h3>Patrolling and Inspecting the Restricted Construction Zone; Kindly Advising the Removal of Makeshift Sheds; More Than 100 Mu of Vacant Land in Five Locations to Be Leased to Slum Dwellers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the makeshift sheds being built within the city's restricted construction zone, the Municipal Government, after a resolution at the municipal meeting to prohibit them, the Bureau of Public Works, upon order, began patrolling and enforcing regulations yesterday in conjunction with the Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9:00 AM, the two bureaus specially formed a mobile patrol team, led by Song Xueqin, Section Chief of the Demolition Section of the Bureau of Public Works, and Lu Xia, Section Chief of the Traffic Section of the Police Bureau, leading six police officers and six craftsmen each, set out on patrol. Before the patrol personnel departed, they were specially summoned for instruction by Zhao Shekang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, who instructed all personnel to advise the residents of the makeshift sheds to dismantle them with a sincere and kind attitude, and to inform them of the reasons for the demolition, the relationship to the interests of the public, and the resettlement arrangements, so as to provide a way out for the residents. The patrol team inspected Changning Road and Kaixuan Road in the morning and went to Yangshupu and the Suzhou River area in the afternoon. There were more structures built in the Yangshupu area, while the situation on the other roads was better. When the patrol personnel saw a small number of slum dwellers building houses, they explained the demolition matter to them. The slum dwellers' attitude was very good, and they all agreed to dismantle them within two or three days. The craftsmen and police officers accompanying them did not order immediate demolition yesterday but gave warnings that if they were not dismantled within the time limit, they would be demolished on their behalf.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhao, the Director of the Bureau of Public Works, personally visited Changshou Road, Xikang Road, Yuyao Road, Yichang Road, and Jiangning Road yesterday morning together with Wang Yuankang, the Director of the Construction Department of the Bureau. The site with the most houses built was Yuyao Road (formerly Singapore Road), and most of the central district's shacks were built within the roads or alleys. Director Zhao will still personally inspect the Yangshupu area today. Yesterday, our reporter paid a special visit to Director Zhao, asking him about the methods for dealing with the slum dwellers, and he informed us that the makeshift sheds within the restricted construction zone that have not yet been completed will definitely be demolished, and they will now be directed to build in non-restricted construction zones. At the same time, according to urban planning, the municipal government has approved and instructed the Land Administration Bureau to slightly purchase five private land locations totaling one hundred and sixty-three mu to build civilian villages, including: 21 mu on Feihong Road in Yangshupu, 45 mu in Caojiadu in the Pusong District, 40.8 mu on Tianyaoqiao in the Hunan District, 15.6 mu in Yangjiabo in Pudong, and 40.8 mu on Zhaoju Road in the Hunan District. The land was originally intended to be included in next year's budget for the construction of civilian villages. However, before the funds are available, the vacant land can be leased to slum dwellers for site selection.</p>
<p>More than one hundred buildings in the civilian village built by the Bureau in Damuqiao, Nanshi, are now rented by a small number of citizens, and the rest are used by municipal government employees. Director Zhao also stated that housing construction must be zoned to match urban planning. If dormitories can be built near factories, the housing shortage problem can be alleviated somewhat. Residential and commercial areas are also often divided. Director Zhao also inspected the bottleneck-shaped protruding houses in the city yesterday, and this issue will be submitted for public discussion at the next municipal meeting.</p>

<h3>Road Repair Work Actively Underway</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the city's road repair project, yesterday, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, told reporters that the main road construction project in the city has been completed, totaling one hundred and twenty thousand square meters. The construction of branch roads is also actively underway.

Those that have been completed include Fansi Du Road, Linsen Middle Road, and Fuxing Middle Road; those about to start construction include Yunnan Road, Shandong Road, Guangxi Road, Qiujiang Road, Xizang North Road, and Zha Pu Road. It is claimed that if the road repair funds allocated by the municipal government next year are sufficient, then from April to December next spring, the roads in the central urban area, including the British and French concession areas, can all be repaired. As for the city's roads, including the suburbs, it is hoped that they can also be repaired within two years.</p>
<h3>Launching Winter Relief Funds; Speaker Pan Takes the Lead; The Municipal Council Begins Soliciting Donations</h3>
<p>Recently, the cold air has hit Shanghai, and yesterday there was wind and rain all day long. Poor people suffering from cold and hunger are dying every day. Although the municipal government has been actively raising funds, it is still limited and unable to benefit all the poor people. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Municipal Council, in view of this, believes that it is necessary to mobilize all Shanghai citizens to assist in order to be effective. Yesterday, he specially sent a letter to the Council ordering them to assist the government in actively launching winter relief efforts in order to achieve the main purpose of serving the people. Speaker Pan himself took the lead in donating all of the Council's transportation expenses of more than 500,000 yuan. It is learned that the Council has already complied and plans to start soliciting donations from today, hoping that all legal entities will work together to support this righteous cause.</p>
<h3>Meng Jiangnu Performance Successful; Madame Chiang Hosts Tea Party for Sponsors; Mei Lanfang Critiques Acting; Fei Xi Praises the Plot</h3>
<p>Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling hosted a tea party at the Second Reception Hall of the Lizi Society at 5:00 PM yesterday to raise funds for the reconstruction of the maternal school for the veterans of the National Revolutionary Army, inviting the Shanghai sponsors of the Meng Jiangnu opera performance. Foreign guests Fei Xi and Mayor Wu's couple, Fang Zhi, Xu Jiqing, Wu Shaodui, Xuan Tiewu, Huang Renlin, Wei Jingmeng, Xi Yushu, Ding Guitang, Liu Gongyun, Xu Xueyu, Cao Jun, Mei Lanfang, Wang Bosheng, Deng Shiping, Guo Linshuang Liu Jingji, Zhang Rongchu, Shen Dexie, Wang Zhaohuai, Zhang Chu and more than 20 others attended. Despite the torrential rain, Madame arrived on time and shook hands and greeted the guests one by one, with a very happy mood. After the guests and hosts had some refreshments, Madame first consulted Dr. Mei Lanfang and Wang Bosheng, the president of the National Drama School, separately for their criticisms of the content of the Meng Jiangnu opera. They believed that in addition to the need for slight improvements in performance skills, the plot was deeply meaningful and could express a part of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Then, General Secretary Huang Renlin reported briefly, saying that he was very grateful for the enthusiastic fundraising from all walks of life for the Shanghai performance of the Meng Jiangnu opera. Judging from the situation of the continuous performances, the total income may reach 400 million. Among the sponsors, especially Mr. Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Xu Jikang provided the most assistance. Mr. Mei Lanfang and Wang Bosheng provided the most guidance, so that such achievements could be obtained, which is really a rare opportunity. The evening show on the 10th was sold out, and it was originally scheduled to close on the evening of the 11th. In order to satisfy the audience's interest, a special performance was added on the 12th, and the ticket prices for the daytime show were reduced to 2,000 and 4,000, and the ticket prices for the evening show were reduced to 5,000 and 10,000, so that ordinary citizens can watch it. After Huang's report, Madame Chiang delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang then rose to give a speech, saying that the Meng Jiangnu opera has achieved great success in Shanghai. She not only represents the veterans' schools in expressing gratitude to everyone for raising educational funds for our veterans' children, but also feels that it is of profound significance to introduce Chinese culture to foreign countries and increase international understanding through the Meng Jiangnu opera, and she feels sincerely gratified. After the Meng Jiangnu opera was staged, she and Chairman Chiang watched the performance four times and felt that the content of the opera was much improved compared to ordinary old dramas. General Marshall was also interested in the opera and often talked about it, which proves that the opera can attract many audiences if it is performed abroad.</p>
<p>Sponsors' Opinions</p>
<p>Then, each of the sponsors stated their opinions on improving the opera, which can be summarized into the following points: (1) The music must match the movements, (2) The actress playing Meng Jiangnu is too old, (3) Gods and ghosts are mixed together, and the movements are messy, (4) The makeup should be improved to distinguish between good and evil. Finally, Madame asked the foreign guest Fei Xi for his opinion. He said that the plot was very good and hoped that it could be performed in Washington, New York and other places in the United States. Madame expressed her approval, and then General Secretary Huang made a concluding remark, saying that everyone's enthusiastic sponsorship has not only made a great contribution to cultural work, but also laid the foundation for the future of the veterans' schools, and he expressed his great gratitude to everyone. The guests and hosts talked happily until about 6:00 PM, and then dispersed in joy. After the meeting, Madame, accompanied by Huang Renlin, inspected the various venues in the reception hall for a week before taking a car back to her official residence on Dongping Road to rest. At 8:30 PM, Madame went to the Nanjing Grand Theater to watch the Meng Jiangnu performance again, with great interest, and returned at the end.</p>
<h3>The Person in Charge of the Troupe Said That the Number of People Will Be Reduced When Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Also, according to Deng Shiping, the general manager of the China Youth Music Troupe, the play was performed at the Lizi Society in Nanjing for nine days from November 6, and there were many audiences. The ticket prices were divided into two types: 10,000 and 50,000, and the income was more than 100 million yuan. It has been performed in Shanghai since December 5, and the ticket prices are divided into three types: 10,000, 20,000, and 50,000. The total income will be settled after the performance is over. The results are generally not bad. However, there are still many shortcomings in the plot content and performance skills, and he hopes that people from all walks of life will give more guidance and sponsorship. The troupe sincerely accepts and earnestly improves. When asked about the total number of actors, he said that there are 35 actors and about 60 people including transportation and other affairs. In the future, if performing abroad, they will still try their best to reduce the number.</p>
<h3>President Song Returns to Nanjing After Completing His Mission</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] President Song, after coming to Shanghai to negotiate with the banking, financial, industrial, and commercial sectors to finalize a production loan and a plan to eliminate the black market for cotton banknotes, returned to Nanjing by China Airlines plane with his secretary and adjutant yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Meeting Taixu in the Jade Buddha Temple; Abbot of Buddhist Sects Mournfully</h3>
<p>[Special feature from our newspaper] In the cold rain, with the sound of Buddhist chanting, the Jade Buddha Temple appears even more quiet and solemn.</p>
<p>Master Songyue led us through a corridor, and stopped in front of a quiet hall on the rear side of the Great Buddha Hall. He stepped forward and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"This is the old Dharma Master Taixu."</p>
<p>The old Dharma Master Taixu was wearing a robe of yellowish-brown, with the cuffs of his white flannel undershirt extending outside the cuffs of the robe. He was wearing a velvet hat, also dark brown. Behind his tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses were a pair of kind and joyful eyes, looking at us with a smile. He extended his plump and slender hand and shook ours happily. We sat down on the comfortable sofas. Master Songyue sat quietly on a chair beside us, listening.</p>
<p>Buddhism prohibits killing, and a large-scale war of mutual slaughter is about to take place, so naturally, we inevitably talked about the current situation. The old Dharma Master seemed to hesitate for a moment, and then slowly said, "Since the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the Kuomintang finally won the War of Resistance, and in fact, the whole country should be able to recuperate and stabilize. Who knew—the negotiations would fail to produce results, leading to this situation!"</p>
<p>The old Dharma Master lowered his head and could not help but nod.</p>
<p>Buddhist Party Formation</p>
<p>We changed the subject: "Recently, there has been a widespread rumor about the formation of a Buddhist party. What is the Grand Master's view?"</p>
<p>"I discussed this issue in the first issue of the Juequn Weekly. Zhongshan Xisheng said that political power belongs to all the people, and monks and nuns are also people, so they should be willing to ask about political affairs. We can participate in elections, to the Senate, the Provincial Council, or the National Assembly—but I don't advocate the formation of a party."</p>
<p>Dharma Master Taixu has always been very concerned about Buddhist education. In Chongqing, he presided over the Haizang Institute of Buddhist Studies, which played a very important role in the border areas.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tibetan Buddhism, I can't help but think of Esoteric Buddhism, because the various miracles of Living Buddha Nuona in Shanghai are really too strange. The Dharma Master said: Esoteric Buddhism is indeed a bit strange, but it is indeed Mahayana. Some strange things can be said to be "techniques," but what the Haizang Institute of Buddhist Studies studies are "doctrines," which are "learning."</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple Incident</p>
<p>After breakfast, we talked about the Jing'an Temple incident, which has attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Dharma Master Tai Lu scratched his head, which was already full of silver threads. He said firmly:</p>
<p>"I think this matter includes two parts. The first part is the matter of De Wu and Mi Jia being reported as traitors. Honestly speaking, it is not really enough to consider these two people as traitors. If anyone who participated in one or two people's organizations during the enemy's occupation is considered a traitor, I am afraid that there are four or five million people in the occupied areas who should be reported. The second part is the issue of how to manage Jing'an Temple and a little of its property. I think that the management system in temples in the past is no longer suitable for modern times. The Haizang Institute of Buddhist Studies that I established in Chongqing was originally a desolate temple. Because the management in the temple was poor, it was very damaged. Later, when the Institute of Buddhist Studies was established, a board of directors was established to manage the temple property, and a specialist was hired to be responsible for the affairs of the Institute, which achieved results. I think the property of Jing'an Temple can also be organized into a board of directors to manage it, and a hospital, library, or school can be run on the temple grounds, and another specialist can be hired to be responsible for managing administrative matters—it can be run as a business run by Buddhism. This is probably a more appropriate method."</p>
<p>On Monk Liugen</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple is currently managed by Liugen, but the Dharma Master clearly believes that the current method is not a fundamental solution. He said: "In the future, when De Wu and the others return, there will definitely be disputes. Liugen is a mediocre and incompetent person. He also presided over Jing'an Temple in the early years of the Republic of China, but he has never managed it well since he came. Lawsuits have never stopped. Therefore, the management method at the root must be improved."</p>
<p>The Dharma Master is already fifty-eight years old this year. In recent years, because of high blood pressure, he cannot write too many articles or say too much. He may be going to Ningbo soon. The National Buddhist Association meeting to be held in Nanjing next year will also be presided over by the Dharma Master.</p>
<p>When we left the Jade Buddha Temple, the twilight in the rain was already very dim.</p>

<h3>Representatives from All Regions Gather for a Week-Long Meeting; The Christian Conference Successfully Concludes Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 12th National Congress of the National Christian Council of China, which opened in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, successfully concluded yesterday after a week. Representatives attended from as far away as the nine northeastern provinces, a grand event unprecedented in more than ten years. Advanced churches from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada all sent representatives to participate, discussing how to coordinate plans and seek to send one hundred specially trained technical personnel to China next year to assist in all construction plans, including experts such as musicians, scientists, educators, and social workers. Many suggestions were very insightful. The Association also responded to the Chairman's announcement to engage in spiritual construction, specifically launching a national three-year movement of striving forward starting next year, concentrating all talents and resources to promote the success of the movement and improve the spiritual life of the people. Other suggestions included welcoming missionaries to China to assist in the work, intensifying talent training, improving the treatment of staff, and enriching advanced studies, strengthening cooperation in various tasks, paying attention to assisting the promotion of national education, developing work in border areas, and planning the publication of a Christian Daily News, and dozens of other cases. The Association also elected Liang Xiaoye as President, and Jiang Changchuan, Cui Xianxiang, Zhao Zizhen, Bao Zheqing, etc. as members before the closing ceremony. In addition to issuing a declaration, the Congress also sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to express respect.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply Has Improved; Sources Are Actively Being Dredged; 6,000 Tons of Annam White Coal Will Be Shipped</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Shanghai District: In order to prevent the black market for coal in the city, the method of allocating coal to factories has been improved this month, that is, in the past, the required amount for each factory per month was declared by the Coal Industry Association on behalf of its members. Now, it has been changed to factories directly submitting a list of their actual needs, which is then reviewed and allocated by the Association. On the one hand, it can cooperate with the needs of factories to speed up production, and on the other hand, it can avoid the Association from manipulating the process, so that the black market price will naturally tend to decline. In terms of white coal, it is estimated that 6,000 tons may be shipped from Annam on the 15th. According to reliable sources, a considerable amount has been negotiated with the Annam Gubao Coal Mine, and if there are no accidents, 6,000 tons can be shipped to China every month, and a batch can arrive by the end of the month. In terms of lump coal, there is a shortage of goods in various countries after the war, and merchants are freely purchasing many tons. The Association has previously negotiated the purchase of 10,000 tons from the United States, and if the crew strike there subsides, it can be shipped. The distribution method will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Relieving the Coal Shortage Depends on Opening Up New Sources</p>
<p>The person in charge continued: In order to solve the current difficulty in the raw materials for coal briquettes, in addition to ensuring the regular supply of raw materials, another 2,000 tons of small pieces of white coal will be added to the Coal Briquette Industry Association this month to supplement the raw materials. Regarding the elimination of the general black market problem, it is still hoped that the local government will do its best to assist. The person in charge finally said: Relieving the coal shortage depends on opening up new sources, the most important of which is the transportation problem. According to the arrival of goods from various places from March to September in the past, they were all ideal. The results in October and November were not good. Within the scope of ability, we will try our best to strengthen it. In addition to maintaining 145,000 tons per month on the source side, more than 50,000 tons in Taiwan are allocated to transportation, water and electricity agencies, and factories, etc. The Resources Committee is paying special attention to coal production. It is estimated that the Northeast can produce 5 million tons next year, and one-fifth of it can be transported to Guannei. As soon as Huludao thaws next spring, it can begin. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine, which can produce 1,000 tons of white coal per day, has been recovered by the National Army and is actively producing. There are 140,000 tons of coal stored there. Unfortunately, the railway from Jiaozuo to Xinxiang has not been repaired, and the road is long, making it difficult to transport by train. We have now tried to negotiate with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and will arrange for trucks to transport the coal from Xinxiang after it is transported from the production area.</p>
<h3>Jiangya Steamer Repairs Boilers; Anshun Steamer Clears Allotment Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo routes of the China Merchants Bureau are operated by the Jiangya and Jiangjing steamers. The Jiangya steamer is currently out of service for boiler repairs and is expected to be repaired within this week and resume service next week, so only the Jiangjing steamer travels between Shanghai and Ningbo. Other steamers on the route, such as Dahua and Jiangsu, operate as usual. The Cai E steamer of the Beiyang Shanghai-Tianjin route returned to Shanghai last Saturday. It was originally scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 10th, but it was immediately repaired due to damage to the first-class cabin and is scheduled to sail to Tianjin tomorrow. The Taikoo Steamship Company's Anshun steamer, on October 2, 1941 (that is, the 30th year of the Republic of China), loaded cargo and passengers from Shanghai and exported them, passing through Xiamen and Hong Kong to Singapore and Penang. A fire broke out en route, which was extinguished. The goods were slightly damaged, and the company entrusted Ruifang Foreign Firm to allocate water fees. At that time, various commercial firms paid a water fee guarantee of 20%. At that time, it happened that the Japanese invaders invaded the south, and the war was in full swing, so the progress was stopped. Now that victory has been achieved, in order to clear the procedures, the company has decided that from the 16th of this month, anyone holding a water fee guarantee receipt can register with Ruifen Foreign Firm until June 30th of next year. After the registration procedures are completed, the water fee method will be negotiated.</p>
<h3>The Ruins of the City Sports Stadium; Visiting in the Rain Feels More Desolate; The Director of the Arsenal Department Is Ordered to Come to Shanghai for a Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:00 AM yesterday, Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply Area of the Rear Service Headquarters, led his subordinates, together with Ling Chengxu, Deputy Director of the First Division of the Fourth Department of the Ministry of National Defense, Yan Zi of the Shanghai East Intelligence Office of the Garrison Headquarters, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers, to re-examine the site of the explosion at the Jiangwan Sports Stadium. At that time, the cold wind and rain were heavy, and the sky was gloomy. The four charred corpses next to the western rostrum were even more miserable under the wind and rain. Commander Fu led an inspection of the explosion site for a week. Because he was worried that there was still unexpected danger, he did not continue to excavate and drove back.</p>
<p>[Another News] Shang Ji Hui, Director of the Arsenal Department of the Ministry of National Defense, was ordered by Chief of Staff Chen to come to Shanghai for a thorough investigation of the truth of the explosion and arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. He immediately discussed follow-up measures with Commander Chang and others in detail.</p>
<h3>Relevant Parties Will Hold a Meeting; The Disappearance of the Storekeeper Increases the Difficulty of Investigation</h3>
<p>According to news from relevant parties yesterday: The personnel specially dispatched by various relevant agencies to Shanghai to investigate the case may hold a meeting in the next few days to exchange opinions. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited someone in charge of investigating the case yesterday. According to the person, the truth of the fire and the exact cause of the case are still unknown. No one witnessed the situation at the time. Although the storekeeper who escaped last claimed that the fire was caused by the continuous explosion of grenades in the warehouse, it was only based on the sound of the explosion. The situation cannot be fully understood. In addition, the disappearance of the sub-storekeeper Wang Renshan and the warehouse member in charge Wu Runong has increased the difficulty of investigation. According to the situation at the time, it is judged that Wang Renshan and others are unlikely to have died. If they are indeed absconding in fear of punishment, if Wang and others can step forward to surrender and explain the daily transportation situation, it can increase the clues for investigation. In short, the truth of the case is still under strict investigation in order to clarify the situation.</p>
<h3>Qian Changzhao Inspects South China; Departs for Taiwan This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, is scheduled to fly to Taiwan, Hainan Island, Guangdong and other places at 8:30 AM this morning for an inspection lasting about three weeks. He is scheduled to fly back to Nanjing on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Exemption from Transportation Business Tax; Inland River Vessels Continue to Strive</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association previously caused a heated response to the issue of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau levying business tax on the shipping industry and submitted it to the authorities for a long struggle. Now, it has been reported that the Association has received a reply from the Ministry of Finance through the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce rejecting the request. The Association immediately convened an emergency meeting and unanimously decided to continue to strive to avoid the disaster of merchants in distress and, if necessary, to jointly go to Nanjing with the relevant parties to petition the authorities for a final struggle.</p>

<h3>Protagonist of the Scandalous Disappearance Case Before the August 13th Incident, Miyazaki Sadao, Appears in Japan After Ten Years of Imprisonment in China</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Recent news from Japan indicates that a man named Miyazaki Sadao has reappeared.</p>
<p>Who is Miyazaki Sadao?</p>
<p>On July 24th, 1937, seventeen days after the July 7th Incident and nine days before August 13th, Shanghai was at its most tense. Suddenly, at ten o'clock that evening, two Japanese military officers reported to the Wayside Road Police Station that one private first class was missing during roll call of the Japanese Marine Corps that night. The private first class's name was Miyazaki Sadao.</p>
<p>While the Japanese military requested an investigation from the authorities, the Marine Corps immediately dispatched soldiers to patrol, cut off traffic, and inspect pedestrians, creating a very tense situation.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun, then acting mayor of Shanghai, notified Japanese Consul General Okamoto, requesting him to act cautiously to avoid further agitating the public.</p>
<p>However, what was the Japanese side doing?</p>
<p>Major newspapers in Tokyo all reported the news with special headlines. Japanese warships sailed into the Wusongkou, led by the "Izumo" warship.</p>
<p>By the 26th, the situation had calmed down, and public sentiment gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>However, Miyazaki Sadao's whereabouts remained unknown.</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate was still holding daily meetings in a state of panic, but suddenly, Miyazaki Sadao was found in the river off Bazhugang, Jingjiang County!</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from Miyazaki's "confession" at the police station, with his fingerprint affixed at the end:</p>
<p>"At around nine o'clock on the afternoon of the 24th, I went alone to a brothel on Bazilu. At nine-thirty, I paid two dollars and wanted to walk back, but three people who seemed to be Chinese chased after me, demanding more money. After arguing for a while, I took a rickshaw towards the Peace Pagoda. However, when I came out of the brothel, a Japanese sailor saw me arguing with these three people. He saw me arguing with them, and because I was wearing a military uniform, I was afraid of being recognized, so I threw away my military cap and collar before taking the rickshaw to the Peace Pagoda. After passing the Peace Pagoda, I wrapped the uniform in a newspaper and hid for two nights. On the morning of the 26th, I boarded a British ship to escape. On the ship, I slept on the deck. The crew said they would report to the captain. Because I had no ticket, I was overcome with fear, so at one o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th, I jumped into the Yangtze River. By that time, the ship had already reached Jingjiang. On the 27th, I was rescued."</p>
<p>Jingjiang County sent him to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and on the afternoon of the 28th, the man was handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed him back to the Japanese military authorities.</p>
<p>However, when he was in the hands of the Japanese military, they felt they had lost a great deal of face. The protagonist of this farce was immediately arrested, accused of the crime of encroaching and selling stolen goods, and sent back to his country, where he was imprisoned until recently.</p>
<p>Miyazaki Sadao spent ten years in prison. The Japanese military authorities seemed to think that they had covered up the shame.</p>
<p>This is the behavior of a "samurai" in a country that often boasts of its "Bushido"!</p>
<h3>Two Missing Beloved Sons Wander in Public Office, Owner of Money Exchange Business Suffers Failure and Great Fright</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Yaotang, a 40-year-old from Zhenjiang, opened the Xietai Money Exchange at No. 180 Nanjing Road and resided at No. 111 Zhaofeng Villa, Changning Road. He had a wife, Gu, and a concubine, Wu, who got along well with each other. Gu had two sons, the elder named Lingdi, nine years old, and the younger named Maomao, only four years old. The family lived happily together. Unexpectedly, the Xietai Exchange suffered excessive losses recently and closed down on the 9th. Rumors spread, and creditors went to Jiang's residence to demand repayment, carrying away redwood furniture as collateral. At that time, Jiang had no choice but to let them do as they pleased and voluntarily issued written guarantees promising to repay on a specific date. After the creditors left, Yaotang also went out shortly afterward. Before long, another group of creditors arrived, and while they were making a commotion, unexpectedly, Jiang's two children, Lingdi and Maomao, went missing at the same time. After Gu discovered this, she urgently reported it to the Changning Road Sub-Bureau, requesting an investigation. The police were dispatched to investigate in all directions, but they found no clues that night. By about eleven o'clock yesterday morning, the two children were suddenly found in French Park. The gardener reported it to the Lujiiawan Sub-Bureau, which sent police to bring them back. At the same time, the Changning Sub-Bureau was notified, ordering the police to go and bring them back for verification. According to the two children, two people took them into a car and drove away quickly. After spending the night, they did not know how, they were sent to French Park the next morning. This matter is quite suspicious. Whether it was a prank by an enemy or had other intentions, it has not been clarified yet.</p>
<h3>Municipal Construction Donation Collected Only Over 6 Billion Yuan Last Month</h3>
<p>Since the first conference of the Municipal Council decided to levy additional municipal construction donations, it was handed over to the Municipal Government for implementation. The Finance Bureau began collecting the autumn municipal construction donations in November, and it is now nearing completion. Only over 6 billion yuan has been obtained, which is far from the ideal amount. The main reason is that the Finance Bureau is collecting based on the property donation registers of the former Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council, so there are only more than 160,000 households in the city, which is less than half of the current number. It is reported that the bureau is now trying to improve this so that such a phenomenon will not occur again during the winter collection.</p>
<h3>Fire Inspection Postponed Twice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Fire Prevention Propaganda Week, firefighter inspection, and fire fighting performance program, originally scheduled to be held on November 30th, was postponed because of rain and loose ground, which could not bear the weight of fire trucks. It was originally scheduled to be held at Zhongzheng Park tomorrow morning at 9:30, but due to wind and rain last night, it was decided to postpone it for the second time, and it will be held again after the weather clears.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Unloaded Over 7,000 Tons of Goods in Shanghai Last Week</h3>

<h3>Madam Lei Zhen Appeals for Nursery Fund</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Madam Zhu Yaying, the wife of Lei Zhen, chairman of the Shanghai Youyou Nursery, recently inspected the affairs of the nursery in Shanghai and decided to increase US dollars to expand the plan. After arriving in Beijing, she appealed to all parties for donations. Recently, Wang Yin'san, Liu Jingjian, Li Peiguo, and others have donated several million yuan, which will be used to expand the nursery site, enroll more children, and benefit working women.</p>
<h3>Youth Corps Receives Last Batch of Demobilized Soldiers This Morning</h3>
<p>The last batch of more than 500 demobilized soldiers of the 207th Division of the Youth Army arrived in Shanghai from Huludao yesterday and are planning to go to Beijing in the next few days. Jiang Jingguo, director of the Training Department of the Ministry of National Defense, is extremely concerned about this batch of demobilized youth soldiers and has specially sent Colonel Deng Kao to Shanghai to take care of them. The Shanghai Youth Army Demobilization Committee ended its work early, so after this batch of demobilized youth soldiers arrived in Shanghai, they were warmly received by the Shanghai branch of the Youth Corps. The Youth Corps also arranged for the Jincheng Grand Theater to screen the domestic film "Iron Bones and Ice Heart" this morning at nine o'clock as a consolation. Before the screening, the Youth Corps branch presented each person with a towel and other practical consolation gifts. Secretary-General Wu Shaoshu will also drive to the Jincheng Grand Theater to deliver words of encouragement.</p>

<h3>Case of Section Chief of Executive Headquarters Embezzling Public Funds: Investigation Completed, Public Prosecution Initiated, Wu Suiren Charged with Embezzlement, Beijing Office States in Letter That Wu Seemed Prepared for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Wu Suiren, a clerk in the Disbursement Section of the General Affairs Department of the Executive Headquarters, embezzling public funds for lending and earning interest has been investigated by Prosecutor Liu Yongzhi of the District Prosecutor's Office, and a public prosecution has been initiated on charges of embezzlement.</p>
<p>According to the charges, Wu Suiren took advantage of his position to embezzle 2.7 billion yuan of the Executive Headquarters' September expenses for lending and earning interest. On October 28th, when the headquarters discovered this, Wu expressed remorse and returned all 2.7 billion yuan of public funds along with the 14.6 million yuan in interest earned. Although the Executive Headquarters did not suffer any losses, the embezzlement of public funds violated criminal law. The Director of the Executive Headquarters, Huo Doushu, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office on November 16th with the full details of the case, requesting legal action. After accepting the case, the office issued an arrest warrant and detained Wu Suiren on the morning of the 27th. The prosecution has been initiated after investigation.</p>
<h3>Three Other Remittances Found to Be Suspicious</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The Beijing office of the Executive Headquarters sent a letter to the headquarters in Shanghai stating that Wu Suiren seemed to be prepared for embezzlement. On August 16th, Wu sent a letter to the Beijing office requesting that the check be changed to a payee check for easy withdrawal. Therefore, in addition to the 2.7 billion yuan embezzlement case, there are also: (1) 1.8 billion yuan remitted from Beijing to Shanghai on September 13th to cover the UNRRA's August funds; (2) 200 million yuan remitted from Beijing to Shanghai on October 3rd to cover the UNRRA's August funds; (3) 500 million yuan remitted from Beijing to Shanghai on October 24th to cover the UNRRA's September additional allocation. All of these remittances were delayed, with the suspicion of earning interest.</p>
<h3>A Folding Fan: Second Trial, Chen Mo Denies Concealment, Insists He Purchased It in Chengdu</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Mo (also known as Chen Bingsi), who was sued by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization for concealing a folding fan from the Qianlong period of the traitor Liang Hongzhi, had a hearing at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Chen's wife and witness Cai Depei were also summoned. After the hearing, the court adjourned for another hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>First, Chen's wife was questioned. Chen's wife, wearing a black sea tiger velvet coat, red scarf, and yellow high-heeled leather shoes, said she was 28 years old. She claimed that she married Chen Mo in 1937 and moved into No. 45 Yuyuan Lane, Yuguo Road, last November. The sofa in the house was borrowed from Wan Molin, the mahogany tables and chairs were purchased from Cai Xingtai Woodware Store on Baishi Road, the four paintings by Wang Yiting were gifts from Qian Jingen, and the Qianlong-era folding fan was purchased around the tenth day of the first lunar month of 1944 at a painting and calligraphy stall outside the Wuhou Shrine in Chengdu, paying 6,000 yuan. Cai Depei can testify to this.</p>
<p>Request for Confrontation</p>
<p>Next, Chen Mo was questioned. Chen, wearing a coffee-colored camel wool robe and black leather shoes, nodded to his family as he entered the courtroom, standing in the defendant's dock with an arrogant expression. He stated that he was formerly the leader of the Advance Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army and resigned around September 10th last year. He is now in the import and export business. In August of last year, because the Advance Army Detachment had no place to live, he moved into the residence of the traitor Li Tuqun through the introduction of Tang Shengming. He left the residence at the end of August when the unit was ordered to go to Liuhe for concentration. He was not there to seal it off. This can be verified by the wife of the traitor Li, Ye Jiqing. He does not know where the residence of the traitor Liang Hongzhi is. The residence of the traitor Chen Qun was occupied by the Military Statistics Bureau. He denied that the Qianlong-era folding fan belonged to Liang Hongzhi. His account of how he purchased the folding fan was the same as his wife's. The court presented two letters of accusation from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization for the defendant to read. Chen argued: He does not know the accuser Wu Yongqing and would prefer that he appear in court for confrontation. At this point, the court ordered Chen Mo to sit aside and then summoned the witness Cai Depei to testify.</p>
<p>Merchant Testifies</p>
<p>Cai Depei said: He used to study at West China Union University in Chengdu and is now a merchant in Shanghai. He met the defendant in Hong Kong in 1939. Around the first month of 1944, he accompanied Chen Mo and Chen's wife to Wuhou Shrine, and he saw him purchase a folding fan at a painting and calligraphy stall. One side was a landscape painting, and the other side was calligraphy. It had bamboo bones and was one foot long; it looked somewhat old.</p>
<p>At this point, the court announced that further investigation was needed, adjourned for another hearing, and stated that a request for bail could be made in a separate statement. The defendant was remanded in custody after meeting with his family.</p>
<h3>Black Hat Desperately Quibbles, Jiang Shiyan's Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Shiyan, nicknamed "Black Hat," was listed as the deputy squad leader in the Huazhong Railway Company case. In March 1945, he beat the female passenger Xu Peiwen, who died from her injuries. At that time, this case caused a sensation in Shanghai. As a result, Jiang Shiyan was sentenced to life imprisonment by the puppet court. After the victory, the case was investigated by the Prosecutor's Office of the Shanghai High Court, and a public prosecution was initiated according to law. The case is currently being heard by the High Court. Now, the High Prosecutor's Office, believing that Jiang Shiyan was a puppet official who abused the power of the enemy and puppets to kill travelers, has added a charge of traitor against him. The High Court heard the treason part of the case yesterday morning. The defendant, wearing a dark blue woolen cotton robe, gave extremely cunning testimony. He only admitted to a verbal dispute and denied beating Xu Peiwen to death. The court then confronted him with the medical records from the Shanghai Sanitarium and the confessions from the puppet police station and local court. The defendant stammered. After the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Yongqing, stood up to defend him, the court decided to pronounce the sentence on the 18th, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Police Chief's Embezzlement Case, Sentenced to Three and a Half Years, Not Satisfied</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Nasmes, a Hungarian serving as the chief of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Station, embezzled 245,000 yuan of the station's fines between April and October of this year. The station discovered this and immediately transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The case was heard in court yesterday, and the defendant confessed to embezzling public funds. However, he claimed that he had been engaged in anti-Japanese work for many years and hoped to be leniently sentenced. The judge then stood up and pronounced the sentence in court, saying that Nasmes' confession was honest and granted a reduced sentence, sentencing him to three years and six months of imprisonment and depriving him of his civil rights for three years. The embezzled funds were to be recovered. The defendant expressed dissatisfaction with the sentence and stated that he would appeal to the High Court.</p>
<h3>Youth in Impersonation and Extortion Case, Rui Weiyin, Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Du Zhenhuai came from Taizhou, Subei, and opened the Guanmei Soy Sauce Shop at No. 245 Garbage Pond, Yangjiadu, Pudong. On November 6th of this year, a young man came to live there, claiming to be Rui Weiyin, the vice chairman of the Three People's Principles Youth League and a reporter for the News Agency (note that the agency was ordered to stop publishing in September). He pointed out that Du came from Subei and was suspected of being a Communist Party member and extorted 5 million yuan from him. Du refused. The next day, the young man, accompanied by two military policemen, went to threaten him again. Du engaged with them in some conversation and immediately reported the information to the Yangjiadu Police Station. The station sent police to take the three men back for questioning. The two military policemen were immediately transferred to the Military Police Headquarters for handling. Rui Weiyin was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Okinawa Inventory Small and Old, Supply Bureau Stops Selling Jeeps</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, visited Okinawa Island a week ago to inspect surplus US materials. It is reported that Director Jiang found during this inspection that some materials, especially Jeeps, were scarce and severely damaged, with missing parts and no way to repair or use them. Therefore, it is planned to return them to the US military authorities and not count them in the purchase item. As a result, the bureau will stop selling Jeeps. There are very few currently being repaired in Shanghai, and they have already been pre-allocated, so sales to other customers who have applied to purchase them will be canceled.</p>
<p>In addition, the bureau currently has approximately 400 employees working at the surplus materials storage area on Okinawa Island. All of their supplies on the island need to be transported from here. Because the season is cold, the bureau has prepared a large batch of winter clothing, which will soon be sent to the island to supply them.</p>
<h3>Dredging Mud Accumulation in Suzhou Creek and Huangpu River Section</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Harbor Bureau recently received reports from many inland river shipping companies that the riverbed at the starting point of the Suzhou Creek entrance to the Huangpu River is rising daily due to tidal fluctuations and mud accumulation, which is threatening ships with heavier displacement. Therefore, it has dispatched dredgers to dredge the section first, and it is expected to remove the accumulated mud in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Store Robbed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, a female store clerk at Rongkang Woolen Fabric Store, No. 271 Guangdong Road, opened the back door to wash the chamber pot and discovered that a large batch of woolen fabrics on the second floor warehouse was in disarray. Upon closer inspection, she found that the north window had been opened. She shouted loudly, and after the employees and apprentices got up to check, they found that one piece of Zhongfang Hailishi and two pieces of Honeycomb brand camel wool, worth a total of 2.57 million yuan, had been stolen. Afterwards, the person in charge, Ren Xiang, reported it to the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Bleak Hardware and Used Goods Industry Cannot Bear to Recall the Mantingfang, The Prosperous Era Has Become History</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "Jinyuli" and "Mantingfang," these names are beautiful enough—beautiful to the point of being ironic. Walking into an archway-style gate, you enter a dirty and dark alley. Following the damp cobblestone road, you turn west and pass through a dark teahouse. "Jinyuli" ends, followed by "Mantingfang," not a garden full of fragrant flowers, but some dim, rusty brass and white iron. Although this place is called "fang" (neighborhood), it is actually a narrow street, reaching Shilou to the west and Xishanglin Street to the east. In this short street, shops are set up, displaying many stalls of scrap copper and old iron. These stalls are similar to the loads carried by small coppersmiths, but larger in area. From east to west, there are more than twenty large ones. Some people, because they have no business, may rest for two days or even a day.</p>
<p>History of Stalls Over Forty Years</p>
<p>The place has a historical origin. According to the stall vendors, stalls have been set up here as early as forty years ago. At first, it was incense and hardware, but slowly the incense industry declined, while the hardware industry became more and more prosperous, from few to many, from small to prominent. Some have gone from stall vendors to shop owners; some have expanded from small stalls to large stalls; some have changed from helpers to self-employed; some have flown high and far away and become giants in the hardware industry. In short, the people here have passed on from father to son, from master to apprentice, and after forty years of the rise and fall of the times, the name "Mantingfang" has been established. The stall vendor stretched his hand out of his sleeve and pointed to a hardware store opposite, saying, "That store was originally a stall vendor, but later it changed into a store." I looked at the store. The storefront was small, and the wares were messy, but compared to the stalls, it was outstanding. The store owner might feel proud. After years of hard work, he has finally acquired this family business, although this business, as it looks now, is still inevitably depressed and declining.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends, Many Varieties</p>
<p>The goods here are mostly odds and ends, such as huge steel pliers, small copper locks, hammers, drills, iron rods, files, etc... There are also machine parts, vehicle materials, etc. Because they are messy and miscellaneous, it is most suitable to sell them by stall vendors. People with vision may want to come and rummage around. A discarded machine may find an inexpensive part here to be reused; a broken car may get what it needs here and run again. But these are all things of the past. Now this place has become very deserted. The stall vendor said to me, "You have been here for half a day, have you seen a single stall do business?" Indeed, not only has no business been done, but even people who inquire have not appeared. Even if someone buys a small part, it is a drop in the bucket for them. Their hope is to clear all the goods together and change to another industry. They are not satisfied with occasionally selling one or two items. Perhaps they are happier when reporters come to talk to them, so they can use this opportunity to complain!</p>
<p>Victory Arrives, Inventory Devalues</p>
<p>From 1944, during the period when the enemy plundered scrap iron, it seemed to be their prosperous period. Their goods were not subject to the plunder, and things were scarce and expensive. They really made a small fortune at that time. But after the victory, the puppet currency was valued at 200 to 1, and the inventory devalued, and business immediately declined!</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Coming to Shanghai Expected to Increase, Port Authority Decides to Prepare Properly to Cope with Congestion at Docks and Warehouses</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The eleventh meeting of the Shanghai Port Authority was held in the Municipal Government Auditorium yesterday morning. The meeting noted that the relief supplies transported by UNRRA have been arriving in large quantities, and the American seamen's strike has been resolved. In the future, the number of ships coming to China will increase daily. Whether the pontoons and docks in the port are sufficient to accommodate the berthing and whether the warehouses are sufficient to unload is a matter that requires early planning. It was specially decided that the Maritime Group and the Warehouse and Dock Group of the committee should quickly investigate separately and urge the relevant responsible units to prepare properly to avoid congestion problems again, and to negotiate with the Executive Headquarters for handling.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the security of the UNRRA-transported relief supplies, the Inspection and Security Group of the Port Authority invited representatives from UNRRA, Getz, the Jianghai Customs, the Port Police Station, the Municipal Police Bureau, the Water Police Bureau, and the Inspection Group to discuss the matter and drafted measures for the security of relief supplies. The meeting yesterday approved the division of responsibilities. Finally, it was also resolved that the case of the construction of a south district truck ferry plan would be handed over to the Public Utilities Bureau for handling.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Peeling Hands</p>
<p>Asked by Xu Wenkui</p>
<p>I suffer from a skin disease on my hands. The palms are red and peeling, and one joint on my fingers cannot be straightened. Where the skin is not peeling, it is firm, thick, and rough. I don't know if it's dyshidrotic eczema, and how should I treat it?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your condition is likely dyshidrotic eczema, but there are many types of skin diseases. It is advisable to consult a doctor for diagnosis and medication.</p>
<p>(2) Many Illnesses for Postpartum Woman</p>
<p>Wei Jifu asks: Two months after childbirth, a woman suddenly suffered from swollen feet. A hard, movable lump appeared on the side of her neck, and it is gradually increasing in size. The local doctor said it was scrofula, and repeated treatments have not been effective. Recently, another lump has grown elsewhere. Please answer: (1) What is this disease? What is the cause? (2) The woman has not had her period for nine months. Is this related to the illness? (3) What kind of doctor should she consult for this condition? (4) The woman has been suffering from this for a long time, and her body is weak and emaciated. Can she take tonics? What is suitable? (5) The child is nine months old, and the fontanelle on the top of the head has not yet closed. Is this a congenital deficiency? Is it beneficial to take calcium, Haliver oil drops, and milk powder? (6) If the child drinks the milk from the mother with the hard lump on her neck, will it harm the child's health?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] (1) This hard object is a swollen lymph node. The causes can be tuberculous, syphilitic, and pyogenic, among others. (2) During breastfeeding, a woman's period may be temporarily suspended. (3) All public hospitals in Shanghai can treat this, and the fees are relatively low. (4) If the woman is weak, she can take cod liver oil and various other tonics. (5) The anterior fontanelle of a child usually closes around one year of age. Your child is only nine months old and the anterior fontanelle has not yet closed, so it cannot be called a congenital deficiency. Calcium, vitamins, and milk powder complement each other and are very good, but avoid excessive amounts. (6) If the hard object the woman has is infectious, it can infect the child.</p>

<h3>Completely Eliminate the Black Market for Cotton Yarn: Concrete Plan Principles Have Been Established; Government Provides Foreign Exchange but Requires Cotton to be Exchanged for Cotton Yarn; Cotton Spinning Association Discusses Implementation Plan Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to completely eliminate the black market for cotton yarn, Premier Song summoned Wu, the concurrent chairman of the Cotton Management Committee, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, and Rong Yixin again yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss concrete plans. It is rumored that the basic principles have been generally determined, and the main points are as follows: (1) Raw materials: (A) A small committee for reviewing the allocation of raw cotton will be established, with Li Yu, director of the Allocation Department of the Executive Committee of the Women's Management Committee, and one representative each from national and private yarn factories serving as members. (B) Within the limit of permitted raw cotton imports, each yarn factory will be allowed to allocate it themselves. (2) Finished products: In principle, it is stipulated that cotton yarn be exchanged for cotton. In other words, the government will provide foreign exchange for purchasing cotton and simultaneously recover a portion of the cotton yarn at a negotiated price. Any surplus will still be freely bought and sold by each yarn factory. (3) The operations of national and private yarn factories will be unified. In addition to the Spinning and Construction Company, which has already resumed the listed system, the opening of yarn by private factories should be handled centrally by the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association. The association will still organize an allocation and sales committee to open yarn by listing prices. (4) Before each opening of yarn, the standard price for each type of yarn should be negotiated based on its quality and type, under the principle of being lower than the market price. The pricing should be flexible and can be adjusted according to market needs and the factory's own yarn inventory.</p>
<p>The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, following Premier Song's instructions, convened a meeting of executive directors yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Liu Jingji, Guo Qiong, and others attended. The principles decided at the meeting summoned by Premier Song were made into a plan, which will be submitted to the regular meeting of the Cotton Management Committee at 3:00 PM on the 12th for discussion. At the same time, detailed implementation rules will be studied.</p>
<p>According to a person involved, the government's opening of foreign exchange settlement for American cotton imports will be handled in quarterly installments (i.e., three months). Based on the current production volume of cotton yarn in China, the permitted import limit for each quarter is estimated to be approximately 200,000 to 300,000 bales. At that time, in order to promote domestic cotton, the government will match a certain proportion of domestic cotton based on the amount of American cotton applied for purchase. It is also observed that if the cotton-yarn exchange system is implemented, the government will be able to supply the textile industry with the large amount of raw cotton it needs, and the government will also be able to easily obtain a large amount of cotton yarn. Although there will still be a surplus for factories to buy and sell freely, it will be a small portion. Therefore, it is expected that the future trend of yarn prices will undoubtedly be stable. At the same time, in the future, the opening of yarn will be listed, and national and private yarn factories will take the same steps. Pricing will also be flexible, so it is expected that the black market for cotton yarn can be eradicated as a result.</p>
<h3>Many Market Rumors: Black Market for US Dollars Soars; Gold Prices Also Driven Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold was mostly stable. It opened at 2.85 million in the morning, and after opening, there were continuous closures of long positions, which proved unsustainable, and the price gradually declined. The low price dropped to 2.835 million again, and the Central Bank immediately allocated 140 bars at a price of 3.84 million. After 10:00 AM, the price gradually stabilized after the low, and was absorbed step by step by actual sales. Those with surplus funds also chased after the purchase. The supply of gold stopped slightly, and the price rebounded to 2.865 million at noon. In the afternoon, foreign currencies rose sharply, and rumors boosted buying. The Central Bank suppressed the market accordingly, so the overnight transaction was only reported to have risen slightly. Finally, it rose to the 2.9 million level, an increase of 45,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were raised to 3.04 million. The price of silver ingots and silver dollars was slightly lower. The covert interbank lending market was still stable. The interest rate was still at one cent and two to one cent and a half.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange was slightly stronger yesterday. The supply of Hong Kong dollars was in short supply, and it was still beautiful. The black market for US dollars started at 5,000 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 5,050 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors of exchange rate changes, and buying suddenly increased. Finally, it rose to over 5,250 yuan, an increase of over 200 yuan compared to the previous close. The reserve of Hong Kong dollar drafts was limited. Due to the demand from wool merchants and Western merchants, it rose sharply, soaring 60 yuan, with Hong Kong exchange rate at 1,010 yuan, British exchange rate at 16,200 yuan, and Indian exchange rate at 1,220 yuan. In the afternoon, there were no selling prices, and very few transactions occurred.</p>
<h3>Scarce Government Bond Trading</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to fluctuate yesterday, and trading was suddenly scarce. Only a little over one million yuan was traded. Transactions were made by Room 360 on the fifth floor, which slightly purchased bonds, while Room 533 slightly sold miscellaneous brands. Morning opening for Tongbing bonds was 1,100 yuan, low price was 1,090 yuan, high price was 1,140 yuan, and the result was a slight decrease of 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Jiayi, Yi, and Wu each rose 30 yuan, while Tongding rose 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong American Bank Lifts Freeze on Deposits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 11th] The Hong Kong branches of Citibank and Chase Bank of New York have lifted the freeze on all pre-war deposits. American Express has also announced the lifting of the freeze on pre-war account holders' accounts.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Slumps; Silk Goods Have a Dim Future</h3>
<p>Due to a lack of buyers, the black market price of 120-count bright rayon slumped by 450,000 yuan yesterday. The asking price at Gaoshan was 3.16 million yuan, but there were no transactions. The price at Tianqiao remained the same as the previous day's offer. Semi-bright and 150-count bright rayon also remained unchanged. There were more than 20 bales of factory silk traded on the market yesterday. The price for grade 81 C was 4.025 million to 3 million yuan. The price for grade 75 E old goods was 3.85 million yuan, and the price for new goods was 3.9 million yuan. There were still no transactions for dry warp silk. The future of silk goods is bleak. Market prices are below cost, mainly due to sluggish trading.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>The Anglo-American tea market saw little activity. British export firms demanded high-end aged Keemun teas but negotiations remained deadlocked and trade volume remained low. Market conditions remained stable. Lower quality green teas such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei were even harder to sell. High-end varieties are priced too high, profit margins are clear. It is known that Wuchang Tea Company is showing interest in new pearl teas and new Zhenmei teas from this year, and is currently negotiating with sellers. Domestic sales of red and green teas continue to show no improvement, and people are generally pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Green Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chaoshan green sugar was temporarily out of stock, so the price of Daogreen brand increased by several thousand yuan, with a higher opening price of 98,000 yuan, and a lower opening price of 96,000 yuan. Shantou sub-red was 100,800 yuan. Guangbang sheet green was 82,000 to 3,000 yuan. Xinghua white was 133,500 yuan to 131,000 yuan, and a lower price was 124,000 yuan. Xingred was 130,000 yuan to 118,900 yuan. The guild's clearing price for spot medium sugar was 133,500 yuan, and raw sand red was 118,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Exports Increase; Total Volume 980,000 Kilograms; Total Value 26 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the war, the export volume of Chinese raw silk in overseas markets has been increasing. I recently learned from China Silk Corporation that the export volume and value statistics of Chinese raw silk and silk fabrics this year are as follows: Export volume of raw silk: 634,971 kilograms, value 21,520,621,170 yuan; silk thread: 17,444 kilograms, value 503,031,000 yuan; silk fabrics: 42,099 kilograms, value 2,249,341,483 yuan; waste silk and silk cotton: 273,616 kilograms, value 732,751,500 yuan; rayon blended fabrics: 18,303 kilograms, value 1,022,120,600 yuan. Total: 986,427 kilograms, total value 26,278,656,900 yuan. Export countries: raw silk to the United States: 344,903 kilograms, value 25,833,786,47 yuan; European countries: 71,831 kilograms, value 3,121,742,000 yuan; India, Burma, and Thailand: 148,385 kilograms, value 4,721,542,000 yuan; Egypt and South Africa: 725 kilograms, value 13,461,846 yuan; others: 62,617 kilograms, value 1,959,340,000 yuan. In addition, India, Burma, and Thailand rank first in the export of silk thread and silk fabrics, followed by European countries, with a total volume of 351,456 kilograms and a total value of 4,507,244,583 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Struggle to Survive Due to Raw Material Shortages and Price Limits Below Cost</h3>
<p>The flour milling industry in this city is second only to the cotton textile industry. Flour mills throughout the city have 4,800 large mills, 102 small mills, 114 motors, and 10,200 horsepower. Currently, due to electricity restrictions, production has been greatly reduced. According to industry leaders, the industry's production is limited on one hand by electricity restrictions, preventing full operation, and on the other hand by raw material restrictions. The amount of wheat needed for flour is insufficient in China and relies heavily on foreign imports. In recent months, various countries have restricted exports, so the source of supply has become an increasing problem. If there are no more foreign wheat imports in the future, some factories may have to stop production next year. In addition, the manufacturing cost of the industry is very high, and the price limits are low, making it difficult for factories to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Slowly Decline, Only Hongji Waste Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The coal market for bituminous coal sees increasingly sluggish sales due to the factory's existing allocation. Market prices are frequently declining. Among white coals, only Hongrui lumps and Yangquan lumps are relatively stable due to strong sales of stove coal. Jiaozuo lumps and others have slightly declined. Only Hongji white coal waste remains firm due to a severe shortage of supply, with transactions occurring at 450,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Measures for Foreign Businesses Operating in Shanghai Have Been Formulated</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Supplementary measures have been formulated for the regulations governing the operation of foreign businesses in this city. The required documents are as follows: (1) Commercial registration application form. (2) Nationality certificate of the person concerned or the agent. (3) If the business is a partnership, the original or a copy of the partnership agreement and the names and addresses of the partners. (4) If the head office is located in this country or in other commercial ports or this city within China, and the registration is for the establishment of a branch, the original or a copy of the commercial registration certificate of the head office. (5) If a manager or agent is appointed, the name, nationality, address, and proof of authority must be stated in the application form. If the manager is a foreigner, a nationality certificate must be added. (6) If approval from the competent authority is required by laws and regulations, the approval document must be added. (7) Foreign business operation investigation form.</p>
<h3>Relevant Authorities are Studying the Use of Factory Buildings as Collateral</h3>
<p>National banks are providing industrial loans, but the restrictions on collateral are very strict. Machinery and factory buildings cannot be used as collateral, which has caused great difficulties for the industrial sector. They have successively petitioned the government authorities to improve the industrial loan measures. The Shanghai China Industrial Association recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating: "Upon investigation, national banks provide industrial loans with low interest rates and no limit on the amount. Regarding collateral, the Joint Treasury has recently decided that machinery can also be used as part of the collateral. As for whether factory real estate should be used as collateral, the relevant authorities are conducting thorough research."</p>
<h3>Little Change in the Rice Market; Coarse Grains are More Active</h3>
<p>The rice market saw a total arrival of over 13,000 shi of rice from the North and South. The market trend remained tight in the morning and slack in the afternoon, and it was still difficult to generate any color. Southern japonica rice saw little change in the results. The trend of flour was also quite soft. Wheat bran was as per usual weak. Soybean cake futures had a bit of activity, rebounding by 100 to 200 yuan. Yellow soybeans were taken by merchants and selected and collected by oil factories, and the market shape was stable. Kidney beans for export to Southeast Asia continued and prices continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans were dull and out of the picture. Red sorghum fell again, declining by 1,000 yuan. Corn was very popular, with no goods available on the market. Raw peanuts were active but not strong, and the trend was mediocre. High-quality sesame seeds were scarce, and Guangbang merchants were very strong in taking delivery, forming a situation where high prices were cut and leveled. Recently, due to the weather turning cold, most crude oil has frozen, and sales are unsatisfactory, falling by a small 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and the market is fluctuating. Soybean oil retail sales were still active, and there was no difference. Sesame oil has already fallen to a fixed state and is also lacking in prosperity.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Requests Loans Totaling 66 Billion Yuan; Each Loom to be Mortgaged for 12 Billion Yuan; Request Being Submitted to Government Authorities for Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The electric silk weaving industry in this city, facing difficult circumstances, has submitted documents to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Joint Treasury, requesting the government to provide assistance in terms of loans and orders. Regarding the loan measures, the industry's specific requests are as follows:</p>
<p>I. Relax the loan amount and mortgage measures as follows:</p>
<p>A. The total loan amount is 66 billion yuan, with a loan of 12 million yuan per loom (estimated total number of looms is 5,500).</p>
<p>B. Each loom and equipment is mortgaged for 6 million yuan, semi-finished products on the loom are mortgaged for 4 million yuan, and finished woven products are mortgaged for 2 million yuan, totaling the above amount (if there are no semi-finished products on the loom or the number of finished woven products is insufficient, the amount will be deducted based on the actual amount).</p>
<p>C. Use of the loan</p>
<p>(1) Repay old debts and high-interest loans</p>
<p>(2) Purchase raw materials</p>
<p>(3) Pay wages and other expenses</p>
<p>The above three items shall not be used for other purposes</p>
<p>D. The interest rate shall be 2.2% per month, following the precedent of silk cocoon loans.</p>
<p>II. Accept orders from state-owned agencies, following the same industry practice of releasing materials for subcontracted weaving. State-owned agencies will issue raw materials and customize silk loans that meet export standards. Detailed methods will be stipulated separately in the contract.</p>
<p>Regarding orders, the industry association suggested that the factory silk stored by the China Trust Bureau be processed by the industry's factories and transported to Southeast Asia, the United States, Canada, and other places to open up overseas markets. The petition also pointed out that the China Trust Bureau's price for each carton of rayon is 2.8 million yuan, while the price of the government's barter trade with Japan is only 500,000 yuan per carton according to the Hong Kong market price, and the profit amount is more than 2 million yuan per carton. As of now, the factories that have purchased the products include 5,400 cartons from the Property Management Office and 4,300 cartons from the China Trust Bureau, for a total government profit of 20 billion yuan. Therefore, if national banks and bureaus can release funds at this time, it would truly be "taking from the same industry and using it for the same industry." Finally, it was expressed that if the request is not approved, the factories have no other choice but to close down and transfer all factory properties, machinery, and more than 20,000 workers and staff to the state for proper disposition.</p>
<h3>Qishan Monosodium Glutamate Sets Up Distribution Center in Shanghai</h3>

It is rumored that the selling price of cigarettes in Tianjin is not higher than that in this city. Most of the shipments are factory goods, which is a test of the market.</p>
<h3>Foreign Pine Timber Selling Well</h3>
<p>The timber market saw foreign pine timber sales increase because the quantity of foreign pine timber arriving this month was quite small. The market price of foreign pine timber has increased. It is rumored that construction has started in other ports, and they are searching Shanghai for pine timber, so the market is booming. Chinese fir is still fluctuating at low levels.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Japanese Yarn to be Shipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 11th] In order to save the crisis in the textile industry, the Hong Kong government previously sent personnel to Japan to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters for the shipment of Japanese yarn to Hong Kong. The result was satisfactory. The first batch of Japanese yarn will arrive in Hong Kong on the 23rd, and will be allocated to various textile factories and the ban on the export of cotton textiles will be lifted.</p>
<h3>Hesitant Trading in the Morning Hua Stock Market, Strong Buying Interest in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Hua stocks felt sluggish midway through yesterday's session. Rumors of buying support sparked short covering. Stocks opened slightly higher, building on the previous day's momentum. No. 70 and No. 145 advanced on forward Yongsha, and No. 151 and No. 92 advanced on spot Yongsha. A brief rally saw prices rise by ten yuan. However, forward Yongsha struggled to maintain its price above 420 yuan. No. 173, No. 215, No. 152, and No. 16 quickly sold, driving the price down to around 405 yuan. Despite some buying by No. 199, No. 87, and No. 99, it was difficult to sustain a price above 410 yuan. Selling by No. 180, No. 61, and No. 160 pushed the price down further, nearing the 400 yuan mark. After a struggle, No. 89 seized the opportunity to pressure the price, breaking through the 400 yuan barrier. No. 186 also sold, signaling a decline. After No. 89 arbitrarily suppressed prices, spot Yongsha saw a low of 390 yuan. No. 160, No. 215, No. 16, No. 229, No. 102, and No. 180 took advantage of the low prices to buy, causing a slight rebound. However, No. 89, No. 142, and No. 31 continued to sell, taking profits. Prices were pushed lower again near noon. No. 180 bought on the dips, while No. 38, No. 151, and No. 44 came in to buy. The market stabilized slightly before closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha and Xinho fell by half a percent, and Meibing fell by slightly less than one percent. Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng saw limited losses. Cold stock Matches rose by slightly less than one percent, with the remaining stocks showing mixed results. Forward Yongsha, Xinho, and Qinxing fell by half a percent, Meiya fell by slightly less than one percent, and Huaxing, Jingfu, and Xinguang saw slight losses. In the afternoon, after a flat opening, buying was supported by gold and banknotes. No. 232, No. 233, No. 213, No. 224, No. 199, and No. 145 successively bought, with buying interest exceeding usual levels. Guangbang investors from outside the market eagerly bought, and counterparties actively covered their positions in the market. Rumors circulated about the lifting of price controls on yarn and cloth, the success of Sino-American loans, and changes in exchange rates. The buying spree intensified as the market approached closing, surging by over thirty yuan and closing at a high price. Bids continued to rise after closing. Compared to the previous close, Yongsha, Xinho, and Jingfu rose by half a percent, Meiya was flat, Huafeng and Xinguang rose by slightly less than half a percent, Qinxing rebounded by one percent, and cold stock Matches rose to its limit. The remaining stocks showed minimal gains or losses due to a lack of counterparties in the after-market. Forward trading was only conducted for half a day and therefore showed a downward trend. Qinxing, Yongsha, and Xinho fell by half a percent, Meiya fell by slightly less than one percent, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Huafeng saw slight losses. Off-market stocks were generally stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks experienced a sudden recovery under the support of Western merchants yesterday. Stocks reversed upwards after initially falling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Steel slightly decreased, while Paper, Yipi, Yeguang, and Defeng slightly increased, Shipping and Yisha each rose by half a percent, and Yinglian rebounded by one percent.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Education Representatives Hu Shi and Others Submit Recommendations, Requesting the Government to Pay Attention to Educational Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] National Assembly representatives from the free professional education sector, including Hu Shi, Cao Chu, Ye Suzhong, Ge Wei, Yang Zhan, Huang Zhaoxiong, Chen Bai, Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jianbai, Zhou Houxu, Wang Ziyu, Wang Yizhou, Gu Tonghe, Zhu Jingnong, Chen Xifang, Liang Xinda, Zhang Yi, and Ruan Zhidato, submitted a proposal to the National Assembly requesting the government to pay attention to the major issues currently affecting education. The original proposal is excerpted below: Education is the foundation of a nation and the basis for implementing democratic politics. As the Constitution is being drafted and the government is about to return power to the people, the widespread promotion of education is particularly essential to enable the people to have the capacity to implement the Constitution and exercise political power. In addition to the Constitution containing comprehensive and adaptable provisions for education to ensure that the nation's basic policies can be implemented without hindrance, we must express our views on important current educational matters for the government to consider in its educational arrangements and to encourage those in society who care about education to sympathize, unanimously advocate, and promote their realization.</p>
<p>Employ Specialists to Improve Efficiency</p>
<p>First, the government should employ specialists to manage education. Education in modern times has become a specialized discipline, and educational undertakings in general society are even more specialized. Therefore, those who manage education must have specialized knowledge and experience. Currently, those engaged in educational administration and teaching lack knowledge and experience. Many people still believe that anyone can manage educational administration and educational undertakings, and that anyone can be a teacher. Therefore, various unqualified individuals advance, and achievements are not remarkable, and education is not taken seriously. These errors must be corrected immediately. The government must carefully appoint educational administrative personnel at all levels. Educational authorities must pay attention to employing specialists related to the education being provided. Middle and primary school teachers should be filled by those who have received normal school training, so that educational efficiency can be improved, and the mission of education can be gradually achieved.</p>
<p>Allocate Enemy and Puppet Assets to Funding</p>
<p>Second, the government should allocate huge sums of money to actively manage education. During the Anti-Japanese War, education and culture suffered the most damage. Since the victory, the restoration of education and culture has been the slowest. Society has failed to provide widespread assistance, and the government has failed to do its utmost. Within the entire economic system, some people only see the consumption of education and forget the contribution of education to the future of the nation. As a result, many destroyed schools cannot be restored, and schools that should be added cannot be built. Countless children and young people are roaming the streets without schools to attend, and the situation is extremely serious. The central government should have a long-term vision and regard the restoration of education and the addition of schools as an unavoidable responsibility. It should allocate huge sums of money to subsidize the restoration of public and private schools at all levels and to add new schools to accommodate out-of-school children and young people in order to reverse the current downward trend. In addition, enemy, puppet, and traitor assets in various localities should be allocated to educational funding, because enemy and puppet assets mostly come from the exploitation of the people, and using them for education best meets the people's wishes.</p>
<p>Restore County Education Bureaus Early</p>
<p>Third, the government should restore county education bureaus and provide substantial subsidies for local education as early as possible. Local education below the county level has been disrupted by the destruction of the enemy and puppets and the impact of the centralized collection and expenditure of fiscal funds. The promotion of universal education has also been delayed, and the original independent spirit of educational funding has been completely destroyed and diverted for other uses in large quantities. For example, local educational funding before the war accounted for 40% or 50% or more, but now it has dropped to about 10%. The original educational funding was not abundant. Looking at the current situation of local education, school facilities are simple and insufficient for teaching, teachers' salaries are low, with monthly incomes of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, which cannot even maintain their personal lives. Excellent teachers have switched to other professions, and unqualified personnel account for more than 300,000 of the 600,000 teachers. There are even more than 80,000 primary school graduates who serve as primary school teachers. The seriousness of the situation is self-evident. In the future, on the one hand, provinces should be ordered to restore county education bureaus in 1947, and on the other hand, the system of guaranteeing local educational funding should be restored, and funds must be used for specific purposes. On the one hand, the central government should increase subsidies for local national education funding, at least bearing one-quarter, in order to achieve universal education as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reward and Subsidize Private Schools</p>
<p>Fourth, the government should vigorously support and subsidize private education. Currently, private schools account for more than one-third of the number of schools in our country, which shows that private education greatly benefits the national education cause. Since the victory, the government has ignored private education. Some excellent private schools are unable to rebuild, and the government has not provided effective financial assistance. This is a major defect in education. Private school teachers and staff are also national public educators, but they do not enjoy the same treatment as the state. We hope that the government will attach equal importance to educational undertakings, regardless of public or private, and provide rewards and subsidies to private schools and equal treatment to private school teachers. As for private schools that were destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War and still want to restore their schools, we hope that the government will provide effective financial assistance.</p>
<p>Raise Teachers' Salaries Immediately</p>
<p>Fifth, the government should raise teachers' salaries. Educational personnel, whether engaged in national education or other levels of education, hold the key to the nation's new life. Recently, due to high prices and difficult living conditions, teachers at all levels are feeling pain, especially primary school teachers. How can educational efficiency be achieved if teachers cannot be fed and clothed? Currently, the transfer and retreat of teachers at all levels has become a common phenomenon. If active rescue is not taken, it may cause extremely serious consequences. It is hoped that the government will have the greatest determination and make the greatest decision to immediately raise teachers' salaries so that they can meet the actual needs of local life and increase them with the increase in the cost of living so that they can work with peace of mind and specialize.</p>
<p>Strictly Order the Return of Occupied School Buildings</p>
<p>Sixth, the government should strictly supervise and order the return of school buildings and other buildings occupied by defendants. At the beginning of the victory, the order was unsettled, and many troops and administrative organs occupied the houses of schools and cultural institutions. When the order was restored, education should be restored at the same time, but the occupied school buildings and other buildings are often not returned for a long time. As for ten schools, they cannot be restored early. Although the government has issued a notice, it has not been thoroughly implemented. I hope the government will strictly order its subordinates to seriously handle it and return it immediately, so that the education community will not develop resentment.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Promulgates Regulations for Substitute National Schools; Municipal Education Bureau Ordered to Comply</h3>

After receiving this instruction, the municipal education bureau will formulate specific measures to follow and implement.

(Article 3) Substitute national schools are subordinate to the county (city) government or the education administrative organs directly under the jurisdiction of the municipality, and are subject to the management, supervision, and guidance of the competent authorities. However, the original board of directors of the school may still provide opinions, which shall be adopted and implemented by the competent authorities. (Article 4) After a private primary school is converted into a national school, its expenses shall be borne by the county (city) government or the municipal education administrative organs. However, the original property of the private primary school shall still be managed by the board of directors of the private primary school for the purpose of enriching school equipment, etc., and shall not be nationalized. (Article 5) After a private primary school is converted into a substitute national school, its principal shall be appointed by the county (city) government upon recommendation by the school board. Teachers shall still be hired by the principal. The original principal and teachers shall not be removed unless they are unqualified or there are circumstances specified in Article 12 of the National School Teachers and Staff Appointment and Treatment Protection Measures. (Article 6) Substitute national schools shall be divided into basic education, with four semesters of one to four years as a principle. When necessary, advanced (fifth and sixth grade) out-of-school public remedial education may also be established, with primary adult classes and women's classes as a principle. When necessary, advanced adult classes and women's classes may also be established. (Article 7) The curriculum, teaching materials, equipment, teachers and staff, and all other facilities of substitute national schools shall be handled in accordance with the rules of national schools and central national schools. (Article 8) After a private primary school is converted into a substitute national school, if the competent educational administrative organ intends to revoke its substitute status, or the board of directors of the private primary school requests to restore its private nature, it may restore its private nature after both parties agree. (Article 9) After a private school is converted into a substitute national school, if the original board of directors of the private primary school is unwilling to continue to operate and is willing to donate all the school's property to the public, its substitute nature may be revoked and it may be converted into a national school. (Article 10) These rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>University Ball Game Referee Problems</h3>
<p>A Good Teacher Should be a Good Referee</p>
<p>This Saturday, the University Football League will once again see Fudan and Soochow compete, and the venue and referees have been changed. Although it was not the players and referees who engaged in the brawl during the first game, the inexperience of the referees' skills cannot be ignored when investigating the origin of the dispute. Chen Ling stated at the first meeting of university sports directors that he had been away in the interior for ten years and was no longer familiar with football refereeing, so mistakes were inevitable. However, the other directors attending the meeting believed that it was an insult for a person in charge of university sports not to be able to serve as a referee. Shen Kunnan, the director of Fudan sports, also believes that a good sports instructor is not necessarily a good referee, and conversely, a good referee is not necessarily a good sports teacher. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to whether a referee is qualified before a game. When the reporter met with President Zhang Yi of Fudan University the day before yesterday, President Zhang also believed that university ball games should invite people from the referee association to serve as referees. However, we hope that the sports personnel teaching at universities will also pay attention to refereeing matters in addition to teaching sports. Of course, "a good teacher is not necessarily a good referee," but "a good teacher should be a good referee." We shouldn't have any disagreements while university sports are developing and flourishing.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Basketball Level is Lower, Qingbai Team Can Win All Games</h3>
<p>Basketball Committee Chairman Qian Xucang Returns to Shanghai to Talk</p>
<p>Qian Xucang, chairman of the Shanghai Sports Association Basketball Committee, flew to Hong Kong on the same plane with the Qingbai Hong Kong Basketball Team on the 2nd of this month. It has been ten days. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Qian returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou on a China National Aviation Corporation plane. Due to weather conditions, it did not land at Longhua Airport until 5:05 PM. He immediately drove back to his residence. According to his conversation with the reporter, football is more active than any other sport in Hong Kong Island, and the level is the highest in the country. However, the basketball level is lower than that of Shanghai. Therefore, as of yesterday, the Qingbai Basketball Team has already won three consecutive victories. Based on the situation, it can be inferred that they will be able to return in triumph with all wins. When he left Hong Kong, the Qingbai Football Team, in addition to suffering a defeat in the first game against Xingdong, still had a game in the afternoon yesterday. It is expected that all games can be completed around the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the Shanghai Star's expedition to Hong Kong, Qian said: He has contacted Mr. Zhong Zhiqiang, chairman of the local basketball association and sports director of the youth association. The Hong Kong side hopes that the Shanghai Star team will arrive in Hong Kong around the 24th, so a expedition meeting will be held in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Industry Marches Forward Against the Headwinds of Economic Downturn</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ding Weidong</p>
<p>Three Pillars: Cotton Mills, Flour Mills, Silk Mills</p>
<p>The degree of industrialization in Wuxi is second only to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line. The number of industrial electricity consumption is sufficient to prove this fact. The power plant at Qi Qiao delivers 8,000 horsepower of power to Wuxi industry every day, which is not a small amount, but the shortage of electricity is still a problem. Large industries barely have enough power, and many small industries that sprang up during the war have to install their own power generation equipment at considerable cost. According to the engineers of the power plant, to meet all the needs of Wuxi industry, it would probably be necessary to increase the power by another 8,000 horsepower per day! And this is only the current situation. With the current high profits of cotton mills and the diligence and pragmatism of the people of Wuxi, there are quite a few people who are making expansion plans. Those who ordered spindles from overseas will continue to return in the next year or two. As productivity expands, the need for electricity will become even more urgent. If we use this as a measure, we can see that the future of Wuxi's industrialization is truly limitless!</p>
<p>There are three pillars of Wuxi industry: cotton mills, flour mills, and silk mills. Due to objective environmental factors, the prosperity and decline of these three industries are very different today. During my brief trip, I had contact with people from all three industries and gained a general understanding of the difficulties and prospects of each industry. Now, I will try to provide a comprehensive report in the order of cotton, flour, and silk.</p>
<h3>Lucky Cotton Industry: Profitable as Long as Management is Sound</h3>
<p>The cotton spinning industry is undoubtedly the darling of heaven among China's troubled industries today. Demand is high while production is insufficient, the black market price is high, and raw materials are relatively cheap. Whether it is a large factory or a small factory, as long as the management is sound, there is no way not to make a lot of money. The price of cotton yarn in Wuxi is not limited, and the selling price is around 2.3 million yuan per bale. The prosperity of the yarn weaving industry can be imagined. As for the cotton mills in Wuxi, the larger ones with higher output include Shenxin No. 3 Factory and others. Please refer to the attached table below:</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen other small cotton mills with one or two thousand spindles. The above table lists the highest number of equipment in each factory. In fact, much was destroyed during the war, and some are still in the process of being repaired. Not so many are operating today. How many spindles are spinning in Wuxi today? There are two estimates: one is about 100,000 spindles, and the other is about 110,000 spindles. This means that the current yarn production is only about 60% of what it was before the war. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, when the enemy occupied Wuxi, they deeply hated the Chinese textile industry, which hindered the national policy of "Industrial Japan, Agricultural China." 70,000 spindles of Shenxin No. 3 Factory were systematically destroyed, leaving only 10,000 spindles! As for the 1478 looms, they were completely destroyed. Shenxin's experience was like this, and the fate of other major factories was similar. But today, one year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, although the country is in trouble and the social economy is turbulent, I have been able to witness Shenxin being able to restore 50,000 spindles, and the weaving factory has begun to equip itself in the burnt-out factory building. It is possible that 500 looms will be running in December. Workers and staff are working with the same enthusiasm under the brilliant electric lights; other factories also have prospects and expectations for tomorrow. The past experience seems to be just a nightmare, and everything has disappeared with the victory. I deeply feel that the Chinese people's resilience and vitality are the strongest reliance on overcoming all difficulties. The raw materials for Wuxi yarn mills are mainly American cotton, and occasionally some Brazilian cotton. Before the war, they were able to produce fine yarns of 40s and 60s counts, but now the machinery is damaged, and they can only spin coarse yarns of 20s and 30s counts. The treatment of workers is also better than in other industries, generally ranging from 80,000 to 320,000, and the treatment of technical foremen can also reach 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Their wages are calculated according to the cost of living. According to a friend in the factory, it is about 80% of the wages in Shanghai. Labor disputes in Wuxi are far less common than in Shanghai. There are two reasons: most of the major technicians in major yarn mills have been serving for many years, sharing hardships together. Over time, they gradually develop feelings. Even if there are any requests, they are made in a spirit of friendly consultation, and rarely appear in the form of strikes. Second, Wuxi is not like Shanghai. The local situation is simpler, and there is no large-scale organization or manipulation of workers, so the situation is more stable. Recently, Wuxi workers, in view of the high cost of living, have demanded that the base salary be increased by half. The management will take a rejecting attitude on this matter, so it is difficult to predict whether the labor-management relationship can be as it was in the past. As for the efficiency of technicians, one factory owner said that it is only 70% to 80% of what it was before the war. It is not physical weakness, but psychological changes. Technicians feel that they are welcomed everywhere, and "if you don't keep me here, I can find a place elsewhere." Therefore, discipline is lost, and efficiency is reduced. I usually feel deeply that, in terms of the current industrial situation in our country, except for the abnormally prosperous cotton spinning industry, the burden of wages will suffocate national industry. But today it is impossible to reduce wages. Therefore, the only remedy is how to improve workers' sense of responsibility and enable them to spontaneously improve work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Gloomy Flour Industry</h3>
<p>Compared to the cotton yarn industry, flour mills and silk mills seem dim and lackluster. The latter is even in a crisis of raw material shortages. Before the war, flour was the main industry in Wuxi. The famous Rong family started their business with flour. The stone mill they used when they started their business is still on display as a family heirloom. During the nine years of the Anti-Japanese War, Wuxi experienced a distorted prosperity due to the enemy and puppet control of food. At that time, there were many people who raised funds to open flour mills. Today, the flour factories with scale in the area should be Maoxin, Guangfeng, and Zhenhua factories, etc. There are more than ten others that are smaller in scale. The current recession is mainly due to three reasons: (1) Insufficient power supply makes it impossible to fully exert productivity, but expenses cannot be saved. According to an estimate by a gentleman in this industry: The current daily output of flour in Wuxi is only 10,000 bags, but if there is enough electricity, it can be increased to 25,000 bags. This statement is quite reliable. In Maoxin No. 2 Factory, 8,000 bags of flour could be produced daily before the war, but now the output has been sharply reduced due to lack of electricity. 5,000 bags are produced on the first day, and 2,500 bags are produced on the second day, and so on. The situation in other factories is similar. (2) The supply of raw materials used to come mostly from northern Jiangsu, but due to the occupation by the Communist army, the supply is not smooth, which affects production. (3) The current general recession in the food industry, and the flour industry is no exception; the result is that the price of raw materials rises, while the selling price of flour does not rise, so there is no profit to be made. Under the above three unfavorable conditions, the current production of the flour industry is only 30% to 40% of what it was before the war. At the same time, the burden of taxation also shrinks the industry. Now, every bag of flour is subject to a goods tax of 400 yuan, and at the end of the year, there is also income tax and profit tax. A flour mill owner told the reporter that the monthly tax expenditure is much larger than the salaries and food expenses of the employees. Under the current situation of sluggish sales, small factories are deeply affected by high-interest loans, and one or two may announce liquidation at the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Crisis: Even More Serious Than Flour Mills</h3>
<p>The crisis in Wuxi's silk industry is even more serious than that of flour mills. Before the war, there were 40 silk factories in the area. During the nine years of the Anti-Japanese War, more than 20 small factories were established, for a total of more than 60 factories, employing more than 20,000 workers. The ones with more equipment are shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Factory Name Number of Machines</p>
<p>Bada 156</p>
<p>China Silk Factory No. 6 304</p>
<p>Zhengmao 104</p>
<p>Yongchang 114</p>
<p>Jincheng 272</p>
<p>Meixin 296</p>
<p>Yongtai 312</p>
<p>Dingxin 256</p>
<p>Jiangnan First Silk Reeling Factory 360</p>
<p>All of these silk factories, large and small, are currently in a raw material panic. If the shipment of silkworm cocoons to China cannot become a reality, then all of them will stop work before the end of this month. When the autumn silk comes on the market next year, the cost will become a most serious problem. The current government purchase price is 3.8 million yuan per picul (standard silk), but the cost of autumn silk is estimated to be more than 6 million yuan per picul. They are generally grateful for the government's good intentions to support the silk industry, and hope that the purchase price in the future can be adjusted according to the actual cost. As for the problem of raw silk exports, they have a common view: that our silk production has two major weaknesses: first, the silkworm varieties are not as good as others, so the quality of the silk is also poor; and second, wages are too high, so the production cost of silk is also high. In the short term, it is still difficult for us to compete with the strong enemy Japan.</p>
<h3>A Productive City [More People Producing, Fewer People Consuming]</h3>
<p>The current situation and prospects of Wuxi's three major industries have been briefly described above. Compared with other places, it brings hope. The same is true for industry and commerce. Of course, Wuxi's commerce is also in a recession, and there are also bankruptcies. On the day the reporter arrived in Wuxi, a large pharmacy was forced to close down by high-interest loans, and a rice store with more than ten years of history was struggling with a debt of 700 million yuan. The situation is miserable enough. However, the people of Wuxi who have money use their money to run businesses, instead of seeking high-interest loans and enjoying themselves, which has a very good impact. Because once a business is established, it employs a lot of people itself, and other industries also increase prosperity due to the so-called "multiplier effect" in economics. Therefore, the situation of unemployment in Wuxi is better than in other places. At the same time, because it is a productive place, the people's purchasing power is stronger, so even in the headwinds of the commercial recession, the market situation is still good. As for the lives of Wuxi farmers, they are not as good as they used to be. In the past, they had two sources of income every year, one was rice and the other was sericulture, and their lives were not bad. Since one year ago, they have been cutting mulberry trees and planting rice, but who knows that the rise in rice prices cannot be proportional to other prices! The hard work of farmers for a year cannot even make one or two sets of clothes. The big contradiction in our country's economy now is: if the price of rice is raised, the price of labor will definitely rise, and factories will not be able to maintain themselves; on the other hand, if the price of rice is not raised, then the lives of 80% of farmers will inevitably decline, and their purchasing power will be weak, and commerce will not be able to prosper. I asked this question to a friend in a Wuxi yarn mill. His opinion was: "In the past, the government tried to stabilize prices, but neglected labor prices. In the future, they should try to reduce labor prices in order to solve the problem."</p>
<p>Wuxi is a productive city, and there are very few idle people. There are "more people producing and fewer people consuming," so not only can it be self-sufficient, but it also has surplus material resources to export. The reason why it can be like this is because the natural environment is one reason, but the main reason is still human effort. The people's frugality and pragmatism, focusing on utilizing resources and improving people's lives, have finally turned Wuxi into a "Little Shanghai" - a productive city with the advantages of Shanghai but without the disadvantages of Shanghai. If three-tenths of the cities in China can concentrate the intelligence and wisdom of the people and develop into productive undertakings like the people of Wuxi, the reporter believes that the goal of improving people's lives can be realized sooner.</p>
<h3>Enterprising Spirit: Repair Wartime Wounds, Strive to Expand Business</h3>
<p>The industrial community in Wuxi has a very strong enterprising spirit. Their greatest advantage is that they live frugally, do not engage in extravagance, and use all their talents to develop their businesses. Now, most factories have development plans. They not only want to repair the wartime wounds, but also strive to expand their businesses. Taking the yarn industry as an example, both large and small factories are placing orders overseas. For example, Shenxin Yarn Factory had 70,000 spindles before the war. It suffered heavy losses during the war and has now only recovered to 50,000 spindles. However, they are now planning to increase to 126,000 spindles! On the eve of the end of the war, they placed orders with American manufacturers, and it is estimated that a part of them will be shipped next spring. The other yarn mills ordered later, and there are currently only three factories in the United States that can manufacture spinning machines, and their own needs are also great. Therefore, the production of Wuxi yarn mills will not increase much within a year. Taking flour mills as an example, the temporary recession is not enough to make the enterprising industrialists feel discouraged. On the contrary, they have also set ambitious development plans. For example, Maoxin No. 2 Factory is planning to purchase machinery to establish a large factory in Wuxi that produces 10,000 bags of flour per day. At the same time, Maoxin No. 1 Factory is also adding new British-made flour milling machines that were used during the war. The product performance is particularly good. All of this shows their enterprising spirit.</p>
<h3>Power Problems</h3>
<p>Insufficient power has restricted industrial production in the Wuxi area, and this problem is being smoothly resolved. There are various reasons for the power shortage in Wuxi. Firstly, many small industries have emerged in the past decade, and they all require electricity. Secondly, before the war, major factories had their own generators. However, during these turbulent years, some generators were lost, and some were left unused. This extra electricity burden affected the overall balance of supply and demand. As for the Qishuyan Power Plant's power supply, it has not decreased at all because the machinery was undamaged during the war. The Shenxin Textile Mill's generator is currently being borrowed by the power company to supply Wuxi. But this is still not enough. Many small factories cannot get electricity and have to generate their own power. Large factories also have limited electricity consumption; when exceeding the limit, they must supply coal to the Qishuyan Power Plant as compensation. Now, with the efforts of all parties, major textile mills will be able to resume their own power generation by next spring. The Qishuyan Power Plant will also receive a new generator and a wartime British generator, which will increase the electricity supply capacity. Therefore, the problem of insufficient power in Wuxi can be satisfactorily resolved in two or three months. In the past and present power allocation and dispatch, the Qishuyan Power Plant has indeed worked diligently and endured hardship.</p>

<h3>The First Vital Point on the Lifeline: A Snapshot of Changchun</h3>
<p>— November 28th Airmail Report by Our Changchun Reporter, Fang Ren</p>
<p>Changchun is now like a patient suffering from anemia, a seriously ill person with paralysis on the left and right sides, and suffering from many ailments. It is a desert, and some say it is a pool of stagnant water.</p>
<p>Native-born, Locally Raised City Councilors Dare to Speak</p>
<p>First of all, I, as an audience member, must thank the establishment of the Provisional City Council of Changchun. It allows me to hear from those who are eloquent and articulate, reporting on their actual experiences of life over the years, or more seriously, reporting on their actual work over the years.</p>
<p>The Provisional City Council of Changchun was officially established on November 22nd. After its establishment, it continued to hold general meetings, which have not yet concluded. There are a total of thirty-one councilors. Eight of them come from the countryside because there are eight districts within the city limits of Changchun, and they are inhabited by farmers who make a living by farming. There are also representatives elected by labor unions, and their proposals and inquiries invariably emphasize the interests of workers as more sacred than the interests represented by any other representative. Elementary school teachers desperately exaggerate the importance of matters related to elementary school students. There are also two silver-bearded elders who insist that the five-hundred-person mixed-gender chorus organized by the city government during the Double Tenth Festival was "indecent" and the mingling of men and women was too unrefined. Several young fellows, when discussing the elimination of superstition during the passing of a proposal, shouted loudly, ordering the factories that make joss paper and the "slum dwellings" that make paper figures and horses to cease operations completely because they are the main culprits in promoting the existence of superstition! The reporter wants to particularly emphasize this point: indeed, there are quite a few councilors who have never seen the world. They are not only native-born in Northeast China, but also native-born in the rural areas of Northeast China. However, they dare to speak boldly. One thing is regrettable: among the thirty-one councilors, not one is female. Strangely, the female citizens in the audience have also been as rare as stars in the morning sky in recent days.</p>
<h3>Two Slogans: Production is More Important Than Taxation; Developing Resources is More Important Than Cutting Costs</h3>
<p>Relying solely on tax revenue is insufficient. Therefore, Director Xiao Renshu proposed two "slogans" as the standard for today's efforts to solve Changchun's financial problems: "Production is more important than taxation; developing resources is more important than cutting costs." What does it mean to create production and develop resources? According to Xiao's opinion: (1) Open up production enterprises, because although Changchun does not occupy an important position in the production industry in the Northeast, it is secondary. Most of these were contributed and established by the blood and sweat of the citizens, so a portion should be taken out for the public to enjoy. For example, if the Changchun Cigarette Factory were operated by the municipal government, the city's finances would have a great solution, but this factory was taken over by the Jilin Provincial Government. (2) Reorganizing real estate rents, a monthly income of twenty to thirty million yuan is not a problem, but those belonging to the central government were taken over by the central government; and those not belonging to the central government were taken over by the Real Estate Administration Bureau. (3) Establishing a municipal bank can make capital more flexible, unlike the national bank, which is subject to excessive restrictions. If the municipal bank converts current assets from the four major banks, this will naturally make the market prosperous, and the city's finances will naturally benefit from it. (4) Rectify tax collection so that the city's tax revenue can be fully accounted for, which will greatly benefit the city government. (5) Establish a trading market to prevent tax evasion on livestock, grain, etc. (6) Make good use of post-war relief materials. (7) Facilitate the flow of materials and strive to meet the requirements of smooth commodity circulation.</p>
<h3>Police Reform: The Authorities Have Made Painstaking Efforts</h3>
<p>In the Northeast, due to the influence of the enemy and puppet regime, "police" were always called together with "secret agents," and people in the Northeast couldn't help but feel disgust and hatred when "police" and "secret agents" were mentioned. Because in the hands of "police" and "secret agents," countless people were separated from their parents, children, and spouses under the names of "ideological criminals" and "economic criminals." They were thugs raised by the Japanese, creators of tragedies of life and death, demons who killed without blinking an eye, and complete bastards who only knew themselves and didn't know others.</p>
<p>After the central government took over the Northeast, the most difficult thing was the establishment of a new police administration. Because to make the people of Northeast China change their minds, it is necessary to completely sweep away all the bad habits of the past police as much as possible, and let these people-friendly police officers gain a new understanding from their new behaviors.</p>
<p>After the National Army entered Changchun at the end of May, it can be said that considerable effort was put into the rectification of the police administration. In addition to establishing a police training school starting on July 1, which has now trained three classes, with a total of 547 police officers after training, daily training is also implemented, with two hours of training each day, and training is also conducted during memorial weeks and various gatherings. However, after the police report, the councilors enthusiastically stood up to question, saying that on November 24, the police, while patrolling in the early morning, shot and killed an old man named Fu Shuming, who was holding a pickaxe and prying up the floor of an empty house near the Xiyang District. The police said: because they saw Fu coming with an object, "seeing the situation was not good, they opened fire," which is really suspected of committing a serious crime of recklessness. In addition, the police also accepted civil and criminal litigation cases in rural areas on the outskirts, beating and detaining people at will, and judging matters of "marriage and land" in a completely confused manner.</p>
<h3>The Sins of the Big-Nosed Soldiers: Creating Suffering Between Young Couples</h3>
<p>In the police report, there was one report that particularly caught everyone's attention. That report was a statistic, and that statistic was based on a survey of the things that the people of Changchun did not want to experience after the Soviet army entered Changchun. The statistics are: 28 rapes, 53 arson and killings, 2,842 lootings, and 16 destructions, totaling 2,939.</p>
<p>At the very moment when the Provisional City Council was meeting, such a bizarre thing happened in Changchun. It can be said to be one of the manifestations of the above statistics.</p>
<p>A young couple had a deep affection for each other. One dark night last winter, a big-nosed soldier broke into their house. Without explanation, he forcibly violated the woman and left. The young husband felt that this "disaster" was irresistible and still loved his wife. The wife originally wanted to die in anger, but seeing this, her love increased, and the two became even more "loving." Unfortunately, in October of this year, she suddenly gave birth to a son. The body and hair had many unusual characteristics. After a doctor's examination, it was proven to be a thoroughbred mixed-race child. The young husband couldn't help but wonder if fertilization was possible after forced sexual intercourse. The doctor replied that it was possible. But if this child is by their side, it will cause unpleasant feelings between the couple, and they want to put him to death. Friends advised: the little life itself is innocent, there is no need to kill. If this child really evokes sad memories, giving the child to others is also a solution.</p>
<p>Such things are endless. This can also explain one of the reasons why the compatriots in the Northeast are unhappy with certain people.</p>
<h3>A Review of the Achievements of October</h3>
<p>From "April 14" of this year back to December 22, 1945, this stage of the Changchun Municipal Government was engaged in taking over and promoting public administration under the occupation of the Soviet army. During this period, there are four things to mention:</p>
<p>(1) Organization of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Committee. This organization was composed of local gentry and various institutions and organizations convened by the municipal government. They jointly undertook the responsibility of managing enemy and puppet industries, compiling a clear list to avoid losses, and preparing to hand them over to the people sent by the central government who were responsible for the actual takeover.</p>
<p>(2) Organization of the Real Estate Adjustment Committee. This organization aimed to manage all enemy and puppet houses to prevent them from being occupied by others, and at the same time pay attention to allocating a portion of houses as residences for civilians.</p>
<p>(3) Preventing corruption. At the beginning of the takeover, there was a deep fear that unscrupulous officials would take the opportunity to commit fraud. As a result, one director and three takeover personnel were found guilty of dereliction of duty and were punished accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) Reorganization of the Baojia system. At the beginning of the restoration, it was impossible to talk about household registration and security. After the takeover, work began on this, with a total of more than 800,000 people. The situation at that time was quite successful.</p>
<p>From "May 23" to the present, the following points can be mentioned:</p>
<p>(1) Sending back Japanese expatriates and prisoners. Changchun did a considerable job in this matter. The work of repatriating Japanese expatriates and prisoners in the Northeast began on May 17, while Changchun began after the National Army entered. Changchun repatriated a total of more than 200,000 people.</p>
<p>(2) Implementation of Baomin and police patrols. This was to enable the people's strength to cooperate with the police during the winter defense period to carry out patrol duties and household registration checks. It is currently being actively promoted.</p>
<p>(3) Stabilizing prices, wages, and rents. All prices, wages, and rents are determined through price negotiations, with relevant groups jointly negotiating prices, which are then approved by the municipal government and implemented.</p>
<p>(4) Supporting cultural undertakings. In accordance with the orders of the central government, citizens enjoy extremely free speech and publication. Therefore, a considerable number of newspapers and magazines are published in Changchun.</p>
<p>(5) Appeasing young people. The Forward Command Post of the Commander-in-Chief jointly organized a youth summer training camp in the summer, which accommodated young people returning from the north of the Songhua River. It also solved employment problems for some of the trainees.</p>
<p>(6) Reorganizing the city's finances. In accordance with the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, simplifying administration and reducing personnel, and all non-urgent needs were temporarily postponed. At the same time, the city's finances were focused on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure.</p>
<p>(7) Improving public utilities and health undertakings. Improving tap water, paying particular attention to the cleanliness of drinking water. The city's trams and buses were completely destroyed in the war, but after active repairs, the number of vehicles running in the city has greatly increased. The prevention of epidemics is being handled with no regard for manpower and financial resources.</p>
<p>(8) Strengthening education. Changchun is not only seeking an increase in the number of students, but also improving the quality of teachers, and has held several teacher training sessions and strengthened normal schools.</p>
<p>(9) Improving the police administration. Changing police concepts, eliminating high-handed practices, improving service spirit, and cultivating patriotic consciousness. Especially in order to meet the requirements of Changchun's first priority of public security, all police facilities are mainly coordinated with military affairs.</p>
<p>(10) Cleaning up real estate and land administration construction. In the past, real estate files were unfortunately destroyed in the "April 14" fire, and much of the takeover work has not yet been completed. The property rights of enemy and puppet industries have not yet been determined, so a new Land Administration Bureau has been established, which will coordinate with the Finance Bureau to be responsible for cleaning up and adjusting land administration and real estate matters in the future.</p>
<p>The above are all the achievements reported. Of course, some are still in progress. However, the achievements of October can reveal some clues.</p>
<h3>Looking to the Future: Changchun Has Its Own Future</h3>
<p>Changchun is currently in suffering. But precisely because of this, people see its "desolate" current situation. Inevitably, there are many feelings. In reality, Changchun has its own "future." Looking ahead, Changchun really has a beautiful future.</p>
<p>Changchun is located in the center of nine provinces, is an important town in the Northeast, is the capital of the puppet Manchukuo, and is an important stronghold on the Sino-Soviet Railway connecting Europe and Asia. In a word, it is the first vital point on China's lifeline.</p>
<p>However, the serious fact at present is that the city's finances are insufficient. Such a grand city is plagued by poverty and confusion. If a fundamental solution to the financial resources is not thought of, the people of Changchun will be unable to maintain this city, unable to keep this city, built with the blood and sweat of the people of the Northeast, from changing its old appearance for a long time. Let alone reconstruction or anything else. Therefore, the councilors of the Provisional City Council suggest that Changchun be changed to a secondary capital, that Changchun be changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, and that the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters be stationed in Changchun. Rather than looking at it from a positive perspective, saying that it is seeking to rebuild Changchun, it is more appropriate to look at it from a negative perspective, saying that it is seeking a solution to Changchun's financial resources. At the same time, the Provisional City Council also reported that although Shanghai and Tianjin are both municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, they are also cities with a serious financial surplus. Therefore, Changchun's request to become a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan should be approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Officers and Soldiers of the 184th Division: Captured and Escaped</h3>
<p>During the battle to defend Dashiqiao, a portion of the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 184th Division were captured by the Communist Army. When Andong was recovered this time, the division, led by Regiment Commander Yang Chaolun, annihilated two battalions of rebel bandits, broke through the encirclement, and returned to Shenyang. The citizens held a general meeting to show their welcome. (Northeast Society Photograph)</p>
<h3>The Key to Tainan: Penghu</h3>
<p>— 4th Dispatch from He Minxian</p>
<p>Harbors Intertwined, Islands Stretching</p>
<p>Penghu Island's coastline meanders tortuously, with capes like intertwined dog teeth. The bay forms a peninsula, with an area of square miles. The 500-mile-long coastline faces Yuweng Island to the west, embracing a large bay. The water is deep enough to accommodate thousands of ships. Only the current Taiwan Strait is extremely dangerous. Ships sailing at sea must enter Penghu to take shelter in case of a storm to avoid capsizing. All major ports include Magong, Shili, Liangwen Port, Nanliao, Tudigongqian, Shashu, Zhenhai, Chihkan, Tongliang, Daguye, Zhugowan, Jima Creek, Nei'an, Qimen, Jiangjun'ao, Budai, and Shui'an, among others. The largest harbor is the east and west ao of Magong. The anchorage west of Xiangkou is 24 to 50 feet deep, with an area of 238,000 ping. Since ancient times, the Penghu Islands have been said to consist of 36 islands, 72 islets, 49, or 55. However, according to accurate surveys, there are only 64. It is said that although the total number of large and small islands and reefs reaches more than 60, only 44 of them can be called Yu Island. All of them can be divided into two groups: (A) the Penghu main island group (including Penghu Island, Baisha Island, Yuweng Island, and their affiliated islands). (B) the Bazhao Islands (including Bazhao Port, Jiangjunyu, Dongjiyu, Xijiyu, Dongyuping, Xiyuping, Dayu, Huayu, and their affiliated islands). The Penghu Islands are the collective name of the Penghu main island group and the Bazhao Islands. The main island (Dashan Island, i.e., Penghu Island) is in the center, Bazhao is in the south, Jibei Island is in the north, and Zha Po and Zha Mu Islands are in the east. In the west is Yuweng Island (Xiyu), with varying densities and sizes, forming a layered defense. As it is located at the key point of the Taiwan Strait, ships sailing nearby must use this island as a standard for their routes. However, the waves in the bay are surging, and the island's foot is densely covered with hidden reefs. It is not easy to moor without familiarity with the waterways. The names of each island are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Thirty-one islands in the northern part of the main island: (Baisha Island, Nanmiangua Island, Zhongdun Island, Jian Island, Jun Island, Baisha Island (same name two), Dakang Island, Yuanbei Island, Jibei Island, Wo Island, Daxue Island, Yanging Island, Jin Island, Maochang Island, Island, Xiao Island, Pingqi Island, Tudifeng Island, Jilong Island, Baisha Island (same name three), Cao Island (same name two), Xianjiao Island, Niumujian Island, Hai'an, Baisha Island, Tiezhen Island, Gupoyu Island, Maosi Island, Mudou Island, Quzhao Island, Beijiao.)</p>
<p>(B) Five islands in the eastern part of the main island: (Zha Po Island—Yang Island, Zha Mu Island—Yin Island, Xiangjin Island, Dingdiao Island, Jishan Island.)</p>
<p>(C) Twenty islands in the southern part of the main island: (Bazhao Island, Jinguazai, Jiangjun'ao, Yuhou, Dizi, Toujin, Liyue, Ma'anshan Island, Gousha Island, Chuanfan Island, Da Island, Xiyuping, Dongyuping, Zhongzai Island, Dongji Island, Hua Island, Xiaomao Island, Damao Island, Chutou Island, Cao Island (same name two).</p>
<p>(D) Five islands in the western part of the main island: (Cetian Island—Xiao Yan Island, Tongpan Island, Xiaomen Island, Hujing Island, Yuwei Island—Xiyu.)</p>
<p>Among the above islands, there are the most in the northern part, with 31, and the least in the eastern and western parts, with 5 each. As for the comparison of area, the main island has an area of more than square miles, and the area of the 63 affiliated islands combined also reaches more than square miles, similar to the main island, which is extremely coincidental. As for the origin of the island names, most of them are named after their shapes. The easternmost island is Zha Mu Island, the westernmost is Hua Island, the southernmost is Da Island, and the northernmost is Mudou Island.</p>

<h3>The Ethics of Writing</h3>
<p>— Chuantong Xian</p>
<p>Recently, this magazine received a contribution discussing a "Chemical Calculation Method" published in 1939 by Kaiming, which has recently been copied and published using a clever method of disguise. The analysis and comparison between the two are quite detailed, but unfortunately, it could not be published due to space limitations. However, this made me think about the ethics of writers. Writing is a very arduous task. If someone makes a living by writing, that is already a dead end. If someone steals and exploits, that is simply heartless.</p>
<p>This also reminds me of a lawsuit ten years ago between two bookstores because the English textbooks published by the two were similar. Some people say that Chinese people have a problem, which is that they do not know how to create through their own efforts. When they see that others have achieved slight success or a slight profit in a certain aspect, they rise up to imitate and counterfeit. For example, no one in Shanghai knows which Lu Song Company is real. What is strange is that this phenomenon also occurs in the publishing industry, which has a higher level of Chinese culture. Why can't we strive for improvement and strive for excellence? We must find ways to extinguish this mentality of speculation and opportunism.</p>
<p>The Chinese publishing industry is extremely lacking in both material and spiritual aspects. This is undeniable. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that people with capital will engage in the publishing industry, and the government will try to support them (such as providing loans and exempting sales tax on publications). On the other hand, writers should enrich their own content, work hard in research, and maintain a noble personality. At the very least, we must maintain the minimum level of writing ethics.</p>
<h3>An Introduction to "A True History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom"</h3>
<p>— Luo Hongtao</p>
<p>By Guo Tingyi</p>
<p>Published by the Commercial Press</p>
<p>Over 1400 pages</p>
<p>Price: 18,000 yuan</p>
<p>The Heavenly Capital of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fell to the Qing army on July 19, 1864 (corresponding to the 16th day of the sixth month of the third year of the Tongzhi reign). More than eighty years have passed since its demise, yet there is still no complete record of this great revolutionary movement, truly a great disgrace for historians. Now, the publication of Mr. Guo's book is just enough to make up for this major deficiency, truly a great blessing for the academic world. It is noted that people's views on the historical facts of the Taiping can be divided into four periods. From its demise onwards, the Qing court from top to bottom, as well as British and French imperialists, jointly engaged in malicious counter-propaganda, denigrating the Taiping army as even worse than bandits and brigands. At the same time, the populace fabricated various imagined cruel events, which marks the first period. Around the time of the founding of the Republic of China, the revolutionary atmosphere was already stirring, and the general public recognized the Taiping army as revolutionary martyrs. Consequently, various historical materials were fabricated (such as Mr. Liu Yazi's statement on August 20, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, that the original manuscript of Shi Dakai's poetry collection was compiled by his exiled friend Gao Tianmei. Much of it was fabricated, mostly by Tianmei, as propaganda for the revolution at the time, borrowing literature as a tool). Moreover, based on imagination, events such as Hong Xiuquan being a disciple of Zhu Jiu, Hong Daquan being named the Prince of Heavenly Virtue, and Qian Jiang submitting a memorial, appeared, creating seemingly true but false historical events, which marks the second period. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, Liu Niu Chenruo copied and printed sixteen interesting documents of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom from the British Museum. From then on, more and more people began to unearth Taiping historical materials from overseas. Mr. Cheng Yansheng from the library of the School of Oriental Languages in Paris; Mr. Xiao Yishan from the Oriental Department of the British Museum in London; Mr. Wang Chongmin from the library of Cambridge University in England; and Mr. Yu Dawei from the Prussian State Library in Berlin, all had significant harvests. (According to scholars, among the four mentioned above, Mr. Xiao's acquisitions were the most numerous, while Mr. Yu's were the most refined. Mr. Yu's portion, proofread by Mr. Zhang Jusheng, was compiled into my humble edition of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poetry and Prose Collection," but it is now out of print.) Furthermore, the Palace Museum in China also unearthed original historical materials, long hidden for a century, now reappearing to aid research, which is no small contribution. This marks the third period. However, although researching the historical facts of the Taiping became a fad among historians, what they obtained were only fragments. No one was able to conduct comprehensive research. That is, until Mr. Guo's book. In the preface, Mr. Luo Jialun states that Mr. Guo spent over a decade silently working on this issue before achieving this great harvest. Mr. Guo himself is modest, considering this book to be a historical record of tools, only seeking to prepare the way for others, hoping that historians with talent and scholarship can use it to create a complete record. This marks the fourth period. Objectively speaking, Mr. Guo's work is successful in the present situation.</p>
<p>This book's record of events begins in the first year of the Jiaqing reign and ends in the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign. In addition to specifically recording the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Rebellion, it also describes the background of this great turmoil as much as possible, such as the turmoil during the Jiaqing and Daoguang reigns, peasant uprisings in various places, and the activities of the Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society) and the Sanhehui (Triads), all within the scope of the record. The recorded facts consider all sides, but due to limitations of materials, military battles account for the majority. The facts are recorded in chronological order. The months and days recorded include both the Chinese and Western calendars, and the new calendar implemented by the Taiping army is also noted where it can be verified. The facts of the months and days are strived to be accurate. For those involving doubts, various sources are consulted for textual research, truly worthy of being called an excellent work. At the same time, the author believes that local chronicles contain some important materials that cannot be found elsewhere, so they are used as much as possible. This is a new path opened for those studying Taiping history. Although he was able to borrow reference books from Tsinghua, Central, Yenching, and Jinling Universities, as well as the libraries of the Central Political, Beiping, and Nanjing National Studies institutions, and had good support, his spirit of research is also admirable.</p>
<p>The main text of this book is worth praising, and the eight appendices are also worth introducing.</p>
<p>The first appendix is a comparison table of the Taiping calendar and the lunar calendar, as well as a brief table of days of the week. Several people had done this work before Mr. Guo. However, the Heavenly Calendar's sexagenary cycle does not match the lunar calendar's sexagenary cycle, differing by one day. Also, the Taiping day of the week does not match the Western day of the week, also being one day earlier. Due to these two differences, the previous work was completely abandoned. Mr. Guo's table, however, is worth quoting and guaranteed to be error-free.</p>
<p>The second appendix is a table of figures from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which is simply a small-scale biography of Taiping historical figures. It begins with explanations of titles and ranks, with detailed textual research. Each table is divided into items such as title, name, place of origin, experience, birth and death, and notes. The recorded events are rich, easy to check, and suitable for application.</p>
<p>The third appendix is a table of generals in major battles. Each battle records its main generals, subordinates, location, and opposing generals. There are a total of eighteen tables on the Taiping army side and seven tables on the Qing army side. These twenty-five tables cannot be written without having the entire historical facts organized in one's mind. What a rare effort.</p>
<p>The fourth appendix consists of fourteen maps of the wars between the Hong (Taiping) and Qing armies. "Left map, right history" was valued in ancient times. With these maps, reading history becomes even more interesting. Mr. Luo Jialun also states in his preface that the method of attaching maps comes from modern concepts. It would not be possible without the progress of modern technology.</p>
<p>The fifth appendix is a table of Qing ministers and officials. The sixth appendix is a table of commanders who suppressed the Nian Rebellion. Both tables record items such as office, name, term of office, original position, location of residence, and notes, which helps in checking. The seventh appendix is a brief record of generals from both the Hong and Qing sides, which is extensively collected and recorded.</p>
<p>The eighth appendix is a bibliography. The books listed are limited to those that Mr. Guo has referred to and used as a basis for compilation. The books are divided into two parts: one is Chinese, totaling 197 types, plus 380 types of local chronicles, and 8 types of periodicals; the other is Western, totaling 43 types. After each entry, a brief explanation and commentary are added to clarify its nature. There are over six hundred books cited, but what the author can say is that Mr. Guo's table is not to flaunt his collection, but Mr. Guo has actually cited them one by one. This is what makes it so valuable.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be stated that Mr. Guo's book is indispensable for those studying Taiping history. Mr. Xiao Yishan is a leading authority on Qing history and has also made many contributions to Taiping historiography, possessing the largest collection of Taiping historical books. Mr. Guo's book should have been read by him long ago. However, in recent correspondence, it is known that he still regrets not having seen this book. Even an expert is like this, let alone others. Therefore, not avoiding the risk of being meddlesome, I wrote this article to introduce it.</p>
<h3>A Masterpiece of Human Geography: The Geographical Basis of China</h3>
<p>— Junzhi</p>
<p>By George Babcock Cressey, Translated by Xue Yiyuan</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore, September of the 35th year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>The relationship between geography and human life is the closest. To understand the various human relationships in China, it can be said that we need to rely on the study of geography, because only through it can we understand the factors of agriculture, resources, climate, region, and human life.</p>
<p>Professor George Babcock Cressey, the author of this book, resided in China for a long time, completing this work after more than ten years of research and travel; at the same time, this work is also the result of his more than ten years of hard work. The author serves in China as a visiting professor under the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the United States Department of State and as a representative in China for the American Council of Learned Societies and the National Academy of Sciences; due to these many conveniences, the research work he conducts is even better than that of us Chinese. Our Chinese geographers have absolutely no opportunity to conduct research for such a long time and spend so much money. Therefore, although the author is an American, this book is still a relatively accomplished new geography work in Chinese geography.</p>
<p>Today, this book is worth reading whether or not one is a geographer, just as the author said in the original preface: "China is now in the midst of unprecedented social, economic, and political adjustments. A great power that has always been isolated and conservative is now quickly reforming its life and becoming a member of the world's nations. Geography cannot claim to be able to solve some of the problems arising from evolution, but it can explain some of the background to this evolution."</p>
<p>The Social Geographical Foundation</p>
<p>This volume, "The Geographical Basis of China," is the general theory part of George Babcock Cressey's geographical works on China, divided into six parts: geographical overview, topography, climate, farmers, natural resources, and world communication, for separate explanations.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at its contents: In the first chapter, "Geographical Landscape," it points out that the most important factor in China's landscape is not soil, plants, or climate, but the people. This point, we can trust, in China's ancient land, it is difficult to find a small place that has not been rendered by human activities. At the same time, the author also points out China's natural isolation. In the past history, China has been surrounded by obstructive barriers, and has not been in contact with other parts of the world, and the exchange of knowledge is also very little. These are the tropical jungles, tall mountains, vast deserts, and distant oceans that jointly maintain China's unity and isolation.</p>
<p>Thomas said in "The Foundations of Social Environment": "It is now generally recognized that the most important factor in cultural progress is the contact of multiple cultures, and stagnation occurs if isolated. A certain environment is sufficient to touch another environment and provide a path, mutually communicating with another area, which will encourage the receptivity of people's minds and the progress of culture; conversely, an isolated environment will inevitably cause mental stagnation and repetition."</p>
<p>From this, we can understand the reasons for the backwardness of Chinese science.</p>
<p>This chapter also describes contrasting places, outlining a comparison table between the South and the North, population pressure; and explaining new and old transportation, listing examples of cars and highways in various places.</p>
<p>The author's conclusion in this chapter, the paragraph "China in Understanding," is inaccurate in several places because the writing era is different. But as a reference, it is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Climate and Farmland</p>
<p>The second chapter, "Topography," explains the geological foundation; China certainly does not have the glacial features of Europe and North America, so the author lists our characteristics. These cannot be introduced one by one here.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding mountains, rivers, alluvial plains, coastal areas, and changes in China's territory, the author uses very sufficient materials to explain; and lists the population and area surveys of various provinces in China for reference.</p>
<p>Climate - the factor that determines human activity, is discussed in the third chapter of this book. It describes the physical nature of China's climate, which is the monsoon operation that is transformed sequentially by topography and ocean relations, occasional tropical cyclones, and a series of continental storms, to produce a climate zone. Climate and human life are also fully elaborated, as well as wind direction illustrations and tables of average temperature and average rainfall.</p>
<p>Chapter Four is about "Farmers for Four Thousand Years." Of course, China has always been known as an agricultural country, and agricultural issues are the most important. In this chapter, the author first explains the morning landscape, then touches on the foundation of agriculture, and the broad expanse of Chinese arable land. He lists and explains the arable land of past dynasties and the arable land of various provinces, and further reports the detailed table of arable land and crop area of each province. There is also a table explaining crop yields.</p>
<p>China's agricultural problems still exist today. The author points out the general importance of China's agricultural problems in the past. The scientification of Chinese fish farming requires social transformation. After the basic knot of the current situation is untied, we can embark on this path.</p>
<p>The issue of natural resources is discussed in Chapter Five. It first discusses the historical background; the source of coal and the world's coal reserves, extending to the most important power - coal mining. Then, the estimated coal reserves and the coal production of various mines are listed and explained separately.</p>
<p>Regarding other power sources, such as oil, iron, and other metallic and non-metallic substances, explanations are also accompanied by tables; finally, the production of Chinese minerals and the prospects of Chinese industry are discussed.</p>
<p>Looking Forward to China's Trade</p>
<p>The last chapter is "China's Interaction with the World." The author describes its historical background. China's earliest westward expeditions and trade began during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. By the nineteenth century, export trade gradually increased, and it is listed to explain the goods directly exported to foreign countries and the comparison of foreign trade commodities.</p>
<p>Weaving trade is certainly far greater than export trade. This is after the Opium War, international capitalism opened up China's independent and autonomous gate, creating the sub-colonial status mentioned by Sun Yat-sen. The author of this book also points out: "For many years, tangible imports have greatly exceeded the value of exports. This so-called unfavorable trade balance has become increasingly harmful in recent years."</p>
<p>Finally, it explains China's trading ports and the foreign trade of various ports. At this point, the book comes to an end.</p>
<p>After reading this book, one has a basic understanding of China's geography. Therefore, this book can be used as a basic understanding for young people in study.</p>

<h3>Rereading "Fathers and Sons"</h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>By Ivan Turgenev, Translated by Ba Jin</p>
<p>Published by Cultural Life Press, September of the 35th year of the Republic of China, 365 pages</p>
<p>In the field of literature and art, French romantic literature, with its gorgeous writing style, has attracted a wide range of readers. From this, we think of Turgenev, a famous writer. His novels and prose poems have intoxicated countless young people. Turgenev himself was Russian and of aristocratic descent. However, he studied in France, so his works could not escape the color of French romanticism.</p>
<p>Turgenev's works mostly take the resistance of young people against the old forces in the era of the Russian Tsarist regime as the theme. However, he only describes it from the side, using his skillful writing and the soul of "nihilism" to depict those immortal figures in literature and art.</p>
<p>The novel "Fathers and Sons" depicts the conflict between new and old ideas in the era of the liberation of Russian serfs, using his beautiful style and developing it through the prism of his view of life.</p>
<p>The content of this novel is roughly about:</p>
<p>A progressive landlord, a descendant of the Russian aristocracy—Nikolai, and his son—Arkady, who is returning home from the University of St. Petersburg, this pair of father and son are the central figures. The author develops a magnificent masterpiece from the personalities of the two of them.</p>
<p>Arkady is a hollow believer in nihilism, and the one who gave him this belief is his classmate Bazarov; this time he came home with Bazarov as a companion. Therefore, he criticizes all of his old father Nikolai's actions with his nihilistic eyes, which sometimes makes his old father feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Nikolai has an older brother, Pavel, who is a complete maintainer of aristocratic dignity, a stubborn old man, so Bazarov often argues with him.</p>
<p>After many days, two like-minded nihilists met a beautiful lady, Anna, at a welcome party; consequently, they unknowingly fell into the city of love, and all their actions and deeds in front of Anna seemed to be somewhat different from the past.</p>
<p>After the two nihilists entered Anna's manor together, Bazarov gained victory. Arkady, however, was also very enthusiastic about Anna's sister, Katya.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them felt that it was not worth spending time only in the horn of love. So they broke away from the entanglement of love and went to live in Bazarov's home at the same time. Bazarov's father was an enlightened small serf. After they arrived there, the shackles of love did not break away from them; Arkady ran to Anna's manor on the pretext, while Bazarov thought of Nikolai's beloved concubine, Feni, and went to Nikolai's home, and got the opportunity to kiss Feni twice.</p>
<p>This secret was known by Nikolai's stubborn brother Pavel, who was furious and agreed to a duel with Bazarov. In the end of the duel, the stubborn old man was injured. Because of this lesson, the old man changed his previous stubbornness and compromised with the new trend.</p>
<p>Bazarov could no longer live in Nikolai's home; after he left, he ran to Anna's place to tell Arkady about this, and also met Anna, and finally returned to his father's manor.</p>
<p>Here, Nikolai, due to the persuasion of his changed brother, broke the concept of class and officially held a wedding with Feni. Arkady also succeeded in love with Anna's sister, and married on the same day as his father.</p>
<p>Fathers and sons combined two pairs of newlyweds on the same auspicious day; afterwards, the father and son jointly operated agriculture and did very well; the families were also very harmonious. In that beautiful and happy environment, they lived a sweet life.</p>
<p>What about Bazarov? After he returned home, he worked as a doctor for the farmers, but one time he was careless in dissecting and contracted a terrible disease, ending his life.</p>
<p>Bazarov's parents often mourned and wept before their son's spirit.</p>
<p>This masterpiece ends here on its last page.</p>
<p>After reading this work, it is very clear that it uses the ups and downs of love as a clue, fully expressing the atmosphere of romanticism and its unreality. In the entanglement of love, various thoughts are silent.</p>
<p>Bazarov, originally a forward-thinking person, encounters obstacles and suffers everywhere here. As a result, he destroyed himself.</p>
<p>Arkady, although a worshiper of Bazarov, was not as unruly; he was loved by his father and uncle, and as a result also became a follower of his career.</p>
<p>What about Nikolai? His progressive thinking cooperated with his son and entered a pink and happy family; his brother also reformed a stubborn aristocratic self-esteem and achieved compromise.</p>
<p>This work cannot be denied to have its skillful beauty in terms of literary depiction. The conclusion is also called perfect. Only in terms of consciousness, as mentioned earlier, it cannot match the facts and is full of philistine ways.</p>
<p>It writes a forward-thinking young man with a satirical pen as destroying himself, while on the aristocratic side, the author is sympathetic. Pavel's compromise and the sweet life of Nikolai and his son are the opposite of Bazarov.</p>
<p>The writing style of this work is worth learning, because this work is a very good masterpiece as a common work of art. The translator Ba Jin translated it based on the English version, and the translation is fairly smooth, but it may not be completely consistent with the original text. In short, this is a beautifully depicted work of art!</p>
<h3>Concerning the Soviets</h3>
<p>— Jiuzhang</p>
<p>A. WHITE: A REPORT ON THE RUSSIANS</p>
<p>The author of this book, Mr. White, visited the Soviet Union in the summer of 1944 when the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union was extremely harmonious. He was "specially permitted" to "see what he wanted to see and write what he wanted to write after returning home." He visited the Maral industrial area in the Soviet hinterland, a place that no foreigner had been to since the beginning of the Five-Year Plan in 1926. He entered the newly recovered rural areas of Ukraine, talking to farmers, hoping to hear their true inner thoughts. Of course, there were also one or two times when the iron fist of ideological control prevented Mr. White from visiting freely. They visited a factory in Siberia, where he had a very pleasant conversation with a German-speaking female worker. However, as soon as White turned around, a secret police officer (NKVD, formerly GPU) questioned her. From then on, she only responded with reluctant agreement or silence. "In the Soviet Union, where can anyone freely talk to foreigners?" But, on the whole, Mr. White's group's visit was quite free. Especially during his debate with a female translator in Moscow, he frankly stated where he thought the Soviet Union was inferior to the United States; the frankness was probably surprising to the reader.</p>
<p>What I personally am particularly interested in is what is the life of the average Soviet person actually like? The author of this book happens to have this point of view: he does not vaguely discuss Soviet policies, but often wants to know the daily expenses of a worker. The standard of living of ordinary people is an achievement of governance and cannot be considered a military secret. Treating such information as a military secret, thereby arousing suspicion, is always an unwise move.</p>
<p>In the third chapter, the author describes his visit to three Moscow factories: an aircraft factory, an automobile factory, and a biscuit factory. In the first factory, he inquired about working hours and wages. The working hours of ordinary workers are sixty-six hours per week, and the income is one thousand rubles. Eating a meal in the factory cafeteria costs five rubles a day, which is very cheap. But what can you buy with the remaining eight hundred or more rubles per month? In the "store," ham costs more than one thousand rubles per pound, and chicken costs around five hundred rubles per pound. Clothing is even more expensive. Therefore, this worker can fill his stomach by eating in the factory cafeteria and pass a few evenings by going to the designated theater, but "once he leaves the factory, his food and clothing immediately become a problem." He cannot save money like an American. Mr. White said, "The factory is theoretically owned by the workers, but in reality, the workers belong to the factory."</p>
<p>In the second factory, Mr. White asked the "manager" what happens if workers are lazy at work. "First, a warning is posted on the wall newspaper, and then a speech is given at the trade union." Mr. White immediately understood! The trade union has become an organization to restrain workers. Another time (Chapter 8), White asked a trade union leader, if a worker is dissatisfied with his current job, can he go somewhere else? The answer was, "He must apply to the factory." "If he leaves without permission, can he find work elsewhere?" The answer was, "No, he will have a very hard time finding work anywhere in the Soviet Union." Mr. White also asked, "Isn't this equivalent to a blacklist?" The answer was, "It can't be considered a blacklist." The "freedom" in the American mind cannot be found in the Soviet dictionary. As for the author's comparison of the lives of Soviet workers to the lives of American prisoners in Chapter 4, perhaps it is a bit too indignant. By analogy, "the treatment of workers throughout the Soviet Union is almost the same, because all factories belong to the government, and the treatment is all stipulated by the government." Some Chinese readers may agree with this approach, but Americans generally cannot accept it.</p>
<p>"In the Soviet Union, the lives of employed workers are not as good as the lives of workers receiving unemployment benefits during the economic panic in the United States." It is difficult to say how reliable this statement is. But the words of the Soviet female translator in the book can only be regarded as "self-deprecating." She said, "I am very miserable myself, but I know that everyone else is miserable, and I am comforted." Everyone with common sense knows that the slogan of socialism is to realize "everyone's paradise," not everyone being equally poor. There will always be a gap between the slogan and the reality. An ideal will always change somewhat when it is put into practice. This was the case before and after the French Revolution, and it is also true of the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>The author has not studied the economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union. He can only briefly talk about the shortcomings of the Soviet Union as perceived by Mr. White. (1) It is very difficult for the Soviet government to plan and guide the activities and development of factories across the country from one center (the Kremlin). The "managers" or responsible persons of each factory tend to be perfunctory and lack initiative, and some technical and management talents are sometimes purged due to political lines. (2) The elimination of the profit motive reduces competition, and people generally do not want to improve production methods. According to Mr. White, the American system has a greater incentive for new inventions than the Soviet system. The Stakhanovite movement was actually secretly restoring competition, but the encouragement of "medals" is not as good as actual benefits. "Generally speaking, capitalism invents, and socialism imitates." This is White's view.</p>
<p>However, what is read in the book, that is, what the author saw, is that the Soviet Union also has many advantages. For example, the standard of living of Soviet people is lower than that of Americans, but there are no beggars. During wartime, resources are always first used by frontline soldiers. As well as the Soviet government's handling of issues among ethnic minorities, etc. The author has never denied this.</p>
<p>Books such as "Impressions" or "Memoirs" have become an important category in British and American books. The writing is fluent, like a novel; the observations are unique, enough for experts to pick from. This book is also like this. But our post-war publishing industry rarely sees this type of book for the time being.</p>

<h3>Introducing [Meng Jiangnv]</h3>
<p>— Wang Bosheng</p>
<p>As early as twenty-one years ago, while engaged in research and improvement work on inherent and modern theater arts in Beiping, I happened to see the premiere performance of Mr. Afu Xialomufu's opera at the Zhenguang Cinema. Twelve years ago, at the Shandong Provincial Theater, I had been involved in the pilot performance of the opera "Yue Fei." Not long ago, at the National Opera School, along with Zheng Zhisheng, Lin Gangbai, Chen Tianhe, Zhu Chongzhi, and many friends in the music and dance circles, I also engaged in the experimental performance of the operas "Jing Ke," "Xuan Zheng Gong," and "Song of China." Today, the "Meng Jiangnv" by Afu Xialomufu and Chen Zhong and others has also been staged in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Some of the performers this time are former colleagues and classmates. They all told me that this time the approach is the same as our previous experiments, both in theory and in the application of techniques. Therefore, I have watched it twice and will give a solemn introduction and explanation of its constituent principles and its influence on political philosophy and art philosophy.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Why should we introduce this type of art? From the perspective of political philosophy, since the Three Dynasties, China has been influenced by feudal ideas, and the realm of national thought has gradually had invisible constraints. As a result, society has become increasingly rational, and a certain attitude and belief have been created in the minds of the vast society and the people. Therefore, the culture itself has entered a stage of stagnation for two thousand years. This invisibly morbid society, in the past hundred years, has felt the pressure from the international community in various economic aspects. As a result of rationalization, it has become increasingly impoverished, thus naturally forming selfishness, infighting, and fragmentation, causing society to fall into a state of collapse, fragmentation, and disunity. This is one of the reasons why Sun Yat-sen engaged in revolutionary work. After the revolution, followed by a difficult war of resistance, it has finally been completed. In terms of political and other improvements before and after the war, all staff members who were aware of the overall situation have done their best under the daily supervision of the leader. However, they still cannot reverse the declining trends of society. There are other reasons for this.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, the way to revitalization in the future is science and art. The importance of science is well known, but the importance of art, which outweighs science, is not easily understood by the general public. For example, take the industrial products of natural science. The more truthful the natural laws found in the universe are, the greater the power and the more contributions to mankind. However, no matter whether it is an atomic bomb or an airplane, its properties and power are ultimately limited. After all, it is mankind that controls and shakes the universe. The reason is that mankind has a subtle soul. Therefore, in ancient times, when governing a country, people's spiritual life and the human body, the so-called dwelling place of the soul, were nourished in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. (Rites) were used as the basis for their political measures. Therefore, their political philosophy is: rites regulate people's hearts, music harmonizes people's voices, politics is implemented, and punishment is used to prevent. Rites, music, punishment, and politics reach all directions without contradiction, then the kingly way is fully prepared. From this, we know that punishment and politics are inevitable measures, and rites and music are essential components of life. (Rites are nourishment and should be viewed as the regulation of time and space art. As for human affairs, it is merely the measure between people. Please refer to Sima Qian's "Treatise on Rites and Music" in the "Records of the Grand Historian".)</p>
<p>Natural science has reached such a complex stage, so the art of cultivating people's minds must also make parallel progress with the functions of natural science to produce balanced effects. For example, ancient sedan chairs, no matter how good they are, no one rides in them anymore, because their functions are too far from those of airplanes and trains. Therefore, some of the functions of ancient rites and music should be replaced by musical dramas, because music must enter the drama to stimulate people's hearts and respond to people's rhythms. We really cannot think that it is just a kind of decoration for life because there is a word "drama." Because opera is a powerful organism, the use of lines and colors is the creation of visual science in the human spirit, and rhythm and melody are the creation of auditory science in the human soul. All progressive art is the science of cultivating the soul. Only with good cultivation of the soul can heat occur between people, can people's minds become broad, can they have resilience and compassion, can society become active and have new vitality. Therefore, any country with scientific development in Europe and America must also be a country with developed art, because society is peaceful and science has a foundation. If the spirit does not enter the right track, society cannot hope for peace and order. There are mutual effects. This is one of the reasons why this art career should be valued.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the art philosophy of the times, Chinese society has fallen into a stage of rational poverty. If art is engaged in provocation or giving divergent hints, the people who are directly harmed are the masses. In response to the historical fact that the past feudal society has given us society too much manifestation of intelligence, it seems that we cannot but seek something in the creation of emotional art. Because society cannot be improved by simply destroying it, nor can it be effective by simply whipping it.</p>
<p>Next, I want to say a few words from the point of view of creation, because this is necessary for the analysis of the play "Meng Jiangnv." Every great art is a beautiful realm in itself, with an inviolable style. Only with this style can it influence people. A beautiful realm must have its constituent elements. In terms of music, because there is rhythm, it can transcend reality. Because it transcends reality, people can forget its ugliness. A beautiful realm and a great style, in terms of opera, its success often does not belong to the success of one kind of expression medium, because it must be a balanced development of various expression media to produce an organic organization of spiritual and physical harmony. But there are exceptions sometimes. If a certain expression medium has its unique beauty, it can also gradually induce other expression media to coordinate with it, and gradually form a complete organization. For example, the human soul is innate, and the coordination of its clothing and actions is governed by the soul. Although a kind of decoration sometimes makes it difficult for people to distinguish between truth and falsehood, it is indeed not an easy task for an opera artist to grasp the method of opening up and completing affairs. The merit and blame of Meng Jiangnv's music and dance lie in the fact that there is a considerable foundation for the application of this kind of coordination.</p>
<p>What is the independent style of Chinese music? This is the first question to be studied. China is a society of ethics and morality, so in music, emotions are not created by music, but ethics is created by medicine. In terms of the composition of ethics and morality, all arts in its society have their own independent forms based on this. There is a beginning, a middle, and an end. Most of them are expressions of transcendence of reality, peace, and personality. Its value is not so much focused on emotion as it is on personality. For example, bells are used to establish martial arts, bamboo is used to establish meetings, drums are used to establish movement, and chimes are used to establish discrimination. The reason why we cherish our percussion instruments lies only in this. In terms of the times, the weakness of Chinese music has been completely swallowed up by the torrent of its times. Mr. Afu Xialomufu picked up things that had been forgotten for a long time and gave them rich emotions and the power of the times, making a unique Chinese language (music is the language of the world) become the language of the world. This is indeed something worth cherishing. The chapters of Meng Jiangnv's music could be strengthened to create its main melody so that its character would be more powerful or even more distinctive.</p>
<p>Regarding actions, I believe that in the eyes of artists, there is no distinction between new, old, superior, or inferior for all of his expressive mediums, because most new things come from changes in the old. What artists need to consider carefully is the balance of power, the harmony of colors, the distance of scales, and the speed of rhythms. In terms of action, rhythm and lines are the expressive mediums of its power. This rhythm can achieve a consistent harmony with music, installations, drama texts, and other related aspects, and it must be successful. Chinese inherent drama and Indian drama have many similarities. The main thing is action. Gan Geoli exchanged opinions with Zhongnong two years ago. He deeply admired the use of action to represent words in Chinese drama. I believe that in drama, it is necessary to further develop what we already have, because in art, it is still a new inspiration. In the performance of "Yue Fei" in the past, I made expressions of coordination and non-coordination in action, and made a balanced development with the harmony of music. Sometimes its function exceeded that of music, because action is, after all, much more distinct than music. Chen Zhong, who actually performed the directing task of "Meng Jiangnv," has spent a lot of effort, which can be seen. I still hope that they will work harder so that the guest and host are distinct, there is a climax, the changes in the patterns can be increased again, and the use of movement and stillness can be more appropriate to strengthen the creation of its character. Then, a new harmonious introduction to inherent art can be established in the modern theater world.</p>
<p>In terms of installations, its style is generally quite harmonious, but the center of gravity of each painting should still be strengthened so that all sublimating effects transcend reality and have a basis.</p>
<p>In terms of costumes, it is also quite gorgeous, and no major problems can be seen. If we can not stick to historical facts and add more expression of character or make it more vivid in the lines and colors based on historical facts.</p>
<p>In terms of drama texts, the dialogue of the whole play should be changed to poetry. Its punctuation does not need to follow the inherent yin, yang, ping, qu, and ru tones (as in the old dramas), but should be created in terms of light and heavy speaking based on emotion. As for the structure of the whole play, the climax of each act and the climax of the whole play should be strengthened to make it a three-dimensional form to accommodate all the techniques.</p>
<p>I think all problems are easy to change now that she has established a commendable scale because these are all minor problems.</p>
<p>From a political point of view and from the point of view of art philosophy, it must be said that the performance of "Meng Jiangnv" is a work that is most worthy of cherishing. Because under the same principles, our ancient great epics and all cultural and artistic traces can be used as an opportunity to further express ourselves to people at home and abroad. Although this kind of creation is not something we cannot grasp ourselves, the revision of musical art is, after all, a task for a genius and requires long-term efforts. Afu Xialomufu has been in China for thirty years. He is welcome to work for the cause of art. Handel was a German who lived in England and became famous. His Messiah oratorio, because of the reverence of the King of England, became a beautiful story in the world. Chopin was a Pole who also lived in France and became famous because art is the common property of mankind. As for the plot of the drama, it can be seen that Qin Shihuang was selfish and did not care about the hunger of the people. He only wanted to achieve the desire of one family for a long-lasting foundation. He made this brutal and inhumane act that violated the public by destroying everything of the people and sacrificing it for one person and one surname to build the Great Wall, then Wan Xiliang and Meng Jiangnv were just representatives of the whole people. The sufferers were all families like this. If we face reality, then after this war, when the people of the world are suffering, all countries are suffering from using all their strength to expand their armaments again, then this play cannot but be said to be a most meaningful contribution to saving peace and saving the world, because the most precious thing about it is that it influences people with the style of art.</p>
<h3>Goethe's Quotations</h3>
<p>— Wanshi</p>
<p>Nature is always true and serious; it is never mistaken. The incompetent cannot see nature, but those who are educated, pursue truth, and are pure in heart can see the mysteries of nature. Nature is constantly moving. It curses all lazy behavior.</p>
<p>It is easier to see mistakes than truth, because mistakes are on the outside. So it is easy to see, but truth is at the bottom. Most people are unwilling to look for it.</p>
<h3>Nude Woman</h3>
<p>— Dai Lakewa</p>
<p>Dai Lakewa (E. Deracroin 1798-1864) was a traitor among the students of the early French classical writer David. Not only did he not inherit from his teacher, but he also established the Romantic school, causing a great revolution in the art world and enlightening later generations to establish painting theories. His style is novel, the colors are complex, and the subjects are mostly legends, myths, and history. "Dante's Boat Crossing" is one of his representative works. This nude woman was modeled after a maid in the court at that time. The brushstrokes are simple and solid (Lion).</p>
<h3>Fiddler</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>Yan Dong Hutong is in the West City of Beiping. Even the most detailed map does not list its name. In this secluded neighborhood, besides a few jujube trees at the corner of the wall, in the summer season, you only hear the calls of those selling fruits—the rhythmic clanging of copper coins. On winter nights, Muslims chanted with a long voice: "Aluo sheep moon..."</p>
<p>At the western end of the alley is the city wall. The mule cart road is always so gray, deep and thick; crows gather in flocks on the power lines, among the weeds on the city wall. Only the fish-white sky is a suitable sight in the line of sight.</p>
<p>Especially in autumn, I developed a love of change for this environment. I often carried a lacquered cane that was convenient for use as a self-defense weapon and strolled to the vicinity of the city wall. It was strange that I didn't know why I was interested in visiting such a gray scene.</p>
<p>One day after Mid-Autumn Festival, I followed the old road and walked to the city wall, planning to go a little further north to find the stone steps that could be used to climb the city for sightseeing. I met a short, fat man in a blue cloth gown. His head, like a steamed bun, was shaved very clean. His right hand was holding a few pieces of tofu held by a lotus leaf, and his left hand was carrying a bottle of sesame oil. He smiled at me and said:</p>
<p>"Sixth Master, you are really funny. Why are you wandering around here?"</p>
<p>I looked at him for a while.</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten me?" he said, putting on an imposing look and choking on phlegm. "Haven't you heard what Qu Ziqiu of Hua District plays? I live diagonally across from your master's house."</p>
<p>Oh, that's right, his surname is Qi, a fiddler. Every evening, the secluded erhu sound that came from the opposite courtyard was transmitted from his hand to my ears. Due to the feeling for art, I couldn't help but change my stubborn state, with some nostalgic expression, said:</p>
<p>"It's you! How could I not know. Your skills, not only now, I have appreciated a lot since I was a child. How are you now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't mention it. Now, now, now it's nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing? Aren't you playing the erhu in the theater?"</p>
<p>"I haven't done that job for two years."</p>
<p>Old Qi's eyes were a little gloomy, like a cloud covering his mood. Indeed, I have also heard people say that this year, he had only been invited to one cold place—the Binyan Hualou, by a few amateur opera performers. His previous glory had disappeared. He became a violinist of those "trio" on the road. Sometimes, it was difficult to find a partner. Was it because he was old? Or was it because of other reasons that he lost the favor of the old patrons?</p>
<p>"I can't get along, Sixth Master. They're new—they say they're new, and they see us as old. The old patrons also love new things, composing new tunes, going to Harbin, running to Hong Kong, Shanghai. Leaving me here unchanged, one is reluctant to part with the cheap coal noodles in Beiping, and the other is that there is an old mother at home. I just fell down like this, isn't that right?"</p>
<p>"You are too humble, opening a class and recruiting students."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about! It's easy to say, but it's not easy..."</p>
<p>Old Qi seemed to suddenly have an unpleasant thought. He held the tofu and walked past me, saying at the end:</p>
<p>"See you tomorrow!"</p>
<p>This time I left Beiping in 1933 to find a few friends to do a small thing. Who knew that four years later, I would still return to my secluded old residence. I still live in the front yard—the room with two jujube trees next to the window. I started doing some editing work—extracting the main ideas from the original text and writing a booklet about the main trends of modern criticism.</p>
<p>I hope to regain my early inspiration in that light corner and write prose poems. But I can't hear that elegant erhu sound anymore. In the past, this erhu sound always made me feel nostalgic, dreamy, and sleepless, but now it is silent, and I can't help but guess—oh, Old Qi, you are silent... you have not abandoned art, or did you move?</p>
<p>The servant Lao Tian told me when he was asked once:</p>
<p>"Old Qi is in jail, and hasn't come out yet. The year before last, he opened a small grocery store and lost hundreds of dollars; he returned to his hometown to sell land, and got into a lawsuit. He lost the lawsuit and was given... alas, what a pity, that good Xipi skill!"</p>
<p>Writer Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Voltaire</h3>
<p>— Gan Si</p>
<p>In 1771, when the great French writer Voltaire arrived in England, he discovered that the English people intensely hated the French. Therefore, walking on the streets of London was a dangerous activity for his life. One day, as he was strolling, a group of angry Englishmen shouted, "Kill him, hang this Frenchman!"</p>
<p>Voltaire stood firm, facing them, and loudly said, "Gentlemen of England! You want to kill me because I am French! But I am unfortunate and cannot be English. Isn't this punishment severe enough?"</p>
<p>The crowd, upon hearing this, couldn't help but cheer and safely escorted Voltaire back to his own residence.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 120</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Why did Tsurumi come to Matsushima? It's obvious that his plan has failed. He thought he could use the Black Dragon Society to passively reduce hindering forces and perhaps actively obtain more accurate information to explore the secrets of the "Seven Sealed Letters." Who knew that the Black Dragon Society would give him a Pingzi, a rather formidable opponent; moreover, judging from the past dozen hours, it seems like he is still a love demon, a persistent entanglement that is not easy to escape.</p>
<p>From the Konoe residence, he saw that Konoe, this merit-hungry and bloodthirsty demon, was not as easy to deal with as he had imagined. Besides, he originally knew that the Fifth Column was quite formidable, but he never dreamed that there would be such vigilant and agile figures among them. There was also that Elder Aoki, simply an incredible magician, who could grasp metaphysical power and manipulate people's psychology. He still doesn't know what their views are on this invasion war, but if they happen to support annexing the entire Asia and want to be world overlords, thinking like those demons, then this kind of magic group is also a huge obstacle. In other words, Tsurumi wanting to use his own strength and that of a few comrades to handle this major event of revealing the "Secret Gears" is equivalent to climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>Furthermore, listening to Pingzi's tone, there are many factions in Tokyo's political, military, and business circles, each with considerable power, and they are making a big deal out of his insignificant participation in the Black Dragon Society. It seems that, even before taking action, his plan is destined to fail. Moreover, his physical exhaustion in the past two days is also a major factor leading him to despair. Therefore, he temporarily put everything down and ran to Matsushima in a puff of smoke. Madam Koyori and Kikuko have the mixed warmth and understanding of a mother, a lover, and a confidante, and the quiet and elegant location and residence are enough to eliminate the bad mood in his heart.</p>
<p>He dozed off for a while, daydreamed for a while, and felt hungry, so he put on his slippers and went downstairs. It was Kikuko who first discovered Tsurumi coming downstairs, as if she had been waiting at the bottom of the stairs. She first gave Tsurumi a casual greeting, asking if he had slept well, and then, with her sweet and crisp voice, called into the half-open room, "Mom, Yu-ge is coming downstairs." Madam Koyori also answered from the kitchen, "Kiku, quickly open the door to the Buddhist hall." Then, the old lady, who was over sixty but didn't look old, rushed out of the kitchen with a kind smile on her face.</p>
<p>Kikuko took the lead, opened the door to the Buddhist hall, and stepped aside to let Tsurumi and her mother enter the hall. This was a small room covered with tatami mats, inside which oil lamps and Zhilan incense were already lit. In the center of the shrine was a Buddha statue, and on the altar below were several frames, each containing an enlarged photograph. One was a posthumous photo of Koyori Keita, Kikuko's father; another was a photo of Meizi, Tsurumi's adoptive mother.</p>
<p>Madam Koyori and Kikuko accompanied Tsurumi to pay respects and pray for blessings in the Buddhist hall, and then they walked together to the living room, where they greeted each other again; there was no nagging or triviality. At this time, Kikuko showed her housekeeping skills, first serving Tsurumi to sit down, and then instructing the maid to serve dishes and warm wine. The place was filled with warmth: Madam Koyori sat near the window, watching Tsurumi drink wine with a smile, and said some polite words that didn't make people feel uncomfortable: "I seemed to have a premonition, I didn't intend to go to the market today, and I didn't intend to buy these foods. I don't know if your taste has changed for the small dried fish you usually like...?"</p>
<p>Kikuko poured wine cup by cup, occasionally interjecting a light and elegant joke, "Yu-ge's taste won't change much; look, his first chopstick is a slice of fish, the second chopstick is also a slice of fish, and the third chopstick is still a slice of fish."</p>
<h3>Presented to Dr. Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chengbo</p>
<p>Four Seven-Character Quatrains with a Preface</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang is good at music, singing, and dancing, and is a leader of the opera world of our time. During the war, he was trapped in enemy territory and could not escape, so he grew a beard and refused to perform; his determination to destroy his appearance and swallow charcoal, vowing to serve the country, was not much different from that of Tang musician Lei Haiqing. After the victory, he performed The Imperial Concubine Assassinates the Tiger in Shanghai, and a ticket cost ten thousand gold, with people rubbing shoulders as if going to the market. The drama was perfect, and its appeal was appropriate! The mirror reflects the faithfulness of Zhang Shengmin and the integrity of a martyr; the empty flute case shows even more the ambition to care for one's homeland. I wrote four seven-character quatrains to praise him.</p>
<p>It is when the soldiers break through the enemy, that the song and dance of Neon Clothes remind one of before the lanterns; the Peking Opera circle has its own sad stories, and Mei Lanfang has been trapped for ten years.</p>
<p>Ghost fires burn autumn graves, mounds of earth stretch for ten thousand; the rise and fall are like a dream, the water flows long; don't say that no one gets old in war, the doctor is now white-haired.</p>
<p>Red powder and blue shirt express patriotism, a turtledove's appearance and a swan's face show shame at stealing life; the talented person has passed away, and the tortoise year is old, who else recognizes the name?</p>
<p>Ten years of desolation in the song of the brothel, today the smiling voices in the tower are harmonious; I beg the Lang not to grow old easily, the Central Plains is still the land of the Han.</p>

<h3>Lament for the Shantytowns</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Policies must be implemented, and we wholeheartedly support them. The authorities have a practical spirit and a wise plan, they want to do things and are willing to do things, and we also admire them very much; and we can understand and sympathize with all the difficulties and obstacles encountered in the implementation of policies. However, regarding the demolition of shantytowns, we would like to suggest getting through this harsh winter and holding it again next spring, that is, postponing the implementation for two months. I wonder if this humble opinion can be heard?</p>
<p>For the safety of four million people, sacrifice forty thousand shantytowns, even if it is not to such an exact degree, but the construction of the urban area has its own overall plan, and besides, these forty thousand shantytowns are by no means a sacrifice, just asking them to move to non-restricted construction areas. So in principle, we absolutely support it, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Why do we ask to postpone the implementation for two months? That is really for the sake of humanity. This year, all industries have felt depressed, and the middle and lower classes have felt the economic pressure. Adding to the severe cold, the end of winter, demolition and construction, and large-scale construction will not only increase the financial burden, but also make people feel embarrassed in terms of manpower. If you and I are one of these forty thousand households, in this desolate and declining year, what kind of sad shadow will you and I's emotions be covered with!</p>
<p>Human touch! We'd better take care of it a little bit!</p>
<p>Of course, we know very well the seriousness of the authorities' handling of this matter, and we also know that the shantytown residents will definitely obey the orders and follow the regulations, and there will be no problems. Maybe we are too emotional, but if we let these shantytowns live through this harsh winter, wouldn't it be more humane?</p>
<p>It's just a woman's kindness!</p>
<h3>Ten Years Ago Today in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Xiaomai</p>
<p>…Remembering an important day in history…</p>
<p>Ten years ago today, Chairman Chiang was in distress in Xi'an. It took thirteen days for him to escape danger and return to Nanjing. Before leaving Shaanxi, Chairman Chiang gave instructions to Zhang and Yang, saying, "This resolution of the Xi'an Incident is related to the survival of China's fifty-year history and the survival of the Republic of China." Ten years of history have proved that these two "prophetic" comments are not exaggerated.</p>
<p>When the "Double Twelfth" Incident occurred, the author was staying in Tokyo. The situation at that time is still vaguely remembered.</p>
<p>According to historical records, the "Double Twelfth Incident" occurred at 5 a.m. before dawn that day. That morning, the Xi'an Telegraph Bureau was already under surveillance by the defense forces, so the news could not be transmitted. The first extra edition in Tokyo, I remember, was published before the regular evening newspaper, which seemed to have been sent from Nanjing. As far as I know afterwards, many of the telegrams from the newspapers at that time and later were deleted by the Japanese authorities, so what was left was too short to be shortened. After the evening newspaper at about 5 p.m., there was also an extra edition from a certain newspaper.</p>
<p>The Enemy Rejoices</p>
<p>From then until Chiang's escape from danger and return to Nanjing on "December 25," the reporters stationed in China by major newspapers in Tokyo were ordered by the head office to compete for reports. Even the city's field reporters desperately interviewed external reactions. At that time, the Chinese Embassy in Japan and Ambassador Xu Shiying in Azabu District were naturally the first targets, but Xu kept his mouth shut and the reporters gained nothing. As far as I know afterwards, the information successively received by the "Kasumigaseki" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and "Miyakesaka" (Ministry of the Army) in Tokyo, Japan, was comparable to that of the embassy!</p>
<p>When the city's field reporters had nothing to write or record, the "Yomiuri Shimbun," which had risen in Tokyo and engaged in a "battle for supremacy" with the two major overlords, "Asahi" and "Mainichi," actually interviewed the dormitory of students studying in Japan. A certain student studying in Tokyo replied, "What we know is as much as what is recorded in the newspapers." This sentence (a bit like "diplomatic language," but it is indeed the truth) was unexpectedly published on the front page of the city news, and several photos were inserted.</p>
<p>From the evening of the 12th, I clearly remember that Tokyo's teahouses, small restaurants, and bathhouses all took this as a topic and as the center of conversation.</p>
<p>The main Japanese military and political figures were naturally very "concerned" about the situation at that time. The author happened to take a "metered car" on a matter of business late on the 13th, passing near the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs! I saw that they were still brightly lit, which was different from usual. It was not until the morning of the 14th that I read the newspaper that I knew that the main Japanese figures had held a long meeting there for four or five hours, discussing the so-called "countermeasures," whose consistent motive was to "see if they could fish in troubled waters and take advantage of the situation."</p>
<p>The next day, the leaders of the Japanese army and navy also held a joint meeting, deciding on the following two so-called "principles": (1) Take self-defense measures when necessary; (2) Be vigilant and observe quietly. Isn't this a "fishing" measure? At that time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs was Arita, the Minister of the Army was Terauchi, and the Minister of the Navy was Nagano.</p>
<p>After the incident, Ambassador Xu's first official contact with the Japanese authorities was the day after Chiang Ting-wen returned to Luoyang from Shaanxi on the 18th. This conversation lasted for more than fifty minutes. At that time, Foreign Minister Arita even shamelessly requested, "I hope to obtain some special news about the Xi'an Incident in a private capacity."</p>
<p>The Japanese ambassador to China at that time was Kawagoe, but he had left Beijing and lived in Shanghai as early as December 5 because the Sino-Japanese negotiations had come to an end. It was not until the 19th that he returned to Beijing from Shanghai under the instruction of the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs." However, regardless of whether Kawagoe was in Beijing or Shanghai, the Tokyo side obtained the information in the same quick and detailed way during these thirteen days.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the views expressed by the head of the agency, Doihara, were clear and blunt: "Japan really should quickly re-examine China."</p>
<p>Disappointed</p>
<p>No matter how beautiful the diplomatic rhetoric is, and no matter how slippery the newspaper editorials are, it cannot be denied that the Japanese warlords wanted to take advantage of the situation at that time. The author still remembers that after "Double Twelfth," the sharp decline in the Tokyo stock market, cotton cloth transactions, and rayon prices can prove what the Japanese people were imagining in their hearts. Isn't this thinking of expanding the conflict between the two sides and causing a major war on the "wishful thinking"?</p>
<p>On the evening of December 25, Tokyo newspapers also issued extra editions, and many of them included photos of Chiang. That night was supposed to be a night of celebration, but on this night, many financial and military leaders were greatly disappointed. Because: what they had hoped for had been shattered. Only some people in the stock market made a fortune.</p>
<p>On that night, many students studying abroad did celebrate wildly, and some almost stayed up all night. But it is doubtful what they were celebrating for. On that night, how many people knew that the Sino-Japanese War, which would begin seven months later, had already planted the fuse and the seeds of victory nine years later?</p>
<h3>Learn from the Children!</h3>
<h3>12 and 13</h3>
<p>— Momo</p>
<p>Some people believe that "thirteen" is the most unlucky number, because at the Last Supper of Jesus, including Judas who killed Jesus, there were exactly thirteen people at the table.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people say: The reason why the "Xi'an Incident" was able to be resolved peacefully that year was because the incident occurred on the "twelfth" and not the "thirteenth."</p>
<p>But he forgot that the number of days from the incident to the rescue to the escape of General Chiang, that is, from the twelfth to the twenty-fifth, was exactly thirteen days!</p>
<p>Some people also say this: On the evening of the eleventh, Shao Yuan-chong, Yang Hu-cheng, Chen Cheng... and others ate at a table of thirteen people in Xi'an. Therefore, Shao suffered an accident at dawn on the twelfth.</p>
<p>And Zhang Xueliang "Young Marshal" did not attend the banquet that night, didn't he later receive a pardon?</p>
<p>Shao Yuan-chong stayed in room 113 of the "Xijing Guest House" in Xi'an that night. The place of martyrdom was again "thirteen"!</p>
<p>Only Mr. Enders flew to Shaanxi on the thirteenth to mediate, and this "thirteen" was a good omen.</p>
<p>And today, the "Guest House" has changed this room stained with historical bloodstains to room 130.</p>
<p>But the Arabic numerals are still written as "thirteen", but there is a "zero" after "thirteen", indicating that the戾气has disappeared!</p>
<p>[12], Eventful Day</p>
<p>In terms of months, May is the month with the most anniversaries of the year. But in terms of day order, the "twelfth day" of each month seems to be an "eventful day."</p>
<p>Today's twelfth is one example. Ten years ago, today, the twelfth, some people made a big mess, almost causing a big trouble.</p>
<p>According to the author's knowledge, other months with the twelfth as a holiday include:</p>
<p>February 12th, North-South Unification Anniversary</p>
<p>March 12th, Anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>April 12th, Anniversary of the Qing Party in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>November 12th, Anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>December 12th, Xi'an Incident Anniversary.</p>
<p>Also, Chairman Chiang escaped from Xi'an and returned to Nanjing on December 25th, which is both the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the world-wide "Christmas". (Ink)</p>
<h3>Women First?</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhong</p>
<p>Our country has always valued men over women. Most parents think of their daughters as "other people's" people. Once they are married, they are even more "unwanted goods", so-called "daughters who are married off are like water that is poured out." Although we can exceptionally see records of valuing women in old books, it is after all an exception. Fortunately, in recent years, the idea of equal rights for men and women has been highly praised, and society has taken notice of women and looked at them with new eyes. Especially in cities, women are the most glamorous, and snobbish parents value women even more. Daughters are their cash cows, and sons are the ones who are useless!</p>
<p>In the "upper class" society of Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners live together, we often hear the slogan "Women First" - Ladies First - is it an international saying since it is translated in both Chinese and English? Therefore, many people believe in it: smoking requires women's permission, you have to take off your hat when you see a woman, and women get priority getting on and off the bus, entering and exiting the room. Even in some universities, female students are first, sitting in the first row in the lecture hall, which has become an immutable habit.</p>
<p>The National Assembly Representatives did not set up separate young and old representatives based on age, but there are women representatives as a separate group. Are women not worthy of being social elites and party representatives...? Are women representatives only representatives because they are women? It seems that they are also influenced by "women first." Is "women first" an insult to women or respect for women?</p>
<p>The trend of "women first" comes entirely from Europe and the United States. We Chinese are just "copying" it, but we don't know that "women first" is a contradiction in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Let's take English as an example: except for the phrase Ladies and Gentlemen when speaking, where women come first. If you write a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Wang, they always write Mr. and Mrs. Wang and not Mrs. and Mr. Wang, with women in the back, this is the first. In articles, especially Americans often like to use He or She or His or Her, with men always on top and women below, this is the second. As for the word "mankind" in English is Mankind and not Womankind, it can be seen that men are enough to represent humanity, while women are not enough. Calling "people" Human Being instead of Huwoman Being is also the same situation. Language is the main feature representing a nation, and there are so many contradictions in English and American (the birthplace of women first); what about others?</p>
<h3>Very Optimistic</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>A: "I heard that if the next world war breaks out, the war will be decided by bacterial weapons that are even fiercer than atomic bombs!"</p>
<p>B: "Oh! That's great! After the next world war, China will definitely be a strong country in name and in fact!"</p>
<p>A: "How do you figure that?"</p>
<p>B: "Isn't it? China has plenty of bacteria!"</p>
<h3>Allegory</h3>
<p>— Guo Hong</p>
<p>One day, a young and energetic young man suddenly developed a strange disease. His left hand hit his right hand, and his right hand hit his left hand, hitting them until the skin was torn and the flesh was open, but he still hit them harder and harder. The people around shook their heads, puzzled.</p>
<h3>Milk and Biscuits - A Blessing Too Thin to Enjoy</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>The National Assembly Representatives moved the refreshment expenses to relieve the Nanjing refugees, and the relief items included "milk" and "biscuits."</p>
<p>But strangely, the refugees didn't care about "milk and biscuits," but asked for "pancakes and fried dough sticks" - is it that milk and biscuits are not as "nutritious" as pancakes and fried dough sticks? It also makes people a little confused!</p>
<p>Logically, beggars can't be choosers, so how can there be a reason to not want biscuits but to want pancakes? Guessing, I'm afraid it's a question of whether you can get full. Although milk and biscuits have lovely names, the amount each person gets may not be more substantial than two pancakes and two fried dough sticks!</p>
<h3>Crying for a Blanket</h3>
<p>— Meng Xian</p>
<p>"Where did the blanket go? The old sky still blows the west wind." It has become the sigh of most public educators. But public educators would rather stare with tearful eyes, still hoping that the blanket will come back.</p>
<h3>Wool Blanket Weeping and Crying Out for Injustice</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Please Investigate the Truth Thoroughly</p>
<p>The case of the public educators' arrest of the wool blanket for bringing it to justice has been published in the previous eight issues of this magazine. It really contains injustice that cannot be extended, and the suffering is difficult to declare; the arrest warrant is issued, how terrified! Therefore, I have to plead the following information to public officials and others. I hope you will appreciate it, in order to reveal the sunken injustice - investigate the truth thoroughly, in order to clarify where the responsibility lies!</p>
<p>The wool blanket and the silkworm body have an agreement, and the price is based; the original plan was to always accompany public educators throughout their lives, growing old together, to show tenderness -, but the original media materials supply organization, harbored the idea of ​​reversing, and intended to sell the wool blanket for its appearance at a high price; it was not voluntary, but forced! The body cannot be the master, containing this sunken injustice! I have never dared to have distant faith and righteousness, and give birth to two ambitions! It is really the original media that is playing tricks and profiting from it!</p>
<p>Now the wool blanket has lost its body to others, and Bai Bi has a stain! People's words are terrifying, and I want to jump out of the fire pit! I have repeatedly negotiated with the original media, sincerely from the good (public educators), but the cunning matchmaker is doing evil, and even tempting me to redeem myself at a high price! With the fragile appearance of the wool blanket, I dare not compete; I can only contain injustice and weep, who will pity me? If public educators and others miss the tenderness and affection of the wool blanket? It is better to sue the cunning matchmaker for turning his back and deceiving the wool blanket into falling into Pingkang! Once there is a day of public trial, the wool blanket should go to court to testify, in order to punish the traitor and express the anger of the crowd. I urgently weep injustice as above, I hope you will thoroughly investigate, it is really very hard!</p>
<p>American Blanket Respectfully</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross Section</p>
<h3>The Organization of Beggars 18</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiajin</p>
<p>True and False Passengers</p>
<p>The local beggar gangs are stuck in the Shanghai market. Although they try hard to survive, they are ubiquitous, but they are always disheveled and haggard. It is not the ambition of a man. Therefore, the general young and strong people decided to find another way, which is in line with the original color of their "men's ambition is in all directions." These beggars, with lofty aspirations, actually went far away and began their travel career. This is the new route of the so-called "flying kite" in the beggar gang. However, this kind of livelihood still does not get rid of fraudulent methods. "Flying kite" means walking on boats. Shanghai has convenient transportation, and the water and land routes are as dense as cobwebs. The local beggar gangs can use the opportunity to travel to and from various places all year round without spending a penny. Moreover, every time they go out, they are sure to "tease the rake" (getting money). Without the real ability to stand alone, how can you build a family empty-handed?</p>
<p>Performance on the Boat</p>
<p>These people pretend to be passengers on the boat every day, and their clothes are quite neat, not revealing the true colors. When the passengers are complete and the boat leaves, they begin their crying and laughing skills. First, they greet the passengers next to them, and gradually talk about their own affairs. Then, they fabricate their past identity, such as being a businessman in their hometown, but unexpectedly suffered a disaster, the shop went bankrupt, and his wife died and his children were scattered. It seems that all the suffering in life is concentrated on one person. So the passengers on the boat gathered to ask questions, respectfully listening to his speech. Chinese people have always been honest and generous, especially when they have plenty of time on the journey and like to meddle in other people's business. Everyone meets by chance, and they feel particularly close. Soon, everyone spreads the word, and everyone can't help but feel pity. The beggar thinks that the good opportunity should not be missed, and asks the public for alms. At this time, everyone will generously donate money. In a short time, the collected number is considerable. When the ticket inspector comes, he finds that there is no ticket. The passengers will intercede for him and give him preferential treatment. Therefore, the beggar not only gets a free ride, but also returns fully loaded. The next day, he takes another ship back to Shanghai, and can repeat the tragedy again. After a long time, the crew will inevitably see through the trick, so they have to bribe them to silence them. Sometimes, they even need to distribute lubrication to be safe. But no matter what, as long as they travel a few times a month, the total income is far better than their peers on Zhengzhu Street.</p>
<p>This kind of "flying kite" drama is most common on ships traveling on the Yangtze River. The second is on sea vessels traveling to Ningbo Shaoxing. It turns out that the Shanghai Ningbo Shaoxing Association has regulations that poor fellow villagers who have fallen on Shanghai can be given a free boat ticket back home by the Association. The beggar pretends to be a fellow villager, but his goal is not the boat ticket, but to get a letter of introduction. The letter states that they can receive two yuan of ocean (the real situation before the war) from a certain place after returning home. And on the boat, they can rely on wonderful performances to get great benefits. Who would have thought that the Association's preferential treatment would instead create a slippery business for the beggars?</p>
<p>Station Drama</p>
<p>In addition to the "sea mountain" (ship) on the waterway, they also operate at the railway station. People in the gang call the train "flying centipede." But on the train, they can't ask passengers for help, because the feelings of passengers in the same car are very weak, not as cordial as the passengers on the boat who "share the same boat." Moreover, a fourth-class ticket is definitely not free. After they get off at their destination, they begin their crying and laughing performance when the passengers are crowded at the station. Asking the passengers for assistance. Several buses come and go at a station every day. Passengers are also constantly flowing, and the beggar can be active at Station A one day, and then take the bus to Station B the next day. Although they are dusty and tired, the income is considerable. This is the new route for the "flying kite" gang to leave the dock.</p>
<h3>If I Were to Form a Party</h3>
<p>— Gu</p>
<p>If I were to form a party, first and foremost, I would choose the best name: "Equal Freedom Democratic Party." Perhaps some might think the name is too long, but because it needs to fit practical needs, it must be this way.</p>
<p>Then, I must publish a declaration, stating that our party grew from the grassroots, therefore, we can certainly represent true public opinion. The party's policy is based on "Equal Freedom Democracy," so it will certainly always consider the people. This declaration does not need to be long, but the words "the people" must be mentioned as often as possible.</p>
<p>As long as we have a few "cadres," then I will certainly claim that our party members are spread throughout China, with an astonishing number – say, our party already has 200,000,001 members. In this way, it can prove that our party represents the "majority" of "public opinion."</p>
<p>With such a large number of party members, we should of course do something, because the purpose of our party is "everything for the people"!</p>
<p>Therefore, I will request the government to appoint our party members to positions within the National Government organization. The head of the Executive Yuan is needed, the head of the Legislative Yuan is needed, and of course, the Minister of Finance is also needed! The more, the better. When writing articles, one should insert the phrase: "Willing to be an official."</p>
<p>If the government agrees, then we'll talk about it after we become officials; (our party has a spirit of enterprise!) If it cannot be completely satisfactory, then this is because the government is not democratic, and we can organize ourselves.</p>
<p>My party will surely flourish, party members will surely have official positions, and, "everything for the people"! Should party members "not be suitable"?</p>
<h3>Talking About Xi'an on the Twelfth of December</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>The Xi'an dialect has many local phonetic components, which are quite interesting to outsiders. Xi'an people say "what place" as "yi ya da" (　　), like a Shanghai shirt trademark. Also, Xi'an calls "there" as "wu da" (ua), which is like the Japanese surname "Uda" in pronunciation. Other interesting examples include calling "head" as "duo la" or "sha."</p>
<p>The word "I" in Chang'an, generally has three pronunciations. One is "wu" (ngo), like the Cantonese pronunciation of "I". The second is "ngai", as far as I know, the Pearl River Delta also has this pronunciation. The third is "× ya" (wa), which is exactly the same as the ancient Japanese word for "I" which is pronounced as "wa". These three pronunciations have considerable value in phonological studies.</p>
<p>A certain Western medicine store in Xi'an has a telephone number of "606", and the number of its branch is "914".</p>
<p>There is a cinema in Xi'an called "Epang Palace." Someone asked him, when will you be showing the film "Burning Epang Palace"?</p>
<p>In late autumn and early winter in Xi'an, there is an inexpensive and delicious snack called "Persimmon Cake," which is made by mashing ripe red persimmons, mixing them with flour, and then deep-frying them until fragrant. The taste is delicious, not inferior to Western "cooked cakes" or Cantonese "steamed cakes".</p>
<p>A week ago, I saw an old villager on the street with his nose painted red, wearing a sheepskin coat inside out, with the white wool facing outwards. He was also riding a donkey backwards, that is, with his back facing the donkey's head and his face facing the donkey's buttocks. Most amusingly, he also had a chamber pot (of course, brand new!) hanging from his shoulders with a red string. Before the procession, there were several people playing music and carrying offerings of tea, fruit, and snacks for the gods. It was said to be a local custom of offering thanks to the gods for the birth of a baby boy to an old man. However, whether this gentleman was following Xi'an customs or if this custom was brought from another town, was not investigated, and I dare not make a reckless judgment.</p>
<p>In Xi'an, the newlywed "teasing the bride" custom involves all sorts of pranks, more than half of which are semi-forced and semi-willingly making the newlyweds kiss in public, which shows that "rouge" is not an imported product.</p>
<p>"Dream of the Red Chamber" describes the sights and objects of Western Capital, and many of the place names and temple names mentioned in it still exist today. For example, the rich store opened by Aunt Xue and Wang Xifeng's family, is repeatedly mentioned in the book as being on "West Street" next to the "Drum Tower." This building and street name still exist today, and is one of the crossroads in the city center, but the "Drum Tower" has been without drums for a long time. On the top of the building, there is only a huge horizontal plaque with the inscription "Sound Heard in Heaven." Since the War of Resistance, the building has been equipped with an air-raid siren, a coincidental concurrence.</p>
<p>The lowest-level brothel district in Xi'an, "Duck Pit," is like calling prostitutes "wild chickens" elsewhere, or Cantonese people calling them "cat caves," suggesting prostitutes are not human, but domestic fowl, which is the same thing. A certain gentleman wrote "Lament of Duck Pit," and here are a few lines excerpted below:</p>
<p>"...</p>
<p>There are no ducks or eggs in the pit,</p>
<p>The pit is full of pitiful people.</p>
<p>Ducks are sometimes human.</p>
<p>Ducks float in the green water of the pond,</p>
<p>In the Duck Pit, the body is scorched by fire.</p>
<p>Ducks eat fish and shrimp but don't eat ducks,</p>
<p>In the world, only people eat people!</p>
<p>..."</p>
