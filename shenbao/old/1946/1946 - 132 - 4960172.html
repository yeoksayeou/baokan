<h3>周恩來答訪邵力子　和平商談可望恢復　攻協小組會下週重開</h3>
<p>〔為本報南京十一日電〕軍事三人小組會譏，今日未舉行，徐永昌·周恩來兩氏全日未往訪馬使，亦未通電話，有所接觸，今日－日中，訪馬使者上午僅俞大維將軍一人，下午有自長春脫險歸來之二美聯社記者，曾往訪馬使。白魯德今曾訪周恩來，談約一小時，今日上午九時邵力子曾往訪周恩來未晤，晚五時周氏曾至邵寓訪晤，並作一般性之談話。據邵氏稱，目前政府與中共均希繼續做商談，研究一和平方案，又據邵告本報記者下週（即自明日起）內可能有三種會議之召集，一為國共商談，一為政治協商會議之綜合小組會議，又一為憲草審議會之協商小組會議，舉行日期，尚未確定。至三會是否同時舉行，亦未定，目前最重要者為軍事問題，無軍事三人小組會，無所協議，則其他各項問題，均不易解決。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕鄂北停止衝突獲得協議消息，來至此間後，週來為濃雲幾罩之調處執行部，已恢複其和諧之空氣。今日政府方面人士對鄂北事件之評論為：「天下本無事」，中共方面則歡迎此一協議，並期其實施。執行部中共參謀長羅瑞卿欣然告記者︰「雖和平前送尚有危機，值得憂慮，但鄂北協成當為雙方共謀和平解決一般問題之又一新開始」。但以記者觀測中原事件之解決，僅足熄減局部之戰火，而如何撲減白山黑水間戰火，實為當前中國治亂之關鍵。邇來東北政治接收，因共產黨問題迄無法展開，軍事方面則正進行激烈而膠着之戰爭，長春鐵路方面，政府中共軍仍拉鋸於四平街迄八面城之綫，雙方皆難期大進展。瀋陽西南國軍進入本溪之役，殲滅共軍頗衆，然若沿安奉綫深入安東，則國際上有無新變化，殊難斷言。最近北滿蘇方除撤去其軍隊外，並其外交鐵路人員及僑民，亦向蘇境撤退，用意如何，殊值重視。總之，東北問題須從速澄清，否則恐將愈難收拾。華北方面雙方俱在準備萬一，然並無外傳嚴重。協和醫院中雖百花已隨春開放，無復鮮艷色彩，但全院花木欣欣向榮，一二月內如無氷雹暴風雨，尚不致無結果。</p>
<h3>白魯德自譬醫師　願雙方執行協議　鄂中共軍要求轉移蘇北</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十日電〕（遲到）三人小組返漢後，因過於疲勞，當晚無甚會談，至十日晨九時起始繼續進行會外商談，午後二時徐周自三氐復舉行正式會譏，對中共所提要求，重作商討，歷時一小時許，三氏接見記者，發表協議文書，內容共七點，全係根據中共所提片面要求而定，具見我政府忍讓求全之苦心，尤可告慰國人者，協議書內僅有制止「小規模」戰鬥及「步哨」衝突之字樣，足微中原軍民問題不如外傳之嚴重。旋各記者分向三氏叩詢此行觀感，徐周兩氏均表沉默，僅白氏莞爾曰，余之身份儼如醫師，實不宜隨便宣布病人病狀，所可言者，願雙方執行協議耳，語畢，三氏即乖機飛京。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十日電〕（　到）王天嗚，周恩來，白魯德三氏及隨員記者等一行五十餘人，赴宣化店經過如下：（一）就目擊所得，除共軍佯作備　態勢外，該區尚安謐，絕少衝突跡象可尋。（二）中工方面雖仍誇張被轉之嚴重性，並提出各征莫須有之要求，但因政吋代表表現最大之容忍，故雙方談判頗為和諧。（三）中共要求之得心，在使共軍轉移蘇北，其理由為轉入「自己地區」後，即可避免衝突，求得和平。（四）特別小組仍留該區，繼續調查。</p>
<h3>本溪湖新城南　激戰正進行中</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕新華社稱，本淡方面戰事仍在太子河南繼積進行中，本溪有新舊二城，舊城在太子河北，為國軍所佔，新城亦名宮原，在河南，仍在共軍手中，國軍正沿安濟鐵路及兩側向新城推進，抵達新城南方十里橋頭車站前方，兩軍激戰甚烈，四平街廿三天仍相持中。</p>
<h3>陸總部發言人　駁斥延安廣播</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕中國陸軍總部發言人，頃駁斥五月十日延安廣播，停戰後國軍調動之統計中所述各節，完全與事實不符，據稱：渦去國軍之調動，均限於接防行動，陸軍總部每次皆通知北平調處執行部。該廣播稱：國軍七十三軍於三月間全部秘密空運濟南，尤屬無稽，共產黨專事捏造謠言，顯係抹飾其自身違反停戰命令之行動。又如延安五月九日之廣播中，妄稱國軍破壞隴海路東段，查該段向為共軍强佔，封鎖嚴密，阻碍通車，所調由國軍破壞，不知從何說起。</p>
<h3>遺送東北日人　將由美軍辦理　協定已在簽字</h3>
<p>〔聯台社瀋陽十日電〕東北保安司令杜聿明今日宣布：東北日人一百三十萬名，將由國府與美軍合作遺送回國，還送協定已由杜司令與美軍代表費德曼上校在藩陽簽字，遺送事宜可望於九月三十日完成。記者問東北約百分之七十，現由共單控制，如何能使共軍佔領區日人出境，費德曼答稱：「我自有辦法」。費德曼並稱，至少每日遺送日人五千名，先由葫蘆島出口，然後設法由大連及營口輸送。據中國官方稱；瀋陽有日人二十四萬三千名，山海關至瀋陽之間共有六萬二千名，被遺送回國者，包括軍民人等，惟戰犯不在其內。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕中宣部長吳國楨對將長滬市說，以極表謙虛之語氣答記者稱：此事曾於去歲十月間提及，然本人以滬市為世界大都會之一，我國經濟中心所在地，資任重大，深恐不能勝任，故未敢貿然承咎。現中樞以吳氏歷任漢口，重慶市長，勤政愛民，頗著賢聲，　為主席及宋院長所　　　　　　　　　　　，將稱恰</p>

<h3>艾師在日談東來任務　研討美軍各問題　建立基地乃保障世界和平</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員十一日電〕艾森豪威爾將軍今日在此招待外國及日本記者，據稱：渠此次來至太平洋，其目的乃在硏究該區美軍之各項問題，美國擬對士兵施行再敎育，使其成爲民主之鬥士。艾帥又謂：就戰略觀點而言，美海陸軍應予以合併。記者詢以美軍準備留駐日本之期限，艾帥答稱：渠曾與麥克阿瑟談及此事，麥帥認爲非俟日人具有更有價值之民主頭腦，佔領工作決不中止。關於德國，艾帥認爲最困難者，厥爲政治思想，德國已被毁，重建工作，非自最底層做起不可。艾帥在答復本報記者時稱：「本人希望中國能成爲完全自由之國家，以便與其盟國共同建立世界和平」。艾帥稱中蘇軍隊均將參加佔領日本，又除負有暫時任務之美軍外，美國在菲列濱已無特別隊伍，因菲島已成爲獨立國家也。艾帥邀請本報記者隨美　赴視察大反·神戶·及京都之美駐軍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十一日電〕美國陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威今日在此間招待記者，謂美國在太平洋之基地問題，其全部關鍵，須視聯合國機構能吾成爲一種保障世界和平之勢力。艾帥並重述其一再發表之信念稱：「世界經不起再有一次戰爭，此點我們都明白」。並謂：當前大問題厥在使舉世明瞭，從前引起戰爭之各種問題，必須經由聯合國機構予以解決。美國在菲律濱之基地問題，固亦須視聯合國機構前途，此際則須與菲律濱成立協定，予以確定。美軍在華，旣以盟軍資格，襄助其恢復戰後秩序，則不久即常撤退。關於蘇軍參加佔領日本一事，艾帥謂最近未聞有何談判，惟中國即將派軍前來，菲律濱亦有一師即可開到，英軍則早已開到。先是，艾帥說明其出巡太平洋之動機，謂擬研究與歐洲方面戰事有關係軍事敎訓，俾作遠大計劃之參考。此類智識，可由與麥帥及其他將領會談中取得之。此間將領所用之跳島戰術，與歐洲戰區大規模登陸戰，不斷攻擊敵軍主力情形，完全不同。此外，尙有佔領問題及日本人再敎育之改向民主問題，其中最重要者厥爲繼續駐紮足額兵力，以完成此項任務，所用方法，必須對各方皆公道。太平洋方面士氣甚佳，所見美軍士兵均樂於盡職，但此非即謂荒島孤軍無思回家者。德國佔領事宜，亦完全不同，該處美軍數月來成績極佳。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京十一日電〕美國賠款專員鮑萊今日在此間宣稱：日本賠償計劃，不致使日本生產能力减低至一九三三年以下。日本仍將保持充分生產力，足以製造民衆所需各物。一九三三年後，日本生產量突飛犯進，其大都份爲戰時用品，賠償計劃即在將此次戰事生產力，予以消滅。予擬俟獲得蘇聯允許後，赴朝鮮北部及中國東北九省視察。如常地工業配備確已移走，將依據美國立塲提供意見。美國所着重者爲中國·朝鮮北部·及東北九省之經濟問題，而不在於此項設備之價値若十。日本在遠東各國之資產，於支配賠款時，亦將列入。各國留有日本資產者，刻已請其造册具報，其他有關國家方在討論賠償問題，本人曾建議組織特別委員會處理此事，但未得覆</p>

<h3>現階段的對外貿易問題</h3>
<p>— 俞增康</p>
<p>勝利以後，海運開通，行將半年，但國際貿易的進展始終　悲觀的氣氛之中。我國的對外貿易，原不甚合理，况今又增加很多的困難，貿易趨勢，自更難獲正常了。對外貿易的合理與否，有關整個經濟的發展，所以當前的貿易問題，急待調整而有合理的解決。作者謹就管見所及，略抒所懷，就正於高明</p>
<p>二月四日外匯市塲開放後，現在的匯率，按購買力平價　言，國幣偏高，於是迎口容易，出口不利，並且工業方面甚至農產方面都感得嚴重威脅，漸趨恐慌了。於是本月初旬，關於外匯政策，又發生許多謠言，並且美鈔價格，隨着有激烈的波動。美鈔不定，外匯也就難安定，此即可窺知匯率多少已有間題。同時，論　上也發生貶低幣値提高匯價的主張。我國今後　求生產力的增强，經濟地位的提高，則必須謀貿易的擴張，但欲擴張貿易，必先振興輸出，有了更多的輸出，遂能換得更多的輸入，以利經濟建設的推進。爲促進輸出，則必須有有利的匯率以鼓勵之，所以各國都以貶低幣値爲競爭國際市塲的唯一手段。而且，目前的不合理之進口，允須急速阻止。理雖如　，但在如今過渡時期，國內經濟尙未安定，對於匯價的放長，我們尙不敢茍同。因爲：其一，目前的匯率，雖不是固定的，但設時加更動，又將引起人民對法幣信心的動搖，美妙黃金的投機，更將引起金融混亂的再演。其二，目前的物價，在通貨膨脹尙不能終止之特，匯率如經更動，物價決不會因爲其比例已高於匯價的比例而就停在那裏，仍必跟着匯價的放長而上　，匯價與物價暫難調整，則出口商的希望，仍難實現。况物價的再起動搖，更非工商業之利。其三，目前國內的生產狀况，極爲惡劣，可供輸出的數量極爲徵小，所以由提高匯價四所能獲得的促進輸出之效，恐也是有限得很。所以在目前對於匯率的更動，是須深加攷慮的。</p>
<p>其次，我們現在固不希望由提高匯價　更刺激物價的波動，同時也不希望以有限的外匯資金，供不必要的浪費，而再蹈黃金政策的覆轍。所以我們希望一方面須從整理財政和緊縮通貨着手，使物價問題獲得根本解決，藉以減輕對匯率的威脅；同時在外匯的本身上，目前與其更訂匯率，不如先在結匯和貿易管理的技術上，予以改變，藉以調整目前的貿易狀况，又可改善現行匯率的不合理狀態。如是，幣信旣不動搖，且尙可匯得較更改匯率的更多之利。</p>
<p>爲着目前的復員和將來的建設，須大量的輸入，產業方能　以開發，國家乃可進入現代化的境地；但爲完成建國的使命，輸入又必須合理。所惜目前的輸入，實在未能適合建國的方針：共一，進口品中，大都不是建設上所需的生產器材，反而只是些消費性的物資；其二，進口商人每不問國內的供需狀况，而祇問國內外價格差額的多少，盲目進行，致成進口過剩之弊，燒鹹一項，即可爲證，其三，進口商人所訂之貨，每不問國內是否需要，致大量進口的芙棉，在國內的銷路很是有限。如是的進口，亂七八糟，絕無規劃，旣不能改善國內的生產狀况，解救物資恐慌，而徒耗有限的外匯基金，其不經濟，殊可嘆惜！並且消費品的洋貨大量進口，徒然增重對工業的威脅，阻礙工業復員的推進；而盲從的進口則甚至就商人盈利的眼光來說，也就難有把握。此種趨勢，於國家和商人，都是無利可言，政附斷不可任其長久拖延下去，再不速謀改善。至於提高匯價，對此不合理的狀態，雖能有若干的改善，但究不能全部矯正，且於目前更動，又多不便。所以爲求輸入之能合理進展，以適合經濟上的需要，則唯有改變結匯和貿易管理上的技術，以强化管制的一法。作者以爲對目今國內物資的供需狀况和需要品種，當局即須詳細調查，並作統盤的籌劃，給予進口商人以積極的指導，使輸入能合理化和計劃化，則上述的輸入過剩和不合需要之弊，都可袪除。同時，對於結匯方面，也確須力加改善，如爲生產器材和必需物資則須給以種種便利；如徒爲消費物品，則須嚴格審核，除國內所不能生產或生產不足者以外，應遏止或减少其輸入，務使輸入品種能由消費性的改爲生產性的。如是，旣可解除工業的恐慌，復可增强我生產力，對常前物價問題的解決，必能有很大的助益。</p>
<p>由此可知，今後輸入的增加，必很可觀，尤以生產性物資爲甚，這是推進工業化時所必然的結果。爲應付此巨大的輸入，雖可賴外資的途徑，然究須努力輸出，以增强對外的購買力，並可藉求民族資本的發展。今後出口貿易在經濟建設上的重要性，可以知之矣。輸出的振興，向爲必然。目前出口貿易雖很悲觀，但終須設法補救，力求改進，以爲他日大量擴展的準備。目前匯率的不利於輸出，這是暫時的現象，他日自必調整的，但將來的輸出，也不能僅賴於提高匯價的，因爲過高的匯價，不是戰後經濟建設所需尙要的。况且過去輸出的所以不振，亦有其根本的原因，此等癥結，如不解除，則雖定有利的匯率，其展發也必有限，仍不能適應經濟建設的需要。所以目前對於振興輸出，與其爭論於匯率的更改，不如從速的作根本改革，以增强輸出能力。按發展輸出，是以充分的生產力和强大的推銷力爲必要條件，我國的出口物資，距此條件尙遠，如不改進，何能競爭於國際市塲，以取優勢的地位？關於此點，依淺見所及，似應注意於下列數端：其一，我國主要出口品的絲茶，在戰爭期間，已遭受嚴重的摧殘，非但生產數量大爲減少，即品質亦已降低，自然急須恢復，俾能重振輸出，但此決非短期所能奏效，而更須國家的積極援助。其二，我國的輸出，尙限於農產品和原料品，輸出品類的狹窄，實使貿易發展受重大的限制，是以今後於出口貨種類，須積極的擴大，藉以增强輸出的能力。並且尙須擴及於製造品，以改善交換條件，調整貿易趨勢，當爲提高經濟地位上所必要的。此點關係重大，須密切注意，積極改進。其三，品質必須改進，更須劃一而標準化，使能鞏固並擴大市塲，而佔優勢地位。其四，保障生產者的利益，使能增加生產，減低出口成本，以增强在外的競爭力。此兩者措置，端在於中間剝削層的減除。其五，强化貿易組織，政府並須實施獎勵政策，使輸出貨物的推銷力，得以增强。上述五點，都是促進輸出上的基本問題，急待解決，不容再緩。</p>
<p>關於市場問題，也是發展出口貿易上的一個重要問題。爲求輸出的大量擴展，非求其多角不可，現今好像只集中注意於美國，也是不對的。我們必須向世界各地努力的找尋市塲，更須適合市塲而緊握之。原來我國輸出主要市塲的南洋，自日本沒落後，我國允須迅速奮起以代替之，俾處於領導地位，因爲南洋可爲今後發展我國工業製品的極有希望的市塲，而助我工業化的建設。今後對美輸出，將以特產的原料爲主，更須輔以精美的手工業製品；對南洋的輸出，則須價廉的工業製品。此等輸出，都是適合我國生產能力的。在戰後，旣有如是廣大的市塲，出口商和產業家，應有遠大的目光，從速進取，以面將來的擴展，切不可因目前力量薄弱，匯率不利，而自廿遺棄。尤以南洋市塲方面，倘我國再事因循，日本很可能的迅速恢復輸出，且印度紡織業已有餘力可以供給，如竟坐失良機，則將來要國爭取市塲，決非易事，對於我工業發展又將有嚴重的不良影響了。</p>
<p>總之，今後的對外貿易，必須配合國家經濟建設政策的，開，所以對於當前的不合理狀態，自應從速改善。至於輸出，應先努力於原來　結的解除，增加生產，同時改善經營，爭取市塲，這都是先決問題，而更改匯率在目前則尙非其時。</p>

<h3>四國對義大利問題　僵局已局部打開　蘇同意的黎波里由聯合國托管　昨績舉行非正式會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：瀕於破裂之外長會議，今已復活。昨日蘇英法外長懇出新建議如次：（一）蘇聯同意放棄對的黎波里坦尼亞之托管要求，在聯合國監視下，由義大利自行管理。（二）英方同意放棄里比亞獨立計劃，並由義大利實施對的黎波里坦尼亞托管制度，但英方必須獲得西倫奈加之托管權。（三）法外長建議蘇聯應自義國獲得賠款二千五百萬鎊，其他賠償，則可由割土代替之。莫洛託夫表示並不反對，但貝爾納斯則主張二百五十萬鎊應取自義國在外之工業資產。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：義大利賠償及殖民地問題，今日仍爲四强外長會議討論之主題，得失參半。昨日莫洛託夫與貝文突然努力就義大利殖民問題覓尋妥協，同時在今日非正式會談時，各外長對於蘇方要求義國賠償問題，亦曾作最後之努力，企圖覓取妥協方法。查本週內，外長會議變化極大，日前談判已陷僵局，現因各外長之最後掙扎，已露一綫曙光矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕四國外長會議今日似見好轉，關於義大利屬地處理辦法，美國務卿貝爾納斯贊成蘇外長莫洛托夫動議，但附以條件，即於十年後應允許利比亞及伊利特里亞獨立。惟據英方消息稱：英外相貝文曾堅持利比亞及伊利特里亞應即予獨立，並要求將利比亞之西倫奈加托英國代管。一部份觀察家認爲莫洛托夫所採行動，足以暗示蘇聯殆欲避免任何破壞將來和平會議之責任。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十日電〕四强外長爲打開其關於歐洲和的問題之僵局，今日宣佈已草就初步協定三項：（一）將義大利之南非殖民地置於聯合國託治下；（二）由義大利以一億元之賠款給予蘇聯；（三）指派盟國委員會監督戰犯之審訊事宜。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕外長會議關於義大利問題之僵局，似已局部打破，莫洛托夫已同意放梁由蘇聯單獨托管的黎波里坦尼亞之要求，而贊成法國之建議，將該地由聯合國托管，並允許義大利參加。貝爾納斯復建議應加附帶條件，規定里比亞與伊利特里亞於十年內可能使其獨立，始可贊成法國之建議，當時雖未成立協定，但其可能性似已不小。英代表貝文對於西倫奈加及賽奴西亞兩地，主張由英國托管，關於賠款問題，法國亦提出折衷辦法，蘇聯原要求義大利賠款三萬萬元，其中一萬萬元係付給希臘與南斯拉夫者，畢杜爾認爲南斯拉夫或可獲得若干疆界之讓步，而蘇聯乃盟國之中唯一未曾控制義國外資金之國家，故其要求亦不得認爲過份。貝爾納斯當允許考慮此一建議，並表示或可贊成。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾對記者闡述　組歐洲聯邦計劃　謂可先從局部着手逐漸擴大　對德國局勢表示不安</h3>
<p>〔路透社阿姆斯特丹十一日電〕邱吉爾昨向荷蘭新聞記者五十餘人發表談話稱：吾人若不能組織包括整個歐洲之聯邦，亦應先就所得組織之部份組織起來，然後再使其逐漸擴大。邱翁對德國之局勢表示不安，渠希望德國人民能儘速自立。記者有詢以西歐在組織聯邦之初，是否應等待蘇聯之同意者？邱翁答稱：此乃吾人應等待至何時之問題，亦即不決之點云。邱翁昨午在宮中與威廉女王共餐，下午赴萊登大學接文博士學位。</p>
<h3>邱氏此種主張　提出已非一次</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐的十日電〕邱吉爾主張包括東歐西歐，成立歐洲聯邦，此戲劇式之提議，已重行推動曾經數代硏究之理想主義。邱氏提出此驚人計劃，適在蘇聯與西方聯合國家間關係岌岌，一髮千鈞之際，氏方於兩日前對蘇聯表示忠實諒解，謂如此當可避免災禍。所値得注意者，則爲邱氏主張此種團結已非一次。當一九四〇年法國於慘敗中向德國呼籲和平時，邱氏領導之政府即提議與法國訂立神聖聯合協定。此項計劃，將使英法宣行合併爲一個英法聯邦，不復分而爲二。但願邱氏對於其目前所提之計劃再加分析，特別是「包括東西歐兩部」一語。蘇聯在實際上，已將東歐全部及巴爾幹牛島歸入其勢力範圍，顯然已創立一東部聯邦，是則祇須再造成一西部聯合，即可進謀兩部之協調。歐洲聯邦之理想，在十九世紀中討論已不知多少次。北美合衆國維持四十八洲之團結旣獲成功，提倡此計劃者大率皆因此受其鼓勵。就歷史方面言，自羅馬帝國崩潰之後，先後主張組織歐洲聯邦者，遠之有拿破崙，近之有第一次世界大戰後法國外長白里安。據白里安計劃，歐洲聯邦共有領土一百九十三萬二千萬哩，人口二千五百萬，世人對於此事，贊成者認爲頗足動人，反對者則視爲長髮理想主義者之追求而已。</p>
<h3>伊朗與亞省談判　已成立部份協定</h3>
<p>（路透社德黑蘭十一日電）伊朗中央政府業已與亞塞爾拜然代表就若干事件成立協定，如關於亞省國民軍之處置，中央政府允許將其蘭入中央軍並保持官佐原有階級。聞亞省所提其他要求，尙難爲中央政府接受。政府方面表示。如不能就每一事項成立協定，談判仍不免究全失敗。</p>

<h3>宋院長關懷民食　川米二百萬石　緊急輸送來滬　由招商局輸及所租登陸艇載運　糧政當局令米商趕赴產區採購</h3>

<p>又連日米價上漲，頗爲一般人所焦慮，據調查主要原因，係由於各產米區域縣政府，爲維持當地民食，多有類似禁糧出口等措施。記者昨分赴本市各米碼頭實地視察，日來運到米糧，數量確較稀少，致演成糧價飛漲現象。現糧政當局，對此極爲關切，昨又召集豆米業公會，及米糧經紀公會，趕印採購證明書，尅日分發各糧商，馳赴各產米區，憑證採購，以疏米源。據豆米業公會負責人聲稱：本市存米極　，僅民間存米一項，亦達七八十萬石以上云。</p>

<p>錢能夏</p>
<p>三十六歲，靑浦人，住南京丹鳳橋一四六號。原任上海市黨部幹事，民國廿八年秋，參加僞組織，充任僞上海市黨部總務科長；三十年九月，任僞交通部簡任秘書；卅二年二月，任僞社會福利部簡任秘書；同年四月，改任該部職業司長；六月調任總務司司長。三十四年一月，任僞南京市社會福利局長；同年四月，兼任僞南京市房屋調解委員會主任委員；三十四年七月，任僞南京市經濟局局長。實有觸犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪嫌，故由高檢處提起公訴。昨晨開庭，錢身穿黑色團花新綢長袍，脚登黃色皮鞋。答供如演講，謂渠地下工作人員，因失去聯絡，又爲生活所迫，山窮水盡，遂走末路。邱推事斥其旣爲關民黨黨員，爲何叛國叛黨？錢逆克狡稱：「所以我專做社會福利事業，爲民服務」。</p>
<p>劉煒俊</p>
<p>四十四歲，福建長汀人，住愚園路六〇八弄內田莊一百號；畢業於北平淸華大學經濟系。原任中央硏究院科學硏究所圖書管理員，於民國廿七年八月，任僞財政部薦任編纂；廿八年擢升僞財政部稅則委員會委員；廿九年三月，任偽行政院參事廳簡任編纂；三十年三月，任僞經濟委員會　任秘書；三十二年二月，升任僞建設部總務司長；三十三年十月，改任僞實業部保險監理局局長；同年五月，又任偽實業局水產管理局局長。勝利後經軍事機關逮捕。昨晨到庭時，穿藍袍，着布鞋，薙光頭，乃一胖子。據其供稱，彼之投僞，完全受生活壓迫，因早婚，生孩子太多，妻又生病，沒辦法時，去向陳錦濤借錢，遂被委任僞職，並對起訴書辯白三點：（一）彼之翻譯英國經濟學泰半凱英斯之『和平會議的因果』，乃受陳連錦濤之囑，欲對付日本之經濟侵路者，與起訴書所謂「謀中日經濟提携」之旨相反。（二）彼之做「中國之出口稅」一文，乃恭維中央宋院長在民國十八年所行出口稅政策，而批評廿七年所行稅則之修改不良者。（三）計劃壓迫漁民，防止海上游擊隊云云，乃因漁業公會函稱，太湖運魚來滬，抽稅凡二十餘道，要求保護，故有此計劃，但未經上司批准，絕未爲者漁民。</p>
<p>王永康</p>
<p>五十一歲，上海人，住霞飛路八五五弄一號，爲中國貿易銀行之股東，曾任僞外交部僑務局專員，且曾開設永安俱樂部賭窟。王身材魁梧，衣深綠色長袍，着黑布鞋，頗帶「流腔」。據其供稱，彼不識字，且無甚財產，民國三十二年三月，由周邦俊之介紹，得以認識褚民誼，爲避免封鎖時之行動不自由，乃由褚予以僞外交部僑務局專員官職，然迄未到差辦事。邱推事問他可曾拜褚民誼做乾爹，他絕對否認。至於永安賭台事，謂係王愛棠劍設，時爲民國三十年八月，資本由彼處借云，但並未預先聲明用途，故半年後即行追還云。　護人　懷羣律師起立，向庭上聲明三點：一，被吿乃自行投案，並非受逮；二被吿不識字，事實上不能做僞官，而上海與被吿同名者達六七人，恐係得罪人而被誣；三·賭台確非被吿所設，可吊執照查騐。以上三案，庭諭改期再訊。</p>

<h3>警察局宣局長　解釋設置「警管區」制　防止不良份子危害社會　加強警員效率保障治安</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市警察局局長宣鐵吾，曁副局長兪叔平等，爲使社會人士明瞭「警營區」制實情，避免誤會起見，特於昨日下午四時，在市府大禮堂招待各記者談話。</p>
<p>負責一定區域</p>
<p>宣氏解釋「警管區」制，乃一極尋常之警察制，並非特殊事件，其目的乃在加強警察工作，改進制度，令每一警察負責一定區械，使全民對治安之希望有更大保障。外界不明眞相，以爲警察將自由出入市民門戶，而惶惶不安。事實上，警員非有特殊情事需探問，決不任意相擾。警察如有事訪問戶口，目前即可實行，毋需在實行警管區後開始。依據國家法令明文規定，警察可負有一部分司法工作，爲「確實保障人民自由」，對某種罪犯有權拘捕。又據民十九年三月四日內政部頒布經常警士服務規則中第三十九條：『巡邏警士應將本管區內曲折道路，狹偏街道，戶口確數，市民職業，經濟狀况等調查明白』，第四十條又稱：對（一）受徒刑之執行，　宣吿緩刑者，（二）素行不正者，（三）暴貧暴富，收入不敷等者，（四）來往顧客人事移動，（五）旅館工廠戶口調動等，均應隨時加以查察，以防不良份子危害社會，故凡屬優良份子當無反對理由。</p>
<p>榮案情形複雜</p>
<p>宣氏又謂，上海今日環境與民二十五年或二十六年大不相同，當時未經變亂，秩序亦未破壞，而目前失業者充斥社會，再爲物價高漲所壓迫，治安困難，乃屬意料中事。在此由亂至靜之過程中，維持治安力量，至少應較戰前高出一倍，而實際現有警員，共八千餘人，僅爲戰前之一事。上海接收之初，至三月份，盜刦案由一百四十餘件降至八十餘件，但至四月份又增至百餘件，主要原因，乃因物價飛騰，人民無以維持生活，局方已盡力破案。至榮德生案，情形複雜，與普通案件不同，能否破案，抑何時破案，尙不能確定。</p>
<p>「警管區」制現行設備，每期訓練五百人，每年分五期，在警局訓練所受訓，二月一期，再實習一月。並爲提高素質起見，均招妝優秀靑年，給與警員名義，按警官最低待遇委任十六級起。其職務分行政及刑事兩種，主要在調查戶口，登記人事移動，肪範匪徒等。每一警員管轄範圍，依該區戶口及警員人數爲比例，現有警察待遇自四月份起，改爲共得五萬二千元，其素質除一部份新警係招考者外，餘均受過去捕房訓練，另輸當年敎育，即責任各分局每日規定二小時訓練，故希社會人士勿存偏見，蔑視警員。</p>
<p>藝員登記辦法</p>
<p>關於藝員登記事，宣局長聲明在市府「管理上海市娛樂塲所第十六條規則」中，警局應調查藝員狀况，確實數目，對藝員權利有確實保障。現本市藝員不下萬人，其中雖有不少優良人才，但品行不良者，亦不在少數，警局當有取締權利。發給藝員證，與律師，醫師或身份證並無多大差別。若有自認優秀者，欲更變登記辦法，儘可請求警局轉市府辦理。</p>
<p>電影院對號入座，亦即在維持公共塲所秩序，有少數影院不予接受，羣起反對，提出理由，似不充足。若虧損不數，局方已同意請求市府每日准予添映一塲以資彌補，而事實上，秩序改善後，祗能增加收入，無虧損之理。此事經徐寄廣·王曉籟等請求展期後，已允寬緩。塲內禁止吸烟，邋一部份人反對，亦頗不合理。公共塲所烟霧瀰漫，有碍公共衛生，局方陸續接獲市民要求，切實禁止塲內吸烟者甚多。禁烟禁毒之工作，與維持治安，實有同樣重要。局方早經規定辦法，未遵守者查明後，均解法院究辦，一月間已解送三百餘人，如經人民檢舉報吿，決予查飭嚴辦。</p>
<h3>陳逮倫竊吉普車　週前已發生一次　死者之父昨往警局料理收屍　保衛團員挑康福解送警備部</h3>
<p>〔報訊〕據上海市車輛聯合檢查所消息，前日因偸竊吉普車而遭警士格斃之十六歲靑年學生陳逮倫，經調查後，發覺陳曾於上週日，已犯有竊草案，緣是日該所派員出外巡查時，途經新閘路，見有無主吉普車一輛，停靠路旁，當即上前檢查，方擬駕駛返所時，該陳逮倫即出而聲辯，並出示保衛團之臂章。該所以陳逮倫並無確鑿證件，當將該車加以扣留，而該所原則上扣車不扣人，故未將陳帶局，僅囑其補具證件，以憑領回該車，不意事隔數日，竟又發生第二次竊車案。又聞關於美憲兵遭狙擊殞命事，將如何解決，已由警備司令部會同美軍總部互商，謀取合理辦法</p>
<p>威脅美憲兵開槍中要害</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於美海軍納爾遜被靑年陳逮倫開槍狙擊斃命案，據悉：常納爾遜前日駕車駛至曹氏墓園門首時，該犯即出槍威脅納爾遜打倒車後轉，斯時納曾以手向後探摸，一面則舉帽向前面開行之四一一六〇號軍車吿急。不意陳逮倫當時即發槍三響，命中納之胸腹部。常第四槍擬向與納並坐之中國憲兵一名射擊時，幸該憲兵機警異常，躍軍而下，得免於難。同時前面軍車中之三警士，驟聞槍響，即縱身從車跳下，內中八七二八號警士蹲伏於曹氏墓園南牆角下，描準後面暴徒所坐車輛，連發三槍，一彈射中陳犯右脇下，貫穿左腰，當即身死，其父陳時俠昨晨曾往龍華警局，料理收屍。至保衛團員姚康福（因凶手之槍係從姚處得來），已移解警備司令部。</p>
<h3>姜公美被控案　日內可望擬判</h3>

<h3>西南聯大就昆明原址　樹立石刻記住碑　馮友蘭敎授撰文　由羅庸敎授書丹　聞一多敎授篆額</h3>
<p>〔木報昆明訊〕西南聯大於本月四日舉行結業典禮後，即就昆明原校址，樹立紀念碑，碑係石刻，由馮友嗣敎授撰文，羅庸敎授書丹，聞一多敎授篆額，原文長至千字以上，茲探誌如下：</p>
<p>西南聯大紀念碑　全文</p>
<p>中華民國三十四年九月九日，我國受日本之降於南京，上距二十六年七月七日蘆溝橋之變，爲時入年，再上距九月十八瀋陽之變，爲時十四年，再上距淸甲午之役，爲時五十一年。舉凡五十年間，日本所鯨吞蠶食於我國者，至是悉備圖籍獻還，全勝之局，秦漢以來所未有也。國立北京大學，國立濟華大學，原設北平。私立南開大學，原設天津。自瀋陽之變，我國家之威權，逐漸南移，惟以文化力量與日本爭持於平津，此三校實爲其中堅。二十六年平津失守，三校奉命遷於湖南，合組爲國立長沙臨時大學，以三校校長蔣夢麟。梅貽琦。張伯苓爲常務委員王持校務。設法理工學院於長沙，文學院於南獄，於十一月一日開始上課。迨京滬失守，武漢震動，臨時大學又奉命遷雲南。師生徒步經貴州，於二十七年四月二十六日抵昆明，旋奉命改名爲國立西南聯合大學，設理工學院於昆明，文法學院於蒙自，於五月四日開始上課，一學期後，文法學院亦遷昆明。二十七年增設師範學院，二十九年設分校於四川叙永，一學年後，併於本校。昆明本爲後方名城，自日軍入安南，陷緬甸，乃成後方重鎭，聯合大學支持其間，先後畢業學生二千餘人，從軍旅者八百餘人。河山旣復，日月重光，聯合大學之戰時使命旣成，奉令於三十五年五月四日結束，原有三校，即將返故居，復舊業。緬維八年支持之苦辛，與夫三校合作之協和，可紀念者蓋有四焉：我國家以世界之古國，居柬亞之天府，本應紹漢唐之遺烈，作益世之先進，將來建國完成，必於世界歷史居獨特之地位。蓋並世列强雖新而不古，希臘羅馬有古而無今，惟我國家自古至今，亦新亦舊，斯所謂「周雖舊邦，其命維新」者也。曠代之偉業，八年之抗戰，已開其規模，立其基礎，今日之勝利，於我國家有旋乾轉坤之功，而聯合大學之使命，與抗戰相終始，此其可紀念者一也。文人相輕，自古而然，昔人所言，今有同慨，三校有不同之歷史，各異之學風，八年之久，合作無間，同無妨異，異不害同，五色交輝，相得益彰，八音合諧，終和且平，此其可紀念者二也。萬物幷育而不相害，道並行而不相悖，小德川流，大德敦化，此天地之所以爲大，斯雖先民之恒言，實爲民主之眞諦，聯合大學以其兼容並包之精神，轉移社會一時之風氣，內樹學術自由之規模，外來民主堡壘之稱號，遠千夫之諾諾，作一士之諤鍔，此其可紀念者三也。稽之往史，我民族若不能立足於中原，偏安江表，雖曰南渡，南渡之人未有能北返者：晋人南渡，其例一也，宋人南渡，其例二也，明人南渡，其例三也，風景不殊，晋人之深悲，還我河山，宋人之深願，吾人爲第四次之南渡，乃能於不十年間，收恢復之全功，庾信不哀江南，社甫喜收薊北，此其可紀念者四也。聯合大學初定校歌勉辭，始歡南遷流雞之苦辛，中頌師生不屈之壯志，終寄最後勝利之期望，校以今日之成功，歷歷不爽若合符契，聯合大學之始終，　非一代之盛事，喊百世而　過者哉？爰就歌辭，勒爲碑銘，銘曰：痛南渡，辭宮闕，駐衡湘，又離別，更長征，經　日，望中原，遍腥血，抵絕　，繼講說，詩書哭，猶有古，儘笳吹，情彌切，千秋恥，終已雪，見仇寇，如烟滅，起朔北，迄南越，視金甌，已無缺，大一統，無傾拆，中興業，縱往烈，維三校，兄弟列，爲一體，如膠結，同艱難，共歡悅，聯合竟，使命撤，神京復，還燕碣，以此石，象堅節，紀嘉慶，吿來哲。</p>
<h3>李濟等赴日調查　發現我國文物　不久將開會報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕敎部淸理戰時文物損失委員會，爲調查戰爭期間我國公私文物之損失，以便向敵追償起見，前經先後於京滬。平津·武漢·東北等地，成立辦事處，實地調查，并舉辦全國公私文物損失登記，編擬損失清單，以爲將來索取賠償之準備。該會爲明瞭日本自甲午戰爭以來，刦奪我國文物之情形，俾與國內調查工作，切取聯繫起見，曾經徵得有關方面之同意，聘李濟（中央博物院籌備處主任），張鳳舉（敎部京滬區敎育復員輔導委會委員），兩氏赴日工作。據最近由渝來京之敎部杭次長（兼戰時文化委會主任委員）云：李張二氏，已事畢回國，承在日之美當局協助，予以調查便利，發現我國文物，不久即將開會，聽取報吿及討論。（愚）</p>
<h3>首都臨大先修班學生　升學問題已解決　杭次長到班訓話全體學生表示感謝</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕首都臨時大學先修班學生數百人，爲升學問題，特推代表多人，於八日赴敎部請願，學生要求多數保送，敎部以有辦法規定，未可全允學生要求。是日未能解決。九日下午二時，敎部杭立武次長，乃往四牌樓中央大學大禮堂，向該班全瞪學生訓話。</p>
<p>十七日考試後繼續上課兩週</p>
<p>首謂：二次世界大戰結束之後，我國與英美蘇聯，皆裁軍修政，偃戈止武，休養生息，惟維護和平，復員建設，在在需，，故抗勝之後，敎部對收很區之優秀靑年，力謀恢復其學業，曾呈請政院撥款，辦理臨時大學先修班，以作敎育人才，蔚爲國川，諸生受國家培養與期待之殷，應專攻學業，對於前途進修，如有意見，儘可呈由學校當局，或用書面陳述，不宜聚衆奔走，宜愛惜上課之寳貴光陰，而免外界發生誤會。繼謂：中大員生水陸並進，在木月內，即有四千人來京，故先修班不得不提早結束，十七日考試之後，仍可再繼續上課兩星期，以補充學識。</p>
<p>可照百分之五十保送入國大</p>
<p>對於先修班學生升學辦法，謂參照後方先修班學生升學辦法，同樣辦理，（後方學生入學一學期者，考升百分之二十五，入學已滿兩學期者，考升百分之五十），（查該班因功課加緊，前已舉行第一期考試，現至五月底結束，故可照老升百分之五十辦法辦理），的可照百分之五十保送升入國立大學，惟文科學生主要幾門科目考分，須在七十分以上，理科學生數理化主要科目考分，須在七十分以上，方有保送升學資格。杭次長訓話畢，各生一致表示感謝，杭次長愛護學生之盛意，全饉向杭次長致最敬體而做。（晨）</p>

<h3>銀根鬆動實銷旺盛　金市買風復熾　配價提高爲一六七</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以隔前銀樓賞銷，迄晚越見猖狂，時局關係，人心易於浮動，銀根鬆動，外埠金價均高於本市頗多，買風復熾，查晨開即因銀樓方面抵補缺額，穿出一六大關，各色游資湧來，開後即告步昇，十時左右曾迫近一七關，遭多方出籠，及中行壓力而回頭，回降至一六七萬左右，中行即以是價配給同業七〇一條，迨配售竣事後，投機作風又起，股票方面亦有抵補，近午步漲至一七二萬弱，始見回風，多顯震於中行壓力，一部份獲利了結，午刻回落至一六八萬光景，午後津帮套買仍股，最後仍屹立一七〇萬關外，結果較前收漲起十二萬五，飾金掛十八萬三，紋銀銀元均平，息價銀根稱形鬆濫，暗息退至一角半至一角八分。</p>
<p>美鈔純受金價激動，亦步亦趨，自晨開二二一〇元逐漸步小組長至二三五〇元，午刻回跌至二三〇〇元內，爲被動之故，套頭拔開至七三五元以上，午後仍被金價帶上少許，結果較前收好起一二〇元，港票情形飄忽，籌碼有限，中途曾升至四二〇元以上，結果回好二十元，港匯四一五元至四二五元，羅比五二五元均有成交。</p>
<h3>紗綫一致喊高　現棉交易減色</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉趨穩定，緣金市忽吿上升，刺激人心不少，晨初各支紗綫一致喊高，尤以四十二支雙股綫，因隔昨紡建公司掛牌，毫無供售，同行心思陡高，藍鳳曾做開一百九十三四萬，收市稍形回一下三萬，然仍較昨日漲起十萬之之譜，其餘如廿支約升一萬，十六支升二萬，成交殊尠。</p>
<p>昨日紐的美棉電訊報跌十二至廿九磅音，計近期美金二七·四〇，遠期二七·五三，米特林現貨二八·〇七，本埠現棉交易較爲减色，因週六關係，致黃金與紗布市况雖向榮，但廠家均存觀望，毫無問津消息，僅同業稍有點綴。</p>
<h3>紡建儘量拋售　人造絲價看疲　廠經綢貨均漲</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲因紡建公司開貨關係，市塲內全日未做價，塲外一二〇號天橋喊一百三十三萬元，中紡開貨價，一二〇號孔雀地球一百〇七萬元，一二〇銀鳥一百十二萬元，一五〇號金三馬一百廿一萬元，有光與半光價同，二百餘家人絲號，共開出六百餘箱，據說每逢星期六，中紡公司開貨一次，此後人絲市價，恐難看好，廠經交易無多，因金價上升，以致用戶絲均喊高五萬元左右，綢貨昨市頗形活躍，大誠格子璧縐，每碼漲起一百元，美亞被面，每百條亦好一二萬元。</p>
<h3>菸葉來源大暢</h3>

<h3>茶市交易見减</h3>
<p>杭州新旗槍邇來天津帮復有垂靑之意，並爲便利選擇起見，聞該帮客商不日即將赴產區吸收，至於溫州旗槍，到源依然絡繹，惜品質日見低次，故市勢續呈不支，刻下每担跌近十四萬元，但尙有一部份貨主亟謀出籠，因此在十二三萬元亦有賣出，其他花色自各方買氣連綿進展以來，均達相當程度，是以問津者較形减落，然持者心思不餒，故其底盤仍堅穩。</p>
<h3>公債逐步盤跌　股票元氣大傷</h3>
<p>公債市况恍惚，高價時經一部份金融界存貨放出，大戶翻身放手，開後統丙自七五五〇元後逐步盤跌，北帮游資趨往黃金，中途破六五〇〇元關，而後始漸盤旋，較前收回降四百元，甲乙跌五五〇元，丁種跌六百元，戊種跌六百五，華股驚弓之烏，原氣一時難以恢復，加之金市浮動，游資星散，初開時尙現秀氣，永紗五三八〇元，美亞四五〇〇元，景福三七五，新光三一五元，勤興二八〇元後即告不支，近午永紗跌至四九〇〇元，美亞四〇五〇元，景福三四〇元，新光二八五元，勤興二四〇元，稱雄數日之榮豐，自一三四〇元亦感難支，下降半成結束，午收疲後微回，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福新光各跌半成，勤興則跌一成弱，冷門各股除小型者尙平，餘均微挫，外股完全與華股同化，怡紗初時布前收價以上掙扎，證劵帮無力主持，熱股首吿潰散，冷股亦被帶小，近午都現低價，結果較前收各股均跌半成左右，紙業旣冷几霉，一經持有者急於脫手，市價立降二成弱。</p>
<h3>棉布業與紡建　商定改善辦法　明日起照常開貨</h3>
<p>棉布業市塲，昨日照常開做，紡建昨日本爲開售布疋之期，但雖照常掛牌，並無布商前往訂開，據棉布公會消息，其負責人昨曾與紡建負責人繼續商談，洽定（一）開貨力求普及與公允，紡建當即編製統計，隨時參考，以期分配適當，（二）收單時間，酌量延長，以免趕辦不及，（三）開貨配貨處添加人手，務予顧客以便利，（四）存貨管理，設法集中，使供求計算敏捷得當，（五）稅單遲慢，及數戶合簽一單之弊，由紡建轉向貨物稅局交涉改善，（六）開貨手續，當求不斷的改進，公會與紡建雙方之負責人，今後保持聯絡，依此商談結果，公會已出通告知照各會員，定於星期一即十三日起，恢復紡建開化同，聞公會方面，一部份理事表示辭意，將成事實，至於紡建經銷處計　，亦將由公會策動組織，將來擬與全　同業及經紀人以業務上之便利，以期利益均沾。</p>
<h3>加拿大對外貸款　我佔六千萬</h3>
<p>〔路透社渥太華十一日電〕據美元中（英國不在內），中國佔一有六千萬美元，關於貸款之數額期限等，列表發下：（單位百萬美元）</p>
<h3>世界金銀價格動向　美國當局雖竭力阻止上漲　但衆信或收追隨，方市塲</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕據路透社訪員著論稱，此間消息靈通之金業界人士堅信英鎊及美元對黃金及白銀之價格，必向歐洲及東方之較高水準上漲，尤以白銀爲顯著，就黃金而言，一旦漲價，即爲英鎊及美元之貶値，英美當局尙無採取此項措置之跡象，美國金價規定爲每盎司三十五元，同時英鎊對美元匯率，亦有規定，故英鎊對黃金價格一七二先令三辨士，除略有調整外，顯然不能上漲。</p>
<p>美國財政部反對提高金價，或能制止其他各地之此種趨勢，但至美國遭逢其未來之不景氣，（多數觀察家認爲僅係時間問題），惟恐目前之通貨膨脹將一變而爲通貨緊縮時，則情形或將迥不相同，與布里敦森林貨幣協定有關之美國財政部某高級官員亦反對提高金價，其理由爲「美國財政部相信美元對黃金之未來變動，應以布里敦森林協所規定之原則爲根據」，而並非以金價不應有何變動爲理由，目前倫敦白銀之官價雖規定爲每盎司四十四辨士，而其「自由市塲」價格則爲每盎司五十八辨士至六十辨士，最近自由價格曾達每盎司六十八辨士之高峯，雖尙未達柬方水準，然觀其上漲之勢，爲期當不遠矣。</p>
<h3>最輕呢絨　每碼僅重一兩</h3>
<p>英國新聞處倫敦十一日電，倫敦一廠商製造一種最輕毛織物，每碼僅重一兩。由李茲硏究工作人員發明：應用一海藻構成之綫作爲引綫，與純羊毛疊摺一起；此海藻引綫溶解於淡性鹼溶液中，織成後，一經洗濯，即留下最純粹之毛織品。由此新法構成之毛織品，其下垂性，結構，與形式堪稱空前優美，前途發展不可預計，惜目前產量不多，尙不能出口。</p>

<h3>人心愈慌需求愈切　米價連漲不已　升斗小民何以爲活！　糧貸聞決定暫作結束</h3>
<p>昨日米市銷化甚活，供不應求，粳秈元米均續升二三千元不一，已迫近五大關，麵粉汕頭厦門納胃頗暢，飛漲二千元，黃豆亦以閩浙均有問津，價升二千餘元，豆餅客帮南洋進取，亦漲五六百元，麩皮鄉銷頗活，續升四五百元，生仁亦加千元，赤豆香港動而不旺，價漲千元，紅糧升千元，油市本街進胃頗旺，兼之甬帮問津，再升二千餘元，昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，共二千七百餘石，其種類及石數如下：白粳一二一〇，羊秈二四五，薄稻四二五，杜秈三八八，早稻四四三。</p>
<p>又訊，京滬綫產米區之崑山·蘇州·常熟·無錫等各地，因有徵收軍糧限制食米出境之舉，致激起本市米市之動盪，昨日曾突破五萬元大關，糧食部次長龐松舟氏特專程由京來滬，召集糧食商議定穩定糧價之緊急措施，先由招商局派巨型運輸輸前往越南裝運洋米二十萬噸來滬，同時准許豆米業公會憑發給之證明書，向京滬產米區自由採購，並以採購之米糧限在市塲公開拋售，聞首期糧貸米三萬祖，業已運滬，現於昨晨派售五千担，連上次已售出之九千担，合爲一萬四千祖，其餘將陸續拋售，此期糧貸米決暫作結束，貸款全部收回，以免引起誤會，至糧貸米所獲盈餘利潤，如何分配，則尙待商會考慮決定。</p>
<p>前傳四馬路靑蓮閣米市塲將恢復南北市交易之說，據米市場息，事實上一時尙無改變可能，因南北兩米市塲在戰前係江蘇省之無錫·常州·蘇州·崑山等米產區，運滬集中販賣區，已被日敵砲火破壞，一時不易修築恢復原狀云。</p>

<h3>貨物稅與營養稅問題　江蘇區貨物稅局之解釋</h3>
<p>逕啓者，頃閱貴報本月六日登載諸尙一先生所撰染織業之貨物稅與營業稅問題一文，對於稅法原理，闡述精詳，足祛羣疑，惟本文末段，關於現行棉紗統稅稽徵情形，以及出口報關辦法，與事實略有出入之處，敝局職司榷政，難安械默，茲據章則規定略述如次：</p>
<p>（一）現行棉紗統稅本係以棉紗爲徵課對象，於出廠時依照核定統稅價計徵，棉布一項，原在免徵之列，惟因規模較大之紗廠，恒附有織布間，所用原料，均取給於本廠，此項織布之紗，旣未移出廠外，按照出廠稅之原則，即不應予以課證，是以現行棉紗統稅稽徵章程規定，凡紗廠附有織布間者，其棉紗由紡紗間移送織布問時，暫不徵收統稅，俟製成織品，裝包出廠，再行就織品補徵統稅，其計稅標準，亦經規定，按其所含紗支重量，分別從價徵收，各稅務機構歷來均照定章辦理，向無額外課徵情事，惟爲貨照相符起見，故於所給稅照品名欄內，塡寫棉布字樣，一般人遂誤爲徵收棉布統稅，不知實係補徵紗稅也，至單純織廠所出織品，其原料旣係採用已稅棉紗，亦經定有單純織廠棉紗直接織成品換領述照辦法，准憑原棉紗完稅照，或分運照，按可能產製織成品數量，換領單純織廠棉紗直接織成品運照，藉憑運輸，並不收費，亦從無另徵棉布統稅情事。</p>
<p>（二）各廠所製織品稽徵給照辦法，已如前述，則凡持有此項貨品者，自應憑照隨運，出口報關時，亦同，凡係整批報運者，可即呈騐原稅照或運照，如係分批改運者，可持憑原稅照或運照，先向當地稅務機關申請發給分運照，（分遝照辦法現尙照舊）再行呈請核騐，惟報運地點，必須與照上所塡運達地點相符，以免兩歧，此項辦法，行之有年，尙無不便處。</p>
<p>以上兩端，爲現行棉紗統稅法令中關於棉布之實際情形，與諸君文內所得自傳聞者、多有不符，恐閱者不察，致滋誤會，特爲專函辨正敬希貴報於來函欄內代爲刋登，俾明眞相，至深公感。</p>

<p>正如台北省立博物院裏，所陳列着的，台北市在過去的五十年前還是一個荒涼的市集，在滿淸末葉，市區都是純中國南方土着的建築，泥道，瓦礫，可是五十年後，台北却一躍而爲現代化的新型都市。這中間，從古老的都市蛻變爲時代的驕子，其發展的軌跡是可以追尋的。百二十年前，台灣流行的俗諺是：「一府二鹿三艋」，這是說最繁華的是台南府，其次是鹿港，再次是艋甲。」艋甲，這倚靠着淡水河的船隻集散地，台北市萬華，現在還遺留着蒼老的影子。人們打市區裏蹓躂，可以在寬暢的柏汕馬路的盡頭，瞥見給檳榔樹圍着的城牆，那是淸光緒元年欽差大臣沈葆楨奏議將台灣府自台中移到台北時，至四年知府陳星聚募集了二十萬兩銀子，費時二年才吿竣工的城壁的遺址，一里的週圍給日本人拆建了寬敞的馬路，如今四個城門——景福門（東門）麗正門（南門）承恩門）北門）重熙門（小南門）乃在五月的風浮動着帶笑的面影，日本人決沒想到這個觸動民族心情的紀念碑，會掀起了抗戰的巨浪，</p>
<p>記者訪問了本地的老者，他頻頻訴說五十一年前的往事，更揮淚追述漫漫長夜裏所受的苦難。他只要一闔眼，就像站在年靑時看見的知府的面前，紅纓帽，胸前的項串，朝服，端祥的威嚴的臉龐。他愛看升堂，審訊犯人，而在出衙門時的大鼓大　掮旗打傘扛着大轎走過時，他也愛瞧着那風景。</p>
<p>他在三十年前到過日本，也到過國內上海，南京，香港各地，他不信實中國的科學不及他們那時，不過因爲內亂關係，敎育不能普及而已。五十年的淪陷期中，日本人對於本省人待遇上的差別，使他感到最大的痛苦，除了盡忠個人的職責外，不幫忙，不問外事。六百萬的人們，都像是啞子，在高壓的統制之下，有苦無處訴，有話不能說。他說：日本人在台灣，只是用强行的手段，匪徒的資格來建設，軍閥奸黨把他們的祖國都葬送了。要是再不放棄　國主義，仍是覇道包心，暴性難改，即令二十年後還是難能復興的。</p>
<p>對於現實做了五十年的啞子，現在開口的老人說：草創時期，求周之處，在所不免，總之，處處君子，處處小人，本省人要是作放眼天地闊之想，又何必限於在台服務呢？他今年六十四歲，祖）籍漳州，是書香門第，能够背誦四書五經，也能寫純粹的文言。他說，本省人是不會忘記國語的，日本人在這裏推行了三十年的國語，始吿普及，但閩南話仍取消不了，即以本人而論，到內地時，學了六個月國語，隔了一二十年，現在溫故知新，也强能應付。</p>
<p>在古城牆下，我們發見了眞正的懷念故國之士，他們以眼淚渡過年靑的歲月，第二代的人似乎把他們遣忘了。但記者想，對於尊敬年老者的爭取和共鳴，是必要的，只有他們最理解本國，也最理解台灣，蒼勁的影子正是現地所留的僅存的元氣。</p>
<h3>台北夜笛</h3>
<p>— 本報航訊　駐台特派員暮雲</p>
<p>台北市的夜，恰和白晝相反，帶有初秋的凉意的。室內，蟄居在斗室裏，可以嗅到苿莉花，八月的桂花的香味。在靜寂的街頭，你可以聽到榮有日本人習俗的木屐的音節，偶而混雜着短笛的拿龍者（即按摩）的夜唱，那聲調動人心魄，他會撩起飄洋過海之旅者的懷鄕病，他們是在生活的邊緣上，找尋明天的食糧的男女盲者。</p>
<p>控制着台北的經濟命脈的鬧街是大稻堤（現在的延平路一帶），華燈初上，酒樓的猜拳行令聲，雜着在生活壓榨下的女人的在笑，飄揚過來，人們會將一天所有的收人，作所能換一次歡笑的代價；不是這樣，就上三家舞廳以三十元跳十隻舞的代價，摟抱着着着頎長旗袍的本地舞孃的腰。來自內地的人們說，到台灣來太悶了，經濟基礎不能建立，生活也感到恐憐，事業沒有前途，還不如找一點刺激吧。有五十個以上的舞女，成萬的侍女，却爲了生活的重祖强作半買笑的生涯。夜的畸形的繁榮成長了，像在戰時瘋在的情景一樣。</p>
<p>實際上最具有神秘和誘惑性的是艋甲。艋甲過去是載運樟腦。茶和其他土產品的戎克船的集散地，高突的帆檣，往來的客商，交織成這傍着淡河河邊的市街的繁華面。這裏是漢籍福建漳州泉州人的大本營，艋甲的外衣，披着閃耀誘人的神秘的色調，可是在底層，却洋溢着純中國式的古老味。在裏街，矮小的南中國式的鴿籠裏，他和她們所信奉的神佛，有著名的龍山寺祖師廟，天后宮的媽祖廟等，終年的香火是不絕的。在深夜黯淡的電燈下，你可以看到拖着木屐提着　包愁眉苦笑的少女，懶洋洋地歸來的背影，同時你也可發現漏夜趕廟的焚香點燭虔誠叩拜的善男信女；尤其能山寺，是乾隆三年所建的名剎，它成了本省人精神所寄之處。初來此處，幾使你難能信實，這裏已經開江南千餘里的海外，因爲情調正和蘇州的玄妙觀，上海的城隍廟並無異樣。</p>
<p>在這裏徘徊，你會信實這是中華民族深沉的潛在力的表現罷！日本人統治了台灣這些年，他榨去了島民的血肉，但他仍沒有奪去他們的心。在生活樣式和房舍的古老上，又使人感到日本人對於本省人，是多麽的軒輊啊！</p>
<p>在能山寺近淡水河畔一帶的區域裏，夏天是一個絕好的納凉處所，你可以呌隻船，在河裏蕩漾迎着夜的凉風，讓都市的喧雜放開去。可是如今儘多的賣笑的娼妓，在夜的黑幕裏，候着我尋肉體安慰的人。有成千以上的本地女子，現在正處在生活的鐵鞭下私底裏賣弄色情。她們散處在低矮的屋角裏，過往留着風流的殘痕日本藝妓之家……</p>
<p>肓者的短笛在輪流地吹奏着，像除夜小唱似的，凄淸的調子吐訴着高度生活的哀怨，古中國的人們，正渴待着光復後的天明！天明！</p>
<h3>產糧區域拿青菜當飯！　湘糧荒益趨嚴重</h3>
<p>— 本報長沙一日通訊　特派員高元禮</p>
<p>湘災嚴重情形，記者曾數度向讀者報吿，乃日來長沙糧價每石竟陸漲二萬元，引起社會騷動，而各縣情形更變本加厲，致人民被逼投河自縊者，時有所聞。即產糧區域之常德，亦以靑菜當飯，城內飢民充斥，形勢慘重，若不迅予有效救濟，勢將不可收拾，</p>
<p>如意算盤　打得不夠正確</p>
<p>湖南糧食嚴重情形，雖早爲各方所家視，但本着靠天吃飯的精神，一直沒有拿出切實的辦法來。三月中旬到四月中句，這一個月中間，幸而糧價還平穩，而且又下過幾次雨，河水又漲了幾尺，米價始終維持在二萬入九千元上下，沒有超過二萬元，所以大家心裏都輕鬆一下。前任主席吳奇偉由重慶回來帶來了川贛餘糧四十萬石濟湘的消息，而且又請准四聯總處發湘糧貸五億元，農貸十億元，再加軍糧徵購價格提高，這一串好消息，大家都以爲有辦法，不要緊，糧價會跌的。於是大家都等，等到川贛餘糧運到，問題就解決了。那知道如意算盤打得不好，糧價在三天的期間發生劇烈的波動，鬧得社會騷然，輕鬆了一月的人們心裏，又壓上一塊大石頭。</p>
<p>四月十五日一日間米價由二萬八千元漲到三萬二千元一石，一天漲了四千元。可是十六日又漲四五千元，十七日更不得了，跳過四萬，十八·十九兩天，情形更壞，到了四萬八，三四天的光景，幾乎漲了一倍，貧民在哭，社會在動，報紙在喊。</p>
<p>市參議會　情願遏止漲風</p>
<p>在漲風最厲害的時候，長沙市參議會首先發動向省府請願，要求設法遏止漲風，幷建議調查本市倉存數量，請求辦平糶，第一個辦法被常局採納，立即會同有關方面和米業的代表挨戶調查。但調查的結果，畏沙市內倉庫存的穀米，不過五萬石左右，只能供全市人民三四天的消費。這證明存底確不多，而來源方面又受運輸的限制，不能暢達。第二個辦法，是交人民糧食公司舉辦平糶，當然只要辦，總比不辦好些。可是籌備父需時，鬧了半個月才開始，每人每日購米五升，價錢照市價九折，即每升三百六十元。</p>
<p>在市參議員請願後，中央社所發出的新聞，說長沙糧價暴漲，是有「某特殊勢力人物」在市內收購大批穀米南運，致刺激糧價，中央日報亦有同樣紀載，而大公報十七日社論，以「官僚資本操縱米價」爲題，亦稱：近日「某巨公之第」與本市糧商來往頻繁，進行收購糧食五萬石南運，於是由此「特殊勢力人物」及「某巨公之第」而引起社會騷然，似乎其中有人，呼之欲出，平民則對此「特殊勢力人物」及「某巨公之弟」相驚佔有。</p>
<p>收購米糧　省府令　密查</p>
<p>省府主席吳奇偉廿日曾舉行一次記者招待會，專談糧食問題，各廳處長除財廳長兼省田糧處長楊銳靈氏未到外，其餘均出席。楊銳靈氏派田糧處副處長陶重周來代表。吳主席報吿省府對糧價問題的揹施，首先提到軍糧的收購，及救濟糧荒的辦法，結論還是搶運川糧。</p>
<p>田糧處副處長陶重周在招待會中成爲重矢之的，質問紛來。陶氏大有應付不暇之勢。陶氏說此次糧價暴漲，實出意外，幷稱預計不久還有漲的可能。有人問他這次漲價，事前旣不知道，情有可原，現在旣曉得將來還要漲，田糧處是否有妥善的辦法？陶氏以「事關機密」四字答覆過去了。</p>
<p>關於所謂「特殊勢力人物」問題，前主席曾提及，謂各報含沙射影，希望能提出事實，以便嚴懲。當天曾經通令各有關機關密查，所謂「特殊勢力人物」收購米糧價相，限三日內具報。可是三天期滿後，還是無下落，而米價則還在漲，廿三日已到五萬元了。</p>
<p>這樣的漲法，長沙受不了，各縣也受不了，漲風蔓延之快，超過一切紀錄，衡陽七萬，常德五萬五，常德還是產米區。價格如此之高，其他各地更可想而見。</p>
<p>平心靜氣的說湖南糧食自然是有無的關係居多，而人爲的關係確也不少。單以長沙湘潭兩地鄕下爲例：鄕下的穀價都是十八元現洋一石（現洋每元合法幣一千元），而且還買不到，這是千真萬確的事實。證明產量確不够消費，可是人爲的呢，那原因就多了。</p>
<p>縣級辦法　奉行不甚澈底</p>
<p>徵購軍糧，中央已規定以三月十五日平均價計算，湖南定的價是一萬二千元，本來老百姓無話說，又是籌購軍糧的田糧處因爲以前代購軍糧熱了許多錢，都在新價裏扣回，所以實際發下去的不到一萬二千元。再加上縣級，幾次轉手，老百姓實際所得，距離規定的更遠。於是不賣就押人，許多鄉民就這樣被逼得自殺投河。微購的辦法，縣級奉行不澈底，反映政令不行，原頒辦法是隨賦徵購，後來修改爲以大戶爲對象，當然是有田產的人才有資格，可是到了縣級，實質就有改變，縣政府把辦法改了，不分貧賤富貴，一律平均，可憐的是那些窮無立維的，也被攤派，三升五升也要，逼得窮人賣兒賣女買米來繳，弄得怨聲載道，自然生活日高，糧價就不能不漲，這是人爲的原因之一。</p>
<p>以榮代飯　省下來作軍糧</p>
<p>常德本是產米區，近來情形亦很惡劣，全縣派購軍糧十二萬石，以致蓋藏空虛，官無積穀，民無存糧，省田糧處還令縣政府運米二十五萬斤至芷江，又令以六十萬斤供應過境的第五軍，於是城鄕家家派糧，戶戶催糧，雖是攤販，亦不免　派。專員縣長都下鄉催收，全縣沸騰，軍隊要吃，吾則就要餓飯，石公橋，德山河洑等地的人民，十有九家都吃靑菜當飯，把米省下來供應軍隊，再以春旱無雨，無法插秧，爭水打架，無米自殺的事，遍地皆是。</p>
<p>政治救災　重於物資救災</p>
<p>這都是人爲的，所以政治救災在湖南還比物資救災更重要，湘救濟分署副署長姚雪懷先生陪同聯總駐湘主任霍夫曼及生活時代雜誌記者等，赴各縣視察回長對記者說：一部份人憑借特殊勢力，多方勾結，勒買糧食，操縱漁利，以致刺激糧價，基層政治不良，大礙救災，許多保甲長，不顧人民災不災，不正當捐派，勒迫無已，因此，姚氏强調政治救災的重要性，認爲政治上不想辦法，物資雖多，亦無濟於事。</p>
<p>公平的負祖，和公平的分配，在湖南現况上急切需要，任何事情不要再玩手法，切切實實的做，才會有辦法。四聯總處發給湖南的糧貸五萬萬元，省政府曾級織一個湖南省民食調劑委員會來運用，但四聯將以前貸給長沙衡陽兩縣的二億元扣還，所以實際上只有三億，我們確不明瞭四聯總處是何道理，未免算盤太精一點。</p>
<p>湖南省民食調劑委員會成立將近兩月，運用的資金雖有三億元，惟因長沙四聯分處還在請示借款辦法，迄今尙未借到，實際運用的還是卅四年度公務員生活補助費餘款兩億元，所以未收大效</p>
<h3>香港文化壁壘</h3>
<p>— 本報香港八日航訊　特約記者林友蘭</p>
<p>香港文化界，包括各方人物，且所處環境特殊，故其表現，也就相當複雜，頗値一談。最近港澳總支部主委李大超招待新聞界的席上，華字日報代表發見香港淪陷期內曾經附敵的華僑日報主持人亦同被邀參加，立刻拂袖而去，以示抗議。這是香港文化界中最近的一個風波，這個風波的幕後，便有一篇故事：</p>
<p>華僑日報搖身　變</p>
<p>華僑日報是日本投降後，以歌頌日寇　　政府的面目，搖身一變而恭維盟軍愛護祖國的唯一的港報。曾在香港淪陷時期內出版，至今仍繼續存在的報紙，其實不祇華僑日報一家。最顯著的還有星島日報（即日本佔領期內的香島日報），但其發行人年前已遄返祖國，戰後兼程叫港。一般人體念他蓄意改革，對他的過去，似不願過分追究。</p>
<p>忠奸有別　經渭分明</p>
<p>自中宣部的國民日報出版後，香港才有一份正義昭彰的報紙。今春工商日報揭櫫「忍受四年犧牲，保持廿載光榮」的口號復版。正義的大　，一時聲勢頓增。忠奸之別，涇渭分明。華僑日報相形之下，不寒而栗</p>
<p>抓住弱點　肆無忌憚</p>
<p>華僑日報為挽回頹勢，一面支持循環日報（香港渝陷初期改稱「循環日報（香港渝陷初期改稱「東亞晚報」出版）復刊，引爲朋類，互相呼應。一面新辦香港郵報，別開生面，預謀萬一的退路。同時四出拉攏，廣結善緣，對英人則善頌善禱，對祖國則故作體順，曲意關懷。我駐港當局在香港特殊環境下，尊重友邦法律，米能發揮充分的力量。華僑日報抓住這點，益無顧忌，暢所欲爲，幷利用黨國要員的題字作幌子，愚惑僑胞。</p>
<p>大放空氣　進行改組</p>
<p>華字日報本月十五日始告複版，　然以反奸工作自任。發行不久，即著論主張懲辦華僑目報主持人岑某，幷其呈粵省黨政軍及有關方面，請求嚴辦。華僑日報見勢不佳，最近聘回戰前的總編輯張某，放出進行改組內部的空氣，就在這個期間，李主委忽招待新聞界茶會，華僑日報亦在被邀之列，遂促成華字日報抗議的一幕。到底我當局如何處置附敵的華僑日報，是目前此間文化界所注視着的。</p>
<p>兩個壁壘不相往來</p>
<p>最近有一個從國內來港的記者，出席一個香港文化界的聯誼會發覺會中人寥寥可數，不禁訝問道：「香港的文化人爲什麽那麽少？」這個記者不知道香港文化界的內幕。上面談到的「忠奸之分」，旣把文化界割作兩個鮮明的壁壘，彼此怒目而視，不相往來。</p>
<p>左派方面　高視闊步</p>
<p>還有曰若干左派人士，自詡前進，高視闊步，好像除了認蘇聯為自已的國家的同志外，誰個都是他們的敵人。這種態度，自然無法和衷共濟，相叙一堂。因此，英軍重人香港，已逾半載，香港的文化界還未有什麽具體的工作表現。即一個新聞記者公會也無從組成。</p>
<p>加緊團結反對冷淡</p>
<p>今後，香港文化界如何團結起米，以盡其對國家</p>
<p>香港僑胞，大多一意經商，其中若干人士，且以不談政治爲淸高。因此，對政府的話，往往不聞不問，而對反政府者却隨聲附和，不辨是非</p>
<p>黃色小報故態復明</p>
<p>在以謾駡爲任務以挑撥為能事的左派報紙外，尚有一種專談風月誨淫誨盜的黃色小報。目前在香港，眞正能够經濟自足的，也是那些小報。上月港當局以其「有傷風化」，傳訊七家黃色報紙，給予嚴重警吿，但牠們的負責人，出了官門，便又故態復萌，報上色情文字，迄未改易半個。一般僑胞亦多沉溺於那些風月鑑中。香港文化界現已充滿各種毒素，至於如何肅淸那些一毒素，當然値得大家加以考慮，</p>
<p>教育機關陷於停頓</p>
<p>香港經過日寇三年零八個月的統治，社會風氣，日趨下流，敎育機關，完全停頓。成人厚顏無恥，競逐功利。兒童失學，以通環國，代替課本。光復以來，百廢待興，文化社</p>
<p>團和僑校的復員，尙未達到完善的境地。誰都期望着香港文化運動，該有一個猛進的姿態。</p>
<h3>參觀日俘修路　四十公里工程全部完竣</h3>
<p>— 五月六日南京通訊　魏望</p>
<p>日本投降以後，留在南京的徒一手官兵也有幾萬人，他們曾經慘殺過中闕人，同時也破壞了首都的建設。這次讓他們來修復這些破壞的建設，並不算苛待他們，這是一種公平的懲罰。市政府工務局目去年十一月起，即計劃興修城外城內各馬路，人力方面，則利用徒手日本兵俘，並由市府供給財力、陸軍總部負責物力，工務局以人力，財力，物力之强硬，開始興修城外環城馬路，即由中央門至燕子磯，燕子磯至堯化門，堯化門至太平門，燕子磯至下關寳塔橋。城內則由陸部軍至光華門外飛機塲，及中山路明故宮機塲修理廠附設之美軍停車塲，市中心區之漢中路，莫愁路，全畏計四十公里，已全部完工。市工務同特招待新聞界，由市府出發，出太平門參觀完成馬路之修築成績。</p>
<p>防止坍潰　路　栽種小草</p>
<p>天氣是陰沉沉的，帶着細濛濛的低霧，車子進行在大野裏。車的速度在柔和的春風裏，唱着爽快的調子前進。</p>
<p>無邊際的麥田，襯着淸淸的小溪，靑灰色的山崖，上面有一百名以上的日俘在工作，穿淺黃色的侵略外套，扛着工具，爲受害者開闢坦道。一路上車身平穩，用黃沙泥舖成的路面，只與柏油稍差一些的光滑，大家都認爲相當滿意。到燕子磯時，由日俘工務處主任戴根法解釋稱：所有日俘修築之路，相當究好，日俘工作也頗賣力，為了防止路基坍潰，並於路邊栽種小草。對我長官之指揮，則唯命是從。</p>
<p>指示修路　市長親自監導</p>
<p>燕子磯參觀完畢，即啓程赴下關一段參觀。沿山十二洞，是名勝，是風景區，這一路更形平坦。路的北邊是長江，南邊是高山重岩，路的近旁是靑綠色的石榴樹和櫻桃林”野香撲鼻，沒有灰塵的大道，遊春於此，也該暢爽胸懷吧。</p>
<p>寳塔橋回來後，至燕子磯，路上遇見馬市長偕同前進。馬市長指示路基應行修改之處，及下水道之疏通等。</p>
<p>由燕子磯再往堯化門進行，路面有一段是石子舖成的，直至堯化門車站附近該地區的徐達墓，這一段路面甚佳，車行速度達三十米哩，氣候轉暖，日影射在身上，略有暖意，此段路很長，路面寬五公尺，計所有道路皆以四寸圓徑之石塊塡底，上舖碎石，再加沙泥而成，絕不會因雨而崩潰。十二時進太平門，直達勵志社進餐。</p>
<p>工程浩大　成績相當可觀</p>
<p>十二時半出勵志社出發，直奔光華門外飛機塲，該段路面係以水泥舖成，尤覺平坦舒適，繞回時又赴明故宮機場修理廠參觀美軍停車塲之修築，日俘的數百人，正加緊趕築中。</p>
<p>戴主任詳爲說明工作之效率，及完成後之堅固，遂復乘車直駛中山路工務處休息。及抵達工務處時，只剩了六名記者，後因奔波一天，頗感疲倦，擬往參觀漢中路，莫愁路及秦淮河一段，均告作罷。戴主任對這浩大工程稱：經費一億一千萬，動員日俘爲一萬二千名，幾個月內有此成績，各方對此頌詞頗多，可以吿慰。陸總部內之道路及下水道之修築，也正進行，日內當可完工。（當代社）</p>

<p>母親節特刊</p>
<h3>大母親</h3>
<p>— 嘉音</p>
<p>上海少年村在社會領袖與熱心人士的策動之下，已經逐漸成形，預料不久就可以建立起來了。</p>
<p>少年村的目標，在帮助沒有父母的孤兒，以及不能適應社會的少年，使他們能够長成起來，能够有一技之長，能够成為社會有用的一員。換一句話說，少年村如果實現的話，將成為上海的不幸兒童與少年的母親，也就是社會的大母親。</p>
<p>在這勝利後第一次母親節日，我們除了加倍地思念和感　我們自己的母親，以及世界上所有的好母親養育子女的辛勞之外，促成上海少年村——這社會的大母親的實現，實在也是一件極重要和有意義的工作。</p>
<p>少年的募款運動即將開始了，願大家踴躍贊助並參加這個有意義的運動。用帮助這個工作來紀念我們的母親，是最恰當不過的了。</p>
<h3>由母親節想起</h3>
<p>— 慕蕾</p>
<p>愛倫凱說過：「世界上最偉大的是母親。母愛如溫煦的陽光照臨於大地。」是的，母愛確是値得歌頌的，如果沒有母親把她的愛分給她的孩子們，那民族的新細胞的生命怕早就不能延續下去了。</p>
<p>假使我們相信二十世紀是兒童的世紀，那我們就得承認二十世紀的母親負着極深重的職責，兒童們的敎養責任，至少有大平要靠母親來擔當。幼苗嫩芽的生長和發育，完全要仰賴母親的灌溉。</p>
<p>我並不是說，父親對於敎養兒童可以不聞不問，把責任全都卸給孩子的母親，但母親和孩子接觸的時間最多，所給予孩子的影響也比較大。古今中外有不少名人，都是在良好的母敎黨陶感化之下而成功的。</p>
<p>我國父母敎育子女的態度，可以包括在「嚴爺慈母」這四個字裏。父親往往都是嚴厲的，而母親却多是慈祥的。有人說，在一緊一鬆的敎養之下，兒童可以在知能和品格方面得到適當的發展。我們常看到有些家庭，子女犯了規，或有不良的行為發生，做父親的總是用極嚴峻的　　對付他們，訶責訓斥不够，還要繼之以體罰，子女到了受不了的地步，做母親的便百般撫慰他，寬恕他。在母親以為自己的孩子受了懲罰，必須加以一番慰藉，這時孩子甚至以要挾的手段提出許多不合理的條件，而母親一概不加拒絕。剛才被父親打駡得哭了，馬上又被母親愛撫得笑了。這種一緊一鬆的敎育方法，普遍應用於一般家庭。</p>
<p>父母敎養子女的態度不一致，不但足以影響孩子的心理的健全發展，而且可能發生種種弊端，减少敎育的效果。從心理衛生的原則來說，父母對於子女應該時時保持適當的一致的態度，過嚴與過鬆都是不好的。孩子的可塑性和感受性很大，不良的暗示可以摧毀他們稚弱的心靈，危害他們的心理健康。常態的情緒生活，惟有在正常的環境中才能培養得出。我們不想信「嚴父慈母」是天經地義。嚴是需要的，但不應僅限於父親的嚴，母親也需要嚴；慈也是需要的，但不應僅限於母親的慈，父親也需要慈。嚴和慈並非兩個極端，父母雙方必須要做到「嚴而慈」和「慈而嚴」。嚴不一定就是一味嚴厲和冷酷，嚴應解釋為嚴正，公平，無私和有威信，父母敎育子女，重在以身作則，以威信和感情來感化，來誘導。一味放縱自然也不應該，必須要獎懲有度，緊鬆得宜。父母不應敎子女一見就怕，一見就避開，要敎子女望而生敬，見而生信。過去我國的一般父母，似乎忽略了這一些，父親常常代表着閻羅王，孩子不敢和他多接近，而做母親的又因為過於放鬆，編於溺愛，成為孩子心目中的蜜糖，然而並不一定就敬重她，不一定就聽從她的放在，這對於敎養子弟，有極不良的影響。</p>
<p>今天是母親節，我想乘機奉勸一般為母親者，要用你們適當的愛去培育子女的成長，不要一味的寬恕子女，要以嚴明公正的態度矯正你們子女不良的習慣和行為，促成他們健全身心的發展，不要掩飾自己子女的缺陷，不要和孩子的父親站在另一個極端而過度取悅於子女。切記着要和孩子的父親以一致的態度敎育子女。</p>

<p>當賈維斯發起孝母運動時，她還是一個美麗活潑的少女。不幸，她有一位盲目的妹妹文習諾，她為了要照顧那位可憐的妹妹，她拒絕了好幾位向她求婚的人，犧牲了她結婚生活的幸福。她的母親是美國西佛及尼亞州格雷夫頓城裏一位愛好花木，尤其是喜歡紅菊花的牧師的女兒。</p>
<p>約在五十年前，安娜的家搬到費城安娜的兄弟克拉特那裏去居住。幾年後，克拉特死了，遺下約七十萬元的財產，都是安娜姊妹兩人所得。不料，克拉特有些債主來瓜分，到去年，合部遺產都化為烏有。</p>
<p>一九〇五年五有月安娜的母親病故，她旣喪弟，又失母，此後她祇有一個盲妹相依為命了。這使她無限的悲痛。在她母親逝世二週年的忌辰，她在格雷夫頓敎堂禮拜時，宣布她為了世界上『被遺忘』的母親，準備發起一種運動。</p>
<p>她說：『母親們受苦多而享福少。她們健在時，子女偏偏不懂事，等到要想孝養她們時，她們却不在了。』</p>
<p>於是她在費城寫信給元首，州長，敎員，牧師等呼籲：</p>
<p>『每天固然都是孝敬我們母親的日子，但是為了表示崇高堅忍的愛，我們應該指定特別的一天。』</p>
<p>她的信立刻發生效力，名人如約瑟·但立爾，曾任總統的老羅斯福，煤油大王洛克費勒都回信響應了。</p>
<p>一九〇W入年基督敎長老會在西雅圖開會，規定會裏的牧師，以後每逢五月的第二個星期日，為母親們祝福。凡是母親健在的敎徒，寫信給老人家示愛請安；已故的，便佩帶白菊花誌哀。</p>
<p>一九一四年五月七日那一天，美國參議院一致通過了湯姆斯·希福林指定五月第二個星期日作為母親節的議案。五月九日威爾遜總統宣布母親節是『我們孝敬母親的公開表示。』</p>
<p>四十三國接受了母親節的建議。安娜看到她所創導的運動，有這樣廣大的成就，不禁驚喜交集。這一運動已展開到了世界的每一角落，但，免不了有些事情變了質。</p>
<p>『母親節』，她嘆了一口氣對訪她的新聞記者說，『被無知好利的人弄糟了，電報局編出現成的客套話，賣花商，糖菓店，印賀節卡的商人甚至隔壁的理髮匠都利用我的主意招徠，發財。一張印成的賀卡毫無意義，反表示了你的懶惰，懶得自己不肯親筆來寫信給母親，而你母親比世上任何人對你要好得多。糖！你帶了一盒回家給母親吃的，等一會，你自己吃掉了。不管你怎樣做，給她所缺乏和需要的東西吧！那便是我創導母親節的本意。』</p>
<p>她痛恨一切利用母親節來作生意經的宣傳與牟利。她曾因反對會塲中賣花，被指為破壞秩序而被提將官裏去。她於一九三四年到華盛頓譴責詹姆士·華萊不該發行母親節紀念郵票。</p>
<p>安娜眞是伶仃孤獨，幾乎與世隔絕。不過她的信任倒不算少。她約定一家剪報社，專剪寄報紙雜誌上關於她的消息。這樣到系統管理為，她的文件多得使她不得不買下隔壁的房子來推置。</p>
<p>一九四二年十一月一個嚴寒的日子，安娜踱進費城醫院診病，形容枯槁，視力喪失，而一貧如洗，晚景凄凉。</p>
<p>可憐的安娜直到風燭殘年才受着良好的照料。她不再跟賣花商糖菓商鬧蹩粗，而他們也正在捐款給安娜，賈維斯基金會。待她辭世後，人民會要求政府合造一所永久性的建築，來紀念這位犧牲心智，精神和幸福為母親節而奮鬥的人。</p>
<h3>母親節感言</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>今天又是一年一度的母親節。</p>
<p>一班知道今天是母親節，而又有機會或必須參加慶祝的，照例又是慶祝一番：演說，遊行，貼標語，有母親的簪朶紅花，沒了母親的戴朶白花。</p>
<p>我見一班人慶祝母親節，便想到一班人逢到自己母親生日，　母親做壽。</p>
<p>普通的人家總是備此酒菜，有錢的人家更要多請些客人，或是發些微文啓，倡和幾首壽母朝詩，不論母親平時的境况怎樣，她每年到了這一天，至少這一天，總被大家歡樂的慶祝着。</p>
<p>我看人家慶祝母親生日時，便記起孔子一句話來。</p>
<p>孔子曾說過：『父母之年，不可不知也：一則以喜，一則以懼。』</p>
<p>我不敢臆測：孔子這句話是為一班人慶祝父母生日而發，但我每見人慶祝母親生日，便會聯想到這句話。</p>
<p>我們在一班慶祝母親的生日賀語中，幾曾見到比這句更充滿摯情，幾曾見到比這句更流露孝思？</p>
<p>有幾個人，會在母親生日那天，因想到母親的高齡，而增加了他的孝思？同樣，有幾個人，肯在母親節那天，略看一看我國現代一班母親們的處境，而稍司到母親節的眞義？</p>
<p>在母親節這一天，請安詳的細看看自己母親的慈容吧，看看她那額上的層層鄒紋，記錄着含辛茹苦的經歷；頂上如銀的白髮，充滿了凄涼滄傷的回味：姑息的不和妯娌的　札，姑嫂間的糾紛，妻妾間的衝突，以及和子女的思想的矛盾，有的已漸成過去的史蹟，有的照樣在我們這一代中繼續的重演着，又增添了許多新的煩苦。</p>
<p>在慶祝母親生日時，應念到她的高齡，而增添孝思；在慶祝母親節這一天，我們應不應當環看一下國內一般做母親孝的境遇，而倍加勉勵，倍加警惕？</p>
<p>我們應當怎樣努力去改善一般做母親者的境遇，才對得住我們自己的母親？我們應當怎樣去改善一般做母親的境遇，才能更盡對子女的責任？</p>
<p>對母親要盡孝，做母親更要盡責。</p>
<p>每年在慶祝母親節時，對孝一方面曾得到多少安慰？在責一方面曾得到多少成就？</p>
<p>慶祝母親節是一件快樂的事，但最好再添一些警惕。像用『一則以喜，一則以懼』的心情來慶祝這母親節，也許母親節會變得更有意義一點。</p>

<h3>Zhou Enlai Answers Shao Lizi's Visit: Peaceful Negotiations Expected to Resume; Political Consultative Conference Subcommittee Meeting to Reopen Next Week</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Military Three-Person Committee did not convene today. Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai did not visit Ambassador Hurley all day, nor did they communicate by telephone. The only visitor to Ambassador Hurley this morning was General Yu Dawei. In the afternoon, two Associated Press reporters who had escaped from Changchun visited Ambassador Hurley. John Carter Vincent visited Zhou Enlai today, talking for about an hour. This morning at 9:00 AM, Shao Lizi visited Zhou Enlai but did not meet him. At 5:00 PM, Zhou visited Shao at his residence and had a general conversation. According to Shao, both the government and the Chinese Communist Party hope to continue negotiations and study a peace plan. Shao also told our reporter that three types of meetings may be convened next week (starting tomorrow): one is the KMT-CPC negotiation, one is the comprehensive subcommittee meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, and the other is the consultative subcommittee meeting of the Constitution Drafting Committee. The dates for these meetings have not yet been determined. It is also undecided whether the three meetings will be held simultaneously. The most important issue at present is the military problem. Without the Military Three-Person Committee, nothing can be agreed upon, and other issues will be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] News of an agreement to stop the conflict in northern Hubei has arrived here. The Peiping Executive Headquarters, which has been shrouded in a heavy atmosphere for the past week, has regained its harmonious air. Today, government officials commented on the northern Hubei incident, saying, "There was originally nothing to worry about." The Chinese Communist Party welcomed this agreement and hoped for its implementation. Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party, happily told reporters: "Although there are still crises and worries ahead of peace, the settlement in northern Hubei should be another new beginning for both sides to jointly seek a peaceful solution to general problems." However, in the reporter's observation, the solution of the Central Plains incident is only enough to extinguish the local flames of war. How to extinguish the flames of war between the White Mountains and Black Waters is the key to the current governance and chaos in China. Recently, the political takeover of the Northeast has been unable to proceed due to the problem of the Communist Party. On the military front, fierce and deadlocked warfare is underway. On the Changchun railway front, the government and the Chinese Communist Party's armies are still tug-of-war on the line from Sipingjie to Bamiancheng, and it is difficult for both sides to expect major progress. In the battle where the National Army entered Benxi southwest of Shenyang, many communist soldiers were annihilated. However, if they go deep into Andong along the Anfeng Line, it is difficult to predict whether there will be new changes internationally. Recently, in northern Manchuria, in addition to withdrawing its troops, the Soviet Union is also withdrawing its diplomatic railway personnel and overseas Chinese to the Soviet territory. What is the intention? It is worth paying attention to. In short, the Northeast problem must be clarified as soon as possible, otherwise, it may become more difficult to deal with. In North China, both sides are preparing for the worst, but there is no serious situation as rumored. Although the flowers in the Xiehe Hospital have bloomed with the arrival of spring, they no longer have bright colors, but the flowers and trees in the entire hospital are thriving. If there are no hailstorms or rainstorms in the next month or two, it will not be without results.</p>
<h3>John Carter Vincent Compares Himself to a Doctor, Wishing Both Sides to Implement the Agreement; The Communist Army in Hubei Requests to Transfer to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] (Delayed Arrival) After the Three-Person Committee returned to Hankou, they were too tired and had no substantial talks that night. It was not until 9:00 AM on the 10th that they continued their off-site negotiations. At 2:00 PM, Xu, Zhou, and Vincent resumed their formal meeting to re-discuss the demands raised by the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting lasted for about an hour. The three then met with reporters and issued an agreement document with a total of seven points, all of which were based on the one-sided demands of the Chinese Communist Party, which shows the government's painstaking efforts to make concessions and seek perfection. What is even more comforting to the people of the country is that the agreement only contains the words to stop "small-scale" battles and "outpost" conflicts, which is enough to show that the problems of the military and civilians in the Central Plains are not as serious as rumored. Subsequently, reporters asked the three about their impressions of this trip. Xu and Zhou were silent, while Vincent smiled and said, "My identity is like a doctor. It is really inappropriate to announce the patient's condition casually. What I can say is that I hope both sides will implement the agreement." After saying that, the three took a plane to Beijing.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] (Arrival) Wang Tianmu, Zhou Enlai, John Carter Vincent, and a group of more than fifty people including staff and reporters, went to Xuanhuaidian, the details are as follows: (1) Based on what they saw, the area was peaceful with little to no sign of conflict except for the communist forces pretending to be in a state of preparedness. (2) Although the Chinese Communists continued to exaggerate the severity of being transferred, and put forward various unwarranted demands, the negotiations were quite harmonious due to the greatest tolerance shown by the political representatives. (3) The Communist Party wanted the communist troops to be transferred to northern Jiangsu. Their reason was that after entering "their own area," conflicts could be avoided and peace could be achieved. (4) The special team remained in the area to continue the investigation.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in South of Benxihu New City is Underway</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Xinhua News Agency claimed that the war on the Benxi front is still continuing south of the Taizi River. Benxi has two cities, new and old. The old city is north of the Taizi River and is occupied by the National Army. The new city, also known as Miyahara, is south of the river and is still in the hands of the communist forces. The National Army is advancing towards the new city along the Anji Railway and on both sides, reaching the front of the Shilitou Railway Station south of the new city. The two armies are fighting fiercely. Sipingjie is still in stalemate for twenty-three days.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Army Headquarters Refutes Yan'an Radio Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The spokesperson of the Chinese Army Headquarters recently refuted the various sections mentioned in the Yan'an Radio broadcast on May 10 regarding the statistics of the National Army's movements after the ceasefire, saying that they were completely inconsistent with the facts. It is claimed that the movements of the National Army in the past were limited to taking over defense operations, and the Army Headquarters notified the Peiping Executive Headquarters each time. The broadcast claimed that the entire 73rd Army of the National Army was secretly airlifted to Jinan in March, which is even more absurd. The Communist Party specializes in fabricating rumors, which is obviously to cover up its own actions in violation of the ceasefire order. For example, in the Yan'an broadcast on May 9, it falsely claimed that the National Army destroyed the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. After investigation, it was found that this section has always been forcibly occupied by the communist forces, tightly blockaded, and obstructing traffic. It is unknown how the so-called destruction by the National Army came about.</p>
<h3>Repatriation of Japanese in the Northeast to be Handled by the US Military; Agreement Already Signed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 10th] Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Command, announced today that 1.3 million Japanese in the Northeast will be repatriated to their country through cooperation between the National Government and the US military. The repatriation agreement has been signed by Commander Du and US military representative Colonel Friedman in Shenyang. The repatriation is expected to be completed by September 30. A reporter asked how the Japanese in the communist-controlled areas, which account for about 70% of the Northeast, could leave the country. Friedman replied, "I have my own way." Friedman also said that at least 5,000 Japanese will be repatriated every day, first through Huludao, and then through Dalian and Yingkou. According to Chinese officials, there are 243,000 Japanese in Shenyang and 62,000 between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang. Those repatriated include military and civilians, but war criminals are not included.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 11th] All Japanese prisoners of war and expatriates in Guangdong and Hainan Island, except for 159 soldiers of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces detained in Hainan Island by the Central Government authorities, have been repatriated before the scheduled date. The total number of Japanese overseas Chinese and prisoners of war repatriated is approximately 120,000.</p>
<h3>Italian Overseas Chinese in Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao Request Permission to Return to Their Country</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 11th] The spokesperson of the Eleventh War Zone Command announced today that 3,000 Italian overseas Chinese residing in Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao have requested permission to return to their country. The Command has followed instructions and told them to wait for the investigation to be completed before further discussion. Regarding the issue of Japanese technicians, a meeting was held this morning, attended by the heads of all relevant departments. The results of the meeting were not announced, but it was emphasized that all Japanese technicians should be repatriated before May 5, and Japanese people in Shanxi must also leave the province before the end of June.</p>
<h3>Ma Hetian Arrives in Xi'an</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 11th] Ma Hetian, Commissioner of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and Special Envoy of the Chahar Mongolian Banner, flew here from Chongqing a few days ago. After a short stay, he will go to Peiping to deal with various matters concerning the Charhar Mongolian league. It is said that the Central Government has new policies for the Mongolian Banner.</p>
<h3>Change in Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs: Heads of Police Bureau in Six Counties Replaced</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 10th] The Department of Civil Affairs recently replaced the heads of the police bureaus in six counties: (1) Zhao Weiyi is now the head of the Suzhou Police Bureau; (2) Chen Yong is the head of the Jiangning Police Bureau; (3) Su Wenzhuang is the head of the Jiangdu Police Bureau; (4) Zhang Xingwu is the head of the Songjiang Police Bureau; (5) Mi Wucheng is the head of the Taicang Police Bureau; (6) Wu Ji is the head of the Rugao Police Bureau.</p>
<h3>Changes in Central Government Personnel; Gu Weijun and Fu Sinian to Head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education Respectively; Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun's Resignation Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is rumored that the National Government will soon announce a list of personnel changes. A Ministry of National Defense will be established, and Chairman Chiang will concurrently serve as the minister. It is rumored that the Chief of Staff of the ministry will be either He Yingqin or General Chen Cheng. However, it is said that Chen Cheng will replace Xiong Shihui as the chairman of the Northeast Campaign. Gu Weijun, the current Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, will be transferred to serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is expected that the president and vice president of the Executive Yuan will remain the same, but it is rumored that Fu Sinian will head the Ministry of Education, and Zhang Jia'ao will head the Ministry of Industry. The current Minister of Publicity, Wu Guozhen, will serve as the Mayor of Shanghai, and Zhang Daofan will serve as the Mayor of Nanjing. The former Mayor of Nanjing, Ma Chaojun, will be transferred to serve as the Mayor of Guangzhou. It is also rumored that the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, Pu Zhengdong, the Director of the Education Bureau, Gu Yuxiu, the Director of the Police Bureau, Xuan Tiewu, and the Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Chen Shiquan, have submitted their resignations to the authorities.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun's resignation has been approved. Wu Guozhen, the current Minister of Publicity, is the most likely candidate to succeed him. After Wu is transferred to serve as the Mayor of Shanghai, Peng Xuepei will succeed him as the Minister of Publicity. It is also said that Xuan Tiewu, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, will be transferred to a new position, and Li Shizhen, the principal of the police academy, is said to be the successor.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] In response to the rumor that he will head the Shanghai Municipality, Minister of Publicity Wu Guozhen replied to reporters with extremely humble words, saying, "This matter was mentioned last October, but I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to handle the responsibility because Shanghai is one of the world's metropolises and the economic center of our country, and the responsibility is great, so I did not dare to take on the blame rashly." Now, the Central Government believes that Wu has served as the Mayor of Hankou and Chongqing, has been diligent in administration and loves the people, and has a good reputation, and is considered appropriate by the Chairman and President Song.</p>
<h3>Chairman Hosts Tea Party for Representatives of Business Associations, Encouraging Assistance in Reconstruction and Promising to Find Ways to Solve Current Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Chairman Chiang hosted a tea party for representatives of business associations from all over the country at the Grand Hall of the National Government at 4:00 PM on the 11th. More than 50 representatives, including Wang Xiaolai, Lu Xiaobo, Wang Yizhai, Pan Yangshan, and Chen Zhimin, attended, as well as more than 20 government officials and provincial governors who were invited to accompany them. During the meeting, the representatives successively rose to report to the Chairman the various difficulties encountered by the industrial and commercial sectors in various places due to traffic obstructions, economic decline, hoping that the government would maintain and remedy them. After listening to the reports of the representatives, the Chairman made a reply, expressing his deep concern for the general difficulties felt by the current industrial and commercial sectors, promising to find ways to solve them, and encouraging the national industrial and commercial sectors to be good at adapting to the times, assisting the government in promoting post-war reconstruction work, and completing the great cause of nation-building. The situation was sincere and inspiring. In addition, the representatives of the business associations from various places, on the morning of the 11th at 9:00 AM, departed from the city business association, toured Yanziji and Xuanwu Lake, had lunch at Xuanwu Lake at noon, and visited Jiming Temple and other places in the afternoon. Some representatives also planned to host the Beijing press on the morning of the 12th to report on the current situation of industry and commerce in various places.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Chairman Chiang hosted a tea party for more than 50 representatives of the National Business Federation Preparatory Committee at the National Government at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th. After listening to the opinions of the representatives, he delivered a brief speech, which roughly stated: "The National Business Federation is holding a preparatory meeting in Beijing. From the perspective of the future of our Chinese business, this is really a major event. After the National Business Federation is established in the future, our national economic circles will have a central hub, which will be of great benefit to the prosperity of business and the development of industry in the future. As everyone knows, if we want to develop business, there is a prerequisite, which is to stabilize the local area and develop transportation. At present, the main reasons for the decline of China's economy and the decline of business are that transportation cannot be restored and the order of the local area cannot be stabilized. Just now, the representatives of Shandong and Henan provinces reported that the local people have suffered endless pain and losses in their lives and economy due to local unrest and traffic obstructions. This is what I am always concerned about, but this is a political issue, and the government will definitely do its best to seek a solution to the political issue and promote national stability and unity. At the same time, I hope that all business leaders will unite and assist the government to seek the prosperity and revitalization of China's economy. Only when the economy can be revitalized can the people's lives be improved, and the country can enter a state of prosperity and happiness."</p>

<h3>The Provisional Suspension of Food Tax Collection in Tongyao and Other Counties in Shaanxi Province: Tian Jiongjin Suggests to Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 11th] Tian Jiongjin, the supervisor of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, inspected Tong, Yao, Ning, Jing, Yuan, and Xian Counties a month ago. According to local gentry and people, the counties are urging the collection of last year's arrears of food, and the people are unable to pay. In addition, the price difference of Zhuanqian in Tong, Yao, and other counties is too large, and it should be distributed in a unified manner. Tian found out that this was true and has made two suggestions to the Shaanxi Provincial Government: (1) Collect the arrears of food after the wheat is ripe this year.

<h3>Admiral Fraser's Misunderstanding: Called Us Barbarians in Tokyo and Said Hong Kong is British Territory</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent in Tokyo, 11th] Admiral Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, held a press conference here today, attended by many reporters from allied countries and Japan. He said, "I have just arrived here from China, met with General MacArthur, and inspected the British troops in Kure. I admire General MacArthur very much. General MacArthur has achieved great success in Japan. The United Kingdom and the United States have been cooperating for four years, and we are willing to continue this friendship in the Pacific."</p>
<p>Speaking of China, Fraser said, "The situation in China is extremely chaotic. In any case, they are still barbarians."</p>
<p>Our reporter immediately stood up and questioned, "China has lost two million people in this war. Can the British still mention this matter? The British army was stationed in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places, and they were lost after only a few weeks. Have the British also forgotten this?" Hearing this, Fraser smiled bitterly and said, "In any case, China is a very suitable country for recuperation, especially Peiping." Fraser's answer was irrelevant and incoherent. After hearing this, all the reporters laughed.</p>
<p>Hoppert, a reporter from the Associated Press, asked whether the British army was still occupying Hong Kong. Fraser replied, "Hong Kong is British territory." Our reporter immediately asked, "Do you know that 99% of Hong Kong's population are Chinese?" Fraser replied, "Indeed, after negotiations with the Chinese authorities, it should be returned to China."</p>

<h3>Amnesty Case Decided to be Postponed; Expected to Pass After Recovery is Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 11th, the draft amnesty decree submitted by the Minister Chen Cheng in response to the letter from the secretary of the Supreme National Defense Council and the draft law on the remission of sentences for criminals proposed by the member Ju Zheng were discussed together. Because this matter is of great importance, all the attending members concentrated and carefully studied it, and the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. After the case was reported by Liu Kejie of the Criminal Law Committee, members Sun Jiulu, Liu Keshu, Luo Ding, and Liu Guanxun successively stood up to speak, roughly stating: The victory of the War of Resistance has been eight months, and the country has not yet stabilized. It is not yet time to promulgate an amnesty decree, advocating postponement. Member Liu Tong then advocated passing it, and listed the following three reasons: (1) Section 44 of the Provisional Constitution and the May 5th Constitution both have provisions for amnesty. (2) After the victory of the War of Resistance, the nation has been resurrected, and the country has turned from weak to strong. The whole country celebrates, do not forget to show mercy. (3) Many criminals in prison have committed crimes due to circumstances and should be forgiven. Member Lou Tongsun believes that amnesty has feudal overtones, although it is reprehensible, it also has advantages. He hopes that it will be postponed and suggests two points: (1) The articles of the amnesty draft should be listed; (2) The date of promulgation of the amnesty should be after the constitution is passed. The case was then decided to be postponed. According to our reporter's investigation, once the recovery is completed, the country is stable, and the constitution is promulgated, the amnesty case is expected to pass.</p>

<h3>The Provisional Suspension of Food Tax Collection in Tongyao and Other Counties in Shaanxi Province: Tian Jiongjin Suggests to Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 11th] Tian Jiongjin, the supervisor of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, inspected Tong, Yao, Ning, Jing, Yuan, and Xian Counties a month ago. According to local gentry and people, the counties are urging the collection of last year's arrears of food, and the people are unable to pay. In addition, the price difference of Zhuanqian in Tong, Yao, and other counties is too large, and it should be distributed in a unified manner. Tian found out that this was true and has made two suggestions to the Shaanxi Provincial Government: (1) Collect the arrears of food after the wheat is ripe this year. (2) The price difference between Maqian is paid by the province in a unified manner, and the issue price is increased within the possible range.</p>

<h3>Admiral Fraser's Misunderstanding: Called Us Barbarians in Tokyo and Said Hong Kong is British Territory</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent in Tokyo, 11th] Admiral Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, held a press conference here today, attended by many reporters from allied countries and Japan. He said, "I have just arrived here from China, met with General MacArthur, and inspected the British troops in Kure. I admire General MacArthur very much. General MacArthur has achieved great success in Japan. The United Kingdom and the United States have been cooperating for four years, and we are willing to continue this friendship in the Pacific."</p>
<p>Speaking of China, Fraser said, "The situation in China is extremely chaotic. In any case, they are still barbarians."</p>
<p>Our reporter immediately stood up and questioned, "China has lost two million people in this war. Can the British still mention this matter? The British army was stationed in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places, and they were lost after only a few weeks. Have the British also forgotten this?" Hearing this, Fraser smiled bitterly and said, "In any case, China is a very suitable country for recuperation, especially Peiping." Fraser's answer was irrelevant and incoherent. After hearing this, all the reporters laughed.</p>
<p>Hoppert, a reporter from the Associated Press, asked whether the British army was still occupying Hong Kong. Fraser replied, "Hong Kong is British territory." Our reporter immediately asked, "Do you know that 99% of Hong Kong's population are Chinese?" Fraser replied, "Indeed, after negotiations with the Chinese authorities, it should be returned to China."</p>

After the case was reported by Liu Kejie of the Criminal Law Committee, members Sun Jiulu, Liu Keshu, Luo Ding, and Liu Guanxun successively stood up to speak, roughly stating: The victory of the War of Resistance has been eight months, and the country has not yet stabilized. It is not yet time to promulgate an amnesty decree, advocating postponement. Member Liu Tong then advocated passing it, and listed the following three reasons: (1) Section 44 of the Provisional Constitution and the May 5th Constitution both have provisions for amnesty. (2) After the victory of the War of Resistance, the nation has been resurrected, and the country has turned from weak to strong. The whole country celebrates, do not forget to show mercy.

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan held its first meeting after the return to the capital at the Municipal Government Auditorium on Zhongshan North Road at 9:00 AM on the 11th (the 299th meeting of the 4th session). The following members were present: Sun Jiulu, Wei Tingsheng, Chen Zifeng, Mei Shouchun, Chen Haicheng, Wang Quansheng, Liu Butong, Lou Tongsun, Situ De, Ling Yue, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Deng Hongpu, Luo Ding, Liu Tong, Chen Yang, Hong Ruizhao, Bao Zijin, Guan San, Ma Xiaojing, Zuo [name missing], Peng [name missing] Shi, Chen Changheng, [name missing] Xiaocen, Di Ying, Cheng Yuanzhen, Hou Kejing, Zhao [name missing] Chuan, [names missing], Wu Yunpeng, Qi Zhihou, Li [name missing] Gong, He Sui, Liu Keshushu, Zeng Yan, Zhao [name missing] Hua, Tan Tiwu, Hu Xuanming, Zhong Tianxin, Wang Bing [name missing], Zhang Ximan, [name missing] Yunyan, Huang Youchang, [name missing] Yingqian, [name missing] Xiu [name missing], Xu Bao [name missing], Liu [name missing] Xun, Guo Gongxuan, Wu Jing [name missing], Zhang Fengjiu, Wang Kunshan, Yu Zhen [name missing], [name missing] Yunsu, Wu Xueyi, [name missing] Xia [name missing], [name missing] Zhenwei, Li Jinfang, Liu Kejun, Li Qing [name missing], Lu Zhonglin, Chen Xun [name missing], Zou Jinqun, Cao Jin Yuan, Yang Jiong, Wen Yuanlu, Wang Yuxiang, Huang Jin [name missing], Chen Xianyuan, Ye Qiuyuan, Wang Yihan, Liu Shiping, and Mei Shuzeng, totaling seventy-four members.

Subsequently, the amendment to the Examination and Selection Regulations for Public Servants, specifically Article 64 of the third iteration, Article 24 of the Public Treasury Law, and the organizational regulations for the National Beiping Library and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were passed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] A temporary motion was proposed by Legislative Yuan member Jian Guansan and thirty-two others, calling for a thorough improvement in the treatment of public and private school staff. They argued that with the soaring prices in various regions, the livelihoods of public and private school staff could not be maintained, which was already affecting administrative efficiency. They stated that simply issuing goods in kind as a relief measure was insufficient and would only lead to corruption. They proposed: (1) calculating the basic salaries of public and private school staff at 600 times the pre-war level, (2) providing a minimum of 150,000 yuan per person per month for living subsidies, (3) converting goods in kind to cash at market prices, and (4) implementing these measures from March of this year. The motion was principally passed, and Jian Guansan, Li Qinglin, and [name missing] Xiaocen were tasked with revising the wording before submitting it to the National Defense Supreme Economic Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislative Yuan member Sun Jiulu proposed inviting President Song to the Legislative Yuan to explain the current economic policies of our country. The motion was passed, and President Song was requested to attend the next general meeting to report. It is noted that the Legislative Yuan currently holds meetings every half month, and the next general meeting (the 300th meeting) is expected to be held around the 25th of this month.</p>

<h3>Eisenhower Discusses Far East Mission in Japan: Studying Various Issues of the U.S. Military; Establishing Bases is to Guarantee World Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 11th Dispatch] General Dwight D. Eisenhower hosted foreign and Japanese reporters here today. Reportedly, the purpose of his visit to the Pacific is to study various issues of the U.S. military in the region. The United States plans to re-educate soldiers to become champions of democracy. Eisenhower also stated that, from a strategic point of view, the U.S. Army and Navy should be merged. When asked about the duration of the U.S. military's planned stay in Japan, Eisenhower replied that he had discussed this matter with MacArthur, who believed that the occupation would not end until the Japanese had a more valuable democratic mindset. Regarding Germany, Eisenhower believed that the most difficult aspect was political ideology. Germany had been destroyed, and reconstruction must start from the very bottom. In response to a question from our reporter, Eisenhower stated, "I hope that China can become a completely free country so that it can jointly establish world peace with its allies." Eisenhower stated that Chinese and Soviet troops would both participate in the occupation of Japan, and that the United States had no special forces in the Philippines other than those with temporary missions, as the Philippines had become an independent country. Eisenhower invited our reporter to accompany the U.S. [air force] to inspect U.S. troops stationed in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower told reporters here today that the entire key to the issue of U.S. bases in the Pacific depends on whether the United Nations organization can become a force that guarantees world peace. Eisenhower also reiterated his repeatedly expressed belief, stating, "The world cannot withstand another war. We all understand this." He also said that the major problem at present is to make the world understand that the various problems that caused wars in the past must be resolved through the United Nations organization. The issue of U.S. bases in the Philippines must also be considered in light of the future of the United Nations organization. At present, an agreement must be established with the Philippines to determine this. U.S. troops in China, having assisted in restoring post-war order as Allied troops, will soon withdraw. Regarding the participation of Soviet troops in the occupation of Japan, Eisenhower said that he had not heard of any recent negotiations, but China would soon send troops, and the Philippines could also dispatch a division, while British troops had already arrived. Earlier, Eisenhower explained his motives for touring the Pacific, saying that he intended to study military lessons related to the war in Europe for reference in long-term planning. This kind of knowledge can be obtained through meetings with MacArthur and other generals. The island-hopping tactics used by the generals here are completely different from the large-scale landing warfare in the European theater, which constantly attacked the main force of the enemy. In addition, there are the issues of occupation and the re-education of the Japanese towards democracy, the most important of which is the continued stationing of sufficient troops to complete this mission, using methods that are fair to all parties. Morale in the Pacific is very good, and the U.S. soldiers seen are all happy to fulfill their duties, but this does not mean that soldiers on isolated islands do not miss home. The occupation of Germany is also completely different, and the U.S. troops there have achieved excellent results in recent months.</p>
<h3>Pauley Discusses Japan's Reparations Plan: Surplus Military Factories to be Distributed Among the Allies; Claims He Will Go to Nanjing to Discuss Details with General Marshall</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 11th Dispatch] President Truman's representative, Edwin W. Pauley, Commissioner of the German and Japanese Reparations Commission, stated today while hosting Allied and Japanese reporters: the reparations plan proposes distributing Japan's surplus factories and industries, which are exclusively for Japan's war machine and are not needed in the domestic economy, to countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression and war, such as Korea, the Philippines, and other countries, to assist in food production. Pauley then replied to a reporter from the Chicago Sun that he had not heard of China dismantling Japanese factories in Taiwan, but that he would still go to Taiwan to investigate. He then replied to a reporter from NBC that all machinery and equipment taken by the Soviet Union in the Northeast and North Korea should be regarded as reparations for the Allied nations. A reporter from the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin asked, "Has your Excellency obtained Soviet permission to enter the Northeast and Korea?" Pauley replied that he had not, but was currently in the process of requesting it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] U.S. Reparations Commissioner Edwin W. Pauley declared here today that Japan's reparations plan would not reduce Japan's production capacity to below that of 1933. Japan will still maintain sufficient productive capacity to manufacture goods needed by the public. After 1933, Japan's production volume increased rapidly, and most of it was for wartime supplies. The reparations plan is to eliminate this wartime productive capacity. I plan to inspect northern Korea and the nine northeastern provinces of China after obtaining Soviet permission. If industrial equipment has indeed been removed as usual, I will provide opinions based on the U.S. position. The United States emphasizes the economic problems of China, northern Korea, and the nine northeastern provinces, and not the value of this equipment. Japan's assets in various countries in the Far East will also be included when distributing reparations. Countries with Japanese assets have already been asked to register them, and other relevant countries are discussing the issue of reparations. I have suggested organizing a special committee to handle this matter, but have not received a reply.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] Edwin W. Pauley, the U.S. representative to the Allied Reparations Committee, is currently planning to go to northeastern China and northern Korea. Pauley, a semi-official private envoy of President Truman, arrived in Tokyo last night. This afternoon, he dined with MacArthur and discussed matters with Willoughby, the head of the Intelligence Group at MacArthur's headquarters. Pauley said that he hoped to stay in Tokyo for a few days, then fly to Nanjing to discuss the establishment of a headquarters in the Northeast with Marshall. It is said that most of the Northeast is under Chinese control, so it is expected that his visit to various parts of the Northeast will not be difficult. The reparations commissioner also said that he has not yet contacted the Soviet Union regarding going to the Soviet-held territory of Korea, but has begun preliminary preparations, but he vaguely stated that he [would] first go to Korea.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou Strictly Bans Drugs:</h3>

<h3>Shen Honglie Discusses Water Conservancy and Transportation: Will Go to Eastern Zhejiang Tomorrow for Inspection; The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway Can Be Repaired by the End of June</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 11th Dispatch] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie hosted reporters in Hangzhou on the 11th. According to him, the central authorities in charge attach great importance to the seawall. The remaining 1 billion yuan of construction funds will be issued within days. The water conservancy budget is 1.6 billion yuan, and it has been agreed to issue 1 billion yuan first. The urgent and important projects in the Qu County, Linhai, and Tongzhu areas will be carried out first. The original 280 million yuan in highway repair funds can be received as is, and an additional 150 million yuan will be allocated for the Lanxi, Shouchang, and Baisha line projects. Once this road is repaired, transportation between Zhejiang and Jiangxi will be connected. It has also been agreed that the central government will be responsible for repairing the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the Qiantang River Bridge. It is estimated that the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway can be completed by the end of June. Construction on the Qiantang River Bridge can also begin as soon as engineers come to Hangzhou to survey the site. After the special county donations are all stopped, it will be even more difficult to balance local financial revenues and expenditures. The central government has agreed to have the Four Banks Joint Treasury borrow and allocate 1.2 billion yuan to this province first to provide a transition. In addition, the food and salaries of the security forces have been agreed to be increased as stipulated, and the food expenses of public-funded students in provincial schools have also been clearly stated to the authorities in charge in order to improve them. Also, it is reported that the newly appointed Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, Luo Fulun, came to Hangzhou on the 12th, and Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Finance Department, will also come to Zhejiang from Chongqing within days to take office. Chairman Shen is scheduled to go to various counties in eastern Zhejiang on the 13th to inspect and preside over administrative meetings in the 4th, 5th, and 11th districts, and to consult with Pacification Director Yu Hanmou on the issue of public security in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 11th Dispatch] There are currently 20,000 dan of rice in Hangzhou. Another 20,000 dan have recently been transported from Fujian and Anhui, so there will be no problem with food for the people. Rice prices are gradually stabilizing and tending to fall.</p>
<h3>Soybeans are Worth Hundreds of Millions: Why Does China Neglect Them? ArnoLte's Report</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 10th] In a report submitted to the China Research Institute, ArnoLte, the former U.S. Commercial Counselor in China, said that if cultivated carefully, China could turn its "neglected" soybeans into a huge industry worth hundreds of millions. The report has now been published in the China Research Institute's quarterly. ArnoLte described the origin and history of soybeans in detail and pointed out their commercial and nutritional value. He said, "There is one thing I sincerely cannot understand, why do the Chinese people neglect soybeans, and are they not aware of its importance to this extent?" ArnoLte pointed out that soybeans are highly valued in the United States. In 1907, only 50,000 mu of land were planted, but by 1943, it had expanded to 16 million mu. In 1925, the United States produced 5 million U.S. bushels of soybeans, which increased to 193 million U.S. bushels in 1944. "This is almost equal to the entire output of China (including the Northeast)." At this time of famine in the Far East, China can use soybean milk to replace cow's milk. Soybeans can be planted everywhere in China. "The Chinese government should do its best to encourage private enterprises to establish soybean industries, especially those engaged in the production, trade, and other soybean food products of soybean milk. This move can help rebuild China's post-war economy," he said.</p>
<h3>Communist Gao You County Magistrate: Secretly Comes to Zhenjiang to Surrender</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th Dispatch] Yang Tianhua, the Communist magistrate of Gao You County, and Zheng Ping, the secretary of the Eastern Rugao County Party Committee, secretly came to Zhenjiang yesterday to surrender to the authorities and issued a declaration, vowing to fight to the death against the Communist Party, which betrayed the nation, under the leadership of the Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Xu Zhen Discusses Impressions of the Inspection Tour: Most of the Farmland in Western Liaoning Has Been Sown; Communist Army's Destruction of Railways Affects People's Livelihoods</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 11th Dispatch] Xu Zhen, Chairman of Liaoning Province, returned from an inspection tour of western Liaoning. According to him, recently, the Communist army often destroyed bridges and tracks along the Suizhong area of the Beining Railway, which has a serious impact on the national livelihood. On the evening of the 6th, he led several staff members from Shenyang west. In four nights and three days, he personally visited Xinmin, Dahu Mountain, Goubangzi, Jinzhou, Jinxi, Suizhong, Huludao, Shanhaiguan and other places. The people who have returned to the embrace of the motherland, their patriotic feelings, and boiling blood are inspiring. In order to inspect the bridges, bunkers, the deployment of the garrison, and the deployment of railway laborers along the way, I stopped the car at each bridge late at night to check them one by one and give instructions. The military and civilians in various places were extremely excited. In addition, the damage suffered in western Liaoning is very slight because the national army took over earlier. Most of the farmland has been sown. Although there is a shortage of manpower, draft animals, and agricultural implements, it is not a major problem. As for the police brigades, volunteer police teams, and militia joint defense teams responsible for local public security, and the actual situation of education, people have been sent to various places at all levels to conduct thorough investigations.</p>

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>#### Wujin Villagers Destroy Courthouse</p>
<p>In the case of the sudden death of Xu Chu Fengdi, a woman from Tongzhuang Township, Wujin Seventh District, it was determined by the County Procuratorate in February that she died of acute dysentery. Her father, Chu Fanglin, was not convinced and appealed to the Suzhou High Court, which approved sending staff from the Wuxi County Procuratorate to Changzhou to exhume the body for a second autopsy. However, Liu Enci, the procurator who came to examine the body, did not perform the exhumation procedure and also ruled that she died of acute dysentery. This aroused public outrage among dozens of people, who went to the Wujin County Court to destroy furniture, tear up documents, and remove the plaque that was hung in the courtroom, "The Nation is Governed by Law," and changed it to "The Nation is Governed by Money," and paraded it around. The situation is likely to escalate. The County Court President Sun Jing and Chief Prosecutor Wang Yuxiu came to Suzhou to ask for instructions. The High Court sent Prosecutor Shen Bingrong and Clerk Wang Rong and a court policeman to Changzhou on the 10th to investigate the truth. Sun and Wang went to the Ministry of Justice in Nanjing to report.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>#### The County Government Expands and Merges Township Areas</p>
<p>In order to expand the area of townships and improve township organizations, the county government decided to reduce the original 260 townships in the county to 82 townships. In addition to sending it to the County Temporary Council for review and submitting it to the province for approval, it ordered that it be implemented in all districts from June 1st. The selection of township chiefs is currently being carried out carefully.</p>
<p>#### Farmers Dig Dyke to Obstruct Irrigation</p>
<p>Chuan Port, which is located at the junction of the Seventh District of this county and Cheng County, has always been the exit of the mountain pass in the Cheng territory. The water flow of Chuan Port is necessary for the irrigation of farmland in the Chang territory. This spring, Cheng County built a sand field and built a dyke at the Duan Mountain pass to cut off the flow, causing the Chuan Port to dry up and unable to irrigate, arousing the anger of the farmers in the Chang territory. On the 8th, more than 5,000 farmers dug up the dyke to open the water flow and presented a petition to the county, which was forwarded to the province, to stop the construction of the dyke.</p>

<p>#### A Large Number of Smokers Forcibly Rehabilitated</p>
<p>The city defense headquarters of this county is determined to eradicate drugs. It has designated Dushan Temple in Taihu Lake as a drug rehabilitation center. Starting at 12:00 AM on the 9th, it ordered the mobilization of military police, together with township and baojia chiefs, to implement the search and arrest of smokers. As a result, two or three hundred people were arrested on the spot and temporarily detained in the township offices. On the morning of the 10th, they were all escorted to Dushan for group rehabilitation.</p>

<p>#### The Provincial Government Issues an Order to Abolish Special Product Donations</p>
<p>Due to financial difficulties in this year's budget, Zhejiang province's county governments have opened up and collected special product donations to offset their financial balance. These levies included over a dozen goods produced in eastern Zhejiang such as, bamboo, wood, paper, oil, silk, tea, ham, cotton cloth, and mushrooms. These special donations have become a variable corvée tax which has disturbed the area and caused the people to be annoyed. The provincial government received reports from all sides and for the reason that the special product donation was only to offset the financial inadequacies of the various counties and the actual amount collected has been meager, and the people have been greatly harmed, an order was sent to the counties to all cancel their product collections and that there be no further collection. In addition, the Sixth District Commissioner's Office of Zhejiang Province, fearing that the counties under its jurisdiction would privately collect illegal donations and taxes, issued an order to all counties under its jurisdiction the day before yesterday to strictly prohibit the unauthorized collection of donations and taxes.</p>
<p>#### Suspect Arrested Refuses Bail</p>
<p>Xiao Jugen, who once served as the district chief of Hang County, did not change his style of acting tyrannically in the countryside during the guerrilla period after the victory. The Hang County government had requested the higher authorities to issue an arrest warrant, but he had not been arrested. Recently, Xiao was hiding at No. 1 Jiaoren Lane, Jiaoren Street, Hangzhou, and was discovered by Shen Jie, the township chief of Xian Shi Township, who was ordered to conduct a secret investigation. He consulted with Lu Shushi, the executive committee member of the county party headquarters, and Li Caizhang, the county senator, and reported to the Second Branch of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau. On the morning of the 2nd at 11:00 AM, they went to Jiaoren Lane to arrest Xiao and transferred him to the county government for prosecution. It is reported that Zheng from the county party headquarters intended to bail him out because he had previously worked for Xiao in underground work. The county government believed that there was no definite evidence for the so-called underground work because Xiao was suspected of being a traitor and had refused the bail.</p>

<h3>Current Problems in Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>— Yu Zengkang</p>
<p>Since the victory, maritime transport has been open for almost half a year, but the progress of international trade has consistently been in a pessimistic atmosphere. China's foreign trade was originally not very reasonable, and now it has added many difficulties, making it even more difficult for trade trends to return to normal. Whether or not foreign trade is reasonable is related to the development of the entire economy, so current trade problems urgently need to be adjusted and reasonably resolved. The author would like to express his humble opinions on what he has observed, and hopes for correction from experts.</p>
<p>After the opening of the foreign exchange market on February 4th, the current exchange rate, in terms of purchasing power parity, shows that the national currency is too high. This makes imports easy and exports unfavorable, and even industries and agriculture are feeling severely threatened, gradually becoming panic-stricken. As a result, at the beginning of this month, many rumors about foreign exchange policy arose, and the price of US dollars fluctuated sharply. The instability of the US dollar makes it difficult to stabilize foreign exchange, which shows that there are some problems with the exchange rate. At the same time, arguments have also arisen to devalue the currency and raise the exchange rate. If China wants to enhance its productivity and improve its economic status in the future, it must seek to expand trade. But to expand trade, it is necessary to revitalize exports first. More exports can then be exchanged for more imports to facilitate the advancement of economic construction. In order to promote exports, there must be a favorable exchange rate to encourage them, so countries all use currency devaluation as the only means to compete in the international market. Moreover, unreasonable imports must be stopped quickly. Although the reasoning is like this, we dare not agree with letting the exchange rate float freely in the current transition period when the domestic economy has not yet stabilized. This is because: first, although the current exchange rate is not fixed, any change will shake the people's confidence in legal tender, and speculation in US dollars and gold will further trigger financial chaos. Second, current prices are still in a state of unabated inflation, and if the exchange rate changes, prices will definitely not stop there just because their ratio is already higher than the ratio of the exchange rate. They will inevitably rise with the increase in the exchange rate, and it will be difficult to adjust the exchange rate and prices in the short term, so the hopes of exporters will still be difficult to realize. Moreover, the re-stirring of prices is not in the interest of industry and commerce. Third, the current domestic production situation is extremely bad, and the amount available for export is very small, so the effect of promoting exports that can be obtained from raising the exchange rate is probably very limited. Therefore, changes to the exchange rate should be carefully considered at this time.</p>
<p>Secondly, we currently do not want to further stimulate price fluctuations by raising the exchange rate, nor do we want to waste limited foreign exchange funds on unnecessary things and repeat the mistakes of the gold policy. Therefore, we hope that on the one hand, we must start with rectifying finances and tightening currency to fundamentally solve the price problem, thereby reducing the threat to the exchange rate. At the same time, on the foreign exchange itself, rather than changing the exchange rate, it is better to first make changes to the technology of foreign exchange settlement and trade management to adjust the current trade situation, and also improve the unreasonable state of the current exchange rate. In this way, currency confidence will not be shaken, and even more benefits can be gained than changing the exchange rate.</p>
<p>For the sake of current reconstruction and future construction, a large amount of imports are required so that industries can be developed and the country can enter a modern state. But to complete the mission of national construction, imports must be reasonable. Unfortunately, current imports have not been in line with the policy of national construction: first, most of the imported goods are not production equipment needed for construction, but only consumer goods; second, importers often do not consider the domestic supply and demand situation, but only consider the amount of price difference between domestic and foreign countries, blindly proceeding, resulting in the disadvantage of excess imports, of which caustic soda can be used as proof; third, the goods ordered by importers do not always consider whether they are needed domestically, resulting in a large amount of imported American cotton having very limited sales in the country. Such imports are chaotic and without planning. They cannot improve the domestic production situation, relieve the shortage of materials, but only waste limited foreign exchange funds. It is very regrettable that they are uneconomical! Moreover, the large-scale import of foreign consumer goods only increases the threat to industry and hinders the advancement of industrial recovery; while blind imports are difficult to guarantee even from the perspective of merchants' profits. This trend is not beneficial to the country or merchants, and the government must not allow it to drag on any longer. It must quickly seek improvement. As for raising the exchange rate, although it can have some improvement on this unreasonable situation, it cannot completely correct it, and it is also inconvenient to change it at present. Therefore, in order to make imports develop reasonably to meet economic needs, there is only one way to change the technology of foreign exchange settlement and trade management to strengthen control. The author believes that the authorities must conduct a detailed investigation and make overall plans on the current domestic supply and demand situation and the types of goods needed, and give importers active guidance so that imports can be rationalized and planned. The above-mentioned disadvantages of excess imports and unmet needs can be eliminated. At the same time, improvements must be made to foreign exchange settlement. Various conveniences must be given for production equipment and essential materials; if only consumer goods are involved, strict review must be carried out. Imports should be curbed or reduced except for those that cannot be produced domestically or are not produced enough, so that the types of imported goods can be changed from consumer to productive. In this way, the panic of industry can be relieved, our productivity can be enhanced, and the solution to the current price problem will be greatly helpful.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the increase in imports in the future will be very considerable, especially for productive materials, which is the inevitable result of promoting industrialization. In order to cope with this huge amount of imports, although we can rely on foreign capital, we must still strive to export to enhance our foreign purchasing power and seek the development of national capital. The importance of export trade in economic construction in the future can be known. The revitalization of exports is inevitable. Although the current export trade is very pessimistic, we must find ways to remedy it and strive to improve it in preparation for large-scale expansion in the future. The unfavorable exchange rate for exports is a temporary phenomenon, and it will inevitably be adjusted in the future. However, future exports cannot only rely on raising the exchange rate, because too high an exchange rate is not what is needed for post-war economic construction. Moreover, the reason why exports have been sluggish in the past also has its fundamental reasons. If these key problems are not resolved, even if a favorable exchange rate is set, its development will be limited and it will still not be able to meet the needs of economic construction. Therefore, for the revitalization of exports at present, instead of arguing about changes in the exchange rate, it is better to make fundamental reforms as soon as possible to enhance export capacity. According to the development of exports, sufficient productivity and strong sales force are necessary conditions. China's export goods are far from these conditions. If they are not improved, how can they compete in the international market to gain an advantage? Regarding this point, according to my humble opinion, attention should be paid to the following: First, China's main export products, silk and tea, have suffered serious damage during the war. Not only has the production quantity been greatly reduced, but the quality has also been lowered. Naturally, they urgently need to be restored so that exports can be revived, but this cannot be achieved in the short term, and requires the active assistance of the state. Second, China's exports are still limited to agricultural products and raw materials. The narrow range of export goods severely restricts trade development. Therefore, the types of export goods must be actively expanded in the future to enhance export capacity. And it must also be extended to manufactured goods to improve exchange conditions and adjust trade trends, which is necessary to improve economic status. This point is of great importance and must be closely monitored and actively improved. Third, the quality must be improved and standardized to consolidate and expand the market and occupy an advantageous position. Fourth, protect the interests of producers so that they can increase production and reduce export costs to enhance external competitiveness. Both of these measures lie in the reduction of the middle exploitation layer. Fifth, strengthen trade organizations, and the government must implement incentive policies so that the sales force of export goods can be enhanced. The above five points are basic issues in promoting exports that urgently need to be resolved and cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>The market issue is also an important issue in developing export trade. In order to seek a large-scale expansion of exports, it must be diversified. It is wrong to only focus on the United States now. We must work hard to find markets all over the world, and we must suit the market and seize it. Originally, Nanyang, the main market for China's exports, after Japan's fall, China must quickly rise to replace it and be in a leading position, because Nanyang can be a very promising market for the development of China's industrial products in the future, and help our industrialization construction. In the future, exports to the United States will be mainly special raw materials, supplemented by exquisite handicraft products; exports to Nanyang will be cheap industrial products. These exports are all suitable for China's production capacity. In the post-war era, since there is such a broad market, exporters and industrialists should have a long-term vision and move forward as soon as possible to face future expansion, and must not abandon themselves because of the current weakness and unfavorable exchange rates. Especially in the Nanyang market, if China delays any longer, Japan is likely to quickly resume exports, and the Indian textile industry already has surplus capacity to supply. If we miss the opportunity, it will be by no means easy to compete for the market in the future, and it will have a serious adverse impact on my country's industrial development.</p>
<p>In short, future foreign trade must be in line with the country's economic construction policies, so the current unreasonable state should be improved as soon as possible. As for exports, efforts should first be made to remove the original obstacles, increase production, and improve operations at the same time to strive for the market. These are all prerequisites, and changing the exchange rate is not yet the time at present.</p>

<h3>Stalemate on the Italian Issue among the Four Powers has been Partially Broken; Soviets Agree to UN Trusteeship of Tripoli; Informal Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 11th: The Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was on the verge of collapse, has now been revived. Yesterday, the Soviet, British, and French Foreign Ministers earnestly put forward new proposals as follows: (1) The Soviet Union agrees to give up its request for trusteeship of Tripoli, and Italy will manage it independently under the supervision of the United Nations. (2) The British side agrees to give up the Libyan independence plan, and Italy will implement the trusteeship system in Tripoli, but the British side must obtain trusteeship over Cyrenaica. (3) The French Foreign Minister suggested that the Soviet Union should obtain £25 million in compensation from Italy, and other compensation can be replaced by ceding territory. Molotov said he did not object, but Byrnes argued that £2.5 million should be taken from Italy's industrial assets abroad.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 11th: The Italian compensation and colonial issues were still the subject of discussion at the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference today, with mixed results. Yesterday, Molotov and Bevin suddenly worked hard to find a compromise on the Italian colonial issue. At the same time, during today's informal talks, the Foreign Ministers also made a final effort on the Soviet demand for Italian compensation, trying to find a compromise. It has been found that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has undergone great changes this week. Negotiations had previously reached a stalemate, but now, due to the final struggle of the Foreign Ministers, a ray of hope has appeared.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 10th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference seemed to improve today. Regarding the handling of Italian territories, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes agreed with the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's motion, but attached the condition that Libya and Eritrea should be allowed to become independent after ten years. However, according to British sources, British Foreign Secretary Bevin insisted that Libya and Eritrea should be granted independence immediately, and requested that Cyrenaica in Libya be placed under British trusteeship. Some observers believe that Molotov's actions are sufficient to imply that the Soviet Union almost wants to avoid any responsibility for undermining future peace conferences.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers, in order to break the stalemate on the issue of peace in Europe, announced today that they had drafted three preliminary agreements: (1) to place Italy's South African colonies under the trusteeship of the United Nations; (2) to give the Soviet Union compensation of 100 million yuan from Italy; (3) to appoint an Allied committee to supervise the trial of war criminals.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] The stalemate on the Italian issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference seems to have been partially broken. Molotov has agreed to abandon the Soviet Union's individual trusteeship demand for Tripoli, and supports France's proposal to place the area under UN trusteeship and allow Italy to participate. Byrnes further suggested that a condition should be attached, stipulating that Libya and Eritrea may be made independent within ten years, before the French proposal can be approved. Although no agreement has been reached at that time, the possibility seems to be not small. British representative Bevin advocated that the United Kingdom should be entrusted with the custody of Cyrenaica and Senussia. Regarding the compensation issue, France also proposed a compromise. The Soviet Union originally demanded that Italy pay 300 million yuan in compensation, of which 100 million yuan was to be paid to Greece and Yugoslavia. Bidault believed that Yugoslavia may be able to obtain some territorial concessions, and the Soviet Union is the only country among the Allies that has not controlled Italian foreign funds, so its request should not be considered excessive. Byrnes agreed to consider this suggestion and said that he may approve it.</p>
<h3>Churchill Explains to Reporters the Plan to Form a European Federation, Saying that it Can Start Locally and Gradually Expand; Expresses Concern about the Situation in Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Amsterdam, 11th] Churchill said in a speech to more than fifty Dutch journalists yesterday: If we cannot organize a federation that includes the entire Europe, we should first organize the part that can be organized, and then gradually expand it. Churchill expressed concern about the situation in Germany, and he hoped that the German people could become independent as soon as possible. When reporters asked whether Western Europe should wait for the Soviet Union's consent at the beginning of organizing the federation, Churchill replied: This is the question of how long we should wait, which is undecided. Churchill had lunch with Queen Wilhelmina in the palace yesterday and went to Leiden University in the afternoon to receive an honorary doctorate.</p>
<h3>This Kind of Churchill's Claim has Been Proposed More than Once</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 10th] Churchill's proposal to establish a European Federation including Eastern and Western Europe, this dramatic proposal, has re-promoted the idealism that has been studied for several generations. Churchill made this amazing plan at a time when relations between the Soviet Union and Western Allied countries were precarious. He had just expressed his loyal understanding to the Soviet Union two days ago, saying that this would avoid disaster. What is worth noting is that Churchill has advocated this kind of unity more than once. In 1940, when France appealed to Germany for peace in a tragic defeat, the government led by Churchill proposed to sign a sacred alliance agreement with France. This plan would allow Britain and France to declare a merger into a British-French Federation, no longer divided into two. It is hoped that Churchill will further analyze his current proposal, especially the phrase "including both Eastern and Western Europe." In practice, the Soviet Union has incorporated all of Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula into its sphere of influence, and has apparently established an Eastern Federation. Then, it is only necessary to create a Western Union to seek coordination between the two parts. The ideal of a European Federation has been discussed countless times in the 19th century. The United States of America has succeeded in maintaining the unity of the forty-eight states. The promoters of this plan are mostly encouraged by this. From a historical point of view, since the collapse of the Roman Empire, there have been Napoleon in the distant past and French Foreign Minister Briand after World War I who advocated the organization of a European Federation. According to Briand's plan, the European Federation has a total territory of 1.932 million miles and a population of 250 million. The world's people find it quite touching, while the opponents regard it as the pursuit of long-haired idealists.</p>

<h3>Stalin's "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)": Has a Close Impact on the Global Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 11th dispatch] Although few outside know about Stalin's book "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", it is the best-selling book in the country. Since the publication of the revised edition seven years ago, a total of 21 million copies have been sold, and it has been published in 60 different languages. Observers believe that the book has a close impact on the future global situation, and its importance is no less than the "Bible" and the "Quran". The book states: Since capitalism has entered socialism, making the working class free, one cannot use gradual reform, revolutionary methods must be employed. Therefore, to prevent policy errors, everyone should be a revolutionary and not a reformer. Capitalism and revolution are irreconcilable. There are irreconcilable elements within the capitalist system. Capitalism is the motive for aggression, so capitalist countries recognize war as a natural and legal action. The book recounts the scene of foreign capitalists uniting with the Tsar to oppress the working class, and the details of the civil war and intervention period are particularly detailed. The book ends with six conclusions: (1) A people's revolution cannot be successful without the revolutionary party of the proletariat; (2) the Bolshevik Party cannot succeed if it does not believe in Marxism-Leninism; (3) the elimination of splitters is one of the reasons for the success of the social revolution; (4) one should take an uncompromising attitude towards opportunists within the party; (5) one should encourage criticism and recognize one's own shortcomings; (6) One should maintain the closest contact with the people to become a truly people-centered regime.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Passes Loan to Britain: The House of Representatives is Scheduled to Begin Discussion This Week</h3>

Britain does not need to pay interest during this period. Interest at a rate of 2% per annum will be paid from 1951. In some cases, interest may be waived if British exports decline. In exchange, Britain agrees to lift wartime currency restrictions within a year. According to this restriction, the so-called Sterling Area can only purchase British goods and use them in Britain for the price of goods sold to Britain. Republican Senator Taft, an opponent of the bill, declared in the Senate that Britain needs 2.2 billion to meet its emergency financial needs, and 1.3 billion to transport British troops from all over the world back home, leaving very little for long-term financial assistance.</p>
<p>Bevin Expresses Gratification</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said this morning after learning that the U.S. loan to Britain had been passed by the U.S. Senate: "The news is gratifying. It shows that the two countries are moving in the same direction. The relationship will be more solid in the future and will help world peace."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th dispatch] Peiffer Whiteley, a cabinet member of the British Churchill Cabinet, spoke three minutes after the U.S. Senate approved the loan to Britain last night, saying, "We have sold the empire and got a small sum of money. The land we have sown will be reaped by the United States in the future."</p>
<p>[Further dispatch] Although the U.S. Senate has approved the loan agreement to Britain, it still has to go through the debate in the House of Representatives, so the British government does not want to publish a document immediately. However, according to an informal statement by a government official, they are deeply gratified by the Senate's move. According to Brewer, President of the National Association of Manufacturers, he personally is not very interested in the agreement, because it is closely related to the Bretton Woods Agreement and the removal of tariff barriers, but the loan can indeed help Britain through the most difficult period. According to general expectations, the British government originally intended to take some restrictive measures, especially restrictions on purchasing goods from the dollar area. Now that the U.S. Senate has passed it, these methods will not be implemented for a while.</p>

<h3>Premier Song Cares for People's Food: 2 Million Stones of Sichuan Rice: Urgently Transported to Shanghai; Transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Landing Craft; Food Administration Authorities Order Rice Merchants to Rush to Production Areas to Purchase</h3>
<p>According to Pang Songzhou, Vice Minister of the Food Ministry, who told reporters at his private residence last night, "Premier Song is extremely concerned about the food problem in this city. He has instructed the Food Ministry to purchase 2 million stones of rice in Sichuan Province and try to transport it urgently to the east, and has instructed the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send ships to load it. At the same time, it has rented 20 landing craft from the U.S. military to assist in transportation, which will be managed by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Each landing craft has a load capacity of about 250 to 350 tons. One of them has already set off on a trial voyage.</p>
<p>Also, the rising rice prices in recent days have caused anxiety among the general public. According to the investigation, the main reason is that the county governments in various rice-producing areas have taken measures such as banning grain exports to maintain local food supplies. Reporters went to various rice wharves in the city yesterday to conduct on-the-spot inspections. The quantity of rice arriving in recent days is indeed less than before, leading to soaring grain prices. The Food Administration Authorities are extremely concerned about this. Yesterday, they again summoned the Soy and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Brokerage Association to rush to print purchase certificates and distribute them to grain merchants to rush to various rice-producing areas to purchase rice with the certificates, in order to open up the rice source. According to the person in charge of the Soy and Rice Industry Association, the rice reserves in this city are extremely ample, and the private rice reserves alone amount to more than 700,000 to 800,000 stones.</p>

The meeting specially invited Director Xuan of the Police Bureau to come to the meeting to report. Deputy Director Yu Shuping of the Police Bureau came to the meeting to explain, saying that the police district system is stipulated by central laws and regulations, and this city is prepared to conduct a pilot run in the Changshu District first, and it is not immediately implemented universally. As for the rumored door-to-door visit, it is a misunderstanding and not a fact.</p>

<h3>British Tram Company Resumes Normal Operations; All Lines Running as Usual Yesterday; Labor and Management Awaiting Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau; Sick Leave and Retirement Issues Resolved</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] More than two hundred unemployed workers of the British Tram Company protested over the unresolved issue of reinstatement. In addition, over three thousand employed workers protested regarding the adjustment of base salaries and the management's refusal to implement the mediation record signed by both parties on January 30th. They staged a work slowdown the day before yesterday afternoon, with trams running but stopping ticket sales. After persuasion from Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers agreed to wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. Therefore, starting yesterday, all tram lines resumed normal operations and are running as usual. The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both labor and management for mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. Three representatives from management and eight representatives from labor, including six employed workers and two unemployed workers, attended. Director Zhao from the Labor Department, Section Chief Fan from the Mediation Section, and Consultant Wang from the bureau attended. The discussions were quite heated, lasting from 10 AM to 7:30 PM. During the meeting, Director Zhao reportedly left the meeting in anger over a certain issue. The Taishan Police Precinct dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to maintain order. As a result of the late hour and the exhaustion of all parties after a day of discussion, only the issues of sick leave and retirement were resolved. Other issues, such as the adjustment of base salaries and the reinstatement of unemployed workers, were postponed for further discussion at 9 AM on the 13th. After the meeting, labor representatives went to the Shanghai North District Investigation Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters at 147 Weihaiwei Road to discuss unresolved issues with Section Chief Ma to find a solution. The Tram Company's industrial union issued notices overnight, urging workers to work peacefully, maintain transportation, and wait for further mediation.</p>

<h3>Illiterate Puppet Commissioner Wang Yongkang is a Complete "Rogue"; Claims He Didn't Run a Gambling Den and Wasn't Chu Ni's Godson; High Court Held Preliminary Hearing on Five Traitor Cases Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, presided over by Judge Qiu Huaning, heard several cases of suspected traitors. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Qian Nengxia</p>
<p>Thirty-six years old, from Qingpu, residing at 146 Danfeng Bridge, Nanjing. Formerly a staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he joined a puppet organization and served as the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters. In September of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he was appointed as a Secretary with Simplified Appointment of the puppet Ministry of Transportation. In February of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was appointed as a Secretary with Simplified Appointment of the puppet Ministry of Social Welfare. In April of the same year, he was reassigned as the Director of the Occupational Affairs Department of the same ministry. In June, he was transferred to be the Director of the General Affairs Department. In January of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he was appointed as the Director of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Social Welfare Bureau. In April of the same year, he concurrently served as the Chairman of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Housing Mediation Committee. In July of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he was appointed as the Director of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Economic Bureau. He is suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. In court yesterday morning, Qian was wearing a black brocade gown and yellow leather shoes. His answers were like a speech, claiming he was an underground worker. Because he lost contact and was forced by circumstances, he took the last resort. Judge Qiu reprimanded him, asking why he betrayed his country and party since he was a member of the Kuomintang. Qian cleverly replied, "That's why I specialized in social welfare, serving the people."</p>
<p>Liu Weijun</p>
<p>Forty-four years old, from Changting, Fujian, residing at 100 Tianzhuang, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road. Graduated from the Economics Department of Tsinghua University in Peiping. Formerly a librarian at the Institute of Science of the Central Research Institute. In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), he was appointed as an Editor with Recommendation Appointment of the puppet Ministry of Finance. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he was promoted to be a member of the Tariff Commission of the puppet Ministry of Finance. In March of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), he was appointed as an Editor with Simplified Appointment of the Counselor's Office of the puppet Executive Yuan. In March of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he was appointed as a Secretary with Designation Appointment of the puppet Economic Committee. In February of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was promoted to be the Director of the General Affairs Department of the puppet Ministry of Construction. In October of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), he was reassigned as the Director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Industry. In May of the same year, he was also appointed as the Director of the Fisheries Administration Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Industry. After the victory, he was arrested by military authorities. He appeared in court yesterday morning wearing a blue robe, cloth shoes, and a shaved head. He is a fat man. According to his statement, his joining the puppet government was entirely due to the pressure of life. He married early, had too many children, and his wife was sick. When he had no other choice, he borrowed money from Chen Jintao and was appointed to a puppet position. He also defended himself against the indictment on three points: (1) His translation of the British economist Keynes' "The Economic Consequences of the Peace" was at the behest of Chen Lianjintao, intending to deal with Japan's economic invaders, contrary to the indictment's claim of "seeking economic cooperation between China and Japan." (2) His article "China's Export Tax" was to commend President Song of the Executive Yuan for the export tax policy implemented in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) and to criticize the poor modifications of the tariff implemented in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). (3) The plan to oppress fishermen and prevent maritime guerrillas was due to a letter from the Fisheries Association stating that more than twenty taxes were levied on fish transported from Taihu to Shanghai, requesting protection. Therefore, this plan was made, but it was never approved by superiors and was never carried out to the detriment of fishermen.</p>
<p>Wang Yongkang</p>
<p>Fifty-one years old, from Shanghai, residing at 1, Lane 855, Xiafei Road, a shareholder of the China Trade Bank, formerly a specialist of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and had opened the Yong'an Club gambling den. Wang is a burly man, wearing a dark green gown and black cloth shoes, and quite "roguish." According to his statement, he is illiterate and has little property. In March of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), through the introduction of Zhou Bangjun, he got to know Chu Minyi. To avoid the lack of freedom of movement during the blockade, Chu gave him the official position of specialist of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he never went to work. Judge Qiu asked him if he had拜褚民誼 as godfather, which he absolutely denied. As for the Yong'an gambling den, he said it was set up by Wang Aitang in August of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), with capital borrowed from him, but he did not declare the purpose in advance, so he demanded it back after half a year. Defense lawyer Huai Qun stood up and stated three points to the court: (1) The defendant surrendered himself, not arrested; (2) The defendant is illiterate and cannot actually be a puppet official. There are six or seven people with the same name as the defendant in Shanghai, fearing he has offended someone and been framed; (3) The gambling den was indeed not set up by the defendant, and the license can be checked. For the above three cases, the court ordered rescheduling for further hearing.</p>
<p>Then the court heard the cases of Zhu Ada and Cao Yaoting. Zhu was a rickshaw puller who translated for the enemy during the enemy occupation, taking advantage of his position to bully the people and commit many evils. He was arrested and punished after the victory. Witnesses Chen Shunzhi, Shen Jinsheng, Yang Maotou, Luo Yugen, Li Ziqi, Wang Qin'gen, Bao Rengui, and Xu Xinfu testified in court. In Cao Yaoting's case, since witnesses Wang Baoxun and Gao Yanmao had not arrived, after the presiding judge made a brief inquiry, both were ordered to be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Director Xuan Explains Establishment of "Police Management Zone" System; Preventing Bad Elements from Harming Society; Strengthening Police Efficiency to Ensure Public Security</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] To clarify the truth about the "Police Management Zone" system and avoid misunderstandings, Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, and Deputy Director Yu Shuping, invited reporters for a discussion at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 4 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Responsible for a Certain Area</p>
<p>Director Xuan explained that the "Police Management Zone" system is a very ordinary police system and not a special event. Its purpose is to strengthen police work, improve the system, and make each police officer responsible for a certain area so that the public has greater assurance of public security. Outsiders do not understand the truth and are uneasy, believing that the police will freely enter and exit citizens' homes. In fact, police officers will not arbitrarily disturb citizens unless there is a special reason for inquiry. Police officers can currently conduct household visits if necessary, and this does not need to start after the implementation of the Police Management Zone system. According to explicit provisions of national laws and regulations, the police can be responsible for a portion of judicial work and have the right to arrest certain criminals in order to "truly guarantee the freedom of the people." According to Article 39 of the Regular Police Service Rules promulgated by the Ministry of Interior on March 4, 1930: "Patrolling police officers should clearly investigate the winding roads, narrow streets, accurate number of households, citizens' occupations, and economic conditions in their area." Article 40 also states: "For (1) those undergoing imprisonment, (2) those declared probation, (3) those with bad behavior, (4) those who are suddenly rich or poor, whose income is insufficient, (5) those with frequent customers and personnel changes, and (6) those with household changes in hotels and factories, they should be inspected at any time to prevent bad elements from harming society." Therefore, those who are good citizens have no reason to oppose it.</p>
<p>The Rong Case is Complex</p>
<p>Director Xuan also said that the environment in Shanghai today is very different from that in 1936 or 1937. At that time, there was no war and the order was not disrupted. Currently, there are many unemployed people in society, and public security is difficult due to the pressure of high prices, which is expected. In this process of transition from chaos to stability, the strength of maintaining public security should be at least twice as high as before the war, but the actual number of police officers is only eight thousand, which is only one-third of the pre-war number. From the beginning of Shanghai's takeover to March, robbery cases dropped from more than 140 to more than 80, but in April they increased to more than 100. The main reason is that prices are soaring and people cannot maintain their livelihoods. The bureau has tried its best to solve the cases. As for the Rong Desheng case, the situation is complex and different from ordinary cases. It is not yet certain whether it can be solved or when it will be solved.</p>
<p>The current equipment of the "Police Management Zone" system trains 500 people per period, five periods per year, at the Police Bureau Training Center, one period every two months, plus one month of practice. In order to improve the quality, excellent young people are recruited and given the title of police officer, appointed from the 16th grade according to the lowest treatment of police officers. Their duties are divided into administrative and criminal, mainly investigating households, registering personnel changes, and guarding against bandits. The area under the jurisdiction of each police officer is proportional to the number of households and police officers in the area. The current treatment of police officers has been changed to a total of 52,000 yuan starting in April. In addition to some new recruits who were recruited through exams, the rest were trained by the former patrol房 and received the education of that time, that is, the responsible branch offices stipulated two hours of training every day. Therefore, it is hoped that people in society will not have prejudices and despise police officers.</p>
<p>Regulations for Performer Registration</p>
<p>Regarding the registration of performers, Director Xuan stated that in Article 16 of the Municipal Government's "Regulations for the Management of Entertainment Venues in Shanghai," the police bureau should investigate the status and accurate number of performers to ensure their rights are guaranteed. There are no less than 10,000 performers in the city, among whom there are many excellent talents, but also many with bad behavior. The police bureau has the right to crack down. Issuing performer permits is not much different from issuing permits to lawyers, doctors, or identity cards. If there are those who consider themselves excellent and want to change the registration method, they can ask the police bureau to transfer it to the municipal government.</p>
<p>Numbered seating in cinemas is also to maintain order in public places. A few cinemas do not accept it and rise up in opposition, but the reasons they give seem insufficient. If there are losses, the bureau has agreed to request the municipal government to allow an additional showing each day to compensate. In fact, after the order is improved, it can only increase income and there is no reason for losses. After Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, and others requested a postponement, it has been granted. The prohibition of smoking in the venues is also quite unreasonable for some people to oppose. Public places filled with smoke are harmful to public health. The bureau has successively received many requests from citizens to strictly prohibit smoking in the venues. The work of prohibiting smoking and drugs is as important as maintaining public security. The bureau has long stipulated measures. Those who do not comply will be handed over to the court for investigation and punishment. More than 300 people have been handed over in January. If people report it, it will be strictly investigated and handled.</p>
<h3>Chen Dailun Stole a Jeep; It Happened Once Before; The Deceased's Father Went to the Police Bureau Yesterday to Handle the Corpse Collection; Bao An Tuan Members Picked Up Kangfu and Sent Him to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Report] According to the Shanghai Vehicle Joint Inspection Office, Chen Dailun, the 16-year-old student who was shot and killed by police officers for stealing a jeep the day before yesterday, was found to have committed theft last Sunday after investigation. On that day, when the office sent personnel to patrol, they saw an ownerless jeep parked on Xin Zha Road. When they went to check it, just as they were about to drive it back to the office, Chen Dailun came out and argued, and showed the armband of the Bao An Tuan. Because Chen Dailun had no solid documents, the office impounded the car and did not take Chen to the bureau, only instructing him to provide documents to claim the car. Unexpectedly, a second car theft case occurred a few days later. It is also heard that the US military headquarters will consult with the garrison headquarters on how to resolve the matter of the US military police being shot and killed to seek a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Threatened US Military Police to Shoot in the Middle of the Vital Parts</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the case of US Navy Nelson being shot and killed by the young Chen Dailun, it is reported that when Nelson drove to the entrance of the Cao's Cemetery the day before yesterday, the perpetrator threatened Nelson with a gun to back up and turn around. At that time, Nelson reached back with his hand and raised his hat to signal for help to the military vehicle No. 41160 driving in front. Unexpectedly, Chen Dailun immediately fired three shots, hitting Nelson's chest and abdomen. When Chang fired a fourth shot at a Chinese military police officer sitting next to Nelson, fortunately, the military police officer was unusually alert and jumped out of the car, escaping the disaster. At the same time, three police officers in the military vehicle in front jumped out of the car. Police officer No. 8728 crouched under the south wall corner of the Cao's Cemetery and fired three shots at the vehicle where the perpetrator was sitting, one bullet hitting Chen's right side and piercing his left waist, killing him instantly. His father, Chen Shixia, went to the Longhua Police Bureau yesterday morning to handle the collection of the corpse. Bao An Tuan member Yao Kangfu (because the murder weapon came from Yao's place) has been transferred to the garrison headquarters.</p>
<h3>Jiang Gongmei's Case; Sentencing Expected Within Days</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Jiang Gongmei's corruption and illegal acts, the Military Affairs Commission previously ordered the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to handle the case strictly and report it. The headquarters organized a meeting for trial according to law and appointed Major General Li Shenzhi, a senior advisor of the Army Headquarters, as the presiding judge to preside over the joint trial. Subsequently, two evaluation meetings were held. The opinion of the police department was that Jiang was guilty of three major crimes: corruption, dereliction of duty, and embezzlement. Presiding Judge Li insisted that Jiang Gongmei's guilt was insufficient and should be declared innocent and submitted the case file to the Military Affairs Commission for review. The case has now been reviewed by the Military Affairs Commission, which believes that the original judgment was too hasty and that the investigation of the three parts of Jiang Gongmei's crimes of corruption, dereliction of duty, and embezzlement was not exhaustive. The commission returned the case for retrial. After receiving the order, the police department appointed Chief of Staff Tan Huanglin as the presiding judge, and Military Law Director Zeng Zhaoyi and Error Director Yang Jian as judges, and began the retrial on May 1. It is heard that the witness is being changed, evidence is being searched, and a judgment is expected to be made after the meeting within days and submitted to higher authorities for review.</p>
<h3>Starting From the 15th of This Month; Summer Time Will Be Implemented; Clocks Will Be Moved Forward One Hour</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received a telegram from the Executive Yuan on May 10 stating: "Upon receiving a telegram from the National Defense Supreme Committee, summer has arrived this year. From May 15 to September 30, the time on the clock will be moved forward by one hour. For example, 7 o'clock now, after the implementation of the time advance system, the time indicated on the clock and the standard time reported by various places should be 8 o'clock. All agencies, troops, schools, and social, industrial, and commercial sectors, as well as land, sea, air transportation, and communications, should implement it uniformly, etc. Please follow this order and forward it for compliance." After receiving this telegram, the municipal government, in addition to ordering its subordinates to comply, also ordered the police to implement it on schedule and advance the city's standard time by one hour.</p>
<h3>Fang Lixiang and Ye Zhihua to Be Sentenced on a Fixed Date</h3>

It is now known that the case has been scheduled for a public hearing at 9:30 AM on the 20th of this month at the North Zhejiang Road District Court. As for the lawsuit filed by lawyer Xia Gongkai and others against the Shanghai Municipal Government and its subordinate district offices, confirming the illegal election, since lawyer Xia and others have not yet specified the legal representatives of the district offices in the complaint, there has been no news of when the hearing will be held. If the above procedures are not completed within three days, the case will be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Changning and Yulin Districts to Re-elect on the 19th</h3>

<h3>Bandits Not Only Steal Car, But Also Rob Driver of Valuables</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At around 7:00 PM the night before last, two customers, one dressed in a black Zhongshan suit and the other in a Western suit, arrived at the Zhongshan Automobile Company at No. 288, Zhongzheng 2nd Road, claiming to hire a car. Driver Mao Sanqin drove a Ford sedan, license plate number 20266, for business. When they reached Fuli Li Road, two more men in Western suits got on the car and ordered it to drive to the small vegetable market near Diswei Road in Hongkou. Upon arrival, they ordered the driver to stop and wait. Two of them went into the alley for over twenty minutes, then came back together, got back in the car, and headed back towards the intersection of Fuli Li Road and Beidang Road. Three of them got out, and soon only one got back in and instructed the driver to stop at the intersection of Mainini Road and Avenue Edward VII. The driver glimpsed the two who had just gotten out waiting by the side of the road, and they got back into the car together. Before they had gone far, the men pulled out firearms and forced Mao Sanqin to retreat into the back of the car, pushed him onto the seat, covered his eyes, and forbade him from making any noise. They robbed him of a watch and 20,000 yuan in legal tender. One bandit drove the car to the vicinity of Zhongshan Road and Caoxi Road, where they threw Mao Sanqin out of the car, and the car sped away. The driver reported the incident to the Longhua Police Station at 2:00 AM the next morning, but the car had not been found as of 9:00 PM that evening.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Lixin Housing, Pan Xulun Expresses Position</h3>
<p>Pan Xulun, President of Lixin Accounting College, made the following statement to our reporter regarding the college's reclaiming of the housing on Boussy Road: "After I donated the houses at Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6, Lane 466, Boussy Road, to Lixin Accounting College, I no longer have any relationship with the current tenants in those houses. As for Lixin's lawsuit to reclaim the houses for its own use, it is all handled by the school board representing the college, and it is not my concern. It is true that the twenty or so tenants are finding it difficult to find new homes and relocate. However, in my personal capacity, I am unable to help. Recently, in addition to legal procedures, the tenants have published advertisements and news in major and minor newspapers, engaging in malicious publicity against me and the college, and much of the content is untrue. While I can certainly ignore this, the college has a large number of students and alumni, and the tenants' actions have damaged the college's reputation, inevitably arousing indignation among them. I can only urge the students to await a legal resolution peacefully. Since the tenants have already filed an appeal, I also hope they will await the court's judgment peacefully, without creating further complications outside the law, so as not to provoke the feelings of the youth."</p>

<h3>New Invention by CU Professor, Suggest Expanding Research to Promote Success. Reader Suggests Eradicating Tuberculosis and Saving Patients' Families</h3>
<p>Reader Suggests Eradicating Tuberculosis and Saving Patients' Families</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Social Services Column of Shen Bao: I read a news item on page 6 of your newspaper regarding a Taipei dispatch on the 4th, learning that Dr. Chen Lijie and others from National Taiwan University have discovered that laevorotatory lactic acid extracted from cypress wood is an effective drug for pulmonary disease. Upon hearing this, I could not help but feel elated. I believe that the rampant spread of pulmonary disease is extremely severe in our country, which is economically poor and has backward medical and health conditions. The large number of patients, the high mortality rate, the enormous economic costs, and the suffering of patients confined to their beds are all well known to the public and need no further elaboration. The seriousness of this problem is truly related to the wealth and strength of the country. Now that this invention has been discovered domestically, it must not be regarded as a local undertaking. It is appropriate to mobilize national research institutions, scientific and medical personnel to conduct joint research and strive to achieve excellence, in order to recover the huge losses caused by this disease. The central government has an unshirkable responsibility to encourage and supervise. Your newspaper, as a leader in the news industry, should inform its correspondents of such important issues, disseminate the detailed information of the new invention to the world, and awaken the attention of people across the country and the interest of scientific and medical personnel. The merits of this initiative will be abundant. I wonder if you agree? Respectfully, Shen Jiaxian, a reader, May 7, 35.</p>

<h3>Southwest Associated University Erects Stone Tablet at Original Site in Kunming to Commemorate, Professor Feng Youlan Writes Text, Professor Luo Yong Pens Script, Professor Wen Yiduo Carves Seal</h3>
<p>[Kunming Dispatch by Wood] After the graduation ceremony on the 4th of this month, Southwest Associated University erected a commemorative stone tablet at the original school site in Kunming. The tablet is stone-carved, with the text written by Professor Feng Youlan, the script penned by Professor Luo Yong, and the seal carved by Professor Wen Yiduo. The original text is more than a thousand words long. Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Southwest Associated University Commemorative Tablet - Full Text</p>
<p>On September 9, the 34th year of the Republic of China, our country accepted the surrender of Japan in Nanjing. This was eight years after the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge in the 26th year, fourteen years after the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, and fifty-one years after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. In the fifty years, Japan had devoured and nibbled at our country. Now all these territories were restored with documents, achieving a complete victory unprecedented since the Qin and Han dynasties. National Peking University and National Tsinghua University were originally located in Beiping. Nankai University was originally located in Tianjin. Since the Shenyang Incident, our country's authority gradually shifted south, but these three schools were the backbone of the cultural resistance against Japan in Peiping and Tianjin. When Peiping and Tianjin fell in the 26th year, the three schools were ordered to move to Hunan, forming the National Changsha Provisional University, with the presidents of the three schools, Jiang Menglin, Mei Yiqi, and Zhang Boling, as standing committee members in charge of school affairs. The faculties of science, engineering, and law were set up in Changsha, and the faculty of arts in South Yue, with classes starting on November 1. When Nanking and Shanghai fell and Wuhan was shaken, the Provisional University was again ordered to move to Yunnan. Teachers and students walked through Guizhou and arrived in Kunming on April 26 in the 27th year, and was then ordered to be renamed as the National Southwest Associated University. The faculty of science and engineering was located in Kunming, and the faculties of arts and law in Mengzi, with classes starting on May 4. After one semester, the faculties of arts and law also moved to Kunming. In the 27th year, a teachers college was added, and in the 29th year, a branch school was established in Xuyong, Sichuan. After one academic year, it was merged into the main campus. Kunming was originally a famous rear city, but when Japanese troops entered Annam and occupied Burma, it became an important rear base. The Associated University supported the region, graduating more than 2,000 students, and more than 800 joined the military. With the restoration of the country, the wartime mission of the Associated University was completed, and it was ordered to disband on May 4 in the 35th year. The original three schools would return to their old homes and resume their former operations. Recalling the hardships of eight years of support and the harmony of the three schools' cooperation, there are four things to commemorate: Our country, as an ancient country in the world, is located in the treasure trove of East Asia and should inherit the legacy of the Han and Tang dynasties and become a pioneer in benefiting the world. In the future, when the country is built, it will occupy a unique position in world history. The powerful nations of the world, though new, are not ancient, and Greece and Rome are ancient but not modern. Only our country is both ancient and modern, both new and old. This is what is meant by "Though Zhou is an old country, its mandate is ever new." The great cause of an era, the eight-year war of resistance, has opened its scale and laid its foundation. Today's victory has the power to reverse the course of the world for our country, and the mission of the Associated University ends with the war of resistance. This is the first thing to commemorate. Scholars have always looked down on each other, and the ancients have said so, which we share today. The three schools have different histories and different academic styles. For eight years, they cooperated seamlessly, with tolerance and mutual benefit. The five colors shone together, enhancing each other. The eight tones harmonized, ending in peace and harmony. This is the second thing to commemorate. All things grow together without harming each other, and paths proceed in parallel without conflicting with each other. Small virtues flow like streams, and great virtues cultivate. This is why heaven and earth are great. This is the true essence of democracy. The Associated University, with its spirit of inclusiveness, shifted the atmosphere of society, establishing a model of academic freedom internally and earning the title of a democratic fortress externally. It rejected the acquiescence of the many and acted as the blunt remonstrance of one. This is the third thing to commemorate. Looking back at history, if our nation cannot stand in the Central Plains, it will only be able to settle in the south. Although it is called crossing south, no one who crosses south has been able to return north: The Jin people crossing south are one example, the Song people crossing south are another example, and the Ming people crossing south are a third example. The scenery is not different, but the Jin people were deeply grieved, and the Song people deeply desired to recover the land. We were the fourth south crossing, but we were able to achieve complete recovery in less than ten years. Yu Xin did not mourn Jiangnan, and Du Fu rejoiced at the recovery of Jibei. This is the fourth thing to commemorate. The original school song of the Associated University praised the hardships of moving south and fleeing from the hardships, praised the unyielding ambition of teachers and students, and ended with the hope of final victory. The success of the school today is consistent with its original intentions, just like a contract. The beginning and end of the Associated University is not just a great event of an era, but something that will be admired for centuries to come. Therefore, we use the lyrics of the song as the inscription on the tablet, saying: "Grieving for crossing south, bid farewell to the palaces, station in Hengxiang, then depart again, embark on a long march, pass through hardship, look at the Central Plains, everywhere stained with blood, reach the distant, continue lecturing, weeping over poetry and books, still have the ancients, although the reed pipe blows, the emotions are deeper, the shame of the millennium, finally wiped away, see the enemy, like smoke disappears, rising from the north, until south of Vietnam, seeing the golden cup, already without defect, great unification, without collapse, the cause of revival, pursuing past achievements, the three schools, brothers in a line, as one body, like glue, sharing hardships, rejoicing together, the alliance ends, the mission is completed, the capital is restored, return to Yanjing, with this stone, symbolizing steadfastness, commemorate the happiness, tell the wise."</p>
<h3>Li Ji and Others Go to Japan to Investigate, Discover Chinese Cultural Relics, Meeting to Report Soon</h3>

<h3>Students of the Preparatory Class of the Capital Temporary University, The Problem of Admission Solved, Vice Minister Hang Addresses the Class, All Students Express Gratitude</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Paper] Hundreds of students in the preparatory class of the Capital Temporary University, for the problem of admission, specially delegated several representatives to go to the Ministry of Education on the 8th to petition. The students requested that the majority be guaranteed admission, but the Ministry of Education stated that there were regulations in place and could not fully comply with the students' requests. The problem could not be solved on that day. At 2:00 PM on the 9th, Vice Minister Hang Liwu of the Ministry of Education went to the auditorium of National Central University at Sipailou to address the entire class of students.</p>
<p>Continuing Classes for Two Weeks After the 17th Examination</p>
<p>He first said: After the end of World War II, our country, along with the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were demobilizing their armies, adjusting their governments, and engaging in recuperation and reconstruction. Only by maintaining peace and rebuilding could we ensure prosperity. Therefore, after the victory, the Ministry of Education sought to restore the studies of outstanding young people in the recovery areas and petitioned the Executive Yuan for funding to run the preparatory class for the Temporary University, in order to educate talents and become national pillars. The students, being nurtured and expected by the country, should concentrate on their studies. If they have any opinions on their future studies, they can submit them through the school authorities or in writing. They should not gather to run around, but cherish the precious time in class and avoid causing misunderstandings to the outside world. He continued: Central University's staff and students are advancing by land and water, and 4,000 people will come to Nanking within the current month. Therefore, the preparatory class had to end early. After the examination on the 17th, classes can continue for another two weeks to supplement knowledge.</p>
<p>Fifty Percent Can Be Guaranteed Admission to National University</p>
<p>Regarding the admission methods for preparatory class students, it was said that they would be handled in the same way as the admission methods for preparatory class students in the rear (25% of students who had been admitted for one semester would pass the entrance exam, and 50% of students who had been admitted for two semesters would pass the entrance exam). (It was found that the class had already held the first examination because the course was intensified, and it would end at the end of May, so the 50% pass method could be followed). Fifty percent could be guaranteed admission to National University, but the main subjects of liberal arts students must have a score of 70 or higher, and the main subjects of science students in mathematics, physics, and chemistry must have a score of 70 or higher to be eligible for guaranteed admission. After Vice Minister Hang finished his speech, all the students expressed their gratitude unanimously. All showed their admiration for the Vice Minister's great concern for the students. (Morning)</p>

<h3>Soviet Education System, A Model for Canada</h3>
<p>Canadian Teacher Reports to Royal Commission</p>
<p>[TASS Ottawa, 10th dispatch] Many famous Canadian teachers recently submitted a report to the Royal Commission stating that the Soviet education system is a model for Canada. Famous writer and teacher J. B. Salsberg stated in his report that the Soviet education system is the most democratic in the world, and he expressed disapproval of the management system implemented by the University of Toronto. Salsberg's report stated that the Ontario Education Council is composed of 24 people, of whom 14 are bankers and financial tycoons. In the past 25 years, tuition fees for Canadian education have increased four to five times, making it impossible for countless young men and women to enter universities. Salsberg pointed out that in the Soviet Union, students receive subsidies from the government, and he also cited statistical records of the Soviet education system since 1917. The Canada-Soviet Friendship Association submitted a memorandum stating that the facts in Canadian school textbooks were distorted, and there were unreasonable points in the ninth-grade textbooks. The report of the step-by-step worker stated that Canadian history textbooks contain pro-fascist propaganda, such as calling Mussolini "the savior of Italy," etc., and the textbooks are also full of misinterpretations of the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Money Supply Loosens, Actual Sales are Strong, Gold Market Buying Resurges, Allocation Price Increases to 1.67 Million</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday started with silver shop sales from the previous day. By the evening, the craze had intensified. Due to the political situation, people's minds are easily disturbed. The money supply has loosened, and gold prices in other areas are much higher than in this city. The buying trend has rebounded. In the morning, prices immediately broke through the 1.6 million mark due to silver shops covering their short positions. Various speculative funds poured in, and prices rose after the opening, once approaching 1.7 million around 10 o'clock. However, prices then fell back due to various sell-offs and pressure from the Central Bank, dropping back to around 1.67 million. The Central Bank then allocated 701 bars to the industry at that price. After the allocation was completed, speculative activity resumed. The stock market also had some coverage. Near noon, prices gradually rose to just below 1.72 million before seeing a pullback. Many were shaken by the Central Bank's pressure, and some took profits. At noon, prices fell back to around 1.68 million. In the afternoon, Tianjin merchants continued to buy. In the end, prices remained above the 1.7 million mark. As a result, the closing price rose by 125,000 compared to the previous day. Ornament gold was listed at 183,000. Silver ingots and silver dollars were flat. Interest rates showed a loose money supply. Shadow interest rates retreated to 1.5 to 1.8 cents.</p>
<p>The US dollar was purely driven by gold prices, following suit closely. From the opening price of 2210 yuan in the morning, it gradually rose to 2350 yuan. Prices fell back to within 2300 yuan at noon. Due to the passive nature of the market, swap spreads opened up to above 735 yuan. In the afternoon, prices were still slightly driven up by gold prices. As a result, the closing price rose by 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar market was volatile, with limited funds. Prices once rose to above 420 yuan. In the end, prices closed up 20 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were 415 yuan to 425 yuan. Rubles were traded at 525 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise in Unison, Raw Cotton Trading Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became stable due to the sudden rise in gold prices, which boosted people's morale considerably. In the early morning, all yarn prices rose in unison, especially 42-count doubled yarn. Because the Textile Construction Company listed prices yesterday without any supply, the same industry's thoughts rose sharply. Blue Phoenix once traded at 1.93 to 1.94 million. The closing price fell slightly to 1.93 million, but still rose by 100,000 compared to yesterday. The remaining 20-count yarn rose by about 10,000, and 16-count yarn rose by 20,000. Transactions were very scarce.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton telegram reported a decline of 12 to 29 pounds. The near-term US dollar was 27.40, the long-term was 27.53, and the Middling spot price was 28.07. Raw cotton trading in this port declined because it was Saturday. Although the gold and cloth markets were booming, manufacturers were watching and waiting, with no inquiries. Only the same industry made some embellishments.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Company Sells Off as Much as Possible, Rayon Prices Look Weak, Factory-Made Silk Fabrics All Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market did not make any price due to the Textile Construction Company's opening of goods. Outside the market, No. 120 Tianqiao shouted a price of 1.33 million yuan. The opening prices of the Central Textile Company were 1.07 million yuan for No. 120 Peacock Earth, 1.12 million yuan for No. 120 Silver Bird, and 1.21 million yuan for No. 150 Golden Three Horses. The prices for bright and semi-bright were the same. More than 200 rayon companies opened more than 600 boxes in total. It is said that the Central Textile Company opens goods once every Saturday. After this, rayon market prices may be difficult to look good. There were not many factory-made transactions. Due to the rise in gold prices, user silk prices all rose by about 50,000 yuan. The silk fabric market was quite active yesterday. Dachang checkered crepe rose by 100 yuan per yard. Meiya quilts also rose by 120,000 yuan per 100 pieces.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Leaf Supply is Smooth</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] More than 2,000 barrels of American tobacco leaves were imported this week. Dalian and Qingdao in China have received large quantities of shipments. The Jiangxin ship also arrived from Hankou the day before yesterday, carrying more than 2,440 pieces of tobacco leaves, 360 pieces of mechanical cotton, and 860 pieces of yellow and white linen. A large amount of miscellaneous grain was also shipped to Shantou. The China Merchants Bureau Hai Min ship will depart today, sailing to Xiamen and Shantou, carrying 33,300 pieces of bean cakes, more than 1,470 bags of soybeans, 885 pieces of peanut cakes, more than 28,400 bags of bran, more than 500 bags of fertilizer powder, 250 pieces of tobacco leaves, 350 pieces of cotton yarn, and 80 pieces of piece goods to Shantou. It will also carry 3,000 pieces of bean cakes, 100 bags of soybeans, and 185 pieces of cotton yarn to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trading Declines</h3>
<p>Recently, Tianjin merchants have once again shown interest in new Hangzhou Qiang teas. In order to facilitate selection, it is heard that the merchants will soon go to the production area to absorb them. As for Wenzhou Qiang teas, the supply from the source is still continuous. However, the quality is getting lower and lower, so the market continues to be unsustainable. Currently, the price has fallen by nearly 140,000 yuan per dan, but some owners are still eager to sell off. Therefore, sales are also made at 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. Since the buying interest from all parties has progressed continuously, other varieties have reached a considerable level. Therefore, those who inquire have become more and more few. However, the holders' thoughts are not discouraged, so their base remains firm.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Gradually Decline; Stock Market Greatly Weakened</h3>
<p>The public bond market situation is bewildering. Some financial institutions released their high-priced inventory, and large investors turned around and let go. The "Unified C" bond gradually declined from 75.50 yuan. Northern capital flowed towards gold, breaking the 65.00 yuan mark midway before gradually stabilizing. It closed 400 yuan lower than the previous closing. Grades A and B fell 550 yuan, Grade D fell 600 yuan, and Grade E fell 650 yuan. Chinese stocks, like startled birds, found it difficult to recover their vitality in the short term. Furthermore, with the fluctuating gold market, floating capital scattered. At the opening, some promise was shown, with Wing Spinning at 53.80 yuan, Mei Ya at 45.00 yuan, Jingfu at 3.75 yuan, New Guang at 3.15 yuan, and Qin Xing at 2.80 yuan, but then they could not sustain the momentum. Near noon, Wing Spinning fell to 49.00 yuan, Mei Ya to 40.50 yuan, Jingfu to 3.40 yuan, New Guang to 2.85 yuan, and Qin Xing to 2.40 yuan. Rong Feng, which had reigned supreme for several days, also found it difficult to maintain its position at 13.40 yuan, ending the morning session with a half-percent decline. After a weak noon session, there was a slight rebound. The final results, compared to the previous close, showed Wing Spinning, Mei Ya, Jingfu, and New Guang each down half a percent, while Qin Xing fell slightly less than one percent. Except for small stocks, which remained stable, most unpopular stocks declined slightly. Foreign stocks completely assimilated with Chinese stocks. Yi Spinning initially struggled above the previous closing price, but securities firms were unable to support it, and popular stocks were the first to collapse. Unpopular stocks were also dragged down. Near noon, low prices appeared across the board. As a result, all stocks fell by about half a percent compared to the previous close. The paper industry was already cold and musty; once holders were eager to sell, market prices immediately dropped by slightly less than twenty percent.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Industry and Textile Construction Agree on Improvement Measures; Open for Business as Usual Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market operated as usual yesterday. Textile Construction was scheduled to open for the sale of cloth yesterday, but although price lists were posted as usual, no cloth merchants went to place orders. According to news from the Cotton Cloth Association, its responsible persons continued discussions with the responsible persons of Textile Construction yesterday, and agreed on the following: (1) Opening for business should strive for universality and fairness; Textile Construction should immediately compile statistics for constant reference to ensure appropriate distribution. (2) The order collection time should be appropriately extended to avoid insufficient time for processing. (3) Staff should be added to the order and allocation departments to provide convenience to customers. (4) Inventory management should be centralized to ensure prompt and appropriate calculation of supply and demand. (5) The problem of delayed tax bills and multiple households signing a single bill should be addressed by Textile Construction with the Commodity Tax Bureau for improvement. (6) Opening procedures should be continuously improved. The responsible persons of both the Association and Textile Construction will maintain contact in the future. Based on the results of these discussions, the Association has issued a notice to all members, stating that starting on Monday, the 13th, the Textile Construction opening will resume as usual. It is heard that some directors of the Association have expressed their intention to resign, which is likely to happen. As for the distribution offices of Textile Construction, the Association will also initiate an organization to provide operational convenience to all industry peers and brokers, so that everyone can share the benefits.</p>
<h3>Canada's Foreign Loans; China Accounts for 60 Million</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Ottawa, 11th] According to US dollars (excluding Britain), China accounts for one hundred and sixty million US dollars. A list is issued below regarding the amount and term of the loans: (Unit: Millions of US Dollars)</p>
<h3>Trends in World Gold and Silver Prices; Although US Authorities Exert All Efforts to Prevent Rises; Popular Belief Likely to Follow, Square Market</h3>
<p>[Reuter's London, 11th] According to a Reuter's reporter, knowledgeable gold industry figures here firmly believe that the prices of sterling and the dollar against gold and silver will rise to higher levels in Europe and the East, especially silver. As far as gold is concerned, once the price rises, it will be a devaluation of sterling and the dollar. US and British authorities have not yet taken steps to do so. The US gold price is set at $35 an ounce, and the sterling-dollar exchange rate is also fixed, so the sterling price of gold, at 172 shillings and 3 pence, clearly cannot rise except for slight adjustments.</p>
<p>The US Treasury's opposition to raising the price of gold may stem similar trends elsewhere, but when the US faces its future recession (which most observers believe is only a matter of time), fears of current inflation turning into deflation may change things entirely. A senior official at the US Treasury, involved in the Bretton Woods monetary agreement, also opposes raising the price of gold, arguing that "the US Treasury believes that future changes in the dollar against gold should be based on the principles stipulated in the Bretton Woods Agreement," rather than the reason that there should be no changes in the price of gold. Although the official price of silver in London is currently set at 44 pence per ounce, its "free market" price is 58 to 60 pence per ounce. Recently, the free market price reached a peak of 68 pence per ounce. Although it has not yet reached Eastern levels, the upward trend suggests it is not far off.</p>
<h3>Lightest Woolen Fabric; Weighs Only One Ounce Per Yard</h3>
<p>British Information Service, London, 11th - A manufacturer in London has produced the lightest woolen fabric, weighing only one ounce per yard. It was invented by research staff in Leeds: using a seaweed-based thread as a guide thread, folded together with pure wool; this seaweed guide thread dissolves in a mild alkaline solution. After weaving, once washed, it leaves the purest woolen fabric. The woolen fabric made with this new method has unprecedentedly beautiful drape, structure, and form, and its future development is unpredictable. Unfortunately, current production is not high, and it cannot yet be exported.</p>
<h3>Wusong Fishing Season; Dense Masts at Wenzaobang</h3>
<p>The spring yellow croaker market in Wusong is a major business for the local area. During this period, the market is twice as lively. The first batch of fishing boats have arrived successively over the past two days, totaling more than 150, so the masts in Wenzaobang are densely packed. After completing customs inspection and tax payment procedures, unloading began in the afternoon yesterday for sales ashore. This year, there are about 20 fish merchants for resale, including Xiexinggong, Baofeng, Tongli, Gongdaxiang, and Hengtai. The opening price for yellow croaker is 42,000 yuan per zu, and dried fish is 74,000 yuan per dan. Merchants from various inland areas are actively coming to Song to purchase goods, and hotels are fully booked.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Italian Raw Silk Expand to the US</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Tokyo, 11th] Nine thousand bales of Japanese raw silk of all grades are scheduled to arrive in the United States in May.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Milan, 10th] The export of Italian raw silk has gradually returned to normal. In the first 20 days of March, Italy exported a total of 713,921 kilograms of raw silk, of which the United States received 242,221 kilograms, Argentina 4,800 kilograms, the United Kingdom 500 kilograms, and Switzerland 466,400 kilograms.</p>
<h3>The More Anxious People Become, The More Urgent Their Needs; Rice Prices Continue to Rise; How Can The Poor Survive! It is Heard That Grain Loans Are Decided to Be Temporarily Ended</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was very active, with supply falling short of demand. Japonica and indica rice continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, approaching the 50,000 yuan mark. Flour from Shantou and Xiamen was selling quite well, soaring by 2,000 yuan. Soybeans also rose by more than 2,000 yuan due to inquiries from Fujian and Zhejiang. Bean cakes, purchased by merchants from Nanyang, also rose by 500 to 600 yuan. Bran, selling well in rural areas, continued to rise by 400 to 500 yuan. Raw peanuts also increased by 1,000 yuan. Red beans, active but not strong in Hong Kong, rose by 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 1,000 yuan. The oil market, with strong domestic demand and inquiries from Ningbo merchants, rose another 2,000 yuan. According to the rice market, yesterday's rice arrivals in this city totaled more than 2,700 shi, with the following types and quantities: White japonica 1,210, sheep indica 245, thin rice 425, Du indica 388, early rice 443.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the imposition of military grain collection restrictions on the export of rice in Kunshan, Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, and other rice-producing areas along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the rice market in this city has been agitated and broke through the 50,000 yuan mark yesterday. Vice Minister of Food Pang Songzhou made a special trip from Beijing to Shanghai to convene food merchants to discuss and determine emergency measures to stabilize rice prices. First, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will send giant transports to Vietnam to load 200,000 tons of foreign rice to Shanghai. At the same time, the Bean and Rice Industry Association will be allowed to freely purchase from the Beijing-Shanghai rice-producing areas based on the certificates issued, and the purchased rice will be limited to public sale in the market. It is heard that the first phase of grain loan rice, 30,000 zu, has already been shipped to Shanghai, and 5,000 dan were sold yesterday morning. Together with the 9,000 dan sold previously, a total of 14,000 zu have been sold. The rest will be sold in succession. This period of grain loan rice will be temporarily ended, and all loans will be recovered to avoid misunderstandings. The distribution of the profit surplus from the grain loan rice is still awaiting consideration and decision by the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>It was previously rumored that the Qinglian Pavilion rice market on Fourth Malu Road would restore north-south market transactions. According to the rice market, there is no possibility of change for the time being, because the north-south rice markets were concentrated sales areas for rice from Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, and other rice-producing areas in Jiangsu Province before the war, and they have been destroyed by Japanese artillery fire and are not easy to repair and restore to their original state.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Questions Regarding Commodity Tax and Nutrition Tax; Explanation from the Jiangsu Commodity Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read the article "Commodity Tax and Business Tax Issues in the Dyeing and Weaving Industry" written by Mr. Zhu Shangyi, published in your newspaper on the 6th of this month. The explanation of tax principles is detailed and precise, which is sufficient to dispel public doubts. However, the last paragraph of this article, regarding the current collection of unified tax on cotton yarn and export declaration procedures, slightly deviates from the facts. Our Bureau is responsible for tax administration and cannot remain silent. The following is a brief description based on the provisions of the regulations:</p>
<p>(1) The current unified tax on cotton yarn is levied on cotton yarn at the factory, calculated according to the approved unified tax price. Cotton cloth was originally exempt from tax. However, because larger yarn factories often have weaving workshops attached, the raw materials used are all taken from the factory itself. Since this yarn for weaving is not moved outside the factory, it should not be taxed according to the principle of factory tax. Therefore, the current regulations for collecting unified tax on cotton yarn stipulate that when cotton yarn is transferred from the spinning workshop to the weaving workshop in yarn factories with weaving workshops attached, the unified tax will not be collected temporarily. After the yarn is made into woven products and packaged for leaving the factory, the unified tax will be supplemented on the woven products. The tax standard is also specified, and the tax will be collected ad valorem according to the weight of the yarn content. Tax authorities have always handled matters in accordance with the regulations, and there have never been any extra levies. However, in order to make the cargo correspond to the certificate, the name of the commodity is filled in as "cotton cloth" in the product name column of the tax certificate, which generally misleads people to think that the unified tax on cotton cloth is collected. They do not know that it is actually a supplementary tax on yarn. As for the woven products produced by pure weaving factories, since their raw materials are already taxed cotton yarn, there is also a method for pure weaving factories to exchange their finished products directly woven from cotton yarn for transport permits. With the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate or distribution certificate, the number of woven finished products that can be produced can be exchanged for a pure weaving factory cotton yarn directly woven finished product transport permit for transportation. There is no fee and no additional unified tax on cotton cloth is levied.</p>
<p>(2) The methods for collecting taxes and issuing certificates for the woven products produced by each factory have been described above. Therefore, anyone holding these goods should transport them with a certificate, and the same applies when declaring for export. For those who report for transportation in whole batches, they can immediately present the original tax certificate or transport permit for inspection. If they are transported in separate batches, they can hold the original tax certificate or transport permit and apply to the local tax authorities for a distribution permit (the distribution permit method is still the same) before submitting it for verification. However, the reporting location must be consistent with the destination filled on the certificate to avoid ambiguity. This method has been in place for many years and has not been inconvenient.</p>
<p>The above two points are the actual situation regarding cotton cloth in the current cotton yarn unified tax laws and regulations, which is inconsistent with what you learned from rumors in the article. I am afraid that readers will not understand and cause misunderstandings, so I specially wrote a letter to clarify and hope that your newspaper will publish it in the letters to the editor column to clarify the truth. Thank you very much.</p>

<h3>Weeping as He Recounts That Taiwan Has Been Mute for Fifty Years; Now Reveals Shadows of The Past</h3>
<p>— Twilight Clouds, Our Correspondent in Taiwan Via Air Mail on The 5th</p>
<p>Just as what is displayed in the Taipei Provincial Museum, Taipei City was once a desolate market town fifty years ago. At the end of the late Qing Dynasty, the urban area was purely Southern Chinese indigenous architecture with mud roads and rubble. However, fifty years later, Taipei has leapt to become a modern and new-style city. In between, the trajectory of development from an ancient city to a darling of the times can be traced. One hundred and twenty years ago, the popular Taiwanese proverb was: "First Tainan Prefecture, second Lugang, third Mengjia." This means that the most prosperous was Tainan Prefecture, followed by Lugang, and then Mengjia. Mengjia, a collection and distribution point for ships relying on the Tamsui River, is Taipei City's Wanhua, and still retains ancient shadows. People strolling in the urban area can catch a glimpse of the city wall surrounded by betel nut trees at the end of the wide asphalt roads. That is the site of the city wall that took two years to complete after the Imperial Commissioner Shen Baozhen, during the reign of Qing Emperor Guangxu, memorialized that the Taiwan Prefecture be moved from Taichung to Taipei, and Prefect Chen Xingju raised 200,000 taels of silver. The one-mile perimeter was dismantled by the Japanese to build wide roads. Now, the four city gates - Jingfu Gate (East Gate), Lizheng Gate (South Gate), Chengen Gate (North Gate), and Chongxi Gate (Small South Gate) - have smiling faces as the May wind blows. The Japanese never thought that this monument, which touched national sentiments, would trigger a huge wave of resistance.</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed local elders, who frequently recounted the events of fifty-one years ago, and tearfully traced the suffering experienced during the long nights. As soon as they closed their eyes, it was as if they were standing in front of the Prefect they had seen in their youth, with a red-tasselled hat, a string of beads in front of his chest, court attire, and a dignified and stern face. They loved to watch the court sessions and the trials of prisoners, and they also loved to watch the scenery when the drums and gongs, flag-bearers, umbrella-bearers, and bearers carrying the large sedan chair passed by when leaving the yamen.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, they had been to Japan, as well as to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hong Kong and other places in China. They did not believe that China's science was inferior to theirs at that time, but that education was not widespread due to internal unrest. The biggest pain they felt was the difference in treatment by the Japanese towards the Taiwanese during the fifty years of occupation. In addition to being loyal to personal duties, they did not help or ask about external affairs. Six million people were like mutes, unable to complain about their suffering or speak their minds under high-pressure control. They said: The Japanese in Taiwan used forceful means and the qualifications of bandits to build. The warlords and traitors have buried their motherland. If they do not give up imperialism and remain hegemonic and incorrigible, it will be difficult to revive even after twenty years.</p>
<p>Having been mutes for fifty years in the face of reality, the elderly who are now speaking up said: In the early stages, it is inevitable to seek comprehensiveness. In short, there are gentlemen and villains everywhere. If the Taiwanese have the ambition to look at the vastness of the world, why should they limit themselves to serving in Taiwan? They are sixty-four years old this year, with ancestral roots in Zhangzhou, and come from a scholarly family. They can recite the Four Books and Five Classics, and can also write pure literary Chinese. They said that the Taiwanese will not forget the national language. The Japanese promoted the national language here for thirty years before it became popular, but the Minnan dialect still cannot be eliminated. Even in their own case, they learned the national language for six months when they went to the mainland, and after a decade or two, they can now review and learn anew and are able to cope with it.</p>
<p>Under the ancient city walls, we discovered true patriots who spent their youth in tears. The second generation seems to have forgotten them. But the reporter thinks that it is necessary to strive for and resonate with those who respect the elderly. Only they understand the country best, and also understand Taiwan best. The vigorous shadow is precisely the only vitality left on the ground.</p>
<h3>Taipei Night Flute</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Taiwan Via Air Mail</p>
<p>The night in Taipei City is exactly the opposite of the daytime, carrying the coolness of early autumn. Indoors, nestled in a small room, one can smell the fragrance of jasmine and the osmanthus flowers of August. On the quiet streets, you can hear the sounds of wooden clogs with Japanese customs, occasionally mixed with the night songs of flutists (i.e., masseuses), whose tones are heart-stirring. They will stir up homesickness in travelers who have traveled across the ocean, they are male and female blind people looking for food for tomorrow on the fringes of life.</p>
<p>The bustling street that controls Taipei's economic lifeline is Dadaocheng (now the area around Yanping Road). As the lights come on, the sound of guessing games and orders from restaurants, mixed with the laughter of women under the pressure of life, wafts over. People will exchange all their income for the price of a laugh that they can afford; if not, they go to one of the three dance halls and pay thirty yuan to dance ten dances, holding the waist of a local dancer wearing a tall cheongsam. People from the mainland say that it is too boring to come to Taiwan, the economic foundation cannot be established, life feels pitiful, there is no future for a career, so why not find some stimulation. More than fifty dancers and tens of thousands of waitresses are forced to make a half-laughing life under the pressure of life. The deformed prosperity of the night has grown, like the crazy scene during the war.</p>
<p>In fact, the most mysterious and seductive is Mengjia. In the past, Mengjia was a collection and distribution point for junks carrying camphor, tea and other local products. The towering masts and the merchants coming and going intertwined to form the prosperous face of this street along the banks of the Tamsui River. This is the base camp of the Han Chinese from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian. Mengjia's coat is draped in the dazzling and seductive color of mystery, but at the bottom, it is full of a pure Chinese ancient flavor. In the back streets, in the small South Chinese-style pigeon coops, the gods and Buddhas they believe in include the famous Longshan Temple, Zushi Temple, and Mazu Temple of Tianhou Temple, etc., and the incense fires are endless throughout the year. Under the dim electric lights at night, you can see the backs of girls dragging wooden clogs, carrying small bags, and smiling sadly as they return home lazily. At the same time, you can also find devout men and women burning incense, lighting candles, and kowtowing in temples late at night; especially Nengshan Temple, a famous temple built in the third year of Qianlong, has become a spiritual place for the people of this province. When you first come here, it is difficult for you to believe that this is already more than a thousand miles overseas from Jiangnan, because the mood is no different from that of Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou and Chenghuang Temple in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wandering here, you will believe that this is a manifestation of the deep potential of the Chinese nation! The Japanese have ruled Taiwan for so many years, and they have squeezed the flesh and blood of the islanders, but they have not taken away their hearts. In the old styles of life and houses, people feel how much the Japanese looked down on the people of this province!</p>
<p>In the area near Nengshan Temple and the Tamsui River, summer is an excellent place to escape the heat. You can call for a boat, float on the river, and greet the cool night breeze, letting go of the noise of the city. But now there are prostitutes selling smiles, waiting for people looking for physical comfort in the black curtain of the night. Thousands of local women are now secretly prostituting themselves under the iron whip of life. They are scattered in the low corners of houses, leaving traces of past romances, Japanese geisha houses...</p>
<p>The short flute of the blind is played in turn, like a New Year's Eve serenade, and the sad melody tells the high-altitude life of lament. The people of ancient China are eagerly awaiting the dawn after liberation! Daybreak!</p>
<h3>The Grain-Producing Area Eats Vegetables for Meals! The Grain Shortage in Hunan is Becoming Increasingly Severe</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Changsha Correspondent, Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>The severity of the disaster in Hunan has been reported to readers by this newspaper several times. Recently, the price of grain in Changsha has risen by 20,000 yuan per stone, causing social unrest. The situation in various counties has worsened, leading to frequent reports of people being forced to commit suicide by drowning or hanging. Even in Changde, a grain-producing area, people are eating vegetables for meals, and the city is filled with starving people, creating a dire situation. If effective relief is not provided quickly, the situation will become unmanageable.</p>
<p>Wishful Thinking Was Not Accurate Enough</p>
<p>The serious grain situation in Hunan has long been recognized by all parties, but relying on the idea of "relying on heaven for food," no concrete measures have been taken. From mid-March to mid-April, the grain price remained stable, and there were several rains, raising the river water level by several feet. The rice price remained around 29,000 yuan, not exceeding 20,000 yuan, so everyone felt relieved. Former Chairman Wu Qiwu brought news from Chongqing that 400,000 stones of surplus grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi would be used to aid Hunan. Furthermore, approval was obtained for the Joint Treasury to issue 500 million yuan in grain loans to Hunan and 1 billion yuan in agricultural loans. In addition, the purchase price of military grain was increased. With this series of good news, everyone thought there was a solution and that the grain price would fall. So everyone waited for the surplus grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi to arrive, thinking the problem would be solved. Little did they know that their wishful thinking was wrong, and the grain price fluctuated sharply in three days, causing social unrest. The people, who had been relieved for a month, felt a great weight on their hearts again.</p>
<p>On April 15th, the rice price rose from 28,000 yuan to 32,000 yuan per stone in one day, an increase of 4,000 yuan. On the 16th, it rose another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, and on the 17th, it was even worse, jumping over 40,000 yuan. The situation worsened on the 18th and 19th, reaching 48,000 yuan. In just three or four days, the price almost doubled. The poor are crying, society is agitated, and newspapers are shouting.</p>
<p>City Council Willing to Curb Rising Prices</p>
<p>At the height of the price surge, the Changsha City Council took the lead in petitioning the provincial government, demanding measures to curb the rising prices. They also suggested investigating the amount of grain stored in the city's warehouses and requested price stabilization measures. The first measure was adopted by the city government, which immediately joined relevant parties and representatives of the rice industry to conduct a household-by-household investigation. The investigation revealed that the grain stored in Changsha's warehouses was only about 50,000 stones, enough to supply the city's people for only three or four days. This proved that the reserves were indeed small, and the supply was limited by transportation, preventing smooth distribution. The second measure was to have the People's Grain Company organize price stabilization sales. Of course, doing something is always better than doing nothing. However, preparations took time, and it only started after half a month. Each person could buy five liters of rice per day at 90% of the market price, or 360 yuan per liter.</p>
<p>After the city councilors' petition, news released by the Central News Agency stated that the soaring grain prices in Changsha were due to "certain powerful figures" purchasing large quantities of grain in the city and transporting it south, thus stimulating grain prices. The Central Daily News also had similar reports, and the Dagong Daily's editorial on the 17th, titled "Bureaucratic Capital Manipulating Rice Prices," also stated that recently "the residence of a certain magnate" had frequent dealings with local grain merchants, purchasing 50,000 stones of grain for transport south. Thus, the "certain powerful figures" and "the residence of a certain magnate" caused social unrest, and it seemed that someone was about to be revealed. Common people were astonished by the "certain powerful figures" and "the brother of a certain magnate."</p>
<p>Provincial Government Orders Secret Investigation of Grain Purchases</p>
<p>Provincial Chairman Wu Qiwu held a press conference on the 20th specifically to discuss the grain issue. All department heads attended except Yang Ruiling, the head of the Finance Department and concurrently head of the Provincial Food and Grain Department. Yang Ruiling sent Tao Chongzhou, the deputy head of the Food and Grain Department, as his representative. Chairman Wu reported on the provincial government's measures to address the grain price problem, first mentioning the purchase of military grain and then the methods for relieving the grain shortage. The conclusion was still to rush the transportation of grain from Sichuan.</p>
<p>Tao Chongzhou, the deputy head of the Food and Grain Department, became the target of numerous questions at the press conference. Tao seemed unable to cope. Tao said that the recent surge in grain prices was unexpected, and predicted that there would likely be further increases. Someone asked him that since he did not know about the price increase beforehand, it was understandable, but now that he knew it would rise in the future, did the Food and Grain Department have appropriate measures? Tao replied with the phrase "matters of confidentiality" to avoid answering.</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called "powerful figures" issue, the former chairman had mentioned that the newspapers were making insinuations and hoped that facts could be presented for severe punishment. An order was issued that day to all relevant agencies to secretly investigate the price situation of the so-called "powerful figures" purchasing grain, with a deadline of three days for reporting. However, after three days, there was still no information, and the rice price was still rising, reaching 50,000 yuan on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Changsha and the various counties could not bear such increases. The rapid spread of the price surge exceeded all records. It reached 70,000 yuan in Hengyang and 55,000 yuan in Changde, and Changde was a rice-producing area. Considering how high the prices were, the situation in other places could be imagined.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, the Hunan grain shortage was mostly due to a lack of supply, but human factors were also significant. Taking the rural areas of Changsha and Xiangtan as examples: the price of grain in the countryside was 18 yuan in silver dollars per stone (each silver dollar worth 1,000 yuan in legal tender), and it was still difficult to buy, which was absolutely true. This proved that the production was indeed insufficient to meet consumption. As for human factors, there were many reasons.</p>
<p>County-Level Measures Not Implemented Thoroughly</p>
<p>The central government had stipulated that military grain should be purchased based on the average price on March 15th, and Hunan's set price was 12,000 yuan. The people originally had nothing to say, but the Food and Grain Department, which was responsible for purchasing military grain, deducted the money they had previously earned from purchasing military grain in the new price, so the actual amount issued was less than 12,000 yuan. Furthermore, after several transfers at the county level, the actual amount received by the people was even further from the stipulated amount. As a result, those who refused to sell were arrested, and many villagers were forced to commit suicide by drowning or hanging. The county level did not thoroughly implement the purchase measures, reflecting the failure of government orders. The original measures were to purchase grain along with the taxes, but later it was modified to target large households. Of course, only those with land were eligible, but at the county level, the substance changed. The county government changed the measures, regardless of poverty or wealth, imposing an equal levy. The poor, who had no means of survival, were also allocated quotas, even if it was only three or five liters. They were forced to sell their children to buy rice to pay, causing widespread resentment. As a result, living costs rose, and grain prices could not help but rise. This was one of the human factors.</p>
<p>Substituting Vegetables for Rice to Save it for Military Grain</p>
<p>Changde was originally a rice-producing area, but the recent situation was also very bad. The county was assigned to purchase 120,000 stones of military grain, leading to empty warehouses. Officials had no stored grain, and the people had no surplus grain. The Provincial Food and Grain Department even ordered the county government to transport 250,000 catties of rice to Zhijiang and another 600,000 catties to supply the Fifth Army passing through. As a result, every household in the city and countryside was assigned grain, and grain was urged from door to door. Even street vendors were not spared. The commissioner and county magistrate went to the countryside to urge collection, and the whole county was in turmoil. The troops had to eat, so the people had to starve. In places like Shigongqiao and Deshanhefu, nine out of ten families were eating vegetables for meals, saving rice to supply the troops. Furthermore, due to the spring drought, there was no rain, making it impossible to transplant rice seedlings. Conflicts over water, suicides due to lack of rice, and other such incidents were rampant.</p>
<p>Political Relief is More Important than Material Relief</p>
<p>These were all human factors. Therefore, political relief in Hunan was even more important than material relief. Mr. Yao Xuehuai, the deputy director of the Hunan Relief Sub-Office, accompanied Mr. Hoffman, the head of the Joint Relief's Hunan office, and a reporter from Life magazine on an inspection tour of various counties. Upon returning to Changsha, he told reporters that some people were using special powers to collude in various ways, forcibly buying grain, and manipulating profits, thus stimulating grain prices. Poor political governance at the grassroots level greatly hindered relief efforts. Many Baojia heads, regardless of whether the people were suffering from disaster, improperly levied donations and relentlessly oppressed them. Therefore, Mr. Yao emphasized the importance of political relief, believing that if political solutions were not found, even abundant material resources would be of no avail.</p>
<p>Fair levies and fair distribution were urgently needed in the current situation in Hunan. Nothing should be done deceptively anymore. Only by working practically and earnestly can there be a solution. The Joint Relief provided Hunan with 50 million yuan in grain loans. The provincial government organized a Hunan Provincial People's Food Adjustment Committee to manage it, but the Joint Treasury deducted 200 million yuan that had previously been lent to Changsha and Hengyang counties, so there were only 300 million yuan in reality. We do not understand the reasoning behind this, and it seems that the calculations were too precise.</p>
<p>The Hunan Provincial People's Food Adjustment Committee has been established for nearly two months, and although it has 300 million yuan in funds to use, the Changsha branch of the Joint Treasury is still requesting instructions on the loan method, so it has not yet received the loan. The actual amount used is still the remaining 200 million yuan from the 1945 Civil Servants' Living Subsidy, so it has not had a major effect.</p>
<h3>Cultural Barriers in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Correspondent, Lin Youlan</p>
<p>Hong Kong's cultural circles, including people from all walks of life, and the special environment in which they are located, make their expressions quite complex and worth discussing. Recently, at a dinner hosted by Li Dachao, head of the Hong Kong and Macau branch of the Kuomintang, a representative of the Chinese-language Wah Tze Yat Po discovered that the host of the Overseas Chinese Daily, who had collaborated with the enemy during the occupation of Hong Kong, was also invited. He immediately walked out to protest. This is the latest storm in Hong Kong's cultural circles, and there is a story behind this storm:</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Daily Transforms Itself</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Daily is the only Hong Kong newspaper that, after Japan's surrender, transformed itself from praising the Japanese invaders and puppet government to flattering the Allied forces and caring for the motherland. In fact, the Overseas Chinese Daily is not the only newspaper that was published during the occupation of Hong Kong and still exists today. The most prominent is the Sing Tao Daily (formerly the Heung To Daily during the occupation), but its publisher returned to the motherland some years ago and rushed to Hong Kong after the war. People generally appreciate his intention to reform and are unwilling to dwell on his past.</p>
<p>Distinguishing Loyalty from Treachery</p>
<p>After the publication of the Kuomintang Daily by the Central Propaganda Department, Hong Kong finally had a newspaper that clearly distinguished right from wrong. This spring, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily republished with the slogan "Endure four years of sacrifice, maintain twenty years of glory." The righteous banner suddenly gained momentum. The distinction between loyalty and treachery was clear. The Overseas Chinese Daily, in contrast, felt a chill.</p>
<p>Seizing Weaknesses and Acting Recklessly</p>
<p>In order to reverse its decline, the Overseas Chinese Daily supported the resumption of publication of the Chung Wan Yat Po (originally called the Tung Ah Evening Post during the occupation), treating it as an ally and echoing each other. At the same time, it launched the Hong Kong Mail, creating a new front and planning for a possible retreat. It also sought to win over various parties, cultivate goodwill, and flatter the British while feigning obedience to the motherland and showing concern. Under the special circumstances of Hong Kong, our authorities in Hong Kong respect the laws of friendly nations and cannot exert full force. The Overseas Chinese Daily seized on this point, acting recklessly and doing whatever it pleased, using the inscriptions of important party and state officials as a guise to deceive overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Releasing Air and Reorganizing</p>
<p>The Wah Tze Yat Po began republishing this month and took it upon itself to work against traitors. Shortly after its publication, it wrote an article advocating the punishment of Cen, the host of the Overseas Chinese Daily, and submitted it to the Guangdong provincial party, government, military, and relevant departments, requesting strict handling. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Overseas Chinese Daily recently rehired Zhang, the editor-in-chief from before the war, and released news of reorganizing internally. It was during this period that Director Li suddenly hosted a tea party for the press, and the Overseas Chinese Daily was among those invited, which led to the protest by the Wah Tze Yat Po. How our authorities will deal with the Overseas Chinese Daily, which collaborated with the enemy, is currently being watched by the cultural circles here.</p>
<p>Two Camps Do Not Interact</p>
<p>Recently, a reporter who came to Hong Kong from the mainland attended a Hong Kong cultural gathering and was surprised to find that there were very few people present. He could not help but ask, "Why are there so few cultural figures in Hong Kong?" This reporter did not know the inside story of Hong Kong's cultural circles. The "distinction between loyalty and treachery" mentioned above has divided the cultural circles into two distinct camps, glaring at each other and not interacting.</p>
<p>The Left-Wing Strides Forward</p>
<p>There are also some left-wing figures who claim to be progressive and stride forward, as if everyone is their enemy except for comrades who recognize the Soviet Union as their own country. This attitude naturally makes it impossible to work together harmoniously. Therefore, more than half a year has passed since the British army retook Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's cultural circles have not yet had any concrete work performance. Even a journalists' association cannot be formed.</p>
<p>Strengthening Unity and Opposing Indifference</p>
<p>In the future, how can Hong Kong's cultural circles unite to fulfill their duties to the country?</p>
<p>Most Hong Kong overseas Chinese are focused on doing business, and some even consider it noble not to talk about politics. Therefore, they often ignore the government's words and echo those who oppose the government, without distinguishing right from wrong.</p>
<p>Yellow Tabloids Relapse</p>
<p>In addition to left-wing newspapers that specialize in scolding and provoking, there are also yellow tabloids that specialize in discussing romance and teaching obscenity and theft. Currently, those tabloids are the only ones that can truly be economically self-sufficient in Hong Kong. Last month, the Hong Kong authorities summoned seven yellow newspapers for their "offensive morality" and gave them serious warnings, but their managers relapsed as soon as they left the government office, and the erotic content in their newspapers has not changed even a little. Many overseas Chinese also indulge in those romantic journals. Hong Kong's cultural circles are now filled with various toxins. How to eliminate those toxins is certainly worthy of everyone's consideration.</p>
<p>Educational Institutions in Stagnation</p>
<p>After three years and eight months of Japanese rule in Hong Kong, social atmosphere is going downhill, and educational institutions are completely at a standstill. Adults are shameless and pursue fame and profit. Children are out of school, using communication with foreigners instead of textbooks. Since the recovery, everything is waiting to be revived, and the restoration of cultural organizations and overseas Chinese schools has not reached a perfect state. Everyone is looking forward to a vigorous Hong Kong cultural movement.</p>
<h3>Viewing Japanese Prisoners Repairing Roads: 40-Kilometer Project Completed</h3>
<p>— Nanjing Dispatch, May 6, Wei Wang</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, tens of thousands of disarmed soldiers remained in Nanjing. They had brutally murdered Chinese people and destroyed the capital's construction. Letting them repair these destroyed buildings is not a harsh treatment, but a fair punishment. The Municipal Public Works Bureau planned to build roads outside and inside the city starting in November of last year. In terms of manpower, unarmed Japanese prisoners of war were used, and the municipal government provided financial resources, the Army Headquarters was responsible for materials, and the Public Works Bureau used its manpower, financial resources, and material strength to begin building roads around the city. That is, from Zhongyangmen to Yanziji, Yanziji to Yaohuamen, Yaohuamen to Taipingmen, and Yanziji to Baota Bridge in Xiaguan. Inside the city, the roads from the Army Headquarters to the Guanghuamen outside the airfield, as well as the US military parking lot attached to the Ming Palace airfield repair shop on Zhongshan Road, Hanzhong Road, and Mochou Road in the city center, totaling 40 kilometers, have all been completed. The Municipal Public Works Bureau specially invited the press to depart from the municipal government and go out of Taipingmen to view the completed road construction achievements.</p>
<p>Planting Small Grass to Prevent Collapse</p>
<p>The weather was gloomy, with a misty drizzle. The car proceeded in Dayeli. The speed of the car moved forward with a brisk tune in the gentle spring breeze.</p>
<p>The endless wheat fields, lined with clear streams and blue-gray cliffs, had more than a hundred Japanese prisoners working on them, wearing light yellow invading coats, carrying tools, and opening up a flat road for the victims. The car body was stable all the way, and the road surface paved with yellow sand and mud was only slightly inferior to asphalt in smoothness. Everyone was quite satisfied. When arriving at Yanziji, Dai Genfa, the director of the Japanese prisoner of war work office, explained that all the roads built by the Japanese prisoners were quite well-made, and the Japanese prisoners worked very hard. In order to prevent the collapse of the roadbed, small grasses were planted on the roadside. They obeyed the orders of our superiors.</p>
<p>Mayor Personally Supervises Road Repairs</p>
<p>After the visit to Yanziji was completed, we set off to visit the section in Xiaguan. The Twelve Caves along the mountain were scenic spots and scenic areas, and this road was even flatter. The north side of the road was the Yangtze River, the south side was high mountains and heavy rocks, and the road was close to the green pomegranate trees and cherry orchards. The wild fragrance was pungent, and there was no dust on the avenue. It should be a pleasure to enjoy the spring here.</p>
<p>After returning from Baota Bridge to Yanziji, Mayor Ma was met along the way and moved forward together. Mayor Ma pointed out where the roadbed should be modified and the drainage of the sewers.</p>
<p>Proceeding from Yanziji to Yaohuamen, a section of the road surface was paved with gravel. As far as the Xu Da Tomb in the area near Yaohuamen Station, this section of the road surface was very good, and the car speed reached 30 miles. The weather turned warmer, and the sunlight shone on the body, slightly warm. This section of the road was very long, and the road surface was five meters wide. All roads were filled with four-inch diameter stones, covered with crushed stone, and then added with sand and mud. It will never collapse due to rain. At twelve o'clock, we entered Taipingmen and went straight to Lizhi Society for a meal.</p>
<p>Huge Project, Considerable Achievements</p>
<p>At half past twelve, we departed from Lizhi Society and went straight to the airfield outside Guanghuamen. The road surface was paved with cement, which was particularly flat and comfortable. When we circled back, we went to the Ming Palace Airport Repair Shop to visit the construction of the US military parking lot. Hundreds of Japanese prisoners were stepping up their construction.</p>
<p>Director Dai explained in detail the efficiency of the work and the firmness after completion, and then took the car straight to the Public Works Office of Zhongshan Road for rest. By the time we arrived at the Public Works Office, only six reporters were left. Later, because of running around all day, I felt quite tired, and it was proposed to visit Hanzhong Road, Mochou Road, and the Qinhuai River section, but all were abandoned. Director Dai said of this huge project: the cost was 110 million, mobilizing 12,000 Japanese prisoners. In a few months, there have been many praises from all parties for this achievement, which can be gratifying. The construction of roads and sewers in the Army Headquarters is also underway and will be completed soon. (Contemporary Society)</p>

<p>Mother's Day Special Issue</p>
<h3>The Great Mother</h3>
<p>— Jiayin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Village, under the planning of social leaders and enthusiastic people, is gradually taking shape and is expected to be established soon.</p>
<p>The goal of the Children's Village is to help orphans without parents and young people who cannot adapt to society, so that they can grow up, have a skill, and become useful members of society. In other words, if the Children's Village is realized, it will become the mother of Shanghai's unfortunate children and young people, that is, the great mother of society.</p>
<p>On this first Mother's Day after the victory, in addition to redoubling our thoughts and gratitude for our own mothers and the hard work of all the good mothers in the world in raising their children, promoting the realization of the Shanghai Children's Village - the great mother of society - is indeed an extremely important and meaningful task.</p>
<p>The fundraising campaign for the Children's Village is about to begin. We hope that everyone will enthusiastically sponsor and participate in this meaningful campaign. Using helping this work to commemorate our mothers is the most appropriate thing to do.</p>
<h3>Reflections Inspired by Mother's Day</h3>
<p>— Mu Lei</p>
<p>Ellen Key said: "The greatest thing in the world is a mother. Motherly love shines upon the earth like warm sunshine." Indeed, motherly love is worthy of praise. If mothers did not share their love with their children, the very continuation of new cells within the nation's body might have long ceased.</p>
<p>If we believe that the twentieth century is the century of children, then we must acknowledge that mothers in the twentieth century bear extremely heavy responsibilities. Mothers must bear at least a large portion of the responsibility for the education of children. The growth and development of young seedlings and tender shoots rely entirely on a mother's nurturing.</p>
<p>I am not saying that fathers can ignore the education of children and unload all the responsibility onto the children's mother, but mothers have the most contact with their children, and the influence they exert on their children is also greater. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there are numerous famous people who have succeeded under the influence and guidance of a good mother's education.</p>
<p>In our country, the attitude of parents in educating their children can be summarized in the four characters "strict father, loving mother." Fathers are often strict, while mothers are often kind. Some say that under a strict-and-lenient education, children can achieve appropriate development in terms of knowledge, ability, and character. We often see in some families that when children break the rules or engage in bad behavior, the father always deals with them extremely severely. Scolding and reprimanding are not enough, and physical punishment is added. When the children reach the point of being unable to bear it, the mother comforts and forgives them in every possible way. The mother believes that her child has been punished and must be comforted. At this time, the child even uses blackmail to make many unreasonable demands, which the mother invariably refuses to reject. The child, who had just been beaten and scolded by the father until they cried, immediately smiles again under the mother's loving caress. This method of education, alternating between strictness and leniency, is commonly applied in general families.</p>
<p>Inconsistent attitudes of parents in educating their children can not only affect the healthy development of the child's psychology, but also cause various drawbacks and reduce the effectiveness of education. From the perspective of mental hygiene, parents should always maintain an appropriate and consistent attitude towards their children. Being too strict or too lenient is not good. Children have great plasticity and sensitivity. Negative suggestions can destroy their fragile minds and harm their mental health. A normal emotional life can only be cultivated in a normal environment. We do not believe that "strict father, loving mother" is an immutable principle. Strictness is necessary, but it should not be limited to the father's strictness; the mother also needs to be strict. Kindness is also necessary, but it should not be limited to the mother's kindness; the father also needs to be kind. Strictness and kindness are not two extremes; both parents must achieve "strict but kind" and "kind but strict." Strictness does not necessarily mean being completely severe and cold; strictness should be interpreted as being upright, fair, selfless, and authoritative. In educating children, parents should focus on setting an example and using authority and emotion to influence and guide them. Unrestrained indulgence is naturally also inappropriate; rewards and punishments must be balanced, and strictness and leniency must be applied appropriately. Parents should not teach their children to be afraid at first sight and avoid them; they should teach their children to have respect and trust upon seeing them. In the past, most parents in our country seemed to have neglected these points. Fathers often represented Yama, the king of hell, and children did not dare to get close to them, while mothers, because they were too lenient and prone to spoiling, became honey in the eyes of the children, but they did not necessarily respect them or listen to their advice. This has a very bad influence on the education of children.</p>
<p>Today is Mother's Day, and I would like to take this opportunity to advise all mothers to use your appropriate love to nurture the growth of your children, not to forgive them blindly, but to correct your children's bad habits and behaviors with a clear and fair attitude, and promote the development of their healthy bodies and minds. Do not cover up your children's shortcomings, and do not stand at the other extreme from the children's father by excessively pleasing your children. Remember to educate your children with the same attitude as the children's father.</p>

<h3>The Mother of Mother's Day – Anna Jarvis</h3>
<p>— Zi Fang</p>
<p>Anna Jarvis is now fifteen years old. She is very thin and blind. When Mother's Day comes, her room is filled with flowers. Doctors and nurses from the sanatorium come to see her. The Jarvis Committee sends people to read the many congratulatory letters she receives.</p>
<p>When Jarvis initiated the filial piety movement, she was still a beautiful and lively young woman. Unfortunately, she had a blind sister, Wen Xi Nuo. In order to take care of her poor sister, she rejected several men who proposed to her, sacrificing the happiness of her married life. Her mother was the daughter of a pastor from Grafton, West Virginia, who loved flowers, especially red chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>About fifty years ago, Anna's family moved to Philadelphia to live with Anna's brother, Kraut. A few years later, Kraut died, leaving behind about 700,000 yuan in property, which was to be shared by Anna and her sister. Unexpectedly, some of Kraut's creditors came to divide it up, and by last year, all the inheritance had vanished.</p>
<p>In May 1905, Anna's mother died. Having lost her brother and then her mother, she only had her blind sister to rely on. This caused her immense grief. On the second anniversary of her mother's death, she announced during a service at Grafton Church that she was preparing to launch a movement for the "forgotten" mothers of the world.</p>
<p>She said: "Mothers suffer more and enjoy less. When they are alive, their children are often ignorant, and by the time they want to be filial, they are gone."</p>
<p>So she wrote letters in Philadelphia to heads of state, governors, teachers, pastors, etc., urging:</p>
<p>"Every day is of course a day to honor our mothers, but in order to express sublime and persevering love, we should designate a special day."</p>
<p>Her letters immediately took effect, and celebrities such as Joseph Daniel, former President Theodore Roosevelt, and oil tycoon Rockefeller all responded with letters.</p>
<p>In 190W, the Presbyterian Church held a meeting in Seattle and stipulated that pastors in the church should bless mothers on the second Sunday of every May. Believers whose mothers were alive wrote letters to the elders to show their love and respect; those whose mothers had passed away wore white chrysanthemums to express their grief.</p>
<p>On May 7, 1914, the United States Senate unanimously passed Thomas Sifferlin's proposal to designate the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day. On May 9, President Wilson announced that Mother's Day was "a public expression of our filial piety to our mothers."</p>
<p>Forty-three countries have accepted the suggestion of Mother's Day. Anna was surprised and delighted to see that the movement she had initiated had achieved such great success. This movement has spread to every corner of the world, but inevitably some things have changed in nature.</p>
<p>"Mother's Day," she sighed to a reporter who interviewed her, "has been ruined by ignorant and greedy people. Telegraph offices have created ready-made clichés, and florists, candy stores, greeting card merchants, and even the barber next door are using my idea to attract customers and make money. A printed greeting card is meaningless; on the contrary, it shows your laziness, that you are too lazy to write a letter to your mother yourself, and your mother is better to you than anyone else in the world. Candy! You brought a box home for your mother to eat, but after a while, you ate it yourself. No matter what you do, give her what she lacks and needs! That was the original intention of my initiative for Mother's Day."</p>
<p>She hated all the advertising and profiteering that used Mother's Day as a business opportunity. She was once taken to the officer corps for disrupting order for opposing the sale of flowers in the meeting place. In 1934, she went to Washington to condemn James Wallace for issuing Mother's Day commemorative stamps.</p>
<p>Anna is truly lonely and isolated, almost cut off from the world. However, she has quite a few trustees. She arranged for a clipping service to specifically cut and send news about her from newspapers and magazines. In this way, her files became so numerous that she had to buy the house next door to store them.</p>
<p>On a bitterly cold day in November 1942, Anna staggered into a Philadelphia hospital for treatment, emaciated, blind, impoverished, and ending her days in desolation.</p>
<p>Poor Anna only received good care in her declining years. She no longer quarreled with florists and candy merchants, and they were also donating to the Anna Jarvis Foundation. After her death, the people will ask the government to jointly build a permanent building to commemorate this person who sacrificed her intelligence, spirit, and happiness for Mother's Day.</p>
<h3>Mother's Day Reflections</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>Today is another annual Mother's Day.</p>
<p>Those who know it's Mother's Day and have the opportunity or need to participate in the celebration, as usual, celebrate: speeches, parades, posting slogans, those with mothers wear red flowers, those without mothers wear white flowers.</p>
<p>When I see a group of people celebrating Mother's Day, I think of a group of people celebrating their own mothers' birthdays or their mothers' birthdays.</p>
<p>Ordinary families always prepare food and wine, and wealthy families invite more guests, or issue a slight essay, advocating and harmonizing a few poems for their mothers' birthdays. No matter what the situation of the mother is normally, she is celebrated happily by everyone at least on this day.</p>
<p>When I see people celebrating their mothers' birthdays, I remember a saying of Confucius.</p>
<p>Confucius once said: "The age of one's parents must be known: on the one hand, it brings joy; on the other hand, it brings fear."</p>
<p>I dare not speculate whether Confucius' words were spoken for a group of people celebrating their parents' birthdays, but every time I see people celebrating their mothers' birthdays, I think of these words.</p>
<p>In the congratulatory messages for mothers' birthdays, have we ever seen anything more full of deep affection, have we ever seen anything more revealing of filial piety?</p>
<p>How many people, on their mother's birthday, will think of their mother's age and increase their filial piety? Similarly, how many people are willing to take a look at the situation of the modern mothers of our country on Mother's Day and think a little about the true meaning of Mother's Day?</p>
<p>On Mother's Day, please take a quiet look at your mother's kind face, look at the layers of wrinkles on her forehead, recording her hard work and bitter experiences; the silver-like white hair on the top of her head, filled with desolate and vicissitudes of memories: the grievances of the daughters-in-law who are not harmonious, the disputes between the sisters-in-law, the conflicts between wives and concubines, and the contradictions with the thoughts of the children, some have gradually become past historical relics, and some are still being repeated in our generation, adding many new troubles and hardships.</p>
<p>When celebrating a mother's birthday, one should think of her age and increase one's filial piety; on this day of celebrating Mother's Day, should we not look around at the circumstances of the mothers of our country and redouble our efforts and vigilance?</p>
<p>How should we work hard to improve the situation of the mothers in general, so that we can be worthy of our own mothers? How should we improve the situation of the mothers in general, so that we can better fulfill our responsibilities to our children?</p>
<p>We must be filial to our mothers, and mothers must fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Every year when celebrating Mother's Day, how much comfort has been gained on the filial piety side? How much achievement has been gained on the responsibility side?</p>
<p>Celebrating Mother's Day is a happy thing, but it is best to add some vigilance. Celebrating Mother's Day with the feeling of "on the one hand, it brings joy; on the other hand, it brings fear" may make Mother's Day more meaningful.</p>
