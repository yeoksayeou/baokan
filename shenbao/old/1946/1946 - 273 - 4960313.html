<h3>朱德抵張垣策劃防守　察省成軍事重心　由豫北上國軍收復磁縣</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕華北軍事局面，以察哈爾爲重心，呈現山雨欲來風滿樓狀態，平行轅主任李宗仁亦不　言，察省局勢，於最近即可開朗。但綜觀冀·熱。綏·晋·豫各省，尙未出積極準備與牽制階段。孫連仲昨吿記者，國軍將打通平漢·津浦兩路，反未提及平綏。平行營參謀畏王鴻韶，昨亦否認冀熱國軍已對察開始行動，對於近日報紙紛歧消息，似頗感困惑。「觀察家」發言亦多不一致，未來戰局之重心，究在察東察西抑在察北，各有其說。察東察西除共軍自動放棄三二無險可守地點外，不能證實國軍有正式進攻。熱河國軍實力頗强，似近事實，越圍塲迫多倫說，絕不確，但多倫終將爲必爭之地，因得該地旣可控制熱北，且切斷東北共軍之主要聯絡綫。現熱省自赤峯直綫向南西半部軍事，已劃歸十一戰區外，其另半部，仍歸東北長官部。綏東軍事吿一段落後，所謂傅作義部已長驅人察，亦不能證實，個中人謂集寗之役後，尙需短時之整備。冀省則除冀察邊境布置緊張外，冀中冀南近日之兩軍行動，似均在牽制察省，保定周圍國軍向外漸圖發展，共軍則積極威脅平漢北段，數月未聞之炸車事件，昨復發生於東長壽附近。冀東共軍失利後，則葉中主力在平古綫，作牽制冀察邊境行動。由豫北安陽北上之國軍，已收復磁縣，威脅劉伯誠根據地之邯戰，順德，牽制冀南劉部北調。晋省共軍則全面發動反攻，以掩晋北之空虛。閻長官日前在紀念週曾謂，綏東之軍事勝利，尙未能解除山西之危急。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕國軍何以遲遲進軍張家口，已成此間新聞界咸欲揭破之謎，一部份敏感之觀察家，認爲史達林發表談話後，國際局勢已較和緩，故蔣主席爲適應此種情勢，乃提前返京，重商和平解決之門，是以進軍張家口之舉，遂吿延緩。北平行營參謀長王鴻韶，昨晚於歡迎美軍眷屬鷄尾酒會中，亦曾吿記者，謂華北之軍事計劃與行動，南京方面可隨時根據政治情勢指令改變，並明白官稱：和平談判，隨時可影響軍事行動。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿九日電〕冀南醞釀大戰聲中，國軍已逼近邯鄲，共軍有力部隊現配備於邯鄲外圍永年，成安，沙河，南和，平鄕，鷄澤等縣，劇戰即將展開。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕戰鼓鼕鼕聲中，週末輕鬆渡過，昨晚李宗仁·孫連仲等軍事高級首長，皆出席懷仁堂之鷄尾酒會，並看小翠花之「拾玉鐲」，張君秋之「汾河灣」，長官部方面亦有音樂會，頗似昇平景象，今日平市雖秋空一碧萬里，但鐵鳥至疏，長官部亦呈半休假狀態。官方迄未證實進駐康莊之說。冀東方面建昌營，仍爲共軍所據，無何新變化，綏東·晋北方面大戰甫過，亟待休整，並無即將前進模樣。此間所傳進駐商都·尙義者，當係地方游擊部隊，某方頗傳十六軍將空運綏東參加十二戰區作戰，惟此說並未能證實·華北目前之平　，究爲和平之開端。仰爲暴風雨前夕之狀態，尙待事實證明。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕防守大同之某軍事關係者，昨晚飛抵平，據稱傅作義部解大同圍後，已配合大同守軍·一部繼續東進，迫近察西重鎭陽高。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕「東北爲東亞寶庫，蘊藏著無限資源，所有工廠，幾佔全國總額百分之八十，雖經打劫破壞，對原有設備，具有規模者不少，具有永吉之小豐滿，及鴨綠江之水電廠，原動力可供農工事業之發展，此外，工資低工潮少，更可爲全國企業家之策源地，若傾全國人力物力，掃除地方性過去觀念，加緊開發，恢復工廠，則生事業之前途，國際貿易之展望，當不可限量，如此貨暢其流，法幣回籠，可以制止通貨膨脹。」此爲新由瀋陽蒞滬中央銀行東北特派員王文蔚答復中央社記者詢問東北經濟近況之開頭語。</p>
<p>金融</p>
<p>王氏對中央銀行敷設金融網概況，則稱中央銀行已次在瀋陽，長春，四平，錦州，山海關，吉林六地成立分行，營口，承德兩地亦在籌備中，現值關內外商運已通，工商滙款應即開放，至於滙率，據中央銀行發表，對津者滙出爲一比十一元五角，滙進爲一比十二元五角，按照中央銀行掛牌，隨時加以調整，對於紅軍票，在收復區以內，百元者已收兌廿億元，小票則亦祇收不放，流通劵之發行，用意在不願使人民所有資金（指偽滿）頓遭貶值，規定一比一計算，待各地收復後，照關內各種物價，按照法幣價值，再尋求另一價格，然後收回之，困難重重，暫依照當時關內物價指數作一比十三之數，原定應隨指數昇降，而予調整，但當局顧念軍警及公務員待遇起見，保留未動。</p>
<p>金價</p>
<p>王氏未對記者詢及東北金價問題，則稱：當地價格漲落，以平津爲標準，當本人離瀋前夕，金價每兩爲三十萬元左右，驟聽之，價格較關內相差甚鉅，實際該地度覺衡，尚未臻統一制度，依然沿用八錢六分餘比一萬例，在東北各地，金店爲新興事業之一，但事先須經委會核准，方得營業，在偽滿時代，黃金國有，婦女飾，亦在禁例，現在金店營業，以裝飾品爲對象，其黃金成份，不採取九九扣九八扣制度，而以名銀樓戳記成色高低云。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>費正清論文的錯覺</h3>
<p>美國駐華大使館新聞處前任處長費正清氏，最近在大西洋雜誌上發表「美國在華的機會」一文，檢討美國對華政策，頗多隔靴搔癢之談，不可以不辦。費氏在華期間，他所主持的機構內，羅致了許多共黨和左傾人士，他的意見或因此而有所偏，這是很可惜的。</p>
<p>以中美邦交而論，我們這兩個民族，向來維持著友好的關係，美國化了少的金錢，在中國推行宗教，醫業，衛生，暨教育等事業；呂國也化了不少的金錢，派了許多學生遠渡重洋，赴美國學習，現在社會的任何一層，都有受過美式教育的份子，而且佔著極重要的地位。誠如費正清氏所說，「我們所知道的現在中國，是一大羣利用我們的（指美國的）經驗的人士們所建設起來的。」尤其在抗戰期間，中美關係更加密切，文化的交流，更加通暢，則論理，在中美之間，當不復有隔間與聽見了。但是不幸得很，費氏論文中含有不少誤解中國的論斷。我們并非頑固到不願傾聽一句中肯的評語，但外國人評論中國內政，如果先入爲主，強我從同，終難免有隔靴搔癢之感。我們一方面固應歡迎費氏的真方忠告，另一方面卻不願讓一部分自爲「中國通」而實「不通」的模糊影響之談，在中美之間，再引起更深的隔膜，故不得不說出我們的看法，以正中美人民的視聽。</p>
<p>第一，費正清氏以政協決議未能實行的責任，完全加在國民黨右派身上。這一種見解，顯欠公允。我們無須絕對否認國民黨這樣一個大黨，其內部意見容有出入，正如民主黨之在美國，對于政府的外交政策也有辦論一般，不足爲奇，然而國民黨的政策是取決於代表大會或中央全會的，一經決議，無論或左或右，全都服從，而不能偏責所謂右派的。何況這些左右之分，就是共黨企圖分化國民黨的說法，費氏無意中受了欺騙麻醉。在事實上，政協決議所以未能完全付諸實行，最重要的關鍵，乃在中共迷信武力萬能，首先破壞整編方案，在東北成立其所謂「民主聯軍」，阻止國軍開入東北恢復主權，同時蘇聯又將東北的工業設備，搬運一空，激起全國人民愛國護權的怒潮，這種運動，完全出於愛國人民的自動，絕非國民黨右派份子所能煽動起來的。把這種自然的愛國運動，和現在的共黨鼓煽的反美運動，比較一下，沒有偏見的美國朋友應該可以明白那一種是真正的民意。且事實可以證明，國民黨對於全國各黨派共同商定的協議，不特不欲破壞，抑至今猶希望其實現。蔣主席迭次發表演說，莫不以實行政協決議爲言，且催促中共和其它黨派推選國大代表與國府委員，已非一次，而下令停戰更歷幾次三番，是可見政府「政治民主化」，固早向著目標邁進，即對于「軍隊國家化」亦已著手實行縮編軍隊，而中共則既不肯依照方案統編其部隊，又不肯參加國大，參加國府，則阻礙政協決議之實行，責任誰屬，顯而易見。</p>
<p>第二，費氏以資本主義的眼光，觀察中國人民，認爲中國人民所迫切需要的，只是經濟的民主，而不是政治的民主。他說：「一個人祇有在吃飽了肚子以後，才想到言論的自由。」他又說：「我們發現他們（中共）是保障農民經濟福利的最有效的倡導者，爲了他們能幫助農民獲得他們在經濟上的需要，所以他們能獲得農民們在政治上的支撐。」這一段話，我們完全不能同意。因爲我們相信政治的民主（民權主義）與經濟的民主（民生主義），是一體之兩面而不可分的。在此兩種民主以外，尚有民族的民主（即民族主義），亦爲萬不可忽的要義。我們之所以抗戰八年，堅忍不屈，就爲了有這種精神。國父孫中山先生首創三民主義，對于此三種民主，同時並重，一以贯之，其理由也就在此。同時，中共的「政治資本」，是否真能爲農民謀福利？也可證之于顯明的事實。按之蘇北共軍佔領區的實際情形，中共只知破壞，不知建設，已把整個的蘇北殺光燒光，使一般農民甯願淪爲可憐無告的難民，流落他鄉，而不願留在故鄉做中共的組上肉。任其宰割。京滬一帶擁擠著數百萬的蘇北難民，就是一個不可否認的鐵證。以言延安的政治，從前關起門作戲劇式的導演，容或可欺騙若千外人，但久而久之，其絕無民主可言，已爲眾所周知。美國女記者島脫萊女士最近投函紐約泰晤士報，也說延安絕無民主氣象。不知費正清氏雙怎樣可以替中共辦護？</p>
<p>第三，費氏指蔣執政後的國民黨變成了保守黨。他所根據的理由有三：　在政府中佔據著重要位置的，始終是那幾個人物；　并無改善農民生活的計劃；　政府與大地主及金融操縱者連成一氣，都恐懼革命。這些話，真所謂「言偽而辦」，似是而非。時至今日，國民黨已成爲廣大的綜合體，三民主義已成爲通國的口頭禪，國民黨中間或不免有一小部份的落伍者，但少數落伍，何黨可免？否則蘇聯何必清黨？故從大處著眼，國民黨仍是一個前進的革命政黨，不僅有適合國情的三民主義，爲全國人民所一致信奉，而且有光榮的歷史，領導抗戰更有著輝煌的功績，只要沒有外力的阻撓，讓它主持國政，在安定中求進步，則逐步實行三民主義，改善一般人民的生活，是絕無問題的。而且一般開明的黨員，早已發起黨政革新運動，不顧目前環境如何困難，仍在排除萬難，日與民眾接近。各地民意機關的成立，對政府概作嚴正的批評，而中樞當局也正在計劃農村土地改革的實施方案，和大規模推廣合作社制度，凡此都顯示著國民黨時時在向進步的方向走。不過國民黨所要求的進步，是要在安定社會秩序中去求得。而共產黨卻不顧一切，破壞了秩序再說。試問我們要那種好？費氏所謂「保守」，不知究係何所指。若謂在安定中求進步就算保守，則試問費氏，今日的美國杜魯門政府，貢國的工黨政府，是否亦可謂保守政府？又是否必須學了蘇聯一九一七年的大革命才算進步政府？</p>
<p>最後，我們還要聲時一點：費正清氏在言論自由的美國，對於美國對華政策，任意發表政見，原屬司空見慣，不足重視，但是費氏在華時日并不過少，且負有溝通中美人民意見的責任，而今發表這種「顯失公允」的言論，我們不能不引爲遺憾。我們聯想到華萊士在副總統任內曾來華遊歷，回國以後，報告其觀感，意謂當時重慶的國民政府，不久則將經濟崩潰，甚至政治也垮台。這種觀察，竟合羅斯福總統一時感到迷惘。由今思之，走馬看花固然是未窺真相，隔靴掻癢也難免不切實際。我們對于美國左派人士評論中國政治，終覺得有一個共同的缺陷，就是偏見太深，硬要以自己的尺度，衡量其他國家的政治。較之法學權龐德的觀察，不可同日而語了。須知各國政治的發展與演進，都有它一定的軌跡，而傳統的社會環境，更是一個見有決定性的因素。外人評論，如果不能正視現實，而一味基於自己業已形成的意識形態，則其所見，就不免要引起錯覺了。費氏一個人錯覺，可以不去管他；可是不能讓他引起中美間的隔膜。</p>

<h3>土國決心維護主權　拒蘇共管海峽要求立場不變</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿八日電〕關於土耳其海峽問題，蘇聯業於本月廿四日再度照會土耳其政府，堅持韃靼尼爾海峽有由蘇土兩國共同防衛之必要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社伊斯丹埠廿八日電〕今日據極可靠方面消息，「非常事變或將發作」，土耳其軍隊已劍及　及準備應付。此種觀察係莫斯科電台廣　蘇聯重新　求韃靼尼　海峽應由黑海各國訂立條約共同保衛而起。土耳其政府方面日來因之甚爲悲觀，大有山雨欲來風滿樓之槪，惟土耳其已準備應付萬一，露骨言之，土耳其已決心維護其主權，如　被攻，則五分鐘內即可開始戰鬥。據莫斯科電台廣播稱，蘇聯已於九月廿四日主耳其　出一次照會，堅持修改　特　條約，共管韃靼尼爾海峽，並警吿土耳其不得與非黑海國勾結採取軍事行動。此項二次要求，外間絕未得悉，待莫斯科電台廣播後，始知有此事，土耳其官方對此尙未有何正式表示。</p>

<h3>蘇要求魯爾國際化　指責英美違反波茨坦協定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿九日電〕莫斯科電合本口廣播文吿，指責英美違反波茨坦協定。略謂，蘇聯對德政策之根本目標，在使德國民主化，並解除德國武裝，以防止德國任何新侵略。關於此層，必須確保波茨坦協定是否在德國各佔領區實施，蘇聯所以要求將魯爾工業區（現爲英軍佔領區）置於國際管制之下，共故在此。因魯爾區工業爲德軍國主義之基礎此項原則並未爲其他佔領國所接受，故蘇聯若不予以實施，亦不能獨任其咎。蘇佔領區內一切軍事組織均已解散，一切納粹與法西斯份子均已逐出行政機構亦無任何工廠可能用於軍事目標。反之，其他佔領區則不能照此辦理，誠爲不幸。英美企圖設立「西方集團」或「歐洲合衆國」，志在推翻波茨坦協定，此項協定乃爲和平之必要保證，豈容推翻云。</p>

<h3>一九一九，一九四六年　兩次巴黎和會比較（下）</h3>
<p>— 祿煜</p>
<p>（五）人物之不同</p>
<p>在兩次巴黎和會人物之比較的一點上，下列三事，値得重視。第一，關於各巨頭本身之魄力與手腕，第二，關於各巨頭間之合作關係，第三，關於美國代表團之人選。一九一九年巴黎和會席上最重要之人物，厥爲衆所皆知之「三巨頭」——美之威爾遜總統，英之勞合喬治首相與法之克雷　梭。此三人，無論就國外威望，國內地作或事業成就上言，可謂係第一次大戰時代之第一流政治家，尤其是威總統之理想主義，喬治首相之外交技巧，及老虎總理之愛國熱誠，最爲人所稱道不置。反顧出席此次和會之各强國代表，如美之貝爾納斯國務卿，英之貝文外相，蘇之莫洛托夫外長及法之皮杜爾總統，在對聲望或對內職位上，究遠不及上屆和會之「三巨頭」。此一事實使今日之和會减色不少。筆者執筆至此，不禁興人物寥落之感，而痛惜於故總統羅斯福之早逝與前首相邱吉爾之落選也。至於各巨頭間之合作關係，則本屆和會亦遠不及上次和會之融洽。此中原因，上面已約略述及，簡言之：不外一則由於目前東西兩集團間關係之緊張，其嚴重程度遠在上决和會中美·法之對立。二則由於今日國際舞台上無一領袖具有崇高之　譽，如一九一九年之威爾遜總統者。貝爾納斯·貝文與莫洛托夫，就地位·聲望·事業而言，均係半斤對八兩，誰也不致對雄讓步。三則由於英之貝文與蘇之莫洛托夫，均係國際間著名的脾氣燥，火氣大之人物，兩人爭辯，易成面紅耳赤之態。此對於議事之順利進行，實於不良影饗。至於本屆和會美國代表團之人選，所以値得重視，其理由有如下述：按上次威總統失敗之原因，乃由於渠赴巴黎之際，所帶隨員中並無共和黨要員在內，因此，該時之美國代表團，祗代表民主黨，而非代表整個美國，及威總統自海外歸來後，凡爾賽和約不爲共和黨佔優勢之參議院所接受，於是威總統賚志以歿，而美國亦未能加入國聯。此次杜魯門總統爲避免重蹈上你次覆　，除派國務　　爾　斯州　首席代表外，又派民主　要員參院外交委員會主席康納利與共和黨要員參議員范登堡爲代表，一起參加和會。如是則本屆和會之美國代表團，實乃代表美國之　個國家，並非僅代表執政之民主黨。此　對日後美國參院之批准和約，極有關係。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜上所述，對兩次巴黎和會之比較，可獲得下列幾個結論：第一，作爲和會背景之國際情勢，一九四六年遠較一九一九年爲緊張與嚴重。第二，就會議之任務，範圍與職權而言，本屆和會受有嚴格之限制。第三，在會議之組織機構之一點上，本屆和會遠較上屆爲簡單。第四，至於談到參加會議之人物，則今日和會之代表遠不及廿六年前之「三巨頭」。由於上述，讀者或將獲得一印象，以爲此次和會之前途，實充滿黑晴，決無成功希望。吾人果應抱如此悲觀之態度乎？曰，不然。雖各種現象指出，本屇和會之「地利」「人和」均不及上屆，但有一關於「天時」的重要事實，我人切不可忽略。此即今日之世界已進入原子時代。第三次大戰萬一爆發，其結果將非誰勝誰敗，而是同歸於盡。今日集　於巴黎和會之各國負責當局，應抱「只許成功，不許失敗」之宗旨，相忍相讓，以促和約之完成與和平之建立。蓋此不　有關別國人民之福利，亦即爲本國同胞以及自己子孫之生存打算也。此筆者於比較兩次和會之不同點後，所欲大聲疾呼爲和會各代表吿者也。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕記者昨訪代表楊撫生，據談：此次赴京請願，表示本市工商界之期望，效果固不可必，但總希望政府當軸，一改以往錯誤之見解，不再視本市爲利蔽，以搜括爲能事。要知本市工商業，無論已往目前將來，無可吾認爲全國經濟重心，彷彿奇花異葩，苟能盡量助長發展，則鮮艷佳果，定能播其優良種子于全國，於是整個國家經濟，得以穏定，故中央應以園丁自任，一反以往取之用之之態度。袪除苛雜，整肅官方，除蟲之工作也。放寬資金，調整關稅，施肥灌漑也。政府茍不爲國家民族着想，一仍舊貫，官僚與人民爭利，中央與地方爭利，且旦而伐，不特本市經濟沒落，可計日而待，即全國建設，亦毫無指望。吾知當局未必知此不智，則此行之結果，定能一變當局之觀念，爲本市爲國家，顧全民意，不再敷衍了事，同時希望興論界一致支援，俾代表團不虛此行。</p>

<h3>市參議員天上遊　從飛機裏俯瞰下界　高度蒙蔽了罪惡紊亂</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕回想我國航空界黯淡的過去，不得不呌人覺得近年來中國在航空方面的進步，稱得上一聲「突飛猛進」。這自然是比較籠統的說法，要是和歐洲文明國家相比，那相差太遠了。在美國，在蘇聯，在英國……所謂招待新聞界空中飛行，早已成爲歷史上的陳跡。但是在中國，到今天爲止，它究竟還保持着幾分吸引人的力量。</p>
<p>昨天淸晨九時，山國航空公司在龍華機塲招待本市參議員作空中遊覽。前往參加的人，出乎意外的擁擠。總計參議員的一百餘人，參議會職員的六十餘人，航建會會員及來賓的一百人。該公司撥C47運輸機兩架，分數批飛行。由機航組主任陳鴻恩親自駕駛。</p>
<p>記者自平晨八時牛起候，一直站到十一時半，才挨到了末一次飛行。昨天天氣特別好，飛機中的溫度也很正常，沒有坐過飛機，平時常聽見人家說飛機巾怎麼冷，但是昨天在空中盤旋一刻鐘，却始終沒有覺得有絲毫寒意。這恐怕是因爲飛得特別低的緣故。我們的飛機自龍華機塲向南起飛，橫過黃浦江，向東折　過浦東，而到吳淞口，崇明島，然後再由北轉回機塲。在高空中看上海，是再美麗不過的！一切罪惡，混濁，和紊亂，都給蒙蔽了。連平日交通最雜亂的南京路，都覺得是可愛的。飛機越過跑馬　，國際飯店頂上「禮義廉恥」四個大字，明顯地映人眼簾。但是，十五分鐘以後，當我再回到這罪惡的淵　時，便覺得還該是最銳利的諷刺了。</p>
<p>「天空遊覽」在今日，仍然能給我們一種新奇的感覺，雖然二十年來。我們畢竟也有了很多飛機塲，班機，和自己的飛機師。然而，這還是不够的。當美國已將完成八發動機超重超高空巨型機的今日，我們應如何警覺自己的落後，而急起直追呢！</p>

<p>〔又訊〕蘇州少女范珍琴，年華二九，家住虹口北江西路天潼路順和里七十號。昨日上午七時卅分、因細故爲母陸氏所責，氣憤之餘，頓萌厭世之念，竟背人吞服來沙　自盡。後經家人發覺，召車飛送醫院救治，因服毒過深，抵院後即吿氣絕身死。現屍體車送騐屍所檢騐候核中。</p>
<h3>洞房花燭夜　強盜送死來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前晚通北路德安里十五號張祥生家，正値其弟祥甫結婚，賀客盈門，迄至深晚鬧房者尙未散去。突來盜匪五名，各執槍械，蜂擁人內，迫令新郞新娘及賀客將所有財物交出。正洗刧時，賀客中有胆大者數人，乘機將二盜抱住，其時任望風之一盜即出槍轟擊，一彈誤中同黨左胸，立即應聲倒地，而被擒之盜卒被兎脫。惟盜等至此亦驚惶失色，即呼嘯奪門岡逃。適有警備部水上稽査所巡邏員警路過，聞警奮勇上前，將該二盜擒獲，奪下六吋手槍一枝，膛內尙留有廿彈五粒，又木壳一枝，子彈五粒。餘盜　機逃逸。所獲各盜，經帶所鞫問，據供一名張錦法，天津人，二十九歲，住大逆灣路昆明路同興里廿六號，一名劉炎，湖北人，三十六歲。受傷之盜名彭輝，旋經送警察醫院，因傷中要害，抵院後即斃命。在逃匪犯正繼續偵緝中。</p>

<h3>上海的抵兒所　青年會歷史悠久　保健院後起之秀　「奶少兒多」尚待普遍設立</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「男女平等」的口號，不知道已經喊了多少年，然而男女究竟平等了沒有？不必爭辯，只要順手把最時髦的參議員來舉一個例，總數一百七十八個堂堂參議員之中，女性祇佔五個，用比例來算一下，是三十五與一之比，這衹是一個眼前的例子，事實上像這種事實，在這個國家裏，正多不勝計，正因爲過多了，所以誰都不以爲奇。不是嗎？你幾時會聽見過有人問！「爲什麼代表民意的參議員，在三十五個之中才有一個是女的呢」？</p>
<p>與其駡一聲「女人最不想上進」，還不如說「道個社會不讓女子有上進的機會」，來得切實和中肯。拋開現社會對於女性的歧視和排擠不談，由於公共事業的不發達，而使女子的「結婚和事業」形成了晨尖銳的矛盾。——婚姻就成爲女子終身的囹圄。然而人究竟不能違反自然，結婚原是人生大事之一。而因難也就隨着來了，油，鹽，　，醋事小，扶養兒女事大，把白白胖胖的孩子交給目不識丁的老媽子，總覺不能放心。於是偉大的母愛，呌一個做母親的，犧性了一切，一心一意扶養孩子，什麽天才和特長，還不是統統埋沒在小圈子的生活中了。</p>
<p>所以，在「托兒所」沒有普遍發達的今日，女子是沒有前途的，「男女平等」也永遠只是一個美麗的夢！</p>
<p>提起上海的托兒所，眞是鳳毛麟角，少得可憐，其中歷史最悠久的恐怕要算女靑年會所主辦的，聽說成績還不差，只是範園太小，受惠者不多。此外，上海市幼兒保健院，爲了適應這個需要，也已舉辦托兒所，暫以收容三足月至二足歲的嬰兒爲限，目前寄養的嬰兒中，以公務員及工商界人士佔多數。由醫師護士等專門人才善爲看顧。第一院址在北四川路一七三弄十號，第二院址在北海寗路二四弄七號。目前該院所最感覺困難的，是院舍和經費問題，因爲假若沒有寬大的院舍，和充足的經費，是難以達到理想的。</p>
<p>「舉辦托兒所」的呼聲，雖然喊得震天價響，但是兌現了多少？報載本市婦女界已向參議會提出，請撥一部分經費舉辦托兒所，參議會亦已通過在九億元社會救濟經費中撥出一部作爲專款，但願這張支票能够早日兌現，「托兒所」能够普遍設立，這才是全體婦女的福音，也是國家的幸運。反之，「托兒所」不能發達，婦女就永無翻身之日，再說重一句——中國就永無富强之日。因爲誰都不能否認，作爲總人口半數的二萬萬女性的力量，是建國過程中所不能缺少的！</p>

<h3>表演盡善盡美　橫掃海上羣雄　羣聲昨大敗華聯　六六比四五華聯一籌莫展　體育館球迷近萬盛況空前</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕羣聲籃球隊橫掃海上羣雄竟然毫無敵手，本市冠軍華聯隊，昨晚劇戰結果，在一面倒形勢下亦遭慘敗，比數六十六比四十五，上半時客軍以卅三比廿三佔先十分，羣聲表演盡善盡美，華聯隊竟一籌莫展。</p>
<p>空前盛況</p>
<p>近萬球迷昨晚大鬧體育館，上午十時預售門票，一刻鐘內，一轟而光，下午五時，球迷已紛紛而來，六時半體育館已吿客滿，被擯門外者數千人，大門卒被搗毁，警局出動　車，開放自來水，始未發生事故，館內座椅大批被毁，秩序混亂已極，宣鐵吾司令入塲參觀，亦經想盡方法。盛况遠勝全運決賽，眞所謂空前也。上海電台昨晚廣播戰情，至九時始畢。</p>
<p>僡打愈妙</p>
<p>羣聲愈打愈妙，昨晚勝來之易，出乎意外，華聯略現慌亂，採用五人聯防，於是既無法進攻，退守則處處漏洞，速度，投籃，體力，俱相形見絀，欲不敗難矣。昨晚除吳成章外，餘皆遠較平時遜色，李震巾於下半時四十四比卅三時，五次犯規被罰出後，張良雄入替，仍無發展，全軍遂吿瓦解。</p>
<p>無法招架</p>
<p>裁判劉荷生，瞿鴻律，鳴笛開賽羣聲者爲陳金德，陳金置，蔡文華，蔡文章，楊人輝，華聯爲孔廣益，李震中，包松圓，吳成章，陳學祟，比賽時間採上下半時，此爲羣聲在滬之首度改變。華聯吳成章先破籃圈，蔡文華回敬，楊人輝犯規，學崇罰中，華聯三對二領前，迨三比一後，羣聲即一路前導，成七對四，十比六，華聯叫停，但仍難殺其威，羣聲金德金置昆仲，連連建功，廿九對十八，相差達十一分，上半時完畢，卅三對廿三，客軍佔先。再戰聲中，雙方人馬，並無調動，蔡文華籃下竄入，首先建功，華聯仍無起色，分數相差每在十分左右，震中五次犯規被黜，張良雄入代，此數爲四十二對三十一，良雄上場，遠擲雞功，但金德文章連速妙射，獲分累累，五十四對三十七，比數益遠，金德破籃，成六十三對三十九，已成縣殊局面，鐘聲鳴時，六十六對四十五。</p>

<p>又王部長已於昨晚十時，乘晚車返京。</p>
<h3>二十一家工廠　估價問題　尚未圓滿解決</h3>
<p>經濟部爲優惠後方工業家撥出二十一家敵僞工廠，優先承購之估値問題，後方工業家仍未滿意，評價委員會之估値標準，係按照美國新貨打四折至八折計算，但承購者認爲此種工業機械設備，僅及美貨一折至三折，故建議處理局中信局及經濟部召開一聯席會議，商討估値問題及統一各主管機關之工作二點，但處理局方面，認爲不必多此一舉，因此聯席會議一事，經多决奔走接洽後，乃吿流產，現各後方工業家，經數度商討後，決定四項步驟，（一）後方工業界對其處理之工廠，自行根據實際統計村料，加以估定一單位，俾討論後，呈處理局，（二）因此項工廠目的爲優惠於抗戰有功之各後方工業家，儘可提取其中二，三廠公開標售，以視處理局所定價格，是否能有受卞，與最高標價爲若干，與評價相差幾成，以示優惠之實，（三）必要時將至南京向經濟部王部長陳述前後經過情况，請示辦法，並要求仍召集聯席會議，從長計　各項　議，（四）如各項建議皆不　採納，最後祇能放棄此種優惠權利云。</p>

<h3>箔業存貨登記　一個有內舊罄存貨　逾期即須補納捐稅</h3>
<p>上海箔業公會召開成立大會，據主席報吿，接奉貨物稅局通知，箔業須辦存貨登記，並限一個月內將以前存貨售罄，逾期即須補捐納稅，現公會方面已聲請緩徵免補，結果如何，尙難預測，惟商人對執貨，已不若以前樂觀，咸有戒心，故行市亦微降。</p>
<h3>麥爾登呢飛漲</h3>
<p>美國麥爾登呢，一週之內，由二萬二千元突漲至三萬七八千元，究其主要原因，大部份爲內外行手貨相繼售罄，本客帮實銷暢旺，而進口報關之貨，海關誤會爲剩餘物資，延緩證明亦爲其一因，據一般觀察，本月底或下月初海關交涉完成，可以出貨，則市價或將回縮云。</p>
<h3>新增貨物稅　明日起開征</h3>
<p>上海貨物稅局遵照財政部頒布新課茶葉，麥粉，呢絨，化粧等數種貨物稅，近有毛紡，化粧業等表示反對，正電呈中央請示、茲悉該局對於上項新課稅，決定於明日起實行開征，在未奉財部明令前，所征稅率，亦照章辦理</p>
<h3>來貨可望不可及　人造絲問題嚴重</h3>
<p>上週人造絲價，瘋狂上升，其最大原因有二，自紡建停止配售絲號後，市上存底日枯，雖有外貨到埠之傳說，而音信杳然，一般貨主，視爲奇貨，此其一，紡建配給各廠商之掛牌價，比上期增加百分之七十，且數量更减少至每廠十五包，一般廠商因所配得之數與銷耗量相較，不敷甚巨，除向黑市搜購外，餘無他法，此其二，有此二大原因，更遭投機者操縱　斷，以致造成黑市之一帆風順，勢不可遏，週初一二〇天橋有光在三百二三十萬元之間，嗣後逐日高抬，甚至一日間有漲起七十萬元者，迄週末竟做至五百卅萬元，一週內高漲二百餘萬元，如此瘋在直上，一般小型綢廠，迫得出於停頓。如果來源無新途徑，綢織業將大受打擊。</p>
<h3>紙業困難重重　紙廠遭外貨打擊　行號困於墊本開支太大　淘汰號家已佔半數左右</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報記者昨日分訪若干紙業領袖及社團，獲悉該業近况，仍未見改善。一般紙商，均有交易難做之感。外滙調整後，紙市雖曾一度刺激而振作，終以市面實銷，究屬有限，不易持久，再言向外定貨，往往需預付定銀半數。設各貨能準期迅速到達，則紙商尙有利潤可圖。吾則，長期拖延，（此事據悉已屬屢見不鮮），加以高利負担，非惟無利可圓，甚至尙須虧本。據悉：外貨紙品中，現以透明紙及玻璃紙利潤較佳。白報紙及道林紙，利潤極薄。至本街產品，如灰報紙等，過去銷路，以北帮爲火宗。其他各貨，各埠銷路均有。茲以時局不靖，交通阻滯，尤爲本市紙商致命之打擊。</p>
<p>就本市紙商業同業公會言，現擁有同業會員共五九九家。中紙組佔一百二十餘家，機紙組佔四百七十餘家。一般營業，均乏善足陳。而各紙號之營業開支，則有增無减。據悉：民國卅二年時，敵僞氣燄方張，投機囤積之風盛行時，該業會員，竟多至一千〇二家。現在已成陳蹟。一般應運而生之紙號，均隨時代淘汰。</p>
<p>就本市紙業工業公會言，亦擁有海龍，華倫，光中，勤工，民豐等共廿三家。此中大同，民豐，利用，華盛，華　等五家會員，廠址均在外埠。此般民營造紙工廠，在目前我國工業艱困之處境中，仍飽受原料貴，工銀高，利息昂種種威脅。復以外貨低價競銷，處境更屬一蹶不振。目前各廠開工情形，時斷時續，純視市面需要爲轉移。以目前出品言，連史紙尙有薄利可圖。他如毛邊，海月，招貼紙，灰報紙等，利潤已感勉强，白報紙之產品，價格品質，俱不能與外貨競一日之短長。各廠開工製造者，已屬絕無僅有。</p>
<p>至言經濟部接收之各廠，已開工者有天章東西兩廠，江南一二兩廠，櫻井感光紙廠及金星造紙廠等。據悉：此中以天章江南各廠處境較佳。蓋方承製大批鈔票紙。此外資委會台灣紙業公司，刻亦正擬在本市分設辦事處，以便推銷該公司之各種黃白紙版，招貼紙，白報紙等。美商中國紙版公司，現亦在開車巾，出品有各色紙版甚夥云。</p>
<h3>飛虎將軍　籌組航運公司　航委會未核准</h3>
<p>前在華對日作戰之飛虎隊領隊陳納德氏，近積極在滬籌設航空運輸公司，專司運輸救濟物資，來往中美兩國之間，該公司已呈請行政院核准，並準備下月間開始飛行，惟航空委員會及交通部，以我國創辦民營航空公司之辦法，尙未擬定，不論中外人士，均不准在我國設立航空公司，故對陳氏所組成之航空公司，已拒發准許飛行證件，並禁止擅自飛行。</p>
<h3>美棉價達最高峯　每磅美金三角八分</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十八日電〕紐約棉花期貨今日達新高峯，十月期及十二月期達每磅三角八分，對於後者爲一九一九年十二月以來之最高峯。其他近期則升達，一九二〇年以來之最高價。</p>
<h3>營業牌照稅　今日不申報　將照章處罰</h3>
<p>本市卅五年度營業牌照稅，前以調整資本額，限期於本年八月底爲申報納稅期間，嗣因限期已屆，延未申報者不少，財政局爲體恤商艱起見，自九月一日起，至月底止，再行展限一月，凡持照之各業商號，如尙未調整申報納稅者，可統於今最後一天內，携同舊照向該局牌照稅課申報，逾期者，決予照章處罰。</p>

<h3>福特汽車大王　怎樣管工人</h3>
<p>— 國紅</p>
<p>汽車大王福特氏的事業，我們耳熟已久，福特工人的生活，就傳聞所知，也頗有點動人的欣羨。但這些只是含混的傳聞而已。留美學生有署名羅乃士君的有一篇福特工廠實習記，特詳於該廠的勞動政策和工人生活，我現在將羅君的原文節譯如下，以供國內廠商的參考：</p>
<p>美國福特汽車公司，是一個極大的組織。牠有十萬個工人，每天平均出產三千輛車子。其中工人，形形色色，有全無技巧的，有技巧高深的，有美國本土人，有加拿大人，有歐洲人，有南美洲人，有亞洲西部人，有中國人（學生），情形非常複雜，凡關於汽車的一切製造營業事件，都有分類的工作。</p>
<p>組織的天才</p>
<p>福特公司的特點所在，是她的勞動政策，和因此而形成的工人生活。以福特氏組織的天才，他不但在物品生產上奏了功績，並且於勞資間的處置，也樹立了一點足以示範的規模。</p>
<p>福特公司對於殘廢工人，如目盲足跛的。都給有工作做，因爲工作的種類甚多，不難替略有殘廢的人找點事做，惟這些殘廢的人，往往限於以前曾服務公司而不幸致疾的。</p>
<p>福特工廠中的工頭，無開除工人之繼。工人間或工人與司事間有爭報時，工頭得令工人休工約十日左右。此限以上，則須由雇用事務部處決，如認爲工頭有誤，工人無咎時，則工人留廠，但轉向　部工作。</p>
<p>在福特工廠中的工人，或因醫藥的需要，或因才具的不宜，得隨意轉部工作，所以很有些從工人升到辦事人的。因此，工人一經雇用，便不會因工作不成而被開除。因各部轉換，總有適當的工作可做的。</p>
<p>每一個福特廠的工人初雇的兩個月，每天五元，第三個月便可得每天六元。增加工資的比率，以四角一次，加至七元二角時，便很不容易再增，增資依工作的性質與效率及對工頭之關係而定。</p>
<p>關於工人的訓練和敎育方面，有兩個組織。一是設於高地公園的福特工業訓練學校，一是附設於福會廠的學校部。工業訓練學校收容十二歲左右的兒童，一星期讀書，兩星期在工廠工作，目的在訓練成有技巧的機器匠，一切費用，由廠方供給。他們實習中的工作出品，就被實際應用。福曾廠的學校部，設立有三所學校，一所敎電學，一所敎修理機器及工具製作，一所專事於各地福特公司中司事的養成。前面的兩所，凡是福特工廠中的工人，都得於暇時入校讀書，也有考試，也發證書，學校畢業，得行加薪。不過雖有這個增進敎育的路，而福特廠的工人，大部分還是所謂非技巧的工人。因爲分工旣密，工人工作的手續弄得非常簡單，只消機械地做去，用不着學習了。</p>
<p>福特工廠有一個物品代辦委員會，計有四個營業部，一爲果蔬部，一爲肉物部，一爲藥品部，一爲衣履雜物部。專供工人購用，售價要比普通價格低百分之十至卞五。單是高地公園一廠，每日交易達三萬美金。</p>
<p>福特工廠中工人的生活，就在工廠中時講，則每日作工八小時。不過要早到遲退，及赴廠時途中的耗時，結果每個工人，每“須有九個半以至十個鐘頭的時問。工人午餐，由包飯作致送，每人一個食物的小盒，價格及性質，皆由廠方負責規定。每盒計有三塊夾肉麵包，一塊點心，一方餅干，一個頻果或香蕉或橘子。食鐘一鳴，工人紛赴送飯車，得盒後，任人隨地覓便進食。工廠就近住家的工人，則由其人自携食物來廠，按時進食。自備的食品，內容自然要比包飯作的好得多了。</p>
<p>緊張的工作</p>
<p>福特廠是晝夜開工的，八小時一班，一晝夜須換三班。工人或做夜工，或做日工，凡隔兩星期或一個月，互相掉換。三班計上午七八點鐘起至下午三四點鐘爲一班，自下午三四點鐘起至十一二點鐘爲一班，自下午十二點鐘至上午七八點鐘爲一班，這三個班，如兩星期掉換一次，每一工人於四十二天中，將三班盡行輪到。這種時間輪轉的辦法，於工人生活秩序上，非常有礙。但工廠方面，爲器件充分利用起見，也就沒法救濟。</p>
<p>福特工人，對於所做的工作和管理者的態度如何，這是應有的一個問題。對於這個問題，只有一個答案，即人同此心，工廠工人是根本不會主動的忠於工作的。福特廠中的工作，也一樣分作常例工作，和雜件工作兩類。常例工作，有一定的機器，一定的材料，一定的預料的產品，工人按常例做去，容不得你躱懶，即躲懶也容易被察覺。雜件工作，並不是常則的做某一件事的，搬動灑掃，隨時換事，因此工作無一定的責任意識，專想躱懶，決不肯努力的。</p>
<p>工人的福利</p>
<p>福特工廠的工人福利事業，也是頗爲著名的。爲了福利事業，廠方特設一調査部，此部工作人員的有一百多人。福特廠定最小工資每日五元，這是含有一種意義的。即此中包有工人對於利息分享。此利息的分享，以工人生活狀况改進爲條件。調査部的職務，即在調査工人生活，及作爲報吿，以備根據。不過這部事業已减縮得不少了。</p>
<p>福特工人的家庭生活，從粗惡到美化，種稱形式，各不相同。大部分工人，過的是標準頗高的生活。就普通講，他是年在三十五歲左右，有兩三個子女，他的妻子，年紀總要比他輕一點，她處家勤儉，也許能居積點錢。他的住宅，不論自有或租來，總很寬暢，常有餘室分租。家中設備器具，多屬完備，也有些圖書點綴，也有批亞拿或收音機，也有電話水電煤氣的設備，更不消說，他也有一輛福特廠出品的汽車，家常的三餐食品，都還過得去。當他穿着整齊的時候，正不亞一個普通的商人。</p>
<p>福特工人當然是不讀書的，他們中很少有曾達小學八年的學生，所以他不喜讀書，不喜聽講，不喜藝術，不喜音樂。但他對於日報，却是每天讀的。他雖然讀書不多，而儀表頗爲不俗，他有實際的知識，他懂得機械處理，懂得總畫，知道汽車的處理，也有點自然知識和衛生知識。對於娛樂事件，除於假日驅車遊散以外，或至郊外游泳漁獵，或行球戲，或打彈子，或看戲，或赴公園，或赴舞塲；趨向較惡的，便不免有賭博的行爲了。</p>
<h3>主管人員十誡</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>一個主管人員，要使他的事業成功，必須顧到各方面，這裏是十個必需遵行的規則：</p>
<p>（一）做出良好的榜樣，不要單用規則。</p>
<p>（二）對下要和善，一視同仁，那末下層也會對你尊敬。</p>
<p>（三）不要用手段，也不要用政治，公開坦白是最好的政策。</p>
<p>（四）要和各方面產生良好關係，一切言行，要從心裏發出來。</p>
<p>（五）改正錯誤要用建議舉例的方法，不要單用批評。</p>
<p>（六）不要輕易答應。在答應之前要仔細考慮，在答應之後，要切實實行。</p>
<p>（七）不要因爲別人批評而灰心不幹，任何事情都可以從兩方面講的。</p>
<p>（八）不要頑固，因爲你所對付的是人類，不是機構。</p>
<p>（九）與其命令下層負起責任，不如誘導下層，共同努力。</p>
<p>（十）所有舉動言語，要切實準確，使人容易了解實行。</p>
<h3>生產珍聞　代鐘錶的收音機</h3>
<p>— 亦知</p>
<p>美國有人在設計一種小收音機，專門收聽標準局內附設報時台的播音。不論日夜你只需撥動開關，就能聽到最正確的時間。</p>
<p>這收音機大小不及紙烟匣的一半，可以隨身携帶或置放於手提包內。</p>
<p>這種報時的服務將最先在紐的市舉辦，設短波台於最高一座大厦的頂樓，全日轉播華府標準局的時間，其準確程度可達只差千萬分之一秒，廣播中有時可插入簡單的天氣報吿，或最最新的新聞提要，歷時不過十秒鐘，設計人相信這事輕而易舉，無須大功本，將來那種袖珍收音機賣價不會比一隻好錶貴。</p>
<p>般尼四林供不應求</p>
<p>戰時以來，般尼四林用途日增，生產量也隨之增大，現在各方需要已多到每月八千萬萬單位，較目前全美國各實騐工塲的總產量允多一千萬萬單位。</p>
<p>美國政府爲了避免缺乏重新開始了購用限制，於是威斯康辛大學的植物學家正在加緊試騐，以便覺得迅速增加產量之產，他們已發現利用紫外光綫可以使產量激增。</p>
<p>最近美國農業部正以般尼西林試醫獸病，如結果良好，般尼西林的需要勢必又要大量增加，也許威斯康辛大學發明的辦法可以解決困難。</p>
<h3>中國出口貨展覽會</h3>
<p>— 鄧紹裘</p>
<p>中國出口貨展覽會的宣傳部長張一凡先生有一次很飽經世故的說：「現在經濟危機是十二分的嚴重，所以我們應得來提倡出品。此雖不合時宜，但我們得將目光看遠一點。我們不妨將它展覽出來，用統計表現出來，而讓大家有一個深刻的印像，讓關心出口事業的人士，有一個具體的材料，其體的事實，好去硏究改進。」</p>
<p>同座間的鍾可託先生，周經在這次無形中決定六家不妨嘗試相先生，欽湘舟先生，酈定摩先一下的希冀而成立了。生，當然他們也爲了幾個月來，經過近一個月，大家一面加市塲上充斥了美國貨，而不僅影强宣傳工作，一面計劃會塲的措響了若干公司商號的營業，且直置，一而和產業界人士保持密切接也在摧毀着本國國貨的發展危的接觸，此外還舉行過多次的專機有同感的，所以就在一凡先生業座會，輪流座談，及承美國大的提議下，中國出口貨展覽會就使館，巾美工商協進會，等熱心襄助，明天——十月一日，這應在中國出口史上佔有一頁的出口展覽會，將在廣大的觀衆前揭幕</p>
<p>展覽的會塲是在八仙橋靑年會，展覽陳列品的地位，每一百方呎爲一單位，全塲共有五十三個單位，各室分配情形是這樣的，三〇三室三個單位，佈置漆，陶器，搪瓷，骨器，三二〇。室四個單位，專門陳列桐油，交誼廳七單位，陳列五金，牙刷，皮，毛，油，猪鬃蛋製品，雪賡堂八單位——佈列花邊刺繡，針織棉織品，地毯，手帕，內衣，圖書館五單位——覧酒，茶，生絲，健身房二十六單位，計草帽，玻璃，熱水瓶，南北貨，燈泡，建築材料等等。</p>
<p>展覽品各參加廠商計有新光內衣織造廠，華德燈泡廠，新亞藥廠等五十餘家，展覽期爲六天</p>
<p>聽說該會並擬向各參觀者分送一特刋——「致全國產業界書」及「减低國貨成本」等，老生常談，但還是正確的。</p>
<p>經濟部長說挽救入超危機，第一要人民節的，第二要减低國貨成本，第三要提高國貨品質關於第一點現在人民民窮財畫，購買力又逐漸削弱，大多數節之又節，的無可的了，而第二點和第三點是有聯繫性的，成本减低才可以將品質提高。而現在我們成本不能减低，是由於稅額太重，所以我們今天一致的要求是要免徵貨物稅，以維護此尙在萌牙之國貨工商業，减少成本，才不致外商摧毁。</p>

<h3>絲與耐綸</h3>
<p>— 任衡亮</p>
<p>最近美國玻璃絲襪（耐綸Nylon）充斥市上，論其品質，固然稍佳於國產橫機舞襪，但價格方面，玻璃絲襪須三萬多元一雙，國產絲襪僅一萬元一雙，故若以價格之大小，與品質之優劣，作一比蛟，穿國產絲襪還是合算的，不過近來國人以用外貨爲榮之心理，已蔚成風氣，其實這是一種極端的謬誤觀念，美貨的優美，這是不能抹煞的事實，但好到如何程度，當然也有個限度，今將耐綸與天然絲之品質作一比較。（表據化學世界第一卷三期）</p>
<p>由上所述，耐綸絲襪與天然絲襪比較，其優劣至多相差百分之五十而已，即一雙半蠶絲襪，就可抵得一雙耐綸絲襪，但價格方面，耐綸絲襪竟高出蠶絲襪三倍之多，且耐綸絲襪據穿過者言，夏天不吸濕，有引起皮膚病可能，冬天不保溫，穿在脚上冰陰，蠶絲襪則毫無此種弊病，而外表方面也同樣漂亮。</p>

<h3>新的神話</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>我的老朋友潘齊洛尼，是一個羅馬城里的小公務員。他不想飛黃騰達，可是他不住的在抱怨他的地位。因此，有一天我對他說：「爲什么不想想辦法，改善你的景況？往上爬，弄一個高些的位置，就容易對付這個生活了。」聽了我的話，他說：「什麼，呌我去爬一架盡是這批傢伙堆起來的梯子嗎？」我說：「改變他，我從來沒有聽見過這話。天下那有從上面發生的革命，除非你的意思是指一切高級官吏，外交官及政治家的集體自殺。你難道真的相信，當你已經習慣於這種生活，這種腐化，尤其是這種壞人性的奴氣之後，你還能夠改變那已經改變了你整個人性的東西嗎？一個人被他自己的糞便所吞咽掉，你聽見過這種事情沒有？」</p>
<p>一件事情，他是贊成慕縈里尼乃至希特勒，那就是「我們需要一種新的神話，」他說：「我已經得到了這神話了。譬如，以國家爲例。一個國家就好比一隻野獸。牠的姿勢是一條在玩兒的狗。下巴站住在地板上，夾在兩個前爪中間。後半個身子支起在牠的兩條后腿。一代一代的青年人就像在地板上爬向狗嘴里讓牠吞噬的蟲豸一樣。那狗就老實不客氣地用牠的大舌頭吃了這些蟲豸，于是嚼爛他們，于是吞進了牠們。是的，我的神話就從此開頭了，因爲牠是把這些蟲豸們吞上去的，不是吞下去的。這些蟲豸們被吞上去之后，在這個政治的或官僚的肚子里的地位愈來愈高，每一個小公務員都希望他自己比別人更快些消化掉。希望儘可能順溜出來，直到他終於「出頭」了。以後的事我也不必描寫了。你知道他們鑽出來之後，人家就呌他們爲「老爺」了。親愛的朋友們，你們都希望很快地超升顯赫，而我寧可被遺留在黑暗的狗肚子裏永不消化。」</p>
<p>附注：「這是一段譯文，我自己還寫不出來。原作是一個在美國作家的意大利人倪哥樂·杜豈所寫，載在同志評論一九四六冬季號中。」</p>
<h3>黃自的作品的再現</h3>
<p>— 梁酉延</p>
<p>在中國作曲家中，人們最喜歡的該是黃自先生，他的天倫歌與趙元任的「教我如何不想他」一樣，所受人們的欣賞，歷久不變；這說明好的藝術都有着永久性的價值。</p>
<p>比起去年在莫斯科逝世的冼星海或者現仍健在的賀綠汀，在作品的量的方面，黃自先生是比較少；但黃自的成功秘訣也就在於：只求出品精，不求產量多；這一點正和戲劇家曹禺的成功一樣。</p>
<p>在黃自的作品中，大至器樂的序曲「懷舊曲」——他在美國耶魯大學音樂院時，以此曲榮獲畢業首獎，造成他在國外的地位。——小至小歌曲「花非花」（白居易詞），以及婦孺皆知的「天倫」歌，「青天白日滿地紅」（合唱曲，據說，當初此曲準備作我國國歌的，但未中選；其實許多人都以爲這一曲的旋律情調比今日的國歌更壯麗。）「旗正飄飄」，「熱血」，「國旗歌」，………可以說沒有一個不是饒有濃烈的情感及無窮的味兒，即使是不大Musicai的人，聽到黃自的歌曲，準會覺得「一聽就懂而百聽不厭」的。但有一點值得注意的是：好的歌曲不一定大都懂，而討好大眾的音樂并不都好。但是，黃自的東西則兩方面都顯到了：既能爲多方面的人所接受，而又不妨害自身獨特風格；他的作品中，并不高深也不俗氣，有時候，在他的旋律中也充滿着兩方味道，如「旗正飄飄」的一開頭就是；但他同時也善於發揮東方的情調的妙處，例如「天倫」歌的開頭一句（用中國的五音階進行其旋律）。研究他的成功，當由於善取東方與西方情調的妙處，同時又善於調和這兩種極端的成分。這，就是黃自風格的由來，這就是他創作他自己獨創的風格的方法。</p>
<p>在中國音樂家中，國樂方面，我崇拜已故的劉天華先生，西樂方面，我頂喜歡黃自的作品。但不幸他倆都是短命的藝術家，黃自死時只有三十四歲。他比短命音樂家莫扎爾德（享年三十五歲），還短一歲。他看見抗戰爆發，但他看不見戰爭勝利，（他死於廿七年四月）不過，他卻已爲民族的鬥爭盡了力，他寫了「抗敵歌」，「旗正飄飄」，都是抗戰歌曲中之出類者。</p>
<p>我沒有撒謊，也沒有故意強調，我真愛黃自的作品。所以，這次上海音樂社主辦的「黃自作品演奏會」，我趕去聽了最后一天的演出。</p>
<p>清唱劇「長恨歌」：「……只恨人間恩愛總難戀，如今專寵多榮幸，怕紅顔老去，卻像秋風團扇冷。……</p>
<p>紅塵碧海，多少癡情種，離合悲歡，枉作相思夢，參不透，鏡花水月畢竟成空。」</p>
<p>這一節目，以混聲合唱或與二重唱及交響樂隊伴奏演出，指揮是黃永熙先生。合唱的組織，還很健全；本來聲樂的組織比器樂的組織更難，一個合唱團人才的配備與訓練，往往是吃力不討好。在這合唱團裏，大多是來自各方的職業青年，他們有獻身於音樂的決心，但是爲了生活，他們只能把音樂作爲業餘的寄託。也就是因此，一個合唱團的組織與訓練真不容易，上海音樂社這次參加演奏的合唱團，其女聲部及男聲部都還算盡責。黃先生的指揮，也極幹脆有力，許多小地方，尤其交待清楚，花樣既不太多，看起來也還能發生「指揮給以美感」的副作用。</p>
<p>參加長恨歌第二節「七月七日長生殿」的二重唱的那位小姐，音量較弱，因此在樂隊的伴奏中，她的聲音簡直很微弱了，而感情也就無法表現。高之蘭小姐在一襯托下，更顯得她的「玫瑰三願」唱得高明，因而被「再來一個」。她在重來的第二遍中，發音更純了，因爲在第一遍中，旋律高處行時，她的聲音好像有些「沙沙」之感，而第二遍中沒有了。</p>
<p>演奏會在「旗正飄飄」的四部混聲合唱中結束，這個節目異常興奮，聽眾同樣地又要求再來一個。因而這次演奏總算十分圓滿。在上海，偉大的聲樂太缺乏了，回想日本在多年以前就曾演奏貝多芬的合唱交響樂（第九交響樂），尤令人覺得上海有急應建立聲樂組織的需要！於此，謹祝上海音樂社更強大！同時，更感謝黃自先生給予我們的豐盛遺產！</p>

<h3>在村子裏</h3>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>炊煙</p>
<p>至這裏來——這個荒涼了三年的村子，我看到低矮的茅舍又升起了裊裊的炊煙，這總經過災難洗刦的土塊開始復活了。</p>
<p>沉默的古老的水車又在河邊歌唱了。綠色的田野騰起一片播種的歡笑，嘹喨的山歌滾響在藍空中，飛鳥自由的翱翔在天上，野花芬芳撲鼻…………我們底村莊在春天裏成長起來了。</p>
<p>我們底辛勞的農民不再坐在河邊哭泣了。</p>
<p>今天，他們擁有了這片廣大的土地，眾多的牲口和耕作的工具……他們底日子才愉快呢！他們底生活才恬靜呢！他們底生命的光輝正照得明亮呢！</p>
<p>於是村子里又升起一縷縷裊裊的炊煙縈繞在黃昏的天空中。</p>
<p>牛欄</p>
<p>在那間灰暗而陰濕的牛欄里，牛犢們低聲地嘶叫着，咀嚼着農婦們剛從田野間割回來的含有多量露珠的嫩綠小草。一個小女孩站在牛欄外癡癡地張望着，在她底小小的心靈里想從那間深邃的牛欄裏掘發些什麽呢？</p>
<p>蜘蛛網密密的掛在屋樑上，　屋簷下懸一盞破舊的燈籠，晚風從牛欄裏吹出來一陣陣的腐臭的氣息。</p>
<p>在往年，災難降臨的日子，農人沒了牲口，沒有了耕地，終日喘息在饑餓的死亡上綫上，牛欄是靜靜的白天裏做着黑夜的惡夢。</p>
<p>如今，牛欄從長夜的惡夢裏驚醒過來了，眾多的牛犢擁擠在一起嘶叫着，低敵的茅屋洋溢着一片生底歡呼。</p>
<p>鄉村小道</p>
<p>今天，我走在用鵝卵石英鐘來鋪砌成的鄉村底小道上，我底心感到很愉快，我看到我們底勞動人民又開始在田野間工作了。</p>
<p>他們一個個怱忙地走着，嘴裏哼着山歌，帶着各人工作的農具，種籽和肥料。……</p>
<p>當收獲的季節到來時，他們是多麼忙碌，連孩子們也得工作呀！有了工作，他們底生命就顯得堅實啦。……</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　48</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>然而當時，捷報頻傳，一而再，而三，要說我絲毫不感覺興奮，痛快，那也是不近人情的假話就因這一下興奮，我帶着這些好消息，匆匆跑到鼎元那裏，逐條逐段的告訴了他們一家。剛剛說畢，本站的外勒，也趕了進來，報告「宛平我軍，已將附近日陣　軍，盡數趕走，現正追擊。」</p>
<p>「可惜！」鼎元本來在床上靠着枕坐着，聽了這些報捷消息，猛然一拍床沿，把身體坐直了；一時無法……</p>
<p>我正要聽他「可惜」什么，「一時無法」怎樣，卻見他怔怔地注視着薄薄一屋被單下面，自己的一雙大腿。</p>
<p>「怎樣說？」他不說，我祇好問了。他的太太和梅君都在跟前，也楞住了，不知他想到了什么。</p>
<p>「我很想……」他停了一停，「我很想趁這時候，上北平去一趟，可惜怕還這雙腿……不成……」</p>
<p>「哥，您何必急？」梅君插口問。</p>
<p>「真的，您聽，打的正熱鬧哪，就是有車，精神撐得住，也怕流彈哩。……」吳太太也勸着。</p>
<p>梅君不等她母說完，接口說「照剛才岳伯伯說的，咱們軍隊打得恁們好，何不再等一半天，索性讓他們再打過去一些，您精神也更好一點，要上北平還不是現成的嗎？」</p>
<p>「孩子，」鼎元正色瞧着梅君，「你的意思，我很明白，怕我身體撐不住，又怕路上不好走，有危險。你要知道，咱們一家，雖不像一般人，口號「以身許國」這一類好聽的話，可得知道「軍情如火」；也許這時候，就短着我這們一個懂電訊的，也短着你們這樣的看護。再說，危險的話，不是我大清早找晦氣，將來在軍隊裏，還能說有危險就不上前？不瞧咱們的軍隊，還往砲裏衝呢？……」</p>
<p>「我打算，」他又前瞧我，「我打算費您心，「送佛送到西天」，想法子給弄部車子；要是大車，咱們全要去，車小，我帶着士仁，咱們爺兒倆去，他有這們大，也可以扶着我一點，老大哥，您看？……」</p>
<p>我沉呤了一下，瞧了瞧梅君和吳太太。她們正注視着我，大約想我也說兩句勸阻的話。我覺得他們現在是兩個意見，雙方也各有各的理由：一邊是在爭着「把握時機」，一邊是爭着安全問題。</p>
<p>「我看」，我沖着他們全家三巨頭說話，大哥，大嫂，大姪女，咱們不算外人，我可把話說在前頭。大哥的意見，不能算錯；大嫂，大姪女的話，也有充份的理由。要車子，有的是，只要我給北平去一個電話，小車，大車，甚至二部三部我都能辦到。安全的問題，我可不能担保，因爲打仗的事，瞬息萬變。可是，爲了大哥的事，我可以陪着去，陪着回來，哪怕多繞點灣兒呢，咱們很可朝西繞道，到火灰廠；不成，再朝西到戒台寺，或門頭溝，也不過多繞這們一半小時。要是快的話，咱們辦完了事很能趕回家吃午飯，慢一點，晚飯以前很可到家了。……不過，總管一句，總管一句，總得您全家一致意見……您幾位看？……」我並非老成故，不肯代人負責。您想，這樣兵荒馬亂的年頭，誰敢替誰，負這樣的責任？</p>

<h3>獻校祝壽</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>蔣主席今年六句大慶，有人侶議，獻校祝壽，寓作育英才於紀念元首的豐功偉績之中，此舉頗有意義，記得抗戰前兩年，主席五旬大慶之年，全國有獻機祝壽之舉，那一運動所收的效果，對於以後的抗戰，實實在在裨益匪淺；現在抗戰業已勝利，建國爲當前急務。而建國最首要的工作，就是普及敎育，培養人才，獻校運動與十年前的獻校運動可說　　歸了時代精神。</p>
<p>斯文掃地。這　淪亡，經過了八年戰爭，不僅敎育破產，更毁滅了道德，我們眼看到目前社會之各種違法亂紀的現象，實在痛心已極，倘使不從我們這一代力謀補救，不再爲下一代着想，我們這個民族的前途。誠不堪設想！</p>
<p>學校缺乏，這情形在各省的較小縣份較偏僻的地區更甚。學生繳不起學費：凡此，很自然地使下一代的知識發生問題。</p>
<p>紀念主席的大慶，用這一方法，恐怕最爲主席所樂於朁同，因爲它同時解救了目前學生失學的痛苦。希望大家能急起響應，共襄此舉。</p>
<p>心理衛生</p>
<h3>如何控制情緒</h3>
<p>— 桂庭</p>
<p>正如駕駛一匹馬一樣</p>
<p>情緒的衝動，能够使一個人的心臟跳躍得更快，血壓增高，並且甚至於招致肌肉的痙攣。過分的厭惡可能使一個人作悶嘔吐，而驚恐過度也可能使一個人當塲暈倒。</p>
<p>根據哈佛大學神經學敎授卡納爾醫學博士（G．Colket　Caone　M．D．）的意見，這並不是爲了人家的言語行動才使我們覺得不快意或疲倦。主要的原因還是在於我們自己情緒的反應。假使我們完全無動乎中，旣不憤怒，又不妒忌，那末隨便什麽人都不能够擾亂我們的情緒的。</p>
<p>老實說，情緒的衝動並非一件壞的事情。它在許多方面能够協助身體準備種種行動，例如，促進肌肉裏血液的循環並且在血液裏添進了許多糖質來供給特殊的力量。</p>
<p>興奮與衝動</p>
<p>一個人的情緒，如果不衝動起來，他決不能够發表一篇精采的演詞的。同樣一個運動家如果覺得一些都不興奮，他也決不能够在賽跑裏獲得冠軍。</p>
<p>但是，情緒的衝動祇有在刺激我們預先考慮如何應付未來的環境或者鼓勵我們積極與環境奮鬥的塲合，才對於我們有所裨益。然而大多數擾亂我們情緒的原因，却在於各式各樣威脅的因素；比方說，失去了我們最親愛的人，家庭環境的壓迫，健康的影響，失業的憂慮，和經濟的困難等。假使我們懷疑自己的能力是吾能够應付自如，新的環境對於我們使足以造成一種可怖的威脅了。</p>
<p>訓練你自己</p>
<p>因此，我們必須訓練自己，在被威脅的時候如何積極去考慮，計劃，以及應付新的環境。我們對於各種威脅的因素，必須採取積極反應的態度。這才是人人應抱的最合理的態度。這種態度就是二「無論什麼事情發生，我們必須從容應付。」這是與「我們希望這樣事情不致於發生罷」的態度完全相反的。這樣做法，我們自然會鎭定自若，決不會徒作杞人之憂。即使有什麽意外事情發生，我們早已經充分準備應付了。</p>
<p>另一方面，我們如果抱着「我們希望這樣事情不致於發生罷」的態度，則無時無地總覺得惴惴不安。即使許久相安無事，我們總是仍然覺得不安定的。因爲意料中事情發生的可能性總是存在的。這樣的態度於是招致了焦慮的情緒，疲乏和其他生理上的病徵如心跳或消化不良等症。</p>
<p>情緒的控制正如控制一匹馬一樣。我們必須學習如何駕馭它，使它時時就範，並且訓練它在無論任何情形之下能够勇往直前，繼續邁進。這樣我們才能控制情緒，使其發揮無上的效力。</p>
<p>肌肉的緊張</p>
<p>情緒上的病　多　是　於肌肉緊張所致。所以，把肌肉鬆懈起來，使它享受充分的休息，對於心理上會發生無限鎭靜的作用。把我們的肌肉鬆懈起來，就會感覺着：「件件事情都已　妥當了」。因此，我們必須　成隨時隨地休息的能力和習慣。讓我們每日掉開所有公私事務，靜靜地休息數分種，並且休息多幾次。我們早上未起身前以及晚上未上床睡覺之前是休息最理想的時候。</p>
<p>完全的休息</p>
<p>常一個人上床睡覺的時候，他應該把全身的肌肉鬆懈起來，並且讓腦筋享受完全的休息。他絕對不應該再用腦筋，或者傷腦筋。他應該把腦子澄淸到眞空一樣，使它憇息，休　。至於白天睡眠與否，到是不一定需要的，所需要者還是休息，眞正的休息，充分的休息。我們必須學習如何休息，才能控制我們的情緒，增進我們身心的幸福（本文內容取材於卡納爾醫學博士名著「如何應付環境」）。</p>
<h3>零碎</h3>
<p>— 莫高</p>
<p>在南斯拉夫悲劇演州後，有位美國記者說起打狗的方法，是要一棍子打得它翻不來身，他說：「好人讓一步，惡狗進兩步，好人還一脚，惡狗便非逃跑不可了。」</p>
<p>這不但對於美國當前的警語，也眞是對着我國國情，一針見血的棒　。</p>
<p>美國勞工節那天，日銷四百六十萬份的紐約每日新聞上有一篇社評，紀念勞工節及勝利節。在最後的結語上說：「如果現在我們把原子彈製造的秘密，吿訴了另一國家，那我們無異全身赤裸。」</p>
<h3>第二天性</h3>
<p>— 莫</p>
<p>在養成一種新習慣之前，你應該決心考騐自己是否能够治理自己。</p>
<p>一經走上了新的道路，就不該再有例外發生，猶如把已經繞好了的綫球拋下地去一樣。一步錯誤的步子，往往會把以前的努力究全摧毁。</p>
<p>隨時把你的好意思，付諸實行；但如果你的好習慣已經發生了相當成效，你却不可沾沾自喜，更不該就此滿足。</p>
<p>習慣的好處，在於能够使我們始終如一，習慣是良好社會進步的輪軸，在一個良好社會中，每個人都先有良好習慣的養成，假使你不如意，牠能帶着我們度過這天煩惱的時光，輔助我們做那煩碎的惱人的雜務。鼓勵我們去幹重要的工作，牠更能使我們節省心智的力量，增加精確的程序。</p>
<p>好的習慣愈多，則生活愈容易，抵抗引誘的力量亦愈增加。</p>
<p>「習慣雖不等於天性，習慣却是第二天性。」</p>
<h3>商人之心</h3>
<p>— 文漪</p>
<p>回憶上海淪陷於日寇的後一年，某一次，我和一個米商偶然談起國事，他說：</p>
<p>「……：不過中國若是亡給日本，於我們米商倒沒有什麽大害；因爲日本人也是吃米的。若是中國亡給吃麵包的國家，那麽咱們做米商的才沒生路走呢！」　　孫立人在印緬前綫</p>
<p>勝利以前，史迪威與孫立人在印緬前綫商議反攻。</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>名將孫立人</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>在中國，眞正是美國西點軍校畢業學生，只有幾個人，而在這幾人當中，曾在戰塲上建立奇功名揚中外的是孫立人將軍。</p>
<p>軍中佳話</p>
<p>這在勝利以前，印緬戰塲的中美官兵，對孫立人的大名無一人不知，而且，每一個人在心坎裏都刻着一個極深刻的印象。史迪威將軍曾對駐印軍鄭副總指揮洞國將軍說：「中國將領也頂好」！然而，最使人不能忘懷的首推新一軍軍長孫立人。</p>
<p>記得在卅三年二月，孫將軍因指揮胡康河谷孟關會戰，麽攻不克，戰事至爲激烈。當時，他曾發誓將滿臉的黑鬍子留起來，並且，堅決的吿訴他的戰友：「不入孟關，不剃　子」—後來，三月九日孟關終於攻克。孫將軍也就剃光了每一根鬍鬚。從此，他的這一段趣事，留傳在印緬戰塲成爲佳話。</p>
<p>他原是淸華大學畢業生，後來到美國留學；因對軍事發生興趣。便入西點軍校攻讀。因此，美國的軍官們都知道他是中國的大學畢業生，很看得起他。他的英文講德非常流利，常與美國軍官滔滔不絕地長談。也正因此，他與美國軍界人物，弄得燜熟。</p>
<p>軍人本色</p>
<p>在平時你看到他溫文爾雅的態度，以爲他是一個儒才，在戰塲你看到他勇敢善戰堅苦卓絕的精神，你不得不承認他是一個勇將。他一到了戰塲，完全顯示其軍人本色，只要他下了決心，要攻打某一個地方，無論如何困難一定都要打下來。要是部下稍有疏忽軍令之處，立刻懲辦。他這一種作風不僅部下不敢亂來，連美國的官兵也同樣的畏　。凡是受他指揮的美國官兵都十分小心。</p>
<p>據說，一個美國傳令兵傳達一件公文給他，因爲不　中國的陸軍禮節。按照美國作　　進了他的辦公室，他頓時大發雷　，一定要這一個美兵按陸軍禮節的規定來做，那美兵眞急得大傷腦筋，只好在門口用英語先喊：“Repott”然後，等到他在裏面　答：「Come　in」那美籍傳令兵才敢進去，再繼續的照規矩行了十五度的鞠躬禮，雙手將公文捧遞給了他，簽過了字後，那美兵取回收文簿，照例又一個十五度行禮，才步出他的辦公室。向從這一次以後，美國的官兵對於中國的禮節特別注意，尤其在孫立人的面前，更不敢隨便。</p>
<p>赴歐考察</p>
<p>他帶兵極嚴，屢建奇功，頗得蔣委員長的嘉許，及艾森豪威爾將軍的器重；所以在印緬反攻吿捷，德國投降，歐洲戰事結束，艾森豪威爾將軍特派專機接孫將軍到巴黎去視察歐洲戰塲，及德國軍隊的工事與陣地，直到今年五月才廳道日本，遄返回國。</p>
<p>最近，他已榮任了第四綏　區司令官，兼長春警備司令，四平街一役之後，東北的共軍對於這一位　戰印　的勇　，也不能不佩服。</p>

        <h1>1946 - n273</h1>
<h3>Chairman and Wife Visited Linggu Temple Yesterday, Government to Issue Statement on the Current Situation, Dong Biwu Visits U.S. Envoy to Discuss Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] It is reported that the government will issue a document regarding the current situation. The document has been finalized and is expected to be released on the 30th. Furthermore, the Chairman, accompanied by his wife, visited Linggu Temple in the morning of the 29th, leisurely strolling along the mountain paths, unburdening their minds in the autumn sun. In the afternoon, they also visited Xuanwu Lake. At 7:30 PM, they hosted a dinner for Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Stuart. Ambassador Stuart and his advisor, Fu Jingbo, were also invited to attend. After the meal, they watched a movie together. In addition, Ambassador Stuart had no other activities on the 29th besides attending church in the afternoon, only attending the dinner at the Marshall's residence in the evening. It is also heard that the Ambassador will visit the Chairman on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The situation for peace negotiations is gradually brightening. To achieve peace as soon as possible, the government has accepted the suggestion of Envoy Marshall to advance military and political negotiations simultaneously. The conference procedures are still under discussion and were not finalized on the 29th. However, it is said that the government's attitude remains in favor of simultaneous progress, with politics taking precedence over military matters. Since learning that the Chairman had once again accepted this suggestion, all parties in the capital have admired the Chairman's eagerness for peace and have been in more frequent contact. At 10:00 AM on the 29th, Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan visited Envoy Marshall's residence and did not leave until 1:30 PM, still discussing negotiation methods and ceasefire issues. The government's acceptance of Envoy Marshall's new negotiation proposal has also been conveyed to Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan, with the hope that Zhou Enlai can return to Nanjing immediately. Dong Biwu will convey this intention to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai on the evening of the 29th. If Zhou has no other opinions, it is expected that he will return to Nanjing soon. Furthermore, reliable sources state that reports in various newspapers about Stuart and Marshall having a new plan and organizing a comprehensive conference to discuss military matters first and then political matters are all speculative due to nervousness.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Since Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, peace negotiations have been progressing daily. Communist representatives Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan visited Envoy Marshall at 10:00 AM on the 29th to exchange opinions on the ceasefire issue, departing after two and a half hours. It is heard that Marshall informed Dong that the government would accept his and Ambassador Stuart's new proposal to simultaneously negotiate political and military issues. General observation suggests that the government's negotiations with the Communists will be based on political issues. General Marshall hosted a dinner at his residence in the evening for Madam Chiang, who recently returned to Nanjing, and invited Ambassador Stuart and Fu Jingbo to accompany them. Marshall and Stuart further discussed the current developments regarding peace negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] The government personnel of the Three-Man Military Group are currently preparing documents with relevant negotiation materials. The date of Zhou Enlai's arrival in Nanjing has not yet been determined. Dong Biwu will represent the Communists and Zhou in the meetings, but Zhou has not completely withdrawn from the negotiations.</p>
<h3>National Army Encircles Shuyang City, Communist Troops West of Huaiyin Have Been Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 29th] The National Army outside Shuyang is intensifying its advance and has completed the encirclement. The county is expected to be recovered in the short term.

<h3>Communist Party's Extraordinary Committee Opposes Mao Zedong's Line, Advocates a Shift from Armed Struggle to Peaceful Development</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] The military announced on the 29th a document obtained from the Communist Party's Extraordinary Committee in the Communist area opposing Mao Zedong's line. The document shows that there are differences of opinion within the Communist Party and that rifts have occurred. The Extraordinary Committee criticized the failure of the military adventures in northern Jiangsu as an error of Mao Zedong's line, and proposed opposing Mao Zedong's line and overthrowing "fascism." The document stated that the Communist Party has relaxed all efforts to strive for peace, underestimated the strength of the government, miscalculated the domestic and international situation, and embarked on military adventures, leading to the current difficult situation. The Extraordinary Committee advocated a shift to the road of peaceful democracy, from armed struggle to peaceful development, striving for national democracy from local democracy, and joining hands with all parties in accordance with the opinions of the entire people. It also pointed out that Mao Zedong was afraid of unity and trembled at the mention of orthodoxy, which was cowardly and shameless. Finally, it demanded guarantees for Communist Party members who laid down their arms and opposed the use of retaliatory measures against party members who faithfully implemented peace and livelihood.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Launch Another Destructive Offensive Against the Longhai and Jinpu Railways, Communist Troops in Southern Shandong Conscripting Large Numbers of Soldiers to Send to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 28th] At 9:00 PM on the 26th, Communist troops launched another destructive offensive against the Longhai Line. Communist troops planted landmines three kilometers east of Luowang Station, bombing a mixed train departing from Xuzhou. The train had over a thousand passengers, with many deaths and injuries. An unknown number of Communist troops fought fiercely with the railway protection troops while destroying two kilometers of track. The Communist troops retreated at 1:00 AM this morning. The Longhai Line has been cut off again and may be repaired on the 28th. Passengers have been concentrated at Luowang Station.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 28th] The 71st mixed train on the Longhai Railway, Xuzhou-Bian section, heading east, detonated a Communist landmine three kilometers east of Luowang on the night of the 26th. Over 300 Communist troops took the opportunity to destroy one kilometer of track. If repairs go smoothly, traffic may resume on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 28th] According to government reports, Communist troops in southern Shandong are conscripting large numbers of soldiers and sending them to northern Jiangsu to replenish their forces. 2,000 new militiamen were conscripted in Linyi and sent to the Taierzhuang front line. The Jinpu Railway continues to be damaged by Communist troops. The railway between Tai'an and Yanzhou has been completely destroyed by Communist troops who conscripted civilians, and the Panghe Bridge south of Tai'an has been completely demolished. A large number of new weapons continue to arrive in Yantai, all transported by the Communist troops from Dalian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] Since the National Army recovered Heze (Caozhou) in western Shandong, the surrounding villages have also been peaceful. The Lanhe Highway from Lanfeng to Caozhou has also been cleared. When the National Army first moved in, the Communist troops implemented a scorched-earth policy, removing all food from the people. Now, after pacification, many of the people who were coerced and held hostage have returned to their homes. The number of Communist troops surrendering rises every day. Currently, our military and government are working together to settle the area and organize Baojia. Furthermore, Commander Liu Ruming of the Fourth Pacification District arrived in the county seat on the morning of the 28th, conveying the central government's intentions.</p>
<h3>Zhu De Arrives in Zhangjiakou to Plan Defense, Chahar Province Becomes Military Focus, National Army Advancing from Northern Henan Recovers Cixian</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] The military situation in North China is focused on Chahar, presenting a sense of impending storm. Director of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters Li Zongren also does not speak clearly. The situation in Chahar Province may become clear soon. However, overall, the provinces of Hebei, Rehe, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Henan have not yet moved beyond the stage of active preparation and containment. Sun Lianzhong told reporters yesterday that the National Army will clear the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, but did not mention the Pingsui line. Wang Hongshao, a staff officer at the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, also denied that the Hebei-Rehe National Army has begun operations against Chahar. He seemed quite confused by the recent conflicting news reports. The "Observer" has also issued inconsistent statements. The focus of the future battle, whether in eastern Chahar, western Chahar, or northern Chahar, is debated. Besides the Communist troops voluntarily abandoning 32 locations in eastern and western Chahar that were indefensible, there is no evidence that the National Army has formally launched an attack. The strength of the National Army in Rehe is quite strong, which seems close to the truth. Reports of encircling Chang and forcing Dolun are definitely not accurate, but Dolun will eventually be a contested place, because gaining that location can control northern Rehe and cut off the main communication line of the Communist troops in the Northeast. Currently, the military affairs of the southwestern half of Rehe Province from Chifeng in a straight line to the south have been assigned to the Eleventh War Zone, while the other half remains under the Northeast Headquarters. After the military affairs in eastern Suiyuan come to an end, the so-called Fu Zuoyi troops have advanced into Chahar, which cannot be confirmed. Insiders say that a short period of reorganization is needed after the Jining battle. In Hebei Province, in addition to the tense deployment on the Hebei-Chahar border, the actions of the two armies in central and southern Hebei in recent days seem to be containing Chahar Province. The National Army around Baoding is gradually developing outwards, while the Communist troops are actively threatening the northern section of the Pinghan Line. Bombing incidents, which have not been heard of for months, occurred again yesterday near Dongchangshou. After the Communist troops in eastern Hebei suffered losses, the main force in central Hebei is on the Pinggu Line, containing actions on the Hebei-Chahar border. The National Army advancing north from Anyang in northern Henan has recovered Cixian, threatening Liu Bocheng's base in Handan and Shun, De, and containing Liu's troops in southern Hebei from being transferred north. Communist troops in Shanxi Province have launched a full-scale counterattack to cover the emptiness of northern Shanxi. Governor Yan said at the memorial week a few days ago that the military victory in eastern Suiyuan has not yet alleviated the crisis in Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] Why the National Army has been slow to advance on Zhangjiakou has become a mystery that the press here wants to uncover. Some sensitive observers believe that after Stalin's speech, the international situation has become more moderate, so Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing early to re-discuss the possibility of a peaceful solution, which is why the advance on Zhangjiakou has been delayed. Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, also told reporters at a cocktail party for U.S. military dependents last night that the military plans and actions in North China can be changed by Nanjing at any time according to the political situation, and clearly stated that peace negotiations can affect military actions at any time.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 29th] Amidst the rumors of a major battle brewing in southern Hebei, the National Army has approached Handan. The Communist troops have deployed strong forces in the counties around Handan, including Yongnian, Cheng'an, Shahe, Nanhe, Pingxiang, and Jize. Fierce battles are imminent.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 29th] Bridge No. 80, 64 kilometers between Jingxing and Nanyu on the Zhengtai Railway, was destroyed by Communist troops planting landmines on the 28th. One span of the bridge was destroyed and will take approximately three days to repair.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] The Communist troops near Datong are fleeing in different directions towards Guancunpu and Julepu east of the railway, trying to control the Tongyang-Gaotai highway. Chen Zhengxiang, the leader of the Communist troops, recently convened a meeting of cadres from the Jin-Ji Military Region and reportedly decided to abandon the railway line and launch attacks on the National Army on the spot. In other news, due to the repeated military setbacks of the Communist Party, Zhu De was specially dispatched from Yan'an to Zhangjiakou to plan the defense.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] Amidst the sound of war drums, the weekend was spent leisurely. Last night, senior military leaders such as Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong attended the cocktail party at Huai Ren Hall and watched Xiao Cuihua's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and Zhang Junqiu's "Fenhe Bay." The headquarters also had a concert, resembling a peaceful scene. Although the sky in Beiping today is clear and vast, there are few military planes, and the headquarters is in a semi-holiday state. Officials have not confirmed the report of entering Kangzhuang. In eastern Hebei, Jianchangying is still occupied by Communist troops, with no new developments. In eastern Suiyuan and northern Shanxi, the major battles have just ended, and urgent rest and reorganization are needed, with no immediate signs of advancing. The report here that troops have entered Shangdu and Shangyi is likely to be local guerrillas. Some sources say that the 16th Army will be airlifted to eastern Suiyuan to participate in the operations of the 12th War Zone, but this has not been confirmed. Whether the current peace in North China is the beginning of peace or the calm before the storm remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 29th] A military official defending Datong flew to Beiping last night, claiming that after Fu Zuoyi's troops lifted the siege of Datong, they continued to advance east in coordination with some of the Datong garrison, approaching Yanggao, an important town in western Chahar.</p>
<p>[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 28th] The military here confirmed on the 28th that eastern Suiyuan and Horinger County have been recovered. With this, the territory of Suiyuan Province has been restored, and the four counties in eastern Suiyuan occupied by the Communist troops have been recovered by the National Army one after another. The city of Suiyuan is exceptionally joyous today.</p>
<p>[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 28th] After the National Army recovered Jining, they have successively recovered Longshengzhuang and Xinghe County, and order and morale have been stabilized. The entire eastern Suiyuan has taken on a new atmosphere (Note: Suiyuan is now a complete province in North China).</p>
<p>[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 26th] According to Shi Zhiren, who arrived in Suiyuan today, the National Army on the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway has approached Huailai. There is also a widespread rumor here that Yanggao has been recovered. The Jining Peace Briefing issued a special edition.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Banner Restoration Work is Gradually Underway</h3>

Regarding air defense equipment, in addition to some of the original equipment at the rear having arrived, some of the equipment received from the enemy and puppets can also be applied.

However, he will remain in the United States for several weeks before returning home to tour various places for rest and recuperation. According to Zhang's friends, he will be discharged from the hospital soon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Plans to Adjust Highway Passenger Transport Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Due to the severe losses in highway transportation in recent months, the communications authorities, although the government has allocated subsidies, which are only enough to make up for some of the losses, plan to adjust passenger transport fees on all routes starting from October 1st. It is heard that the proposal has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review, but it is generally believed that there may not be an increase in the short term. Currently, highway passenger transport fees are those set in January of this year, nearly nine months ago.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals Tojo and Others</h3>
<p>We May Request Extradition for Trial</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] According to an official involved in the trial of war criminals, if the results of the trials by the Far East Military Tribunal of important Japanese war criminals such as Hideki Tojo are not satisfactory to China, the government may request extradition for trial by Chinese military tribunals, but preparations have not yet been made to do so. China currently has eleven military tribunals trying war criminals, two of which are in the three northeastern provinces, one under the Northeast Headquarters and one organized by the Changchun Northeast Security Command.</p>
<h3>Forty-One Taiwanese to be Tried in Japan</h3>

<h3>At a Welcoming Banquet for Wei Daoming in Shenyang, Xiong and Du Discuss Recent Northeast Affairs, Xiong Shihui Says the Government Will Continue Receiving, Du Yuming Says People in Communist Areas Form Underground Armies</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 28th] At a joint cocktail party hosted by Shenyang authorities on the afternoon of the 27th to welcome Wei Daoming, Xiong Shihui told reporters that people in the Northeast's unrecovered areas eagerly await the government's reception. If there are no obstacles or difficulties, the reception will continue to fulfill the people's expectations. Dalian, Harbin, and Andong all have similar situations. When asked about the rumor that the Soviet Union will send troops to strengthen the defense of the China Chang Railway, Xiong said he had not heard of it. Du Yuming was then asked to comment on the current situation in the Northeast. He said that besides a small number of Communist troops causing trouble, the Northeast is generally calm. However, in various Communist areas, people who oppose the Communist troops' policies and destructive actions have formed underground armies, using weapons scattered by the former enemy and puppet forces to engage in resistance. It is heard that this spontaneous organization of the people numbers no less than 200,000. This spontaneous organization of people who love the government and are concerned with their own interests, and the people who express their views on right and wrong, will have a definite evaluation, no matter how the Communist Party fabricates things, it is difficult to cover everyone's eyes and ears. In other news, Mayor Dong Wenqi of Xiaoxiao said that the Shenyang power line has been cut off for three days. The investigation revealed that the disruption was caused by an obstacle in the project near Qingyuan in the Communist area. People have been sent to Qingyuan to negotiate with the Communist troops to facilitate repairs, which are expected to be completed in three or four days.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Commercial Treaty Finalized; Currently Under Review, Signing Expected Soon; British Trade Mission Departs London for China Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The Sino-American commercial treaty, under negotiation since April of this year, has reached a mature stage. During the negotiations, the Chinese side was represented by Li Gan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme Economic Council, and Wang Cheng, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The newly appointed Papal Nuncio to China and the Legislative Yuan’s economic representatives also provided input on important matters. The initial draft of the commercial treaty has been thoroughly studied and finalized in recent days. It is currently being reviewed by Minister Wang Shijie and is expected to be approved within the week. The signing date is also expected to be set soon, and a signing ceremony and reception will be held. It is understood that the Sino-American negotiations began earliest and will result in the first formal commercial treaty China signs with a foreign country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is taking this very seriously. It is reported that the Sino-British and Sino-French commercial treaties will use the Sino-American treaty as a blueprint for future negotiations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The British Board of Trade officially announced that the British Trade Mission to China, consisting of nine members and three secretaries, will depart England for China on the morning of the 30th.

<h3>Northeast China's Treasure Trove Surpasses East Asia; Intensive Development Cannot Be Delayed; Interview with Wang Wenwei, Special Commissioner of the Central Bank in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] "The Northeast is a treasure trove of East Asia, with unlimited resources. The region's factories account for nearly 80% of the national total. Although they have been looted and damaged, many of the original facilities are still substantial. There is the Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Plant in Yongji and the Yalu River Hydroelectric Plant, whose power can be used for the development of agriculture and industry. In addition, low wages and few labor disputes make it a breeding ground for entrepreneurs across the country. If we devote the nation's manpower and resources, eliminate local past concepts, and accelerate development and the recovery of factories, the future of production and the prospects for international trade will be immeasurable. In this way, goods will flow smoothly, and legal tender will return to circulation, which can curb inflation." These were the opening remarks of Wang Wenwei, the newly arrived Special Commissioner of the Central Bank in the Northeast, when asked by a Central News Agency reporter about the current economic situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>Regarding the Central Bank's establishment of a financial network, Wang stated that the Central Bank has already established branches in Shenyang, Changchun, Siping, Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, and Jilin. Branches in Yingkou and Chengde are also in preparation. Now that trade between inside and outside the customs has opened, commercial and industrial remittances should be opened immediately. As for the exchange rate, according to the Central Bank's announcement, the exchange rate for remittances to Tianjin is 11.5 yuan per unit, and the exchange rate for remittances from Tianjin is 12.5 yuan per unit. The rate will be adjusted at any time according to the Central Bank's posted rate. Regarding Red Army currency, within the recovered areas, 2 billion yuan of 100-yuan notes have been redeemed. Small notes are only being collected and not released. The issuance of circulating currency is intended to prevent the devaluation of the people's funds (referring to Manchukuo currency). It is stipulated to be calculated at a 1:1 ratio. After the recovery of various regions, another price will be sought based on the prices of various goods within the customs, according to the value of legal tender, and then it will be recovered. The difficulties are numerous. For the time being, it will be based on the price index within the customs at that time, at a ratio of 1:13. It was originally intended to be adjusted according to the rise and fall of the index, but the authorities retained it out of consideration for the salaries of military police and civil servants.</p>
<p>Gold Price</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the price of gold in the Northeast, Wang stated that the price fluctuations there are based on Tianjin and Beijing as the standard. When he left Shenyang, the price of gold was around 300,000 yuan per tael. At first glance, the price difference from within the customs is very large. In fact, the local measurement system has not yet been unified, and the old system of 8 mace and 6 fen per 10,000 units is still used. In various parts of the Northeast, gold shops are an emerging industry, but they must first be approved by the committee before they can operate. During the Manchukuo era, gold was state-owned, and women's ornaments were also prohibited. Now, gold shops operate with decorative items as their target. The gold content is not based on the 99% or 98% deduction system but is based on the quality of the brand-name silver shop's stamp.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 28th] The Rehe Bank has received 50 million yuan (circulating currency) from the Central Government and will open soon. It will focus on regulating finance and promoting local commercial recovery. It is also reported that the Agricultural Bank of China and the Farmers Bank of China will also open here soon.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Northeast Takeover is Much Better than in the Interior</h3>
<p>Qian Gonglai Discusses the Investigation Process</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Qian Gonglai, head of the Northeast Takeover Investigation Team, who returned to Beiping from Shenyang on the 28th, told reporters about the investigation situation in the Northeast: "Our team spent a total of 50 days in the Northeast, visiting Shenyang, Yingkou, Anshan, Fushun, Yuanyang, Changchun, and Yongji. On the way back, we also inspected Jinzhou. We received more than 250 letters of denunciation. The takeover situation in the Northeast is simpler than in the interior. Although many cases of corruption have been found, there are also some that are in relatively good condition. All units in the interior have original takeover inventories, but the Northeast has many takings based on existing resources because of the special circumstances."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Jing Qingcha, Wei Fuyu, Zhu Cangzhou, and others went to Zhenjiang and Wuxi on the 29th to investigate. The results of the investigation in Nanjing have not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>Cargo Transport Between Inside and Outside the Customs to Simplify Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The establishment of a cargo transport office between inside and outside the customs is very important for the exchange of goods and the restoration of the economy. However, because all goods must be transferred at Shanhaiguan, the procedures are cumbersome, and the costs are high. At the same time, it is also prone to corruption. It is reported that the relevant authorities have decided that cargo transport will be changed to direct transport from October 1st.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Daily Necessities in Beiping and Tianjin Sold for 24 Billion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] The Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Area Daily Necessities Disposal Committee sold confiscated daily necessities from enemy and puppet property, generating a total revenue of over 24,097,900,000 yuan from March to the end of August this year.</p>
<h3>The Work of Repatriating Captives in the Northeast is Coming to an End; The Performing Arts Troupe's Final Departure from Shenyang Expresses Reluctance</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The work of repatriating enemy nationals and captives in the Northeast has reached its final stage. The American transport ships were originally scheduled to stop transporting at the end of September, but because the enemy nationals and captives in the Communist-controlled areas arrived at the port later, it is feared that it will have to be extended to mid-to-late October. Currently, there are approximately 280,000 to 290,000 Japanese nationals and captives concentrated and awaiting transport in Jinzhou, Huludao, and other places. Shenyang will make the final batch of shipments. Among them is an art troupe organized by a certain military agency. The troupe has more than 30 Japanese male and female music and dance stars, originally prepared to perform and dance at various celebrations as entertainment. In addition to showing their skills at gatherings, they mostly sold tickets at the Jianguo Hall to make a living. Their sweet singing and flying legs have captivated countless people over the past two months. However, the good times will not last long, and the troupe must leave Shenyang soon. Therefore, they are giving a farewell commemorative performance. The 29th is the last day. The Japanese women wear fashionable Chinese costumes, singing "Roses Everywhere" and "When Will You Return," while also posting slogans such as "Goodbye, Shenyang." This kind of performing arts group with a thousand emotions is now the rearguard of the final stage of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast. The enemy opened the stage with iron hooves and closed the curtain with beauty, song, and dance. It can be said to be a commemorative story worth writing about, and it is also full of profound meaning.</p>
<h3>Aluminum Ore Exploration in the Fujian-Taiwan Area; Hu Wenhu Plans to Establish a Fujian Construction Company</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Mineral exploration is being actively carried out in various regions of South China, with aluminum ore as one of the main focuses. Fujian and Taiwan are the central areas for exploration and development, which is closely related to the establishment of our aviation industry. It is also reported that once transportation and order in the Northeast are relatively stable, the authorities will organize a large-scale exploration team to develop the Northeast's rich resources.</p>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 28th] Hu Wenhu recently returned here from China and is now planning to establish a Fujian Construction Company with a capital of £300,000 to develop Fujian Province's railways, highways, coal mines, steel mills, iron ore mines, and power plants. Hu himself is prepared to invest approximately £50,000, with the remaining capital to be invested half by Fujianese overseas Chinese in the Malay Peninsula and the other half by Fujianese overseas Chinese in Burma, Siam, and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Senator Li Runshen Found Guilty of Corruption During the Takeover</h3>
<p>The Provincial Senate Guarantees the Surrender of the Perpetrator</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 29th] The last person found guilty by the Shandong-Henan Investigation Team before its conclusion was Li Runshen, the former manager of the Jinan Electric Power Company, for corruption during the takeover. Li Dingshuchen is currently the chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce, a Shandong Provincial Senator, and a representative to the National Assembly. During the takeover, he used his position to collude with the Japanese to steal and sell 600 tons of coal and over 600 rolls of military-use iron wire, 3 tons of steel rails, 12 wheels, 300 cotton quilts, over 20 boxes of porcelain teapots, and 54 barrels of grease, and concealed 600 bags of flour. After the team investigated and confirmed the evidence, it intended to transfer the suspect to the court. However, it was during the session of the Provincial Senate, and it was inconvenient to arrest him. Unexpectedly, the suspect took the opportunity to escape. Later, the Senate issued a guarantee to ensure that he would be brought to justice within 24 hours of the end of the session. The team then transferred the relevant documents to the District Prosecutor's Office on the afternoon of the 28th.</p>
<h3>Former Prime Minister of Siam to Visit China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 28th] According to local newspapers, former Prime Minister of Siam, Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena, may travel abroad next month, first to China and then to Europe and the United States.</p>
<h3>Demarcation of the Jiangyin Fortress Area; The Scope is Larger than Before the War</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Communication] The Ministry of National Defense is actively rebuilding the Jiangyin Fortress, and the area is larger than before the war. It has now been demarcated, including Goose Mountain, East Mountain, Huangshan Mountain, Xiaoshan Mountain, Changshan Mountain, Wushan Mountain, etc. The outer periphery extends from Wujin East Township in the west to Changshu Fushan in the east, from Jingjiang Liuyi Port to Tianshen in Jiangbei, and from Langshan along the river in the south. All of these are included in the fortress area. Commander Kong has sent personnel to survey the entire fortress terrain separately for planning and construction. Also, because the Yangtze River is also within the fortress area, the current state of river defense is important, so ship registration is being carried out. Riverbank fishing households must also be investigated. When necessary, fishing boats will be prohibited from fishing in the fortress area. Residents living on land in the fortress area will undergo household registration and be issued resident certificates for identification.</p>
<h3>Landlord Beats Tenant Farmer to Death in Longdengchang, Hanyang</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 29th] A case occurred in Longdengchang, Hanyang, the day before yesterday in which a landlord used his power to beat a tenant farmer to death. Tenants of the Sichuan Guild Hall in Hankou requested a reduction in last year's rent and requested that this year's rent be paid at market price. The guild rejected the demand, causing a dispute. Yin Fu, the director of the guild (currently the Director of the Hubei Provincial Food and Grain Department), then instigated Director Tang Xiaoyi to personally lead eight armed soldiers to search the tenant's home. The tenant protested, and a soldier kicked Yang Kaiwen's abdomen, severely injuring his scrotum, causing his immediate death. In addition to reporting the death to the court for an autopsy, the tenant farmer's family also appealed to all quarters for assistance.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 American Missionaries Departed from the United States Yesterday by Ship for China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 28th] More than 400 Protestant missionaries will sail tomorrow on the American President Lines ship General Meigs to China and the Philippines. The missionaries represent 23 denominations.</p>
<h3>Silk Mill Strike in Wuxi Escalates; Rongshen Mill Destroyed by Female Workers; County Magistrate Xu Orders All Workers to Return to Work Today</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 29th] The second wave of strikes in silk mills throughout the county has escalated. No work has resumed today. The Rongshen Silk Mill in the south gate was destroyed by female workers, who cut the silk and damaged the staff. According to reports, County Magistrate Xu stated that some workers in silk mills such as the Jiatei Silk Mill in the east gate were incited by malicious elements and engaged in disruptive behavior. He specifically issued a handwritten order to the silk reeling industry union to inform all factory workers that they must all return to work starting on the 30th. At 2:00 PM, representatives from each factory were sent to the silk mill union for instruction. It was stated that any further illegal actions would be investigated and punished without leniency. At the same time, the capitalists also convened an extraordinary general meeting of all members. After discussion, it was resolved that due to the workers' repeated strikes, work would not resume until a guarantee method was obtained from the authorities.</p>
<h3>Fu Sinian Arrives in Nanjing from Beiping; Discusses this Year's Joint Entrance Examination; Southern Candidates' Results to be Announced in this Newspaper</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Fu Sinian arrived in Nanjing by plane from Beiping at 3:30 PM on the 29th. After arriving in Nanjing, Fu Sinian met with Central News Agency reporters at the Academia Sinica and said that the situation at Peking University was very good. The return of the professors from Kunming was particularly admirable. Under the leadership of President Hu Shi in the future, Peking University will definitely become a true academic institution. The school can accommodate 5,000 students in the second half of the year because too many young people have lost their education and must find ways to accommodate them in large numbers. This year's joint entrance examination for Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University showed that more candidates applied for engineering subjects, and the number of candidates applying for Peking University was limited. The admission standard this time was based on the sum of the scores in Chinese, English, and mathematics, with a total score of 80 or more being admitted. However, very few were admitted to Peking University. Later, Peking University and Tsinghua University stipulated that those with a total score of 70 in the three subjects could be admitted first. The second announcement was made in Beiping on the 28th. Those taking the examination in the south will have their results published in the Shanghai Shen Bao. All those who originally applied to Peking University will enter Peking University, and those who applied to Nankai University will enter Nankai University. Those who applied to Tsinghua will change to Peking University or Nankai University at their discretion because Tsinghua's quota is full. In terms of the level of the examination, Shanghai was the best, Chongqing was second, and Beiping and Guangzhou were the worst. The standard of students in Beiping used to be the highest in the country, but now it has plummeted, which is very painful.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Illusion of Fairbank's Thesis</h3>
<p>Mr. Fairbank, the former director of the Press Department of the U.S. Embassy in China, recently published an article in The Atlantic Monthly entitled "America's Opportunity in China," which reviews American policy toward China. It contains many irrelevant and superficial remarks that cannot be left uncorrected. During Fairbank's time in China, he recruited many communists and left-leaning people into the organization he headed. His views may therefore be biased, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>As far as Sino-American relations are concerned, our two peoples have always maintained friendly relations. The United States has spent a lot of money promoting religion, medicine, health, and education in China. China has also spent a lot of money sending many students across the ocean to study in the United States. In every level of society today, there are people who have received American education and occupy very important positions. As Mr. Fairbank said, "The China we know today is built by a large group of people who have used our (meaning American) experience." Especially during the War of Resistance, Sino-American relations became even closer, and cultural exchanges became even smoother. Logically, there should no longer be any barriers or misunderstandings between China and the United States. But unfortunately, Fairbank's thesis contains many misinterpretations of China. We are not so stubborn as to refuse to listen to a pertinent comment, but if foreigners comment on China's internal affairs with preconceived notions and force us to agree, they will inevitably have a superficial feeling. On the one hand, we should welcome Fairbank's sincere advice, but on the other hand, we do not want some self-proclaimed "China experts" who are actually "ignorant" to cause deeper estrangement between China and the United States. Therefore, we must express our views to correct the views of the Chinese and American people.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Fairbank places the responsibility for the failure to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference entirely on the right-wing of the Kuomintang. This view is obviously unfair. We do not need to completely deny that within the Kuomintang, such a large party, there may be differences of opinion, just as the Democratic Party in the United States also debates the government's foreign policy. This is not surprising. However, the policy of the Kuomintang is decided by the representative congress or the central plenary session. Once a decision is made, whether it is left or right, everyone obeys and cannot be blamed on the so-called right-wing. Moreover, these divisions of left and right are the Communist Party's attempts to divide the Kuomintang, and Fairbank has unintentionally been deceived and anesthetized. In fact, the most important key to the failure to fully implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference is that the Communist Party believes in the omnipotence of force and first destroyed the reorganization plan, established its so-called "Democratic Allied Army" in the Northeast, and prevented the National Army from entering the Northeast to restore sovereignty. At the same time, the Soviet Union moved out all of the Northeast's industrial equipment, arousing a patriotic and rights-protecting wave among the people of the country. This movement was entirely the automatic action of patriotic people and could not be instigated by the right-wing elements of the Kuomintang. Comparing this natural patriotic movement with the anti-American movement currently promoted by the Communist Party, unbiased American friends should be able to understand which is the true public opinion. And the facts can prove that the Kuomintang not only does not want to destroy the agreement jointly agreed upon by all parties in the country but still hopes to implement it. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly delivered speeches, all of which emphasize the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and urge the Communist Party and other parties to elect representatives to the National Assembly and members of the National Government, which is not just once, and has ordered a ceasefire several times. It can be seen that the government's "political democratization" has long been moving towards the goal, and it has already begun to implement the "nationalization of the army" by reducing the size of the army. However, the Communist Party is neither willing to unify its troops according to the plan nor willing to participate in the National Assembly or the National Government. Therefore, it is clear who is responsible for obstructing the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Fairbank observes the Chinese people with a capitalist eye, believing that what the Chinese people urgently need is economic democracy, not political democracy. He said, "A person only thinks about freedom of speech after he has eaten his fill." He also said, "We find that they (the Communists) are the most effective advocates of protecting the economic welfare of farmers. Because they can help farmers obtain their economic needs, they can obtain the political support of the farmers." We completely disagree with this statement because we believe that political democracy (the Principle of Democracy) and economic democracy (the Principle of People's Livelihood) are two sides of the same coin and cannot be separated. In addition to these two kinds of democracy, there is also national democracy (that is, nationalism), which is also an essential meaning that cannot be ignored. The reason why we resisted for eight years, persevering and unyielding, was because of this spirit. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, first created the Three Principles of the People, which emphasized these three kinds of democracy at the same time and consistently. The reason for this is also here. At the same time, can the Communist Party's "political capital" really seek welfare for farmers? It can also be evidenced by the clear facts. According to the actual situation in the Communist-occupied areas of northern Jiangsu, the Communist Party only knows how to destroy, but does not know how to build, and has killed, burned, and looted the entire northern Jiangsu, making the general farmers willing to become pitiful and helpless refugees, wandering in other places, rather than staying in their hometowns to be the meat on the Communist Party's chopping board, allowing them to slaughter them. The millions of refugees from northern Jiangsu crowding the Shanghai and Nanjing area are an undeniable ironclad proof. As for the politics of Yan'an, in the past, it closed the door and acted as a theatrical director, which may have deceived some foreigners, but over time, it has become widely known that there is absolutely no democracy. American female reporter Anna Louise Strong recently wrote to The New York Times, also saying that there is no democratic atmosphere in Yan'an. We do not know how Mr. Fairbank can defend the Communist Party?</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Fairbank points out that the Kuomintang after Chiang took office has become a conservative party. The reasons he bases this on are threefold: 　The same few figures always occupy important positions in the government; 　There is no plan to improve the lives of farmers; 　The government is in collusion with large landowners and financial manipulators and is afraid of revolution. These words are truly "false in words and plausible in argument," seemingly right but actually wrong. Today, the Kuomintang has become a vast composite, and the Three Principles of the People have become the catchphrase of the whole country. There may inevitably be a small number of stragglers in the Kuomintang, but what party can avoid a small number of stragglers? Otherwise, why did the Soviet Union need to purge the party? Therefore, from a broad perspective, the Kuomintang is still a progressive revolutionary party, which not only has the Three Principles of the People that are suitable for the national conditions and are unanimously believed by the people of the country but also has a glorious history, and leading the War of Resistance has even more brilliant achievements. As long as there is no external obstruction and it is allowed to preside over the country's administration and seek progress in stability, there is no problem in gradually implementing the Three Principles of the People and improving the lives of the general public. Moreover, the general enlightened party members have long launched a party-government reform movement, and regardless of how difficult the current environment is, they are still overcoming all difficulties and approaching the people every day. The establishment of local public opinion organs makes stern criticisms of the government in general, and the central authorities are also planning the implementation plan for rural land reform and the large-scale promotion of the cooperative system. All of these show that the Kuomintang is always moving in the direction of progress. However, the progress that the Kuomintang requires is to be sought in stabilizing social order. The Communist Party, however, disregards everything and destroys order before talking about anything else. May I ask, which one do we want? What Mr. Fairbank calls "conservative," I don't know what he is referring to. If seeking progress in stability is considered conservative, then may I ask Mr. Fairbank, are today's American Truman government and the British Labour government also considered conservative governments? And is it necessary to learn from the Soviet Union's great revolution of 1917 to be considered a progressive government?</p>
<p>Finally, we must state one point: Mr. Fairbank, in the United States, which has freedom of speech, is free to express his political views on American policy toward China, which is commonplace and not worth paying attention to. However, Mr. Fairbank did not spend a short time in China and was responsible for communicating the opinions of the Chinese and American people. Now, he has published this kind of "obviously unfair" speech, which we cannot but regret. We are reminded that Wallace once visited China as Vice President and, after returning to China, reported his impressions, meaning that the National Government in Chongqing at that time would soon collapse economically, and even politically. This observation even made President Roosevelt feel bewildered for a time. Thinking about it now, a cursory glance is certainly not seeing the truth, and a superficial scratch is inevitably unrealistic. We always feel that there is a common flaw in the comments of American leftists on Chinese politics, that is, their prejudices are too deep, and they insist on measuring the politics of other countries with their own standards. Compared with the observations of legal scholar Pound, they cannot be compared. It is necessary to know that the development and evolution of the politics of various countries have their own certain trajectories, and the traditional social environment is an even more decisive factor. If foreign commentators cannot face reality and blindly base their views on their already formed ideology, then what they see will inevitably lead to illusions. We can ignore Fairbank's illusion alone, but we cannot let him cause estrangement between China and the United States.</p>

<h3>Turkey's Determination to Defend Sovereignty: Unwavering Stance on Rejecting Soviet Co-Management of Straits</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 28th] Regarding the Turkish Straits issue, the Soviet Union on the 24th of this month once again issued a note to the Turkish government, insisting on the need for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Dardanelles Strait.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Istanbul, 28th] According to highly reliable sources today, "extraordinary events may occur." Turkish troops are ready and prepared to respond. This observation stems from Moscow Radio's broad assertion that the Soviet Union is seeking a new treaty among Black Sea nations for the joint defense of the Dardanelles Strait. The Turkish government has become very pessimistic in recent days, with a sense that a storm is brewing. However, Turkey is prepared for any eventuality. Frankly speaking, Turkey is determined to defend its sovereignty, and if attacked, it can start fighting within five minutes. According to Moscow Radio broadcasts, the Soviet Union issued a note to Turkey on September 24, insisting on revising the Montreux Convention, jointly managing the Dardanelles Strait, and warning Turkey not to collude with non-Black Sea countries in military actions. This second demand was not known to the outside world until Moscow Radio broadcast it. Turkish officials have not yet made any formal statement on this.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 28th] The Foreign Office has declared that the British government still adheres to the principles of the Montreux Convention and does not agree with the views expressed by Moscow Radio this morning regarding the Straits issue. According to this view, the Montreux Convention will be replaced by the Potsdam Agreement. In short, we believe that the Montreux Convention cannot be amended without the consent of the signatory states and the United States.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Demands Internationalization of Ruhr, Accuses Britain and the United States of Violating the Potsdam Agreement</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 29th] A Moscow Radio broadcast statement accused Britain and the United States of violating the Potsdam Agreement. It stated briefly that the fundamental goal of the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany is to democratize and disarm Germany to prevent any new German aggression. In this regard, it is necessary to ensure that the Potsdam Agreement is implemented in all German occupation zones. The Soviet Union's demand to place the Ruhr industrial area (currently occupied by British forces) under international control is precisely for this reason, as the Ruhr industrial area is the foundation of German militarism. This principle has not been accepted by other occupying powers, so the Soviet Union cannot be solely blamed if it does not implement it. All military organizations in the Soviet occupation zone have been disbanded, all Nazis and Fascists have been expelled from administrative organs, and no factories can be used for military purposes. Conversely, other occupation zones cannot do the same, which is unfortunate. Britain and the United States are attempting to establish a "Western Bloc" or "United States of Europe," aiming to overthrow the Potsdam Agreement, which is a necessary guarantee for peace and cannot be overturned.</p>
<h3>Churchill and Daughter Return to England</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 29th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill arrived here yesterday from Beijing and took a morning flight back to London today with his daughter Mary.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Control Divided into Three Stages: Technical Team Drafts Plan</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Lake Success, New York, 28th] The technical subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission has drafted an international atomic energy control plan and submitted it to the committee for discussion this morning. The plan is divided into three stages: (1) control of atomic energy ore mining; (2) control of refining uranium from ore; (3) control of atomic energy refining in industry. In the first stage, control is easier because the scope of the mining enterprises involved is small. However, in the third stage, controlling the smelting of ore is more difficult. When smelting ore, it is necessary to set a limit for natural losses, otherwise, fraud is inevitable. The greatest difficulty lies in the third stage, as various equipment for radiating atomic energy can be slightly modified to switch from peacetime use to wartime use in a very short time.</p>
<h3>Britain Launches UN Week, Urges People to Value the UN Organization, and Eliminate International Suspicion Through Knowledge and Reason</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th] King George of England, Prime Minister Attlee, Churchill, and many other leaders in the United States have sent congratulatory messages to wish the United Nations Association of Great Britain success in hosting United Nations Week, which begins tomorrow and lasts until the 6th of next month. During United Nations Week, which begins tomorrow throughout England, special prayers will be held in churches, and there will be torchlight parades, mass demonstrations, concerts, and various exhibitions to promote public awareness and support for the United Nations organization. This movement is jointly organized by 500 branches of the United Nations Association of Great Britain, and its stated goal is to "eliminate mutual suspicion among nations through knowledge and reason, and the free exchange of ideas and opinions."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Britain will begin holding United Nations Week tomorrow. Prime Minister Attlee issued a statement stating that the government has repeatedly stated its emphasis on the United Nations organization. If all countries can view the United Nations Charter as a system for developing their national goals to serve all of humanity, it will not be difficult to bring peace and happiness to the world. Foreign Minister Bevin also said that the world still needs to learn more about the relationship between national and international interests.</p>
<h3>Indian Representative in Paris Meets with Molotov</h3>
<p>Expresses Friendship with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 29th Radio: Indian Provisional Government Representative Menon met with Molotov in Paris yesterday and flew to London today. It is said that the meeting was fruitful and expressed India's willingness to be friendly with all countries in the world, including the Soviet Union. Menon solemnly stated that the Indian government's foreign policy has no intention of being "partial."</p>
<h3>Truman Delivers Speech, Reaffirms Belief in Peace: Mao Youtao and Others Advocate a Summit of the Big Three</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 29th, United Press] President Truman, while attending the West Point football game yesterday, told the students and staff of the school that he believed that "permanent peace" could be achieved after the war. Marshal Marshall is the highest example of a soldier, and he is engaged in the most important work for the country in peacetime. After Stalin stated his belief in peace, Truman reaffirmed his same belief in peace today. He said, "We firmly believe that there will be lasting peace, and peace is the goal of our work."</p>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 28th] Former Roosevelt cabinet members Ickes and Mao Youtao, in a speech at the 31-state Liberal Party meeting, called on President Truman to hold a meeting with Attlee and Stalin to quickly end the astonishing war negotiations.</p>
<h3>New Rebellion in the Philippines: 5,000 Radicals Issue Anti-Government Declaration</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 29th] A rebellion broke out today in Laguna Province, north of Manila. A small group of Filipinos issued a declaration advocating the overthrow of President Roxas and his government. Laguna Province Governor Panchian reported that the group were all "radicals," totaling 5,000 people, calling themselves "National Guards," threatening to execute him. He expects the military police to be able to "deal with the rebellion." He has received a letter from the organization stating that its purpose is to overthrow the Roxas government, which is "controlled by American imperialists and foreign fascists." Panchian said that the movement is mostly composed of guerrillas dissatisfied with the government, and their activities have so far been limited to occasional attacks on isolated villages.</p>
<h3>Greek Prime Minister Forms New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Athens, 28th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris recently met with the King and tendered the resignation of the cabinet. The King then ordered him to form a new cabinet.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Issues Amnesty Decree</h3>
<p>[TASS, Sofia, 28th] The Presidium of the Bulgarian Parliament, which is temporarily acting as head of state, issued an order reducing the sentences of prisoners of all levels. Nine different types of sentences have been ordered to be pardoned. Those sentenced to more than five years for violating people's customs, national defense laws, or taking advantage of opportunities for profit are not eligible for amnesty. A total of 2,462 criminals were pardoned, including 1,662 political prisoners and 800 other criminals.</p>
<h3>King Downgraded to Commoner: Grandfather and Grandson Share the Same Fate</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Alexandria, 29th] Bulgarian King Simeon, who was forced to abdicate, and the Queen Mother arrived here today from Istanbul as refugees. The mother and son were dressed simply, and the authorities initially did not pay attention to them. They were welcomed by a representative of the Egyptian King upon arrival. The group then drove to Ras El-Tin Palace, where the first to greet them was Simeon's grandfather, former Egyptian King Ahmed Fuad, who embraced his grandson in a sorrowful reunion.</p>
<h3>Crimes Inescapable: Nazi War Criminal Entrusts Orphans</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Nuremberg, 28th] The trials of the 21 German war criminals in Nuremberg Prison have been completed and sentences will be announced soon, with most of them facing the death penalty. The court authorities, showing leniency, allowed each prisoner to meet with his wife for one hour on the 28th and 29th to entrust final words. Originally, only half an hour was allowed for the meeting.</p>
<h3>New French Constitution Draft</h3>
<p>Passed by the Constituent Assembly, to be put to a citizen vote next month.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 29th] The French Constituent Assembly today finally passed the full text of the new draft constitution by a vote of 440 to 106. This is the result of a compromise between the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement. The new constitution is scheduled for a referendum on the 13th of next month.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 29th Radio, Abbey Nor report: General de Gaulle declared here today that although he had criticized the draft constitution, he did not specifically ask the French people to reject it. He spoke in his personal capacity, not on behalf of the party.</p>
<h3>1919, 1946: A Comparison of the Two Paris Peace Conferences (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lu Yu</p>
<p>(5) Differences in Personnel</p>
<p>In comparing the personnel of the two Paris Peace Conferences, the following three points are worth noting: first, the charisma and skills of the leaders themselves; second, the cooperative relationship between the leaders; and third, the selection of the US delegation. The most important figures at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference were the well-known "Big Three"—US President Wilson, British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and French Prime Minister Clemenceau. These three, whether in terms of international prestige, domestic standing, or achievements, can be said to be the first-class politicians of the World War I era. In particular, President Wilson's idealism, Prime Minister George's diplomatic skills, and Prime Minister Clemenceau's patriotic enthusiasm were most praised. Looking back at the representatives of the major powers attending this conference, such as US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Minister Bevin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and French President Bidault, in terms of both prestige and domestic positions, they are far inferior to the "Big Three" of the previous conference. This fact makes today's conference less impressive. As I write this, I cannot help but feel a sense of desolation and regret the early death of the late President Roosevelt and the defeat of former Prime Minister Churchill. As for the cooperative relationship between the leaders, this conference is far less harmonious than the last conference. The reasons for this have been briefly mentioned above. In short, it is due to the tension between the East and West blocs, the severity of which far exceeds the opposition between the United States and France in the previous conference. Second, there is no leader on the international stage today with the lofty reputation of President Wilson in 1919. Byrnes, Bevin, and Molotov are all on par in terms of status, prestige, and achievements, and no one is likely to yield to the other. Third, both Bevin of Britain and Molotov of the Soviet Union are internationally known for their quick tempers and hotheads, and arguments between the two can easily become heated. This has a negative impact on the smooth progress of the conference. As for the selection of the US delegation to this conference, it is worth noting for the following reasons: The reason for President Wilson's failure last time was that when he went to Paris, he did not include any Republican officials in his entourage. Therefore, the US delegation at that time represented only the Democratic Party, not the entire United States. After President Wilson returned from overseas, the Treaty of Versailles was not accepted by the Senate, which was dominated by the Republican Party. As a result, President Wilson died with regret, and the United States failed to join the League of Nations. This time, President Truman, in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, in addition to sending Secretary of State Byrnes as the chief representative, also sent Democratic Party official Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Party official Senator Vandenberg as representatives to participate in the conference together. As such, the US delegation to this conference represents the entire country of the United States, not just the ruling Democratic Party. This is extremely important for the future ratification of the treaty by the US Senate.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, comparing the two Paris Peace Conferences, we can draw the following conclusions: First, the international situation as the background to the conference is far more tense and serious in 1946 than in 1919. Second, in terms of the conference's tasks, scope, and powers, this conference is subject to strict limitations. Third, in terms of the organizational structure of the conference, this conference is far simpler than the previous one. Fourth, as for the people attending the conference, the representatives of today's conference are far inferior to the "Big Three" of 26 years ago. Because of the above, the reader may get the impression that the future of this conference is full of darkness and there is no hope of success. Should we adopt such a pessimistic attitude? I say, no. Although various phenomena indicate that this conference is inferior to the previous one in terms of "geographical advantage" and "human harmony," there is one important fact about "timing" that we must not ignore. That is, the world today has entered the atomic age. If a third world war breaks out, the result will not be who wins and who loses, but mutual destruction. The responsible authorities of all countries gathered at the Paris Peace Conference today should embrace the principle of "only success is allowed, failure is not allowed," be tolerant and accommodating to each other, to promote the completion of the treaty and the establishment of peace. This is not only related to the welfare of the people of other countries, but also for the survival of their own compatriots and descendants. This is what I want to loudly appeal to the representatives of the conference after comparing the differences between the two conferences.</p>

<h3>Two-Route Renovation Plan, Seven Major and Minor Projects: Initial Plan to Start Repairing Roadbed for 100 Kilometers Tomorrow, Expand McGon Road Freight Station, Build Jiaxing Subway Platform</h3>
<p>The three-phase plan for the renovation of the two railways has been finalized. The first phase will officially begin tomorrow. This plan is divided into seven items: (1) Engineering improvement: repairing 100 kilometers of roadbed, rebuilding 12 road maintenance team houses, cleaning all ditches in the stations along the two routes, and building 30 railcars and hand-pushed flatcars each, and 57 single-wheel gravel carts. (2) Traffic construction: adding 40 pairs of inner station (i.e., inner flag) signals. (3) Improving order: adding 10,000 meters of sheds to stations along the two routes, rebuilding and repairing various stations. (4) Improving passenger transport facilities: building Jiaxing subway platforms, adding rain shelters to large and small stations along the two routes, 4,500 square meters. (5) Improving freight transport facilities: expanding the entire McGon Road Freight Station project. (6) Improving the machine section: converting the Hangzhou locomotive house into a passenger and freight car house, expanding the entire house project, and adding a water pool to the Shanghai North Station. (7) Expanding the Qishuyan Vehicle Factory: this project will be divided into four months from October 1st to the end of January next year. The second and third months will be used for re-examination. The budget for the above entire project is a total of 2.315 billion. The second phase of the plan will begin in early March next year, and will be purely for rebuilding traffic equipment, such as electrical signals. The third phase of the plan will be implemented in early October next year, which will be to re-examine all the projects in the first and second phases, and then make improvements and supplements. The entire plan is expected to be completed in early March of the 37th year. Director Chen Bozhuang of the Bureau took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train at 10 o'clock last night, carrying the three-phase renovation plan and the general budget to the Ministry for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Council Delegation to Petition in Beijing: "Cultivating Shanghai's Industry and Commerce is Like Gardeners Planting Flowers," Awaiting Pest Control, Irrigation, and Fertilization</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Councilors-organized petition delegation to Beijing, appealing to the government to improve the city's financial policies. It is reported that among the 11 members of the delegation, Xu Guomao and Luo Qinghua took the express train to Beijing yesterday, and Xu Jiyi plans to go to Beijing early this morning. Others such as Jin Runyang, Liu Jingji, Yang Fusheng, Yu Zuoting, Wang Yansong, Xi Yushu, Tao Baichuan, and Wang Xianqing plan to go to Beijing tonight. All members of the delegation are scheduled to gather at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in Nanjing at 9 am tomorrow, and then proceed to petition the government.</p>
<p>[Another Report] This reporter interviewed representative Yang Fusheng yesterday. According to him, this trip to Beijing to petition represents the expectations of the city's industry and commerce. The effect may not be certain, but he hopes that the government authorities will change their past erroneous views and no longer regard the city as a source of profit to be exploited. It should be known that the city's industry and commerce, whether in the past, present, or future, is undeniably the economic center of the country, like a rare flower. If it can be helped to grow and develop as much as possible, then bright and beautiful fruits will be able to spread their excellent seeds throughout the country, so that the entire national economy can be stabilized. Therefore, the central government should regard itself as a gardener, reversing the previous attitude of taking and using. Eliminating harsh and miscellaneous taxes, rectifying officials, that is the work of pest control. Loosening funds, adjusting tariffs, that is fertilization and irrigation. If the government does not think of the country and the nation and continues as before, with officials competing with the people for profit and the central government competing with the local governments for profit, and cutting down at every turn, not only will the city's economy decline, which can be counted on the days, but also there will be no hope for national construction. I know that the authorities may not know this unwise thing, then the result of this trip will definitely change the authorities' views, for the city and the country, considering the will of the people, no longer perfunctory, and at the same time hope that public opinion will consistently support, so that the delegation does not make this trip in vain.</p>
<h3>Investigation Team Ends Today, Unfinished Cases to be Handled in Beijing</h3>
<p>The reception work investigation team, previously based on a tip-off accusing the municipal government's receiving materials management office of corruption in bidding and falsely labeling 4 billion yuan worth of materials for the Central Market, had handed over all the files to the auditing office for review, which has not yet been completed. It is now learned that the team has decided to end the investigation work today. Regarding the thorough investigation of the case, if it cannot be completed today, it will be handled in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Changxing Coal Mine Needs to be Restored Urgently: Wang Xiaolai Returns to Shanghai to Talk</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wang Xiaolai went to Hangzhou on official business ten days ago and returned to Shanghai a few days ago. He told this reporter that the main task of this trip was to accompany the chief metallurgical engineer to survey the Changxing Coal Mine. According to reports, the coal reserves in this mine are very rich. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the war. After an investigation, it is estimated that if actively repaired, it will take at least one to five months to produce coal. If the regular coal production is restored, the fuel required for power in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places can be supplied continuously without worrying about shortage. In addition, regarding the Qiantang River ferry, a restoration committee will be established to plan and build pedestrian docks on both the north and south banks of the Qiantang River. In addition, he had handled the highway passenger transport affairs of Zhejiang Province on behalf of the Southeast Motor Company. Generally speaking, the highway passenger transport affairs previously handled by the Highway Bureau will be handled by the company in the future.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Bureau Opens Six Express Telegram Offices</h3>

The receiving address is still the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau General Business Office at 70 Fuzhou Road.</p>
<h3>Benefiting the Poor and Sick: Emergency Medical Loan Association, 21 Designated Hospitals, Starting to Receive Patients Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's Emergency Medical Loan Association, initiated by Gu Qianlin and others, was established in view of the fact that poor citizens often encounter urgent illnesses or unexpected events and need to be sent to hospitals for emergency treatment or surgery, but are often rejected by the hospital because they are unable to raise all the expenses in time, resulting in delays in life. Therefore, the association was specially organized, with Rong Hongyuan, Wang Tongyuan, Wang Qin Sun, Wu Zhongyi, Tang Xinghai, Xue Zuheng, Tang Shuming, Lu Jusen, and Gu Qianlin serving as executive directors.</p>
<p>Regarding the loan procedures, when a citizen encounters a disease or an accident, the patient can be sent to a nearby hospital designated by the association for emergency treatment. The hospital should provide emergency treatment to the patient upon receiving him, regardless of whether he can pay all or part of the medicine expenses. On the one hand, contact the patient's buyer in charge to handle the payment procedures. If assistance is indeed needed, the hospital will notify the association to guarantee payment. However, patients who obtain loans should repay the association as soon as possible after being treated, recovering, and safely discharged from the hospital, if their economic ability is sufficient to repay within a reasonable period of time, in order to benefit other patients. As for all investigation matters, the association will hire a number of visitors to be responsible at any time.</p>
<p>The association has now designated Zhongde Hospital, Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, Jardine Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Guangci Hospital, the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross, Tongren Hospital, Kemei Obstetrics Hospital, Deji Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, Dagong Hospital, Hongren Hospital, Sino-American Hospital, Labor Hospital, Southeast Hospital, and the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Municipal Hospitals, Municipal People's Hospital, and Municipal Obstetrics Hospital, a total of 21 hospitals, will start accepting patients with emergency medical loans from October 1st.</p>
<p>The loan fund is contributed by the directors, and Gu Qianlin is responsible for all administrative expenses. Donations from all walks of life are also welcome.</p>

<h3>After De Wu and Mi Jia were Imprisoned, Tai Xu Presided Over Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Abbot De Wu and supervisor Mi Jia of Jing'an Temple were accused of treason. After seven investigations by the High Court, they were detained and imprisoned. The temple affairs are now temporarily presided over by Master Tai Xu. In addition, deputy abbot Miao Ran, Bai Sheng of the Buddhist Association, and others are jointly responsible. It is said that the temple belongs to the lineage of the grandson jungle school (that is, the abbot passes on to his disciples). Before the court's verdict on De Wu, the position of abbot will not be changed for the time being.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenade from the Sky: The Entirety of Baxianfang Terrified</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Hu Zimei, a native of Anhui, runs the Hu Ziji Shen Zhuang at No. 30 Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, Zikai'er Road, specializing in transporting yarn and cloth for the Anqing gang. Yesterday, a little after 2:00 PM, Hu's wife was sitting idly in the side room when suddenly a loud crash was heard from the main room, shaking the entire neighborhood. Neighbors gathered to inquire and discovered a hole pierced through the floorboards of the mezzanine. Looking down at the floor, they found an iron hand grenade, shaped like a porcelain lightbulb, near the wall. Fortunately, no one was injured. Someone reported the incident to the Taishan Precinct, which dispatched police to investigate. The grenade fell from the sky, destroying three yellow roof tiles, penetrating the ceiling of the roof, the floorboards of the second floor, and the floorboards of the mezzanine before landing on the ground, also creating a hole in the floor. It is said that a minute before the incident, an airplane had passed overhead, so it is generally believed that the grenade may have fallen from the plane.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller's Black Heart: Flees with Millions in Funds; Envies the Owner's Business and Purchases Large Quantities of Cigarettes to Start His Own Business</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Rongxin, the owner of the Xin Da Tobacco Company at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road, instructed his apprentice, Yang Liangmin, to take a chartered rickshaw driven by Zhou Tingxiu, a native of Haimen, to deliver 10 million in legal tender to the Kunming Bank and 6 million to the Dunyu Money Exchange at around 4:00 PM on the 16th. They first arrived at the Dunyu Money Exchange, where Yang instructed the rickshaw puller, Zhou Tingxiu, to stop the rickshaw outside the door and told him to watch the 10 million on the rickshaw carefully. He then went inside to make the deposit. When he came out, Zhou Tingxiu had already fled with the rickshaw and its contents. Yang returned to the tobacco company and reported to the owner, Wang Rongxin, who sent people to search everywhere without success and then reported the theft to the Huangpu Precinct. Li Yinmin, the head of the Criminal Division, dispatched police to investigate. He also ordered officers Song Yuanshan and Yao Fuzhang, along with officer Ju Xingmei, to search along the Jinghu Railway line, but they were unable to find him. Later, they discovered that his father, Zhou Fengshan (54 years old), lived at No. 412 Zhaofuli, Binyou. They also found the chartered rickshaw from the Xin Da Tobacco Company parked under a building in Guojialou. They took Zhou Fengshan to the precinct for questioning, but he revealed nothing. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, Officer Li received a tip that Zhou Tingxiu had boarded a ship and was planning to go to Qinglong Port in Haimen. He immediately ordered officers to rush there and apprehend him. They found a new leather suitcase containing over one million in legal tender. During questioning at the precinct, Zhou confessed that he had used over three million in legal tender to purchase cigarettes, which he had stored in Qinglong Port. The precinct plans to dispatch officers within the next few days to escort the suspect to Qinglong Port to retrieve the stolen goods for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time: Ends Tonight; All Clocks Set Back One Hour</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] This year's daylight saving time, as ordered by the Supreme National Defense Council, will end at midnight tonight. After this, the original time will be restored, and clocks across the country will be set back one hour. The large clock on top of the Jianghai Customs Building in this city will also revert to the original time starting at midnight tonight.

<h3>Housing Rental Committee: Revised Draft Under Review</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Housing Rental Committee yesterday, the draft of the revised housing rental management regulations formulated by the committee has been approved by the municipal government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the National Defense Council. Once approved by the council, it will be implemented. It is said that the main feature of the draft is to strengthen the authority of the committee. Currently, the committee's authority is limited to mediation and it does not have the power to adjudicate. Mediation requires the consent of both parties. If it had the power to adjudicate, the resolution of cases would be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3>Living Expenses for Families of Traitors: Paid in Cash; Clothing Can Be Claimed</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Committee for the Management of Property of Traitors has begun to sell the property of major traitors in batches. Starting this month, the committee will conduct investigations and manage all properties of traitors in this city that have been judged by the High Court, and will tally the actual value of these properties for separate auctions. It is understood that the legally reserved living expenses for the families of traitors will be determined by the Ministry of Justice and Administrative Affairs and paid in cash, rather than distributed as property. Recently, the families of traitors who have been tried and sentenced have reported to the committee that their clothes have been confiscated and that they have no warm clothes for the upcoming cooler weather, requesting permission to have them returned. It is now known that the committee has decided that, except for the clothes of the traitors themselves, the clothing needed by their families can be unsealed and claimed as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Losses in the Yu Ying Pawnshop Robbery: Over 33 Million Yuan</h3>

Losses included nine rolls of wool fabric, 28 boxes of Morris cigarettes, and one radio, totaling 33,385,000 yuan, which is not as large as rumored.</p>
<h3>Revival of "Big Sister" Dance Hostesses: Bad Practices Gradually Becoming Obvious Again</h3>
<p>The "big sister" dance hostesses in the city's dance halls had largely disappeared after Director Xuan of the Municipal Police Bureau strictly prohibited them. However, these groups still wield considerable influence. All job-seeking dance hostesses are still under their control, so "big sister" dance hostesses continue to exist in the dance halls. The large ones manage five or six dancers, while smaller ones manage three or four. They have simply changed their titles to "managers" or "floor staff." If a customer wants to invite a certain dance hostess to sit with them, they must first sign a list and give it to the waiter, who gives it to the dance hostess's "big sister." The "big sister" then leads the dance hostess to the tea room, from where the waiter leads her to the customer. The practice of paying a fixed fee is also gradually re-emerging.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Military Officer to Transport Opium</h3>
<p>Huang Laosan, the kingpin of opium trafficking in North China, alias Cai Qing, 26 years old, from Beiping, impersonated a lieutenant colonel and deputy director of the Rear Service Headquarters. On September 1, he brought a large quantity of opium to Shanghai from Nanjing. He evaded inspection by military police at the North Railway Station by posing as a military officer. He hired a Xiang Sheng taxi to go to Yuandang Road. When the taxi reached the intersection of Beihai Road and Hubei Road, he was discovered by police officer Yu Rong, who confiscated a large quantity of opium on the spot. After strict questioning at the precinct, he confessed without hesitation. He was immediately handed over to the military law office of the garrison headquarters for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Jeeps, Big and Small, Dash About in Chaos: Pedestrians on the Road Fear for Their Lives</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Li Lianghai, 33 years old, from Changzhou, was passing the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road at 9:30 AM yesterday when he was hit by a jeep driven by Engineer Liu of the Ministry of Communications. Three fingers on his left hand were crushed on the spot, and both of his legs were seriously injured. The officer on duty immediately called for an ambulance, which took him to the Public Hospital for treatment. His condition is critical.</p>
<p>Xu Zha, a milk deliveryman for the Da Xin Milk Booth (a local resident, 26 years old), was riding his bicycle past the intersection of Pushe Road and Sacred Heart Road yesterday morning when he was suddenly run over by a truck from the Public Works Bureau.

<p>Zhang Meiying, a communications officer from the 8th Air Force Brigade in Dachang, was walking near the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop on Nanjing Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon when she was hit by a truck (license plate number 41252) driven by a Russian. She suffered a head injury and was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Jia Asi, 28 years old, from Xiashi, worked as a food delivery person for a catering service on Mankou Road.

<h3>UNRRA Ships to Sail Inland Rivers: Contract to Be Signed Within Days</h3>

<h3>City Councilors Touring the Sky: Looking Down at the Lower World from an Airplane; Height Obscures Crime and Disorder</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] Reflecting on the bleak past of China's aviation industry, one cannot help but feel that China's progress in aviation in recent years can be described as "leaps and bounds." This is, of course, a general statement. Compared to the civilized countries of Europe, the difference is too great. In the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, inviting the press to fly in the air has long become a historical relic. But in China, to this day, it still retains some of its appeal.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Mountain Country Airlines hosted the city councilors of this city for an aerial tour at Longhua Airport. The number of people who attended was unexpectedly crowded. In total, there were over 100 city councilors, over 60 City Council staff, and 100 members of the Aviation Construction Committee and guests. The company allocated two C47 transport aircraft, which flew in several batches, personally piloted by Chen Hongen, the director of the flight team.</p>
<p>The reporter waited from 8:30 AM until 11:30 AM before finally getting on the last flight. The weather was particularly good yesterday, and the temperature in the plane was also very normal. Having never flown before, I often heard people say how cold it was inside a plane, but yesterday, while circling in the air for a quarter of an hour, I never felt the slightest bit of cold. This was probably because we were flying particularly low. Our plane took off from Longhua Airport heading south, crossed the Huangpu River, turned east over Pudong, and reached Wusongkou and Chongming Island, before turning north back to the airport. Seeing Shanghai from the high altitude is more beautiful than ever! All the sins, turbidity, and disorder are obscured. Even Nanjing Road, which is usually the most chaotic in terms of traffic, felt lovely. As the plane crossed the racecourse, the four large characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" on the top of the International Hotel were clearly visible. However, fifteen minutes later, when I returned to this den of sin, I felt that it was still the sharpest satire.</p>
<p>"Sky Tours" can still give us a novel feeling today, even though in the past twenty years, we have had many airports, scheduled flights, and our own pilots. However, this is still not enough. As the United States has already completed the construction of a giant, ultra-heavy, ultra-high-altitude aircraft with eight engines, how should we be vigilant about our backwardness and catch up quickly!</p>

<h3>Port Affairs Reorganization Committee to Be Established Tomorrow: 21 Units Participating</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee, which was organized to solve various major difficulties in port affairs in this city, will be formally established tomorrow. The original organizations scheduled to join the committee included the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Naval Fleet Command, the Water Conservancy Commission, the Resources Commission, the Jianghai Customs, the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Property, UNRRA, the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, the Maritime Affairs Bureau, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Police Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, etc., for a total of seventeen organizations. Now, the National Leading Pilots Committee, the Shipping Guild, the Logistics Department, the First District Supply Command, and the Port Quarantine Station have also joined, bringing the total to twenty-one units. In the future, efforts will be concentrated and strengthened to eliminate theft at the docks, dredge the Huangpu River, and alleviate the congestion of docks and warehouses. This will play a significant role in promoting the city's foreign import and export trade.</p>
<h3>Girl Commits Suicide: Two Dead, One Alive</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, a young woman suddenly jumped off the roof of the Carlton Apartment, falling directly onto a passing pedicab, killing her instantly. It is reported that the deceased was wearing fashionable clothes, and the cause of her suicide and her name are being investigated by the police.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Jin Xingmei, a 17-year-old girl from Ningbo, lived with her mother at No. 107 Tongrenli, Tiantong Road. She attempted suicide by swallowing a gold ring last night at 7:00 PM due to a minor matter. Fortunately, her mother discovered her in time and rushed her to the Public Hospital for emergency treatment. She was out of danger by late at night.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Fan Zhenqin, a 29-year-old girl from Suzhou, lived at No. 70 Shunheli, Tiantong Road, North Jiangxi Road, Hongkou. Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM, she was scolded by her mother, Ms. Lu, due to a minor matter. In a fit of anger, she became despondent and secretly swallowed Lysol to commit suicide. Later, her family discovered her and rushed her to the hospital for treatment. However, because she had ingested too much poison, she died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The body has been sent to the coroner's office for examination pending verification.</p>
<h3>On the Wedding Night: Robbers Came to Die</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] On the night before last, Zhang Xiangsheng's home at No. 15 Deanli, Tongbei Road, was celebrating the wedding of his younger brother, Xiangfu. Guests filled the house, and the party continued late into the night. Suddenly, five robbers, each armed with guns, rushed into the house and forced the bride, groom, and guests to hand over all their valuables. While they were robbing, several courageous guests seized the opportunity to grab two of the robbers. At that moment, one of the robbers acting as a lookout fired his gun, and a bullet accidentally hit his accomplice in the left chest, who immediately fell to the ground. The captured robbers were eventually able to escape. The robbers were also panicked by this point and fled through the door. Patrol officers from the Garrison Headquarters Water Patrol happened to be passing by and, hearing the commotion, bravely stepped forward and apprehended the two robbers, seizing a six-inch pistol with twenty-five rounds of ammunition still in the chamber, as well as a wooden holster and five rounds of ammunition. The remaining robbers took the opportunity to escape. The captured robbers were taken to the precinct for questioning. One identified himself as Zhang Jinfa, a 29-year-old from Tianjin, residing at No. 26 Tongxingli, Kunming Road, Da Niwan Road. The other identified himself as Liu Yan, a 36-year-old from Hubei. The injured robber, named Peng Hui, was sent to the police hospital but died shortly after arriving due to the severity of his injuries. The remaining robbers are still being pursued.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Nurseries: YMCA Has a Long History; Children's Health Institute Is an Up-and-Coming Star; "Too Few Nurseries, Too Many Children" Still Needs Widespread Establishment</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] The slogan "Equality between men and women" has been shouted for who knows how many years, but have men and women truly become equal? There's no need to argue; just casually take the most fashionable city councilors as an example. Out of a total of one hundred and seventy-eight distinguished councilors, women only account for five, which is a ratio of thirty-five to one. This is just one example at hand; in fact, there are countless such examples in this country. Precisely because there are too many, no one finds it strange. Isn't that so? When have you ever heard someone ask, "Why is it that among the city councilors representing the people, only one out of thirty-five is female?"</p>
<p>Rather than scolding, "Women are the least ambitious," it is more practical and pertinent to say, "This society does not give women the opportunity to be ambitious." Leaving aside the current society's discrimination and exclusion of women, due to the underdevelopment of public services, women's "marriage and career" has formed a sharp contradiction. Marriage becomes a lifelong prison for women. However, people cannot violate nature after all; marriage is originally one of the major events in life. And difficulties also follow. Oil, salt, firewood, and vinegar are minor matters; raising children is a major matter. Handing over the chubby, healthy child to an illiterate nanny always feels unsettling. Thus, great maternal love calls a mother to sacrifice everything and raise her children wholeheartedly. Whatever talent and special skill she may have is all buried in the small circle of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's world where "nurseries" are not yet widespread, women have no future, and "equality between men and women" will forever be just a beautiful dream!</p>
<p>Speaking of nurseries in Shanghai, they are truly as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The one with the longest history is probably the one run by the YWCA. It is said that the results are not bad, but the scope is too small, and not many people benefit from it. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Children's Health Institute has also established nurseries to meet this need, temporarily limited to accepting infants aged three months to two years. Currently, public servants and business people account for the majority of the infants in foster care. Doctors, nurses, and other professionals are in charge of their care. The first location is at No. 10, Lane 173, North Sichuan Road, and the second location is at No. 7, Lane 24, North Haining Road. The most difficult problems currently faced by the institute are the issues of facilities and funding, because without spacious facilities and sufficient funding, it is difficult to achieve the ideal.</p>
<p>The cry for "establishing nurseries" may be deafening, but how much has been realized? It is reported that the women's community in this city has submitted a proposal to the City Council, requesting that a portion of the funds be allocated to establish nurseries. The City Council has also approved the allocation of a portion of the 900 million yuan in social relief funds as a special fund. It is hoped that this check can be cashed as soon as possible, and that "nurseries" can be established universally. This would be the gospel for all women and the fortune of the country. Conversely, if "nurseries" cannot develop, women will never have a chance to turn themselves around, to reiterate - China will never be rich and strong. Because no one can deny that the power of the two hundred million women who make up half of the total population is indispensable in the process of nation-building!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 28th] Representatives of the faculty and students of the National Northwest Institute of Technology recently stated that after the school moved to Shaanxi, the Ministry of Education promised to allocate 1 billion yuan for relocation expenses, but only 400 million yuan has been remitted so far. Both school buildings and funds are severely lacking, making it impossible to start classes. On the afternoon of the 28th, they held a press conference for the Xi'an press, making the following demands: (1) The Ministry of Education should promptly allocate 1 billion yuan for construction expenses. (2) The provincial authorities are requested to temporarily provide housing to alleviate the urgent need.</p>
<h3>Teaching and Research: Should Arithmetic Be Taught in the First Grade of Elementary School? Ministry of Education Orders National Education Association to Study</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Nanjing] After the establishment of the National Education Research Associations in various provinces and cities, meetings should be convened regularly in accordance with the General Outline of the Provincial and Municipal National Education Guidance Research Methods. National research issues are to be ordered and promulgated by the Ministry of Education at any time, and seven orders have already been issued. Now, the Ministry of Education has formulated the eighth set of four research questions, instructing the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities to send copies to their subordinate National Education Research Associations for thorough study and limit the submission of research results to the Ministry for review by the end of June 1947. It is learned that one of the four research questions in the eighth set is: "Should arithmetic be taught in the first grade of elementary school?" According to the original instructions from the Ministry of Education, elementary school teachers generally find it difficult to teach arithmetic in the lower grades. Some argue that arithmetic should be taught starting in the second and third grades, while others argue that not only should teaching not be postponed, but the level should be raised and the content increased. Should arithmetic be taught in the first grade of elementary school? Please conduct a detailed review and state the reasons to provide a reference for revising the curriculum standards.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Petitions the Executive Yuan to Maintain Student Public Funding, Extending it to Next Summer</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing News] Public funding for students in secondary and higher education institutions originated as a wartime relief measure and was originally intended to be discontinued. However, due to the current practical economic difficulties faced by the people, it is still necessary to continue its maintenance. The Ministry of Education has already petitioned the Executive Yuan to maintain student public funding and extend it for one year, until next summer. Publicly funded students in national schools are divided into two types: full public funding and half public funding. The quota for new students with full public funding and half public funding has been changed to 30% each (originally 40%). However, publicly funded students who are veterans resuming their studies are not subject to the 30% limitation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qiqian's Former Collection of Embroidered Items Transferred to the Central Museum</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping 29th Dispatch] Zhu Qiqian, who held important positions during the Beijing government era, formerly collected over eighty exquisite pieces of silk embroidery from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, which could be described as unparalleled within the country. Before the September 18th Incident, Zhu transferred all of these treasured embroidered items to the Palace Museum, but before they could be transported, the incident occurred, resulting in their confiscation by the Japanese invaders and designation as national treasures of the Puppet Manchukuo. Years ago, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Manchukuo's founding, the embroidered items were transported to the Tokyo Imperial Museum in Japan for exhibition, at which time they were insured for a huge sum of 10 million Japanese yen. Now, after investigation and recovery by the government, they have all been transported from the Northeast to this area and will be transferred to the Central Museum for reception and safekeeping, so that these rare cultural relics can be passed down for a long time.</p>

First, Principal Yu introduced the guests to the teachers and students of the school in a humorous tone. Then, Fu Tongxian, representing the guests, gave a speech, saying: "You students are extremely fortunate. Where does this fortune lie? There are three points: (1) a good principal, (2) good school buildings and facilities, and (3) good teachers. You should repay this kind of happiness. There are three ways to repay it: (1) be a model for millions of school children, be polite, observe order, and be reasonable, (2) mobilize out-of-school people to come to school, and (3) teach out-of-school people to read. If each of you more than two thousand students teaches one hundred people, then hundreds of thousands of people can be educated." Next, Huang Shijin spoke, and finally the students gave their thanks.</p>

<h3>The Performance Was Perfect, Sweeping the Heroes of Shanghai. The Qunsheng Team Crushed the Hualian Team Yesterday, With a Score of 66 to 45. The Hualian Team Was at a Loss. The Stadium Was Packed With Nearly 10,000 Fans.</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Qunsheng basketball team swept the heroes of Shanghai and was unexpectedly unstoppable. The Hualian team, the city champion, was also defeated miserably in a fierce battle last night, with a score of 66 to 45. In the first half, the visiting team took a ten-point lead with a score of 33 to 23. The Qunsheng team's performance was perfect, and the Hualian team was at a loss.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Spectacle</p>
<p>Nearly 10,000 fans rioted at the stadium last night. Pre-sale tickets were sold out in a quarter of an hour at 10:00 a.m. By 5:00 p.m., fans had already arrived in droves. By 6:30 p.m., the stadium was full, and thousands of people were denied entry. The gate was eventually broken down. The police station dispatched vehicles and opened the water supply to prevent accidents from happening. A large number of seats in the stadium were destroyed, and the order was extremely chaotic. Commander Xuan Tiewu entered the venue to watch and had to try every possible means. The spectacle far exceeded the National Games final, which is truly unprecedented. The Shanghai Radio Station broadcast the battle situation last night, which lasted until 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p>The More They Played, the Better They Got</p>
<p>The Qunsheng team played better and better. The ease of last night's victory was unexpected. The Hualian team appeared flustered and adopted a five-man zone defense. As a result, they were unable to attack and had loopholes everywhere in their defense. Their speed, shooting, and physical strength were all inferior, making it difficult to avoid defeat. Except for Wu Chengzhang, everyone else performed much worse than usual last night. After Li Zhenzhong was fouled out for the fifth time at 44 to 33 in the second half, Zhang Liangxiong replaced him, but there was still no development, and the entire army collapsed.</p>
<p>Unable to Resist</p>
<p>The referees were Liu Hesheng and Qu Honglu. The Qunsheng team's starting lineup was Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui. The Hualian team's starting lineup was Kong Guangyi, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, and Chen Xuesong. The game time was divided into two halves, which was the first change for the Qunsheng team in Shanghai. Wu Chengzhang of the Hualian team scored first, followed by Cai Wenhua of Qunsheng. Yang Renhui committed a foul, and Xuesong made a free throw. Hualian led by three to two. After three to one, the Qunsheng team led all the way, becoming seven to four, ten to six. Hualian called a timeout, but it was still difficult to kill their momentum. The Jinde and Jinzhi brothers of the Qunsheng team scored repeatedly, making it 29 to 18, a difference of eleven points. At the end of the first half, the score was 33 to 23, with the visiting team leading. At the start of the second half, there were no changes in the lineups of both sides. Cai Wenhua sneaked into the basket and scored first. The Hualian team still did not improve, and the score difference was always around ten points. Zhenzhong was fouled out for the fifth time, and Zhang Liangxiong replaced him. The score was 42 to 31. Zhang Liangxiong came on and made a long shot, but Jinde and Wenzhang made quick shots, accumulating points. At 54 to 37, the score difference widened. Jinde scored, making it 63 to 39, forming a situation of disparity. When the bell rang, the score was 66 to 45.</p>
<p>Qunsheng Fouls: Chen Jinzhi 0, 23 Cai Wenzhang 4, 8 Chen Jinde 15, 1 Cai Wenhua 3, 20 Yang Renhui 2, 0 Total 16, 66</p>
<p>Hualian Fouls: Chen Xuesong 2, 6 Li Zhenzhong 5, 0 Zhang Liangxiong 1, 8 Wu Chengzhang 0, 11 Bao Songyuan 2, 6 Kong Guangyi 2, 4 Total 13, 45</p>
<p>Also, according to the Basketball Association, the number of tickets sold was 2,000 downstairs and 1,000 upstairs for pre-sale, and 590,000 for temporary tickets, for a total of 1,259 million yuan. It is also known that the second game between Qunsheng and Hualian is scheduled to be held this Saturday (October 5th).</p>

<h3>Improving Yarn Allocation Methods, Intending to Include Cotton Cloth. The Allocation Price Adopts an Active Approach, Not Following the Black Market. The Textile Management Committee Carefully Drafts the Plan.</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Business Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held a meeting at 11:00 a.m. yesterday at the office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui on Jiangxi Road. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Vice Minister Pan, Zhang Zi, Liu Wenteng, Wang Zijian, Shu Zhang, Wu Wei Jing, Li Shengbo, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and others attended. During the meeting, Minister Wang and the persons in charge of various private yarn factories exchanged very detailed opinions on suppressing the market price of yarn and cloth and strengthening the distribution mechanism. Finally, it was decided that in order to fully suppress the price of yarn and cloth, the existing joint distribution mechanism of national and private yarn factories would be expanded. In addition to distributing cotton yarn, it would also consider distributing cotton cloth. The distribution price will never follow the rising prices of the black market, and efforts will be made to take the initiative and lead the black market price of yarn and cloth to fall. It is expected that after the expansion of the joint distribution mechanism, its constituent members will inevitably include the textile and dyeing industries, so as to take uniform steps to combat the crazy soaring prices of black market yarn and cloth. The entire plan will be submitted to the Textile Business Management Committee for planning.</p>
<p>Minister Wang returned to Beijing by evening train at 10:00 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>The Valuation Problem of Twenty-One Factories Has Not Been Completely Resolved</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs allocated twenty-one enemy and puppet factories as preferential purchases for industrialists in the rear, but the industrialists in the rear were still not satisfied with the valuation problem. The valuation standard of the Evaluation Committee was calculated based on 40% to 80% of the price of new American goods, but the purchasers believed that this type of industrial machinery and equipment was only 10% to 30% of the price of American goods. Therefore, it was suggested that the Processing Bureau, the China Trust Bureau, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs convene a joint meeting to discuss the valuation problem and unify the work of the various competent authorities. However, the Processing Bureau believed that it was not necessary to do so. Therefore, after many efforts to make contact, the joint meeting failed. Now, after several discussions, the industrialists in the rear have decided on four steps: (1) The industrial circles in the rear will estimate a unit for the factories they handle based on actual statistical materials and submit it to the Processing Bureau after discussion. (2) Since the purpose of these factories is to give preferential treatment to the industrialists in the rear who have made contributions to the war of resistance, two or three factories can be extracted for public auction to see whether the price set by the Processing Bureau can be accepted and what the highest bid price is, and how much difference there is from the evaluation, so as to show the reality of preferential treatment. (3) If necessary, they will go to Nanjing to explain the situation to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, ask for instructions, and request that the joint meeting be convened again to discuss various matters in the long term. (4) If all the suggestions are not adopted, they can only give up this preferential right.</p>
<h3>The Importers and Exporters Association Improves Water Foot Fees</h3>
<p>Since the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the import and export industry to formulate improvement measures for water foot fees, the industry association immediately convened a meeting of members to discuss them. The following points have now been decided: (1) Send a letter to the water foot industry associations of various countries to stipulate the water foot fees for goods transported to China, and send a copy to the association immediately. (2) Each shipping company should directly charge each customer and not subcontract it to small companies for handling, in order to eliminate intermediate exploitation. (3) Negotiate with the stevedoring industry association to determine contact methods in order to reduce theft losses. In addition, it is hoped that the various patrol teams and customs houses on the Huangpu River will quickly plan unified command.</p>
<h3>Tinfoil Inventory Registration: All Existing Stocks Must be Sold Off Within One Month; Overdue Items Will Require Payment of Additional Taxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tinfoil Association held its inaugural meeting. According to the chairman's report, the Goods Tax Bureau notified that the tinfoil industry must register its inventory and sell off all previous inventory within one month. Overdue items will require payment of additional taxes. The association has now applied for a postponement of collection and exemption of supplementary taxes. It is difficult to predict the result. However, merchants are not as optimistic about holding goods as they were before and are wary. Therefore, the market price has also slightly decreased.</p>
<h3>Meltons Soar in Price</h3>
<p>American meltons have suddenly risen from 22,000 yuan to 37,000 to 8,000 yuan within a week. The main reasons for this are that most of the stocks in the hands of domestic and foreign merchants have been sold out, the real sales of local customers are booming, and the customs mistakenly believes that imported declared goods are surplus materials, delaying certification is also a factor. According to general observations, if customs negotiations are completed by the end of this month or early next month and goods can be shipped, the market price may shrink.</p>
<h3>New Goods Tax to be Levied Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's promulgation of new goods taxes on several types of goods such as tea, wheat flour, wool, and cosmetics, has recently been opposed by the wool spinning and cosmetics industries, which are submitting telegrams to the central government for instructions. It is now learned that the bureau has decided to implement the above-mentioned new taxes starting tomorrow. Before receiving clear orders from the Ministry of Finance, the tax rates levied will also be handled in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Incoming Goods Are Out of Reach. The Rayon Problem is Serious.</h3>
<p>Rayon prices rose crazily last week. There are two main reasons for this. Since the Textile Construction Company stopped allocating silk numbers, the inventory in the market has been depleted day by day. Although there are rumors of foreign goods arriving in port, there is no news. Most cargo owners regard it as a rare commodity. This is the first reason. The list price allocated by the Textile Construction Company to various manufacturers has increased by 70% compared with the previous period, and the quantity has been reduced to 15 packages per factory. The amount allocated to general manufacturers is far less than the amount consumed. They have no choice but to search for purchases in the black market. This is the second reason. With these two main reasons, speculators are manipulating and monopolizing the market, resulting in the smooth sailing of the black market, which is unstoppable. At the beginning of the week, 120 Tianqiao Youguang was between 3.2 million and 3.3 million yuan. Later, it rose day by day, and even rose by 700,000 yuan in one day. By the weekend, it reached 5.3 million yuan, a surge of more than 2 million yuan in one week. With such a crazy rise, small silk factories are forced to shut down. If there are no new sources of supply, the silk weaving industry will be greatly hit.</p>
<h3>Paper Industry Faces Many Difficulties: Paper Mills are Hit by Foreign Goods; Trading Firms are Troubled by Excessive Capital Outlay; The Number of Eliminated Trading Firms Accounts for About Half</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Our reporter interviewed several paper industry leaders and community organizations yesterday and learned that the industry has not seen any improvement recently. Most paper merchants have a feeling that it is difficult to do business. After the exchange rate adjustment, the paper market was stimulated and invigorated for a while, but in the end, the actual sales in the market were limited and it was difficult to sustain. Furthermore, ordering goods from abroad often requires a prepayment of half the deposit. If the goods can arrive on time and quickly, paper merchants can still make a profit. Otherwise, long-term delays (this is said to be a common occurrence), coupled with high interest burdens, not only make it impossible to make a profit, but even require losses. It is reported that among foreign paper products, transparent paper and glass paper have better profits. Newsprint and Daolin paper have very thin profits. As for the products of this street, such as gray newsprint, the North faction was the main customer in the past. Other goods have sales in various ports. However, the unstable situation and traffic obstruction are the fatal blows to paper merchants in this city.</p>
<p>As far as the Paper Business Association of this city is concerned, it currently has a total of 599 member companies. The Zhongzhi Group accounts for more than 120 companies, and the Machine Paper Group accounts for more than 470 companies. General operations lack sufficient Chen. The operating expenses of each paper company have increased without decreasing. It is reported that in 1943, when the enemy and puppet arrogance was at its peak and the speculation and hoarding trend was prevalent, the association's members even reached 1,002. This has now become a thing of the past. The general paper companies that emerged in response to the times have all been eliminated with the times.</p>
<p>As far as the Paper Industry Association of this city is concerned, it also has 23 members, including Hailong, Hualun, Guangzhong, Qigong, and Minfeng. Among them, the factory sites of five members, including Datong, Minfeng, Liyong, Huasheng, and Hua, are all in other cities. These private paper mills are still suffering from raw material costs, high labor costs, and high interest rates in the current difficult situation of my country's industry. Coupled with the low-price competition of foreign goods, the situation is even more depressed. At present, the operating situation of each factory is intermittent, purely depending on market needs. As far as current products are concerned, Lianshi paper still has a small profit to be made. Other products, such as Mao Bian, Haiyue, poster paper, and gray newsprint, are already feeling strained in terms of profits. The price and quality of newsprint products cannot compete with foreign goods for even a short period of time. There are very few factories that are still manufacturing.</p>
<p>As for the factories taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Tianzhang East and West factories, the Jiangnan One and Two factories, the Sakurai Photosensitive Paper Factory, and the Jinxi Paper Mill have already started operations. It is reported that the Tianzhang Jiangnan factories are in a better situation. They are currently producing large quantities of banknote paper. In addition, the Taiwan Paper Corporation of the Assets Committee is also planning to set up an office in this city to promote the company's various yellow and white cardboard, poster paper, and newsprint. The American China Paper Corporation is also starting its engines, producing a wide variety of colored cardboard.</p>
<h3>Flying Tiger General Plans to Organize a Shipping Company, but the Aviation Committee Has Not Approved It</h3>
<p>Chennault, the leader of the Flying Tigers who fought against Japan in China, has recently been actively preparing to establish an air transport company in Shanghai to specialize in transporting relief supplies between China and the United States. The company has submitted an application to the Executive Yuan for approval and is preparing to start flying next month. However, the Aviation Committee and the Ministry of Transport believe that the measures for establishing private airlines in China have not yet been formulated, and no matter whether they are Chinese or foreigners, they are not allowed to establish airlines in China. Therefore, the Aviation Committee and the Ministry of Transport have refused to issue flight permits to the airline organized by Chennault and prohibited it from flying without authorization.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Prices Reach Highest Peak: $0.38 per Pound</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] New York cotton futures reached a new peak today, with the October and December contracts reaching $0.38 per pound, the highest peak for the latter since December 1919. Other recent contracts have risen to the highest prices since 1920.</p>
<h3>Business License Tax: Those Who Do Not Declare Today Will be Penalized According to Regulations</h3>
<p>The deadline for the declaration and payment of the business license tax for the 35th year in this city was originally the end of August this year due to the adjustment of capital. Subsequently, because the deadline had passed, many people had not declared. In order to show compassion for the difficulties of merchants, the Finance Bureau extended the deadline for another month from September 1st to the end of the month. All licensed businesses that have not yet adjusted their declarations and payments can uniformly declare to the License Tax Section of the bureau today, the last day, with their old licenses. Those who are overdue will be penalized according to regulations.</p>

<h3>Ford, the Automobile King: How He Manages Workers</h3>
<p>— Guo Hong</p>
<p>We have long been familiar with the career of automobile magnate Mr. Ford. We have also heard of the lives of Ford's workers, and we have a certain admirable envy for them. However, these are just vague rumors. A student studying in the United States, Mr. Luo Naishi, has written a record of his internship at the Ford factory, detailing the factory's labor policies and the lives of its workers. I will now excerpt and translate Mr. Luo's original text below for the reference of domestic manufacturers:</p>
<p>The Ford Motor Company in the United States is a very large organization. It has 100,000 workers and produces an average of 3,000 cars per day. Among the workers, there are all kinds of people: those with no skills, those with highly developed skills, native-born Americans, Canadians, Europeans, South Americans, West Asians, and Chinese (students). The situation is very complex, and all manufacturing business matters related to automobiles have classified work.</p>
<p>The Genius of Organization</p>
<p>The special feature of the Ford Company is its labor policy and the resulting lives of its workers. With the organizational genius of Mr. Ford, he has not only achieved success in the production of goods, but also established a model for dealing with labor and capital.</p>
<p>The Ford Company provides work for disabled workers, such as those who are blind or lame. Because there are many types of work, it is not difficult to find something for people with slight disabilities to do. However, these disabled people are often limited to those who have previously served the company and have unfortunately become ill.</p>
<p>The foremen in the Ford factory do not have the power to dismiss workers. When there are disputes between workers or between workers and supervisors, the foreman is ordered to suspend the worker for about ten days. Beyond this limit, the Employment Affairs Department must make a decision. If the foreman is found to be at fault and the worker is not guilty, the worker will remain in the factory but be transferred to another department to work.</p>
<p>Workers in the Ford factory can freely transfer to other departments for medical needs or because their talents are not suitable. Therefore, some workers are promoted to clerks. Thus, once a worker is hired, they will not be dismissed for failing to do their job. Because of transfers between departments, there is always suitable work to be done.</p>
<p>Every worker in a Ford factory initially earns five dollars a day for the first two months, and six dollars a day in the third month. The rate of wage increase is in increments of forty cents, and it becomes very difficult to increase it further once it reaches seven dollars and twenty cents. Wage increases depend on the nature and efficiency of the work, and the relationship with the foreman.</p>
<p>Regarding the training and education of workers, there are two organizations. One is the Ford Industrial Training School located in Highland Park, and the other is the school department attached to the Ford factory. The Industrial Training School accepts children around the age of twelve, who study for one week and work in the factory for two weeks. The purpose is to train them to become skilled machinists. All expenses are provided by the factory. The products of their work during the internship are actually used. The school department of the Ford factory has three schools: one teaching electrical engineering, one teaching machine repair and toolmaking, and one specializing in the training of supervisors in Ford companies in various locations. The first two schools are open to all workers in the Ford factory during their spare time. There are also exams and certificates are issued. Graduates of the school receive salary increases. However, despite this path for advanced education, the majority of Ford factory workers are still so-called unskilled workers. Because the division of labor is so precise, the procedures for workers are made very simple, and they only need to do it mechanically, without learning.</p>
<p>The Ford factory has a merchandise purchasing committee, which has four business departments: one for fruits and vegetables, one for meat, one for medicine, and one for clothing and miscellaneous goods. It is specifically for workers to purchase, and the selling price is 10% to 15% lower than the normal price. The Highland Park factory alone has daily transactions of $30,000.</p>
<p>Regarding the lives of workers in the Ford factory, when speaking of the time spent in the factory, they work eight hours a day. However, considering arriving early, leaving late, and the time spent traveling to and from the factory, each worker ultimately "needs nine and a half to ten hours of time. Workers' lunches are delivered by a meal service, with a small box of food for each person, and the price and nature are determined by the factory. Each box contains three meat sandwiches, a piece of dessert, a square biscuit, and an apple, banana, or orange. When the meal bell rings, workers rush to the food delivery truck. After getting the box, they find a convenient place to eat. Workers who live near the factory bring their own food to the factory and eat at the appointed time. The content of self-prepared food is naturally much better than that of the meal service.</p>
<p>Tense Work</p>
<p>The Ford factory operates day and night, with eight-hour shifts, requiring three shifts a day. Workers either work the night shift or the day shift, alternating every two weeks or one month. The three shifts are from 7 or 8 AM to 3 or 4 PM, from 3 or 4 PM to 11 or 12 PM, and from 12 PM to 7 or 8 AM. If these three shifts are rotated every two weeks, each worker will rotate through all three shifts in 42 days. This time rotation method is very detrimental to the order of workers' lives. However, the factory has no way to remedy it for the sake of fully utilizing the parts.</p>
<p>What do Ford workers think of the work they do and the attitude of the managers? This is a question that should be asked. There is only one answer to this question: people have the same heart, and factory workers will never voluntarily be loyal to their work. The work in the Ford factory is also divided into routine work and miscellaneous work. Routine work has fixed machines, fixed materials, and fixed expected products. Workers do it according to routine, and you cannot slack off, and it is easy to be detected if you slack off. Miscellaneous work is not the routine of doing a certain thing, moving, sweeping, and changing things at any time. Therefore, there is no certain sense of responsibility for the work, and they only want to slack off and are never willing to work hard.</p>
<p>Workers' Welfare</p>
<p>The welfare program for workers at the Ford factory is also quite well-known. The factory has established a special Investigation Department for the welfare program, which has more than 100 staff members. The Ford factory has set a minimum wage of $5 per day, which has a certain meaning. That is, it includes the workers' share of profits. The sharing of this profit is conditional on improving the workers' living conditions. The job of the Investigation Department is to investigate the workers' lives and report on them to be used as a basis. However, this department has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>The family lives of Ford workers vary greatly, from crude to beautified, in various forms. Most workers live a relatively high standard of living. Generally speaking, he is about 35 years old, has two or three children, and his wife is always a little younger than him. She is diligent and frugal at home and may be able to save some money. Whether his home is owned or rented, it is always spacious and often has spare rooms for rent. The equipment and appliances in the home are mostly complete. There are also some books to decorate, as well as a piano or radio, and facilities for telephone, water, electricity, and gas. Needless to say, he also has a car produced by the Ford factory. The three meals a day are still decent. When he is dressed neatly, he is no less than an ordinary businessman.</p>
<p>Ford workers certainly do not read books. Few of them have ever reached the eighth grade of elementary school, so they do not like to read, do not like to listen to lectures, do not like art, and do not like music. But he reads the daily newspaper every day. Although he does not read much, his appearance is quite good. He has practical knowledge, he knows mechanical processing, he understands blueprints, he knows how to handle automobiles, and he also has some natural knowledge and hygiene knowledge. As for entertainment events, in addition to driving around on holidays, or going to the suburbs for swimming, fishing, and hunting, or playing ball games, or playing billiards, or watching plays, or going to the park, or going to the dance hall; those with a more depraved inclination will inevitably have gambling behavior.</p>
<h3>Ten Commandments for Supervisors</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>A supervisor must take care of all aspects to make his career successful. Here are ten rules that must be followed:</p>
<p>(1) Set a good example, don't just use rules.</p>
<p>(2) Be kind and fair to your subordinates, then the lower levels will respect you.</p>
<p>(3) Do not use tricks or politics, openness and honesty are the best policy.</p>
<p>(4) Establish good relationships with all parties, and all words and deeds must come from the heart.</p>
<p>(5) Correct mistakes by using suggestions and examples, not just criticism.</p>
<p>(6) Do not answer easily. Think carefully before answering, and implement it thoroughly after answering.</p>
<p>(7) Do not be discouraged and stop doing things because others criticize you. Everything can be said from both sides.</p>
<p>(8) Do not be stubborn, because you are dealing with human beings, not institutions.</p>
<p>(9) Instead of ordering subordinates to take responsibility, it is better to guide subordinates to work together.</p>
<p>(10) All actions and words must be accurate and precise, so that people can easily understand and implement them.</p>
<h3>Production News: Radio that Replaces Clocks and Watches</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Someone in the United States is designing a small radio that specializes in receiving broadcasts from the time signal station attached to the National Bureau of Standards. No matter day or night, you only need to turn on the switch to hear the most accurate time.</p>
<p>This radio is less than half the size of a cigarette case and can be carried around or placed in a handbag.</p>
<p>This timekeeping service will be first launched in New York City, with a shortwave station set up on the top floor of the tallest building, broadcasting the time of the Washington Bureau of Standards all day long. The accuracy can reach only one ten-millionth of a second. The broadcast can sometimes insert simple weather reports or the latest news summaries, lasting no more than ten seconds. The designer believes that this is easy to do and does not require a large amount of capital. In the future, the selling price of that pocket radio will not be more expensive than a good watch.</p>
<p>Panicillin in Short Supply</p>
<p>Since the war, the use of penicillin has increased day by day, and the production volume has also increased accordingly. Now the needs of all parties have increased to 80 million units per month, which is 10 million units more than the current total output of all experimental factories in the United States.</p>
<p>In order to avoid shortages, the US government has restarted purchase restrictions. Therefore, botanists at the University of Wisconsin are stepping up experiments to find ways to rapidly increase production. They have discovered that using ultraviolet light can greatly increase production.</p>
<p>Recently, the US Department of Agriculture is using penicillin to treat animal diseases. If the results are good, the demand for penicillin will inevitably increase significantly. Perhaps the method invented by the University of Wisconsin can solve the difficulty.</p>
<h3>Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Deng Shaoqiu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yifan, the publicity director of the Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition, once said with great experience, "The economic crisis is now extremely serious, so we should promote exports. Although this is not the right time, we must look at the long term. We may as well exhibit it and express it with statistics, so that everyone has a deep impression and that those who care about the export business have concrete materials and facts to study and improve."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong Ketuo, who was sitting in the same room, felt the same way about the fact that the market was flooded with American goods, which not only affected the business of several companies and firms, but also directly destroyed the development of domestic goods. Therefore, under the proposal of Mr. Yifan, the Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition was established with the hope of Mr. Xiang, Mr. Qin Xiangzhou, and Mr. Li Dingmo, who inadvertently decided to try six companies this time. Of course, they also worked hard on publicity for several months, planned the venue arrangements, maintained close contact with the industry, and held several special seminars in turn. They also received enthusiastic assistance from the American Embassy and the China-America Business Association. Tomorrow—October 1st, this export exhibition, which should occupy a page in the history of Chinese exports, will be unveiled in front of a large audience.</p>
<p>The exhibition venue is at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The position of the exhibits is one unit per hundred square feet. There are 53 units in the entire venue. The distribution of each room is as follows: Room 303 has three units, displaying lacquer, pottery, enamel, and bone ware. Room 320 has four units, specializing in displaying tung oil. The assembly hall has seven units, displaying hardware, toothbrushes, leather, fur, oil, and egg products. Xuegengtang has eight units—displaying lace embroidery, knitted cotton fabrics, carpets, handkerchiefs, and underwear. The library has five units—displaying wine, tea, raw silk. The gym has twenty-six units, including straw hats, glass, thermos bottles, local specialties, light bulbs, and building materials.</p>
<p>The participating manufacturers of the exhibits include more than 50 companies such as Xinguang Underwear Weaving Factory, Huade Light Bulb Factory, and Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory. The exhibition period is six days.</p>
<p>It is said that the association also plans to distribute a special publication to all visitors—"Letter to the National Industry" and "Reducing the Cost of Domestic Goods," which is old news, but still correct.</p>
<p>The Minister of Economic Affairs said that to save the import surplus crisis, the first is for people to save money, the second is to reduce the cost of domestic goods, and the third is to improve the quality of domestic goods. Regarding the first point, people are now poor and have reduced purchasing power. Most people save as much as they can, and there is nothing they can save. The second and third points are related. The cost can be reduced in order to improve the quality. Now our cost cannot be reduced because the tax rate is too high. Therefore, our unanimous request today is to exempt commodity tax in order to protect this budding domestic industry and commerce, reduce costs, and prevent foreign companies from destroying it.</p>
<h3>New Portable Television</h3>
<h3>Silk and Nylon</h3>
<p>— Ren Hengliang</p>
<p>Recently, American nylon stockings have flooded the market. In terms of quality, they are indeed slightly better than domestically produced hosiery, but in terms of price, nylon stockings cost more than 30,000 yuan a pair, while domestic silk stockings cost only 10,000 yuan a pair. Therefore, if we compare the size of the price with the quality, it is still cost-effective to wear domestic silk stockings. However, recently, the mentality of Chinese people taking pride in using foreign goods has become a trend, which is actually an extremely erroneous concept. The beauty of American goods is an undeniable fact, but to what extent is it good? Of course, there is a limit. Now, let's compare the quality of nylon and natural silk. (Table based on Chemical World, Volume 1, Issue 3)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, compared with natural silk stockings, the difference between nylon stockings is at most 50%. That is, one and a half pairs of silk stockings can be worth one pair of nylon stockings, but in terms of price, nylon stockings are three times more expensive than silk stockings. Moreover, according to those who have worn nylon stockings, they do not absorb moisture in summer, which may cause skin diseases, and they do not keep warm in winter, and they feel cold on the feet. Silk stockings do not have these drawbacks, and they are equally beautiful in appearance.</p>

<h3>New Myth</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>My old friend, Pan Cironi, is a small civil servant in the city of Rome. He doesn't want to make a name for himself, but he keeps complaining about his position. Therefore, one day I said to him, "Why don't you think of a way to improve your situation? Climbing up and getting a higher position will make it easier to deal with this life." After hearing my words, he said, "What, ask me to climb a ladder piled up with this bunch of guys?" I said, "Change it. I have never heard of this before. There is no revolution from above, unless you mean the collective suicide of all senior officials, diplomats, and politicians. Do you really believe that when you have become accustomed to this kind of life, this kind of corruption, and especially this kind of inhuman servility, you can still change something that has already changed your entire humanity? Have you ever heard of a person being swallowed by his own feces?"</p>
<p>There is one thing he approves of Mussolini and even Hitler, that is, "We need a new myth," he said. "I have already got this myth. For example, take the country as an example. A country is like a beast. Its posture is like a dog playing. The chin rests on the floor, clamped between the two front paws. The latter half of the body is propped up on its two hind legs. Generations of young people are like worms crawling on the floor towards the dog's mouth to be swallowed by it. The dog honestly and unceremoniously uses its big tongue to eat these worms, then chews them up, and then swallows them. Yes, my myth starts from this, because it swallows these worms up, not down. After these worms are swallowed up, their status in this political or bureaucratic belly becomes higher and higher. Every small civil servant hopes that he will be digested faster than others. He hopes to get out as smoothly as possible until he finally "comes out". I don't need to describe what happened later. You know, after they drill out, people call them "master". Dear friends, you all hope to be promoted to prominence quickly, but I would rather be left in the dark dog's belly forever undigested."</p>
<p>Note: "This is a translation. I can't write it myself. The original work was written by an Italian writer living in America, Nicola Tucci, and published in the Comrade Review, Winter 1946."</p>
<h3>The Reproduction of Huang Zi's Works</h3>
<p>— Liang Youyan</p>
<p>Among Chinese composers, the most popular is Mr. Huang Zi. His "Family Happiness Song" is as appreciated by people as Zhao Yuanren's "How Can I Not Think of Him," and it has remained unchanged for a long time; this shows that good art has permanent value.</p>
<p>Compared with Xian Xinghai, who died in Moscow last year, or He Luting, who is still alive, Mr. Huang Zi has fewer works in terms of quantity; but Huang Zi's secret of success lies in: only seeking fine products, not seeking high output; this is the same as the success of playwright Cao Yu.</p>
<p>Among Huang Zi's works, ranging from the instrumental overture "Nostalgic Melody"—with which he won the top graduation award at the Yale University School of Music in the United States, creating his position abroad—to the small song "Flowers Are Not Flowers" (words by Bai Juyi), and the well-known "Family Happiness" song, "Blue Sky, White Sun, Crimson Ground" (chorus, it is said that this song was originally prepared to be the national anthem of our country, but it was not selected; in fact, many people think that the melody and mood of this song are more magnificent than today's national anthem.) "The Flag Is Flying," "Hot Blood," "National Flag Song,"... it can be said that none of them are not full of strong emotions and endless taste, even people who are not very Musicai will feel "easy to understand and never tire of listening to" when they hear Huang Zi's songs. But one thing worth noting is that good songs are not necessarily understood by most people, and music that pleases the public is not necessarily good. However, Huang Zi's things show both aspects: they can be accepted by people from many aspects, and they do not hinder their own unique style; his works are neither profound nor vulgar, and sometimes, his melody is also full of both flavors, such as the beginning of "The Flag Is Flying"; but at the same time, he is also good at giving play to the wonderful aspects of Eastern sentiments, such as the first sentence of "Family Happiness" (using the Chinese pentatonic scale to conduct its melody). The study of his success should be attributed to his good use of the wonderful aspects of Eastern and Western sentiments, and at the same time, he is good at reconciling these two extreme components. This is the origin of Huang Zi's style, and this is the method he used to create his own unique style.</p>
<p>Among Chinese musicians, in terms of national music, I admire the late Mr. Liu Tianhua, and in terms of Western music, I like Huang Zi's works very much. Unfortunately, both of them are short-lived artists. Huang Zi died at the age of only thirty-four. He was one year younger than the short-lived musician Mozart (who lived to be thirty-five years old). He saw the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but he did not see the victory of the war (he died in April 1938). However, he had already done his best for the national struggle. He wrote "Song of Resistance Against the Enemy" and "The Flag Is Flying," which are both outstanding among the songs of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>I didn't lie, and I didn't deliberately emphasize it. I really love Huang Zi's works. Therefore, I rushed to listen to the last day of the "Huang Zi Works Concert" organized by the Shanghai Music Society this time.</p>
<p>Cantata "Song of Everlasting Regret": "...I only hate that love in the world is always difficult to fall in love with. Now I am specially favored and honored. I am afraid that the beauty will grow old, but it is like a cold autumn fan....</p>
<p>In the mortal world, there are many infatuated people, and the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion are in vain to make lovesickness dreams. I can't understand that the flowers in the mirror and the moon in the water will eventually become empty."</p>
<p>This program was performed with mixed chorus or duet and symphony orchestra accompaniment, conducted by Mr. Huang Yongxi. The organization of the chorus is still very sound; originally, the organization of vocal music is more difficult than the organization of instrumental music, and the preparation and training of talents in a choir are often thankless. In this choir, most of them are professional youths from all walks of life. They have the determination to devote themselves to music, but for the sake of life, they can only regard music as a side job. It is because of this that the organization and training of a choir are really not easy. The choir participating in the performance of the Shanghai Music Society this time is still considered to be doing its duty in both the female and male sections. Mr. Huang's conducting is also very crisp and powerful, and many small details are especially clear, and there are not too many tricks, and it seems that it can also produce the side effect of "the conductor gives beauty".</p>
<p>The lady who participated in the duet in the second section of "Song of Everlasting Regret", "The Seventh Day of the Seventh Month in the Hall of Eternal Life", had a weak voice, so in the accompaniment of the orchestra, her voice was simply very weak, and the emotions could not be expressed. Miss Gao Zhilan's singing of her "Three Wishes for Roses" was even more brilliant, and she was asked to "do it again." In the second repeat, her pronunciation was purer, because in the first time, her voice seemed to have a feeling of "rustling" when the melody went high, but it was gone in the second time.</p>
<p>The concert ended in the four-part mixed chorus of "The Flag Is Flying". This program was unusually exciting, and the audience also asked for another one. Therefore, this performance was considered a complete success. In Shanghai, there is a lack of great vocal music. Recalling that Japan had performed Beethoven's choral symphony (Ninth Symphony) many years ago, it makes people feel that Shanghai urgently needs to establish a vocal music organization! Here, I wish the Shanghai Music Society more powerful! At the same time, I am more grateful to Mr. Huang Zi for giving us a rich legacy!</p>

<h3>In the Village</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>Cooking Smoke</p>
<p>Arriving here—this village desolate for three years—I see wisps of cooking smoke rising again from the low thatched huts. This earth, cleansed by disaster, is beginning to revive.</p>
<p>The silent, ancient waterwheel is singing by the river again. A wave of sowing laughter rises from the green fields, and clear mountain songs echo in the blue sky. Birds soar freely in the air, and the fragrance of wildflowers fills the air... Our village is growing up in the spring.</p>
<p>Our hardworking farmers no longer sit by the river weeping.</p>
<p>Today, they possess this vast land, many livestock, and farming tools... Their days are truly joyful! Their lives are truly peaceful! The light of their lives is shining brightly!</p>
<p>And so, wisp after wisp of cooking smoke rises again in the village, lingering in the evening sky.</p>
<p>Cattle Pen</p>
<p>In that dim and damp cattle pen, the calves are lowing softly, chewing on the tender green grass, laden with dew, that the farm women have just cut from the fields. A little girl stands outside the cattle pen, gazing intently. What does her little heart hope to unearth from that deep cattle pen?</p>
<p>Cobwebs hang thickly on the roof beams, an old lantern hangs under the eaves, and a wave of putrid air blows out from the cattle pen in the evening breeze.</p>
<p>In past years, in the days when disaster struck, farmers lost their livestock and their farmland, gasping daily on the brink of starvation and death. The cattle pen quietly dreamt nightmares of the night during the day.</p>
<p>Now, the cattle pen has awakened from a long night of nightmares. Many calves crowd together, lowing, and the humble thatched huts overflow with the cheers of life.</p>
<p>Country Path</p>
<p>Today, I walk on the country path paved with pebbles of quartz, and my heart feels very happy. I see that our working people have started working in the fields again.</p>
<p>They walk busily, one by one, humming mountain songs, carrying their respective farming tools, seeds, and fertilizer...</p>
<p>When the harvest season arrives, how busy they will be! Even the children must work! With work, their lives seem solid...</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 48</h3>
<p>— Ye Jinfeng</p>
<p>However, at that time, good news kept coming, again and again, and again. To say that I felt no excitement or joy at all would be an insincere lie. It was because of this excitement that I rushed to Dingyuan’s place with these good news, telling their family one by one. Just as I finished speaking, the station's employee also rushed in, reporting, "Our troops in Wanping have driven away all the Japanese troops nearby and are now in pursuit."</p>
<p>"What a pity!" Dingyuan was leaning against the pillows on the bed. Hearing these triumphant news, he suddenly slapped the edge of the bed and sat up straight. For a moment, he was unable to...</p>
<p>I was just about to hear what he meant by "What a pity" and how he was "unable for a moment," when I saw him staring blankly at his own legs under the thin sheet.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" He didn't say anything, so I had to ask. His wife and Meijun were both present and were also stunned, not knowing what he was thinking.</p>
<p>"I really want to..." He paused. "I really want to take a trip to Beiping at this time, but I'm afraid these legs...won't be able to..."</p>
<p>"Brother, why are you in such a hurry?" Meijun interjected.</p>
<p>"Really, listen, the fighting is very fierce. Even if there is a car and you have the energy, I'm afraid of stray bullets..." Mrs. Wu also advised.</p>
<p>Before Meijun could let her mother finish speaking, she interjected, "According to what Uncle Yue said just now, our troops are fighting so well. Why not wait another half a day and let them fight further. You'll feel better, and going to Beiping will be easy, won't it?"</p>
<p>"Child," Dingyuan looked at Meijun solemnly, "I understand what you mean. You're afraid that my body can't handle it, and you're afraid that the road will be difficult and dangerous. You must know that although our family is not like ordinary people, with slogans like "Dedicate oneself to the country," we must know that "military affairs are like fire." Perhaps at this time, we are short of someone who understands telecommunications, and we are short of nurses like you. Besides, as for the danger, I'm not looking for bad luck early in the morning. In the future, in the army, can you say that if there is danger, you won't go forward? Don't you see our troops charging into the cannons?..."</p>
<p>"I plan," he looked at me again, "I plan to trouble you, "seeing the Buddha all the way to the West," to find a way to get a car. If it's a big car, we'll all go. If the car is small, I'll take Shiren, and we'll go, father and son. He's old enough to support me a little. What do you think, old brother?..."</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment and looked at Meijun and Mrs. Wu. They were staring at me, probably wanting me to say a few words of dissuasion. I felt that they had two different opinions now, and both sides had their own reasons: one side was arguing for "seizing the opportunity," and the other side was arguing for safety.</p>
<p>"I think," I spoke to all three giants of their family, "Brother, sister-in-law, great-niece, we're not outsiders, so I'll say what's on my mind. Brother's opinion is not wrong; sister-in-law and great-niece's words also have sufficient reason. There are plenty of cars, as long as I make a phone call to Beiping, small cars, big cars, even two or three, I can get them. I can't guarantee the safety issue because the war situation changes rapidly. However, for the sake of brother's matter, I can accompany you there and accompany you back, even if we take a detour. We can detour west to the Fire Ash Factory; if not, we can detour west to Jietai Temple or Mentougou, which is only half an hour more. If we're fast, we can finish the work and get home for lunch; if we're a little slower, we can get home before dinner... However, to sum it all up, to sum it all up, it must be the unanimous opinion of your whole family... What do you all think?..." I was not acting like an old fox who was unwilling to take responsibility for others. You think, in such turbulent times of war, who dares to take such responsibility for anyone?</p>

<h3>Offering School to Celebrate Birthday</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>President Chiang's sixtieth birthday this year, someone proposed, dedicate schools to celebrate his birthday, embodying the cultivation of talents in the commemoration of the supreme leader's great achievements. This move is quite meaningful. I remember two years before the War of Resistance, during the year of President's Chiang's fiftieth birthday, there was a nationwide movement to donate aircraft to celebrate his birthday. The effects of that movement had substantial benefits for the subsequent War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, national reconstruction is the urgent task. And the most important work of national reconstruction is to popularize education and cultivate talents. The school donation movement can be said to be in line with the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Civilization swept the floor. After eight years of war in the occupied territories, not only education has gone bankrupt, but morality has been destroyed. We are heartbroken by the various illegal and undisciplined phenomena in society today. If we do not strive to remedy this in our generation and no longer think about the next generation, the future of our nation is truly unthinkable!</p>
<p>Schools are lacking, and this situation is even worse in the smaller counties and more remote areas of various provinces. Students cannot afford tuition. All of this naturally creates problems for the knowledge of the next generation.</p>
<p>Commemorating the President's birthday in this way is probably what the President would most gladly agree to, because it simultaneously alleviates the current suffering of students who are out of school. I hope everyone can respond quickly and work together to achieve this.</p>
<p>Mental Hygiene</p>
<h3>How to Control Emotions</h3>
<p>— Gui Ting</p>
<p>Just Like Driving a Horse</p>
<p>Emotional impulses can make a person's heart beat faster, increase blood pressure, and even lead to muscle spasms. Excessive disgust can cause a person to feel nauseous and vomit, and excessive panic can cause a person to faint on the spot.</p>
<p>According to Dr. G. Colket Caone M.D., a professor of neurology at Harvard University, it is not other people's words and actions that make us feel unhappy or tired. The main reason lies in our own emotional reactions. If we were completely indifferent, neither angry nor jealous, then no one could disturb our emotions.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, emotional impulses are not a bad thing. In many ways, they can help the body prepare for various actions, such as promoting blood circulation in the muscles and adding more sugar to the blood to provide special strength.</p>
<p>Excitement and Impulses</p>
<p>A person cannot give a brilliant speech if his emotions do not become aroused. Similarly, an athlete cannot win a championship in a race if he feels no excitement at all.</p>
<p>However, emotional impulses are only beneficial to us when they stimulate us to consider in advance how to deal with future environments or encourage us to actively fight with the environment. However, most of the reasons that disturb our emotions lie in various threatening factors; for example, losing our loved ones, the pressure of family environment, the impact of health, worries about unemployment, and economic difficulties. If we doubt our ability to cope, new environments are enough to create a terrible threat to us.</p>
<p>Train Yourself</p>
<p>Therefore, we must train ourselves how to actively consider, plan, and cope with new environments when threatened. We must adopt a positive attitude towards various threatening factors. This is the most reasonable attitude everyone should hold. This attitude is "No matter what happens, we must deal with it calmly." This is completely the opposite of the attitude of "We hope that such things will not happen." Doing so, we will naturally be calm and will never worry unnecessarily. Even if something unexpected happens, we will already be fully prepared to deal with it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we hold the attitude of "We hope that such things will not happen," then we will always feel uneasy. Even if we have been safe for a long time, we will still feel unstable. Because the possibility of expected things happening always exists. Such an attitude thus leads to anxiety, fatigue, and other physiological symptoms such as heart palpitations or indigestion.</p>
<p>Emotional control is like controlling a horse. We must learn how to drive it, keep it in check at all times, and train it to be able to move forward bravely and continue to advance in any situation. Only in this way can we control our emotions and make them exert unparalleled power.</p>
<p>Muscle Tension</p>
<p>Emotional illnesses are mostly caused by muscle tension. Therefore, relaxing the muscles and allowing them to enjoy full rest will have an infinitely calming effect on the mind. Relaxing our muscles will make us feel: "Everything is in order." Therefore, we must develop the ability and habit to rest anytime and anywhere. Let us put aside all public and private affairs every day, rest quietly for a few minutes, and rest several times more. The ideal times to rest are before getting up in the morning and before going to bed at night.</p>
<p>Complete Rest</p>
<p>When a person goes to bed, he should relax all the muscles of his body and let the brain enjoy complete rest. He should absolutely not use his brain or worry about things. He should clear his mind to a vacuum, let it rest and recuperate. As for whether to sleep during the day or not, it is not necessarily necessary. What is needed is rest, real rest, and full rest. We must learn how to rest in order to control our emotions and increase our physical and mental well-being (the content of this article is taken from Dr. Canal's famous book "How to Deal with the Environment").</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— Mo Gao</p>
<p>After the tragedy in Yugoslavia, an American reporter talked about how to beat a dog: hit it with a stick so that it cannot turn over. He said, "Good people give way one step, bad dogs take two steps forward, good people kick back, and the bad dogs have to run away."</p>
<p>This is not only a warning to the United States at the moment, but also a sharp stick pointed at the national conditions of our country.</p>
<p>On Labor Day in the United States, the New York Daily News, which sells 4.6 million copies a day, had an editorial commemorating Labor Day and Victory Day. In the final conclusion, it said, "If we now tell another country the secrets of making atomic bombs, then we are no different from being naked."</p>
<h3>Second Nature</h3>
<p>— Mo</p>
<p>Before developing a new habit, you should be determined to test whether you can govern yourself.</p>
<p>Once you have embarked on a new path, there should be no more exceptions, just like throwing a wound ball of thread to the ground. One wrong step can often completely destroy previous efforts.</p>
<p>Put your good intentions into practice at any time; but if your good habits have already produced considerable results, you should not be complacent, let alone be satisfied.</p>
<p>The benefit of habit is that it enables us to be consistent. Habit is the axis of good social progress. In a good society, everyone first develops good habits. If you are unhappy, it can lead us through this troublesome time, assist us in doing those trivial and annoying chores, and encourage us to do important work. It can also save us mental energy and increase precise procedures.</p>
<p>The more good habits, the easier life is, and the more the power to resist temptation increases.</p>
<p>"Although habit is not equal to nature, habit is second nature."</p>
<h3>Merchant's Heart</h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>Recalling the year after Shanghai fell to the Japanese invaders, I happened to talk about national affairs with a rice merchant, and he said:</p>
<p>"...: However, if China were to fall to Japan, it would not be a big harm to us rice merchants; because the Japanese also eat rice. If China were to fall to a country that eats bread, then we rice merchants would have no way to survive!" Sun Liren on the India-Burma Front</p>
<p>Before the victory, Stilwell and Sun Liren discussed the counter-offensive on the India-Burma front.</p>
<p>News Figure</p>
<h3>Famous General Sun Liren</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>In China, there are only a few graduates of the American West Point Military Academy, and among these few, General Sun Liren is the one who has established extraordinary achievements on the battlefield and is famous at home and abroad.</p>
<p>A Good Story in the Army</p>
<p>Before the victory, no one in the Chinese and American officers and soldiers on the India-Burma battlefield did not know the name of Sun Liren, and everyone had a very deep impression engraved in their hearts. General Stilwell once said to General Zheng Dongguo, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India: "Chinese generals are also very good!" However, the one who is most unforgettable is Sun Liren, the commander of the New First Army.</p>
<p>I remember in February of the thirty-third year [1944], General Sun commanded the Mengguan Campaign in the Hukawng Valley, and the attack was unsuccessful, and the battle was extremely fierce. At that time, he vowed to grow a full beard and resolutely told his comrades: "I will not shave my beard until I enter Mengguan"—later, Mengguan was finally captured on March 9. General Sun also shaved off every single hair of his beard. Since then, this interesting story of his has been passed down on the India-Burma battlefield and became a popular tale.</p>
<p>He was originally a graduate of Tsinghua University, and later studied in the United States; because he became interested in military affairs, he entered the West Point Military Academy to study. Therefore, American officers all knew that he was a graduate of a Chinese university and looked up to him. He spoke very fluent English and often had long conversations with American officers. Also because of this, he became very familiar with figures in the American military.</p>
<p>The True Color of a Soldier</p>
<p>In peacetime, you see his gentle and elegant attitude, and you think he is a scholar; on the battlefield, you see his brave and good fighting spirit and his perseverance, and you cannot help but admit that he is a brave general. Once he arrives on the battlefield, he fully displays his true soldierly nature. As long as he is determined to attack a certain place, no matter how difficult it is, he will definitely take it down. If his subordinates are slightly negligent in military orders, he will immediately punish them. This kind of attitude of his not only prevents his subordinates from acting recklessly, but even the American officers and soldiers are equally afraid of him. All the American officers and soldiers under his command are very careful.</p>
<p>It is said that an American messenger delivered an official document to him, because he did not understand Chinese military etiquette. Following American practices, he entered his office. He suddenly flew into a rage and insisted that the American soldier follow the regulations of military etiquette. The American soldier was so anxious that he had a big headache. He had to shout "Report" in English at the door first, and then, after he answered "Come in" inside, the American messenger dared to enter. He continued to give a fifteen-degree bow according to the rules, and handed the official document to him with both hands. After signing it, the American soldier retrieved the receipt book and, as usual, bowed another fifteen degrees before stepping out of his office. Since then, American officers and soldiers have paid special attention to Chinese etiquette, especially in front of Sun Liren, and dare not be casual.</p>
<p>Going to Europe for Observation</p>
<p>He led his troops strictly, repeatedly made extraordinary achievements, and was deeply appreciated by Chairman Chiang and valued by General Eisenhower; so after the counter-offensive in India and Burma was won, Germany surrendered, and the European war ended, General Eisenhower specially sent a special plane to take General Sun to Paris to inspect the European battlefield and the fortifications and positions of the German army. He did not return to Japan until May of this year, when he finally returned to China.</p>
<p>Recently, he has been honorably appointed as the Commander of the Fourth Pacification District and concurrently as the Commander of the Changchun Garrison. After the Battle of Sipingjie, the communist army in the Northeast cannot but admire this brave general who fought in India.</p>
