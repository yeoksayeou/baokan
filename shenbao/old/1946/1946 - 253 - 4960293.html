<p>〔本報北平九日電〕美第七艦隊司令柯克上將，九日晨在北京飯店招待記者，駱基少將陪同招待。柯克首先聲明，渠並未說美國將視中國內爭之變化而改變對中國內爭態度。渠稱：在靑島時，曾有人問駐華美軍是否將參與中國內爭，渠答以吾，爲供應軍調部及美軍所需物資，而運來很多東西，但不信有人指責此種物資除爲和平外美尙存有他種目的。安平事件有調査小組，美方報吿確爲運輸供給品途中被人攻擊，對方却謂美方先開槍打人，並指此種物資爲帮助中國打內戰而運來，然吾人深信此事件必有一合理解決，且不影響軍調部工作。繼答記者問稱：在華美軍任務。大部已完成，以後乃助中國訓練軍隊，並辦理出讓物資，上海美軍即將移調靑島。某記者問美軍駐華期限及目的，柯克稱：爲保護美商在華權益，尙有暫時留駐的必要，待中國局勢改善，當即撤去。最後某記者問，美軍之保有秦皇島至靑島運輸錢，究與供給軍調部物資有多大關係，柯克稱：除供軍調部運物資外，當然還有目的，柯克十日飛靑，其旗艦候於靑島。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平九日電〕柯克上將稱：關於安平事件，如軍調部判決係於共方有利，則此後接濟軍調部之物資可能被切斷。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京九日電〕共產黨發言人王炳南，昨晚發出警吿稱：倘五人委員會不幸而「產下天折」　是即國共決裂與美國調解終吿失敗之謂。渠稱：該委員會能吾開會，須視政府是否頒布停戰命會而定。渠又稱：倘該委員會不　召開會議，勢必促成國共之最後決裂。截至目前爲止，政府迄無表示願保證頒發停戰命令之意向。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京九日電〕據此間政界觀察家稱：最近兩月中政府在軍　上之節節勝利，已使共軍地位尤為不利，不得已似已採取末着，倘政府不允無條件停戰，則將以另組政府，另行冶集國民大會爲恫嚇。目前政局最重大之發展，即爲軍事形勢之轉變。</p>

<p>〔中央社巴黎九日電〕王外長世杰，定九月十日取道倫敦返京。離此期間，我國首席代表一職將由郭泰祺氏担任。</p>
<p>〔合眾社紐約九日電〕紐約時報今日發表中國外長王世杰在巴黎接見記者談話稱：中國不擬對日本提出非日本所能負擔之賠償要求或對日本採取報復政策。王外長將於星期二離法前往南京。渠預測五種和約將在巴黎成立，但堅稱此事不必保證五强能對日本及德國問題成立協議。渠謂：日本問題「應較德國問題爲簡單，因日本本身無軍縮可言，同時應得最大賠償之中美二國均不致提出過份之要求也·中國各重大都市所受戰事損失慘重，但至今尙朱獲有賠償之數字。同時吾人現正研究如何拆除日本之工業設備，以防日本重整軍備。遠東列强所面臨之唯一重要問題，厥爲和約成立以後之管制問題，美國所提解除日本軍備廿五年之四强公約建議，中·蘇·英三國應予以接受，蘇聯旣未佔領日本，則其接受此項遠東公約當較接受德國之公約爲簡單。此外朝鮮問題當然爲一難問題也」。</p>
<h3>美國對華政府協會　揭發中共之陰謀　指出目前談判係屬欺騙性質　致函總統要求支持國民政府</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕前曾居住於中國之若干美國人士，今日致函杜魯門總統，稱市國共產黨爲「背信之叛徒」，並敦促全力及無條件支持蔣主席所領導之合法政府。美國對華政策協會，包括該協會之理事衆議員楚德，與一時代」及一生治」雜誌發行人魯期之夫人在內，亦要求蘇聯根據雅爾達協定與中蘇條約，將不應由其控制之中國領土交還中國政府。該函中並附有中國共產黨中央政治局第十六號通吿之譯文，其中指出中國共產黨與馬歇爾將軍所進行之談判，「係屬欺騙性質，並無成立協議之意向，目的僅在爭取時間」，藉以鞏固中國共產黨之實力，以謀佔有全中國。該協會認爲，此項文件，足以顯示蘇聯依然控制中國共產黨，於一九四三年在名義上業已解散之第三國際遠東局，事實上依然存在，中國共產黨之行動與政策，依然受第三國際之支配。該函中並要求改組國務院之遠東司，該司各要職應由完全贊成上述美國政策之人物担任之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約八日電〕美國對華政策協會今日發表其所謂中國共產黨受莫斯科控制及無意與蔣主席成立協議之證據。據稱：中共擬利用和平商談以遷延時日，俾得乘機鞏固其地盤，自蘇聯取得軍備，在東北編練軍隊，其中一部份係屬日人，高麗人及僞軍，滲入國民黨轄境，並設法離間美國對於蔣主席之同情與援助。此項結論謂係以中共中央政治局第十六號文吿爲根據，此項文吿係三月十二日所決定，現已譯成英文。由該會總幹事魯密斯簽字，抄錄一份送呈杜魯門總統。該會會長即上海密動士評論報發行人鮑威爾。該會總幹事魯密斯前曾任中國新聞處理事。據談稱：協曾現有會員一百餘人，至中共中央政治局第十六號文吿，何以爲該協會獲悉，魯氏未予說明。僅謂供給此項證據者，係一極可靠之人。由文吿措詞觀之，可知係受莫斯科控制，該文吿已指出其所提計劃業得共產黨遠東局之同意。據稱：該局係一九四三年解散之共產國際所屬組織。文吿內提及一面談判，一面繼續作戰之策略，並謂；東北爲發動局部攻勢之最佳地區，因其「接近我偉大之盟國蘇聯，在該區內吾人不致為獲得接濟而發生問題。」此外並向談判和平之中共代表建議，利用革命的策略，離間美國與蔣主席之關係。復稱：「同時吾人應採拖延政策，在與國民黨談判時，不解決任何問題，藉以動搖人民信心，使國民黨政治地位陷於不穩固。」對華政策協會力促杜魯門總統要求放棄對中國民衆所施之政治控制。</p>

<h3>調整關稅稅率須經合法程序</h3>
<p>實施期當在數月後</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕財部周參事談，調整關稅事，係由關務署所主管稅率如何釐訂，亦由該署按各方實際情形，予以簽擬，再由財部參事廳簽註意見後，由部長決定，實施以前，仍須經政院會議通過，始可頒佈，故爲期至少當在數月以後，絕非短期內所可草率決定。</p>

<p>（圖爲英大使招待記者時神情，本報攝。）</p>
<h3>中英商約談判　尚未正式開始　認中國內爭須自身加以遏止</h3>
<p>至此，各記者先後發問，大使一一作答，其較主要者如下：（一）問·中英商約談判情形若何？答，談判尙未正式開始，惟數月之前，英方曾有商約草案全份，送交中國政府。（二）問·現居中國之外僑，在國境內移動時，亦需簽照，不知將來訂約之時，英國亦將採取相似措施，使華僑於英境內移動時，亦需簽照否？答，外僑在英國境內，決無由倫敦至利物浦即須簽照之舉，中國如欲開放，似亦宜對外國來華之賓客稍予便利。（三）問，英國對遠東匯款情形如何？答，在香港已通匯，不久擬展至上海。（四）問，前傳英國擬貸華五千萬英鎊進行情形若何？答，未進行，因目前英國亦不甚寬裕也。（五）問，英國擬參加調停中國戰局吾？答，不參加。本人對馬歇爾將軍及司徒大使之堅忍努力，極爲欽佩，外籍人士中調停此事，馬司實最理想。但內爭惟中國人民自身始能加以遏止，馬帥，司使僅能協助而已，（六）問，中國政府曾提及有關香港之交涉否？答，從未。（七）問，請賂述大使過去經歷，答·先在保加利亞，後至西班牙，適逢內戰慘烈，忙於撤退英僑，一九四〇年隨艾頓氏及參謀總長狄爾將軍等作地中海之遊，其時德國侵略危機頗亟，此行先後經歷埃及，希臘，土耳其等國，希臘抗德之心，因此行而益堅。艾頓氏後與南斯拉夫之折衝，允獲成效。本人其後亦曾與蒂托元帥會談。大使繼笑稱：「生平業績，如此而已」！（八）問。在中·英商約簽訂前，兩國間究竟有無重大問題存在？答·即有問題，亦皆係屬於國內性，而非國際性者。英國在華各種企業之現狀，皆未能令人滿意，本人亟願將此局面加以改善，但能吾成功，現尙難說。本月廿日乘艦抵京〔中央社南京九日電〕英國新任太平洋艦隊司令包毅德中將，英第十九驅逐艦艦隊隊長蒲斯萊上校，分業巡洋艦貝爾法斯帶及驅逐艦特拉法爾加號，定九月廿日訪問我首都，正式拜會我政府當局，並向蔣主席致敬。</p>

<h3>原擬運華之鋼軌　聯總竟改進南國　美參議員白列琪向國務院抗議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕共和黨參議員白列琪，今日向國務院抗議，反對聯總決定將原擬運往中國價値四萬五千美元之鋼軌，改運南斯拉夫，白氏吿報界稱：渠並要求聯總解釋此舉，現有船隻載運被南斯拉夫擊落之美國人屍體渡洋返國，一面又有其他船隻，載貨前往南斯拉夫，一若並無事故發生。據渠所接報吿，馬歡爾元帥於三月間設法使是項鋼軌宣佈爲陸軍工兵隊之剩餘物資後，聯總始獲得之，且聯總於接掌獲得是項鋼軌之任務時，從戰爭物資管理局獲得特殊優先權，並有一項諒解，即鋼軌將運中國，不運他處，一面着手凍結一切可以獲得之物資，但至八月七日，計劃已有改變，聯總獲得之一〇，七八九噸鋼軌及附屬品中，共有八，二一五噸，已指定運往南斯拉夫，其價値爲三三七，三四八美元。當時，倉庫中尙有二，五三八噸鋼軌已指定運往中國，價値一一二，六六一元，未幾，顯已發令將此二，五八三噸之鋼軌亦改運南斯拉夫。其後，渠聞聯總曾設法在歐洲之美方剩餘物資中，覓取鋼軌，供給中國，但未獲顯著之成功。聯總　長賴伽第亞曾於七月間下令除必要糧食外一切物資停止運往中國，然白氏謂渠不信因有此停運令始將鋼軌改運南斯拉夫，因渠接報，下令將鋼軌改運者，乃聯總工業復興司之南斯拉夫代表。美國海員現正罷工，故若干鋼軌可能尙未運出，果爾，渠希望國務院或聯總採取行動，阻止其運出云。</p>

<h3>上海市政的興革</h3>
<p>上海市首屆參議會，昨日揭幕於逸園，在議長潘公展氏主持之下，各參議員對本市政設施應興應革諸端，必將有熱烈的研討。同時市政當局所公布的整理中區交通辦法，亦於昨日宣告實施；此後市中區交通雍塞的情况，料可大有改進。我們於此際對上海市政來作一番檢討，要非無益。</p>
<p>首先我們得指出勝利一年來之上海市政，雖不能盡如上海市民的理想，但一年來市政當局確實努力在幹。目前上海市的許多問題，論其性質，不全是上海一市的問題，實與全國大局有不可分的關迎。經濟方面的問題，其由於法幣價値的變動而引起的，原非市政當局片面能够完全圓滿解決；即如交通運輸等問題，情形亦復相同。這些問題的解決在面而不在點，只要全面能够有解決的辦法，則一市一點的問題，當不難迎刃而解。所以出現在上海市的許多問題，我們似乎不能獨望市政當局能够完全解決；只有在純市政的範略以內，這纔是市政當局的職責。自吳市長就職以來，在短短的幾個月時間內，他在此方面的努力和成就，應該値得我們的讚似。不過上海淪陷八年，此番山河重光，情形已非昔比。作爲次殖民地象徴的租界，如今因爲我們八年的苦戰而消滅了。今日的上海，我們有完全統一的市政；此後上海市政的興廢，不特有關市民的福利，抑且有關國際的視聽，足以影響我國的國際地位。所以我們對於上海市政，關注自然特別殷切。</p>
<p>上海市在收復的當初，因爲情形特殊，所以市政機構及組織，往住因時因地權宜變通，未能盡符中央法令規定。與市長自接任以來，即致力於此方面的整頓；副市長的裁撒，總務處的歸併，都在使上海市政機構如何能符中央的規定。不過到現在爲止，上海市政機構，似猶未能盡符中央的法令標準，其因情形特殊非保留不可者，應通過市參議會，請求中央變更法令規定，俾其富於彈性，各市因地方情形的不同得有伸縮的餘地。否則，市政府應迅予改變現在的內部組織，庶幾中央法令不致成爲具文。抗戰旣吿勝利，我們應該以法治來建國，萬不可再站在法律以外。</p>
<p>講到目前的上海市政，其最爲上海之恥辱的，當爲交通的　塞與凌亂。今市中區固有整頓交通辦法的實行，據我們的觀感所及，此整頓本市交通的辦法依舊沒有觸到問題的中心。這問題的中心是什麼？這就是上海市地區旣大，人口允多，而公共車輛數目又太少，所以各種各式的車輛都在狹窄的馬路上擠來擠去。戰前英商中國公共汽車公司的車輛，如今在上海市絕跡了；無軌電車的路線减少了不少；電車的車輛也少了許多。市民因爲要解決「行」的問題，所以有三輪車，人力車，馬車，老虎車，吉普車。只要公共車輛儘量加多，其它車輛的數目就會减少。國父於衣食住之外加上一個「行」字，而「行」在今大的上海却最是成問題的。上海本來有頗稱便利的公共交通系統，那時的市政，還沒有統一。現在市政旣吿統一，更應該着眼在整個上海，規劃並建立健全的公共交通系統。對於交通，我們希望市政當局能够多做一些積極的工作，少作一些消極的取締。</p>
<p>至於市政上其它應與應革的事，所在多是，我們不必一一列舉。市參議員來自民間，對於民生疾苦，知之甚深，對於市政應與應革諸端，自必早有計議。此次集會，聞有提案三百餘件，可見市政方面所應採取的措施，正復不少。我們要特別提出的，就是上海是一個具有國際性的都市，凡有措施，一面須不背我立國的精神，同時允須顧全國際性，庶幾上海市的地位能夠繼續發發展下去，能爲我們三民主義的建國，樹一地方自治的楷模</p>
<h3>五人會將流產嗎？</h3>
<p>共黨發言人王炳南昨日警吿稱：如果五人小組果眞流產，則國共雙方最後終將決裂，美國在中國之調解亦終歸失敗。這是美國合衆社南京電的報吿。</p>
<p>由於王炳南的警吿，我們本來尙寄若千期望於此五人小組的，也不禁要懷着五人會流產的恐懼了。</p>
<p>據我們所知，國共爭執的重點，原先在於軍事問題，即軍隊的整編統編，共軍從若干地區內撤退，以及雙方實行停戰等等。政府的意思，原主實行這些事項，然後可以商談政治問題，實行政協的一切決議。而共黨則堅決反對。於是司徒大使建議於馬帥，並徴得共黨代表的同意，改換步驟，先來談妥國民政府的改組問題，以爲只要國府能够改組，容納了共黨和其它黨派參加，則此後一切爭議便可在此至高無上的國府委員會裏去會議取決，調人能事可謂盡其大半，中國和平統一也就有光明希望。司徒大使前此六上廬山，專爲此事向蔣主席作誠懇的建議；也終於得到了蔣主席的同意，乃欣然下山，有所部署，有所商洽。司徒大使當然格外高興，增加了樂觀。政府方面吳鐵城張厲生兩代表也曾赴牯請示，回京準備商討。「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村；」我們老百姓更寄以莫大的期望。</p>
<p>詎知周恩來首先要對人們說，這不過是「嘗試」，後來又堅持須先談先決條件，此所謂先決條件者即與實際行動相背的無條件停戰的濫調而已。我們一聽這種濫調，就感覺前途不妙。現在王炳南果然又大喊着，果眞流產便要決裂，便要調解失敗這種警吿了。老實說罷，大槪中共原來並無誠意於商談成功的！</p>
<p>共黨本來以爲國府改組問題，政府必不願意先談的，故向司徒大使建議，先談這個問題來難住政府，使政府負擔這不能和平商談的資任。迨政府表示願意商談，乃計無所出，又回到老路上的先決條件了。他們兜來兜去轉圈子，無非不要國共爭讓得有解決之一日，無非不要中國政局得有和平統一之一日，更無非有使中國內部的爭端不因美國的居間調解而有妥協平息之一日。</p>
<p>王炳南的話，使中共的心事，正如司馬昭之心，路人皆知的了。他們惟一的希望，就是：美國在中國之調解終歸失敗。他們因美國之調解失敗，可以存着三種僥倖的想法：（一）即是美國動了意氣，退出中國，不再管遠東的事；（二）共黨可以放手與國民政府大打特打，打出一個分裂的中國來；（三）在這個美國退出而成爲「眞空」的中國大陸，可能由蘇聯的勢力來塡補。</p>
<p>共黨切望五人會流產的心事，我們早經看明白的，但和平老人的馬帥司使却還不十分相信。其實美國朋友中比較熱諳中國情形與共黨眞面目的人們，如美國對華政策協會的鮑威爾先生，魯斯夫人，和楚德參議員等，也說穿不止一次了。最近他們根據三月十二日中共中央政治局第十六號文吿，揭發中共的陰謀，更見具體了。我們要請中外人士大家注意：五人會如果流產，那是中共蓄意使它流產的，而中國大局不能和平的責任，也是應由共產黨負的。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕六國外長昨夜在法總統皮杜爾之書齋中，舉行會議，出席英代表海相亞曆山大，外次麥克尼爾，蘇外長莫洛托夫，外次維辛斯基，美國務卿貝爾納斯，參議員范登堡，康納利，法總統兼外長皮杜爾，外部總務司長經維爾，中國外長王世杰，及比外長即聯合國大會主席史巴克。中、蘇、法、比、四國政府正式提議：聯合國下屆大會延期至本年十月廿三日召開，（原定本月廿三日召開）。會中決定由史巴克立即以延期開會之決定，由長途電話通告紐約聯合國機構秘書長賴依，並授權史與各國代表接洽。昨會議至深夜一時始散，與會各代表不時以電話向本國政府請求，致會議時告中輟。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕此間消息靈通人士稱：四外長決議將丁一國和會現在對前敵國草擬之和約，提交聯合國大會，並開始草擬對德奧之和約。官方人士稱：美國巳發表文告，申明不反對外長決議。英方暫時造成大會展期之要求，但不採取最後行動，以待英外相貝文之指示，因貝文巳返倫敦出席巴基＝勒斯坦會議。外長會議致聯合國機構秘書長賴依之電文，巳發往紐約州成功湖畔賴依之總辦公處。按中、蘇、法、比四國擁擠此舉。</p>
<p>〔聯合社慕尼黑八日電〕貝爾納斯在巴伐里亞休假兩日後，今日下午乘機飛巴黎，繼續參加四外長會議。貝氏之顧問稱：貝氏以爲展期一事，應由五十一國代表多數表決，不應由四強獨斷。</p>

<h3>四強昨秘密會議　討論義南繮界問題　和會難題重重尚等解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎九日廣播：今日四強舉行秘密會議，討論義南邊境問題。苟四強能獲致協議，則衆料對義政治及委員會當能予以接受。據一般推測，四台最後將同意法國所擬之界綫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎八日電〕廿一國和會進入第七週，國際惡感巳到達最高峯。關於特港及義南邊界之決定，尚須經過一番爭執。保加利亞對於希臘色雷斯西部之要求，亦更增嚴重。此兩大巴爾幹邊界問題，在義保和約政治領土委會中，巳使蘇聯領導之斯拉夫集團與西文各國發生衝突。兩委會將於星期一繼續開會。此外匈捷間關於匈牙利斯拉伏加及奧地利多瑙河交界處附近之邊界爭持，亦巳敖週初和會議程，益以匈牙利籲請阻止羅馬尼亞驅逐二十萬匈人出境，均足以引起激辯。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎八日電〕外界人士巳有稱巴黎委員會僅係一「橡皮圖章」者。事實上四強業巳成立協議之各款，欲在委員會中予以重大之修改，頗覺困難，蓋修改某項建議可必需之多數，殊不足以敵四強之聯合陣綫也。四強所未協議之廿六點，其中最棘手者如特港問題，迄猶懸而未決。就量的方面而論，以芬蘭政治委會最有成就。</p>

<h3>南軍阻礙交通　盟國提出抗議</h3>

<h3>市參議會大會開幕　席議員一百六十四人空氣和諧　上午討論議事規程下午市長報吿　今日聽取警察衛生報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市第一届市參議會昨日上午九時假復興中路逸園　店二樓舉行第一次大會，到議長潘公展及參議員共一百六十四人，曁市府首長與市長等十餘人·列席旁聽者有候補參議員及各報社記者來賓等數十人。大會共收到提案三四一件·會塲佈置節單壯嚴，小型黨國旗　揚室內。主席台坐南朝北，參議員席次分設三方向，記者席及旁聽席分列主席台左右兩廂。九時正行禮如儀後，潘議長報吿此次會議原定爲一星期，茲因時間上不够充份，已決定改為兩星期。關於會議日程，除印就分發外，再由秘書長項昌權氏誦讀一遍，項氏　畢，舉行抽　規定各參議員席次，由副議長徐寄廎氏一一代抽後，俟下午第二次會議起即按照抽定席次入座。十時正會議正式開始，上午日程爲討論議事規則議事日程審査會組織等草案，及選舉參政員。議事規則係參照省參議會議事規則而訂定，共三十五條，先由秘書長宣讀一遍後，復由議長逐條朗誦，各議員隨時提出意見修正，發言甚爲熱烈，其中並刪削第三十四條「本會之議案詢問案及其他文件由秘書長呈請主席核准後始得發表」，另增添一條「本規則未盡事宜徴用民權初步條例」。繼即討論議事日程，有若干參議員提議延遞選舉參政員，經付表決結果，以七十九票對五十九票否決。議事日程通過後，討論審査委員會名單草案，各參議員對於小組數量及各組人選發表意見甚多，有人主張增設糧食交通房租三特種審査委員會，但贊成者僅二十二票，未能通過。最後決定審査委員會人選，按照名單草案如右意見者可於下午第二次大會前提出。時已中午十二時，經大多數贊成後，主席宣吿散會，選舉參政員改於下午舉行。</p>

<h3>下午續開二次會議</h3>
<p>下午三時正，續開第二次會議，由議長宣佈開會後，秘書長項昌權氏誦讀上午紀錄，於是開始補行選舉參政員，此係上午不及舉行，延至下午者。若干參議員主張提名介紹，若干參議員表示反對。表決結果，反對提名者，以九十票通過。（選舉情形見另稿）潘議長乃請吳市長出席報吿。</p>
<h3>市長施政報吿　糧食登記出毛病　糙米政策竟失敗</h3>
<p>吳市長於熱烈鼓掌聲中，起立報吿稱：今日能出席參議會深感愉快，現在所報吿者，乃係補書面報吿之不足。中國無論政治及任何方面，欲達民主之道，負行政責任者，必須忠實報吿，更須忠實報吿施政錯誤之處。故現將三月來施政之錯誤，及此後應做之方針，報吿如次：</p>
<p>三月來有二大缺點：（一）對現代上海情形隔膜，（二）各種施政，多爲應付臨時緊急事件。茲將報吿分爲兩部份。第一部份，三月來應付緊急事件之揹置，第二部份，市政各部門施政之方針。</p>
<p>關於前一部份，首係糧食問題。第一，爲舉辦糧食登記錯誤，辦法固對，結果却出毛病。蓋登記有重複現象。米行·米號·碾米廠，及倉庫皆同時登記。登記結果，上海存糧達四五十萬擔，足敷二月之需，但實際僅廿餘萬擔，故六月底七月初乃有黑市風潮。急請行政院·糧食部予以援助，並電呈主席，速運川米來滬，本市米潮始吿解決。第二，係糙米政策失敗。糙米營養確較佳，惟上海市民素食白米，故未能行通。對於中等食米，市府有壓抑之能力，決不令其漲價，市府擁有大量糙米，隨時可拋售。至於白粳則採議價，糧食部運來台灣米及巴西米，必要時，亦將拋售，以維白粳價格，至九月底，米價或有下跌可能。</p>
<p>工潮</p>
<p>其次係工潮問題。工潮乃戰後世界一般現象。政府政策爲勞資合作，增加生產。資方維持勞方正當生活，勞方遵守資方規定紀律。關於工資之原則，爲底薪不加，依生活指數調整，唯前市府已有增加底薪之事，市府對工潮，先加調解，繼而仲裁，仲裁結果，勞資雙方必能接受。</p>
<p>房荒</p>
<p>第三即房荒問題。因素有三：一為人口增多，本市戶籍調査雖僅三百七十萬人，但據佔計，足達五百萬人之多。二爲房屋减少，戰時被炸毀及破壞之房屋甚多。三爲非法佔據。四爲非法租賃。其必然之結果即建築减少，因大房東無利可圖，築屋尙不及放比期，關於此點甚盼諸參議員多多指示。目前市府方針爲（一）取締非法佔據，（二）取締二房東及頂費，（三）鼓勵建築。</p>
<p>竊盜</p>
<p>第四為碼頭竊盜問題。由於歷史關係，本市碼頭管理極不統一，而　結亦即在此。事權不統一，百弊乃叢生。欲求澈底管理本市港務，必須求得統一，完全歸上海市政府統轄。</p>
<p>觀市　　　　　門一作扼要報吿·略謂復員以來，市府編制及預算均未確定，一切不易入正軌。市府現已決定全部人員，不得超過前法公董局，前工部局，前市府之總和爲原則·關於社會部門，工潮已報吿。救濟事業，社局正積極辦理，深盼各位參議員熱心倡導。關於警察方面，目前之困難爲人數不够，本市警察現僅一萬二千人，至少須增至）萬五千人。</p>
<h3>今日議程</h3>
<p>市參議會今日上午舉行第二次會議，由警察局長宣鐵吾報吿，下午舉行第三次會議，由衛生局局長張維報吿·</p>
<h3>市立學校數量少　私立學校收費多</h3>
<p>關於敎育問題，本市敎育經費已由百分之九酌增至百分十九。目前兩大困難係市立學校太少，私立學校收費過昂。關於工務，目前急要工程計有兩項，一爲搶條海塘。二爲防水工程，市府皆已撥付巨款，且成立都市計劃委員會，急謀改進。關於公用，最困難者爲交通問題，現謀以私人資本發展交通。關於地政，將加速完成土地登記，減低地價稅，保障人民產權。關於衛生，努力防疫，及解決淸潔問題。關於民政，利用保甲，完成戶口調査，及協助辦理淸潔事宜。關於財政，三十五年度市府預算相差三百億，如何彌補，以求平衡，亟待諸參議員貢獻意見。目前財政大半依靠娛樂捐，殊不合理。最後吳市長對淸査團淸査市府處理偽中央市塲四十億物資案有所聲明。對於淸査團淸査帳目極表歡迎，並歡參議會淸查云。</p>
<h3>蔣建白　金振玉　當選參政員　議決滬市名額　要求增至九人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參政員陶百川，奚玉書，因專任參議員，而辭去參政員後，其遺缺己於昨日下午在市參議會大會中選出蔣建白（一〇七票）及金振玉女士（八十三票兩人）選舉採取不提名介紹式，經沈春暉，汪竹一，朱亞揆，朱文德等四議員監票，開票後，復有陳保泰，水祥雲，周學湘等十五參議員臨時動議，請市政府轉呈中央酌量增加本市參政員名額，若按人口比例，重慶市一百三十一萬人口有參政員四人，則上海市應有九人。經前參政員陶百川解釋，選舉參政員有三標準：（一）以人口爲比例（但非絕對標準）。（二）有省參議會者則佔額較多。（三）淪陷區城市其名額較內地者爲少。但此係按戰時規定，現東北各省參政員人數己增加，上海市規定名額當亦可修改，要求增加，亦有理由，結果議決要求加至九人請市政府電呈中央請示·</p>

<h3>本市下半年度預算　行政經旨力求緊縮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市下半年度預算政策，在先求市容恢復。凡關於修建道路，橋樑，及維持治安之警務，曁建國之基本敎育文化，衛生等事業，均盡量放寬。至於行政經費，則力求緊縮，對各單位與本年度施政方針，無急切關係者，則儘量裁併，以節公帑。對於歲人方面，以本市現行開征之各項稅捐爲主。惟以本市收復伊始，急須舉辦者甚多，教收支不敷甚鉅。爲求收支平衡起見，自應根據中央量入爲出之原則，另擬調整辦法，新擬捐稅增加歲入。</p>
<p>本年下半年度歲入，計列普通歲入經常門八百四十七僮一千七百五十二萬一千八百元。其中現行征收各項歲人爲五百〇一億九千〇三十六萬三千〇一十五元。賒情收入十二億元，另列新增捐稅調整歲入爲三百三十三億二千七百十五萬八千七百八十五元，以適應事業需要。其調整辦法，另案擬定。並擬俟提請市參議會審議決定後，實行征收。</p>
<p>本年下半年度歲出，分普通歲出，及事業歲出二大類。普通歲出，計分經常臨時兩門。經常門計列五十九億〇四百六十四萬三千〇十元。括預備金十五億元。臨時門計列七百八十三億〇三百八十七萬八千七百九十元，包括生活補助費四百四十六億五千〇二十萬四千七百元。事業歲出計列公有營業基金五億〇九千元。</p>
<p>本市下半年度稅課收入，佔總歲人百分之八十强。其中列五十億以上者，有營業稅，筵席稅及娛樂稅三種。廿億元以上者，有地價稅，房捐，屠宰稅，旅棧捐四種。</p>
<p>本年下半年度總預算支出，以工務經費佔總預算百分之二十一點二四，保警支出佔百分之二十點九三，敎育文化支出佔百分之一十九點一七，衛生支出佔百分之一六點〇七，等四項爲最鉅，亦即本市目前急需舉辦之各種事業。</p>
<h3>亂　希望今後多多注意　陶百川指出九種亂狀　議員紛提質詢　市長答覆三點</h3>
<p>吳市長報吿市府施政後，各議員紛紛提出書面質詢，共計四十五件。惟因時間有限，市長就必須以口頭答覆之三問題先行解答：（一）柴子飛問：本市與江蘇省的劃界問題，進行至若何程度？該部份地區劃歸本市以後，對於本市財政治安各方利弊如何？在劃界問題未解決以前，各局己先在各該地區內辦理敎育。民政等事業，用意何在？市長答稱：關於省市劃界問題，江蘇省曾派員來滬觀察兩决，但並無具體結果，現己再度兩陳催促，俟省府處理劃淸後，以後本市財政治安等各項工作，當可積極推進。</p>
<p>（二）柴子飛問：巾小學徴收尊師金，其中一部份需解交市府，於尊師意義，似有不合，市府當局曾予考慮及此否？市長答：中小學尊師金乃爲增加學校班次之用，原應歸市府。但在名義上言，中學係取增加學費，小學採尊師，其名義曾經考慮多次，如不合適，可加修改。市校敎職員待遇按中央規定，應與公務員相同。</p>
<p>（三）章祝三問：市政公報內第二項處理工潮辦法內第五款規定廠方與勞方應舉行工廠會議，三月以來實行之程度如何？假如有一方而不遵照執行應如何處理？市長答稱：工廠會議乃根據工廠法，旣係中央規定，自應嚴格執行，但種種問題，雖有法令，在上海往往朱能實行到底，三月以來，市府對此案亦未實行完善，以後市府各項法規，均由參議會審核，俟決定以後，當依法辦理。</p>
<p>其他質詢案件中較積極者：有侯寄遠問：上海市政府接收物資管理處對每一幢房子（指數人方　　　　　小　商店）有　　　　　　言　元　二百萬元，敬問塵理置三字作用，解釋，此項　理費又將作何用途？陶百川表示：本人對市政之印象，一年來總袪除不了一個「亂」字，一早出門，馬路交通亂，市塲情形亂，工廠亂，學校亂，市府編制迄未決定也是亂，財政無政也是亂，一年來兩易市長，也是亂，中央在滬機關林立，也是亂，接收情形更屬亂七八糟，如此下去，何以得了，希望市長在亂字上多多注意，未識已注意到否？張學濂提：市長對於民衆能否再接近一些，譬如區長從速由區民選任，區長爲當地人，市長接近區長，不啻隨時與民衆接近，不但可以完成自治，且可减少隔膜。楊撫生提：市府對於前僞政府之財產，其拍賣程序及估價手續如何處理？施宗德間：此次取締攤販所沒收之物資數目多少？如何處置？顧錦藻提：碼頭竊風愈烈，固由於港務權不能集中管理，惟緝私人員不能奉公守法，受賄習常，已成公開事實，善後應有切實辦法。童囊問：上海市政府接收舊兩租界曾否　辦正式收回手續，以及正式移交兩租界之產業？王乃　·陳高　問：上海市　　　　公司在市府組織系統上係屬何種性質，其主要業務爲何！</p>
<h3>改善交通　第一天　車如流水馬如龍　大呼小呌仍是亂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市嚴重的交通問題，一向是市民最感痛苦和市政當局最感棘手的問題，窄狹的街道旣不能立刻拓寬，架空和隊道一時又不易興建，這二十萬車輛如何安排呢！當局在無辦法中想出個改善辦法，雖不能盡善盡美，然也稍可差强人意。經過了幾星期的籌劃和準備，改善交通昨天開始了，警察局動員了全部交通警察和義務警察參加指揮交通，尤其是南京東路，簡直是三步一崗，五步一哨，金邊帽三顆金星的警官，不斷的來去巡邏。汽車電車啣頭接尾小心翼翼地向前移動，確是秩序井然。但是幾處車輛擁擠著名的地方，如日昇樓，拋球塲，白渡橋，泥城橋·依舊車如流水馬如龍，大呼小叫一團糟。幾條單程交通馬路，如九江路，漢口路，四川路，在上下寫字問，以及午後三四時車輛最旺盛的時候，一路望去宛如一字長蛇陣，有時候交通警察也爲之手足無所揹，如行人不在劃定的黃綫中間通過，汽車不在白綫上停止，這在在都是增加交通上的困難，此外更如人力車三輪車找不到停車的地方，因爲新交通規則不允許空車亂停亂放，於是不少空車雜在車流中擠軋，人力車被警察拿去了坐墊，還不知犯了什麽規。六時以後車少了，單程的開放了，警察和車夫這才大家鬆下一口氣來，霓紅燈下二十萬車輛照舊奔騰飛駛，第一天改善交通是過去了。且看今天第二天巴！</p>
<h3>交通警察忙作一團</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕改善中區交通辦法，自昨日零時起實施，警察總局交通科負責人全體出動督道，黃浦老閘兩分局各增添交通警一百二十人，新成分局增三十人。又警察局行政處處長方志超曾於昨日下午親赴中區視察，因昨日爲實施之第一天，行車者多不習慣。故情形仍未免稍嫌混亂。</p>
<h3>兩漢奸判決　陳伯華　趙鈺分別處刑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨宣判兩漢奸嫌疑案。（一）歷任僞交通部駐滬辦事處副處長。僞社會部參事。僞兩路特別黨部常務委員等職之陳伯華，處有期徒刑三年六月。（二）密探趙鈺，處有期徒刑一年四月。同日審結偽肥皂燭業同業公會理事長戚惠昌，僞上海市保田委員會徐家匯區分會主任委員徐聲揚及仇叔賢等案，均定十六日宣判。</p>
<p>又調査多起：（一）敵軍管理恒產公司經理陳紹嬀，將盟國在滬財產獻敵，並代敵以賤價收購房地產。（二）僞上海監獄代理典獄長沈關泉，將囚犯運往寗波四礁山代敵建築工事，因而病死殘廢者甚多。並盜賣獄內工部局所遺之大批物資。沈供係奉命而行。昨特提已被判無期徒刑之僞司法行政部長吳頌皋作證詢問。（三）前本市東方申曲塲老闆·敵憲兵隊密探長陶中立。僞上海市普陀警察分局探員薛有文，陷害我地下工作人員及偽警張一峯張連生顧金根等案，詢問一過，均改期再訊。</p>

<h3>七十六號水祥雲　別名巧同金素琴</h3>
<p>潘議長身穿灰綢長衫，端座主席台上，笑容可掬，摺　時揮，態度從容不迫，有某報記者說：「很有些像　　亮」。</p>
<p>議長逐條朗　議事規則時取下眼鏡，遇有參議員起立發言，再行帶上，帶上復取下，取下復帶上，統計在二十次以上。</p>
<p>副議長徐寄廎代各參議員抽　排定席次，共抽一百七十五次，頻頻以手帕抹去手汗。</p>
<p>參議員發言規定須先報吿號碼及姓名，但發言者大多忽略這手續，第一個報吿的是水祥雲氏，他的號碼却是「七十六號」·</p>
<p>選舉參政員前，有人在塲內大發蔣建白和金振玉的名片。金振玉是奚玉書的夫人，名片上還印着別號素琴。某報記者說：「有一位唱戲的不也叫金素琴」？</p>
<h3>會場花絮</h3>
<p>蔣建白以一〇七票　振下以八十三票當選參政員，落選的第一名是　聯　四十六票。有人選顏惠慶一票，也有人選　金榮徐車呆谷一票。</p>

<p>市長報吿足足一小時零五分，報吿時以手　頭　在十次以上。</p>
<p>參議員對市政府提出的書而質問達四十件之多，火會　　長項　　逐件　　時，市長向公用局趙局長借火柴抽烟一枝狀甚悠閒，似已「胸有成竹」</p>
<p>參議員中第一個發言的是馬君碩，新聞界參議員中第一個發言的是張志韓，女參徊議中祗有陸惠民一人。</p>
<p>議塲座位桌上各有筆架一，硯台一，墨一，毛筆一，鉛筆一，永盂一，如果沒有烟缸一只，倒很有些像老塲。</p>
<p>昨日下午選舉參政員時，奚玉　第三女公子奚耀小姐特出席旁聽，聞及乃母當選參政員，欣　不已。</p>
<p>大會開始前，市參議會發給每人牛皮紙大封袋一只，內臟印　　，很覺方便。</p>
<p>徐寄廎揮汗捕籤　顧竹軒大呼肚餓</p>
<p>會塲主席台旁大　琴一只，並不搬走，秘書處人員利用它做寫字台，倒是「廢物利用」。</p>
<p>市參議員赴會時大都乘坐汽車，新舊車輛形形色色，皆停在逸園廣塲中。然參議員中亦有乘電車及徒步前往者</p>

<h3>證交昨舉行開幕禮　中央及本市長官致詞勗勉　股票及債券分成兩個市場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籌備五月有餘之上海證劵交易所，昨最終於在熱烈隆重之氛圍下，正式舉行開幕典禮。九時許，經濟部王部長，吳市長，中央銀行且總裁，銀行公會理事長李馥蓀等，先後蒞臨。由證交理事長杜　，兼代總經理王志莘等，親自招待。當即召集全體理着事及重要職員，由各出席長官即席訓話。席間首由證交理事長杜鏞致歡迎詞，王部長，吳市長貝總裁，李馥蓀等，先後致詞。十時卅分散席後，全體長官及重要來賓，分由杜鏞王志莘等，領導參觀市塲及各處設備。時各界來賓及各經紀人等，均已陸續蒞臨。本報特於簽名處，分贈每位來賓本報一份。惟以來者踴躍，不一刻，即分發一空，市塲中之交易櫃，經紀人電話座，行市板等種種設備，莫不煥然一新；與熙來攘往之賀客，相映成趣。是時塲中空氣，頓呈空前之熱烈。十一時許，各長官及貴賓等，分別辭退。迨近午時光，塲中賀客，始陸續散去。茲分誌各畏官及來賓致詞如後：</p>
<p>杜理事長致歡迎詞</p>
<p>今年五月間，政府鑒於上海證券交易市塲亟需籌備建立，派錢新之徐寄廎，徐維明，顧善昌，夏屛芳，瞿季剛，俞寰澄，王志莘八人和鄙人組織上海市證券交易市塲籌備會籌設上海證券交易所茲已正式成立。惟因時間關係，未能如預期之盡善。本所所負使命，極爲艱鉅，政府及社會所期望於本所者，亦極殷切，當前之急務，即於開業之後，希望能誘導游資，逐步納入市塲，證券價格，漸趨穩定，此項初步任務之完成，有待於政府各主管官署之督導，及各界之協助合作。總之：本所市塲之主旨，是制止投機之活動，獎掖資本之集中，今後本所必須配合國策，完成任命，本人可保證，必竭力督率同仁，向此途邁進不懈</p>
<p>由監督進展到自治</p>
<p>王部長致詞：證券交易所爲澈頭澈底之經濟組織，英美交易所採取自治的法治組織制，歐洲大陸交易所則採取政府監督的法治組織制。我國政府政策，暫取監督辦法。候將來證交基礎鞏固，辦法改進，再走上自治之道。望證交當局及經紀人方面，實行法治精神，俾證交克底於成，使上海證交，成爲全國各地交易所之模範。</p>
<p>穩定金融安定民生</p>
<p>吳市長致詞政府對經濟施策，現有兩火目標，即穩定金融，及安定民生是。證交如要辦得好，需能帮助政府迷到些二目標。證交各位理監事經協理等，均爲各界領袖，望重一時故深信證交必能辦得好，謹代地方致祝賀之忱。</p>
<p>慎選證券　密切聯絡</p>
<p>只總裁致詞：證交功用，在領導游資，扶助工商企業，功用頗大。故望證交今後注意兩：（一）對上市證券，應愼重選擇。（二）已上市證券，望證交對其發行之公司，取得密切之聯絡，需多多瞭解各公司之內容。最後深望上海證交，能成爲全國各地交易所之模範。</p>
<p>扶助政府　扶助工商</p>
<p>李馥蓀致詞：證交職責　重，一方面可扶助政府，一方面可扶助工商業，故證交應善自爲之。適聆王部長談政府對證交施策，將逐步自監督，趨於放任。本人對此施策，極表欽佩。現觀世界健全完備之證券交易所，首扒紐約，次及倫敦，深望我國證交，能躍居世界證交之第三位云。</p>
<p>最後王總經理致謝詞：本所今日開幕，承各位長官，到所訓話，語多鼓勵，關切備至，非常感奮。志莘追隨杜理事長，籌備本所，草草就緒，諸多不週。又承囑咐兼代總經理之職，惟有竭盡棉力，負責主持，遵守政府法令，切實遵照各位長官訓勉各點，努力以赴。惟自審任重才淺，深恐有負期望。今後尙望多所指示，以匡不逮。茲謹代表本所同人，向各位長官表示謝忱。</p>
<p>又昨晨十一時許，證交經理陳績孫，代表杜理事長及王兼總經理，在市塲以擴音機向市塲巾向各界來賓及經紀人致詞，略稱：今日天氣炎熱，承各位光臨，不勝榮幸，惟地位有限，來賓踴躍，招待諸多不週，極爲抱歉·今日並不舉行儀式，請各位隨意參觀。現證交第一層爲股票市塲，第二層爲債券市塲，第三層爲辦公室，請各位參觀市塲及各種設備，如有不週處，請貢獻意覓，以便改善云。</p>

<h3>證交今明演習　一經紀人限三人入場　營業員規定應守規則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海證券交易所於昨日開幕後，已定於今明兩日演習，上午演習市塲交易，下午演習交割及對帳手續。如演習經過圓滿，決於十二日起，正式開拍。惟證交塲務科各工作人員，業於昨日下午，開始在市塲中演習工作。首批開拍之證券，即昨日本報批露之試行上市華股二十種。</p>
<p>證券市塲正式開拍時，每一經紀人至多僅能有三人入塲（包括經紀人，代理人，及電話員各一人）。其他人民，一槪不准入塲。至附屬於各經耙人之營業員）即俗稱證券字號及小公司等），證交亦將於日內召開理事會，加以規定。各經紀人所附屬之營業員，須向證交備案。如發現各營業員有非法行爲者，證交將通知所屬之經耙人，加以制止。否則，將對所屬經紀人，加以處分。同時，尙將商請政府協助，杜絕股票之黑市交易云。</p>
<p>又昨日下午，證交塲務科各人員，已開始在市塲上演習工作，</p>
<p>證交爲防止股票價格暴漲暴落起見，頃已規定對每一種證券，每日均有價格升降限度之規定，其規定根據下列標準，（一）股票價格在一百元以下者，升降限度爲百分之二十，（二）一百元以上至五千元以下者，爲百分之十五，（三）五千元以上者爲百分之十，每種證券之升降限度，每日將由該所於交易　前，逐日懸牌公佈所有成交價格，不得高於公佈限度之高價，或低於公佈限度之低價，如達到此項限度時，該所將停止當日該證券之買賣云。</p>
<p>證券交易所開幕（市塲內經紀人及來賓）</p>
<h3>證交開幕人心興奮　冷門小股走勢最俏</h3>
<p>華股逢證交開幕，人心興奮，尤以冷門小股最為吃香，籌碼涸竭，激漲最俏，熱股晨開均堅，後因出熱進冷，套頭較多，且逢高亦不乏獲利了結之流，時屆秋節，中途銀根見緊而見回降，冷門中小型則仍感挺勁，屹然不動，熱股亦臨收見低價，結果與上週六相較計永紗微升，美亞略低，景　勤與微穩，新光好起半成，較冷各股中型平穩而變。</p>
<p>外股逢高略回，怡紗自一〇三〇〇元起，開後盤小，餘者除紙業怡啤兩股因有申請上市之訊，尙有微漲外，均被帶低，結果較上週六計業廣鋼業拌落半成弱，怡紗英聯航業雖跌而不多，會德豐平平，怡啤紙業則漲半成左右。</p>
<p>公債徘徊</p>
<p>公債昨徘徊而已，七樓某戶來進，中途稍俏，五樓有多方了結，高後即回，統丙晨開二四五〇元，開後曾升至二五八〇元，逢高多方了結，中途又回小至二三〇〇元以下，最後在二三五〇元左右掙扎，結果較前收升一百元，甲乙微升二十元，丁則下挫五十元，統戊跌一〇〇元</p>
<h3>中秋節　行莊照常營業</h3>
<p>今日爲中秋節，木市各銀行錢莊，仍照常辦公，票據收兌亦照常交換。據悉：近日銀根較前數日微鬆，因各辦理貸款銀行日來放出之小工業貸款頗多，游資略呈活躍，故各行莊均能安渡中秋節云。</p>
<h3>健全證券市場之建立（續）</h3>
<p>— 楊蔭溥</p>
<p>乙　擴大資金來源基礎有資作長期投資者，有市塲之存在，知有隨時收回其資金之可能，投資時無所顧慮，則有多少之力量，即可以作多少之投資。使保有長期資金者，可能放手爲充分長期資金之供給，此爲其一方面。有資作短期運用者，利用市塲之存在，做證券套利，則可以得不負風險之盈利；作短期投資，亦不患需資時之無法收回。如此使社會一部短期資金亦可移以供應長期市塲之需要，此爲其另一方面。遊資散處社會，尋覓出路。見此較易獲利則就此，見彼較具活力則就彼，證券市塲所具之條件，大致頗能適應保有此種遊資者之需要。可能導引市面一部遊資，使人正當途徑，此爲其又一方面。總之，有正式市塲之存在，使不具長期性質之資金，可能流人長期市塲；使原具長期性質之炎金，可能作更充分更無顧慮之運用。擴大資金來源之基礎，所以增加資金可能吸收之數量者，其功能二。</p>
<p>丙　指示投資有效途徑健全證券市塲逐日所開出之行市，每爲投資途徑良好之指標。各種證券行市之長期趨勢，大致可視爲各該企業盛衰之反映。且交易所對上市各證券，經常有精密之調査。此項徴信材料，倘能善加利用，不無作投資時參考之價値。總之，健全市塲之行市，爲多數實際經營者具體意見之結晶，無形巾具有左右市塲投資之力量。有市塲之存在，因以獲投資途徑之暗示，從而影響投資之趨向者，其功能三。</p>
<p>三　今後多而努力之必要</p>
<p>欲證券市堪充分發揮其功能，必先求其本身機構之健全，是則有待於多方面之努力。</p>
<p>甲　健全市塲本身在此方面，應特加努力者，可舉三端：（一）市塲管理之力求周密；（二）營業水準之設法提高；（三）上市證券之愼加選擇。</p>
<p>（一）市塲管理之力求周密新市場之佈置，力求其現代化，儘可能利用機械設備，以减少塲內開做交易時之紊亂，增加營業處理及傳遞消息時之效能。過去塲內一切不合法行動，如私做塲外交易，轉輾「飛帳」，圖賴交易，代理人自做買賣，外人混入市塲，收盤時有意抬高或壓低行市等，有損經紀人之信譽，亦有損交易所之信譽，均應嚴加取締。至如經紀人會計之應時加査核，經紀人公會及經紀人之應積極協助對塲務作不斷改進等，均極爲重要。</p>
<p>（二）營業水準之設法提高協助經紀人逐漸提高其一般營業水準，使經紀人在社會之信譽，日見隆重；以負起此項調劑長期資金之鉅任。應轉移一部經紀人近利厚利觀念，使更注意於實力及信譽之培植作久遠之圖。一方在為顧客利益着想之前提下，發揮其服務精神，一方在維護券市穩定之新認識下，改變其交易作風，定能一新社會之視聽，而納證券事業於正軌。是則有待於所方之提倡，與經紀人之自覺與奮鬥者矣。</p>
<p>（三）上市證券之愼加選擇證券市塲之最重要任務，旣爲利導市而資金，使流入正當投資途徑，則設證券對象選擇不當，應加輔助之穩健正當企業，被擯門外，而富於僥倖冒險性企業所發行之證券，反充塞市塲，非特喪失創設證券交易所之本意，抑且助長投機，難逃浪費社會資力之責難。蓋上市證券種類之選擇，即爲協助企業種類之選擇。准其上市者，即可以其所發證券經由市塲以獲得其所需之資金，不准其上市者，即無法利用此融通長期資金之唯一機構。故就此方面言之，將來交易所業務發展之健全程度，可以其上市證券選擇之適常程度，爲其最正確之測騐標準。上市選擇愈見適當，則其業務發展，必可愈見健全，理有必然，勢有必至者在。</p>
<p>乙　輔導公司組織市塲交易之對象爲證券，而證券之發行賴公司。故發達公司組織，爲發達證券發達市塲之前提。有健全之公司，斯有健全之證券，斯可能有健全之市場。健全之公司愈多，斯健全之證券愈多，斯市塲健全發展之機會愈多。反之，因市塲之存在，而證券有流通之便利；因證劵有流通之便利，而公司組織，與證券發行，均獲得有效之刺激。故證券市塲之健全發展，本身即爲輔導公司組織之一重要因素。且交易所操有審核證券上市之權，運用得當，非特可以感應現存公司之一部營業政策，抑且對未來新立公司之應取途徑，不無暗示，亦即不無影響。如何利用此項間接力量，以漸導公司組織於正軌，使其內部機構，漸形嚴密；會計制度，漸見健全？財政狀况，保持流動；公司內容，漸趨公開，使確知所以獲得市塲之地位者，即所以爭取社會之信仰。對此方向，確有應加努力之可能與價值。</p>
<p>丙　提倡發行機構　交易所正式開幕後，證券買賣機構，雖吿成立；而證券於開始發行時所需要之輔助機構，至今仍付缺如。諸如公司創立時，資本之代募，公司發行股票債券時之代理，承受，或包銷，此外如對代銷證券行市之維護，對己發證券上市之協助等，應與對此方面負有特殊任務之國家金融機構，如中央信託局，交通銀行等，取得聯繫，俾資倡導。有發行機構爲企業之輔助，而證券開始發行時之困難，得以解除；有買賣市塲，代爲維護其市面，而證券經常流動能力，得以保持。兩者缺一不可，且屬相得益彰，故於此方面，亦有應加努力之需要</p>
<p>丁　矯正錯誤觀念社會一般對交易所及經紀人，每以瞭解不切，而構成錯誤觀念。如視交易所爲純粹投機塲所，爲發財機構，經紀人爲市塲投機主動者，爲謠言製造者等等，種種風傳，漸成輿論。是非賴交易所當局及經紀人努力爲事實之表白，恐不足以矯正此項根深柢固之錯誤認識於一時。此有待於特殊努力者，自更屬刻不容緩。（完）</p>
<h3>建立投資市場　王監理員之談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪財政部派駐證交之監理員王鰲堂·承吿；渠於上週六方都部令派任證交監理員之職。惟一因監理法令，及職掌規定，尙未有明文頒到，故未便無的放矢，然深信政府對證交必有一最低之企求，即望證交能成爲一之投資市塲，而非投機市塲。以便建立一健全之資本市塲，誘導社會資金，納於正當途徑。査此次主持證交人員，均屬一將之選，當能各本所長，爲工商界竭誠服務云。</p>

<h3>申請額如數照配　昨配紗仍維原價　現貸黑市昨又漲起十萬　棉布銷路復活龍頭獨呆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗廠聯合配銷委員會，於昨日下午三時，舉行第六次委員會，出席全體委員，即席議決：開售廿支棉紗標準數額二·七六三件，照申請額全配。售價以四百磅廿支雙馬爲標準，每件一百三十萬元，仍維持上次原配價。下次開售日期，以中秋例假關係，決改於十三日開售。</p>
<p>昨日紗市續向上淤，粗細紗綫一致高翔，念支現貨價格漲起三五萬，雙馬復出一百六十萬大關，最後成交一百六十二萬，人心挺秀，廿支雜牌及十六支紗銷路奇暢，四十二支因紡建迄不配給，同行貨根極一缺，致客帮及布廠需要者，乃放價搜求，價由二百卅二萬冉冉上升，以迄二百四十萬，較前日高十萬之多，卅一于支銀月有廣帮收羅，價復升至一百七十萬元，綜觀市上成交各貨，俱以現貨爲準，完全屬實銷去路，致各廠配售之期貨棧單，殊無人注意。</p>
<p>又昨日市場猜測，中紡數度開貨，均爲跳號配給，而紗號業則二星期內未曾派到一包，各紗號對於昨日派貨，咸認爲希望甚少，故人心一致向榮，兼之各帮吸胃甚濃，如申紡寬放頭寸，貨價定可接近開價，布市則以最近中紡兩次未曾盡量配售，且中秋節關，頭寸多空，俱已軋平，前日開進之金蓮妙舞　嘰，均準備塡進，後漢口帮抬價收進，差價四千二百五十元，賣方略有售出，繼漲至五千元，收進者甚夥，龍頭因銷路呆滯，並無起色，價仍站六萬四千元，五福則加五千五百元，據接近合島貿易者談，布疋市價，環球細布，外匯朱調整前，可售台幣二·六〇〇元，以匯率廿七元計，合法幣七萬零二百元，今自調整後，該地市價反跌至二千元，雖匯率好轉，而合法幣使高三千餘元，然以滬地物價論，則無利可圖。</p>

<h3>中信收購生絲　定今日起實施</h3>
<p>關於政府收買生絲一事，業已決定於今日起，付諸實施，由中央信託局收買，先以口字等級計算，每擔付三百八十萬元，交中央銀行，由中央銀行扣除該廠名下　貸　貸應還之款，餘多之款，再扣其半數，作爲秋繭貸款三成墊頭，其餘半數，發還廠商，聞第一批收買之生絲，約在四千擔左右，俟後隨到隨收隨時結算</p>

<h3>烟煤及鴻基屑　銷路漸見活躍</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊市况依然堅俏，行情穩站高峯·烟煤各貨銷路漸見活躍，據煤商業聯合營業處統計，上月份配出共僅八千餘噸，而本月份每日配出均在五六百噸之譜，製球主要原料，本月份經濟部燃委員又將配價減低一萬元後，各煤球廠均將煤球成份提高，或將售價减低，面各種液體燃料因受外匯調整影響，故提高售價，致各界用戶，採用煤球者續有增加，故各煤球廠向燃委會申請配鴻給基屑者頗爲踴躍。</p>
<h3>金價徵升美鈔徵跌　市場滿佈安穩氣象</h3>
<p>烚亦昨甚爲平穩，中途遭央行逼迫而稍有回挫，但人心仍穩，仍堪支持，晨開二一二萬五，開後即有壓力，自二一三萬起逐漸下游，退至二一〇萬五，始告平穩，微吿回升，十時後央行配給八一條，價二一二萬，此後復入穩健，銀根平定，人心向榮，午刻站二一三萬光景，午後隔日交割賡續扳高至二〇五萬以上，央行續加應付而後略平，結果較上週六再好三萬四，飾金亦好至念二萬九，紋銀平而銀元微升，暗拆息價，自一角半至一角八左右。</p>
<p>外幣平靜，形勢微現力竭，美鈔晨開三四五〇元有售，中途退至三四二〇元，此後遂始終在三四三〇元左右徘徊，毫無特變，午後金市方面不少鼓勵，前進至三四五〇元，結果較上週六微降十元，港票中途曾低至六八〇元後，又升至七〇〇元外，結果較上週六低五元，港匯亦相彷彿，印匯八二五元至八三五元，午後有買無賣，英匯一一〇〇〇元至一一五〇〇元，美匯仍站牌價左右。</p>

<h3>今年的中秋</h3>
<p>— 本報記者平齊撰文·創碩攝影</p>
<p>今年的中秋，和往年頗有不同。</p>
<p>第一，天氣奇熱，今夜一定海有許多上海人睡在人行道上，祗須稍稍轉身，便可仰望明月。</p>
<p>第二，該大書特書的，是冠生園月餅在昨天下午竟然售缺，買客排隊鵠候者很多。這個景象恐怕是多年所未有的，無論大家怎樣說民生凋敝，但是今年的購買力的確是比前幾年多少高了一點。</p>
<p>第三，我們也許可以記下幾樣物價：米，每担六萬元；最大的一隻月餅，五十萬元；普通「落盆貨」蟋蟀，每只二萬元，，和國際飯店十四棋一客晚餐的餐價正好一樣，不過這二萬塊餐費之外，還須加捐三成。</p>
<p>第四，去年以前，是海沒有吉普東；「原子老虎」之稱。</p>
<p>但是，今年的中秋，跟往年也還仍舊沒有不相同的地方。烽火處處，哀鴻遍野，也並不比以前好了多少。在「低頭思故鄉」的時候，正和往年一樣，心頭還是沉重的！</p>
<p>圖片說明</p>
<p>（一）中秋佳節到了，店舖內月餅盒堆疊得非常美術化，像摩天大樓，又像是古代堡壘！（二）上海市上新出品——最大的香斗，每隻價値五十萬元，其構造十分精巧，共分上下兩層：上層是唐明皇遊月宮，下層是濟公傳。（三）普通大香斗，索價也不便宜，實非平頭百姓所可朝貢。（四）水果花籃也是中秋節應時禮品之一種，到處鬥奇爭妍，爲的是營業競賽。</p>

<p>本欄深表贊同惟事先須籌足基金</p>
<p>逕啓者：貴報對於社會服務，倡導不遺餘力，全滬人士，實爲感動！近常聞時有急症須立即施用手術者，因以深夜送院求治，不能付現，往往躭誤病症，甚至死亡，極以爲憾！茲送上法幣二百萬元，請求貴報代辦臨時保證之辦法，以免躭誤急症，（一）凡有急症送往醫院開刀等，因深夜無法付現者，由此款作爲担保；（二）一切辦法，請貴報主持，如何通知醫院，如何儘快聯路保證等事。（三）如二百萬元不敷應用時，請予貴報社會服務欄通知「不其名」者，當即繼續送奉。（四）暫定三個月爲試辦期間。總之勞神勞力，伏祈俯允試辦爲幸。敬頌暑安。「不具名者敬啓」</p>
<p>（按）本報接得「不具名」先生之來函及捐款後，認為用意良善，値得倡導。近來旣有因病家不能付現而貽誤性命之事實，則此後確有未雨綢繆設法補救之必要。本欄同人對此曾加硏討，僉謂以上海之大，急症時有所聞，如照「不具名」先生之提議，非有二千萬元的款，實屬不易應付。爰經決定先將原函披露，盼「不具名」先生繼續徴募，同時熱心讀渚量力贊助，如能在一星期內集有成數，決即釐訂章程，尅日辦理，吾則仍將此款退還原捐款人或移作別項捐款。昔賢有言：「雖不有初，　克有終」，與其中道力有不繼，不如愼之於初，想「不具名」先生及讀者諸君，定能曲諒也。（編者）</p>

<h3>農地改革論之反響</h3>
<p>八月二十八日，地政學會所主張之農地改革一文，敝人表示不滿，今將予之理由，略述如左：</p>
<p>（一）原文謂農地改革之後，可使大多數農民，獲致安居樂業，一若農民之不能安居樂業，完全爲地主所造成者然，此眞寃哉枉也！事實吿訴我人，農民之不能安居樂業，實有下列數點原因：（一）通貨膨脹，（二）物價狂漲，（三）社會不寗，（四）苛捐雜稅，（五）農村高利貸，老實說：這幾年來善良業主之生活狀况，與彼濃民不啻五十步與百步之比，（在淪陷區域內，忠貞業主之困苦情形，更非筆墨所能形容。）眞正舒服之人，到是汚吏，奸商，與區長保長等人，今地政學會，不顧實際情形，竟將農民之不能安居樂藥，望善良業主頭上一推，豈非不公平之至。</p>
<p>（二）債券一物，信用已不如前，公債之一對一還本，即爲明證。今以土地債券徴收土地，不過美其名目，聊勝於無，事實上與沒收何異？夫通謀敵國之叛逆互奸，尙得酌留生活費用，予以優待，今對於飽受敵偽壓迫而並未發國難財，勝利財之善良業主，反欲奪其生活來源，事之不平，莫甚於此！</p>
<p>（三）永佃權之制度與二五减租之規定，對於農民已有莫大之利益，倘能减少賦稅，穩定幣値，並取消高利貸，則農民之安居樂業，固指日可待，又何必與弱小業主為難耶？</p>
<p>總之：在此世風日下，人心不古之際，多一事不如少一事，吾則徒然予中間人以發財之機會，安分守己之蕃良小業主，惟有坐而待斃，於此情形欲求社會之安寗，豈可得乎！望我賢明當局，深體民艱，則我萬民，自必感激涯已。（徐白）</p>
<p>泰興難胞的呼聲</p>
<p>編者先生：敬啓者，泰興貧民望眼將穿的救濟麵粉，遲延了數月，方得運泰。第一批發出麪粉，計大口四斤，小口二斤，不够貧民一日之糧。如此救濟，眞是杯水車薪，無濟於事！要是貧民必需賴救濟麪粉作口糧的話，人民一定要死去大半！最奇怪的，是富有資產的一戶，反得着麪粉數袋之多，貧苦的小百姅得不到麪粉的還佔多數！現聞第二批麪粉已到，聽說每人只發二斤，談起泰興救濟，實在悽慘萬分！二批兵災振款政府與地方急振，共計法幣七千萬元之巨。前據救協會登報公吿：已發出振款一千五百餘萬元，其餘之款，至今尙未知如何發落？（王洪生）</p>
<p>平民水喉已開放</p>
<p>八月三十日　貴報讀者意見欄，載有市民趙永年等請在江蘇路東諸安浜梅家橋弄裝設自來水太平龍頭一節。査江蘇路一帶埋設之水管，因口徑細小，水壓不足，出水困難，若再加裝龍頭，必使附近龍頭益受影響，故目前該區尙難裝置。惟本局爲顧全貧民飲水起見，現已通知上海自來水公司，將（一）江蘇路東諸安浜（二）中正西路（迪化路江蘇路間）（三）靜安寺路馬谷邨附近三處消防龍頭，免費開放，以應急需。即希查照刋登爲荷此致申報館。（市公用局）</p>

<p>婦女家庭</p>
<h3>愛之種種</h3>
<p>— 延娟</p>
<p>（一）愛情的重要性</p>
<p>人類生活中假如沒有了愛，好像自然界裏除去了綠色，多殺風景。人類社會中，如果把愛情枯乾了，那就像披上衣服的骸骨，像一羣羣的豺狼虎的。所以愛情對於人生，予以溫潤，予以色彩。</p>
<p>愛大概可分爲戀愛，母愛，友愛三種。這些愛情發揚而光輝，使人類生活展開多彩的繪面。所以，詩人歌詠着，全人類以各種不同的言語頌揚着，我不敢對這個深遠的複雜的愛情問題，作全般的論述，我只從生理上貢獻點意見。</p>
<p>（二）性愛與戀愛至上主義</p>
<p>性慾本能，使異性相互接近，起初，是對於異性的一種朦朧的憧憬心，漸次進入思慕，終至戀愛。</p>
<p>根據一種理想，選擇一個特有的對象，這是人類精神上的特權。動物就沒有這種選擇，只要異性，便是牠的對象。人類的戀愛，是性慾方面加以美的精神作用，所以戀愛也可分爲多種，有的陷入病理的變態，有的近乎淫蕩的遊戲，純眞的戀愛，實在是生殖上必需的事，它能使人類向上，不過，變態的戀愛，遊戲的戀愛，却足以戕賊人類。</p>
<p>戀愛至上主義者，實在就是精神遊戲的極致，他們認爲人類世界中的任何事，沒有比戀愛更尊貴更至上的，道實在是錯誤的觀念。純眞的戀變確値得尊貴，但如認爲是至高無上，耽溺其中，這完全是追求享樂的遊戲而已。在任何塲合，我們不能忘記永久的生命，即種族繁榮。</p>
<p>（三）母愛與其他愛情</p>
<p>不論母親，或父親，沒有不疼愛自己的子女的，兩親對子女的愛情，一般稱爲母性愛。母性愛和戀愛不同，但它也是源出於種族保存的本能。</p>
<p>母性愛比戀愛更純潔，戀愛中混雜着競爭和虛榮，母性愛，就沒有這種成分在內。母性愛的延長，如祖母的愛孫子，家族的相親相愛。母性愛的理想化，便養成愛鄕，愛國，博愛的精神。</p>
<p>本能的愛，如戀愛，如母性愛，只要純潔的話，則利害，名譽，地位等等，都不能左右它。但現今一般的人戀愛，常混雜了上述的成分，遊戲性的戀愛，不在少數。所以，我們對於上而所述的戀愛至上主義，實在難以贊成。</p>
<p>（四）戀愛與夫婦</p>
<p>相愛的人，要求着互相接近，永遠的共同生活，這是極自然的事。所以，戀愛與結婚，是人類的最大幸福。不過，結婚以前是戀愛的最高潮，結婚以後，戀愛往往發生破綻，這是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>因爲，戀愛這件事，基調是本能的異性相引，其他方面，還附帶着心理問題和感情問題，所以，純潔的愛情，如果有了欠缺，等到性慾發散以後，感情上自會發生種種裂痕。</p>
<p>夫婦之間的結合，千萬要由於純潔無邪的愛情。</p>
<p>（五）夫婦愛之創造</p>
<p>夫婦旣由於純潔的愛情而結合，則必須嚴守一夫一妻的制度。不過，也有人說：純潔的愛情，固是理想的東西，但人類未必都能走上理想之途。且從性慾方面觀察，男子的性慾，往往有轉移的傾向，從甲到乙，從乙到丙，以此傾向而言，一夫一婦制，反爲不自然了。</p>
<p>但這種論調是錯誤的，人類的尊貴之處，就是具有能抑制本能奔放的精神，如果人類任其自然，則與其他的動物有什麽分別呢？</p>
<p>所以夫婦之間，要保持一夫一妻制度，而相互的不斷創造純潔的愛情。</p>
<h3>去污跡法</h3>
<p>— 江烏</p>
<p>（一）藍墨水汚跡　先用炭酸鈉的溫液（一比五十）洗過，再浸入酒石酸的溫液中（一比五十）幾分鐘，更用淸永洗過，汚跡便消。</p>
<p>（二）汗汚跡　用稀薄的阿莫尼亞水（一比一千）洗滌便去。</p>
<p>（三）果汁及酒類汚跡　先用硼砂水（一比二百）洗，然後用淸水洗凈之。</p>
<p>（四）醬油汚跡，在未乾時，用肥皂水立刻洗去。若隔日稍久，可先以過錳酸鉀溶液搽上，再由淸水洗之即去。</p>
<p>（五）酸液污跡　可用稀薄之阿莫尼亞溶液塗在汚跡處，使酸性中和，再用淸水洗凈之。</p>
<h3>標準的兒童報</h3>
<p>— 真心</p>
<p>報紙是人民的精神糧食，敎育大衆的工其，改造社會的急先鋒。兒童報紙亦然，它非但可以增加兒童的智識，訓練兒童的心靈，指導兒童前進，並且還可以啓發兒童的思想，鼓勵兒童的志氣，甚至奠定兒童將來爲人的基礎。所以兒童報對兒童的關係與影響較大報對成人的關係與影響允甚。</p>
<p>兒童報旣負有這樣重大的使命，又有這樣顯著的功効，那末辦兒童報的人應該怎樣集稿。整理·編排·印刷·才能使它成爲一種標準的兒童報呢？</p>
<p>到現在，中國還沒有像樣的兒童報出現，不過據我們幾個關心兒童報紙的朋友們研究討論的結果，產生幾條相同的規則，現在披露在此，以供敎育界同志參考，並共同硏究之：</p>
<p>型式　型式如報紙，便於閱覽，面積不超過四開，便於摺展，版面不致呆板，依性質分成四版若十欄，使情調活潑而有系統，用老五號鉛字，可使字大悅目，兩行間稍空，不致擠在一堆，見而生畏，多用頭花小圖，增加文章之引力，紙張須潔白而油墨須濃顯，不致有傷目力，報頭簡單大方加以套色，增强兒童對報紙之愛好而多收效果。</p>
<p>內容時事12％，兒童新聞4％，指導5％，兒童服務2％，謎語2％，詩歌3％，笑話3％，故事8％，圖畫10％，智力測騐3％、遊記5％，劇本4％，科學知識8％，名人傳記5％，文選4％，勞作3％，遊戲3％，地方說明4％，抗戰史實4％，兒童創作8％。（這成份比例適用於三年之內）</p>
<p>文件　文章宜短小精悍簡單明瞭，多事實而少空談及理論，文句不可嚕囌拖長，文字宜用熱門字，筆劃不繁而不生，使兒童閱讀無甚困難。對時事及新聞稿件宜用兒童口吻叙述，但絕對不能有錯字別字漏字或文法不通之處。</p>
<p>照目前中國的經濟情形及家長兒童之負担能力和兒童對於兒童報的需要量來推測，這樣的兒童報紙必然爲四年級至六年級的小學兒童所歡迎，對他們也可以有實際的益處。</p>
<p>主婦須知</p>
<h3>體溫表的用法</h3>
<p>— 德齡</p>
<p>在現代的家庭裘，除了日常必備的藥品：藥棉，紗布，紅藥水等等之外，一支檢量體溫用的檢溫器—簡稱體溫表—是不可或缺的。它可以吿訴人體的溫度，身體是否健全正常。雖然亦可用手摸摸太陽穴或者手掌心，測知人體有沒有寒熱，但這是不可靠的，因爲有時您的手剛從熱水或冷水中出來，或熱或冷，不如體溫表的準確性了。一個健康者的正常體溫，不論男女老少，是有一定的，通常爲攝氏36度-37C華98.6氏度）度之間，一日之間，微有變動，夜間略低，日中略高，然其間之差，不出一度以內，若體溫在36度以下或37度以上，皆屬病象。</p>
<p>體溫表除口腔應用的一種之外，尙有肛門的一種，小孩適用，檢量體溫的功用是一樣的。在平日可以常常檢騐體溫，藉知人體健全與吾。在病時，每隔三小時檢騐一次，記錄下來，以備醫生的參考，了解疾病的變化，使醫生可以對症下藥，早日痊愈。</p>
<p>若不幸家庭裏的一份子生了病，從他的體溫記錄中，可以推測生那一稱疾病。假使熱度歷三四天不退，常在攝氏三十八度左右，是屬傷寒症類。體溫高達三十九度，鮮有上下變動，而鼻孔閃氣，是屬肺炎等症……病者體溫隔三小時檢量一次，經三次撿量，均已正常在攝氏三十七度，大體沒有大毛病，病體行將復原，注意飲食，毋需再麻煩醫診治了不過微溫表每次使用之後，應該用藥棉醮些酒精，拭一拭消毒，以防病菌的傳染。</p>
<h3>家庭娛樂</h3>
<p>— 莊文治</p>
<p>我們要使家庭增進快樂，使家庭中每個份子都因快樂而减少心理上的痛苦，增進精神上的活躍，而使體魄健全，那惟有娛樂才能够達到此目的。但在我國中國社會上，尋常所習見的娛樂，倒以不正當的居多數，而歐美各國人的娛樂，大半太高貴，不是我們的環境所允許；因此我們採取折衷的辦法不論中西，把正當的而且可以辦得到的寫在下面：</p>
<p>一，書畫每天抽些餘暇，寫寫字畫畫圖，或欣賞古今中外之名書畫，確是最高尙的娛樂。</p>
<p>二，音樂　音樂可以淸人神志，如　，笛，胡琴，口琴，風琴，手風琴等，依各人所好，任意選擇一種學習。</p>
<p>三，歌唱　學習中西歌唱，任性之所好擇之，一經入門，樂趣無窮。</p>
<p>四，弈棋　棋類頗多，每天擇所好的玩上一局，裨有益於身心，但不宜過分浪費時間。</p>
<p>五，集郵　收集中外郵票，分門別類，張貼於簿上，也是家庭娛樂之一種。</p>
<p>六，攝影　出遊時，備照相機一具，攝取古蹟人像風景等，亦樂事也。</p>
<p>七，古玩　凡古代之物，皆可稱爲古物，文人雅士喜收藏之。</p>
<p>八，聚會　一家老小，或邀的同好，談談心，說說笑，講講故事，都是可以爽心怡神的。</p>
<p>九，閱讀　讀早晚報紙，新舊小說或名人傳記，每日閱讀些時，眞有意想不到的樂趣。</p>
<p>十，觀劇　上海有的是各種戲院，我們儘可以花一點錢去欣賞，多少總可以增長點知識。</p>
<p>十一，溜冰　近來海上溜冰盛行，玩法不難，所費不多，而且對於身體也是很有益處的。</p>
<p>十二，球藝　玩球宜擇不激烈者爲宜，像綱球檯球，羽毛球，高而夫球等，都頗適宜。</p>
<p>十三，國術　國術是我國固有的技術，不論在室內，空地或公園裘，都可以練習。</p>
<p>十四，園藝　家裏有花園最好，吾則在洋台上，案頭上，都可以安放若干盆花，以資點綴。</p>
<p>十五，烏獸　飼養貓犬烏魚兎鵝來玩玩，也是消遣暇時的一個好辦法。</p>
<p>十六，騎馬　花些錢租一匹馬，到四郊去奔奔也很不錯。</p>
<p>十七，駕車　駕輛自由車，摩托卡或汽車，趁日落時，到馬路上去兜兜風，也是好的。</p>
<p>十八，遠足　出外遠足確是人生最快樂的事，如果沒有多天的空暇，就是附近的幾個公國，也不妨去逛逛。</p>
<p>十九，跳舞　在現在上海的跳舞，雖然不是正當的娛樂，但如果不入迷，夫妻倆逢塲作戲，未嘗不實惠也。</p>
<p>二十，無綫電　開開無綫電，或聽聽留聲機，不過宜擇高尙的聽之，也未嘗不是有益的玩意兒。</p>

<h3>石濤和尚</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>筆頭那識視師禪，</p>
<p>寂照處空近自然。</p>
<p>但覺淋漓元氣濕，</p>
<p>不知是墨是雲烟？</p>
<p>號稱為清初四大畫僧之一的石濤和尚，「今夕　題畫絕句」的作者居巢，以這樣一首詩來謳歌這位曠古奇才的大藝人，而且把這首詩列在最前，我們可以知道作者推崇之至意，竟把一般人尊奉的四王吳惲的至高地位，予以動搖，這不得不佩服居巢見地的獨到。</p>
<p>石濤的畫，雖然可以納入於南宗的一個系統中間，可是畢竟與當時的四王吳惲，作風上表示全然的不同，石濤是不拘繩墨，縱橫恣肆地創造，清初六家只是規範宋元，規規矩矩地承受傳統技法。王太常祖孫，自己也承認不及他，烟客有云：「大江之南，無出石師右者。」麓　也說：「大江以南，當推石濤為第一，予與石谷，皆所未逮。」</p>
<p>他的藝術究竟如何？張浦山「畫　續錄」則說：「「兼畫山水蘭竹，筆意縱恣，脫盡畫家窠臼，吳文肅公謂：師畫睥睨古今，矩矱橫溢。」</p>
<p>「揚州畫苑錄」云：巧於山水花卉，任意揮灑，雲氣迸出。</p>
<p>秦祖永「桐陰論畫」譽為「神品」，評云：「清湘老人道濟，筆意縱恣，脫盡畫家窠臼，與石溪師相伯仲，蓋石溪沉著痛快，以謹嚴勝，石濤排　縱橫，以奔放勝。」并云：山水自成一家，下筆古雅，設想超逸，每作一畫，與古人相合，功力之深，非於唐元諸家心領神會，烏克臻此？竹石蘭菊，均極超妙。」</p>
<p>石濤和尚究竟是怎樣的一個人物？從上述諸書之中，我們可以發現簡單的「前明楚潘之後。」與「勝國楚藩之後」的紀錄，也就是明室的後系。他的生卒年月，雖然一時未能考定，但從他的：「辛未冬日雪中，張汝作先生見招，才人傑士，擁座一時，公來日有都門之行，賦謝兼贈」的一詩首句「半生南北老風塵」看，那年是崇禎四年，（一六三一）他應該是三四十歲的人，即是生於明末清初的一位亂世人物，他不願看故國的變亂與受滿清異族的專制統治，但又是一個無力反抗的弱者，高蹈現實便是一條最好的出路，這是中國小資產階級的一貫作風，他的繪畫作風之異於四王吳惲，實在是他與滿清政府表現了強烈的不合作主義色彩以及表現了他的革命精神的原故。</p>
<p>削髮為黃山僧，似乎是高蹈現實的澈底辦法，他的不合作主義與革命精神，雖然在他的畫面的縱橫恣肆中表現出來，但畢覺是消極的。因之：宿命思想及其人生觀，即構成他的為僧與藝術風格表現同一的消極與隱避傾向，遺露在下列的許多詩句之中，如：</p>
<p>「……天仙下世真才傑，我公心方能超羣，君視富貴如浮雲，遊戲　　空典墳。愛客肯辭千日酒，風流氣壓五侯門，四海漁　齊拍導，歸來長　　王孫。人生飄忽等閒情，且隨酣暢眼縱橫……」……前引「辛未冬日雪中，張汝作……」。</p>
<p>「露地奇峯平到頂，聽天樓閣受泉風，白雲自是無情物，隨我枯心飄渺中。風急潮寬浪打頭。釣魚船小興難收，請君脫去烏紗帽，月上絲輪再整遊。」——「題畫」。</p>
<p>「林下蕭然紫　居，看雲聽水日無虛，此間自覺閑閑過，消受青山一卷書。」——「題畫」。</p>
<p>石濤眼見現實的紊亂興醜陋，他想起來改革，然而自己已是雲遊四海的和尚，於是只能借詩畫來拽憤，便有：「壬午春三月，大滌堂下北總海棠妖艷，戲寫并彷彿黃　遺意。」題着：</p>
<p>「萬蕊千花染以紅，停杯無語恨東風，薄寒且為花愁　，何况開時雀喙中。」</p>
<p>海棠的妖艷，怕就代表了那時的規實，他想改變，可是很怯懦，只有在色彩之中，略施微粉的勇氣而已。且看「次日重題」的詩：</p>
<p>「海棠校上問春歸，豈料春風雪滿枝，應為紅妝大妖艷，故施微粉着胭脂。」</p>
<p>壬午是祟禎十五年（一六四二），正是明朝即將亡國的時候，天下大亂，當然他會有如此的憤恨的。</p>
<p>石濤在矛盾的思維中過隱逸生活，也朱嘗不想找一條準確的出路，但這條出路，僅是錯綜地在他的畫論中發展，此地以「題春江圖」詩為證：</p>
<p>「書畫非小道，世人形似耳，州筆混沌開，入拙聰明死，理盡法無盡，法盡理生矣，理法本無傳，古人不得已。……」</p>
<p>這首詩裏頭「理」與「法」只是成為辯證的發展，但到「理」生的時候，又毫無勇氣的使它再向前發展，終於是停滯在宿命論的範疇裏頭了。</p>
<p>因之，「苦瓜和尚畫語錄」，大家都認為：「詞義玄妙，全從經典中得來。」是可表示懷疑的。因為像「一畫章」的「一畫之法，蓋以無法生有法；以有法貫眾法也。」也不過是上面所述的走着一致的傾向而已。</p>
<h3>石濤：山水</h3>
<p>（大風堂藏）</p>
<h3>池</h3>
<p>— 陳棘</p>
<p>在這僻瘠的鄉土裏，沒有奔放的大河；只有很多可愛的小池。</p>
<p>站在高山頂上，看這綠色的鄉土，光晶的池，像一把撤在夜空中的星星。也像我們記憶中，一個什麽人的眼睛……</p>
<p>池是沉默的，像一个哲人；池水是清澈的像一個哲人的心境。多少變幻在空中的風雲，看在他的眼裏；多少次湔雪的苦難，對凍住他的身子。但池還是默默的——</p>
<p>於是，有人說池的靈魂是僵呆的。情感是麻木的！</p>
<p>可是暖和的日子到來，池在周圍長出茁壯的蘆草，翡翠片似的浮萍；還有紫色的小花，白色的小花，金色的小花，嫩紅色的小花搖動在水面。愛熱鬧的蜻蜓，蝴蝶，一羣一羣地飛來了。夜晚，螢火虫提着小燈籠坐在產業尖上，三三兩兩，聽青蛙唱山歌。</p>
<p>這些，池哺育的生命，池創造的東園，花花草草好繁華！然而池默默的，還像一個哲人。</p>
<p>常常有些女子來池邊洗衣服，牧童來洗足上的污泥，人們都拿池水，不，池的血把自己洗得乾乾凈凈，而池水却給弄得如此的骯髒和混濁！池還是默默的，在默默裏，他把齷齪的東西沉澱下去，漸漸的池又清潔晶明。</p>
<p>旱災來了，陽光在田野裏燒着綠火，泥土開坼坼稻都無力地跌倒了，大家互相擠靠着，在熱風中微微呻吟。於是農人把水車的嘴伸進池裏；只見東面一把水車，西面一把水車，只聽水車咕咕地叫囂，池水是默默的。</p>
<p>第二天，池的血液流在田野的脈管裏，泥土滋潤，稻都挺直在晨光中。而池乾涸了，花花草東也枯癟了！</p>
<p>如今，這犧牲自己，拿血去救濟人家的池，就此默默地死去！</p>
<p>站在高山頂上，看這綠色的鄉土，那些小池，像我們記憶中，一個什麽人死後的，失光的眼睛……我們想到他的生平。</p>
<h3>音樂家的生涯</h3>
<p>— 嘉惠</p>
<p>莫扎德（Wolfgang　Amadeus　Moazart）極窮，他沒有錢買柴來烤暖他那間簡陋的住屋，他只能將雙手裹在羊毛短襪裏取暖，然後創造神聖的音樂，使他的名字，永垂不朽。</p>
<p>三十五歲時，他死於癆療，他的生活力是由於經常的飢寒與缺乏營養而耗减的。</p>
<p>他的可憐的葬儀實在只費去了三元一角。那價廉的松木棺材後而僅跟着六個人，—即使他們也因天雨而散去了。</p>
<h3>衛夫人的「筆陣圖」</h3>
<p>— 周曙山</p>
<p>晋時的衛夫人，既善隸書和正書，為右軍王逸少（羲之）之師，且作「筆陣圖」，垂諸後世，可見夫人能書，正與漢時的會大家等能文同。夫人名鑠，字茂漪，為汝陰太守李矩　，因亦稱為李夫人。又其父衛　和其兄衛恒，皆善草隸書，誠可謂家學淵源。</p>
<p>但夫人之所師為　　，法帖中有其「與師書」一通，內亦說到其弟子王右軍。其書云：「近奉勅寫急就章，遂不得與師書耳。但衛隨世所學，規模　　，遂歷多載，年廿著詩論草隸通解，不敢上呈。衛有一弟子王逸少，甚能學衛真書，咄咄逼人，筆勢洞精，字體　　，師可詣晋尚書館書耳，仰憑至鑑，大不可言。」至唐時的張懷瓘於「書斷」內說：「衛夫人隸書尤善規矩，鍾公云：碎玉壼之冰，　瑤台之月，婉然芳樹，穆若清風。」</p>
<p>夫人所作的「筆陳圖」，為解釋作字之法者，但在唐時的孫過庭於「書譜」內有云；「筆陣圖見南北流傳，疑是右軍所製，雖則未詳真偽，尚可發啟童蒙。」按王右軍以師事衛夫人，曾為作「題筆陣圖後」或即因此以啟孫過庭之疑。</p>
<p>又按夫人於「筆陳圖記」後，記明其是製於永和四年（西曆三四八年），去今已近一千六百年。而此記首云：「夫三端之妙，莫先乎用筆；六藝之奧，莫匪乎銀鈎。昔秦丞相斯見周穆王書，七日興歎，患其無骨；蔡尚書入鴻覩觀碼，十旬不返，嗟其出羣；故知達其源者少，關於其理者多。近代以來，殊不師古，而緣情棄道，纔記姓名，或學不該贍，聞見又寡，致使成功不就，虛費精神，自非通靈感物，不可與談斯道」。</p>
<p>而在此前尚有云：「筆要取崇山絕仞中兎毛，八九月收之，其筆頭長一寸，管長五寸，絳齊腰強者。其硯取煎涸新石，潤　相兼，浮津　墨者。其墨取廬山之松烟，代郡之鹿膠，十年以上強如石者為之。紙取東陽魚卵，虛柔滑淨者。凡學書字，先學執筆；若真書去筆頭二寸一分，若行草書去筆頭三寸一分執之，下筆點墨畫芟波屈曲，皆須盡一身之力而送之。若初學，先大書，不得從小。善鑒者不寫，善寫者不鑒。善筆力者多骨，不善筆力者多肉；多骨微肉者謂之筋書，多肉微骨者謂之墨豬。多力　筋者聖，無力無盤者病。一二從其消息而用之。」在圖後又云：「執筆有七種：有心急而執筆緩者，有心緩而執筆急者；若執筆近而不緊者，心手不齊，意後筆前者敗；若執筆遠而急，意前筆後者勝。又有六種用筆：結構圓備如篆法，飄颺灑落如章草，凶險可畏如八分，窈窕出入如飛白，耿介特立如鶴頭，鬰拔縱橫如古隸，然心委曲每為一字，各象其形，斯造妙矣，書道畢矣。」</p>
<p>至於其弟子王右軍於題後云：「紙者陣也，筆者刀梢也，墨者鍪甲也，水硯者城池也，心意者將軍也，本領者副將也，結構者謀略也，颺筆者吉凶也，出入者號令也，屈折者殺戮也。」此蓋為其所以名曰「筆陣」的說明。至有疑此非衛夫人所作者，則不外為一種傳統的偏見，可不再贅而已明。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風　28</p>
<p>我自己介紹了一遍，補充了小老虎那種貧乏的辭令，又給耀羣和W君介紹，當然還給小老虎來了一兩句不平凡的傳　。同時還不能不對耀羣把這一次拜會的「為什麼」說明，也是由於鶴見說過，這裏可以說話——因為地點是經他佈置過了的。</p>
<p>「為什麼來的這麼晚，大概您已經知道了，」我對耀羣說着，同時瞧了瞧小老虎，他楞着一雙大圓眼睛，很點靈的點了點頭，表示他把路上的遭遇都給耀羣說過。「為什麼必得請W君親自勞動一次，先上這兒來；一方面是古君的意思，一方面也是W君的意思，還有一方面，或者可以說更重要的一點，那是因為您的志氣，學識，思想，等等都是高人一等……」</p>
<p>「不敢當」，牠很乾脆的不讓我嚕囌下去了，「兩位先生都是老前輩，您話要是這樣說，那祇有叫我們孩子家慚愧。許多話，古君寫來的信上都說明白了。我和虎第弟現在祗進備着受教受訓，受栽培，聽命令」。聲音柔和裏面帶着一股剛勁。虎弟弟當然是指的小老虎。</p>
<p>「客氣客氣」。W君含笑開口了；接着，他停頓了一下，收起了笑容；「我們到這裏來，剛才岳先生說過了，有一半是鄙人的意思；不錯的，是鄙人對古君要求的。因為敝局的規則，不問是自行投效，或是經人介紹，凡是參加敝局工作的，必得經過三步手續；一，對參加者的調查；二，測騐——對工作的能力——，有特殊能力的，當然直接委聘，否則還得經過一些相當的訓練；三，正式委任。……</p>
<p>「關於一，二，兩點，有了古君的介紹和說明，我們可以用不着了。所以鄙人到這裏來，一方面確實是要表叫我們求才的誠意；此外，附加一點，也就是要履行敝局規定的形式。無論如何，在未曾正式參加之前，我們必得有一次談話——在本局任何處所以外的適宜地點。……」</p>
<p>假定您是一位寫作家，或是通訊社記者，或是某報社特派訪員，假定您經過某種介紹，對於W君或軍統局反間諜組織方面的重要人物，作一次訪問，我想，無論您天才多們高，本領多們大，您這一次的專誠訪問，準定失敗，至少勞而無功。</p>
<p>您也許可以由於挖空心思，旁敲側擊，而得到一些些「材料」，這就是您一點心血的代價，可是臨到您動身的那一剎那，您必然要聽到一句話；「剛才所談的這些話，因為我們還在「繼續工作」的關係。請您最好不必發表」！</p>
<p>好，您承認對於此行有些失望，（要是不肯馬上承認失敗的話。）在回館（報館）的途中，或回府的道上，您必定想，「至少我可以把他的寓所，他的舉止態度，他的什麼什麼，繞着圈子扯上些，再把自己的感想湊上幾句，還能說不是一篇訪問記？」</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>警惕</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>昨天，九月九日，在南京黃埔路中央軍校（前陸軍總司令部）舉行的中國戰區受降典禮，這一歷史塲面，我是參加了的，以一個新聞記者的身份，旁觀了這幕結束八年血戰的史劇演出。</p>
<p>整個會塲的佈置，是工兵專家馬崇六將軍所主持，莊嚴肅穆，而每個參加的人，以及會塲內外所洋溢的氣氛，我無法形容那種悲喜揉雜所表現的情緒。每個人心頭沉甸甸的，也有點茫茫然的，又有點喜孜孜的，可是八年歲月，千萬生命，大片河山，以及未來日子的建設，在腦子裏跳動着，大家都凝重起來！</p>
<p>這幕史劇的兩位主角，確是最鮮明的對照，最適當的一個說明：何應欽將軍，雍容氣度，溫文爾雅，和靄親切；岡村寗次，陰鶯沉着，像受傷的獸，表面屈服，一肚皮的倔强和不甘。老實說，典禮從上午九時開始，五十二分鐘，我祇是集中全部精力在注意這兩位主角的動作一切。</p>
<p>我祗有一個感想，這個感想一年後的今天清晰地記得，也將永遠記得，我願意在這里提供給大家作參考。</p>
<p>道個感想就是；日本這一民族是不可輕視的，他們現在雖然戰敗投降，他們絕未心服，他們有準備東山再起的決心，也有這個自信。我們現在雖然明光居於戰勝國，倘使我們不在最近十年內痛下功夫埋頭苦幹，將來永無和平可言，而且將深陷萬刦不復的境地。</p>
<p>慶祝勝利，我們該更深一層理解這一點！</p>
<h3>談考試作弊</h3>
<p>— 凌人</p>
<p>學生考試作弊之風氣，盛行於上海淪爲孤島以後，近來，更可算是登峯造極了。</p>
<p>而且，作弊的方法，竟是大規模地舉行，簡直是集體的行動。有組織，有機構，手段也極「高明」。先生們禁不勝禁，捉不勝捉，甚至有的根本無禁止的能力，只能眼開眼閉地，但望作弊的學生們，稍留餘地，「賜給」一些面子，或者不要過分猖獗就算了。</p>
<p>但是，他們有的是理由，半是半非的理由：</p>
<p>「有什麽辦法呢？假如不作弊，而成績不及格，要留級，要補習，那裏來的錢？」</p>
<p>「假如考試沒有達到所需的水準，那末，下學期的助學金如何核准？」這是上等的作弊「理田」。</p>
<p>「有什麽辦法呢？假如我不作弊，別人作弊，他們考得比我好」。</p>
<p>天啊！</p>
<p>請敎育專家們注意這些啊！切勿以爲分數好的學生，程度就高了。分數，這虛僞的東西，腐化了學生們！</p>
<h3>死得眞妙</h3>
<p>— 瑩影</p>
<p>本市某私立中學，平時敎導頗稱嚴格，畢業班學生有一科不及格者，則不給文憑，待補考及格後始行發給。一年前該校舊校長謝世，不久新校長誕生，且帶有新敎務主任，老敎務主任不得已而吿退，臨行時心中不甘，乃將所有該届畢業考試不及格學生之文憑全部發放，學生莫不以手加額，口稱老校長死得眞妙云。</p>
<h3>標售故事　現實的神話</h3>
<p>— 仲實</p>
<p>中國是個最神奇的古國而夏夜又是最適宜於神話的時節，因此這幾天來，在瓜棚豆架下，在茶餘酒後，朋友們閒閒叙說着很多使人難信的故事——或者更正確的說，比故事還奇的眞事</p>
<p>有一個毛姓小商人，某次從楊樹浦的一個碼頭倉庫中買到公家標售的五木箱玻璃管等雜物，價格是一百八十萬元，隔了些日子，轉賣給一個機器廠老闆，竟得了八百萬。却不道道老編倒是個識貨的，拆箱檢親了一下，知道道是貴重的化學廠儀器；恰好最近有個外國廠急切需要，一口氣竟答應他三萬萬元的代價。老闆呢？他才不那麼傻呢！討價五萬萬元。</p>
<p>又有一次，一個舊貨商以一百十一萬元員得十八箱拍賣的水潰貨。開箱一看，却是猪鬃，價値八千餘萬元。又有一個姓許的鐵商，是朋友的朋友。他却也蒙財神光顧了一次，那一天，他隨了幾個同業到標賣的所在閒逛，也拿八十餘萬買了幾桶油。同業們開出來是水，他却幸運地開桶得到了桐油，就這樣莫明其妙地不勞而獲地賺了二千多萬。</p>
<p>中國本來多的是「江西人識寳」等等的民間傳說，却不道眞實的「識寳得財」會發生在今日。標售機關白損失了一筆財產，少數的幾個商人却肥了。不知道這是他們的福，還是國家的不幸？</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 三公</p>
<p>「接收淸査團，何日君再來？」</p>
<p>九九體育節的宣傳標語中，有一條是「敎育第一體育爲先」。由此聯想到現今一些　　小學中的「晒台　動塲」，所負的使命該是多麽偉大！，</p>
<p>敵僞時期的律師，現在已准恢復出庭。這該是漢奸嫌疑犯聘請辯護律師的一個對象，因爲唯有這些律師，才是最能「瞭解」的「人」。</p>
<p>以體育的眼光來看賽馬，有人認爲「正常娛樂」，而且每月還有三萬萬至五萬萬的收入，加以市政會議業已通過，因此有人猜測，恢復賽馬什九已不成問題。熱中於香檳票的人們盍興乎來。</p>
<p>中國人有一張「善於演講的嘴」，美國人有一雙「善於實行的手」。因此中國的出口貨　了幾個月，僅僅還在籌備展覽，而美國的進口貨却在無聲無息中，把具有五千年歷史的大餅油條豆漿亦已打倒了。</p>
<p>淸査團已經去杭州了，臨行前對記者說：「在上海所辦的案件，尙不足十分之一。」那末其餘十分之九呢？不禁使人懷念着「何日君再來」？</p>
<h3>要求榮德生先生</h3>
<p>— 任梓光</p>
<p>以贖欸七分之一恢復故鄉四學校</p>
<p>現在榮案已成過去，贖款二十五萬美金，也由政府發還。據報載，榮先生預備將此款提出一部分獎勵破案軍警外，餘款悉充善舉，不過如何分配辦法，尙有待榮先生核定，是用作救濟難民之用呢，還是用作興辦敎育之用呢？我以爲救濟難民固然要緊，但興辦敎育更加要緊，所以我們絕對同情少夫先生的說法，舉辦「德生費學金。」</p>
<p>但我對於德老還有一個意見因爲榮先生對於敎育事業，素來萬分熱心，所以三十年前已在故鄕（無錫榮巷）附近一帶，創辦四個小學和一個中學，歷年來造就的人才不知凡幾，年來故鄕一帶在工商界人才輩出，不能謂無因。抗戰軍興，地方匪類橫行，所以這幾所學校和榮氏脫離了關係，在半開半關的腐敗情形下勉强維持，現在抗戰雖然勝利，不過熒先生恐怕忙於恢復事業，所以除一所中學外，四所小學仍未予以接收，所以我想趁此機會請榮先生提出贖款的七分之一，計一億元，來恢復道四所學校，設以一億元之數來購置校產，照無錫田價，的可購田八十畝，每校二十畝，已足够永久維持了。</p>
<p>筆者不揣冒昧，謹爲桑梓請命請榮先生毅然興學，來恢復戰前的桑梓四校，再將大部分款子，創立「德生貸學金」，果爾，對社會對民族，一定有無限價値的。</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting Outside Koupei Pass; National Army in Eastern Sui Marches South Apace; Already Pressing Near Pingtichuan, Fengchen, and Jining</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, September 9th) Recent newspaper war reports have been largely inaccurate. Five days ago, it was reported that Koupei Pass had been recovered, but fierce fighting is still ongoing in the outer areas. The 93rd Army has advanced to Liangjianfang, ten kilometers from Koupei Pass, while the New 6th Army is advancing south from Luanping to attack Koupei Pass directly, currently crossing the He River and moving south. The National Army moving north from Chengteh, after garrisoning Lungwha, immediately began clearing the countryside and consolidating the outer areas, and has not yet advanced towards the encircled area. Reports from Peiping officials on the 6th regarding the recapture of Chifeng are inconsistent. A large army has now gathered in Jehol, with the 93rd, 53rd, New 6th, and part of the 13th Armies seemingly forming the main force, possessing considerable strength. Transportation in Jehol remains paralyzed, with 85 kilometers of the roadbed between Chengteh East and Pingchuan completely destroyed, making military access impossible within the month. Only 15 kilometers of damage exist between Pingchuan and Lingyuan, which can be repaired and reopened to traffic within days. The tunnel structures between Peiping and Chengteh have also been destroyed. Even if the Peiping-Chengteh land route is cleared and transportation restored, it will still take considerable time.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, September 9th) According to reports from relevant agencies here, Fu Tso-yi's troops, moving east along the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway to aid Tatung, engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist forces yesterday outside Pingtichuan. Another report claims that another part of General Fu's troops has reached the vicinity of Fengchen, but this has not been confirmed. The situation in Tatung has indeed eased due to General Fu's actions, and the defending troops have telegraphed requesting continued replenishment of ammunition.</p>
<p>(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Taiyuan, September 9th) On the night of the 8th, over two thousand Communist troops attacking Tatung continued their assault on the city walls, engaging in fierce fighting until the morning of the 9th, but were repelled each time. Furthermore, the National Army recovered Yicheng at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 4th.</p>

<h3>Admiral Cooke's Remarks in Peiping; US Troops Will Not Withdraw Temporarily; Anping Incident Can Reach a Reasonable Resolution</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, September 9th) Admiral Cooke, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, hosted reporters at the Peking Hotel on the morning of the 9th, accompanied by Major General Lockard. Cooke first stated that he did not say that the United States would change its attitude towards the Chinese civil war based on changes in the Chinese civil war. He said: In Tsingtao, someone asked whether the US troops stationed in China would participate in the Chinese civil war. He replied that they had transported many things to supply the Military Mediation Department and the US troops, but he did not believe that anyone accused these materials of having any purpose other than peace. The Anping incident has an investigation team. The US side reported that they were attacked while transporting supplies, but the other side claimed that the US side fired first, and pointed out that these materials were transported to help China fight a civil war. However, we firmly believe that this incident will have a reasonable resolution and will not affect the work of the Military Mediation Department. In answering reporters' questions, he said: The mission of the US troops in China is mostly completed. In the future, they will help China train its army and handle the transfer of materials. The US troops in Shanghai will be transferred to Tsingtao. One reporter asked about the duration and purpose of the US military presence in China. Cooke said: In order to protect the interests of American merchants in China, it is temporarily necessary to stay. When the situation in China improves, they will be withdrawn immediately. Finally, one reporter asked how much the US maintaining the transportation route from Chinwangtao to Tsingtao had to do with supplying the Military Mediation Department. Cooke said: In addition to supplying the Military Mediation Department with materials, there are of course other purposes. Cooke will fly to Tsingtao on the 10th, and his flagship is waiting in Tsingtao.</p>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, Peiping, September 9th) Admiral Cooke said: Regarding the Anping incident, if the Military Mediation Department's ruling is in favor of the Communist side, then the supply of materials to the Military Mediation Department may be cut off in the future.</p>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, Peiping, September 9th) Major General Lockard, Commander of the US Marine Corps in China, announced today that his successor, Major General Howard, will arrive in Tsingtao tomorrow, and he himself will return to the United States within ten days.</p>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, Peiping, September 9th) Brigadier General Beall Smith, Chief of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department, has been ill for more than two months recently, but has now fully recovered and will travel with his wife on a Navy transport ship on the 25th of this month.</p>

<h3>Cheng Chien Returns to Hankow and Writes Poems with Emotion</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Hankow Office, September 9th) Since returning to Hankow from Kuling, Director Cheng Chien has been feeling emotional about current affairs for days, writing three poems. One of them, written on the boat, is quite well-structured. The original text reads: "The boat flows smoothly eastward, the fires burn fiercely in the south, the owls and flutes fly north, the beasts retreat west in pretense, the fields of Lai have new grass, the burdens of levies have not ceased for the people, I sadly remember the numerous hoofprints, and am saddened to see wounds everywhere. I take on the difficult heart of relief, and hope to ease the original desire. I rely on the wisdom of the people to hold back the dangers, I hear of good advice and thinkers, I, personally, hope to hold back difficulties and hoarding, observe customs in Lang County, not fearing the heat of summer, nor the autumn sun, the cool breeze relieves the heat, and timely rain eases the drought, I lift my head to look at Mount Lu, and my worries are scattered with the wind."</p>
<h3>Political Negotiations at a Standstill; Five Representatives in Nanking Had No Activities Yesterday; Special Envoy Marshall Spends the Mid-Autumn Festival in Kuling</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) Political negotiations are at a standstill. The five representatives of the informal five-person group had no activities in Nanking. Ambassador Stuart went to the embassy on the 9th to work, reportedly the first time he has been to the embassy to handle official business since taking office. Chou En-lai went to Lingku Temple for an outing on the 8th and did not go out all day on the 9th, waiting for instructions from Yenan. Government representatives Wu Tieh-cheng and Chang Li-sheng also worked as usual. Special Envoy Marshall was originally scheduled to return to Nanking on the 9th, but it is reported that he postponed his return for two days because the Chairman invited him to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival in Kuling. It is also learned that Special Envoy Marshall's delayed return to Nanking was not only due to the Chairman's invitation, but also possibly because the negotiations in Kuling had made no progress, so there was no need to rush back to Nanking.</p>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, Nanking, September 9th) Communist spokesman Wang Ping-nan issued a warning last night, stating: If the five-person committee unfortunately "dies prematurely," it means that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have broken up and the American mediation has finally failed. He said: The committee can only convene if the government issues a ceasefire order. He also said: If the committee does not convene, it will inevitably lead to the final split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. As of now, the government has not expressed any intention to guarantee the issuance of a ceasefire order.</p>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, Nanking, September 9th) According to political observers here: The government's successive military victories in the past two months have made the Communist position even more unfavorable. As a last resort, it seems to have adopted a last resort, and if the government does not agree to an unconditional ceasefire, it will threaten to form another government and convene another National Assembly. The most significant development in the current political situation is the change in the military situation.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Unlikely to be Held in the Short Term</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) The regular meeting of the Central Standing Committee this week will reportedly discuss the restoration of the Central Party Headquarters and its affiliated agencies, and Commissioners Chen Kuo-fu, Hsiao Tung-tzu, and Pai Yun-ti will report on the progress of the handling.</p>
<h3>Chairman Plans to Inspect Nanchang; All Sectors in Kiangsi Province Are Preparing to Welcome Him; Chairman and Mrs. Chiang Invite Marshall et al. to Tour Hanhopow</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Kuling Office, September 9th) The citizens of Nanchang are overjoyed to learn that Chairman Chiang plans to come to the province for an inspection after the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all sectors in the provincial capital have organized a preparatory meeting to welcome Chairman Chiang. Wang Ling-chi, Chen Chao-ying, Chan Jung-chien, Wang Chen-hsin, Wang Yu-lan, and others serve on the presidium of the meeting.

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Departs for Home; Discusses the Issue of Japanese Reparations in Paris; We Will Not Make Excessive Demands</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Paris, September 9th) Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh is scheduled to return to Nanking via London on September 10th. During his absence, the position of our country's chief representative will be assumed by Mr. Kuo Tai-chi.</p>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, New York, September 9th) The New York Times today published an interview with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh in Paris, stating: China does not intend to make reparations demands on Japan that Japan cannot afford, or to adopt retaliatory policies against Japan. Foreign Minister Wang will leave France for Nanking on Tuesday. He predicted that five peace treaties will be concluded in Paris, but insisted that this does not necessarily guarantee that the five powers can reach an agreement on the issues of Japan and Germany. He said: The Japanese issue "should be simpler than the German issue, because Japan itself has no disarmament to speak of, and at the same time, the United States and China, which should receive the largest amount of compensation, will not make excessive demands. The war losses suffered by major Chinese cities have been severe, but so far there is still no number for compensation. At the same time, we are currently studying how to dismantle Japan's industrial equipment to prevent Japan from rearming. The only important issue facing the Far Eastern powers is the issue of control after the conclusion of the peace treaty. The United States' proposal to lift Japan's military equipment for 25 years should be accepted by China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. Since the Soviet Union has not occupied Japan, it should be simpler for it to accept this Far Eastern treaty than to accept the German treaty. In addition, the Korean issue is of course a difficult issue."</p>
<h3>American Government Association for China; Exposes the Communist Conspiracy; Points Out That the Current Negotiations Are Deceptive; Sends Letter to the President Requesting Support for the National Government</h3>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, Washington, August 8th) Several Americans who formerly resided in China today sent a letter to President Truman, calling the Communist Party "treacherous rebels" and urging full and unconditional support for the legal government led by Chairman Chiang. The American Policy Association for China, including Representative Judd, a member of the association's board of directors, and the wife of the publisher of "Time" and "Life" magazines, Luce, also requested the Soviet Union to return Chinese territory that it should not control to the Chinese government in accordance with the Yalta Agreement and the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The letter was accompanied by a translation of Notice No. 16 of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, which pointed out that the negotiations between the Chinese Communist Party and General Marshall "are deceptive in nature and have no intention of reaching an agreement. The purpose is only to buy time" to consolidate the strength of the Chinese Communist Party in order to occupy the whole of China. The association believes that this document is sufficient to show that the Soviet Union still controls the Chinese Communist Party, and that the Far Eastern Bureau of the Third International, which was nominally dissolved in 1943, still exists in fact, and that the actions and policies of the Chinese Communist Party are still subject to the control of the Third International. The letter also requested the reorganization of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, and that key positions in the Division should be filled by individuals who fully agree with the above-mentioned American policy.</p>
<p>(United Press Dispatch, New York, August 8th) The American Policy Association for China today released what it called evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is controlled by Moscow and has no intention of reaching an agreement with Chairman Chiang. It is claimed that the CCP intends to use peace talks to delay, so as to take the opportunity to consolidate its territory, obtain military equipment from the Soviet Union, train troops in the Northeast, some of whom are Japanese, Koreans, and puppet troops, infiltrate the territory controlled by the Kuomintang, and try to alienate the United States' sympathy and assistance for Chairman Chiang. This conclusion is said to be based on Document No. 16 of the Central Political Bureau of the CCP, which was decided on March 12 and has now been translated into English. Signed by the Association's Secretary-General, Loomis, a copy was sent to President Truman. The president of the association is Powell, publisher of the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai. According to the talk, the association currently has more than 100 members. Loomis did not explain how the association learned of Document No. 16 of the Central Political Bureau of the CCP. He only said that the person who provided this evidence was extremely reliable. Judging from the wording of the document, it can be known that it is controlled by Moscow. The document has pointed out that the plan it proposed has been agreed by the Far Eastern Bureau of the Communist Party. It is claimed that the Bureau is an organization under the Communist International, which was dissolved in 1943. The document mentioned the strategy of negotiating on one hand and continuing to fight on the other, and said; The Northeast is the best area to launch a local offensive, because it is "close to our great ally, the Soviet Union, and we will not have problems obtaining supplies in that area." In addition, the CCP representatives negotiating peace were advised to use revolutionary tactics to alienate the relationship between the United States and Chairman Chiang. It also stated: "At the same time, we should adopt a delaying policy, and not resolve any issues when negotiating with the Kuomintang, in order to shake people's confidence and make the Kuomintang's political position unstable." The Policy Association for China urged President Truman to demand that political control over the Chinese people be abandoned.</p>
<h3>Mechanized Units</h3>

<h3>Adjustment of Tariff Rates Must Go Through Legal Procedures</h3>
<p>Implementation Period Will Be Several Months Later</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) Consultant Chou of the Ministry of Finance said that the adjustment of tariffs is under the jurisdiction of the Customs Administration. The tax rate will be formulated by the Customs Administration according to the actual situation of all parties, and then the Department of Finance will sign and comment on it, and then the Minister will make a decision. Before implementation, it must be passed by the Executive Yuan meeting before it can be promulgated, so it will take at least a few months, and it cannot be decided hastily in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Talk by British Ambassador in Shanghai: Seeking to Enhance Sino-British Friendship, Trade and Industry Delegation to Visit China This Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th dispatch by United Press] Mr. Thornton, an official of the Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers' Union, stated today that he will accompany the British trade delegation to China within the week. The delegation consists of six businessmen representing the engineering, textile, and food industries, led by Mr. Bowes, Chairman of Grosvenor, Chater &amp; Co.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Sir Steven, the new British Ambassador to China, hosted a reception for reporters at the Cathay Hotel yesterday afternoon. The Ambassador, accompanied by Mr. MacDonald, the head of the Information Section of the British Embassy, appeared energetic and cheerful. After a brief introduction by Mr. MacDonald, the Ambassador delivered a speech, saying: "I am extremely pleased to be in Shanghai. Shanghai is not only the trade center of China but also the premier commercial port of the Far East. From what I have seen, I deeply feel that the past achievements are already numerous, and the future development is undoubtedly limitless. The United Kingdom has also assisted in the construction of this metropolis, and as a British national, I am proud of this. The United Kingdom is very willing to continue to do its best as a friend of China, and this effort will only serve to increase the mutual benefits of the two countries and will not contain any other purpose. My visit here is to enhance the friendship and mutual understanding between China and the United Kingdom, which I regard as my responsibility." When mentioning his impressions of Shanghai, the Ambassador said in a humorous tone: "Shanghai is full of vitality, life, spirit—and also full of noise." He continued: "This abundant vitality and spirit will undoubtedly be beneficial to the revival of China." The Ambassador then announced that the United Kingdom will send a delegation to China in the latter half of this month. The delegation will include many representatives from the British light and heavy industries and will be led by Mr. Boyce. They are expected to stay in China for about three months to investigate industry and commerce and strive to find better ways to develop Sino-British trade.</p>
<p>(The photo shows the Ambassador's expression when hosting the reception for reporters, taken by this newspaper.)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Sino-British Commercial Treaty Have Not Officially Begun; Believes China Must Curb Internal Conflicts Itself</h3>
<p>At this point, the reporters asked questions one after another, and the Ambassador answered them one by one. The main points are as follows: (1) Question: What is the situation of the Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations? Answer: The negotiations have not officially begun, but several months ago, the British side submitted a full draft of the commercial treaty to the Chinese government. (2) Question: Do foreigners currently residing in China also need visas when traveling within the country? I wonder if the UK will take similar measures when signing the treaty, so that Chinese living in the UK also need visas when traveling in the UK? Answer: Foreigners in the United Kingdom do not need a visa to travel from London to Liverpool. If China wants to open up, it should provide some convenience to foreign guests visiting China. (3) Question: What is the situation of remittances from the UK to the Far East? Answer: Remittances are already available in Hong Kong, and it is planned to extend them to Shanghai soon. (4) Question: What is the progress of the previous rumor that the UK intends to lend China 50 million pounds? Answer: No progress has been made, because the UK is not very wealthy at the moment. (5) Question: Does the UK intend to participate in mediating the Chinese war? Answer: No, I am very impressed by the perseverance and efforts of General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. Marshall is the most ideal foreign person to mediate this matter. However, internal conflicts can only be curbed by the Chinese people themselves. Marshall and Stuart can only assist. (6) Question: Has the Chinese government mentioned any negotiations regarding Hong Kong? Answer: Never. (7) Question: Please tell us about the Ambassador's past experience. Answer: First in Bulgaria, then to Spain. I witnessed the tragedy of the civil war and was busy evacuating British citizens. In 1940, I traveled around the Mediterranean with Mr. Eden and Chief of the General Staff General Dill. At that time, the crisis of German invasion was imminent. This trip involved Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and other countries. Greece's determination to resist Germany was strengthened by this trip. Mr. Eden's negotiations with Yugoslavia were successful. I have also met with Marshal Tito. The Ambassador then said with a smile: "That's all there is to my life's work!" (8) Question: Are there any major problems between the two countries before the signing of the Sino-British commercial treaty? Answer: Even if there are problems, they are all domestic rather than international. The current situation of various British enterprises in China is not satisfactory. I am eager to improve this situation, but it is difficult to say whether I will succeed. Arriving in Beijing by ship on the 20th of this month [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Lieutenant General Power, the new commander of the British Pacific Fleet, Captain Pursley, commander of the British 19th Destroyer Squadron, the light cruiser HMS Belfast, and the destroyer HMS Trafalgar are scheduled to visit the capital on September 20 to formally pay respects to the government and pay their respects to President Chiang.</p>

Ships are carrying the bodies of Americans shot down by Yugoslavia across the ocean back home, while other ships are carrying goods to Yugoslavia, as if nothing had happened." According to reports he received, Marshal Marvel managed to have the steel rails declared surplus property of the Army Corps of Engineers in March, after which UNRRA acquired them. When UNRRA took over the task of acquiring the steel rails, it obtained special priority from the War Assets Administration, with the understanding that the steel rails would be shipped to China and not elsewhere. At the same time, it began to freeze all available materials. However, by August 7, the plan had changed. Of the 10,789 tons of steel rails and accessories acquired by UNRRA, 8,215 tons were designated for shipment to Yugoslavia, with a value of US$337,348. At that time, there were still 2,538 tons of steel rails in the warehouse designated for shipment to China, with a value of US$112,661. Before long, an order was apparently issued to divert these 2,583 tons of steel rails to Yugoslavia as well. Subsequently, he heard that UNRRA had tried to find steel rails in the US surplus materials in Europe to supply to China, but had not achieved significant success. UNRRA Director La Guardia ordered a halt to the shipment of all materials to China except for essential food in July. However, Mr. Brewster said that he did not believe that the steel rails were diverted to Yugoslavia because of this suspension order, because he received reports that the person who ordered the diversion of the steel rails was the UNRRA Industrial Rehabilitation Division's representative in Yugoslavia. American sailors are currently on strike, so some of the steel rails may not have been shipped yet. If so, he hopes that the State Department or UNRRA will take action to prevent their shipment."</p>

<h3>Government Negotiating with US on Medium Landing Craft</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 9th] According to a report by the US Navy Department, US Navy landing craft have solved the long-standing problem of Yangtze River navigation. The problem of Yangtze River navigation lies in the extremely rapid currents of the upper reaches of the river. The US medium landing craft No. 470, when fully loaded with materials, only draws eight feet of water. It has recently navigated the Hankou-Chongqing section twice with great success. As such, the Chinese government has negotiated with the US to purchase several surplus US medium landing craft to facilitate navigation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Jianghan Customs Commissioner Elaborates on Embezzlement; Claims Allegations by Investigation Team Are Based on Conjecture from Records</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Hankou, 9th] Mr. Chen Yingkun, the Commissioner of Jianghan Customs, recently issued a statement elaborating on the allegations of embezzlement made by the investigation team. He stated briefly that each time the customs office auctioned materials, it was reported to the Special Commissioner of the Executive Yuan. The allegations made by the investigation team were entirely based on conjecture from the numbers in the records and were not thoroughly investigated. The reason for selling by installments and gradually reducing prices was to comply with the regulations of the Executive Yuan to avoid manipulation and hoarding by those with strong capital.</p>
<h3>Layoffs in Telecommunications; Three Standards Proposed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 9th] A responsible person from the Ministry of Communications said on the 9th that the standards for layoffs in telecommunications are: (1) Redundant personnel in administrative departments will be appropriately laid off; (2) Senior technical personnel who are encountering challenges to their physical strength will be paid retirement and pension funds; (3) Senior personnel with technical skills who are physically strong, will receive further training after their selection. Those who have served in the puppet regime will be laid off first. This standard is partly a personnel adjustment and cannot be called a layoff. In addition, in terms of performance in completion, it will be used to restore national communications. Existing communication personnel are still insufficient. It is unnecessary to cut personnel. Telecommunications colleagues should respect the government's orders. However, to prevent malpractices during future implementation, the National Telephone Workers' Union Preparatory Committee has launched local groups to assist and supervise the implementation of layoffs in the telecommunications industry and follow-up work in various places.</p>

<h3>Philippine Authorities Announce Reasons for Searching Overseas Chinese Newspaper Office; Military Police Headquarters Apologizes to New Min Times</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th] The Philippine Presidential Palace announced today: The reason why the Philippine government searched an overseas Chinese newspaper office was because several people complained that some of the people who frequently visited the newspaper were related to illegal elements and a certain kidnapping gang. The kidnapping gang has traditionally targeted prominent figures among the overseas Chinese, so the arrest has nothing to do with the newspaper's editorial policy or newspaper policy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th] The Chinese-language China Guide and China Commercial News, run by overseas Chinese here, were searched by the military police, and the Communist Party's mouthpiece, the China Guide, failed to publish today. Reporters have learned that the New Min Times was also searched, but the Philippine Military Police Headquarters apologized to the newspaper this morning. The Military Police Headquarters issued a statement this afternoon stating: "The Military Police Headquarters has quickly interrogated and reviewed the certificates and activities of the arrested foreign residents. They have all been released within the six-hour time limit, and there will be no more arrests today."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Passes Important Resolutions; Sends Telegrams to US President and Mao Zedong; Elects Xu Shaodi to Fill Vacancy on People's Political Council</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, 9th] Luo Xia, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Political Council, previously resigned due to participating in the election of the chairman of the Provincial Assembly, and her resignation was approved. The Executive Yuan limited the by-election to be held before September 10. The Provincial Assembly has now elected Mr. Xu Shaodi to fill the vacancy as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Political Council.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly continued its general meeting today, listened to the report from the Health Department, and passed two telegrams to Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and US President Truman. The former appealed to the Communist Party to rein in at the brink of the precipice, sincerely implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, immediately stop the all-out offensive, and resolve all issues through peaceful methods. The latter stated that they were grateful to the United States for its spiritual and material assistance in achieving victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but opposed domestic division and separatism, and sincerely hoped that the United States would implement its past policies and continue to assist the National Government in building a democratic, unified, peaceful, and strong nation.</p>
<p>The General Assembly also discussed the issue of reducing land tax collection and adjusting tariffs, and resolved to elect two representatives to go to Beijing to make a plea, and to cooperate with representatives of fellow villagers in Shanghai to strive for a 40% reduction in land tax collection, the same as in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<h3>Yang Yanbin Confesses in Wuxi; Says He Has Always Kept to Himself and Never Became a Bandit in the Lake; Willing to Engage in Pacification Work Under the Leadership of the Government</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Wuxi] Yang Yanbin, the bandit leader in Taihu Lake who surrendered, arrived in Wuxi at 9:00 AM on the 7th with General Mao Sen, Director of the Second Division of the Capital Garrison Command. On the same day, he went to the city defense command, visited the commander, and Commander Chen. He also met with County Magistrate Xu at the county government, and the meeting was very pleasant. He expressed that he was willing to engage in pacification work under the leadership of the government to protect local security. According to him: "I have absolutely no knowledge of the Taihu Lake bandits attacking villagers in Southern Quanzhou and Wutangmen. Moreover, I have never been to Taihu Lake. The rumors that I and Wu Zilong are both bandits in Taihu Lake are completely untrue. In early December last year, after I attended the Third Front Army Security Conference in Wuxi, my troops were incorporated into the 71st Army on the 26th of that month. I was transferred to be a major general senior staff officer of the Third Front Army. Later, in order to fulfill my filial piety as a son, I went to Chongqing on January 1 this year to run around because my father Shou was detained in a case. I returned to Shanghai in early April, hiding in the suburbs and keeping to myself. In April of this year, a former district chief of Wujiang County told me: "The current situation is unstable. We have already organized ourselves in Taihu Lake. Please, boss, go to the countryside and enter the lake immediately." I strongly refused. Later, I lived in seclusion in the countryside of Xujiahui. Unexpectedly, my residence was discovered again, and I was persuaded to enter the lake, saying: "If you don't go, that's fine, but you must use the name Yang Yanbin as a banner." But I still firmly refused to go. After that, whenever those people took any action, they claimed to be subordinates of Yang Yanbin, which led to rumors outside, even saying that I had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Democratic Allied Army, which is not true. Now, I have been recruited by Ren Yuandao and can dedicate myself to the country. I reported to Commander Tang and expressed my heartfelt feelings, and General Yang has approved it. As for the bandits in Taihu Lake, there are two factions, old and new, with more than 8,000 people and well-equipped weapons. I have sent personnel into the lake to recruit the old troops, hoping to influence them with emotion and make them abandon evil and return to righteousness to serve the country."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reform and Innovation in Shanghai Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>The first Shanghai Municipal Council opened at Yiyuan yesterday. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the councilors will surely have enthusiastic discussions on various aspects of the municipal facilities that should be promoted and reformed. At the same time, the measures for regulating traffic in the central district announced by the municipal authorities were also declared effective yesterday; it is expected that the traffic congestion in the central urban area will be greatly improved thereafter. At this juncture, it would not be unhelpful for us to conduct a review of Shanghai's municipal administration.</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that although Shanghai's municipal administration in the past year since the victory has not been able to fully meet the ideals of the citizens of Shanghai, the municipal authorities have indeed been working hard in the past year. Many of the current problems in Shanghai are, in essence, not entirely problems of Shanghai alone, but are inextricably linked to the overall national situation. Economic problems, caused by the fluctuations in the value of the legal tender, are not something that the municipal authorities can completely and satisfactorily solve unilaterally. The same is true of problems such as transportation. The solution to these problems lies in the whole rather than the part. As long as there is a comprehensive solution, the problems of a single city or a single point will not be difficult to solve. Therefore, we cannot expect the municipal authorities to completely solve the many problems that have arisen in Shanghai. Only within the scope of purely municipal affairs is this the responsibility of the municipal authorities. Since Mayor Wu took office, his efforts and achievements in this regard in the short period of a few months should be worthy of our praise. However, Shanghai has been occupied for eight years, and the situation has changed significantly since this restoration. The concessions, as symbols of semi-colonialism, have now been eliminated due to our eight years of hard struggle. Today's Shanghai has a completely unified municipal administration. From now on, the rise and fall of Shanghai's municipal administration will not only affect the welfare of the citizens, but also the international perception, which is sufficient to affect our country's international status. Therefore, our concern for Shanghai's municipal administration is naturally particularly keen.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Shanghai's recovery, due to the special circumstances, the municipal institutions and organizations were often adapted to the times and circumstances, and could not fully comply with the central government's regulations. Since Mayor Wu took office, he has been committed to rectifying this aspect; the abolition of the deputy mayor and the merger of the General Affairs Office are all aimed at ensuring that Shanghai's municipal institutions can comply with the central government's regulations. However, as of now, Shanghai's municipal institutions still do not seem to fully comply with the central government's legal standards. Those that cannot be retained due to special circumstances should be passed by the Municipal Council, requesting the central government to change the legal provisions to make them more flexible, so that each city can have room for flexibility due to different local circumstances. Otherwise, the municipal government should quickly change its current internal organization, so that the central government's laws do not become mere formalities. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, we should build the country with the rule of law, and we must not stand outside the law again.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current Shanghai municipal administration, the most shameful thing for Shanghai is the congestion and disorder of traffic. Now that the measures for regulating traffic in the central district are being implemented, according to our observations, this method of regulating traffic in the city still does not touch the heart of the problem. What is the heart of the problem? This is because Shanghai has a large area and a large population, but the number of public vehicles is too small, so all kinds of vehicles are squeezed together on narrow roads. The vehicles of the former British-owned China General Omnibus Company have now disappeared in Shanghai; the routes of trolley buses have been reduced a lot; and the number of trams has also been reduced a lot. In order to solve the problem of "travel," citizens have pedicabs, rickshaws, carriages, "tiger cars," and jeeps. As long as the number of public vehicles is increased as much as possible, the number of other vehicles will decrease. The Founding Father added the word "travel" in addition to food, clothing, and shelter, but "travel" is the most problematic thing in today's Shanghai. Shanghai originally had a fairly convenient public transportation system, but at that time, the municipal administration was not unified. Now that the municipal administration has been unified, it should focus on the entire Shanghai, planning and establishing a sound public transportation system. Regarding traffic, we hope that the municipal authorities can do more positive work and less passive banning.</p>
<p>As for other matters that should be promoted and reformed in municipal administration, there are many, and we do not need to list them one by one. The municipal councilors come from the people and are deeply aware of the hardships of the people's livelihood. They must have long had plans for the various aspects of municipal administration that should be promoted and reformed. At this meeting, it is said that there are more than 300 proposals, which shows that there are quite a few measures that should be taken in the municipal administration. What we want to emphasize is that Shanghai is an international city, and any measures must not only not violate the spirit of our founding, but also take into account internationality, so that Shanghai's position can continue to develop and can set an example of local autonomy for our Three Principles of the People to build the country.</p>
<h3>Will the Five-Person Committee Be Stillborn?</h3>
<p>Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan warned yesterday that if the five-person group were indeed stillborn, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would eventually break up, and the United States' mediation in China would ultimately fail. This is a report from the United Press Nanjing telegram.</p>
<p>Due to Wang Bingnan's warning, we, who had originally placed some expectations on this five-person group, could not help but feel the fear that the five-person meeting would be stillborn.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the focus of the KMT-CPC dispute originally lay in military issues, namely, the reorganization and unification of the army, the withdrawal of the Communist army from certain areas, and the implementation of a ceasefire between the two sides. The government's intention was to implement these matters first, and then discuss political issues and implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, the Communist Party firmly opposed this. Therefore, Ambassador Stuart suggested to Marshal Ma, and with the consent of the Communist Party representatives, to change the steps and first discuss the reorganization of the National Government, believing that as long as the National Government could be reorganized to accommodate the participation of the Communist Party and other parties, then all subsequent disputes could be discussed and decided in this supreme National Government Committee. The mediator's ability can be said to have been exhausted, and China's peaceful unification would have bright hopes. Ambassador Stuart previously went to Lushan six times to make sincere suggestions to President Chiang for this matter; he finally obtained President Chiang's consent, and then happily went down the mountain to make arrangements and negotiations. Ambassador Stuart was naturally particularly happy and increased his optimism. Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng also went to Gu to ask for instructions, and returned to Nanjing to prepare for discussions. "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, there is another village with bright willows and blooming flowers;" our ordinary people have even greater expectations.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhou Enlai first had to say to people that this was just an "attempt," and later insisted on first discussing the preconditions, which are the platitudes of unconditional ceasefire that are contrary to actual actions. As soon as we heard this kind of platitude, we felt that the future was not good. Now Wang Bingnan has indeed shouted again, warning that if it is stillborn, there will be a breakup, and mediation will fail. To be honest, the Communist Party probably had no sincerity in negotiating success from the beginning!</p>
<p>The Communist Party originally thought that the government would not be willing to discuss the issue of the reorganization of the National Government first, so it suggested to Ambassador Stuart to discuss this issue first to stump the government and make the government bear the responsibility for not being able to negotiate peacefully. When the government expressed its willingness to negotiate, it had no other ideas and returned to the old path of preconditions. They kept going around in circles, just not wanting the KMT-CPC dispute to have a day of resolution, just not wanting the Chinese political situation to have a day of peaceful unification, and even more not wanting the internal disputes in China to be compromised and pacified due to the mediation of the United States.</p>
<p>Wang Bingnan's words made the Communist Party's intentions, like Sima Zhao's heart, known to everyone. Their only hope is: that the United States' mediation in China will ultimately fail. They can have three kinds of fluke ideas because the United States' mediation has failed: (1) that the United States will be moved by anger, withdraw from China, and no longer care about the affairs of the Far East; (2) that the Communist Party can let go and fight the National Government, fighting for a divided China; (3) that in this Chinese mainland that has become a "vacuum" due to the withdrawal of the United States, it may be filled by the forces of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>We have long understood the Communist Party's desire for the five-person meeting to be stillborn, but the peace elder Marshal Stuart still does not quite believe it. In fact, American friends who are more familiar with the situation in China and the true face of the Communist Party, such as Mr. Powell of the American Policy Association, Mrs. Luce, and Senator Trued, have also spoken out more than once. Recently, they revealed the conspiracy of the Communist Party based on the CCP Central Committee Political Bureau Document No. 16 of March 12, which is even more concrete. We want to ask people at home and abroad to pay attention: if the five-person meeting is stillborn, it is the Communist Party that deliberately made it stillborn, and the responsibility for the Chinese situation not being peaceful should also be borne by the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Six Foreign Ministers' Late-Night Consultation Results in One-Month Postponement of UN General Assembly; Final Vote by Fifty-One Nations</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: Yesterday's foreign ministers' meeting lasted five hours, adjourning only at 1:00 AM this morning. At that time, it was decided that the question of whether to postpone the United Nations General Assembly, scheduled for September 23, to October 23, should be voted on by the United Nations' fifty-one member states. It is understood that the voting method was strongly advocated by Mr. Wang Shijie. Furthermore, after receiving official notification from Paris, UN Secretary-General Lie is expected to solicit the opinions of various member states today.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: British representative Alexander recently received a reply telegram from Foreign Secretary Bevin, expressing his support for the proposal by China, the Soviet Union, France, and Belgium to postpone the United Nations session to October 23. This reply has been immediately forwarded to UN General Assembly President Spaak.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] Last night, the six foreign ministers held a meeting in the study of French President Bidault. The attendees included British representative Alexander, Minister of the Navy, Vice Minister MacNeill, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Vice Minister Vyshinsky, US Secretary of State Byrnes, Senators Vandenberg and Connally, French President and Foreign Minister Bidault, Director of General Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jing Weir, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, and Belgian Foreign Minister and UN General Assembly President Spaak. The governments of China, the Soviet Union, France, and Belgium formally proposed that the next session of the United Nations General Assembly be postponed to October 23 of this year (originally scheduled for the 23rd of this month). The meeting decided that Spaak should immediately notify UN Secretary-General Lie of the decision to postpone the meeting via long-distance telephone to the United Nations Secretariat in Lake Success, New York, and authorized Spaak to contact the representatives of various countries. Yesterday's meeting adjourned late at 1:00 AM, with the representatives of various countries frequently requesting instructions from their governments by telephone, causing the meeting to be interrupted from time to time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] Well-informed sources here said that the four foreign ministers decided to submit the peace treaties currently being drafted with the former enemy states at the Council of Foreign Ministers to the United Nations General Assembly and begin drafting peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Official sources said that the United States has issued a statement declaring that it does not object to the foreign ministers' resolution. The British side temporarily created the demand for postponing the General Assembly but did not take final action, awaiting instructions from British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who has returned to London to attend the Palestine conference. The telegram from the foreign ministers' meeting to UN Secretary-General Lie has been sent to Lie's headquarters on the shores of Lake Success, New York State. It is noted that China, the Soviet Union, France, and Belgium are crowded with this move.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Munich, 8th] After a two-day vacation in Bavaria, Byrnes flew to Paris this afternoon to continue participating in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Byrnes' advisors said that Byrnes believes that the issue of postponement should be decided by a majority vote of the representatives of the fifty-one countries, and should not be decided unilaterally by the four powers.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Agrees to Discuss German Issues; Officials from Four Occupation Zones to Confer on Unified Economy</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: The Soviet Union today agreed to hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the future of Germany. The plan for a central German government proposed by Byrnes in his speech in Stuttgart last Friday will be one of the main topics of discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 8th, Associated Press] Today, the American military administrative officer in Germany, McNaney, requested that in addition to economic unification, the four German occupation zones must also be accused of political unification. His statement is included in his July administrative report.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Stuttgart, Germany, 8th] According to well-informed sources here, the German political leaders in the British, American, French, and Soviet occupation zones will hold a meeting in Kissingen in the American occupation zone to discuss the issue of economic unification proposed by US Secretary of State Byrnes, but it is still unknown whether the German officials in the French and Soviet occupation zones will accept the invitation.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Hold Secret Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Italian-Southern Boundary Issues; Numerous Difficulties in Peace Conference Remain to Be Solved</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: Today, the four powers held a secret meeting to discuss the Italian-Southern border issue. If the four powers can reach an agreement, it is expected that the political and territorial committees on Italy will be able to accept it. It is generally speculated that the four powers will finally agree to the boundary line proposed by France.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 8th] As the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference enters its seventh week, international animosity has reached its peak. Decisions on the Trieste port and the Italian-Southern border still require some debate. Bulgaria's demands for western Thrace in Greece have also become more serious. These two major Balkan border issues have caused conflicts between the Slavic bloc led by the Soviet Union and Western countries in the political and territorial committees of the Italian-Bulgarian peace treaty. The two committees will continue to meet on Monday. In addition, the border dispute between Hungary and Czechoslovakia regarding the border near the confluence of the Hungarian Slavkaga and the Austrian Danube River has also been added to the agenda of the peace conference at the beginning of the week, and Hungary's appeal to prevent Romania from expelling 200,000 Hungarians is also enough to cause fierce debate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 8th] Outsiders have already called the Paris Committee merely a "rubber stamp." In fact, it is difficult to make significant modifications in the committee to the various articles that the four powers have already reached an agreement on, because the majority required to modify a certain proposal is not enough to defeat the united front of the four powers. Of the twenty-six points on which the four powers have not agreed, the most difficult one, such as the Trieste port issue, remains unresolved. In terms of quantity, the Finnish Political Committee has been the most successful.</p>
<h3>Austrian Nationalization Act Takes Effect</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 8th] The Austrian Nationalization Act will take effect tomorrow. The United Kingdom and the United States have requested the Austrian government to postpone the nationalization of factories previously owned by the United Kingdom and the United States in Austria until the compensation issue is resolved. The United Kingdom believes that although Austria has the right to nationalize, the compensation should be reasonable.

<h3>US Renews Broadcasting Law Using Radar Principle; Hundreds of Programs Can Be Broadcast Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] The United States has newly invented wireless broadcasting technology, adopting the "radar" principle of radio wave emission, using the cycle wave to emit a series of radio wave vibrations, replacing the continuous radio waves that are currently used for radio or television broadcasting. This new design allows the same radio station to broadcast as many as one hundred programs at the same time, using cycles as high as nine hundred and thirty large cycles. The only drawback is that the broadcasting range is currently limited to sixty kilometers.</p>

<h3>Palestine Conference to Be Held in London Today; Jewish Groups Express Conditional Participation; Sabotage Cases Occur Throughout Palestine</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The London conference to discuss the Palestine issue is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Lancaster House. The British authorities are making final efforts to get representatives from both the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine to participate, but in any case, the first meeting will only have representatives from the British government and various Arab governments in attendance. A British colonial department spokesperson confirmed this morning that the British government has not yet received a reply telegram from Jewish representatives outside the Jewish Agency in the suburbs, promising to participate in the London conference. Representatives of various Jewish groups in London will design this matter tonight. Arab people in London are waiting for the decision of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee on whether to send observers to attend. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Colonial Secretary Hall met with Prime Minister Attlee today, and both will attend the meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] Jewish sources here announced today that if British Foreign Secretary Bevin can attend the representatives of Arab countries at the London conference and consider establishing a Jewish state in Palestine (but not necessarily immediately), then the Jewish Agency can reconsider refusing to participate in the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 9th] The Palestinian government announced today that saboteurs carried out acts of violence in the dark, using mines and bombs to sever thirty or forty railway lines. The launch of the violence clearly coincides with the start of talks between the British and Arabs in London. In the early morning, some laborers were riding in a car to repair it and triggered a landmine, injuring several people.</p>
<h3>US Government Approves Expanding Trusteeship System to Liberate People Worldwide</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] Mr. Griggs, Director of the Trusteeship Department of the US Department of State, recently delivered a radio address announcing that the United States approves of expanding the scope of the United Nations trusteeship system to cover the entire world. He also said that the world's colonial people, totaling 300 million, of whom 40 million will be liberated by the United Nations trusteeship system in the next few years. As for the territories not included in the trusteeship, advisory committees will also be established in various regions. The United States has decided, in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, to take bases needed for security in various territories around the world. With the efforts of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand, the people who have not been accused of autonomy will be liberated. Therefore, we cannot be pessimistic about the trusteeship issue, because the Caribbean Sea Committee organized by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Tea is enough to constitute a major step in solving this problem. The four countries will also agree to cooperate in an attempt to solve all health, education, and agricultural problems in various territories. From the decision taken by the United States towards the Philippines, we can see that the US government is very willing to assist other territories in gaining independence and promoting the liberation of all people in the world.</p>
<h3>Nehru to Send Invitations to Convene Pan-Asian Conference; Gandhi Calls on People to Unite; Indian Congress Party Opposes Governor-General Presiding Over Constitution-Making</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] It is learned that Nehru, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of India, will soon send invitations inviting all Asian countries to come to India before 1947 to participate in the Pan-Asian Conference, which will be chaired by Nehru himself. In addition to the leaders and representatives of Asian countries, the leaders of national movements in various countries under foreign rule, especially President Ho Chi Minh of the Vietnam government and President Sukarno of Indonesia, will also be invited to participate. At that time, the Pan-Asian Conference will study the relations between Asian countries, especially on economic, defense, and cultural issues.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] According to the BBC, Indian Mahatma Gandhi yesterday called on the people of the country to unite, saying that India needs peace. It is wrong for Muslims to achieve their goals by iron and blood, because the doctrine of Islam lies in peace, not war.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] According to reliable sources, the Indian Constituent Assembly will be held in October. Because the Democratic Party will firmly oppose the convening of the Constituent Assembly by Governor-General Wavell, the Governor-General represents the highest authority in the United Kingdom and cannot participate in the work of the Constituent Assembly, because this is an accident for the entire country. The National Congress Party intends to write to the Governor-General stating its reasons, firmly advocating that the convening of the Constituent Assembly should be led by the leader of the association. In addition, the government also issued a communiqué stating that the Indian government should be called the cabinet from now on. In the past, it was called the Governor-General's Administrative Department, which is enough to cause external criticism, especially the Muslim League, which even called Nehru and his colleagues "British officials."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The Birmingham Indian Association convened a meeting of more than 400 representatives of overseas Indians from all over the United Kingdom, expressing their support for the policies adopted by the Indian National Congress Party.

<p>Muslim League Plans to Take Direct Action</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] The Muslim League Pan-Indian Action Committee is holding a meeting here. A committee member recently told reporters that the purpose of this meeting is to make the Muslim League adopt a wartime establishment. Muslim leader Jinnah will deliver a speech at the meeting this morning, saying that the actual work of the Muslim League is to promote Pakistan (that is, the separation of India and the Muslims) and overthrow the British trusteeship system and the Hindu class. The committee immediately studied the plan to take "direct action" and the consequences of this "direct action" in various provinces of India. The Muslim League also intends to promote the "people's disobedience to orders" movement in accordance with the movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. The parliament is also discussing the supplement of volunteers, planning to reorganize it into a quasi-military organization, so as to prepare to sacrifice for the Muslim mission. In addition, the Governor of India met with Khan, Secretary-General of the Muslim League, today, and warned the Muslim League that the influence of "direct action" may spread throughout the country. People are anxious about the actions that the Muslim League may take.</p>
<p>Some Suggest Seeking Help from Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Reuters, Karachi, 9th] The Muslim League Council of Sindh suggested seeking help from the Soviet Union so that the pain of Indian Muslims can be appealed to the United Nations, believing that the current attitude of the United Kingdom cannot be changed unless it is done this way.</p>

<h3>US Land's Secondary Claim: Armed Maintenance of Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, La Riviera Beach, Northern California, 8th] US Land Secretary Royal has stated: A strong and peace-loving America is the greatest force in preventing war, and the US is intensifying the accumulation of rare materials to prevent another world war from occurring. In addition, plans for rapid mobilization and the training of 4.5 million soldiers have been completed. He said: We are now accumulating, training, and striving to ensure that US weapons production remains ahead of all other countries in the world. The research and application of atomic bombs cannot be abandoned until all other countries in the world have confirmed that they are no longer researching atomic bombs and will never use them. He admitted that the above remarks seemed to be warmongering, but in fact, they were not. The main point is to explain that a weak America is enough to invite aggressive wars.</p>
<h3>New Method of Fly Extermination</h3>

<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 9th] The Christian Science Monitor recently reported that an electrified screen, installed on doors and sufficient to eliminate flies and other insects, has now appeared on the market. This type of screen is made of iron rods and uses a small transformer to conduct current. Insects die immediately upon touching the screen, but it poses no danger to humans or animals.</p>
<h3>US Amphibious Operations Unit to Japan for Landing Exercises</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 9th] According to a report from San Diego: Part of the US Navy's amphibious operations team departed from San Diego on the 7th for Japan to participate in landing exercises conducted by the US Eighth Army in the Sagami Bay area of Japan in late September.</p>
<h3>New York Truckers Strike; Food Supply Faces Serious Crisis; Maritime Union Strike at a Standstill but Not Leading to a General Strike</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] New York, the largest city in the United States, is facing the most serious food and industrial crisis in recent history today, as the truckers' strike shows no sign of resolution. The food supply situation is rapidly declining, and industry has also encountered significant threats due to its inability to obtain raw materials and ship out finished products.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 8th] Hundreds of New York grocery stores plan to close this week unless the strike of 25,000 truckers is resolved. Goods arriving have been greatly reduced for a week, and most stores have begun to lay off employees because they have no goods to sell. Since the seamen's strike, activities have almost completely stopped. According to union sources, at least 15,500 tons of food are still being transported daily, but normally 20,000 tons are moved.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 8th] The impact of the US seamen's strike on industry strengthened today, but it will not lead to a nationwide general strike. Although a certain seamen's leader said that a general strike would occur, the union believes that this threat is "ridiculous." Approximately 1,500 to 1,600 ships have stopped sailing along the coast, and national water transport remains at a standstill. The union is currently delaying, waiting for the Wage Stabilization Board to decide on the 10th whether to withdraw its order to reduce wages and increase standards. Federal Director Garcia stated that the New York Seamen's Union has agreed to notify members to continue sailing federal ships as usual, and hopes that the same method can be negotiated on the West Coast.</p>
<h3>Southeast Asian Food Conference Believed to Be Held in Singapore</h3>

At the same time, ten other international organizations, including national organizations, will ensure their right of first refusal. The items purchased by the United Nations range from ice-making machines to Chinese fishing boat sails.</p>
<h3>International Court Reads Hoshino's Testimony; Purging Japan's Economic Aggression; Japan Exploited Occupied Territories' Resources for Long-Term War</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 9th] At today's Far East International Tribunal regarding Japan's economic aggression, the prosecutor read the testimony of defendant Naoki Hoshino to the US Pacific Fleet Bombing Operations Investigation Office. The content involved the Pacific War, Japan's economic policy toward Manchukuo, and Japan's economic aggression in Korea. The content of the testimony is as follows: (Q) What were the main problems of Japan's war economy after 1942? (A) 1942 was a period of active advancement in the war. The most important issue that year was how to utilize the resources of the occupied areas. It initially proceeded smoothly, but after the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal, it suddenly became unfavorable due to obstructions such as submarines. The industrial production of "Manchukuo" did not develop much in the early stages, but increased rapidly after 1942 because the basic iron and coal industries were completed. One of the purposes of Japan's invasion of the Northeast was to seize mineral and industrial raw materials, and the second was to transplant the population. At the end of 1941, the army and navy had secretly stored oil, believing that they could continue fighting until they obtained oil produced in the South Seas. The utilization of ore in North China was also formally considered. After 1944, Japan and "Manchukuo" strengthened their wartime economies, and the economy of "Manchukuo" cooperated with the war to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] The International Court convened today, and defendant Naoki Hoshino testified, admitting that Japan never hoped to defeat the United States, nor did it hope to invade the United States, but hoped to force the latter to hold peace talks. Japan believed that the United States could not reach the Far East, so it decided that regardless of victory or defeat, rather than withdrawing from China, it would rather fight a war.</p>
<h3>Iran Discovers Reactionary Conspiracy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 8th] British Ambassador to Iran, Mr. Monckton, went to Isfahan in southern Iran yesterday with his wife and daughter for a vacation.

<h3>British Meteor Aircraft Sets Speed Record of 616 Miles Per Hour</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tangmere, Essex, 8th] Royal Flight Captain Donaldson yesterday set a new speed record of 616 miles per hour here in a Meteor jet-propelled aircraft, which is ten miles faster than the original world speed record of 606 miles per hour. The new record has been submitted to the International Aviation Association for approval. However, due to the poor weather yesterday, the organizers plan to hold another test when the weather improves, in order to reach the highest new record of 630 miles per hour. Air Force Fighter Command Commander, Marshal Ross, announced that as a result of the flights of Captains Donaldson and Walter yesterday, the four speeds created by Mr. Tang were 623 miles per hour, 610 miles per hour, 623 miles per hour, and 609 miles per hour. The average is 616 miles per hour, 606 miles per hour, 608 miles per hour, and 620 miles per hour, which are also calculated four times, so the average speed is 614 miles per hour.</p>

<h3>Soviet Purge Movement Spreads to Cultural Circles</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 9th] A new novel by the famous Soviet satirical writer Shashi Chenko, entitled "Memoirs of a Man-Ape," was deemed by the Soviet Writers' Association to "satirize Soviet society unreasonably and ignore the Soviet people's claims during the war" and was therefore "illegal and expelled from membership." At the same time, the female poet Amaduva was condemned for revealing a petty bourgeois boudoir style in her poems. Several other writers were reprimanded for other reasons, and the Writers' Association decided to appeal to all Soviet writers to first promote the Soviet political system, fight against capitalism, and educate young people.</p>

<h3>Opening of Municipal Senate General Assembly; 164 Senators Present; Harmonious Atmosphere; Discussion of Rules of Procedure in the Morning, Mayor's Report in the Afternoon; Hearing of Police and Health Reports Today</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The first general assembly of the city's first Municipal Senate was held at 9:00 a.m. yesterday on the second floor of the Yiyuan Restaurant on Fuxing Middle Road. A total of 164 people, including Speaker Pan Gongzhan and senators, as well as more than ten city government leaders and the mayor, attended. Dozens of alternate senators, newspaper reporters, and guests were present to observe. A total of 341 proposals were received at the conference. The layout of the venue was simple and dignified, with small party and national flags fluttering indoors. The podium faced north from the south, with senators' seats set up in three directions, and the reporter and audience seats arranged on the left and right sides of the podium. After the ceremony at 9:00 a.m., Speaker Pan reported that the conference was originally scheduled for one week, but due to insufficient time, it was decided to change it to two weeks. Regarding the conference schedule, in addition to being printed and distributed, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan recited it again. After Xiang finished, a lottery was held to determine the seat order of each senator. Deputy Speaker Xu Jilong drew one by one, and senators would be seated according to the drawn seat order starting from the second meeting in the afternoon. The meeting officially began at 10:00 a.m. The agenda in the morning was to discuss draft rules of procedure, draft agendas, and draft organizations for review committees, and to elect councillors. The rules of procedure were formulated with reference to the rules of procedure of the provincial senate, with a total of 35 articles. The Secretary-General read them once first, and then the Speaker read them article by article, with senators raising opinions and amendments at any time, and speaking very enthusiastically. Among them, Article 34 "The motions, inquiries, and other documents of this council shall be published after being submitted to the Chairman for approval by the Secretary-General" was deleted, and a new article was added: "Matters not covered by these rules shall be referred to the Preliminary Regulations of Civil Rights." Then, the agenda was discussed. Several senators proposed to postpone the election of councillors. After a vote, it was rejected by 79 votes to 59. After the agenda was passed, the draft list of members of the review committee was discussed. Senators expressed many opinions on the number of groups and the candidates for each group. Some people advocated adding three special review committees for food, transportation, and rent, but only 22 votes were in favor, and it failed to pass. Finally, the candidates for the review committee were determined according to the draft list. Those with opinions could submit them before the second general assembly in the afternoon. By noon at 12:00, after a majority vote, the Chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the election of councillors was changed to the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Resumed Second Meeting in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>At 3:00 p.m., the second meeting continued. After the Speaker announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan recited the minutes of the morning meeting. Then, the supplementary election of councillors began. This was not held in the morning and was postponed to the afternoon. Some senators advocated nomination and introduction, and some senators expressed opposition. As a result of the vote, opponents of nomination passed with 90 votes. (See separate article for election details) Speaker Pan then invited Mayor Wu to give a report.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Policy Report; Problems with Food Registration; Coarse Rice Policy Fails</h3>
<p>Amid enthusiastic applause, Mayor Wu stood up and reported: I am very pleased to be able to attend the Senate today. What I am reporting now is to supplement the shortcomings of the written report. In China, in order to achieve democracy in politics and any other aspect, those who bear administrative responsibility must make honest reports, and even more so must make honest reports on the errors of policy implementation. Therefore, I will now report on the errors in policy implementation in the past three months and the policies that should be implemented in the future as follows:</p>
<p>There have been two major shortcomings in the past three months: (1) lack of knowledge of the current situation in Shanghai, (2) most policy implementations are to deal with temporary emergencies. The report will be divided into two parts. The first part is the handling of emergency events in the past three months, and the second part is the policy direction of each municipal department.</p>
<p>Regarding the first part, the first is the food problem. First, the food registration was organized incorrectly. The method was correct, but the result was problematic because there was duplicate registration. Rice shops, rice companies, rice mills, and warehouses were all registered at the same time. As a result of the registration, Shanghai had a food reserve of 400,000 to 500,000 dans, enough for two months, but in reality it was only more than 200,000 dans, so there was a black market trend at the end of June and the beginning of July. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food were urgently requested to provide assistance, and a telegram was sent to the Chairman to quickly transport Sichuan rice to Shanghai. The city's rice shortage was resolved. Second, the coarse rice policy failed. Coarse rice is indeed more nutritious, but the citizens of Shanghai usually eat white rice, so it could not be implemented. The municipal government has the ability to suppress the price of medium-grade rice and will never allow it to rise. The municipal government owns a large amount of coarse rice, which can be sold at any time. As for white rice, the price will be negotiated. The Ministry of Food will transport Taiwanese rice and Brazilian rice, which will also be sold when necessary to maintain the price of white rice. By the end of September, the price of rice may fall.</p>
<p>Labor Unrest</p>
<p>The second is the issue of labor unrest. Labor unrest is a general phenomenon in the world after the war. The government's policy is labor-management cooperation and increased production. The capital side maintains the labor side's legitimate life, and the labor side observes the capital side's regulations and discipline. The principle regarding wages is that the base salary is not increased, and adjustments are made according to the cost of living index. However, the previous municipal government has already increased the base salary. The municipal government first mediates labor unrest, and then arbitrates. The result of the arbitration must be accepted by both labor and management.</p>
<p>Housing Shortage</p>
<p>The third is the housing shortage. There are three reasons: one is the increase in population. Although the city's household registration survey only shows 3.7 million people, it is estimated that there are as many as 5 million people. The second is the reduction in housing. Many houses were bombed and damaged during the war. The third is illegal occupation. The fourth is illegal leasing. The inevitable result is a reduction in construction, because large landlords have no profit to make, and building houses is not as good as lending money. I hope that the senators will provide more guidance on this point. The current policy of the municipal government is (1) to crack down on illegal occupation, (2) to crack down on secondary landlords and transfer fees, and (3) to encourage construction.</p>
<p>The director of a certain municipal department gave a brief report, saying that since the restoration, the municipal government's staffing and budget have not been finalized, and everything is not easy to put on the right track. The municipal government has now decided that the total number of all personnel must not exceed the sum of the former French Concession Board of Directors, the former Municipal Council, and the former municipal government as a principle. Regarding the social sector, labor unrest has been reported. The Social Affairs Bureau is actively handling relief work, and I hope that all senators will enthusiastically promote it. Regarding the police, the current difficulty is that the number of people is insufficient. The city's police force currently has only 12,000 people and must be increased to at least 15,000 people.</p>
<h3>Today's Agenda</h3>
<p>The Municipal Senate will hold its second meeting this morning, with a report by Police Chief Xuan Tiewu. The third meeting will be held this afternoon, with a report by Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei.</p>
<h3>Few Municipal Schools; High Tuition Fees for Private Schools</h3>
<p>Regarding education, the city's education budget has been appropriately increased from 9% to 19%. The two major difficulties at present are that there are too few municipal schools and private schools charge exorbitant fees. Regarding public works, there are currently two urgent projects: one is to reinforce the seawall and the second is flood control. The municipal government has allocated huge sums of money and has established a urban planning committee to seek improvements urgently. Regarding public utilities, the most difficult problem is transportation. We are now seeking to develop transportation with private capital. Regarding land administration, we will speed up the completion of land registration, reduce land value tax, and protect people's property rights. Regarding hygiene, we will work hard to prevent epidemics and solve sanitation problems. Regarding civil affairs, we will use the Baojia system to complete household registration surveys and assist in sanitation matters. Regarding finance, the municipal government's budget for the 35th year is 30 billion short. How to make up for it and achieve balance is urgently awaiting the senators' contribution of opinions. At present, most of the finance relies on entertainment tax, which is unreasonable. Finally, Mayor Wu made a statement on the case of the liquidation team investigating the municipal government's handling of 4 billion worth of materials from the false Central Market. He expressed a warm welcome to the liquidation team's investigation of accounts and welcomed the Senate's investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jianbai and Jin Zhenyu Elected Councillors; Resolved on Shanghai's Quota; Requested Increase to Nine People</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] After the city councillors Tao Baichuan and Xi Yushu resigned from the position of councillor due to their full-time positions as senators, their vacancies were filled yesterday afternoon in the Municipal Senate General Assembly by Jiang Jianbai (107 votes) and Ms. Jin Zhenyu (83 votes). The election took a non-nominating introduction style. After Shen Chunhui, Wang Zhuyi, Zhu Yakui, Zhu Wende and other four senators supervised the votes and opened the votes, Chen Baotai, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang and other fifteen senators made a temporary motion to ask the municipal government to forward the Central Government to consider increasing the quota of councillors in the city. If calculated according to population ratio, Chongqing has 1.31 million people and 4 councillors, then Shanghai should have 9 people. Former Councillor Tao Baichuan explained that there are three standards for electing councillors: (1) based on population (but not an absolute standard), (2) provinces with provincial senatorships have more quotas, and (3) cities in occupied areas have fewer quotas than those in the interior. However, this is based on wartime regulations, and now the number of senators in the northeastern provinces has increased, and the quota for Shanghai should also be revised. It is also reasonable to request an increase. As a result, it was resolved to request an increase to nine people and ask the municipal government to telegram the Central Government for instructions.</p>
<p>Jiang Jianbai</p>
<h3>Tradition to Be Hired as a Legislator First; Going to Beijing After the End of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] Mr. Fu Tongxian, a city councillor, has recently been hired as a legislator by the Legislative Yuan. This has been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council. According to Mr. Fu, he returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago.</p>
<p>(Top image) Interior view of the venue (Bottom image) A show of hands during voting; Responding to the Municipal Senate's strong request to stay, he still attended this General Assembly and will resign from the position of City Councilor and go to Beijing to take the oath of office after the adjournment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Budget for the Second Half of the Year; Strive to Tighten Administrative Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] It is reported that Shanghai's budget policy for the second half of the year is to first seek the restoration of the city's appearance. All matters relating to the repair of roads and bridges, the police force to maintain public order, and the basic education, culture, and health undertakings for national construction will be relaxed as much as possible. As for administrative expenses, we will strive to tighten them, and all units that have no urgent relationship with the policy direction of the year will be merged and reduced as much as possible to save public funds. Regarding the income side, the current taxes and levies in the city will be the mainstay. However, since Shanghai has just been recovered, there are many things that need to be done urgently, resulting in a huge shortfall in revenue and expenditure. In order to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure, we should formulate adjustment measures and propose new taxes to increase revenue in accordance with the principle of living within our means established by the Central Government.</p>
<p>The estimated ordinary revenue for the second half of this year is 84.7175218 million yuan, of which the current revenue from various taxes and levies is 50.190363015 million yuan. Borrowed income is 1.2 billion yuan, and newly added taxes and adjusted revenue is 33.327158785 million yuan to meet the needs of the undertaking. The adjustment method will be formulated separately and implemented after being submitted to the Municipal Senate for deliberation and decision.</p>
<p>The expenditures for the second half of this year are divided into two major categories: ordinary expenditures and business expenditures. Ordinary expenditures are divided into regular and temporary categories. The regular category is estimated at 5.900464310 million yuan, including a reserve fund of 1.5 billion yuan. The temporary category is estimated at 78.303878790 million yuan, including a living allowance of 44.6502047 million yuan. Business expenditures are estimated at 5.09 million yuan in public business funds.</p>
<p>Tax revenue in Shanghai accounts for more than 80% of the total revenue in the second half of this year. Among them, those listed at more than 5 billion yuan are business tax, banquet tax, and entertainment tax. Those listed at more than 2 billion yuan are land value tax, house tax, slaughter tax, and hotel tax.</p>
<p>The four largest items in the total budget expenditure for the second half of this year are public works expenses, accounting for 21.24% of the total budget, public security expenses, accounting for 20.93%, education and culture expenses, accounting for 19.17%, and health expenses, accounting for 16.07%. This is also the various undertakings that the city urgently needs to carry out.</p>
<h3>Disorder: Hope for More Attention in the Future. Tao Baichuan Points Out Nine Types of Disorder. Councilors Raise Inquiries, and the Mayor Responds with Three Points.</h3>
<p>After Mayor Wu reported on the city government's administration, councilors raised written inquiries, totaling forty-five items. Due to time constraints, the mayor first answered the following three questions orally: (1) Chai Zifei asked: What is the progress of the demarcation issue between this city and Jiangsu Province? After that part of the area is assigned to this city, what are the advantages and disadvantages to the city's finances and public security? Before the demarcation issue is resolved, various bureaus have already started education, civil affairs, and other undertakings in the area. What is the intention? The mayor replied: Regarding the demarcation issue between the province and the city, Jiangsu Province sent personnel to Shanghai to observe and make decisions, but there were no concrete results. Now, we have submitted two more reports urging them to do so. After the provincial government has handled the demarcation, the city’s financial, public security, and other tasks can be actively promoted.</p>
<p>(2) Chai Zifei asked: Collecting "Respect Teachers Money" in elementary and middle schools, a portion of which must be handed over to the city government, seems inconsistent with the meaning of respecting teachers. Has the city government considered this? The mayor replied: The "Respect Teachers Money" in elementary and middle schools is for increasing the number of school classes and should originally belong to the city government. However, nominally, middle schools take increased tuition fees, and elementary schools take "Respect Teachers Money." The name has been considered many times. If it is inappropriate, it can be modified. The treatment of teachers and staff in municipal schools should be the same as that of civil servants, according to central regulations.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Zhusan asked: Regarding the fifth clause in the second item of the municipal gazette's measures for handling labor disputes, which stipulates that factories and labor should hold factory meetings, what is the extent of its implementation since March? If one party does not comply, how should it be handled? The mayor replied: Factory meetings are based on the Factory Law. Since they are stipulated by the central government, they should be strictly enforced. However, despite the laws, it is often impossible to fully implement them in Shanghai. Since March, the city government has not perfectly implemented this case. In the future, all city government regulations will be reviewed by the council, and after a decision is made, they will be handled in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Among the other inquiries, the more proactive ones include: Hou Jiyuan asked: Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Government's Receiving Materials Management Office, for each house (referring to small shops with few people), there are two million yuan in handling fees. What is the effect of the word "handling," and what will this handling fee be used for? Tao Baichuan stated: My impression of the municipality over the past year is that I can't get rid of the word "disorder." Leaving home early, the road traffic is chaotic, the market situation is chaotic, the factories are chaotic, the city government organization has not yet been decided, which is also chaotic, the lack of financial policy is also chaotic, changing mayors twice in a year is also chaotic, the proliferation of central agencies in Shanghai is also chaotic, and the reception situation is even more chaotic. How can we get by if this continues? I hope the mayor will pay more attention to the word "disorder." I don't know if you have noticed it? Zhang Xuelian suggested: Can the mayor be more accessible to the public? For example, the district chiefs should be elected by the district residents as soon as possible. The district chiefs are locals, and the mayor's access to the district chiefs is equivalent to being close to the public at any time, which can not only complete self-government but also reduce barriers. Yang Fusheng asked: How does the city government handle the auction procedures and valuation procedures for the property of the former puppet government? Shi Zongde asked: What is the number of materials confiscated in this crackdown on vendors? How will they be disposed of? Gu Jinzao suggested: The increasing theft at the docks is due to the inability to centrally manage port affairs. However, the anti-smuggling personnel's inability to abide by the law and acceptance of bribes has become a public fact, and there should be concrete measures for the aftermath. Tong Nang asked: Did the Shanghai Municipal Government go through formal procedures for taking over the old two concessions, and for the formal transfer of the property of the two concessions? Wang Nai and Chen Gao asked: What is the nature of the Shanghai Corporation in the city government's organizational system, and what are its main businesses?</p>
<h3>Improving Traffic: Day One. Cars Like Flowing Water, Horses Like Dragons. Shouting and Yelling Are Still Chaotic.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The serious traffic problem in this city has always been the most painful problem for citizens and the most thorny problem for the municipal authorities. Narrow streets cannot be widened immediately, and elevated and tunnel construction is not easy to build in the short term. How can these 200,000 vehicles be arranged? The authorities came up with an improvement method in the absence of any other options. Although it is not perfect, it is still somewhat satisfactory. After weeks of planning and preparation, traffic improvement began yesterday. The police bureau mobilized all traffic police and volunteer police to participate in directing traffic, especially on Nanjing East Road, where there was virtually a post every three steps and a sentry every five steps. Police officers with gold-edged hats and three gold stars constantly patrolled back and forth. Cars and trams moved forward carefully, head to tail, indeed in good order. However, in several notoriously congested areas, such as Risheng Building, Bowling Green, Baidu Bridge, and Nicheng Bridge, cars were still like flowing water, horses like dragons, with shouting and yelling in a mess. On several one-way traffic roads, such as Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, and Sichuan Road, looking along the road during the busiest times for vehicles going to and from offices and at three or four o'clock in the afternoon, it was like a long line of snakes. Sometimes the traffic police were also overwhelmed. For example, pedestrians do not pass in the middle of the designated yellow lines, and cars do not stop on the white lines. These all add to the difficulties in traffic. In addition, rickshaws and tricycles cannot find parking places because the new traffic rules do not allow empty cars to park randomly. As a result, many empty cars are mixed in the traffic flow and squeezed. Rickshaws had their cushions taken away by the police, and they did not know what rules they had broken. After six o'clock, there were fewer cars, the one-way streets were opened, and the police and drivers breathed a sigh of relief. Under the neon lights, 200,000 vehicles continued to gallop. The first day of traffic improvement has passed. Let's see about the second day today!</p>
<h3>Traffic Police Are Overwhelmed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The measures to improve traffic in the central district have been implemented since zero o'clock yesterday. The person in charge of the Traffic Section of the Police Bureau was dispatched to supervise the roads. The Huangpu and Laoza two sub-bureaus each added 120 traffic police officers, and the Xincheng sub-bureau added 30 officers. In addition, Fang Zhichao, director of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, personally went to the central district for inspection yesterday afternoon. Because yesterday was the first day of implementation, many drivers were not accustomed to it, so the situation was still slightly chaotic.</p>
<h3>Two Traitors Sentenced: Chen Bohua and Zhao Yu Are Punished Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court announced the verdicts in two suspected traitor cases yesterday. (1) Chen Bohua, who had served as Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Puppet Ministry of Communications, Counselor of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, and Standing Committee Member of the Puppet Lianglu Special Party Department, was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment. (2) Secret agent Zhao Yu was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment. On the same day, the trials of Qi Huichang, chairman of the Puppet Soap and Candle Industry Association, Xu Shengyang, director of the Xujiahui District Branch of the Puppet Shanghai Baotian Committee, and Qiu Shuxian were concluded, and the verdicts are scheduled to be announced on the 16th.</p>
<p>In addition, several cases were investigated: (1) Chen Shaowei, manager of the Enemy Military Management Hengchan Company, dedicated the Allied property in Shanghai to the enemy and purchased real estate at low prices on behalf of the enemy. (2) Shen Guanquan, acting warden of the Puppet Shanghai Prison, transported prisoners to Sijiaoshan in Ningbo to build military projects for the enemy, resulting in many deaths and disabilities. He also stole and sold a large number of materials left by the Public Works Bureau in the prison. Shen claimed that he was acting under orders. Yesterday, Wu Songgao, the puppet Minister of Justice and Administration, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, was specifically brought to testify and questioned. (3) Tao Zhongli, the former owner of the Oriental Shenqu Theater in this city and head of the enemy gendarmerie's secret agents, and Xue Youwen, a detective from the Puppet Shanghai Putuo Police Sub-bureau, framed our underground workers and the puppet police Zhang Yifeng, Zhang Liansheng, and Gu Jingen. After questioning, all were adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Haiyue Ship Encountered Danger</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to shipping industry sources yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau's Haiyue ship, on its return trip from Haiphong to Shanghai, also stopped at Haikou on Hainan Island. It was anchored outside the port when a typhoon suddenly struck on the 8th, and the ship bore the brunt. The captain of the ship tried his best to save it, but due to the terrifying wind and waves, it was difficult to maintain. The bureau received a report yesterday that the ship had not yet escaped danger, and the ship's anchors and chains had been broken. Further details are still pending. In addition, the China Merchants Bureau dispatched the Haixia ship to open the China-Philippines route. All departure procedures are being processed. The ship is scheduled to sail to Tianjin again next Friday.</p>
<h3>35 Docks Taken Over: Most Have Been Repaired</h3>
<p>The Ditch Engineering Office Will Host Reporters</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The reporter visited Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, at around 6 p.m. last night to inquire about the current status and plans of the Public Works Bureau for repairing docks.

In addition, there is one water dock (which has also been repaired). Director Zhao is preparing to report the above-mentioned dock repair work to the City Council. The small number of docks that have not been repaired are awaiting funding to start construction.</p>
<p>(Another Report) The Qingqu Engineering Office of the Public Works Bureau is scheduled to hold a meeting for reporters from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. tomorrow to report on the progress of [blanks]</p>

<h3>Shui Xiangyun of 76, Also Known as Qiao Tong and Jin Suqin</h3>
<p>Speaker Pan, wearing a grey silk long gown, sat upright on the chairman's platform with a cordial smile. He folded [blanks] at times, his attitude was calm and unhurried. A reporter from a certain newspaper said, "He looks a bit like [blanks]."</p>
<p>When Speaker read the rules of procedure item by item, he took off his glasses. Whenever a councilor stood up to speak, he put them back on. He put them on and took them off again, took them off and put them on again, more than twenty times in total.</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing drew lots on behalf of the councilors to arrange the seating order, drawing a total of 175 times, frequently wiping the sweat from his hands with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>The regulations stipulate that councilors must first report their number and name before speaking, but most speakers ignored this procedure. The first person to report was Mr. Shui Xiangyun, but his number was "Number 76."</p>
<p>Before the election of the senators, someone was distributing the name cards of Jiang Jianbai and Jin Zhenyu in the arena. Jin Zhenyu is the wife of Xi Yushu, and the name card also has the alias Suqin printed on it. A reporter from a certain newspaper said, "Isn't there also a singer called Jin Suqin?"</p>
<h3>Sidelines at the Meeting</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianbai was elected as a senator with 107 votes, and Xi Zhenxia was elected with 83 votes. The first person to be defeated was Lian [blanks] with 46 votes. Someone voted for Yan Huiging with one vote, and someone voted for [blanks] Jin Rong Xu Chedaigu with one vote.</p>
<p>Two votes for Jiang Jianbai were written as Jiang Jian"jian" Bai and Jiang "jian" Bai, and they were counted separately when counting the votes. Fortunately, Jiang Jianbai didn't care about these two votes, otherwise, wouldn't it be "wrongful and unjust"?</p>
<p>The meeting discussed until twelve o'clock in the morning, and the chairman announced that it was getting late and asked whether to adjourn the meeting. Gu Zhuxuan stood up and shouted loudly, "I agree to adjourn the meeting, I'm hungry!"</p>
<p>The mayor's report lasted for a full hour and five minutes, and he [blanks] his head more than ten times during the report.</p>
<p>The councilors asked as many as 40 written questions to the city government. When the chairman [blanks] reviewed them one by one, the mayor borrowed a match from Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau to smoke a cigarette, looking very relaxed, as if he was "confident."</p>
<p>The first councilor to speak was Ma Junshuo, the first councilor from the press to speak was Zhang Zhihan, and the only female councilor was Lu Huimin.</p>
<p>Each seat in the council hall had a pen holder, an inkstone, ink, a writing brush, a pencil, and a [blanks], but if there was no ashtray, it would look a bit like the old days.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, when electing the senators, Miss Xi Yao, the third daughter of Xi Yushu, attended the hearing. She was very happy to hear that her mother had been elected as a senator.</p>
<p>Before the meeting started, the Shanghai Municipal Council distributed a large kraft paper bag to each person, with [blanks] printed inside, which was very convenient.</p>
<p>Xu Jiqing Sweats While Drawing Lots, Gu Zhuxuan Shouts That He Is Hungry</p>
<p>There was a large [blanks] piano next to the chairman's platform in the meeting hall, which was not moved away. The secretariat staff used it as a writing desk, which was "recycling waste."</p>
<p>Most of the municipal councilors took cars to the meeting, and the new and old cars were of various shapes and colors, all parked in Yiyuan Square. However, some councilors also went by tram and on foot.</p>

Regarding the case of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Receiving Materials Management Office being accused, in addition to transferring the accounts sent by the office to the Shanghai Office of the Audit Department for assistance in review, it also sent personnel to the Materials Management Office yesterday to consult the original roster.

<h3>Fellow Villager Is Actually a Bandit: Kidnapping and Extortion Cracked</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Ni Zhaoqing, 27 years old, from Huaian, built a bungalow in Wuling Lane, Dayang Bridge, Zhabei. He originally had a lot of real estate in his hometown. Recently, his family property was destroyed when the countryside was occupied by the Communist Party, so he brought his family to Shanghai to live. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, he met Tan Jiaxi, Xu Dafu, and Zhao Yushan, who were acquaintances from his hometown, at the Sun Temple. Tan knew that Ni was quite wealthy, so he invited him to Yuan Youshao's house at No. 292 Jingjiang Road. Using the excuse that it was difficult to get through the festival, he asked Ni to borrow one million yuan. Ni said that he did not have such a large sum of money, and promised to raise 300,000 yuan, with Yuan guaranteeing payment within three days. When the time came (i.e., the 8th), Ni went to Yuan to explain that he would delay for a few days because he had no money. Unexpectedly, Tan and others led a group to break into Ni's house at 5 p.m. that day, accusing him of hiding "twenty Benke guns and one thousand bullets," forcing him to hand them over. Ni replied that he really had no guns or bullets. They used threats and violent means to tie Ni up and take him to the back of the Dafeng Yarn Factory, hired a ferry to cross to the other side, and then took a tricycle to hide Ni in the Sun family house on Yuyuan Road, planning to extort a large sum of money. After the incident, Ni's younger brother Zhaorui reported to the Zhabei Sub-bureau for help. After the sub-bureau chief personally led the investigation for a day and night, Yuan Youshao was first arrested, and then Xu Dafu and Zhao Yushan were arrested in western Shanghai, and Ni was rescued from danger. Another five suspects were arrested and are being interrogated.</p>

When the robbers carried the stolen goods out the door and tried to escape, Tian Changfu (31 years old), a Hunanese who lived next door at No. 18, happened to return home and met the robbers. Seeing that Tian was wearing two gold rings on his hand, the bandits ordered him to take them off. Tian resisted and shouted "Robbers!", which angered the bandits, who fired a shot at Tian's head. Tian fell to the ground in a pool of blood. At that time, the Penglai Road Sub-bureau had received a report, and Yao Yuanlong, the chief of the criminal section, led the police to rush to the scene, but the bandits had already fled.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Has Decided to Establish Chung Cheng University at Lushan, Possibly Near White Deer Grotto, and Approved the National Education Plan</h3>

<h3>Director Li of the Zhejiang Education Department Announces the Teaching Guidelines for All Levels of Schools; Hopes to Establish More Private Schools to Relieve the Education Famine</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] The autumn enrollment season has arrived in the municipality, and schools are actively enrolling new students. However, due to the difficulty of school restoration after the victory, the capacity is limited, and the number of transfer students in each school is mostly up to twenty (very few) and at least three or four, resulting in a large number of students unable to continue their studies. During this period of high prices and expensive tuition, many have already been excluded from the school gates due to economic difficulties. According to the preliminary estimate of our reporter, the number of those who have not been able to enroll due to the limitation of quotas has reached about 2,000. At this time of national revival, the occurrence of an education famine is a serious problem. Therefore, our reporter paid a special visit to Li Chaoying, Director of the Education Department. Director Li, who has only recently taken office, claimed that he is not yet fully familiar with Zhejiang's education. He also said that since the victory, the flames of war have not ceased, and the government has difficulty in raising funds and is unable to establish new schools. Therefore, he is determined to "emphasize quality over quantity" and devote himself to the education of Zhejiang Province. At present, there are only two universities in Zhejiang Province, Yingshi and Zhejiang, both of which are national. In secondary education, there are only fifteen public schools and sixty-five private schools, with approximately 60,000 students, and 8,640 students are allocated public funds. The future teaching guidelines are "teaching according to talent and combining teaching with application." In terms of normal education, there are eleven provincial normal schools, sixteen county normal schools, and sixty-one simplified normal schools, guiding seventy-six counties throughout the province. The future teaching guidelines are (1) to eliminate the education of slavery and (2) to teach according to local conditions. In terms of national education, there are 2,222 central national schools, 12,256 Bao national primary schools, and 1,514 other primary schools, totaling 15,992 schools, with more than one million children enrolled. The future teaching guidelines are (1) to enrich the content and (2) to improve the quality of teachers. In terms of social education, there are now 101 people's education centers, 22 libraries, 28 gymnasiums, and 1 children's education center in the province. The future teaching guidelines are (1) to promote national integrity and (2) to emphasize the concept of the country. In terms of vocational education, there are six provincial schools, four county schools, and four private schools, all of which are agricultural, industrial, and commercial in nature. The teaching guidelines are (1) to cooperate with local conditions and (2) to connect with industry. As for the relief of the current education famine, the government can only take an assisting attitude. It is particularly hoped that all sectors will establish more private schools and use their own strength to nurture their own children.</p>

<h3>Women's Volleyball Finals, Three Strong Teams Compete Again, You Team Meets Youlian Today</h3>
<p>There Are Two Acts of the B-Group Replay Before the Game</p>
<p>[News from Our Office] The group champions of the B-group of the volleyball league have been produced successively. Starting today, the overall finals will be held. Also, because the You Team, Wuben, and Youlian have created a three-legged situation in the women's group league, they will start a single round robin again today to determine the championship. There are three games in total, starting at 6:15 p.m. at the gymnasium. The tickets are all 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The first game is the replay between the champion of the B-group 5th Division, Huaguang, and the champion of the B-group 2nd Division, Soviet B. The latter is tall and strong, and its technology is not bad, so Huaguang may not be its opponent. In the second game, the champion of the B-group 1st Division, Renyu, will fight against the champion of the B-group 4th Division, Huayan Hua. Renyu has more than enough defense, but lacks attackers, so Huayan Hua is likely to win. In the last game, the three strong teams of the women's group will compete again. Youlian and You Team will play against each other first. You Team was frustrated in the last game when it was most likely to win, and the championship, which was about to be won, became a pending case.

<h3>Questions and Answers on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(70) Question: Should the registration numbers of personnel registration books and application forms be compiled according to the administrative area of the household registration book or the autonomous area within the region?</p>
<p>Answer: Personnel registration is handled continuously at any time. The incidents that occur in each administrative area on weekdays should not be too complicated. For the sake of simplifying procedures, the numbers of the registration book and application form are all compiled according to the administrative area.</p>
<p>(4) Temporary Residence Registration and Migration Population Registration Category</p>
<p>(71) Question: Is the temporary residence registration book the same as the mobile population registration book?</p>
<p>Answer: The constituent conditions for temporary residence registration require residing in one place for more than one month. Those who reside for less than one month are registered as a mobile population. When registering, they should be entered into the temporary residence registration book or the mobile population book according to the time of residence.</p>
<p>(72) Question: Can the mobile population registration book be based on the household registration book, or should a separate book format be used?</p>
<p>Answer: The mobile population book does not generate statistical reports, and the registration book format can be determined by the local authorities.</p>
<p>(73) Question: Can temporary residence registration be incorporated into migration population registration?</p>
<p>Answer: The registration of temporary residents and migrants aims to clarify the actual population of each locality in order to supplement the deficiencies of household registration and personnel registration. Although there are two types of regulations, the registration is not duplicated, and it should still be handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the ministry, without the need for summarization.</p>

The urgent task at present is to guide idle funds and gradually bring them into the market after the opening. Securities prices should gradually stabilize. The completion of this initial task depends on the supervision of the government's competent authorities and the assistance and cooperation of all sectors. In short, the purpose of our market is to curb speculative activities and encourage the concentration of capital. In the future, our exchange must cooperate with national policies to complete its mission. I can guarantee that I will do my best to lead my colleagues to move forward unremittingly in this direction.</p>
<p>From Supervised Progress to Autonomy</p>
<p>Minister Wang said in his speech: The stock exchange is a thorough economic organization. Stock exchanges in the United States and the United Kingdom adopt an autonomous legal system, while stock exchanges in continental Europe adopt a government-supervised legal system. The policy of our government is to temporarily adopt the supervision method. When the foundation of the stock exchange is consolidated and the methods are improved in the future, we will move towards autonomy. I hope that the stock exchange authorities and the brokerage firms will implement the spirit of the rule of law, so that the stock exchange can be successfully completed and the Shanghai Stock Exchange can become a model for stock exchanges across the country.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Finance and Securing People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech: The government's economic policies currently have two goals, namely, stabilizing finance and securing people's livelihood. If the stock exchange is to be run well, it needs to help the government achieve these two goals. The directors, supervisors, assistant managers, etc. of the stock exchange are all leaders in various fields and are highly respected. Therefore, I firmly believe that the stock exchange will be well run. On behalf of the local government, I express my sincere congratulations.</p>
<p>Carefully Select Securities and Maintain Close Contact</p>
<p>Governor Bei said in his speech: The function of the stock exchange is to guide idle funds and support industrial and commercial enterprises. It has a great function. Therefore, I hope that the stock exchange will pay attention to two points in the future: (1) The securities listed on the market should be carefully selected. (2) For the securities that have been listed, I hope that the stock exchange will maintain close contact with the companies that issue them and learn more about the content of each company. Finally, I sincerely hope that the Shanghai Stock Exchange can become a model for stock exchanges across the country.</p>
<p>Supporting the Government and Supporting Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Li Fuxun said in his speech: The responsibilities of the stock exchange are important. On the one hand, it can support the government, and on the other hand, it can support industry and commerce. Therefore, the stock exchange should do its best. I just heard Minister Wang talk about the government's policies for the stock exchange, which will gradually move from supervision to deregulation. I express my admiration for this policy. Looking at the sound and complete stock exchanges in the world today, the first is New York, followed by London. I sincerely hope that China's stock exchange can rank third in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, General Manager Wang delivered a speech of thanks: Today's opening of our exchange has been encouraged and shown great concern by the officials who came to give speeches. I am very grateful. Zhixin followed Chairman Du in preparing for our exchange, and it has been hastily completed. There are many shortcomings. I have also been entrusted to serve as acting general manager. I can only do my best to take charge and adhere to government laws and regulations. I will earnestly abide by the points made by the leaders and strive to do my best. However, I feel that my responsibilities are heavy and my abilities are limited, and I am deeply afraid of failing to meet expectations. In the future, I hope for more guidance to correct my shortcomings. Now, on behalf of the colleagues of our exchange, I express my thanks to the leaders.</p>
<p>Also, at around 11:00 yesterday morning, Chen Jixun, the manager of the Stock Exchange, represented Chairman Du and Acting General Manager Wang, and addressed the guests and brokers in the market with a loudspeaker, saying: The weather is hot today, and I am honored by your presence. However, due to limited space, there are many guests, and I apologize for the many shortcomings in the reception. There will be no ceremony today. Please feel free to visit. The first floor of the exchange is the stock market, the second floor is the bond market, and the third floor is the office. Please visit the market and various facilities. If there are any shortcomings, please offer your opinions for improvement.</p>

<h3>Stock Exchange Will Conduct Drills Today and Tomorrow, One Broker is Limited to Three People Entering the Market, Salespersons are Required to Follow Rules</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Stock Exchange, after opening yesterday, has scheduled drills for today and tomorrow. The morning drill is for market trading, and the afternoon drill is for settlement and account reconciliation procedures. If the drills are satisfactory, it is decided to officially start trading on the 12th. However, the staff of the Stock Exchange's Market Affairs Department began practicing their work in the market yesterday afternoon. The first batch of securities to be traded are the 20 types of Chinese stocks that were disclosed in yesterday's newspaper for trial listing.</p>
<p>When the stock market officially opens, each broker can have a maximum of three people enter the market (including one broker, one agent, and one telephone operator each). Other people are not allowed to enter the market. As for the salespersons affiliated with each broker (i.e., the so-called securities firms and small companies), the Stock Exchange will also convene a board meeting within days to make regulations. The salespersons affiliated with each broker must be registered with the Stock Exchange. If any illegal behavior is found by the salespersons, the Stock Exchange will notify the affiliated brokers to stop it. Otherwise, the affiliated brokers will be punished. At the same time, the government will also be asked to assist in eliminating the black market trading of stocks.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday afternoon, the staff of the Stock Exchange's Market Affairs Department began practicing their work in the market.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the sharp rise and fall of stock prices, the Stock Exchange has recently stipulated that there are daily price limits for each type of security. The regulations are based on the following standards: (1) For stocks with a price below 100 yuan, the price limit is 20%. (2) For stocks with a price between 100 yuan and 5,000 yuan, the price limit is 15%. (3) For stocks with a price above 5,000 yuan, the price limit is 10%. The daily price limits for each type of security will be announced by the exchange on a daily basis before trading. All transaction prices must not be higher than the announced high price limit or lower than the announced low price limit. If this limit is reached, the exchange will suspend the trading of that security for the day.</p>
<p>Opening of the Stock Exchange (Brokers and Guests in the Market)</p>
<h3>People Excited About Stock Exchange Opening, Unpopular Small Stocks Showed Best Performance</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were excited about the opening of the stock exchange, especially the unpopular small stocks were the most popular. The shortage of chips led to the most active and strongest gains. The popular stocks opened firmly in the morning, but later due to the trading of popular stocks for unpopular ones, there was more lock-in, and there was also no lack of profit-taking at high prices. As the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, the money market tightened in the middle of the day and saw a decline. The unpopular small and medium-sized stocks were still strong and unmoved. The popular stocks also saw lower prices at the close. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongsheng Yarn rose slightly, Meiya was slightly lower, and Jingwei was stable. Xinguang rose by half a percent, and the less popular medium-sized stocks were stable and changed.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks slightly declined from high prices. Yishas' yarn opened at 10,300 yuan, but the trading volume was small. Except for Zhiya and Yipi stocks, which had news of applying for listing and slightly rose, they were all dragged down. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Ye Guanggang's shares fell by a weak half a percent. Although Yisha and British United Airlines fell not much, Jardine Matheson was flat, and Yipi Zhiya rose by about half a percent.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Hovered</p>
<p>Government bonds hovered yesterday. Someone came to the 7th floor to trade, and it was slightly popular in the middle of the day. There were many longs taking profits on the 5th floor, and it fell back after the high. Tong Bing opened at 2,450 yuan in the morning, and once rose to 2,580 yuan. Many longs took profits at high prices, and it fell back to below 2,300 yuan in the middle of the day. It finally struggled at around 2,350 yuan. As a result, it rose by 100 yuan compared with the previous close. Jia Yi rose slightly by 20 yuan, Ding fell by 50 yuan, and Tong Wu fell by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shops Open as Usual During Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all banks and money shops in the wood market will still be open as usual. Bill and note exchange will also be exchanged as usual. It is reported that the money market has been slightly looser than in the past few days because the banks that handle loans have released a lot of small industrial loans recently, and idle funds have been slightly more active, so all banks and money shops can safely pass the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Sound Securities Market (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yang Yinpu</p>
<p>B. Expanding the Funding Source Base Investors who have funds for long-term investment know that the existence of a market means that they can recover their funds at any time. They have no worries when investing, so they can invest as much as they can. This allows those who hold long-term funds to fully supply long-term funds. This is one aspect. Those who have funds for short-term use can take advantage of the existence of the market to conduct securities arbitrage and earn risk-free profits; short-term investors are also not worried about not being able to recover their funds when they need them. In this way, a portion of social short-term funds can also be used to meet the needs of the long-term market. This is another aspect. Idle funds are scattered in society, seeking a way out. They will go here if it is easier to make a profit, and they will go there if it is more dynamic. The conditions of the securities market are generally quite suitable for the needs of those who hold such idle funds. It is possible to guide a portion of the idle funds in the market and put people on the right path. This is another aspect. In short, the existence of a formal market allows funds that do not have long-term characteristics to flow into the long-term market; allows flames that originally had long-term characteristics to be used more fully and without worries. Expanding the base of funding sources increases the amount of funds that can be absorbed. This is its second function.</p>
<p>C. Indicate Effective Investment Paths The market quotations issued by the sound securities market every day are a good indicator of investment paths. The long-term trends of various securities market prices can generally be regarded as a reflection of the prosperity and decline of the respective enterprises. Moreover, the exchange often conducts precise investigations on the listed securities. This credit investigation material, if used well, can be of reference value when investing. In short, the market price of a sound market is the crystallization of the concrete opinions of the majority of actual operators, and invisibly has the power to influence market investment. The existence of the market leads to hints of investment paths, thereby affecting investment trends. This is its third function.</p>
<p>3. The Necessity of Future Efforts</p>
<p>If the securities market is to fully exert its functions, it must first seek the soundness of its own organization, which depends on efforts in many aspects.</p>
<p>A. Soundness of the Market Itself In this regard, there are three aspects that should be given special attention: (1) Strive for meticulousness in market management; (2) Devise ways to improve the level of operation; (3) Select listed securities carefully.</p>
<p>(1) Strive for meticulousness in market management The layout of the new market should strive for modernization and make use of mechanical equipment as much as possible to reduce the chaos when trading is done in the market and increase the efficiency of business processing and message transmission. All illegal actions in the past, such as private off-market transactions, repeated "flying accounts," trying to evade transactions, agents doing their own buying and selling, outsiders mixing into the market, intentionally raising or lowering the market price at the close, etc., damage the credibility of brokers and also damage the credibility of the exchange, and should be strictly prohibited. It is also extremely important to check brokers' accounts from time to time, and for the brokers' association and brokers to actively assist in making continuous improvements to market affairs.</p>
<p>(2) Devise ways to improve the level of operation Help brokers gradually improve their general level of operation, so that brokers' credibility in society will become more and more important; to assume the major responsibility of regulating long-term funds. We should shift some brokers' concepts of near-term and high profits, and pay more attention to the cultivation of strength and credibility to make long-term plans. On the one hand, under the premise of considering the interests of customers, give play to their service spirit; on the other hand, under the new understanding of maintaining the stability of the securities market, change their trading style. This will surely bring a new vision to society and put the securities business on the right track. This depends on the advocacy of the Exchange and the self-awareness and struggle of brokers.</p>
<p>(3) Carefully select listed securities The most important task of the securities market is to benefit the market and channel funds into proper investment paths. If the securities selection is improper, sound and proper enterprises that should be assisted are rejected, while the securities issued by enterprises that are full of fluke and risk-taking fill the market. Not only does it lose the original intention of creating a stock exchange, but it also promotes speculation and cannot escape the blame for wasting social capital. The selection of the types of listed securities is the selection of the types of enterprises to be assisted. Those who are allowed to be listed can obtain the funds they need through the market through the securities they issue; those who are not allowed to be listed cannot use this only institution for financing long-term funds. Therefore, in this regard, the degree of soundness of the future development of the exchange's business can be measured by the degree of appropriateness of the selection of its listed securities as the most accurate test standard. The more appropriate the listing selection, the sounder the development of its business will inevitably be.</p>
<p>B. Guiding Company Organizations The object of market transactions is securities, and the issuance of securities relies on companies. Therefore, developing company organizations is a prerequisite for developing securities and developing markets. With sound companies, there are sound securities, and there may be sound markets. The more sound companies there are, the more sound securities there are, and the more opportunities there are for the sound development of the market. Conversely, due to the existence of the market, securities have the convenience of circulation; due to the convenience of securities circulation, company organizations and securities issuance have been effectively stimulated. Therefore, the sound development of the securities market itself is an important factor in guiding company organizations. Moreover, the Exchange has the power to review the listing of securities. If used properly, it can not only affect the business policies of some existing companies, but also imply the path that future new companies should take, that is, it has an impact. How to use this indirect force to gradually guide company organizations to the right track, so that their internal mechanisms gradually become strict; accounting systems gradually become sound; financial conditions remain fluid; and company content gradually becomes public, so that they know that what gains the position of the market is what gains the belief of society. In this direction, there is indeed the possibility and value of adding effort.</p>
<p>C. Advocating Issuing Institutions Although securities trading institutions have been established after the official opening of the Exchange, the support institutions needed when securities are first issued are still lacking to this day. Such as capital raising on behalf of companies at the time of establishment, acting, underwriting, or private placement when companies issue stocks and bonds, in addition, such as maintaining the market for securities sold on behalf, and assisting in the listing of securities already issued, etc., should be contacted with national financial institutions that have special tasks in this regard, such as the Central Trust Bureau and the Bank of Communications, so as to advocate. With issuing institutions as the assistance of enterprises, the difficulties when securities are first issued can be solved; there is a buying and selling market to maintain its market, and the ability of securities to circulate continuously can be maintained. The two are indispensable and complement each other, so in this regard, there is also a need to add effort.</p>
<p>D. Correcting Wrong Ideas Society in general has wrong ideas about exchanges and brokers because they do not understand them properly. For example, they regard the exchange as a purely speculative place, as a wealth-making institution, and the brokers as the initiators of market speculation, as rumor-mongers, etc. Various rumors gradually become public opinion. It is necessary for the exchange authorities and brokers to work hard to show the facts, I am afraid that it will not be enough to correct this deep-rooted misunderstanding for a while. This requires special effort, and it is even more urgent. (End)</p>
<h3>Establishing an Investment Market - A Talk by Supervisor Wang</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter interviewed Wang Aotang, the supervisor sent by the Ministry of Finance to the Stock Exchange yesterday. He stated that he was appointed as the supervisor of the Stock Exchange by the Ministry's order last Saturday. However, because the supervision laws and regulations and the regulations on responsibilities have not yet been formally promulgated, it is inconvenient to make unfounded statements. However, he firmly believes that the government must have a minimum expectation for the Stock Exchange, that is, to hope that the Stock Exchange can become an investment market, not a speculative market, so as to establish a sound capital market and guide social funds into the right path. The personnel who are in charge of the Stock Exchange this time are all carefully selected. They should be able to use their strengths to serve the industrial and commercial circles wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Tea Market is Strong</p>
<p>B.P.P. The Indian traders are not hesitant to seek good prices for the fine Taiwanese red tea, but due to the long depletion of stock, the industry has contacted the producing area to inquire about the situation to purchase. For other colors, exporters are still keen due to the imminent shipping schedule. The production of Bai Lin new red tea has stopped in the producing area, so the idea of hoarding and speculation has doubled. The closing price has reached a new high. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, the Taibei shops and the Suzhou and Wuxi areas are still continuously buying.</p>
<h3>New Xian Rice Arrived in Large Quantities, Oil Market Supply is Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market's digestion turned sluggish. The market sentiment was still firm in the early market. A considerable amount of new Xian rice arrived. More than 10,000 stones were registered in the north and south markets. Sellers competed to sell. Du Xian rice fell sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and Anjian rice also fell slightly by 1,000 yuan. The new Japonica rice was nominally firm but secretly sluggish. High-quality Bai Yuan rice was still stable, but there were few buyers in Zhongguan. Transactions were quite rare. The new Yin Yuan rice continued to arrive sporadically, forming a situation of rising and then falling. Old Japonica rice has dropped, and new rice is mainly traded. The flour shop's digestion was weak, and it rebounded by 300 to 400 yuan. Bran was continuously connected to the countryside for digestion, and the price rose step by step, rising by another 100 to 200 yuan. Buyers from Nanyang, Fujian, Ningbo, Shantou, and Xiamen eagerly purchased wheat, but the source was not large, and the price rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. It was still strong, but the sales of white wheat were normal because the north was not moving. The high-quality soybeans in Shantou were slightly picked up, but the second-grade and lower-grade soybeans arrived in large quantities. The digestion was light, forming a situation of high prices and sluggish sales. Both the arrival and sales of broad beans were weak. The high-quality goods were firm, but the medium and low-quality goods were flat. The price of corn in Qingdao did not move. Groundnuts were once again inquired about in Nanyang, and the price rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The oil market's supply was in short supply, and the shops were active, rising by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan step by step.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Applied Amounts in Full; Yesterday's Yarn Allocation Maintains Original Price; Spot Market for Loans Rises Again by 100,000 Yesterday; Cotton Fabric Sales Revive, but Leading Brands Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Mill Joint Sales Committee held its sixth committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. All committee members attended and immediately resolved: to open sales of 2.763 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn at the standard amount, with full allocation according to application amounts. The selling price is set at 1.3 million yuan per piece, based on the standard of 400 pounds of Shuang Ma (Double Horse) 20-count yarn, maintaining the same original allocation price as the previous time. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, the next sales opening date is rescheduled to the 13th.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to rise. Both coarse and fine yarns surged upwards. The spot price of 20-count yarn rose by 35,000 yuan. Shuang Ma (Double Horse) yarn returned to the 1.6 million yuan mark, with the final transaction at 1.62 million yuan. Market sentiment was bullish. Sales of 20-count miscellaneous brands and 16-count yarn were exceptionally smooth. Because the Jian Yu (Construction?) mill had not allocated 42-count yarn, the inventory of the same types of goods among dealers was extremely scarce, leading customers and fabric mills in need to raise prices in search of supply. Prices rose gradually from 2.32 million to 2.4 million yuan, an increase of over 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 31-count Yin Yue (Silver Moon) yarn was being collected by Guang Bang (Guangdong dealers), and the price rose back to 1.7 million yuan. Overall, transactions in the market were based on spot goods, indicating genuine sales. As a result, no one paid attention to the warehouse receipts for forward goods allocated by the mills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday the market speculated that the China Textile Mills (Zhong Fang) had been opening goods with skipped allocations, while yarn shops had not received a single package in two weeks. Yarn shops generally believed that there was little hope for yesterday's allocation, so market sentiment was uniformly optimistic. Additionally, various dealers had a strong appetite. If Shen Fang (Shanghai Textile Mill) were to loosen credit, the price of goods would definitely approach the opening price. As for the fabric market, due to Zhong Fang not fully allocating twice recently, and the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, both long and short positions had been squared. The Jin Lian Miao Wu (Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance) fabrics that arrived the day before were prepared for filling in. Later, the Hankou dealers raised prices to collect them, with a price difference of 4,250 yuan. Sellers slightly sold off, and then the price rose to 5,000 yuan. Many were collecting. Because of sluggish sales, the leading brand (Long Tou) showed no improvement, and the price remained at 64,000 yuan. Wu Fu (Five Blessings) increased by 5,500 yuan. According to sources close to He Dao (Hedo) Trading, the market price of cloth, before the foreign exchange adjustment, could be sold for 2.600 NT dollars. At an exchange rate of 27 yuan, this equaled 70,200 legal currency. Now, after the adjustment, the market price in that area has fallen to 2,000 yuan. Although the exchange rate has improved, the legal currency is more than 3,000 yuan higher. However, based on the price level in Shanghai, there is no profit to be made.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>Artificial silk opened this morning at 2.75 million yuan for 120-count Tian Qiao (Sky Bridge) Guang (Bright) brand, but due to a lack of buyers, it declined. In the end, it closed at 680,000 yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan compared to last weekend. In the afternoon, sellers were asking 700,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Miscellaneous Guang (Bright) brands were down 50,000 yuan, while semi-bright and other brands remained unchanged. Transactions were very rare. Although factory dealers had few transactions, due to loose credit, there was no shortage of buyers inquiring. Yesterday's prices were all raised. High uniformity was raised by about 100,000 yuan. A few packages of ordinary five-dan goods were transacted at a price of 2.4 million yuan, an increase of about 150,000 yuan compared to last week. Dried goods also saw a price increase of 50,000 yuan. The overall trend for goods remained stable. However, Hua Jin (China Brocade) crepe was down 50 yuan due to abundant spot goods.</p>
<h3>China Trust to Purchase Raw Silk Starting Today</h3>
<p>Regarding the government's purchase of raw silk, it has been decided to implement it starting today. The Central Trust Bureau will purchase the silk, initially calculating based on the "kou" (口) grade, paying 3.8 million yuan per dan (担). It will be handed over to the Central Bank, which will deduct the amount owed by the factory from the loan. Half of the remaining amount will be deducted as a 30% advance for autumn cocoon loans, and the other half will be returned to the manufacturers. It is reported that the first batch of raw silk to be purchased is about 4,000 dan. Subsequent purchases will be settled as they arrive.</p>
<p>Coal Allocation for Silk Mills to Continue</p>
<p>In order to solve the fuel difficulties of member factories in the silk reeling industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the Third District Silk Filature Trade Association requested an allocation of coal from the Fuel Committee. After several rounds of negotiations, the Fuel Committee approved an allocation of 1,700 tons of coal, which will be distributed by the trade association according to the amount of spring cocoons reeled. The price is 99,000 yuan per ton. The allocation will be made this week, ensuring that silk mills will not lack fuel for reeling after purchasing autumn cocoons.</p>
<h3>American Lumber Arrives in Shanghai; Totaling Over 4 Million Feet</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fortune Shipping Company's manager announced that the ship "Cecil H. Holmes" arrived from Houston and Seattle carrying 2 million feet of lumber, and 32,000 boxes of relief milk powder. In addition, the company's "Demmanmenf Hentuo" also carried 2 million feet of lumber, and 2,023,000 feet of lumber. This was Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) lumber. The ship first went to Qingdao to unload before sailing to Shanghai, and it is expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal and Hongji Dust Sales Gradually Become Active</h3>
<p>The white coal market remains firm and popular, with prices steadily at a high peak. Sales of various bituminous coal grades are gradually becoming active. According to statistics from the Coal Business Joint Sales Office, only over 8,000 tons were allocated last month, while this month, the daily allocation has been in the range of 500 to 600 tons. The main raw material for briquettes, the Economic Ministry's Fuel Committee, reduced the allocation price by 10,000 yuan this month. As a result, various briquette factories have increased the coal content or reduced the selling price. Due to the impact of foreign exchange adjustments, the selling price of various liquid fuels has increased, causing more users to adopt briquettes. Therefore, various briquette factories are actively applying to the Fuel Committee for the allocation of Hongji dust (Hongji mining coal dust).</p>
<h3>Gold Price Rises Slightly, US Dollar Falls Slightly; Market is Full of Stability</h3>
<p>The ingot market was also very stable yesterday. It suffered a slight setback due to pressure from the Central Bank, but market sentiment remained stable and sustainable. It opened at 2.125 million in the morning, and then there was pressure. It gradually declined from 2.13 million, retreating to 2.105 million before stabilizing and slightly rising. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 81 bars at a price of 2.12 million. After that, it returned to stability. Credit was stable, and market sentiment was optimistic. At noon, it stood at around 2.13 million. In the afternoon, next-day delivery continued to rise to above 2.05 million. The Central Bank continued to respond before it slightly leveled off. As a result, it was 34,000 better than last Saturday. Ornamental gold also rose to 22,900. Sycee silver was flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. Black market interest rates ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 jiao (角).</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were calm, and the situation showed signs of exhaustion. US dollars opened at 3,450 yuan for sale in the morning, retreating to 3,420 yuan. After that, it consistently hovered around 3,430 yuan, with no significant change. In the afternoon, the gold market showed much encouragement, advancing to 3,450 yuan. As a result, it was slightly down 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars once fell to 680 yuan in the middle of the day, then rose to over 700 yuan. As a result, it was 5 yuan lower than last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was similar. Indian exchange rate was 825 yuan to 835 yuan. In the afternoon, there were buyers but no sellers. The British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan to 11,500 yuan. The US exchange rate still stood around the posted rate.</p>

<h3>This Year's Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Written by Our Reporter Ping Qi, Photography by Chuang Shuo</p>
<p>This year's Mid-Autumn Festival is quite different from previous years.</p>
<p>First, the weather is exceptionally hot. Tonight, there must be many Shanghai residents sleeping on sidewalks, who need only turn slightly to look up at the bright moon.</p>
<p>Second, what deserves special mention is that Guanshengyuan mooncakes actually sold out yesterday afternoon, with many customers lining up to wait. This sight has probably not been seen in many years. No matter what everyone says about the decline in people's livelihoods, the purchasing power this year is indeed somewhat higher than in previous years.</p>
<p>Third, we may record a few prices: Rice, 60,000 yuan per dan (担); the largest mooncake, 500,000 yuan; ordinary "luo pen huo" (落盆貨, common breed) crickets, 20,000 yuan each, exactly the same as the price of a dinner at the International Hotel's 14th floor, but in addition to this 20,000 yuan meal fee, a 30% donation is required.</p>
<p>Fourth, before last year, Shanghai did not have jeeps or the so-called "atomic tigers."</p>
<p>However, this year's Mid-Autumn Festival is still not different from previous years. War fires are everywhere, and cries of sorrow are heard all around, no better than before. When "looking down and thinking of home," just like in previous years, the heart is still heavy!</p>
<p>Image Captions</p>
<p>(1) The Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived, and the mooncake boxes in the shops are stacked very artistically, like skyscrapers, or like ancient fortresses!

<h3>"Anonymous" Gentleman Donates a Large Sum and Proposes Launching an Emergency Loan Fund Campaign</h3>
<p>This Column Expresses Strong Support, but Sufficient Funds Must Be Raised in Advance</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editors: Your newspaper has spared no effort in advocating for social services, which is truly touching for all in Shanghai! Recently, it has often been heard that there are emergency cases requiring immediate surgery, but due to being sent to the hospital late at night, patients are unable to pay in cash, which often delays treatment and even leads to death. I feel extremely regretful about this! I am sending 2 million legal currency, requesting your newspaper to handle a temporary guarantee method to avoid delaying emergency treatment. (1) For emergency cases sent to the hospital for surgery, etc., where cash cannot be paid late at night, this fund will serve as a guarantee; (2) Please have your newspaper preside over all methods, such as how to notify the hospital, how to quickly contact the guarantee, etc.; (3) If 2 million yuan is not enough, please notify "Anonymous" in your newspaper's social services column, and I will immediately send more; (4) The trial period is tentatively set for three months. In short, I sincerely hope that you will approve the trial operation. With respectful regards for your well-being in the summer heat. "Respectfully submitted by Anonymous"</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) After receiving the letter and donation from "Anonymous," this newspaper believes that the intention is good and worthy of advocacy. Recently, there have been facts of patients losing their lives because their families could not pay in cash. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to plan ahead and find ways to remedy this situation. The colleagues in this column have discussed this matter and all agree that in a large city like Shanghai, emergency cases are often heard of. If we follow the proposal of "Anonymous," it would not be easy to cope without a fund of 20 million yuan. Therefore, it has been decided to first disclose the original letter, hoping that "Anonymous" will continue to solicit donations, and that enthusiastic readers will contribute within their means. If a substantial amount can be raised within a week, we will immediately formulate regulations and proceed with the matter as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will return this amount to the original donor or transfer it to another donation. As the ancients said, "Although it may not have a beginning, it can have an end." It is better to be cautious from the start than to continue halfway without sufficient strength. We believe that "Anonymous" and the readers will understand this. (The Editor)</p>
<h3>Recruiting English Teachers</h3>

<h3>High School and College Students: Trachoma Goes Unnoticed; Examination Will Reveal It</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: I am a student who has trachoma, but I did not know it beforehand. Recently, due to taking the college entrance examination, I learned that I had trachoma after a physical examination by the school. Today, I received a letter from the school stating, "You should cure it yourself before the start of school, and then come to the school doctor's office for re-examination to be eligible to register and enroll." After receiving this letter, I felt very distressed because it is difficult to get into college this year. Wouldn't it be a great pity if I were rejected because of trachoma? I know that your newspaper's social services column has a charitable initiative to provide free treatment for trachoma for students, and I admire your newspaper's spirit of serving society. Unfortunately, the registration date has passed. If you, sir, can forgive my plight and allow me to register for treatment again, I would be endlessly grateful. With respectful regards for your well-being, Yours sincerely, Wu Houxing</p>
<p>Registration for trachoma prevention and treatment has already been closed after reaching the quota. Considering the special circumstances of this student, we have obtained the consent of Director Wang of the Relief Hospital to grant a special accommodation. Please come to the clinic for an interview as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Colleagues at Lian Shang Bank Save Mooncake Money to Help Those in Need</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Our colleagues at the bank have saved a small amount of money from mooncake expenses, totaling 100,000 yuan, and would like to donate it to the loan fund for the lonely, widowed, poor, and sick. Although we are small merchants with a meager income, more than a dozen of us at the bank are all like brothers, and at the same time, we think that each of us is a cell of society and should not only work hard to solve our own food and clothing, but also think with a loving heart. If everyone can think of the greater good, not be selfish, and walk on the path of loving others as ourselves, we believe that everything can be solved. This is our hope.</p>

<h3>Repercussions of the Land Reform Theory</h3>
<p>On August 28th, I expressed dissatisfaction with the land reform article advocated by the Land Administration Society. Now, I will briefly state my reasons as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The original text stated that after land reform, the majority of farmers can achieve a life of peace and happiness, as if the inability of farmers to live in peace and happiness is entirely caused by landlords. This is truly unjust! Facts tell us that the inability of farmers to live in peace and happiness is actually due to the following reasons: (1) inflation, (2) soaring prices, (3) social unrest, (4) heavy taxes, and (5) high-interest loans in rural areas. To be honest, the living conditions of good landlords in recent years are not much different from those of farmers (in the occupied areas, the plight of loyal landlords is beyond description). The truly comfortable people are corrupt officials, profiteers, and district and bao chiefs. Now, the Land Administration Society, disregarding the actual situation, pushes the inability of farmers to live in peace and happiness onto the heads of good landlords. Isn't this extremely unfair?</p>
<p>(2) The value of bonds is not as good as before. The one-to-one redemption of government bonds is clear evidence. Now, collecting land with land bonds is just a nice name, better than nothing, but in reality, what difference does it have from confiscation? Even traitors who collude with the enemy are allowed to keep some living expenses and are given preferential treatment. But now, we want to deprive the source of livelihood of good landlords who have been oppressed by the enemy and have not made war fortunes or victory fortunes. There is nothing more unfair than this!</p>
<p>(3) The system of perpetual tenancy rights and the regulations on 25% rent reduction already provide great benefits to farmers. If taxes can be reduced, the value of money stabilized, and high-interest loans abolished, then the peaceful and happy life of farmers can be expected in the near future. Why make things difficult for small landlords?</p>
<p>In short, in this era of declining morality, it is better to do less than more. We will only give intermediaries an opportunity to make money, and law-abiding small landlords can only sit and wait for death. How can we achieve social stability in this situation? I hope that our wise authorities will deeply understand the hardships of the people, and then our people will surely be grateful to the end. (Xu Bai)</p>
<p>The Cry of Refugees from Taixing</p>
<p>Dear Editor: The relief flour that the poor people of Taixing have been longing for has been delayed for months before it can be transported to Taixing. The first batch of flour issued was only four catties for large families and two catties for small families, which is not enough for the poor to eat for a day. Such relief is truly a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem! If the poor people have to rely on relief flour as their staple food, the people must die in large numbers! What is most strange is that wealthy families have received many bags of flour, while most of the poor have not received any flour at all! Now, it is reported that the second batch of flour has arrived, and it is said that only two catties will be issued per person. Talking about relief in Taixing is truly tragic! The government and local authorities urgently distributed a total of 70 million legal currency in disaster relief funds for the two phases of the war disaster. According to a public notice published by the Relief Association, more than 15 million yuan in relief funds have been issued. How the rest of the funds will be distributed is still unknown.

<p>Public Water Taps Have Been Opened</p>
<p>August 30th Your newspaper's readers' opinions column published a section where citizens Zhao Yongnian and others requested the installation of public water taps on Meijia Bridge Lane, Zhuan Anbang, East Jiangsu Road. The water pipes laid in the Jiangsu Road area have small diameters, resulting in insufficient water pressure and difficulty in water output. If more taps are installed, it will inevitably affect the taps in the vicinity. Therefore, it is currently difficult to install taps in that area. However, in order to take care of the drinking water of the poor, our bureau has now notified the Shanghai Waterworks Company to open the fire hydrants at (1) Zhuan Anbang, East Jiangsu Road, (2) Zhongzheng West Road (between Dihua Road and Jiangsu Road), and (3) near Magu Village, Jing'an Temple Road free of charge to meet the urgent need. Please publish this notice to the Shen Bao newspaper office. (Municipal Public Works Bureau)</p>

<h3>The Various Aspects of Love</h3>
<p>— Yan Juan</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Love</p>
<p>If there is no love in human life, it is like removing green from nature, which spoils the scenery so much. In human society, if love is dried up, it is like skeletons dressed in clothes, like packs of jackals and tigers. Therefore, love gives warmth and color to life.</p>
<p>Love can be roughly divided into romantic love, maternal love, and friendship. The promotion and brilliance of these loves make human life unfold a colorful picture. Therefore, poets sing of it, and all of humanity praises it in various languages. I dare not make a comprehensive discussion of this profound and complex issue of love. I will only contribute some opinions from a physiological perspective.</p>
<p>(2) Sexual Love and the Cult of Romantic Love</p>
<p>The instinct of sexual desire brings the opposite sexes closer together. Initially, it is a vague yearning for the opposite sex, gradually entering into admiration and finally romantic love.</p>
<p>Choosing a unique object based on an ideal is the spiritual prerogative of mankind. Animals do not have this choice; as long as it is the opposite sex, it is their object. Human love adds a beautiful spiritual function to the sexual desire aspect, so romantic love can also be divided into many kinds. Some fall into pathological perversion, some are close to licentious games, and pure love is really a necessary thing for reproduction. It can make mankind move upward. However, perverted love and playful love are enough to harm mankind.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the cult of romantic love are really the ultimate in spiritual games. They believe that nothing in the human world is more noble or supreme than romantic love. This is really a wrong concept. Pure romantic love is indeed worthy of respect, but to think that it is supreme and indulge in it is completely a game of pursuing pleasure. In any case, we must not forget the eternal life, that is, the prosperity of the race.</p>
<p>(3) Maternal Love and Other Loves</p>
<p>Whether mothers or fathers, there is no one who does not love their children. The love of parents for their children is generally called maternal love. Maternal love is different from romantic love, but it also originates from the instinct to preserve the race.</p>
<p>Maternal love is purer than romantic love. Romantic love is mixed with competition and vanity, but maternal love does not have this ingredient. The extension of maternal love is like a grandmother's love for her grandson, and the love and affection of the family. The idealization of maternal love cultivates the spirit of loving the hometown, loving the country, and universal love.</p>
<p>Instinctive love, such as romantic love and maternal love, as long as it is pure, cannot be swayed by interests, reputation, status, etc. However, the romantic love of people in general now is often mixed with the above-mentioned ingredients, and playful love is not uncommon. Therefore, we really cannot agree with the above-mentioned cult of romantic love.</p>
<p>(4) Romantic Love and Marriage</p>
<p>It is very natural for people who love each other to want to be close to each other and live together forever. Therefore, romantic love and marriage are the greatest happiness of mankind. However, the highest point of romantic love is before marriage, and cracks often occur in romantic love after marriage. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Because the keynote of romantic love is the instinctive attraction of the opposite sex, and other aspects are accompanied by psychological and emotional problems. Therefore, if pure love is lacking, all kinds of cracks will occur in the emotions after sexual desire dissipates.</p>
<p>The union between husband and wife must be due to pure and innocent love.</p>
<p>(5) Creation of Marital Love</p>
<p>Since husband and wife are combined because of pure love, they must strictly abide by the monogamous system. However, some people say that pure love is indeed an ideal thing, but humans may not all be able to walk the path of idealism. Moreover, from the perspective of sexual desire, men's sexual desire often has a tendency to shift, from A to B, from B to C. In terms of this tendency, the monogamous system is unnatural.</p>
<p>But this argument is wrong. The dignity of mankind lies in having the spirit to restrain the unrestrained nature of instinct. If mankind is left to its own devices, what is the difference between it and other animals?</p>
<p>Therefore, husband and wife must maintain a monogamous system and constantly create pure love for each other.</p>
<h3>Stain Removal Methods</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wu</p>
<p>(1) Blue Ink Stains First wash with a warm solution of sodium carbonate (one to fifty), then soak in a warm solution of tartaric acid (one to fifty) for a few minutes, and then wash with clean water. The stain will disappear.</p>
<p>(2) Sweat Stains These can be removed by washing with a dilute solution of ammonia water (one to one thousand).</p>
<p>(3) Fruit Juice and Wine Stains First wash with borax water (one to two hundred), and then wash with clean water.</p>
<p>(4) Soy Sauce Stains Wash away immediately with soapy water before it dries. If it has been a day or longer, you can first apply a solution of potassium permanganate and then wash it off with clean water.</p>
<p>(5) Acid Stains You can use a dilute solution of ammonia to apply to the stain, neutralize the acidity, and then wash it off with clean water.</p>
<h3>A Model Children's Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Sincerely</p>
<p>Newspapers are the spiritual food of the people, tools for educating the public, and vanguards for transforming society. The same is true of children's newspapers. They not only increase children's knowledge, train their minds, and guide them forward, but also inspire their thinking, encourage their aspirations, and even lay the foundation for their future character. Therefore, the relationship and influence of children's newspapers on children are even greater than the relationship and influence of larger newspapers on adults.</p>
<p>Since children's newspapers bear such a significant mission and have such remarkable effects, how should those who run children's newspapers collect manuscripts, organize, edit, arrange, print, so that it becomes a model children's newspaper?</p>
<p>To date, there is no decent children's newspaper in China. However, according to the results of research and discussion among several friends who care about children's newspapers, several identical rules have been produced. Now they are disclosed here for the reference of colleagues in the education field and for joint research:</p>
<p>Format: The format is like a newspaper, making it easy to read. The area does not exceed quarto size, making it easy to fold and unfold. The layout is not rigid, and it is divided into four pages or ten columns according to the nature, so that the mood is lively and systematic. Using No. 5 lead type makes the characters large and pleasing to the eye. The space between the two lines is slightly empty, so that they are not crowded together, creating a sense of fear. Use more head flowers and small pictures to increase the attraction of the articles. The paper must be clean and white, and the ink must be thick and obvious, so as not to harm eyesight. The newspaper header is simple and generous with color printing to enhance children's love of newspapers and collect more effects.</p>
<p>Content: Current events 12%, children's news 4%, guidance 5%, children's services 2%, riddles 2%, poetry 3%, jokes 3%, stories 8%, pictures 10%, intelligence tests 3%, travelogues 5%, scripts 4%, scientific knowledge 8%, biographies of celebrities 5%, selected texts 4%, manual labor 3%, games 3%, local descriptions 4%, historical facts of the War of Resistance 4%, children's creations 8%. (This proportion is applicable within three years)</p>
<p>Writing: The articles should be short, concise, simple and clear, with more facts and less empty talk and theory. The sentences should not be verbose and lengthy, and the words should be popular, with strokes that are not complex but not unfamiliar, so that children can read without much difficulty. News about current events should be described in a child's tone, but there must be absolutely no misspellings, typos, omissions, or ungrammatical errors.</p>
<p>Judging from the current economic situation in China, the affordability of parents and children, and the amount of children's need for children's newspapers, such children's newspapers will definitely be welcomed by elementary school children in grades 4 to 6, and they can also be of practical benefit to them.</p>

<h3>How to Use a Thermometer</h3>
<p>— Deling</p>
<p>In modern families, in addition to the daily necessities such as medicines: absorbent cotton, gauze, mercurochrome, etc., a thermometer for checking body temperature—referred to as a thermometer—is indispensable. It can tell the temperature of the human body, whether the body is healthy and normal. Although you can also touch the temples or palms of your hands to measure whether the human body has fever or cold, this is unreliable, because sometimes your hands have just come out of hot or cold water, either hot or cold, and are not as accurate as a thermometer. The normal body temperature of a healthy person, regardless of gender, age, or size, is certain, usually between 36 degrees-37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). There is a slight change during the day, slightly lower at night and slightly higher during the day, but the difference is less than one degree. If the body temperature is below 36 degrees or above 37 degrees, it is a sign of illness.</p>
<p>In addition to the type used in the mouth, there is also a type used in the anus for thermometers, which is suitable for children. The function of measuring body temperature is the same. On weekdays, you can often check your body temperature to know whether the human body is healthy or not. When sick, check once every three hours, record it, and use it for the doctor's reference to understand the changes in the disease, so that the doctor can prescribe the right medicine and recover as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If unfortunately a member of the family gets sick, you can infer which disease he has from his body temperature record. If the fever does not subside for three or four days and is often around 38 degrees Celsius, it belongs to the typhoid fever category. If the body temperature is as high as 39 degrees Celsius, there is little fluctuation, and the nostrils flicker, it belongs to pneumonia and other diseases... The patient's body temperature is checked every three hours. After three checks, if it is normal at 37 degrees Celsius, there is generally no major problem, and the illness will soon recover. Pay attention to diet and there is no need to bother with medical treatment anymore. However, after each use of the thermometer, it should be wiped with alcohol-soaked cotton to disinfect it to prevent the spread of germs.</p>
<h3>Family Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Wenzhi</p>
<p>We want to make the family happier, so that every member of the family can reduce psychological pain and increase mental activity due to happiness, so as to make the body healthy. Only entertainment can achieve this purpose. However, in Chinese society, most of the common forms of entertainment are improper, and most of the entertainment of people in Europe and the United States is too noble and not allowed by our environment; therefore, we adopt a compromise method, regardless of Chinese or Western, and write down the proper and achievable ones below:</p>
<p>1.  Calligraphy and painting: Spend some spare time every day writing and painting, or appreciating famous Chinese and foreign calligraphy and paintings, which is indeed the most noble entertainment.</p>
<p>2.  Music: Music can clear people's minds. For example, , flute, erhu, harmonica, harmonium, accordion, etc., choose one to learn according to your preferences.</p>
<p>3.  Singing: Learn Chinese and Western singing, choose according to your preferences. Once you get started, the fun is endless.</p>
<p>4.  Chess: There are many kinds of chess. Play a game of your favorite every day, which will be beneficial to your body and mind, but don't waste too much time.</p>
<p>5.  Stamp collecting: Collecting Chinese and foreign stamps, classifying them and pasting them in a book is also a kind of family entertainment.</p>
<p>6.  Photography: When traveling, prepare a camera to capture ancient sites, portraits, landscapes, etc., which is also a pleasure.</p>
<p>7.  Antiques: All ancient objects can be called antiques, and scholars and elegant people like to collect them.</p>
<p>8.  Gatherings: The whole family, or invited friends, can talk, laugh, and tell stories, which can all be refreshing.</p>
<p>9.  Reading: Reading morning and evening newspapers, new and old novels, or biographies of celebrities, reading for a while every day, there is really unexpected fun.</p>
<p>10. Watching dramas: Shanghai has all kinds of theaters, and we can spend a little money to appreciate them, which can always increase our knowledge.</p>
<p>11. Ice skating: Ice skating has been popular on the sea recently. The way to play is not difficult, the cost is not much, and it is also very beneficial to the body.</p>
<p>12. Ball games: It is advisable to choose ball games that are not intense, such as net ball, billiards, badminton, golf, etc., which are all very suitable.</p>
<p>13. Chinese martial arts: Chinese martial arts are China's inherent technology, and can be practiced indoors, in open spaces, or in parks.</p>
<p>14. Gardening: It is best to have a garden at home. If not, you can put some potted flowers on the balcony or desk to decorate it.</p>
<p>15. Birds and animals: Raising cats, dogs, black carp, rabbits, and geese to play with is also a good way to pass the time.</p>
<p>16. Horse riding: Spend some money to rent a horse and gallop in the suburbs is also very good.</p>
<p>17. Driving: Drive a bicycle, motorcycle, or car and take a breeze on the road at sunset, which is also good.</p>
<p>18. Hiking: Hiking is indeed the happiest thing in life. If you don't have many days off, you might as well visit several nearby public countries.</p>
<p>19. Dancing: Although dancing in Shanghai is not a proper form of entertainment, if you are not addicted to it, it is not unpractical for couples to act on the scene occasionally.</p>
<p>20. Radio: Turn on the radio or listen to the phonograph, but it is advisable to choose noble ones to listen to, which is not necessarily a beneficial pastime.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Monk Shitao</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The tip of the brush knows no Chan master,</p>
<p>The silent illumination approaches nature.</p>
<p>I only feel the moist vitality dripping,</p>
<p>I don't know if it's ink or cloud and mist?</p>
<p>The author Ju Chao, who is known as one of the four great painting monks of the early Qing Dynasty, the author of "Tonight's Inscription on a Painting Quatrain," used such a poem to praise this unparalleled talented artist, and put this poem at the very beginning. We can know the author's utmost admiration, and even shook the supreme position of the four Wang Wu Yun, which we have to admire Ju Chao's unique insights.</p>
<p>Although Shitao's paintings can be included in a system of the Southern School, they are completely different from the style of the four Wang Wu Yun at that time. Shitao created unrestrainedly, while the six masters of the early Qing Dynasty simply regulated the Song and Yuan dynasties and inherited traditional techniques in a regular manner. Wang Taichang and his grandson also admitted that they were not as good as him. Yan Ke said: "South of the Yangtze River, no one can surpass Master Shi on the right." Lu said: "South of the Yangtze River, Shitao should be ranked first. I and Shigu are not as good as him."</p>
<p>What is his art like? Zhang Pushan's "Continued Records of Paintings" said: ""He also paints landscapes, orchids and bamboos, with unrestrained brushstrokes, shedding the clichés of painters. Duke Wu Wensu said: Master Shi's paintings look down on ancient and modern times, and the rules are overflowing."</p>
<p>"Records of the Yangzhou Painting Academy" said: He is skilled in landscapes, flowers and plants, and can wield them at will, with clouds and air bursting out.</p>
<p>Qin Zuyong's "Discussion on Painting in the Shade of Tung Trees" praised him as a "divine product," commenting: "The old man Qingxiang Daoji has unrestrained brushstrokes, shedding the clichés of painters, and is comparable to Master Shixi. Shixi is calm and happy, winning with strictness, while Shitao is unrestrained and unrestrained, winning with boldness." He also said: Landscapes become a school of their own, with elegant brushstrokes and extraordinary ideas. Every time he makes a painting, he combines with the ancients. The depth of his skills cannot be achieved without a deep understanding of the various masters of the Tang and Yuan dynasties. Bamboos, rocks, orchids, and chrysanthemums are all extremely wonderful."</p>
<p>What kind of person was Monk Shitao? From the above books, we can find simple records of "the descendants of Chu Pan of the former Ming Dynasty" and "the descendants of the Chu Fan of the Sheng Kingdom," that is, the descendants of the Ming Dynasty. Although his birth and death dates have not been determined for a while, judging from his: "In the winter of Xinwei, Mr. Zhang Ruzuo was invited in the snow, and talented people and heroes crowded the seats for a while. The first sentence of the poem "Half a Lifetime in the North and South, Old Wind and Dust" shows that that year was the fourth year of Chongzhen (1631). He should have been in his thirties or forties, that is, a chaotic world figure born in the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty. He was unwilling to see the turmoil of his homeland and the autocratic rule of the Manchu foreign race, but he was also a weak person who was unable to resist. Escaping reality was the best way out. This is the consistent style of the Chinese petty bourgeoisie. The reason why his painting style is different from the four Wang Wu Yun is that he showed a strong non-cooperation attitude with the Manchu Qing government and expressed his revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>Shaving his hair and becoming a monk in Huangshan seems to be a thorough way to escape reality. Although his non-cooperation and revolutionary spirit are expressed in the unrestrainedness of his paintings, they are still passive. Therefore, his fatalistic thoughts and outlook on life constitute the same passive and evasive tendency in his expression of being a monk and artistic style, which is revealed in the following many poems, such as:</p>
<p>"...Heavenly immortals come to earth, truly talented and outstanding, my lord's heart is able to surpass the group, you regard wealth as floating clouds, playing in the air and selling tombs. He loves guests and is willing to offer a thousand days of wine, his romantic spirit overwhelms the gates of the five marquises, fishermen from all over the world guide him together, and he returns as a long-term prince. Life is fleeting and equal, let's follow the drunken pleasure and look around..."... Previously quoted "In the winter of Xinwei, Zhang Ruzuo..."</p>
<p>"Strange peaks in the open ground are level to the top, the listening pavilion is subject to the spring breeze, white clouds are inherently ruthless objects, and they drift in my withered heart. The wind is urgent and the tide is wide, and the waves hit the head. The fishing boat is small and it is difficult to collect the interest. Please take off your black gauze hat and wait for the moon to rise on the silk wheel before reorganizing the tour." - "Inscription on a Painting".</p>
<p>"Sitting quietly under the forest, watching the clouds and listening to the water, I spend my days leisurely, enjoying a volume of green mountains." - "Inscription on a Painting".</p>
<p>Shitao saw the chaos and ugliness of reality. He thought of reforming, but he was already a monk traveling around the world, so he could only vent his anger through poetry and painting, so he wrote: "In the third month of Renwu spring, the Begonias under the Dadi Hall are enchanting, playfully writing and imitating the posthumous meaning of Huang."</p>
<p>"Thousands of flowers are dyed red, stop drinking and hate the east wind, the thin cold is still sad for the flowers, not to mention the magpies in the opening."</p>
<p>The enchantment of Begonias probably represents the reality at that time. He wanted to change, but he was very timid, and only had the courage to apply a little powder to the color. Let's look at the poem "Retitled the next day":</p>
<p>"Begonia asks Chun Gui on the school, unexpectedly the spring breeze is full of snow on the branches, it should be because of the red makeup and great enchantment, so apply a little powder to put on rouge."</p>
<p>Renwu was the fifteenth year of Chongzhen (1642), which was when the Ming Dynasty was about to perish. The world was in chaos, so of course he would have such resentment.</p>
<p>Shitao lived an isolated life in contradictory thinking, and he never wanted to find an accurate way out, but this way out was only developed intricately in his painting theory. Here, the poem "Title Spring River Picture" is used as proof:</p>
<p>"Calligraphy and painting are not small things, the world only looks at the form, the pen is chaotic, and intelligence dies when entering clumsiness, the principle is exhausted and the law is endless, and the law is exhausted and the principle is born, the principle and law have no transmission, and the ancients have no choice. ..."</p>
<p>In this poem, "principle" and "law" only become dialectical development, but when "principle" is born, there is no courage to make it develop further, and finally it stagnates in the category of fatalism.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone believes that "Bitter Gourd Monk's Painting Quotations" "The words and meanings are mysterious, and they all come from the classics." It is doubtful. Because the "One Painting Chapter" of "The method of one painting is to generate law from no law; and to penetrate all laws with law." is nothing more than the same tendency as described above.</p>
<h3>Shitao: Landscape</h3>
<p>(Collection of Dafengtang)</p>
<h3>Pond</h3>
<p>— Chen Ji</p>
<p>In this remote and barren countryside, there are no rushing rivers; there are only many lovely small ponds.</p>
<p>Standing on the top of a high mountain, looking at this green countryside, the shining ponds are like a handful of stars scattered in the night sky. It's also like someone's eyes in our memory...</p>
<p>The pond is silent, like a philosopher; the pond water is clear, like a philosopher's state of mind. How many changes in the wind and clouds in the sky are seen in his eyes; how many times of washing away the snow and suffering, freezing his body. But the pool is still silent——</p>
<p>So, some people say that the soul of the pool is stiff. The emotion is numb!</p>
<p>But when the warm days come, the pond grows lush reeds around it, emerald-like duckweed; and purple small flowers, white small flowers, golden small flowers, and tender red small flowers swaying on the water. Lively dragonflies and butterflies fly in groups. At night, fireflies carry small lanterns and sit on the tips of the industry, in twos and threes, listening to frogs singing folk songs.</p>
<p>These are the lives that the pond nurtures, the eastern garden that the pond creates, and the flowers and plants are so prosperous! However, the pool is silent, still like a philosopher.</p>
<p>Often some women come to the pool to wash clothes, shepherds come to wash the dirt on their feet, and people take the water from the pool, no, the blood from the pool, to wash themselves clean, but the pool water is made so dirty and turbid! The pool is still silent, and in the silence, it settles the dirty things down, and gradually the pool becomes clean and bright again.</p>
<p>When the drought came, the sun was burning green fire in the fields, the soil was cracking and the rice was weakly falling down, everyone was squeezing against each other, groaning slightly in the hot wind. So the farmers put the mouth of the waterwheel into the pool; only saw a waterwheel on the east side and a waterwheel on the west side, only heard the waterwheel squealing, and the pool water was silent.</p>
<p>The next day, the blood of the pond flowed in the veins of the fields, the soil was moistened, and the rice stood upright in the morning light. But the pool dried up, and the flowers and plants in the east also withered!</p>
<p>Now, this pond, which sacrificed itself and used its blood to save people, has died silently!</p>
<p>Standing on the top of a high mountain, looking at this green countryside, those small ponds are like the lost eyes of someone after death in our memory... We think of his life.</p>
<h3>The Life of a Musician</h3>
<p>— Jiahui</p>
<p>Mozart (Wolfgang Amadeus Moazart) was extremely poor. He had no money to buy firewood to warm his simple house. He could only wrap his hands in wool socks to keep warm, and then create sacred music, making his name immortal.</p>
<p>At the age of thirty-five, he died of tuberculosis. His vitality was depleted due to constant hunger, cold, and lack of nutrition.</p>
<p>His poor funeral really only cost three yuan and ten cents. The cheap pine coffin was only followed by six people—even they dispersed due to the rain.</p>
<h3>Lady Wei's "Diagram of Brush Formation"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shushan</p>
<p>Lady Wei of the Jin Dynasty was good at official script and regular script. She was the teacher of Wang Yishao (Xizhi) of the Right Army and also made "Diagram of Brush Formation" which has been passed down to later generations. It can be seen that Lady Wei was good at writing, just like the great writers of the Han Dynasty were good at writing. Lady's name was Shuo, courtesy name Mao Yi, and she was the daughter of Li Ju, the prefect of Ruyin. Therefore, she was also called Lady Li. Her father, Wei , and her brother, Wei Heng, were both good at cursive script and official script. It can be said that her family had a profound academic background.</p>
<p>But Lady's teacher was , and there is a letter from her to her teacher in the post. It also mentioned her disciple Wang Youjun. Her book says: "Recently, I was ordered to write "Rapid Success Chapter", so I could not write to my teacher. But Wei has learned from the world and imitated , so it has been many years. At the age of twenty, I wrote a poem and discussed the general solution of cursive script, but I did not dare to present it. Wei has a disciple named Wang Yishao, who is very able to learn Wei's regular script. He is aggressive, his brushstrokes are exquisite, and his calligraphy is . The teacher can go to the Jin Shang Library to write books. I rely on your high judgment, which is beyond words." Zhang Huai瓘 of the Tang Dynasty said in "Book Breaking": "Lady Wei's official script is especially good at rules. Zhong Gong said: It is like broken jade in a pot of ice, the moon on the Yao Terrace, gentle and fragrant trees, and gentle like a clear wind."</p>
<p>The "Diagram of Brush Formation" made by Lady Wei is to explain the method of writing characters, but Sun Guoting of the Tang Dynasty said in "Book Spectrum"; "The Diagram of Brush Formation has been circulated in the north and south, and it is suspected that it was made by Youjun. Although the truth is not known, it can still enlighten children." Wang Youjun served Lady Wei as his teacher and once wrote "After the Inscription on the Diagram of Brush Formation," which may have led to Sun Guoting's suspicion.</p>
<p>According to Lady's note after the "Diagram of Brush Formation Record," she made it in the fourth year of Yonghe (348 AD), which is nearly 1,600 years ago. The first sentence of this record says: "The mystery of the three ends is none other than using the brush; the mystery of the six arts is none other than the silver hook. In the past, Prime Minister Si of Qin saw the book of King Mu of Zhou, and sighed for seven days, worried that it had no bones; Shangshu Cai entered Hongdu and watched the code, and did not return for ten weeks, lamenting its excellence; therefore, those who know its source are few, and those who are concerned about its principles are many. Since modern times, they have not learned from the ancients, but have abandoned the Tao because of their emotions. They only remember their names, or their learning is not comprehensive, and their knowledge is limited, so that they cannot achieve success and waste their energy in vain. If they are not spiritually enlightened, they cannot be talked about this Tao."</p>
<p>Before this, it also said: "The brush should be made of rabbit hair from the steep cliffs of high mountains, collected in August or September. The brush head should be one inch long, and the shaft should be five inches long. The inkstone should be made of newly mined stone that is dry and smooth, with floating saliva and black ink. The ink should be made of pine soot from Mount Lu and deer glue from Dai County, which is stronger than stone after ten years. The paper should be made of fish roe from Dongyang, which is soft, smooth, and clean. When learning to write characters, first learn to hold the brush. If it is regular script, hold it two inches and one minute from the brush head. If it is cursive script, hold it three inches and one minute from the brush head. When writing, painting waves and curves, you must use all your strength to send it. If you are a beginner, write big characters first, not small ones. Those who are good at appraisal do not write, and those who are good at writing do not appraise. Those who are good at brush strength have more bones, and those who are not good at brush strength have more flesh. Those who have more bones and less flesh are called tendon script, and those who have more flesh and less bones are called ink pig. Those who have more strength and tendons are saints, and those who have no strength and no plate are sick. One or two follow their news and use them." After the picture, it also says: "There are seven ways to hold the brush: some are anxious and hold the brush slowly, and some are slow and hold the brush quickly; if the grip is close but not tight, the heart and hand are not in sync, and the meaning is behind the pen, which leads to failure; if the grip is far and fast, the meaning is ahead of the pen, which leads to victory. There are also six ways to use the brush: the structure is round and complete like seal script, fluttering and scattered like Zhang Cao, fierce and terrifying like eight points, graceful and elegant like flying white, upright and independent like a crane's head, and luxuriant and unrestrained like ancient official script. However, the heart is twisted and each character is made, each resembling its shape, which is ingenious and the way of calligraphy is complete."</p>
<p>As for her disciple Wang Youjun, he said in the inscription: "Paper is the formation, brush is the knife, ink is the helmet, inkstone is the city, heart and mind are the general, skill is the deputy general, structure is the strategy, Yangbi is good and bad, entry and exit are orders, and twists are killing." This is the explanation for why it is called "Diagram of Brush Formation." As for those who doubt that this was not written by Lady Wei, it is nothing more than a kind of traditional prejudice, which need not be repeated.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 28</p>
<p>I introduced myself again, supplementing Little Tiger's meager vocabulary, and introduced Yaoqun and Mr. W as well, of course, adding a few extraordinary words about Little Tiger. At the same time, I had to explain to Yaoqun the "why" of this visit, which was because Tsurumi had said that it was a place where we could talk—because the location had been arranged by him.</p>
<p>"You probably already know why we're so late," I said to Yaoqun, glancing at Little Tiger at the same time. He nodded cleverly with his big round eyes, indicating that he had told Yaoqun everything that had happened on the way. "The reason we had to trouble Mr. W to come here in person is partly because of Gu Jun's idea, partly because of Mr. W's idea, and partly, perhaps more importantly, because of your ambition, knowledge, and ideas, all of which are superior to others..."</p>
<p>"I dare not," he interrupted me crisply, not letting me ramble on. "Both of you are elder statesmen. If you put it that way, we can only feel ashamed as mere children. Gu Jun explained many things in his letter. Tiger and I are now prepared to receive instruction, training, cultivation, and orders." His voice was gentle but with a hint of strength. "Tiger" of course, refers to Little Tiger.</p>
<p>"You're too kind, too kind." Mr. W opened his mouth with a smile; then, he paused and put away his smile; "Mr. Yue just mentioned that we are here partly because of my own intentions; that's right, it was my request to Gu Jun. Because of our bureau's rules, whether someone volunteers or is introduced, anyone who joins our bureau must go through three steps: first, an investigation of the participant; second, testing—of work ability—those with special abilities are of course directly appointed, otherwise they must undergo some considerable training; third, formal appointment..."</p>
<p>"Regarding points one and two, with Gu Jun's introduction and explanation, we don't need to bother with them. So, I came here partly to express our sincerity in seeking talent; in addition, I also want to fulfill the formalities stipulated by our bureau. In any case, before formally joining, we must have a conversation—at a suitable location outside any office of this bureau..."</p>
<p>Assuming you are a writer, or a news agency reporter, or a special correspondent for a newspaper, assuming you have been introduced to Mr. W or an important figure in the Military Intelligence Bureau's counter-espionage organization for an interview, I think, no matter how talented or capable you are, this dedicated visit of yours is bound to fail, or at least be a waste of effort.</p>
<p>You may be able to get some "material" through careful thought and indirect questioning, which is the price of your efforts, but the moment you leave, you are bound to hear a sentence: "Because we are still 'continuing to work,' please do not publish what we just talked about"!</p>
<p>Okay, you admit that you are somewhat disappointed with this trip (if you are not willing to admit failure immediately.) On the way back to the hotel (newspaper office), or on the way home, you must be thinking, "At least I can circle around his residence, his demeanor, his something-something, and add a few of my own feelings, can't I still say it's an interview?"</p>

<h3>Vigilance</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday, September 9th, I attended the surrender ceremony of the China Theater held at the Central Military Academy (formerly the Army Headquarters) on Huangpu Road in Nanjing. As a news reporter, I witnessed this historical scene that ended eight years of bloody war.</p>
<p>The layout of the entire venue was overseen by engineering expert General Ma Chongliu, and it was solemn and dignified. The atmosphere that permeated every participant and the inside and outside of the venue was beyond my ability to describe the mixed emotions of sorrow and joy. Everyone's heart was heavy, a little dazed, and a little joyous, but eight years of time, millions of lives, vast territories, and the construction of the future were all flashing in their minds, and everyone became solemn!</p>
<p>The two protagonists of this historical drama were indeed the most distinct contrast, the most appropriate illustration: General He Yingqin, with his graceful demeanor, gentle and refined manner, and amiable demeanor; Okamura Yasutsugu, gloomy and composed, like a wounded beast, superficially submissive, but with a bellyful of stubbornness and unwillingness. To be honest, from the ceremony's beginning at nine o'clock in the morning until fifty-two minutes later, I focused all my energy on observing the actions of these two protagonists.</p>
<p>I only have one thought, a thought that I clearly remember today, a year later, and will always remember, and I am willing to offer it here for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>That thought is: the Japanese nation is not to be underestimated. Although they have now been defeated and surrendered, they are by no means convinced. They are determined to rise again, and they have the confidence to do so. Although we now clearly reside in a victorious country, if we do not put in painstaking efforts in the next ten years, there will never be peace, and we will sink into an irrecoverable abyss.</p>
<p>When celebrating victory, we should understand this point more deeply!</p>
<h3>Talking About Cheating on Exams</h3>
<p>— Ling Ren</p>
<p>The trend of students cheating on exams has been prevalent in Shanghai since it became an isolated island. Recently, it can be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>Moreover, the methods of cheating are carried out on a large scale, almost a collective action. There is organization, there are institutions, and the methods are extremely "clever." Teachers cannot ban it, cannot catch it, and some simply have no ability to ban it at all, and can only turn a blind eye, hoping that the cheating students will leave a little leeway, "bestow" some face, or not be too rampant.</p>
<p>However, they have reasons, half-true and half-false reasons:</p>
<p>"What can we do? If we don't cheat and our grades are failing, we have to repeat a grade, we have to take remedial classes, where does the money come from?"</p>
<p>"If the exam does not reach the required level, then how can the scholarship for the next semester be approved?" This is the "righteous cause" of cheating.</p>
<p>"What can we do? If I don't cheat, others cheat, and they score better than me."</p>
<p>Oh my God!</p>
<p>Please, education experts, pay attention to these things! Do not think that students with good grades are necessarily more capable. Grades, these false things, are corrupting the students!</p>
<h3>Died So Wonderfully</h3>
<p>— Ying Ying</p>
<p>A certain private middle school in this city usually teaches quite strictly. If a graduating student fails one subject, a diploma will not be issued until the student passes a makeup exam. A year ago, the old principal of the school passed away, and soon a new principal was born, along with a new director of education. The old director of education had no choice but to retire. Before leaving, unwilling in his heart, he issued all the diplomas of the graduating students who had failed the exam. The students all raised their hands to their foreheads and said that the old principal died so wonderfully.</p>
<h3>Auction Stories – The Myth of Reality</h3>
<p>— Zhong Shi</p>
<p>China is the most magical ancient country, and summer nights are the most suitable for myths. Therefore, in the past few days, under melon sheds and bean trellises, after tea and wine, friends have been idly recounting many incredible stories—or, more accurately, true stories that are stranger than stories.</p>
<p>A small businessman named Mao bought five wooden boxes of glass tubes and other miscellaneous items in a public auction from a wharf warehouse in Yangshupu for 1.8 million yuan. After a few days, he resold them to a machine factory owner and earned 8 million yuan. Unexpectedly, the old owner was a discerning person who unpacked and inspected them and knew that they were valuable chemical factory instruments. Coincidentally, a foreign factory urgently needed them recently and agreed to a price of 300 million yuan. What about the boss? He's not that stupid! He bargained for 500 million yuan.</p>
<p>On another occasion, a used goods dealer obtained 18 boxes of water-damaged goods in an auction for 1.11 million yuan. Upon opening the boxes, he found that they were actually bristles, worth more than 80 million yuan. There was also a Mr. Xu, an iron merchant, who was a friend of a friend. He was also visited by the god of wealth. One day, he wandered around the auction site with several colleagues and bought a few barrels of oil for more than 800,000 yuan. His colleagues opened them and found water, but he was lucky enough to open the barrels and get tung oil, thus inexplicably and effortlessly earning more than 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>China originally had many folk legends such as "Jiangxi people know treasures," but unexpectedly, the real "knowing treasures and getting rich" would happen today. The auction organization lost a fortune in vain, but a few merchants got rich. I don't know if this is their fortune or the misfortune of the country?</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>
<p>— San Gong</p>
<p>"When Will the Takeover and Investigation Team Return?"</p>
<p>One of the slogans for the September 9th Sports Festival is "Education First, Sports First." This reminds us of the great mission of the "sun-drying platform exercise fields" in some elementary schools today!</p>
<p>Lawyers from the enemy-puppet period have now been allowed to resume appearing in court. This should be a target for suspected traitors to hire defense lawyers, because only these lawyers are the most "understanding" people.</p>
<p>From a sports perspective, some people consider horse racing "normal entertainment," and it also has an income of 300 million to 500 million yuan per month. In addition, the municipal conference has already approved it, so some people speculate that the resumption of horse racing is almost a certainty. Those who are enthusiastic about champagne tickets, why not come?</p>
<p>Chinese people have a "mouth that is good at lecturing," and Americans have "hands that are good at implementing." Therefore, China's export goods have only been preparing for an exhibition for a few months, while American import goods have silently overthrown the five-thousand-year-old history of sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and soybean milk.</p>
<p>The investigation team has gone to Hangzhou. Before leaving, they told reporters: "Less than one-tenth of the cases have been handled in Shanghai." Then what about the remaining nine-tenths? One cannot help but miss "When Will You Return"?</p>
<h3>Request to Mr. Rong Desheng</h3>
<p>— Ren Ziguang</p>
<p>Using one-seventh of the Redemption Money to Restore Four Schools in His Hometown</p>
<p>Now the Rong case has become a thing of the past, and the government has returned the 250,000 US dollars in redemption money. According to reports, Mr. Rong intends to use a portion of the money to reward the military police who solved the case, and the remainder will be used for good deeds. However, how to allocate the money is still awaiting Mr. Rong's approval. Will it be used for refugee relief or for education? I believe that refugee relief is certainly important, but education is even more important. Therefore, we absolutely sympathize with Mr. Shao Fu's proposal to establish the "Desheng Scholarship."</p>
<p>However, I have another suggestion for Mr. Rong. Because Mr. Rong has always been very enthusiastic about education, he founded four elementary schools and one middle school near his hometown (Rongxiang, Wuxi) thirty years ago. Over the years, he has cultivated countless talents. In recent years, talents in the industrial and commercial circles have emerged in his hometown, which cannot be said to be unrelated to this. During the Anti-Japanese War, local bandits ran rampant, so these schools were disassociated from the Rong family and barely maintained in a semi-open and semi-closed corrupt state. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, Mr. Ying may be busy restoring his business, so the four elementary schools, except for one middle school, have not yet been taken over. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mr. Rong to set aside one-seventh of the redemption money, totaling 100 million yuan, to restore the four schools. Setting aside 100 million yuan to purchase school property, based on the price of land in Wuxi, can buy 80 mu of land, 20 mu per school, which is enough to maintain them permanently.</p>
<p>I venture to make a plea for my hometown and ask Mr. Rong to resolutely promote education to restore the four schools in my hometown before the war, and then use most of the money to establish the "Desheng Student Loan." If so, it will definitely have infinite value for society and the nation.</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>Du Yuming, Who Fought Bravely in the North and South</h3>
<p>— Younan</p>
<p>—The First Commander of the National Army's Mechanized Division—</p>
<p>In 1924, "the cradle of the Chinese Army," the Whampoa Military Academy held its first graduation ceremony. In a long list of graduates, one line read: Du Yuming, from Shanxi, currently 21 years old. It was not until more than a decade later that this name shone in China.</p>
<p>Rich Emotion</p>
<p>He has a burly figure and strong physical strength, but he is full of emotion. Whenever he is troubled by sorrow and pain and cannot vent it, he often sheds a few "heroic tears."</p>
<p>After graduating, he joined the army as a platoon leader and was promoted to company, battalion, and regimental commander for his military exploits. In 1937, he led the tank regiment to participate in the Battle of Shanghai, fighting in the north and south, and was promoted from brigade commander to chief of staff. In 1939, the Chinese Army established its first mechanized unit—the 200th Division—and Du was appointed as its commander. In the winter of 1939, he was promoted to commander of the Fifth Army and participated in the Battle of Southern Guangxi and Kunlungan Pass; our army's shift from defensive to offensive against the Japanese invaders began with Du's unit. In 1942, he led his troops on an expedition to Burma and then to India. Midway, it was the rainy season, with poisonous miasma. After experiencing all kinds of hardships, he returned to China, crossing mountains and ridges on foot for three months. Although Du was physically strong, he felt overwhelmed. Upon reaching Kunming, he fell ill.</p>
<p>Wounded in Western Yunnan</p>
<p>In the spring of 1945, Du was wounded in the leg during the Western Yunnan Campaign. He did not recover until before the Japanese surrender. In September, he was ordered to go to the Northeast. In January of this year, Du personally drove a jeep to inspect the Chexin. The wind and snow outside the Great Wall were bitterly cold, so he felt uncomfortable and his right leg ached. After a doctor's diagnosis, it was believed to be kidney inflammation. On February 18, he was sent to the Peking Central Hospital for treatment. On March 12, he underwent surgery to remove the left kidney and was discharged from the hospital on the 28th. After two months of recuperation, he returned to his defense area.</p>
<p>Du is knowledgeable and speaks frankly. Every word has the power to move people. He is already 43 years old this year, but he looks very young. Writing this, I wish this model soldier of the new China good health!</p>
