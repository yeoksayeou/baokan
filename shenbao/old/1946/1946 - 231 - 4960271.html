<h3>宋院長發表書面聲明　外匯匯率重行調整　盼全國合作穩定物價　彭部長昨在招待記者席上宣布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央宣傳部長彭學沛，昨午後六時在上海市政府會議室招待中外各報記者，宣布中央銀行已奉准調整外滙滙率，將於今（十九日）晨十時變更掛牌。彭部長首稱：宋院長因公未能親來，繼即宣讀宋院長所發表之書面聲明，其全文如次：</p>
<p>今日中央銀行奉准調整外滙滙率，政府並於本月十七日，決定取銷出口稅，其目的在求輸出入貿易之趨於平衡，及生產事業之活潑發展，今後且將繼續運用黃金準備，以穩定國內幣值，今國幣對外購買力，既已超出國內之幣值，故此次外滙率之變動，可使國內外幣值，得到合理的調和，所望全國人士，共喻此旨，尤盼全國生產事業，特別以民生主要物品爲對象者，悉能體會政府施政之意義，爲整個國計民生所關，乃至整個生產前途安危所緊，一致能力合作，務使物價由此益臻於穩定。</p>
<p>追溯有關因素</p>
<p>此次政府，在決定辦法以前，經將各種有關經濟問題，加以詳盡的檢討，對於實施時間，尤曾鄭重考慮，茲將與本問題有關之重要因素，追溯原委，簡括說明：</p>
<p>吾國在抗戰期間，物資之直接損失，固已慘重，而工廠及一切生產設備，大量毀壞，以致生產能力，大爲低落，加以對外貿易，萬分困難，輸入物品，幾瀕絕境，迨勝利獲到之時，國內物資，已見極度短絀，故當時最急迫之需要，爲大量物資之補充，而最有效及最迅速之補充方法，無疑的爲鼓勵國外物資之輸入。</p>
<p>推行平行政策</p>
<p>本年三月初施行之管理外滙暫行辦法，對於預期的效果，收穫頗宏，已往五個月內，輸入物資，數量既見增加，價格亦逐步低降，惟若干輸入品之利潤，仍屬過鉅，而又有若干輸入品，與國貨競銷，其影響於本國工業至大，至於輸出業，則迄未能滿意進展，輸出所得之外滙，遠不及輸入方面之數量，同時凡可以供應國外市塲之農工生產品，又因生產成本太大，極難競爭於國際市塲，已處於不利之地位，而出口稅之繼續征收，復加重輸出貿易之担負，以上種種，均有待於革新之舉措，以解決當前遭遇之困難，至改革辦法，付諸實施之時機，則以現在爲最適宜，一則豐收在望，糧價已漸趨跌落，一則出口季節，將入經常旺盛階段，實施以後，應得到下列幾種良好結果：（一）鼓勵輸出，減少輸入；（二）激導僑民匯款回國；（三）扶助國內生產事業。凡此均可助成輸出入之趨於平衡，但政府除此項舉措外，並努力推行其他平行政策，在交通方面，則以全力恢復路航幹綫，並於財政可能範圍內，儘量拓展對於全國工商重心，如上海等地之港務整理及調度，將設置強有力之管理機構，以減輕裝卸貨物之費用，並採取一切必要步驟，以促進貿易之暢流，在敵僞產業之處理方面，擬儘量移讓民營，政府絕對無意採用普遍國營制度，至規模較大之生產單位，如中紡公司，所需資本甚大，一時招商接辦，無從實現，故暫歸政府整理經營，但短期內當可將股權作有計劃之移讓，國庫藉可得適當之取償，至資本市塲方面，現正積極籌劃，恢復上海證劵交易所，以疏導游資，並使國營事業需要移讓時得有靈活之途徑，敵僞其他物資及設備，刻正分頭配售，以增加供應，補益庫收，至於經常稅賦收入，亦正切實整理，每月遞增，惟戰後復員，因方面繁多，其臨時支出至爲浩大，其應付方針，自應將非最急要之支出，暫緩辦理，在此復員過渡期間，各方面所感受之痛苦，固所不免，政府決以所有力量，努力於平衡預算，穩定物價，及安定民生，總之，最後目標，爲求全國人民安居樂業，社會經濟日趨繁榮，藉以保持吾國在國際應有之地位。</p>
<h3>中央銀行今日掛牌　市長召重要會議　籲請各業勿藉詞漲價</h3>
<p>彭氏宣讀宋院長聲明後，由國際宣傳處專員魏景蒙氏譯爲英語譯畢，彭氏繼起聲稱關於外匯匯率，中央銀行定於明日（即十九日）上午十時正式掛牌，上午九時由呉市長召集本市各業公會理事長及常務理事等，在市政府大禮堂舉行重要會議，被邀者，有市商會理事長，常務理事，豆米行業同業公會，米號業，紡織業同業公會，百貨業同業公會，油業同業公會，麫粉業同業公會，麵粉廠業同業公會，中國植物油料廠，中國紡織公司，先施公司總經理，永安公司總經理，新新公司總經理，大新公司總經理等，屆時除宣佈政府調整外匯匯率之重要方針外，並將籲請各業公會負責人，對於與外匯匯率無關之國內貨物切勿藉口匯率調整，隨之上漲，因政府此次決定取銷出口稅，調整匯率，純爲發展生產事業及出口貿易，俾改善目前經濟困難情況。至於國內一般貨物既與外匯匯率根本無關，自無隨之上漲之理由，尤其是糧食，各省普遍豐收，糧價必將漸趨下跌，關於此點，希望輿論界多多宣揚，協助政府力謀穩定物價之措施。</p>
<p>組設港務委會</p>
<p>彭部長旋復作另一項宣佈稱：「上海港埠向來擁擠，商輪在港外有等待至二三星期之久未能卸貨者，國外人士對此頗多批評。政府頃已訓令組織港務委員會，出呉國楨市長任主任委員，交通部，財政部，資源委員會，警備司令部，江海關，濬浦局及各航業公司等代表爲委員，研究如何改革港務，管制堆棧·碼頭·河道交通並疏濬黃浦等事宜，以期迅速改善港務，配合剛才所發表的措施」。</p>
<p>購越米五萬噸</p>
<p>彭部長最後並對最近國內糧食情形，有所闡明，渠稱：「今年江西，湖南，四川，江蘇，浙江等省糧食大豐收。江西因新穀業已登塲，價格大跌。江浙雖因目前尚在青黃不接之際，米價未見下落，然並不足以憂慮。蓋今船舶極多，政府正擬自川贛等地源源運來，故本市米價之回跌實僅時間問題。政府並已與法經濟代表團團長穆和商議，訂購越米五萬噸，將於今年下半年運來中國。該項米糧係由四法國公司代辦者，公司名稱爲（一）龍東，（Loddon），（二）奧利維，（Oriviel），（三）康悌諾泰，（Canti　Nintal），（四）台尼斯（Denise　Frere）。」</p>
<p>昨日招待會上，除宋院長因公未來由彭部長主持發表外，計到關務署署長張福運，中央社上海分社主任馮有真，國際宣傳處上海辦事處主任魏景蒙，市府新聞發布處處長朱虛白及中外各報記者六十餘人，六時四十分散會。</p>
<p>關務署長談話</p>
<p>（又訊）記者昨訪關務署署長張福運氏，叩詢意見，據張氏表示：政府此次按照實際情形，施行調整外匯匯率，其調整後之關稅標準，雖不能符合國內工商界之理想，然對情理上，甚爲適合目前之環境。（尚有關於變更匯率之參攷資料，請參閱第七版）</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺十八日電〕經濟部長王雲五談，工貸已得當局允許，辦法已擬定，不久即可發表。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十八日電〕王雲五，朱家驊定十九日聯袂離牯返京，十八日午王氏再謁　蔣主席，報告經濟部最近措施，事後告記者，扶植民營工商業之戰後復興，毋庸工商界請願，余爲職責及良心督促，均義不容辭，扶植之道，將先從辦理工貸及技術指導入手，詳細辦法，當可逐步實施。朱氏謂，蔣主席邀約各大學校長敎授，便道分批來牯垂詢，固有可能。</p>

<h3>我財政情形　好轉三主因</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕關係方面稱：最近我國財政情形好轉，主因有三：（一）敵僞產業清理已有頭緒，有若干區域出售順利，國庫收入增加；（二）國營事業之收入增加；（三）各項稅收亦增。在此情勢之下，故有公務員加薪之舉，查此次加薪爲主席接受立法院建議之原則而實行者，此舉將令國庫每月之開支增加一百五十億元，但因收入情形之好轉，已不必全賴於發行。</p>
<h3>陳誠總長　澈夜辦公</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕軍務倥偬聲中，陳誠總長昨在國防部澈夜辦公，未回寓邸。</p>
<h3>北戴河站美軍　又遭共軍襲擊　安平事件續聽取報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平十八日電〕美陸戰隊第一帥一部份，駐紮地北戴河之火車站，昨遭共軍襲擊。據益世報載，共軍萬人已將守衛該車站之國軍護路隊解除武裝，並包圍該區一部份國軍正規部隊，戰事入夜未已，唐山方面國軍現正馳往北戴河增援。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕調查安平事件之廿五小組，十八日仍照常工作，按照輪流主席制，十八日由政府代表張叔衡少將主席，先後詢問陸戰隊第一營長柏茲中校及身與安平之役之伍長魏根，其中以柏茲中校之報告提供新材料最多，彼稱：（一）七月廿九日巡邏隊之編組，前面有巡邏車四輛，最後有巡邏車四輛，中間被護送之運輸車十五輛，由一尉官指揮，另有上士四人，兵士三十七人，救護醫員一人，武器有點五零機槍一，點三零機槍一，分設前後兩車，另有六寸釐擲彈筒二，勃朗寗自動步槍十枝，唐姆式自動衝鋒步槍一枝，十輪步槍廿六枝，丁姆溫式點三零步槍十二枝。此項巡邏隊爲一般巡邏隊之加強者，一般巡邏隊最低僅有士兵廿五名，官長一名，此次巡邏隊除該所隸屬之　一團士兵外，尚配屬有第一團士兵。共黨代表黃逸峯指出，此種編組超出該營建制，必爲師所編組者，（二）巡邏隊之加強編組係由於七月廿八日美軍事兩次由平來津途中遭受襲擊，師部已獲報告。（三）安平東西各五英里左右區域無國軍駐紮，今爲共軍進出之地，但彼並未親見。（四）彼否認曾將戰鬥員集中於輸送隊之前部，行列後部亦有戰鬥員，丟克所云後面機槍無從操縱之說，因彼一旅客，對整個情況不瞭解。（五）在巡邏隊出發之前，彼給予之指示爲：甲，將運輸車輛護送至北平，乙，路上如遇阻碍，予以清除，如遇射擊，可加速衝過，如遇可能危及車輛物資人員之非通常射擊可予還擊。（六）運輸隊中有師部准予隨行之行　卡車一，上裝救濟物資，車上有華人四名。（七）彼對執行部之報告，係前詢問四十九人所草擬者，彼不知國軍供給美軍以情報情事。（八）巡邏隊前後各有一無綫電車，該日出發前，營部爲便於與巡邏隊遠距離聯絡，特於天津郊外安設一電台與之聯絡，該台與巡邏隊連絡至十一時五分即中斷。（九）由於路上敷有障碍物及公路三方面皆配有兵力，可知攻擊者係有計劃之行動。至十一時半詢問完畢，魏根伍長之報告內容大致相同，至下午一時始畢。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>變動外匯率以後</h3>
<p>行政院宋院長昨日發表的聲明，所包含的範圍甚廣。約略地把他分析一下，大要如左：</p>
<p>（一）決定取消出口稅；</p>
<p>（二）決定變動外滙率；</p>
<p>（三）全力恢復路航幹綫，以便利交通；</p>
<p>（四）整理港務，以減輕裝卸費用；</p>
<p>（五）敵僞產業，儘量移讓民營；</p>
<p>（六）中紡等國營事業之股權，作有計劃之移讓；</p>
<p>（七）從速恢復上海證券交易所；</p>
<p>（八）分別配售敵僞物資及設備；</p>
<p>（九）整理稅收，平衡預算。</p>
<p>（十）歸結到穩定物價，安定民生，以達到安居樂業，繁榮經濟的最大目的。</p>
<p>宋院長這次的聲明，可說對於財政，經濟各方面，無一處不加以觸及。自本年三月間開放外滙，及訂定輸出入貿易辦法以來，政府所宣佈的關於財政，經濟政策，允推昨日這篇聲明爲最重要了。</p>
<p>但自（三）·（四）·以下至（十）項，或已早經着手，或尚待設計推行，其於目前的關係，還不算十分密切；其中十分密切，立將發生反應和作用的，當莫過於（一）·（二）·兩項。</p>
<p>出口稅的廢除，在清季已經有人倡導。近世各國，除掉獨占品或若干原料品尚保留一部份的出口稅外，其以財政上的原因而普徧征收出口稅的，已是絕無僅有。此次經最高國防會議議決，把它全部廢除，在我國財政史上，確是值得大書特書的一件事。尤其是出口極度衰落，國際貸借無法平衡的今日，也是最迫切而最合理的一件事。</p>
<p>至於外匯率的變動，其數字雖尚待今日上午十時由中央銀行正式公佈，但字裏行間，其掛牌匯價無疑地將予提高，這是必然的事。究竟要提高到如何程度？這問題，雖爲一般人所深切關懷，但轉瞬即將發表，在極短的期間，我們也無須過於推敲。照政府一貫的作風，和當局對於穩定物價這一點十分注重，或者與現在的黑市價格，總應該不會相差過遠吧？</p>
<p>跟隨着匯率變動而來的最大問題，當然是物價。政府所最關切的在此；一般人所最注意的也在此。我們則以爲除掉若干投機家故意作祟而外，其實也並沒有因外匯率變動而過於激動物價的理由。其論據如次：</p>
<p>（一）黑市匯價，盤旋在二千五六百左右，爲時已久，上星期六，並曾穿出過七百大關。所以新定匯價，如果不十分超過現實的話，那麼，根本對物價並沒有絲毫激動的理由。</p>
<p>（二）已到埠的進口貨，大都還是比較便宜的時候結的　價。</p>
<p>（三）當局對於外滙這一事，態度十分鄭重。這次變更以後，在相當時期以內，我們相信斷不會再有什麼變動。</p>
<p>（四）目前洋貨充斥，有數類物價早已跌到和進本相等。</p>
<p>（五）今年秋收豐稔，物資的供應狀況，已與抗戰期間及勝利初期不同。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但我國人的投機熱和洋貨熱，向來非常旺盛，復員以後，許多新興的企業和許多老商家，以生產事業感到困難的緣故，也多從事於進口和囤積，這一類投機和囤商的活動，還得要公私各方面予以深切的注意和防制，同時積極地推行節約，提倡國貨，這方才是根本的救濟。</p>
<p>發展生產，和繁榮社會經濟，原不是一件簡單的事情。要單　某一種單純的方法來解決一切的困難，本來是一種奢望。所以除掉提高匯價之外，我們認爲有許多事，尚須分別設法，相　而行。例如：有許多目前不必要和不應要的洋貨，不妨再進一步，切實制止。我們覺得對於進口貨，應分爲四大類辦理：（一）禁止，（二）限制，（三）自由進口，和（四）獎勵進口。因為匯價雖然變動了，國內外的物價，一時還未必能平衡。試看本　的物價，比戰前已漲上四五千倍，而美國還不過三四倍。（根據黑市）現在匯價約漲上六百倍，乘以美國物價，還不過一千八百倍。這次提高的程度如何，此時還未能明瞭，但我們相信，或不至增加一倍有餘吧？所以要維護國內產業，挽救工商危機，除掉政治上的措施以外，依舊要希望全體國民實行節約，樂用國貨。這雖是老生常談，到底是根本要圖。</p>
<h3>馬帥調處的評價</h3>
<p>馬歇爾元帥，由美來華，迄今七個多月。他任杜魯門總統的特使，調處中國內部的政爭與兵爭，希望憑他的信譽和威望，以及他超然客觀的態度，能夠促成中國的統一，負擔起聯合國一員的任務。馬帥除了三月間一度回美外，在中國奔走斡旋，實際至少有六個月光景，真所謂舌敝唇焦，苦心孤詣。我們，中國人民，對於他這種「披髪纓冠」「席不暇暖」的精神，祗有衷心感謝。目前調處工作，雖還沒有圓滿成就，但這是由於中國一部份好戰份子冥頑不靈之所致，決無損於馬帥之信譽與威望，而尤不足認爲中美邦交之阻梗。</p>
<p>我們對於馬帥在華調處工作的評價，雖然認爲「謀事在人，成事在天」，但始終相信，憑他的信譽，威望，超然，客觀，只須假以時間，持以毅力，則「至誠所之，金石爲開」，我們還是對於馬帥的調處懷着甚大的期待。</p>
<p>然而，中共却不然了！中共從前恐怕單獨和政府談判，或許要受欺，乃竭誠希望有美國居間調處。我們知道，中共　時之所以千方百計，透過美國記者的筆，呼籲中國必須組織聯合政府者，原是切望美國左袒共黨，壓迫中央的。故初則歡迎赫爾利將軍，繼又因赫爾利將軍不爲所用，乃一變而爲攻擊。迨馬帥奉命來華，中共又寄厚望於馬帥，不料七八個月以後，馬帥雖公平勸導，中共却又一變而爲攻擊馬帥，一若當日之攻擊赫爾利將軍。這一星期間，延安解放日報和　家口中共廣播電台的怪論，真是層出不窮。中共批評馬司聯合聲明，一再侮辱馬帥，不是說他「欺騙」，就是稱他「笨伯」，甚至硬說馬帥「調處其名，援蔣其實」，而下一個荒謬的斷語，以爲「七個半月調處援助出來一個更大的內戰」，好像中國的內戰，不是那居心　　蓄意逞兵的中共好戰份子所造成，而反是「不遠千里而來」的馬帥所手製的一般。中共昔日奉馬帥若「神明」。今天竟又視馬帥爲「騙子」，爲「笨伯」！</p>
<p>馬帥猶是也，調處猶是也，而中共對於馬帥調處的評價，今昔竟有天淵之隔。奇怪嗎？實在一些不奇怪！中共自有它的信條：「一切人都是工具，一切事都是過程」。馬帥本人，儘管是信譽威望，一時無匹的人物，馬帥的調處，儘管是超然客觀，萬衆共仰的工作，而在中共的心目中，馬帥還不是它一時「工具」，調處還不是它片刻的「過程」？</p>
<p>老實講，我們是早就　破中共的把戲的。中共此時之所以終必攻擊馬帥者，無非希望把中國問題提到國際去仲裁罷了！質言之無非祈禱讓蘇聯來幫助中共叛國罷了！延安一面大呼「掮起槍來」，「不惜一戰」，一面却又大喊「無條件停戰」，希望聳動國際聽聞，來一個共同「處分」中國，這　「大快於心」。中共這種做法，自然有它的師承；只是美國朋友夠爽快，夠天真，我們以前說中共未必有信用，他們却或認爲言之過甚，而今中共的面目，大概可以認識清楚了吧。</p>
<p>不過，我們要哪重再說明一點：以馬帥在美國，在中國，在國際所有之信譽與威望，始終耐性來調處中國政爭，如果不幸而仍無效果，那恐怕中國的和平至少暫時真正要絕望了。馬帥是美國人的典型；馬帥今天所不能做到事，我們敢說將沒有第二個人可以做到。以馬帥這樣苦心調處的和平老人，而尚可謾罵之爲「騙子」，爲「笨伯」，則以後更有何人不可罵？此不但侮辱馬帥，而且無異侮辱我們所有的美國盟友。這種無禮的詆毀，雖出諸中共黨人之口，而他們究竟還應該算「中國人」，我們站在中國人民的立塲上，對馬帥，對美國，非常感覺慚愧。因此，我們還是懇切希望：馬帥得司徒大使的協力，依然繼續努力調處，爲中國，也爲美國，更爲世界和平而繼續調處，強制執行，息爭的辦法，萬不可因中共的激怒而撤手返美，使遼東的火種遺留不熄！這是中國人民的呼聲！</p>

<h3>勝利一年來　廣大地區仍遭封鎖　經濟混亂人民惶惑</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕日本投降後一年，中國仍多被征服國家之記號－人民惶惑·失望·渙散·經濟情形混亂不定，然經中國多年英雄抵抗，協助打敗之日本，反於復興安定方面有長足進步，實際已走上民主大道，此爲一種悲慘的諷刺。日本雖戰敗，今日已獲享和平利益，而中國巨人之病軀，則繼續遭戰爭殘破，自相分裂。人民在廣大之幅員內，不能自由往來，大片地方仍遭緊密封鎖，洪水飢饉與恐懼瀕臨全境，於此悲慘情形之下，各國雖已相率復員，而中國仍維持龐大之常備軍，國家支出三分之二屬於軍費，數百萬面目憔悴之人民，則與死亡掙扎，一無保護。在此黑暗景象中，其唯一光明之點，厥爲各方面皆在高呼必須達到民主，平等與繁榮，惟迄今祇有空言，並無實際，國人已漸厭聞，失其信仰。如欲解決中國積弊，必須有一意志堅強之領袖，至於如何實行，並無所謂秘密。據專家意見，其主要步驟如下：（一）無條件永久和平，（二）恢復交通，（三）穩定幣制，（四）減低捐稅，（五）補助本國工業，保障外人投資，（六）房租物價，嚴行管制，（七）縮編軍隊。中國今日不惜以數十億國幣維持大軍，從事內戰，而於首都馬路，似無充分款項修理，房荒情形，亦頗緊急，並無頭等客寓可供假宿，京中唯一西式旅館，由美國軍官及其平民秘書佔住，不准非軍人入內，房租不受統制，南京外國記者俱樂部新址，其全年租金爲國幣五千萬元，約合美金二萬元，即此可見一斑。物價雖平，但未降落，平常一餐之費，約需美金三元以上，硬胎太陽帽一頂，在美國僅售兩角五分，此間須合到美金四元左右。一瓶啤酒需美金一元，一只橘子三角，一份報紙需一角二分，此非稀物，亦非黑市價格，從未聞有統制之事，南京全新汽車或近乎全新之汽車甚少，大多數爲吉普車·兵器車·不知年齡之運貨車與人力車。食物價昻，致公務員多寗願去職，中國經濟將於何時底　盡露，此爲現在京中最風行之猜測。</p>

<h3>加爾各答動亂未已　尼赫魯真納同聲譴責暴徒　印臨時政府下週可望成立</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據聯合社電：國大黨主席尼赫魯十七日自孟買飛返新德里後，即與印督魏菲爾會談，提出關於設立臨時政府之建議，惟結果如何，雙方均守口如瓶。總督府只發表一極簡單公報，謂雙方曾舉行組織臨時政府之初步談判，不久並將續談。據路透社新德里電，依目前動態推測，印度新臨時政府將由大會黨六人，非回敎聯盟代表五人，錫克族一人，印度基督敎一人及派西敎一人組成之。該項名單明日作最後決定後，即將提交國大黨執委會國會小却委員會之全體會議審議。衆信臨時政府之組織，下週初或可望成立。</p>
<p>加爾各答中部十七日發生之暴動，人民死傷極衆，放火·搶刧·刀刺之事屢見不鮮，入晚印度敎徒與回敎徒羣衆之激戰，亦仍在進行中。怒吼喧嘩聲，玻璃破碎聲，更加上英軍彈壓之槍聲，密如聯珠，織成一片恐怖的交響曲，居民多蟄伏屋內，不敢外出。電報總局，郵政總局等重要機關附近，俱有軍警嚴密戒備，不肖之徒多要機趁火打刧，搶掠商店，警察開槍射擊，街上血跡斑斑，若干屍體尙未經人認領，救護人員竟日忙碌異常。魏菲爾總督及孟加拉行政首長，頻頻於電話中商談，事態之嚴重可以想見。十八日晨，衝空曾再度發生，警察並於數處開槍彈壓，情形更趨嚴重。三日來死傷情形，雖無正式統計，但據加爾各答晨報估計，死者當逾六百，傷者在二千五百人以上。</p>
<p>對於此種暴動騷亂，國大黨主席尼赫魯及回盟領袖眞納，曾一致加予譴責。據法國新聞社新德里電，尼赫魯謂，我國前途不能以流氓手段決定之。眞納亦謂，余極反對此類暴行，此爲犯罪行爲，血案之負責人員應依法懲辦。各回敎徒對此事件，頗爲不安，因其後果顯足以妨害回敎同盟之令譽也。孟加拉省各政治領袖亦舉行會議，並廣播呼籲各方鎭靜，以維秩序。</p>
<p>印度敎與回敎領袖十八日即舉行會議商討恢復城區和平一項問題，常日並持有大會黨與回敎聯盟旗幟之隊伍行經各街，促人民「維持和平與問胞之感情」，並高呼「印同人民聯合」之口號尼赫魯及眞納並曾親赴各區，籲請羣衆力持鎭靜，惟加爾各答目前情形仍極惡化。</p>

<p>〔本報綜合消息〕紐約時報記者稱：巴黎和會於十七日已結束其第三星期之會議。在昨日之會議中，先後以十六票對六票及一致同意通過邀請奧地利與伊朗列席陳述意見，據合衆社訊，奧國外長格魯勃已於今日啓程赴法。</p>
<p>下次大會日期未定</p>
<p>和會下次全會將於何日舉行，日期尙未規定，但主席王世杰先前曾宣佈阿爾巴尼亞，墨西哥，古巴與埃及將於星期二出席陳述意見。昨日自奧地利與伊朗出席問題解決後，蘇聯代表團在大會中並未建議阻止法國在羅，保，匃，芬和約草案審査委員會有表決權利，或阻止美國在芬蘭和約草案審査委員會中有表決權利。按蘇聯代表團前曾在各和約草案審査委員會中，分別提出此點。</p>
<p>美蘇雙方互相指責</p>
<p>據路透社訊，和會自開始舉行以來至昨日爲止，已充份顯示與會各國，業已形成兩個對立之集團。美參議員范登堡奉國務卿貝爾納斯之召，今日已啓程前往巴黎，臨行時曾對蘇聯表示不滿，聲稱，「蘇方自始即不斷阻止對奧地利與德國重大問題之調査，不知居心何在」，並堅決反對向任何外國洩露原子彈秘密或放棄以原子彈爲武器，直至有充份安全保障時爲止。</p>
<p>同時莫斯科電台昨夜曾廣播達維杜夫之「時事述評」，對美國最新之四萬五千噸航母「羅斯福」號以及其他艦艇即將訪問地中海東部一點，提出强硬之批評，認爲美國正向制霸世界之途邁進，不久每一國家即將在美國飛機之飛行圈，並稱美國所重視者，並非國際合作而係原子炸彈。自各方之態度觀之，和會前途，實屬荆棘叢叢。</p>
<p>法國呼籲勸告息爭</p>
<p>法國激進社會黨之「黎明報」載稱，「美國務卿貝爾納斯與蘇外長莫洛托夫意見不合，足以危及和會，至爲顯然。美國反對蘇聯擴張勢力企岡控制整個歐洲，與其以前反對納粹德國企圖統治歐洲，實出同樣理由，並非由於思想不同所致。法國總統皮杜爾所以請求和會息爭，亦即在此。」故加拿大代表向五强呼籲消除分裂狀態，俾會議得以迅速進展之言，實屬中肯。</p>
<p>休會問題發生爭論</p>
<p>據法國新聞社訊：巴黎盛傳和會將休會，俾使各國代表得往紐約出席聯合國大會，但蘇聯代表團已公開反對和會休會，並主張和會不能如期結束，則聯合國大會應延期舉行。美國代表團之立塲如何，尙未明朗，但聞同意對義，羅，保，匈，芬五國之和約草案，須於聯合國大會開幕之前審議完畢。至於英國代表團之意見，則認爲和會與聯合國大會不能同時舉行，但各國代表在紐約時，和會各委員會仍可照常舉行。惟此舉必將引起若干困難，各國代表團國長，如不出席和會各委員會，即難望獲得具體進展。法國代表團綜合各方意見，認爲和會之主要任務，乃在簽訂關係重大之和約，聯合國大會自應延期舉行。</p>
<p>貝訪文外相週內出席</p>
<p>南非聯邦內閣總理史末資將軍可望於明日抵此，爲該國代表團團長出席和會。此外美國參議負范登堡與康納利均將於日內抵巴黎，加强美國代表團陣容。英國外相貝文將自下星期起出席和會。下星期一，各委員會將討論和約草案，鑒於各方態度之不一，勢必發生激烈之爭辯。</p>
<h3>日臨時賠償計劃　美國正在考慮中　意在援助中菲復興經濟　此議或將提交遠東委會討論</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕據此間消息靈通方面稱：美國務院及陸海軍當局，刻正考慮一種臨時賠償計劃，授權麥克阿瑟將軍准許日本資產立即運往受戰事損害之國家，但以不超過每種工業估計總値百分之二十爲限。該項計劃或將提交遠東委員會討論。美國所以提出此項計劃，蓋欲及早利用日本剩除物資，以助中國及菲律賓之經濟復興。</p>
<p>日擬設賠償局</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十八日取電〕日本政府刻正攷虛設立賠償局，以處理拆除，裝箱，運輸，約一千萬噸工業設備，並主持其紀錄事宜，蓋此等設備將由日本運出，作爲實物賠償也。是項工作刻由中央聯絡局執掌，然在實際推行工作，需要特殊技術與經騐，故須另設一機構，可能直屬內閣。</p>
<h3>各國記者在法　憑弔戰蹟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播：列席和會之各國新聞記者四十人，由荷蘭記者卡埃潑引導，同往哈佛港憑弔戰蹟。常地人士謂：全城百分之卅六被毁，房屋一萬幢完全炸平，淸掃工作現正進行中，需費十萬萬法郞云。</p>
<h3>蘇報著文譏刺英美　意稱世界絕對不能平等</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十七日電〕「新時代雜誌」刊載長篇論文，指責英美有勢力之帝國主義份子，企圖利用聯合國機構，作爲其擴火政策之工具，並謂廢除一致通邊表決之原則，等於阻止國際合作之基礎。吾人決不能否認大國之支持和平，重要不在小團之上。歷如聖薩爾瓦多決不能與英國相比，廬森堡亦豈能與美國國效顰，故就支持和平之重要性一點而論，世界各國乃絕對不能平等者。美國代表在若干國際會議中，曾坦白承認其背後有二十個拉丁美洲國家之支持，在此種情形下，且能談及「圾多數原則」之頃價値，故平等之說，僞君子之辭耳。</p>
<h3>勞工國家化議案　菲議會通過　我僑商受影響</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺十七日專電〕非衆議院已二讀通過勞工國家化議案，該議案係衆議員蒂遜於七月十七日提出者，是案對此間我僑商之影響最大，因其中規定任何私營會社或公司內所隸用菲籍公民薪水之總額，凡在所隸全體員工每月薪水總額百分之六十者，即不准營業或從事任何置賣。又菲參議院已二讀通過公開市塲國家化之議案，此案旨在將公開市塲之華籍零售商驅除盡淨。</p>
<h3>我國護士十人前日抵美受訓</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕中國護士十人今日抵此，準備加入護士技衛速成班受訓，期間定爲四個月。聯總署長賴伽第亞已擬有改進中國及其他各國醫藥設備之計劃，將由美陸軍護士團予以實施。</p>
<h3>巴基斯坦問題在膠着狀態中　倫敦會議本月內可望召開　美與各國商處理歐洲難民</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕巴勒斯坦問題，尙在膠着狀態之中。據路透社巴黎電，員文十七日未出席和會全體會議，而竟日留於旅館中，與甫自倫敦抵此之殖民大臣霍爾會商。猶太領袖，則在等候英政府對其初次建議之答覆，前來此與貝文商談巴勒斯坦問題之海相亞歷山大，已於十八日啓程返巴黎，預料局勢在二三日內當有所開展。</p>
<p>各方矚目之巴勒斯坦會議，據法國新聞社倫敦電，英外部發言人已聲明將於本月內舉行，其日期當待阿拉伯聯盟七國，曁猶太復國運動會派遺代表，然後再行確定。若干阿拉伯國家已拒絕與猶太代表同時出席會議，因此業已決定猶太人及阿拉伯人雖同時參加會議，但將在不同地點分別舉行，衆信此種手續，將使會議情形複雜而需時更久。但英國政府準備延長會議，直至獲得各方均能滿意之協議而後已。</p>
<p>非法猶太移民突破英封鎖綫</p>
<p>路透社耶路撒冷消息，偷越過英封鎖綫之非法猶太移民，仍有增加。據聯合社電，海發之猶太難民一千四百人，原擬於十六日晚由運兵船兩艘押往塞浦魯島，但因遭反對作罷，難民拒絕離開其原乘船隻，並有猶太人數千名羣集示威，抗議放逐難民。事實上歐洲之難民問題實一整個嚴重問題，據法國新聞社華盛頓電，美代理國務卿艾克遜十七日曾聲明，美政府已與其他國家（按當指英國）開始直接或經由聯合國機構進行談判，俾能便利歐洲難民之移植。目前歐洲無家可歸之難民，估計當達一百萬人之多</p>

<h3>溥儀證言重要　舉世人士矚目</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京十八日電〕遠東國際法庭之審判，因溥儀作證，愈見其歷史性的重大意義。十六日溥儀之隱逸，究　　本莊業。板垣征四郞等企圖組織僞滿及迫爲僞　之陰謀策動，暴露無遺，如聲如繪，予人印象甚深。因渠已脫　傀儡皇帝束縛，故　暢所欲言。　情吿發，　儀之誰言，須於一週間方能陳述完畢，刻舉世人士，對此均極樂觀。</p>
<h3>韃靼尼爾海峽問題　對蘇覆牒延未發出　土耳其舉棋莫定　英美將正式闡明態度</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據法國新聞社安哥拉訊：土耳其政府　蘇聯要求修改蒙德葉公約之覆文，一時尙不致送出。因土國政府首先欲諮詢修約直接有關各國之意見，而各該國之意見迄未正式表示。但一般觀察，土耳其對蘇聯所提要求，殆將加以拒絕，其理由爲蘇聯之照會內容等於取消公約而贊成地城協定，因此連犯原約之精神。且該約簽訂於一九三六年，其有效時期爲二十年，應至一九五六年始乃失效，此際無理由作廢。口蘇聯之提議至少應獲得另一簽字國之支持。</p>
<p>又據路透社倫敦訊：英外交部亦如美國，正忙於起草正式宣言，閘明其對修正蒙特婁公約之態度，預料英政府之聲明，不久即可遞交莫斯科及安加拉。英國之能度，係認蘇聯之要求修正，就其照會所述而觀，與公約原所規定之修正條件不相符合。英國認爲蒙特婁公約之修正，應由各原簽字國協商，此外由於環境之變遷，似應美國參加，而拒絕原簽字國中之已成前敵國者如保加利亞羅馬尼亞及日本等國參預。</p>
<p>至於美國能度，則可於美代理國務卿艾克遜昨日之談話見其一斑。艾氏謂美國對此問題，將重申貝爾納斯國務卿於一九四五年十一月七日所採之立塲。査是日貝爾納斯概述美國對韃靼海峽之政策，其要點有四：（一）韃靼海峽在一切情形之下，務須對各國開放商船運輸，以免一旦發生戰爭時，土耳其利用海峽封鎖敵國之商船運輸，韃靼海峽之地位應與蘇彝士與巴拿馬兩運河相等。（二）美國要求韃靼海峽對黑海沿岸各國所屬兵艦，隨時開放航行。（三）其他各國所屬兵艦，應禁止通過海峽，惟平時規定之通過噸數，黑海某一國特別准許或聯合國管轄下之兵艦，則屬例外。現行條約規定黑海沿岸以外各國所有兵艦之通過噸數，以四萬噸為限，但貝爾納斯暗示可以考慮新數字。（四）美國將提議「刷新」蒙德婁公約若干點，有如聯合國機構之代替國際聯盟然，並將日本　棄於簽約處之外，貝氏此項聲明與蘇聯之主要要求一相比較，即可知美國將支持土耳其而反對蘇聯之要求。蓋以蘇聯要求樹立土蘇聯防基地，新公約以黑海沿岸各國爲限，對於聯合國機構則未提及故也。蘇聯若堅持其要求，則美蘇兩國間恐將發生新的緊張局勢。美國四萬五千噸航空母艦「羅斯福」號及英美其地兵艦數艘之出巡地中海，不能不令人發生權力示威之印索。</p>

<h3>納粹德國秘密文件　暴露進攻英倫計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕紐倫堡美國檢察長賈克遜，爲審案所搜集之證件中，有一希特勒於一九四〇年七月十六日所簽字之重要秘密文件，內容透露希特勒曾於一九四〇年八月擬自巧姆斯蓋特至懷特島之遼闊陣綫間，發動進攻英格蘭之戰事。其命令略謂：「英國今雖已陷於軍事絕望之境地中，但仍無降服之意。余現已決定在必要時，準備在英格蘭實行登陸。此一作戰目的，乃在毀滅英國對德進行戰爭之國內根據地，倘屬必要，將予完全佔領。登陸時將在遼闊之陣綫上，自拉姆斯蓋特至懷特島迤西，以突襲方面行之，以空軍代替炮兵之任務，海軍代替工兵之任務，能否在全面登陸前，降此佔領懷特島或康華爾羣，然後決定以後行動。着將此議結果，即行向余報告，余現保留此決議，全部準備需至八月間始可完成。」按英倫之戰，乃於一九四〇年八月八日開始，九月十五日發展至頂點，當時英空軍曾於一日間擊落德機一百八十五架，德軍總部遂不得不展緩其進攻，而至最後放棄云。</p>

<h3>美全國水閘工程之父　老議員瑙雷斯（上）</h3>
<p>畢生盡瘁於水利事業　本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>〔諾克斯微爾七月二十五日航訊〕TVA這一座東南山地中的傑作，不僅是美國的成就，也是世界的成就。原子炸彈的造成，靠TVA供給的高度電動力，至今，橡樹坡（在諾克斯微爾城外）的原子炸彈製造廠，還牽連在TVA的電力發動機上面。美國人有一股天眞的建設的傻勁，有時候，也有一種極浮表的幽默。在TVA瑙雷斯大水閘附近不遠，豎著一幅大路牌：「請參觀十八世紀的TVA。」我因爲好奇，要導遊的戈爾碧先生陪我參觀，那是在一座山溝裏築著的大木輸子，中國江浙一帶叫作木輪水風車</p>
<p>溪水從高處流下，轉動木論，木輪用軸連接至室內，可以椿米打殼。同行的比利時最高法院的柏希法官，望著不懂，戈爾碧問我：「中國有沒有這玩意？」我說：「鄉村中現在還很多，但在大城市是看不到的。」彼此都笑著點頭。其實，水風車在美國中西部，到現在還有存在，特別在印第安那人居住的山谷裏。文明本來是逐步進步的，沒有十八世紀的原始水風車，也許不會有今天的TVA。同時，人類的文明，也靠人類的努力，這種努力是艱鉅的，是人類社會求取進步的心血結品。芝加哥大學的敎授李漫，今年六月，在芝加哥作了一次極長的演講，</p>
<p>介紹TVA的成績。他說：從一九二七年到一九三二年之間，東歐有一個國家，完成了一件舉世注目的大工程，那便是合尼伯河上的大水閘，這個水閘的完成，背後由一位「萬能」的獨裁者在主持，所以工程進展神速，成效也特別顯著。這種高越的速度，在一個意見紛歧的民主國家是做不到的。在美國，同樣一位大思想家，他呼籲水利建設，畢生四十年，到臨死以前才獲見完成，這位美國的大思想家，便是喬治，威廉，瑙雷斯。沒有瑙雷斯，美國沒有TVA，沒有那樣順利的造出原子彈</p>
<p>沒有瑙雷斯，羅斯福總統的新政，不會那麽輝煌，沒有瑙雷斯，十八世紀的水風車，還滿佈在田納西的深山　谷之間。當林肯總統爲解放黑奴，號召內戰的那一年，瑙雷斯生於渥亥渥州的聖特斯基城，他的家庭是貧困的，幼年過著艱苦奮鬥的日子，他在渥亥渥受敎育，長大後學習法律。一八八五年，當他廿四歲的時候，隻身飄泊到拿不拉斯加州，在那兒充當律師，那時候美國正當南北戰爭以後，社會經濟有著一日千里的發展，同時因爲西移運動的成果，各方面都需要人才。年靑的瑙雷斯的才具</p>
<p>不久遂被拿不拉斯加州的人的所賞識，他當選了第十四區的法官。到一九〇二年，瑙雷斯以共和黨員的身份，當選了國會下議院的議員。從那一年起，便開始了他四十年的議會生涯。</p>
<p>在華盛頓國會衆議院席上，瑙雷斯是以剛直敢言著稱的一個。他雖然籍隸共和黨，但堅決反對政黨獨裁，他認爲國家的利益，應該高於黨的利益，他標揭議員的責任，在對國家，而非對政黨。現任聯總署長，前任紐約市長賴伽第亞，那時候和瑙雷斯在國會是志同道合的朋友，他們倆聯合發動一個「反對黨魁命令運動」，以阻止政黨少數人操縱國會。同時，瑙雷斯在國會提倡合作制度</p>
<p>主張施放農貸，以改善二十世紀初年的美國農民生活。早在二十世紀初年，瑙雷斯即對水力水利特別有興趣，他建議拿不拉斯加州的州政府，貸款給農民，以開發西部的土地。美國西部靠近落磯山的幾州原來都很荒僻，瑙雷斯主張修建潘斯芬特水閘於威瓦明州之北潑萊脫河，一方面利用水力，一方面開發農田。一九一二年的夏天，瑙雷斯有一個小小的旅行，他在哥侖比亞河上，望見流水滾滾，望見自然界無窮潛伏着的動力，棄置於地，不加利用，非常婉惜。他又看見河旁的農家，仍然燃着菜油燈，益感嘆着人間的矛盾。他寫信給他的朋友說：「我感嘆上帝的恩典，我們都辜負了不知應用。我必須要爲這些事，叫破喉嚨呼喊，叫美國人認識水利工程</p>
<p>但我發誓，如果我的計劃成功了，我必須堅決反對這些利益讓私人獨占，這是上帝普賜給美國人的，應該由政府控制，由政府普惠給人民。兩年以後，舊金山赫吉赫溪河谷利用水力發電廠的計劃，通過於國會。但華盛頓市內怕都滿河大瀑布發電的計劃，却在國會遭到了挫折，瑙雷斯的立塲非常堅定，他贊成美國全國的水利，應該國營，他反對怕都滿電力公司，攏斷華盛頓數百萬市民的福利。</p>

<h3>·居留在上海的·　蘇僑和白俄　人口多少迄無正確統計　赤白之間顯分兩個陣營</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在此時此地，記者願報道一些本市蘇僑和白俄的現狀。</p>
<p>僑居本市的蘇僑和白俄人數到底有多少？這至今還是一個謎，因爲還沒有一個機關能供給正確的統計。據某一位官方人士告訴記者，約在一萬五千至五萬之間，（一個多大的不確定範圍），據蘇僑方面自己的估計，則在二萬以上。</p>
<p>在從前，上海人稱流浪的白俄爲羅宋人，而且往往在後面還拖上兩個難聽的字，多少帶些侮衊的意味。現在大多數的白俄已取得了蘇維埃公民的資格。蘇聯政府曾經以種種便利，使這些白俄們歸化，領事館規定白俄取得國籍的辦法極爲簡便，祗要他們提供以前曾是俄羅斯人民的證件，如果沒有這種證件時，有蘇維埃公民兩人保證其爲俄羅斯人民，也就可以了。但是儘管如此，不少白俄由於數十年沙皇制度下的生活，其思想已根深蒂固，他們不贊成現政府的政策，也不願意取得公民的資格。</p>
<p>因此，上海俄國人的組織，就分成兩個顯著的陣營：「赤色」的「蘇聯僑民協會」，和「白色」的「俄僑總會」，人數約爲三與一之比。前者的主席是齊非洛夫，後者的主席是鮑哥洛夫。「赤」與「白」之間，曾經有過很尖銳的鬥爭，尤其在敎堂產業的所有權，宗敎信仰的領導權，和公共事業的辦理方面，都有很露骨的表現。從趨勢上看，白俄是在沒落中，最近鮑哥洛夫宣佈，說他的團體，不含政治作用，僅爲結合那些不慣於蘇聯法制的俄人的組織而已。</p>
<p>對於那些歸化的俄僑，蘇聯政府並沒有強迫回國的規定。相反地，倒有很多人，因爲在這裏生活困難而自動地要求回國，已在請領護照中。一個多月以前，有五十九個無依無靠的白俄孩子，已被遺送回蘇聯的公立機關裏去受撫養。</p>
<p>蘇僑和白俄的職業範圍，是很廣泛的，他們大多數受僱於公司機關任工程師，技術人員，製革匠，司機等，此外自由職業如醫生·護士等亦不少，再其次是商人和小工，失業的人數不多，對於他們，「僑民協會」有食堂衣服等的濟助。</p>
<p>目前蘇僑的活動，由於房屋的難覓，大都集中在福煦路八〇一號「僑民協會」裏，在那裏他們還辦了一個小學，最近還預備另外開辦一個可以容納十班學生的中學。至於白俄方面，除了經常在　利路和勞爾頓路角的敎堂裏，可以見到他們的踨跡外，其他的活動，也就有限得很了。</p>

<h3>渝總工會與勞協糾紛　谷正綱派員澈查　朱學範等請求具體解決</h3>
<p>爲重慶勞協機構彼非法強佔事件，赴京請願代表陶百川·朱學範·周學湘等一行，除陶氏已於十七日先行返滬外，朱周二氏亦于昨晨返滬。朱氏發表晋京請願經過，據稱，中樞對此事件已予重視，社會部將派包華國·組織部將派彭爾康兩氏，赴渝會同處理。本人希望四項要求得獲圓滿結果，尤其勞協被捕人員應立即釋放云。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕關於渝市總工會接收中國勞動協會重慶辦事處及其附屬機構一事，頗爲國內外人士所注意，記者爲明瞭真相，經向有關各方面探悉，中國勞動協會係專以研究勞工問題，舉辦勞工福利事業爲目的之文化團體，並非工會，自接受美國勞工界捐款每年美金五十萬至七十萬元，折合國幣爲數已在百數十億之鉅，各地工會以其用途從未公開，且不專辦勞工福利事業，有失捐助原意，年來已迭有呈控，屢起糾紛，去年參政會大會時，亦曾有參政員指摘，該會經費既不公開，活動又超越範圍，此次重慶市總工會第三次代表大會，一致決議以該勞協所收美捐鉅款，供私人揮霍，作其他活動，欺騙勞工，妨害生產，除向法院控告外，並籲請市政府查究，一面竟自行接收，顯係團體與團體間之糾紛，社會部谷部長自廬山返京後，即經派員前往，秉公澈查，依法處理。至所傳勞協職員有被逮捕情事，聞係另因地方治安關係，現亦由主管方面電請迅於查明辦理，其無關者，自可釋放。</p>

<h3>發售平價糖　市民多叫苦</h3>
<p>關於本市南貨業平價食糖之配售，最近市民頗多煩言，皆因若干南貨店欲將是項食糖一部份轉售黑市，或有全部拒絕發售所致。茲據滬光社記者所悉：目前一般南貨店發售平價糖時間，大都定自下午一時至三時，事實上發售時間皆在一時半以後，售至二時許，即謂「貨已售完」爲詞，或拖延發售日期，初謂貨未配到，直至截止發售日之下午，方始應酬一二，敷衍了事，而一般市民因欲購得是項價格較廉之食糖，大都自十二時起即列隊等候，少則數十，多則百計，終鮮達到目的，尤以「黃牛黨」時常活躍，使一般市民更乏購得之機會，故亟盼當局設法改善，俾使市民皆可平均享受是項權利云。</p>

<h3>國際海事會議席上　我海員獲廣大同情　種族歧視榮譽地得到勝利　勞方代表王雅倫凱旋歸來</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在最近舉行的國際海事會議席上，中國代表團爲國外華籍海員的被歧視而展開了鬥爭，結果是勝利了。中國勞方代表王雅倫先生，日前由美凱旋歸來，記者從他那裏得到了許多實貴的資料。</p>
<p>號稱八十萬中華海員，都是勇於冒險不怕漂泊的男兒，大多數華僑，都是遠涉重洋的海外海員。—「華僑與海員分不開。」</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰中，國外海員爲戰爭服役的不在少數，而在南洋各地，由於日本的侵入，那些華籍海員，更多直接參加了聯合國作戰。</p>
<p>但是我們國外的海員，處處被歧視。這是一種種族的歧視（Racial　Discrimiation），除了美國，以平等待我海員外，在英國，在荷蘭（荷蘭的航海商原屬英國系），我們的海員，都被加以種種不平的待遇。在海事公約上，中國海員被公然地列入「亞洲與菲洲人」的特殊待遇項下，但他們在字面上，却很巧妙地說「爲了尊重亞洲與菲洲人的風俗習慣。」就在這種不平的公約規定下，我們在英荷等國航商輪船上服務的海員，每月薪金只有七鎊（合廿八元美金）。更有甚者，華籍海員在他們船上的Living　Space，僅及白色海員的三分之二。所以，英荷商的輪船駛經美國時，船上中國海員有的開了小差。這並不是逃職，而是反抗無理的歧視。</p>
<p>事實上中國的海員能力並不比他們歐洲人差，他們的輪船公司老闆也曾經對王雅倫先生說：「華籍海員，很聰明，很賣力，唯一的缺點，就是不大聽話，不很賣賬」。王先生很乾脆地答道：「這是由於你們歧視所使然。」</p>
<p>我代表正義的爭</p>
<p>在這次海事會議上，對於這些不平等的待遇，以及海事公約中的文字上對有色海員的歧視，中國代表團曾作有力的抗爭，結果榮耀地勝利了。美國的新聞記者對此，曾經作同情的贊助。西雅圖的Seattle　Star等報，都以顯著的地位標題：“　Chinese　Plan　Fight　Against　Discrimination”我們出席大會的代表們（尤其是勞方代表），照片常常出現在美國的報紙，標題里都極同情中國海員的反對種族歧視。</p>
<p>在大會裏，雅然未曾沒有人嫉妬我們，但這正是由於我們在會議中聲音很响亮。</p>
<p>這會議的整個名稱是「國際勞工大會海事會議」，在系統上，它是「已故」國聯的遺屬，但由於事實上的需要，由於海員機構在世界上尚有活力，它仍然存在，這次開的是第二十八屆會議。聽說將來將屬於聯合國組織（U．N．O）了。</p>
<p>這一會議，在去年十一月間，曾經在丹麥京城哥本哈根召開了預備會議，我們代表團反對種族歧視的鬥爭，在那時既已展開。</p>
<p>正式會議於今年六月十日在西雅圖開始，一連舉行了三個星期，有許多次都是澈夜會議的。美國爲了盡地主之誼，招待得無微不至，使與會的數百代表，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>決定了海員待遇</p>
<p>我國的代表團一共十四個人，政府代表爲包　國·李平衡·勞方代表王雅倫（中華海員工會秘書），資方代表　作孚，其餘十位都屬顧問或秘書。</p>
<p>大會裏分設許多小組委員會，我們參加的是工資小組，船上設備小組，海員社會保險小組，伙食小組。</p>
<p>結果，在工資上，已決定國際海員最低標準，爲每月十六鎊，海員的Living　Space最低限度爲每人二十二平方英尺，吃飯地點不在內。不過，關於工資一項，印度和馬來亞方面代表，却要求不要提得太高，因爲一經提高，船公司都不肯用印度和馬來的海員了，據說他們工作能力比較差，主要原因太懶惰。</p>
<p>據說會塲的情緒很緊張，英美雙方針鋒相對，他們倆對於海上控制權，競爭極烈。中國代表爲了整個國家的利益，勞資雙方對外一致，這是可喜的。不過有一件事情，使中國代表在會議席上，好像天天在跌價；那就是中國國內的戰亂，日益蔓延。我想遠處國外的僑胞，又何嘗沒有同感？</p>
<p>英美海員俱樂部</p>
<p>在英美，海員很受重視，因爲他們都重視海上的霸權。社會熱心人士，很多捐款建造俱樂部，供給海員享受。因爲他們經過長時期的航海生活後，應當得到些安慰。王雅倫秘書參觀了美國的海員福利事業和海員敎育後，得到許多可供參考的制度。美國的海員俱樂部裏。有時候有許多贊助海員福利的婦女，專陪海員跳舞喝酒，但是有固定的時間；舞會結束時，這些伴舞小組或太太先海員而出，而且一離開俱樂部，她們就不再負安慰的責任，而板起面孔，互不認得了。這很有趣，也很可說明美國對海員的重視，無微不至。</p>
<p>紐約有一個海員訓練學校，創辦于戰時，分期訓練海員，設備非常完善。此外還有官方主持海員工會及勞方主持的工會，前者是United　Seamen　Service（即U．S．S），後者是Seamen　Sevice　（即S．S），這兩機構對于海員的福利都時時刻刻地在改善。</p>
<p>華僑匯款表不滿</p>
<p>上面說過，「海員與華僑分不開」，王秘書又對記者附帶地轉達些美國華僑的意見。目前，華僑在美國，可謂黃金時代，繁榮程度，從來未有。但是國內的情勢，使他們無時無刻不在苦悶中。他們並不滿意共黨的殘酷與蠻幹，但他們也希望政府官吏貪污的情事，能夠根絕。他們對祖國的愛，出于由衷，出于至誠。他們對于匯款問題很着急因爲中國官方銀行的經手僑滙，使他們非常不滿，有時候信都到了，滙款還無消息。現在他們許多款子都由香港去轉，這一漏扈極可痛惜！事實上在美僑胞，今日均很富有，平均每人都有二百美金一月，但是滙款回國的手續，政府又沒替他們辦妥。</p>
<p>末了，附帶報告些，中華海員工會的近況：它的總會在上海，現正辦理海員的復員工作。在國外，它有十一個分會，紐約的分會本來僅稱“Association”在美國法律上不是正式的法定工人團體，經過這次中國勞方代表的交涉後，已改稱爲中國海員“Union”的紐約辦事處。這樣子，在法律上地位大不同了。現在，海外的海員回國者很多，他們之中，很多乘了我國新近向美購買的輪船回國。回國海員向總工會登記的已有五千多人，由海員工會爲他們設法安插工作。工會方面，特設了一個復員委員會，專辦這一事情。</p>
<p>愛自由的人，都愛海，也愛過航海生活，我們祝福跋涉重洋的中華海員前路輝煌！</p>
<h3>麥根路貨站　平均每天吐納量　四千噸以上</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕麥根路貨站是京滬滬杭兩路的貨　　樞，這句話兩路當局也這樣認　。事實上也的確，兩路上再沒有一個站頭的貨運能比麥根路更繁忙些。麥根路站的吐納　，就是在全國的鐵路中，恐怕也是數一數二的了。最近消息傳來，說兩路管理局已擬定計劃大事改善麥根路站使成爲一個最完善的貨站，記者特地走詢路局的副局長兼運務處長侯或華氏，侯局長對件事也不大清楚，他祗知道要加添六公里長的軌道和三個「月台」，費用約十一萬萬元。全部工程要看密標的情形，大約三個月後或年底可以完工。至於其他的計劃，侯局長說：「還沒有出來」。</p>
<p>記者爲要明瞭未改善前的麥根路貨站情況，所以特地雇了車趕到站頭，因爲那天剛下過雨，所以迎着大门就是个大水潭，泥濘難走，好容易通過了這個「沼澤地帶」，再過去是堆物塲，而積倒不了，可是零亂得驚人，生了銹和灣曲了的鋼條，風吹日曬雨淋得發黑的破木箱，到處亂堆，行總的起重機和一些不知名的機器，不規則的斜躺着，磚頭瓦礫觸目皆是，假使現在還在戰爭期中，我一定以爲這裏剛被投過了炸彈。</p>
<p>站長室設在現在唯一可以使用的六號月台的一端，裏面有九隻破舊的寫字　，墻壁，地板，天花板早被灰塵染成深灰色，一進門一股異味叫人難受，蒼蠅成帬的飛，裏面暗洞洞的，光綫也實在太差，我會見了這裏的主人—楊文彬站長，楊站長陪我到處參觀，他說：「八年來遭敵人破壞太厲害了，現在什麼都感到不夠，以前有九個棧房，現在祗有一個了。掉車道現在大小還有二十條，但是沒有月台可以卸貨，所以貨車到處隨便亂停，祗要卡車可以開過去，他們（指小工）就隨地卸貨，因此格外顯得零亂無規則」。二條江（由蘇州河開鑿過來的）停着十多艘駁船，船上裝滿了一捆捆一包包行總的救濟貨資，正在起運上陸，據楊站長說：「行總的救濟物資，每天平均要運出一千噸以上」。</p>
<p>復員以來貨運數量每日在增加，現在麥根路貨站，每天運出的客貨約一千噸，運入的客貨約二千噸，再加上行總的救濟物資一千噸，平均每天的吐納量，總要在四千噸以上。於是倉庫大大的發生問題了，楊站長告訴我以前的一號倉庫現在被江海關接收着貯藏敵僞物資，二號三號被日軍拆毀了，四號五號租給行總堆置救濟物資，七號也被毀了，八號倉庫現分作三部份，一部份堆置敵僞物資，一部分租與行總，一部份站上自己使用，九號倉庫最大，現在是後勤部的材料倉庫，站上唯一使用的是六號倉庫兼月台，但是上面的鉛皮蓋已霉爛得七穿八洞，祗能遮遮太陽，一下雨還是和露天一樣。楊站長又領我參觀一個新建的汽車月台，面積不過兩張雙人寫字　大小，兩個是水泥砌成的，中間鬆鬆地陳着一層煤渣，記者參觀時，恰巧一家運輸公司，開來一輛載重三噸半空的道奇卡車，要由這個月台上開到火車上去，不料開到月台間一段，二隻後輪陷於煤渣中，不能自拔，輪子越是轉，陷得越是深，好半天才退下來，楊站長苦笑着對我說：「聽說這個月台的建築費要一千多萬呢」？</p>
<p>這站上的服務人員，共有一百三十六人，計有正站長一人，副站長三人，實習站長一人（交通大學學生）他們在這惡劣的條件下，努力地工作着，在無辦法中求辦法，維持這每天四千噸以上的貨運，這種精神是值我們嘉許的。</p>
<p>我的參觀於下午六時左右完畢，握別了和藹的楊站長，旋開了零亂的堆物塲，通過了泥濘的大水潭。歸途中不禁思潮起伏不定，我幻想着我國第一大都市貨運最繁忙的上海，是應該有怎麼樣的一個貨站。但我又回想到剛才所見到的情形，又不免茫茫然了。</p>
<h3>航業辦向美國　訂購大批船隻　開辟南北洋綫　短期內可實現　新輪二十艘業已抵滬</h3>
<p>記者昨往訪本市航業界負責人，就吾國目前航業近況及公佈固定航綫事，有所叩詢，據云：吾國戰前原有輪船達五十萬噸以上，抗戰期間爲敵僞摧毀殆盡，勝利後，政府向國外極力訂購船隻，以期恢復戰前運輸力，目前民營航商已有輪船達十七萬餘噸，國營招商局至本月十三日，所有船隻統計，自由輪十艘，勝利輪十六艘，N3十艘，LST登陸艇五艘，LSM登陸艇十艘，LCT六艘，YF大鐵駁四隻，油輪十一艘，護航艦二艘，水泥躉船一艘，以上七十五艘，係勝利後還滬復業至今所接敵僞之船舶及所購美國剩餘船隻。在川時尚有客貨江輪九艘，拖輪及小輪六艘，總共九十艘，計二十三萬五千八百十噸餘。聞該局尚有油輪七艘，小呂宋方面選購美國剩餘船隻，駁子，躉船，挖泥船等亦有百艘之多，一部份約下月初即可到滬。兩共相加噸位當已超過戰前，然目前國內各地航綫尚未固定，客貨運輸未能疏通者，因差運繁忙所致。最近民營航商已向美國訂購自五百噸起至五千噸止之大小輪六十艘，總數在十萬噸以上，其中二十艘業已抵滬，其餘四十艘亦已在首途中。故數月後，我國內航業當大可增進，至日前國內固定航綫，僅滬寗，滬溫及滬天生港三綫，其餘南北洋諸幹綫，所以未能指定船隻，訂定航運日期者，已如前述，受差運所限制，惟此後民營公司向美所購之船隻。源源來滬，吾國航運上之困難，當可迎刃而解。又據記者探悉：國營招商局頃正計劃開辟南北洋固定航綫，南洋航綫尚待吾國政府向當地政府簽訂通商互惠條約，故須略待時日，至北洋綫之船隻，頃正分配中，一俟差運稍稀，即可實行云。</p>

<h3>軍人無票乘車多　路局每月損失在二億元以上　警務處開始調查並設法取締</h3>
<p>今日軍人無票乘坐火車，已形成京滬兩路嚴重問題，每天達七八百名，以每名一萬元計，路局每天須損失七八百萬元，一月累計，當在二萬萬元以上，因此兩路警務處，自十一日起，派員調查，查得最近五天中，無票乘車軍人數額如次：</p>
<p>（日期）（無票軍人）（補票數目）</p>
<p>十一日　七〇一　二一七</p>

<p>十五日　八六五　二一九</p>
<p>總計三九四〇</p>
<p>總計一三八八</p>
<p>觀察以上數字，顯見軍人無票乘車之擁擠也。</p>
<h3>無票軍人·准乘慢車</h3>
<p>大通社記者對此特向兩路警務處探詢，據該處周專員表示，略謂軍人無票乘車，本處鑒於職責所在，同時以減除局方無形損失，決嚴予取締，今後不論任何軍職，如不依路局章程，一律請其搭乘慢車，如人數過擠時，可由路局附掛軍人乘坐車，此於路局行政及旅客旅行上，均獲得互相便利云云。</p>

<p>嗣記者自他方面獲悉實際情形，軍人乘坐火車，現可分析爲（一）現役軍人，（二）編餘軍人，（三）軍人眷屬，（四）冒充軍人，途中雖有少數經勸諭後照章補票，但以現役軍人爲多，而編餘軍人因生活關係，無錢補票，且多携帶眷屬三四名，所乘坐者，遑論特別快車，如滬杭西湖號汽油列車，及對號入座之京滬凱旋列車，均有彼等之足跡，致正式旅客，往往有票無座位，此於行駛秩序，自當亟應改進者。</p>

<h3>私校收費標準　中小聯會理事長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立中小學聯合會，自日前議決本學期學雜費標準後，各校敎職員　部認爲適當，而學生家長則頗有不勝負担之慮。記者特走訪該會理事長蔣紀周氏，承發表談話如次：「本會此次所定學雜費標準，爲小學八萬至十二萬元，初中十二萬元至十六萬元，高中十六萬元至二十萬元，並規定：（一）各校免費學額小學不得少於百分之二十，中學不得少於百分之十五。（二）此項學雜費包括圖書體育等一切雜費。（三）學校辦公購置費用以全部收入百分之二十五爲原則，至多不得超過百分之三十。各校若以上項標準之最低額，（小學八萬，初中十一萬，高中十六萬）收費，基免費及支配標準合於上項規定，而每級學生數達四十五人，（根據敎育局上學期統計小學平均每級四四·二人，中學平均每級四二·一人），每級敎職員小學一·五人，中學二人，則敎師月薪小學約二十四萬元，初中約二十九萬元，高中約三十五萬元。此項待遇雖略高於市校，然與銀行公司職員以及木匠·漆匠·印刷工人相較，仍覺不如，我人認爲如欲提高敎育效能，改進敎師質素，必先提高敎師待遇，使敎師不僅生活安定，且有餘力足以進修與休間。實際上，各校每級學生數往往不足四十五人，免費學額超過百分之二十與十五，而修理購置等費亦頗巨大，如欲維持上項敎師待遇標準，則不能不將上項收費額略予提高，以資彌補。即使有少數學校按照最高額收費，而其每級學生數仍有四十五人以上，則敎師月薪小學爲三十五萬左右，中學爲四十萬左右，以負荷敎育下一代國民職責之敎師，有此待遇，亦不爲過。值此社會經濟枯竭之際，學生家長不能負担此項學雜費者爲數必多，甚望各校　充免費及減費學額，不使有一學生因費高而失學，則敎師學生，兩得其利。至於學校經濟公開辦法，本會上學期已有決議云。</p>

<h3>全國敎育會議　爲完成敎部工作計劃　今冬或明春當可舉行</h3>

<h3>世界金銀問題　價格不斷上漲　國際情勢使然</h3>
<p>〔路透社孟買十七日電〕印度政府已將金銀進口稅降低，以鼓勵金銀之進口。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕經濟家週刊撰文稱，印度金銀進口稅之減低，事實上並不能使金銀多流入印度，因過去之問題，並非一關稅問題也，目前關稅即使減低以後，孟買銀價約爲每盎斯八〇·五辨士，金價約爲每盎斯十九鎊強，價格仍然如是之高，故戰時之阻礙不在關稅，而在其他國家之禁止出口及禁止輸入印度也。</p>
<p>〔路透社孟買十七日電〕某重要黃金經紀人今日接見路透社記者稱，金銀價格俱不斷上漲，係由於世界之情勢使然，目前國家，能在十分之一之金銀作爲其通貨之準備金者，已屬難能可貴，通貨皆作天文數字之澎漲，且似無法遏制，故印度政府雖用盡方法，遏止金價之上漲，結果仍難有若何效果。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十七日電〕本年工業界所需白銀，估價雖達一二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯之多，但目前財部所售出者，不過三，四〇〇盎斯而已，政府所存可以售出之白銀，有一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯，而結果售出者仍如此之少，蓋因政府售出之官價爲每盎斯九一分，而市塲售價則爲九〇3一8分也，結果政府只有買進極少賣出。</p>

<h3>成本太高交通不便　茶銷無從發展　茶商希望政府收買或津貼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日中國出口貨展覽會茶葉座談席上，據若干茶商向記者表示：以目前國內新茶之成本計，實無法推展外銷。緣國外茶葉市價，約較國內新茶成本價低廉三四成不等。茲姑以祁門紅茶爲例，目前新茶成本，高檔貨每担約四十六萬元，中檔貨約卅五萬元。然目前本市紅茶市價，高檔貨每担約十三萬元，低檔貨約七萬餘元。惟此項紅茶，多屬民國卅年至卅三年間之陳貨，與新茶不能相提並論。而一般茶農，以戰後茶價與糧價騰漲之比例相差甚遠。故大多棄茶植糧，以致茶葉產量銳減。估計現在之產量，尚不到戰前產量百分之四十。以此次東南區茶貸七十億元之產茶計劃言，產量亦僅及計劃中之三成。出口方面，戰前我國茶葉每年之輸出量，約爲一百萬箱。惟本年七個月中之總輸出量，尚不足五萬箱。據稱：我國東北蒙疆一帶，對茶葉之需要頗殷。設非交通阻滯，東南區此區區之產量，內銷尚不夠應付，固毋須仰恃外銷。然目前因製就之新茶成本，照預定估計相去過遠，故各茶商雖得到低利之茶貸，惟運用茶貸所製就之新茶，均告呆擱。聞此次工商請願團晋京時，茶商方面亦曾提出請求政府採取貼補政策，使華茶得以出口，或照新茶生產成本予以收買。各茶商且表示：目前政府似可從進口物資（如原棉等）所獲之利益，撥出一部份以貼補茶葉之出口，以資救濟云。</p>
<h3>勝利後的外匯變遷　本報資料室輯</h3>
<p>外匯的匯率，重新地修訂了，我國苦戰了八年，人民在生活綫上掙扎了八年；大家渴望着勝利和平，勝利和平終於實現了，可是物價反比抗戰時還漲得利害，人民的痛苦，也就更重。這一次外匯匯率的的變動，當然影響到物價，因爲外匯和物價是拆不開的。</p>
<p>自從太平洋戰爭開始，港滬兩地淪陷，我國對外匯市也全部停頓。重慶中央銀行的官價，起初規定爲一與二十之比率。後改爲一與二十，一與五〇〇。但勝利以後，一切經濟部門均待復員，進出口貿易也急待恢復。當然要另訂匯價。外匯匯率問題，一時成爲工商界討論的中心，蔣主席在去年十一月二十六日在最高經濟委員會首次會議席上，亦曾說：「爲達到增加各種工業生產，及其他經濟建設與發展的目的之先，最急要的是，確定對外匯率，來穩定金融。」可見政府對於這一問題，也很關切。但外滙問題仍遲遲未決，以是許多出口業工廠，觀望不前，對外貿易，陷於停頓。</p>
<p>本年二月二十五日國防最高委員會通過開放外滙市塲。指定銀行買賣外滙，廢除二十比一之滙價，由中央銀行另訂新匯率，並斟酌情形，供給或收買外匯，並以五億美元作爲法幣準備金。以是大家猜測新匯率的謎。迄三月四日，中國銀行公佈美匯電滙匯率爲二〇二〇比一。這時的黑市價格爲二〇三〇元，所以新匯率的決定，與黑市相接近。但這比率，是不及物價的倍數。按物價指數，以重慶爲例，爲戰前二三七三倍。而滙率的增加，還不到七〇〇倍；雖然美國的物價，較戰前也上漲了，但比較起來，法幣對外的價值，比對內的價值爲高。</p>
<p>新滙率公佈之後，許多人認爲其比例太低。進口貨源源而來，同時出口貿易因成本提高，而無法開展。是阻抑國內工業的發展，造成扼殺國民經濟的惡果。但政府所定的滙率，不是草率決定的，自必依據所定的國策，戰後我國要工業化，要獎勵生產工具的進口，滙率定得低，可以減低設廠的成本。假使滙率定得高了，許多機器運來，成本就要增加，大規模的工廠就無法開門。雖然國內有許多小規模的工廠，爲着要維持這許多小工廠，而把滙率提高，這是近視的看法。但在滙率決定以後，進口貨是增加了，可是並不是機器一類的生產工具，而多數還是消耗品。同時出口貨則陷於停頓。國內工廠無法開門，物價仍是不斷地上漲。政府在決定滙價的時候，想得很週到，可是結果相反，以是不得不將滙率的重行修正。</p>
<p>開放外匯市塲，是戰後政府對於經濟問題開始的一次重大行動。可是這政策，既不是完全放任的聽其自由發展，又並不對波動的物價加以釘住。這是政府不得已的辦法。僅從運用平準基金，控制外滙頭寸，管理進出口貿易諸干涉行動中，希望做到滙率不致大起大落。但政府對於進出口貿易不能完全控制，因爲市塲上美鈔流行，可以代替滙票。在戰前流行的美鈔，本爲數不多，及勝利以後，美國軍事人員大批來華，美鈔帶來不少，雖然美鈔流通的數量已增加不少，可是許多進口貿易商人大量的需要。在新滙率公佈的時候，反比美鈔貴，但是有許多進口貨因爲無法購買外滙，以是以美鈔收付。美鈔的需要增加，價格也隨之而漲，就超越了滙價。中央銀行的掛牌，雖然始終維持二〇二〇的比例，但美票却升至二千六七百元以上。財政當局一面吸收美鈔以減少市上的流通額，一面要求美方發薪時以法幣付給，如此，一來，美鈔在市上流通的數量，較前減少了。</p>

<h3>薄荷產銷之今昔</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國之產薄荷，不過近十餘年之事。民國十五年前，我國工業界及醫業上所用之薄荷原料，全部仰結於日本。迨民國廿年後，我國太倉及嘉定等地，開始種植薄荷。民國廿五年，種植區域逐漸擴展至南通，海門，啓東，崇明，常熟，杭州，江西以及上海近郊一帶，估計全國每年最高產量，曾達二萬担以上。該項產品，除一小部份供銷國內外，十九均係外銷。每年之輸出數值，除我國各種主要出口品爲桐油，豬鬃，生絲，茶葉等外薄荷可佔第五位，由此及彼可見薄荷一項，在我國輸出貿易上，所佔地位之重要。</p>
<p>據薄荷業中人談：我國薄荷事業，以民國廿六年至卅年一階段，爲黃金時代。據稱世界上生產薄荷者，僅中日兩國。在該一階段期間，我國工資成本，反較日本低廉，而產品品質，亦日見改善。故外銷　　一時，薄荷腦每年之外銷額，逾二百萬磅。彼時外銷價格，每磅約合美金九元至十元。而彼時薄荷原油收　價格，每斤約抵米一担之價。田農以利潤優厚，亦樂於　種熬煉，故產量奇　。</p>
<p>太平洋戰發，外洋來華船舶停航，薄荷腦之外銷終告停頓。於是市價一瀉千里，一斤薄荷原油抵米一担之價格比例，早已摧毀無存，農民遂相率停種。敵僞盤踞之四年中，薄荷腦所驟失外銷市塲，故各地田農雖相率停植，而國內存量尚相當充沛，供應尚不感匱乏。尤以戰後各種中小型新　廠，牙膏牙粉廠等紛紛設立，故本街之去路，反見活潑，年銷量已逐漸遞加至三萬磅以上。</p>
<p>勝利後，以外銷恢復在望，各　油又　　發動向各產區收購原油。各產區田農，亦紛紛開始種　　　料薄荷原油之市價，近來日趨下游。每斤市價不過一萬元。尚不到米二斗之價，而且前田農熬煉原油每斤所需之燃料，已扯六千元，工資亦須扯三千元，然販運商或廠商所能付給田農之代價，每斤不過八千元，故田農產油結果，反須虧耗。而販運商亦因無利可圖，不願販運。故甫將抬頭之薄荷業，又受頓挫而奄奄無生氣。</p>
<p>薄荷商品有薄荷腦及薄荷素油兩種。據業中人談：薄荷原油每市担，約可提煉薄荷腦及薄荷素油各五十磅。民國廿六年時，薄荷腦每磅約爲十五元，薄荷素油每磅約爲七元。目前市價，薄荷腦每磅約爲一萬六千元，薄荷素油每磅約爲七千元，較戰前不過漲起千倍有零。而一般物價及工資指數，均已逾五千倍。故各薄荷廠亦飽受高物價高工資及高利貸之威脅。目前開工之八九家工廠中，皆　茍延狀態中。據稱開工率遠不及戰前百分之二三十。目前各廠所用原料，尚係以前存貨。新產原料，以成本高昂，以目前薄荷腦及薄荷素油之市價言，實感無法採用，外銷方面，本市若干廠商及出口行，自勝利後即曾陸續發動。據悉戰後各國，以英國·印度·美國等對薄荷腦之需要，最爲迫切，惟目前國內一般物價高昂結果，薄荷腦在國內市價上漲之比例，雖僅千倍，然反映於國外市塲之價格，仍嫌過高。勝利後美國各進口商向我國訂購薄荷腦所開之價格，每磅不過美金四元五角。現雖陸續加至八元，惟一般廠商，仍感無法輸出，印度出價較高，每磅約合法幣一萬九千元。惟印度每筆進口貨，均須領取英國之許可進口證，故手續繁復，時間冗長。英國之出價，每磅亦達法幣一萬八千元。據估計勝利後陸續成交之外銷薄荷腦，約達六百餘箱（每箱六十磅）。成交價平均每磅自一萬六千元至一萬八千元不等。此中以裝運至英國及印度　居大宗，瑞士亦佔一小部份。視戰前之輸出額而言，已不可同日而語。</p>
<p>據業中人表示：薄荷一項，因性質單純，普通薄荷腦溶點在攝氏四十二度以上，薄荷素油濃度在五十度及六十度以上者，即頗符合出口品質之水準。故一般商人均能經營。茍政府能於此時，予以一臂助力，薄荷事業前途，必有可觀。渠等指出：消極方面，可對各薄荷廠酌放工貸，俾使各廠一面將手中存貨儘量推動外銷，一面可收買田農手中原油存貨，同時解決廠商及田農之苦悶，積極方面，應設法津貼薄荷腦之出口。據估計：按目前原油之生產成本計，薄荷腦之外銷津貼價，至少應維持至每磅五萬元之價格，方有刺激田農再生產之力量。同時希望豁免薄荷腦之出口稅，及推行進出口聯鎖制。將進口數值，以適當之比值，分配予薄荷腦之出口。則我國薄荷事業之前途，庶有豸乎。（蒼龍）</p>
<h3>鮮豬來源受阻　本市肉價上漲</h3>
<p>本市鮮豬來源，其大宗出產，向在蘇北淮陰等處，自淮陰貨因故斷絕後，江北靖江縣屬之新港口，亦爲鮮豬出口之集中地區，最近被共軍勒捐騷擾而又生阻碍，故上海到貨日告缺乏，豬肉售價，遂因之上漲，昨日據豬行商業同業公會理事長忻筱康告記者云，目前滬市之肉價，因受上述影響，故旬日之間，毛豬之市價，竟由每公斤一千三百餘元而突漲至二千四百元，肉店門市另售，每市斤需三千餘元，尚感供不應求，形勢日趨嚴重，蓋癥結之所在，不獨來源受阻，即沿途遭遇手續頻繁之軍警檢查，每以躭誤時間爲苦，且活豬裝運以迅速爲佳，茍在途中多延時日，而豬隻悶在艙內，死亡必多，損失重大，以致行販裹足，刻下呉淞　棧所到鮮豬，僅賴張黃港任家港兩處之少數豬船，到貨應市，現正在極力設法，減少阻碍，暢通來源。</p>
<h3>台糖公司鼓勵農民種蔗　已成立台幣五億元貸款</h3>
<p>按照海關戰前的進口記錄，每年最高達六十萬噸左右，台灣業公司擬在今年本月份開始種植甘蔗，十八月以後，台灣全省產糖預計可增加至卅萬噸，此項計劃達到以後，再謀逐漸擴展，該公司於事先籌劃農貨，以資鼓勵蔗農推廣種植，以增生產，並繕具　密意見書，商由台灣銀行舉行貸款台幣五億元，據可靠方面獲悉，此項貸款業已核准，其預定目標爲農民種蔗六萬甲，（每甲約合一公頃，等於十六畝）台糖公司農塲計三萬甲，每田貸款最高額爲台幣九千元，年息僅八厘價還方法在明年甘蔗成熟時，按照市價扣除，關於肥料方面，台　當局已與美國洽購中，可能在硫酸亞五萬噸（值三百萬美元）陸續運華云。</p>
<h3>北方接收鑛廠　產權處理辦法　業經統一規定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕據悉北方接收鑛廠之產權處理，殊多困難與糾紛，現經統一規定辦法，凡鑛廠主人在戰時未與敵僞合作者，待產權清出後，一律發還原主，如在淪陷期內，經敵僞強佔而增加資本者，此項增加之資本即視爲國家之股權，廠主須依照主計處所編之物價指數，折合現款，出價收買，如敵僞所增添者爲機件設備時，其價可按照時價減去折舊計算，亦須由原主價購，萬一所添之機器設備，爲數過鉅，非原主所能購買時，則使用該項機器時，須按期向政府繳納定額之租金，原則上主管機關對抗戰及復員有貢獻之工鑛，自可予優待。</p>
<h3>柏油迭見新價</h3>
<p>柏油皂用雖成尾聲，然尚有交易，惟數不巨耳，而燭淘銷塲正當其令，且天時炎威未退，所用非高貨不可，故禾本仍特別提高，產地已售開十萬元，兼之存底單薄，出新尚遙，人心難免振奮，頗有方興未艾之勢。但浙東金蘭一帶，數雖不多，而價格所加無幾，況漢口市上依然如故，因數少貨低，以製獨用塲爲大衆所取耳，以各處市　而衡，自以嘉興一帶鋒芒最健，幾無日不在加增之中，亦時令所造成也，申市付盤業已按市面定。計禾本油十一萬元，內坪油九萬八千元，獨砠油九萬六千元，　連　油九萬二千元，麻城油九萬元，稍次八萬六千元。</p>
<h3>紡建備妥成品　擬往南洋易貨　唯待政府批准</h3>
<p>棉紗出口解禁之消息，最近甚　塵上，關於此事，紡建公司曾首先向政府要求，上海紡織業繼起贊助，津市紡織業亦有同感，查南洋需要紗布甚殷，新加坡華僑商會主席連瀛洲，及暹羅華僑代表均有電到達，目下如不及時爭取南洋市塲，則最近恢復出口之日本紡織業，又將乘機佔先，據息：本月內有荷蘭商船一艘開駛，紡建公司已備妥成貨一批，擬運往爪哇等地，換購苧蔴燃料，以應紡建本身之用，此項辦法，正待政府批准，如獲許可，即爲紗布出口解禁之先聲。</p>
<h3>檢討房荒救濟辦法　現行途徑依舊走不通　房地產業之三項建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃以如何解決目前之屋荒問題，詢諸本市房地產商業同業公會某負責人。據告：目前各方爲解決屋荒問題之治本辦法，不外三種：一係由業主修理殘毀房屋。二係租借市府公地造屋。三係選擇市區適當之空地，責令原業主造屋。關於修理殘毀房屋，係因閘北南市區燬於砲火及轟炸之房屋頗多，如由業主加以修理出租，則亦可增加房屋之供應。且聞爲鼓勵業主修葺起見，該項修理後供用之房屋，其房租將不受租金標準倍數之限制，惟現查修正租賃管理規則第八條，不得預收一個月以上之租金之限制，則又將使同規則第五條形同具文。緣該條規定：被炸燬或傾圯之房屋尚可修復者，得令房主修復出租。據告：業主若以數百萬元投資修理殘毀房屋，而每月僅收租金數萬元，則月須虧蝕利息數十萬元，雖至愚者不爲，故殘毀房屋將永無修復之望。現聞房地產公會已將爲此事，具呈市府，請求對新規則予以修正。關於租借市府公地造屋一事，據聞租期十年，租期滿後，地上建築物，即歸市府所有。故爲鼓勵業主造屋起見，應予一次收取租金之便利。關於選擇市區適當空地，責令業主造屋起見，應予一次收取租金之便利。關於選擇市區適當空地，責令業主造屋一節。如原業主願意接受，而缺乏資金時，當局擬設法使獲得中央銀行低利貸款之便利。否則，亦可由房地產公會出面合作造屋，而原業主則以所屬地產，充作股份，造成後出售，以資收回造屋成本。渠稱：如市政當局能排除各種現實上之障碍，使各業主發生投資興趣，則依照上述三項辦法，逐步推進，本市屋荒問題，不難迎刃而解也。</p>
<p>又據該負責人稱：目前本市房地產業前途最大之　結，仍莫過於租賃問題。蓋以目前情形言，業主實已處於有產無權，業不自主之境地。對所屬之房地產，既無使用權，又無收益權。而業主尚須負担契稅，地捐，租賃所得稅，營利事業所得稅，印花稅，房捐等。權益既乏保障，而賦稅負担又重，故具慧眼之業中人，無不早將手持之房地產，儘量拋出。計自勝利迄今，本市一般房地產市價，蓋已平均跌支百分四十。爲重振房地產商業計，該業會具呈行政院，請求三點：（一）從速組織土地銀行，在該行未成立前，請飭四行准予承做不動產抵押貸款。（二）凡不屬土地民法範圍之各項規則條例，有碍房屋之建設修理者，儘量予以取銷。（三）房捐應歸居住人負担。</p>

<h3>蜚聲國際的外交家學者顡惠慶　七十年的體驗·只有一個主張　讀書為了救國·恬淡戰勝憂</h3>
<p>本報記者攝</p>
<p>每當夕陽西下，涼風徐來的時候，在兆豐公園裏，或者在福煦路比較淸靜的西段，我們時常會看見一位身裁頎長，銀髮滿頭的西服紳士，正在悠然漫步。有時，身旁還有一位天眞文雅的女孩子，靜靜地陪着他，愉快而寗靜。這位老紳士就是蜚聲國際的中國外交界耆宿顏駿人先生。</p>
<p>上海一向是人文薈萃的地方，而顏先生雖然籍隸上海，却是在國外消磨了不少歲月。他曾經在德國，丹麥，瑞典，美國，蘇聯，代表着中華民國，增進了國際間的友誼，更立下了不少歷史性的功績。第一次世界大戰結束之後，他是巴黎和會中我國代表團的顧問。在日內瓦，他更在國際聯盟會上盡了折衝的能事。國聯固然那年並沒有對日本採取有效的制裁，但是，中國代表團的努力是並沒有失敗的根據現在我們所看得到的那些材料，我們已經可以知道，如果常時美國國務卿史汀生和駐日大使格魯並不對日本的緩和分子（尤其是格魯的好朋友牧野和廣田）尙存僥倖之想，國聯的確是可能而且願意採取相當嚴峻的步驟的。中國代表團在當年所發表的幾篇激昂慷慨的控訴，也許就爲第二次大戰中盟那對我們的援助下了一顆種子，而領導了這次控訴的，就是顏先生。</p>
<p>在敎育界文化界方而，顏先生的功績史是不朽的。在獻身外交界之前，他已經就是清華的「總辦」（相當於現在的校長），此後，他又担任了燕京，南開，協和，聖約翰四大學的董事長。門牆桃李，眞是滿布天下！以著述而論，中華書局那部皇皇巨軼的英漢大字典，也就是顏先生的大作。</p>
<p>然而，顏先生是前淸「賜進士出身，授職翰林院檢討「的。這樣一個頭銜，在一般人心目中所引起的印象總該是「花翎補子」，手撚朝珠，脚踏粉底京靴」之類龍，而何以他竟一躍而成爲一位國際聞名的政治家，成爲中國靑年們的一位最進步的導師呢？</p>
<p>我相信，最主要的原因是：顏先生是一位學者。</p>
<p>因爲他即使在政務極忙的時候還時常手不釋卷，所以他不但對於時代精神把握得準確，而且這世界下一步將有何等演變，他也具備了精確估計的眼光。書本不但供給了「歷史」，也還提供了「趨勢」。一個能把握時代精神的政治家是不會得「老」的。</p>
<p>今年，顏先生已經是六十九歲的高年了，而平均每星期還一定至少讀完新書一册，試問，中國那些以喊口號貼標語爲罷事的前進靑年之中，有幾個是肯這樣下眞眞實實的功夫的？</p>
<p>顏先生曾提出過「讀書救國」的主張，這實在是他幾十年體騐而來，決不是故意壓低靑年們救國的情緒。事變前，我們不肯下工夫研究日本，因而在今日勝利之後，就覺得懂日本的人實在太少——如果叫我們中國人去代替麥克阿瑟元帥和他的部屬去管理日本，你想導局面會變得怎樣？現在，又有幾個人在下工夫研究蘇聯呢？興其叫一百句口號，貼一百張標語，還不如讀一本書的好。顏先生在十年前的主張，在目前這個建設開始，需材孔亟的時候，實在還是最最切中時弊的箴言。</p>
<p>當然，顏先生品格之高，操守之正，也是顏先生成功的主要因素，日寇攻陷香港的時候，他雖然喬粧難民，困頓不堪，却仍舊被日軍在九龍發現了，立刻予以逮捕，那時，林逆柏生的「中華日報」上獰惡地指示着不祥的預兆，他說：若輩除幡然悔悟參加和運以外，別無徑途可循」。在這無恥的威脅的後面，充分表示着敵僞的用心相當險惡，但是顏先生始終以恬淡戰勝了憂懼，以「威武不能屈」的精神應付着敵人堅苦卓絕地度過了四年難堪的歲月！</p>
<p>前清「賜進士出身」的「翰林檢討」不止顏先生一位，有顏先生這樣眼光和氣魄的又祇有多少？</p>
<p>顏先生是不會「老」的！</p>

<p>他沒有進過中學和大學，僅在十一歲至十四歲在廣東故鄕私塾中受了三年老式敎育。他父親是個收人極微的小商人，不能負擔他更多的敎育費，所以當他十四歲那年出了私塾，就被送進一家小百貨店裏去當學徒。困苦的學徒生活，却激發了他的求知慾，他乘晚上的空閑，進一所夜校，開始學習英文。在短短的幾個月之中，他的英文竟已相當可觀。十六歲那年，他決不再做瑣碎的學徒工作來浪費他寳貴的時間。於是禀准了父親，脫離了這所小百貨店，而進一家敎會辦的英文學校。這便是他一生中唯一的學梭生活了。但好景不常，短短的六個月後他又因故離開了學校，而他的英文基礎也就在這忙碌短促而不安定的生活中奠定了。十七歲那年，他便大胆地接受一家中學英文敎員的聘書。自從那時起，他不斷的自修其他各種學科，可以說於學無所不窺，於書無所不讀。他加入函授學校，進補習班，自然科學，社會科學，士木工程，法律，法文，德文，他都下過苦工，且皆有相當的造詣。他無論學習那一門學識必先擬定一個計劃和目的，並旦注重應用。他曾經說過：「沒有目的去求學，收效固少，有了目的去求學，而不知將來怎樣去應用，其效果仍是有限。惟先有了目的，尤其感覺需要的迫切，這樣的去求學，其成效往往是出人意外的」。這是他忠實的自白和經騐之談。這是他日後成功的不二法門。商務印書館總經理的職務，給予他一個發展抱負的好機會。他運用他的學識配合了他超人的毅力，實行了「科學管理」。一種新制度的推行，總要遭到若干困難，商務印書館實施科學管理之初，也就遭到了意外的反對，幾乎釀成風潮。這對於新任的總經理無異一個下馬威，但他却安之若素，反而收回了成命這種舉措與他平日堅强的個性絕對的不調和，致使一般人都以爲王雲五妥協了，軟化了，失敗了。但以後的事實吿訴我們：這不是他的失敗，正是他不固執和機敵之處。</p>
<p>「一二八」商務的閘北寳山路總廠遭日軍炸燬，幾陷於一蹶不振之境，王氏却以他百折不攪再接再厲的精神，在短期內復興了商務，這是他毅力的表現。他當時曾力說：「敵人把我們打倒，我們不力圖再起，這是一個怯弱者。一倒便不會翻身，適足暴露民族的弱點，自命爲文化機關尙且如此，更可爲民族之恥。」他又常說：「應付困難是最大的與越，解決困難也是最優的獎勵。」。</p>
<p>王部長在最近的全國經濟計劃委員會會議之後曾經對記者說：「我們不能徒具計劃，却一定要把計劃中的每個字都付諸實現。」過去的事實吿訴我們：他是說郵蘇，做到到，不是開空頭支票的人。又一次，他謙虛的說：「我現在正在學習新課本。」是的，他是主張「學以致用」的。那末，他今天所學習的，一定是如何改革政治上經濟上的一切因循的積習。記者在這裏虔誠祝頌他的健康，並且期待着他今後更偉大的成功！</p>
<h3>文化前驅：胡適</h3>
<p>帶着慈母的愛力，帶着用功的習慣，帶着懷疑的傾向，一步一步地踏上了文化先鋒的階梯！</p>
<p>新文化運動的開路先鋒，胡適博士，儘管有人說他官癮兒太深，但自有他歷史上的地位和學術上的功績。</p>
<p>胡適三歲時，就死了父親，如果沒有他母親的賢明敎養，他的一生恐怕很難會有今日這样煇煌的成就。</p>
<p>他母親在十七歲做新娘，二十三歲起就做了寡婦，從此以後，又過了二十三年十分苦痛的生活。她把全副希望都寄託在這唯一的骨血上。她替他爭取讀書的機會，她敎他如何做人的道理，她是他的慈母兼嚴父，又是他的恩師。當時胡適在家熟裏念書，別人家送先生的年俸是兩塊銀元，他母親却第一年就送六元，以後每年增加，最後加到十二元。這一筆增加的學金決不是白化的，相反地，這是一種目光遠大的「投資。因爲那時候私熟裏的敎學方法，都是所謂「讀死書，背死書」，先生從來不肯替學生「講書」，但是他母親却情願化了較大的學費囑託先生「每讀一字，須講一字的意思，每讀一句，須講一句的意思」。就這樣，一字一句的講解，替胡適奠定了一生學問的基礎。</p>
<p>生在上海，五歲時回到故鄕，在母親的敎訓之下住了九年，受了她極大極深的影響。常十四歲的時候，胡適就離開了安徽績溪。「孤零零的一個小孩子，所有的防身之具只是一個慈母的愛，一點點用功的習慣，和一點點懷疑的傾向」，胡適終於來到了上海。</p>
<p>在上海的六年間，他念過四個學校—梅溪學堂，澄衷學堂，中國公學，中國新公學。他是一個好學生，也可以說是一個「壞」學生，他到處名列前茅，他也曾被學校記過。他鬧過學潮，他自己也辦過學校。在這一個時期裏，像當時許多靑年一樣，梁啓超的文章給予他極大的震盪與感動。尤其是在他讀了梁先生的「中國學術思想變遷之大勢」以後，一方面佩服，一方面又覺得有殘闕，當時就存了巷梁任公補作的野心，而這一點野心就種下了日後他的巨著「中國哲學史」的種子。不過造成他日後對於新文化運動最大貢獻的提倡白話文的豐功偉績，却得歸之於在中國公學時候的一段訓練。當時他的幾個同學組織了一個競業學會，辦了一個純粹用白話寫文章的「競業旬報」，請別號鈍根的傅君劍做編輯，胡適就常常在旬報上寫稿。傅君劍送他一首詩，說是「天下英雄君與我，文章知已友兼師」，更使胡適受寵若驚而得到了不少鼓勵。「競業旬報」出了幾十期，不但給胡適一個發表思想整理思想的機會，還給了他一年多作白話文的訓練。白話文從此成了他的一種新工具。這件新工具，用他自己的話來說：「使我能够在中國文學革命的運動裏做一個開路的工人。</p>
<p>世界上難得有完人，一個成功人物的一生也不一定全走的是正路。胡適就是一個很好的例子。中國公學的一部份學生，爲了校章問題，不滿校方的措置而相約退學，另外組織了一個新中國公學。胡適也是參與其事的一份子。但是新中國公學維持了一年，由於經濟的無法繼續，終於解散。胡適的理想受了打擊，正在此時，他家庭的經濟又陷入了困境，憂愁煩悶之餘，在一班輕薄朋友的影響之下，他墮落了。打牌，喝酒，叫局，昏天黑地，無所不爲。幸而那時來了一個轉機，有一天晚上，他又在一個「堂子」裏吃花酒，喝醉了，獨目坐了一部黃包車在大雨中回去。出門上車後，竟失了知覺。第二天醒來時一看，却是睡在巡捕房的鐵　裏，身上舊皮袍已完全濕透，臉上有傷痕。一問之下，才知道昨夜酒醉後在路上打傷了巡捕，半夜裏捉進去的。這一天，胡適被釋後回到家裏，在鏡子裏看到臉上的傷痕和渾身的泥濕，他不覺悔恨交集，想起了「天生我材必有用」的時句，他想：我胡適難道從此完了嗎？</p>
<p>胡適完了嗎？不，胡適得救了。他從此摒絕酒色，一心一意的準備官費留學考試。終於得到了些朋友親戚的經濟上的賢助，以第五十五名的官費生在二十歲時候到了美國。</p>
<p>在美國，據說他最初念的是農科。大槪是一時的衝動，根本上對此並無興趣，後來研究到加里福尼亞州所產的菓實。單是種別，就不下千百，要他一一牢記學名，胡適終於覺得這不合他的個性，而幡然改絃易轍，攻讀文哲學科。他天份聰明，根基深厚，又勤勉好學，終於獲得了博士的榮銜。民國六年回國，任北京大學的敎授。這一段時期是他一生中光芒萬丈的階段。像一頭初生的猛虎，他抨擊一切舊的文化與道德，在中國社會中掀起了軒然的巨浪。他提倡白話文，寫白話詩，而最値得佩服的，還在於他那種潑刺敢爲的與舊勢力鬥爭的精神，道種精神在幾十年後的今日，固然已不再在他身上表現，但最使人傷心的還是今日一般正在所謂氣壯力盛時代的靑年，竟還缺乏這種敢作敢爲的朝氣！</p>
<p>世界不停的在變，人的思想興行動也不停的在變，隨着年齡的增加，胡適漸漸地對政治發生了興趣，他寫了「民權論集」痛駡政府，因此而失去了中國公學校長的位置，他又曾發表了五十年後抗日論調而被別人痛駡。如果胡適確實對政治有興趣，那末他在這方面又成功了。你想；四年的駐美大使，不正是一個很好的實例嗎？</p>
<p>這次，胡適回國來了，而且重回北大去了。他說此後將埋首做一個敎書匠，做一個史學家。我們也這樣地期望着他。神州茫茫，蒼生蚩蚩，新一代的「胡適」又在那裏呢？</p>

<h3>行總滬分署長劉鴻生　成功的里程碑</h3>
<p>無比的魄力，集中在劉鴻生先生的整個身心。他說幹便幹，他人所能做而不願做的，他幹。他人所不能做的，他也幹。一經開頭，必底於成。劉先生便憑着這一股子磅礡的魄力，在民二十年當了三年招商局總辦，現在他肩負起「行總」上海分署的重任。</p>
<p>這眞是一個繁重艱鉅的任務。沒有行政經費，沒有堆存救濟物資的倉庫，更得担心霉爛腐敗，可是他畢竟担任了下來。他肯負責，講究實事求是，講究做到一點是一點。他請求效率，他有日新月異的精神。他有着經營各種各樣事業的經騐。他自己大大小小的蓬勃事業，便是他成功的里程碑。</p>
<p>「我不是在做官，我只知道辦事，認爲「是」的便立即實行，認爲「錯」的便立即反對，是則是，非則非，我最痛恨敷衍因循，模棱兩可。不論成敗，不問功罪，我一定要給萬事下個確確切切的決定。當記者與劉先生的子婿輩環坐着聊天時他如此坦白直率地說。「我寗願殺頭，寗願吃官司，我一定負責」</p>
<p>生長寗波的劉鴻生先生有着一般寗波人那股不怕勞苦，自强不息的精神，他的過去的五十九年，無一時無一刻不在「動」之中消逝，無一時無一刻不在奮鬥中求進步，他的高大壯健的身材，他的緊緊與時代吻合的銳敏的思想，他的刻劃着廣大經騐的皺紋的寬潤的前額，在在顯示着歷經患離痕影。</p>
<p>劉先生的幼年與每一個成功者一樣，是在不太奢侈的環境中消磨去的。他的父親是招商局船上的職員。一個質樸的家庭當然無法供給奢華的大學敎育因此當他讀完Freshman以後，便離開了約大，自己找了個職業。</p>
<p>那是英商的開　礦務局，其時營業還未順利展開。劉先生最初是開灤的一個普通繙譯，很快的便獲得了上級的信任，後來英商便利用他的摧銷的天才與牢固的信用，跟他合組了一個開灤售品處。由於他的努力，沿長江各口岸大小工廠船隻全用上了開灤煤，營業立定了脚跟。他就以經營煤斤的盈餘創辦了平生第一個工廠：鴻生火柴公司。</p>
<p>「鴻生公司」的動總是深深感人的一幕。那時劉先生還只廿四五歲。從無錫淸名橋到宜興的張渚徐舍，這一帶的磚瓦石灰窰，全已用他的廉價的開灤煤代替了樹柴。但是，這一來却苦了當地靠樵柴爲生的山民，怒火在心頭滋長，有一天，劉先生住宿在蒲舍鎮的時候，分銷處的朋友密告他，將有千餘山民要來包圍他，企圖加以謀害。爲了免得累及朋友，他搬到了一個茶館內，一淸早，果然來了四五十個怒容滿面的農民。他們譴責他奪去了他們的生路，劉先生仗着他的慷慨靈活的手腕，機敏動人的辯才，說服了衝動着的羣衆。</p>
<p>道一幕深深的感動了他，知道一個只知獨自謀利的商人是沒有羣衆的，甚至會是大衆的仇敵。「我決心以取之於他們的，仍復用之於他們，」他說：「我選中了交通輻輳的蘇州，辦了個火柴工廠。讓老幼殘弱都可以得着生計。這就是我創辦工廠的動機」</p>
<p>五十九年來，這也就一直成了他的發剏事業的動機。新的工廠公司，像雨後春筍般成立。他曾經先後組織華東礦務公司對抗英商的開灤煤。他曾在過越南時偶然見了鴻基煤屑，便立即發明了機製煤球。（大中華煤球廠）他創辦了章華呢羢公司，中華碼頭公司，華商上海水泥公司，中國企業銀行等等。</p>
<p>劉鴻生先生的事業，全是仗着卓著可靠的信用來發動，來主持的。金融資本曾給了他一個極大的帮助。一九三〇年波及全世界的不景氣，對中國工商業是個絕大的風浪，劉先生的事業也未能例外。但是靠了他的有限私人財產的資助，雖然各工廠各公司都虧本，却始終兀立着不動。因爲他以信用向銀行界換得了現金，再以個人私產變賣了支持永遠兌現的信用。畢勛路上綠樹蓊鬱的比利時領事館，便是十餘年前支持信用的代價之一。</p>
<p>爲了要以數字證明他的信用，從民國十年起，他第一個在各行廠中應用新式會計請英國會計師克佐時洋行審查他的賬目。同時，他也是應用科學管理的第一人。（凡是新的，他都敢於嘗試）</p>
<p>一九三七年秋末，隨着我政府的內遷，他到了香港。那時，他在上海的若干事業逢到了第二個大危機，可是他絕不灰心，毫不絕望，還是以堅韌不拔的戰鬥精神，開闢新事業。他在香港與金融界友人合設大中國火柴公司，其出品竟能暢銷南洋，遠達加拿大。</p>
<p>一九三九年，敵人的魔爪更緊地抓住了上海。他不顧一切的命令在滬的四公子念智偷運四家工廠的龐大機器，經香港，海防，仰光，滇緬公路，歷盡艱險，抵達重慶。在那裏，又創辦了中國毛紡織廠，永安電池廠，建華燈泡廠，並與財部合創中國火柴原料廠，製造抗戰所急需的燐，氣酸鉀等化學品。</p>
<p>歷經了民卅大轟炸，物資匱乏，運輸艱難等厄運之後，他的事業依然穩固如常。據劉先生左右的人說：那時大後方的物資環境的困苦，非親自經歷者決難想像得到，劉先生本人爲了屋滿的原故，曾撑了雨傘睡眠哩！</p>
<p>現在，在他做過了招商局總辦，做過了火柴專賣管理局局長以後，政府終於又聘請他担負起善後的重責。最近，記者在那間高爽涼快的客室中請敎這位成功者「成功的因素究竟何在」。他一邊拆着一本新從美國寄來的Factory（工廠管理雜誌），一邊說：「Up—to—date」。他向着記者用謙遜但是嚴肅的語調說：「我還稱不上成功，自然也說不上秘訣。就是喜歡時刻不斷地學習。現在讀書人的大病，是一出校鬥，一有職業，便立刻拋掉了醫本。世界是不斷在進展，我們便應時刻求進步。」</p>

<p>改善洋涇區衛生</p>
<p>編輯先生：浦東洋涇區幅員遼闊，居民十七萬七百零八人。（本年五月民政處統計）復員以來，本區治安，敎育，財政，土地，衛生等行政，已日趨軌範。惟按目前狀况觀察，施政方面，最爲迫切重要之舉，莫過於衛生行政，爰將原由略述之。</p>
<p>本區沿浦一帶，廠棧林立，棚戶櫛比，熱鬧市集，溝渠閉塞，汚水盈盈。曠野田間，浮厝纍纍，垃圾東堆西積，蚊蠅到處飛舞。毒素糖果，不潔飲貪沿街叫賣，感有識病人，醫療無門，見無知病家，巫視穿堂入室。孕婦分娩，多數尙沿甩穩婆接生。市民遑論衛生，大都任意糟塌。日來病人愈多，死亡率愈高。因此，本區衛生敎育之宣傳，環境衛生之整頓，婦嬰衛生之提倡，醫療機構之設置，種種衛生工作，需要泊急着手者一也。</p>
<p>其次；水爲生活必須品，尤爲延佈傳染病之主腦，本區居民，飲用未經消毒之河水井水，因此，一年一度，每至夏秋，胃腸病十分猖獗，而霍亂，傷寒，赤痢瘧疾等，尤爲本區之環境病。本區水質，有賴衛生機構設法改良者二也。</p>
<p>再次，本區居民，早出夜歸，從業於浦江西岸者有萬千計，惟兩岸港口，素無往來檢疫工作，一且本區發生疫癘，傾刻有波及浦西可能。因此；洋涇區衛生行政，應與浦西諸區目爲同樣重要，則浦西各區，方積事功，斯不可忽視者三也</p>
<p>基於上述三點，本區市民，應促成洋涇區衛生行政機構迅速健全，冀以改善區內衛生，享受現代科學之必要。主政當局，明知市庫不裕，難期實現，惟或可垂念級急權宜，毅然打破艱難，書最大努力，將於不久，貫澈預定計劃，蹟大洋經區衛生事務所，開始工作。策者深以爲慮者，蓋當地缺乏容有三十人辦公之所址一所，用茲陳情公覽，尙希桑梓賢達先進，有所協力，期即改善本區公共衛生。（潘光振）</p>
<p>市衛生局來函</p>
<p>上海市衛生局來函云：前閱貴報七月二十日讀者意見欄，載有「公厠管理工人呼聲」一文，茲答復如下：査本市各公厠售紙，工人請求增價一案，本局已呈請，市府核示，一俟奉到指令，當飭淸潔所轉行知照。關於各公厠售紙工人與包商興記公司科紛一案，已令飭淸潔所妥擬管理辦法，幷按實際情形規定包價標準呈核公布各在案，即希査照披露爲荷：此致申報館，上海市衛生局啓八，一三。</p>
<p>兩度會見陳光甫　談生平事業最大轉捩點　　陳光甫先生今天在本身和事業上的造就，正是成功者的一部活的歷史。陳先生曾受過完備的敎育洗禮，處事有計劃，富毅力。見解精確，目光邃遠。不，最成功的，還是他能把他正確的人生觀，應用到他的事業上去。道一切，造成了他今天在財政金融界不拔的基礎。</p>
<p>記者爲了要曉得他畢生從事事業的一番心得，特地在最堅一張的辦公室工作時間，趕去作了兩次的訪問。他抽空接見了。記者提了許多廣泛而難於在刹那間回答問題，也竟不假思索的一一給解答了，　　　　印像，是五十年如一日。他把打開這部五十年成功奮鬥史的鑰匙，在簡短的十分鐘內，忠實地，赤誠地，遞給了記者，以便轉遞給每個已踏上與未踏上奮鬥過程中的靑年們。</p>
<p>陳先生畢生的事業太多了，這裏姑且先談他最具體的結晶品—矗立在寗波路江西路口的上海銀行，因此記者闢頭就提出了第一個問題：「陳先生畢生事業最大的轉捩點何在」？</p>
<p>陳先生說，辛亥那年，他還在汀蘇銀行任職，眼看金融圈裏，儘受着外力的支配，猛想起，要開發中國的民族資源，非鞏固中國的金融實力不可。更迫切需要的，是一個能爲民族，爲社會服務的金融機構。</p>
<p>民國四年六月二日，寗彼路上永大銀行的現址，一間二開間的店面上，驀地掛出了「上海銀行」的牌照，資本只十萬元，而且特別提倡小額儲蓄存款。當時許多人都認爲這是一種冒險，一種嘗試。可是，成竹在胸的陳先生却不這樣想，他認爲這是他計劃的初步實現。</p>
<p>跟着歲月的推移，上海銀行有計劃地向前邁進。這中間經過多少經濟顚沛，幾許金融風波，上海銀行非但始終屹立不動，信譽却蒸蒸日上，今天，上海銀行的資本膨賬到一千萬元，原行址擴展到七層全街面的巍然大廈，存款總額打破了二百七八十億元的紀錄，全國分支行曾經到過八九十單位。現正復員，又達五十餘單位，員生人數添達一千五百餘人。今天的上海銀行，顯然已經脫穎而出，站在中國現代商業銀行的最前綫。</p>
<p>陳先生却並不以今日上海銀行的業蹟自滿，他剴切地說，銀行機構膨賬，人員一再添加，這不是一種値得炫耀的成功。辦銀行事小，做人的道理事大。辦銀行最重信用，而做人最重仁義。仁字有二人合一人的涵義，這正昭示：任何見解，不能以主觀判斷一切。主要的，還得顧全到他人的見地。金融事業是一種社會事業，要社會感到需要金融事業，這金融事業方能立足。否則，壓根兒就不必談金融。</p>
<p>談到人生的旨趣，陳先生認爲該是不斷的向前邁進，不斷的創造，和不斷的學習。他說最近十五年來，去過美國四次，歐洲兩次，得到許多朋友和先進的帮助，讀了許多好的書本子，添了許多新智識，使他感到處理任何問題或事物，應抱臨空和超然的見解。尤其是硏究金融問題，不能單單以與金融界多多接觸就可了事。</p>
<p>他說他生平一大快事，就是旅行。正因爲學問無止境，他才有野心躑躅於中國和世界上每一處的名山大川，「行萬里路，讀萬卷書。」一面修養，一面做事，可以少受環境的支配。他認爲道是安排生活最好的方法。今日中國旅行社業務之發達，至少也反映陳先生平生旨趣的一般。</p>
<p>記者又不期然問起陳先生現時代的偉人中，他最景仰的是那一位。他毫不猶疑地舉出了已逝世的美國前任總統羅斯福。他說他曾前後會晤羅斯福總統四次，覺得羅斯福總統是個能寫能做的士大夫。他認爲羅斯福總統最大的成功，是他獨到的見解，卓越的才幹，使反對他或是贊同他主張的人，都願盡忠竭智地致力於共同的事業。</p>
<p>陳先生現年已經六十六歲，原籍江黨鎭江。八一三滬戰發生後，就隨政府趕到後方。曾先後充任政府幾次經濟使節，到美國折衝樽俎。得到借款。最近的一次，是前年十月，以我國首席代表的資格，出席國際通商會議。此外，在抗戰期間，最主要的職務，有財政部貿易委員會主任委員，平準基金委員會主席委員，現在除祖任上海銀行董事長外，還担任金陵大學華西大學中華職業學校校董，由央銀行常務理事，中國銀行常務董事，交通·中匯·浙江實業等銀行，永利化工公司，大生三廠，中國水泥公司，寳豐保險公司等董事，中央信託局常務監察。</p>

<h3>探察楊鎭隘口的戰局　訪黃百韜將軍　本報五日揚州訊　特約記者王公瀚</h3>
<p>隨着戰局有利的展開，此間的人心日漸　　　了起來。尤其一般流亡的難胞，更在心頭上展開了歡愉之花，逢人道着他們還鄕的希望業已可期。</p>
<p>揚邑的「縣臨參會」，爲了表示感激駐軍第二十五師擊退共軍粉碎了共軍進佔揚邑企圖的功勛，上月卅一日，特捐集出國幣十二萬元，慰勞該師之忠勇將士，並肅電該師黃師長百韜致敬。</p>
<p>久歷沙場　謀勇兼備</p>
<p>爲了表示對黃師長的敬意，同時則爲了想替一　流亡難胞，代探試探試蘇北戰局在時間性上還需要經過多少時間便可有更大的開朗；和更明確的實際的開展。昨日（四日）午後三時許正當「烈日炎炎似火炕」的時候，記者隨本報特派員杭舟兄，同赴駐紥於此間城南之二十五師師部，拜訪了連日坐鎭中軍指揮若定的黃師長。</p>
<p>事前我只知道：黃師長是位久戰沙塲出身軍校和謀勇兼備的名將；是　蔣主席所器重的一個武裝同志。事後，我始了解：黃師長還是一位一般學識都很豐富而且健談的軍人。</p>
<p>東拉西扯泛論國事</p>
<p>談話的開頭論國事，而且是黃師長先說起的。已經很明白了，黃師長是位軍人，但他對國家的政治，敎育，以至於吏治，都非常關心；即因爲關心的原故吧？他十分憂慮！他說：「共產黨對於國家民族的利害，如其再不擺在心上，而一味以黨的利益爲第一，牽制政府一切建設中國復興中國的計劃。在這個狀態下，美國就是要想帮助朋友的中國，但恐終於要認爲中國是一個扶不起的朋友；這在我們自己說便是！一個慚愧的朋友麽」！</p>
<p>接着，他解釋了中國的敎育，經濟等建設，以及各方面，都　缺乏基礎。譬如他說：很明顯的，「中國人民的教育水準比之任何強國都太囉！而教育是立國的根本」。</p>
<p>社會黑暗　民生疾苦</p>
<p>這樣，他繼續說：「整個社會又到處是黑暗重重。連救濟事業也會發生舞弊的情事。前天，難民救濟會揚州辦事處，聽說有人將二百袋麵粉準備吞沒，我獲得報吿，便跑去查，嚇得又吐出來了。我是救濟會的「「監察」人一份子，我不管什麽；再有這種情事，我一定不客氣的抓了來辦」！末了，他補說道：「難民已是十八層地獄內的苦人，竟有在這種苦人頭上想貪汚的，你們看社會的黑暗到了什麽程度」？</p>
<p>杭舟兄便問道：「那個辦事處主任可是姓謝的」？</p>
<p>黃師長這：「聽說，謝這人還好，他下面辦事人不成！」</p>
<p>杭舟兄又這：「聽說還有這麽一個現象哩，就是：一個難民會領到十多張難民證。」</p>
<p>節食放賑　難民恩公</p>
<p>「是啊！眞正的貧窮者，有時反而受不到賑濟，保甲長也有營私舞弊的。………」黃師長馬上答。</p>
<p>他們這樣談着，當時我在想起了六月份裏，當揚州的救濟機關，對揚地的流亡難胞還在調査階段中的時候，廿五師全體官兵曾實行節食數日，後來在縣公共體育塲發放食米急救難胞。再後來，社會部谷部長蒞揚施賑時，難民所裏的難胞多有趨前呼黃師長爲「恩公」者的事。以及想起了上海方面天天在爲救濟難民捐款操心的報館和許多熱心的人士。如果，新聞記者是應該宣揚美善的暴露醜惡的；或者說是有駡壞人的權利的，而我以爲捧好人也應該是一種義務。再：捧好人等於就是駡壞人的話，則我這裏的一段穿播不僅是意在捧好人，同時是意在駡壞人。</p>
<p>三百萬人總數之比</p>
<p>其次，我們談起了政府常會遭到某些報紙的指責攻擊，而共產黨反倒會有人予以諒解的一種現象。</p>
<p>我說：「這是某些剛從後方束歸的人士，不明瞭共黨與共黨的軍隊實際行爲的緣故。</p>
<p>黃師長說：「不，就是在上海，在南京，看看那些流亡的難胞，也應該知道共黨的作爲啦」！</p>
<p>從而我們又談起了蘇北三百萬流亡難胞是全蘇北一千萬人民總數字的少數的問題。</p>
<p>黃師長說：「這，據我所知，共黨最近在蘇北實行的分三畝半田給每個耕農的辦法，就並不曾獲取人們的歡迎。因此，蘇北裏下河一帶，有很多的田，反沒人肯種了。因爲：照它的規定，一季糧食的收成下來，耕糧者僅不過獲十之一二而已。</p>
<p>談到這裏，不知怎麽一來，話題被黃師長從人民的疾苦上又轉到了兵士的疾苦身上了，他道：</p>
<p>「喂，你們新聞記者要跑跑下層呀，我們的士兵你們和他們接觸過嗎？他們的生活實在太苦了，……你們要爲他們鼓吹鼓吹呀」！</p>
<p>我說：「關於士兵的疾苦，今年三月間，本報曾有「士兵呼聲」的一節文字，將士兵的疾苦叙述得很詳細透澈。這篇文字，舊時我曾把它剪下來所以記得。」</p>
<p>向前推進　奉令遵行</p>
<p>就這樣，好像是在大家第三次燃上了煙捲以後，談話終於搭上了我們的「原意」。但是，我們替難胞多少有點失望了，因爲：黃師長是這麽說</p>
<p>「南京××日報上指責我們二十五師前次進入甘泉山以後，不應該再把甘泉山放棄，又退了出來。照它的意思，我們更要向前推進才好。這，我們也知道；早一天收復許多地方，可以早一天讓難胞還鄉。但是，第一，打仗可不是搬塲住家啊？第二，向前推進是可以的，然必須得到上峯的命令。」</p>
<p>那麼，收復人人均予注意的邵伯鎭和高郵縣，依據地理的情勢說，雖然責在二十五師，但，政府一天沒有命令給它，則自然一天不要想收復了。</p>
<p>是快近五點的時間，記者和杭舟兄才吿辭了冀師長。在半途上，我初則不時地替難胞們失望，繼即我想起了軍事上秘密性的問題。同時因爲自己是，在走着路，又想起了一句俗語：「打仗不是如走路容易的。」</p>

<h3>淡裝的西子之夏</h3>
<p>— 四日杭州訊　本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>「湖上四時無不好，就由最　　花時。」</p>
<p>枕州固然沒有靑島的凉曠，不及廬山的淸幽，但是比起煩燥的上海來，杭州畢竟是天堂。挑着生活底担子的人，當然沒有福氣跑到莫干山去避暑，但是祗要抽空去一次靈隱，在參天的古木蔭下漫步或是飲若，你是有有理由可以自比作身登廬山林蔭間的。（沒有霧是一個缺點。）</p>
<p>玉泉池與西湖權充海濱浴場</p>
<p>如果你是一個夏之驕子，一個游泳的愛好者，那麼玉泉游泳池便是你底好去處，你可以和淸漣寺中玉泉池內底彩色魚互相媲美。那些不願跑遠路的朋友，則把膺白路沿岸的西湖權充海濱浴塲，在這一帶靠邊的湖底都是石子，不是那些如如前所習聞的「香灰造成的軟泥」，會把你底脚（甚至你底身體）拉進滬裏去。因此，你除了不能享受那嗅覺的海底氣味之外，你也是有理由可以把它常作海濱浴塲的。每天中午以後，不管陽光發着火一般的熱度，在那裏，便有成百的男子赤裸裸地跳進水裏去，讓軟綿綿的湖水撫摸着他們底脚底，他們底胸膛，他們底臉頰，從他們週身的每一個毛孔中，注射進西十底柔潤和淸凉，冲洗掉體內的疲勞。</p>
<p>湖上六月小泛　人間暑氣全消</p>
<p>如果你是一個愛靜的人，那麽蕩湖便是最好的「要子」。「小泛西湖六月船，船中人即水中仙」。「天堂」和「仙子」原是不開的。楊萬里的話並不過火。蘇軾早就說過：「若把西湖比西子，淡裝濃抺總相宜。」「淡裝」的夏之西子，還是楚楚可人。當夕陽西下，廻光返照得半天紅的時候，山影憧憧，水波蕩漾，大自然以一隻無形的巨手，偸偸地重下暮色的薄紗，使靜靜的湖山陡增一片神秘底彩色。僱一隻舟子，丢棄了湖濱的煩燥，到湖心，讓晚來的微風輕輕地吹拂着你底頭髮，飄動着你底衣衫，暢快地噓一口氣，你便會體味到：「人間暑氣正如炊，上了湖船便不知。」於是你就讓小舟隨着風勢飄盪着，穿過白堤，在裏西湖的荷業叢中泛舟，聽荷葉在船底刺刺地響，宛如落了一陣無形的雨。這時，明月該上升了，你盪漾在雲中月與水中月之間，隨手採一個蓮果，輕輕地剝開來，嘗一下它底淸澈的鮮嫰的滋味，「仙」的感覺，便不禁油然而生了。</p>
<p>枕州人下湖的有二種不同的方式：上面說的祗是「遊湖」，還有一種是「玩湖」。「玩」的人當然比「遊」的人來得多。從華燈初上的晚起到午夜一二點鐘止，這是玩的人最多的時候。在這幾個鐘頭之內，全湖六百艘舟子可以全部出動，以一千五百元一個鐘頭的代價，載着三三兩兩的男男女女，在湖濱公園附近隨波搖蕩，這時你一面可以借着月色看到燈影點點的湖景，一面可以看到湖濱路一帶繁華的現代物質文明。夜花園和咖啡館底擴聲器裏傳出來的爵士樂曲，隨着微風把一句句逗逗人的靡靡之音傳到遊客的耳鼓中，比起上海的舞場來，似乎是更顯出了音樂的力量。湖上還有一種賣唱的舟子，你祗要化五百元錢，便可以聽她們唱一隻你喜歡聽的歌或戲。如果你口渴，那麼水果之類，船上有的是。他們一夜可以做到十餘萬元錢的生意，比起馬路旁的攤販，他們是幸運得多了。</p>
<p>化三千元代價做半夜水上仙</p>
<p>有些特別怕熱的人喜歡在湖上過夜，在午夜二點鐘後，約了三朋四友，化三千元錢，你便可以做半夜的「水上仙」。這時划船的把櫓和槳都收歛起來，自己　在船梢打　　，　小舟在湖中順水輕盪。目前四鄕的治安雖然很成間題，但在湖上你可以放胆睡覺。詩情畫意，够你陶醉，那是不必說的了。</p>
<p>除了遊湖之外，飲茗也是避暑一法。飲茗的地方有二種：一種是普通的茶館，可以不拘細節。還有一種在山上，在沿湖的莊宅和夜花園裏，則比較「高尙」一點。杭州和蘇州一樣，同爲水鄉天堂，街上多的是茶館，杭州人不像上海人那樣忙亂，中午打一個午覺，起來摸一摸臉，就拖着鞋子，上茶館去了。祗要一壺在手，天南地北，蒼蠅宇宙，便無所不談。對於政府的物議，也都滙集於此，我覺得政府要採蒐民意，新聞記者要採訪地方新聞，這裏便是量好的處所，他們可以供給你許多材料，任你發掘。</p>
<p>雲林寺前的林蔭道上，沿着細流的山溪，設着茶座。這裏一切都是靜靜的，你可以聽到山溪的流泉潺潺作聲，樹上的鳴蟬悠悠高歌，迎着微凉的山風，飲一口淸香的龍井，你可以忘揮溽暑，完全沉醉在大自然的懷抱中了。金谷，中美，中國，幾家咖啡館，也是每天客滿，在這些地方，有歌有舞，眼和嘴是可以同時吃「冰淇淋」的。</p>
<p>市臨參會妙舉　申請恢復舞廳</p>
<p>杭州現在沒有舞廳，那些有「蓬拆」慾的人，祗好用着無聽歌來消遣。而市臨參會已經在替那些「痴男怨女」申請恢復舞廳了，他們的限制很簡單：就是不備舞女，對於臨參會的這種「出爾反爾」的態度，杭州的報紙曾有過小小的責難，但是杭州的中上等階級，是極其贊同這個提議。</p>
<p>熱浪雖然緊逼着杭州，但是不愁沒錢化的人是不會缺少避暑底勝地的。至於那些和蚊子，臭虫，臭陰溝生活在一起的人，背着生活的重祖，縱使咫尺「天堂」，也就難乎其爲「天仙」了。</p>
<h3>大好羊城不易居</h3>
<p>— 十二日廣州航訊　特派員梁風</p>
<p>廣州在復員以後，有若干地方有着長足的進步，但在一般市民的生活來說，的確是一天　比一天。做成這個局面，固然是有着很多因素，不過最重要的，還是勝利以還，生產薄弱，民生凋敝，物價騰漲不已，一般勞工以及各級人員薪俸所得，與物價上漲的速度，有如人力車與汽車賽跑，追趕不上。因而市民生活便日趨困難，社會秩序更因此而不易維持。</p>
<p>呼籲發放暹米　問題猶未解決</p>
<p>復員伊始，百物維艱，大家對「衣」的問題，似乎都已經擺在次要的位置，大家祗求有衣蔽體便已滿足，所以雖然一套普通的洋裝要八九十萬，但一般小市民可以置之不理，威脅不到他們。不過「食」的問題，却就太嚴重了！在這裏，也許有人會懷疑地問：粤省的糧荒不是已經過去了嗎？廣州的糧價不是很穩定嗎？不是還有一批批的救濟米陸續運來了嗎？是的，這些都是事實，不過問題並不在這裏，而是在大部份人根本就找不到飯吃。過去這裏一位負責糧政的當局說得最妙，他說：「並不是糧價太高，而是一般市民太窮了！』這話表面看來未免有點滑稽，但想想也是有這理的；因爲任憑米價低到怎樣，而一般市民　工作都不能解決，米價低又怎樣？所以這問題之嚴重，實由於農村經濟破產，一切工商業都受了舶來品影響而瀕於危境，失業的佔了全市三分之二，在這樣情形之下，找飯吃之難，可以想見了！最近，當局還有一個措施，是使一般貧苦市民感到最大打擊的，就是市政當局爲了整飭市容，一律不准小販在街邊擺攤。在當局的意思，當然是爲了交通秩序等種種問題才會有這措施，但他却祗有消極的制裁，而無積極的救濟辦法，又沒有一個公共市塲之類的設置，就斷然禁止他們擺賣，致把這班廣大的小販羣，趕上了生活恐慌的危境；因而失業待救濟的貧苦市民，便更一天比一天多起來了！</p>
<p>至於救濟米嗎？根據八月七日廣東善後救濟審議委員會席上，暹米監賑團副團長利華輝的報吿：第一批暹米四萬餘包以至第五批四萬餘包均已先後運抵省垣。這誠然是個好消息；同時又根據儲運處長馬開衍的報吿：七月廿八日至八月三日止，倉米存三千四百六十八包，等於一百四十餘噸，收入二萬二千七百餘噸，發出二萬零五百餘噸，倉耗一百三十餘噸……根據後者的報吿，倉耗竟達一百餘噸，已足使人震驚的了，而且正在鬧着饑荒的目前狀態，而存在倉裏的三千餘包暹米，還不及時散賑，這眞是使人費解了！所以目前一致的呼籲，要立即發放暹米，使貧民早些受惠，不過呼籲儘管呼籲，發放不發放還待下回分解，反正現在雖然馬路上餓莩日凡數十，但日子久了，大家都似乎司空見慣，再也不會獨目驚心的了！</p>
<p>房租貴得驚人　還索批頭鞋金</p>
<p>談到「住」的問題，也是相當嚴重的。原因是廣州經過淪陷以後，房屋被敵僞破壞的竟達十分之三四，而本市人口則一天比一天增加，現在已達一百二十萬有奇；據估訂：現有民房舖戶約十萬間，其中商店約佔其半，平均每間房子能住七八人，亦不過能容七八十萬人而已；所以在這樣房屋恐慌情形之下，房東們便把房子認爲奇貨可居了！，的確，展州現在無家可歸而露宿街頭的，觸目皆是。就算你付得出租錢，而想找一個房子來住，也實在是一件極不容易的事；縱使給你經過千辛萬苦找到一間，房租貴得驚人那不必說了，照廣州目前租房子的惡例，在頭一個月除了上期租之外，還要什麼批頭，鞋金，介紹費，按金等一連串，總之在頭一個月，你要交足照租額附加四五倍，才能遷入去住；假定房租每月五萬元，那你便要繳納二十至二十五萬才能住頭一個月，還有房捐警費街坊用費等未算在內哩！這還不算，更有些沒良心的房東，他給你住不到三個月，他便借着不成理由的理由，例如說他的家人從鄕間要來了，或者說他的房子要賣了，　樣扯三拉四，務必要你搬去爲止；因爲房子是那末値錢，你一走了，說不定一個鐘頭之後，便有一個新住客來補上，而房東們又大可以照收批頭，鞋金之類的一大筆費用了！</p>
<p>路政破爛不堪　晚間少出爲佳</p>
<p>再說到「行」的方面；光復以後，市外的交通，因爲幾條重要鐵路和公路幹綫均已恢復，航空的路綫和班期也逐漸增多，海運雖未全部復員，而總算勉可應付，所以還不成大問題。可是在市內，却就有行亦不易之感了！第二，廣州馬路之爛，恐怕是全世界都市所沒有的；，無論最熱鬧的地區也好，或是最僻靜的地區也好，無一馬路不是這裏缺一幅，便是那裏壞一塊：無論你坐黃包車也好，公共汽車也好，不顚得你的屁股發酸不止！第三，由於治安的不良，常常在光天化日之下，發生攔途截搶的事情，所以走在路上，就是你有一枝自來水筆或者一隻手錶，都得提心吊膽：到了晚上，那你就更「少出爲佳」了！</p>
<p>總之，如果要知道廣州目前一般市民的生活，簡單可以答復的，祗有一佩「難」字。在這生活如是困難之下，社會秩序日形混亂，那屬必然的：所以廣州的市民，尤其是貧苦大衆，無一不殷股的期望着，當局能够儘速設法替他們解決目前一切的困難哩。</p>

<h3>每星期一出版　工人暑期學校</h3>
<p>— 美新</p>
<p>各業工人得用假期進修　課目注重勞工問題知識</p>
<p>全美國的許多勞工，今年，以學生的姿態在許多學校和講習班中度過暑假，他們。一方面接受敎育，一方面獲得娛樂。</p>
<p>賓夕凡尼亞州的一個鋼鐵工人，可以將他兩週的暑假消磨在賓夕凡尼亞州立大學所辦的夏令營中，中西部的汽車工人則可在密西根產業職工大會地方分會主辦的暑假學校中進修。這個學校的範圍有二百畝，附近有赫隆湖，開學日期是八月四號，校址距離底特律城大約有六十哩，南部的紡織工人則可以到北卡羅林那縣立大學去消磨他的暑假。</p>
<p>美國各種工業中的勞工，都可以利用這一般假期來參加勞工夏令營或者研究工會高級職員，政府勞工局官員，大學敎授等所設置的課程。這些課程並將包括勞資調解程序和訂立合同協商法，勞工大會法規，世界大事，勞工史等等。關於工業管理方面，參加的學生可以學習生產程序，價格問題以及資本家所可遭遇的問題。</p>
<p>兩種系統</p>
<p>這一種兩星期的短期學程，其設置共有兩種系統，一種是工會羅辦的夏令營，一種是勞工學校，第一種夏令營是由各地工會分別舉辦，所研究的問題，也主要以當地工會會員的問題爲限。勞工學校範圍較廣，除了勞工問題以外，並有文化的科目，而且學生的來源，除了有組織的勞工以外，另外還包括未曾參加工會的工人，甚至對於勞工問題感覺興趣的大學生。</p>
<p>由於經常有大批的人都希望得到入學和受訓機會，所以最先的機會不得不留給工會的領袖。此外，願意擔任這種敎育團體的敎師也非常之多，許多敎師都在等待聘請的機會，他們都認爲勞工階級的團體是個很好的敎育實騐對象，因爲這些勞工們都有極其豐富的實際經騐而祇有很少的理論修養。</p>
<p>四個學校</p>
<p>全美國有四個勞工學校：紐約州海德公園對面的赫德遜鞋工學校，馬迪遜城威斯康辛大學所設的工人學校，田納西州蒙特依格城赫蘭德平民學校，和伊利諾州森林湖大學的職工暑期學校。</p>
<p>在這四個學校之中，赫德遜鞋工學校算是最老的一個，今年已經有廿五年歷史，最初是女工的暑期學校，後來才改成男女同校，道個學校的宗旨是使男女工人明白他們自身的問題，所以敎育家們便替這個學校訂下了課程表：包括經濟學，英語演講術，戲劇。此外另有一個工廠，以使工人們可以硏究最切身的問題。學校的大計由一個董事會督導，董事是敎師，以往的學生以及勞工團體所選出的代表。</p>
<p>威斯康辛的勞工學校在六月初開課，到八月中結束。這是惟一由州方支持的勞工學校，一九二五年學生不過三十四名，一九四五年則已增加到五百四十五名，其中有來自各州與加拿大的學生，平均年齡爲三十九歲。這個學校的主要目的，是使營工們能够集體地和雇主交涉一切。該校工作主要分三部份：最主要的部份當然是暑期學生，其次便是冬季的學校和服務工作。</p>
<p>集募資金</p>
<p>田納西州蒙特格城的赫蘭德平民學校，現在常吸引南方諸州的勞工前來攻讀。該校自一九四五年起發動了一個集募七萬美元爲基金的運動，以便容納更多的學生，增加敎師人數及設備。</p>
<p>職工暑假學校的學生包括工會職員與非工會職員，該校上課日期爲七月十三至廿七日。這個學校原於一九三三年由俄亥俄州奧伯林大學所發起，此後每年都假借某一大學的校舍舉辦，但所選地方多在中西部。</p>
<p>但是，這些暑假學校並非僅有工作而毫無游樂。大多數的暑期學校和訓練班都有安排良好的娛樂節目。舉個例說，賓夕凡尼亞州鋼鐵工人的夏令營就規定有：「下午的時間可以打高爾夫球·網球·手球·壘球以及野餐，營旁有一條養有鮭魚的小河，所以也可以釣魚爲樂」。</p>
<p>每一個參加夏令營的人，每星期大約消費二十五元，這個數目包括食住，有些暑期講習班每人收學費十元至十五元，這學費往往是由他所屬的工會代繳了。</p>
<p>這些暑期學校不過是美國勞工敎育的一部份情形，美國勞工敎育現在已於全國展開，其目的在求適應時勢，使地位日趨重要的勞工界，其領袖與會員皆能受有良好的技術訓練，而足以解決勞工問題。</p>
<p>勞資關係</p>
<p>勞資關係今日已經被列入七十五個美國大學的學程，著名的哈佛，康納爾，支加哥大學以及威斯康辛，羅德島，密昔根，北卡羅林那諸州的州立大學中都敎授這門功課。諸多敎授時常前往勞工會塲，參加勞工集會，同時則講授有關工人生活的問題。敎授通過這種關係接觸了大量的工人。</p>
<p>舊金山有一個加州勞工學校，專門訓練學生擔任勞工領袖，（另一個同樣的學校在落杉磯）這個學校不但在勞工運動中佔着很高的位置，而且在學術上也極負聲望，許多著名大學如加州大學和士舟佛大學都曾一致讚美。</p>
<p>這許多不同的勞工敎育機構，證明一般人都承認勞工必需享有代價低廉的受敎機會，不論是有工會或是無組織的勞工都應當和農業與商業界同樣享用敎育的設備。</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>有許多有本領的工程師，能够用簡省的機器，使貨品製造出來仍舊合乎最高的標準，這就是這些工程師的本領也是他們能够利用他們的學識的一種表現。</p>
<p>B．對於機械設備的關係：每一稱貨品需要每一種不同的機器，在設計貨品的時候，就要顧到這一點，在最初問世，應該是幾種不同的貨品，（少數的）因爲貨品的種類多後，公司方面是否能够有充分的資力去應付機器的設置，是値得加以考慮的。</p>
<p>有時候做一種貨品，可以利用同一的機器，或者略爲增加一點設備，所費無幾，就可以有一種副產品，不同的出品，所以貨品對機械設備，關係非常密切，在設計貨品的時候，應常顧到。</p>
<p>C．機器的持久問題：一個廠家成立之後，不能時常購買機器，因此在購買機器的時候，也要顧到一架機器能够用多少年。或者製造一種貨品，有幾種不同的方法，用甲種方法，所需的機器可以用十年，用乙種方法，所需的機器祗能用五年，那末自然以採取甲種方法爲宜，這一點是應該加以考慮的。</p>
<p>D．使銷行的時期較長：有許多貨品祗能銷幾年，幾年之後，就要有新的式樣，否則，就要落伍，所以應該選擇銷行能够持久的貨品，那末所化的設備的代價，和廣吿的費用，都不致虛費，而且從創辦事業的立塲說，也是要求其久遠的，如僅在一時獲取利益，做一點投機事業，那末自然又常別論了。</p>
<p>E．包裝運輸的關係：在設計貨品的時候，要顧到包裝和運輸的問題，譬如說一種貨品每瓶裝一兩，每箱裝十二打是最爲便利而經濟，那末不要把每瓶的份量改爲兩半，使包裝運輸感覺不便，又如香烟大都是十支，廿支，或是五十支裝，決沒有一個廠家會裝三十支或四十支裝的香烟的，一則打破了向來的習慣，不易銷售，二則包裝運輸也不便利。</p>
<p>乙·機器的裝置</p>
<p>在貨品設計完成以後，就要購買機器，在機器購到以後，就要裝置起來，在裝置的時候，就需要顧到下列幾點：</p>
<p>A必須堅牢：有許多笨重的機器，那末要做底脚，埋在水門汀裏，使牠十分堅牢，不能搖動，若不把機器堅牢地裝置，那末大則發生意外，小則時常損壞，所以是要絕對地愼重的。</p>
<p>B必須安全：辦理工廠「安全第一」這一句話很値得採用的，因爲在工廠裏發生了意外的時候，就要發生機器的損壞，或人工的傷亡或是房屋的遭難，或是原料或製成品的損失，諸如馬達·電錢·汽鍋等設備，在裝置的時候，必需顧到安全問題。</p>
<p>C必須順利：機器的設置，必須使工作可以順利進行，決不能忽而東，忽而西，忽而上，忽而下，使工作不能按着次序進行，因爲在製迭的過程中，不能順利的結果就是耗費人工，損失時期和在製造中的原料或半製成品。</p>
<p>D必須寬暢：在機器的四周，必須有寬暢的地位，使工人可以往來走動，拿了原料之後，不致於碰到機器。（未完）</p>

<p>孟子道性善，荀子却與他相反而倡性惡，性善性惡，打了幾千年的筆墨官司，究竟是怎樣一回事呢？全世界已經受了兩次大流血的教訓，應該可以覺悟了，教育家負着改造人類心理，創造世界真正和平的偉大使命，可是在野心的國家，教育却成為製造戰爭的工具，五十年來的日本小學教育，是怎樣辦的，他們是一貫的提倡侵略思想，教師手裏拿了一個蘋果，對學生說：「這蘋果是多麽美麗而甜味呀，是那裏來的，告訴你們，是從中國山東半島的烟台來的，你們愛吃嗎？你們長大快到中國去。」平心而論，日本半世紀來，培養自然科學教育，可說是成功的，可是他對於東方歷史背景，和哲學思想，却是糢糊曲解，走入歧途，一失足成千古恨。孔子說：「己欲立而立人，已欲達而達人，」「毋求生以害人，有殺身以成仁。」這本是中國哲人的崇高理想，但是日本人却未嘗夢見。教育家正如一個管理染缸的工人，做石膏模型的工匠，染成蒼則蒼，染成黃則黃，可以製成一個人像，也可以塑成一個獸形，一塊石頭，到了米啟朗格羅和羅丹的手裏，可以成為一件極名貴的美術品，供千萬人欣賞，一張白紙，在李思訓王維的腕底，能寫出雲烟浩渺，長江萬里的空前傑作，幾枝梅花，一束殘菊，算了什麽，在林逋和陶潛的眼裏，看出了自然偉大的生命，和象徵心靈的恬澹，祟高的人格。</p>
<p>人決不只是兩只臂膀，一架造糞機器，他是另具一種普通動物所沒有的性靈的生活，美國人一貫歷史性的瞧不起黑人，但是解放了黑奴，激起南北美戰爭的林背總統，他畢竟是一代偉人，雖然黑種人一般文化程度進步的遲緩，或不及其他民族，但是他們在音樂上的造詣，却已表現着極大的天才，近來美國最流行的歌舞，處處是模仿黑人的作風，作者前在巴黎一家劇院，看過一次黑女明星，若瑟芬貝克的歌舞，賣座的盛况，打破最高的紀錄，我們航行印度洋，登陸錫蘭島，一眼看到一羣印度人，席地而坐，拿手指吃飯的習慣，似乎覺得不大順眼，可是等我們遊覽印度名城，巡禮各大寺院，看到雕刻的精工，壁畫的瑰麗，又證明了印度人在藝術上確有偉大的成就，而中國在漢魏六朝時期，在文化上，確是受過印度極大的影響，在佛教的思想上，我們可以看出印度人是一個具有超越的人生觀，和智慧的偉大民族！</p>
<p>伯格遜說：「他種生物主要的，是憑本能支配生活，而人類則賴智慧來支配生活。」人的一生，不外意志與感情的活動，意志之發揚感情之推動，是導源於人格的陶養，故人類能擺脫本能的支配，而有向上創造的精神，人類崇尚的德性，為真·善·美·即孟子倡導的性善，真的反面是虛偽，善的反而是卑劣，美的反面是　惡，即所謂性惡，欲除惡崇善，則賴美惑教育的陶冶，因為美育有兩種特質，一為普遍性，一為超脫性，大自然創造的名山大川，人人得而遊覽，夕陽明月，人人均能欣賞，一幕喜劇，人人看了，哈哈大笑。一曲悲歌，令人下淚，因為美感能撕破人我狹隘的偏見，給予人類以同情，透過利害的觀念，這是美具有普遍性的明證。</p>
<p>幽囚受辱的文天祥，坐在牢監裏，產生了正氣歌，發抒他對宇宙人生的偉大抱負，身居陋巷的顏回，窮困得不成樣子，「人不堪其憂，回也不減其樂。」他能傳孔子之大道，行乞一生的武訓，他能開創一條平民教育的大路，同情農民疾苦的托爾斯泰，　　貴族的尊榮，熱愛自然，而躬耕　畝。</p>
<p>以上種種史實，證明了這種超越利害的美感，偉大而高尚的行為，有「富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈」的氣概，這是美的人生，也是人生的偉大價值。</p>
<p>中國古代教育，在二千年以前，　開始提倡美育與體育，以禮·樂·射·御·書·數·為六藝，除數外，均含有藝術成分，禮的本義是守規則，揖讓進退，「周旋中規，折旋中矩。」樂為純粹的藝術，射御在求藝術的訓練，屬於體育的範圍，書以記事，亦係藝術的另一部門，其後如漢魏的文苑，南北朝的雕刻，唐代的詩，五代以後的詞，宋代的繪畫，元以後的小說戲曲，各隨一代的文化而繁榮滋長，就教育而論，必藉藝術的陶冶，灌輸精神上的活力，然後方有內容豐富而和諧的生活，但不幸自漢以後，教育制度，由六藝而代以六經，六經雖屬聖哲之遺教，但專讀六經，則為書本的知識，而與生活教育脫罪，其結果流於章句之學，進而又以科舉取士，八股成為專業，一般人但知吚唔咕嘩，咬文嚼字，造成千年來，中國民族萎靡頹敗之風。</p>
<p>美感教育，是以培養美的人生觀做目的，希望造成普遍性真善美的活人，消滅人間一切的險詐，貪婪，殘酷，鬥爭之卑劣行為，以發揮人類崇高的美感，現在全人類正在研討如何鞏因世界真正的和平，那麽以美育培養美的人生，應當是一條走向世界和平的大道！</p>

<h3>藝術與國民生活</h3>
<p>— 黃涵秋譯。Takamura著</p>
<p>譯者按是篇發表在我國勝利之前，所談極中肯綮，可作他山之石，任何一國，均可借鏡、尤其是我國勝利之後，還在美中不足時代，豈可忽略全民族發展之重心所在。</p>
<p>不必說現在是從未曾有的時期。為了要達到完成我們民族的使命，我們民族是在貽着命運的時候，但我們要決定地不能不完成這使命，比任何事情來得重要。因此，譬如有任何事情發生，國民全部不得不協力一心而進行。先把這點深深地放入心中，而一切的事情就從這點出發而加以考慮的。這就是引導國民之道。國民全部若不能協力一心進行的時候，則最河怖的是什麽呢？那就是從國民生活上因非常時的困難而　起人心的荒廢。——就是人心的凄涼。這次戰爭已經過了多年，生活物資的缺乏是當然的事，在我國完全是初次受到的經騐，這生活上的窮苦困難，相當地給與人心以種種影響，這是事實。戰爭即使勝利，為了後方人心的荒廢而跌倒的，在第一次歐洲大戰也不乏其例。所以再沒有像人心凄涼那樣的可怖了。那因為看不見前後的界綫。到枯極的時候只有憑於破滅的一途。人的心對終僅僅講理由是不能動的，若沒有從內面發生的滋潤與光明，人的心便不為自動的工作。我以為當此非常時期所以要重視藝術這樣的問題是根據了這點。談起藝術，在許多人說起來，只要擔憂着每日吃的東西，何必斤斤於藝術那樣的事，話雖如此，但那是完全誤解了藝術的證據。有許多人當作藝術好像是奢侈品如書畫古董的鑑賞啦，住宅樣式及裝飾的考案啦，服裝的美化啦，光是想到這種東西。然而錯了。那種東西不必說是藝術的一部門，在我今日特別要鄭重提出而說的，是原來的根本問題。那就是心的問題。藝術的心，鑿衛心，或叫做藝術精神等，原來是存在於任何人的心中的一種能力，這從內面給與人們以一種欲說而說不出的滋潤與光明，而使人們常青青地有生命地生活着。</p>
<p>科學的心</p>
<p>近來，有人提倡我們國人的一般生活上所缺少的科學精神最重要的並非各色各種的科學知識，而是科學的心。而且所謂科學的心者，可以說是從概觀物象及仔細觀察物體開始，無論如何，這是根本的考慮方法。同樣在藝術方面，不是僅僅買買繪畫，穿穿漂亮衣服，而是把藝術的心，藝術心，藝術精神歸我所有之謂。那末什麽叫做藝術精神呢？先是咀嚼物味的心。就是愛物的心，不以粗暴對物的心，從物中發見其優點的心等。從出神地對於物之吟味而自己得到的醍醐味（美味），即是藝術的開始，不論就任何生活裏面，要發見牠的優點，創造出其美，探求出其意義，因而從那裏得到關於生活方面的心的沈靜，滋潤，光明，說藝術精神，同於宗教，是救助人們的。但與宗教的方法不同。宗教為除去人生的痛苦。痛的變成不痛。熱的變成不熱。甚言之，火也可以當做涼的，有這種驚人之力。藝術精神未必一定為除去人生的痛苦。但因為吟味那痛苦，一方面固以痛苦為痛苦，一何地方感到痛苦，為了那痛苦而有不屈服的力，這是藝術精神所給與的。生活安樂的人不使墮於遊惰，生活貧窮的人不使頻於絕望，便是藝術精神的表現。住於貧民小窟中，或住於狹小的亭子間內，在那裏都可以看做壼中之天地者，是有藝術精神的人。那種人若到高大的花園洋房去住，在那裏亦有壼中之天地，那種人若做了大實業家，那裏亦有壼中之天地，一旦世界的政治在握，那裏亦有壺中之天地，即於任何時候不為境遇所左右，不為事情所迷惑，不徼倖於我利我執，無論何時可以保持心的沈靜，滋潤與光明。所謂藝術精神者，就是這樣的精神。</p>
<p>藝術精神</p>
<p>原來人們總有多少那種吟味物的藝術精神，從縱觀我國古來的文學藝術之類，考及一般國民的生活，便可明瞭我們的祖先，關於物之吟味，物之愛護，不肯粗暴處理，保有生活的滋潤，不失了壼中天地所發生的光明，而不斷地踏着生成發展之路而來的。這種精神給與民族以風格和品位，以及高雅的興趣。所以我們總要想使國民性格高於他國，以便推廣電稱性格到全人類裏面。維新以來，歐美的物質文明輸入過急，這種性格有呈混亂之狀。美的標準亦有失其常態。因此，原來豐富的本國的藝術精神在一般國民心中理沒了，連把自己所有的變為無關心狀態，而成如今日的現狀。到處看到，為了利益主義，不論什麽草率地，不論什麽不親暱地，不論什麽成為沒有愛的狀態了。國民的心中簡直是缺少了餘暇，說什麽咀嚼物味之心等等，好像是迂關而不合時宜的。但是，那就不能繼續了。那就不能發展民族了。在今日之下的非常狀態，若不努力於急謀藝術精神的覺醒，則國民生活的一般的荒寂，也許是難免的。這是非常而重大的事情。幸而近來當局者有鑑於文化之重要性，而設立了文化部，使用了最適任的人們，我們得以稍展愁眉。要使國民一般的藝術精神覺醒的方法，不得不採取一切有效的手段。別的文化方面我暫且不說，關於藝術的問題，總而言之，不得不先行打破好像藝術與國民生活沒有什麽關係的這種先入觀念。</p>
<p>身邊東西</p>
<p>要之，藝術是接近在國民身邊的東西，不得不使其感到是在國民生活自體裏面的東西。任何說法，藝術作品因為是藝術精神的具體化的東西，使國民感到這種興味是容易的事。把好的藝術常常有接觸於國民的眼的機會，即，注意於一切的公共建築，使一般國民自然地發出讚嘆的聲音，便是一種方法。在這一點提倡的有所謂國民共同住居問題等，因為直接的影響很大，是十分值得檢討的。凡從來接觸於眼而有害於國民的美意識的一切東西；例如廣告，招牌，街路綫等帶有惡俗的分子，應加以改良，亦是一種方法。在老式家宅尚有存在的時候，則客堂中藝術裝飾的進步，不得不加以獎勵。今後更本於與大眾共觀瞻，與大眾共欣賞之意義的值得紀念的藝術，大大地加以興盛，以祈造成國民的美意的藝術的心。在從來已建設着的方面，凡有書於風致的，在現在亦不得不就其原址，加以老慮，商量一辦法。因為目下國民全體的問題，比個人問題來得重要。好比展覽會：以往情形，單從事於好像藝術家的競技場，登龍門等榮　之路，亦不得不加以考慮而改正，並且，只要安置重點於國民的美的祭典的性質而開設，則自然合理了。</p>
<p>又東京有帝室博物館，大倉集古館，最近又設根津美術館，利用這種來增加市民的興味，還須要採取某種方法而施行之。就像倫敦完全是商業都市，但美術館的利用是十分發達的。藝術精神是要和宗教與科學携手來支持國民，以得到發展民族之力。尤其是現在，是國民極需要藝術的時期，所以鄭重提出，不置　喋喋以完我的話。</p>
<h3>名畫與名家</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>多才多藝的文西及其代表作</p>
<p>文西是義大利佛羅蘭斯近安波里的文西村，自幼不知父母不明姓名的私生子，村人就以村名呼之為「文西」（Leonaardo　deVidci）他之所以學畫，據說是他的父觀的知友彫刻家范羅克約（Verrocclrio　1435—1488）所教授的。他的父親究竟叫什麽各字，范氏終不肯告訴人，祇說他是一個有名的大法律家。文西天稟之才，幾年後竟告大成，凌駕乃師，青出於藍終於成為世界偉人中之傑出者。</p>
<p>他是有數的技術家，架橋，築城，凡一切工程事業都經他造成非凡的成績。</p>
<p>他也是彫刻家，也製作了不少的精美的雕刻。他又是科學家，曾發明了許多科學，飛機，汽車，以及許多兵器都經他精確的設計過，對於世界學術上供獻甚夥。他更是著作家，並且還是個詩人與天文家。然而除以上各部門之成績驚人外，如今以名聞世的就是繪畫，他的畫，在美術史上佔着極光輝燦爛的地位。</p>
<p>他平生之代表作有「莫那麗沙」（永遠的微笑），「最後之晚餐」等。關於製作「最後之晚餐」時曾有許多有趣的揷話。</p>
<p>據說「最後之晚餐」是聖瑪麗寺院所委託他畫的壁畫。當製作開始的時候是非常順利的，每天日以繼夜的不斷的工作，有時竟連飲食都忘却了的沉醉在構思中。既後，因為畫中的「耶穌」相與「猶太」相煞費了腦筋，都畫不滿意，所以拖延了兩年，經僧侶們再四的催促，文西受不了這樣的打擊，終於在大怒之下向一個來逼迫他的僧侶說道：「以後可以請你不要再來逼迫了，明天我一定交卷。」到了次日果然全部完成。當那寺院的主持人發現了所畫的「猶太」的相貌與本寺的一個僧侶相像時，問文西道：「這是什麽意思，難道此人將來就是猶太一類的人嗎：」文西點頭說，我這張畫之所以拖延兩年，就是因儒我從小沒有看見過如猶太性格的人，今貴院某僧每日對我逼迫，大有釘我於十字架上之勢，故假其容貌入畫以代猶太耳」。不幾年，該寺院主持者果為該僧所害，臨死猶對人說起此事，並讚揚文西有先知之明云。</p>
<p>一五一九歿，享年約五十七八歲。被稱義大利三傑之一。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「假使您所顧慮的祇有道一點。我可以給您貢獻兩個意見：第一，戀愛並不是一個可怕的東西，除非這個男或這個女，真不懂愛情，把肉慾當了愛情。我念過沙士比亞的一句詩：「希望是戀人的手杖，把握着牠，可以幫助步履，揮舞起來，可以抗拒消沈的意志。」古君，我們不是有一個共同的目標麽？退一萬步說，即使我們認真互相戀愛起來，這點戀愛，豈不就是我們共有的一只「手杖」嗎？</p>
<p>「再者，我仔細觀察國際上的情勢，眼見那無情的大混亂，已經來臨了！像您我這樣的身世，這樣的心緒，還能偷出工夫來談愛說情嗎？縱或有互相愛慕的意思，或是片面的敬仰，充其量，也不過一種精神上的繫托，祇於是「心心相印」罷了。</p>
<p>「古君，您的閱歷見識，比我廣大得不知多少倍，您看我這設想的兩點，還能站得住嗎？若然，您也就不必害怕跟我見面了。」</p>
<p>我剛念到這裏，忽然聽見櫥櫃裏發出沙沙的聲響，我同鶴兒，同時跑到坑頭邊。開了櫥門，我　上了耳機，抓起了話筒，聽見裏面是瀋陽總站叫的號碼。我同對方，對正了雙方的秘碼後，聽得對方報出「一五四……一四……。」這是我們特殊號碼，表示下面是一串我們私有密碼。我聽了這特殊密碼，即對鶴兒打了一個手勢，他立刻端整了筆和紙，我們的通訊工作，也就立刻動手。</p>
<p>對方報完特殊秘碼之後，我接過鶴兒的記錄來，照例複報一回，免得記錄錯誤。複報完畢，鶴兒早把一本小冊子放在桌上，細心翻譯起來。</p>
<p>這本小冊子，總共祇有一千四百五十個常用的漢字：每行十個字，每而十行，所以一共祇有七八葉，照格式看，頗像一本小型字帖，字句的排列，好像一首長歌，不過有的地方不大通順。這裏面却有三種機巧，要是不經訓練，無論如何，無法使用。</p>
<p>這三種機巧，都是無機式參合有機式，譬如頁碼和字的次序數目，是無機式；但按畫夜四個六小時，分成四種變化，與一年五十二個星期的輪轉，又起一種變化。所以每個星期都有不同的　譯方式。遇有必要，發電的人，可以隨時顛倒四季，那麽，星期的秩序，也因之改動了。</p>
<p>有機式中變化得最利害的一點，就是收訊方面，可以臨時要求改變秘碼的報出秩序：譬如這篇秘碼報告，共有一百五十五個字，收訊的人，首先問明了全文字數，然後把全文次第，顛倒錯亂一下，由收方指定一個某數的字，發方就把那個字說出。這一着，是預防在某一個短時期內，疑惑同人中，有人偷收秘碼，出賣消息的辦法。因為德國這部無綫電話機，造得極其靈妙，只要距離改變，週率也就改變。那就是說，如若收發兩方對了週率，被此就可以通話。假設第三者也收到發方這個週率，却只能聽到發方的聲音，絕不能同時也把收方的聲音聽到；因為第三者的地點，不能恰好是在雙方距離相等的中心地點；如此，縱令第三者收到這通電訊，也不過一篇亂七八糟的糊塗賬，簡直無從探繹。</p>
<p>萬一通訊站把這本小冊失去了，又怎麽辦呢？那可以說毫無關係；普通人祇當牠一本字帖，間諜偷去了，因為有機鑾化太多，也無從應用。仝人假若遺失了，立刻就得報告。可是十來年中，當管電站的同志們，就把這東西富貴得同自己性命一般，遺失的事，從來不曾發生過，只有幾次是自己消毀的。</p>

<p>報載漢口市發生離奇大騙局，有老嫗張馮氏，以標會方式，邀集商家婦女組織標會團，大小達一千七百餘個，吸收法幣逾十三億元，氏即以此盤剝重利，儼如一大富翁。</p>
<p>爲救濟蘇北難民而發起的選舉上海小姐，發動了那末多的人，報紙天天在鼓吹，還將有大規模的園遊會，目標也不過是二十億元。</p>
<p>在此一對照之下，益信惡事易做，善舉難辦也。</p>
<p>一個朋友，原是公務人員，勝利以後將家眷送回了收復的家鄉，另一個朋友開創出口商行拉他到上海帮忙，並說：「八年來你堅守崗位，也可問心無愧了。現在算帮我的忙，也讓你自己伸下腰吧。」朋友允了。想不到大半年來，祇見一批批洋貨的進口，出口簡直是停滯了，朋友弄得啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>現在出口貨的關稅已吿免除，祝福我的朋友眞能伸下腰吧。</p>

<h3>何處市中心</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>最近，公用局趙局長招待記者時，報吿當局決定於九月一日起，實行市中心區交通管制辦法，並且加了一個註脚，所謂市中心區，係指黃浦灘以西，西藏路以東，中正東路以北，蘇州河以南之區域。因了這一個註脚，便不禁生了一個疑問，究竟何處是市中心區。</p>
<p>我們大家知道，上海是有一個市中心區的。那是在戰前，我國政府因爲租界尙未收回，自力更生耗費不少人力物力而築成的。那處房屋的美輪美奐，馬路之齊整平坦，大家都曾寄以讚美。不幸，工程雖已完成，發展尙未健全的時候，戰火突起，市中心區當然遭受了不可免的命運。</p>
<p>不過，市中心區當然依然是市中心區。</p>
<p>勝利以後，租界已經取消了，市府的辦公地址，大槪因爲便於控制市區的緣故，所以便設在舊英法工部局公董局的原址，起初的時候，好像還漆上「臨時辦事處」的字樣，後來却又抹去了，頗有老死此鄉的模樣。究竟如何，當然非局外人可知。</p>
<p>最近的消息，却又聽說工務敎育兩局要遷回市中心區了，那末，又好像這常日的市政重心，依然有借重的一日。撲朔迷離之餘，這市中心區大槪也會感激流涕的。</p>
<p>但是，這一次交通管制的市中心區，顯然是「冒牌」了。市中心區旣然不容開支店，設分號，當然更不容「天有二日」了。</p>
<p>並且，以熱鬧區域而論，這一段也許可以稱中心，以整個上海市的版圖來說，「市中心」一席，究竟還是讓給老大哥。旣然已有市中心，這一次交通管制的區域，再不容混淆視聽，我想，充其量，只能名之爲「市區」吧！</p>
<h3>一聲甜吻</h3>
<p>— 陳中繼譯自八月份讀者文摘</p>
<p>時：第二次世界大戰中。</p>
<p>地：羅馬尼亞隧道火車通過隧道的一刻。</p>
<p>人：少女，羅馬尼亞人，老太太和德國軍官。</p>
<p>情節：火車沒有進隧道的時候四個旅客都很規矩地坐着；移時，火車內一片漆黑，原來火車已經開入隧道了。那時候在黑暗中驀然傳來一聲甜吻，接着是一下打耳光的聲音。等火車恢復光明的時候，只見得德國軍官的眼皮上有靑腫的一塊。</p>
<p>少女想：咦，怎麽會有那麼好胃口的男人，不愛吻我，却去吻那老太婆！</p>
<p>老太太想：這女孩子倒有烈性，給男人吻了一下，竟會大動肝火，報以掌摑。</p>
<p>德國軍官想：哈，好久沒有給女人吃耳巴子了，給女人吃耳巴子是挺有趣的呢，我得謝謝這個强吻少女的羅馬尼亞人哪。</p>
<p>這時候比德國軍官更高興的是羅馬尼亞人，因爲是他吻了一下自己手背，接着又把那可恨的德國軍人狠命地打了一個耳光，結果却一點痕跡也沒有露出。</p>
<h3>如今上海</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>如今上海，玻璃過剩，書本恐慌，學校更鬧荒。這之中，一言難盡，講了「一千〇一夜」也請不淸。</p>
<p>如今上海，「民主口號」過剩，秩序恐慌，走上馬路，車子行人，無不只見自己不見人家，走路的人看見汽車橫衝直撞、莫不怒目切齒，等到一朝自己坐上汽車，却怪路上爲何儘是討厭的行人？等電車的人，看見車子過站不停，莫不怒目切齒，而等到自己上了電車，却希望一直開到目的地。鳴呼自由泛濫，變成自私！</p>
<h3>電車公司困難種種　兩位查票員的解釋</h3>
<p>（編者按：本文係電車公司查票員梁世樂梁河伯的來稿，雖基於公司立場說話，但關於希望乘客合作各點，亦頗值市民參考，特爲披露如下：）</p>
<p>現在我們欲爲這在目下被各界紛紛責難下的英商電車公司作一點小小的申訴。雖然在我們立塲上來說，這是多餘的。我們僅是査票員。</p>
<p>姍姍來遲</p>
<p>在這烈日下等候電車，是一件令人煩惱的事，尤其是每每等上半個鐘點以上，還是不見車輛前來，關於道點各位乘客也許早就知道這原因了，因爲在敵僞時期，公司中一切物資，早經搬運殆盡，尤以車胎缺乏更甚，因此無軌電車如十八路及廿路等皆不能行駛。又因十六路等路綫，車少人多，更足以引致車胎損壞，但這一點祇要有車胎運用時，自能迎刃而解。</p>
<p>為何不停</p>
<p>等了好半天的乘客，突然見電車來了，正在高興的時候，忽然那輛電車却停也不停地開去了，道不能怪一般乘客動氣了。讓我來解釋一番：公司對於車輛行駛之間隔，均有嚴密的規定時間，每晨出廠時早就排了時間依序開出，且每條路綫上有專司監督車輛的露天査票和路綫兩盡頭的寫票員管理行駛。在這樣嚴密的管理下，在戰前根本很少有電車「脫擋」之事發生。然而，現今情形可不同了，人多車少，更因路上車輛衆多，阻塞要道，意外事件屢次發生，電車如接龍般連續一起，好容易得解決後，每站必然人山人海。試想在站上久等的乘客見電車來了，那有不拼命上車之理？但車廂內早擠得水洩不通，可是乘客們還是祗顧往裏面擠。上面的客人不能下車，下面的軋在車門口不能上。時時有僵持之局面，故而每每使脫擋的車子更形脫擋了。遇有脫擋車子的局面時，公司同人因多次所得的經騐和保障乘客們的安全起見，不得已不管地開去，因爲後面的車子會來的。關於這點，先要解決上海的交通秩序問題。</p>
<p>空車亦不停</p>
<p>每當上午八九時上寫字間的時候，每個站上總是擠滿了人，忽然一部二路電直在愚園路卸下了乘客，就開足了馬力一直的駛去，靜安寺不停，赫德路不停，可能的話連西摩路也不停；被遺棄的那些客人，因而全都怒目切齒。我知道他們心中充滿着恨。但是你們錯怪我們了，因爲當電車停在靜安寺站上如果停，可能擠上一車子，而到赫德路和西摩路時，祗能吸收極少數的客人，又時因爲在靜安寺擠滿了一車，司機就有權可不停駛在近處的站頭。因此依照各站上容納客人數量爲比率，每隔幾部車子我們放一部空車子到赫德路或西摩路去，記得有一次我見西摩路上實在擠得緊，便特地到靜安寺命令放一部空車子去。其時我也押車而往，不料車到赫德路，一個客人因見空車不停，就攀住鐵門不放，我恐生事，就叫司機停了車。於是其他乘客就一擁而上車，那上車的客人，不問靑紅皂白，就用吐沫吐我一臉。我要和他理論，但其他客人皆聲勢汹汹，決沒有人會同情我的。我祗能啞子吃黃連。車到西摩路時，一羣乘客擠上車子，高興地喊道：「運道—運道—連位子也坐着了。」然而他們能坐這位子的代價，就是我以吃吐沫換來的。</p>
<p>排隊登車</p>
<p>以上三點情形，常引致乘客的誤解。我們不能否認，有些塲合下，我們很多不能做到以服務各乘客爲目標的宗旨。我們絕對願意各界批評，但不歡迎敵視的漫駡，我們希望公正的指敎和良好改進之途，但是最要的，還是請求各位乘客和本公司仝人密切的合作。最簡而易舉的就是一律排隊登車！本公司仝人爲了這一點上，不知受了多少寃枉。公司當局特意在每乘客衆多的站上，設有査票員來協助各乘客列隊，有時好容易成了隊，但一見車子來了，又亂了隊，等於白白地排了隊。年靑力壯的可能一湧而上，可是你不要開心，你家中也有年弱的雙親和嬌小的弱妹，你保守這良好秩序，也就是帮助你自己的家人。</p>
<p>以上各點乃是我們個人的見解和解釋，唯一的希望，就是請各位和本公司仝人合作，並請求報紙能多登載一些有關公共道德的文章！</p>

<p>報載前日梵皇渡路鴻達花線廠十四歲女工陳小妹，因淸理花紗，被滾筒車上之線拖住，捲人機內，將手臂連肩軋斷，骨肉與皮僅連一線，血流滿地，經召救護車送憶定盤路同仁第二醫院急救，爲了索付門診費四千元及保證金五十萬元，廠主史美才儘身邊所帶十萬。五千元先付外，餘款甚至由警員担保。該院總務主任張雷竟未答允先行急救，連護士朱靜嫻也冷冷地說：「這裏公家是沒錢貼的，手續辦好，再救人。」以致延遲時刻，使陳小妹流血過度，該院拒絕收容，祗好轉送紅十字會醫院急救，生命危殆。現在該院院長黃銘新總務主任張雷已爲長寗路警局傳訊。（八月十五日鐵報）關於此案法律上的責任，以及十四歲的孩子竟因生活所迫，敢和機器作伴，負担那不勝負担的緊重工作，涉及整個社會問題另文討論外，先就醫院職責，提出幾點感想：</p>
<p>救人濟世</p>
<p>我國朝野上下，提倡公醫制度垂二十年，但因主持衛生行政當局缺少全盤計劃和決心，私醫不能全以救人濟世爲職志，造成現在醫生以金錢的多寡爲治病仔細程度深淺的準他，於是賣假藥，　大病情，賣弄噱頭，貽誤病家，這些事層出不窮；而公醫生的「飯碗主義」，敷衍搪塞，視病家如「麻煩的顧客」，爲了飯碗不得不應付一下，尤給社會以不信任公醫生的惡印象。須知醫生應以濟世救人爲職志，醫生決不是自由職業，乃是人類鞏固團體，造福人羣，貢獻其才智以爲人羣服務的事業。治醫者有了這種認醫爲職責的決心，始可以悉心硏究，减少病家的寃苦。公醫制度即是達成這種目的，使人力普遍利用的制度，即是一切的醫生應由國家聘任，分配在全國普遍的各地，由國家負祖其生活費用，必使待遇較現在一般公敎人員爲高，足够其生活，而醫生即須貢獻其才智以爲國民服務，公務員是人民的公僕，醫生便應是人民健康的公僕。</p>
<p>服務大眾</p>
<p>醫業旣爲服務大衆的事業，醫生更應貫澈其服務火衆的表現。若干醫院醫生診斷完畢，開出藥方，都會介紹給你一家藥房，諄諄吿誡：此藥祗有該處有售，或該藥房藥品高超含量準確，或持此條購買可以優待。但是結果，一樣的藥品遵命到指定藥房，貨價不惟得不到優待，反會高出若干，據說這就是醫生介紹的「回扣」。醫院方面有了保證金的名目，許多窮小子就診不易，急症貧病，簡直無望診治。據說有些醫院的三等病房，還須　熟人活動一些小費才可以設法到。錢，錢，錢，上海是錢的世界，但苦了那些窮苦的同胞。難道窮苦的國民，連生病治病的自由都剝奪了嗎？</p>
<p>兩大要求</p>
<p>在公醫制度尙未建立以前，爲挽救目前的畸形不合理現象，我提出二個要求：</p>
<p>第一，醫院爲了維持業務，自須收取診費，但必須收支合理。頭二等病房收費較高可取其盈餘貼補貧病，過有急症，更須先爲診治，後論診費。我國傳統觀念，感恩圖報，種根很深。你救活了他的命；他決不會忘了你，你這樣大方的以救人爲心，其感人之深，容或使病家由衷的酬報你更多些。</p>
<p>藥名統一</p>
<p>第二，藥名統一，藥品標價，我國對藥名素乏統一，諸如殺蟲藥「山道年」，有譯「蘇妥紉」者，「配尼西林」有譯「盤尼希林」者，同一藥品，不同其名，乃可詭稱此非彼物，上下其手，同物異價。甚且以錠劑改成粉劑朦混病家，恰使惟利是岡者遂其詭計。同時醫生開出方單，全部西文，更使病家如墮五里霧中，拿到藥房，茫然無主，一任藥房計算其隨心所喜的利潤。作者曾以同一鈣片之方，分赴幾家藥房，同牌貨物，價格相差千元以上，所以藥名亟應請負責衛生行政當局統一譯名，統一標價。同時醫生今後處方，是否能儘量以中文爲主，免得病家受欺亦値硏究；而且用中文以後，病源病狀，服法調攝，都可一目瞭然，無須諄諄吿誡，旣省唇舌，又利病家，何樂不爲？現在海關已明令以中文爲主，醫生何斤斤於書寫西文？而且「德名」，「英名」，更示人以派別之見，倒不如中國人用中國字，旣恰當又不失國體。寫幾行「　形字」，有甚麼「噱頭」呢？</p>

<h3>Premier Song Issues Written Statement: Exchange Rate Readjusted, Hoping for National Cooperation to Stabilize Prices; Minister Peng Announces at Yesterday's Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Propaganda Minister Peng Xuepei, yesterday at 6 PM, hosted domestic and foreign journalists at the Shanghai Municipal Government conference room, announcing that the Central Bank has been approved to adjust the foreign exchange rate, which will be changed on the exchange board this morning (19th) at 10 AM. Minister Peng first stated: Premier Song was unable to attend in person due to official duties, and then read Premier Song's written statement, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Today, the Central Bank has been approved to adjust the foreign exchange rate. On the 17th of this month, the government also decided to abolish export taxes. The purpose is to seek a balance in import and export trade and the vigorous development of production enterprises. In the future, it will continue to use gold reserves to stabilize the domestic currency value. Now that the purchasing power of the national currency abroad has exceeded the domestic currency value, this change in the foreign exchange rate can bring about a reasonable harmony between domestic and foreign currency values. It is hoped that people across the country will understand this purpose, and especially that production enterprises across the country, especially those dealing with essential goods for people's livelihoods, will appreciate the significance of the government's policies, which are related to the entire national economy and people's livelihoods, and even the safety of the entire future of production, and work together to ensure that prices are stabilized as a result.</p>
<p>Tracing Relevant Factors</p>
<p>Before deciding on the method, the government conducted a detailed review of various relevant economic issues, and especially carefully considered the timing of implementation. The important factors related to this issue are traced back to their origins and briefly explained as follows:</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance against Japan, our country suffered heavy direct losses of materials, and a large number of factories and all production equipment were destroyed, resulting in a significant decline in production capacity. In addition, foreign trade was extremely difficult, and imports were on the verge of extinction. By the time victory was achieved, domestic materials were in extreme shortage. Therefore, the most urgent need at that time was to replenish a large amount of materials, and the most effective and rapid method of replenishment was undoubtedly to encourage the import of foreign materials.</p>
<p>Implementing Parallel Policies</p>
<p>The provisional measures for the management of foreign exchange implemented in early March of this year have yielded significant results in terms of the expected effects. Over the past five months, the quantity of imported materials has increased, and prices have gradually decreased. However, the profits of some imported goods are still excessive, and some imported goods compete with domestic goods, which has a significant impact on domestic industry. As for the export industry, it has not made satisfactory progress, and the foreign exchange earned from exports is far less than the amount from imports. At the same time, agricultural and industrial products that can supply foreign markets are difficult to compete in the international market due to high production costs and are in a disadvantageous position. The continued collection of export taxes further increases the burden on export trade. All of the above require innovative measures to solve the difficulties currently encountered. The current time is the most appropriate for implementing reform measures. On the one hand, a bumper harvest is expected, and grain prices have gradually fallen. On the other hand, the export season is about to enter a period of sustained prosperity. After implementation, the following good results should be obtained: (1) Encourage exports and reduce imports; (2) Encourage overseas Chinese to remit funds back to the country; (3) Support domestic production enterprises. All of these can help to balance imports and exports. In addition to these measures, the government is also working hard to implement other parallel policies. In terms of transportation, it will make every effort to restore trunk routes by land and sea, and within the scope of financial possibility, expand as much as possible the port management and dispatching of national industrial and commercial centers such as Shanghai. It will set up strong management agencies to reduce the cost of loading and unloading goods and take all necessary steps to promote the smooth flow of trade. In terms of the disposal of enemy and puppet industries, it is planned to transfer them to private operation as much as possible. The government has absolutely no intention of adopting a universal state-owned system. As for larger production units, such as the China Textile Company, which require a large amount of capital and cannot be taken over by merchants for a while, they will be temporarily managed and operated by the government. However, the equity will be transferred in a planned manner within a short period of time, and the national treasury can obtain appropriate compensation. As for the capital market, it is currently actively planning to restore the Shanghai Stock Exchange to divert idle funds and provide a flexible way for state-owned enterprises to transfer when needed. Other enemy and puppet materials and equipment are being distributed and sold separately to increase supply and supplement treasury revenue. As for regular tax revenue, it is also being effectively organized and is increasing monthly. However, post-war reconstruction involves many aspects, and temporary expenditures are enormous. The response policy should be to postpone non-essential expenditures. During this period of reconstruction transition, the suffering felt by all parties is unavoidable. The government is determined to use all its strength to balance the budget, stabilize prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. In short, the ultimate goal is to seek a peaceful and prosperous life for the people across the country and a prosperous social economy, so as to maintain our country's due position in the international community.</p>
<h3>Central Bank to Post Rates Today; Mayor Calls Important Meeting; Urges All Sectors Not to Raise Prices on Pretexts</h3>
<p>After Peng read Premier Song's statement, Mr. Wei Jingmeng, a specialist from the International Propaganda Office, translated it into English. Peng then rose and stated that the Central Bank will officially post the foreign exchange rate tomorrow (the 19th) at 10 AM. At 9 AM, Mayor Wu will convene an important meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Government with the chairmen and executive directors of various industry associations in the city. Those invited include the chairman and executive directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Shops Association, the Textile Industry Association, the Department Store Industry Association, the Oil Industry Association, the Flour Industry Association, the Flour Mill Industry Association, China Vegetable Oil Plant, China Textile Company, and the general managers of Sincere Company, Wing On Company, Sun Sun Company, and The Sun Company. In addition to announcing the government's important policy of adjusting the foreign exchange rate, it will also appeal to the heads of various industry associations not to raise the prices of domestic goods that are not related to the foreign exchange rate on the pretext of the exchange rate adjustment, because the government's decision to abolish export taxes and adjust the exchange rate is purely for the development of production enterprises and export trade, so as to improve the current economic difficulties. As for general domestic goods, which are not fundamentally related to the foreign exchange rate, there is no reason to raise prices accordingly, especially for grain. With bumper harvests in various provinces, grain prices will gradually fall. On this point, it is hoped that the media will publicize more and assist the government in its efforts to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>Establishing a Port Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Minister Peng then made another announcement, saying: "The port of Shanghai has always been congested, and merchant ships have had to wait for two or three weeks outside the port to unload their cargo, which has been criticized by foreigners. The government has recently instructed the organization of a Port Affairs Committee, with Mayor Wu Guozhen as the chairman, and representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Finance, the Resources Committee, the Garrison Headquarters, the Jianghai Customs, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, and various shipping companies as members, to study how to reform port affairs, control warehouses, docks, river traffic, and dredge the Huangpu River, etc., in order to quickly improve port affairs and cooperate with the measures just announced."</p>
<p>Purchasing 50,000 Tons of Vietnamese Rice</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Peng also clarified the recent domestic grain situation. He said: "This year, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces have had bumper harvests of grain. In Jiangxi, due to the new grain already entering the market, prices have fallen sharply. Although rice prices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have not fallen due to the current period of transition between harvests, there is no cause for concern. Because there are many ships now, the government is planning to transport grain from Sichuan, Jiangxi and other places in a continuous stream, so the rebound in rice prices in this city is only a matter of time. The government has also discussed with Mr. Mu, head of the French economic delegation, to order 50,000 tons of Vietnamese rice, which will be transported to China in the second half of this year. The rice is handled by four French companies, namely (1) Loddon, (2) Oriviel, (3) Canti Nintal, and (4) Denise Frere."</p>
<p>At yesterday's reception, in addition to Premier Song being unable to attend due to official business and Minister Peng presiding over the announcement, those present included Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, Feng Youzhen, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, Wei Jingmeng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the International Propaganda Office, Zhu Xubai, Director of the News Publication Office of the Municipal Government, and more than 60 domestic and foreign journalists. The meeting adjourned at 6:40 PM.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Director of the Customs Administration</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) Yesterday, reporters interviewed Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, to ask for his opinion. According to Zhang, the government's implementation of the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate in accordance with the actual situation, although the adjusted tariff standards may not meet the ideals of domestic industry and commerce, is very suitable for the current environment in terms of reason and sentiment. (Please refer to page 7 for additional information on the exchange rate change.)</p>
<p>Fluctuations in the Price of U.S. Dollars Over the Past Year</p>
<p>Supporting Private Industry and Commerce; Industrial Loans and Technical Guidance Will Be Handled First; Ministers Wang, Zhu, and Yu Leave Guling for Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu stated that industrial loans have been approved by the authorities, and the measures have been drafted and will be announced soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Wang Yunwu and Zhu Jiahua are scheduled to leave Guling for Nanjing together on the 19th. On the afternoon of the 18th, Wang paid another visit to Chairman Chiang, reporting on the recent measures of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Afterwards, he told reporters that supporting the post-war recovery of private industry and commerce does not require petitions from the industrial and commercial sectors. As a matter of duty and conscience, he is obliged to do so. The way to support this will be to start with handling industrial loans and providing technical guidance. Detailed measures will be implemented gradually. Zhu stated that it is possible that Chairman Chiang will invite university presidents and professors to come to Guling in batches to inquire about matters.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei visited Chairman Chiang at 9:30 AM on the 18th for an hour, and visited Mr. Ma at 1 PM for more than an hour. According to Yu, the visit to Chairman Chiang was to report on the recovery of transportation and the implementation steps in the future, and the discussion with Marshal Ma was purely in the field of military science and did not involve other matters. Yu is scheduled to leave Guling for Nanjing on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>Three Main Reasons for Improvement in Our Financial Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Sources concerned stated that the recent improvement in China's financial situation is mainly due to three reasons: (1) The clearing of enemy and puppet property has made headway, and sales in some areas have been smooth, increasing treasury revenue; (2) The revenue of state-owned enterprises has increased; (3) Various tax revenues have also increased. Under these circumstances, there has been a salary increase for civil servants. It is understood that this salary increase was implemented based on the principle of Chairman accepting the proposal of the Legislative Yuan. This move will increase the treasury's monthly expenditure by 15 billion yuan, but due to the improvement in revenue, it is no longer necessary to rely entirely on issuing currency.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen Cheng Works All Night</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Amidst the busy military affairs, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng worked all night at the Ministry of National Defense yesterday and did not return to his residence.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops at Beidaihe Station Attacked Again by Communist Troops; Continued to Hear Reports on Anping Incident</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] A portion of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps, stationed at the Beidaihe train station, was attacked by Communist troops yesterday. According to the Yishi Daily, 10,000 Communist troops have disarmed the National Army road protection team guarding the station and surrounded a portion of the regular National Army troops in the area. The fighting continued into the night. National Army troops from Tangshan are currently rushing to Beidaihe to reinforce.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] The 25-member group investigating the Anping incident continued its work as usual on the 18th. According to the rotational chairmanship system, Major General Zhang Shuheng, the government representative, presided over the meeting on the 18th. First, Lieutenant Colonel Burge, commander of the 1st Marine Battalion, and Corporal Wei Gen, who participated in the Anping battle, were questioned. Lieutenant Colonel Burge's report provided the most new materials. He stated: (1) The composition of the patrol on July 29 was four patrol vehicles in front and four patrol vehicles in the rear, with fifteen transport vehicles escorted in the middle, commanded by a lieutenant, with four sergeants and thirty-seven soldiers, and one medical officer. The weapons included one .50 caliber machine gun, one .30 caliber machine gun, set up on the front and rear vehicles, two 60mm grenade launchers, ten Browning automatic rifles, one Thompson submachine gun, and twenty-six ten-round rifles. This patrol was an enhanced version of the general patrol. The general patrol had a minimum of 25 soldiers and one officer. This patrol was assigned soldiers from the 1st Regiment in addition to the soldiers belonging to the 1st Battalion. Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng pointed out that this kind of formation exceeded the battalion's structure and must have been organized by the division. (2) The enhanced formation of the patrol was due to the fact that U.S. military personnel were attacked twice on the way from Beiping to Tianjin on July 28, and the division headquarters had received reports. (3) There were no National Army troops stationed in the area five miles east and west of Anping, which is now a place for Communist troops to enter and exit, but he did not see it himself. (4) He denied that combatants were concentrated in the front of the convoy. There were also combatants in the rear of the column. Duke's claim that the rear machine gun could not be operated was because he was a passenger and did not understand the overall situation. (5) Before the patrol set off, the instructions he gave were: A, escort the transport vehicles to Beiping, B, clear any obstacles encountered on the road, and if shot at, accelerate and pass through. If there is unusual shooting that may endanger the vehicles, materials, and personnel, retaliate. (6) There was a truck in the convoy approved by the division headquarters, loaded with relief supplies, with four Chinese people on board. (7) His report to the Executive Headquarters was drafted after interviewing 49 people. He did not know about the National Army providing the U.S. military with intelligence. (8) There was a wireless vehicle in the front and rear of the patrol. Before the patrol set off that day, the battalion headquarters specially set up a radio station outside Tianjin to facilitate long-distance communication with the patrol. Contact with the patrol was lost at 11:05. (9) Due to the obstacles laid on the road and the deployment of troops on all three sides of the highway, it can be seen that the attackers were acting in a planned manner. The questioning was completed at 11:30. Corporal Wei Gen's report contained roughly the same content. It was not completed until 1 PM.</p>

<h3>Communist Party Holds Meeting in Harbin</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Democratic League Participated</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Tianjin, 18th] Local newspapers reported that the CCP held the "Northeast Provincial Representative Conference" in Harbin from the 7th to the 15th of this month. More than 80 representatives from various parties attended, including representatives from the Democratic League. The meeting passed six resolutions, including sending a telegram of thanks to the Soviet Union, "liberating the Northeast," sending greetings to Mao Zedong, demanding the release of Zhang Xueliang, and protesting the National Government's ban on the circulation of Soviet military currency in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Marshal Ma Cables Zhou Enlai; Rumored to Be Related to Resuming Peace Talks; Ambassador Stuart Postpones Departure from Beiping to Nanjing to Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Marshal Ma is in good spirits after arriving at Lushan for the fourth time and may fly to Nanjing from here on the 21st or 22nd.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] It is rumored that when Marshal Ma visited Chairman Chiang after arriving at Lushan, he discussed how to resume peace talks. There is much close attention to this new development here. Colonel Ke Yi, Marshal Ma's representative in Nanjing, received a telegram from Marshal Ma from Guling on the evening of the 17th, entrusted to him for Zhou Enlai. He then drove to Liangyuan New Village at 10:30 AM on the 18th to visit Zhou, leaving at 11:40 AM. As for the content of Marshal Ma's telegram, reporters interviewed both the Marshal Ma's office and the Communist Party delegation, but both were tight-lipped. People on the Communist Party side only said that the overall situation is deteriorating and hoped that no illusions would be held. However, it is speculated that Marshal Ma's telegram to Zhou was related to resuming peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] Ambassador Stuart was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 19th, but the trip was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. He has had more social engagements in the past two days. In each speech, he said that peace is not yet hopeless. Yesterday, he told students at Yenching University that "it is now even more necessary for me and Marshal Ma to continue our efforts" and put forward the hope that China would have a new revolutionary movement, led by Chairman Chiang, to restore the original revolutionary spirit, passively reform politics, and actively realize the livelihood principle of the Three Principles of the People. Ambassador Stuart is preparing to bring all necessary items to Nanjing on this trip, which can dispel the rumors that Stuart will soon leave the ambassadorial post. Tonight, Li Zongren will host a banquet for Ambassador Stuart and his secretary, Chuan Jingbo.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] It is said that holding the Lushan Talks is inevitable, but it will not be a formal meeting. The reason is that it is currently an extraordinary period, and the government must adopt public opinion from time to time for reference in order to gather wisdom and benefit.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Central Committee Member Chen Guofu is scheduled to go down the mountain and return to Nanjing on the morning of the 19th. Also, Gu Zhenglun, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, is scheduled to go down the mountain at 9 AM on the morning of the 19th to Nanjing and then to Shanghai. The talk of Gu's resignation has passed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Zeng Qi and Liu Dongyan, leaders of the China Youth Party, visited Chairman Chiang at the headquarters at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 18th, the third meeting since arriving at Guling, and expressed their farewells. They left after half an hour. Zeng and his party will leave Guling for Nanjing on the morning of the 19th and issued the following parting remarks: I came here for a summer vacation. Although I visited Chairman Chiang three times, they were all friendly chats without formal consultations. The outside rumors are mostly speculations. (Please read page 2 for news about the internal disputes of the Youth Party.)</p>
<h3>Democratic League to Hold Central Standing Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Zhang Shenfu met with reporters on the morning of the 18th: The Democratic League will hold a Central Standing Committee meeting soon to discuss how to cope with the current situation and intends to express something. It has not yet been decided whether the meeting will be held in Shanghai or Nanjing. Zhang also said that the expansion of the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is causing suffering to the people, and this responsibility should be borne by both sides.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Use Young Children to Spy on National Army Military Information</h3>
<p>Five People Arrested in a Small Boat in Pukou</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] At around 6 PM on the 17th, the harbor police station at Zhongshan Wharf in Xiaguan arrested five young children spying on military information in a small boat crossing the river from Pukou. The youngest was only 12 years old, and the oldest was no more than 15 years old. According to their confession, they were members of the New Fourth Army's Huaibei children's corps, dispatched from Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Mingguang to Nanjing to spy on military information. The police station has transferred the five children to the police department for handling.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Repatriating Japanese Residents in Northeast China</h3>
<p>Li Minran Flies Back to Harbin</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Shenyang, 17th] Regarding the repatriation of Japanese residents and prisoners in Northeast China, an agreement was first reached between the U.S. and the CCP after negotiations between the U.S. side and the CCP. Finally, the U.S. side forwarded a recommendation to the central government. Now, after a decision by the three parties, in addition to Dalian, Lushun, and Xinyizhou, there are still about 300,000 Japanese residents, starting from August 20, who will pass through the three locations of Songhua River, Lafa, and Duxi to the National Army defense area, and then transfer to Huludao to return to their country. Li Minran, Lin Biao's representative, came to Shenyang this time in connection with this matter. Li flew back to Harbin with the U.S. representative of the Military Mediation Department on the 17th.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Increase Troops and Intensify Siege; Situation in Datong Increasingly Critical; Six Divisions of the National Army Are Reinforcing from Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Military news: The situation in Datong is critical, but the Communist troops have not yet entered the urban area. Six divisions of the National Army are reinforcing northward from southern Shanxi. The Communist troops have redeployed their forces to attack the Zhengtai Railway, attempting to prevent the National Army from reinforcing and attempting to forcibly enter Datong City, but the morale of the defenders is strong and determined to defend to the death.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] Ma Zhanshan continued to receive reports this morning that fierce fighting continued around Datong. The defenders are still at a disadvantage, and casualties on both sides are heavy. For ease of command, it has been transferred from the Second War Zone to the Twelfth War Zone for command. Therefore, it is rumored that Zuo Yi flew to Datong on the 16th for a six-hour inspection. The original plan was to airlift 4,000 reinforcements, but only more than 1,000 people have been transported. Yesterday, airplanes still transported a large amount of medical supplies, but the Yue Temple highland, the only barrier to the airport, is in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Beiping electric message: Communist troops intensified the encirclement of Datong, using artillery to bombard the city streets. Now the municipal authorities have taken emergency measures to burn military and political documents. According to reports, Communist General He Long convened a military conference in Fengzhen, more than ten miles north of Datong, apparently to discuss taking Datong as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Tianjin, 17th] Newspapers reported from Taiyuan that the Datong battle was becoming more intense. Last night, the Communist troops left more than 100 bodies, including 20 Japanese bodies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Taiyuan, 18th] The Zhengtai Railway has been severely damaged by the Communist troops. Currently, only the Taiyuan to Duanting section, the Qinquan to Baiyangshu section, and the Niangziguan to Shizhuang section have resumed traffic.

<h3>The North Jiangsu Battlefront to See New Developments: Li Mo'an Inspects Yangzhou and Taizhou; Communist Forces in Eastern Henan Appear 10 Miles from Kaifeng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangdu Eighteenth Dispatch] The commander of the First Pacification Zone, Li Mo'an, flew to Yangzhou and Taizhou today to inspect and give instructions. He arrived in Yangzhou at 12:00 noon and then flew elsewhere. It is generally expected that the North Jiangsu battlefront will soon see new developments. After the failure of the Communist forces' counterattack on the right flank, they are now incapable of further action. In order to completely lift the threat to Yangzhou, the Nationalist forces on the left flank will likely advance towards Shaobo and Gaoyou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taizhou Eighteenth Dispatch] The Communist forces are still moving between Benjiaji and Fuan. Communist forces near Baipu have destroyed highways and made contact with a unit of the Nationalist 49th Division. The Communist forces originally entrenched in Maojiabao have been routed after a sweep and are fleeing towards Shimei.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Eighteenth Dispatch] According to reports, the Communist forces under Liu Bocheng in Henan province are now 10 miles from Kaifeng. Neutral observers from Kaifeng report that the city gates of Kaifeng have been closed due to the Communist forces' advance. Liu's Communist forces, numbering 150,000, are attacking the Longhai Railway from the north, while Yang Yong's Communist forces, numbering 50,000, are attacking from the Yellow River area towards the southwest. Military sources report that the Communist forces have already occupied Xingxian and entered Zhuxianzhen. Nationalist forces are currently engaged in combat with the Communist forces in Liuhe and Minquan.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Situation is Calm; Groups Continue Working as Usual</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan Seventeenth Dispatch] The situation in Shandong province has been generally calm for the past few days, with only occasional minor clashes in various locations. Although the work of the Executive Headquarters seems to have stalled, the American representatives of the Jinan, Tai'an, Yancheng, and Gaomi groups are all continuing to work as usual and have not withdrawn.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Changing the Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The statement issued yesterday by Premier Song of the Executive Yuan covered a very wide range. To analyze it roughly, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A decision to abolish export taxes;</p>
<p>(2) A decision to change the exchange rate;</p>
<p>(3) To fully restore trunk road and waterway lines to facilitate transportation;</p>
<p>(4) To reorganize port affairs to reduce loading and unloading costs;</p>
<p>(5) Enemy and puppet industries to be transferred to private management as much as possible;</p>
<p>(6) The equity of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Corporation to be transferred in a planned manner;</p>
<p>(7) To restore the Shanghai Stock Exchange as soon as possible;</p>
<p>(8) To separately allocate and sell enemy and puppet goods and equipment;</p>
<p>(9) To reorganize tax revenue to balance the budget.</p>
<p>(10) Concluding with the ultimate goal of stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods, in order to achieve a prosperous economy and a stable and happy life.</p>
<p>Premier Song's statement touched on all aspects of finance and economics. Since the opening of foreign exchange in March of this year and the establishment of import and export trade regulations, the government's announced financial and economic policies can be said to have been most important in this statement yesterday.</p>
<p>However, items (3) and (4) below to item (10) have either already begun or are still awaiting design and implementation. Their relationship to the present is not very close. The two items (1) and (2) are the most closely related and will have an immediate reaction and effect.</p>
<p>The abolition of export taxes was advocated by some in the late Qing Dynasty. In modern countries, except for monopolies or certain raw materials that still retain a portion of the export tax, the widespread collection of export taxes for financial reasons is extremely rare. The decision by the Supreme National Defense Council to abolish it entirely is indeed a noteworthy event in the financial history of our country. Especially today, when exports are extremely depressed and international lending cannot be balanced, it is also the most urgent and reasonable thing to do.</p>
<p>As for the change in the exchange rate, although the figure is still awaiting formal announcement by the Central Bank at 10:00 AM today, there is no doubt that the listed exchange rate will be raised. To what extent will it be raised? Although this question is of deep concern to the general public, it will be announced soon, and we do not need to speculate too much in a very short period of time. According to the government's consistent approach and the authorities' emphasis on stabilizing prices, it should not differ too much from the current black market price, right?</p>
<p>The biggest problem following the exchange rate change is, of course, prices. The government is most concerned about this; the general public is also most concerned about this. We believe that, apart from some speculators deliberately creating trouble, there is actually no reason to excessively stimulate prices due to the exchange rate change. The arguments are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The black market exchange rate has been hovering around 2,500 or 2,600 for a long time, and even exceeded 700 last Saturday. Therefore, if the newly set exchange rate does not significantly exceed reality, then it will not have any stimulating effect on prices at all.</p>
<p>(2) Most of the imported goods that have arrived at the port were settled at prices that were relatively cheaper.</p>
<p>(3) The authorities are very serious about the issue of foreign exchange. We believe that there will be no more changes in a considerable period of time after this change.</p>
<p>(4) Currently, foreign goods are flooding the market, and the prices of several types of goods have already fallen to the equivalent of the cost of import.</p>
<p>(5) This year's autumn harvest is abundant, and the supply of goods is different from the period during the War of Resistance and the early period after the victory.</p>
<p>Even so, our people's enthusiasm for speculation and foreign goods has always been very strong. After the restoration, many emerging enterprises and many old businesses have also engaged in imports and hoarding due to the difficulty of production. These kinds of speculative and hoarding activities still need to be deeply noticed and prevented by both the public and private sectors. At the same time, actively promote frugality and advocate domestic goods. This is the fundamental salvation.</p>
<p>Developing production and prospering the social economy are not simple matters. It is inherently a luxury to solve all difficulties with a single, simple method. Therefore, in addition to raising the exchange rate, we believe that there are many things that still need to be addressed separately and implemented in tandem. For example, many unnecessary and undesirable foreign goods that are currently available may be further restricted or completely prohibited. We feel that imported goods should be handled in four major categories: (1) prohibited, (2) restricted, (3) freely imported, and (4) imports encouraged. Because even though the exchange rate has changed, domestic and foreign prices may not be balanced for a while. Looking at the prices in our country, they have risen four or five thousand times compared to before the war, while in the United States, they have only risen three or four times. (Based on the black market) The current exchange rate has risen approximately 600 times, which, multiplied by the price of goods in the United States, is only 1,800 times. We do not yet know how much the degree of this increase will be at this time, but we believe it will not increase by more than double, right? Therefore, in order to maintain domestic industries and save the industrial and commercial crisis, in addition to political measures, we still hope that all citizens will practice frugality and happily use domestic goods. Although this is an old saying, it is the fundamental solution.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of Marshall's Mediation</h3>
<p>Marshal Marshall came to China from the United States more than seven months ago. As President Truman's special envoy, he mediated the political and military conflicts within China, hoping that his credibility, prestige, and detached, objective attitude could promote China's unification and fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the United Nations. Apart from a brief return to the United States in March, Marshal Marshall has been running around in China for at least six months, so-called "wearing disheveled hair and unkempt crown," with tireless effort and painstaking dedication. We, the Chinese people, can only express our heartfelt gratitude for his spirit of "not even warming the seat." Although the mediation work has not yet been fully accomplished, this is due to the obstinacy of a portion of China's warmongering elements, which will in no way damage Marshal Marshall's credibility and prestige, and even less so be regarded as an obstacle to Sino-American relations.</p>
<p>Although our evaluation of Marshal Marshall's mediation work in China is that "man proposes, God disposes," we have always believed that with his credibility, prestige, detachment, and objectivity, only with time and perseverance, "sincerity can move even metal and stone." We still have great expectations for Marshal Marshall's mediation.</p>
<p>However, the CCP is not the same! The CCP used to fear that negotiating with the government alone might be deceiving, so they sincerely hoped that the United States would mediate. We know that the reason why the CCP tried every means to appeal through the pens of American journalists for China to form a coalition government was originally to hope that the United States would favor the CCP and pressure the central government. Therefore, at first, they welcomed General Hurley, but then, because General Hurley was not used by them, they changed and attacked him. When Marshal Marshall was ordered to come to China, the CCP once again placed great hopes on him. Unexpectedly, after seven or eight months, although Marshal Marshall fairly persuaded, the CCP changed again and attacked Marshal Marshall, just like they attacked General Hurley in the past. In the past week or so, the strange theories of the Yan'an Liberation Daily and the Zhangjiakou CCP radio station have been endless. The CCP criticized the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, repeatedly insulting Marshal Marshall, saying that he was "deceiving" or calling him a "fool," and even insisted that Marshal Marshall was "mediating in name but aiding Chiang in reality," and made an absurd conclusion that "seven and a half months of mediation aided a larger civil war," as if China's civil war was not caused by the warmongering elements of the CCP who were intentionally planning to use force, but rather was made by Marshal Marshall who "came from afar." The CCP used to regard Marshal Marshall as a "god." Today, they even regard Marshal Marshall as a "liar" and a "fool!"</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall is still Marshal Marshall, the mediation is still the mediation, but the CCP's evaluation of Marshal Marshall's mediation is now worlds apart. Is it strange? It is not strange at all! The CCP has its own creed: "Everyone is a tool, everything is a process." Marshal Marshall himself, despite being a person of unparalleled credibility and prestige for a time, and Marshal Marshall's mediation, despite being a detached, objective work admired by all, in the eyes of the CCP, Marshal Marshall is still not its temporary "tool," and mediation is still not its momentary "process"?</p>
<p>To be honest, we have long seen through the CCP's tricks. The reason why the CCP will inevitably attack Marshal Marshall at this time is nothing more than hoping to bring the China issue to international arbitration! In other words, it is nothing more than praying for the Soviet Union to help the CCP betray the country! While Yan'an is shouting "pick up the guns" and "not hesitate to fight," it is also shouting "unconditional ceasefire," hoping to arouse international attention and come up with a common "punishment" of China, which would be "very happy." The CCP's approach naturally has its origins; it is just that our American friends are straightforward and naive enough that we used to say that the CCP may not be trustworthy, but they thought it was an overstatement. Now, the face of the CCP can probably be recognized clearly.</p>
<p>However, we would like to emphasize one more point: with all of Marshal Marshall's credibility and prestige in the United States, in China, and internationally, if he continues to patiently mediate China's political disputes, but unfortunately there is still no effect, then perhaps peace in China will at least temporarily be truly hopeless. Marshal Marshall is the epitome of Americans; we dare say that no one else can do what Marshal Marshall cannot do today. Even a peaceful elder like Marshal Marshall who has worked so hard to mediate can be insulted as a "liar" and a "fool," then who else cannot be scolded in the future? This is not only an insult to Marshal Marshall, but also tantamount to insulting all our American allies. Although this kind of rude defamation comes from the mouths of CCP members, they should still be considered "Chinese." Standing in the position of the Chinese people, we feel very ashamed to Marshal Marshall and to the United States. Therefore, we still earnestly hope that Marshal Marshall, with the cooperation of Ambassador Stuart, will continue to work hard to mediate, for China, for the United States, and even more for world peace, and forcibly implement the method of ending the conflict. Do not withdraw and return to the United States due to the CCP's anger, leaving the embers of the fire in Liaodong unextinguished! This is the cry of the Chinese people!</p>

<h3>The Double-Dealing Case of the Youth Party; Zhou Jidao Reported on the "Reform Movement" in Beijing; Reporters Raised Questions and He Had No Words to Answer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Eighteenth Dispatch] The truth about the internal disputes of the Youth Party was announced this morning at 10:00 AM by the Central Committee of the Youth Party under the organization of Zhou Jidao at a press conference. It is said that the main meanings of the party affairs reform movement they advocated are approximately the following: (1) Because a few leaders of the party have gradually lost the party's basic spirit and are increasingly becoming dictatorial and monopolistic; (2) Focusing on matters rather than people; (3) Not for the issue of competing for National Assembly representative quotas, but believing that it should be elected in a democratic manner; (4) Zuo Shunsheng's remarks in Shanghai that a few people in the newly established Central Committee have been expelled from the party are actually a joke. It also claimed that they have the right to expel Zuo Shunsheng and others from the party. After Zhou finished his report, reporters raised questions one after another. Should the Youth Party be represented by Zeng Qi or Zhou Jidao, etc., externally? Zhou had no answer. He was also asked about the political views of the newly established Central Committee? Zhou also had no words to answer. He was asked about the number of party members, and he hesitated. This double-dealing case of the Youth Party ended hastily under the questioning of reporters. It is reported that Zeng Qi and others heard about the press conference here in Guling and telegraphed Zhou last night to stop it, but Zhou insisted on not listening, and ultimately staged this ridiculous scene.</p>

<h3>勝利一年來 廣大地區仍遭封鎖 經濟混亂人民惶惑</h3>
<p>[Reported by the United Press in Nanjing on the 17th] One year after Japan's surrender, China still bears many signs of a conquered nation – the people are bewildered, disappointed, and demoralized, and the economic situation is chaotic and unstable. Yet Japan, which China helped defeat through years of heroic resistance, has made considerable progress in recovery and stability, and has in fact embarked on the path of democracy. This is a tragic irony. Although Japan was defeated, it now enjoys the benefits of peace, while the diseased body of the Chinese giant continues to be ravaged by war and internal division. People cannot travel freely within a vast territory, and large areas remain tightly blockaded. Floods, famines, and fear threaten the entire country. Under these tragic circumstances, while various countries have demobilized, China still maintains a large standing army, with two-thirds of the national expenditure going to military expenses. Millions of gaunt-faced people are struggling with death, without any protection. In this dark picture, the only bright spot is that all sides are clamoring for democracy, equality, and prosperity, but so far there are only empty words, without any action. The people are growing tired of hearing it and have lost faith. To solve China's deep-seated problems, there must be a leader with a strong will. As for how to implement it, there are no secrets. According to experts, the main steps are as follows: (1) unconditional and permanent peace; (2) restoration of transportation; (3) stabilization of the currency; (4) reduction of taxes; (5) subsidies for domestic industries and protection of foreign investment; (6) strict control of rent and prices; and (7) reduction in the size of the military. China is today spending billions of national currency to maintain a large army and engage in civil war, while there seems to be insufficient funds to repair the roads in the capital. The housing shortage is also quite urgent, and there are no first-class hotels available. The only Western-style hotel in Nanjing is occupied by American officers and their civilian secretaries, and non-military personnel are not allowed to enter. Rent is not controlled. The annual rent for the new site of the Nanjing Foreign Correspondents' Club is 50 million national currency, equivalent to about US$20,000, which is indicative of the situation. Although prices are stable, they have not fallen. An ordinary meal costs about US$3 or more. A hard felt sun hat, which sells for only 25 cents in the United States, costs about US$4 here. A bottle of beer costs US$1, an orange costs 30 cents, and a newspaper costs 12 cents. These are not rare items, nor are they black market prices. There has never been any control. There are very few brand new or almost brand new cars in Nanjing. Most are jeeps, military vehicles, cargo trucks of unknown age, and rickshaws. High food prices have led many civil servants to resign. When will China's economy finally bottom out? This is the most popular speculation in Nanjing today.</p>
<h3>各地通訊 縣級組織綱要 劃分兩期實施</h3>
<p>[Local Dispatches: County-Level Organization Outline Implemented in Two Stages]</p>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper in Zhenjiang] Because this province has fallen into enemy hands, local administrative and autonomous institutions have been devastated and destroyed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is actively reorganizing and restoring them after the recovery. However, due to the special situation in this province, the order in the counties south of the Yangtze River has generally been brought back on track, while most counties in northern Jiangsu are still occupied by the communist army, and the people are scattered and their homes are in ruins. It will take time to restore organizations at all levels. Therefore, based on the "Outline of County-Level Organizations" and the "Implementation Measures for County-Level Organizations," the Jiangsu Provincial County-Level Organization Outline Implementation Plan has been formulated, dividing the implementation into two stages based on the actual situation of the counties in this province that have been recovered and those that have not been recovered. This plan has now been submitted by the Department of Civil Affairs to the 50th Provincial Government Committee Meeting for resolution and implementation.</p>

<p>[Calcutta Unrest Unsettled; Nehru and Jinnah Condemn Rioters; Indian Interim Government Expected to be Formed Next Week]</p>
<p>[Compiled News Report] According to a United Press report, Congress Party Chairman Nehru flew back to New Delhi from Bombay on the 17th and met with Viceroy Wavell to present proposals for the establishment of an interim government. However, both sides remained tight-lipped about the outcome. The Viceroy's Office only issued a very brief statement saying that the two sides had held preliminary talks on the formation of an interim government and would continue the talks soon. According to a Reuters New Delhi report, based on current developments, the new Indian interim government will be composed of six representatives from the Congress Party, five representatives from the non-Muslim League, one Sikh, one Indian Christian, and one Parsi. The list will be finalized tomorrow and submitted to the joint meeting of the Congress Working Committee and the Parliamentary Subcommittee for review. It is widely believed that the organization of the interim government may be completed by the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>The riots that occurred in central Calcutta on the 17th resulted in many deaths and injuries. Arson, looting, and stabbings were commonplace. In the evening, fierce fighting between Hindu and Muslim crowds was still ongoing. The roars and shouts, the sound of breaking glass, coupled with the sound of gunfire from British military suppression, were as dense as linked beads, weaving together a symphony of terror. Most residents were holed up indoors, afraid to go out. Important agencies such as the Telegraph Office and the Post Office were heavily guarded by military and police. Unscrupulous people took the opportunity to loot stores. Police opened fire, and the streets were stained with blood. Some corpses had not yet been claimed. Rescue workers were extremely busy all day long. Viceroy Wavell and the administrative head of Bengal frequently discussed the matter on the phone, which shows the seriousness of the situation. On the morning of the 18th, clashes broke out again, and police opened fire to suppress them in several places, making the situation even more serious. Although there are no official statistics on the deaths and injuries in the past three days, the Calcutta Morning Post estimates that there have been more than 600 deaths and more than 2,500 injuries.</p>
<p>Both Congress Party Chairman Nehru and Muslim League leader Jinnah have unanimously condemned the riots and unrest. According to a French News Agency New Delhi report, Nehru said that the future of our country cannot be decided by hooliganism. Jinnah also said that he strongly opposed such violence, which is a criminal act, and those responsible for the bloodshed should be punished by law. Muslims are quite uneasy about this incident, as its consequences are likely to damage the reputation of the Muslim League. Political leaders in Bengal Province also held meetings and broadcast appeals for calm in order to maintain order.</p>
<p>Hindu and Muslim leaders held a meeting on the 18th to discuss the issue of restoring peace in the city. Teams holding the flags of the Congress Party and the Muslim League marched through the streets, urging people to "maintain peace and fraternity" and chanting the slogan "Indian People United." Nehru and Jinnah also personally went to various districts to urge the public to remain calm, but the situation in Calcutta remains extremely deteriorated.</p>

<p>[Compiled News Report] According to a United Press Tehran report, although the Soviet Union has officially denied the deployment of troops on the Iranian border, diplomatic sources say that the Soviet Union has concentrated 15 to 25 divisions, or about 115,000 troops, on the border between Iran and the Soviet Union along the Araks River. These troops are special mountain troops, deployed 38 miles east of the Tuzilv border area, 80 miles north of Tabriz. Each division has an average of 5,000 troops, with fewer members in mechanized divisions. While Soviet troops are besieging the city, an independence movement is taking place within Iran. According to a Reuters report, Sheikh, the leader of the Arab tribes in Arabistan Province in southwestern Iran, arrived here today en route to Cairo, intending to seek help from the Arab League to protect Arabistan Province from the oppression of the Iranian government. Sheikh has also filed a similar complaint with the Iraqi government. Sheikh said that he can no longer tolerate the rule of the Iranian government and will strive for freedom and join Iraq. Arabistan Province originally belonged to Iraq and is located next to Kurdistan Province, where the oil fields are located.</p>

<p>[Tass News Agency The Hague, 17th] According to Indonesian newspaper reports: People on the Indonesian islands celebrated the one-week anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Indonesia. Large-scale demonstrations and gatherings were held in major cities of Java, with slogans such as "Resolutely Defend the Republic" and "Strengthen Indonesian Unity."</p>
<p>[Reuters Batavia, 17th] Sjahrir declared: If Indonesians and Dutch continue to engage in combat behavior, causing resentment between each other, then negotiations to find a reasonable solution will be meaningless. Our dispute with the Netherlands seems to be intensifying. I deeply hope that the Netherlands will not change its intractable attitude. However, the recent remarks of Dutch officials seem to offer little hope. I think all parties concerned want to find a peaceful solution. This requires fairness and goodwill to make it a reality. If they continue to adhere to their prejudices, there will be no results. It should be understood that the Republic of Indonesia will not collapse on its own, nor will it be defeated by military action. Anyone who sincerely seeks a peaceful solution should not harbor the wish to defeat us.</p>

The Congress of Industrial Organizations is prepared to challenge the authorities' price control policies in mid-October. The Chrysler Motors factory union has issued a warning that if the government does not control inflation within six weeks, workers will again demand wage increases.

<h3>Two Major Groups Form Opposition: Many Hidden Obstacles in the Path of the Peace Conference; Vandenberg Quite Dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's Attitude</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] A New York Times reporter claims: The Paris Peace Conference concluded its third week of meetings on the 17th. In yesterday's meeting, invitations to Austria and Iran to attend and present their opinions were passed, first by a vote of sixteen to six, and then unanimously. According to a report from the Associated Press, Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber has already departed for France today.</p>
<p>Date of Next General Assembly Undecided</p>
<p>The date for the next plenary session of the Peace Conference has not yet been determined, but Chairman Wang Shijie previously announced that Albania, Mexico, Cuba, and Egypt will attend and present their opinions on Tuesday. After the issue of Austria and Iran's attendance was resolved yesterday, the Soviet delegation did not suggest preventing France from having the right to vote on the drafting committee for the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, or preventing the United States from having the right to vote on the drafting committee for the peace treaty with Finland. The Soviet delegation had previously raised these points in each of the drafting committees for the peace treaties.</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union Accuse Each Other</p>
<p>According to a report from Reuters, since the Peace Conference began, it has become clear that the participating countries have formed two opposing groups. U.S. Senator Vandenberg, summoned by Secretary of State Byrnes, departed for Paris today. Before leaving, he expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union, stating, "The Soviet side has consistently obstructed the investigation of major issues concerning Austria and Germany from the beginning, and I do not know what their intentions are." He also resolutely opposed disclosing atomic bomb secrets or abandoning atomic bombs as weapons until there were sufficient security guarantees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moscow Radio broadcast Davidov's "Current Affairs Commentary" last night, offering harsh criticism of the United States' latest 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and other ships soon visiting the eastern Mediterranean. The commentary claimed that the United States is moving toward world domination, and soon every country will be within the flight range of American planes, adding that what the United States values is not international cooperation but atomic bombs. Judging from the attitudes of all parties, the future of the Peace Conference is full of thorns.</p>
<p>France Calls for Persuasion to Cease Disputes</p>
<p>The French Radical Socialist Party's "L'Aurore" reported, "It is quite evident that the disagreement between U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is enough to endanger the Peace Conference. The United States opposes the Soviet Union's expansion of its power and attempt to control all of Europe for the same reason it previously opposed Nazi Germany's attempt to dominate Europe, not because of ideological differences. That is why French President Bidault requested the Peace Conference to cease disputes." Therefore, the Canadian representative's appeal to the five major powers to eliminate the state of division so that the conference can progress rapidly is indeed pertinent.</p>
<p>Disputes Arise Over the Issue of Adjournment</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse: There are widespread rumors in Paris that the Peace Conference will be adjourned so that the representatives of each country can go to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, but the Soviet delegation has openly opposed the adjournment of the Peace Conference and insists that if the Peace Conference cannot be concluded as scheduled, the United Nations General Assembly should be postponed. The position of the U.S. delegation is not yet clear, but it is said that they agree that the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland must be reviewed before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. As for the opinion of the British delegation, it believes that the Peace Conference and the United Nations General Assembly cannot be held at the same time, but while the representatives of each country are in New York, the committees of the Peace Conference can still be held as usual. However, this will inevitably cause some difficulties. If the heads of the delegations of each country do not attend the committees of the Peace Conference, it will be difficult to achieve concrete progress. The French delegation, summarizing the opinions of all parties, believes that the main task of the Peace Conference is to sign important treaties, and the United Nations General Assembly should be postponed accordingly.</p>
<p>Byrnes to be Visited by British Foreign Secretary This Week</p>
<p>South African Union Prime Minister General Smuts is expected to arrive here tomorrow to lead his country's delegation to the Peace Conference. In addition, U.S. Senators Vandenberg and Connally will arrive in Paris within days to strengthen the U.S. delegation. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will attend the Peace Conference starting next week. Next Monday, the committees will discuss the draft peace treaties, and given the different attitudes of all parties, fierce debates are bound to occur.</p>
<h3>Japan's Provisional Compensation Plan Under Consideration by the United States: Intended to Assist Economic Recovery in China and the Philippines; This Proposal May Be Submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] According to well-informed sources here: The U.S. State Department and Army and Navy authorities are currently considering a provisional compensation plan authorizing General MacArthur to allow Japanese assets to be immediately shipped to countries damaged by the war, but not exceeding 20% of the estimated total value of each industry. This plan may be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for discussion. The reason the United States put forward this plan is to utilize Japan's surplus materials as soon as possible to assist the economic recovery of China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Establish a Compensation Bureau</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese government is currently considering establishing a Compensation Bureau to handle the dismantling, packing, and transporting of approximately 10 million tons of industrial equipment, and to manage its records, as this equipment will be shipped out of Japan as in-kind compensation. This work is currently handled by the Central Liaison Office, but in practical implementation, special skills and experience are required, so a separate agency must be established, possibly directly under the Cabinet.</p>
<h3>Foreign Journalists in France: Paying Respects to the Battlefields</h3>

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Britain and the United States in an Article: Claims that the World Can Never Be Absolutely Equal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] "New Times Magazine" published a lengthy article accusing powerful imperialists in Britain and the United States of attempting to use United Nations agencies as tools for their expansionist policies, and stated that abolishing the principle of unanimous voting is equivalent to destroying the foundation of international cooperation. We must not deny that the support of great powers for peace is more important than that of small groups. For example, El Salvador can never be compared to Britain, and Luxembourg cannot emulate the United States. Therefore, in terms of the importance of supporting peace, the countries of the world can never be absolutely equal. The U.S. representatives in some international conferences have openly admitted that they have the support of twenty Latin American countries behind them. In this situation, how can one talk about the value of the "majority principle"? Therefore, the talk of equality is merely hypocritical.</p>
<h3>Nationalization of Labor Bill: Passed by the Philippine Congress; Chinese Overseas Merchants Affected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 17th Special Dispatch] The Philippine House of Representatives has passed the second reading of the Nationalization of Labor Bill. The bill was proposed by Congressman Teeson on July 17th. This bill has the greatest impact on Chinese overseas merchants here, as it stipulates that any privately-owned company or corporation in which the total salary of Filipino citizens employed accounts for 60% of the total monthly salary of all employees is not allowed to operate or engage in any buying or selling. Furthermore, the Philippine Senate has passed the second reading of the bill to nationalize public markets, which aims to completely drive out Chinese retailers in public markets.</p>

<h3>The Palestinian Problem is in a Stalemate: London Conference Expected to be Convened This Month; The United States Discussing with Various Countries How to Handle European Refugees</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] The Palestinian problem is still in a stalemate. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, Bevin did not attend the plenary session of the Peace Conference on the 17th and stayed at his hotel all day, consulting with Colonial Secretary Hall, who had just arrived from London. Jewish leaders are waiting for the British government's response to their initial proposals. Sea Minister Alexander, who came here to discuss the Palestinian problem with Bevin, departed for Paris on the 18th, and it is expected that the situation will develop in two or three days.</p>
<p>The Palestinian conference, which is attracting attention from all parties, will be held within this month, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London. A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the date will be determined after the seven countries of the Arab League and the Zionist Organization send their representatives. Some Arab countries have refused to attend the conference at the same time as Jewish representatives, so it has been decided that although Jews and Arabs will participate in the conference at the same time, they will be held separately in different locations. It is widely believed that this procedure will complicate the conference and take longer. However, the British government is prepared to extend the conference until a mutually satisfactory agreement is reached.</p>
<p>Illegal Jewish Immigrants Break Through British Blockade</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Jerusalem, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants sneaking past the British blockade continues to increase. According to an Associated Press dispatch, 1,400 Jewish refugees in Haifa were originally scheduled to be escorted to Cyprus on two troopships on the evening of the 16th, but this was canceled due to opposition. The refugees refused to leave their original ships, and thousands of Jews gathered to demonstrate, protesting the deportation of the refugees. In fact, the refugee problem in Europe is a whole serious problem. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated on the 17th that the U.S. government has begun direct negotiations with other countries (presumably Britain) or through United Nations agencies to facilitate the resettlement of European refugees. It is estimated that there are currently as many as one million homeless refugees in Europe.</p>

<h3>Puyi's Testimony is Important: Attracts Worldwide Attention</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 18th] The trial of the Far East International Tribunal is becoming increasingly historically significant due to Puyi's testimony. Puyi's concealment on the 16th, the conspiracies and machinations of Honjo, Itagaki Seishiro, and others to organize the puppet Manchukuo and force him to become a puppet were completely exposed, vividly and deeply impressing people. Because he has broken free from the shackles of the puppet emperor, he can speak freely. The situation was reported, and Puyi's speech must be completed in one week. At the moment, people all over the world are very optimistic about this.</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Tatar Strait: Turkey's Reply Delayed; Turkey Hesitates; Britain and the United States Will Formally Clarify Their Attitudes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Ankara: The Turkish government's reply to the Soviet Union's request to revise the Montreux Convention will not be sent out for the time being. This is because the Turkish government first wants to consult the opinions of countries directly related to the revision, and the opinions of these countries have not yet been formally expressed. However, it is generally observed that Turkey will probably reject the Soviet demands, because the content of the Soviet note is equivalent to canceling the convention and supporting the regional agreement, thus violating the spirit of the original convention. Moreover, the convention was signed in 1936, and its validity period is 20 years, and it should not expire until 1956. There is no reason to invalidate it at this time. The Soviet proposal should at least gain the support of another signatory country.</p>
<p>Also, according to a Reuters dispatch from London: Like the United States, the British Foreign Office is busy drafting a formal declaration clarifying its attitude towards the revision of the Montreux Convention. It is expected that the British government's statement will soon be submitted to Moscow and Ankara. The British attitude is that the Soviet Union's request for revision, as stated in its note, does not conform to the revision conditions originally stipulated in the convention. Britain believes that the revision of the Montreux Convention should be negotiated by all the original signatory countries. In addition, due to changes in the environment, it seems that the United States should participate, and signatory countries that have become former enemy countries, such as Bulgaria, Romania, and Japan, should be rejected.</p>
<p>As for the U.S. attitude, it can be seen in U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson's remarks yesterday. Acheson said that the United States will reiterate Secretary of State Byrnes' position adopted on November 7, 1945, on this issue. On that day, Byrnes outlined the United States' policy on the Tatar Strait, the main points of which are four: (1) The Tatar Strait must be open to merchant shipping from all countries under all circumstances, so as to prevent Turkey from using the strait to block enemy merchant shipping in the event of war. The status of the Tatar Strait should be equal to the Suez and Panama Canals. (2) The United States requires that the Tatar Strait be open to warships belonging to countries along the Black Sea at any time. (3) Warships belonging to other countries should be prohibited from passing through the strait, except for the number of tons stipulated in peacetime, or when a Black Sea country is specially permitted, or when warships are under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. The current treaty stipulates that the number of tons for warships of all countries outside the Black Sea to pass through is limited to 40,000 tons, but Byrnes hinted that new figures could be considered. (4) The United States will propose to "refresh" some points of the Montreux Convention, just as the United Nations mechanism replaces the League of Nations, and will abandon Japan from the place of signing the treaty. Comparing Byrnes' statement with the Soviet Union's main demands, it can be known that the United States will support Turkey and oppose the Soviet Union's demands. This is because the Soviet Union requires the establishment of Turkish-Soviet joint defense bases, the new convention is limited to countries along the Black Sea, and the United Nations mechanism is not mentioned. If the Soviet Union insists on its demands, a new tense situation may occur between the United States and the Soviet Union. The cruise of the U.S. 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and several other British and American warships in the Mediterranean cannot but give people the impression of a show of power.</p>

<h3>Nazi Germany's Secret Documents: Expose Plans to Invade Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Among the documents collected by Nuremberg U.S. Prosecutor Jackson for the trial, there is an important secret document signed by Hitler on July 16, 1940, revealing that Hitler had planned to launch an attack on England from the broad front line from Ramsgate to the Isle of Wight in August 1940. The order briefly stated: "Although Britain is now in a state of military despair, it still has no intention of surrendering. I have now decided to prepare to land in England if necessary. The purpose of this operation is to destroy the domestic bases of Britain's war against Germany, and to completely occupy it if necessary. The landing will be carried out on a broad front line, from Ramsgate to the west of the Isle of Wight, in a blitzkrieg manner, with the air force replacing the artillery's task, and the navy replacing the engineer's task. Before a full-scale landing, it must be decided whether to occupy the Isle of Wight or Cornwall first, and then decide on future actions. The results of this discussion should be reported to me immediately. I now reserve this decision, and all preparations need to be completed by August." The Battle of Britain began on August 8, 1940, and reached its peak on September 15. At that time, the British Air Force shot down 185 German planes in one day, and the German headquarters had no choice but to postpone its attack, and finally gave up.</p>
<h3>Japan and Italy Conspire to Invade</h3>
<p>Secret Document in Custody of the United Nations</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th] Former Ambassador to Italy, Horiguchi, submitted a secret document to the Japanese government on December 3, 1941, stating that Mussolini had approved Japan's plans to invade the Far East on the same day and told Horiguchi that Italy would not only contain the British fleet in Europe, but also be willing to declare war on the United States if Japan decided to attack the United States. The document is currently in the custody of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Soviet Rocket Plane Speed: Rumored to Reach 1,000 Kilometers per Hour</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] Pravda claims: The Soviet jet or rocket-propelled plane can maintain a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour (62,116 miles) for several hours. The Soviet people are extremely interested in the development of aviation, so the need for aircraft engineers and workers has greatly increased. (Note: The current world speed record is 606 miles per hour, which was created by the British Meteor jet-propelled aircraft last year. The aircraft is planning to make another official test flight to break the record soon.)</p>

<h3>The Father of American National Water Conservancy Projects: Senior Senator Norris (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Devoting His Life to Water Conservancy: Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[Knoxville, July 25th Dispatch] The masterpiece that is the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) in this southeastern mountainous region is not only an achievement for the United States, but for the world. The creation of the atomic bomb relied on the high-voltage power supplied by the TVA. To this day, the atomic bomb factory in Oak Ridge (outside of Knoxville) is still connected to the TVA's power engines. Americans have a kind of innocent, constructive enthusiasm, and sometimes, a very superficial sense of humor. Near the Norris Dam, there's a large roadside sign that reads: "Visit the 18th-century TVA." Out of curiosity, I asked my guide, Mr. Goreby, to accompany me to see it. It was a large wooden water wheel built in a mountain gully, which is called a wooden wheel water windmill in the Jiangzhe area of China.</p>
<p>The stream flowed down from a height, turning the wooden wheel, which was connected to the interior by a shaft, and could be used to pound rice and hull it. The Belgian Supreme Court Justice, Mr. Percy, who was with me, looked at it and didn't understand. Goreby asked me, "Do you have this kind of thing in China?" I said, "There are still many in the countryside, but you can't see them in the big cities." We both nodded and smiled. In fact, water windmills still exist in the Midwestern United States, especially in the valleys inhabited by Native Americans. Civilization is inherently progressive, and without the primitive 18th-century water windmill, there might not be the TVA of today. At the same time, human civilization relies on human effort, and this effort is arduous, a crystallization of the human society’s pursuit of progress. Professor Li Man of the University of Chicago gave a very long speech in Chicago this June,</p>
<p>introducing the achievements of the TVA. He said: "From 1927 to 1932, an Eastern European country completed a major project that attracted worldwide attention. That was the great dam on the Dnieper River. The completion of this dam was overseen by an 'omnipotent' dictator, so the project progressed rapidly and its effects were particularly significant. This kind of high speed is impossible in a democratic country with differing opinions. In the United States, there was also a great thinker who advocated for water conservancy construction for forty years, and only saw it completed before his death. This great American thinker was George William Norris. Without Norris, America would not have the TVA, nor would it have been able to create the atomic bomb so smoothly.</p>
<p>Without Norris, President Roosevelt's New Deal would not have been so brilliant. Without Norris, 18th-century water windmills would still be scattered throughout the deep mountains and valleys of Tennessee. The year President Lincoln called for the Civil War to liberate black slaves, Norris was born in Sandusky, Ohio. His family was poor, and he lived a life of hard work in his childhood. He received his education in Ohio and studied law after growing up. In 1885, when he was 24 years old, he traveled alone to Nebraska, where he worked as a lawyer. At that time, the United States was experiencing rapid social and economic development after the Civil War, and due to the success of the westward movement, there was a need for talent in all areas. The young Norris's talent</p>
<p>was soon appreciated by the people of Nebraska, and he was elected as the judge of the 14th district. In 1902, Norris was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in Congress as a Republican. From that year on, he began his forty-year parliamentary career.</p>
<p>In the House of Representatives in Washington, Norris was known as an upright and outspoken person. Although he was a member of the Republican Party, he firmly opposed party dictatorship. He believed that the interests of the country should be above the interests of the party, and he emphasized that the responsibility of a member of parliament was to the country, not to the party. The current Director of the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, former Mayor of New York, La Guardia, was a like-minded friend of Norris in Congress at that time. They jointly launched an "Anti-Party Boss Order Movement" to prevent a minority of the party from manipulating Congress. At the same time, Norris promoted a cooperative system in Congress,</p>
<p>advocating for agricultural loans to improve the lives of American farmers in the early 20th century. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, Norris was particularly interested in hydropower and water conservancy. He suggested that the state government of Nebraska lend money to farmers to develop the land in the west. The states in the western United States near the Rocky Mountains were originally very desolate. Norris advocated for the construction of the Pathfinder Dam on the North Platte River in Wyoming, to utilize hydropower on the one hand and develop farmland on the other. In the summer of 1912, Norris took a small trip. On the Columbia River, he saw the rushing water and the infinite potential power latent in nature, discarded on the ground without being utilized, and felt very sorry. He also saw that the farmhouses beside the river were still burning vegetable oil lamps, and felt even more嘆 about the contradictions of humanity. He wrote to his friend, saying: "I am 感嘆 God's grace, we have all failed to apply it. I must shout myself hoarse for these things, to make Americans realize the importance of water conservancy projects.</p>
<p>But I swear, if my plan succeeds, I must firmly oppose these benefits being monopolized by private individuals. This is God's universal gift to the American people, and it should be controlled by the government and universally beneficial to the people." Two years later, the plan for a hydroelectric power plant in the Hetch Hetchy Valley near San Francisco was passed by Congress. However, the plan to generate electricity from the Great Falls of the Potomac River in Washington was thwarted in Congress. Norris's position was very firm. He advocated that the nation's water conservancy should be state-run. He opposed the Potomac Electric Power Company's monopoly on the welfare of millions of citizens in Washington.</p>

<h3>The City's Restaurant and Catering Industry Holds a General Meeting, Demanding a Reduction in Banquet Taxes. A Resolution is Passed to Petition the Bureau of Finance to Reduce it to 10%. Representatives are Selected to Petition the Authorities Regularly.</h3>
<p>The members of the city's restaurant and catering industry association are divided into 15 groups including Cantonese, Beijing-Hangzhou, Sichuan-Fujian, Anhui, Ningbo, Muslim, Vegetarian, Shanghai South, Shanghai West, Food, Local, Yangzhou, Rice and Vegetable, Jiangsu and other groups, totaling 576 businesses. The association has been faced with several changes by the city's financial authorities regarding the banquet tax rate. Initially, it was an additional 20%, then collective apportionment, and now it is set at 20% of 120%, and the industry association was notified to have its members purchase designated invoices and meal tickets from the Bureau of Finance. If each customer purchases a meal ticket in advance and is not full, and needs to add rice or vegetables, the restaurant must collect the meal ticket and charge banquet tax accordingly, which has caused widespread opposition. The association held an extraordinary general meeting of all members at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. In addition to the representatives from the Party, government and police agencies, more than 500 members from various groups attended. The directors of the association, Liu Songtao, Hong Xizhang, Yang Yuquan, Zhou Dunxiang, Zhao Kaihan, and others served as the presidium. First, Chairman Liu Songtao gave a speech, roughly saying: "Today's meeting is being held at the request of the representatives of each group to convene an extraordinary general meeting of members. The reason for the call is that the representatives of each group feel that the industry is facing increasingly severe difficulties, and the constraints of taxes are also increasing. If this continues, the industry will inevitably decline. This is urgent. Please share your great insights and unite to overcome the difficulties together." Then Hong Xizhang gave a report, followed by speeches from the representatives of the Social Bureau, Gan Simin, the City Party Department, Bao Boyi, and the City Chamber of Commerce, Yu Yulin. After the speeches, the discussion began. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Petition the City Bureau of Finance to reduce the banquet tax to 10%, (2) Banquet tax should not be levied on non-banquets, (3) Penalties should be based on evidence of tax evasion, (4) Request the Bureau of Finance to send staff to collect taxes on a long-term basis, (5) Waive the use of unified invoices to simplify procedures, (6) All members who sell braised food retail should be exempted from taxation, (7) Music halls should be required to pay the same tax, (8) Each group will nominate two representatives to join the presidium to petition the authorities regularly. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>All Passengers on the "Beihai" Ship Disembark, Temporarily Accommodated by the UNRRA. An "Interesting" Interlude: A Pregnant Woman Gives Birth to a New Passenger on Board.</h3>
<p>More than one hundred passengers aboard the British Swire Shipping Company's "Beihai" ship were stranded.  Some ran out of funds and were unable to make a living after disembarking.  Representatives were sent to "UNRRA" twice on the morning of the 17th to petition for help, but without success.  After discussions between various parties, "UNRRA" sent seven trucks to the Swire Wharf yesterday to transport the stranded passengers to the UNRRA Yangshupu No. 2 Reception Center for temporary accommodation.  It is scheduled that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will send another ship on the 24th of this month to transport them north.  It is reported that the "Beihai" ship can set sail as soon as the Customs sends personnel to inspect and confirm that there are no more passengers on board.  The "Beihai" ship incident was also accompanied by an interesting interlude.  Passenger Li Shigui, along with his elderly mother, wife, and four children, boarded the ship in Shanghai to return to his hometown of Tianjin.  Since the ship was detained, Li had no spare funds, and his wife, Liu, was heavily pregnant.  With no relatives or friends, disembarking was inconvenient.  However, yesterday morning, before the "UNRRA" trucks arrived at the wharf, Liu gave birth on the ship.  The "Beihai" ship now had one more new passenger.  Since Liu had just given birth, it was inconvenient for her to travel by truck to the Yangshupu Reception Center, so she remained in the hold.  It is rumored that she may also receive relief from "UNRRA" and be sent to a hospital.</p>
<h3>Minister of Food Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xu Kan, Minister of Food, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday and arrived at Longhua Airport in the evening. After disembarking, he went straight to his private residence on Rue Ratard to rest. According to reports, Mr. Xu's stay in Shanghai will be very short, and he will return to Nanjing within a few days.</p>
<h3>The Police Bureau Will Regularly Conduct a General Survey of Citizens' Occupations</h3>
<p>In order to understand the details of citizens' occupations and to have statistics for reference, the municipal authorities have decided that the City Police Bureau will be responsible for carrying out the survey. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the bureau has ordered all sub-bureaus to inform their subordinates that they will conduct an occupational survey from the 21st to the 25th of this month. Each sub-bureau will be divided into groups to handle the survey, with each group consisting of two police officers and two voluntary police officers, who will work with the district and neighborhood chiefs to investigate the details. It is understood that the types of households for the occupational survey are divided into three categories: (1) ordinary households, i.e., ordinary residences, (2) business households, including commercial firms, factories, banks, cooperatives, and other business organizations that handle business, and (3) public households, including agencies, schools, and other public institutions. They will fill out forms to report and compile statistics.</p>
<h3>The French Consul General in Shanghai Holds a Cocktail Party to Entertain Chinese and Foreign Celebrities</h3>

<h3>The China Merchants Electric Tram Company Plans to Continue Operating Trams in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Merchants Electric Tram Company's exclusive operating contract for trams in Nanshi with the municipal authorities was scheduled to expire in August 1943. However, the trams were suspended on August 13, 1937, and during the period of occupation, the vehicles and tracks were dismantled and removed by the enemy, resulting in considerable losses. Recently, the company has planned to sort out the located vehicles and the recovered steel rails and iron poles in order to resume operations. It is currently petitioning the relevant authorities to extend the exclusive operating period by 30 years, in addition to the six years of suspension due to the war of resistance. It is reported that the authorities have not yet made a definite statement.</p>
<h3>High Tide Yesterday Afternoon, Overflowing Ditches in Low-Lying Areas</h3>
<p>There was a high tide in the city yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. Due to the backflow of the tide, there was some water accumulation in the low-lying areas and sewers, which did not hinder traffic. However, this month is the high tide season, so companies and businesses in the Bund area with underground facilities have paid attention to flood prevention measures. According to the predictions of the Dredging Bureau, there will be several more high tides this month.</p>
<h3>Suspected Embezzlement by Staff of the British Tramway Company: Falsified Deposits - Five Yuan Changed to One Hundred Yuan. Yao Wenzhong and Wang Songchen Arrested for Investigation.</h3>
<p>The British Tramway Company, which operates tramcars and trolleybuses on various routes, has a daily revenue of approximately 60 million yuan. The company's comprador, Hu Ziyu, is responsible for the safekeeping of the revenue, and Yao Wenzhong, a local, is in charge of managing the loose change, bundling and sealing it securely. Wang Songchen from the Huishan Wharf station in Tilanqiao assists in packing and transporting it. All daily revenue of the company, a large amount of money, is routinely dispatched to the Shanghai Municipal Bank in the name of the British Tramway Company, and then transferred by the Municipal Bank to the Central Bank for deposit. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the company has directly sent a total of 420 million yuan in national currency to the Shanghai Municipal Bank since February of this year, all of which were 100-yuan banknotes. Each bundle contained 100,000 yuan, and each package contained ten bundles. Because the bundles were sealed and placed in large wooden boxes, the Municipal Bank authorities, in order to avoid trouble, trusted the company and did not send personnel to count the money, and forwarded it to the Central Bank for deposit. Each trusted the other without error. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month, when the Central Bank deposited the money into the treasury, the hemp rope that was bundled around the money broke, revealing that there were 5-yuan banknotes inside. Subsequently, it was discovered that each bundle had the same situation. After statistics, it was found that there was a total shortage of more than 6 million yuan, so the bank refused to accept the money. The bank informed the Municipal Bank, which in turn informed the Tramway Company. The company's comprador, Hu Ziyu, believed that the difference was too large and reported it to the authorities for investigation. As a result, the aforementioned Yao Wenzhong and Wang Songchen were detained last night at 10:00 PM on suspicion of embezzlement and sent to the Huangpu Branch Bureau, which has jurisdiction over the case, for temporary detention and investigation. The bureau chief, Du Chun, has ordered Zhou Guanghui, the head of the judicial section, to send his staff member, Wang Shufan, to summon Hu Ziyu, the comprador of the British Tramway Company, to the bureau at 11:00 AM yesterday morning to inquire about the cause of the incident in detail, and is conducting a thorough investigation of Yao Wenzhong and Wang Songchen separately.</p>
<h3>The Number of Soviet and White Russian Residents in Shanghai: Accurate Statistics Still Lacking. Two Camps Clearly Differentiated Between "Red" and "White."</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] At this time and in this place, the reporter wishes to report on the current situation of the Soviet and White Russian residents in this city.</p>
<p>What is the exact number of Soviet and White Russian residents living in this city? This remains a mystery, as no organization has been able to provide accurate statistics. According to one official source, the number is estimated to be between 15,000 and 50,000 (a very wide range of uncertainty). According to the Soviet community's own estimate, it is over 20,000.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai people called the wandering White Russians "Luo Song Ren" (a transliteration of "Russian"), and often added two unpleasant words after that, with a somewhat derogatory meaning. Now, most of the White Russians have acquired Soviet citizenship. The Soviet government has provided various conveniences to naturalize these White Russians. The consulate's regulations for White Russians to obtain citizenship are extremely simple. As long as they provide documents proving that they were previously Russian people, or if they do not have such documents, two Soviet citizens can guarantee that they are Russian people. However, despite this, many White Russians, due to decades of life under the Tsarist regime, have deeply ingrained ideas. They do not agree with the policies of the current government, nor do they want to acquire citizenship.</p>
<p>Therefore, Russian organizations in Shanghai are divided into two distinct camps: the "red" "Soviet Compatriot Association" and the "white" "Russian Emigrant General Association," with a ratio of approximately three to one. The chairman of the former is Zifirov, and the chairman of the latter is Bogolov. There has been sharp conflict between the "red" and "white," especially in the ownership of church property, leadership of religious beliefs, and management of public services, all of which have been openly manifested. From the trend, the White Russians are in decline. Recently, Bogolov announced that his organization does not contain political functions, and is only an organization that unites those Russians who are not accustomed to Soviet legal systems.</p>
<p>The Soviet government does not force naturalized Russian émigrés to return to their country. On the contrary, many people have automatically requested to return to their country because they are finding it difficult to live here, and are in the process of applying for passports. More than a month ago, 59 helpless White Russian children were sent back to Soviet public institutions for care.</p>
<p>The scope of occupations of Soviet and White Russian residents is very broad. Most of them are employed by companies and organizations as engineers, technicians, leather workers, drivers, etc. In addition, there are also many self-employed people such as doctors and nurses, and then there are merchants and small workers. The number of unemployed people is not large. The "Compatriot Association" provides food and clothing assistance to them.</p>
<p>Currently, Soviet community activities are mostly concentrated in the "Compatriot Association" at 801 Avenue Foch, due to the difficulty of finding housing. They also run a primary school there, and recently plan to open a middle school that can accommodate ten classes of students. As for the White Russian side, other than the fact that they can often be seen at the church on the corner of Rue Corneille and Route Lorton, their other activities are very limited.</p>

<h3>Recalling the Fire on Yidingpan Road, More Than Twenty Sheds Were Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] A major fire broke out at Zhuanbang on Yidingpan Road last night at 6:00 PM, lasting for two hours. As a result, more than twenty sheds were destroyed, fortunately without causing any casualties.</p>
<h3>A Public Memorial Ceremony Was Held Yesterday at the Lake Society for the Late Senior Member of the Transportation Community, Wei Yifu</h3>
<p>Wei Zuomin (Yifu), a senior member of the transportation community, taught for ten years and was involved in politics for thirty years. He encouraged young people and was self-motivated, day after day, for decades. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly at his residence in Nanjing on July 15, 1946, due to overwork. When the news of his death arrived, his students and former colleagues were deeply saddened, and a memorial service was held at the Lake Society yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to express their condolences. Wu Shaoshu, Wang Zhengting, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Yang Xiaotian, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Bozhuang, Zhang Fang, Zhao Zukang, Zhong E, Xu Sizeng, Mao Qingxiang, Gong Xuesui, Wu Yunfu, Zhang Jingli, Tao Yishan, and others served as the presidium, leading the memorial service. The Guard Command Band attended the ceremony to play music. After offering incense and flowers, Qian Gongnan reported on Mr. Wei's life and deeds and read the eulogy. Subsequently, Wang Zhengting, Xu Sizeng, Zhuang Zhongwen, Wang Zhuyi, and others spoke about Mr. Wei's virtue. Among them, it was particularly moving to recall that during the Battle of Changsha, he always remembered the safe evacuation of the national railway personnel who remained in Xujiapeng. Subsequently, public memorial ceremonies were held by various public organizations. Chen Qicai (representing Shen Tianxin) and Pan Gongzhan presided over the ceremony for the Lake Society, Shen Zhongyi presided over the ceremony for the China Merchants Bureau, Rong Youlue presided over the ceremony for the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, Long Qingquan presided over the ceremony for the Shilongshan People's Governance and National Construction Association, Li Zuchen presided over the ceremony for the Sihai Society, Xiang Songpo and Li Bingqing presided over the ceremony for the Zhongnanshan Five Saints Mountain, Zhang Jingli presided over the ceremony for the Wen Society, Yang Xiaotian presided over the ceremony for the Ren Society, and Sun Yixiang presided over the ceremony for the Yi Society. The ceremony concluded at 4:00 PM. (The photo shows a portrait of the late Mr. Wei)</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Chongqing General Labor Union and Labor Association: Gu Zhenggang Sends Personnel for Thorough Investigation; Zhu Xuefan and Others Request Concrete Resolution</h3>
<p>Regarding the illegal seizure of the Chongqing Labor Association's facilities, representatives Tao Baichuan, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and their group, who went to Beijing to petition, have returned to Shanghai. Tao departed on the 17th, while Zhu and Zhou returned yesterday morning. Zhu announced the details of their Beijing petition, stating that the central government has taken the matter seriously. The Ministry of Social Affairs will dispatch Bao Huaguo, and the Organization Department will dispatch Peng Erkang, to Chongqing to handle the matter jointly. He expressed hope for a satisfactory resolution of their four demands, especially the immediate release of the arrested members of the Labor Association.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Chongqing General Labor Union's takeover of the Chongqing office and affiliated institutions of the China Labor Association has drawn considerable attention both domestically and internationally. To clarify the truth, this reporter inquired from relevant parties and learned that the China Labor Association is a cultural organization dedicated to studying labor issues and promoting labor welfare. It is not a labor union. It receives annual donations from the American labor sector ranging from US$500,000 to US$700,000, equivalent to tens of billions of Chinese currency. Local labor unions have repeatedly complained that its use of these funds is never made public and that it does not focus exclusively on labor welfare, deviating from the original intent of the donors. This issue was also raised during the National Political Council's general assembly last year, with council members criticizing the association for its opaque finances and activities exceeding its scope. At the recent Third Representative Assembly of the Chongqing General Labor Union, it was unanimously resolved that the Labor Association was using the substantial American donations for private extravagance and other activities, deceiving workers and hindering production. In addition to filing a lawsuit with the court, the General Labor Union also appealed to the municipal government for investigation and simultaneously took over the association's facilities. This is clearly a dispute between organizations. Since returning to Nanjing from Lushan, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs has sent personnel to conduct a fair and thorough investigation and handle the matter in accordance with the law. Regarding the reported arrests of Labor Association staff, it is said to be due to local security concerns, and the relevant authorities have been instructed to investigate and handle the matter promptly. Those who are not involved will be released.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Representatives of the China Labor Association headquarters, Zhu Xuefan, Tao Baichuan, and Zhou Xuexiang, met with Gu Zhenggang on the 17th to request a concrete solution to the Chongqing General Labor Union's takeover of the China Labor Association's Chongqing office and affiliated institutions. Minister Gu told reporters that this matter would be resolved concretely in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] This reporter met with Tan Zesen, the person in charge of the Chongqing General Labor Union, who stated that the takeover of the labor welfare institutions was at the request of 300,000 workers in Chongqing and based on sufficient legal grounds. If Zhu Xuefan and others attempt to slander or injure the union, the Chongqing General Labor Union and its 300,000 workers will spare no effort to contend with them to the end and await legal resolution.</p>
<h3>Cheap Sugar Sales Cause Widespread Complaints</h3>
<p>Regarding the distribution of subsidized sugar by the local dried goods stores, citizens have recently voiced many complaints, mainly because some stores intend to resell part of the sugar on the black market or refuse to sell it at all. According to a reporter from Hu Guang News Agency, most stores set the sales time for the subsidized sugar from 1 PM to 3 PM. In reality, sales often start after 1:30 PM and end around 2 PM, claiming that the "goods are sold out". Some stores delay the sales date, initially claiming the goods have not arrived, and only reluctantly sell a small amount on the afternoon of the final sales day. Many citizens queue up as early as 12 PM to purchase this cheaper sugar, with dozens or even hundreds waiting, but few succeed. The presence of "scalpers" further reduces the chances for ordinary citizens to purchase the sugar. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the authorities to find ways to improve the situation so that all citizens can equally enjoy this right.</p>
<h3>Soldier Kills Squad Leader, Flees with Weapon and Disappears</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 2:30 AM yesterday, Li Huanzhang, the squad leader of a special service squad in a certain regiment stationed in Yu Family Temple, Pudong, led four soldiers, Ye Shaolin, Yang Jindou, Li Zeliang, and Li Jintong, on patrol. While passing the corner of Xinma Road's Yu Family Temple deserted pavilion, he was suddenly ambushed and killed by the four soldiers. The bullets entered from his back and exited through his chest. His body lay stiff in a pool of blood. The soldiers fled with their weapons and disappeared. After being discovered by passersby, the incident was reported to Regiment Commander Liu and Bureau Chief Jia of the Yangjing Branch, who immediately dispatched officers to the nearby villages to apprehend the murderers. As of late evening, no arrests had been made.</p>
<h3>Fruit Store Apprentice Killed in Delivery Accident</h3>
<p>Zhang Ren, an apprentice at the Shun Kang Fruit Store located at 190 Zhongshan Southeast Road in the South City, was assigned to deliver goods by bicycle to Ningbo Road yesterday morning. Unfortunately, when he reached the intersection of Minguo Road and Yuanchang Lane, a ten-wheel truck, number 36823 of the Yilian Transportation Company, came speeding from behind. Unable to brake in time, the truck struck Zhang Ren, throwing him a considerable distance. He was seriously injured. Nearby officers urgently summoned an ambulance to take Zhang to Renji Hospital for treatment, but his injuries were too severe, and he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The driver of the truck, Zhang Xing, has been detained by the Yupiao Police Station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Baoxing Road Fire Brigade Holds Reinstatement Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shanghai North District is a vast area. The fire-fighting facilities were completely destroyed during the war. Yesterday, it was learned that local industrial tycoon Lu Guanshou and others have launched an initiative to reorganize the former Zhabei Section 4 Fire Brigade into the Shanghai North District Baoxing Road Fire Brigade, which has a total of three fire engines and more than 30 firefighters. One of the fire engines was donated by Mr. Lu. Yesterday was the date of the brigade's reinstatement ceremony, which was held at the brigade's headquarters on West Baoxing Road. In addition to military and police officers who came to guide the ceremony, representatives from fire brigades in various districts also attended.</p>
<h3>Chinese Seamen Receive Widespread Sympathy at International Maritime Conference; Victory Achieved Against Racial Discrimination; Labor Representative Wang Yalen Returns in Triumph</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] At the recent International Maritime Conference, the Chinese delegation fought against the discrimination suffered by Chinese seamen abroad, and the result was a victory. Chinese labor representative Mr. Wang Yalen recently returned in triumph from the United States. This reporter obtained much valuable information from him.</p>
<p>The 800,000 Chinese seamen are brave and adventurous men who are not afraid of a life at sea. The majority of overseas Chinese are seamen who travel far across the ocean. — "Overseas Chinese and seamen cannot be separated."</p>
<p>During World War II, a considerable number of seamen abroad served in the war. In various parts of Southeast Asia, due to the Japanese invasion, these Chinese seamen directly participated in the Allied operations.</p>
<p>However, our seamen abroad are discriminated against everywhere. This is a form of racial discrimination. With the exception of the United States, which treats our seamen equally, our seamen in England and the Netherlands (whose shipping businesses originally belonged to the British system) are subjected to all kinds of unfair treatment. In maritime conventions, Chinese seamen are openly listed under the special treatment category of "Asians and Africans." However, they cleverly phrase it as "to respect the customs and habits of Asians and Africans." Under such unfair conventions, seamen serving on British and Dutch merchant ships receive a monthly salary of only seven pounds (equivalent to US$28). Furthermore, the living space for Chinese seamen on their ships is only two-thirds that of white seamen. Therefore, some Chinese seamen deserted when British and Dutch merchant ships passed through the United States. This was not desertion, but rather resistance against unreasonable discrimination.</p>
<p>In fact, Chinese seamen are no less capable than their European counterparts. Their shipping company owners once told Mr. Wang Yalen: "Chinese seamen are very smart and hardworking. The only shortcomings are that they are not very obedient and not very cooperative." Mr. Wang replied bluntly: "This is due to your discrimination."</p>
<p>I Represent Justice</p>
<p>At this maritime conference, the Chinese delegation strongly protested against these unequal treatments and the discriminatory wording against colored seamen in maritime conventions. As a result, they achieved a glorious victory. American journalists provided sympathetic support. Newspapers such as the Seattle Star prominently headlined: "Chinese Plan Fight Against Discrimination." The photos of our representatives attending the conference (especially the labor representatives) often appeared in American newspapers, with headlines that were extremely sympathetic to the Chinese seamen's opposition to racial discrimination.</p>
<p>In the conference, naturally there were people who were jealous of us, but this was precisely because our voices were very loud in the meeting.</p>
<p>The full name of the conference is the "International Labor Conference Maritime Session." In terms of organization, it is a remnant of the "deceased" League of Nations, but due to practical needs and the continued vitality of the maritime agency worldwide, it still exists. This was the 28th session. It is said that it will belong to the United Nations Organization (U.N.O) in the future.</p>
<p>This conference held a preparatory meeting in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, in November of last year. Our delegation's fight against racial discrimination had already begun at that time.</p>
<p>The official meeting began on June 10th in Seattle and lasted for three weeks, with many all-night sessions. The United States, as the host, was extremely hospitable, making all the hundreds of delegates very happy.</p>
<p>Decided on Seamen's Treatment</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation consisted of 14 people: Government representatives Bao Yiguo and Li Pingheng, labor representative Wang Yalen (Secretary of the Chinese Seamen's Union), capital representative Yue Zuofu, and the remaining ten were advisors or secretaries.</p>
<p>The conference was divided into many subcommittees. We participated in the wage subcommittee, the ship equipment subcommittee, the seamen's social insurance subcommittee, and the food subcommittee.</p>
<p>As a result, the international minimum standard for seamen's wages has been set at 16 pounds per month. The minimum living space for seamen is 22 square feet per person, not including dining areas. However, regarding wages, representatives from India and Malaya requested that they not be raised too high, because if they were raised, shipping companies would be unwilling to hire Indian and Malay seamen. It is said that their work ability is relatively poor, mainly because they are too lazy.</p>
<p>It is said that the atmosphere at the meeting was very tense, with the British and American sides facing off sharply. They competed fiercely for maritime control. The Chinese representatives, for the sake of the entire country's interests, were united externally, which is commendable. However, one thing made the Chinese representatives seem to be losing value every day at the meeting: the increasing spread of civil war in China. I think overseas Chinese in distant lands must feel the same way.</p>
<p>British and American Seamen's Clubs</p>
<p>In Britain and America, seamen are highly valued because they both value maritime hegemony. Many enthusiastic members of society donate money to build clubs for seamen to enjoy themselves. Because after a long period of seafaring, they should receive some comfort. Secretary Wang Yalen visited the American seamen's welfare services and seamen's education programs and gained many referenceable systems. In the American seamen's clubs, sometimes many women who support seamen's welfare accompany the seamen to dance and drink, but there are fixed times. At the end of the dance, these dance partners or wives leave the seamen first, and once they leave the club, they are no longer responsible for providing comfort and put on a stern face, not recognizing each other. This is very interesting and illustrates the importance that the United States attaches to seamen and its meticulous care for them.</p>
<p>There is a seamen's training school in New York, founded during the war, that trains seamen in stages. The facilities are very complete. In addition, there are official seamen's unions and labor-run unions. The former is the United Seamen's Service (U.S.S), and the latter is the Seamen's Service (S.S). Both institutions are constantly improving the welfare of seamen.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Express Dissatisfaction Through Remittances</p>
<p>As mentioned above, "seamen and overseas Chinese cannot be separated." Secretary Wang also conveyed some opinions of overseas Chinese in the United States to the reporter. Currently, overseas Chinese in the United States are in a golden age. The level of prosperity has never been seen before. However, the situation in the country makes them feel depressed at all times. They are not satisfied with the Communist Party's cruelty and recklessness, but they also hope that the government officials' corruption can be eradicated. Their love for their motherland comes from the bottom of their hearts, from sincerity. They are very concerned about the remittance issue because they are very dissatisfied with the Chinese official banks handling overseas remittances. Sometimes the letters arrive, but there is still no news of the remittance. Now many of their funds are transferred through Hong Kong, which is a very regrettable leakage! In fact, the overseas Chinese in the United States today are very wealthy, averaging $200 per person per month, but the government has not handled the procedures for remitting funds back to China properly.</p>
<p>Finally, I will report on the current situation of the Chinese Seamen's Union: Its headquarters are in Shanghai, and it is currently handling the seamen's repatriation work. Abroad, it has eleven branches. The New York branch was originally called only "Association" and was not a formal legal labor organization under American law. After the negotiations by the Chinese labor representatives this time, it has been renamed the New York Office of the Chinese Seamen "Union." In this way, the legal status is very different. Now, many overseas seamen are returning to China. Many of them are returning on the ships that our country recently purchased from the United States. More than 5,000 returning seamen have registered with the General Labor Union, and the Seamen's Union is finding ways to place them in jobs. The union has established a repatriation committee specifically to handle this matter.</p>
<p>People who love freedom love the sea and love the seafaring life. We wish the Chinese seamen who travel across the ocean a bright future!</p>
<h3>Maigen Road Freight Station: Average Daily Throughput Exceeds 4,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] The Maigen Road Freight Station is the transportation hub for both the Jinghu and Huhang Railways. The authorities of both lines acknowledge this. In fact, no other station on either line is busier than Maigen Road in terms of freight transport. The throughput of the Maigen Road Station is probably one of the highest in the country's railways. Recently, news came that the two railway administrations have drafted a plan to greatly improve the Maigen Road Station and make it a most perfect freight station. This reporter made a special trip to inquire with Mr. Hou Huohua, the Deputy Director and Transportation Director of the Railway Administration. Director Hou was not very clear about the matter. He only knew that six kilometers of track and three "platforms" would be added, at a cost of approximately 110 million yuan. The entire project depends on the bidding situation and may be completed in about three months or by the end of the year. As for other plans, Director Hou said, "They haven't been released yet."</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation of the Maigen Road Freight Station before the improvement, this reporter specially hired a car to go to the station. Because it had just rained that day, there was a large pool of water in front of the gate, making it difficult to walk through the mud. After finally passing through this "swamp," there was a storage yard, which was full of things, but it was surprisingly messy. Rusted and bent steel bars, broken wooden boxes that had been blackened by wind, sun, and rain were piled up everywhere. The traveling crane and some unknown machines were lying irregularly. Bricks and tiles were everywhere. If we were still in wartime, I would definitely think that this place had just been bombed.</p>
<p>The station master's office is located at one end of the only usable platform, number six. Inside, there are nine dilapidated desks. The walls, floor, and ceiling have long been dyed a dark gray by dust. A strange smell greeted me as I entered, and flies flew in swarms. It was dark inside, and the light was too poor. I met the owner here—Station Master Yang Wenbin. Station Master Yang accompanied me on a tour. He said, "The enemy's destruction over the past eight years has been too severe. Now everything feels insufficient. There used to be nine warehouses, but now there is only one. There are still twenty tracks for switching cars, but there is no platform to unload goods, so freight cars are parked randomly everywhere. As long as trucks can drive past, they (referring to the coolies) unload goods anywhere, which makes it particularly messy and irregular." More than a dozen barges were docked in the two rivers (excavated from the Suzhou Creek). The ships were loaded with bundles of relief goods from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), which were being transported ashore. According to Station Master Yang, "On average, more than 1,000 tons of relief materials from CNRRA are shipped out every day."</p>
<p>Since the return to peace, the quantity of freight has been increasing daily. Currently, the Maigen Road Freight Station ships out approximately 1,000 tons of passenger and freight goods daily and ships in approximately 2,000 tons of passenger and freight goods. Adding in the 1,000 tons of relief materials from CNRRA, the average daily throughput is over 4,000 tons. As a result, the warehouse situation is a big problem. Station Master Yang told me that warehouse number one is now occupied by the Jianghai Customs for storing enemy and puppet materials, warehouses number two and three were demolished by the Japanese army, warehouses number four and five are rented to CNRRA to store relief materials, warehouse number seven has also been destroyed, warehouse number eight is now divided into three parts, one part is used to store enemy and puppet materials, one part is rented to CNRRA, and one part is used by the station itself. Warehouse number nine is the largest and is now the material warehouse of the Logistics Department. The only warehouse that the station uses is warehouse number six, which is also a platform, but the lead sheet covering on top has rotted with holes, which can only block the sun. When it rains, it is the same as being outdoors. Station Master Yang also led me to visit a newly built automobile platform, which is only about the size of two double desks. Two sides are made of cement, with a loose layer of coal slag in the middle. When the reporter visited, a transport company happened to drive a three-and-a-half-ton empty Dodge truck, which was to be driven from this platform onto the train. Unexpectedly, when it drove to the middle of the platform, the two rear wheels sank into the coal slag and could not get out. The more the wheels turned, the deeper they sank. It took a long time to back out. Station Master Yang said with a wry smile, "I heard that the construction cost of this platform was more than 10 million yuan?"</p>
<p>There are a total of 136 service personnel at this station, including one station master, three deputy station masters, and one intern station master (a student from Jiaotong University). Under these harsh conditions, they work hard, seeking solutions when there is no solution, and maintaining this daily freight volume of more than 4,000 tons. This spirit is worthy of our commendation.</p>
<p>My visit ended around 6 PM. After shaking hands with the amiable Station Master Yang, I drove out of the messy storage yard and passed through the muddy pool of water. On the way back, I couldn't help but have fluctuating thoughts. I imagined what kind of freight station Shanghai, the largest city in China with the busiest freight transport, should have. But then I thought back to what I had just seen, and I couldn't help but feel lost.</p>
<h3>Navigation Bureau Orders Large Number of Ships from the United States; Opening of North and South Ocean Lines Can Be Realized Soon; Twenty New Ships Have Already Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter visited the person in charge of the local shipping industry to inquire about the current situation of the shipping industry in our country and the announcement of fixed shipping routes. According to him, the original tonnage of ships in our country before the war reached more than 500,000 tons, which were almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppet regimes during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, the government tried its best to order ships from abroad in order to restore the pre-war transportation capacity. At present, private shipping companies have more than 170,000 tons of ships. As of the 13th of this month, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) had a total of ten Liberty ships, sixteen Victory ships, ten N3 ships, five LST landing ships, ten LSM landing ships, six LCT ships, four YF large iron barges, eleven tankers, two escort ships, and one cement pontoon boat, totaling seventy-five ships. These were the ships of the enemy and puppet regimes that were returned to Shanghai after the victory and the surplus ships purchased from the United States. There are still nine passenger and freight river steamers and six tugs and small boats in Sichuan, totaling ninety ships, with a total tonnage of 235,810 tons. It is said that the company also has seven tankers and is selecting surplus ships, barges, pontoons, dredgers, etc. from the United States in the Luzon area, totaling more than one hundred ships. A portion is expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month. The combined tonnage should exceed the pre-war level. However, the reason why the shipping routes in various parts of the country have not yet been fixed and the transportation of passengers and goods cannot be smoothed is because of the busy transportation duties. Recently, private shipping companies have ordered sixty large and small ships from the United States, ranging from 500 tons to 5,000 tons, with a total tonnage of more than 100,000 tons. Twenty of them have already arrived in Shanghai, and the remaining forty are already on their way. Therefore, in a few months, the domestic shipping industry in our country can be greatly improved. As for the fixed domestic shipping routes, only the Hu-Ning, Hu-Wen, and Hu-Tiansheng Port lines are currently available. The reason why the main lines in the North and South Oceans have not been able to designate ships and set shipping dates is, as mentioned earlier, due to the limitations of transportation duties. However, in the future, the ships purchased by private companies from the United States will continue to arrive in Shanghai, and the difficulties in our country's shipping can be easily solved. According to this reporter's inquiry, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) is currently planning to open fixed routes in the North and South Oceans. The South Ocean routes are still waiting for our government to sign a trade and reciprocal treaty with the local governments, so it must wait for a while. As for the ships on the North Ocean route, they are currently being allocated. Once the transportation duties are slightly reduced, they can be implemented.</p>

They will be divided into four groups, each with ten theaters, and will screen over four weeks.</p>
<h3>Many Soldiers Ride Without Tickets; Railway Bureau Loses More Than 200 Million Yuan Monthly; Police Department Begins Investigation and Seeks to Curb the Practice</h3>
<p>Today, soldiers riding trains without tickets has become a serious problem on the Beijing-Shanghai railway lines, with 700 to 800 people daily. Assuming 10,000 yuan per person, the railway bureau loses 7 to 8 million yuan daily, totaling over 200 million yuan monthly. Therefore, since the 11th, the police departments of both lines have been dispatching personnel to investigate. The number of soldiers riding without tickets in the past five days is as follows:</p>
<p>(Date) (Soldiers without Tickets) (Number of Tickets Purchased)</p>
<p>11th 701 217</p>
<p>12th 755 267</p>
<p>13th 549 278</p>
<p>14th 1070 407</p>
<p>15th 865 219</p>
<p>Total 3940</p>
<p>Total 1388</p>
<p>Observing the above figures, the extent of soldiers riding without tickets is evident.</p>
<h3>Soldiers Without Tickets Permitted on Slow Trains</h3>
<p>A Datong News Agency reporter inquired with the police departments of both railway lines about this matter. According to Commissioner Zhou of the department, the department, considering its responsibilities and in order to reduce the bureau's intangible losses, has decided to strictly curb the practice of soldiers riding without tickets. From now on, regardless of military rank, those who do not comply with the railway bureau's regulations will be asked to take slow trains. If the number of people is too large, the railway bureau can attach carriages for soldiers to ride in, which will provide mutual convenience for both the railway bureau's administration and passenger travel.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Soldiers: Four Categories</h3>
<p>Subsequently, the reporter learned the actual situation from other sources. Soldiers riding trains can now be analyzed into (1) active duty soldiers, (2) discharged soldiers, (3) soldiers' dependents, and (4) impostors posing as soldiers. Although a few will purchase tickets after being persuaded, the majority are active duty soldiers. Discharged soldiers, due to their living conditions, often cannot afford to buy tickets and often travel with three or four dependents. They ride not only special express trains but also gasoline trains such as the Shanghai-Hangzhou West Lake train and the Beijing-Shanghai Triumph train, which require assigned seating. This results in regular passengers often having tickets but no seats. This situation should be urgently improved to ensure order.</p>
<h3>Treating Trachoma, Preventing Tuberculosis, Red Cross Promotes Work</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Since the victory, the Chinese Red Cross, with the assistance of the American Red Cross, has been actively recruiting members and expanding its services in order to become a leading national charitable welfare organization. The association currently has five branches in Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. Recently, it has been cooperating with the American Red Cross to launch a national medical program, with two main focuses: first, treating trachoma, which is prevalent among Chinese students, by establishing clinics in major cities across the country this autumn. Second, cooperating with health bureaus and tuberculosis prevention associations to promote tuberculosis prevention and control efforts. Since its establishment in May, the Shanghai branch has also been actively engaged in work, achieving repeated success in assisting health authorities in launching epidemic prevention campaigns, piloting mobile service stations, providing free medical care to the Youth Army, and distributing condensed milk to tuberculosis patients. Recently, it has been striving to expand its clinics, add consultation rooms, and improve equipment in order to serve the poor and sick. The fees are only 100 yuan for registration and initial consultation and 50 yuan for follow-up consultations, with medical treatment completely free of charge. As a result, patients from far and near flock to the clinic.</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Pickpockets Arrested on Trolleys</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Sichuan North Road Police Precinct recently arrested a large number of trolley pickpockets, including Jin Yanlin, Jiao Yonggui, Zhou Minggao, Yin Tugeng, Fan Deyi, and more than ten others. Since the opening of the Hongkou Swimming Pool, the number of passengers on British Route 1 and Route 11 trolleys has increased, and the number of pickpocketing cases occurring daily has also surged. After receiving reports, the precinct dispatched plainclothes officers led by Section Chief Zhou Nan to investigate on the trolleys. They successively arrested more than ten repeat offenders, who confessed after interrogation. They are scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning today. The precinct also recently cracked a case involving repeat offenders who specialized in stealing vehicles, including Zuo Dahu, Zhang Changgen, Wang Longjiang, and Pan Gaoyuan, among others. A large number of tricycles, bicycles, and chartered cars were recovered. Some have already been claimed by their original owners, and the remaining vehicles are waiting for the owners to claim them.</p>

<h3>Northeastern University Preparatory Class; Students Boycott Exams and Leave School; Zang Qifang Indicates Registration and Exams Still Permitted</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Over 5,000 graduates from the Japanese-occupied period of Manchuria, after registering for the Northeastern University preparatory class, refused to take the exams. Subsequently, they petitioned the headquarters in the name of Northeastern refugee students and requested relief. Director Xiong provided 30,000 yuan in circulating notes for relief and explained that they should not refuse to take the exams without reason. If there are other circumstances, they will be handled after verification and consideration. Zang Qifang, the special envoy of the Ministry of Education, explained that the students' levels were uneven and their ages differed greatly, causing great difficulties in teaching. The students' refusal to take the exams has caused chaos. Currently, in addition to the 60 students who remain in school and have been examined, the students who boycotted the exams and left school are still permitted to register and take the exams. The enrollment quota is tentatively set at 4,000.</p>

<h3>Private School Fee Standards; Chairman of the Secondary and Primary School Joint Association Releases Statement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Since the Shanghai Private Secondary and Primary School Joint Association recently decided on the tuition and miscellaneous fee standards for this semester, the teachers and staff of various schools generally consider them appropriate, while students' parents have some concerns about their ability to afford them. A reporter visited Jiang Jizhou, the chairman of the association, who released the following statement: "The tuition and miscellaneous fee standards set by the association this time are 80,000 to 120,000 yuan for primary schools, 120,000 to 160,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 160,000 to 200,000 yuan for senior high schools. The following regulations are also in place: (1) Each school's free enrollment quota must not be less than 20% for primary schools and 15% for secondary schools. (2) These tuition and miscellaneous fees include all miscellaneous fees such as books and sports. (3) School office procurement expenses are based on 25% of total income in principle, and must not exceed 30% at most. If each school charges the minimum amount of the above standards (80,000 for primary schools, 110,000 for junior high schools, and 160,000 for senior high schools), and the free enrollment and distribution standards meet the above regulations, and the number of students per grade reaches 45 (according to the Education Bureau's statistics for the last semester, the average number of students per grade was 44.2 for primary schools and 42.1 for secondary schools), with 1.5 teachers and staff per grade for primary schools and 2 teachers and staff per grade for secondary schools, then the monthly salary of teachers would be approximately 240,000 yuan for primary schools, 290,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 350,000 yuan for senior high schools. Although this salary level is slightly higher than that of municipal schools, it is still lower than that of bank and company employees, as well as carpenters, painters, and printing workers. We believe that if we want to improve educational effectiveness and improve the quality of teachers, we must first increase teachers' salaries so that teachers not only have a stable life but also have the surplus to engage in further study and leisure. In reality, the number of students per grade in each school is often less than 45, the free enrollment quota exceeds 20% and 15%, and the repair and procurement costs are also quite large. If we want to maintain the above salary standards for teachers, we must slightly increase the above fees to compensate. Even if a few schools charge the highest amount, and the number of students per grade is still above 45, then the monthly salary of teachers would be around 350,000 yuan for primary schools and 400,000 yuan for secondary schools. For teachers who bear the responsibility of educating the next generation of citizens, this treatment is not excessive. At a time when the social economy is exhausted, there must be many students' parents who cannot afford these tuition and miscellaneous fees. We hope that each school will increase the number of free and reduced-fee enrollments so that no student is denied education due to high fees, which would benefit both teachers and students. Regarding the school's economic disclosure methods, the association already has a resolution from the last semester."</p>
<h3>National Xiamen University to Recruit Overseas Chinese Special Students; Quota Increased from 15 to 60; Application Deadline Extended to September 15</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xiamen] National Xiamen University, in order to facilitate overseas Chinese children returning to their motherland to enter university, has established regulations for overseas Chinese special students, recruiting 15 students each year. Any child of overseas Chinese who has resided abroad for the past two years and has a high school diploma, certified by the Republic of China consulate in the place of residence, can apply to be an overseas Chinese special student. They can first enter the school for a trial period. After one or two years, they can take a make-up entrance exam and, if they pass, become regular students. This is very convenient for overseas Chinese children. In order to develop overseas Chinese education, the school has increased the quota from 15 to 60 students. The original deadline for applications was August 1 each year, but recently, in view of the inconvenience of transportation after the war, the school has extended the application deadline for this year to September 15.</p>
<h3>Dangshan Exam Takers Cannot Return Home</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Gentry Meet to Discuss Relief</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou] There are a large number of students from Dangshan who came to Xuzhou to take exams for Jiangsu College and various secondary schools. Because over 20,000 Communist troops besieged Dangshan on the night of the 10th, and the defending troops broke through on the morning of the 12th due to lack of ammunition and reinforcements, Dangshan was captured, and transportation was cut off. The students cannot return home, and the travel expenses they brought have been exhausted, making food and lodging a problem. Some exam takers are temporarily lodging in open freight cars at the North Station every day, a pitiful sight. On the 13th, the local gentry in Xuzhou convened a meeting at the Ninth District Commissioner's Office to discuss emergency relief measures. It was resolved to request the Xuzhou Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association to provide prompt relief. It is reported that they have been approved, and the students from the county who came to Xuzhou to take the exams and cannot return home have been designated to register at the Provincial Xuzhou Middle School on the 15th, bringing their exam admission tickets, in order to gather them regularly and distribute relief funds.</p>
<h3>National Education Conference; In Order to Complete Ministry of Education's Work Plan; Possibly to be Held This Winter or Next Spring</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing] The Ministry of Education's various departments are preparing new work plans for all levels of education in the 36th year of the Republic. The Ministry of Education's Vice Ministers have invited section chiefs and above to hold meetings at the ministry in recent days in order to revise and pass them, to serve as the basis for future implementation. This newspaper's reporter recently visited Zhu Jingnong, the Vice Minister of Education, who stated that the education work plans of the Higher Education, Secondary Education, and National Education departments have been discussed in detail. The Social Education work plan and the Mongolian and Tibetan Education plans are currently being discussed. Because these matters relate to the guiding principles for education in the coming year, the discussion is thorough. However, the plans still need to be sorted out by the responsible departments after the meeting and approved by the minister before they can be finalized. The content cannot be revealed at this time. The reporter asked Vice Minister Zhu: Recently, the Higher Education Conference has discussed many important cases. Regarding the reform of all colleges and universities, the previous meeting stated that it was decided by a few people and could not be finalized. It is necessary to gather opinions from all parties, and there is a trend towards convening a National Education Conference. Will the National Education Conference be held this year? Vice Minister Zhu said that it has not been considered yet. If it is necessary, and the restoration of each school is smooth and transportation is unimpeded, it may be convened at the end of this year, but it is too early to say for sure. A reporter asked a certain person in the education sector, who said: After the victory, the Ministry of Education has been working intensely to organize and promote education at all levels. The new education plan for the 36th year must also be finalized and implemented. The administrative organization of universities and the adjustment of departments, and the revision of the curriculum; the separation of secondary education, normal education, and vocational education, and the curriculum standards also need to be revised. Although the five-year plan for national education has been circulated twice for implementation, few provinces and cities have raised funds and implemented it as scheduled. The promotion of social education and the use of radio and television education are the most urgent needs.

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Various Trade Associations to Report Last Year's Profit and Loss Status in Order to Resolve the Profit Tax Issue; More Than Half of the Associations Have Reported</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request for exemption from the 34th year's first-class profit-making enterprise income tax and the emergency period excessive profit tax, but it was not approved. However, the government has also expressed concern about the difficulties of industry and commerce, so it has simplified the tax collection methods in order to resolve this backlog of cases. The industrial and commercial delegation to Beijing made another appeal, and the competent authorities indicated that they would strive to simplify the procedures, but hoped that industry and commerce would not delay any longer. In order to speed up the inconvenience of the tax collection process, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already been sending letters to various trade associations, starting to investigate the profit and loss status of various factories and firms at the end of last year, planning to compile statistics to see the actual affordability, and preparing to openly discuss with the competent authorities. Since the return of the delegation, the work cannot be delayed, and it has been urging various associations. More than half of the city's 200+ trade associations have already reported the survey forms. According to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, this is purely for the convenience of industry and commerce and to assist the government, and the time cannot be delayed any longer. It will stop collecting forms immediately. If the direct tax bureau sends personnel to conduct on-site audits for those who have not submitted the survey forms, they will have to listen to it. Well-informed sources said that the Direct Taxation Department has never let go of the collection of profit tax for the 34th year.

After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce completes the investigation work, it will set off for a general survey, so that the trend of tax evasion can be stopped. It also said that the department has sent personnel to Shanghai to supervise the progress.</p>
<h3>World Gold and Silver Issues Price Continues to Rise Due to International Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Mumbai, 17th] The Indian government has reduced the import tax on gold and silver to encourage imports.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Economist wrote that the reduction of the Indian gold and silver import tax will not actually allow more gold and silver to flow into India, because the problem in the past was not a tariff problem. Even after the current tariff is reduced, the silver price in Mumbai is about 80.5 pence per ounce, and the gold price is about 19 pounds per ounce. The price is still so high, so the wartime obstacles are not tariffs, but the export bans and import bans of other countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Mumbai, 17th] A major gold broker told Reuters today that the price of gold and silver is constantly rising due to the world situation. At present, countries that can use one-tenth of their gold and silver as their currency reserve are already rare. Currencies are inflating to astronomical figures, and it seems impossible to curb them. Therefore, even if the Indian government uses all means to curb the rise in gold prices, it is still difficult to have any effect.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 17th] Although the estimated demand for silver in the industrial sector this year is as high as 125,000,000 ounces, the Treasury Department has only sold 3,400 ounces so far. The government has 100,000,000 ounces of silver that can be sold, but the result is still so small because the official price sold by the government is 91 cents per ounce, while the market price is 90 3/8 cents. As a result, the government only buys very little and sells nothing.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Loan Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association Contributes Four Opinions</h3>

<h3>Brick and Tile Source Sees Smooth</h3>

<h3>Costs Too High and Transportation Inconvenient Tea Sales Cannot Develop Tea Merchants Hope the Government Will Buy or Subsidize</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, at the tea seminar of the China Export Commodities Exhibition, several tea merchants told reporters that based on the current cost of domestic new tea, it is impossible to promote exports. The market price of tea abroad is about 30-40% lower than the cost price of domestic new tea. Taking Keemun black tea as an example, the current cost of new tea is about 460,000 yuan per dan for high-grade goods and about 350,000 yuan for medium-grade goods. However, the current market price of black tea in this city is about 130,000 yuan per dan for high-grade goods and about 70,000 yuan for low-grade goods. However, this black tea is mostly old goods from 1941 to 1944, which cannot be compared with new tea. Generally, tea farmers believe that the ratio between the price of tea and the price of grain after the war is very different. Therefore, most abandoned tea and planted grain, resulting in a sharp decline in tea production. It is estimated that the current production is less than 40% of the pre-war production. Taking the 7 billion yuan tea loan plan for the Southeast region this time, the output is only 30% of the plan. On the export side, the annual export volume of Chinese tea before the war was about 1 million boxes. However, the total export volume in the first seven months of this year is less than 50,000 boxes. It is said that the demand for tea in Northeast Mongolia is very strong. If transportation is not hindered, the output of this small area in the Southeast region is not enough to cope with domestic sales, so there is no need to rely on exports. However, at present, the cost of the newly made tea is too far from the estimated estimate, so the new tea made by various tea merchants using low-interest tea loans has been shelved. It is heard that tea merchants also requested the government to adopt a subsidy policy to allow Chinese tea to be exported, or to purchase it according to the production cost of new tea when the industrial and commercial delegation went to Beijing this time. The tea merchants also said that the government can currently allocate a part of the profits obtained from imported materials (such as raw cotton) to subsidize the export of tea in order to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Changes in Foreign Exchange After Victory Compiled by the Newspaper Archives</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange rates have been newly revised. Our country struggled for eight years in a bitter war, and the people struggled on the line of survival for eight years. Everyone longed for victory and peace. Victory and peace have finally been achieved, but prices have risen even more sharply than during the war, and the suffering of the people has become even heavier. This change in foreign exchange rates will certainly affect prices, because foreign exchange and prices are inseparable.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Pacific War, with the fall of Hong Kong and Shanghai, our country's foreign exchange market also came to a complete standstill. The official rate of the Chongqing Central Bank was initially set at a ratio of one to twenty. Later, it was changed to one to twenty and one to five hundred. However, after the victory, all economic sectors were awaiting recovery, and import and export trade urgently needed to be restored. Naturally, new exchange rates had to be set. The issue of foreign exchange rates temporarily became the focus of discussion in the business community. Chairman Chiang also said at the first meeting of the Supreme Economic Council on November 26th of last year, "To achieve the goals of increasing the production of various industries, as well as other economic construction and development, the most urgent thing is to determine foreign exchange rates to stabilize finance." It can be seen that the government is also very concerned about this issue. However, the foreign exchange problem remained unresolved for a long time, causing many export factories to wait and see, and foreign trade to stagnate.</p>
<p>On February 25th of this year, the Supreme National Defense Council approved the opening of the foreign exchange market. It designated banks to buy and sell foreign exchange, abolished the exchange rate of twenty to one, and authorized the Central Bank to set new exchange rates and, based on the circumstances, supply or purchase foreign exchange, with US$500 million as legal tender reserves. This led everyone to guess the riddle of the new exchange rate. Finally, on March 4th, the Bank of China announced that the telegraphic transfer rate for US dollars was 2020 to one. At this time, the black market price was 2030 yuan, so the decision on the new exchange rate was close to the black market. However, this ratio is not as high as the multiple of prices. According to the price index, taking Chongqing as an example, it was 2373 times that of pre-war levels. The increase in the exchange rate, however, was less than 700 times. Although prices in the United States have also risen compared to pre-war levels, relatively speaking, the external value of the legal tender is higher than its internal value.</p>
<p>After the new exchange rate was announced, many people believed that the ratio was too low. Imports flowed in continuously, while export trade was unable to develop due to increased costs. This hindered the development of domestic industry and created the bad result of strangling the national economy. However, the exchange rate set by the government was not decided rashly; it must have been based on the established national policy. After the war, our country wanted to industrialize and encourage the import of means of production. Setting a low exchange rate could reduce the cost of establishing factories. If the exchange rate were set too high, the cost of importing many machines would increase, and large-scale factories would be unable to open. Although there are many small-scale factories in the country, raising the exchange rate to maintain these many small factories is a short-sighted view. However, after the exchange rate was decided, imports did increase, but they were not means of production such as machinery, but mostly consumer goods. At the same time, export goods stagnated. Domestic factories were unable to open, and prices continued to rise. The government thought very carefully when deciding on the exchange rate, but the result was the opposite, so it had to revise the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Opening the foreign exchange market was the government's first major action regarding economic issues after the war. However, this policy was neither completely laissez-faire, allowing it to develop freely, nor did it peg the fluctuating prices. This was the government's unavoidable method. It only hoped to prevent large fluctuations in the exchange rate through the use of equalization funds, controlling foreign exchange positions, and managing import and export trade through intervention. However, the government cannot completely control import and export trade, because US dollars are circulating in the market and can replace drafts. The number of US dollars in circulation before the war was not large, but after the victory, a large number of American military personnel came to China, bringing many US dollars. Although the amount of US dollars in circulation has increased significantly, many import traders have a large need for them. When the new exchange rate was announced, it was actually more expensive than US dollars, but many imported goods could not be purchased with foreign exchange, so they were paid for in US dollars. The demand for US dollars increased, and the price also rose, exceeding the exchange rate. Although the Central Bank's listed price has always maintained a ratio of 2020, US dollars have risen to over 2600 or 2700 yuan. The financial authorities absorbed US dollars to reduce the amount in circulation in the market, and also requested the US side to pay salaries in legal tender. As a result, the amount of US dollars in circulation in the market has decreased compared to before.</p>
<p>Business Investigation</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of Mint Production and Sales</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Our country's mint production is only a matter of the last ten years or so. Before the 15th year of the Republic of China [1926], the mint raw materials used in our country's industrial and medical sectors were entirely dependent on Japan. After the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], Taicang and Jiading and other places in our country began to cultivate mint. In the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936], the planting area gradually expanded to Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, Changshu, Hangzhou, Jiangxi, and the suburbs of Shanghai. It is estimated that the highest annual output in the country once reached more than 20,000 dan. Apart from a small portion of this product being sold domestically, nineteen parts of it were exported. The annual export value, in addition to our country's main export products such as tung oil, bristles, raw silk, and tea, etc., mint can rank fifth. From this, it can be seen that mint plays an important role in our country's export trade.</p>
<p>According to people in the mint industry, the period from the 26th to the 30th year of the Republic of China [1937-1941] was the golden age of our country's mint industry. It is said that only China and Japan produce mint in the world. During that stage, our country's labor costs were lower than Japan's, and the quality of our products also improved day by day. Therefore, for foreign sales, the annual export volume of menthol exceeded 2 million pounds at one time. At that time, the export price was about US$9 to US$10 per pound. The purchase price of mint crude oil at that time was about the price of one dan of rice per jin. Farmers were happy to plant and refine because of the generous profits, so production was amazingly high.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the Pacific War, foreign ships stopped sailing to China, and the export of menthol came to a halt. As a result, market prices plummeted. The price ratio of one jin of mint crude oil to one dan of rice had long been destroyed. Farmers stopped planting one after another. During the four years of enemy and puppet occupation, the menthol suddenly lost its foreign sales market, so although farmers in various places stopped planting one after another, the domestic stock was still quite abundant, and the supply was not felt to be in short supply. Especially after the war, various small and medium-sized new factories, toothpaste and tooth powder factories, etc. were established one after another, so the business of this street became active again, and the annual sales volume has gradually increased to more than 30,000 pounds.</p>
<p>After the victory, with the hope of restoring exports, various oil companies launched purchases of crude oil from various producing areas. Farmers in various producing areas also started planting one after another, but the market price of mint crude oil has recently tended to go downstream. The market price per jin is only 10,000 yuan, which is less than the price of two dou of rice. Moreover, the fuel required for farmers to refine one jin of crude oil costs 6,000 yuan, and the labor cost is 3,000 yuan. However, the price that vendors or manufacturers can pay farmers is only 8,000 yuan per jin, so farmers end up losing money as a result of producing oil. Vendors are also unwilling to transport it because there is no profit to be made. Therefore, the mint industry, which was about to rise, was frustrated again and was dying.</p>
<p>Mint products include menthol and peppermint oil. According to people in the industry, each dan of mint crude oil can extract about 50 pounds of menthol and 50 pounds of peppermint oil. In the 26th year of the Republic of China [1937], menthol was about 15 yuan per pound, and peppermint oil was about 7 yuan per pound. Currently, the market price of menthol is about 16,000 yuan per pound, and peppermint oil is about 7,000 yuan per pound, which is only a thousand times higher than before the war. However, the general price and wage indices have exceeded 5,000 times. Therefore, various mint factories are also suffering from the threat of high prices, high wages, and high interest rates. Among the eight or nine factories currently in operation, all are barely surviving. It is said that the operating rate is far less than 20-30% of pre-war levels. The raw materials currently used by the factories are still the old inventory. The new raw materials are too expensive. In terms of the current market price of menthol and peppermint oil, it is really impossible to adopt them. In terms of exports, several manufacturers and export companies in this city have launched them one after another since the victory. It is reported that after the war, various countries, such as the United Kingdom, India, and the United States, have the most urgent need for menthol. However, as a result of the current high general prices in the country, the proportion of the increase in the domestic market price of menthol is only a thousand times, but the price reflected in the foreign market is still too high. After the victory, the price offered by American importers to order menthol from our country was only US$4.5 per pound. Now, although it has been gradually increased to $8, most manufacturers still feel unable to export it. India's offer is higher, about 19,000 yuan in legal tender per pound. However, each import shipment to India must obtain a British import permit, so the procedures are complicated and time-consuming. The United Kingdom's offer also reaches 18,000 yuan in legal tender per pound. It is estimated that the exported menthol that has been traded successively since the victory has reached more than 600 boxes (60 pounds per box). The average transaction price ranges from 16,000 yuan to 18,000 yuan per pound. Among them, shipments to the United Kingdom and India account for the majority, and Switzerland also accounts for a small part. Compared with the pre-war export volume, it is incomparable.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, mint is simple in nature. Ordinary menthol with a melting point above 42 degrees Celsius, and peppermint oil with a concentration above 50 degrees and 60 degrees, basically meet the standards of export quality. Therefore, ordinary merchants can operate it. If the government can give it a helping hand at this time, the future of the mint industry will be promising. They pointed out that in the passive aspect, working capital loans can be appropriately released to various mint factories, so that the factories can promote the export of inventory in their hands as much as possible, and also purchase the crude oil inventory in the hands of farmers, and at the same time solve the pain of manufacturers and farmers. In the active aspect, efforts should be made to subsidize the export of menthol. It is estimated that based on the current production cost of crude oil, the menthol export subsidy price should be maintained at least at the price of 50,000 yuan per pound in order to stimulate farmers to reproduce. At the same time, it is hoped that the export tax on menthol will be exempted, and an import and export linkage system will be implemented. The import value will be allocated to the export of menthol in an appropriate ratio. Then, the future of our country's mint industry will be promising. (Canglong)</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Sources Obstructed, Meat Prices Rise in This City</h3>
<p>The bulk of fresh pork sources in this city has always been produced in Huaian and other places in northern Jiangsu. Since the goods from Huaian were cut off for some reason, Xinkou, which belongs to Jingjiang County in northern Jiangsu, is also a concentrated area for fresh pork exports. Recently, it has been obstructed by the Communist army's extortion and harassment, so the arrival of goods in Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce, and the selling price of pork has risen accordingly. Yesterday, Xin Xiaokang, chairman of the pig industry trade association, told reporters that the current price of meat in Shanghai is affected by the above, so the market price of live pigs has suddenly risen from more than 1,300 yuan per kilogram to 2,400 yuan in ten days. Retail sales in butcher shops require more than 3,000 yuan per jin, and the supply still cannot meet the demand. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. The crux of the problem is not only the obstruction of sources, but also the frequent inspections by the military and police along the way, which are a pain in the delay of time. Moreover, the transportation of live pigs is best done quickly. If the time is delayed on the way, and the pigs are suffocated in the cabin, there will be many deaths and heavy losses, so the merchants are afraid to move. At present, the fresh pigs arriving at the Wusong wharf rely only on a small number of pig boats from Zhanghuanggang and Renjiagang to supply the market. Efforts are now being made to reduce obstacles and smooth the sources.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Encourages Farmers to Plant Sugarcane, NT$500 Million Loan Established</h3>
<p>According to the customs' pre-war import records, the highest annual amount reached about 600,000 tons. Taiwan Sugar Corporation plans to start planting sugarcane this month. After 18 months, Taiwan's total sugar production is expected to increase to 300,000 tons. After this plan is achieved, it will gradually expand. The company plans agricultural goods in advance to encourage sugarcane farmers to promote planting and increase production, and also prepare a confidential opinion, negotiated by Taiwan Bank to hold a loan of NT$500 million. According to reliable sources, this loan has been approved, and its target is for farmers to plant 60,000 jia of sugarcane (each jia is about 1 hectare, equal to 16 mu). The Taiwan Sugar Corporation's farm plans 30,000 jia, and the maximum loan amount per field is NT$9,000. The annual interest rate is only 8%, and the repayment method will be deducted according to the market price when the sugarcane matures next year. Regarding fertilizers, the Taiwan authorities are in talks with the United States to purchase 50,000 tons of ferrous sulfate (worth US$3 million) for shipment to China one after another.</p>
<h3>Handling of Property Rights of Northern Received Mines, Unified Regulations Have Been Established</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] It is learned that the handling of property rights of mines received in the north has many difficulties and disputes. Now, unified regulations have been established. If the mine owner did not cooperate with the enemy and puppets during the war, all property rights will be returned to the original owner after they are cleared. If the capital was increased by the enemy and puppets during the period of occupation, this increased capital will be regarded as the state's equity. The factory owner must convert it into cash according to the price index compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and offer to buy it. If the equipment added by the enemy and puppets is machinery and equipment, its price can be calculated according to the current price minus depreciation, and it must also be purchased by the original owner. If the number of machines and equipment added is too large and the original owner cannot purchase it, then when using the machine, a fixed amount of rent must be paid to the government on a regular basis. In principle, the competent authority can give preferential treatment to industrial mines that have contributed to the war of resistance and restoration.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Sees New Prices Again</h3>
<p>Although the use of asphalt soap has come to an end, there are still transactions, but the number is not large. However, the candle market is in full swing, and the weather is still hot, so only high-quality goods can be used. Therefore, the price of Heben is still particularly high. The producing area has already sold it for 100,000 yuan, and the inventory is thin and new production is still far away, so people cannot help but be excited, and it seems that it is just beginning to flourish. However, in Jinlan and other places in eastern Zhejiang, although the number is not large, the price increase is not much. Moreover, the situation in Hankou is still the same. Because of the small number and low price, the market for exclusive use is preferred by the public. Judging from the markets in various places, the most vigorous is the Jiaxing area, where the price is increasing almost every day, which is also caused by the season. The Shanghai spot quotation has been set according to the market. Heben oil is 110,000 yuan, Neiping oil is 98,000 yuan, Duzhi oil is 96,000 yuan, Lian 油 oil is 92,000 yuan, Macheng oil is 90,000 yuan, and slightly less is 86,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Company Prepares Finished Products, Plans to Exchange Goods in Southeast Asia, Only Awaiting Government Approval</h3>
<p>The news that the export of cotton yarn has been lifted is recently very noisy. Regarding this matter, the Textile Construction Company first requested it from the government, and the Shanghai textile industry followed up to support it. The Tianjin textile industry also felt the same way. It is found that Southeast Asia has a great need for yarn and cloth. Lian Yingzhou, chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of overseas Chinese in Siam have sent telegrams. If the Southeast Asian market is not seized in time, the Japanese textile industry, which has recently resumed exports, will take the opportunity to take the lead. It is reported that a Dutch merchant ship will sail this month. The Textile Construction Company has prepared a batch of finished products and plans to transport it to Java and other places to exchange for ramie fuel to meet the needs of the Textile Construction Company itself. This method is awaiting government approval. If permission is granted, it will be the prelude to the lifting of the ban on yarn and cloth exports.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Relief Measures for the Housing Shortage, The Current Approach Still Does Not Work, Three Suggestions from the Real Estate Industry</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The reporter recently asked a person in charge of the Real Estate Trade Association of this city about how to solve the current housing shortage. According to the report, there are three ways to solve the root causes of the current housing shortage: First, landlords repair damaged houses. Second, rent municipal land to build houses. Third, select appropriate open spaces in the city and order the original owners to build houses. Regarding the repair of damaged houses, many houses in Zhabei and Nanshi districts were destroyed by artillery fire and bombing. If the owners repair and rent them out, it can also increase the supply of houses. It is also heard that in order to encourage owners to repair, the rent for the houses supplied after the repair will not be subject to the restriction of the rent standard multiple. However, the restriction in Article 8 of the revised Lease Management Rules, which prohibits the collection of more than one month's rent in advance, will make Article 5 of the same rules a dead letter. Article 5 stipulates that if a bombed or collapsed house can be repaired, the landlord may be ordered to repair and rent it out. According to the report, if the owner invests several million yuan to repair damaged houses, and only collects tens of thousands of yuan in rent per month, then he will lose hundreds of thousands of yuan in interest per month, and even the most foolish will not do it, so there will never be any hope of repairing damaged houses. It is now heard that the Real Estate Association has submitted a request to the municipal government for this matter, requesting that the new rules be revised. Regarding the rental of municipal land to build houses, it is said that the lease term is ten years. After the lease term expires, the buildings on the land will belong to the municipal government. Therefore, in order to encourage owners to build houses, the convenience of collecting rent at one time should be given. Regarding the selection of appropriate open spaces in the city and ordering owners to build houses, the convenience of collecting rent at one time should be given. Regarding the selection of appropriate open spaces in the city and ordering owners to build houses, if the original owner is willing to accept it but lacks funds, the authorities plan to find a way to make it easier to obtain low-interest loans from the Central Bank. Otherwise, the Real Estate Association can also come forward to cooperate in building houses, and the original owner can use his property as shares, sell them after they are built, and recover the cost of building the houses. He said that if the municipal authorities can eliminate various practical obstacles and make the owners interested in investing, then by promoting the above three methods step by step, the housing shortage problem in this city will be easily solved.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge, the biggest problem in the future of the real estate industry in this city is still the lease problem. Generally speaking, the owner is now in a state of having property but no rights, and not being able to control his own business. He has no right to use or profit from his property. And the owner must also bear deed tax, land tax, rental income tax, business income tax, stamp tax, and house tax. Since rights and interests are not protected and the tax burden is heavy, every person in the industry with insight has been throwing out the real estate in his hands as much as possible. It is estimated that since the victory, the market price of real estate in this city has fallen by an average of 40%. In order to revitalize the real estate business, the industry association has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for three points: (1) Organize a land bank as soon as possible. Before the bank is established, please order the four banks to approve mortgage loans. (2) Any rules and regulations that do not fall within the scope of the Land Civil Code and hinder the construction and repair of houses should be abolished as much as possible. (3) The house tax should be borne by the residents.</p>

<h3>The Key to Opening the Door to Success Collective Writing by the Newspaper's Interview Room</h3>
<h3>The Internationally Renowned Diplomat and Scholar, Wéi Huìqìng: Seventy Years of Experience, Only One Assertion - Studying to Save the Nation, Tranquility Conquers Worry</h3>
<p>Photo by Our Newspaper Reporter</p>
<p>Whenever the sun sets and a cool breeze arrives, in Zhaofeng Park or on the quieter western section of Fuxu Road, we often see a tall, slender gentleman with silver hair, leisurely strolling. Sometimes, a naive and elegant young girl quietly accompanies him, happy and peaceful. This old gentleman is none other than Mr. Wéi Jùnrén, a respected elder in the Chinese diplomatic world, renowned internationally.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been a place where talented people gather, but although Mr. Wéi is from Shanghai, he spent many years abroad. He represented the Republic of China in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and the Soviet Union, promoting international friendship and establishing many historical achievements. After the end of the First World War, he was an advisor to the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. In Geneva, he also exerted his full diplomatic skills at the League of Nations. Although the League of Nations did not take effective sanctions against Japan that year, the efforts of the Chinese delegation were not in vain. Based on the materials we can see now, we can already know that if then-US Secretary of State Stimson and Ambassador to Japan Grew had not still harbored illusions about the Japanese moderates (especially Grew's good friends Makino and Hirota), the League of Nations could have and would have been willing to take fairly severe steps. The few passionate accusations made by the Chinese delegation that year may have planted a seed for the Allies' assistance to us in World War II, and leading this accusation was Mr. Wéi.</p>
<p>In the fields of education and culture, Mr. Wéi's achievements are immortal. Before dedicating himself to the diplomatic world, he was already the "Director-General" (equivalent to the current president) of Tsinghua University. Afterwards, he also served as the chairman of the board of directors of Yenching University, Nankai University, Peking Union Medical College, and St. John's University. His students and protégés are truly spread all over the world! As for his writings, the magnificent English-Chinese Dictionary of the Zhonghua Book Company is also Mr. Wéi's masterpiece.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Wéi was "conferred a Jinshi degree and appointed a compiler in the Hanlin Academy" by the former Qing dynasty. The impression that such a title evokes in most people is usually something like "peacock feather and mandarin square badge," holding prayer beads, and wearing Beijing boots with white soles. How did he leap to become an internationally renowned politician and a most progressive mentor to Chinese youth?</p>
<p>I believe the main reason is that Mr. Wéi is a scholar.</p>
<p>Because even when he was extremely busy with government affairs, he often had a book in his hand, he not only grasped the spirit of the times accurately, but also had an accurate vision of what changes the world would undergo next. Books not only provide "history," but also provide "trends." A politician who can grasp the spirit of the times will not "grow old."</p>
<p>This year, Mr. Wéi is already sixty-nine years old, and he still reads at least one new book a week. I ask, how many of those so-called progressive youths in China who are content with shouting slogans and putting up posters are willing to put in such real effort?</p>
<p>Mr. Wéi once proposed the idea of "studying to save the nation," which is really derived from his decades of experience and is by no means intended to deliberately suppress the patriotism of young people. Before the incident, we were unwilling to put effort into studying Japan, so after today's victory, we feel that there are too few people who understand Japan – if we Chinese were to replace General MacArthur and his subordinates to manage Japan, what would the situation become? Now, how many people are putting effort into studying the Soviet Union? Rather than shouting a hundred slogans and putting up a hundred posters, it is better to read a book. Mr. Wéi's proposition ten years ago is still the most pertinent advice at this time when construction is beginning and materials are urgently needed.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Wéi's high character and integrity are also major factors in his success. When the Japanese invaders captured Hong Kong, although he disguised himself as a refugee and was in dire straits, he was still discovered by the Japanese army in Kowloon and immediately arrested. At that time, Lin Baisheng's "Zhonghua Daily" ominously indicated an ominous sign, saying: "These people have no way to go except to repent and participate in the peace movement." Behind this shameless threat was a full indication of the enemy and puppets' quite sinister intentions, but Mr. Wéi always conquered worry with tranquility, and faced the enemy with the spirit of "being unyielding to power," enduring four years of unbearable hardship!</p>
<p>Mr. Wéi was not the only "Hanlin Compiler" who was "conferred a Jinshi degree" by the former Qing Dynasty, but how many others had Mr. Wéi's vision and spirit?</p>
<p>Mr. Wéi will not "grow old"!</p>
<h3>From Department Store Apprentice to Minister of Economic Affairs: Wang Yunwu's Success Story</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yunwu, who was invited to head the Ministry of Economic Affairs as a non-partisan, non-factional, and socially prominent figure, is a great contributor to the Commercial Press, the creator of the Four-Corner Code Indexing System, and the chief editor of the Wan You Wen Ku (Universal Library). The simplicity and convenience of the Four-Corner Code saves a lot of time in looking up characters, and the compilation and printing of the Wan You Wen Ku enabled the establishment of many small libraries in the impoverished small towns and villages of Chinese society with extremely limited financial resources. These two things alone have left an indelible value in the modern cultural history of China. He is the only self-taught businessman in our country who has succeeded. His success in self-study and the rapid recovery of the Commercial Press after the "January 28th Incident" are both called miracles.</p>
<p>He did not attend middle school or university, and only received three years of old-fashioned education in a private school in his hometown of Guangdong from the age of eleven to fourteen. His father was a small businessman with very low income and could not afford more education for him, so when he left the private school at the age of fourteen, he was sent to work as an apprentice in a small department store. The difficult life of an apprentice stimulated his desire for knowledge. He took advantage of his free time at night to attend a night school and began to learn English. In just a few months, his English became quite impressive. At the age of sixteen, he decided not to waste his precious time doing trivial apprentice work. So he obtained his father's permission, left the small department store, and entered an English school run by a church. This was the only school life he had in his life. But the good times did not last long. After only six months, he left the school for some reason, and his English foundation was laid in this busy, short, and unstable life. At the age of seventeen, he boldly accepted an appointment as an English teacher in a middle school. Since then, he has been constantly self-studying other subjects, and it can be said that he has explored all fields of learning and read all kinds of books. He joined correspondence schools, attended cram schools, natural sciences, social sciences, civil engineering, law, French, and German. He worked hard and had considerable attainments in all of them. Whenever he studied a subject, he must first formulate a plan and purpose, and pay attention to application. He once said: "Studying without a purpose yields little results. Studying with a purpose but without knowing how to apply it in the future still has limited effects. Only by first having a purpose, especially feeling the urgency of the need, will studying in this way often yield unexpected results." This is his honest confession and experiential talk. This is the only way to his success in the future. The position of general manager of the Commercial Press gave him a good opportunity to develop his ambitions. He used his knowledge to match his extraordinary perseverance and implemented "scientific management." The implementation of a new system will always encounter some difficulties. The implementation of scientific management in the Commercial Press also encountered unexpected opposition at the beginning, which almost caused a storm. This was no different from a de facto trial by fire for the newly appointed general manager, but he remained calm and instead withdrew the order. This kind of measure was absolutely inconsistent with his usual strong personality, causing people to think that Wang Yunwu had compromised, softened, and failed. But later facts told us: This was not his failure, but precisely his non-obstinacy and adaptability.</p>
<p>During the "January 28th Incident," the Commercial Press's Zhabei Baoshan Road headquarters was bombed by the Japanese army, almost putting it in a state of decline. Wang used his spirit of never giving up to rebuild the Commercial Press in a short period of time. This is a manifestation of his perseverance. He said at the time: "If the enemy knocks us down and we don't try to rise again, this is a coward. If we fall once and can't get up, it is enough to expose the weakness of the nation. It would be a shame for the nation if a cultural institution claimed to be so." He also often said: "Dealing with difficulties is the greatest gift, and solving difficulties is also the best reward."</p>
<p>After the recent meeting of the National Economic Planning Commission, Minister Wang once told reporters: "We cannot just have plans, but we must implement every word in the plan." Past facts tell us: He is a man who does what he says and does not issue empty checks. Once, he humbly said: "I am now learning new textbooks." Yes, he advocates "learning for application." Then, what he is learning today must be how to reform all the outmoded habits in politics and economics. The reporter here sincerely wishes him good health and looks forward to his greater success in the future!</p>
<h3>Cultural Pioneer: Hu Shi</h3>
<p>Carrying the power of a loving mother, carrying the habit of diligence, carrying the tendency to doubt, he stepped onto the ladder of cultural pioneers step by step!</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shi, the pioneer of the New Culture Movement, despite some people saying that he has too much of a desire for officialdom, has his own historical position and academic achievements.</p>
<p>Hu Shi's father died when he was three years old. If it were not for his mother's virtuous education, it would have been difficult for him to have today's brilliant achievements in his life.</p>
<p>His mother became a bride at the age of seventeen, and became a widow at the age of twenty-three. Since then, she has lived a very painful life for twenty-three years. She placed all her hopes on this only child. She fought for him to have the opportunity to study, she taught him how to be a person, she was his loving mother and strict father, and she was also his benefactor. At that time, Hu Shi was studying in a private school. Other families gave the teacher an annual salary of two silver dollars, but his mother gave six dollars in the first year, and then increased it every year, finally reaching twelve dollars. This increased tuition fee was definitely not a waste, on the contrary, it was a kind of far-sighted "investment." Because at that time, the teaching methods in private schools were all so-called "reading dead books and memorizing dead books," and the teacher never wanted to "explain the books" to the students, but his mother was willing to spend more tuition to ask the teacher to "explain the meaning of each word and the meaning of each sentence." In this way, the explanation word by word and sentence by sentence laid the foundation for Hu Shi's lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Born in Shanghai, he returned to his hometown at the age of five and lived under his mother's teachings for nine years, receiving her great and profound influence. Often at the age of fourteen, Hu Shi left Jixi, Anhui. "A lonely child, all the protective gear he had was a loving mother's love, a little bit of diligence, and a little bit of doubt," Hu Shi finally came to Shanghai.</p>
<p>During the six years in Shanghai, he studied in four schools - Meixi Academy, Chengzhong Academy, China Public School, and China New Public School. He was a good student, and he can also be said to be a "bad" student. He was at the top of his class everywhere, and he was also punished by the school. He caused school unrest, and he also ran a school himself. During this period, like many young people at that time, Liang Qichao's articles gave him great shock and emotion. Especially after he read Mr. Liang's "The General Trend of the Evolution of Chinese Academic Thought," he admired it on the one hand, and felt that there were shortcomings on the other. At that time, he had the ambition to help Liang Rengong supplement it, and this ambition planted the seed for his later masterpiece "A History of Chinese Philosophy." However, the credit for his greatest contribution to the New Culture Movement, the advocacy of vernacular writing, must be attributed to a training period at China Public School. At that time, several of his classmates organized a Jingye Society and ran a "Jingye Xunbao" (Jingye Ten-Day Report) that wrote articles purely in vernacular, and invited Fu Junjian, who was nicknamed Dun Gen, to be the editor. Hu Shi often wrote articles for the Ten-Day Report. Fu Junjian sent him a poem saying, "You and I are heroes in the world, and know each other in writing as friends and teachers," which made Hu Shi feel flattered and received a lot of encouragement. The "Jingye Xunbao" published dozens of issues, which not only gave Hu Shi an opportunity to express and sort out his thoughts, but also gave him more than a year of training in writing vernacular. From then on, vernacular became a new tool for him. This new tool, in his own words, "enabled me to be a road worker in the Chinese literary revolution."</p>
<p>It is rare to have perfect people in the world, and a successful person's life does not necessarily take the right path all the way. Hu Shi is a good example. Some of the students of China Public School, dissatisfied with the school's measures regarding the school badge, agreed to drop out and organize a new China Public School. Hu Shi was also one of those involved. However, the new China Public School lasted for a year and finally dissolved due to the inability to continue financially. Hu Shi's ideals were hit, and at this time, his family's finances also fell into difficulties. In addition to sorrow and depression, under the influence of a group of frivolous friends, he fell. Playing cards, drinking, calling prostitutes, and doing everything in darkness. Fortunately, a turning point came at that time. One night, he was eating and drinking in a "Tangzi" again. He got drunk, sat alone in a rickshaw in the rain, and went back. After going out and getting in the car, he lost consciousness. When he woke up the next day, he saw that he was sleeping in the iron cage of the police station. His old leather robe was completely wet, and there were scars on his face. After asking, he learned that he had injured a policeman on the road after being drunk last night and was caught in the middle of the night. On this day, after Hu Shi was released and returned home, he saw the scars on his face and the mud on his body in the mirror. He couldn't help but feel remorse and remembered the sentence "Heaven gave me talent, which must be used." He thought: Am I, Hu Shi, finished from now on?</p>
<p>Is Hu Shi finished? No, Hu Shi was saved. From then on, he abandoned alcohol and sex and prepared for the government-funded study abroad examination with all his heart. He finally got the economic support of some friends and relatives and went to the United States as a government-funded student in the fifty-fifth place at the age of twenty.</p>
<p>In the United States, it is said that he initially studied agriculture. Probably it was a momentary impulse, and he had no interest in it at all. Later, he studied the fruits produced in California. There were no less than hundreds of species alone. He had to remember the scientific names one by one. Hu Shi finally felt that this did not suit his personality, and he changed his course and studied literature and philosophy. He was talented, had a deep foundation, and was diligent and eager to learn. He finally obtained the honorary title of doctor. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, he returned to China and became a professor at Peking University. This period was the most glorious stage of his life. Like a newborn tiger, he attacked all old culture and morality, setting off a huge wave in Chinese society. He advocated vernacular writing, wrote vernacular poems, and what is most admirable is his fearless spirit of fighting against the old forces. This spirit, several decades later, is certainly no longer manifested in him, but what is most heartbreaking is that the current general youths who are in the so-called era of vigor and strength still lack this spirit of daring to act!</p>
<p>The world is constantly changing, and people's thoughts and actions are also constantly changing. As he got older, Hu Shi gradually became interested in politics. He wrote "Essays on Civil Rights" to scold the government, and therefore lost his position as the principal of China Public School. He also published the anti-Japanese remarks fifty years later and was scolded by others. If Hu Shi is indeed interested in politics, then he has succeeded in this aspect. You think; four years as the ambassador to the United States, isn't that a good example?</p>
<p>This time, Hu Shi has returned to China and has returned to Peking University. He said that he will devote himself to being a teacher and a historian in the future. We also expect him to do so. China is vast, and the people are ignorant. Where is the new generation of "Hu Shi"?</p>

<h3>Chief of Shanghai Branch of the National Relief Commission Liu Hongsheng: A Milestone of Success</h3>
<p>Unmatched drive is concentrated within the entire being of Mr. Liu Hongsheng. If he says he'll do it, he does it. What others can do but are unwilling to do, he does. What others cannot do, he also does. Once he starts, he perseveres until completion. Mr. Liu relies on this extraordinary drive, having served as the Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for three years starting in 1931. Now, he shoulders the heavy responsibility of the Shanghai Branch of the "National Relief Commission."</p>
<p>This is truly a burdensome and arduous task. Without administrative funds, without warehouses to store relief supplies, and with concerns about mold, rot, and spoilage, he nevertheless took on the role. He is willing to take responsibility, values pragmatism, and emphasizes doing a little at a time. He demands efficiency and possesses a spirit of continuous improvement. He has experience in managing all kinds of enterprises. His own thriving businesses, both large and small, are milestones of his success.</p>
<p>"I am not holding an official position. I only know how to get things done. If I believe something is 'right,' I implement it immediately. If I believe something is 'wrong,' I oppose it immediately. Right is right, and wrong is wrong. I detest perfunctory actions, following old habits, and ambiguity." He spoke so frankly and directly while reporters and his sons-in-law sat around chatting. "I would rather lose my head or face a lawsuit; I will take responsibility."</p>
<p>Born in Ningbo, Mr. Liu Hongsheng possesses the spirit of enduring hardship and striving for self-improvement common among Ningbo people. His past fifty-nine years have been spent in constant "motion" and continuous progress through struggle. His tall, robust physique, his sharp mind closely aligned with the times, and his wide forehead etched with the wrinkles of vast experience, all reveal the marks of having weathered adversity.</p>
<p>Like every successful person, Mr. Liu's childhood was spent in less-than-luxurious circumstances. His father was an employee on a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship. A simple family naturally could not afford a lavish university education. Therefore, after completing his freshman year, he left Yenching University and found a job himself.</p>
<p>It was with the Kailan Mining Administration, a British company, when its business had not yet smoothly developed. Mr. Liu initially worked as an ordinary translator at Kailan. He quickly gained the trust of his superiors. Later, the British company leveraged his sales talent and solid credit to establish a Kailan Sales Office with him. Thanks to his efforts, factories and ships of all sizes along the Yangtze River used Kailan coal, and the business established a foothold. With the profits from the coal business, he founded his first factory: the Hongsheng Match Company.</p>
<p>The "Hongsheng Company" incident is a deeply moving scene. At that time, Mr. Liu was only twenty-four or twenty-five years old. From Qingming Bridge in Wuxi to Zhangzhu and Xushe in Yixing, all the brick, tile, and lime kilns in this area had replaced firewood with his inexpensive Kailan coal. However, this caused hardship for the local mountain people who relied on firewood for a living. Anger grew in their hearts. One day, when Mr. Liu was staying in Pushe Town, friends from the distribution point secretly informed him that over a thousand mountain people were coming to surround him, intending to harm him. To avoid implicating his friends, he moved to a teahouse. Early the next morning, forty or fifty angry farmers arrived. They condemned him for taking away their livelihood. Relying on his generous and flexible tactics and quick-witted and persuasive eloquence, Mr. Liu convinced the agitated crowd.</p>
<p>That scene deeply moved him. He realized that a merchant who only knew how to seek personal gain was without the support of the masses and might even become an enemy of the public. "I am determined to take from them and return it to them," he said. "I chose Suzhou, a hub of transportation, and established a match factory to provide a livelihood for the old, the young, the disabled, and the weak. This was my motivation for founding the factory."</p>
<p>For fifty-nine years, this has consistently been his motivation for initiating businesses. New factories and companies spring up like bamboo shoots after the rain. He successively organized the Huadong Mining Company to compete with the British Kailan coal. He accidentally discovered Hongji coal dust in Vietnam and immediately invented machine-made coal briquettes (Dazhonghua Coal Briquette Factory). He founded the Zhanghua Woolen Company, China Merchants Wharf Company, Huashang Shanghai Cement Company, China Enterprise Bank, and so on.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Hongsheng's businesses are all launched and managed based on outstanding and reliable credit. Financial capital has provided him with significant assistance. The global economic recession that began in 1930 was a major storm for Chinese industry and commerce, and Mr. Liu's businesses were no exception. However, with the support of his limited personal assets, although all the factories and companies were losing money, they stood firm. Because he exchanged credit for cash from the banking sector and then sold his personal assets to support his promise of always honoring his debts. The Belgian Consulate with its lush green trees on Route Pichon was one of the prices paid for supporting his credit more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>To prove his credit with numbers, starting in 1921, he was the first to apply modern accounting methods in various industries, hiring the British accounting firm Creasy, Son &amp; Wickens to audit his accounts. At the same time, he was also the first to apply scientific management (he dared to try anything new).</p>
<p>In the late autumn of 1937, following the government's relocation inland, he went to Hong Kong. At that time, some of his businesses in Shanghai faced a second major crisis, but he was never discouraged or despairing. With a persistent and unyielding fighting spirit, he developed new businesses. In Hong Kong, he established the Great China Match Company with friends in the financial sector. Its products sold well in Southeast Asia and as far as Canada.</p>
<p>In 1939, the enemy's claws tightened their grip on Shanghai. Regardless of the risks, he ordered his fourth son, Nianzhi, in Shanghai to smuggle out the massive machinery of four factories. Via Hong Kong, Haiphong, Yangon, and the Burma Road, overcoming numerous dangers, they arrived in Chongqing. There, he founded the China Wool Textile Factory, Yong'an Battery Factory, and Jianhua Light Bulb Factory. He also jointly established the China Match Raw Material Factory with the Ministry of Finance to produce phosphorus, potassium chlorate, and other chemicals urgently needed for the war effort.</p>
<p>After experiencing the bombing of 1941, material shortages, and transportation difficulties, his businesses remained stable as always. According to people around Mr. Liu, the hardship of the material environment in the Great Rear Area at that time was difficult to imagine without personal experience. Mr. Liu himself even slept with an umbrella because the house was leaking!</p>
<p>Now, after having served as the Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Director-General of the Match Monopoly Bureau, the government has finally invited him to shoulder the heavy responsibility of post-war reconstruction. Recently, the reporter inquired in that high-ceilinged and cool reception room of this successful man, "What is the secret of your success?" While tearing open a new copy of *Factory* (a factory management magazine) that had just arrived from the United States, he said, "Up-to-date." He said to the reporter in a humble but serious tone, "I cannot yet be called successful, so I cannot speak of secrets. It is simply that I like to constantly learn. The big problem with today's scholars is that once they leave school or get a job, they immediately abandon their studies. The world is constantly progressing, and we should constantly strive for progress."</p>

<p>Improving Sanitation in the Yangjing District</p>
<p>Dear Editor: The Yangjing District of Pudong is vast, with a population of 170,708 (statistics from the Civil Affairs Office in May of this year). Since the restoration, the administration of security, education, finance, land, and sanitation in this district has become increasingly standardized. However, based on the current situation, the most urgent and important step in the area of governance is sanitation administration. I will briefly describe the reasons.</p>
<p>Along the Pudong waterfront in this district, factories and warehouses stand in rows, shantytowns are densely packed, bustling markets have blocked ditches, and sewage is overflowing. In the open fields, temporary graves are numerous, garbage is piled up everywhere, and mosquitoes and flies are swarming. Poisonous candies and unclean drinks are hawked along the streets. Conscious patients have no access to medical care, and ignorant families rely on shamans who enter homes. Most pregnant women still rely on traditional midwives for delivery. Citizens disregard sanitation and are generally reckless. The number of patients is increasing daily, and the mortality rate is rising. Therefore, the promotion of sanitation education, the rectification of environmental sanitation, the promotion of maternal and infant hygiene, and the establishment of medical institutions are various aspects of sanitation work that urgently need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Secondly, water is an essential necessity of life and a major vector for spreading infectious diseases. Residents in this district drink unsterilized river and well water. Therefore, every year during the summer and autumn, gastrointestinal diseases are rampant. Cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and malaria are environmental diseases common in this district. The water quality in this district relies on sanitation agencies to find ways to improve it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, countless residents of this district leave early and return late, working on the west bank of the Huangpu River. However, there is no quarantine work at the ports on both sides of the river. If an epidemic occurs in this district, it could spread to the west bank of the Huangpu River in an instant. Therefore, sanitation administration in the Yangjing District should be considered as important as that in the districts of the west bank of the Huangpu River. Only then can the districts of the west bank of the Huangpu River accumulate accomplishments. This cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Based on the above three points, the citizens of this district should promote the rapid establishment of a sound sanitation administrative organization in the Yangjing District, hoping to improve sanitation within the district and enjoy the necessities of modern science. The governing authorities know that the city treasury is not wealthy and it is difficult to achieve this. However, they should consider the urgency of the situation, decisively overcome difficulties, make the greatest effort, and soon implement the planned program to have the Yangjing District Sanitation Office begin its work. What this writer is deeply worried about is the lack of a location in the area where thirty people can work. This is submitted for public review, hoping that local talents and predecessors can provide assistance to improve the public health of this district. (Pan Guangzhen)</p>
<p>Letter from the Municipal Health Bureau</p>

Our reply is as follows: This bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for instructions regarding the workers' request for an increase in the price of toilet paper sold in public toilets in this city. Once we receive instructions, we will order the cleaning services to notify them. Regarding the dispute between the public toilet paper sellers and the Baoshang Xingji Company, we have already ordered the cleaning services to formulate management measures and submit them for approval and publication based on the actual situation. We hope you will review and disclose this information." Addressed to *Shen Bao*, Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, August 13.</p>
<p>Two Meetings with Chen Guangfu: Talking About the Biggest Turning Point in His Life and Career</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Guangfu's achievements in his own life and career are a living history of success. Mr. Chen received a complete education, is methodical in his approach, and possesses perseverance. His insights are accurate, and his vision is profound. Most importantly, he has been able to apply his correct view of life to his career. All of this has created an unshakable foundation for him in the financial world today.</p>
<p>In order to learn about his experiences in his lifelong pursuit of business, the reporter specifically made two visits during his busiest office hours. He took the time to meet with me. The reporter raised many broad questions that were difficult to answer in an instant, and he answered them one by one without hesitation. His impression is that he is the same as he was fifty years ago. He faithfully and sincerely handed the key to opening this fifty-year history of successful struggle to the reporter within a short ten minutes, so that it could be passed on to every young person who has embarked on or is about to embark on the path of struggle.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen has had too many careers in his life. Here, let's first talk about his most concrete crystallization – the Shanghai Bank, which stands at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road. Therefore, the reporter asked the first question: "Mr. Chen, what was the biggest turning point in your lifelong career?"</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said that in 1911, he was still working at the Jiangsu Bank. Seeing that the financial circle was entirely dominated by foreign forces, he suddenly thought that to develop China's national resources, it was necessary to consolidate China's financial strength. What was urgently needed was a financial institution that could serve the nation and society.</p>
<p>On June 2, 1915, at the current location of the Yongda Bank on Ningbo Road, a sign for the "Shanghai Bank" was suddenly hung up above a two-bay storefront. The capital was only 100,000 yuan, and it specifically promoted small savings deposits. At that time, many people thought this was a risky adventure, an experiment. However, Mr. Chen, who was confident, did not think so. He believed this was the initial realization of his plan.</p>
<p>As time went by, the Shanghai Bank moved forward systematically. It has gone through many economic ups and downs and numerous financial storms. The Shanghai Bank has not only stood firm but its reputation has also grown steadily. Today, the capital of the Shanghai Bank has expanded to 10 million yuan. The original location has expanded into a magnificent seven-story building occupying the entire street front. The total amount of deposits has broken the record of 27 to 28 billion yuan. It has had eighty to ninety branch offices across the country. Now, after the restoration, it has reached more than fifty branch offices. The number of employees has increased to more than 1,500. Today, the Shanghai Bank has clearly stood out and stands at the forefront of modern commercial banks in China.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen is not complacent with the achievements of the Shanghai Bank today. He earnestly said that the expansion of banking institutions and the repeated addition of personnel is not a success worth flaunting. Running a bank is a small matter, but the principles of being a person are a big matter. The most important thing in running a bank is credit, and the most important thing in being a person is benevolence and righteousness. The word "benevolence" has the meaning of two people becoming one. This clearly shows that any view cannot be judged subjectively. The main thing is to take into account the views of others. The financial business is a social undertaking. If society feels the need for the financial business, then this financial business can take root. Otherwise, there is no need to talk about finance at all.</p>
<p>When talking about the purpose of life, Mr. Chen believes that it should be to constantly move forward, constantly create, and constantly learn. He said that in the past fifteen years, he has been to the United States four times and Europe twice, receiving help from many friends and predecessors, reading many good books, and adding much new knowledge, which has made him feel that he should have an objective and detached view when dealing with any problem or thing. In particular, when studying financial problems, it is not enough to simply have a lot of contact with the financial sector.</p>
<p>He said that one of the great pleasures of his life is traveling. Precisely because learning has no end, he has the ambition to wander among every famous mountain and river in China and the world, "traveling thousands of miles and reading thousands of books." Cultivating oneself while doing things can reduce the control of the environment. He believes that this is the best way to arrange life. The development of China Travel Service's business today at least reflects Mr. Chen's general purpose in life.</p>
<p>The reporter also inadvertently asked Mr. Chen which contemporary great man he most admired. He unhesitatingly mentioned the late former US President Roosevelt. He said that he had met President Roosevelt four times and felt that President Roosevelt was a scholar-official who could write and do things. He believes that President Roosevelt's greatest success was his unique insights and outstanding talents, which made those who opposed him or agreed with his views willing to devote their loyalty and wisdom to a common cause.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is now sixty-six years old and his ancestral home is Jiangdang, Zhenjiang. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, he followed the government to the rear. He successively served as an economic envoy for the government several times, negotiating loans in the United States. The most recent time was in October of the year before last, when he attended the International Trade Conference as the chief representative of our country. In addition, during the War of Resistance, his main duties included serving as the Chairman of the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the Chairman of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. Currently, in addition to serving as the Chairman of the Shanghai Bank, he also serves as a trustee of Jinling University, West China University, and China Vocational School, and as a standing director of the Central Bank, a standing director of the Bank of China, and a director of the Communications Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Yongli Chemical Company, Dasheng Third Factory, China Cement Company, and Baofeng Insurance Company, as well as a standing supervisor of the Central Trust Bureau.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers</h3>
<p>— Medicine and Health</p>
<p>(1) Hemorrhoids and Ulceration</p>
<p>Zhou Liangju asks: I suffer from external hemorrhoids. There is a nodule the size of a peanut growing on the outside of my anus. It is usually painless, but when it flares up, it is weak and painful, oozes yellow fluid, and the surrounding skin ulcerates. It is inconvenient to sit and walk, and it is only slightly better when I lie down. I am currently around thirty years old, and my physical condition is still considered healthy. It flares up when I am overworked. I would like to ask: (1) What is the best method for a complete cure? (2) Besides surgery, are there any special medicines for injection or topical application? (3) Is "hemorrhoid cream" effective? (4) Are there any oral medications?</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor of Medicine Tang Renjin]: (1) A radical surgical procedure should be performed by a surgeon. (2) Anusol suppositories may be worth trying. (3) Unclear. (4) There are no other oral medications besides common stool softeners.</p>
<p>(2) Granulation Tissue Proliferation</p>
<p>Jin Zhensheng asks: Last summer, my wife suffered from a growth the size of a silver dollar, the nature of which is unknown. Is it related to health? Can it be treated with surgery? There was a lot of heat, and after it healed, red flesh protruded, and the marks have not faded. It has never recurred since, but the affected area has been growing over the years. It used to be a small piece, but now it is like...</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor of Medicine Tang Renjin]: Based on the condition you described, it is likely to be granulation tissue proliferation. You should consult a surgeon for removal.</p>
<p>(3) Cancer Rupture</p>
<p>Shen Yanyuan asks: My mother is in her seventies. Last spring, a small pupil suddenly appeared behind her ear. After the doctor used a mixture of "Antuodian" and pure sour treatment, it was ineffective. Later, a friend introduced her to use "Enpeiming" produced by Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, which specializes in the treatment of cancer, but after more than a hundred injections, it was ineffective. Instead, it expanded to the size of a teacup mouth and ruptured and leaked fluid several times. The newspaper recently reported a new American invention of an effective cancer drug. I don't know what the name of the drug is? Please indicate the treatment method.</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor of Medicine Tang Renjin]: You can try radium needles or X-ray treatment.</p>
<p>Two Teachers Impart Knowledge Tirelessly in the Park: Wu Jianhong</p>
<p>Giving lectures in parks has been around for a long time. Mr. Zhao Jingzhai, a lecturer in Fuxing Park, and Mr. Lu Buru, a lecturer in Linsen Park, volunteer to lecture to the public on *Guwen Guanzhi* (Anthology of Classical Chinese Prose) and practical writing, without receiving any subsidies or rewards. They get up early every morning from six to seven o'clock to lecture while it doesn't interfere with their jobs, year after year. At first, I had doubts whether there really was this kind of volunteerism and how admirable it could be, especially during the severe cold and hot summer months, they do it every morning and never skip a day. Before, during the enemy-puppet period, they were interrogated, suspected of having a background or playing a role. After several investigations, they were found to be upright and honest, and the doubts were cleared up. Now, even though the weather is hot, those who are listening to the lectures are sweating profusely, and the lecturers' wipes are wet. If it rains, they may get sick. Now, the students who are listening to the lectures plan to ask the authorities to add pavilions. The authorities are promoting literacy campaigns and public education, and park lectures have been beneficial to the public in the past. I hope the authorities will follow public opinion and add park pavilions to meet public needs.</p>
<p>Lost and Found</p>
<p>Seeking Square Wallet: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, after finishing my work at the United Press, I took a US military vehicle to Jiangwan Airport and discovered that I had lost a square wallet containing my United Press service pass, US military Jiangwan Airport pass, and identification (with photos). It is difficult to reissue this pass. May I borrow a corner of your newspaper to disclose this information? It is useless to others who might pick it up, but it is quite troublesome for me. I hope you will make it convenient for me, and I am deeply grateful! If the person who finds it returns it, I will offer a reward. Respectfully submitted by Fan Jiakang, Telecommunications Department, United Press. Address: 9 East Zhongzheng Road, Phone 82176.</p>
<p>Seeking Autograph Book: I lost a red hardcover autograph book around 9:00 PM on the evening of the 4th at the tram stop at North Sichuan Road and Haining Road. The first page has the words "Yuan Yunfen." I was entrusted by a friend to return it to their classmate named Yuan. I accidentally lost it on the way. I hope that the finder will send it to Mr. Zhao Xiaofeng at 8 Sanyuanli, Qiujiang Branch Road, North Sichuan Road (3rd floor) for safekeeping. I will offer a small reward to express my gratitude. Or please send a letter to the above address, and I will personally visit your residence to thank you. Li Wei respectfully, August 6.</p>
<p>Fake Medicine Deceives the World; Fellow Patients Beware</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I suffered from onychomycosis in April and May of this year, infecting three fingers on my right hand. When I first discovered it, I immediately used "Powerful Goose Root" to rub it. After rubbing four bottles in a row, not only did I not see any effect, but it got worse. The nails became hollow and fell off. In this situation, the products of the "XX Pharmaceutical Factory" are purely deceiving the world, which is very painful. I would like to ask you to disclose this in a corner of the social services column of your newspaper to prevent readers from being victimized. Zhushangde, Qintong, Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Thank You, Mr. Mingzhi</p>
<p>The other day, while visiting Fuxing Park, I lost my notebook and business cards. There were many memorandums in the notebook. Now, Mr. Mingzhi found it and mailed it back, saving me a lot of trouble. I am deeply grateful. I apologize for not being able to visit because I do not know your address! I hope you will reply to the Hongqiao Sanatorium. Respectfully, Xue Zhi</p>

<h3>Exploring the Battle Situation at Yangzhen Pass - Interview with General Huang Baitao - Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan, Yangzhou Dispatch for This Newspaper, 5th</h3>
<p>As the battle situation unfolded favorably, the morale here gradually rose. In particular, the displaced refugees had a sense of joy blossoming in their hearts, telling everyone they met that their hopes of returning home were now within reach.</p>
<p>To express its gratitude for the meritorious service of the 25th Division of the garrison in repelling the Communist army and thwarting its attempt to occupy Yangzhou, the "County Provisional Assembly" of Yangyi specially raised 120,000 National Currency on the 31st of last month to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers of the division, and sent a respectful telegram to General Huang Baitao, the division commander, to pay their respects.</p>
<p>Experienced in Battle, Resourceful and Courageous</p>
<p>To express our respect for General Huang and, at the same time, to explore for the displaced refugees how long it would take in terms of time for the Northern Jiangsu battle situation to have a greater and clearer development, both temporally and practically, yesterday (the 4th), around 3 PM, just as "the scorching sun was like a fiery furnace," the reporter, along with Mr. Hang Zhou, a special correspondent from this newspaper, went to the headquarters of the 25th Division, stationed in the south of the city, to visit General Huang, who had been firmly seated in the central command, directing operations day after day.</p>
<p>Beforehand, I only knew that General Huang was a famous general who had risen through the ranks, having graduated from military academy, and was known for his resourcefulness and courage; he was also an armed comrade valued by Chairman Chiang. Afterward, I came to understand that General Huang was also a military man with a wealth of general knowledge and was very talkative.</p>
<p>Rambling Conversation about National Affairs</p>
<p>The conversation began with national affairs, and it was General Huang who started it. It was very clear that General Huang was a military man, but he was very concerned about the country's politics, education, and even governance. Perhaps because of his concern, he was very worried! He said, "If the Communist Party continues to disregard the interests of the nation and the people, and insists on putting the interests of the party first, hindering all the government's plans to build and revitalize China, then in this state, even if the United States wants to help its friend China, I fear it will ultimately see China as a friend that cannot be helped. For ourselves, we would be a shameful friend!"</p>
<p>Next, he explained that China's education, economy, and other construction, in all aspects, lacked a foundation. For example, he said very clearly, "The educational level of the Chinese people is far too low compared to any strong nation! And education is the foundation of a nation."</p>
<p>Social Darkness, People's Suffering</p>
<p>In this way, he continued, "The entire society is full of darkness. Even relief efforts are rife with corruption. The day before yesterday, the Yangzhou office of the Refugee Relief Association was reported to be preparing to embezzle 200 bags of flour. I received the report and rushed over to investigate, and was shocked and disgusted. I am a 'supervisor' of the Relief Association, and I don't care about anything else; if this kind of thing happens again, I will definitely arrest them and deal with them!" Finally, he added, "Refugees are already suffering in the eighteenth layer of hell, and there are those who want to embezzle from these suffering people. You can see how dark society has become!"</p>
<p>Mr. Hang Zhou then asked, "Is the director of that office surnamed Xie?"</p>
<p>General Huang said, "I heard that this Mr. Xie is alright, but his subordinates are not!"</p>
<p>Mr. Hang Zhou added, "I also heard that there is this phenomenon: one refugee can get more than ten refugee certificates."</p>
<p>Reducing Food Intake for Relief, Refugees' Benefactor</p>
<p>"Yes! The truly poor sometimes don't receive relief, and the Baojia chiefs also engage in embezzlement..." General Huang immediately replied.</p>
<p>As they were talking, I recalled that in June, when the Yangzhou relief organizations were still in the investigation phase for the displaced refugees in Yangzhou, the entire 25th Division had reduced their food intake for several days, and later distributed rice at the county public sports field to provide emergency relief to the refugees. Later, when Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs came to Yangzhou to provide relief, many refugees in the refugee camps rushed forward and called General Huang their "benefactor." I also recalled the newspapers and many enthusiastic people in Shanghai who were worried about raising money for refugee relief every day. If news reporters should publicize the good and expose the bad, or have the right to scold bad people, then I believe that praising good people should also be an obligation. Moreover, if praising good people is the same as scolding bad people, then this piece of writing is not only intended to praise good people, but also to scold bad people.</p>
<p>The Ratio of Three Million People</p>
<p>Next, we talked about the phenomenon that the government is often criticized and attacked by some newspapers, while the Communist Party is understood by some.</p>
<p>I said, "This is because some people who have just returned from the rear do not understand the actual behavior of the Communist Party and its army."</p>
<p>General Huang said, "No, even in Shanghai and Nanjing, looking at those displaced refugees, they should know what the Communist Party is doing!"</p>
<p>From this, we talked about the problem of the three million displaced refugees in northern Jiangsu being a minority of the total population of ten million in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>General Huang said, "As far as I know, the Communist Party's recent method of dividing three and a half mu of land to each farmer in northern Jiangsu has not been welcomed. Therefore, in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu, there is a lot of land that no one is willing to cultivate. Because, according to their regulations, the cultivator only gets one or two tenths of the harvest of one season of grain."</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, I don't know how, the topic was turned by General Huang from the suffering of the people to the suffering of the soldiers. He said:</p>
<p>"Hey, you news reporters should go to the lower levels and see our soldiers. Have you been in contact with them? Their lives are really too hard... You should advocate for them!"</p>
<p>I said, "Regarding the suffering of soldiers, this newspaper had a section called 'Voices of Soldiers' in March of this year, which described the suffering of soldiers in great detail. I used to cut out this article and I remember it."</p>
<p>Moving Forward, Obeying Orders</p>
<p>In this way, it seemed to be after everyone had lit their cigarettes for the third time that the conversation finally touched on our "original intention." However, we were somewhat disappointed for the refugees because General Huang said:</p>
<p>"The Nanjing ×× Daily criticized us for giving up Ganquan Mountain after entering it last time, and retreating. According to them, we should move forward. We know this too; the sooner we recover many places, the sooner the refugees can return home. But, first, fighting a war is not like moving into a new house, is it? Second, moving forward is possible, but we must get orders from above."</p>
<p>So, recovering Shaobo Town and Gaoyou County, which everyone is paying attention to, and according to the geographical situation, although the responsibility lies with the 25th Division, if the government does not give it an order, then naturally it cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>It was almost 5 o'clock when the reporter and Mr. Hang Zhou said goodbye to General Ji. On the way back, I initially felt disappointed for the refugees, but then I thought of the issue of secrecy in military affairs. At the same time, because I was walking on the road, I also thought of a saying: "Fighting a war is not as easy as walking."</p>

<h3>Simply Adorned West Lake in Summer</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th, Reporter Huang Hangtian</p>
<p>"The lake is beautiful in all seasons, especially when the flowers are in full bloom."</p>
<p>Hangzhou, of course, does not have the coolness of Qingdao, nor the tranquility of Mount Lu, but compared to the annoying Shanghai, Hangzhou is, after all, paradise. Those who bear the burden of life, of course, do not have the fortune to go to Mogan Mountain to escape the summer heat, but as long as you take the time to go to Lingyin Temple once, and stroll or drink tea under the towering ancient trees, you have reason to compare yourself to someone who has climbed Mount Lu and is walking in the shade of the trees. (The lack of fog is a drawback.)</p>
<p>Yuquan Pool and West Lake Serve as Makeshift Seaside Bathing Beaches</p>
<p>If you are a favored child of summer, a swimming enthusiast, then the Yuquan swimming pool is a good place for you to go, you can compete with the colorful fish in the Yuquan pool of Qinglian Temple. Those friends who do not want to go far, will take the West Lake along Yingbai Road to serve as a seaside bathing beach. Along this area, the bottom of the lake near the shore is made of pebbles, and not the "soft mud made of incense ash" as one might have heard, which will drag your feet (or even your body) into the lake. Therefore, besides not being able to enjoy the olfactory sensation of the sea air, you also have reason to treat it as a seaside bathing beach. Every day after noon, regardless of the fire-like heat of the sun, there are hundreds of men jumping naked into the water, letting the soft lake water caress the soles of their feet, their chests, their cheeks, injecting the tenderness and coolness of the West Lake into every pore of their bodies, washing away the fatigue in their bodies.</p>
<p>A Small Boating Trip on the Lake in June Eliminates All the Summer Heat</p>
<p>If you are a quiet person, then boating on the lake is the best "key." "A small boat on West Lake in June, the person in the boat is an immortal in the water." "Paradise" and "immortals" are originally inseparable. Yang Wanli's words are not excessive. Su Shi had long said: "If you compare West Lake to Xi Shi, it is suitable with or without heavy makeup." The "simply adorned" West Lake in summer is still charming. When the setting sun sets and the afterglow shines on half the sky, the shadows of the mountains flicker, and the water ripples. Nature, with an invisible giant hand, secretly puts on the gauze of twilight, making the quiet lake and mountains suddenly gain a mysterious color. Hire a boatman, abandon the annoyance of the lakeside, go to the heart of the lake, let the late breeze gently caress your hair, fluttering your clothes, take a refreshing breath, and you will realize: "The heat of the human world is like cooking, but once you get on the lake boat, you will not know it." So you let the boat drift with the wind, passing through the White Causeway, boating among the lotus leaves of Inner West Lake, listening to the lotus leaves rustling against the bottom of the boat, as if there was an invisible rain falling. At this time, the bright moon should rise, and you are floating between the moon in the clouds and the moon in the water, picking a lotus fruit at random, gently peeling it open, and tasting its clear, fresh, and tender taste. The feeling of being an "immortal" arises spontaneously.</p>
<p>There are two different ways for the people of Hangzhou to go to the lake: the above is only "touring the lake," and there is also "playing on the lake." Of course, there are more people who "play" than people who "tour." From early evening when the lights come on until one or two o'clock in the morning, this is when most people play. Within these few hours, all six hundred boats on the lake can be dispatched, carrying twos and threes of men and women at a price of 1,500 yuan per hour, swaying with the waves near the Lakeside Park. At this time, you can see the lake view with dotted lights by the moonlight, and you can also see the prosperous modern material civilization along the Lakeside Road. The jazz music coming out of the loudspeakers in the night gardens and cafes, with the breeze, sends sentences of teasing, decadent sounds to the eardrums of the tourists, which seems to show more power of music than the dance halls of Shanghai. There are also boatmen selling songs on the lake. You only need to spend 500 yuan to hear them sing a song or opera that you like to hear. If you are thirsty, the boat has fruit and other things. They can do more than 100,000 yuan in business a night, which is much more fortunate than the vendors on the roadside.</p>
<p>Spending 3,000 Yuan to Be a Water Immortal at Midnight</p>
<p>Some people who are particularly afraid of heat like to spend the night on the lake. After two o'clock in the morning, you can invite three or five friends, spend 3,000 yuan, and you can be a "water immortal" at midnight. At this time, the boatman puts away the oars and paddles, and sits on the stern, letting the small boat drift lightly on the lake with the current. Although the security in the surrounding countryside is very problematic, you can sleep soundly on the lake. The poetic and picturesque scenery is enough to intoxicate you, needless to say.</p>
<p>In addition to touring the lake, drinking tea is also a way to escape the summer heat. There are two types of places to drink tea: one is the ordinary teahouse, which does not require attention to detail. The other is on the mountain, in the villas and night gardens along the lake, which is more "noble." Hangzhou, like Suzhou, is a paradise of water towns, and there are many teahouses on the streets. The people of Hangzhou are not as busy as the people of Shanghai. They take a nap at noon, get up, touch their faces, and drag their shoes to the teahouse. As long as there is a pot in hand, they can talk about everything from the sky to the earth, from flies to the universe. Criticisms of the government are also gathered here. I think this is a good place for the government to collect public opinion and for news reporters to interview local news. They can provide you with a lot of materials for you to dig up.</p>
<p>On the tree-lined road in front of Yunlin Temple, tea seats are set up along the mountain stream with its thin stream. Everything here is quiet, you can hear the babbling of the mountain stream, the cicadas on the trees singing leisurely, facing the cool mountain breeze, and drink a sip of fragrant Longjing tea. You can forget the humid heat and be completely immersed in the embrace of nature. The Jingu, Zhongmei, and China cafes are also full every day. In these places, there are songs and dances, and the eyes and mouth can eat "ice cream" at the same time.</p>
<p>A Wonderful Move by the City Provisional Assembly: Applying to Restore Dance Halls</p>
<p>Hangzhou does not have any dance halls now, and those who have a desire to "dance" have to use listening to songs to pass the time. The City Provisional Assembly has already applied to restore dance halls for those "lovesick men and women." Their restrictions are very simple: no dance hostesses. The Hangzhou newspapers have criticized this "flip-flopping" attitude of the Provisional Assembly, but the middle and upper classes of Hangzhou strongly agree with this proposal.</p>
<p>Although the heat wave is pressing Hangzhou tightly, those who have money to spend do not lack resorts to escape the summer heat. As for those who live with mosquitoes, bed bugs, and smelly sewers, bearing the heavy burden of life, even if "paradise" is close at hand, it is difficult for them to be "celestial beings."</p>
<h3>It's Not Easy to Live in Great Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Air Dispatch, 12th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Since its restoration, Guangzhou has made considerable progress in some areas, but for the average citizen, life is indeed getting harder day by day. There are many factors contributing to this situation, but the most important ones are the weak production, economic decline, and soaring prices since the victory. The salary income of general laborers and people at all levels cannot keep up with the pace of rising prices, like a rickshaw racing against a car. As a result, the lives of citizens are becoming increasingly difficult, and social order is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Appealing for the Distribution of Siamese Rice, The Problem Has Yet to Be Solved</p>
<p>At the beginning of the restoration, everything was difficult. Everyone seemed to have put the problem of "clothing" in a secondary position. Everyone was satisfied with just having clothes to cover their bodies, so although an ordinary suit costs 800,000 or 900,000 yuan, ordinary citizens can ignore it and it does not threaten them. However, the problem of "food" is too serious! Here, some people may doubtfully ask: Hasn't the grain shortage in Guangdong Province passed? Isn't the grain price in Guangzhou very stable? Aren't batches of relief rice being shipped in one after another? Yes, these are all facts, but the problem does not lie here, but in the fact that most people simply cannot find food to eat. In the past, an official in charge of grain policy here said the most wonderfully: "It is not that the grain price is too high, but that ordinary citizens are too poor!" This statement may seem a bit ridiculous on the surface, but thinking about it, it also makes sense; because no matter how low the rice price is, if ordinary citizens cannot solve their employment problems, what good is a low rice price? Therefore, the severity of this problem is due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and all industries and businesses are facing a precarious situation due to the impact of imported goods. The unemployed account for two-thirds of the city. In this situation, the difficulty of finding food can be imagined! Recently, there is another measure taken by the authorities that has caused the greatest blow to ordinary poor citizens, that is, the municipal authorities, in order to tidy up the city's appearance, have uniformly prohibited vendors from setting up stalls on the streets. In the authorities' minds, of course, this measure is taken for various problems such as traffic order, but they only have negative sanctions and no positive relief measures. They do not have a public market or anything like that, and they resolutely prohibit them from setting up stalls, which has driven this vast group of vendors to the brink of a life panic; as a result, the number of unemployed poor citizens waiting for relief is increasing day by day!</p>
<p>As for relief rice? According to the report of Li Huahui, the deputy head of the Siamese rice supervision group, at the Guangdong Post-War Relief Review Committee meeting on August 7, the first batch of more than 40,000 bags of Siamese rice to the fifth batch of more than 40,000 bags have all arrived in the provincial capital one after another. This is indeed good news; at the same time, according to the report of Ma Kaiyan, the director of the Storage and Transportation Department: From July 28 to August 3, there were 3,468 bags of rice in the warehouse, equivalent to more than 140 tons, 22,700 tons were received, 20,500 tons were issued, and the warehouse loss was more than 130 tons... According to the latter report, the warehouse loss has reached more than 100 tons, which is enough to shock people, and in the current state of famine, the more than 3,000 bags of Siamese rice stored in the warehouse are not being distributed in time, which is really perplexing! Therefore, the unanimous appeal at present is to immediately distribute Siamese rice so that the poor can benefit sooner, but the appeal is still an appeal, and whether or not it will be distributed remains to be seen next time. Anyway, although dozens of starving people die on the streets every day, as time goes on, everyone seems to be accustomed to it and will no longer be shocked!</p>
<p>Rent Is Surprisingly Expensive, And "Initiation Fees" are Also Demanded</p>
<p>Speaking of the problem of "housing," it is also quite serious. The reason is that after Guangzhou was occupied, the houses damaged by the enemy and puppets amounted to three or four tenths, while the city's population is increasing day by day, and has now reached more than 1.2 million; according to estimates, there are about 100,000 private houses and shops, of which shops account for about half, and on average, each house can accommodate seven or eight people, which can only accommodate 700,000 or 800,000 people; therefore, in this situation of housing panic, the landlords regard the houses as scarce goods! Indeed, in Guangzhou, there are countless people who are homeless and sleeping on the streets. Even if you can afford the rent, it is really not easy to find a house to live in; even if you find one after much hardship, the rent is surprisingly expensive, not to mention that according to the bad example of renting a house in Guangzhou now, in the first month, in addition to the advance rent, there are also a series of so-called "initiation fees," "shoe money," "introduction fees," and "security deposits." In short, in the first month, you have to pay an amount equal to four or five times the rent before you can move in; assuming the rent is 50,000 yuan per month, then you have to pay 200,000 to 250,000 yuan to live in the first month, and that does not include house donation fees, police fees, neighborhood expenses, etc.! This is not all, and some more unconscionable landlords will ask you to move out in less than three months for unreasonable reasons, such as saying that his family members are coming from the countryside, or saying that his house is going to be sold, pulling three and dragging four, and insisting that you move away; because the house is so valuable, as soon as you leave, maybe within an hour, a new tenant will come to fill it, and the landlords can collect a large sum of "initiation fees," "shoe money," etc.!</p>
<p>The Roads Are In Terrible Condition, It's Better Not to Go Out at Night</p>
<p>Speaking of "traveling," after the restoration, transportation outside the city is not a big problem because several important railways and highways have been restored, the air routes and schedules are gradually increasing, and although the sea transport has not been fully restored, it can barely cope. But in the city, one feels that it is not easy to travel! First, the price of rickshaws and public transportation has risen, causing ordinary people to sigh. Second, the roads in Guangzhou are probably the worst in the world; whether it is the busiest area or the most remote area, no road is missing a piece here or broken there: whether you are riding in a rickshaw or a public bus, your butt will be sore non-stop! Third, due to the poor security, robberies often occur in broad daylight, so when walking on the street, even if you have a fountain pen or a watch, you have to be worried: in the evening, then it's even "better not to go out"!</p>
<p>In short, if you want to know the life of ordinary citizens in Guangzhou today, the simple answer is only one word: "difficult." With life so difficult, social order is bound to be chaotic: therefore, the citizens of Guangzhou, especially the poor masses, are all earnestly hoping that the authorities can find a way to solve all their current difficulties as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Published Every Monday Worker's Summer School</h3>
<p>— By Mei Xin</p>
<p>Workers in Various Industries Utilize Vacation Time for Further Education, Curriculum Emphasizes Knowledge of Labor Issues</p>
<p>Many American laborers are spending their summer vacation this year as students in numerous schools and workshops, receiving education and enjoying recreation.</p>
<p>A steelworker from Pennsylvania can spend his two-week summer vacation at a summer camp run by Pennsylvania State University, while autoworkers in the Midwest can pursue further education at a summer school organized by the local branch of the Michigan Industrial Union Council. This school covers 200 acres, is near Lake Huron, and begins on August 4th, located approximately sixty miles from Detroit. Textile workers in the South can spend their summer vacation at North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>Workers in various American industries can use this general vacation time to participate in labor summer camps or courses set up by senior union officials, government labor bureau officials, and university professors. These courses will include labor-management reconciliation procedures and contract negotiation laws, labor convention regulations, world affairs, labor history, and more. Regarding industrial management, participating students can learn about production processes, pricing issues, and the problems capitalists may encounter.</p>
<p>Two Systems</p>
<p>These two-week short courses are set up in two systems: one is the summer camp organized by labor unions, and the other is the labor school. The first type, the summer camp, is organized separately by local unions, and the issues studied are mainly limited to the problems of local union members. The labor school has a broader scope, including cultural subjects in addition to labor issues, and the student body includes not only organized labor but also workers who have not joined unions and even college students who are interested in labor issues.</p>
<p>Since a large number of people regularly desire to gain admission and training opportunities, priority is given to union leaders. Furthermore, there are many teachers willing to serve in these educational groups, and many are waiting for the opportunity to be hired, believing that labor groups are excellent subjects for educational experimentation because these workers have extremely rich practical experience but little theoretical cultivation.</p>
<p>Four Schools</p>
<p>There are four labor schools in the United States: the Hudson Shore Labor School across from Hyde Park in New York, the Workers' School at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, and the Affiliated School for Workers Summer School at Forest Lake, Illinois.</p>
<p>Among these four schools, the Hudson Shore Labor School is the oldest, with a history of 25 years this year. It was originally a summer school for female workers, but later became co-educational. The school's purpose is to make male and female workers understand their own problems, so educators have set up a curriculum that includes economics, English speaking skills, and drama. In addition, there is a factory so that workers can study the most personal problems. The school's plan is supervised by a board of directors consisting of teachers, past students, and representatives elected by labor groups.</p>
<p>Wisconsin's labor school starts in early June and ends in mid-August. It is the only state-supported labor school. In 1925, there were only 34 students, but in 1945, the number had increased to 545, with students from various states and Canada, with an average age of 39. The main purpose of this school is to enable workers to collectively negotiate everything with employers. The school's work is mainly divided into three parts: the most important part is, of course, the summer students, followed by the winter school and service work.</p>
<p>Fundraising</p>
<p>The Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, now often attracts laborers from Southern states to study. Since 1945, the school has launched a campaign to raise a $70,000 fund in order to accommodate more students and increase the number of teachers and equipment.</p>
<p>Students at the Affiliated School for Workers Summer School include union officials and non-union staff. The school is in session from July 13 to 27. This school was originally initiated by Oberlin College in Ohio in 1933. Since then, it has been held annually on the campus of a university, but the selected location is mostly in the Midwest.</p>
<p>However, these summer schools are not just work and no play. Most summer schools and training courses have well-arranged entertainment programs. For example, the Pennsylvania steelworkers' summer camp stipulates: "Afternoon time can be spent playing golf, tennis, handball, softball, and picnics. There is a small river stocked with salmon next to the camp, so you can also enjoy fishing."</p>
<p>Each person participating in the summer camp spends approximately $25 per week, which includes food and lodging. Some summer workshops charge tuition fees of $10 to $15 per person, which is often paid by the union to which they belong.</p>
<p>These summer schools are just one part of the situation of labor education in the United States. American labor education is now being carried out nationwide, and its purpose is to adapt to the times, so that the labor sector, which is becoming increasingly important, its leaders and members can receive good technical training and be sufficient to solve labor problems.</p>
<p>Labor Relations</p>
<p>Labor relations have now been included in the curriculum of 75 American universities. Renowned universities such as Harvard, Cornell, the University of Chicago, and the state universities of Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Michigan, and North Carolina all teach this subject. Many professors often go to labor venues to participate in labor gatherings while lecturing on issues related to workers' lives. Professors are exposed to a large number of workers through this relationship.</p>
<p>There is a California Labor School in San Francisco that specializes in training students to serve as labor leaders (another similar school is in Los Angeles). This school not only occupies a high position in the labor movement but is also highly respected in academia, and many famous universities such as the University of California and Stanford University have unanimously praised it.</p>
<p>These many different labor education institutions prove that it is generally recognized that labor must have access to inexpensive educational opportunities, and that both unionized and unorganized labor should enjoy educational facilities in the same way as agriculture and commerce.</p>
<h3>North American Aviation Company's Private Airplane, Seats Two, Payload Roughly Equal to Ordinary Sedan</h3>
<p>— Special dispatch from the New York Times via this newspaper</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>There are many skilled engineers who can use simple machines to manufacture goods that still meet the highest standards. This is the skill of these engineers and a manifestation of their ability to utilize their knowledge.</p>
<p>B. The relationship to mechanical equipment: Each type of goods requires a different machine. This must be taken into account when designing goods. In the initial launch, there should be several different types of goods (a small number), because after the variety of goods increases, whether the company has sufficient financial resources to cope with the installation of machines is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>Sometimes, making a product can utilize the same machine, or slightly increase a little equipment. With minimal cost, you can have a by-product, a different product. Therefore, goods are very closely related to mechanical equipment and should be taken into account when designing goods.</p>
<p>C. The durability of machines: After a factory is established, machines cannot be purchased frequently. Therefore, when purchasing machines, you must also consider how many years a machine can be used. Or, to manufacture a product, there are several different methods. If method A is used, the required machine can be used for ten years. If method B is used, the required machine can only be used for five years. Then, it is naturally better to adopt method A. This point should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>D. Extending the sales period: Many goods can only be sold for a few years. After a few years, there must be new styles, otherwise, they will be outdated. Therefore, you should choose goods that can be sold for a long time, so that the cost of equipment and advertising will not be wasted. Moreover, from the perspective of starting a business, it is also required to be long-lasting. If you only obtain benefits temporarily and do a little speculative business, then it is naturally another matter.</p>
<p>E. The relationship between packaging and transportation: When designing goods, you must consider the issue of packaging and transportation. For example, if a product is most convenient and economical to be packaged in bottles of one ounce each and twelve dozen per box, then do not change the amount per bottle to one-half, which makes packaging and transportation inconvenient. Also, cigarettes are mostly packaged in ten, twenty, or fifty sticks. No manufacturer would package cigarettes in thirty or forty sticks. First, it breaks the long-standing habit and is not easy to sell. Second, packaging and transportation are also inconvenient.</p>
<p>B. Installation of Machines</p>
<p>After the product design is completed, you must purchase machines. After the machines are purchased, they must be installed. When installing, you need to consider the following points:</p>
<p>A. Must be firm: Many heavy machines require a base to be made and buried in concrete to make it very firm and immovable. If the machine is not firmly installed, then accidents will occur. If not, it will be frequently damaged, so it must be absolutely cautious.</p>
<p>B. Must be safe: Running a factory "safety first" This sentence is very worthy of adoption, because when an accident occurs in the factory, it will cause damage to the machine, or casualties to the people, or disasters to the house, or loss of raw materials or finished products. Equipment such as motors, electric wires, and steam boilers must be considered for safety issues when installed.</p>
<p>C. Must be smooth: The machine installation must allow the work to proceed smoothly. It must not suddenly go east, suddenly go west, suddenly go up, and suddenly go down, so that the work cannot proceed in order, because the result of not being able to proceed smoothly in the manufacturing process is to waste labor, lose time, and the raw materials or semi-finished products in manufacturing.</p>
<p>D. Must be spacious: There must be spacious space around the machine so that workers can walk around, and after taking the raw materials, they will not touch the machine. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Aesthetic Education and Human Peace</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Mencius advocated that human nature is good, while Xunzi, in contrast, advocated that human nature is evil. The debate over whether human nature is good or evil has been going on for thousands of years. What exactly is it all about? The world has already suffered the lessons of two major bloodsheds and should be able to realize something. Educators bear the great mission of transforming human psychology and creating true world peace. However, in ambitious countries, education has become a tool for manufacturing war. How was Japanese elementary school education conducted in the past fifty years? They consistently promoted aggressive ideologies. A teacher would hold an apple and say to the students, "How beautiful and sweet this apple is! Where does it come from? I'll tell you, it comes from Yantai in Shandong Peninsula, China. Do you love to eat it? Grow up and go to China quickly." Frankly speaking, Japan's cultivation of natural science education over the past half-century can be said to be successful. However, its understanding of the historical background and philosophical thought of the East was vague and distorted, leading it astray, and one wrong step can cause a thousand years of regret. Confucius said, "If you want to establish yourself, help others establish themselves; if you want to achieve success, help others achieve success," and "Do not seek to live by harming others; be willing to sacrifice your life to achieve benevolence." This was originally the lofty ideal of Chinese philosophers, but the Japanese never dreamed of it. Educators are like workers managing dyeing vats or artisans making plaster models. They can dye things blue or yellow, create a human form or a beastly shape. A stone, in the hands of Michelangelo or Rodin, can become an extremely valuable work of art for millions to admire. A blank piece of paper, under the brush of Li Sixun or Wang Wei, can depict vast clouds and smoke, the endless miles of the Yangtze River, unprecedented masterpieces. A few plum blossoms, a bundle of withered chrysanthemums, what are they? In the eyes of Lin Bu and Tao Qian, they saw the great life of nature and symbolized the serenity and noble character of the soul.</p>
<p>Humans are not just two arms and a waste-making machine; they possess a spiritual life that other animals do not have. Americans historically looked down on black people, but President Lincoln, who liberated the slaves and sparked the American Civil War, was ultimately a great man. Although black people, in general, have been slow to advance in cultural development or lag behind other ethnic groups, their achievements in music have already demonstrated great genius. Recently, the most popular songs and dances in the United States have been imitating the style of black people everywhere. The author once saw a black female star, Josephine Baker, perform in a theater in Paris, and the box office was breaking all records. When we sailed the Indian Ocean and landed on the island of Ceylon, we immediately saw a group of Indians sitting on the ground and eating with their fingers, which seemed a bit unpleasant. However, when we toured the famous cities of India, visited the major temples, and saw the exquisite carvings and magnificent murals, it proved that Indians have indeed made great achievements in art. And during the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties in China, we were indeed greatly influenced by India in culture. In Buddhist thought, we can see that Indians are a great nation with a transcendent view of life and wisdom!</p>
<p>Bergson said, "Other organisms are mainly controlled by instinct, while humans rely on intelligence to control life." A person's life is nothing more than the activity of will and emotion. The promotion of will and the driving of emotion originate from the cultivation of personality. Therefore, humans can break free from the control of instinct and have the spirit of upward creation. The virtues that humans admire are truth, goodness, and beauty, which is what Mencius advocated as the goodness of human nature. The opposite of truth is hypocrisy, the opposite of goodness is inferiority, and the opposite of beauty is ugliness, which is what is called the evil of human nature. To eliminate evil and promote goodness, we rely on the cultivation of aesthetic education, because aesthetic education has two characteristics: one is universality, and the other is transcendence. The famous mountains and rivers created by nature can be visited by everyone. The setting sun and bright moon can be appreciated by everyone. Everyone laughs heartily when watching a comedy. A sad song brings tears to people's eyes, because aesthetic sense can tear apart people's narrow prejudices and give humanity sympathy, transcending the concept of self-interest. This is clear proof of the universality of beauty.</p>
<p>Wen Tianxiang, imprisoned and humiliated, produced the "Song of Righteousness" in his cell, expressing his great aspirations for the universe and life. Yan Hui, living in a humble alley, was so poor that he could not even make ends meet, but "others cannot bear the sorrow, yet Hui does not diminish his joy." He was able to transmit Confucius's great principles. Wu Xun, who begged for a living, was able to create a great path for popular education. Tolstoy, who sympathized with the suffering of farmers, renounced the honor of the nobility, loved nature, and tilled the fields himself.</p>
<p>The above historical facts prove that this kind of aesthetic sense that transcends self-interest, great and noble behavior, has the spirit of "wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot move, and power and force cannot subdue." This is a beautiful life, and it is also the great value of life.</p>
<p>In ancient Chinese education, as early as two thousand years ago, they began to advocate aesthetic education and physical education, using ritual, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics as the six arts. Except for mathematics, all contain artistic components. The original meaning of ritual is to abide by rules, to yield and advance, "to revolve within the circle, to turn within the square." Music is pure art. Archery and charioteering seek artistic training and belong to the scope of physical education. Writing is used to record events and is another department of art. Later, such as the literary garden of the Han and Wei dynasties, the sculptures of the Northern and Southern dynasties, the poetry of the Tang dynasty, the lyrics after the Five Dynasties, the paintings of the Song dynasty, and the novels and dramas after the Yuan dynasty, each flourished and grew with the culture of each generation. In terms of education, it must rely on the cultivation of art, instilling spiritual vitality, and then there will be a life rich in content and harmony. Unfortunately, since the Han dynasty, the education system has been replaced by the six classics instead of the six arts. Although the six classics are the legacy of sages and philosophers, reading only the six classics is book knowledge and is divorced from life education. The result is that it flows into the study of sentences and phrases. Furthermore, the imperial examination system is used to select officials, and the eight-legged essay becomes a profession. In general, people only know how to whine and mutter, focusing on trivialities, creating a style of national decline and decline in China for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The purpose of aesthetic education is to cultivate a beautiful outlook on life, hoping to create living people with universality, truth, goodness, and beauty, eliminate all the treacherous, greedy, cruel, and inferior behaviors of struggle in the world, and promote the noble aesthetic sense of human beings. Now all mankind is studying how to consolidate true world peace, then cultivating a beautiful life with aesthetic education should be a great way to world peace!</p>

<h3>Art and National Life</h3>
<p>— Translated by Huang Hanqiu. Written by Takamura</p>
<p>Translator's Note: This article was published before our nation's victory. The points it makes are extremely pertinent and can serve as a model for others. Any nation can learn from it, especially our nation after its victory, which is still in an era of imperfection. How can we neglect the core of the entire nation's development?</p>
<p>It goes without saying that these are unprecedented times. To fulfill our nation's mission, our nation is entrusting itself to fate. However, we must resolutely complete this mission, which is more important than anything else. Therefore, if anything happens, the entire nation must cooperate and work together. First, deeply ingrain this point in our hearts, and then consider everything from this perspective. This is the way to guide the people. If the entire nation cannot cooperate and work together, what is the most terrifying thing? It is the desolation of people's hearts caused by the difficulties of extraordinary times in national life—that is, the desolation of the human spirit. This war has lasted for many years, and the scarcity of living materials is a matter of course. In our country, this is the first time we have experienced this. This poverty and hardship in life has had a considerable impact on people's hearts, which is a fact. Even if the war is won, there are many examples in the First World War of falling due to the desolation of people's hearts in the rear. Therefore, nothing is as terrifying as the desolation of people's hearts, because there is no visible boundary between before and after. When it is exhausted to the extreme, there is only one path to destruction. People's hearts cannot be moved by mere reason. Without the nourishment and light that comes from within, people's hearts will not work automatically. I believe that the reason why we must pay attention to art in such extraordinary times is based on this point. Speaking of art, many people say that they are only worried about what to eat every day, so why bother with art. Although that may be true, it is a complete misunderstanding of art. Many people think of art as a luxury, such as the appreciation of calligraphy and painting, antiques, the design of house styles and decorations, and the beautification of clothing. They only think of these things. However, that is wrong. Although those things are undoubtedly a part of art, what I want to emphasize today is the original fundamental question, which is the question of the heart. The heart of art, the artistic heart, or the artistic spirit, is originally a kind of ability that exists in everyone's heart. It gives people a kind of unspeakable nourishment and light from within, and makes people live green and vital.</p>
<p>The Heart of Science</p>
<p>Recently, some people have advocated that the most important thing lacking in the general life of our people is not various kinds of scientific knowledge, but the heart of science. Moreover, the so-called heart of science can be said to begin with an overview of things and a careful observation of objects. In any case, this is the fundamental way of thinking. Similarly, in terms of art, it is not just buying paintings or wearing beautiful clothes, but possessing the heart of art, the artistic heart, and the artistic spirit. So what is the artistic spirit? First, it is the heart that savors things. That is, the heart that loves things, the heart that does not treat things rudely, the heart that discovers the advantages of things, etc. The ambrosia (delicious taste) that one gets from savoring things ecstatically is the beginning of art. In any aspect of life, one must discover its advantages, create its beauty, and explore its meaning, thereby obtaining calmness, nourishment, and light in terms of life. Speaking of the artistic spirit, it is the same as religion, it is to save people. However, it is different from the methods of religion. Religion is to remove the pain of life, to make the painful become painless, to make the hot become not hot. To put it bluntly, fire can also be regarded as cool, which has such an amazing power. The artistic spirit does not necessarily remove the pain of life. But because it savors that pain, it insists on pain as pain on the one hand, and feels pain in one place. For that pain, it has an unyielding power, which is what the artistic spirit gives. The artistic spirit is the expression of not allowing those who live comfortably to fall into idleness, and not allowing those who live in poverty to frequently fall into despair. Those who live in small shacks in slums, or those who live in small attic rooms, can see the world in a pot, which is a person with an artistic spirit. If that kind of person goes to live in a tall garden house, there is also a world in a pot there. If that kind of person becomes a big entrepreneur, there is also a world in a pot there. Once the world's politics are in his hands, there is also a world in a pot there. That is, at any time, he will not be controlled by circumstances, will not be confused by things, will not expect to benefit himself. He can maintain calmness, nourishment, and light in his heart at any time. The so-called artistic spirit is such a spirit.</p>
<p>Artistic Spirit</p>
<p>Originally, people always have some kind of artistic spirit that savors things. From a comprehensive view of our country's ancient literature and art, and considering the general life of the people, it can be understood that our ancestors, regarding the savoring of things, the love of things, were unwilling to handle them roughly, maintained the nourishment of life, did not lose the light that arose from the world in a pot, and constantly followed the path of generation and development. This spirit gives the nation style and taste, as well as elegant interests. Therefore, we always want to make the national character higher than other countries, so as to promote the electrical character to all mankind. Since the Restoration, the material civilization of Europe and the United States has been imported too rapidly, and this character has presented a state of confusion. The standard of beauty has also lost its normality. Therefore, the original rich artistic spirit of the country has been buried in the hearts of the general public, and even what they have has become indifferent, resulting in the current situation. Everywhere, for the sake of utilitarianism, everything is done hastily, everything is done without intimacy, everything becomes a state without love. The hearts of the people simply lack leisure. Talking about the heart that savors things, etc., seems to be outdated and inappropriate. However, that cannot continue. That cannot develop the nation. In today's extraordinary state, if we do not strive to urgently seek the awakening of the artistic spirit, the general desolation of the national life may be unavoidable. This is a very important matter. Fortunately, recently the authorities have realized the importance of culture, and have established the Ministry of Culture and used the most suitable people, so we can finally ease our worries. To awaken the general artistic spirit of the people, we must take all effective means. I will not talk about other cultural aspects for the time being. Regarding the question of art, in short, we must first break the preconceived notion that art has nothing to do with national life.</p>
<p>Things Around Us</p>
<p>In short, art is something close to the people, and we must make them feel that it is in the national life itself. In any case, artistic works are the concrete embodiment of the artistic spirit, and it is easy to make people feel this interest. To give the people the opportunity to have frequent contact with good art, that is, to pay attention to all public buildings, so that the general public naturally utters a sound of admiration, is a method. In this regard, the so-called national common residence problem, etc., is advocated, because the direct impact is great, which is very worthy of review. All things that have been exposed to the eye and are harmful to the national aesthetic sense; for example, advertisements, signs, street lines, etc. with vulgar elements, should be improved, which is also a method. When old-fashioned houses still exist, the progress of artistic decoration in the living room must be encouraged. In the future, based on the meaning of sharing the view with the public and sharing the appreciation with the public, we will greatly promote the commemorative art to create the art of the national beautiful intention. In the aspects that have been constructed in the past, where there are books on elegance, we must now consider and discuss a method on the original site, because the problem of the entire nation is more important than the problem of the individual. Like the exhibition: in the past, it was only engaged in like an arena for artists, a road to fame, etc., which must also be considered and corrected. Moreover, as long as the focus is placed on the nature of the national festival of beauty and opened, it will naturally be reasonable.</p>
<p>Also, Tokyo has the Imperial Museum, the Okura Shukokan, and recently the Nezu Museum has been established. To increase the interest of citizens by using this kind of thing, we still need to take some method and implement it. Just like London is completely a commercial city, but the utilization of art museums is very developed. The artistic spirit is to join hands with religion and science to support the people to obtain the power to develop the nation. Especially now, it is a time when the people urgently need art, so I solemnly put it forward and do not hesitate to talk repeatedly to complete my words.</p>
<h3>Famous Paintings and Famous Artists</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Da Vinci, the Versatile Genius and His Masterpieces</p>
<p>Da Vinci was an illegitimate child born in Vinci village near Empoli, Florence, Italy. From a young age, his parents were unknown and his surname was not clear. The villagers called him "Da Vinci" (Leonardo de Vinci). It is said that he learned to paint from the sculptor Verrocchio (1435-1488), a friend of his father's acquaintance. Da Vinci's father, what his name was, Fan never told anyone, only said that he was a famous great lawyer. Da Vinci's natural talent, after a few years, finally achieved great success, surpassing his teacher, and finally became an outstanding figure among the world's great men.</p>
<p>He is one of the few technologists. Bridges, city construction, all engineering projects have been created by him with extraordinary results.</p>
<p>He is also a sculptor, and he also produced a lot of exquisite sculptures. He is also a scientist, and he has invented many sciences, airplanes, automobiles, and many weapons have been designed by him accurately, and he has made many contributions to the world's academics. He is also a writer, and he is also a poet and an astronomer. However, in addition to the amazing achievements in the above departments, what is now famous in the world is painting. His paintings occupy a brilliant position in the history of art.</p>
<p>His masterpieces in his life include "Mona Lisa" (Eternal Smile), "The Last Supper", etc. There are many interesting anecdotes about the production of "The Last Supper".</p>
<p>It is said that "The Last Supper" is a mural commissioned by the Santa Maria Monastery to paint. When the production began, it was very smooth. He worked day and night, sometimes forgetting to eat and drink, and he was immersed in his conception. After that, because the appearance of "Jesus" and "Judas" in the painting took a lot of brainpower, and he was not satisfied with the painting, so it was delayed for two years. After the monks repeatedly urged him, Da Vinci could not stand such a blow, and finally said to a monk who came to persecute him in great anger: "In the future, please don't come to persecute me again, I will definitely hand in the paper tomorrow." The next day, it was completed. When the host of the monastery discovered that the appearance of "Judas" in the painting was similar to a monk in the temple, he asked Da Vinci: "What does this mean? Is this person going to be a Judas in the future?" Da Vinci nodded and said, "The reason why I delayed this painting for two years is because I have never seen a person with Judas's character since I was a child. Today, a certain monk in your temple persecutes me every day, with the momentum of nailing me to the cross, so I pretend to be his appearance in the painting to replace Judas." Not a few years later, the host of the monastery was indeed killed by the monk. Before he died, he still told people about this matter, and praised Da Vinci for having the foresight.</p>
<p>He died in 1519, at the age of about fifty-seven or eight years old. He is known as one of the three Italian heroes.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"If that's all you're worried about, I can offer you two suggestions: First, love is not a terrible thing, unless the man or woman really doesn't understand love and takes lust for love. I read a line of Shakespeare's poetry: "Hope is the lover's staff; gripping it, it helps one walk; waving it, it resists the will to despair." Gu Jun, don't we have a common goal? If we take ten thousand steps back, even if we seriously fall in love with each other, isn't this love a 'staff' that we share?</p>
<p>"Furthermore, I have carefully observed the international situation and see that the ruthless chaos is coming! With our background and mood, can we still steal time to talk about love? Even if there is mutual admiration, or one-sided admiration, at best, it is just a spiritual connection, only 'heart to heart'."</p>
<p>"Gu Jun, your experience and knowledge are countless times greater than mine. Do you think my two assumptions can stand? If so, you don't have to be afraid to meet me."</p>
<p>I had just read to this point when I suddenly heard a rustling sound from the cabinet. He'er and I ran to the edge of the stove at the same time. I opened the cabinet door, put on the headphones, and picked up the microphone. I heard the number called by the Shenyang main station. I matched the secret code with the other party, and heard the other party report "154...14..." This is our special number, indicating that the following is a string of our private password. After listening to this special password, I gave He'er a gesture, and he immediately prepared his pen and paper, and our communication work immediately started.</p>
<p>After the other party finished reporting the special password, I took He'er's record and repeated it as usual to avoid recording errors. After the re-reporting was completed, He'er had already placed a small booklet on the table and carefully translated it.</p>
<p>This small booklet has a total of only 1,450 commonly used Chinese characters: ten characters per line, ten lines per page, so there are only seven or eight leaves in total. Judging from the format, it looks like a small copybook. The arrangement of the words and sentences is like a long song, but some places are not very smooth. There are three tricks in it, and without training, it is impossible to use it no matter what.</p>
<p>These three tricks are all non-organic mixed with organic. For example, the page number and the order number of the words are non-organic; but according to the four six-hour periods of day and night, they are divided into four kinds of changes, and the rotation of 52 weeks a year creates another kind of change. So every week there is a different translation method. When necessary, the person sending the telegram can reverse the seasons at any time, and then the order of the weeks will also be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>The most powerful change in the organic type is that the receiving end can temporarily request to change the reporting order of the password: for example, this password report has a total of 155 characters, and the receiving person first asks for the total number of characters, and then reverses and confuses the order of the entire text. The sending party will tell the word. This move is to prevent someone in the team from stealing the password and selling the message within a short period of time. Because this German wireless telephone is built extremely cleverly, as long as the distance changes, the frequency will also change. That is to say, if the sending and receiving parties have the correct frequency, they can talk to each other. Assuming that a third party also receives this frequency from the sending party, they can only hear the sound of the sending party, and can never hear the sound of the receiving party at the same time; because the location of the third party cannot be exactly in the center point where the distances of both parties are equal; in this way, even if the third party receives this telegram, it will only be a chaotic mess, and it is simply impossible to explore.</p>
<p>What if the communication station loses this booklet? It can be said that it doesn't matter at all; ordinary people think it is a copybook, and if the spy steals it, because there are too many organic changes, it is also impossible to apply it. If a colleague loses it, they must report it immediately. However, in the past ten years, the comrades who were in charge of the radio station cherished this thing as much as their own lives. The loss has never happened, and it has only been destroyed a few times.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>According to reports, a bizarre fraud occurred in Hankou. An old woman named Zhang Feng, through the method of bidding associations, invited business women to organize bidding association groups, with a total of more than 1,700, absorbing more than 1.3 billion legal currency. She used this to exploit heavy interest, looking like a big rich man.</p>
<p>The election of Shanghai Miss initiated to relieve the refugees in northern Jiangsu mobilized so many people, and the newspapers promoted it every day. There will also be a large-scale garden party, and the goal is only 2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>In contrast, it is more and more believed that it is easy to do evil and difficult to do good.</p>
<p>A friend, originally a civil servant, sent his family back to his recovered hometown after the victory. Another friend started an export merchant house and asked him to help in Shanghai, saying: "You have stuck to your post for eight years, and you can ask yourself without shame. Now it is helping me, and let yourself stretch your waist." The friend agreed. Unexpectedly, for more than half a year, I only saw batches of foreign goods being imported, and exports were simply stagnant. The friend was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Now the tariff on export goods has been removed. I wish my friend can really stretch his waist.</p>
<p>Yang Wendao's ten years of injustice now have a chance to be overturned.</p>
<p>A new discovery is that the original accuser, Zeng Yuan, was again reported as a traitor.</p>
<p>Originally, viciousness, treachery, meanness, greed, etc. are the "virtues" of some social dregs, but they are also the "virtues" of some henchmen traitors. Is it not appropriate for the dregs of society to be traitors?</p>
<h3>Where is the City Center?</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Recently, when Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau entertained reporters, he reported that the authorities had decided to implement traffic control measures in the city center area from September 1, and added a note that the so-called city center area refers to the area west of the Bund, east of Tibet Road, north of Zhongzheng East Road, and south of Suzhou Creek. Because of this note, I can't help but have a question, where is the city center area after all.</p>
<p>We all know that Shanghai has a city center area. That was before the war, when the Chinese government, because the concessions had not been recovered, spent a lot of manpower and material resources to build it on its own. Everyone praised the magnificent houses and the neat and flat roads. Unfortunately, although the project has been completed, when the development was not yet sound, the war broke out, and the city center area was of course inevitably doomed.</p>
<p>However, the city center area is of course still the city center area.</p>
<p>After the victory, the concessions have been cancelled. The office address of the municipal government is probably located at the original site of the former British and French Municipal Council, because it is convenient to control the urban area. At first, it seemed that the words "Temporary Office" were painted on it, but later it was erased, with the appearance of dying in this hometown. How it is, of course, non-outsiders can know.</p>
<p>Recent news, but I heard that the Works and Education Bureaus are going to move back to the city center area, then it seems that this ordinary municipal center of gravity still has a day to rely on. After the confusion, this city center area will probably be grateful and tearful.</p>
<p>However, this time the city center area for traffic control is obviously "counterfeit". Since the city center area does not allow opening branches, of course, it does not allow "two suns in the sky".</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of lively areas, this section may be called the center. In terms of the entire Shanghai city map, the seat of the "city center" is still given to the old brother. Since there is already a city center, this time the area for traffic control should not be confused, I think, at most, it can only be named "urban area"!</p>
<h3>A Sweet Kiss</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Zhongji from the August Reader's Digest</p>
<p>Time: During World War II.</p>
<p>Place: The moment the Romanian tunnel train passes through the tunnel.</p>
<p>People: A young girl, a Romanian, an old lady, and a German officer.</p>
<p>Plot: The four passengers were sitting very properly when the train did not enter the tunnel; after a while, the train was pitch black, and it turned out that the train had entered the tunnel. At that time, a sweet kiss suddenly came in the dark, followed by the sound of a slap in the face. When the train returned to light, only the German officer's eyelid had a bruise.</p>
<p>The girl thought: Huh, how can there be such a good appetite man, who doesn't love to kiss me, but goes to kiss that old woman!</p>
<p>The old lady thought: This girl is so fierce, she was kissed by a man, and she was so angry that she slapped her in the face.</p>
<p>The German officer thought: Haha, I haven't been slapped by a woman for a long time. It's quite interesting to be slapped by a woman. I have to thank this Romanian who forcibly kissed the girl.</p>
<p>At this time, what was even happier than the German officer was the Romanian, because he kissed the back of his hand, and then slapped the hateful German soldier hard, but there was no trace of it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai has a surplus of glass, a shortage of books, and even more school shortages. Among these, it is difficult to say in one word, and even if you talk about "One Thousand and One Nights", you can't clear it up.</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai has a surplus of "democratic slogans", a panic of order. Walking on the road, cars and pedestrians only see themselves but not others. People walking see cars rushing around and gnash their teeth. When they sit in the car one day, they blame why there are only annoying pedestrians on the road? People waiting for the tram see the car not stopping at the station and gnash their teeth, but when they get on the tram, they hope to drive straight to their destination. Alas, the flood of freedom has become selfishness!</p>
<h3>Various Difficulties of the Tram Company: An Explanation from Two Ticket Inspectors</h3>
<p>(Editor's Note: This article is submitted by Liang Shile and Liang Hebo, ticket inspectors of the tram company. Although they speak from the company's perspective, their points regarding the need for passenger cooperation are worth considering by the public. Therefore, we are publishing it below:)</p>
<p>We now wish to make a small plea for the British-owned tram company, which is currently being criticized by all sectors. Although from our point of view, this is superfluous. We are merely ticket inspectors.</p>
<p>Arriving Late</p>
<p>Waiting for a tram under the scorching sun is an annoying matter, especially when one often waits for more than half an hour and still no tram arrives. Perhaps all passengers already know the reason for this. During the enemy-puppet period, all the company's resources were almost completely taken away, especially the severe shortage of tires. Therefore, trolleybuses such as routes 18 and 20 cannot operate. Furthermore, due to the few trams and many people on routes such as route 16, it is more likely to cause tire damage. But this point can be easily resolved as long as there are tires available.</p>
<p>Why Not Stop</p>
<p>Passengers who have been waiting for a long time suddenly see a tram arriving. Just when they are happy, the tram suddenly drives away without stopping. It is impossible to blame the general passengers for getting angry. Let me explain: the company has strict regulations on the intervals between tram departures. When leaving the depot every morning, the times are arranged in order of departure. In addition, there are outdoor ticket inspectors and ticket writers at both ends of each route who are responsible for supervising the vehicles. Under such strict management, "missing a stop" rarely happened before the war. However, the current situation is different. There are more people and fewer trams. Furthermore, there are many vehicles on the road, blocking the main roads, and accidents occur frequently. Trams are like dragons, running one after another. After it is finally resolved, every stop is bound to be crowded with people. Imagine passengers who have been waiting for a long time at the station seeing a tram arrive. How could they not try desperately to get on? But the tram is already packed. However, passengers only care about squeezing inside. Passengers above cannot get off, and those below are stuck at the tram doors and unable to get on. Deadlocks occur from time to time, which often causes trams to miss their stops even more. When a tram misses a stop, the company colleagues, based on many years of experience and to ensure the safety of passengers, have no choice but to drive away, because the tram behind will be coming. Regarding this point, the problem of traffic order in Shanghai must first be resolved.</p>
<p>Empty Trams Also Do Not Stop</p>
<p>Every day at eight or nine o'clock in the morning when people are going to work, every stop is always crowded with people. Suddenly, a route 2 tram, after dropping off passengers on Yuyuan Road, accelerated and drove straight ahead, without stopping at Jing'an Temple or Hart Road, and possibly not even at Seymour Road. Those abandoned passengers were all furious. I know their hearts are full of hatred. But you are wrong to blame us, because if the tram stops at Jing'an Temple station, it is likely to be crammed full of people. By the time it reaches Hart Road and Seymour Road, it can only pick up a very small number of passengers. Furthermore, sometimes, because the tram is already packed at Jing'an Temple, the driver has the right not to stop at nearby stops. Therefore, based on the ratio of the number of passengers each station can accommodate, we send an empty tram to Hart Road or Seymour Road every few trams. I remember once I saw that Seymour Road was really crowded, so I specifically ordered an empty tram to be sent from Jing'an Temple. At that time, I also went on the tram. Unexpectedly, when the tram arrived at Hart Road, a passenger, seeing that the empty tram did not stop, clung to the iron door and refused to let go. I was afraid of trouble, so I told the driver to stop the tram. Then other passengers swarmed onto the tram. The passengers who got on the tram, without asking questions, spat on my face. I wanted to reason with him, but the other passengers were all aggressive, and no one would sympathize with me. I could only suffer in silence. When the tram arrived at Seymour Road, a group of passengers squeezed onto the tram and happily shouted: "Lucky—Lucky—We even got seats!" However, the price they paid for sitting in these seats was that I had to be spat on.</p>
<p>Queuing to Board</p>
<p>The above three situations often lead to misunderstandings by passengers. We cannot deny that in some situations, we cannot achieve the goal of serving all passengers. We absolutely welcome criticism from all sectors, but we do not welcome hostile abuse. We hope for fair guidance and good ways to improve, but the most important thing is to ask all passengers and our company colleagues to cooperate closely. The simplest and easiest way is to queue to board the tram! Our company colleagues have suffered countless grievances for this point. The company authorities have specifically set up ticket inspectors at each station with many passengers to assist passengers in queuing. Sometimes, it is easy to form a queue, but as soon as the tram arrives, the queue is disrupted again, which is equivalent to queuing up in vain. The young and strong may swarm up, but you should not be happy. You also have elderly parents and petite younger sisters at home. If you maintain this good order, you are also helping your own family.</p>
<p>The above points are our personal opinions and explanations. Our only hope is to ask everyone to cooperate with our company colleagues and to ask newspapers to publish more articles on public morality!</p>
<h3>Serial Cartoon: The Adventures of Sanmao as a Soldier (79)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>A Few Suggestions for Hospitals and Doctors</h3>
<p>— (35·8·16· Lü Tian)</p>
<p>According to reports, the other day, Chen Xiaomei, a fourteen-year-old female worker at the Hongda Cotton Thread Factory on Fanhuangdu Road, was cleaning cotton yarn when her arm was dragged into the machine by the thread on the roller, severing her arm at the shoulder. The bone and flesh were only connected by a thread of skin, and blood flowed all over the ground. She was sent by ambulance to Tongren Second Hospital on Yidingpan Road for emergency treatment. In order to demand a consultation fee of four thousand yuan and a deposit of five hundred thousand yuan, the factory owner, Shi Meicai, paid ten thousand five thousand yuan first, which was all he had with him. The remaining amount was even guaranteed by a police officer. Zhang Lei, the head of general affairs at the hospital, did not agree to provide emergency treatment first. Even the nurse, Zhu Jingxian, coldly said: "The public has no money to subsidize here. Process the procedures first, then save the person." This caused a delay, causing Chen Xiaomei to lose too much blood. The hospital refused to admit her and had to transfer her to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment, and her life is in danger. Now the hospital director Huang Mingxin and the head of general affairs Zhang Lei have been summoned by the Changning Road Police Station. (August 15, Tiebao) Regarding the legal responsibilities of this case, as well as the fact that a fourteen-year-old child dares to accompany the machine due to the pressure of life and bear the unbearable heavy work, which involves the entire social problem, will be discussed in another article. First, I would like to put forward a few thoughts on the duties of the hospital:</p>
<p>Saving Lives and Helping the World</p>
<p>For twenty years, the government and people of our country have been advocating a public medical system. However, due to the lack of overall planning and determination by the authorities in charge of health administration, private doctors cannot fully take saving lives and helping the world as their duty, resulting in the current situation where doctors use the amount of money as the criterion for the depth of their treatment. As a result, selling fake medicines, exaggerating illnesses, and playing tricks to mislead patients happen frequently. The "rice bowl mentality" of public doctors, perfunctorily dealing with patients as "troublesome customers," is only to cope with the situation for the sake of their jobs, which gives the society a bad impression of distrusting public doctors. It must be known that doctors should take saving lives and helping the world as their duty. Doctors are by no means a free profession, but a cause for human beings to consolidate their groups, benefit the people, and contribute their talents to serve the people. Only when doctors have the determination to recognize medicine as their duty can they study carefully and reduce the suffering of patients. The public medical system is a system to achieve this goal, to make universal use of human resources. That is, all doctors should be hired by the state, assigned to various places throughout the country, and the state should be responsible for their living expenses. Their salaries must be higher than those of general public educators now, enough for their lives, and doctors must contribute their talents to serve the people. Civil servants are the servants of the people, and doctors should be the servants of the people's health.</p>
<p>Serving the Public</p>
<p>Since the medical profession is a career of serving the public, doctors should further demonstrate their service to the public. After some hospital doctors have completed their diagnosis and issued a prescription, they will introduce you to a pharmacy and advise you: This medicine is only available there, or the medicine in that pharmacy is of high quality and accurate in content, or you can get preferential treatment if you buy it with this note. But in the end, the same medicine, following orders to the designated pharmacy, the price is not only not preferential, but will be higher by some amount. It is said that this is the "kickback" from the doctor's introduction. The hospital has a deposit item, so it is not easy for many poor people to seek medical treatment. For acute and poor illnesses, there is simply no hope of treatment. It is said that some hospitals' third-class wards still require acquaintances to run errands and some tips to find a way in. Money, money, money, Shanghai is a world of money, but it is suffering those poor compatriots. Are the poor citizens even deprived of the freedom to get sick and seek medical treatment?</p>
<p>Two Major Demands</p>
<p>Before the establishment of a public medical system, in order to save the current deformed and unreasonable phenomenon, I put forward two requests:</p>
<p>First, in order to maintain business, hospitals must collect consultation fees, but the income and expenditure must be reasonable. The higher fees for first- and second-class wards can be used to subsidize the poor and sick. In the event of an emergency, treatment must be given first, and then the consultation fee can be discussed. In our country's traditional concept, gratitude is deeply rooted. You saved his life; he will never forget you. Your generosity and willingness to save people will deeply touch people, and may even make the patient's family sincerely reward you more.</p>
<p>Unified Drug Names</p>
<p>Second, unify drug names and mark drug prices. Our country has always lacked unity in drug names. For example, the insecticide "Santonin" is translated as "Suo Tuo Ren," and "Penicillin" is translated as "Pan Ni Xi Lin." The same drug has different names, so it can be falsely claimed that this is not that, and tricks can be played. Even changing tablets into powder to deceive patients, just so that those who only seek profit can achieve their tricks. At the same time, doctors issue prescriptions all in Western languages, which makes patients feel as if they are in a fog. When they take it to the pharmacy, they are at a loss and let the pharmacy calculate the profit they want. The author once took the prescription for the same calcium tablet to several pharmacies. The same brand of goods had prices that differed by more than a thousand yuan. Therefore, the responsible health authorities should urgently unify the translation of drug names and standardize prices. At the same time, whether doctors can use Chinese as much as possible in future prescriptions to avoid patients being deceived is also worth studying. Moreover, after using Chinese, the source of the disease, the symptoms, the method of taking the medicine, and the recuperation can all be clear at a glance, without the need for repeated instructions, which saves time and benefits patients. What is not to like? The customs office has now clearly ordered that Chinese should be the main language, so why are doctors so particular about writing in Western languages? Moreover, "German names" and "English names" show people factional views. It is better for Chinese people to use Chinese characters, which are appropriate and do not lose the national spirit. What is the "gimmick" in writing a few lines of "foreign characters"?</p>
