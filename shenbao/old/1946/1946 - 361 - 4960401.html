<h3>滬蘇僑與美憲兵衝突　蘇向美提出抗議　據謂美兵醉後駕車肇事</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿五日電〕關於美國憲兵於九月間在上海與蘇聯公民馬丁諾夫及邱查二人發生衝突一事，頃據莫斯科無綫電台廣播塔斯社消息稱：蘇聯駐美大使館爲此事，業已向美國務院提出抗議，促其注意。緣有美國軍人一名，於九月間在滬酒醉後駕車撞壞蘇聯公民馬丁諾夫所駕之汽車，馬丁諾夫當即要求該美國軍人一同前往警察局，詎意該美國車人匪特拒不前往，抑且揮拳痛擊馬丁諾夫，其時美國憲兵的廿名左右，聞訊趕到，竟亦將馬丁諾夫曁其友人邱查毆打，馬丁諾夫頭部受傷，臂腿亦均被毆而受傷，事後蘇聯駐滬總領事，曾致函美國駐滬總領事台維斯，但迄未見答覆。美國駐軍總司令吉倫中將曾發表報吿，將衝突責任，諉諸蘇聯公民馬丁諾夫及邱查二人，蘇聯政府觀於此種情形，乃訓令其駐美大使館，向美國國務院提出抗議云。</p>
<h3>美報續指責蘇聯　認大連事件乃兩國關係之「測驗」</h3>

<p>〔中央社紐約廿五日專電〕美斯克利浦斯霍華德系之世界電訊報，今日復於社論中論大連事件，指責蘇聯無信謂：倘蘇聯無良好之信用，則訂立新條約之會談，亦屬徒勞，該報謂：中蘇友好條約，原定大連爲自由港，惟紅軍對大連城市及港口之控制，至少已使該條約之一切實際目的，均爲單方面之行爲所破壞。蘇聯廢棄或更改該的之行爲，似僅爲蘇聯之外交，而未與另一立約國及與該約有關之其他方面磋商。該報謂：蘇聯縱簽署刻在談判中之條約中之若干部份，其價値仍屬可疑，倘蘇聯無良好之信用，則此種談判，亦屬徒勞。該報於載社論之同一版上，尙披露漫畫一幅·標題爲「自由港」。</p>

<h3>從世界看遠東</h3>
<p>四國外長會議與聯合國大會的相繼圓滿閉幕，在國際上不僅使擾攘不安的一九四六年獲得一個平靜的歸趨；而且也使一九四七年的國際政治展開一慕美妙的遠景。從此人類更可以相信，目前離開其日夜所渴望的和平，雖然還十分遙遠，但是這個人類共同的願望，終有實現的一天。所以世界各國的政治外交家於聖誕節向各該國人民所發表的演說，對於明日之世界，莫不表示樂觀與愉快。聖誕老人帶來了和平的福音，實令人感奮，就是在戰災各國的人民，也感覺到無限的溫暖。</p>
<p>但是從世界局勢看到遠東的情形，一重妻凉的陰影，突然投射在每一個人的心頭；遠東可以說是世界政治中最脆弱的一環了；在世界沒有發生戰亂之　，早就在烽火蔓延之中；到了世界各國均能和平相處之後，遠東的烽火還沒有熄滅的希望。中國國內的戰亂不必說，印度尼西亞首先揭起民族解放的大　，與荷蘭駐軍從事殊死的鬥爭，流血己逾年餘，迄今僅成立了一種印荷協定的草的，尙未獲得雙方的批准。其次是越南，在維明共和政府總統胡志明的領導之下，本欲以和平諒解的方法，達成越南的獨立自主，他爲了要達到此項目的，曾親自前往巴黎，與法國當局締結法越條約，以促進法越的關係，而謀雙方的幸福；無如法國駐越南高級專員達香里歐海軍中將，始終未脫過去法國對待越南人民的態度，以致激起越南人民的憤怒，乃造成目前擾摟不安的局面。現在法國正値社會黨領袖勃魯姆秉政，對於越南所當採取的政策與態度，自有改變的可能，否則越南局勢必將每况愈下，不知要造成何種可悲的局面！再决爲印度緬甸，英國工黨內閣雖於本年初宣佈印度的獨立，最近艾德禮首相又宣佈緬甸的獨立，但是在印度的內部發生了印回之爭，回敎聯盟始終堅持着印回分治之主張，拒不參加印度臨時政府，對於印度制憲會議，也採取旁觀的態度，英國雖欲從中拉攏，但是倫敦英印回三方面的圓桌會議，仍未能獲得任何成就。回教從在印度各處，採取破壞行動，使印度陷於恐怖狀態，雖經印度聖雄甘地以絕食死諫，也沒有獲得成效。至於緬甸，離開眞正的獨立，還有一段漫長的距離。</p>
<p>亞洲的實際情况旣如上述，列强在亞洲的關係，猶未完全明朗。尤其是美蘇兩國對於遠東問題所當採取的立場，尚在明暗不定的狀態之下。美蘇兩國對於若干世界問題，旣能互相諒解，照理對於遠東問題，也是不難成立妥協約。但是實際的情形如何？殆難斷言。例如日本賠償問題，美蘇的意見不當會南轅北轍，如何折衷成立妥協，實在是一個非常困灘的問題。何况蘇聯朝野，對於美國管制日本的政策，始終表示不滿。其次是朝野的統一問題，美蘇兩佔領區實行合併，實在也是刻不容緩的事情，否則朝鮮被人爲的因素，肢解爲兩部份，不僅血液不能通暢，而且深度割裂的痛苦，當然談不到復興的間題。再决是我國的東北問題。蘇聯搬運了這末許多的工業設備，在蘇聯言，稱此爲戰利品，由其搬走的理由，十分充足；但在美國而論，則認爲此非戰利品，而應將此作爲日本賠償之用。雙方各執一詞，至今尚未獲得結論。最近忽雙發生了大連的事件，美國輿論界對此，雖然十分重視；但美國當局爲避免美蘇關係惡化起見，乃表示淡然處之，並希望由中蘇兩國直接進行談判解决，美國國務院能顧全大局，不從小處着眼，實在是一種賢明的辦法。但是在蘇聯當局對於美國，却仍斤斤較量，例如蘇聯僑民與美國憲兵數月前在上海發生的衝突事件，本來是一件非常瑣碎的事情，但是蘇聯外交當局，却小題大做，竟由蘇聯駐美大使向美國國務院提出抗議，使我們終覺蘇聯當局對於美蘇關係好轉的時機，並不十分珍惜，不能不引爲遺憾。</p>
<p>要之，從世界看到遠東，目下遠東雖然還在黎明之前，但是人類是進步的。尤其在第二次大戰之後，其進步必更加迅速，越南與束印的烽火，即足以證明帝國主義的時代業己終了。同時從各種因素看來，尤其是杜魯門總統最近發表的對華宜言，重言聲明，去年十二月十五日所發表的對華宣言，繼續有效，實令人相信，遠東局勢也有隨着世界大局好轉而開期的希望。</p>

<h3>江南入冬亢旱　農作物多受損害　川省府撥欵改良農產</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江訊〕入冬以來，天氣亢旱不雨，各地農作物均受影響，除部份冬作未能播種，蔬作並受虫害，記者頃向蘇省農林改進委員會調查各縣農作物災情如後：鎮江天旱不雨，冬季作物十分之八均受影響。句容，天旱不雨，冬作布三分之一未能播種。溧陽，蔬菜稍有虫害，尚不嚴重。武進，蔬菜發現芽虫為害。常熟，上中旬久旱，麥作遲播者發芽不齊。吳江，一部份蔬菜發生虫害。南匯，天氣亢旱，蔬菜害虫為害甚烈。南通，上中旬蔬菜發生芽虫，為害在百分之三十以上，江浦，天氣亁爆，冬作少數未能播種。金山，蔬菜發現芽虫，黑殼虫為害。</p>

<h3>廣東五年建設　擬定詳細計劃　分三部門廿四類八十二項</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州訊〕傳聞已久之廣東五年建設計劃，經記者多方探詢，已略悉其大概。查該計劃係由羅主席卓英於年初決定，派省委黃文山為五年計劃起草委員會主委，李揚敬·謝文龍·杜梅和·兵　·姚賓猷·羅香林的為常委，聘請專家學者及各主管負責者九十餘人任起草委員，省內知名之士咸應聘參加集體創作，草定各門類建設計劃，並以省設計考核會副主委賴希如為主編，梁謙武為副主編，費時幾六月，四易其稿，並曾提省行政會議及省參議會研討，全部計劃不日可公佈，內容分經濟文化政治三大部門，二十四類，八十二項。</p>
<p>經濟</p>
<p>經濟建設門，以奠定工業化基礎及解決民主食衣之足給為中心，綜計建設公營工廠五十餘所，農塲九十餘所，漁塲四十餘所，礦塲二十餘所，發電動力三十餘站，水利工程四十餘處，最後一年效益可達足供全省人民減少全省糧食缺額百分之四十，衣料百分之三十。</p>
<p>文化</p>
<p>文化門以掃除全省文盲，培養職業專門人才為中心，綜計建設國民學校四三九六八所，職業學校三二所，師範學校一〇三所，中學校一〇三所，專科學校五所，培養留學生一〇〇名，最後一年效益可掃除全省文盲百分之八十，儲備建設人才百分之六十</p>
<p>政治</p>
<p>政治門以實施地方自治鞏固憲政基礎為中心，計分基層建設，警政建設，財政建設，地政建設，衛生建設，社會建設，合作事業，市政建設等專章，以期樹立現代政治之規模。據該會負責人談，該計劃係根據中央國策，及中央設計局物資及文化建設計劃原則，並參考蘇聯五年計劃與美國TVA制度，及本省實際情形而草定，每項事業設計，對於過去概況，中心業務分年進度，預期效益，所需資金及人才等均詳為規劃。</p>
<p>資金</p>
<p>其資金額定為戰前幣值六億元，籌集方法，另有方案，聞正呈中央核示中。就記者觀察，廣東為政治安定之區，且經濟資金向極活躍，苟能運用僑資，吸收游資，循此堅定而行，則他日建設之成就，不僅可使革命策源地之廣東進入建設之新階段，抑且將大有裨於建國前途也。</p>

<h3>國大閉幕聲中　憲法產生，代表們輕鬆多了</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張明</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國民大會堂在今天確像辦喜事，又溫暖，又光亮，人潮來往，大家見了面就是笑，誰都覺得心上少了一件事，肩上卻多了一付擔，這付擔子是從今天起，每個中華民國的國民所應當付與的。</p>
<p>吳稚老擔任主席，拿着這珍貴的孤本，憲法，獻給蔣主席時，宛似聖誕老人帶來了最珍貴的禮品。</p>
<p>洪闌友頭髪新理，一身燕尾大禮服，忙上忙下確像辦喜事人家的主角兒。洪宣讀資文時，聲調穩練極了，聽來悅耳，與這四十日來的若干次疲勞轟炸，實有天壤之別。</p>
<p>大會堂裏代表見面盡是歸去聲，不外是什麽工具，什麽時日，還有的是離別之宴的繁多，真的此一別又得一年，明年今日再圖聚首一堂，無限別情不勝依依。這是大會歡樂之中的一點離愁。</p>
<p>開會前有人在招呼：「凡是民國廿年參加過國民會議，現在參加國民大會的同仁，請注意從前我們是制定約法，今天我們是完成了憲法，希望同仁們於會散後集合起來攝影留念」。</p>
<p>中華民國憲草從今天開始，換了一個字，正式的合了「法」一部憲法用錦面裝訂，並在封面貼紅緞一條，上燙「中華民國憲法」六個金字，字體是按照國父遺墨三度放大而成，這是珍貴而又珍貴的。</p>
<p>憲法是今天上午方三　通過，但是下午就由大會交出來了，交出時全部條文都已繕就，據說這是一為無名英雄葉毅一手所成，葉毅是國大的秘書，為了這部憲法，曾經幾個通夜未眠，但是他的墨跡終於成了歷史上不朽的文件。</p>
<p>這部憲法放在特製的木架上，木架上漆有國旗一面，下署國民大會四字，放在主席台上，並圍以彩綢，登台一覩者絡繹不絕，攝影記者成隊而來，用各種方式各種角度來攝取他們的藝術寫真。</p>
<p>開會前吳稚老與主席蒞臨，是吳在前，主席在後，散會時主席仍讓吳氏在前，但吳氏一再謙讓，結果主席笑容滿面先一步而出。</p>
<p>洪秘書長與吳文官長上台舉行接交典禮時，洪在前，吳在後，下來時彼此謙讓，吳居先，洪隨後，這些都是有意義的鏡頭。</p>
<p>蔣主席致詞時，全體代表始終總是情緒提得非常高，所以轟雷似的掌聲隨時都爆發在會堂裏，最後中華民國萬歲的聲浪不絕於耳。</p>
<p>會塲中最忙碌的，是簽名，新聞記者，大會職員，以及代表，都忙着找人簽名，尤其于髯公，真是筆不停揮。</p>
<p>國大之后本屆任期完畢，皇冠將要取下重作布衣矣。</p>
<p>大會堂門前拍照生意好，每次開會前後，總是成羣成隊的在那兒拍團體照。今日雖下雨，仍然不得休息。據談大會預備給代表們拍全體照，只是地點難見，最後決定是陵園，但是天不作美，下雨天拍不成，明天起又將紛作歸計，大半是拍不成了。</p>
<p>代表們最後的點心，是梅蘭芳的戲，今晚已在勵志社上演，明天起在大華，代表們眼福不淺。</p>
<h3>吳興絲綢業危機重重　布疋百貨店相繼倒閉</h3>
<p>〔本報吳興訊〕本縣出產絲綢，聞名全國，自勝利後，因受黃金飛漲之刺激，復受高利貸之壓迫，各種捐稅之繁重，及工資之增加，以致營業一落千丈，前途岌岌可危，雖經當局商請四聯分處，舉辦絲綢貸款，以渡　歷年關，但因四聯貨款辦法太苛，尚在洽商中。其他布疋百貨等商店，因人民購買力薄弱，市面不景氣影響，虧本甚鉅，無力維持，於一個月內，相繼倒閉者，已有十餘家，近有開設最久，範圍最大之同裕綢布號，亦於本月二十四日突然倒閉，並請姜仲明律師宣告淸理，可大布店亦售存貨，預備關門。最近三日內，民生必需品及日常物價，突飛猛漲，蔓無止境，燒餅油條驟漲一倍，一般平民及薪水階級者，大受威脅</p>

<h3>慕臺抵越南作實地調查　河內法軍扇形推進　達香禮歐闡明法國政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿六日電〕法國殖民部長慕臺今日在越南實地調查聲中，越南渤已在北部安南與東京兩省作扇形推展，越盟軍隊仍堅強抵抗。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿五日電〕據河內法國參謀總部最近發表之公報稱：法軍完全控制之地點，僅維明政府首都所在地，越盟軍仍在周圍各區頑抗。該公報稱：「該城中心情形安謐掃蕩戰業已開始」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿五日電〕法軍參謀部頃發表公報，宣布法軍在越南續有進展。略稱，法軍業已將河內之安南人聚居地區加以包圍，刻正進行掃蕩工作，越軍抵抗仍極活動，但法軍仍不斷向公墓方面挺進。另有法軍一隊自河內出發，已於今晨進抵巴克寗，現正繼續向福麥松前進。此在南定方面，越軍仍日夜攻擊火車站，在越軍屍體一具，及日士兵屍體數具，越軍損失雖重，但仍以極大人數發動軍事行動，海塘鐵僑已為越軍所毀。法國援軍一批已自海防開抵海塘，海防郊外刻正遭越軍迫擊砲猛烈轟襲，諒山與大延兩地法軍現已取得連絡，越軍三千五百人於本月十九日進襲順化，常被法軍擊潰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿五日電〕法國今日發動加強其在越南方面之政治及軍事前綫。法國降落傘部隊第一旅已自北非乘巡洋艦「杜格斯納」號開往越南。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿六日電〕法國海外殖民部長慕臺昨夜自加爾各答飛抵此間，法駐越高級軍政長官皆在機場歡迎。慕臺答覆記者之詢問，僅謂，余此行乃欲實地視察，不欲多言，且在越南勾留之期甚暫，約於一月十六日即擬回返法國。余此行徵得國會之完全同意，吾人保衛法國人民與友邦人士之政策并不變更云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿五日電〕法國海外殖民部長慕臺抵此之後，此間頓時大為震動，與明政府逃逸時之情形初無二致。政治觀察家咸認為慕臺部長與法駐越高級專員達香禮歐同在西貢，足證法政府願與維明政府獲致協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿五日〕法國遠東軍司令勒克萊將軍前往越南視察，昨夜道出此間，略事休息後，即前往加爾各答。又據路透社訊：勒格萊行前曾獲如下之訓令：（一）研究軍事局勢；（二）研究衝突原因，及恢復和平之方法；（三）估計需要之增援總隊；（四）將研究所得向海外殖民部長慕臺報告該報復稱，法當局擬再調二萬人增防越南，擬由法郵「法蘭西島一號及前航空母艦「貝恩」號運輸。</p>
<p>〔聯合社西貢二十五日電〕法國駐越南高級專員達琴禮歐今日向此間法國居民發表廣播演說，其內容略謂法國不致允應越南人民完全獨立之要求。獨立無異一種神話，對於法國及越南之利益，俱有嚴重損害，惟法國允履行地方自治協定。若於越南人民進化之現階段，即準予無條件完全獨立，實非雙方之福。</p>
<h3>越南劃中立區　保障僑胞安全　我總領事交涉已告失敗</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕週來越南局勢因法軍武力行動，引起越盟政府之抗戰後，日驟惡化。我在越僑胞生命財產大受損害，彼等已向外部提出請求，請與法越雙方交涉，於海防河內等華僑集中城市劃定「中立區」，聞我外交當局對此議，正予考慮中。</p>
<p>又甫於二十日恢復之中法關於越南問題協定實施之談判，日來又告停頓，蓋現下混亂之越南局勢，亟須前往越南實地考察後方可決定之數問題，如海防自由區之劃定·滇越聯運辦法之設計·與賠償物資設備之估值等，均無法進行。惟刻仍留京之法代表團與我方各負責談判人員，均一致盼望法越問之癥結，能迅速覓得解決途徑，使越南局勢可恢復安謐，俾此項談判得早日獲得結果。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內廿五日電〕法越兩國軍隊日來發生衝突，華僑罹難者截至目前為止，僅有一人之身份業已查明，華僑財產損失為數頗少。但在歐僑區內，華僑之生命財產均未受損失，法國軍隊現正在華僑地區與越人地區之交界處，中國駐越南總領事昨日曾進入該地區與越人及華僑接觸，俾能劃定一中立區，但於今晨宣稱，此行任務已遭失敗，渠將賡續努力，務使此項計劃得以實現。此外又據法官方人士談稱，北圻法軍決司令莫里愛將軍業已同意設立中立區。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕法國境內越南共和國軍民為越南事件而舉行示威遊行，情緒激昂。土倫斯，波爾多，穆林，瑪桑康特，蒙特呂貢及里昂等地，皆有示威遊行隊伍。　數自一千五百人至二百人不等。口呼「法軍不再駐在越南」「尊重法越協定」「法越友誼萬歲」等口號，并要求立即停止越南共和國境內之戰事，否則將實行絕食云。</p>
<h3>法國內閣會議　總理報告越局</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕法國內閣於今日開會，聽取內閣總理勃魯姆報告國際局勢，以及越南最近之發展。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕頃據官方公報宣佈：法國海外殖民部長慕臺出國期間由國務部長勞倫暫代。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿六日電〕「紐約通報」頃評述法蘭西第四共和國在艱苦情形下得以成立一事，認為值得加以重視。并申述其理由如次：內政方面，首宜加以注意者，乃未能組成真正代表各方面之政府，而由社會業單獨組閣。該黨在國民會議之人數，僅佔六分之一而已。其次為財政上之困難，目前頗使法國感覺窘迫。其三為戰後元氣尚未完全恢復。以言國際情形，法國外交政策在東方與西方之間，亦使其舉棋不定。政府之長期不穩；對於此種困難，不能緩和。以越南事件而論，法國於應付不暇之時，尚需從事殖民地戰爭，實使困難益增。但以法國人道精神深堪一點而論，前途尚許樂觀。</p>
<h3>德俘參戰　臨陣脫逃</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼剌廿五日電〕據自盤谷乘飛機來此之旅客談稱：參加越南法軍作戰之德國俘虜，於法軍在越南北部與越盟軍作戰時，臨陣脫逃，惟此項消息尚未證實。法軍在越南邊境一帶施行嚴厲檢查，故對內中情形，外界難得其詳。惟據稱，德俘參加法軍作戰及其脫逃等事，盤谷人士類皆如之。</p>
<h3>蘇聯不甘後人　捕鯨船開南極　日捕鯨隊工作活躍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿五日電〕蘇聯報紙今日載稱：蘇聯捕鯨船一隊，計共九艘，及大型供應船一艘，已自蘇聯開向南極。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿六日電〕據麥帥總部天然資源局本日發表稱：日本開往南極之捕鯨隊，於十七日已開往南極之捕鯨隊，於十七日已開始捕獲巨鯨兩頭，一為白長鬚鯨，一為長鬚鯨，均為橫須賀船隊所捕獲，其後該船隊五日間又捕獲三十一頭。又據今晨來電：已於廿四日到達漁場。長崎船隊亦已開始捕魚，第一日捕獲二十六頭。又有英國視察團於本月六日在龍包克海峽乘日本捕鯨船隨往參觀。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕英外交部發言人稱：華盛頓電傳美國務院已請英國駐在南極馬格麗灣之探險隊退出所佔基地，以供美巴爾特中將所率探險隊使用之說，并無根據。福克蘭羣島英探險隊所居者，為其自建之房屋，并設有天文臺一座。其他探險隊如前往，雖將給予協助，惟其所儲糧食，已不敷更多人之用。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十五日電〕關於美國施行普遍軍訓一事，杜魯門總統曾談稱：予意將普遍軍事訓練中之「軍事」一詞刪去，因軍事一詞所代表之意義，已包含於予心目中所謂訓練之中。陸軍部特於今日發行小冊一種，又力言普遍之軍事訓練之重要，據稱，普遍軍訓之大部份，將着重於體力之發展，此外并將增加有關宗教教育之課目。普遍軍訓中之一部份課程，已具有教育意味，惟教育僅為施行訓練時之副產品。訓練目的絕非於現有教育系統外，另樹相似之系統。普遍軍事訓練必須對國家安全有所貢獻，否則不必施行。</p>

<h3>亞洲國際會議　明春三月舉行　尼赫魯將晤甘地商談</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿六日電〕此間今日宣布：亞洲國際會議定於明年三月廿四日在此間開幕，至四月三日閉幕。請柬已向卅二國發出，但尚未接獲答覆，亦無一國表示不能參加。非亞洲國家中，僅埃及一國被邀參加。會議殆將由印度臨時政府副主席尼赫魯揭幕。籌備委會主席奈都夫人現已在佈置一切。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕關於亞洲各國人民將在德里舉行會議一事，頃由無黨派雜誌「時潮」加以評論稱：印度時時政府副主席尼赫魯最近所採取之政治手腕，其目的乃在發動其自身之泛亞洲運動，尼赫魯之計劃，具有超宗教與超種族之性質，其目的乃在組織共同的亞洲陣綫，對對付西方各國之剝削。以視日本之「大東亞」觀念，實迥然相異。該項計劃係真正的泛亞洲，其範圍至為博大，東至日本神道教徒，西至黎巴嫩基督教徒，均將包括在內。其所持觀點，頗為樂觀，認為亞洲所有人民，均能以博愛與諒解之心，携手合作。尼赫魯之計劃，一如其人所持觀念，實極為偉大。但尼赫魯是否認為泛亞洲聯邦能容忍巴基斯坦之存在，回教聯盟領袖真納念及泛亞洲聯邦將由印度教徒，為其領袖是否願意亞洲統一，凡此種種皆屬疑問云。真納認為尼赫魯一日為印度政府首長，回教即一日處於危險之中，耶路撒冷大主教對此，亦深以為然。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿六日電〕印度臨時政府總理尼赫魯，國大黨主席克里巴拉氏及該黨秘書長勞本沃，將於明日飛往加爾各答，與聖雄甘地討論現行政局。聞尼赫魯下週卻將返此，以便主持將於一月二日開幕之印度科學會議，各國科學家人皆將前來參加。</p>

<h3>小羅斯福返國　將撰蘇聯遊記　對杜魯門政策表不滿</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿六日電〕故總統羅斯福之公子奧里沃上校，偕其夫人在波蘭及蘇聯遊歷八星期後，頃於本日返抵此間。公子對晉謁史達林元帥一事，拒不宣佈其目的，僅證實史達林身體似極健康。按羅公子係徇美國「瞻望」圖報之請，而至蘇聯遊歷，今將為該雜誌撰述遊記六篇。聞內容大部份係關於蘇聯之復員情形。羅公子對美國外交政策，過去數度不表贊同，認為與其先父之理想不符，并主張美國外交政策，應由共和與民主兩黨領袖會商後訂定之，務需意見一致。羅公子將來發表之文字，當附加羅夫人在蘇聯所拍之照片，此項照片絕對未受檢查。</p>

<h3>英國駐西大使已奉召返倫敦　英政府首先實施聯大決議　西報指責英使有越軌運動</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕英國駐西班牙大使馬萊奉召回國，今日篛飛機抵此。聯合國大會在紐約通過決議，由會員各國召回駐西使節，以未不贊成弗朗哥政府，馬萊係聯合國被召回大使之第一人。</p>
<p>〔路透社馬德里廿六日電〕英大使馬萊已於今日啟程返國，馬德里報紙於日前發表使馬萊感覺不安之消息，指此間英大使館曾積極參加反弗朗哥運動，其實此間之英大使館於從事例有之社交活動時，雖曾與西班牙之各派人土接觸，惟就英記者所知，西班牙之反弗朗哥人士，仍以英美大使館，未敢積極同情彼等而不滿。西班牙之各反弗朗哥派，一年來其內部關係并未趨於好轉，迨英美法於三月四日發表宣言，表示希望弗朗哥政府自動下野，設立臨時政府以舉行普選，更使反弗朗哥派中之保王派大為憤怒。至七月八月間，各反弗朗哥派間之一致行動談判，幾已完全陷於停頓，而各派對於西班牙未來政府之形式，至今猶不能成立協議。至九月間，共黨即放棄與各派之合作而決定採取斷然之共和主義，於是西班牙之各反弗朗哥派，乃益形分散矣。</p>
<h3>戰後一大課題　日軍民遣返工作</h3>
<p>中國本部的三百萬人，已經遣送完畢。此外尚有一百萬人，原業是在東北方面的。由於國慰局勢的複雜，此輩日人之命運如何，尚在未定之天。</p>
<p>將數百萬日本俘虜及僑民自中國遣返日本，確實是一椿龐大和困難的工作，但是在中美雙方合作之下，大體上可以說已經「功德圓滿」了。</p>
<p>在日皇宣認無條件投降詔書，日軍放下武器那一天，也就是世界大戰和中日戰爭正式結束的那一天，在華日軍和日僑共有四百萬人，但是經過一年的努力之後，已經有三百萬人重島國了。所餘的一百萬人，原來是在滿洲（東九省）方面的。由於蘇聯政策深奧莫測，這一百萬人的遣返，一時還無從解決，美國方面也有無能為力之慨。</p>
<p>「世界報告週刊」特派員朗恩茲最近從上海發出一個報告，把日本軍民遣返工作的內情，說得很清楚，現在把其中的要點，　譯在後面。</p>
<p>遣返日本軍民的工作，是由中美合作在去年十二月間開始的，其方法，是先將他們有系統地解除武裝，并且逐步集中在一起。但是中國面積遼闊，日本軍民分佈極廣，所以不得不分區進行。當時決定道德處理華南。臺灣和越南方面，在三個多月的時間內，總共遣返日人六十萬人以上。其次是華中方面，總共遣返八十萬人以上。最後是華北，總共遣返五十五萬四千人左右，後者在最近始告完成。</p>
<p>在時行遣返工作的時候，對於日本僑民究竟深入中國達何程度的問題，獲得了一個頗可注目的結論：就是日軍和日僑的比例，是三與二。換言之，每遣返日本士兵三人，就遣返平民二人。日本軍兵遣返工作的進行，對於日本本身的影響，是兩重性的：一方面是一種普遍的慰藉之感，覺得分散在各地的國民終於回去了；另一方面，在經濟上卻引起了種種憂慮。</p>
<p>從好的方面講，許多家庭從此得以團聚了，多餘的人力可以應用到生產工作上去，政府在起草復興計劃的時候，也不致茫無所措了。這一點，使美國的威信提高了不少，因為美國和蘇聯不同，頗能恪守波茨坦宣言中所規定的責任。</p>
<p>但是在壞的方面講，遣返日本軍民的費用，大部份須由日本政府負担，這筆開支是相當浩大的。同時，在戰後日本支離破散的經濟機構中，要容納如許返國的軍民，也實在是一件棘手的事情。更有進者，糧食和住屋問題，也就更其嚴重起來了。可是壞的方面不論怎樣壞，日本人對於遣返工作的迅速進行，還是覺得值得的。所以不論支出如何浩大，還是希望從速把滿洲方面一百萬日本軍民，送回到本國來。可是這一件事比較複雜，因為有蘇聯牽入在內。</p>
<p>日本軍民自美軍控制區的迅速遣返，使日本人對於蘇聯的措施感覺不滿，這可以從日本人最近在東京蘇聯駐日大使館前舉行示威，要求加速遣返工作一點見之。蘇聯一向對於日本極為注意，并就共產主義的榮耀和蘇聯對日本人民的關懷大事宣傳，可是遣返工作的波折疊起，對於日本共產黨和蘇聯代表團的工作，顯然是一大打擊。</p>
<p>經過了許多次折衝之後，蘇聯最後已決定，每月自西比利亞東部一港遣返日人一萬至一萬五千名，（最近報載麥帥和蘇聯當局已成立每月遣返五萬人的協定—譯者），但是日本人還不能感到十分滿意，因為美國自中國大陸遣返日人時，工作的最高峰每日遣返者曾達一萬二千人之多呢。</p>
<p>還有一點使日本人不滿的，就是蘇聯準備先遣送日本平民，儘量延遲日俘的遣返工作。據各方估計，日軍之在蘇聯手中者，至少有八十萬人。美國方面認為其中有七十萬人。美國方面認為其中有七十萬人已從滿州運往西比利亞，在勞工營中工作，日本人認為這一點違背波茨坦宣言。同時照目前的辦法進行，遣送一百萬人至少需要幾年的時間。</p>
<p>今後的發展如何，當然不是任何人所能推測，因為局勢是隨時可能發生變化的。但是有一點卻非常值得重視，就是中國本部日本軍民的遣返工作，已告完成。東京方面一向稱之「中日事變」的戰爭，經過冗長的九個年頭之後，總算正正式式地結束了。（亞農譯自「世界報告週刊」）</p>
<h3>慶祝聖誕佳節　英王廣播詔書　以勇敢二字勉勵國人</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕英王喬治六世本日與王室在聖得里漢宮，歡渡聖誕佳節，共時晚餐，火雞與棗子布丁為主要菜肴。餐畢，英王即步入書房，在金質話筒前向全國人民廣播聖誕詔書。曼麗王太后伊麗莎白王后暨公主等均在座恭聽。英王以「勇敢」二字勗勉全國。其言有日本日為聖誕節，朕與王后在宮中與王天之驕子團聚一堂，共渡佳節，咸以英帝國為遍及全球之大家庭為念。大戰使世界瘡　滿目，到處瓦礫，政治家負有安定世界之重任，一年業努力不懈，洵非易事。唯有繼續忍耐，并出以善意，世界始能恢復常態。當英國遭遇轟炸時，吾人已表現吾人之精神，今後當仍能以忍耐與紀律，重新表現同樣之精神。吾人今日以自由人身份，在和平之環境下慶祝聖誕佳節。人民在日常生活中固仍感缺乏必需用品，但吾人不應過份擔心目前之困難，吾人應念及偉大之將來。動員基督之精神，補救吾人之日常生活，并救濟各處之苦難人民云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕坎特伯莢大主教今日發表聖誕獻詞，籲請人民加重信心。謂時局多難，世界各地道德的與物體的情況險惡，每個人與每個人之精神受其壓迫，吾人安能於此時尚言加重信心乎。惟聖誕告訴吾人如何取得和平與喜樂，人類則無法自行創造和平喜樂。基督降臨施與和平喜樂，人類必須謙卑接受。</p>

<h3>國際女魔王　蛇蝎老美人</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕尼斯城流動偵察隊大隊長谷丹日昨捕獲一蛇蝎美人，有殺人二十餘名之嫌疑。被捕者為唐荳蘭夫人，或稱伊為男爵夫人，亦有尊之為候爵夫人者。其五十歲之大部份光陰，消磨於中東方面，尤其是敘利亞與黎巴嫩方面。一九三六年，其丈夫貝爾男爵在敘利亞沙漠中某旅館內被人暗殺，身中十九刀，該旅館為男爵所設。唐夫人代夫伸怨，結果捕獲嫌疑犯兩人。但法國軍官兩人公開疑心兇手即為唐夫人本人。不久之後，該兩軍官外出，幾被唐夫人之汽車輾斃。該兩人訴之警局，亦無結果。厥後唐荳蘭再嫁一回教徒，住於阿刺伯國王之親戚家內，形同軟禁。一九三九年，潛往回教聖地麥加，以謀在該地出售來歷不明之大批珠寳與鑽石。事前曾勾引一公使館某職員，故得順利出境。抵麥加後，又謀斃阿剌伯酋長一人，回王大怒，將伊判處死刑，但伊神通廣大，又束脫至北非。在第二次大戰期間，竟被視為政治犯，而獲得保護。今年八月，唐荳蘭偕其子（尼斯城某報記者）前來尼斯，開始享樂。直至最近母子始以販運黃金被捕，但其子旋即獲釋。偵緝大隊長谷丹曾在敘利亞·黎巴嫩及北非全境向伊跟蹤。據談：「她是一個最危險的婦人，她知道怎樣用毒藥或匕首。」聞死於伊手中之男子達十五至廿人，但警察局對於全案內容，保守秘密，大約須俟該犯解抵巴黎後，再發表詳情。</p>

<p>一一五號機毀於貼繞河塔廟之小浜中，機首已切落，右翼折斷，尾部分裂，但機身尙屬完整。其着地狀態完全如正常停歇一般。河塔廟西半部已被震毀，瓦礫遍地，廟中泥塑「皂隷」一具已跌覆地面，大殿中廟神則仍端坐無恙，廟後空地正對殘機，地上文件紙張之碎片到處狼籍，機首切斷處並發現名片及空白支票牙籤等物，記者並拾獲染有泥濘之「情書」一封，日期爲本月二十三日，當係機中女客寫後未發者，內書「親愛的××，行期老是不能決定，眞是心焦……你的××。」讀之令人酸鼻。空地樹枝上尙掛有殘破之衣服，機中剩留之衣箱等物正由中航公司人員淸理堆集於廟前草坪上。</p>

<h3>轟然巨響火光燭天　小學校長死裏逃生</h3>
<p>河塔廟雖傾毀不堪，幸無傷亡，惟該鄕私立華東小學校長孫建瑾，則於死裏逃生。孫校長每晚住宿於廟內大殿西部，前晚的八時餘，彼已深入夢鄉，突聞轟然巨響，從夢中驚醒。時床帳已下墜，足部覺被重物壓住，倉卒之間探首外望，則見火光燭天。當時彼絕未想到係飛機墜地，而以爲是雷霹起火，乃急忙起牀披衣奪路而出，此時心慌意亂，加之東殿已毀，竟不能辨識方向，後來稍稍定心，始沿廟後竹園繞至隔壁民家，會同鄕民鳴鑼營救。孫校長昨與記者談及當時情形，而露笑容、並稱：「幸而向來睡臥時頭東脚西，否則頭部被壓，亦必喪生」云云。</p>
<h3>路上雨紛紛　行人欲斷魂</h3>
<p>記者等在週圍巡視時，已有罹難者之家屬兩人（男性）前來認看，顯然彼等所欲尋覓之親屬已爲屍首之一，因此熱淚盈眶。縣政府方面此時亦已派人前來料理，但至記者離去時止，（下午二時）屍體尙未能移運。時公路旁歇有出差汽車兩輛，車中有一女性，淚眼張望，見記者等即啓車門立雨中詢問，據稱係慶華顏料公司總經理樂作霖之妻，其夫曾來電謂搭中航一一五號機來滬，今晨得悉飛機失事後，曾至各處醫院查詢均未發現，恐已遇難云。言時泣不成聲。</p>

<h3>中山醫院內　療傷十五人　俞鵬業已不治身死　張椿華　薛錦帆　傷最輕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日午後三時半，中國航空公司醫務主任荷愛醫師（C.F.Hoey）曾赴中山醫院探視從該公司兩架失事機中、所救出之受傷旅客。中國航空公司於前晚出事後，迄昨晨止，曾先後送達傷者三批，共十五人。第一批七人：兪鵬（重傷），趙繼興（男），腎裂傷，小便出血，頭顱骨折，在昏迷中。劉騰驤（男）腦震傷，陳阿二（男）右腿斷，張琦雲（女）傷頭部及左腿，閔婉貞（女）傷頭部及膝部，無名氏（女）送院至今，一直在昏迷狀態中。第二批四名：張椿華（男）左足脛腓骨斷，吳榮炳（男）左手尺骨折斷，薛錦帆（男）傷臂部，比較殺輕，潑勞士（Preus,男，即一一五號機正駕駛員）頭面部重傷，在昏迷狀熊中。又無名小孩二名，其一已於昨晚六時五十分死亡，不足週歲。另一兩腿折斷，約一歲餘。第三批兩人：王孝德（男，係一一五號機無綫電員）膝部關節脫位，股骨脛腓骨共折四段，腦裂傷，病情甚重，徐維龍（男）頭面部傷。</p>
<p>前述十五名傷者中，兪鵬業於昨晨不治身死。無名氏女性及王孝德延至昨晚。亦因傷重，已入彌留狀態。餘尙佳。其中尤以第一一五號機中之搭客張椿華及薛錦帆二人，受傷最輕。猶能獲得醫師之允許，與記者作片刻之談話。</p>
<p>張椿華爲唱武丑之平劇藝員，僅右耳及左跟略受傷，現住二樓某號二等病房中。其時適有周姓女友一人，正在股股慰問。張在漢口大舞台與李少春同台演唱，至十六日期滿。原可與李同時返滬，因舞台方面尚有包銀未克如期付張，太延至二十五日方獲啓程。原擬抵滬後略事休息，立即轉往天津演唱，豈料適逢失事。</p>
<p>據張吿：飛機抵滬上空，的在七時左右，彼適在睡鄉中。迨在極度衝撞中震醒，飛機業已出事。張從昏迷狀熊中醒來，猶未知已受傷，待欲起立，方發覺左腿已折傷，輾轉反則於機旁，迄午夜以後，方有人來救護。</p>
<p>薛錦帆爲百貨商，自渝來滬辦貨，同行共有夥伴六人，僅薛一人獲倖免。薛坐於中部機位上，僅知無法降落，初不料有他。迨最後飛機突然墮落，即吿昏迷。醒來時，見已被拋出機外，躺於河灘上。旁有婦人一名，薛本人類相助之良能，尙圖上前救助，豈知竟係一死屍。是時乃恍然覺悟自身亦已受傷，力疲倒地。救入醫院後，經過情形甚佳，親友等已數往探視。</p>
<p>第一一五號機美籍駕駛員潑勞士傷勢頗重。中航公司荷愛醫師入室探視時，仍不能言語。頭部臉頰等處均紥有紗布綢帶。左腿骨折斷。荷愛醫師當囑咐院中醫師，將潑勞士換入最佳病房，僱一特別護士，必要時不斷輸血，用X光檢查胸腹內部有無傷處。並稱：醫藥費絕無問題，一切當由中航公司照付。若潑勞士卒能獲救，殆將爲失事三客機中唯一得救之機師矣。</p>

<h3>中國航空公司　發表失事原因　試圖盲目降陸不幸墮毀　兩機載客總數共六十人</h3>
<p>中國航空公司於昨日發表此次失事原由之公吿如下：</p>
<p>前晚（十二月廿五日）中國航空公司損失自渝飛滬客機兩架，實屬深可驚悼，第一四〇號C-47式機，由飛機師J.M.Greenwood駕駛，副飛機師劉林森飛行，報務員金鏗隨行，上午十時十五分自重慶珊瑚壩起飛，沿途應經停武昌·南京。又第一一五號C-46機，由飛機師R.B.Preus駕駛，副飛機師譚興錚飛行，報務員王孝德隨行，上午十時卅分自重慶白市驛起飛，沿途經停武昌，即直飛上海，兩機午後離開武昌，間隔的十五分鐘先後續飛，當時</p>
<p>京滬兩地氣候均尙適於飛機降落，洎至飛近南京時，京滬兩處氣候均陡生變化，因武昌機塲缺乏夜航設備，時巳不容飛回，而京滬兩處機塲均有夜航設備可供夜晚降落，尤其江灣飛機塲，具有盲目降落及夜航設備更較完善，本應經停南京之第一四〇號機即試圖在京降落，但以氣候關係，該處機塲全不能見，該飛機師遂續飛上海，第一一五號飛機抵達滬空的在下午五時卅分，第一四〇號飛機抵達時的後此一小時，其時滬地氣候與南京亦復相同，第</p>
<p>一四〇號飛機首先試圖在江　機場利用盲目降落設備着陸，該飛機師在該處上空盤旋的一小時餘，幾經試騐因飛機上無綫電儀器部份失靈，終無法利用此種盲目降落，雖能與指揮塔通訊，但因電力太弱，不能與盲目降落設備發生聯絡，又復續試一小時餘，確知降落江灣爲不可能，除飛往龍華外，更無他途，及試岡在龍華機塲降落，能見度仍等於零，數次嘗試，終遂通知指揮塔因機上汽油已罄，惟有强迫降落，在試行降落中於矯正着陸方向之際，撞毀於機塲西南端，時爲七時五十五分。至於第</p>
<p>一一五號飛機在江灣上空盤旋，已能與盲目降落設備聯絡，但有時不甚淸晰，在此等情形之下，降落亦難期安全，遂於九時許飛離江灣至龍華機塲，此時天氣略有變化，能見度漸次淸晰，經屢次試圖降落，其最後一次嘗試已幾於成功，僅須再繞一週改變方向，不意正在此際，竟爾隊毀於機塲外西南一英里黃家渡河廟塔，其原因尙未盡明瞭。該第一一五號飛機盤旋江灣上空的經三小時又卅分，前兩小時內空中尙有第一四〇號機及另一架中國航空公司飛機。</p>
<p>第一四七號</p>
<p>又其他部份飛機兩架，中國航空公司之第一四七號機已於七時四十分在江灣機塲安全降落，當一四〇號飛機在龍華試岡降落之際，中國航空公司主管及機航部份人員，均在塲守候，本塲消防隊救護車醫護人等亦均召集聽用，並經報吿市府警局派有警察及消防隊蒞塲，以備萬一，故失事時得及時救助。至於第一一五號機則於失却聯絡後一小時許始得失事之消息，其時美軍及美海軍均協助搜尋，水上警察及美海軍均派出船艇多隻。</p>
<p>沿江偵察</p>
<p>計第一四〇號機載客二十七人，機員三人。第一一五號機載客三十三人，機員三人，受傷者均已送入醫院，不幸死亡爲數頗重，乘客姓名及其他詳細情形，當探明續爲披露。</p>
<h3>新婚夫婦成同命鴛鴦　國大一代表妻子雙亡</h3>
<p>萬國殯儀館裏，死者靜靜躺着，有不少屍身上已堆滿了鮮花。在中國殯儀館，情形就不同了，整堆的屍身績在一起，血·泥·雨水·把衣服染得己經難以辨認。無窮悲悼的家屬們，有時祗能從一只高跟鞋上追認出自己親屬的面目！哭聲震地，慘不忍睹。</p>
<p>中央機罷難者夏昌鈎，是糧食邵專員，與其妻夏吳淑貞同時遇難。夏昌鈞死狀尤慘，一足已斷。前糧政特派員楊錫志昨天曾親自往認。夏夫人的親屬者見遺骸，痛哭暈厥！夏氏夫婦還是本年五月結婚的，不想未滿一年，竟成同命鴛鴦！中央機副機師劉林森，也在失事時殞生，而他也祗訂婚了兩個月，昨天劉的未婚妻曾去認屍，更是悽絕人寰！</p>
<p>此次瀋陽國大代表遼寗人趙某之夫人趙老太太，即趙王玉賢，偕其公子趙繼興，由渝乘機赴京探望　代表，因氣候變化，改飛上海，不意亦遭此刧，母子同命。趙氏次公子仲興，已到萬國殯儀館辨認屍號，料理喪務，並已急電促南京趙代表來滬。</p>
<p>萬國殯儀當　，有一個人認出了一位死者是他的親戚張琦雲，但是，在中山醫院六號室三十號病牀上，張綺雲正安心躺着。她還能說話，她說，她的確是張琦雲。後來知道是誤會的。</p>
<p>美軍憲兵MP前夜在風雨中駕駛吉普車急速把傷者送醫院時，不想車行過急，路上掩傷行人李陳氏一名，撞傷頭部，結果連失事傷者一同送到了中山醫院。</p>
<p>在中山醫院，有一位罹難者的身邊，找到了兩張飛機票，一張的姓名是兪鵬，另一張的姓名是張枕江，以致姓名無從確定。</p>
<p>在中航機一一五號殘骸旁邊，救護員檢起了一個穿花布衣的小弟弟，謝天謝地，他竟一點沒有受傷！記者到達中山醫院時，他已經安然送抵院中，睡着了。他自己言說，名字呌王弟弟，今年四歲。他的家長是誰，他是從那裏來的，現在都無法知道。在聖誕前夕，他也許還是一個受盡寵愛的快快樂樂的小天使——現在，却已成為飄零天涯的一個孤兒！</p>
<p>刦後餘生王弟弟居然無恙</p>
<h3>交部派員來滬　慰問死難家屬　並督導兩公司作安全措施</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕交部對此次失事極爲注意，已派航政司長李博侯，民用航空司長戴安國，兼程赴滬，慰問受傷乘客，及死難家屬，並督導兩航空公司作緊急安全措施。値茲冬令冰霧季節，凡遇氣候惡劣，視綫不佳時，一律停航，以策安全。</p>
<h3>第一四〇號下墮時　撞毀場上空機</h3>
<p>第一四〇號中國航空公司渝滬班機墮毀於龍華機塲大跑道附近，其殘骸昨晨已由公司方面用起重機淸除，前晚運救傷亡，於黑暗中不愼傾覆於跑道附近之紅十字會第六號救護車，亦已拖起。墮落處所草坪上尙可見零星機件散佈，並有破爛之衣服鞋襪一堆，血漬模糊。機中乘客有携帶四川廣橘者，今亦與其主人同遭妻慘命運，橘皮處處，尙未掃除。</p>
<p>該機失事之夜，在本市上空曾翱翔二三小時，終因汽油吿罄，機首遂向地面直衝，着地時並碰傷停歇於該處另一飛機之翼部，其本身則翻覆數匝而毀。</p>
<p>當該兩機在市空盤旋時，該公司機航組主任吳士，總飛機師麥唐納，營業組主任高大經，上海售票處處長吳志洪，以及美方董事社威迪，及各資深飛機師等，並均在機塲佇望，由總飛機師麥唐納親自到指揮塔指揮，該公司總經理沈德燮，汎美航空公司代表賴諾先生及薩賚德博士，旋亦先後趕到，督同辦理救助事宜，直至翌晨迄未稍休。</p>

<h3>一部份房捐建設捐　計算有問題　參議會財委會議決　請市政府核復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會財政委員會昨午假虹橋俱樂部舉行第六次會議，繼續討論稅收等問題，並由財局副局長胡文元出席解釋。該會討論事項：（一）關於財政局「三十五年度田賦征收實物折征國　實施辦法」曁「征收田賦臨時淸查糧籍暫行辦法草案」曾公推參議員路式導，王維駰審查，審查意見提交市府參考。據胡副局長解釋：本市田賦糧籍，向爲書吏（即俗稱地皮鬼）霜持，目前該局伕照上項辦法，派員淸查，實施以來，成績甚佳，亦無騷擾悄事，大的明春二月間鄧可開始征收。</p>
<p>（二）本市市民，商聯會及候補參議員等，均向市參議會提議，本市秋季房捐及市政建設捐，財局並非根據前工部局二十六年份之租値計算，請予糾正案。該委員會決機將此項意見送請市府核復。又胡副局長說明：屠宰稅法，筵席及娛樂稅法曁房捐條例，均已奉國府修正，與現行制度，頗多出入，財局根據本市征收經騐，感覺有未盡適合地方情形之處，曾經瀝陳理由，電請中央再予修正，此次並預備提請市參議會第二次大會硏究，若照新稅法實施征收，估計本市稅收，每月將减少三十億元。又頃奉行政院令，地方政府有三種特別稅可以課征，但須經民意機關通過，卅六年度市政建設損及旅棧捐等仍擬列入預算，即以此項命令爲根據</p>

<h3>溝通蘇州河　兩岸交通　計劃添建　各處橋樑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市浦西地區，以蘇州河橫滯於中，致形成河南河北兩區，西藏路以東跨河橋樑較多，故南北交通尙稱便利，虹口一帶遂較繁榮。自西藏路以西僅新閘橋一處，可以跨河，因此閘北市面甚爲冷落。且自閘北以趨滬西與南市者，多沿東區各橋越河，黃浦區之交通爲之增繁。現南京路中正路車輛至爲擁擠，一部分成因亦在於此。</p>
<p>本市工務局局長趙祖康，有鑒於此，除已擬就蘇州河兩岸交通計劃書，準備逐步實施外，特於昨日下午偕同該局道路處處長呂季方，結構處處長朱國洗，前往實地勘查，將該局近擬之溝通蘇州河南北兩岸交通工程計劃，密切硏究。聞計劃內容計包括添建江西路·恒豐路·福建路·長壽路各處橋樑及橋址問題，整修蘇州路全路路面，及駁岸，並整理拓寬江西路·成都路·華盛路·恒豐路·中正北二路·長籌路及廣肇路等主要道路。全部計劃壽款的九十餘億元，即將提請市參議會核議。本計劃完成後，閘北一帶受益地畝的八九千畝，即以地便增値一項而論，最少可達四五百億元，對於黃浦區車輛擁擠一節，大可解救不少。</p>
<h3>海輪進口誤期　吳淞口海漢輸艙底受捐　大華輪改今日下午駛甬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕天氣惡劣，影響外海航行甚鉅，船期因之不準，昨日雖有一部外海船隻出口，惟至外銅沙長江口，尙須待機而行。茲悉美國總統輪船公司之麥迪遜總統號，原定廿四日到滬，因受天氣影響，聞須今日始可抵埠，世界班孟羅總統號，亦改明午離滬，除原船乘客赴南洋及歐洲者外，本市登輪赴紐約之乘客計有二十六名。戈登將軍號，昨午起駛菲律濱，兼灣香港，本市乘客香港四十三人，小呂宋十三人。該公司經理之United　StatesLine福門勝利號，洛波脫斯洛凡得號二輪，亦因天氣關係而迄未到滬，至昨日傍晚，尙無確訊。滬甬綫班輪亦誤期，招商局江靜號，昨自甬返滬，應於晨八時許即可到埠，昨亦延至中午十二時許始到，昨日下午五時許照常駛甬。平安局大華輪遇霧遲至昨日下午二時到埠，不及開甬，改今日下午二時駛寗波，故下班亦改本星期日開甬。如天氣放晴，下星期仍照二四六班出口。招商局海漢輪，自津返滬，於二十五日晨二時許，將進吳淞口時，前艙底不知觸及何物，轟然一聲，全船震動，因之頭艙底微受損傷，略有侵水，前日下午進口後，泊金利源碼頭起卸來貨，俟貨卸淸加以檢騐修理，駛津期爲之延遲數天。此次大霧中，對長江及下游各綫船舶，不受影響，照常行駛。</p>
<h3>行總空運大隊　元旦開始飛航　週內將有二架抵滬</h3>

<p>據該隊負責人表示：該隊計劃以後每機每日飛行二班，計每一路綫每日可遝輸物資十二噸，一月三百噸，自明年一月中起，希望每一路綫每月可運一千噸。但行總當局以空運費用甚高，不擬大量運輸，僅以急需善後救濟物資，並該處無其他遝輸工具可達者爲限。根據中國航空公司路綫，空運費用與水運或車運比較，如自廣州至桂林，空運每噸須費三十八萬三千元，水遝每噸十三萬一壬七百九十七元。如自廣州經桂林至漢口，每噸計費一百萬元，由鐵路運輸每噸四十一萬一千元。</p>
<p>該隊廣州主持人現正硏究並將決定運輸物資之原則及工作計劃</p>

<p>存底充足店銷轉懈　米市已漸次安定　油價昨亦直綫下瀉</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日米市穩定。北市共到三二三〇担，南市共到五三二八担。價格方面：南市在議價之下，北市亦僅上熟米略有黑市，初爲六萬七千元，後降至六萬五千元。黑市發生之原因爲天雨來貨較少，及拉船遝糧之謠言所致。前傳產地米價較本市爲高，亦爲事實，惟悉產地之漲價，乃受上海米市動盪之剌激所致，如上海米價穩定，不足爲慮。本市民間存米，有關方面估計至少有三十萬担，而市府能控制之米，包括在滬及途中者，殆不下二百萬担，善爲支配，可供應本市四五月。展望民食前途，甚爲樂觀。</p>
<p>又訊，赤金下降，銀根甚緊，人心轉軟，店蝟驟懈，北粳成交雖稀，暗中亦挫千餘元，南粳供應仍多，回跌二千餘元，秈米到銷依然寥寥，白元陰元均低落二千元之譜，形趨止漲轉跌之狀，油市則動盪劇烈，開盤後直綫下游，生油狂瀉一萬二三千元，豆汕猛跌三五千地，蔴油隨之下降三四千元，淸油則慘跌萬元有强，豆餅台灣汕頭吸胃不濃，回低二三百元，麵粉亦趨平疲，統粉回小三五百元，洋粉平定，麩皮亦回小一二百元，黃豆本街消化尙可，汕廠進蝟平常，結果軋小五五百元，赤豆零化頗殷，盤漲千元，彔豆南洋去化仍續，明定暗緊，挺昂千餘元，苞米靑島收購蟬聯，價格穩定，蠶豆貨稀牢硬，紅糧來去兩不見旺，小麥到不敵銷，依然挺秀，芝蔴站局。生仁廣帮消化轉淡，本街亦平平，高貨回小千餘元，中下則下跌二三千元。</p>
<p>又訊，自金鈔市價連日波動後，其他各貨價格，大部隨之上升，尤其民生必需品方面，食米與麵粉二項，均已超過評議價格，市政當局鋻於悄勢嚴重，已予嚴密注意，於各市塲加派幹員暗中監視，如有塲外擅做黑市交易者，立予嚴懲，故昨今兩市之段機騷動，已漸見歛跡，據社會局負責人對記者稱，決定於本週內召開米麵兩業評價審議會，並予竭力設法協助疏通物資來源，務使供求平衡，同時更加强監管各市塲銷售情形，務望絲毫物資不流入黑市，對於正當商人，除予以合理之利潤外，隨時輔導其納入正軌。</p>
<h3>實銷逢低吸進　金價疲而復漲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨雖低而多盤，空方有補而多回頭，晨開三一九萬，央行即加壓力，立告下降，低價退至三〇六萬至三〇八萬之間，而後告定，乘低有實銷維持，買氣忽股，盤旋而漲，十時後央行以三一八萬之價配給三六條，此際曾見三二〇萬萬價，不久央行再旋壓力，曾再降至三一〇萬以內，但賣風甚暫，供源一止，買氣突振，隔夜浮空急補，而步漲至三三四萬，午刻回低至三二七萬左右徘徊，惟形勢已見穩定，午後隔日交割曾扳高至三四三萬，仍遭央和地壓迫，急切回跌至三二五萬左右。最後仍站三三二萬以上，較前收回升十三萬，飾金三五萬五，銀元平平，暗拆銀根稍鬆，暗息在一角半至二角之間。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦被動微升，美鈔晨開五九〇〇元，低價退至五八〇〇元，此後即逐漸回升至六四〇〇元，午刻在六一〇〇元至六三〇〇元之間盤旋，午後初穩後平，結果與前收相彷彿，港票受港申電上升影響，未熊趨升，反吿先穩後疲，但結果尙升三十元，港匯一二三〇元，印匯一五五〇元，英匯二〇五〇〇元，均有供少求。</p>
<h3>建國銀行　缺九億頭寸　被停止交換</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市南京路二〇〇號建國銀行上海分行，昨日終因在票據交換所軋缺頭寸的九僮元，卒被交換所停止交換處分。該行並於大門口張貼佈吿：略稱：「本分行近因銀根奇緊，放出款項，不易收回，迫得暫停交換，收欠還存，並已重請總行調款接濟。一俟部署就緒，立即恢復原狀。所有本行各地分行及本部支行，仍照常營業，特此通告。查該行於民國卅年五月，由孫麟方等在渝發起創立。最初資本二百萬元，其後陸續增資三次，至卅四年十二月，增資爲一萬萬元，卅五年三月廿六日，成立滬行。六月一日，總處亦遷滬辦公。六月十日，滬行正式開業，並持有財錢戊字三二〇四號營業執照。現除重慶總行外，並於西安，內江，設有分行。本市除南京路分行外，尙有南京西路七九五號，及林森中路九六三號支行兩處，現任董事長兼總經理爲孫麟方，滬行經理爲樊雨攀。</p>
<h3>川幫銀行　營業穩定　外傳不穩不確</h3>
<p>頃據四川銀錢業鉅子吿記者，關於最近外傳川帮銀行，均有不穩之說，殊非事實，蓋川地銀行業在滬所設分行，其一部份常年放款，均由總行撥付，故每至年終結算，此一部份放款，只須代為收回歸還總行，故分行銀根緊縮則有之，但極無週轉不靈之現象，又川帮銀行，其平時所經營業務，向多墨守舊章，頗爲正常，極少越出銀行正當業務範圍之外，因之近來每日交換金額，均有加倍之準備，以防萬一，至鈑日報戴被動搖之銀行，實不能列入川帮銀行，因彼等均係在抗戰時期僑居重緊之外省人所新設立者，外間不明眞相，混爲一談，實一憾事。</p>
<h3>柏油銷場發動　市價突飛猛進</h3>
<p>柏汕自各處產新後，迄將兩月，產銷尙能平衡。最近　燭用塲漸見發動，上週爲始，所到不足供銷遠甚，市面飛黃騰達。本市行家均無貨應市，羣向各產地採辦，然亦無濟於事，市價每担突漲四五萬元，且尙無貨以應。聞漢口市上巳加起二萬元左右，亦到不敷銷。蘭溪等處漲起三萬元光景，而漲風最健者則爲嘉興本車。據昨日得狀處當話，每担己售開十八萬元。如是照一週前已漲四萬有餘矣。本市售價逐日調整。今已加售禾本柏汕十八萬五千元，內坪柏油十七萬元，龍尖柏油十六萬元。的干柏油十五萬四千元，麻城柏油十四萬八千元。</p>

<h3>華股隨金價進退　市况似漸趨堅俏</h3>
<p>華股昨仍龍金價爲進退，初疲繼堅，證券幫多頭逢低加碼，俘空有補，有以致之，晨開以人心仍怯而見低，開後經一七九號七六號一五二號一九〇號二三三號一五五號來進，金市回升至三二〇萬，永紗盤升至六〇五元，八九號力拋現永紗，二〇三號二一一號二三三號一九九號四七號咸售，金市復退至三一〇萬以下，一五二號一度斬多，復低落至五八〇元內，此後大事盤旋，十一時後，金價回好，二二九號一七一號二一八號一四二號，七六號二三二號連續買進，運水紗穿出六一〇元後，乹忽起，縱有盤旋，無奈金市軋空，二二九號一七七號一二號等咸納，近午軋空更殷，臨收更以高價結束，結果較前收計永紗信和升半成，勤興微降，新光小升，景福美亞華學則漲半成不到，冷股　安跌一成强，火柴升半成，餘均微升，遞交新光平，勤與跌一成，華豐微升，水紗美亞信和各升半成，午後因金市趨昂，上塲即吿狂躍，遞水紗升至六六四元，現永紗見六五〇元後，二一一號六二號八五號一七一號一九八號一五二號一六二號陸續供售，金價亦急降，乃回至六三〇元內，此時有九七號二一二號來進，而多掙扎，惟七六號一四號一五二號紛售，遷水紗低至六一二元，經二二號等買進而轉定，二三二號一八〇號七六號一四五號二二三號陸續來進，臨收曾升至六四〇元，而後回平，結果較前收計永紗美亞華豐各升半成，勤興微降，而信和景福新光微升，遞交永紗華鋻升半成弱，美亞信和新光均吿微降，勤興跌一成，（午前成交價），冷股大通微升，火柴漲半成，麗安跌成半，餘者絕少做開，塲外各股尙形平定</p>
<p>外股昨稍平和，各股榮辱互見，大體尙呈徘徊，結果較前牧計會德　回好半成，怡紗英聯怡啤鋼業紙業微升，餘者均見微降。</p>
<h3>業中人迫於銀根　和持雙馬見新低價</h3>
<p>昨日紗市繼續在落，金鈔雖跌後回升，紗價仍難立穩，業中人迫於銀根，一意求售，客銷冷落之至，是以二十支以上各紗又小十萬，重磅特雙爲已降至二百十五萬，爲近月之低聲。</p>
<h3>紗管新方案　意見已接近</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於穩定棉紗市塲方案，六區棉紡公會會員大會，對政府所提供之六點辦法，不盡同意。昨日上午九時，特由該公會理事長王啓宇，常務理事榮鴻元，榮一心，唐星海，郭棣活等代表，往行政院辦公處進謁宋院長，吳市長亦在座。常對六點辦法有所商洽。據悉：雙方意見，已吿接近。今日下午二時，六區棉紡公會，再將召開會員大會，俾便報吿與宋院長會談經過，並付討論。又五時正，紡管會將在市府召開會議，整個方案，即將有所決定云。</p>
<h3>中紡負責人談　明年增產方針</h3>
<p>據中紡公司負責人稱，中紡公司自成立後，經不斷努力，現已共擁有紗錠二百餘萬枚，爲全國所有紗錠額之二分之一，其中以上海爲重心，計佔一百二十萬紗錠以上，决爲天津中紡公司，共計七廠，係接收敵僞紡織工廠十六單位所改糾，共有三十二萬紗錠，再次爲靑島，有三十萬紗錠，截至目前爲止，開工者約爲總數十分之六以上，中紡上海公司共有紡織印染廠十九單位，因受電力限制，開工者僅五十六萬餘紗錠，產棉期即屆，該公司已派員分赴各產棉區採購國棉，據預計本季國內採棉總數約五百萬担，除供各地自需外，流向市塲者不過一百萬担之　，該公司本期收購國棉目標爲八十萬担，然尙不敷生產原料所需之半數，故仍須以外匯收購美棉，據悉：中紡明年度增產計劃之步驟則爲（一）自置發電機，現正積極進行裝置小型透平發電機四架於中紡第十六廠，總發電量四千　，僅够供該廠所需電力，將來將繼續向行政院物資供應局洽購發電機裝置，（二）儘量收　國棉，節省外匯，求原料之自供自足云。</p>
<h3>公債疲落</h3>
<p>公債昨稍見疲，雜牌更怯，大戶求供不一，統丙晨開一三二〇元，經六〇四室五五二室六一四室來進，逐漸扳高至一四四〇元以上，結果較前收微降三十元，甲乙跌一二〇元，統丁統戊各降七十元，成交的四百餘萬。</p>
<h3>籌募勝利公債帳款　限本年底結束</h3>
<p>中央銀行國庫局頃獲財政部函，略以籌募卅一·卅二·兩同盟勝利公債，早經結束，惟各省市經辦機構所整各項費用單據，前因交通阻礙，多未按時寄部，致對此類帳款，亦未能淸結，如尙有代整卅一·卅二兩年同盟勝利公債各費用單據，限於本年內寄部，逾期此帳即擬結束，茲悉：該局巳轉知各受委行局遵照云。</p>

<h3>鑫鎖關躍馬記</h3>
<p>— 西安八日航訊　本報特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>深夜到耀縣，城外雖有小店，但無法住宿，非叩關入城不可。此時天色如墨，伸手不見指，荒源夜沈，四野惟有犬聲吠寒。</p>
<p>耀縣城係傍漆水而築，垣堞甚高，入城須過漆水，而此岸復有柵門，欲叩關必先叩柵門。所謂碉堡綫者，離城僅十餘華里。上午在三原，其軍隊中有人吿我：「你到耀縣時，或許尙可聞槍聲，剛才有電話，共軍正在打打綫。」我現在到此「重地」，時己深夜，預想必然刁斗森嚴，於是打好如何賺關的主意，把毛氈搭在肩上，持手電筒探路前進。</p>
<p>夜賺耀關　紅纓槍下柵門開</p>
<p>走了一段路，即聞黑暗中大聲問口令，順手電光看過去，乃是一桿紅纓槍，身穿黑衣的民衆自衛隊，但見他橫槍站在柵門口，攔住去路。向他說明來處及即須入城的意思。這紅纓槍回答說：『這柵門是鎖住的。你到北頭去看。」於是再望北走一段路，又碰到紅纓槍。我想如果也鎖住了，必須設法要他啓鎖，不料柵門虛掩着，同紅纓槍說了幾句簡短的話。聽說我來自三原，遂毫無留雞地拉開柵門。</p>
<p>從平坦的石橋上渡漆水，上一條很陡的長坡，長坡盡處就是關得鐵緊的城門。呌關後有一個人頭自門縫中露出來與我對話。我如與他說上海記者，他必然弄不淸，必然不開門，乃對他說我是這裏專員公署的，自三原回城，有要緊公事，看樣子並不如想像中的森嚴。正在交涉，後面又來兩個軍人，他們代替了我的位置，向着那個頭以命令口吻發話，要他開關。門漸漸拉開，只見那個頭是一個荷槍實彈的士兵。</p>
<p>我們快步入關，城中毫無燈光，靜寂如死，一路在街角巷口，又碰到不少紅纓槍。賴一位軍人的帮助，給我碰開了一家浴池兼客店的門，店人睡眼惺忪，齒間嗤嗤作響，給我疊被泡茶，看看這客店的景象，知道所謂「陝北門戶」的耀縣，社會生活的貧苦。水是鹹的，彼是黑的，炕是凉的。加之滿天雪意，益增悽愴。</p>
<p>宋將韓琦，范仲淹曾開府延安，以禦三邊。所謂百二秦關，成楡道上的金鎖即其中之一。防邊於百二秦關之外，當時是遠戊生活。形勢失利時，范仲淹曾在關內的耀縣開府，其時稱耀州。「小范老子腹中自有數萬甲兵」，耀縣人亦十分景仰范仲淹。現在的縣政府即是其開府所在，叱咤西陲的一代名將，他升堂點兵的地方仍在，現在額匾爲「景范堂」，成爲縣政府的法庭。庭院迫窄，有老柏一株，光綫黯淡，面對城中心的鼓樓，即在百步以外。</p>
<p>使人感到昔時邊城戎鼓的情調，宛然聞金戈鐵馬之聲。</p>
<p>然而耀縣在關中，不是漢唐的邊城，但東漢亦有西羗，整個關中形爲邊地。腹地邊城，時移景遷，己不覺數千年。城外漆沮二水，流聲潺潺，道盡滄桑。它一向離開長安「遠」，現在雖然通了鐵道，可是仍然交通困難。耀縣人終於追緬着古代，信仰神話和傳說。</p>

<h3>神話之城</h3>
<p>耀縣也有一個碑林，一個有心人集藏着六十幾方石碑，一間獨門屋，黑暗無光，彷彿如洞。其間都是北魏造像記，筆緻怪誕橫逸，不似龍門造像記中還有若干淸俊秀拔的東西。但有兩塊極完整的千佛碑，這不能去比雲岡或敦煌的規模，然而刻得整齊而精細，千個同樣的浮雕佛像，却同樣說明了佛敎文化的深度澎湃的思潮。此外還有幾個斷腿折足的六朝石佛。此外也還有十幾個襤褸如乞丐的中華民國陸軍步兵，他們有幾個也像六朝石佛一樣，坐在獨門前面的壁根下，看一片大操塲上的紅纓槍在一二三四，有的則在魏碑旁邊堆些枯枝黃葉，燃火取暖，烟薰得刺人眼鼻和嚨喉。我鑽進這己成烟洞的小屋，含着眼淚看完那些筆緻怪誕的碑和石佛，這羣活的石佛站起來向我說：</p>
<p>「我們咱辦呢？官長。」我也不知道咱辦，同他們一談，這才衆　齊發，嘮叨不休。說是他們原是廿二軍，駐偷林的，因爲「八路軍打我們」，被俘虜了。「八路軍來得好多啊！我們咱不打敗呢？」我說西安不是飛隊伍來救了嗎？「那是我們胶了以後才來救的啊！」他們說：「八路就這樣對我們說：你們打啥？你們打塔了才來救。你們願幹八路的就在這裏幹，不願送你們回去。我們可不願幹，那邊一路上送過來，也憑你吃個飽，可是到了這邊，縣政府每天只發一人兩個　，咱吃得飽？還不相信我們嘆。天冷！」</p>
<p>原來如此。無怪要向我這「官長」咱辦了？他們蒙着一身嫌疑喟兩個　，不知算是救濟，還是一種懲罰。我爲他們在這小城裏問來問去，問不出一個辦法來，大勢所趨，我明白了，原來辦法是早已經決定了的，是無爲而治的聽其自然。</p>
<p>耀縣人自以爲居住在一隻船中間。西北缺乏水，自己幻想着所住的地方是一隻船，他們說得有理：你看，一條沮水，一條漆水，縣城就像浮在中間的一隻船。不知什麼年代，縣衙裏　了一口井，這船就漏了，耀縣淹在水裏，後來趕快塡實，這鑄一個鐵半鎭往這條船，不讓它在水裏盪動，讓我們平平穩穩地過日子。我果然看到一頭鐵牛。這比舊約上說的方舟更多現實的意義。他們還誇耀着唐代的書法家柳公權和隋代的進土孫思邈，這是陝北人所虔誠供奉的藥王。城北的柳家原便是柳公權的故里，於是這地名，便從唐代一直保留到現在</p>
<p>三原往北，地勢一直向上，遠遠看來是一座山，爬到山頂一看却是一個平原，又遠遠看外山，爬到上山時又見是一個平原。有一股粗擴雄險的氣魄。這就是所謂秦隴邱原的特色。這一帶地名便是什麽原什麽原。原字的廣泛應用起於秦中，長安南有樂游原，在古代中國文學上道盡旖旎風光。而這裏的原是田莊，是農作。是所謂關中平原區的邊緣地帶，涇惠渠區得天獨厚，棉花每畝可以收到一百二十斤的世界紀錄，而這裹不過二三十斤，比起來懸殊，但也够一般水準，土質薄，水利不敷，靠天收，秦中有「八十三月雨」之諺，即每年靠天在三八，十三個月下雨，收獲才有望，這諺語特別適用於耀縣以北缺乏利地帶。</p>
<p>這幾天碉綫緊張，我到時未聞搶聲，專員縣長大喊不得了。陸軍總司令顧祝同上次到西安來，對他們說得明明白白：「假使丟了縣政府守辦公室，丟了辦公室守公桌。」這是縣長的責任。城門口檢查特別嚴。</p>
<p>一個破碎的縣城，大街上也攤滿馬騾糞，讓它容易乾，因爲嚴冬就要降臨，城東約有一座山取名「五台山」，以裝點耀縣人的信仰。更裝飾得美麗的是藥王廟，金壁輝煌，一條大車道直通縣城，終年香火不絕，廟裏的道士吃得好。縣城裏的中學生都跪在泥像面前叩頭，手搖　筒，替他家裏的什麼人求取藥方。孫思邈無疑是唐代好醫生，據嶺靖刻碑記，說唐太宗嘗訪孫，請其出仕，而孫仍結壚於此。讚之謂「不爲三公，必爲明醫。」封眞人。孫著有「千金實要，」宋徽猷閣直學士郭思，會刻石於華州，以廣流傳，後又在道廟中再刻一套。現在這些石碑完整如昔，因爲塌拓不多，字跡淸晰，都是些單方。其中「海上方」碑則刻孫著枕上記和養生銘，多合科學原則，而通篇要義則是靜的養生，表露了儒家與道家思想合流的痕跡，文化的落後，表現了神鬼勢力的强盛，耀縣人提酒上山，去供奉這樣的廟神像發光，神話流傳，而生活窮困，如果有人去閉鎖它，無疑會被嚴重反對。有些人的見解，以爲沈入迷信總比覺醒好；况且他們獲得新的得救不知在何年何日。</p>
<h3>台原麥色　公私荒地任人墾</h3>
<p>咸同支綫到耀縣是終點，耀縣到同官以南五里堡的煤礦有拉煤車，也售客票，自五里堡到同官金鎖關，則須套車式乘馬。</p>
<p>在這一帶的邱原上，縱馬馳騁，勒繮看無限天地，西北地位的提高，自江海充份發展內陸，使它在閉塞與落後這些名稱中解放出來。</p>
<p>自耀縣到金鎖關的北行道上，麥色靑靑，然而荒地還是那麼多。政府鼓勵開荒，但鬧過一陣後，只剩下標語：「公私荒地，任人開墾。」並無大効力。因爲開墾須資本與勞力，而推動一個新運動還須組織。歷年來各縣政府所忙的主題是辦軍差，一直維持着老的生產方式，同官一縣就築了兩百座碉堡，而全縣人口不過五萬六千。耀縣全縣不過五萬人，三原不到十萬，宜君不到四萬，都同樣有着嚇人的負祖。</p>
<p>一條公路大體上順着漆水北去，兩邊是山，黃土剝蝕盡了的地方，露出二疊紀石灰岩層，還有沙礫岩和頁岩，而我所見到的麥地就在漆水兩岸。馬和騾在田裏跑，不以爲奇，啃麥來吃，也不以爲奇，而江南人看來就不免以爲奇。這時農家不希望天雨或轉暖，否則麥子長高，便難望明年的好收獲，因爲地土鬆，怕畏不結實，甚至須要壓一决，於是這些麥子便像一堆堆野齊菜似的，平平扁扁的攤在地裏。這時不忌驟馬的踐踏和啃吃，只要它長得牢就好。這裹農諺說：「正月猪，二月貓，三月裏婆娘滿地跑。」正月莊稼未發，還任憑猪亂跑，二月貓號春不落家，三月農婦到處檢地菜。整個北方的小麥帶都如此。</p>
<p>一路上盡是趕騾子的莊稼漢，有自金鎖關一帶運煤至耀縣去的，有裝包谷到城裏去賣的，而絕然不見旅行惟一利器的騾車，可見沒有行旅。古道西風，而我所騎的馬借自軍中，却並不瘦，同這些莊稼漢同行，頗有人瘦戰馬肥之感。他們驅趕騾羣，大聲吆喊，或者親應到地駡着，鞭子劈拍作響，使古道减少一點寂寞。他們的吆喊聲只有一個簡短的口令，大多是有一個音，偶或用捲舌音。他們說趕騾子有一百多個口令，文字或注音符號都不能紀錄的，左右疾徐，都能用口令指揮，但我學了他們的口令却指揮不動，他們說：「驪子可認得聲音啊」。驟子都　得很肥，他們說：「四魚　到，強如餌料啊。」這確語說只要拌草勻了，牲口自會吃盡，不消特別餌料的。</p>
<p>他午依賴着可憐的農業，神祇宗所積累下來的晨事知識生活。往往有許多動人的農　在中國農村中埋藏着，這裏也不例外。他們歌詠着野草，說：「正月茵陳二月　，三月割來當柴燒」。把正月的嫩草說成茵陳一樣的芬芳，並且推頌茵陳（藥屬，可浸酒），二月草綠，三月以後的草茂盛，準備作燃料了，這時則正是地凍草黃的季候。說着說着，我竟記下了一大堆諺語。覺得緯度的不同，水利和地質氣候的不同，他們望雨望早，或者預測天候，和江南有着顯著的不同了</p>
<p>對於動物和植物，都有他們自己的稱呼，雄的猪和狗稱牙猪牙狗，雌的則稱草猪草狗。對於貓則稱郎貓和女貓了。可是雄馬呌兒馬，雌馬呌騾馬。而雄騾則稱呌騾，雌的稱草騾。中歲的的猪又有特別稱呼，他們呌「喀郎子」。蟋蟀呌醋蜘蛛，螞蟻呌屁浮馬。這些都是土語，把遠志稱為野扁豆，柴胡稱爲雞舌頭。他們痛惡杜鵑，呌它「殺人强盜」，因爲呌聲難聽，一無好感，並不知道士丈夫和詩人給予這鳥的雅稱。</p>
<p>麥地裏的野鴿和野雞一大羣一大羣地集合着，飛翔遲緩，數目又多。如有獵槍定可收獲。</p>
<h3>同官煤礦</h3>
<p>去年雙十節，同官縣改名爲銅川縣。陝西人說起同官的時候，特稱北同官，因為讀音和潼關相同，電報局的拉丁字母拼音遇到了難題，常把兩縣的電報發錯。但同官煤礦仍是同官煤礦。</p>
<p>西安的煤荒鬧得很嚴重，可是在耀縣銅川却積着幾萬噸的煤，四五萬元一噸的混煤，西安的價格要高三借。成同支錢上的職工，有丟掉了搖紅綠旗工作去販煤的，利市三倍。問隴海路爲什麽不能把煤運到西安去，搶救一個冬天的煤荒。回答說是車輛不够。目前同官礦平均一天可產六百五六十噸，隴海路的需要量是六百噸，那一點尾數就拉出。可是同官煤礦的投資，隴海路三分之二，省政府三分之一，依照股本計算，省政府說應該給他們二百噸。煤商本領大，無論如何可以設法運一點出來，因爲利息尙隴海路變相賣車皮，而一路上騐車匠轉轍夫以至職員，都有勒索現象，車站上每個人負都有很大的櫂力，一個轉轍夫說不扳道就開不出車。販運也困難重重。西安煤價更得這樣荒唐的高是隴每路的過失。因此咸楡公道上有長途跋涉的騾羣和手推小車運煤。同官縣二十十幾家私營小礦。這些走販選大塊的才要，因為便於裝運，小塊或碎煤堆在礦裏，無人去問。隴海路有一個隴海企業公司，日本侵略東北的滿鐵，以鐵路爲中心，發展企業，大做生意，陜西人說隴海路有啥企業。把路辦好就是了。聽說最近才向當局去登記。</p>
<p>我到五里鋪同官官煤礦時新舊廠長正同盟交替竣事，礦長係省府和路局所組的理事會所決定，新礦長馬靑苑是老同盟會員，從陝西靖國軍時代起，到中央的統治力量伸入陝西，他的軍隊進入西安而就任第一任警備司令，一直到反對楊虎城，都採取堅態度。勝利前是軍委會參議？今年退休，領得退休金，「沒有這筆退休金，連路也走不成。」這五十四歲的老軍人持着堅定的態度對我說：」同官煤礦在抗戰中有了貢獻，而且是西北惟一的一個大煤礦，我們必須要把眼光放遠，站在開發西北的立塲上來經營這個礦。」一說到煤質，則不能比河南觀音堂，焦作更比不上，含硫百分之五，半烟煤。他說：「如果將來交通暢達之後，別的礦產量供應一靈活，這個礦就會有問題。」然而他相信站在開發西北的立場上，決不嫌多開一個礦，「而且可以設法減輕成本，使售價低廉。」</p>
<p>這礦上工人六千多，待映每工不過一千六百元左右，工程師的月薪也不過二十萬元右。待遇低，應該立刻提高。隴海路取去六百噸煤，只按成本加百分二十的利潤，然而隴海路拖着款子不給自己不能賣煤，隴海路的虧賬由煤礦來賠貼了。於是慨嘆着對我說：「我不過才來八天，內部情形還不很明瞭，我終覺得這個問題很嚴重。人事問題很多。現在第一件事是調整待遇，官營企業的缺點就是事務人員多，有時待遇比工程人員還高，這裏也是這種不合理現象。我已經對大家說過了，我決不是到礦上來賺錢的，如果我取非份之財，請職工檢舉我。」</p>
<p>目前來說，四個廠，十二個井，幾個是廢井，三個井包給商人，開工約有七個。動力是幾個廢車頭，材料機器是戰時凑合的，如果增加設備，事實上辦不到，辦到了自然增加產量，運輸問題不得解決，仍然說不到發展。工人都住在窰洞裏，窰洞漫暖，十二月裏也有蚊子。礦上的醫院有紀錄，去年診了七千八百次瘧疾之類的傳染，這就是說，平均每個人都看過一次病。其次是眼病，再其次是呼吸器管病。都有數千次的診治。</p>
<p>礦區的面積有二千六百餘公頃，估計儲量五千萬噸。整個同官煤藏係屬石炭二疊配含煤系，橫貫東西的大背斜石灰岩，，把它劃為南北兩區。經過探礦，土法採煤的煤井，有穿透了含煤系而盤至石灰岩的，用柱狀剖面圖來觀察，北部煤倉，向西北頃斜，東高西下，南仰北低，平均的厚度可達四公尺，總面積四千四百七十萬平方公尺，比重以一點三計，三數相乘，則得總儲量二八四四四萬公噸，可採者或僅半數，則日產四千公噸，亦可開掘百年，然而目前，包括二十多個私營小礦在內，每天不過一千二百市噸。</p>
<p>我跑到六十幾公尺深的一號井去，沒有沼氣，可以點油燈，這井用房柱法開採，礦槽發展有七八百市畝的面校，在石灰岩的天然孔隙中排水。同官岩層軟頁多，硬頁少，只能採用房柱法。礦工們頭裏厚布，汕燈綱紥在額前，烟焰飛舞，手推小車，或拖着煤筐，像蚯蚓一樣蠕動着。這也是生活。他們工作八小時或十二小時，輪　替換，科營土法開採礦，工人十日牛月換班，換班期內，寢食都在井底，不見天日，是實實在在的地下工作者。</p>

<h3>雄關地利　南望長安一覽收</h3>
<p>關中盆地自潼關迄　鷄，所謂涇渭平原，其形勢宛如京滬之間，然其寬度不過數十里，面積不過四萬方里。（我於「關中霜雪滿田園」一稿中，述及陝省水利局的灌溉工程，而此外尙有陝省農業改進所協助地方建設的幾個渠：武功偉惠渠，灌地二千畝：雲陽引洪渠，灈地二萬畝，此渠係築壩阻導山洪溉田，山洪冲刷而下，中含燐肥獨多；渭南湭惠渠，灌地二萬畝，係撥用英援華會款所築，今冬可完工；富平富惠渠，灌地二萬畝，明春可放水。陝西灌溉工程，大抵盡此。）由三原至耀縣數十里外，已到了平原的邊綠，我爬上一山，即見是一片平原，這實是黃土台地，到同官則進入山地，至宜君而更高，成爲分隔陝北與關中的脊背。宜君夏日須穿夾衣，漢武帝曾建玉華宮，以爲避著所。宜君北去黃陵洛川，地勢又低；金鎖關在宜君同官之間，雄峙山中，儼然天塹，成爲古來要險，並非偶然。</p>
<p>關中平原西高東下，西北倚六盤山，北隔子午嶺；同宜以北的陝北地區，實亦爲一盆地，倚子午嶺，西高東下，一片黃土及紅色土，爲良好宜麥帶。陝北閉塞，民貧而地並不瘠，實與一般想像大爲相殊。秦漢以還，棄於西羗，歷代西睡有事，常以爲兵戈衝要。左宗棠平回，屬部劉松山由西安北討綏德，民國以後，則又有所謂「套匪」之亂。李自成起自陝北，更無論矣。於是水利不修，文敎不振，廟堂以爲邊塞，士宦以爲畏途。關中陝北，咫尺千里。雖有沃野，不知開發，西北大部如此，豈獨陝北一隅？觀涇惠渠區一帶，水利整修以後的情景，再躍馬於金鎖關前，童山濯濯，剝蝕劇烈，溝谷縱橫，邱原可爲良田，於今盡屬廢壤。朝野高談政論，干戈擾攘未已，碉堡綫上，鴉片充斥，行愈北，問其價則愈賤。民生凋蔽，可以想見。</p>
<p>記者所經地區，地形極為複雜，細部測量，最感棘手。子午嶺紆行至宜君同官，初看都是黃土層，但同官東南地區則有大部份的露天紅色土，恐即爲著名的三門系紅色土。黃土層原是蓋在紅色土上的，最厚可達數十公尺，可見沖刷剝蝕的劇烈。合原所以遠看如山岡，實由於剝蝕割裂的緣故，往往兩個平原之間，隔着一道深谷，彼此不能通行，須繞很多的路，而谷底，復成車道或麥田。數小時的大雨，可以產生一條溝，黃土千仞，雖若不墜，但剝蝕的容易程度，却是極可估計的。</p>
<p>同官縣城在間，居民不過二千數百人，出北閩行三十里而至金鎖關，西去關錢亦僅十餘里至二十除里，記者本擬北行黃陵，然此際道途多阻，時生變故，十日行程，經歷七縣，已可略窺風土，乃折返西安。金鎖關建置於宋，淸代汛防，僅有守備一員，其後改駐把總一員，守兵二十名，每年每兵不過支銀八月，月支一兩，年給米五石，由縣供給，現縣人尙能道之，可見今昔負擔之殊。現記者躍馬關前，惟見一帶關牆，迤山而下，兩山合聚，石岩壁之，陡成險道，拓舊日關口爲北行公路，昔日的「雄關」作用已完全消失，登關四望，蒼茫八荒，縱目南望，居高臨下，一覽無遺。邊關遺址，還有從前營房和懇地，半叢衰柳，彷彿如一個蒼髯老卒，荷鋤耕於山麓，望着南山的夕陽。</p>

<p>第二次大戰期中治療藥物有顯着進展。這顯著的進展實使人類健康和生命得到更深一層的保障，依進展的程序而論可以說第一是礦　製劑之綜合與演化；第二是血漿之保存及無限制的使用；第三是盤尼西林的發明及大量出產，國內人士對第一及第三者的治療價値顯然已有相當的了解，而對於第二者的用途及用法似仍是一知半解，甚至因用之不得其法反而因啼廢食。作者在抗戰前期曾在加美兩國隨專家硏究輸血療法，歸國後又在昆明主持血庫多年。爰就研究及經騐所得，作一簡略的介紹。</p>

<p>（A）營養必需物——凡已經腸胄消化之營養物質必須經血漿之吸收和轉運，始可達到人體各部之組織，又組織內剩餘或儲蓄之營養物質亦須經過血漿之吸收和轉運始可進入營養貧乏之組織。由是觀之，血漿不啻爲營養物質之總踏，凡人體所需之營養物質如蛋白質，氨基酸，脂肪，脂酸，葡萄糖，維他命及無基鹽等無不應有盡有。</p>
<p>（B）維持滲透壓之物質——健康人體之循環血量恒有一定，的爲體質百分之九。其所以能保持一定者，多賴血漿內之滲透壓，該種滲透壓能阻止血管內液體之滲出，其已滲出者仍可使其回至血管以內。血內維持滲透壓之物質有二即蛋白質及鹽類是也。</p>
<p>C內分泌素——內分泌素爲經常調整人體各部變遷之機稱。例如甲狀腺及生長素之控制發育，胰島素之控制碳水化物新陳代謝及卵巢素之控制生育等是也，此種內分泌素發源於內分泌腺，隨由血液送至各種器官，是以血漿內亦有內分泌素之存在。</p>
<p>（D）各種酵素——人體內之新陳代謝及抗毒作用多以酵素爲媒介，血漿內所含酵素不一而足，其最著者爲凝血酵素。</p>
<p>（E）各種抗體——人體如受細菌之侵襲即生抗體，在血漿內循環以與細菌相抗，血內抗體之種類及多寡人各不同，在多數混合之血漿內，抗體種類及含量，大抵較多。</p>
<p>（F）其他來歷不明之生活素。</p>
<p>（二　)用途及用法_知血漿之有效成分，即可推知其用途。關於血漿之用途及用法可以分述於左</p>
<p>（A）創傷性及手術性休克</p>
<p>關於休克（Shock）之病源，至今尙無定論，但其顯著之病理變化，爲血漿逃出血管以外則己爲大衆所公認。由於某種惡性因素之作用，以致皿管擴張滲透力加大，血漿逃至周圍組織之內。因此循環血量大爲减少，組織內氧氣及其他營養之供給均感不足，如不立即救治，在九至十二小時之內，患者大抵死亡救治休克之有效方法，在於迅速灌注血漿。美國休克專家施歌德氏之言曰：「當輸血而不輸血則死可立待，輸血不足則徒勞無功。」血比重，分血計及血壓三者爲決定輸血時間及數量之標準。如血比重及分血計高於正常而血壓降至百分之七十以下，是爲血液過濃心臟排血量大减之明證，應即灌注大量血漿，直至三者復原爲止。我國休克患者之表情往往不如白種人之顯著，雖已臨生死關頭其狀鎭靜如故，故化騐診斷甚爲重要。如患者尙能進食，且無乾涸症象，則可由靜脈濯注濃縮血漿或濃縮血淸蛋白藉以增加血管內之滲　透壓，俾已滲透至週圍組織內之血漿回至血管以內，爲預防手術休克之產生，最好在施行大手術之前後灌輸三百至五百公分之血漿。此種處置在美國各大醫院之手術室中已成不可缺少之常規。</p>
<p>（B）流血性休克</p>
<p>內外損傷流血固可以引起休克，但大量之咯血，腸胃流血，子宮外孕流血及血崩等亦何嘗不可引起嚴重之休克。此種休克與上述休克之異點爲血比重，分血計及血壓三者同時下降。在此種情况之下，應迅速由多數靜脈同時灌注血漿使息者渡過危險時期，然後繼以全血或紅血球之濯注。蓋循環血量如損失在三分之一以上，則可致性命危險，而紅血球之損失如不超過百分之六十則仍可維持其最低限度之換氣作用也。</p>
<p>（C）灼傷或燙傷</p>
<p>最重之灼傷或燙傷均可引起休克，故除局部治療外應灌注血漿，冀以制止休克。即在休克過去以後，患部仍有血漿繼續滲出，據施歌德氏之估計，人體三級灼傷如達全身面積三分之一，則廿四小時內患處血漿損失的在四百公分以上，爲維持患者正常血量，血漿之灌注殊爲必要。如患者尙能自進飲料，則宜用濃縮血漿。</p>
<p>（D）繼發性貧血</p>
<p>此種貧血之療法，在消滅其症源，並促進紅血球之產生。欲促進紅血球之產生，務須儘量供給製造紅血球之原料，此則包括蛋白質及鐵質等物，血漿內含充份之蛋白質及其他之滋養物質，可以供給一部份紅血球製造之原料，故可爲鐵劑治療之輔助物。</p>
<p>（E）營養不良</p>
<p>嚴甫營養不良，血液中蛋白白每低於正常。結果血中水份繼續滲透至週園組織，形成週身水　，對於該種病病惟有根據血中蛋白之測騐，連續注射濃縮血漿，方可使病者迅速復原。</p>
<p>（F）蛋白缺乏症</p>
<p>由於腎小管脂肪性變化所引起之血蛋白缺乏症，此種患者之血蛋白常繼續自腎臟中排出。因此血內蛋白顯著减低，亦可形成週身水腫，此種病人亦宜用血漿治療，如每日排泄之蛋白質在廿五公分以上，而患者不能多進蛋白質，則每日應輸入血漿四百公分，蓋血漿中之蛋白普通在百分之七左右也。</p>
<p>（G）熱病</p>
<p>如腸熱症，斑疹傷寒，及結核病患者腸胃消化及吸收旣不正常，而體質之消耗又大，結果乃有負的氮平衡（Negative　NitrogenBalance）此種病理變化不使降低患者之抵抗力並且可引起不良之複雜症。若於多進飲料之外再連續注射血漿，則可增進患者之營養及抵抗力。</p>
<p>（H）腸胃病</p>
<p>此種患者無論已否施用手術治療，如不能多進營養料則必至每况愈下。補救之法在連續注射血漿以增進營養及患部之痊愈。靜止不動之成人每日至少需要蛋白質五十公分，即需要七百公分之血漿，健康血漿每百公分的含蛋白質七公分。</p>
<p>（I）急性傳染病</p>
<p>混合人體血漿旣有各種抗體，故對於痳疹，百日咳，水痘，猩紅熱，丹毒及臟腺炎等均有預美國兒科專家鮑氏Bavenberg之實驗證明已作痳疹預防注射之四七三三兒童中（每人自肌肉內注射血漿廿至四十公分），僅發現六個初發性痳疹，而未作痳疹預防注射之一一二八〇兒意中，即有九十四人患初發性痲疹。</p>
<p>（J）不足月之嬰犯</p>
<p>現代醫學進步，對於懷胎不滿六月而出生之嬰兒亦可保持生命，除調節溫箱溫度供給氧氣及特別營養外，並可連續注射小量血漿。</p>
<p>（K）腦內壓增加及乳房內結塊</p>
<p>對於此種患老如能迎續注射濃縮血漿或濃縮之血淸蛋白並同時减少飲料，則所獲效果遠較施用硫酸鎂劑瀉劑之治療爲佳。</p>
<p>血漿之用途雖多，但亦有禁忌症，如醫臟機能障碍，血壓過多，充血性心衰弱或急性肺水腫，則灌注血漿務宜愼重，大量尤爲不宜。</p>
<p>（三）血漿優劣鑑別方法——抗戰勝利以後，美國軍用剩餘之乾血漿亦隨其他之剩餘物資流入我國市塲。孰優孰劣，近代藥典尙無鑑定方法。但各種出品良莠不齋，在所不免。爲便於識別起見，特略述乾血漿鑑別法，以供用者之參考：</p>
<p>（A）顏色——失效之乾血漿，爲輕鬆無定形粉末，恒呈草黃色，其凝結不散或帶淡綠色者不可用。</p>
<p>（B）未失效之乾血漿在加入蒸溜水後一分鐘內應全部溶解。</p>
<p>（C）溶液混濁度——混濁爲液體血漿常有之物理性質，但在電光比色器下，其混濁度不應超過七百度。</p>
<p>（D）殘餘水份（Resicual　Moisture）——乾血漿內之殘餘水份不宜超過％1.0.</p>
<p>（E）無致熱質——所謂致熱質者，即細菌屍體或細菌之排世物。如配製血漿之器具不經特製藥品之洗滌，或溶化乾血漿之汽水未經特製濾過器之消毒，則發熱作用無法避免。</p>
<h3>蛋白質水解產物　其生理作用及治療效能</h3>
<p>— 許肇堆講　陶壽淇記</p>
<p>蛋白質榮養之深刻研究，四十餘年前即已開始。當時著名學者對於食物之蛋白質含量，蛋白質與氮之變換數，身體之氮量平衡，以及蛋白質之生物價値等，不無供獻。以後之硏究，關於氨基酸之分析，主要氨基酸之檢定，蛋白質與水腫之關係等等，亦曾逐一闡明。然而，以往之工作，大致散漫而無系統統其中Chittende氏之硏討，認謂人體對於蛋白質之需要及耐受量相當低微，結果不無兇險之影響，因爲一般人士之印象，皆以爲人體所需之蛋白質極易應付。當時，維生素之硏究日見發展，不久即顯示其重要性。因此，近日之一般臨床醫生，但知注重維生素而往往不顧及蛋白質之重要。直至最近，由於新穎簡快之蛋白質檢定方法之應用，以及蛋白質水解產產物之大量生產與治療上之發展，故而蛋白質榮養一題，遂重復引起醫學界之興趣及注意焉。</p>
<p>蛋白質之主要功能茲將蛋白質對於人體之主要功能略述如次；</p>
<p>（一）保持皿量——蛋白質之緊急功用血漿內之蛋白質乃一膠性體，故能產生一有效之滲透壓，以抵抗毛細管血壓，使血管內之液體不致過份溢出，而血量藉以保持。任何創傷之處，除出血外常有血漿蛋白質之滲出，使血液之滲透壓降低而因此加重血量之減少。</p>
<p>（二）保持組織之完整褥瘡之硏究結果，已顯示蛋白質對於組織完整之重要。患褥瘡之病人，血內蛋白質過低而氮平衡呈負性。如能增加其蛋白質之攝入，使氮平衡轉爲正性，則褥瘡亦隨之痊癒，蓋缺乏蛋白質榮養之組織，活力減低而易於崩潰也。</p>
<p>（三）促進傷口之癒合蛋白質缺乏，影響纖維組織之生長，使任何傷口碍難收縮。手術後之傷口，遇血漿內蛋白質過低時，常有崩裂之趨向，倘能使蛋白質之入量增加，傷口即霍然癒合。</p>
<p>（四）助長免疫體，內分泌及酵素之產生此項功能之存在，僅屬假說，尙待明確之證實後，方能成立。</p>
<p>（五）恢復期之功用疾病恢復時期之蛋白質新陳代謝，由於下列因素之作用，常起顯著之變化：甲患病時發生食慾不振，惡心，或嘔吐者，可减少蛋白質之入量。乙醫院中之飲食，因經濟上或其他困難，所含之蛋白質分量時常過低。丙胃腸道失常之病人，則蛋白質之吸收不良。丁滲出作用之影饗——身體喪失任何液體，必同時喪失蛋白質，尤以受灼傷之表面或大膿腔內所滲出之液體，所含之蜜白質量特高。故而患廣大面積之灼傷或膿胸等之病人，每日所損失之蛋白質量，常不下五十至六十克。戊在疾病或創傷時期由小便中排出之蛋白質量，往往較正常時超出數倍。由上述五點，可見疾病或創傷時期之人體，常受大量蛋白質之剝奪。因此，恢復時期有補充蛋白質之必要。</p>
<p>高度滋義療法　通常天然飲食中每日所含之氮量約十克，高蛋白質飲食中則爲二十克。所以，如果在病熊情况下，蛋白質之需要增加至相當程度時，則決非天然飲食所能應付，而必須給與氨基酸（Amion-acids）或蛋白質水解產物（Protein　hycrolysates）。蛋白質入量之需要超過天然食物所能供給之分量時，即稱之謂高度滋養（byperalimentation）.</p>
<p>蛋白質水解產物之應用　純粹之氨基酸混合劑，（譯者按：氨基酸乃蛋白質消化或分解時所變成之最後產物，即以此由胃腸道吸收，其與蛋白質之關係猶如葡萄糖之與炭水化合物也。）製造困難而價格高昂，故而不如蛋白質水解產物之適用。蛋白質水解產物可自牛乳·肉·魚·大豆·釀母·或其他含有蛋白質之食品製造。蛋白質水解產物之施用，有以下數優點：（一）不需要消化。（二）容量小。（三）可作藥物服用，不受胃口之影響。（四）與醫院當局意欲節省病人飲食方面之開支者，可免衝突。其主要缺點爲：（一）味不佳。（二）大量服用時可引起腹瀉。</p>
<p>蛋白質水解產物治療上之用途</p>
<p>（一）消化性潰瘍　消化性潰瘍之高度滋養療法，已由薛邦祺醫師於前期本列加以討論，故本篇中毋須　述。</p>
<p>（二）榮養不良　榮養不良之病人，治以高度滋養療法，可於四五日內使浮腫消退，而血液內蛋白質及紅血球量復原。</p>
<p>（三）肺結核症　高度滋養療法與其他治療肺結核症之方法並用，可加速病况之進步。</p>
<p>（四）手術後之療理　施行外科手術，尤以胃腸道之手術後，施用高度滋養療法，可以促進病人之榮養而縮短其恢復時期。。</p>

<p>此新藥現已陸續述來上海（紐約時報）</p>
<p>醫壇新話</p>
<h3>最新的維生素</h3>
<p>— 紹</p>
<p>葉酸（Folic　Acid）的發現，雖然已有多年，但是到最鈑才闡明其化學構造，而其人工合成才吿成功。</p>
<p>從化學上言之，葉酸是由下列三個不同之化學荃團組成：翅素（Pterin），對氨安息香酸（p-Aminobenroic　acid），及鈇氨基酸（Glutamic　acid）。翅素是蝴蝶翅膀的一種黃色素；葉酸亦係黃色的結晶。</p>
<p>葉酸原係乙種維生素複合體（Vitamin　B　Complex）中的一種成分，初稱酪乳菌因素，因酪乳菌繁育時必需此營養因素故也。最近報吿，葉酸亦係人類造血機能所需之要素，對於種種巨細胞性貧血具有特效，與肝製劑無異。按肝製劑提純困難’而其檢定又非用惡性貧血之臨床病例不可，故價格高昂，應用不便。葉酸爲人工合成品，母需生物檢定，將來大量生產，價格必低，其完全取代肝製劑之日當在不遠。</p>
<p>遠在一九三五年，戴氏（Day）等早己報吿，天然葉酸（當初稱M種維生素）有防治白鼠之一種營養性貧血之效。但此人工合成品，對於人類巨細胞性貧血之療效，至一九四五年，始由美國維生素專家施筆士氏（Spies）等發現。氏等試於美國南部所常見之營養性巨細胞性貧血數例，獲得與肝製劑同樣之療效。即血中綱織血球數迅速增加，隨以紅血球數與血紅素量之堅定上昇。本年又試用於斯　盧症（Spjes），妊娠期巨細胞性貧血及眞性惡性貧血等，均得同樣之成功。此種結果業經同國之Darby氏Moore氏等，及Zuclzer　＆Cgden等加以充分證實。最近英國Wilkinson等採用葉酸於惡性貧血五例，亦獲得同樣之滿意成績。</p>
<p>雖然，葉酸並非即係肝製劑中之有效成分（補血素）蓋葉酸係鮮明橙黃色結晶，而最精製之肚　骨則係無色。Willmson氏認爲，葉酸或能在體內刺激肝臟血素之生成。但據去年英國Jacobson　＆William兩氏在十月份病理學細菌學雜認中所發表之實騐報吿，則肝于臟補血素與葉酸恐係同屬之化合物，而其主要化學基團即係翅素。據此二學者之研究，合成之黃翅素（Xamthopterin），與白翅素（Leucopterin），與肝浸膏三者，均能對於摘除脾臟之家兎，產生同樣之網織血球反應，而其他物質如鐵及多種維生素（惜未試葉酸）則無此作用，故氏等認爲肝臟補血素或係一種翅素衍化物。</p>
<h3>世界衛生機構　（下）</h3>
<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>一曰關於健康之新界說——該組織法案之序文中，首揭最進步而廣義的健康界說，認爲健康是身體的，心理的，和社交的完全健全狀態，不僅免於疾病而巳。又認爲最高水準的健康，是每一個人類——不論其種族宗敎及政治信仰，經濟及社會地位如何——的基本權利。又認爲政府對於人民健康的保障，負有不可逃避的實任。讀者試思：我國人民對於健康涵意的看法如何？有多少人享受到這種基本權利？政府已盡到保障人民健康的責任吾？</p>
<p>二曰關於衛生之功能——他們都認爲科學的衛生學術，在此動盪的世界中，大有助於人類的和平相處。深信衛生設施，將提高人民的生活水準，促進社會的經濟繁榮。而協助完成吾人之共同目標——世界和平。他們都認爲祇有健康而營養無匱的人民，才能眞正了解基本自由的眞諦。又認爲公共衛生，是許多科學原理的活動的綜合的結晶體。許冬先進國家，由於衛生設施，人民的平均壽命巳較上一世紀延長了一倍。但是各國的發展情形，殊不平衡有些國家生出來的兒童，難得有半數能活到五歲，他們人民的平均壽命，祇及較運的國家人民的一半歲數，他們又認爲欲達到世界衛生機構的偉大目的，需要我們衛生聲學人員的最大的努力，持久的努力；但是僅僅靠我們的努力還不會够，我們必需動員所有人類，讓他們都能了解衛生的道理而共同奮鬥。讀者試思：我們的人民，有多少人够了解基本自由的眞諦？我們人民的平均壽命是多少？祇有天知道，也許祇及美英的一半，我們的衛生醫學人員，努力到什麼程度？人民又動員到什麽程度？</p>
<p>三曰關於不衛生的影響——他們都認爲：在衛生的領域中，國家是相互倚賴的，是息息相通的。任何地區的瘟疫，可以危害到別的國家。低的人民他康水準，不但妨醫其本國的經濟繁榮，且將影響到全世界的整個繁榮。讀者試思：我們年年常見的天花，霍亂，傷寒，痢疾，回　熱，　疾，黑熱病，鼠疫，鈎虫病，住血蟲病，結核病等等的流行，對於本國和世界的影響何如？</p>
<p>四曰關於世界衛生機構的今後使命——今後，所有過去成立的國際衛生組織，均將歸併到這個新的世界衛生機構裏來。牠將運用一切最近代化的科學知識和設備，來戰勝病魔瘟神，所以防疫自仍爲第一義。但此僅爲第一個步驟，須知世界上有幾多人民在飢餓綫下掙扎！所以運用我們的營養學識，來配合農業糧食一產方面的努力，以達到免於飢餓之自由，亦爲目標之一。第二個步驟，是要正面的積衡的推進生理的和心理的健康，以期達到更高水準的生理發育，更長的壽命，更有效方的生產方量，和更有意義的生命。</p>
<p>但是人類如果不能和平相處，再來一次大的戰爭。則一切將同歸於盡，衛生也是徒然。吾人應知科學可以爲善，亦可以爲惡，其關鍵不在科學家本身，而在廣大人羣的覺悟和良知，來決定人類命運的吉兇生死。就爭取世界和平的立塲而論，世界衛生機構，似不失爲團結全世界人民的一個聚點，各種文化不同信仰不同的人們的一個交誼應，也許可能成爲世界和平機構的一個熱石。不勝聚香祝之！</p>
<h3>愛克斯光診斷下的　消化性潰瘍</h3>
<p>— 陳又新</p>
<p>愛克司光的胃部檢騐與肺部檢騐有兩點顯著的差別，第一點是組織方面的不同，肺能不靠一種另外的媒介而自然地在愛克司光下顯示出牠的輪廓來；對於胃這種自然的顯露是不可能的，所以通常需要一種特殊的藥品充實牠的內部才能被人家檢查出來，這種藥品若不是純粹的硫酸鋇即是硫酸鋇和着別的不重要的成份而合成的，單吃這種藥有一些石灰水樣子的外相，和一些泥土一樣的味兒，這種藥是很好的，在胃腸中不起什麼化學作用，不妨礙胃腸的工作，引不起什麽副作）用，又不毒，却能帮助檢查，第二點差別是胃的功作是間歇的而肺的工作是述續的，這樣胃的檢查需有一個起點一個終點，起點暈空肚的時候開始檢查，終點是胃中不再有鋇的餘漬的時候，在這兩者之間檢查可以依據實情而調節的。由此看來，胃部檢騐此肺部檢騐比較的繁複。</p>
<p>檢驗胃部的方法是透視與攝片並重的，依診斷的本身價値而論，透視比攝片益加重要，在透視的時候胃的位置可以自由變更，任何的部份可以摩撫，任何可疑的地方可以詳細的觀察，壓痛的地方可以測知，胃壁的柔軟或僵硬，粘着或獨聳，或者胃功用的亢進或者衰退，蠕動的自在或者斷續，還有幽門部或者任何部的肌肉縮緊或者鬆弛都可以得到一個正確的槪念，常然病原本身的印影也同時可以在透視板遇露出來，但是攝片也有特殊的效能，這不單是一種影子的紀錄可供後日的參考或者會診方面的藍本，同時也可以供給透視時所遺漏或者顯示得不淸楚的資料。</p>
<p>如若以上的方法不能歸納得一個正確的診斷，那麽還有幾種特殊的檢查方法可資利用，現在略而勿論，還有一種情况，胃部的病象是隨和別的部份或者別的系統所患的疾病而發生的，舉一人例說，很多的所謂消化不良或者胃痛是因為盲腸的疾病而發生的，也有所謂真正的胃壁腐爛却是因腦子毛病而得來的，但即若胃部本身的疾病，愛克司光檢騐也不一定能得確定的結論，不過大多數的失敗，多半是爲了病態的輕微與得病時間的短暫所致，也有因爲許多副的徵象的存在把病的主要徵象在愛克司光檢查時埋沒了，所以在很多的塲合，愛克司光檢查的結果祗能認爲一種臨床方面的參考，像別的實騐室方法一樣，而不能認作爲一種診斷，不過如若這種結果非常明確的時候，或者檢查的人很有經騐而能自信的時候，這就等於，一個完善，獨立的診斷也無不可。</p>
<p>也有人懷疑，在胃部檢查時，所受的愛克司光的量，會對於身體有什麽害處沒有？這個回答可以依據現代的知識否定的，普通所謂引起至少限度生物變化的愛克司光量在一個周密的胃部檢查中很難超過，也即是說這種思慮在平常的情况下是多餘的。</p>
<p>現在要說到有消化性潰瘍的病者爲什麽需要愛克司光檢騐了，第一當然要查查看潰瘍有沒有存在，如過證實了，那麽牠的地位，大小，深淺與數量都需要明瞭，其次要測知牠與胃作用的關連，消化的妨礙，胃排洩的阻塞，胃壁的黏着或者其他的一切，第二要分出這潰瘍還是屬於普通的一類抑或所謂惡性的一類，第三是關於治療方法的選揀了。即若在潰瘍治療的過程中，愛克司光的覆查也有其必要。確定治療之有效與否，這種覆查是很有助的。再有，在用過外科手術之後，胃部的檢查不單在臨床方法能得有力的參照，同時也可以及時作預防潰瘍再發的處置。</p>
<p>關於潰瘍的愛克司光的病象，最有確定性價値的，莫若「壁籠」這個徵象了。「壁蘢』這個影子是有病的一個器官，在牠的輪廓上有突出來的一小塊地方。這就是潰瘍本身被吃的藥鐵進去所發生的影子。這種「壁籠』的地位，大都處於胃的上沿，或者處於直接與胃相通的十二指腸尖端，偶然處於幽門上或者食道下端。雖然胃潰瘍本身遠比十二指腸潰瘍數目來得少，但「壁蘢』本身却比較容易在胃部找尋。不過不是每個潰瘍患者都很容易的顯示這個重要的徵象，所以有時必需依賴別的徵象而能確定診斷了。這裏暫時略而不詳。</p>
<p>現在要講到有什麽時候不能舉行胃部檢查的事了。有的時候胃部檢騐是不相宜的，或者應該延遲的。譬如，胃部流血之後，檢查時的摩撫有引起再度流血的可能。也有時潰瘍快洞穿了，那麽檢查時的手術或許也能引起不良的後果。</p>

<h3>長江行</h3>
<p>— 甘笑</p>
<p>二十世紀該是「人定勝天」的時代了，然而我們日常許許多多地方，老是「困極而呼天」。</p>
<p>這次我由漢口來，由江到江，本來是一條極平穩的水路，我却好幾次呼天；而且在平安抵家之後，也還鄕下老太婆似的感覺着是「上天保佑」。</p>
<p>拿錢買船票是最簡單的事，但我還是呼了天。我到漢口的那天，江岸靠着好幾條船，貨物旅客，都已吐得一乾二凈。可是較大的是屬於國營招商局，已被派爲「差船」。較小的是民營公司的船隻，正式售票的時間僅止一口氣數得出的幾分鐘，其勢不得不走黑市。而一位在船公司服務的朋友，數出一大堆黑市票的不穩妥處，這又使得我畏法的老百姓不得不謹愼退縮。「明人不做暗事」，我順從朋友的勸吿，等待「自市」票的到手。結果等等之又等，棧房裏的老鼠和臭虱放肆夾攻，我急的頭髮發白，堅決主張獻給「黑」吃；才以一倍半的代價，買來「固統」（有舖位的統艙）的三等票，頭二等票自然是輸下到了。</p>
<p>我坐的這條船，資格可不算漢：高齡五十三了！踏上甲板來，脚底沾搭搭的，表示是飽經烟　，不是　出茅蘆的白皮嫩肉。戲重據說是五百噸左右，在漢口裝了三四百噸貨物，四五百個旅客；旅客多半是復員的軍政人員，箱籠雜物左擁右抱，船身可說是相當充實的了。頭二等客人爲數不多，大都是三等「固統」與四等「活統」。這兩等人統統要塞在這魚腸裏面，怎能叫人不呼天啊！</p>
<p>「固統」的舖位分上下二層，我的是在下層。側着身子把被包打開舖好，把幾件小行李安放脚下；爲减少擁擠起見，脫了皮鞋鑽到被窩裏去。接着吵鬧聲一陣陣傳來，大致是賽人的行李過多，茶房竭力阻擋之類。茶房有甚麼用呢？他們又沒有草綠色衣服和領章；於是「固統」成了變相的行李間，甚麼氣窗南道，都被行李阻塞不通。而最妙的是我的「頭上人」：他們大小共十一位，買的祗是四個上層鋪位；兩個舖位準備坐人；兩個舖位準鋪擺那二十五六件行李！當他們把六支上了刺刀的步槍放下，茶房就都閉了嘴站得遠遠，縮籠雜物便一件件搬來。我仰着睡看上面看得十分明白：放行李鋪位漸漸歪斜，唯一的橫擋漸漸彎曲，我知道那下面的兩個　頭睡了的女客，臨到了萬分危險，不由得站起來抗議，我說：</p>
<p>「這裏不是行李李間，大家都這樣拿行李塞進來，空氣會完全被擠出去的。而且這種薄板上放這些行李，上頭的舖位要坍下來，壓死了人誰負責任」？</p>
<p>嘿！他們的顯目挺身出來了，胸部一拍：「我負責，我是旅長」！他把他的少將階級的領章一指。哦！旅長！我心襄想：「旅長是天上掉下來的，管甚麼壓死人不壓死人」？這樣想的常中，橫擋果然斷了，若不是下面女客的鋪位上也有箱餽，她們兩個怕英要考騐考騐旅長的「負責」了。我不知怎麼一來，重重地在那旋長的肩上敲了一下，沒有說話，祗捺了電簡呌他看那根斷了的橫檔。他這會兒氣焰稍爲低點，指揮他的土兵：「行李搬下來！要出命案了」！於是他的全部的行李都塞在過遭，四個舖位光祇睡十一個人丁，我們「下層人」得免於壓死的浩劫，不得不謝天謝地！</p>
<p>第二天早晨　到了女厠所的地方：沿着船尾走到廚房，由廚房走下抉梯，穿過活統的舖位，右手拐彎便是。打開那扇短門，裏面的情形不堪萬目：顯上是便溺直淌；脚下是無處立錐。天哪十六七世紀大西洋上的「黑奴船」，怕就是這個光景罷？</p>
<p>爬上扶梯，一堆人蹲着堵住了去路，俯身一看，他們都是雙手在地板上捧飯。一　飯被倒翻了，白飯拌上了沾脚底的黑漿，倒像是猪汕芝蔴湯團心子；天哪！這是他們準備給三四等賽人　的哩！</p>
<p>想轉到甲板上透口氣，可是這條船壓根兒沒有甲板，一眼望去，全是如山的柴板！「活統」的朋友個個都學勾踐的臥薪，把柴板常了舖位。柴板之外，鷄蛋，鴨蛋，鹹魚醃肉，不知有幾十百籮。找了一個老茶房一問，才知這是船上的賬房和茶房的私貨。我問他私貨爲甚麼可以帶這許多？他皺起眉毛苦笑地說：「不帶又有甚麼辦法？我們一共卅五個茶房，沒有一個大錢的薪水，船上祗供給一口白飯，家裏各人還有孩子老婆。客人現在多半是軍人，茶費小賑撈撈不到手，不帶私貨有甚麼辦法？現在是瞞上不瞞下，除了公司的大老板之外，船上的賬房間，彼此是一氣的。賑房間有薪水，而且還可以船上賣賣舖位；但他們帶的私貨，祗有比我們更多」。我不能估計他們的私貨有多少重量，但當我伸出頭往下一看，平靜的江水已經和船舷差不多相齊，若有小小的波浪，就可以打進氣窗。這條高年的小船，牠眞是要危乎其殆。</p>
<p>先師敎人「不立於危墻之下」，我們現在被裝在危船之上，四顧江水茫茫，除了暗地呼天，還有甚麼安心的辦法？</p>
<p>過了大通，中夜忽然拋錨，大家紛紛問茶房。老茶房解說道；「有霧呀！天上落霧了。船上薪水低；領港是沒有經騐的毛脚蟹，這呌做瞎眼不嫌蹺脚，蹺脚不嫌瞎眼，就彼此將就將就了。這種時候，能小心點停下來，總算好的」。天啊，拋錨總算好的！否則我們要犧牲在他們的「瞎」與「蹺」了！</p>
<p>將近江陰，　又拋錨了，性急的船客都跳　起來，那個老茶房又來解釋了：「客人你們着急，我們的領港比你們還急，他家裏明天晚上有喜事。沒得法子呀！船快要到「拋錨沙」，天黑了，霧又重，怎麼走法？別人外國船還要當心。還說我們的「老爺船」！有幾個客人間他：「甚麼呌「拋錨沙」？「拋錨沙」？「拋錨沙」就是怪氣！就是妖孽！半晚上合將攏萊，船走到就擱淺了，天亮了沙沉下去，船也就一道吸下去。從前有條法國船，在道地方擱淺了，以爲不要緊，到天亮被妖怪吸掉了。祇有東洋人在這的時候，妖怪也怕了他們，從來不出現」。妖怪眞怕東洋人麼？想來多幾個燈塔罷了！</p>
<p>拋錨了兩個鐘頭，機輪又喘喘地發動。霧一層層加重，江岸藏得無影無踪。汽笛每隔兩分鐘長呌一聲，聲聲的長呌竟像野獸垂死的哀號，好不呌人心亂！老茶房獨白似的在發牢騷：「尋死！這樣的霧也開船！走得過領港一個人好做新郞，走不過五百人一同好見閻王！」夜深一盞半明的油燈搖搖幌幌，橫七豎八的臥客活像死屍，茶房的怨語與哀號的汽笛交響，令人毛髮悚然，彷彿閻王正在招手似的。</p>
<p>好容易天已大明太陽有破雲撥霧之勢，江岸雖然還是看不見，汽笛越來越叫得稀了。再過了幾小時，總算把我們送到了黃浦江岸。當我們踏到岸上時，更生的慶幸，如同登了天堂。</p>
<p>江上是這麼暗無天日，二十世紀江上行，各人還祗靠靑天，誰願意生在此時此地呢？</p>
<h3>「果實」原稿</h3>
<p>— 鮑蒂西利</p>
<p>鮑蒂西利（Sancro　Botticelli　I44E-1510）在佛羅朗斯畫派中可算是一個極富想象力的傑出人才，他雖然也畫過幾張聖母子圖，但，他却是一個大胆的反基督敎者。代表作有「春之頌」，「維納斯之誕生」等。搆圖特殊巧妙，色鮮綫美，取材雖屬空想，而所繪之顏面，充滿了愛慾，有一種「近代的」感覺。「果實」原稿就是一列。　（獅）</p>
<h3>冬至草</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>是夢回的時候。</p>
<p>窗外的寒風呼號着。</p>
<p>囂沸的麼　靜止了，枕邊的憶念又　　向悽惻的人生。心頭有了憂　的淸塞。</p>
<p>我彷彿聽見了妳的竊笑：</p>
<p>「你的生之跋涉巳漸趨晦暗而瑟縮了！」</p>
<p>是的，已經一年了，一正是今天，錢塘江頭的人們沉　在難有的狂歡裏的日子。和平與光明的溫囂掀開了我們的幢幜，我們慢步穿過那悠長而又寗靜的湖堤，彷彿穿過了一段已經遠離了我們身邊的苦難；柳林深處有燈火的光輝，我看見妳胸頭有着與奮而愉悅的起伏：</p>
<p>「從此，你應該鮮明而倔强的蹣跚向自已所　往的行程了！」</p>
<p>「悄悄的吧！」我的雙唇印上了妳那溫馨的髮際：「我正在想着今後那些絢爛而豪華的步子呢！」</p>
<p>小樓一角傳來曼妙的歌聲，湖水依然是靜寂的，夜霧在我們頰邊飄過；我們相對的笑了。</p>
<p>妳能說那是一個迢遙的夢寐嗎？</p>
<p>春三月，今年，我同到這都市裏。</p>
<p>我聽到了人們讚美這新生的都市的祝福聲。</p>
<p>但我看見了很多：</p>
<p>從遼遠的北國來的人，除了還殘存着一些風雪漫天中爐邊的溫暖記憶外，他們不是都學會了在那急管繁弦的帷帳邊線騙取着溫情的誓語？</p>
<p>還有那從南方踡伏到道都市裏來的人們，碧海雲天的迫慕和戀留已經淡却，許多惹人駐足的角落裏，地們不也是正在把歡樂的心音譜出了使人感到迷惘的旋律？</p>
<p>有誰懂得哀怨？有誰懂得憤怒？大家不都是在用自已的手匆促而又糊塗的製作着嘲弄我們人生的事物麼’</p>
<p>我無可奈何地一遍又一遍的跑過這都市的每一個角落，養良者的控訴被室息得快要滅絕了！到處都存在着對社會的傷害！對人性的壓榨！</p>
<p>沒有故事，沒有時篇，是一頁可悲的空白！</p>
<p>道原是一泓無底的濁流啊！</p>
<p>我漸漸地忘却了高歌和狂喊，我慢慢地壓會了人生的世故和僞裝；我接受了社會制度的贊賞與縱容，我也嘗到了人世閒的惆悵和悽愴。我變成了一粒在濁流中浮動的渣滓，渣滓是永遠不會，也不能，使濁流激湧起漣漪來的！</p>
<p>鮮明而倔强的行程已不復親切，心頭殘留着一片可恥的空虛。</p>
<p>這給與妳的失望是必然的。</p>
<p>但是，我已經够倦意的了。</p>
<p>是的，一年了，正是今天。這都市裏的人們並沒萎縮了例有的狂歡，蕭索的歌聲仍舊在揚溢，翠線的栢枝和葛蘿掩映着燭淚中的火熖，這些，都深深地喚起了我的懷念。</p>
<p>用懺悔來洗掉，我這一年中的荒怠與蹉跎吧！縱然這都市加諸於我的是殘酷，是辛酸，但還有明年，還有那麼一段可貴的歲月，……我還有一具沒有感染到庸俗和沒落氣息的靈魂！</p>
<p>我在枕邊默聯了，對着蠟炬。妳該想像到我這時候的情懷。</p>
<p>囂沸的塵寰又將恢復了吧？窗外的寒風呼號着。</p>
<p>妳應該祝福它的，這都市未來的新生！</p>
<p>是夢回的時候。</p>
<p>卅五年，冬至前夕。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血134</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「噢」！鶴見第一次感覺到起了眞的的恐怖，「那麼，這些號碼又是從那裏弄的呢」？</p>
<p>「那大槪是早一年的事」？</p>
<p>「什麼」？鶴見又以爲聽錯了。</p>
<p>「你知道我們也有一套機器，一年前常常收到這種特殊密碼可不大注意。近一年來，聽得多了，靑木老師，費了一些事，把號碼恭鍵。索隱出來，……可是你用不着躭心，到現在爲止，只有他老人家一人，可以解譯，但還要很費心思，他不願竣表，也不肯多弄，他不願耗費精神，地說他還要活下去」。</p>
<p>「啊」鶴見聽到這裹，才覺一塊石頭落地，「萍子，我還有一句話，我幹的事，這樣困難，他老人家旣說也有人在進行，這是挽救無數萬生命的善行，他老人家爲什麼……」</p>
<p>「爲什麼小把那東西找出來」？萍子替鶴見把話接了下去，「何嘗不想把東西找到，無奈找不着收藏的地點」。</p>
<p>「爲什麼不用玄術」？</p>
<p>「大哥你說你，也學過玄術，怎麼說這樣外行話」？</p>
<p>「難這不能對那收藏人行術」？</p>
<p>「沒有媒介哪」。</p>
<p>「你不是現成的媒介」？</p>
<p>「我同那老傢伙毫無感情，怎麼可以做媒介」？萍子有些生氣了。</p>
<p>「唉」！鶴見失望了，「那麼，我們再見哪」！</p>
<p>「再見，大哥，一定再見，至少有三次；末次再見，聽說很長期哩」！萍子笑格格地把電話掛上了。</p>
<p>鶴見一腔心事，沒有十分注意萍子「長期」的涵義，也不願再同她　唆下去了。晚上的進行計劃，雖說經了這電話的一番打攪，大家覺得，事情已到這步階段，已如箭在弦上，不得不發；况日萍子的話，他們都有些將信將疑咧。</p>
<p>晚上九點鐘正，鶴見已經端端正正，坐在　軍軍用機「長勝」號裏了。同行共有七八個人，除鸛見外，都是赴華北的現役上級軍官。但在飛機起飛的前半小時，東京各晚報的第二次增刋，前綫消息　導之外，都刋登着一封神秘的短簡，題名「對鶴見王挑戰神秘敵手」，文中寫着：「鶴見玉君：久慕閣下，其男兒好身手，今際遇風雲：首相亦寵以奇眼；飛黃騰達，蹺足可待。惟同人等，雖村同下駟，不干　代，有所建白，妄擬稍索代價；劍柔，雨道，任賜一二手，足矣。晚十一時左右，「別府」專誠奉候。絲野社同人拜手」。</p>
<p>當日谷晚報，都把這事，當作新鮮炎料。各報主筆，刋出這封神秘短簡之後，還附了幾句感想：有的說，「因何同室操戈」？也有的說，「江戶十五世紀俠客作風，重見今日」！又有什麼「俠盜　　向福爾　斯之挑戰，必有好戲可看」？還有的說，「軍人爲國效忠，自應竭其所長，並非邀功，何必妬嫉？旣覺不憤，理應光明正大，挺身而生，在大衆前一較短長，不較勝於鬼鬼崇崇之技倆耶」等等。</p>
<p>飛機事面，八個行人，就有五六個各買了幾份第二次增刋；報雖不同，恰第刋着這封短簡，並且說明鶴見乘的這架「畏勝」號。七個人雖不認識鶴見，當然猜想得出；因爲他們是一個團組，鶴見則是孤身一人。</p>
<h3>還鄉詩紀</h3>
<p>— 品白華</p>
<p>喚起王維畫不成</p>
<p>我該可以自傲，我的生長地有着「名山」，中國是多山的國家，不過，山要淸與秀，才成其爲名。那麼，千載以上謫仙李太白「自愛名山入剡中」的一句詩，並不是歪曲的；而同時，他還夢游過天姥山，所謂「一萬八千尺」的謫仙夢遊處，就在我的故鄉之東。但一件事往往結果會相反的，對於生長地故鄉的名山，十多年了，惜繼之情掩沒了自倣成分，因爲我早成了一個「東西南北之人」，沒有「騎款段乘下澤車爲鄕里善人」的福份。</p>
<p>然而，我終於歸來了，「淸風嶺」一過，剡溪像一條平練，迴環着峻邈的山峯，白雲，是山靈的外衣吧！它那麼自在地飄盪過一個山峯，一個山峯，　葱的樹林掩映出幾家白板屋，吿訴我午這裏面是一派的天然懷抱沒有染上都市的機心的。我想，這不但招引謫仙的詩意，而是一幅很好的畫，但好得太天然了，除非「畫中有詩」的王摩結來一幅「剡中圖」，豈不比「山谷鬱盤雲勢飛動」的「軸川圖」更好？</p>
<p>小包車在嵊縣停了，我知宗恩趁轉車的餘眼，去看了一下「聽　亭，」不過一塊土邱，述蔓着野草，在這樣地方有幾個人能「雙柑斗酒」去學戴安道呢！自然，深秋了，那兒尋得到黃鸚？就在對草業邊兜了一個圈子，我們上了開新昌的汽車，嵊新的相距只四十里，車厢中充滿鄉音，可是十多年關別的我，連鄕音也改了，鬢毛更不必說。尤其是一件布衣，誰還認得你？我於是踡伏着，怕聽鄉音。漸漸，古老的故鄕山城在望了，我拉宗恩跳下車，揀城脚跟的僻路走，不願讓「江東父老」發現這歸故鄕的還老樣一個窮小子。</p>
<p>夜了，故鄉沒有電燈，我記得在從前，這一點都市之賜是有的，大概「復原」不容易吧！這樣，一到夜，全地便墨黑，加上刦火中街道連民房燬去了十之七八，一片元礫，雖然。帶了「燈籠」走，還是很難找得着路逕。我的三間老屋，則「符其實」的變了屋嚴，裏面什麼東西都沒有了，我臨時下榻出參議會空舍。</p>
<p>一連幾天，叨了宗恩的光，吃飯不發生問題，因爲早晚都有着人請客的。然而我討厭，送來的帖子居然跟着「陳視察」後頭寫着「呂教授」字樣，斗大的山城而且公務人員最多三四萬元一月，縣長也不過十萬，排場，應酬，居然十分地都市化。</p>
<p>千　撲翠浴　襟，</p>
<p>喚起王維　不成；</p>
<p>逢掖歸來人不識，</p>
<p>後車畏長聽故鄕聲！</p>
<p>十年荒後尋三徑，</p>
<p>木石無情易主人；</p>

<p>音樂家簡史</p>
<h3>亨頓</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>亨頓（Haudel）德國的大音樂家與該國另一大音樂家巴黑（Bach)齊名。二人的區別表現在：巴黑生平深居簡出，全力從事敎堂音樂作品，其情調在悠靜中包含嚴　；亨頓則名噪全歐，著述歌劇作品，用筆飛揚流暢。惟亨頓努力之地並非德國，却在英國，其更重要作品，允在「法曲」。Otatorrum所謂「注曲」者，性質相近於歌劇，不過不登台表現，自歌自奏而己。亭頓生於1683年，殘於1759年。</p>
<h3>巴黑</h3>
<p>巴黑（Bach）德國人，爲近代西洋音樂之鼻祖，與亭頓齊名、作品大多爲敎堂音樂，惟在音樂中也常演奏。一生著作甚　生於1685年，歿於1750。</p>

<h3>失事</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>聖誕之日，有三雙飛機先後在上海失事，死傷七十餘人，這幕慘劇發生在這一佳節，誠勝不幸！</p>
<p>失事的原因，是由於濃霧，飛機無法辨認機塲，以致罹難。事後檢查殘機機骸，無一起火焚燬跡象，足以證明各機在上海市空盤旋甚久，油已燃盡，迫不獲已，惟有强行降落。這一天，僅有中國公司第147號一機，意外地幸運，得以强迫降落江灣機塲，略受損傷，機中人員徼倖無恙。</p>
<p>宿命論渚也許會張大其詞，曰：死生有數。其實，這個不幸雖曰上天不測風雲（濃霧），歸咎於氣候之變化，但善盡人力，仍是可以避免的。我們記得中國飛剪號，試飛太平洋航綫時，正遭遇到太平洋上的暴風雨，倘使不是完善的飛航設備，決不能順利完成這一飛行。濃霧固然是一大飛行的障害，如果用無綫電指導方向，如果地面的指示着陸設備（用光綫或聲音）完善，濃霧又何能影響安全？</p>
<p>今年這一年，飛行失事的紀錄，實在不能算少了，長此以往，難免令一般人們對於空中旅行不發生戒心，航空公司及交通當局是否應該仔細研討一下，對於一切設備及各種負責人員（包括駕駛，電信及地面人員）加以考核一番，庶可防患於未然。因爲人命關天，是決不能有所疏忽的。求盡善盡美，這不僅是給旅客以保障，更是對於中國航空事業的前途作至大的貢獻。</p>
<h3>歲暮贅語</h3>
<p>— 慈壽</p>
<p>「漲風」，「打風」，「搶風」，「倒風」，「大風起兮，百姓遭殃！」</p>
<p>民國卅五年即將過去，當我們迎卅六年光臨之前，不妨對今年這一年檢討一番。我想來想去，拿不出一個好的名詞來贈送給這一年，還是來給它一個「綽號」，稱這一年爲「多風年」。</p>
<p>近來天氣雖冷，可是外面的風並不算多，何以要稱它「多風年」呢，莫非我在掀風作浪麼？不錯，風的含義却是很廣；我所說的風，旣不是東南風，也不是西北風，而是指今年的「漲風」「打風」，「搶屬」，與「倒風」呵。</p>
<p>失脫「漲風」。每當一次漲風侵襲過來的時侯，人們就像昏迷的一樣，不知所措。等到漲風過去了，才甦醒過來，透一口氣。可是好景不常，第二次漲風却變本加厲的接踵而來，又使人們重入昏迷狀態。小百姓們就在這種循環不已的漲風裏度日子，眞不知物價要漲到那一天爲止呢？</p>
<p>再說「打風」。無論你在戲院裏，或是在球塲上，都可以看到這種風，源源不絕約有人在導演着。我不知道人性爲什麼變得這樣暴躁，一言不合就動手，打得落花流水，打得頭破血流，都是「像煞嘸介事」，樂得給人家着好看呀。</p>
<p>第三是「搶風」。這個年頭，生活不得解決，挺而走險的人不在少數，搶風也愈來愈熾。但是搶法各有巧妙不同，「强盜土匪」們在明搶，污官奸商們在暗搶。明搶的人倒說是生活不得解決而搶，暗搶的「人」又不知是爲了什麼？搶黃金，搶美鈔，搶物資，搶得不亦樂乎，無論怎樣槍法，反止私襄是不會像通貨那樣「膨脤」的搶得多用得多，互為因果，搶無止境！</p>
<p>最後說「倒風」這似乎是「壓台戲」，年關來臨，倒風盛行</p>
<h3>福建主席劉建緒</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>現任福建省主席劉建緒，保定陸軍軍官學校第三期　兵科畢業，離校後，歷任軍職，從排長遞升至集團軍總司令和第三戰區副司令長官。他在民國十七年以後，負責湘贛邊境的綏靖工作，迭奏摧毀廓淸之效，極得上峯嘉許。抗戰期內，馳驅東南戰塲，杭州彎一役，攻克鎭海，浙省局勢頓以轉危爲安。後縱陳儀就閩省主席，沿海失地隨即以次收復。他爲政始終恪守「三分軍事，七分政治」的原則，福建局面的漸見寗定，說明他的施政確已部份收效。</p>
<p>今年三月中旬，劉氏曾過滬，並假金門飯店邀宴福建旅滬同鄕。他本人是湖南醴陵人，面孔胖胖圓圖，格外顯出他的飽滿精神。</p>
<p>劉氏的元配陳氏，育有十三女五，一家人凑滿十個兒的齊頭整數。</p>
<p>他治家非常嚴肅，不許家人穿着奇裝異服，對於賭博，允爲深惡痛絕，並以此用作轉誠見女們。</p>
<p>福建自廿五年以來，人民飽受天災人禍及貪污剝削，現在正需要蘇息復員，人民無不深望劉主席勵精圖治，安定民生！</p>
<h3>烽火連天中　世外有桃源</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>隨着勝利而來的房荒，直到現在這個嚴重問題，還是無法解決。當局似乎也曾動過一番腦筋，計劃書是一份又一份，住宅區，平民邨，這些永遠是紙上談兵</p>
<p>最近被我「哥崙布」發現新大陸般地瞧到了一處貨眞價實的「平民邨」。在那裏呢？地點就在「西站」以及「新龍華」一帶，這裏的居民，彷彿是「桃花源記」中那般與世無爭，日出而作，日入而息。</p>
<p>這裏本來是荒地，可是現在，商店老闆呌苦，工廠主人嘆窮，都說年關難過，而且過了一關還有一關。這幾天來，他們大有「度日如年」之感，天天好比「大年夜」。我想，要不是從根本上去十着想安安定統一，任憑你拿出什麼賢明的辦法來，都抵擋不住這種倒風。</p>
<p>倒屬之後該又是什麼風，我不得而知。總之，今年是「多風年」。老實說，我們小百姓們，對這種年頭並不留戀；我們唯一的希望，是明年能够「風調雨順，國泰民安」，不再呌我們小百姓們受苦受難！</p>
<p>早已成爲新興的「平民村」了，新建的房屋，雖不是立體式的紅瓦火磚，不過　次櫛比的非常整齊，而且家家是獨門獨戶，住得十分自由而舒服，有臥室，灶間，客堂，門外的空地上種些荳麥蔬菜和葱菲之類，雖然沒有自來水，但，鑿池而飲，倒也不成問題，幷且每份人家蓄養些鷄·鴨·猪·羊。因此過年的菜餚，也許薪水階級的上海人，還沒這樣的豐富。</p>
<p>據親這裏的房屋是不用化「金條」頂的，都是蘇北同胞自己動手蓋搭，所需建築的材料，是由別處瓦礫塲所去搬來。老貿說，一毛不拔而住得那麼的舒服，也不用着二房東的險嘴，更母需化房錢，「捐稅」與他們是風馬一牛，雖然地主曾向他們交涉過，但這些蘇北同胞確是無處容身，常言道，只有這屋留人住，沒有拆屋趕人動身的，何况惻隱之心，人皆有之！</p>
<p>這個新興的「平民村」裏，也有若干家村店·烟紙店·小茶館·理髮店·搶餅攤，正是麻雀雖小，王臟俱全。</p>
<p>我從這裏看出了江北人的自立精神，江北同胞個個能刻苦耐勞，沒有依賴性，處處地方可以「不求人」過生活。小孩子們已懂得「拾荒」和賣茶而能不靠父母吃喝，所以我認爲江北人是很足效法的。</p>
<h3>狗尾喂狗</h3>
<p>— 加另</p>
<p>一個稅務員對着許多人發表宏論：「政府與人民猶如父子。保護子女不受敵人的欺侮，敎育他們，保養他們，莫不在在需錢，所以人民踴躍納稅，多多益善，實在是天經地義」！</p>
<p>其中一個人聽了說：「我明自了，是這樣一回事。</p>
<p>「我養着一頭小狗。它飢餓了，向我搖尾乞食。我對它說：『親愛的小狗，你很餓了吧？眞抱歉，讓我來銀你。」</p>
<p>「找了一把刀，切斷了它的小尾巴，再送到它的嘴裏：『吃吧！我忠實的好狗呀！吃了這塊肉補補身體吧，』」</p>
<p>稅務員不再嚕嘛了。</p>

<h3>民主與共和</h3>
<p>— 胡沂生</p>
<p>在中國，祇有「民主」，沒有共和，這缺乏共和的民主只是「唯我獨尊」，「我在這裹」。「我」是世界上最動聽的「音符」。</p>
<p>本來世界的趨向已普遍地自個人主義轉向到集體主義，而我國却還在個人主義的「民主」中求出路。究能求出些什麼呢？平添了好多「民主噱頭」與吃「民主」飯的新官僚，對於中國又有何補呢？吳稚老說過欲期世界大同須經三十六决小戰，七十二次大戰，這樣的「民主」下去，雖經七十二次小戰，一百四十四次大戰，「小同」也不會光臨！</p>
<p>我以爲中國的出路，不在民主而在共和，至少也得說：「共和允重於民主」。</p>

<p>賣藝求乞　（中）</p>
<p>（六）「眞假啞」——啞子是殘麽之一種，丐流也利用作爲乞憐的法宝。但有價假之分，其行業分爲四種。計爲「　天」，「呌口」，「當路」，「行實」。「瞞天」是貨眞價實的啞子，「呌口」却是習牌貨。本來開充啞十是最容易的勾當，其呌化分爲「當路』「行街」兩派。分道揚　，各不相犯。「當路」是跪路旁磕響頭，口中念念有詞，手指着天地，再指着自己的口和心，拍拍胸口求乞。「行街」是挨戶求乞。假啞十在求乞時相聚，向例不許談天，須回「御香堂」（丐廠）後才許開口。</p>
<p>（七）「鼻觀音」——此幫須足穿草娃，頭束草圈。「雙龍入海」是用毛竹削成兩根長應子，端懸絨球。求乞時將竹　揰沒到鼻孔裏，露絨球在外。「眞龍口」就是弄蛇穿鼻。兩派都是「一鼻孔出氣」。</p>
<p>（八）「坐他　」——四胶幾廠，坐路旁狂　·其　日：「好腳好手天堂路，壞腳壞手地獄門。明中去，暗中來，一錢不落虛空地。」歌聲抑揚頓挫，使人聞而生憐。</p>
<p>（九）「賣挖耳」——沿街售賣竹製挖耳的是丐幫的另一支派。幫中自稱「捧紗帽」，不知何所取義。但業此者都不肯自己承認是乞丐。大槪爲進進款不壞，巳經擠身於小販之列了。據說須能够右手捧着紗帽，左手能够單獨運刀製造，才算是看家本領。</p>
<p>（十）「苦肉刀」——本帮分「攔腰」「圍塲」兩種。攔腰丐上街時須先着上身，提着二尺來長的戒刀。不給錢時便在腰間硬擊，新起了一道道的紅痕。使店家又驚又憐，給錢了事。「圍塲」和江湖賣藝大同小晨，在路旁荒地弄一個　塲，向人求討。不過此輩並無江湖帮的好技藝，只是鑄茲亂敲一番，騙騙閒雜人等而已。</p>
<p>（十一）「舞光棍」——與上項同屬江湖賣藝的流亞，但爲江湖帮所不齒。一種稱「齊屬」，能將木棍舞得五花八門，一種稱「打光棍」，是用的三根短棍，一粗二細，沿街舞弄呌化。</p>
<p>（十二）「眞假　」——有價價啞子自有價假瞎子、而且假瞎子反多於眞瞎子。冒牌貨帮中稱爲「冷看」，亦妙喻也。手裏拿着竹桿，眼皮外翻，黑珠裏藏，虧他們還懂得化妝術。叫街的詞句有云：「抬頭不見天堂路，舉足不見路高低。」類此不能盡記了。「爛麗」坐乞也是屬於本帮的。表面上雖是瘡痍滿目，陳列路旁展覽。其實多數是利用丐帮祖傳的化妝術。此外還有跪在路旁　着響頭的，把前額磕成胡桃般巨塊的。也屬於本帮，待復詳述之。</p>
<h3>節屆年關　王小二出走</h3>
<p>— 吳蜀江</p>
<p>「我王小二不幸姓王，又不幸名呌小二，所以過去社會人士，譬如國事弄不好，商塲不景氣，他們自已不掙氣，都是用我王小二解嘲，「王小二過年」，「一年不如一年」。</p>
<p>我王小二不過窮一點，我可沒幹過危害國家的事時我也沒幹過奸商所幹的操蹤，投機的把戰，爲甚麼國事弄不好，用我來解嘲，商場不景氣，也用我來解嘲。小二自入民國以來，難碰到年關不聽到這侮辱我的話，我眞是夠氣的了。</p>
<p>現在抗戰勝利，勝利已一年多了，國事該漸入於正軌了，國家前途的光明，是近於燦爛光輝的境地了，商塲呢？經政府的指導，督促，不久當然是風平浪靜，日盛一日，民衆呢？經過這長期抗戰勝利後，更當然要發奮，圖強，作一個新民，我王小二當此舉國歡騰迎接三十六年的時候，我正式向國人告別，永遠告別，深願從此社會上沒有我這王小二，更願從此社會上碰到事情弄不好，莫再用我王小二解嘲。」</p>

<h3>The National Government and Executive Yuan Will Be Reorganized Immediately; Legislative and Supervisory Committees Will Increase in Number; Consultation on the Establishment of a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee Is Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] After the closing of the National Assembly, the reorganization of the government has become an important issue of national concern. It is learned that the government is conducting consultations with various parties. The National Government and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized simultaneously. The People's Political Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan will also increase the number of committee members within the shortest possible time. However, the rumor that the number of legislative committee members will be increased to 500 is unreliable. According to relevant personnel of the Legislative Yuan, after the closing of the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan should draft many legal items within three months, and the relationships are also significant. Therefore, it will be one of the most burdensome departments among the various ministries and academies of the government.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] It is reported that when the National Government and the Executive Yuan are reorganized, the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans will also undergo slight changes. It is said that the number of legislative committee members will be increased by 50 during the transitional period. The number of supervisory committee members will be increased by 20 to 30. The newly added quota will accommodate various parties and non-party members.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] According to Article 10 of the Preparatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Constitution, after the Constitution is passed, the National Assembly representatives who formulated the Constitution will organize a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, and the measures will be determined by the National Government. It is heard that the measures are expected to be announced before the promulgation of the Constitution, and the components of its composition are currently under negotiation.</p>
<p>[United Press, South 6th] Government officials said that the government is currently drafting the organizational regulations for the Constitution Implementation Promotion Committee. The committee will be composed of 50 representatives from various parties participating in the National Assembly and prominent figures in society. In addition to assisting in the implementation of the new constitution, it will also undertake work similar to that of the Standing Committee of the National Political Council. It is heard that the abolition of the National Political Council is under consideration. It is also learned that the government has begun to review existing laws, and those that conflict with the new constitution will be abolished or revised. Officials here believe that the current Civil Code and Criminal Law will not be subject to many changes, because all laws that restrict the freedom of the people or are considered inconsistent with democratic principles have been automatically suspended by the government after the victory.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The 31st meeting of the Presidium of the National Assembly is scheduled to be held at 10:00 am on the 27th to make a final decision in principle on the conclusion of the conference affairs and future matters.

On the 26th, he hosted a luncheon for Li Daming, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Jiang Juntian, etc. It is scheduled to host a luncheon for Chen Qitian, Zeng Qi, etc. of the Youth Party on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] At the closing of the National Assembly, each representative received a gold-shining commemorative badge, and each reporter also received one, but the color was rotary gray, which was far inferior to the former. However, its significance as a commemoration is the same. It is heard that the former is worth 140,000 yuan each. If lost, no replacement will be provided.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 26th] Sources in the diplomatic circle: After the closing of the National Assembly, the government will still send senior officials to Yan'an.</p>

As for the CCP's position on the National Assembly, it is indeed out of touch with the times. The new Constitution has in fact implemented the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and stipulated the organization of the American presidential system of a coalition government and other special innovations in China. All of this, the democratic politics of the West and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's philosophy, are included. The coalition government will be established at the time of the formulation of the Constitution.

<h3>The League Has Continued Discussions on Its Attitude Toward the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Sun Baoyi, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters that the Democratic League's request for the Democratic Socialist Party to withdraw from the League was expected. The Democratic Socialist Party, as an independent political party, stated at the beginning of its establishment that if the Democratic League has any major decisions, it must be approved by the Democratic Socialist Party. At that time, the Democratic League did not have any reaction, which can be regarded as tacit consent. And the Democratic Socialist Party's decisions do not have the obligation to seek the consent of the Democratic League in advance. Since the convening of the National Assembly, the Democratic League has not held a meeting to decide not to participate in the National Assembly, which is particularly noteworthy. Sun said that there are only about 20 members of the Democratic Socialist Party participating in the Democratic League. How these 20 people will handle themselves in the future is a problem that is of some concern, but the Democratic League is not a political party, so there is no such thing as inter-party or not. Sun emphasized that the Democratic Socialist Party will never split, and said that after the Democratic League made this decision, the promotion of the party's affairs may be more convenient than before. The reporter then asked whether the Democratic Socialist Party would still cooperate with the Democratic League if peace talks were reopened in the future? Sun replied: The meaning of the Democratic League's decision this time is non-cooperation within the League, and cooperation outside the League is still possible.</p>

The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 pm. The League is scheduled to continue the meeting at 2:00 pm today to discuss the League's attitude toward the current situation.</p>

The National Army outside the regiment has abandoned some unnecessary strongholds in order to concentrate its strength for defense.

<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 26th] The Communist army in the southern Hebei area previously launched a bloody struggle in the Guangping, Feixiang, and Daming areas, reporting landlords and middle peasants and non-Party members, and inflicting extreme penalties, which was extremely cruel. The general public, who were forced to follow, did not agree with this move, and therefore left the Party and surrendered to the government.</p>

<h3>With the National Assembly Closing, the Constitution is Produced, and the Representatives are Much More Relaxed</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 25th Dispatch] The National Assembly Hall today truly resembled a celebration, both warm and bright. People came and went, and everyone smiled when they met. Everyone felt that one thing was off their minds, but one more burden was on their shoulders. This burden is what every citizen of the Republic of China should bear from today onwards.</p>
<p>When Wu Zhihui, as chairman, presented the precious only copy of the Constitution to Chairman Chiang, it was like Santa Claus bringing the most precious gift.</p>
<p>Hong Lanyou had a freshly cut haircut and wore a swallow-tailed礼服礼服, busy up and down, truly like the protagonist of a celebratory family. When Hong read the credentials, his tone was extremely steady and pleasing to the ear, a world apart from the fatigue bombing of the past forty days.</p>
<p>Inside the assembly hall, the representatives greeted each other with talk of returning home, nothing more than what tools to take, what date to leave, and the many farewell banquets. Truly, this parting will last another year, and we will gather again on this day next year, with boundless parting feelings that cannot be expressed enough. This is a bit of sadness amid the joy of the meeting.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, someone was calling out: "All colleagues who participated in the National Assembly in the 20th year of the Republic of China and are now participating in the National Assembly, please note that we used to formulate a provisional constitution, and today we have completed the Constitution. I hope that colleagues will gather together after the meeting to take a commemorative photo."</p>
<p>The draft Constitution of the Republic of China, starting today, changed one word and formally became "law." A constitution was bound in brocade and pasted with a red satin strip on the cover, with six gold characters "Constitution of the Republic of China"燙印烫印 on it. The font was enlarged three times according to the calligraphy of the Founding Father, which is precious and even more precious.</p>
<p>The Constitution was only passed at 3:00 PM today, but it was handed over by the General Assembly in the afternoon. It is said that this was accomplished by Ye Yi, an unsung hero, who is the secretary of the National Assembly. For this Constitution, he had spent several sleepless nights, but his handwriting finally became an immortal document in history.</p>
<p>This Constitution was placed on a specially made wooden frame, which was painted with a national flag and inscribed with the four characters "National Assembly" below. It was placed on the rostrum and surrounded by colored silk. Those who went on stage to view it were endless, and photographers came in droves, using various methods and angles to capture their artistic portraits.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, Wu Zhihui and the chairman came, with Wu in front and the chairman behind. When the meeting adjourned, the chairman still let Wu go first, but Wu repeatedly declined, and the chairman smiled and stepped out first.</p>
<p>When Secretary-General Hong and Minister Wu Wentao went on stage to hold the handover ceremony, Hong was in front and Wu was behind. When they came down, they declined each other, with Wu taking the lead and Hong following. These were all meaningful shots.</p>
<p>When Chairman Chiang gave his speech, all the representatives were always in high spirits, so thunderous applause broke out in the hall at any time, and the sound of Long Live the Republic of China echoed endlessly.</p>
<p>The busiest people in the meeting place were signing autographs. Reporters, assembly staff, and representatives were all busy looking for people to sign autographs, especially Yu Zeng, whose pen never stopped.</p>
<p>After the National Assembly, the term of this session is over, and the crown will be taken off and re-dressed as a commoner.</p>
<p>The photography business in front of the assembly hall is good. Before and after each meeting, groups of people always gather there to take group photos. Although it is raining today, they still can't rest. It is said that the General Assembly is preparing to take a group photo of the representatives, but the location is difficult to find. The final decision is the mausoleum, but the weather is not good, and it can't be taken on a rainy day. Tomorrow, everyone will be planning to return home, and most of them won't be able to take it.</p>
<p>The representatives' last snack is Mei Lanfang's play, which has already been staged at the Lizhi Society tonight, and will be staged at the Dahua tomorrow. The representatives are in for a treat.</p>
<h3>Wuxing Silk Industry Faces a Severe Crisis; Cloth and Department Stores Close Down One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing Dispatch] This county produces silk, which is famous throughout the country. Since the victory, due to the stimulus of soaring gold prices, the oppression of high-interest loans, the heavy burden of various donations and taxes, and the increase in wages, business has plummeted and the future is in danger. Although the authorities have requested the Four Joint Branch to provide silk loans to help us get through the Lunar New Year, the Four Joint loan method is too harsh and is still under negotiation. Other cloth and department stores have suffered heavy losses due to the weak purchasing power of the people and the sluggish market, and are unable to maintain themselves. More than a dozen stores have closed down one after another within a month. Recently, Tongyu Silk and Cloth Store, which has been open for the longest time and has the largest scope, also suddenly closed down on the 24th of this month, and asked lawyer Jiang Zhongming to declare liquidation. Keda Cloth Store is also selling off its inventory in preparation for closing down. In the past three days, the prices of daily necessities and daily commodities have suddenly soared, with no end in sight. Fried dough sticks and sesame cakes have suddenly doubled in price, greatly threatening ordinary people and salaried workers.</p>

<p>[Our Hukouguan Dispatch] At half past four in the morning on December 24th, a pig boat heading east from Wangting, carrying 49 large pigs, was passing through Jinji Ferry at about 4:15 when it was suddenly attacked by a bandit ship lying in ambush there. Six bandits, armed with a pistol, boarded the ship to search for valuables. Because there was no cash, they tied up all nine people, including the boatmen Ji Zian, Ji Rongxiang, Ji Pingshou, Pan Jin'er, and pig merchants Mr. Cao and Mr. Ji, and passengers who took the convenient boat to Shanghai to visit relatives, and threw them into the river. Boatman Ji Rongxiang, because the rope was loose, struggled and escaped, soaking wet, and ran to the Hukouguan Town Self-Defense Corps to report. After the town chief reported the incident, he immediately led the Self-Defense Corps and 14 members to the scene to search for the bandits for more than four hours, but to no avail.

<h3>Moutet Arrives in Vietnam for On-the-Spot Investigation; French Army in Hanoi Advances in Fan Shape; d'Argenlieu Explains French Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] Amid reports of French Colonial Minister Moutet's on-the-spot investigation in Vietnam, Viet Minh has been advancing in a fan shape in Annam and Tonkin in the north. Viet Minh troops are still putting up strong resistance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] According to a recent communiqué issued by the French General Staff in Hanoi, the only places completely controlled by the French army are where the capital of the Viet Minh government is located. Viet Minh troops are still stubbornly resisting in the surrounding areas. The communiqué stated: "The situation in the center of the city is peaceful, and the mopping-up operation has already begun."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 25th] The French military headquarters has just issued a communiqué announcing that the French army continues to make progress in Vietnam. It briefly stated that the French army has already surrounded the Annamese residential area of Hanoi and is currently carrying out mopping-up operations. The Viet Minh resistance is still very active, but the French army is still advancing towards the cemetery. Another French army team, departing from Hanoi, arrived in Bac Ninh this morning and is now continuing to advance towards Phuc Mai Song. In the Nam Dinh area, the Viet Minh army is still attacking the railway station day and night. Corpses of Viet Minh soldiers and several Japanese soldiers have been found. Although the Viet Minh army suffered heavy losses, it is still launching military operations with a very large number of people. The Hai Tang Railway Bridge has been destroyed by the Viet Minh army. A batch of French reinforcements has arrived in Hai Tang from Haiphong. The suburbs of Haiphong are currently being heavily bombarded by Viet Minh mortars. The French army in Lang Son and Da Yen has now made contact. 3,500 Viet Minh soldiers attacked Hue on the 19th of this month and were repeatedly defeated by the French army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] France today launched to strengthen its political and military fronts in Vietnam. The first brigade of the French parachute regiment has sailed from North Africa to Vietnam aboard the cruiser "Duguays Trouin."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 26th] French Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet flew here last night from Calcutta. All French high-ranking military and political officials in Vietnam welcomed him at the airport. Moutet, in response to reporters' inquiries, only said that he wanted to inspect the situation on the ground and did not want to say much. He would only stay in Vietnam for a short time and planned to return to France around January 16th. He obtained the full consent of the National Assembly for this trip, and our policy of protecting the French people and friendly nations will not change.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 25th] The arrival of French Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet here has caused a great shock here, no different from the situation when the Viet Minh government fled. Political observers generally believe that the presence of Minister Moutet and French High Commissioner to Vietnam d'Argenlieu in Saigon proves the French government's willingness to reach an agreement with the Viet Minh government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 25th] General Leclerc, commander of the French Far East Forces, visited Vietnam. He passed through here last night, rested briefly, and then went to Calcutta. According to Reuters, Leclerc received the following instructions before his departure: (1) Study the military situation; (2) Study the causes of the conflict and ways to restore peace; (3) Estimate the total number of reinforcements needed; (4) Report the findings to Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet. The report added that the French authorities plan to transfer another 20,000 troops to reinforce Vietnam, to be transported by the French mail ship "Île de France" and the former aircraft carrier "Béarn."</p>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 25th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam d'Argenlieu gave a broadcast address to the French residents here today, the content of which was that France would not agree to the Vietnamese people's demand for complete independence. Independence is nothing more than a myth and has serious harm to the interests of both France and Vietnam. However, France is willing to fulfill the local autonomy agreement. If unconditional and complete independence is granted at the current stage of the Vietnamese people's evolution, it will not be a blessing for both sides.</p>
<h3>Vietnam Designates Neutral Zones to Protect the Safety of Overseas Chinese; Our Consul-General's Negotiations Have Failed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 26th Dispatch] The situation in Vietnam has deteriorated rapidly in the past week due to the French military action and the Viet Minh government's resistance. The lives and property of our overseas Chinese compatriots in Vietnam have been greatly damaged. They have submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting negotiations with both France and Vietnam to designate "neutral zones" in cities with concentrated overseas Chinese populations such as Haiphong and Hanoi. It is reported that our diplomatic authorities are considering this proposal.</p>
<p>In addition, the negotiations between China and France on the implementation of the agreement on the Vietnam issue, which were resumed on the 20th, have stalled again in recent days. The current chaotic situation in Vietnam urgently requires on-the-spot investigation in Vietnam before a number of issues can be decided, such as the demarcation of the free zone in Haiphong, the design of the Yunnan-Vietnam joint transportation method, and the valuation of compensation for materials and equipment, which cannot be carried out. However, the French delegation still in Beijing and our responsible negotiators all hope that a solution can be found quickly to the crux of the Franco-Vietnamese issue so that the situation in Vietnam can return to peace and allow these negotiations to achieve results as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 25th] In the recent conflicts between French and Vietnamese troops, only one overseas Chinese victim has been identified so far, and the loss of overseas Chinese property is minimal. However, the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the European residential area have not been damaged. French troops are currently stationed at the border between the overseas Chinese area and the Vietnamese area. The Chinese Consul General in Vietnam entered the area yesterday to contact the Vietnamese and overseas Chinese in order to delineate a neutral zone, but announced this morning that his mission had failed and that he would continue to work to make this plan a reality. In addition, according to French officials, General Morière, the military commander of the French army in North Vietnam, has agreed to establish a neutral zone.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese in France Hold Demonstrations; Demand Immediate Ceasefire Between France and Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 26th Broadcast: Four hundred Vietnamese residents in Bordeaux, France, held a demonstration in support of the Viet Minh government, distributing leaflets calling on French workers to unanimously demand that Vietnam be granted independence. They were dispersed by the police without any casualties.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] Citizens and soldiers of the Republic of Vietnam in France held emotional demonstrations over the Vietnam incident. Demonstrations were held in Toulon, Bordeaux, Moulins, Marsan-Conde, Montluçon, and Lyon. The numbers ranged from 1,500 to 200 people. They chanted slogans such as "French troops no longer stationed in Vietnam," "Respect the Franco-Vietnamese agreement," and "Long live Franco-Vietnamese friendship," and demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities within the Republic of Vietnam, or they would go on a hunger strike.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Meeting: Prime Minister Reports on the Situation in Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The French Cabinet met today to hear Prime Minister Blum report on the international situation and recent developments in Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] According to an official gazette announcement, during the absence of the French Overseas Colonies Minister Moutet, his duties will be temporarily assumed by the Minister of State, Laurent.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 26th] "The New York Post" recently commented on the establishment of the French Fourth Republic under difficult circumstances, considering it worthy of attention. It stated the reasons as follows: In terms of domestic affairs, the first thing to pay attention to is the failure to form a government that truly represents all parties, but instead one formed solely by the socialist party. That party only accounts for one-sixth of the members of the National Assembly. Secondly, the financial difficulties are currently causing France considerable distress. Thirdly, post-war vitality has not yet fully recovered. In terms of the international situation, France's foreign policy is indecisive between the East and the West. The long-term instability of the government cannot alleviate these difficulties. Regarding the Vietnam situation, France needs to engage in a colonial war when it is already overwhelmed, which only increases the difficulties. However, considering the deeply ingrained humanitarian spirit of the French, there is still reason to be optimistic about the future.</p>
<h3>German POWs Joining the War: Desertion During Battle</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 25th] According to travelers arriving here by plane from Bangkok, German prisoners of war participating in the French army in Vietnam deserted during a battle between the French army and the Viet Minh forces in northern Vietnam. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. The French army is conducting strict inspections along the Vietnamese border, so it is difficult for the outside world to know the details. However, it is said that people in Bangkok are aware of the German POWs joining the French army and their subsequent desertion.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union is Not to be Outdone: Whaling Ships Head to Antarctica; Japanese Whaling Fleet Actively Working</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 25th] Soviet newspapers today reported that a Soviet whaling fleet, consisting of nine ships and one large supply ship, has set sail from the Soviet Union to Antarctica.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Company, Tokyo, 26th] According to an announcement today by the Natural Resources Bureau of General MacArthur's Headquarters, the Japanese whaling fleet heading to Antarctica had already begun capturing two large whales on the 17th, one a blue whale and the other a fin whale, both captured by the Yokosuka fleet. Subsequently, the fleet captured thirty-one more whales in five days. According to a telegram this morning, they arrived at the fishing grounds on the 24th. The Nagasaki fleet has also begun fishing, capturing twenty-six whales on the first day. Furthermore, a British inspection team boarded a Japanese whaling ship on the 6th of this month in the Long Pack Strait to observe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated that there is no basis for the rumor that the US State Department has requested the British exploration team stationed in Marguerite Bay, Antarctica, to vacate their occupied base for use by the exploration team led by US Rear Admiral Byrd. The British exploration team in the Falkland Islands occupies buildings they built themselves and has an observatory. Although assistance will be provided to other exploration teams that arrive, the food supplies are insufficient for more people.</p>

<h3>Patterson's Speech: America Desires Peace</h3>
<p>The Purpose of Universal Military Training is to Maintain National Security</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] Secretary of War Patterson delivered a Christmas speech to American wounded veterans, stating, "We desire peace. Peace is still very far away, but the major powers must agree to discuss disarmament with each other so that the world may have hope that peace can be achieved soon."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] Regarding the implementation of universal military training in the United States, President Truman stated, "I intend to delete the word 'military' from universal military training because the meaning represented by the word 'military' is already contained in what I have in mind for training." The War Department today released a booklet emphasizing the importance of universal military training. It stated that the majority of universal military training will focus on physical development, and subjects related to religious education will be added. Some courses in universal military training already have educational significance, but education is merely a by-product of training. The purpose of training is not to establish a similar system outside the existing educational system. Universal military training must contribute to national security, otherwise, it should not be implemented.</p>

<h3>Asian International Conference to be Held in March Next Spring: Nehru to Meet Gandhi to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] It was announced here today that the Asian International Conference is scheduled to open here on March 24th next year and close on April 3rd. Invitations have been sent to thirty-two countries, but no responses have been received yet, and no country has indicated that it cannot participate. Among non-Asian countries, only Egypt has been invited to participate. The conference will likely be opened by Jawaharlal Nehru, Deputy Chairman of the Provisional Government of India. Preparations are being made by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, Mrs. Naidu.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Regarding the conference to be held by the people of Asian countries in Delhi, the non-partisan magazine "The Spectator" commented, "The recent political tactics adopted by Jawaharlal Nehru, Deputy Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, are aimed at launching his own pan-Asian movement. Nehru's plan is supra-religious and supra-ethnic in nature, and its purpose is to organize a common Asian front to counter the exploitation of Western countries. It differs greatly from Japan's 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' concept. This plan is truly pan-Asian, and its scope is extremely broad, encompassing everything from Japanese Shintoists in the east to Lebanese Christians in the west. It holds an optimistic view, believing that all Asian people can cooperate hand in hand with love and understanding. Nehru's plan, like the concepts he holds, is extremely grand. But whether Nehru believes that a pan-Asian federation can tolerate the existence of Pakistan, and whether the leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, is willing to unite Asia considering that the pan-Asian federation will be led by Hindus, are all questions. Jinnah believes that as long as Nehru is the head of the Indian government, Islam is in danger, and the Archbishop of Jerusalem agrees."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 26th] Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of India, Congress President J. B. Kripalani, and the party's Secretary-General, Roy Buchwo, will fly to Calcutta tomorrow to discuss the current political situation with Mahatma Gandhi. It is reported that Nehru will return here next week to preside over the Indian Science Conference, which will open on January 2nd, and scientists from various countries will come to participate.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 26th] Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, son of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his wife, recently returned here today after traveling in Poland and the Soviet Union for eight weeks.

Colonel Roosevelt traveled to the Soviet Union at the request of the American magazine "Look" and will now write six travel articles for the magazine. It is said that most of the content is about the Soviet Union's recovery. The younger Roosevelt has repeatedly expressed disagreement with American foreign policy in the past, believing that it does not conform to his father's ideals, and he advocates that American foreign policy should be formulated after consultation between Republican and Democratic leaders, and must be unified in opinion.

<h3>British Ambassador to Spain Has Been Recalled to London: British Government First to Implement UN Resolution; Spanish Newspaper Accuses British Ambassador of Transgressing</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th] British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Victor Mallet, has been recalled to his home country and arrived here by plane today. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution in New York, calling on member states to recall their ambassadors to Spain to express disapproval of the Franco government. Mallet is the first ambassador recalled by the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 26th] British Ambassador Mallet departed for his home country today. Madrid newspapers recently published news that made Mallet feel uneasy, alleging that the British Embassy here had actively participated in the anti-Franco movement. In fact, although the British Embassy here has had contact with various factions in Spain while engaging in customary social activities, as far as British reporters know, anti-Franco figures in Spain are still dissatisfied that the British and American embassies have not dared to actively sympathize with them. The internal relations of the various anti-Franco factions in Spain have not improved in the past year. When Britain, the United States, and France issued a declaration on March 4th, expressing their hope that the Franco government would voluntarily step down and establish a provisional government to hold general elections, the royalists among the anti-Franco factions were greatly angered. By July and August, negotiations on unified action among the various anti-Franco factions had almost completely stalled, and the factions still could not agree on the form of the future government of Spain. In September, the Communist Party abandoned cooperation with the various factions and decided to adopt resolute republicanism, further dividing the anti-Franco factions in Spain.</p>
<h3>A Major Post-War Issue: Repatriation of Japanese Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>The three million people from the Chinese mainland have already been repatriated. In addition, there are still one million people who were originally in the Northeast. Due to the complexity of the national situation, the fate of these Japanese is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Repatriating millions of Japanese prisoners of war and expatriates from China to Japan is indeed a huge and difficult task, but with the cooperation of China and the United States, it can be said that it has been "successfully completed."</p>
<p>On the day the Japanese Emperor announced the unconditional surrender edict, the day the Japanese army laid down their weapons, was also the day the World War and the Sino-Japanese War officially ended. There were four million Japanese soldiers and expatriates in China, but after a year of efforts, three million of them have returned to their homeland. The remaining one million were originally in Manchuria (the Nine Northeastern Provinces). Due to the unfathomable Soviet policy, the repatriation of these one million people cannot be resolved for the time being, and the United States also feels powerless.</p>
<p>Larns, a special correspondent for "World Report Weekly," recently issued a report from Shanghai, explaining the details of the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians very clearly. The main points are translated below.</p>
<p>The repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians began in December of last year with Sino-US cooperation. The method was to systematically disarm them first and gradually concentrate them. However, because China is vast and the Japanese soldiers and civilians are widely distributed, it had to be carried out in different regions. At that time, it was decided to deal with South China, Taiwan, and Vietnam first. In more than three months, a total of more than 600,000 Japanese were repatriated. The next was Central China, with a total of more than 800,000 Japanese repatriated. Finally, North China, with a total of about 554,000 Japanese repatriated, the latter of which was only recently completed.</p>
<p>When the repatriation work was underway, a noteworthy conclusion was reached regarding the extent to which Japanese expatriates had penetrated into China: the ratio of Japanese soldiers to expatriates was three to two. In other words, for every three Japanese soldiers repatriated, two civilians were repatriated. The progress of the repatriation of Japanese soldiers had a dual impact on Japan itself: on the one hand, there was a general sense of comfort, feeling that nationals scattered in various places had finally returned; on the other hand, it caused various economic worries.</p>
<p>On the positive side, many families were able to reunite, surplus manpower could be applied to production work, and the government would not be at a loss when drafting reconstruction plans. This raised the prestige of the United States a lot, because the United States, unlike the Soviet Union, was able to abide by the responsibilities stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<p>But on the negative side, the cost of repatriating Japanese soldiers and civilians had to be largely borne by the Japanese government, and this expense was considerable. At the same time, it was really a tricky thing to accommodate so many returning soldiers and civilians in Japan's fragmented economic structure after the war. What's more, the food and housing problems became even more serious. But no matter how bad the negative aspects were, the Japanese still felt that the rapid progress of the repatriation work was worthwhile. Therefore, no matter how huge the expenditure was, they still hoped to quickly send the one million Japanese soldiers and civilians in Manchuria back to their country. But this matter is more complicated because the Soviet Union is involved.</p>
<p>The rapid repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians from the US-controlled areas has made the Japanese feel dissatisfied with the Soviet measures. This can be seen from the recent demonstrations held by the Japanese in front of the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, demanding the acceleration of the repatriation work. The Soviet Union has always paid close attention to Japan and has widely publicized the glory of communism and the Soviet Union's concern for the Japanese people, but the twists and turns of the repatriation work have obviously been a major blow to the work of the Japanese Communist Party and the Soviet delegation.</p>
<p>After many compromises, the Soviet Union finally decided to repatriate 10,000 to 15,000 Japanese people per month from a port in eastern Siberia (recent reports said that MacArthur and the Soviet authorities had established an agreement to repatriate 50,000 people per month—translator), but the Japanese still could not feel very satisfied, because the United States repatriated Japanese from mainland China, the peak of the work had reached as many as 12,000 people per day.</p>
<p>Another thing that made the Japanese dissatisfied was that the Soviet Union was preparing to send Japanese civilians first and delay the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war as much as possible. According to various estimates, there are at least 800,000 Japanese soldiers in Soviet hands. The United States believes that 700,000 of them have been transported from Manchuria to Siberia to work in labor camps. The Japanese believe that this violates the Potsdam Declaration. At the same time, if the current method is followed, it will take at least several years to repatriate one million people.</p>
<p>Of course, no one can predict how future developments will unfold, because the situation may change at any time. But one thing is very noteworthy, that is, the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians from mainland China has been completed. The war that Tokyo has always called the "Sino-Japanese Incident" has finally come to a formal end after a long nine years. (Translated by Ya Nong from "World Report Weekly")</p>
<h3>Celebrating Christmas: British King's Broadcast Address; Encourages Nationals with the Word "Courage"</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] British King George VI spent Christmas today with the royal family at Sandringham House, sharing dinner together. Turkey and plum pudding were the main dishes. After the meal, the King entered the study and broadcasted a Christmas address to the nation in front of a gold microphone. Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and princesses were all present to listen. The King encouraged the nation with the word "courage." His words were as follows: "Today, on Christmas Day, the Queen and I are gathered in the palace with the royal children, sharing this joyous occasion. We think of the British Empire as a large family spanning the globe. The war has left the world with scars and rubble everywhere. Politicians bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing the world, and the past year has been a tireless effort, which is no easy task. Only by continuing to be patient and acting in good faith can the world return to normal. When Britain was bombed, we demonstrated our spirit, and in the future, we should still be able to show the same spirit with patience and discipline. Today, as free people, we celebrate Christmas in a peaceful environment. People still feel the lack of necessities in their daily lives, but we should not worry too much about the current difficulties, we should think of the great future. Mobilize the spirit of Christ to remedy our daily lives and relieve the suffering people everywhere."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th] The Archbishop of Canterbury issued a Christmas message today, calling on people to increase their faith. He said that the situation is difficult, and the moral and physical conditions around the world are perilous, and everyone and everyone's spirit is oppressed by it. How can we still talk about increasing faith at this time? But Christmas tells us how to obtain peace and joy, and human beings cannot create peace and joy by themselves. Christ came to give peace and joy, and human beings must humbly accept it.</p>

<h3>International Female Devil: Venomous Old Beauty</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Valley Dan, the captain of the Nice Mobile Reconnaissance Team, arrested a venomous beauty yesterday, suspected of killing more than twenty people. The arrested woman is Madame Tang Doulan, also known as the Baroness, and some even respect her as the Marchioness. She spent most of her fifty years in the Middle East, especially in Syria and Lebanon. In 1936, her husband, Baron Bell, was assassinated in a hotel in the Syrian desert, suffering nineteen stab wounds. The hotel was established by the Baron. Madame Tang sought revenge for her husband, resulting in the arrest of two suspects. However, two French military officers publicly suspected that the murderer was Madame Tang herself. Shortly thereafter, the two officers were almost run over by Madame Tang's car while out. The two reported to the police station, but to no avail. Later, Tang Doulan remarried a Muslim and lived in the home of a relative of the Arab king, in a state of virtual house arrest. In 1939, she secretly went to Mecca, the holy land of Islam, in order to sell a large quantity of jewelry and diamonds of unknown origin. She had previously seduced an official of a certain embassy, so she was able to leave the country smoothly. After arriving in Mecca, she plotted to kill an Arab chieftain, which angered the king, who sentenced her to death. However, she had great connections and escaped to North Africa. During World War II, she was even regarded as a political prisoner and given protection. This August, Tang Doulan came to Nice with her son (a reporter for a Nice newspaper) and began to enjoy life. Until recently, the mother and son were arrested for trafficking in gold, but her son was soon released. Reconnaissance Team Captain Valley Dan had followed her throughout Syria, Lebanon, and North Africa. According to him, "She is a most dangerous woman, she knows how to use poison or a dagger." It is said that fifteen to twenty men have died at her hands, but the police station is keeping the entire case a secret. Details will probably be released after the prisoner is escorted to Paris.</p>

<h3>Flight No. 48: Rushed Past Runway, Destroyed in Rice Field: Plane Body Caught Fire, No Survivors</h3>
<p>The body and nose of Central Air Transport Corporation flight No. 48, which crashed in the rice field of Zhangjiazhai, Jiangwan-Zhanghuabang, were completely split and burned, with only the tail remaining. When reporters went to inspect the site yesterday afternoon along a muddy path, they still saw thick smoke rising from the remaining parts of the tail. In the rice field, there was a liver and lungs, purplish-red in color, and a severed female foot. Two people in military uniforms and a village child were groping in the rice field. One claimed to have found a gold ring, and the village child picked up several thousand-yuan and five-hundred-yuan banknotes, squatting in the rice field to wash away the mud.</p>
<p>The plane took off from Chongqing at 8:00 a.m. the day before and arrived in Shanghai airspace at 5:30 p.m. Due to the heavy fog, Longhua Airport did not have blind landing equipment, so it turned to Jiangwan. According to Central Air Transport Corporation, the plane made contact with the ground at that time, but due to the heavy fog and poor visibility, it rushed past the runway and crashed in the rice field, catching fire.</p>
<h3>People Sitting Inside Their Homes, Disaster Comes from the Sky: Four Residents of Zhangjiazhai Killed or Injured</h3>
<p>Two civilian houses in Zhangjiazhai were looted and destroyed, with the roof beams knocked several feet away. Although the two houses had been built for several years, the villagers nearby still called them "new houses." The householder, Zhang Guoye, works for the telegraph bureau and is currently in Nanjing. His wife, Zhang Qunxian, died on the spot. The villagers also call Zhang Qunxian "new bride," even though she has given birth to three children. Zhang Yuezhi, eleven years old, and Zhang Xinzhi, nine years old, were both seriously injured and have been sent to the hospital. Zhang Lindi, eight years old, was fortunate to only have scraped skin. Zhang Guoye's old mother, Zhang Lu, was also seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>A tiled house next to the destroyed houses was fortunately not affected. According to people in the house, around six o'clock the night before, they were having dinner when they heard two loud cracking sounds, followed by a deafening roar and a flash of light, as if a bomb had landed. The foundation of the house also shook. After the plane crashed, it caught fire and burned. They tried their best to put out the fire, but because the gasoline was burning fiercely, they could only move the straw on the side of the door and pour manure from the manure tank. At the same time, American troops stationed at Jiangwan Airport also rushed to help, and the fire was prevented from spreading, but the embers did not stop until dawn.</p>
<p>All eleven passengers and pilots and radio operators on the plane died.</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of the Central Air Transport Corporation flight No. 48 accident, Wu Lieqi, the secretary of the flight group, led many senior officials from the foreign affairs section, the general affairs section, and the vehicle allocation section to the accident site at 8:00 a.m. yesterday to transport the bodies of the victims to the China Funeral Home for injection and cleaning work. Soon, China National Aviation Corporation also sent the victims of the company's crashed plane to the China Funeral Home. As there were many bodies to be dealt with, Central was concerned that the funeral home would be too busy to cope, so after 7:00 p.m., the bodies were moved to the Central Funeral Home on Gordon Road, Mabai Road, and it was decided to perform the coffin sealing ceremony today. It is said that most of the victims have been identified by their families.</p>

<h3>A Shocking Scene Beside Hetamiao Temple: Crash Site of Flight No. 115, Tragic Sight of Broken Planes and Dead People Everywhere: Corpses Mostly Ice-Cold from Night of Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Shanghai flight No. 115 crashed in a pond to the right of Hetamiao Temple on Qiansan Road (from Qianliang Temple to Sanlintang) near the No. 3 bridge on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway. Reporters drove to the site yesterday morning in the wind and rain. After passing Shanghai Provincial Middle School to the south for several kilometers, there is a lane that can only accommodate a jeep, leading to Hetamiao Temple. The temple is close to the Huangpu River, four li away from the highway. From a distance in the car, one could see the silver-white wreckage of flight No. 115. Upon arriving in front of the temple, the first thing that caught the eye was an unbearable sight: twenty-nine bodies of deceased passengers, male and female, young and old, were lying in rows on the banks of the small stream in front of the temple. Among them were nine female corpses and three children's corpses. Their clothes were still intact, but having been subjected to a night of wind and rain, the corpses were all ice-cold. Five of them had their elbows bent upwards towards the sky, like statues. One corpse had its skull smashed and brains overflowing, another had a foot severed, and several had bloodstains on their faces, but most had no obvious injuries. According to nearby villagers, all the corpses were pulled from the small pond next to Hetamiao Temple, so some of the dead must have jumped out of the cabin when the plane was about to crash and drowned in the pond. It is also said that three people still had breath when they were rescued last night, but because it was midnight and transportation was inconvenient, there was no way to rescue them, so they soon died.</p>
<h3>A Love Letter: The Person is Dead, But the Thing Remains</h3>
<p>Flight No. 115 was destroyed in the small pond surrounding Hetamiao Temple. The nose of the plane was cut off, the right wing was broken, and the tail was split, but the body of the plane was still intact. Its landing state was completely like a normal stop. The western half of Hetamiao Temple was destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A mud statue of a "servant" in the temple had fallen to the ground, but the temple god in the main hall was still sitting unharmed. The open space behind the temple faces the wreckage of the plane. Fragments of documents and papers are scattered everywhere on the ground. At the cut-off point of the nose of the plane, business cards and blank checks toothpicks and other items were found. The reporter also picked up a "love letter" stained with mud. The date was the 23rd of this month, probably written by a female passenger on the plane but not sent. It read, "Dear ××, the date of departure still cannot be determined, I am really anxious... Yours, ××." Reading it makes one feel heartbroken. Broken clothes are still hanging on the branches of trees in the open space. The remaining clothes and other items in the plane are being cleaned up and piled on the lawn in front of the temple by personnel from China National Aviation Corporation.</p>

<h3>A Loud Crash, Firelight Illuminating the Sky: Elementary School Principal Escapes Death</h3>
<p>Although Hetamiao Temple was badly damaged, fortunately there were no casualties. However, Sun Jianjin, the principal of the private Huadong Elementary School in the village, escaped death. Principal Sun stays in the western part of the main hall of the temple every night. Around eight o'clock the night before, he was fast asleep when he suddenly heard a loud crash and woke up from his dream. At that time, the bed curtains had fallen down, and he felt that his feet were being pressed down by a heavy object. In a hurry, he poked his head out and saw firelight illuminating the sky. At that time, he never thought that a plane had crashed, but thought it was a fire caused by lightning, so he hurriedly got out of bed, put on his clothes, and fled. At this time, he was panicked and confused, and the east hall had been destroyed, so he could not identify the direction. Later, he calmed down a little and went around the bamboo garden behind the temple to the neighboring house, where he joined the villagers in ringing gongs to rescue. Principal Sun told reporters yesterday about the situation at the time, and smiled and said, "Fortunately, I have always slept with my head to the east and my feet to the west, otherwise my head would have been crushed and I would have died."</p>
<h3>Drizzling Rain on the Road: Pedestrians' Souls Ready to Break</h3>
<p>While the reporters were inspecting the surrounding area, two family members (male) of the victims came to identify the bodies. Obviously, the relatives they were looking for were among the corpses, so they were filled with tears. The county government had also sent people to handle the matter, but by the time the reporters left (2:00 p.m.), the bodies had not yet been moved. At this time, two cars were parked on the side of the road, and a woman in the car was looking around with tearful eyes. Seeing the reporters, she opened the car door and stood in the rain to inquire. She said that she was the wife of Le Zuolin, the general manager of Qinghua Paint Company. Her husband had called to say that he was taking China National Aviation Corporation flight No. 115 to Shanghai. This morning, after learning about the plane crash, she had inquired at various hospitals but had not found him, and feared that he had died. While speaking, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Also, the personnel from China National Aviation Corporation who were taking care of the scene yesterday prohibited reporters from taking pictures of the corpses. One foreign staff even held an iron rod and tried to rush towards a photographer from a certain newspaper, which aroused public outrage and almost caused trouble.</p>
<h3>Fifteen People Receiving Treatment in Zhongshan Hospital: Yu Peng Has Died of His Injuries: Zhang Chunhua and Xue Jinfan Least Injured</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, Dr. Hoey (C.F. Hoey), the medical director of China National Aviation Corporation, went to Zhongshan Hospital to visit the injured passengers rescued from the two crashed planes of the company. China National Aviation Corporation sent three batches of injured people after the accident the night before, a total of fifteen people. The first batch of seven people: Yu Peng (seriously injured), Zhao Jixing (male), kidney laceration, bloody urine, skull fracture, unconscious. Liu Tengxiang (male), concussion. Chen A'er (male), right leg broken. Zhang Qiyun (female), injured head and left leg. Min Wanzhen (female), injured head and knees. Unnamed (female), has been unconscious since being sent to the hospital. The second batch of four people: Zhang Chunhua (male), fractured tibia and fibula of the left foot. Wu Rongbing (male), fractured ulna of the left hand. Xue Jinfan (male), injured arm, relatively minor. Preus (male, the captain of flight No. 115), seriously injured head and face, unconscious. Two unnamed children, one died at 6:50 p.m. yesterday, less than one year old. The other had two legs broken, about one year old. The third batch of two people: Wang Xiaode (male, the radio operator of flight No. 115), dislocated knee joint, four fractures of the femur, tibia, and fibula, brain laceration, in critical condition. Xu Weilong (male), injured head and face.</p>
<p>Among the aforementioned fifteen injured, Yu Peng died of his injuries yesterday morning. The unnamed female and Wang Xiaode extended until last night. Also due to serious injuries, they have entered a dying state. The rest are still in good condition. Among them, Zhang Chunhua and Xue Jinfan, passengers on flight No. 115, were the least injured. They were even allowed by the doctor to have a brief conversation with reporters.</p>
<p>Zhang Chunhua is a Beijing opera actor who sings the role of a male clown. Only his right ear and left heel were slightly injured. He is currently in a second-class ward on the second floor. At that time, a female friend named Zhou was comforting him. Zhang performed on the same stage as Li Shaochun at the Hankou Grand Theater, until the 16th when his contract expired. He could have returned to Shanghai with Li at the same time, but the theater had not yet paid Zhang the agreed fee, so he was delayed until the 25th before he could set off. He originally planned to rest in Shanghai for a while before immediately going to Tianjin to perform, but unexpectedly encountered the accident.</p>
<p>According to Zhang, the plane arrived in Shanghai airspace around 7:00 p.m. He was asleep at the time. When he woke up in extreme impact, the plane had already crashed. Zhang woke up from a coma and didn't even know he was injured. When he tried to stand up, he realized that his left leg was broken, and he rolled around next to the plane. It was not until after midnight that someone came to rescue him.</p>
<p>Xue Jinfan is a department store merchant who came to Shanghai from Chongqing to purchase goods. He had six partners traveling with him, and only Xue survived. Xue was sitting in the middle of the plane and only knew that it was impossible to land, and did not expect anything else. When the plane suddenly fell at the end, he lost consciousness. When he woke up, he saw that he had been thrown out of the plane and was lying on the river beach. Next to him was a woman, Xue himself had the ability to help each other, Shang Tu went forward to help, but unexpectedly it was a dead body. It was then that he realized that he himself had been injured and fell to the ground exhausted. After being rescued to the hospital, his condition was very good, and his relatives and friends had visited him many times.</p>
<p>The American pilot of flight No. 115, Preus, was seriously injured. When Dr. Hoey of China National Aviation Corporation entered the room to visit him, he was still unable to speak. His head, cheeks, and other places were all wrapped in gauze and silk ribbons. His left leg was fractured. Dr. Hoey instructed the doctors in the hospital to move Preus to the best ward, hire a special nurse, continuously transfuse blood when necessary, and use X-rays to check for internal injuries in the chest and abdomen. He also said: There is no problem with medical expenses, everything will be paid by China National Aviation Corporation. If Preus can be rescued, he will probably be the only pilot saved from the three crashed passenger planes.</p>

<h3>China Airlines Announces Cause of Accident: Attempted Blind Landing Resulted in Crash, Total of Sixty Passengers on Both Aircraft</h3>
<p>China Airlines issued the following public announcement yesterday regarding the cause of the recent accident:</p>
<p>It is with deep sorrow that China Airlines announces the loss of two passenger planes flying from Chongqing to Shanghai on the evening of December 25th. Aircraft No. 140, a C-47 model, piloted by J.M. Greenwood, co-piloted by Liu Linsen, and accompanied by radio operator Jin Keng, took off from Chongqing's Shanhu Ba Airport at 10:15 AM, with scheduled stops in Wuchang and Nanjing. Aircraft No. 115, a C-46 model, piloted by R.B. Preus, co-piloted by Tan Xingzheng, and accompanied by radio operator Wang Xiaode, took off from Chongqing's Baishi Yi Airport at 10:30 AM, with a scheduled stop in Wuchang before flying directly to Shanghai. Both planes departed Wuchang in close succession, fifteen minutes apart, with</p>
<p>the weather in both Nanjing and Shanghai being suitable for landing at that time. However, as they approached Nanjing, the weather in both cities suddenly deteriorated. Since Wuchang Airport lacked night-flying equipment, it was impossible to return. Both Nanjing and Shanghai airports were equipped for night landings, with Jiangwan Airport possessing more advanced blind-landing and night-flying capabilities. Aircraft No. 140, originally scheduled to stop in Nanjing, attempted to land there, but due to the weather, the airport was completely obscured. The pilot then continued to Shanghai. Aircraft No. 115 arrived over Shanghai at 5:30 PM, followed by Aircraft No. 140 an hour later. At that time, the weather in Shanghai was similar to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 140 first attempted to land at Jiangwan Airport using the blind-landing equipment. The pilot circled over the area for over an hour, repeatedly attempting to land. However, due to a malfunction in some of the plane's radio equipment, it was impossible to utilize the blind-landing system. Although communication with the control tower was possible, the signal was too weak to establish contact with the blind-landing equipment. After attempting for another hour, it was determined that landing at Jiangwan was impossible, leaving no alternative but to proceed to Longhua. Upon attempting to land at Longhua Airport, visibility remained at zero. After several attempts, the pilot finally notified the control tower that the plane was out of fuel and had to make a forced landing. During the landing attempt, while correcting the landing direction, the plane crashed at the southwest end of the airport at 7:55 PM. As for</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 115, it circled over Jiangwan Airport and was able to establish contact with the blind-landing equipment, although the signal was sometimes unclear. Under such circumstances, a safe landing was also unlikely. At approximately 9:00 PM, it flew from Jiangwan to Longhua Airport. The weather had slightly improved by this time, and visibility gradually increased. After repeated landing attempts, the final attempt was nearly successful, requiring only one more circuit to change direction. Unexpectedly, at this precise moment, the plane crashed one mile southwest of the airport at the Huangjia Du River Temple Pagoda. The cause of the crash remains unclear. Aircraft No. 115 circled over Jiangwan Airport for three and a half hours. For the first two hours, Aircraft No. 140 and another China Airlines plane were also in the air.</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 147</p>
<p>In addition, two other aircraft, China Airlines Aircraft No. 147, landed safely at Jiangwan Airport at 7:40 PM. While Aircraft No. 140 was attempting to land at Longhua, China Airlines executives and aeronautical personnel were present at the airport, along with the airport's fire brigade, ambulances, medical personnel, etc., all on standby. The municipal police department and fire brigade were also notified and dispatched to the scene in case of emergency, allowing for timely rescue efforts after the accident. As for Aircraft No. 115, news of its accident was received approximately one hour after contact was lost. The U.S. military and U.S. Navy assisted in the search, with numerous boats dispatched by the water police and the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>Reconnaissance Along the River</p>
<p>Aircraft No. 140 carried 27 passengers and 3 crew members. Aircraft No. 115 carried 33 passengers and 3 crew members. The injured have all been taken to hospitals. Unfortunately, the number of fatalities is quite high. The names of the passengers and other detailed information will be disclosed after further investigation.</p>
<h3>Newlywed Couple Die Together; Wife of National Assembly Representative Dies as Well</h3>
<p>In the International Funeral Parlor, the deceased lay quietly, many bodies already covered in flowers. The situation was different in the Chinese Funeral Parlor. Piles of corpses were stacked together, with blood, mud, and rainwater staining their clothes beyond recognition. The grief-stricken families could sometimes only identify their relatives by a single high-heeled shoe! The sound of weeping shook the ground; it was a tragic sight.</p>
<p>Xia Changjun, a victim of the China Airlines crash and a grain specialist from Shao, and his wife, Xia Wu Shuzhen, died together. Xia Changjun's death was particularly gruesome, with one leg severed. Yang Xizhi, the former Special Commissioner of Grain Administration, personally identified the body yesterday. Xia's wife's relatives fainted in grief upon seeing the remains! The Xia couple had only been married in May of this year, and unexpectedly became ill-fated lovers in less than a year! Liu Linsen, the co-pilot of the China Airlines plane, also perished in the accident, and he had only been engaged for two months. Yesterday, Liu's fiancée went to identify the body, and the scene was even more heart-wrenching!</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao, the mother of a National Assembly representative from Liaoning, Shenyang, also known as Zhao Wang Yuxian, along with her son Zhao Jixing, boarded a plane from Chongqing to Beijing to visit the representative. Due to weather changes, the flight was diverted to Shanghai, and they unexpectedly met with disaster, mother and son dying together. Zhao's second son, Zhongxing, has arrived at the International Funeral Parlor to identify the bodies and arrange for the funeral. He has also urgently telegraphed Representative Zhao in Nanjing to come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>At the International Funeral Parlor, someone recognized a deceased person as their relative, Zhang Qiyun. However, Zhang Qiyun was resting peacefully in bed number 30 in room number 6 of Zhongshan Hospital. She was still able to speak, and she confirmed that she was indeed Zhang Qiyun. It was later discovered that there had been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The U.S. military police, or MPs, were driving quickly through the wind and rain in a Jeep to transport the injured to the hospital the night before. Unfortunately, the vehicle was traveling too fast and struck a pedestrian, Li Chen, injuring her head. As a result, she was sent to Zhongshan Hospital along with the crash victims.</p>
<p>At Zhongshan Hospital, two airplane tickets were found near the body of one of the victims. One ticket was in the name of Yu Peng, and the other was in the name of Zhang Zhenjiang, making it impossible to determine the deceased’s identity.</p>
<p>Next to the wreckage of China Airlines Aircraft No. 115, rescuers found a little boy wearing a floral cloth coat. Thank goodness, he was completely uninjured! When reporters arrived at Zhongshan Hospital, he had already been safely taken to the hospital and was asleep. He said his name was Wang Didi and that he was four years old. Who his parents are and where he came from are currently unknown. On the eve of Christmas, he may have been a beloved and happy little angel - but now he has become a wandering orphan!</p>
<p>Wang Didi, a Survivor, Is Surprisingly Safe and Sound</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Console Bereaved Families and Supervise Safety Measures by Both Companies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Communications is paying close attention to the accident and has dispatched Li Bohou, Director of the Navigation Administration Department, and Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Department, to Shanghai as quickly as possible to comfort the injured passengers and the bereaved families, and to supervise the two airline companies in taking emergency safety measures. With the winter season of ice and fog upon us, all flights will be suspended in adverse weather conditions with poor visibility to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Aircraft No. 140 Crashed, Damaging Another Parked Aircraft</h3>
<p>China Airlines flight from Chongqing to Shanghai, number 140, crashed near the main runway of Longhua Airport. The wreckage was cleared yesterday morning by the company using a crane. The No. 6 Red Cross ambulance, which overturned near the runway in the darkness while rescuing the injured and dead the night before, was also towed away. Scattered pieces of the aircraft can still be seen on the lawn at the crash site, along with a pile of torn clothing and shoes, blurred with blood stains. Some of the passengers were carrying Guang oranges from Sichuan, which now share the same tragic fate as their owners. Orange peels are scattered everywhere and have not yet been cleaned up.</p>
<p>On the night of the plane crash, the aircraft circled over the city for two to three hours. Finally, when the fuel ran out, the nose of the plane plunged directly to the ground, hitting the wing of another parked aircraft upon landing. The aircraft itself then flipped over several times and was destroyed.</p>
<p>While the two aircraft were circling over the city, Wu Shi, head of the company's aeronautical engineering group, McDonald, the chief pilot, Gao Dajing, head of the business group, Wu Zhihong, manager of the Shanghai ticket office, and American director Schweitzer, along with experienced pilots, were all waiting at the airport. Chief pilot McDonald personally directed operations from the control tower. Shen Desie, General Manager of the company, Mr. Lai Nuo, representative of Pan American Airlines, and Dr. Salade also arrived one after another to supervise the rescue efforts, continuing until the next morning without rest.</p>
<h3>Shipyard Fire</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] A fire broke out in the carpentry workshop of the Jiangnan Shipyard in the Nanshi district at 10:15 last night, lasting for approximately two hours. As a result, ten workshops were destroyed. It is reported that the cause of the fire was an electrical fault.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Seized and Resisted Arrest; All Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] At 8:30 last night, a transport truck fully loaded with goods was speeding east on Weidemei Road in Jiangwan, in front of Fudan University. A patrol team from the Xinshi Street Police Station saw the truck and immediately ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, someone in uniform in the truck suddenly fired two shots at the police officers and continued to accelerate westward. The police officers returned fire with twelve shots, but were unable to intercept the truck. Afterwards, the police officers telephoned the station and learned that the truck belonged to the Gongda Motor Company. Xiao Jun, a member of the second division of the station, along with plainclothes police officers Liu Renqian, Lv Wenxuan, and Shi Chenghou, drove to the Gongda Motor Company to investigate. They learned that the truck had indeed been dispatched to Jiangwan at 5:55 pm yesterday. After waiting until 9:30 pm, the truck returned to the company. The police officers detained the driver, Wang Zhengming, for questioning. According to his statement, not far from the company, five men in uniform boarded the truck and ordered him to drive directly to the vicinity of Jiangwan Airport, where twenty boxes of white paint and seven pieces of five-hundred-pound steel plates were loaded onto the truck. He was then ordered to drive back to Shanghai. In front of No. 19 Qufu Road, near Tiantong Road, the truck was stopped and more than twenty people were waiting. All the goods on the truck were unloaded before he was allowed to return. According to the driver's statement, the police station immediately went to No. 19 Qufu Road. However, the criminals had already fled upon hearing the news. The police only found all of the stolen goods in the house and arrested the wife of the shop owner, Zhou Genbao, taking her back to the police station. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>

<h3>President Song Summoned Responsible Persons of Cotton Textile Industry Yesterday; Discussed Measures to Suppress the Rising Price of Yarn and Cloth; Stopped Rationing of Reproduced Cotton Yarn for Market Stabilization; Requested Purchase of Raw Cotton with Foreign Exchange, Half of the Finished Products Should Be Allocated to the Management Committee</h3>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, went to the Bank of China building at 9:00 AM yesterday to handle official business. At 10:00 AM, Mayor Wu Guozhen and important responsible persons from the Sixth District Machinery and Cotton Textile Industry Association, including Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Guo Dihuo, and Tang Xinghai, paid a joint visit. Song received them and held a meeting for one hour, the content of which focused on suppressing the rising price of yarn and cloth, and deciding on issues such as increasing production. The principles can be divided into: (1) Stop rationing of reproduced cotton yarn and allocate the original quantity to the Spinning Management Committee for market stabilization at any time. (2) Private factories request foreign exchange to import raw cotton. After the finished products are produced, half of them should be allocated to the Management Committee for sales to the market to suppress the rising market price, and a part of it should be exported to exchange for foreign exchange. Regarding this method, the Spinning Management Committee should first draft a plan, set up a small group meeting to review it, and then submit it to the general meeting for approval, and it will be implemented on a trial basis starting from January next year. (3) It is hoped that private factories will promote the sale of domestic cotton as much as possible to save foreign exchange. Subsequently, Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank also reported to Song in detail that the Central Bank's sale of gold in Japan had been effective. At 12:00 PM, Song also met with Zhao Dihua, Xu Weiming, Hu Huichun and others from the financial community for discussions. At that time, Song also invited Xu Weiming to have lunch together. At 2:00 PM, he returned to write. After 4:00 PM, Song summoned Shu Yunchang of the Textile Construction Company and Yang Xiren of the Spinning Management Committee. At 6:00 PM, he also met with Xu Jizhuang, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, for discussions.</p>
<h3>In Light Rain, the Mayor Inspected Pudong, Inspected Yangsi District and Investigated Household Registration; Inquired About the Living Conditions of Shantytowns in Yangjing District</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] At 2:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Office, and Chen Baotai, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, braved the rain and took a municipal ferry across the river at the Dongjiadu Wharf, and took three special vehicles to inspect the Yangsi District of Pudong. Accompanied by Zhu Youguo, the head of the district, he went to Yangsi Middle School to visit. At that time, the students in the school were in class. Then, he went to the Health Sub-Office of the district to inspect. Tang Shenqi, the director of the office, reported on his work. The office was established three months ago and has achieved excellent results. However, the start-up funds have not yet been received. The current equipment and furniture are borrowed and donated by local gentry Chen Tianxi. Mayor Wu also went to the Yangjing District, accompanied by Zhang Ruoxu, the head of the district, and personally went to the Dongchang Road area to inspect the shantytowns. The mayor personally entered the dark shantytown homes, inquired about the living conditions of the women, and verified the household registration, which was accurate.</p>
<p>Although it was raining lightly yesterday and the roads were muddy, the mayor did not tire of seeking details and investigated the household registration very carefully. Local gentry Chen Ziqin also diligently served three courses of tea and snacks.</p>
<p>According to Qi Peiran, Director of the Yangsi District Branch of Pudong, the district has 102 administrative police officers and a security police squadron, so local security is absolutely worry-free. The mayor was also very satisfied with the household registration work in the district and returned to the municipal government at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Calculations of Some House Donations and Construction Donations Have Problems; The Financial Committee of the Council Resolved to Request the Municipal Government to Reply</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] The Financial Committee of the Municipal Council held its sixth meeting at the Hongqiao Club yesterday afternoon to continue discussing tax revenue and other issues. Hu Wenyuan, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, attended to explain. The matters discussed at the meeting: (1) Regarding the Finance Bureau's "Implementation Measures for the Collection of Food in Kind and the Discount of the Food Tax in 1935" and the "Provisional Measures for the Collection of the Food Tax and the Temporary Verification of the Grain Registry," the councilors Lu Shidao and Wang Weiyin were recommended to review them. The review opinions were submitted to the municipal government for reference. According to Deputy Director Hu's explanation: The city's food tax grain registry has always been in the hands of clerks (also known as "land skin ghosts"). Currently, the bureau is assigning personnel to verify according to the above-mentioned method. Since its implementation, the results have been very good, and there has been no harassment. The large-scale collection of the food tax can begin in February next spring.</p>
<p>(2) Citizens, the Chamber of Commerce, and alternate councilors have all proposed to the Municipal Council that the Finance Bureau's collection of the autumn house donation and municipal construction donation in this city is not calculated based on the rental value in the 26th year of the former Public Works Bureau. They requested that it be corrected. The committee decided to send these opinions to the municipal government for reply. Deputy Director Hu also explained: The Slaughter Tax Law, the Feast and Entertainment Tax Law, and the House Donation Regulations have all been amended by the national government, and there are many differences from the current system. Based on the city's collection experience, the Finance Bureau feels that there are some aspects that are not completely suitable for the local situation. It has repeatedly explained the reasons and telegraphed the central government for further amendments. This time, it is also prepared to submit it to the second general meeting of the Municipal Council for research. If the new tax law is implemented, it is estimated that the city's tax revenue will decrease by 3 billion yuan per month. Recently, the Executive Yuan ordered that local governments can levy three types of special taxes, but they must be approved by the public opinion organs. The municipal construction donation and the travel lodge donation in 1936 are still planned to be included in the budget, based on this order.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the urgent request of the city's ballroom industry association to exempt the ballroom beverage tax and the request of the instrument and stationery industry association to exempt the business tax, it was decided to invite Finance to respond.</p>
<p>(4) The association also approved the telegram from the Qingdao Municipal Council, unanimously advocating that all land business tax revenue should be allocated to the local government. In addition, the property rental income tax, property sale income tax, and stamp tax should still be allocated by the central government, and the allocated percentage should be increased to 50% of the net income. It was decided to recommend that the second general meeting discuss and decide.</p>
<h3>Gu Guansheng Accused of Burning Down a House</h3>

<p>Increasing the Allocation to Retailers</p>
<p>[Our reporter] Confirmed information: The relevant parties are actively improving the supply of coal for winter use in this city. The Fuel Management Committee has purchased more than 10,000 tons of coal in Vietnam and dispatched three special ships to transport it to Shanghai immediately. Although the conflict between France and Vietnam is intensifying, transportation is expected to be unaffected due to prior arrangements. As for the distribution of coal briquettes, the authorities are paying close attention to cracking down on the black market. The amount of coal briquettes sold at the factory outlets will be restricted as much as possible, and the maximum amount will be allocated to retailers, who will then distribute them in different areas. Detailed records will be available for inspection, so the black market will not be allowed to arise. The Social Bureau will convene a coal price review meeting today to discuss the profits of retailers and technical improvements in the distribution in different areas.</p>
<h3>Public Opinion; The Council Has Received More Than Seventy Letters of Opinion</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] The Municipal Council has received letters of opinion from citizens for several days. As of yesterday, more than seventy pieces have been received.

<h3>Communicating the Suzhou Creek: Plans to Add Bridges in Various Locations to Facilitate Transportation on Both Banks</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Puxi area of this city is bisected by the Suzhou Creek, forming the areas north and south of the creek. There are more bridges east of Xizang Road, so north-south traffic is relatively convenient, and the Hongkou area is more prosperous. West of Xizang Road, there is only the Xinzha Bridge, which can cross the creek, so the Zhabei area is very deserted. Moreover, those traveling from Zhabei to Huxi and Nanshi mostly cross the creek along the bridges in the eastern district, which increases the traffic burden on the Huangpu district. The current congestion of vehicles on Nanjing Road and Middle Zheng Road is also partly due to this.</p>
<p>Zhao Zukang, director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, recognizing this, has drafted a transportation plan for both banks of the Suzhou Creek, preparing to implement it gradually. Yesterday afternoon, he went to conduct on-site inspections with Lu Jifang, director of the Road Department, and Zhu Guoxi, director of the Structural Department of the bureau, and closely studied the bureau's near-term plan to communicate the transportation engineering plan for the north and south banks of the Suzhou Creek. It is reported that the plan includes adding bridges at Jiangxi Road, Hengfeng Road, Fujian Road, and Changshou Road, and addressing the bridge site issues, repairing the entire surface of Suzhou Road and the revetment, and organizing and widening the main roads such as Jiangxi Road, Chengdu Road, Huasheng Road, Hengfeng Road, Middle Zheng North Second Road, Changchou Road, and Guangzhao Road. The total planned amount is more than 9 billion yuan, which will soon be submitted to the Municipal Council for deliberation. After the completion of this plan, the benefit to the eight or nine thousand acres of land in the Zhabei area, considering only the increase in land value, would be at least 40 to 50 billion yuan, and the vehicle congestion in the Huangpu district would be greatly alleviated.</p>

<h3>The Banks of the Sichuan Gang Operate Stably and It Is Untrue That There Are Rumors of Instability</h3>
<p>Recently, a leading figure in the Sichuan silver and money industry told reporters that it is not true that there are rumors of instability in the banks of the Sichuan Gang. The branches of the Sichuan banks in Shanghai have their annual loans allocated by the head office, so at the end of the year, only the loans need to be recovered and returned to the head office. Therefore, the silver roots of the branches are tight, but there is no phenomenon of capital turnover. The Sichuan Gang banks have always followed the old rules in their usual business operations and are quite normal. They rarely go beyond the scope of the legitimate business of banks. Therefore, in recent days, the amount of exchange has been doubled to prepare for any eventuality. The banks that are passively shaken on the Daily Report can not be included in the Sichuan Gang banks, because they are all newly established by foreigners who lived in Chongjin during the Anti-Japanese War. The outside world does not know the truth, and it is a pity to mix them up.</p>

The next is Qingdao, with 300,000 spindles. So far, about six-tenths of the total have started production. The China Textile Shanghai Company has a total of 19 textile printing and dyeing factories. Due to power restrictions, only more than 560,000 spindles have started production. The cotton production season is approaching, and the company has sent people to various cotton producing areas to purchase domestic cotton. It is estimated that the total amount of domestic cotton picked this season is about 5 million dan. Except for local needs, only about 1 million dan will flow to the market. The company's target for purchasing domestic cotton this period is 800,000 dan, but it is still not enough for half of the raw materials needed for production, so it still needs to use foreign exchange to purchase American cotton. It is reported that the steps of China Textile's production increase plan for next year are: (1) Self-purchase of generators. It is now actively installing four small turbine generators in China Textile's No. 16 factory, with a total power generation capacity of 4,000 kilowatts, which is only enough for the factory's electricity needs.

<h3>Difficulties in Transporting Seafood; Please Handle the Transport Management Committee With Lenience</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The import and export industry seafood group meeting has been held. The industry believes that seafood comes from Southeast Asia, and the capacity of Indian ports is not very large. Therefore, European ships often do not stop when passing through India, so a lot of seafood in India as of November 17 has not yet been shipped. Moreover, foreign seafood is listed as prohibited imports, which has led to a sharp drop in seafood prices in India, and importers have suffered heavy losses and are in a dilemma. After this meeting, it was decided to submit a request to the Transport Management Committee to consider the special difficulties of the industry in transportation and handle it with lenience. It is also reported that there are a large number of import applications for goods ordered before the announcement of the new import and export order, but the Transport Management Committee has insufficient manpower, and very few import permits have been issued, which also makes importers feel quite anxious.</p>

<p>According to a person in charge of the Yizhong Cigarette Tobacco Factory in this city, after a large number of American cigarettes were imported into our country, the domestic tobacco industry has been in decline. Although the production and sales of domestic cigarettes are not as good as those of American cigarettes, the main reason is that the costs and tax rates are too high. Among the costs, labor is the largest, especially the year-end bonus issue, which makes major cigarette factories feel difficult. As for the tax rate, it has reached 100%, and the tax bureau also has plans to readjust it again.

<p>To the participating members of the International Cultural Cooperation Association: Promoting international cultural exchange to enhance sympathy and mutual assistance, and to maintain the collective security of mankind, is the common belief of all nations in the world today. Our country's position is closely related to peace in the East and the world, and is extremely important and significant. Communicating culture should be regarded as a top priority. Your association's establishment today has profound meaning in the future history of culture. In the past 30 years, the world's academic thought and scientific inventions have made unprecedented and superior progress. We must catch up quickly without stopping, so as not to be left behind and compete in an aimless manner. China's traditional culture is long-standing, and the thoughts of saints and sages are broad and profound. The relics of ancient cultural relics are also extremely comprehensive and rich. We should promote and develop them to achieve the effect of pushing oneself and others to blend seamlessly. For the advantages of the cultures of various ethnic groups, we should select the strengths of all to use as a resource for correcting our own shortcomings. Only in this way can we merge the sources of Eastern and Western culture and make a powerful contribution to all mankind in the new era. Due to the high level of scientific development, the distance between ethnic groups is getting closer and closer, diplomatic relations are becoming more and more frequent, and cultural relations are becoming more and more close. How to seek harmony and cooperation, and weigh the similarities and differences, to enhance the friendly spirit among nations is the mission entrusted to all of you today. You are cultural pioneers, selected from the academic community, and your association is a new organization in our country's cultural world. You must have grand words and brilliant insights to fully exert your strength and promote world harmony through cultural power. I am offering these ideas at this grand meeting and hope that we can encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Symposium in the City's Cultural and Educational Circles Discusses Textbook Issues; Renowned Educator Zheng Xiaocang Also Attends</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday (the 26th) at 9 PM, the city's cultural and educational circles held a symposium at 851 Yuyuan Road to discuss textbook issues. Those who attended included Ou Yuanhuai, Shen Yougan, Zhang Yaoxiang, Huang Shijin, Chen Qingshi, Gu Shusen, Shen Baiying, Yu Qingtang, Gao Junshan, Chen Heqin, Zheng Xiaocang, Yang Zhixian, Zhang Yiqu, Fang Shannong, Sun Huaicong, Zhang Wenyu, Fu Tongxian, Liu Dajie, Dong Renjian, Liu Ganliang, Li Ximou, and Chen Weixiong, Yu Zhenying, a total of 23 people. First, Mr. Chen Heqin announced the outline of the symposium, the main aim of which was to discuss textbook issues. Then, Mr. Gu Shusen gave a report, stating: The nationally compiled textbooks originated before the war. The Ministry of Education only regarded them as a kind of standard textbook and did not call them "nationally compiled." "Nationally compiled" was actually a name given by the outside world. At that time, only the Chinese language textbook for senior elementary schools was printed and distributed in a limited way. When the War of Resistance broke out, the entire unified distribution method was planned according to national policy. During the war, seven publishing houses, namely Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, Shijie Book Company, Datong Book Company, Kaiming Book Company, and Wentong Book Company, undertook the printing and distribution, each forming a "Seven-Publisher Alliance." After the victory, four publishing houses, namely Children's Publishing House, Culture Publishing House, Independent Publishing House, and Victory Publishing House, were added, which in fact had been opened up to an "Eleven-Publisher Alliance." The Ministry of Education, due to proposals from the Participatory Political Council, once advocated free opening, but due to various reasons, it is still carefully considering appropriate measures, and so on. Later, Mr. Chen Xiqin raised three questions: (1) Textbook editing issues: the advantages of nationally compiled and reviewed textbooks. (2) Textbook distribution issues: the importance of a free opening system versus the implementation of unified control. (3) Textbook content issues: a review of the current curriculum standards. Various experts expressed their opinions and discussions flourished until after 11 PM before dispersing.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Last night, before the symposium, Mr. Chen Heqin hosted two banquets to welcome the renowned educator Mr. Zheng Xiaocang, who had just returned from the United States. During the banquet, he elaborated extensively on current university education issues. Mr. Zheng advocated that universities should not be run behind closed doors in the future, but should go outside the campus and connect with the public. His words were very insightful. After the banquet, Mr. Zheng attended the symposium to participate in the discussion of textbook issues.</p>

<h3>Jingwu Cup Table Tennis, Grand Finals Begin Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The grand finals of the 5th Jingwu Cup All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship, the championship finals of the five groups, were held at 7 PM last night in the gymnasium of the Cishu Building, fourth floor of Jingwu Association. Referees were Chen Linsheng and Chen Limao, and Inspector Dai Yongquan. There were six groups of matches, with 300 spectators. The venue was small and could not accommodate everyone. More than 100 people were turned away, and it was a grand occasion for a while.</p>
<p>In the first group, Wang Youxin played against Fan Liangji. Wang was the most likely champion of this year's competition, while Fan was an unexpected dark horse, so there was a big difference in strength. Fan was easily defeated by Wang.

Although Chen lost, he was still brilliant. In the third group, Yang Kaiyun played steadily and easily defeated Hu Yiping. In the fourth group, Shui Hangao won the first game but declined later. They won one game each. Shui took the lead with 8-3 in the third game, but was taken advantage of by Li due to relaxation and negligence. Han Gao's skills were originally strong, but it was a pity that his spirit was often not concentrated. In the fifth group, Chen Zengliang lost 3-0. In the last group, Chen Xingquan won the first game against Wang Youxin. Youxin fought back and the match was very exciting, but in the end he won 3-1 against Xingquan.

<h3>Day 1 of Davis Cup Final: USA Wins Both Singles Matches Against Australia; Hurlburt Defeats Bromwich; Australian Star Suffers Unexpected Defeat</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Melbourne, 26th] The Davis Cup final was held here today. The sky was cloudy and the weather was hot and humid. No less than 14,000 fans came to watch. At 1:30 PM, the players from the US and Australia entered the stadium. The band played the Australian and US national anthems. The President of the Australian Grass Court Tennis Association, Bullock, delivered a speech on the merits of Davis, the donor of the cup. The entire audience observed a minute of silence. The opening ceremony was completed and the competition continued. In the first group, Australia's Bromwich played against the US's Hurlburt. Bromwich was an Australian national player and the hope of winning was strong, but he was defeated unexpectedly. The score was 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 0-6, 6-3. At the beginning of the match, Bromwich served first and was smooth, winning the first set in 23 minutes. Hurlburt came up in the second set and performed brilliantly. The last three sets became a battle of attrition. Both sides used long shots and never volleyed. In the second group, the US's Kramo played against Australia's Hean Choupears. Kramo was a better player and won 8-6, 6-2, 9-7. According to today's two sets of results, the Davis Cup has implicitly fallen into the hands of the United States, because Kramo's match against Choupears on the 28th will definitely be easily won. The United States has already won three of the five matches. Although the results of the remaining singles and doubles matches are difficult to predict, they are no longer relevant to the overall victory or defeat.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Melbourne, 26th] The Davis Cup tennis final was held today on the tennis courts of the Old Eagle Sports Ground. The 14,500 seats in the sports ground were filled to capacity today, making it one of the days with the most spectators since the Davis Cup competition began.</p>

<h3>A Record of Galloping Horses at Xin Suo Guan</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 8th Day of the Month; Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>I arrived in Yao County late at night. Although there were small shops outside the city, it was impossible to find lodging, and it was necessary to knock on the gate to enter the city. At this time, the sky was as black as ink, and you couldn't see your fingers. The desolate wilderness was silent at night, and only the barking of dogs echoed in the cold.</p>
<p>Yao County is built along the Qi River, with very high walls. To enter the city, one must cross the Qi River, and there is a gate on this side of the river. To knock on the gate, one must first knock on the gate of the outer defense. The so-called "blockhouse line" is only a little over ten li from the city. In Sanyuan in the morning, someone in the army told me: "When you get to Yao County, you may still hear gunfire. Just now there was a phone call saying that the Communists are attacking the line." Now that I have arrived at this "important place," it is already late at night, and I expect that the security will be extremely tight. Therefore, I devised a plan to "earn" my way through the gate. I draped a blanket over my shoulder and used a flashlight to explore the road ahead.</p>
<p>Earning Entry into Yao Gate at Night: The Gate Opens Under Red-Tasseled Spears</p>
<p>After walking for a while, I heard a loud challenge for the password in the darkness. I pointed my flashlight and saw a red-tasseled spear. It was a member of the local militia dressed in black. He stood across the gate, blocking my way. I explained where I was coming from and that I needed to enter the city immediately. The red-tasseled spear replied: "This gate is locked. Go look to the north." So I walked further north and encountered another red-tasseled spear. I thought that if this gate was also locked, I would have to find a way to get him to unlock it. Unexpectedly, the gate was ajar. I exchanged a few brief words with the red-tasseled spear. When he heard that I came from Sanyuan, he opened the gate without hesitation.</p>
<p>I crossed the Qi River on a flat stone bridge and went up a very steep, long slope. At the top of the long slope was the tightly closed city gate. After I knocked on the gate, a head appeared from the crack in the door and spoke to me. If I told him that I was a reporter from Shanghai, he would not understand and would not open the door. So I told him that I was from the local commissioner's office, returning to the city from Sanyuan with urgent official business. It seemed that the security was not as strict as I had imagined. While I was negotiating, two soldiers came up behind me. They took my place and spoke to the head in a commanding tone, ordering him to open the gate. The door gradually opened, and I saw that the head belonged to a soldier with a gun and ammunition.</p>
<p>We quickly entered the gate. There were no lights in the city, and it was as silent as death. Along the way, at street corners and alleys, we encountered many more red-tasseled spears. With the help of a soldier, I managed to get the door of a bathhouse-cum-hotel opened. The innkeeper was sleepy-eyed and made clicking noises between his teeth as he made my bed and brewed tea. Looking at the state of the inn, I understood the poverty of social life in Yao County, the so-called "gateway to northern Shaanxi." The water was salty, the bedding was black, and the brick bed was cold. Coupled with the snowy sky, the desolation was even more pronounced.</p>
<p>Generals Han Qi and Fan Zhongyan of the Song Dynasty once established their headquarters in Yan'an to defend against the three borders. The so-called "One Hundred and Twenty Qin Passes," of which Xin Suo, on the Cheng Yu road, was one of the most important passes. Defending the border outside the One Hundred and Twenty Qin Passes was a life of distant garrison service. When the situation became unfavorable, Fan Zhongyan established his headquarters in Yao County, which was then called Yao Prefecture. "Old Fan's belly is full of tens of thousands of soldiers," and the people of Yao County greatly admired Fan Zhongyan. The current county government is located where he had his headquarters. The place where this famous general of the western frontier held court and inspected his troops still exists, now with a plaque that reads "Jing Fan Tang," and serves as the county government's courthouse. The courtyard is narrow, with an old cypress tree. The light is dim, and it faces the drum tower in the center of the city, just a hundred paces away.</p>
<p>It gives people a sense of the border city's military atmosphere of the past, and one can almost hear the sounds of metal weapons and galloping horses.</p>
<p>However, Yao County is in Guanzhong, not the border city of the Han and Tang dynasties. But in the Eastern Han dynasty, there were also Western Qiang, and the entire Guanzhong region was a border area. From hinterland to border city, times have changed, and thousands of years have passed unnoticed. Outside the city, the Qi and Ju rivers flow gently, telling of the vicissitudes of life. It has always been "far" from Chang'an. Although it is now connected by railway, transportation is still difficult. The people of Yao County still look back to the past, believing in myths and legends.</p>

<h3>City of Myths</h3>
<p>Yao County also has a stele forest, a private collection of over sixty stone tablets, housed in a solitary, dark, and lightless building that feels like a cave. Most of them are Northern Wei votive inscriptions, with strange and unrestrained brushstrokes. Unlike the Longmen Grottoes votive inscriptions, there are few elegant and graceful pieces. However, there are two extremely complete Thousand Buddha steles. This cannot be compared with the scale of Yungang or Dunhuang, but the carvings are neat and detailed. Thousands of identical Buddha statues in relief equally illustrate the depth and surging tide of Buddhist culture. In addition, there are several Sixth Dynasty stone Buddhas with broken legs and feet. There are also a dozen or so tattered Republic of China army infantrymen who look like beggars. Some of them, like the Sixth Dynasty stone Buddhas, sit under the wall in front of the solitary building, watching the red-tasseled spears drilling on the large parade ground, chanting "one, two, three, four." Others pile up some dead branches and yellow leaves next to the Wei steles, burning them for warmth, the smoke stinging the eyes, nose, and throat. I squeezed into this small house that had become a smoke-filled cave, and with tears in my eyes, I finished looking at the strangely styled steles and stone Buddhas. The group of living stone Buddhas stood up and said to me:</p>
<p>"What should we do? Officer." I didn't know what to do either. After talking with them, they all began to chatter incessantly. They said that they were originally from the 22nd Army, stationed in Toutoulin, but were captured because "the Eighth Route Army attacked us." "The Eighth Route Army had so many men! How could we not be defeated?" I said that Xi'an had sent troops to rescue them, right? "That was after we were defeated that they came to rescue us!" They said, "The Eighth Route Army said to us: What are you fighting for? You fight, and then they come to rescue you. If you want to join the Eighth Route Army, you can stay here. If you don't want to, we'll send you back. We don't want to join. They fed us well on the way here, but when we got here, the county government only gave us two *cang* a day per person. How can we get enough to eat? They don't even believe us when we sigh. It's cold!"</p>
<p>So that's how it was. No wonder they were asking this "officer" what to do. They were wearing suspicion like clothing and given two *cang*, unsure whether it was relief or punishment. I asked around for them in this small city, but couldn't find a solution. The general trend made me understand that the solution had already been decided, which was to do nothing and let nature take its course.</p>
<p>The people of Yao County believe that they live in the middle of a boat. The Northwest lacks water, and they imagine that the place where they live is a boat. They have reason to say so: Look, there is a Ju River and a Qi River, and the county seat is like a boat floating in the middle. They don't know in what year, but a well was dug in the county government office, and the boat started leaking. Yao County was flooded. Later, they quickly filled it in, and cast a half iron bull to stabilize the boat, so that we could live peacefully. I did see a half iron bull. This has more practical significance than Noah's Ark in the Old Testament. They also boast of the Tang Dynasty calligrapher Liu Gongquan and the Sui Dynasty scholar Sun Simiao, the "King of Medicine" whom the people of northern Shaanxi piously worship. The Liu family north of the city was originally the ancestral home of Liu Gongquan, so this place name has been preserved from the Tang Dynasty to the present.</p>
<p>North of Sanyuan, the terrain rises continuously. From a distance, it looks like a mountain, but when you climb to the top, it is a plain. When you look at the outer mountain from a distance, you see a plain again when you climb up. It has a bold and imposing aura. This is the characteristic of the Qin-Long Loess Plateau. The place names in this area are all "something-yuan." The widespread use of the character "yuan" originated in Qinzhong. South of Chang'an is Leyouyuan, which in ancient Chinese literature represents beautiful scenery. But the "yuan" here is a village, farmland, the so-called edge of the Guanzhong Plain area. The Jinghui Canal area is uniquely blessed, and cotton can be harvested at a world record of 120 catties per mu, while here it is only twenty or thirty catties, a stark contrast, but still enough for a general standard. The soil is thin, and the water conservancy is insufficient, relying on the heavens for harvest. There is a saying in Qinzhong: "Eighty-three months of rain," meaning that there is hope for a harvest if it rains in the third, eighth, and thirteenth months of each year. This saying is especially applicable to the arid areas north of Yao County.</p>
<p>These days the blockhouse line is tense. When I arrived, I didn't hear any gunfire, but the commissioner and county magistrate shouted that it was terrible. Gu Zhutong, the commander-in-chief of the army, told them clearly when he came to Xi'an last time: "If you lose the county government, defend the office; if you lose the office, defend the desk." This is the responsibility of the county magistrate. The inspection at the city gate is particularly strict.</p>
<p>A broken county town, the streets are also covered with horse and mule droppings, to allow it to dry easily, because severe winter is about to descend. There is a mountain east of the city named "Mount Wutai" to adorn the faith of the people of Yao County. Even more beautifully decorated is the Medicine King Temple, with its gold and jade splendor. A large cart road leads directly to the county seat, and the incense burns year-round. Middle school students in the county seat kneel before the mud statues, shaking medicine containers, to seek prescriptions for someone in their family. Sun Simiao was undoubtedly a good doctor in the Tang Dynasty. According to the inscribed record in Lingjing, Emperor Taizong of Tang once visited Sun and asked him to serve as an official, but Sun still lived in seclusion here. He praised him, saying, "If he does not become one of the three dukes, he will surely become a famous doctor." He conferred upon him the title of "True Man." Sun wrote the "Essential Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold," and Guo Si, a scholar of the Song Dynasty Huiyou Pavilion, had it engraved in Huazhou to spread it widely. Later, another set was engraved in the Taoist temple. Now these stone steles are as complete as ever, because there are not many rubbings, and the inscriptions are clear, all of which are simple prescriptions. The "Overseas Formula" stele contains Sun's notes on his pillow and health preservation inscriptions, which are mostly in line with scientific principles. The main idea is quiet health preservation, revealing traces of the confluence of Confucian and Taoist thought. The backwardness of culture shows the strength of the power of gods and ghosts. The people of Yao County bring wine to the mountains to worship such temple gods, and their images shine. Myths circulate, while life is poor. If anyone were to try to close it down, they would undoubtedly be strongly opposed. Some people believe that it is better to be immersed in superstition than to be awakened. Moreover, they do not know when they will be saved again.</p>
<h3>Wheat Fields on the Loess Plateau: Public and Private Wastelands for Anyone to Cultivate</h3>
<p>The Xian-Tong branch line ends at Yao County. There are coal trucks from Yao County to the coal mine at Wulipu, five miles south of Tongguan, which also sell passenger tickets. From Wulipu to Tongguan Jin Suo Guan, you must hire a horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>On the loess plateau in this area, galloping on horseback, pulling on the reins, and looking at the boundless world, the rise of the northwest has been liberated from the labels of closed and backward since the development of the interior from the coast.</p>
<p>On the road north from Yao County to Jin Suo Guan, the wheat is green, but there is still so much wasteland. The government encourages land reclamation, but after a while, only the slogan remains: "Public and private wastelands, for anyone to cultivate." It is not very effective, because land reclamation requires capital and labor, and promoting a new movement requires organization. Over the years, the main theme of the county governments has been handling military service, maintaining the old methods of production. Tongguan County alone has built two hundred blockhouses, while the county's population is only 56,000. Yao County has only 50,000 people, Sanyuan has less than 100,000, and Yijun has less than 40,000, all of whom have a frightening burden.</p>
<p>A highway roughly follows the Qi River northward, with mountains on both sides. Where the loess has eroded, the Permian limestone layer is exposed, as well as conglomerate and shale. The wheat fields I saw were on both sides of the Qi River. Horses and mules run in the fields and eat the wheat, and no one thinks it strange, but people from the south would find it strange. At this time, farmers do not want it to rain or get warmer, otherwise the wheat will grow taller, and it will be difficult to have a good harvest next year, because the soil is loose and they are afraid that it will not be strong. They even need to flatten it, so these wheat plants are like piles of wild vegetables, flat and spread out in the field. At this time, they do not mind the trampling and grazing of sudden horses, as long as it grows firmly. There is a farmer's saying here: "Pigs in the first month, cats in the second month, women running all over the ground in the third month." In the first month, the crops have not yet sprouted, so pigs are allowed to run wild. In the second month, cats are in heat and do not stay home. In the third month, farm women pick wild vegetables everywhere. This is the case throughout the northern wheat belt.</p>
<p>All along the way, there were farmers driving mules. Some were transporting coal from the Jin Suo Guan area to Yao County, and some were carrying corn to the city to sell. But there were no mule carts, the only tool for travel, which shows that there was no travel. The ancient road was desolate. The horse I was riding was borrowed from the army, but it was not thin. Walking with these farmers, I felt that the men were thin and the warhorse was fat. They drove their mules, shouting loudly, or cursing intimately, with the whip cracking, making the ancient road a little less lonely. Their shouts were only short commands, mostly with one sound, occasionally with a retroflex sound. They said that there were more than a hundred commands for driving mules, which could not be recorded in writing or phonetic symbols. They could use commands to control the speed and direction, but when I learned their commands, I couldn't control the mules. They said, "The mules recognize the sound." The mules are all raised very fat. They say, "Four fish mixed with feed are better than bait." This saying means that as long as the grass is mixed evenly, the livestock will eat it all, without special bait.</p>
<p>They rely on pitiful agriculture, and the agricultural knowledge and life accumulated by the gods and ancestors. There are often many moving farming songs buried in the Chinese countryside, and this place is no exception. They sing of the weeds, saying, "Artemisia capillaris in the first month, artemisia annua in the second month, cut down and burned as firewood in the third month." They say that the tender grass in the first month is as fragrant as artemisia capillaris, and praise artemisia capillaris (a medicinal herb that can be soaked in wine). The grass is green in the second month, and the grass is lush after the third month, ready to be used as fuel. This is also the season when the ground is frozen and the grass is yellow. As I listened, I actually wrote down a large pile of proverbs. I felt that due to the difference in latitude, water conservancy, geology, and climate, their expectations for rain and early harvests, or their predictions of the weather, were significantly different from those in the south.</p>
<p>They have their own names for animals and plants. Male pigs and dogs are called "tooth pig" and "tooth dog," while females are called "grass pig" and "grass dog." Cats are called "lang cat" and "female cat." However, male horses are called "son horse," and female horses are called "mule horse." Male mules are called "son mule," and females are called "grass mule." Middle-aged pigs have a special name, they call them "Kalangzi." Crickets are called "vinegar spiders," and ants are called "butt floating horse." These are all local dialects. Artemisia capillaris is called wild flat bean, and Bupleurum chinense is called chicken tongue. They hate cuckoos, calling them "murdering robbers," because their calls are unpleasant and they have no good feelings for them. They do not know the elegant names given to this bird by scholars and poets.</p>
<p>Flocks of wild pigeons and wild chickens gather in the wheat fields, flying slowly and in large numbers. If there were hunting guns, there would be a harvest.</p>
<h3>Tongguan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Last year on Double Tenth Day, Tongguan County was renamed Tongchuan County. When people in Shaanxi talk about Tongguan, they specifically call it Northern Tongguan, because the pronunciation is the same as Tongguan. The telegraph bureau's Latin alphabet spelling encountered difficulties and often sent the telegrams of the two counties to the wrong place. But Tongguan Coal Mine is still Tongguan Coal Mine.</p>
<p>There is a severe coal shortage in Xi'an, but tens of thousands of tons of coal have accumulated in Yao County and Tongchuan, with mixed coal selling for four or five yuan per ton. The price in Xi'an is three times higher. Some employees on the Cheng-Tong branch line have given up their jobs waving red and green flags to traffic in coal, making a profit of three times their salary. I asked why the Longhai Railway could not transport the coal to Xi'an to alleviate the coal shortage this winter. The answer was that there were not enough cars. At present, the average daily output of Tongguan Mine is 650 tons, and the Longhai Railway's demand is 600 tons. That small difference is pulled out. However, of the investment in Tongguan Coal Mine, the Longhai Railway accounts for two-thirds and the provincial government accounts for one-third. According to the share capital calculation, the provincial government said that it should be given 200 tons. Coal merchants have great ability and can find ways to transport some coal out, because the interest on the Longhai Railway is disguised as selling carriages. Along the way, car inspectors, switchmen, and even staff members extort money. Everyone at the station has great power. A switchman said that if he doesn't throw the switch, the car won't start. Transportation is also full of difficulties. The Longhai Railway's fault is that coal prices in Xi'an are so absurdly high. Therefore, there are mule teams and hand-pushed carts transporting coal on the Xian-Yu highway. There are twenty-some private small mines in Tongguan County. These hawkers only choose large pieces because they are easy to transport. Small pieces or broken coal are piled up in the mine, and no one asks about them. The Longhai Railway has a Longhai Enterprise Company. The Japanese invaded Northeast China's South Manchuria Railway, with the railway as the center, developing enterprises and doing big business. People in Shaanxi asked what enterprises the Longhai Railway has. Running the road well is enough. I heard that they recently registered with the authorities.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Tongguan Coal Mine in Wulipu, the new and old mine directors were in the process of handing over the work. The mine director is determined by the council formed by the provincial government and the railway bureau. The new mine director, Ma Qingyuan, is an old member of the Tongmenghui. From the era of the Shaanxi Jingguo Army to the extension of the central government's power into Shaanxi, his army entered Xi'an and he served as the first garrison commander, and has always taken a firm attitude against Yang Hucheng. Before the victory, he was a consultant to the Military Affairs Commission. He retired this year and received a pension. "Without this pension, I wouldn't even be able to travel," this 54-year-old veteran said to me with a firm attitude. "Tongguan Coal Mine has made contributions during the War of Resistance, and it is the only large coal mine in the Northwest. We must take a long-term view and operate this mine from the standpoint of developing the Northwest." When it comes to coal quality, it cannot be compared with Guanyintang in Henan, let alone Jiaozuo. It contains 5% sulfur and is semi-anthracite coal. He said, "If transportation becomes smooth in the future and the output of other mines becomes more flexible, this mine will have problems." However, he believes that standing on the standpoint of developing the Northwest, we will never dislike opening another mine. "And we can find ways to reduce costs and make the selling price lower."</p>
<p>There are more than 6,000 workers in this mine. The average wage per worker is only about 1,600 yuan, and the monthly salary of an engineer is only about 200,000 yuan. The treatment is low and should be improved immediately. The Longhai Railway takes 600 tons of coal and only charges the cost plus 20% profit. However, the Longhai Railway delays payment and does not allow itself to sell coal. The Longhai Railway's losses are compensated by the coal mine. So he sighed and said to me, "I've only been here for eight days, and I don't know the internal situation very well. I always feel that this problem is very serious. There are many personnel problems. Now the first thing to do is to adjust the treatment. The shortcoming of state-owned enterprises is that there are too many office staff, and sometimes their treatment is higher than that of engineers. This is also an unreasonable phenomenon here. I have already told everyone that I am definitely not here to make money at the mine. If I take improper wealth, please report me."</p>
<p>Currently, there are four plants, twelve shafts, and several abandoned shafts. Three shafts are contracted to merchants, and about seven are in operation. The power is a few abandoned locomotives. The materials and machines are pieced together during the war. If we increase equipment, it is impossible to do so. If it is done, the output will naturally increase, but the transportation problem cannot be solved, so there is still no talk of development. The workers all live in cave dwellings, which are warm. There are mosquitoes in December. The hospital at the mine has a record of diagnosing 7,800 cases of malaria and other infections last year. This means that on average, everyone has seen a doctor once. The second most common is eye disease, followed by respiratory diseases. There are thousands of diagnoses for each.</p>
<p>The area of the mining area is more than 2,600 hectares, and the estimated reserves are 50 million tons. The entire Tongguan coal deposit belongs to the Carboniferous-Permian coal-bearing system. The large anticline limestone that runs from east to west divides it into northern and southern regions. After prospecting, the coal wells mined by local methods have penetrated the coal-bearing system and reached the limestone. Observing with columnar section diagrams, the northern coal seam dips northwest, high in the east and low in the west, low in the south and high in the north. The average thickness can reach four meters, with a total area of 44.7 million square meters. Taking the specific gravity as 1.3, the total reserves are 284.44 million metric tons. If only half of it is minable, then at a daily output of 4,000 metric tons, it can be mined for a hundred years. However, at present, including more than 20 private small mines, the daily output is only 1,200 metric tons.</p>
<p>I ran to the No. 1 well, which is more than 60 meters deep. There is no methane, and oil lamps can be lit. This well is mined using the room-and-pillar method. The mining slots have developed an area of 700-800 mu. Water is drained in the natural pores of the limestone. The Tongguan rock layer has more soft shale and less hard shale, so only the room-and-pillar method can be used. The miners wear thick cloth on their heads, with oil lamps tied to their foreheads, flames dancing. They push carts or drag coal baskets, crawling like earthworms. This is also life. They work eight or twelve hours, rotating shifts. The privately operated local method of mining requires workers to switch shifts every ten days and a month. During the shift change, they eat and sleep at the bottom of the well, without seeing the sun, truly underground workers.</p>

<h3>The Strategic Importance of a Mighty Pass: A Panoramic View Southwards Towards Chang'an</h3>
<p>From Tongguan to Huayin within the Guanzhong Basin, is what's known as the Jing and Wei plains. Its geography is similar to that between Beijing and Shanghai, yet its width is only tens of miles, and its area is only 40,000 square miles. (In my article "Guanzhong Covered with Frost and Snow," I described the irrigation projects of the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. Besides those, there are several canals that the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute assists in constructing: the Wugong Weihui Canal irrigates 2,000 acres; the Yunyang Yinhong Canal irrigates 20,000 acres. This canal uses dams to divert mountain floods for irrigation. The mountain floods bring with them a high concentration of phosphorus fertilizer. The Weinan Huohui Canal irrigates 20,000 acres, built using funds from the British China Relief Fund and will be completed this winter; the Fuping Fuhui Canal irrigates 20,000 acres, and will be able to release water next spring. These are the major irrigation projects in Shaanxi.) From Sanyuan to Yaoxian, after dozens of miles, you reach the edge of the plain. Climbing a mountain, I saw a vast plain. This is actually a loess plateau. Reaching Tongguan, you enter the mountains, and it becomes even higher at Yijun, forming the spine separating northern Shaanxi from Guanzhong. In Yijun, even in summer, one needs to wear a lined jacket. Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty once built the Yuhua Palace here as a summer retreat. North of Yijun towards Huangling and Luochuan, the terrain becomes lower again. The Jinshuo Pass, located between Yijun and Tongguan, stands majestically in the mountains like a natural barrier, becoming an important strategic point since ancient times, which is no accident.</p>
<p>The Guanzhong Plain is high in the west and low in the east, leaning against the Liupan Mountains in the northwest and separated by the Ziwu Ridge in the north. The northern Shaanxi region, north of Tongguan and Yijun, is also a basin, leaning against the Ziwu Ridge, high in the west and low in the east, covered with loess and red soil, making it a good wheat-growing area. Northern Shaanxi is isolated, and the people are poor, but the land is not barren, which is quite different from common perceptions. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, it has been abandoned to the Western Qiang people. Throughout history, whenever there were troubles in the west, it was always considered a strategic location for warfare. Zuo Zongtang pacified the Hui rebellion, and his subordinate Liu Songshan marched north from Xi'an to Suide. After the Republic of China was established, there was the so-called "banditry" in the region. Li Zicheng rose from northern Shaanxi, needless to say. Consequently, water conservancy was neglected, education was stagnant, the imperial court considered it a border area, and officials regarded it as a perilous route. Guanzhong and northern Shaanxi, though geographically close, felt like a thousand miles apart. Despite having fertile land, there was no development. This is the case for most of the Northwest, not just a corner of northern Shaanxi. Looking at the situation in the Jinghui Canal area after water conservancy was improved, and then riding a horse in front of the Jinshuo Pass, the barren mountains are severely eroded, with crisscrossing gullies. Hillsides that could be good farmland are now all wasteland. The court and public are engaged in lofty discussions and political debates, while conflicts continue. On the lines of blockhouses, opium is rampant. The further north you go, the cheaper it becomes. The decline of the people's livelihood is evident.</p>
<p>The terrain in the areas the reporter traveled through is extremely complex, making detailed surveying very difficult. The Ziwu Ridge meanders to Yijun and Tongguan. At first glance, it is all loess, but in the southeastern area of Tongguan, there is a large area of exposed red soil, which is likely the famous Sanmen Series red soil. The loess layer originally covered the red soil and can be dozens of meters thick, indicating severe erosion. The reason why the He Plateau looks like hills from afar is due to erosion and fragmentation. Often, two plains are separated by a deep valley, making it impossible to pass through, requiring a long detour, and the valley floor becomes a road or wheat field. A few hours of heavy rain can create a gully. Although the loess is thousands of feet high and seems stable, the degree to which it can be eroded is highly concerning.</p>
<p>The county seat of Tongguan has only two thousand and some hundred residents. Traveling thirty miles north, you arrive at the Jinshuo Pass. Going west from the pass, it is only a dozen or twenty miles to Guanqian. The reporter originally planned to go north to Huangling, but the roads were often blocked at this time, and incidents frequently occurred. After a ten-day trip through seven counties, it was possible to get a glimpse of the local conditions, so I turned back to Xi'an. The Jinshuo Pass was built during the Song dynasty. During the Qing dynasty, for defense purposes, there was only one garrison officer stationed there, later changed to one sergeant, with twenty soldiers. Each soldier received silver for only eight months each year, at one tael per month, and five piculs of rice per year, supplied by the county. The locals can still talk about it, showing the difference in burdens between now and then. Now, the reporter rides a horse in front of the pass and sees only a stretch of the pass wall, descending along the mountain. Two mountains converge, and the rocky cliffs create a dangerous path. The old pass entrance has been widened into a highway heading north. The function of the "mighty pass" of the past has completely disappeared. Climbing the pass and looking around, the vastness stretches in all directions. Looking south, from a high vantage point, everything is visible. The remains of the border pass include former barracks and reclaimed land, with half-withered willows, resembling an old veteran with a gray beard, hoeing and farming at the foot of the mountain, gazing at the setting sun over the Southern Mountains.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Uses of Plasma</h3>
<p>— Yi Jianlong</p>
<p>Significant progress has been made in therapeutic drugs during the Second World War. This remarkable progress has provided a deeper level of protection for human health and lives. In terms of the order of progress, the first can be said to be the synthesis and evolution of mineral preparations; the second is the preservation and unlimited use of plasma; and the third is the invention and mass production of penicillin. People in the country clearly have a considerable understanding of the therapeutic value of the first and third, while the uses and methods of the second seem to be only partially understood, and even abandoned altogether due to improper use. In the early years of the War of Resistance, the author studied blood transfusion therapy with experts in the United States and Canada, and later presided over a blood bank in Kunming for many years. Based on research and experience, I will give a brief introduction.</p>
<p>(1) Composition—To know the uses of plasma, one must first understand its effective components. Plasma is made from unclotted blood and is a mixture of colloidal and crystalline substances. Its effective components can be described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Essential Nutrients—All nutrients that have been digested by the gastrointestinal tract must be absorbed and transported through the plasma before they can reach the tissues of various parts of the human body. Furthermore, the remaining or stored nutrients in the tissues must also be absorbed and transported through the plasma before they can enter nutrient-poor tissues. From this perspective, plasma is nothing less than a general hub for nutrients. All nutrients needed by the human body, such as proteins, amino acids, fats, fatty acids, glucose, vitamins, and inorganic salts, are readily available.</p>
<p>(B) Substances Maintaining Osmotic Pressure—The circulating blood volume in a healthy human body is constant, accounting for 9% of body mass. Its ability to remain constant depends largely on the osmotic pressure within the plasma. This osmotic pressure can prevent the exudation of fluid from blood vessels, and can also return what has already exuded back into the blood vessels. There are two substances in the blood that maintain osmotic pressure: proteins and salts.</p>
<p>(C) Endocrine Hormones—Endocrine hormones are the mechanisms that constantly regulate changes in various parts of the human body. For example, thyroid and growth hormones control development, insulin controls carbohydrate metabolism, and ovarian hormones control fertility. These endocrine hormones originate in endocrine glands and are transported to various organs through the blood. Therefore, endocrine hormones are also present in plasma.</p>
<p>(D) Various Enzymes—Metabolism and detoxification in the human body are mostly mediated by enzymes. The plasma contains a variety of enzymes, the most important of which is thrombin.</p>
<p>(E) Various Antibodies—When the human body is invaded by bacteria, it produces antibodies that circulate in the plasma to fight the bacteria. The types and amounts of antibodies in the blood vary from person to person. In most mixed plasma, the types and amounts of antibodies are generally higher.</p>
<p>(F) Other Life-sustaining Factors of Unknown Origin.</p>
<p>(2) Uses and Methods—Knowing the effective components of plasma allows us to infer its uses. The uses and methods of plasma can be described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Traumatic and Surgical Shock</p>
<p>The etiology of shock is still under debate, but its significant pathological change, the escape of plasma from blood vessels, is generally recognized. Due to the action of certain malignant factors, the blood vessels dilate and permeability increases, causing plasma to escape into the surrounding tissues. As a result, the circulating blood volume is greatly reduced, and the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues is insufficient. If not treated immediately, the patient will likely die within nine to twelve hours. The effective method for treating shock is the rapid infusion of plasma. American shock expert Dr. Scudder said, "If blood is not transfused when it should be, death is imminent; insufficient blood transfusion is a waste of effort." Blood specific gravity, hematocrit, and blood pressure are the three standards for determining the timing and quantity of blood transfusion. If the blood specific gravity and hematocrit are higher than normal, while the blood pressure drops to below 70%, it is clear evidence that the blood is too concentrated and the heart's pumping volume is greatly reduced, and a large amount of plasma should be infused immediately until all three return to normal. The expressions of shock patients in our country are often not as obvious as those of Caucasians. Even when facing life-threatening situations, they remain calm, so laboratory tests and diagnosis are very important. If the patient can still eat and has no symptoms of dehydration, concentrated plasma or concentrated serum albumin can be injected intravenously to increase the osmotic pressure within the blood vessels, so that the plasma that has permeated into the surrounding tissues returns to the blood vessels. To prevent the occurrence of surgical shock, it is best to infuse 300 to 500 cc of plasma before and after major surgery. This procedure has become an indispensable routine in operating rooms of major hospitals in the United States.</p>
<p>(B) Hemorrhagic Shock</p>
<p>Bleeding from internal and external injuries can cause shock, but massive hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, ectopic pregnancy bleeding, and metrorrhagia can also cause severe shock. The difference between this type of shock and the shock mentioned above is that blood specific gravity, hematocrit, and blood pressure all decrease simultaneously. In this situation, plasma should be infused rapidly through multiple veins simultaneously to help the patient survive the critical period, followed by the infusion of whole blood or red blood cells. If the circulating blood volume is lost by more than one-third, it can be life-threatening, while the loss of red blood cells, if it does not exceed 60%, can still maintain its minimum level of gas exchange.</p>
<p>(C) Burns or Scalds</p>
<p>Severe burns or scalds can cause shock. Therefore, in addition to local treatment, plasma should be infused to prevent shock. Even after the shock has passed, plasma continues to leak from the affected area. According to Dr. Scudder's estimate, if a third-degree burn covers one-third of the body's surface area, the amount of plasma lost from the affected area in 24 hours is more than 4000 cc. To maintain the patient's normal blood volume, plasma infusion is essential. If the patient can still drink, concentrated plasma should be used.</p>
<p>(D) Secondary Anemia</p>
<p>The treatment for this type of anemia is to eliminate its source and promote the production of red blood cells. To promote the production of red blood cells, it is necessary to supply as much of the raw materials for red blood cell production as possible, including proteins and iron. Plasma contains sufficient protein and other nutrients, which can supply some of the raw materials for red blood cell production, so it can be an adjunct to iron therapy.</p>
<p>(E) Malnutrition</p>
<p>In severe malnutrition, the protein in the blood is lower than normal. As a result, water continues to permeate from the blood into the surrounding tissues, forming systemic edema. For this type of patient, only by measuring the protein in the blood and continuously injecting concentrated plasma can the patient recover quickly.</p>
<p>(F) Protein Deficiency Syndrome</p>
<p>Protein deficiency syndrome is caused by fatty changes in the renal tubules. In these patients, blood protein is continuously excreted from the kidneys. As a result, the protein in the blood is significantly reduced, and systemic edema can also form. These patients should also be treated with plasma. If the daily excretion of protein is more than 25 grams, and the patient cannot consume more protein, then 400 cc of plasma should be infused daily, since the protein content in plasma is usually around 7%.</p>
<p>(G) Febrile Diseases</p>
<p>In patients with diseases such as typhoid fever, typhus, and tuberculosis, gastrointestinal digestion and absorption are abnormal, and the body's consumption is high, resulting in a negative nitrogen balance. This pathological change not only reduces the patient's resistance but can also cause adverse complications. If plasma is continuously injected in addition to drinking more fluids, it can increase the patient's nutrition and resistance.</p>
<p>(H) Gastrointestinal Diseases</p>
<p>Whether or not these patients have undergone surgical treatment, if they cannot consume more nutrients, their condition will inevitably deteriorate. The remedy is to continuously inject plasma to increase nutrition and promote the healing of the affected area. An immobile adult needs at least 50 grams of protein per day, which requires 700 cc of plasma. Healthy plasma contains 7 grams of protein per 100 cc.</p>
<p>(I) Acute Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>Mixed human plasma contains a variety of antibodies, so it is effective against measles, pertussis, chickenpox, scarlet fever, erysipelas, and adenitis. American pediatrician Dr. Bavenberg's experiments have proven that among 4,733 children who received measles prevention injections (20 to 40 cc of plasma injected intramuscularly per person), only six cases of primary measles were found, while among 11,280 children who did not receive measles prevention injections, 94 developed primary measles.</p>
<p>(J) Premature Infants</p>
<p>With the advancement of modern medicine, infants born less than six months after conception can also be kept alive. In addition to regulating the temperature of the incubator, providing oxygen, and special nutrition, small amounts of plasma can also be continuously injected.</p>
<p>(K) Increased Intracranial Pressure and Breast Lumps</p>
<p>For these patients, continuous injection of concentrated plasma or concentrated serum albumin while reducing fluid intake is much more effective than treatment with magnesium sulfate laxatives.</p>
<p>Although plasma has many uses, there are also contraindications. In cases of organ dysfunction, excessive blood pressure, congestive heart failure, or acute pulmonary edema, plasma infusion should be used with caution, and large amounts are especially not recommended.</p>
<p>(3) Methods for Distinguishing the Quality of Plasma—After the victory of the War of Resistance, surplus dry plasma from the US military also flowed into our country's market along with other surplus materials. The modern pharmacopeia does not yet have methods for distinguishing between good and bad products. However, it is inevitable that the quality of various products will vary. To facilitate identification, I will briefly describe the dry plasma identification method for users' reference:</p>
<p>(A) Color—Expired dry plasma is a light, amorphous powder that is always straw yellow. It should not be used if it is clotted or has a light green tint.</p>
<p>(B) Unexpired dry plasma should dissolve completely within one minute after adding distilled water.</p>
<p>(C) Solution Turbidity—Turbidity is a common physical property of liquid plasma, but under an photoelectric colorimeter, its turbidity should not exceed 700 degrees.</p>
<p>(D) Residual Moisture—The residual moisture in dry plasma should not exceed 1.0%.</p>
<p>(E) No Pyrogens—Pyrogens are the corpses or waste products of bacteria. If the equipment used to prepare the plasma is not washed with special chemicals, or the soda water used to dissolve the dry plasma is not disinfected with a special filter, then a fever reaction is unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Protein Hydrolysates: Their Physiological Effects and Therapeutic Efficacy</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Xu Zhaodui, Recorded by Tao Shouqi</p>
<p>In-depth research on protein nutrition began more than forty years ago. At that time, famous scholars made contributions to the understanding of the protein content of food, the conversion rates of protein and nitrogen, the body's nitrogen balance, and the biological value of proteins. Later research also clarified the analysis of amino acids, the identification of essential amino acids, the relationship between proteins and edema, and so on. However, previous work was largely scattered and unsystematic. Chittenden's research concluded that the human body's need for and tolerance of protein was quite low, which had a somewhat dangerous impact, because the general public was under the impression that the protein needed by the human body was very easy to meet. At that time, research on vitamins was developing rapidly and soon showed its importance. As a result, general clinicians today only pay attention to vitamins and often neglect the importance of proteins. It was not until recently, due to the application of novel and rapid protein detection methods, and the mass production and therapeutic development of protein hydrolysates, that the topic of protein nutrition has once again aroused the interest and attention of the medical community.</p>
<p>Main Functions of Proteins The main functions of proteins in the human body are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Maintaining Blood Volume—The urgent function of proteins The proteins in plasma are a colloidal substance, so they can produce an effective osmotic pressure to resist capillary blood pressure, preventing excessive leakage of fluid from the blood vessels, and maintaining blood volume. Any injury is often accompanied by the exudation of plasma proteins in addition to bleeding, which reduces the osmotic pressure of the blood and thus aggravates the reduction of blood volume.</p>
<p>(2) Maintaining the Integrity of Tissues The results of research on bedsores have shown the importance of proteins for tissue integrity. Patients with bedsores have low protein levels in the blood and a negative nitrogen balance. If their protein intake can be increased, causing the nitrogen balance to become positive, then the bedsores will also heal, because tissues lacking protein nutrition have reduced vitality and are prone to collapse.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting Wound Healing A lack of protein affects the growth of fibrous tissue, making it difficult for any wound to contract. Postoperative wounds often tend to rupture when the protein in the plasma is too low. If protein intake can be increased, the wound will heal quickly.</p>
<p>(4) Promoting the Production of Immune Bodies, Endocrine Hormones, and Enzymes The existence of this function is only a hypothesis and needs to be clearly confirmed before it can be established.</p>
<p>(5) Functions During Recovery The protein metabolism during the recovery period from illness often undergoes significant changes due to the following factors: A. Patients who experience loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting during illness may reduce their protein intake. B. The diet in hospitals often contains too little protein due to economic or other difficulties. C. Patients with gastrointestinal disorders have poor protein absorption. D. The impact of exudation—Any loss of fluid from the body is accompanied by a loss of protein, especially the fluid exuded from burned surfaces or large abscesses, which contains a particularly high mass of proteins. Therefore, patients with large-area burns or empyema often lose no less than fifty to sixty grams of protein per day. E. The amount of protein excreted in the urine during illness or injury is often several times higher than normal. From the above five points, it can be seen that the human body during illness or injury is often deprived of large amounts of protein. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement protein during the recovery period.</p>
<p>Highly Nutritious Therapy The daily nitrogen content in a typical natural diet is about 10 grams, while in a high-protein diet it is 20 grams. Therefore, if the need for protein increases to a considerable extent in a diseased state, it is by no means something that a natural diet can cope with, and amino acids or protein hydrolysates must be given. When the need for protein intake exceeds the amount that natural food can supply, it is called hyperalimentation.</p>
<p>Application of Protein Hydrolysates Pure amino acid mixtures (Translator's note: Amino acids are the final product that protein becomes when it is digested or broken down, and they are absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Their relationship to protein is like glucose's relationship to carbohydrates) are difficult to manufacture and expensive, so protein hydrolysates are more suitable. Protein hydrolysates can be manufactured from milk, meat, fish, soybeans, brewer's yeast, or other protein-containing foods. The application of protein hydrolysates has the following advantages: (1) It does not require digestion. (2) The volume is small. (3) It can be taken as a medicine, unaffected by appetite. (4) It avoids conflicts with hospital authorities who want to save on patients' food expenses. Its main disadvantages are: (1) The taste is not good. (2) It can cause diarrhea when taken in large amounts.</p>
<p>Therapeutic Uses of Protein Hydrolysates</p>
<p>(1) Peptic Ulcers The hyperalimentation therapy for peptic ulcers has already been discussed by Dr. Xue Bangqi in a previous article in this column, so there is no need to repeat it here.</p>
<p>(2) Malnutrition In patients with malnutrition, treatment with hyperalimentation therapy can cause edema to subside and blood protein and red blood cell levels to return to normal within four to five days.</p>
<p>(3) Pulmonary Tuberculosis The combined use of hyperalimentation therapy and other treatments for pulmonary tuberculosis can accelerate the improvement of the condition.</p>
<p>(4) Postoperative Care The use of hyperalimentation therapy after surgery, especially gastrointestinal surgery, can promote the patient's nutrition and shorten their recovery period.</p>

<h3>Latest Vitamins</h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Although folic acid has been discovered for many years, its chemical structure was only elucidated and its artificial synthesis successfully achieved most recently.</p>
<p>Chemically speaking, folic acid is composed of the following three different chemical groups: pterin, p-aminobenzoic acid, and glutamic acid. Pterin is a type of yellow pigment found in butterfly wings; folic acid is also a yellow crystal.</p>
<p>Folic acid was originally a component of the vitamin B complex, initially called the "Lactobacillus casei factor" because it is an essential nutrient for the growth of *Lactobacillus casei*. Recent reports indicate that folic acid is also an essential element for human hematopoiesis and has specific effects on various megaloblastic anemias, similar to liver extracts. However, liver extracts are difficult to purify, and their determination requires clinical cases of pernicious anemia, resulting in high prices and inconvenient application. Folic acid is an artificial synthetic product that does not require biological determination. With mass production in the future, the price will inevitably be low, and the day when it completely replaces liver extracts is not far off.</p>
<p>As early as 1935, Day et al. reported that natural folic acid (initially called Vitamin M) had the effect of preventing a nutritional anemia in white mice. However, the therapeutic effect of this artificial synthetic product on human megaloblastic anemia was not discovered until 1945 by the American vitamin expert Spies et al. Spies et al. tested it on several cases of nutritional megaloblastic anemia common in the southern United States and obtained the same therapeutic effect as liver extracts, namely a rapid increase in the number of reticulocytes in the blood, followed by a steady rise in the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin levels. This year, it was also tested on Sprue, megaloblastic anemia during pregnancy, and true pernicious anemia, all with similar success. These results have been fully confirmed by Darby, Moore et al., and Zuclzer &amp; Cgden et al. in the same country. Recently, Wilkinson et al. in the United Kingdom used folic acid in five cases of pernicious anemia and also obtained equally satisfactory results.</p>
<p>However, folic acid is not the active ingredient (antianemic factor) in liver extracts. Folic acid is a bright orange-yellow crystal, while the most refined liver extracts are colorless. Willmson believed that folic acid might stimulate the production of blood factors in the liver. However, according to the experimental report published in the October issue of the Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology last year by Jacobson &amp; William in the United Kingdom, the antianemic factor in the liver and folic acid may belong to the same class of compounds, and their main chemical group is pterin. According to the research of these two scholars, synthetic xanthopterin and leucopterin, as well as liver extracts, can all produce the same reticulocyte response in splenectomized rabbits, while other substances such as iron and various vitamins (unfortunately, folic acid was not tested) do not have this effect. Therefore, they believe that the liver antianemic factor may be a pterin derivative.</p>
<h3>World Health Organization (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>1.  A New Definition of Health: The preamble to the organization's constitution first sets forth the most progressive and broad definition of health, considering health to be a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. It also recognizes that the highest attainable standard of health is a fundamental right of every human being, regardless of race, religion, political belief, economic, or social status. Furthermore, it believes that governments have an inescapable responsibility to protect the health of their people. Readers, consider: What is the view of the Chinese people regarding the meaning of health? How many people enjoy this fundamental right? Has the government fulfilled its responsibility to protect the health of the people?</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the Function of Hygiene: They all believe that scientific hygiene studies can greatly contribute to peaceful coexistence among human beings in this turbulent world. They firmly believe that sanitary facilities will raise the living standards of the people and promote the economic prosperity of society, thus assisting in the accomplishment of our common goal—world peace. They all believe that only a healthy and well-nourished people can truly understand the true meaning of basic freedom. They also believe that public health is the active and comprehensive crystallization of many scientific principles. In many advanced countries, thanks to sanitary facilities, the average lifespan of the people has doubled compared to the previous century. However, the development situation in various countries is very uneven. In some countries, hardly half of the children born can live to the age of five, and the average lifespan of their people is only half that of the people in more developed countries. They also believe that to achieve the great purpose of the World Health Organization, we need the greatest and most sustained efforts of our hygiene medical personnel. However, our efforts alone will not be enough. We must mobilize all of humanity so that they can understand the principles of hygiene and fight together. Readers, consider: How many of our people understand the true meaning of basic freedom? What is the average lifespan of our people? Only heaven knows, perhaps only half that of the United States and Britain. To what extent are our hygiene medical personnel working hard? To what extent are the people mobilized?</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the Impact of Unhygienic Conditions: They all believe that in the field of hygiene, countries are interdependent and interconnected. Epidemics in any region can endanger other countries. Low standards of health among the people not only hinder the economic prosperity of their own country but also affect the overall prosperity of the entire world. Readers, consider: What is the impact on our country and the world of the annual epidemics of smallpox, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, relapsing fever, measles, kala-azar, plague, hookworm disease, schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, and so on?</p>
<p>4.  Regarding the Future Mission of the World Health Organization: In the future, all previously established international health organizations will be merged into this new World Health Organization. It will use all the latest scientific knowledge and equipment to conquer diseases and plagues. Therefore, epidemic prevention remains the primary task. However, this is only the first step. One must know how many people in the world are struggling below the starvation line! Therefore, using our nutritional knowledge to cooperate with efforts in agriculture and food production to achieve freedom from hunger is also one of the goals. The second step is to positively and actively promote physical and mental health to achieve a higher level of physical development, a longer lifespan, more effective productivity, and a more meaningful life.</p>
<p>However, if humans cannot coexist peacefully and there is another major war, then everything will be destroyed together, and hygiene will be in vain. We should know that science can be used for good or for evil. The key lies not in the scientists themselves, but in the awareness and conscience of the broad masses of people to determine the good or bad fortune, life or death of human destiny. From the standpoint of striving for world peace, the World Health Organization seems to be a gathering point for uniting people from all over the world, a place for friendship among people with different cultures and beliefs, and may perhaps become a stepping stone for a world peace organization. I cannot help but offer my sincere wishes!</p>
<h3>Peptic Ulcers Diagnosed by X-rays</h3>
<p>— Chen Youxin</p>
<p>There are two significant differences between X-ray examinations of the stomach and X-ray examinations of the lungs. The first is the difference in tissue structure. The lungs can naturally show their outline under X-rays without relying on an additional medium. This natural revelation is impossible for the stomach, so a special medicine is usually needed to fill its interior to be examined. This medicine is either pure barium sulfate or barium sulfate synthesized with other non-essential ingredients. Taking this medicine alone has a limewater-like appearance and a soil-like taste. This medicine is very good; it does not cause any chemical reactions in the gastrointestinal tract, does not interfere with the work of the gastrointestinal tract, does not cause any side effects, and is not toxic, but it can help with the examination. The second difference is that the work of the stomach is intermittent, while the work of the lungs is continuous. In this way, the examination of the stomach needs a starting point and an ending point. The starting point is to start the examination when the stomach is empty, and the ending point is when there is no residue of barium in the stomach. Between these two points, the examination can be adjusted according to the actual situation. From this point of view, the stomach examination is more complicated compared to the lung examination.</p>
<p>The method of examining the stomach is equally important for fluoroscopy and radiography. In terms of the diagnostic value itself, fluoroscopy is more important than radiography. During fluoroscopy, the position of the stomach can be freely changed, any part can be palpated, any suspicious area can be observed in detail, the tenderness can be measured, the softness or stiffness of the stomach wall, adhesion or protrusion, or the hyperactivity or decline of stomach function, the freedom or discontinuity of peristalsis, and the muscle contraction or relaxation of the pylorus or any part can all be obtained with a correct concept. Of course, the shadows of the lesion itself can also be revealed on the fluoroscopic screen at the same time. However, radiography also has special effects. This is not only a record of the shadow that can be used for later reference or as a blueprint for consultation, but it can also provide information that was missed or not clearly displayed during fluoroscopy.</p>
<p>If the above methods cannot be summarized into an accurate diagnosis, then there are several special examination methods that can be used. I will skip over them briefly for now. There is also a situation where the symptoms of the stomach occur as a result of diseases in other parts or systems. For example, many so-called indigestion or stomach pain are caused by diseases of the cecum. There are also so-called true stomach wall erosions that are caused by brain problems. But even for diseases of the stomach itself, X-ray examination cannot necessarily lead to a definite conclusion. However, most of the failures are mostly due to the mildness of the disease and the short duration of the illness. There are also cases where the presence of many secondary signs buries the main signs of the disease during X-ray examination. Therefore, in many cases, the results of X-ray examination can only be regarded as a clinical reference, like other laboratory methods, and cannot be regarded as a diagnosis. However, if the result is very clear, or if the examiner is very experienced and confident, then this is equivalent to a perfect and independent diagnosis.</p>
<p>Some people also suspect whether the amount of X-rays received during a stomach examination will have any harm to the body? This answer can be negated based on modern knowledge. The amount of X-rays that commonly causes at least a minimal biological change is difficult to exceed in a thorough stomach examination, which means that this kind of consideration is superfluous under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about why patients with peptic ulcers need X-ray examinations. First, of course, to check if an ulcer exists. If it is confirmed, then its location, size, depth, and number need to be clarified. Secondly, it is necessary to measure its connection with stomach function, digestive obstruction, pyloric obstruction, stomach wall adhesion, or anything else. Second, to distinguish whether this ulcer belongs to the ordinary category or the so-called malignant category. Third, it is about the selection of treatment methods. Even during the treatment process of the ulcer, X-ray re-examination is also necessary. Determining the effectiveness of the treatment, this kind of re-examination is very helpful. Furthermore, after using surgical operations, the examination of the stomach not only provides powerful reference in clinical methods, but can also take timely measures to prevent the recurrence of ulcers.</p>
<p>Regarding the X-ray signs of ulcers, the most definitive and valuable is the "niche" sign. The "niche" shadow is an organ with a disease that has a small protruding area on its outline. This is the shadow caused by the ulcer itself being filled with the medicine. The location of this "niche" is mostly on the upper edge of the stomach or at the tip of the duodenum that directly communicates with the stomach, occasionally on the pylorus or the lower end of the esophagus. Although stomach ulcers themselves are far fewer in number than duodenal ulcers, the "niche" itself is relatively easy to find in the stomach. However, it is not easy for every ulcer patient to show this important sign, so sometimes it is necessary to rely on other signs to confirm the diagnosis. I will omit the details for now.</p>
<p>Now I will talk about when a stomach examination cannot be performed. Sometimes, a stomach examination is inappropriate or should be delayed. For example, after stomach bleeding, palpation during the examination may cause renewed bleeding. There are also times when the ulcer is about to perforate, then the surgery during the examination may also cause adverse consequences.</p>

<h3>Journey on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>— Gan Xiao</p>
<p>The twentieth century should be the era of "man conquering nature," but in many, many places in our daily lives, we are always "calling out to heaven in desperation."</p>
<p>This time, I came from Hankou, from river to river, which was originally a very smooth waterway, but I called out to heaven several times; and even after arriving home safely, I still felt like an old woman from the countryside, feeling "blessed by heaven."</p>
<p>Buying a boat ticket with money is the simplest thing, but I still called out to heaven. On the day I arrived in Hankou, several boats were docked along the riverbank, and goods and passengers had already been unloaded completely. However, the larger ones belonged to the state-owned China Merchants Bureau and had already been assigned as "official boats." The smaller boats belonged to private companies, and the official ticket sales time only lasted for a few fleeting minutes, so one had to go to the black market. And a friend working at the shipping company listed a large number of unstable aspects of black market tickets, which made me, a law-abiding citizen, have to cautiously retreat. "An honest person doesn't do shady things," I followed my friend's advice and waited for a "official market" ticket to arrive. As a result, I waited and waited, and the rats and bedbugs in the warehouse attacked wantonly. I was so anxious that my hair turned white, and I firmly advocated sacrificing to the "black market" to eat. Only then did I buy a third-class "fixed cabin" ticket (with a bunk) at one and a half times the price. First and second-class tickets had naturally been given to the "black market".</p>
<p>The boat I was on couldn't be considered young: it was fifty-three years old! Stepping onto the deck, the soles of my feet were sticky, indicating that it was well-worn and weathered, not a tender, white-skinned beginner. It was said to weigh about five hundred tons, and it loaded three or four hundred tons of goods and four or five hundred passengers in Hankou; most of the passengers were demobilized military and government personnel, surrounded by boxes and miscellaneous items, so the boat was quite full. There were not many first and second-class passengers, most of them were third-class "fixed cabin" and fourth-class "open cabin." How could people not call out to heaven when all these people had to be crammed into this fish gut!</p>
<p>The "fixed cabin" bunks were divided into upper and lower layers, and mine was on the lower layer. I turned sideways to open the quilt and spread it out, and put a few small luggage items at my feet. In order to reduce crowding, I took off my leather shoes and burrowed into the quilt. Then a series of noises came, mostly about the excessive luggage of the passengers, and the steward tried his best to stop them. What was the use of the stewards? They didn't have grass-green uniforms and collar badges; as a result, the "fixed cabin" became a disguised luggage room, and all the air vents and passageways were blocked by luggage. And the most wonderful thing was my "head people": there were a total of eleven of them, and they only bought four upper bunks; two bunks were prepared for people to sit on; and two bunks were prepared to place those twenty-five or six pieces of luggage! When they put down six bayonet-mounted rifles, the stewards all shut their mouths and stood far away, and the luggage was moved in piece by piece. I was lying on my back looking up and could see very clearly: the luggage bunk was gradually tilting, and the only crossbar was gradually bending. I knew that the two female passengers sleeping in the lower bunks were in extreme danger, and I couldn't help but stand up and protest. I said:</p>
<p>"This is not a luggage room. If everyone puts luggage in like this, the air will be completely squeezed out. And putting these luggage items on these thin boards will cause the upper bunk to collapse and kill people. Who will take responsibility?"</p>
<p>Hey! Their leader stood out conspicuously, patted his chest: "I'll take responsibility, I'm a brigade commander!" He pointed to his major general collar badge. Oh! Brigade commander! I thought to myself: "The brigade commander fell from the sky, what does he care about killing people or not killing people?" In the midst of thinking this, the crossbar really broke. If there weren't also boxes and baskets on the lower female passengers' bunks, those two women would have had to test the brigade commander's "responsibility." I don't know how, I heavily tapped that brigadier's shoulder, without saying a word, just pressed the flashlight to show him the broken crossbar. His arrogance was a little lower at this time, and he directed his soldiers: "Move the luggage down! There's going to be a death case!" So all his luggage was stuffed in the passageway, and the four bunks only slept eleven people, so we "lower people" were spared from the disaster of being crushed to death, and we had to thank heaven and earth!</p>
<p>The next morning, it was time to go to the women's restroom: walk along the stern to the kitchen, walk down the steps from the kitchen, pass through the open-cabin bunks, and turn right. Open that short door, and the situation inside was unbearable to look at: it was obvious that excrement and urine were flowing straight down; there was no room to stand. Good heavens, the "black slave ships" of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries must have been like this!</p>
<p>Climbing up the handrail, a pile of people squatted down and blocked the way. Looking down, they were all holding rice with both hands on the floor. One pile of rice was knocked over, and the white rice was mixed with the black paste that stained the bottom of the feet, like the sesame filling of pig lard glutinous rice balls; good heavens! This is what they were preparing for the third and fourth-class passengers to eat!</p>
<p>I wanted to go to the deck for a breath of fresh air, but this boat had no deck at all. Looking at it, it was all piles of firewood like mountains! The "open cabin" friends were all learning Goujian's lying on firewood, using the firewood as bunks. Besides the firewood, there were dozens and hundreds of baskets of eggs, duck eggs, salted fish, and cured meat. I asked an old steward and learned that these were the private goods of the boat's accountants and stewards. I asked him why he could bring so many private goods? He frowned and smiled bitterly and said: "What else can we do if we don't bring them? There are a total of thirty-five stewards, and none of us have a big money salary. The boat only provides a mouthful of white rice, and everyone at home has children and wives. Now most of the passengers are soldiers, and we can't get tea money by soliciting tips. What else can we do if we don't bring private goods? Now it's concealing from the top but not from the bottom. Besides the company's big boss, the boat's accountants are all in the same boat. The accountants have salaries, and they can also sell bunks on the boat; but the private goods they bring are even more than ours." I couldn't estimate how much their private goods weighed, but when I poked my head out and looked down, the calm river water was almost level with the ship's side, and a small wave could hit the porthole. This old small boat was really in danger.</p>
<p>The teacher taught people "not to stand under a dangerous wall." We are now loaded on a dangerous boat, surrounded by the vast river, what other way to be at ease other than secretly calling out to heaven?</p>
<p>After passing Datong, it suddenly anchored in the middle of the night, and everyone asked the steward one after another. The old steward explained; "There's fog! Fog is falling from the sky. The boat's salary is low; the pilot is an inexperienced greenhorn. This is called blind eyes not minding clubfoot, and clubfoot not minding blind eyes, so they just accommodate each other. At this time, it's good to be careful and stop." Good heavens, anchoring is good! Otherwise, we would have sacrificed to their "blindness" and "clubfoot"!</p>
<p>Approaching Jiangyin, it anchored again. The impatient passengers all jumped up. The old steward came to explain again: "Passengers, you are anxious, our pilot is more anxious than you, he has a celebration at home tomorrow night. There's no way! The boat is about to reach 'Anchor Sand,' it's getting dark, and the fog is heavy, how can we go? Other foreign ships have to be careful too. And say our 'old grandfather ship'! A few passengers asked him: "What is 'Anchor Sand'?" "Anchor Sand"? "Anchor Sand" is weird! It's a monster! In the middle of the night, it comes together, and the boat runs aground. When it dawns, the sand sinks down, and the boat is sucked down together. There used to be a French boat that ran aground in Dao Place, thinking it was okay, but it was sucked away by the monster at dawn. Only when the Japanese are here, the monsters are also afraid of them and never appear." Are monsters really afraid of the Japanese? I think there are more lighthouses!</p>
<p>It anchored for two hours, and the engine started wheezing again. The fog became heavier and heavier, and the riverbank was nowhere to be seen. The whistle sounded a long blast every two minutes, and the long blasts sounded like the dying wails of wild beasts, so disturbing! The old steward was complaining like a monologue: "Looking for death! Sailing in such fog! If we make it through, the pilot alone will be happy to be a new groom, if we don't make it through, five hundred people will be happy to see King Yama together!" Late at night, a dim oil lamp swayed, and the prone passengers looked like corpses, the steward's complaints and the wailing whistle intertwined, making people shudder, as if King Yama was waving.</p>
<p>Finally, it dawned, and the sun was about to break through the clouds and fog. Although the riverbank was still invisible, the whistle sounded less and less. After a few more hours, it finally brought us to the Huangpu River bank. When we stepped ashore, we were even more fortunate to be reborn, as if we had entered heaven.</p>
<p>The river is so dark and without sunlight, going on the river in the twentieth century, everyone still relies on heaven, who would want to be born in this time and place?</p>
<h3>"Fruit" Original Manuscript</h3>
<p>— Botticelli</p>
<p>Botticelli (Sandro Botticelli 1445-1510) can be considered an outstanding talent full of imagination in the Florentine school. Although he also painted several Madonna and Child pictures, he was a bold anti-Christian. His representative works include "Allegory of Spring" and "The Birth of Venus". The composition is especially clever and ingenious, the colors are fresh and the lines are beautiful. Although the subject matter belongs to fantasy, the faces are full of desire and have a "modern" feeling. The original manuscript of "Fruit" is one of them. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Winter Solstice Grass</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>It is the time when dreams return.</p>
<p>The cold wind outside the window howls.</p>
<p>The clamorous noises have quieted down, and the memories by the pillow turn again toward a sorrowful life. A clear blockage has formed in my heart.</p>
<p>I seem to hear your soft laughter:</p>
<p>"Your journey through life is gradually becoming dim and shrinking!"</p>
<p>Yes, it's been a year already, precisely today, the day when people at the Qiantang Riverhead were immersed in rare revelry. The warmth of peace and light unveiled our curtains, and we slowly walked across that long and peaceful lakeside embankment, as if traversing a period of suffering that had already distanced itself from us. There was the radiance of lights deep within the willow grove, and I saw the excitement and joy rising and falling in your chest:</p>
<p>"From now on, you should stumble forward vividly and stubbornly towards the journey you desire!"</p>
<p>"Quietly," my lips imprinted on your warm hairline, "I am thinking about those splendid and extravagant steps ahead!"</p>
<p>A corner of the small building conveyed melodious singing, the lake water was still silent, and the night mist drifted across our cheeks; we smiled at each other.</p>
<p>Can you say that was a distant dream?</p>
<p>In the third month of spring this year, I came to this city with you.</p>
<p>I heard people praising the blessings of this newborn city.</p>
<p>But I saw many things:</p>
<p>The people who came from the distant northern lands, apart from still harboring some warm memories of the hearth in the snowy sky, have they not all learned to extract tender vows along the edges of those busy, bustling canopies?</p>
<p>And also those who came to this city, huddled from the south, the longing and attachment to the azure seas and cloudless skies have already faded away, and in many corners that attract people to linger, are they not also composing melodies that make people feel lost, using the sound of joyful hearts?</p>
<p>Who understands lament? Who understands anger? Are we not all hastily and confusedly crafting things that mock our lives with our own hands?</p>
<p>Helplessly, I ran through every corner of this city again and again, and the accusations of the virtuous were suffocated to the point of near extinction! Harm to society exists everywhere! Oppression of humanity!</p>
<p>There is no story, no poems, just a page of lamentable blankness!</p>
<p>It was originally a bottomless turbid flow!</p>
<p>Gradually, I forgot how to sing loudly and shout wildly, and I slowly learned the worldly ways and pretenses of life; I accepted the society's praise and indulgence, and I also tasted the melancholy and sorrow of the human world. I have become a piece of flotsam floating in the turbid flow; flotsam will never, and cannot, cause ripples in the turbid flow!</p>
<p>The vivid and stubborn journey is no longer intimate, and a shameful emptiness remains in my heart.</p>
<p>This disappointment to you is inevitable.</p>
<p>However, I am already tired enough.</p>
<p>Yes, it has been a year, precisely today. The people in this city have not diminished their usual revelry, desolate songs are still overflowing, and emerald green cypress branches and ivy reflect the flames in the candle tears, all of which deeply evoke my nostalgia.</p>
<p>Let repentance wash away my year of idleness and procrastination! Even if this city inflicts cruelty and bitterness upon me, there is still next year, and there is still a precious period of time... I still have a soul that has not been infected by vulgarity and decadence!</p>
<p>I silently pondered beside the pillow, facing the candle. You should be able to imagine my feelings at this moment.</p>
<p>The clamorous human world will be restored again, right? The cold wind outside the window howls.</p>
<p>You should bless it, the future rebirth of this city!</p>
<p>It is the time when dreams return.</p>
<p>The eve of the Winter Solstice, Year 35.</p>
<h3>An Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 134</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Oh!" For the first time, Tsurumi felt real terror. "Then where did these numbers come from?"</p>
<p>"That was probably a year ago?"</p>
<p>"What?" Tsurumi thought he had misheard.</p>
<p>"You know we also have a set of machines. A year ago, we often received this kind of special code but didn't pay much attention. In the past year, we've heard more about it. Teacher Aoki spent some effort to crack the numbers... But you don't need to worry. So far, only he alone can decipher them, but it still takes a lot of effort. He doesn't want to publish it, and he doesn't want to do it much. He doesn't want to waste his energy. He says he still wants to live."</p>
<p>"Ah," Tsurumi heard this and felt a weight lifted from his shoulders. "Pingzi, I have one more thing to say. What I'm doing is so difficult. Since the old gentleman says someone else is also doing it, this is a virtuous act that saves countless lives. Why doesn't the old gentleman..."</p>
<p>"Why not find that thing?" Pingzi finished Tsurumi's sentence. "It's not that he doesn't want to find it, but he can't find the location where it's hidden."</p>
<p>"Why not use metaphysics?"</p>
<p>"Brother, you say you've also studied metaphysics. How can you say such unprofessional things?"</p>
<p>"Couldn't he perform the art on the person hiding it?"</p>
<p>"There's no medium."</p>
<p>"Aren't you a ready-made medium?"</p>
<p>"I have no feelings for that old fellow. How can I be a medium?" Pingzi was a little angry.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Tsurumi was disappointed. "Then, goodbye."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, brother. Definitely goodbye. At least three times; the last goodbye, I hear, will be very long!" Pingzi hung up the phone with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Tsurumi was preoccupied and didn't pay much attention to the meaning of Pingzi's "long time," nor did he want to argue with her any further. Although the evening's plan had been disturbed by this phone call, everyone felt that things had reached this stage, and it was like an arrow on the string, which had to be launched. Besides, they were somewhat skeptical of Pingzi's words.</p>
<p>At exactly nine o'clock in the evening, Tsurumi was already sitting upright in the military aircraft "Chang Sheng". There were seven or eight people traveling with him, all senior active-duty officers going to North China, except for Tsurumi. However, half an hour before the plane took off, the second supplemental edition of Tokyo's evening newspapers all carried a mysterious short message, titled "Challenge to Tsurumi Wang by a Mysterious Adversary," which read: "Tsurumi Tama-kun: I have long admired your good skills as a man. Now you are in a time of turmoil. The Prime Minister also favors you with a discerning eye; a meteoric rise is within reach. However, although my colleagues are of humble origins, we do not presume to be superior. We have something to suggest, presumptuously seeking a small price; swordsmanship, archery, grant us one or two skills, and it will be enough. Around eleven o'clock in the evening, 'Beppu' will be waiting sincerely. Bowing, the members of the Sino Society."</p>
<p>On that day, the evening newspapers all treated this matter as fresh material. After publishing this mysterious short message, the editors of each newspaper added a few thoughts: some said, "Why are they fighting each other?" Others said, "The style of the knights of the Edo fifteenth century is seen again today!" Still others said, "A chivalrous thief is challenging Sherlock Holmes; there is sure to be a good show to watch!" And some said, "Soldiers should serve the country loyally, and should do their best, not seek merit. Why be jealous? If you feel indignant, you should be upright and stand up and compare your strengths in front of the public, not rely on sneaky tricks," and so on.</p>
<p>On the plane, five or six out of the eight passengers had bought several copies of the second supplemental edition; although the newspapers were different, they all carried this short message, and it was explained that Tsurumi was on this "Wei Sheng" aircraft. Although the seven people did not know Tsurumi, they could certainly guess; because they were a group, and Tsurumi was alone.</p>
<h3>Homecoming Poetry</h3>
<p>— Pin Baihua</p>
<p>Awakening Wang Wei cannot paint it,</p>
<p>I should be able to boast that my birthplace has a "famous mountain". China is a country with many mountains, but a mountain must be clear and beautiful to be considered famous. So, Li Taibai, the immortal banished to earth over a thousand years ago, did not distort the line of poetry, "Loving famous mountains, I enter into the lands of Yue"; at the same time, he also dreamed of traveling to Mount Tianmu, the so-called "eighteen thousand feet" place of the banished immortal's dream journey is located to the east of my hometown. But things often turn out to be the opposite. Regarding the famous mountain of my birthplace, for more than ten years, feelings of cherishing have overshadowed elements of self-praise, because I have long become a "person of the east, west, north, and south", without the fortune of "riding a gentle steed, traveling in a low carriage, and being a virtuous person in my hometown".</p>
<p>However, I have finally returned. After passing "Qingfeng Ridge", the Yan Stream is like a smooth ribbon, circling around the towering peaks and white clouds, which are the outer garments of the mountain spirits! It floats so freely over one mountain peak after another. The lush trees screen a few white-walled houses, telling me that this is a natural embrace without the machinations of the city. I think that this not only attracts the poetic inspiration of the banished immortal, but it is also a very good painting, but so good that it is too natural. Unless Wang Mojie, whose "paintings have poetry", comes to create a "Yue Zhong Diagram", wouldn't it be better than the "Axis River Diagram" where "mountain valleys are dense and clouds fly and move"?</p>
<p>The small chartered car stopped in Sheng County. I knew that Zongen took advantage of the remaining time before changing cars to take a look at "Listening Pavilion," but it was just a mound of earth covered with weeds. In such a place, how many people can learn from Dai Andao by "having both oranges and a dou of wine"? Naturally, it was deep autumn, where could one find yellow orioles? We circled around the edge of the grassy area, and then we got on the bus to Xinchang. Shengxin is only forty miles apart, and the carriage was filled with the sounds of the local dialect, but after more than ten years of separation, even my local dialect has changed, not to mention the hair on my temples. Especially in a cloth gown, who would recognize you? So I huddled up, afraid to listen to the local dialect. Gradually, the ancient mountain city of my hometown came into view. I pulled Zongen and jumped out of the car, and we walked along the secluded road at the foot of the city, not wanting the "elders of Jiangdong" to discover this poor boy returning to his hometown as old as ever.</p>
<p>It was night, and my hometown had no electric lights. I remember that in the past, there was this gift from the city, but perhaps "restoration" is not easy! Thus, when night falls, the whole place is pitch black. In addition, seven or eight tenths of the streets and houses were destroyed in the calamity, leaving a field of rubble. Although we carried a "lantern" to walk, it was still very difficult to find the path. My three old houses had become "truly" dilapidated, with nothing inside. I temporarily lodged in the empty house of the Assembly.</p>
<p>For several days in a row, I was fortunate to have Zongen's help, so that eating was not a problem, because there were people inviting us to dinner every morning and evening. However, I was disgusted that the invitation cards actually had the words "Professor Lu" written after "Inspector Chen". In this small mountain city, where civil servants earn at most three or four hundred thousand yuan a month, and the county magistrate earns no more than one million, the pomp and entertainment were surprisingly urbanized.</p>
<p>A thousand stacks of emerald green bathe my lapel,</p>
<p>Awakening Wang Wei cannot paint it;</p>
<p>Returning in scholar's robes, no one recognizes me,</p>
<p>The carriage behind fears the prolonged sound of my hometown!</p>
<p>After ten years of barrenness, I seek the three paths,</p>
<p>Wood and stone are heartless and easily change masters;</p>
<p>I wish to sacrifice to the Dragon Mound as an unfilial son,</p>
<p>Stone pass trees planted of all kinds transform and grow.</p>
<p>A Brief History of Musicians</p>
<h3>Handel</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Handel, a great German musician, is as famous as Bach, another great musician from the same country. The difference between the two is: Bach lived a secluded life, devoting all his efforts to church music works, whose mood contained strictness in tranquility; Handel was famous throughout Europe, writing opera works with a soaring and fluent pen. However, Handel's place of effort was not Germany, but England. His more important works are considered to be in the "Oratorio". What is called "Oratorio" is similar in nature to opera, but it is not performed on stage, but sung and played by itself. Handel was born in 1683 and died in 1759.</p>
<h3>Bach</h3>
<p>Bach, a German, is considered the progenitor of modern Western music, and is as famous as Handel. Most of his works are church music, but they are often played in music as well. He wrote extensively throughout his life. Born in 1685, died in 1750.</p>

<h3>Mishap</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, three planes crashed in Shanghai one after another, killing and injuring more than seventy people. This tragedy occurred on this festive occasion, which is truly unfortunate!</p>
<p>The cause of the accident was due to the heavy fog, which made it impossible for the planes to identify the airport, resulting in the disaster. After inspecting the wreckage of the planes, there was no sign of fire or burning, which is sufficient to prove that each plane had circled over Shanghai for a long time, and the fuel had been exhausted, forcing them to make an emergency landing. On this day, only China Company's No. 147 aircraft was unexpectedly lucky, and was able to make a forced landing at Jiangwan Airport, suffering slight damage, and the personnel on board were fortunately unharmed.</p>
<p>Fatalists may exaggerate and say: life and death are predetermined. In fact, although this misfortune is said to be the unpredictable wind and clouds of heaven (heavy fog), attributable to changes in the climate, it can still be avoided by doing everything possible. We remember that when the China Clipper was test flying the Pacific route, it encountered a storm on the Pacific Ocean. If it were not for the perfect flight equipment, it would not have been able to complete this flight smoothly. Heavy fog is certainly a major obstacle to flight. If wireless radio is used to guide the direction, and if the ground guidance landing equipment (using light or sound) is perfect, how can heavy fog affect safety?</p>
<p>This year, the record of flight accidents is really not small. If this continues, it is inevitable that the general public will become wary of air travel. Should airline companies and transportation authorities carefully study this matter, and assess all equipment and various responsible personnel (including pilots, communications, and ground personnel) to prevent problems before they occur? Because human life is at stake, there must be no negligence. Seeking perfection is not only providing guarantees to passengers, but also making the greatest contribution to the future of China's aviation industry.</p>
<h3>Year-End Mutterings</h3>
<p>— Cishou</p>
<p>"Rising winds", "Hitting winds", "Seizing winds", "Overturning winds", "When the great wind rises, the people suffer!"</p>
<p>The 35th year of the Republic of China is about to pass. As we welcome the arrival of the 36th year, we might as well review this year. I think about it again and again, and I can't come up with a good term to give to this year. I might as well give it a "nickname" and call this year the "Year of Many Winds".</p>
<p>Although the weather has been cold recently, the winds outside have not been that strong. Why call it the "Year of Many Winds"? Am I stirring up trouble? Indeed, the meaning of "wind" is very broad; the winds I am talking about are neither the southeast wind nor the northwest wind, but rather the "rising winds", "hitting winds", "seizing winds", and "overturning winds" of this year.</p>
<p>First, the "rising winds". Whenever a rising wind sweeps over, people are as if in a daze, at a loss. When the rising wind has passed, they wake up and take a breath. But good times don't last long. The second rising wind intensifies and comes one after another, putting people back into a state of confusion. The small people live their lives in these endlessly cycling rising winds, and they really don't know when prices will stop rising.</p>
<p>Next, the "hitting winds". Whether you are in a theater or on a sports field, you can see this kind of wind, constantly being directed by someone. I don't know why human nature has become so irritable. People start fighting at the slightest disagreement, beating each other to a bloody pulp, all "as if nothing happened," happy to be watched by others.</p>
<p>Third is the "seizing winds". This year, it is difficult to solve the problem of livelihood, and there are not a few people who take risks, and the seizing winds are becoming more and more intense. But there are different kinds of seizing methods. "Robbers and bandits" rob openly, while corrupt officials and treacherous merchants rob secretly. Those who rob openly say that they are robbing because it is difficult to solve the problem of livelihood, but what are those who rob secretly doing it for? Robbing gold, robbing US dollars, robbing materials, robbing with pleasure. No matter what the robbing method is, privately lining one's pockets will not be as "inflated" as the currency. The more you rob, the more you spend, causing each other, and the robbing is endless!</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the "overturning winds". This seems to be the "grand finale". As the end of the year approaches, overturning winds are prevalent.</p>
<h3>Liu Jianxu, Chairman of Fujian</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>The current Chairman of Fujian Province, Liu Jianxu, graduated from the Third Term of the Baoding Military Academy as an infantry officer. After leaving the school, he served in various military posts, rising from platoon leader to group army commander and deputy commander of the Third War Zone. After the 17th year of the Republic of China, he was responsible for the pacification work on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi, repeatedly achieving the effect of destroying and clearing, which was highly praised by his superiors. During the Anti-Japanese War, he galloped on the southeastern battlefield. In the Battle of Hangzhou Bay, he captured Zhenhai, and the situation in Zhejiang Province was immediately turned from danger to safety. After that, he let Chen Yi become the chairman of Fujian Province, and the lost coastal areas were immediately recovered one by one. He has always adhered to the principle of "three points military, seven points politics" in his administration. The gradual stability of the situation in Fujian shows that his administration has indeed partially achieved results.</p>
<p>In mid-March of this year, Liu passed through Shanghai and hosted a banquet at the Jinmen Hotel for his fellow villagers from Fujian who lived in Shanghai. He himself is from Liling, Hunan, with a fat, round face, which particularly showed his full spirit.</p>
<p>Liu's first wife, Chen, had thirteen daughters and five sons, making up a neat number of ten children in the family.</p>
<p>He governs his family very strictly, does not allow his family members to wear strange clothes, and strongly hates gambling, and uses this as a transformation strategy to see his daughters.</p>
<p>Since the 25th year of the Republic of China, the people of Fujian have suffered from natural disasters, man-made disasters, and corruption and exploitation. Now they need to rest and recover, and the people all deeply hope that Chairman Liu will work hard to govern, stabilize the people's livelihood!</p>
<h3>Amidst the Flames of War, There is a Paradise</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The housing shortage that came with the victory still cannot be resolved even now, a serious problem. The authorities seem to have put some thought into it, and plans have been drawn up one after another, residential areas, people's villages, these are forever just talking on paper.</p>
<p>Recently, I was like "Columbus" discovering a new continent, and I saw a genuine "people's village". Where is it? The location is near "West Station" and "New Longhua". The residents here seem to be like those in "Peach Blossom Spring", living without contention with the world, working at sunrise and resting at sunset.</p>
<p>This place was originally wasteland, but now, shop owners complain of hardship, and factory owners sigh of poverty, saying that the end of the year is difficult to pass, and there is another hurdle after one hurdle. These days, they have a feeling of "every day is like a year", and every day is like "New Year's Eve". I think that if we don't fundamentally think about settling down and unifying, no matter what wise methods you come up with, it will not be able to withstand this overturning wind.</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of wind will come after the overturning wind. In short, this year is the "Year of Many Winds". To be honest, we small people do not miss this kind of year; our only hope is that next year will be "good weather and abundant harvest, the country will be peaceful and the people will be safe", and that we small people will no longer suffer!</p>
<p>It has long become a new "people's village". The newly built houses are not three-dimensional red tile bricks, but they are very neat and orderly, and each household is independent, living very freely and comfortably, with bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms, and some beans, wheat, vegetables, and green onions planted on the open space outside the door. Although there is no tap water, it is not a problem to dig a pond for drinking, and each household raises some chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep. Therefore, the New Year's dishes may be richer than those of the salaried Shanghainese.</p>
<p>According to friends, the houses here do not need to be "topped" with gold bars. They are all built by fellow villagers from northern Jiangsu themselves, and the building materials needed are moved from rubble yards elsewhere. The old traders said that they lived so comfortably without spending a penny, and they didn't need the dangerous mouths of the second landlords, and they didn't need to pay rent. "Donations and taxes" were like a horse and a cow to them. Although the landlords had negotiated with them, these fellow villagers from northern Jiangsu really had nowhere to live. As the saying goes, there is only a house to keep people living in, not to demolish the house and drive people out, and everyone has a heart of compassion!</p>
<p>In this new "people's village", there are also several village shops, cigarette paper shops, small teahouses, barber shops, and pancake stalls, which are small but complete.</p>
<p>From here, I saw the self-reliance of the people of northern Jiangsu. Each fellow villager from northern Jiangsu can endure hardship and is hardworking, has no dependency, and can "not ask for help" in every place to live. The children already know how to "scavenge" and sell tea without relying on their parents for food and drink, so I think the people of northern Jiangsu are very worthy of emulation.</p>
<h3>Tail Feeding Dog</h3>
<p>— Gialing</p>
<p>A tax collector delivered a grand speech to many people: "The government and the people are like father and son. Protecting children from being bullied by enemies, educating them, and maintaining them all require money, so the people enthusiastically pay taxes, the more the better, it is really a matter of course!"</p>
<p>One of them listened and said: "I understand, it's like this."</p>
<p>"I keep a puppy. It is hungry and wags its tail at me begging for food. I said to it: 'Dear puppy, you must be very hungry, right? I'm sorry, let me feed you.'"</p>
<p>"I found a knife, cut off its little tail, and sent it to its mouth: 'Eat! My loyal good dog! Eat this piece of meat and replenish your body,' "</p>
<p>The tax collector stopped talking.</p>

<h3>Democracy and Republic</h3>
<p>— Hu Yisheng</p>
<p>In China, there is only "democracy" and no republic. This democracy lacking a republic is just "I am the only one", "I am here". "I" is the most pleasing "note" in the world.</p>
<p>Originally, the trend of the world has universally shifted from individualism to collectivism, but our country is still seeking a way out in the "democracy" of individualism. What can we find out? Adding a lot of "democratic gimmicks" and new bureaucrats who eat "democratic" meals, what is the benefit to China? Wu Zhi Lao said that if you want to achieve world harmony, you must go through thirty-six small wars and seventy-two major wars. With this kind of "democracy" going on, even after seventy-two small wars and one hundred and forty-four major wars, "small harmony" will not come!</p>
<p>I think that China's way out is not in democracy but in a republic, at least it must be said: "A republic is more important than democracy".</p>
<h3>Treating Guests</h3>
<p>— Zimin</p>
<p>"Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!..." A speeding car drove from afar.</p>
<p>A food carrier slowly walked towards the center of the road.</p>
<p>"Stop! Stop! Stop!"</p>
<p>The food carrier was indifferent and continued to walk towards the center of the road.</p>
<p>"Ghost!" With a sharp sound, the car suddenly braked to a halt.</p>
<p>A head poked out of the small window.</p>
<p>"Hey! Friend, are you preparing to treat guests?"</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 20</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Performing Arts and Begging (Continued)</p>
<p>(6) "The True and False Dumbs" — Dumbness is a type of disability, and the beggar gangs also use it as a magic weapon for begging for sympathy. However, there are true and false ones, and the profession is divided into four types. They are called "Hiding from Heaven," "Crying Mouth," "Blocking the Road," and "Acting Real." "Hiding from Heaven" are genuinely mute beggars, while "Crying Mouth" are those who have learned the trick. Pretending to be mute is originally the easiest trick, and their begging is divided into two factions: "Blocking the Road" and "Street Walking." They go their separate ways and do not interfere with each other. "Blocking the Road" involves kneeling by the roadside, knocking their heads on the ground, chanting something, pointing to heaven and earth, then pointing to their own mouths and hearts, patting their chests to beg. "Street Walking" involves begging from house to house. False dumbs gather when begging, and are not allowed to talk as a rule, only being allowed to speak after returning to the "Imperial Incense Hall" (beggar factory).</p>
<p>(7) "Nose Guanyin" — This group must wear straw shoes and tie straw rings on their heads. "Double Dragons Entering the Sea" involves using bamboo to carve two long objects, suspending tassels on the ends. When begging, they insert the bamboo into their nostrils, exposing the tassels outside. "True Dragon Entering the Mouth" is about putting a snake through the nose. Both factions "breathe through one nostril."</p>
<p>(8) "Sitting and Cursing" — With crippled limbs, they sit by the roadside cursing wildly. Their curse goes: "Good feet, good hands, the road to heaven; bad feet, bad hands, the gate to hell. Out in the open, secretly coming, not a penny wasted on empty ground." The singing is full of ups and downs, making people feel pity.</p>
<p>(9) "Selling Ear Picks" — Selling bamboo ear picks along the street is another branch of the beggar gang. The gang calls themselves "Holding a Gauze Hat," not knowing where the meaning comes from. But those who work this profession are unwilling to admit that they are beggars. Probably because the income is not bad, they have already joined the ranks of small vendors. It is said that one must be able to hold a gauze hat with the right hand and be able to independently use a knife to manufacture with the left hand to be considered a family skill.</p>
<p>(10) "Bitter Flesh Knife" — This gang is divided into two types: "Waist Blocking" and "Enclosure." When a "Waist Blocking" beggar goes to the street, they must first wear the upper body and carry a two-foot-long disciplinary knife. When not given money, they would strike their waist hard, leaving new red marks. Making the shopkeepers both surprised and pitying, giving money to end the matter. "Enclosure" is similar to street performances, setting up a venue on the roadside wasteland, asking people for donations. However, these people do not have the good skills of the Jianghu gangs, just randomly bang and knock for a while, deceiving idle people.</p>
<p>(11) "Dancing Single Stick" — Similar to the above, they belong to the sub-category of Jianghu street performances, but are despised by the Jianghu gangs. One type is called "Neat Attributes," which can dance the wooden stick in a variety of ways. Another type is called "Beating Single Stick," which uses three short sticks, one thick and two thin, dancing and begging along the street.</p>
<p>(12) "The True and False Blinds" — If there are true and false dumbs, there must be true and false blinds, and the false blinds are more than the true blinds. The fake goods are called "Cold Look" in the gang, which is also a wonderful metaphor. Holding a bamboo pole, the eyelids turned outwards, hiding the black pupils, it is admirable that they still understand makeup skills. The street call has a saying: "Raise your head and not see the road to heaven, lift your feet and not see the height of the road." Such things cannot be fully remembered. "Rotten Beauty" sitting and begging also belongs to this gang. On the surface, it is covered with sores, displayed on the roadside for exhibition. In fact, most of them use the makeup skills passed down from the beggar gang. In addition, there are those who kneel by the roadside knocking their heads, knocking their foreheads into giant blocks like walnuts. Also belongs to this gang, to be described in detail later.</p>
<h3>As the End of the Year Approaches, Wang Xiaoer Runs Away</h3>
<p>— Wu Shujiang</p>
<p>"I, Wang Xiaoer, am unfortunate to have the surname Wang, and also unfortunate to be named Xiaoer, so in the past, people in society, such as when national affairs were not done well, or the business market was sluggish, they themselves did not work hard, and they all used me, Wang Xiaoer, to make fun of, 'Wang Xiaoer celebrating the New Year,' 'worse every year.'</p>
<p>I, Wang Xiaoer, am just a bit poor, I have not done anything that endangers the country, nor have I done the manipulation and speculation tricks done by unscrupulous merchants. Why is it that when national affairs are not done well, I am used to make fun of them, and when the business market is sluggish, I am also used to make fun of them. Since I, Xiaoer, entered the Republic of China, it is difficult to encounter the end of the year without hearing these insulting words to me, I am really angry.</p>
<p>Now the War of Resistance has been won, and it has been more than a year since the victory. National affairs should gradually be on the right track, and the future of the country is close to a bright and glorious situation. What about the business market? With the guidance and supervision of the government, it will of course be calm and prosperous day by day. What about the people? After this long victory in the War of Resistance, they must of course work hard, become strong, and become new citizens. When I, Wang Xiaoer, welcome the thirty-sixth year with national rejoicing, I formally bid farewell to the people of the country, forever farewell, and I sincerely hope that there will be no Wang Xiaoer in this society from now on, and I also hope that from now on, when things go wrong in society, do not use me, Wang Xiaoer, to make fun of them."</p>
