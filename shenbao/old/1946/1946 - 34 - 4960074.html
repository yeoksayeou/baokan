<h3>建設其間之航業教育</h3>
<p>— 沈繩一</p>
<p>我國航海事業之所以不發達，有謂係缺乏人才之故。惟此種人才缺乏用途，以致學非所用，亦妨害事業之發展，影響所及，至深且鉅。按我國沿海人民，在上古時代已駕舟航海數百里之外。詩經商頌長發篇云：「相士烈烈，海外有截」。相士傳爲商湯遠祖，海外係指今遼東半島而言。在武帝時（西元前一四〇年）載商人之大船，從雷州半島之徐聞合浦啓椗，以達西印度之黃支國。五代時阿刺伯人馬素提（Masudi）撰黃金牧地一書，叙述中國船舶直駛波斯灣貿易情形，可見當時航程之遠。明成祖永樂三年至宣宗宣德六年，二十六年中，娜和七次下西洋，統率二萬七千八百人，駕駛大船六十三艘，由福建省之長樂出五虎門放洋，經三十餘國，其航海生活開始時期，比世界著名航海家發現菲洲南端好望角之耶的士（西元一四入七年，即明宣宗成化二十三年）早八十一年；比尋獲美洲新大陸之哥倫布（西元一四九二年，即明孝宗宏治五年）早八十六年，比發現環繞世界一週必經麥哲倫海峽之麥哲倫（西元一五二〇年，即明武宗芷德十五年）早一百十四年。鄭和之豐功偉績，雄才大略，早震動世界，而我國人民之樂於渡海上生活，更可見一斑。即甲午之戰以前，我國海軍猶居世界第四位；及後水師人才輩出，但因遜淸政治不良，兼之常時盲目崇拜洋人，招商局拒用本國船員，以致無從發展。此次大戰中，我海外二萬餘海員，在盟國船舶服務，忠貞勇毅，較之外人，毫無愧色。至於國人航海技術優異問題，據戰前海關失事船舶統計，中外船主失事比例，爲一比五·六，　　　，　　·新華·新昌諸輪之沉沒，皆爲外藉有力</p>
<p>綜上所述，政府過去對　　　　　　　　　　　　　　之政策，故造成學非所用，用非所學之怪現象。今後我國欲以工業建國，第一須視交通之是否發達；交通發達，必先從永道運輸着手。尤其是在大戰之後，鐵路之破壞頗烈，不若水道運輸之設備修建較易，平時保養費用又省。且商船服務技術人員，平時可供國內水道交通運輸之用，並可透入世界任何角落，如一旦發生戰事，政府立即徵調服役改入運輪艦隊及輔助軍艦，是商船不啻海軍之先鋒，抑亦爲海軍後備隊。航業不發達之國家，斷不足以言海軍之整建，是航業不但具國家經濟價値，在軍事上亦具有重大意義。然而我國渦去航業敎育設施情形如何？則言之殊可痛心。</p>
<p>（甲）軍事學校</p>
<p>（一）馬尾海軍學校：該校創　同治六年，爲船政大臣兼福州船廠總理理沈葆禎奏請設立，名船政學堂，分前後二部：前學堂習法文，授製艦造械各技，，後學堂習英文，授航海管輪諸法。民國二年間，前者改爲福州海軍製造學校，後者改爲福州海軍學校，歸海軍部直轄。民國六年附設海軍飛潛學校，授製造飛機潛艇之術。戰後於二十七年九月由馬尾遷至湖南湘潭，嗣復移貴州桐梓繼續授課，歷年來畢業學生的有八百餘人。</p>
<p>（二）江南水師學堂：成立於前淸光緒十六年八月，校址設於南京儀鳳門，民國元年改爲海軍軍官學校，六年復改爲魚雷槍砲學校，旋即停辦，畢業學生的二百餘人。</p>
<p>（三）烟台海軍學校：成立於前淸光緒二十九年，民初吳淞海軍學校歸併該校。民國十七年遷閩，併閩省海軍學校。</p>
<p>（四）天津水師學堂：光緒六年成立，二十五年即行停閉，畢　　　約二百餘人</p>
<p>（五）黃浦水師學堂：設立於光緒十三年，民初歸北京政府海軍部管轄，改爲廣東海軍學校，抗戰後即停辦，畢業學生的百餘人。</p>
<p>（七）吳淞海軍學校：民國四年停辦，併烟台海軍學校</p>
<p>（七）北京昆明湖水師學堂：成立於光緒十九年，旋即停閉，畢業學生三十餘人。</p>
<p>（八）劉公島水師學堂：光緒十六年成立，旋停閉。畢業學生僅三十餘人。</p>
<p>（九）威海衛及湖北海軍航海班：成立時期極短，人數亦不多。</p>
<p>（十）軍政部電雷學校：該校成立於民國，校址設於江蘇江陰，實質亦爲軍事學校，畢業學生的三百餘人．</p>
<p>上述各校，均爲造成海軍軍官，至民國二十八年止，各校畢業學生，共有二千餘名，其中軍事化學十名，造艦一百七十餘名，水魚雷三十餘名。關於海軍士兵訓練，馬尾海校及電雷學校均設有訓練營。　（乙）商船學校</p>
<p>（一）交通部吳淞商船專門學校：該校爲造就海洋駕駛及輪機人才之最高學府。爲前淸宏閎氏建議郵傳部尚書盛宣懷，將南洋大學（即今交通大學前身）高等實業學堂之船政學堂於前淸宣統三年在吳淞砲台灣獨自成立，定名商船學堂，民元改爲專門學校，時僅設駕駛科一班。至民國四年停辦，畢業學生三十餘人。十八年，始由交通部恢復。添辦輪機科，招收高中畢業學生，肄業四年。校務蒸蒸日上，方期大事擴充，不幸，一二八之戰，該校首當其衝，遭重大損失，戰事平定，逐漸恢復原狀，並附設高級中學，招收初中畢業學生，俾從小即能養成海上生活習慣，校務正圖發展，不意八一三戰事起該校再度被燬，僅携出少些圖書儀器。總計該校先後畢業人數的有三百餘人，分派航空學校或盟國船舶工作。二十入年，政院令交敎海三部在重慶恢復商船學校，改爲國立，增設造船一科。三十二年發生學潮，部令停辦，併入交通大學；造船在工學院另成一系，並另設航海及輪機管理二科。統計渝校共有十二班，學生二百八十餘人，其中由軍委會考選赴美麻省理工學院攻讀盆船；由交通部考選赴美船爲實習者，共約三十餘人，由國營招商局保送或自行請求赴英入太古及藍烟囱公司實習者，的有十餘人，在國內航政機關或輪船公司服務者，有二十餘人。其餘幾全部投效海軍，在美國米亞梅受訓。最近福建省政府及敎育部擬在福州及漢口二地創辦一海事職業學校，招收初中畢業學生。</p>
<p>（二）其他尚有哈爾濱及廣東二商船學校。前者九一八事變後爲僞滿接收，改爲船員養成所，大事擴充，勝利後田敎育部令併入哈爾濱工學院，聞已有畢業學生近百人；後者戰後即停辦</p>
<p>（三）類如商船學校性質者，有招商局自辦一招商公學，民十八歸併入吳淞船校。</p>
<p>（丙）水產學校</p>
<p>水產學校中之漁撈科，亦稍妙關於沿海航行學，招收初中畢業學生，主要爲作育漁輪船主，計有江蘇，浙江二省立水產學校，福建私立集美水產航海學校，天津市立水產學校。戰後除集美遷地繼續上課外，餘均停辦。目前四川合川國立二中附設有水產部。</p>
<p>（丁）稅務學校</p>
<p>財政部稅務專校創辦於前淸宣統元年，民十九年在上海設立海事班，招收高中畢業生，三年畢業，純爲造就海關緝私巡艦駕駛人員。校址設上海姚主敎路，刻在重慶山洞開學，已招收海洋駕駛學生。</p>
<p>（戊）其他訓練班</p>
<p>戰前軍委會有航政訓練班，惟多爲行政人員；戰後交部交通技術人員訓練所曾短期訓練民生公司船員。關於引水人員，因直關軍事性質，另由海軍部設立引水人員傳習所。</p>
<p>綜上所述，我國航業敎育，雖有四五十年之歷史，然迄今無多大成就，航海人才缺乏如故，政局動盪固爲一重大原因，然航業敎育本身，亦具有缺點。茲就管見以申論之。</p>
<p>（一）軍事方面：查船舶服務技術人員，歐美各國通例皆爲海軍後備人員，取取得正式軍籍，唯獨我國不然。海軍與商船，似乎毫無聯擊，船員考得交通部海員執照後，即可服務。至船專稅專諸校，在校所受之軍事訓練，更非驢非馬，不切實用，對於海軍戰術及槍砲運用缺少研究，一旦有事，無法應變。今後我國被列爲强國之一，最起碼的條件，海軍自衛力量，必須大家努力促成，而其方法應從復與航業方面着手。</p>
<p>（二）行政方面：我國開始創辦航業教育以來，即無一貫政策，行政方面，各自爲政，與主管教育機關並不發生直接關係。至二十六年經政院會議決定，將船專稅專二校歸教育部管轄，始上正軌，惜尙未移交，戰事即爆發。船專在重慶由教部恢復，稅專乃由財部辦理。今後航業敎育機關似應統一管轄，確定訓練大綱。教部方面，則以應多聘航業專家主撫摩辦理，並與海軍機關保持密切聯絡。日本以三島彈丸這地，高中級商船學校及船員飬成所即達三十六所之多。目前我國當局如確認爲航業是建國一大要事，自宜即刻改革，現附設於交通大學內之航海管輪二科，設備簡陋，招生不易，應即籌備恢復爲獨立之專門學校，俾事權集中，立可着手成立，至校址地點，可依區域需要設立，設總校於吳淞·大述·黃浦：設分校於各港口，如哈爾濱·天津·靑島·福州·漢口·重慶諸地。總校性質宜由國家設立，一切設備力求完全，各分校則可依照規定，鼓勵私人或省市政府設立。</p>
<p>（三）訓練方面：實科學生，重在實習。航海學校，顧名思義，必須自己備有練船。此種練船以鐵壳，裝有推進機之帆船的三四千噸爲宜，在校在船應分段學習。如半年在校授課，半年後上船，再下船授課，如此連學運用，不但時間經濟，且技術亦可猛進。畢業後隨練船週遊世界，藉以增加閱歷。各分校相當於職業學校，受初步航海訓練，畢業後經嚴格之學識·體格·心理測騐後，始得再入總校。另一爲低級海員（包括舵工，水手，機匠等）之訓練問題。此輩海員雖學識較差，但海上經騐極爲豐當，應由商船總校成立各種訓練班，分期調訓，使學識技術，融會貫通以應變，至於生活方面則培養其趣味嗜好，使重度海上生活時不感寂寞。此類工作，過去政府似未曾注意·近來各海外重要港口設有海員俱樂部·法良意美，將來本國沿海各港埠亦可同樣成立，並可擴大成爲一服務及敎育機關。</p>
<p>（四）科系方面：戰前船校設立駕駛輪機二科，造船僅同濟大學工學院附設一組。以如此稀少科系所造就之人才，應付內江航運，尚嫌不够，遑論近海甚主外洋航運。蓋一龐大之航海事業所需要之人才，例如：輪船公司之業務管理人員；船用儀器之設計·製造·測騐·校正人員；造船司，騐船司；港務之港口及航行標輪管理設施人員；各內港之引水人員；發生海難後海損理算人員，國際貿易人員等；除業務，國際貿易可於各大學商學院栽培外，其他均應由商船學校專設科系儘量造就，以應需要。</p>
<p>復員並不是復原，要以昨日死今日生之精神辦事業。我們須未雨綢繆，趕緊準備，爲國家樹百年大計，建立一個龐大之商船隊。願全國上下及航業界人士，羣策羣力以促成之！</p>

<h3>美國電影事業近況</h3>
<p>— 錢正聲</p>
<p>美國電影事業集中於好萊塢，好萊塢位於加利福尼亞省南部洛杉磯城西，因該城氣候良好，整年可見日光，利於攝影，且有出·有水·有沙漢·各種地勢，一應俱全，對於拍攝外景，尤稱方便，故無形中成爲電影事業之中心。製片公司的共六十餘家，其中的四十家製造戲劇影片，四家製造「卡通」片，六家製造敎育片，十家製造工商業用影片；此外電影用品器材製造廠家，以及影片洗印廠家，共的有五十餘家。</p>
<p>製造戲劇影片之廠家中，最重要者有十，以其所產影片租金收入而言有所謂「五巨頭」之稱，即米高梅公司（Metro　Goldwyn　Mayer　），二十世紀福斯公司（20th　Century-Fox），派拉蒙公司（Paramout），華納公司(Warner　Brothers），及雷電華公司（Ｒ．Ｋ．Ｏ．），此五公司，的占電影業總收入三分之二以上，計米高梅公司占百分之十八，二十世紀福斯公司，派拉蒙公司及華納公司各占百分之十四，雷電華公司占百分之九，其他如哥倫比亞公司，（Columbia）環球公司（Universal），各占百分之七，共和公司（Republic），及蒙諾格拉公司（Monogram），以及其他小公司共占百分之十。</p>
<p>電影業性質特異，成本之高爲一般人所不易瞭解，而各公司對於其財政狀况詳情，亦因以不欲宣佈。據一九三九年調查各公司製片（複印不計其內）成本，共的値一八六〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。一九三九年以後尚無數字，惟據一般估計，一九四四年該項成本當已增至二五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元至三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元之間。全美電影業每年出品戲劇影片，平均係二百五十套，是以每片平均成本的計一百萬美元。其中規模最大者，高達五百萬美元，最小者亦達十餘萬美元。此項成本中，統計的四分之三係屬員工之薪金工資，尤以高級職員·導演·高級演員·劇本編作者等，收入特高。</p>
<p>電影業由於成本特高，其資本利潤不如一般想像之高，在美國各項工業中的占第十位。據一九三九年統計，全美電影院門票收入共的六五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。近年來續有增加，一九四四年份估計當在一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元以上。此項國內市塲門票收入中的百分之六十五爲戲院所得，百分之三十五爲製片公司所獲租金；此項租金適足平衡製片成本（的票收百分之二十五）及推銷成本。（的百分之十）是以電影業絕不能僅賴國內市塲，其利潤來源端在國外市塲。據一般估計，此項國外市塲之租金收人，的當國內門票收入百分之十一。其中英國及中國占最大多數，是以美國電影業之爭奪海外市場之努力當可想見·</p>
<h3>到天空去！「長空萬里」編導者言</h3>
<p>— 孫瑜</p>
<p>「長空萬里」四個字應該用燦爛的黃金來寫，應該用輝煌的閃電來寫，因爲這一部影片所記錄是我們偉大光榮的中國空軍。</p>
<p>「以寡克衆」，「以一當百」，是我們英勇空軍至大無畏的胆量·這靑年的「天之騙子」，我們神聖的民族解放戰爭中的急先鋒啊，它的光榮的戰績是多麼値得我們的歌頌和永念！</p>
<p>與其說「長空萬里」是戲劇片，不如說它是記錄片。沒有驚奇曲折的淸節來掀起淸感的浪濤，更沒有充分的技術設備去攝取空戰的億大，我只於很平淡樸素地——也許讓節奏太過緩漫地－－描述了幾個空軍的投考，學習，遊息，和參加戰鬥的經過，沒有固定的主角，也自然沒有預期的高潮。八九個演員平均地瓜分了戲；全部影片的湖面上僅於閃動着一塲一塲短劇的微波而已。</p>
<p>完全沒有去避免所謂一美國作風」，在我在倡導那「玩是玩，工作是工作」的熱忱裏，很疑心是否太描寫了所謂那種美國式的「活潑」「趣味」和「勇敢』？</p>
<p>對於我們那些駕着飛機在萬尺高空和敵人在幾分鐘甚至幾秒鐘內就要決定「你死我活」，「不成功，便成仁」的戰士們，當他們在地面上休息的時候，就讓他們多笑幾聲，多跳幾下，鬆弛一會兒他們的過度緊張的神經，也許是不無一點理由的吧？</p>
<p>在天空中，我們空中英雄們忠勇無畏的戰鬥精神不是早已照耀在全世界的驚奇崇仰中嗎？</p>
<p>「長空萬里」製了三年　得完成。由此可以想見我們在攝製時所曾遭受過的困苦和折磨了。在「勉爲其難」的固執信念下．在悠久的三個寒暑裏，我和工作同志們曾經琉過不少的汗，也流過小量的血，或許灑幾點沒有人看見的英雄淚，假若英雄們也流淚的話。</p>
<p>當我執筆爲本片完成之日想寫幾個字時，眞覺得有一點千頭萬緒的味道。記得十幾年前續過拜侖的幾句英文詩，大意是：</p>
<p>「假若我胸中一切的思想，感情，悲痛，憤怒……</p>
<p>能够用一個字說得出來，</p>
<p>而那一個字是「電」，我就說了；</p>
<p>不然，我寧可不說，把我的思想，</p>
<p>像利劍一般地插它回劍鞘里去！」</p>
<p>最後，我們謹向全國有爲的靑年們提出一個懇切的熱烈的口號：「到天空去！」</p>

<h3>Naval Education During Construction</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengyi</p>
<p>The reason why China's maritime industry is underdeveloped is said to be due to a lack of talent. However, this kind of talent lacks purpose, leading to learning not being applied, which also hinders the development of the industry, with far-reaching and profound impacts. According to historical records, the people along China's coast were already sailing hundreds of miles offshore in ancient times. The "Long Hair" chapter of the "Shang Song" in the Book of Songs states, "Xiang Shi was illustrious, reaching beyond the seas." It is said that Xiang Shi was a distant ancestor of Shang Tang, and "overseas" refers to the Liaodong Peninsula today. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (140 BC), large merchant ships set sail from Xuwen and Hepu on the Leizhou Peninsula to reach Huangzhi State in West India. During the Five Dynasties period, the Arab Masudi wrote the book "The Meadows of Gold," describing Chinese ships sailing directly to the Persian Gulf for trade, which shows the distance of voyages at that time. From the third year of the Yongle reign of Emperor Chengzu of Ming to the sixth year of the Xuande reign of Emperor Xuanzong, during twenty-six years, Zheng He sailed to the West seven times, leading 27,800 people, piloting 63 large ships, setting sail from Wuhu Gate in Changle, Fujian Province, passing through more than thirty countries. His maritime life began eighty-one years earlier than the famous world navigator Diaz, who discovered the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa (1487 AD, which is the twenty-third year of the Chenghua reign of Emperor Xianzong of Ming); eighty-six years earlier than Columbus, who discovered the New World of America (1492 AD, which is the fifth year of the Hongzhi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Ming); and one hundred and fourteen years earlier than Magellan, who discovered the Strait of Magellan, a necessary passage around the world (1520 AD, which is the fifteenth year of the Zhengde reign of Emperor Wuzong of Ming). Zheng He's great achievements and extraordinary talents shook the world long ago, and the eagerness of the Chinese people to live a life at sea is even more evident. Even before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Chinese navy ranked fourth in the world. Later, naval talents emerged in large numbers, but due to the poor politics of the corrupt Qing Dynasty, coupled with the constant blind worship of foreigners, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company refused to employ Chinese crew members, resulting in a lack of development. During the recent World War, more than 20,000 Chinese sailors served on Allied ships, demonstrating loyalty, bravery, and courage, no less than foreigners. As for the excellent maritime technology of Chinese people, according to pre-war statistics of ship accidents from the Customs, the ratio of accidents between Chinese and foreign shipowners was one to five point six. The sinking of the *Xinhua* and *Xinchang* vessels were all caused by foreign</p>
<p>In summary, the government's past policies towards have led to the strange phenomenon of learning not being applied and application not being based on learning. In the future, if China wants to build the country through industry, the first thing we need to consider is whether transportation is developed. If transportation is developed, we must start with waterway transportation. Especially after the war, the destruction of railways is quite severe, not as easy as the construction and repair of waterway transportation facilities, and the maintenance cost is lower in peacetime. Moreover, technical personnel serving on merchant ships can be used for domestic waterway transportation in peacetime and can penetrate any corner of the world. If war breaks out, the government can immediately requisition them for service and convert them into transport fleets and auxiliary warships. Merchant ships are no less than the vanguard of the navy, and also the navy's reserve force. A country with an underdeveloped maritime industry is not qualified to talk about the construction and consolidation of the navy. Therefore, the maritime industry not only has national economic value, but also has significant military significance. However, what was the situation of maritime education facilities in China in the past? It is very painful to talk about it.</p>
<p>(A) Military Schools</p>
<p>(1) Mawei Naval Academy: Founded in the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign, established by Shen Baozhen, the Minister of Naval Affairs and General Manager of the Fuzhou Shipyard, named the Ship Administration Academy, divided into two parts: the former academy studied French and taught various skills in building ships and manufacturing machinery, and the latter academy studied English and taught various methods of navigation and marine engineering. In the second year of the Republic of China, the former was renamed Fuzhou Naval Manufacturing School, and the latter was renamed Fuzhou Naval School, directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the Naval Aviation and Submersible School was established, teaching the art of manufacturing airplanes and submarines. After the war, in September of the twenty-seventh year, it moved from Mawei to Xiangtan, Hunan, and then moved to Tongzi, Guizhou, to continue teaching. Over the years, more than 800 students have graduated.</p>
<p>(2) Jiangnan Naval Academy: Established in August of the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the previous Qing Dynasty, located at Yifeng Gate in Nanjing. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed Naval Officer School, and in the sixth year it was renamed Torpedo and Gunnery School, which was soon discontinued. More than 200 students graduated.</p>
<p>(3) Yantai Naval Academy: Established in the twenty-ninth year of the Guangxu reign of the previous Qing Dynasty. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Wusong Naval Academy was merged into this school. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, it moved to Fujian and merged with the Fujian Provincial Naval School.</p>
<p>(4) Tianjin Naval Academy: Established in the sixth year of the Guangxu reign, closed in the twenty-fifth year. Approximately 200 students graduated.</p>
<p>(5) Huangpu Naval Academy: Established in the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy of the Beijing government and renamed Guangdong Naval Academy. It was discontinued after the War of Resistance. More than 100 students graduated.</p>
<p>(6) Wusong Naval Academy: Discontinued in the fourth year of the Republic of China and merged into the Yantai Naval Academy.</p>
<p>(7) Beijing Kunming Lake Naval Academy: Established in the nineteenth year of the Guangxu reign and soon closed. More than 30 students graduated.</p>
<p>(8) Liugong Island Naval Academy: Established in the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign and soon closed. Only more than 30 students graduated.</p>
<p>(9) Weihaiwei and Hubei Naval Navigation Classes: The period of establishment was very short, and the number of students was not large.</p>
<p>(10) Ministry of Military Administration's Electrical Torpedo School: Established in the Republic of China, located in Jiangyin, Jiangsu, it was essentially also a military school. More than 300 students graduated.</p>
<p>The above schools were all for training naval officers. By the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, a total of more than 2,000 students had graduated from these schools, including ten in military chemistry, more than 170 in shipbuilding, and more than 30 in torpedoes. Regarding naval soldier training, the Mawei Naval Academy and the Electrical Torpedo School both had training camps.</p>
<p>(B) Merchant Marine Schools</p>
<p>(1) Ministry of Communications' Wusong Merchant Marine College: This school is the highest institution for cultivating ocean-going navigation and marine engineering talents. It was established by Mr. Hong Hong's suggestion to Sheng Xuanhuai, the Minister of Posts and Communications, to independently establish the Ship Administration School of Nanyang University (the predecessor of today's Jiaotong University) at Baotaiwan, Wusong, in the third year of the Xuantong reign of the previous Qing Dynasty, named Merchant Marine School. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed College, with only one navigation course. It was discontinued in the fourth year of the Republic of China. More than 30 students graduated. In the eighteenth year, it was restored by the Ministry of Communications. A marine engineering course was added, recruiting high school graduates for four years of study. The school's affairs were flourishing, and it was expected to expand greatly. Unfortunately, the January 28 Incident struck the school first and suffered heavy losses. After the war, it gradually returned to its original state and established a senior high school, recruiting junior high school graduates, so that they could develop maritime life habits from an early age. As the school was developing, the August 13 Incident broke out, and the school was destroyed again, with only a few books and instruments salvaged. In total, the school has graduated more than 300 people, who were assigned to aviation schools or Allied ships. In the twenty-eighth year, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Navy, and the Ministry of Communications to restore the Merchant Marine School in Chongqing, renamed it as a national school, and added a shipbuilding course. In the thirty-second year, a student movement occurred, and the ministry ordered it to be discontinued and merged into Jiaotong University; shipbuilding became a separate department in the School of Engineering, and two departments of navigation and marine engineering management were established. Statistics showed that there were twelve classes in the Chongqing school, with more than 280 students. Among them, students selected by the Military Commission to study naval architecture at MIT in the United States, and those selected by the Ministry of Communications to practice on ships in the United States, totaled about 30 people. More than ten people were sent by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company or requested to study at Taikoo and Blue Funnel Line in England. More than twenty people worked in domestic maritime administration agencies or shipping companies. The rest all joined the navy and were trained in Miami, USA. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Government and the Ministry of Education plan to establish a maritime vocational school in Fuzhou and Hankou, recruiting junior high school graduates.</p>
<p>(2) There are also two other merchant marine schools, Harbin and Guangdong. The former was taken over by the Puppet Manchukuo after the September 18th Incident and renamed the Seamen Training Center, which was greatly expanded. After the victory, the Ministry of Education ordered it to be merged into the Harbin Institute of Technology. It is said that nearly 100 students have graduated. The latter was discontinued after the war.</p>
<p>(3) Similar to merchant marine schools, there is also the China Merchants Public School, which was run by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company itself. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, it was merged into the Wusong Merchant Marine School.</p>
<p>(C) Fisheries Schools</p>
<p>The fishing and netting department of fisheries schools also focuses on coastal navigation studies, recruiting junior high school graduates, mainly to cultivate fishing boat owners. These include the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial fisheries schools, the Fujian private Jimei Fisheries and Navigation School, and the Tianjin municipal fisheries school. After the war, except for Jimei, which moved to another location to continue classes, the others were all discontinued. Currently, the National No. 2 Middle School in Hechuan, Sichuan, has a fisheries department.</p>
<p>(D) Customs Schools</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Customs College was founded in the first year of the Xuantong reign of the previous Qing Dynasty. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, a maritime affairs class was established in Shanghai, recruiting high school graduates for three years, purely for cultivating customs anti-smuggling patrol ship drivers. Located on Yaozhu Road in Shanghai, it is now opening classes in Shandong, Chongqing, and has already recruited ocean-going navigation students.</p>
<p>(E) Other Training Courses</p>
<p>Before the war, the Military Commission had maritime administration training courses, but they were mostly for administrative personnel. After the war, the Ministry of Communications' transportation technology personnel training center briefly trained Minsheng Company crew members. Regarding pilots, due to their direct military nature, the Naval Department established a pilot training institute.</p>
<p>In summary, China's maritime education has a history of forty or fifty years, but it has not achieved much to date. The lack of maritime talent remains the same. Political turmoil is a major reason, but maritime education itself also has shortcomings. I will now discuss these shortcomings based on my limited observations.</p>
<p>(1) Military Aspects: In all European and American countries, technical personnel serving on ships are generally reserve naval personnel and obtain formal military status, but this is not the case in China. The navy and merchant ships seem to have no connection at all. Crew members can serve once they obtain a seafarer's license from the Ministry of Communications. The military training received in schools such as the Merchant Marine College and the Customs College is neither fish nor fowl, and is not practical. They lack research on naval tactics and the use of firearms. In the event of an emergency, they cannot respond. In the future, if China is to be listed as one of the great powers, the most basic condition is that the navy's self-defense force must be promoted by everyone, and the method should start with the revitalization of the maritime industry.</p>
<p>(2) Administrative Aspects: Since China began to establish maritime education, there has been no consistent policy. In terms of administration, each unit acts on its own and has no direct relationship with the competent educational authority. It was not until the twenty-sixth year, when the Executive Yuan decided to place the Merchant Marine College and the Customs College under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, that things began to get on the right track, but unfortunately, the war broke out before the transfer could be completed. The Merchant Marine College was restored by the Ministry of Education in Chongqing, while the Customs College was run by the Ministry of Finance. In the future, maritime education institutions should be under unified jurisdiction and a training outline should be determined. The Ministry of Education should hire more maritime experts to preside over the affairs and maintain close contact with naval agencies. In Japan, a small island nation, there are as many as thirty-six senior and junior merchant marine schools and crew training centers. If the current authorities recognize that the maritime industry is a major event in national construction, they should immediately reform it. The two departments of navigation and marine engineering currently attached to Jiaotong University have simple equipment and are difficult to recruit students. Preparations should be made immediately to restore them as an independent college, so that authority can be centralized and work can begin immediately. As for the location of the school, it can be established according to regional needs, with the main campus in Wusong, Datun, and Huangpu, and branch campuses in various ports, such as Harbin, Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Hankou, and Chongqing. The nature of the main campus should be established by the state, and all equipment should be as complete as possible. The branch campuses can be established by private individuals or provincial and municipal governments in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>(3) Training Aspects: For practical students, the focus is on practice. A navigation school, as the name implies, must have its own training ship. This type of training ship should be a three- or four-thousand-ton sailing ship with an iron hull and a propulsion engine. Students should study in segments at the school and on the ship. For example, half a year of lectures at school, half a year on the ship, and then back to school for lectures. This way, learning and application can be combined, which is not only time-efficient but also improves skills rapidly. After graduation, they can travel the world with the training ship to increase their experience. The branch campuses are equivalent to vocational schools, providing initial maritime training. After graduation, they can only enter the main campus again after strict academic, physical, and psychological tests. Another problem is the training of junior seamen (including helmsmen, sailors, machinists, etc.). Although these seamen have less academic knowledge, they have very rich maritime experience. The Merchant Marine College should establish various training courses to train them in stages, so that academic knowledge and technology can be integrated to respond to emergencies. As for the living aspects, they should cultivate their hobbies and interests so that they do not feel lonely when they lead a life at sea. The government seems to have not paid attention to this type of work in the past. Recently, major overseas ports have seamen's clubs, which is a good practice. In the future, the same can be established in domestic coastal ports and expanded into a service and education institution.</p>
<p>(4) Department Aspects: Before the war, the Merchant Marine College established navigation and marine engineering departments. Shipbuilding was only affiliated with a group in the School of Engineering of Tongji University. The talent cultivated by such scarce departments is not enough to cope with inland river transportation, let alone near-sea and even ocean-going transportation. The talents needed for a huge maritime undertaking include: business management personnel of shipping companies; design, manufacturing, testing, and calibration personnel of ship instruments; naval architects and surveyors; port and navigation mark management facility personnel for port affairs; pilots for various inland ports; marine loss adjusters after maritime accidents, international trade personnel, etc. Except for business and international trade, which can be cultivated in the business schools of various universities, all others should be cultivated by the Merchant Marine School with dedicated departments as much as possible to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Recovery is not restoration. We must run the business with the spirit of "death yesterday, life today." We must prepare ahead of time, prepare quickly, establish a long-term plan for the country, and build a huge merchant fleet. I hope that the whole country and people in the maritime industry will work together to promote it!</p>

<h3>Cantonese Restaurant Work-to-Rule Action. Mediation Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The work-to-rule action launched by Cantonese restaurants on the 30th of last month has seen a gradual increase in participating establishments, reaching 38 as of yesterday. Labor and management had previously negotiated on their own on the 27th and 28th, but without results. On the following day, they applied to the Bureau of Social Affairs for mediation. Zhu Guilin of the Bureau's Mediation Section telephoned the employee representatives of each restaurant on the 1st, stating that mediation could not be arranged on that day, the 2nd was a holiday for the Spring Festival, and today is Sunday. Therefore, formal mediation will begin tomorrow. Each restaurant employee representative is represented by two people with the main offices being located on the third floor of the Nanguo Restaurant on Guizhou Road. The representatives will negotiate with external parties while taking care of internal liaison. The labor side has put forward a total of twelve demands, the most important of which are: (1) Each person receives an annual bonus of 35,000 yuan (management only agrees to 3,500 yuan). (2) In the future, the share of extra earnings will be distributed with 95% going to the labor and 5% to management. (3) The managers of Sisiemei, Dadong, and Meihua wrongfully dismissed employee representatives Zheng Puyi, and they should be reinstated immediately.</p>

<h3>Warehouse Goods Incomplete.</h3>
<p>Inventory Still Takes Time (Our Reporter) According to sources, since the Jianghai Customs was ordered to assist the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau in inventorying enemy and puppet warehouses, it has completed the inventory and prepared inventories for more than 400 warehouses. The total value of the warehoused goods inventoried exceeds 8,800,000,000 yuan. Once the inventory of these warehouses is completed, the Jianghai Customs will affix additional seals. It is reported that during the inventory of the above-mentioned warehouses, the material inventory lists transferred by the original sealing agency were often incomplete, forcing the customs to re-inventory and prepare lists one by one, making the work tedious and time-consuming. Currently, the Jianghai Customs has more than 500 personnel participating in the inventory and management, but there are more than 2,000 enemy and puppet warehouses waiting to be inventoried. It is expected that it will take considerable time to complete the entire inventory. It is reported that the warehouses that have been inventoried mainly contain grain and cloth, which are prone to spoilage. These goods have been stored in warehouses for many years, and there is a risk of damage, and a large amount of warehouse rental fees must be paid every month. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can expedite the processing and distribution.</p>

<h3>Manufacturers Purchasing China Textile Yarn. Manufacturers Should Register and Obtain Certification from Association</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] China Textile Construction Corporation has issued several batches of cotton cloth, but in the past, sales have not been widespread among manufacturers. In order to improve the situation, the company has formulated measures for manufacturers to register and apply for certification, and has created registration cards for manufacturers to fill out and submit to the association for certification. The dyeing and weaving association has reportedly obtained blank registration cards from the company. If members need to register, they can obtain registration cards from the association, fill them out, and submit them for certification, which will then be sent to the Textile Construction Company.</p>

<h3>Current State of the American Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Qian Zheng Sheng</p>
<p>The American film industry is concentrated in Hollywood, located west of Los Angeles in Southern California. The city's favorable climate, with year-round sunlight suitable for filming, and its diverse terrain, including mountains, water, deserts, and various landscapes, provide convenience for shooting outdoor scenes, making it the natural center of the film industry. There are over sixty film production companies, with forty producing drama films, four producing "cartoon" films, six producing educational films, and ten producing industrial and commercial films. In addition, there are over fifty manufacturers of film supplies and equipment, as well as film processing plants.</p>
<p>Among the drama film production companies, the ten most important are known as the "Big Five" in terms of film rental revenue. These are Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (Metro Goldwyn Mayer), 20th Century-Fox, Paramount, Warner Brothers, and R.K.O. These five companies account for over two-thirds of the total film industry revenue. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer accounts for 18%, 20th Century-Fox, Paramount, and Warner Brothers each account for 14%, and R.K.O. accounts for 9%. Other companies such as Columbia and Universal each account for 7%, while Republic, Monogram, and other small companies account for a total of 10%.</p>
<p>The film industry has unique characteristics, with costs that are difficult for the general public to understand. Companies are also reluctant to disclose detailed information about their financial situation. According to a 1939 survey, the total cost of film production (excluding reprints) was $1,860,000,000. There are no figures available after 1939, but it is generally estimated that this cost had increased to between $2,500,000,000 and $3,000,000,000 by 1944. The American film industry produces an average of 250 drama films per year, with an average cost of $1 million per film. The largest productions cost up to $5 million, while the smallest cost over $100,000. Of this cost, approximately three-quarters is attributed to employee salaries and wages, particularly for senior executives, directors, leading actors, and screenwriters, who earn particularly high incomes.</p>
<p>Due to the high costs, the profit margins of the film industry are not as high as generally imagined, ranking tenth among various industries in the United States. According to 1939 statistics, total box office revenue in the United States was $650,000,000. This has continued to increase in recent years, with estimates for 1944 exceeding $1,000,000,000. Of this domestic market box office revenue, 65% is earned by theaters, and 35% is rental revenue earned by production companies. This rental revenue is sufficient to balance production costs (25% of box office revenue) and marketing costs (10%). Therefore, the film industry cannot rely solely on the domestic market; its profit source lies in the foreign market. It is generally estimated that the rental revenue from the foreign market accounts for 11% of domestic box office revenue. The United Kingdom and China account for the largest share. The efforts of the American film industry to compete for overseas markets are therefore quite evident.</p>
<h3>To the Sky! Remarks by the Director and Writer of "A Thousand Miles of Sky"</h3>
<p>— Sun Yu</p>
<p>The four characters "A Thousand Miles of Sky" should be written in brilliant gold, they should be written in glorious lightning, because this film records our great and glorious Chinese Air Force.</p>
<p>"Defeating the many with the few," "Facing hundreds as one," is the supreme fearless courage of our heroic Air Force. These young "cheaters of the sky," these vanguards of our sacred national liberation war, their glorious achievements are so worthy of our praise and eternal remembrance!</p>
<p>Rather than calling "A Thousand Miles of Sky" a drama, it is more like a documentary. There are no surprising or intricate plots to stir up emotional waves, nor is there sufficient technical equipment to capture the immensity of aerial combat. I simply described, in a very plain and simple manner—perhaps with a rhythm that is too slow—the process of a few airmen enlisting, learning, relaxing, and participating in combat. There are no fixed protagonists, and naturally no anticipated climax. Eight or nine actors evenly divide the roles; the entire film's surface only ripples with short scenes.</p>
<p>I completely avoided the so-called "American style." In my advocacy of the enthusiasm of "playing is playing, work is work," I am very suspicious as to whether I have over-portrayed that American-style "liveliness," "fun," and "bravery"?</p>
<p>For our warriors who pilot planes at ten thousand feet and have to decide "you die or I live" within minutes or even seconds, should we allow them to laugh more, jump more, and relax their over-tense nerves a little when they rest on the ground? Perhaps there is some reason for that?</p>
<p>In the sky, hasn't the loyal and fearless fighting spirit of our aerial heroes already shone in the world's amazement and admiration?</p>
<p>"A Thousand Miles of Sky" took three years to complete. From this, one can imagine the hardships and torments we suffered during filming. Under the stubborn belief of "reluctantly making do," during the long three years, my colleagues and I shed a lot of sweat and a little blood, perhaps sprinkling a few tears of heroes that no one saw, if heroes also shed tears.</p>
<p>When I picked up my pen to write a few words on the day the film was completed, I really felt a sense of having a thousand threads to pull. I remember reciting a few lines of English poetry by Byron more than ten years ago, which meant:</p>
<p>"If all the thoughts, feelings, sorrows, angers... in my chest</p>
<p>Could be expressed in one word,</p>
<p>And that word were "electricity," I would say it;</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would rather not say it, and put my thoughts,</p>
<p>Like a sharp sword, back into its scabbard!"</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to offer a sincere and enthusiastic slogan to the promising young people of the country: "Go to the sky!"</p>
