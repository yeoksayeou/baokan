<p>〔美新聞處北平十七日電〕秦德純（陳誠代表），羅瑞卿（周恩來代表）今晨偕同其參謀人員飛返重慶，吉倫中將則留北平，將隨馬帥同時返渝。</p>

<p>〔合衆社重慶十七日電〕政府代表今日與靑年黨代表舉行會談，期在政府改組等政治問題上，穫得協義，但除進展甚少之消息外，並無詳細情形發表。宣專部長吳國楨謂：渠悉綜合小組委會，在困難之草憲問題上原則上已獲得協議，盼將規定事項記諸書面。吳氏相信已獲得妥協，但因此後仍有爭執可能，故未將詳情披露。據悉國民黨決將國府委員會內共黨席數限爲八席</p>

<h3>安理會繼伊朗案件後　昨討論西國問題　伊朗亞省境內發現激戰</h3>

<h3>日本普選結果　已獲麥帥批准　四強管委會議中一塲爭辯　對蘇方指責予以明白答覆</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十七日專電〕麥帥已批准此次日本普選結果，故獲勝之自由黨領袖鳩山一郞，將成爲民主日本之第一任首相。麥師之代表本晨於四强對日委員會會議中，宣讀麥帥之聲明，日本多時之政治僵局，茲乃闢開途徑。唯此聲明頗受一般挫折，尤以盟國記者之反饗爲甚。蓋此問盟國記者均因鳩山過去之政治歷史，而對其嚴加指責也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十七日電〕管制日本委員會今日開會時，麥帥總部官員魏特尼以銳利語調，答復蘇聯代表特萊夫塲柯關於麥帥總部肅淸命令效力之質問。據稱，日本政府服從各項肅淸命令及佔領政策，執行頗爲迅速，關於肅淸命令執行情形之一切情報，自可供給蘇聯。蘇聯指責日本若干不良份子並未黜退一層，不過抄襲蘇聯各報最近所載資料而已。管制委會蘇代表或其他代表未嘗自麥帥總部覓取此項情報，則彼等對於日本執行肅清命之情形，自無所知。蘇聯指摘日本民治不能正常進展一節，亦爲選舉揭曉以前之事，未免有過時之嫌，特萊夫揚柯如能熟視日本人民參加選舉情形，即不致如此輕下斷語。惟日本欲完成民主政治固爲期尙遙，但彼等有此企圖，當予以信任。總之，本月十日之選舉實爲一種民主的表現，證明日木人民旣不偏左亦不偏右，聯合國佔領政策亦可於此取信於人矣。</p>

<h3>接見報特派記者　幣原談中日關係　過雲錯誤係日軍閥所造成　稱頌蔣主席寬大爲懷</h3>
<p>〔本報東京十七日專電〕本報特派員昨“往訪“首相幣原於其實所，談一小時之久。記老詢以大選後是否提出辭呈，幣原答稱尙未決定。記者復詢以內閣是否將有變動，幣原答謂此事須由麥帥加以決定。提及此次大選事，幣原作如下之詳逆：余曾到距舍問不遠之投票處，祗見參加者踴躍而有秩序，且有女性在內，對於此事，余極感興趣。記者旋又以上星期日羣衆之反幣原政府運動相詢，據謂參加者並非示威人物，而實係鳥合之衆。記者當即提出反問日：「當時在塲者達七萬人之多，豈彼等均爲烏合之衆耶？」幣原始聆言，默不作答，祗作苦笑，面有啼笑皆非之慨。</p>
<p>記者詢以未來中日關係，幣原稱，中日兩國必須携手前進，此項政策在十五年前，本人即力主其實現，當時障碍頗多，故未成功。此種障碍，大多數係由日軍人造成，但亦有由中國政府促成者，例如當余任上相時，曾委派專使赴華，但遭拒絕，此外在滿洲發生之事件，中國政府亦未能迅速予以解決，當時有日軍官一名，已獲中國政府所許可而進行成察滿洲，突遭殺斃，因而造成兩國問之緊張關係，日本民衆　行大會，反對余之親華政策，其時余曾與中國駐日公使汪榮實論及兩國之緊張局勢。記者詢以滿洲事件是否係由日軍閥所製造，孫原點不作答，僅謂無論如何，中日兩國未來必須密切合作。</p>
<p>幣原又稱，日本投降後，中國蔣主席曾發表演說，本人至爲感動，該項演詞不特已使旅華日人獲得安全，且蒙極友好之待遇，此爲中國偉大之處·中日關係傎誠而愉快，前途未可限量，蔣主席之寬大爲懷，令人感悟。</p>

<h3>迎馬歇爾元帥返任</h3>
<p>美國社魯門總統駐華特使馬歇爾元帥月前返國述職，於十二日偕同夫人，飛離美京，返任來華，經於日昨行抵北平。這位高齡的五星元帥，不辭勞苦，僕僕風塵，往來於中美之間，致力於加强中美關係，維繫世界和平，中國人民實在對他要表示無限的崇敬與感奮。溯自馬氏蒞任以來，在過去短短三個月的時間中，曾爲中國的統一和平立下了不可磨滅的功跡；今茲返任重來，現階段的形勢，與當初馬氏回國時的情勢已大有懸殊。今日東北的蘇軍雖已撤離瀋陽長春，而駐防長春負有接收任務的少數國軍，却遭所謂共軍的猛擊，戰鬥正在激烈展開，共軍一部且已侵入市區，而在國內的政治晴空上，「政協」以來的和諧空氣，亦已爲憤恨與野心所籠罩。共產黨的機關報，竟至公然侮辱元苜，詆毀政府，囂張跋扈之氣燄，不可一世。凡此種種，均足使馬歇爾元帥的努力付諸東流－茲當馬歇爾元帥重蒞中國之際，願就當前中國局勢，的略有所論列，藉表歡迎之誠。</p>
<p>我們首先要說的，就是中次兩國的利益完全相同。因爲兩國的利益相同，所以馬歇爾元帥的努力，不特爲美國人民所崇敬，同樣亦爲中國人民所崇敬。中國需要和統一，而美國對華的傳統政策亦在支持一個領土主權完整的中國。美國的政策，與中國人民的要求，正相符合。中國自一九一一年革命以來，山國父孫先生創造民國，即擬追隨歐美民主先進，實行民主之治；奈其時有袁世凱之竊國，繼之以軍閥及地方勢力之割據，遂致民主建國大業，橫遭頓挫。中國國民黨爲完遂國民革命，建立統一强固之民主的中國計，本革命之三民主義，出師北伐，全國方吿統一。國民政府正撥致力建國之際，日本軍閥却又加緊侵略，終至由蘆溝橋事變而引起全面抗戰。中國國民黨是創造中華民國的政黨，中國是在國民黨的執政下，在蔣主席的英明領導下，完遂全面抗戰的任務而得到勝利。中國國民黨所崇奉的三民主義，已由其它政黨一致接受爲建國的量高指導原則。三民主義的精神，是採取了西方文明和民主政治的精華而與我國固有的傳統相調和。三民主義的新中國，將爲世界和平有所致力，將爲人類開殖一種燦爛的新文化。這代表中國人民一般的意向，必定與太平洋彼岸的美國盟邦人士聲應氣求，脗合無問。</p>
<p>因此，中國的統一和平，中國的民主政治，由過去歷史言，由將來趨勢言，國民黨盡力必獨多。國民黨近來的作風，雖未必能處處令人滿意，然而我們却不能否認國民黨的統治究不失爲一種安定力量；尤其不能否認國民歲的理想，與西歐的當然也包括美國的民主政治最爲接近。中國人民雖並不個個都擁護國民黨，但他們確信還只有在國民黨的統治下，多少能够享有一些基本自由。因此，對當前中國的局勢，我們大槪都有這一個認識，就是此後中國政局的推移，不論黨派多至若干個，而仍須由國民黨負起領導資任。所以目前一切尋求中國和平統一的努力，只能在加强現在國民政府的前提下，纔可有所成就。愈想抬高其他黨派的地位，創弱國民政府的力量，則必愈與和平統一的期望背道而馳。其結果，則社魯門總統所期待的强固統一而民主的中國，將因蓄意奪取政權的共黨，飛揚跋扈，而遲遞不能實現。</p>
<p>我們在此地無庸指陳中國共產黨所處的地位和所抱的企圖。共產黨在世界各地都有一貫的特徵，識者自能知之。他們目前在中國的囂張氣燄，固由於國民黨步步遷就退讓，相忍爲國，而大半則由於外力的扶持。今天中國的局勢似乎又形嚴重，這局勢其實是由中國共產黨一手造成的。中國人民對於盟邦爲中國的統一和平而有的努力，自極感奮，但我們不能不率直指出，對於中共勢力的扶植，此在將來乃至目前，勢必引起遺憾的後果。這旣非中國人民的一般願望，也恐將影響到盟邦的國策，而予世界的持久和平以將來不可收拾的禍患。在這個時候，我們不得不竭誠的說出幾句老實話來。</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥在華的使命是艱難的。這個使命也許比他在參謀總長任內所負的更要艱難。此次重來返任，而當前的局勢却又如此惡化，我們傎彷彿有點無顏再見這位年高德劭的五星元帥。然以元帥的才智，我們相信沒有不能克服的困難。記得上次當馬歇爾元帥以美總統特使來華的時候，我們希望他的對於中國，一如當年拉斐德將軍對於元帥的本國一樣。無疑地當前的中國現狀乃至國際局勢，是不能與當時的情形相提並論的，馬歇爾元帥却負着一個更重要的使命，關係全人類和整個世界的前途。我們願元帥及夫人的旅居平安，願元帥使命的成功</p>
<h3>美技術情報處發見　德秘密新發明　美工業界將予採用</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十七日電〕「美國前綫技術情報處」在德國從事調查其秘密科學發明，其發現之物，均具有極重大之價値。例如：（一）磁石錄音器，係採用具有特殊磁性氧化鐵之膠質電綫，其特點爲體重極輕，一哩長之此等特種電綫，重僅一磅，若用鋼質電綫，則重達五十五磅；（二）高壓傳電法，可以傳電至距離電源六百哩之處，較普通方法增加的一倍，可用之於電傳打字機及傳聲機；（三）無綫電傳影法，係利用地底電綫從事長距離之傳影；（四）自動節制之蓄電器；（五）彩色影片攝製法，僅採用一張底片而不採用三張底片，德人並有長距離攝影曰術之發明，可隔英吉利海峽而攝製對岸情形，印出後清晰異常；（六）自煤氣中提取阿賽特林（Acetylene），此爲法本化學廠之秘密製造法。此外德人之發明中，尙有近似尼隆（Nylon）之　維質人造橡皮，新型膠木，人造燃料及潤滑油，新型合金等。在航空方面，德國黨努力研究硬炭動力之飛機引擎，試騐之時·採用每小時速率逾五千哩之人造風室，德人並發明體重極輕，速率極高，利用空氣减少熟度之柴油引擎，其海軍採用之六千匹馬力柴油引擎，效力遠在美國所採用者之上。美國前綫技術情報處所發見之科學新發明，爲數頗多，不久當一一由美國工業界予以採用。</p>

<h3>解決都市房屋問題的好機會　地政學會理事長蕭錚的談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在本市房荒聲中，中國土地改革運動領袖，中央常務委員，中國地政學會理事長藉錚氏，適因胃疾來滬醫治。記者特定訪於其病院中，叩詢對於都市房屋問題的意見，承發表談話如次二</p>
<p>一·　各大都市現在普遍閙着荒，同時因種種原因，傎正的房地產業者又普遍感受收不到正當利潤的苦悶和無法管理房屋回房屋的苦痛。在這種矛盾的現象下，正是解決都市房屋問題的好機會！</p>
<p>二·　解決的辦法，依我們土地改革的觀點，第一步應先調整現有房地關係：現在全幢出租房屋之房客或屋主，得請求政府佔價收買該項房屋及土地（如將來幣値有重大變動時，應重行佔價）。２政府由土地銀行發行債券；收買該項房地產，分爲五年至二十年償淸本息。房主得以此項價券向政府調換國營事業如鐵路，航運，工礦事業等股票。３前項經政府收買之房屋，由政府依照買價轉售於現住房客（現住房客聲明放棄者，方可另行標賣），令其按月向土地銀行繳納本息，其年限不得長於政府收買之付款年期。</p>
<p>三·依照前項辦法所得結果如次：１房客不再付不合理的租金，而是依照實價，分若干年買到住屋和土地，他必格外愛護住屋，並可實施各種改良。２房主不再僅收不合理的租余及發生不能收回資金反要出房捐及其他租稅的苦痛。他的原投資金，一次收回了有國家銀行爲担保的債券，因之可分年向土地銀行收回本息，如願掉換國營事業的股票，他的利益更厚了。３政府並不需增加發行通貨而收買許多不能管理的房屋。他只是作「中間人」，發行一種債劵，向房東保證可以按年期向國家銀行收回本息，同時向房客保證，他只需按此年期繳納購買費用，無須再有麻煩，到期便有房地產的完全所有權。政府這種措施，是調整了現在全社會的紛亂。同時以後房捐和地稅，也均有正確的依據和負責繳納者。在在我們的理論上，是不贊成收房捐的。４這種三方面有利的揹施，只是苦了二房東，他無法再以不正當的權益換取金條；同時苦了那些不正當的覇住者，他也沒有權利不付錢住房子。</p>
<p>四·這種調整現有房地關係的辦法，能不能解決房荒問題呢？這要着以下的省點：</p>
<p>１現在的房荒，並不盡是房屋不够，而是在一稱不合理的紛亂現象下，使大多數人找不到解決房屋問題的道路。現在是政府開一條大路，將現在給人覇住，或僅付最少的租錢所住的大房子拿出來正式分配，誰能付正常的代價，誰就可住合理的房子。２這種調整的結果，付不起房地價的房客，他就不能不將房子讓出來，或讓一部份出來，招人同他合夥購買房屋，或分租一些房屋來付房地價，這樣便可使沒有房子住的人得到了房子。但他無須出金條付頂費，大部份的房荒問題可以就此解決。３房主的房地產，本來呆滯住了，沒有市面，經過這個辦法可以重新活潑起來。有房地產者，表面上看起來，沒有一次收回現金的房地價，但依現値平均照十五年分攤收回，其每年收入亦不爲少數。（現在平均，一小住宅作一千五百萬元佔價，分十五年平均，每年收回一百萬，並附帶合法利息，房客每月的約付八九萬元。）百分之十五「購買年」，照平常利率說，亦不爲低。房主收回的房價，實在尙可爲新房子的投資。房主如因時下的利率高，不再爲房地產的投資，但房地產却可因這個辦法而跌價了。有能力的人，造屋自住更加容易，也就間接協助解決房荒。４也許有人疑心照這個辦法，房地產業沒有人做了，房荒或更要利害。這在我們土地改革的觀點上，認爲房地產業根本不在鼓勵之例。我們是要鼓勵「住者有其屋」。故願意政府辦土地銀行，貸款給自己造屋住的人。我們並希望以後都市有「住者合作社」來合夥蓋屋，解決共同的問題，不希望有少數大地產者，出來造大房屋租給一般市民。</p>
<p>五·　我們土地改革者對於都市方面所希望的是：「市地公有」和「住者有其屋」。現在的房屋問題，正是市地不合理使用的結果。我們以爲這個都市房屋問題不是偶然現象，而是一向存在着，只是戰後格外明顯而已。我們解決問題，不要只顧目前，只求另碎補救，我們要秉着基本原則，切實解決社會間題。所以我們認爲現在大都市的地政機關應有充分的權力來解決房屋問題及其連帶的租稅合理化等間題。同時沒有一個土地銀行，實在是一個大缺憾。政府如傎要解決這個重大社會問題——土地問題，土地銀行是必需趕快成立的。</p>

<h3>警局再三警告　債市仍然活動　昨午實行搜查　拘去七十餘人</h3>
<p>昨日統丙晨開五二五〇元光景，散戶活動，北帮助威，再創五六〇〇元高價，有關方面再三通知，不准集會，逢高稍有獲利了結者，午刻在五三五〇元左右掙抝　，中途風聲不妙，無如利令智昏，經營者不顧一切，十一時後警局實行搜捕，車載債市投機家大批以去，（男性七十人女性二人）市價始吿停頓，如以最後之價計，較前收各債均稍吿漲，華股交易亦數度停頓，最初最高計永紗五一八〇元，美亞四三五〇元，景福四三五元，盤旋而下，午前永紗退至四九三〇元，美亞四一三〇元，景福四一五元而後稍定，午收較前收計永紗等熱門均見微跌，較冷各股形勢平定，元老股仍屬賣盤居多，午後喊價稍高，外股昨求供均衡，浮多續有了結，上塲不見佳妙，會德豐二二〇〇〇元成交，人心恍惚，怡紗英聯同在前收價掙扎，游資充斥，迨市價轉定，熱門怡紗英聯遂較多買戶，業廣仍由業中大有吸收，亞洲有證券幫散戶助威，是以上述各股近午都見堅穩，餘均不過如此而已，午收結果計怡紗英聯亞洲業廣稍漲，餘平平。</p>
<h3>金價微升</h3>
<p>烚市昨形平穩，趨勢多盤，銀根奇　，中途稍見振作，美鈔助長買氣，但以一般心理對金市前途不作過高奢望，漲後多脫手之流，晨開在一五一萬光景，開後會破一五〇萬關，廣帮吸納少許，不久漸漸回上，中行配售仍按原價，無人需求，投機範圍日狹，擁資者不易拆出，低價較多買戶，美鈔奇緊，午前曾回升至一五五萬而後始平，午刻在一五三萬左右，午後復多了結者，曾吿小挫，銀樓實銷稍殷，最後平穩，結果較前收微升一萬，飾金十六萬八，紋銀一千五，銀元仍吿平庸，暗拆銀根更濫，息價祗一角二分至一角半，擁資者尙感難覓對手。</p>
<h3>美鈔銷路多</h3>
<p>大票交割有困難</p>
<p>外幣美鈔以不合格之進一口貨仍多需用，求過於供，一般心理對美鈔咸抱希冀，洋行方面亦多出金換鈔者，加之百元大鈔交割不通用，錢兌業愿貼出七十元尙無受主，以致籌碼奇涸，自晨初二千元關邊逐漸步昇，午前見二〇六五元高價，午刻在二〇五〇元左右徘徊，午後稍見軟化，結果較前收回升二十元，港票平平，買戶並未見湧，老貨雖平，新貨回跌五元，羅比五百元，港票四百元，均屬供過於求。</p>
<h3>米價大漲</h3>
<p>昨米市以內地猛漲，成本加高，售心益堅，申銷轉暢，粳秈元米均一致上漲三千元有强，麵粉亦隨米價上升二三百元，黃豆亦加三五百元，生仁暗緊，豆餅再漲四五百元，惟收市則漸漸軟化，麩皮尙覺平穩，油市存到兩有，欲振乏力，略加千元，各糧均隨米價上升。</p>
<h3>紗花交易平淡</h3>
<p>昨日紗市稍形回下，北帮對中型紗略有進一胃，其餘客路殊少動辦，人心已不及上日之興奮，同行求售者較夥，因小型廠現貨供應不充，故價尙不致狂瀉，念支紗平均約小二萬上下，錢價平平，獨卅二支雙股收市做一百念二萬元，跌落六萬之多，昨又屆紡建開紗例期，標售紗錢品名有廿八種之多，開價大致與上期相仿，僅四十二支雙股綫略低一二萬元，市上所亟需之廿支紗十六支均付闕如。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉報小三五磅音，計近期美金二七·六〇，遠期二七·六二，米特林現貨二八·一一，本埠現棉市况尙穩定，惟交易無甚進展，僅申新第六廠進太倉花二百餘包，均同業互做交易居多，紡建公司仍未採辦。</p>

<h3>安全理事會側影　中國擁護聯合國共同利益　決不是跟踪在英美背後跑</h3>
<p>— 四月一日航訊　本報駐美特約記者毛樹清寄</p>
<p>聯合國安全理事會開會第四天，我坐的「威廉瑪麗號」戰艦，方從從法國海岸駛進紐約。新大陸對我，一切都是「新」的，正如同新的國際和平廟堂，還捉摸不着新的會址一樣。</p>
<p>理事會在紐約北市郊亨特學院開會，從市中心區的四十二號街，坐地下車去參加，要走半小時以上，而且還得在一四九號街換一次車。亭特學院幾座整齊的建築，孤零零的站立在郊外，五十一國聯合國的國旗，從倫敦中央大廈的屋頂上，搬移到了亨特學院正中的草坪上。</p>
<p>會塲的警衛，比倫敦更爲森嚴，出入要經過四次檢查，穿便衣的檢查員，和憲兵站在一起，像是聯邦偵探局的秘密警察。愛更斯小姐，依然是大會的新聞部主任，她是從倫敦『移交』過來的國際新聞官之一。</p>
<p>葛羅米珂退出會塲</p>
<p>刊載大幅照片</p>
<p>新聞王國對這次國際的重要集會，可以說是卜了百分之百的動員令。一月間，在倫敦開聯合國大會的時候，倫敦各報依然是日出一大張，因之，許多詳細的記載和精彩的描寫，都不免掛一漏萬。讀報的人，也不能够完全過癱。那時候，有一批紐約報紙，從美國用專機裝到倫敦，雖然慢點，大家還是搶着看。這次紐的開會，美國新聞界認爲是表現的最好機會，照片·圖畫·描寫。評論。那怕是會塲上一顆針掉在地下，報紙都認爲是記載的量好材料，葛羅米珂星期三退出會塲的那天，紐約日報登載了幾十頁大幅照片，從葛羅米珂辯論失敗，挺胸站起來，旋轉身體，開步走，貝爾納斯兩眼望着他，乃至於步出大門，上汽車，國領事館，每一側動作，都有照片刋出，一大羣記者，那天一直跟在葛羅米珂後面走，糾緾到半夜兩點鐘。葛羅米珂弄得不耐煩極了，一再的答復他們：『沒有什麼可以說的，你們回去好了，如果莫期科有電報指示，我會打電話通知你們的，妤了，請回去吧！』記者們還是跟着他不走。半夜兩點鐘了，葛羅米珂再也忍耐不下去，力竭聲嘶的說：『你們爲什麽這樣蠢，我現在要睡覺了』。記者們慢慢散開。有位紐約郵報的名外勁記者歐文。黎勃曼先生，那天到黎明才國家，第二天早上，這位記者又出現在蘇聯領事館，他要葛羅米珂回答他的問題，那怕是說一個字也好。</p>
<p>以蘇聯爲頭條新聞</p>
<p>以大紅字刊登</p>
<p>一直到現在，蘇聯不出席會議已經四天了，許多記者還是追踪着葛羅米珂，許多報紙，仍然以蘇聯的動態作爲頭條新聞。『美洲新聞』晚報，每天以紅字寫大標題，刋出蘇聯的動向，新判行而言論略略偏左的紐約下午報，特別用最系統的文字，說明許多問題的來蹤去跡。美國是言論自由登峯造極的國家，他們的言論和時評，都是極客觀，極合理的分析，像村婦駡街式的咒駡，或者冷嘲熱諷之類，非常少見。</p>
<p>很少的情形，也的略看到，例如有幾個刋物，說伊朗問題是『英美少數油礦資本家的陰謀，』說『貝爾納斯的後台老國，是伊朗油田的投資者，』還說『阿拉（伊朗請願代表）本身是一個伊朗的油田買辦』之類，但像這樣無中生有的詆哉，畢竟是少數。</p>
<p>據大會新聞部的一位職員吿訴我：紐約市以及各埠各國駐紐約的記者，請求旁聽的，總共有八百多人，新聞記者的旁聽坐位，不過三百多張椅子，因之，有很多被直接擋駕，有很多祗發入塲證，不發會塲坐次證。愛更斯小姐帶我進會塲的那天，看到許多美國同業，站在門外伸頭探腦，這些人便是屬於後一類的。</p>
<p>記者們坐彈簧座椅</p>
<p>像在戲院一樣</p>
<p>會塲的本身，固然此倫敎的中央大厦小得多多，但實際新聞記者席，並不亞於倫敦，倫敦的大會，是五十一個國家開會，代表，顧問，秘書，隨員的座次多。這次理事會僅十一個國家開會，唱戲的人少，聽戲的人多。我說他們在『唱戲』，事實上，也確像唱戲。不是嗎？粉紅色的牆璧，明暗隨時在管制調動的燈光，聲音適度的擴音器，乃至於記者先生們坐的彈簧座椅，都像在戲院一樣，會塲的空氣，有時候嚴肅，有時候俏皮，有時候鴉雀無聲，有時候合上台下相互哄堂大笑。莎士比亞說：世界本是一座舞台，外交家便是直接出台的主角。</p>
<p>譬如有一次，他們討論到向蘇聯伊朗徵詢全部事件的報吿，貝爾納斯的原提案，是限於四月二日早上十一點鐘，澳洲及波蘭代表主張改爲四月三日上午十一點鐘。法國代表附和澳波的意見，他的補充理由是：今天我們討論這一問題，在紐約是三月二十九日，在莫斯科東歐時間，已經是三月三十日，為顧全事實需要計，應延長一天至四月三日。貝爾納斯緊接着說：我說的四月二日，在莫斯科東歡時間，已經是四月三日，因之以不改爲宜，全塲哄堂大笑，秃頂的墨西哥代表很稱現實，他說：就算四月三日好了，看蘇聯的樣子，能在四月四日送來，已經算是好的。埃及代表也是此意，最後郭復初主席很端重的說：就算四月三日，大會決定限期至四月三日上午十一時以前，請兩國將報吿送到。也沒有舉手投票，就作爲正式通過。</p>
<p>單槍匹馬關琪　戰</p>
<p>從不正面開砲</p>
<p>伊朗問題發生以後，唯一投附和蘇聯票的，祗有波蘭代表蘭琪，蘇聯葛羅米珂不出席伊朗問題討論以後，蘭琪成爲單槍匹馬應戰的局面，這位儀表瀟洒，舉止自然，常常穿紫黑西服的外交官，較之上次倫敦大會時的波蘭外長强得多，他說話很淸楚，也很婉轉，他從不正面開砲得罪人，對員爾納斯提相反意見，每次總得　上一個圈子，先說原則上贊同，再說修正之處，甚至修正到完全相反。他常常笑臉四週張望，除了坐在他旁邊的澳洲代表以外，很少有人還給他任何『笑臉』，波蘭的織境是够可憐的，可憐到他自已也明白。</p>
<p>像倫敦聯合國大會的時候一樣；會塲通用英法兩種文字，倫敦開會的時候，法國，比利時，埃及，烏克蘭的代表，都說法文。這回除了法國代表以外，幾乎全用的英文，但是，郭復初主席，每次必非常有次序的命令『翻譯』。蘇聯和埃及代表這次都說英文，都很流利和鏗鏘，每次代表發言的時候，燈光特別『照明』，翻譯的時候，燈光照在馬蹄形中間的翻譯席上。</p>
<p>兩位新舊美國務卿</p>
<p>步調整齊一致</p>
<p>貝爾納斯這次因伊朋問題，美國態度非常堅決，特地從華府趕去親自參加。他講話淸晰沉着，不像在倫敦時候的有『沙聲』或發顫抖。斯退丁紐斯坐在他旁邊，一言不發。這兩位新舊美國國務卿，都是外交家的健將，他們的作風雖有不同，但他們的步調和意見，始終是齊一的。有一次，貝爾納斯說話，忘了放擴音器，斯退丁紐斯很快端到他面前。他們常常一起出人會塲，美國記者們替他們倆攝了很多『亦步亦趨』的鏡頭。</p>
<p>紐約兩大國際盛會</p>
<p>中國榮庸主席</p>
<p>紐約的兩大國際盛會上，中國都榮贗主席，（安全理事會和國際軍事參謀會議）商啓予將軍對會議的原則，跟郭復初先生一樣，我們以擁護聯合國的共同利益為宗旨。因之，無論從任何一個角度來看，國際間都相當尊重中國，至少，我們在今日國際上，沒有特殊的死敵。安全理事會中國代表團，有一次招待在紐約的中國新聞記者，有位華僑日報的記者，詢問郭代表：中國是否跟在英美後面跑？郭復初先生鄭重答復他：中國擁護聯合國的共同利益，遵守聯合國憲章，決沒有眼在任何人後面跑。</p>
<p>也許那位記者對某些問題，持具偏見，好好一個記者招待會，彼此弄到面紅耳赤。第二天，另一張紐約僑報，——美洲日報上刋載招待會的新聞上說：『……華僑日報記者徐某，於招待會上公開詆毀國民政府，引起全塲記者之不滿」。</p>
<p>許多人怕見新聞記者，新聞記者本身，似乎也應該有所檢點。郭泰祺代表那天很感慨：『我們中國人自已尙且如此，還叫我有什麽話說？』（四月一日）</p>
<p>迎賓館中建築中</p>
<p>美國兵監視德戰犯在布萊梅海文建築迎賓館，以備收容美佔領軍的家屬。在各美軍佔領區內，凡有丈夫或父親駐剳在那裏的，婦孺都可隨往。</p>

<p>自由談　婦女與家庭特輯</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>女兒態</h3>
<p>— 聰雋</p>
<p>在封建社會裏，生爲一個女人，好像必須有一種特殊的形態，因爲重男輕女的原故，男女之問就被分出很大的差別來，好像女人總是女人，女人和男人在語言，舉止，態度，好尙等方面就好像不得不有差別。於是一般人心目中的女人總是文靜的，溫柔的，繼弱的，害羞的，沈默的，寡歡的，端淑的，多愁的，善病的。原來封建社會的女性，處於男子的隸屬地位，沒有獨立的人格，一切的評價全以男子一方的主觀的需求爲限，而女人也須在這種環境中養成體貼，順從，忍辱，溫純的個性。</p>
<p>這種女性特殊個性的養成，可說完全由於社會環境。因爲在男性處於支配者的地位，他們所希求的女性一定是具備那些個性。由個性再表現於形態，自然也偏向溫柔端淑的一面。古時文人筆下的女性，都寫得那樣纖弱多愁的，沈默寡言的。假如有一個女人在廣座中縱談自若，盡量發抒其情緒，那一定要被人視『潑刺』，而在男人則不然，他有權利可以說他要說的和想說的，他有權利可以表露他的情感。由傳統的社會環境所塑造成黨陶成的「女兒態」，無形中限制了女人情感的發洩，思想的表達。</p>
<p>舊社會所傳留下來的「女兒態」的型式，是消極的，病態的，頽廢的，衰沈的。從「女兒態」所表現的是一種矯糅造作的不自然的態度和儀表，聲音放得特別低，動作做得特別文雅，正常的情緒反不能適宜地發洩，因而造成心理的變態。有時無病還得裝點病，不咳嗽還得來幾聲咳嗽，紅樓夢裏的林黛玉便可作爲這類「女兒態」的典型代表人物。</p>
<p>照現代進步的思想來說，舊社會的這種「女兒態」，不該再存在於新女性中間了。我們評判女性美的標準和以前有種種不同。從前人以爲多愁善感型的女人是美的，但現代人的眼光根本兩樣，多愁善感的女性是病態的，並不合於美的條件。現代女性最重要的就是要有一個健康的身心，强壯，結實，能適當地發抒情感，妥善地適應生活，態度要大方，舉止要自然，不自卑，也不自高。想說的要說就說，想做的要做的就做。處於男子之中，不自認爲「我是一個女性」，不存「他是男人我是女人」的觀念，尊重自已獨立的人格，以純潔的心和高尙的行爲處世接物。</p>
<p>至於女性的一般的溫柔，沈着，端淑的性格，我們自然也不能一概加以抹殺，我們並不反對女人以體貼入微的心情去愛她的丈夫，我們更不反對女人以溫和親切的態度去愛她的子女，女性性格上所流露的特殊優美之處，我們應該保留她，但我們却不同意讓女人抑制她的情感，無條件的甘受屈辱而不反抗，在任何情形下一味的順從，變成和綿羊似的。我們反對裝腔作勢的「女見態」，我們希望女性所表現於外的形態（當然內心的思想，決定外面的形態。）自然而適宜，大方而中度，活潑而康樂。</p>
<p>當代史學家陳衡哲女士說過：「新時代的女性，一方面固應保持她的性人格，而另一方面也應表露她的個性。」封建勢力籠軍下的被壓迫的女性，缺少的便是陳先生所說的「個性」，女人的「個性」之不同，正如男子「個性』之不同。舊社會的環境所塑造出來的女性，從那種「女兒態上表現的是一個模型造出來的，當然沒有「個性」之可言。</p>
<p>社會變動了，時代轉向新的一頁，我們希望從新女性所表現的「女兒態」，是充滿着積極進取的精神，高尙優美的個性，不做一個女人則罷，否則一定要能說敢說，能做敢做，能笑敢笑，能駡敢駡！養在玻璃暖房中作男人做玩物的女性，那種弱不禁風的「女兒態」，那種忍聲呑氣不敢說不敢做的「女兒態」，那種一味遷就男人順從男人把自已的地位忘記了，一天到晚只知討男人歡心的「女兒態」我們願意從此被新時代的狂瀾所淘汰！</p>
<h3>姑嫂歌</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「長烟袋，短荷包，</p>
<p>我是媽媽慣嬌嬌，</p>
<p>我是爹爹龍寳貝，</p>
<p>我是哥哥親妹妹。</p>
<p>嫂嫂說我不下田，</p>
<p>能在家中過幾年？</p>
<p>嫂嫂說我不栽葱，</p>
<p>能在家裏過幾冬？</p>
<p>拿過　兒　一　，</p>
<p>我在家中二年整；</p>
<p>拿過算盤算一算，</p>
<p>我在家中二年半。』</p>
<p>這是一首大家庭中姑嫂間的歌謠。在這首歌謠裏，我們可以看出中國家庭間姑嫂間不能合作，和互相仇視的情形來，所以，如何改善中國的家庭制度？以及怎樣調和大家庭中姑嫂間不和睦的空氣？這也是一個値得研究，値得討論的問題。</p>

<h3>毛筍的出產地</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>這幾天市上小菜，算毛筍最便宜，只買二三百元一斤；因其來源多也。上海吃的毛筍，紅榖的由杭州來，可是不多；黃榖的由寗波來，佔市上什之七八成。</p>
<p>在寗波產筍最盛的地方叫「烏嚴」，在鄞西去城六十里之遙。那地處祟山中，係四明山脈，高出海面當在千尺以上。有住戶千餘，並有一街一條，出賣日用品，供當地需要。山上有大巖石一，大可數十丈，因甬西所有烏鴉，日中往外覓食，夜間回此巖周圍休息，故稱『烏巖』。該村爲翁姓毛姓居多，故亦稱「翁巖」。在烏巖四　數十里內，種的都是毛竹，可謂「中無雜樹」，因此那地用毛竹造屋，用竹葉竹枝當柴燒，一切用具，以竹器居多。一年四季，靠竹的生產：春有毛筍，夏秋有鞭筍，冬有冬筍；再另砍毛竹，背至廿里外的鳳　市或陸家埠出售，換購一切，解決衣食住行。</p>
<p>那兒產的毛筍，較他地鮮美，原爲數千只烏鴉夜宿烏巖竹林中，遺糞竹林，增加肥料所致。因此當地居民，對烏鴉很優待，禁止槍殺捕捉，正當牠衣食父母般看待呢！</p>
<p>做筍生意的，在那村有坐莊，專收毛筍。收了筍後，僱人挑至鳳　市筍船，當晚開出，第二天到達寗波江厦，再運至輪船，第三天到上海。因此上海人吃的毛筍，最新鮮的也要三天，若逢輪船脫班，說不定五七天以上，他們筍販十，把筍浸在水中，防其易老，因此無論如何，上海人是吃不着新鮮毛筍的。</p>
<p>筍有大年小年，普通每隔一年是大年，也有隔二年三年的。</p>
<p>毛筍有時節，過了時節，便成毛竹。在產期旺盛時，由各筍廠大量購買，製成罐頭筍，寗波如生筍廠，便是首創者。</p>

<h3>Encountering Strong Winds, Flying for Nine Hours: Marshall Arrives in Beiping from Tokyo, President Chiang and Wife Await Meeting in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 17th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife arrived in Beiping at 6:35 PM on the 17th, flying from Tokyo. The journey took nine hours. The large, four-engine transport plane, which originated from Washington, took a total of four days to reach China. Mr. Marshall was greeted at the Xiyuan Airport in Beiping by representative Gillem, U.S. member of the Military Mediation Department Robertson, and several important officials from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Mr. Marshall, looking slightly fatigued after the long journey, immediately drove to the U.S. Embassy upon disembarking. Discussions regarding the tense situation in China are expected. It is anticipated that Mr. Marshall will continue his flight to the provisional capital on the 18th, accompanied by Gillem. During the flight from Tokyo to Beiping, Mr. Marshall's plane encountered strong winds, delaying the flight by four hours. Special Envoy Marshall returned to the U.S. on the 11th of last month to report on his duties. His direct flight here today to first consult with the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters and then proceed to Chongqing is of great significance.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to China today, flying directly to Beiping to hear a direct report from Representative Gillem regarding the situation in the Northeast. The Kuomintang and Communist representatives of the military three-person group returned to Chongqing this afternoon, indicating little progress in resolving the war in the Northeast. Leaders in the provisional capital are speculating on what instructions Mr. Marshall is carrying after his discussions in Washington. Most observers anticipate that Mr. Marshall is carrying strict demands: (1) a ceasefire in the Northeast, and (2) a peaceful resolution to the political dispute. According to observers, fulfilling the above demands is necessary if China hopes to continue receiving active assistance from the United States in resolving its problems.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service Beiping, 17th] Qin Decun (Chen Cheng's representative) and Luo Ruiqing (Zhou Enlai's representative) flew back to Chongqing this morning with their staff. Lieutenant General Gillem will remain in Beiping and return to Chongqing with Marshal at the same time.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 17th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen notified the Nanjing office of his department today that his originally scheduled arrival in Nanjing from the provisional capital on the 20th has been changed to the 24th. This is because he is accompanying President Chiang to Nanjing, and the President will not be able to depart on the 20th. Whether the 24th is feasible will depend on the outcome of President Chiang's discussions with Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, flew back to the provisional capital from Shanghai this afternoon. President Chiang personally went to the airport to greet her. Madame Chiang's return is likely to prepare for welcoming Mrs. Marshall in the provisional capital.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. is about to issue a declaration regarding the renewed civil war in China. According to Secretary of State Byrnes, Special Envoy Marshall will report on the situation in China in the near future, at which point the U.S. government will make a statement. However, the details of the statement were not disclosed.</p>
<h3>Large Parts of the City Occupied by Communist Troops, Nationalist Troops Fight Fiercely in Changchun, Morale Boosted by Airdrops Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 17th] Du Yuming is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 18th to direct military affairs. Mr. Du bid farewell to the Beiping press at 4:00 PM on the 17th. It is reported that Liang Huasheng has gone to Sipingjie to command, while Zheng Dongguo has gone to Changtu for inspection.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] According to a certain military expert, the disparity in numbers between the Nationalist and Communist forces north of Shenyang is significant. Furthermore, the Nationalist troops must consider the suffering of the people of the Northeast in every action, leading to a difficult situation for some outstanding young soldiers who are defending the sovereignty of the Northeast. Currently, the Nationalist troops do not intend to use paratroopers to reinforce Changchun. It is also heard that the vanguard of the New First Army was only one day's journey from Changchun yesterday. After urgent repairs, the Beining Railway was barely passable yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 16th] Communist troops attacking Changchun have penetrated deep into various parts of the city. The security forces and other government personnel defending Changchun are concentrated in one corner, struggling to resist. This is according to this morning's report. Additionally, Nationalist troops advancing north passed Sipingjie and this morning advanced to a point 100 kilometers from Changchun. If the defenders of Changchun can hold out for three days, the Nationalist troops should arrive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 17th, 11:00 AM] The defending troops of Changchun have been fighting fiercely for twelve hours. Most of the city area has fallen into the hands of the Communist troops. Although our troops are short of ammunition, their morale remains high. Airdrops received on the 17th boosted morale. It is estimated that the Communist troops attacking Changchun have been continuously reinforced and now outnumber our forces by tenfold, and their firepower is significantly superior. Confirmed news: Nationalist troops advancing north crossed Sipingjie on the 15th and are advancing at full speed.</p>
<p>[United Press Changchun, 16th] Nationalist troops lost the only train station in Changchun today. The Yamato Hotel, located 200 yards from the train station and managed by the Soviets, can no longer be contacted by telephone. According to the last message sent by Major Riggs and Sergeant Ponte, who reside in the Yamato Hotel, a bullet passed through their room, but neither was injured. Currently, the Changchun Mayor's residence is under gunfire, where five American journalists reside. Yesterday, Soviet planes flew low over Changchun, but did not land at the Communist-held airfield.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen stated to reporters on the 17th that the civil war will not spread beyond the Northeast. The CCP only needs to abide by the ceasefire and other agreements. The CCP's attack on Changchun is inappropriate from any point of view. The Nationalist troops stationed in Changchun, consisting of 2,000 regular troops and 2,000 security forces, are being pressed by over 30,000 Communist troops, and their defense area has clearly shrunk. Nationalist troops advanced north after recovering Sipingjie on the 15th of this month. Wu denied the rumor that the government intended to use transport planes carrying officials to Nanjing to transport large numbers of fresh troops to Changchun. It is understood that the three airfields in Changchun have fallen into the hands of the Communist troops, making it impossible to airlift reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang, 16th] Nationalist troops continue to advance north beyond Sipingjie. The Communist Party's newspaper, Xinhua Daily, published inaccurate news that "government troops suffered severe blows from the so-called 'Northeast Democratic Allied Army' in the Benxi area and north of Changtu, and that Zheng Mingxin, deputy commander of the 52nd Army, and Liu Shimou, commander of the 25th Division, were killed, and Long Tianwu, commander of the 14th Division, was injured." Military authorities dismissed this with a smile.</p>
<p>[United Press Tianjin, 17th] According to Nationalist military sources today, Communist forces are besieging the Shanhaiguan area. The headquarters of the 94th Army stated that troops from the 5th Division have been dispatched to a village northeast of Shanhaiguan to repel the Communist forces attacking the area. It is understood that on April 12th, a regiment of Nationalist engineering troops was surrounded northeast of Shanhaiguan. It is reported that Communist forces are attacking an area 20 miles northeast of Shanhaiguan. Nationalist military sources say that roughly nine miles of railway southwest of that location are in the hands of Communist forces. It is also known that several hundred Communist soldiers were attacking a small village 30 miles northeast of Tangshan a few days ago, but were forced to retreat after Nationalist reinforcements arrived. Other reports also stated that two regiments of Communist troops were operating within a few miles northwest of Tangshan.</p>
<h3>Measures for Managing Banks: Approved by the Executive Yuan with Revisions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 17th] The Ministry of Finance's measures for managing banks have been approved by the Executive Yuan with revisions. The full text, consisting of 27 articles, will be promulgated and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Government Representatives and Various Parties Continued to Reorganize the Government Yesterday; No Agreement Reached in Special Meeting</h3>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Government representatives met with representatives from the Communist Party and the Democratic League last night but failed to reach any agreement. The primary reason was the critical situation in the Northeast. The special meeting, convened by President Chiang, was said to be a final effort to complete the final reorganization of the government before April 20th. Attendees included Communist representative Zhou Enlai and Democratic League leader Luo Longji. The outcome of the meeting has not been announced. However, according to Luo Longji, the Democratic League will refuse to join the coalition government unless the Kuomintang accepts the following four demands: (1) The civil war should be stopped immediately. (2) The Democratic League must know in advance who will be the Premier of the new government and what his policies will be. (3) President Chiang's promise of China's "Four Freedoms" must be implemented. (4) The Communist Party should have ten seats on the National Government Committee, and the Democratic League should have four, so that the representatives of the two parties united together can ensure a veto power in the meeting. As of now, the government has proposed eight seats for the Communist Party and four for the Democratic League. Luo also said: "We have tried our best to compromise, and General Marshall may be able to assist. However, the government is still rapidly transporting troops and supplies to the Northeast, intensifying the war." He continued: Government representatives insist that the Three-Person Group must resolve the ceasefire issue, but the Democratic League will not join the new government while the civil war continues.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Government representatives held talks with representatives of the Youth Party today, hoping to reach an agreement on political issues such as government reorganization, but no detailed information was released other than that little progress had been made. Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen said: He knows that the Comprehensive Subcommittee has reached an agreement in principle on the difficult issue of drafting a constitution and hopes that the provisions will be written down. Wu believes that a compromise has been reached, but since there may still be disputes in the future, he did not disclose the details. It is understood that the Kuomintang has decided to limit the number of Communist seats on the National Government Committee to eight.</p>
<h3>Special Investigation of Traitors Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun Completed; To Be Sent to Nanjing for Trial According to Judicial Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] Chongqing News, The traitors Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun, detained in Tuqiao, are still guarded by the Military Intelligence Bureau and will be sent to Nanjing within a week. It is reported that the military's investigation of the two traitors Zhou and Ding has been largely completed. After being sent to Nanjing, they will be handed over to the Capital Higher Court for trial. It is said that the Higher Court has been ordered to accept the case. In the past, there have been various rumors about the two traitors Zhou and Ding in Chongqing and Shanghai, and the following questions have been raised: (1) The government has now begun to return to the capital. Will the two traitors Zhou and Ding return to the capital with the government? (2) If they need to be sent to Nanjing, when will they be sent and why has it been delayed for so long? (3) Will they be sent to Nanjing for further investigation? Judging from the above news, it can be understood that the special investigation work on the two traitors Zhou and Ding has been completed and will soon enter the judicial process for trial.</p>
<h3>Six Traitors, Including Mei Siping, Transferred to the Capital Higher Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th Special Dispatch] The former puppet Minister of Internal Affairs Mei Siping, the former puppet Minister of Education Li Shengwu, the former puppet Minister of Industry Chen Junhui, the former puppet Minister of Social Affairs Peng Nian, the former puppet Vice Minister of Political Affairs Wang Hanzhang, and the former puppet Military Affairs Committee member Peng Ximing, have been investigated and transferred to the Capital Higher Court for custody. According to the person in charge of eliminating traitors in the Army Headquarters, Mei Siping, during his tenure as puppet "Minister of Internal Affairs," recklessly amended laws, launched clearing campaigns, and harmed living beings, and his crimes are confirmed. Li Shengwu, when he was the puppet Minister of Education, changed the education system and implemented slave education. His crime is no less than that of Mei Siping. Both criminals have been interrogated many times, and their confessions and records fill several volumes, and they will be severely punished. It is learned that the Higher Court will hold a public trial before the 25th. In addition, the Capital District Court arrested the traitors Li Shangqing, Ding Boxiang, Pan Wenyu, Chen Deyan, Hu Baocheng, Tang Debao, Wang Guirong, and others. The court's prosecutor's office has completed the investigation, and yesterday sent police to escort the traitor Li Shangqing and others to the Suzhou Higher Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Traitor Qi Xieyuan Sent to Beiping; To Be Subject to Military Trial</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin, 16th] The major traitor Qi Xieyuan, who was arrested in Tianjin, was sent to Beiping at 10:20 AM on the 16th. Because Qi Xieyuan is a military officer, he will be tried by the Military Law Supervision Department of the Beiping Appeasement Headquarters. Other traitors detained by military agencies in Tianjin will also be sent to the court for trial in the near future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 16th] The traitors arrested in Beiping, as instructed by President Chiang and reported by the public, are being investigated and tried by the Hebei Higher Court.

The evidence of their aiding the enemy and harming the country is conclusive. Starting from the 17th, they will be transferred to the Hebei Court in batches along with the case files for public trial. The court has prepared to use the Yaojiajing First Model Prison as the place to detain these important traitors.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 17th] Miao Bin, the former Deputy Speaker of the Puppet Legislative Yuan, was sentenced to death by the Jiangsu Higher Court. The court order stated that if he did not accept the judgment, he could apply for a retrial. Recently, the Higher Court stated that Miao's application for a retrial has been returned and will be forwarded to the Supreme Court for review. It is said that the reasons are two: (1) He surrendered to the Capital Military Bureau immediately after the victory and should be given a reduced sentence in accordance with the surrender regulations. (2) He claimed that the Higher Court adopted a "special strategy to fatten" the case and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhou Weiding Sentenced to Five Years; Anhui Traitors Sent to Higher Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 17th] The legislative member Zhou Wei, since being arrested and sent to the Higher Court, after the completion of the prosecution by the Higher Prosecutor's Office, the trial was concluded by Court President Shi Meiyu, and the judgment was made yesterday on the 17th. At 2 PM, Court President Shi and other judges ascended to the first court, summoned the traitor to court, briefly questioned him, and then stood up to read the main text of the judgment: Zhou Wei colluded with enemy countries and plotted to resist this country, sentenced to five years imprisonment, deprived of public rights for five years.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] Bengbu News, The puppet Anhui Political Affairs Director Fan E, puppet Finance Director Tang Shaohou, puppet Provincial Party Committee Supervisor Hu Shian, puppet Autonomous Council Standing Committee member Zhang Jinyu, puppet Wuhe County Chief He Zhenyang, and eight other major and minor traitors have been transferred to a branch of the Anhui Higher Court for trial. In addition, the puppet Jiashan Daily, a cultural traitor from Anhui, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a branch court.</p>
<h3>Former Puppet Manchukuo Ambassador to Germany: Yunnan Higher Court to Hold Public Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kunming, 17th] The former puppet Manchukuo Ambassador to Germany, Lü Yiwen, and the editor of the Overseas Chinese Daily, Huang Nong, who was in charge of the puppet embassy in Germany, have been imprisoned in the Kunming Military Prison for a month. The Yunnan Higher Court has completed its first interrogation and is scheduled to hold a public trial for Huang Nong on the 17th and a public trial for Lü Yiwen on the 30th. According to the Yunnan Higher Court's indictment, Lü is currently 44 years old, from Jin County, Liaoning Province. He graduated from Meiji University in Japan in the sixth year of the Republic of China. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, he served as the Director of the Trade Department of the Puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then served as the Governor of the Puppet Tonghua Province. In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic of China, he served as the Puppet Manchukuo Ambassador to Germany. On February 17th of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Germany was defeated, and Lü fled to Salzgitter in West Germany. On May 28th of the same year, he was captured and imprisoned by British soldiers. On August 17th of the same year, he was sent to the Gardelegen concentration camp. On December 3rd, he was sent to Paris. The Chinese Embassy in France sent police to escort him to Hanoi, Vietnam. Our First Front Army then sent him from that army to the Yunnan Higher Court on March 16th of this year for investigation.

<h3>Results of Japanese General Election Approved by MacArthur; A Dispute During the Four-Power Control Council Meeting; Clear Response to Soviet Accusations</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 17th Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency] MacArthur has approved the results of this Japanese general election. Therefore, Ichiro Hatoyama, leader of the victorious Liberal Party, will become the first Prime Minister of a democratic Japan. MacArthur's representative read MacArthur's statement at this morning's Four-Power Control Council meeting, opening the way for the long-standing political deadlock in Japan to be broken. However, this statement has been met with some frustration, especially among Allied reporters. These Allied reporters have severely criticized Hatoyama due to his past political history.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 17th Dispatch from the United Press] At today's meeting of the Control Council for Japan, Whitney, an official from MacArthur's headquarters, sharply responded to Soviet representative Derevyanko's questions regarding the effectiveness of MacArthur's headquarters' purge orders. It was stated that the Japanese government has been quite prompt in complying with various purge orders and occupation policies, and that all information regarding the implementation of the purge orders can be provided to the Soviet Union. The Soviet accusation that certain undesirable elements in Japan have not been removed merely copied recent reports in Soviet newspapers. Since the Soviet representative or other representatives of the Control Council have not sought this information from MacArthur's headquarters, they are unaware of the extent to which Japan has implemented the purge orders. The Soviet criticism that the normal progress of democracy in Japan has been hindered is also outdated since it occurred before the election results were announced. If Derevyanko could carefully observe the Japanese people's participation in the election, he would not make such hasty judgments. However, it is still a long way off before Japan can complete its democratic politics, but they should be trusted to have this intention. In conclusion, the election on the 10th of this month was a democratic expression, proving that the Japanese people are neither left-leaning nor right-leaning, and the United Nations' occupation policy can be trusted in this regard.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 16th Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Another fifteen representatives from our country dispatched to the Allied Council for Japan arrived here last night. There were already twenty-seven personnel from our country dispatched to the Allied Council for Japan a few days ago.</p>

<h3>Receiving a Special Correspondent from the Newspaper, Shidehara Discusses Sino-Japanese Relations; Past Mistakes Were Made by Japanese Militarists; Praises President Chiang's Magnanimity</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 17th Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] This newspaper's special correspondent "visited" Prime Minister Shidehara at his residence yesterday for an hour. The reporter asked if he would submit his resignation after the general election, and Shidehara replied that he had not yet decided. The reporter then asked if there would be changes in the cabinet, and Shidehara replied that this matter would have to be decided by MacArthur. Regarding the general election, Shidehara provided the following detailed account: I went to a polling place not far from my residence and saw enthusiastic and orderly participants, including women. I was very interested in this. The reporter then inquired about the anti-Shidehara government movement of the crowd last Sunday. He said that the participants were not demonstrators, but rather a rabble. The reporter immediately retorted, "There were as many as 70,000 people at the scene at the time. Are they all a rabble?" Shidehara originally listened, remaining silent, only offering a bitter smile with a look that was neither crying nor laughing.</p>
<p>The reporter asked about the future of Sino-Japanese relations. Shidehara said that China and Japan must move forward hand in hand. This policy was advocated by himself fifteen years ago, but there were many obstacles at the time, so it was not successful. Most of these obstacles were created by Japanese soldiers, but some were also caused by the Chinese government. For example, when he was Prime Minister, he sent a special envoy to China, but he was rejected. In addition, the Chinese government failed to quickly resolve the incidents that occurred in Manchuria. At that time, a Japanese military officer who had been permitted by the Chinese government to conduct an investigation in Manchuria was suddenly killed, creating tension between the two countries. Japanese people held a rally to oppose his pro-China policy. At that time, he discussed the tense situation between the two countries with Wang Rongshi, the Chinese minister to Japan. The reporter asked if the Manchurian Incident was created by Japanese militarists. Sun Yuan did not answer, only saying that in any case, China and Japan must cooperate closely in the future.</p>
<p>Shidehara also said that after Japan surrendered, Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech that deeply moved him. That speech not only secured the safety of Japanese residents in China, but also gave them extremely friendly treatment. This is the greatness of China. The Sino-Japanese relationship is sincere and pleasant, and the future is limitless. President Chiang's magnanimity is inspiring.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Welcoming Marshal Marshall Back to His Post</h3>
<p>Marshal Marshall, the special envoy to China of U.S. President Truman, returned to his country to report on his duties last month. On the 12th, he and his wife flew from the American capital to return to his post in China, arriving in Beiping the day before yesterday. This high-ranking five-star marshal, despite his advanced age, has tirelessly traveled between China and the United States, dedicating himself to strengthening Sino-American relations and maintaining world peace. The Chinese people have boundless respect and admiration for him. Since Marshall's arrival, in the short period of three months, he has made indelible contributions to China's unity and peace. Now, upon his return, the current situation is vastly different from when Marshall returned home last time. Although the Soviet troops in the Northeast have withdrawn from Shenyang and Changchun, the small number of National troops stationed in Changchun to take over the area have been fiercely attacked by the so-called Communist troops, and the fighting is intensifying. Some of the Communist troops have even invaded the urban area. In the domestic political atmosphere, the harmony since the Political Consultative Conference has been overshadowed by resentment and ambition. The Communist Party's newspaper has even publicly insulted the president and slandered the government, displaying an arrogant and overbearing attitude. All of this is enough to render Marshal Marshall's efforts futile. As Marshal Marshall returns to China, we would like to briefly discuss the current situation in China, to express our sincere welcome.</p>
<p>First of all, we must say that the interests of China and the United States are completely the same. Because the interests of the two countries are the same, Marshal Marshall's efforts are not only respected by the American people, but also by the Chinese people. China needs peace and unity, and the traditional American policy towards China also supports a China with complete territorial sovereignty. The United States' policy is in line with the demands of the Chinese people. Since the 1911 Revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, intended to follow the advanced democracies of Europe and the United States and implement democratic governance. However, Yuan Shikai usurped power, followed by the division of the country by warlords and local forces, which led to a setback in the great cause of democratic nation-building. In order to complete the national revolution and establish a unified and strong democratic China, the Chinese Kuomintang launched the Northern Expedition based on the Three Principles of the People, and the country was finally unified. Just as the National Government was devoting itself to nation-building, Japanese warlords intensified their aggression, eventually leading to the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan triggered by the Lugouqiao Incident. The Chinese Kuomintang is the party that created the Republic of China. China, under the rule of the Kuomintang and under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, completed the task of full-scale resistance against Japan and achieved victory. The Three Principles of the People advocated by the Chinese Kuomintang have been unanimously accepted by other political parties as the highest guiding principle for nation-building. The spirit of the Three Principles of the People is to adopt the essence of Western civilization and democratic politics and reconcile it with our country's inherent traditions. The new China of the Three Principles of the People will dedicate itself to world peace and create a splendid new culture for mankind. This represents the general intention of the Chinese people and will surely resonate with the American allies across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Kuomintang will undoubtedly do more for China's unity and peace and China's democratic politics, judging from past history and future trends. Although the Kuomintang's recent actions may not be satisfactory in every aspect, we cannot deny that the Kuomintang's rule is still a stabilizing force. In particular, we cannot deny that the Kuomintang's ideals are closest to the democratic politics of Western Europe, including the United States. Although not all Chinese people support the Kuomintang, they are convinced that only under the Kuomintang's rule can they enjoy some basic freedoms. Therefore, we generally have this understanding of the current situation in China: no matter how many political parties there are in the future, the Kuomintang must still bear the responsibility of leadership. Therefore, all efforts to seek peaceful reunification of China can only be achieved by strengthening the current National Government. The more one tries to elevate the position of other political parties and weaken the power of the National Government, the more one will run counter to the expectation of peaceful reunification. As a result, the strong, unified, and democratic China expected by President Truman will be delayed and unable to be realized due to the Communist Party's deliberate attempt to seize power and its arrogant and overbearing behavior.</p>
<p>We need not point out here the position and ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The Communist Party has consistent characteristics all over the world, and those who are aware of the situation will naturally know it. Their current arrogance in China is due to the Kuomintang's step-by-step concession and tolerance for the sake of the country, but most of it is due to the support of external forces. Today's situation in China seems serious again, but this situation is actually created by the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese people are very grateful for the efforts of the allies for the unity and peace of China, but we cannot but frankly point out that the support for the Communist Party's forces will inevitably cause regrettable consequences in the future and even at present. This is neither the general wish of the Chinese people, nor will it affect the national policy of the allies, and it will give the world's lasting peace future irremediable disasters. At this time, we have to sincerely say a few honest words.</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall's mission in China is difficult. This mission may be more difficult than the one he had during his tenure as Chief of Staff. This time he returns to his post, but the current situation has deteriorated so much that we feel a little embarrassed to see this elderly and respected five-star marshal again. However, with the marshal's talent and wisdom, we believe that there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. We remember that when Marshal Marshall came to China as the special envoy of the President of the United States last time, we hoped that his relationship with China would be like that of General Lafayette with the marshal's country back then. Undoubtedly, the current situation in China and even the international situation cannot be compared with the situation at that time, but Marshal Marshall is shouldering a more important mission, which is related to the future of all mankind and the entire world. We wish the marshal and his wife a safe journey and wish the marshal's mission a success.</p>
<h3>U.S. Technical Intelligence Office Discovers New Secret German Inventions; American Industry Will Adopt Them</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The "U.S. Frontline Technical Intelligence Office" is engaged in investigating secret scientific inventions in Germany, and its discoveries are of great value. For example: (1) Magnetic recorder, which uses gelatinous wire with special magnetic iron oxide. Its characteristics are that it is extremely light, and one mile of this special wire weighs only one pound, while steel wire weighs 55 pounds; (2) High-voltage power transmission method, which can transmit electricity to a place 600 miles away from the power source, which is twice as far as the ordinary method, and can be used for teleprinters and transmitters; (3) Wireless image transmission method, which uses underground wires for long-distance image transmission; (4) Automatically controlled storage battery; (5) Color film shooting method, which only uses one film instead of three films. Germans also have invented long-distance photography technology that can shoot the situation on the opposite shore across the English Channel, and the printed images are extremely clear; (6) Extracting Acetylene from gas, which is a secret manufacturing method of the Faben Chemical Factory. In addition, German inventions include artificial rubber that is similar to Nylon, new-type bakelite, artificial fuel and lubricating oil, and new-type alloys. In aviation, the German Party has been working hard to research aircraft engines with hard carbon power. During the test, an artificial wind chamber with a speed of more than 5,000 miles per hour was used. The Germans also invented a diesel engine that is extremely light, extremely fast, and uses air to reduce heat. The 6,000-horsepower diesel engine used by its navy is far more effective than that used by the United States. The U.S. Frontline Technical Intelligence Office has discovered many new scientific inventions, and American industry will soon adopt them one by one.</p>

He answered: After graduating from Lingnan University in Guangzhou, he went to various universities in Canada and the United States to study political economy. After returning to China in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he first served as an editor at Haitong News Agency, and later as a reporter for the English Great American Evening Post and a correspondent for a Canadian newspaper in Shanghai. At the end of the 29th year, due to his friendship with Chen Junhui, the secretary-general of the puppet National Economic Commission, he served as a member of the Economic Committee of the puppet Central Political Committee. Chen Junhui served as the director of the committee himself. However, the committee never held meetings or worked. He did not receive a salary, but only received a monthly vehicle allowance of 490 puppet currency. His job was only to verbally report Shanghai's economic trends when meeting with Chen. This continued until the end of June of the 32nd year, when he transferred to be the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the puppet regime, which was under the jurisdiction of the puppet Ministry of Construction. At that time, it was managed by the enemy's military, and Japanese personnel were retained. After the puppet government took over, the Japanese personnel left. After I took this position, most of the personnel were not changed, and old personnel were still used. Later, because Chen Junhui became the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry, he transferred to be the Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the puppet regime. The job of the bureau was originally to inspect exported raw silk and cotton. However, when he took office, the Pacific War had already begun, exports were suspended, and there was nothing to do, so the bureau only had more than ten employees. At that time, the director was on duty, and the monthly salary was 600 puppet currency. The expenses were drawn from the puppet Ministry of Industry. He served in this position for eight months. From June of the 33rd year, he was transferred to be the Director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the puppet regime, which was still under the jurisdiction of the puppet Ministry of Industry. The job of the bureau was to review insurance companies and restrict indiscriminate establishment. This is the general experience. However, it must be stated that during his tenure as the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the puppet regime, he resumed the exchange between the rear area and the occupied area, making it easier for merchants and civilians. After the victory, on September 30 last year, he surrendered to the Military Statistics Bureau. According to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, those who surrender can have their sentences reduced. The defendant did not hire a lawyer, and no family members were present in court to listen. The court ordered that the case be heard again another day, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Second Meeting of the Housing Allocation Committee; Unified Lease Subgroup; Implementation Details Determined</h3>
<p>The Housing Committee of the Executive Yuan for allocating houses to various agencies in Shanghai held its second meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Qian Dajun, Peng Xuepei, Pan Gongzhan, and others attended. The draft organizational regulations, including the China Trust Bureau's unified lease of houses approval items, the application for housing allocation by various agencies, and the handling of cases assigned by the Executive Yuan, were decided. There will be one secretary-general, and four groups will be set up: general affairs, allocation, investigation, and execution. It was also resolved to implement detailed rules for the unified lease and sublease of houses occupied by enemy aliens. The details are as follows: (1) The list of houses occupied by enemy aliens that are not owned by the enemy puppet regime shall be based on the list prepared by the former Japanese Affairs Management Office. (2) For houses where the property rights have been approved and returned by the Enemy Puppet Industry Processing Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District, the Central Trust Bureau shall first sign a lease agreement with the owner, and then sign a sublease agreement with various agencies. For those that have not yet been approved and returned, the Central Trust Bureau shall first sign a sublease agreement with various agencies, and then sign a lease agreement with the owner after the property rights are returned. (3) The owners of the aforementioned houses shall submit a list of the houses to the committee for review before April 30. (4) If the owners of the aforementioned houses actually need to live in the houses themselves, they shall be exempted from the unified lease upon approval by the committee. (5) If the owners of the aforementioned houses fail to submit the list before April 30, or fail to sign a lease agreement with the Central Trust Bureau within ten days after the committee approves the unified lease list, the committee may directly dispose of the houses and hand them over to the Central Trust Bureau to sign a sublease agreement with various agencies. (6) All houses that have been approved for lease shall be leased from May 1. The rent shall be calculated based on the rent in the 26th year of the Republic of China, multiplied by the multiple stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The rent shall be prepaid monthly by the Central Trust Bureau to the signed owner. For those who have not signed, the rent shall be temporarily kept by the Central Trust Bureau and delivered to the sub-leasing agency after the contract is signed. Regardless of the order in which they enter the house, the rent shall be calculated from May 1 and prepaid monthly, and the rent prepaid by the Central Trust Bureau shall be paid in advance when signing the sublease agreement. (7) The lease term for the former British houses shall be one year, and shall not be extended or transferred. (8) The terms of the lease agreement and the sub-lease agreement shall be approved by the committee. (9) The Central Trust Bureau shall deduct 4% of the rent payable to the owner as a handling fee when handling the sub-lease. Finally, the working procedures for the houses of various agencies in Shanghai were determined, and Tao Rui was appointed as the head of the General Affairs Group, Song Xunlun as the head of the Allocation Group, Bi Gaokui and Zhao Wenxi as the heads of the Investigation Group, and Wang Gongxia and Liao Gongzhu as the heads of the Executive Group.

<p>The Municipal Government, in view of Shanghai's status as an international city, has begun to implement a plan to build a great Shanghai. On the one hand, it is planning to build the Pudong Bridge to connect Pudong and Puxi culture. On the other hand, it plans to take back and take over the 13 districts of Yanghang, Dachang, Qibao, Xinzhuang, Caohang, Sanlin, Zhoupu, Chenhang, Tangwan, Minhang, Beiqiao, Duqiao, and Maqiao, according to the scope determined in the 16th year of the Republic of China, in order to meet development needs.

In addition, Shantou urgently needs grain. It is planned to purchase 2,000 dan of rice in Shanghai. It has now been decided that the Ministry of Food will allocate 2,000 dan and not purchase it in Shanghai, because Shanghai rice is not allowed to be exported freely.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Traffic Volume Sometimes Exceeds New York Records; Telephone Company Hosts Reporters to Report on Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The General Manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company, Mr. Fortune, hosted reporters from the city at the company's headquarters on Fujian Road yesterday at 2:30 PM to observe various operations. The company manages the "Nine" line, and also has an information desk and time announcement service, which are very well-equipped. The work of announcing the time is mechanical and arduous. The announcers do not have listening devices and simply announce the time in Chinese and English. They are rotated by the information desk staff every five minutes. The company also has a technician training class, which is equipped with complete wiring and mechanical diagrams and practice equipment. A battery room is attached to the power generation room. In the event of a power outage by the power company, the batteries can provide power. However, the batteries are old and their effectiveness is reduced. Previously, they could last for up to two days, but now, in the event of a power outage, they can only last for two hours. In such cases, all telephones will be shut down, with service reserved for military and police agencies. The telephone company currently has over 1,000 employees, including approximately 450 operators, half of whom are female employees.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Fortune, in 1946, the "Nine" line was the busiest, with each line reaching 3.5 calls per hour, and the "One" line reaching 6 calls per hour, even exceeding New York records. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that citizens of the city will cooperate and conserve unnecessary telephone calls. The company is currently losing 30 million yuan per month. All the city's telephones are supplied from abroad, and the United States itself is currently short of 2 million telephones. Therefore, it seems impossible to increase the number of telephones in Shanghai within one year. The company has now decided to appropriately increase telephone charges, partly to make up for losses and partly to limit the number of calls. The price increase standard has not yet been decided and has been submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for review and handling.</p>

<h3>A Good Opportunity to Solve the Urban Housing Problem: Talk by Xiao Zheng, Chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Amid the city's housing shortage, Mr. Xiao Zheng, a leader in the Chinese land reform movement, member of the Central Standing Committee, and Chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society, came to Shanghai for medical treatment for a stomach ailment. Our reporter made a special visit to him at the hospital to inquire about his opinions on the urban housing problem. He kindly gave the following speech:</p>
<p>1.  The major cities are now experiencing a widespread housing shortage. At the same time, due to various reasons, genuine real estate operators are generally suffering from the frustration of not receiving legitimate profits and the pain of not being able to manage and recover their properties. Under this contradictory phenomenon, it is a good opportunity to solve the urban housing problem!</p>
<p>2.  According to our land reform perspective, the first step to solve the problem should be to adjust the existing land and housing relationships. Tenants or owners of entire rental properties can request the government to purchase the property and land at an assessed value (if the currency value changes significantly in the future, the assessed value should be re-evaluated). 2. The government issues bonds through the Land Bank to purchase the property and land, and repays the principal and interest in installments over five to twenty years. The landlord can use these bonds to exchange for shares of state-owned enterprises such as railways, shipping, and industrial and mining enterprises. 3. The houses purchased by the government are then resold to the current tenants at the purchase price (only if the current tenants declare that they relinquish the right can they be sold by other methods), and they are required to pay the principal and interest to the Land Bank on a monthly basis. The term should not be longer than the payment period for the government's purchase.</p>
<p>3.  The results obtained by following the aforementioned methods are as follows: 1. Tenants no longer pay unreasonable rents, but instead purchase houses and land in installments over several years according to the actual price. They will inevitably cherish the houses and implement various improvements. 2. Landlords no longer suffer from collecting unreasonable rents and the inability to recover capital, but also have to pay house taxes and other taxes. Their original investment capital is recovered in one lump sum with bonds guaranteed by the national bank. As a result, they can recover the principal and interest from the Land Bank in installments. If they wish to exchange for shares of state-owned enterprises, their profits will be even greater. 3. The government does not need to increase the issuance of currency to purchase many unmanageable houses. It simply acts as an "intermediary," issuing a bond to guarantee to the landlords that they can recover the principal and interest from the national bank on an annual basis, and at the same time guaranteeing to the tenants that they only need to pay the purchase price according to this term, without any further trouble, and they will have complete ownership of the property upon expiration. This measure by the government adjusts the current social chaos. At the same time, house taxes and land taxes will have accurate basis and responsible payers. In our theory, we do not approve of collecting house taxes. 4. This three-way beneficial measure only harms the sub-landlords, who can no longer exchange illegitimate rights for gold bars. At the same time, it harms those who illegally occupy houses. They also have no right to live in houses without paying money.</p>
<p>4.  Can this method of adjusting the existing land and housing relationship solve the housing shortage problem? This depends on the following points:</p>
<p>5.  The current housing shortage is not entirely due to a lack of housing, but rather to an unreasonable and chaotic phenomenon that makes it difficult for most people to find a way to solve the housing problem. Now the government is opening up a broad avenue, taking out the large houses that are currently occupied by people or are only paying the minimum rent and formally distributing them, so that whoever can pay the normal price can live in a reasonable house. 2. As a result of this adjustment, tenants who cannot afford the price of the house will have to give up the house or a part of it, recruit people to buy the house with him, or sublet some of the houses to pay the price of the house, so that people who have no house to live in can get a house. But he does not need to pay a top fee with gold bars, and most of the housing shortage problem can be solved in this way. 3. The landlord's real estate was originally stagnant and had no market. After this method, it can be revitalized. Real estate owners, on the surface, do not receive the real estate price in cash in one lump sum, but according to the current value, it is averaged and recovered in fifteen years, and the annual income is not a small amount. (Currently, an average small house is valued at 15 million yuan, and it is averaged over 15 years, with an annual recovery of 1 million yuan, with legal interest attached. The tenant pays about 89,000 yuan per month.) Fifteen percent "purchase years," according to the usual interest rate, is also not low. The housing price recovered by the landlord can indeed be invested in new houses. If the landlord no longer invests in real estate due to the current high interest rates, real estate can fall in price due to this method. It is easier for capable people to build houses for their own use, which indirectly helps solve the housing shortage. 4. Perhaps some people doubt that no one will do the real estate business according to this method, and the housing shortage will become more serious. From the perspective of our land reform, we believe that the real estate business is not an example of encouragement at all. We want to encourage "home ownership." Therefore, we are willing to have the government run the Land Bank to lend money to people who build their own houses. We also hope that there will be "homeowner cooperatives" in the cities in the future to jointly build houses and solve common problems. We do not want a few large real estate owners to come out to build large houses to rent to the general public.</p>
<p>5.  What we land reformers hope for in the urban area is: "Municipal land ownership" and "home ownership." The current housing problem is the result of the irrational use of municipal land. We believe that this urban housing problem is not an accidental phenomenon, but has always existed, but it has become particularly obvious after the war. We solve the problem, do not only care about the present, only seek to make up for it, we must adhere to the basic principles and solve social problems in a practical way. Therefore, we believe that the land administration agencies in large cities should have full power to solve the housing problem and the rationalization of related taxes. At the same time, the lack of a Land Bank is indeed a major regret. If the government really wants to solve this major social problem—the land problem—the Land Bank must be established as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Police Station Repeatedly Warns, Bond Market Still Active, Search Carried Out Yesterday Afternoon, More Than Seventy People Arrested</h3>
<p>The opening price of the national bonds yesterday was around 5,250 yuan. Retail investors were active and assisted by northern speculators, which caused the price to reach a high of 5,600 yuan again. Relevant departments repeatedly notified that gatherings were not allowed. There was some profit-taking at the high, and the price struggled around 5,350 yuan at noon. Midway through the day, there were rumors of trouble, but driven by greed, operators disregarded everything. After 11:00 AM, the police station carried out a search and arrested a large number of bond market speculators by truck (70 men and 2 women). The market price then came to a halt. Based on the final price, all bonds had risen slightly compared to the previous closing price. Trading in Chinese stocks also stopped several times. Initially, the highest prices were Yong Sha at 5,180 yuan, Meiya at 4,350 yuan, and Jingfu at 435 yuan. The prices then declined. Before noon, Yong Sha retreated to 4,930 yuan, Meiya to 4,130 yuan, and Jingfu to 415 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. The noon closing prices for popular stocks such as Yong Sha showed slight declines compared to the previous closing prices. The situation for less popular stocks was stable. There were still many sellers of old stocks. The asking prices were slightly higher in the afternoon. The supply and demand for foreign stocks were balanced yesterday. There was continued profit-taking in floating stocks. The market was not doing well. Jardine Matheson traded at 22,000 yuan. People were uneasy. Ewo and British-American Tobacco struggled at the previous closing price. There was an abundance of speculative funds. When the market price stabilized, there were more buyers for popular stocks such as Ewo and British-American Tobacco. Yegong was still being absorbed by Yezhong Dayou. Asian stocks were supported by retail investors from securities firms. Therefore, the aforementioned stocks were stable near noon. The rest were just so-so. The result of the noon closing was that Ewo, British-American Tobacco, Asian stocks, and Yegong rose slightly, while the rest were flat.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>The gold market was stable yesterday, with a mostly sideways trend. Credit was tight. There was some slight improvement midway through the day. The U.S. dollar boosted buying interest, but the general sentiment did not have high expectations for the future of the gold market. After rising, many sold off. The opening price in the morning was around 1.51 million yuan. After opening, it broke the 1.5 million yuan mark. Guang Bang absorbed a small amount. Soon after, it gradually recovered. The Central Bank's allocation was still at the original price, and there was no demand. The scope for speculation was becoming narrower. It was not easy for those with capital to lend it out. There were more buyers at lower prices. U.S. dollars were extremely tight. Before noon, it had risen back to 1.55 million yuan before leveling off. At noon, it was around 1.53 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was more profit-taking, and it declined slightly. Jewelry sales were slightly brisk. The final price was stable, rising by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Ornamental gold was 168,000 yuan. Silver was 1,500 yuan. Silver dollars were still mediocre. The secret rate for overnight lending was even more rampant, with interest rates of only 1.2 to 1.5 cents. Those with capital still felt it difficult to find counterparties.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Sales Plentiful</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Large Denomination Transactions</p>
<p>Foreign exchange, U.S. dollars, with substandard incoming goods, were still in great demand. Demand exceeded supply. The general sentiment was that there was hope for U.S. dollars. Foreign firms were also selling gold to exchange for U.S. dollars. In addition, large denomination 100-yuan notes were not commonly used for settlement. Money changers were willing to offer a discount of 70 yuan, but there were no takers. As a result, the amount of money in circulation was extremely scarce. From an initial price of 2,000 yuan at the beginning of the morning, it gradually rose. Before noon, it reached a high price of 2,065 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 2,050 yuan. It softened slightly in the afternoon. The result was that it rose by 20 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars were flat. There was no surge of buyers. Although old goods were flat, new goods fell back by 5 yuan. Rupees were 500 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars were 400 yuan. Supply exceeded demand for both.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market soared due to sharp increases in prices in the interior and higher costs. Sellers were even more determined to sell. Sales became smoother. Indica and japonica rice prices rose uniformly by a strong 3,000 yuan. Flour also rose by 200 to 300 yuan following rice prices. Soybeans also increased by 300 to 500 yuan. Raw peanuts were secretly tight. Soybean cake rose again by 400 to 500 yuan. However, the market gradually softened at the close. Wheat bran was still stable. There was some inventory of edible oil. Attempts to raise prices were weak, with a slight increase of 1,000 yuan. All grains rose following rice prices.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Transactions Lackluster</h3>
<p>The yarn market declined slightly yesterday. Northern merchants showed some interest in medium-count yarns. There was very little activity from other customers. People were not as excited as the day before. There were more sellers among the peers. Prices did not plunge due to the insufficient supply of spot goods from small factories. The average price of combed yarn was approximately 20,000 yuan. Money prices were flat. Only 32-count doubled yarn closed at 1.12 million yuan, falling by as much as 60,000 yuan. Yesterday was also the regular period for the Textile Construction Corporation to open for yarn sales. There were 28 varieties of yarn and money offered for auction. Opening prices were generally similar to the previous period. Only 42-count doubled thread was slightly lower by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The 20-count and 16-count yarns urgently needed in the market were both absent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton was reported at 0.35 pounds per pound, equivalent to USD 27.60 for the near term and USD 27.62 for the far term. Middling spot was USD 28.11. The spot cotton market in this city was still stable, but there was not much progress in transactions. Only Shenxin No. 6 Factory imported over 200 bales of Taicang cotton. Most of the transactions were conducted among the peers. The Textile Construction Corporation has not yet purchased.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Work Loans Reach 560 Million</h3>
<p>As of April 10, the total amount of loans reviewed and approved by the Shanghai Branch of the Joint Office of the China, Communications, Farmers, and Central Banks Resumption of Work Loan Committee totaled 558.5 million yuan, involving 89 businesses. The majority of them were in textiles and chemicals. The following is a record of the statistics:</p>
<p>Industry Number of Businesses Amount (Ten Thousand Yuan)</p>
<p>Textile 35 33,000</p>
<p>Chemical 45 3,970</p>
<p>Machinery 4 358</p>
<p>Tobacco 3 430</p>
<p>Oil and Grain 1 300</p>
<p>Mining 1 800</p>
<p>Total 89 55,850</p>
<h3>Summary of Commercial Information</h3>
<p>Timber: The market is still weak and prices are difficult to recover. It is heard that foreign pine has arrived in Shanghai. Due to tariff reasons, it has not yet been put on the market.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Medium-grain white sugar prices are low, sales are active, and it is gradually improving. The association's planned prices have risen by 1,000 yuan. The prices quoted for boxed white crystal sugar range from 92,000 yuan for higher quality to 88,000 yuan for lower quality. Coarse-bag crystal sugar is 85,000 yuan. It is reported that Chaoqing sugar has been cleared, and those with complete tax documents are priced at 44,000 to 45,000 yuan, with little change.</p>
<p>Turmeric: Recently, due to successive arrivals from Taiwan, supply exceeds demand. Previous prices were close to 70,000 yuan, but now there are few buyers even at 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk: Factory silk prices are stable, with medium-grade small lots rising slightly by 20,000 yuan. Artificial silk prices have fallen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan across the board. Actual sales in the silk market have weakened, with peers selling more than buying, and prices have fallen across the board.</p>
<p>Chemical Raw Materials: Caustic soda and soda ash continue to be high. White petroleum jelly has arrived, and prices have fallen slightly, almost matching yellow petroleum jelly.</p>
<p>Tea: The quality of the new tea recently shipped to Shanghai is inferior to before. The bottom prices may be difficult to stabilize. Trade in old tea has become increasingly sluggish in recent days. It is said that British merchants intend to collect it, and the market has been slightly stimulated and shows some improvement.</p>
<p>Paper: Foreign paper prices have risen slightly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Domestic rough-edged paper prices have fallen due to sales by the Minbang.</p>
<p>Leather: American tree-grain leather has fallen slightly. Raw sheepskin prices have fallen again and again because manufacturers' purchasing power is sluggish, resulting in oversupply. The rest are still stable. Dextel Dyestuff Company's pigment clearing office has begun to allocate pigments, and notices have been issued for shipments. The goods from the Ciba factory have also been put on the market, and transactions have been strong recently.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Transshipment Certificate Goods Subject to Import Regulations</h3>

(For example: Except for the following goods, all goods shipped from foreign countries such as the United States to Hong Kong, transshipped to various places in China such as Guangzhou or other places, whether or not they are British territories, do not need to obtain a transshipment license). The following goods still need to apply for a transshipment license.

<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: Since the news of the discovery of a huge gold mine in South Africa was published in the newspapers, the price of gold in the London free market has fallen by 25 percent, which is the worst in six weeks. The reason is that the general public has lost confidence in storing gold and has increased the purchasing power of gold pounds and paper money.</p>
<p>The French Minister of Agriculture believes that it is difficult for the United States to meet the needs of European countries in the current world food shortage. Therefore, France has to change its original export plan to reduce food exports. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce will be inaugurated in Nanjing on the 26th of this month. The Ministry of Social Affairs has ordered the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce to set up a reception office. There are a total of more than 100 representatives from the Chambers of Commerce of various cities across the country who will register starting from the 20th. The conference period is scheduled for three days.</p>

<h3>Chengdu Lida Middle School Tragedy: Teacher Killed in Cold Blood</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Correspondent] Amidst Director Liu's advocacy of a new academic atmosphere, a shocking incident occurred at Chengdu's private Lida Middle School at 1:00 PM on the 10th of this month. Student Zhang Guogong, having been expelled for excessive absenteeism (the school had been in session for two months, and the student had only attended three or four days), stabbed Director of Student Affairs Zhu Peisheng with a knife. The entire city was in an uproar, all fearing for the future of education. The school's faculty and students petitioned the court and provincial government, demanding strict punishment. Zhu, a native of Hebei, was diligent, conscientious, and just, and of excellent character and scholarship. He had served as Director of Student Affairs at Cheng County Middle School for four and a half years. He is currently at West China Union Hospital, with severe stab wounds to his right forearm, lower jaw, and right shoulder and neck. The wound below his right ear is especially serious, approximately four and a half inches long and deep. He is not yet out of danger. Director Liu Ying was extremely angered after the incident. The school's faculty has already gone on strike and issued a telegram, requesting sympathy and assistance from all parties to maintain a positive academic environment. (Quan)</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Expert to Leave US for China Next Month; Dr. Lyon Releases Report on Inspection Trip to China</h3>

One hundred and thirty experts attended the welcoming meeting, including Miss Heth. Before reporting on the results of her inspection trip, Dr. Lyon solemnly stated that there were no rigid educational rules in China, and that children attending school accounted for less than 25% of the total. Dr. Lyon believes that China already has a good organization for implementing health programs, but noted that out of a population of 400 to 600 million, China has only 10,000 to 12,000 doctors.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Security Council: China Upholds the Common Interests of the United Nations and Will Never Trail Behind the United Kingdom and the United States</h3>
<p>— Aircrash on April 1st - Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing Reporting from the United States</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the United Nations Security Council meeting, the battleship "William Mary" I was on was just sailing from the French coast into New York. Everything in the New World was "new" to me, just like the new international temple of peace, unable to grasp the location of the new venue.</p>
<p>The Council meets at Hunter College on the outskirts of New York City. It takes more than half an hour to take the subway from 42nd Street in the city center to participate, and you have to change trains at 149th Street. Several neat buildings of Tingte College stand alone in the suburbs, and the national flags of the 51 United Nations have been moved from the roof of the London Central Building to the central lawn of Hunter College.</p>
<p>Security at the venue is even stricter than in London. Entry and exit require four checks. Plainclothes inspectors stand with military police, like secret police from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Miss Aggers is still the director of the conference's press department. She is one of the international press officers "transferred" from London.</p>
<p>Gromyko Exits the Venue</p>
<p>Published Large Photos</p>
<p>The news kingdom can be said to have issued a 100% mobilization order for this important international gathering. When the United Nations General Assembly was held in London in January, London newspapers were still only one large sheet per day, so many detailed records and wonderful descriptions were inevitably incomplete. Readers could not fully enjoy themselves either. At that time, a batch of New York newspapers were shipped from the United States to London by special plane. Although they were a bit late, everyone still scrambled to read them. This time, the meeting in New York, the American news media believed it was the best opportunity to show off photos, pictures, descriptions, and comments. Even if a needle fell on the ground at the venue, the newspapers considered it good material to record. On the day Gromyko exited the venue on Wednesday, the New York Daily News published dozens of pages of large photos, from Gromyko failing in the debate, standing up with his chest out, turning his body, taking a step, Bay纳斯 looking at him, to walking out the door, getting in the car, and the national consulate. Every movement had photos published. A large group of reporters followed Gromyko all day long, entangled until 2:00 AM. Gromyko became extremely impatient and repeatedly replied to them: "There is nothing to say, you should go back. If Moscow has telegram instructions, I will call you. Okay, please go back!" The reporters still followed him. At 2:00 AM, Gromyko could no longer bear it and said with all his might: "Why are you so stupid? I am going to sleep now." The reporters slowly dispersed. Mr. Irving Liberman, a famous foreign reporter from the New York Post, did not return home until dawn that day. The next morning, this reporter appeared at the Soviet consulate again. He wanted Gromyko to answer his questions, even if he only said one word.</p>
<p>Headlining the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Published in Large Red Letters</p>
<p>It has been four days since the Soviet Union stopped attending the meeting, and many reporters are still tracking Gromyko. Many newspapers still use the Soviet Union's movements as headline news. The "American News" evening paper publishes the Soviet Union's movements in large red headlines every day. The New York Afternoon Post, which has a slightly left-leaning opinion, especially uses the most systematic text to explain the ins and outs of many issues. The United States is a country where freedom of speech has reached its peak. Their opinions and current affairs commentaries are extremely objective and reasonable analyses. Village women scolding in the streets or cold sarcasm are very rare.</p>
<p>In rare cases, you can see a slight glimpse, for example, several publications said that the Iranian issue was "a conspiracy of a few British and American oil mine capitalists," saying that "贝纳斯's background is the investors of Iranian oil fields," and also said that "阿拉 (Iran's petition representative) himself is an Iranian oil field comprador," but such unfounded slanders are, after all, rare.</p>
<p>According to a staff member of the conference's press department, there are a total of more than 800 reporters from New York City and other ports and countries stationed in New York who have requested to attend the meeting. However, there are only 300 seats for reporters to listen in, so many were directly turned away, and many were only issued admission tickets without seats in the venue. The day Miss Aggers took me into the venue, I saw many American colleagues standing outside the door craning their necks, and these people belonged to the latter category.</p>
<p>Reporters Sit on Spring Seats</p>
<p>Like in a Theater</p>
<p>The venue itself is indeed much smaller than London's Central Building, but the actual press seats are not inferior to London. The London conference was attended by fifty-one countries, with many seats for representatives, consultants, secretaries, and attendants. This time, the Council is only attended by eleven countries, there are fewer people singing the play, and more people watching the play. I said they were "singing a play," and in fact, it was indeed like singing a play. Isn't it? The pink walls, the lights that are controlled and adjusted at any time, the suitably adjusted sound system, and even the spring seats that the reporters sit on are like in a theater. The atmosphere of the venue is sometimes serious, sometimes playful, sometimes silent, and sometimes everyone laughs together. Shakespeare said: The world is a stage, and diplomats are the main characters who directly come on stage.</p>
<p>For example, once they discussed requesting reports on the entire incident from the Soviet Union and Iran. 贝纳斯's original proposal was limited to 11:00 AM on April 2nd, and the Australian and Polish representatives proposed to change it to 11:00 AM on April 3rd. The French representative echoed Australia and Poland's opinion, and his supplementary reason was: Today we are discussing this issue, in New York it is March 29th, and in Moscow Eastern European time, it is already March 30th. In order to take into account the factual needs, it should be extended by one day to April 3rd. 贝纳斯 then said: The April 2nd I said is already April 3rd in Moscow Eastern European time, so it is better not to change it. The whole place burst into laughter. The bald-headed Mexican representative was very realistic and said: Even if it is April 3rd, looking at the Soviet Union's appearance, it would be good if they could send it by April 4th. The Egyptian representative also had this intention. Finally, Chairman Guo Fuchu said very solemnly: Even if it is April 3rd, the conference has decided to limit the deadline to before 11:00 AM on April 3rd. Please send the reports from both countries. Without raising hands to vote, it was formally passed.</p>
<p>Fighting Alone</p>
<p>Never Attack Head-on</p>
<p>After the Iranian issue arose, the only one who voted in favor of the Soviet Union was the Polish representative, Lanz. After Soviet Gromyko did not attend the Iranian issue discussion, Lanz became the situation of fighting alone. This diplomat, with a dashing appearance, natural demeanor, and often wearing a purple-black suit, is much stronger than the Polish Foreign Minister at the last London conference. He speaks very clearly and also very tactfully. He never attacks people head-on. When he disagrees with 贝尔纳斯, he always has to go around in a circle, first saying that he agrees in principle, and then saying where to amend, even amending to be completely opposite. He often looks around with a smile, and except for the Australian representative sitting next to him, very few people give him any "smile." Poland's situation is pitiful enough, so pitiful that he himself understands.</p>
<p>Like at the London United Nations General Assembly, the venue uses both English and French. When the meeting was held in London, the representatives of France, Belgium, Egypt, and Ukraine all spoke French. This time, except for the French representative, almost all used English. However, Chairman Guo Fuchu always very orderly ordered "translation." The Soviet and Egyptian representatives both spoke English this time, both very fluently and sonorously. Each time a representative speaks, the lights are specially "illuminated." During the translation, the lights are shone on the translation seats in the middle of the horseshoe shape.</p>
<p>Two New and Old US Secretaries of State</p>
<p>Walking in Perfect Alignment</p>
<p>Because of the Iranian issue, 贝纳斯's attitude was very firm this time, and he specially rushed from Washington to participate in person. He spoke clearly and calmly, unlike when he had a "sandy voice" or trembling in London. Stettinius sat next to him without saying a word. These two new and old American Secretaries of State are both masters of diplomacy. Although their styles are different, their steps and opinions are always consistent. Once, 贝纳斯 was speaking and forgot to turn on the microphone, and Stettinius quickly brought it to him. They often entered and exited the venue together, and American reporters took many "following closely" shots of the two of them.</p>
<p>Two Major International Events in New York</p>
<p>China's Honorary Chairman</p>
<p>At the two major international events in New York, China was honored as chairman (Security Council and International Military Staff Committee). General Shang Qiyu's principles for the meeting are the same as Mr. Guo Fuchu's. We aim to uphold the common interests of the United Nations. Therefore, no matter from which angle you look at it, China is quite respected internationally. At least, we have no special mortal enemies in today's international community. The Chinese delegation to the Security Council once hosted Chinese journalists in New York. A reporter from the Chinese Overseas Daily asked Representative Guo: Is China following behind the United Kingdom and the United States? Mr. Guo Fuchu solemnly replied to him: China upholds the common interests of the United Nations and abides by the United Nations Charter, and will never follow behind anyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps that reporter had prejudices on certain issues, and a good press conference ended up with everyone blushing. The next day, another New York overseas Chinese newspaper, the American Daily News, published news of the reception saying: "...A certain Xu, a reporter from the Chinese Overseas Daily, publicly slandered the National Government at the reception, causing dissatisfaction among all the reporters."</p>
<p>Many people are afraid to meet news reporters, and news reporters themselves should also reflect on their own conduct. Representative Guo Taiqi said with great emotion that day: "We Chinese are still like this ourselves, what else can I say?" (April 1st)</p>
<p>Welcoming Hall Under Construction</p>
<p>American soldiers are supervising German war criminals in Bremerhaven to build a welcoming hall in preparation for accommodating the families of the American occupying forces. In all US-occupied areas, women and children whose husbands or fathers are stationed there can follow them.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>Daughterly Demeanor</h3>
<p>— Congjun</p>
<p>In feudal society, being born a woman seemed to require a specific kind of demeanor. Because of the emphasis on men over women, a great disparity was created between the sexes. It was as if women were always just women, and women and men had to have differences in language, behavior, attitude, and preferences. As a result, the woman in the minds of the general public was always gentle, tender, weak, shy, silent, joyless, dignified, melancholy, and prone to illness. Originally, women in feudal society were in a subordinate position to men, lacking independent personalities. All evaluations were limited to the subjective needs of the male side, and women also had to cultivate considerate, obedient, long-suffering, and gentle personalities in this environment.</p>
<p>The cultivation of this unique female personality can be said to be entirely due to the social environment. Because men were in a dominant position, the women they desired would certainly possess these personalities. These personalities then manifested in demeanor, naturally leaning towards gentleness and dignity. Women in the writings of ancient scholars were all depicted as frail and melancholy, silent and taciturn. If a woman spoke freely in a large gathering, expressing her emotions to the fullest, she would surely be seen as 'brazen.' But for men, it was different. They had the right to say what they wanted and thought, and they had the right to express their feelings. The "daughterly demeanor" shaped by the traditional social environment invisibly restricted the expression of women's emotions and the articulation of their thoughts.</p>
<p>The forms of "daughterly demeanor" handed down from the old society were passive, morbid, decadent, and declining. What "daughterly demeanor" manifested was an artificial, unnatural attitude and manner, with voices deliberately lowered and actions made especially refined. Normal emotions could not be properly expressed, resulting in psychological abnormalities. Sometimes one had to feign illness even when healthy, and add a few coughs even without needing to cough. Lin Daiyu in Dream of the Red Chamber can be taken as a typical representative of this kind of "daughterly demeanor."</p>
<p>According to modern progressive thought, this kind of "daughterly demeanor" from the old society should no longer exist among new women. Our standards for judging female beauty are different from before in various ways. In the past, people thought that melancholic and sentimental women were beautiful, but modern people's views are completely different. Melancholic and sentimental women are morbid and do not meet the conditions of beauty. The most important thing for modern women is to have a healthy body and mind, be strong and robust, express emotions appropriately, adapt to life properly, have a generous attitude, natural manners, and be neither self-deprecating nor arrogant. Say what you want to say, do what you want to do. When among men, do not think of yourself as "I am a woman," and do not have the concept of "he is a man and I am a woman." Respect your independent personality, and deal with people and things with a pure heart and noble behavior.</p>
<p>As for the general tenderness, composure, and dignity of women, we naturally cannot completely deny them. We do not object to women loving their husbands with considerate feelings, and we do not object to women loving their children with a gentle and kind attitude. We should preserve the special and beautiful aspects of women's personalities, but we disagree with letting women suppress their emotions, unconditionally endure humiliation without resistance, and blindly obey in any situation, becoming like sheep. We oppose pretentious "womanly demeanor." We hope that the demeanor women express outwardly (of course, inner thoughts determine outer demeanor) is natural and appropriate, generous and moderate, lively and happy.</p>
<p>Contemporary historian Chen Hengzhe said: "Women of the new era should maintain their sexual personality on the one hand, and express their individuality on the other." Oppressed women under the grip of feudal forces lacked precisely the "individuality" that Mr. Chen mentioned. The "individuality" of women differs just as the "individuality" of men differs. The women shaped by the environment of the old society, from that kind of "daughterly demeanor," were made from a single mold, and of course, there was no "individuality" to speak of.</p>
<p>Society has changed, and the times have turned to a new page. We hope that the "daughterly demeanor" expressed by new women is full of a spirit of active progress and noble and beautiful individuality. It is better not to be a woman at all, otherwise, one must be able to speak and dare to speak, be able to do and dare to do, be able to laugh and dare to laugh, be able to scold and dare to scold! Women raised in glass greenhouses as playthings for men, that kind of frail "daughterly demeanor," that kind of suppressed, dare-not-speak, dare-not-do "daughterly demeanor," that kind of unreservedly accommodating men, obeying men, forgetting their own status, and only knowing how to please men all day long "daughterly demeanor," we are willing to be eliminated by the raging waves of the new era from now on!</p>
<h3>Sister-in-Law Song</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>"Long pipe, short pouch,</p>
<p>I am my mother's spoiled darling,</p>
<p>I am my father's precious treasure,</p>
<p>I am my brother's dear sister.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law says I don't go to the fields,</p>
<p>How many more years can I spend at home?</p>
<p>My sister-in-law says I don't plant scallions,</p>
<p>How many more winters can I spend at home?</p>
<p>Take the abacus and calculate,</p>
<p>I have been at home for two whole years;</p>
<p>Take the abacus and calculate,</p>
<p>I have been at home for two and a half years."</p>
<p>This is a folk song between sisters-in-law in a large family. In this song, we can see the lack of cooperation and mutual hostility between sisters-in-law in Chinese families. Therefore, how to improve the Chinese family system? And how to reconcile the disharmonious atmosphere between sisters-in-law in large families? This is also a question worth studying and discussing.</p>
<p>Local Customs</p>
<h3>The Production Area of Hairy Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>— Duyun</p>
<p>These days, the cheapest vegetables on the market are hairy bamboo shoots, only costing two or three hundred yuan per catty, because there are many sources. The red-husked hairy bamboo shoots eaten in Shanghai come from Hangzhou, but not many. The yellow-husked ones come from Ningbo, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of the market.</p>
<p>The place in Ningbo that produces the most bamboo shoots is called "Wuyan," located sixty li west of Yin County. That place is located in the Chongshan mountains, part of the Siming Mountain range, more than a thousand feet above sea level. There are more than a thousand households, with a street to sell daily necessities, catering to local needs. There is a large rock on the mountain, which can be dozens of zhang in size. Because all the crows in Yongxi go out to forage for food during the day and return to rest around this rock at night, it is called "Crow Rock." The village is mostly inhabited by people with the surnames Weng and Mao, so it is also called "Weng Rock." Within a radius of dozens of li around Wuyan, all that is planted is hairy bamboo, which can be described as "no other trees in between." Therefore, the local people use hairy bamboo to build houses, and bamboo leaves and branches for firewood. Most utensils are made of bamboo. All year round, they rely on the production of bamboo: hairy bamboo shoots in spring, whip shoots in summer and autumn, and winter bamboo shoots in winter. They also cut down hairy bamboo and carry it to Fengyu Market or Lujiapu, twenty li away, to sell, exchanging it for everything to solve their needs for clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>The hairy bamboo shoots produced there are fresher and more delicious than those from other places, originally because thousands of crows roost in the bamboo forests of Crow Rock at night, leaving droppings in the bamboo forests, increasing the fertilizer. Therefore, the local residents treat the crows very well, prohibiting shooting and capturing, treating them as their food and clothing parents!</p>
<p>Those who do bamboo shoot business have a station in the village, specializing in collecting hairy bamboo shoots. After collecting the bamboo shoots, they hire people to carry them to the bamboo shoot boats at Fengyu Market. The boats leave that night and arrive at Jiangxia in Ningbo the next day, then they are transported to steamships, arriving in Shanghai on the third day. Therefore, the freshest hairy bamboo shoots eaten by Shanghai people take at least three days. If the steamship is delayed, it may take five to seven days or more. The bamboo shoot vendors soak the bamboo shoots in water to prevent them from aging easily. Therefore, no matter what, Shanghai people cannot eat fresh hairy bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>There are good and bad years for bamboo shoots, usually every other year is a good year, but there are also intervals of two or three years.</p>
<p>Hairy bamboo shoots have a season. After the season, they become hairy bamboo. During the peak production period, the bamboo shoot factories buy them in large quantities to make canned bamboo shoots. Ningbo's Shengsun Factory was the first to do so.</p>

<h3>Cape Bag</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shufang</p>
<p>This is a cape bag suitable for babies around half a year old. Infants often like to kick off the blanket covering them with their small feet, catching a cold. This cape bag is very suitable for carrying outdoors for naps or outings. It is very simple to make.</p>
<p>Materials: Thick white flannel or thin cotton is fine. Pink or sky-blue satin trim, about a chi of elastic band, buttons, etc.</p>
<p>Making: Cut according to the dimensions in the diagram (if it is wide flannel, you can cut it in one piece without dividing it into three pieces), sew by hand or machine. An elastic band can be sewn into the hat brim (adjust the length according to the size of the baby's face). It is made in the same way as a small cape, but the bottom is sewn shut and does not open. The edges of the small hat and the openings for the hands, as well as the main opening, are trimmed with satin (pink or sky blue), and the buttons should also match. After completion, it is simple, elegant, beautiful, and practical.</p>
