<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕政治協商會議分組委員會第一組政府組，今日下午三時舉行行第一次會議，研討各會員所提意見，定明日繼續舉行第二次會議。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕政治協商會議，十六日第六次會議，議程爲討論軍事類問題，並請由軍政部林次長報告整軍情形。提案有：曾會員琦等五人提「停止軍事衝突實行軍隊國家化案」，及張會員　等九人提「實行軍隊國家化並大量裁兵案」。</p>
<p>（合衆社重慶十五日電）政治協商會議，今日已接受政府之改組計劃草案，該草案將仍以領袖地位賦諸國民黨，並奉蔣主席爲主席，其職權在約束及權衡制度下，介乎美總統與英王兩者之間。此項計劃，僅於原則上被接受，技術上細則，來予議定。國民黨仍保有委任過渡政府之權，惟各黨各派在改組之國民政府委員會中，有其決定政策之權。國府委會將代替最高國防會議，成爲國家之最高立法機關，並於其預算支配上，監察政府內各部長。各該部長除因該預算上之約束外，並不向國府委會負責。政治協商會議今晨就擴大政府容納各黨派，及國府委會席數分配二事，重加辯論。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十五日廣播稱：重慶政治協商會議，本日下午舉行第五次會議，共黨代表提出保障人民自由之提案十一件，逐一加以詳細之解釋，歷時頗久。</p>
<h3>施政綱領無提案　各會員僅作廣泛意見交換　歸綱研商後再提大會討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕政治協商會議，於今（十五日）上午九時，舉行第五次會議，研討施政綱領問題。各黨派及無黨派代表，均未提出正式提案，僅作廣泛之交換意見。今日發言者，計有梁漱溟·黃炎培·張申府·吳鐵城·董必武·章伯鈞·常乃德·羅隆基·陳布雷·李燭塵·邵從恩諸氏·當決定由分組委員會歸納各方面意見，再提大會討論。雷秘書長震報吿出席會員卅二人，王世杰·鄧穎超二會員請假。臨時主席孫科，即宜布繼續討淪未完之政府組織問題，及今日講題施政綱領問題，請各會員發表意見。梁澣溟氏首先發言，重提地方政權問題，　置於（改組政府案）中。當時討論議程，即轉入施政綱領問題。黃炎培氏希望政府很據抗戰建國綱領，先提出一施政綱領草案，以便研討。張申府氏謂民主同盟方面之草案，尙未擬就，並謂政協會議之主要任務，乃在產生一共同綱領，至於綱領之內容與形式爲（一）條文不可太多，（二）非完全原則的，　稍爲具體。內容須包括政治·經濟·軍事·外交·敎育·學術·文化·社會·救濟·善後復員等項。關於綱領之產生問題，張氏以爲由政府提出，或由恊商方式產生均可。</p>
<p>吳　城氏發言，謂今日討論施政綱領，各方未提方案，討論甚爲困難，本人欲提出施政綱領之方式與原則之意見；（一）不分門類，在此過渡時期，凡是應實行而可能行者，可列爲商括之條文。（二）倣照抗戰建國綱領體式，分爲政治·軍事·外交·敎育·經濟等部門，每部門定爲若十方針。（三）本人昨日參加一座談會，曾開若十會外人士謂，政協會議旣非依照法律而召集，會員又非民選，其性質　無異於一黨派會議，甚至批評吾人爲「分　會議」。參加政協會議之大多數，旣係黨派分子，不如直截了當將共同綱領改爲（政治協定），如英國戰時聯合內閣，各政黨所定之一類協定，此爲會外人士之意見，並報吿以供參考。至於綱領內容，應遵守國父所訂之建國大綱，而抗戰建國綱領，及國民黨六全大會通過之政綱政策，與國民參政會通過之三十五年度旅政方針，均可作爲討論之根據。現各方旣無提案，最好先作廣泛之交換意見，再交小組研究，提出大會討論。</p>
<p>董必武氏提出共產黨對于施政綱領之王張爲；（一）和平建國基本方針，（二）人民自由權利，（三）擴大國民政府基礎，（四）籌開國民大會，（五）地方自治，（六）軍事改革，（七）復員善後問題，（八）財政經濟之改革，（九）文化敎育改革，（十）國際和平及安全。董氏並逐一說明以上各點。</p>
<p>會議至此，休十息五分鐘，纔續討論關於綱領之名稱問題。章伯鈞，常乃德，黃炎培三氏，主張稱爲和平建國綱領。章氏並說明制訂綱領，係爲解決當前問題，及奠定將來行憲基礎，而達成承先啓後之任務。常乃德氏代表靑年黨，提出施政綱領之意見，其原則爲（一）簡要勝于舖張，（二）現實重于理論，（三）除弊重于興利。內容要點着重顧及（一）國家的統一與安定，（二）中國對世界之責任，（三）整個制度的配合與運用，（四）民主自由之基本保障，（五）人民的經濟能力與扶植，（六）敎育文化之充分發展。至於綱領之起草與討論方式，應以抗戰建國綱領爲藍本，並推定五人起草，提出大會。內容分別親定人民權利保障，中央政治的改革，地方自治問題，復員救濟，財政金融之整理，生產事業之扶助等事項。常氏並謂：該項綱領前言中，須說朋國家至上，民族至上，實行民主政治，保持世界和平，爲憲政舖路，爲目前急需之撒旦施等意義·羅隆基氏謂：施政綱領之產生，係根據人民之需要。羅氏並對中共及靑年黨代表所提之綱領，有所評述。陳布雷氏强調在會議進行中，應保持平靜和諧精神，勿引用各種會外習用之不必要名詞，如「聯合政府」等等字樣，最好一律避免。因所謂（聯合政府），在民主國僅載時有此，前目組織中國不適用。關於和平建國綱領之名稱，再旣停止軍事衝突，則和平二字，已失其對象，似可簡稱爲建國綱領。再則，關於綱領由小組協商到擬成草案提出大會，應給予以較充裕之時問，因各方所提意見中，有涉及地方政府組織問題，此事較復雜，應待充分協商，使不妨碍國家之統一。而關於軍事一項，則應俟軍事小組商得解決後，始能決定在綱領中應否加入，及如何措詞始爲確當。最後烯望各方面將口頭陳述之意見，均有一書面案，提交秘書處，使小組協商時有所依據。張申府氏謂：此次會議不僅應產生一綱領，與確保其實行，並須由人民監督。李燭塵氏對解決農民困難，開發水利，振興農業，加强工業生產，促進工業建設等問題，闡述甚詳。傳斯年氏本欲發言，因時巳過午，聲明留待下次會議提出。黃炎培氏復提及綱領內容，認爲應注意地方政治，勞資糾紛等問題，及訓政時期約法·並謂本會議爲共謀國是，會外批評如分　等字樣，以後最好勿在會內提出。主席宣布各會員意見，俟根據紀錄，分組研究恊商後，再提大會討論。雷秘書長宣讀分組委員會名單，並定明日上午九時，舉行第六次會議，一時散會。</p>

<h3>五次會空氣和諧　討論內容均置重保障自由</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十五日電〕五次會議，討論施政綱領，各方均未提出具體方案。主席請各會員各提意見各方一致縣爲作成綱領，茶爲需要。綱領名稱，張申府首提「共同施政」，董必武說明中共已擬有和平建國綱領。陳布雷說，抗戰結束，和平二字無對象，主用建國綱領。綱領性質，認應爲實施憲政前過渡時期所共守者。張申府處認並非人民選出，懷疑商訂之綱領，是否合法。吳鐵城說明外界輿論，認爲係各黨派之政治協商。羅隆基大背英國大憲章，證明卽爲各黨協定者，亦可合法。各會員對原則與內容，發言甚多。常乃德提簡要，現實，除弊三原則，甚得贊同。各方所提內容，　及甚廣，包括政治，財政，經濟，軍事，外交，善後救濟，文化，敎育等問題，而均以保障人民自由爲中心。至於綱領案，黃炎培一再主張，由政府先提出。吳鐵城提出建國大稱，國民黨六全大會政治綱領，國參會卅五年度國家施政方針，抗戰建國綱領，可作起草案據。章伯鈞提出應加國民政府的法，及各黨派政綱，作爲參攷很據。張申府提議，綱領應有序曾。常乃德主張前言應包括（一）國家至上，民族至上，（二）全民政治，（三）保障世界和平，（四）實施憲政之準備，（五）目前緊要之措施等意義。至於起軍方法，則尙待協商。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十五日電〕（一）會塲上宏論頻發，空氣茶爲好諧活潑。（二）申張府發言，眾申民主同盟非政黨者，尙望各盟員發言，對則屬同盟，錯則各自負責。（三）董必武報吿共黨提議內容時，說人民自由，應包括罷工及示威遊行。某大報男記者問某小報女記者，有沒有罷課自由。（四）工業家李燭塵疾呼說，工廠工潮不得解決，請黨派退出工廠活動。（五）李燭塵提議，國農民工，侃侃而談，希望政府用大力，作大事，謀大利，勿與人民爭小利。（六）各方面說到改　農民生活時，都提到二五减租，但雄辯善辭的羅隆基，却錯說成了二五加租。（七）主席宣布休息一刻鐘，會員多出塲如廁。王雲五說，我們在此等等公共汽車罷。（八）羅隆基聽到有人引用外間批評，中有許多贓字眼時，要大家不要用分贓一類刺耳字樣。陳布雷謂，刺耳二字亦刺耳。（九）董必武今日提政綱時，對工業建設之　議，承認爲外行。（十）主席請傅斯年發言，他看鐘已零時卅分，因　遜日，時間過長，今天不說。惟爲參加小組事，又要講話。張　拿起皮包，大呼時間不足了嗎，何必！（十一）周恩來今日未發　，僅在曹必武報吿時，離座　痰一次。</p>
<h3>軍事調處部迅速行動　派三人小組飛熱　傳達命令停止赤峯區衝突</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕軍事調處執行部頃發表第一號公報云，最近成立之軍事調處執行部，今日迅速行動，以停止熱河省赤峰地區衝突，今晨派遣三人和平小組，携帶停火命令，飛往該地。三委員抵此，不過一天半，停止衝空突命令在重慶發出，亦僅六日，執行部已開始行動，實現其停止國民政府與共產黨間衝突之任務，赤峰地區雙方之部隊，恐因通訊破報，尙未接到停火命令，今晨美國陸戰隊戰門機，曾在該地投擲傳單，督促雙方停止衝突，並於傳單內要求赤峯共產黨領導之軍隊，準備好當地機塲，以備和平小組C-47式機降落。小組人員爲谷漢禮少校，代表國民政府，×××代表共產黨，杜第洛上校代表美軍，該組携帶王週在重慶發表之停火命令，彼等將先飛錦州，取得杜章明將軍司令部之直接命令，因在熱河之國府軍，屬杜將軍指揮。彼等並携有三委員簽署之信函，要求予以保護及帮助，該組於提出彼等之訓令復，將調查該衝突地區情况，報吿執行部本部。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安十四日電〕軍事調處執行部中共方面代表十三人，由中共前往駐渝辦事處主任李克農率領，今晨乘C47型美國運輸機飛往北平，協助葉劍英執行停止軍事突及恢復交通命令。李克農將在北任軍事調處執行部秘書。</p>
<h3>共軍違反停戰令　仍在蘇魯豫晋各地進攻</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十五日加急電話〕令日共軍在津浦北段之臨城仍有行動，一般觀察，事實上之停戰程序，將起始於華北，終於蘇北。因軍事調處執行部旣遠在北平，且尙在組織布置中，欲望在平漢。津浦沿綫以及皖東北，豫西南之山嶽地區乃至蘇北沼澤地帶之共軍守信重諾，立刻停止其政勢，實無異痴人說夢。即使延安之停戰命令確已發出，何人能保證延安之命令祗有一套，實一疑問。今日京中公正人士僉信，共軍所發之停戰命令，已使人目爲之眩，但不須悲觀，蓋鑒政府最近公布共軍在津浦北段及晉北，蘇北等地繼續採取軍事行動之消息後，新華日報旣未加以聲辯，周恩來亦未大聲呌囂，殆已諉諸命令尙未到遠，不妨討點小便宜。共軍不於此寳責時機，爭取民心，迅速停戰，殊覺可惜。如軍事調處執行部之工作不能迅速由北而南，推進至皖·蘇，臘盡冬殘，霆江南北之難民，即難免多吃幾天寃枉虧，最低要求烯望羅賓遜·鄭介民·葉劍英三人能於最短期間取道津浦路至南京一行。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕軍委曾發言人十五日發表談話稱：據新華日報十四日刊載「停戰令發出第三日，九十四軍侵佔豐潤」，十五日該報續刊戴停戰時限滿期以後，豫南國民黨軍進攻光山等消息及中共代表辦事處發表十四日電所稱，熱河，河北等國軍進攻仍未停止各節，統屬不顧停止衝突最後期限〔本月十三日下午十二時〕及事實之眞象如何，實屬遺憾，本會於十日晚將雙方同意停止衝突恢復交通商定辦法電令各部隊恪切遵行後，先後接到陸軍總部何兼總司令，各行營，行　主任及綏靖公署主任，各戰區司令長官，方面軍司令，各警備總司令，衛戌總司令，各省政府主席，各集團軍總司令，各軍長等電報呈復，全國各地均已遵限責旅。復據各部隊長報吿，共產黨軍隊仍於停止衝突最後限期〔本月十三日下午十二時〕已滿之後，十四日繼續在蘇北，山東，山西，東北，豫南等地大規模進攻，各該地部隊長紛紛電請轉知中共負責人，迅速有效制止，爲使巨人明瞭起見，茲半共產黨部　在停止衝空規定時限滿限後進攻各地情形，分誌於次：</p>
<p>（甲）在停止衝突規定時限（十三日下午十二時止）內，共產黨軍隊進攻情形（略），</p>
<p>（乙）在停止衝突規定時限滿限後，共產黨隊進攻情形，蘇北方面：（一）共產軍新四軍糾集五六團，於十四日晨向姜堰鎭以西（泰縣東）政府軍隊猛攻。營長一員及士兵多人被繫斃，現仍續攻中·（二）共產軍十四日晨繼續攻佔隴海路東段大廟車站，幷將該車站機器枕木燒燬。（三）十四日共產軍繼續圍攻新安鎭。</p>
<p>山東方面：（一）共產軍十四日團攻兗州·臨城·傳山益猛。（二）十四日晨共產軍分別向膠濟路之周村·張店攻撃。（三）十四日上午三時·津浦綫臨城至韓莊迄臨棗支綫，共產軍曾一度停止攻擊，跟汪韓莊前綫共產軍幷送信至政府軍隊，略謂：我等（共產軍自稱）已奉停戰命令，假如國軍襲擊，則將自衛等語，但至同日下午三時，共產軍復又攻擊棗荘及棗莊煤礦，迄至二十四小時，仍向各地政府軍隊攻擊中。</p>
<p>豫南方面：（一）政府軍隊於停止衝突規定限期前，即已進入光山城，據孫蔚如司令長官報吿，十三日光山城內並無共產軍一兵一卒，可見新華日報所稱國民黨軍在停止衝突時限滿期以後仍攻光山城，全屬虛構。（二）十四日拂曉，共產軍李先念部主力，由定遠店（羅山南三十五公里）向羅山以南政府軍隊一八五師猛烈攻擊，該師因恪遵命令，停止衝突，未予還擊，致遭甚大損失，不得已乃撒至信陽東南三十五公里處地區。</p>
<p>豫北方面：（二）共產軍於十四日下午九時，分向安陽，修武兩地增加部隊，同時加緊圍攻該兩城</p>
<p>山西方面：（一）共產軍太行軍區第二分區之第廿八團，廿九團，卅團共二千餘附砲多門，由該分區司令魯瑞林指揮，於十四日晨圍攻正太路檢次東北卅里之什貼鎭，至下午四時許共產軍增至四千餘，圍攻益猛。（二）共產軍部隊，於十四日晨向晉東南之武鄕屬分水嶺攻擊。（三）共產軍二千餘，於十四日晨向同蒲路西側汾陽縣城進迫中。（四）共產軍現仍向中陽·交城·曲沃·翼城等地圍攻。（五）共產軍現對山西交通綫仍大肆破壞。以上各節，均爲共產軍隊未能遵照停止衝突之規定，於滿限後仍在各地繼續進攻，而政府軍隊則恪遵命令，一再忍讓，事實昭然，至其所謂國軍於停戰後進入光山一節，又係完全虛構，除將上述事實通知軍事調處執行鄧處理外，本會本擬不予發表，以示政府容忍及停止衝突之決心，但以共黨報紙抹殺事實，反誣國軍，故不得不予以批　。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東北隨軍記者十五日電〕據今日此間聲稱：十三日午夜東北各地停止衝突命令發出以後三小時，共軍發動反攻，奪回營口。按國軍係於五日前克復該城，又據指稱：共軍五千同時違反停止衝突命令，攻佔溝帮子，營口鐵路沿綫之盤山，但本日國軍已將共軍撃退，完全佔領該地。據報，共軍進攻營口時，駐防該處之少數國軍曾加抵抗，以圖保全該城，結果略有死傷，共軍人數至少五倍於國軍，初時僅小衝突，旋擴大爲大規模戰爭。</p>
<h3>徐堪今日飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕糧食部長徐堪，定十六日由渝飛京，糧部次長鹿松舟，擬待徐部長到京會商要政後，溯江至皖。贛等省一行。皖南民衆代表來京，向糧部請求酌減配額暨改善收糧運繼辦法，嚴懲基層徽糧之不肖公務員，糧部已全部接受，待徐部長到京後會商解決。</p>
<h3>各公債到期票財部恢復償付</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕財部對收復區人民所持該部發行各種公債之到期本息票，分別恢復償付，以維持票人之權益，其辦法如次：（一）自三十年起所發之各種公債，計有三十年軍需及建設公債，三十一年同盟勝利美金及國幣公債，三十二年同盟勝利公債等到期息檣及中籤債票，自即日起恢復兌付。（二）三十年以前發行之各種公債，其到期本息票，應俟另行辦理。聞上兩項辦法，該部已電中央銀行國庫局轉知收復區各經理銀行遵辦，並分電各區財政金融特派員布吿週知，</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州十四日電〕僞廣東華橋聯合會會長李逆超羣，被判處死刑。</p>

<h3>三千工廠剩軀殻　三年之內尚難全部恢復</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十三日電）日本在東北十四年來之建設，全部精華皆在瀋陽，此亦即東北三千五百萬同胞十四年來之血汗結晶。鐳陽工業之高度淸展，據專家研究，已凌駕其本國之上，日本集中精力建設之結果，迄至上年，已獲得遠東輕工業之首位，日人在潘陽三千餘大規模工廠中之投資總額，迄無法獲悉，但有一事可說明者，即總額的佔其在國內工業投資總額之半數以上。日本投降後之三日內，瀋陽所有工廠，完整無損，不幸旋即遭受破壞，全部精華付諸一炬，日本在瀋陽所經營之工廠，舉其大者約三千餘，計分（一）鐵路西區，四百八十九廠。（二）大東區廠四百餘，（三）人北區包括海城區廠三百餘，（四）小西區廠三百餘，（五）南市區二百餘廠，（六）北市區二百餘廠，（七）其他市區三百餘廠，鐵西區工廠林立，百分之九十廠屋盡成空殻，窗門亦均被拆去。大東區工廠進焚燬，熖息尙存，大北區，小西區，但見破碎機件，凌亂滿地，重大機件均已不存，南北市區之工廠房屋，塌臥於深雪中模糊莫辨。據專家稱：今日欲求恢復瀋陽全部工廠，恐非三年內之事，瀋陽市府爲求供應米麥，頃正設法將碾米及麵粉兩工廠開工，另有少數工廠，亦可能先予恢復。</p>

<h3>法企圖進兵河內　故放緊張空氣　法帝國統越南八十載　河道不修造成連年飢饉</h3>
<p>〔聯合社河內十四日電〕此間今日空氣異常緊張，全市十八萬人口中，法國人的佔二萬，中國佔領軍當局禁止其携帶武器，但維明共和國之武裝安南士兵，則可在市內自由往來，法國人越南銀行河內支行董事貝林近曾在白晝遇刺。法國方面發言人稱：「整個北部陷入無政府狀態，市內無警察，煤源斷絕，火車停頓。由法國人觀點言之，自日本投降以來，東京省情勢未見改善。苟准許吾人調遺軍隊來此。則短時期內即可恢復秩序」云·中國軍隊何日撤退，此間現尚無何種迹象可尋。</p>

<p>歐打法人風潮平息　〔中央社河內十二日專電〕三日來河內市區所發生毆打法人事件之糾紛，今日已完全平息，此實由於負責治安之中國軍事當局努力之結果。緣自日軍投降，英法軍開入越南南部，由於英法印軍紀律之不良部分軍事負責人處置之不當，致自去歲九月中旬造成連續不斷之華僑受難事件，使南圻僑胞蒙受刦掠死亡及無法統計之損失。北圻僑胞以激於義憤，商織以爲聲搜，組織　助南圻僑胞修案大會，不料三日前樣語一出，即被法人撕毀，因此發生衝突。此時越革命份十以有機可乘，一時遂轉爲越人打法人，三日來法人遭歐者越十餘起之多。此種不幸事件，駐越之我軍事當局引爲遺憾，我軍自進入越北受降以來，對法越雙方向持兼　不　之態度，今鑒於僑胞民氣激昂，故立即勸令僑　顧全大局，停止一切活動，現原定舉行之　應死難僑胞大會與遊行，均不舉行。</p>

<h3>和平統一投射萬丈光芒　協商會揭開新頁</h3>
<p>中華民國卅五年一月十日上午十時，是一個新的歷史開始的時問，全國人　望着的政治協商會議，在重慶開幕了。</p>
<p>巴山新雨後，國民政府裏的四處花木，分外靑蒼鮮艷，拱托着那代表無限崇高的　巍殿堂，氣象十格外莊麗。禮堂中，棗紅窗幔低連，黃絨地毯厚重而溫軟。主席台上的茶花，笑　迎人。</p>
<p>國府門前排列的儀仗隊，向每一位代表肅致敬禮。三十八位代表除張君勱莫德　爾先生尙未返渝外，都坐善秘書處撥借的小汽車很早趕來。七十五歲的老翁邵從恩先生，仍然是由前次的一位小姐攙扶着，聽鍾的邁步走上台階，步人會塲。</p>
<p>張羣周恩來着了先鞭　張岳軍和周恩來兩先生是在會議開始之前趕到，早晨八點鐘，他們在怡園馬歇爾特使的官邸中的一間小客應裏，進行停戰令簽字的商談，因此當他們走進會塲的時候，全塲都注視着張岳軍先生的滿面笑容，這笑容，組會議帶來了無必限的歡喜。</p>
<p>代表們的座位分兩列四排，後面是新開記者和特別來賓席。</p>
<p>蔣主席入塲掌聲雷鳴　當全體與會人員坐定後，蔣主席在熱烈的鼓堂聲中，由會塲右角門內，步入會塲。主席穿着草緣色軍服，雪白的手套，烏亮的皮靴，威武煥發，滿面慈悅的神采，照耀着整個會塲。一時間，除了　光的起落，和攝影機的聲音以外，整個會塲的注意力，完全凝聚在主席微笑着的面孔上。他向各代表頻頻點頭，徐步登上講台。</p>
<p>停戰令發表全塲歡忻　秘書長雷霆報告人數，會議開始：</p>
<p>主席恭讀國父遺囑，在致詞中，首先以淸晰而歡欣的聲音說：「關於停止軍事衝突的商談，已經得到結果，停戰命令，今天就可以發出。」這有如一聲春雷，使全塲掌聲，像萬花齊放。水銀燈白光閃閃，每一個人臉上都因這喜訊而閃着歡圻耀眼的光彩</p>
<p>主席在致詞的最後，又宣佈保障人民自由等四件即刻要實施的大事，使在座各黨派代表一致崇仰感奮，熱烈的鼓掌聲，長久不停。在這表現着無限崇敬熱烈長久的鼓掌聲中，主席走下講台，在右列的第一席坐下。</p>
<p>老人大呼籲聽衆動容　接着，是共產黨代表周恩來，青年黨代表曾琦致詞，無黨派代表邵從恩老先生，更以老邁動人的聲音高呼：「道個會議只許成功，不許失敗，所謂成功是國家的成功，民族的成功！」他並且說：「從恩今年七十五歲，扶病來此，今天是垂涕而道。」傾聽着這位老先生爲國是的呼聲，全塲無不感動。</p>
<p>會議告結束新史展開　十一時三十五分會議結束了，中國和平統一的歷史新頁，却從這時候起開始展開。</p>
<h3>刧餘民生輪　協助復員運輸工作</h3>
<p>民国十四年在嘉陵江上游產生之民生公司，最初着手於航業，募集資本五萬元，向上海訂造淺水油輪一艘，長七五呎，寬一四呎，深五呎，馬力九〇四，十五年夏完成，取名「民生」，冒洪水危險，上駛長江上游，開始駛行重慶合川間。</p>
<p>試辦航運客運貨運兼顧</p>
<p>民生於開始經營時，爲避免與正在失敗之同業競爭，故決經營新闢之嘉陵江重慶至合川錢，且一般同業均以貨運爲主，航期不定，民生改以客運爲主，試辦定期航行，以利乘客。惟至枯水時季，江水低落，無法行駛，乃創開長江重慶至涪陵綫，雖旅客較少，但兼有貨運，營業尙稱不惡，對於涪陵繁榮，有相當貢獻。同時，決加造更淺油輪一艘，期能終年行通重慶合川綫。十七年新造一船抵渝，渝合綫遂每日有船來往，當時重慶缺少修理廠，乃在渝自設一機器廠，解決修理困難，嗣又購得稍大淺水輸一艘，遂以三輪駛行渝合，渝涪兩綫，並以船員之努力，辦到每日有船開駛，在枯水時，以一船駛重慶至宜寅，民十八年，四川善後督辦劉甫澄，感覺當時航業有整理之必要，堅邀盧總經理出任川江航務管理處處長。</p>
<p>盧總經理辭航務處職務回公司後，將繼公司由合川移至重慶，當时各輪華商輪公司仍極散漫，各自爲政，業務極爲蕭條，民生公司知長江上游航業問題，關係四川對外交通與未來開發至鉅，其垂危局面不容坐視不救，乃增加資本接收，負債累累，無力獨立經營之輪船，或洽商可以合併於民生之公司。民二十年與重慶宜賓間各公司商量，即於翌年合併公司，接收輪船十一隻。二十一年，進一步整理重慶宜昌間航業，在半年內接收輪船七隻，合併本國船公司四，英國船公司一，航綫延展至上海。又接收宜渝間船三隻，合併本國船公司三，購太古沉在水底輪船一艘，救起自加修理復購美孚行停申輪一艘。又逾一年，接收美籍捷江公司船五隻，至是除英商太古。怡和·日商·德商·法商·聚福·招商·及三北外，行駛長江上海之華商輪船乃呈一較爲整齊劃一之局勢。</p>
<p>困難雖多竟創三段航行</p>
<p>一，民生自收買大量輪船後，那遇一極大困難，因所收各船均年久失修，且一部份簡直不適於航行，須澈底改造，乃將其速率慢者裝貨，少者用煤特多者，或加接長，或改良船壳，或用其機器鍋爐另造船壳，使儘量加大速率增高用煤減少。</p>
<p>該公司於廿六年，曾竭全體人員之力，調集大小輪船，分三段航行，維交通於不斷，創長江上游航業史上聞名之「三段航行」。</p>
<p>戰端一開民生任務加重</p>
<p>二十六年抗戰開始時，民生所胡輪船，除尙有七隻在船塢中未及完成外，大小共有輪船四十六艘，總噸二萬四千餘噸。當時江陰封鎖上海隔斷，一部份杞憂者認爲民生公司生命即將吿終，然民生則認定國家對外戰爭之開始，即該公司任務之開始，故首先動員參加戰爭。至廿八年，已有輪船三七艘，共三萬六千餘噸。當南京漢口宜昌相繼撤退時，民生曾全力以赴，撤退政府人員及公物，學校師生及圖書儀器以及避難之人民等，又各兵工廠鋼鐵廠航空器材，民間工廠之後撤，第一期一萬二千噸，在兩月內完成，第二期八萬噸以上在大半年間，運達宜昌。兩個月後全部人員器材，均離宜西運。當時船隻，無一日停頓，無一時枉費，因上游水急灘險，利用白畫航行，夜間裝卸，船到碼頭艙口早已揭開，起重機亦已舉起，兩岸器材，預裝駁船待裝，船方到達拋錐未定，即由拖輪拖至船邊裝貨，工人則每數人或數十人爲一隊，在歌聲中日夜工作，歌聲與輪上起重機聲汽笛鳴呌聲相配和，合成一悲壯之交響曲，表現出國人動員抗敵之力量，其緊張情况堪與「敦刻爾刻」相比擬。</p>
<p>各地撤退完成，民生仍担負後方水上軍運並及一般交通，票費運費，早由政府限定，惟開支則無法限定，千百倍上漲，致入不敷出。收支失衡。抗戰以後，歷年虧折，支持堅苦。主要輪船及船員，亦犧牲甚多。</p>
<p>投資事業不斷大量擴展</p>
<p>航業爲民生公司主要事業，伴航業而发展者爲機器業，即直接經營之民生機器廠，戰後發展至能勝任全部輪船之修理，並新造十餘艘新船機器廠房，大量擴充，爲避免敵機空襲，除向周圍疏散外，並在山中開闢極大之防空洞工塲，可在空襲時照常工作，爲後方唯一最大之民營機械廠，且爲僅有之鍋爐製造廠。民生間接投資者最早爲煤礦協助嘉陵江若干煤礦建築一輕便鐵道，組成川北鐵路公司，並促成各礦合組爲天府礦業公司獲中福公司之機器與材料，將礦山加以機械化，每日產煤運煤逾千噸，供給戰時首都及民生用煤各三分之一以上</p>
<p>瘡痍之餘尚冀多所建設</p>
<p>八年辛苦，一朝勝利，民生公司輪船首先運送國軍及復員人員，往宜昌·漢口·甫京·上海各埠。民生現有水陸職工共六千餘人，船隻八十餘艘，巳不足三萬噸，能行駛渝申綫者已不足二千艘。該公司在未達壯年，即任抗戰中之堅苦任務，且有助於國家，希望各界多賜扶導，俾瘡痍之餘，得以迅速發展前進，以增强我復興與建設。（克增）</p>
<h3>萬種醜態哄傳羊城　公審陳逆鴻慈</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派員　梁風</p>
<p>報章上皴露了七日上午公審大漢奸陳逆鴻慈的消息後，即時哄動了全個廣州城，因爲這是公開審訊漢奸第一宗的案件，而且難都想去看看，這個曾經做過僞廣東高等法院院長還兼僞綏靖公署軍法處處長，他過去不但是「汪記班」襄的一個紅員，在這地方還握着生死大權的人物，今天也會站在他盤据五年，坐在高高的公案上審問過千萬人的老地方，而淪爲階下之囚，被人審訊，看他究竟是一副怎樣的臉？</p>
<p>鷹鼻鼠眼老奸巨滑顯原形</p>
<p>時間到了！主審推事，陪審推事，檢察官書記官，穿着那莊嚴的官服，魚貫出庭。法警也持着傳票將陳逆鴻慈帶入，他好不容易通過大門前擠滿的人羣，數百人的目光，都電似的集中在這個焦點上；原來漢奸也會知羞恥，他俯首而進，像很知道規矩的走到庭中被吿的位置站立，向主審官深深地行一鞠躬禮，不知他見到坐在上面的法官，作何感想？</p>
<p>在萬目睽　下的陳逆，是一個身長六呎的高個子，他穿了一件古銅色的長棉抱，外罩灰色長衫，足御中式革履，頭髪已半禿而班白，面部滿是皺紋，眉目和咀角均下垂，右　上微微有點鼓起，那細小的眼睛透露出狡猾的光芒，從他那鷹勾的鼻子，和那鎭定的態度，可以看出了他是個老奸巨滑的傢伙。</p>
<p>大罵汪逆使聽者特別剌耳</p>
<p>主審官詢問過他的年齡籍貫之後，地就用着稍帶口吃而仍不失健朗的聲音有秩序地陳訴着他的歷史和自欺欺人的漢奸謬論。</p>
<p>「六十四歲，番禺人，在前淸光緒卅年，張人駿做兩廣督學時，我考取官費留東生，朱執信。胡漢民。古應芬，李文範和汪逆精衛等六十人都是我的同學……」當他說到汪逆精衛時，不禁全堂哄笑。誰都感到從一個漢奸的口　　出了一　「　」字，是特別刺耳而好笑，他似乎忘記了自己也是逆，公然會罵汪「逆」，如此　態，祇博得大家一陣　笑，他居然沒有半點　態，仍明淅地叙述下去：</p>
<p>知法犯法自稱十開車老法官</p>
<p>「出國四年，光緒三十四年學成回國，在慶東法政學堂任敎習，民元年胡漢民任粵督時，我被任都督府軍法局畏。民二年袁世凱稱帝，我被通緝。而斯時龍濟光據粵，與袁聲氣相投，我祇好出走，隨着朱執信，鄧仲元諸先主做革命工作於港澳兩地。民三年雲南起義，通緝令取消，論觀內絕。民九　　廈高要審判廈廳長。民十一年，國父來粵，　陳烱明叛變，即麓謝父旅居上海，十五年返粵，任行政官，曾署樂品，騙江，三水，東蕘各縣篆·十六年淸黨後，重返司法界，歷任　羅，潮梅，汕頭地方法院院長。至二十一年辭職，統計歷任法官，的有十年歷史了。」當他說到　國父時，就馬上立正，大家賭此裝模作樣的怪狀，不禁又是一陣哄笑。同時說到任法官約有十年歷史，大家都以鼻嗤之，大概以他旣知法而犯法，眞是枉爲人吧。</p>
<p>口吃發抖只承認觀念氏誤</p>
<p>主當以　作語讓住大衆的笑聲，問：「你何時加入僑組織？何故要加入償組織？」答：「二十九年八月　廣州，九月一日就）　騙，那時偽省市府已成　立四月了，（他加強語調彷彿做漢奸非本意，不然早該返內地了！）說來很慚愧，因被飢寒所迫，當我在香港時，汪逆人使送信給我，要我帮忙成立司法機構，並說他與中央沒有脫離關係，回來是爲救國救民的，因此我就上了汪逆的大當。」</p>
<p>間：「附逆是罪大惡極的，你何以不考慮淸楚？二假若你回後方，中央不會不給你飯吃！」</p>
<p>他面目有點尷尬，口吃地並帶顫抖的聲音回答：「這是我的觀念錯誤，這是由於我以前迷信汪逆的人格所致。」</p>
<p>口沫橫飛要求庭上判無罪</p>
<p>主審再追問：「日人侵略中國，口頭說「共存共榮」，其實很多專實可以看出它的陰謀，你何以不反正過來？」</p>
<p>「我始終相信汪逆的話是眞的，且我也沒有做危害國家民族的事。」陳逆倔强地辯着，並舉出在他任內日方會派顯間及連絡官來千涉司法，均遭他嚴詞拒絕的「功績」。主審官便幽默地說道；「日人發不講理，他管你是誰；而且，在軍法處是不是審訊反日救國的間諜和游擊隊的案件？」</p>
<p>陳逆趕快聲明道：「軍法處所審的都是盜竊案，關於反日政治案件統由警務處審訊，而且軍法處僅有審判權而無決定權」。他把這次犯罪，強辯爲祇有犯罪的「行爲」，而無犯罪的「意思」，是受了汪逆所網而已，然並淺有憑藉敵僞的勢力來欺詐，反有「救　救民」的事實，說來好像理直氣壯，有聲有色，拳臂亂舞，口沬橫飛，漢奸的動態畢　，最後還無恥地要求宣吿無罪，並呈上親笨的答辯書，洋洋數千言。</p>
<p>被告律師不甘爲漢奸辯護</p>
<p>被吿的律師陳啓培，這時也在律師席上站起來，他祇呈上了申辯，顯然他是不願出庭代國人共棄的漢奸來申辯的。</p>
<p>陳逆捧看他的供詞时，兩手不斷地在發抖。簽供過後，主審官宣佈辯論無法終結，候期再審，退堂！陳逆沮喪地，也就在萬目睽睽中被押了下去。</p>
<p>陽光照在這看來平凡但却有着無上權成的刑事法庭，大家諦聽了兩個多鐘頭的「妙論」，現在才　了口氣。記者們收抬好了筆記本子，相互發出會心的微笑，這精彩的一幕，就此完結！（元月八日於廣州）</p>
<h3>唇槍舌劍首次楞商會瑣記　濮德不合時宜寄自陪都　從激戰中覓取和平　張羣的幽默風度</h3>
<p>在協商會議第一次大會席上，張羣爽朗地幽默地說：「政府爲了求取協議的成功，最後又把赤峯和多倫作了讓步條件，以達成中共無條件停止衝突的願望」。王世杰站起來說，「上次毛澤東先生來重慶，一談談了四十三天，協商會議一擱擱了兩個月，但願這次十四天就能够用」記者猜想，大概王外長還牽掛着倫敦的會議也說不定。</p>
<p>謎樣的十三省區　由於曾琦的質詢，周恩來將現有衝突的十三個省區（據中央社報道）背了一下，不過記者和另外幾個同業在那裏好像只聽見十二個，不知孰是孰非，現在只好以中央社的報道爲準。這也許由於各人「聽覺不同」所致？梁漱溟和曾琦辯論，發言十九次，拂袖離座者也有數次。按照新的心理學說，一個人的精神狀態，卅三天循環一次，大概他恰在低潮期吧。我們願意聽舌戰，怕聽槍響。「君子動口不動手」，這不是阿Q作風，這是現代民主作風。</p>
<p>格萊斯頓的拳痕　據說英國下院的情形更熱開，有一張議席上還留有格萊斯頓的拳頭痕印呢！何况這在中國才是新的開始！從舌戰中求取和平，從不同中尋出共同，這正是協商，這正是協商會議應循的路子！（元月十一日夜，重慶）</p>
<h3>五十開車奮鬥八年抗戰成果　東北展開新形勢</h3>
<p>— 蔣君章　本報特約稿　下篇</p>
<p>中蘇同盟　開羅宣言和波茨坦宣言，是原則的確定，而中蘇友好同盟條約，乃是具體的確定，因爲英美和東北都是距離遼遠，只有蘇聯的領土和東北相鄰接，而過去更有一段錯綜複雜的外交關係，故中蘇條約所給與中國收回東北之便利，其重要性尙較開羅宣言與波茨坦宣言爲大。</p>
<p>條約本身　中蘇友好同盟條約，於本年八月十四日簽字於莫斯科，條約內容，共分五項，另外附有蘇聯和中國來往的照會各二件。茲掇述其要點</p>
<p>友好間盟條約的本身，共八條，其主要的宗旨是共同擊敗日本和防止日本復起侵略。基於此項宗旨，所以有軍事的合作，基地的共同使用和鐵路的共同經營。此外又約定不單獨與日媾和，不加入反對集團等。</p>
<p>長春鐵路　關於長春鐵路的協定，共十八條，其主要宗旨爲尊重彼此之權益，加强兩國之友好關係與經濟聯繫，其辦法爲該鐵路之共管共營，三十年後歸還中國。其範圍則包括中東路與南滿路，即帝俄時代之東淸路幹支綫。</p>
<p>大連協定　關於大連的協定，共六條（並附一議定書），蘇聯承認大連爲中國不可分離之一部份，行政權屬於中國，規定出入口自由，蘇聯貨物之通過給予便利或優待，有效期間亦爲三十年。</p>
<p>旅順協定　關於旅順的協定共九條，定該港爲中蘇共同使用，以防日本再起侵略的海軍根據地。該地區之防護，由中國政府委託蘇聯辦理之，行政則歸中國，市區行政人員之任免，則由中國徽得蘇聯同意時爲之，有效期間亦爲三十年。另有附件，則爲規定旅順之水面。</p>
<p>東北蘇軍　關於蘇軍進入東三省之協定，共七條，規定蘇軍因對日作戰進入東北後，如何由國民政府建立機構，實施統治，及其與蘇軍統帥合作之辦法。另附紀錄一項，載明蘇軍於日本投降後三星期內開始撤退，並以最多三個月爲完成撤退之期。（按此項開始撤兵期限，今已有所變更。）</p>
<p>此外，蘇聯政府又來照會兩件，其第一件中更聲明：「對中國在東三省之主權重由尊重，並對其領土與行政完整重申承認。」蘇政府並申明所予中國以這義上與軍需品及其他物資之援助」完全供給中央政府即國民政府。」</p>
<p>中國主權　在這個條約中，我們可以說，東北是有條件的收回了，這個條件成立的基礎，是對日作戰和防止日本再起。這個條件的性質，和帝俄時代的東淸鐵路和旅大租借地，也是不同，其相異之點有二：一爲行政權仍屬中國，而且蘇聯對於此點更作特別申明；二爲共同經營與共同使用，凡此二點都是友好同盟條約中的進步之點，也可以說明蘇聯對中國態度友好的一般情况。</p>
<p>美國功勳　此外，又有一點，爲我人所不能不知者，即關於此項條約之成立，美國的促成，有不可磨滅之功，此可於美國前任駐華大使赫爾利將軍的報吿書中見之。這一點可以說明，美國希望中美友好，但更願意中蘇友好，在事實上，東方的和平，也惟有中美蘇三國的友好與合作，始有維持之可能？中蘇條約把這次中日戰爭導火綫的東北問題，作一具體解決，更足證中蘇兩國之接受此項傾向。</p>
<p>確保成果　現在，我要下一結語了。由上所述，可知東北是晚近國際政治上的重要問題，我們中國爲了東北問題已經奮鬥了五十年，李鴻章在無辦法中想出一個聯俄制日辦法，由於淸政府的無能和帝俄的野心，因此流弊滋多，而中國的政權僅達苟延殘喘的程度。由於這次長期抗戰的結果，我們取消了不平等條約，我們由積弱之國轉列於五强之林，這個東北問題也因爲勝利之故，而在法律上得到圓滿的解決。我們也曾說過，中共軍隊的進入東北，使接收工作發生挫折，由於這一點，我們可以知道團結一致，對於解決國家的問題，是如何的重要。我們爲東北問個奮鬥了五十年，才得到這一點成果，這個成果我們無論如何要堅決地保持得牢牢的。</p>
<p>殺菌燈下　革命性的美國藥物發明　新式配尼西林配製過程</p>
<p>美國實騐室內，藥劑師身穿制服，立於殺菌燈下以油與蚌蛋和入配尼西林內，用此種新式混合劑注射，可使配尼西林分量在血液內運行稍慢，可以减緩其吸收速率。因單用配尼西林注射，其在血液中，常發生激劇作用，而下降亦快，故須不斷注射，以期控制病菌之傳染。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>祥和光明還得努力</h3>
<p>這幾天，中國政局頓呈一片祥和光明氣象，較之三四個月以前，眞可說大有進步。但是試就一般大局和社會狀况，作深一層的靜觀默察，却似乎覺得此時的祥和光明，還祗在初期，而如何培養這種氣象尙有待於國人的繼被努力。</p>
<p>據本報北平專電，說羅賓遜鄭介民葉創英三氏將在協和醫院之協和空氣中，醫治華北之創傷。鄭旣力主不算舊帳，葉亦極願鄉村城市打成一片，好像談判九年所不能解次的，眞的就能在二三週內圓滿功德。要說祥和，誠然祥和之至。然而聽到馬歇爾特使破壞協議，負責檢舉的主張，却又令人茫然。古人說：大信無的。等到要約束，要檢舉，這個「信」字其實已經打了折扣。文中子所說「不言而信，」在今天到處難覓，不得已而求其次，但望能言而有信，已令人心滿意足。停止衝突令旣於十三日午夜生效，按理講，如果大家守信，還要什麼監督？還怕什麼破壞？還用得着什麼檢舉？可是徐州東北賈汪煤礦仍在那哀大遭破壞，臨城以北鐵路又被拆毀，哈山附近共軍依舊趕作工事，諸如此類，祥和中未免還夾帶些戾氣！</p>
<p>叉據重慶電傳，政協四次會議中，國民黨代表提出擴大國府組織案，在實施憲政前，先表示和衷共濟，開放政權，以示大公。至於保陣人民自由四項辦法，政府也限於十天內廢止或修正現行法令，期望趕快實施。偏有若于代表激昂慷慨，說必須先把後者在兩三天內辦到，否則不能討論政府改組問題，咄咄逼人，似乎不像協商態度。恕我們說句不甚中聽的話，「政協」原非政權行使機構，國民也未嘗授權於「政協，」今天國府之所以召集政協會議，無非想和各黨各派開誠商討，安慰人民，故政協諸公應該大家想着如何方對得起人民，而萬不可以爲國府應該對「政協」負責。要盼「政協」成功，只得奉勸大家一團和氣的協商，切莫常動肝火。如果一來拂袖而去，一來就不出席，老脾氣不改，一定學不會「民主風度，」而祥和氣象也必令人感到稀薄的了。</p>
<p>試再縱觀社會，他處姑不具論，即就上海二三近事來說，也覺得要祥和光明，還須十分努力。認眞懲處漢好，不但人民所渴望，也是政府的責任。但如何檢舉，如何偵查，如何審判，均有其法定的程序。民主國家，人民首貴有法治的素養，處理漢好案件亦無例外。祗須檢舉的人願負法律上的責任，自有高等法院爲之受理，共他任何機關至多祗能協助而非其主管，不必手忙脚亂，多所干預。而檢舉者也應該認淸途徑，負責呈訴，更不必採用羣衆運動這一套手法，徒使社會呈現一種似乎法律無靈的狀態，弄得收復區的人民似乎人人自危。但反過來說，應該負責檢舉的機關或主官，明知犯有漢奸嫌疑的人逍遙法外，不加追問，坐令人民憤慨，也不應該。隨手舉個例，譬如敎育部杭次長在京表示，決定懲治敎育界的漢奸，但我們不知道將挨到何時再來檢舉？中宣部接收了僞組織時期的電影機構，但電影界的漢奸究竟是那幾個人？又如承印偽教育部編訂的中小學敎科書，麻醉收復區靑年的，究竟是那些書局？由那些敗類主持？我們祗聽得一片接收書店的聲浪，却沒有看見檢舉過一個書業漢奸。像這株皂白不分，糊糊塗塗的拖下去，未必見得就是光明氣象。</p>
<p>物價騰貴，生活高昂，因此社會上瀰漫了增加學費，提高工資，和怠工罷工的空氣。我們應該承認人都是有理性的，也都需要食衣住行的。如果一部分人食衣住行的生活，連極低限度的水準都不够，而另一部分人則花天酒地，宴游享樂，社會上自然積有不平之氣。但從另一方面想，誠如吳開先氏所云，在今後國際商業競爭的環境中，如何能保障工人的生活和地位，必更感艱難。這艱難的前途，是整個中國的實業界所面對着的，不僅工人一方爲然。所以勞資雙方，惟有一心一德，相忍爲國，纔可渡此難關。假使見不到此，一味各走極端，則重慶工業界的厄運或將蔓延於上海，兩敗俱傷，究有何益！至於滬市私立學校下期增收學費一事，也頗値得注意．加得高，學生家長何能重加負担？失學子弟勢必加多。加得少，學校不够開支，敎師無以爲生．抗戰期間，公敎人員生活最艱，實則穿長袗，靠薪水者，無一　不愁眉苦臉。現在戰事結束，若聽任敎師仍然束緊肚皮，寗得謂平？中央及地方政府一方固宜規定私校的收費標準，而一方也該顧到敎師的生活維艱，不妨就敵偽產業處理之所得，或其他稅款中，酌提若干，撥充補助私校經費，指定津貼敎師，使私校敎師之待遇，和公立學校相差不遠。須知百年樹人，國家在計，政府萬不能怪吝這筆錢的。何況我們對於敎師，原屬一樣重視，不能冉在敎師之中，造成公私學校待遇顯著的不平。要希望社會上充滿祥和光明的氣象惟有從種種地方把不平的因素潛消於無形。不平則鳴，一切的祥和，一切的光明，都要從一平」字做起！</p>

<h3>金鈔均見小挫　公債亦起回風　華股恍惚外股轉跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨晨開即吿微挺，爲八八萬三，開後在八八萬內外徘徊殊久，迨後華股大戶脫股換金，一般游資亦來跟風，一時求過於供，驟見步漲至八九萬五，此際對美鈔之套價已升爲六〇五元對十兩，以致稍有脫金換鈔之流，籌碼較鬆，加之時近午刻，浮戶不堪持久，於是在賣戶活動下，午刻降至八六萬三，午後在八七萬內外盤旋，結果較前收回挫七千，銀樓飾金掛九萬四，紋銀七百元，銀元四百四左右，暗拆因有捲烟結款關係，烟兌業需用較繁，同時盛傳銀根行將抽緊之說，稍見緊張，息價站住一角至一角二分不等。</p>
<p>美鈔以證券帮中胃口不振，大戶遂鮮活動，散戶亦抱　望，市况　僅能追隨烚赤而已，套頭差價拔開至六〇五元左右，稍稍吸引套買，乃盤好至一，四六五元左右，午刻以金市回跌而跌，最後在一四四〇元徘徊，結果較前收微挫七元，港票有汕帮供給，該地合申市低至二一〇元，以致老貨新貨均因供給校殷而同跌，結果較前收計老貨跌五元，新貨跌一元。</p>
<p>公債脫手者較衆，市勢鬆動，其間因散戶游資之點綴，略有起仆，丙種開後曾見一四一〇元，大戶脫售公債，換購外股股，漲勢逍受挫折，乃盤跌至一二九五元，散戶尙來見低吸納，午刻在一三五〇元左右掙扎，午收結果計甲乙回跌八十元，丙種尙平，丁極降六〇元，戊種五十元。</p>
<p>華股乍起乍落，恍惚不定，獲利者雖紛紛脫股換金，籌碼鬆動，跌風較前稍厲，一般雜色游齊，以年關之故，繼續加入股市活動，低後不乏買戶，證券帮中在最後時間仍來拉抬，午刻再被拉上，午收結果較前收計永紗好一百二十元，美亞五十元，信和三十元，景福五元，新光六元，　興三元，冷門各股則因散市較早。均稍回挫。</p>
<p>外股上塲仍由華股游資來活動，雜行餘資亦紛來點綴，頗見俏利，洋商多頭逢高源源脫手，迨華股轉跌，買戶始稍戒心，由高盤跌半成至一成左右，午刻都以低價妝市，結果較前收計怡緩跌一百元，會德豐降一千三，怡啤紙業各百元。</p>
<h3>絲市漲風已平　綢貨買興甚濃</h3>
<p>人造絲市價已漸見平靜，昨晨一二〇號天橋開一百萬元，最高一百〇二萬元收盤，最低做九十六七萬元，　單八十三萬元，最高八十八萬元，最低七十九萬元。傳聞將有巨　現貨拋售，市價有續趨疲　之　，　經零担，客帮用戶，頗有進瘸腿，僙　做高，綢貨交易頻繁，買　甚濃，天然絲織物，　上日漲起·成，美亞被面每百條，中華絲綢公司賣出價七十二萬元，大　格千璧縐每碼二千〇五十元，人造絲貨民生織錦缎及華錦縐，　站上日原盤，交易頗不寂。</p>
<h3>米價又帶緊</h3>
<p>米市以產區逐步高　，　緊一二百元，秈米白元均昂二三百元，麵粉南洋動而不旺，價形挺站，黃豆舟山福建納胃仍　，價再漲二三百元，豆餅汕頭帮暢　，續漲一二百元，生仁仍然稀少，芝蔴存到兩稀，價無榮辱，平價油雖在出售時期，惟油市以甬帮裝運來源見稀，猛漲二三千元。</p>
<h3>北貨市勢轉平　桂圓產價報高</h3>
<p>北貨因連日步升過甚，行方觀望，納胃漸呆，趨勢已轉平和，柱圓昨據泉州由溫州轉來電訊，產價比前反高，劃申亦需三萬元以上，而辦進後運申時日較久，利息亦必遽增，僅薄利而已。</p>
<h3>染織業重定新價　自本週開始實行</h3>
<p>染織美公會染色整理組各工廠，有兼營代客整染者，的三十家，近因調整出品，有劃一工價之舉，從十四日起，其價格略有增加，其原因聞係燃料缺乏，及德孚洋行配貨久久未發之故，茲探錄其新染價如左，（自甲級一九〇絲光士林起至淺色標準布止，均係十二磅四十碼之細布，自絲光白府綢起至手帕布止，則係三十碼之坏布，末後黃灰防雨布亦係四十碼細布，染價單位元）</p>

<h3>紡建標售下　紗市成交寥寥</h3>
<p>昨日紗市一蹶不振，緣上日午後紡建公司標售甚夥，人心因是大受打　，市價跌四五萬，買戶觀望不前，成交寥寥，市斱頓成供過於求之狀況。</p>
<h3>木材走銷尚佳</h3>
<p>近日本市木材實銷尙佳，因小木作多採辦裝修料，如柳安夾板等，南京方面建築將動，已有幾批來滬採辦，故市面脚地頗穩，至於大規模之建築，則有待於陰歷春間，外洋木材到埠，恐亦須至四月間也。</p>
<h3>茶葉銷路活動市價普遍上升</h3>
<p>自各路交通次第開展後，本市紅錄茶去化，亦逐漸恢復，邇來除天津，江北等帮絡繹運去外，他若漢口各地，亦有復興之勢，而本市茶葉存底，則甚爲薄弱，來源方面，目前僅恃陸運，尙有到貨，至於水路，因時屆冬令，河水較淺，難以順利搬裝，於是迎日市勢輒以求過於供爲憾，價格亦扶搖直上，昨日各項花色，每擔比前普遍軋升四千元至七八千元不等，且成交數量，並不减色云。</p>
<h3>馬口鐵貨缺價俏</h3>
<p>二十四號大馬口鐵，爲製造紗廠滾簡之必需品，自太平洋戰爭爆發後，市上存貨幾被徵一空，迨此次勝利後，小型紗廠漸次復工，頗有添辦，因此底貨益見淺薄，欲求整箱，憂憂乎難，惟零星交易尙能應付，現每張售七千五百元，其他馬口鐵行情，亦均挺秀，一入〇磅雙連馬口鐵每箱以七萬五千元做出，一一二磅火油箱坯子每箱竟喊高至三萬五千元，造成空前新紀錄。</p>
<h3>本市營業稅　由中央徵收　劃一部歸地方</h3>

<h3>白桐油緊俏</h3>
<p>白桐油自戰車後，最受委曲，自勝利以還，國際易逐漸恢復，外銷日趨　活潑，各物跌價之時，獨桐油能維持原狀，近各物又見漲勢，而桐油亦隨之緊俏，足度而能合外銷資格者，每市擔價格須三萬二千元，不足度而僅供內銷者，二萬八九千元，洪江油老牌真貨即將運到，故本地所產者，現售二萬二千元左右。</p>
<h3>英國撤消　對華貿易統制</h3>
<p>本年一月九日起</p>

<h3>敎部首次招等記者</h3>
<p>杭次長報告處理京臨大經過　記者提出嚴厲整頓學風意見</p>
<p>（本報南京專訊）敎育部於十四日下午三時·在會議室舉行首次記者招待會，到本報駐京記者房滄浪、張安愚、新聞報駐京記者曹天從、王慕良等三十餘人，</p>
<p>由杭立武次長主席，報吿處理首都臨時大學補習班少數學生滋事經過，及敎部爲復昌進行之工作計劃，大致如次：</p>
<p>復員工作　予〔杭次長自稱）爲復員工〕作，於上年十二月間來京，根據在渝善後敎育會議辦法，力謀實施，敎部尙在大後方、南京辦事處爲謀就近直接處理鄰近省市敎育行政事務便利起見，故對於京滬兩市及浙閩蘇皖贛五省之敎育行政，目前概由京方辦理。在一月六日以前，敎部爲改進收復區敎育種種設施，及學風之整頓，已在計劃之中。不料臨時大學補習班少數所謂一二一同學會之局部學生，忽然滋事，爲要求公開英文試卷及待遇等，發生不幸事件，並再加以申述此事之起因及敎部處理之經過。（詳情已見前報，茲不再贅）予木人在二十年前，在歐洲留學，曾任新聞大陸等報特約記者。</p>
<p>臨大事件　此次臨大事件，承各報一致主持正論，使一般靑年得有指導引入正軌，至深感謝。至臨大所請英文教授是任敎多年之第一流教授，所以甄試英文者，因敵僞時代學生英文鐘點太少，以致程度低落，雖說大學生，乃至有初中程度不及者，會試之後，對程度差者，多加補習，以期漸可合班，並無惡意。又學生福利事項，敎部已設法訂購鐵床，添置床舖，並爲淸寒及家在匪區之學生，分別救濟，被救濟學生，的佔三分之一，分甲乙兩種，甲種月可貸金三千元，乙種一千五百元，並向陸總部接洽煤斤，以期減輕學生伙食擔負，敎部決計澈底整頓學風，希望各報一致贊助。繼又報吿敎部最近已辦及擬辦各事。</p>
<p>視察各區　（一）派部督學彭百川赴各收復區視察敎育復員工作惰形，如校舍設備損失到如何程度，復員時目前必須之補充，在在均有關經費，因此調查有所要據，以謀實際之配合。（二）派部內高級職員並聘專家，聯合督導東南區各省市敎育復員工作，希望一年內完全復員就緒，愈速愈妙，務使各收復區學生皆有書可讀，此事積極凖備，即將先從京滬開始。</p>
<p>劃一校舍　（三）在計畫中者，即國民敎育。對全國各小學之校舍課堂，謀整齊劃一，于採光通氣，學生運動，生理衛生，均須顧及，並請工程師參加設計指導，以便將來建築十分適合之校舍。並分甲乙丙三種，視經費環境情形而定，但最低限度，要有丙種之校舍。小學生體育，允特別注重。（四）中小學敎科用書，敎部爲統一國定本，以謀戰後適當之整齊劃一敎本起見，已託正中。商務等書局，聯合公印，從速趕印國定本，及審定本中小學敎科用書，以便各校應用。（五）社會敎育之民衆敎育，對收復區人民，允須增加公民意識之訓練，擬利用廣播電台，及敎育電影，以普遍鄕村農民，使知八年抗戰之事實。</p>
<p>舉行甄審　（六）督促舉行中等學校敎職員之甄審，又專科以上敎職員之甄審，又大學畢業生之甄審，火致在僞組織下之大學畢業生，目前就業者，尙可試用。將來銓叙部銓叙時，如已經甄審合格者，由敎部出具證明書，云某生相當於大學文學士，法學士云云，而不能名爲某某大學畢業生。杭次長又報吿本人爲淸理戰時文物指失調查委員會生任委員，各地調查接收之文物，將來由中央通籌淸理，並派人到日本調查，編製目錢，將來由我政府向日要賠償云。杭次長報吿畢，趙太侔參事報吿：對臨大少數學生滋事，要求之目的，希望維持僞中大原學籍之意，行政方面，照在渝教育善後會議決議策畫，已遷就許多，寬大許多，於此事之原委，多所補充。</p>
<p>記者意見　繼由中央日報馬星野提出三點，並希望敎部之敎育行政措施，此後於必要時，繼續舉行類似今日之談話會，以便交換意見。繼由和平日報女記者蒲立德提出音樂，要特別注意改正，以免首都再時聽敵偽時荒亂頹慶不正之音。救國日報龔德柏表示贊同，幷發表敎部應嚴厲整頓學風之意見。敎部表示接受，賓主盡歡而散。（愚）</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕杭次長在招待記者會上答各記者詢問構：（一）各機關並未拒絕錄用偽大學畢業生，但此僅屬試用，銓叙時須憑敎部甄審後之證明文件，此項文件，只證明其相當學位，不指明乃由何校畢業。（二）敎部刻正淸查僞敎育部文卷，對甘心附逆之教育界人士，決依法懲處。（三）敎部已電請馮友蘭，顧毓琇等名敎授，赴各臨時大學補習班講學。</p>
<h3>援助私校經濟辦法　市長允與敎局商討</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕本市私立中小學代表，昨日（十五）下午二時，爲補助費及學費事，謁見敎育局顧局長。顧局長對私校自動實施經濟公開辦法，暨酌加家境較優學生學費，以擴充免費學額，救濟淸寒學生等，事前已有所聞，故會見時再三稱道，補助費允予籌劃，學費亦將擬定變通辦法。至於各校長定於十八日請訓事，局長亦已許可。各代表旋即趕赴市府，蒙錢市長立即召見，對私校情形，垂詢甚詳，頗同意于各校充實內容之意見，並謂運動設備，與健康敎育，更宜注意，對於各校校舍被佔事，據吿後，即手錄于日記簿中。至於援助私校經濟辦法，允與顧局長商討。</p>
<h3>敎部通令取締　僞敎科書</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶訊〕敎育部以收復區各書局，尙有偽敎科書發行，各學校亦有仍用僞敎科書者，殊屬不合，特通令各　局，嚴予取締。（鸚）</p>
<h3>中學生暫勿　參加政治活動</h3>
<p>敎局昨召校長討論</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕市敎育局以近日來各校學生，每多參加遊行等校外活動，足以影響學業，而對於法總領事妨書我國主權一案，允有形成國際上重大糾紛之虞，爰於昨日下午三時召集一部份公私立學校校長赴局談話，出席者計有晋元中學，樂羣中學，上海女中，民立女中等二十餘校校長，首由顧局長報吿召集談話要旨，略謂中學生學力未充，認識不足，希望各校勸導學生專心向學、暫勿參加政治性的活動云云。繼由各校校長分別報吿，最近學生校外活動情形，但間亦有校名雖刊報端，而學生並未參加者。旋經討論結果，定於本月十八日以全市公私立中等學校名義，分電政治協商會議及敎育部，籲請各黨各派勿令中等學校學生參加政治工作，俾能專心向學。常推定晋元中學校長金通尹草擬電稿，並望各校校長於十八日下午赴局簽名蓋章，以使如期拍發，而昭愼重。</p>

<p>抗戰勝利以後，敎育建設已居於首要地位，這是誰也不能否認的事．但上海一般私立學校，不論中學或小學，在此新舊蛻變經濟發生極度恐慌的時候，要想設法救濟，使向「敎育建設」的大道前進，我以爲應該積極推行下列三大運動：</p>
<p>（一）救校運動　本來私立學校的設立條件，第一須有校董，第二須有基金，可是上海情形特殊，大多數的私立學校，只有掛名校董，沒有固定基金，經費的籌措。大抵不出兩途，非抑低敎師待遇，即增加學生學費。値此生活指數繼續上升，如果增加學費則學生無力負担，勢不能不中途輟學；要是從抑低敎師待遇方面着想，則敎師無法維持生活，勢又不能不改業他就。學生跑，敎師跑，學校本身還能存在嗎！即使少數能出學費的學生儘可以點綴學校門面，但學校所能聘請的無非是低能的濫竿充數的敎師，也徒貽誤學生而已，學校的存在，更壞於不存在。爲維持這些私校正常的存在，應該普遍的推行一種「救校運動」。這種救校運動的主要目的，在於學校當局立時改組校董會，聘請社會熱心人士担任校董，由政府給予榮譽褒揚，使負責　募學校基金，穩定學校的永久基礎。</p>
<p>（二）禮師運動　敎師應受國家社會的特殊優遇，這是中外一揆的道理。然而現在上海私校敎師的待遇，差不多不及普通店員的薪給，甚至趕不上一個普通傭僕的工資，以栽培民族幼苗責任重大的尊嚴的中小學敎師，而僅得這樣菲薄的待遇，所謂「敎師至上」，不是等於一張張不兌現的空頭支票嗎？因此，我們應該積極推行一種一禮師運動」。這種禮師運動的主要目的，在使政府和人民通力合作，建設一種崇敬敎師的心理，除提高一般敎師的待遇外，並廣大的徽集敎師助金我，資助敎師，安定清苦的敎師生活。</p>
<p>（三）獎學運動　在一方面正在籌募學校基金，另一方面必須即時提高敎師待遇的雙重負擔的過渡期中，减輕學生的學費，極不是一件容易辦到的事。若因不能减輕學費而致學生中途輟學，是使一個新生國家而有國民入學者驟形减少的現象，豈非國家民族極大的恥辱，極大的損失，？我們在蔣主席「建國時期，敎育第一」的信條下，不但對於淸寒學生要推進貸學運動，即對一般學生，亦須積極推進一種「獎學運動」，使完成新生中國的新敎育建設。這種獎學運動的主要目的，在甄選學業成績優越的學生，分別給予獎金，以示鼓勵；更優越的，並給予家畏榮譽獎狀或獎章，使家長都能養成一種「栽培子弟高於一切」的神聖任務的心理，寗節省其他消費，而不能不盡力爲他子弟籌劃一筆數字可觀的學費。</p>
<p>爲上海市私校渡過當前的難關，爲新生中國增進敎育的基本建設的力量，希望這三大運動，能够得到政府當局和學校當局的同意推行，和廣大社會人士的熱心贊助，並希望在短期內能够產生顯著而普遍的效果。</p>

<h3>柏德遜氏招待記者　美對華政策不變　昨與魏德邁將軍商討戰區情況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）美陸軍部長柏德遜，昨日下午四時，在華懋飯店八樓，招待記者。到中外各報通訊社代表五十餘人，柏氏由其副官吉士柏上校作陪。</p>
<p>柏氏首先報吿，渠於前晨抵滬，昨晨與中國戰區美國總司令魏德邁將軍，商討中國戰區情况，及以後各問題。此外又參加美軍代表的二十人之集會，彼等即要求回國，會中提出要求數點，當時魏將軍亦曾在塲。柏氏又謂，渠離此後即去菲列賓視察，對於因預定行程已有躭誤，而不能赴重慶一行，表示遺憾。</p>
<p>兵士要求決予考慮　繼由柏氏答覆各記者所詢問題，關於美軍所提各點，柏氏決將予以考慮。美軍在華之任務問題，及彼等是否即可返國，均須愼重考慮，柏氏附言，艾森豪威爾將軍昨日向國會發表之演說，甚爲重要。</p>
<p>一貫政策並無變更　柏氏聲稱，渠與魏將軍所討論美軍在華任務及各問題，僅係細則，並不牽涉美國政策。美國政策乃山杜魯門總統所決定，一且決定，斷不致有所改變。美對華之政策有三點：（一）協助造成一民主團體之中國，（二　）消滅日本在華勢力，（三）協助中國運送日兵回國。</p>
<p>各方情形互有出入　柏氏不售美軍應作抗議等等集會，渠認爲彼等應以正當方法，向當局申訴及要求考慮。至於其他各地情形與此處略有不同，拍氏在日本時，並未見任何抗議情形。在朝　時則僅有五六人作此同樣請求。柏氏不擬再與此地士兵作共他談話。</p>
<p>有訊渠對於美軍在華佔領情形之意見，柏氏謂美軍在華佔領勢力，經昨晨魏將軍及第七艦隊司令柯克上將之報吿，認爲極小，與美軍在日本，朝鮮佔領力量比較，則相差甚遠。</p>
<p>對於馬帥並無意見　盟國管制日本委員會，現尚不知何時開會，但當柏氏離日本時，已有遠東委員會之代表抵日開始工作。至美與蘇聯在日之聯絡情形，昨日由雙方之聯絡委員會舉行會議。有詢柏氏對馬歇爾元帥在渝之批評，柏氏謂其本人與馬元帥雖係友好，並同事多年，但最近已久未通訊，所有通訊亦僅係個人事務，對其任務並無意見。</p>
<p>關於艾森豪威爾之工作問題，認爲艾將軍作參謀長爲時僅二月，其本人不以爲艾將軍有何理由　職。</p>
<p>陸部贊同設顧問團　美國對於在華設立軍事顧問國事，目前並我任何反響，市長，沈士華秘書長，市府各局長，英美軍政長官，警備司令部副司令李及闌，本市各界開人，及各覆記者等二百餘人，至七時許始盡興而散。</p>
<p>當宴會正興高彩烈之際，電燈突然熄滅，全塲乃陷於昏黑。只有煙頭火光，興夫暗中笑語而已。一分鐘後，燈火復亮，男女嘉賓俱各舉杯’重慶光明之來臨。</p>
<p>柏魏二氏參觀梅劇　此次中華海員華海員工會，國民外交協會美陸軍部對此舉頗爲贊同。</p>
<p>柏德遜部長定今日或明日卽離滬赴菲，然後再赴世界各處視察，但其行程期間尙不能定。柏氏在日本曾勾留一週之久。</p>
<p>魏氏舉行鷄尾酒會　魏德邁將軍特於昨日下午五時一刻，假法國總會舉行雞尾酒會，以歡迎柏氏。到本市錢，及中華婦女互助會四法團，爲籌募救濟殉難海負家屬基金，敦請梅蘭芳博士，各票高華先生，舉行義演。昨晚美陸軍部長柏德遜及魏德邁將軍，均前往皇后大戲院欣賞，對於梅博士高華先生及各演員精彩演山，極表贊許。</p>
<h3>促法總領事反省　學生遊行出於愛國　呂懷君昨對記者談</h3>
<p>自法國駐滬總領事費禮浩在滬秘密擅捕納粹罪犯法人卡可平諾，交由法艦白爾丁號偷押離滬一案發生以來，本埠各界咸表憤慨，紛紛電請政府依法採取有效行動以保國權。前日下午復有本塢學生一萬五千作對法示威遊行。記者昨特往訪外交部駐滬辦事處秘書呂懷君，就此案之最近發展情形，有所詢問。承呂氏答覆各點如下：</p>
<p>李氏首謂關於此案，現已在外交部經由法國駐華大使向法政府交涉中。在未奉外部命令前，本處暫不擬更有行動。關於傳聞法駐滬總領事尚秘密擅捕若干人犯一節，本處尙無所聞，惟念中法邦交素篤，相信法駐滬總領事今後不致再有損害我國法權及妨害中法邦交之舉動發生。</p>
<p>記者詢以貴處對本埠學生對法領館示威遊行之感想如何，據答，我國現爲一人民有集會結社自由之民主國家，凡在法律軌道內之人民集會，自有其活動之自由。昨日本埠學生集會遊行事，聞秩序甚好，此種事本人近年在國外時，亦嘗見之。</p>
<p>至傳聞昨日示威遊行之學生在法總領館時，曾將法國國旗由旗杆卸下，此事本人毫無所聞，並相信所傳不確，因隨此次參與遊行之學生，均係迫於愛國熱忱，目的在促使與我友誼素篤之法國反省，遊行時秩序甚好，且聞嗣有我方軍警在塲護衛該領館，以防範學生個人有軌外行動，故本人不信有上項傳說之事，另又聞本埠學生總會已表示並未有上述行爲，縱令有此事，亦應另案辦理，不能與法領破壞我法權案混雜。</p>
<p>最後記者復詢何時開辦護照簽證，據答此事已在向外部請示中，其辦法不久可公布。</p>

<p>提出要求計有五項　記者特走訪該公司職工會，據悉：此次怠工，乃因昨日公司覆函對職工之書面要求不願考慮而引起，其要求的可分五項：（一）去年十二月份之工資，不能小於十一月份，（二）公司曾經答應調整票價後，將考慮年賞金問題，遲遲不見實行，（三）州底薪之調整，（四）幕助工會之設立，（五）取消包工制，以保障老工友等，勞方代表曾語本報記者，我們的怠工，並不影響治安，對市民的交通，亦仍顧到，寫字間職員亦照常辦公，水電供應一如常態，若不能得到合理解決後，我們次繼續下去，」截至發稿時止，仍在怠工狀熊中。</p>

<h3>從冷酷的世界中獲了重生</h3>
<p>— 本報記者至素人</p>
<p>爲什慶大家都注意慧珠？國爲她年輕，她美麗，她多情，她曾經自殺。然而這些都已經是過去的事了。如今的言懸珠是「柳葉雙屆久不描，「她皈依了天主敎，並說惟有神恩才能拯救她，使她　忽的心有所歸宿。忘去了過去種種，做一個新人，盡瘁於戲劇，走上真眞的人生大道。</p>
<p>追隨梅氏悉心習藝　對於關心她的朋友，她表示衷心的感謝；對於濫施攻撃的人，她希望以後將有事實給他們以證明。刀說這次來上海最大的原因，是預備長期追隨梅蘭芳先生，接受梅派藝術的衣　。因爲梅先生已過了五十歲，不會再有很多的機會給她觀摩了，所以勉要每天會見梅先生，隨時請益，看他每一塲</p>
<p>社會無情促其厭世　記者會見言女士，承她告訴我這些話。接着，她又以極坦白的態度，叙述自殺的原因與經過，正和勉的遺書一樣，她爲使她厭世的最大原因，是感到人世的冷酷，社會的無情。外傳種種，固屬事出有因，但她以爲一種正常的交際，何必大驚小怪。女伶也是一個平常人，有血肉，有情感，她和別人一樣的要朋友，要愛情的慰藉。她相信自己有這個權利，也承認自己在考慮結婚，她說婚姻和事業並無衝突。</p>
<p>護士白帽頓靈感　去年十一月八日深夜三時，在故都，一個女人悄悄地吞下大量的安眠藥，沒有眼淚，沒有痛苦，她要求一個解脫，像每一個聰明人所要求的一樣。直到二十七小時以後，她重新有了知覺，聽見熟悉的語聲，看見淸早的晨光。但是她並沒有放棄離開塵世的念頭，沉重無力的四肢，不可能結東自己的生命。她想絕食，但醫生吿訴她：注射也能够延長生命。正在莫名徬徨的時候，德國醫院女護士的白帽子，給了她光明和生活的勇氣，她想想別人都在忙碌地工作，爲信仰，爲人羣而服務，她爲什麼不可以這樣做？她也可以積極起來。就憑這點靈感，一個將墮地獄的女人，就飯依了主，十分祈誠地受了洗禮，早晚都做彌撒。就這樣漸漸地把一個動燙的心安靜下來，她是得救了，她獲得了重生。</p>
<p>改革平劇努力前進　現在，宗敎和藝術是她的兩根支柱。前者只要祈誠和持久，後者還須靠自已的進取。她表示平劇的舞合面要改革大紅大錄的觀色，和檢塲人隨便行動，都足以分散觀衆的注意力。至於原有的精華，如唱腔，身段，及一切象徵的手法，都要保存下來，使平劇能表現出充份的東方色彩。她說梅先生差不多已把這幾點完成了，她自己最近在北京表演「西施復國記」，也盡力在向這方面改進。</p>
<p>蔣夫人函語重心長　去年底蔣主席蒞平，她曾經上書自辯，因爲商業報曾登載她與敵僞往來。後來該報被改組了。她還給蔣夫人寫了一封長信，提到婦女問題，半月以後，回信來了，表示對地同情，並勉勵她勇敢地活下去。</p>
<p>矛盾心理造成不幸　在D．D．S．咖啡館　靜的一角裏，二小時的長談，我已能體會到一個久歷風塵的女人有着極度矛盾的心理，在過去，有時她想往上，但是不知不覺中，又做了一個網，硬把自己再拖進去。所謂：「　　反被聰明　」，言憑珠就是這樣一　個不幸的女人。</p>

<h3>陵園看花行</h3>
<p>— 湯立言</p>
<p>陵園爲都人士女遊息之所，陷敵後花木樓台摧毀殆盡，詩人湯立言於三年前赴京憑弔，有「陵園看花行」一篇，亦杜老「哀江頭」之意，今敵氛肅淸，河山再造，使於彬花開時，重臨舊地，其感想爲何如也！</p>
<p>編者誌</p>
<p>江南三月春如海，繁花朵朶隨風擺，三年重作秣陵遊，風景不殊出河改。憶昔陵園花正好，柳下靑聰加春草，一笑相逢陌上車，墜鞭遺翠誰家少？誰家年少足風流，帝子無愁女莫愁，夜夜後庭歌玉樹，朝朝寒食作春遊。吳姬越女顏如王，曲綫生春嬌結束，行到花中不見人，人而如花看不足。中有幾個椒房親，明璫翠羽更絕倫，蠻鞋羅襪千金貴，五色繽紛滃若雲。一朝胡騎滿天下，九重城　生烟塵，傾國只緣三婦艷，花開剩有六朝春。萬事如斯隨轉燭，紛紛棋局又翻復，太白長歌蜀道難，杜陵野老呑聲哭！化鶴歸來止國門，茂陵風雨欲黃昏，樂遊原上春將老，梅花落盡櫻花繁。嗚呼！櫻花中雖繁謝亦連，會看明朝風雨惡。</p>
<h3>使她眩暈的勝利</h3>
<p>— 莽弟</p>
<p>許多許多的自省，或者意見，埋怨，以至於督促，不斷在修飾，拘束她那新的風度－勝利。</p>
<p>似乎她剛放下那擠牛乳的木桶－那下等的傢伙，被招待進一間上等階級的堂皇大廳。她覺得披着這樣華麗的禮服，掛着這般鮮美的紅花，又站在尊貴的他們底中間，興奮呀、也許她簡直不能自已，於是，她又覺得有人在注視自己。</p>
<p>嫉忌嗎？卑視嗎？但那總不是善意贊揚的目光！於是她檢點自己，拘東自己，開始覺得她的脚步太沉重；不，是鞋子太窄；皮膚太粗；牙齒太黑；或竟是因自己的身子太低……她低聲地像對她魯莽的弟弟在親戚家時般的說：小心呀！謹愼呀！不要那般不上塲面的丟了臉兒！</p>
<p>可是她覺得不自由了！她眞不能學他們的步法－那般大方，安閒，或是因爲無從換去這雙太窄的鞋子吧？她又偸偸地將臉部手背努力按摩，可是痛了，卻去不了這些粗礫的皮膚！不能呀！慚愧呀！一切的一切……！她開始憤怒地，沮喪地埋怨自己，咀咒自己，但他似乎無意脫下，藏起了那光榮的收獲－禮服，紅花，地位，而提起擠牛乳的木桶－那下等故舊的伴侶，去爲她的成功和未來努力。她更不信任在這下等的，故舊的中間，是還可找到新的實在的成功。她又不瞭　與尊貴的他們問的距離利關係，而執迷，眩暈在這新的風度裏。她以爲這樣時髦的裝飾，就只能空虛的躑躅在尊貴的她們中間，也總勝過從那種下等，勞苦，故舊上的努力。</p>
<p>她眞不贊同：當自已沒有尊貴的他們般眞實的成功以前，是不需要空虛的拘束，修飾和咀咒，還是踏住自己的本位，繼續那無論故舊而爲自己所能盡的努力。她眞執迷，眩暈在新的風度裏－勝利！</p>
<h3>冬夜</h3>
<p>— 茜草</p>
<p>今夜，我聽到了原野的喚召，我的心開始了不安寗。雖然，我們都有一顆熱然的心，充滿着愛的火熖，可是，誰能了解誰的心？</p>
<p>人與人之間是需要坦白的。可是當一個赤裸裸的陌生人站在妳的面前，脫下了他的面具，妳一定會覺得猙獰，甚至說他不近人情。</p>
<p>共實我也知道坦白是可貴的</p>
<p>那末，讓我坦白吿訴妳吧：我想把今夜的月亮和明日的太陽用一根長長的繩子縛在一起。</p>
<p>然而，今夜的月亮？明日的太陽？這簡直在做夢。</p>
<p>今夜，連月的影子也被幽禁了，還有什麼話說。</p>
<p>寒霧凝霜的夜里，天色很沉滯，在　着的街上我感到無限的凄凉。噯，我爲什麼不回去呢？在街頭躑躅幹嗎？</p>
<p>冬夜的風霜會凝凍了我的心</p>
<p>冬天的夜空，是不會有藍色的抒情。</p>
<p>我從街頭躑躅歸來，帶回了無限冷意，使我發抖，使我凄凉</p>
<p>今夜，枕上濕透了，呵，我眞的流淚嗎？</p>
<p>我從來就不輕易流過淚，正如不愛惜自已的情感，我常把情感無條件無代値的任意犧牲，所換取的僅是一些漂渺的詩情。</p>
<p>可是，今夜我爲了無法抑制自巴的情感的衝動而流淚了。</p>
<p>我不敢放聲號咷，祇把腦袋鑽在被窩里幽咽　泣，我不願任何一個人發現我在流淚。</p>
<p>何必呢？我已經心碎了。何必把自已的傷心去騙別人的眼淚？每一滴眼淚都有它的代值的。</p>
<h3>我空着兩手回來</h3>
<p>— 蕭夢</p>
<p>我空着兩手回來，穿的還是那件離家時的破大褂；一陣風起，吹得像花蝴蝶似的飛舞。再望了望腿上的疤痕，那個在×山一仗的痕跡。帶着嘲笑的口吻，也對我望個正着。我感到無底的辛酸……千百只的嘴臉，熟　了的嘴臉。在跟着挖苦我，嘲笑我。使我抬不起頭來。</p>
<p>「傻子。嚇！一股子　勁，當官不發財麼」？記得那個尖腦兒的特務長在背後給我題的渾號——優子。</p>
<p>是的，我是便子，一個不肯隨波逐流多刺多角的一塊溪水中的小石。但是這些不足這的冷刺熱諷，我却處之泰然。相反的在跟部下臨別時自己的幾句心底話，却使我乾澀的眼眶裏掉下了淚水，這是我有生以來，可說是第一次眞正的傷感吧？從心坎裏淌出的眼淚呵！</p>
<p>「同志們：張開我們微弱的限睛看吧！祖國健全了嗎？會營鑽，會舞弊的所謂名流紅人，欺瞞了世人。却以大英雄大豪傑高居寳座了。中國，中國……」我爲自己沉痛顫抖的語調而流淚了。弟兄們也被感動得哭了，默默地淚聲心聲在交織着。</p>
<p>這是我提長假單請示照准後，臨別時跟弟兄們的訓話。我淌着熱淚，潤濕了衣襟。去，去吧！可恥而又卑鄙的淚，打回這辛酸的淚，如今我再也不哭——我是叛徒。</p>
<p>如今我空着兩手回來，穿的還是離家時的破大掛；一陣風起……</p>
<p>筆底春秋</p>
<h3>「官」與「民」</h3>
<p>— 謝東平</p>
<p>中國數千年來傳說的官僚政治，把官與民鮮明的劃成了兩個界綫，官是一個階級，所謂士大夫階級，官永遠可以做官，世世代代可以做富，官不光是管民，而且永遠是在民之上。我頂討默那個「書香門第」的好聽名詞兒，實在所謂「書香門第」就是講客套，講虛僞，浮禮耨節官派氣味十足的大家族而巴。</p>
<p>官僚制度不打破，什麼民主也是空的，所謂「還政於民」，這一還，就還到了做官的人手裏去。因之，還不還就無所謂。</p>
<p>中國的社會，一向官領導着民生活着，官一方面好像是做着榜樣，一方面又享有着時殊的權益，俗語說，「只許州官放火，不許百姓點燈」，這放火就長做官的特殊權益，你不能點燈，因爲你不是官而是百姓啊。</p>
<p>現在時代不同了，這情形就該反一反了，所謂反一反，不是「只許百姓放火，不許州官點燈」，而是要由官的領導民，而變爲民領導官，民請官做事，官却一定要聰民的話。</p>
<p>在中國的社會裏，說來氣人，老百姓就是沒資格講話，你如講了什麼話，那些官派人物，就會問你：「你憑什麼資格請這些話？」，其實他的資格最高，他是老百姓，他可以管官，他有對官說任何話的權利。</p>
<p>假如一旦民眞是領導官了，官再沒有什麼特殊的權益可享，那末，那些熱中於做官的人，就不再想做官了，官就讓熱中於做事的人去做，老百姓地位一提高，大家都願意做老百姓，天下包你太平，那就是呱呱呌的民主，</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（五）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨太太比墨老爺小兩歲，有相當的姿色，喜歡修飾，出身也是貴族的原故，也很講究享受。或許這就是她的缺點吧，爲了太不能吃苦，生活無法節儉，手裏也就沒有什麼積蓄。</p>
<p>墨太太在北京認識的一位翁二太太，如今又在荆州碰到了。翁二太太和墨太太的情形差不多，翁老爺在北京又娶了一位翁二太太，於是便把翁二太太送到荆州來。翁二太太恰和墨太太相反，她的性格弱得像象皮，你把她揉搓成什麼樣兒，就是個什麼樣兒。但是他生得比墨太太標緻，還會哼幾段皮黃，據說翁老爺當時就爲她這兩個長處才討了她。可是後來她老了，翁老爺眼裏便失了寵。墨太太同情她的遭遇，因此她們作了很好的朋友。翁二太太有許多事都仰仗墨太太替她做主。雖然有人勸過墨太太，說翁二太太的出身有點兒不正經，最好別太接近她，但是墨太太不聽，墨太太以爲越是正經的人，才越幹出不正經的勾當。所以墨太太固執地同情翁二太太，帮助翁二太太。她們語直地成天形影不離，後來索興翁二太太就住到墨太太的家裏。整整有四年工夫，直至翁老爺和墨老爺從北京回來，她們才分開。</p>
<p>墨老爺和墨太太分居南北兩地，各自盡量地尋樂享受，彼此不置生產，於是等到一旦跨下來的時候，皆大窮窘！</p>
<p>滿淸的末日終于到了！革會黨掃蕩了北京的皇室，建立民國。所有旗族的富吏，都一律變成了庶民。墨老爺就在這時候。偕同翁老爺還有隨侍他十幾年的老聽差墨盛，一起狼狽地奔赴荆州，投降到太太們的裙下。</p>
<p>這麼一來，墨太太更加神氣活現了，勉想盡了法子折磨墨老爺，她要報復他，過去墨老爺對不起她的地方。她不但自己這樣，而且敎翁二太太也這樣。這兩位老爺便作了兩位太太的俘擄，于是這兩位俘擄同病相憐，也成爲了好朋友。</p>
<p>頭半年，還過得去；這後牛年，就只靠着墨太太買的那幾十畝田地所收的三二十石稻子，維持這一家生活。不要說早點吃不到燕窩銀耳，就是西餐飯，也逐漸地素食起來。墨太太饞了，她就自己約了翁二太太到小館子裏去滋補滋補。或則是買點魚呀肉的，兩個人躱在屋裏偸偸享受一番。旣沒有兩位老爺的份兒，兩位老爺也絕不敢表示一點意見。</p>
<p>墨太太並且派了墨老爺一個差事兒，就是敎授她們的寳鈴兒子念書。這樣在墨太太省了一筆請先生的費用，在墨老爺，總算沒有白呌她養活。其實，墨老爺自己又何嘗願意道樣在家裘坐吃山空呢？但是沒有他工作的機會，他不可能再做官，更不可能再過從前的日子。</p>
<p>寳鈴這時候已經九歲了，他很聽明，有些看出了他父母之間的隔閡，所以常常用些天眞的舉動，想調劑他們的空氣，挪撤他們的感情。但是沒有用，墨太太無動於中地毫不原諒墨老爺，並且不讓寳鈴呌他爸爸，吿訴實鈴說翁二太太就是他的「爸爸」。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>小職員行路艱　要求免費乘坐電車　原因在於回價太鉅</h3>
<p>編者先生：素仰你是人民的喉舌，專替社會服務，大衆得到你的帮助不少，我有一點意見，請你代爲呼籲，原因是現在市面上行使的鈔票，是那麼多，僞幣成大堆，法幣仍大疊，用起來眞如揮金如土，使得窮措大沒有鈿用而望之有點限紅，就以薪水階級的小職員而論，每月領到很少的薪給，算算先要付房租，又要買米，又要買柴，買菜，三四人口的小家庭，開門七件事已感　左支右絀，做衣服和娛樂費用，則根本談不到的，至於交際酬應，固然不能打在算盤珠上，然而也常需要。更大的問題，是必須先在這很徵的　水內，提出一部份，作爲電車費，以供每天從家裏到辦公室之用，以前車價小，每天往返的車資，已付得心痛了。要曉得這班人，不在科秘之列，不會有汽車迎送的，又必須遵照規定時間，趕到辦公室簽到，所以非乘電車不可，現在電車加似，官方乃爲體恤商艱，避免工潮起見，而准許他們加價，就忽略了沒有車資的小職員，若全憑兩條腿跑，如何趕得上辦公時間呢？我看到有位作者在某報談到「希望優待學生乘車」，不錯，學生中是有很多貧苦的，應當免費乘車，但是各機關的小職員，也須受到免費乘車的優待，官方對於此舉，自當予以同情，出一紙公文，商方是不會不接受的，然商方對此一點點的收入，値得什麼呢！一旦能够實現，一班小職員人人稱便，個個受惠，不禁要時時刻刻的歌功頌德了，敬祝撰安，讀者周君謹啓。</p>

<h3>Today's Agenda to Discuss Military Affairs; List of Group Committee Members Announced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The list of members for the Political Consultative Conference's group committees, as designated by Chairman Chiang, is as follows: Government Organization Group: Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, Wang Ruofei, Lu Dingyi, Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Wang Yunwu, Fu Sinian. Conveners: Wang Shijie, Luo Longji. Government Program Group: Chen Bulei, Zhang Laisheng, Dong Biwu, Wang Ruofei, Chang Naihui, Yang Yongjun, Zhang Shenfu, Huang Yanpei, Li Zhuchen, Guo Moruo, Fu Sinian. Conveners: Zhang Laisheng, Dong Biwu. Military Affairs Group: Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Zhou Enlai, Lu Dingyi, Chen Qitian, Yang Yongjun, Zhang Dongsun, Liang Shuming, Miao Jiaming, Hu Lin. Conveners: Hu Lin, Zhang Dongsun. National Assembly Group: Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Laisheng, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, Zhang Bojun, Liang Shuming, Shao Congen, Qian Yongming. Conveners: Zeng Qi, Deng Yingchao. Constitution Draft Group: Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wu Yuzhang, Zhou Enlai, Chen Qitian, Chang Naide, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Fu Sinian, Guo Moruo. Conveners: Fu Sinian, Chen Qitian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The Government Organization Group, the first group committee of the Political Consultative Conference, held its first meeting at 3:00 PM today to discuss the opinions raised by various members. It is scheduled to hold a second meeting tomorrow to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The agenda for the sixth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on the 16th will be to discuss military issues, and Vice Minister Lin of the Ministry of Military Affairs will be invited to report on the military reorganization situation. The proposals include: a proposal by member Zeng Qi and four others on "Ceasing Military Conflicts and Implementing Nationalization of the Armed Forces," and a proposal by member Zhang Laisheng and eight others on "Implementing Nationalization of the Armed Forces and Conducting Large-Scale Troop Reductions."</p>
<p>(United Press, Chongqing, 15th) The Political Consultative Conference has today accepted the draft government reorganization plan, which will still grant the Kuomintang the leading position and entrust Chairman Chiang as the chairman. His powers, under the system of checks and balances, will be somewhere between those of the American President and the British King. This plan has only been accepted in principle; the technical details will be agreed upon later. The Kuomintang will still retain the power to appoint the transitional government, but all parties and factions will have the power to decide policies in the reorganized National Government Committee. The National Government Committee will replace the Supreme National Defense Council and become the highest legislative body of the country, supervising all ministers within the government in terms of budget allocation. The ministers will not be responsible to the National Government Committee except for the budget constraints. The Political Consultative Conference debated heavily this morning on expanding the government to accommodate various parties and the distribution of seats on the National Government Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 15th] The Political Consultative Conference has formally received Chairman Chiang's plan to accommodate various parties and expand the government. However, no decision has yet been made on the Chinese Communist Party's request to release Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 15th stated: The Chongqing Political Consultative Conference held its fifth meeting this afternoon. The Chinese Communist Party representatives presented eleven proposals to guarantee the freedom of the people and explained them in detail one by one, which took a considerable amount of time.</p>
<h3>No Proposals for Government Program; Members Only Exchange Broad Opinions; To Be Summarized and Discussed by Committee Before Being Presented to the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The Political Consultative Conference held its fifth meeting at 9:00 AM today (the 15th) to discuss the issue of the government program. Representatives from various parties and non-party representatives did not submit any formal proposals but only exchanged opinions broadly. Speakers today included Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Shenfu, Wu Tiecheng, Dong Biwu, Zhang Bojun, Chang Naide, Luo Longji, Chen Bulei, Li Zhuchen, and Shao Congen. It was decided that the group committee would summarize opinions from all sides and then present them to the assembly for discussion. Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that 32 members were present, and members Wang Shijie and Deng Yingchao were excused. Interim Chairman Sun Ke immediately announced the continuation of the discussion on the unfinished issue of government organization and the agenda item for today, the government program, inviting members to express their opinions. Liang Shuming spoke first, reiterating the issue of local government power, to be placed in the (Government Reorganization Plan). At that time, the agenda discussion shifted to the government program issue. Huang Yanpei hoped that the government would first propose a draft government program based on the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction to facilitate discussion. Zhang Shenfu said that the Democratic League's draft had not yet been prepared and that the main task of the Political Consultative Conference was to produce a common program. As for the content and form of the program: (1) there should not be too many clauses, (2) it should not be entirely principled but somewhat concrete. The content should include politics, economics, military affairs, diplomacy, education, academics, culture, society, relief, and post-war rehabilitation. Regarding the creation of the program, Zhang believed that it could be proposed by the government or produced through negotiation.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng spoke, saying that it was very difficult to discuss the government program today because no party had submitted a plan. He wanted to present opinions on the methods and principles of the government program: (1) Without dividing into categories, during this transitional period, anything that should be implemented and can be implemented can be listed as inclusive clauses. (2) Following the format of the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction, it should be divided into departments such as politics, military affairs, diplomacy, education, and economics, with each department defining several principles. (3) He participated in a symposium yesterday, and some people outside the meeting said that the Political Consultative Conference was not convened according to law and that its members were not elected, so its nature was no different from a party meeting, even criticizing them as a "distribution conference." Since the majority of those participating in the Political Consultative Conference are party members, it would be better to directly change the common program to a (Political Agreement), such as the kind of agreement made by various political parties in the wartime coalition cabinet in Britain. This was the opinion of people outside the meeting, which he reported for reference. As for the content of the program, it should abide by the National Father's Outline of National Reconstruction, and the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction, the political program and policies passed by the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang, and the 35th-year administrative policy passed by the National Political Council can all be used as a basis for discussion. Since no party has submitted a proposal, it is best to have a broad exchange of views first and then submit it to a subcommittee for study and discussion before presenting it to the assembly.</p>
<p>Dong Biwu presented the Chinese Communist Party's main points for the government program: (1) the basic policy of peaceful national reconstruction, (2) the people's freedom and rights, (3) expanding the foundation of the National Government, (4) preparing for the convening of a National Assembly, (5) local autonomy, (6) military reform, (7) post-war rehabilitation, (8) reform of finance and economy, (9) reform of culture and education, (10) international peace and security. Dong also explained each of these points in detail.</p>
<p>The meeting then recessed for five minutes before continuing to discuss the name of the program. Zhang Bojun, Chang Naide, and Huang Yanpei advocated calling it the Peaceful National Reconstruction Program. Zhang also explained that the purpose of formulating the program was to solve current problems and lay the foundation for future constitutional governance, to accomplish the mission of inheriting the past and paving the way for the future. Chang Naide, representing the Youth Party, presented his opinions on the government program, the principles of which were (1) brevity is better than extravagance, (2) reality is more important than theory, (3) removing evils is more important than promoting benefits. The key points of the content should focus on (1) national unity and stability, (2) China's responsibility to the world, (3) the coordination and application of the entire system, (4) the basic guarantee of democracy and freedom, (5) the economic capacity and support of the people, (6) the full development of education and culture. As for the drafting and discussion methods of the program, the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction should be used as a blueprint, and five people should be appointed to draft it and present it to the assembly. The content should separately define the protection of people's rights, the reform of central politics, the issue of local autonomy, post-war relief, the reorganization of finance and banking, and the support of production industries. Chang also said that the preamble to the program should state the significance of the nation first, the nation first, implementing democratic politics, maintaining world peace, paving the way for constitutional governance, and solving the current urgent problems. Luo Longji said that the creation of the government program is based on the needs of the people. Luo also commented on the programs proposed by the Chinese Communist Party and the Youth Party. Chen Bulei emphasized that a calm and harmonious spirit should be maintained during the meeting, and unnecessary terms commonly used outside the meeting, such as "coalition government," should not be used, and it is best to avoid them altogether. Because the so-called (coalition government) only exists in democratic countries in times of war, it is not applicable to the current organization of China. Regarding the name of the Peaceful National Reconstruction Program, now that military conflicts have ceased, the word "peaceful" has lost its object, so it can be simply called the National Reconstruction Program. Furthermore, regarding the drafting of the program by a subcommittee and the presentation of the draft to the assembly, more time should be given, because the opinions put forward by various parties involve the issue of local government organization, which is more complicated and should be fully negotiated so as not to hinder national unity. As for the military aspect, it should be decided whether and how to include it in the program after the military subcommittee has reached a resolution. Finally, he hoped that all parties would submit a written version of their oral statements to the secretariat so that the subcommittee would have a basis for negotiation. Zhang Shenfu said that this meeting should not only produce a program and ensure its implementation, but it must also be supervised by the people. Li Zhuchen elaborated in detail on solving the difficulties of farmers, developing water conservancy, revitalizing agriculture, strengthening industrial production, and promoting industrial construction. Fu Sinian wanted to speak, but because it was past noon, he stated that he would leave it for the next meeting. Huang Yanpei mentioned again the content of the program, believing that attention should be paid to local politics, labor-capital disputes, and the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. He also said that this meeting is to jointly plan national affairs, and words such as "distribution" used by outside critics should not be brought up in the meeting in the future. The chairman announced that the opinions of the members would be studied and negotiated by the group after being recorded, and then submitted to the assembly for discussion. Secretary-General Lei read out the list of members of the group committee and scheduled the sixth meeting for 9:00 AM tomorrow, and the meeting adjourned at one o'clock.</p>

<h3>Harmonious Atmosphere at the Fifth Meeting; Discussions Focus on Guaranteeing Freedom</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] At the fifth meeting, the government program was discussed, and no party put forward a concrete plan. The chairman asked the members to put forward their opinions, and all sides unanimously agreed that creating a program was necessary. Regarding the name of the program, Zhang Shenfu first proposed "Common Governance." Dong Biwu explained that the Chinese Communist Party had already drafted a Peaceful National Reconstruction Program. Chen Bulei said that since the War of Resistance had ended, the word "peaceful" had no object and advocated using the National Reconstruction Program. Regarding the nature of the program, it was recognized that it should be a common code for the transitional period before the implementation of constitutional government. Zhang Shenfu believes that it was not elected by the people and doubted whether the agreed program was legal. Wu Tiecheng explained that the outside opinion believed that it was a political consultation of various parties. Luo Longji greatly supported the Magna Carta of England, proving that even an agreement of various parties could be legal. The members spoke a lot on the principles and content. Chang Naide's three principles of brevity, reality, and the elimination of abuses were highly praised. The content put forward by various parties was very broad, including politics, finance, economy, military affairs, diplomacy, post-war relief, culture, and education, all of which focused on guaranteeing the freedom of the people. As for the program proposal, Huang Yanpei repeatedly advocated that the government should put it forward first. Wu Tiecheng proposed that the Outline of National Reconstruction, the Political Program of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the National Administrative Policy of the National Political Council for the 35th year, and the Outline for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction could be used as the basis for the drafting of the proposal. Zhang Bojun proposed that the laws of the National Government and the political programs of various parties should be added as reference points. Zhang Shenfu proposed that the program should have a preface. Chang Naide advocated that the preamble should include (1) the nation first, the nation first, (2) the politics of the whole people, (3) guaranteeing world peace, (4) preparing for the implementation of constitutional government, (5) urgent measures at the moment, and other meanings. As for the military method, it is still to be negotiated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] (1) There were frequent grand speeches at the meeting, and the atmosphere was very harmonious and lively. (2) Zhang Shenfu spoke, declaring that the Democratic League was not a political party, and hoped that the members of the League would speak, and if they were right, they would belong to the League, and if they were wrong, they would be responsible for themselves. (3) When Dong Biwu reported on the content proposed by the Communist Party, he said that the freedom of the people should include the right to strike and demonstrate. A male reporter from a major newspaper asked a female reporter from a small newspaper if there was freedom to strike. (4) Industrialist Li Zhuchen cried out that if labor disputes in factories are not resolved, please withdraw the party's activities from the factories. (5) Li Zhuchen proposed, the national farmers and workers, talked eloquently, hoping that the government would use great efforts, do great things, and seek great benefits, and not compete with the people for small profits. (6) When all parties talked about improving the lives of farmers, they all mentioned the 25% rent reduction, but Luo Longji, who was eloquent and good at words, mistakenly said that it was a 25% rent increase. (7) The chairman announced a 15-minute break, and many members went out to use the toilet. Wang Yunwu said, we are here waiting for the public bus. (8) When Luo Longji heard someone quoting outside criticism, there were many dirty words in it, and he asked everyone not to use harsh words such as distribution of spoils. Chen Bulei said, the word harsh is also harsh. (9) When Dong Biwu proposed the political program today, he admitted that he was an amateur in industrial construction. (10) The chairman asked Fu Sinian to speak, and he saw that the clock was 12:30, because he was humble that the day was long, and he would not speak today. However, because he was going to participate in the subcommittee, he wanted to speak again. Zhang Laisheng picked up his briefcase and shouted, is there not enough time? Why bother! (11) Zhou Enlai did not speak today, only when Cao Biwu reported, he left his seat to spit phlegm once.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Acts Quickly; Sends a Three-Person Team to Jehol; To Convey the Order to Stop the Conflict in the Chifeng Area</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The Military Mediation Executive Department recently issued its first communiqué stating that the newly established Military Mediation Executive Department took swift action today to stop the conflict in the Chifeng area of ​​Jehol Province. This morning, a three-person peace team was dispatched to the area with a ceasefire order. The three committee members arrived here in just over a day and a half. The order to stop the conflict was issued in Chongqing just six days ago, and the Executive Department has already begun to act, fulfilling its mission to stop the conflict between the National Government and the Communist Party. The troops on both sides in the Chifeng area may not have received the ceasefire order due to broken communications. This morning, a U.S. Marine Corps fighter jet dropped leaflets in the area, urging both sides to stop the conflict, and the leaflets requested the Communist-led forces in Chifeng to prepare the local airport for the landing of the peace team's C-47 aircraft. The members of the team are Major Gu Hanli, representing the National Government, ××× representing the Communist Party, and Colonel Dutille, representing the U.S. military. The team carries the ceasefire order issued by Wang Bingnan in Chongqing. They will first fly to Jinzhou to obtain direct orders from General Du Zhangming's headquarters, as the National Government troops in Jehol are under the command of General Du. They also carry letters signed by the three committee members requesting protection and assistance. After presenting their instructions, the team will investigate the situation in the conflict area and report to the Executive Department headquarters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 14th] Thirteen representatives of the Chinese Communist Party to the Military Mediation Executive Department, led by Li Kenong, Director of the Chinese Communist Party's Office in Chongqing, flew to Beiping this morning on a C47 U.S. transport plane to assist Ye Jianying in implementing the order to stop military conflicts and restore transportation. Li Kenong will serve as the Secretary of the Military Mediation Executive Department in Beiping.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Violate Ceasefire Order, Continuing Attacks in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi Provinces</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou by Our Newspaper, 15th] Communist troops are still active in Lincheng on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. General observation suggests that the actual ceasefire process will begin in North China and end in northern Jiangsu. Since the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is located far away in Beiping and is still in the process of being organized, it is unrealistic to expect the Communist troops along the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, as well as in the mountainous regions of northeastern Anhui and southwestern Henan, and even in the marshlands of northern Jiangsu, to keep their word and immediately cease their political activities. Even if the ceasefire order from Yan'an has indeed been issued, it is doubtful whether there is only one version of the order from Yan'an. Fair-minded individuals in the capital today generally believe that the ceasefire order issued by the Communist troops has been dazzling, but there is no need to be pessimistic. After the government recently announced that Communist troops were continuing military actions in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, northern Shanxi, and northern Jiangsu, the Xinhua Daily did not refute it, and Zhou Enlai did not loudly protest, probably excusing it by saying that the order had not yet reached remote areas and that it was okay to gain a small advantage. It is a pity that the Communist troops are not seizing this precious opportunity to win the hearts of the people and quickly cease hostilities. If the work of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters cannot be quickly advanced from north to south, reaching Anhui and Jiangsu, it will be difficult for the refugees north and south of the Yangtze River to avoid suffering more hardships. The minimum request is that Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying should take the Jinpu Railway to Nanjing in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 15th] A spokesman for the Military Commission stated on the 15th that, according to the Xinhua Daily of the 14th, "On the third day after the ceasefire order was issued, the 94th Army invaded Fengrun." On the 15th, the newspaper continued to publish news that after the ceasefire deadline had expired, the Nationalist army in southern Henan attacked Guangshan, and the CCP representative office issued a telegram on the 14th stating that the National army in Hebei and other places had not stopped attacking. All of this disregarded the final deadline for the cessation of conflict (12:00 noon on the 13th of this month) and the true state of affairs, which is regrettable. After the committee telegraphed the agreed-upon measures for both sides to cease conflict and restore transportation on the evening of the 10th to all units for strict compliance, it successively received telegrams of reply from He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Army Headquarters, directors of various headquarters, directors of various pacification headquarters, commanders of various war zones, commanders of army corps, commanders-in-chief of various garrison commands, commanders-in-chief of guards, chairmen of various provincial governments, commanders-in-chief of various group armies, and army commanders, stating that all parts of the country had complied with the deadline. According to reports from various unit commanders, the Communist army continued to launch large-scale attacks in northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Northeast China, and southern Henan after the final deadline for the cessation of conflict (12:00 noon on the 13th of this month) had passed on the 14th. The commanders of these units have telegraphed requesting that the responsible persons of the CCP be notified to quickly and effectively stop the attacks. To clarify the situation for everyone, the Communist forces' attacks in various places after the expiration of the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The situation of Communist army attacks within the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict (until 12:00 noon on the 13th) (omitted).</p>
<p>(B) The situation of Communist army attacks after the expiration of the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict. Northern Jiangsu: (1) The Communist New Fourth Army gathered five or six regiments and launched a fierce attack on the government army west of Jiangyan Town (east of Taixian County) on the morning of the 14th. One battalion commander and many soldiers were killed. The attack is still continuing. (2) The Communist army continued to occupy the Damiao Station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway on the morning of the 14th and burned the station's machinery and sleepers. (3) The Communist army continued to besiege Xin'an Town on the 14th.</p>
<p>Shandong: (1) The Communist army attacked Yanzhou, Lincheng, and Chuanshan on the 14th with increased ferocity. (2) On the morning of the 14th, the Communist army launched attacks on Zhoucun and Zhangdian on the Jiaoji Railway. (3) At 3:00 a.m. on the 14th, the Communist army on the Jinpu Railway line from Lincheng to Hanzhuang and the Lanzao branch line once stopped attacking. The Communist army on the front line of Wang Hanzhuang even sent a letter to the government army, roughly stating: We (the Communist army claiming themselves) have received a ceasefire order. If the National army attacks, we will defend ourselves, etc. However, by 3:00 p.m. on the same day, the Communist army resumed attacking Zaozhuang and the Zaozhuang coal mine, and continued to attack government troops in various places for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Southern Henan: (1) The government army had already entered Guangshan City before the specified deadline for the cessation of conflict. According to a report from Commander-in-Chief Sun Weiru, there was not a single Communist soldier in Guangshan City on the 13th. It is evident that the Xinhua Daily's claim that the Nationalist army attacked Guangshan City after the expiration of the deadline for the cessation of conflict is entirely fabricated. (2) At dawn on the 14th, the main force of the Communist army under Li Xiannian launched a fierce attack on the 185th Division of the government army south of Luoshan from Dingyuandian (35 kilometers south of Luoshan). The division, strictly adhering to the order to cease conflict, did not retaliate, resulting in significant losses and was forced to retreat to the area 35 kilometers southeast of Xinyang.</p>
<p>Northern Henan: (2) On the afternoon of the 14th, the Communist army increased its forces to Anyang and Xiuwu, while intensifying its siege of the two cities.</p>
<p>Shanxi: (1) The 28th, 29th, and 30th Regiments of the Second Military Sub-district of the Communist Taihang Military District, totaling more than 2,000 troops with multiple artillery pieces, under the command of Lu Ruilin, Commander of the Sub-district, besieged Shitie Town, 30 li northeast of Jincheng on the Zhengtai Railway, on the morning of the 14th. By 4:00 p.m., the Communist army had increased to more than 4,000 troops, and the siege intensified. (2) On the morning of the 14th, Communist army units attacked the Fen Shui Ling belonging to Wuxiang, southeast of Shanxi. (3) More than 2,000 Communist army troops were approaching Fenyang County City on the west side of the Tongpu Railway on the morning of the 14th. (4) The Communist army is still besieging Zhongyang, Jiaocheng, Quwo, Yicheng, and other places. (5) The Communist army is still extensively destroying transportation lines in Shanxi. All of the above demonstrate that the Communist army has failed to comply with the provisions for the cessation of conflict and continues to attack in various places after the deadline, while the government army has strictly adhered to the order and repeatedly made concessions. The facts are clear. As for their claim that the National army entered Guangshan after the ceasefire, it is also a complete fabrication. In addition to notifying the Military Mediation Executive Department to handle the matter, this committee originally intended not to publish it, to show the government's tolerance and determination to cease conflict. However, because the Communist newspaper obliterates the facts and falsely accuses the National army, it has no choice but to refute it.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from a United Press Correspondent with Troops in the Northeast, 15th] According to sources here today, three hours after the order to cease conflict in various parts of the Northeast was issued at midnight on the 13th, the Communist army launched a counterattack and retook Yingkou. It is reported that the National army had recaptured the city five days earlier. It is also alleged that 5,000 Communist troops simultaneously violated the ceasefire order and occupied Goubangzi, Panshan along the Yingkou railway line. However, the National army repelled the Communist army and completely occupied the area today. According to reports, when the Communist army attacked Yingkou, a small number of National army stationed there resisted in an attempt to defend the city, resulting in some casualties. The number of Communist troops was at least five times that of the National army. Initially, there was only a small conflict, which then escalated into a large-scale war.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan Flies to the Capital Today</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 15th] Minister of Food Xu Kan is scheduled to fly from Chongqing to the capital on the 16th. Vice Minister of Food Lu Songzhou plans to wait for Minister Xu to arrive in the capital to discuss important matters before traveling along the Yangtze River to Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces. Representatives of the people from southern Anhui came to the capital to request the Ministry of Food to appropriately reduce quotas, improve grain collection and transportation methods, and severely punish unscrupulous public officials at the grassroots level of Anhui's grain administration. The Ministry of Food has accepted all of these requests and will discuss solutions after Minister Xu arrives in the capital.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Resumes Payment of Matured Bonds and Coupons</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency, 15th] The Ministry of Finance will resume payment for matured principal and interest coupons of various public bonds issued by the Ministry to the people in the recovered areas, in order to safeguard the rights and interests of bondholders.

<h3>Three Thousand Factories Left as Empty Shells, Difficult to Fully Restore Within Three Years</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Shenyang by the Central News Agency, 13th] The essence of Japan's 14 years of construction in the Northeast is all in Shenyang, which is also the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the 35 million compatriots in the Northeast over the past 14 years. According to experts, the high level of industrial development in Shenyang has surpassed that of Japan itself. As a result of Japan's concentrated efforts in construction, it had achieved the leading position in light industry in the Far East by last year. The total amount of investment by the Japanese in the more than 3,000 large-scale factories in Shenyang is still unknown, but one thing that can be said is that the total amount accounts for more than half of its total industrial investment in the country. Within three days of Japan's surrender, all factories in Shenyang were intact and undamaged. Unfortunately, they were soon destroyed, and all the essence was reduced to ashes. Among the factories operated by the Japanese in Shenyang, the larger ones numbered about 3,000, divided into (1) the western railway district, 489 factories; (2) the Dadong district, more than 400 factories; (3) the northern district, including the Haicheng district, more than 300 factories; (4) the Xiaoxi district, more than 300 factories; (5) the Nanshi district, more than 200 factories; (6) the Beishi district, more than 200 factories; (7) other urban areas, more than 300 factories. In the western railway district, where factories are densely located, 90% of the factory buildings have become empty shells, and even the windows and doors have been removed. The factories in the Dadong district have been burned down, and embers still remain. In the Dabeiqu and Xiaoxiqu districts, only broken machinery is scattered all over the ground. Major components are missing. The factory buildings in the Nanshi and Beishi districts are lying in deep snow, making it difficult to distinguish them. According to experts, it is unlikely that all factories in Shenyang can be restored within three years. In order to supply rice and wheat, the Shenyang Municipal Government is currently trying to put the rice and flour factories into operation. A small number of other factories may also be restored first.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the United Press] London, 14th, British officials today expect that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will issue a statement on Britain's transfer of the League of Nations trust territories to the United Nations Organization for trusteeship. According to British officials, the key to the dispute over the trusteeship system in the committee lies in the Soviet Union's suspicion that the trustee powers will be unwilling to transfer their trust territories to the trusteeship system. The Preparatory Committee's report on the trusteeship system contains a resolution calling on the trustee countries to "take practical steps" to transfer the trust territories to the trusteeship system.</p>
<p>Minority Nationalities and Parties Send Telegrams to the United Nations General Assembly to Petition, Arab Countries Express Their Wishes</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency] London, 14th, according to the Secretariat of the United Nations Organization, the United Nations Organization has received a total of sixteen telegrams from minority nationalities and parties from various countries in the world, requesting the United Nations to take action on the issues raised by them. Classified, three of them are about the current Spanish government, four are about Indonesia, two are about the Jewish issue, and two are about Northern Ireland. One comes from the "Armenian National Committee," requesting membership in the "Republic of Armenia." Another comes from the "Slavic National Committee" requesting Slavic independence. Jeb, Secretary-General of the United Nations Preparatory Committee, has prepared a memorandum for this telegram and sent it to the United Nations General Assembly Committee, which is scheduled to hold a second meeting on the morning of the 15th. Some of the requests are clearly unreasonable, but some may be considered.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters] London, 15th, a political reporter from this agency stated that the five Arab countries currently participating in the United Nations General Assembly in London plan to work together to obtain representation on the Trusteeship Council. If Iraq can join the Trusteeship Council, then the planned goals of the five countries, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, can be fully achieved. Egypt and Lebanon have each obtained a seat on the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, while Syria has also obtained membership in the Fifth Committee. Therefore, their aspirations have been 75% fulfilled. The victory of the Arab countries in the election is due to the assistance of Britain and South American countries.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Advocates for the Establishment of a Special Committee to Jointly Manage Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[Dispatch on the 15th] The United Nations General Assembly held its first policy debate yesterday. US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech, requesting the General Assembly to quickly establish a special committee based on the proposals of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain to manage atomic energy and ensure that this great new invention is used to seek human happiness, rather than to be used for more cruel mutual slaughter of mankind. Byrnes also called for an immediate start to ensure that countries place their land, sea, and air forces under the command of the Security Council, so that they can be used when necessary to stop aggression or restore peace. Byrnes also said that the establishment of a committee to deal with various issues arising after the discovery of atomic energy is closely related to security issues and cannot be separated. This is the only urgent task for all countries in the world. It is hoped that the General Assembly can quickly pass the US government's proposal to consult with the governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, China, France, and Canada, so that the committee can start working on weekdays. Byrnes continued, "Americans did not fully understand their responsibilities twenty-five years ago. Now, the US government and people have a deep understanding of their responsibilities. I dare to represent and guarantee the full and sincere cooperation of the United States. The United Nations Organization was produced by many countries and many peoples in unspeakable suffering and pain, and it must survive. In this atomic age, common interests should unite all free countries to maintain a friendly and peaceful world, which is far more important than any conflict of interest that can cause countries to disintegrate." Countries should cooperate in the United Nations Organization to develop a spirit of mutual understanding, not mutual suspicion. Both large and small countries should regard their power as a sacred right to serve the happiness of all mankind, not for selfish purposes. At this initial stage, it is unacceptable to expect "miraculous" solutions to all kinds of problems. In short, "We must be vigilant against stubborn unbelievers, and we must also be vigilant against stubborn enthusiasts."</p>
<h3>Whether the Japanese Islands Occupied by the US Military Should be Handed Over to the United Nations, the President Has the Right to Decide</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press] London, 15th, according to official sources today, the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly has not yet reached a consensus on whether the Japanese islands occupied by the US military should be handed over to the United Nations Organization for management. Diplomats in the US delegation favor handing over the Japanese islands to the United Nations for trusteeship, but General Kenner, the military advisor, advocates that those islands with military value should still be occupied by the US military. The final decision will be made by President Truman. The US military believes that if the islands obtained by the United States through war are handed over, there may be a danger of having to use troops to recapture them in the future, which is not a good strategy and should not be done. The United Nations Organization originally agreed to implement a preliminary trusteeship plan when it met in San Francisco. This issue will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion this week.</p>
<h3>Meeting Highlights: 400,000 Documents Released, 50 Miles of Telephone Wire</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The United Nations organization's first General Assembly is being held in the Central Hall, built by London lawyer Sir Buck, who has constructed numerous canals, bridges, and docks worldwide. He purchased the vacant land in Westminster a decade ago and built this Central Hall. Within the blue and gold meeting hall, 250 delegates from the United Nations gather, delivering over 12,000 words of speeches daily. Thirteen British and American stenographers and six French stenographers work in 15-minute shifts, meticulously recording every sentence. Each stenographer can record 250 words per minute. The newly installed telephone lines in the hall stretch for 50 miles, serving 250 telephones used by representatives from 51 countries. In the four days since the assembly convened, over 400,000 documents have been released. Before the assembly, various departments had already published 2.36 million documents, ranging from one-page news bulletins to 350-page reports from preparatory committees, with 2,000 copies of the latter printed. The United Nations organization's cafeteria serves 2,000 meals daily. Politicians from various countries, some of whom have never experienced queuing, must now hold their trays and wait in line. The British Red Cross first-aid station located at the Central Hall averages five patients daily, with a potential for further increase.</p>
<h3>War and Culture: Ancient Artifacts Discovered During Underground Defense Construction</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The National Geographic Society reports that numerous ancient relics have been discovered during underground defense construction projects in various countries during World War II. According to the society's 1945 excavation report, the following findings were made: (1) Caves dating back to pre-Roman times were discovered in Gibraltar, containing human jawbones, vertebrae, deer antlers, and pottery and stone tools. (2) Evidence of Celtic temples dating from 500 to 300 BC was found during the construction of an airfield in England. (3) Ruins of an ancient city dating back to 43 AD were discovered in the Canterbury region of England while inspecting bomb craters. In 1945, ancient settlements dating back 25,000 to 100,000 years were also discovered within the Soviet Union, along with a new island in the Laptev Sea in northern Siberia. Soviet scientists unearthed fossilized bones of an ancient giant, with a skull circumference of 33 inches and a femur length of 33 inches. The University of Chicago claims that layers upon layers of ancient city ruins were discovered 250 miles underground near present-day Baghdad, with evidence of ancient nomadic life unearthed in the lowest layer. Human settlements predating the Bronze Age have been discovered near Baghdad. An expedition team from the Geographic Society's seventh division discovered an ancient city in southern Guatemala, with eight major cities. Investigations suggest it is a relic of the Olmec civilization, predating the Mayan culture. When a British expedition team flew over the Arctic region, they confirmed that the North Magnetic Pole is indeed located at the center of the Sverdrup Islands, about 530 miles closer to the geographic pole than the Boothia Peninsula, which was long believed to be the North Magnetic Pole's location.</p>

<h3>France Attempts to Advance into Hanoi, Creating Tense Atmosphere; French Empire Ruled Vietnam for 80 Years, Neglecting River Maintenance and Causing Years of Famine</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hanoi, 14th] The atmosphere here is unusually tense today. Of the city's 180,000 residents, 20,000 are French. The Chinese occupation authorities have prohibited the French from carrying weapons, but armed Vietnamese soldiers of the Viet Minh Republic can freely move around the city. Mr. Bellin, the director of the Hanoi branch of the French Banque de l'Indochine, was recently assassinated in broad daylight. A French spokesperson stated: "The entire north has fallen into anarchy. There are no police in the city, coal supplies are cut off, and trains are stopped. From the French perspective, the situation in Tonkin has not improved since the Japanese surrender. If we are allowed to send troops here, order can be restored in a short period of time." There is currently no indication of when the Chinese troops will withdraw.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hanoi, 14th] Both French and Vietnamese sources indicated today that between 600,000 and 2 million people in Vietnam will inevitably die this year. Due to food shortages and severe cold, deaths are occurring one after another. Within two days, a United Press reporter found 400 bodies in one location in Hanoi. Vietnam has been experiencing famine for years, and this is now the second consecutive year. According to French official estimates, at least 600,000 people died of starvation last year. Viet Minh Republic President Ho Chi Minh announced that the number was closer to 2 million. The food shortage is due to the collapse of dikes in seven provinces of northern Vietnam (Tonkin), causing flooding of the Red River and submerging large areas. The French attribute this flood to the Viet Minh Republic, claiming it is completely incapable of managing the areas left behind by the Chinese occupation army, failing to utilize machinery, and preventing the French from carrying out repairs. The Viet Minh Republic President blames the French, stating that during their 80 years of occupation in Vietnam, they never taught the people how to protect the dikes. Although the American occupation of the Philippines was short, they taught Filipinos how to manage themselves. Rice for Tonkin used to be supplied by Cochinchina (southern Vietnam), but it is now occupied by the French, and the Viet Minh government receives very little. Before the surrender, the Japanese also tried their best to collect rice. The French also use agricultural production to supply themselves. In the disaster areas, supplies must also be provided to the Chinese occupation army and Japanese prisoners of war in concentration camps, further complicating the situation. Vietnamese workers must also be given small rations. The French claim that the Vietnamese have refused their offers to transport rice to help the people, but as soon as transportation is permitted, they will transport rice to Haiphong for relief, even if the Vietnamese seize it and distribute it themselves. The Viet Minh Republic President stated that the Vietnamese do not want the distribution to be managed by the government or French organizations. If the United States or other neutral countries distribute the rice, he would formally offer assistance.</p>
<p>Easing of Attacks on French [Central News Agency, Hanoi, 12th Special Dispatch] The disputes involving attacks on French people that have occurred in the Hanoi city area for the past three days have completely subsided today, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese military authorities responsible for security. Since the Japanese surrender and the entry of British and French troops into southern Vietnam, the poor discipline of the British, French and Indian troops and the improper handling by some military officials have led to continuous incidents of suffering for overseas Chinese since mid-September of last year, causing countless losses of robbery, death, and destruction to the overseas Chinese in Cochinchina. The overseas Chinese in Tonkin, motivated by righteous indignation, formed an organization to support the Southern overseas Chinese disaster relief effort. Unexpectedly, three days ago, an announcement was torn down by the French, leading to conflict. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Vietnamese revolutionaries transformed the situation into Vietnamese attacking the French, with more than a dozen incidents of French people being attacked in the past three days. Our military authorities stationed in Vietnam regret this unfortunate incident. Since our troops entered northern Vietnam to accept the surrender, we have maintained a neutral attitude towards both the French and Vietnamese. Now, in light of the strong public sentiment among overseas Chinese, we have immediately urged overseas Chinese to consider the overall situation and cease all activities. The planned memorial meeting for deceased overseas Chinese and the parade will not be held.</p>
<h3>List of Candidates for the Supreme Soviet</h3>

<h3>Prime Minister Shidehara Resumes Duties After Recovery, Attends First Cabinet Meeting; Implementation of MacArthur's Directives Still Faces Difficulties</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Prime Minister Shidehara, who had been resting at home since January 26th due to pneumonia, has resumed his duties today after twenty days of convalescence. He arrived at the Prime Minister's official residence before 10:00 AM and attended the first meeting after the cabinet reshuffle. According to various newspapers, the government is encountering significant difficulties in implementing MacArthur's directive to purge politics. The status of most of the 47 local governors is questionable, and the cabinet is struggling to cope. According to MacArthur's directive of January 4th, all key officials who participated in local branches of aggressive parties such as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association must be purged. However, many Japanese local governors also served as heads of local branches of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, creating a problem. According to Asahi Shimbun, the government is reluctant to replace local governments. The original plan was to apply this directive only to the secretaries-general of local branches of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. However, the new Minister of Home Affairs, Mitani, stated in his first interview with the press that he would replace local governors as soon as feasible. In addition, the cabinet finds it difficult to decide on the future of hundreds of other civil servants within the scope of the directive. Regarding the election date, MacArthur has granted permission for it to be held anytime after March 15th, and final preparations are underway. The abolition of military pensions is also a major issue for the Shidehara Cabinet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Japan is scheduled to hold a general election around March 15th, an unprecedented event in history. Several Shinto and Buddhist monks and two Christian leaders will also join the election.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Special Dispatch] Tokyo Governor Nagahiro Hisakuni resigned from the Ministry of Home Affairs today. His resignation was influenced by MacArthur's headquarters' order of the 4th, which required more than 20 people to resign. During the war, Nagahiro was a director of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Abolishes Licensed Prostitution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Police authorities announced today the abolition of 61 licensed brothels scattered across five concentrated areas. This is the latest development in Japan's democratization. This measure follows the abolition of human trafficking, which has been in effect in Japan since 1886, allowing impoverished families to sell their daughters into slavery. The abolished licensed prostitutes number 300, but they can continue to operate under the guise of "hostesses." It is estimated that there are currently over 2,500 unlicensed prostitutes in the Tokyo area, and their numbers are increasing due to the influence of the black market.</p>
<h3>To Commemorate the Late President Roosevelt, Various Countries Issue Commemorative Stamps; Roosevelt's Stamp Collection to Be Publicly Auctioned in New York, Becoming a Major Event of the Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] The name of the late President Roosevelt will continue to hold a significant place at this year's philatelic celebrations. At least five countries are planning to issue Roosevelt commemorative stamps. The public auction of his stamp collection in New York will also be a major event.</p>
<p>The most recent country to announce a Roosevelt commemorative stamp is the Republic of Haiti in the West Indies. It is said that the country will issue two black stamps, 20 centimes and 60 centimes, on January 30, Roosevelt's birthday, in commemoration.</p>
<p>Other countries preparing to issue Roosevelt commemorative stamps include China, Greece, Nicaragua, and Cuba. Liberia already has a 2-cent airmail commemorative stamp and two other ordinary commemorative stamps on the market. Nicaragua's commemorative stamps will be officially issued in June of this year, with six ordinary stamps and five airmail stamps currently being printed at a company in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>There are several Roosevelt photos on the stamps. One is of President Roosevelt sitting and examining his stamp collection with a magnifying glass. Others include a photo of Roosevelt with former British Prime Minister Churchill, Admiral King, and Admiral Stark during the Atlantic Charter discussions in August 1941; the signing of the declaration of war against Japan; and a photo with Churchill and Stalin at the Tehran Conference in November 1943. A photo taken in Casablanca in early 1943 with Churchill, de Gaulle, and Giraud will also appear on Nicaragua's commemorative stamps.</p>
<p>The US Post Office has only confirmed the issuance of two new stamps this year. One is the aforementioned 5-cent Roosevelt commemorative stamp, and the other is a military transport commemorative stamp, which will be issued in February. However, the design has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>Sweden will issue a new blue stamp to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the Swedish savings movement. The face value is 10 öre. The stamps are uniformly square, without serrated edges, but are only sold in books. The remaining 10-öre and 40-öre stamps with serrated edges will also be issued at the same time. It has been exactly 25 years since airmail service to the Americas began. Colombia has printed three stamps to commemorate the anniversary.</p>
<h3>Churchill Arrives in New York, Denies Rumors of Retiring from Political Life, Will Visit Roosevelt's Home in Hyde Park</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] Churchill, accompanied by his wife, arrived in New York aboard the Queen Elizabeth. Hundreds of people welcomed him. After disembarking, Churchill was surrounded by 200 journalists who bombarded him with questions. One journalist asked if the rumors that he was retiring from British political life were true. Churchill seemed surprised and said, "This is the first time I have heard of this. I have not considered it yet." Regarding Palestine, Churchill believes that this issue should not be handled by one country alone. He also told reporters that he hopes to visit Hyde Park and Roosevelt's home. A reporter asked if he was satisfied with the report that Hitler was dead, and he replied, "I believe Hitler is no longer alive." Regarding the secret of the atomic bomb, Churchill believes that the secret should not be given to others until there is a proper international agreement for its control. When reporters asked him to express his reaction to the British Labour government, he declined, saying he did not want to discuss domestic politics.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] Churchill said: "I hope to meet with President Truman in Fulton, Missouri, on March 5th and plan to give a speech there. I do not intend to stop leading the Conservative Party immediately, but must wait until there is a substitute."</p>
<h3>War Criminal Koki Hirota Turns Himself In to Sugamo Prison</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Koki Hirota turned himself in to Sugamo Prison today to be tried as a war criminal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander Otaki, who was arrested on November 6 of last year on suspicion of being a war criminal and detained in Sugamo Prison, has been released due to insufficient evidence. Otaki is very familiar with the living conditions of important Japanese war criminals, such as Japanese military leaders, cabinet members, and industrialists, in Sugamo Prison. He said that all important Japanese war criminals now have a fatalistic attitude. Before going to Manila for trial, Lieutenant General Homma expressed that the world has changed and that even the issue of the Emperor's survival is being discussed. Homma's words can represent the psychology of war criminals in general. Former Prime Minister Tojo often sits alone with his head down, looking dejected. The only book he reads in prison is "The Door of Power." Former Minister of Justice Matsuzaka, during whose tenure Sugamo Prison was built, once said: "If I had known I would be imprisoned here, I would have made sure to build it better." Former Commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Toyoda, no longer has the same prestige. He wears his military cap and often strolls around the prison, looking arrogant. War criminals sometimes gather to chat, but never mention the issue of trials. They are called outside by American military police for exercises, and they enter in single file for meals and sit down in order. Tojo sometimes does duty. He believes this method is in line with democratic ideals. In addition to working, war criminals also play cards during their free time and take a walk in the yard for one hour every afternoon. American prison guard Harley personally inspects the prison and listens to the complaints of the prisoners without any resentment. He approves all requests from the prisoners within the possible range.</p>
<h3>United Nations Delegation to Leave for Japan This Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] According to US State Department sources, the United Nations delegation planning to visit Japan to investigate the textile industry is expected to leave for Tokyo this week. Although the date has not been confirmed, it is believed that preparations will be completed by Saturday at the latest. It is said that the main purpose of the delegation is to study what methods can be adopted to restore the production of the Japanese textile industry as soon as possible to meet the daily needs of the Japanese people. In addition, the delegation may also consider a long-term production plan for the Japanese textile industry.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Promotes Plan to Develop Far East Fisheries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] After launching seven lightning strikes against Japan and gaining control of South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, the Soviet Union is now thoroughly managing them with full force. The fishing industry is gradually recovering and expanding. Factories are being established, and port facilities are also being increased. Workers and experts from the western Soviet Union are flocking to this new region. The Soviet Union has stipulated that the harvest of the country's Far East fisheries will be doubled this year. The Soviet Union has a far-sighted and ambitious plan to develop its Far East, and the recent design for South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands occupies a key position in the plan.</p>

<p>Wuxi: Russian Loses Huge Sum of Money in Train. Three Russian-American employees of the Shanghai Jiangwan Airport repair shop, Ivordin, Broshaekov, and Iseshkani, took a special express train to Nanjing the night before last, intending to transfer to Qingdao.

The commander of the XXX Army stationed in Changzhou, in order to effectively maintain local security and strictly prevent undesirable elements from mingling with the population, specially ordered the Political Department of the Army to launch a surprise household registration check on the evening of the 12th. The operation was conducted by the department, in conjunction with the special commissioner's office, military police, and local party and government agencies, mobilizing over a thousand officials and police officers, divided into one hundred and ten groups. At 9 PM that night, the groups gathered at the Army Political Department, where Deputy Director Guo gave detailed instructions on the precautions to be taken during the check.

<h3>Peace and Unity Cast a Thousand Rays of Light: The Consultative Conference Opens a New Page</h3>
<p>January 10th, 1946 at 10:00 AM is the starting time of a new history. The Political Consultative Conference, hoped for by the people of the entire nation, opened in Chongqing.</p>
<p>After the new rain in Bashan, the flowers and trees in the National Government were especially green, verdant and bright, setting off the infinitely lofty and majestic palace, and the atmosphere was especially magnificent. In the hall, dark red curtains were low, and the yellow velvet carpet was thick and soft. The camellias on the rostrum smiled and welcomed people.</p>
<p>The honor guard lined up in front of the National Government gate, solemnly saluting each representative. Except for Mr. Zhang Junmai and Mr. Modale, who have not yet returned to Chongqing, all thirty-eight representatives took the small cars allocated by the Secretariat and arrived early. The seventy-five-year-old Mr. Shao Congen was still supported by a young lady as he had been previously, and walked up the steps to enter the venue.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai Took the Lead. Mr. Zhang Yuejun and Mr. Zhou Enlai arrived before the meeting began. At 8:00 AM, they were in a small parlor at the residence of Special Envoy Marshall in Yiyuan, conducting negotiations on the signing of the ceasefire order. Therefore, when they walked into the venue, the entire room focused on Mr. Zhang Yuejun's smiling face. This smile brought unlimited joy to the conference.</p>
<p>The representatives' seats were divided into two rows and four rows, and behind them were newly opened seats for reporters and special guests.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Entered the Venue to Thunderous Applause. After all the attendees were seated, Chairman Chiang, amidst enthusiastic applause, stepped into the venue from the door in the right corner of the venue. The Chairman wore a grass-green military uniform, snow-white gloves, and shiny black leather boots. He was mighty and radiant, and his face was full of benevolent and joyous expressions, illuminating the entire venue. For a time, apart from the rise and fall of the spotlights and the sound of cameras, the attention of the entire venue was completely focused on the Chairman's smiling face. He nodded frequently to the representatives and slowly walked up to the podium.</p>
<p>The Announcement of the Ceasefire Order Filled the Room with Joy. Secretary-General Lei Ting reported the number of attendees and the meeting began:</p>
<p>The Chairman respectfully read the will of the Founding Father and, in his address, first said in a clear and joyful voice: "The negotiations on the cessation of military conflict have yielded results, and the ceasefire order can be issued today." This was like a thunderclap in spring, causing applause throughout the room, like a myriad of flowers blooming. The mercury lights flashed brightly, and everyone's face flashed with joyful and dazzling brilliance because of this good news.</p>
<p>At the end of his address, the Chairman announced four major events that should be implemented immediately, such as guaranteeing the people's freedom, which made the representatives of all parties present admire and be inspired, and the enthusiastic applause lasted for a long time. Amidst this expression of infinite respect, enthusiastic and prolonged applause, the Chairman stepped down from the podium and sat down in the first seat on the right.</p>
<p>The Old Man's Loud Appeal Touched the Audience. Next, Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, and Zeng Qi, the representative of the Youth Party, gave speeches. Mr. Shao Congen, a representative without party affiliation, cried out in an old and moving voice: "This conference can only succeed, not fail. The so-called success is the success of the country, the success of the nation!" He also said: "Congen is seventy-five years old this year and came here with illness. Today, I am saying this with tears in my eyes." Listening to the old man's call for the country, everyone in the audience was moved.</p>
<p>The Meeting Ended and a New History Unfolded. The meeting ended at 11:35 AM. However, the new chapter in China's peaceful unification began to unfold from this moment.</p>
<h3>Surviving Minsheng Steamer Assists in Re-establishment Transportation Work</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Company, which was established in the upper reaches of the Jialing River in 1925, initially started with shipping, raising a capital of 50,000 yuan and ordering a shallow-water tanker from Shanghai, 75 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, with 904 horsepower. It was completed in the summer of 1926 and named "Minsheng." Risking flood dangers, it sailed upstream on the Yangtze River and began operating between Chongqing and Hechuan.</p>
<p>Trial Operation Taking Into Account Both Passenger and Cargo Transportation</p>
<p>When Minsheng started operating, in order to avoid competing with failing colleagues, it decided to operate on the newly opened Jia Lingjiang Chongqing to Hechuan route. Generally speaking, peers mostly focus on cargo transport, shipping schedules are not regular. Minsheng changed to focus on passenger transport, trial operation of regular sailing, in order to benefit passengers. However, during the dry season, the river water drops and cannot be sailed, so the Chongqing to Fuling line was created. Although there are fewer passengers, but also cargo transport, business is still not bad, for Fuling prosperity, has a considerable contribution. At the same time, it was decided to build a more shallow oil tanker, hoping to be able to sail through the Chongqing Hechuan line all year round. In 1928, a new ship arrived in Chongqing, and the Chongqing Hechuan line had ships coming and going every day. At that time, Chongqing lacked repair shops, so a machine factory was set up in Chongqing to solve the repair difficulties. Later, a slightly larger shallow-water tanker was purchased, and three rounds were used to sail the Chongqing Hechuan and Chongqing Fuling lines. With the efforts of the crew, ships were able to depart every day. During the dry season, one ship sailed from Chongqing to Yibin. In 1929, Liu Fuсheng, the post-war relief director of Sichuan, felt that it was necessary to reorganize the shipping industry at that time, and firmly invited General Manager Lu to serve as the director of the Sichuan River Shipping Administration.</p>
<p>After General Manager Lu resigned from his position at the Shipping Administration and returned to the company, he moved the company from Hechuan to Chongqing. At that time, various Chinese steamship companies were still extremely scattered, each acting on its own, and their business was very sluggish. The Minsheng Company knew that the shipping problem in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was of great importance to Sichuan's external transportation and future development, and the critical situation could not be ignored, so it increased capital and took over steamships that were heavily indebted and unable to operate independently, or negotiated with companies that could merge with Minsheng. In 1931, it discussed with various companies between Chongqing and Yibin, and in the following year, it merged the companies and took over 11 steamships. In 1932, it further reorganized the shipping industry between Chongqing and Yichang, taking over 7 steamships within half a year, merging 4 domestic shipping companies and 1 British shipping company, and extending the route to Shanghai. It also took over 3 ships between Yibin and Chongqing, merging 3 domestic shipping companies, purchasing a Taikoo steamship that was sunk at the bottom of the water, salvaging it and repairing it, and re-purchasing a Standard Oil steamship. After another year, it took over 5 ships from the American Jiejiang Company. At this point, except for the British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Japanese, German, French, Jufu, China Merchants, and Sanbei companies, the Chinese steamships sailing on the Yangtze River in Shanghai presented a more orderly and unified situation.</p>
<p>Despite Many Difficulties, It Created Three-Stage Sailing</p>
<p>1. After Minsheng acquired a large number of steamships, it encountered a major difficulty. Because the acquired ships were old and in disrepair, and some were simply not suitable for sailing and needed to be thoroughly transformed. The slower ones were used for loading cargo, those with fewer passengers were used for more coal, and those with special passengers were either lengthened, the hull was improved, or the machinery and boilers were used to build new hulls, so as to maximize the speed and reduce coal consumption.</p>
<p>In 1937, the company mobilized all its personnel to collect steamships of all sizes and sailed in three stages to maintain uninterrupted transportation, creating the famous "three-stage sailing" in the history of the shipping industry in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>As Soon as the War Started, Minsheng's Tasks Increased</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance Against Japan started in 1937, Minsheng had a total of 46 steamships, large and small, with a total tonnage of over 24,000 tons, except for 7 ships still in the dockyards that had not been completed. At that time, Jiangyin was blockaded and Shanghai was cut off. Some pessimists believed that the life of the Minsheng Company was coming to an end. However, Minsheng believed that the start of the country's foreign war was the start of the company's mission, so it took the lead in mobilizing to participate in the war. By 1939, there were 37 steamships with a total of over 36,000 tons. When Nanjing, Hankou, and Yichang were successively evacuated, Minsheng went all out to evacuate government personnel and public property, school teachers and students and books and instruments, and people who took refuge. The withdrawal of various ordnance factories, steel factories, aviation equipment, and private factories was completed in two months in the first phase of 12,000 tons, and in more than half a year in the second phase of more than 80,000 tons, which was transported to Yichang. Two months later, all personnel and equipment were transported west from Yichang. At that time, the ships did not stop for a day, and no time was wasted. Because the upper reaches of the river were rapid and the shoals were dangerous, they used daytime for sailing and nighttime for loading and unloading. The ships arrived at the dock and the hatches had already been opened, and the cranes had been raised. The equipment on both sides was pre-loaded on barges to be loaded. When the ships arrived, the cones had not yet been thrown, and they were towed to the side of the ship by tugboats to load cargo. The workers worked day and night in teams of several or dozens, singing songs. The songs and the sounds of the cranes and whistles on the ships matched and formed a tragic symphony, showing the power of the Chinese people to mobilize and resist the enemy. The tense situation was comparable to "Dunkirk."</p>
<p>After the completion of the evacuation of various places, Minsheng still assumed the responsibility of military transportation on the water in the rear and general transportation. The ticket fees and freight rates were set by the government, but the expenses could not be limited and rose a hundredfold, resulting in insufficient income. The balance of payments was out of balance. After the War of Resistance, there were losses every year, and the support was difficult. Many of the main steamships and crew members were also sacrificed.</p>
<p>Continuous Investment in Business and Large-Scale Expansion</p>
<p>Shipping is the main business of the Minsheng Company. The machinery industry developed along with the shipping industry is the Minsheng Machinery Factory, which is directly operated. After the war, it developed to be able to undertake the repair of all steamships, and more than a dozen new ships and machine factory buildings were newly built. To avoid enemy air raids, in addition to dispersing to the surrounding area, a very large air raid shelter factory was opened in the mountains, where work could continue as usual during air raids. It is the only largest private mechanical factory in the rear and the only boiler manufacturer. The earliest indirect investment of Minsheng was in coal mines, assisting several coal mines in the Jialing River to build a light railway, forming the North Sichuan Railway Company, and promoting the joint organization of various mines into the Tianfu Mining Company, acquiring the machinery and materials of the Zhongfu Company, and mechanizing the mines, with a daily output of more than 1,000 tons of coal, supplying more than one-third of the wartime capital and Minsheng's coal.</p>
<p>After the Scars, Still Hope for More Construction</p>
<p>After eight years of hard work, one victory, the Minsheng Company's steamships first transported the National Army and demobilized personnel to Yichang, Hankou, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other ports. Minsheng currently has more than 6,000 employees on land and water, and more than 80 ships, which is less than 30,000 tons, and less than 2,000 ships can travel on the Chongqing-Shanghai line. The company took on the arduous task of the War of Resistance before reaching adulthood, and it helped the country. It is hoped that all sectors will give more support so that it can quickly develop and move forward after the scars, so as to enhance our recovery and construction. (Ke Zeng)</p>
<h3>The Myriad Ugly Scenes Spread Throughout Guangzhou: Public Trial of Traitor Chen Hongci</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in Guangzhou, Liang Feng</p>
<p>After the news of the public trial of the arch-traitor Chen Hongci on the morning of the 7th was revealed in the newspapers, it immediately caused a sensation throughout Guangzhou. This was because it was the first case of a public trial of a traitor, and everyone wanted to see it. This man, who had served as the puppet Guangdong High Court President and concurrently as the Military Law Department Chief of the Puppet Pacification Headquarters, was not only a prominent member of the "Wang Jingwei Clique" but also held the power of life and death in this area in the past. Today, he would stand in the very place where he had entrenched himself for five years, where he had sat high on the judgment seat and interrogated countless people, but now he had fallen to the status of a prisoner being interrogated. People wanted to see what kind of face he would show.</p>
<p>A Hook-Nosed, Rat-Eyed, Old, Cunning Scoundrel Reveals His True Form</p>
<p>The time arrived! The presiding judge, associate judges, prosecutor, and clerk, wearing their solemn official robes, entered the court in single file. The bailiffs, holding summonses, brought in the traitor Chen Hongci. He struggled to get through the crowd packed in front of the gate. Hundreds of pairs of eyes, like electricity, were focused on this one spot. Apparently, traitors also know shame, as he lowered his head and walked in, as if knowing the rules, to stand in the defendant's position in the court, bowing deeply to the presiding judge. One wonders what he thought when he saw the judge sitting above him.</p>
<p>Chen Hongci, under the gaze of thousands, was a tall man of six feet. He wore a bronze-colored cotton gown, covered by a gray long robe, Chinese-style leather shoes, and his hair was half bald and streaked with gray. His face was full of wrinkles, his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth drooped downwards, and the right side of his upper lip bulged slightly. His small eyes revealed a cunning glint. From his hooked nose and his composed demeanor, one could see that he was an old, cunning scoundrel.</p>
<p>Vehemently Scolding Wang Jingwei Sounded Particularly Jarring to Listeners</p>
<p>After the presiding judge inquired about his age and birthplace, he began to state his history and self-deceptive traitorous fallacies in an orderly manner, with a slight stutter but still in a vigorous voice.</p>
<p>"Sixty-four years old, from Panyu. In the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, when Zhang Renjun was the education commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, I was admitted as a government-sponsored student to study in Japan. Zhu Zhixin, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Li Wenfan, and the traitor Wang Jingwei, among sixty others, were all my classmates..." When he mentioned the traitor Wang Jingwei, the entire court burst into laughter. Everyone felt that the word "traitor" coming from the mouth of a traitor was particularly jarring and amusing. He seemed to have forgotten that he was also a traitor, and openly scolding Wang as a "traitor," such an attitude only earned everyone a burst of laughter. He, however, showed no embarrassment and continued to narrate clearly:</p>
<p>Knowingly Violating the Law, He Calls Himself an Old Judge Who Has Driven a Car for Ten Years</p>
<p>"After studying abroad for four years, I returned to China in the 34th year of Guangxu and served as an instructor at the Qingdong Law and Politics School. In the first year of the Republic, when Hu Hanmin was the governor of Guangdong, I was appointed as the director of the Military Law Bureau of the Governor's Office. In the second year of the Republic, when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, I was wanted. At that time, Long Jiguang occupied Guangdong and echoed Yuan, so I had to flee, following Zhu Zhixin, Deng Zhongyuan, and other earlier leaders, to do revolutionary work in Hong Kong and Macau. In the third year of the Republic, when Yunnan revolted, the wanted order was canceled, and the case inside was closed. In the ninth year of the Republic, I served as the director of the Xiamen High Court Trial Office in Gaoyao. In the eleventh year of the Republic, when Sun Yat-sen came to Guangdong, Chen Jiongming rebelled, so I lived in Shanghai with my father. In the fifteenth year, I returned to Guangdong and served as an administrative official, having served as the magistrate of Lechang, Qingyuan, Sanshui, and Dongguan counties. After the purge in the sixteenth year, I returned to the judicial field, serving as the president of the Zhaoqing, Chaozhou-Meizhou, and Shantou District Courts. I resigned in the twenty-first year. In total, I have been a judge for about ten years." When he mentioned Sun Yat-sen, he immediately stood at attention, and everyone, seeing this pretentious and strange behavior, couldn't help but laugh again. At the same time, when he said that he had been a judge for about ten years, everyone sneered at him, probably because he knew the law and violated it, truly wasting his life.</p>
<p>Stuttering and Shaking, He Only Admits to an Ideological Error</p>
<p>The presiding judge used a humorous tone to stop the laughter of the crowd and asked, "When did you join the puppet organization? Why did you join the puppet organization?" He answered, "I arrived in Guangzhou in August of the 29th year, and on September 1st, I joined the puppet government. At that time, the puppet provincial and municipal governments had already been established for four months! (He strengthened his tone, as if being a traitor was not his intention, otherwise he would have returned to the mainland earlier!) I am very ashamed to say that I was forced by hunger and cold. When I was in Hong Kong, Wang Jingwei sent someone to send me a letter, asking me to help establish a judicial institution and saying that he had not broken off relations with the central government and that he had returned to save the country and the people. Therefore, I fell for Wang Jingwei's trick."</p>
<p>The judge asked, "Joining the enemy is a heinous crime. Why didn't you consider it carefully? Even if you returned to the rear, the central government would not deny you food!"</p>
<p>He looked a little embarrassed and replied in a stuttering and trembling voice, "This was my ideological error. This was due to my previous blind faith in Wang Jingwei's character."</p>
<p>Foaming at the Mouth, He Asks the Court to Declare Him Not Guilty</p>
<p>The presiding judge further asked, "The Japanese invaded China, saying 'coexistence and co-prosperity' in words, but in fact, many things could reveal their conspiracy. Why didn't you come over to the right side?"</p>
<p>"I always believed that what Wang Jingwei said was true, and I did not do anything to harm the country or the nation." Chen Hongci argued stubbornly, citing his "meritorious deeds" during his tenure, in which Japanese agents and liaison officers were sent to interfere with the judiciary, but he rejected them sternly. The presiding judge then said humorously, "The Japanese are unreasonable. They don't care who you are. Moreover, did the Military Law Department try cases of anti-Japanese patriotic spies and guerrillas?"</p>
<p>Chen Hongci quickly stated, "The Military Law Department only tried theft cases. Anti-Japanese political cases were all tried by the police department, and the Military Law Department only had the power of trial and no power of decision." He vehemently argued that this crime of his was only a criminal "act" but without the criminal "intent," that he was only deceived by Wang Jingwei, that he did not rely on the power of the enemy puppet regime to cheat, and that he had the "saving the country and the people" facts. He spoke as if he had a strong case, with a colorful and impassioned delivery, waving his arms and foaming at the mouth, revealing the complete behavior of a traitor. Finally, he even shamelessly requested to be declared not guilty and presented a personally drafted defense statement of thousands of words.</p>
<p>The Defendant's Lawyer is Unwilling to Defend a Traitor</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer, Chen Qipei, then stood up from the lawyer's seat. He only submitted a statement, clearly showing that he was unwilling to appear in court to defend a traitor who was abandoned by the people.</p>
<p>Chen Hongci's hands trembled constantly as he held his confession. After signing the confession, the presiding judge announced that the debate could not be concluded and that the trial would be adjourned to a later date. The court adjourned! Chen Hongci, in a dejected manner, was escorted away under the watchful eyes of the crowd.</p>
<p>The sunlight shone on this seemingly ordinary but infinitely authoritative criminal court. Everyone had listened attentively to the "wonderful arguments" for more than two hours, and now they finally breathed a sigh of relief. The reporters packed up their notebooks and exchanged knowing smiles. This wonderful scene had come to an end! (Guangzhou, January 8)</p>
<h3>First Record of the Tense Negotiation Meeting: Pu De's Untimely Letter from the Provisional Capital - Seeking Peace Amidst Fierce Battle - Zhang Qun's Humorous Demeanor</h3>
<p>At the first plenary session of the Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Qun said frankly and humorously, "In order to achieve a successful agreement, the government has finally made concessions on Chifeng and Duolun as conditions to achieve the CCP's desire to unconditionally cease conflicts." Wang Shijie stood up and said, "Last time, Mr. Mao Zedong came to Chongqing and talked for forty-three days. The Political Consultative Conference was postponed for two months. I hope that these fourteen days will be enough." The reporter guessed that Foreign Minister Wang might still be concerned about the conference in London.</p>
<p>The Mysterious Thirteen Provinces and Regions: Due to Zeng Qi's questioning, Zhou Enlai recited the names of the thirteen provinces and regions with current conflicts (according to the Central News Agency report). However, the reporter and several other colleagues there seemed to only hear twelve. It is not known who is right and who is wrong. Now, we can only rely on the Central News Agency's report. Perhaps this is due to the difference in each person's "hearing"? Liang Shuming and Zeng Qi debated and spoke nineteen times, and there were also several times when they stormed out of their seats. According to the new psychological theory, a person's mental state cycles every thirty-three days, and perhaps he was just in a low period. We prefer to listen to verbal battles and fear the sound of gunfire. "Gentlemen use their mouths, not their hands." This is not an Ah Q-style approach; this is a modern democratic approach.</p>
<p>Gladstone's Fist Marks: It is said that the situation in the British House of Commons is even more heated. There is even a fist mark left by Gladstone on one of the seats! Moreover, this is only a new beginning in China! Seeking peace from verbal battles and finding common ground from differences is precisely consultation, and this is precisely the path that the Political Consultative Conference should follow! (Chongqing, January 11, night)</p>
<h3>Fifty Years of Struggle, Eight Years of War Resistance Result: A New Situation Unfolds in the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junzhang, Special Contribution to This Newspaper, Part Two</p>
<p>The Sino-Soviet Alliance: The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration were the confirmation of principles, while the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was the specific confirmation. This is because both Britain and the United States are far from the Northeast, and only the territory of the Soviet Union is adjacent to the Northeast. Moreover, there has been a complex diplomatic relationship in the past. Therefore, the convenience given by the Sino-Soviet treaty to China in recovering the Northeast is even more important than the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<p>The Treaty Itself: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed in Moscow on August 14 of this year. The treaty contains five items and two notes exchanged between the Soviet Union and China. The main points are extracted below.</p>
<p>The treaty itself contains eight articles. The main purpose is to jointly defeat Japan and prevent Japan from rising again to invade. Based on this purpose, there is military cooperation, joint use of bases, and joint management of railways. In addition, it is also agreed not to conclude a separate peace with Japan and not to join opposing groups.</p>
<p>Changchun Railway: The agreement on the Changchun Railway contains eighteen articles. The main purpose is to respect each other's rights and interests, strengthen the friendly relations and economic ties between the two countries. The method is to jointly manage and operate the railway, which will be returned to China after thirty years. Its scope includes the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway, namely the main and branch lines of the East Qing Railway in the Tsarist Russian era.</p>
<p>Dalian Agreement: The agreement on Dalian contains six articles (with a protocol attached). The Soviet Union recognizes Dalian as an inseparable part of China. Administrative power belongs to China. It is stipulated that import and export are free, and Soviet goods passing through are given convenience or preferential treatment. The effective period is also thirty years.</p>
<p>Lushun Agreement: The agreement on Lushun contains nine articles, stipulating that the port will be jointly used by China and the Soviet Union as a naval base to prevent Japan from rising again to invade. The defense of the area is entrusted by the Chinese government to the Soviet Union, while administration belongs to China. The appointment and removal of administrative personnel in the urban area will be carried out by China with the consent of the Soviet Union. The effective period is also thirty years. There is also an attachment that specifies the waters of Lushun.</p>
<p>Soviet Troops in the Northeast: The agreement on Soviet troops entering the three northeastern provinces contains seven articles, stipulating how the national government will establish institutions, implement rule, and cooperate with the Soviet commander after Soviet troops enter the Northeast for operations against Japan. An additional record states that Soviet troops will begin to withdraw within three weeks after Japan's surrender and will complete the withdrawal within a maximum of three months. (Note: The starting date for the withdrawal has now changed.)</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviet government sent two notes, the first of which stated: "Respect the sovereignty of China in the three northeastern provinces and reaffirm the recognition of its territorial and administrative integrity." The Soviet government also declared that "the assistance given to China in terms of military supplies and other materials is entirely provided to the central government, that is, the national government."</p>
<p>Chinese Sovereignty: In this treaty, we can say that the Northeast has been conditionally recovered. The basis for this condition is the war against Japan and the prevention of Japan's reemergence. The nature of this condition is different from the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Lushun and Dalian leased territories in the era of Tsarist Russia. The differences are: first, administrative power still belongs to China, and the Soviet Union has made a special statement on this point; second, joint management and joint use. All these two points are progressive points in the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and can also explain the general situation of the Soviet Union's friendly attitude towards China.</p>
<p>American Merit: In addition, there is one point that we cannot fail to know, that is, the establishment of this treaty was greatly facilitated by the United States, as can be seen in the report of former US Ambassador to China Patrick Hurley. This point shows that the United States hopes for Sino-US friendship but is even more willing to have Sino-Soviet friendship. In fact, the peace in the East can only be maintained with the friendship and cooperation of the United States, China, and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet treaty provides a concrete solution to the Northeast issue, the fuse of this Sino-Japanese war, which further proves that both China and the Soviet Union accept this trend.</p>
<p>Ensuring Results: Now, I want to draw a conclusion. From the above, we can see that the Northeast is an important issue in recent international politics. We Chinese have struggled for fifty years for the Northeast issue. Li Hongzhang came up with a method of uniting with Russia to control Japan in desperation. Due to the incompetence of the Qing government and the ambition of Tsarist Russia, many abuses arose, and the Chinese regime only managed to survive in a state of limbo. As a result of this long-term war of resistance, we have abolished unequal treaties, and we have transformed from a weak country to one of the five powers. This Northeast issue has also been satisfactorily resolved in law because of the victory. We have also said that the entry of the CCP army into the Northeast has caused setbacks in the reception work. From this, we can know how important unity is to solving national problems. We have struggled for the Northeast issue for fifty years to achieve this result. We must resolutely and firmly maintain this result no matter what.</p>
<p>Under Germicidal Lamps: Revolutionary American Drug Invention - New Penicillin Formulation Process</p>
<p>Inside an American laboratory, pharmacists wear uniforms, stand under germicidal lamps, and mix penicillin with oil and egg yolks. Injections of this new mixture allow the penicillin to circulate more slowly in the bloodstream, slowing its rate of absorption. Injections of penicillin alone often cause dramatic effects in the bloodstream, and the levels drop quickly, so repeated injections are necessary to control the spread of infection.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Peaceful and Bright, Still More Effort Needed</h3>
<p>In the past few days, the Chinese political situation has suddenly presented a peaceful and bright atmosphere, which can be said to have made great progress compared with three or four months ago. However, if we take a deeper, quieter look at the general situation and social conditions, it seems that the peace and brightness at this time are still in the initial stage, and how to cultivate this atmosphere still requires the continued efforts of the people of the country.</p>
<p>According to a special dispatch from this newspaper in Beiping, Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Chuangying will heal the wounds of North China in the cooperative atmosphere of the Union Hospital. Zheng has strongly advocated not settling old scores, and Ye also very much wants to integrate rural and urban areas, as if what negotiations could not resolve in nine years could really be completed satisfactorily in two or three weeks. To talk about peace, it is indeed extremely peaceful. However, hearing that Marshal Marshall is disrupting the agreement and advocating for those responsible to be reported is puzzling. The ancients said: Great faith is silent. When it comes to restraint and reporting, the word "faith" has actually been discounted. Confucius said "believed without being told," is difficult to find everywhere today, and is forced to seek the next best, but one hopes to be able to say and have faith, has been satisfied. Since the ceasefire order took effect at midnight on the 13th, logically speaking, if everyone is trustworthy, what supervision is needed? What are you afraid of being destroyed? What's the use of reporting? However, the Jiawang coal mine in Xuzhou Northeast is still being destroyed, the railway north of Lincheng has been demolished, and the Communist army near Hashan is still rushing to work on fortifications. Such things are unavoidable, and there is still some violence in the peace!</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Chongqing, in the fourth session of the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang representatives proposed a plan to expand the organization of the national government, and before the implementation of constitutional government, they first expressed harmony and co-operation and opened up the regime to show their public spirit. As for the four measures to protect the people's freedom, the government also limited the abolition or amendment of the existing laws and regulations within ten days, hoping to implement them as soon as possible. There are a number of representatives who are passionate and generous, saying that the latter must be done within two or three days, otherwise they cannot discuss the reorganization of the government, which is aggressive and does not seem to be a consultative attitude. Forgive us for saying something unpleasant, the "Political Consultative Conference" is not an organ for the exercise of political power, and the people have not authorized the "Political Consultative Conference," and the reason why the national government convened the Political Consultative Conference today is nothing more than to discuss with all parties and factions and comfort the people, so the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference should all think about how they can live up to the people, and they must not think that the national government should be responsible to the "Political Consultative Conference." To hope that the "Political Consultative Conference" is successful, we can only advise everyone to negotiate in a harmonious manner and not to be angry. If you leave in a fit of anger, and if you do not attend, if you do not change your old temper, you will definitely not learn "democratic demeanor," and the peaceful atmosphere will inevitably make people feel thin.</p>
<p>Looking at society again, let's not talk about other places, even if we talk about two or three recent events in Shanghai, we also feel that we have to work hard to be peaceful and bright. Seriously punishing traitors is not only what the people desire, but also the responsibility of the government. However, there are legal procedures for how to report, how to investigate, and how to try cases. In a democratic country, the people value the cultivation of the rule of law, and there is no exception in handling traitor cases. As long as the reporter is willing to bear legal responsibility, the High Court will accept it. At most, any other organ can only assist, not its supervisor, so there is no need to rush around and interfere too much. And the reporters should also recognize the path, be responsible for filing the complaint, and no longer use the mass movement approach, which only makes the society seem to have a state of lack of spirit of law, making the people in the recovered areas seem to be in danger. But on the other hand, the organs or chief officials who should be responsible for the report, knowing that people suspected of being traitors are at large and not asking questions, should not let the people be angry. Just to give an example, for example, Vice Minister of Education Hang in Beijing said that it has been decided to punish the traitors in the education sector, but we do not know when the report will be made? The Central Propaganda Department took over the film institutions during the period of the puppet organization, but who are the traitors in the film industry? For example, those who printed the primary and secondary school textbooks compiled by the puppet Ministry of Education to anesthetize the youth in the recovered areas, which bookstores were they? Which scum are in charge? We only hear a wave of take-overs of bookstores, but we have not seen a report of a bookselling traitor. Like this indiscriminate drag on, it is not necessarily a bright atmosphere.</p>
<p>Prices are rising, and the cost of living is high, so the society is full of air of increasing tuition, raising wages, and strikes. We must admit that people are rational and need food, clothing, housing and transportation. If the life of some people in food, clothing, housing, and transportation, even the minimum level is not enough, and other people are wasting their time, eating, drinking, and having fun, the society will naturally accumulate grievances. But on the other hand, as Wu Kaixian said, in the future international commercial competition environment, how to protect the lives and status of workers will be even more difficult. This difficult future is faced by the entire Chinese industry, not only the workers. Therefore, both labor and management must be of one heart and one mind, tolerate each other for the sake of the country, in order to overcome this difficulty. If you do not see this, and insist on taking extreme measures, then the misfortune of the Chongqing industrial community may spread to Shanghai, and both will be hurt, what is the benefit! As for the matter of increasing tuition fees for private schools in Shanghai in the next semester, it is also worth noting. If the increase is too high, how can the parents of students bear the additional burden? The number of out-of-school children will inevitably increase. If the increase is too small, the school is not enough to pay the expenses, and the teachers have no way to make a living. During the War of Resistance, the lives of public school teachers were the most difficult. In fact, those who wear long robes and rely on salaries are all worried. Now that the war has ended, if we allow the teachers to continue to tighten their belts, can we say that it is fair? The central and local governments should, on the one hand, stipulate the fee standards of private schools, and on the other hand, they should also take into account the difficult life of teachers. They may wish to extract some of the proceeds from the disposal of enemy and puppet industries or other taxes to subsidize the expenses of private schools and designate subsidies for teachers, so that the treatment of private school teachers is not far from that of public schools. We must know that educating people for a hundred years is a national plan, and the government must not be reluctant to spend this money. What's more, we value teachers the same, and we can't create a significant disparity in the treatment of public and private schools among teachers. To hope that the society is full of a peaceful and bright atmosphere, only from all kinds of places can the unequal factors be eliminated in the invisible. If there is no peace, there will be a protest. All peace, all brightness, must start from the word "peace"!</p>

<h3>Gold Notes See Slight Decline, Government Bonds Also See a Reversal, Chinese Stocks Appear Indifferent to Foreign Stock Plunge</h3>
<p>Spot gold opened slightly higher yesterday morning, at 883,000, and hovered around 880,000 for quite some time. Later, major Chinese stock holders sold stocks for gold, and general speculative funds followed suit, leading to demand exceeding supply, and a sudden rise to 895,000. At this point, the exchange rate against U.S. dollars rose to 605 yuan per ten taels, leading to some selling of gold for notes, loosening the supply. In addition, as noon approached, short-term holders couldn't hold out, so under the activity of sellers, it dropped to 863,000 at noon. In the afternoon, it fluctuated around 870,000, ultimately closing 7,000 lower than the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed at 94,000, fine silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars around 440. The black market exchange rate was tighter due to cigarette settlements, with tobacco merchants needing more funds. At the same time, rumors spread of tightening credit, causing slight tension, with interest rates standing at 10 to 12 cents.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar market saw weak demand from securities firms, and major players were inactive, while retail investors also held a wait-and-see attitude. The market could only follow spot gold. The spread between spot and forward prices widened to around 605 yuan, slightly attracting arbitrage purchases, and the market rebounded to around 1,465 yuan. At noon, it fell due to the decline in the gold market, eventually hovering around 1,440 yuan, closing 7 yuan lower than the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were supplied by the Swatow banks, where the rate was as low as 210 yuan compared to Shanghai, causing both old and new issues to fall due to abundant supply, closing 5 yuan lower for old issues and 1 yuan lower for new issues.</p>
<p>Many government bond holders sold, loosening the market. Intermittent speculative funds provided some fleeting rebounds. Class C bonds initially reached 1,410 yuan, but large holders sold government bonds to buy foreign stocks, disrupting the upward momentum. The market then fell to 1,295 yuan, with retail investors still buying on dips. At noon, it struggled around 1,350 yuan. The closing results showed Class A and B bonds down 80 yuan, Class C bonds unchanged, Class D bonds down 60 yuan, and Class E bonds down 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks fluctuated wildly, with an uncertain trend. Although many profit-takers sold stocks for gold, loosening the supply, the downward pressure was slightly greater than before. General speculative funds continued to participate in the stock market due to the upcoming New Year. There was no shortage of buyers after the decline, and securities firms rallied the market in the final hours, pushing it up again at noon. The closing results showed Wing On Cotton Mill up 120 yuan, American Oriental Bank up 50 yuan, Sincere Company up 30 yuan, King Fook Jewellery up 5 yuan, Sun Kwong up 6 yuan, and Dah Shing up 3 yuan. Unpopular stocks declined slightly due to the earlier closing of the retail market.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were still driven by Chinese speculative funds, with miscellaneous surplus funds also participating, making them quite popular. Foreign merchants sold heavily at higher prices. When Chinese stocks turned downward, buyers became more cautious, and the market fell by 5% to 10% from the high. At noon, all stocks were priced lower for the closing, with Jardine Matheson down 100 yuan, Wheelock down 1,300 yuan, and Jardine Brewery and China Paper each down 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Market's Rising Trend Flattens, Silk Fabric Buying Interest is High</h3>
<p>The price of artificial silk has gradually stabilized. Yesterday morning, No. 120 "Tianqiao" opened at 1,000,000 yuan, with the highest price being 1,020,000 yuan and the lowest closing at 967,000 yuan. "Dantong" opened at 830,000 yuan, with the highest price being 880,000 yuan and the lowest at 790,000 yuan. Rumors suggest that a large quantity of spot goods will be sold, and the market price may continue to weaken. Retail buyers and regular customers are tentatively buying, leading to high prices. Silk fabric transactions are frequent, and buying interest is very high. Natural silk fabrics have risen by 10% from the previous day. The China Silk Company sold each hundred "Meiya" bed covers at 720,000 yuan, and each yard of "Da Lai Ge Qianbi Crepe" was 2,050 yuan. Artificial silk fabrics like "Minsheng Brocade" and "Huajin Crepe" remained at the previous day's prices, and transactions were quite active.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Tighten Again</h3>
<p>The rice market saw prices rise by 100 to 200 yuan due to gradual increases in production areas. Indica rice and white rice both increased by 200 to 300 yuan. Flour from Nanyang moved without vigor, and prices remained stable. Soybeans from Zhoushan and Fujian remained in demand, and prices rose by another 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cakes from Swatow were selling well and continued to rise by 100 to 200 yuan. Raw peanuts remained scarce, and sesame seeds were also scarce, with prices remaining unchanged. Although affordable oil was being sold, the oil market saw a sharp increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to the scarcity of shipments from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Northern Goods Market Trend Flattens, Dried Longan Production Price Reported High</h3>
<p>The northern goods market has seen the trend turned to stability because it rose too much for the last few days, and the dealers were watching. The demand gradually became stagnant. According to a telegram from Quanzhou via Wenzhou, the production price of dried longan was higher than before, and even the price for Shanghai shipment was more than 30,000 yuan. In addition, the time for handling and shipping to Shanghai will be longer, and the interest will inevitably increase sharply, so the profit would only be slight.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Industry Resetting New Prices, Effective from This Week</h3>
<p>The dyeing and finishing group of the Dyeing and Weaving Association, with 30 factories that also provide dyeing services for customers, has recently adjusted its products and unified the labor costs. Starting from the 14th, the prices will be slightly increased. It is reported that the reasons are the lack of fuel and the long-delayed delivery of goods by De Fu Foreign Firm. The new dyeing prices are listed below (from Grade A Mercerized Shilong to light-colored standard cloth, all are 12 pounds and 40 yards of fine cloth, from Mercerized White Poplin to handkerchief cloth, all are 30 yards of grey cloth, and the last yellow-gray rainproof cloth is also 40 yards of fine cloth, unit of dyeing price: yuan)</p>

<h3>Jianfeng Textile Tender Below, Yarn Market Transactions Few</h3>
<p>The yarn market was sluggish yesterday, mainly because Jianfeng Textile Company tendered a large amount on the previous afternoon, which greatly impacted people's confidence. The market price fell by 40,000 to 50,000, and buyers waited and watched, resulting in few transactions. The market situation suddenly became a state of oversupply.</p>
<h3>Lumber Sales Still Good</h3>
<p>Recently, the actual sales of lumber in this city have been fairly good, because small carpentry workshops are mostly purchasing materials for decoration, such as Lauan plywood, etc. Building construction in Nanjing is about to start, and several batches have already come to Shanghai to purchase, so the market is quite stable. As for large-scale construction, it will have to wait until the lunar spring. The arrival of foreign lumber is also expected to be around April.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Active, Market Prices Generally Rising</h3>
<p>Since the gradual opening of transportation routes, the flow of red and green tea in this city has gradually recovered. Recently, in addition to the continuous shipments to Tianjin and Jiangbei, other places such as Hankou have also shown signs of recovery. The tea inventory in this city is very weak. Currently, the source mainly relies on land transportation, and there are still arrivals. As for waterways, due to the winter season and shallow river water, it is difficult to load and unload smoothly. Therefore, the market is always regretful for the situation of demand exceeding supply, and prices are also rising rapidly. Yesterday, the price of each variety increased by 4,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan per dan, and the transaction volume did not decrease.</p>
<h3>Tinplate is Scarce and Pricey</h3>
<p>24-gauge tinplate is a necessity for manufacturing rollers in cotton mills. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the stock on the market has been almost completely requisitioned. After this victory, small cotton mills are gradually resuming work, and are quite willing to purchase, so the remaining stock is even thinner. It is difficult to find whole boxes, but scattered transactions can still be met. The current price is 7,500 yuan per sheet. The price of other tinplate is also strong. 100-pound double-connected tinplate is selling for 75,000 yuan per box, and 112-pound kerosene tinplate is shouting as high as 35,000 yuan per box, creating an unprecedented new record.</p>
<h3>This City's Business Tax is Collected by the Central Government, Distributed to Local Areas</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] It has been decided that the business tax in this city will be collected by the Shanghai District Direct Tax Bureau, and a portion will be allocated to subsidize local finances, starting from October 21. It is heard that the business community hopes to continue the simplified collection method of the Finance Bureau, that is, the business tax should be allocated according to the business scale.</p>
<h3>White Tung Oil is Tight</h3>
<p>White tung oil has suffered the most since the war. Since the victory, international trade has gradually resumed, and exports are becoming more and more lively. When the prices of other goods fell, only tung oil could maintain its original state. Recently, the prices of other goods have also seen an upward trend, and tung oil has also become tight. The price of tung oil that meets the export requirements is 32,000 yuan per dan, and the price of tung oil that is only for domestic sales is 28,000 to 29,000 yuan. Genuine goods of old brands of Hongjiang oil will be shipped soon, so local products are currently selling for around 22,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Britain Lifts Trade Controls on China</h3>
<p>Effective January 9th This Year</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - The British Board of Trade officially announced that trade controls on China have been lifted. Effective January 9th, 1946, restrictions under the Trading with the Enemy Act on former Japanese-occupied areas of China (including the Northeast) have been lifted, and controls on foreign exchange for trade with China have also been modified.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The price of sugar has slightly declined today because the increase has reached the saturation point, but this factory's white sugar is still not available on the market.</p>
<p>Northern and southern goods, such as walnuts and persimmon cakes, have continuously arrived, and sales are relatively smooth, so the market has loosened.</p>
<p>Stationery is limited by the tonnage of cargo ships, and large items are retained here. Only small packages are transported to Kunming, Chongqing, and other ports by air, and the market is in a swirling situation.</p>
<p>The demand for caustic soda remains strong, and prices continue to soar. It is estimated that the arrival of overseas orders will take about three months. The factories are constantly importing, and the remaining stock is decreasing day by day, so the market price has risen by a huge 40% compared to last Saturday.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Holds First Press Conference</h3>
<p>Vice Minister Hang Reports on Handling of Peking Provisional University Incident, Reporters Raise Opinions on Strict Rectification of Academic Morale</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Nanjing] At 3 PM on the 14th, the Ministry of Education held its first press conference in the conference room. More than 30 people attended, including Fang Canglang and Zhang Anyu, reporters stationed in Nanjing for this newspaper, and Cao Tiancong and Wang Muliang, reporters stationed in Nanjing for the News Daily.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Hang Liwu presided over the meeting, reporting on the handling of the incident caused by a few students in the supplementary classes of the Provisional University of the Capital, and the work plan of the Ministry of Education for recovery, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Recovery Work [Vice Minister Hang referred to himself as a recovery worker], arrived in Beijing in December last year, and strived to implement the measures based on the Post-War Education Conference in Chongqing. In order to facilitate the direct handling of educational administrative affairs in neighboring provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education established offices in Chongqing, Nanjing, and other places in the rear. Therefore, the educational administration of the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai, and the five provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi, is currently handled by the Beijing office. Before January 6th, the Ministry of Education had already planned to improve various facilities for education in the recovered areas and rectify academic morale. Unexpectedly, a few students from the so-called "121 Student Association" in the supplementary classes of the Provisional University suddenly caused trouble, demanding the public release of English test papers and improved treatment, resulting in an unfortunate incident. He then reiterated the cause of the incident and the Ministry of Education's handling process. (Details have been seen in previous newspapers, and will not be repeated here). The Vice Minister mentioned that twenty years ago, when studying in Europe, he was a special reporter for newspapers such as News Daily and others.</p>
<p>Provisional University Incident This incident at the Provisional University has been consistently supported by various newspapers, guiding young people to the right track, for which we are deeply grateful. The English professor invited by the Provisional University is a first-rate professor with many years of teaching experience. The reason for the English test is that students in the enemy-occupied areas had too few English hours, resulting in low levels of proficiency. Although they are called university students, some are not even as good as junior high school students. After the test, those with poor proficiency will be given additional tutoring in order to gradually merge them into the class, and there is no malicious intent. As for student welfare matters, the Ministry of Education has tried to order iron beds, add bedding, and provide relief to poor students and students whose families are in the bandit areas. The students receiving relief account for one-third of the total, divided into two categories, A and B. Category A can borrow 3,000 yuan per month, and Category B can borrow 1,500 yuan. We are also in contact with the Army Headquarters to obtain coal to reduce the burden of student meals. The Ministry of Education is determined to thoroughly rectify academic morale, and hopes that all newspapers will support it. He then reported on various matters that the Ministry of Education has recently handled and plans to handle.</p>
<p>Inspect Various Regions (1) Send Ministry Inspector Peng Baichuan to inspect the education recovery work in various recovered areas, such as the extent of damage to school buildings and equipment, and the necessary supplements for recovery. All of this is related to funding, so the investigation must be based on facts in order to achieve practical coordination. (2) Send senior officials from the Ministry and hire experts to jointly supervise the education recovery work in the southeastern provinces and cities, hoping to fully recover within one year, the sooner the better, so that all students in the recovered areas have books to read. This matter is being actively prepared and will begin in Beijing and Shanghai first.</p>
<p>Standardize School Buildings (3) In the planning stage, there is national education. We will strive to standardize the school buildings and classrooms of elementary schools across the country, taking into account lighting, ventilation, student exercise, and physiological hygiene. Engineers will be invited to participate in the design and guidance, so that the future buildings will be very suitable for schools. They will be divided into three categories, A, B, and C, depending on the funding and environmental conditions, but at a minimum, there must be a Category C school building. Special attention will be paid to physical education for elementary school students. (4) For textbooks for primary and secondary schools, the Ministry of Education will unify the nationally designated editions in order to achieve appropriate uniformity after the war. We have entrusted Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and other publishing houses to jointly print them as soon as possible, and to review and approve the nationally designated and approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools for use in various schools. (5) For social education and mass education, it is necessary to increase the training of civic awareness among the people in the recovered areas. We plan to use radio stations and educational films to popularize the facts of the eight-year war of resistance to farmers in rural areas.</p>
<p>Hold Examinations (6) Urge the holding of examinations for teachers and staff in secondary schools, as well as examinations for teachers and staff in vocational schools and above, and examinations for university graduates. University graduates under the puppet organizations can still be hired on a trial basis. When the Ministry of Personnel later conducts examinations, those who have passed the examination will be issued a certificate by the Ministry of Education, stating that the student is equivalent to a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Laws, etc., but not naming the university from which they graduated. Vice Minister Hang also reported that he is a member of the Committee for Investigating Lost Cultural Relics During the War. The cultural relics investigated and received in various places will be cleared by the Central Government, and people will be sent to Japan to investigate and compile a catalogue, which will be used by our government to demand compensation from Japan in the future. After Vice Minister Hang finished his report, Counselor Zhao Taimou reported that the purpose of the trouble caused by a few students in the Provisional University was to maintain the original student status of the puppet Central University. In terms of administration, many compromises and concessions have been made in accordance with the resolutions of the post-war education conference in Chongqing, and he added many supplements to the details of the incident.</p>
<p>Reporters' Opinions Subsequently, Ma Xingye of the Central Daily News put forward three points, and hoped that the Ministry of Education's educational administrative measures would continue to hold similar talks when necessary in the future in order to exchange opinions. Then, female reporter Pu Lide of the Heping Daily pointed out that special attention should be paid to correcting music, so as to avoid hearing the chaotic, decadent, and inappropriate sounds of the enemy and puppets in the capital again. Gong Debai of the Jiuguo Daily expressed his agreement and expressed his opinion that the Ministry of Education should strictly rectify academic morale. The Ministry of Education expressed its acceptance, and the guests and hosts parted happily. (Fool)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Vice Minister Hang answered questions from reporters at the press conference: (1) Various agencies have not refused to hire graduates of puppet universities, but this is only a trial period. During personnel evaluation, it is necessary to rely on the certification documents after the examination by the Ministry of Education. This document only proves their equivalent degree and does not specify which school they graduated from. (2) The Ministry of Education is currently clearing the documents of the puppet Ministry of Education, and will punish education personnel who willingly collaborated with the enemy according to law. (3) The Ministry of Education has telegraphed famous professors such as Feng Youlan and Gu Yuxiu to lecture at various temporary university refresher courses.</p>
<h3>Mayor Agrees to Discuss Economic Assistance Measures for Private Schools with the Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>[This City News] Representatives of private primary and secondary schools in this city visited Director Gu of the Bureau of Education yesterday (15th) at 2 PM to discuss subsidies and tuition fees. Director Gu had already heard about the private schools' voluntary implementation of economic transparency measures, and the appropriate increase in tuition fees for students from better-off families, in order to expand the number of free places and provide relief to poor students. Therefore, he repeatedly praised this during the meeting, promising to plan for subsidies and to formulate flexible measures for tuition fees. As for the principals' request for instruction on the 18th, the Director has also approved it. The representatives then rushed to the City Hall, where Mayor Qian immediately summoned them. He inquired in detail about the situation of private schools, and quite agreed with the schools' opinions on enriching their content. He also said that attention should be paid to sports facilities and health education. After being informed that the school buildings of various schools had been occupied, he immediately recorded it in his diary. As for the economic assistance measures for private schools, he agreed to discuss them with Director Gu.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Issues a Notice to Ban Puppet Textbooks</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Chongqing News] The Ministry of Education issued a special notice to all education bureaus to strictly ban the circulation of puppet textbooks in various recovered areas, as some bookstores were still publishing puppet textbooks and some schools were still using them, which was inappropriate. (Parrot)</p>
<h3>Middle School Students Should Temporarily Not Participate in Political Activities</h3>
<p>Bureau of Education Convened Principals for Discussion Yesterday</p>
<p>[This City News] The Municipal Bureau of Education believes that in recent days, students from various schools have often participated in off-campus activities such as parades, which may affect their studies. Also, the case of the French Consul General obstructing our country's sovereignty may lead to serious international disputes. Therefore, it convened some public and private school principals to the Bureau for a talk at 3 PM yesterday. Attendees included the principals of Jin Yuan Middle School, Lequn Middle School, Shanghai Girls' High School, Minli Girls' High School, and other schools, totaling more than 20. Director Gu first reported the main purpose of convening the talk, stating that middle school students are not proficient in their studies and lack understanding. He hoped that the schools would encourage students to focus on their studies and temporarily not participate in political activities. Subsequently, the principals of various schools reported on the recent situation of students' off-campus activities. However, there were also cases where the names of schools were published in newspapers, but the students did not participate. After discussion, it was decided that on the 18th of this month, the Municipal Bureau of Education would, in the name of all public and private secondary schools in the city, send a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference and the Ministry of Education, appealing to all parties and factions not to allow middle school students to participate in political work, so that they can focus on their studies. Jin Tongyin, the principal of Jin Yuan Middle School, was designated to draft the telegram, and it was hoped that the principals of the schools would go to the Bureau on the afternoon of the 18th to sign and seal it, so as to ensure its timely dispatch and show its importance.</p>
<h3>Education Recovery Funds Approved for 60 Million Yuan, Jiangxi Provincial Government Stipulates Usage</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency Nanchang Dispatch] The Central Government has approved 60 million yuan for education recovery funds in Jiangxi Province. The Provincial Government has stipulated the usage as follows: (1) All existing schools should be relocated back to their original locations and properly allocated according to administrative regions. Each region should have one or two middle schools and normal schools, and vocational schools should be allocated appropriately. (2) Students should register themselves before the start of school, and no travel expenses will be provided. Travel expenses for the relocation of teachers, staff, and public property should be handled in accordance with the Central Government's measures for the payment of various expenses for the recovery of personnel from agencies in various provinces. (3) The original principals of the schools taken over from the enemy and puppets should hand over all school property for application. (4) Students should be assigned to study after examination, and teachers should be hired after examination. (5) The school buildings of the relocated schools should make full use of existing or received school buildings, and should be repaired and applied as much as possible, without the need to rebuild.</p>

<h3>Relieving the Economic Panic of Private Schools</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Should Promote Three Major Movements: Saving Schools, Respecting Teachers, and Rewarding Scholarship</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, educational construction has become a top priority, which no one can deny. However, in Shanghai, private schools in general, whether middle schools or elementary schools, are experiencing extreme economic panic during this period of transformation. To find ways to alleviate this and move forward on the road of "educational construction," I believe we should actively promote the following three major movements:</p>
<p>(1) Saving Schools Movement. Originally, the conditions for establishing a private school were, first, to have a board of directors, and second, to have a foundation. However, the situation in Shanghai is unique. Most private schools only have nominal boards of directors and no fixed foundation. The funding is generally raised through two methods: either lowering teachers' salaries or increasing student tuition. With the cost of living continuing to rise, if tuition is increased, students will not be able to afford it and will inevitably drop out; if we consider lowering teachers' salaries, teachers will not be able to maintain their livelihoods and will inevitably have to change professions. If students leave and teachers leave, can the school itself still exist? Even if a few students who can afford tuition can decorate the school's facade, the school will only be able to hire incompetent teachers who fill the ranks, which will only mislead the students. The existence of the school is worse than its non-existence. To maintain the normal existence of these private schools, we should universally promote a "Saving Schools Movement." The main purpose of this movement is to immediately reorganize the board of directors of the school, invite enthusiastic people from the community to serve as directors, and have the government give honorary commendations to those responsible for raising school funds and stabilizing the school's permanent foundation.</p>
<p>(2) Respecting Teachers Movement. Teachers should receive special preferential treatment from the country and society, which is a universal principle at home and abroad. However, the salaries of teachers in private schools in Shanghai are almost less than those of ordinary shop assistants, and even less than the wages of an ordinary servant. Teachers in primary and secondary schools, who bear the important responsibility of cultivating the nation's young seedlings, receive such meager treatment. Isn't the so-called "teachers first" equal to a series of uncashed blank checks? Therefore, we should actively promote a "Respecting Teachers Movement." The main purpose of this movement is to enable the government and the people to work together to build a psychology of respecting teachers. In addition to raising the salaries of teachers in general, we should also widely collect teachers' aid money to subsidize teachers and stabilize the lives of teachers who are suffering.</p>
<p>(3) Rewarding Scholarship Movement. In the transitional period of raising school funds on the one hand and immediately increasing teachers' salaries on the other, reducing student tuition is not an easy task. If students drop out due to the inability to reduce tuition, it is a phenomenon that the number of students entering a new country suddenly decreases. Isn't this a great shame and a great loss to the country and the nation? Under Chairman Chiang's creed of "Education First in the Period of National Construction," we should not only promote loan programs for poor students, but also actively promote a "Rewarding Scholarship Movement" for general students to complete the new educational construction of a new China. The main purpose of this scholarship movement is to select students with excellent academic performance and give them bonuses to show encouragement; for those who are even more outstanding, give their parents honorary certificates or medals so that parents can develop a mentality of "cultivating children above all else," and save on other expenses to do their best to plan a considerable amount of tuition for their children.</p>
<p>In order for Shanghai's private schools to overcome the current difficulties and to increase the basic construction power of education in the new China, it is hoped that these three major movements can be agreed upon and promoted by the government authorities and school authorities, and enthusiastically supported by the general public, and that they can produce significant and widespread results in the short term.</p>

<h3>Mr. Patterson Receives Reporters, US Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged, Discussed War Zone Situation with General Wedemeyer Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] US Secretary of War Patterson received reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. More than 50 representatives from Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies attended, accompanied by Patterson's aide, Colonel Gibsper.</p>
<p>Patterson first reported that he arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and discussed the situation in the China War Zone and subsequent issues with General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in the China Theater, yesterday morning. In addition, he also attended a meeting of 20 US military representatives, who requested to return home. Several requests were made at the meeting, and General Wei was also present at the time. Patterson also said that after leaving here, he would go to the Philippines for inspection and expressed regret that he could not visit Chongqing due to a delay in his scheduled itinerary.</p>
<p>Soldiers' Demands Will Be Considered. Patterson then answered questions from reporters regarding the points raised by the US military, Patterson decided to consider them. The question of the US military's mission in China and whether they could return home immediately would be carefully considered. Patterson added that General Eisenhower's speech to Congress yesterday was very important.</p>
<p>Consistent Policy Remains Unchanged Patterson stated that the US military mission in China and other issues discussed with General Wei were only details and did not involve US policy. US policy was decided by President Truman, and once decided, it would not change. The US policy towards China has three points: (1) to help create a democratic and united China, (2) to eliminate Japanese forces in China, (3) to help China transport Japanese soldiers back to their country.</p>
<p>Situations Differ in Various Places Patterson did not sell the US military's assemblies protesting, etc. He believed that they should appeal to the authorities and request consideration in a proper manner. As for other places, the situation is slightly different from here. Patterson did not see any protests in Japan. In Korea, only five or six people made the same request. Patterson does not intend to have further talks with the soldiers here.</p>
<p>When asked for his opinion on the US military's occupation in China, Patterson said that after the reports from General Wei and Admiral Kirk, commander of the Seventh Fleet, yesterday morning, the US military's occupation force in China was considered very small, which was far different from the US military's occupation force in Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>No Opinion on Marshall Regarding the Allied Control Commission for Japan, it is not yet known when it will meet, but when Patterson left Japan, representatives of the Far Eastern Commission had arrived in Japan and began their work. As for the liaison between the United States and the Soviet Union in Japan, a meeting was held yesterday by the liaison committees of both sides. When asked about Patterson's criticism of Marshal Marshall in Chongqing, Patterson said that although he and Marshal Ma were friends and colleagues for many years, they had not communicated recently, and all communications were only personal matters and had no opinion on their mission.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of Eisenhower's work, it was considered that General Ai had only been Chief of Staff for two months, and he himself did not think that General Ai had any reason to resign.</p>
<p>The Department of the Army Agrees to Set Up an Advisory Group There is currently no feedback from the United States on the establishment of a military advisory state in China. Mayor, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, heads of various municipal bureaus, British and American military and political officers, Deputy Commander Li and Lan of the Garrison Command, people from all walks of life in the city, and reporters, totaling more than 200 people, did not disperse until about 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>While the banquet was in full swing, the lights suddenly went out, and the entire venue was plunged into darkness. Only the glow of cigarette butts and joyful laughter could be heard in the dark. A minute later, the lights came back on, and the male and female guests all raised their glasses to celebrate the coming of "Chongqing's Brightness."</p>
<p>Patterson and Wei Visited Mei's Opera This time, the Chinese Seamen's Union and the National Diplomacy Association, the US Department of the Army quite agree with this move.</p>
<p>Secretary Patterson is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the Philippines today or tomorrow, and then go to various parts of the world for inspection, but the duration of his trip cannot be determined. Patterson stayed in Japan for a week.</p>
<p>Wei Held a Cocktail Party General Wedemeyer held a cocktail party at the French Club at 5:15 PM yesterday to welcome Patterson. Qian, and the four groups of the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association came to the city. In order to raise funds to help the families of the martyred sea carriers, Dr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Gao Hua were invited to hold a charity performance. Last night, US Secretary of War Patterson and General Wedemeyer went to the Empress Theater to admire the wonderful performances of Dr. Mei, Mr. Gao Hua, and the actors, and expressed their appreciation.</p>
<h3>Urge the French Consul-General to Reflect, Students' Parade Out of Patriotism, Lü Huaijun Talked to Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Fei Lihao, secretly arrested the Nazi criminal Frenchman Kako Pino in Shanghai and handed him over to the French warship Berdin for smuggling out of Shanghai, all sectors of this port have expressed indignation and telegraphed the government to take effective action in accordance with the law to protect national rights. The day before yesterday afternoon, 15,000 students in this port held a demonstration against France. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Lü Huaijun, secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and asked about the latest developments in this case. Mr. Lü answered the following points:</p>
<p>Mr. Li first said that regarding this case, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now in contact with the French government through the French ambassador to China. Before receiving orders from the Ministry, this office does not intend to take any further action. Regarding the rumor that the French Consul-General in Shanghai is still secretly arresting some criminals, this office has not heard of it, but considering the long-standing friendship between China and France, it is believed that the French Consul-General in Shanghai will not take any actions that harm China's legal rights and hinder Sino-French relations.</p>
<p>The reporter asked what the office thought of the demonstration by students in this port against the French Consulate. It was answered that our country is now a democratic country where the people have freedom of assembly and association. The people's assembly within the legal track has its own freedom of activity. Yesterday's student assembly and parade in this port was said to be in very good order. The speaker had seen this kind of thing abroad in recent years.</p>
<p>As for the rumor that the students who demonstrated yesterday took down the French flag from the flagpole at the French Consulate, the speaker had not heard of this and believed that the rumor was not true, because the students who participated in the parade were forced by patriotic enthusiasm, and the purpose was to urge France, which has a long-standing friendship with us, to reflect. The parade was in very good order, and it was said that our military police were guarding the consulate at the scene to prevent individual students from taking actions outside the legal track, so the speaker did not believe that the above-mentioned rumors were true. It was also heard that the Shanghai Student Union had stated that it had not taken the above-mentioned actions. Even if this happened, it should be dealt with in a separate case and should not be confused with the French consulate's violation of our legal rights.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked when the passport visa would be opened. It was answered that this matter is being requested from the Ministry, and the method will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Fourth Phase of Affordable Flour to Begin Selling Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The fourth phase of the Relief Administration's affordable flour sale has been scheduled to begin on the 17th. Every large cake stall, American cake stall, cut noodle shop, and steamed bun shop in this city will be allocated ten bags of flour, and the price will still be 1,900 yuan per bag (including the bag deposit fee of 200 yuan). The empty cloth bags must be returned in full before the fifth phase of the sale, otherwise the right to be allocated in the future will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Payment and Delivery Will Be Handled by District To reduce trouble and abuses, the General Administration will handle payment and delivery by district this time. Those who have already received the flour purchase certificate should pay attention to the number on the flour purchase certificate and go to the designated Shanghai Bank Zhongfu Bank Credit to receive the flour. The flour purchase certificate is green in the Huxi District, light cyan in the Central District, red in the Yangshupu Hongkou District, blue in the French Concession to Xujiahui and Huazhen, yellow in the Nanshi to Gaochang Temple area, light brown in the Zhabei Jiangwan District, and light red in the Pudong area. If there are those who have registered but have not been issued a flour purchase certificate, they are currently under investigation. Once the investigation is confirmed, the flour purchase certificate will be issued immediately, and the payment and delivery will be made to the designated bank with the certificate, and there is no time limit.</p>
<p>A Large Amount of Flour Will Be Released The first, second, and third phases of the affordable flour sale, the wholesale price also includes the bag deposit fee of 200 yuan. The General Administration has recently ordered all sellers to return the flour bags to the Fuxin and Fufeng Office in Renji Road Zhongfu Bank before the 31st of this month and receive the deposit back. Otherwise, it will not be accepted. The Finance Department of the General Administration has decided to release a large amount of flour in this city to meet the needs of the market and balance the price of flour in this city. Those who need to purchase it can purchase the flour at the price from the Fuxin and Fufeng offices at any time.</p>
<p>Fourth Phase of Sugar Price Revised The fourth phase of the enemy and puppet property disposal food affordable sale is about to begin. Each person is limited to purchasing one city catty, and the price is revised to 440 yuan per city catty, including the packaging fee. In addition, the Sugar Industry Association is entrusted to publicly sell 4,000 bags in order to suppress the sugar price. The meat, beef, and pork will continue to be sold at an affordable price, and the price will remain the same. Each person is still limited to purchasing five city catties of salted meat, 40 city catties of beef, and ten city catties of pork. The bureau will also entrust 5,000 boxes of Huangxiangmao soap to 1,000 Class A members of the Tobacco Exchange Association to start selling at an affordable price, with each box priced at 7,500 yuan. 63 tons of calcium carbide will be entrusted to the Japanese-China Oxygen Co., Ltd. and China Industrial Gas Co., Ltd., which are taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to start directly distributing to oxygen purchasing households and other industrial users at an affordable price.</p>
<h3>French Business Shashadian Workers Began Slowdown Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] From 8:40 AM yesterday morning, all employees of the French Business Water and Electricity Company implemented a general slowdown. At the same time, French Business trams and buses stopped selling tickets, but still drove as usual.</p>
<p>Five Requirements Proposed The reporter specially visited the company's labor union and learned that the slowdown was caused by the company's reply yesterday, which was unwilling to consider the employees' written requirements. The requirements can be divided into five items: (1) The salary in December of last year cannot be less than that in November, (2) The company once promised to consider the year-end bonus issue after adjusting the ticket price, but has not yet implemented it, (3) Adjustment of state base salary, (4) Assisting in the establishment of a labor union, (5) Abolishing the contracting system to protect veteran workers, etc. A labor representative once told this newspaper reporter, "Our slowdown does not affect public order, and we still take care of the public's transportation. Office staff also work as usual, and the water and electricity supply is as usual. If a reasonable solution cannot be obtained, we will continue to do so." As of the time of writing, it is still in a slowdown state.</p>
<p>Before the victory, Du Kelesituo, the general manager of the French Business Water and Electricity Company, had flattered the Japanese and presented the Japanese army with 15 buses, five large engines, gasoline and diesel tires, etc. The company's employees are now collecting various evidence to prepare to report it.</p>
<p>Year-End Bonus for Telephone Employees Resolved Liang Yongzhang, a representative of the Telephone Company Labor Union, told reporters yesterday that the company's request has been responded to by the company, stipulating that employees who have worked for more than five years will receive a month's salary as a year-end bonus, those who have worked for less than five years will receive half a month, and those who have worked for less than one year will receive one-twenty-fourth of a month's salary. The subsidy from December is 5,670 yuan. If there is less issued before, the company will allow it to be made up on the 23rd of this month. After the company's employees met last night, they were willing to accept it. As for the adjustment of the base salary and the same salary for the same level, the discussion will be reserved for later. It is also known that the Shanghai Telephone Company is also affiliated to the US headquarters. It has telegraphed to express sympathy for the strike of US telephone workers.</p>
<p>Six Major Companies Request a Salary Increase The labor unrest in major public utilities in this city has been frequent. This trend has also extended to the six major companies on Nanjing Road. The monthly salary of the employees of these companies is only 8,600 yuan. They are now demanding that the minimum salary should be 35,000 yuan. This request was made on the 12th, and as of yesterday, a sincere response from the virtuous party has not yet been obtained. They jointly requested the mediation of the Municipal Party Committee.</p>
<h3>Female Workers at Four Cotton Mills Strike Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, female workers from four mills in the city, including the Third Factory of the Wing On Cotton Mill, the Hongzhang Textile Factory, the Ninth Factory of the Shenxin Cotton Mill, and the Xinyu Cotton Mill, totaling more than 4,700 people, went on strike due to unmet demands for increased wages, year-end bonuses (50,000 yuan uniformly for both new and old employees), and the free distribution of half a bolt of cotton cloth per person. The Social Affairs Bureau received the news at 3:00 PM and immediately dispatched Zhu Guilin to mediate between labor and management. Simultaneously, the city's Party Headquarters also sent Fang Rusheng to attend. However, the efforts were stalled because the labor side could not produce formal representatives. The authorities are now willing to seek a solution within the scope of state-run cotton mill compensation to prevent the labor unrest from escalating.</p>

He resigned at the end of 1942, continuing to practice law. He founded the publication "The Voice of New China," advocating for the expulsion of Britain and the United States. After the victory, he was reported by the British Navy's Shanghai Office to the Municipal Police Bureau, arrested, and transferred to the court.

<h3>Fuxing Cargo Ship Sinks in Storm, Changxing Still in Danger</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Xinhua Shipping Company's Fuxing motor sailing vessel, which departed for Taiwan on the 6th, encountered an accident near Keelung on the 10th, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Fuxing was a 330-ton vessel, originally built by the Japanese Navy. Before completion, Japan surrendered, and the vessel was taken over by our Navy Department. The Navy Department then offered it for sale, and it was purchased by Xinhua Shipping Company through bidding. Subsequently, Taixi Shipping Company at 110 Sichuan Road leased it to operate to Taiwan. On the 6th, it departed from Shanghai for Taiwan carrying 219 tons of cargo, including 2,000 bags of flour and over 5,000 soybean cakes. On the 10th, it arrived near Keelung and was about to enter the port when it was struck by a strong wind and ran aground and sank in the Tamsui waters. The captain, Zhang Meibin, immediately sent a telegram for help. Fortunately, it was near the port, and various ships rescued some of the crew members who reached Taipei. However, after the ship's accident, the company had not heard anything until the Taiwan Provincial Government's Shanghai Liaison Office received a telegram from the Taiwan Secretariat inquiring about the passenger and cargo situation. The company then learned of the accident and yesterday reported the tonnage of the cargo and the details of the 27 crew members. It is also learned that the vessel was a cargo ship and did not have passenger berths, so it did not carry passengers.</p>

<h3>Reborn from a Cruel World</h3>
<p>— Our reporter to Suren</p>
<p>Why does everyone pay attention to Hui Zhu? Because she is young, beautiful, affectionate, and has committed suicide. However, these are all things of the past. Now Yan Xuanzhu is "Willow leaves are not drawn for a long time," she converted to Catholicism, and said that only God's grace can save her and make her suddenly have a sense of belonging. Forget the past, be a new person, devote herself to drama, and embark on the path of true life.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Mei's careful study of art For friends who care about her, she expressed her heartfelt thanks; for those who abuse attacks, she hopes to have facts to prove them in the future. Dao said that the biggest reason for coming to Shanghai this time is to prepare to follow Mr. Mei Lanfang for a long time and accept Mr. Mei's artistic teachings. Because Mr. Mei has passed the age of fifty and will not have many opportunities for her to observe, he should meet Mr. Mei every day to ask for advice and watch every scene.</p>
<p>Social ruthlessness prompted her to become world-weary: The reporter met Ms. Yan and she told me these words. Then, she narrated the reasons and process of her suicide in an extremely frank manner, which was the same as Mian's suicide note. The biggest reason for her world-weariness was that she felt the coldness of the world and the ruthlessness of society. Various rumors are certainly caused by something, but she thinks that there is no need to make a fuss about a normal social interaction. A female performer is also an ordinary person with flesh and blood and emotions. She needs friends and the comfort of love like others. She believes that she has this right and admits that she is considering marriage. She said that marriage does not conflict with career.</p>
<p>The white cap of the nurse gave her inspiration: At three o'clock in the middle of the night on November 8 last year, in the former capital, a woman quietly swallowed a large number of sleeping pills, without tears, without pain, she asked for a release, like every smart person asked. It was not until twenty-seven hours later that she regained consciousness, heard familiar voices, and saw the morning light of the clear morning. But she did not give up the idea of leaving the world. Her heavy and weak limbs made it impossible to end her life. She wanted to go on a hunger strike, but the doctor told her: Injections can also prolong life. Just when she was at a loss, the white hat of the female nurse in the German hospital gave her the light and courage of life. She thought that others were working busily, serving for faith and for the people, why couldn't she do this? She can also be active. With this inspiration, a woman who was about to fall into hell converted to the Lord and was baptized with great sincerity, doing Mass every morning and evening. In this way, she gradually calmed down her moving heart. She was saved, she was reborn.</p>
<p>Reforming Pingju and working hard to move forward Now, religion and art are her two pillars. The former only requires sincerity and persistence, while the latter also depends on her own initiative. She said that the dance surface of Pingju must reform the color of big red and big green, and the arbitrary movement of the viewers is enough to distract the audience's attention. As for the original essence, such as singing, posture, and all symbolic techniques, should be preserved so that Pingju can show the full oriental color. She said that Mr. Mei has almost completed these points. She herself has recently performed "Xi Shi's Rebuilding the Country" in Beijing, and she has done her best to improve in this regard.</p>
<p>Madam Chiang's letter is earnest and sincere: At the end of last year, President Chiang visited Ping, and she once wrote a letter to defend herself, because the Commercial Daily had published that she had dealings with the enemy and puppets. Later, the newspaper was reorganized. She also wrote a long letter to Madam Chiang, mentioning women's issues. Half a month later, a reply came, expressing sympathy for the ground and encouraging her to live bravely.</p>
<p>Conflicting psychology creates misfortune In the quiet corner of the D.D.S. cafe, during a two-hour conversation, I could feel that a woman who had been through a lot of hardships had an extremely conflicting psychology. In the past, she sometimes wanted to go up, but unconsciously, she made a net and dragged herself back in again. As the saying goes: "Reflexively being smart", Yan Pingzhu is such an unfortunate woman.</p>
<h3>Qian Dajun Encourages Students from Various Schools to Accumulate Talent and Dedicate it to the Country: Demonstrations and Protests Must Obtain Permission</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor and Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison Command Qian Dajun issued a statement on the recent demonstrations and protests in the city, stating: "Several demonstrations and protests have occurred in the city recently, none of which have been approved by the Songhu Garrison Command, and they were held without authorization, which is very inappropriate. The city is still under martial law, and according to the provisions of the Martial Law Act, such actions are prohibited without the approval of the Martial Law Commander.</p>
<p>Should be prohibited, but considering that the participants this time are, The actions are not too excessive, and they may not be fully aware of the martial law orders, there is no understanding, so it was not forcibly stopped. Huai Ci is only a special case, and should not be considered a normal practice or imitated. In the future, if there are demonstrations, you must submit an application for approval in advance in accordance with the regulations. If the demonstrations are approved, the Garrison Command will be responsible for ensuring their safety. If you take action without permission, it will not only violate the law, but also It may cause accidents, I hope all sectors pay close attention and try to avoid it. It is also important to note that the majority of the participants in this gathering and march are students. Students are the future foundation of the country and should pursue learning as the primary goal. The eight-year war of resistance, the relocation of schools, and the lack of equipment</p>
<p>The lack of equipment has had a huge impact on students' studies. Now that the war has come to an end, the schools are gradually returning to normal. Students from all schools should take this opportunity to work harder to make up for the past and encourage the future. Moreover, our country is now in a great era of national construction and needs a large number of specialists. Students must also encourage themselves to study hard and contribute to the country. Parents and teachers of all students are responsible for teaching their children and cultivating young people. They must repeatedly explain this meaning and teach them earnestly so that young people can accumulate talent and contribute to the country, which is what we hope. At the cocktail party, Mr. Patterson shook hands warmly with the citizens of Qian</p>

<h3>A Trip to the Cemetery to See the Flowers</h3>
<p>— Tang Liyan</p>
<p>The cemetery used to be a place for the people of the city to relax and enjoy themselves. After the enemy invasion, the flowers, trees, pavilions, and terraces were almost completely destroyed. Three years ago, the poet Tang Liyan went to Beijing to pay his respects and wrote a piece called "A Trip to the Cemetery to See the Flowers," which was in the spirit of Du Fu's "Lament by the River." Now that the enemy has been driven out and the country rebuilt, when the hibiscus flowers bloom again, he revisits the old place. What will his feelings be?</p>
<p>—Editor's Note</p>
<p>In the third month of Jiangnan, spring is like a sea,</p>
<p>Countless flowers sway in the breeze.</p>
<p>After three years, I revisit Moling,</p>
<p>The scenery is unchanged, though the river has been altered.</p>
<p>I remember when the flowers in the cemetery were at their best,</p>
<p>Willows with green foliage were mixed with spring grass.</p>
<p>I met you with a smile in a carriage on the road,</p>
<p>Whose young lady dropped her whip, leaving a jade ornament?</p>
<p>Whose young gentleman is so charming,</p>
<p>The emperor's son has no worries, Lady Mo Chou has no sorrow.</p>
<p>Every night, songs of "Jade Tree" are sung in the back courtyard,</p>
<p>Every morning, the Cold Food Festival is a spring outing.</p>
<p>The women of Wu and Yue have faces like jade,</p>
<p>Their curved bodies bring spring to life, charmingly adorned.</p>
<p>Walking among the flowers, I see no one,</p>
<p>People are like flowers, never tiring of looking.</p>
<p>Among them are several relatives of imperial concubines,</p>
<p>With bright earrings and emerald feathers, even more outstanding.</p>
<p>Their embroidered shoes and silk stockings are worth a thousand gold,</p>
<p>The five colors are dazzling, gathering like clouds.</p>
<p>One day, the barbarian cavalry filled the land,</p>
<p>The nine-layered city produced smoke and dust.</p>
<p>The country was overthrown because of the beauty of three women,</p>
<p>The flowers that bloom are all that remain of the Six Dynasties' spring.</p>
<p>Everything is like this, following the turning candle,</p>
<p>The chess game is repeatedly overturned.</p>
<p>Li Bai sings "The Road to Shu is Difficult,"</p>
<p>Du Fu, the old man of Duling, swallows his tears and cries!</p>
<p>Returning like a crane, I stop at the country's gate,</p>
<p>The wind and rain of Maoling want to turn to dusk.</p>
<p>Spring is growing old on Le You Yuan,</p>
<p>Plum blossoms have fallen, and cherry blossoms are flourishing.</p>
<p>Alas! Though the cherry blossoms flourish, they also fade quickly,</p>
<p>We will see tomorrow that the wind and rain will be terrible.</p>
<h3>The Victory that Dazzled Her</h3>
<p>— Mang Di</p>
<p>Many, many self-examinations, or opinions, complaints, and even urgings, are constantly modifying and restraining her new demeanor—victory.</p>
<p>It's as if she had just put down the wooden bucket for milking cows—that inferior thing—and was invited into a magnificent hall of the upper class. She felt excited wearing such a gorgeous dress, adorned with such beautiful red flowers, and standing among these esteemed people. Perhaps she simply couldn't contain herself. Then, she felt someone was watching her.</p>
<p>Jealousy? Contempt? But it certainly wasn't a look of kindly praise! So she examined herself, restrained herself, and began to feel that her footsteps were too heavy; no, that her shoes were too tight; her skin too rough; her teeth too black; or even that her body was too short... She whispered, as if scolding her reckless younger brother in front of relatives: Be careful! Be cautious! Don't be so unrefined and lose face!</p>
<p>But she felt constrained! She really couldn't learn their way of walking—so generous and leisurely—perhaps because she couldn't exchange these too-tight shoes? She secretly massaged her face and the back of her hands, but it hurt and didn't remove the rough skin! Impossible! Ashamed! Everything...! She began to angrily and dejectedly complain about herself, cursing herself, but she seemed unwilling to take off and hide the glorious gains—the dress, the red flowers, the status—and pick up the wooden bucket for milking cows—that inferior old companion—to strive for her success and future. She no longer trusted that in this inferior, old company, she could find new, real success. She didn't understand the distance and interests between her and those esteemed people, and she was obsessed and dazzled by this new demeanor. She thought that such fashionable adornments would only allow her to aimlessly wander among those esteemed people, but that was always better than the effort from that inferior, arduous, old life.</p>
<p>She really disagreed: Before one has real success like those esteemed people, there's no need for empty restraint, modification, and cursing. One should stand on one's own ground and continue the efforts, whether old or new, that one can do for oneself. She was really obsessed and dazzled by the new demeanor—victory!</p>
<h3>Winter Night</h3>
<p>— Qian Cao</p>
<p>Tonight, I heard the call of the wilderness, and my heart began to feel restless. Although we all have passionate hearts, filled with the flames of love, who can understand whose heart?</p>
<p>People need to be honest with each other. But when a naked stranger stands before you, takes off his mask, you will surely find him hideous, even say that he is inhumane.</p>
<p>In fact, I also know that honesty is precious.</p>
<p>Then let me honestly tell you: I want to tie tonight's moon and tomorrow's sun together with a long rope.</p>
<p>However, tonight's moon? Tomorrow's sun? This is simply a dream.</p>
<p>Tonight, even the moon's shadow is imprisoned, so what else can be said?</p>
<p>In the frosty night, the sky is very heavy. Walking on the deserted street, I feel infinite desolation. Alas, why don't I go back? What am I doing wandering the streets?</p>
<p>The frost of winter nights will freeze my heart.</p>
<p>The winter night sky will not have blue lyricism.</p>
<p>I returned from wandering the streets, bringing back infinite coldness, making me tremble, making me feel desolate.</p>
<p>Tonight, my pillow is soaked. Ah, am I really crying?</p>
<p>I have never shed tears easily, just as I don't cherish my feelings. I often sacrifice my feelings unconditionally and without value, and what I get in return is only some ethereal poetry.</p>
<p>But tonight I shed tears because I couldn't suppress the impulse of my emotions.</p>
<p>I didn't dare to cry out loud, I just buried my head in the quilt and sobbed. I didn't want anyone to find me crying.</p>
<p>Why bother? My heart is already broken. Why deceive others' tears with my own sadness? Every tear has its price.</p>
<h3>I Returned Empty-Handed</h3>
<p>— Xiao Meng</p>
<p>I returned empty-handed, still wearing the tattered gown I had when I left home; a gust of wind blew it, making it dance like a butterfly. Looking again at the scar on my leg, the mark from the battle at X Mountain. With a mocking tone, it also looked directly at me. I felt bottomless bitterness... Thousands of faces, familiar faces. Following me, mocking me, ridiculing me. Making me unable to lift my head.</p>
<p>"Idiot. Hah! Such a stubborn spirit, doesn't being an official mean getting rich?" I remember the nickname the pointy-headed special agent gave me behind my back—"Yu Zi" (Stubborn).</p>
<p>Yes, I am a stubborn one, a small stone in the stream that refuses to go with the flow, with many thorns and angles. But I remain calm in the face of these insignificant cold barbs and hot sarcasm. On the contrary, my few heartfelt words when I said goodbye to my subordinates brought tears to my dry eyes. This was perhaps the first time in my life that I was truly saddened? Tears flowing from the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p>"Comrades: Open our weak eyes and look! Is the motherland healthy? The so-called celebrities and big shots who know how to get ahead and cheat have deceived the world. Yet they sit high on the throne as great heroes and big shots. China, China..." I shed tears for my own painful, trembling tone. The brothers were also moved to tears, silently, the sound of tears and hearts intertwined.</p>
<p>This was what I said to my brothers when I asked for a long leave and it was approved, before we parted. I shed hot tears, wetting my clothes. Go, go! Shameful and despicable tears, take back these bitter tears. Now I will never cry again—I am a traitor.</p>
<p>Now I return empty-handed, still wearing the tattered gown I had when I left home; a gust of wind rises...</p>
<p>Pen Under Heaven</p>
<h3>"Officials" and "People"</h3>
<p>— Xie Dongping</p>
<p>The bureaucratic politics of China for thousands of years have clearly divided officials and the people into two separate lines. Officials are a class, the so-called scholar-official class. Officials can always be officials, and they can be rich generation after generation. Officials not only govern the people but are also always above the people. I really hate the nice-sounding term "scholarly family." In reality, the so-called "scholarly family" is just a big family that talks about formality, hypocrisy, superficial rituals, and a strong official air.</p>
<p>If the bureaucratic system is not broken, any talk of democracy is empty. The so-called "returning power to the people," this return just returns the power to the officials. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether it's returned or not.</p>
<p>In Chinese society, officials have always led the lives of the people. On the one hand, officials seem to be setting an example, and on the other hand, they enjoy special rights and interests. As the saying goes, "The magistrate is allowed to set fires, but the common people are not allowed to light lamps." This "setting fires" is the special right and interest of officials. You cannot light lamps because you are not an official but a commoner.</p>
<p>Now that times are different, this situation should be reversed. The so-called reversal is not "commoners are allowed to set fires, but the magistrate is not allowed to light lamps," but rather the leadership of officials by the people should be transformed into the leadership of officials by the people. The people ask the officials to do things, but the officials must listen to the people.</p>
<p>In Chinese society, it's infuriating to say, ordinary people are not qualified to speak. If you say something, those official-minded people will ask you, "What qualifications do you have to say these things?" In fact, his qualifications are the highest. He is a commoner. He can control the officials. He has the right to say anything to the officials.</p>
<p>If the people really lead the officials, and the officials no longer have any special rights and interests to enjoy, then those who are enthusiastic about being officials will no longer want to be officials. The position of official will be given to those who are enthusiastic about doing things. The status of the common people will be raised, and everyone will be willing to be a commoner. The world will be peaceful, and that will be the much-touted democracy.</p>
<h3>A Pair of Lovebirds (5)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo was two years younger than Mr. Mo. She had considerable beauty, liked to dress up, and came from a noble family, so she was very particular about enjoying herself. Perhaps this was her shortcoming; because she couldn't endure hardship and couldn't be frugal with her life, she didn't have any savings.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo met Mrs. Weng the Second in Beijing, and now they met again in Jingzhou. Mrs. Weng the Second's situation was similar to Mrs. Mo's. Mr. Weng married Mrs. Weng the Second in Beijing, and then sent her to Jingzhou. Mrs. Weng the Second was exactly the opposite of Mrs. Mo. Her character was as weak as rubber. You could knead her into any shape, and that's what she would be. But she was prettier than Mrs. Mo and could sing a few arias from Peking opera. It was said that Mr. Weng married her for these two advantages. But later, she got old, and Mr. Weng lost interest in her. Mrs. Mo sympathized with her situation, so they became good friends. Mrs. Weng the Second relied on Mrs. Mo to make decisions for her in many things. Although some people advised Mrs. Mo not to get too close to Mrs. Weng the Second because of her somewhat improper background, Mrs. Mo didn't listen. Mrs. Mo thought that the more proper a person was, the more improper things they would do. So Mrs. Mo stubbornly sympathized with Mrs. Weng the Second and helped her. They were inseparable every day. Later, Mrs. Weng the Second simply moved into Mrs. Mo's house. This went on for four years until Mr. Weng and Mr. Mo returned from Beijing, and then they separated.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo and Mrs. Mo lived separately in the north and south, each trying to find pleasure and enjoyment as much as possible. Neither of them invested in property, so when the end came, they were all very poor!</p>
<p>The last days of the Qing Dynasty finally arrived! The Revolutionary Party swept away the imperial family in Beijing and established the Republic of China. All the wealthy officials of the Manchu banner people were turned into commoners. It was at this time that Mr. Mo, along with Mr. Weng and Mo Sheng, the old servant who had served him for more than ten years, fled to Jingzhou in a panic and surrendered to the ladies.</p>
<p>With this, Mrs. Mo became even more lively and tried her best to torment Mr. Mo. She wanted to retaliate against him for the ways he had wronged her in the past. She not only did this herself but also taught Mrs. Weng the Second to do the same. These two gentlemen became prisoners of the two ladies, and these two prisoners sympathized with each other and became good friends.</p>
<p>For the first half of the year, they were still able to get by. In the second half of the year, they had to rely on the thirty or so piculs of rice harvested from the few dozen mu of land that Mrs. Mo bought to support the family. Not to mention not being able to eat bird's nest and white fungus for breakfast, even Western food gradually became vegetarian. When Mrs. Mo was craving something, she would invite Mrs. Weng the Second to go to a small restaurant to nourish herself. Or she would buy some fish or meat, and the two of them would hide in the room and enjoy it secretly. The two gentlemen didn't get any, and they didn't dare to express any opinion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo also assigned Mr. Mo a job, which was to teach their precious son, Baoling, to read. In this way, Mrs. Mo saved the cost of hiring a teacher, and Mr. Mo didn't feel like he was being supported for nothing. In fact, Mr. Mo himself didn't want to sit at home and do nothing, but he didn't have the opportunity to work. He couldn't be an official again, and he couldn't live the way he used to.</p>
<p>Baoling was already nine years old at this time. He was very smart and had seen some of the estrangement between his parents, so he often used innocent actions to try to mediate their atmosphere and ease their feelings. But it was useless. Mrs. Mo was unmoved and didn't forgive Mr. Mo at all. She didn't let Baoling call him "father" and told Baoling that Mrs. Weng the Second was his "father."</p>

<h3>Small Office Workers Have a Hard Time Getting Around, Asking for Free Tram Rides, Because the Round Trip Fare is Too High</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have long admired you as the voice of the people, dedicated to serving society. The public has benefited a lot from your help. I have an opinion that I would like you to appeal for. The reason is that there are so many banknotes circulating on the market now, with counterfeit money piled up, and legal tender still in large stacks. Using it is really like throwing money away, making poor scholars unable to use it and feeling a little envious. Take the small office worker of the salaried class as an example. The monthly salary is very small. After calculating, you first have to pay rent, then buy rice, then buy firewood, and buy vegetables. A small family of three or four people already feels stretched to make ends meet with the seven necessities of life. Expenses for clothing and entertainment are simply out of the question. As for social engagements, of course, they cannot be included in the calculation, but they are often needed. The even bigger problem is that you must first take out a portion from this very meager salary as tram fare, to get from home to the office every day. Before, when the fare was small, the round-trip fare was already painful to pay. You must know that these people are not in the ranks of department heads, and there will be no cars to pick them up. They must also arrive at the office on time to sign in, so they have to take the tram. Now that the tram fare has been increased, the authorities, in order to be considerate of business difficulties and avoid labor unrest, have allowed them to increase the price, but they have neglected the small office workers who don't have the fare. If they rely entirely on running with two legs, how can they get to the office on time? I saw an author in a certain newspaper talking about "hoping to give preferential treatment to students taking the tram." That's right, there are many poor students who should ride the tram for free, but small office workers in various agencies must also receive the preferential treatment of riding the tram for free. The authorities should sympathize with this and issue an official document. Businesses will not refuse to accept it. But what is this little bit of income worth to businesses! Once it can be realized, a group of small office workers will all be convenient and everyone will benefit, and they will inevitably sing praises of virtue all the time. Respectfully wishing you good health, Zhou Jun, a reader.</p>

<p>Seeking Zhu Po Xing Zhu Natianxing, a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang, resolutely enlisted in the army at the start of the July 7th Incident, holding the ambition to defend the country and kill the enemy. At that time, correspondence was frequent. In 1937, he sent a letter of appointment from Duan Heng, commander of the division, appointing him as attached to the Heavy Machine Gun Company of the 641st Regiment, 321st Brigade, 107th Division of the Army. After Ningbo was captured, news was cut off. At home, there are still an old mother, young younger brother, and weak younger sister. Please military and political officers who know his whereabouts, please send a letter quickly to comfort the hope of the family. Correspondence address: Gu Yuanshun, c/o Continental Hotel, Xizang Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Seeking Wu Guotai My elder brother Guotai, a native of Sai'an County, Guangdong Province, is currently 31 years old. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, he served in the children's corps on the battlefield, and then withdrew west with the National Army to Yingkou, Jiujiang, and other places. Later, I learned that he was working as the assistant director of the Central Aviation Corporation's wireless station in Yunnan Tianlei. Until the outbreak of the Pacific War, there was no news. Since the victory, there has been no news. Colleagues of China Airlines who know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Wu Guoan, Room 101, No. 30, Lane 195, Tianjin Road, Shanghai, so that we can be reunited, with kindness like rebirth.</p>
<p>Seeking Chen Lei Chen Lei, courtesy name Nianci, is a native of Jinshan. He went to Guiyang to work two years before the incident. At first, letters were still exchanged, and there was still a letter from the Dragon Boat Festival in 1944, saying that he was going abroad to study, but since then there has been no news. Now, because his mother's stomach disease is critical, she misses her son very much. I hope that friends and gentlemen who know his whereabouts, please give me a message immediately, Zhang Youren, pastor of the Jesus Church in Jinshan, Jiangsu, with immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>Seeking Shi Chaoxiang (i.e., Little Monk) A native of Haimen, Jiangsu, 19 years old, was an apprentice in a car dealership in western Shanghai. He usually said that he wanted to be a monk. He suddenly disappeared when the victory was announced. It has been several months since then, and there has been no news. His widowed mother is at home, crying day and night, thinking about her son and becoming ill. If there are benevolent people who know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Mr. Zhang, No. 210 Kangding Road.</p>
