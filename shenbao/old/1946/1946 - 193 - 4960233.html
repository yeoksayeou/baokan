<h3>京滬路修復通車　前陳凱旋號特快車出軌之前　曾見行跡可疑者徘徊其地</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十一日電〕京滬鐵路凱旋特快車十日在周涇巷出軌後，業涇路局派員搶修，已於十一日下午二時五十五分正式通車。惟錫滬錫常等區間車暫停，十二日起各班可照通常行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬路無錫周涇巷問之路軌，自十日第二次凱旋號特快車出軌損毁後，業經兩路局派員搶修，當於十一日晨二時五十分全部修畢。十一日晨七時正，凱旋號特快車照常由上海北站開出。其餘谷班客貨車，亦照常行駛，一切均已復常態。據兩路局副局長侯或華吿記者稱：此次車輛出軌情形，及路面毀損程度，誠爲勝利以後所僅見，渠本人於接獲出事報吿事，即乘汽油車趕至出事地點勘察。發覺：（一）鋼軌未斷；（二）機車與客車輪軸未斷；（三）所有機車及各車輛底盤均完整；（四）所有軌道上之魚尾板，並無分裂情形。基於以上諸點，可證明此次出軌，常非出於技術上之疏忽。再據其他方面消息：周涇巷出事處路軌呈平直綫，即因多雨基礎不固，最多脫軌，絕不至於傾覆，且經調查視察後，路基並無陷落現狀，故此事顯爲捻去道釘，尤以淸晨五時，曾駛過客車一列，未生事故，縱然速率不同，亦未至出此大險，故路局正在搜集資料，加緊調查中。</p>
<p>又據悉：撲撲京滬道上之政府高級官員，常成凱旋號特快車，蓋取其快捷準時，故此次出軌事件，當出於俗共黨有計劃之破壞。聞出事之前夕，曾有人瞥見有形跡可疑之人一羣，在出事地點附近徘徊云。</p>

<h3>關於指責行總問題　我發表重要聲明　分配救濟物資係以需要為基礎　惟因交通破壞推行時自有困難</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕關於指資中國政府及行政院善後救濟總署之問題，中國政府發言人，今日發表下列聲明：猶憶今年五月聯合國善後救濟總署署長不滿意該署駐華分署之工作，遂將駐華分署署長凱塞氏，及執行長奧爾謨斯旦德氏免職，而以賴氏爲代理署長，賴伽第亞先生之代表洛克斯將軍，曾向中國政府說明任命賴氏爲暫時性質，將另行物色聲望更隆之人，爲永久署長，前新澤西州州長愛狄生氏，亦爲物色對象之一，中國政府有鑒於該項職位任務，頗爲煩重，要求將永久性之署長，早日派定。人事更迭所發生之顯著影響，爲使上海分派至內地之救濟物資，突然减少，在人士未更迭之前，每星期分派之物資，約在二萬五千至三萬噸之間，物資之運赴各地者，較運達上海者，更爲迅速，其後在八個星期之一段時期內，分派之物資，僅十一萬一千噸，平均每星期不到一萬五千噸，在六月之第二個星期以內，上海運出之數量，竟低落至三千五百噸，目前運出之數量，不若運達上海者之迅速，指責者且謂行總並未將聯總物資，公平分配於中國共產黨，行總分配物資，係由蔣署長廷黻主持，而由聯總監視人，從旁協助，蔣署長受中國政府之訓令，分派物資，必須視需要而作公允之處理，中國政府分配救濟物資之政策，係以需要爲基礎，絕無其他政治方面之考慮，惟因交通破壞，推行此項政策，自有其必然之困難，至於所稱政府未將應許之經費，撥交行總一節，余可確切聲言，行總原預算四五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，政府曾立予撥發，且因聯總物資，未能如期到達，及聯總運來之棉花，不足原定之數，故中央銀行，另以國幣三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元借給行總。由於上海碼頭之擁擠，而躭延物資運往內地之時間，聯總署長賴伽第亞要求中國政府派譴代表等聯總代表，商討改組行總，俾成一效率更大之執行機構，原定上星期四，舉行會議，惟因聯總駐華代表，尙未奉到賴伽第亞署長授權之命，遂砥期至本星期六，據謂：賴氏（駐華分署長）因新婚後，赴北平旅行，會議再須延期舉行云。賴伽第亞署長停止一部份救濟物資運赴中國，一般入最初印象，以爲此乃一種政治性的行動，實則由於上海港口擁擠之故，據報吿，有輪船十四艘抵達口外，正在等待碼頭空位，賴伽第亞署長有電報一通，致宋院長，此電係由賴氏（駐華分署長）所轉致，可以說明眞相。電文如次：「賴加第亞署長指令，除糧食外，立刻停止運赴中國之救濟物　　品，業在航程中之船隻，不受此項限制，理由爲中國未能迅速分配，六月七賴伽第亞上蔣主席電中，業已說明重要糧食之機續運往中開者，須由駐華分署之督導及證明」，行總接到後，立即分派內地駐華分署總辦事處，及各分區將繼續盡最大之努力，協助行總改善分配狀况，以物資分發至最後消費者之手，俾出淸現存之物品而使聯總駐華分署，在財政運輸及政治方而有正常理由，得以提出建議。按照原定之物資供應計劃，繼續接濟中國，吾人之艱巨工作，目前方在開始，余信賴聯總全體同人，必能克服一切困難，加倍努力，而完成此項計劃也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕中國駐美大使館今日聲明：聯合國善後救濟總署中國分署職員向總署長賴伽第亞所發報吿，顯係片面之辭，據此下斷語，實屬不智。聯總救濟物品之被阻，係受運輸困難影響，中國經過長期抗戰，交通一時不易恢復，亦屬事理之常。中國負責當局發表盡詳聲明後，民衆方面對於此種情事，自能獲致更準確之瞭解。</p>
<h3>行總尚未接正式通知　蔣署長今日招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「行總」發言人稱：「聯總」自發表停運若干救濟物資來華後，雖已引起各方極大注意，但該署迄未接到正式通知，「行總」之態度，仍須至今日下午三時蔣署長在都城飯店招待中外記者時始可揭曉。</p>
<p>蔣氏已有　三點表示</p>
<p>惟蔣氏事實上對此已由表示，略謂：（一）賴伽第亞是否有權不經聯總會議。而這採取此項片面行動，彼深表懷疑；（二）「行總」所獲器材之中，有若干並不適合我國需要，此次停運之物資，或即指此項器材；（三）共黨所需之物資中，彼等所獲之百分羅並不低微，共區內並不缺乏食糧，共黨當局且曾表示願以共區內之食糧換取彼等所需要之物資，而此類物資，「聯總」供給甚少，如布疋，手搖紡車，醫藥用品等，共黨所獲之醫藥爲數不可謂少，有時「行總」竟特在華購取醫藥，以供彼等之用；（四）「聯總」職員對總署之申訴，蔣氏拒不置評。但指出此事發生之際，正「行總」加緊對共區救濟之時，如烟台成立辦事處，並在魯南黃河災區加緊救濟，「行總」並派卡軍一百八十輛專司運輸，但交通不便，確極困難，若干地區，竟毫無運輸辦法？（五）最近物資運輸，雖曾遭遇若干阻撓，但經「行總」折衝之後，多數困難，均吿解決。</p>

<p>這幾天，中國大局眞像「山雨欲來風滿樓」了！好戰之徒，似已到了圖窮七見的階段。司徒雷登新任大使的發表，雖一般人希望其能有助於我商談，但政治空氣異常沉悶。五人會議旣無什麼結果，三人會議又未必即開。中共「七七」宣言後，宣傳戰的鑼鼓敲得比以前更響。共軍的十路總司令業己派定，陸軍而外更有空軍司令，「登壇拜將」之後，共軍大概決心發動全面攻勢了。</p>
<p>我們抬頭一看，時局正如夏天的氣候，四面八方的烏雲，一團一團集攏來：蘇北的共軍圍六合，迫揚州，而海門縣城也危在旦夕；津南的共軍突入靑縣，佔風化店，進犯滄縣；魯中的共軍，園攻高唐，共軍軍長陳毅並拒絕與王耀武將軍會晤，還在企圖登陸靑島；豫鄂間的共軍，正分犯宜城新野湯陰武陵，並有一股圖竄老河口。粵漢路班車在長衡間出軌覆車於前，京滬路凱旋號早班車則出軌覆車於後，甚至共軍的游擊部隊，在江南京畿一帶活躍起來，一度曾竄近丹陽。這都可見共軍大規模的破壞騷擾，愈來愈緊，也愈迫愈近。好像非常悶熱的天氣，只待霹靂一聲，傾盆大雨也許頃刻就來！</p>
<p>好戰之徒，存心如此，儘管政府遷就忍讓，未必能滿其慾壑，儘管馬歇爾特使公平調處，也未必能得其尊重。在好戰之徒的心目中，他們何嘗有國家，有民族？他們在勝利以來的十個月中，對於談判的態度，始終是時輭時硬，若即若離，似斷似續；他們起初預定輭要輭到不解决，硬要硬到不破裂。總之，他們是居心要「拖」，拖到自以爲有利於己的時候，然後圖窮匕見，以一演「全武行」爲快事。</p>
<p>他們口頭唱民主，而其實最不相信民主；他們口頭唱和平，而其實最不歡喜和平；他們口頭唱統一，而其實最不願見中國的統一。在這樣口是心非的大前提下，好戰之徒以爲最有利於他們的辦法，是拖到可以打的時候就「打」，拖到暫時不好打的時候就「談」，於是「談談打打」就成了他們的秘訣，而誤盡了國家，害苦了人民的，也就是這個秘訣。</p>
<p>是非曲直是顯然的。老百姓只要想一想：抗戰初期共軍祇有四萬五千人，卅三年共軍却要求改編爲十六個師，去年開始談判時共軍復要求改編十六個軍即四十八個師，比當初增加十六倍，現在約計有八十萬人。共軍佔領區域，在日寇投降前爲七十四縣，至本年一月十三日再佔二百四十一縣，停止衝突令下以後又加佔廿二縣，已共佔三百三十七縣。單看這兩點事實，不說別的，擴軍奪地的究竟是誰，應該無所爭辯的了。老百姓大家切望縮編軍隊，盟邦也決心協助我們整編軍隊，好戰之徒却在招兵買馬。老百姓大家切望國家統一，和平建設，好戰之徒却在爭城奪地，殺人盈野。這明明是和老百姓敵對，明明是要丟國家的臉，要削弱國家的國際地位。</p>
<p>這些好戰者爲什麼這樣有恃無恐的禍國殃民？因爲中共有兩種武器在運用：一種是配合國際局勢的「反美」宣傳；一種是欺騙着短視人民的「反內戰」中號。有了「反美」的宣傳武器，中共可以嚇唬美國盟友，使他們不敢眞正公斷，使他們只好敷衍中共的好戰者而不能提及調處無效以後如何制裁。有了「反美」的宣傳武器，他們於得到「美共」援助之下，更可在美國國內造成一種種糢糊印象，彷彿中國人民眞正要「反美」，於是可以加緊鼓吹「美軍撒離中國」，便利他們將來的大打特打。有了「反內戰」的口號武器，中共可以躱在「反內戰」的盾牌後面，只許他們射擊國軍，不許國軍得以還手；換言之，中共用了這「反內戰」的口號，等於可使國軍先行自己繳械，然後聽憑他們來稱心如意的打。明明他們是挑釁打人，他們却先向鄰居街坊大喊不要打，這眞是絕頂聰明的作風。譬如劫盜入室，先已握了手槍，却喊鄰居街坊共同來阻止被刼者的開槍自衛，這是何等高明？居然也有自稱第三者，不問公道，不顧正義，只知從旁吶喊，「不要開槍」，却又不共同制止盜刦在這樣奇怪的局面下，中共的好戰者自然要有恃無恐的了。</p>
<p>有些鼓吹反美的人說，美國以前似乎在一面「加油」，一面「救火」，今後希望美國只救火，不加油。這句話，表面好像動聽之至。其實救火也要工具。沒有車子機件皮帶水龍頭等等，救火也等於白說。墨子非攻，熱心之至，但他有時也不免要幫助一個國家堅守城池，方可達到弭戰目的。我們難道可以一說墨子用工具去帮助守城，也是在加油而不是救火嗎？老實講吧，今天中共是存心取攻勢，政府却只在守，救火的人如不能幫助守的人遏止那攻的力，火是救不了的。我們很慚愧，中國國內的火，還要美國人來幫助救！但是我們應該更痛惡中國竟有這些存心放火的人！本報早就提醒大家，趕快撲滅火種，而今爲時更晚了。今天中國大局，已經不是星星之火，而近乎成了燎原之勢，趕緊救火，趕緊救火！萬不可等候燒光大吉！</p>
<p>古人說：「投鼠忌器」。大槪從前有意無意縱容中共，以致今日勢成燎原的人，都是抱着「投鼠忌器」的心理病。但是今天鼠固不投。器亦瀕毁。時乎時乎，千鈞一髮！好戰者已圖窮匕見，負國家大局之重任者，是否還想再拖？</p>

<h3>五外長接獲正式通知　我為歐和會召集國　由五強輪流担任主席　四外長會議週末結束</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎十日專電〕法外部本日通知我國錢泰太使，九日四外長議決和會主席，由中英美蘇法五國外長輪流担任。（按蘇處長莫洛托夫原欲拒我為和會邀請國，嗣經我政府據理力爭，暨各國與論之壓力，乃放棄其頑固態度，已見昨日本報倫敦廣播訊）</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕今晨法大使梅里露赴外交部謁見王部長，面議法國外長通知書，其內容聲明係以外長會議名義，召集巴黎和平會議，故此次會議之召集，須以五國外長全體會議之名義召集。王外長允於轉報政府後答覆。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：蘇聯外長英洛托夫發表對德政策之藍皮書後，四強外長今日下午四時再度舉行會議，予以討論，預料可圓滿解決。四強外長會議將於本週末結束，美國務卿見爾納斯與蘇外長莫洛托夫定星期六離此返國。</p>
<p>英洛托夫常說闡明對德政策</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十日電〕四國外長會議頃繼續開會，名就德國問題發表意見，法總理兼外長皮杜爾發表言云，四強對於澈底解除德國武裝，消滅納粹主義，發揚民主精神，賠償戰爭損害各項問題，均須城闕協議。此外提高德國煤斤生產，劃定德國西睡邊界有其必要。關於邊界問題，法國態度迄未變更。關於德國經濟統一一層，法國雖暫時同意，但關於德國若幹地區分離一事，法國原來態度亦無何項變動。</p>
<p>英外相貝文云，肅清納粹思想與根除普魯士軍國主義，均有其必要，美國所提廿五年計劃，足以完成上述目標，自可加以接受。貝文並謂長期佔領德國，雖屬必要，但四佔領區互相隔離，不相聞問，則有未可。</p>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納斯云，各國代表對於德國經濟統一，似已一致同意，此乃一年以前所決定之原則，但此日之德國仍復分為四個佔領區，是又南轅而北轍，茲提議設立特委會，負責研究德國問題，關於此點，英法兩國代表均表示同意，莫洛托夫則要求從長加以考慮。</p>
<p>蘇聯外長莫洛托夫云，法國欲為德國煤斤提高產量，可以接受，各國佔領區之組織須予改善，德國之武裝須澈底予解除，亦可同意。惟欲在經濟上毀滅德國，或使其成為農業國，影響所及足以威脅整個世界經濟，則非所宜。德國苟無魯爾區，即不成為獨立國家，在政治上，德國未便成為聯邦國，其領土若幹部份未經德國人民之同意，亦未可分割，似此魯爾區可由國際共當，但未可與德國分離。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社十日巴黎電〕莫洛托夫本日在四外長會議席上發表長篇演說，闡明對德政策。宣稱任何摧毀整個德國，使德國農業化，非蘇聯所能贊同。莫氏之言有曰，吾人討論德國命運問題及對德國和約問題，此其時矣。蘇聯政府一向認為對於此種問題，若以報復為念，殊屬下策。德國人民雖不能推卸德國之侵略責任，但希特勒的德國與德國人民不可認為一體，亦係事實。德軍侵入蘇聯結界，蘇聯人民遭受非常之不幸，吾人之損失不可估計，歐洲其他人民及非洲人民，亦因德國發動侵略，因而遭受重大之損失及痛苦。準此而論，德國之命運問題，不僅為德人所當關切，且亦為希望防止將來德國任何侵略之各國人民所關切，其理至為明顯。同時吾人毋忘德國曾利用其工業力量，構成國際經濟制度重要之一環，但另一方面帶有人亦不可忘却即因此種工業力量，使德國有發動侵略可能，凡此均為事實。此際余開始假定一種理論，即自歐洲國際經濟及秩序觀點，向德國進行殲滅，使不復成為國家，並率由摧毀其工業中心之方法，使德國成為農業國家，凡此均非正當。此種行動將損害歐洲經濟，並使國際經濟解體。德國將因此發生政治危險，如人身之惡疾逐漸蔓延，終於成為和平與安全之威脅。余相信即使吾人採納此項政策，歷史亦將強迫吾人於日後放棄之，蓋以此項政策為不顯實際及立場不正故也。故依本人所見，吾人之任務不在消滅德國，而在使其成為和平的與民主的國家，但當剝奪其一切經濟與軍事之可能性，以免養虎貽患，再度成為侵略國家云。</p>
<h3>蘇接收奧境德財產　英美聯合提抗議　援引兩項文件與蘇交涉</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕英外部今日申稱：英國已與美國克拉克將軍提出聯合抗議，反對蘇聯接收奧地利境內德人財產之計劃，此僅係初步之反應。英方對此將不致限於僅提抗議而已，惟將否在維也納採取下一步行動，或待四國外長會議討論奧地利問題後再定舉措一點，則尚未決定。但眾料貝文似將於今日直接向莫洛無托夫提及此事。英國今將援引兩項文件，一為一一九四三年一月六日由十六戰爭國所簽字之倫敦宣言，其內容規定各盟國，包括蘇聯在內，不能承認移運德軍佔領區內之財產為有效。其二為一九四三年十一月一日這莫斯科宣言，不承認德奧合併，並重申三國將促成奧地利獨立與復興之意向，再與蘇聯交涉。</p>
<p>艾克遜聲明</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕美代理國務卿艾克遜今日宣稱：美國對於蘇聯自奧國搬運所謂德國資產，碍難加以承認，除非此種舉動與美國政策符合。搬運是否合法，以是否係「強制轉移」為評判標準，所謂「強制轉移」，其意即為原屬奧國產業，後被德國強制奪取，此項產業仍應視為奧國資產，不能作為德國資產論，因之不能加以沒收。按奧東部工業設備價值美金二千二百萬元，連同蘇軍佔領區內其他「德國外資產」，曾被蘇軍接收。</p>
<p>奧當局表示</p>
<p>〔聯合社維也納十日電〕奧總理費格爾今日在議會特別會議宣稱，奧境內德人財產，祇有在一九三八年德國併奧以前所合法取得者，蘇聯及其他佔領國始有權要求加以沒收。據費氏稱，凡德人於一九三八年後以政治壓力巧取　　所得者，奧政府均拒絕承認其為德財產，費氏言畢，全院報以掌聲。</p>
<p>德人不撤退</p>
<p>〔路透社維也納十日電〕此聞可靠方面息：經英美之抗議後，蘇聯當局已允「延至假期以後」再撤退奧國蘇軍區內之德人。「假期」二字之意如何，尚不明暸，維也納蘇聯區內所設之德僑臨時安插所，已告解散。</p>
<h3>蘇土懸安未解決　土軍復員</h3>
<p>〔路透社伊斯丹埠十日電〕土耳其官方機關「鳥　斯報」暗示稱，土耳其陸軍在歐戰初所微業之戰時所到兵額，將　蘇工關係確切解決之後，始予復員，該報社評稱，吾人乃被迫留此準備，以保衛各人之自由，土耳其國家與政府引為不安者，乃懸而未決之韃鞜尼爾與柬境卡　　與阿達漢省之領土問題，蘇聯提出後，至今尚未加以解決。外患現仍存在，不能澻即復員，則曾引起巴爾幹國家之進攻土耳其。</p>

<p>〔路透社瑞典京城十日電〕瑞典各地天空，發現狀若流星之光，居民大惑驚異，按過去亦有此等異光發現，均是天空自然現象，此次之發現尚未有解釋。</p>
<h3>荷政府將派代表團參加爪哇談判　覓取和平解決方案</h3>
<p>〔路透社海牙十日電〕荷蘭總理比無頃向下院透露：荷政府將派代表團赴爪，參加范莫克與印尼之談判。談判目的乃在覓取印尼衝突之和平解決方案，並促印尼人民參加將在海牙舉行之會議。眾料前總理施默霍恩將率政府代表團赴印度尼西亞。</p>
<p>沙利總理兼任外長</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十日電〕印尼問題沙利宣佈，渠已被任為新閣外長，沙利繼謂：爪哇內地之軍事行動進行順利，其目的為肅清革命運動份子，及組織新閣之較佳環境。</p>
<p>陰謀分子全部肅清</p>
<p>上週約茄卡達急進份子所發動之陰謀，「類頗似墨西哥之政變」，當余到達總統蘇下諾官邸時，有一陰謀領袖正向蘇下諾宣讀最後通牒，要求設立「政治局」，其權威高於內閣，當時各陰謀者即為總統之敢衛隊解除武裝，加以逮捕，現將設立特別法庭，以國事犯加以審刑。</p>
<h3>聯合國原子能委會程序規章通過　加拿大代表獲准參加討論　蘇代表再運用否決權失敗</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十日電〕聯合國安理會本日一致通過原子能委會所草擬之程序規章，俾便該委會於討論原子能管制計劃時有所遵循。安理會對於加拿大代表之出席問題展開激辨，結果以九對一票准許加拿大代表參加。蘇聯投反對票。加拿大並非理事會之正常會員，但加拿大既係原子能委會會員，故特請求被准許參加原子能問題之討論，蘇代表葛羅米柯反對加拿大之請求，其理由為此舉屬於新步驟，主張援議。英澳代表認為加拿大之請求極為合理，因任何國家，若所討論者涉及該國，均可不經投票手續而參加理事會之討論。關於此點，聯合國憲章，已有明文規定。至此，主席納傑里（墨西哥代表）乃採取投票方式決定，遂獲九對一結果，波蘭不參加投票，於是蘇聯代表全圖運用否決權，但為主席所拒絕。納氏指出本問題係「程序」而並非「實質」，不能運用否決權。因此，加代表乃繼續安坐席上，旋即休會，定十七日再開，改由荷代表克萊芬任主席。</p>
<h3>白朗第預測</h3>

<h3>尼赫魯演說</h3>
<p>〔路透社孟買十日電〕印度國大黨新會長尼赫魯，今日在此間廿萬人之露天集會中發表演說稱：國大會黨徜不獲制定印度　眾完全自由與主權之憲法，則印度人將準備在炮彈與刺刀之下，向英人爭還自由。該項憲法當由制憲會議加以制定。尼赫魯並促人民倘在無辦法之時，應準備聯合作戰，吾人建立自由印度，不容存在種族歧視，白人可許其居留印度，惟需尊重印度人云。</p>

<p>所犯罪行，一味狡賴，矢口否認。昨日下午再審時，仍裝聾作啞，否認「黃道會」會長，及有殺人之事。派人官當告以二十七年各報都有記載，常竟狡辯稱：因民國十六年梅蘭芳唱戲時我招待不週，得罪報界，故新聞界都對我仇恨。新聞記者沒有材料，才找到我頭上來。並稱：我是一個好佛的人，不識一個這了，從民國元年至今，煙酒不吃，連雞都不殺一只，怎會殺人。他們與我無怨無仇，我又不是發了神經病，才要去殺他們？殺人放火要有確實證據，叫人到庭來證明才是。依靠報紙記載不正確，因為報紙曾說我死了。但我現在仍活著。你（指法官）要逼我承認殺人，當時我是做了官？還是發了財？因常逆之一口否認，故法官為之奈何不得，一再訊問，常乃略言，「黃道會」由陳群主持，會長是日人高橋。但對手下有多少徒弟，　造恐怖案件等事，仍堅不吐實。最後庭上自獄中提出被判徒刑二年半之前公共租界巡捕房華探長黃福森詢問。黃稱二十七年租界之恐怖案多由「黃道會」所幹，但對會長是否常玉清一事，則稱係聽說，實情不知。該案尚須開庭調查，乃諭改期再訊。</p>
<h3>蔡培再度受審　出任偽職謂係救民</h3>
<p>曾任偽駐日大使，偽南京市長之蔡培，昨日再度在高院受審。蔡對當時在敵偽報紙所發表之媚敵言論辯稱當時一切報紙刊物皆受敵偽統制，常有假借名義隨意增減之事發生。而偽宣傳部之冒名撰文為其慣技。在當時惡劣環境下，實無法更正。名字不能放在自己袋裏，禁止別人應用，此點請庭上明察。於為南京市長任內，曾向駐紮中山陵之日軍交涉撤退，事後加以整理，並組織警衛隊保護。歷代對保護陵墓之人皆有大功，此為我效忠總理最大之事。而我於偽職任內，曾與中央軍令部東南區特派員徐明誠聯絡，供給情報。並曾營救被捕之地下工作人員南京市黨部主任委員馬元放，青年團上海支團部總務組長俞鴻　，三戰區第二遊擊區總指揮部賬務處同志王文俊等。故我之任偽職，係因當時惡劣環境之逼迫，而在任時，不為名亦不為利，而為救民，請庭上原諒雲。並由鄧潔存，俞龐容，王文俊等到庭作有利證明，蔡又延俞存修律師辯護，該案稱辯論終結，定十八日上午九時半宣判。</p>

<h3>資源會吳主任秘書　來滬視察各機構　詳談臺糖公司成立經過　希望糖商合作穩定市價</h3>
<p>經濟部資源委員會主任秘書吳兆洪氏，前日由京來滬，視察上海所屬機構，並調查市情，向中樞報告。中央社記者以最近食糖上漲，曾引起一般人士注意，甚有對臺灣糖業公司處理工作，紛紛資難者，按該公司係資源委會直屬機構，吳氏之恰蒞上海，記者特就臺糖範圍，向吳氏徵詢意見，承告各點如下：「資滬委員會經辦團營工礦事業，向來重視人民利益，對民間所辦同類事業，亦採取協助態度，俾使國營民營事業，得以攜手並進，以促進國家整個工業之發展，臺灣糖業，經日人數十年之經營，規模可稱宏大，不僅自糖廠，並有廠建鐵路二千餘公裏，及大量蔗田，但在</p>
<p>戰事期內受盟機轟炸，損害甚巨，故恢復及經營此項事業，實為一艱巨之工作。本年在四月間，奉行政院令，交由資委會接辦，並經奉准與臺灣省行政長官公署合辦，因原有事業內，有少數臺胞投資，故組織股份有限公司。我國戰前國內糖廠甚少，大部份食糖，均自海外輸入，每年耗用外匯為數不貲，是以糖公司最要目標，為謀恢復以往產量，藉以供應國內需要。故於本年五月接辦以後，即開始整理廠房及機器設備，並聘定美國製糖專家，前往實地視察，會同我方技術人員，擬定</p>
<p>恢復計劃現美方初步報告，業已提出，需向國外補充大量器材，始能逐漸恢復舊觀。又各廠原料有存糖，經奉院令由公司出售，此項售價，依照敵偽產業處理辦法，公司除少數雜費用外，餘款悉數解繳國庫。至公司售糖方針，在開始之時，即出資委會確定，除大量用戶直接售給外，祇做　售業務，不賣零售，　時在此各種物價騰漲之　，資委會對平抑物價一點，亦自始注意，故規定公司批發價格，必須低於市價。該以司自五月廿四日開始售糖以後，每次售價，均低於市價，各報記錄，可以覆按。但如市價為</p>
<p>市場抬高較批發價格甚多時，公司自無仍照原價出售之理。資源會經營事業，原非以營利為目的，但如公司仍照原價出售，一方面政府減少收入，遭受不必要之損失，而對於一般人民，並無好處，是徒使少數商人獲得過分之利益。故由會飭知糖業公司，今後定價，仍應保持低於市價政策，而對正當糖商之合理利益，自應予以維護，切盼糖商亦能以愛護國產糖業之立場，穩定市場價格，以嘉惠一般市民雲。</p>
<p>又吳氏昨親赴臺灣糖業公司視察，對最近該以司營業狀況，配售經過，垂詢甚詳，後偕前日由臺返滬之該以司總經理沈鎮南，協理宋以售拜訪吳市長，對將來如何抑止糖價漲風，改善配售，以期普及用戶，祛除不法商人操縱諸問題，均有所討論。吳氏已於昨夜晚車偕沈乘車返京。可能兩週後再度來申。</p>

<h3>平劇界新聞人物　馬連良的「解釋」　否認到東北演戲是奉派慶祝　對法院通緝和封屋表示懷疑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕晚上九時半，至皇后大戲院後臺雲訪馬連良，回說是「馬老　還沒有來。」十時半，回說是「馬老　在上戲。」門口管得很嚴，本來不放記者進雲，終於放進雲了。馬連良穿著戲裝，在布景後對記者說：「請您等在皇后咖啡館，我下了戲凖來。」</p>
<p>十一時半，我在皇后咖啡館樓上正式會見了這最近轟動上海的新聞人物，一個名伶。各報上都登過馬連良會附逆被檢舉被北平高等法院下令　捕的新聞，現在他是一般市民談話的中心，可是他還是在泰然的唱義務戲。</p>
<p>「我希望報界朋友們能明瞭我的事情，能給我一個公正的批評，」馬連良非常謙虛的說。「我不是說我是冤枉的，不過我要將我過去在偽滿演戲的事情解釋一下。」</p>
<p>他把他的精神集中在這件「解釋」上。他說了許多話，據他的意思，他到偽滿去演戲，還是一椿義舉。馬連良是一個回教徒，瀋陽地方有一所回教協會設立的東北回教中學，因為經費不夠，約馬去義務滋演唱幾天募錢。「可是事情的要點不在這上面，」馬連良急切的說，「偽滿有一個日本浪人　島等所組織的演藝協會，他們以這組織來　制東　的遊藝界，其中有一個中辦為他們當翻譯，　人說是北平三六九畫報主編朱復昌。由宋代表演藝協會來和我接洽，說要接我到瀋陽去演戲，回教協會請我去演戲的事，也由他們包辦。演藝協會的組織，主要是為金錢，他們以日本人的特殊勢力來「保護」到東北去的藝人，從我們的包銀中抽利。朱復昌又用死亡來威協我，結果，」馬老　　歎說，「我去了。」</p>
<p>結果他去了。他在瀋陽為回教協會演義務戲十二天，然後又作營業性的演出二十餘天，這二十餘天是為「演藝協會」要取利而演的。馬連良說得很可憫，好像他在東北演戲，完全是不得已的。這時他又搬些舊事，說起抗戰前偽冀東政府成立時，裝瘋逃演的事，又說勝利後歡迎蔣主席及各長官的慶祝戲，都是他辦辦。他是不是想表些功勞呢？一個真正附逆（假定他是）的人是不是因這些功勞可卸罪呢？</p>
<p>最後，記者問他最重要的問題：對於這次北平高等法院下令拘捕他的事情，他覺得怎樣？</p>
<p>「我沒有什麼好說，」他激動的說，「不過我不相信那只消息是正確的。他們說要逮捕我，我至今沒有接到公事。他們說我北平的房子被查封，我至今沒有接到家裏的電報。什麼事情，我都不知，所以我照樣安心唱義務戲，如果上面有命令來要我去，我一定到。」</p>
<p>他並且說：「我要特別聲明，我到東北去演戲，不是偽政府派去慶祝他們所謂建國十週紀念的。我不過是剛趕得巧。如果真的是偽府派去，那末偽府有底案可查，我決不推諉。」</p>
<p>他說的很硬，好像他是完全清白的，不過是非究竟如何，那不是記者的事了。和他分別時已是深夜，　上有多少的人們在這　靜深夜裏，思索他們白天所作的好惡的！</p>

<h3>西康中等教育概況　全省五區有中學廿三所</h3>
<p>〔本報西昌專訊〕西康位處邊陲，文化閉塞，自廿七年建省後，遂引起主政者之注意，而中學之設立，亦似雨後春筍，原先該省分爲四中學區，現則分成五中學區，每區至少設立省中一所，縣中一所。茲將各區中學情形略誌於後：</p>
<p>第一區包括舊康屬之二十一縣局。該區內，現有省立康定中學，及瀘定中學，與瀘定縣立初中二所，除康中外，其餘二校之班次，均不完全。</p>
<p>第二區包括雅安，天全，榮經，蘆山，寶興，五縣，現有省立雅安中學，雅安女中，及縣立中學等八所，其中以省立雅中較爲完善，其餘各校之班次，則亦零落不全。</p>
<p>第三區包括漢源，越雋，冕寗三縣，現有漢源縣中，越雋縣中，漢源私立裕文初級中學，及冕寗縣立初級中學等四所，除漢源縣中有高中三班，男女合班，及初中男女分班三班外，其餘各校均男女合班。</p>
<p>第四區包括西昌，鹽源，德昌，昭覺，寗東等五縣局，其中以西昌之中學爲多，計有省立西昌中學，縣立中學，縣立女中，縣立禮州初中等數校。各縣局設有德昌縣立初中，鹽源縣立初中，及西昌私立健生初中。省立西中，係舊寗遠府中學堂改組，規模較大，設備較佳，現有高中三班，男女合班，初中六班。縣立西中之班次亦同。其餘各校，或係初創，或因人數稀少，無甚成績可言。</p>
<p>第五區包括會理，鹽邊，寗南三縣。除會理設有縣立中學，有高初中各三班外，餘二縣僅各設初級中學一所，班次不全。總計全省五區，有中學二十三所，內省立中學四所，縣立中學五所，縣立初中十所，私立初中四所，其中除一二校成立較久外，餘均於抗戰期中所設立，故設備，師資等，均受戰時影響，因陋就簡，圖書，儀器，教員經費，在在寡陋，教學效率因之減弱，學生程度於以之低落，實爲康省中等教育之極大缺陷。現該省有識之士，紛謀改革之道，綜其要者，有下列各點：（一）充實設備，（二）調整學區，（三）提高程度，（四）加強管理，（五）嚴選師資。（緘）</p>

<h3>搶修蘊藻浜大橋</h3>
<p>本市第二十三區（吳淞）境內蘊藻浜大橋，爲吳淞上海間交通孔道，久年失修，破壞不堪。勝利後經該區區公所會同日俘管理所略加修理，僅堪使用。近以淞滬鐵路尚未接通汽車，運輸頻繁，致橋面洞穿多處，將有傾圯之虞。吳淞要塞司令部及該區區公所，有鑒於此，爰於本月八日，假永安紗廠，召開搶修該橋緊急會議。到有吳淞各軍政警機關，及工廠商行等，公和二十餘團體發起組織蘊藻浜橋搶修委員會，即於近日動工，本月底可完成。</p>

<h3>僑滙顯有進步　南洋方面尙受限制　歐洲大陸亦難直接通滙</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勝利後，國外各地僑匯，紛紛恢復，惟在今年三月四日以前，因匯率過低，頗受影饗，及至三月四日重新訂定新匯率後，僑胞匯款回國數目漸增，而中國銀行在國外南洋等地分行，亦逐次復業，僑胞匯款回國，便利多多，且最近國際匯兌亦已開放，不再由中國銀行專業，凡經指定之中外銀行，均可經辦，是項指定銀行計有匯豐，廣東，華僑，聚興誠等卅餘家。近月以來華僑匯款回國之數目，以來自美國者爲最鉅，南洋次之。僅以中國銀行一家計，近月來每月所收國外僑咆匯款超出法幣五十萬元以上，不過，此項數目雖遠勝戰前，而幣値則絕非戰前可比。故目前僑匯較諸戰前，實際並無進步。</p>
<p>關於南洋各地僑匯情形，因英屬地區如馬來半島，仍在統制之下，匯款備受限制，數目甚屬有限。至於荷屬東印度因秩序尙未完全恢復，我方國家銀行在該地分行亦未復業，目前陷於停滯狀態。緬甸則亦在英方統制之下，僑匯受限制。暹羅方面匯款向由越南海防轉匯，但不久中國銀行或將在該地設立分行。同時，戰爭時期，緬甸及南洋僑胞有因不甘日方壓迫撤退返國者，現欲返回原地區，仍受英方之入境限制，多數仍滯留本國。此亦爲南洋僑匯減少之原回，菲律賓方面情形較好，僑匯暢通。</p>
<p>在歐洲，中國銀行設分行於倫敦，其他地區匯款均由倫敦轉達。德國尙在盟方共管時期，僑匯自無從談起，法國則法郎行情變異甚劇，直接匯款至中國頗有困難，且在歐洲大陸我國僑胞爲數甚少，經商者尤少，國家銀行目前無意在歐再設分行。事實上，歐陸等地僑胞如需匯款回國，可與當地領事館設法辦理或交倫教中行分行經辦。　另據銀行界息：廣州失陷時某國家銀行收受國外僑匯之賬册不幸遺落若干匯款無從查考。至此一問題今仍爲僑匯的一個懸案。</p>
<h3>公債又告回落</h3>
<p>公債高後漸感虛空，前日力進之五樓某大戶，有所覆出，統丙晨開後，自一二〇〇外逐步盤跌至八五〇元左右，潮帮購納少許，午刻復迫近一千元大關，結果較前收回跌一二〇元，甲乙亦小五十元，丁種降九十元，戊種起仆至速，回跌達二二〇元。</p>
<h3>粵幫採辦沙價轉高　美棉飛漲本埠現棉交易暢盛</h3>
<p>昨日紗市已臻穩局，觀望數日之粵帮，已漸下手採辦，由申新三廠供售廿支特好，做五六百件，價開一百十五萬元，二禮拜內派現，又安達紗廠開出特飛虎，價一百廿二萬，其餘各大型廠均有拋出，綜觀全日所成交易，較上日好起二三萬之譜，收市時似露鋒芒，然尙待實銷來扶持也。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊再飛漲九十八至一百磅音，計近期美金三三·五三，遠期三三·七六，米特林現貨三四·一九，空前新高似，本埠現棉交易暢盛，市價愈俏俐，紡建公司曾辦進米特林一牌三千六百包，此外新裕振新嘉　等廠亦各有三四百包購進。</p>
<h3>華股昨永紗獨俏　外股求過於供一致上漲</h3>
<p>華股有某實業公司力購永紗五十萬股，大股突呈鋒俏，小股僅居被動地位，帶好而已，全日晨初最低，午刻最高，中途大股穩健，小股以上市問題，預測希望較少，問津無人，爲狀飄忽，各老股仍無法進步，結果較前收計永紗漲三十二元，美亞升一七〇元，景福新光勤興各升半成，冷門中小型均稍回漲，惟元老股則不進反退。</p>
<p>外股昨求過於供，急切反動，怡紗晨開即升至七二〇〇元，開後買風有增無减，逐漸盤好至八千五光景而後轉入盤境，其他各股亦被帶上，結果較前收計怡紗英聯回升二成，會德豐怡啤鋼業亞洲業廣紙業各漲一成至一成半不等。</p>
<h3>中砂白續跌</h3>
<p>已較公司開價爲低</p>
<p>昨糖市以實銷依然不暢，趨勢續軟，公司劃盤現貨二十號中砂白初劃十萬元，旋降九萬八千元至六千元，最低爲九萬三千元，後略回好，由五千元至七千元，比前日降五六千元，棧單初劃即降四千元，爲九萬四千元，最低曾破九萬大關而至八萬九千元，後微升爲九萬至九萬〇五百元，前後降去七千餘元，號貨仍僅另星成交，而價格續見下游，與化帮開出赤糖二三十包，十萬〇四千元至二千元，汕頭帮開黃崗靑四五十包，八萬至七萬九千元，又普通棉赤三十餘包，十萬〇五千云。</p>
<h3>到船擁擠結款多　美鈔堅定港票漲　金價平穩微挫五千</h3>
<p>烚赤昨極平穩，中央配給時，微見盤小，然以美鈔形勢較挺，買氣仍盛，查晨開平穩，開後自一九五萬逐漸見低，十時後中央配給五五條，價一九三萬七五，此後曾盤小至一九三萬，無何美鈔買風又起，午刻復回升一九五萬以上，午後爲狀平和，起仆殊微，結果較前收微挫五千，銀樓飾金念萬〇八，紋銀一千八，暗拆銀根鬆濫，息價一角半至一角八。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔初平繼俏，到船擁擠，結款浩大，上塲時在二五五〇元左右盤旋，十時後形勢又緊，午刻曾盤好至二六二〇元而後微回，午後結款略止，形勢漸定，結果較之前日無甚相差，港票形勢俏利，結果續升五元，港匯五四〇元左右，印匯六六〇元有售，英匯八千六至八千八，成交幷未見多，美匯掛牌仍平，對做仍呆。</p>
<h3>米市動態逐漸好轉</h3>
<p>平米今日可有二百餘家米號發售</p>
<p>本市白米價格審議委員會自開始審定各種米糧價格後，停頓多時之南北米市場交易，已漸恢復常態，昨晨各產地亦有到貨，數達四千餘石，市區各米號已有標價米糧應市。</p>
<p>當局規定憑戶牌購買低價米辦法，原定昨日普遍開始，惟以出貨手續關係，準於今日上午全市各區米號可有十分之一以上發售，按本市現有米號約二千餘家，經售低價米號首期可核定二百餘家。麵粉供求頗多，價形平正，油價以連日下降之後，店胃轉殷，疲而復升千餘元，黃豆平定，紅糧竟少受主，芝蔴消塲活潑，價漲一二千元，麩皮胃呆，下挫百元，豆餅肥田去路蟬聯，上升二三百元，小麥廣帮揀選高貨，動而不旺，中下仍然呆滯，廠方因粉市不振，進胃亦不濃。</p>
<h3>漢口證券業　着手組織公會</h3>
<p>登記會員共一二七家</p>
<p>漢市證劵公會，勝利後曾圖恢復，惟因債劵戰後市價與票面相差甚距，復以市場暗拆過高，漢市債劵流通數量亦較滬爲少，以致未能實現，最近因政府宣佈統一公債還本付息，持券人紛紛託售，流通籌碼激增，經營此業人士咸感正式交易市塲有積極籌設之必要，正着手組織公會，已經登記會員共一二七家，預計正式成立日期約在八月下旬。</p>
<h3>銀行繳存準備金　財部可疑允許酌減　授權中央銀行決定</h3>
<p>商業銀行吸收活期定期存款，須向中央銀行提繳準備金一事，津滬平渝等地銀行公會以此項辦法，殊足影響資金之流動，曾先後表示意見，據悉政府方面爲體念商艱起見，對於提繳準備金額可能予以變通，活期者原定提存百分之廿，可能減至百分之十五，定期者原定提存百分之十五，亦可能減爲百分之七，業山財部授權央銀行酌加决定云。</p>
<h3>美國絲價下跌　影響華絲外銷</h3>
<p>自美國市塲報吿美國內絲價將自每磅九元，降至每磅六元之消息傳出後，業已引起各地絲商之深切不安，據中蠶公司總經理葛敬中氏云，今年中國絲產量僅及戰前十分之一，右有一萬二千包運美，每磅以九元（美金）計算，則僅能收回外匯一千數百萬，且目前美國生絲價値將有降低說，如此則更不堪設想，又該公司目前曾有生絲二百包運美，均係按照九元一磅價計算，然按照匯率計算，每磅虧蝕達三分之一以上，若美國生絲價格自每磅九元降至六元，國內絲商皆裹足不前，生絲出口實堪憂慮，故希望政府能早日調整關稅，以挽絲業于絕境云。</p>
<h3>夏令呢絨慘跌</h3>
<p>夏令呢絨，時至今日，可謂完全落令，祗門莊尙餘些微銷路，總觀今夏各檔應時貨，如派力司凡而頂羽紗呢等，其瘋狂暴漲，眞出人意料之外，至今秋冬貨價獨受其影響，現在時過境遷，買方一無問津，套牢者雖欲斬售，亦乏受主，白直貢白　嘰類慘跌尤甚，眞蔴膠布與臘綫藏膠布雖係本廠製造，亦莫不一落千丈，雖受銷日已過關係然亦爲人心轉移遠較往年爲劇耳，螺四呢與扳四呢，因初秋尙可短期行銷，故下跌較爲輕微，法蘭羢因寒暑俱有走銷，僅顏色深淡，互有轉變，故尙能保持現狀，巴勒呢胖嗶嘰之銷塲遠不若派力斯凡而頂羽紗呢之繁，致其趨勢亦較上開各貨更爲疲弱，雪克斯頂今夏需供兩寂，早已消聲匿跡，美式斜紋布料已成普銷之繁貨，所跌無幾</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>茶葉　洋莊茶市，邇來英商協和洋行及注裕泰茶號對祁門陳紅茶，頻有騐看還盤，惟價格方面，上品貨每担僅出八萬餘元，是以僵局不易攻破，至于本街店莊蘇錫等地，鑒于銷路尙佳，因此仍有問訊，行情大勢堅平。</p>
<p>五金　木羅絲繼續步升，門鎖廠盤高於市面，以去路不廣，暫售原價，刀牌三角銼首批到貨因爲數不多，業已售罄，現喊價漲起一二成不等，羅絲公GTD有到，價格較OK尤康，管十小花色仍堅昂，大花色稱微向上，鋼板無甚起落。</p>
<p>海味　受銀根影響，交易淸淡，時逢炎夏，銷路减色，蝦尾海蜒生粉木耳湘運由穩轉疲，洋菜其菜西谷米均見下挫，魷魚花旗參生開肚禿參海帶亦難立足，惟香菇到稀消減，秀象畢露，其他各貨均屬平　。</p>
<p>木材　昨日木材市况，略爲轉好，買方稍有購進，去路活絡，行情盤升。</p>
<h3>世界存金　共三萬四千噸　美國佔有三分之二以上</h3>
<p>當今黃金爲人視，據美國聯邦準備銀行管理處估計，全世界共有黃金約二百九十億零八千萬美元，按美元法定含金成分十五又二十一分之五格蘭折算，全球各國，共有黃金約三萬四千二百零二噸半，美國在太平洋事變前，握全球黃金百分之八十强，現仍握有百分之六十九（即二萬三千五百九十九噸强），在歐戰初期，歐洲黃金多流入美國，太平洋事變後，美國因向中美及南美諸邦採購戰時原料，以黃金支付，故美國存金略减，南美中美諸邦存余激增，茲將本年一月底止，各國所握黃金列表如后：（單位百萬美元）</p>
<p>美國　二〇·一五六　南非　九四九</p>
<p>法國　一·五七六　印度　二七四</p>
<p>瑞士　一·〇九九　土耳其　二四一</p>

<h3>我空軍第八大隊　東京行</h3>
<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>我機以一百六十海里空速前進</p>
<p>我們的飛機一昇空，就進入雲中。我們都　着一二　　孔里落下來的雨點，　　艙里兩王，在徐　林機務長協助下　　了各項　　，向七十八度方面飛。同時，提昇飛機的高度，我看看玻窗外的景象，到處是白雲，可是飛機的　　發動機，　　　在目，就憑　機　上一　兩個發動機的馬力，　　　　　　　　，　　　以一百六十海里空速前進。</p>
<p>B21飛機是美國在這次大戰中使用最多的飛機，尤其在歐洲戰　，以英倫為基地，炸毀德軍前綫與後方的　主要就是　　銀白色　尾舵四發動機　　機。不僅美國空軍使用牠，美國、加拿大、蘇聯，都通　租借法案把　借　　。我們中國方面，第一架B24人境，是威爾基氏訪問中國時　蘇聯飛來的，不久，陳納德第十四航空隊曾使用她從昆明基地去炸　南河內海防等日軍基地，到後來，炸香港，炸武漢，B24也　與其役。解放式　　的身影從此威臨海內外。可是欲用來在太平洋方面炸日本本土，這九小時航程的飛機還不能勝任，所以　國人特地又　造了B2　十六小時航程的超　堡壘，來施行遠距　轟炸，從此，日本本土就陷於瓦解。逐鳥進攻，獲得了小笠原　島，　　島，以及大琉球島以後B24機的威力也可以及於日本本土，於是　　白色姑娘也就不時光臨風光綺麗的日本三島。空軍第八大隊，怱怱由美國訓練完成，趕回遠東，在印度待命的時候，就有進駐大琉球島參與美軍炸日本的最後　擊。可是，不待大貪污地，日本就完啦！這自然使這個大隊失望。生活旣已入於和平時代，可是担任國防重任的軍隊，依然得警戒在第一綫，且　　愁他的境界內一切實況。第八大隊因是奉命經常去做以上海為中心的熟悉航行，以保持飛行水凖於不　。</p>
<p>當王世　大隊長在駕駛艙里抽上一支香煙時，我們嗅到煙的香味，　這飛機雖在雲中盲目飛行，（天地境界都看不到，主　駕駛艙食品指導航行，謂之盲目飛行，但今日美國則稱為儀器航行。）緊張與怱忙的第一階段已過，我們飛機已入於安定的持續航行狀態。等到王國南上尉也抽起香煙時，我們這個　綫電艙也就傳染上抽煙的行為，陳功　　上套　耳　，眼注視　　上發報機，及記錄本，也抽煙，徐書跑林前跑後，上上下下去弄各種機械開關，也抽煙，我們這幾個人也就抽煙吃糖。朱世明團長什麼也不吃，只吞下了一個小銅盒內的白色小藥片。</p>
<p>在抽煙的悠閑狀態裏，徐書林　首先告訴我：一只三十噸　的大飛機，能在不見天地的雲中飛得平衡而不華僑，除了　羅　與水平儀以外，還有一排六粒奶黃色顯示燈在不斷以閃光提醒駕駛員。這六粒小枇杷那麼小的電燈，其中左邊平行四粒，第一粒是左　傾側報吿燈，第二粒是右　，第三粒是向左面偏轉報吿燈，第四粒是向右偏轉報告燈，右邊上下兩粒小燈，上燈如閃光，是報告機頭，向上，下燈要閃光，是機尾向上。憑着這六粒小黃燈的閃光，駕　員做着柔和的輕慢的小動作，調整飛機，使它永遠在長距離的平飛狀態中行進。</p>
<p>十一點鐘，天界可以看到，王世　抬頭看一看天上雲層之後，說：</p>
<p>「今天海上是三層雲。」</p>
<p>王國南點了點頭，說：</p>
<p>「江灣不叫起飛的」。</p>
<p>飛行員做事，就愛遵守命令的時間，二十日起飛的時間是王世　自己下的，到時候，他自己服從命令，而不以海上氣候惡劣延期，不過美國基地提供了一項良好的預測，就是目標地東京，上午雖然落雨，漫天風雲，如同上海，但下午飛機到達的時候，天氣可以轉晴，雲散雨止，地面開朗，不致有雲封富士山，讓飛機碰到這個大雪帽上去。根據這一點預報，王國南上尉填　了飛行表，美國人也就趕忙拍電到日本美軍電臺，預告中國一架B-24機已起飛，飛上十八度，向日本航行，并囑飛機在途中近日本本土時要與日本美軍電臺聯絡。</p>
<h3>不會迷路的領航員</h3>
<p>十一點，改飛八十三度，這是領航員黃爾毅計算的方向。黃爾毅這時已　進入駕駛艙下前方的領航員艙內，他一個人孤獨的在地　，時間，羅盤上做功夫。最後，他告訴駕駛員於十一點　改飛十三度（比原來航向略偏南一點。）黃爾毅是上海人，在美國二年，學會了領航B-24向任何地區航行的計算能力，如同海船上的引水人或航海長一般不會迷路的。</p>
<p>十二點鐘，我們看到海洋境界，飛機在九千尺下面是白雲，淡薄的　絲，遮蓋在淡灰藍色的海面上。這　地，使　次看到的人以為是　暮天宇倒轉在　機下面去了，可是飛機是在飛而不是倒飛呀。那灰藍色的當然是海，（由此，我得一印象，海在某一時間塗上雲的反光是灰藍色而不是碧錄色。　　懋忽然把耳機取下，以憂容說：「東京在下雨」。</p>
<p>我知道，這消息相當嚴重，所以產生了他的憂容，但他旋則補充：「下午三點可以轉晴。那正是我們到東京的時間。　這自然使我們放心。</p>
<p>飛機又入於雲團中，與雲或碰或避，機身在上下左右動蕩。我担心四位中國代表團女打字員要嘔吐，幸而他們都如常。我問她們飛行次數，其中二位是第一次，一位是第二次，一位像日本女郞的白楊小姐，他已飛行十六次。昆明重慶都到過，早先為美軍做打字員的，她自稱為老飛行客，引得我們大笑起來。</p>
<p>十二點三十五分，徐　林告訴我：日本本土在下面了。他指指下面，指指窗戶，綠色的樹林與黃色的土地相間雜，黃色的道路像一根不規則的遺落地上的衣帶，九州地方從外表說是一個農林漁區，只看　路不寬，鐵路不多，即可如此論斷，但實際上，他擁有有名的小　八　　礦區域鐵路綫也通遍任何地點，從外表匆匆一瞥，不能把內容看淸楚，那如同看一個人外貌不能知其內心一般。在九州北角掠過，飛機向四國與本州之間的日本同化學系　上空航進。一點十分，朱匯明團長從駕駛艙下來，說：「飛機正向大阪飛」！徐書林預告：「二點五分可以到大阪」。（未完）</p>

<h3>夏令腹瀉</h3>
<p>— 林兆耆</p>
<p>正名</p>
<p>夏令腹瀉這個名稱雖然通俗，意義卻很含糊，第一，它並不專指某一種疾病，而是概指病原（即病菌）不同的各種腹瀉症。第二，腹瀉症並不限於夏季，秋季也有發生，而少數的腹瀉病例是常年都有的。</p>
<p>除了夏令腹瀉這個名稱以外，還有一個名稱是一般人時常用來指急性細菌性腹瀉的，就是所謂「食物中毒」。不過「食物中毒」這個名稱也太嫌廣泛，而且容易引起誤會，因為卽稱食物中毒，便要使人想到食物本身有毒，這在河豚中毒，毒蕈中毒等事件上固然不錯，可是在急性細菌性腹瀉，食物本身並無毒質，不過食物上面沾染了病菌，以致人們吃了腹瀉；若以「食物中毒」四字來指腹瀉，便要使人誤會，以為腹瀉的原因是在食物本身而不在病菌了。</p>
<p>從上面所說的看來，「夏令腹瀉」和「食物中毒」兩個名稱都不恰當。假定我們要找一個比較妥切的名稱，那末我們不妨稱之為「急性細菌性腹瀉」，不過這還是一個攏統的名稱；若就疾病侵襲人體部份而言，我們可以用「急性細菌性結腸炎」，和「急性細菌性小腸結腸炎」等名稱；若要表示某種腹瀉係由某種細菌所致，那末就得把那種細菌的名稱標出。</p>
<p>病原</p>
<p>一切急性細菌性腹瀉都是由於吃了沾染有細菌或病菌素的食物而起的。引起腹瀉的病菌種類（一）沙門氏菌屬，其中尤以豬霍亂桿菌，腸炎桿菌，亞替氏桿菌，甲種副傷寒桿菌和乙種副傷寒桿菌為最；（二）赤痢桿菌；（三）葡萄球菌毒素；（四）此外有幾種微生物本身並無害處，例如大腸桿菌，變形桿菌，直腸桿菌，乳鏈球菌，草綠色鏈球菌等，不過於優良環境（對細菌而言）之下，在某些食物裏面繁殖起來，能夠產生素質，人們吃了這種食物以後，胃腸裏面會感到不適。在這四類病菌中，要推沙門氏菌屬為急性細菌性腹瀉最大來源；沙門氏桿菌最易繁殖於豬肉·牛奶·魚·蛋等裏面，而在蔬菜·穀類和鮮果裏面較難生長。不潔肉類，其來源不外二種，一種是瘟豬瘟牛，——豬牛和人類一樣，也能受沙門氏菌屬的侵襲而患胃腸系疾病和其他病症，人們吃了瘟豬瘟牛的肉以後，便受傳染而致腹瀉；還有一種來源是健康的牲畜，不過那牲畜在宰割煮醃的時候染到病菌，這也足以使人吃了腹瀉。母牛乳房上面有了病菌，那末擠出來的牛乳也不免沾染病菌；此外，牛糞內含有病菌而使牛乳沾染病菌，也是常有的事情。近年以來，對於蛋類傳播疾病，頗有人加以研究，而據研究結果，認為未煮熟的鴨蛋，比較雞蛋鴿蛋更易傳染疾病，原來鴨子很容易患腸炎，而那些鴨蛋在母體內已經染到病菌了。</p>
<p>葡萄球菌毒素所引起的急性細菌性腹瀉，其潛伏時期通常很短，患者嘔吐·腹瀉·抽筋，有時甚至昏厥。罐裝魚肉·醃魚醃肉·和牛乳等食物，都有沾染葡萄球菌屬的可能。不過，據研究統計結果，由於葡萄球菌毒素引起的腹瀉病例，並不很多，所以不致形成嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>流行狀態</p>
<p>急性細菌性腹瀉流行時期，多在夏秋二季，這大概是因為氣候炎熱，利於細菌繁殖的緣故，同時熱天蒼蠅活躍，把疾病傳播開來。除了時令關係之外，其他幫助促進成腹瀉流行的各種因素也須加以考慮，像人口擁擠，地方污穢，食水不潔，食物腐敗等等。</p>
<p>急性細菌性腹瀉的流行性非常之大，差不多凡是吃過那種含有病菌食物的人都要害腹瀉，其少數倖免的人，或者是因為吃的數量很少，或者是因為胃酸充足，把病菌消減了，或者是因為抵抗力強。據蓋琪（Geiger）统计，吃含菌食物的人，發生腹瀉的達百分之七五至一〇〇。</p>
<p>但急性細菌性腹瀉的死亡率却是很低，據蓋氏統計，在美國，其死亡率祗百分之〇·五，又據沙氏統計，在英國其死亡率祗百分之一·五。男女患者的病率和死亡率無甚差別。就年齡而言，幼年和老年患者的死亡率較高。吸雅片，腹瀉時患其他慢性病症而致體力衰弱，飢餓，和營義不足，都足以促進急性細菌腹瀉的惡化。</p>
<p>症狀</p>
<p>沙門氏菌屬和赤痢桿菌腹瀉，其潛伏時期自半小時至廿四小時之間。由葡萄菌毒素所引起的腹瀉，其潛伏時期較短，大致在半小時至四小時之間。食物中所含之毒素愈多，症狀顯露愈快，此外，潛伏期間的長短，還有別的因素，譬如那不潔的食物吃下去的時候，肚子正空着，那末症狀很快的就顯露出來；又如吃下的東西全是含菌或有菌毒的，比較食物同時吃下去的症狀顯露來得早。因為食物先進胃部所以急性胃炎症狀較急性小腸炎和結腸炎症狀早發生。患者先覺腹上部膨脹，不久就覺疼痛，繼以嘔吐，——最初吐出來的是所吃東西和粘液，但無胃液，即使有胃液，也是極少；繼則嘔吐粘液，口涎和胆汁，有時並吐血少許，接着發生腹部痙攣腹痛。昏眩虛脫等症狀。吐得劇烈的，往往發生脫水狀態。汗流不止，肌肉痙攣疼痛，坐臥不安，皮膚冰冷發青，並且起皺，面部瘦削，聲音嘶啞，呼吸急促，溫度降至常度以下，血壓低落，周圍靜脉耗竭，脉博微弱。大便的形狀視腸受侵部位而異：患小腸炎的，大便量多，稀薄如水，臭氣難聞；患結腸炎的，大便內有粘液，血液，或濃，但不作水狀。患者有時覺得肛門痛脹，這是因為直腸受到刺激或結腸炎已經延及直腸之故。病狀輕的急性症狀在十二至廿四小時內自動消除。此後幾天內，食慾不振，身體軟弱，腹部略覺不適，不能進大量飲食，此後便告恢復。就是病勢劇重的，如果治療得當，也能很平安地痊愈復元，不過日子稍長罷了。可是腹瀉時如果併發他症，那就有使病態惡化的危險，患者會因中毒過深，極度脫水，和精力猝衰（由於酸中毒和尿毒所致）而告死亡。有時在初期症狀——吐瀉——發生以後，接着就發生類似傷寒的一種症狀，那是因為內部其他各種器官及組織受病菌侵襲的原故。而在這種情形之下，病期就要拖長，而且往往有併發他症的危險，像枝氣管肺炎，維生素缺乏症，褥瘡遷徒性膿毒症等等。有時，一個人患了急性細菌性腹瀉後，雖經治療，但是腸內病未能澈底消減，變成慢性囬歸性小腸結腸炎，往往累年不愈，情形與慢性或囬歸性赤痢相彷。</p>
<p>傳染之檢定</p>
<p>急性細菌性腹瀉病例通常並不難於診斷，尤其是在同一家庭裏面有多人患腹瀉的時候。一家裏面，有時幾個人同時腹瀉，那是因為同時吃了不潔食物之故；有時一家人先後腹瀉，那是因為進食的時間有先後，或則由互相傳染所致。</p>
<p>急性細菌性腹瀉無論是小規模地在一個家庭裏面發生，或是大規模地在一羣人或一個地方傳染流行，都應當用下列手續加以調查研究：（一）作一個完備的病例統計，（二）搜集病史，（三）尋求傳染途徑，（四）研究致病食物的來源，（五）搜集各種證據，藉知食物沾染病菌或毒素的由來。此外，還要搜集與腹瀉發生和傳染有關的各種東西而加以檢驗：（一）吃剩的食物，（二）患者吐出物和大便，（檢驗吐出物往往不如檢驗大便所得結果之確實），（三）遇有可認為病菌已侵入體內其他部份的情形時，那末應當作骨髓培養，血液培養，大便培養，吐涎培養，和凝集反應，（四）如患者死亡，則須將腸內容納物，腸黏膜，腸黏膜淋巴腺，骨髓，心血，脾及肝作細菌培養。（五）如果檢驗結果，找不出沙門氏桿菌或赤痢桿菌，那末應當檢驗所吃的東西裏面有無細菌毒素存在。</p>
<p>預防</p>
<p>急性細菌性腹瀉的預防方法，除了細菌性腹瀉的預防方法，除了注重環境衛生，個人衛生和飲水清潔之外，還要作種種預防的措置，使肉類（因為急性細菌性腹瀉大都由肉類傳染，所以特別注重肉類）從宰割至烹煮進食的過程中，免受病菌沾染。衛生當局應當嚴格檢驗肉類，病畜絕對禁售禁食。餐館家庭，不可僱用曾患腸疾的廚子。食物應當選用新鮮的，而且應當透煮後，方可進食。罐頭類食品往往煮沸至一小時以上還有活的細菌可以找到，大都為嗜熱桿菌，或產芽胞細菌。據許多人檢驗研究結果，罐頭食照百分之七左右含有細菌。可是臨時調製的食品含菌的比較罐頭食物更多，所以必須煮熟而食，——食物煮熟以後，即使細菌未被全部殺滅，至少也減少了許多。食物煮好後，如果不立刻就吃，那末應當把它放在陰涼之處，最好放在冰箱裏面，否則殘存的細菌又要繁殖起來而作崇了</p>
<p>在此霍亂流行時間，有些人會把厲害的急性細菌性腹瀉，誤認為霍亂。其實，牠們的傳染途徑，頗有相似之處；牠們的預防方法，也有相同之處——一切飲料食物，必需煮熟消毒！！！</p>
<p>病菌故事</p>
<h3>瘧原蟲自述</h3>
<p>— 陶壽淇</p>
<p>自從一八八〇年我初次被人類發現到現在，算來已有六十多年。但是除了醫學界之外，許多人對於我還是沒有相當認識，讓我乖此機會不妨來一個自我介紹。</p>
<p>我是動物界裏最起碼的一份子：我全身的組織完全由一個細胞單獨造成，所以動物學家稱呼我「瘧原虫」。我的體軀幼小的時候只有人血中紅血球的十分之一二那麼大，頂大的時候不過比平常紅血球稍微大些。</p>
<p>我的身體雖然這樣簡單而渺小，但是我一生的經歷，倒是相當複雜。我整個的生活史可以分為以下兩個週期：</p>
<p>（一）第一是無性生殖週期——發生於人類的血液內。走入人體的途徑，是當某種蚊子咬人的時候，從牠嘴裏帶入人的皮膚，侵入血液中。在血液裏我就寄住在紅血球中，並且依靠着紅血球中的滋養料生長及增殖，每隔一天兩天或三天，我由一個分裂成十多個。過了一個時期，還產生生殖原虫，分雌雄之別。這種生殖原虫要傳代接種，必須等蚊子再來咬人的時候，乘機從蚊子的口腔進入牠的胃部。</p>
<p>（二）從這裏起，我們便開始過有性生殖週期。在蚊子的胃內，雌雄原虫結合以後，就鑽入胃壁，再逐漸長大變成一個卵囊。等成熟後，卵囊爆裂，放出許多生殖性芽胞，散佈於蚊子的全身，尤其在牠的唾液腺裏面特別多。這整個的有性生殖週期，平均需要十至十二天方可完成。如果到這個時候，這個蚊子又去咬人，就可以把我這些生殖芽胞跟着牠的唾液帶進人的血內，從新發動一個無性生殖週期。</p>
<p>要表明我一生的艱苦，我還得把我的生活情形補充幾點：</p>
<p>（一）我的寄生的生活是一種絕對的需要（寄生學上稱為固需的寄生）就是說離開了人體或是蚊體我就絕對不能生存。</p>
<p>（二）在蚊類中，不是每一種蚊子都可以給我寄生，祗有安奴斐雷屬（Aropheles）內的幾種才適合。而且這些蚊子亦常受人的厭惡，蚊子被害我亦就活不成。</p>
<p>（三）在人體內我寄生之處，是他的血中的紅血球，是他生命上一個非常重要的部份。因此，我在裏面生長，勢必防害人的健康，使他發生各種可怕的瘧疾症狀，有時甚至會使他死亡。要是真的我寄宿的主人死了，我亦祗得跟著他同歸於盡。這種地位，是我們過寄生生活者最不幸的。</p>
<p>像我過着這樣神秘而苦悶的生活，確實害人害己。好在直到現在，許多人尚不明白瘧疾的真相，不知道是我在從中作怪，還以為患了瘧疾是吸了空中什麽瘴氣，或是喝了地上的什麽髒水，才會生病，否則在現代人類科學進步聲中，潔蚊防蚊的方法日見有效之時，對我的生存滋長，更要受到大大的威脅了。</p>
<h3>中暑</h3>
<p>— 鄭偉如</p>
<p>楊延年剛於六月廿九日下午完畢初中的大考，一連數日的預備功課和繳考試卷，竟使他於每餐時也減食好多。加之他競爭心很強，所以臨到每課考試，還加開夜車，現在大考圓滿結束，他感到如釋重負，竟快樂得興奮起來。以前因預備考試而生的疲勞，現在反而一些也不覺到。所以約定於三十日星期天和他哥哥同往江灣郊外去野餐。他哥哥見延年情緒快樂，興緻濃厚，又為酬謝他考試的辛勞，不忍拂他弟弟的請求，加之三十日恰是星期日正好假此陪他一同玩個暢快。所以一口答應。關於野餐的全部準備，也由他一個人去準備，延年聽了更加高興。自抗戰以來因著敵人的什麽封鎖警戒，把延年活躍的心，拘束得如在樊籠裏一樣。現今抗戰勝利，他所日夜憧憬的江灣市中心區，將于明日可以暢遊了。</p>
<p>翌日晨十時，二人帶了乾糧水果等坐街車出發，在車中很覺擁擠，而且顛簸，延年略感不適，祗是當時興緻很濃，就把精神提了起來，下車後又在陽光下步行十多分鐘，已經有些疲憊，兩腿舉步很重，胸部沉悶，連呼吸多感無力。這時舉步蹣跚，頭部眩暈，眼前一陣昏黑，突地倒在他哥哥的懷裏。他哥哥幸已覺察到延年的顏面蒼白，嘴唇沒有一點血色，額上汗珠涔涔，面有痛苦表情，並且舉步艱難，心知有異，及至看到他弟弟有傾跌的趣勢，就一手把他抱住，覺得延年的手臂很涼，便連呼延年延年怎麼怎麼？他弟弟祗有氣沒力的囬說難受難受。這時延年已被移置於路旁的樹蔭下將就的在樹幹旁躺下，他哥哥把他的扣子打開，把汗珠擦乾，隨把所帶的薄荷錠在嘴唇四周涂了一遍，這時見延年已清醒了好多，所以又切了一枚橘子給他吃，延年此時已漸恢復，並且勉強可以坐起，他哥哥因此也寬慰了許多，就僱車送他囬家休息。</p>
<p>上面的一節正是講述在暑天所見的中暑力竭現象。在高氣溫及高相對濕度之環境下，若再加生理失常神經過度緊張，衣服過厚過緊，通風不良，人羣相處擁擠，心臟機能最易失調而致暈厥。所以在急救方面，儘可能當把患者移置於陰涼通風之處。寬鬆或脫去脫衣服。用冷水潑面或胸部，促病人蘇醒，或嗅以芳香氣酒精等興奮劑，以使病人脫離險境。中暑力竭是各型中暑之較輕者，但若救治不當也可招致死亡！</p>
<p>另有高熱性中暑，在熱帶區為地方病，該病往往發生於初進熱帶區的新移民。當地人士似比較少見，大概習慣於高熱氣候的人，身體機構已經熟習應付高氣溫的方法，上海地區，每於暑天亦可見到該症，患者原因，亦係身處高氣溫及高相對濕度之環境下，飲水過少，衣服不適，出汗停止，體溫一時無法放散，有時出汗停止自一小時至四十八小時，身體所產熱量無方散放而積聚體內，遂致體溫繼續高昇。病人或有吐瀉，狀如霍亂，或精神不安，煩燥譫妄，皮膚燥熱，及至直腸溫度達四十二·二度，神志即行不清。如此高熱，若聽其持續兩小時，往往無囬蘇希望。故在治療方面，越快越好，否則數小時的延遲，就將不救。主要是在減低體溫達到一個安全日度數為止。方法是將冷水澆過全身，再以扇子將身體四周空氣流動，或將濕巾包裹患者身體，再以扇子將空氣流動，此法即以人工方法，使身體有如出汗效能，以達減低體溫目的。又法是將病人置於十一度之水中，同時曆擦全身，使皮膚血液加速循環，以使高體溫之得能放散；同時，注意直腸體溫，如達到三八·八，即需將病人起出冷水以免體溫急劇下降，而致虛脫。經試驗所知，一克的水自皮膚蒸發，所需熱量約半卡餘。若以一克之冰，放置皮膚上，使之溶化，所自皮膚吸收的熱量，尚不足十分之一卡。所以用冰來減低體溫，及不如用水之有效。而且皮膚一遇到過冷的冰，毛細血管，多會收縮，這於減低體溫方面又是一個阻碍。以前還有人用冰水灌腸，以求減低高體溫，但是據實驗所知，用一千克的冰水灌腸，其所減的熱量，祗相等於自皮膚上蒸發七十克水的熱量。其他如生理鹽水的靜脈注射，以促毒素的排洩，心臟及呼吸興奮劑的運用，當依病人情況而定。</p>
<p>尚有所謂日射病，由於太陽光直射於人體所致，症狀方面有如腦脊髓膜炎。病人有極度頭痛，皮膚燥熱，畏光，嘔吐，以至高熱狂妄。其治療大致與高熱性中暑相同。</p>
<p>又有一種中暑現象，病徵以腹部或全身痛楚之痙攣為主，體溫並不過高，蓋患者在高氣溫中工作，出汗甚多，所以感到口渴，就大量飲水來解渴。但是高氣溫的環境，仍舊不變，當繼續出汗，繼續口渴，這樣循環下去，因所飲之水，不含食鹽，而所出的汗內，含自萬分之六至千分之六的食鹽。體內的食鹽，繼續出汗液排出而不加補充，就生痛楚的痙攣現象。故在治療方面，除將病人移出高熱之環境外，生理食鹽水之靜脈注射，為唯一療法。均在高氣溫工作的工人，應常以千分之一的食鹽水，作為飲料。在此次戰爭時，英國巡艦以百分之一之冰涼食鹽水作為飲料。</p>
<p>人類得天獨厚，每處于各種惡劣環境中，亦能知所適應。在北極冰天雪地，亦有人類居住。在熱帶地區，氣候當在四十度以上，人類亦有蹤跡。並為求生存起見，須作種種活動。如在熱帶輪船上鍋爐房之加煤工人，有時需在攝氏六十五度中工作，也不見有中暑現象。可見祗要健康完整，生理調節機能正常，不使體力過　度疲乏，除營養外應補充適量的水份及食鹽。工作的環境，雖是高氣溫和高相對濕度，祗要通風透氣，所穿衣服不妨碍發汗及放散體溫，那末我人工作時所產生的熱量，其中百分之廿五須由皮膚蒸長及呼吸放散，百分之七十五經由皮膚輻射及對流作用而放散，不致積聚體內。那末，雖不能說就不會有中暑危險，也大可減少許多。</p>
<p>我國人在夏天患病，或是傷寒霍亂或是飲食不慎而致吐瀉，或是屬於中暑一類的病症，往往以為發痧而小看它，若不加以適當的治療，就會遺誤病人至於不救。</p>

<h3>救救敎師</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>我要爲許多中小學教員呼籲！尊師運動雖然已過去、願大家看到自己的子女時，想到他們的先生，尊師，愛師，替老師們的生活打算一下，不啻爲自己的子女前途着想。</p>
<p>不止一個，也不止十個，我所熟識的很多很多中小學教員，他們已到了無衣可當，無物可賣的地步。其中有不少用借貸的方式擺報攤，經營流動玻璃櫃，抗戰勝利後的今日，發生此種景象，而又是在這羣知識份子人之師表身上，我們不覺得慚愧嗎？</p>
<p>人窮志短，教師們如果每天腦子裏在愁柴愁米，請問，他們還有什麼心思去訓誨你的令郎令愛？而且，爲了保持師道尊嚴，你也不能叫你的子女輕視，渺視，卑視他們的老師。一個穿得襤褸的教員，站在講台上，你的小姐公子往往會竊竊私語的，說：吿化子，羅宋癟三的罷！</p>
<p>不必再引伸，說什麼爲了國家培植人材，就算爲你自己光耀門庭，就算爲你的孩子將來能立足社會罷，你也得想想這一大批矻矻自守喫粉筆灰的人們。</p>
<p>對此，讀者中如有捐獻，本報願爲服務。</p>
<h3>談「色」</h3>
<p>— 東方荆</p>
<p>一九三一年，比利時著名學生科學家，奧格斯特及琴·比卡德作初度同溫層探險飛行，蔣飛船漆成白色，結果招來了許多冰霜，他們差不多凍死。一九三二年，他們二度飛行同溫層，把飛船漆成黑色，他們又幾乎給燒死。後來，有兩個美國陸戰隊官員探險同溫層，把飛船的一半漆成淡色，另一半漆或深色，他們的飛行是極愉快舒適的—他們所呼吸到的空氣是凉爽的，他們的腿部感覺到溫暖。</p>
<p>到了今天，心理學家及科學家已經昭示我們，在許多方面，顏色都大有裨助於日常生活的舒適。</p>
<p>南極探險家，把他們的水壺袋漆成黑色，以防冰凍；白天，這些水袋吸收充份的陽光，使壺中的水保持六十度的熱度，雖然外面的氣候，却在零下三十五度。</p>
<p>蘇聯的艦船一向漆成紅色，在兩年之前，改漆黑色，以保存熱力；船員們不僅感到舒適許多，工作效率也因之大增了。</p>
<p>黑色吸收陽光的力量是驚人的。冰凍的海港將積雪掃去，漆成黑色，可以早好幾個星期解凍。裏色路面上的冰雪，比白色路面上的冰雪融化得快。</p>
<p>黑色的馬，比其他顏色的馬，遭受到更多陽光的炙熱，所以黑馬的壽命也比白馬來得短促。</p>
<p>關於健康方面，顏色的力量是卓越的。顏色工程師，從飛機內部的色調上，防止「飛行病」。他們發現棕色與黃色容易引起嘔吐，而綠色及藍色則能够防止嘔吐。有一家航空公司，聽從專家的建議，停止供應蛋黃牛乳醬，把臥機內的白色背單，枕套，毽子都改　綠色，效果大佳。</p>
<p>不久以前，芝加哥有一家旅館，試騐顏色的功效，他們請了一些客人來晚餐。桌上擺着新鮮的牛排和蔬菜，動人食慾的冷盤和甜品，大家食慾很好，談笑風生；突然之間，燈光改變了顏色，一種特製的燈泡，散放出色帶中所有的顏色，除了紅和綠以外。結果牛排變成了灰白色，牛奶變成血紅的。</p>
<p>幾分鐘以內，有幾個客人感覺到要嘔，還有幾個人非常的不舒服，宴會立刻停止，因爲火家的食慾；都失掉了。</p>
<p>多里杜有一家百貨公司，職工的服裝、只限黑色和藏靑的，大家都皺眉頭，後來人事科換了一位新主任，取消了這條限令，鼓勵女職員穿着顏色比較漂亮的衣服。結果，職員們活潑，熱心得多，而公司中的氣氛也變得愉快，生意也好了不少。</p>
<p>顏色也可以抵禦蚊子的侵擾。有一位專家說，如果你討厭蚊子，在你不到的地方開一盞藍燈，蚊子都飛過去了。在你坐着的地方，開一　紅燈，蚊子就不會來了。昆蟲往往誤解藍光爲天空；昆蟲也知道紅色是危險的信號，避而不前。</p>
<p>根據正確的統計，夜總會的客人，在琥珀色的燈光下，比在其他顏色燈光下，玩的時候久。</p>
<p>宇宙間共有多少種顏色呢？沒有人知道。在學理上說，可以有一千萬種顏色。普通人們的說法，是幾千種。</p>
<p>顏色和音樂頗爲相似，一個激動視覺。一個激動聽覺，同時兩者全是一種震動。而顏色是更爲有力的，因爲我們多數的感覺是由視覺而來的。</p>
<h3>買米記</h3>
<p>— 國昌</p>
<p>米缸裏的米吃完了，總不能挺着空肚子受餓，於是想到米店裘去買些米來。</p>
<p>從東到西，從南到北，跑遍了幾十家米舖，全是升斗朝天，空空如也，沒奈何，限價米是買不到的了，祗得向隔壁張先生情商暫借白米一斗，預備米店裏出售限價米時立刻奉趙。</p>
<p>等啊！等！餓得老百姓昏天黑地，人鬼難分，總算透出一絲消息，說是全市要普遍發售限價米了。這該是一樁多麼可喜的佳音啊！</p>
<p>翌晨，特地起來得早點，提了米袋怱忽趕到附近一爿米店時，店門口已經黑黝黝地擠滿了成百的人。喊聲，哭聲，罵聲混在一起，鬧得天昏地黑也沒有一個警察來維持一下秩序。買到了米的擠不出來，買不到米的還拼命價往裏擠。內中有好幾個頭戴歪帽，身穿短衫褲的朋友，却憑着自己身材高大，以强力衝入人羣，不到幾分鐘功夫，背着米又衝出來了。這樣穿梭般衝進衝出的結果，倒有好幾石米都落到這幾個人的手裏去了。自己因爲體弱無力，祗得望米興嘆，蹣跚而返。可是張家的米總不能不還，再拖欠下去也有些不好意思，於是已經走到中途，重又折回原處，被迫向歪帽子朋友做黑市交易，每斗要多付一千元。</p>
<p>還了張家的白米，自己的食米又無着落了，唉！老百姓的限價米在哪裏呢？</p>
<h3>容與中流</h3>
<h3>今日的上海醫院</h3>
<p>— 富民</p>
<p>我很感謝記者先生爲大衆幸福着想去調查醫院事業佔着很寳貴的篇幅，敢以一得之愚，向諸君談談醫院。</p>
<p>醫院是什麼事業呢？倒底還是公共衛生專家李建安博士說得透切：「醫學不是慈善事業是偉大的建設事業」。從前一般社會人士以爲施診給藥就盡了慈善的責任，不知人體是一個最靈敏最複雜不過的機器，要達到健康的目的，非時時檢騐修理不可；若僅用以前的一切診斷和藥物，顯然是拿人力畫與汽車飛機來互相比較了。我們都知道一切交通工具是建設的命脈，而人體的健康和維護更是健設的基礎。所以醫學事業就是一切建設的建設，換言之有了完美的醫學方才可以達到完美的建設。這是醫學的使命。至於辦一般企業可以發財，而醫學則否；因為病者一旦恢復健康，可以發揮他的天才，對於社會國家有很多種的貢獻，而醫院方面除了得到一些相當費用之外，只有服務和犧牲。何以呢？譬如某醫院要買一架新X光機價格爲一萬美金，一年後交貨；我們都知道一萬美金現時爲二千六百萬國幣，以黑市利息計算，每四個月加一倍，則一年以後爲二萬萬元；即使到了上海，應用起來，所得决不能超過利息。換言之，得到好處的人，還是一般人士。一經檢查可以獲得健康的保障。早期診斷和治療的機會，節省醫藥費。早復健康而後可以從事於生產，日日新又日新，而醫院的機器却一年比一年舊。這僅是一個例子，醫院之服務和犧牲可見一般，那麼這種的設備和工作不就是「人海慈航」據筆者調查所知，某私立療養院有長期免費病人住至數年之久者，又完全不納費，從進院至出院爲止，在最近二三年中，有百餘人之多，爲任何醫院所不及；又在「八一三」滬戰時，將全部手術機械X光等悉數交給傷兵醫院作爲救護之用。又上海淪陷時期，醫藥缺乏，特聯合全市醫院作大規模免費X光檢查之防癆運動，俾深入民間治療普及。這不是「普救衆生」嗎？現時一般民衆眞正的正在歧路徬徨着，一旦有病還是服用成藥呢，還是延醫診治呢？實在大可不必，我們祗要：（一）維持正常健康，（二）必須及時施行預防注射及各種檢查，（三）早期知道病源，則可早期治療，早復健康。我們主張：一個醫院第一要服務社會第二要協助推行公共衛生。但請諸位放眼一看那一個醫院眞正的向着這兩條路走呢？</p>
<p>末了要聲明公濟醫院每天三萬五千元，中美醫院每天五萬元，要超過任何私立醫院的收費。這是不得巳的。希望能由社會的力量，協助醫院的困難，减低收費，造福市民大衆！</p>
<h3>管敎嚴格</h3>
<p>— 方山</p>
<p>本月六日，本刊登載了一篇「讀自卑後」，是闡述讀了「自卑」後的感想的。作者嚴密地診斷出：自卑是一種極其嚴重的「心理病」。結論是：「誠懇，有禮貌，和靄可親是需要的，但必須得體，大方，不要把自己變成一個可憐的綿羊！」這確實是一句極可珍貴的箴言，是「自卑病患者」的一服對症發藥的特效劑</p>
<p>作者把這種「自卑病」的起因歸之於「舊式家庭的家庭教育」，他說這種敎育「素來就要把小孩子教得呆板，拘謹，……」這也是一針見血的不磨之論。但是，在這時候，却又有普通學校所定爲方針——實際是「以廣招徠」——的金字招牌：「管教嚴格」四個大字，赫然的現在我的眼前。</p>
<p>招牌當然也就是廣吿。這廣吿的開端，往往是這樣的：「本校功課認眞，管教嚴格，深得社曾人士之信仰。」至於結尾，性念的起稿者，或許還會寫上一些「靑年學子，盍興乎來」之類的話。</p>
<p>所謂管教嚴格，實在是說不通的。因爲旣說有嚴的一方面，便應當有寬的一方面，難道教育眞可分爲嚴的教育和寬的教育兩類嗎？實際上，在善於教育的人的腦海中，決不會有嚴或是寬那樣的字眼的。他們只是注意到怎樣使學生通過合理的生活，來接受智識的啓迪，體格的鍛鍊，和道德的陶養而已。</p>
<p>正像「陸稿薦」，「張小泉」的不易辨別誰真誰假的一樣，舉世滔滔的學校都掛起了一塊「管教嚴格」的招牌，於是一般憧憬於「管教嚴格」的家長們也就無所適從，大有望「牌」興嘆之感了。</p>
<p>「管敎嚴格」這一敎條的眞正虔誠信奉和身體力行者的法寳，拆穿西洋鏡的說起來，也是可憐的只有兩種：一個是「罵」，一個就是「打」。（不過最後還有一副「殺手鐧」——「開除」，因爲限於篇幅，只好割愛不述了。）</p>
<p>罵要够得上標準，就是要罵得「狗血噴頭」，例如「你們都是癟三」，「你們都是流氓」之類。超過罵的程度的，便是打。打也要够得上標準，就是要打得學生手掌浮腫。不過「打」有兩個限制：一是不能打出血來，因爲縱然是「管教嚴格」教條之信奉者的家長，見到自己子弟被打得至於出血，也要禁不住心疼，這會影響到下半年主顧的减少；一是不能打年紀大身體高的學生，因爲他們可能反抗，而你的體力不一定能够做他們「角力」的對手。</p>
<p>至於罵和打的時候，不外是學生在上課時不肯恭聆催眠曲般的講解，或是下課時在學校僅有的一點隙地膽敢滑冰拋球，或是……的時候。總之，你的口·手·脚·不可妄動，不可蠢動。你應當靜，應當斯文，應當循規蹈矩，這才好。你如果要妄動，蠢動，我就要打和駡。能打，多尊嚴，多偉大！但是能够駡，也算有些尊嚴和偉大了。「初中的小學生倒也見我怕，」這是駡手勝利的凱歌。</p>
<p>兒童剛剛跳出了「奮式家庭的家庭教育」的火坑，但立即又陷入這種打罵俱備的「管教嚴格」教條的羅網，於是，他們的自尊心，創造力，鮮有不被斵傷削弱甚至完全斷送的。</p>

<h3>計劃非艱實行維艱</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>偉大的大上海建，設計劃，其初步將使商業區擴展至南市，而南市錯綜複雜恍若迷宮的狹小街道，均須拆除，漢口路將放關成爲次要交通天道……。記得當局在不久以前，僅僅爲欲拓寬界路和浙江路路面，一時請願訴苦者便紛至沓來。如果建設大上海計劃實施，時勢必又將大拆房屋，是否能够順利進行，倒是一個問題。</p>
<p>看近幾天報上天文台的氣候預測，好像賭台上打大小一樣，打了大偏開小，打了小偏開大，因此很使人懷疑，預測的倒底是那一天？但是說天文台所公布的完全不可靠，倒也未必，吾敢保證，至少溫度升降的報吿，是十分準確的。</p>
<p>到現在爲止，似乎火柴商人尙未高聲「叫救命」，但是恐怕為期也不遠了，你看，個個人手裏不是都有一隻打火機嗎？</p>
<p>一位剛從重慶飛來的小姐，口口聲聲說上海住不慣，不若香港有山有水，風景好。可是重慶一樣也有山也有水，爲何却又不願意久居，天天鬧着要回來呢？</p>
<p>兩路局大舞弊案中的處長太太，據說至今還住在上海，而且一再由本埠寄信到報館，有所辯白，我很佩服她的胆子，難道竟不怕調查戶口？</p>
<p>當局規定買米須惡戶牌，每口准買五升以後，大家對戶脾也就重視起來了。「戶牌是什麼」？却有許多人還不知道，豈不笑話！</p>

<h3>寄給亡婦鳳君（四）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>兒女們在家裏一共躭了四日夜，繞膝承歡，平添了不少熱鬧的氣氛；他們見你老人家病勢未减，雖戀戀不忍遞去，可是因爲上海方面各有所事，只得頻道珍重，向你辭別了。你心中雖很難受，可是故意的不動聲色，只再三叮嚀他們在外一切小心，就把苦笑來送走了他們。我是知道你笑在臉上，痛在心裏的，只索用了技巧的詞令，婉喻曲譬的安慰你。</p>
<p>在兒女們走了之後的第三天，記得是農曆三月十五日，這很可咒詛的一天，草坪上的牡丹壇裏，盛放了一百多朶的玉樓春和二十多朶的紫牡丹，活色生香，賞心悅目。我一淸早就摘了三朶玉樓春，插在膽瓶裏，送到你床邊的小几上；你看了那粉霞色的花容，聞了那淸妙的花香，不由得喜上眉梢。趁着起身梳頭和舖床的特光，你照例要到廊下去坐一會，先在籐靠椅上靠了幾分鐘，養一養神，就要我扶着到牡丹壇前，欣賞那一朶朶爭姸鬭艷的牡丹，你見自己骨瘦如柴，容顏憔悴，便又發起「人不如花」的慨歎來；於是黯然不歡，一步黏不開兩步的回房休息去了。這天午後的情形並不算壞，本來在四五點鐘時吃一杯奶粉的，今天你却要吃粥，幷且還吃了兩小塊紅肅肉；到了七點半鐘，你又照例用晚餐，雖只淺淺的一碗薄粥，却也並不减少，我認爲這是樂觀的現象，心就放寬了一半。却不料當晚十一點鐘光景，突然起了變卦，我正在黑甜鄉中睡得很甜，猛聽得那宿在一房的葉媽，沒口子的嚷着道：「太太怎麼了？太太怎麼了？」我被這一片吶喊聲驚醒過來，忙不迭的從你脚邊豎起了身，對着你瞧，却見你兩眼上挿，口吐白沫，一陣子『嘔…嘔…嘔…』的在哼。我忙將自己的兩個枕頭墊在你的　子下，把你的頭扶了起來，連連喚着：『鳳！鳳！快快醒來！快快醒來！』一會兒葆妹葉媽和蓮兒熙甥都披衣起封，從隔房趕過來了。於是大家哭着嚷着，拉顯髮的拉頭髮，擰人中的擰人中，忙亂了好一會，你還是沒有醒，還是『嘔…嘔…嘔…』的哼個不停。我除了哭嚷，一時慌張得不知所措；還是葆妹有主意，忙把世京喚起，立刻去請吳醫師；不過吳醫師回說半夜三更，不出診了，再去請那位當初介紹吳醫師的龐醫師，想以朋友的立塲請他破例來救一救急，不道門上圑說：龐醫師下鄉去了。我看養你人事不知的僵臥在我的臂間，只管大哭大嚷，不知如何是好；沒法兒想，只得去請那足智多謀的老友程小靑兄，難為他從熱被窩中起了身，急匆匆地趕來了。他以爲喚世京去請吳醫師，不够鄭重，該由我親自去請，也許吳醫師看了我的薄面，會勞駕一次的。好在世京平日租拉的那輛黃包車正停在家裏。就由他拉我上吳醫師家去，短短的一段路，一會兒已到了。吳醫師在高樓上聽得了我的聲音，仍然不肯下來，他的太太也帮同回絕，我一時悲憤交集，嘶啞着聲音大喊道：「也罷，就看着她死吧！『當下長歎了一聲，絕望地踅出吳醫師的大門。纔走了幾十步路，却出於意外的　　從高樓上飛下了論音玉旨，原來是吳太太的一片吳儂軟語，說：『等一等，且讓吳醫師去看一看吧！」我大喜過望，連聲稱謝，重又回到了大門口，耐心地等了一會，等吳醫師提着藥包走出來時，我不由得跪下來在門限上向他叩了一個響頭，表示我的感激之忱。當下由世京的車兒拉着吳醫師趕回去，我跟在車後氣噓噓地踏着快步，這夜月色很好，雖然行人絕跡，我也一些兒不怕；口中一面宣佛號，一面喊耶穌，求他們搭救你；這　兒，我的神志早已錯亂了。</p>

<h3>許傑怎樣批評沈從文</h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>二十年來，沈從文始終像一個稻草做的箭靶，讓那些批評的箭一支一支射上來，他不大答辦，他的作品底本身，就是最好的答辯。</p>
<p>政治上的宗派主義已經成爲中國走向憲政之路的一塊最沉重的絆脚石，其實不僅在政治上是如此，文壇上宗派和門戶的成見更深，假使一個作家沒有自己的集團，甚至小組織也沒有，那末不論你的態度是如何嚴肅，不論你是如何地實踐了現實主義的方法，不論你所創造的人物如何典型化，仍舊不能得到公平的待遇。照理說現實主義原不是一種可以專利的商品，應該沒有只此一家並無分出的口舌，嫡糸的紛爭正統的紛爭究竟有什麼意義也很難說，因爲這是創作上的方法問題，原沒有什麼衣缽可傳的。左拉和巴爾札克之間，固然存在着莫大的距離，然而都不失爲自然主義的作家，現代的物質文明進步是相當進步的，還不能不依翁人類的思維去產生文藝作品，換句話說，就是機器旣然不能製造定型的文藝，現實主義的作品也就必然有着多樣性。能够做到把凱撒的還給凱撤，文藝批評的初步任務也就完成了。假使只見樹木不見森林，的確是最危險不過的傾向，一篇作品有色情的成份存在着的話，批評家有指出來的必要，但就此貿然地認爲這是一篇色情的作品，一筆抹煞它的價值，那就無異於把浴盆洗浴的小孩子和洗髒了的浴水一齊倒掉，根本不是批評家應有的態度。</p>
<p>許傑先生曾接連寫了三篇文章，批評沈從文的「看虹錄」，「摘星錄」和「笨人」，我們所預備討論的是其中的第一篇。</p>
<p>「你歡喜看色情文學嗎，朋友！那末，我給你介紹，你去看新文學第一期上的看虹錄」。這篇批評文章是如此開頭的，中國古代的哲人曾說：「仁者見仁，智者見智。」這是最眞理的眞理，因爲客觀的存在就是那麼樣的一個客觀的存在，固然無時無刻不在變化，但並不是隨我們的心理狀能變化的，而是依據一定的法則的；我們同時觀察一件事物，得到的印像和結論很不容易相同，因為每個人的主觀就等於一副有色眼鏡，所以仁者只見仁，智者只見智，許傑先生的靈魂深處充塞着色情，所以只能在「看虹錄」裏發掘色情，話說穿了，原沒有什麼神秘的，弗洛依德從精神分析學的見地，把人類一切行爲都解釋成性的行爲，也是同樣的道理。</p>
<p>對於小說中那一段主觀的獨白，許傑先生顯然沒有深度理解：所謂「我完全活在一種觀念，並非活在實際世界中」，這並不是作者要不要如此的問題而是說在「向雲空凝眸來耗費這個時間」的情形之下，一個人有着如此的錯覺而已，因事實上人不能不活在實際世界中，至於活在一種觀念中，原沒有這種可能性。「詩和火同樣使生命會燃燒起來的一只是比喻的說法，所謂詩，所謂火，都是抽象的，或者是象微的，可以是充沛的生命力，可以是外界某種富於美感或刺激性的形象所引起的情緒，假使說火是慾火，那麼詩又是什麼詩呢？普洛米修斯所竊取的火是不是也是慾火呢？</p>
<p>把肉體和肉慾混成一談，嚴格地說這是錯誤的，肉體的贊美不一定是肉慾的贊美，肉體在某種情形之下，可以是一件美術品似的客觀的存在，贊美的人只是從美術的觀點去贊美，欣賞他的幾根線條，欣賞他的完整而發展得非常勻稱的輪廓，欣賞他的一種深刻的表情或自在的姿態；一個康健的肉體，本來就意味着道德的本身，因此不但是最美的，同時也是最善的，歷代的大藝術家如米克朗基羅和羅丹等無不以人體為模特兒而習作一生，從這上面獲得種種啓示，來完成自己的藝術修養和人格修養。看見肉體就引起肉慾，只有最低級最庸俗的人是如此，他們沒有欣賞肉體的心理基礎，更不能想像別人是怎樣去欣賞的贊美的。</p>
<p>許傑先生旣然認爲「看虹錄」是色情文學，却又不憚麻煩地一段一段抄下來，這篇批評實際上是一篇摘記，所摘的是他印像最深的部份，雖說他的態度是否定的，假使「看虹錄」眞的是色情文學，這樣一來，他倒成爲色情文學的推銷者了；市上流行過一種戒鴉片烟的藥劑，據說裏面也就是鴉片烟，不過另外加了些麵粉而已，假使「看虹錄」眞的是色情文學，這篇批評的功用至多也只能和那種戒烟的藥劑相等。</p>
<p>在沈從文的故鄕湘西，原是漢族和苗族雜居的地方，遠在抗戰以前的四五十年中，由於山川的阻隔根本沒有被近代文明的觸角所伸入，那裏的生活依舊和松明，火把，神巫，黃紙符，野豬皮鼓不能分開來，依舊殘留着一部份原始的和中古的風尙；他在神話般的環境裏長大，無形之中的影響是很大的，他憧憬淳樸的愛情，追求純淨的精神底和諧和肉體的愉快，他的思想，他的人生觀，雖然有過些微的轉變，大體說來，和伊　鳩魯的樂生哲學始終相當接近，假如忽略了這一點，研究沈從文是白費了時間和筆墨。</p>

<p>我以爲又是那每晚來給我唸「亞門」的老小姐來了，這樣漫不經心地喊了一聲。可是當那扇綠漆的長門輕輕啓開之後，我的眼睛驀地睜大了，我看見了一個陌生的人！</p>
<p>不過那陌生的人也不能算完全陌生，因爲她穿着一件白色的制服，戴着一頂白色的帽子，帽子邊沿綻一道黑色狹邊。「是一位新來的護士長吧？」我這樣想着，走前一步，向她點點頭，問了聲：</p>
<p>「小姐尊姓？」</p>
<p>「我姓徐。你不認識我嗎？」</p>
<p>「好像沒有見過。也許我這個人太粗心。」我說。</p>
<p>「不，你並不粗心，你確是沒有看見過我。但我早已認識你，我看見過你的照片！」</p>
<p>「是嗎？」</p>
<p>見她向我神秘地一笑，我心裏禁不住有些驚奇，便又不自覺地跨前一步，對她細細打量了一下。</p>
<p>是一張扁圓形的平凡的臉，微黑之中夾着許多紅色的粉刺，鼻骨中段有一點凸起，眼睛和嘴巴都很小，…不能算十分美吧？可是她的身段生得非常玲瓏勻稱，不高不矮，不胖不瘦，一根帶子東在細軟腰圍裏，很有些楚楚動人。</p>
<p>時候已近午夜，月光很好，淡靑色的天空裏非常幽靜，我把床前一把椅子拖到窗口請她坐，她並不客氣，就坐下了。</p>
<p>照理，我是病人，一個陌生護士進來和我談談，似乎用不到驚異。然而這時候，我的心中突然湧起一圑疑雲，我覺得那護士的態度有些奇怪。至少：她是認識我的；或者，竟和我有過一些什麼關係。</p>
<p>我感到自己的心有些跳動，立在她面前，我說不出話。</p>
<p>「昨夜我已來看過你，但你睡着了。」她向我靜靜地望了一會，輕輕地說。</p>
<p>「唔…」</p>
<p>「我才上星期六從北平回來，但也不打算在這裏長住，一有機會，我就要到內地去的。」她又說了一句。</p>
<p>我點一點頭，還是不答話。</p>
<p>「昨晚我在病牌上見到你的名字，眞是說不出的奮興！世界上竟會有這樣的巧事，我到底看見了你！」說到這裏。她忽然又向我神秘地一笑，然後就沉默着，不再開口。</p>
<p>夜漸深。那奇怪的護士這樣靜靜的望着我，好幾次我覺得按捺不住，想請她爽快地說出怎麼會認識我，然而不知怎的，當我一接觸到她那神秘而又帶些可怕的眼光，就感到一陣微微寒慄，不敢啓口了。</p>
<p>似乎隔了良久良久，她才立起來向外走了、在路出去的時候，她授給我一樣東西，向我說：</p>
<p>「這裏面有一個你認識的人，看見了他，你也許可以明白我是誰！」</p>
<p>她出去了，帶去了那神秘而可怕的眼光，我關上房門回到床邊的挿燈前，發現殖授給我的是一本小小的紀念册。</p>
<p>坐在床前，我好奇翻開了那本紀念册。</p>
<p>第一頁上，我看見一幅小巧的畫，畫着一堆美麗的白雲，雲端站一個穿白衣的天使，伸開雙臂俯視着大地，在畫的右角，有二行細小的鋼筆字：</p>
<p>「獻給我的愛，我靈魂裏的白衣天使！」</p>
<p>我的手指抖動起來了，當我一看到二行小字底下的一個名字：「梅琪」，終於原來這奇怪的護士，就是梅琪的未婚妻徐湘英！</p>
<p>我沒有再翻閱下去，我記起了一個遙遠的故事：——</p>
<p>梅琪，——是的，那時候祗是個十五六歲的孩子吧？可是油滑得很，老是賊忒嘻嘻，瞇花着一對小眼睛，在隔壁西光中學的矮牆前偷看我們。</p>
<p>我們，當然全是些女孩子，有的跟梅琪差不多大小，有的比他小些，有的比他大，像我們高中二的一班人，那至少要比他大三三歲。</p>
<p>當時我們幾個較大的女孩子，都很怕西光中學的男學生，因爲他們很壞，一知道什麼人的名字，就要寫些肉麻的無頭信來求愛，所以我們一看見隔壁有人在偷看，總立刻逃走，再也不敢回看一眼的。</p>
<p>但我們都不怕梅琪，非但不怕，還有點歡喜他，不怕他的原因，當然是爲了他的歲數比我們小得多。的的確確還是個小孩子，歡喜他的原因呢，那說來好笑，原來梅琪雖是個男孩子，却生着一張女孩子的險孔，長長的鵝蛋臉兒，水汪汪的小眼睛，尤其可愛的，當他一笑的時候，左頰上立刻會出現一個很深的小酒渦，倒有三分像電影明星胡蝶的笑。</p>
<p>不淸楚從那一次起，我們有個歡喜取綽號的同學，給梅琪取了一個綽號叫「小花眼睛」。於是每逢梅琪賊忒嘻嘻站在矮牆邊偸看我們時，大家就低低的喚着：「小花眼睛！小花眼睛！」</p>
<p>一次，學校裏放了春假，大半同學都回去了，祗留下我和六七個外埠同學，那一天，我和一個同學在街上閑散，看見一爿水菓店門前，有一個男孩子立在那裏吃枇杷，那同學就低低的喊了聲：「看小花眼睛！看小花眼睛吃枇杷！」</p>
<p>大概喊得響了些，梅琪回過頭來對我們一笑，就走開了。</p>
<p>就在那第二天，我接到一封奇怪的信，沒有具名，僅寫着一句：「請問小姐，爲什麼稱我爲小花眼睛？」（未完）</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（八二）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>起初，麗華不答應，無奈墨太太和張弦再三懇求她，吿訴她，這樣會得罪了地方，對她們的戲班子是非常不利的。沒辦法，麗華只答應拜幾個乾爸爸可以，交朋友絕對不肯。墨太太也覺得麗華年紀還小，還不到交朋友的時候，因此便拿這個理由，拒絕了那批年靑的。雖然年靑的不免有些不高典，但因爲有年老的給麗華保鏢，也不敢把她怎麼樣。</p>
<p>如今麗華不能像從前在北京時那樣閒散了。從前，她晚上唱戲，白大還可以看看書；作作針線；如今，她晚上唱戲；白天就得今兒到這個乾爸爸家；朋兒到那個乾爸爸家；簡直沒有了她自已的生活！她常常羨慕麗雲，麗雲依然很快活，雖然沒有人捧她，她也不需要。她一直天眞爛漫地把唱戲當作玩兒。她是在「玩」戲，不像麗華，一直感到自已是在被玩，自已便是人家的一件玩物。所以，麗華痛苦，麗雲不痛苦！</p>
<p>麗華的乾爸爸都是五十歲左右的老頭兒，不是官，便是商賈。其中只有一個比較年靑的，四十歲上下。她是駐守徐州的西北軍的一個旅長。有錢，有勢，有許多太太。別的乾爸爸們，拜過之後，又都拜見了乾媽。因爲麗華生得標緻，乾媽們也多很喜歡她，因此還算太平。自然乾媽不在旁邊的時候、乾爸爸就不免放肆起來，偸偸摸摸地抱抱麗華，和麗華胡鬧一陣子。但總還有點分寸。只有這位旅長乾爸爸，他却從來不曾把麗華介紹給他的太太，麗華也從來不知道她還有個乾媽存在。而且他比別人更放肆，更動手動脚的沒個分寸。</p>

<h3>The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Has Been Repaired and Is Open to Traffic; Before the Chen Kaixuan Express Train Derailed; Suspicious People Were Seen Wandering Around</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 11th Dispatch] After the Kaixuan Express train derailed in Zhoujing Lane on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway on the 10th, the Railway Bureau sent personnel to repair it, and it was officially opened to traffic at 2:55 PM on the 11th. However, the sections of the Xin-Hu, Xin-Chang, and other local trains have been suspended. All shifts can resume as usual from the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The tracks of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway in Zhoujing Lane, Wuxi, have been repaired by personnel sent by the two railway bureaus after the second Kaixuan Express train derailed and was damaged on the 10th. All repairs were completed at 2:50 AM on the 11th. At 7:00 AM on the 11th, the Kaixuan Express train departed from Shanghai North Station as usual. The other regular passenger and freight trains also operated as usual, and everything has returned to normal. Hou Huahua, deputy director of the two railway bureaus, told reporters: The situation of this derailment and the degree of damage to the road surface are the only ones seen since the victory. When he received the accident report, he rushed to the scene of the accident by gasoline car to investigate. He discovered: (1) The steel rails were not broken; (2) The locomotive and passenger car wheel axles were not broken; (3) All locomotive and vehicle chassis were intact; (4) All fishplates on the tracks were not split. Based on the above points, it can be proved that this derailment was not due to technical negligence. According to other sources, the tracks at the scene of the Zhoujing Lane accident are straight lines. Even if the foundation is not solid due to heavy rain, at most the train will derail, and it will never overturn. Moreover, after investigation and inspection, there is no sign of roadbed collapse. Therefore, this incident was obviously caused by removing the rail spikes. Especially at 5:00 AM, a passenger train passed by and no accident occurred. Even if the speed is different, it will not lead to such a big accident. Therefore, the railway bureau is collecting information and stepping up investigation.</p>
<p>It is also learned that government senior officials on the Nanjing-Shanghai Road often take the Kaixuan Express train because it is fast and punctual. Therefore, this derailment incident was a planned sabotage by the Communist Party. It is said that on the eve of the accident, a group of suspicious people were seen wandering near the scene of the accident.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Accusations Against the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration: I Issue an Important Statement. Distribution of Relief Supplies is Based on Need, But Difficulties Naturally Arise Due to Transportation Damage.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the accusations against the Chinese government and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), the Chinese government spokesperson issued the following statement today: It is recalled that in May of this year, the Director-General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was dissatisfied with the work of the UNRRA China Office. Consequently, the Director of the China Office, Mr. Casse, and the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Olmstead, were dismissed, and Mr. Lai was appointed as acting director. General Rooks, representative of Mr. LaGuardia, explained to the Chinese government that Mr. Lai's appointment was temporary and that a person of even greater prestige would be sought as the permanent director. Mr. Edison, former Governor of New Jersey, was also considered as a candidate. The Chinese government, recognizing the heavy responsibilities of this position, requested that the permanent director be appointed as soon as possible. The most noticeable impact of the personnel changes was a sudden reduction in the relief supplies distributed from Shanghai to the interior. Before the personnel changes, approximately 25,000 to 30,000 tons of supplies were distributed each week. The transportation of supplies to various locations was faster than the arrival of supplies in Shanghai. Subsequently, in a period of eight weeks, only 111,000 tons of supplies were distributed, averaging less than 15,000 tons per week. Within the second week of June, the amount shipped out of Shanghai dropped to as low as 3,500 tons. Currently, the amount shipped out is not as fast as the amount arriving in Shanghai. Accusers also claim that CRRRA did not fairly distribute UNRRA supplies to the Chinese Communist Party. CRRRA's distribution of supplies is overseen by Director-General Chiang Ting-fu, with UNRRA monitors assisting. Director-General Chiang is instructed by the Chinese government to distribute supplies fairly based on need. The Chinese government's policy for distributing relief supplies is based on need and has no other political considerations. However, difficulties naturally arise in implementing this policy due to transportation damage. As for the allegation that the government has not allocated the promised funds to CRRRA, I can state definitively that the original CRRRA budget was 450,000,000,000 yuan, and the government has already allocated it. Furthermore, because UNRRA supplies did not arrive on schedule and the amount of cotton shipped by UNRRA was less than originally planned, the Central Bank has lent CRRRA an additional 35,000,000,000 yuan in national currency. Due to congestion at the Shanghai docks, the time for transporting supplies to the interior has been delayed. UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia requested that the Chinese government send representatives to discuss reorganizing CRRRA with UNRRA representatives to create a more efficient implementing agency. The meeting was originally scheduled for last Thursday, but it was postponed to this Saturday because the UNRRA representative in China had not yet received authorization from Director-General LaGuardia. It is said that Mr. Lai (Director of the China Office) traveled to Peiping after his wedding, and the meeting will have to be postponed again. Director-General LaGuardia's suspension of some relief supplies to China initially gave the impression that this was a political action, but it was actually due to congestion in Shanghai ports. According to reports, fourteen ships have arrived outside the port, waiting for dock space. Director-General LaGuardia sent a telegram to Premier Soong, which was forwarded by Mr. Lai (Director of the China Office), which can clarify the truth. The telegram reads as follows: "Director-General LaGuardia instructs that, except for food, the shipment of relief supplies to China should be stopped immediately. Ships already en route are not subject to this restriction. The reason is that China has failed to distribute quickly. LaGuardia stated in a telegram to Chairman Chiang on June 7 that the continued shipment of essential food must be supervised and certified by the China Office." After receiving this, CRRRA immediately distributed it to the China Office's headquarters in the interior and to various districts, which will continue to make their best efforts to help CRRRA improve the distribution situation, so that supplies are distributed to the end consumer, so that existing items are cleared out and the UNRRA China Office has normal reasons in financial, transportation, and political areas to make recommendations. According to the original supply plan, we will continue to assist China. Our arduous work is just beginning. I believe that all my colleagues at UNRRA will overcome all difficulties, redouble their efforts, and complete this plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The Chinese Embassy in the United States stated today that the report sent to Director-General LaGuardia by UNRRA China Office staff is clearly one-sided, and it is unwise to draw conclusions based on it. The obstruction of UNRRA relief supplies is affected by transportation difficulties. After a long period of resistance against Japan, it is normal for transportation in China to be difficult to recover for a time. After the Chinese authorities issue a detailed statement, the public will be able to gain a more accurate understanding of the situation.</p>
<h3>CRRRA Has Not Yet Received Official Notice. Director-General Chiang Will Host a Press Conference Today.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A spokesperson for CRRRA stated: "Since UNRRA announced the suspension of the shipment of certain relief supplies to China, it has attracted great attention from all parties. However, the agency has not yet received official notification. CRRRA's attitude will only be revealed at 3:00 PM today when Director-General Chiang hosts a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Capital Hotel."</p>
<p>Chiang Has Already Expressed Three Points</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chiang has already expressed his views, stating briefly: (1) He deeply doubts whether LaGuardia has the authority to take this unilateral action without the UNRRA Council; (2) Some of the equipment received by CRRRA is not suitable for our country's needs, and the suspended supplies may refer to this equipment; (3) The percentage of supplies received by the Communist Party is not insignificant. The Communist areas do not lack food, and the Communist authorities have even expressed their willingness to exchange food from the Communist areas for the supplies they need, but UNRRA provides very few of these supplies, such as cloth, hand-cranked spinning wheels, and medical supplies. The Communist Party has received a considerable amount of medicine, and CRRRA has even purchased medicine in China specifically for their use; (4) Mr. Chiang declined to comment on the UNRRA staff's complaints to the Director-General, but pointed out that this incident occurred at a time when CRRRA was intensifying its relief efforts in the Communist areas, such as establishing an office in Yantai and intensifying relief efforts in the Yellow River disaster area in southern Shandong. CRRRA also sent 180 trucks specifically for transportation, but transportation is indeed extremely difficult, and some areas have no means of transportation at all; (5) Although there have been some obstacles to the transportation of supplies recently, most of the difficulties have been resolved after CRRRA's negotiations.</p>
<h3>A Major Bandit Den Was Broken Up in Hangzhou: More Than a Month of Diligent Investigation Leads to the Arrest of Fourteen Bandits</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 11th] Regarding the case of a civilian boat being robbed near Haiyue Bridge in Jianggan last month, resulting in the loss of 700,000 yuan in cash and a large amount of jewelry, as well as the kidnapping of hostages Yu Jiaju and Qian Xialin, the Provincial Capital Investigation Team, after receiving the report, dispatched a large number of officers to investigate extensively. After a week, on June 27, the team, together with the Hang County Investigation Team, discovered two people in the Guanyintang area of Xinqiao. After detailed questioning, they revealed information related to the case. After being taken to Hangzhou, the bandits, fearing exposure, released the hostages. Not long after, the gang of bandits made new plans, coming to Hangzhou in succession and hiding in various locations, including No. 13 Tai Miao Alley, Dadong Hotel on Dongpo Road, No. 35 Changguan Lane on University Road, and No. 2 Yilong, Qiafengli on Jiangjun Road, actively preparing to commit more crimes, totaling more than a dozen cases. After the team learned of this, they secretly discussed with Wu Rongzhao, the head of the Hang County Investigation Team, dispatching detectives to infiltrate the bandit den to gather information, and ordering their subordinates to closely monitor them and follow them individually. On the 28th of last month, the bandits again planned to rob the Shanghai-Hangzhou gasoline train and a certain bank in Hangzhou. Seeing that the time was ripe, the team mobilized all detectives and captured three bandits, Zhang Guicheng (alias Zhou Zhongchi), Yang Chunxian, and Tong Chunxi, by the West Lake and in tour boats. Then, they focused all their efforts on the remaining bandits' hiding places, hoping to wipe them out completely. At that time, it was learned that the bandit Zhao Yongcai was hiding in a certain unit in Tai Miao Alley. Because the team had limited manpower and no means of transportation, they contacted the police station in charge to send armed police officers to implement traffic control in the vicinity, while sending others to arrest the remaining criminals elsewhere. After midnight, the bandit Zhao sneaked out, intending to escape, and was caught by the police officers there, resulting in a fight. He eventually escaped, and the police officers, in their eagerness, fired shots in the direction of Chenghuang Mountain to pursue him. The bandit returned fire several times before fleeing up the mountain. After the investigation team learned of this, they dispatched police dogs to cooperate with some forces to search and arrest everywhere, and went directly to University Road where Zhao had hidden. When the detectives sneaked upstairs, they heard the sound of tiles on the roof. The detectives knew that something was wrong and surrounded the house while climbing onto the roof to pursue the bandit. The bandit ran anxiously on the roof, slipped, and was captured. At this time, the east was about to dawn, so they took swift action to arrest the bandits one by one under the guidance of the detectives, totaling fourteen male and female bandits, including Lu Bin, Xu Wenying, Yu Agui, Wang Hengxin, Li Junming, Liu Qiming, Tong Chunxi, Yang Chunxian, Zhang Guicheng, and Zhao Yongcai. It was found that this gang of bandits was numerous, powerful, well-organized, and ruthless. The victims were countless. The people of the city were overjoyed upon hearing the news. However, the remaining criminals have fled to Shanghai, and there is still a risk of more trouble.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Can Avoid Flooding</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper in Hankou, 11th) The water level is only one meter away from the lowest point in Hankou City. Based on past trends, it could reach the highest water level in twenty years in less than a week. However, according to a telegram from Wanxian, Chongqing, the water level in Chongqing has dropped by two meters, and Wanxian has also dropped by one meter. Therefore, after Wuhan receives the floodwater that is still flowing in the Sha and Jianli areas, the water level is likely to drop. If the weather continues to be sunny, flooding may be avoided.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Warmongers Have Reached the Point of Drawing Their Daggers!</h3>
<p>These days, the overall situation in China feels like "a storm is brewing, the wind fills the tower!" The warmongers seem to have reached the stage of drawing their daggers. The appointment of Stuart as the new ambassador, while generally hoped to facilitate our negotiations, has been met with an unusually somber political atmosphere. The Five-Man Conference produced no results, and the Three-Man Conference is unlikely to convene. Following the CCP's "July 7th" declaration, the drums of the propaganda war are beating louder than before. The CCP's ten field army commanders have been appointed, and in addition to the army, there is also an air force commander. After "ascending the altar and conferring commands," the Communist army seems determined to launch a full-scale offensive.</p>
<p>Looking up, the situation is like the summer weather, with dark clouds gathering from all directions: In northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is besieging Liuhe and pressing Yangzhou, and the county seat of Haimen is also in imminent danger; in southern Tianjin, the Communist army has broken into Qing County, occupied Fenghuadian, and invaded Cang County; in central Shandong, the Communist army is attacking Gaotang, and Communist army commander Chen Yi has refused to meet with General Wang Yaowu, and is still attempting to land in Qingdao; between Henan and Hubei, the Communist army is attacking Yicheng, Xinye, Tangyin, and Wuling, and a force is attempting to cross into Laohekou. The Canton-Hankou train derailed between Changsha and Hengyang, and the early morning "Triumph" express train on the Peking-Shanghai Railway derailed and overturned later. Even Communist guerrillas are active in the Nanjing area, and once even approached Danyang. This shows that the Communist army's large-scale sabotage and harassment is becoming increasingly intense and pressing. It's as if the weather is extremely hot and humid, and a torrential downpour may come at any moment with a clap of thunder!</p>
<p>Such is the intent of the warmongers. No matter how much the government compromises and tolerates, it may not be able to satisfy their desires. No matter how fairly Special Envoy Marshall mediates, he may not gain their respect. In the minds of the warmongers, what do they care about the country or the nation? In the ten months since the victory, their attitude towards negotiations has been soft and hard at times, close and distant, seemingly continuous and then interrupted. Initially, they planned to be soft enough to avoid a resolution and hard enough to avoid a rupture. In short, they are intent on "dragging things out," dragging things out until they believe it is advantageous to themselves, and then drawing their daggers and engaging in a "full-scale martial performance" with pleasure.</p>
<p>They sing democracy in their mouths, but in fact, they are the least likely to believe in democracy. They sing peace in their mouths, but in fact, they are the least likely to enjoy peace. They sing unity in their mouths, but in fact, they are the least likely to want to see China unified. Under this premise of hypocrisy, the warmongers believe that the most advantageous way for them is to "fight" when they can fight, and "talk" when they can't fight temporarily. Thus, "talking and fighting" has become their secret, and it is this secret that has misled the country and harmed the people.</p>
<p>The rights and wrongs are clear. The common people only need to think: At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist army had only 45,000 people. In the thirty-third year, the Communist army requested to be reorganized into 16 divisions. When negotiations began last year, the Communist army requested to be reorganized into 16 armies, or 48 divisions, 16 times more than at the beginning, and now it is estimated to have 800,000 people. The area occupied by the Communist army was 74 counties before the Japanese surrender, and then occupied 241 counties by January 13 of this year. After the ceasefire order, it occupied another 22 counties, for a total of 337 counties. Just looking at these two facts, not to mention others, who is expanding their army and seizing land should be indisputable. The common people all hope to reduce the size of the military, and the Allied nations are also determined to assist us in reorganizing the military, but the warmongers are recruiting soldiers and buying horses. The common people all hope for national unity and peaceful construction, but the warmongers are fighting for cities and seizing land, killing people everywhere. This is clearly being hostile to the common people, clearly trying to disgrace the country, and weaken the country's international standing.</p>
<p>Why are these warmongers so unscrupulous in harming the country and the people? Because the CCP has two weapons it is using: one is "anti-American" propaganda that is coordinated with the international situation; and the other is the slogan of "anti-civil war" that deceives short-sighted people. With the weapon of "anti-American" propaganda, the CCP can scare its American allies, making them afraid to make a real judgment, so they can only appease the CCP's warmongers and not mention how to impose sanctions after mediation fails. With the weapon of "anti-American" propaganda, they can create a vague impression in the United States, with the help of "American communists," as if the Chinese people really want to "oppose America," so they can step up their advocacy of "American troops withdrawing from China," which will facilitate their future all-out war. With the slogan weapon of "anti-civil war," the CCP can hide behind the shield of "anti-civil war," only allowing them to shoot at the National Army, but not allowing the National Army to fight back. In other words, by using this slogan of "anti-civil war," the CCP can make the National Army disarm itself first, and then allow them to fight as they please. Clearly they are provoking and hitting people, but they first shout to the neighbors not to fight. This is truly an extremely clever tactic. For example, a robber breaks into a house, already holding a gun, but shouts to the neighbors to prevent the victim from shooting back in self-defense. How brilliant is this? There are even those who call themselves third parties, who ignore justice and fairness, and only know how to shout from the sidelines, "Don't shoot," but do not jointly stop the robbery. In such a strange situation, the CCP's warmongers will naturally be unscrupulous.</p>
<p>Some people who advocate anti-Americanism say that the United States seemed to be "adding fuel" and "putting out the fire" at the same time in the past, and in the future, they hope that the United States will only put out the fire and not add fuel. This statement sounds very pleasant on the surface. But putting out the fire also requires tools. Without cars, machines, belts, fire hoses, etc., putting out the fire is just empty talk. Mozi was extremely enthusiastic about non-aggression, but he sometimes had to help a country defend its city in order to achieve the goal of ending the war. Can we say that Mozi is adding fuel rather than putting out the fire when he uses tools to help defend the city? To be honest, today the CCP is intent on taking the offensive, but the government is only defending. If those who are putting out the fire cannot help those who are defending to stop the force of the attack, the fire cannot be put out. We are very ashamed that the fire in China still needs Americans to help put out! But we should be even more disgusted with those in China who are intent on setting fires! This newspaper has long reminded everyone to put out the sparks quickly, and now it is even later. Today, the overall situation in China is no longer a small spark, but has become a prairie fire. Put out the fire quickly, put out the fire quickly! Do not wait until everything is burned down!</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Throwing a rat, one must avoid breaking the utensils." Generally speaking, those who intentionally or unintentionally condoned the CCP, leading to today's prairie fire, are all holding the psychological disorder of "throwing a rat, one must avoid breaking the utensils." But today the rat is not thrown away, and the utensils are also on the verge of being destroyed. The time is critical! The warmongers have already reached the point of drawing their daggers. Do those who bear the heavy responsibility for the overall situation of the country still want to drag things out?</p>
<h3>Correspondences from Various Places: The Case of the Hang County Gang Extortion of Banks and Pawnshops Has Been Tried and a Date Has Been Set for Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Correspondent] The Hang County District Court held a hearing at 10:00 AM on the previous day to try the case of Mao Sikai, Chief of the Fourth Section of the Zhejiang Office of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau, and Pan Shangyuan, an accountant in Hangzhou, who colluded to extort money from various banks and pawnshops under the puppet regime. The victims, Feng Xingchu, Manager of Detai Pawnshop, and Jiang Gaoquan, President of Jiangnan Commercial Bank, the witness, Accountant Zhou Lian, and the defendants in custody, Mao Sikai and Pan Shangyuan, were all present in court on time. Chief Judge Wang Tongqian explored the statements of the various parties in the case and the circumstances of the trial as follows. Feng Xingchu testified: "My testimony is largely the same as before, but I said that although I initially asked Accountant Zhou Lian to liquidate the assets, I was told by colleagues that it would be easier to settle the matter if I asked Accountant Pan Shangyuan to do so, so I changed to Accountant Pan. I paid a total of 2.5 million yuan in fees and 200,000 yuan in handling fees, but there were no receipts." Accountant Zhou Lian testified: "I did handle the liquidation for Detai and was responsible for stamping the final accounts reported to the Enemy and Puppet Bureau. As for how to quickly settle the matter later, I have not heard anything." Jiang Gaoquan testified: "I also said that I was extorted 2.1 million yuan in public fees, and I said that I saw Mao Sikai sitting in Pan Shangyuan's office, and I was quite flustered at the time." When Mao Sikai and Pan Shangyuan were questioned in court, Mao and Pan both denied it outright. Pan Shangyuan also pointed out that his office staff, Pan Yunzhong, witnessed someone named Zhou come to the office a few days before the incident (around May 25 or 26) and said that the purpose of the complaint was to overthrow the Enemy and Puppet Bureau, and that he had no choice but to involve you (referring to Pan) and felt deeply sorry. As for the collection of public fees, although it seemed excessive, there was no fixed amount, etc. Subsequently, the defense lawyers for the defendants Pan Shangyuan, Chen Zhongda and Jiang Shaotang, and the defense lawyers for Mao Sikai, Zhou Liang and Zheng Zhen, stood up one after another to argue the defense. The court ordered: "Although there is no direct evidence in this case, the statements of the complainants are all based on evidence, and it can be known that they are not fabricated to add to the crime. The sentence will be pronounced on the 15th." Pan Shangyuan's request to be released on bail was denied.</p>

<h3>Five Foreign Ministers Receive Formal Notification: China is a Convening Nation for the European Peace Conference, with the Five Powers Rotating as Chair</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The French Foreign Ministry today notified Mr. Qian Tai, our ambassador, that the four foreign ministers decided on the 9th that the chairmanship of the peace conference will be rotated among the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. (Note: Originally, Soviet Commissioner Molotov wanted to reject China as an invited nation to the peace conference. However, after our government argued with reason, coupled with pressure from international opinion, he abandoned his stubborn attitude. This was seen in yesterday's London broadcast report.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] This morning, French Ambassador Mérieux visited Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the French Foreign Minister's notification. The notification stated that the Paris Peace Conference was being convened in the name of the foreign ministers' conference, and therefore the conference must be convened in the name of the full meeting of the five foreign ministers. Minister Wang agreed to reply after reporting to the government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 11th Broadcast: After Soviet Foreign Minister Inolotov published the Blue Book on German policy, the four foreign ministers held another meeting at 4 PM today to discuss it. It is expected to be resolved satisfactorily. The four foreign ministers' meeting will end this weekend. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are scheduled to leave here and return to their countries on Saturday.</p>
<p>Inolotov Often Speaks to Clarify German Policy</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers' conference continued to meet, and expressed their opinions on the German question. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault said that the four powers must reach an agreement on completely disarming Germany, eliminating Nazism, promoting democracy, and compensating for war damages. In addition, it is necessary to increase German coal production and delineate the western border of Germany. Regarding the border issue, France's attitude has not changed. Regarding the economic unification of Germany, although France temporarily agrees, France's original attitude regarding the separation of certain regions of Germany remains unchanged.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Bevin said that it is necessary to eradicate Nazi ideology and Prussian militarism. The 25-year plan proposed by the United States is sufficient to achieve the above goals and can be accepted. Bevin also said that although long-term occupation of Germany is necessary, it is unacceptable for the four occupation zones to be isolated from each other and not communicate.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said that the representatives of the countries seemed to have unanimously agreed on the economic unification of Germany, which was a principle decided a year ago, but today's Germany is still divided into four occupation zones, which is going in the opposite direction. He proposed the establishment of a special committee to be responsible for studying the German problem. Regarding this point, the representatives of the United Kingdom and France expressed their agreement, while Molotov requested that it be considered at length.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said that France's desire to increase German coal production is acceptable, the organization of the occupation zones of the countries must be improved, and the disarmament of Germany must be thoroughly implemented, which can also be agreed to. However, it is inappropriate to economically destroy Germany or make it an agricultural country, which would threaten the entire world economy. Germany without the Ruhr area cannot become an independent country. Politically, Germany should not become a federal state, and no part of its territory can be divided without the consent of the German people. In this way, the Ruhr area can be jointly managed internationally, but it cannot be separated from Germany.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 10th Dispatch] Molotov delivered a lengthy speech at today's four foreign ministers' meeting, clarifying his policy towards Germany. He declared that the Soviet Union cannot agree to any destruction of the entire German or making Germany an agricultural nation. Molotov said, "The time has come for us to discuss the fate of Germany and the treaty with Germany. The Soviet government has always believed that it is unwise to think of revenge when dealing with such issues. Although the German people cannot shirk their responsibility for Germany's aggression, it is also a fact that Hitler's Germany and the German people cannot be considered as one. The German army invaded the Soviet border, and the Soviet people suffered great misfortune. Our losses are incalculable. Other people in Europe and people in Africa also suffered great losses and pain due to Germany's aggression. Based on this, the question of Germany's fate is not only a concern for the German people, but also for the people of all countries who hope to prevent any future German aggression. The reason is obvious. At the same time, we must not forget that Germany once used its industrial strength to form an important part of the international economic system, but on the other hand, people must not forget that it was this industrial strength that made it possible for Germany to launch aggression. All this is true. At this moment, I begin to assume a theory, that is, from the point of view of European international economy and order, to carry out the annihilation of Germany, so that it will no longer become a country, and to turn Germany into an agricultural country by destroying its industrial center. All this is not right. This action will damage the European economy and disintegrate the international economy. Germany will therefore face political dangers, such as the gradual spread of human diseases, which will eventually become a threat to peace and security. I believe that even if we adopt this policy, history will force us to abandon it in the future, because this policy is not practical and its position is not correct. Therefore, in my opinion, our task is not to eliminate Germany, but to make it a peaceful and democratic country, but to deprive it of all economic and military possibilities, so as not to raise a tiger and cause trouble again and become a country of aggression."</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Takes Over German Property in Austria: The United Kingdom and the United States Jointly Protest, Using Two Documents to Negotiate with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The British Foreign Ministry stated today that the United Kingdom and General Clark of the United States have filed a joint protest against the Soviet Union's plan to take over German property in Austria. This is only an initial response. The British side will not limit itself to just filing a protest. Whether to take further action in Vienna or wait for the four foreign ministers' conference to discuss the Austrian issue before deciding on measures has not yet been determined. But it is expected that Bevin will directly mention this to Molotov today. The United Kingdom will now cite two documents, one is the London Declaration signed on January 6, 1943, by the sixteen warring nations, which stipulates that the Allied countries, including the Soviet Union, cannot recognize the transfer of property in the German-occupied territories as valid. The second is the Moscow Declaration of November 1, 1943, which does not recognize the German-Austrian merger and reaffirms the intention of the three countries to promote Austria's independence and reconstruction, and then negotiate with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Axon's Statement</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Acting U.S. Secretary of State Axon declared today that the United States finds it difficult to recognize the Soviet Union's removal of so-called German assets from Austria, unless such actions are in line with U.S. policy. Whether the removal is legal is judged by whether it is a "forced transfer." The so-called "forced transfer" means that the original Austrian industry was forcibly seized by Germany. This industry should still be regarded as Austrian assets and cannot be regarded as German assets, and therefore cannot be confiscated. It is reported that industrial equipment in eastern Austria worth 22 million U.S. dollars, together with other "foreign German assets" in the Soviet military occupation zone, have been taken over by the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Austrian Authorities Express</p>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 10th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl declared at a special meeting of Parliament today that the Soviet Union and other occupying countries only have the right to demand the confiscation of German property in Austria that was legally obtained before the German annexation of Austria in 1938. According to Figl, the Austrian government refuses to recognize as German property any property obtained by Germans after 1938 through political pressure. After Figl finished speaking, the entire parliament applauded.</p>
<p>Germans Do Not Retreat</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 10th] It is heard from reliable sources that after the protests from the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet authorities have agreed to "postpone until after the holidays" the evacuation of Germans in the Soviet military zone of Austria. The meaning of the word "holidays" is still unclear. The temporary settlement for German nationals in the Soviet zone of Vienna has been disbanded.</p>
<h3>The Soviet-Turkish Issue of Security Is Not Resolved, Turkish Troops Demobilize</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 10th] The Turkish official agency "Bird's Post" hinted that the Turkish army will only demobilize the wartime troop levels that were slightly micro-operated at the beginning of the European War after a precise resolution of Soviet-Turkish relations. The newspaper's editorial stated that "We are forced to leave this preparation to defend everyone's freedom. What the Turkish nation and government are uneasy about is the unresolved territorial issues of the Crimean Tatars and the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, which were raised by the Soviet Union. The external threat still exists and cannot be immediately demobilized, which once caused the Balkan countries to attack Turkey."</p>

<h3>The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission's Rules of Procedure are Passed: The Canadian Representative is Allowed to Participate in the Discussion, and the Soviet Representative Fails to Use the Veto Again</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, New York, 10th] The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed the rules of procedure drafted by the Atomic Energy Commission today, so that the commission can follow them when discussing the atomic energy control plan. The Security Council held a heated debate on the issue of the Canadian representative's attendance, and as a result, the Canadian representative was allowed to participate with nine votes in favor and one vote against. The Soviet Union voted against. Canada is not a normal member of the council, but since Canada is a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, it specifically requested to be allowed to participate in the discussion of the atomic energy issue. Soviet Representative Gromyko opposed Canada's request, arguing that this was a new step and advocating a vote. The British and Australian representatives believed that Canada's request was extremely reasonable, because any country, if what is being discussed involves that country, can participate in the council's discussion without going through voting procedures. Regarding this point, the United Nations Charter has clear provisions. At this point, Chairman Najjari (the representative of Mexico) adopted a voting method to decide, and obtained a result of nine votes in favor and one vote against. Poland did not participate in the vote. As a result, the Soviet representative attempted to use the veto power, but was rejected by the chairman. Najjari pointed out that this issue was "procedural" and not "substantive," and the veto power could not be used. Therefore, the Canadian representative continued to sit calmly in his seat, and then the meeting adjourned, scheduled to reconvene on the 17th, with Dutch Representative Kleffens taking over as chairman.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Propaganda Plan for the Invasion of North China Was Submitted to the Far East International Tribunal Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 11th] In 1935, the Japanese Kwantung Army actively arranged the work of invading North China. The propaganda plan drawn up by the Kwantung Army at that time was submitted to the International Tribunal yesterday. This plan is found in the report of Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Toshiro Nishio to Japanese Army Vice Minister Ganro Koso on December 9, 1935. It stated that the Kwantung Army's propaganda plan for North China was to make China and foreign countries understand that it was legitimate when the Kwantung Army entered the customs, and to stimulate the North Chinese people's anti-Kuomintang and anti-communist consciousness, and to arouse the anti-war emotions of the Chinese military and civilians in various places. The main propaganda points first falsely claimed that North China was a colony of the National Government, and that the North Chinese people were eager to break away from its shackles and establish an autonomous government. It also happened that the National Government nationalized silver, which aroused resentment among the North Chinese people, and the movement to establish an autonomous government was able to develop rapidly. It also claimed that the National Government had undermined the North China Truce Agreement, aroused anti-Japanese sentiment, disturbed "Manchukuo," and threatened Japanese interests and the lives of Japanese expatriates in North China. Therefore, it was necessary to seek understanding from China and foreign countries that Japan would resort to force when it was unavoidable.</p>

<h3>Old Fox Chang Yuqing, Spouting Nonsense with a Terrible Attitude, Refusing to Tell the Truth About His Evil Deeds</h3>
<p>He stubbornly denied the crimes he committed and flatly refused to admit them. He continued to play deaf and dumb during the retrial yesterday afternoon, denying that he was the head of the "Huangdao Society" and denying any involvement in murder. When an official was sent to inform him that all newspapers in the 27th year of the Republic had reported it, Chang cunningly argued that he had offended the press in the 16th year of the Republic when Mei Lanfang performed and he did not entertain them properly. Therefore, the news media harbored hatred towards him. He claimed that news reporters had no material and that was why they came after him. He also claimed that he was a devout Buddhist who did not know a single letter. From the first year of the Republic to the present, he has not touched alcohol or tobacco, nor even killed a chicken. How could he possibly kill people? He had no grudges against them, and he was not insane, so why would he want to kill them? Killing and arson require concrete evidence, and people should be brought to court to testify. Newspaper reports are unreliable because newspapers once said that he was dead. But he is still alive. He asked the judge: "Are you trying to force me to admit to murder? Was I an official or did I become rich at the time?" Because Chang stubbornly denied the charges, the judge was helpless. After repeated questioning, Chang vaguely stated that the "Huangdao Society" was led by Chen Qun, and the head was a Japanese man named Takahashi. However, he still refused to reveal the number of his followers, the fabrication of terrorist incidents, etc. Finally, the court brought Huang Fusen, a former Chinese detective from the Public Concession Police Department who had been sentenced to two and a half years in prison, from prison to testify. Huang stated that many of the terrorist cases in the concession in the 27th year of the Republic were committed by the "Huangdao Society," but he said that he had only heard rumors about whether Chang Yuqing was the head, and he did not know the actual situation. The case still needs to be investigated in court, so the court adjourned it for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Cai Pei Re-Tried, Claims Serving in Puppet Positions Was to Save the People</h3>
<p>Cai Pei, who once served as a puppet ambassador to Japan and the puppet mayor of Nanjing, was retried in the High Court yesterday. Cai argued that all newspapers and publications at the time were controlled by the enemy and puppet regime. It was common for them to arbitrarily add or subtract content under false names. The propaganda department of the puppet regime was accustomed to writing articles under false names. In the harsh environment at the time, it was impossible to make corrections. "One cannot keep one's name in one's pocket and prevent others from using it; please, Your Honor, understand this." During his tenure as the mayor of Nanjing, he negotiated with the Japanese troops stationed at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to withdraw, subsequently reorganized the area, and organized a guard to protect it. Throughout history, those who protect the mausoleum have performed great service, and this was his greatest act of loyalty to the Premier. While holding puppet positions, he contacted Xu Mingcheng, a special commissioner of the Southeast District of the Central Military Affairs Department, and provided intelligence. He also rescued arrested underground workers, including Ma Yuanfang, director of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee; Yu Hong, head of the General Affairs Section of the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League; and Wang Wenjun, a comrade from the Accounting Office of the Second Guerrilla Zone Command of the Third War Area. He insisted that he took the puppet positions because of the harsh environment and did so without seeking fame or fortune but to save the people and asked the court for forgiveness. Deng Jiecun, Yu Pangrong, Wang Wenjun, and others appeared in court to provide favorable testimony. Cai also hired lawyer Yu Cunxiu to defend him. The case was said to have concluded its debate and is scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 18th at 9:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Sentences Handed Down to Three Traitors, Liang Shi Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months</h3>

(2) Chu Lingsun, president of the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital under the puppet regime, was sentenced to one year and three months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. (3) Yu Peng, a police officer in the Suzhou Police Bureau under the puppet regime, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. All property of the convicts was confiscated, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of their families.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cases of Zhang Guanfu and Xu Jinqing, who were suspected of being traitors, were found to lack conclusive evidence of collaboration with the enemy. However, they were found to have violated ordinary laws, so the court announced yesterday that jurisdiction in the matter was erroneous and the case would be transferred to the local court.</p>
<h3>Two Murderers of Patriots, Russian Secret Agents Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Tao brothers, Russians, served as secret agents for No. 76 during the enemy-puppet period. In July of the 29th year of the Republic, they led the Second Brigade of Special Agents to capture Chen Sancai, a patriotic youth, and sent him to Nanjing, where he was soon killed. During the trial in the High Court yesterday, Chen's comrade Tang Huiyu appeared in court to testify unequivocally. He stated that the two Russians were involved in terrorist incidents such as the machine-gun shooting at the Great America Evening News and the bombing of the Farmers' Bank. However, the defendants both flatly denied the charges. The case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>On the same day, the cases of Ye Yaoguang, chief of the Document Section of the Puppet Special Agents Headquarters, Zhou Wenrui, director of the Puppet Inland River Steamship Company, and Shen Xiaoyan, a cultural traitor, were also heard.

After the victory, Zhao Yuee, the victim's wife, reported the case to the Third Theater of Operations, which arrested the defendants. Yesterday morning, Zhang Shishan, who was arrested at the same time as Lu Xiangsheng and later released, appeared in court to testify that he had indeed been beaten by Maruyama Masato. However, both defendants denied the charges. The court ordered that the case still needs to be investigated for evidence and adjourned for another hearing.</p>

The meeting was chaired by Mrs. Yang Aifang, the wife of President Ling Xianyang, who reported on the motive for convening the meeting: (1) Due to the disruption of transportation since the Anti-Japanese War, there was a loss of contact between the various associations, so this opportunity was used to allow the association and the city associations to exchange opinions, review the past, and plan for the future.

<p>Afterwards, the participants collectively participated in spiritual practice, and Mayor Wu's wife read a verse from the Bible.

The investigation is proceeding actively, but it may not be possible to solve the case in the short term. The reporter asked: "In your opinion, are these counterfeit dollars made by Chinese or foreigners?" Mr. Bu Luojin laughed repeatedly and replied: "Foreigners! Foreigners!

<h3>Conflict on the Bus, A Terrible Brawl, Streetcars in Yangshupu All Stopped Last Night</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A B79 streetcar on the No. 8 route from the Bund to Yangshupu was traveling on Broadway Road at approximately 6:00 PM last night when Zhou Yingqian, Yang Shiqing, and Chen Mingzhou, three mechanics from the 25th Motor Vehicle Squadron of the Aviation Committee, got into a dispute with Ni Yubiao, the ticket seller of the B2347 car, over ticket purchase. The conflict escalated into a fight, and the car stopped. Before long, more than twenty streetcars were blocked there. All the drivers and ticket sellers stopped their cars and joined the fight, and other soldiers from the army and navy on the car also participated. As a result, several people on both sides were injured. The Hudong Military Police arrived and made every effort to suppress the disturbance and bring it to an end. At approximately 7:00 PM, the vehicles stopped at that location were all driven back to the Yangshupu car factory and had not been dispatched by late evening. At the time of the incident, a soldier named Yang Shukai from the Aviation Committee's equipment warehouse was seriously injured in the ribs and was sent to Public Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the Aviation Committee believes that the soldier was not a passenger on the bus and was seriously injured for no reason. They will report the facts to the Garrison Command and other relevant agencies and intend to file a lawsuit.

<h3>Director Wu, Chief Secretary of the National Resources Commission, Inspects Various Institutions in Shanghai; Discusses in Detail the Establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation; Hopes Sugar Merchants Cooperate to Stabilize Market Prices</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhaohong, Chief Secretary of the National Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, arrived in Shanghai from the capital two days ago to inspect the affiliated institutions in Shanghai and investigate market conditions for reporting to the central government. A reporter from the Central News Agency noted the recent rise in sugar prices, which has attracted general attention and led to criticism of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's handling of affairs. As the corporation is directly under the National Resources Commission, the reporter specifically sought Mr. Wu's opinion on matters related to Taiwan Sugar. Mr. Wu provided the following information: "The National Resources Commission has always valued the interests of the people in managing state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. It also adopts an attitude of assistance toward similar enterprises run by private individuals, so that state-owned and private enterprises can work hand in hand to promote the overall industrial development of the country. Taiwan's sugar industry has been developed by the Japanese for decades and is quite large in scale, including not only sugar factories but also more than 2,000 kilometers of factory-built railways and a large amount of sugarcane land. However,</p>
<p>during the war, it suffered heavy damage from Allied air raids. Therefore, restoring and managing this enterprise is indeed an arduous task. In April of this year, we were ordered by the Executive Yuan to take over the operation, and with approval, we co-operated with the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office. Because a small number of Taiwanese compatriots had invested in the original enterprise, a joint-stock company was organized. Before the war, there were very few sugar factories in China, and most of the sugar was imported from overseas, costing a considerable amount of foreign exchange each year. Therefore, the most important goal of the sugar company is to restore past production levels in order to meet domestic needs. Therefore, after taking over in May of this year, we immediately began to renovate the factory buildings and equipment, and hired American sugar manufacturing experts to conduct on-site inspections, together with our technical personnel, to develop</p>
<p>a restoration plan. The initial report from the American side has already been submitted, and a large amount of equipment needs to be supplemented from abroad in order to gradually restore the old appearance. In addition, the raw materials in each factory include stored sugar, which the company was ordered by the Executive Yuan to sell. The sale price of this sugar is in accordance with the regulations for dealing with enemy and puppet property. The company remits all proceeds to the national treasury, except for a small amount of miscellaneous expenses. As for the company's sugar sales policy, it was determined by the National Resources Commission at the beginning that, in addition to direct sales to large users, it only engages in wholesale</p>
<p>business, not retail. At a time when various commodity prices are soaring, the National Resources Commission has also paid attention to curbing prices from the beginning. Therefore, it is stipulated that the company's wholesale price must be lower than the market price. Since the company began selling sugar on May 24, each sale price has been lower than the market price, as can be verified by newspaper records. However, if the market price is</p>
<p>pushed up by the market to be much higher than the wholesale price, the company naturally has no reason to sell at the original price. The National Resources Commission's operation of enterprises is not originally for the purpose of making profits, but if the company continues to sell at the original price, on the one hand, the government reduces its income and suffers unnecessary losses, and on the other hand, it does not benefit the general public, but only allows a small number of merchants to obtain excessive profits. Therefore, the Commission instructed the sugar company that future pricing should still maintain a policy of being lower than the market price, and the legitimate interests of legitimate sugar merchants should naturally be protected. It is sincerely hoped that sugar merchants can also take the position of caring for the domestic sugar industry, stabilize market prices, and benefit the general public."</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Wu personally went to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday to inspect the company's recent business conditions and distribution process, inquiring in great detail. Later, he and Mr. Shen Zhennan, the general manager of the company who returned to Shanghai from Taiwan the day before, and Associate Manager Song Yishou visited Mayor Wu to discuss how to curb the rising sugar prices in the future, improve distribution, and popularize it to users, and eliminate the manipulation of illegal merchants. Mr. Wu and Mr. Shen took the night train back to the capital last night. He may come to Shanghai again in two weeks.</p>

<h3>News Figure in the Peking Opera Circle, Ma Lianliang's "Explanation"; Denies Being Sent to the Northeast to Perform for Celebrations; Expresses Doubt About the Court's Arrest Warrant and House Sealing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 9:30 PM, I went to visit Ma Lianliang backstage at the Queen's Grand Theater, and was told that "Master Ma has not yet arrived." At 10:30 PM, I was told that "Master Ma is on stage." The entrance was heavily guarded, and reporters were not allowed in at first, but I was finally let in. Ma Lianliang, dressed in his costume, said to the reporter behind the scenery: "Please wait for me at the Queen's Cafe, and I will come as soon as I get off stage."</p>
<p>At 11:30 PM, I formally met this news figure who has recently caused a sensation in Shanghai, a famous actor, in the Queen's Cafe upstairs. All the newspapers have reported that Ma Lianliang was accused of being a traitor and that the Beiping Higher Court had issued an arrest warrant. Now he is the center of conversation for the general public, but he is still singing charity performances with composure.</p>
<p>"I hope that my friends in the press can understand my situation and give me a fair criticism," Ma Lianliang said very modestly. "I am not saying that I have been wronged, but I want to explain my past performances in Manchukuo."</p>
<p>He focused his energy on this "explanation." He said a lot, and according to his meaning, his trip to Manchukuo to perform was still a righteous act. Ma Lianliang is a Muslim, and the Northeast Islamic Middle School, established by the Islamic Association in Shenyang, was short of funds and invited Ma to perform several charity concerts to raise money. "But the main point is not this," Ma Lianliang said urgently, "There was an performing arts association organized by Japanese rogues such as Itoshima in Manchukuo, and they used this organization to control the performing arts circles in Northeast China. One of the Chinese people worked as their translator, and it is said that this person was Zhu Fuchang, the editor of the Beiping 369 Pictorial. Song, representing the performing arts association, contacted me and said that they would take me to Shenyang to perform, and they would also handle the matter of the Islamic Association inviting me to perform. The organization of the performing arts association was mainly for money, and they used the special power of the Japanese to "protect" the artists who went to the Northeast, taking profits from our salaries. Zhu Fuchang also threatened me with death, and as a result," Master Ma sighed, "I went."</p>
<p>As a result, he went. He performed charity performances in Shenyang for the Islamic Association for twelve days, and then he performed commercial performances for more than twenty days. These twenty days were performed for the "performing arts association" to make profits. Ma Lianliang spoke very pitifully, as if his performances in the Northeast were completely involuntary. At this time, he also brought up some old events, talking about how he pretended to be crazy to escape performing when the puppet government of Eastern Hebei was established before the War of Resistance, and also said that he organized the celebration performances to welcome Chairman Chiang and various officials after the victory. Was he trying to show some merit? Can a truly traitorous person (assuming he is) be exonerated by these merits?</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked him the most important question: What do you think about the fact that the Beiping Higher Court has issued an arrest warrant for you this time?</p>
<p>"I have nothing to say," he said excitedly, "But I don't believe that the news is correct. They said they were going to arrest me, but I have not received any official documents to this day. They said that my house in Beiping has been sealed up, but I have not received a telegram from home to this day. I don't know anything, so I still sing charity performances with peace of mind. If there is an order from above to take me, I will definitely go."</p>
<p>He also said: "I want to make a special statement that I did not go to the Northeast to perform for the puppet government to celebrate their so-called tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. I just happened to catch up. If it was really sent by the puppet government, then the puppet government has a record to check, and I will never shirk responsibility."</p>
<p>He spoke very firmly, as if he were completely innocent, but what is ultimately right or wrong is not the reporter's business. It was late at night when I parted with him. How many people in this quiet night are thinking about the good and evil they have done during the day!</p>

<h3>Impersonation and Extortion; Arrested After Failure</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Qian Xu, a local woman residing at No. 44 Chunggeng Li, Zhongzheng East Road, has a habit of smoking opium, but has not registered with the authorities. The rogue Shi Guoping, along with Hui Shigen, learned of this and conspired with Kang Maodi to extort money. They colluded with Jin Xinzhou and Zong Ziying, two members of a certain agency, and went to Qian Xu's home in Chunggeng Li on the evening of the 7th, claiming to be searching for opium and extorted one million yuan. However, because she did not have much cash, she took out 440,000 yuan as a bribe. During the negotiations, Shi Guoping was unsatisfied with his desires and went to the home of Lu Jilun on the third floor of the same building and seized the opportunity to extort six gold rings and a copper pocket watch. As they were about to escape with the loot, the nearby patrol police officer No. 2010 noticed the flaw and secretly reported it to the Huangpu Branch. Director Du and Section Chief Zhou, along with section members Cao Yijian and police chief Zhao Hairu, rushed to the scene and arrested Zong Ziying, Jin Xinzhou, Kang Maodi, and Qian Xu on the spot. Two guns, bullets, and opium paraphernalia were seized and brought to the bureau for interrogation. However, the two criminals Shi Guoping and Hui Shigen are at large and are currently being pursued.

<h3>Overview of Secondary Education in Xikang; Twenty-Three Secondary Schools in Five Districts of the Province</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Xichang by this newspaper] Xikang is located on the border, and its culture is isolated. Since the establishment of the province in 1938, the attention of the rulers has been aroused, and the establishment of secondary schools has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Originally, the province was divided into four secondary school districts, but now it is divided into five secondary school districts, with at least one provincial secondary school and one county secondary school established in each district. The situation of the secondary schools in each district is briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>The first district includes the twenty-one counties and bureaus of the old Kang area. In this district, there are currently Kangding Provincial High School, Luding High School, and two Luding County junior high schools. Except for Kangding High School, the class sizes of the other two schools are not complete.</p>
<p>The second district includes Yaan, Tianquan, Rongjing, Lushan, and Baoxing counties. Currently, there are Yaan Provincial High School, Yaan Girls' High School, and eight county high schools. Among them, Yaan Provincial High School is more complete, while the class sizes of the other schools are also scattered and incomplete.</p>
<p>The third district includes Hanyuan, Yuejun, and Mianning counties. Currently, there are Hanyuan County High School, Yuejun County High School, Hanyuan Private Yuwen Junior High School, and Mianning County Junior High School. Except for Hanyuan County High School, which has three senior high school classes, coeducational, and three junior high school classes for boys and girls separately, the other schools are coeducational.</p>
<p>The fourth district includes Xichang, Yanyuan, Dechang, Zhaojue, and Ningdong counties and bureaus. Among them, Xichang has the most secondary schools, including Xichang Provincial High School, County High School, County Girls' High School, and Lizhou County Junior High School. Each county and bureau has Dechang County Junior High School, Yanyuan County Junior High School, and Xichang Private Jiansheng Junior High School. Xichang Provincial High School was reorganized from the old Ningyuan Prefecture High School, and it is larger in scale and better equipped. Currently, it has three senior high school classes, coeducational, and six junior high school classes. The class sizes of the County High School are also the same. The other schools are either newly established or have few students, so there are not many achievements to speak of.</p>
<p>The fifth district includes Huili, Yanbian, and Ningnan counties. Except for Huili, which has a county high school with three senior and junior high school classes, the other two counties each have only one junior high school with incomplete class sizes. In total, there are twenty-three secondary schools in the five districts of the province, including four provincial high schools, five county high schools, ten county junior high schools, and four private junior high schools. Among them, except for one or two schools that were established earlier, the rest were established during the War of Resistance, so the equipment, teachers, etc. were affected by the war, and they were simple and crude. Books, instruments, and teacher funding were all meager, which weakened teaching efficiency and lowered student levels. This is a major defect in secondary education in Kang Province. Currently, knowledgeable people in the province are seeking ways to reform. The main points are as follows: (1) Enrich equipment, (2) Adjust school districts, (3) Improve standards, (4) Strengthen management, (5) Strictly select teachers. (Jian)</p>

<h3>Hongkou Swimming Pool Opens Today</h3>
<p>Tickets Sold Upon Presentation of Physical Examination Certificate</p>
<p>The Hongkou Outdoor Swimming Pool, managed by the Municipal Sports Field, has been repaired. It was filled with water on the 6th, and disinfection work was completed by the 9th. It is now scheduled to open today (the 12th), without an opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Opening Hours: Open daily from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Ticket prices approved by the bureau are as follows: (1) Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays: 5,000 yuan regardless of morning or afternoon.

(4) Every Monday, Wednesday morning, members of the military police are invited for free to show special treatment. On all other days, tickets must be purchased at full price.</p>
<p>Physical Examination: Director Zeng repeatedly emphasized to Field Manager Jiang: "Public health is paramount." A lot of money has been spent on pool water disinfection for this reason. Anyone coming to the pool to swim must present a physical examination certificate to purchase a ticket. Members of the military police and students are no exception. This also applies to the days when military police are invited for free. For the convenience of swimmers, the pool recognizes physical examination certificates issued by the Health Bureau, public hospitals, affiliated hospitals of public and private schools, and physicians registered with the Department of Health. Certificates issued by military doctors of the respective military units are also valid, but limited to one certificate per person. A simplified format for the physical examination certificate is as follows: "This is to certify that [Name] has no trachoma, skin disease, infectious disease, or heart disease. – [Hospital Name] [Physician Name] (with seal) [Date]." It is best for each person to use their own business card and have it stamped by the doctor after the examination, then keep it in their wallet for presentation when purchasing tickets. Those without a certificate will be refused tickets. The pool has also engaged doctors to perform examinations. The pool will not issue season passes this season.</p>

The District 18 People's Representative Assembly is scheduled to hold its establishment meeting on the 12th of this month at Chengzhong Middle School on Tangshan Road.</p>
<h3>Emergency Repair of the Yunzaobang Bridge</h3>
<p>The Yunzaobang Bridge, located within the jurisdiction of District 23 (Wusong) of this city, is a vital transportation artery between Wusong and Shanghai. It has been in disrepair for many years and is severely damaged. After the victory, the district office and the Japanese Prisoner Management Office made some repairs, which are barely usable. Recently, since the Songhu Railway has not yet been connected to automobiles, frequent transportation has caused many holes to appear on the bridge surface, and there is a danger of collapse. In view of this, the Wusong Fortress Command and the district office held an emergency meeting on the 8th of this month at the Yong'an Yarn Factory to discuss the emergency repair of the bridge. Military, government, police, and industrial and commercial organizations in Wusong, as well as over twenty groups, initiated the organization of the Yunzaobang Bridge Emergency Repair Committee, which will begin work soon and is expected to be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Registration Period for Self-Defense Firearms Limited to the End of July This Year</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department yesterday received an official letter from the Police Bureau stating: "It has been found that civilian self-defense firearms should be registered with this bureau in accordance with the law, inspected, and licensed. The municipal government issued a notice on this matter last year with Municipal Police Dispatch No. 39. However, registrations received by the bureau are far from enthusiastic, and cases of people committing crimes with firearms are frequently reported. In order to consolidate local security and maintain social stability, it is proposed to launch a widespread propaganda campaign through the Baojia system to report privately held firearms. All unlicensed civilian firearms must be registered with this bureau for licensing before the end of July this year. Those who still conceal them without reporting after the deadline will be prosecuted as possessing military firearms. People without firearms should not consider this matter unrelated to them. They should be aware that the loss of firearms among the people affects their own safety. If unlicensed firearms are found, they should be reported immediately to eliminate the source of chaos." It is reported that the department has instructed all districts to comply with this.</p>
<h3>District Briefs</h3>
<p>The District 1 People's Representative Assembly held its establishment meeting on the morning of the 10th and elected a chairman. It is reported that the assembly is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 15th and 16th of this month.</p>
<p>District 24 District Chief Cheng Jingyuan has been transferred to District 1 as District Chief. Wang Zhiping has been appointed by the municipal government to fill the vacancy. District Chief Wang reported to the district on the 8th of this month.</p>
<p>The District 13 Office previously drafted ten implementation measures for environmental sanitation and submitted them to the Baozhang meeting for approval. It is reported that each Bao is to strictly enforce them starting this month.</p>
<p>District 2 District People's Representative Zhang Zhongyuan wishes to resign from his position as a District People's Representative after being elected as a Municipal Councilor. In addition, Lou Guanghua and Wu Bichao, District People's Representatives from the 25th Bao and 18th Bao of the district, have requested to resign because they serve as assistants and Bao cadres in the district office. The vacancies will be filled by substitute District People's Representatives Ma Qi and others from the respective Baos.</p>
<p>Colleagues from the Baojia system in District 16 are preparing to establish a consumer cooperative. They held a meeting at the district office the other day to discuss the implementation of the matter. District Chief Guo Qixun and Deputy District Chief Mao Dushi attended to provide guidance. The meeting passed the solicitation of shares method and the draft articles of association, and designated Guo Qixun as the director of preparations. It is planned to raise 40 million yuan in shares, and solicitation will begin immediately.</p>

<h3>Remittances from Overseas Chinese Show Significant Progress, Still Limited from Southeast Asia, Difficult to Directly Remit from Continental Europe</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the victory, remittances from overseas Chinese from various places abroad have been restored one after another. However, before March 4 of this year, they were greatly affected due to the low exchange rate. After the new exchange rate was re-established on March 4, the number of remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country gradually increased. And the branches of the Bank of China in various places in Southeast Asia have also gradually resumed operations, making it very convenient for overseas Chinese to remit money back to the country. Moreover, international exchange has also been opened recently, no longer monopolized by the Bank of China. All designated Chinese and foreign banks can handle it. There are more than 30 designated banks including HSBC, Guangdong, Overseas Chinese, and Juxingcheng. In recent months, the number of remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country is the largest from the United States, followed by Southeast Asia. Taking only the Bank of China as an example, the overseas Chinese remittances received by it each month in recent months exceed 500,000 Legal Tender. However, although this number is far better than before the war, the currency value is by no means comparable to that before the war. Therefore, current remittances from overseas Chinese are actually not improved compared with before the war.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of remittances from overseas Chinese in various places in Southeast Asia, because British territories such as the Malay Peninsula are still under control, remittances are subject to restrictions and the number is very limited. As for the Dutch East Indies, because order has not been fully restored and the branches of our national banks in that area have not resumed operations, they are currently stagnant. Burma is also under British control and remittances from overseas Chinese are restricted. Remittances from Siam are transferred through Haiphong, Vietnam, but the Bank of China may soon establish a branch there. At the same time, during the war, some overseas Chinese in Burma and Southeast Asia withdrew and returned to China because they were unwilling to be oppressed by the Japanese. Now they want to return to their original areas, but they are still subject to British entry restrictions, and most of them remain in the country. This is also the reason for the reduction of remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The situation in the Philippines is better, and remittances from overseas Chinese are smooth.</p>
<p>In Europe, the Bank of China has a branch in London, and remittances to other regions are forwarded through London. Germany is still under the joint management of the Allies, and remittances from overseas Chinese are out of the question. In France, the franc exchange rate fluctuates greatly, making it difficult to remit money directly to China. Moreover, there are very few overseas Chinese in Continental Europe, and even fewer businessmen. National banks currently have no intention of establishing branches in Europe again. In fact, if overseas Chinese in Europe need to remit money back to the country, they can find ways to do so with the local consulate or hand it over to the London branch of the Bank of China for handling. According to banking sources: when Guangzhou was lost, the account books of a certain national bank that received remittances from overseas Chinese were unfortunately lost, and some remittances could not be traced. This problem is still an outstanding issue for remittances from overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Fall Again</h3>
<p>After the high point, government bonds gradually felt empty. A major player on the fifth floor, who had been strongly advancing the previous day, partly covered his positions. After Tongbing morning opening, from above 1200, they gradually fell to around 850 yuan. Chaozhou merchants bought a small amount, and at noon they returned to near the 1,000 yuan mark. As a result, compared with the previous closing, it fell 120 yuan. Jia and Yi also fell slightly by 50 yuan, Ding fell by 90 yuan, and Wu rose and fell quickly, falling by 220 yuan.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants' Purchases Drive Up Yarn Prices, American Cotton Soars, Local Cotton Trading Booms</h3>
<p>The yarn market was stable yesterday. Guangdong merchants, who had been watching for several days, gradually began to purchase. Shenxin Third Factory supplied and sold 20 special good yarns, making 5-600 pieces, opening at 1.15 million yuan, payment in two weeks. Anda Yarn Factory offered Special Flying Tiger, priced at 1.22 million. Other large factories also made offers. Overall, the volume of transactions for the day was 2-30,000 yuan better than the previous day. The market seemed to show promise at the close, but it still needs the support of actual sales.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph soared another 98 to 100 pounds, with nearby at US$33.53, distant at US$33.76, and Midtling spot at US$34.19, seemingly an unprecedented high. Local cotton trading is booming, and market prices are becoming more attractive. The Textile Construction Company purchased 3,600 bales of the Midtling brand, while Xin Yuzhen, Xin Jia, and other factories each purchased 3-400 bales.</p>
<h3>Yong Yarn Shares Stand Out in Local Stocks Yesterday, Foreign Stocks Rise Across the Board as Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>In local stocks, a certain industrial company strongly purchased 500,000 shares of Yong Yarn, and large stocks suddenly showed promise, while small stocks were only in a passive position, only improving slightly. Throughout the day, the price was lowest in the early morning and highest at noon. The large stocks were stable in the middle, while the small stocks, due to the issue of listing, had fewer expectations, and no one inquired about them, resulting in a volatile situation. The old stocks were still unable to make progress. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yong Yarn rose 32 yuan, Meiya rose 170 yuan, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by half a percent. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks also rebounded slightly, while the veteran stocks did not advance but retreated.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were in more demand than supply yesterday, and the price rebounded sharply. Yisha opened in the morning and rose to 7,200 yuan. After opening, the buying trend increased, and the price gradually rose to around 8,500 before entering a consolidation phase. Other stocks were also driven up. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha and British Alliance rebounded by 20%, and Jardine Matheson, Jardine Brewery, Steel Industry, Asian Industry, and Guangzhou Paper Industry each rose by 10% to 15%.</p>
<h3>China Sugar White Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Lower Than Company's Opening Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to soften due to weak actual sales. The company's current cargo of No. 20 China Sugar White initially opened at 100,000 yuan, then fell to 98,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan, with the lowest at 93,000 yuan, and then slightly recovered by 5,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan, falling by 5-6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Warehouse receipts initially fell by 4,000 yuan to 94,000 yuan, the lowest once breaking the 90,000 mark to 89,000 yuan, and then slightly rose to 90,000 to 90,500 yuan, falling by more than 7,000 yuan. No. 1 cargo only had a small number of transactions, and prices continued to decline. Huabang opened 20-30 packages of red sugar at 100,400 to 2,000 yuan, Shantou gang opened 40-50 packages of Huanggang Qing at 80,000 to 79,000 yuan, and ordinary cotton red more than 30 packages at 100,500.</p>
<h3>Crowded Ship Arrivals and Large Settlements, US Dollars Firm, Hong Kong Notes Rise, Gold Prices Stable and Slightly Lower by 5,000</h3>
<p>Red dates were extremely stable yesterday. There was a slight consolidation during the central government's allocation, but due to the strong US dollar, buying interest remained strong. The morning opening was stable, and after opening, it gradually declined from 1.95 million. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 55 bars at 1.9375 million. After this, there was a small consolidation to 1.93 million. However, the buying trend of US dollars rose again, and at noon it returned to above 1.95 million. The afternoon was peaceful, with little fluctuations. As a result, compared with the previous closing, it fell slightly by 5,000. Gold ornaments were 110,800, silver 1,800, the dark discount on silver was loose, and the interest rate was 1.5 to 1.8 corners.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange, US dollars, initially stable and then attractive. Crowded ship arrivals, huge settlements. At the beginning of the session, it hovered around 2,550 yuan. After 10:00 AM, the situation tightened again. At noon, it rose to around 2,620 yuan and then slightly pulled back. In the afternoon, settlements stopped slightly, and the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, there was not much difference compared with the previous day. Hong Kong notes were attractive, and the result continued to rise by 5 yuan, Hong Kong exchange rate was around 540 yuan, Indian exchange rate was sold at 660 yuan, British exchange rate was 8,600 to 8,800, and there were not many transactions. The US exchange rate remained flat, and counterparty transactions were still sluggish.</p>
<h3>Grain Market Dynamics Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>More Than 200 Rice Shops Can Sell Fair Rice Today</p>
<p>Since the Municipal White Rice Price Review Committee began reviewing the prices of various grains, the trading of north-south rice markets, which had been suspended for a long time, has gradually returned to normal. There were also arrivals from various producing areas yesterday morning, reaching more than 4,000 dan. Rice shops in the urban area have already put marked price grains on the market.</p>
<p>The authorities' regulations on purchasing low-priced rice with household permits were originally scheduled to begin universally yesterday. However, due to the procedures for shipping goods, it was permitted that more than one-tenth of the rice shops in each district of the city could sell today, on the morning, according to the current rice shops of approximately two thousand in the city, more than two hundred shops can be confirmed for the first phase. Flour supply and demand is abundant, and prices are fair. After several days of decline in oil prices, shops are actively restocking, recovering from fatigue, and rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans are stable. Red grains are scarce and unsupported. Sesame market is active, and prices rise by 1-2,000 yuan. Bran is dull, falling by 100 yuan. Soybean cake is continuously used for farmland fertilizer, rising by 2-300 yuan. High-quality wheat selected by the Guangdong gang is moving but not strong, and the middle and lower grades are still sluggish. Factories are not actively stocking due to the sluggish flour market.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Securities Industry to Start Organizing Association</h3>
<p>127 Members Registered</p>
<p>The Wuhan Securities Association attempted to resume its operations after the victory. However, due to the large difference between the market price and the face value of bonds after the war, and the high dark discount in the market, the number of bonds circulating in Wuhan was also less than in Shanghai, resulting in its failure to materialize. Recently, due to the government's announcement of the unified repayment of principal and interest on government bonds, bondholders have been actively seeking to sell their bonds, and the number of circulating chips has increased sharply. People engaged in this industry feel that it is necessary to actively prepare for a formal trading market and are starting to organize an association. A total of 127 members have already registered, and the official establishment date is expected to be around late August.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance May Allow Discretionary Reduction of Bank Reserve Requirements, Authorizing the Central Bank to Decide</h3>
<p>Commercial banks are required to deposit reserve funds with the Central Bank for demand and time deposits. The banking associations in Tianjin, Shanghai, Ping, and Chongqing believe that this measure will significantly affect the flow of funds and have expressed their opinions one after another. It is understood that the government, in consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, may make changes to the amount of reserve funds to be deposited. The original 20% reserve requirement for demand deposits may be reduced to 15%, and the original 15% reserve requirement for time deposits may also be reduced to 7%. The Ministry of Finance has authorized the Central Bank to make discretionary decisions.</p>
<h3>Decline in US Silk Prices Affects Chinese Silk Exports</h3>
<p>Since the news that the price of domestic silk in the US market will drop from US$9 per pound to US$6 per pound was reported, it has caused deep anxiety among silk merchants in various places. According to Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of China Silk Corporation, China's silk production this year is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. Of the 12,000 bales shipped to the US, calculated at US$9 per pound, only a little over US$10 million in foreign exchange can be recovered. And there is currently talk of lowering the value of raw silk in the United States. If this happens, the situation will be even more unthinkable. Currently, the company has 200 bales of raw silk shipped to the US, all calculated at a price of $9 per pound. However, based on the exchange rate, the loss is more than one-third per pound. If the price of raw silk in the United States drops from $9 to $6 per pound, domestic silk merchants will be discouraged from moving forward, and the export of raw silk is worrying. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can adjust tariffs as soon as possible to save the silk industry from its desperate situation.</p>
<h3>Summer Woolen Fabrics Plummet</h3>
<p>Summer woolen fabrics have completely gone out of season by today. Only door shops have a slight sales volume left. Looking at the seasonal goods of this summer, such as Palice, Fanting, Feather Yarn, etc., their crazy price increases were truly beyond expectations. To this day, autumn and winter prices are uniquely affected by this. Now that the season has passed, buyers are indifferent, and although those who are trapped want to sell at a loss, there are no buyers. White straight tributes and white drill crashes are especially severe. Although linen canvas and waxed thread canvas are manufactured by this factory, they are falling sharply. Although it is related to the passing of the sales day, the shift in people's hearts is more drastic than in previous years. Screw four wool and Ban four wool, because they can still be sold for a short period in early autumn, so the decline is relatively mild. French velvet can be sold in both cold and hot seasons, only the colors are changed, so it can maintain the current state. The sales of Barré and Fat Biji are far less than that of Palice and Feather Yarn, so their trend is even weaker than the above-mentioned goods. Xue克斯 topped in summer. The demand and supply of this commodity were both quiet, and it disappeared from the market long ago. American twill fabrics have become a popular commodity, and the drop is very small.</p>
<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>Tea: Regarding the tea market for foreign firms, recently, British firm Jardine Matheson and the Zhiyutai Tea Company have frequently inspected and bid on Keemun aged black tea. However, the price offered for top-grade goods is only slightly over 80,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), making it difficult to break the deadlock. As for stores and firms in this district from Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, given the good sales, there are still inquiries, and the overall market trend is steadily flat.</p>
<p>Hardware: Wood screws continue to rise. Lock factories are offering higher prices than the market, but due to limited sales, they are temporarily selling at the original price. The first batch of imported "Knife Brand" triangular files was sold out due to the small quantity. Current asking prices have increased by 10-20%. GTD screws have arrived, and their prices are higher than OK Yau Kang (another brand). Small-sized decorated tubes remain firm and expensive, while large-sized decorated tubes are slightly trending upward. There has not been much change in steel plates.</p>
<p>Seafood: Affected by tight credit, trading is sluggish. With the arrival of the hot summer, sales have declined. Shrimp tails, sea swallow nests, tapioca starch, and wood ear from Hunan have shifted from stable to weak. Agar-agar, shiitake mushrooms, and sago have all seen declines. Squid, American ginseng, dried opened sea cucumber, and kelp are also struggling to hold their ground. However, the arrival of shiitake mushrooms is scarce, reducing consumption, and showing signs of strength. Prices of other goods are generally flat.</p>
<p>Wood: The lumber market improved slightly yesterday. Buyers made some purchases, sales were active, and prices rose.</p>
<h3>World Gold Reserves: Totaling 34,000 Tons; The United States Holds More Than Two-Thirds</h3>
<p>Gold is now viewed as important. According to estimates from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the world's total gold reserves are approximately $29,080,000,000. Calculated at the legal gold content of the U.S. dollar (15 and 5/21 grains), the world's total gold reserves are approximately 34,202.5 metric tons. Before the Pacific War, the United States held more than 80% of the world's gold. It currently holds 69% (i.e., slightly more than 23,599 tons). In the early stages of the European war, much of Europe's gold flowed into the United States. After the Pacific War, the United States paid in gold for wartime raw materials purchased from countries in Central and South America, resulting in a slight decrease in U.S. gold reserves and a sharp increase in reserves in South and Central American nations. The following is a list of gold holdings by country as of the end of January this year: (Units: Millions of USD)</p>
<p>United States 20,156 South Africa 949</p>
<p>France 1,576 India 274</p>
<p>Switzerland 1,099 Turkey 241</p>
<p>United Kingdom 1 Mexico 288</p>

<h3>My Air Force's Eighth Group: Journey to Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>Our Aircraft Proceeds at an Airspeed of 160 Knots</p>
<p>As soon as our plane took off, it entered the clouds. We felt raindrops falling like pinpricks. In the cabin, two of our comrades, with the assistance of Chief Mechanic Xu Shulin, prepared various items and flew towards 78 degrees. At the same time, they increased the altitude of the plane. I looked at the scene outside the window through the glass, and it was all white clouds. However, the plane's engines were right before my eyes. Relying on the horsepower of these one or two engines, we proceeded at an airspeed of 160 knots.</p>
<p>The B-24 aircraft was the most frequently used aircraft by the United States during this war, especially in the European theater. Based in England, it was mainly used to bomb German front lines and rear areas. The silver-white, four-engine plane with tail rudder was widely used. Not only the U.S. Air Force used it, but the U.S., Canada, and the Soviet Union all borrowed it through the Lend-Lease Act. The first B-24 aircraft to enter China arrived from the Soviet Union when Wendell Willkie visited China. Soon after, Chennault's 14th Air Force used it from Kunming to bomb Japanese bases in Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places. Later, the B-24 also participated in bombing Hong Kong and Wuhan. The majestic silhouette of the "Liberator" aircraft spread throughout the country and abroad. However, the nine-hour flight range of this aircraft was not sufficient to bomb the Japanese mainland in the Pacific, so the Americans specially built the B-29, a super fortress with a sixteen-hour flight range, to carry out long-range bombing. From then on, the Japanese mainland was plunged into disintegration. After island-hopping and capturing the Ogasawara Islands, Iwo Jima, and the Ryukyu Islands, the power of the B-24 aircraft could also reach the Japanese mainland. As a result, the silver-white "lady" also frequently visited the beautiful Japanese islands. The Air Force's Eighth Group, having hastily completed training in the United States, rushed back to the Far East. While waiting for orders in India, it was supposed to be stationed on the Ryukyu Islands to participate in the final attacks by the U.S. military on Japan. However, before this grand ambition could be realized, Japan surrendered! This naturally disappointed the group. Though life has entered an era of peace, troops bearing heavy responsibility for national defense must still maintain vigilance on the front line and be concerned about all the realities within their realm. The Eighth Group is therefore ordered to regularly conduct familiarization flights centered on Shanghai to maintain a high level of flight proficiency.</p>
<p>As Group Commander Wang Shijun lit a cigarette in the cockpit, we smelled the aroma of the smoke. Even though the plane was flying blindly in the clouds (the boundaries between heaven and earth cannot be seen; navigation is guided by instruments, hence the term "blind flying," although today the Americans call it "instrument flying"), the first stage of tension and haste had passed. Our plane had entered a state of stable and continuous flight. When Captain Wang Guonan also lit a cigarette, the habit of smoking spread to our radio cabin. Chen Gong, wearing a headset and watching the transmitter and notebook, also smoked. Xu Shulin, running back and forth, up and down, to manipulate various mechanical switches, also smoked. The few of us also smoked and ate candy. Regiment Commander Zhu Shiming ate nothing, only swallowing a small white pill from a small copper box.</p>
<p>In the relaxed atmosphere of smoking, Xu Shulin first told me: In order for a large, thirty-ton aircraft to fly steadily in clouds where neither heaven nor earth can be seen, in addition to the compass and the level, there is also a row of six amber-colored indicator lights that constantly flash to alert the pilot. These six small, loquat-sized lights have the following functions: The four lights on the left side are parallel. The first light indicates left roll, the second indicates right roll, the third indicates yaw to the left, and the fourth indicates yaw to the right. Of the two small lights on the right side, if the top light flashes, it indicates that the nose is pointing upward; if the bottom light flashes, it indicates that the tail is pointing upward. Relying on the flashing of these six small yellow lights, the pilot makes gentle, slow, and small adjustments to the aircraft to keep it moving in a level flight path over long distances.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, the celestial sphere could be seen. Wang Shijun looked up at the clouds above and said:</p>
<p>"There are three layers of clouds over the sea today."</p>
<p>Wang Guonan nodded and said:</p>
<p>"Jiangwan isn't calling for takeoff."</p>
<p>Pilots love to adhere to scheduled times. Wang Shijun himself set the takeoff time for the 20th. When the time came, he obeyed the order himself, not postponing due to the adverse weather conditions at sea. However, the American base provided a good forecast: Although it was raining and cloudy in the target location, Tokyo, in the morning, just like Shanghai, the weather would clear up when the plane arrived in the afternoon. The clouds would dissipate, the rain would stop, and the ground would be clear, so that the plane would not encounter cloud-covered Mount Fuji and crash into its snowy peak. Based on this forecast, Captain Wang Guonan filled out the flight plan, and the Americans immediately telegraphed the U.S. military station in Japan to announce that a Chinese B-24 aircraft had taken off, climbed to 18,000 feet, and was flying towards Japan, and instructed the aircraft to contact the U.S. military station in Japan when it was close to the Japanese mainland.</p>
<h3>A Navigator Who Won't Get Lost</h3>
<p>At eleven o'clock, they changed course to 83 degrees, the direction calculated by navigator Huang Eryi. Huang Eryi had already entered the navigator's compartment in front of and below the cockpit. He was alone, working on the ground speed, time, and compass. Finally, he told the pilot to change course to 83 degrees at 11:00 (slightly south of the original heading). Huang Eryi is from Shanghai. In two years in the United States, he learned the ability to navigate B-24s to any region, like a pilot or navigator on a sea vessel who won't get lost.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, we saw the sea. Below the plane at 9,000 feet were white clouds, thin wisps covering the pale blue sea. This scene made first-time viewers think that the inverted sky was below the plane, but the plane was flying forward, not backward. The pale blue color was of course the sea. (From this, I got the impression that the sea reflects the light of the clouds as pale blue rather than turquoise.) Li Maoh suddenly took off his headphones and said with a worried expression: "It's raining in Tokyo."</p>
<p>I knew this news was quite serious, hence his worried expression. But he quickly added: "It will clear up at 3 p.m. That's when we'll arrive in Tokyo." This naturally put us at ease.</p>
<p>The plane entered another cloud formation, colliding with or avoiding clouds, and the fuselage was rocking up, down, left, and right. I was worried that the four female typists from the Chinese delegation would vomit, but fortunately, they were all normal. I asked them about their number of flights. Two of them were first-timers, one was a second-timer, and one, Miss Bai Yang, who looked like a Japanese girl, had flown sixteen times. She had been to Kunming and Chongqing. She had previously worked as a typist for the U.S. military, and she called herself an "old flyer," which made us laugh.</p>
<p>At twelve thirty-five, Xu Shulin told me: The Japanese mainland is below. He pointed down, pointed to the window. Green forests and yellow land were interspersed. The yellow roads looked like irregular belts of clothing left on the ground. Kyushu, judging from its appearance, is an agricultural, forestry, and fishing area. This can be inferred simply from the fact that the roads are not wide and there are not many railways. But in reality, it has the famous mining areas of Xiaobayashi and Baba and railway lines also extend to any location. A brief glance at the exterior cannot reveal the contents clearly, just as looking at a person's appearance cannot reveal their inner thoughts. After passing over the northern tip of Kyushu, the plane flew over the straits of Japan between Shikoku and Honshu. At one ten, Regiment Commander Zhu Huiming came down from the cockpit and said: "The plane is flying towards Osaka!" Xu Shulin predicted: "We'll be in Osaka at 2:05!" (To be continued)</p>

<p>Loyal Employees Request Reinstatement</p>
<p>The Suzhou Electric Company was established with funds from Changzhou natives and was founded more than ten years before the War of Resistance. It was originally managed by Manager Ding Chunzhi, who put in a great deal of effort and painstaking management, allowing the business to flourish. We have served at the company since before the war and for many years. We believe that we have been able to fulfill our duties and made contributions to laying the foundation for the business. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Japanese invaders have wreaked havoc with their military force and frenzied aggression. At that time, we either withdrew westward with the army or fulfilled our duties until the last minute before taking refuge in the countryside to escape the disaster and survive. After the Japanese invaders occupied Suzhou, the company was seized by the Japanese invaders, forcibly reorganized, and Japanese were appointed as advisors and important officials in various departments. Manager Ding's authority was stripped, and he died indignantly in protest. At that time, we could have requested reinstatement, but out of a sense of righteousness, we never dared to be coerced by the enemy and puppets, preferring to live in exile or in poverty in Songjia Garden, pawning our belongings to survive. In August of the thirty-fourth year, the War of Resistance was won, and the Japanese invaders surrendered. The Suzhou Electric Company was taken over by Zhang Zhitong, an engineer from the company before the war, who was appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to be responsible for the takeover and to oversee everything. Seeing the dawn of a new day, we jointly signed a request to Zhang to grant us reinstatement (those who had fled to the provinces of Sichuan and Hunan had returned to Suzhou one after another and also intended to participate in the reinstatement) and requested that all those who were employed during the enemy-puppet period after November of the twenty-sixth year, who accounted for about two-thirds of the current staff, be dismissed in order to clarify right and wrong and encourage loyalty. However, Zhang believed that the company would soon be returned to private ownership and it was not convenient to readily agree to our request, so he delayed for several months without a concrete reply. Under the increasingly high pressure of daily life, we increasingly felt that our livelihoods could not be sustained. In May of this year, the company was returned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a reorganization committee was formed to reorganize the company. Upon hearing the news, we again requested reinstatement from the reorganization committee. Another month has passed, and there are still no results. It is reported that the committee discussed this issue in its meetings, expressing sympathy, but regrettably delayed implementation, which is deeply regrettable. Now, we are making a final appeal and earnestly request that the relevant authorities understand the suffering of the unemployed employees and quickly reinstate all the employees. We hope that you will do so. (Sincerely, more than twenty former employees of the Suzhou Electric Company who left their jobs before the war)</p>

<h3>Summer Diarrhea</h3>
<p>— Lin Zhaoqi</p>
<p>Clarification</p>
<p>While the term "summer diarrhea" is common, its meaning is quite vague. Firstly, it does not specifically refer to one particular disease, but rather broadly encompasses various diarrheal conditions caused by different pathogens (i.e., germs). Secondly, diarrhea is not limited to the summer season; it also occurs in the autumn, and a small number of cases occur year-round.</p>
<p>Besides "summer diarrhea," another term commonly used to refer to acute bacterial diarrhea is "food poisoning." However, the term "food poisoning" is too broad and easily leads to misunderstanding. The term suggests that the food itself is poisonous, which is certainly true in cases of pufferfish poisoning or mushroom poisoning. However, in acute bacterial diarrhea, the food itself does not contain toxins; it is simply contaminated with bacteria that cause diarrhea when consumed. Using the term "food poisoning" for diarrhea leads to the misconception that the cause lies in the food itself, rather than in the bacteria.</p>
<p>From the above, it is clear that neither "summer diarrhea" nor "food poisoning" is an appropriate term. If we were to find a more suitable term, we might call it "acute bacterial diarrhea." However, this is still a general term. If we focus on the part of the body affected by the disease, we could use terms like "acute bacterial colitis" or "acute bacterial enterocolitis." If we want to specify that a certain type of diarrhea is caused by a specific bacterium, then the name of that bacterium should be used.</p>
<p>Pathogens</p>
<p>All cases of acute bacterial diarrhea are caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria or bacterial toxins. The types of bacteria that cause diarrhea include: (1) Salmonella species, especially *Salmonella choleraesuis*, *Salmonella enteritidis*, *Salmonella paratyphi A*, *Salmonella paratyphi B*; (2) Shigella species; (3) Staphylococcus aureus toxins; (4) In addition, some microorganisms are harmless themselves, such as *Escherichia coli*, *Proteus vulgaris*, *Bacillus recti*, *Streptococcus lactis*, *Streptococcus viridans*, etc. However, under favorable conditions (for bacteria), they can multiply in certain foods and produce toxins, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort after consumption. Among these four types of bacteria, Salmonella species are the largest source of acute bacterial diarrhea. Salmonella bacteria are most easily found in pork, milk, fish, and eggs, and are less likely to grow in vegetables, grains, and fresh fruits. Unhygienic meat comes from two sources: one is diseased pigs and cattle—pigs and cattle, like humans, can be infected with Salmonella species and suffer from gastrointestinal and other diseases. People who eat meat from diseased pigs and cattle can become infected and develop diarrhea. The other source is healthy livestock, but the livestock becomes contaminated with bacteria during slaughtering, cooking, or curing, which is enough to cause diarrhea. If a cow's udder is infected with bacteria, the milk produced will inevitably be contaminated. In addition, it is common for cow dung to contain bacteria and contaminate the milk. In recent years, there has been considerable research into the transmission of disease through eggs. Research suggests that undercooked duck eggs are more likely to transmit disease than chicken or pigeon eggs. This is because ducks are very susceptible to enteritis, and duck eggs can become infected with bacteria within the mother's body.</p>
<p>Acute bacterial diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus toxins typically has a very short incubation period. Patients experience vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and sometimes even fainting. Canned fish and meat, preserved fish and meat, and milk are all likely to be contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus. However, according to research statistics, cases of diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus toxins are not very common and do not pose a serious threat.</p>
<p>Epidemiology</p>
<p>Acute bacterial diarrhea is most prevalent in the summer and autumn, likely due to the hot weather, which favors bacterial growth, and the increased activity of flies, which spread the disease. In addition to seasonal factors, other factors that contribute to the spread of diarrhea should also be considered, such as overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, contaminated drinking water, and spoiled food.</p>
<p>The infectiousness of acute bacterial diarrhea is very high. Almost everyone who eats food containing the bacteria will develop diarrhea. Those who are spared may have consumed a small amount, have sufficient stomach acid to kill the bacteria, or have strong resistance. According to Geiger's statistics, 75% to 100% of people who eat contaminated food develop diarrhea.</p>
<p>However, the mortality rate of acute bacterial diarrhea is very low. According to Geiger's statistics, the mortality rate in the United States is only 0.5%, and according to Shah's statistics, the mortality rate in the United Kingdom is only 1.5%. There is little difference in the morbidity and mortality rates between male and female patients. In terms of age, the mortality rate is higher in young children and the elderly. Opium addiction, coexisting chronic illnesses that weaken the body, starvation, and malnutrition can all worsen acute bacterial diarrhea.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>The incubation period for Salmonella species and Shigella species diarrhea ranges from half an hour to 24 hours. Diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus toxins has a shorter incubation period, generally between half an hour and four hours. The more toxins present in the food, the faster the symptoms appear. In addition, the length of the incubation period depends on other factors. For example, if the contaminated food is eaten on an empty stomach, the symptoms will appear quickly. Also, if everything eaten is contaminated or contains bacterial toxins, the symptoms will appear earlier than if the food is eaten along with other foods. Because food enters the stomach first, acute gastritis symptoms occur earlier than acute enteritis and colitis symptoms. Patients initially feel bloating in the upper abdomen, followed by pain, and then vomiting. Initially, the vomit consists of food and mucus, but no gastric juices, or very little. Then, the vomiting consists of mucus, saliva, and bile, sometimes with a small amount of blood. This is followed by abdominal cramps and pain, dizziness, collapse, and other symptoms. Severe vomiting often leads to dehydration, profuse sweating, muscle cramps, restlessness, cold and clammy skin, facial wasting, hoarseness, rapid breathing, a temperature below normal, low blood pressure, depleted peripheral veins, and a weak pulse. The appearance of the stool depends on the part of the intestine affected. In enteritis, the stool is voluminous, watery, and foul-smelling. In colitis, the stool contains mucus, blood, or pus, but is not watery. Patients sometimes experience anal pain and swelling, due to irritation of the rectum or because the colitis has spread to the rectum. Mild cases of acute symptoms resolve spontaneously within 12 to 24 hours. For the next few days, there is a loss of appetite, weakness, and mild abdominal discomfort. Large amounts of food cannot be consumed. After this, recovery is complete. Even in severe cases, if treated properly, recovery can be uneventful, though it may take longer. However, if diarrhea is complicated by other conditions, there is a risk of the condition worsening. Patients may die from severe poisoning, extreme dehydration, or sudden energy depletion (due to acidosis and uremia). Sometimes, after the initial symptoms—vomiting and diarrhea—appear, symptoms similar to typhoid fever follow, because other internal organs and tissues have been invaded by bacteria. In this case, the illness will be prolonged and there is often a risk of complications, such as bronchopneumonia, vitamin deficiency, bedsores, and metastatic pyemia. Sometimes, after a person has acute bacterial diarrhea, the bacteria in the intestine are not completely eliminated despite treatment, leading to chronic recurrent enterocolitis, which can persist for years, similar to chronic or recurrent dysentery.</p>
<p>Detection of Transmission</p>
<p>Acute bacterial diarrhea is usually not difficult to diagnose, especially when multiple members of the same household are affected. Sometimes, several people in a family develop diarrhea at the same time, because they ate contaminated food at the same time. Sometimes, family members develop diarrhea at different times, because they ate at different times, or because of person-to-person transmission.</p>
<p>Whether acute bacterial diarrhea occurs on a small scale within a family or on a large scale in a group of people or a location, the following procedures should be used to investigate: (1) Compile a complete case history; (2) Collect medical histories; (3) Identify the route of transmission; (4) Investigate the source of the causative food; (5) Collect various pieces of evidence to determine how the food became contaminated with bacteria or toxins. In addition, collect and examine various items related to the occurrence and transmission of diarrhea: (1) Leftover food; (2) The patient's vomit and stool (examining vomit is often less reliable than examining stool); (3) If there are signs that the bacteria have invaded other parts of the body, bone marrow cultures, blood cultures, stool cultures, saliva cultures, and agglutination tests should be performed; (4) If the patient dies, bacterial cultures should be performed on the contents of the intestine, the intestinal mucosa, the intestinal mucosal lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart blood, spleen, and liver. (5) If the examination does not find Salmonella or Shigella, then the food consumed should be examined for the presence of bacterial toxins.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>In addition to emphasizing environmental hygiene, personal hygiene, and clean drinking water, the prevention of acute bacterial diarrhea requires various preventive measures to protect meat (because acute bacterial diarrhea is mostly transmitted through meat, meat is given special attention) from bacterial contamination from slaughtering to cooking and consumption. Health authorities should strictly inspect meat, and diseased animals should be absolutely prohibited from sale and consumption. Restaurants and families should not hire cooks who have had intestinal illnesses. Food should be fresh and thoroughly cooked before consumption. Canned foods often still contain living bacteria even after being boiled for more than an hour; these are mostly thermophilic bacteria or spore-forming bacteria. According to the results of numerous tests and studies, canned food contains bacteria in about 7% of cases. However, freshly prepared foods contain even more bacteria than canned foods, so they must be cooked thoroughly before eating—even if cooking does not kill all the bacteria, it will at least reduce their numbers significantly. If food is not eaten immediately after cooking, it should be stored in a cool place, preferably in the refrigerator. Otherwise, the remaining bacteria will multiply and cause problems.</p>
<p>During this cholera epidemic, some people may mistake severe acute bacterial diarrhea for cholera. In fact, their transmission routes are quite similar, and their prevention methods are also similar - all drinks and food must be cooked and disinfected!!!</p>
<p>Bacterial Stories</p>
<h3>An Autobiography of a Malarial Protozoan</h3>
<p>— Tao Shouqi</p>
<p>It has been more than sixty years since I was first discovered by humans in 1880. However, apart from the medical community, many people still lack adequate understanding of me. Allow me to take this opportunity to introduce myself.</p>
<p>I am one of the most basic members of the animal kingdom. My entire body is made up of a single cell, so zoologists call me a "malarial protozoan." When I am young, my body is only about one-tenth to one-twelfth the size of a human red blood cell. When I am at my largest, I am only slightly larger than a normal red blood cell.</p>
<p>Although my body is so simple and small, my life experience is quite complex. My entire life cycle can be divided into the following two phases:</p>
<p>(1) The first is the asexual reproduction cycle—which occurs within human blood. I enter the human body when a certain type of mosquito bites a person, carrying me from its mouth into the person's skin and into the bloodstream. In the blood, I reside in red blood cells and rely on the nutrients in the red blood cells to grow and reproduce. Every one, two, or three days, I divide from one into more than ten. After a period of time, I also produce reproductive protozoa, which are differentiated into male and female. These reproductive protozoa must be passed on through inoculation, which requires the mosquito to bite a person again, allowing them to enter the mosquito's stomach from its mouth.</p>
<p>(2) From here, we begin the sexual reproduction cycle. In the mosquito's stomach, the male and female protozoa combine and burrow into the stomach wall, gradually growing into an oocyst. When mature, the oocyst ruptures, releasing many reproductive sporozoites, which spread throughout the mosquito's body, especially in its salivary glands. This entire sexual reproduction cycle takes an average of ten to twelve days to complete. If the mosquito bites a person again at this time, it can carry my reproductive sporozoites along with its saliva into the person's blood, initiating a new asexual reproduction cycle.</p>
<p>To fully convey the hardships of my life, I must add a few more points about my living conditions:</p>
<p>(1) My parasitic life is an absolute necessity (known as obligate parasitism in parasitology), meaning that I absolutely cannot survive outside of the human body or the mosquito.</p>
<p>(2) Among mosquitoes, not every type of mosquito can host me. Only a few species within the Anopheles genus are suitable. Moreover, these mosquitoes are often disliked by humans. If the mosquitoes are harmed, I will also not be able to survive.</p>
<p>(3) In the human body, I parasitize red blood cells, which are a very important part of life. Therefore, my growth inside inevitably harms human health, causing various terrible malarial symptoms, and sometimes even death. If my host dies, I can only perish along with them. This situation is the most unfortunate for us who live a parasitic life.</p>
<p>Living such a mysterious and depressing life, I truly harm both myself and others. Fortunately, until now, many people still do not understand the truth about malaria. They do not know that I am the one causing trouble, and still believe that malaria is caused by inhaling some miasma in the air or drinking some dirty water on the ground. Otherwise, in this era of advancing human science, with increasingly effective methods of mosquito control, my survival and growth would be greatly threatened.</p>
<h3>Heatstroke</h3>
<p>— Zheng Weiru</p>
<p>Yang Yannian had just finished his junior high school final exams on the afternoon of June 29th. Days of preparing for lessons and submitting exam papers had caused him to eat much less at each meal. Furthermore, he had a strong competitive spirit, so he would cram into the night before each exam. Now that the final exams were successfully completed, he felt as if a great burden had been lifted, and he was elated. The fatigue caused by preparing for the exams before was now completely gone. Therefore, he arranged to go on a picnic with his brother to the outskirts of Jiangwan on Sunday, the 30th. His brother saw that Yannian was happy and in high spirits, and to reward him for his hard work on the exams, he couldn't bear to refuse his younger brother's request. Besides, the 30th was Sunday, a perfect opportunity to accompany him and have a good time. So he readily agreed. He would take care of all the preparations for the picnic himself, which made Yannian even happier. Since the War of Resistance, the enemy's blockades and alerts had confined Yannian's active mind as if in a cage. Now that the War of Resistance had been won, he would be able to freely roam the Jiangwan city center, which he had dreamed of day and night, tomorrow.</p>
<p>The next morning at ten o'clock, the two of them took streetcar, carrying dry food and fruit. The car was very crowded and bumpy, and Yannian felt a little unwell, but because he was in high spirits, he perked himself up. After getting off the car, he walked for more than ten minutes in the sun and was already a bit tired. His legs felt heavy, his chest was heavy and stuffy, and even breathing felt weak. At this point, he staggered, felt dizzy, and everything went dark before his eyes. He suddenly fell into his brother's arms. Fortunately, his brother had noticed that Yannian's face was pale, his lips had no color, sweat was dripping from his forehead, he had a pained expression, and he was walking with difficulty, so he knew something was wrong. When he saw his brother about to fall, he grabbed him with one hand and felt that Yannian's arm was very cold. He repeatedly called out, "Yannian, Yannian, what's wrong?" His younger brother replied weakly, "I feel awful, I feel awful." At this point, Yannian had been moved to the shade of a tree by the roadside and was lying propped up against the trunk. His brother opened his collar, wiped away the sweat, and applied the peppermint lozenge he had brought around his lips. He saw that Yannian was much more awake at this point, so he cut an orange for him to eat. Yannian gradually recovered and was able to sit up with effort. His brother was greatly relieved and hired a car to take him home to rest.</p>
<p>The above passage describes a common heatstroke and exhaustion scenario seen in the summer. In high temperatures and high relative humidity, coupled with physiological abnormalities, excessive nervous tension, clothing that is too thick or tight, poor ventilation, and crowded conditions, the heart function is most likely to become unbalanced, leading to fainting. Therefore, in first aid, the patient should be moved to a cool and ventilated place as soon as possible. Loosen or remove clothing. Splash cold water on the face or chest to help the patient wake up, or use aromatic spirits or alcohol as stimulants to get the patient out of danger. Heat exhaustion is the mildest form of heatstroke, but if not treated properly, it can also lead to death!</p>
<p>There is also hyperthermic heatstroke, which is endemic in tropical regions. This disease often occurs in new immigrants to the tropics. It seems less common among locals, probably because people accustomed to hot climates have bodies that have become adept at coping with high temperatures. In the Shanghai area, this condition can also be seen in the summer. The cause is also being in an environment of high temperature and high relative humidity, drinking too little water, wearing inappropriate clothing, and cessation of sweating, so that body heat cannot be released temporarily. Sometimes the cessation of sweating lasts from one hour to forty-eight hours, and the heat produced by the body has no way to dissipate and accumulates in the body, leading to a continuous rise in body temperature. The patient may have vomiting and diarrhea, resembling cholera, or be mentally restless, agitated, and delirious, with hot and dry skin. When the rectal temperature reaches 42.2 degrees Celsius, consciousness is immediately lost. If such a high fever is allowed to persist for two hours, there is often no hope of recovery. Therefore, treatment should be as fast as possible, otherwise a delay of a few hours will result in the patient being beyond help. The main goal is to reduce the body temperature to a safe degree. The method is to pour cold water all over the body and then fan the air around the body, or wrap the patient's body in a wet towel and then fan the air. This method uses artificial means to give the body the effect of sweating, in order to reduce body temperature. Another method is to place the patient in water at 11 degrees Celsius while vigorously rubbing the entire body to accelerate blood circulation and allow the high body temperature to be dissipated. At the same time, pay attention to the rectal temperature. If it reaches 38.8 degrees Celsius, the patient should be removed from the cold water to prevent a sharp drop in body temperature, which can lead to collapse. Experiments have shown that the heat required for one gram of water to evaporate from the skin is about half a calorie. If one gram of ice is placed on the skin to melt, the heat absorbed from the skin is less than one-tenth of a calorie. Therefore, using ice to reduce body temperature is not as effective as using water. Moreover, when the skin encounters excessively cold ice, the capillaries will often contract, which is another obstacle to reducing body temperature. In the past, some people used ice water enemas to reduce high body temperature, but experiments have shown that using one kilogram of ice water enema reduces the heat equivalent to the heat from evaporating 70 grams of water from the skin. Other treatments, such as intravenous injection of physiological saline to promote the excretion of toxins, and the use of cardiac and respiratory stimulants, should be determined according to the patient's condition.</p>
<p>There is also so-called sunstroke, which is caused by direct sunlight on the human body. The symptoms are similar to meningitis. The patient has extreme headaches, hot and dry skin, photophobia, vomiting, and even high fever and delirium. The treatment is generally the same as for hyperthermic heatstroke.</p>
<p>There is also a type of heatstroke in which the symptoms are mainly abdominal or general pain with spasms, and the body temperature is not too high. This is because the patient works in high temperatures, sweats a lot, and feels thirsty, so they drink a lot of water to quench their thirst. However, the high-temperature environment remains unchanged. They continue to sweat, continue to feel thirsty, and this cycle continues. Because the water they drink does not contain salt, but the sweat they produce contains from 6/10,000 to 6/1,000 of salt. The salt in the body continues to be excreted in sweat without being replenished, leading to painful spasms. Therefore, in terms of treatment, in addition to moving the patient out of the high-heat environment, intravenous injection of physiological saline is the only treatment. Workers working in high temperatures should often use 1/1,000 salt water as a drink. During the recent war, British cruisers used 1% cold salt water as a drink.</p>
<p>Humanity is uniquely blessed, and is able to adapt to all kinds of harsh environments. People live even in the icy Arctic. In tropical regions, where the climate is above 40 degrees Celsius, humans can also be found. In order to survive, they must engage in various activities. For example, coal stokers on tropical ships sometimes have to work at 65 degrees Celsius, and they do not experience heatstroke. It can be seen that as long as one is healthy and the physiological regulation function is normal, and does not allow physical strength to be overexerted, in addition to nutrition, one should supplement an appropriate amount of water and salt. Even if the working environment is high temperature and high relative humidity, as long as it is ventilated and breathable, and the clothing worn does not hinder sweating and heat dissipation, then the heat generated by our work, 25% of which must be dissipated through skin evaporation and breathing, and 75% dissipated through skin radiation and convection, will not accumulate in the body. Then, although it cannot be said that there will be no risk of heatstroke, it can greatly reduce it.</p>
<p>When Chinese people fall ill in the summer, whether it is typhoid fever, cholera, vomiting and diarrhea caused by improper diet, or heatstroke-related illnesses, they often underestimate it as "feeling unwell." If not given appropriate treatment, it will delay the patient and lead to death.</p>

<h3>Save the Teachers</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>I want to appeal for many primary and secondary school teachers! Although the "Respect Teachers" movement has passed, I hope everyone, when they see their children, will think of their teachers, respect them, love them, and consider the teachers' lives. It is no less than thinking about the future of your own children.</p>
<p>Not just one, not just ten, many, many primary and secondary school teachers I know have reached the point where they have no clothes to wear and nothing to sell. Among them, many are using loans to set up newspaper stands or run mobile glass cabinets. In this day after the victory of the War of Resistance, this kind of scene is happening, and it is happening to this group of intellectuals, role models for people. Do we not feel ashamed?</p>
<p>When people are poor, their ambitions fade. If teachers are worrying about firewood and rice every day, how can they have the heart to teach your children? Moreover, in order to maintain the dignity of teachers, you cannot allow your children to despise, disregard, or demean their teachers. A teacher dressed in rags, standing on the podium, your young ladies and young masters will often whisper, saying: "A beggar! A lousy Russian!"</p>
<p>No need to elaborate further, saying what for the sake of cultivating talent for the country, even for your own glory, even for your children to be able to stand on their own in society in the future, you must think about this large group of people who work diligently and eat chalk dust.</p>

<h3>Talking About "Color"</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>In 1931, the famous Belgian student scientists, Auguste and Jean Piccard, made their first stratospheric exploration flight. The ship was painted white, which resulted in a lot of ice and frost, and they almost froze to death. In 1932, they made their second flight into the stratosphere, painting the ship black, and they almost burned to death. Later, two U.S. Marine Corps officers explored the stratosphere, painting half of the ship light and the other half dark. Their flight was extremely pleasant and comfortable -- the air they breathed was cool and refreshing, and their legs felt warm.</p>
<p>Today, psychologists and scientists have shown us that in many ways, color is of great help to the comfort of daily life.</p>
<p>Antarctic explorers paint their water bottle bags black to prevent freezing. During the day, these water bags absorb plenty of sunlight, keeping the water in the bottles at 60 degrees, even though the outside temperature is minus 35 degrees.</p>
<p>Soviet ships have always been painted red, but two years ago, they were repainted black to conserve heat. The crew members not only felt much more comfortable, but their work efficiency also increased greatly.</p>
<p>The power of black to absorb sunlight is amazing. Frozen harbors can be cleared of snow, painted black, and thawed several weeks earlier. The ice and snow on a black road melt faster than on a white road.</p>
<p>Black horses suffer more from the heat of the sun than horses of other colors, so black horses have shorter lifespans than white horses.</p>
<p>In terms of health, the power of color is remarkable. Color engineers prevent "flight sickness" by adjusting the colors inside aircraft. They have found that brown and yellow are likely to cause vomiting, while green and blue can prevent vomiting. One airline, following the advice of experts, stopped serving egg yolk mayonnaise and replaced the white sheets, pillowcases, and blankets on the sleeper planes with green ones, with excellent results.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a hotel in Chicago tested the effectiveness of color. They invited some guests to dinner. The table was set with fresh steaks and vegetables, tempting hors d'oeuvres and desserts. Everyone had a good appetite, talking and laughing. Suddenly, the lights changed color, with a special light bulb emitting all the colors in the spectrum except red and green. As a result, the steak turned gray-white and the milk turned blood-red.</p>
<p>Within minutes, several guests felt like vomiting, and several others felt very uncomfortable. The banquet was immediately stopped because everyone had lost their appetite.</p>
<p>At a department store in Toledo, the employees' clothing was limited to black and navy blue, and everyone frowned. Later, the personnel department hired a new director who canceled this rule and encouraged female employees to wear clothes with more beautiful colors. As a result, the employees were much more lively and enthusiastic, the atmosphere in the company became more pleasant, and business improved a lot.</p>
<p>Color can also ward off mosquitoes. One expert says that if you hate mosquitoes, put a blue light on in the place where you don't want them, and the mosquitoes will all fly there. Put a red light on in the place where you are sitting, and the mosquitoes won't come. Insects often mistake blue light for the sky. Insects also know that red is a sign of danger and avoid it.</p>
<p>According to correct statistics, nightclub guests stay longer when playing under amber light than under other colored lights.</p>
<p>How many colors are there in the universe? No one knows. Theoretically, there could be ten million colors. Most people say there are thousands.</p>
<p>Color and music are quite similar. One excites the visual sense, the other excites the auditory sense, and both are a kind of vibration. And color is even more powerful, because most of our senses come from sight.</p>
<h3>Buying Rice Log</h3>
<p>— Guochang</p>
<p>The rice in the rice jar was gone, and I couldn't bear to starve on an empty stomach, so I thought of going to Qiu's rice store to buy some rice.</p>
<p>From east to west, from south to north, I ran all over dozens of rice shops, all of which were empty. Helpless, I couldn't buy price-controlled rice, so I had to ask Mr. Zhang next door to lend me a dou of white rice temporarily, and I was ready to return it immediately when the rice store sold price-controlled rice.</p>
<p>Waiting! Waiting! The hungry people were dizzy and confused, unable to tell the difference between humans and ghosts. Finally, a bit of news came out, saying that price-controlled rice would be sold throughout the city. This should be such welcome news!</p>
<p>The next morning, I made a point of getting up early and hurried to a nearby rice store with my rice bag. The doorway was already crowded with hundreds of people. Shouts, cries, and curses were mixed together, creating a chaotic scene, but not a single policeman came to maintain order. Those who had bought rice couldn't squeeze out, and those who hadn't bought rice were still desperately trying to squeeze in. Among them, there were several friends wearing crooked hats and short shirts and pants who used their tall stature to force their way into the crowd. In just a few minutes, they rushed out again with rice on their backs. As a result of this shuttle-like rushing in and out, several piculs of rice ended up in the hands of these few people. Because I was weak and powerless, I could only sigh and return home staggering. But I had to return Zhang's rice. It would be embarrassing to delay it any longer. So, having already gone halfway, I turned back and was forced to make a black market transaction with the crooked hat friends, paying an extra thousand yuan per dou.</p>
<p>After returning Zhang's white rice, I had no rice for myself. Alas! Where is the people's price-controlled rice?</p>
<h3>Lingering Midstream</h3>
<h3>Today's Shanghai Hospitals</h3>
<p>— Fumin</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the reporter for thinking about the happiness of the public and taking the time to investigate the hospital business. I dare to share my humble opinion with everyone about hospitals.</p>
<p>What is a hospital business? Dr. Li Jian'an, a public health expert, said it most thoroughly: "Medicine is not a charitable undertaking, but a great construction undertaking." In the past, the general public thought that providing diagnosis and medication was the full extent of charitable responsibility, not knowing that the human body is the most sensitive and complex machine. To achieve the goal of health, it must be inspected and repaired at all times. Using only the previous diagnostic methods and drugs is clearly like comparing human-powered rickshaws with cars and airplanes. We all know that all means of transportation are the lifeblood of construction, and human health and maintenance are the foundation of construction. Therefore, the medical business is the construction of all construction. In other words, only with perfect medicine can perfect construction be achieved. This is the mission of medicine. As for running a general business, you can make a fortune, but not with medicine. Because once a patient recovers their health, they can use their talent and make many kinds of contributions to society and the country, while the hospital receives only some reasonable fees, and mostly service and sacrifice. Why is that? For example, if a hospital wants to buy a new X-ray machine for US$10,000, it will be delivered in one year. We all know that US$10,000 is currently equivalent to 26 million national currency. Calculating with the black market interest rate, it doubles every four months, so after one year it is 200 million yuan. Even when it arrives in Shanghai and is put into use, the income will definitely not exceed the interest. In other words, the people who benefit are the general public. After an examination, they can obtain health insurance. Early diagnosis and treatment opportunities save medical expenses. Early recovery of health then allows them to engage in production, day by day newer and newer, while the hospital's equipment becomes older year by year. This is just one example. The service and sacrifice of hospitals is generally visible, so aren't such equipment and work "humanity's compassionate boat"? According to my investigation, I know that a certain private sanatorium has long-term free patients who have lived there for several years. They do not pay any fees at all, from admission to discharge. In the past two or three years, there have been more than a hundred such cases, more than any other hospital. Also, during the "August 13th" Shanghai War, all surgical machines, X-rays, etc. were given to the wounded soldiers' hospital for rescue purposes. Also, during the period of Shanghai's fall, medicine was lacking, so a large-scale free X-ray examination for tuberculosis prevention was jointly organized by hospitals throughout the city, so as to penetrate deep into the people for popular treatment. Isn't this "saving all living beings"? At present, the general public is really hesitating. Once they are sick, should they take proprietary medicines, or should they see a doctor? In fact, it is not necessary. We only need to: (1) maintain normal health, (2) promptly perform vaccinations and various examinations, (3) know the source of the disease early, then we can treat it early and recover our health early. We advocate: a hospital should first serve society and second assist in promoting public health. But please take a look, which hospital is really heading in these two directions?</p>
<p>Finally, I want to state that the Gongji Hospital charges 35,000 yuan per day, and the Zhongmei Hospital charges 50,000 yuan per day, exceeding the fees of any private hospital. This is unavoidable. It is hoped that with the strength of society, we can assist hospitals in overcoming their difficulties, reducing fees, and benefiting the public!</p>
<h3>Strict Discipline</h3>
<p>— Fang Shan</p>
<p>On the sixth of this month, this publication printed an article titled "After Reading 'Inferiority Complex,'" which expounded on the feelings after reading "Inferiority Complex." The author meticulously diagnosed that inferiority complex is an extremely serious "psychological illness." The conclusion was: "Sincerity, politeness, and amiability are necessary, but they must be appropriate, generous, and don't turn yourself into a pitiful lamb!" This is indeed a precious proverb, a targeted and effective remedy for "inferiority complex sufferers."</p>
<p>The author attributes the cause of this "inferiority complex" to "old-style family education," saying that this education "has always aimed to teach children to be rigid and constrained..." This is also an incisive and undeniable argument. However, at this time, the golden signboard of ordinary schools, set as a policy—actually "to attract a wide clientele"—the four large characters "Strict Discipline" are glaringly present before my eyes.</p>
<p>The signboard is, of course, also an advertisement. The beginning of this advertisement is often like this: "Our school's curriculum is serious, the discipline is strict, and it has gained the trust of social figures." As for the ending, the writer of the draft, with heartfelt sincerity, may even write something like "Young students, why not come and prosper!"</p>
<p>The so-called strict discipline is actually nonsensical. Because if there is a strict aspect, there should also be a lenient aspect. Can education really be divided into two categories: strict education and lenient education? In reality, in the minds of those skilled in education, there will never be words like strict or lenient. They only pay attention to how to enable students to receive intellectual enlightenment, physical training, and moral cultivation through a reasonable life.</p>
<p>Just like the difficulty in distinguishing the real from the fake of "Lu Gao Jian" and "Zhang Xiaoquan," schools all over the world hang up a signboard of "Strict Discipline." As a result, parents who generally yearn for "strict discipline" are at a loss, feeling a sense of sighing at the "sign."</p>
<p>The true believers and practitioners of the "Strict Discipline" doctrine, when the trick is exposed, can be pitifully reduced to only two methods: one is "scolding," and the other is "beating." (However, there is ultimately an "ultimate weapon"—"expulsion," but due to space limitations, it is regrettable that it cannot be discussed.)</p>
<p>To meet the standard for scolding, it must be to scold "until the dog's blood sprays," such as "You are all trash," "You are all hooligans," and so on. Exceeding the level of scolding is beating. To meet the standard for beating, it must be to beat the students until their palms are swollen. However, there are two restrictions on "beating": one is that it cannot draw blood, because even parents who are believers in the "Strict Discipline" doctrine will not be able to bear the pain when they see their children being beaten to the point of bleeding, which will affect the reduction of customers in the second half of the year; the other is that they cannot beat older and taller students, because they may resist, and your physical strength may not be able to be their "wrestling" opponent.</p>
<p>As for the time of scolding and beating, it is nothing more than when students are unwilling to respectfully listen to the hypnotic lectures in class, or when they dare to skate and throw balls in the only little space available at school after class, or... in general, your mouth, hands, and feet must not move rashly or thoughtlessly. You should be quiet, you should be civilized, you should follow the rules, and that's good. If you want to move rashly or thoughtlessly, I will beat and scold you. How dignified and great to be able to beat! But being able to scold also counts as some dignity and greatness. "Elementary school students in junior high school are indeed afraid of me," this is the triumphant song of a scolding master.</p>
<p>Children have just jumped out of the pit of "Fen-style family education," but immediately fall into the net of this "Strict Discipline" doctrine, complete with beatings and scolding. As a result, their self-esteem, creativity, are rarely spared from being damaged, weakened, or even completely ruined.</p>
<p>Brief Collection</p>
<h3>Planning is not Difficult, Implementation is</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>The great Shanghai construction plan, in its preliminary stage, will expand the commercial district to Nanshi, and the intricate and maze-like narrow streets of Nanshi will all have to be demolished. Hankou Road will be widened to become a secondary transportation artery... I remember that not long ago, the authorities, merely to widen the surface of Boundary Road and Zhejiang Road, were inundated with petitions and complaints. If the great Shanghai construction plan is implemented, the situation will inevitably involve large-scale demolition of houses. Whether it can proceed smoothly is a question.</p>
<p>Looking at the weather forecasts from the observatory in the newspapers in recent days, it's like betting on big or small at a casino, betting big and it turns out small, betting small and it turns out big. Therefore, it makes people very suspicious. What day is being predicted? But to say that what the observatory publishes is completely unreliable is not necessarily true. I dare to guarantee that at least the temperature rise and fall reports are very accurate.</p>
<p>Up to now, it seems that match merchants have not yet loudly "cried for help," but I am afraid that the time is not far off. Look, doesn't everyone have a lighter in their hand?</p>
<p>A Miss who just flew in from Chongqing said repeatedly that she couldn't get used to living in Shanghai, and that Hong Kong has mountains and water and the scenery is good. But Chongqing also has mountains and water, so why is she unwilling to live there for a long time and insists on coming back every day?</p>
<p>The wife of the director in the Two Roads Bureau embezzlement case is said to still live in Shanghai and has repeatedly sent letters to the newspaper from this city to defend herself. I admire her courage. Is she not afraid of a household registration investigation?</p>
<p>The authorities stipulated that rice must be bought with a household card, allowing each person to buy five sheng. After that, everyone began to value their household card. "What is a household card?" Many people still don't know, isn't that ridiculous!</p>

<h3>Sent to the Deceased Wife Feng Jun (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>The children stayed at home for a total of four days and nights, enjoying the joy of being around your knees, which added a lot of lively atmosphere. Seeing that your old woman's condition had not improved, although they were reluctant to leave, because they each had their own matters to attend to in Shanghai, they had to say goodbye to you repeatedly with care. Although you were very sad in your heart, you deliberately did not show it. You only repeatedly told them to be careful in everything outside, and sent them away with a forced smile. I knew that you were smiling on the face but in pain in your heart, so I used skillful words and gentle analogies to comfort you.</p>
<p>On the third day after the children left, I remember it was the fifteenth day of the third lunar month, this cursed day. In the peony altar on the lawn, more than a hundred *yulouchun* magnolias and more than twenty purple peonies were in full bloom, vividly colored and fragrant, pleasing to the eye. Early in the morning, I picked three *yulouchun* magnolias, arranged them in a vase, and brought them to the small table next to your bed. When you saw the pink-tinged flower faces and smelled the delicate fragrance, you couldn't help but light up with joy. Taking advantage of the special light when getting up to comb your hair and make the bed, you still went to sit on the veranda for a while, first leaning on the rattan armchair for a few minutes to rest your mind, then asking me to help you to the peony altar to admire the peonies, each striving for beauty and vying for splendor. When you saw that you were as thin as firewood and your face was haggard, you began to sigh "Humans are not as good as flowers," and then, sadly unhappy, you went back to the room to rest, taking two steps as if glued together. The situation this afternoon was not bad. Originally, you had a cup of milk powder at four or five o'clock, but today you wanted to eat porridge, and you even ate two small pieces of braised pork. At half past seven, you had dinner as usual, although it was only a shallow bowl of thin porridge, it was not reduced. I thought this was an optimistic sign, and my heart relaxed by half. But unexpectedly, at about eleven o'clock that night, there was a sudden change. I was sleeping very sweetly in the black sweet countryside when I suddenly heard Mother Ye, who was staying in the same room, exclaiming repeatedly, "What's wrong with Madam? What's wrong with Madam?" I was awakened by this burst of shouting and hurriedly straightened up from your feet and looked at you. I saw your eyes rolled upwards, foam coming out of your mouth, and humming "Ooh... ooh... ooh..." for a while. I quickly placed my two pillows under your back and helped you up, repeatedly calling out, "Feng! Feng! Wake up quickly! Wake up quickly!" After a while, Bao Mei, Mother Ye, and Lian Er Xi Sheng all put on their clothes and got up, rushing over from the next room. Then everyone cried and shouted, pulling at hair and twisting *renzhong* points in a flurry. After a good while of chaos, you still didn't wake up and were still humming "Ooh... ooh... ooh..." I was so flustered that I didn't know what to do except cry and shout. Bao Mei had an idea and quickly woke up Shijing and told him to go and invite Doctor Wu immediately. However, Doctor Wu replied that he did not make house calls in the middle of the night. I asked him to invite Doctor Pang, who had initially introduced Doctor Wu, thinking that he could ask him to make an exception to come and save you in an emergency out of friendship. But the doorman said that Doctor Pang had gone to the countryside. Seeing you lying stiff and unresponsive in my arms, I just cried and shouted, not knowing what to do. I couldn't think of a way, so I had to ask my resourceful old friend Cheng Xiaoqing for help. I was sorry to have him get up from his warm bed and rush over. He thought that having Shijing go to invite Doctor Wu was not solemn enough and that I should go myself. Perhaps Doctor Wu would take pity on me and make a trip. Fortunately, the rickshaw that Shijing usually rented was parked at home. So he pulled me to Doctor Wu's house. In a short distance, we arrived in a moment. Doctor Wu heard my voice upstairs but still refused to come down. His wife also helped to refuse. I was filled with grief and shouted hoarsely, "Fine, just watch her die!" Then I sighed deeply and walked out of Doctor Wu's gate in despair. After walking only a few dozen steps, unexpectedly, an imperial edict flew down from the high building. It turned out to be Mrs. Wu's soft Wu dialect, saying, "Wait a minute, let Doctor Wu take a look!" Overjoyed, I thanked her repeatedly and returned to the gate to wait patiently for a while. When Doctor Wu came out carrying his medicine bag, I couldn't help but kneel down on the threshold and kowtow to him to show my gratitude. Then, Shijing's rickshaw pulled Doctor Wu back, and I followed behind the rickshaw, panting and taking quick steps. The moonlight was very good that night. Although there were no pedestrians, I was not afraid at all. While chanting the Buddha's name, I also called out to Jesus, asking them to rescue you. At this point, my mind was already confused.</p>

<h3>How Xu Jie Criticized Shen Congwen</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>For twenty years, Shen Congwen has always been like a scarecrow target, letting the arrows of criticism fly one by one, he rarely responds, his works themselves are the best response.</p>
<p>Political sectarianism has become the heaviest stumbling block on China's road to constitutionalism. In fact, this is not only true in politics, but sectarian and factional prejudices are even deeper in the literary world. If a writer does not have his own group, or even a small organization, then no matter how serious your attitude is, no matter how you have practiced the methods of realism, no matter how typical the characters you have created, you still cannot get fair treatment. In theory, realism is not a patentable commodity, and there should be no disputes over legitimacy, because it is a matter of creative method, and there is nothing to inherit. Although there is a great distance between Zola and Balzac, they are both naturalistic writers. The progress of modern material civilization is considerable, but it still has to rely on human thinking to produce literary works. In other words, since machines cannot manufacture stereotyped literature, realistic works will inevitably have diversity. Being able to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, the initial task of literary criticism is completed. If you only see the trees and not the forest, it is indeed the most dangerous tendency. If a work has pornographic elements, the critic needs to point it out, but to rashly consider it a pornographic work and obliterate its value is tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater, which is not the attitude a critic should have.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Jie once wrote three articles in a row, criticizing Shen Congwen's "Looking at the Rainbow Record," "Picking Stars Record," and "Stupid People." We are prepared to discuss the first of these.</p>
<p>"Do you like to read pornographic literature, friends! Then, let me introduce you to the "Looking at the Rainbow Record" in the first issue of New Literature." This is how the criticism begins. Ancient Chinese philosophers said, "The benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom." This is the most true truth, because objective existence is just that objective existence, constantly changing, but not changing according to our psychological state, but according to certain laws; we observe a thing at the same time, and the impressions and conclusions we get are not easily the same, because everyone's subjective is like a pair of colored glasses, so the benevolent only see benevolence, the wise only see wisdom. Mr. Xu Jie's soul is filled with pornography, so he can only dig up pornography in "Looking at the Rainbow Record." To put it bluntly, there is nothing mysterious about it. Freud, from the perspective of psychoanalysis, explains all human behavior as sexual behavior, which is the same principle.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Jie clearly does not have a deep understanding of that subjective monologue in the novel: the so-called "I live completely in a concept, not in the actual world," this is not a question of whether the author wants to do this or not, but that in the situation of "spending this time gazing at the clouds," a person has such an illusion. In fact, people cannot but live in the actual world, and there is no such possibility as living in a concept. "Poetry and fire both make life burn" is just a metaphorical saying. The so-called poetry and the so-called fire are both abstract or symbolic. It can be abundant vitality, or it can be the emotions aroused by a certain image in the outside world that is rich in beauty or stimulation. If fire is lust, then what kind of poetry is poetry? Is the fire stolen by Prometheus also lust?</p>
<p>It is a mistake to confuse the physical body and carnal desires. Praise of the physical body is not necessarily praise of carnal desires. Under certain circumstances, the physical body can be an objective existence like a work of art. The person who praises it only praises it from an artistic point of view, appreciating its lines, appreciating its complete and very symmetrical outline, appreciating its profound expression or natural posture. A healthy body originally means morality itself, so it is not only the most beautiful but also the most good. Great artists of all ages, such as Michelangelo and Rodin, have all used the human body as a model and studied it throughout their lives, gaining various inspirations from it to complete their artistic cultivation and personal cultivation. Only the lowest and most vulgar people are aroused by carnal desires when they see the physical body. They do not have the psychological basis to appreciate the physical body, let alone imagine how others appreciate and praise it.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Xu Jie believes that "Looking at the Rainbow Record" is pornographic literature, he still takes the trouble to copy it down section by section. This criticism is actually an abstract, extracting the parts that impressed him the most. Although his attitude is negative, if "Looking at the Rainbow Record" is really pornographic literature, then he has become a promoter of pornographic literature. A type of medicine for quitting opium used to be popular on the market, which was said to contain opium, but with some flour added. If "Looking at the Rainbow Record" is really pornographic literature, the function of this criticism can at best be equivalent to that kind of medicine for quitting opium.</p>
<p>Shen Congwen's hometown, Xiangxi, was originally a place where the Han and Miao ethnic groups lived together. As far back as forty or fifty years before the Anti-Japanese War, the tentacles of modern civilization had not penetrated due to the obstruction of mountains and rivers. Life there was still inseparable from pine torches, fire sticks, shamans, yellow paper charms, and wild boar skin drums. There still remained a part of the primitive and medieval customs. He grew up in a mythical environment, and the invisible influence was great. He yearns for simple love, pursues pure spiritual harmony and physical pleasure. His thoughts and his outlook on life, although there have been slight changes, are generally quite close to Epicurus's hedonistic philosophy. If this point is ignored, studying Shen Congwen is a waste of time and effort.</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>White-Clothed Angel</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>I almost forgot that I was convalescing in the hospital. I often chatted with Lishan from dinner until the quiet of late night.</p>
<p>However, Lishan finally went back first, to deal with her unfaithful "Flying Umbrella," leaving me alone, lonely, in a cold and desolate hospital room.</p>
<p>One pale cyan moonlit night, perhaps I was feeling bored? Standing by the window, gazing at the twinkling, shimmering sky, staring until my eyes ached, I then returned to the bed, turned on the bedside lamp, and was just about to go to sleep when, suddenly, there were a few soft knocks on the door.</p>
<p>"Come in!"</p>
<p>Thinking it was the old maid who came to recite "Amen" to me every night, I called out absentmindedly. But when the long, green-painted door softly opened, my eyes suddenly widened, and I saw a stranger!</p>
<p>However, the stranger could not be considered entirely unfamiliar, because she was wearing a white uniform and a white hat, the edge of the hat trimmed with a narrow black border. "Is she a newly arrived head nurse?" I thought, taking a step forward, nodding to her, and asking:</p>
<p>"May I ask your surname, Miss?"</p>
<p>"My surname is Xu. Don't you recognize me?"</p>
<p>"It seems I haven't seen you before. Perhaps I am just too careless," I said.</p>
<p>"No, you are not careless. You indeed have not seen me before. But I have known you for a long time. I have seen your photograph!"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Seeing her give me a mysterious smile, I couldn't help but feel a little surprised, and unconsciously took another step forward, carefully scrutinizing her.</p>
<p>It was a flat, round, ordinary face, with many red pimples amidst the slightly dark complexion, a slight bump in the middle of the nasal bridge, small eyes and mouth... not particularly beautiful, perhaps? But her figure was very petite and well-proportioned, neither too tall nor too short, neither too plump nor too thin, a belt tied around her slender waist, quite charming.</p>
<p>The hour was near midnight, the moonlight was good, and the pale cyan sky was very tranquil. I dragged a chair from the bedside to the window and invited her to sit. She was not shy and sat down.</p>
<p>Logically, I was a patient, and it shouldn't be surprising that a strange nurse came in to chat with me. However, at this moment, a cloud of suspicion suddenly surged in my heart. I felt that the nurse's attitude was somewhat strange. At the very least: she knew me; or perhaps, she had had some kind of relationship with me.</p>
<p>I felt my heart beating faster, standing in front of her, I was speechless.</p>
<p>"I already came to see you last night, but you were asleep," she said softly, after gazing at me quietly for a while.</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"I only returned from Beiping last Saturday, but I don't plan to stay here for long. As soon as I have a chance, I want to go to the interior," she added.</p>
<p>I nodded, still not answering.</p>
<p>"Last night I saw your name on the patient's card, and I was unspeakably excited! It's such a coincidence that I finally saw you!" Saying this, she suddenly gave me another mysterious smile, and then fell silent, no longer speaking.</p>
<p>The night deepened. The strange nurse stared at me silently like that. Several times I felt I couldn't restrain myself and wanted to ask her frankly how she knew me, but somehow, when I met her mysterious and somewhat terrifying gaze, I felt a slight chill and dared not speak.</p>
<p>It seemed a very, very long time passed before she stood up and walked towards the door. As she was leaving, she handed me something and said:</p>
<p>"There is someone you know inside here. When you see him, you may understand who I am!"</p>
<p>She went out, taking away that mysterious and terrifying gaze. I closed the door and returned to the bedside lamp, discovering that she had handed me a small commemorative album.</p>
<p>Sitting by the bed, I curiously opened the album.</p>
<p>On the first page, I saw a delicate painting, depicting a pile of beautiful white clouds, with an angel in white standing on the clouds, stretching out her arms and looking down at the earth. In the right corner of the painting, there were two lines of small pen writing:</p>
<p>"Dedicated to my love, the white-clothed angel in my soul!"</p>
<p>My fingers began to tremble. When I saw a name under the two lines: "Meiqi", I finally realized that this strange nurse was Meiqi's fiancée, Xu Xiangying!</p>
<p>I did not continue to browse. I remembered a distant story:—</p>
<p>Meiqi—yes, he was just a fifteen or sixteen year old boy then, wasn't he? But very slick, always grinning slyly, squinting his small eyes, stealing glances at us in front of the low wall of the Xiguang Middle School next door.</p>
<p>"Us" of course, were all girls, some about the same age as Meiqi, some younger than him, and some older. Like those of us in Senior High School Class Two, who were at least three or four years older than him.</p>
<p>At that time, several of the older girls were very afraid of the male students from Xiguang Middle School, because they were very bad. Once they learned someone's name, they would write mushy, anonymous love letters. So, when we saw someone peeking from next door, we would immediately run away, never daring to look back.</p>
<p>But we were not afraid of Meiqi, not only were we not afraid, but we were also a little fond of him. The reason we were not afraid, of course, was because he was much younger than us. He was indeed still a child. The reason we were fond of him was funny. It turned out that Meiqi, although a boy, had a girl's face, a long oval face, watery little eyes, and especially lovely, when he smiled, a deep little dimple would immediately appear on his left cheek, with a resemblance to the movie star Hu Die's smile.</p>
<p>I don't know from when, one of our classmates, who liked to give nicknames, gave Meiqi the nickname "Little Flowery Eyes." So, whenever Meiqi stood by the low wall, grinning slyly, stealing glances at us, everyone would softly call out: "Little Flowery Eyes! Little Flowery Eyes!"</p>
<p>Once, the school had spring break, and most of the students had gone home, leaving only me and six or seven students from out of town. That day, a classmate and I were strolling idly on the street, and saw a boy standing in front of a fruit store eating loquats. The classmate softly called out: "Look, Little Flowery Eyes! Look at Little Flowery Eyes eating loquats!"</p>
<p>Perhaps we called out a little loudly, Meiqi turned around and smiled at us, and then walked away.</p>
<p>It was on the very next day that I received a strange letter, unsigned, only writing one sentence: "May I ask, Miss, why do you call me Little Flowery Eyes?" (To be continued)</p>
<p>Long Serial</p>
<h3>Flying Together as a Pair (82)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>At first, Lihua did not agree, but Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian repeatedly pleaded with her, telling her that this would offend the local people, which would be very unfavorable to their opera troupe. Helpless, Lihua only agreed to acknowledge some adoptive fathers, but absolutely refused to make friends. Mrs. Mo also felt that Lihua was still young and that it was not yet time to make friends, so she used this reason to reject those younger ones. Although the younger ones were inevitably somewhat disappointed, because the older ones were bodyguards for Lihua, they dared not do anything to her.</p>
<p>Now Lihua could no longer be as carefree as she used to be in Beijing. Before, she sang opera at night, and Bai Da could read and do needlework during the day; now, she sang opera at night; during the day, she had to go to this adoptive father's house today; to that adoptive father's house tomorrow; she simply had no life of her own! She often envied Liyun, who was still very happy, even though no one was supporting her, she didn't need it. She always naively treated singing opera as a game. She was "playing" opera, unlike Lihua, who always felt like she was being played, and she herself was someone else's plaything. Therefore, Lihua was in pain, but Liyun was not!</p>
<p>Lihua's adoptive fathers were all old men around fifty years old, either officials or merchants. Among them, there was only one who was relatively young, around forty years old. He was a brigade commander of the Northwest Army stationed in Xuzhou. Rich, powerful, and with many wives. The other adoptive fathers, after the adoption, also paid respects to the adoptive mothers. Because Lihua was born pretty, the adoptive mothers also liked her very much, so things were still peaceful. Naturally, when the adoptive mothers were not around, the adoptive fathers could not help but become wanton, secretly hugging Lihua, and fooling around with her for a while. But they still had some sense of propriety. Only this brigade commander adoptive father never introduced Lihua to his wife, and Lihua never knew that she had an adoptive mother. Moreover, he was more wanton and more hands-on than others, without any sense of propriety.</p>
