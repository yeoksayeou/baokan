<h3>國軍分路進薄張坦　圍攻大同共軍全部撤退傅作義部乘勝繼續南進</h3>
<p>〔本報南京甘日電〕國軍正分路向張家口推進，共方在張坦附近難尚有若十兵力，但力薄勢難支撐，據開張家口方面，除已作破壞地準備外，並於十九日以市委名義，向全市十七萬人發出緊急號召，所謂市民積極參加「自衛戰」。又新華社張家口十九日電，已承認開攻大同之共華，業已全部撤退。</p>
<p>〔本報天津甘日電〕傳作義部十九日下午，攻克懸鎮後，現仍乘勝前進中，張家口方面傳共軍集結有三十萬人，惟已呈動搖之勢，業料國軍即可順利進入張坦。</p>
<p>〔本報北平甘日電〕北平行營參謀長王鴻韶，今就張家口及大同問題，答應記者詢問稱：國軍是否收復張家口，完全以常局命令是從，但在南京談判之無開展前提下亦非不可之事，惟所謂國軍已迫張家口，則完全無稽。熱境國軍已收復承德西北之豐甯，國軍行動尚未逾熱河邊邊境。記者繼問假使敢復張家口，需時若干？王氏稱，一星期雖短，但亦不至延長數月，國軍有此把握。關於共軍防守張家口兵力問題，王氏稱，堪可作野戰之兵力，約二萬多人。王氏並告記者，大同之團已解，共軍已喪失攻大同之力量，收復嗯繼續線南下之傳作義部，即可與大同守軍出擊之部隊，會師於大同附近。</p>
<p>〔本報北平甘日電〕某高級機關發言人，今對國軍已對張家口開始行動問題，宋加否認，並謂無何顯著發展，但情況有利國軍。渠謀言見體情況，但謂本月底可能有結果的重大消息發展，此間各軍事指揮機關之高級人員，接觸頻業。</p>
<p>〔本報北平甘日電〕張家口之戰，刻正醞釀中，青龍橋方面今日下午已將行總最後一批款濟物資四百九十噸，運至共區廟莊，此批政府承諾運往之物資，既經運畢，預料該處情勢，短期必趨緊張，但現雙方在動員階段，一週內或不致即發生大戰。據今日由張家口來平之行總人員朱塞安談，張坦正加緊疏散人口物資，現已成半空之城，張坦至廟莊及西行車，專供軍運，已停售客票，行嗯聯總俱因共軍正在動員，救濟物資亦無至各懸散發，現張坦增留行總職員二人，聯總職員三人，廟莊方面有總三人聯總一人。</p>
<p>〔本報本平甘日電〕執行部明日將派機赴張家口，接執行小組返，今日執行部會派機赴張坦轉達命名，該處轉場已破壞說不確。</p>
<p>〔中央莊北平甘日電〕張家口情勢緊張產中，據間軍調部派駐該處小組政府及美方電台，已被共軍迫令拆除，與此間尖卻運絡，軍調部方面如獲共軍同意，準備即派機將該小組接返北平。又悉軍調部正計劃另派一小組赴歸妥，可能由南浦目集畫，惟尚未正式決定。</p>
<h3>傳作義電毛澤東　盼共黨改變作風　澈底放棄武力參加政府</h3>
<p>〔本報北平甘日電〕十二戰區傳長官作義今發表「毛澤東·東電」，呼額和平，都三千餘言，氏謂因重團攻大同而使國軍不得不採取救援行動，集甯之役，共軍死二萬餘人之眾，毛澤東不應辭其咎，自釹包戰役，迄今一週間之血·皆教訓共黨，應有所認識與反省，從而改變過去作風，發掘新路綫，澈底放棄武力，參加政府，結束戰爭，政府決不欲與共黨作戰。最後傳氏希望毛澤東能在軍隊國家化，政治民主化前提下，立即參加政府，並推薦共黨或其他人接替傳氏職務〔中央社歸妥甘日電〕傳長官作義致毛澤東電文如下；延安毛澤東先生，溯自去年日本投降，你們舉選攻妥包，放出內戰的第一搶，愚魯如我者，當時還以爲這是你們一時的或一部份的衡動，決不會成爲你們黨的政策，故會於十月甘四日致電先生，作坦白憑切的呼願，但一年來的慘痛事實，竟證明這是你們經過長期準備的計劃，並不是一個偶然的錯誤，因而和商談永無結果，而全面戰事，乃日益擴大。最近由於你們背棄諾言，關攻大同，政府以和平解開的努力，均告絕總之後，本戰區國軍才迫不得已採取行動，救援大同，但這是悲痛的並不是快意的，其目的僅僅在於解救大同之關，解救大同二萬車民。然你們相信武力萬能，調集了十七個旅五十一個團之眾，企圖在集甯殉滅國軍，城郊野戰和慘烈巷戰，繼續達四畫喪，最後來你們終於潰敗了，當你們潰敗的前一天，延安廣播，且已宣佈本戰區國軍被你們完全包圍，完全擊潰，完全殉滅，但次日的事實，立刻給了一個無情的證明，證明被包圍被擊潰被殉滅的不是國軍，而是你們自跨所謂「參加二萬五千里長征」的賀龍所部，聶榮臻所部，以及張宗遜，陳正湘，姚喆等的全部主力我不相信這是一個軍事上的勝利，因爲誠如你們所說，本戰區國軍武器最劣，人數最少，戰力最弱，而好戰心理更不如你們，雖然失敗似乎是應該的，但我們沒有失敗，失敗的卻是你們，所以這不是一個軍事上的勝利，而必須稱之爲人民意志上的勝利。在這次戰後中，你們擺在戰場上屍體，至少在兩萬人以上，我們流著眼淚，已經將他們掩埋了，你們在潰退途中，因恐懼國軍追擊，竟至拼命奔逃，口鼻冒血，倒身路旁，比比皆是，這是一幅如何悲慘的圖畫，我不禁要問是誰殺死了他們？我按住心口問我自己，如果作戰，是爲了我個人私欲或一部份人的私利，那未就是我殺了他們，我是一個最大的罪人，我應該遭受天譴，如果他們是在你的錯誤領導之下，逞兵倡亂，禍國害民，那就是你殺死了他們，在夜間人靜時你應該受到的責備，受到全國人民的懲罰。現在確已盜壘一個階段，經過一年來的血的教訓你們因該有所警悟，重新檢討你們的政策，重新研究你們的路綫。一個代表人民的政黨，在決定政策時，無論如何應該問問人民，看他們最痛惡的是什麽，最需要的是什麽。今天人民所最痛惡的是交通破壞，戰事無已，所最需要的是和平，安定，休養，生息。雖然你敏一向宣傳民主，但人民不要戰亂，你們卻偏偏製造戰亂，人民害怕貧窮，你們偏偏以至高貧窮作爲擴大戰亂的資本，所謂民主云乎哉！你們又一再譭謗政府在人民心目中，是有功勞的，有威信的，絕不是任何毀謗所能動搖，即使政府今天存著若十缺點，需要改革，但人民厭惡你們製造戰亂，厭惡你們破壞交通，厭惡你們翻身算帳，較之要求政府進行若干改革，其輕重緩急，幾乎不可同日而語。因爲後者只是好與不好的比較，而前者卻是人民眼前能活不能活的難關，人民今日起碼的要求，只要能在和平安定中生活下去，決不奢望在你們的戰亂中再翻幾個拼死的斛斗，政府若干缺點所影響於人民生活的，較之你們破壞交通窮兵點武，所加給人民的苦痛和死亡，簡直是一與二萬倍之比，這還不現實嗎，還不明白嗎？人民如何同情你們，擁護你們？我們不妨再作一個假定，你們如果有力量，一舉而推翻現政府，建立起你們的新政權，不論儒民是否同意你們的政策，總還可以獲得一個安定，但是你們今天所賴以倡亂的武力，又不足以實現這個野心，據你們自己宣傳，估計至少還得十年，目前你們雖希望造成一個武力歌劇的形勢，來繼續鬥爭，這就是證你們準備繼續十年的鬥爭，十年的戰亂，在鬥爭戰亂之中，現有的各階層人民，非死於拋火，即死於飢餓，要他們完全毀滅，試問人民如何能同情你們十年的鬥爭？戰亂之後，各地無瞧類，又怎樣能實現你們的目的。因而你們十年戰亂的計劃，也就絕對沒有實現的可能，則以最近的事實爲例，本戰區國軍是你們認爲人數最少，武器最惡，戰力最弱的部隊，然你們竟一敗於釹包，再敗於大同，三敗於集甯，會戰，試問如何與其他精銳的國軍爲敵？你們或者選準備萬一割據不成，可以續山打遊擊，但內戰和抗日是完全不同的，抗日是人民一致的要求，所以你們可以假抗日之名，騙取人民的掩護。（未完待續）</p>

<h3>浙省第四行政區　決實施合作農場　分公地制與私地共營制</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州二十日電〕浙省第四行政區，決於今年實施合作農場。據該區李專員楚狂語本報記者，此項農場，分公地制與私地制共營制二種，前者供佃農，後者供地主與自拼農，每縣設立二處以上，全區約可成立二十餘所，均爲一百畝以上之小型農場，農民不必以全部田產加入，可留一部份自由生產，其已加入者仍標其界限，以便於退出時免起糾葛，因政府可供給種子，農具，以便其勞動生產，故李專員之觀察，農民參加者必多。現李氏正積極向省府及行總浙閩分署申請報給各種種子及小型農業機械，俾使浙江農業踏上集體生產之路。</p>
<h3>謝瀛洲談審奸工作　半年內可告段落　對滬參會建議當予重視</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕司迭行政部次長謝瀛洲，廿日對本報記者談：上海市參議會所提檢舉漢奸七項辦法，已於報端見及，政府對於民意機關之建議，自將予以重視。據稱：當局對於審奸工作，向極慎重，凡證據確實者，大部皆已審結，至今結束之案件，十九爲案情較爲複雜，且須向各地調閱證據者，蓋審奸工作較普通案件尤爲重要，自不能草率定奪謙。謝氏繼談及各地審奸工作，認一般情形尚可滿意，例如首都高院自本年四五月以來，所審理之漢奸案件即不在少數，其他上海·北平·廣州等地亦皆積極進行。據謝氏估計，審奸工作半年內可告一段落。關於大赦事，手續已完成，僅待政府公佈實施日期，惟漢奸與貪污並不在被赦免之列。</p>

<h3>民選縣長</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>邱吉爾鼓吹法德合作</h3>
<p>英國前任首相邱吉爾，前天在瑞士沮列希大學發表演說，主張剝奪德國一切重整軍備之機會，但法德兩國應輝嫌修好，以法德合作爲基礎，建立歐洲聯盟。他說：「重建歐洲的第一步，必須由法德共同合作，惟有如此，法國始能恢復其在歐陸的領導權；若無偉大的德國，歐洲即不能復興。」</p>
<p>邱氏現雖退出政界，息影瑞士，但以其本人的聲望而論，他的言論主張，仍爲各國所重視；預料邱氏的演說，又將引起各國輿論界的軒然大波。緣在本年三月間，邱氏在美國福爾登城發表演說，希望將來世界和平能建立在英美兩大戰勝國友好合作的基礎上，曾引起世界各國與論界的批評；尤其是蘇聯各報，莫不指責邱氏懷有反蘇聯的陰謀。這次邱氏的演說，必然的，又將引起各國的反響。</p>
<p>我們站在第三者的立場，平心靜氣，分析今日歐洲的政局，，即可知：締造歐陸的和平與秩序，在法德之間的世仇，確乎宜解不宜結。這次在東方人的觀念看來，尤覺得理應如此。爲歐陸和平計，同時也爲法國的前途計，法國實不應再以報復手段加諸德國，或對德國提出種種過分苛刻的要求。否則？德國人民將永遠不會消除「報仇」的心理，而循環報復，戰亂何能用彌？至期望法德兩國共同合作，以建立歐陸聯盟的權構，那就更根本談不到了。人類是理智的動物，最能接受歷史的教訓。誰也不能否認，不問法國將以何種苛刻的條件加諸德國，即使能束縛住德國於一時，使其不能翻身，但是終非一勞永逸之計，稍隔若十年月之後，被束縛者懷恨在心，又將由乘隙尊襲之一日。法國遠見的政治家對於這一層，必定能洞悉其中的利害得失。以中日兩國而論，我國所受日本的壓迫，侵略，蹂躪與侮辱，實在是罄竹難書，戰時中國人民對於日本人，更是切齒痛恨到極點。但一旦戰爭結束，中國味遠東和平的百年大計著想，仍採取寬大爲懷的態度，不顧以報復政策對待日本。所以在我們中國人民的眼中看來，認爲法德之間，應無不可解除的仇恨。而且這種民族間的世仇。長此存在，足使雙方彼此企圖報復，不惜引起戰禍。法德之間的積不相容，互相敵視，近百年來，不知釀成了多少次的戰禍。所以我們也認爲歐洲和平如能建立在鞏固的基礎上，則法德兩國的釋嫌言好，實爲一不可缺少的因素。</p>
<p>但是邱吉爾在最近的一年內，先後發表了好幾次演說，一次在美國，主張英美合作；又有一次在法國，主張英法同盟；這一次在瑞士，又主張法德合作。把他這些主張聯合起來，當不免要令人懷疑到邱氏有組織西方集團以抵抗蘇聯的企圖。我們不僅希望國際和平，而且更盼望聯合國各國，尤其是英美法蘇等國，均能通力合作，共同締造世界和平。所以對於國際上企圖組織集團以反抗對另一集團的任何計劃，我們都不能隨便附和。在邱吉爾的演說中，有沒有這種企圖？確實是值得大家研討的問題。</p>
<h3>寺廟僧衆何必誤會？</h3>
<p>本市若干寺廟的和尚約五六百人，一眸結隊向市參議會請願。錄本市參議會於十七日大會席上，通過「請市府配撥自治機構辦公房屋以利推行自治案」，其中五項辦法中之第二項有「撥用或借用寺廟及公共建築物」的規定，至引起僧衆不安。查此案前在市參議會席上，曾經王宋議員正延等力爭取消撥用二字，乃修正爲「撥用或借用」始能獲通過。此案竟引起僧衆的誤解，殊出意外。</p>
<p>自治機構沒有房屋辦公，我們同情；自治機構不能因爲沒有房屋辦公而隨便以別人之私產。固然，寺廟中不乏私產，且有主持管理，但也有若干寺廟，或當其建築之初，即集眾人之資，或就其性質而言，原爲地方與建之公產，似不可一概而論。誠如王參議員在參議會上所稱，「一般人士與建寺廟自有其用意，而公共建築亦自由其用途；自治機構，不應聲請撥用」，但經市參議會修正爲撥用或借用以後，自可無比流弊。假使此寺廟原歸地方公產，或現已成爲廢祠荒宇，則化無爲有用，暫撥糧公未嘗不可。假使全爲私產，則借用之際，允借與否全有自由，絕無霸佔盜用之可虞。更談不到侵奪產權，妨礙法益。寺廟僧眾，茍能細辯，何用張皇？</p>
<p>至謂寺廟性質，不僅限於佛寺，即其他宗教禮拜之場所，如基督教之禮拜堂，回教之清真寺，亦包含在內，似此規定，恐滋紛擾。照我們看來，亦是張大其詞。查信教自由，原爲基本人權，載在國家根本大法。信教自由，包括有與建及保有爲宗教信仰所必需之建築的自由，除非有遠害善良風俗的宗教，信教自由不受剝奪。寺廟爲宗教信衆所必至的地方，自有禁止寺廟封閉寺廟之理。而禮拜堂清真寺等，則更不相干。須知政府當局前所布告禁止者，乃保護寺廟，不准擅自搗毀神像，封閉廟宇，而非不准撥用或借用公產寺廟，以與辦有益公眾之事業，且更牽涉不到一切宗教信徒信仰自由的基本權利。若說寺廟只許禮拜，不作別用，則民國以來，借用佛殿辦學，到處皆然，而各地邑廟，文廟，岳廟，關帝廟等等，設置文教事業或普通商場者，也隨時可見，豈獨有辦理地方自治之機構，反不能商借暫用之理？總之，產權屬於公者可撥用，產權屬於私者，祗能商得同意後借用。如此，則與寺廟之主權無關，而僧衆更無須愁其屋宇之被攘奪。明明決議案情有「借用」字樣，則四大皆空的和尚們，就使固執寺廟爲「已有」，其產權亦絲毫並未動搖，何以反致執著大起恐慌呢？太虛法師龔，案稱佛門賢達，識解當自不凡，高瞻遠矚，必懸善言。</p>

<h3>美總統支持貝爾納斯　要求華萊士去職　聲明外交政策保持不變</h3>
<p>華氏儘可以平民資格自由發揮意見</p>
<p>貝爾納斯　杜魯門　華萊士</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十日號外廣播：杜魯門總統頃宣佈；渠已要求一華萊士提出辭職，並謂渠絕對擁護貝爾納斯之外交政策，該項政策迄無變更。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎二十日緊急廣播華盛頓訊：杜魯門總統今日係在招待記者會議席上發表要求華萊士辭職之事。杜氏宣稱：美國政府應在外交政策上團結一致，此番要求華萊士去職，誠屬遺憾，但當華氏以平民地位行使其發表見解之權利時，當必更感愉快也。杜魯門繼重申國會。總統與國務院所會同決定之外交政策現仍有效，此後無一政府官員可對業已確立之外交政策公開發表牴獨性之聲明。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三十日電〕杜魯門總統與現在巴黎之貝爾納斯國務卿，昨藉無線電打字機，就華萊士事件交換意見歷二十分鐘，傳總統即將發表有關外交政策之宣言。聞貝爾納斯對於華萊士事件之關心，並未因杜總統之暫時勸阻華氏發言而减少。渠覺菲由總統發表乾脆之聲明，以表明其係支持貝爾納斯抑華萊十，不能完全消滅目前之不安狀態。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕本日獲悉：商務部長華萊士表示，除非社魯門總統准其討論外交政策，渠已拒絕參加民主黨國會選舉運動。據稱，星期三社魯門與華萊士會談時，杜總統請商務部長繼續發表演說，但以討論國內問題爲限。但華萊士拒絕將其演說範圍加以限制。</p>
<h3>華萊士演說左向　邱吉爾演說右向　動機相同結果逈異　二人均承認對蘇衝突危機</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕邱吉爾今日在瑞士之沮利希大學發表演說，主張以法德合作爲基礎，以建立歐洲合衆國。預料此一演說，將在倫敦及世界各地引起軒然大波，不亞於美國商長華來士在一星期前所發表之演說。此間觀察家認爲邱翁此一演說，爲今日西方民主國外交政策之絕端主張。華萊士主張不可對蘇聯强硬，而邱吉爾則主張法德携手，與英美合作以建立堅强之集團，抗阻蘇聯。邱翁之意，在將貝文與貝爾納斯現行外交政策再度推之向右，正與華萊士之企圖推之向左相反。然邱翁之演說不致使英政府陷入甚窘之地位，蓋邱吉爾固反對黨之領袖，與華萊士之係現任閣員殊不相同也。邱翁之「及時重建德國，遲恐不及」之主張，與貝文之主張大相逕庭。英工黨之左派份子從此當不再指責貝文之步邱吉爾後塵，故貝文在工黨內之地位，反可因此增强，</p>
<h3>邱吉爾返英</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎二十日廣播倫敦訊：邱吉爾偕夫人女公子，下午三時半搭瑞士飛機抵達碧琴山機塲。此與華萊士演說之意在分裂民主黨，並削弱貝爾納斯之地位，用意及結果均不相同。邱吉爾此一演說之中心思想，不過在宣示與蘇合作決不可能而已。自旁觀者之地位觀察，經騐豐富若邱吉爾者，決不致不知在目前遽即創導德國應使恢復歐洲領導地位說，能不引起蘇聯之極大懷疑。邱吉爾與華萊士兩篇演說之動機，均爲承認　蘇聯衝突之危險，使對於如何防止一點，兩人之結論不相同耳·</p>
<h3>法國人士頗爲震驚</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十九日電〕當晚報揭載邱吉爾在沮利希發表之演說，主張法德携于以重建歐洲大家庭後，大部份讀者感覺異常之震駕。法官方尙未評論，惟高級官員之私人交談，則對邱翁之建議均表示懷疑。政界人士亦有認其意防止德國投入蘇聯懷抱者。共黨人士則稱，此乃建立反蘇西方集團之又一審試·</p>
<h3>和會插曲　爲窗戶關閉問題　蘇南成立「妥協」</h3>

<h3>義南邊界及特港問題　仍維持四強決議　各種修正案均遭否決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十日電〕和會今日擁護美英法蘇四國關於義南邊界及將來特里埃斯特自由邦邊陲之協議。和會義大利政治與領土委會一再付請表決，將主張修改邊界之每次努力逐一擊敗。四國忠於義務，均投票反對修改，即使修改辦法包涵四國之原意亦不予贊同。南斯拉夫副總理卡台琪堅持其前稱南國決不簽訂其認爲「不公允」之條約等語，錄入委員會紀錄。委會對於改變四國所定特港國際化自由區邊陲之建議，共投票表決十一次，除一次外，均以十三票對五票否決，波蘭，捷克，白俄羅斯，烏克蘭，站於南期拉夫方面，阿比西尼亞與比利時棄權。南非建議擴大特里埃斯特區，包括義國波拉等城。白俄羅斯與南斯拉夫所提修正建議，將義南邊界更向西移入義境，並將自由邦區域展至特里埃斯特域區邊緣。捷克爲避免僵局起見，提議設立小組委會，設法求取「穩固解決辦法」，但以十票對七票被否決。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京二十日電〕美要求蘇聯供給其日本佔領區內解除武裝之情報，蘇迄未照辦，美代表爰亦表示不願以盟軍總部管制區域之情報供給蘇聯。四國管制日本委員會本月十八日開會時，美蘇代表曾就此一問題引起激辯。是日午前會議時，蘇聯代表特萊夫揚柯發言，懷疑美國利用日本復員局，（即前陸海軍省改組）刺探關於蘇在遠東軍事準備之情報。並要求說明日本之軍事能力與情報，何以由美國人秘而不宣，管制委員會主席美代表艾其森報告日本復員情形及復員局之工作，但特氏對此種報吿表示不滿，堅決要求知悉日太各海軍基地與沿海防禦工事之「摧毀與建設」情形。艾其森認爲此言並非指日本各港口所進行之和平建設活動，拒絕續加討論。含怒答曰：此際絕對無所謂日本海軍基地建設問題，一言以蔽之，蘇聯對盟軍總部管制區解除日武裝情形，將不能獲得任何詳細情報，一如蘇聯本身不欲供給關於其管制區域如庫頁島及韓北之情報然。盟軍總部要求蘇聯當局供給此項情報，前後凡五次，但均未獲得，美國不得不亦拒供情報，以資報復。</p>
<h3>中日兩國物價　計劃相互交換</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京十九日電〕中國駐日代表團稱：中國正從事硏究日本之經濟，俾知日本可在如何之範圍以內，以工業製品與中國交換原料，此乃中日相互繁榮計劃之一部份。目前尙未完成。</p>
<h3>土耳其人愛貓不愛狗　貓瞇充塞街頭　野狗都驅逐出境</h3>
<p>〔聯合社土耳其伊斯丹埠十九日電〕此間之貓，十分繁殖，較其他城市爲多。致無統計，但就所見，貓敬處街頭，充塞水溝，阻斷公寓房子的石階，可以證明伊斯丹埠成爲貓的樂園。其原因爲狗太少，三十年前，地方常局曾將流浪的狗放逐於茂馬拉海荒島中，荒島中不得食物，又不能接近大陸，此種狗惟有自相吞食，揣想起來，剩下最後的一條狗，也不免餓死，現在島上恐已無狗，而徒有「狗島」之名。伊斯丹埠成爲貓的世界，此少數之狗反小心翼翼，低聲下氣，以免觸犯貓怒。據市政府管狗科報吿：六月份「處置」野狗一百三十七條，面被處置的貓祗有七頭。土耳其人不歡喜狗，而珍視貓，於此可見。</p>
<h3>美陸海軍部否認　計議攻蘇聯　華萊士所言絕無根據</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十九日電〕美國陸軍部長柏德遜與海軍部長福萊斯特頃聯名函呈杜魯門總統，對於商務部畏華萊十所謂美國軍界思想家主張以「先發制人」手段加諸蘇聯一節，鄭重予以否認，此函內容，昨夜已由白宮發表，內稱，「華萊士部長前於八月廿三日上總統一函，已由今晨各報轉載，據云在蘇聯保有原子炸彈之前，即向之進攻之語，絕無根據。美國方面不論在陸軍部或在海軍部均無此種思想，吾輩咸知海陸兩軍之負責軍官，從無此種主張，亦未計議進攻蘇聯政策或計劃」。</p>
<h3>國際法上大使代表元首　日皇應代受其罪</h3>
<p>日前駐德大使大島辯護人稱　草場中將解日途中暴卒</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京二十日電〕美國名律師克寗漢甫自紐倫堡來此，擔任日戰犯即前駐德大使大島浩之法定辯護人。克氏昨日在庭上聲稱：國際法庭倘不審判日皇，即不能審判大島，因依照國際公法，大使代表一國之元首，大使即在解職之後，仍受外交特權之保護。任何攻擊，凡直接針對大使者，即被認爲攻擊其元首。法庭旣以國際公法爲基礎，自應尊重此種特權，若謂日皇無罪，大島亦即無罪，若謂大島有罪，應受審判，則日皇亦應受審判云。克氏雖言之成理，但庭上拒絕此項申訴，決定大島仍留被吿席候審。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京二十日電〕國際法庭蘇聯檢察團今日通吿美當局，謂日本草塲中將，自中國東九省押解來此，以便出庭作證，已發現中毒斃命，若非自殺，定係被暗殺，即將實行騐屍。聞蘇聯自東九省解來日人二十名，自加看管，與溥儀來日時相同，草塲即二十人之一，此人來歷不詳，美國諜報部得報，立即着手偵査。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京二十日電〕國際法庭檢察官今日首先提出日樞密院對締結德日防共協定之審査報吿，係於防共協定簽訂前五日，即一九三六年十一月二十日，由樞密院副議長荒井健太郞向議長平沼提出者。內稱蘇聯經二次五年計劃，國力充實，於遠東則準備龐大軍事設備，於歐洲則調整諸隣邦間外交關係，其國際地位漸臻鞏固，與蘇聯表裏相依之共產國際，擴其勢力於中國蒙滿等地，刻日本外交所遭遇之最大問題厥惟警戒蘇聯共產國際。一九三七年七月廿八日，德外長致駐日德大使密電，表示蘆溝橋事變後·日軍繼續進佔華北，妨礙中國之統一，助長共產主義之蔓延，表示不滿。上述德國之政策，俟南京失陷後，爲之一變，轉爲全面支持日本侵略中國。中日戰事進入新階段。德在中日事變之第一階段，係絕對守中立者。</p>

<h3>市府預算及市長交議案　今日提出大會商決　通過消滅碼頭竊風統一水警職權　大會延期下星期一休會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）今日市參議會上午舉行第十九次會議，將討論市府預算及市長交議案。關於跑馬問題亦將提出大會討論，届時情形熱烈，當在預料之中。下午大會仍將繼續討論提案。</p>
<p>參議會第一届第一次大會原定今日結束，惟因待討論之提案尙多，昨由潘議長提出經大會通過，決延期至下星期一（二十三日）休會。星期日下午因會塲無空間，休息一天。</p>
<p>又密査市長施政報吿，昨經大會通過每組推派代表一人共同審査。第一組朱文德，第二組姜屛藩，第三組路式導，第四組王先靑，第五組汪竹一，第六組童行白，第七組水祥雲，第八組龐京周，第九組徐永祚，第十組陶百川。</p>
<p>昨日上午，參議會舉行第十六次會議，九時四十分開始，出席參議員九十二人。由秘書長宣讀上次會議紀錄後，討論警字一至六號提案，最後並通過臨時動議一件。</p>
<p>臨時動議案係楊管北等所提：「統一水上警察職權，以專責成，而杜竊風，一，電請行政院及財政部，明令規定江海關港口警察署，專爲海關緝私而設，除査緝漏稅私貨外，不得越權處理水上竊盜及違警等案件。二，電請政府明令取消江海關港口警察署所轄巡丁公司，以根絕其藏垢納汚之隱患·三，上海市區以內，水面治安，應統由上海市警察局水上分局担負其責任，行使其職權，所有達成此項任務所必需之人員與設備如巡艇等，應充分配備之」。</p>
<p>首由楊管北氏加以說明，江海關港口警察署，原係負責緝私工作，水上竊盜及違警案件，統由水上警察分局負責。但行政院不了解此種歷史眞相，乃下令江海關警察署兼管水上治安。以致本屬上海市政府的黃浦江，變成「租界」。本席參加上海港務委員會後，得知碼頭竊案所以不能肅淸，癥結即在於此。因爲職權關係，水陸雙方都不合作，港口成了兩不管地方，誰也不負責，而偷竊則有組織，大規模的進行。所以擬請行政院，將黃浦江水上治安工作，移交上海市政府專責辦理。王延松，王先靑等參議員，繼續加以說明。最後表決，以九十四票通過。</p>
<p>警字第六號提案，與臨時動議有相當速帶關係。案由係：特設碼頭督察處，監督海關及水警行政案。並由王劍鍔提出：碼頭警政由市府辦理，提高水上警察服務道德，統一碼頭小工服裝等項辦法·大會決議，送請市府參考。</p>
<p>義務警察　加強組訓</p>
<p>警字第一號提案：擬請加强組訓義務警察，並成立自衛隊，以增保安力量。由大會補充審査意見通過，歸納爲下列三點辦法：一義務警察，係根據法令組織，以補警力之不足，應加强組訓，並於郊區擴充，配發相當槍械，以周分佈，而資保衛·二，自衛隊旣爲中央明令組織，屬於自治範圍，自應依法辦理。三，保衛團已失法令依據，毋須恢復。</p>
<p>警字第二號提案，補充通過。修正後案由爲「擬請市政府加強消防設備，提高消防人員服務道德，以重火政，而策安全案」。參議員對救火員服務道德，極爲重視。袁召辛稱：若干時前，華德路某五金號失火，火焰正盛時，救火員擬向老闆娘勒索四千萬元。促請當局予以注意。辦法共有五項。其中第四項係「在本年度市府預算內，列入國幣十億元，專供補充消防器具之用。對於滬雨，滬西，滬北，浦東四區民辦之義勇消防，應由市府予以補助。</p>
<p>整飭警察風紀　糾正巡捕觀念</p>
<p>警字第三號提案，案由辦法修正後，以七十八票通過。係「擬請市政當局整飭警察風紀案」。其中第三項辦法有「曾任舊租界之警士，應糾正其已往「巡捕」之錯誤觀念」，有人提議「巡捕」下應加「包打聽」字樣，因過去之包打聽，對老百姓往往拳足交加，殊爲惡劣。費樹聲表示異議稱：「巡捕或包打聽不過是一種名稱，有好也有壞。」結果本項辦法，修正爲「曾任舊租界之警士，應加緊訓練，糾正其錯誤觀念，其素質不良者，應予淘汰。」二一兩項辦法，係關於提高警士待遇及資格。第四項辦法爲「警士對人民應態度和平，其有蠻橫及敲詐情事，應儘量使人民檢舉，如有濫用職權，藉端包庇，拘禁人民，應嚴予懲處，及上級應受連帶處分。」</p>
<p>警字第四號，係「擬請本市警政當局注意本市當前應行興革事項案。」大會決議，連帶原提案，送請市政府參考。共有三項辦法：一，查禁私娼烟毒。二，加强交通管制。三，肅淸扒竊小偸。女參議員陸惠民稱：「私娼不應和烟毒相提並論，査禁之後，讓她們到那裏去呢？應該和扒竊小偷一樣，對她們實施感化敎育。」但大會中並無反響。</p>
<p>敵偽痕跡　滬南憲兵隊　全祿牌香烟</p>
<p>警字第五號提案，爲「請市府通令所屬各局處，並通知駐在各機關注意，淸除本埠各處所留敵偽痕跡案。」鍾玉良登台加以說明，言詞態度，滑稽突梯，滿堂哄笑。渠稱：「這事情雖小，但意義很大。例如思南路的憲兵隊</p>
<p>討論財政地政提案　免徵書業營業稅　發還敵偽圈佔民田</p>
<p>下午第十七次會議，首先討論財政地政方面的提案。</p>
<p>二房東要不要取締？周濂澤認爲上海的情形事實上二房東不能取締，因爲有些房子一戶可住十幾家，大房東勢不能與每一家都訂契的，所以應該取締的祗是二房東額外需案的情形。討論結果。修正爲一對於二房東額外需索及陋習應請市府從嚴禁止。」</p>
<p>張一渠季灝提議的書業應免微營業稅一案，李文杰發表意見說原則上很同意，祇恐影響到市府預算收入。蔣紀周則認爲不必顧慮到預算，因爲書業有關國家民族敎育文化事業，政府應予有力扶植。張中原等亦贊同此意，全塲一致無異議通過。</p>
<p>促請政府迅予發還敵偽圈佔民田一案，張學濂認爲提案語氣還要加車，他說：「上次臨參會已提出請市府切實辦）理，但是直到現在依然如故，人民的意思最好拖住市長馬上就做。」龐京周就提議請市長即席答復，究竟此事是否可以實行？市長的態度非常爽快，他站起來說：「本案所指的是飛機塲的民田，已經囑地政局在淸査了。査請以後就可以呈請中央辦理，如果大會通過請市府迅速切實辦理，那我一定迅速切實辦理！」本案就在參議員們滿意的掌聲中通過。</p>
<p>此外通過的提案有：（一）房屋無加租之必要案，（二）請市府切實辦理建築各區平民村以安民居案，（三）敵僞遺留之華中工房擬改爲平民村案，（四）査明市區內之荒廢公產，擬具造產辦法呈准施行以炎利用案，（五）請地政當局變通郊區未經淸丈及遺失單契之土地，並補發所有權狀案，（六）請地政當局對於尙未完成淸丈製圖之區域先辦淸丈，再辦登記案，（七）請地政當局對於無法分開之共有土地恢復虛錢圖辦法以免糾紛案，（八）請地政當局恢復戰前推收辦法縮短時間以利土地交易案，（九）請市府調整重複機構改善移轉過戶等手績以增進土地行政效率案。</p>
<p>保留的提案有（一）房屋分配委員會應有人民團號代表參加案，（二）、規定房屋定期租約之原承租人有優先承租權案，留待第十組房屋租賃法規案提出時一併討論。（三）請財政局停止徵收保　團服裝費以輕市民負担案，留待預算案提出時一併討論·掛着「滬南憲兵隊」字樣。過去敵憲也稱滬南隊，我們現在看見，終不免感到有點怵目驚心。爲什麼不用「南市憲兵隊」呢？這時他從袋中摸出兩包全祿牌香烟稱：「全祿牌捲烟，爲敵人製品，經濟品接收以後，爲甚麼不加改革？藉敵方招牌牟利，實在是可痛可恥。」他說完以後，把　包全祿牌香烟，送給了議長。最後大會決議：送請市府辦理。</p>
<p>晋京代表團　人選已決定</p>
<p>前日參議會中通過建議政府從速改善金融案，並決定推派代表十一名晋京請願。昨日上午潘議長提出擬定之名單：徐寄廎，奐玉書，王延松，駱淸華·陶百川，金潤庠·劉靖基，兪佐庭，徐國懋，楊撫生，王先靑等十一人。議長讀畢，陶百川請求退出，並推舉徐永祚。議長稱：「請求退出不好的，大家都要求退出怎麼辦？還是請大家表決吧！」結果，大會照原擬名單通過。</p>
<p>撥用寺廟問題　張曉崧發表談話</p>
<p>關於市參議會自治機關撥用寺廟房屋一案，昨據民政處長張曉崧發表書面談話謂：「査市參議會此項提案，係由參議員姜屛藩等提出，經第一組審査會審査決定各項列舉辦法，常討論時，本人以市府列席人員之資格，說明目前本市自治機關房屋困難情形，至撥用寺廟房屋一節，依監督寺廟條例之規定，凡無主管理少廢寺廟等，自可撥用，故所謂撥用，係指依法撥用而言，本市佛敎會實未了解此點，誤認所有寺廟，均在撥用之例，而致有請願一之事發生云。」</p>
<p>警察局施政報吿　通過決議案草案　注重人民　身體自由</p>
<p>參議會昨日上午以八十七票多數通過「對於上海市警察局施政報吿之決議案草案」。文字方面，由大會秘書處整理，並歸納各參議員之附加意見。草案中所提示之意見，分爲九方面：治安，人事，刑事，組訓，禁烟，消防，風化，市容，及交通。關於刑事方面，特別提出人身自由問題。因本市各警察分局所，間有拘束人民身體自由，未盡依法行爲。大會決議，此後除竊盜綁案有偵査必要，及現行犯須立予逮捕外，普通刑事案件，非有重大情節，而認犯罪眞實，有逃亡之虞者，不得加以拘繫。應令逕向法院吿訴。即認有傳詢交保必要，亦應隨時移請法院辦理。關於違警事件，應隨到隨辦。至於目前各方矚目之交通問題，決議增設停車塲，並査照戰前辦法，重行劃分區域行駛，嚴格檢査車身云。</p>
<p>上海水泥廠工人請願　大會請當局合理解決</p>
<p>昨日上午，參議會散會前五分鐘，潘議長請朱學範報吿接見龍華華商上海水泥廠工人請願經過。朱氏稱：「本人奉命接見全體請願工人，現在這個問題非常嚴重。龍華華商上海水泥廠當局，在十七日（星期日）乘工人不在廠工作，貼出停工的佈吿。十八日晨，工人們去上工的時候，廠門口警察密佈，停了兩輛紅色警備車，駕着機關槍，阻止工人進廠。幸而工人頗有理智，沒有鬧出意外來。我們知道，爲了維持社會安寗，政府早有明令：工人不得隨意罷工怠工，廠主不得隨意關廠及解僱工人。這是根據社會部解決勞資糾紛的四項原則，和市長所定的五項辦法。本席最後提出一個臨時動議：請社會局對龍華水泥廠糾紛迅速合理解決。」最後，大會通過了一個決議案：「請市府分飭社會局警察局依法辦理。」</p>
<p>通過衛生提案</p>
<p>衛生方面第一號提案請市府改進一般環境衛生案經討論修正後通過辦法五點：（一）請市府即將同仁輔元堂騐屍所設法移至郊外或與膠州路騐屍所合併。（二）請將市區內之寄柩所移設郊區，現在寄柩所之靈柩責令寄柩家屬領圖掩埋，否則由衛生局擇地深理，但須樹立標誌。郊區曝露屍棺，允應定期促令掩埋。（三）增加郊區水池擴展自來水管。（四）請市府增設里弄便池垃圾箱並協同各區公所督飭保甲長厲行淸潔運動檢査里弄整潔。（五）請嚴密檢騐自來水源並加改善。</p>

<p>第三號請市府修理糞車嚴令淸除糞便須在每晨八時之前，並禁止隨便傾倒糞便案，及第四號請市府澈底淸除本市垃圾案，第五號恢復郊區菜塲案均無異議通過。</p>
<p>第六號請市府推行本市市民之血型檢定案由原提案人范守淵解釋意義後，決議送衛生局參考。</p>
<p>房地產不能作抵　銀錢業要求改善</p>
<p>因時間關係，衛生一方面提案之討論到此爲止。最後議長提出一臨時動議，係銀錢業同業公會及錢商業同業聯名公會來函申述因房地產不便作爲押放款之祖保品以來，本市工商業之復興建設蒙受甚大阻力，亟望能有所改善，請參議會核議分別向山央及市當局建議，來函中臚列癥結五點，經大會討論後決定將所述第四點「銀行法草案對銀行承受不動產後至重行出售之最長期限僅以一年爲限，優良之担保性質爲之减色。」及第五點「中交農等銀行對工商業融通資金皆不允以不動產爲担保·」兩點轉達中央並交由此次選出之晋京請願團團員則作請願要件之一。</p>
<h3>跑馬廳外史　昔日一片荒凉而今寸地黃金</h3>
<p>吳稚老追溯往事　娓娓動聽　如同一夢　西藏咱畔風景畫周涇浜頭小茶寮　吳市長認爲　二年內收回　有可能性</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕兩星期的市參議會，快到了「尾聲」的一幕，參議員們對於「跑馬」這案子在大會外也已談論了十多天了。道些「馬」究竟要不要「跑」？在今天就可以明白分曉？記者爲使大家在未下決定之前，明瞭跑馬廳眞相起見，前曾訪問被譽爲「跑馬廳掌故專家」的陳參議員存仁，承他把跑馬廳的掌故原本吿訴記者發表。（載於十五日本報）可是他唯恐書本上的紀載也許有失實之處，又於前幾天分頭訪問幾位上海書宿，並與吳市長作了一番硏究。這裏記者又得到了一些補充的材料：</p>
<p>經陳參議員徵求吳稚暉老先生意見的結果，他老人家也是反對在市中心區（即現在跑馬廳）跑馬的。他說：在五十年前現在的西藏路叫做周涇浜，洋人名爲護界路，那時候這條路是一條浜，浜的寬度是多少呢？據說是可以通行兩條能裝米五十擔的大船。除了在現在新世界原址有一個三間小屋的茶館外，浜的兩旁完全是一片荒凉。英國人在「泥城之戰」後用了一匹馬圈地，那匹馬就是從中泥城橋起始圈地的，而非南泥城橋。</p>
<p>提到參議員們建議在跑馬廳建設「文化　」時，吳老光生主張在文化城內最要緊的是應該辦一個「各科職業補習學校」，需日夜上課，而不收學費，各種學術具材設備都應齊備。他說：在英國倫敦一個地方這類學校就有十餘所，名叫「撲立推克立克」（Polytechnic）任何人都可以入學。同時他又談到了當初自己也有這計劃，當民國二年時，吳老先生曾和李石曾·蔡元培等諸先生計劃在跑馬廳旁邊，即現在金門飯店到國際飯店這一段地上建築一個像文化城差不多的三樓大厦，用作舉辦學術硏究塲所。那時國民黨本部曾經把這筆款子籌措成了，可是後來給地產商一搗亂，沒有辦成。說到這裘，老人家抱着草大的希望微笑地說：「如果跑馬廳內文化城眞能辦成，國民黨在民國初年的希望也可以實現了。」</p>
<p>道台灣吳健彰　換文失地皮</p>
<p>據上海名紳趙晋卿談：當時他們趙家的祖墳即在跑馬廳內。那個和英國人換文允許收買地皮的道台叫吳健彰。至於外面傳說有顧維鈞家祖墳在內是不確的。</p>
<p>陳存仁和吳市長談話結果，吳市長亦確認跑馬廳歷史有硏究之必要。但在中英新的中規定，對於英國人已得權利應予尊重，除非是侵佔所得。今據跑馬總會給市長的覆信中說：「市政府對徵收跑馬廳地皮，跑馬總會當隨時可遵行。」道裘，我們對於跑馬總會尊重中國的法令，覺得無限的欽佩。可是問題就在這筆「徵收經費」上面。中國人那裏來這許多錢買這塊「實地一。如果跑馬總會要用現在地價來換買郊外地皮，那末買上一百個同樣大的地皮還有餘吶！所以據陳君的意思：認爲市長祇有根據以往各種値得研究的地方，運用外交方法和跑馬總會父涉收回。陳君所貢獻的意見有數點：</p>
<p>獻收回意見</p>
<p>（一）當時英國人收買跑馬廳地價確乎過低而屬强買。因爲他們在第二個跑馬廳（前水安公司一帶地皮）的時候買得四萬九千四百二十五兩，而同時買進四百三十畝現在的跑馬廳地皮僅化了一萬二千五百兩。可見他們根據洋涇浜章程依照明市買進而以黑市賣出，這似乎太使老百姓吃虧了。在工部局出版柯林所著『上海歷史』中說到一八六三至一八六六年間，華人爲賣地事與英人糾纏達三年之久，跑馬總會深感煩惱。尤其對於跳浜之地三十畝及操塲之地四十一畝料葛最甚。此外，又據參議員黃振世調査，在光緒二十一年，跑馬廳未領購地款之一百二十戶業主曾向總商會（即現在市商會）伸訴（案卷正在査訪巾）。這些都可以證明跑馬總會利用條約，有暴利强購行爲。這是低價收回地權交涉時候的一個良好根據。</p>
<p>（二）前工部局時代上海公園靶子塲本來亦是打靶子運動塲，歸西人打靶總會所有，後經工部局情商改成公國。這『情商』的前例，亦無妨在交涉時採用一下。</p>
<p>（三）請到跑馬總會股份一事，現在已談不上了。這九十幾年來，跑馬總會的產權現在可以確定的發表如次：跑馬總會有一份章程，確是非常公正而嚴密，這種組織在中國團體中簡直沒有。</p>
<p>在一八九六年，跑馬總會選出了三百個『有權』會員，再由其中舉出七名董事委員。『有權』會員如果有缺，即可由「普通」會員申請補任。任「普通」會員要變成「有權」會員，那種嚴格程度比考試還要鄭重。須由二十個審査委員審核。在這二十人中一定要有十三人贊成才可通過，而且如果有任何三人反對，即十三人贊成也作　論。可見在這種嚴密制度之下，不良和不公正份子是不能參加的。</p>
<p>同時，在基本章程第五條中規定：萬一跑馬廳塲地出售，其售得款項不得由三百會員分得，必須作爲另購一新跑馬塲或運動塲之用。地產與私人無涉！興會員及有權會員或董事都無涉！可見徵收土地的價格方面，交涉時大有伸縮餘地！</p>
<p>禁止跑馬可以不必　移往郊區值得贊同</p>
<p>最後，陳君對於第三組審査會審査結果「市中心區不得賽馬」一項表示贊同。因爲跑馬這事在任何國際都市內均有，跑馬不能絕對地說是一種賭博。在上海這大都市內，把跑馬斷然禁止，恐將作爲國際報章上之奇談。可是在市中心區，交通頻繁，人口衆多，需要公園廣塲建設之處允多之時，把這樣大的一塊空地用來跑馬，眞像附着在上海心臟部位的一個巨瘤，那是很說不過去的地方。所以跑馬何必禁止，但也無妨移到郊外舉行。</p>
<p>市參議會代表民意，常然處處爲人民着想，怎樣使人民便利，怎樣爲人民謀福利，這個問題，不過是目前上海急待解決數百種問題中的一個，我們大可不必看得太嚴重。然而，最高民意機構決定了一件事就是「決定」了要去做，這個要不要「做」的大前提也不應該隨隨便便定常的。</p>
<p>又據吳市長昨日在會塲外談：跑馬是否係賭博，我們不必在此爭辯，可以請示中央。至於收回跑馬廳問題，參議會不妨授權與市政府，先與跑馬總會交涉，如交涉不成，再討論應付辦法。跑馬廳地價事實上不能完全按照旁邊不建築土地估計，如果交涉成功，在二年內收回亦有可能性。</p>
<h3>貝志高　昨離滬飛日</h3>
<p>法國駐日本軍事顧問團團長貝志高將軍，已於昨晨九時，乘美軍機離滬飛東京。在滬曾應吳市長國楨之宴，並曾參觀震旦大學，並與在滬之法國要人相見。貝志高將軍對此東方大城市之印象極佳。渠於一九四四年曾任法國駐華大使，在渝有一時期之逗留，巴黎淪陷後，曾赴倫敦參加自由法國政府之組織，追隨戴高樂將軍，稱譽一時。渠本爲蘇聯人，入法籍。貝志高將軍之父，即爲俄國名作家高爾基。</p>

<h3>兩路局大舞弊初審　旁聽席上水洩不通　處長裝傻太太弄權　郁香嚴硬把陳局長一口咬住　商人供詞値得注意　案發後仍要錢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路管理局材料處大舞弊案，由地檢處起訴後，昨在埠院第三法庭開審。因被告達卅六名，乃分上下午審訊。上午十八名全爲路局職員，並由告發本案之兩路局女職員到庭供述經過。下午十八名（其中三人未到）全爲商人。辯護律師多達二十二名，旁聽者滿座，各被告供詞頗　矛盾，案情尚需繼續調查，或有新發展可能。最後庭論十月一日上午再審。</p>
<p>九時卅五分，梅爾和推事偕檢察官及書記官升座後，即傳十八名被告，其中十三名在押，五人交保在外。十八人分三排站立。先由檢察官陳述起訴要旨後，梅推事向十八人一一開始姓名年歲籍貫職務，即命留下王人　·張開源·朱必聞三人先詢，其餘諸人退下。</p>
<p>「處長太太」郁香嚴受詢</p>
<p>先詢首先收佣三人</p>
<p>梅推事問：檢察官起訴書說是你們三人先向各客商收取佣金？三人齊聲答：沒有。事務員王人</p>
<p>稱：共分得二十九萬元，由課長交下，第一次在陰曆年底，給十二萬，未說明來處。朱必聞供：文書課員，由郁香嚴介紹進路局，共分得廿九萬。張開源供：採購課事務員。分得廿九萬，由課長分發，說是年終賞金，未向客商收取佣金，請傳各客商對質。問：四月間處長去杭州時期，由處長太太約你們全體到她家裏商定「三二二三」比例（處長三成，副處長課長二成，小職員共三成）分贓？三人齊搖頭稱：沒有。十時一刻押下。</p>
<p>太太有權代表處長</p>
<p>繼提採購課長張伯康及採購課事務員分送詢價單之經偉均兩人到庭。供稱採購之手續，爲採購課向稽核課領取編就之採購單後，即根據此編造一詢價單，由商人造好報價單，再造比價表，誰家便宜，做一記號，送處長決定。對收取佣金事稱：處長太太對我說過，外面客家送禮，處長說可以收。她在路局雖沒職務，但可代表，我去處長家幾次，有時處長在家，見我說起收取佣金事，即走開。後郁香嚴對我說，處長要到南京去，最初要錢四五百萬，我乃交處長六十萬支票及四十萬現鈔。處長說不要支票，掉好現款一同拿來。處長雖（材料處長張鴻圖）不承認要錢，而係他太太之事，但照情理講，怎會不知。他們夫婦一體。收取方法，並非將物價估高，而由商人在合法利潤中提取一部分送我們。因他們希望公事辦得快，以減少損失。繳處長太太之款一共二千四百萬，分配之款第一次爲二百八十萬，第二次爲八百六十萬，第三次二千八百萬，第四次有二千九百多萬未分，已交警務處。其第一次之經過爲朱必聞張開源兩人來說，處長太太要我們送鋼琴一座，我們沒錢，乃由商人送來二百多萬中，將一百萬送去。以後郁即時常來找我要錢，稱要孝敬上面，是否是指陳伯莊局長則不知。副處長丁厚富處亦送去過六百萬，但是否收受，與該款之下落則不知。北站曾一度發現傳單，攻擊郁香嚴，上畫一大烏龜，寫你要做生意，拿錢來。同時亦攻擊張處長，收受商人之款。我不知是違法行爲，因郁做過律師云。供畢庭論還押。</p>
<p>輪　郁香嚴</p>
<p>庭論帶郁香嚴。旁聽席上一陣騷動，郁隨法警到庭，郁供：三十一歲，嘉善人，大夏大學畢業，業律師二年，於日軍入租界時停業。曾任中央組織部總幹事。嫁張鴻圖已十年。並稱曾從事投機生意，夫婦經濟獨立。推事突然拔巧地問：「聽說你有　嗜好？」郁否認。又問與張伯康張雲鶴的關係？答：「張伯康出於丈夫介紹而認識，張雲鶴是我做小姐時認識。」她又供稱「張雲鶴稱我夫去杭時，常來我家鬼鬼祟祟。」言時面赤。問：「你指揮收賄，要鋼琴，你可知犯法？」答：「法律以眞實爲根據，我局外人有何資格指揮行賄，亦從未要過鋼琴。」又稱：「此案起因，爲陳伯莊局長有計畫打擊張鴻圖，案未發前，陳局長曾托人示意張鴻圖辭職，其後則發現　寶，攻擊材料處」。「案發之後沈士擊處去過否？」答「沒有」。又供：「材料處曾賄陳伯莊五百萬元，由張伯康與業兩人連問桔子香烟送往，彼事前未知底細。張伯康爲陳親信，今張之辯護律師，即由陳代請」問案至此，郁之辯護律師要求庭上傳詢陳伯莊。庭上尤爲考慮。最後郁供：案發後曾至陳局長家三次，第一次陳局長電話約往，表示由伊（郁）出面，可以減輕張鴻圖罪名。第二次約「吃紅茶」處會面（張伯康家），因當時記不起何處，故未往。第三次於晚八時半，陳伯莊曾表示良心懺悔，即於是夜被押。</p>
<p>張處長一切不知？</p>
<p>繼詢材料處長張鴻圖，對張伯康所稱各點皆否認。稱：這舞弊我完全不知道，我太太想亦未參與。本人自知採購材料，易爲人猜疑，故曾揚議組織材料採購委員會，由各處長參加，共同負責，但未爲局長批准。本人　業大學，留學國外，抗戰時在內地工作，勝利後想做點實業。本案事前不知，發生後，他們亦未向我報告收多少佣金，如知定予撤差，我所知衹是行政上之事，舞弊之事不知。問畢押下。</p>
<p>都道是節賞</p>
<p>繼詢課員陳景曜稱：供分得八十九萬元，由課長交下。司事顧振民稱：分得八十九萬，課長說是年終節賞詢購料股主任課員張澤隆稱：共分得一百廿二萬。司事朱培宗稱：分得八十九萬，課員夏定武稱：分得七十五萬。司事孫學三稱：分得廿萬。課員徐傅貴稱：分得三十萬。分時皆稱是節賞。另交保在外之收發李潔稱：共分得七十七萬。課員蔡志道稱：分得七十萬。課員俞培恩稱：分得七十五萬。課員何祖恩稱：分得六十萬。皆稱於陰曆年底，陽曆年底及端午節三次發放，稱係節賞，由經偉鈞陳景曜轉交。不知爲贓款。現皆已交還路局警務處。</p>
<p>不願同流合污</p>
<p>繼傳兩證人亦即告發人黃汝珍及沈珪璋，皆該局女職員。黃稱：担任事務員，第一次經偉鈞交我二十萬，因無緣無故，不受，經乃稱上面交下不必客氣。正懷疑旁的課爲何都沒有，後又與親戚談起，知爲佣金，乃思應　公家，不應該拿，故寫信附人，直接報告局長，其他之事不詳。沈稱：陳景曜交我十萬元，問來源，稱是獎勤金，正感懷疑，第二次卅萬又交我，並稱材料處名譽不好聽，不要向外面人講，方知一切，乃寫信將錢附入告之局長，旁事不知。</p>
<p>詢畢，庭論帶各人入庭簽字。郁香嚴於簽字前向書記官索開口供筆錄，並要求添入：「第二次約「吃紅茶」處未去，故續約至陳局長家（百利南路）」兩句。並陳述張雲鶴與彼有仇誣告，張伯康與張鴻圖意見不合，張鴻圖曾要求調張伯康因而結冤。並特別強調張伯康之律師由陳伯莊代聘一點，喋喋不休，歷時三十分鐘之久。郁簽字畢，即宣告退庭。時已下午一時半。</p>
<h3>下午訊問經協理十五天　大都承認經偉鈞來要錢</h3>
<p>下午二時十分續訊交保在外之商人十八名。除三名未到外，候詢之十五人爲勝昌五金號經理於仲潞，和源五金號協理金雲亭，益和五金號協理李汾賓，久昌興五金號經理吳蓮慶，恒豐五金號經理石耀庭，大成五金號經理楊文禮，惠新西服號經理沈連生，源利鐵號經理周錦華，祥興紗頭號經理徐炳洪，大興昌五金號經理俞毅夫，利源五金號經理李行信，鑫記電料行經理王雲仙，泰來五金號經理沈會卿，益新印刷紙號經理忻鼎甫。另復提負責收取佣金之採購課事務員經偉鈞到庭對質。</p>
<p>訊問結果，其中除久昌，利源，鑫記，泰來，益新等數家供稱，絕未交付分文，並由經偉鈞證實外，餘均承認由經拿去數萬元至數百萬元不等，唯供矢口否認有太高貨價，供給佣金等情事。其中以勝昌五金號給與經者爲最多，達三百十一萬。最少者爲恒豐五金號，僅端午節時，「借」去二三萬元。其事之最可怪者，爲據大成·惠新·大興昌等三家供稱：案發後路局警務處審押同經偉鈞前來借錢，彼口稱「幫幫忙」，遂又彼借去十餘萬至數十萬元。</p>
<p>有送即受</p>
<p>詰之經偉鈞稱：共有一百多家商號，不能記清。他們自願送的錢，不送的亦不一定要。借的都是幾家熟的。並非抬高價格，大多由他們自己來辦公處交給我，我是奉課長之命收的，而課長又奉處長太太之命收的。逢節頭上，幾家老客家都送，新的如自願送來，亦不拒絕，並不知是犯法。至向人借錢，因聽說處長課長等要辭職，在路局每月衹近十萬元薪水，家中十餘口，不夠開銷，乃擬借錢，以另謀生路云。審訊至三時五十分完畢，庭論還需繼續調查，待十月一日上午再審，經偉鈞還押，各商人仍交原保。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國立幼稚敎育專科學校，自江西遷滬，首次招生工作，業已全部完竣，計錄取新生四十名。記者昨訪該校校長陳鶴琴氏，承發表談話如次：現在中國敎育進步的緩慢，其最大的原因，就在敎育態度的改變不够，多少年來敎員祇知道捧住書本敎，學生就只能跟着書本讀死書。其實，整個天地巾，偌大的自然，社會環境，何處不是敎材，何處不好敎學。所以，我在江西時提倡活敎育，就是覺得中國的敎育，現在必須澈底加以改革了。譬如同樣上一課肥皂的製法，從書本上得到的，就遠不及讓兒童自己跑到皂廠去參觀製造方法所得的知識來得豐富，印象來得深刻，所以活敎育的收效，一定是事半功倍的。活敎育是沒有敎室，不用課本的敎學方法，到處都可以作敎室，任何事物都可以作敎材。它的口號是：「做，學，敎合一」這裏尤其注意做字，因爲隨便什麽事情，經過一做，就容易懂，容易記憶。活敎育有五大體系，它包括：三大目標，四個步驟，五個活動，十個對比，十二個原則。它的敎學步驟和比利時名敎育家德可樂利的敎育主張相吻合，就是第一，觀察，實騐，第二，閱讀，參考，第三，寫作，發表，第四，檢討，考核。這樣一來，孩子們的知識就不是從死的書本上去求得，而是先經過他們自己的觀察，然後去找書閱讀，再發表他們對這一事物的意見，最後是集體的討論。這樣所得到的印象是非常深刻的，而這種知識，才是最寶貴的，眞正的知識。最後陳氏嘻嘻的吿訴記者：「在上海市立幼稚師範學校的各部，預備從本學期起，即開始推行活敎育，至於成績如何，那還得看大家的努力，和社會人士的注意，以及善意的批評援助，來作結論。」陳氏肯定地說：「活敎育一定會有它光輝　爛的前途，這是可以相信的，我們也有着這樣堅定的信心，因爲它是跟着整個中國的社會形態而發展的產物。」</p>

<h3>經濟部王部長談　當前之經濟措施　管理紗布南運或將兼銷南洋　配銷紗照舊工貸可予以協助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部部長王雲五氏，昨日中午應第六區機器紡織業同業公會之邀，出席餐宴。同席者尚有王曉籟，束雲章，李升伯，劉文騰，王啓宇，榮鴻元等，多人，餐後曾就當前紗市配銷及南運諸問題，交換意見，迄三時半，始告散席。</p>
<p>會後王部長循各報記者之請，解答所提問題多則，茲擇要分諸如次：（一）棉紗布輸往華南暫行管理辦法，業經行政院及經濟部核准。其中對紗布輸往華南數額之規定，原則上將參考民國廿五年及廿六年紗布運往華南之數額，再衡以現時紗布之生產量，較彼時生產量減少之程度，然後酌定紗布之合理輸出額。（記者按：據紡織界若干檉威估計：民國廿五六年時，以輸往廣州，山頭，廈門，福州四口岸而言，紗每月平均約爲八百件，布每月平均約爲十一萬六千疋。又生產力量方面，民國廿五六年各廠紗錠之運轉數，約爲五百萬錠，現時已減爲二百五十萬錠，實際生產量，約減縮一半。）（二）華南本爲國土之一部，設非轉口走私關係，紗布南銷，例應不成問題。今後紗布南銷，將調查當地實際需要情形而加輸出。同時，在維持紗價不漲之前提下，或將考慮出口南洋各屬。此舉不但可將棉紗供應南洋各地華僑廠商之急需，且可爲國家取得外匯。（三）將來紗布南銷將由紡織事業管理委員會負責審核之責。核准南銷之紗布，將通知海關放行。（四）棉紗籍香港走私問題，經與香港政府洽商後，已承協助制止。至澳門轉口走私案，刻正設法解決中。（五）第二次國民營各廠聯合配銷棉紗數額，仍定三萬件。至各項配售辦法，與前略同。（六）收購新棉及貸款辦法，正考慮中。擬由紡織事業管理委員會，與第六區紗廠公會等，共商集體收購辦法。國家對民生有關工業之貸款，如有必要，必予協助。（七）工商督導處，可望於下月正式成立。該處之組織法，業已通過。組織簡單，目的單純。以輔導民營工礦事業，及國際貿易爲職旨。（八）經部企業司，現已撤銷，改設國際貿易司。（九）經部蘇浙皖特派員辦公處將儘可能於九月底結束。屆時尚有未了事宜之各部門，將另設處結束。（十）日本人造絲，即將有大批運到，因係中央信託局辦理，對日易貨而輸入，故將由中信局決定配銷辦法。</p>
<h3>美鈔漲勢愈烈　市場謠諑繁興　金價跟漲二萬四</h3>
<p>烚赤昨上場尚平，近午始轉堅俏，仍受美鈔所支配，晨開二一四萬七有售，壓力少施，隔夜浮多亦售，不久曾見二一三萬五左右而後稍穩，微有回升，十時後央行配給一〇〇條，價亦隨市升爲二一四萬七五，此後平穩逾恒，在二一五萬左右徘徊甚久，無如美鈔愈喊愈高，近午竟隨美鈔同漲至二一七萬外，午刻略回，在二一六萬五左右掙扎，午後更感興奮，曾漲至二一八萬以上，而後稍回，結果較前收好起二萬四，飾金掛高至廿三萬二，紋銀銀元平穩，暗拆息價因銀根鬆而退至一角三以下。</p>
<p>外幣籌碼極涸，經不起大量收買，初疲後俏，近午復至軋空爭買情形，最開三四四〇元有售，開後曾降至三四〇〇元，始得支持，十時後買戶見殷，在三四五〇元左右，一度呈拉鋸情狀，近午漲勢大盛，買氣彌漫，漲至三六五〇元以上，午後更爲激昂，結款大盛，謠諑應運而生，復呈軋空及爭買情形，飛漲至七七〇元而後略平，結果較前收猛騰二六〇元，對黃金之比價軋攏至五八六元半對十兩，港票亦被動帶高達三十七元之多。</p>
<p>公債上落甚微</p>
<p>公債求供有限，過程盤旋，統丙最開二〇〇〇元，中途退至一八九〇元而後略回，曾扳高至二〇三〇元而後稍定，臨收在一九六〇元至一九九〇元之間徘徊，結果較前收微挫二十元，餘者榮辱均微。</p>
<h3>外股高後轉盤</h3>
<p>外股昨轉徘徊，熱股高後轉盤，怡紗自九三〇〇元，英聯一一七〇〇元起，熱股盤至低價結束，結果較前收計會德豐航業鋼業微升，英聯紙業微挫，餘者平平，冷股已有成交，一般游資傾向搜羅冷股。</p>
<h3>棉紗黑市　貨從配售來　限價加貼費</h3>
<p>〔大通社訊〕本市棉紗號同業，對於紡建表示，此乃經濟部方面意見，故棉紗號同業最近將推派代表向經濟部請願，現在紗業市場，照常交易，所有棉紗，均由獲得配貨廠商手中流出之貨物作交易，其價格悉依照黑市。聞最近頗多民營紗廠銷售貨品，亦均不遵限價，俱用巧妙方式牟利，即爲一三〇萬元一件棉紗，客戶所付支票與賬面，委依限價，另具二十萬元現鈔，作額外價款，並不入賬，即被查究，亦無痕跡，諸如此類情形，詢諸紗號同業，亦云已成公開之秘密矣云。</p>
<h3>米價堅俏</h3>
<p>米市昨以天未放晴，兼之京蕪產區報昂人心趨堅，南北市趨勢均形蓬勃，粳秈米上升二三千元，白元亦止跌轉漲，社會局繼續拋售巴西米四四〇包，客貨登記，總達八千餘石，麵粉零化仍殷，續漲三四百元，麩皮高而愈固，續見高翔，再升二三百元，蠶豆亦盤漲千元，黃豆汕頭及本市油　均揀巧拾取，高貨尚覺挺站，略見上升三四百元，惟中次則因來貨尚多，受主仍稀，依然平正，綠豆近因漢口來源獨多，去化南洋不動，本街亦淡，猛跌七八百元，苞米連日狂落之後，疲而轉定，生仁到不敵消，沸騰四五千元，油市到消兩平，店方納胃動而不旺，形趨平正，暫乏軒輊，小麥興化泉州略有去化，市面堅穩。</p>
<h3>木材　到貨不斷　銷路呆滯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美菲及浙閩等處之木料，源源不絕來滬，價雖未見低落，銷路呆滯，存貨擁塞，據聞福州待運之木料不下十餘萬噸，以林森，舟山兩輪載運，須一年始可運畢，昨日林森輪自福州返滬，計裝木料一千七百餘噸，挪商順亭洋行經理之蘇梅凡兩號，自美卜往閩特埠，運來木料二十五萬餘呎，約下星期二到埠。</p>
<h3>市況先熱後冷　華股交易平庸</h3>
<p>華股昨以報載財部解釋對於銀錢業透支額並不限制，亦不必保證等訊，人心見俏，上場時又見高昂，場內買氣轉盛，檯面幫乘機哄抬，各熱門續告向榮，半小時後漸露疲態，多方再告恐慌，逐步盤低，十一時後浮多及檯面幫復告不支，紛求脫手，情勢忽疲，但逢低稍有補空，微有曲折，午刻在低價掙扎，僅新光較爲活潑，尚形小秀，餘者都難振作，結果較前收計永紗景福平平，美亞勤興微跌，新光稍漲，較冷各股計絲業升半成，統益華豐平平，中紡大通新亞景綸各跌半成光景，餘者雖挫而不多，場外各股亦再微落。</p>
<p>綜觀昨日市場情況，先熱後冷，成交總量不足六百萬股，各票行市先漲後落，惟漲落之幅度甚小，各熱股行市最高最低之差度僅在百分之二左右，市場空氣極爲和平，無大波動。</p>
<h3>義大利定貨上市　人造絲續跌</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲市繼續回跌，一二〇號天橋有光，上午三百二十萬元收盤，下午續挫三萬元，較上日下午短八萬元，雜牌有光短六七萬元，半光小四五萬元，黑市場中氣燄稍殺，已無前二日之威風，因義絲第一批定貨已上市，洋行繼續接受定單，價與現市距離甚遠，故買戶皆存觀望，廠絲七十八分D字等級成交價比上日做小五萬元，中級及普通貨因廠銷活躍，皆提高五萬至十萬元，于經價站原盤，綢貨被而又見高，大　呢銷路不惡，比前日大四五百元，餘俱堅穩，杭貨因工人正在發生提高工資之要求，恐須看好。</p>
<h3>雙馬標準　二次配紗時將取消　採購國棉應任自由　紡織業理事長王啟宇之談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據第六區機器紡織業同業公會理事長王啟宇語本報記者稱：自國民營各紗廠決定辦理第二次集團配紗三萬件後，第六區紗廠公會所屬會員二十九單位，將於今日下午二時，集會商討配售棉紗事宜。聞第二次集團開紗時，將取消以雙馬牌紗爲標準之規定。凡符合於四百磅二十支棉紗之標準者，即可按開售價格配售。又昨日廿支紗市價棧單，每件爲一百四十六萬元。到期棧單，每件爲一百五十二萬元。與前數次配售價，相去過甚。故今次配售價，乃略予調整。關於集團採購新棉事宜。渠認爲依過去經驗言，未盡滿意。蓋各廠生產情形不同，用棉各有多寡。按經濟原理言，反不如採取自由競爭之爲佳。渠稱：民國廿五六年時，我國原棉產量，年達一千六百萬担。而全國每年消耗量，僅一千二百萬担。故尚有餘額，可供外銷。設交通恢復，原棉生產納入正軌，則我國原棉之供應，理應不成問題。至目前各紗廠生產量減少之主因，不出二點：一，供電量減少。二，工人工作時間縮短云。</p>
<h3>配紗漲五萬　本銷客銷皆發動　華南又有購進津幫最健　龍頭七萬五千無貨應市</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗廠聯合配銷委員會於昨日下午三時，循例集會當議決開售二十支棉紗標準數額計民營一、〇五四、五件，照申請額全配。紡建配出二、二四五件，仍爲按照紡建所定配紗標準，酌量配售。售價以四百磅二十支雙馬爲標準，每件爲一百三十五萬元，較上次配售價，已提高五萬元。下次開售日期已定於九月廿三日。</p>
<p>市上做開紗價　見澎湃，津幫納胃仍健，長江路去化亦暢，是以開盤即漲五七萬，紅魁彩魁天女雙喜，均爲津幫採辦之對象，大飛艇尤爲江西客所必需，是以上述各牌獨俏，沉寂已久之華南，昨日亦有購進，且本埠建築廠，因銷數加旺，競進原料，走勢挺秀，價皆上漲，紡建圓盤開出，更添開期貨以資調劑，但藍鳳豐年，已不若前兩日之鋒俏，收市價較上日所漲有限，特雙馬曾一度衝出一百六十萬關，旋以一百五十七萬收盤，亦較上日升五萬。</p>
<p>布市昨上升不已，龍頭喊價七萬五千元，尚無貨應市，高檔如豐鶴神鷹皆扒吸一空，本市染廠搜羅最多，此種交易，皆屬實銷，染廠如華豐之美亭，大陸之大鹿，一九〇絲光士林，有價即售罄，存底缺少，採購又旺，致造成此種現象。</p>
<h3>以煤易電辦法　期限延長三月</h3>
<p>經濟部前爲便利工廠用電，特訂定以煤易電辦法，實行以來，收效不少，該項辦法八月底即告滿期，茲特展期至十一月底，凡工廠需要電力若干，可逕向燃料管理委員會登記申請購煤，一經該會核准，即可獲得所需要之用電量云。</p>
<h3>市場尅期飭查　麵粉產銷數量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：糧食部頃以天津市批發糧商業同業公會呈請：要求將禁止麵粉出口令取消，俾南粉得以北運，以維民食。糧部當令市府，查明滬市麵粉產銷確實數量各若干，每日是否過剩，及過剩若干。刻請項訓令，已由市府社會局轉飭第四區麵粉工業同業公會於三日內查獲，以便轉部核辦云。</p>
<h3>澳洲羊毛　已運到五十萬鎊</h3>
<p>澳洲羊毛前受政府統制，紡六十支以上之上等毛，及五十支以上之中等毛，英紡織業須自用，對外輸出遭受限制。目前裝運來華者，大多爲五十支以下之下等毛，該項貨品，英紡織界已不甚需要，故能對外銷售，頃悉：英商船塞姆傑克輪Sam　jack裝有紡四十支及四十四支混合羊毛約五十萬磅，於十九日到埠，今日即可卸貨。</p>
<h3>花呢銷路大暢</h3>
<p>細毛光質花呢，毋論條子，格子，人字，板四等，近來市銷頗暢，標準行情每碼又好起一二千元不等，老裝全毛貨及來路貨等趨勢更俏。</p>
<h3>麗來增設　第三廠</h3>
<p>麗來化學工業廠，設立於民國二十八年，聘有藥劑化學專家多人專事研製各種化妝日用物品，出品頗爲優良。現有製造廠兩所，因供不應求，現已購地三十畝，建造第三廠。正在加案計劃中</p>

<h3>技工請發差額基金　要求加入市府合作社</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我是工務局附屬機構的技工，我們每月工資，連米貸金在內，總共的八萬元左右，區區之數，實難維持高昂生活，茲有下列二點，請主管當局注意改善。</p>
<p>（一）過去技工的基木數，佔職員百分之八十，自六月份調整公務員待遇實施後，反減至百分之六十，經局長商奉　市座面准自六月份起增至百分之七十，而我們領到的，仍以百分之六十計算，請當局將六。七月份基本數差額一萬四千元，從速補發。再本月報載國防會通過調整公務員待遇案，警察·工役亦按新標準予以提高，並決定於八月份起實施等，但是調整待遇的訓令，還遲遲未下，本月米貸金又暫不發給，所以本月工資僅得六萬左右，希望當局在這次調整時，至少應恢復原有百分之八十的基本數及底薪的加成數，並儘速發放。</p>
<p>（二）市府員工消費合作社，因爲不容加入，致平價配給物無法購買，不知員工合作目的何在？再新成立的公敎人員配給處，警察及衛生局的垃圾工都忙着登記。何獨工務局偏重職員，置工人於不顧？希主管福利長官，從速辦理加入合作社及公敎人員配給處登記事宜。</p>
<p>目下道路破損，溝渠淤塞，雖因路料缺乏，然當局漢視工人生活，以致工作效率低落，亦爲主因之一，若能實施以上兩點，並隨時顧及工人福利，對於工作效率，不無小補也·（劉順華）八·二八·</p>

<h3>社會服務　答復讀者</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）拒行婚禮</p>
<p>王榮森問　余自幼即由父母之命，媒妁之言，與一女子訂立婚約。現已成人父母迫令尅日成婚。雖一再反對，仍屬無效。不得已斷然出走，後經鄰舍勸吿回家，那知父母已把那女子領在家中。父母也不提起這婚姻，對方的父母還以爲女兒已經結婚，蒙鼓裏。這許多日子中，我也沒有理過她一次，今有問題四個，請先生答覆：（一）是項婚的在法律上是否有效？（二）如登報否認婚的有效否？（三）如解除此項婚的，現在應與對方進行什麽法律手繼？（四）如果一旦與另一女子結婚，有無意外間題？</p>
<p>〔傳况麟律師答〕（一）果如來函所述，在法律上爲無效，（二）爲顧全對方體面起見，可不必登報；（三）用書信或面治，向對方表示解除婚的之原因，對方如無過失，幷應向其給付相當之損害賠償金，此項損害，不限於財產上之損害；（四）此時另與他人訂婚，在法律上雖不受前項婚的之拘束，但仍以將前項婚的解除後，再另行訂婚爲妥善。</p>
<p>（二）因病解約</p>
<p>陳浩銘問　敝友恂慧女士，十七歲時（民二九）由父母之命與馮某訂婚。今馮某因勤學積勞而患肺病，久不見痊，女士爲終身幸福計，曾由父母出而與對方談判，謀解除婚約，對方藉詞拖延，年餘尙未能了結。倘依據法律，未悉常循何途徑解決爲妥善。</p>
<p>〔傳况麟律師答〕査民法第九百七十五條載，婚的不得請求强迫履行云云，又同法第九百七十六條第一項第四款，有婚的當事人之一方，有重大不治之病者，他方得解除婚的之規定。對方旣久病不愈，可用書信向其表示解除之決意，同時即不受此項婚的之拘束，但對方如請求返還訂婚之聘金時，須返還之。</p>
<p>（三）擅佔房屋</p>
<p>段瑞英問　（一）外子之姊，在民國十三年以前出嫁，（頒佈　承法之前），是否絕對無繼承遺產之權利？（二）自從外子之父亡後，（已廿二年）房產呈報，竹係外子（獨生子）出名，今外子服務外地，其姊如未得同意，擅自搬入，佔屋居住，是否觸犯刑律？能否呈請法院制止之？</p>
<p>〔傅况麟律師答〕（一）令翁死亡之期，如在民國十五年十月以前，則尊夫之姊，即無遺產繼承權。（二）尊夫之姊，擅自佔據房屋，究屬於法不合，惟與尊夫有血親關係，應動以感情，而爲和平之解決，否則自可訴之法庭。</p>

<h3>上海市參議會第一屆第一次大會</h3>
<p>— 凡士</p>
<p>從九月九日開始，兩週以來，非但爲全上海市民所關切，亦爲全中國甚至全世界人士所注目。</p>
<p>用世界的眼光來看參議會，當民主政治在歐美已如家常便飯一樣普遍熟習的時候，中國還剛剛在開始草創，我們於慚愧警惕之餘，對於新生的嬰兒因此彌覺珍貴。從歷史的觀點來看參議會，中國經過幾千年帝王專制思想的傳襲，到今天終於嗅到了人民世紀的氣息，民意機構第一次正式表達了人民的意志。這是一個新的紀元的開始，我們呼吸到新時代的芬氣息，尤感到無限的與奮與鼓舞！</p>
<p>兩星期來參議會的工作表現，誠如某外報所批評，遠在一般人預料之上。我們看到會塲中熱烈緊張的情緒和認眞率真的態度。我們更看到參議員批判政府機關指責行政幣實時的毫無顧忌，暢所欲言。我們也看到有關民生疾苦的種種問題這被坦白提出，深切研討，凡此種種，都表示出一股良好的精神，一個健全的開端。我們不必一定希望這一次的參議會能得出怎樣顯著的結果來，就僅僅這一種精神，已足夠代表它的意義而指示出中國民主前途燦爛的遠景來了。</p>

<h3>斯爲美</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>在人生數十寒暑的旅途上，痛苦和快樂時屬相對性的。正如同盛夏烈日的耀武揚威，使人憎惡，和冬季溫暖陽光，普照大地之被人珍愛；沒有經過凜冽的嚴冬，不能領略到春光明媚，惠風和煦的可貴。</p>
<p>藝術的欣賞和創造，是指導人生，踏進另一理想的境界；化凶暴爲和諧，化殘酷爲仁愛，化鬥爭爲和平；追求真理，不爲物欲所蔽，『丹青不知老將至，富貴於我如浮雲』，這種超功利的思想，是代表東方哲學的精萃。</p>
<p>藝人整個的生命史，正如一葉孤舟，航行大海，遇着奔騰澎湃的狂瀾，朔風凜冽，砭人肌骨，踽踽獨行的寒夜，憑他個人金剛的信念，百折不撓的精神，不顧當前黑暗險惡的客觀環境，他要創造和追求未來的光明。米格朗智羅Michelangelo在一五〇一年形成大衛David石像，沉雄渾厚的作風，是古希臘以來，僅有的偉蹟；當時却幾乎被佛羅稜斯居民所擊毀。十九世紀大作家羅丹A．Rodin，他的傑作『思想者』，『銅器時代』，和『布爾札古像』，受人攻訐和非難，因此促成他創造不朽的傑構『加萊義民羣像』，及『地獄門羣像』，這都是歷史的先例。不但藝人如此，科學家，宗教家，教育家和政治家的成就，殺身成仁，捨生取義的大智大勇的表現，并不淵源於道德的範疇，乃是發揮人性至善的崇高美感。孔子爲什麽周遊列國，席不暇暖；北印度迦昆羅城，凈飯王子釋迦氏，經過六年的雪山修行，而創造出悲天憫人的佛教；武訓是一個山東堂邑縣的乞兒，他有什麽豐富的學識，卓越的天才，居然在中國教育史上，別具風格；解放黑奴，激起南北美戰爭的林肯總統，想不到在一八六五年，遭人暗殺，孫中山先生爲什麽四十年來，不避艱險，創造出一部中華民族的奮鬥革命史？</p>
<p>功利主義者，坐井觀天的狹隘人生觀，燬滅人性，造成人類黑暗悲慘殘酷的血淚史，人們早就看厭了。在實際人生舞台上，繼續不斷，再接再厲的扮演貪婪，險詐，凶殘，鬥爭的醜劇，讓我們換換胃口罷，來呼吸呼吸清新馥郁的和平空氣！不然等到『人爲萬物之靈』的寶座　台，就要墜入『人爲萬物之靈』的萬丈黑暗深淵。</p>
<h3>石濤年齡籍貫考</h3>
<p>— 梁烈亞</p>
<p>我是最喜愛賞識我鄉先賢石濤的書畫的，得讀本欄溫髪桐先生的「石濤和尚」以後，又引我研究石濤的興趣來了。因此，我對於石濤的籍貫年齡的見解，與溫先生所說的有些少不同之處；願意和有興趣研究石濤人們討論一下。</p>
<p>溫先生根據張浦山「畫徵續錄」、「揚州畫苑」和秦祖永「桐陰諭畫」曾經這樣說「石濤和尚究竟是怎樣的一個人物？從上述讀書之中，我們可以發現簡單的「前明楚藩之後」與「勝國楚藩之後」的記錄」。</p>
<p>不錯，這個記錄是有根據的，但我認這個根據有些靠不住，因爲「揚州畫苑」和「桐陰諭畫」都是根據張浦山「畫徵續錄」來的，而張浦山對於石濤本來不甚相識，他作完了「畫徵錄」以後，到揚州看見揚州八怪時常效仿石濤的畫，他才把石濤傳在「續錄」裏面，但是，他仍然不能確實的認識石濤。</p>
<p>我們不必間接去搜尋別的著作用來發現石頭是怎樣的一個人？很方便的可以將石濤所畫　畫來直接參考一下，便可以得到很確實的答案了，石濤不是曾經用過「靖江後裔」和「贊之十世孫阿長」兩個印章嗎？這，就是石濤自己說明他是「靖江後裔」是「靖江王守謙之子贊儀十世之孫」，不是「楚藩之後」了。</p>
<p>靖江王的藩府，建築在廣西省桂林城內的獨秀峰下，所以石濤畫畫的落款嘗自稱「粵山僧原濟」和「粵西石濤濟」，此外，他還有一印曰「粵山」，這些證據，又是石濤自己說明他是粵西人，再有到過黔滇兩粵等地的江陰陳鼎，他在他所著的「雷溪外集」裏面亦說石濤是廣西人，華亭張祥河於滿清道光二十五年到廣西做藩司的時候，著了一本「粵西筆述」亦附有石濤傳在裏面，至於溫先生說石濤「也就是明室的後裔」，也是很對的，但溫先生不能明確的指定石濤不是「楚藩之後」和說「石濤是廣西人」而已。</p>
<p>溫先生對於石濤的年齡這樣說：「他的生卒年月雖然一時不能考定，但從他的「辛末冬日雪中，張汝作先生見招才人傑士，擁座一時，公來日有都門之行，賦謝兼贈」的一詩首句「半生南北老風牕」看，那年是崇禎四年（一六三一）他應三四十歲的人」，但是在我們看見故宮博物院藏的石濤和王原祁合作的蘭竹，是在滿清康熙三十年（辛末）所作的，如果照溫先生的考據來作證，那末，石濤到了康熙辛末，應該是一百歲了，還有王原祁是生於崇禎十五年的，倘若那個辛末的年份是崇禎的，則原祁尚未出世焉能同石濤合作呢？況且石濤亦未有壽到九十一或一百歲的證據。</p>
<p>溫先生又說石濤在「壬午春三月大滌堂下北　海棠妖豔，戲寫並放佛　　遺意」的壬午亦認爲崇禎十五年的壬午，但我們根據石濤自題畫梅長跋云「予自庚申獨得一枝，六載遠近，不復他出」的文字來考證，石濤在崇禎十五年時候才十三四歲尚住賡西，那裏得一枝閣「揚州」呢？</p>
<p>石濤的年齡本來不易尋考，但根據他請八大替他畫大滌堂圖的手扎裏面說：「人聞先生年逾七十，而登山如飛，真神仙中人，濟方六十四五，諸事不堪，見往來者新得書畫，皆非濟可能讚頌得之寶物也，今日李松庵還南州，空函寄上，濟欲求先生堂畫一軸，平坡上老屋數櫞，閣中空諸所有，即大滌堂也？」就知道石濤自己自說他的年齡了，可是這一剳手札沒有記出年份來，幸有後來石濤在八大所畫給他之大滌堂圖詩跋裏面，寫明「時戊寅夏五月清湘陳人大滌濟山僧草」，依此年份推測，便是康熙三十七年「戊寅」八大年紀七十四，石濤六十八九左右，即可證明石濤在崇禎三年，祗是二三歲的小孩子，不能說他是三四十歲的人。</p>
<p>石濤遺下來的畫片，寫明年月的不甚多見，我們根據他題有年月的以測他的年齡到什麽年爲止，用來推定他的壽數若十年，計至康熙四十六丁亥（一七〇六）爲最末次的年份，大約石濤就在這年圓寂，壽數在七十八歲左右。</p>
<h3>王英保先生山水畫引</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>畫畫之道，與世運升降。近二三十年，塗抹獷悍之風，既臻其極，　已就裝；而國家處茲貞元之會，興復大業，雲蒸霞起，則藝苑宗風趨於精微鉅麗，勢有必然。故今之畫畫家，凡不爲茍　者，不惟提挈風氣之光，其志事精力，皆可尚也。余幼時隨宦舊京，家中頗蓄　器畫畫，性好之，顧才不堪學，獨羡余同學王英係精研六法，天資超穎，落筆秀逸，烟雲溪瀑，着紙若有濕氣；其畫山細　，意近王葳；而渲染研妙，乃往往使人憶趙仲穆文徵明之境；信乎俊流也。繼而英保遊學美洲，策勛九府，才望　　，爲時流重，顯於丹青夙好，猶復鍥而不捨，今將出其所作，以　滬演人士，亦可以觀其所養矣。噫！英保與余別將十載，搜余敝　，其零　存褚，或有存者，較今昔之精能，以證余升降之說，願與耆人士共揚榷焉。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　39</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「走？」他好像證實了我在暗示他離開長辛店，「叫我走到那兒去？頭一個，盤川沒有着落；家鄉雖有些祖產，早叫我　切八大塊，一塊一塊都變成了銀子，貼補了幾年的家用。上北平</p>
<p>？沒有路。倒是定縣還有半個朋友在那裏辦模範村，您可準知道我能在那弄份差事？沒有差事，我這一家七八口，還能癟着肚子活下去？」</p>
<p>他說七八口，大約是把預算案裏的第四位千金「菊君，」也算在裏面了。</p>
<p>「鼎元兄，」我沉思了一下，鄭重其事的說，「辦法我可以想，或走或不走，可是主意得您自己拿；待在這裏，雖有辦法，可不能保安全。……」</p>
<p>「那麼，您認爲這個仗準打得起來？」他迫不及待，把問題改了。</p>
<p>「從蔣委員長的宣言看，有五成和平，五成應戰，換句話，要是日人不顧一切，蠻幹下去，我們連最低的和平條件都弄不到手，那只有自衛了。從日人的夢想看，十成有十成是戰。再說安全的話，當然要走，還要走得遠遠的，定縣離開這裏，不過幾個小時的火車，走，等於不走……我看要十分安全的話，恐怕只有四個地方：湖南·貴州·雲南·四川·……江西·安徽·廣西·不敢擔保。」</p>
<p>「何致開到這個大範圍……？」工程師聽了我的話，眼睛都嚇得圓了，可又不敢深信。「這話有根據嗎？」</p>
<p>「老兄——，」我索性給他一個痛快，「叨在知己，我把真話告訴您罷。我這話是十分有根據的。別的不說，只看「田中奏則，」日本早在那裏準備獨　東亞。最近根據日本參謀本部的作戰計劃，準備在中國，一共有幾個大會師——一枝兵走京綏經大同到太原下洛陽，一枝沿着平　綫過保定南下，會師鄭州；再又分兵橫跨　海，與津浦南下的兵，會師徐州；又是會師武漢，再又沿長江東下，和上海登陸的大軍會師南京。要是我們政府即時南進的話，恐怕還要來一個會師韶關。……您也不能說日人完全在夢想，我就記得有一個德國軍事家說過，只須五百德國正規軍，就可蹂躪全中國。所以日人期望在很短的一個時期內，就可解決整個中國。」</p>
<p>「噢，……這麼說，這是整個國家存亡問題了，」他觸動了國家觀念了。「走？那不是辦法……最多祗能讓孩子們……婦女們……奇怪，宋哲元又是個什麽主見呢？」他低下頭，似乎在自己同自己商量。</p>
<p>我們的談話，到此告一段落。從他的言語中，可以發見他的錯誤。大約他認爲七七事變，僅僅是個局部問題。當時除了少數頭腦清楚的軍政人物外，大概全是這位工程師一致想法。</p>
<p>一連幾天，我忙着工作，靜候鶴兄的消息，也無心問到工程師鼎元的事。他也沒有再到我這裏來。鶴兄已經安抵潘陽總部，却未曾收到他的特殊情報（關於七封秘緘進行情形）。稍稍叫我感到興奮的，僅是W君傳達來的兩次好消息，提到　　和小老說，進行得頗爲順手。</p>
<p>到了二十五日傍晚，忽然收到鶴兄緊急密電，細心考慮了一下，便用秘密方式把全部內容轉達W君站台，並提議請他趕緊決定行動計劃，迅速通知。不到半小時，回電來了，說明張自忠和秦德純方面，由W君自己負責轉達，再由張秦二人，轉呈宋哲元，同時由我就近去見王冷齊面談。王氏方面，已由W君用電話介紹過了。</p>
<p>究竟是什麽一回事呢？如今事過境遷，重新提起，從一方面說，可以證實，日人自來行事，皆是破落戶的一貫作風；陰險，無賴，凶殘，狡詐。從另一方面看，也可說是一個笑話奇話。原來自從七七以來，日人所弄的魔術手法，一套一套都被我們戳穿；文來文對，武來武擋，就沒有讓他達到目的，所以惱羞成怒。這回，由參謀部決定發動一個什麽「三步進行曲：」預備第一步；實行綁架，我北區一帶重要人物，實行什麽「劫持案內」。</p>

<h3>青年團來函</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>昨天接到三民主義青年團的一封來函，原函開頭便是：「你還記得，你曾經對我們建議，就我們團部塲地，建立兒童公園這件事情嗎？現在我們已經決定，先行試辦托兒所，來回答先生和社會對我們的殷切期望……」</p>
<p>我讀到這裏時，十分感奮，青年團是個充滿了朝氣的機構，白話文的公函，而且把過去的事情聯緊起來，足以證明主管人有見解有計劃；可是再往下一讀：</p>
<p>「茲將該所緣起簡章送奉一份，請在貴報刊載，如荷登高一呼，廣爲介紹，使我們工作得能開展，尤爲感禱；　　……」</p>
<p>那一套公文程式又出現了。</p>
<p>雖然如此，我對於青年團上海支團部的工作人員的精神，衷心還是敬佩的。聖經上說：小事上忠心，大事上必忠心。他們有勇氣前進，不忽略細末（我一個月前的一個小建議），凡比俱足以證明他們的努力向上</p>
<p>國民黨以外的人士往往有這樣的一個一致的批評，黨內同志也如此，他們認爲主義是好的，同志却缺少努力；此次牯嶺的青年團全國代表大會，總裁特別寄厚望於青年團，全國青年團的幹部倘能把握時機，積極奮鬥，表現着活躍，英勇，革命，朝氣，對於國民黨不啻注入一股新的血液，而對於國族也更是一大貢獻。</p>
<p>上海支團部的責任，在這樣情況下，也就更特別重大了。</p>

<h3>偷天換日的玩意兒</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>照片一向被人們認爲決無誤訛的「眞憑實據」。但是，有人却也可利用改頭換面的技巧假製照片，使人眞假莫辨。</p>
<p>這裏介紹一些照片的把戲。</p>
<p>在今天，全美數千學校中，還都掛着一張傾斜而立的林肯總統的肖像（圖二右），誰會懷疑這張照片中的林肯並非純然是林肯的本身？看了左圖，你就會恍然大悟了，原來攝影家搞的移花接木的把戲。——因爲傾身的林肯的照片非常少，所以有人想出妙計，把約翰·柯爾亭（就是左圖中的人）的照片中的頭「斬」了下來，而把林肯的頭繪在他的肩膀上，於是就成了這樣一張天衣無縫的林肯像。</p>
<p>好萊塢明星愛洛爾弗林的照片也曾被潑林斯頓大學的學生會［整容］過－將他的兩撇小鬍子［剃］掉，另外加上一堆水手式的頭髮－變成了［一九四〇年標準潑林斯頓大學生］。</p>
<p>「圖一」是美國時代雜誌玩的惡作劇：圖中崩坍的大廈是威斯康新州的首府。看了這幅照相誰不相信它已崩坍了；所以這張照片刊出後，市民紛紛到時代雜誌辦公處去探詢眞相，電報也不斷而來。但是這些天眞的讀者們，太注視這張照片的本身了，而忽略了圖外那小小的標題——「愚人節」。</p>
<p>圖二：林肯的頭被搬家。（詳情見“偷天換日的玩意兒”一文）</p>
<p>圖三：假的幼年希特勒</p>
<p>圖三左邊那張照片想讀者大半都曾見過的，而且也忘不了那個標題：「幼年時代的希特勒」。</p>
<p>老實說，那張照片中可憎的孩童的確不是幼年時代的希特勒。　是諷刺希特勒的一張宣傳品而已，還是一九三三年一位痛恨這混世糜主的奧地利人的傑作。他將右圖中的一個美國康涅提格州西港的孩童，改製成左圖的猙獰可憎的幼年的「希特勒」。改好後，他將它傳遍國際。當時，希特勒曾爲此事大大煩惱，幾乎釀成美德外交糾紛。</p>
<p>至於這位奧地利人是誰，却沒有人知道了。</p>
<h3>舊調</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>西諺說「爲服裝華麗而驕傲者，是愚蠢的」。我以爲，愛美固爲人的天性，服裝好看，可以使自己舒服，也可以是人家愉快；但當你有了一件新做的服裝時，必須知道：有了漂亮的服裝，只不過是你的美麗的三分之一，還有三分之一是健康，三分之一是智識；如果三者你都有了，你才是一個眞正美麗的人。反之，如果你是個病夫，如果你胸無點墨，那麼　挺的衣裳，無異是你自己給予自己的諷刺；不但使自己慚愧，而且是人家看不順眼。</p>
<h3>自尊·自卑</h3>
<p>— 亦绂</p>
<p>中國之命運中有這麼兩句：「自尊不是自大，自謙不是自卑。」誠然，自尊是對於自己人格的崇尚與愛護，自大則是失於虛妄的誇張。自謙是敬人有禮的表示，自卑則是對自己的藐視與毀滅。記得陸清獻有言：「人不可有傲態，然不可無傲骨；有傲態則惹人憎厭，有傲骨則凡事不卑汚，不苟且，人品斯正。」有傲態便是自大，有傲骨却是自尊，無傲態便是自謙，無傲骨却是成爲自卑了，這話講得眞澈底。</p>

<h3>最近去世的饒神父－中國難民之母</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>「八一三」戰事爆發，苦鬥三月，我軍作戰略上的撤退，南市二十萬難民以事出倉卒，不及走避，聚集一隅，束手待斃。　　如狂的日軍衝入南市，正欲對難胞行施殘暴，忽然從畏縮的人羣中走出一個白髮長鬚的西洋人，衣了教士裝束，喝止那些襲起刺刀的日兵，他的眼中充滿慈祥無畏的光彩，竟驅使那一羣「人狼」遲疑不敢舉動。</p>
<p>這位老教士是饒家駒神父（Yacquinot　de　besange），他用實踐信仰的行爲，發揮了崇高的宗教精神</p>
<p>二十七年十一月，日軍入武漢，饒神父再度挺身而出，造成問樣的，令人感泣的神蹟。</p>
<p>擅長演說</p>
<p>饒家駒神父，法國人，生於一八七八年。未到中國以前，他在英國研究文學，居留很久。這時他已經加入天主教最有勢力的國際性組織耶穌會」爲會士，一九一三年，他來我國上海傳教，並在徐匯公學，震且大學等校任教，他精通英·法·中·希臘和拉丁語文，擅長演說，舉手投足，半言片語都有感人的魅力。</p>
<p>他曾公開對震且學生談話：「幹社會事業的人，應該多交際，活動，多識朋友和研究心理，因爲社會是人的集團，在它裏面服務，就非澈底了解它不可，否則事業便無成功的希望。」所以他的友好甚多，中日歐美各國的友人都有。</p>
<p>熱心助人</p>
<p>除了當戰爭期內，他親向日軍交涉，先後成立上海南市和漢口市區兩［難民區］以外，在中國參加的慈善事業很多，過去他曾任「大上海社會救濟委員會委員」，「擊洋議賑會副會長」等職。</p>

<h3>National Army Advances on Zhangjiakou from Multiple Routes; Communist Forces Withdraw Entirely from the Siege of Datong; Fu Zuoyi's Troops Continue Southward in Pursuit</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 10th] The National Army is advancing on Zhangjiakou from multiple routes. The Communist forces near Zhangjiakou still have approximately ten units, but their strength is weak and difficult to sustain. According to sources in Zhangjiakou, in addition to preparing for demolition, they issued an emergency appeal to the city's 170,000 residents on the 19th in the name of the Municipal Party Committee, calling on citizens to actively participate in the "self-defense war." Furthermore, the Xinhua News Agency reported from Zhangjiakou on the 19th, acknowledging that the Communist forces attacking Datong have already completely withdrawn.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, This Newspaper, 10th] It is reported that after capturing Xuanzhen on the afternoon of the 19th, Fu Zuoyi's troops are currently continuing their advance. It is rumored from Zhangjiakou that the Communist forces have gathered 300,000 troops, but they are showing signs of wavering. It is expected that the National Army will be able to enter Zhangjiakou smoothly.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, responded to reporters' inquiries today regarding the Zhangjiakou and Datong issues, stating: Whether the National Army will recover Zhangjiakou is entirely dependent on the orders of the higher authorities. It is not impossible even without progress in the Nanjing negotiations. However, the claim that the National Army has already pressed on Zhangjiakou is completely unfounded. The National Army in the Jehol region has recovered Fengning, northwest of Chengde. The National Army's actions have not yet crossed the Jehol border. When asked how long it would take to recover Zhangjiakou, Wang stated that while a week is short, it would not extend to several months. The National Army has this confidence. Regarding the strength of the Communist forces defending Zhangjiakou, Wang stated that the combat-ready forces are approximately 20,000. Wang also informed reporters that the siege of Datong has been lifted. The Communist forces have lost the ability to attack Datong. Fu Zuoyi's troops, continuing south, can join forces with the troops attacking from Datong near Datong.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] A spokesperson for a senior agency denied today that the National Army has begun operations against Zhangjiakou, stating that there has been no significant development, but the situation is favorable to the National Army. They vaguely mentioned the overall situation but stated that there may be significant developments by the end of the month. Senior personnel from various military command agencies here are frequently in contact.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] The battle for Zhangjiakou is currently brewing. This afternoon, the last batch of relief supplies, 490 tons, from the Executive Headquarters in Qinglongqiao was transported to Miaozhuang in the Communist area. Since this batch of government-promised supplies has been completely transported, it is expected that the situation there will become tense in the short term. However, both sides are currently in the mobilization stage, and a major battle may not occur within a week. According to Zhu Sai'an, a staff member of the Executive Headquarters who came to Beiping from Zhangjiakou today, Zhangjiakou is accelerating the evacuation of people and supplies and has now become a half-empty city. Trains from Zhangjiakou to Miaozhuang and westward are dedicated to military transport, and passenger tickets have been discontinued. Both the Executive Headquarters and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) cannot distribute relief supplies to various counties because the Communist forces are mobilizing. Currently, two staff members from the Executive Headquarters and three from UNRRA remain in Zhangjiakou, while Miaozhuang has three from the Executive Headquarters and one from UNRRA.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] The Executive Headquarters will dispatch a plane to Zhangjiakou tomorrow to pick up the Executive Sub-Committee. The Executive Headquarters dispatched a plane to Zhangjiakou today to convey orders. The claim that the airfield there has been destroyed is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Amidst the tense situation in Zhangjiakou, the government and American radio stations of the sub-committee stationed there by the Military Mediation Department have been forced to dismantle by the Communist forces and have lost contact with this side. The Military Mediation Department is preparing to dispatch a plane to pick up the sub-committee back to Beiping as soon as it obtains the consent of the Communist forces. It is also learned that the Military Mediation Department is planning to send another sub-committee to Guihua, possibly led by Nanpu, but this has not yet been officially decided.</p>
<h3>It is Reported That Fu Zuoyi Telegraphed Mao Zedong, Hoping That the Communist Party Would Change its Style, Thoroughly Abandon Military Force, and Participate in the Government</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 10th] Fu Zuoyi, Commander of the Twelfth War Zone, today released "A Telegram to Mao Zedong," appealing for peace, totaling over 3,000 words. He stated that the Communist attack on Datong forced the National Army to take rescue action. In the Battle of Jining, the Communist forces suffered over 20,000 casualties, and Mao Zedong should not shirk his responsibility. The bloodshed from the Baotou battle until now is a lesson for the Communist Party, which should recognize and reflect on it, thereby changing its past style, exploring new lines, thoroughly abandoning military force, participating in the government, and ending the war. The government has no desire to fight the Communist Party. Finally, Fu Zuoyi expressed hope that Mao Zedong would immediately participate in the government under the premise of nationalizing the military and democratizing politics, and recommend that the Communist Party or others replace Fu Zuoyi's position. [Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Guihua, 10th] The text of Commander Fu Zuoyi's telegram to Mao Zedong is as follows: To Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, Since Japan's surrender last year, you launched an attack on Baotou, firing the first shot of the civil war. The ignorant like me thought at the time that this was a temporary or partial action on your part and would not become your party's policy. Therefore, I telegraphed you on October 24, making a frank and sincere appeal. However, the tragic facts of the past year have proven that this was a long-prepared plan, not an accidental mistake, and therefore negotiations have been fruitless, and the overall war has continued to escalate. Recently, due to your betrayal of promises and the siege of Datong, the government's efforts to resolve the situation peacefully have been completely unsuccessful. The National Army of this war zone was forced to take action to rescue Datong. However, this is painful and not pleasant. Its purpose is only to relieve the siege of Datong and rescue the 20,000 citizens of Datong. However, you believe in the omnipotence of military force and mobilized 17 brigades and 51 regiments in an attempt to annihilate the National Army in Jining. The fierce urban and suburban warfare continued for four days, and finally you were defeated. The day before your defeat, Yan'an broadcast that the National Army of this war zone had been completely surrounded, completely defeated, and completely annihilated by you. But the facts of the next day immediately provided a ruthless proof that it was not the National Army that was surrounded, defeated, and annihilated, but your so-called main forces of He Long's, Nie Rongzhen's, Zhang Zongxun's, Chen Zhengxiang's, Yao Zhe's, who had "participated in the 25,000-li Long March." I do not believe that this is a military victory, because as you said, the National Army of this war zone has the worst weapons, the fewest personnel, and the weakest combat power, and its desire for war is not as strong as yours. Although failure seems inevitable, we did not fail, but you failed. Therefore, this is not a military victory, but must be called a victory of the people's will. In this battle, the bodies you left on the battlefield numbered at least 20,000. We buried them with tears in our eyes. During your retreat, fearing pursuit by the National Army, you desperately fled, with blood gushing from your mouths and noses, collapsing on the roadside everywhere. What a tragic picture this is! I cannot help but ask, who killed them? I press my heart and ask myself, if the war is for my personal desires or the private interests of a few people, then I killed them. I am the greatest sinner, and I should suffer divine punishment. If they are under your wrong leadership, engaging in rebellion and harming the country and the people, then you killed them. You should be condemned at night when everyone is quiet and punished by the people of the whole country. Now it is indeed at a turning point. After a year of bloody lessons, you should be alert, re-examine your policies, and re-study your lines. A political party representing the people, when deciding on policies, should always ask the people what they hate the most and what they need the most. What the people hate the most today is the destruction of transportation and endless wars, and what they need the most is peace, stability, recuperation, and recovery. Although you have always promoted democracy, the people do not want war, but you insist on creating war. The people are afraid of poverty, but you insist on using extreme poverty as the capital to expand the war. What kind of democracy is this? You have repeatedly vilified the government. The government has merit and prestige in the hearts of the people, which cannot be shaken by any slander. Even if the government has some shortcomings today that need to be reformed, the people hate you for creating war, hate you for destroying transportation, and hate you for turning over and settling accounts. Compared with demanding that the government carry out some reforms, the importance and urgency of these things are almost incomparable. Because the latter is just a comparison between good and bad, while the former is a difficult situation where the people cannot survive. The people's minimum requirement today is to be able to live in peace and stability and not expect to turn over and risk their lives in your wars. The impact of some of the government's shortcomings on people's lives is simply one to twenty thousand times less than the suffering and death you inflict on the people by destroying transportation and exhausting military resources. Isn't this realistic? Isn't this clear? How can the people sympathize with you and support you? We might as well make another assumption. If you have the power to overthrow the current government in one fell swoop and establish your new regime, whether or not the people agree with your policies, they can still obtain stability. But the military force you rely on to rebel is not enough to realize this ambition. According to your own propaganda, it is estimated that it will take at least ten years. At present, you hope to create a situation of armed separatism to continue the struggle. This proves that you are prepared to continue the struggle for ten years and ten years of war. In the struggle and war, the existing people of all classes will either die in the chaos of war or die of starvation, causing them to be completely destroyed. How can the people sympathize with your ten years of struggle? After the war, there will be no villages everywhere, so how can you realize your goals? Therefore, your ten-year war plan has absolutely no possibility of being realized. Take the recent facts as an example. The National Army of this war zone is considered by you to have the fewest personnel, the worst weapons, and the weakest combat power, but you were defeated in Baotou, again in Datong, and three times in Jining. How can you fight against other elite National Army forces? Perhaps you are prepared to continue guerrilla warfare in the mountains in case separatism fails. But civil war and the war against Japan are completely different. The war against Japan was the unanimous demand of the people, so you can use the name of resistance against Japan to deceive the people into protecting you. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Crime of the Nanjing Massacre is Being Intensified; Three Powerful Witnesses Escaped Death</h3>

So far, of the more than 2,500 cases investigated, three are the most tragic, and the victims have survived death, which is the most powerful personal witness. The first case involved the most victims. At that time, 900 people were tied to the execution ground by the Japanese invaders. Under the sweeping fire of four machine guns, very few were spared. Although the general public who were harmed were spared, they were also very frightened. In the case, more than 50 Chinese people were killed by the Japanese invaders with machine guns, rifles, and bayonets. Bai Hongen, who was spared at the time, still has bullet marks behind his left ear and is deaf in both ears and lives in extreme poverty. The victim in the third case was a pregnant woman with six months of pregnancy who was stabbed 33 times for refusing to be raped, and the six-month-old baby was also stabbed. Today, I often feel pain in my family when it rains. These bad deeds were mostly done by the Nakajima Unit, and Tani Hisao was the commander who entered the city at that time, so the people of the capital hope that this blood feud can be washed away as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Marshall Visits Foreign Minister Wang to Expand the Scope of the Five-Person Group Talks; The Special Envoy is Exchanging Opinions with Both Parties</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th, This Newspaper] Special Envoy Marshall came late and always went to Chushan on Friday, but this is an exception, which may be related to the expectation of Zhou Enlai's return to Beijing. At 11:00 a.m., Special Envoy Marshall arrived at the Ninghai Road residence and talked with the special envoy for an hour. Their conversation still focused on the National-Communist negotiations, but there were no new plans. They are still hoping that Zhou Enlai will return to Beijing as soon as possible.

He left at 7:40 p.m. The content of the conversation is unknown. It is believed that in addition to talking about the Paris Peace Conference and the situation of the National Army, the current negotiation issues must have been involved.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th, This Newspaper] After visiting Special Envoy Marshall in the morning, the special envoy also visited the Communist people, talked for a while, and did not return to the embassy. This is the highest expression of civilian spirit. At 4:00 p.m., Wang Bingnan visited Ambassador Stuart, reviewed the situation of the talks in recent days, and studied the disputes between the three and five people, but there were no new opinions. As for the Soviet Ambassador's visit to Ambassador Stuart yesterday, it was purely a diplomatic visit and had nothing to do with this. Chuan Jianbo told reporters: "Don't be nervous," and some people spread the rumor that the political negotiations will be moved to Shanghai. Chuan said that this matter is impossible.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] According to reliable sources, the American mediator in the political negotiations is now definitely considering the possibility of expanding the scope of the informal five-person group talks with Zhou Da. Special Envoys Ma and Si Nan still believe that the political negotiations should first be handled by the five-person group, Jiang Shou. Currently, Special Envoy Si is constantly exchanging opinions with representatives of the government and the Communist Party on expanding the scope of the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Associated Press, Ben Tao News] Chen Shenkang, a spokesman for the Central Nanjing Delegation in Shanghai, declared this evening: Zhou Enlai plans to put forward a final proposal, reconvening the three-person meeting. If this proposal is rejected by Marshall and the government, the Communist Party will announce the records of the Nanjing peace negotiations.</p>

<h3>British Pacific Fleet Commander Sir Bruce Fraser Arrives in Nanjing to Exchange Opinions on Assisting with Naval Training</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Sir Bruce Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, arrived at Xiaguan on the cruiser HMS Belfast at 10:00 AM on the 20th. The destroyer HMS Trafalgar accompanied it. The HMS Belfast immediately fired a 21-gun salute to pay respects to the Republic of China. At the same time, the Chinese national flag was hoisted high on the mast. The Chinese gunboat Yong Sui also hoisted a flag in response. The waters of the Yangtze River were turbid and shallow, making it difficult for the ten-thousand-ton flagship and its escorting destroyer to navigate. Two smaller vessels led the way at the river entrance, slowly moving upstream. After the HMS Belfast dropped anchor in the middle of the river, the first to board the ship to welcome Sir Bruce Fraser was Director Li of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Protocol Department. British Embassy Counselor Yellinger and British Naval Attaché Colonel Smith, as well as General Gui Yongbin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Navy, followed. A Chinese naval honor guard and a Royal Marines guard of honor, along with a military band, lined up on the shore to play music in salute. Sir Bruce Fraser went ashore at 11:00 AM, first visiting Ambassador Stevenson and General Wyatt. At 11:30 AM, he went to the Naval Headquarters to return the visit to Deputy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing. At 12:30 PM, he accompanied Ambassador Stevenson to a banquet hosted by Marshal Ma. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, he visited Foreign Minister Wang, and at 3:30 PM, he visited Minister Bai.

<h3>Fourth Administrative District of Zhejiang Province Decides to Implement Cooperative Farms, Divided into Public Land System and Private Land Joint Operation System</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] The Fourth Administrative District of Zhejiang Province has decided to implement cooperative farms this year. According to Commissioner Li Chu Kuang of the district, speaking to this newspaper's reporter, these farms are divided into two types: the public land system and the private land joint operation system. The former is for tenant farmers, and the latter is for landlords and self-cultivating farmers. Two or more farms will be established in each county, and the entire district can establish about twenty small farms of more than one hundred acres each. Farmers do not have to join with all their land and property and can retain a portion for free production. Those who have joined will still mark their boundaries to avoid disputes when they withdraw. Because the government can supply seeds and agricultural tools to facilitate their labor and production, Commissioner Li observes that many farmers will participate. Currently, Li is actively applying to the provincial government and the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan for various seeds and small agricultural machinery to put Zhejiang agriculture on the path of collective production.</p>
<h3>Xie Yingzhou Discusses the Work of Adjudicating Traitors, Which Can Be Concluded Within Six Months; Suggestions from the Shanghai City Council Should Be Valued</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Xie Yingzhou, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, told this newspaper's reporter on the 20th: The seven measures for reporting traitors proposed by the Shanghai City Council have been seen in the newspapers, and the government will value the suggestions of representative bodies. It is said that the authorities have always been very cautious about the work of adjudicating traitors. Those with solid evidence have mostly been tried. The cases that have been concluded so far are mostly complex and require evidence to be collected from various places. Because the work of adjudicating traitors is even more important than ordinary cases, a hasty decision cannot be made. Xie went on to talk about the work of adjudicating traitors in various places, believing that the general situation is still satisfactory. For example, the Capital High Court has tried many traitor cases since April and May of this year, and other places such as Shanghai, Beiping, and Guangzhou are also actively proceeding. According to Xie's estimate, the work of adjudicating traitors can be concluded within six months. Regarding the amnesty, the procedures have been completed, and only the date of implementation by the government is awaited, but traitors and corruption are not included in the amnesty.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Churchill Advocates Franco-German Cooperation</h3>
<p>Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered a speech at the University of Zurich in Switzerland the day before yesterday, advocating depriving Germany of all opportunities to rearm, but that France and Germany should reconcile and build a European alliance based on Franco-German cooperation. He said: "The first step in rebuilding Europe must be through Franco-German cooperation. Only in this way can France restore its leadership on the European continent; without a great Germany, Europe cannot be revived."</p>
<p>Although Churchill has now retired from politics and is living in Switzerland, his remarks and proposals are still valued by various countries because of his personal prestige. It is expected that Churchill's speech will once again cause a great stir in the opinion circles of various countries. In March of this year, Churchill delivered a speech in Fulton, USA, hoping that world peace in the future could be established on the basis of friendly cooperation between the two major victorious countries, Britain and the United States, which aroused criticism from opinion circles in various countries around the world. In particular, the Soviet newspapers criticized Churchill for harboring anti-Soviet conspiracies. This time Churchill's speech will inevitably arouse repercussions from various countries again.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of a third party, we can calmly analyze the current political situation in Europe and know that in order to create peace and order on the European continent, the feud between France and Germany should indeed be resolved rather than perpetuated. From the perspective of Easterners, this is especially true. For the sake of European peace, and also for the future of France, France should not use retaliatory means against Germany or make various excessive and harsh demands on Germany. Otherwise, the German people will never eliminate the psychology of "revenge," and how can the cycle of revenge and war be ended? Even more fundamentally, there can be no talk of expecting France and Germany to cooperate in building a framework for a European alliance. Humans are rational animals and are most able to accept the lessons of history. No one can deny that no matter what harsh conditions France imposes on Germany, even if it can bind Germany temporarily, making it unable to recover, it is not a once-and-for-all solution. After a decade or so, the bound will harbor resentment and seize the opportunity to take revenge one day. Far-sighted politicians in France will definitely be able to see the advantages and disadvantages. Taking China and Japan as an example, the oppression, invasion, trampling, and humiliation that China has suffered from Japan are truly innumerable. During the war, the Chinese people hated the Japanese to the extreme. However, once the war ended, China, thinking of the long-term plan for peace in the Far East, still adopted a magnanimous attitude and did not adopt a retaliatory policy towards Japan. Therefore, in the eyes of the Chinese people, it is believed that there should be no irreconcilable hatred between France and Germany. Moreover, this kind of national feud, if it exists for a long time, will cause both sides to try to retaliate at the expense of causing war. The incompatibility and mutual hostility between France and Germany have caused countless wars in the past century. Therefore, we also believe that if European peace can be built on a solid foundation, then the reconciliation between France and Germany is an indispensable factor.</p>
<p>However, Churchill has delivered several speeches in the past year, one in the United States, advocating Anglo-American cooperation; another in France, advocating an Anglo-French alliance; and this time in Switzerland, advocating Franco-German cooperation. Putting these proposals together, one cannot help but suspect that Churchill has the intention of organizing a Western bloc to resist the Soviet Union. We not only hope for international peace, but also hope that the United Nations countries, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, can work together to create world peace. Therefore, we cannot casually agree with any plan to organize a bloc to resist another bloc in the international arena. Is there such an intention in Churchill's speech? It is indeed a question worth discussing.</p>
<h3>Why Should Temples and Monks Misunderstand?</h3>
<p>Several temples and five or six hundred monks in the city went to the City Council in a united group to petition. It is recorded that at the City Council meeting on the 17th, the "Requesting the City Government to Allocate Office Buildings for Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Implementation of Autonomy" was passed, in which the second of the five measures stipulated "appropriating or borrowing temples and public buildings," which caused unease among the monks. It was found that in the City Council session, Councilors Wang Song and Zheng Yanyan had strongly argued for the cancellation of the word "appropriating," and it was only after it was revised to "appropriating or borrowing" that it was passed. This case has unexpectedly caused a misunderstanding among the monks.</p>
<p>We sympathize with autonomous organizations that do not have office buildings; autonomous organizations cannot arbitrarily use other people's private property simply because they do not have office buildings. Of course, there are many private properties in temples, and there are managers, but there are also some temples, either built with public funds at the beginning, or by their nature, originally built as public property by the local area, which should not be generalized. As Councilor Wang said in the council, "The general public has its own intentions when building temples, and public buildings also have their uses; autonomous organizations should not apply for appropriation," but after the City Council revised it to appropriation or borrowing, there will be no more abuses. If this temple originally belonged to the local public property, or has now become a ruined ancestral hall or deserted house, then it would not be impossible to temporarily allocate it to the public to make it useful. If it is entirely private property, then there is complete freedom to allow or not allow borrowing, and there is absolutely no fear of usurpation or misuse. There is even less talk of infringing on property rights or hindering legal interests. If the monks of the temple can carefully distinguish, why panic?</p>
<p>As for the nature of temples, it is not limited to Buddhist temples, but also includes other places of religious worship, such as Christian churches and Muslim mosques. Such a provision may cause disputes. In our view, it is also an exaggeration. It is found that freedom of religion is originally a basic human right, which is recorded in the national constitution. Freedom of religion includes the freedom to build and maintain buildings necessary for religious belief. Unless it is a religion that harms good customs, freedom of religion is not deprived. Temples are places that religious believers must go to, so there is a reason to prohibit the closure of temples. Churches, mosques, etc., are even less relevant. It should be noted that what the government authorities previously announced to prohibit was the protection of temples, not the unauthorized destruction of statues or the closure of temples, but not the prohibition of appropriating or borrowing public temples to run undertakings beneficial to the public, and even less involves the basic rights of freedom of belief for all religious believers. If it is said that temples are only for worship and not for other uses, then since the Republic of China, borrowing Buddhist halls to run schools has been common everywhere, and the establishment of cultural and educational undertakings or ordinary commercial markets in local temples, Confucian temples, Yue Fei temples, Guan Yu temples, etc., is also seen at any time. Why is it that only the local autonomous organizations cannot borrow them for temporary use? In short, property belonging to the public can be appropriated, and property belonging to private individuals can only be borrowed after obtaining consent. In this way, it has nothing to do with the sovereignty of the temples, and the monks do not need to worry about their houses being seized. Clearly, the draft resolution has the word "borrowing," so even if the monks who are empty of all four elements insist that the temple is "already owned," their property rights have not been shaken in the slightest, why is there such a strong attachment and panic? Master Taixu Gong, according to the case, is an intelligent person in the Buddhist world, and his understanding must be extraordinary. He must have given good advice with foresight.</p>

<h3>The Course of the Qiantang River Suddenly Changes, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Base is Destroyed</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou Correspondence] The river channel of the Qiantang River between Hangzhou and Haining is tortuous and shaped like a mountain peak. The peak is the Sibao and Wubao areas of Hangzhou. Every spring, the mountain water flows from west to east, and the tide flows from east to west, meeting at the peak, causing the river embankment in that section to be destroyed and flooded year after year. This autumn, the river flow changed course, and the sand fields on the south bank increased frequently. The tide surged violently, pounding the northern part day and night, causing most of the earthen embankment, about several miles long between Sibao and Wubao, to collapse. On the 14th, a section of the Yangzihao area of Wubao had just been completely rescued by the Executive Yuan mobilizing the masses. Unexpectedly, after days of autumn rain, a crack appeared again in the repaired area. The river water in a section of Kunlian Sibao and Wubao actually rushed to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. The road base, about ten feet high, finally collapsed in the rain on the 19th. The crack extends to eight zhang, and part of it has sunk. If repairs are not carried out urgently, the crack in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway will become irreparable.</p>

<h3>U.S. President Supports Byrnes, Demands Wallace's Resignation, Statement That Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Wallace Can Freely Express Opinions as a Private Citizen</p>
<p>Byrnes Truman Wallace</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco 20th Extra Broadcast: President Truman has announced that he has requested Wallace to resign, and said that he absolutely supports Byrnes' foreign policy, which has not changed.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris 20th Urgent Broadcast Washington Dispatch: President Truman made the announcement requesting Wallace's resignation at a press conference today. Truman stated that the U.S. government should be united on foreign policy. It is regrettable to request Wallace's resignation, but Wallace will surely be more comfortable when he exercises his right to express his views as a private citizen. Truman then reiterated that the foreign policy jointly decided by Congress, the President, and the State Department is still in effect, and henceforth no government official can publicly express dissenting statements on the established foreign policy.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 30th Dispatch] President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, exchanged views on the Wallace affair via teletypewriter for 20 minutes yesterday. It is reported that the President will soon issue a declaration on foreign policy. It is heard that Byrnes' concern about the Wallace affair has not diminished due to President Truman's temporary dissuasion of Wallace from speaking. He felt that the President should issue a clear statement to show that he supports Byrnes or Wallace, in order to completely eliminate the current state of unease.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 19th Dispatch] It was learned today that Commerce Secretary Wallace has stated that unless President Truman allows him to discuss foreign policy, he has refused to participate in the Democratic Party's congressional election campaign. It is reported that when Truman and Wallace met on Wednesday, President Truman asked the Commerce Secretary to continue giving speeches, but limited the discussion to domestic issues. However, Wallace refused to limit the scope of his speeches.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Speech Leans Left, Churchill's Speech Leans Right, Same Motive, Different Results, Both Admit Crisis of Conflict with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 19th Dispatch] Churchill delivered a speech at the University of Zurich in Switzerland today, advocating the establishment of a United States of Europe based on French-German cooperation. It is expected that this speech will cause a great uproar in London and around the world, no less than the speech delivered by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wallace a week ago. Observers here believe that Churchill's speech is an extreme proposition for the foreign policy of Western democracies today. Wallace advocated that the Soviet Union should not be treated harshly, while Churchill advocated that France and Germany should join hands and cooperate with Britain and the United States to establish a strong group to resist the Soviet Union. Churchill's intention is to push the current foreign policy of Bevin and Byrnes further to the right, which is the opposite of Wallace's attempt to push it to the left. However, Churchill's speech will not put the British government in a very difficult position, because Churchill is the leader of the opposition party, which is very different from Wallace, who is a current cabinet member. Churchill's proposition of "rebuilding Germany in time, lest it be too late" is very different from Bevin's proposition. The leftists of the British Labour Party will no longer accuse Bevin of following in Churchill's footsteps, so Bevin's position in the Labour Party can be strengthened as a result.</p>
<h3>Churchill Returns to England</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris 20th Broadcast London Dispatch: Churchill and his wife and daughter arrived at Biggin Hill Airport at 3:30 p.m. by Swiss plane. This is different from Wallace's speech, which intended to split the Democratic Party and weaken Byrnes' position. The central idea of Churchill's speech is simply to declare that cooperation with the Soviet Union is impossible. Observing from the position of an outsider, someone as experienced as Churchill would certainly know that advocating that Germany should restore its leading position in Europe at this time would inevitably arouse great suspicion from the Soviet Union. The motive of both Churchill's and Wallace's speeches is to acknowledge the danger of conflict with the Soviet Union, and the two people's conclusions on how to prevent it are different.</p>
<h3>French People Quite Shocked</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris 19th Dispatch] When the evening newspaper published Churchill's speech in Zurich, advocating that France and Germany should join hands to rebuild the European family, most readers felt extremely shocked. The French government has not yet commented, but private conversations among senior officials have expressed doubt about Churchill's proposal. Some political figures also believe that it is intended to prevent Germany from joining the Soviet Union. Communists say this is another attempt to establish an anti-Soviet Western bloc.</p>
<h3>Interlude at the Peace Conference Due to the Issue of Closing Windows, Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Reach "Compromise"</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris 19th Dispatch] There was an interesting interlude at today's meeting of the Trieste Sub-Committee of the Paris Peace Conference. After one of the Soviet representative Vyshinsky's entourage opened the window in the room, Yugoslav representative Bebler wanted it closed. After a few words between Vyshinsky and Bebler, a "compromise" was reached, and the window was half open and half closed.</p>
<h3>Issue of Italian-Yugoslav Border and Trieste Port Remains as per Four-Power Resolution, Various Amendments Rejected</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 20th Dispatch] The Peace Conference today upheld the agreement of the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on the Italian-Yugoslav border and the periphery of the future Free Territory of Trieste. The Italian Political and Territorial Committee of the Peace Conference repeatedly voted down every effort to amend the border. The four powers remained true to their obligations and voted against any amendments, even if the amendments contained the original intention of the four powers. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj insisted on having his previous statement that Yugoslavia would never sign a treaty it considered "unfair" recorded in the committee's minutes. The committee voted 11 times on suggestions to change the periphery of the internationalized free zone of Trieste, rejecting them 13 to 5 in all but one vote. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, and Ukraine sided with Yugoslavia, while Abyssinia and Belgium abstained. South Africa suggested expanding the Trieste area to include Italian cities such as Pola. Amendments proposed by Byelorussia and Yugoslavia would have shifted the Italian-Yugoslav border further west into Italy and expanded the free territory area to the edge of the Trieste region. Czechoslovakia, in order to avoid a deadlock, proposed establishing a sub-committee to seek a "stable solution," but it was rejected by a vote of 10 to 7.</p>
<h3>Security Council to Handle Accusation Against Greece</h3>
<p>Three Different Proposals</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Lake Success 19th Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council continued its meeting today. U.S. Representative Johnson proposed an investigation into the border disputes and international minority issues in northern Greece. He said that a formal proposal on this matter would be submitted after the Security Council discusses Ukraine's accusation against Greece. According to the Security Council's handling of the Greek issue, it is currently encountering three different proposals: (1) Australia proposed that Ukraine's accusation be rejected because it has a political effect. (2) The Soviet Union proposed that the Security Council declare that most of Ukraine's accusations have been proven to be true, and based on this, make certain demands on Greece. (3) The Netherlands proposed that the Security Council urge the governments of Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to make their best efforts to stop the disputes along the northern Greek border.</p>

<h3>London Conference Resumes Yesterday, Bevin Meets Arab Representatives</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris 20th Urgent Broadcast London Dispatch: The London Conference on the Palestine issue resumed at 4:00 p.m. today, with Foreign Secretary Bevin presiding.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 19th Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin spoke with Alami, the director of the Arab offices in London, Washington, and Jerusalem, yesterday. This is the first contact between British government personnel and the Palestinian Arab population since the Palestine Conference was held, so it is highly valued by all parties. It is understood that the discussion was about the future of Palestine in general, and did not touch on whether the Arab Higher Committee should participate in the conference.</p>
<h3>International Labor Conference Opens in Canada</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Montreal 19th Dispatch] The 29th session of the International Labor Organization opened this morning at the University of Montreal.

<h3>Intelligence on Disarmament in Occupied Japan, U.S. and Soviet Union Refuse to Provide to Each Other</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The U.S. demanded that the Soviet Union provide information on disarmament in its occupied area of Japan, but the Soviet Union has not complied. The U.S. representative also stated that he was unwilling to provide the Soviet Union with information on the areas controlled by the Allied Headquarters. The U.S. and Soviet representatives had a heated debate on this issue at the meeting of the Four-Power Control Committee for Japan on the 18th of this month. At the morning meeting that day, Soviet representative Tretyakov spoke, suspecting that the United States was using the Japanese Repatriation Bureau (the reorganized former Army and Navy Ministry) to spy on information about the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Far East. He also demanded an explanation as to why Japan's military capabilities and intelligence were being kept secret by the Americans. The chairman of the Control Committee, U.S. representative Acheson, reported on the repatriation situation in Japan and the work of the Repatriation Bureau, but Tretyakov expressed dissatisfaction with this report and insisted on knowing the "destruction and construction" of Japanese naval bases and coastal defense works. Acheson believed that this was not referring to the peaceful construction activities being carried out in Japanese ports, and refused to continue the discussion. He replied angrily: There is absolutely no question of Japanese naval base construction at this time. In short, the Soviet Union will not be able to obtain any detailed information on the disarmament situation in the area controlled by the Allied Headquarters, just as the Soviet Union itself does not want to provide information on its controlled areas such as Sakhalin Island and northern Korea. The Allied Headquarters has requested the Soviet authorities to provide this information five times, but has not received it. The United States has had to retaliate by refusing to provide information as well.</p>
<h3>China and Japan Plan to Exchange Prices with Each Other</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo 19th Dispatch] The Chinese delegation to Japan said: China is studying Japan's economy in order to know within what range Japan can exchange industrial products with China for raw materials. This is part of a plan for mutual prosperity between China and Japan. It is not yet completed.</p>
<h3>Turks Love Cats, Not Dogs, Cats Fill the Streets, Stray Dogs are Expelled</h3>
<p>[United Press Istanbul, Turkey 19th Dispatch] Cats here are very numerous, more than in other cities. There are no statistics, but from what can be seen, cats respectfully occupy the streets, fill the gutters, and block the stone steps of apartment buildings, which proves that Istanbul has become a paradise for cats. The reason is that there are too few dogs. Thirty years ago, the local authorities expelled stray dogs to a barren island in the Sea of Marmara. Without food on the barren island and no access to the mainland, these dogs had no choice but to cannibalize each other. Presumably, the last remaining dog also starved to death. Now there are probably no dogs left on the island, only the name "Dog Island." Istanbul has become a world of cats. The few dogs that remain are careful and humble, so as not to offend the cats. According to the city's dog management department's report: 137 stray dogs were "disposed of" in June, while only 7 cats were disposed of. It can be seen from this that Turks do not like dogs, but cherish cats.</p>
<h3>U.S. Army and Navy Departments Deny Planning to Attack the Soviet Union, Wallace's Remarks Have Absolutely No Basis</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 19th Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal jointly sent a letter to President Truman, solemnly denying Commerce Secretary Wallace's assertion that American military thinkers advocated using a "preemptive" means against the Soviet Union. The contents of this letter were released by the White House last night. It stated, "Secretary Wallace's letter to the President on August 23 was reprinted in this morning's newspapers. The claim that an attack would be launched against the Soviet Union before it possessed the atomic bomb has absolutely no basis. There is no such idea in the United States, whether in the Department of the Army or in the Department of the Navy. We all know that the responsible officers of the Army and Navy have never made such a claim, nor have they planned an attack on the Soviet Union policy or plan."</p>
<h3>Ambassador Represents Head of State in International Law, Japanese Emperor Should Be Held Accountable for His Crimes</h3>
<p>Defense Lawyer for Former Ambassador to Germany Oshima Said that Lieutenant General Kusaba Died Suddenly En Route to Japan</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo 20th Dispatch] American lawyer Kleinhan, who came here from Nuremberg, is serving as the legal defense lawyer for Japanese war criminal and former Ambassador to Germany Oshima Hiroshi. Kleinhan stated in court yesterday: The International Tribunal cannot try Oshima if it does not try the Japanese Emperor, because according to international law, an ambassador represents the head of state of a country, and even after being dismissed from his post, the ambassador is still protected by diplomatic privilege. Any attack directly against the ambassador is considered an attack on the head of state. Since the court is based on international law, it should respect this privilege. If the Japanese Emperor is innocent, then Oshima is also innocent. If Oshima is guilty and should be tried, then the Japanese Emperor should also be tried. Although Kleinhan's words were reasonable, the court rejected this appeal and decided that Oshima would remain in the defendant's seat awaiting trial.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The Soviet prosecution team of the International Tribunal informed the U.S. authorities today that Japanese Lieutenant General Kusaba, who was escorted here from the eastern three provinces of China to testify in court, was found to have died of poisoning. If it was not suicide, it must have been assassination, and an autopsy will be performed immediately. It is heard that the Soviet Union brought 20 Japanese people from the eastern three provinces for custody, the same as when Puyi came. Kusaba was one of the 20 people. The origin of this person is unknown. The U.S. intelligence department received a report and immediately began investigating.</p>
<p>[Kaizo Publishing Tokyo 20th Dispatch] The prosecutor of the International Tribunal first presented the Japanese Privy Council's review report on the conclusion of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact today. It was submitted to the chairman of the Privy Council, Hiranuma, by Vice Chairman Arai Kentaro five days before the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, that is, on November 20, 1936. It stated that the Soviet Union had strengthened its national power through two five-year plans, and had prepared vast military equipment in the Far East, and adjusted diplomatic relations between neighboring countries in Europe. Its international position was gradually consolidated. The Comintern, which depended on the Soviet Union, expanded its influence in China, Mongolia, and Manchuria. The biggest problem currently encountered in Japanese diplomacy is to be wary of the Soviet Union and the Comintern. On July 28, 1937, the German Foreign Minister sent a secret telegram to the German Ambassador to Japan, expressing dissatisfaction that after the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese army continued to occupy northern China, hindering China's unification and promoting the spread of communism. The above-mentioned German policy changed after the fall of Nanjing and turned into full support for Japan's invasion of China. The Sino-Japanese War entered a new stage. Germany was absolutely neutral in the first stage of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>

<h3>City Budget and Mayor's Submissions to be Decided at Today's General Assembly; Passing the Elimination of Wharf Theft and Unification of Water Police Authority; The General Assembly Adjourned to Next Monday</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) Today, the City Council will hold its 19th meeting in the morning to discuss the city budget and the Mayor's submissions. The issue of horse racing will also be brought up for discussion at the general assembly, and a lively atmosphere is expected. The general assembly will continue to discuss proposals in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The first general assembly of the first City Council was originally scheduled to end today. However, due to the large number of proposals still to be discussed, Speaker Pan proposed yesterday, and the general assembly passed a resolution to extend the adjournment to next Monday (the 23rd). There will be a break on Sunday afternoon due to lack of space at the venue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mayor Mi's report on governance was passed by the general assembly yesterday, with each group nominating one representative for joint review. The representatives are: Zhu Wende from Group 1, Jiang Pingfan from Group 2, Lu Shidao from Group 3, Wang Xianqing from Group 4, Wang Zhuyi from Group 5, Tong Hangbai from Group 6, Shui Xiangyun from Group 7, Pang Jingzhou from Group 8, Xu Yongzuo from Group 9, and Tao Baichuan from Group 10.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the City Council held its 16th meeting, starting at 9:40 AM, with 92 councilors in attendance. After the Secretary-General read the minutes of the previous meeting, Proposals Jing (Police) Numbers 1 to 6 were discussed, and finally, one temporary motion was passed.</p>
<p>The temporary motion was proposed by Yang Guanbei and others: "To unify the authority of the water police to specialize responsibilities and eliminate theft. 1. Telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to clearly stipulate that the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department is specifically established for customs anti-smuggling purposes. Except for investigating and seizing smuggled goods that evade taxes, it shall not overstep its authority to handle water theft and violations of police regulations. 2. Telegraph the government to clearly order the cancellation of the patrolman companies under the jurisdiction of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department to eradicate the hidden dangers of harboring dirt and accepting bribes. 3. Within the Shanghai urban area, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Water Division should be fully responsible for the water surface security, exercising its authority, and all necessary personnel and equipment, such as patrol boats, should be fully equipped."</p>
<p>Yang Guanbei first explained that the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department was originally responsible for anti-smuggling work, and water theft and violations of police regulations were all the responsibility of the Water Police Division. However, the Executive Yuan did not understand this historical truth and ordered the Jianghai Customs Police Department to also manage water security, resulting in the Huangpu River, which belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Government, becoming a "concession." After participating in the Shanghai Port Affairs Committee, I learned that the crux of the failure to eliminate wharf theft lies in this. Because of the division of responsibilities, neither the water nor land sides cooperate, and the port becomes a "no-man's land," with no one taking responsibility, while theft is organized and carried out on a large scale. Therefore, it is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to transfer the water security work on the Huangpu River to the Shanghai Municipal Government for specialized management. Councilors Wang Yansong, Wang Xianqing, and others continued to explain. Finally, it was passed with 94 votes.</p>
<p>Proposal Jing (Police) Number 6 is closely related to the temporary motion. The proposal is to establish a special wharf inspectorate to supervise the customs and water police administration. Wang Jian'e also proposed measures such as the municipal government handling wharf police affairs, improving the service ethics of the water police, and unifying the uniforms of wharf workers. The general assembly resolved to send it to the municipal government for reference.</p>
<p>Volunteer Police - Strengthen Training</p>
<p>Proposal Jing (Police) Number 1: To strengthen the training of volunteer police and establish a militia to increase security forces. It was passed by the general assembly with supplementary review opinions, summarized into the following three measures: 1. Volunteer police are organized according to laws and regulations to supplement the inadequacy of police forces. They should be strengthened through training and expanded in suburban areas, equipped with appropriate firearms to ensure distribution and protection. 2. Since the militia is organized by clear order from the central government and belongs to the scope of autonomy, it should be handled in accordance with the law. 3. The "Bao Wei Tuan" (defense corps) no longer has a legal basis and does not need to be restored.</p>
<p>Proposal Jing (Police) Number 2 was supplemented and passed. The revised proposal is "To strengthen fire-fighting equipment and improve the service ethics of fire-fighting personnel to emphasize fire administration and ensure safety." Councilors attached great importance to the service ethics of firefighters. Yuan Zhaoxin said: "Some time ago, a hardware store on Huade Road caught fire. When the flames were raging, the firefighters tried to extort 40 million yuan from the proprietress." He urged the authorities to pay attention to this. There are a total of five measures. The fourth measure is "Include 1 billion National Currency in this year's municipal budget specifically for supplementing fire-fighting equipment. The municipal government should subsidize the civilian-run volunteer fire brigades in the four districts of Huxi, Hubei, Pudong, and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Rectifying Police Discipline - Correcting the Concept of "Patrolling Catchers"</p>
<p>Proposal Jing (Police) Number 3, the proposal and measures were revised and passed with 78 votes. It is "To request the municipal authorities to rectify police discipline." The third measure includes "Police officers who have served in the former concessions should correct their past erroneous concept of 'patrolling catchers'." Someone suggested adding the phrase "listeners of rumors" after "patrolling catchers," because in the past, "listeners of rumors" often used fists and feet against the common people, which was very bad. Fei Shusheng expressed disagreement, saying: "Patrolling catchers or listeners of rumors are just names; there are good ones and bad ones." As a result, this measure was revised to "Police officers who have served in the former concessions should undergo intensive training to correct their erroneous concepts, and those with poor qualities should be eliminated." The first two measures are about improving the treatment and qualifications of police officers. The fourth measure is "Police officers should treat the people with a peaceful attitude. If there are cases of rudeness or extortion, the people should be encouraged to report them as much as possible. If there is abuse of power, taking advantage of the situation to protect others, or detaining the people, severe punishment should be imposed, and superiors should be held jointly responsible."</p>
<p>Proposal Jing (Police) Number 4 is "To request the city's police authorities to pay attention to the current reforms to be carried out in the city." The general assembly decided to send it to the municipal government for reference along with the original proposal. There are three measures: 1. Prohibit private prostitution and opium. 2. Strengthen traffic control. 3. Eliminate pickpocketing and petty theft. Female Councilor Lu Huimin said: "Private prostitution should not be mentioned in the same breath as opium. After they are banned, where should they go? They should be given ideological education like pickpockets and petty thieves." But there was no response in the general assembly.</p>
<p>Traces of the Enemy and Puppets - Shanghai South Gendarmerie - Quanlu Brand Cigarettes</p>
<p>Proposal Jing (Police) Number 5 is "To request the municipal government to issue orders to its subordinate bureaus and offices, and notify the agencies stationed in various institutions to pay attention to clearing up the traces of the enemy and puppets left in various places in this city." Zhong Yuliang took the stage to explain, his words and attitude were humorous and funny, causing laughter throughout the hall. He said: "Although this matter is small, it is of great significance. For example, the Gendarmerie of Sinan Road</p>
<p>Discussing Financial and Land Proposals - Exempting the Book Industry from Business Tax - Returning Civilian Farmland Occupied by the Enemy and Puppets</p>
<p>At the 17th meeting in the afternoon, financial and land proposals were discussed first.</p>
<p>Should "Second Landlords" Be Banned? Zhou Lianze believes that in the factual situation of Shanghai, "second landlords" cannot be banned, because some houses can house more than a dozen families, and the "first landlord" cannot sign contracts with each family. Therefore, what should be banned is the situation of "second landlords" demanding extra expenses. After discussion, it was revised to "The municipal government should strictly prohibit the extra demands and bad habits of 'second landlords'."</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal by Zhang Yiqu and Ji Hao to exempt the book industry from business tax, Li Wenjie expressed his opinion, saying that in principle he agreed, but he was afraid of affecting the municipal government's budget revenue. Jiang Jizhou believed that there was no need to worry about the budget, because the book industry is related to the national, ethnic, educational, and cultural undertakings, and the government should give it strong support. Zhang Zhongyuan and others also agreed with this idea, and it was unanimously passed without objection.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to urge the government to quickly return civilian farmland occupied by the enemy and puppets, Zhang Xuelian believed that the tone of the proposal should be strengthened. He said: "The last Provisional Council has already proposed that the municipal government earnestly handle it, but it is still the same as before. It would be best for the people to urge the mayor to do it immediately." Pang Jingzhou proposed to ask the mayor to answer on the spot whether this matter could be implemented. The mayor's attitude was very straightforward. He stood up and said: "This case refers to the civilian farmland of the airport. The Land Bureau has already been instructed to investigate. After the investigation, it can be submitted to the central government for handling. If the general assembly passes a resolution requesting the municipal government to quickly and earnestly handle it, then I will definitely handle it quickly and earnestly!" This case was passed with satisfactory applause from the councilors.</p>
<p>In addition, the proposals passed include: (1) There is no need to increase house rents; (2) The municipal government should earnestly build civilian villages in various districts to settle the people; (3) The Huazhong workshop left by the enemy and puppets should be converted into a civilian village; (4) Investigate the abandoned public properties in the urban area and formulate ways to create properties for implementation to make use of them; (5) Request the land authorities to facilitate the land in suburban areas that has not been surveyed and measured and the single contracts have been lost, and reissue the ownership certificates; (6) Request the land authorities to first carry out surveying and mapping in areas that have not yet completed surveying and mapping, and then carry out registration; (7) Request the land authorities to restore the method of virtual money maps for jointly owned land that cannot be divided to avoid disputes; (8) Request the land authorities to restore the pre-war collection method to shorten the time to facilitate land transactions; (9) Request the municipal government to adjust duplicate institutions and improve transfer and registration procedures to increase the efficiency of land administration.</p>
<p>The proposals retained include (1) Representatives from people's organizations should participate in the Housing Allocation Committee; (2) Stipulate that the original lessee of a fixed-term lease has the priority right to lease. These will be discussed together when the Housing Lease Regulations proposal of the tenth group is submitted. (3) Request the Finance Bureau to stop collecting the "Bao Tuan" (defense corps) uniform fee to lighten the burden on citizens. These will be discussed together when the budget proposal is submitted. Hanging the words "Shanghai South Gendarmerie." In the past, the enemy gendarmerie also called it the Shanghai South Team. We now see it, and we inevitably feel a little frightened. Why not use "Nanshi Gendarmerie"? At this time, he took out two packs of Quanlu brand cigarettes from his pocket and said: "Quanlu brand cigarettes are products of the enemy. After the economic goods were taken over, why not reform them? It is truly painful and shameful to profit from the enemy's brand." After he finished speaking, he gave the packs of Quanlu brand cigarettes to the speaker. Finally, the general assembly resolved to send it to the municipal government for handling.</p>
<p>The List of Candidates is Determined</p>
<p>In the council meeting the day before yesterday, it was approved to recommend that the government improve the financial situation as soon as possible, and it was decided to send 11 representatives to Beijing to petition. Yesterday morning, Speaker Pan proposed the formulated list: Xu Jiyun, Huan Yushu, Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Tao Baichuan, Jin Runxiang, Liu Jingji, Yu Zuoting, Xu Guomao, Yang Fusheng, and Wang Xianqing. After the speaker finished reading, Tao Baichuan requested to withdraw and recommended Xu Yongzuo. The speaker said: "It is not good to request to withdraw. What if everyone requests to withdraw? Let's have a vote!" As a result, the general assembly passed the original list.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosong Speaks on the Issue of Allocating Temples</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the City Council's autonomous organs allocating temple houses, according to a written statement issued by Zhang Xiaosong, the head of the Civil Affairs Department yesterday: "After investigating the proposal of the City Council, which was proposed by Councilors Jiang Pingfan and others, and the Review Committee of the First Group decided on various listed measures, when discussing it, I explained the current difficult situation of the autonomous organs of the city in the capacity of a nonvoting member of the city government. As for the allocation of temple houses, according to the regulations of the Supervision of Temples Ordinance, abandoned temples that are ownerless or have little management, etc., can be allocated. Therefore, the so-called allocation refers to legal allocation. The Buddhist Association of this city did not understand this point and mistakenly believed that all temples were subject to allocation, which led to the occurrence of the petition."</p>
<p>Police Bureau's Governance Report - Resolution Draft Passed - Emphasizing the People's Personal Freedom</p>
<p>The City Council passed the "Draft Resolution on the Governance Report of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau" with a majority of 87 votes yesterday morning. In terms of wording, it was organized by the General Assembly Secretariat and summarized the additional opinions of the councilors. The opinions presented in the draft are divided into nine aspects: public security, personnel, criminal, training, opium prohibition, fire protection, social customs, cityscape, and traffic. Regarding criminal matters, the issue of personal freedom was specifically raised. Because there are cases in the police stations and branches of this city where the personal freedom of the people is restricted, and the behavior is not in accordance with the law. The general assembly resolved that, henceforth, except for theft and kidnapping cases where investigation is necessary, and current offenders who must be arrested immediately, in ordinary criminal cases, unless there are serious circumstances and it is deemed that the crime is true and there is a risk of flight, no detention should be imposed. They should be ordered to directly sue to the court. Even if it is deemed necessary to summon them for questioning and release them on bail, it should be transferred to the court for handling at any time. Regarding violations of police regulations, they should be handled as soon as they arrive. As for the traffic problems that are currently attracting attention from all parties, it was resolved to add parking lots and re-divide the driving areas according to the pre-war method and strictly inspect the vehicles.</p>
<p>Workers of Shanghai Cement Factory Petition - The General Assembly Asks the Authorities to Resolve it Reasonably</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, five minutes before the adjournment of the Council meeting, Speaker Pan asked Zhu Xuefan to report on the reception of the petition of workers from the Longhua Huashang Shanghai Cement Factory. Zhu said: "I was ordered to receive all the petitioning workers, and now this problem is very serious. The authorities of the Longhua Huashang Shanghai Cement Factory posted a notice of shutdown on the 17th (Sunday) when the workers were not working in the factory. On the morning of the 18th, when the workers went to work, the police were densely stationed at the factory gate, and two red police cars were parked with machine guns, preventing the workers from entering the factory. Fortunately, the workers were quite rational and did not cause any accidents. We know that in order to maintain social stability, the government has already issued a clear order: workers shall not strike or slack off at will, and factory owners shall not close factories or dismiss workers at will. This is based on the four principles of the Ministry of Social Affairs for resolving labor-management disputes and the five measures set by the mayor. I finally put forward a temporary motion: Request the Social Bureau to quickly and reasonably resolve the dispute at the Longhua Cement Factory." Finally, the general assembly passed a resolution: "Request the municipal government to order the Social Bureau and the Police Bureau to handle it according to law."</p>
<p>Passing Health Proposals</p>
<p>Proposal No. 1 on Health: After discussion and revision, the following five measures were passed to improve general environmental hygiene: (1) Please move the autopsy site of Tongren Fuyuan Hall to the suburbs or merge it with the Jiaozhou Road autopsy site. (2) Please move the temporary coffin storage sites in the urban area to the suburbs, and order the families of the coffins in the current coffin storage sites to bury them, otherwise the Health Bureau will choose a place to bury them deeply, but a sign must be erected. For exposed corpses and coffins in the suburbs, they should be ordered to be buried on a regular basis. (3) Increase suburban pools and expand tap water pipes. (4) Please increase the number of latrines and garbage bins in the alleys and cooperate with the district offices to supervise the Baojia heads to carry out cleanliness campaigns and inspect the cleanliness of the alleys. (5) Please strictly inspect and improve the tap water source.</p>
<p>Proposal No. 2 on Health: The measures to strengthen and improve the city's medical institutions were also slightly revised. The measures are to increase civilian clinics that provide free medicines in the suburban administrative districts, eliminate the malpractices of hospitals refusing to admit patients and discussing consultation fees before providing treatment for emergency cases, stipulate the consultation procedures for public and private hospitals and set up free beds, and use public vacant land and houses as much as possible to add hospitals.</p>
<p>Proposal No. 3, please order the municipal government to repair the dung trucks and strictly prohibit the removal of feces before 8:00 AM every morning, and prohibit the dumping of feces at will, and Proposal No. 4, please order the municipal government to thoroughly clean up the city's garbage, and Proposal No. 5, restore the suburban vegetable fields, were all passed without objection.</p>
<p>Proposal No. 6 on Health: After the original proposer Fan Shouyuan explained the significance of the proposal to promote the blood type testing of the city's citizens, it was resolved to send it to the Health Bureau for reference.</p>
<p>Real Estate Cannot Be Used as Collateral - The Banking Industry Requests Improvement</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the discussion of health proposals ended here. Finally, the speaker proposed a temporary motion, which was a letter from the Banking Industry Association and the Money Industry Joint Association, stating that since real estate is inconvenient to be used as a guarantee for loans, the restoration and construction of the city's industry and commerce has suffered great resistance, and they urgently hope that there can be some improvement. The letter listed five key points. After discussion by the general assembly, it was decided to convey the fourth point, "The draft Banking Law limits the maximum period for banks to resell real estate after accepting it to only one year, which reduces the value of the excellent collateral," and the fifth point, "Banks such as China Communications and Agriculture Bank do not allow real estate to be used as collateral for funding for industry and commerce," to the central government and hand it over to the members of the delegation selected this time to petition in Beijing as one of the petition requirements.</p>
<h3>Outside the Racecourse: A Desolate Past, Now Golden Ground</h3>
<p>Wu Zhilao Recounts the Past with Eloquence, Like a Dream: The Scenery of Tibet Beside Us, the Small Teahouse at Zhou Jingbang Head, Mayor Wu Believes Recovery Within Two Years is Possible</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The two-week Municipal Assembly is nearing its "finale," and councilors have been discussing the "horse racing" issue outside the assembly for over ten days. Will these "horses" "run" or not? The decision will be made today? To ensure that everyone understands the truth of the racecourse before making a decision, our reporter previously interviewed Councilor Chen Cunren, known as the "racecourse history expert," who kindly shared the original history of the racecourse with the reporter for publication (as published in this newspaper on the 15th). However, fearing that the records in books might be inaccurate, he also interviewed several Shanghai scholars in the past few days and conducted a study with Mayor Wu. Here, the reporter has obtained some supplementary materials:</p>
<p>As a result of Councilor Chen seeking the opinion of Mr. Wu Zhihui, the elder statesman also opposes horse racing in the city center area (i.e., the current racecourse). He said: Fifty years ago, the current Tibet Road was called Zhou Jingbang, which foreigners called Route de la Protection. At that time, this road was a creek (浜). How wide was the creek? It is said that it could accommodate two large boats carrying fifty dan of rice each. Except for a three-room teahouse at the original site of the New World amusement park, both sides of the creek were completely desolate. After the "Mud City Battle," the British used a horse to enclose the land, and that horse started enclosing the land from the Middle Mud City Bridge, not the South Mud City Bridge.</p>
<p>When mentioning the councilors' proposal to build a "Cultural City" at the racecourse, Mr. Wu advocated that the most important thing in the Cultural City should be to establish a "vocational training school for all subjects," with classes day and night, tuition-free, and complete with all kinds of academic equipment. He said: In London, England, there are more than ten such schools, called "Polytechnic," where anyone can enroll. At the same time, he also talked about his own plan. In the second year of the Republic of China, Mr. Wu, along with Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and others, planned to build a three-story building similar to a Cultural City next to the racecourse, from the current Jinmen Hotel to the International Hotel, for academic research. At that time, the Kuomintang headquarters had raised this sum of money, but it was disrupted by real estate developers and failed to materialize. Speaking of this, the old man smiled with great hope and said: "If the Cultural City can really be built in the racecourse, the Kuomintang's hopes in the early years of the Republic of China can also be realized."</p>
<p>It is said that Wu Jianzhang, the Taoist of Taiwan, lost land due to the exchange of documents</p>
<p>According to Zhao Jinqing, a prominent Shanghai gentleman: At that time, their Zhao family's ancestral graves were located within the racecourse. The Taoist who exchanged documents with the British, allowing them to buy land, was called Wu Jianzhang. As for the rumors that the Gu Weijun family's ancestral graves were inside, that is inaccurate.</p>
<p>As a result of Chen Cunren's conversation with Mayor Wu, Mayor Wu also confirmed the need to study the history of the racecourse. However, the new Sino-British treaty stipulates that the rights already obtained by the British should be respected, unless they were obtained through encroachment. According to the racecourse's reply to the mayor, "The racecourse association will comply with the city government's request to acquire the racecourse land at any time." Therefore, we feel infinite admiration for the racecourse's respect for Chinese laws. However, the problem lies in this "acquisition fee." Where can the Chinese find so much money to buy this "real estate"? If the racecourse association wants to use the current land price to exchange for suburban land, then buying a hundred pieces of land of the same size would still leave a surplus! Therefore, according to Mr. Chen's opinion: The mayor should only rely on various areas worthy of research in the past, use diplomatic methods, and negotiate with the racecourse association to recover the land. Mr. Chen has contributed several points of advice:</p>
<p>Proposals to Recover the Land</p>
<p>(1) At that time, the price the British paid for the racecourse land was indeed too low and amounted to a forced purchase. Because they bought the second racecourse (the area around the former Shui'an Company) for 49,425 taels, while they only spent 12,500 taels to buy the current racecourse land of 430 mu. It can be seen that they bought it according to the Yangjingbang regulations at the declared price but sold it at the black market price, which seems to be too unfair to the people. In Colin's "History of Shanghai," published by the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is mentioned that from 1863 to 1866, the Chinese were entangled with the British over the sale of land for three years, and the racecourse association felt very troubled. Especially for the 30 mu of land for the jumping ditch and the 41 mu of land for the training ground, the complaints were the most severe. In addition, according to Councilor Huang Zhenshi's investigation, in the twenty-first year of Guangxu, 120 homeowners who had not received land payments from the racecourse had appealed to the General Chamber of Commerce (i.e., the current Municipal Chamber of Commerce) (the case files are currently being investigated). All of these can prove that the racecourse association took advantage of the treaty and engaged in profiteering and forced purchases. This is a good basis for negotiating the recovery of land rights at a low price.</p>
<p>(2) In the era of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Park target range was originally also a shooting range, owned by the Western Target Shooting Association. Later, the Municipal Council requested that it be changed to a public park. This precedent of "requesting" may also be adopted in negotiations.</p>
<p>(3) As for the issue of shares in the racecourse association, it is no longer possible to discuss it now. The property rights of the racecourse association for the past ninety years can now be definitively stated as follows: The racecourse association has a charter that is indeed very fair and strict, and this kind of organization simply does not exist in Chinese groups.</p>
<p>In 1896, the racecourse association elected 300 "eligible" members, and then elected seven directors from among them. If there is a vacancy for an "eligible" member, it can be filled by an application from an "ordinary" member. The level of strictness to become an "eligible" member from an "ordinary" member is more solemn than an examination. It must be reviewed by twenty members of the review committee. It can only pass if at least thirteen of these twenty people agree, and if any three people object, even if thirteen people agree, it is invalid. It can be seen that under this strict system, bad and unfair elements cannot participate.</p>
<p>At the same time, Article 5 of the basic charter stipulates that in the event that the racecourse is sold, the proceeds from the sale must not be divided among the 300 members, but must be used to purchase a new racecourse or sports ground. The land is unrelated to private individuals! It is unrelated to members, eligible members, or directors! It can be seen that there is a great deal of room for flexibility in negotiating the price of land acquisition!</p>
<p>Banning Horse Racing May Not Be Necessary, Moving It to the Suburbs Deserves Approval</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Chen expressed his agreement with the third review committee's finding that "horse racing is not allowed in the city center area." Because horse racing exists in any international city, and horse racing cannot be absolutely said to be a form of gambling. In a large city like Shanghai, banning horse racing outright would be a strange story in the international press. However, in the city center area, with frequent traffic, a large population, and many places in need of parks and squares, using such a large open space for horse racing is like a huge tumor attached to the heart of Shanghai, which is very unreasonable. Therefore, there is no need to ban horse racing, but it can be moved to the suburbs.</p>
<p>The Municipal Assembly represents public opinion and naturally considers the people everywhere, how to make things convenient for the people, and how to seek welfare for the people. This issue is just one of the hundreds of problems that Shanghai urgently needs to solve, and we don't need to take it too seriously. However, once the highest public opinion institution decides on something, it "decides" to do it, and this major premise of whether to "do" it should not be decided casually.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu's statement outside the venue yesterday: Whether horse racing is gambling or not, we don't need to argue about it here and can ask the central government for instructions. As for the issue of recovering the racecourse, the assembly may wish to authorize the municipal government to negotiate with the racecourse association first. If the negotiations fail, then discuss the response. The land price of the racecourse cannot in fact be estimated entirely according to the adjacent undeveloped land. If the negotiations are successful, it is possible to recover it within two years.</p>
<h3>General Béthouart Left Shanghai for Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Béthouart, head of the French military advisory group in Japan, left Shanghai for Tokyo by US military plane at 9 am yesterday. While in Shanghai, he attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu Guozhen, visited Aurora University, and met with important French figures in Shanghai. General Béthouart was very impressed with this great Eastern city. He served as the French Ambassador to China in 1944 and stayed in Chongqing for a period of time. After the fall of Paris, he went to London to participate in the organization of the Free French government, followed General de Gaulle, and was praised for a time. He was originally a Soviet citizen and became a French citizen. General Béthouart's father was the famous Russian writer Gorky.</p>

<h3>The Treasure Hidden on Fuxing Island Was Swallowed Up. Representatives of the Inspection Team of the Municipal Assembly Received a Secret Report</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] It is rumored that during the enemy's puppet regime, there were gold bars worth 20 million US dollars hidden by the enemy's navy on Fuxing Island (formerly the fish market). It is said that they were swallowed up by the staff of the Fisheries Materials Storage Station of the "Administrative Relief Executive." Representatives of the Municipal Assembly participating in the investigation team received a secret report on this case yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the long-standing rumor, the Director-General of the Administrative Relief Executive and the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Envoy's Office have also received the secret report. According to the Fisheries Materials Storage Station of the Administrative Relief Executive: Other organizations had occupied Fuxing Island before the station took over. When the station went to take over and organize the houses, no gold was found.</p>
<p>In addition, representatives of the Assembly's inspection team also received a report from citizens regarding the reward for reporting enemy assets to the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, requesting that it be handled impartially.</p>
<h3>The Investigation of Soldiers Forcibly Occupying Civilian Houses Started Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The investigation of civilian houses illegally occupied by soldiers in this city started yesterday, conducted by the Civil Affairs Office, the Police Bureau, and the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, with an unusually tense work pace. The Garrison Headquarters received more than forty secret report letters in one day, and is now sending personnel to thoroughly investigate them separately. Once the evidence is conclusive, they will be severely punished according to military law.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company Switchboard Operators Staged a Go-Slow Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The entire body of switchboard operators at the US-owned Shanghai Telephone Company and its offices on Yidingpan Road, Fujian Road, Bixun Road, and Baliaoqiao Street staged a go-slow at 2 pm yesterday in support of switchboard operator He Fulin's unjustified suspension, demanding that the decision be reversed. After the authorities sent personnel to mediate, work resumed by evening.</p>
<h3>Second Crackdown on Clothing Store Hawkers</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] This spring, the Police Bureau stipulated that all clothing stores must not hawk along the streets in order to tidy up the city's appearance. Recently, however, many used clothing stores on Fujian Road have relapsed. More than a dozen stores have been summoned to the bureau and signed pledges not to re-offend.</p>
<h3>The Secret Report of Corruption in Takeovers Does Not Match the Facts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Takeover Handling Work Inspection Team, based on a previous secret report that Qiu Zhongming, the battalion commander of the Shanghai Navy's First Training Camp, had engaged in corruption during the takeover, omitting items from the inventory, stealing public property, and underreporting the bid price, sent personnel to investigate. According to the investigation: (1) Regarding the portion of the original secret report alleging corruption in the takeover, regarding the use of pianos and radios in private residences, the team sent personnel to secretly investigate Qiu's private residence at No. 1 Gongyuanfang, Jiangwan Road, and found nothing. Then, Qiu replied that the piano was borrowed from the Shanghai Fleet Headquarters and was still stored in the military warehouse, and that there were accounts for the borrowed items. As for the gasoline, it was hidden and not reported by Chen Ruihuang, the former director of the training camp. After two barrels, less than 100 gallons, were discovered, they were turned over for public use. In addition, a Ford car was severely damaged in a collision with a Chevrolet sedan. It was sent to the Haida Garage for valuation and repair. Due to financial constraints and to avoid using special funds, it was planned to sell an old Ford car powered by charcoal to offset the cost. A telegram was immediately sent to the Navy Department for the record. Later, because it was sent to the Navy Automobile Factory for repair, there was no need to pay cash, and the car was not sold. Later, because the Haida Garage requested the dismantling and merging of the old car, the Ford car was sold for 3.2 million yuan. Later, because the Navy Headquarters found that it did not comply with the regulations for selling materials, it ordered its recovery and is still in negotiation. (2) Regarding the portion of the original secret report alleging the theft and sale of public property, including one iron barge and one speedboat sold to Wang Yongrui of the Sanbei Company, the team's investigation found that the bid price was indeed 16.12 million yuan, and the bid form had been sent to the Navy Headquarters for the record. It was also stated that it was sold with the permission of the Navy Headquarters. The original secret report stated that only 700,000 yuan was reported, which is not true. The team has now sent a letter to the Navy Headquarters with the results of the investigation, requesting a strict review and reply.</p>
<h3>A Fire at the Zhixiang Factory Caused Losses of 200 Million; The Military Uniform Industry Laments the Difficult Times</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A report was briefly made in yesterday's newspaper about the Zhixiang Military Uniform Factory on Dongchangzhi Road, Hongkou, having a fire and injuring people due to carelessness. It is now known that the factory recently accepted orders from the Ministry of National Defense's Quartermaster Department to manufacture various uniforms, including 4,000 cotton overcoats, 100,000 pairs of military shoes and leggings, more than 400 bolts of shoe lining fabric, and more than 300 bolts of lining fabric for 10,000 wool vests. All of these, along with the factory's entire wealth, machinery, equipment, sewing machines, etc., were destroyed in the fire, with losses estimated at over 200 million yuan. The Quartermaster Department was immediately notified and sent personnel to investigate. It was generally believed that this was a major disaster late at night and that it was likely sabotage by criminals. According to the person in charge of the military uniform industry, the industry is currently facing many difficulties. For example, each set of military uniforms is valued at 30,000 yuan, but the labor cost is only 2,000 yuan. The insurance premium is 5 percent, which is 1,500 yuan. Adding the cost of buttons and labor, it is bound to lose money. Therefore, businesses in the industry are unable to afford insurance. It is said that the huge losses suffered by the Fuxing Factory this time cannot be reimbursed.</p>
<h3>A Single Guest at a Small Hotel Committed Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yang Fuqi, a guest who came to the Xingxiang Hotel at No. 320 Xizang South Road the night before, using the alias Sun Deming, committed suicide by taking poisonous powder for some unknown reason. When the tea servant Ren Chaoyou discovered it at 7 am yesterday, he had already stopped breathing and died.</p>
<h3>Comrades Who Suffered in the Past Carefully Identified Their Enemies; 21 Enemy Military Police Were Identified and Sent to the Military Law Department to Await Trial</h3>
<p>Victory has passed the first anniversary, but the Japanese war criminals have not yet been fully tried, and a large number of enemy military police with obvious crimes are still detained in the Jiangwan Detention Center, awaiting public reporting from all walks of life. The Shanghai War Resistance Comrades Association specially gathered more than 100 comrades who had suffered in the past, including Wang Weijun, Qi Zaiyu, Chen Fenke, and Shao Xiehua, at 9 am yesterday. They took buses from the Public Works Bureau to the Jiangwan Gaojing Temple War Criminals Management Office to report. The head of the third group, Colonel Jiang Wenhe, received them, and then sent personnel to accompany them to the first detention center. The center, which detains more than 300 Japanese military police, had already been standing in the open space awaiting reporting. Yao Kaibai, the deputy director of the center, accompanied them on a tour. After more than an hour of careful inquiry, 21 Japanese military police, including Usagia Kenjiro, Asahina, Tanaka Hatsuyoshi, Nagai, Mochizuki, and Hisao, were reported. The management office immediately transferred the group of war criminals to the military law department to await trial.</p>
<p>Ms. Qi Qian Yuhua and Lu Nianshi, comrades who suffered in the past, pointed out and questioned the enemy military police on the spot (China News Agency).</p>

<h3>Preliminary Hearing of Major Embezzlement in the Two Railways Bureau - The Gallery Was Packed - The Director Pretends Ignorance While His Wife Abuses Power - Yu Xiangyan Tenaciously Accuses Director Chen - The Merchant's Testimony Is Worth Noting - Demanding Money Even After the Case Was Uncovered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The major embezzlement case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office, and the trial began yesterday in the Third Court of the Municipal Court. Because there were 36 defendants, the trial was divided into morning and afternoon sessions. In the morning, all 18 defendants were railway bureau employees, and a female employee from the Two Railways Bureau who reported the case testified in court about the process. In the afternoon, all 18 defendants (three of whom were absent) were merchants. There were as many as 22 defense lawyers, and the audience was packed. The testimonies of the defendants were quite contradictory, and the case still needs further investigation, with the possibility of new developments. The final court hearing will be held again on the morning of October 1st.</p>
<p>At 9:35 AM, Magistrate Meyer and the prosecutor and clerk took their seats, and the 18 defendants were brought in. Among them, 13 were in custody, and 5 were released on bail. The 18 people stood in three rows. After the prosecutor stated the main points of the indictment, Magistrate Meyer asked each of the 18 people their names, ages, places of origin, and positions, and then ordered Wang Ren·Zhang Kaiyuan·Zhu Biwen to stay for questioning first, and the others to step down.</p>
<p>"Director's Wife" Yu Xiangyan Questioned</p>
<p>The first to be questioned were the three who first collected commissions</p>
<p>Magistrate Meyer asked: The prosecutor's indictment says that the three of you were the first to collect commissions from the merchants? The three replied in unison: No. Clerk Wang Ren</p>
<p>claimed: A total of 290,000 yuan was distributed, given by the section chief. The first time was at the end of the lunar year, 120,000 yuan was given, without specifying where it came from. Zhu Biwen testified: He was a clerk in the Document Section, introduced to the Railway Bureau by Yu Xiangyan, and received a total of 290,000 yuan. Zhang Kaiyuan testified: He was a clerk in the Purchasing Section and received 290,000 yuan, distributed by the section chief, who said it was a year-end bonus. He did not collect commissions from the merchants and requested that the merchants be brought in for confrontation. Asked: In April, when the director went to Hangzhou, did the director's wife summon all of you to her home to discuss the "3-2-2-3" ratio (30% for the director, 20% for the deputy director and section chief, and 30% for the junior staff) for distributing the spoils? The three shook their heads in unison and said: No. At 10:15 AM, they were taken into custody.</p>
<p>The wife has the power to represent the director</p>
<p>Next, Zhang Bokang, the chief of the Purchasing Section, and Jing Weijun, the clerk of the Purchasing Section who delivered the inquiry forms, were brought to court. They testified that the purchasing procedure was that the Purchasing Section would obtain a completed purchase order from the Auditing Section, and then create an inquiry form based on this order. The merchants would create quotations, and then a comparison table would be created, marking the cheapest one and sending it to the director for a decision. Regarding the collection of commissions, they said: The director's wife told me that the director said it was okay to accept gifts from outside merchants. Although she had no position in the Railway Bureau, she could represent the director. I went to the director's house several times, and sometimes the director was home. When he saw me talking about collecting commissions, he would walk away. Later, Yu Xiangyan told me that the director was going to Nanjing and initially wanted 4 to 5 million yuan, so I gave the director a check for 600,000 yuan and 400,000 yuan in cash. The director said he didn't want the check and asked for the cash to be brought together. Although the director (Materials Department Director Zhang Hongtu) did not admit to wanting money, saying it was his wife's affair, logically speaking, how could he not know? They are a couple. The method of collection was not to estimate the price of goods too high, but to have the merchants extract a portion of their legal profits and give it to us. Because they hoped the official business would be handled quickly to reduce losses. The total amount paid to the director's wife was 24 million yuan. The distributed amount was 2.8 million yuan the first time, 8.6 million yuan the second time, 28 million yuan the third time, and more than 29 million yuan the fourth time, which has not been distributed and has been handed over to the police department. The first time, Zhu Biwen and Zhang Kaiyuan came and said that the director's wife wanted us to send a piano. We didn't have money, so we took 1 million from the more than 2 million sent by the merchants to send it over. After that, Yu often came to me to ask for money, saying she wanted to show respect to those above. Whether that referred to Director Chen Bozhuang is unknown. We also sent 6 million to Deputy Director Ding Houfu's office, but whether he accepted it and where the money went are unknown. A leaflet was once found at the North Station, attacking Yu Xiangyan, with a large turtle drawn on it and writing, "If you want to do business, bring money." It also attacked Director Zhang for receiving money from merchants. I didn't know it was illegal behavior because Yu used to be a lawyer. After the testimony, the court ordered him back into custody.</p>
<p>It's Yu Xiangyan's Turn</p>
<p>Yu Xiangyan was brought to court. There was a commotion in the audience. Yu followed the bailiff to the court. Yu testified: She was 31 years old, from Jiashan, graduated from Great China University, and worked as a lawyer for two years, but stopped when the Japanese army entered the concession. She used to be the chief executive of the Central Organization Department. She has been married to Zhang Hongtu for ten years and claimed that she had engaged in speculative business and that the couple's finances were independent. The magistrate suddenly asked cleverly, "I heard you have bad habits?" Yu denied it. She was also asked about her relationship with Zhang Bokang and Zhang Yunhe. She replied, "I met Zhang Bokang through my husband's introduction, and I met Zhang Yunhe when I was a prostitute." She also testified, "Zhang Yunhe said that when my husband went to Hangzhou, he often came to my house suspiciously." Her face turned red when she said this. Asked, "You directed bribery and wanted a piano. Did you know it was illegal?" She replied, "The law is based on truth. As an outsider, what qualifications do I have to direct bribery, and I never asked for a piano." She also claimed, "The cause of this case was Director Chen Bozhuang's planned attack on Zhang Hongtu. Before the case was uncovered, Director Chen had asked someone to suggest that Zhang Hongtu resign. After that, gold was discovered, attacking the Materials Department." "Did Shen Shiji go to your place after the case was uncovered?" She replied, "No." She also testified, "The Materials Department had bribed Chen Bozhuang 5 million yuan. Zhang Bokang and Ye Lianwen asked about sending oranges and cigarettes, but she didn't know the details beforehand. Zhang Bokang is Chen's confidant, and Zhang's defense lawyer was hired by Chen." When the questioning reached this point, Yu's defense lawyer requested that Chen Bozhuang be summoned to the court for questioning. The court was especially considering this. Finally, Yu testified: After the case was uncovered, she went to Director Chen's house three times. The first time, Director Chen called and asked her to go, saying that if she (Yu) came forward, she could reduce Zhang Hongtu's sentence. The second time, they were supposed to meet at a "tea drinking" place (Zhang Bokang's house), but she didn't go because she couldn't remember where it was at the time. The third time, at 8:30 PM, Chen Bozhuang expressed remorse, and he was arrested that night.</p>
<p>Director Zhang knew nothing?</p>
<p>Next, Zhang Hongtu, the director of the Materials Department, was questioned. He denied all the points Zhang Bokang mentioned. He claimed: I didn't know about this embezzlement at all. I don't think my wife participated either. I knew that purchasing materials was easy to be suspected, so I once proposed organizing a materials purchasing committee, with the participation of various department directors to jointly take responsibility, but it was not approved by the director. I graduated from a professional university, studied abroad, and worked in the mainland during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, I wanted to do some real business. I didn't know about this case beforehand. After it happened, they didn't report to me how much commission they received either. If I had known, I would have dismissed them. All I knew were administrative matters. I didn't know about the embezzlement. After the questioning, he was taken into custody.</p>
<p>Everyone Said It Was a Holiday Bonus</p>
<p>Next, Clerk Chen Jingyao was questioned and claimed: He received 890,000 yuan, given by the section chief. Staff Gu Zhenmin claimed: He received 890,000 yuan. The section chief said it was a year-end holiday bonus. Zhang Zelong, the chief clerk of the Material Purchasing Section, claimed: He received a total of 1.22 million yuan. Staff Zhu Peizong claimed: He received 890,000 yuan. Clerk Xia Dingwu claimed: He received 750,000 yuan. Staff Sun Xuesan claimed: He received 200,000 yuan. Clerk Xu Fugui claimed: He received 300,000 yuan. When they were distributed, everyone said it was a holiday bonus. In addition, Li Jie, the dispatcher who was released on bail, claimed: He received a total of 770,000 yuan. Clerk Cai Zhidao claimed: He received 700,000 yuan. Clerk Yu Peien claimed: He received 750,000 yuan. Clerk He Zuen claimed: He received 600,000 yuan. They all claimed that it was distributed three times at the end of the lunar year, the end of the solar year, and the Dragon Boat Festival, and called it a holiday bonus. It was transferred by Jing Weijun and Chen Jingyao. They didn't know it was embezzled money. They have now all returned it to the Railway Bureau Police Department.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Go Along with the Wrongdoing</p>
<p>Next, two witnesses, also the informants, Huang Ruzhen and Shen Guizhang, were brought in. Both are female employees of the bureau. Huang claimed: She was a clerk, and Jing Weijun gave her 200,000 yuan the first time. Because there was no reason, she didn't accept it. Jing then said that it was given from above and there was no need to be polite. She suspected why other sections didn't have it. Later, she talked to a relative and learned that it was a commission. She thought she should submit it to the public and shouldn't take it, so she wrote a letter and entrusted it to someone to report directly to the director. She didn't know the other things. Shen claimed: Chen Jingyao gave her 100,000 yuan. When she asked where it came from, he said it was a bonus for diligence. She was suspicious. The second time, 300,000 yuan was given to her, and he said that the Material Department's reputation was not good, and she shouldn't tell outsiders. Only then did she know everything, so she wrote a letter, attached the money, and told the director. She didn't know about other things.</p>
<p>After the questioning, the court ordered everyone to enter the court to sign. Before signing, Yu Xiangyan asked the clerk to open the transcript of her statement and requested to add: "I didn't go to the 'tea drinking' place the second time, so I made a subsequent appointment at Director Chen's house (Bailey South Road)." She also stated that Zhang Yunhe and she had a grudge and falsely accused her, and Zhang Bokang and Zhang Hongtu disagreed, and Zhang Hongtu had requested to transfer Zhang Bokang, thus forming a grudge. She especially emphasized that Zhang Bokang's lawyer was hired by Chen Bozhuang, and she talked incessantly for 30 minutes. After Yu signed, the court adjourned. It was already 1:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Days of Questioning Business Associates in the Afternoon - Most Admitted That Jing Weijun Came to Ask for Money</h3>
<p>At 2:10 PM, the questioning of the 18 business associates who were released on bail continued. Except for three who were absent, the 15 people waiting for questioning were Yu Zhonglu, manager of Shengchang Hardware Store, Jin Yunting, associate of Heyuan Hardware Store, Li Fenbin, associate of Yihe Hardware Store, Wu Lianqing, manager of Jiuchangxing Hardware Store, Shi Yaoting, manager of Hengfeng Hardware Store, Yang Wenli, manager of Dacheng Hardware Store, Shen Liansheng, manager of Huixin Western Clothing Store, Zhou Jinhua, manager of Yuanli Iron Store, Xu Binghong, manager of Xiangxing Yarn Head Store, Yu Yifu, manager of Daxingchang Hardware Store, Li Xingxin, manager of Liyuan Hardware Store, Wang Yunxian, manager of Xinji Electrical Materials Store, Shen Huiqing, manager of Tailai Hardware Store, and Xin Dingfu, manager of Yixin Printing Paper Store. In addition, Jing Weijun, the purchasing section clerk responsible for collecting commissions, was brought to court for confrontation.</p>
<p>The interrogation revealed that, except for several companies such as Jiuchang, Liyuan, Xinji, Tailai, and Yixin, which claimed that they had never paid a single penny, and Jing Weijun confirmed this, the rest admitted that Jing had taken tens of thousands to millions of yuan. However, they all denied that they had inflated prices or provided commissions. Among them, Shengchang Hardware Store gave Jing the most, reaching 3.11 million yuan. The least was Hengfeng Hardware Store, which only "borrowed" 20,000 to 30,000 yuan during the Dragon Boat Festival. The most bizarre thing was that, according to the testimony of three companies, Dacheng, Huixin, and Daxingchang, after the case was uncovered, the police department of the Railway Bureau escorted Jing Weijun to borrow money. He claimed "Please help me," and they borrowed tens to hundreds of thousands of yuan from him again.</p>
<p>Taking it if Offered</p>
<p>When questioned, Jing Weijun claimed: There were more than 100 merchants, and he couldn't remember clearly. They voluntarily sent the money. It wasn't necessary if they didn't send it. Those who borrowed were all familiar. It wasn't inflated prices. Most of them came to the office to give it to me themselves. I was ordered by the section chief to collect it, and the section chief was ordered by the director's wife to collect it. During festivals, several old customers would send it. New customers who voluntarily sent it were not refused, and I didn't know it was illegal. As for borrowing money from people, he heard that the director and section chief were going to resign, and their monthly salary in the Railway Bureau was only nearly 100,000 yuan, which was not enough to cover the expenses of more than ten people in the family, so he planned to borrow money to find another way to make a living. The interrogation was completed at 3:50 PM. The court held that further investigation was needed and would be re-examined on the morning of October 1st. Jing Weijun was returned to custody, and the merchants remained on their original bail.</p>

<h3>Chen Heqin, Principal of the Kindergarten Education College, Actively Promotes Living Education</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The National Kindergarten Education College, having moved from Jiangxi to Shanghai, has completed its first enrollment process, admitting a total of forty new students. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Chen Heqin, the principal of the college, who kindly shared the following remarks: The slow progress of Chinese education today is largely due to the insufficient change in educational attitudes. For years, teachers have only known how to hold onto books and teach, and students can only follow books and study rigidly. In fact, the entire world, the vastness of nature, and the social environment are all teaching materials, and there is no place that is not suitable for teaching and learning. Therefore, when I promoted living education in Jiangxi, it was because I felt that Chinese education must now be thoroughly reformed. For example, when learning about the method of making soap, the knowledge gained from a book is far less rich and the impression less profound than allowing children to visit a soap factory to observe the manufacturing process themselves. Therefore, the effectiveness of living education is sure to be twice the result with half the effort. Living education is a teaching method without classrooms or textbooks; anywhere can be a classroom, and anything can be teaching material. Its slogan is "Doing, Learning, and Teaching are one." It especially emphasizes the word "doing," because anything becomes easier to understand and remember after being done. Living education has five major systems, including: three major goals, four steps, five activities, ten comparisons, and twelve principles. Its teaching steps are consistent with the educational philosophy of the famous Belgian educator Decroly, which are: first, observation and experimentation; second, reading and reference; third, writing and publishing; and fourth, review and evaluation. In this way, children's knowledge is not obtained from dead books, but first through their own observations, then by finding books to read, then by expressing their opinions on the subject, and finally through collective discussion. The impression gained in this way is very profound, and this kind of knowledge is the most valuable and true knowledge. Finally, Mr. Chen cheerfully told the reporter: "In all departments of the Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School, living education will be implemented from this semester. As for the results, it depends on everyone's efforts, the attention of the community, and well-intentioned criticism and assistance to reach a conclusion." Mr. Chen confidently said: "Living education will definitely have a bright and splendid future. This is something we can believe in, and we have such firm confidence because it is a product of the development of the entire Chinese social landscape."</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Releases Statistics on New Student Applications for Municipal Middle Schools</h3>

<h3>Alumni of the Normal College in Shanghai Host a Banquet for Liao Mao Ru</h3>
<p>The National Normal College was independently founded by Mr. Liao Mao Ru in the second year of the Anti-Japanese War. Most of the wartime middle school teachers in the southwest half of China were supplied by the college. The college was originally located in Lan Tian, Hunan, and moved to Shu Pu, Western Hunan, after the fall of Hengyang. After the victory, it was ordered by the Ministry to be relocated to Nan Yue. Over the years, graduates have spread across the country. Recently, it has been reported that there are dozens of alumni in Shanghai, who have scheduled a banquet for Mr. Liao Mao Ru, the president of the college, and all the professors traveling in Shanghai, at noon on September 22nd, on the ninth floor of the YMCA, and will establish the Shanghai branch of the alumni association.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai: Second Primary School Occupied</h3>
<p>Yesterday, They Hosted the Press, Requesting Support</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The school board of the primary schools of the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai hosted the press at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 20th) at the association on Xizang Road. Chairman Yan Boying reported on the occupation of the Second Primary School building established by the association, stating: In 1936, the association leased land at 539 Gongping Road, Hongkou, and built a three-story Western-style school building to establish the Second Primary School. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was occupied by the enemy and used as a military medical school. After the victory, just as preparations were being made to restore the school, it was unexpectedly taken over by the Shanghai Provisional University of the Ministry of Education. Subsequently, the university leased it to the Shanghai Teachers Training Institute as a dormitory for its students. After repeatedly submitting documents and presenting them to the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the Ministry of Education, and the Municipal Education Bureau to request its return, the association finally received an official reply from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in July of this year, stating: "We have received your submission. After investigation, the property rights of the school building do indeed belong to the submitter. It should be approved for return. In addition to separately notifying the Shanghai Teachers Training Institute to relocate, please be informed of this approval," etc. At the same time, the bureau forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Teachers Training Institute, Shanghai Provisional University, and the Ministry of Education for review and relocation. However, many days have passed, and this has not been done. The association has repeatedly sent documents to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail. Recently, it has been heard that Jinan University, the successor to the Provisional University, is planning to use it as a business school, which would dash the association's hopes of restoring the school. Now that the start of the current semester has passed, they only hope to achieve the desire to restore the school next semester. When Mr. Yan reported, his emotions were very intense, and he repeatedly stated that the Ministry of Education is the highest educational institution in the country. At a time when national construction places the greatest emphasis on education, how should it support the educational undertakings of various regions to enable them to develop and complete the great task of national education? Today, it allows its subordinates to forcibly occupy people's schools, which is akin to destroying education. Therefore, in addition to sending a telegram to the Municipal Council to appeal, it is specially requested that the press provide support and uphold justice.</p>

<h3>Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Discusses Current Economic Measures: Managing the Shipment of Yarn and Cloth to Southern China, Perhaps Also Selling to Southeast Asia; Allocation of Yarn Remains Unchanged; Industrial Loans Can Be Assisted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Wang Yunwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs attended a luncheon yesterday at the invitation of the Sixth District Machine Textile Industry Association. Others present included Wang Xiaolai, Shu Yunzhang, Li Shengbo, Liu Wenteng, Wang Qiyu, and Rong Hongyuan. After the meal, they exchanged opinions on current yarn market allocation and southern transport issues. The meeting ended at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Minister Wang answered many questions raised by reporters from various newspapers. The important points are summarized as follows: (1) The "Provisional Measures for the Transportation and Management of Cotton Yarn and Cloth to South China" have been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The regulations on the amount of yarn and cloth transported to South China will, in principle, refer to the amount of yarn and cloth transported to South China in 1936 and 1937, and then weigh the degree to which the current production of yarn and cloth has decreased compared to that time, and then determine a reasonable export amount of yarn and cloth. (Reporter's Note: According to some authoritative estimates in the textile industry, in 1936 and 1937, taking the four ports of Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou as examples, the average monthly export was about 800 bales of yarn and 116,000 bolts of cloth. In terms of production capacity, the number of spindles operating in each factory in 1936 and 1937 was about 5 million spindles, which has now been reduced to 2.5 million spindles. The actual production has shrunk by about half.) (2) South China is part of the national territory. If there is no transshipment for smuggling purposes, the sale of yarn and cloth to the south should not be a problem. In the future, the sale of yarn and cloth to the south will be increased after investigating the actual needs of the local area. At the same time, on the premise of maintaining stable yarn prices, the possibility of exporting to Southeast Asia will be considered. This will not only meet the urgent needs of Chinese manufacturers in Southeast Asia for cotton yarn, but also obtain foreign exchange for the country. (3) In the future, the Textile Industry Management Committee will be responsible for reviewing the sale of yarn and cloth to the south. Yarn and cloth approved for sale to the south will be notified to customs for release. (4) The issue of cotton yarn smuggling from Hong Kong has been discussed with the Hong Kong government, and they have agreed to assist in stopping it. The case of transshipment and smuggling in Macau is currently being resolved. (5) The second joint allocation of cotton yarn by state-owned and private factories will remain at 30,000 bales. The various allocation methods are roughly the same as before. (6) The method of purchasing new cotton and granting loans is under consideration. It is planned that the Textile Industry Management Committee and the Sixth District Yarn Factory Association will jointly discuss collective purchasing methods. If necessary, the state will provide assistance to loans for industries related to people's livelihoods. (7) The Industrial and Commercial Supervision Office is expected to be formally established next month. The organizational law of the office has been passed. The organization is simple and the purpose is pure. Its purpose is to guide private industrial and mining enterprises and international trade. (8) The Enterprise Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has now been abolished and replaced by the International Trade Department. (9) The Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will be closed by the end of September as much as possible. The various departments that still have unfinished matters at that time will establish another office to close them. (10) A large batch of Japanese rayon is about to arrive. Because it is handled by the Central Trust Bureau, it is imported through barter trade with Japan, so the Central Trust Bureau will decide on the allocation method.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Rises Sharply; Market Rumors Abound; Gold Price Follows, Rising by 24,000</h3>
<p>The Shanghai gold market opened modestly yesterday, but strengthened near noon, still influenced by the US dollar. It opened at 2.147 million and sold well. Overnight gains were also sold. It briefly fell to around 2.135 million before stabilizing slightly and rebounding slightly. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars, and the price also rose to 2.1475 million along with the market. It then remained stable, hovering around 2.15 million for a long time. However, as the US dollar was bid higher and higher, it rose to over 2.17 million along with the US dollar near noon. It slightly retreated at noon, struggling around 2.165 million. The afternoon was even more exciting, rising to over 2.18 million before retreating slightly. As a result, it closed 24,000 higher than the previous day. Decorative gold rose to 232,000. Silver bullion and silver dollars were stable. The implicit interest rate fell to below 0.13 due to the loose money supply.</p>
<p>Foreign currency chips were extremely scarce and could not withstand large purchases. It was weak at first and then strong. Near noon, it returned to a state of short squeeze. It initially sold for 3,440 yuan. After opening, it fell to 3,400 yuan before finding support. After 10:00 AM, buyers were eager, fluctuating around 3,450 yuan. Near noon, the upward trend was strong, and the buying sentiment permeated, rising to over 3,650 yuan. The afternoon was even more intense, with settlement demand high. Rumors arose, and a short squeeze and scramble to buy re-emerged, soaring to 770 yuan before leveling off slightly. As a result, it closed 260 yuan higher than the previous day. The exchange rate with gold converged to 586.5 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars were also passively driven up to as much as 37 yuan.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Rose and Fell Slightly</p>
<p>The supply and demand for government bonds was limited. The process was volatile. The strongest of the unified bonds, C, opened at 2,000 yuan, retreated to 1,890 yuan in the middle of the day before rebounding slightly, rising to 2,030 yuan before settling slightly, hovering between 1,960 yuan and 1,990 yuan near the close. As a result, it closed slightly lower, 20 yuan less than the previous day. The gains and losses of the others were minimal.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Turned Sideways After Rising</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks turned sideways yesterday. Hot stocks turned sideways after rising. Yi Sha opened at 9,300 yuan and English United opened at 11,700 yuan. Hot stocks traded sideways to a low price at the close. As a result, Jardine Matheson, Shipping, and Steel rose slightly, English United Paper fell slightly, and the rest were flat. Cold stocks had transactions. General hot money tended to search for cold stocks.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Cotton Yarn: Goods Come from Allocation; Price Limits Plus Surcharges</h3>
<p>[Datong News Agency] The cotton yarn dealers in this city have expressed to the Textile Construction [Company] that this is the opinion of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Therefore, the cotton yarn dealers will recently send representatives to petition the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The yarn market is trading as usual, and all cotton yarn is traded from goods flowing out of the hands of manufacturers who have received allocations. The prices are all based on the black market. It is said that recently many private yarn factories are also selling goods without complying with the price limits, and are profiting in ingenious ways. That is, for a bale of cotton yarn worth 1.3 million yuan, the customer pays the check and account according to the price limit, and prepares an additional 200,000 yuan in cash as an additional payment, which is not recorded in the accounts, so even if it is investigated, there will be no trace. When asked about this situation, the yarn dealers also said that it has become an open secret.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Are Strong</h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday was buoyed by the lack of sunshine and reports of rising prices from the Jingwu production areas, causing both the northern and southern markets to show vigorous trends. Japonica and indica rice rose by 2-3,000 yuan. Bai Yuan (white rice) also stopped falling and turned to rise. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell 440 bags of Brazilian rice, with a total of over 8,000 piculs registered. Flour sales remained strong, rising another 3-400 yuan. Wheat bran was high and getting more solid, continuing to rise sharply, rising another 2-300 yuan. Broad beans also rose by 1,000 yuan. Shantou and local oil mills were carefully picking up soybeans, and the higher-priced goods still stood firm, rising slightly by 3-400 yuan, but the medium-grade goods remained flat because there were still many arrivals and few buyers. Mung beans have recently seen a sharp drop of 7-800 yuan, as there are many arrivals from Hankou, but sales to Southeast Asia are stagnant, and local sales are also weak. Corn, after days of a sharp decline, stabilized after exhaustion. Raw peanuts could not compete with consumption, boiling up by 4-5,000 yuan. The oil market was balanced between arrivals and consumption. The store side was active but not prosperous, and the situation tended to be flat, lacking any disturbances for the time being. Xinghua and Quanzhou wheat had some sales, and the market was firm and stable.</p>
<h3>Timber: Arrivals Continue; Sales Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Timber from the United States, the Philippines, and Zhejiang and Fujian continues to arrive in Shanghai. Although prices have not fallen, sales are sluggish, and inventories are congested. It is said that there are no less than 100,000 tons of timber waiting to be shipped from Fuzhou, which will take a year to transport by the Linsen and Zhoushan ships. Yesterday, the Linsen ship returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou, carrying over 1,700 tons of timber. The Sumeifan and Co. of the Norwegian shipping company Shunting Yangxing transported over 250,000 feet of timber from the port of Minte in the United States, which is expected to arrive next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Market Was Hot Then Cold; Chinese Stocks Traded Mediocrely</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were buoyed yesterday by reports that the Ministry of Finance explained that there were no restrictions on the overdraft amount for the banking industry, and that no guarantee was necessary. The market was bullish, and prices rose sharply again at the opening. The buying sentiment in the market turned strong, and the dealers took the opportunity to push up prices, with various popular stocks continuing to flourish. After half an hour, the market gradually showed fatigue, and the bulls became panicked again, gradually trading lower. After 11:00 AM, the overnight gains and the dealers were again unable to support the market, and sought to sell, and the situation suddenly became weak. However, there was some short covering on dips, and there were slight twists and turns. At noon, the market struggled at low prices. Only Xin Guang was more active and showed a small performance. The rest were difficult to cheer up. As a result, Yongsheng and Jingfu closed flat compared to the previous day, and Mei Ya and Qinxing fell slightly, while Xin Guang rose slightly. Among the colder stocks, the silk industry rose by half a percent, Tongyi and Huafeng were flat, and Zhongfang, Datong, Xin Ya, and Jinglun each fell by half a percent. The losses of the rest were not much, and the off-market stocks also fell slightly again.</p>
<p>In general, the market situation yesterday was hot at first and then cold. The total volume of transactions was less than 6 million shares. The market for each ticket company rose first and then fell, but the magnitude of the rise and fall was very small. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of each hot stock was only about 2%. The market atmosphere was extremely peaceful and there were no major fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Italian Orders Hit the Market; Rayon Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market continued to fall. 120 Tianqiao Youguang (Bright) closed at 3.2 million yuan in the morning. It continued to fall by 30,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 80,000 yuan less than the upper afternoon. Miscellaneous brands Youguang (Bright) was short by 60-70,000 yuan, and semi-glossy was short by 40-50,000 yuan. The arrogance in the black market was slightly reduced, and there was no longer the prestige of the previous two days. Because the first batch of Italian silk orders has been listed and the foreign firm continues to accept orders, the price is far from the current market, so buyers are waiting and watching. The transaction price of grade 78 D of factory silk was 50,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Medium and ordinary goods increased by 50-100,000 yuan because factory sales were active. The prices of Yu Jing were at the original level. Silk goods were sold at high prices again, and the sales of large fine wool fabrics were not bad, 4-500 yuan higher than the previous day, and the rest were firm and stable. Because workers in Hangzhou are making requests to increase wages, it is feared that it will have to be looked at favorably.</p>
<h3>Shuangma Standard to Be Eliminated During the Second Allocation of Yarn; Cotton Purchases Should Be Free; Remarks by Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Machine Textile Industry Association, speaking to our reporter, after the state-owned and private yarn factories decided to handle the second group allocation of 30,000 bales of yarn, the 29 member units of the Sixth District Yarn Factory Association will gather at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the matters related to the allocation of cotton yarn. It is said that the stipulation that Shuangma brand yarn be the standard will be cancelled during the second group yarn opening. Anyone who meets the standard of 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn can be allocated at the opening price. Also, yesterday's spot price for 20-count yarn was 1.46 million yuan per bale, and the price for maturing spot contracts was 1.52 million yuan per bale, which is too far from the previous allocation price. Therefore, this allocation price will be slightly adjusted. Regarding the matter of collective purchasing of new cotton, he believes that based on past experience, it is not entirely satisfactory. This is because the production conditions of each factory are different, and the amount of cotton used varies. According to economic principles, it is better to adopt free competition. He said: In 1936 and 1937, my country's raw cotton production reached 16 million dan (a unit of weight). The annual consumption of the whole country was only 12 million dan, so there was still a surplus for export. If transportation is restored and raw cotton production is brought back on track, then the supply of raw cotton in our country should not be a problem. As for the main reasons for the current reduction in production by various yarn factories, there are no more than two points: first, the amount of power supply has decreased, and second, the working hours of workers have been shortened.</p>
<h3>Price of Cotton Yarn Increases by 50,000, Both Local Sales and Customer Sales Are Active, South China Also Making Purchases, Tianjin Merchants Most Vigorous, "Dragon Head" Priced at 75,000 with No Goods Available in the Market</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Yarn Mill Joint Distribution Committee convened its regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, resolving to sell a standard quantity of 20-count cotton yarn, totaling 1,054.5 pieces for private mills, fully allocated according to application amounts. The Textile Construction Corporation (紡建) distributed 2,245 pieces, also based on the standard distribution set by Textile Construction Corporation, with appropriate allocation. The selling price, using 400-pound 20-count "Double Horse" brand as the standard, is 1.35 million yuan per piece, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous distribution price. The next sales date has been set for September 23rd.</p>
<p>The market price of yarn is surging, with Tianjin merchants still actively stocking up, and sales on Changjiang Road are also brisk. As a result, prices increased by 50,000 to 70,000 yuan immediately upon opening. "Red Kui," "Color Kui," "Fairy Maiden," and "Double Happiness" brands are all targets for Tianjin merchants. "Large Flying Boat" brand is particularly essential for Jiangxi customers. Consequently, the aforementioned brands are uniquely popular. South China, which had been quiet for a long time, also made purchases yesterday. Furthermore, local construction factories are actively increasing their raw material purchases due to increased sales volume, driving the market upward. The opening of Textile Construction Corporation’s futures market further facilitates adjustments. However, "Blue Phoenix Abundance" brand is no longer as popular as in the previous two days, with the closing price showing limited gains compared to the previous day. The "Double Horse" brand once briefly exceeded the 1.6 million yuan mark but closed at 1.57 million yuan, still an increase of 50,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The fabric market continued to rise yesterday, with the "Dragon Head" brand quoted at 75,000 yuan, but no goods are available in the market. High-end brands such as "Abundant Crane Divine Eagle" are being completely snapped up. Local dyeing factories are the largest buyers. These transactions are all for actual sales. Dyeing factories such as "Hua Feng's Mei Ting," "Mainland's Da Lu," and 190 mercerized fabrics are selling out as soon as they are priced. Low inventory and strong purchasing are creating this phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Extension of Coal-for-Electricity Method for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously established the "Coal-for-Electricity" method to facilitate electricity use for factories. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. This method was originally scheduled to expire at the end of August but has now been extended to the end of November. Factories requiring a certain amount of electricity can directly register with the Fuel Management Committee and apply to purchase coal. Once approved by the committee, they can obtain the necessary electricity.</p>
<h3>Market Ordered to Investigate and Determine Production and Sales Quantities of Flour</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the Ministry of Food recently received a request from the Tianjin Wholesale Grain Merchants Association to lift the ban on flour exports, allowing Southern flour to be transported to the North to maintain food supply. The Ministry of Food instructed the municipal government to investigate and determine the actual production and sales quantities of flour in the Shanghai market, whether there is a daily surplus, and if so, how much. It is reported that this instruction has been relayed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, ordering them to complete the investigation within three days to submit to the ministry for review.</p>
<h3>500,000 Pounds of Australian Wool Have Arrived</h3>
<p>Australian wool was previously under government control, with fine wool of 60 counts or higher and medium wool of 50 counts or higher reserved for domestic use by the British textile industry, restricting exports. Currently, most of the shipments to China consist of lower-grade wool below 50 counts. The British textile industry no longer has a great need for these items, so they can be sold abroad. It is reported that the British merchant ship "Sam Jack" arrived at the port on the 19th, carrying approximately 500,000 pounds of mixed 40-count and 44-count wool, which will be unloaded today.</p>
<h3>Flannel Sales Are Booming</h3>
<p>Fine wool, glossy flannel, regardless of stripes, checks, herringbone, or plain patterns, has been selling very well recently. Standard market prices have increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per yard. Old-style all-wool goods and imported goods are even more popular.</p>
<h3>Li Lai Establishes Third Factory</h3>
<p>Li Lai Chemical Industry Factory, established in 1939, employs several pharmaceutical and chemical experts specializing in the research and development of various cosmetic and daily-use products, producing high-quality items. Currently, there are two manufacturing plants. Due to high demand, the company has purchased 30 acres of land to build a third factory, which is currently under planning.</p>

<h3>Technicians Request Payment of Differential Allowance Funds, Request to Join Municipal Government Cooperative</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a technician working for an affiliated agency of the Public Works Bureau. Our monthly salary, including rice allowance, totals around 80,000 yuan, which is hardly enough to maintain a high standard of living. I have the following two points that I would like to bring to the attention of the relevant authorities for improvement.</p>
<p>(1) In the past, the basic salary of technicians accounted for 80% of that of civil servants. However, since the adjustment of civil servant salaries in June, it has been reduced to 60%. With the approval of the Director, the Municipal Government agreed to increase it to 70% starting from June. However, we are still being paid based on 60%. We request that the authorities promptly issue the 14,000 yuan difference in basic salary for June and July. Furthermore, this month's newspaper reported that the National Defense Council approved an adjustment to civil servant salaries, with police officers and laborers also receiving increases based on the new standards, and decided to implement it starting in August. However, the instruction to adjust salaries has not yet been issued, and the rice allowance for this month has been temporarily suspended. Therefore, our salary for this month is only around 60,000 yuan. We hope that the authorities will, in this adjustment, at least restore the original basic salary of 80% and the additional increment based on base salary, and issue it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) We are not allowed to join the Municipal Government Employee Consumer Cooperative, which prevents us from purchasing subsidized goods at fair prices. What is the purpose of the employee cooperative? Furthermore, with the newly established Public Education Personnel Distribution Center, police officers and sanitation workers from the Health Bureau are busy registering. Why does the Public Works Bureau favor its employees and neglect its workers? We hope that the welfare officer in charge will promptly arrange for us to join the cooperative and register with the Public Education Personnel Distribution Center.</p>
<p>Currently, roads are damaged, and ditches are blocked. Although this is due to a lack of road materials, the authorities' disregard for the living conditions of workers, which leads to low work efficiency, is also a major factor. If the above two points can be implemented and worker welfare is always considered, it will undoubtedly help improve work efficiency. (Liu Shunhua) August 28</p>

<h3>Social Services, Responses to Readers</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Refusal to Hold Wedding Ceremony</p>
<p>Wang Rongsen asks: Since I was a child, I was engaged to a woman through my parents' arrangement and a matchmaker's words. Now that I am an adult, my parents are forcing me to get married soon. Despite repeated objections, it is still ineffective. I had no choice but to run away, but neighbors persuaded me to go home. Who knew that my parents had brought the woman home. My parents did not mention the marriage, and the other party's parents thought their daughter was already married, keeping her in the dark. I have not paid attention to her once in all these days. Now I have four questions, please answer: (1) Is this marriage legally valid? (2) If a notice is published denying the validity of the marriage, will it be effective? (3) If I want to dissolve this marriage, what legal procedures should I go through with the other party now? (4) If I marry another woman, will there be any unexpected problems?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) As stated in the letter, it is legally invalid. (2) To protect the other party's face, it may not be necessary to publish a notice. (3) Use a letter or face-to-face communication to express the reason for dissolving the marriage to the other party. If the other party is not at fault, you should pay reasonable compensation for damages. These damages are not limited to property damage. (4) At this time, if you marry another person, you will not be legally bound by the previous marriage, but it is still appropriate to dissolve the previous marriage before getting married.</p>
<p>(2) Termination of Contract Due to Illness</p>
<p>Chen Haoming asks: My friend, Ms. Xunhui, was engaged to a Mr. Feng at the age of seventeen (1940) through the arrangement of her parents. Now Mr. Feng is suffering from pulmonary disease due to hard work and has not recovered for a long time. For the sake of her lifelong happiness, Ms. Xunhui's parents came forward to negotiate with the other party to dissolve the engagement. The other party has been delaying on the pretext, and it has not been resolved for more than a year. According to the law, what is the proper way to resolve this?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] Article 975 of the Civil Code states that marriage may not be compelled. Article 976, paragraph 1, item 4 of the same law provides that if one of the parties to the marriage has a serious incurable disease, the other party may terminate the marriage contract. Since the other party has been ill for a long time and has not recovered, you can send him a letter expressing your decision to terminate the marriage. At the same time, you will not be bound by this marriage contract, but if the other party requests the return of the engagement dowry, it must be returned.</p>
<p>(3) Unauthorized Occupation of House</p>
<p>Duan Ruiying asks: (1) My husband's sister was married before 1924 (before the promulgation of the Inheritance Law). Does she have absolutely no right to inherit property? (2) Since my husband's father passed away (22 years ago), the property report shows that my husband (only son) is named. Now that my husband is working abroad, if his sister moves in and occupies the house without his consent, does this violate criminal law? Can I ask the court to stop it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) If the date of your father-in-law's death was before October 1926, then your husband's sister has no right to inherit the estate. (2) Your husband's sister's unauthorized occupation of the house is not in accordance with the law, but because she has a blood relationship with your husband, you should use your feelings to resolve it peacefully. Otherwise, you can sue in court.</p>
<h3>Second Round of Trachoma Prevention and Treatment to End Tomorrow</h3>

<p>Hope readers will tell emergency patients to apply in accordance with the regulations to speed up treatment</p>
<p>Entrusted by enthusiastic people in the community, this newspaper is sponsoring the emergency relief fund. The details and regulations were published in this column on the 10th, 13th, and 16th.

<h3>First Session of the First Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>— Fanshi</p>
<p>Starting from September 9th, for the past two weeks, it has not only been a concern for all Shanghai citizens, but also for people all over China and even the world.</p>
<p>Looking at the council from a global perspective, when democratic politics has become as common and familiar as everyday meals in Europe and the United States, China has just begun to create it. In addition to our shame and vigilance, we find this newborn baby particularly precious. Looking at the council from a historical perspective, after thousands of years of inheritance of autocratic thinking by emperors, China has finally smelled the breath of the people's century, and the people's will has been formally expressed for the first time by the people's organizations. This is the beginning of a new era. We breathe the fragrance of the new era and feel infinite excitement and encouragement!</p>
<p>The performance of the council in the past two weeks, as criticized by a foreign newspaper, has far exceeded the expectations of the general public. We saw the enthusiastic and tense atmosphere and the serious and sincere attitude in the conference hall. We also saw councillors criticizing government agencies and denouncing administrative malpractice without any scruples, and speaking freely. We have also seen the various problems related to the people's livelihood being frankly raised and thoroughly discussed. All of this shows a good spirit and a healthy start. We do not necessarily expect this council to achieve any significant results. Just this spirit alone is enough to represent its significance and indicate the brilliant prospects of China's democratic future.</p>

<h3>This Is Beautiful</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>On the journey of life spanning decades, pain and happiness are relative. Just as the arrogance of the scorching sun in midsummer is hateful, and the warm sunshine in winter, shining on the earth, is cherished; without experiencing the harsh winter, one cannot appreciate the preciousness of the bright spring, gentle breeze, and warm sunshine.</p>
<p>The appreciation and creation of art is to guide life into another ideal realm; to transform ferocity into harmony, to transform cruelty into love, to transform struggle into peace; to pursue the truth, not to be blinded by material desires, "Danqing does not know that old age is coming, wealth and honor are like floating clouds to me," this super-utilitarian thinking represents the essence of oriental philosophy.</p>
<p>The entire life history of an artist is like a lone boat sailing on the sea, encountering rushing waves, a biting north wind, and a lonely and bitterly cold night, relying on his personal adamantine belief and indomitable spirit, regardless of the current dark and dangerous objective environment, he wants to create and pursue the future of light. Michelangelo formed the statue of David in 1501, and its majestic and profound style is a rare masterpiece since ancient Greece; at the time, it was almost destroyed by the residents of Florence. The 19th-century writer Rodin, his masterpieces "The Thinker," "The Age of Bronze," and "The Burghers of Calais" were attacked and criticized, thus prompting him to create the immortal masterpieces "The Burghers of Calais" and "The Gates of Hell." These are all historical precedents. Not only artists, but also the achievements of scientists, religious figures, educators, and politicians, the performance of sacrificing one's life for righteousness, does not originate from the category of morality, but rather from the expression of the supreme beauty of human nature. Why did Confucius travel around the world without settling down; Prince Siddhartha, the prince of Jialuocheng in northern India, created the compassionate and empathetic Buddhism after six years of ascetic practice in the Himalayas; Wu Xun was a beggar from Tangyi County, Shandong. What rich knowledge and outstanding talent did he have that he was able to have a unique style in the history of Chinese education; President Lincoln, who liberated black slaves and sparked the American Civil War, unexpectedly was assassinated in 1865, why did Dr. Sun Yat-sen not avoid danger for forty years and create a revolutionary history of the Chinese nation's struggle?</p>
<p>Utilitarians, with their narrow-minded view of life that sits in a well and looks at the sky, destroy human nature and create a dark, tragic, and cruel history of blood and tears for mankind. People have long been tired of watching it. On the actual stage of life, let's continue to play the ugly dramas of greed, treachery, ferocity, and struggle, let's change our appetite and breathe the fresh and fragrant air of peace! Otherwise, the throne of "human beings are the spirit of all things" will fall into the dark abyss of "human beings are the spirit of all things."</p>
<h3>A Study of Shitao's Age and Place of Origin</h3>
<p>— Liang Lieya</p>
<p>I am most fond of appreciating the calligraphy and paintings of my hometown's sage, Shitao. After reading Mr. Wen Fatong's "The Monk Shitao" in this column, it aroused my interest in studying Shitao again. Therefore, my views on Shitao's place of origin and age are somewhat different from what Mr. Wen said; I am willing to discuss it with people who are interested in studying Shitao.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen once said, based on Zhang Pushan's "Supplement to the Collection of Paintings," "Yangzhou Painting Garden," and Qin Zuyong's "Tongyin Yu Painting," "What kind of person is the monk Shitao? From the above readings, we can find simple records of "descendants of the former Ming Chu Fan" and "descendants of the Sheng State Chu Fan."</p>
<p>That's right, this record is based on evidence, but I think this evidence is a little unreliable, because "Yangzhou Painting Garden" and "Tongyin Yu Painting" are based on Zhang Pushan's "Supplement to the Collection of Paintings," and Zhang Pushan did not know Shitao very well. After he completed "Collection of Paintings," he went to Yangzhou and saw the Yangzhou Eight Eccentrics often imitating Shitao's paintings, so he included Shitao in the "Supplement," but he still could not accurately recognize Shitao.</p>
<p>We don't have to indirectly search for other works to find out what kind of person Shitao is? It is very convenient to directly refer to the paintings painted by Shitao, and we can get a very accurate answer. Didn't Shitao ever use two seals, "Descendant of Jingjiang" and "Tenth Generation Grandson of Zan Zhi"? This is Shitao himself explaining that he is a "Descendant of Jingjiang" and "Tenth Generation Grandson of Zan Yi, son of Jingjiang King Shouqian," not "Descendants of Chu Fan."</p>
<p>The Jingjiang King's palace was built under the Duxiu Peak in Guilin City, Guangxi Province, so Shitao often called himself "Seng Yuanji from Yue Mountain" and "Yuexi Shitao Ji" in the inscriptions on his paintings. In addition, he also had a seal that said "Yue Mountain." This evidence is also Shitao himself explaining that he is from Yuexi. In addition, Chen Ding from Jiangyin, who had been to Qian, Dian, and Yue, also said in his "Leixi Waiji" that Shitao was from Guangxi. Zhang Xianghe from Huating wrote a book "Yuexi Bishu" when he was a feudal official in Guangxi in the 25th year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, which also included a biography of Shitao. As for Mr. Wen saying that Shitao "is also a descendant of the Ming Dynasty," that is also very correct, but Mr. Wen cannot clearly specify that Shitao is not a "descendant of Chu Fan" and say that "Shitao is a Guangxi native."</p>
<p>Mr. Wen said this about Shitao's age: "Although his birth and death dates cannot be determined for the time being, judging from the first sentence of his poem "In the winter snow of Xinwei, Mr. Zhang Ruzuo sees talented people and heroes, and the seat is full for a while. The Duke will travel to the capital in the future, and he will write a thank you and a gift", "Half my life has been spent in the old north and south window", that year was the fourth year of Chongzhen (1631), he should have been thirty or forty years old", but when we saw the orchids and bamboos co-created by Shitao and Wang Yuanqi in the collection of the Palace Museum, it was made in the 30th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty (Xinwei). If we use Mr. Wen's textual research as evidence, then Shitao should have been one hundred years old by Kangxi Xinwei. Also, Wang Yuanqi was born in the fifteenth year of Chongzhen. If that Xinwei year was from Chongzhen, then Yuanqi had not yet been born, so how could he cooperate with Shitao? Moreover, there is no evidence that Shitao lived to be ninety-one or one hundred years old.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen also said that the Renwu year in Shitao's "In the third month of the Renwu spring, under the Dadi Hall, the sea crabs and enchantments are flamboyant, playfully writing and releasing the Buddha's legacy" is also considered to be the Renwu year of Chongzhen fifteen, but according to Shitao's own long inscription on the painting of plum blossoms, "I have had a branch since Gengshen, for six years, far and near, and I have not produced it elsewhere", Shitao was only thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of Chongzhen fifteen and still lived in Gengxi. How could he get a branch in "Yangzhou"?</p>
<p>Shitao's age is inherently difficult to find, but according to his handwritten note asking Bada to draw a picture of Dadi Hall for him, it says: "People hear that you are over seventy years old, and you climb mountains as if you were flying, you are truly a god among immortals. Ji is sixty-four or five years old, and everything is unbearable. Seeing that the new paintings and calligraphy of those who come and go are all treasures that Ji cannot praise. Today, Li Song'an returns to Nanzhou, with an empty letter sent up. Ji wants to ask you, sir, to draw a scroll of the hall, with a few cedars on the flat slope, and nothing in the pavilion, which is Dadi Hall?", we know that Shitao himself said his age. But this handwritten note did not record the year. Fortunately, later Shitao wrote in the poem inscription on the picture of Dadi Hall that Bada painted for him, "At the time, the summer of the Wuyin year, the mountain monk Daji Ji of Qingxiang Chen Ren drafted it", according to this year's speculation, it was the 37th year of Kangxi, "Wuyin", when Bada was seventy-four years old and Shitao was about sixty-eight or nine years old, which proves that Shitao was just a two or three-year-old child in the third year of Chongzhen, and it cannot be said that he was a person of thirty or forty years old.</p>
<p>There are not many surviving paintings of Shitao that clearly state the year. We use his inscribed years to measure his age until what year, and use it to estimate his life span. If it is calculated for ten years, the latest year is Dinghai in the 46th year of Kangxi (1706). Shitao probably passed away in this year, and his life span was around seventy-eight years old.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Yingbao's Landscape Painting Preface</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>The way of painting rises and falls with the times. In the past two or three decades, the style of crude and bold daubing has reached its extreme and is already outdated. As the nation enters a time of great renewal, with the resurgence of great undertakings and the rise of talent, the artistic style in the art world inevitably trends toward refinement and magnificence. Therefore, today's painters, all those who do not act frivolously, not only uplift the spirit of the times but also possess admirable ambition and energy. When I was young, I followed my father to the old capital while he was in office. Our home had a considerable collection of ancient artifacts and paintings. I loved them, but my talent was not up to learning. I particularly envied my classmate Wang Yingbao for his thorough study of the Six Canons of painting. His natural talent was outstanding, his brushstrokes elegant, and the smoke, clouds, streams, and waterfalls he painted seemed to have moisture on the paper. The meticulous details in his mountain paintings resembled the style of Wang Wei, while his exquisite shading and rendering often reminded people of the artistic realms of Zhao Zhongmu and Wen Zhengming. He is truly a brilliant talent. Later, Yingbao studied in America, and his contributions were recognized by the imperial court. His talent and reputation were highly esteemed by contemporaries. Despite his early love for painting, he continued to persevere. Now, he is about to exhibit his works to enlighten the Shanghai audience, allowing them to appreciate his cultivation. Alas! Yingbao and I have been apart for nearly a decade. Searching through my dilapidated boxes, I hope to find some remnants of his work to compare with his current exquisite skills and to prove my theory of the rise and fall of art. I wish to discuss this with elder art experts.</p>
<h3>Peaks After Rain</h3>
<p>— Wang Yingbao</p>
<p>Tagore's Sayings</p>
<p>— Tian Rui</p>
<p>Thank the flame for its light, but do not forget the one who holds the lamp, for he stands steadfastly in the darkness!</p>
<p>Life is given to us; we can only obtain it by giving it away.</p>
<p>Trampling with feet can only raise dust from the ground, not reap a harvest.</p>
<p>The mission each child carries at birth is proof that God has not yet tired of humankind.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 39</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Leave?" He seemed to confirm that I was suggesting he leave Changxindian. "Where would I go? First, there's no money for travel. Although there's some ancestral property in my hometown, I've already sold it piecemeal to cover household expenses for the past few years. Go to Beiping? There's no way. Perhaps I could ask a friend in Dingxian who runs a model village if he could find me a job? If there's no job, how can my family of seven or eight survive on empty stomachs?"</p>
<p>He said seven or eight, probably including the fourth daughter in the budget, "Ju Jun," as well.</p>
<p>"Brother Dingyuan," I pondered for a moment and said solemnly, "I can think of a solution, whether to leave or not, but the decision is yours. Staying here, though there are ways, doesn't guarantee safety..."</p>
<p>"Then, do you think this war is definitely going to break out?" He impatiently changed the question.</p>
<p>"Judging from Chairman Chiang's declaration, there's a 50% chance of peace and a 50% chance of war. In other words, if the Japanese act recklessly and stubbornly, we won't even get the minimum peace terms, and we'll have no choice but to defend ourselves. From the Japanese perspective, there's a 100% chance of war. As for safety, of course, you should leave, and leave far away. Dingxian is only a few hours away by train, so leaving there is like not leaving at all... I think for complete safety, there are probably only four places: Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan... Jiangxi, Anhui, Guangxi, I can't guarantee."</p>
<p>"Why such a wide range...?" The engineer's eyes widened in shock at my words, but he dared not fully believe them. "Is there any basis for this?"</p>
<p>"Brother," I decided to be frank, "Since you're a close friend, I'll tell you the truth. There's a very good reason for what I say. Not to mention anything else, just look at the 'Tanaka Memorial,' the Japanese have long been preparing to dominate East Asia. Recently, according to the Japanese General Staff's operational plan, they plan to have several major convergences in China—one force will go along the Beijing-Suiyuan line, through Datong to Taiyuan, then down to Luoyang; another will go along the Pinghan Line, through Baoding southwards, converging at Zhengzhou; then they will divide their forces again, crossing the Yellow River, and the forces going south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will converge at Xuzhou; then they will converge at Wuhan, and then go east along the Yangtze River, and the main force landing in Shanghai will converge at Nanjing. If our government immediately moves south, they might even converge at Shaoguan... You can't say the Japanese are just dreaming. I remember a German military strategist saying that only five hundred German regular troops would be enough to trample all over China. Therefore, the Japanese expect to resolve the entire China issue in a very short period."</p>
<p>"Oh... so it's a matter of the entire nation's survival," he was touched by the concept of the nation. "Leave? That's not the answer... At most, we can let the children... the women... Strange, what's Song Zheyuan's opinion?" He lowered his head, as if discussing with himself.</p>
<p>Our conversation ended here. From his words, I could see his error. He probably thought the July 7th Incident was just a local issue. At the time, apart from a few clear-headed military and political figures, most people probably thought the same way as this engineer.</p>
<p>For several days, I was busy with work, waiting for news from Brother He, and didn't bother to ask about Engineer Dingyuan's affairs. He didn't come to see me again either. Brother He had safely arrived at the Panyang headquarters, but I hadn't received his special intelligence (regarding the progress of the seven secret letters). The only thing that made me feel slightly excited was that Mr. W had conveyed two good news, mentioning that both Mr. Fan and Mr. Xiao were making good progress.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 25th, I suddenly received an urgent telegram from Brother He. After careful consideration, I conveyed the entire content to Mr. W's station in secret, and suggested that he quickly decide on the action plan and notify them promptly. In less than half an hour, a reply came, stating that Mr. W himself would be responsible for conveying the message to Zhang Zizhong and Qin Dechun, and then Zhang and Qin would present it to Song Zheyuan. At the same time, I would go to see Wang Lengqi in person. Mr. W had already introduced Mr. Wang by phone.</p>
<p>What exactly was going on? Now that time has passed, bringing it up again, on the one hand, can confirm that the Japanese have always acted in the same way as reckless bankrupts: insidious, rogue-like, brutal, and cunning. On the other hand, it can also be said to be a joke, an odd story. Ever since July 7th, all the magic tricks the Japanese had played had been exposed by us, responding to their words with words, and blocking their force with force, never letting them achieve their goals, so they were furious. This time, the General Staff decided to launch a "three-step march:" the first step in preparation; to kidnap important figures in the North China region, to carry out what they called "abduction and guidance."</p>

<h3>Letter from the Youth League</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from the Three Principles of the People Youth League. The letter began with: "Do you remember that you once suggested to us that we build a children's park on the grounds of our league headquarters? Now we have decided to first try to run a nursery to answer the earnest expectations of you and the society..."</p>
<p>When I read this, I was very moved. The Youth League is a vibrant organization, using vernacular Chinese in its official letter and connecting it to past events, which is enough to prove that the person in charge has insight and planning. But when I read further:</p>
<p>"Now we send you a copy of the charter of the establishment, please publish it in your newspaper, if you could raise your voice and introduce it widely, we would be extremely grateful;..."</p>
<p>That set of official formalities appeared again.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I still sincerely admire the spirit of the staff of the Shanghai branch of the Youth League. The Bible says: "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much." They have the courage to move forward, not neglecting details (a small suggestion I made a month ago), all of which proves their hard work and progress.</p>
<p>People outside the Kuomintang often have such a consistent criticism, and so do comrades within the party. They believe that the doctrine is good, but the comrades lack effort. At this year's National Congress of the Youth League in Guling, the President placed special hopes on the Youth League. If the cadres of the National Youth League can seize the opportunity, actively struggle, and show vitality, heroism, revolution, and vigor, it will not only inject new blood into the Kuomintang, but also be a great contribution to the nation.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the Shanghai branch is therefore particularly important in this situation.</p>

<h3>The Art of Deception</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Photographs have always been regarded as irrefutable "real evidence." However, some people can also use the skill of changing faces to forge photographs, making it difficult for people to distinguish between true and false.</p>
<p>Here are some photographic tricks.</p>
<p>Today, thousands of schools across the United States still hang a portrait of President Lincoln standing at an angle (Figure Two, right). Who would suspect that the Lincoln in this photo is not purely Lincoln himself? After seeing the picture on the left, you will suddenly realize that the photographer has played a trick of grafting. Because there are very few photos of Lincoln leaning, someone came up with a clever plan to "cut" off the head of John Coltin (the person in the picture on the left) and draw Lincoln's head on his shoulders, thus creating such a seamless Lincoln image.</p>
<p>The photo of Hollywood star Errol Flynn was also "cosmetically altered" by the student union of Princeton University - his two small mustaches were "shaved" off, and a pile of sailor-style hair was added - turning him into a "1940 standard Princeton student."</p>
<p>"Figure One" is a prank played by the American magazine Time: the collapsed building in the picture is the capital of Wisconsin. Who would not believe that it had collapsed after seeing this photo? Therefore, after this photo was published, citizens flocked to the Time magazine office to inquire about the truth, and telegrams kept coming. But these naive readers were too focused on the photo itself and ignored the small caption outside the picture - "April Fool's Day."</p>
<p>Figure Two: Lincoln's head was moved. (See "The Art of Deception" for details)</p>
<p>Figure Three: Fake childhood Hitler</p>
<p>Most readers must have seen the photo on the left of Figure Three and will not forget the title: "Hitler in his childhood."</p>
<p>To be honest, the hateful child in that photo is indeed not Hitler in his childhood. It is just a propaganda item satirizing Hitler, or rather, the masterpiece of an Austrian who hated this scourge in 1933. He modified a child from Westport, Connecticut, in the United States, shown in the picture on the right, into the hideous and hateful young "Hitler" in the picture on the left. After he modified it, he spread it internationally. At the time, Hitler was greatly annoyed by this matter, and it almost led to a diplomatic dispute between the United States and Germany.</p>
<p>As for who this Austrian was, no one knows.</p>
<h3>Old Tune</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>A Western proverb says, "He who is proud of his fine clothes is a fool." I believe that it is human nature to love beauty, and good-looking clothes can make oneself feel comfortable and others happy. But when you have a newly made garment, you must know that having beautiful clothes is only one-third of your beauty; another third is health, and the last third is knowledge. If you have all three, you are a truly beautiful person. Conversely, if you are a sick person, if you have no knowledge, then gorgeous clothes are nothing more than a mockery of yourself; they not only make you ashamed but also make you unpleasant to others.</p>
<h3>Self-Esteem · Self-Abasement</h3>
<p>— Yi Fu</p>
<p>There are two sentences in the fate of China: "Self-esteem is not arrogance, and self-effacement is not self-abasement." Indeed, self-esteem is the admiration and cherishing of one's own personality, while arrogance is an exaggerated exaggeration. Self-effacement is a polite expression of respect for others, while self-abasement is contempt and destruction of oneself. I remember that Lu Qingxian said, "A person should not be arrogant, but one cannot be without pride; arrogance will make people hate you, but pride will make you not humble yourself in dirty things, not perfunctory, and your character will be upright." Having arrogance is self-aggrandizement, having pride is self-esteem, not having arrogance is self-effacement, and not having pride is self-abasement. This is really thorough.</p>

<h3>The recently deceased Father Jacquinot - Mother of Chinese Refugees</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>When the "August 13th" war broke out, after three months of fierce fighting, our army made a strategic retreat. Two hundred thousand refugees in Nanshi, caught off guard, did not have time to escape and gathered in one corner, waiting to die. The frenzied Japanese army rushed into Nanshi, intending to commit atrocities against the refugees, when suddenly a white-haired, long-bearded Westerner walked out of the shrinking crowd, dressed in a priest's attire, and stopped the Japanese soldiers who were raising their bayonets. His eyes were full of compassionate and fearless light, which drove that group of "werewolves" to hesitate and dare not act.</p>
<p>This old priest was Father Jacquinot de Besange. He demonstrated the lofty religious spirit with his actions of practicing his faith.</p>
<p>In November of the twenty-seventh year, when the Japanese army entered Wuhan, Father Jacquinot once again stepped forward and created the same moving miracle.</p>
<p>Skilled at speaking</p>
<p>Father Jacquinot, a Frenchman, was born in 1878. Before coming to China, he studied literature in England and stayed there for a long time. At this time, he had already joined the "Society of Jesus," the most powerful international organization of the Catholic Church, as a member. In 1913, he came to Shanghai, China, to preach and taught at Xuhui College, Aurora University, and other schools. He was fluent in English, French, Chinese, Greek, and Latin, and was skilled at speaking. Every gesture and every word had a moving charm.</p>
<p>He once spoke publicly to Aurora students: "People who engage in social work should have more interactions, activities, more friends, and study psychology, because society is a group of people, and to serve in it, one must thoroughly understand it, otherwise, the career will have no hope of success." Therefore, he had many friends, from all countries including China, Japan, Europe, and the United States.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic helper</p>
<p>In addition to personally negotiating with the Japanese army during the war and establishing two "refugee zones" in Shanghai Nanshi and Hankou urban areas, he participated in many charitable causes in China. In the past, he served as a "committee member of the Greater Shanghai Social Relief Committee" and "vice-chairman of the Anti-Foreign Famine Relief Association."</p>
<p>Before taking office, he paid a visit to President Chiang and his wife, and had a meal and fruit. Madam Chiang personally peeled the fruit for him because Father Jacquinot's right hand was disabled, leaving only his left hand. Regarding the loss of his right hand, some say that it was because he participated in the First World War and sacrificed himself for the country, while others have other legends. In fact, his right hand was disabled by accident. When he was teaching at Xuhui College and serving as a disciplinarian, on the day of the school anniversary, he saw students making firecrackers in the playground, preparing to set off fireworks to celebrate. Because the students did not have enough strength, he stepped forward to personally fill the firecracker. Unexpectedly, he used too much force, and the medicine in the tube exploded, and his right hand was destroyed.</p>
<p>Heaven did not grant him a long life</p>
<p>In the twenty-ninth year, he went to the United States to raise 700,000 US dollars for Chinese refugees and gave them to China for relief. April 29th was Father Jacquinot's birthday. The refugees in Nanshi took advantage of his stay in Shanghai to hold a warm birthday celebration. As soon as he passed by, people along the way shouted "Living Buddha," and Mr. Jacquinot was moved to tears.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, he was appointed by the Holy See as a representative to Berlin. On the 10th of this month, he suddenly died of malignant anemia. When the bad news came, the citizens of Shanghai mourned him endlessly!</p>
