<p>馬歇爾</p>
<p>司徒雷登</p>
<h3>馬帥司徒聯合聲明闡述時局癓結所在　政府與中共難獲致協議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕馬歇爾特使，今長十時半邀約司徒大使暨周恩來，在其行館進行會談，仍就各基本問題交換意見。周恩來並表示對蔣主席提出之意見，拒絕接受。將主席之意見，據聞即係希望共軍必須在蘇北·熱河·膠濟路·山西·東北五處撤兵，並退出其地方行政權。周恩來旋於十二時半返梅園新村，司徒大使即留行館，與馬帥共進午餐，並即決定下午發表一書面聲明，下午五時一刻兪大維曾往訪馬帥，談一小時，至六時一刻辭出。又聞司徒大使下週仍將作北平之行，料理燕大校務。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十日電〕聞馬歇爾患病，定明日由京來此。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕美國新聞處十日下午發表美國駐華特使馬歇爾，及駐華大使司徒雷登對我國目前局勢之聲明如次：「馬歇爾將軍與司徒雷登博士，迄在共同研討各種可能之方法，以終止中國目前日益滋蔓之衝突，並着手開始發展一眞正民主式政府之初步步驟，蓋以和平方式解決一切政治問題，實際上顯爲全中國人民一致之願望，就經濟局勢而言，如欲避免不幸之崩潰，必須立謀政局之解決，現戰爭範圍日益擴大，幾有使全國捲入戰禍而致負責者不能控制之慮，政府與共產黨雙方領袖，均渴望終止戰爭，但有若干立待解決之問題，迄難獲致協義，雙方對于此等問題，似難獲致解決之方法，而俾發布一全國各地完全停止衝突之命令。在此等未解決之問題中，有係關於軍隊之重新部署者，但尙有更基本之問題，即在軍隊重新部署以後，國民大會未作根本決定之前，此等已經撤軍地區之地方政府，究應爲何種性質，實較軍隊之重新部署問題更難解決」。</p>
<p>整軍及駐區等問題　共黨迄無誠意表示　　（中央社南京十日電）馬帥及司徒大使發表聲明後，記者走訪某觀察家，叩詢意見。據談稱：該談話係馬帥司徒大使說明時局概況，及其月來奔走磋商之結果，使一般人曉然於時局癓結所在，吾人對於兩位之辛勞與盛意，不勝欽佩，其最後一段，所述整軍與駐軍地點之困難，以及中共要求將來在若干地方撤軍後，保留中共民政機稱，問題確屬重要，共方之要求，從表面看來，似亦勉强成理，但仔細分析，則其爲無誠意，爲完全注重宣傳作用，賓屬顯然，蓋在歐美，中央政府由某一黨執政，而地方政府有反對黨之省長市長，實司空見慣，法國在戰前右派執政時，亦常有若干都市共黨當選長，並不發生重大窒碍，蓋此等反對黨之地方長官仍須奉行國家法令，並不能任意作何重大改變，但中共則不然，其政權所到之處，即驅逐殘殺當地商人地主及知識份子，廢除一切國家法令，扣留一切稅收，擅自發行貨幣自立軍隊，究全另成一個國家，並完全作一政洽與社會之革命，此種地方政府，如到處成立，則中國將有無數獨立國家，與中央政府完全立於敵對地位此豈和平統一之道，如此，又何必商談和平乎？故此點吾人不能不表而出之，以促中外人士之注意也云云。</p>
<p>一局變棋無路可走　南京瀰漫悲觀預感</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕今日下午，馬帥暨司徒大使之聲明發表後，國面亦不願作何表示。據聞：周恩來曾稱：目前之局勢，將較此項聲明更爲嚴重。據其外籍權威人士稱，國共之談判，宛如變棋，全盤棋子均已吃盡，僅各餘砲與將帥一顆，此棋局雖未成死局，然亦已無路可走。又據接近政府某氏稱：吾人對司馬兩氏爲我和平奔走之辛勞努力，實深表感謝，吾人且盼兩氏萬勿氣餒，然吾人將仍以自力更生，力求和平之實現也。按今日適爲抗戰勝利之周年日，去年此時，在抗戰之陪都，正爆發不可抑制之狂歡，今年此日，竟爲和平談判宣告停頓，而在紫金城彌漫無限悲觀之預感，此豈不祥之兆　？</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕馬歡爾特使及司徒驚登大使發表共同聲明後，此間甚多觀察家為爲馬使已發現其所負使命無完成可能。惟馬使行館迄未傳出任何消息，足以指出馬使將放棄其所從事之艱鉅工作。一般人認爲馬使現已深信，照目前雙方談判情形，殆終不能使和平獲得實現。共同聲明究將引起何種後果，現尙無從獲悉。</p>
<h3>主席重要文告　十四日發表　彭部長昨日在滬宣佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中宣部長彭學沛，昨（十日）在招待本市新聞界之鷄尾酒會上宣佈；蔣主席將於八月十四日發表重要文告。彭部長甫於九日抵達上海，即於「勝利前夕」（日本宣佈投降一週年）之昨日午後五時，假華懋飯店八樓舉行鷄尾酒會，招待新聞界負責人，藉資聯歡。到有本市中外各報社各通訊社社長，總編輯，駐滬各大使館新聞處處長及聯總行總等機關新聞分佈主持人，共約一百五十餘人。賓主週旋於此高樓之上，持杯暢談甚歡。上述重要消息，即係彭氏在酒會中發表者。首用中語，繼用英語。渠稱：主席已定十四日發表重要文告，内容大致爲（一）回頭勝利後一年來政府施政經過，（二）目前時局情况，（三）財政經濟政策。彭部長繼稱：「我財政狀况現已漸趨好轉，七月份鈔票發行額並無增加，爲戰事以後第一次。現稅收日有進步，而近月來敵偽產業標賣，每月有三百億元收入國庫，中紡公司亦月有凈利一百億元繳入國庫。」彭部長曾視察江西，湖南，四川，各省俱有大豐收之象，故彭部長結論謂：「各地今後糧價勢將下跌，生產成本因此亦可望减低，唯目前最大困難，仍在於燃煤不豐，經濟財政雖形好轉，然因山東等地煤礦仍在共黨手中，故不能獲解決。目前上海需燃媒五十萬噸，端賴開　煤礦每月供給十四萬噸，台灣運來六萬噸，不敷仍鉅，唯望共黨能解除封鎖，則我財政經濟狀况更可好轉。」六時許，中外佳賓即絡續向彭部長握手道別，並對招待盛意表示感謝。</p>

<h3>對外交通不逾百里　太原已成為孤城　保定外圍共軍增兵布防</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十日電〕太原已成孤城，對外交通幾難逾百里，東僅達六十里之榆次，西達五十里之晋　，北達六十九里之黄寨，南里，介休，現僅賴中航機維持至平交通，正太綫戰事仍烈，鐵路遭共軍破壞極重。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十日電〕保定外圍共軍增兵，其一區司令　印堂已率部在滿城西南布防，卅一旅長前寧所部由勝芳開抵高陽西北構築工事，涿縣九日發生戰事，境内花園小部村遭共軍楊成武部千餘猛攻，正激戰中。</p>
<h3>蘇北各綫共軍潰退　國軍越東臺北進　淮陰共軍老巢已呈動搖</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕蘇北右翼國軍，於本月五日自海安越王家莊進入富安後，次日乘勢沿公路以每小時十里之速度，突破安豐梁垜三灶等地之要隘，攻入東台南門，另部進佔車台以西二華里之西溪，共軍開始向北潰退，國軍現正分二路北上，一部沿公路指向監城，一部沿蚌蜓河西進，與大垜老閣之國軍會師，逐步肅淸東台以西之共軍，然後合兵直奔臨澤，進取汜水，切斷淮仙公路及運河道，使界首高郵邵伯共軍，陷於孤立，國軍是項戰略，意在避免與共軍主力，作正面接觸，故仙女廟國軍，按兵不動，靜待泰縣國軍迂迴北上，由三郎廟向西，包抄共軍後路，然後一舉消滅汜水以南之共軍。</p>
<p>徐州國軍北路已抵韓莊，正向沙溝疾進中，東路仍控制八義集，由徐東開火車，已可通達大許家車站，雙溝國軍，遭共軍連日猛攻，迄未稍動，不老河北岸共軍萬餘人，刻於東幅山一帶集結，有進犯模樣，台兒莊以西地區，戰况遽烈，雙方傷亡慘重，傳共軍臨沂軍區總指揮羅榮恒，保安司令馬占榮，副司令鄭庭鈞等，均已先後抵達車幅山附近，準備發動大規模之攻勢。永城國軍已將進犯之共軍擊退，碭山國軍仍未脫離險境，豐縣，單縣，夏邑，唐寨共軍，在不斷擴增中，黄口車站以西地區，已有劇戰發生。共軍此次發動攻勢，顯　得不償失，淮陰共軍老巢，已呈動搖現象。傳蘇皖邊區政府，刻已撤往淮陰，而張集華中銀行，已遷至淮安鹽集，賓應城内共黨機關，亦已移至大官莊，故蘇北共軍之被肅淸，僅爲時間問題。</p>

<p>〔聯合社天津十日電〕今日獲悉：天津聯總及行總農業專家狄郁，入日晨偕翻譯吳約翰乘聯總吉普車於平津道上遭人狙擊，出事地點離天津約三十里，先有便衣華人一名開槍，繼有衣藍灰色共軍軍裝者約四十人，自麥田內衝出，分立道旁，一齊開槍。狄氏所乘車雖命中多處，惟二人幸並未受傷，狄氏及其翻譯係自熱河共軍區內歸來，在熱時曾與共方領袖討論復興熱河農業間題。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕負寶調查安平事件的廿五小組，今天又在一陣吵吵閙鬧中開會散會，會議於上午九時在協和醫院的K31號房間開始，已經來平三四天，等候向軍調部報告的海軍陸戰隊代表，仍然準時到達，佇立室外甬道中，主席戴維斯舊話重提，提議聽取陸戰隊的報告，共產黨代表黄逸峯也一如往昔，堅決反對這個提議。當會議進行時，戴維斯傷心的說，六天很容易的過去了，我們只作了很少的一部份應當作的工作，現在三委員也很想知道我們究竟，作了甚麼，我們最好追考六天來究竟作了些甚麼，給他們一個報告。現在我作了這樣一個報告，如果你們同意，也可以簽字在這上面，作爲共同的報告，若不同意，也可以單獨作報告，黄逸峯一面同意這個提議，另方面又作了補充說明，自這時候起，便波濤汹湧，把討論主題扯到發言程序和發言權，吵鬧不休，十點鐘時，氣憤的載維斯上校拉了公事包鋉，宣布散會，下午軍調部三委員開會，才打破了這個僵局，命令小組十一日再開會，但是小組何時出發調查，小組人員也感覺茫然。</p>

<h3>鄂共軍紛紛投誠　已由地方政府儘量收容</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十日電〕據軍方今晨二時發表：共軍正規部　及地方武力，其黨政工作人員之携械投誠者，日有增加，綜計自李先念部開始西竄，至七月底止，其所部官兵之向安陸應山等九縣，紛紛投誠者，平均每縣在千人以上，槍在二百以上，均由各地方政府儘量收容中。</p>
<h3>中共繼續宣傳反美　希望國際干涉中國　美軍事援華法案擱置中</h3>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕北平行營爲護衛平津公路安全，派隊沿路駐守後，中共即大事宣傳國軍進攻「冀東解放區」，甚至謂美軍不斷增援國軍，，企圖轉移目光，掩飾安平事件。又延安解放日報本月五日社論，謂美國軍隊繼續駐華，原以協助中國撤退日俘為口實，此種口實現已不復存在，此際美軍倘再不撤，則將形同麥克阿瑟元帥麾下之駐日「佔領軍」矣。中共之宣傳，顯欲以「佔領軍」字樣，激起無知農民之反感，可以爲擴大反美運動作伏筆。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕近來有國際干涉論關若隱若現在傳播，一般人被未知其來源。自中共發言人王炳南七日晚發表談話後，衆始恍然。王之談話要旨，除誇大目前局勢嚴重外，謂中共認為義英蘿三大國應根據莫斯科公報，「保證中國之和平與民主政治」。在道義上負責注視美國忠實履行公報內之條款。目前事態已屬對美國將否依照莫斯科與華盛頓所定之原則而進行調處之最後試騐云云。可見王炳南代表中共，希望蘇英出場來千涉中國問題。</p>
<p>〔本報特派員華盛頓九日電〕某中國記者會於日前晤及美衆議員楚德。據告：目前中國「內戰」，已使軍事援華派遣軍事代表團赴華之法案遭受相當「挫折」，幷謂，倘中國確有改組政府及實行統編國軍及共軍之可能，則該法案無疑可獲通過，但目前則機會消逝矣。楚德又謂：該法案未明白規定係於中國改組政府成立以前或以後界予對華軍事援助，字句有欠明晰，以致平素對中國極友好之　員，對該法案亦表示冷淡。現該法案在國會休會前，擱置於衆議院法制委員會中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十日電〕北平中共發言人今晚發表强力聲明，要求美國政府撤回一切過去移交中國政府之租借法案飛機，零件及軍火，發言人稱：南京中共代表團已請馬歇爾元帥將此次抗　書轉達美國政府。</p>

<h3>蘆台以北地雷爆炸　北寗路煤車出軌　守衛美軍事後並遭射擊</h3>

<p>〔聯合社北平十日電〕此間觀察家認爲，在蘆台附近向列車開槍者必爲共軍無疑。安平事件發生後。政府高級官員即曾警告美方，留心華北美軍再受共軍襲擊，據稱：安平事件及以前兵士被據一案，爲共軍有計劃之運動，目的在强迫美軍撤離中國，此項運動，方在開始。</p>
<h3>越南法軍連續暴行　我提出嚴重抗議　日警槍殺台胞案已採緊急措施</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕記者頃以越南發生法軍慘殺我國僑胞事實眞象詢問外交部發言人，據稱：據西貢總領館報告，越南南圻檳知省，新香市，於七月廿一日有法軍六七十人，砲轟市區，旋開入市區，逐戶搜查，僑胞廿一人，被毆傷三人，失踪五人，全市各處，被焚毁，僑胞財產損失，難以估計，我駐西貢總領館，已向法國駐越南高級專員，提出嚴重抗議，要求懲罰兇手，並賠償損失，此外並要求保證今後不再有類此事件之發生。又上月十日晚九時法軍百餘人，於距西貢六公里之官壽村，包圍店戶，驅逐居民並縱火焚居，華僑皮革廠等十三家被焚，華僑四十三人被拘，次日釋出，華僑婦女一人，竟已被戕重傷，十三日晨九時三刻，法軍又至該村，任意開槍，當有行人三人被擊斃，其中二人爲華僑，中國政府對法軍此種暴行，甚爲駭異，特向法大使館，提出嚴重抗議，並請求法大使迅電越南法當局制止此種行爲，追究責任，嚴懲肇事兇犯，我政府並要求保留索取生命財產賠償之櫂利。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕外交部情報司長何鳳山，本日中午舉行記者招待會，對東京日警槍殺我台胞案之眞相，有所說明。何氏首先報告遷谷事件經過（從略），繼稱：本部據報後，即令駐日代表團迅速採取下列各點之緊急措施：（一）應由該代表團即與盟軍總部聯合舉行調查，俾明瞭事態真相；（二）事件一待查明呈報後，我方之要求即行提出；（三）採取適當方洗，防止事態之漫延擴大，保護僑胞之安全；（四）請盟軍總部指示日本政府及輿論界不可故意渲染或作煽動性之宣傳，現此案尙在我方積極交涉中，至前傳台僑曾承認對日警開槍一節，係出於美憲兵司令部日本二次翻譯之錯誤，已經美方更正矣。</p>

<p>上海市商會和全國工業協會，因爲工商業當前危機嚴重，擬具挽救方案，推派代表，八日晚晋京請願。各業中痛苦特深的，又加派代表，隨同前往。聞南京，鎭江，杭州，無錫等地商會，以同病相憐，也聞風饗應。這種舉動，顯然表示工商界已在喊救命了，實在具有很深刻的意義。這兩天，他們在首都請願的結果，雖還不知道將來有多少收穫，不過我們總以爲此次請願，應該只許成功，不可失敗；並且宋院長前天在滬，也接見上海工商金融界的領袖，傾聽他們的陳述，我們當可相信政府也不會使工商界此次的請願失敗的。</p>
<p>現在我們願站在報人地位，向政府和工商界說幾句話。首須指明的，是工商業的危機，目前已經到臨，並不是預測。只要看看各業實銷的淸淡，和停廠關店的層出不窮，便是鐵一般的事實。而且這種情形，也不限於上海一市。此中原因，自然很多，這裏也不必細說。但是官樣衙門的金融機構不能與生產事業相配合，買辦思想的外匯和貿易政策不能安定民族經濟，這兩點實爲最重要的主因。</p>
<p>我們知道：四聯總處，中央銀行，中國銀行，交通銀行，農民銀行等等，他們的成績，都很不差。但是他們的成績，只是他們自身的成績，只是他們營業盈餘的成績，並不是一般工商業的成績，更不是國民經濟發展的成績。所謂扶助工商，發展生產等，是否能確實盡其使命，在外界還不能無疑。例如貸欵政策，近來務從緊縮，業務手續，格外趨向繁複，這在顧全本身的安穏上着想，自然無可非議，若說到調劑金融，扶助生產等任務，曾否充分發揮，令人滿意這一層，似乎還是另一問題了。</p>
<p>拿工業貸款來說：經過各方面的敦促，已經舉辦的貸款，似乎確也不少。但其總數，據聞還不到歲出總額百分之二。拿民營銀行來說：祇聽到「加收準備金」，「限制放欵」等聲浪，其於助長金融市塲的靈活，有沒有積極的辦法，事實具在，似乎不必我們再來饒舌。</p>
<p>對美匯價，早已規定了。比照戰前，約高六七百倍。但國內物價指數，已上漲至四五千倍了。至美國物價，縱使按照黑市來計算，亦不過上漲三四倍。這種辦法是不是在那裏妨礙出口，引誘進口？主要出口貨如絲·茶·桐油等，至今還不能抬頭。進口貨方面，奢侈品和必需品，又一律予以結匯。必需品中，如機器之類，甚至以三個月匯票不够應付，反受了打撃，不能定貨。結果是所有外匯基金，大量流爲奢侈品及外國的剩餘物品抵作頭寸。</p>
<p>我們也知道：進口貨中，原定有若干種，須另征百分之五十的奢侈稅，而且若干種禁止進口。無奈百分之五十的額外加征，在事實上，並不能影響到外國出口商的利潤，而所謂禁止進口貨又不過寥寥二十餘種。除此二十餘種外，目前中國所不必要，尤其戰後的中國所不應要的東西，似乎還很多很多。倘使國際貿易，仍認爲國際借貸的最後壁壘，並且是認國內經濟能力薄弱，不能爲洋貨的尾閭，那麼，這種辦法是否合理，似乎還可商討。</p>
<p>以上兩項政策（金融政策和外匯及貿易政策），很明顯地還有錯誤。須知只重鈔票，而不顧到整個的經濟，因而對於生產事業的放欵，務從緊縮，這實在是一偏的見解。至於外匯與國際貿易，又以外匯放長，惟恐鈔票支付增加，而洋貨廉價進口，反認爲加價轉售，可以促進法幣的回籠，這種市儈式的論據，是否健全，我們也認爲有重行檢討的必要。因爲金融愈緊，生產必愈弱，洋貨愈多，經濟必愈窘。天下寗有可以自己不事生產，而專靠洋貨來供給一輩子的國家？</p>
<p>其次，我們對於工商界，也不能不望他們急起自救。目前工商業的危機太多，除掉上述這幾種外，餘如地方秩序問題，交通問題，動力問題等等，這都不是自力所能解决的事情。至如生產設備應如何調整，勞資糾紛應如何减輕，乃至改良管理，推廣銷路等，業中人無可推託，至少應負大部份的責任。所以我們的見解，認爲機器落伍，出品不良，和製品成本高於一般水準的，不妨從嚴取締，勿再任其浪費財力及資源。至於生產條件較爲優越，堪以支持的，便當與金融機構，謀取切實聯絡，本着刻苦耐勞的精神，積極地從事生產。凡勞工技能太差的，應當設法提高；失業工人的救濟，應當由國家來負責，不能把工廠的生產事業看作慈善救濟事業，然後業中人能集中其勞動酬報於在勤的工人。照此辦理，工業界或尙不無一綫生機。至於商業界，年來以畸形發展，未能與工業生產品及用戶購買力相配合，除應調劑金融，以免全盤受其打擊外，似也應該大澈大悟，同業之間酌量歸併，以節省勞費。</p>
<p>最後，我們不能忘却占全國人口百分之八十以上的農民。他們是原料的供給者，也是製品的消費者。所以復興農村，增加他們的經濟能力，實是最根本的要圖。目前中國農民銀行雖很努力，但在一般農民看來，終不無杯水車薪之感。加上放款期限太短，洋貨的引誘力太大，美棉的大量進口，和洋麥的大宗傾銷，尤冷却了農民植棉種麥的自信心。病源所在，還是由於當局眼光太近，算盤太小，金融政策和外匯及貿易政策的把舵不盡得當。</p>
<p>情勢眞急了！國民經濟的危機一天一天的顯著了！工商界已到了「人窮則呼天」的時候，大家迫着向政府喊救命了！如果我們還只知循着「買辦政策」的老路錢，爲傾銷洋貨收回鈔票打算盤，恐怕終有一天「民窮財盡」，政府又那裏能够穩固？現在倘不趕快「亡羊補牢」，將來勢必「噬臍無及」！</p>

<h3>對義和約苛刻過甚　義國總理表示不滿　和會席上前敵國代表首次發言　盼所受犧牲能獲若干報償</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十日緊急廣播：歐洲和會今日下午三時十分（上海時間午夜）開會時，義大利總理加斯貝利曾發表演辭。謂義大利茲以戰敗國之資格來此參加和會，並謂對義和約甚感苛刻，此次會議如眞爲復興及國際合作之工具，則義人所受之犧牲至少可在此獲得若干之報償。根據舊金山聯合國憲章第二條之規定，在國際關係上，一致同意排斥武力，同時爲適合主權平等原則計，各國應相互保證「領土完整及政治獨立」。義大利爲其法西斯之過去，業已受到懲處，各民族此後似應恢復其國際合作之新精神，但和約内之苛刻規定，實使余不得不有所申首者。苟就我人之防禦能力而言，則我人之獨立甚至將瀕朝不保夕之險境，在我國之近代史上，門戶之洞開，未有如此次之甚者，而我人之防禦能力亦從未受過如此苛刻之限制者。加斯貝利末謂：請毋忘一九四五年八月二日之波茨坦協定。義大利乃第一與德國斷絕關係之軸心國家，對納粹之崩潰，在盟國方面，實有具體之貢獻在也，我人首先加入盟方，對日宣戰，我人自動自法西斯政權中解放，而走向民主政制之進步大道，凡此皆係波茨坦會議所承認者。然觀乎此次對義和約草案，則又如何？義大利民族似已在歷史舞台上失其踪跡矣云云。</p>

<h3>連任和會主席的皮杜爾從地下工作到總統</h3>
<p>喬治·皮杜爾，法國臨時政府的總統兼外長，一向來都是個善於調停的人。在一個滿是老頭子政治家的國度裏，四十六歲的皮杜爾能够一躍而爲全國的領袖，就是靠了他這種能調和各方的本領。在倫陷時期，他調協各抗敵的地下力量，使他們能會合到一起。勝利以後，他這種責任是更重大了，因爲在國際方面，皮杜爾認爲法國必須作英美加蘇聯之間的調人，使他們能融和相處，否則，法國必將在這兩方的火併下犧牲。在國內方面，他的政策是要使內閣中許多不同的黨派和份子集中注意在國家迫切的需要上，通常，他的辦法是使他們看出，國内的衝突將如何影饗到法國在國際上的地位。他的内閣正出生於國際間錯綜複雜的多事之秋，而又負着制定將來法國憲法的使命，所以皮杜爾的資任，可說是比法國歷史上任何內閣總理的所担負的更爲重大。</p>
<p>皮杜爾身材短小，外貌安寗而内心極多衝動，但他有極堅强的體力和勇氣，這是他最大的特徽之一。就因爲如此，他有時會奮然不顧一切，甚至不經任何考慮而貿然行事。但又有時候，他極富彈性，能蜿轉避開難於克服的阻碍，而另取別路，這是他任戴高樂政府的外長時，我們所常常見到他如此做的。</p>
<p>一九一八年，第一次歐戰正將結束時，皮杜爾被召服役。戰爭結束以後，皮杜爾決心進入敎育界，在伐萊辛學院敎書，在那時候，他也開始對社會運動發生興趣，並祖任了一家報紙的主編。這張報紙本來沒沒無名，少人注意，但因了他所寫社論的堅强有力，銷路立刻大增。他在一九三六年時撰文支持萊翁勃朗的人民陣綫政府；在西班牙問題上，他同情左翼；而其戰前最重要的一篇社論，則是對慕尼黑協定的抨擊。</p>
<p>一九三九年，這次的大戰爆發，皮杜爾立即參加了軍隊。一九四〇年五月，他所屬的一師爲德軍所圍，自已被捕，被關進了集中營。一年後他總算被放了出來。出來以後，他立即設法和法國的地下工作份子發生了關係。他要救出那些還在集中營中的同志們，他要把法國從鐵練枷鎖中解放出來。他不像別的愛國者那樣遠走他國，而是一直留在法境，組織起各種不同的地下抗敵力量，向德國人鬥爭。他白天在大學教書，晚上和同志們商討策略，籌劃佈置。他的人格和聲譽是他最好的保障，他從不化裝穩避，而只是安然無事地自來自往。沒有一個人疑心，這個坦然自若的年青人會是一個負着如此沈重使命的人物。</p>
<p>戰爭勝利以後，載高樂將軍回到了巴黎。皮杜爾，因為他與各方都能交好，左派，右派，中產階級，工人，他和他們都能合得來，並使他們互相協調，所以結果，皮杜爾出任了戴高樂内閣的外長。後來戴高樂去職，繼任的總統古恩又與他政見相左，皮杜爾，靠了左右兩派共同擁護，竟一躍而成了法國歷史上最年青的總統。</p>
<p>皮杜爾是到去年才結婚的，這位新總統夫人，久在外交界任事，是皮杜爾地下工作時代的忠實同志，對於法國的解放，有着極大的貢獻。目前，她是皮杜爾最有力的顧問和助手。</p>

<h3>吳市長邀集新聞界報告市政設施商討各項問題　一切困難為經濟　失學兒童近廿萬　收支不敷開源節流　解決房荒鼓勵造屋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時，吳市長於市府會議室，招待本埠各報社負責人，舉行第三次座談會。出席者馮有　，程滄波，王芸生，陳訓念，左舜生，詹文滸，顧執中，趙敏恒，袁榮裕等三十餘人。吳市長先就市府編制，公產處理，收支情形，工程現狀等點，有所報告，並請於淸潔，敎育，房荒，交通等問題，加以討論，會塲於和諧而熱烈空氣中進行，至五時許始散。</p>
<p>吳市長先就市府編制提出報告，略謂：市府編制龐大，誠爲事實，今已決定三項原則辦理：（一）市府員工人數，不能超過以前市政府，公共租界工部局，及法租界公董局三機關職員總數。或以爲目前市府事繼統一，人數當可較前更爲减少，但過去此三個區域内市民總數，共約三百四十餘萬，今則已向市府領取身份證之市民，即已達三百六七十萬，若再加入尙未領證之人數合計，上海全市市民人數當在四百五十萬左右，人數旣增，業務亦繁，故市府職員，實已不能再减。（二）市府簡任人員擬請增加，上海與內地都市不同，内地市府職員，能有一二人通曉外國語，即可應付，而上海市府中，有相當地位之職員，即非通曉二國以上語言不可。荐任委任職人員之中，人才實係太少，上海文化水準甚高，辦事不易，外國政界職位之高低，　視服務性質而定，上海市府，若欲以漢口重慶等市府之組織，實屬不易辦到，故簡任以上職員，必須增加。（三）關於市府附設機構，百分之八九十皆係前英法租界時代所原有，其他如救濟失業工人委員會等組織，雖無前例，又爲事實上所不能不增設者。其他機構，現正嚴加考核中，如無存在必要，自必裁撤。市長嗣又談及市府縮編現狀，謂市府及所屬各局已裁三百七十餘，內市府本部裁百餘人。</p>
<h3>市有公產決不變賣　收支不敷開源節流</h3>
<p>關於市府公產處理，各報有批評市府不加淸理且謀變賣者，市長稱：「我手裏的公產決不變賣。」但此事非市府公產淸理委員會所能辦，而必須根據土地法，經行政院核准，民意機關（如市參議會）同意。目前應先由各局將接收淸册交地政局淸理，然後聽任市民加以審閱，並將公開徵求撿舉有無隱匿。風聞法租界公產移交僞組織時，曾有隱匿情事，市府已向法領署提出詢問。</p>
<p>市府收支不敷，確係事實，解決之方，自無非開源與節流二途，開源之法，市府不能說，如諸君有能增加收入而不煩擾人民之高見，極望指敎。</p>
<p>兩大工程</p>
<p>關於市府所辦工程，化費較大者一爲防汎工程，市府在此方面，已付費用八萬萬元，而工務局所要求者則至少爲一百萬萬。其次爲海塘工程，市府亦已倖出十萬萬元。</p>
<p>市長又提及取締碼頭盜竊之風，市府已加注意。前曾根據密報，捕獲碼頭三十六股黨匪徒十九人，内數人且係著名要犯。市長旋就淸潔，學齡兒童失學·房荒，及交通阻塞等四問題，請在座者發表意見。</p>
<p>教育方面</p>
<p>市長謂根本上學校不够，若欲添設，市府經費又極困難問題殊難解決。顧執中乃主張不如使中小學在夜間亦可開辦，且使學生仍有正式資格。王芸生稱：其男女公子六人，現皆為轉學問題忙於應考，奔波烈日之下，極爲可憐。其最小公子欲進幼稚園，竟亦須上下午皆忙於應考，彼主張後方來滬學生如有正式證明文件，實可令彼等免試入學。此外後方學生得領取公費津貼之辦法，彼亦主張仍予繼續。吳市長稱：現市立小學共收學生六萬六千人，私立小學約收學生二十萬一千人，共有二十萬七千人就學，但按之上海人口，學童應有四十五萬人左右。如改二班制，可增四百八十班，入學兒童可增二萬四千人，惟須增敎師七百人，市府負担又增一萬四千萬矣。如令學生繳納若干等師金，如按月每人付二千元，當爲家長所力能負担，則擴充即可辦到，于於清貧學生自可免餐。馮有真主張半天上課制，俾一校可抵二校之用。彼以爲市立小學學費不妨酌量提高，但不必另立交際費等名目。左舜生謂市府亦應注意社會敎育，上海不應無一能容萬人之公立圖書館。其後趙敏恒·詹文滸亦各發表意見。至此吳市長又謂。</p>
<p>上海房荒</p>
<p>確亦事實、現已擬定辦法：（一）將　交通便利之區，令業主速行造屋，中央銀行可予補助費用，如業主延不筑則將以彼之土地作為股份，令地產業公會代造，如再不肯允諾，則市府將向其微收相當費用。（二）造平民村一百五十幢，但登記者過多，租價低則爭奪不均，租價高則又有營利之嫌，故擬出售後，得款再造新屋。</p>
<p>清潔問題</p>
<p>目前垃圾堆積，市府派卡車出淸，頗不經濟，將來擬責成保甲辦理，每家必備一盛垃圾之容器，於定時集中一處，再加淸除，衛生局正草擬辦法中。</p>
<p>交能問題</p>
<p>擬定辦法數項：（一）指定停車地段，（二）增加單程路綫，（三）將來空軍必須停於指定地點，不准在馬路行走。此事細則，當於八月十五日會議中決定。</p>

<h3>楊文道案當年舉發一證人　岳州輪上冤家路狹捉住「曹操」　曾無易姓化名圖被獲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨九時半，停泊於金陵路外灘太古碼頭之岳州輪汽笛頻嗚，即將駛往香港，忽有一黑牌汽軍疾駛而至，一靑年率領法醫一人，直至輪上三等艙中。其時一五十餘歲形容消瘦之廣東男子。腿用紗布包紮，正坐於帆布上，瞥見彼等走進，立將俯伏牀上，並戴黑色眼鏡，一若避其注意。此靑年非他，實即楊文道之子漢枝，而此五十餘歲之男子，亦即楊案重要證人，當年舉發楊文道爲槍殺中山秀雄兇手之曾元進（即曾元）也。法警問曾元姓名時，曾元答曰：「姓曹名操。」楊漢枝乃直斥其妄，指其確係曾元本人，並謂衣袋中有照片可證。法警亦出示傳票，曾元見傳票上有「抗傳即拘」，及「交法警帶回」等語，不禁面無人色，俯首無詞，將其囊中鈔票及所御手鏤等物，交付其友，相偕隨楊等登岸，步入汽車，而至浙江路高院。楊漢枝自前晚八時，即在該輪守候，至此時乃已苦等十四小時之久，使此乘隙圖逃之曾元，終不能作逍遙漏網之魚。</p>
<p>法院於十二時三十分開臨時偵查庭詢問，首將楊文道提到，詢年籍畢，即提曾元，曾元在此森　法庭之上，不再自稱曹操。法官詢其是否認識楊文道，答曰認識。又謂鄭偉民亦於打嗎啡針時相識，而另一證人張琛則爲其自小同學。法官遂即翻閱卷宗，嚴詢當時何以串詞陷害，曾元答謂全無此事，法官遂極震怒，囑解檢察處偵查。於是曾元遂於日本投降一周紀念日之下午，被解至十年前拘押楊文道之地檢處看守所。</p>

<h3>金磗案審結候判　楊德威等詳供把金磗押賣經過　陳元盛仍供一時糊塗出此下策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行被　金磗案，昨日下午二時半在地方法院刑二庭，由　推事再審。並傳前市銀行襄理兼營業科主任潘家　，副主任楊德威二人到庭。主犯陳元盛及其他被告吳明剛·王樹梅·陳有慶·施祥隆等均出庭。審詢共歷三小時，至五時半始畢。該案已審訊終結，定本月十五日上午十二時宣判。</p>
<p>據楊德威供稱：四月廿四日下午二時，潘　　命我陪同王樹梅（鑫大股票號經理，代表出面做押款者）將金磗交吳明剛（重慶銀行襄理，收受押款者）抵押，因王與吳不識，故命我介紹。當時潘祇言金磗為朋友要做押款。交給吳後，因時間匆促兼信用關係，亦未看過。十餘分鐘，即帶回押款申請書。五月四日上午十一時半，陳元盛要　去，乃託我打電話由三泰銀行買進。由重慶銀行老司務將金磗背去，我不識英文（金磗上有英文），亦未知該金磗係　得來云。詰之潘家謬稱：民國二十四年時，與陳元盛同為練習生，故早已相識。四月二十四日陳携金磗來時，稱貨係代朋友押款，該金磚係用紙包。因重慶銀行不放款予私人，而王樹梅爲鑫大經理，故叫王樹梅代表出面做押款。我到手利息一角三分半，到期時，我不替他賣，結果由楊德威代原主賣予三泰銀行陳有慶，市價一百六十一萬五千。我不知黄金不能抵押，因銀行公會三月二十日有通告稱可以云云。</p>
<p>主犯陳元盛剃平頭，穿格子紡短衫裤。仍稱：係一時糊塗，沒有辦法，才出此下策。其他數被告之供詞仍與上次相仿。至此，各辯護律師紛紛起立爲當事人辯護，至五時半始畢。庭論辯論終結，定十五日宣判。陳元盛還押，其他各被告仍交原保。</p>

<h3>來函</h3>
<p>逕啓者敬籌　貴報十日刊載東北鐵路警察總局獨立警察第一大隊長李銘恩致貴報函一節，其來函實有淆亂聽聞之處。緣以巡查憲兵班長於未發生事態之先，已派憲兵三名送回胃充憲兵之嫌疑犯三人（非交警），故留該院僅該班長及憲兵陳峯一名，其時在座交警約三十餘人，事實何敢毆打其官長？並當時係班長一人趨前詢間，被交警一人用電筒打擊該班長之右頸，繼而羣起毆打，此時另一憲兵出而制止，乃同被毆打，並搶去手槍，爾時情形，院方知之甚詳，此其一。又當本隊吳排長進入其大隊部與李大隊長談判甚洽之際，何致外面動武？緣以有該隊警士一人由後門繞道出來走向憲兵隊伍，憲兵予以詢問，而該警士乃向其營房大呼：「憲兵捉我，同志們救命呀」！因而交警方面一時激動，，初由營内圍牆上向憲兵發一槍，（據稱係手槍聲音），繼由馬路兩旁之營房内衝出警士數十人，大喊：「衝呀！殺呀！」之擊，各持湯姆生，卡平，及步槍，手槍等向憲兵衝殺，致此少數憲兵一時逃匿無踪，此其二。又當其衝出營房之際亂行射擊。前後不無有誤，因其時憲兵寡不敵衆，係向其營房以右之餘姚路逃避者，而其受傷者係在其營房前之常德路，且馬路以右（向餘姚路方向之常德路右邊人行道上）之受傷者，係槍彈着左臂，再入左腋，由右前腰貫出者。靠左一人係槍彈由臀部射入而由前腹射出者。且二名均頭部向餘姚路憲兵方向，事實顯係爲其後面射來之槍彈所傷，因設若爲憲兵之槍彈所傷，彈必由傷者前面射入，並向後倒此其三。凡此事實不可抹煞，尙望權威輿論界人仕實地察堪，多方訪問，請爲公理之更正，實深惑荷。滬西憲兵隊隊長孫吉第啓。</p>

<p>昨天淸最，江海關大鐘正敲八下，黄浦灘邊的水上飯店，已破例地熱閙起來了，工務局長趙祖康，結構處處長兼海塘工程總隊長朱國治·秘書錢維藩·及中美工商協會駐滬辦車處處長史密斯女士，加上各報男女記者，將水上飯店佔去了一大半。趙局長站了起來，他說：「今天是本局招待各位記者去參觀高橋海塘工程，這工程是上月中開工的，當時也曾經招待過二次記者，現在，海塘工程將於下月中完工了，所以特地再招待各位去參觀……」。</p>
<p>八時半了，灘邊市渡輸，鳴嗚的叫聲，在催我們上船，趙局長匆匆地結束了他的談話，大家便一擁上船。</p>
<p>船漸漸地蠕動了，足足欣賞了一個半鐘頭，輸渡把我們帶到了高橋。上了岸，工務局置備的專軍，已經在碼頭邊等待着我們了，從高橋鎭到海塘，還有三公里的距離。我們坐在大汽車中，其感覺是異樣的，車子走在窄狭崎嶇的泥路上，跳動得利害，路旁的樹木，不時伸進車窗，朝乘客頭部臉部亂打。</p>
<p>海塘邊，一堆堆的築堤的原料，大石塊，碎石子，木料，洋炭，細砂等，堆得高高地，工人們正沿着海濱打木椿，猛烈的太陽，把他們一個個地晒成　黑。他們的工作是艱苦的，但却是偉大的！海塘是本市的屏障，但因年久失修，塘身已大部坍圯，爲防止泛濫起見，市府決搶修此項緊急工程。</p>
<p>搶修的工程分四個步驟：（一）奠基，（二）打橋，（三）澆水門汀，（四）舖大石塊。據朱處長說：經過這次搶修工程後，至少可保三十年太平無事，而假使再不加以修復，那麼泥堤日以繼夜地受海水的猛擊，經過四五十年後，高橋將告不堪設想！</p>
<p>我們舉行「室内的野餐」之後，又沿着海塘，參觀了另外二個決口，然後沿着原路，汽車把我們載向高橋碼頭。登上市渡輪，工人的「杭育」「　育」的吶喊聲，又在耳邊饗起，</p>
<p>迷迷糊糊中，輪渡已重回上海，踏上黄浦灘，江海關的大鐘，正敲三時半。（斯在）</p>

<h3>教部派楊秘書來滬發給大學教職員補助金　京滬總數一萬萬四千萬　款由美援華會交到教部　南京方面定十五日發給</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕自勝利之後，物價飛漲，生活程度日高，以京滬兩地爲尤甚。京滬兩地各大學教授，因受生活嚴重壓迫，六七兩月間，一再向敎部呼　。敎部杭次長關心此事，曾赴滬與各大學敎授竭誠談話，並在京與各大學敎授開會交換意見。此事從敎授方面言，實際情狀，必須救濟，惟爲整個之公教人員而論，事權屬於行政院，應通盤籌畫，不易有完滿解決。幸現在公敎人員之新待遇，已見調整，而敎部杭次長爲各敎授當前，必須救助之事實問題，已盡最大之努力，商得美國援華委員會之贊助，在短短期問，巳撥國幣一萬萬四千萬元，爲補助中國各大學敎授之臨時費用。此款並已交到敎育部，敎部派秘書楊少白，已於九日午車赴滬，辦理發給此項補助金事宜。聞公私立（私立已立案者）專科以上學校敎職員，皆可得有此項補助金，敎授每員十萬元，副敎授每員九萬元，講師與助敎每位皆爲八萬元，職員每位七萬元，一次補助。南京方面之公私專科以上敎職員之補助金，定十五日發給。</p>

<h3>廣州中等以上學校學生報名額遠超招生額　投考職業學校負担較輕</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州訊〕中山日報最近爲大學及中學學生求學問題，作一個簡單報導云：「廣州是華南的一個重鎭，但它的文化水準，比起平津京滬等地方，是低落得多，而學校又少得可憐，統計全市的公私立學校最多不過一百所。這一個可憐的數目，無怪乎成了一般求學者的父母們焦慮。記者爲使一般父母們明瞭各校的概况，特在這裏來作一個簡單的報導，以供參攷：</p>
<p>大學方面</p>
<p>下學期本市各大學有國立中同大學·省立文理學院·省立法商學院·私立嶺南大學·廣州·國民大學·中華文化學院·統計上列各校招生的總額約有三千名。此外，北京·南開·清華大大學，也在廣州招生，這三所大學預計在全國招生的名額不過一千名，而本市要投考大學總共二萬三千名左右，照比例是一比七，因此，下學期投考大學是相當困難的。投考之前，須慎密地選擇學校和科目，並須有充分的地備。</p>
<p>中學方面</p>
<p>省立的中學有　勤·執信·仲元·廣雅·中正·女師等，市立的有市師·市一中·私立的有培正·培道·　南附中·真光·協和·培英·培桂·華南·華僑·長風等，可是私立的中學，下學期收貨會使一般父母負担加重，每所私立學校的收費大概是：高中學米一百司斤，學費二萬五千元，堂雜費二萬五千元，初中學米八十可斤，學費二萬元，堂雜費二萬元，小學學米六十司斤，學雜費三萬元。以這個數目，一個普通的家庭，如果有幾個孩子求學的話，父母們肩上的重担，眞是透不過氣來。私立學校的收費問題，上面的「大概數目」當然是太大一些。省立的學校，因有政府的津貼，只需交數千元的雜費便可以了，但投考學校之時，又會成爲困難的問題了。職業學校——在省外國立的職校有南昌中正醫學院，武昌海事職業學校，市立的有市一職，私立的有會計學校，及中華女子職學校，如果是有志學習專門的技術，投考職業學校是最好不過的。私立職校的收費，普通家庭的父母大都可以負担得起的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行頃又以第四十九號通兩致送各指定經營外匯銀行，略稱：中央銀行近據報有若干進口商，在未獲中央銀行准許前，仍自國外輸入原料，故特再函各指定銀行知照，設該項原棉之進口，事前並未獲得中央銀行之准許，各指定銀行不得結售外匯。如有違反該項規定者，指定銀行將受停止經營外匯樊務之處分，進口商將不再給予結騰外匯之便利。又據本市進出口界消息：最近數週，本市若干進口商及各廠商，曾先後向美國訂購原棉遠十萬包之多，共計金額達美金二千萬元。今中央銀行突頒發第四十九號通函，不啻使該項原棉定貨，全部擱淺。據悉：最近進口商方面亦曾向印度訂購大批原棉。而購取該項原棉所需之資金，可不假中央銀行之手，而係通過香港結款。交割手續，恒在本市辦理。以法幣，港幣付款，或以私人電匯頭襯對劃。最近數週來，曾藉此項交易辦法，成交大批印度原棉，而未受中央銀行之千涉。故有一部份進口商及廠商等，遂亦同時向美國及巴西一帶，訂購原棉。進口商及廠商方面認爲本市原棉之消耗量，日趨增加，中央銀行可能考慮對此批原棉之進口，供給外匯。茲以中央銀行第四十九號通函觀之，此項期望，顯然巳告絕望。各進口商以中央銀行旣未正式宣佈禁止原棉進口，又容忍大批印度棉進口，且事前又未在條例中規定，每筆原棉新交易，必須經過核准手續，致進口商方面，乃又繼印棉之大批進口後，紛向美國訂購原棉。又據悉：在四十九號通函未頒發前，進口商對進口美棉之貨款，本可以美鈔抵付，或以美鈔用私人電匯頭襯對劃。茲經過中央銀行此番警告後，各指定銀行，當不能再接受此項辦法結付貨款。</p>
<p>記者旋以此事走詢中央銀行外匯審核處長林維英氏，據告：中央銀行第四十九號通函，原係　申該行本年四月廿七日所發通函之規定。緣該次通函早已規定：除另行通知外，即日起各指定銀行對新訂購之原棉，一概不得結售官價外匯。渠稱：目前本市原棉存量殊爲充沛，可供用至明年二月，故實無再行進口之必要，以免徒耗外匯資金。林氏指最近大批印度原棉之進口，轉輾結匯辦法，實屬不合法云。</p>

<p>烚赤昨仍在原處徘徊，晨開一九三萬二，開後先見一九二萬五，後以登記配給關係，買氣稍止而告微降，十時後央行配給四十條，價仍爲一九一萬七五，入後曾回低至一九一萬五，交易奇少，難起大變，午刻仍在一九二萬光景，午後微有扳高，結果較前收升起一萬一，飾金紋銀銀元均無變動，暗拆息價仍站一角二三分，銀根供求漸平。</p>

<h3>大批臺糖即將到滬　配售辦法將有變更　價格照舊兩星期配給一次　公會合作社外向公司申請</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據台糖公司負責人語記者稱：在最近三週中，該公司將自台灣基隆，陸續裝運食糖一萬九千噸（約合二十餘萬包）來滬。照預定日期，第一批食糖九千噸，約合十萬包，將於本月十八日，由招商局海宇輪裝運抵滬。第二及第三批食糖，各爲五千噸，每批約合五萬五千五百餘包，將於本月廿六日及下月二日，分由合灣航業公司台南輸，及台安輸船公司臺安輸，裝運來滬。故本市存糖將益形充沛。</p>

<h3>外銷茶存底漸空　英商洋行均赴杭採購</h3>
<p>查陳久之外銷茶，大都係太平洋事變後，擱置迄今，故品質方面，不免發生變化，偶有少數身骨較佳者，連日出口行家鑒於價格相宜，因此均被搜羅一空，惟刻下買戶雖續有胃納，然終因適合外銷者，市上存底寥若晨星，購者乃紛紛赴杭州選購，茲據彼地消息，目前英商怡和，協和等洋行俱有騐看還盤，且聞協和洋行已辦就陳中祁門四百餘箱，價每担七萬五千元，市氣穩定，前途恐續有扶搖直上之望，至於本市洋莊交易，昨由午昌茶葉公司進陳抽珍，陳珍眉陳針眉等共三百二十餘箱，華茶公司扒進紅茶一百五十箱，又新貨白琳一百廿箱，過程依然缺少波動，而新貨白琳紅茶則較開盤時，每担狂落逾半，但以品質關係，趣勢不脫明跌暗平，此外紅綠茶內銷　呈活發汪裕泰茶號吸進溫州新炒靑一百廿担，價每担五萬至五萬二千元，餘若陳紹炒苞種茶，新龍井等，垂靑者並不乏人，行情始終逗留佳境。</p>

<p>遠期外匯，中央銀行曾規定三個月結匯，無論購買機器，工業原料，及其他貨物，到期不結匯者，即作無效，由指定銀行收回匯票，是項辦法目前仍未改變，據中央銀行負責人表示，進口商所訂各貨，事前應有把握，如到期無貨，運輸無法解決者，事前應加攷慮，不能慒然從事，到期不結匯，央行絕對不許，又據另悉：指定銀行方面以各行商如確因特殊事由，國外有電報證明者，可申請轉期結匯。</p>

<h3>梅花嶺畔弔忠魂</h3>
<p>— 本報七日揚州訊　特約記者王公濣</p>
<p>閒閱明人王秀楚之「楊州十日記」，不覺念起一代英烈之明督師兵部尙書兼東閣大學士史公可法來，同時計算一下明弘光甲申年（明亡之年）到現，史公之殉身大我，正已逾三百年了。</p>
<p>一代英烈舊恨新愁</p>
<p>在另一書本上，記者又重識了有奸作明宋的恨史：「明亡之主因不在有外患，即在於內亂」。再：從中國當前的現實中，記者發生了一個感想：當前的中國的一些「英雄」們，如果仍然要稱「英雄」下去？不惜到處燃放內亂之火，使我國家民族坐失了千載難逢的復興建設的良機，則將來無任是誰執政；誰再是「民主」不過的；「進步」十三分的？「開明」則又「開明」的。然在現代國家條件具備不够的處境下；和在時間性的決定下，中國恐將終於是名存而實亡的了—換言之，最多是一個現代的「附庸國家」。</p>
<p>便是懷着這樣的舊恨與新愁的心情，月之一是，記者走訪了先烈「史忠正公」衣冠塚的所在地－梅花嶺。憑弔了一代英烈的史閣部的忠魂。</p>
<p>揚州府志史公列傳</p>
<p>惟一記述憑弔的經過之前，記者想：先考查一下史公可法的身世，是有必要的。關於史公可法的身世，記得戰前「閒話揚州」的作者易君左有一本「民族英雄故事集」中曾有記叙，以及正中書局版之單行本「史可法」，其記叙尤詳。但，這裏的篇幅恐不容許那麼做了，以下我們就祇抄錄「揚州府志」上的一段記載吧：</p>
<p>「先忠正公列傳：史可法，字憲之，順天大興人。母尹氏，有娠時夢文天祥入其舍，生可法。崇楨無年成進士；累官右僉都御史，巡撫安慶廬州等處。奏免被災田租，募壯士，繕田仗，日夜爲戰守計，賊避其鋒。十四年，以戶部右侍郎總督漕運。尋拜南京兵部尙書。十七年四月，聞李自成陷京城，大慟！頭觸柱，血流被體，縞衣發喪，欲長驅死賊。及福王（記者註：即弘光帝）立，馬士英擁兵入，可法知勢不兩立，請督師淮揚；加太子太保兵部尙書武英殿大學士。時高傑兵駐揚州，被淫掠死者無算。可法具疏以瓜洲屯其衆，揚州以安。可法遂開府揚州，關禮賢館。四方才智，悉任用之。屢疏請餉，士英靳不發；每疏請討賊，復殿淚俱下，扼於馬阮（記者註：馬士英阮大鋮皆明末奸臣。）獲報即已。次年四月，左良玉東下，王手書召可法入援。即日發兵，渡江抵燕子確，聞良玉已敗，乃令速還。抵天長，一日夜奔摥州檄調各鎭兵無一至。二十日清（記者註：原文爲大字，記者改之，后同。）兵至，屯班竹園。總兵李棲鳳，監軍副使高歧鳳，拔營出降，城中勢益孤。諸文武分陴拒守；舊城西門最險要，可法自守之。作書寄母妻爲訣。以無子，命副將史德威爲之後。越二日，清兵薄城下。城破，可法自刎不死，命德威刃之，德威痛器，不敢仰視。一參將擁出小東門，爲清兵所執，可法大呼曰：我史督師也，可速殺我。勸之降，不從，遂殺之。揚州知府任民育，同知曲畏，羅伏龍，兩淮鹽運使揚振熙，監餉知縣吳道正，江都縣丞王志端，幕客胡如日中天瑆，盧渭皆從死。」</p>
<p>有這麼多同時殉難的先烈，記者覺得：前往梅花嶺畔憑弔，是吏應該的了。</p>
<p>部長匾額氣壯山河</p>
<p>嶺在揚城廣儲門外－然所謂嶺，實乃一小土邱。史公之祠堂傍嶺而築，東有廳房共十數間，內置「梅花仙館」，史公畫像處，及碑石多方。西有廳房三大間。衣冠塚位在祠堂的正中，四周環繞松柏，木柵爲欄。州前竪一高大的石碑，上勒「明督師兵部尙書兼東閣大學士之墓」字樣。</p>
<p>記者出天寗門，（廣儲門戰前即已閉塞）沿河向東，不久便到達了目的地。步進大門，沒有出於記者意料的，立即落入眼簾者：祠內各處屋宇的外壳雖尙完好，所有的裝修則已破敗不堪！那正廳前的院落中，記得戰前是有數株松柏的，已沒有了。然正廳之前樑上，有塊金色煇煌的上書「氣壯山河」四字的匾額竟仍存在。那好像是二十四年的事了，故中委王茂如（柏齡）先生集資修葺這祠堂時，何部長應欽所獻的。</p>
<p>紅梅烈日荒草蓁蓁</p>
<p>步過院落，穿踰廳堂，即達衣冠塚。塚的氣宇森然如舊，記者於塚前默肅片攜。祠內的閣人來兜作響導，他首先告訴記者：舊歷去年臘月廿五日，白崇禧將軍及洪部長蘭友曾來此致祭過。城中駐軍的長官也有常來憑弔的。接着，他引記者趨至梅花嶺。不數步，記者放眼一看，情形更不堪了！戰前植有千株紅梅的園地，已落得一片荒草蓁蓁。記憶中之六角草亭，及時代遺物禎年間鑄的鐵砲一尊，都也不見了。而嶺由的梅花樹，也祇留着三二株枯黑的身幹曝在烈日喪。令人不勝悽凉之感！</p>
<p>最後絕筆一封家書</p>
<p>嶺幾張　之「碑亭」，外壳亦尙存在，嵌在壁上的石碑亦尙完好，史公可法最後的絕筆書，戰前記者家山本有拓本收藏。而現在，詢問響道者，連詞中管事者也沒一份存的。讀該絕筆書，令人感悲壯無已，記者遂從碑上抄錄了下來，全文及格式如左：</p>
<p>「恭候</p>
<p>太太，</p>
<p>楊太太</p>
<p>夫人萬安！北兵於十八日圍揚城，至今尚未攻打，然人心已去，收拾不來。法早晚必死，不知夫人肯隨我去否？如此世界，生亦無益，不如早早決斷也。太太苦惱，須託四太爺大爺，三可，大家照管，（記者註：乃史公之女公子）照兒好歹，隨他罷了，書至此，肝腸寸斷矣！四月二十一日法寄」</p>
<p>出師表後第一奇文</p>
<p>又史公之復濟攝政王多爾袞書，其忠心之耿耿，固充溢宇裏行間，而文宇的潔麗與雄渾，有謂是「出師表」以後之第一篇奇文，實並不虛妄。然原文欲從石碑上抄限困難。因爲字體旣草而亂不易辨別。字數又有二千多也。</p>
<p>兩副對聯一巾畫像</p>
<p>從碑亭轉至史公畫像供置處，承管理祠堂者賈君特將一輻珍貴的原畫像拿出來給記者觀看。及談些：待時局平定，祠堂屋宇內外，需要重修才好，然從那裏有這筆經費呢？……等話，又抄了兩副好對聯，一副是：「生有自來文信國，死而後已武郷侯」。一副是：「數點梅花亡國淚，一分明月故臣心。」黜誦着這兩謂　聯，記者告別了忠魂；離開了梅花嶺。</p>
<h3>西安市政</h3>
<p>— 本報二日本安航訊　記者李馳</p>
<p>「七水繞長安」雖已過去，但望藉機械之力，角決給水問題，促市政之發展。</p>
<p>大熱天，水的需要尤其使人一刻難忘。在乾燥的黃土地帶上輝煌一時的古都西安，證諸文獻，確曾有過便利而豐足的水源，所謂「七水繞長安」，並不是句假話，這七條水的洄流情形，至今仍不難追溯。可惜後來人謀不臧，深闊的河床日見淺窄，好些甚至終年乾涸而變成史跡了。如何恢復水的充分供應，實在是當前市政一條重要課題，而且是今後發展市政一個先決條件。因爲水非特關乎市民的分健康康，同時，它的供應充分限制着都市人口的密集，高層建築的建立，和若干部門工業的發展。擺在目前這件事情就可作爲反面的證明：七月初以來，西安市電廠缺煤而停止供電，普通電戶的電燈機電風扇都停息了，西安冰廠的馬達也拖累着了，而無數市民一向要靠冰廠汲水設備所供給的食用水，立刻隨而漲價四倍。我們終年眼看着用人力獸力拖着排滿了水木水桶的水車，走遍全城供給一部分人幾爲認爲是「珍品」的食用水，這情形一天不改善，發展市政的其他優良條件，尙有保留的餘地。試想想：這樣的情况能讓它繼續下去吧？一個低級的公教人員每月全部的收入，不够他月中隔天上一次澡堂的化費！</p>
<h3>粵展開綏靖工作</h3>

<p>兩週前，吹來了一陣颱風，把熱浪吹散了！近幾天來，幾乎每晚都下一塲雨，使這個南方瀕海的省份，顯得格外平靜似的；在這裏，在這裏，所有各報的地方新聞版上，不但驚人的消息沒有，就連較爲足以刺激的新聞也沒有；不過在這平靜的空氣中，却也有值得報道的，就是本省當局最近對治安·糧食·交通等種種設施，都在積極的計劃和推進。</p>

<p>先談治安吧。過去了中共武裝人員還沒有撤退，許多地方的土匪都說他們是中共的，以致政府的剿匪推行，受到莫大障碍。而且中共的負責人曾聲明廣東已無共軍，那對本省的剿匪工作，自然順利得多。於是當局便決定了全省的綏靖計劃，在綏靖期間，准許土匪投誠自首，如逾期不悟，則實行分區作大規模搜剿，這搜剿工作是由駐防當地的國軍和保安隊負責。同時飭令各清剿區組設特別機構，實行清郷工作，健全保甲制度，並被發械彈，加強民衆自衛武力。行營張主任發奎，月前曾親自出巡東北江劃定了各清剿區縣份：計粵湘贛過區爲粵之和平·連平·南雄·翁源·始興·曲江·仁化七縣：湘之桂東，汝城二縣；贛之南康·信豐·安遠·潯久鄔·蘢南·大廋等十縣。在此區域內各行政區，由黨政軍首長及士紳組清郷督導委會，各縣組清郷工作團。粵閩贛邊區則側重於蕉嶺·平遠·大埔·饒平·永定·上杭·韶安一帶，並東江組韓江清剿委會，由各縣長充委員，負責清剿。至瓊崖方面，可說是土匪最猖獗的地方，該地結集土匪約達四千餘名，省府羅主席曾偕同保安副司令韋鎭福赴瓊崖視察，召開綏靖會議，最近更決定增調保安團隊至該地圍剿，設立拐杖安司令部瓊崖指揮所，由韋副司令鎭福充任指揮，並扶植地方民衆武力協助。現在全省民衆武力整編後，估計可增加武裝二萬之衆。這個綏靖計劃，是決定八月一日全面展開，限期兩月內肅清餘匪；相信經過這次澈底清剿土匪之後，粵省治安，當益臻鞏固了。</p>
<p>組施政督導團</p>
<p>察訪各地實情</p>
<p>關於省政方面，最重要的一個工作，就是省府在上月份組織了一個施政督導團。由各省府委員率領民財建教四廳，田糧處人員分七區出發督導，人們的任務是：（一）注重過去稅征收情形，及指示今後新財政系統辦理。（二）田賦征實征借準備工作督導。（三）地方保甲制度現狀與健全組織。（四）公路交通修復。（五）救濟工地方作舉辦情形。（六）救助育現狀及今後改善推行辦法。（七）治安維持與民衆力量自衛。（八）各項禁政近况。除了這八項，還有貪汚之檢舉，地方經濟和社會一般動態，都是他們所注間的。由上月十五日起，各區的督導團已經先後的出發了。</p>
<p>糧食明年增產</p>
<p>可望自給自足</p>
<p>至於本省的糧食問題，恐怕不少人會關懷的。記者上次曾報導過，本省糧茺的狂潮，似已安然渡過。不過本省究屬缺糧的省份，而且今年雨水不調，收成頗受影響響，現調查各江情形，還談不上豐收。根據統計，於下半年間，全省糧食不跳數額。約一千五百萬担。雖然在治標方面，當局已有了向省外購米濟粵和積存郷榖備荒，繼續提倡節約等辦法。但這些辦法大槪僅可解決了今年的問題，但是要以後能自給自足，那根本的還早要推行農田水利，積極墾荒增產，所以本省的五年計劃中，這一項列爲首要工作。現農林處對此正積極計劃，最近向農行借貸十八萬萬元，爲興辦各地水利灌田之需，並督促各縣厲行一保一塘運動。同時據善運到種籽三百敀十四桶，並二千噸肥田料運抵九龍，本省可望分得肥田料一萬五千噸，將陸續運來應用。至於殺虫粉亦已運到一部。此外還有一千五百套農具在運粵途中……如果這報告是可　的話，那對糧食增產，當然更大有裨助；預算頂多在明年，本省的糧食，便可自供自足，而再不需仰仗外來的了！</p>
<p>擬修公路幹綫</p>
<p>約八千餘公里</p>
<p>最後，關於本省的交通建設現况，也值　一說的。在鐵路方面，廣九，廣州三，和粵漢區這三條鐵路，都已行後恢復通車了。目前當局認爲產通上最重要的工作。就是本省公路幹綫的修復。計本省原有公路一萬四千五百一十八公里，經戰時破壞後僅存通車路綫爲四百一十七公里，比對僅存不足三十五分之一。由於交通不便，這對本省的經濟建設，自有莫大影響。按公路處的計劃，應修通的公路共有八千二百餘公里，計通本省各重要市鎭幹綫三、九七〇·七公里，通國際港口路綫二、九二七·九公里，通內地各省幹綫一、三二一·六公里·但因工程浩大，共需工款四二、三八五、一〇七、七九七元，而中央補助工款又未能即刻撥發，所以爲適應復員急迫需要，祇有就財力許可，先將各主要交通路段，搶修通車。現已修通的有廣韶，官興，韶庾，雄信，廣增，燈河博，梅汕，翁虔，及韶小等主要公路幹綫。據建廳謝德長文龍表示：省庫以財力不逮，而中央又補助無多，今後擬扶助商人，先建築本省海岸東西兩大公路，以廣州爲中心點，西綫出佛山，江門，鶴山，恩平，台山，陽江，電白，水東，而以雷州半島最南端之海安市爲終點；東綫由本市出東莞，惠陽，海響，陸豐，葵潭，惠來等地而至汕頭，再出而達福建。此兩公路現有今天地段已通車，亦有若干地段具備胚型，今次推動建築，乃在彼此能够互相銜接而已。從這樣看來，本省的公路交通，於短斯間當有長足的進展。</p>

<h3>急待解決的蘇北土地問題</h3>
<p>— 葛克信</p>
<p>坑戰以後的蘇北，直到勝利將滿一年的今天，不曾有過一大安定的日子。最初只有國軍與敵軍，漸漸的增加了數說不清遊擊隊，又漸漸的產生了「新四軍」，後來遊擊隊受不住敵人和「新四軍」的夾攻，終於一部份變成僞軍。國軍與敵軍對壘，遊擊隊向遊擊隊侵吞，「新四軍」又和遊擊隊及國軍廝殺。孤立在蘇北的國軍，得不着外來的接濟，固須靠當地人民的供應；敵人根據「以戰養戰」的原則，更不斷的征軍糧；詐降擊隊要遊食；「新四軍」向老百姓搜括的又叫「公糧」。除去種種騷擾及戰鬥當時所受的損失不計外，這些經常而名目不同的負擔，必乎榨出了蘇北每個農民的最後一滴血！可是在強力的壓迫下，尤其爲了神聖的民族戰爭，蘇北農民都默默的忍受過去了。誰知道勝利之後，還要受到比從前更普遍而殘酷的災禍呢</p>
<p>「新日軍」在蘇北，顯然是乘戰時的混亂及某些不可諱言的政治上的弱點而得立足，以至壯大。當「新四軍」得到發展之後，整個蘇北除了少數交通較便的幾「點」以外，所有的「面」似乎都被它從國軍，從遊擊隊，從僞軍，以及從投降後的敵人手裏分別佔領並控着制，一面加強「鬥爭」，並帶來了若干所謂「大翻身」的設施。搞昏了人們頭腦的口號和刑罰，這兒暫且擱起不談，所要特別指出的，是中共在蘇北所加於土地上的變革。</p>
<p>無論中共的什麼名義，「清算」也罷，「减租」也罷，「罰糧」也罷，沒收漢奸「準漢奸」及「漢奸底子」的財產也罷，終究掩藏不了償的，暴力的，所加於土地上的變革。我同意任何學者或黨派所懷抱土地再分配的理想，但我堅決反對中共在蘇北這樣的做法。前幾天孫宋慶齡女士對當前時局意見內說：「民生主義在今日指人民不能再受飢餓」以「土地問題必須合理解決」，「國民黨必須執行它的歷史任務－土地改革」。這此話，誰也不能否認她說的對；可是土地改革，在其實行過程中，國共兩黨在方法上是很有一些距離的。而此次中共在蘇北的做法，旣非「擁護三民主義」的做法，却亦不是實行共產主義的做法。它之所謂土地變革，至少在目前這一階段，僅是爲達成其他某種企圖的一個手段而已。假使孫宋慶齡女士能認清楚了這個事實，我想她一定會發生一些新的感想，也一定會同情那些被趕逐出來的「蘇北難民」，而且一定認爲這些被中共否定了生存權的「人民」也應該一樣「有權利起來反抗饑餓的」。</p>
<p>我不論辯當前蘇北動亂的責任，我要討論的是當前蘇北軍事局勢正在迅速的轉變着，伴隨而來的必然就是政治上的轉變，而其中最主要一點，無疑是處理土地問題。幾年來中共控制下的蘇北土地，顯然有了若干變動，沒收的給沒收了。分配的給分配掉，這課題到了我們手裏，就得問：應該怎麼辨呢？</p>
<p>中共在蘇北對土地上的措施，可分下列幾點說明：</p>
<p>（一）以無代價沒收來的土地，再轉賣給農民。——如前面提過的，中共曾沒收過不少的土地，而對於原來的地主除給與一個罪名之外，不費任何代價，然後就把這一些田地轉賣給另一些人。非中共黨員或非參與「民兵」的「征屬」，不知是無權購買呢，還是他們不敢問津？因爲據我們所知道的，比較忠厚的農民，確實很少承買到這樣田地。至於這些田地出賣價格，並無一定標準，承買人所的代價，則是完全歸於中共所有。不過也有得到田地而不出代價的，那自然是中共作爲「賜田」用的。</p>
<p>（二）以「罰糧」名義逼迫地主出賣田地。——長期被騷據被剝蝕下的所謂地主，早已到了山窮水盡的境界，今天來個「减租」，明天再來一個「清算」，結果命令「罰糧」若干方能了事。地主接受命令之後，自須繳出照命令規定的糧數，於是不得不低價出賣他們的田地，再以高價購進足够的食糧去充罰。這樣，恰似一據犀利的剪刀，逼得可憐的地主們不得不連續低價出賣田地，直到賣完或僅能保留三五畝爲止。但有兩種情形，必須說明：（甲）由地主找買人，憑中說合，訂立契約而出賣的，這比較上算得公平。（乙）由中共「幹部」或黨員們諭示價格，則地主無討價還價餘地，吃虧的當然是地主，不言可知。無論以上述何種方或買賣羞協，因所有權之轉移，承買人必須履行稅契手續，　進價格，却亦爲衆所周知的事實。</p>
<p>（三）以人口爲比　——這是本年二月以後才有的新辦法，在如皋泰興，靖江一帶還少實行。我們旣不能深入中共控制區域，因而無從獲知其詳。</p>
<p>如果承認上述一節爲事實的話，不難得到結論：其一，依照共產主義，不承認土地私有權，但中共在蘇北除上述第三點因詳情不明無從臆斷外，餘如（一）（二）兩點都有買賣行爲，當然是承認私有權的確證。它之所以如此措置。據我個人觀測，不出以下幾點：（1）爭取物資，（2）爭取貧農，（3）鼓勵土地生產；其二，中共採取如此措置之動機，雖不以解決土地問題爲中心，但結果却引誘起地權分散的傾向，一面分散了土地私有權。一面自然使擁有土地私有權的人數增多了。</p>
<p>提到處理共區土地問題，政府原有成規可循：一是曾經行於豫鄂皖贛諸省的「剿匪區內各省農村土地處理條例」；另一則是閩西善後委員會「計口授田暫行法」。解決同一問題，而辦法不一致，當是因地因時而制其宜的原故。閩西原屬多由而人口稀少的地方，再久經兵燹，人口更少，並問當時地主之遭殺戮者十居八九，以致事後無主之耕地甚多，且有「有地無人耕」之情况，所以決定實行計口授田，阻力旣少，並隱含獎勵生聚之意。至就歷史教訓而論，計口授田，極少成功的希望。北魏的「均田」和日本大化革新的「班田」，都是失敗的前例，不獨在變革之際，困難重重，最主要的，困難乃在若干年後，耕地未必有何增加，而人口倒逐年增加了不少，這一比例的變動，勢必使原來的規劃又形全部動搖。蘇北的地形，人口以及中共在該地區的作爲，都與閩西不同，而計口授田也不算絕好的辦法，所以無論計口授田在閩西實行的情怎樣，我不願主張實行之於蘇北。</p>
<p>其次，說到「剿匪區內各省農村土地處理條例」，按照該規定之主要各點：</p>
<p>（一）所有田地及其他不動產，以發還原主爲原則；</p>
<p>（二）設定私有田地之最高額，其超額之田地以累進率對其所收田租徵收所得稅；</p>
<p>（三）凡被共黨實行分田之處，設各級農村復興委員會，痰盂俯拾皆是　導佃農自耕農業主合組合作社，將所管理之公地及田租，移交該社管理；</p>
<p>（四）其經界已毀之國地，得由業主會議互相承認後，另劃界址，零星散碎之田地，並得加以整理；</p>
<p>（五）所有權未經確定前之田地及官荒，計口授佃，並設定限額，惟業主有優先權；</p>
<p>（六）租額由郷農村興復委員會決定，業主不得自由加租或撤　。</p>
<p>前於第一點，我們旣還承認土地私有權的存在，那末對本原則，當然同意。但根據這個原則來處理蘇北土地問題，有幾點必須分開來說：（一）中共所沒收的田地，除查明確係敵僞產業，依法應予沒收者外，其餘自應發還原主。倘使若干被中共作爲「賞賜」撥用了的田地，拿回來也不成問題。其問題是在承買人曾向中共出過相當代價，雖然可由政府命令，凡此買賣行爲一律無效，不過爲體恤承買人起見，我個人的意見以爲承買不超過某數量而又確係自耕者，與承買超過某數量而非盡用以自耕者，應該分別墅　處理。心超過某數量者，不妨無償收回交還原主；其餘自耕之國，最好能想出一點補救辦法。我固然知道補救辦法很不狗日易，而且很少，可是我們不該怕難，被救即使很少，總比一點補救沒有要好。（二）地主們出賣田地的時候，不管出賣的原因在那裏，只要憑中買賣，立有契約，這一行爲旣比較上公平，我們便應該承認其合法。我們誠然主張以發還原主爲原則，但有上述情形者應作例外。（三）出賣時倘經中共之壓迫，而不得不貶低其價格，在法律觀點上雖欠健全，但承買人却未必是中共所指定，倘使不予承認，災明明是蔑視了第三者的利益。我們根據國父孫先生的遺教，及國民黨第一次全國代表大會宣言，主張對有如此情形者，原則上也應予以承認，不過爲補償地主的損失及公平起見，應照當時公平價格，限令承買人補足那個數目。</p>
<p>關於第二點，即設定私有土地的最高額而對超額的土地以累進率徵收其田租之所得稅。這是以高稅率爲手段而實行溫和的土地變革政策，原則上我們雖沒有異議，但若應用之於蘇北，却須有所簾明。原來所謂蘇北的大地主，因爲土地有肥瘠，徐海一帶與通如淮揚就有不同。通如淮揚土壤較肥（實際可說全是水問題），其超過一千畝以上的地主，數目是很少的，通常擁有二三百畝田地的，便可算得上上富翁了。徐海一帶就不然了，那裏的土性爲較瘠薄，擁有千畝田地並不算富，够得上稱豪富，總須有田萬畝以乃至數萬畝。我知道從前述陽的秦家馬家，便都如此。所以設定最高額時，若照三省土地處理條例規定私有地最高額自一百畝至二百畝，可行於通知淮揚的，行之於徐海則未能允當。再就些次動亂期內的實際情形說，凡離開家郷較早的地主，所出賣的田地亦較少，因爲他們僅僅爲了「寓公」的生活費而變而變買了若干產業，較之勝利之後才開始逃難的，其情形大大不同。近一年內逃出來的地主，曾經過長期的掙扎，旣不逃或逃不了，就不能不應付現實，不認罰又怕遭沒收，乃不得不出於賣一點保存一點的辦法，而這樣的人却居逃難羣中的絕對多數。就通如各縣說，這些「難民」截至他們逃亡時止還能保留一二百畝以上的人，眞是少之又少了。他們經過這次變亂，也可說經過這次教訓以後，很多人思想起了變化，他們明白了「衣稅食租」的生活不合理，也知道遏止中共活動的最好好辦法是安定貧農的生活。在如此情形之下，正是推行我們理想的土地政策的機會，設定私人所有田地最高額，對其超額土地除以累進率徵收其田租所得稅一法外，我不知道對於那些超額過多的，可不可以由政府發給土地債券酌量收買一部份。又還有主張改累進稅率爲切實執行二五减租的，特附記於此，以爲研究此一問題者的參考。</p>
<p>關於第三四占，除設各級農村與復委員會爲處理機構係行政問題外，餘如組織農村利用合作社及經界已毀之國地得另劃界址，零星散碎之田地得加整理，皆爲處理土地之本身問題。友人葛羅物先生，是地主，是出身農村的人，在共區掙扎了五年；在這五年之內，他一直研究土地問題。據他的看法。農村合作社的理想當然很好，不過辦理合作社的人才確有問題，農民傳統的習慣性質及知識等也有問題，因而合作社的成績，常與惠想相反。所以他認爲二十年以後，一般都進步了，農村合作纔可能辦得好的。我提議每縣辦一個示範農塲，這農塲的規模須相當大。行總不是有農業機器嗎？不是有拔術指導嗎？平時要找一大整片土地，煞很費力，這時却便利多了，官荒，公田，及無主土地主之外，還可以征用，收買，整天理，掉換。低者，有機器使它高；高者，有機器使它低。農業機械化和生產科學化等等好處，讓農民們透得這種示範農塲，親眼看得銅陵，摸得着。我們對箊　農村的願望，豈僅只圖復興就算了呢！</p>
<p>關於第五六兩點，保障佃權及防制地主任意加租，我覺得不授佃並設限額，辦法也好。南通全縣耕地約三百萬畝，人口約一百五十萬，姑以每家五口計算，第家十畝，依生產量估計現值約合一百萬元，除去施肥等成本約五十萬元，所得約五十萬元，平均每人每月之生活費爲八千元，怎麼能活下去呢？那全靠副業爾補。但佃田須加租金的一筆支出，換言之，即佃農之收入，又較自耕農爲低。故設定授佃的限額時，以上所舉南通一例，是很有參考價值的。爲維持佃農的最低生活，照南通的情形說來，每人至少須授以二至三畝，每家五口至少須十至十五畝。南通是有工業基礎的，手工紡織更普遍到各郷村，所以南通農民生活一般尙好。徐海情形就不對了，土薄，產量小，副業又遠不及通如淮揚之盛。處理蘇北土地，我認爲不能以一個一成不變的辦法，硬生生地行之於各縣。</p>
<p>復興農村，改良農民生活，單靠制度是不够的，水利，生產技術，交通，金融等等，都有極重大的關係，並且互爲影響。人們以爲只要在制度上加以改革，便可滿足改良農民生活的要求，那未免把問題看得太單純了吧。本篇所討論的不出制度範圍，我更是土地問題的門外漢。不過，我是蘇北人，自然對蘇北特中堅力量　關心，蘇北已發展成一個新局面了，現實不容迴避，因此，不憚爲識者所護，粗率的說出我所要說的話。至於正確的意見辦法，希望專家們快些提出來。</p>

<h3>奴隸的苦痛</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>看「春寒」後</p>
<p>上海實騐劇團這次演出「春寒」，比他第一次演出的「新官上任」有意義得多了。「新官上任」只是寫出了一羣無恥的流氓仗着暴敵的勢力欺侮着老百姓；而這「春寒」却寫出了人心的奸詐和陰險；以及良善的人受環境的誘惑而變成投機取巧；一個未經世故的純潔的女人受不住自己幻想的驅使和外界以榮譽為誘餌，使她做了一場惡夢，險些把自己給完全毀了。</p>
<p>「春寒」深深地掘發人類　惡的性格，使我們不寒而慄；深懼人生道途的坷坎，和陰暗中惡狼毒蛇所設的陷阱，想吞食我們這些良善而又純潔的人們，這是多麽地可怕啊！</p>
<p>我們只要把蒙在「春寒」面上的一層故事揭去，就可發現里面更多的東西，這些東西是無窮盡的，是永存的，也是現社會中常為所見的醜惡的性格，和任何一個陰暗的角落兒多可能發生的陰謀。</p>
<p>「春寒」，「春」天還是「寒」冷的！我的主啊！到那一個季節，你才給我們溫暖呢？</p>
<h3>我所愛的音樂</h3>
<p>— 李慶華</p>
<p>青年作曲家張定和先生於抗戰期間作曲甚多，近由重慶抵滬。聞上海市政府交響樂團及上海市音樂協會將於本月間舉行其個人作品演奏會。僅作此文以為介紹。</p>
<p>我是一個非常固執自己偏愛的人。</p>
<p>我喜歡在冷寂的冬夜裏和朋友作竟夜的攀談，我愛讀短小的抒情詩篇，我喜歡兩三筆的寫意畫，我愛好柴霍甫的戲劇…那末，對音樂我也一樣，我偏愛委婉幽怨的小提琴獨奏和如泣如訴的短歌。</p>
<p>其實，我對音樂，一直到現在，還是和碰見一個陌生人一樣。雖然有許多音樂的知音者以極誠懇的態度給我介紹，但我所能領略到的，僅僅是一點風貌。在聽音樂時，我雖然也會做出像是知音一樣的閉着眼睛去欣賞，但也只是偶而的有幾個片段能够溶化到自己心的領域裏面去。</p>
<p>我記得我和音樂結緣的媒介是賀綠汀的「牧童短笛」。那時候我在一個被青山環繞的小城裏讀書。走出校門便是農舍牧場。課餘之暇，學校的週圍，便是我們精神憩息的場所。有一天學校裏開音樂會——那是閉塞的小城裏僅有的一次——，全部的節目裏我所能接受的，就是「牧童短笛」了。因為當這支曲子在彈奏的時候，我覺得我的心情就好像是散步在校外的田亘上。直到今天，我每想到了這個曲子，在我眼前使顯現了那學校週圍的景色。</p>
<p>也許是由於生活環境和習性的養成的吧，我不大喜歡急風驟雨似的大樂章，而喜歡恬靜幽美的小曲。我喜歡溫柔的小提琴曲子，有時候第一個音就會緊緊的扣住了我的心絃。幾分鐘的演唱，能使我作竟日的神往。像這樣的音樂，我有時覺得不是在聽一曲演奏，而像是在聽一個少女抒　他的情懷，或者是　怨的低訴，我不喜歡如火如茶的戀歌，而常常沉醉於情意纏綿的短歌。我不喜歡放聲慟哭的哀輓，而神往於那種此眼綿綿的味道。</p>
<p>所以，在許多作曲家中間，我也偏愛長於寫作抒情短歌的作曲家。在中國名作曲家裏面，黃自先生的作品是我所喜歡的。同時，他的高足張定和先生的曲子也是我所偏愛的。張先生是擅長寫作抒情短歌的，他的曲子的情調，也正是我一向習性所偏愛的情調。</p>
<p>我第一次聽到張定和先生的曲子是「流亡之歌」，那時候也正是「松花江上」普遍流行的時候。也許是由於我當時正處在流亡異鄉的情境之下吧，這兩支歌，差不多整天的掛在我的嘴上。二十八年我從四川唱到陝西，二十九年我又從陝西唱回四川，「……往事如烟，家山如夢，何處是歸程？一般新月，兩樣情懷，遊子倍傷心……」這幾句平日給我添了許多悵望和辛酸，也給我許多懷念和慰藉。</p>
<p>郭沫若先生的「棠棣之花」在重慶初次的上演，得到了意外的成功。劇本裏那種濃郁的情節，當然是觀衆所喜歡的。但是張定和先生的好幾支插曲，也可以說是促使演出成功的主要因素。想在當年看過在抗建堂演出的人們，一定都會有同感。那些插曲，充份的表現出全劇的情緒和氣氛。在中國，戲劇插曲的優秀作家已經很少，而張先生在這一方面不僅是一個優秀的作家，並且他還曾經大量的為很多的戲劇作過插曲。除了「棠棣之花」外，「大雷雨」「正氣歌」「岳飛」「以身作則」「邊城故事」以及許多劇本的插曲，在後方都非常普遍的流行。連四五歲的小孩子們都歡喜唱。在戲劇插曲製作上，張先生的功績是不可磨滅的。可惜近年來他很少為戲劇作曲了。引為遺憾的，也許不只是我一個人吧！</p>
<p>好了，也用不着我多作介紹了，好在張先生的曲子在後方是大家都熟悉的，喜歡他曲子的人很多很多。在上海方面，對張先生許是很陌生，但不允以後，他必將成為大家所熟悉的作曲家。</p>
<p>我不是一個知音的人，我更不慣於拿什麽理論來衡量一切的。我喜歡說說我個人的愛好，尤其喜歡固執於自己的偏愛。在張先生的作品將要演出的今天，希望有幾個和我一樣偏愛他的曲子的人。</p>

<h3>流行的西部片　介紹三張最優美的作品</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>近年來好萊塢的西部史實片，頗受人歡迎，因此各公司亦就盡量地攝製着，以應衆望。又如共和公司竟以西部片為主要的出品。牠們叫座的力量也並不稍遜於歌舞片，神話宮開片等。因為在每一張西部片中，總是有一位蓋世的英雄和驚險的劍擊，槍擊，拳擊，偉大的戰爭場面等，這些都是一般兒童，少年，青年所最羡慕而歡喜的。所以好萊塢各公司因西部片的賣座驚人，就不惜鉅資傾力以赴，爭相拍攝。今年已有許多的西部片相繼完成，茲擇三張最完滿，最優美的介紹於後：</p>
<p>（一）聖安東尼“San　Antonio”由埃洛爾茀林主演，他的演技，嬌捷的騎術，綪嫻的劍法和槍法，都是我們所熟知而早經膾炙人口。女主角不是老搭擋奧麗薇哈佛蘭，而是新星安麗克絲史蜜斯。全片　爛的五彩，華納公司出品</p>
<p>（二）雙槍獨行俠“Virginian”從小說家奧文惠斯脫（Ower　Wiser）的名著改編而成，佐麥克利主演，他的片子，我們暌違已久，在此片中有極好的演出。其他有桑尼德甫，白立恩唐拉凡等合演「真女恨」中的白蓓蘭勃立頓担任女主角。半夜裏牛羣的奔竄，日落後亡命之徒的馳騁充滿在本片彩色的鏡頭中，是一張極有價值的巨片派拉蒙公司出品</p>
<p>（三）倔强的斯摩蓋“Smoky”這是二十年前，威爾詹姆士（Witll　James）寫成了一個西部故事，其中描寫着一隻難馴服的，倔强的馬名叫斯摩蓋。現在二十世紀福斯公司把牠攝製成一個美麗的，動人的五彩西部片，由茀萊麥高茂萊，安裴絲德分任男女主角。</p>
<h3>「忠義之家」</h3>
<p>— 迂夫</p>
<p>由中央電影攝影場第二廠攝製，吳永剛編導的「忠義之家」於五日上午招待新聞文化界之後，各報劇刋上對該片的意見和批評頗有出入。更可笑的是有位批評人提出意見要在朴振東和華辛佩萱（嚴肅和秦怡演）之間加一點故事。這所謂「故事」不知是指什麽？未知是根據性格呢？還是根據情節？若是照美國電影的作風加「故事」那到很有意思，是不是？</p>
<p>任何一個作品都必須經過批評，否則，它的藝術價值無法為人所評定和知道。</p>
<p>任何一個藝術工作者都必須經得起批評；同時，任何一個批評人的態度必須是善意的，觀點必須是正確的。假使批評人存有惡意的態度和灣曲的觀點，那麼，他是否還想要人家來接受他的批評和他的意見呢？這是一件很明顯的事吧！</p>
<h3>好萊塢的遠東市場</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>戰爭結束以後，好萊塢各影片公司，就盡其全力，使電影事業得在迅速之間，恢復常態。一方面羅致人材，趕拍新片；另方面注意海外市場，如何推廣？故一年來曾先後派員往海外各地考察戰後的電影事業，有何變動？以作推廣市場的參考。遠東方面，美片的最大市場，當推上海，香港，新加坡，馬尼拉諸地，故大公司中，如派拉蒙，米高梅，華納，二十世紀，福斯等皆曾派員東來，調查一切，互爭雄長。</p>
<p>過去一年，好萊塢影片公司在遠東方面的營業競爭，的確相當劇烈。光就上海來說，他們運來的影片，大都為佳構，如一九四四年及一九四五年出品，獲得電影藝術科學研究院金像獎者，亦已先後運來公映。就我們所看到的好萊塢影片，其中舊片固然也不少，但全是較好的出品。而上海各電影院，近來映片之期，每比戰前為長，凡是鉅片，會公映幾星期之久。大約此種傾向，今後一年，將繼續保持，不致變化。</p>
<p>不僅遠東，戰爭結束以後世界各大都市，電影事業都有高度的發展。照此情形，好萊塢的影片公司非增加量不可，因為一般都市，非但影院比戰前多了，就是觀衆，也比往日熱鬧。可是相反的好萊塢的影片公司，一年來所製影片，比戰前為少，祇是質的方面，已一致提高。不拘演員陣容，置景，攝影，以及剪接等各方面，都有進步。這當然也是使一部新片能够一連公映幾個星期之久的唯一原因。</p>
<h3>談「天蟾」的京角兒</h3>
<p>— 馮長</p>
<p>天蟾舞台經過幾次三翻，才把京角兒胡少安請到南方來。他在天蟾的第一天打泡戲是「四郎探母」，名字的介紹還放在張雲溪之先，這一下可使我們上海人眼花了，猜不透他究竟是個什麽樣兒，於是胡少安就給戲迷注意了。</p>
<p>這個注意是不久的，連聽了他幾次戲，葫蘆裏賣的藥也就給拆穿，胡少安簡直比王鐵俠都不如。</p>
<p>北方到上海來倒霉的老生，遠期的不算，近斯的如沙世鑫·王文源·郭春陽·徐東明和王鐵俠等，他們都是沒有嗓子而得不到上海人的歡迎，結果很不得意地回去了。</p>
<p>沙世鑫曾在台上漏了唱句，而向觀衆打恭作揖，當然是倒好。</p>
<p>王文源曾唱過李陵碑的老令公不帶磸碑，那是因為荀　生要上場了，催他早些下去，而觀衆對他草草結束並不想退票。</p>
<p>郭春陽挑了一天大樑，因倒嗓不能再挑，於是給紀玉良一個竄的機會。</p>
<p>徐東明挑樑比郭春陽略好，但大半却靠着周維俊在「八大鎚」中陸文龍開打。</p>
<p>王鐵俠，那是不久的事，扮相台風都佳，有人稱之謂「西風老生」，唱的又無韻味，觀衆對他都搖頭，說他是最沒出息的老生。</p>
<p>這一次胡少安來了，每個人的預料他總比王鐵俠好，但是在事實上適得其反，胡少安是不及王鐵俠。在扮相，兩人同病相憐。在嗓子，王鐵俠雖不行，但前後還一致，而胡少安則陰陽兩嗓，高的時候可以比擬宋保羅，但只是隨時地高一句，以後所接下去的必定低得可憐，甚至同台唱戲的人都聽不見，低的當然要占百分之九十以上。在武功，鬆得可憐。運腔，無論你怎麼樣，用這種嗓子是不會受歡迎的。所以我說厄運不久就會加到胡少安頭上的。</p>

<h3>戀愛的故事</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>周學詩把年輕的舅父認做最好的朋友。舅父時常替他解釋課本裏的疑難，又敎他作各種簡易有趣的）游戲。學詩最喜歡的一種是：任憑舅父將他拋上空中，然後讓他落在舅父的手掌裏。他從不思量這一個游戲帶有多少驚險，他信任這一雙强壯的手臂，正如他對舅父的愛一樣深。</p>
<p>放學蹄家，學詩把畫包拋在椅子上面，高聲嚷着：「舅舅！舅舅！」他準備繼續昨夜未盡興的那一個頑意兒。</p>
<p>平日他很容易得到那一個粗宏的答應聲，可是今天，他一連喚了三四次，依舊沒有回答。舅父這個時候絕少出街的，懷着訝異的心情，他走入舅父的臥室。</p>
<p>學詩恰好望見舅舅的背影，他獨自坐在一張有靠背的椅子上，伸着右臂，手掌好像握着一件小巧的物件，是翠白兩色，發出光彩，舅父似乎正以全神凝視着它，竟沒有察覺背後的脚步聲。等到外甥走到面前，他趕緊把右手掌捏成拳頭，放入衣袋裏。</p>
<p>「舅舅，剛才怎麼不答應我，我們到外邊玩一會，好嗎？」</p>
<p>兩個兒，一個是二十八歲的少年，一個是九歲的童子，一同來到庭院中。要了一些新鮮的遊戲，學詩便又嚷着要舅父做那一個把他拋上空中的頑意。</p>
<p>一次，兩次……學詩的身體升起在空中，超過舅父的頭頃，有一次竟有齊二層樓那般高。他們玩得高興，誰也不覺疲倦。</p>
<p>猛然有一件光瑩玲瓏的東西，從舅父的衣袋裏跌落地面，拍的一聲，水門汀的地上躺着一隻翠白相間的玉雁，一隻翼翅跌碎了。</p>
<p>舅舅臉上登時露出張惶失措的神情，當學詩的身體由半空落下來，他方才記起趕怏用手去接，險些兒便要偏失，學詩心裏想道：這可以算做危險的一遭游戲。</p>
<p>學詩還未站穩脚步，眼見舅父急忙奔過去，將那破碎了的物件，珍惜地檢在手中，他的目光中呈現出一種凄愴的表情。</p>
<p>史文　和鄧國礎是知己期友，旣同在一所百貨公司任職，兩人的臥室也恰在一間，朝夕見面</p>
<p>有一天，鄧國礎起牀時候，忽然在房門口拾到一隻指頭大小的玉雁，除了兩翼是碧綠色，其餘潔白似雪，纖巧可愛，他因爲不知道是誰失落的，便將它暫爲保　。還未走出房門，却見史文耀焦灼氣急地奔入來，劈頭就問：「老鄧，看見過一隻玉做的雁嗎？我把它落掉了。」</p>
<p>「沒有看到，喂，一隻小小的玉雁有什麽希奇，落掉就算了，値得這樣發急？」</p>
<p>「照這樣講，你一定見到我的玉雁了，請還給我，快上班啦。」</p>
<p>「是你的Sweetheart送給你的？」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「你不肯回答就不用想找到它。」</p>
<p>「老鄧，那末我祇好告訴你：Yes。請你快還給我」。</p>
<p>「不行！你得要把她的照片給我見一眼。」</p>
<p>「她沒有給我相片。」</p>
<p>「別扯謊，我告訴你：我也不曾看見什麽玉雁什麽麻雀。」</p>
<p>史文耀知道多說無益，從床下的箱子裏取出一只信封，抽出裏面放着的一張照片，　給他的同伴。</p>
<p>「小史，你真會開玩笑，這一對姐妹花究竟是新進的電影明星還是你的妹子？」</p>
<p>「別胡說！照片裏矮小一點的那一個就是我的女友雁翎，其餘的一個是她的姐姐。</p>
<p>「小史，你的艷福真不淺。喂，她姐姐的名字喚什麽？」</p>
<p>「雁屏。」</p>
<p>「好漂亮的名字，喂…唔唔……」</p>
<p>倘若那一張照片不是四寸而是八寸的話，史文耀也許會察覺老鄧正在全神貫注在雁屏的面目。</p>
<p>「喂，小史，你可知道雁屏出嫁不曾？」</p>
<p>「這個，你問來幹什麽？我也不大淸楚，論年紀她應該嫁人了，但是我始終沒有看見她和任何一個男子往來，她連一個男朋友都沒有。」</p>
<p>「好極！」老鄧有點得意忘形：「小史，你介紹我認識她，我願意做她的男友。」</p>
<p>習久相處，史文耀知道老鄧的爲人，他的確樂意爲他成全。</p>
<p>鄧國楚記得那一天的日期：三十四年九月六日，是他生命史上最愉快的一頁。</p>
<p>初秋氣候，公園景色格外宜人，史文耀和鄧國楚在黄昏時候米到虹口公園，那一對姐妹花已先應約而至，史文耀含笑向雁翎招呼，大家走近一處。</p>
<p>「這位是我的同事鄧先生，這位是江雁屏小姐，這位是雁翎小姐。」小史給他們一一介紹。</p>
<p>兩對男女，坐在草塲上，交換每一句發自心胸中的說話。天際晚霞遙遙在望，秋蟲鳴聲時斷時續，鄧國楚但覺眼前的一切，盡是美！美！美！</p>
<p>那一次見面之後，他們不時相約園遊，以四個人同行時候爲多，老鄧曾單獨邀雁屏出遊，但是她應約到來，身旁必定偕同她的妹妹，好容易候到一次，雁屏獨自應邀，老鄧以爲是一個機會，他引她到一處比較僻靜的地方，並坐談話。他對她傾訴了許多仰慕的言詞，都給她用巧妙的方法，將話鋒轉移開去。</p>
<p>在另一次單獨會面中，老鄧想到一個計策，可是臨時變計，不敢實行。</p>
<p>「雁屏，請把你眼睛閉上，我變一個戲法給你看。」</p>
<p>他本來預備趁勢偷吻她，他的耳根發熱，心臟跳動得很厲害，他見她已經閉上眼睛，他還不敢舉動。她又張開眼，訝異地問：「你究竟變的什麽戲法，變了沒有？」</p>
<p>「未曾，快！請閉上眼，立刻就要變了。」他惶急的神態，絕非文字所能描繪。</p>
<p>他準備不顧一切，忽然遠遠地有一位老頭子走過來，總算他情急智生，趕快摘了一朶花，送到她的鼻孔下面。</p>
<p>她嗅到一陣花香，睜開眼來，看見老鄧滿頭大汗，手中持着一朵白蘭花，他伸長手臂，那朶花還抵着她的鼻孔。「哦，這就是變戲法。」</p>
<p>史文耀告訴老鄧：過幾天他便和江雁翎訂婚了，請他替他照料一應瑣碎的禮節事務。老鄧心裏一面替友人快樂，一面又爲自已思慮：他曾屢次向雁屏暗示他的愛情，可是她從來不表示什麽。他決意打破這一個苦悶。</p>
<p>訂婚宴罷，賓客散去，熱閙喧嘩的廣堂，頓時寂靜無聲。幾個兒女親家忙着替客人喚車爾歸家，史文耀被人勸醉了，雁屏獨坐在冷落的一角彷彿如有悠觸，鄧國礎趁機會走過去。</p>
<p>「雁屏，請閉上眼睛，我有一個很好玩的戲法變給你看。」</p>
<p>她果眞把眼合攏，他不再購躇，借了幾兩酒的力量，較起勇氣，他吻着她的面頰，吻着她的樱唇。</p>
<p>劈拍兩聲，老鄧的臉上左右分享了一下巴掌。動手打人的雁屏面色鐵靑，可是她雖然嘴唇鼓動，好一會沒說出聲音，有幾滴紅豆般大小的淚珠，從她的眼眶中落下來。</p>
<p>老鄧忍氣吞聲地走開了。</p>
<p>以後，他們雖然見面，彼此都不說話，也不招呼。經過整整兩個月，有一次，小史，老鄧，江家姐妹凑巧又在公園相値。雁翎和小史談得高興，手牽手的走開去，撇下老鄧和雁屏，相對無語。</p>
<p>沈默了許久，老鄧忍不住開口：</p>
<p>「雁屏，那天是我的過錯，我喝酒太多了，我現在向你道歉。」</p>
<p>「也許過失在我。但是我的錯誤不在今日，兩年以前，我知道犯了大錯……」她說到這裏，失聲慟哭起來。</p>
<p>「是我不好，雁屏，這些小事忘了就罷，用不到如此的。」</p>
<p>「你不知道，我哭的原因；……爲了我上了人家的當！嗯……嗚……」觸起舊日傷心事，她益發淚如泉湧，放聲大哭了。</p>
<p>「你上了誰的當？我替你復仇！不用哭，大家來商量。」</p>
<p>老鄧聽她一邊哭一邊訴述，她的每一句話是一柄利刃，他的心也給刺得創傷碎裂了。他氣憤到說不出聲音。</p>
<p>「所以，老鄧，我此刻一見了男人就痛恨，就害怕，舊日的創傷使我失却活下去的勇氣。他害得我好苦，簡直無可訴說的苦，他起先也是向我獻殷勤。設願立誓說愛我，等到我失身於他，……這種人，上帝爲什麼不令他早死，他活在世上一天，我的痛苦和一個無形的桎梏就永不能解除，聽說他巳經和一個有錢的小姐同居了，我時常替那一個不知姓名的小姐担心，她的命運是不是遲早會變成我一樣？」</p>
<p>老鄧仍舊說不出話。臨別前，他向她索取一件可資紀念的物件。雁屏慷慨地從頭頸中解下來一枚鮮瑩晶潔的玉雁親手還給他，並且告訴他這是亡母遺贈的物品，本是一對的，姐妹分取其一，她預備離開上海，到外埠的一家修道院，了此殘生，這一枚玉雁，見物如見人，留作一番友情的紀念。</p>
<p>鄧國礎捧着那一隻碎了的玉雁，追懷舊事，時隔兩年，人事全非，雁翎已經育有兒女，而雁屏音訊不聞，地角天涯，不知寄身何處？</p>
<p>「舅舅，你爲什麼哭？」</p>
<p>聽到無知童子的呼聲，他祇好止住熱淚，將那碎了的雁，小心地用手帕裹起來，放入懷中，嘴裏不住輕喚：</p>
<p>「雁屏，雁屏，祝你無恙！祝你無恙！」</p>
<h3>初犯（世界名畫選載）</h3>
<p>— 成璐</p>
<p>斯丹萊夫人作　倫敦塔特畫廊藏</p>
<p>斯丹萊夫人（Lady　Stanley）自己是一個藝術家，他的丈夫，是一位偉大的探險家。</p>
<p>他的藝術生活開始得很早，因爲在她開始學習讀書和寫字之前，她已在學習作畫了。她所受到的訓練是極優秀的。她最初和鮑特爾，及里格羅斯爵士學習，後來又在巴黎從海納爾學畫，她在巴黎過了三個冬天。</p>
<p>她所繪關於街頭乞丐，海洋女神，和山林女神諸作品，是倫敦畫展的一大特點。同時她的黑白畫，在雜誌界中，也極受歡迎。</p>
<p>「初犯」刻畫深刻，一八九六年陳列於新畫廊後爲塔特爵士購去，並請斯夫人，再繪些襤褸兒童的　稿。</p>
<h3>殘暉</h3>
<p>— 米理惺</p>
<p>爲紀念Mozart所作「詩曲」之一：</p>
<p>Divertismento　17eme　en　Re　Mineur</p>
<p>（Divertismento　No.　17　in　D　Minor）寫</p>
<p>一世紀又半以來，Franz　Subert所遺留給我們這一輩後代的名著中，除掉那最淺近的Ave　Maria（聖母頌）以及那連他自己都以爲「再也沒有創造力繼續寫下去」的Symphonie　Lnachevee（交響第八號「Ｂ調未完成」交響曲）而外，又有多少後代的「知音們」，會去了解他所精心結構超出這兩曲一類的千萬倍而竟不爲一般人所注意抑且敬仰的兩支，“Ｃ”調大傑作—可是在一世紀又半的過程中，我們的　Subert　却已由這兩支“Ｃ”調傑作的遺音，自Hydan　Mozart　Beethoven三位一體以降，能也無可否認他不是一個集H,M,B,大成的唯一的大思想家而兼有創造力的大作曲家的。</p>
<p>在他一生　厄困窘的生命史上最後的三個寒署裏，由於迷戀而反覆咀嚼這一章Mozart「詩曲」，（Divertismento　Poetlq　ue）所得的「靈感」，終在一八二四年的初秋先後完成了這兩支“Ｃ”調的傑作，（A）就是：QuinttetoⅢ　eme　en　do　Majeur　（Quintteto　No.　3　in　C　Major）（B）就是：Sympi.onie　5　eme,　en　do　Majeur,（Symphony　No.　5　in　C　Major），前者是叙述他一己對於Mozart　的欽仰而發，後者却帶着懷疑的情緒顯露　渣的「詩曲」非出自他的手筆而得之於上帝的神力，兩曲“Ｃ”　總和的啓示；我們大胆的　Subert　好像在不折不扣的質問着上帝：「上帝！你爲什麽創造了他——　渣——而累了我　　後生小子、嘔盡了　　，也可說以是畢生的心　！</p>
<p>但是這在人類的輝煌的藝術史裏，從此多滲入了兩支“Ｃ”調的大傑作，是上蒼的賦予？抑是塵渣的「詩曲」？</p>
<p>Divertismento　No.　17　in　D　Minor，即Divertismento　Poetique　是塵渣一七八七年在維也納附近的一個小村Rientz中寫或，全曲共分四節：</p>
<p>Ⅰer　Mouvement　Allegro</p>
<p>Ⅱeme　Mouvement　Adagio</p>
<p>Ⅲeme　Mouvement　Minueto</p>
<p>Ⅶeme　Mouvement　Presto</p>
<p>其主旨完全爲思念亡故不久的恩師約　佛罕登（JosephHydan）而寫，全曲從頭到尾，無一音不竭盡盡露其稚子之思，無一刻不表示其正在懷人死或可能返魂的遐想，但在第三節而後方始覺悟肉體雖死精神不滅的後死者固有的慰藉，終在末了的一節裏，註下了如後的「哲語」，加重了人生渺茫的慨嘆，積極地用“Presto”把過去以及將來他人所未能寫的都一口氣把它傾吐完了，這就是今天「殘暉」的詩曲。</p>
<p>「當年在今天相同的夕陽裏，他那慈祥的臉龐，　着那循循不倦的顔色，論樂的往事，一切都宛在目前，可是今天舊地重游，林木依然，而那只可遐想的先人，却一地長眠，碧苔永盡，生命的短促，佇立在夕陽的殘暉裏，欲訴無語，無語，無語，無語在今天的殘暉裏。</p>

<h3>推荐「春寒」</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>話劇的演出，勝利後也從未中斷過，每天至少有一個劇團在上演，有時甚至兩三個，戲劇工作者的努力，大家有目共睹的了，可是在售座紀錄上，却遠非勝利所能比，因此，許多劇團不是弄得虧累不堪，就是不敢輕於嘗試。</p>
<p>這種不景氣的現象，仔細分析起來，大概在外國影片的大量沏入與上海人的趣味兩種原因所造成。不關票價高低問題，也不完全由於一般人嗜好低級趣味問題。如果這個分析是正確的話，上海劇運前途頗值得憂慮的了。</p>
<p>據說勝利後話劇的演出，祇有兩個戲謙了錢，一個是「陞官圖」，一個是「萬世師表」，其餘的演出，無一不蝕本，僅僅是虧的大小而已。一　戲的好壞，本來並不能用售座多寡作標準，尤其在中國，即使許多外國影片也難例外，一個劇團不同於一　商店的，至少在目前，大多數的劇團還是藝術性超過於營業性，所以，賺錢並不一定是劇團的目的。然而正因為劇團不是一個牟利性的組織，它的正常而合理的開支，必須獲得解決，否則，它將無法繼續工作下去，倘使再賠貼，那更不堪設想了。</p>
<p>在這種情况之下，許多劇團於是走上生意經這條路子，這也難怪：這自然不是一個合理的辦法，話劇界的朋友是應該積極研討而尋求一個正當路徑的，因為長此以往，我們不難想像至它的未來面目。</p>
<p>昨天起，宋之的編劇，洪深導演的「春寒」，在蘭心戲院上演了，作為觀衆之一，我願意負責向我的讀者推荐這個演出，我敢保證這是勝利後在上海的幾個少數的好的演出之一，如果你是真在欣賞劇藝，這個演出，你是不應該錯過的。編劇者的風趣，導演的謹嚴，演員的修養，可以說都屬於第一流。</p>
<p>戲劇工作者當知奮鬥圖生，奮鬥以求工作之繼續，但他們更需要我們觀衆的合作，給他們勇氣，給他們鼓勵，我們大家去看，就能達到上述目的，看了之後，批評如何，那又是另一回事。</p>
<p>天下最令人傷心的事是不理不睬，是冷落，我們能用這樣殘酷的方式接待這一羣有崇高理想和熱情的辛勤艱苦的戲劇工作者嗎？</p>
<p>所以，在這裏，我更願意推荐「春寒」</p>
<h3>公事包的故事</h3>
<p>— 傳聞者</p>
<p>但願這是一個荒唐無稽的齊東野語吧！昨天，從一個朋友的口頭，聽到了下面的一則新聞：</p>
<p>二十世紀的五十年代，A洲的C國都城中，某辦公廳裏有一位少將參議，每天早晨由公館挾着一個　塌塌的大皮包去上辦公，每天傍晚由辦公廳挾着一個胖胖的大皮包回家，自然皮包仍是原來的那只，不過胖了就是。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，三天，…好幾天過去，似乎從來沒一天例外，担任門崗的憲兵同志，天天都看在眼裏，起初，以為是辦不了的公事，拿回家裏去辦，可是日子一久，老是看見瘦皮包挾進，胖皮包挾出，只有拿出，沒見拿回，未免有些疑心，為着責職攸關，終於在一個下辦公的傍晚，他們發動了攻擊。</p>
<p>照例地，參議爺又挾着胖皮包出來了。</p>
<p>「立正！敬禮！」憲兵同志們沒敢疏忽禮節。</p>
<p>參議爺熟練地舉一舉右手，回過了禮，在脚正踏上門口第一級階石時，那兩位門崗憲兵中的一名，又恭敬地叫了起來：</p>
<p>「報告參議！我們奉命要看着參議的皮包，」</p>
<p>這可不成，一個少將參議的公事皮包，豈能輕易讓人檢查的，為了保持應有的尊嚴，他以「機密」的理由，拒絕了他們的要求，可是憲兵同志也不肯輕易放鬆，進一步向他報告了「奉命看看」的理由，使他再沒法拒絕了，這怎麼辦呢？幾十年的奮鬥史，歷代相傳的清白家風，平生清介自守的令　，…全部都將斷送在這一回了，…心房變成了白蟻窠，成千成百的白蟻在裏面蠕動着，不過面上始終還保持着鎮靜和威儀，靈機一動，到底讓他想到了對策。</p>
<p>「要看可以，但得去主任面前開看。否則不行。」</p>
<p>於是，由一個憲兵眼着我們的參議爺，去到主任辦公室，還好，主任尚不曾走，他們的爭執有了解決希望。</p>
<p>進了主任室之後，照例行禮致敬纔畢參議爺趁憲兵還未報告以前，先發制人地開口了：</p>
<p>「報告主任！他要查我的皮包，我因為家裏人多，每月十萬元錢不够開支，所以每天把公家吃剩了的飯，……」</p>
<p>說到這裏，勿然眼眶一酸，淚水突眶而出，喉頭好像被塞了—團棉花似的抽咽起來，再沒法往下說，他忘記了自己少將參議的地位，却像一個受了別人欺辱回來，在母氣懷中訴苦的孩子似的抽泣起來了。主任摸不清是怎麼回事，還以為他發了神經錯亂症。經過憲兵同志的一翻報告，主任才從他手中拿過皮包來，打開一看，但見白紙包裏滾出來的全是些白而軟的冷飯珠，聰明的主任，立刻明白了一切，揮揮手，叫憲兵退去。……</p>
<p>明天，我們的參議爺在辦公室裏接到一張會計處的通知書，大意是奉主任諭，×參議辦事勤奮，操守清高着即每月特發津貼法幣五萬元，希即備據來室領取本月份津貼為荷。</p>
<p>故事到了這裏，是宣告大團園了，最近聽說C國當局，鑒於全國袍澤待遇過於菲薄，自本年七月份起，已將各級俸薪提高一倍左右，一個上將月入是二十五萬元，較我們上海每月拿五十元底薪的工人們，已可毫無愧色了，致於那位參議爺近况怎樣？倒不曾聽說，我謹祝他全家衣食無憂吧！</p>
<h3>五分鐘戀愛</h3>
<p>— 承連</p>
<p>薄暮，我行走在靜安寺路畔。</p>
<p>一個U.S.N的水兵彳亍在不遠的前面。</p>
<p>輕風吹來一陣濃郁的香味，一個穿着奇異服裝的姑娘，扭着腰肢，跨着微快的步子，從後面趕上去。她走得那樣的不習慣，顯然是因為高跟鞋太高了。</p>
<p>「哈囉，她靠近了他，輕聲地招呼着。</p>
<p>他向她看了一眼，繼續走　。</p>
<p>「Where　are　you　goin　」她傍他，更近些。</p>
<p>他仍舊向她望望，並給她一個微笑。</p>
<p>她還答他一個媚眼。</p>
<p>她打開玻璃皮包，掏出二支捲烟，一支遞給他。</p>
<p>他從依袋裏拿出了打火機。</p>
<p>「Thank　you，」他接了她的烟。</p>
<p>「Thank　you，」他為她燃火。</p>
<p>他們吸着捲烟。她的手挽着他的手，他的手也挽着他的手。</p>
<p>他們的話語是更低了，低低地傾訴着。</p>
<p>她指點着路旁電影院的廣告牌，在向他說些什麽，他點着頭。</p>
<p>層層的夜色蓋上來，霓虹燈　着胘人的眼。</p>
<p>她倚偎得他更緊些，消失在無過的黑暗裏。</p>
<p>只是五分鐘哪！他們的戀愛已經成熟，或將有更深切的關係吧！</p>
<h3>對白</h3>
<p>— 昆銘</p>
<p>坐車者：天這麽熱，真難過。</p>
<p>拉車者：天是應該熱熱的。</p>
<p>坐車者：你這算什麽話？</p>
<p>拉車者：上兩個月下了那麼許多雨，田裏的稻也浸壞了，假使天不熱，不是更不行了嗎？</p>
<p>坐車者：可是天熱到底有點不舒服。</p>
<p>拉車者：莊稼人可高興了啊！因為田可以慢慢好起來。</p>
<p>坐車者：這干我什麽事？</p>
<p>拉車者：啊喲！先生，你總要吃飯的啊！</p>
<p>坐車者：吃飯？哼！我有錢還怕買不到米？</p>
<p>拉車者：可是錢又不可以當飯吃。</p>
<p>坐車者：少說廢話，快拉，快拉，我還有事呢。</p>
<p>拉車者：唉！上面晒着，下面燙着，先生，你真不知道我們拉車的苦處呵！</p>
<p>坐車者：那麼誰教你拉車的？</p>
<p>拉車者：咦！誰教你坐車的，如果沒有坐車的，我們也不會拉車了。</p>
<p>坐車者：他媽的，碰着你這個多話的傢伙。現在當局要實行淘汰人力車了，三年後，看你們怎麼辦嘞！</p>
<p>拉車者：三年後，先生，你在三年後能坐得到汽車嗎？</p>
<h3>學校圈內</h3>
<p>如果扶梯上面立着一羣女生在談天，那麼一個男生走上來時，必定會很斯文的側身而過。反之，一羣男生立在一處，一個女生走過的時候，也是如此。這也可說是目下學生公認的定理一般。</p>
<p>高中有普商二科的，那麼在整個上說起來，普商必定是對立的。往往商科舉辦一件事，那普科就絕不會再參加。更有商科組織了一個什麽會，普科大加以破壞的。在在均可見普商之不合作。目前在上海有商科的學校，差不多皆是如此。普商真正能聯絡得融融洽洽的，可說是極稀少的事。</p>
<h3>去年今日</h3>
<p>— 佐萋</p>
<p>去年今日，在上海，早晨六時左右，我接到朋友的電話，說：</p>
<p>「昨夜東京廣播，日本已向聯合國無條件投降了。」</p>
<p>「噢，真的嗎？」我帶着驚奇，興奮，和一半懷疑的口吻問。</p>
<p>接着又接到十幾次電話，親戚和朋友都告訴這件事，有幾位祗說「你知道昨夜的事嗎？」我忙回說「知道，知道。」大家都心照不宣，怕遭守在電話局中的日憲監「聽」。</p>
<p>市民掩不住興奮的性情，忘了這一件可能是謠言的傳說，全市竟日響起爆竹聲，還添了兩個奇特的節目：賽球——一部份市民圍住日僑，將他們的帽子搶下來，將它當籃球似的擲來擲去；打靶子——將西瓜皮擲向疾行而過的日本軍用卡車。</p>
<p>晚上，敵偽脅迫下的「防空態勢」已無形解除，市民都換上高支光的燈泡，防空燈罩擲在一邊，上海又成不夜之城。</p>
<p>無綫電中再度響起雄壯的歌聲，「起來，不願做奴隸的人們！」</p>

<p>父：小鬼！</p>
<p>子：什麽？罵人！</p>
<p>父：為什麽你抽烟？</p>
<p>子：我愛國！</p>
<p>父：抽烟愛國？誰同你說的？</p>
<p>子：報上不是說洋烟傾消，國貨查烟沒有人抽嗎？國貨沒人抽，工廠就要關門，中國的前途不是要因為工業破產而大受影響嗎？所以我拼命學抽烟，看！這包香烟不是國貨嗎？</p>
<p>你：嗯！</p>

<h3>Joint Statement by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Elaborates on the Core Issues of the Current Situation; Agreement Difficult to Reach Between the Government and the CCP</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] Special Envoy Marshall invited Ambassador Stuart and Zhou Enlai to his residence at 10:30 AM today for discussions, continuing to exchange views on key issues. Zhou Enlai also indicated his rejection of Chairman Chiang's proposals. It is understood that Chairman Chiang's proposals require the Communist forces to withdraw from five areas—northern Jiangsu, Rehe, the Jiaoji Railway, Shanxi, and the Northeast—and relinquish their local administrative authority. Zhou Enlai returned to Meiyuan New Village at 12:30 PM. Ambassador Stuart remained at the residence, having lunch with General Marshall, and they decided to issue a written statement in the afternoon. At 5:15 PM, Yu Da-wei visited General Marshall, engaging in conversation for an hour before departing at 6:15 PM. It is also reported that Ambassador Stuart will travel to Beiping next week to attend to university affairs at Yenching University.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] It is rumored that Marshall is ill and will come here from Nanjing tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The United States Information Service released a statement by US Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, and Ambassador to China, Stuart, regarding the current situation in China, as follows: "General Marshall and Dr. Stuart have been jointly exploring various possible ways to end the increasingly widespread conflict in China and begin the initial steps towards developing a truly democratic government. A peaceful resolution of all political problems is, in fact, the unanimous desire of all Chinese people. Regarding the economic situation, a political solution must be sought immediately to avoid a disastrous collapse. The scope of the war is expanding, threatening to engulf the entire country in warfare beyond the control of those responsible. Leaders on both sides of the government and the Communist Party desire to end the war, but certain problems awaiting resolution have thus far made agreement difficult to reach. Both sides seem unable to find a method for resolving these issues, thereby enabling the issuance of a nationwide ceasefire order. Among these unresolved problems, some relate to the redeployment of troops. However, a more fundamental question remains: after the redeployment of troops, what should be the nature of the local governments in these evacuated areas before the National Assembly makes fundamental decisions? This question is more difficult to resolve than the redeployment of troops."</p>
<p>Military Reorganization and Garrison Area Issues – CCP Has Shown No Sincerity to Date (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th) After General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued their statement, a reporter interviewed an observer to solicit their opinion. According to the observer, "The statement by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart explains the general situation and the results of their efforts and consultations over the past month, making it clear to the public where the crux of the current situation lies. We deeply admire the hard work and sincerity of the two gentlemen. The last paragraph, concerning the difficulty of military reorganization and garrison locations, as well as the CCP's demand to retain its civil administrative organs after withdrawing troops from certain areas in the future, highlights truly important issues. The CCP's demands may seem superficially reasonable, but a careful analysis reveals their insincerity and complete focus on propaganda. This is obvious. In Europe and America, it is common for the central government to be governed by one party while local governments have governors and mayors from the opposition party. It was not uncommon for communist mayors to be elected in some cities in France before the war, even when the right-wing party was in power. This did not cause major obstacles, because these opposition party local officials still had to abide by national laws and could not make any major changes at will. However, the CCP is different. Wherever its regime reaches, it expels and slaughters local merchants, landlords, and intellectuals, abolishes all national laws, withholds all tax revenues, and independently issues currency and establishes its own army, essentially forming a completely separate country and undertaking a political and social revolution. If this kind of local government is established everywhere, China will have countless independent countries completely opposed to the central government. Is this the way to peaceful unification? If so, what is the point of discussing peace? Therefore, we must express this point to draw the attention of Chinese and foreign individuals."</p>
<p>A Hopeless Game; A Pessimistic Premonition Pervades Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] After the statement by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart was released this afternoon, the Nationalist side also declined to comment. It is reported that Zhou Enlai stated that the current situation will be more serious than this statement indicates. According to a foreign authority, the negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists are like a game of chess where all the pieces have been captured, leaving only cannons and generals on each side. Although this game is not yet a checkmate, there is no way to move forward. According to someone close to the government, "We are deeply grateful for the hard work and efforts of the Stuart and Marshall in striving for peace. We hope they will not be discouraged. However, we will still rely on our own efforts to achieve peace." Today is the anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance. At this time last year, there was an irrepressible celebration in the wartime capital. This year, the peace negotiations have been declared suspended, and a sense of pessimism pervades the city. Is this not an ominous sign?</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] After Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued their joint statement, many observers here believe that Marshall has discovered that his mission cannot be completed. However, no news has emerged from Marshall's residence indicating that Marshall will abandon his arduous task. It is generally believed that Marshall is now convinced that, given the current state of negotiations between the two sides, peace is unlikely to be achieved. It is currently unknown what consequences the joint statement will bring about.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Important Announcement to Be Released on the 14th; Minister Peng Announced in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Minister of Information Peng Xuepei announced yesterday (the 10th) at a cocktail reception for the local press that Chairman Chiang will release an important announcement on August 14th. Minister Peng, who had just arrived in Shanghai on the 9th, held a cocktail reception for leaders of the press at the Cathay Hotel on the 8th floor at 5 PM yesterday (the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's surrender) to foster camaraderie. Approximately 150 people attended, including presidents, editors-in-chief of local Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies, heads of the press offices of major embassies in Shanghai, and directors of news distribution for agencies such as the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Guests and hosts mingled on the high floor, chatting happily with drinks in hand. The aforementioned important news was announced by Peng at the reception, first in Chinese and then in English. He stated: "The Chairman is scheduled to release an important announcement on the 14th, the content of which will broadly cover: (1) a review of the government's governance in the year since the victory, (2) the current situation, and (3) fiscal and economic policies." Minister Peng continued: "Our financial situation is now gradually improving. The amount of banknotes issued in July did not increase, which is the first time since the war. Tax revenue is steadily increasing, and in recent months, the sale of enemy and puppet properties has generated 30 billion yuan per month for the national treasury. The China Textile Corporation also contributes a net profit of 10 billion yuan to the national treasury each month." Minister Peng had inspected Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan, and all provinces had abundant harvests. Therefore, Minister Peng concluded: "Grain prices in all regions are expected to fall in the future, and production costs can therefore be expected to decrease. However, the biggest difficulty currently lies in the lack of coal. Although the economy and finance have improved, a solution cannot be found because the coal mines in Shandong and other places are still in the hands of the Communist Party. Shanghai currently needs 500,000 tons of coal, relying on the Kailuan Coal Mine to supply 140,000 tons per month and Taiwan to ship 60,000 tons, which is still far from enough. We only hope that the Communist Party can lift the blockade so that our financial and economic situation can improve further." At around 6 PM, Chinese and foreign guests shook hands with Minister Peng to say goodbye and expressed their gratitude for the hospitality.</p>
<h3>Wu Dingchang Arrives in Guling; Zhou Zhirou Returns to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Secretary-General Wu Dingchang of the National Government arrived in Guling at 3:20 PM on the 10th. When asked by reporters about the purpose of his visit, Wu stated that he was summoned by the Chairman and was also responding to the request of the Shanghai business community to address the industrial and commercial crisis. He will report to the Chairman and return to Nanjing in about three to five days.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Chiang Ching-kuo, the Director of Education, arrived in Guling from Nanjing at 4 PM on the 10th, residing at No. 58 Yanghe East Road. Chiang did not use a sedan chair to ascend the mountain, walking the entire way. After a short rest, he was summoned by the Chairman.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Zhou Zhirou came to Guling again on the afternoon of the 9th, met with Chairman Chiang at 8 AM on the 10th to bid farewell, and left Guling for Nanjing at 9 AM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 10th] Chief of General Staff Chen's wife visited Luo Jialun, Cheng Tianfang, He Guoguang, Yao Le, and other doctors at the Xianyan Hotel at 6 PM on the 10th for conversation. Shou Miancheng, Director of the Cooperative Affairs Administration, also arrived in Guling from Nanjing at 5 PM on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Grand Reception at the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing to Celebrate Stuart's New Appointment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The U.S. Embassy hosted a reception this afternoon at 6:30 PM, serving refreshing orange juice cocktails to Chinese and foreign guests to celebrate Dr. Stuart's new appointment. The Ambassador, dressed in a white suit and black bow tie, looked relaxed. The Ambassador himself and the hosts of the reception, the embassy's Counselor Bader and his wife, diligently mingled with the guests. Some guests discussed the statement on the current situation by the Ambassador and General Marshall, but it did not make the atmosphere on the lawn solemn. General Marshall, Yu Da-wei, Zhou Enlai, and others also chatted and laughed. Other guests included Shao Lizi, Chong Xu Kan, Gan Naiguang, Jiang Menglin, Deng Yingchao, and over a hundred envoys from various countries to China.</p>
<h3>External Communication Limited to Within a Hundred Li; Taiyuan Has Become an Isolated City; Communist Forces Increase Troops and Deploy Defenses Around Baoding</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Bureau, 10th] Taiyuan has become an isolated city, with external communication difficult beyond a hundred li. It only reaches Yuci, 60 li to the east, Jinzhong, 50 li to the west, Huangzhai, 69 li to the north, and Jiexiu, in the south. Currently, only China National Aviation Corporation aircraft maintain traffic to Beiping. Fighting is still intense along the Zhengtai Railway, and the railway has been severely damaged by Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Bureau, 10th] Communist forces have increased troops around Baoding. The commander of their First Military District, Yin Tang, has led his troops to deploy defenses southwest of Mancheng. The 31st Brigade, led by Qian Ning, has moved from Shengfang to the northwest of Gaoyang to construct fortifications. Fighting broke out in Zhuoxian on the 9th. Huayuan Xiaobu Village was fiercely attacked by over a thousand troops from Yang Chengwu's Communist forces, and fierce fighting is underway.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces Collapsing on Various Lines in Northern Jiangsu; Nationalist Forces Advance Northward Across Dongtai; Communist Base in Huaiyin Shaken</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] On the 5th of this month, Nationalist forces on the right wing of Northern Jiangsu entered Fuan from Wangjiazhuang, Hai'an. The next day, taking advantage of the momentum, they broke through key positions such as Anfeng, Liangdu, and Sanzhao along the highway at a speed of ten li per hour, attacking into the south gate of Dongtai. Another force occupied Xixi, two li west of Chetai. Communist forces began to retreat northward. Nationalist forces are now advancing northwards in two routes. One route is heading towards Jiancheng along the highway, and the other is advancing westwards along the Bengting River, joining forces with the Nationalist forces at Dadu and Laoge, gradually clearing out the Communist forces west of Dongtai. Then, they will combine forces and head straight for Linze, taking Sisui, cutting off the Huai'an-Xianshui highway and the canal, trapping the Communist forces at Jieshou, Gaoyou, and Shaobo in isolation. The Nationalist forces' strategy is to avoid direct contact with the main force of the Communist forces. Therefore, the Nationalist forces at Xiannv Temple are holding back, waiting for the Nationalist forces in Taixian to encircle northward from Sanlangmiao towards the west, encircling the rear of the Communist forces, and then eliminating the Communist forces south of Sisui in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The Nationalist forces' northern route in Xuzhou has reached Hanzhuang and is advancing rapidly towards Shagou. The eastern route still controls Bayiji. A train from eastern Xuzhou can now reach Daxujia Station. The Nationalist forces in Shuanggou have been fiercely attacked by Communist forces for days but have not budged. Over ten thousand Communist forces north of the Bulao River are currently gathering in the Dongfushan area, showing signs of an offensive. The situation is tense in the area west of Taierzhuang. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. It is rumored that Luo Rongheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist forces' Linyi Military District, Ma Zhanrong, Commander of the Security Forces, and Zheng Tingjun, Deputy Commander, have all arrived near Chefushan to launch a large-scale offensive. The Nationalist forces in Yongcheng have repelled the attacking Communist forces. The Nationalist forces in Dangshan have not yet escaped the dangerous situation. The Communist forces in Fengxian, Shanxian, Xiayi, and Tangzhai are constantly increasing. Fierce fighting has occurred in the area west of Huangkou Station. The Communist forces' offensive this time is clearly a losing proposition. The Communist base in Huaiyin is showing signs of shaking. It is rumored that the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government has now retreated to Huaiyin, and the Zhangji Huazhong Bank has moved to Huai'an Yanzhi. Communist organs in Binying have also moved to Daguanzhuang. Therefore, the clearing out of the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Bureau, 10th] Military News: (1) Communist forces in Gaoyou have recently received 15,000 reinforcements from southern Shandong, attempting to attack the Yangtian Highway again. It is reported that fierce fighting has broken out near Lingtangqiao. (2) Nationalist forces are stepping up their efforts to encourage defections. In recent days, many Communist soldiers from various places have surrendered and reformed.</p>
<h3>Case Is Confirmed Solved; Perpetrator Has Been Interrogated Several Times</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 10th] News from Commander-in-Chief Gu's residence: Regarding the killings of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, after two days of investigation, has solved the Wen Yiduo killing case. The Garrison Headquarters has interrogated the perpetrator of the case several times, and the entire case is being submitted to Commander-in-Chief Gu for review.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador's Remarks; Sino-Soviet Friendship Continues to Grow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 10th] Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, met with the press at the guesthouse at 23 Banqiao Road on the morning of the 10th, stating: (1) The Paris Peace Conference will definitely succeed in treading the same path and repeating its success, because world peacemakers have never failed. (2) Sino-Soviet friendship continues to grow. (3) He was very pleased to have been invited to a banquet by Chairman Chiang and his wife last night. (4) The Ambassador plans to reside in Guling for a considerable period. Regarding the rumor that he will return to his country after leaving the mountain, the Ambassador has no such intention personally.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Xianghe; UNRRA Agricultural Expert Shot Again</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Bureau, 10th] It is now confirmed that Xianghe is still in the hands of the Communist forces. It is now learned that the Communist forces have amassed 50,000 troops in the area, preparing for a large-scale decisive battle. At the same time, the Communist side is propagating that the Nationalist forces are also preparing. Currently, there is fierce fighting at various strongholds on the outskirts of Xianghe. Yesterday, the Communist forces even used mustard gas shells, and a group of Nationalist soldiers were poisoned and are waiting to die.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 10th] It was learned today that UNRRA and China Relief Administration agricultural expert Di Yu and his translator Wu Yuehan were ambushed on the Pingjin Road in an UNRRA Jeep this morning. The incident occurred about 30 li from Tianjin. First, a plainclothes Chinese man fired a shot, followed by about 40 people in blue-gray Communist military uniforms who rushed out of the wheat field and stood on the side of the road, all firing. Although Di's car was hit in many places, the two were fortunately unharmed. Di and his translator had returned from the Rehe Communist area and had discussed the restoration of agriculture in Rehe with Communist leaders while in Rehe.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Bureau, 10th] The 25-member team responsible for investigating the Anping incident held and adjourned a meeting today amidst much noise and commotion. The meeting began at 9 AM in room K31 of the Xiehe Hospital. The representatives of the Marine Corps, who have been waiting in Beiping for three or four days to report to the Executive Headquarters, arrived on time and stood in the corridor outside the room. Chairman Davis repeated his old arguments, proposing to listen to the report of the Marine Corps. Communist representative Huang Yifeng also firmly opposed this proposal, as always. As the meeting progressed, Davis said sadly, "Six days have passed very easily, and we have only done a small part of the work we should have done. Now the three committee members also want to know what we have done. We should review what we have done in the last six days and give them a report. Now I have made such a report. If you agree, you can sign it as a joint report. If you don't agree, you can make a separate report." Huang Yifeng agreed with this proposal but added additional explanations. From this point on, there was a storm of debate, dragging the discussion topic to speaking procedures and speaking rights, and there was constant noise and commotion. At 10 AM, an angry Colonel Davis grabbed his briefcase and announced the adjournment. The three committee members of the Executive Headquarters held a meeting in the afternoon, which broke the deadlock and ordered the team to reconvene on the 11th. However, the team members also felt at a loss as to when the team would depart for the investigation.</p>
<h3>Lushan Summer Camp Ends on the 23rd; Chairman Visited Camp Yesterday to Watch a Play</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Bureau, 10th] Chairman Chiang personally visited the summer camp on the evening of the 10th to watch a play, which was "San Niang Teaches Her Son."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, 10th] The Lushan Summer Camp will end on August 23rd, as decided at the camp affairs meeting on the morning of the 10th. The second national congress of the Youth Corps, scheduled to be held on September 1st, will begin registration at the Chuanxi Study Hall on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops in Hubei Surrender One After Another; Local Governments Have Done Their Best to Accommodate Them</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Bureau, 10th] According to the military's announcement at 2 AM this morning, the number of Communist regular troops and local armed forces and their party and government workers who have surrendered with their weapons has been increasing daily. In total, since Li Xiannian's troops began to flee westward until the end of July, the number of officers and soldiers who have surrendered to Anlu, Yingshan, and other nine counties has averaged over 1,000 per county, with over 200 guns. All of them are being accommodated by the local governments as much as possible.</p>
<h3>CCP Continues to Propagandize Anti-Americanism; Hopes for International Interference in China; U.S. Military Aid to China Bill Is Stalled</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Bureau, 9th] After the Beiping Garrison Headquarters sent troops to guard the safety of the Pingjin Highway, the CCP greatly propagandized that the Nationalist forces were attacking the "Eastern Hebei Liberated Area," even claiming that the U.S. military was constantly reinforcing the Nationalist forces, attempting to divert attention and cover up the Anping incident. Furthermore, the Yan'an Liberation Daily's editorial on the 5th of this month stated that the U.S. military's continued presence in China was originally a pretext for assisting China in repatriating Japanese prisoners of war. This pretext no longer exists. If the U.S. military does not withdraw at this time, it will be similar to the "occupation forces" stationed in Japan under the command of General MacArthur. The CCP's propaganda clearly intends to use the words "occupation forces" to arouse the resentment of ignorant peasants and lay the groundwork for expanding the anti-American movement.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 9th] Recently, the theory of international interference has been vaguely circulating, and the source is unknown. After Wang Bingnan, the CCP spokesperson, made a statement on the evening of the 7th, the public suddenly understood. The main points of Wang's statement, in addition to exaggerating the seriousness of the current situation, stated that the CCP believes that the three major powers of Britain, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should "guarantee China's peace and democratic politics" in accordance with the Moscow Communiqué. It is morally responsible for monitoring the United States to faithfully implement the terms of the communiqué. The current state of affairs is the final test of whether the United States will conduct mediation in accordance with the principles established in Moscow and Washington. It can be seen that Wang Bingnan represents the CCP in hoping that the Soviet Union and Britain will intervene in Chinese affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, Washington, 9th] A Chinese reporter recently met with U.S. Representative Judd. It was reported that the current "civil war" in China has caused considerable "setbacks" to the bill to provide military aid to China and send a military delegation to China. He also stated that if China does have the possibility of reorganizing the government and implementing the unified compilation of the Nationalist and Communist forces, then the bill will undoubtedly be passed, but at present, the opportunity has been lost. Judd also said that the bill did not clearly stipulate whether military aid to China would be granted before or after the establishment of a reorganized government in China, and the wording was unclear, so that even members who were extremely friendly to China expressed indifference to the bill. Currently, the bill is shelved in the House Rules Committee before Congress adjourns.</p>

<h3>Landmine Explosion North of Loutai: Coal Train Derails on the Beining Railway; Guarding U.S. Troops Subsequently Attacked</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] According to an announcement by the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters here: At 11:30 PM on the 9th, a coal train on the Beining Line, heading from Guye to Tanggu, was traveling three kilometers north of Loutai when it was struck by three landmines. Eight of the train's twenty-five cars derailed, four of which were destroyed. Loutai is located sixty miles northwest of Tianjin. Following the explosion, approximately fifty Chinese armed personnel immediately opened fire on the train. The four U.S. Marine guards returned fire. It is reported that two Chinese individuals may have been injured, while the U.S. Marines were unharmed. The Marine unit proceeded to Loutai and joined a patrol of eighty men, returning to Tanggu on the morning of the 10th.

<h3>French Troops in Vietnam Commit Repeated Atrocities; We Lodge a Serious Protest; Emergency Measures Taken Regarding the Case of a Taiwanese Compatriot Shot by Japanese Police</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] When this reporter inquired with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson about the truth of the French army's massacre of our compatriots in Vietnam, he stated that according to a report from the Consulate General in Saigon: In Tan Huong City, Ben Tre Province, Cochinchina, Vietnam, on July 21st, sixty to seventy French soldiers shelled the city and then entered, searching house by house. Twenty-one compatriots were beaten, three were injured, and five went missing. The city was burned in various places, and the property losses of the compatriots are inestimable. Our Consulate General in Saigon has lodged a serious protest with the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, demanding punishment for the perpetrators and compensation for the losses. They also demanded a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Furthermore, on the evening of the 10th of last month, at 9:00 PM, more than one hundred French soldiers surrounded shops in Quan Tho Village, six kilometers from Saigon, drove out residents, and set fire to their homes. Thirteen businesses, including Chinese leather factories, were burned, and forty-three Chinese were detained and released the next day. One Chinese woman was severely injured. On the morning of the 13th, at 9:45 AM, French troops again went to the village and opened fire indiscriminately, killing three passersby, two of whom were Chinese. The Chinese government is extremely shocked by the French army's atrocities and has lodged a serious protest with the French Embassy, requesting that the French Ambassador immediately cable the French authorities in Vietnam to stop such behavior, investigate responsibility, and severely punish the perpetrators. Our government also reserves the right to claim compensation for loss of life and property.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] He Fengshan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, held a press conference at noon today to explain the truth about the case of a Taiwanese compatriot shot by Japanese police in Tokyo. Mr. He first reported on the Qiantani incident (details omitted), and then stated: After receiving the report, this Ministry immediately instructed the delegation in Japan to take the following emergency measures: (1) The delegation should conduct a joint investigation with the Allied Headquarters to clarify the truth of the situation; (2) Once the incident is investigated and reported, our demands will be made; (3) Take appropriate measures to prevent the situation from spreading and escalating, and to protect the safety of compatriots; (4) Please instruct the Allied Headquarters that the Japanese government and public opinion should not deliberately exaggerate or make inflammatory propaganda. This case is still under active negotiation by our side. As for the previous report that the Taiwanese compatriot had admitted to firing at the Japanese police, it was due to an error in the secondary translation by the U.S. Military Police Headquarters in Japan, which has been corrected by the U.S. side.</p>

<h3>Increasing Number of Refugees in Jinan Eagerly Await Relief</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, September 9th] The number of refugees in Jinan remains high, most relying on relatives and friends, causing their relatives and friends to also become refugees. There are many unemployed veterans who cannot be resettled. The refugees are eagerly awaiting Mr. Gu Zhengcheng's visit to Jinan to petition him for temporary and permanent relief. The collection of grain taxes in kind is an unbearable burden for the people of Shandong Province and is extremely difficult to implement. It is unlikely to be effective. The people hope for a delay in the collection to alleviate their suffering. Due to the inability to transport relief materials, the work of the Post-War Relief Administration is difficult to carry out, and it has ordered a reduction of one-fifth of its Jinan staff.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Industrial and Commercial Sectors Cry for Help!</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Industries, due to the severe crisis currently facing industry and commerce, have drafted a rescue plan and sent representatives to Beijing on the evening of the 8th to petition. Those industries suffering the most have also dispatched additional representatives to accompany them. It is reported that chambers of commerce in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places, feeling the same plight, are responding in kind. This action clearly demonstrates that the industrial and commercial sectors are crying for help, which carries a very profound significance. Although the results of their petition in the capital these past two days are not yet known, we believe that this petition must succeed and not fail; furthermore, Premier Song met with leaders of the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors in Shanghai the day before yesterday to listen to their concerns, and we can trust that the government will not allow this petition by the industrial and commercial sectors to fail.</p>
<p>Now, we wish to speak a few words to the government and the industrial and commercial sectors from the position of journalists. First and foremost, it must be pointed out that the crisis in industry and commerce is already here, not a prediction. Just look at the sluggish sales in all industries and the endless closures of factories and shops, and it is an ironclad fact. Moreover, this situation is not limited to Shanghai alone. There are naturally many reasons for this, and there is no need to elaborate here. However, the failure of government-run financial institutions to coordinate with productive enterprises, and the comprador-minded foreign exchange and trade policies failing to stabilize the national economy, are the two most important primary causes.</p>
<p>We know that the Four Banks Joint Treasury, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, etc., have all achieved considerable results. However, their achievements are merely their own achievements, merely the achievements of their own operating surpluses, not the achievements of industry and commerce in general, let alone the achievements of national economic development. Regarding the so-called support for industry and commerce, and the development of production, etc., whether they can truly fulfill their mission remains doubtful to the outside world. For example, loan policies have recently become tightened, and business procedures have become exceptionally complicated. In considering the safeguarding of their own stability, there is naturally nothing to criticize. However, when it comes to the tasks of regulating finance and supporting production, whether they have been fully utilized to a satisfactory degree seems to be another question.</p>
<p>Taking industrial loans as an example, it seems that quite a few loans have indeed been issued after various urging. However, the total amount, it is said, is still less than two percent of the total annual expenditure. Taking private banks as an example, we only hear of "increasing reserve requirements" and "restricting loans," etc. As for promoting the flexibility of the financial market, are there any active measures? The facts are evident, and it seems unnecessary for us to dwell on them further.</p>
<p>The exchange rate against the US dollar has long been fixed, approximately six to seven hundred times higher than before the war. However, the domestic price index has risen to four to five thousand times. Even if the US price level is calculated according to the black market, it has only increased three to four times. Is this approach hindering exports and encouraging imports? Major export goods such as silk, tea, and tung oil still cannot recover. On the import side, luxury goods and essential goods are treated equally in terms of foreign exchange settlement. Among essential goods, such as machinery, even three-month drafts are insufficient to cope with the situation, and they are instead hit hard and unable to place orders. As a result, a large amount of foreign exchange funds flow to luxury goods and foreign surplus goods as collateral.</p>
<p>We also know that certain types of imported goods were originally subject to an additional 50% luxury tax, and that certain types were prohibited from import. However, the additional 50% surcharge, in reality, does not affect the profits of foreign exporters, and the so-called prohibited imports are only a meager twenty-odd items. Apart from these twenty-odd items, it seems that there are still many, many things that China does not need at present, especially in post-war China. If international trade is still regarded as the last barrier to international lending, and if it is believed that the domestic economy is too weak to serve as a drain for foreign goods, then it seems that the rationality of this approach is still open for discussion.</p>
<p>The above two policies (financial policy and foreign exchange and trade policy) clearly still have errors. It must be understood that focusing only on banknotes and neglecting the overall economy, thus tightening loans to productive enterprises, is truly a one-sided view. As for foreign exchange and international trade, the practice of extending foreign exchange payments for fear of increased banknote payouts, and considering the cheap import of foreign goods as a way to promote the withdrawal of legal tender by selling them at higher prices, we also believe that the soundness of this shopkeeper-like argument needs to be re-examined. Because the tighter the finances, the weaker production will be; the more foreign goods, the more difficult the economy will be. Is there a country in the world that can afford to not engage in production themselves and rely solely on foreign goods for their entire lives?</p>
<p>Secondly, we must also hope that the industrial and commercial sectors will rise up and save themselves. There are too many crises currently facing industry and commerce, apart from the few mentioned above. The problems of local order, transportation, and power, etc., are all things that cannot be solved by self-reliance alone. As for how to adjust production equipment, how to reduce labor-management disputes, and even improve management and expand sales, people in the industry cannot shirk their responsibility and should at least bear the majority of the responsibility. Therefore, in our opinion, those with outdated machinery, poor quality products, and product costs higher than the general level, may as well be strictly eliminated, and should no longer be allowed to waste financial resources and resources. As for those with more favorable production conditions and capable of sustaining themselves, they should seek practical connections with financial institutions and engage in production actively with a spirit of hard work and perseverance. For workers with poor skills, efforts should be made to improve them; the relief of unemployed workers should be the responsibility of the state, and the productive enterprise of the factory should not be regarded as a charitable relief undertaking. Only then can people in the industry concentrate their labor compensation on diligent workers. If handled in this way, the industrial sector may still have a glimmer of hope. As for the commercial sector, in recent years, its abnormal development has failed to coordinate with industrial products and consumer purchasing power. In addition to adjusting finances to avoid being hit by a complete collapse, it seems that they should also have a thorough awakening and consider merging with each other to save labor costs.</p>
<p>Finally, we must not forget the farmers who account for more than 80% of the national population. They are the suppliers of raw materials and also the consumers of products. Therefore, revitalizing the countryside and increasing their economic capacity is the most fundamental and important plan. Although the Farmers Bank of China is working very hard at present, in the eyes of ordinary farmers, it still feels like a drop in the bucket. Coupled with the too-short loan terms, the too-great attraction of foreign goods, the large-scale import of American cotton, and the large-scale dumping of foreign wheat, farmers' confidence in planting cotton and wheat has been further cooled. The root cause of the problem is still due to the authorities' too-shortsighted vision, too-small calculations, and the improper handling of financial policy and foreign exchange and trade policy.</p>
<p>The situation is truly urgent! The national economic crisis is becoming more and more apparent day by day! The industrial and commercial sectors have reached the point where "when people are poor, they call on heaven," and everyone is forced to cry out to the government for help! If we only know how to follow the old path of "comprador policy" and plan to recover banknotes by dumping foreign goods, I am afraid that one day we will reach "national poverty and exhausted wealth," and how can the government be stable? If we do not quickly "mend the fold after the sheep is lost" now, we will inevitably "gnaw at our navels too late" in the future!</p>

<p>Confiscation of Traitorous Property Already Decided</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Command executed twenty-six traitors from the Anti-Japanese War period at the Song Park Road execution ground. Among them were three people from Wuxi: Dong Huimin, Guo Bingyan, and Ren Zhenglei. It is learned that after hearing the news, the families of Dong and the others rushed to Shanghai to re-coffin and enshroud the bodies. Ren's wife, Lin Lanzhen, a young woman from the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant, returned to Wuxi yesterday with disheveled hair and a dirty face, wearing a short black Xiangyunsha cheongsam, tied with a white waistband, a face full of tears, carrying two young children, and mentally disturbed, wandering by the park pond, intending to jump into the pond to commit suicide. Ren's shares in the Taihe Tobacco Company have been seized by the enemy property disposal bureau. In addition, the Dalai Department Store on Tongyun Road, which was opened by Guo Bingyan, was also sealed up on the 8th. However, Guo's younger brother, Guo Bingquan, came forward to defend himself and provide evidence, requesting exemption from the seal.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Rushing to Repair the Entire Wujin Highway</p>
<p>The Wujin County Government previously received an order from the First Pacification Zone Headquarters to repair the highway between Ximen Huaide Bridge and the airfield. It has dispatched personnel to conduct on-site inspections of the original road and ordered the Nan'yunzhen in the First District and the Haitang and Chendu townships in the Second District to repair sections, carrying crushed bricks and tiles to fill and flatten the uneven areas of the original road surface. They have been rushing to build it in recent days. Due to the scorching weather and the lack of materials, several small sections have not yet been completed. County Magistrate Sun personally inspected the route on the 8th, strictly ordering the responsible townships to complete it within a deadline. However, according to the plan of the engineers, the emergency repair is only temporary and difficult to last for a long time. The fundamental solution is to overturn the entire old roadbed, pave it with marble, pour slurry, press it flat, and then cover it with coal slag and yellow sand, otherwise it will be useless. However, the county government cannot afford this project, so it has telegraphed the Provincial Highway Administration, requesting that a road maintenance office be established in Changzhou as soon as possible to be responsible for the cultivation and repair. The provincial government believes that the establishment of the Changzhou Road Maintenance Office cannot be delayed due to the tense military situation in northern Jiangsu. It has instructed the county government to approve it immediately. The Road Maintenance Office will purchase and allocate materials, and the county will requisition civilian laborers to rush to repair the entire Wu (jin) Jin (tan) highway, with a deadline for completion. After the Road Maintenance Office is established in the coming days, it is expected that the materials will be allocated successively and can be implemented. The county government has recently reported the above situation to Commander Li Moan of the Pacification Department for verification.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Relief for Refugees, Rice Collection Campaign</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in northern Jiangsu, refugees have been crossing the river south in an endless stream. Apart from a small number who have sought refuge with relatives and friends and found other ways to live, those who cannot make a living have reached four to five hundred people. Recently, as they are running out of food and becoming starving, the city district director, Han Guozhang, initiated a campaign to have residents of each town in the city district donate one liter of rice per household. The Jia head is responsible for collecting the rice. Those who cannot afford it are exempt, and those who are happy to donate more are welcome. The towns will be responsible for preserving the collected rice and reporting it to the county government, notifying the person in charge of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association to prepare documents and receive it.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Construction Office Dispatches Personnel to Supervise Highway Repair</p>
<p>The Provincial Construction Office dispatched inspectors Wu Shuyuan and Shen Anzuo to the county to supervise the repair of the Tongru Highway. On the 6th, they accompanied Section Chief Wei of the county government to inspect the highways in the second and third districts of Tangzha, Pingchao, and Baipu. They departed at 10:00 AM and convened a meeting of township heads at the Second District Office to discuss the repair of the Zha Port, Cheng Port, and Tianyun Highway sections of the Tongru Road, as well as the emergency repair of the Pingchao, Xinba, and Jiuhuashan highways. At 3:00 PM, they went to Baipu to attend a meeting of township heads at the Third District Office. There was a detailed discussion on the emergency repair of bridges. Inspector Wu told reporters yesterday that the Tongru Highway will be fully started in the shortest possible time. The road surface will be paved with coal slag, and the width will also be increased. In the future, the Tongru Highway will be as flat as before, and traffic will be smooth and convenient, he said.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Replenishing Police Force, Receiving Guns and Ammunition</p>
<p>In order to replenish the police force and consolidate the security of various places, the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has specially received 3,000 rifles and 330,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as 30 Czech-style light machine guns, from the Ministry of Military Affairs. The above weapons have been transported to Hangzhou, and the department is currently planning to distribute them to the police bureaus of various counties according to their needs, in order to increase their strength.</p>

<h3>The Treaty with Italy is Excessively Harsh. The Italian Prime Minister Expresses Dissatisfaction. The Representatives of the Enemy Countries Speak for the First Time at the Peace Conference. They Hope that the Sacrifices Made Can Receive Some Compensation.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 10th Instant, Emergency Broadcast: When the European Peace Conference convened at 3:10 PM this afternoon (midnight Shanghai time), Italian Prime Minister Gasperi delivered a speech, saying that Italy was attending the Peace Conference as a defeated country, and said that he felt that the Italian Peace Treaty was very harsh. If this conference is truly a tool for revitalization and international cooperation, then the sacrifices made by the Italians can at least receive some compensation here. According to Article 2 of the United Nations Charter of San Francisco, in international relations, all parties agree to reject the use of force, and at the same time, in order to conform to the principle of sovereign equality, all countries should mutually guarantee "territorial integrity and political independence." Italy has already been punished for its fascist past, and it seems that all nations should restore the new spirit of international cooperation in the future, but the harsh provisions in the treaty force me to make some appeals. If we consider our defense capabilities, then our independence will even be in imminent danger. In the modern history of our country, the doors have never been opened so wide as this time, and our defense capabilities have never been subject to such harsh restrictions. Gasperi concluded by saying: Please do not forget the Potsdam Agreement of August 2, 1945. Italy was the first Axis country to break off relations with Germany and made a concrete contribution to the collapse of the Nazis on the Allied side. We were the first to join the Allies and declare war on Japan. We automatically liberated ourselves from the fascist regime and embarked on the path of progress towards a democratic political system. All of this was recognized by the Potsdam Conference. But what about this draft Italian Peace Treaty? It seems that the Italian nation has disappeared from the stage of history, and so on.</p>

The United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada have decided to jointly end European relief work at the end of this year, and Eastern relief work will end at the end of March next year. UNRRA's expenditure is nearly 400 million US dollars, of which three-quarters is donated by the United States, and 80% of the remainder is donated by the United Kingdom and Canada.</p>
<h3>Talking About Peace and Not Forgetting Women: The Peace Conference Delegation is Busy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th Instant, Dispatch] The solemn Peace Conference representatives, in addition to creating world peace, have various entertainments of their own, and the beautiful women of the "Shepherdess Song" are the most sought after by them. These dancers are naked, with only small pieces of gold and silver cloth covering their vital parts. Their dancing skills are superb and extremely sensual. This secret pastime of the Peace Conference representatives will be announced by five young female receptionists, who are responsible for taking care of all the needs of the Peace Conference representatives outside of work, but strictly in an advisory capacity. In the ornately decorated offices on the second floor of the Peace Conference venue, the Château Palace, the receptionists distribute cigarettes to the representatives and special correspondents every day. They also issue purchase certificates for cloth, shoes, and food (because Paris is still implementing a rationing system). Fifty movie theaters in Paris have set up free seats for the Peace Conference representatives, and twenty-five restaurants also provide meals, exempting the luxury tax. Some representatives who can take a few days off during the meeting have various arrangements to travel to the Côte d'Azur, Érez Duville, and other scenic spots in Greece for short trips. Public buses go directly to Reims and its famous champagne cellars, the Normandy coast, and the quaint villages of Brittany, allowing guests to enjoy famous attractions.</p>

<h3>From Underground Work to President: The Continued Success of René Coty</h3>
<p>René Coty, the President and Foreign Minister of the French Provisional Government, has always been a skillful mediator. In a country full of elderly politicians, the 46-year-old Coty was able to rise to become the nation's leader because of his ability to reconcile various parties. During the occupation period, he coordinated the various anti-enemy underground forces, enabling them to come together. After the victory, this responsibility became even greater, because on the international front, Coty believed that France must act as a mediator between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Canada, so that they can live in harmony; otherwise, France will be sacrificed in the conflict between these two sides. Domestically, his policy is to make the many different parties and elements in the cabinet focus on the urgent needs of the country. Usually, his approach is to make them see how domestic conflicts will affect France's international position. His cabinet was born in a complex and eventful period internationally, and is also charged with the mission of formulating the future French constitution, so Coty's responsibilities can be said to be greater than those of any Prime Minister in French history.</p>
<p>Coty is short in stature, with a calm appearance but a highly impulsive inner self, but he has extremely strong physical strength and courage, which is one of his greatest characteristics. Because of this, he sometimes acts recklessly, even acting rashly without any consideration. But at other times, he is extremely flexible, able to circumvent obstacles that are difficult to overcome, and take another path. This is what we often saw him do when he was Foreign Minister in de Gaulle's government.</p>
<p>In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, Coty was drafted into the army. After the war ended, Coty decided to enter the field of education, teaching at the Lycée de Versailles. At that time, he also became interested in social movements and served as the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. This newspaper was originally unknown and attracted little attention, but because of the strong and powerful editorials he wrote, sales immediately increased significantly. In 1936, he wrote in support of Léon Blum's Popular Front government; on the Spanish question, he sympathized with the left wing; and his most important pre-war editorial was a critique of the Munich Agreement.</p>
<p>In 1939, when the Second World War broke out, Coty immediately joined the army. In May 1940, the division to which he belonged was surrounded by German troops, and he himself was captured and imprisoned in a concentration camp. He was finally released a year later. After his release, he immediately sought contact with French underground workers. He wanted to rescue his comrades who were still in concentration camps, and he wanted to liberate France from the chains of iron fetters. Unlike other patriots, he did not go abroad, but remained in France, organizing various underground anti-enemy forces to fight the Germans. During the day, he taught at the university, and at night, he discussed strategies and planned arrangements with his comrades. His personality and reputation were his best guarantee; he never disguised or hid, but simply came and went in peace. No one suspected that this calm young man was a figure bearing such a heavy mission.</p>
<p>After the victory of the war, General de Gaulle returned to Paris. Coty, because he was on good terms with all parties - left, right, middle class, workers - he could get along with them and coordinate them, so as a result, Coty served as Foreign Minister in de Gaulle's cabinet. Later, de Gaulle resigned, and his successor, President Gouin, disagreed with him politically. Coty, with the joint support of the left and right wings, jumped to become the youngest president in French history.</p>
<p>Coty only married last year. The new First Lady, who has long served in diplomatic circles, was a loyal comrade in Coty's underground work days and made a great contribution to the liberation of France. Currently, she is Coty's most powerful advisor and assistant.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Invites the Press to Report on Municipal Facilities and Discuss Various Issues: Economic Difficulties are Paramount; Nearly 200,000 Children Out of School; Revenue Does Not Meet Expenditures, Open Up New Revenue Sources and Reduce Expenditures; Solve the Housing Shortage by Encouraging House Construction</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At 3:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Wu hosted the heads of various newspapers in the city at the Municipal Government Conference Room for the third symposium. Those in attendance included Feng Youzhen, Cheng Cangbo, Wang Yunsheng, Chen Xunian, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhan Wenhuan, Gu Zhizhong, Zhao Minheng, Yuan Rongyu, and more than 30 others. Mayor Wu first reported on the Municipal Government's organization, handling of public property, revenue and expenditure situation, and current status of projects, and then invited discussion on issues such as sanitation, education, housing shortage, and transportation. The meeting proceeded in a harmonious and enthusiastic atmosphere and adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu first presented a report on the organization of the Municipal Government, stating that it was indeed large. It was determined that three principles should be implemented: (1) The number of Municipal Government employees should not exceed the total number of employees of the previous Municipal Government, the Public Concession Board, and the French Concession Municipal Council. Some believe that with the unification of the Municipal Government, the number of employees should be further reduced than before. However, in the past, the total number of citizens in these three districts was about 3.4 million, but now the number of citizens who have applied for ID cards from the Municipal Government has reached 3.67 million. If we add the number of people who have not yet obtained certificates, the total number of citizens in Shanghai is about 4.5 million. As the number of people has increased, the workload has also increased, so the number of Municipal Government employees cannot be reduced any further. (2) It is proposed to increase the number of senior Municipal Government officials. Shanghai is different from inland cities. In inland city governments, it is enough for one or two people to understand foreign languages, but in the Shanghai Municipal Government, officials with considerable positions must be proficient in at least two languages. Among the junior officials, there are too few talented people. Shanghai's cultural level is very high, and it is not easy to handle affairs. The level of foreign political positions depends on the nature of the service. It is not easy to do if the Shanghai Municipal Government wants to adopt the organization of city governments such as Hankou and Chongqing, so the number of senior officials must be increased. (3) Regarding the institutions attached to the Municipal Government, 80-90% of them were originally owned by the former British and French Concession era. Other organizations, such as the Committee for Relief of Unemployed Workers, have no precedents, but are also necessary to be established in fact. Other institutions are currently being strictly examined, and if there is no need for their existence, they will be abolished. The Mayor then talked about the current situation of downsizing the Municipal Government, saying that the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus have cut more than 370 people, including more than 100 people from the Municipal Government headquarters.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Property Will Never Be Sold; Revenue Does Not Meet Expenditures, Open Up New Revenue Sources and Reduce Expenditures</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of public property of the Municipal Government, some newspapers have criticized the Municipal Government for not cleaning up and planning to sell it. The Mayor said: "I will never sell the public property in my hands." However, this matter cannot be handled by the Municipal Government Public Property Clearing Committee, but must be based on the Land Law, approved by the Executive Yuan, and agreed by the public opinion organ (such as the Municipal Council). At present, each bureau should first hand over the inventory of the received public property to the Land Administration Bureau for clearing, and then allow citizens to review it and publicly solicit reports of any concealment. It is rumored that when the French Concession transferred public property to the puppet organization, there were concealment situations. The Municipal Government has submitted inquiries to the French consulate.</p>
<p>The fact that the Municipal Government's revenue does not meet its expenditures is indeed true. The solution is nothing more than opening up new revenue sources and reducing expenditures. The Municipal Government cannot talk about the way to open up new revenue sources. If you have any good ideas that can increase revenue without disturbing the people, I would appreciate your guidance.</p>
<p>Two Major Projects</p>
<p>Regarding the projects undertaken by the Municipal Government, the two largest expenditures are flood control projects. The Municipal Government has already paid 80 million yuan in this area, and the Bureau of Public Works requires at least 100 million yuan. The second is the seawall project, and the Municipal Government has also spent 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Mayor also mentioned cracking down on theft at the docks, and the Municipal Government has paid attention to it. Based on secret reports, 19 people from 36 gangs of dock bandits were arrested, and several of them were famous criminals. The Mayor then invited those present to express their opinions on four issues: sanitation, out-of-school school-age children, housing shortage, and traffic congestion.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The Mayor said that fundamentally there are not enough schools, and if you want to add them, the Municipal Government's finances are very difficult, and the problem is difficult to solve. Gu Zhizhong suggested that it is better to open primary and secondary schools at night, and that students still have formal qualifications. Wang Yunsheng said that his six sons and daughters are currently busy with transfer exams, running around under the scorching sun, which is very pitiful. His youngest son wants to enter kindergarten, and he also has to be busy with exams in the morning and afternoon. He advocated that students from the rear who have formal proof documents should be allowed to enroll without exams. In addition, he also advocated that the method of giving public financial subsidies to students from the rear should be continued. Mayor Wu said that the current municipal elementary schools enroll a total of 66,000 students, and private elementary schools enroll about 201,000 students, for a total of 207,000 students. However, according to Shanghai's population, there should be about 450,000 school-age children. If the two-shift system is changed, 480 classes can be added, and 24,000 children can be enrolled, but 700 teachers must be added, and the Municipal Government's burden will increase by 140 million yuan. If students pay a certain amount of teacher's fees, such as 2,000 yuan per month, parents should be able to afford it, and expansion can be achieved. Poor students can be exempted from meals. Feng Youzhen advocated a half-day class system, so that one school can be used as two schools. He believes that the tuition fees of municipal elementary schools may be appropriately increased, but there is no need to establish separate items such as entertainment fees. Zuo Shunsheng said that the Municipal Government should also pay attention to social education, and Shanghai should not have a public library that can accommodate 10,000 people. Zhao Minheng and Zhan Wenhuan also expressed their opinions. At this point, Mayor Wu said again.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Housing Shortage</p>
<p>Is indeed a fact, and a solution has been drafted: (1) Instruct owners in areas with convenient transportation to build houses as soon as possible, and the Central Bank can provide subsidies. If the owners delay building, their land will be used as shares and the Real Estate Association will be asked to build on their behalf. If they still refuse to agree, the Municipal Government will levy a considerable fee. (2) Build 150 affordable housing villages, but there are too many registered people. If the rent is low, the competition will be uneven. If the rent is high, there will be suspicion of profiteering. Therefore, it is planned to sell them and use the proceeds to build new houses.</p>
<p>Sanitation Problems</p>
<p>Currently, garbage is piled up, and the Municipal Government sends trucks to clear it, which is not economical. In the future, it is planned to entrust it to the Baojia system. Each household must have a container for garbage, which will be concentrated in one place at a fixed time, and then cleared. The Health Bureau is drafting a solution.</p>
<p>Transportation Problems</p>
<p>Several solutions have been drafted: (1) Designate parking areas, (2) Increase one-way routes, (3) In the future, air force vehicles must be parked in designated locations and are not allowed to travel on the road. The details of this matter will be decided at the meeting on August 15.</p>

<h3>A Witness Who Exposed Yang Wendao's Case Years Ago Caught "Cao Cao" on a Narrow Road on the Yuezhou Ship; Attempt to Change Name and Disguise Thwarted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 9:30 yesterday morning, the Yuezhou ship, berthed at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund of Jinling Road, honked its whistle frequently, about to sail to Hong Kong. Suddenly, a black-牌汽 (no direct translation of this phrase) military vehicle sped over, and a young man led a forensic doctor directly to the third-class cabin on the ship. At that time, a thin Cantonese man in his fifties, his leg bandaged in gauze, was sitting on a canvas. Seeing them walk in, he immediately lay face down on the bed, wearing black glasses, as if to avoid their attention. This young man was none other than Yang Hanzhi, the son of Yang Wendao. And this man in his fifties was none other than Zeng Yuanjin (i.e., Zeng Yuan), an important witness in the Yang case who exposed Yang Wendao as the murderer of Nakayama Hideo. When the bailiff asked Zeng Yuan's name, Zeng Yuan replied: "My surname is Cao, my name is Cao." Yang Hanzhi directly rebuked him for his lies, pointed out that he was indeed Zeng Yuan himself, and said that there were photos in his pocket that could prove it. The bailiff also showed a subpoena, and when Zeng Yuan saw the words "Resisting the subpoena will result in arrest" and "Handed over to the bailiff to be taken back" on the subpoena, he could not help but turn pale, bowed his head and said nothing. He handed over the banknotes in his bag and the hand-carved items to his friend, and together they followed Yang and others ashore, entered a car, and went to the Zhejiang Road High Court. Yang Hanzhi had been waiting on the ship since 8 o'clock the night before, and had been waiting for fourteen hours, so that Zeng Yuan, who was trying to escape, could not escape the net.</p>
<p>The court opened a temporary investigation hearing at 12:30 to question him. First, Yang Wendao was brought up and asked about his age and birthplace. Then Zeng Yuan was brought up. Zeng Yuan no longer called himself Cao Cao in this solemn court. The judge asked him if he knew Yang Wendao, and he replied that he did. He also said that he met Zheng Weimin when they were getting morphine injections, and that another witness, Zhang Chen, was his childhood classmate. The judge then flipped through the files and sternly asked why he had conspired to frame him at the time. Zeng Yuan replied that there was no such thing. The judge was extremely angry and ordered him to be sent to the prosecutor's office for investigation. Thus, on the afternoon of the anniversary of Japan's surrender, Zeng Yuan was sent to the detention center of the District Prosecutor's Office, where Yang Wendao had been detained ten years ago.</p>

<h3>The Gold Brick Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment: Yang Dewei and Others Provide Detailed Information on the Process of Pawning and Selling the Gold Brick; Chen Yuansheng Still Claims He Was Confused for a Moment</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Bank's stolen gold brick case was retried by the judge in the Criminal Court No. 2 of the District Court at 2:30 yesterday afternoon. Pan Jia_, former assistant manager and director of the business department of the former city bank, and Yang Dewei, the deputy director, were summoned to the court. The main suspect Chen Yuansheng and other defendants Wu Mingguang, Wang Shumei, Chen Youqing, and Shi Xianglong all appeared in court. The interrogation lasted for three hours and ended at 5:30. The case has been concluded and is scheduled to be sentenced at 12:00 noon on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>According to Yang Dewei, at 2:00 p.m. on April 24th, Pan _ ordered me to accompany Wang Shumei (manager of Xinda Stock Company, representing the person who came forward to make the mortgage) to mortgage the gold brick to Wu Mingguang (assistant manager of Chongqing Bank, who accepted the mortgage), because Wang and Wu did not know each other, so I was ordered to introduce them. At that time, Pan only said that the gold brick was for a friend to make a mortgage. After handing it over to Wu, I did not look at it due to the urgency of time and the relationship of trust. After more than ten minutes, I brought back the mortgage application. At 11:30 a.m. on May 4th, Chen Yuansheng wanted to _ go, so he asked me to call and buy it from San Tai Bank. The old bookkeeper of Chongqing Bank carried the gold brick away. I do not know English (there is English on the gold brick), and I do not know that the gold brick was _obtained. When asked, Pan Jia_ falsely claimed: In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), he and Chen Yuansheng were trainees together, so they had known each other for a long time. When Chen brought the gold brick on April 24th, he said that the goods were mortgaged on behalf of a friend, and the gold brick was wrapped in paper. Because Chongqing Bank does not lend to private individuals, and Wang Shumei is the manager of Xinda, he asked Wang Shumei to represent and make the mortgage. I got a profit of 1.35 cents in interest. When it was due, I did not sell it for him. As a result, Yang Dewei sold it to Chen Youqing of San Tai Bank for the original owner for 1.615 million at the market price. I did not know that gold could not be mortgaged, because the Bankers Association issued a notice on March 20 saying that it could be mortgaged.</p>
<p>The main suspect, Chen Yuansheng, had a buzz cut and wore a plaid cotton short shirt and pants. He still claimed: He was confused for a moment and had no choice but to take this step. The other defendants' confessions were similar to the previous ones. At this point, the defense lawyers stood up one after another to defend their clients, and it ended at 5:30. The court debate ended and the sentence was set for the 15th. Chen Yuansheng was returned to custody, and the other defendants were still released on their original bail.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>With utmost respect, concerning the letter from Li Ming'en, the captain of the First Brigade of the Independent Police of the Northeast Railway Police Bureau, published in your newspaper on the 10th, his letter contains statements that confuse and mislead. The fact is that the patrol gendarmerie squad leader had already sent three conscripted soldiers back to the gendarmerie to impersonate three suspects (not traffic police) before the incident occurred. Therefore, only the squad leader and one soldier, Chen Feng, remained at the police station. At the time, there were approximately thirty traffic police officers present. How could they dare to assault their superiors? Moreover, at that time, the squad leader alone went forward to question them, and one of the traffic police officers struck the squad leader on the right neck with a flashlight, followed by a group assault. Another soldier stepped forward to stop them and was also assaulted, and his handgun was snatched away. The police station knew the situation very well at the time. This is the first point. Furthermore, when our team's platoon leader, Wu, entered their brigade headquarters to negotiate amicably with Captain Li, why did violence break out outside? The reason is that one of the traffic police officers from the brigade snuck out from the back door and walked toward the gendarmerie squad. The gendarmerie questioned him, and the officer shouted towards his barracks, "The gendarmerie is arresting me! Comrades, help me!" As a result, the traffic police officers became agitated. Initially, a shot was fired from the barracks wall at the gendarmerie (said to be the sound of a handgun). Subsequently, dozens of police officers rushed out of the barracks on both sides of the road, shouting "Charge! Kill!" They charged at the gendarmerie with Tommy guns, carbines, rifles, handguns, etc. As a result, the outnumbered gendarmerie members fled. This is the second point. Also, when they rushed out of the barracks, they fired wildly. It is not without mistakes. Because at that time, the gendarmerie was outnumbered and fled towards Yuyao Road to the right of their barracks. And the wounded were on Changde Road in front of their barracks, and those injured on the right side of the road (on the right sidewalk of Changde Road towards Yuyao Road) had bullet wounds in their left arms, which then penetrated the left armpit and exited from the front right waist. The person on the left was shot in the buttocks and the bullet exited from the front abdomen. And both of their heads were facing the Yuyao Road direction of the gendarmerie, clearly showing they were injured by gunfire from behind. Because if they were injured by the gendarmerie's gunfire, the bullet would have entered from the front of the injured and they would have fallen backwards. This is the third point. These facts cannot be erased. I hope that authoritative members of the press will conduct on-site investigations and conduct multiple interviews to rectify this matter in the name of justice. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sun Jidi, Captain of the Shanghai West Gendarmerie Team.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Hosts Journalists to Visit the Gaoqiao Seawall Project - Workers Chant "Hang Yu" Under the Scorching Sun</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, as the Customs House clock struck eight, the Water Hotel on the Bund was unusually lively. Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, Structural Department Director and Seawall Engineering Team Leader Zhu Guozhi, Secretary Qian Weifan, Ms. Smith, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Sino-American Industrial Association, and reporters from various newspapers occupied a large portion of the Water Hotel. Director Zhao stood up and said, "Today, the Bureau is hosting you reporters to visit the Gaoqiao Seawall project. This project started last month, and we hosted reporters twice at that time. Now, the seawall project will be completed by the middle of next month, so we are specially hosting you again for a visit..."</p>
<p>At 8:30, the sound of the ferryboats at the wharf urged us to board the boat. Director Zhao hurriedly concluded his speech, and everyone rushed onto the boat.</p>
<p>The boat slowly moved. After enjoying the scenery for a full hour and a half, the ferry took us to Gaoqiao. Upon landing, the Public Works Bureau's special cars were waiting for us at the pier. It was three kilometers from Gaoqiao Town to the seawall. The feeling of sitting in the large cars was unique. The car drove on a narrow and rugged dirt road, bouncing violently. The trees along the road occasionally reached into the car windows and hit the heads and faces of the passengers.</p>
<p>At the seawall, piles of dike-building materials, large stones, gravel, wood, foreign coal, fine sand, etc., were piled high. Workers were driving wooden piles along the coast, their bodies tanned black by the scorching sun. Their work is arduous, but it is great! The seawall is the barrier of this city, but because it has been in disrepair for many years, the body of the seawall has largely collapsed. In order to prevent flooding, the municipal government decided to rush to repair this emergency project.</p>
<p>The repair project is divided into four steps: (1) laying the foundation, (2) driving piles, (3) pouring cement, and (4) laying large stones. According to Director Zhu, after this repair project, at least thirty years of peace can be guaranteed, but if it is not repaired again, the mud dike will be subjected to the fierce attack of seawater day and night, and after four or fifty years, Gaoqiao will be unimaginable!</p>
<p>After we held an "indoor picnic," we walked along the seawall and visited two other breaches. Then, along the original road, the cars carried us back to Gaoqiao Pier. As we boarded the ferry, the workers' shouts of "Hang Yu" echoed in our ears.</p>
<p>In a daze, the ferry returned to Shanghai. Stepping onto the Bund, the Customs House clock was striking three-thirty. (Si Zai)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Secretary Yang to Shanghai to Distribute Subsidies to University Faculty and Staff - Totaling 140 Million for Beijing and Shanghai - Funds Provided by the U.S. Aid to China Commission - Distribution in Nanjing Scheduled for the 15th</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office] Since the victory, prices have soared, and the cost of living has risen, especially in Beijing and Shanghai. Professors at various universities in Beijing and Shanghai have repeatedly appealed to the Ministry of Education during June and July due to severe pressure from the cost of living. Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education has been concerned about this matter and has gone to Shanghai to have sincere talks with professors from various universities and held meetings with professors in Beijing to exchange ideas. From the professors' point of view, the actual situation requires relief, but for all public employees, the authority belongs to the Executive Yuan, and comprehensive planning is necessary, making it difficult to find a perfect solution.

<h3>The Number of Applicants for Guangzhou Secondary and Higher Education Schools Far Exceeds the Enrollment Quota - Vocational Schools Have Lower Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Guangzhou Office] The Zhongshan Daily recently reported on the problem of schooling for university and secondary school students, saying: "Guangzhou is an important town in South China, but its cultural level is much lower than that of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and there are very few schools. According to statistics, there are no more than one hundred public and private schools in the city. This pitiful number inevitably makes the parents of students anxious. In order to help parents understand the general situation of the schools, the reporter will make a simple report here for reference:</p>
<p>Universities</p>
<p>In the next semester, the universities in this city include National Zhongda University, Provincial College of Arts and Sciences, Provincial College of Law and Commerce, Private Lingnan University, Guangzhou University, National University, and China Cultural Academy. Statistically, the total enrollment quota of the above colleges is about 3,000. In addition, Beijing, Nankai, and Qinghua universities are also recruiting students in Guangzhou. These three universities are expected to recruit no more than 1,000 students nationwide, while the total number of students in this city who want to apply to universities is about 23,000, with a ratio of one to seven. Therefore, applying to universities next semester is quite difficult. Before applying, you must carefully select the schools and subjects and be fully prepared.</p>
<p>Secondary Schools</p>
<p>The provincial secondary schools include Zhongqin, Zhixin, Zhongyuan, Guangya, Zhongzheng, and Girls' Normal School. The municipal secondary schools include Municipal Normal School and Municipal No. 1 Secondary School. The private secondary schools include Pui Ching, Pui To, South China Attached High School, True Light, Concord, Pui Ying, Pui Kwai, South China, and Overseas Chinese and Changfeng. However, the tuition fees for private secondary schools will increase the burden on general parents in the next semester. The fees for each private school are roughly: 100 kilograms of rice for high school tuition, 25,000 yuan for tuition, and 25,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees; 80 kilograms of rice for junior high school tuition, 20,000 yuan for tuition, and 20,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees; 60 kilograms of rice for elementary school tuition and miscellaneous fees of 30,000 yuan. With this amount, if an ordinary family has several children in school, the burden on the parents' shoulders is truly unbearable. The "approximate number" for the tuition fees of private schools is of course a bit too high. Provincial schools only need to pay several thousand yuan in miscellaneous fees because they have government subsidies, but it will become a difficult problem when applying to schools. Vocational schools - the national vocational schools outside the province include Nanchang Zhongzheng Medical College and Wuchang Maritime Vocational School. The municipal vocational schools include Municipal No. 1 Vocational School. The private vocational schools include Accounting School and China Women's Vocational School. If you are interested in learning a specialized skill, applying to a vocational school is the best choice. The tuition fees of private vocational schools are generally affordable for parents from ordinary families.</p>

<h3>Q&amp;A on Household Registration Laws (Continued)</h3>
<p>(IV) Temporary Residence and Population Migration Registration (49) Question: Can the prevalent cohabitation of men and women be called marriage, and how should it be registered?</p>
<p>Answer: The distinction of households must be based on the length of residence. Although cohabiting men and women do not meet the conditions for marriage, the standard for establishing a household does not change accordingly. However, the head of the household should be determined by the permanent resident. If one of the men or women is a permanent resident of the place, they should be registered in the local register according to law. If they have another residence elsewhere and are only occasionally present, they cannot be considered members of the household at the cohabitation residence. If both parties are only occasionally present, they should be registered in the mobile household or temporary residence register according to the length of residence. (50) Question: Is it not necessary to obtain the permission of the supervisory authorities to set up a temporary household registration and remove a household registration from a register?</p>
<p>Answer: This is different from the provisions of Article 46 of the Household Registration Law and does not require the permission of the supervisory authorities.</p>
<p>(VI) Other</p>
<p>(11) Question: Can the Director of Household Registration use subpoenas when enforcing penalties?</p>
<p>Answer: The issuance of subpoenas is a judicial function, and autonomous organizations may not use them. When the Director of Household Registration enforces penalties, he/she should submit the cases to the District Office, County Government, or judicial authorities for approval, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Cotton Importers Hesitant After Suspension of Foreign Exchange Supply; Large Quantities of Indian Cotton Also Not Exchanged Normally</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank recently sent the 49th Notice to all designated foreign exchange banks, stating: The Central Bank has recently received reports that some importers are still importing raw materials from abroad without obtaining the Central Bank's permission. Therefore, the Central Bank hereby notifies all designated banks that if the import of the said raw cotton has not been approved by the Central Bank in advance, the designated banks must not sell foreign exchange. Any designated bank that violates this provision will be subject to the penalty of being suspended from operating foreign exchange business, and the importer will no longer be granted the convenience of settling foreign exchange. According to news from the import and export circles in this city: In recent weeks, some importers and manufacturers in this city have successively ordered as many as 100,000 bales of raw cotton from the United States, totaling 20 million US dollars. The Central Bank's sudden issuance of the 49th Notice is tantamount to putting all the said raw cotton orders on hold. It is reported that recently, importers have also ordered large quantities of raw cotton from India. The funds required to purchase the said raw cotton may not be obtained through the Central Bank, but through settlement in Hong Kong. The delivery procedures are always handled in this city, with payment in legal tender or Hong Kong dollars, or by private telegraphic transfer. In recent weeks, large quantities of Indian raw cotton have been traded through this transaction method without interference from the Central Bank. Therefore, some importers and manufacturers have also ordered raw cotton from the United States and Brazil at the same time. Importers and manufacturers believe that the consumption of raw cotton in this city is increasing day by day, and the Central Bank may consider supplying foreign exchange for the import of this batch of raw cotton. Judging from the Central Bank's 49th Notice, this expectation has obviously been dashed. The importers believe that since the Central Bank has not formally announced a ban on the import of raw cotton, and has tolerated the import of large quantities of Indian cotton, and has not stipulated in the regulations in advance that each new transaction of raw cotton must go through approval procedures, the importers have followed the large-scale import of Indian cotton and ordered raw cotton from the United States. It is also reported that before the issuance of the 49th Notice, importers could pay for the import of American cotton in US dollars, or by private telegraphic transfer. After this warning from the Central Bank, the designated banks will no longer be able to accept this method of settling payment.</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired about this matter from Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, who said: The Central Bank's 49th Notice was originally to reiterate the provisions of the notice issued by the bank on April 27 of this year. The previous notice had already stipulated that unless otherwise notified, the designated banks must not sell official foreign exchange for newly ordered raw cotton from now on. He said: At present, the inventory of raw cotton in this city is very sufficient and can be used until February of next year, so there is no need to import it again, so as to avoid wasting foreign exchange funds. Lin pointed out that the recent import of large quantities of Indian raw cotton and the indirect settlement method are illegal.</p>
<h3>Drawing of 13 Types of Government Bonds; Total of 269 Bonds Drawn; Numbers to be Published Separately in Newspapers</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance executed the August selection of principal drawing of various government bonds at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 10th) at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance's Government Bond Department, No. 74 Renji Road, 4th Floor. There were 13 types of government bonds, including Class A bonds of the 25th Year Unified Government Bond, Gold Bonds of the 27th Year (British and American Bonds), 1st and 2nd period bonds for the 29th Year Military Needs, 1st and 2nd period British, Gold, and US Dollar bonds for the 29th Year Construction Gold Government Bond, 1st period bonds of the 30th Year Construction Government Bond, the 30th Year Allied Victory US Dollar Government Bond, and National Salvation Government Bonds.

In addition to the representatives from the Audit Department and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Yinqian Trade Association supervising the drawing, and the representatives from the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong executing the drawing, people from all walks of life attended the event to observe.

<h3>Gold and Banknotes Stable; Hong Kong Dollars Continue to Be Popular; Rumor that Hong Kong Bans Exports</h3>
<p>The ingot continued to hover in the same place yesterday. It opened at 1.932 million in the morning. After opening, it first saw 1.925 million. Then, due to the registration and allocation relationship, the buying stopped slightly and fell slightly. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 40 bars, and the price was still 1.9175 million. After entering, it once fell back to 1.915 million. There were very few transactions, and it was difficult to cause a big change. At noon, it was still around 1.92 million. It rose slightly in the afternoon. As a result, it rose by 11,000 compared to the previous close. Gilded gold, patterned silver, and silver dollars remained unchanged. The underground discount rate was still 1.23. Supply and demand of funds were gradually balanced.</p>
<p>Only Hong Kong dollars continued to be popular among foreign currencies. US dollars were lifeless. They opened at 2,530 yuan in the morning with supply. They once retreated to 2,510 yuan. At noon, they hovered around 2,520 yuan. The situation was stable in the afternoon. As a result, they rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. There was demand for Hong Kong banknotes with little supply. It was rumored that Hong Kong prohibited the export of banknotes, resulting in a price that was more than 20 yuan higher than the Hong Kong exchange rate. As a result, it rose by another 10 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rate was 548 yuan to 553 yuan, with many transactions. The exchange rates of Indian, British, and American currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Weak</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks once showed some brilliance in the middle of the day, but it was only temporary. High prices were for Yongsha at 710 yuan, Maya at 3,900 yuan, Jingfu at 220 yuan, Xinguang at 220 yuan, and Qinxing at 162 yuan. Low prices near noon were for Yongsha at 688 yuan, Maya at 3,780 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang at 205 yuan, and Qinxing at 153 yuan. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks continued to show sluggishness. Major players entered and exited differently, and people still felt oppressed. They were all planning to close out their positions. Changes may come and there may be a longer period of hovering. As a result, Maya closed flat compared to the previous close, while Yongsha, Jingfu, and Xinguang all fell slightly. Qinxing was relatively stable. Some unpopular small and medium-sized stocks did not move, while others fell slightly. Veteran stocks continued to fall slightly. After closing, both Xinguang and Jingfu small stocks were bid up to above 220 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were still worried about being cold. They could not withstand the pressure of scattered supply. Large stocks still had one or two active players. Although they did not advance or retreat, cold stocks lacked maintenance and were showing signs of weakness. As a result, the steel industry and Yeguang each fell by more than half a percentage point compared to the previous close. Shipping and Jardine Matheson fell slightly. The rest lacked change.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Rose Slightly; More Buyers for Unified E Bonds</h3>
<p>Unified E Bonds, which have a long redemption period, had some buying activity. The rest were also slightly affected. Unified C Bonds rebounded from 620 yuan to above 650 yuan at the close, rising slightly by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. The same was true for A and B Bonds. D Bonds rose by 40 yuan, while E Bonds rose by 50 yuan alone.</p>
<h3>Rayon Strong and Outstanding</h3>
<p>Rayon, which had been rising for several days, was still strong and outstanding in the market yesterday. 120-count Tianqiao had light, and transactions were made at 1.63 million yuan. In the afternoon, bids were up by 10,000 yuan, which was 30,000 yuan more than the previous day. 120-count miscellaneous brands had light, and the asking price was also up by 20,000 yuan. 150-count had light, and 75-count semi-light were both bid up by 10,000 yuan. Only 120-count semi-light was not asked about and was still bid at the original price of the previous day. It is said that Hua Jin requires a lot of rayon for weaving. Meiya bedding silk saw a good price of 10,000 yuan. The holder of Hua Jin quoted a price of 2,100 yuan and finally traded at 2,070 yuan, which was 20 yuan more than the previous day.</p>
<h3>One Load of Cocoons is Equal to Three Loads of Rice; Standard Price for Autumn Cocoons</h3>
<p>Agricultural Bank Releases 1 Billion Yuan for Seed Loans</p>
<p>Government Purchases Autumn Silk</p>
<p>Regarding various issues related to autumn cocoons, officials, merchants, and Zhongling Company from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai carefully discussed and agreed that the determination of the price of autumn cocoons is a prerequisite for solving the problem of autumn cocoons. After various considerations, it was decided to take food as the standard, so as to avoid silkworm farmers being affected by price fluctuations and suffering losses. It was stipulated that the price of three loads of rice in the market would be converted into the price of one load of autumn cocoons. The price of autumn silkworm seeds is 2,000 yuan per new sheet and 1,500 yuan per old sheet. Please ask the Farmers Bank to lend 1 billion yuan for the purchase of seeds. In addition, manufacturers will subsidize 1,000 yuan per sheet so that seed merchants will not lose money. It is learned that 600,000 sheets of autumn silkworm seeds will be available for sale around the 20th of this month. It is also learned that the production costs of manufacturers were also discussed at this meeting. Because the loss for each load of silk is as high as 1.3 million to 1.4 million yuan, it is heard that the government will purchase autumn silk this year and give reasonable profits to the factories based on their costs to maintain the silk industry.</p>
<h3>Eligibility for Securities Exchange Brokers; Review Meeting Held Yesterday; Review to Continue Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Securities Market Preparatory Committee held its eighth preparatory committee meeting at the Securities Exchange Conference Room at 9:00 AM yesterday. All nine members of the committee and Secretary Chen Jisun attended. Throughout the day, the committee members reviewed the application forms of each broker that had been preliminarily reviewed by the subcommittee, and signed and noted their opinions.

It is heard that the full preparatory committee will continue to convene at noon on the 12th to continue the review.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Taiwan Sugar to Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Allocation Methods to Change; Price Remains the Same; Allocation Twice a Week; Associations, Cooperatives, and Foreign Trade Companies Apply</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, the company will ship 19,000 tons of sugar (approximately 200,000 bags) from Keelung, Taiwan, to Shanghai in the next three weeks. According to the scheduled date, the first batch of 9,000 tons of sugar, approximately 100,000 bags, will be shipped to Shanghai by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu wheel on the 18th of this month. The second and third batches of sugar, each of 5,000 tons, approximately 55,500 bags per batch, will be shipped by the Taiwan Shipping Company's Tainan transport and the Taiwan An Shipping Company's Taiwan An transport on the 26th of this month and the 2nd of next month, respectively. Therefore, the sugar inventory in this city will become more abundant.</p>
<p>The registration for the ninth phase of low-priced sugar ended on the 9th. Payment will be made on the 12th, and delivery will be made on the 14th and 15th. Generally, it will be available for widespread sale on the 17th. It is heard that a total of 26,910 bags of sugar will be allocated in the ninth phase, of which sugar merchants account for 10,000 bags, Southern goods industry accounts for 8,000 bags, and other tea and food industries, direct users, and foreign users account for 8,910 bags. The allocation price for this phase is exactly the same as that of the eighth phase. Therefore, the retail price is still 820 yuan per catty, and each person is limited to purchasing 3 catties. It is also heard that the method of allocating sugar by the Social Affairs Bureau will change slightly from the tenth phase, as follows: (1) Allocation will be made once every two weeks; (2) The total amount allocated for each phase will be determined by the Taiwan Sugar Company; (3) The allocation price will remain at 70,000 yuan per load and will not change for the time being; (4) The allocation targets are divided into two types: local and foreign. The local target will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in consultation with the Taiwan Sugar Company based on the actual situation, and the allocation will be approved separately within the quota. The targets are industry associations and registered consumer cooperatives. Other stores and factories should directly request from the Taiwan Sugar Company. The inspection and assessment of the sales situation of industry associations will be handled jointly by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Taiwan Sugar Company.</p>
<h3>Diminishing Stock of Export Tea; British Trading Houses Go to Hangzhou for Procurement</h3>
<p>Upon investigation, the old export tea mostly consists of what has been shelved since the Pacific War. Consequently, the quality has inevitably deteriorated. Occasionally, a small number of teas with relatively good body are still found. In recent days, exporters, seeing the favorable prices, have been scouring them all. However, although buyers continue to have demand, the market inventory of tea suitable for export is exceedingly scarce. Purchasers are therefore flocking to Hangzhou to select and purchase tea. According to news from that area, British firms Jardine Matheson and Carlowitz are currently examining samples and making offers. It is also heard that Carlowitz has already secured over 400 cases of old Anhui Keemun tea at a price of 75,000 yuan per dan (approx. 50 kg). Market sentiment is stable, and the future prospects may continue to rise. As for trading in local foreign firms, yesterday, Wu Chang Tea Company presented and drew samples of high-grade Chun Zhen, Zhen Mei, and Zhen Zhen Mei teas, totaling over 320 cases. China Tea Company purchased 150 cases of black tea and 120 cases of new Bai Lin tea. The process remained largely unchanged. However, new Bai Lin black tea has plummeted by more than half per dan compared to the opening price. Yet, due to quality considerations, the trend is subtly flat amidst an apparent decline. In addition, domestic sales of red and green teas are brisk. Wang Yu Tai Tea House took in 120 dan of freshly pan-fired green tea from Wenzhou at a price of 50,000 to 52,000 yuan per dan. Furthermore, old Shao Pan-fried Bao Zhong tea and new Longjing tea are favored by many, and prices have consistently remained good.</p>
<h3>Tight New Rice Supply; Market Conditions Unlikely to Return to Normal</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the north and south markets saw the arrival of six to seven thousand shi (石, approx. 100 kg) of rice. Retailers are gradually selling their shares, with high-grade rice remaining firm and medium- to low-grade rice rising by 8,000 yuan. The supply of new japonica rice is scarce, adding 1,000 yuan, and white rice also rose by over 1,000 yuan. However, supply and demand are still balanced. Early-season new indica rice is currently being harvested. If the supply increases, market conditions may improve. Flour from the "Sailor Brand" is actively traded, while old "Cannon Cart" flour remains mediocre, and miscellaneous brands are unchanged. Very little wheat is being traded privately. High-grade wheat sees some transactions, while medium- to low-grade continues to weaken by 300 to 500 yuan and lacks customers. Factories have no demand due to low flour prices. Soybeans from producing regions are firmly expensive. The supply of new soybeans is slightly scarce, and retailers are opportunistically buying, causing prices to rise by 1,000 yuan. Old soybeans also increased by 500 to 600 yuan. Raw kernels are steady. In the oil market, the arrival of soybean oil is sporadic, and supply cannot meet demand. Summer consumption is robust, and prices have risen by over 1,000 yuan, causing soybean and rapeseed oil prices to rise as well. However, it was learned at noon that vegetable oil factories will continue to distribute oil, so market sentiment softened at the close. Soybean cake sales are slow, weakening by 100 yuan. Bran prices are similar.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Foreign Rice to Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Sanbei Company's "Ming Xing" vessel departed for Hankou this afternoon, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice (approximately 400 tons), 8,000 bags of flour, and 1,060 bags of cement, all of which are relief supplies. In addition, 500 tons of waste cotton and cotton textiles are being transported to Los Angeles on the Shun Hing Foreign Firm's "Glenfarvel," managed by (manager's name). It is heard that a large shipment of tea and pig bristles, etc., will be transported to New York next week.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Stop Falling and Rise; Cotton and Cloth Transactions Are Still Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw a slight improvement. Dealers did not take large quantities, only making small additions. Traders became more optimistic, with rumors of prices for 20-count yarn from all brands, both large and small factories, rising by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. Yarn factories are offering a considerable amount for sale. Dasheng Yarn Factory released a large quantity of Hong Kui Xing and Cai Kui Xing brands. In addition, Shen Xin No. 3 Factory offered about 100 pieces of 20-count super-grade yarn as futures, priced at 1.24 million yuan. Market sentiment seems to have stabilized, and the trend is no longer as fragile as in previous days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton futures continued to rise by over 20 points. The recent price was US$36.07, the new crop futures price was US$32.86, and the spot price was US$36.88 (a new high). The local spot market is becoming increasingly firm, with good transactions. Shen Xin No. 1 Factory and Tong Yi, along with smaller factories, continued to take quantities, causing market prices to rise by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Ningbo and Fujian merchants are rushing to buy for shipment, while spot goods are lacking in the market, so the upward pressure is stronger. Civilian-run factory fine cloth is being continuously purchased from the South China region. However, due to the off-season, the market for printed cloth is declining daily. Native-made cloth is gradually improving, with each bolt of cloth rising by 250 to 1,000 yuan. At noon, Fang Jian Company opened for sales as usual. The price of ton-sized drills remains unchanged. Ningbo drills rose by 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Exchange Membership Worth US$78,000</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] Yesterday, a New York Stock Exchange membership was sold for US$78,000, an increase of US$1,000 from the previous price. Generally, a stock exchange seat is priced at US$75,000 for the bid and US$79,000 for the ask.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Spot Sugar; Single Bags Trading Over 120,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, with a slight increase in transactions. The guild opened with Shantou merchants offering high-grade green sugar at 95,000 yuan, washed green sugar at 93,500 to 93,000 yuan, and high-grade red sugar at 127,000 yuan, followed by 123,000 yuan, with a total of over 300 bags transacted. Xinghua merchants offered 50 baskets of Gongfen white sugar at 130,000 yuan. Jian merchants offered 50 bags of Diaoqing sugar at 88,000 yuan. Wenzhou sugar is due to high cost and thin inventory so the price did not follow restrictions. Single bags traded above 122,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Opening of Huazhong Enterprise Company</h3>
<p>Huada Enterprise Co., Ltd. will officially open on the 12th (tomorrow). Zhang Xingbai is the chairman of the board, and Li Huaqing is the general manager. In addition to managing existing import and export businesses, it will also establish a shipping department to handle the sale, transportation, and navigation of ocean and inland river vessels of all sizes.</p>
<h3>Forward Exchange Contracts Invalidate if Not Settled; Consider Before Ordering</h3>
<p>The Central Bank has stipulated that forward exchange contracts must be settled within three months. Whether purchasing machinery, industrial raw materials, or other goods, if the exchange is not settled by the due date, the contract will be invalidated, and the designated bank will reclaim the exchange bill. This regulation remains unchanged. According to a person in charge at the Central Bank, importers should be confident in their orders beforehand. If goods cannot be delivered by the due date or transportation problems cannot be resolved, they should carefully consider this in advance and not act rashly. The Central Bank will absolutely not allow failure to settle exchange by the due date. Furthermore, it is also learned that designated banks may allow merchants to apply for an extension if there are special reasons and foreign telegrams can provide proof.</p>
<h3>Yongli Company Continues Efforts; Borrows US$16 Million to Establish Eight Major Factories in Major Cities</h3>
<p>Yongli Chemical Industries Corporation is planning to establish eight major factories to develop China's chemical industry: (1) Shanghai Bakelite Factory, (2) Qingdao Electrolytic Caustic Soda Factory, (3) Nanjing Ammonium Sulfate Factory, (4) Nanjing Ammonia Factory, (5) Hunan Cement Factory, (6) Hunan Glass Factory, (7) Hunan Coking Factory, (8) Xiangtan Ammonia Factory. It plans to establish five factories next year and begin production. It is heard that the Nanjing Ammonia Factory previously received a loan of 3.6 billion from the Four Banks Joint Office and has partially begun construction. The company recently borrowed US$16 million from the US Export-Import Bank to actively establish the Xiangtan Ammonia Factory. Mr. Yang Zhongfu, the manager of the Central China region, has gone to Hunan to oversee the project. The loan will be repaid with interest after sixteen years, and the interest rate is extremely low.</p>
<p>A management office has been established in the Hankou area to develop business. The reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the factory, who stated that the company was founded by Fan Xudong in 1917 and is located in Tanggu, Tianjin. The scale is vast, producing around 200 tons of soda ash per day, as well as chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and ammonia. During the war, the Tianjin factory was seized by the enemy. The main factory was moved to Wutongqiao, Sichuan, which is a mixed-product facility producing cement, caustic soda, and other products, but in small quantities. After the war, the Tanggu factory was taken over and restarted, producing 100 tons of soda ash per day. It is expected that once all production equipment has been installed by the end of the year, it will reach pre-war production levels. The company's business operations are divided into five major regions: East China, Central China, South China, West China, and North China. Among them, North China has the most popular products. The Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory alone requires 30 tons of soda ash per day.</p>

<h3>Paying Tribute to the Loyal Souls at Meihua Ridge</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper, Yangzhou, 7th. Special Correspondent: Wang Gongwo</p>
<p>While casually reading "Ten Days in Yangzhou" by Wang Xiuchu of the Ming Dynasty, I couldn't help but think of Shi Kefa, the loyal hero of the era, Ming Supervisor, Minister of War, and Grand Scholar of Dongge. At the same time, I calculated that from the Ming Hongguang year of Jia Shen (the year of the Ming Dynasty's demise) to the present, it has been over three hundred years since Duke Shi sacrificed himself for the greater good.</p>
<p>The Old and New Sorrows of a Loyal Hero</p>
<p>In another book, I reacquainted myself with the hateful history of those who betrayed the Ming Dynasty: "The main reason for the Ming Dynasty's demise was not external troubles, but internal strife." Furthermore, from the current reality of China, I have a thought: If some of China's current "heroes" still want to be called "heroes" and spare no effort to ignite the fires of internal strife everywhere, causing our country and nation to miss the rare opportunity for revival and construction, then no matter who is in power in the future, no matter who is more "democratic," "progressive," or "enlightened," in the absence of sufficient modern national conditions and under time constraints, China will ultimately be nominally but not truly strong—in other words, at most, a modern "vassal state."</p>
<p>It was with such feelings of old and new sorrow that I visited Meihua Ridge, the location of the cenotaph of the martyr "Duke Shi Zhongzheng," to pay tribute to the loyal soul of Supervisor Shi.</p>
<p>Biography of Duke Shi in the Yangzhou Prefecture Chronicle</p>
<p>Before recounting the process of paying tribute, I think it is necessary to examine Shi Kefa's background. I remember that Yi Junzuo, the author of "Idle Talk of Yangzhou" before the war, had a record in his "Collection of Stories of National Heroes," and the standalone "Shi Kefa" published by Zhengzhong Bookstore had an even more detailed record. However, the space here may not allow for that. Below, we will simply copy a passage from the "Yangzhou Prefecture Chronicle":</p>
<p>"Biography of the Loyal and Upright: Shi Kefa, courtesy name Xianzhi, was from Daxing, Shuntian. His mother, Madam Yin, dreamed of Wen Tianxiang entering her house when she was pregnant, and then Kefa was born. In the Chongzhen reign, he became a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations); he rose through the ranks to Right Vice Censor-in-Chief, patrolling and pacifying Anqing, Luzhou, and other places. He requested the exemption of disaster-stricken farmlands from taxation, recruited brave soldiers, repaired fortifications, and planned for war and defense day and night, so the rebels avoided his front. In the fourteenth year, he became Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue and General Transport Commissioner. Soon after, he was appointed Minister of War in Nanjing. In the seventeenth year, the fourth month, upon hearing that Li Zicheng had captured the capital, he grieved greatly! He struck his head against a pillar, and blood flowed all over his body. He wore mourning clothes and prepared to avenge the dynasty. When Prince Fu (reporter's note: i.e., Emperor Hongguang) was established, Ma Shiying led his troops in. Kefa knew that the situation was irreconcilable and requested to supervise the army in Huaiyang; he was awarded the title of Grand Protector of the Heir Apparent, Minister of War, and Grand Scholar of Wuyingdian. At that time, Gao Jie's troops were stationed in Yangzhou, and countless people were plundered and killed. Kefa submitted a memorial to have Gao Jie's troops stationed at Guazhou to pacify Yangzhou. Kefa then opened his office in Yangzhou, welcoming the virtuous and talented. He repeatedly requested funding, but Shiying refused to provide it; every time he requested to punish the rebels, he shed tears in the court. He was obstructed by Ma and Ruan (reporter's note: Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng were both treacherous officials at the end of the Ming Dynasty). On the twentieth day, Qing (reporter's note: the original text is in large characters, which the reporter has changed, and the same below) troops arrived and camped at Banzhuyuan. General Li Xifeng and Military Supervisor Gao Qifeng abandoned the camp and surrendered, and the situation in the city became more isolated. Various civil and military officials divided the defensive positions; the west gate of the old city was the most dangerous, and Kefa defended it himself. He wrote a letter to his mother and wife as a farewell. Since he had no son, he appointed Vice General Shi Dewei as his heir. Two days later, Qing troops attacked the city. The city was breached, and Kefa tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat, but failed. He ordered Dewei to kill him, but Dewei wept in pain and dared not look up. An adjutant pushed him out of the small east gate and was captured by Qing troops. Kefa shouted: 'I am Supervisor Shi, kill me quickly.' They tried to persuade him to surrender, but he refused and was killed. Ren Minyu, the prefect of Yangzhou, Qu Wei, the assistant prefect, Luo Fulong, the Lianghuai salt transport commissioner, Yang Zhenxi, Wu Daozheng, the magistrate in charge of supplies, Wang Zhiduan, the county magistrate of Jiangdu, Hu Ritianxing, a staff member, and Lu Wei all died with him."</p>
<p>With so many martyrs who died together, I felt that it was my duty to go to Meihua Ridge to pay tribute.</p>
<p>Minister's Plaque, "The Spirit Shakes Mountains and Rivers"</p>
<p>The ridge is located outside the Guangchu Gate of Yangzhou City—but the so-called ridge is actually just a small hill. Shi's ancestral hall is built beside the ridge, with more than ten rooms to the east, containing the "Meihua Immortal Hall," Shi's portrait, and many stone tablets. To the west are three large rooms. The cenotaph is located in the center of the ancestral hall, surrounded by pine and cypress trees and a wooden fence. A tall stone tablet stands in front of the hall, inscribed with the words "Tomb of Shi Kefa, Ming Supervisor, Minister of War, and Grand Scholar of Dongge."</p>
<p>I left through Tianning Gate (Guangchu Gate had been closed before the war), headed east along the river, and soon reached my destination. As I stepped through the gate, what immediately caught my eye, as expected, was that while the outer shells of the buildings in the ancestral hall were still intact, all the interior decorations were in a state of disrepair! In the courtyard in front of the main hall, I remembered that there were several pine and cypress trees before the war, but they were gone. However, a plaque with the golden characters "The Spirit Shakes Mountains and Rivers" on the beam in front of the main hall still existed. It seemed that it was offered by Minister He Yingqin when Mr. Wang Maoru (Bailing), a member of the Central Committee, raised funds to repair the ancestral hall in 1935.</p>
<p>Red Plum, Scorching Sun, Lush Weeds</p>
<p>I walked through the courtyard, passed through the hall, and reached the cenotaph. The cenotaph was as solemn as before. I stood in silent respect in front of it. The caretaker of the ancestral hall came to guide me and told me that General Bai Chongxi and Minister Hong Lanyou had come here to pay tribute on the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month last year. The military officers stationed in the city also often came to pay tribute. Then, he led me to Meihua Ridge. After a few steps, I looked around and the situation was even worse! The garden, which had thousands of red plum trees planted before the war, had become overgrown with weeds. The hexagonal pavilion and the iron cannon cast during the Zhenghua era, both relics of the past, were gone. The plum trees on the ridge were just two or three withered black trunks exposed to the scorching sun, which was a very depressing sight!</p>
<p>The Last Farewell Letter</p>
<p>The "Stele Pavilion" on the ridge still exists, and the stone stele embedded in the wall is still intact. I had a rubbing of Shi Kefa's last farewell letter before the war. But now, when I asked the caretaker, not even the person in charge of the ancestral hall had a copy. Reading the letter is incredibly tragic, so I copied it from the stele, with the full text and format as follows:</p>
<p>"Respectfully awaiting</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>Madam Yang</p>
<p>Wishing you ten thousand blessings! Northern troops surrounded Yangzhou on the 18th, and have not attacked yet, but people's hearts have already left, and cannot be recovered. I will die sooner or later, I do not know whether Madam is willing to follow me? In such a world, it is useless to live, it is better to decide early. Madam is troubled, must entrust Fourth Master and Master, San Ke, everyone to take care of, (reporter's note: Shi's daughter) Zhao'er, good or bad, let it be, writing this, my heart is breaking! April 21st, Fa sends"</p>
<p>The First Masterpiece After the Chu Shi Biao</p>
<p>Also, in Shi Kefa's letter to Regent Dorgon, his loyalty is evident in every word, and the cleanliness and magnificence of the text is said to be the first masterpiece after the "Chu Shi Biao," which is not an exaggeration. However, it is difficult to copy the original text from the stone stele because the handwriting is cursive and difficult to distinguish, and there are more than two thousand characters.</p>
<p>Two Couplets and a Portrait</p>
<p>From the Stele Pavilion, I went to the place where Shi Kefa's portrait was enshrined. Mr. Jia, the person in charge of the ancestral hall, specially took out a precious original portrait for me to view. We talked about how the ancestral hall needed to be renovated inside and out when the situation stabilized, but where would the funds come from? ... etc. I also copied two good couplets: "In life, he had Wen Tianxiang's integrity; in death, he had Wu Xianghou's loyalty." "A few drops of plum blossom, tears for a fallen nation; a sliver of moonlight, the heart of a former official." Chanting these two couplets, I bid farewell to the loyal soul and left Meihua Ridge.</p>
<h3>Municipal Administration in Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 2nd. Reporter: Li Chi</p>
<p>Although "Seven Waters Surrounding Chang'an" is a thing of the past, it is hoped that mechanical power can be used to resolve the water supply problem and promote municipal development.</p>
<p>In hot weather, the need for water is especially unforgettable. Xi'an, the ancient capital that once flourished in the arid loess region, has indeed had convenient and abundant water sources, as documented in historical records. The saying "Seven Waters Surrounding Chang'an" is not a falsehood. The flow of these seven waters can still be traced today. Unfortunately, due to poor human management, the deep and wide riverbeds have become increasingly shallow, and some have even dried up year-round and become historical sites. How to restore a sufficient water supply is indeed an important issue for current municipal administration and a prerequisite for future municipal development. Because water is not only related to the health of citizens, but also its sufficient supply restricts the density of the urban population, the construction of high-rise buildings, and the development of certain industrial sectors. The following event currently illustrates the negative impact: Since the beginning of July, Xi'an's power plant has stopped supplying electricity due to a coal shortage, so ordinary households' electric lights and fans are out, and Xi'an's ice factory is also affected, and the drinking water that countless citizens have relied on the ice factory's water extraction equipment to supply has immediately quadrupled in price. We watch year-round as water carts pulled by humans and animals walk around the city to supply a portion of the population with drinking water, which is almost considered a "treasure." Unless this situation improves, other excellent conditions for developing the city will remain limited. Just think: Can such a situation be allowed to continue? A low-level public school employee's entire monthly income is not enough for him to go to the bathhouse every other day!</p>
<h3>Pacification Work Unfolded in Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 3rd, Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a typhoon swept in, scattering the heatwave! In recent days, it has rained almost every night, making this southern coastal province seem particularly peaceful. Here, in the local news sections of all newspapers, there are not only no shocking stories, but not even particularly stimulating news. However, even in this peaceful atmosphere, there are things worth reporting: the provincial authorities have recently been actively planning and promoting various measures related to public order, food supply, and transportation.</p>
<p>Allowing Bandits to Surrender</p>
<p>Complete Extermination After the Deadline</p>
<p>Let's talk about public order first. In the past, before the CCP armed forces had withdrawn, many local bandits claimed to be affiliated with the CCP, which greatly hindered the government's efforts to suppress banditry. Moreover, the CCP leaders have stated that there are no more communist troops in Guangdong, which naturally makes bandit suppression in the province much smoother. Therefore, the authorities decided on a province-wide pacification plan. During the pacification period, bandits would be allowed to surrender. If they remain unrepentant after the deadline, large-scale searches and exterminations would be carried out by district. These operations would be the responsibility of the National Army and security forces stationed in the area. At the same time, orders were given to establish special agencies in each extermination zone to implement rural cleansing work, improve the Baojia system, and distribute weapons and ammunition to strengthen the people's self-defense forces. Director Zhang Fakui of the Command Headquarters personally inspected the northeast in the past month and designated the counties in each extermination zone: the inter-provincial area between Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi included seven counties in Guangdong: Heping, Lianping, Nanxiong, Wengyuan, Shixing, Qujiang, and Renhua; two counties in Hunan: Guidong and Rucheng; and ten counties in Jiangxi: Nankang, Xinfeng, Anyuan, Xunwu, Jiudu, Longnan, and Dayu. Within this area, each administrative district would form a rural cleansing supervisory committee composed of party, government, and military leaders and local gentry, and each county would form a rural cleansing work group. The Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi border area would focus on the areas around Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Dabu, Raoping, Yongding, Shanghang, and Shaoan, and a Han River Cleansing Committee would be established in the East River area, with the county magistrates serving as members responsible for cleansing. As for Qiongya (Hainan Island), it could be said to be the area with the most rampant banditry, with an estimated four thousand bandits gathered there. Provincial Chairman Luo, accompanied by Deputy Commander of the Security Forces Wei Zhenfu, visited Qiongya for inspection and convened a pacification meeting. Recently, it was decided to send additional security forces to the area for encirclement and suppression, and a Qiongya Command Post of the Security Headquarters would be established, with Deputy Commander Wei Zhenfu serving as commander, while also supporting local civilian armed forces to assist. It is estimated that the total armed force can be increased by 20,000 after the reorganization of civilian armed forces throughout the province. This pacification plan is scheduled to begin on August 1st, with a deadline of two months to eliminate the remaining bandits. It is believed that after this thorough suppression of bandits, the security of Guangdong province will be further consolidated.</p>
<p>Forming an Administrative Supervision Group</p>
<p>Inspecting the Actual Situation in Various Places</p>
<p>Regarding provincial administration, the most important task is the establishment of an administrative supervision group by the provincial government last month. Led by members of the provincial government, personnel from the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education, as well as the Land and Food Bureau, would depart for seven districts to conduct supervision. Their tasks are: (1) Focusing on past tax collection and providing guidance for the operation of the new financial system in the future. (2) Supervising the preparation work for the collection of land tax in kind. (3) Assessing the current state of the local Baojia system and improving its organization. (4) Repairing highway transportation. (5) Assessing the progress of relief work. (6) Assessing the current state of relief and education and the methods for improvement and promotion in the future. (7) Maintaining public order and civilian self-defense forces. (8) The current status of various prohibitions. In addition to these eight items, they will also investigate corruption and the general economic and social trends of the area. Starting from the 15th of last month, the supervision groups in each district have departed one after another.</p>
<p>Increased Grain Production Next Year</p>
<p>Self-Sufficiency is Expected</p>
<p>As for the grain issue in this province, many people are probably concerned. As reported last time by the reporter, the rice shortage crisis in this province seems to have been safely overcome. However, this province is still a grain-deficient province, and this year, the uneven rainfall has affected the harvest significantly, and investigations in various rivers show that there is no bumper harvest. According to statistics, the total amount of grain needed in the province in the second half of the year is about 15 million dan. Although, in terms of short-term measures, the authorities have already taken measures such as purchasing rice from other provinces to aid Guangdong, storing rural grains for famine relief, and continuing to promote conservation. However, these measures can probably only solve the problem for this year. But if we want to be self-sufficient in the future, the fundamental thing is still to promote farmland irrigation and actively cultivate wasteland to increase production. Therefore, this item is listed as the most important task in the province's five-year plan. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry is actively planning this. Recently, it borrowed 180,000 yuan from the Agricultural Bank of China for the need to build water conservancy projects and irrigate fields in various places, and urged various counties to strictly implement the "One Bao, One Pond" movement. At the same time, according to the report, 314 barrels of seeds have been shipped, and 2,000 tons of fertilizer have arrived in Kowloon. This province is expected to receive 15,000 tons of fertilizer, which will be shipped and applied successively. As for the pesticide powder, part of it has also arrived. In addition, there are 1,500 sets of agricultural tools on the way to Guangdong... If this report is credible, then it will be of great help to increase grain production. It is estimated that at most next year, the grain in this province will be self-sufficient, and no longer need to rely on foreign countries!</p>
<p>Proposed Repair of Main Highway Lines</p>
<p>Approximately 8,000 Kilometers</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning the current state of transportation construction in this province. In terms of railways, the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Guangzhou-Sanshui, and Guangdong-Hankou railways have all resumed traffic. At present, the authorities believe that the most important task in transportation is the restoration of the main highway lines in the province. It is estimated that the province originally had 14,518 kilometers of highways, and after the wartime damage, only 417 kilometers of passable roads remained, which is less than one thirty-fifth of the original. Due to inconvenient transportation, this has a great impact on the economic construction of the province. According to the plan of the Highway Bureau, a total of 8,200 kilometers of highways should be repaired, including 3,970.7 kilometers of main lines connecting the province's important cities and towns, 2,927.9 kilometers of lines connecting international ports, and 1,321.6 kilometers of main lines connecting other provinces. However, because the project is huge and requires a total of 42,385,107,797 yuan in construction funds, and the central government's subsidies have not yet been allocated immediately, in order to meet the urgent needs of reconstruction, it is only possible to first repair the main transportation sections with available financial resources to restore traffic. The main highway lines that have been repaired are Guangzhou-Shaoguan, Guanxing, Shaoyu, Xiongxin, Guangzeng, Denghebo, Meishan, Wengqian, and Shaoxiao. According to Xie Delong Wenlong, Director of the Department of Construction, the provincial treasury is unable to provide enough funds, and the central government has not provided much subsidy. In the future, it is planned to support merchants to build the two major east-west highways on the coast of this province, with Guangzhou as the center point. The west line will go through Foshan, Jiangmen, Heshan, Enping, Taishan, Yangjiang, Dianbai, Shuidong, and end at Haian City, the southernmost end of the Leizhou Peninsula. The east line will go from this city through Dongguan, Huiyang, Haifeng, Lufeng, Kuitan, Huilai, and other places to Shantou, and then go out to Fujian. Some sections of these two highways are already open to traffic, and some sections have already been prepared. The current promotion of construction is only to ensure that they can be connected to each other. From this point of view, the highway transportation in this province will have considerable progress in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Han Xueqi asks: Your department handles social service affairs, answers various questions free of charge, and provides convenience to readers, which is admirable. The reason is that I deposited 200 yuan of savings accumulated from my hard work into the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank for a ten-year fixed savings in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). The term has long expired, but it is still repaid according to the original number of foreign currency at the legal tender rate. At a time when prices have exceeded pre-war levels by thousands of times, the hundreds of yuan received are equivalent to zero. May I ask: I think I am not the only small depositor of this kind (Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng had a proposal on the above question at the Second Plenary Session, which was explained in detail. Your newspaper also published it, but no resolution was published.) Does the government have any regulations for the return of the above savings to form its own method, and whether the government has referred to the price index and increased any multiple of repayment? Or are there any actual cases of legal judgments of this kind of dispute that can be used as a reference? It concerns the interests of a large number of working-class depositors. Please give us a clear indication.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Reference should be made to those who supplement the fairness of litigation after restoration. The court should make a fair judgment and increase or decrease the payment. (2) Chen Jinglei asks Editor: Readers Shi Di Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, four people, the inheritance of their late father should be equally divided into four shares, but because the Shi Di are scattered during the war, it has not been analyzed yet, and Jia is temporarily in charge. Within a few years, Jia will first allocate all public property to Jia's account, and then sell it off one after another. When Yi Bingding returns from the rear, they are in a homeless place. I would like to ask you to answer the questions. (1) Jia has sold all of the late father's inheritance, which has not yet been analyzed. Are the various contracts signed by the business operator and Jia all valid? (2) Jia changed the name of the public property to Jia's account, and Jia sold it in person. Are the contracts signed valid? (3) If the business operator has arrived at the household, can Yi Bingding sue the court to recover the property rights? (4) If the business operator has not arrived at the household, can Yi Bingding hire a lawyer to post in the local newspaper, declaring it invalid, and notify the business operator in writing to request it within a deadline? (5) The business operator and the land are located in Changxing, Zhejiang, and Yi Bingding are all from Yixing, Jiangsu. Can they file a lawsuit in Xuanhe court and transfer jurisdiction without having to go to Changxing to sue? (6) Yi Bingding has asked the local district town office gentlemen to mediate several times, but the business operator ignores them. Can they be sent to the local authorities to transfer to the Yixing court for prosecution, which is relatively simple?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Invalid (2) Invalid (3) You can sue to recover property rights (4) Yes (5) You should file a lawsuit in the court where the real estate is located, because it is an exclusive jurisdiction and you cannot request a change. (6) Since mediation is ineffective, a lawsuit should be filed in the Changxing District Court of Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(3) Yin Xizhi of Yixing asks: "There is a pavilion, please give instructions: "There is a building, the downstairs belongs to B, and the second floor belongs to A. It was destroyed by war during the Anti-Japanese War. Can Party A now have the right to require Party B to fulfill the old contract and rebuild it?"</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] You can request Party B to fulfill the original contract.</p>

<h3>Dredging or Filling of Tudui and Stinky Hamlets: Explanation from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works</h3>
<p>Regarding the article "Tudui and Stinky Hamlets Should Be Filled Within a Time Limit" published in the social service column of your newspaper on July 30, we hereby reply as follows: After investigation, there are many waterways in this city that are used to discharge ditch water. Therefore, we are currently investigating the various rivers and hamlets, and selecting those related to drainage to dredge them as much as possible within the scope of financial burden (such as Fahua Hamlet, Zhaojiabang Hamlet, and Zhuanan Hamlet have been deepened) to make the water flow smoothly. Those that are irrelevant to drainage and can be filled will be filled in as soon as they are completed. If they cannot be filled without burying pipes, they can only be handled in phases depending on the severity of the situation due to financial constraints. However, residents near the rivers and hamlets must not dump garbage and feces to pay attention to hygiene. As for the Tudui problem, it is now under the management of the Hygiene Bureau and is reported separately for filling or elimination. Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works.</p>

<h3>The Urgent Need to Resolve the Land Problem in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Ge Kexin</p>
<p>Since the end of the war against Japan, Northern Jiangsu has not seen a single day of true peace, even as the first anniversary of the victory approaches. Initially, there were only the National Revolutionary Army and the enemy forces. Gradually, countless guerrilla bands emerged, and then the "New Fourth Army" arose. Later, the guerrillas, unable to withstand the joint attacks from the enemy and the "New Fourth Army," eventually transformed into puppet troops in some cases. The National Revolutionary Army faced off against the enemy, guerrilla bands encroached upon each other, and the "New Fourth Army" fought with both guerrilla bands and the National Revolutionary Army. The National Revolutionary Army, isolated in Northern Jiangsu and lacking external supplies, had to rely on the local population for provisions. The enemy, adhering to the principle of "using war to sustain war," constantly requisitioned military grain. Surrendered troops, feigning allegiance, sought food and supplies. The "New Fourth Army" also extracted what they called "public grain" from the common people. Aside from the various disturbances and losses suffered during battles, these frequent and diverse burdens undoubtedly squeezed the last drop of blood from every farmer in Northern Jiangsu! However, under powerful oppression, and especially for the sake of the sacred national war, the farmers of Northern Jiangsu silently endured. Who knew that after victory, they would face even more widespread and cruel disasters than before?</p>
<p>The "New Fourth Army" in Northern Jiangsu clearly gained a foothold and grew stronger by taking advantage of the wartime chaos and certain undeniable political weaknesses. After the "New Fourth Army" expanded, the entire Northern Jiangsu region, except for a few "points" with relatively convenient transportation, seemed to have been occupied and controlled by it, taken separately from the National Revolutionary Army, guerrilla bands, puppet troops, and even surrendered enemies. They strengthened "struggles" and introduced some so-called "great turnaround" measures. Slogans and punishments that confused people are set aside for the moment. What needs to be specifically pointed out is the changes imposed on the land by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Regardless of the CCP's labels—whether "liquidation," "rent reduction," "grain fines," or confiscation of the property of traitors, "quasi-traitors," and "traitor descendants"—they ultimately cannot conceal the predatory and violent changes imposed on the land. I agree with any scholar or party that holds the ideal of land redistribution, but I firmly oppose the CCP's approach in Northern Jiangsu. A few days ago, Madame Sun Song Qingling, in her opinion on the current situation, stated, "The Principle of People's Livelihood today means that the people can no longer suffer from hunger," with "the land problem must be reasonably resolved" and "the Kuomintang must fulfill its historical mission—land reform." No one can deny that she is right; however, in the actual implementation of land reform, the Kuomintang and the CCP have significant differences in methods. The CCP's approach in Northern Jiangsu is neither "supporting the Three Principles of the People" nor implementing communism. Its so-called land revolution, at least in the current stage, is merely a means to achieve some other objective. If Madame Sun Song Qingling could recognize this fact, I think she would have some new feelings, sympathize with the "Northern Jiangsu refugees" who have been driven out, and certainly believe that these "people" whose right to survival has been denied by the CCP should also "have the right to rise up against hunger."</p>
<p>I will not debate the responsibility for the current turmoil in Northern Jiangsu. I want to discuss the fact that the current military situation in Northern Jiangsu is rapidly changing, accompanied by inevitable political changes, and the most important point is undoubtedly the handling of the land problem. Over the past few years, the land in Northern Jiangsu under the control of the CCP has obviously undergone some changes. Confiscations have been carried out, and distributions have been made. When this issue comes into our hands, we must ask: What should be done?</p>
<p>The CCP's measures regarding land in Northern Jiangsu can be explained in the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Land confiscated without compensation is resold to farmers. – As mentioned earlier, the CCP has confiscated a lot of land. For the original landlords, they are given a crime, but no other compensation is provided. Then, the land is resold to some people. I wonder if those who are not CCP members or not involved in "militia" "military relatives" have no right to buy or do they not dare to ask about it? Because, according to what we know, few honest farmers really buy such land. As for the sale price of these lands, there is no fixed standard. The compensation paid by the buyer goes entirely to the CCP. However, there are also those who get land without paying a price, which is naturally used by the CCP as "granted land."</p>
<p>(2) Landlords are forced to sell land in the name of "grain fines." – The so-called landlords, who have long been harassed and exploited, have already reached the end of their rope. Today, there is a "rent reduction," and tomorrow, there is a "liquidation." As a result, they are ordered to "fine grain" to get things done. After receiving the order, the landlords have to hand over the amount of grain stipulated by the order. Therefore, they have to sell their land at a low price and buy enough food at a high price to fill the fine. In this way, it is like a sharp pair of scissors, forcing the poor landlords to continuously sell land at a low price until they sell out or can only retain three to five acres. But there are two situations that must be explained: (A) When the landlords find a buyer, mediate through intermediaries, and sign a contract for sale, this is relatively fair. (B) When the CCP "cadres" or members dictate the price, the landlords have no room for bargaining. It goes without saying that the landlords will suffer losses. Regardless of which of the above methods or purchase and sale cooperation is used, because of the transfer of ownership, the buyer must complete the tax deed formalities. The price is well-known.</p>
<p>(3) Distribution by population – This is a new method that has only been in place since February of this year, and it is less practiced in areas such as Rugao, Taixing, and Jingjiang. We cannot penetrate deeply into the CCP-controlled areas, so we have no way of knowing the details.</p>
<p>If we acknowledge the above as facts, it is not difficult to come to the conclusion: First, according to communism, private land ownership is not recognized. However, in Northern Jiangsu, except for the third point, where the details are unknown and cannot be speculated, the remaining points (1) and (2) both involve buying and selling behavior, which is certainly a definite confirmation of private ownership. The reason why it takes such measures. According to my personal observation, nothing comes out of the following points: (1) Striving for materials, (2) Striving for poor farmers, (3) Encouraging land production; Second, although the CCP's motive for taking such measures is not centered on solving the land problem, the result induces a tendency to decentralize land rights. One side disperses private land ownership. On one side, the number of people who own land private ownership naturally increases.</p>
<p>Speaking of dealing with the land problem in the communist region, the government has existing regulations to follow: One is the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in Various Provinces in the Bandit Suppression Area," which was previously implemented in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi; the other is the "Provisional Method for Granting Land by Population" of the Western Fujian Post-Disaster Committee. Solving the same problem with different methods is due to the fact that the system is suitable for the time and place. Western Fujian was originally a place with many You and few people. After a long period of war, there were even fewer people, and most of the landlords were killed and massacred at that time, so that there were many ownerless farmland afterwards, and there was a situation of "there is land but no one to cultivate." Therefore, it was decided to implement land granting according to the population, with less resistance and implying encouragement of birth and growth. From a historical lesson, granting land according to the population has little hope of success. The "Equal Field System" of the Northern Wei Dynasty and the "Handen System" of the Taika Reform in Japan are all failed precedents. Not only are there many difficulties during the reform, but the main difficulty is that after several years, farmland may not have increased much, while the population has increased year by year. This change in proportion will inevitably cause the original plan to be completely shaken again. The topography, population, and CCP's actions in Northern Jiangsu are different from those in Western Fujian, and granting land by population is not a good way, so no matter how granting land by population is implemented in Western Fujian, I don't want to advocate its implementation in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in Various Provinces in the Bandit Suppression Area," according to the main points of the regulations:</p>
<p>(1) All farmland and other real estate should be returned to the original owners in principle;</p>
<p>(2) Set the maximum amount of private farmland, and levy income tax on the land rent collected on the excess farmland at a progressive rate;</p>
<p>(3) Where land has been divided by the Communist Party, establish rural revival committees at all levels, sputum utensils are everywhere. Guide tenant farmers to cultivate and agricultural owners to form cooperatives, and transfer the public land and land rent managed by the committee to the cooperative for management;</p>
<p>(4) The national land whose boundaries have been destroyed may be re-marked after mutual recognition by the owners' meeting, and the scattered and fragmented farmland may be reorganized;</p>
<p>(5) For farmland and official wasteland whose ownership has not been determined, land is granted according to the population, and a quota is set, but the owners have priority;</p>
<p>(6) The rent amount is determined by the rural revival committee, and the owners shall not freely increase the rent or withdraw the land.</p>
<p>First, in the first point, we still recognize the existence of private land ownership, so we naturally agree with this principle. However, based on this principle to deal with the land problem in Northern Jiangsu, there are several points that must be discussed separately: (1) Except for the land confiscated by the CCP that is clearly the property of enemies and puppets and should be confiscated according to law, the rest should be returned to the original owners. It would be no problem to take back some of the land that the CCP has used as "rewards" and allocated. The problem is that the buyers have paid a considerable price to the CCP. Although the government can order that all these transactions are invalid, in order to be considerate of the buyers, my personal opinion is that buyers who do not exceed a certain amount and are indeed self-cultivated should be treated differently from those who buy more than a certain amount and do not use it all for self-cultivation. It is better to take back those who exceed a certain amount free of charge and return them to the original owners; for the rest of the self-cultivated countries, it is best to come up with a remedy. I certainly know that remedies are very difficult and few, but we shouldn't be afraid of difficulties. Even if the rescue is very small, it is better than no remedy at all. (2) When landlords sell land, no matter what the reason for the sale, as long as the sale is mediated and a contract is signed, this behavior is relatively fair, and we should recognize its legality. We sincerely advocate returning to the original owners in principle, but the above circumstances should be treated as exceptions. (3) If the sale was forced by the CCP to lower the price, although it is not sound from a legal point of view, the buyer is not necessarily designated by the CCP. If it is not recognized, it is clearly a disregard for the interests of third parties. Based on the teachings of our national father Sun Yat-sen and the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, we advocate that those who have such circumstances should also be recognized in principle, but in order to compensate the landlord's losses and fairness, the buyer should be ordered to make up the amount according to the fair price at that time.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, that is, setting the maximum amount of private land and levying income tax on the land rent of the excess land at a progressive rate. This is a policy of mild land reform implemented by means of high tax rates. Although we have no objection in principle, it must be clarified if it is applied to Northern Jiangsu. Originally, the so-called large landlords in Northern Jiangsu have different fertility levels, and the Xuhai area is different from the Tongru Huaiyang area. The soil in Tongru Huaiyang is more fertile (in fact, it can be said that the whole problem is water), and the number of landlords with more than 1,000 acres is very small. Usually, owning two or three hundred acres of land can be regarded as a wealthy person. The Xuhai area is different. The soil there is relatively barren. Owning thousands of acres of land is not considered rich. To be called a wealthy person, you must have tens of thousands of acres or even tens of thousands of acres. I know that the Qin and Ma families in Shuyang used to be like this. Therefore, when setting the maximum amount, if the maximum amount of private land is stipulated from 100 acres to 200 acres according to the land processing regulations of the three provinces, it can be applied to the Huaiyang notification and not be applied to Xuhai. Furthermore, judging from the actual situation during these disturbances, landlords who left their hometowns earlier sold less land, because they only sold some property for the living expenses of "living as a guest," which is very different from those who started to flee after the victory. Landlords who fled in the past year have experienced a long period of struggle. If they do not flee or cannot escape, they have to deal with reality. If they do not admit the fine, they are afraid of confiscation, so they have to sell a little and save a little. Such people account for the absolute majority of the refugees. Taking the counties of Tongru as an example, there are very few "refugees" who can retain more than one or two hundred acres by the time they flee. After this turmoil, it can also be said that after this lesson, many people's thinking has changed. They understand that the life of "clothes tax and food rent" is unreasonable, and they also know that the best way to curb the CCP's activities is to stabilize the lives of poor farmers. Under such circumstances, it is precisely the opportunity to promote our ideal land policy. In addition to setting the maximum amount of private land and levying income tax on the land rent of the excess land at a progressive rate, I don't know if the government can issue land bonds to purchase a part of those that are excessively excess. There are also those who advocate changing the progressive tax rate to thoroughly implement the two-five rent reduction, which is specially attached here for the reference of those who study this issue.</p>
<p>Regarding the third and fourth points, in addition to the establishment of rural and revival committees at all levels as administrative issues, the remaining issues, such as organizing rural utilization cooperatives and re-marking the boundaries of the destroyed national land, and reorganizing the scattered and fragmented farmland, are all issues related to the land itself. My friend Mr. Ge Luowu is a landlord who comes from a rural area and has struggled in the communist region for five years. During these five years, he has been studying the land problem. According to his view. The ideal of a rural cooperative is certainly good, but there are indeed problems with the talents who run the cooperative, as well as problems with the traditional habits and knowledge of farmers. Therefore, the results of the cooperative are often contrary to Hui Xiang. Therefore, he believes that only after twenty years, when the general public has made progress, can rural cooperation be done well. I propose to run a demonstration farm in each county, and the scale of this farm must be quite large. Doesn't the Xingzong have agricultural machinery? Aren't there technical guidance? It is very difficult to find a large piece of land on a normal day, but it is much more convenient at this time. In addition to official wasteland, public land, and ownerless land, it can also be requisitioned, purchased, straightened, and exchanged. If it is low, there is a machine to make it high; if it is high, there is a machine to make it low. The benefits of agricultural mechanization and scientific production, let the farmers see this demonstration farm, see Tongling with their own eyes, and touch it. Is our wish for the countryside just to revive it?</p>
<p>Regarding the fifth and sixth points, I feel that it is also a good way to protect the rights of tenants and prevent landlords from arbitrarily increasing rents. Nantung County has a total of about 3 million acres of cultivated land and a population of about 1.5 million. Assuming that each family has five members, each family has ten acres, and the estimated current value based on the output is about 1 million yuan. After deducting costs such as fertilization of about 500,000 yuan, the income is about 500,000 yuan. The average monthly living expenses for each person are 8,000 yuan. How can they survive? It all depends on sideline occupations. However, tenant farming requires an additional expense for rent. In other words, the income of tenant farmers is lower than that of self-cultivating farmers. Therefore, when setting the quota for granting land, the above-mentioned example of Nantong is of great reference value. In order to maintain the minimum living standard of tenant farmers, according to the situation in Nantong, each person must be granted at least two to three acres, and each family of five must have at least ten to fifteen acres. Nantong has an industrial base, and hand-weaving is even more common in villages, so the lives of Nantong farmers are generally good. The situation in Xuhai is not right. The soil is thin, the yield is small, and the sideline occupations are far less prosperous than in Tongru Huaiyang. When dealing with land in Northern Jiangsu, I think it is impossible to apply a fixed method rigidly to all counties.</p>
<p>To revive the countryside and improve the lives of farmers, it is not enough to rely on the system alone. Water conservancy, production technology, transportation, finance, etc., all have a very significant relationship and mutually influence each other. People think that as long as the system is reformed, the requirements for improving the lives of farmers can be met. Isn't that too simple? The discussion in this article is not beyond the scope of the system, and I am a layman on land issues. However, I am from Northern Jiangsu, so I naturally care about the core strength of Northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu has developed into a new situation, and reality cannot be avoided. Therefore, I do not hesitate to be protected by those who know, and rudely say what I want to say. As for correct opinions and methods, I hope experts will come up with them soon.</p>

<h3>The Suffering of Slaves</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>After watching "Spring Cold"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Experimental Theater Troupe's performance of "Spring Cold" this time is much more meaningful than its first performance of "The New Official Takes Office." "The New Official Takes Office" only wrote about a group of shameless hooligans bullying the common people by relying on the power of violent enemies; while "Spring Cold" wrote about the cunning and insidiousness of people's hearts; and how good people are tempted by the environment and become opportunistic; an inexperienced and pure woman cannot resist the drive of her own fantasies and the outside world taking honor as bait, causing her to have a nightmare and almost completely destroy herself.</p>
<p>"Spring Cold" deeply reveals the evil nature of human beings, making us shudder; deeply afraid of the rugged path of life, and the traps set by evil wolves and poisonous snakes in the darkness, wanting to devour us good and pure people, how terrible this is!</p>
<p>As long as we uncover the layer of story covering "Spring Cold," we can find more things inside. These things are endless, eternal, and also the ugly character often seen in today's society, and the conspiracies that may occur in any dark corner.</p>
<p>"Spring Cold," "Spring" is still "Cold"! My Lord! In which season will you give us warmth?</p>
<h3>The Music I Love</h3>
<p>— Li Qinghua</p>
<p>The young composer Mr. Zhang Dinghe composed many pieces during the Anti-Japanese War and has recently arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra and the Shanghai Municipal Music Association will hold a concert of his personal works this month. I am writing this article as an introduction.</p>
<p>I am a person of very stubborn preferences.</p>
<p>I like to have all-night conversations with friends on cold, lonely winter nights. I love to read short lyric poems. I like freehand brushwork paintings with two or three strokes. I love Chekhov's plays... Well, it's the same with music. I prefer the gentle and melancholy violin solos and the short songs that seem to sob and complain.</p>
<p>In fact, my relationship with music, even now, is like meeting a stranger. Although many music lovers have introduced me to it with great sincerity, I can only grasp a little of its appearance. When listening to music, although I sometimes pretend to be a connoisseur by closing my eyes and appreciating it, only a few fragments can occasionally melt into my heart.</p>
<p>I remember that the medium through which I became acquainted with music was He Luting's "The Cowherd's Flute." At that time, I was studying in a small town surrounded by green mountains. Outside the school gate were farmhouses and pastures. During our spare time, the school's surroundings were where we found spiritual rest. One day, the school held a concert—the only one in that secluded small town—and the only program I could accept was "The Cowherd's Flute." Because when this piece was played, I felt as if I were taking a walk on the fields outside the school. To this day, whenever I think of this piece, the scenery around the school appears before my eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is due to my living environment and the habits I have developed, but I don't particularly like large, rapid movements, but rather tranquil and beautiful small pieces. I like gentle violin pieces, and sometimes the first note can tightly grip my heartstrings. A few minutes of singing can make me daydream for a whole day. With music like this, I sometimes feel like I'm not listening to a performance, but listening to a young girl expressing her feelings, or a melancholy whisper. I don't like passionate love songs, but I often indulge in short songs full of tender feelings. I don't like loud and mournful elegies, but I yearn for that lingering taste.</p>
<p>Therefore, among many composers, I also prefer composers who are good at writing lyrical short songs. Among Chinese famous composers, Mr. Huang Zi's works are what I like. At the same time, the pieces of his talented student Mr. Zhang Dinghe are also what I prefer. Mr. Zhang is good at writing lyrical short songs, and the mood of his pieces is exactly the mood that I have always been accustomed to and preferred.</p>
<p>The first time I heard Mr. Zhang Dinghe's song was "Song of Exile," which was also around the time when "On the Songhua River" was widely popular. Perhaps it was because I was in exile in a foreign land at the time, but these two songs were almost always on my lips. In 1939, I sang them from Sichuan to Shaanxi, and in 1940, I sang them back from Shaanxi to Sichuan, "...Past events are like smoke, home mountains are like dreams, where is the way home? The same crescent moon, different moods, travelers are even more heartbroken..." These few sentences added much sorrow and bitterness to my daily life, but also gave me much remembrance and comfort.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Moruo's "The Flowers of Brotherhood" achieved unexpected success during its first performance in Chongqing. The rich plot in the script was certainly liked by the audience. However, Mr. Zhang Dinghe's several interlude songs can also be said to be a major factor contributing to the success of the performance. Those who watched the performance at the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall back then must have felt the same way. Those interludes fully expressed the emotions and atmosphere of the entire play. In China, there are already very few excellent writers of drama interludes, and Mr. Zhang is not only an excellent writer in this regard, but he has also written a large number of interludes for many plays. In addition to "The Flowers of Brotherhood," the interludes for "The Thunderstorm," "Ode to Righteousness," "Yue Fei," "Setting an Example," "Border Town Story," and many other plays were very popular in the rear areas. Even four- and five-year-old children loved to sing them. Mr. Zhang's contribution to the production of drama interludes is indelible. It is a pity that in recent years he has rarely composed for dramas. Perhaps I am not the only one who considers it a pity!</p>
<p>Well, there is no need for me to introduce him any further. Fortunately, Mr. Zhang's pieces are familiar to everyone in the rear areas, and there are many, many people who like his pieces. In Shanghai, Mr. Zhang may be very unfamiliar, but I believe that he will surely become a familiar composer to everyone in the future.</p>
<p>I am not a connoisseur, and I am even less accustomed to using any theories to measure everything. I like to talk about my personal preferences, and I especially like to stubbornly stick to my own preferences. On the occasion of Mr. Zhang's works being performed, I hope there will be a few people who, like me, prefer his pieces.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The Zhang Dinghe Works Concert is scheduled to be held at the Yiyuan on the evening of the 22nd of this month.)</p>
<h3>Popular Western Films: Introducing Three of the Most Beautiful Works</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>In recent years, Hollywood's Western historical films have been quite popular, so various companies are also trying their best to produce them in order to meet the public's expectations. For example, Republic Pictures actually makes Western films its main product. Their box-office power is no less than that of musicals, mythical palace dramas, etc. Because in every Western film, there is always an unparalleled hero and thrilling sword fights, gunfights, fistfights, and great war scenes, etc., which are what most children, teenagers, and young people admire and like the most. Therefore, Hollywood companies, because of the amazing box-office success of Western films, spare no expense to devote themselves to shooting them. Many Western films have been completed this year, and three of the most complete and beautiful are selected for introduction below:</p>
<p>(1) "San Antonio" starring Errol Flynn. His acting skills, agile horsemanship, skillful swordsmanship, and marksmanship are all well-known and have long been popular. The heroine is not the old partner Olivia de Havilland, but the new star Alexis Smith. The whole film is brilliantly colored and produced by Warner Bros.</p>
<p>(2) "Virginian" is adapted from the famous novel by novelist Owen Wister, starring Joel McCrea. We have been away from his films for a long time, and he has an excellent performance in this film. Others include Sonny Tufts, Brian Donlevy, etc. Barbara Britton from "The Spiritualist" plays the heroine. The stampede of cattle herds in the middle of the night and the galloping of outlaws after sunset are full of colorful shots in this film. It is a very valuable epic produced by Paramount Pictures.</p>
<p>(3) "Smoky" This is a Western story written by Will James twenty years ago, which depicts an untamed, stubborn horse named Smoky. Now, 20th Century Fox has made it into a beautiful and moving colorful Western film, starring Fred MacMurray and Anne Baxter.</p>
<h3>"House of Loyalty and Righteousness"</h3>
<p>— Yu Fu</p>
<p>The film "House of Loyalty and Righteousness," produced by the Second Factory of the Central Film Studio and directed by Wu Yonggang, was shown to the press and cultural circles on the morning of the 5th. Since then, the opinions and criticisms of the film in various newspapers and drama publications have been quite different. What is even more ridiculous is that a critic suggested adding a little story between Pu Zhendong and Hua Xinpei (played by Yan Su and Qin Yi). What is this so-called "story" referring to? Is it based on character or plot? If we add a "story" according to the American film style, that would be very interesting, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Any work must be criticized, otherwise, its artistic value cannot be evaluated and known.</p>
<p>Any artist must be able to withstand criticism; at the same time, the attitude of any critic must be benevolent, and the viewpoint must be correct. If a critic has a malicious attitude and a distorted viewpoint, then does he still want people to accept his criticism and his opinions? This is a very obvious thing, isn't it!</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Far East Market</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>After the end of the war, Hollywood film companies have been doing their best to restore the film industry to normal as quickly as possible. On the one hand, they are recruiting talents and rushing to make new films; on the other hand, they are paying attention to the overseas market and how to promote it. Therefore, in the past year, they have successively sent personnel to various overseas regions to investigate the changes in the film industry after the war in order to provide a reference for market promotion. In the Far East, the largest market for American films should be Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila. Therefore, large companies such as Paramount, MGM, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, etc., have all sent personnel to the East to investigate everything and compete for supremacy.</p>
<p>In the past year, the business competition of Hollywood film companies in the Far East has indeed been quite fierce. Taking Shanghai as an example, the films they have brought in are mostly masterpieces, such as those produced in 1944 and 1945 that have won the Academy Awards for Film Art and Sciences, which have also been brought in for public screenings one after another. As far as the Hollywood films we have seen, there are indeed many old films, but they are all better productions. And the screening period of films in Shanghai cinemas recently is longer than before the war. All the epics will be screened for several weeks. It is estimated that this trend will continue to be maintained in the coming year and will not change.</p>
<p>Not only in the Far East, but also in major cities around the world after the end of the war, the film industry has experienced high development. In this situation, Hollywood film companies must increase their production volume, because not only are there more cinemas in general cities than before the war, but also the audience is more enthusiastic than in the past. However, on the contrary, Hollywood film companies have produced fewer films in the past year than before the war, but the quality has been improved uniformly. No matter the cast, set design, photography, or editing, there has been progress in all aspects. This is of course also the only reason why a new film can be screened for several weeks in a row.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Beijing Opera Actors of "Tianchan"</h3>
<p>— Feng Chang</p>
<p>The Tianchan Stage went through several twists and turns before inviting the Beijing opera actor Hu Shaoan to the South. His opening play at Tianchan was "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and his name was even placed before Zhang Yunxi's in the introduction. This made the people of Shanghai dazzled and unable to guess what kind of person he was. So Hu Shaoan attracted the attention of the opera fans.</p>
<p>This attention was short-lived. After listening to his performances several times, the medicine sold in the gourd was exposed. Hu Shaoan was simply not as good as Wang Tiexia.</p>
<p>The elderly Beijing opera actors who came to Shanghai from the North were unlucky. Not counting those in the distant past, those in recent times such as Sha Shixin, Wang Wenyuan, Guo Chunyang, Xu Dongming, and Wang Tiexia were all without voices and were not welcomed by the people of Shanghai. As a result, they returned in disappointment.</p>
<p>Sha Shixin once missed a line on stage and bowed to the audience, which of course was a failure.</p>
<p>Wang Wenyuan once sang Old Commander Yang of Li Lingbei without carrying a tombstone, because Xun Huisheng was about to appear on stage and urged him to go down earlier, but the audience did not want a refund for his hasty ending.</p>
<p>Guo Chunyang took the lead for one day, but could not continue because his voice was ruined, so he gave Ji Yuliang a chance to replace him.</p>
<p>Xu Dongming's performance was slightly better than Guo Chunyang's, but he relied mostly on Zhou Weijun's Lu Wenlong's fighting in "The Eight Great Hammers."</p>
<p>Wang Tiexia, that was not long ago. His appearance and stage presence were good, and some people called him the "Western Style Elderly Actor," but his singing lacked charm, and the audience shook their heads at him, saying he was the most hopeless elderly actor.</p>
<p>This time Hu Shaoan came, and everyone expected him to be better than Wang Tiexia, but in fact it was the opposite. Hu Shaoan was not as good as Wang Tiexia. In terms of appearance, the two were in the same boat. In terms of voice, Wang Tiexia was not good, but at least it was consistent from beginning to end, while Hu Shaoan had two voices, high and low. When it was high, it could be compared to Song Baoluo, but it was only a high note at any time, and what followed it would definitely be terribly low, so low that even the people singing on the same stage could not hear it. Of course, the low voice accounted for more than 90 percent. In terms of martial arts, he was terribly loose. In terms of singing skills, no matter what you do, you will not be welcomed with this kind of voice. So I said that misfortune would soon befall Hu Shaoan.</p>
<h3>Fantasia and Bambi</h3>
<p>— Yin Huai</p>
<p>[This section is heavily damaged and the original Chinese characters are missing in many places. Therefore, I am unable to translate it accurately.]</p>

<h3>Love Story</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>Zhou Xueshi regarded his young maternal uncle as his best friend. His uncle often explained difficult parts of his textbooks and taught him various simple and interesting games. Xueshi's favorite game was having his uncle toss him into the air and then catch him in his palms. He never considered how dangerous this game was; he trusted those strong arms as deeply as he loved his uncle.</p>
<p>Returning home from school, Xueshi threw his satchel on a chair and loudly called out, "Uncle! Uncle!" He was ready to continue the fun from the night before.</p>
<p>Usually, he would easily receive a loud, hearty response, but today, he called three or four times, and still, there was no reply. It was rare for his uncle to go out at this hour. Feeling surprised, he walked into his uncle's bedroom.</p>
<p>Xueshi happened to see his uncle's back. He was sitting alone in a chair with a backrest, his right arm extended, his hand seemingly holding a small object, a jade piece of green and white, emitting a gleam. His uncle seemed to be gazing at it intently, not noticing the footsteps behind him. When his nephew came into view, he quickly clenched his right hand into a fist and put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Uncle, why didn't you answer me just now? Shall we go outside to play for a while?"</p>
<p>The two, one a young man of twenty-eight, the other a child of nine, went to the courtyard together. After suggesting some new games, Xueshi again clamored for his uncle to do the one where he threw him into the air.</p>
<p>Once, twice… Xueshi's body rose into the air, higher than his uncle's head, one time even reaching the height of a two-story building. They played happily, neither feeling tired.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something bright and exquisite fell from his uncle's pocket to the ground with a clatter. Lying on the cement floor was a jade goose of green and white, one of its wings broken.</p>
<p>His uncle's face immediately showed a look of panic and bewilderment. Only when Xueshi's body fell from mid-air did he remember to quickly reach out to catch him, nearly missing him. Xueshi thought to himself: this could be considered a dangerous game.</p>
<p>Before Xueshi could steady himself, he saw his uncle rush over, carefully picking up the broken object in his hands, his gaze filled with a desolate expression.</p>
<p>Shi Wenyu and Deng Guochu were close friends, both working at the same department store, and their bedrooms were also conveniently located next to each other, seeing each other day and night.</p>
<p>One day, when Deng Guochu got out of bed, he suddenly found a finger-sized jade goose in front of his door. Except for its wings, which were emerald green, the rest was as white as snow, delicate and lovely. Because he didn't know who had lost it, he temporarily kept it safe. Before he could leave his room, he saw Shi Wenyu rush in, anxiously and agitatedly, asking point-blank, "Old Deng, have you seen a jade goose? I dropped it."</p>
<p>"Haven't seen it. Hey, what's so special about a little jade goose? Just forget about it if you dropped it. Is it worth getting so worked up about?"</p>
<p>"If you say that, you must have seen my jade goose. Please return it to me. It's almost time for work."</p>
<p>"Did your sweetheart give it to you?"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"If you don't answer, you can forget about finding it."</p>
<p>"Old Deng, then I have to tell you: Yes. Please return it to me quickly."</p>
<p>"No way! You have to show me a picture of her."</p>
<p>"She didn't give me a picture."</p>
<p>"Don't lie. I'm telling you: I haven't seen any jade goose or any sparrow."</p>
<p>Shi Wenyu knew it was useless to say more. He took an envelope from the box under his bed, pulled out a photograph from it, and handed it to his colleague.</p>
<p>"Little Shi, you're quite the joker. Are these twin flowers new movie stars or your sisters?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense! The shorter one in the photo is my girlfriend, Yanling. The other one is her sister."</p>
<p>"Little Shi, you're really blessed with beauty. Hey, what's her sister's name?"</p>
<p>"Yanping."</p>
<p>"What a beautiful name. Hey… umm…"</p>
<p>If that photo wasn't four inches but eight inches, Shi Wenyu might have noticed that Old Deng was focusing all his attention on Yanping's face.</p>
<p>"Hey, Little Shi, do you know if Yanping is married?"</p>
<p>"Why do you ask? I'm not too sure. Judging by her age, she should be married, but I've never seen her associating with any man. She doesn't even have a boyfriend."</p>
<p>"Excellent!" Old Deng was a little carried away with himself. "Little Shi, introduce me to her. I'm willing to be her boyfriend."</p>
<p>Having spent a long time together, Shi Wenyu knew Old Deng's character, and he was indeed happy to help him succeed.</p>
<p>Deng Guochu remembered the date: September 6, 1934, the happiest page in his life history.</p>
<p>In the early autumn weather, the scenery of the park was particularly pleasant. Shi Wenyu and Deng Guochu arrived at Hongkou Park at dusk. The twin flowers had already arrived as agreed. Shi Wenyu smiled and greeted Yanling, and everyone gathered together.</p>
<p>"This is my colleague, Mr. Deng. This is Miss Jiang Yanping, and this is Miss Yanling." Little Shi introduced them one by one.</p>
<p>The two couples sat on the grass, exchanging every word from the bottom of their hearts. The evening glow on the horizon was distantly visible, and the chirping of autumn insects came and went intermittently. Deng Guochu only felt that everything before him was beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!</p>
<p>After that meeting, they often arranged garden outings, mostly with the four of them together. Old Deng had invited Yanping out alone, but when she arrived, she was always accompanied by her sister. He finally waited for one time when Yanping accepted his invitation alone. Old Deng thought it was an opportunity. He led her to a relatively quiet place and sat down to talk. He confessed many words of admiration to her, but she cleverly deflected the conversation.</p>
<p>In another solo meeting, Old Deng thought of a plan, but temporarily changed his mind and didn't dare to carry it out.</p>
<p>"Yanping, please close your eyes. I'll perform a magic trick for you."</p>
<p>He had originally planned to steal a kiss from her while he had the chance. His ears were burning, and his heart was beating very fast. He saw that she had already closed her eyes, but he still didn't dare to move. She opened her eyes again and asked in surprise, "What kind of magic trick are you doing? Have you done it yet?"</p>
<p>"Not yet! Quick! Please close your eyes. It's about to happen." His flustered expression was beyond words to describe.</p>
<p>He was prepared to disregard everything when suddenly, an old man walked by in the distance. Luckily, his anxiety gave rise to his quick wit, and he quickly picked a flower and brought it to her nostrils.</p>
<p>She smelled a fragrance and opened her eyes, seeing Old Deng covered in sweat, holding a white magnolia flower in his hand, extending his arm, the flower still touching her nostrils. "Oh, this is the magic trick."</p>
<p>Shi Wenyu told Old Deng that he was going to get engaged to Jiang Yanling in a few days and asked him to take care of all the trivial etiquette matters. While Old Deng was happy for his friend, he also thought about himself: he had repeatedly hinted at his love to Yanping, but she had never expressed anything. He was determined to break this torment.</p>
<p>After the engagement banquet, the guests dispersed, and the bustling hall suddenly became silent. Several in-laws were busy calling cars for the guests to return home. Shi Wenyu was persuaded to get drunk, and Yanping sat alone in a deserted corner as if touched by something. Deng Guochu took the opportunity to walk over.</p>
<p>"Yanping, please close your eyes. I have a very fun magic trick to perform for you."</p>
<p>She indeed closed her eyes. He no longer hesitated, borrowing the strength of a few glasses of wine, he summoned his courage and kissed her cheek, kissing her cherry lips.</p>
<p>With two loud smacks, Old Deng's face shared a slap on both sides. Yanping, who had struck the blow, had a steely expression, but although her lips moved, she couldn't speak for a long time. A few teardrops the size of red beans fell from her eyes.</p>
<p>Old Deng swallowed his anger and walked away.</p>
<p>After that, although they met, they didn't speak to each other, nor did they greet each other. After two whole months, once, Little Shi, Old Deng, and the Jiang sisters happened to meet again in the park. Yanling and Little Shi were talking happily, holding hands, and walked away, leaving Old Deng and Yanping, speechless to each other.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Old Deng couldn't help but speak:</p>
<p>"Yanping, it was my fault that day. I drank too much. I apologize to you now."</p>
<p>"Perhaps the fault lies with me. But my mistake isn't today. Two years ago, I knew I had made a big mistake…" She said here, bursting into tears.</p>
<p>"It's my fault, Yanping. Just forget about these small things. There's no need to be like this."</p>
<p>"You don't know the reason for my crying… Because I was tricked by someone! Hmm… Ooh…" Triggered by old sad memories, she cried even more like a spring, crying loudly.</p>
<p>"Who tricked you? I'll avenge you! Don't cry. Let's discuss it."</p>
<p>Old Deng listened to her crying and telling her story. Every word she said was a sharp blade, and his heart was pierced with wounds and shattered. He was so angry that he couldn't speak.</p>
<p>"So, Old Deng, the moment I see a man, I hate him and I'm afraid. The old wounds have made me lose the courage to live. He has hurt me so much. It's simply indescribable. He also showed me kindness at first. He made a wish and vowed to love me. When I lost my virginity to him… Why doesn't God make this kind of person die early? As long as he lives in the world, my pain and an invisible shackle can never be removed. I heard that he's already living with a wealthy young lady. I often worry about that nameless lady. Will her fate sooner or later become the same as mine?"</p>
<p>Old Deng still couldn't speak. Before parting, he asked her for a commemorative object. Yanping generously took off a fresh, crystal-clear jade goose from her neck and handed it to him, telling him that it was an item left by her late mother. It was originally a pair, and the sisters each took one. She was preparing to leave Shanghai and go to a convent in another city to spend the rest of her life. This jade goose, seeing the object is like seeing the person, left as a memory of friendship.</p>
<p>Deng Guochu held the broken jade goose, recalling the past. Two years had passed, and everything was different. Yanling already had children, while Yanping's whereabouts were unknown, at the ends of the earth, where she was living?</p>
<p>"Uncle, why are you crying?"</p>
<p>Hearing the innocent child's voice, he had to stop his tears, carefully wrapped the broken goose in a handkerchief, and put it in his arms, continuously calling out softly:</p>
<p>"Yanping, Yanping, I wish you well! I wish you well!"</p>
<h3>First Offense (Selection of World Famous Paintings)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Lu</p>
<p>By Lady Stanley. Collection of the Tate Gallery, London.</p>
<p>Lady Stanley was an artist herself, and her husband was a great explorer.</p>
<p>Her artistic life started early, because she was already learning to paint before she started learning to read and write. She received excellent training. She first studied with Bowtell and Sir Leighton, and later in Paris with Henner, where she spent three winters.</p>
<p>Her works on street beggars, ocean goddesses, and mountain nymphs are a major feature of London art exhibitions. At the same time, her black and white drawings are also very popular in the magazine world.</p>
<p>"First Offense" is a deeply portrayed work. It was exhibited at the New Gallery in 1896 and purchased by Sir Tate, who also asked Lady Stanley to paint more drafts of ragged children.</p>
<h3>Setting Sun</h3>
<p>— Mi Lixing</p>
<p>Dedicated to Mozart's "Poem":</p>
<p>Divertismento 17eme en Re Mineur</p>
<p>(Divertismento No. 17 in D Minor)</p>
<p>For a century and a half, among the famous works that Franz Schubert left to us later generations, besides the most approachable Ave Maria (Hail Mary) and the Symphonie Lnachevee (Symphony No. 8 "B Minor" Unfinished Symphony), which he himself thought he "no longer had the creative power to continue writing", how many later generations of "music lovers" would understand the two "C" major masterpieces that he carefully structured, which were a thousand times better than these two works, yet were not noticed or admired by the general public? However, in the process of a century and a half, our Schubert has undoubtedly become, from the remaining sounds of these two "C" major masterpieces, since Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, the only great thinker and creative composer who combines H, M, and B.</p>
<p>In the last three cold summers of his life, which was full of hardship and poverty, he repeatedly savored this chapter of Mozart's "Poem" (Divertismento Poetique) due to his infatuation, and the "inspiration" he gained finally led to the completion of these two "C" major masterpieces in the early autumn of 1824: (A) Quintteto III eme en do Majeur (Quintteto No. 3 in C Major) (B) Sympi.onie 5 eme, en do Majeur (Symphony No. 5 in C Major). The former describes his own admiration for Mozart, while the latter reveals a hint of suspicion that the "Poem" of Mozart did not come from his own hand but from the divine power of God. The total revelation of the two "C"s; our bold Schubert seems to be questioning God straightforwardly: "God! Why did you create Mozart and burden me, a younger generation, to exhaust my efforts and even my entire life!"</p>
<p>However, this has added two "C" major masterpieces to the brilliant history of human art. Is it a gift from heaven? Or the "Poem" of Mozart?</p>
<p>Divertismento No. 17 in D Minor, i.e. Divertismento Poetique, was written by Mozart in 1787 in Rientz, a small village near Vienna. The whole piece is divided into four sections:</p>
<p>Ier Mouvement Allegro</p>
<p>IIeme Mouvement Adagio</p>
<p>IIIeme Mouvement Minueto</p>
<p>VIIeme Mouvement Presto</p>
<p>The main theme is completely written to commemorate his deceased teacher Joseph Haydn. From beginning to end, every note fully expresses his childlike thoughts, and every moment shows his reverie of remembering the dead or the possibility of the soul returning. But only after the third section does he begin to realize the inherent comfort of the afterlife, that the body may die, but the spirit does not perish. Finally, in the last section, he annotates the following "philosophical words," adding to the sigh of life's uncertainty, and actively uses "Presto" to pour out everything that others in the past and future have failed to write in one breath. This is today's "Setting Sun Poem."</p>
<p>"In the same sunset as today, his kind face, with that patient color, the past events of music, all seem to be right before my eyes, but today, revisiting the old place, the woods are still the same, but that predecessor, who can only be imagined, sleeps forever in the ground, the green moss never ends, the brevity of life, standing in the setting sun, wanting to speak but having no words, no words, no words, no words in today's setting sun."</p>
<p>April 1787, Mozart in Rientz</p>
<p>Author's postscript: This manuscript was written in French and published in Paris, International Bitter Music Quarterly, May edition, 1939. The original no longer exists. Now, based on the reference materials used in those years, I rewrite the old work. The following were referenced: (1) Schubert's two "C" major masterpieces: Richard Strauss, original work, German Academy, 1912 French translation, (2) Mozart's "Poem" Treatise; Wagner, original work, German Academy, 1912 German translation.</p>

<h3>Recommending "Spring Chill"</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The performance of spoken drama has never been interrupted since the victory. There is at least one troupe performing every day, sometimes even two or three. Everyone has seen the efforts of drama workers, but the box office record is far from comparable to the victory. Therefore, many troupes are either losing money or dare not try lightly.</p>
<p>A closer analysis of this sluggish phenomenon is probably caused by the large influx of foreign films and the tastes of Shanghainese. It is not a matter of ticket prices being high or low, nor is it entirely due to the general public's preference for low-level tastes. If this analysis is correct, the future of Shanghai's theatrical movement is worth worrying about.</p>
<p>It is said that after the victory, only two plays made money, one was "Promotion Chart" and the other was "A Teacher for All Ages." All other performances lost money, only in varying amounts. The quality of a play cannot be measured by the number of seats sold, especially in China. Even many foreign films are no exception. A troupe is different from a store. At least at present, most troupes still value artistry over business, so making money is not necessarily the goal of a troupe. However, precisely because a troupe is not a profit-making organization, its normal and reasonable expenses must be resolved, otherwise, it will not be able to continue working. If it loses money again, it will be even more unthinkable.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, many troupes have embarked on the road of business, which is not surprising: this is naturally not a reasonable approach. Friends in the drama circle should actively discuss and seek a proper path, because as time goes by, we can easily imagine its future appearance.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, "Spring Chill," written by Song Zhi and directed by Hong Shen, was staged at the Lyceum Theatre. As one of the audience members, I am willing to recommend this performance to my readers. I dare to guarantee that this is one of the few good performances in Shanghai after the victory. If you truly appreciate drama, you should not miss this performance. The playwright's humor, the director's rigor, and the actors' cultivation can all be said to be first-class.</p>
<p>Drama workers should know to struggle for survival, struggle to continue their work, but they need our audience's cooperation even more, to give them courage and give them encouragement. If we all go to see it, we can achieve the above goals. After watching it, what the criticism is like is another matter.</p>
<p>The most heartbreaking thing in the world is being ignored and neglected. Can we treat this group of hard-working and arduous drama workers with high ideals and enthusiasm in such a cruel way?</p>
<p>Therefore, here, I am more willing to recommend "Spring Chill."</p>
<h3>The Story of the Briefcase</h3>
<p>— Rumormonger</p>
<p>I hope this is just a preposterous and unsubstantiated tale! Yesterday, I heard the following news from a friend:</p>
<p>In the 1950s, in the capital city of Country C in Continent A, there was a Major General Counselor in a certain government office. Every morning, he would go to the office from his residence carrying a deflated, large leather briefcase. Every evening, he would go home from the office carrying a plump, large leather briefcase. Naturally, the briefcase was still the same one, but it had become plump.</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days... several days passed, and it seemed that there was no exception. The military police comrade on duty at the gate saw it every day. At first, they thought it was unfinished official business being taken home, but as the days went by, they always saw the deflated briefcase being carried in and the plump briefcase being carried out. They only saw things being taken out and never saw anything being taken back. They couldn't help but feel suspicious. For the sake of their duty, they finally launched an attack one evening after work.</p>
<p>As usual, the Counselor was carrying the plump briefcase out.</p>
<p>"Attention! Salute!" The military police comrades didn't dare to neglect the formalities.</p>
<p>The Counselor expertly raised his right hand, returned the salute, and just as his foot was about to step on the first step at the entrance, one of the two gate military police officers respectfully called out:</p>
<p>"Reporting, Counselor! We are ordered to inspect the Counselor's briefcase!"</p>
<p>This was unacceptable. How could a Major General Counselor's official briefcase be easily inspected by others? In order to maintain due dignity, he refused their request on the grounds of "classified information." However, the military police comrade refused to easily let it go and further reported the reason for "being ordered to inspect," leaving him with no way to refuse. What to do? Decades of struggle, the family's tradition of integrity passed down through generations, and his lifelong reputation of integrity and self-restraint... all would be ruined this time... His heart turned into a termite nest, with hundreds of termites wriggling inside, but he still maintained his composure and dignity on the surface. A flash of inspiration finally gave him a solution.</p>
<p>"Inspection is allowed, but it must be opened in front of the Director. Otherwise, no."</p>
<p>So, one military police officer followed our Counselor to the Director's office. Fortunately, the Director had not yet left, and there was hope for resolving their dispute.</p>
<p>After entering the Director's office, the Counselor performed the customary greetings and salutations. Before the military police officer could report, the Counselor preemptively spoke:</p>
<p>"Reporting, Director! He wants to inspect my briefcase because my family is large and ten thousand yuan a month is not enough to cover expenses, so every day I bring home the leftover rice from the government's meals..."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, his eyes suddenly turned sour, and tears welled up. His throat seemed to be choked with a wad of cotton, and he began to sob, unable to continue. He forgot his position as a Major General Counselor and instead sobbed like a child who had been bullied and returned to his mother's embrace to complain. The Director couldn't figure out what was going on and thought he had developed a nervous disorder. After the military police comrade's explanation, the Director took the briefcase from his hand, opened it, and saw that the white paper package was filled with white and soft cold rice grains. The clever Director immediately understood everything, waved his hand, and told the military police officer to leave...</p>
<p>The next day, our Counselor received a notice from the accounting office, which essentially stated that, upon the Director's order, because Counselor × was diligent in his work and of high moral character, a special subsidy of 50,000 legal tender would be issued each month, and he should come to the office to collect this month's subsidy.</p>
<p>The story ends here with a happy ending. Recently, it was heard that the C Country authorities, in view of the fact that the treatment of the national comrades was too meager, had doubled the salaries of all ranks from July of this year. A general's monthly income is 250,000 yuan, which is comparable to the 50-yuan base salary of workers in Shanghai, so he has nothing to be ashamed of. As for the recent situation of that Counselor, I haven't heard anything. I wish his family a life of plenty!</p>
<h3>Five-Minute Romance</h3>
<p>— Cheng Lian</p>
<p>Dusk, I walk on the side of Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>A U.S.N. sailor wanders not far ahead.</p>
<p>A rich fragrance blows in the breeze. A girl in strange clothes, twisting her waist and taking quick steps, catches up from behind. She walks so uncomfortably, obviously because her high heels are too high.</p>
<p>"Hello," she approaches him and greets him softly.</p>
<p>He glances at her and continues walking.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" She leans closer to him.</p>
<p>He still looks at her and gives her a smile.</p>
<p>She returns him a flirtatious wink.</p>
<p>She opens her glass purse, takes out two cigarettes, and hands one to him.</p>
<p>He takes out a lighter from his pocket.</p>
<p>"Thank you," he takes her cigarette.</p>
<p>"Thank you," he lights her cigarette.</p>
<p>They smoke cigarettes. Her hand is linked with his, and his hand is also linked with hers.</p>
<p>Their words are even lower, whispering softly.</p>
<p>She points to the billboard of the movie theater beside the road, saying something to him, and he nods.</p>
<p>Layers of night cover them, and neon lights flash dazzlingly.</p>
<p>She leans even closer to him, disappearing into the endless darkness.</p>
<p>Only five minutes! Their love has already matured, or perhaps it will have a deeper relationship!</p>
<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<p>— Kun Ming</p>
<p>Passenger: It's so hot today, it's really unbearable.</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: It should be hot.</p>
<p>Passenger: What kind of talk is that?</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: It rained so much in the past two months that the rice in the fields was ruined. If it wasn't hot, wouldn't it be even worse?</p>
<p>Passenger: But it's still uncomfortable when it's hot.</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: The farmers are happy! Because the fields can slowly recover.</p>
<p>Passenger: What does that have to do with me?</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: Oh! Sir, you have to eat!</p>
<p>Passenger: Eat? Hmph! I have money, am I afraid I can't buy rice?</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: But money can't be eaten.</p>
<p>Passenger: Stop talking nonsense, pull faster, pull faster, I have things to do.</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: Alas! It's scorching above and burning below, sir, you really don't know how hard it is for us rickshaw pullers!</p>
<p>Passenger: Then who told you to pull a rickshaw?</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: Hey! Who told you to ride in a rickshaw? If there were no passengers, we wouldn't pull rickshaws.</p>
<p>Passenger: Damn it, I ran into a talkative guy like you. Now the authorities want to eliminate rickshaws. In three years, let's see what you'll do!</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller: Three years later, sir, will you be able to ride in a car in three years?</p>
<h3>Within School Circles</h3>
<p>If a group of girls are standing on the escalator chatting, then when a boy walks up, he will definitely politely step aside. Conversely, if a group of boys are standing in one place, the same thing happens when a girl walks past. This can be said to be a commonly recognized theorem among students.</p>
<p>If a high school has both general and business departments, then generally speaking, the two are bound to be in opposition. Often, if the business department organizes something, the general department will never participate. Furthermore, if the business department organizes some kind of club, the general department will try to sabotage it. Everywhere, the non-cooperation between the general and business departments can be seen. Currently, this is the case in almost all schools in Shanghai that have business departments. It is extremely rare for the general and business departments to truly be able to cooperate harmoniously.</p>
<h3>Last Year Today</h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>Last year today, in Shanghai, around six in the morning, I received a call from a friend who said:</p>
<p>"Tokyo Radio broadcast last night that Japan has surrendered unconditionally to the United Nations."</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" I asked with a tone of surprise, excitement, and half-doubt.</p>
<p>Then I received more than a dozen calls. Relatives and friends all told me about this matter. Some only said, "Do you know what happened last night?" I quickly replied, "I know, I know." Everyone understood each other tacitly, afraid of being "listened to" by the Japanese secret police stationed in the telephone bureau.</p>
<p>Citizens couldn't hide their excitement, forgetting that this might be a rumor. The entire city resounded with firecrackers all day, and there were two peculiar new activities: ball games—a portion of citizens surrounded Japanese residents, snatched their hats, and tossed them back and forth like basketballs; target practice—throwing watermelon rinds at passing Japanese military trucks.</p>
<p>In the evening, the "air defense posture" under the enemy puppet regime was dissolved invisibly. Citizens replaced their light bulbs with high-wattage ones, and the air raid shelter lamps were thrown aside. Shanghai once again became a city that never sleeps.</p>
<p>A majestic song resounded again on the radio, "Arise, you who refuse to be slaves!"</p>
<h3>Smoking</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Father: Little devil!</p>
<p>Son: What? Are you swearing at me!</p>
<p>Father: Why are you smoking?</p>
<p>Son: I'm patriotic!</p>
<p>Father: Smoking is patriotic? Who told you that?</p>
<p>Son: Didn't the newspaper say that foreign cigarettes are being dumped, and no one is smoking domestic cigarettes? If no one smokes domestic cigarettes, factories will close down, and won't China's future be greatly affected by industrial bankruptcy? So I'm trying hard to learn to smoke. Look! Isn't this pack of cigarettes domestic?</p>
<p>Father: Hmm!</p>
