<h3>雙方接受調人意見　和平商談重開有望　政府政協代表晉謁主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕據聞：和談情况五日已漸具體化，國共雙方均能接受調人新方案重開和談，惟周恩來五日與民盟人士見面後，雖已就軍事，政治各點提出詳盡說明，然終嫌過於廣泛，而政府方面則希望問題簡化，以較重要及急待解決者居先解決，至民盟等所提意見中，對國大問題雖已提及，恐於緩期一事，亦未作肯定式建議，政府代表對國大表示決不延期。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕民盟，靑年黨及社會賢達代表，對和談所定新方案，五日已獲國共雙方同意，據聞；內容祇着重商談重開，至會議形式則尙待最後決定。若干人士認爲：六日即將舉行綜合會議說，未免言之過早。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕張君勱五日晨訪邵力子，旋訪司使，再申調人意見，並於十時出席在交通銀行舉行之會議，周恩來亦應邀出席，報吿六月休戰以來與美方及政府接觸經過以及共黨對和談程序上之意見，對整軍駐地間題羅列要點至爲詳盡。下午四時政府代表邵力子·王世杰·張厲生·雷震集會於吳鐵城寓邸，同時，繆嘉銘·莫德惠·張君勱·梁漱溟·張申府·章伯鈞·羅隆基亦往參加，由張君勱等報吿共方意見，並提出更較具體之意見，旋政府政協代表於五時往謁主席，報告一切，主席瀉即表示，政府誠意求和平，重開和談自屬同意，至和談程序與形式，則尚待研究。據悉：政府代表將於六日下午三時集會，再行討論，並於五時與民盟諸人士見面，報吿政府態度，綜此以觀，和談得開似已有望，但如何啓其端，尙難確定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕共黨王炳南五日上午訪司使，傅涇波於十一時許訪宋子文，下午一時司使偕傳涇波赴彭學沛宴，並有邵力子。張萬生·吳鐵城等作陪，三時始返。</p>

<h3>徐傳霖縱論時局　贊同責任內閣制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民主社會黨秘書長徐傅霖氏五日吿記者稱：彼係一日返滬，故於京中和談現况，不甚明瞭，外傳張君勱氏曾提出新的折衷方案之具體內容，因亦無從知悉。惟據目前報載各項情形觀察，則前途困難實多。前在京時即曾聞國大開會儀式後有休會若干日再從長計議之說，然依法國大旣經開會，則是否休會，權在國大本身。實則以政府望治之切，爲永久之和平統一計，即使展期開會，亦決不損及政府之威信。深望政府開誠布公，從遠處大處着想，總以容忍爲上。徐氏認爲改組國府，事實上困難亦正不少。而將來聯合政府成立之後，恐亦不免以頗多之時間，耗於爭辯之中，行政效率，未必即有若何極大之進步；所貴於聯合政府者，以其爲達到眞正民主政府前之一必要的過渡階段耳。關於憲草問題，徐氏謂彼本人參加制憲，亦已不止一次，日前在京曾晤及現正整理憲草之孫科及王　惠二氏，彼以爲各方對憲草之看法雖亦見仁見智，各有不同，但大體上當不致有嚴重問題，彼本人則以爲責任內閣制比較適宜。</p>
<h3>政例會通過中美友好商約</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕中美商的經五日行政院例會通過，即送呈國防最高會議核定，交立法院審議通過後。再由國府批准。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕立院九日開會，將討論中美新商的，並聞中美雙方將同時予以批准。</p>
<h3>開放海口條款　必須妥爲運用</h3>
<p>滬輪船業提出意見</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據輪船業公會秘書長李雲良氏表示，中美商約航海部份第廿二條規定，對於締約國船舶徵收之各種捐稅及費用，不得高於本國船舶，第二十三條第二項規定，凡由本國船舶輸出及輸入物品所給予之獎勵金，退稅以及其他任何名目之優惠待遇，亦應同樣給予締的國之船舶，此兩點的束，本國對於國籍商船及國際貿易之獎助，極不利於產業及航業幼穉之國家，希望在實施上加以警惕，以免招致損害之後果。</p>
<p>第二十一條第一項規定，締的雙方領土間，應有通商航海之自由，此項自由，當指國際航行而言，締約國船舶所能停泊之港口，應以本國開放國際航行之沿海通商口岸而言，如天津·靑島，上海及廣州等埠，此項通商口岸開放與否，其權操在本國政府。</p>
<p>第二十四條規定，締的國船舶得在本國對外國商務及航業開放之任何口岸地方，或領水以內，起卸一部份載貨，再將餘貨運往其他口岸，此種通融辦法，亦極易發生流弊。</p>
<p>同條第二項，關於內河航行及沿海貿易之假定的最優惠國條款，實屬畫蛇添足。蓋中美平等新的，已明白規定，美國放棄在華內河航行及沿海貿易之權利，商的係根據前項蓋本條約所補充之協定，惟有人以爲商約締訂後，我國不扳保全內河及沿海航行權，實爲一種誤會，如果政府開放內河及沿海航行，我航業界必斷然加以反對，而國際航行自十六世紀確立公海制度，及商業革命打破閉關自守之舊規以後，則爲各國所通行，除因軍事上之理由外，鮮有禁阻者，我國現當善後救濟及復興建設之時，需要美國運來大批機器物資，而桐油·生絲·茶業猪鬃·藥材等土產，亦亟待推廣輸出，深望中美商約實施後，對於兩國經濟合作格外加强，而美國能以其剩餘之船舶及造船設備，以優惠之條件，轉讓我國，以助我建立新式商船艦隊，此由全國航業界所迫切企望於美國朝野者。</p>

<h3>中英商約草案中港九等問題　正在審查不久即可簽訂</h3>

<h3>由中共的荒謬聲明說起</h3>
<p>中共代表團於本月四日發表荒謬聲明，要點凡二：（一）十一月十二日召開國大，爲國民黨政府違背政協决議的片面行爲，政協決議乃臨時憲章，故一切違反的行爲是毁法行爲，中共抗議參加。（二）「以政協憲草審議會擬定之憲草爲藍本」云云，無論在法律上與事實上，都是沒有根據的。我們覺得非常詫異：中共今天居然大談其「法律」，居然要求在「法律上」須有根據，更居然指賓國民政府本月十二日召開國大爲「毁法行爲」。這眞所謂異想天開的法律論了！</p>
<p>針對中共這一荒謬的聲明，政府昨天已有所駁覆，大意說：國大能否如期召開，取决於參加代表是否達到法定人數，而中共之參加與吾，則純爲政治上之問題，故如報到代表足够法定人數即可舉行，中共即使拒絕參加，亦並不能妨碍國大之如期召開。政府所講的「法」，與中共所捧出來的「法」，究竟那一方面合理，明眼人當可不言而喩。</p>
<p>第一，我們必須提醒朝野上下的：今天中國只有一個合法政府，那就是國民政府，它是爲中外所公認的；今天中國也只有經過國民政府法定立法機關所通過的法律，纔是國民所應遵守的法律。無論國民政府最近將如何改組，而在憲法未頒布，憲政未實施以前，中國固猶在三民主義的革命建國過程中的訓政時期。今天國府之所以要召開國大，就是想按步就班的由訓政而進於憲政。可是在這過渡時期，如大家先不守法，尤其爲了遷就現實政治而可以踰越法律，那麼在違法過程中產生的憲法誰還尊重？故中共此刻挖空心思，想掮出「毀法」兩個字來嚇唬政府，愚弄人民，動搖他們如期召開國大的决心。其實，不談法則已，要說到法律，則中共之所爲，固無一而非違法。中共的「毁法」論，無異揭發了它自己的罪狀！延安的「邊區政府」，有什麼法律根據？「民主聯軍」的稱號，有什麼法律根據？禁用法幣，濫發抗幣和邊鈔，又有什麼法律根據？「解放區」裏的征捐勒稅，更有什麼法律根據？中共自己種種毀法亂紀的行爲，罄竹難書，却一概抹煞，而反誣指我國唯一合法政府下令召開國大制憲爲「毀法」，眞是今古奇談！</p>
<p>第二，政治協商會議的性質，我們在當時就指出這僅僅是一種解決黨派糾紛的政治措施，是一種各方交換意見相互取得共同結論的政治性的會議，而絕不能認爲國家立法的機構，更不是代表民意的機構。故各方面彼此尊重政協决議，乃是各方面的政治責任，而絕非法律上的問題。換言之，政協的決議，倘未經過國家立法機構通過的，程序又未經過人民代表的批准手續，則根本談不到「法律」，更何論謬稱之爲「臨時憲章」？旣無臨時憲章之可言，則本月十二日國大的召開，又何從硬加以「毁法行爲」的帽子？我們允須說明的，在人民看來，政協决議不過等於各黨派間政治休戰的君子協定，而與全國人民並不相千。何况政協決議之重心，原不外改組國府，召開國大，並以政協建議修正意見爲根據而制定憲法而已。今天政府就在努力實行這幾點。政府首先表示願即改組國府委員會，决又表示國大制憲將以政協憲草審議會擬定之憲草爲藍本，可見政府實是誠心遵守政協決議，以盡其政治上的責任。而中共方面，旣不以改組國府委員會爲滿足，又不開示國大代表名單，甚且公然聲明拒絕參加國大，復從而鼓動其他黨派爲其應聲，以企圖阻撓國大制憲的工作，則違反政協決議的，就是中共自己了！</p>
<p>總之，我們站在人民立塲，要大聲疾呼，請各黨各派人士今天睜眼看看日本，再回頭看看自己，千萬警覺，切不可再來故閙蹩扭，貽害國家大局，尤其不可誤墜於中共斷送國家和平統一的陷阱中！今天我們只有一個要求，就是改組國府委員會，和如期召開國大制定憲法。惟有如此，國家才可眞正和平統一。政府必須如此負責的幹去，各黨各派如有國家觀念者，亦必須如此合作，纔對得起人民。其有動搖猶豫，因循觀望，以拖延此不死不活的局面，或甚而至於破壞阻擾，使國家更陷於混亂之境的，都是國家民族千秋萬世的罪人！</p>

<h3>四強外長討論對義和約　美蘇發生劇烈爭執　將聆取義南兩國代表意見</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約五日電〕四外長定於今日下午八時半繼續開會。（上海時間六日上午四時半）四外長昨在開會前，曾獲義政府對和的若干部份所提之抗議書，其中指出賠款額之過鉅，劃界之不當，並謂該的不能與大西洋憲章之原則相符合。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社約五日電」四國外長昨日午後在亞斯多麗亞旅　客廳中開會，討論對義和約中爭執各點。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫時時與其他外長發生爭議，故討論三小時後鮮有具體結果。首先討論者爲義大利與南斯拉夫邊界問題，義南兩國均有發言之權，但何國應先發言，則爲問題所在。經周密討論後，決定先由義代表發表意見，然後由南國代表陳述意見。</p>
<p>次及奧義邊界之條款，莫洛托夫拒絕以兩國關於蒂羅爾省人民地位所成立之協定插入和的。貝爾納斯謂四外長無理由放棄巴黎和會經三分之二多數採納之決定，四強對於奧養條約之簽訂，出力殊多，應正式加以批准，方爲正辦。但莫洛托夫堅決拒絕，謂蒂羅爾省人民不滿此項協定，比一問題結果懸而未決。</p>
<p>復次討論和的中增添之條文，即規定義大利割議領土內之人民，應保有人權與各項根本自由權。此條曾經和會以三分之二多數通過。莫洛托夫稱，此係之插入並無必要，因勝利之盟國不必懷疑其有剝奪人類自由之意向，况此條之列入與以前各條相抵觸。貝爾納斯與莫洛托夫反復辯論，未有任何接近之協議。該問題亦暫時擱置。</p>
<p>最後討論義大利對希南兩國之賠款，巴黎和會決議每國各獲一億美元，莫洛托夫認爲此數不公，因特里埃斯特港之喪失，對於南斯拉夫所望於和會之權利已大爲減低，故南國與希臘之賠償，應照二比一推算。英外相貝文猛烈加以反對，謂將永不接受此項計劃，因依渠所見，希臘已受不公待遇。貝爾納斯指出南國獲得之割地，包括煤礦與工業設備在內，價値達一億九千五百萬美元，是即臍款之一部份。但莫氏表示不服，謂此項設備位在南期拉夫領土以內，焉能充爲賠款。莫氏並乘機說明和的對南斯拉夫待遇之苛刻，四外長實不宜　　國　喪過甚云。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約四日電〕外長會議於今日下午召開前，貝爾納斯分別與貝　，莫洛托夫及法外次繆維爾會談。貝爾納斯曾吿貝文謂，巴勒斯坦問題之處理，已由杜魯門總統移交與彼。今日兩人晤談時，並曾涉及德境英美兩區合併之事。貝氏稱，在外長會議討論和的問題以外之時間，渠將與其討論巴勒斯坦問題。</p>
<h3>託管問題展開舌戰　英蘇兩集團對立　南非總理要求全併西南非　湯姆斯述英帝國殖民政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖五日電〕托管委會本日下午八時繼續開會，印度代表辛格當首先發言，或當提出新決議案，主張由聯合國治理委治地，而不由各個國家治理。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日專電〕聯合國託管委會今日開始工作，在未向大會提出採取行動之適常建議及可能成立託管理事會以前，該委會先審査各負責治理各列强所提出之有關非自治領土之協議及報吿。南非總理史末資今向該委會正式要求歸併其受委管理之西南非土地，史末資否認烏克蘭之指責謂南非之要求突如其來，渠於去年舊金山會議及本年初在備敦即已宣布其願望矣，且事前預料蘇聯將予反對，伹氏對蘇聯之反對，不以爲意，謂此事會與酊南非人民商議。史末資叫吿蘇聯，謂有若干土地，並未有類此之商議，而即被歸併者。後此英帝國又一代表即殖民次長湯姆斯發言，反攻蘇聯之指責，痛斥蘇聯擱置英國託管協議草案，並阻止託管理事會早日成立。「託管戰鬥」正在開展，其陣容爲不列顚聯合國對蘇聯。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖四日電〕英殖民部次官湯姆斯，在託管委會中稱，莫洛托夫前謂聯合國機構成立已將兩年，而委治國竟未採取任何步驟以建立託管理事會，此語使英代表團深感驚異，不知其情報不靈，何以竟至於此。就英國言，每一步驟均已採取，首先發表托管條件者亦爲英國。塲氏網解釋英國之殖民政策稱，英國所草之托管制度，乃近代英政策之產物，英國各殖民地內之基本自由，較其他許多主權國，猶有更適當之保障。有謂殖民地乃英國之財源，其實英國已計劃於今後十年內，將英國納稅人所納之一萬萬二千萬鎊用之於各殖民地，英國始終認爲自治乃殖民地最後之命運，故當盡力訓練殖民地人民，向自治之途發展云。　〔本報特派員紐約四日</p>
<h3>本報特派員在紐約廣播</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員紐約四日電〕聯合國電合與WLIB電台，邀本報特派員毛樹淸君發表廣播演說。毛君在聯會國電用中文廣播，題爲「聯大之中國新聞記者」。今日下午，又在WLIB電台用英文廣播，討論中國共產黨問題，力言「此項問題爲中國內政問題，僅能由中國自己解決之」。</p>

<h3>安理會採納波蘭建議　西班牙案剔出議程　俾直接由聯大會辯論</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約四日電〕安理會今日一致通過波蘭之決議，將西班牙問題自安理會之議程上撒除，俾直接由全體大會辯論，波代表闌琪謂，關於此上問題之記錄，堆積已有不少，此等文件均將交全體大會處置，此舉並不影響安理會之權利與特權，任何理事仍有提出該問題之自由。波蘭此項動議，美國附議，並主張理事會應硏究其他問題應吾同樣辦理，此顯係間接指示久懸未決之蘇聯與伊朗問題。</p>

<p>〔太報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：聯合國政治委會今日下午一時開會（上海午夜），討論阿爾巴尼亞，外蒙，外的但及葡萄牙入會問題。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓四日電〕美國三千五百萬男女公民投票選舉全部衆議員及三分之一之參議員之前夕，共和黨之勝利已在大部份人士預料之中。參加競選之人今夜猶在各處演說，惟杜魯門總統自競選運動開始以來迄耒發過一言。衆議院全部議負共四三二席，參議員重選者共卅五席。在本屆衆院內，共和黨佔有一九二席，苟能再獲廿六席，即可取得二一六席之多數優勢。民主黨原佔有二三五席，苟僅喪失十七席，猶可保持其控制勢力。參院中共和黨原有卅九席，苟能再獲十席，即可佔上風，民主黨原有五十六席，若僅喪失七席，猶無妨於優勢之保留。兩黨在選舉前，例不免有對選舉結果之預測，民主黨主席漢納根謂：民主黨在兩院巾之席數可望再增，而共和黨主席李斯則謂：共和黨在衆院可中　　　　　　　　　　　　　　可增獲七至十四席。政治觀察家復預料有一第三黨之工黨形成，至少有四人可望領導新黨競選成功，此四人乃最近辭去商長之華萊士，前羅斯福內閣之內長，即亦因與杜魯門意見不合而辭職之伊　斯，助羅斯福總統四次競選總統成功之工業組機大會會長墨雷，及參院極左派外交政策權威發言人參議員貝伯。然此四人似均願意留在民主黨內，繼續本位工作，彼等希望在一九四八年之下屆總統選舉以前，彼等之努力以及不可避免之經濟發展可使民主黨改變機構，而成爲進步的政黨。果爾，民主黨將失去南部諸州民主黨保守份子之支持，但亦可自共和黨之自由份子取得擁護</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約四日電〕美國三千五百萬以上選舉人今日自一千餘名候選人中選舉參衆議員，主要十六州投票結果，似將指示今後兩年美國會之趨勢。共和民主兩大黨在各該州火併最烈，第八十屆國會參衆兩院由何黨控制將　　決定。此外，卅、州　　亦同時改選。選舉趨勢最堪，一意者，爲共和黨向民主黨奪取參議員九席之攻勢，此舉如吿勝利，則共和黨將於十六年來第一次取得　院控　權。該九席係由紐約，　　諸塞，米蘇里，愛達荷，蒙大　，華盛頓，丁弗吉尼亞，懷俄　及新學西哥等九州選出。民主黨並死力爭取肯塔　及加里福尼並兩州選票。以上十五州，外加無須劇烈競爭之伊利諾州，選舉結果如何，可以左右全局。多數觀察家預料：此次選舉戰可測度民衆對杜魯門政府處置肉類及其他管制之反抗程度，反對一般復復員情勢之不滿情緒。前任商長華萊土在紐約演說稱：共和黨倘若獲勝，全世界可視此爲美國反動之徵象。共和黨參議員塔夫脫則在芝加哥稱：民主共和兩黨，對外交政策幾乎一致。</p>

<h3>市長闡釋生活指數　說明編製原則祇限日用必需品　加以黃金論工資已較戰前爲優　新舊歷年底是兩大難關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於市府按月發表之生活指數，最近兩月來本市工人頗多猜疑，曾紛紛要求解釋，並請加以改進。吳市長於昨午之招待各報社負責人席上，會有所申述，謂最近兩個月來，本市工人對於市府公佈之生活指數，頗多猜疑，考査其原因，則爲各地皆編製物價指數，而本市則編製生活指數。物價指數中之範圍較廣，如飛漲之建築材料等均計算在內，指數因而逐月均呈激漲。而生活指數則不然，現時採用之工人生活指數中，僅以米，燃料，布疋等日常必需品爲基本。市府向以抑平該項基本物價爲原則，故日常必需品始終無大波動，此即生活指數，所漲極微之主要原因也。若紗價穩定後，布匹可望跌價，則十一月份之生活指數，非唯不會漲，且可能因而下降。</p>
<p>工人之所以深爲懷疑者，則因爲看到各地物價指數之頻頻上漲，同時工人等偶爾往觀一塲電影，或購買一盒洋火，即認爲物價之暴漲。然此實不足以作爲生活指數之根據，蓋物價指數與生活指數，絕對不能混爲一談，而若干洋貨及奢侈品之漲價，亦非工人之生活必需品，自不能列爲計算生活指數之根據。</p>
<p>吳市長又以種種實例，曉喩工人，由於底薪之調整，已較戰前爲優越。戰前之工資，僅足以購食米一担半，而現時每一工人之每月所入，以足購食米三担半有餘。即以黃金計算，工人今日收入亦較戰前爲優。則工人生活指數，顯已較戰前提高。又據吳市長之觀察本年陽曆年底及陰曆年底，爲兩大難關，必須勞資雙方密切合作，庶可勉强渡過。若工人再不能體諒資方在目前之困難情形，則無異於「殺鷄求蛋」，結果必定是鷄死了，而蛋亦不可得矣。</p>
<h3>深盼市節電　裨益增加生產</h3>
<p>吳市長又於招待各報社負責人會中，特別强調本市節電問題，謂目前上海一地，每日可產棉紗六萬件，若全部紗錠開工，則可達八萬件。六萬件之生產額，雖足供上海一地之需，但吾人尙須顧到其他各地之需要。現時上海棉紗之生產量，所以不能達到最高峯者，純由於電力供應之不足。故欲鼓勵生產，則必須節省用電。　吳市長又稱。節省電力辦法之實施，自難免有許多困難，但是當局所以要毅然實現，實係有所必需戰時內地之分區停電辦法，所以未施用於滬上者，蓋由於環境之不同，及當局體諒市民也。故深盼市民能自動節電，母須當局採取罰則。商店中燈光通宵，及住戶點過亮之電燈，均屬浪費，希望能自動節省，如住戶中有十盞電燈者，減爲七盞，或原係一百支光者，改爲七十支光，則對於戶內之工作無所妨礙，面對於增加生產，大有裨益也。</p>

<p>海軍察看</p>
<p>（一）據海軍總司令部艦隊指揮部負責調査此事件之胡參謀談稱：上月廿一日曾有排水量約一千八百噸之美運輸艦一艘及日駁船六隻（排水量的二百六十七噸），由日來華，當時海軍方面，曾派第三號砲艇至虬江碼頭察看，該六日船，於三日後（廿四日）離滬駛去。日前又聞有日船來滬，停泊高昌廟之第三號砲艇，又出發巡察，但未有所獲。胡參謀並稱：據聯總方面消息，該六艘日駁船，將於日內隨美運輸艦載救濟物資再度來華。</p>

<p>（二）據海關李副稅務司語記者稱：事前海關當局，並未獲悉日船進口事，事後調査，獲悉此七艘日船，其中六艘係拖船，並未裝載貨物，爲聯總由日本移送行總者，另一艘爲麥帥總部所派之護送船，船首所懸旗幟爲麥帥總部之旗幟，故進口時海關未予阻止。嗣後海關當局，因聞該項船隻曾懸掛日旗，曾函詢聯總，關於上項船隻之性質，迄今未獲答覆。李副稅務司最後並表示：海關祗負進出口商船査騐之責，對聯總，行總運輸救濟物資來往之船隻，本無權過問云云。</p>
<p>聯總拖船未懸</p>
<p>聯總及行總方面解釋如下：聯總方面承認有聯總拖船六艘，由日本駛運來華，交與行總，當由駐日美軍當局派輪一艘護送，該輪是否懸掛太陽旗，不得而知，聯總亦不負責，但該拖船六艘，則確未懸掛日旗，有當時所攝六艘拖船之照片爲證。現該六艘拖船已交行總應用。至於行總方面，對此事不願發表意見，僅承認該六艘拖船已由聯總轉交行總水運大隊，作爲運輸之用。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕地院民庭昨審理一不履行婚的案，原吿張順發，二十三歲，南通人，於本年二月二十二日，憑媒嚴韓氏，李石氏，與本地人居珠珠（廿二歲）訂婚，定本年夏曆八月初完婚，唯張順發不及等候婚期，於五月間實行「搶親」伹未成功，因「搶親」時將居珠珠之母打傷，經居母向地院控吿，張順發因傷害罪被處徒刑六月，緩刑二年。張順發心有不甘，乃延律師見狀要求居珠珠賠償損失一百六十八萬元。昨下午四時開庭時，被吿居珠珠偕母出庭，居穿淡藍旗袍，娓娓申述理由，楚楚動人，張順發於此情形之下，忽變更初衷，願放棄賠償要求，而不願解除婚的，一再聲明「要人，不要錢」。伹居珠珠則堅決表示「不願嫁他」，並稱：「他兇暴成性，敎我如何能嫁他」。原吿代理律師見張順發改變初衷，大出意料之外，即起立聲明：「代理人僅知要求賠償，今當事人要人不要錢，則代理人毫無意見」。庭上至此，以未便遽加處斷，諭九日宣判。</p>

<h3>拋石填土修堤岸　瀏河海唐部份竣工　已做四萬二千餘工　發出不航而粉八十五噸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕長江南岸自吳淞至福山沿岸之海塘堤岸，因年久失修，加之淪陷時期備遭敵僞摧毁，大都已損壞不堪，缺口達數十處之多。行總蘇寗分　成立以後，自今春二月起，即開始修復工程，並獲得水利委員會及江蘇省建廳曁當地縣政府之協助，成立江南海塘工程委員會，致力搶修工作。其中大倉瀏河一段由中國建築公司承包，一部份業已　築完竣。該公司昨特　待本市新聞界前往參觀。</p>
<p>海塘已完工者，二百八十三公尺，呈斜坡形，以木樁及塊石鉍成。該處原爲缺口三處，江水內灌已不止一次，而以今年六月間一次爲熱最猛。當時鄕民曾先行槍修，七月間中建公司承包後，八月中開始工程。據該公司工程人員談。條築情形係先以蔴袋盛土塡底，然後分前後兩排打樁，每樁長的五公尺。然後拋石塡土，上下共五六層。　將面層堆砌舖平後，堤岸即吿完成。每日工作人數最多時，約五百人左右；現爲二百餘人，均用以工代振辦法，每人每日發給行總麵粉六斤。至於木材則自福建運來，石塊自江陰蘇州等地採集。太倉全縣內之工程槪况，據該縣善後救濟協會宣佈，自薛敬塘口起至鹿鳴涇止，約長二十五公里，於本年三月底開始，由沿塘四十七鄕鎭微集工人，組成十二大除參加工作，已做四萬二千餘工，發出麵粉三千七百餘包，的合八十五噸。最險土塘已多數塡修竣事，次要者尙有不少仍在繼續塡修中。</p>
<p>行總蘇寗分署主任技正　蘇北運河工程工振局副局長屠達，及太倉縣參議長朱愷　昨亦在該處視察，並對記者等發表談話，希望各界認識海塘工程之重要。屠氏並報吿蘇寗分署之工作稱：振務分急振及建設事業兩種。除海塘工程已在進行中外，江南方面尙有揚子江堤，正和運河及省內公路橋樑等修復工程亦擬開始進行。江北方面運河之疏濬，於共軍盤踞時期，即已派人前往接洽。茲者收復以後，當可積極進行。省主席王懋功及蘇寗分署署長鄭通和，曁水利委員會沈副主任委員等，將於本月八日前往淮陰視察。</p>
<h3>復興公園暫停開放　籌備菊花盆景展　孔志清出品亦將參加</h3>

<h3>取締戶外霓虹燈　廠商營業受影響　三千餘家聯名請仍開放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據霓虹燈業中人語記者：該業自當間禁絕戶外霓虹燈後，營業額至少較前減少半數。其他琑　損失，更屬不　。例如：近來該業接受客戶所裝設之戶外霓虹燈，因適逢當局禁用，故裝後大部無法收款。目前因霓虹燈裝設，僅限室內，惟雇主有限，而同業競爭劇烈，價慘跌。長此以往，該業各廠，唯有出於停業之一途，又本市各工廠商店，以戶外霓虹燈被取締，營業亦受相當損失，故聯合三千餘家，具名蓋印，請該業轉向當局籲請，在七折用電限度以內，繼續開放戶外霓虹燈。據調査：霓虹燈並不費電，每一雙　器裝五十尺霓虹管一支，其用電量僅等於一百支光電燈一盞，惟照明之強度則過之。全市霓虹燈照明之耗電量，每日不過三百度，而全市普通電燈之耗電量，每日達六萬七千度，此中霓虹燈所佔之耗電量，不過二百廿七分之一故縱使節省戶外霓虹燈耗電所得，每月亦不過一百五十度，區區之　，於工廠用電，實屬無濟於事。反之，對於該業之打擊，則殊爲嚴重。該業現共有同業三十九家，職工共達四千餘人，故亟望當局能再考慮開放戶外霓虹燈，以體商艱，而維數千工人之生計。</p>
<h3>倫道爾案結束　高院宣判上拆駁回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕德籍間諜嫌疑犯沈克控合衆社駐華辦事處經理倫道爾誹謗一案，地院已判決倫道爾無罪，乃沈克竟尙不肯甘心，復向高院上訴，數次開審，雙方激辯甚烈，已迭誌本報。昨晨十時，高院由審判長章慶瀾，推事王健，張世傑升座後，章審判長即命倫道爾聆判，當即宣讀主文云：「上訴駁回。」按照刑事訴訟法，需判刑五年以上者，始可向最高法院再提上訴，而誹謗罪處刑至多祇有二年，故此審爲最終一審，沈克已不能再提上訴。</p>
<h3>記載公共集會者　不松成誹謗之罪</h3>
<p>高院仍支持第一審判決中受理本案之決定，認爲沈克雖係敵僑，且已爲美軍法庭檢舉爲戰犯，並由外交部列入遺送回國之名單，仍有向法院吿訴及上訴之權。</p>
<p>庭上並應倫道爾之請，解釋判決理由謂：沈克上訴之駁回，係根據刑法第三百十一條第四節，凡轉載中央及地方之公吿，法院公開審判，及公共集會者，不構成誹謗之罪，而倫道爾四月十五日之記載，係根據美軍官方之發佈。倫道爾之消息旣係自美軍記者招待會上得來，則此消息內容之是否眞確，即與本案無關。又昨日判決時，沈克及某代理人姚　　第律師均未到庭。</p>

<h3>吳市長宣佈　管制紗布意見　保證消滅黑市穩定市價　利潤優厚廠商應予合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午三時，在市府會議室招待本市各報社負責人，計到潘公展，王芸生，李子寬，詹文滸，趙敏恒，陳訓悆，嚴獨鶴，祝百英等。</p>
<p>吳市長報吿此次紡管會處理棉紗棉布經過。</p>
<p>關於棉紗問題，市長認爲必須嚴加管理，統一價格，並分配於眞正需要者。關於取締棉紗之黑市問題，曾於本月一日提出四項具體辦法，即爲（一）無論期貨與否，自十月廿五日起，一律照廿支紗一百七十五萬元之議價出售。以前期貨售價有差異者，多退少補。（二）除期貨買主有優先權外，餘紗不得拒絕出售。（三）各廠商外銷棉紗數量，應報會備査。（四）無論期貨現貨，應將買主姓名，住址，數量，詳細記載，並報會備査。</p>
<p>多退少補並無困難</p>
<p>吳市長謂上項四辦法，若能切實施行，可保證於本月上旬棉紗黑市可以絕跡。然當該項辦法提出後，廠商對於辦法中之第一條，認爲有考慮之必要，因爲在商業習慣上，似有未合，且可能引起更多糾紛，故再三請求考慮修正但認爲並無根據，不能成立。市長的答覆是：若廠商能有更妥善之辦法，在本月上旬使本市棉紗之黑市絕跡，則第一條辦法，亦可不堅特。否則，原定辦法，仍須嚴格實施。</p>
<p>抑平物價從紗做起</p>
<p>市長認爲欲抑平物價，則抑平紗價，自屬要圖，對於管理棉紗問題，各界意見紛紜，有人認爲在目前供與求不能平均時，則棉紗不能管理。但市長之意見則適得其反。認爲正唯求過於供，所以要加以管理。現時全國鈔錠之運轉數，的爲二百五十萬錠，僅及戰前之半數，而戰後人民對棉紗布之需要，更爲殷切，即使恢復至戰前之五百萬錠後，仍感未足，則締紗產量，故必須妥爲以管理。</p>
<p>管理方法分三步驟</p>
<p>管理之方法，可分三個步驟：（一）控制紗之產量，此點容易做到，因用電之控制權，在於市府。（二）控制紗之價格，此番議定紗價以廿支價每件一百七十五萬元爲標準，事前曾煞費硏究工夫，所議定之價格中，除將成本，利息，合法利潤等，一一計入外，並已加入發展機會之利潤。依該項議價計算，估計每件紗利潤已頗可觀，若廠商仍覺太低，唯有認爲無理可喩（三）控制複製品各工業產品之價格，如機器染織業，針織業，毛巾被毯業，手帕業，手工棉織業，內衣織造業等，均予直接配紗，在未調査完畢之前，暫予六折發配，據抽査後之估計，實實足敷應用棉紗之價格旣已穩定，則複製品之價格，自可加以合理之限制。現規定複製品之合理利潤爲百分之十，然僅限於本市一地，若運銷外埠，則規定其利潤爲百分之五。</p>
<p>所定紗價並非固定</p>
<p>吳市長又謂：現定一百七十五萬元之紗價，並非絕對固定的，視棉花之漲落，亦可有伸縮性。但謂若上列辦法，得以按步就班，分別實施，則渠有絕對把握”可使物價不至暴漲暴跌。</p>

<p>烚赤昨繼續在人心向榮下，盤旋而昇，晨開二三七萬三，此價即由大衆需求而趨漲，逐漸向榮，十時後央行以二三八萬七五之價，配給一二〇條，此後仍無回低之象，求戶依然股切，近午升至二三九萬以上，午後賡續見昻，隔日交割曾喊高至二四一萬以上，後遭壓力而回平，結果較前收續升一萬八，飾金念五萬四，紋銀平銀元微昻，暗拆銀根稍鬆，息價在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣形勢呆滯，美鈔暗市約四〇七〇元至四一二〇元之間，較前日微低，港票受電匯軟化之影響，繼續疲落，結果較前日跌十元，港電匯昨更低，銷路毫無，昨八六五元尙屬有供少求，印匯一〇五五元亦屬賣盤，英匯一四〇〇〇元有供無求，美匯牌價不更，對做奄無。</p>
<h3>統丙回跌　雜牌上漲</h3>
<p>公債昨大戶福源仍有納胃，統丙晨開一五九〇元，四樓某戶脫售之下，中途曾跌至一五〇〇元，福源等乘低維持，高價見一六七〇元，股市不振，人心不無打擊，臨收在一六〇〇元左右掙扎，結果較則收回跌一〇〇元，甲乙丁漲一〇〇元，統戊亦升七十元，成交的六百萬元。</p>
<h3>多頭獲利出籠　華股乍起乍落</h3>
<p>華股昨初開尙現平穩，惟人心未見俏俐，開後微露疲軟，金融價即連袂吸收，得以支持，引起空方抵補，各股板露秀色，　旋而昻，中途形勢恍惚，在高價時乍起乍落，十一時後高價經大戶多頭若一七六號等獲利出籠下，檯面見鬆，空方乘機頻加壓迫，開始回小，但十一時半後，低價忽多補空，一度反動，終以獲利了結者，不在少數，午刻散多恐慌，再起賣風，谷股微露怯疲，但尙在晨低價之上，較前收計熱股永紗景福新光勤興美亞各升百分之三左右，信和獨漲半成强，冷股則漲多於跌，午後上塲又穩，無如獲利多方有售，套利者逢高脫手，堅後漸疲，檯面帮再來放空，一八五號亦賣，永紗遂退至午收價左右，慶帮等逢低維持，漸告盤上，人心向榮，臨收尙挺，結果較前收計熱股永紗升百分之二新光好百分之四，美亞勤興景福漲半成光景，信和獨升百分之八，冷股新亞永公麗安五和各升半成，火柴大通景綸微升，餘者稍挫，成交總額計一四三二萬股，塲外各股尙形平靜。</p>

<h3>財政部嚴令取締地下錢莊將歛跡</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕自財部嚴令取締地下錢莊以來，京十餘家地下錢莊均銷聲匿跡，不若以前活躍，加以放貸利率有高達三角者，最低亦在一角八上下，且放貸均無保障，而市塲各業倒風甚盛，易放難收，所担風險太大，該業中人均具戒心，自財部准許行莊申請復業後得此正當途徑，均擬參加，故本年十二月底前各地下錢莊均將自動收手。　財部日前電令中央銀行取締高利貸，央行稽核處已通飭各行莊遵辦，茲悉當局決將加强取締地下錢莊，並對於凡未經核准而先行復業之各地銀行錢莊，均將限期勒令停業，聞此項未經核准而復業之行莊，雖迭經取締，但在江浙兩省各縣內，迄今尙有許多，未經核准而擅自復業之行莊存在，當局對於此等行莊，決勒令彼等於年底以前，一律停業，至於不用銀行錢莊名義，僅用企業公司或甚至根本無名義，而背皮包之地下錢莊，搜放高利貸，根本係觸犯法律之行爲，一經査獲屬實，決將由法院以法律嚴厲處置云。</p>

<h3>焦炭去路漸廣</h3>
<p>焦炭自白煤塊價格頻昻以來，用戶大多購買力轉弱，均先後採用其他燃料代用，焦炭應時而被多數用戶採購，目前焦炭之實銷量已月超三千公噸，焦炭除本地將中興烟煤屑用土法煉成及與淞焦炭廠出品之外，均依靠外埠輸入，以漢口萍鄉焦藍田焦及徐州井陘焦爲大宗，除本地土法煉成之淸水中興仍售八十萬元高價外，其他焦煤之價均爲四十五萬元至五十萬元，僅白煤塊價之半。</p>

<h3>生油猛跌　米麥雜糧平疲</h3>
<p>米市客貨登記一萬二千餘石，南北粳米均挫千元，白元呆滯，跌一二千元，陰元高定决疲，秈米產地堅挺，形居平站，小麥亦回平，粉市內地來源略有，問小三五百元，門售雜牌麵粉限價爲每包二萬零五百元正，黃豆近聞東北又將有大批抵申，人心虛軟，價格疲降三五百元，豆餅汕厦進取，惟廠方供給尙多，回小一二百元，油市今因靑島來貨湧旺，店胃轉懈，生油猛跌六七千元，豆油淸油平正，蔴油相仿，苞米下降五六百元，紅糧來貨不多，依然堅挺，蠶豆閩帮問津，來源仍稀，盤漲千元，生仁南洋及太街仍有胃納，再見高翔，步升一二千元，芝蔴到存不多，續漲二三千元。</p>
<h3>平厚呢俏利</h3>
<p>呢羢近因天氣溫煖，各地實銷未能進展，雖次第有種種利買消息，貨價始終平穩，昨茶會上祇有平厚呢一種尙形俏利，頭號每碼喊估九萬五千元，二號八萬元，三號六萬五千元，客帮添辦頗股，本廠貨一無產出，舶來品運到甚寡，市面有軋缺之象。</p>
<h3>浙東新桕油上市　成本增高市價亦跟漲</h3>
<p>柏油浙東金蘭一帶，已有新袖上市，每天可收一二十件，價格爲每市擔十萬元，最近來訊謂中國植物油料廠曾辦過卅件，十萬〇三千元，杭州交卸，聞該廠尙有胃口，因新貨初見，來源若斷若續，不易多數採辦，惟市面已有標準，此後非有旺到，不易見鬆，且今冬年令較上年爲歉，銷塲因各處等待新貨，將來去路決不弱於往年，欲廉更不容易，至於浙西嘉興一帶，年令似較上年爲優，柏子亦已見樣，市價大槪各處均在每石三萬元左右，合柏油成本須十萬元以上，故最初雖有內地行家拋售每市擔七萬五千元，旋即加售九萬元，近已增至十萬元，而售者尙少，本埠各行始尙望廉，近來觀察環境，似漲多而廉少，欲思預進定貨，然已無售客，頗不易落手，蓋亦人同此心也。昨日人造絲黑市交易尙好，各貨以半光價爲最俏，大起十餘萬元，一二〇號老裝天橋有光貨，上午喊價平平，下午因新裝貨價做高至三百十七萬元，最大喊二十萬元，是以亦跟隨喊大五萬元，結果老裝比上日大五萬元，新裝大十萬元，一二〇號雜牌有光及一五〇號有光，乏人過問，價喊上日原盤，廠經一堅穩如上日，不過交易甚淸寂，綢貨市况仍在，不景氣中，被面昨疲落二三萬元，華錦縐做三千二百元至三百元，人絲羽紗做三千四百元至五百元，視其貨物好决而定。</p>
<h3>紗布均略見活潑　廠家塞出細紗獨見呆滯　布價跌進成本去路略動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市續趨挺秀，京蕪及內地等客納胃甚健，俱以中小型二十支紗爲對象，二十支重磅貨亦有相當數額，是以各牌又升三四萬，卅二支細紗及四十二支雙股線，因有複製品工廠塞出銀月立馬藍鳳等牌甚多，且去化殊呆，故市價毫無進展，目下之紗市，當局雖有抑平之信心，然所配售者類多遠期貨，設若秋銷一且再見發動，現貨恐不敷銷，頗有重漲之可能也。</p>
<p>布市雖紡建掛牌下降，而本街及杭嘉湖等地走化稍健，反呈堅定之勢，査連日來布價之傾瀉殊猛，客帮咸呈觀望，本街櫃銷亦極寥落，近以市價已跌進成本以內，加以暗息之高，織造廠商產品之虧耗頗重，但時當銷令，棉布銷路如此呆滯，按諸往常，似無此理，是以一般心理，成以天氣倘轉冷，走化尙多，或可轉榮也。</p>
<h3>火機花竟無法銷售　棉農大受影響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕浦東沿海一帶，係屬沙田，泥質帶鹹，不利種稻，因之該處農民，都種植雜糧花生及棉花爲大宗，俗稱火機花，專銷本市各紗廠爲紡十六支以下之原料。本年外棉大批絡　進口，紗廠採用外棉，而屛絕本花，取其價廉而品高。浦東所產之火機，竟至無法銷售，加之本年秋雨連綿，收穫不佳，每畝的採七八十斤，合之現價，僅有三萬元左右，農民終年辛苦，非但種籽肥料人工無所取償，而佃農之田租，亦無所出，農村破產，在指顧間。政府雖有農貸之舉，但無門徑之棉農，仍無法貸得。即使貸得，日後將何以歸還？影響所及，勢將引起農民减種棉花之興趣，明年棉田减少，勞所必然。紗廠正感原料之不繼，而一棉農之棉花，竟至無人問訊，亦一今日經濟界矛盾現象之一也。</p>
<h3>新針眉激漲</h3>
<p>茶葉市况，　來內銷甚平，洋莊交易，祁門陳花香，脫手依然順利，高紅茶英莊買勢亦不退，新綠茶因出口行急趕船期，不足之數額，紛來彌補，故市氣殊秀，且溫州新針眉到源較滯，求者更切，行情遂急遽直上，結果每担以十萬元做開，比前狂跳一萬五千元有奇云。　〔本報北平四日電〕週來平津黃金價格，因受時局及幣値影響，復見上昇，週初與週末比較，上昇萬元，津金價更昂出廿五萬元關，白銀聯帶上昇，週初每兩爲二千二，週末昇至二千四，聞因白銀多經津滬等地，轉運香港孟買倫敦之故，美鈔因有取締黑市之傳說，其價始終徘徊四千元邊緣，糧價稍低，然與上海比較，仍屬特高，麵粉每袋三萬七，稻米每斤七九〇元，棉布價格尙稱安定，燃料因井陘煤無法北來，平綏路亦劫後破碎，暗勢仍堅，肉類因張垣已通，價格見低，烟價尙平穩。</p>
<h3>聯合商場雖多　實銷並不見旺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕邇來本市美式攤販之聯合市塲，及國貨市塲等，風起雲湧。所陳商品，無不貶價競銷，以廣招徠。惟據調查所得，該項集體市塲，其實際營業，並不旺盛。而若干商塲之組設，更不無投機意味。惟影響一般百貨業之營業，則頗深鉅。緣百貨業一年中之旺季，應以近兩月間爲頂峯。惟近來業務，未見起色。普通店家，平均每日所售，充其量只能抵付職工之薪津。所幸百貨業中營業，多持穩健，故在目前高利貸，營業淸淡，購買力薄弱之楚歌聲中，尙能勉維殘局，蓋尙圖營業能再行吾極泰來也。</p>
<h3>美棉又跌</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約四日電」今日棉市因受紐奧林斯拋售影響，棉花遠期被迫跌價，出售之貨，大半由紗廠收買。收盤跌每包二角五分至三元。</p>

<p>〔路透社美國坦納西州孟斐斯四日電〕喬治亞州衆議員丕斯在衆院小組會議，討論美棉前途及物價管制時，警吿美國棉農，勿於一九四七年度坍產至一千二百五十萬包以上。丕氏謂，棉農倘於來年對於棉花生產不加限制，恐難免蹈一九一三七年以後生產過剩之覆轍。</p>

<h3>主席壽辰這一天　祝嘏空氣滿首都</h3>
<p>— 十月卅一日南京訊　本報特約記者丁匡華</p>
<p>今天是蔣主席六十華誕，歡聲遍滿全國的每一角落，祝　運動，早經展開，中樞當局以主席畢生精力，都貢獻在黨國身上，爲了崇敬他老人家的　功偉蹟，本敎育百年樹人之議，於是確定了獻校爲祝壽的唯一禮物，南京市政府首先響應獻校六十所，以爲首倡。各省市的獻校成績，我們從報紙上看來數目是很驚人的，特別是私立學校，牠們自願的歷史悠久的校名取消，改名「中正」學校，可見主席德威感召之偉大。南京市黨部也發動全市然員捐獻中正圖書館一所，以奠定首都民敎的基礎。祝壽一天一天的臨近，獻禮也一天一天的擴大，蔣主席爲節省人力物力財力，特於三十日宣吿謝絕祝壽，這表現主席的人格是何等的崇高素樸。勵志社的全市拜壽，中央黨部的簽名致敬，國民政府的熱烈祝賀，南京學生萬人大合唱，……都一一播入主席的耳鼓。蔣主席爲了减少文武百官的酬酢忙碌，不得不作避壽的郊遊了。</p>
<h3>壽星淸早即起家庭拜壽形如</h3>
<p>這一天，壽星一大早就起來了，家庭的拜壽當然不可避免，兩個公子，媳婦，孫兒，樂叙一堂，孔委員祥熙於三十日也特地由滬來京祝壽，八點鐘以後，主席曾趨車巡視國府，返官邸休息不久，即偕夫人及馬帥夫婦作避壽的郊遊。京滬路特備花車六節，佈置極爲華麗，車內「壽」字，到處可見。主席一行，係在和平門上車，隨行的有兪濟時局長，陳伯莊局長，及美名作家魯斯。主席沿途含笑接受民衆歡呼，小遊無錫太湖，晚上搭原車返京。</p>
<p>今天南京的每一角落，全爲祝壽空氣所籠罩。街道上國旗飄揚，爆竹連天，中央廣播電台，益世電台，靑年電台，竟日播送祝壽節目。國防部新聞局繪製的巨大主席玉照，聳立街頭，成爲市民最賞識的珍品。交通要衢上的時計，嵌上「壽」字在虹燈上打圈子，幾處大商塲，高搭「河山幷壽」的彩徘，顯得玲瓏，也顯得巍峨。麵館裏生意特別興隆，老百姓在這一天吃碗壽麵，替</p>
<p>主席祝壽，靠　主席洪福，意義也是很深長的。汽車上滿貼祝壽標語，在萬馬奔騰中駛來駛去，也替主席華誕中添上熱鬧。</p>
<h3>中樞要人齊集　簽名祝壽致敬</h3>
<p>國民政府今天佈置的壽堂，簡單而嚴肅。上午八時起，中樞各要人開始簽名祝壽，吳文官長鼎昌，吳代參軍長思豫，陳前主計長其采先後率領全體職員，依决簽名祝壽，白芨蒼蒼的戴院長季陶，周副院長鍾嶽，於九時許聯袂蒞臨國府，在特備之紅祝壽册上簽名祝賀。十時以後，外國使節先後蒞臨，均以含笑的表情，替簽名册上寫富有歷史性的壽字壽禮。特別引人注意的是蒙藏代表的祝壽。他們着其特有的各式衣服，簽上不同的字跡，國府今天特設壽席一百桌，宴請全體與賀人員，長公子蔣經國則親爲一一答謝。</p>
<p>中央黨部今天在禮堂正中高懸壽字，中央置松柏延年樹，上綴紅綠電燈，顯得異常輝煌，黨國元老吳稚暉先生到得最早，是簽名致敬的第一名，他老人家今天特別興奮，巡視禮堂一週，當其看到當塗縣民代表呈獻「千秋」人」的壽區時，點首良久。九時起，戴傳賢，于右任，孫科，王寵惠，陳果夫，張厲生，梁寒操等先後蒞臨，簽名祝壽，獻上壽文，讀祝壽詞，忙得執事人員不亦樂乎。在京黨務工作人員，及京郊各地代表，均紛紛前臨祝賀</p>
<h3>勵志社門前人潮　十萬市民熱烈參加簽名</h3>
<p>首都各界祝壽的壽堂，是設於勵志社的禮堂上，因此中山東路的逸仙橋以至黃埔路一帶，車水馬龍，人山人海，是今天首都唯一熱烈所在。爲了維持壽堂內的秩序，車輛一律不能入內，門首擺着十二張臺桌，每個祝壽的人，先要在那兒簽名，祝壽是順着先後秩序的。由六十人爲一組，招待員整理他們的行列，極爲忙碌，每個人佩發一個紅綢金字的方形「壽」字，以資紀念，禮堂的佈置是這樣的：壽字霓虹燈懸於當中，「萬壽無疆」四字，則縣於壽台之上，旁邊掛着湘繡的八仙祝壽及王母獻壽的大彩圖。吳稚老親題「成吉思加動西回伊始，華盛頓再主北美之中」的籌聯，也放在這裏陳列，八時正，首都各界祝壽典禮開始。馬市長，洪蘭友，袁守謙代表主席受禮，黃仁霖答禮，着的是藍袍黑掛，越發顯得心廣體胖了。接着馬元放，蕭贊育，陳裕光，沈祖懋，代表南京八十三萬市民獻校獻館，爲祝賀蔣主席六十華誔的永古千秋的禮物。陳果夫先生的封翁勤士先生，也由兩人扶着前臨祝嘏。白崇禧，陳誠，鹿鍾麟，孔祥熙，黃鎭球，周至柔，朱世明，張鎭等，均先後親臨拜壽。主席長公子蔣經國，一一與賀客點首握手，喜氣洋洋，是最引人注目的一個。拜壽以後，大家却擁到另一室參觀主席生活照片。勵志社大禮堂滿室佈置主席六十年來的生活珍片一千餘幀。記者步入室內首先看到的是主席北伐時放大的英姿，腰橫秋水，氣吞畏虹，我們瞻望　主席的威容，仍是不减當年，從主席畢生的生活照片裏看來，他是何等親民愛物。誓師北伐，領導抗戰，慰問軍民，愛護袍澤，都一一活躍紙上。而蔣主席合家團聚的玉照，更爲市民特別欣賞。自晨至暮，記者一刻兒未曾離去，祇見簽名紙換了一張又是一張，疊厚了一大堆，據記者最低的估計，當在五萬人以上，還有小兒婦孺，照這個比例推算，十萬人的的祝壽，絕對祗有多，不會少。</p>
<h3>紀念特刊　滿街飛舞</h3>
<p>首都各報爲發行祝壽特刋，搜集主席往昔的生活照片，有的在三個月前已經開始工作，微稿撰稿，短兵相接，競爭形成白熱化，今天和盤托出了。今天各報均擴大篇幅，取材都以祝壽爲主題。一大早，報紙滿街飛舞，市民爭相購買。各報雖然坩印幾千甚至萬份，但不到下午三時，已一掃而空。中航公司帶來的上海報紙也爲之搶購一空，連原有的訂戶，祇好另行設於補送。老牌的申報，今天出了五大張，其中有幾張珍貴的蔣主席生活玉照，最受讀者歡迎。文化界的競爭，也正是祝壽聲中的一段佳話。　今天天高氣爽，日麗風和，正象徵着我中華民國億萬斯年，蔣主席萬壽無疆。</p>

<h3>到蘇北前綫去</h3>
<p>— 十月廿五粱垜訊　本報記者凌松壽</p>
<p>運河綫打通後，蘇北局勢已快近全面肅淸的階段。</p>
<p>隨着范公堤上戰事之展開，記者啣社命有東綫之行。</p>
<p>廿二日，爲了車子忙了一個整天。客車固然沒有；而且海泰綫兩側的肅淸工作尙未完成，爲了穩妥起見，勢不得不請求軍方協助。</p>
<p>由於東綫戰事以八十三師爲主體，該師有一後方師部設在泰縣，專爲供給前方給養。記者第一步乃先到該部。據副官處林科長說，車子有是有的，不過一定什麼時候開，却沒有把握。前方有什麽需要，那隨時可以出發。他答應如有車子開出，便臨時通知。　道一方面可算還沒有肯定，新聞記者完全要爭取時間，假如再躭延三五天後，東合一經收復，那麼此行就失去了時間性。因此記者又向二十五師一四八旅王參謀長那裏商洽。參謀長介紹旅部車站的胡指導員爲記者籌劃，可是會了兩次，沒有見面；到了黃昏時候，正焦慮聞，忽然八十三師副官處送來了通知，明晨六時有專車出發前綫。一見之下，滿腔心事皆消，快慰無量。</p>
<p>廿三日早晨四點鐘便起身，在晨風淡蕩，晨星明滅中，記者嚮往於一百六十里以外的東戰塲烽火。</p>
<p>六時到師部，車子因有他事牽絆住，直到十時方開出。由師部汽車連連副「阿大哥」（他有這樣一個綽號快十年了，師部裏上至師長，下至士兵，都這樣稱呼着）。駕駛，同行的還有十九旅五十六團政治部羅主任。</p>
<p>車子以每小時三十公里的速度前進。途中碰到許多還鄕隊，挺着胸，掮着槍向東走着，同車的人說：「這才眞是民衆意識甦醒的表現」，十十時卅一分到姜埝，這塊地方，三個月之間，記者已來過三次。第一次是剛收復後；第二次是馬溝戰事發生後，和杭舟兄隨着廿五師一〇八旅吳參謀長來此巡視；今日第三次到此，車行太速過眼忽忽，想來總又該進步一點，繁榮一點了！</p>
<p>由姜埝東行，經十分鐘到白米，這一段路面，現在仍不時遭共軍破壞。所好護路工作的組織很完善，隨時破壞，隨時修復，倒還不至斷絕交通，妨礙軍運。可是路面上凸凹不平之處總還不免，車子從上面經過，顚簸得很厲害。</p>
<p>過了曲塘，十一時廿分到海安，下車稍息。在路旁一家小點心店中，吃了些點心；「羣蠅亂飛」，骯髒不堪。同車的羅主任，目的地已到，相與握別。十一時五十分，我們由海安北進，車子過了海安西口，很大的一座大王廟，僅剩有山門前的兩只石獅子還完好，其餘的屋子，不管是大雄寳殿或是禪房，莫不是破的破，倒的倒，牠們已被砲火作了一番西洋宗教的「洗禮」了。海安外圍，士城環繞，蒺藜四佈，表現出戒備的緊張，記者於此更想到共軍圍攻十九日的一齣全武行的慘酷塲面！</p>
<p>十二時〇五分，抵買家集，與車子同一方向出發的，還有許多某部的百粤健兒，現在是農歷十月，嶺上的梅花早該含苞待放了，他們八年以來，轉戰大江南北，如今在濱海的蘇北，張弔民伐罪之旗，不知曾吾想到他們故鄕的梅花？</p>
<p>賣家集迤北，共軍丟下才築了不久的工事很多，在靠近富安的地方，還有一座小型飛機塲，國軍和居民，正在那兒協力整理着</p>
<p>十二時廿五分到富安，破坦殘壁，相對聳立，所有該鎭房屋，差不多沒有一所沒有彈痕；劫後災黎，正折着殘餘的屋子，也不知道是不堪居住拆了比較乾凈呢，還是預備重新起造？某部有救濟車多輛，漆着血紅的十字，在辦理着善後救濟，這就是四晝夜砲火的結果。</p>
<p>本來我們預定的目的地是富安。但是八十三師師部，爲了配合戰局的發展，已經移置安置，於是車子　續北進。十二時四十分抵安豐外圍，記者已淸晰地聽到前綫的砲聲。</p>
<p>安應街道很狹，鎭東通楡公路有一座橋樑，被共軍破壞，還沒有修好。所以車子必須穿過鎭的中心。街上擁擠了十多輛車子。我們的車子退又不能，只好招呼前面的車子後退，而我們暫且停在路旁。這時，師部的軍務處王處長到海安去，我們在路旁相見。王處長很親熱地吿訴我前綫的戰况；並且說：「八十三師全體官兵，將十二分歡迎你這位『　記者第一人」所帶來的精神上無窮的安慰。」　費了半個多鉀點功夫，車子總算通過。到師部時，已是一時半了，李天霞將軍時在前綫指揮，聞訊特由常高參孝德來迎記者，乃隨同前往前綫，進謁師長。</p>
<p>與李師長相隔三個月了。見面之下，師長高興非常，談到我寫的那篇「李天霞將軍風度」，他笑着說：「寫得太誇張了。」可是他也承認，泰縣人對他和他對泰縣人的關係，總覺得特別親密一點！</p>
<p>這次國軍由海安向北推進，李師長每日均親臨前綫指揮，他向常高參和記者說：「這種戰事，主管長官不上前，選成什麽話說？」</p>
<p>前進指揮所很簡單，就設在一個草棚內。兩張大桌，權充辦公桌，電話機和軍用地圖都擺在這上面，范公堤上，若干萬人民的幸福，就在這很單調的塲合中決定。</p>
<p>常高參大的四十歲右的年紀，有一只腿在民國廿七年武漢外　萬家嶺之役負傷，到現在還有點跛。他終日和師長在一塊兒參贊着戎機，是前進指揮所中主要的角色。　爲了協助推進工作，加强戰事效果，空軍總部特派飛機一中隊使用於蘇北，於是在指揮所旁邊，便少不了空軍聯絡組。該組設於一輛卡車中，隨時跟着指揮所走，空軍總部還特派技術人員在此，負責管理陸上與空軍聯絡的任務。</p>
<p>前進指揮所的右前方，有一座門。共軍在上面寫着「解放門」，兩旁有一副對聯：「懲奸抒正氣，生產固國基。」師長囑我攝了一張照片，隨即飭士兵塗去。</p>
<h3>距火綫僅三華里　街頭情形異常安靜</h3>
<p>安豐是廿二日淸晨收復的，記者到安豐時，不過才是第二天。可是街上情形安靜異常，小孩子們很自在地滾着銅錢；假如不是隊部來來往往的話，眞使你不知道這是一個剛收復了一天而距離火錢不到三華里的鎭市。</p>
<p>四時許，記者由前綫回到寓所休息。寓所是師部副官處商借的一家朱姓民房。房主人挺好，對我們招待無微不至，我們有什麽需要，也都有求必應。記者從泰縣帶了幾份申報去，他很高興地借去看，並喟然嘆息着說：「有七八年看不到這種報紙了！」他們對於十月十三日本報各地特寫欄內的「獨劍攻心』和「李天霞將軍風度」幾篇，覺到特別的有味兒。</p>
<p>記者想從他們口中打聽打聽共軍盤踞時間的情形，他們堅持不說，雖經多方勸釋，毫不生效。他們僅說：「有些爲虎作倀的人，國軍非重辦不可！」聽到這一羣又陌生而又親熱的同胞的話，記者湧起了無窮的感慨！</p>
<p>晚上和副官處一位耿科長聊天。他吿訴我：「我初到這兒來，爲了某一件事，想和區公所接洽一下。就問一個老百姓，區公所在什麼地方。你知道他對我怎樣講？哼！他對我說：你們的區公所在那兒那兒，我們的區公所（指共黨機構）早已搬啦！」請問，這又是一件什麽樣的事實？本來，鄕村民衆，知識簡單，加以淪陷時間過久，此種情形，自所難免；可是，當局又將有什麽計劃來從事於對他們作「再敎育」呢？</p>
<p>今日戰事沉寂，僅有斷續的砲聲。在前綫時，李師長很興奮地指着軍用地圖吿訴記者：「梁垜已進入了砲兵的射程，我們由溱潼方面推進的部隊，也越過時埝，進抵某地，右翼部隊正與共軍隔河對峙着，很可能明天把梁垛順利的拿下來。」　東台以南的最大據點，就只剩了這一個梁垜了。記者正準備着從此處踏進范公堤的門戶—東台。</p>

<h3>希臘的演變　美蘇英展開爭奪戰　內亂同時繼續進行</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>希臘最近的演變，顯示九月一日的公民複決雖然決定國　　　，但是並沒有減輕希臘當前緊張的局而，强國爲圖控　希臘血進行的鬥爭，反而愈演愈烈。美國，英國和蘇聯　續爲了這個土地雖然貧瘡，可是軍略上極端重要的半島互　角逐。</p>
<p>最近美國的新式航空母艦「羅斯福」號及其護衛的軍艦、曾經到過雅典作「親善」訪問，表演美國的海軍實力。英國的地中海艦隊也要在希臘海岸一帶演習。陸軍部雖然在草擬英軍撤離希臘的計劃，可是革國的海軍依然可以控制希臘的局勢。</p>
<p>蘇聯在地巾海方面旣無軍隊亦無軍艦，可是正在使用她的外交武器。蘇聯駐希大使奉召返國，表示她對公民複決結果的不滿。在巴黎和會中，蘇聯代表團抨擊希臘政府不遺餘力，並且支持阿爾巴尼亞和保加利亞對希臘的要求。在聯合國大會中，蘇聯又要求聯合各國報告在非敵性國家土地上所留駐的軍隊，當然英國留駐於希臘的軍隊也包括在內。</p>
<p>在希臘國內，左翼政黨認爲公民複決的結果不公。保皇份子和贊成共產主義者間飄忽無定的內戰，仍在繼續進行中，每星期死傷甚多。</p>
<p>地位重要　英美決不入鬆</p>
<p>大國對於希臘之所以如此重視，乃因希臘是巴爾幹半島上惟一不受蘇聯控制的國家。蘇聯和她東歐的友人決心把勢力擴充到希臘去，英美和希臘的保皇政府決心防止蘇聯勢力的侵入，鬥爭的情况是極激烈的。</p>
<p>誰都知道希臘北部國境一帶是政治衝突的搖籃，阿爾巴尼亞人，希臘人，南斯拉夫人，馬其頓人和保加利亞人雜居其間。蘇聯所提倡的思想哲學，使這些混雜的種族分成兩個營陣。斯拉夫人，阿爾巴尼亞人和若干希臘人主張組織斯拉夫聯盟，由南斯拉夫的蒂托領導，其範國將自多瑙河流域直達地中海海岸。</p>
<p>這一個龐大的集團將由莫斯科領導，希臘當然要竭盡所能防止道個泛巴爾幹夢想的實現。希臘境內的少數民族對於蒂托和附和蘇聯者是有用的工具，爲反抗起見，阿爾巴尼亞境內的希臘少數民族，對於提倡國家主義的希臘保皇領袖也是極有用處的。</p>
<p>希臘東部的海岸綫極長，愛琴海中的島嶼星羅棋佈，控制着地中海的入口。在該方面，薩隆尼卡是一個極好的海軍根據地。這個重要的海港成爲泛巴爾幹活動的溫床，爲時已久，現在保加利亞極想取而得之，以謀在愛琴海方面獲得一個「窗戶」。假如薩隆尼卡落入斯拉夫國家的手中，那麽東歐各國就可以獲得一個海軍根據地，從那裏不消一夜就可以直駛地中海了。</p>
<p>特港問題　對希極關重要</p>
<p>同時南斯拉夫與義大利對特里埃斯特的爭奪（事實上是蘇聯和英美的爭奪），對於希臘也極關重要。進出特港的船隻，必須經過希臘的西海岸。對蘇聯友好的阿爾巴尼亞控制這個水道的北部，而南部則在希臘的手中。假如蘇聯的勢力擴充到了希臘，那麼亞德里亞海將完全進入蘇聯的掌握了。</p>
<p>再者，希臘半島伸入地中海中，而四强外畏會議的決定將杜特根尼斯羣島給予希臘，使該國的國境幾達近東。所以希臘如在親英美派的手中，就可以保護英國海上的生命綫，不然就有威脅英國船雙在地中海中移動的危險</p>
<p>此外，韃靼海峽問題最近也鬧得很厲害，而和希臘又是有密切關係的。蘇聯亟欲控制這個自黑海通往黑海的水道，可是英美竭力反對。在這個領域內，土耳其和希臘是僅有的兩個由反共政府控制的國家。希臘如其左傾，將使土耳其的歐洲部份實際上陷人親蘇政府的包圍，蘇聯控制韃靼海峽可更進一步了。所以土耳其對希臘國王復辟的消息，是非常歡迎的。</p>
<p>凡此種種，都足以說明希臘如何爲各國所重視的理由。由於地理上的關係，希臘是自巴爾幹心臟區至地中海中心的一個政治軍事活動根據地</p>

<p>在道七天內，國際上充滿了和諧的空氣，尤是斯達林元帥向合衆社記者發表的談話，否認美蘇兩國間的關係，有增無减的緊張，並表示蘇聯對於美國軍艦駛入地中海，並不十分關切。同時又率直表示：蘇聯眞懷有和平的意向，他說蘇聯並沒有原子炸彈，且蘇聯西部受大戰的摧毁，損失慘重，欲言恢復舊觀，非有十年的工夫不可。這一番談話，確是安定目前世局的一種因素，英美法諸國，無不表示歡迎，而認爲世界合作的前途，大有希望了。惟在斯達林談話中却有一段，涉及邱吉爾，攻擊他有煽動第三次大戰的企圖；因此引起邱吉爾的不滿，乃在英國發表演說，反唇相譏。蘇聯駐在國外的軍隊總額，邱吉爾堅稱有二百師之衆，而斯達林則謂僅有六十師，於是二百與六十之爭爭議，也就成爲國際上惹人注意的問題了。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫反美如故</p>
<p>斯達林的談話雖然含有親美反英的作用；但是在國際上所引起的反響是相當良好的。尤其是美國人民，亟欲與蘇聯和平相處者，莫不表示熱烈的歡迎；一般政治外交家也認爲：只要斯達林的談話，是他的由衷之言，不僅在口頭說說而已，且將見諸行動；則美蘇關係的好轉，就會在我們眼前出現的。接着蘇聯外長莫洛托夫又於三十日在聯合國大會發表演說，提出四項建議：（一）世界各國實行普遍性的裁减軍備，（二）禁止使用原子炸彈作戰；（三）安全理事會應發揮其維付世界和平的功效；（四）早日成立託管理事會。</p>
<p>這四項建議，在原則上當爲世界各國所贊成，尤其是美國決無表示異議的這理。但是在莫洛托夫的演辭中，却充滿了反美言論，他抨擊美國利用原子能爲其外交政策的後盾，藉以威脅他國。同時又運用其金元外交的策略，企圖控制整個世界。對於美國軍艦駛人地中海，亦加以攻擊；其發表的見解，與斯達林的談話，不啻南轅北轍，背道而馳，誠令人懷疑今日的蘇聯也採取雙重外交政策了。美國國務卿貝爾納斯首先指出莫洛托夫的演說與斯達林的談話，自相矛盾；同時美國出席聯合國大會目席代表奧斯汀也說，莫洛托夫的演說，具有　戰性質，似乎不合時宜；他說：「余不信盟國間之互相指摘能促進國際間的團結。』</p>
<p>貝爾納斯提出警吿</p>
<p>莫洛托夫的演說，在美國國內顯然也引起兩種不同的反應。一是反對派，可以前任商務部長華萊士爲代表，他說：「美蘇兩國如能坦白相處，各自裁减軍備，非不可能。』此在政府方面，貝爾納斯對於莫洛托夫的演說，深表不滿，他滿腹牢騷，但爲愛護美蘇兩國邦交起見，也就保守械默，未加評論，但是內心仍非常苦悶，因此他就借題發揮，警吿四國外長會議，他說：「四國外長會議對於德國問題，如若不能商得協議，則余將拒絕參加任何新的國際會議」</p>
<p>英美法蘇四國外長於本月四日如期開幕了，依照事前預算的議事日程，先將巴黎和會所完成的工作，加以審核與通過，對義，羅，匈，保，芬五國的和的草案，也可望在這幾天通過，經各國簽字後，即正式成立，四國外長會議至本月廿日之後，即開始討論德國問題。各方面對於討論德國間題，都已在準備之中了。</p>
<p>日韓問題不容忽視</p>
<p>四國外長會議，或將討論及盟國營制日本問題。而據美國調査團的報吿，日本財閥仍控制了龐大財富及經濟權力：工業組合。其潛勢力的存留不去，實在是遠東和平的一種威脅，同時其國內經濟情形，亦繼續改善，現正欲恢復其對外貿易，預料日本所製造的商品，又將泛濫於世界市塲了。明國管制日本的政策，實有重行加以檢討的必要。</p>
<p>朝鮮南部民主協會亦於本月二日向聯合國大呼籲，提出三項要求：（一）立即實施開羅及波茨坦宣言；（二）美蘇駐軍立即自朝鮮撤退；（三）准許朝鮮臨時政府加入聯合國機構爲會員國。並謂「將朝鮮劃分爲兩個佔領區，實爲對世界和平的一種直接威脅。」我們站在鄰國的立塲，深表同情，並盼望聯合國大會切勿置若岡聞，固爲朝鮮問題的如何解決，是不容我們忽視的。張逸人</p>
<h3>印回之爭</h3>
<p>— 張逸人</p>
<p>尼赫魯與真納</p>
<p>近月來印度各地印回衝突，日有所聞，臨時政府主席尼赫魯所乘的飛機前亦被人轟擊。當此印度面臨獨立之時而尙有國內印。回各敎派之箕豆相煎，腦筋古舊的人以爲印度暫時只配被治而不適治人，因爲「自由獨立」只引取更多的自相殘殺和暴動而已</p>
<p>我們亦決不能忽視當前印回紛爭之對於印度臨時政府的影響；尼赫魯不得不放慢他的脚步，每次行動，必得前看後顧。各重要城市的不寗大家對於眞納（回盟領袖）的印象要比尼赫魯爲劣，尼赫魯擁有較多的羣衆，尙能左右人心，而眞納一味無心加入政府停止衝突，這是他的弱點，尼氏以爲眞納的反抗政府事尙小，反對整個印度的獨立則事關大體。尼赫魯就拿眞納的這種意圖作爲對眞納反宣傳的工具。不過這亦非易事，眞納亦處處以英軍退出印度爲要挾的張本。尼氏旣以愛國者著稱，當然他亦不得不使英軍盡速退出印土。英軍一且撤退，尼氏在人民的眼光中自然更加偉大哩！從此在眞納看來，他可開始不惜用暴力擾亂尼赫魯的臨時政府，此時假如尼赫魯用他自己的軍隊出來壓制，則眞納又可藉口尼氏壓迫回敎從而退出政府。</p>
<p>此外尼赫魯的另一支柱是外國的援助，尼赫魯已得到國外的同情。所以尼氏現在對眞納的工作就是用盡方法使眞納的黨徒形成孤立，得不到外來的支援和同情。前次眞納想欲借助於蘇俄，尼赫魯知道了就在巴黎和會中向莫洛托夫「招手；」眞納想建立一自紅海至珊湖海之回盟國，尼氏爲此特地派了親善使節團至近東各國；諸如此類，尼氏的一貫政策欲使眞納處於孤立的狀態中，使他得不到國際的同情與帮助。</p>
<p>今日，不但三萬萬印度人民自己需要獨立，就是我們站在印度友人的立塲上亦需要印度自由。不過問題就在印度的獨立是否如眞納所望的回盟印度呢抑是尼氏的各敎派的印度呢？這個問題且待今後印回衝突的如何結束來解答吧！（節譯自密勒氏評論報）</p>
<p>新聞辭典</p>
<h3>印度國大黨</h3>
<p>— 佐祺</p>
<p>印度自十七世紀起即受東印度公司的經濟統制，而成爲英國的附庸，一八七六年英王兼印度皇帝，遂正式淪爲殖民地。直至最近始由印度國民大會黨前主席尼赫魯出而組織獨立的臨時政府</p>
<p>國民大會黨的前身—國民大會，成立於一八八五年，本是效忠於英駐印總督的組織，伹自一九一九年第一次世界大戰結束後，國民大會在聖雄甘地領導之下，對英勵行不合作的非武力抵抗運動，因此形成一個强有力的政黨，竟爲印度獨立運動的大本營了。</p>
<p>國大黨（國民大會黨的簡稱）的組織，自宗敎方面說，包含多數的印度敎徒與少數的回敎徒；自階級方面說，有王公，大地主，企業家，低賤階級及社會主義者，故黨員很多，數在五百萬以上。</p>
<p>國大黨要求統一的印度政府，回敎同盟（信奉回敎）則主張印回分治，故臨時政府成立之後兩敎人民衝突不已，最近回盟同意參加政府，豈已改組完成，雖衝突未停，諒可漸漸緩和，而精誠團結，爲新成立的獨立政府效勞。</p>
<h3>美國大選幕後</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特稿　　溪</p>
<p>美國三千五百萬以上的男女將於十一月五日全體出動，參加第八十屆全國大選，這次大選將決定明年一月間召集的第八十次國會的政治局面。第一屆的美國國會是一七八九年召集的。</p>
<p>自外平時代以降，美國的選舉人毫無間斷地遝用他們的投票權。他們每隔四年選舉一次大總統和副總統（政府的行政機構），每隔兩年決定國會（立法機構）的組織。今年的選舉通常稱爲國會議員選舉，因爲這次選舉只涉及國會議員的選舉，下决的總統選舉將於一九四八年十一月間舉行。</p>
<p>國會衆院議員的任期爲兩年。因此四十八州各國會選舉區內的選舉人將投票選出衆院全部議員共計四百三十五席。參院議員的任期是六年，每兩年選舉一次，每决只選出全體席數的三分之一。今年因有一部分死亡及辭職，選舉的名額略多於三分之一；即全體九十六席中的三十六席。緬因州根據其法律規定提前選舉，業已選出代表該州的一席，因此這回選舉應決定的參議員名額是三十五席。</p>
<p>每一州中，國會選舉區數目的規定，以其人口爲標準；人口最多的紐約州共有四十五區，同時在衆院中佔有同數的席决，人口最少的州只有一區或二區。每一州不論大小，得選舉參議員二人。</p>
<p>自從已故羅斯福總統領導下的「新政策」誕生以來十四年中，民主黨在參議院和衆議院中始終保持多數黨的地位。這一次的大選是　一九四四年當選副總統杜魯門於去年繼任大總統以來第一屆的國會議員選舉。</p>
<p>在美國的政治制度下，各黨　國會中的勢力難免有所消長，假如反對黨在國會中佔有優勢，或由民主黨多數的參議院與共和黨多數的衆議院混合組成，則杜魯門總統的任期可能就此吿終。上述第二種情形在歷史上數見不鮮。在過去五十年中，美國總統塔夫脫，威爾遜和胡佛在任期屆滿以前，反對黨均在衆院中佔有優勢，雖然他們在離職以前在參院中至少仍保特起碼的多數。</p>
<p>不管這一次選舉結果如何，美政府的行政首畏決無更迭，杜魯門總統將繼續在職，並能保留全體閣員和政府各行政部門的首長，但是到了一九四八年，總統職位就臨到存亡關頭。因此在目前的大選中，値得注意的問題是選出怎麽樣的參議員和衆議員。選舉的趨向是民意的反映，此等民意將由各黨鎭袖和一九四八年總統競選者加以仔細的硏究。</p>
<p>換口味</p>
<p>過去數星期中，對於此次大選結果的預測成爲政論家和報章主筆的主要課題。但此項預測因有下列原因，頗非易易：這次選舉是戰後美國第一屆普選，如果歷史重演的話，投票人或許有「換換口味」的意向；一黨佔多數經過相當長久時期以後，會發生循環性的變動；，房屋糧食及物資的缺乏；工資，物價及生活費動盪不定；返國退伍軍人一千二百萬至一千三百萬人的政治趨向難以斷定，其中靑年份子尙屬初次投票</p>
<p>民主黨及共和黨候選人對於國內問題　的意見雖不一致，但對於美十國外交政策並無。顯著的爭議。新聞記者遊歷各地以後，發表他們的意見，大致無甚軒輊，可以基督敎科學指導報華盛頓分社主任德魯蒙的言論爲代表，他說；「在我所遊歷過的各州中，從未遇到一個民主黨或共和黨的國會議員候選人對於美國的外交政策提出過任何異議」。</p>
<p>在國會議員選舉中，尤其在衆一哦員區域選舉中，地方問題佔有重要地位，除投票選舉政府候選人外，尙須選舉公職二百餘萬席，包括市政官吏，法官，公立學校董事，及半數以上的州長。因此在多數州中，黨團體及黨員的實力足以決定民主黨抑共和黨在民意方面佔有優勢。</p>

<h3>文藝作品中的比喻</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>比喩，在各種不同的領域中，它都占有著相當重要的地位。一個說書匠藉它的魔力去抓緊聽衆，當他形容一個美女的時候，口裏會吐出「杏核眼，柳葉眉，糯米銀牙，楊柳腰」，末了來上一句「眞像天女落了几」。一般大衆，甚至向來被士大夫所不齒的所謂「販夫走卒」，也都會使用比喩的武器於各樣塲合之中，長的頭大一點，便有人叫你「大頭鬼」，舌頭長，那，「吊死鬼的混名你便扔不掉，臉上表情冷了一點，別人會駡你「好似誰欠了你二百錢」，諸如此類，眞是屈指不盡。我們駡日本軍閥像瘋狗一樣，斯太林在大會塲上把蘇聯比做菜園，把侵略的野心家比做猪。</p>
<p>就是在語言的勢力圍外，它依然活動着，作用着。左右手的食拇指那麼凑一個圓糊，便會叫人明暸它們所代表的東一西，把手向頭頂上一比量，一個深淺或高低的意義便含在當中，對一個聲子講話你可以用手勢，總之，這「不言而喩」的傳述，全賴「比」在中間做牽綫　。</p>
<p>現在，我們把它局限在文藝的園子裏來談談。</p>
<p>隨便打開一部文藝作品，詩歌也罷，散文也罷，小說也罷「比喻」會紛然的用顏色來惹人的眼，用聲音來逗人的耳朶，用別的不同的姿態來撩起人的感覺，我常想，如果把它從文藝田園中，驅逐出去，那，文藝會變成個什麽樣子，是不堪想像的。這樣，我們一定要追求，何物「比喻』，竟有如此的魔力？其實，這個疑問，很容易回答，它的本身已把它的滴意高標出來了，如果，非照例要求一個「定義」不可的話，那也簡單，「以彼物比此物也」，一句老話拉過來不就得嗎？</p>
<p>比喩，本是修辭學上的一格，從文藝表現的技術上他取得了很高的地位，把文藝的老祖宗—詩經打開，在每一章詩的注脚上，你會碰到「賦也」「比也」「興也」這樣的字眼。一部詩經的表現手法，都被納入這三個範疇。現在，我們先來硏究一下它在文藝中怎樣被應用着，然後再觸到他的作用及其他。</p>
<p>「手如柔荑，膚如凝脂，「如花似玉」，把一個女子的美麗送到了我們的限前。「大絃嘈嘈如急雨，小絃切切如私語」「嚦嚦鶯聲花外囀」，音樂的淸音，美人的嬌語，在我們的耳中響動，「所餐類病馬，動影似移嶽」，這是一個病人的自畫像，讀了「落花猶似隊樓人」時，一個絕代美人的慘死，會在人心上喚起憐惜之情。「茫茫來日愁如海」「恰似一江春水向東流」，給讀者畫出了愁的深度和量數。形容人生之疾速的，在中國有「光陰似箭，日月如梭」的比喩，在西洋也有「來如流水逝如風」（I　Come　Like　Water，Like　Wind　I　go）的說法。「艷如桃李，冷若冰霜」，寫出一個可望而不可即的仙人。這類的例子如果引下去，眞能一氣寫乾一瓶墨汁。凡此「如，似，類，猶似，若……」都是比喩的符號。用現代語來說，那就是「一樣，一般的，好像，彷彿……等等。但有一點，須在這裏指明，帶有這些字樣的不一定與比喻有關，譬如說「如其是，若然，彷彿是這樣……」相反的，有的不穿這樣的外衣，而它的本體還是比喩，「妾心古井水」「初八月半鏡上淸大」，有無數的例證給我們看</p>
<p>爲什麽比喩有那麼火的魔力，看了以上的例子也可以從中抽繹出一點通理來了。你只說「時光跑得眞快呀！直快呀！」就是迎疊一萬個「眞快呀」，還是不能够給人以快的感覺。你說一個美人「眞漂亮死了」，讀者不會從「漂亮死了」四個空洞的字眼裏看出一個美人來。原由就是你只在抽象的吶喊，而沒有把一個具體的形象放在人的眼前。如果你說「父母之愛，海一樣的深」，便不會落到魯迅先生」：父母之愛呵，呵唷，呵唷，我說不出」的諷刺中了。說到這裘，我們該明白比喩的意義與價値了。它能給人以活生生的印象，目可視，耳可聞，手可觸，鼻可嗅。有了它，文藝的姿態才生動，色彩才鮮明，好似綠葉扶映了紅花，錦繡上添了燦爛的花朶。</p>
<p>一個比喩，並不是「招之即來」那麼容易，反之，它是「千呼萬噢始出來」的。人間每一件具體或抽象的事物及觀念，都可以作另一件的比喩。你呼你的愛人：「我的月亮」，（My　Moom）但你也可以反過來說「月亮好像美人的險」。「芙蓉如面柳如眉」，你也可以把你比喩倒轉過來應用。形容一件東西，一個觀念，可以有無數的近似的比擬，你有權利把一輪滿月比做美人面，但你也可以把它比做一個玉盤，你可以把有價値的死比做泰山，無價値的比做鴻毛，但你也可以把它們比做別的。但是，可比的雖多，而恰當，美滿的却只有少數，甚至一個。誰能够抓到這最恰當的少數或是那一個，誰便算成功。好似打靶一樣，從外向內，一環的直到那個「的」射中環的多少，可以表示一個射手本領的高低，一得中「的」才是聖手。</p>
<p>怎樣去引取比喩呢？這是一個不很簡單的問題，我們應當先從比喩的產生下手。自然界，人事界的一切現象，由於感覺的作用造成了不同的形象，而此形象，又往往伴情感以俱來，看見高山，自會起莊嚴之想，看過「澄江靜如練」，淡泊寗靜之念以生。但同時我們還應該分析每一個形象的本體及其屬性，譬如說月亮，她是一個星球，她有圓缺不同的形象，她有幽明時變的光輝…，我們只有了這單方面的知識還不够，必須再將需要引喻的那個本體也照樣的剖解一下，兩方面都弄個淸楚，然後把你所用的部分取來，「月如鈎」，用的是上弦或下眩月的形狀，「半鏡上靑天」，「面如滿月」自然又不同，「相思如滿月，夜夜减淸輝」，用的不是她的形狀而是她的光輝了。「出如脫兎」，如果不是取其善走之意，而說人像兎子，那成什麽話呢？</p>
<p>同一比喩，要酌量容觀的情形而應用。奏哀樂的時候，那可以用「如怨如慕如泣如訴」的句子，在人家結婚奏樂的塲合上你拿這作比，會成了笑話。「劍外忽傳收蘇北，初聞涕淚沾衣裳」，如果把歡歡喜的眼淚比做悲哀的源泉，那只顯出你的無知。一個盲人可以羿出「捫盤扣燭」的笑話來，而一個有視覺的人硬把張三的帽子往李四的頭上按，那眞成了笑話的笑話。　比喩只求其近似，而不能彼此完全一絲不爽，拿一個照片去對照那個人，不能說這「像」你，應該說道「是」你了。比喩的妙處，比喩的效力，全在這擬似之問。這裏邊含著誇大性，使讀者得到更淸楚，更活潑，更凸出的一個印象，而增加了文藝的感染力。愛一個人，你說「愛她比海還深」，讀者不會嫌你誇大，只覺你愛的深厚，「領如蝤蠐，螓首蛾眉」，我們讀了這兩句詩，只覺得比的好，決不會駡作者把一些可怕的蟲子來比美人。</p>
<p>有時你會覺得，有些比喩好似「擬於不倫」，『　太陽像一座播音機安放在天上」，「模糊的一片悲哀，無聲的雨點打來」，猛然一入目，彷彿不合理，一經評味，便覺得要得了。記得雪萊也曾拿聲音與顏色相比。但這並不是隨便可以取譬，必須經過分析，比較，而取其相近的一點。一個比喩的獲得是經過了一個長的過程，說「創造比喩」也無不可　在比喩的應用上決不可以太累贅，一來就是一大串像晚唐溫李那樣，只不過藉它去掩飾他們內容的空虛，比喩不僅僅作爲一個點綴而存在，它常滿含情感附着到一個本體上去，「芙蓉如面柳如眉」觸目傷心，「對此如何」「不」伴着迫憶而「淚垂」呢。　爲了免得太板，用此喩也不必把，「好像，一樣，一般……等等的字眼弄得滿紙都是，可以換一換手法，使有比喩之實而無比喩之貌。「朝爲斷陽花，暮逐東流水」人生無常的觀念，借了比喻活躍到紙上來。試再舉例：</p>
<p>（一）幽谷勢龍帶起來一串沈雷—這大砲的響聲。</p>
<p>（二）看見過嗎，夜裏把住鷄　捉鷄，</p>
<p>他們被捉來就是一樣。　有許多方式可以把比喻放上，應用的靈活與死板，全看手法的高低了。</p>
<p>陳腐的比喩，我們要毫不留情拋棄的它。「如花美眷，似水流年」，這比喩的創造者是個天才，可惜它的生命已被一些庸才的手折磨死了，現在，再拿這骸骨一當法寳，那眞成了奴才了。「光陰如白駒過隙」已喚不起新鮮的印象，換一換字眼說「時光快過馬」，就覺得有些新的氣息了。陳腐的比喩也能給人以新的感覺，那須得在它被安放在合適地位這一點上。譬如，「夢一般」這個比喻，一看就有點呌人生厭，因爲看厭了「人生如夢」以及類似這樣句子的緣故，但是寫成：「雪花夢一般的繽紛」的一句詩，你讀了，也許還想再讀第二遍。「化腐臭爲神奇」，不是容易的事。看見蝴蝶呼妹妹，望見月亮喊姐姐，把比喻的身價弄得太下賤了的人，這篇小文對他也許有一點用處。</p>
<h3>蜀中煙雲　（油　）</h3>
<p>— 關良</p>
<h3>屠格湼夫與女人</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>俄國小說家屠格湼夫（趣一事Ivan　Sergeyevitch　Turgeniev　1818—1883），他一生雖然都過獨身的生活，但是他總是少不了女人的，一八四一年（年三十三歲）他初次從德國回蘇聯，就和他家裏一個農奴的女兒戀愛，後來，這農奴的女兒和另一個蘇聯官吏結了婚，屠格湼夫非常惱怒。到晚年時，他又與一個叫做費雅度夫人的發生了愛情，兩人相處得也蠻好，他每一部作品寫完後，都要先給她看看。有一次，他的名著「烟」完成時，恰巧她到柏林去了，於是他覺得非常難過，終日的悶悶不樂。</p>
<h3>藝術與科學</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>所謂藝術是一個抽象的名字，要是替它下一個註脚的話，我們可以這麼說：凡以『表現」而達到其「目的」的，其表現似乎與實際無用，而與物質尤其其無用的稱爲藝術。</p>
<p>因此，藝術與科學成爲極端的二個部門，因爲科學是走向實際的，有所發現而利於人生的。因之，科學才是眞理的論調就產生了。關於這種獨斷論自有値得考慮的餘地，不，應該拋掉它，因爲它抹殺了藝術的功用。科學是要經過無機，有機，心理，生理而達到所謂人生現象，這是不可能的，我們給與否認。</p>
<p>科學的觀念只在一個『知』字—一個抽象觀念。科學家藉此推動時代前進，人類得以進步，世界方能改造。不過，科學有許多缺點：比方說，科學昌明有原子彈的發明，就原子彈的本身就是無辜的，但人類藉此威脅世界和平；維持世界和平。因此有人把原子彈之發明而影響世界和平完全歸咎於知識。道正如政治家賣國求榮是一樣的。</p>
<p>這原因實在是知識有不可靠的槪念來肯定它的「觀念」的緣故。而藝術往往可以避免這缺點的，不過也不能絕對的說，我曾經聽到人說，「美』足以引起慾望，而不能滿足一個人的自私。這，我們沒有話可說，他是美之姦賊！</p>
<p>同樣的，看到圖畫中的美人就會心動，這是觀者不道德的觀念存在着之故。藝術是只能旁觀的，以不引起慾望的才能稱眞正的藝術！</p>
<p>因此，藝術是　難的，是不朽的，藝術有無數的眞理。說得開一點，藝術應該『放之四海而皆準，百世以俟聖人而不惑。』</p>
<h3>露</h3>
<p>— 蔣敦</p>
<p>愛黎明的人，總是喜歡露珠的。</p>
<p>當黑夜逝去，朝霞染紅了東方的時候，在蘇醒的園林裏，在花苞上，在葉尖上，便掛着晶瑩淸新的露珠，像少女眼中點點的淚光！是歡欣，也含着無盡的哀愁……</p>
<p>愛黎明的人，常有着朝露般的心情，在宇宙的大海裏，人渺小的像一滴露，晨露渴望着朝陽的愛撫，而又溶化在朝陽的懷抱中，消失了自己的一切。像一切追求着陽陽光的人，當着黎明到來了。已供獻了自己整個的生命！</p>
<p>露珠是在黑夜的寒冷中生成的，讓溫暖的陽光將它帶走，露珠滋潤着一切向陽光的花和葉！露珠是黎明的啓示。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　84</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>剛過去沒幾步，忽然聽得那傢伙，扯開那沙拉拉的嗓子，打起我們的鄉音唱了起來：</p>
<p>一十八歲的姑娘喲，把那綉房來進啊—</p>
<p>進了綉房喲，顚不倒的想起了心上的人呀——</p>
<p>心上人兒喲，人在天邊外哩——</p>
<p>人在天邊外喲，哪不想碎了奴家俺的心啊！——　」……</p>
<p>這傢伙愈唱，聲音愈小，人也走得愈遠了。從這唱的字音上，可以斷定這傢伙，準是一個日本鬼子，必是在東北待過不少時候；要不，就是咱們這裏的大國民給敎的這種俚歌。虧他學得很像，可惜就是每句脫不了一個日本的尾普「　」字，正像故事裏的狐狸精，雖然修成人形，只是沒把尾巴弄掉。</p>
<p>虎第一聽這家伙唱，幾次要笑出來，同時又有些惱意；我也覺得有些忍俊不禁。這一來倒似乎把我們緊張的情緒，完全弄得鬆馳了，精神也畏了起來。趁那探照燈光還沒掃射過來的常口，我便把脚拳了起來，因爲伸直的時間渦久，有此僵得痠了。誰知這一拳，才發見這大腿以下，簡直重了幾倍，並且浸濕之後，未會活動，以致有些麻木。那一雙脚，更是重得拉不過來，穿的這雙皮鞋，被汚泥完全裏住，圓滾滾一團，很像兩隻新上泥的皮蛋。</p>
<p>我們一壁整理鞋襪，一壁悄聲說話。我把探照燈光的道理，吿訴虎弟，省得他着急，又吿訴他，最好等燈光乍過，就動手越牆，最爲妥當，時間上可以從容不迫。</p>
<p>我們整理好了，又休息了一會，各人從小袋內，摸着捐出了一點東西吃過了，這才準備越牆。燈光在我們休息的時候，已經又轉過了三四次了，每决時間很準，所以我們也不用多担心事了。</p>
<p>這石牆大槪有六七尺高，而且上面舖得平整。等到燈光一過，一聲暗號，虎弟把手搭在牆頭，輕輕一聳，像狸猫那樣輕捷，人已經上了牆頭，伏爬躺在那裏，給了我一個平安的手式。我看了這手式，也立即聳身上牆，也同虎弟一樣平伏臥在牆頭上。我剛攏住眼光向牆裏四下打量着，虎弟已順着牆壁溜了下去，兩步一滑，像一道黑影似的，路過一條一丈開外的路面，鑽到路那邊一帶帶樹裏去了。</p>
<p>這牆有一尺多厚，完全山石砌成，牆頭舖得很平，牆裏根脚下，有二尺冬寬一尺多高的熱脚；這大槪是預備人站在上面，正合普通身量高度，便於對外射擊。下了墊脚，就是一條整齊的大路，可容兩部大軍用卡車並行，綽綽有餘。大路的邊上，沿路栽着七八尺高，十分整齊的一帶叢樹，有三四尺厚光景。在這夜色曚曚之下，兩頭一望，這條天路，簡直看不到頭。業林以外，不見建築，想必是一個一望無垠的廣塲。</p>

<p>這是個敎訓，拆息這樣的高，誰願花錢來和人鬧糾紛，增麻煩，眞是吃飽了飯沒事做了！所以，這一次雖然刋載煌煌的大幅公開標售卅九單位敵僞房地產的廣告，恐怕也很少有人問津，因爲眞有錢的朋友，上海有的是件等各樣的房地產，何必自討苦吃，找頭痛里！</p>
<p>沒有人買，信託局是不負責任的，再交處理局來辦，而處理局一年多以來，處理這些千頭萬緒的敵僞產業，確乎十分稱職，勞苦功高，然而它是一個臨時機關，短期內就要結束的，又怎能留下一件懸案來呢？而勒令原住戶先行遷讓，於情於理，又都說不過去，况且康　脫路一機關就是前鑒。怎麼辦？傷腦筋呀</p>
<p>又何必傷腦筋呢？取之於民，用之於民，當局的主旨不過在收回法幣，但左手標賣，右手又撥款誇建市民住宅，眞是令人啼笑皆非，其實，兩件事原可併成一件辦的。假使信託局是業主，不是可以向房客收取一筆押租？不是可以向房客收取一筆房租？這個數目相加起來，與標賣的底價又何致於相差太遠呢？這一算盤，不妨撥撥看看，兩個負責機關是不是可以據情上陳呢？</p>
<p>一封來信</p>
<h3>垃圾遍上海</h3>
<p>— 金衣水</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個公務員，就我所知所見，對上海市容，不能無言。現在要說的：（一）本市中心區交通要道，四川路橋畔東南首現闢爲汽車停車場，（以前是工部局所闢華人公園）爲若干難民所佔據，汚穢狼籍，橋堍糞便堆積，已有月餘，臭氣冲天。此處每日巾外行人經過者不知數萬人，莫不掩鼻而過。</p>
<p>我當然是每天經過的人，每日容忍總想有人出而攻擊本市當局，然而容忍月餘，現狀仍然如故；故而就公民一員之責任，百忙之餘，深夜握管，必表而出之；便此丟盡中國臉面之恶現象，早日掃凈，方爲快事！在橋堍糞汚堆樍處有一電桿木上裝警察局專用電話，每日看見有警察掩鼻在打電話，如果該打電話的警察，將該汚臭情形呈報其上級，或由上級再呈報主管淸潔事務人員加以淸除，原爲極簡單之事，然而一月以來未見淸除。我眞疑心市府的工務局·衛生局·社會局·警察局一切外勤人員，難道沒有一個人經過四川路橋的嗎？假使有一個人把這事報告上去，那上級人員就應該立即工作。如果局長市長以及其他各長平日沒得人員報吿，明明是他的部下不盡職。部下不盡職就是上級的督促不勤不嚴。照此推論，每一件本市不良事件其負責的人員不難逐步推追，使其不能逃避責任。這不過上級人員在組織上及督導上稍下一些工夫就可以達到目的。所以我在憤恨時，我要恨市長御下無方，局長科長亦都不能卸責。如四川路橋堍難民盤據停車塲，使原來疎散路上的汽車仍舊停於路上，假使說允許難民居住，難道上海之大必須呌此等難民陳列於衆目昭彰的中區嗎？難民要予教濟，則予以救濟，不能救濟，立即　逐，事甚簡單。然而社會局所司何事？公用局造停車塲何用？我始終恨市政府各局不管事？更恨市民們不起來檢舉比等此徵小事，差幾個淸潔夫就可以解決淸除糞汚的事，都辦不了。</p>
<p>還有，在四川路南京路北首惠羅公司對面人行道下有二個大水潭已有數月之久。我每日經過的時候，都要提心弔阻防備局長市長汽車經過時汚水滿濺各處，路人經過時多少被濺圓數點汚水。但從未見有人去修理，此外在一　　　　（　　寺　　）東首人行這上積存許多路上獨起的柏油碎塊，因爲日子久了，行人長久一踐踏的結果已生了根了。我就怨恨工務局爲什麽不設法早日除去？此一工作亦很輕便。還有工務局在修路時預先在人行道上積存小石子沙粒等，每每積存十天半月，方才動工，使行路人行走不便，甚至選行馬路山致肇車輛傷書行人之事。其實工務局要舉辦修路當日車料前去，完工之後立即車淸。</p>
<p>編者先生對市政不良現狀坦自攻擊，此種攻擊是促使市政進步使市長多聽民意，決不是惡意。我並不是小題大做，我是爲了要上海進步要市府深得民心，所以我這樣說。</p>
<h3>司機肇事禍就地槍決</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>本月三日大錫報載：無錫縣政府汽車遊　梅園返城時，因行車過速，撞倒軍官總隊學員荆士　，傷重殞命。附近軍官官隊員目睹慘悄，　起憤慨，將坐車的縣府秘書，連同司機及助手，帶往隊部，並呈報上峯請示。結果。司機朱林寶，在肇事原處執行槍決，秘書及司機助手，被押地方法院候訊。</p>
<p>這一則新聞，若和近來上海吉普傷人的事情相一比，人命的貴賤，就有天壤之別了。我知道有一般向來懾於市虎之威的市民，一定看了會拍案稱快的。</p>
<p>但是，就實際說，那司機因駕車不愼，過失殺人，而遽遭槍決，道究竟是毁滅司法而又滑稽可恨的事！</p>
<p>該報上又說：「該學員八年抗戰，鋒鏑餘生，竟罹此祕，「而道正是司機之命不得不斷送的理由，司機眞倒霉，假如撞死了一個鄕下老太婆或是一個挑販就多好？</p>
<p>並且，値得注意的，被撞死的是一位武人，假使駕車的是一位武人呢？上海人恐怕又要皺起眉來了！</p>
<p>心理衛生</p>
<h3>兩種疲勞</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>在工作過久之後，誰都會感覺疲勞的。休息目的是爲恢復疲勞，睡眠是最好的休息。誰都是這樣地想。可是事實並不如此簡單，一夜的睡眠，身體上的疲勞是恢復了，但精神上的疲勞不一定會解除。</p>
<p>勞心勞力</p>
<p>一個勞力的人，白晝的工作無論何等繁重，經一夜休息之後，體力已可完全恢復了。勞心的人，睡眠後醒來，腦力也覺得淸醒些。因爲不論勞心或勞力的人，在工作的時候，體力上增加消耗，在休息的時候，體力的消耗减少，而新生的增長，却比所消耗的多，所以身體上的疲勞是容易恢復的。所謂精神上的疲勞，是指心理上對於工作發生厭倦的解釋。</p>
<p>一個人在工作的時候，神經必定極度緊張，這個在心理衛生上說是很不宜的。在神經緊張的工作，稍久會覺得單調乏味，道就是造成疲勞的原因。愈是簡單而機械的工作，雖然在心力上體力上都較爲輕便，但愈是容易感到工作單調。更換工作是調劑精神及避免因單調面對工作發生厭倦的普通方法。</p>
<p>緊張鬆驰</p>
<p>學校裏的課程表，就是在變化和調劑的原則下產生的。假使工作一時不能更換，那麼能够使緊張的神經鬆弛片刻，也很快會恢復，因爲這並不是眞正的疲勞。好比在工作時，吸一枝烟，喝一杯茶，都無非把神經暫時鬆弛一下。</p>
<p>情緒是促成疲勞的因素。在神經緊張的時候，往往會產生過慮，遲疑，自卑等感覺，使情緒不穩定，以致造成心理變態的現象。希望工作完成而思慮，發生擾亂使工作不能順利進行而發怒，這是很普通的情形。情緒不安或甚至爆發，人的原因比物的原因更多。對於某甲不滿而牽涉到某甲的工作，自已的工作一若和他有關的，也會覺得厭項。這是一個管理的人所不司忽視的。</p>
<p>興趣是可以减少精神疲勞的。一個能力很低的人，担任一種很重的工作，不但力不勝任，心理上也覺得非常痛苦。相反的大才小用，也是使工作的人發生厭倦。這都能使人對工作毫無興趣的緣故。所以一個善於管理的人，能把工作文配得很好，不僅各人可發揮他的才能。同是可以使工作的人，發生很大興趣，促進工作效率的增加。興趣實爲推進工作的原動力。興趣雖和才能有關，但一半是靠　培養出來的。成功會使人發生興趣，獎勵也可以增加興趣，工作的方式，工作的環境，間接也和興趣有關。</p>
<p>工作的環境，和疲倦成反比例。環境愈完美，愈使人精神煥發，而不會疲勞。所謂完美，並不是要像咖啡館跳舞塲一樣，要有彈簧沙法的座椅，動人的音樂。但在光綫，空氣，淄度以及桌椅等等，都須注意，使工作的人覺得非常舒適而愉快，因爲好的一精神，是基於好的身體的。</p>
<p>普通的疲勞，並非眞正體力腦力不繼，而是精神上範罩着一　陰影所致，可以很容易很迅速在他恢復過來。這不是幻術，而是對症下藥，所謂「心病還須心藥醫」。</p>
<h3>訂婚戒</h3>
<p>— 乾</p>
<p>在華盛頓，有人淸早駕汽車出游，看見在街燈下站着一位少女，全身赤裸，手指上却還戴着一只訂婚戒。據她說，因爲她拒絕把訂婚戒還給男朋友，所以他便把她通身衣服全都剝光了。（譯十月廿九日大陸報）</p>
<h3>倮倮同胞的社會</h3>
<p>— 方浩敎授講　馬慧心節錄</p>
<p>地方安謐，夜不閉戶。</p>
<p>今夏，復旦大學渝校敎授方浩先生等復員抵滬，在江灣復旦大學演講，講題爲「西南采風」。關於倮倮部份，頗有價値，爰特錄奉自由談：</p>
<p>「爲了要考察倮倮族人的生活風俗，所以就跑到離開昆明數百里外的倮倮人的村莊裏去。考察者基木具備的條件，是要有强健的體格。須能騎馬，能爬山，有時還須帶了舌人去做　譯。</p>
<p>倮倮人稱漢人爲「客家」；他們自己不願客家稱他們爲倮倮，他們自認是「中國人」。這是團結的象徵。</p>
<p>行襄不必上鎖也們不會偷竊</p>
<p>舌人吿訴客家，行旅到他們的村莊中去，行囊箱篋不可上鎖；因爲他們的自尊心很强，上了鎖的東西，他們認爲客家怕他們偸。這是不友好不信任的表示。他們以爲是很羞辱的。可是，他們的好奇心却也很强，喜歡看看客家的衣衫等物。一個倮倮族女子向客家要了一件男人穿的襯衫，她根木就不知道是男人的衣裳。要是有些東西。你不願給他們，他們也不強要。</p>
<p>晚上倮倮人待客，他們認　爲最客氣的待客之禮是派了二個女子來陪客，當你入睡時，問茶問水，恃候週到；否則，他們認爲失敬之至。此種女子，名爲「活枕」，她們謙恭得很，一直不走。這倒難爲了考察的人，祗得呌了舌人來，傳達意思，請她們走了。起先，考察者不知究竟，經舌人吿知後，才知上述原委。現在，這種風氣已漸漸地經西南各地去考察的敎授家等敎誨薰陶之後，而趨於滅了地方上也很安謐，沒有盜賊，居民可以夜不閉戶。這是我們所處環境中所及不到的。倮倮同胞的地方，沒有窮人。沒工作的人，人家都願意恰你工作，供給衣食。</p>
<p>還有、他們的房屋的門戶，總不與對面人家的門戶柑對，所以，各人家的門戶總是偏向而設的；他們也不干涉別人家的閒事，因此，也沒有甚麽是非了。</p>
<p>有一次，倮倮人帶考察者至一處地方。祇是三面有　的一塊空地，一無陳設，使人　　覺奇怪，經倮倮人吿知，原來是倮倮靑年男女談情說愛的地方。他們間的戀愛却也很自由。</p>
<p>倮倮人很敬神，在一處深林中，四面圍了繩子，繩子上還繫着羊角。他們親定在道地方，女人是不准進去的。那祭神的東西是一塊黑色的石頭，在地下挖了洞，藏在其中，每年冬至日掏出，殺羊沾血，用以祭神。</p>
<p>一個奇異風俗墓上另置小棺</p>
<p>他們還有一樁奇異的風俗，是當人死了埋葬之後，還另外做一具長的數寸的小棺材外面寫死者的姓名及生卒年月等，中儲竹片。死者若是男子，則在竹片上繫以鬚髮。此種小棺材藏匿於峻嶺峭壁之岩穴間，很整齊地排列着。這種東西，他們認爲很神聖的，外人不得轉易到此，考察者於夜深人靜的月明之夜悄悄地經舌人伴往，冒險　挽峭壁而上。我，（方氏自稱）爲了學術上硏究的綠故，所以，也就藏了一具在袋內，帶了回來。</p>
<p>倮倮人也很　國抗戰時據說有一次統計，某處的八十多個倮倮，捐出了八千滇票，一千法幣，在當時情形看來，他們的財力已是很富裕的了。他們的視力不差，能騎馬射槍。據說台兒莊勝利之役，有很多倮倮人曾經參與此抗敵。</p>
<p>在一所瑞人辦的學校中，敎拉丁女，考試的結果，傑倮族學生居第一名。由此也可是很也是很聰明的。」</p>

<h3>Both Sides Accept Mediator's Opinion, Hopeful for Resumption of Peace Talks, Government and Political Consultative Conference Representatives Visit Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] It is reported that the situation of the peace talks has gradually become concrete on the 5th. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can accept the mediator's new plan to reopen the peace talks. However, although Zhou Enlai gave a detailed explanation on military and political points after meeting with the people of the Democratic League on the 5th, it was still considered too broad. The government hopes to simplify the problem and solve the more important and urgent ones first. As for the opinions put forward by the Democratic League and others, although the issue of the National Assembly has been mentioned, there is no definite suggestion on the postponement. The government representatives stated that the National Assembly would not be postponed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Representatives of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social dignitaries have agreed to the new plan for peace talks on the 5th. It is reported that the content only focuses on the resumption of negotiations, and the form of the meeting is still to be finalized. Some people believe that it is too early to say that a comprehensive meeting will be held on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Zhang Junmai visited Shao Lizi in the morning of the 5th, then visited the American Ambassador, reiterated the mediator's opinion, and attended a meeting held at the Bank of Communications at 10 o'clock. Zhou Enlai was also invited to attend and reported on the contacts with the US and the government since the ceasefire in June, as well as the Communist Party's opinions on the peace talk process, listing the key points of the troop deployment in great detail. In the afternoon at 4 o'clock, government representatives Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, and Lei Zhen gathered at Wu Tiecheng's residence. At the same time, Miao Jiaming, Mo Dehui, Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, and Luo Longji also attended. Zhang Junmai and others reported on the Communist Party's opinions and put forward more concrete opinions. Then, government and Political Consultative Conference representatives visited the Chairman at 5 o'clock to report everything. The Chairman immediately expressed that the government sincerely seeks peace and agrees to reopen the peace talks, but the process and form of the peace talks are still to be studied. It is understood that government representatives will meet again at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th to discuss further, and meet with the people of the Democratic League at 5 o'clock to report the government's attitude. In summary, it seems that there is hope for the opening of peace talks, but it is still difficult to determine how to start it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Communist Party member Wang Bingnan visited the American Ambassador in the morning of the 5th. Fu Jingbo visited Song Ziwen at about 11 o'clock. In the afternoon at 1 o'clock, the American Ambassador and Fu Jingbo went to Peng Xuepei's banquet, accompanied by Shao Lizi, Zhang Wansheng, Wu Tiecheng, and others, and returned at 3 o'clock.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Zhang Bojun arrived in Nanjing on the 5th and took the night train to Shanghai again. Liang Shuming is scheduled to go to Beiping on the 6th.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 National Assembly Representatives Have Registered, President Song and Others Went to Complete the Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] On the fourth day of registration for the National Assembly representatives, a total of 74 people registered, bringing the total to 483. Mongolian representative Dawa also went to register. Xu Tingyao, Chen Ce, Zang Qifang, Qin Dechun, Liang Hancao, Kong Geng and others have all registered. Song Ziwen and Xue Yue also sent representatives to complete the procedures. Today, most of the representatives who arrived from afar were from Tianjin and Fujian. They were moved into the guest house separately. Currently, 83 people live in the first guest house, 40 people live in the second guest house, and no one has moved into the remaining three guest houses. However, the arrangement work is extremely busy. The reporter visited the guest house. The internal facilities include the China Cultural Service Agency, which is convenient for representatives to buy books, newspapers, and stationery; a temporary post office, a library (arranged by the Central Library), a supply department, which is operated by a cooperative for laundry work; and a telecommunications bureau, which solves the difficulty of long-distance calls. The restaurant is operated by the Nanjing Catering Industry Association, which entrusts a representative office to handle matters such as sending letters, remittances, and purchasing train tickets on behalf of the representatives. A total of 32 staff members in the five guest houses can cope with all affairs. In addition, there are transportation vehicles for representatives to go out. There are six routes in the city from 7 o'clock, with one bus every hour. In case of special events, application can be made for temporary use. The staff are very humble. If the representatives feel dissatisfied, they can fill in the "Representatives' Opinions on Reception" and send it to the preparatory committee for improvement. In addition, the police department transferred the Chinese military police stationed in Japan to guard the post. Anyone without a pass is not allowed to enter. For a time, reporters were rejected outside the door. It was then decided that those with official agency badges could enter, so that they could be interviewed. In addition, the conference has made proper arrangements for the problem of vehicle congestion during the meeting, so that 400 vehicles can be evacuated within 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Procedural Group Officially Established Today</h3>

<h3>National Assembly Representatives from Various Places Arrive in Shanghai and Nanjing One After Another</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] It was recently learned from the Shanghai Reception Station of the National Assembly that in the past two days, representatives who passed through Shanghai to Nanjing included Ma Xingye (specially selected by the Central Government), Luo Yiqun (specially selected by the Central Government), Qin Baoheng (Henan), Liu Zhidang (Jiangsu), Qiu Zhimai (freelancer), Huang Yishen (Guangdong), Mai Xingfu (Guangdong), Yun Shicheng (Zhonghe Party), Xi Jiang (Zhonghe Party), Deng Dingyuan (Guangdong), Wu Jianxiong (Guangdong), Yu Mingyang (Guangdong), Huang Hangpu (Guangdong), Zhong Zhenhua (Guangdong), Yu Jiexian (Guangdong), Chen Xifang (freelancer), Chen Bai (freelancer), He Kuiquan (overseas Chinese in Africa), and Liu Guozeng (Liaobei). In total, from the 29th of last month to the 5th, 79 representatives arrived in Shanghai, and 56 of them have successively proceeded to Nanjing. The remaining 23 are also waiting for transportation to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhang Kailian, Secretary-General of the Fujian Provincial Government, Li Yilizhou, Director of the Department of Education, and Guo Gongmu, President of Fujian College, flew to Shanghai from Fujian on the 5th. Zhang, Li, and Guo are all National Assembly representatives and will soon transfer to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly. [Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Fujian National Assembly representatives Zhang Fubin, Zhan Tiaoyuan, Yang Fengnian, Lin Xueyuan, and Shi Lei arrived in Nanjing on the 5th to register.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Yang Sen, Chairman of Guizhou, arrived in Nanjing from Guiyang on the 5th and will register for the National Assembly in the next few days.</p>
<p>Also, the Central News Agency broadcast on the 1st that the list of regional representatives of the nine northeastern provinces of the National Assembly omitted Hejiang Province. The following is a correction: List of regional representatives of Hejiang Province: Xu Jingqing, Nian Minglun.</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Office, 5th Dispatch] The National Assembly representatives of the indigenous people in the southwest border area, which have been approved by the Legislative Yuan, are ten, and the three representatives of Yunnan, Lu Guofan, Yang Dizhong, and Zhang Chong, are regularly elected.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 5th Dispatch] Speaker Hu Ziyang of the Municipal Council flew to Nanjing on the 5th to attend the National Assembly. In addition, several National Assembly representatives from this city, such as Zhang Mianou and Tang Zhiqin, plan to fly to Nanjing on the 6th. Lai Jianlin and Sichuan National Assembly representative Li Zuoren are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lan Will Come to Shanghai in the Next Few Days</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] According to the Shanghai Reception Station of the National Assembly, Zhang Lan, a National Assembly representative from Sichuan Province, will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Xu Chuanlin Elaborates on the Current Situation, Approves of the Responsible Cabinet System</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Xu Fulin, Secretary-General of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters on the 5th that he returned to Shanghai on the 1st, so he did not know much about the current situation of the peace talks in Nanjing. He also had no way of knowing the specific content of the new compromise plan reportedly proposed by Mr. Zhang Junmai. However, judging from the various situations reported in the newspapers, there are many difficulties ahead. He heard in Nanjing before that there was a saying that after the opening ceremony of the National Assembly, there would be a recess for several days to discuss the matter at length. However, according to the law, since the National Assembly has been convened, whether or not to recess is the right of the National Assembly itself. In fact, considering the government's eagerness for governance and the goal of permanent peace and unity, even if the meeting is postponed, it will never damage the government's prestige. He deeply hopes that the government will be open and honest, think from a long-term and broad perspective, and always prioritize tolerance. Mr. Xu believes that the reorganization of the National Government is also difficult in fact. After the establishment of the coalition government in the future, it is feared that a lot of time will be spent on disputes, and the administrative efficiency may not have great progress; what is valuable about the coalition government is that it is a necessary transitional stage before reaching a truly democratic government. Regarding the draft constitution, Mr. Xu said that he himself had participated in drafting the constitution more than once. He met Sun Ke and Wang Honghui, who are currently sorting out the draft constitution, in Nanjing a few days ago. He believes that although the views of all parties on the draft constitution are different, there should not be any serious problems in general. He himself believes that a responsible cabinet system is more appropriate.</p>
<h3>Political Council Approves the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship and Commerce</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The Sino-US Treaty of Commerce was approved by the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 5th and will be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval and then to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. Then it will be approved by the National Government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan will hold a meeting on the 9th to discuss the new Sino-US Treaty of Commerce. It is also heard that both China and the United States will approve it at the same time.</p>
<h3>Clauses on Opening Haikou Must Be Properly Used</h3>
<p>Shanghai Shipping Industry Submits Opinions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] According to Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Industry Association, Article 22 of the Navigation Section of the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce stipulates that the various taxes and fees levied on the ships of the contracting countries shall not be higher than those of domestic ships. Paragraph 2 of Article 23 stipulates that the premiums, tax refunds, and other preferential treatments of any kind given to goods exported and imported by domestic ships shall also be given to the ships of the contracting countries. These two points are not conducive to the national merchant ships and international trade of countries with immature industries and shipping industries. It is hoped that vigilance will be exercised in the implementation to avoid adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 of Article 21 stipulates that there should be freedom of commerce and navigation between the territories of the contracting parties. This freedom should refer to international navigation. The ports where ships of the contracting countries can dock should refer to the coastal ports of commerce open to international navigation in the country, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The right to open or not to open these ports of commerce is in the hands of the national government.</p>
<p>Article 24 stipulates that the ships of the contracting countries may load and unload a part of the cargo at any port or place within the territorial waters of the country that is open to foreign commerce and navigation, and then transport the remaining cargo to other ports. This kind of accommodation is also very prone to abuse.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 of the same article, regarding the assumed most-favored-nation clause for inland river navigation and coastal trade, is actually superfluous. The new Sino-US equality clearly stipulates that the United States abandons its rights to inland river navigation and coastal trade in China. The treaty is based on the agreement supplemented by the former clause. However, some people believe that after the treaty is concluded, China will not guarantee the right to inland river and coastal navigation, which is a misunderstanding. If the government opens up inland river and coastal navigation, our shipping industry will resolutely oppose it. International navigation has been established since the 16th century with the establishment of the high seas system, and the commercial revolution broke the old rules of closing the country to the outside world, which has been generally adopted by all countries. Except for military reasons, few people prohibit it. Now is the time for China to provide relief and reconstruction, and it needs the United States to transport a large number of machines and materials. Local products such as tung oil, raw silk, tea, pig bristles, and medicinal materials are also in urgent need of promotion and export. It is deeply hoped that after the implementation of the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce, economic cooperation between the two countries will be strengthened, and the United States will be able to transfer its surplus ships and shipbuilding equipment to China on favorable terms to help us establish a new-style merchant fleet. This is what the national shipping industry urgently hopes from the United States and the public.</p>

<h3>The Ugly Side of an Old Gun is Fully Exposed: Sheng You'an, a Rebel, Was Interrogated Yesterday; It is Alleged That the Property List in the Report Does Not Match the Reality</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Sheng Laosan (Sheng You'an), the opium king of Shanghai, known for his notoriety, was interrogated in the High Court on the 5th. At 10:30 AM, Judge Wang Hongquan, accompanied by Clerk Chen Zuo, opened the investigation court. Sheng, wearing a gray striped woolen jacket, blue silk zipper narrow-leg pants, and broken black satin round-toe shoes, was escorted into court by his family. He was hunched over in the defendant's seat, his figure withered, his hair streaked with gray, his beady eyes opening and closing from time to time, and his toothless, sunken mouth muttering defenses in an inaudible voice, completely in the demeanor of an old gun. In court, he was questioned one by one about his property and various property rights lawsuits recently received by the court. Sheng also answered each question, cunningly claiming that all his property was purchased out of a "charitable heart" and through "legal procedures," and that he never took advantage of the enemy's power to forcibly seize or purchase anything. Regarding the various property rights lawsuits obtained by the High Court a few days ago, he excused himself by saying that the accusers were "extremely poor and bored, and falsely accused him in times of danger." Sheng also claimed: "All my family property has been sealed by the Military Statistics Bureau, which can be said to be all confiscated. Some time ago, I saw in the Shanghai newspaper that the list of my property, the 62 gold bars, had become 47. I request the court to issue a document to the Military Statistics Bureau and the Enemy Property Bureau to first send the list for legal processing." The court agreed. The interrogation ended at 11:45 AM, and the court ordered his return to custody. This cunning old man in his seventies was again escorted out of the courtroom by his family, his gait staggering and his face ashen, his miserable state both laughable and pitiable. During the enemy-puppet period, Sheng organized the "Hongji Shantang" in Shanghai, promoting the policy of comforting the dead, and served as a tool for the tiger, committing heinous crimes. The court attaches great importance to this. In addition, Luo Hongyi, a member of Sheng's gang, will be interrogated in the High Court at 10 AM on the morning of the 6th.</p>

If the government of either High Contracting Party requires certificates of origin for imports, such requirements must be reasonable and must not constitute an unnecessary impediment to indirect trade.</p>
<p>(2) With respect to the matters referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, nationals, juridical persons, and organizations, ships and cargo, of either High Contracting Party shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded to nationals, juridical persons, and organizations, ships and cargo of any third country within the territory of the other High Contracting Party. With respect to all matters relating to (a) tariffs and surcharges levied on imports or exports and the methods of their collection, (b) the rules, procedures, and fees applicable to the clearance of goods through customs, and (c) the taxation within the country of imported goods and goods intended for export, nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of either High Contracting Party shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded to nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of the other High Contracting Party within the territory of that High Contracting Party.</p>
<p>(3) Neither High Contracting Party shall impose any prohibition or restriction on the import, sale, distribution, or use of any plant, produce, or manufactured goods of the other High Contracting Party, or on the export of any goods destined for the territory of the other High Contracting Party, unless such prohibition or restriction is similarly applied to the import, sale, distribution, or use of the like plant, produce, or manufactured goods of all third countries, or to the export of the like goods destined for all third countries.</p>
<p>(4) If the government of either High Contracting Party imposes any quantitative control on the import or export of any goods, or on the sale, distribution, or use of any imported goods, it shall regularly publish the total quantity or value of such goods permitted to be imported, exported, sold, distributed, or used within a specified period, as well as any changes in such total quantity or value. If either High Contracting Party allocates a portion of such total quantity or value quota to any third country, it shall allocate a portion to the other High Contracting Party for any goods of substantial interest to that Party, based on the proportion of the total quantity or value supplied by the territory of that other High Contracting Party during a representative period, or, in the case of exports, based on the proportion of the total quantity or value destined for the territory of that other High Contracting Party during a representative period, and, to the extent possible, shall take into account any special factors, past or present, which may affect the trade in such goods, unless otherwise mutually agreed. The provisions of this paragraph concerning imports shall also apply to restrictions imposed on the quantity or value of any goods permitted to be imported free of customs duties or taxes, or subject to specific rates of customs duties or taxes.</p>
<p>Article XVII</p>
<p>(1) The laws of both High Contracting Parties, the regulations of their administrative officials, and the decisions of their administrative or judicial officials, relating to the classification of goods for customs purposes or to rates of duty, shall be promptly published in a manner readily accessible to merchants. Such laws, regulations, and decisions shall be applied uniformly in all ports of the respective High Contracting Party; provided, however, that either High Contracting Party may have special regulations in its laws, whether existing or future, for goods entering its island territories and possessions.</p>
<p>(2) Administrative decisions by the government of either High Contracting Party which increase rates of duty or charges applied to imports from the territory of the other High Contracting Party or which impose any new requirement on such imports, shall generally not apply to plant, produce, or manufactured goods of the other High Contracting Party which are already in transit at the time such decisions are published in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1; but this procedure shall be deemed to be in full compliance with the provisions of this paragraph if either High Contracting Party customarily exempts from such newly established or increased burdens goods entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption within thirty days after the date of the aforementioned publication. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to administrative orders imposing anti-dumping duties or to regulations relating to the protection of human, animal, or plant life or health, or relating to public safety, or implementing court judgments.</p>
<p>(3) Either High Contracting Party shall prescribe administrative, judicial, or other procedures by which nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of the other High Contracting Party, as well as importers of plants, produce, or manufactured goods of that High Contracting Party, may appeal decisions by customs authorities regarding fines and penalties imposed on them, acts of confiscation by customs authorities, and questions regarding the classification of goods for customs purposes and their valuation. In the case of any import made by nationals, juridical persons, or organizations of the other High Contracting Party, or of any import of plants, produce, or manufactured goods of that High Contracting Party, if an error is made in documentation and such error is clearly due to clerical error or can be proven to be made in good faith, then the High Contracting Party shall not impose a penalty higher than a nominal one.</p>
<p>(4) The government of either High Contracting Party shall give sympathetic consideration to opinions presented by the government of the other High Contracting Party regarding prohibitions or restrictions on imports or exports, quantitative controls, customs regulations or procedures, or the implementation or enforcement of health laws or regulations for the protection of human, animal, or plant life or health.</p>
<p>Article XVIII</p>
<p>(1) Plants, produce, or manufactured goods of either High Contracting Party, upon being imported into the territory of the other High Contracting Party, shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded to like plants, produce, or manufactured goods of the other High Contracting Party with respect to all matters relating to internal taxes.</p>
<p>(2) Goods produced, produced, or manufactured wholly or partly by nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of the other High Contracting Party, or by juridical persons and organizations organized or participated in by such nationals, juridical persons, and organizations, within the territory of either High Contracting Party, shall be accorded treatment within that territory, with respect to all matters relating to internal taxes or export from that territory, no less favorable than that accorded at present or in the future to like goods produced, produced, or manufactured wholly or partly by nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of that High Contracting Party, or by juridical persons and organizations organized or participated in by such nationals, juridical persons, and organizations, within that territory. In any event, the goods prescribed in the preceding sentence shall not be accorded treatment less favorable than that accorded at present or in the future to like goods produced, produced, or manufactured wholly or partly by nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of any third country, or by juridical persons and organizations organized or participated in by such nationals, juridical persons, and organizations.</p>
<p>Article XIX</p>
<p>(1) If the government of either High Contracting Party establishes or maintains any form of control over methods of international payment or international financial transactions, fair treatment shall be accorded to the nationals, juridical persons, organizations, and commerce of the other High Contracting Party in all aspects of such control.</p>
<p>(2) The government of either High Contracting Party establishing or maintaining such control shall not apply any prohibition, restriction, or delay to remittances for the purchase of any plant, produce, or manufactured goods of the other High Contracting Party that is not applied to remittances for the purchase of the like plant, produce, or manufactured goods of any third country. Regarding the exchange rate and regarding taxes or charges on exchange transactions, the plants,</p>
<p>produce, or manufactured goods of either High Contracting Party shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded at present or in the future to the like plant, produce, or manufactured goods of any third country. The provisions of this paragraph shall also apply to such control applied to payments necessary or incidental to the import of plants, produce, or manufactured goods of the other High Contracting Party. In short, the implementation of any such control shall not affect the competitive relationship between the plants, produce, or manufactured goods of the other High Contracting Party and the like plant, produce, or manufactured goods of any third country in a way that is detrimental to that High Contracting Party.</p>
<p>(3) With respect to all matters of exchange of profits, dividends, interest, payments for imports, and other funds, and loans and other international financial transactions, between the territories of the High Contracting Parties, or between the territory of either High Contracting Party whose government establishes or maintains control as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the territory of any third country, the government of that country which establishes or maintains control shall accord to the nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of the other High Contracting Party treatment no less favorable than that accorded at present or in the future to its own nationals, juridical persons, and organizations, and no less favorable than that accorded to nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of any third country who are party to the same exchange and loan transactions between the same two territories, whether such exchange and loan transactions were made directly or through an intermediary or intermediaries within one or more countries not party to this Treaty. This treatment shall apply to exchange rates and to any prohibitions, restrictions, delays, taxes, or other charges applicable to the exchanges, loans, and other transactions described in this paragraph. In short, the implementation of any such control shall not affect the competitive relationship between the nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of the other High Contracting Party and the nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of any third country in a way that is detrimental to that High Contracting Party.</p>
<p>Article XX</p>
<p>(1) If the government of either High Contracting Party establishes or maintains a monopoly or public agency for the import, export, purchase, sale, distribution, or production of any goods, or grants any agency exclusive privileges for the import, export, purchase, sale, distribution, or production of any goods, such monopoly or agency shall, with respect to the purchase of foreign plants, produce, or manufactured goods, or the sale of goods for export to foreign countries, accord fair treatment to the commerce of the other High Contracting Party. To achieve this goal, such monopoly or agency, in purchasing or selling any goods, shall be entirely dependent on private commercial enterprises, and shall take into account those matters which are typically considered for the purpose of buying and selling such goods on the most advantageous terms, such as price, quality, sales channels, transportation, and conditions of sale. If the government of either High Contracting Party establishes or maintains a monopoly or agency for the sale of any service, or grants any agency the exclusive privilege to sell any service, such monopoly or agency shall, with respect to transactions involving such service, accord fair treatment to the other High Contracting Party and its nationals, juridical persons, organizations, and commerce, in accordance with the treatment granted at present or in the future to any third country and its nationals, juridical persons, organizations, and commerce.</p>
<p>(2) When granting concessions and other contractual rights, and when purchasing supplies, the government of either High Contracting Party shall accord fair treatment to the other High Contracting Party and its nationals, juridical persons, organizations, and commerce, in comparison with the treatment granted at present or in the future to any third country and its nationals, juridical persons, organizations, and commerce.</p>

<p>(2) Any vessel flying the flag of either High Contracting Party and possessing documents proving its nationality as prescribed by its national laws shall be deemed to be a vessel of that High Contracting Party in the ports, places, and territorial waters of the other High Contracting Party, and on the high seas. The term "vessel" as used in this Article shall be interpreted to include all vessels of either High Contracting Party, whether privately owned or operated, or publicly owned or operated. However, the provisions of this Article, except for this paragraph and paragraph 5 of Article XXII, shall not be interpreted as granting rights to warships or fishing vessels of the other High Contracting Party, nor shall it be interpreted as granting any special advantages, exclusive to national fisheries or their products, to the nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of the other High Contracting Party, ships and cargo, or to plants, produce, or manufactured goods of the other High Contracting Party.</p>

<p>(1) Vessels and cargo of either High Contracting Party shall, in all respects, be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded by the other High Contracting Party to its own vessels and cargo in the ports, places, and territorial waters of that other High Contracting Party, regardless of the port of departure or destination of the vessel, and regardless of the origin or destination of the cargo.</p>
<p>(2) No tonnage tax, harbor tax, pilotage fee, lighthouse fee, quarantine fee, or any other similar or equivalent tax or charge of any kind or denomination collected in the name of or for the benefit of the government, officials, private individuals, juridical persons, or any kind of organization in the ports, places, and territorial waters of either High Contracting Party shall be levied on vessels of the other High Contracting Party except under the same circumstances in which such taxes and fees are levied on national vessels.</p>
<p>(3) The measures taken in regard to charges for passengers, fares or tickets, freight already paid or not paid, bills of lading, insurance or reinsurance contracts, etc., and the conditions relating to the employment of shipping agents of any nationality, as well as the arrangements made for any other fees or conditions, shall not be such as to grant any preference to vessels of the other High Contracting Party over vessels of the first High Contracting Party.</p>
<p>(4) Either High Contracting Party shall provide qualified pilots at the ports, places, and territorial waters now or hereafter open to foreign commerce and navigation to guide vessels of the other High Contracting Party in and out of the aforementioned ports, places, and territorial waters.</p>
<p>(5) If a vessel of either High Contracting Party is compelled by bad weather or any other peril to take refuge in any port, place, or territorial water of the other High Contracting Party not open to foreign commerce or navigation, such vessel shall receive friendly treatment and assistance, as well as necessary and available supplies and repair materials. This paragraph shall also apply to warships and fishing vessels, as well as vessels as provided in Article XXI, paragraph 2.</p>
<p>(6) In any event, the treatment given to vessels and cargo of either High Contracting Party in regard to the matters referred to in this Article shall be no less favorable than the treatment given at present or in the future to vessels and cargo of any third country.</p>

<p>(1) All articles which are or shall be legally importable into the territories of either High Contracting Party in vessels of that High Contracting Party may likewise be imported in vessels of the other High Contracting Party, without being subject to any other or higher duties or charges of any kind than if such articles were imported in vessels of the High Contracting Party.</p>

With respect to the matters referred to in this paragraph, vessels and cargo of either High Contracting Party shall be accorded treatment in the ports, places, and territorial waters of the other High Contracting Party no less favorable than that accorded at present or in the future to vessels and cargo of any third country.</p>
<p>(2) If either High Contracting Party grants the rights of inland navigation or coastal trade to vessels of any third country, such rights shall likewise be granted to vessels of the other High Contracting Party. The coastal trade and inland navigation of either High Contracting Party shall not be subject to national treatment, but shall be governed by the laws of that High Contracting Party concerning coastal trade and inland navigation. The two High Contracting Parties agree that the treatment enjoyed by vessels of either High Contracting Party in the territory of the other High Contracting Party with respect to coastal trade and inland navigation shall be as favorable as the treatment granted to vessels of any third country. Trade between either High Contracting Party and its island possessions or territories shall be regarded as coastal trade within the meaning of this paragraph.</p>

Such persons, baggage, and goods in transit shall not be subject to any transit tax, or to any unnecessary delay or restriction, or to any discrimination with respect to charges, facilities, or any other matter.

<h3>Starting from the Absurd Statement of the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) delegation issued an absurd statement on the 4th of this month, with two main points: (1) The National Assembly convened on November 12 was a unilateral action by the Kuomintang government in violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The PCC resolutions are a temporary constitution, so any violation is an act of destroying the law, and the CCP protests against participating. (2) The claim that the "draft constitution formulated by the PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee is the blueprint" is unfounded both legally and factually. We find it very surprising: the CCP is actually talking about "law" today, actually demanding that there be a basis in "law," and even pointing out that the National Government's convening of the National Assembly on the 12th of this month is an "act of destroying the law." This is truly a legal theory of wild imagination!</p>
<p>In response to this absurd statement by the CCP, the government has already issued a rebuttal yesterday, generally saying: Whether the National Assembly can be convened as scheduled depends on whether the number of participating representatives reaches the legal quorum. The CCP's participation is purely a political issue, so if enough representatives report to meet the quorum, it can be held. Even if the CCP refuses to participate, it will not prevent the National Assembly from being convened as scheduled. As for which side's "law," the government's or the CCP's, is more reasonable, clear-sighted people can understand without being told.</p>
<p>First, we must remind everyone in the government and the public: Today, China has only one legitimate government, and that is the National Government, which is recognized by both domestic and foreign parties; today, China only has laws passed by the legal legislative body of the National Government that the people should abide by. No matter how the National Government will be reorganized recently, before the constitution is promulgated and constitutional government is implemented, China is still in the period of political tutelage in the process of revolutionary nation-building based on the Three Principles of the People. The reason why the National Government wants to convene the National Assembly today is to move from political tutelage to constitutional government step by step. However, in this transitional period, if everyone does not abide by the law first, especially if they can overstep the law to accommodate realistic politics, who will respect the constitution produced in the process of violating the law? Therefore, the CCP is racking its brains at this moment, trying to hold up the two words "destroying the law" to scare the government, fool the people, and shake their determination to convene the National Assembly as scheduled. In fact, if we don't talk about the law, everything the CCP has done is a violation of the law. The CCP's "destruction of the law" theory is tantamount to exposing its own crimes! What legal basis does the "Border Region Government" in Yan'an have? What legal basis does the title "Democratic Allied Forces" have? What legal basis is there for banning legal tender and over-issuing anti-Japanese currency and border notes? What legal basis is there for the conscription and taxation in the "Liberated Areas"? The CCP's own acts of destroying the law and disrupting discipline are too numerous to mention, but they are all ignored, and instead, they falsely accuse our country's only legitimate government of ordering the convening of the National Assembly to make a constitution as "destroying the law." This is truly an unprecedented story!</p>
<p>Second, regarding the nature of the Political Consultative Conference, we pointed out at the time that it was merely a political measure to resolve party disputes, a political meeting where all parties exchanged opinions and reached common conclusions, and should never be regarded as a national legislative body, let alone a body representing public opinion. Therefore, mutual respect for the PCC resolutions is the political responsibility of all parties, and not a legal issue at all. In other words, if the PCC resolutions have not been passed by the national legislative body and the procedures have not been approved by the people's representatives, then there is no way to talk about "law," let alone falsely calling it a "temporary constitution"? Since there is no such thing as a temporary constitution, how can the convening of the National Assembly on the 12th of this month be forcibly labeled as an "act of destroying the law"? We must make it clear that, in the eyes of the people, the PCC resolutions are nothing more than a gentleman's agreement on a political truce between various parties, and have nothing to do with the people of the whole country. Moreover, the focus of the PCC resolutions was originally nothing more than reorganizing the National Government, convening the National Assembly, and formulating a constitution based on the revision opinions suggested by the PCC. Today, the government is working hard to implement these points. The government first expressed its willingness to reorganize the National Government Committee immediately, and then expressed that the National Assembly's constitution-making would be based on the draft constitution formulated by the PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee. It can be seen that the government is sincerely abiding by the PCC resolutions to fulfill its political responsibilities. On the other hand, the CCP is not satisfied with reorganizing the National Government Committee, does not disclose the list of National Assembly representatives, and even openly declares its refusal to participate in the National Assembly, and then incites other parties to echo it, in an attempt to obstruct the work of the National Assembly to make a constitution. Therefore, it is the CCP itself that violates the PCC resolutions!</p>
<p>In short, standing from the people's standpoint, we want to shout loudly, please all parties and factions, open your eyes today to look at Japan, and then look back at yourselves. Be very vigilant, and never cause trouble again, harming the overall situation of the country, especially do not mistakenly fall into the CCP's trap of destroying the country's peace and unity! Today, we only have one demand, which is to reorganize the National Government Committee and convene the National Assembly as scheduled to make a constitution. Only in this way can the country achieve true peace and unity. The government must carry this out responsibly, and all parties and factions with a national concept must also cooperate in this way to be worthy of the people. Those who waver, hesitate, wait and see, and delay this undead and unalive situation, or even destroy and obstruct it, causing the country to fall into a more chaotic situation, are all sinners of the nation for thousands of years!</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Discuss the Italian Peace Treaty; Sharp Disputes Between the US and the Soviet Union; Will Listen to the Opinions of Representatives from Italy and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] The four foreign ministers are scheduled to continue their meeting at 8:30 PM today. (4:30 AM, Shanghai time, 6th) Before the meeting yesterday, the four foreign ministers received a protest letter from the Italian government regarding some parts of the peace treaty, which pointed out the excessive amount of reparations, the impropriety of the demarcation of boundaries, and stated that the treaty was not in accordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 5th] The four foreign ministers met in the afternoon yesterday in the Astoria Hotel parlor to discuss the disputed points in the Italian peace treaty. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov frequently argued with the other foreign ministers, so there were few concrete results after three hours of discussion. The first topic of discussion was the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia. Both Italy and Yugoslavia had the right to speak, but the question was which country should speak first. After careful discussion, it was decided that the Italian representative would express his opinion first, and then the Yugoslav representative would state his opinion.</p>
<p>Next, regarding the clauses on the border between Austria and Italy, Molotov refused to insert the agreement between the two countries on the status of the people of Tyrol into the peace treaty. Byrnes said that the four foreign ministers had no reason to abandon the decision adopted by a two-thirds majority at the Paris Peace Conference. The four powers had put a lot of effort into the signing of the Austrian treaty and should formally approve it as the right thing to do. However, Molotov firmly refused, saying that the people of Tyrol were dissatisfied with this agreement, so the issue remained unresolved.</p>
<p>Then, the discussion turned to the articles added to the peace treaty, which stipulated that the people in the ceded territory of Italy should be guaranteed human rights and various fundamental freedoms. This article had been passed by a two-thirds majority at the Peace Conference. Molotov said that the insertion of this was not necessary, because the victorious allies did not need to be suspected of intending to deprive people of their freedom, and that the inclusion of this article contradicted previous articles. Byrnes and Molotov debated repeatedly, without any agreement being reached. The issue was also temporarily shelved.</p>
<p>Finally, the discussion turned to Italy's reparations to Greece and Yugoslavia. The Paris Peace Conference decided that each country would receive US$100 million. Molotov believed that this figure was unfair, because the loss of the port of Trieste had greatly reduced what Yugoslavia had hoped to gain from the Peace Conference. Therefore, the compensation to Yugoslavia and Greece should be calculated at a ratio of two to one. British Foreign Secretary Bevin vehemently opposed this, saying that he would never accept this plan, because in his view, Greece had already been treated unfairly. Byrnes pointed out that the ceded territory that Yugoslavia had obtained, including coal mines and industrial equipment, was worth US$195 million, which was part of the reparations. However, Molotov expressed his disagreement, saying that this equipment was located within Yugoslav territory and could not be used as reparations. Molotov took the opportunity to explain the harsh treatment of Yugoslavia in the peace treaty, and that the four foreign ministers should not impose too much loss on that country.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 4th] Before the foreign ministers' meeting was convened this afternoon, Byrnes held talks with Bevin, Molotov, and French Deputy Foreign Minister Chauvel separately. Byrnes had told Bevin that the handling of the Palestine issue had been transferred to him by President Truman. During their meeting today, they also discussed the merger of the British and American zones in Germany. Byrnes said that he would discuss the Palestine issue with them during the time outside of the foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship Issues Unfold in a War of Words; The British and Soviet Blocs Stand in Opposition; The Prime Minister of South Africa Demands Full Annexation of Southwest Africa; Thomas Describes British Empire Colonial Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 5th] The Trusteeship Committee will continue its meeting at 8:00 PM today. Indian representative Singh will speak first, and will likely propose a new resolution advocating that trust territories be governed by the United Nations, rather than by individual countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] The United Nations Trusteeship Committee began its work today. Before submitting appropriate recommendations for action to the General Assembly and possibly establishing a Trusteeship Council, the Committee will first examine the agreements and reports submitted by the major powers responsible for governing non-self-governing territories. South African Prime Minister Smuts formally requested the annexation of the Southwest African territory under his mandate today. Smuts denied Ukraine's accusation that South Africa's request was sudden, saying that he had announced his desire at the San Francisco Conference last year and at Bredton this year, and that he had anticipated Soviet opposition beforehand, but he did not take Soviet opposition seriously, saying that the matter would be discussed with the people of Southwest Africa. Smuts told the Soviet Union that there were some territories that had been annexed without similar consultations. Later, another representative of the British Empire, Colonial Under-Secretary Thomas, spoke, counterattacking the Soviet Union's accusations, condemning the Soviet Union for shelving Britain's draft trusteeship agreement and preventing the early establishment of the Trusteeship Council. The "trusteeship battle" is unfolding, with the lineup being the British Commonwealth against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] British Colonial Under-Secretary Thomas said in the Trusteeship Committee that Molotov had previously stated that the United Nations organization had been established for two years, but the mandated countries had not taken any steps to establish a Trusteeship Council. The British delegation was deeply surprised by this statement, wondering how his intelligence was so poor. As far as Britain is concerned, every step has been taken, and Britain was the first to publish the terms of the mandate. Thomas explained Britain's colonial policy, saying that the trusteeship system drafted by Britain was a product of modern British policy, and that the basic freedoms in British colonies were more adequately guaranteed than in many other sovereign countries. Some say that colonies are a source of wealth for Britain, but in fact Britain has planned to spend 120 million pounds paid by British taxpayers on the colonies in the next ten years. Britain has always believed that self-government is the ultimate destiny of the colonies, so it will do its best to train the people of the colonies to develop towards self-government.

<h3>Our Correspondent Broadcasts in New York</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in New York, 4th] The United Nations Radio and WLIB Radio invited our correspondent Mao Shuqing to give a radio speech. Mr. Mao broadcast in Chinese on the United Nations Radio, entitled "Chinese Journalists at the General Assembly." This afternoon, he also broadcast in English on WLIB Radio, discussing the Chinese Communist Party issue, strongly stating that "this issue is China's internal affair and can only be resolved by China itself."</p>
<h3>Economic Unification of Germany; British and Americans to Open Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: The British and American sides have decided to start negotiations on the issue of economic cooperation between the two countries in Germany next week.

<h3>Security Council Adopts Polish Proposal; The Spanish Case Removed from the Agenda; To Be Directly Debated by the General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 4th] The Security Council unanimously passed Poland's resolution today, removing the Spanish issue from the Security Council's agenda so that it could be directly debated by the full General Assembly. Polish representative Lange said that there were already many records on this issue, and these documents would be handed over to the full General Assembly for handling. This move does not affect the rights and privileges of the Security Council, and any member is still free to raise the issue. Poland's motion was seconded by the United States, which advocated that the Council should study whether other issues should be handled in the same way. This was clearly an indirect indication of the long-pending issues of the Soviet Union and Iran.</p>

<h3>First Major Election in the United States After the War; The Republican Party is Doing its Best to Compete; The Outcome of the Election Determines the Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 5th Broadcast, New York News: President Truman voted at 3:15 PM today and then took a train back to Washington.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The US election was held today in an enthusiastic atmosphere, but in some areas, voting has not yet been completed due to transportation being blocked by heavy snow (27 inches deep). Preliminary results show that Dewey can be re-elected as the Governor of New York State. Dewey has received many votes this time, indicating that he has hopes for the presidency in the future.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] On the eve of the election of all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the senators by 35 million men and women citizens of the United States, the Republican Party's victory is expected by most people. Those participating in the campaign are still giving speeches everywhere tonight, but President Truman has not said a word since the start of the campaign. The House of Representatives has a total of 432 seats, and the senators to be re-elected have a total of 35 seats. In the current House of Representatives, the Republican Party occupies 192 seats. If it can win 26 more seats, it can gain a majority advantage of 216 seats. The Democratic Party originally occupied 235 seats. If it only loses 17 seats, it can still maintain its control. In the Senate, the Republican Party originally had 39 seats. If it can win 10 more seats, it can gain the upper hand. The Democratic Party originally had 56 seats. If it only loses 7 seats, it will not affect the retention of its advantage. Before the election, the two parties inevitably made predictions about the election results. Democratic Party Chairman Hannegan said: The number of seats for the Democratic Party in both houses is expected to increase again, while Republican Party Chairman Reece said: The Republican Party in the House of Representatives may increase by 7 to 14 seats. Political observers also predict that a third party, the Labor Party, will be formed, and at least four people are expected to lead the new party to success in the election. These four people are Wallace, who recently resigned as Secretary of Commerce, Interior Secretary of the former Roosevelt cabinet, Ickes, who also resigned due to disagreements with Truman, Murray, the president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, who helped President Roosevelt win four presidential elections, and Senator Pepper, the far-left authority on foreign policy in the Senate. However, these four people seem to be willing to stay in the Democratic Party and continue their work in their positions. They hope that by the time of the next presidential election in 1948, their efforts and the inevitable economic development can change the Democratic Party's organization and make it a progressive party. If so, the Democratic Party will lose the support of conservative Democrats in the southern states, but it can also gain the support of liberals from the Republican Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] Today, more than 35 million voters in the United States elected senators and representatives from more than 1,000 candidates. The results of voting in the 16 major states will likely indicate the trend of the US Congress in the next two years. The Republican and Democratic parties are fiercely competing in these states. Which party will control both the House and Senate of the 80th Congress will determine the situation. In addition, governors are also being re-elected in 30 states at the same time. The election trend is most notable for the Republican Party's offensive to seize nine Senate seats from the Democratic Party. If this is successful, the Republican Party will gain control of the Senate for the first time in 16 years. These nine seats are being elected in the nine states of New York, Massachusetts, Missouri, Idaho, Montana, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, and New Mexico. The Democratic Party is also making a desperate effort to win votes in Kentucky and California. The results of the elections in the above 15 states, plus Illinois, which does not require fierce competition, can influence the overall situation. Most observers predict that this election war can measure the public's level of resistance to the Truman administration's handling of meat and other controls, and the dissatisfaction with the general situation of demobilization. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace said in a speech in New York that if the Republican Party wins, the world can regard this as a sign of reaction in the United States. Republican Senator Taft said in Chicago that the Democratic and Republican parties are almost identical on foreign policy.</p>
<h3>The De Gaulle Faction in France: Expressing Pro-American, Anti-Soviet Sentiments</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] London, May 5th (Radio Broadcast): Mr. Capitant, a former Minister of Education and close associate of De Gaulle, stated in a speech at a De Gaulle League gathering today that the alliance's foreign policy is to ally with the United States to prevent the threat of Soviet imperialism. This speech is the most explicit pro-American, anti-Soviet declaration by a French politician since the liberation of France. Most observers believe that the De Gaulle faction has gradually abandoned its previous strict neutral stance. [Special Dispatch from our Tokyo Correspondent, dated the 4th] After the promulgation of the new Japanese constitution, the Liberal, Progressive, and Social Democratic parties have all expressed their admiration. The Communist Party stated that the new constitution still preserves capitalism and the Emperor system of large landowners, and that they will strive for a republican constitution to protect civil rights and realize democracy. Japanese democratic movement leader Ozaki stated that on the day the old constitution was promulgated, the unfortunate assassination of the Minister of Education occurred, and he hopes that a similar event will not occur today. However, the day before the promulgation of the new constitution, the Tokyo District Court sentenced Matsushima Matsutaro to eight months imprisonment for defaming the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Jewish Detainees Released by Britain; Jewish Purchase of Hundreds of Ships a Natural Phenomenon for Refugees</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Paris, May 5th (Urgent Radio Dispatch from London): The British government has announced the release of several Palestinian Arabs who have been detained until now. The rumor that detainees from Jewish associations have also been released has been confirmed by British officials. These Arab figures were imprisoned on the island of Seyschelles for several years for conducting anti-British propaganda.</p>
<p>[United Press, Haifa, May 5th] British naval intelligence officers here said today that Jewish secret organizations have purchased at least a hundred ships to transport Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine.

<h3>New York Times Publishes Article Evaluating Sino-American Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, May 5th] The "New York Times" commented on the Sino-American commercial treaty, stating that this is the first treaty with extensive content signed by the government after the war, and that it will set a precedent for future treaties that the United States may wish to conclude with other countries. A key provision of the treaty stipulates that any mineral development rights granted by either party to a third country must also be granted to the other party. The newspaper stated that Assistant Secretary of State Clayton had stated that the U.S. government will provide greater support for investments in the development of products it lacks or relies on from overseas. Based on this point, the provisions in the treaty are of particular significance.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Commerce Association Expanding Scope of Activities; Membership Reaches 400 Companies</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, New York, May 5th] Mr. Feuer, the president of the Sino-American Commerce Association, announced that the association's scope of activities will be expanded to other regions in Asia, becoming the first American trade association dedicated to promoting American trade with the Far East and India. The association's name has been changed to the Far East American Commerce and Industry Association, but its China branch will retain its original name. As circumstances permit, its area of activity will be expanded to other regions. Due to the firm demands of its members, the China branch has become a typical example of the association's work. This requirement, which began during the war, is the result of major changes in the economic and political situation in the Far East. The association was founded in 1943 and now has 400 member companies, representing many of the American industries engaged in trade in the Pacific region.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government to Organize Economic Stabilization Conference</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, May 5th] In order to urgently seek economic recovery, the Japanese government intends to organize an Economic Stabilization Conference.

<h3>Sleeping in a Doghouse Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>[United Press, Omaha, Nebraska, May 4th] A man, after a domestic quarrel, stormed out of his home and went to the back of a building in the city, where he found a dog kennel. He chased the dog out and slept inside. The evicted dog barked incessantly, as if complaining. A police officer found this strange, investigated, and discovered a man sleeping soundly in the doghouse. The dog was returned to its original kennel, while the man was arrested for trespassing and imprisoned. The man confessed: "I whistled, the dog ran out, and I went in."</p>

<h3>Mayor Explains Cost of Living Index, Clarifies Compilation Principles Limited to Daily Necessities, Gold-Based Wage Calculation Already Better Than Pre-War, End of Solar and Lunar Year Are Two Major Hurdles</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Regarding the cost of living index published monthly by the municipal government, many workers in the city have had doubts in the past two months and have requested explanations and improvements. Mayor Wu stated at yesterday afternoon's reception for the heads of various newspapers that in the past two months, many workers in the city have had doubts about the cost of living index published by the municipal government. The reason for this is that various places compile price indices, while this city compiles a cost of living index. The scope of price indices is wider, including soaring construction materials, and therefore the index shows a sharp monthly increase. However, this is not the case with the cost of living index. The current workers' cost of living index only uses daily necessities such as rice, fuel, and cloth as the basis. The municipal government has always taken suppressing these basic commodity prices as the principle, so daily necessities have never fluctuated greatly. This is the main reason why the cost of living index has risen so minimally. If yarn prices stabilize, cloth prices are expected to fall, so the November cost of living index will not only not rise, but may even fall.</p>
<p>The reason why workers are so suspicious is that they see the frequent rises in price indices in various places. At the same time, workers occasionally go to see a movie or buy a box of matches, and they think that prices are soaring. However, this is not enough to serve as the basis for the cost of living index. The price index and the cost of living index absolutely cannot be confused, and the price increases of certain imported goods and luxury goods are not the daily necessities of workers, so they cannot be included as the basis for calculating the cost of living index.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also used various examples to make workers understand that due to the adjustment of base salaries, they are already better than before the war. Before the war, wages were only enough to buy 1.5 dan of rice, while now each worker's monthly income is enough to buy more than 3.5 dan of rice. Even calculated in gold, workers' income today is better than before the war. Therefore, the workers' cost of living index has clearly increased compared to before the war. According to Mayor Wu's observation, the end of the solar year and the end of the lunar year this year are two major hurdles that must be overcome with the close cooperation of both labor and capital. If workers can no longer understand the current difficulties of the capitalists, it is tantamount to "killing the chicken to get the egg," and the result will definitely be that the chicken dies, and the egg cannot be obtained either.</p>
<h3>Deeply Hope City Saves Electricity, Benefit Increase Production</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu also emphasized the issue of electricity conservation in the city at the reception for the heads of various newspapers, saying that Shanghai can currently produce 60,000 pieces of cotton yarn per day, and if all spindles are started, it can reach 80,000 pieces. Although the production volume of 60,000 pieces is enough to meet the needs of Shanghai, we must also take into account the needs of other regions. The reason why the current production of cotton yarn in Shanghai cannot reach its peak is purely due to the insufficient supply of electricity. Therefore, to encourage production, electricity must be saved. Mayor Wu also said that the implementation of electricity saving measures will inevitably have many difficulties, but the authorities are determined to implement them because it is necessary. The reason why the wartime zoning power outage method was not applied in Shanghai is due to the different environment and the authorities' understanding of the citizens. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that citizens can save electricity automatically, without the authorities taking punitive measures. Lights on all night in stores and excessively bright lights in households are a waste, and it is hoped that they can be saved automatically. If households with ten lights reduce them to seven, or originally 100 candle power lights reduce them to 70 candle power, it will not hinder work within the household and will greatly benefit increased production.</p>
<h3>City Museum to Exhibit Sun Yat-sen's Calligraphy</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Yang Kuan, curator of the Shanghai Municipal Museum (formerly the principal of the Japanese elementary school on North Szechuan Road), has decided to hold a grand Sun Yat-sen calligraphy exhibition at the museum on the 12th of this month, Sun Yat-sen's birthday. On display will be Sun Yat-sen's autographed horizontal scrolls, letters, appointment orders, photos of Sun Yat-sen's various works and life, Sun Yat-sen's works, the books and newspapers he usually read, and records of Sun Yat-sen's words and deeds, books, relics, etc. Most of the relics were collected from Ye Gongchuo, Feng Ziyou, and Lu Danlin. In addition, the museum is also discussing with Dean Sun Zhesheng to borrow some of Sun Yat-sen's relics.</p>
<p>Among the most valuable exhibits is a letter from Sun Yat-sen to Zhang Zuolin in 1923, requesting him to send troops to suppress Chen Jiongming in Guangzhou. There is also a letter from Sun Yat-sen to Ye Gongchuo, informing him to raise more funds for the suppression of the rebel army, as Ye was the Minister of Finance at the time. This exhibition will be the first comprehensive and rich Sun Yat-sen relic exhibition in the city. There was a similar exhibition in Chongqing in 1943, but it was not as rich as this one.</p>
<p>Also reported: The museum welcomes people from all walks of life who have Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy, relics, portraits, and various historical materials related to the Founding Father to send them for display. The deadline for submission is 5:00 p.m. on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Site of Municipal Council Still Not Resolved</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] The site of the Municipal Council was previously resolved in a general meeting to be purchased from the enemy property processing bureau, the former site of the Japanese Overseas Autonomous Association on Tihui Road. The Municipal Council has contacted the municipal government and the processing bureau several times. As a result, the processing bureau stated that the site was booked by the Central Trust Bureau and the U.S. military authorities, originally expiring on November 14th of this year, but can be extended for three months after the expiration date, and the U.S. military authorities have requested an extension. The Municipal Council believes that the first general meeting will be convened in December, and the issue of the meeting site needs to be resolved urgently. Although the U.S. military headquarters has the right to request an extension of three months, the Trust Bureau has the right to decide, so it still asks the municipal government to contact them and request the return of the site.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Reception and Management Office to Close</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] The Municipal Government Reception and Material Management Office has been established for nearly a year. The reception of materials from small enemy and puppet shops has come to an end, and all payments have been handed over to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy Property Processing Bureau one after another. The office will stop receiving documents from the 11th of this month. The valuation and sale of the means of livelihood and decoration of small shops to the current residents will continue until the 20th of this month. If it is not completed by then, it will be registered and transferred to other agencies for handling.</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the Relief Planning Committee of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office Elects Members and Approves Regulations</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] The Relief Work Planning Committee of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office held its first meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, electing members and determining the tasks of the committee. Those present included Wang Renlin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office, Su Gongjun, Xia Xunheng, Zhang Dengying, Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Structural Division representing the Public Works Bureau, Zheng Kun, Li Wendi, Xu Zhaolin, representing the Public Utilities Bureau, Nasi, representing the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Shanghai Office, industrial expert Haida, Hu Boxiang, and Tian Heqing, representing the Industrial Association.</p>
<p>The meeting concluded with the election of Su Gongjun as chairman of the committee. Li Kaidi, Xu Zhaolin, Zhu Guoxi, Zheng Kun, Nasi, Haida, Xia Xunheng, Zhang Dengying, Hu Boxiang, and Tian Heqing were elected as members. The organizational regulations of the committee were passed, and two subgroups were established under the committee: design and distribution, each with five members. It was decided that the purpose of the committee is to recommend the allocation of materials by the headquarters of the Executive Yuan based on the needs of Shanghai, but it does not have the final decision-making power. The main task of the design group is to make various plans according to the actual needs of the relief work in Shanghai. The task of the distribution group is to review and distribute the urgency of materials needed by various units in the city according to the source of materials. At present, the Executive Yuan has limited materials, and the committee will do its best to request them while not allowing waste. Therefore, the work of the two groups should be closely coordinated; empty plans should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Nasi stated that he would report the establishment of the committee in Shanghai to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and state its importance, hoping that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration would provide as many materials as possible. The design group is scheduled to hold a meeting next Thursday, and the distribution group is scheduled to hold a meeting next Tuesday, to begin discussing and carrying out work. The actual relief work in the city will be carried out by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau to Start Buying Tickets and Checking Luggage for Passengers Today; Nanjing and Hangzhou to Be Handled Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] In order to improve the travel of passengers and merchants along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and to solve the difficulties of passengers purchasing tickets and checking luggage and packages, the Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has formulated various measures such as "checking luggage and packages" and "purchasing tickets for passengers." It has been decided to start from today, and Nanjing and Hangzhou will also implement it at the same time. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) Checking luggage: Passengers with luggage only need to notify the business office information desk or the luggage and parcel room at the North Station one day before departure, and a car will be dispatched immediately to pick it up. After the procedures for checking in on behalf of the passenger are completed, the luggage ticket and the required ticket will be sent together. Business offices are also set up in Beijing and Hangzhou. When checking in, a statement is made, and it can be sent to the destination. (2) Checking packages: Merchants who entrust the business office to check in packages on their behalf can purchase a "consignment note" in advance from the business office information desk or the luggage and parcel room at the North Station (a fee of 20 yuan per copy).

<h3>Five Days After Marriage, Bride Imprisoned; Female Special Agent Group Leader Accused of Corruption</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Ke Jinfeng, a woman from Hubei, alias Wang Huaqing, 26 years old, with a beautiful appearance and a higher education, was formerly a major group leader in the special agent group of the First Brigade of the Second Column of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Special Operations Army. During the enemy and puppet period, she was ordered to be stationed in Wuhan to carry out underground work, and she risked her life several times and made many outstanding achievements. On January 11th of this year, she was accused of corruption by her subordinates in Wuhan, and was subsequently detained by a certain local agency for investigation. As a result, she was allowed to be released on bail, and Hubei merchants Chen Bingchen and Xu Yingzha jointly guaranteed her release. By June 26th, the agency summoned Ke Jinfeng but she did not arrive, so the guarantors Chen and Xu were detained in prison for three months. They were temporarily released on September 23rd and ordered to investigate Ke Jinfeng to bring her to justice. After the two were released, they inquired in many ways and learned that Ke was hiding at her uncle's place at 95 Shandong South Road in Shanghai. They took a car to Shanghai and went to the address at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, found her, and handed her over to the street police, who took her to the Huangpu Police Station. According to Ke Jinfeng's confession: When she was in office, there was Xie Zian, a major staff officer of the regiment, who proposed marriage but was unsuccessful, and Zhu Jieshou, a subordinate, who failed to borrow money. The two then secretly plotted to falsely accuse her of corruption. Now it is known that both of them have been sentenced to seven years in prison. After interrogation, the branch office temporarily detained her, waiting to send her to the local prosecutor's office for verification. It is reported that Ke joined the secret work in October 1940. She was arrested by the Japanese invaders a total of four times and suffered brutal torture, and her right arm has become disabled. After arriving in Shanghai for several months, at the suggestion of her uncle, through the intercession of friends, she married Chen Shoujun, who worked as a packaging merchant. She had only been married for five days and experienced the taste of iron bars.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Japanese Ship Flying Sun Flag; Various Parties Concerned Expressed Opinions</h3>
<p>Since the incident in which ships flying the Japanese flag sailed into the Wusongkou and docked at the Pujiang Qiujiang wharf a few days ago, it has aroused close attention from all parties. Although the main ships have sailed away, this matter is of great importance, and all parties are still very concerned. The reporter specially visited the authorities of various relevant agencies yesterday to inquire about the truth and opinions of the matter, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Navy Inspects</p>
<p>(1) Staff Officer Hu of the Fleet Command of the Naval Headquarters, who is responsible for investigating this incident, stated that on the 21st of last month, an American transport ship with a displacement of about 1,800 tons and six Japanese barges (displacement of 267 tons) came from Japan to China. At that time, the navy sent the No. 3 gunboat to the Qiujiang wharf to inspect. The six Japanese ships left Shanghai and sailed away three days later (the 24th). It was recently heard that a Japanese ship had come to Shanghai. The No. 3 gunboat, which was anchored at Gaochang Temple, set out to patrol again, but did not find anything. Staff Officer Hu also stated that according to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the six Japanese barges will come to China again with the American transport ship to carry relief supplies within a few days.</p>
<p>Customs Investigation</p>
<p>(2) Deputy Customs Commissioner Li told the reporter that the customs authorities had not learned of the Japanese ships' entry in advance. After investigation, it was learned that of the seven Japanese ships, six were tugboats and did not carry goods. They were transferred by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from Japan to the Executive Yuan. The other ship was a escort ship sent by MacArthur's headquarters. The flag hoisted at the bow of the ship was the flag of MacArthur's headquarters, so the customs did not stop it when it entered the port. Subsequently, the customs authorities heard that the ships had flown the Japanese flag, so they sent a letter to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration inquiring about the nature of the ships, but have not received a response to date. Deputy Customs Commissioner Li finally stated that the customs is only responsible for inspecting import and export merchant ships and has no right to interfere with ships transporting relief supplies to and from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Tugboats Not Flying</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan explained as follows: The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration admitted that there were six United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration tugboats that were sailed from Japan to China and handed over to the Executive Yuan. The U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan sent a ship to escort them. It is not known whether the ship flew the Sun flag, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is not responsible. However, the six tugboats did not fly the Japanese flag, and there are photos of the six tugboats taken at the time as proof. The six tugboats have now been handed over to the Executive Yuan for use. As for the Executive Yuan, they are unwilling to comment on this matter, only admitting that the six tugboats have been transferred by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the Executive Yuan's Water Transport Brigade for transportation.</p>

No representatives from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission participated. In the afternoon, Dong and others visited Huo Baoshu, the director of the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration. Mr. Huo suggested that the matter was related to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and suggested that the discussion be changed to Nanjing.

<h3>Yangjing Town Drug Trafficking Suspect Case: Residents' Testimony in Court Inconsistent</h3>
<p>Accusation of "King of Heroin" Suddenly Claims Legitimate Grain Merchant</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The three suspects arrested by the police in Yangjing Town in mid-last month for trafficking heroin, Li Yangshi, Huang Aliu, and Huang Panshi, were initially tried yesterday by the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court. Residents of Yangjing jointly accused Huang Aliu of being a notorious drug dealer, known as the "King of Heroin." However, the Yangjing residents who testified in court yesterday claimed that Huang Aliu was a legitimate grain merchant and did not sell heroin. Li Yangshi also denied ever buying heroin from Huang Aliu. Judge Shen Tianbao stated that this case still needed to gather evidence and decided to postpone the trial. The defendant's lawyer requested bail for the defendant, but Judge Shen stated that if the trafficking was proven, the sentence would be severe, so the request was denied.</p>
<h3>German Resident's Residence: Forged Chinese National's Name, French Resident Illegally Occupies, Attempt to Sell Gold Bars, Reported and Handed Over to the Judiciary</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] German resident Jia Tu, who has resided in this city for a long time, owns a residence at 302 Rue Liasse (now Middle Sichuan Road), occupying 0.81 acres, and holds property certificate No. 14235 from the former French Concession Land Office. In 1944, when the German army was losing on the European battlefield, Jia Tu, foreseeing Germany's inevitable defeat, consulted with Frenchman Pu Xu. Pu forged the name of a Chinese national, "Jin Mantang," to transfer the property to the puppet Land Administration Bureau, obtaining a license and a fake contract. After the victory, Jia Tu was briefly held in an internment camp but later managed to secure his release and continued to reside in the house. Recently, as Jia Tu was being sent back to Germany, the Frenchman Pu Xu came forward, falsely claiming that the property belonged to the Mei Yi Electrical Engineering Firm at 2, Lane 645, Fuxu Road (now Yan'an Middle Road), and attempted to sell it for twenty-seven gold bars. In September, someone secretly reported this to the investigation team and the handling bureau. Recently, the investigation team handed the case over to the judiciary for handling.</p>
<h3>China Film Studio No. 2 Does Not Sign Long-Term Contracts with Actors: Cooperation Based Purely on Emotion</h3>
<p>The China Film Studio No. 2 of the Central Propaganda Department has been working for a year since it began operations.

According to studio director Xu Suling, temporary cooperation with any actor is based on mutual agreement.

<h3>Theft on Van Maersk Ship: Two Sailors Handed Over to Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Port Reorganization Committee's Security Group, the truth about the case of the theft of 200 million yuan worth of goods on a Danish ship at Wusongkou is as follows: On the evening of October 30, two sailors, one Danish and one Australian, from a Danish merchant ship, drunkenly stole two boxes of soap from the hold and moved them to the deck.

The Port Police Station, upon receiving the report, issued a warning to the captain and escorted the two sailors to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for questioning on October 31.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping and Forced Marriage Leads to Suspended Sentence: Demanding Compensation for Losses, Changes Heart Upon Seeing the Woman, Unwilling to Terminate Engagement in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Civil Division of the District Court yesterday heard a case of breach of engagement. The plaintiff, Zhang Shunfa, 23 years old, from Nantong, became engaged to Ju Zhuzhu (22 years old), a local, through matchmakers Yan Hanshi and Li Shishi on February 22 of this year. They set the wedding date for the eighth month of the lunar calendar this summer. However, Zhang Shunfa could not wait for the wedding date and attempted to "kidnap" Ju Zhuzhu in May, but was unsuccessful. During the "kidnapping," he injured Ju Zhuzhu's mother, who sued him in the District Court. Zhang Shunfa was sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence for assault. Zhang Shunfa, feeling resentful, hired a lawyer to demand that Ju Zhuzhu compensate him for losses of 1.68 million yuan. When the court session opened at 4 p.m. yesterday, the defendant, Ju Zhuzhu, appeared in court with her mother. Ju Zhuzhu, wearing a light blue cheongsam, stated her reasons in a soft voice, which was quite touching. Under these circumstances, Zhang Shunfa suddenly changed his mind, willing to abandon the demand for compensation and unwilling to terminate the engagement, repeatedly declaring, "I want the person, not the money." However, Ju Zhuzhu firmly stated, "I don't want to marry him," and said: "He is violent by nature, how can I marry him?" The plaintiff's lawyer, seeing Zhang Shunfa change his mind, was greatly surprised and immediately stood up and declared: "The agent only knows to demand compensation. Now that the client wants the person and not the money, the agent has no opinion." The court, feeling that it was inappropriate to make a hasty decision, adjourned the session and announced that a verdict would be delivered on the ninth.</p>

<h3>Throwing Stones and Filling Soil to Repair Seawall: Parts of Liuhe and Haitang Completed, Over 42,000 Labor Days Completed, 85 Tons of Flour Issued as Compensation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The seawalls along the south bank of the Yangtze River from Wusong to Fushan have been in disrepair for years, and were extensively damaged by the enemy and puppet regimes during the occupation, with dozens of breaches. Since its establishment this spring, the Xingzheng Yuan (Executive Yuan) - Jiangsu-Nanjing branch has begun restoration work, and with the assistance of the Water Conservancy Commission, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, and local county governments, the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Committee was established to focus on emergency repairs. The section of Dachang Liuhe is contracted by the China Construction Corporation, and a portion has already been completed. The company specially invited the press of this city yesterday to visit.</p>
<p>The completed seawall is 283 meters long, sloping, and constructed with wooden stakes and boulders. There were originally three breaches in this area, and the river water had flooded inland more than once, with the flood in June of this year being the most severe. At that time, the villagers had carried out preliminary repairs. After the China Construction Corporation contracted the project in July, construction began in mid-August. According to the company's engineers, the construction process involves first filling the bottom with soil-filled sacks, and then driving stakes in two rows, front and back, each stake being five meters long. Then, stones and soil are thrown in, for a total of five or six layers. After the surface layer is piled up and leveled, the seawall is completed. The maximum number of workers per day is about 500, currently about 200, all using the method of work for relief, with each person being given six catties of flour per day by the Xingzheng Yuan. The timber is transported from Fujian, and the stones are collected from Jiangyin, Suzhou and other places. According to the announcement of the Taicang County Post-Disaster Relief Association, the overall situation of the project in Taicang County, from Xuejingtang Estuary to Lumingjing, is approximately 25 kilometers long, and it started at the end of March this year. Workers were collected from 47 townships and towns along the seawall, forming 12 major teams to participate in the work. Over 42,000 labor days have been completed, and over 3,700 bags of flour have been issued, totaling 85 tons. Most of the most dangerous earthen seawalls have been filled and repaired, and many of the less important ones are still being filled and repaired.</p>
<p>Tu Da, director of the Xingzheng Yuan - Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch Chief Technician, Deputy Director of the Subei Canal Project Work Relief Bureau, and Zhu Kaijun, speaker of the Taicang County Council, also inspected the site yesterday and made statements to reporters, hoping that all sectors of society would recognize the importance of seawall engineering. Mr. Tu also reported on the work of the Jiangsu-Nanjing branch of the Xingzheng Yuan, stating that relief work is divided into urgent relief and construction projects. In addition to the seawall project which is already underway, the Yangtze River Dike in the Jiangnan area, the Zhenghe Canal, and the restoration projects of provincial highway bridges are also planned to begin. The dredging of the canal in the Jiangbei area had already been assigned to people to go and negotiate during the period of the Communist occupation. Now that it has been recovered, it can be actively carried out. Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, Zheng Tonghe, director of the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch, and Shen, deputy director of the Water Conservancy Commission, will go to Huaiyin on the 8th of this month for inspection.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Park Temporarily Closed: Preparing for Chrysanthemum Bonsai Exhibition, Works by Kong Zhiqing Will Also Participate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Chrysanthemum Exhibition organized by the Bureau of Public Works Parks and Fields Administration is scheduled to be held at Fuxing Park starting on the 8th. Fuxing Park has been temporarily closed since yesterday to prepare for the event. This reporter made a special visit last night and saw no less than a thousand pots of chrysanthemums of all sizes in the park, dazzling and eye-catching. In the center of Fuxing Park's large lawn, chrysanthemum mountains are piled up with various chrysanthemums, about two zhang (about 6.6 meters) high, with a conical pointed top. In addition, the remains of the recently deceased panda, Xiaoru, have been made into specimens and are also displayed in Fuxing Park, accompanied by a pine tree and many pots of chrysanthemums as a foil, with a snow mountain as the background. The panda is in a leaping pose, resembling a natural picture.

<h3>Ban on Outdoor Neon Lights: Manufacturers' Business Affected, Over 3,000 Firms Jointly Request Continued Opening</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a neon light industry insider who spoke to a reporter, the industry's turnover has decreased by at least half since the authorities banned outdoor neon lights. Other losses are even greater. For example, recently, outdoor neon lights that the industry accepted from customers for installation could not be paid for in most cases after installation because the authorities prohibited them. Currently, the installation of neon lights is limited to indoor use, but there are limited employers, and competition among peers is fierce, and prices have plummeted. If this continues, the factories in the industry will have no choice but to close down. In addition, the businesses of factories and stores in this city have also suffered considerable losses due to the ban on outdoor neon lights. Therefore, more than 3,000 firms have jointly signed their names and affixed their seals, asking the industry to appeal to the authorities to continue to allow outdoor neon lights within the limit of 70% of electricity consumption. According to the investigation, neon lights are not energy-intensive. Each rectifier is equipped with a 50-foot neon tube, and its power consumption is only equal to one hundred incandescent lamps, but the lighting intensity exceeds it. The power consumption of neon light lighting in the city is no more than 300 degrees per day, while the power consumption of ordinary electric lights in the city reaches 67,000 degrees per day. The power consumption of neon lights only accounts for 227th of this amount. Therefore, even if the energy consumption of outdoor neon lights is saved, it will only be 150 degrees per month, which is of no help to factory electricity consumption. On the contrary, the blow to the industry is particularly severe. There are currently 39 companies in the industry, with a total of more than 4,000 employees. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can reconsider opening outdoor neon lights to consider the difficulties of businesses and maintain the livelihoods of thousands of workers.</p>
<h3>Rundall Case Concludes: High Court Declares Appeal Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of German spy suspect Shen Ke accusing Rundall, the manager of the United Press Association's China office, of defamation, the District Court has acquitted Rundall. Shen Ke was unwilling to accept this and appealed to the High Court. Several trials were held, and the two sides debated fiercely, which has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, after the Presiding Judge Zhang Qinglan and Judges Wang Jian and Zhang Shijie took their seats, Judge Zhang ordered Rundall to listen to the judgment and immediately read the main text, saying: "Appeal dismissed." According to the Criminal Procedure Law, only those sentenced to more than five years in prison can appeal to the Supreme Court, while the maximum punishment for defamation is only two years. Therefore, this trial is the final one, and Shen Ke can no longer appeal.</p>
<h3>Recorders of Public Gatherings Not Guilty of Defamation</h3>
<p>The High Court still supported the decision of the first instance court to accept the case, believing that although Shen Ke was an enemy alien and had been prosecuted by the U.S. military court as a war criminal and listed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the list of those to be sent back to his home country, he still had the right to sue and appeal to the court.</p>
<p>At Rundall's request, the court explained the reasons for the judgment, saying: Shen Ke's appeal was dismissed based on Section 4 of Article 311 of the Criminal Law, which states that those who reprint announcements from the central and local governments, public trials in court, and public gatherings are not guilty of defamation, and Rundall's record on April 15 was based on the U.S. military's official announcement. Since Rundall's news came from a U.S. military press conference, whether the content of the news is true or not is irrelevant to this case. In addition, Shen Ke and an agent, lawyer Yao Wudi, were not present at the time of the judgment yesterday.</p>
<h3>Defendant in Railway Bureau Corruption Case Accuses Chen Bozhuang of Recovering Payment for Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xin Dingfu, the legal representative of Yixin Paper Company, the 36th defendant in the corruption case of the Materials Department of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration, hired lawyer Wang Peiji to file a lawsuit in the District Court after being acquitted on October 24, accusing Chen Bozhuang, the director of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration, of failing to pay for the goods and requesting a judgment ordering payment. His complaint stated in brief: The defendant, the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration, ordered 300 reams of 60-pound Daolin paper from the plaintiff on August 20 of this year, at a price of 41,800 yuan per ream, for a total of 12.54 million yuan. The plaintiff delivered all of the above-mentioned Daolin paper on August 24, holding a purchase order signed by the defendant, No. 41. According to the regulations, payment should be made on the day the goods are delivered. However, the defendant repeatedly delayed payment. Until September 10, it forcibly deducted 2,027,000 yuan, so on September 11, it only paid the plaintiff 10,513,000 yuan, owing a loan of 2,027,000 yuan. Repeatedly urging payment was ignored. Therefore, he was forced to file a complaint with the court on September 17, requesting the court to review it and expedite the trial, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the loan at one time, totaling 2,027,000 yuan, and the statutory interest from September 17, the date of the lawsuit, to the end of the execution. He also requested that the court declare provisional execution ex officio, and that the defendant bear the costs of the litigation. The Civil Division 11 of the District Court heard the case yesterday, but the defendant Chen Bozhuang was not present. The court ordered a retrial on the 28th of this month.</p>

<h3>Case of Zang Da's Two Sons Being Killed: U.S. Military Court to Open Trial, Rear Admiral Case Visited Mayor Yesterday and Issued Statement</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Case, commander of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai, returned to Shanghai from Qingdao on the 4th. Yesterday morning (the 5th), he made a special trip to the city government to meet with Mayor Wu Guozhen and made a statement about the progress of the investigation of the Zang Da's two sons case.

<h3>One Page of Facsimile Telegrams: New Facsimile Machine, Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Completes Installation, First Successful Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Western Union" facsimile telegraph machine installed by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has been completely repaired and was successfully tested for the first time within the bureau on the 2nd of this month. Once the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau completes its installation, it can be submitted for approval, and it may be officially opened in Beijing and Shanghai this month. If the Nanjing machinery is installed smoothly, it is planned to be tested during the National Assembly. The new automatic machine of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's facsimile machine can continuously send and receive messages. It was shipped from the United States via India to Kunming before the victory, and then transported to Shanghai via Chongqing. It was severely damaged along the way due to the bumps. There are two types of facsimile telegraph machines. One type is like taking a photo, which needs to be received in a darkroom. What is received is a film, which is then developed. The other type is a true facsimile telegram, which is a true copy when received. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau uses this type. The paper for sending the true facsimile telegram is 7 inches wide and 11 inches long. The handwriting is very clear, even for size 5 font. However, pictures are clearer when they are black and white. Facsimile transmission is very helpful for commercial and industrial communication and can prevent forgery. It can also be used to send true memorabilia to relatives and friends for celebrations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's telegram sending and receiving situation is gradually getting back on track. Currently, Beijing-Shanghai telegrams are transmitted in less than an hour. In addition to the Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou lines for wired telegrams, the two lines affecting Fuzhou are being abandoned. The Wuhan line is being actively reorganized. The wired telegram service to Tianjin will depend on the situation. The wired telegram service to Guangzhou is planned to be routed through Hankou. The bureau has ordered teletypewriters from the United States. After they arrive, sending telegrams will be much more convenient.</p>
<h3>Tax Officials' Attendance Investigation: Identification Can Be Requested</h3>
<p>For the sake of caution, the Municipal Finance Bureau requires all staff dispatched to investigate tax matters to wear the Finance Bureau badge, as well as carry field work permits and deployment orders, indicating their identity and the nature of their mission. It is now learned that the Finance Bureau stipulates that when any of the aforementioned investigators arrive at a business to begin investigating business operations, the business can first request to see various identification documents. If they do not have the aforementioned documents or the work they are doing does not match the assigned mission, the business can refuse the investigation. If there is any impersonation, the police can be notified to arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Property Dispute</p>
<p>Question from Li Ruilin:</p>
<p>My grandfather purchased a residence with a deed from someone named Jia from the clan during his lifetime, more than 60 years ago. Jia has three brothers, and Yi and Bing's family property has long been divided. Jia's heirs have also fled and their whereabouts are unknown. Now Yi and Bing's heirs want to redeem the house from us. Please advise: (1) Can a house purchased with a deed more than 60 years ago still be redeemed? (2) Do Yi and Bing's heirs have the right to redeem the property legally? We would be grateful for your answers in your column!</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) Article 3 of the "Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Mortgages and Pledges" implemented in the Republic of China in 1915 stipulates: "For mortgages and pledges of less than 60 years, regardless of whether there is a redemption period or whether the pledge has been increased or redeemed, if it has been more than 20 years from the date of the contract, the original owner shall be limited to redeeming it within three years after the implementation of these Regulations. If the redemption is not made after the deadline, the original owner shall only be allowed to declare that the property is absolutely forfeited to the pledgee and shall not be allowed to redeem it." Therefore, a property purchased with a deed more than 60 years ago cannot be redeemed according to the law. (2) No.</p>
<p>(2) Bullying by Force</p>
<p>Question from Zheng Xi: In 1938, I rented a front building room at a certain number on Zhongzheng Middle Road from a Taiwanese named Liu. In 1944, Liu used the excuse of turning the front building into a public lounge and forced me to move to the back room, but he allowed me to still set up a bed, table, and chairs in the front building for meals and accommodation. My family has four members, and there are many books, so it was inconvenient to move. He then used the power of the enemy constitution as a threat. Afraid of his power, I moved into the back room without light or air in January of that year. Unexpectedly, after the front building was changed into a lounge, he did not allow me to use it, and discarded the bed, table, and chairs in the patio. I am old and cannot argue with him. After the Japanese surrendered last August, I asked him to allow me to move back to the front building, but he still refused. Friends were indignant and tried to reason with him on April 28, but to no avail. Please advise whether there are any legal provisions that can be cited to seek a reasonable solution. [Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] If the rented premises are indeed the "front building," and the "move to the back room" was indeed forced, and you can provide concrete evidence, you can request the landlord to hand over the "front building" according to Article 423 of the Civil Code. Invalid, you can file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Forcing to live and "discarding things in the patio" if it is done by violence or coercion, if there is a way to prove it, you can report the crime of obstructing freedom to the procuratorate or file a criminal self-suit with the court.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Announces Regulations on Gauze: Guarantees Elimination of Black Market and Stabilization of Market Prices, Manufacturers Should Cooperate Due to High Profits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu invited the heads of various newspapers in the city to a meeting in the City Hall conference room at 3 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yunsheng, Li Zikuan, Zhan Wenhu, Zhao Minheng, Chen Xunyu, Yan Duhe, and Zhu Baiying.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu reported on the handling of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by the Cotton Management Committee.</p>
<p>Regarding the cotton yarn issue, the mayor believes that it must be strictly managed, with unified prices, and distributed to those who truly need it. Regarding the crackdown on the black market for cotton yarn, four specific measures were proposed on the 1st of this month, namely: (1) Regardless of futures or not, from October 25th, all sales will be at the negotiated price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn. For those with differences in previous futures prices, the difference will be refunded or supplemented. (2) Except for futures buyers who have priority, the remaining yarn shall not be refused for sale. (3) Each manufacturer's export volume of cotton yarn shall be reported to the committee for verification. (4) Whether futures or spot goods, the buyer's name, address, and quantity shall be recorded in detail and reported to the committee for verification.</p>
<p>No Difficulty in Refunding or Supplementing</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said that if the above four measures can be effectively implemented, it can be guaranteed that the black market for cotton yarn in this city will disappear in the first ten days of this month. However, after these measures were proposed, manufacturers believed that the first measure needed to be considered because it seemed inconsistent with commercial practice and might cause more disputes, so they repeatedly requested consideration for revision, but it was considered unfounded and could not be established. The mayor's response was: If manufacturers can have better measures to eliminate the black market for cotton yarn in this city in the first ten days of this month, then the first measure may not be strictly enforced. Otherwise, the original measures must be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>Suppressing Prices Starts with Yarn</p>
<p>The mayor believes that if you want to suppress prices, then suppressing yarn prices is essential. There are different opinions on the management of cotton yarn. Some people believe that cotton yarn cannot be managed when supply and demand cannot be balanced. However, the mayor's opinion is the opposite. He believes that it is precisely because demand exceeds supply that it must be managed. The current number of spindles in operation nationwide is 2.5 million, only half of the pre-war number, and the people's need for cotton yarn and cloth is even more urgent after the war. Even if it is restored to the pre-war 5 million spindles, it will still be insufficient. Therefore, the production of yarn must be properly managed.</p>
<p>Management Methods Divided into Three Steps</p>
<p>The management methods can be divided into three steps: (1) Control the production of yarn. This is easy to do because the right to control electricity is in the hands of the city government. (2) Control the price of yarn. The negotiated price of yarn is 1.75 million yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. A lot of research has been done beforehand. In addition to including costs, interest, and legal profits, the profit of development opportunities has also been added to the negotiated price. According to the calculation of this negotiated price, it is estimated that the profit per piece of yarn is quite considerable. If manufacturers still think it is too low, they can only be considered unreasonable. (3) Control the prices of various industrial products. Industries such as machinery dyeing and weaving, knitting, towel and blanket, handkerchief, handmade cotton weaving, and underwear weaving are directly allocated yarn. Before the survey is completed, they are temporarily allocated at 60% of the price. According to the estimated sample survey, the price of cotton yarn is sufficient for application. Since the price of cotton yarn has been stabilized, the price of compound products can be reasonably limited. The current reasonable profit for compound products is set at 10%, but it is only limited to this city. If it is transported and sold to other places, the profit is set at 5%.</p>
<p>The Set Yarn Price Is Not Fixed</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also said: The current yarn price of 1.75 million yuan is not absolutely fixed and can be flexible depending on the rise and fall of cotton prices. But he said that if the above measures can be implemented step by step, he is absolutely confident that "prices will not rise or fall sharply."</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Rise, Foreign Currencies All Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hsiatzhi continued to revolve and rise under the prosperity of the people's hearts. The morning opened at 2.373 million, and this price rose due to public demand, gradually becoming prosperous. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 120 bars at a price of 2.3875 million. After that, there was still no sign of a decline, and demand was still strong. It rose to over 2.39 million near noon. In the afternoon, it continued to rise, and the next-day delivery was once shouted as high as over 2.41 million, but then it fell back due to pressure. As a result, it continued to rise by 18,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 54,000. Silver and silver dollars rose slightly. The private lending market eased slightly, and interest rates were around 15%.</p>
<p>The foreign currency situation was stagnant. The black market for U.S. dollars was between 4,070 yuan and 4,120 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day. Hong Kong currency continued to fall due to the softening of telegraphic transfers. As a result, it fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong telegraphic transfer was even lower yesterday, and there were no sales. Yesterday, 865 yuan was still in short supply. Indian exchange at 1,055 yuan was also a selling situation. British exchange at 14,000 yuan was in supply and there was no demand. The official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was unchanged, and there was no trading.</p>
<h3>Unified Class C Bonds Fall, Miscellaneous Brands Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the major bondholder Fuyuan still had an appetite for Unified Class C bonds. The morning opened at 1,590 yuan. Due to a sale by a household on the fourth floor, it once fell to 1,500 yuan. Fuyuan and others took advantage of the low price to maintain it, and the high price reached 1,670 yuan. The stock market was sluggish, and people's hearts were inevitably hit. It struggled around 1,600 yuan at the close. As a result, it fell by 100 yuan compared to the previous close. Classes A, B, and D rose by 100 yuan. Unified Class E also rose by 70 yuan. The transaction amount was 6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Bulls Take Profits, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Suddenly</h3>
<p>The initial opening of Chinese stocks yesterday was still stable, but people's hearts were not lively. After the opening, they showed slight weakness, and financial stocks immediately absorbed them, which was able to support them, causing the shorts to cover their positions, and the stocks showed their colors and rose. The situation in the middle was uncertain, rising and falling suddenly at high prices. After 11 o'clock, the high price was taken over by the bulls, such as No. 176, to take profits, and the market saw a loosening. The shorts took the opportunity to frequently put pressure on them and began to decline slightly. However, after 11:30, there was a sudden covering of shorts at low prices, and a rebound occurred once. After all, there were not a few who closed with profits. At noon, the shorts panicked again and started selling again. Stock stocks showed slight weakness, but they were still above the morning low price. Compared with the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Meiya each rose by about 3%. Xinhe alone rose by a strong 50%, and the cold stocks rose more than they fell. In the afternoon, the market stabilized again, but the bulls sold to take profits, and arbitrageurs took the opportunity to sell at high prices. After being firm, they gradually weakened, and the market helped to short again, and No. 185 also sold, so Yongsha retreated to around the noon closing price. Qingbang and others maintained them at low prices and gradually announced the market. People's hearts were prosperous, and the market was still firm at the close. As a result, the hot stocks Yongsha rose by 2% compared to the previous close, Xinguang rose by 4%, and Meiya, Qinxing, and Jingfu rose by 50%. Xinhe alone rose by 8%. The cold stocks Xinya, Yonggong, Lian, Wuhe each rose by 50%, and Match Datong Jinglun rose slightly. The rest fell slightly. The total transaction volume was 14.32 million shares. The various stocks outside the market were still calm.</p>
<p>The foreign stocks initially stabilized and then fell back. Except for Yeguang Steel, which was still flat, the other stocks fell slightly. As a result, compared with the previous close, the steel and Yeguang industries were unchanged. The shipping, paper, and Jardine Matheson companies returned to the team by 50%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds and Deferred Delivery: Still Awaiting Approval from the Ministry, the Securities Exchange Held a Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Strictly Orders a Crackdown on Underground Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Since the Ministry of Finance strictly ordered a crackdown on underground banks, more than a dozen underground banks in Nanjing have disappeared, not as active as before. In addition, the lending interest rate is as high as 30%, and the lowest is also around 18%, and there is no guarantee for lending. The market is full of downturns, and it is easy to lend but difficult to recover. The risks are too great. People in the industry are wary. Since the Ministry of Finance approved applications for the resumption of operations by banks and money shops, they all plan to participate in this legitimate way. Therefore, all underground banks will automatically close by the end of this year. The Ministry of Finance recently sent a telegram to the Central Bank ordering a crackdown on usury. The Audit Department of the Central Bank has notified all banks and money shops to comply. It is learned that the authorities have decided to strengthen the crackdown on underground banks, and all banks and money shops that have resumed operations without approval will be ordered to suspend business within a time limit. It is heard that although these banks and money shops that have resumed operations without approval have been cracked down on repeatedly, there are still many existing in the counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces that have resumed operations without authorization. The authorities have decided to order these banks and money shops to suspend business entirely by the end of the year. As for underground banks that do not use the name of a bank or money shop, but only use the name of an enterprise company or even have no name at all, and lend high interest rates, which is a behavior that violates the law, once it is verified, the court will severely punish them according to the law.</p>
<h3>Applications for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Southern China Begin: 340 Qualified Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The Textile Business Management Committee officially started accepting applications for transporting yarn and cloth to South China yesterday. The committee has issued registration cards and application forms to all approved yarn and cloth manufacturers and distributors. Approved manufacturers can apply to the committee with their certificates. According to the committee's announcement, after the committee dispatched personnel to investigate the yarn and cloth manufacturers and distributors registered last month, only 340 of the more than 800 registered manufacturers had complete content equipment and had previously operated export businesses. There were 210 yarn and cloth factories and 130 distributors. As for the yarn and cloth transported to South China, according to the pre-war production figures, the monthly export of cotton yarn is 4,967 pieces and cotton cloth is 110,647 pieces.</p>
<p>In order to supervise the import of yarn and cloth in the four ports of Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou in South China, the committee will send special commissioners to the four places and will go there soon.</p>
<h3>Coking Coal's Destination Widens</h3>
<p>Since the price of white coal lumps has risen frequently, most users' purchasing power has weakened, and they have successively adopted other fuels as substitutes. Coking coal should be purchased by most users in a timely manner. The current actual sales volume of coking coal has exceeded 3,000 metric tons per month. In addition to the local use of anthracite coal chips from Zhongxing to be refined by indigenous methods and the products of the Songjiang Coking Coal Plant, coking coal mainly relies on imports from other ports, with Hankou Pingxiang Coking Coal, Lantian Coking Coal, and Xuzhou Jingxing Coking Coal being the main sources. In addition to the Qingzhong Zhongxing refined by local indigenous methods, which still sells for a high price of 800,000 yuan, the price of other coking coal is 450,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan, only half the price of white coal lumps.</p>
<h3>Wool Yarn Price Lower Than Cost: Review Meeting Decides on Wholesale and Retail Profits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Wool Yarn Price Review Committee held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday. Chen Qi'en and Deng Zhonghe from the Wool Textile Dyeing Industry Association, Shen Laizhou and Zhang Yiping from the Wool Yarn Business Association, Pan Shihao from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Director Gu Bingyuan attended. Regarding the manufacturing cost, based on actual investigation, it was reviewed again. Representatives of the Business Association reported the market price, roughly saying that the selling price is falling. The current price of high-quality goods is 58,000 yuan, first-class goods are 48,000 yuan, and ordinary goods are 132,000 to 36,000 yuan, which is the retail price per pound, which is very limited compared to the manufacturer's cost. Representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also pointed out that the recent low market price is indeed lower than the cost, and the review should be particularly cautious, advocating not to stipulate a fixed selling price for the time being, which was agreed by all. Then, the legal profit was discussed, and it was agreed that the wholesale profit should be 15% and the retail profit should be 20%. Later, the issue of the burden of commodity tax was also discussed by all parties. According to representatives of the Industrial Association, they are still striving for tax exemption. If tax exemption is not obtained, there will be problems with the burden. It is heard that a certain wool yarn factory has produced various wool yarns such as General, Red Beauty, and Green Beauty, which will be sold soon, and the grades were also reviewed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Raw Oil Drops Sharply, Rice, Wheat, and Coarse Grains Are Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market registered 12,000+ shih of goods. Both northern and southern japonica rice fell by 1,000 yuan. White rice was sluggish and fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The negative impact was strong and resolute, and it was weak. Indica rice was firm in the producing areas and remained stable. Wheat also returned to flat. There was a slight source of flour from the inland, asking for 300-500 yuan. The limited retail price of miscellaneous brand flour is 20,500 yuan per bag. It is recently heard that the Northeast will have a large batch of soybeans arriving in Shanghai, and people's hearts are weak, and the price has dropped by 300-500 yuan. Soybean cakes are being procured from Shantou and Xiamen, but the factory is still supplying a lot, and they are returning to a small 100-200 yuan. Due to the surge in goods from Qingdao today, oil mills have eased their stomachs, raw oil has dropped sharply by 6,000-7,000 yuan, soybean oil and Qing oil are flat and stable, and sesame oil is similar. Corn has decreased by 500-600 yuan. There are not many red grains arriving, and they are still firm. Fujian help is inquiring about broad beans. The source is still scarce, and the price has risen by 1,000 yuan. There is still a demand for raw peanuts from Nanyang and Taichai, and they are soaring again, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. There is not much sesame in stock, and it continues to rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Plain Thick Wool Is Popular</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the warm weather, the actual sales of wool have not progressed in various places. Although there are various beneficial buying news one after another, the price has always been stable. At the tea party yesterday, only one type of plain thick wool was popular. The estimated price for the top number was 95,000 yuan per yard, the second number was 80,000 yuan, and the third number was 65,000 yuan. Customers were adding a lot to their purchases, and the factory's goods were not being produced. Very few imported goods were transported, and there was a sign of scarcity in the market.</p>
<h3>New Tung Oil from Eastern Zhejiang Enters the Market; Increased Costs Lead to Price Hikes</h3>
<p>New tung oil from Jinlan and other areas in Eastern Zhejiang has entered the market, with daily receipts of ten to twenty pieces. The price is 100,000 yuan per shi dan (unit of weight). Recent news indicates that the China Plant Oil Factory has handled thirty pieces at 100,300 yuan, delivered in Hangzhou. It is said that the factory still has an appetite for it. Because the new product is just appearing, the supply is intermittent, making it difficult to purchase in large quantities. However, the market already has a standard, and it will be difficult to see prices ease unless there is a surge in supply. Moreover, this winter's yield is lower than last year's. Because various places are waiting for new products, future sales will definitely not be weaker than in previous years, and it will be difficult to find cheaper prices. As for the Jiaxing area of Western Zhejiang, the yield seems to be better than last year's, and seeds have also appeared. The market price is generally around 30,000 yuan per shi, which means the cost of tung oil must be above 100,000 yuan. Therefore, although some inland traders initially sold it at 75,000 yuan per shi dan, they quickly increased the price to 90,000 yuan, and recently it has increased to 100,000 yuan, with few sellers. Initially, various firms in this port hoped for lower prices, but after observing the environment recently, it seems that prices are more likely to rise than fall. They want to place advance orders, but there are no sellers, which is a common sentiment. Yesterday, the black market trading of rayon was still good, with semi-matte goods being the most popular, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. No. 120 old-fashioned Tianqiao glossy goods had a flat asking price in the morning, but in the afternoon, because the new-fashioned goods rose to 3.17 million yuan, with the highest bid being 200,000 yuan, they also followed suit, increasing by 50,000 yuan. As a result, the old-fashioned goods were 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and the new-fashioned goods were 100,000 yuan higher. No one inquired about No. 120 miscellaneous brand glossy goods and No. 150 glossy goods. The asking price was the same as the previous day. The factory prices were as stable as the previous day, but the trading was very quiet. The silk market situation remains sluggish. Yesterday, quilt covers fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Hua Jin crepe was priced at 3,200 to 3,300 yuan, and rayon feather yarn was priced at 3,400 to 3,500 yuan, depending on the quality of the goods.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Both Show Slight Activity; Factories Pushing Out Fine Yarn, Which Remains Sluggish; Cloth Prices Fall Below Cost, Sales Slightly Improve</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend upward. Customers from Jingwu and inland areas showed strong interest, mostly targeting medium and small 20-count yarns. There was also a significant amount of 20-count heavyweight yarn. As a result, various brands rose by another 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Due to the fact that many duplicate factories were pushing out Silver Moon, Lima, Blue Phoenix, and other brands of 32-count fine yarn and 42-count double-strand thread, and the sales were particularly sluggish, the market price showed no progress. Although the authorities have the confidence to stabilize the yarn market, most of the allocated goods are for forward delivery. If autumn sales see another surge, the spot goods may not be sufficient for sales, and there is a high possibility of a rebound in prices.</p>
<p>Although the listed prices of cotton cloth from Fangjian have declined, sales in this street and in areas such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have been slightly stronger, showing a trend of firmness. It has been found that the recent sharp decline in cloth prices has caused customers to take a wait-and-see attitude, and counter sales in this street are also extremely sparse. Recently, the market price has fallen below cost, coupled with high interest rates, resulting in significant losses for weaving manufacturers. However, it is currently the sales season, and the sluggish sales of cotton cloth seem unreasonable according to past experience. Therefore, the general psychology is that if the weather turns cold, sales may increase, and there may be a turnaround.</p>
<h3>Fire Machine Cotton Cannot Be Sold, Cotton Farmers Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The coastal area of ​​Pudong belongs to sandy fields with salty soil, which is not conducive to rice cultivation. Therefore, the farmers there mainly grow miscellaneous grains, peanuts, and cotton, commonly known as "Fire Machine Cotton," which is exclusively sold to various yarn factories in this city as raw material for spinning 16-count and lower yarns. This year, a large number of foreign cottons were imported, and yarn factories used foreign cotton, rejecting local cotton, taking advantage of its lower price and higher quality. The "Fire Machine Cotton" produced in Pudong cannot be sold at all. In addition, this year's continuous autumn rain has resulted in poor harvests, with each mu yielding only seventy to eighty jin, which at the current price, is only about 30,000 yuan. Farmers have worked hard all year round, and not only is there no compensation for seeds, fertilizers, and labor, but tenant farmers have no way to pay their land rent. The bankruptcy of the countryside is imminent. Although the government has agricultural loans, cotton farmers who have no access cannot obtain them. Even if they do obtain them, how will they repay them in the future? The impact will inevitably lead to a decrease in farmers' interest in planting cotton, and the cotton fields will inevitably decrease next year. Yarn factories are feeling the lack of raw materials, but the cotton of cotton farmers cannot even be sold. This is also one of the contradictory phenomena in today's economic world.</p>
<h3>New Needle Eyebrow Tea Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The tea market has been very flat for domestic sales recently. For foreign sales, Qimen aged floral-scented tea is still selling smoothly, and the buying momentum for high-grade red tea from English estates is also unabated. New green tea is in short supply because exporting firms are rushing to meet shipping deadlines, so they are scrambling to make up the shortfall. As a result, the market is very strong. In addition, the supply of new Wenzhou needle eyebrow tea is relatively slow, and demand is even higher, so the price has risen sharply. As a result, each dan opened at 100,000 yuan, a jump of more than 15,000 yuan compared to before. [Report from our newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The price of gold in Tianjin and Beiping has risen again this week due to the influence of the current situation and currency value. Compared with the beginning of the week, it has risen by 10,000 yuan. The price of gold in Tianjin has even exceeded 250,000 yuan. Silver has also risen in tandem. The price at the beginning of the week was 2,200 yuan per tael, and it rose to 2,400 yuan at the weekend. It is said that most of the silver is transshipped through Tianjin and Shanghai to Hong Kong, Bombay, and London. Because there is a rumor of cracking down on the black market for US dollars, its price has been hovering around 4,000 yuan. Grain prices are slightly lower, but still particularly high compared to Shanghai. Flour is 37,000 yuan per bag, rice is 790 yuan per jin, and cotton cloth prices are still relatively stable. Because coal from Jingxing cannot come north and the Ping Sui Railway is also damaged after the robbery, the price of fuel is still firm. Because Zhangjiakou has been opened, the price of meat has decreased, and the price of cigarettes is still stable.</p>
<h3>Although There Are Many Joint Shopping Centers, Actual Sales Are Not Strong</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, American-style stall joint markets and domestic goods markets have sprung up in this city. The goods displayed are all sold at discounted prices to attract customers. However, according to surveys, the actual business of these collective markets is not booming. Moreover, the establishment of some shopping centers has speculative overtones. However, it has a profound impact on the business of general department stores. The peak season for department stores throughout the year should be in the past two months. However, business has not improved recently. The average daily sales of ordinary stores can only afford the salaries of employees at most. Fortunately, the business of department stores is mostly stable, so in the current chorus of high interest rates, sluggish business, and weak purchasing power, they can barely maintain the situation, hoping that business will be better in the future.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Falls Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] Today, the cotton market was affected by selling in New Orleans, and cotton futures were forced to fall. Most of the goods sold were bought by yarn factories. The closing price fell by 2.5 to 3 yuan per bale.</p>
<h3>World Cotton Production Totals Two-Thirds of Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] According to estimates by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the world's total cotton production this year is 22,050,000 bales (500 pounds per bale), while the average for the years 1936 to 1940 was 30,800,000 bales. Therefore, this year's production is two-thirds of the pre-war level. Last year was one of the lowest cotton production years in twenty-three years, and this year it has increased by 1.5 million bales compared to last year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Memphis, Tennessee, 4th] Georgia Congressman Pace warned U.S. cotton farmers, while discussing the future of U.S. cotton and price controls at a House subcommittee meeting, not to collapse production to more than 12.5 million bales in 1947. Pace said that if cotton farmers do not limit cotton production next year, they may not avoid repeating the overproduction after 1937.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper, Beiping, 5th] The Executive Yuan recently announced that Yao Congwu, director of the History Department of Peking University, would be the president of National Henan University.

The Ministry of Education sent someone to Beiping a few days ago to urge him to take office, but Yao politely declined. Therefore, the Ministry of Education may need to select another candidate for the president of Henan University.</p>

The provisions of the original regulations apply to areas where National Identification Cards have not yet been widely issued. Now that National Identification Cards have been widely issued in this city, civil servants and their families residing in this city who have not yet obtained National Identification Cards, newly hired staff, or those who have obtained them but have been damaged or lost them, should all follow the procedures for issuing National Identification Cards by this government. The relevant regulations have been reviewed and circulated to the affiliated departments for their information.</p>
<h3>Dredging Riverbanks in the Thirteenth District</h3>
<p>And Establishment of a Mediation Committee</p>
<p>The Thirteenth District (Putuo) District Office noted that in the 26th and 27th Bao, Yaoshui Lane area, there was an original riverbank that could connect to the Suzhou River. Due to years of neglect in dredging, coupled with residents dumping garbage, it has become clogged, not only hindering sanitation but also affecting fire prevention. The district office has requested the Municipal Engineering Bureau's Ditch Engineering Department to mobilize labor service for dredging and has drafted service regulations for the two Bao to comply with. It is reported that work will commence soon. The supervision and dredging work will be assisted and provided by the Ditch Engineering Department.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Thirteenth District's Mediation Committee previously held its first district representative meeting, electing Zhu Qizhen, Bian Zenghua, Tang Xikang, Liu Gongfu, Shen Zhijing, Jin Huating, Yang Haishan, Jing Song'an, and Yang Leshan as committee members. It has been learned that the District Office convened an establishment meeting the day before yesterday and elected Zhu Qizhen as the chairman of the committee. The Twenty-first District (Xinshijie) District Office, in response to the school dedication for birthday celebration movement, convened a meeting of Bao chiefs and full-time staff in the District Office meeting room at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. District Chief Zhu Shuren presided, and principals of Municipal Qimei Elementary School and Hongbei Elementary School attended. It was decided to follow the chairman's instructions to raise funds, absolutely avoiding apportionment. All donations should be based on voluntary initiative, and a Shanghai Twenty-first District School Dedication for Birthday Celebration Encouragement Committee will be organized first before discussing further action.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The district's mediation committee has also been established, with Zhang Guoxian elected as the chairman.</p>
<h3>Replacement of Bao Chiefs in the Sixteenth District</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiang, Bao chief of the 25th Bao in the Sixteenth District (Hongkou), has been dismissed from his position. The vacancy will be filled by Zhang Zhuchuan, the deputy Bao chief of the same Bao, and the District Office has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>

<h3>The Chairman's Birthday Celebrated All Over the Capital</h3>
<p>— October 31st, Nanjing Dispatch from our Special Correspondent, Ding Kuanghua</p>
<p>Today is Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday, and joyous cheers fill every corner of the country. The birthday celebration movement has long been underway. The central authorities believe that the Chairman has dedicated his entire life to the Party and the nation. To honor his remarkable achievements, following the century-long education plan, it was decided that dedicating schools would be the sole birthday gift. The Nanjing Municipal Government took the lead by dedicating sixty schools. From the newspapers, we see that the achievements of various provinces and cities in dedicating schools are staggering. Private schools, in particular, voluntarily canceled their long-standing historical names and renamed themselves "Zhongzheng" schools, demonstrating the greatness of the Chairman's virtue and influence. The Nanjing Municipal Party Committee also launched a campaign for all party members to donate a Zhongzheng Library to lay the foundation for public education in the capital. As the birthday approached, the gift-giving expanded daily. To save manpower, material resources, and financial resources, Chairman Chiang announced on the 30th that he would decline birthday celebrations, demonstrating the Chairman's noble and simple personality. The entire city's birthday wishes at the Lishi Society, the Central Party Headquarters' signing of respects, the National Government's enthusiastic congratulations, the Nanjing students' grand chorus of ten thousand people... all echoed in the Chairman's ears. To reduce the busy social activities of civil and military officials, Chairman Chiang had to take a trip to the suburbs to avoid the celebrations.</p>
<h3>The Birthday Star Arose Early for Family Birthday Greetings</h3>
<p>On this day, the birthday star woke up early, and family birthday greetings were, of course, unavoidable. The two sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren gathered happily. Committee Member Kong Xiangxi also made a special trip from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 30th to offer birthday greetings. After 8:00 AM, the Chairman drove around the National Government, rested at his official residence for a while, and then took a trip to the suburbs with his wife and Commander Ma and his wife to avoid the celebrations. A special train with six carriages was prepared on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, decorated extremely luxuriously, with "Longevity" characters visible everywhere inside the carriages. The Chairman and his party boarded the train at Hepingmen, accompanied by Director Yu Jishi, Director Chen Bozhuang, and the famous American writer Ruth. The Chairman smiled and accepted the cheers of the people along the way, taking a short trip to Taihu Lake in Wuxi, and returned to Nanjing by the same train in the evening.</p>
<p>Today, every corner of Nanjing is enveloped in a birthday celebration atmosphere. National flags flutter on the streets, firecrackers crackle continuously, and the Central Broadcasting Station, Yishi Broadcasting Station, and Youth Broadcasting Station broadcast birthday celebration programs all day long. A giant jade portrait of the Chairman, created by the National Defense Department's Information Bureau, stands tall on the streets, becoming a treasure most appreciated by the citizens. The clocks on major thoroughfares are inlaid with "Longevity" characters circling on neon lights. Several major shopping malls have erected colorful arches with the inscription "May the Rivers and Mountains Share Longevity," appearing both exquisite and majestic. Noodle restaurants are particularly busy, with ordinary people eating bowls of longevity noodles on this day to wish Chairman Chiang a long life, relying on the Chairman's blessings, a meaning that is also very profound. Cars are covered with birthday slogans, driving back and forth in a flurry of activity, adding to the liveliness of the Chairman's birthday.</p>
<h3>Central Figures Gather to Sign Birthday Greetings and Pay Respects</h3>
<p>The birthday hall arranged by the National Government today is simple and solemn. Starting at 8:00 AM, central figures began to sign birthday greetings. Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang and Acting Chief Aide-de-Camp Wu Siyu led all staff members to sign birthday greetings in accordance with the decision. President Dai Jitao, with his white hair, and Vice President Zhou Zhongyue jointly arrived at the National Government around 9:00 AM, signing their names on the specially prepared red birthday book to offer congratulations. After 10:00 AM, foreign envoys arrived one after another, all with smiling expressions, writing historical "Longevity" characters and birthday gifts on the signature book. Particularly noteworthy was the birthday celebration of the Mongolian and Tibetan representatives. Wearing their unique attire, they signed different characters. The National Government specially set up one hundred tables for the birthday feast, inviting all the participants to celebrate, and the eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, personally expressed his gratitude to each guest.</p>
<p>Today, the Central Party Headquarters hung a large "Longevity" character in the center of the auditorium, with pine and cypress trees symbolizing longevity placed in the center, adorned with red and green electric lights, appearing exceptionally brilliant. Mr. Wu Zhihui, an elder statesman of the Party, arrived the earliest, being the first to sign his name to pay respects. He was particularly excited today, touring the auditorium. When he saw the "Thousand Autumns" longevity area presented by the People's Representative of Dangtu County, he nodded for a long time. Starting at 9:00 AM, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Chen Guofu, Zhang Lisheng, Liang Hancao, and others arrived one after another, signing birthday greetings, presenting birthday essays, and reading birthday greetings, keeping the staff busy. Party workers in Nanjing and representatives from various places in the suburbs of Nanjing flocked to offer their congratulations.</p>
<h3>Crowds Gathered at Lishi Society, 100,000 Citizens Enthusiastically Participated in Signing</h3>
<p>The capital's birthday hall for celebrations from all walks of life was set up in the auditorium of the Lishi Society. Therefore, Yixian Bridge on Zhongshan East Road to Huangpu Road was crowded with traffic and people, the only lively place in the capital today. To maintain order inside the birthday hall, vehicles were not allowed inside. Twelve tables were placed at the entrance, where everyone offering birthday greetings first had to sign their name. Birthday greetings were offered in order of arrival, with sixty people forming a group, and the receptionists were extremely busy organizing their ranks. Each person was given a square "Longevity" character made of red silk with golden characters as a souvenir. The arrangement of the hall was as follows: a "Longevity" character neon light was suspended in the center, and the four characters "May You Live Ten Thousand Years" were displayed above the birthday stage. On the side hung large colored pictures of the Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity and the Queen Mother Offering Longevity, embroidered in Xiang embroidery. Mr. Wu Zhi, the old gentleman, personally wrote a couplet: "Starting with Genghis Khan conquering the West, Washington leading North America again," which was also displayed here. At 8:00 AM sharp, the capital's birthday celebration ceremony began. Mayor Ma, Hong Lanyou, and Yuan Shouqian represented the Chairman in accepting the ceremony, and Huang Renlin returned the greetings, wearing a blue robe and black mandarin jacket, making him appear even more stout and kind. Then, Ma Yuanfang, Xiao Zanyu, Chen Yuguang, and Shen Zumu, representing 830,000 citizens of Nanjing, dedicated schools and libraries as gifts of eternal significance to celebrate Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday. Mr. Chen Guofu's father, Qinshi, also came to offer birthday congratulations, supported by two people. Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Lu Zhonglin, Kong Xiangxi, Huang Zhenqiu, Zhou Zhirou, Zhu Shiming, Zhang Zhen, and others also came to offer birthday greetings. The Chairman's eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, nodded and shook hands with the guests, looking joyful and drawing the most attention. After the birthday greetings, everyone flocked to another room to view photos of the Chairman's life. The Lishi Society's auditorium was filled with more than a thousand precious photos of the Chairman's life over the past sixty years. Entering the room, the reporter first saw an enlarged heroic image of the Chairman during the Northern Expedition, with a sword across his waist, his spirit swallowing rainbows. We looked up at the Chairman's majesty, which was still undiminished. Looking at the photos of the Chairman's life, it was clear how much he loved the people. Leading the Northern Expedition, leading the War of Resistance, comforting soldiers and civilians, and caring for his comrades were all vividly depicted on paper. And the Chairman's family reunion photos were particularly appreciated by the citizens. From morning to night, the reporter never left for a moment, only seeing the signature papers being changed again and again, piling up thickly. According to the reporter's lowest estimate, there were more than 50,000 people, and with children and women included, the actual number of people offering birthday greetings was definitely more than 100,000, and certainly not less.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Supplements Flying All Over the Streets</h3>
<p>The capital's newspapers have been collecting the Chairman's past life photos for the publication of birthday commemorative supplements. Some started working three months ago, drafting articles and competing fiercely, creating a white-hot competition. Today, everything has been revealed. All newspapers have expanded their pages today, with birthday celebrations as the main theme. Early in the morning, newspapers were flying all over the streets, and citizens scrambled to buy them. Although each newspaper printed several thousand or even tens of thousands of copies, they were sold out by 3:00 PM. The Shanghai newspapers brought by China National Aviation Corporation were also snapped up, and even existing subscribers had to be arranged for separate delivery. The long-established Shen Bao published five large pages today, including several precious photos of Chairman Chiang's life, which were most popular with readers. The competition in the cultural world is also a good story in the midst of the birthday celebrations. Today, the sky is high and the air is crisp, the sun is bright and the breeze is gentle, symbolizing the Chinese Republic lasting for billions of years, and Chairman Chiang living ten thousand years.</p>

<h3>Going to the Northern Jiangsu Front</h3>
<p>— October 25th, Liangduo Dispatch from our Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>Since the Yunhe Line was reopened, the situation in Northern Jiangsu is nearing a stage of complete suppression.</p>
<p>Following the start of the war on the Fan Gongdi embankment, the reporter, entrusted with the task by the newspaper, made a trip to the east line.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, I spent the whole day busy with vehicles. There were certainly no passenger cars available; moreover, the work of suppressing the Hai-Tai Line on both sides had not yet been completed. For the sake of safety, it was necessary to request assistance from the military.</p>
<p>Since the 83rd Division was the main force in the east line war, a rear headquarters of the division was set up in Taixian, specializing in supplying provisions to the front. The reporter's first step was to go to the headquarters. According to Section Chief Lin of the Adjutant's Office, vehicles were available, but there was no guarantee when they would depart. If there was any need at the front, they could set off at any time. He promised to notify me if any vehicles were leaving. Although this was not yet certain, news reporters need to seize the moment completely. If it was delayed for another three or five days, and once Dongtai was recovered, the trip would lose its timeliness. Therefore, the reporter also consulted with Staff Officer Wang of the 148th Brigade of the 25th Division. The Staff Officer introduced Instructor Hu of the Brigade Station to plan for the reporter, but they did not meet twice; by the time it was dusk, just as I was anxiously wondering, the Adjutant's Office of the 83rd Division suddenly sent a notice that a special car would depart for the front line at 6:00 AM the next morning. Upon seeing it, my heart was filled with joy, and I felt boundless comfort.</p>
<p>I got up at four o'clock on the morning of the 23rd, and in the light wind and dim morning stars, the reporter yearned for the flames of war on the eastern battlefield, one hundred and sixty miles away.</p>
<p>Arriving at the division headquarters at six o'clock, the vehicle was held up by other matters and did not depart until ten o'clock. The vehicle was driven by Deputy Company Commander Lian of the Motor Vehicle Company of the Division ("Uncle A", as he has been nicknamed for nearly ten years, addressed that way by everyone from the Division Commander to the soldiers), and the director Luo of the political department of the 56th regiment of the 19th brigade was also traveling with him.</p>
<p>The car moved at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. On the way, we encountered many returning troops, striding forward with chests out and guns on their shoulders. Someone in the car said: "This is truly a manifestation of the awakening of the people's consciousness". At 10:31 AM, we arrived at Jiangyan, a place that the reporter had visited three times in three months. The first time was just after its recovery; the second time was after the Magou battle, when I followed Staff Officer Wu of the 108th Brigade of the 25th Division with brother Hang Zhou to inspect; today was my third visit here, and the car sped past, making it difficult to take it all in. I thought it must have progressed and prospered a bit!</p>
<p>Heading east from Jiangyan, it took ten minutes to reach Baimi. This section of the road is still frequently sabotaged by the Communist army. Fortunately, the organization of road protection is very complete, and repairs are made whenever sabotage occurs, so traffic is not cut off and military transport is not hindered. However, there are still unavoidable bumps and unevenness on the road, and the car jolts violently as it passes over them.</p>
<p>After passing Qutang, we arrived at Hai'an at 11:20 AM and stopped briefly. We ate some refreshments at a small snack shop by the roadside; "flies swarmed", and it was unbearably dirty. Director Luo, who was traveling with me, had reached his destination, and we shook hands to say goodbye. At 11:50 AM, we advanced north from Hai'an. After the car passed the west entrance of Hai'an, a large Temple of the King was left with only the two stone lions in front of the mountain gate still intact, the rest of the houses, whether the Great Buddha Hall or the meditation rooms, were either broken or collapsed, having been "baptized" by the cannons of Western religion. The outskirts of Hai'an were surrounded by earthen forts and covered with caltrops, showing a tense state of preparedness, and here the reporter even thought of the cruel scene of the Communist army's all-out attack on the 19th!</p>
<p>At 12:05 PM, we arrived at Maijiaji. Traveling in the same direction as the car were also many Cantonese soldiers of a certain division. Now it is the tenth month of the lunar calendar, and the plum blossoms on the ridges should be budding. For eight years, they have been fighting across the north and south of the Yangtze River. Now, in coastal Northern Jiangsu, they are raising the banner of punishing the wicked and relieving the people. I wonder if they ever think of the plum blossoms in their hometown?</p>
<p>North of Maijiaji, the Communist army left behind many fortifications that had only recently been built. Near Fuan, there was even a small airfield, which the National Army and residents were working together to clean up.</p>
<p>We arrived at Fuan at 12:25 PM. Ruined walls stood opposite each other, and almost every house in the town was scarred by bullets; the displaced victims of the disaster were dismantling the remaining houses, not knowing whether it was because they were uninhabitable and it would be cleaner to demolish them, or whether they were preparing to rebuild them. Many relief vehicles from a certain unit, painted with blood-red crosses, were carrying out post-disaster relief work. This was the result of four days and nights of shelling.</p>
<p>Originally, our intended destination was Fuan. However, in order to cooperate with the development of the war situation, the headquarters of the 83rd Division had already been moved, so the car continued to advance north. At 12:40 PM, we reached the outskirts of Anfeng, and the reporter could clearly hear the sound of artillery fire from the front line.</p>
<p>The streets of Anfeng are very narrow, and there is a bridge on the Tong-Yu Highway east of the town that was destroyed by the Communist army and has not yet been repaired. Therefore, the car had to pass through the center of the town. More than a dozen cars were crowded on the street. Our car could not back up, so we had to signal the car in front to retreat, while we temporarily stopped on the side of the road. At this time, Section Chief Wang of the Division Headquarters' Military Affairs Office was going to Hai'an, and we met on the roadside. Section Chief Wang warmly told me about the war situation on the front line and said: "All the officers and soldiers of the 83rd Division will give you, 'the number one reporter,' a very welcome and spiritually boundless comfort." It took more than half an hour for the car to finally pass. By the time we reached the division headquarters, it was already 1:30 PM. General Li Tianxia was commanding on the front line, and upon hearing the news, he specially sent Senior Staff Officer Chang Xiaode to greet the reporter, and I followed him to the front line to meet the Division Commander.</p>
<p>It had been three months since I had last seen Division Commander Li. Upon seeing each other, the Division Commander was very happy. When talking about the article I wrote, "General Li Tianxia's Demeanor", he laughed and said, "It's too exaggerated". But he also admitted that the people of Taixian and him felt a special closeness with each other!</p>
<p>This time, the National Army advanced north from Hai'an, and Division Commander Li personally commanded on the front line every day. He said to Senior Staff Officer Chang and the reporter: "In this kind of war, what is the point if the officer in charge doesn't go to the front?"</p>
<p>The forward command post was very simple, set up in a grass shed. Two large tables served as desks, and telephones and military maps were placed on them. The fate of tens of thousands of people on the Fan Gongdi was decided in this very simple setting.</p>
<p>Senior Staff Officer Chang was in his forties, and his leg was injured in the Battle of Wanjialing outside Wuhan in 1938 and is still a bit lame. He is with the Division Commander all day long, advising on military matters, and is a major figure in the forward command post. In order to assist in the advance work and enhance the effectiveness of the war, the Air Force Headquarters specially dispatched a squadron of aircraft for use in Northern Jiangsu, so next to the command post, there was an Air Force liaison team. The team was set up in a truck and followed the command post at all times. The Air Force Headquarters also sent technical personnel here to be responsible for managing the liaison between the land and the air force.</p>
<p>To the right front of the forward command post, there was a gate. The Communist army had written "Liberation Gate" on it, with a couplet on both sides: "Punish the wicked and express righteousness, consolidate the country's foundation through production." The Division Commander instructed me to take a photo and then ordered the soldiers to paint it over.</p>
<h3>Only Three Li Away from the Fire Line, the Situation on the Street is Abnormally Quiet</h3>
<p>Anfeng was recovered on the morning of the 22nd, and the reporter arrived in Anfeng only the next day. But the situation on the street was abnormally quiet, and the children were rolling coins freely; if it were not for the troops coming and going, you would not know that this was a town that had just been recovered for a day and was less than three li away from the front line.</p>
<p>At about 4:00 PM, the reporter returned to his residence to rest. The residence was a private house of a Mr. Zhu that was borrowed by the Adjutant's Office of the Division. The homeowner was very good and provided us with meticulous hospitality, and we could ask for anything we needed. The reporter brought a few Shenbao newspapers from Taixian, and he gladly borrowed them to read, sighing and saying, "I haven't seen this kind of newspaper in seven or eight years!" They felt that the articles "Attacking the Heart with a Lone Sword" and "General Li Tianxia's Demeanor" in the special feature column of this newspaper on October 13 were particularly interesting.</p>
<p>The reporter wanted to inquire about the situation during the Communist army's occupation from them, but they insisted on not saying anything, and no amount of persuasion was effective. They only said: "The National Army must severely punish some people who have been helping the tigers!" Hearing the words of this group of strangers and yet familiar compatriots, the reporter felt endless emotion!</p>
<p>In the evening, I chatted with a section chief Geng of the Adjutant's Office. He told me: "When I first came here, I wanted to contact the district office about something. I asked an old man where the district office was. Do you know what he said to me? He said to me: 'Your district office is over there, our district office (referring to the Communist Party organization) has already moved!'" May I ask, what kind of fact is this? Originally, the villagers have simple knowledge, and the occupation has been too long, so this situation is inevitable; however, what plans will the authorities have to engage in "re-education" for them?</p>
<p>Today the war was quiet, with only intermittent artillery fire. On the front line, Division Commander Li excitedly pointed to the military map and told the reporter: "Liangduo has entered the range of the artillery, and our troops advancing from the direction of Zhengdong have also crossed Shinian and reached a certain place. The troops on the right wing are confronting the Communist army across the river, and it is very likely that we will successfully take Liangduo tomorrow." The largest stronghold south of Dongtai is only Liangduo. The reporter is preparing to step into the gateway to Fan Gongdi—Dongtai—from here.</p>

<h3>The Evolution of Greece: A Struggle Unfolds Between the US, Soviet Union, and England, While Internal Strife Continues</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Recent developments in Greece indicate that although the public referendum on September 1st determined the country's course, it did not alleviate the tense situation in Greece. Instead, the struggle among powerful nations to control Greece has intensified. The United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union continue to vie for this peninsula, which, despite its poverty, is strategically crucial.</p>
<p>Recently, the new American aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and its escort warships visited Athens for a "goodwill" visit, showcasing American naval power. The British Mediterranean Fleet is also scheduled to conduct exercises off the Greek coast. While the War Office is drafting plans for the withdrawal of British troops from Greece, the British navy can still control the situation in Greece.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has no troops or warships in the Mediterranean, but it is using its diplomatic weapons. The Soviet ambassador to Greece was recalled, expressing dissatisfaction with the results of the referendum. At the Paris Peace Conference, the Soviet delegation vigorously attacked the Greek government and supported Albania's and Bulgaria's claims against Greece. At the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union also demanded that countries report on the troops they stationed in non-enemy territories, which of course included British troops stationed in Greece.</p>
<p>Within Greece, left-wing parties believe the results of the referendum were unfair. The volatile civil war between royalists and pro-communists continues, resulting in numerous casualties each week.</p>
<p>Strategic Importance: England and America Determined Not to Relinquish</p>
<p>The great powers attach such importance to Greece because it is the only country in the Balkans not controlled by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies are determined to extend their influence to Greece, while the British, Americans, and the Greek royalist government are determined to prevent Soviet influence from encroaching. The struggle is extremely intense.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the northern border region of Greece is a cradle of political conflict, inhabited by a mixture of Albanians, Greeks, Yugoslavs, Macedonians, and Bulgarians. The ideology promoted by the Soviet Union has divided these mixed races into two camps. Slavs, Albanians, and some Greeks advocate for the organization of a Slavic alliance led by Tito of Yugoslavia, with its territory extending from the Danube River to the Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p>This vast group would be led by Moscow, and Greece is determined to prevent the realization of this pan-Balkan dream. The ethnic minorities within Greece are useful tools for Tito and his Soviet allies. In retaliation, the Greek minorities within Albania are extremely useful for the Greek royalist leaders who promote nationalism.</p>
<p>Greece's eastern coastline is extremely long, and the islands in the Aegean Sea are scattered, controlling the entrance to the Mediterranean. In that area, Thessaloniki is an excellent naval base. This important port has long been a breeding ground for pan-Balkan activities, and now Bulgaria is eager to seize it to gain a "window" on the Aegean Sea. If Thessaloniki falls into the hands of a Slavic country, then Eastern European countries could gain a naval base from which they could sail directly into the Mediterranean overnight.</p>
<p>The Trieste Issue: Crucial to Greece</p>
<p>At the same time, the struggle between Yugoslavia and Italy for Trieste (in reality, a struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States and England) is also extremely important to Greece. Ships entering and leaving the Port of Trieste must pass through the west coast of Greece. Albania, which is friendly to the Soviet Union, controls the northern part of this waterway, while Greece controls the southern part. If Soviet influence extends to Greece, then the Adriatic Sea will be completely under Soviet control.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Greek peninsula extends into the Mediterranean, and the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers to grant the Dodecanese Islands to Greece brings the country's borders close to the Near East. Therefore, if Greece is in the hands of pro-British and American factions, it can protect Britain's maritime lifeline; otherwise, there is a risk of threatening the movement of British ships in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In addition, the issue of the Dardanelles Straits has recently become very heated, and it is closely related to Greece. The Soviet Union is eager to control this waterway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, but the United States and England strongly oppose it. In this region, Turkey and Greece are the only two countries controlled by anti-communist governments. If Greece leans to the left, it will effectively trap the European part of Turkey in an encirclement of pro-Soviet governments, and the Soviet Union can take a further step in controlling the Dardanelles Straits. Therefore, Turkey warmly welcomed the news of the restoration of the Greek king.</p>
<p>All of this is enough to explain why Greece is so important to various countries. Due to its geographical location, Greece is a base for political and military activities from the heart of the Balkans to the center of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Four Foreign Ministers Meet Again!</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The Relationship Between the US and the Soviet Union is Becoming Increasingly Delicate</p>
<p>In the past seven days, the international arena has been filled with an air of harmony. In particular, Marshal Stalin's remarks to a reporter from the Associated Press denied that relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were becoming increasingly tense and expressed that the Soviet Union was not particularly concerned about the entry of American warships into the Mediterranean. He also frankly stated that the Soviet Union genuinely had peaceful intentions, saying that the Soviet Union did not possess atomic bombs and that the western part of the Soviet Union had been devastated by the war, suffering heavy losses, and that it would take ten years to restore it to its former state. These remarks are indeed a stabilizing factor in the current world situation, and countries such as England, the United States, and France have all welcomed them, believing that the prospects for world cooperation are promising. However, there was a passage in Stalin's speech that involved Churchill, attacking him for attempting to incite a third world war; this aroused Churchill's dissatisfaction, and he delivered a speech in England, retorting in kind. Churchill firmly asserted that the total number of Soviet troops stationed abroad was two hundred divisions, while Stalin said that there were only sixty divisions. Thus, the dispute between two hundred and sixty has become a noteworthy issue on the international stage.</p>
<p>Molotov Remains Anti-American</p>
<p>Although Stalin's remarks had the effect of being pro-American and anti-British, the repercussions they caused internationally were quite positive. In particular, the American people, who were eager to live in peace with the Soviet Union, expressed their warm welcome; political and diplomatic figures generally believed that as long as Stalin's remarks were sincere and not just lip service, and would be put into action, then an improvement in US-Soviet relations would appear before our eyes. Following this, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 30th, proposing four suggestions: (1) All countries in the world should implement universal disarmament; (2) The use of atomic bombs in warfare should be prohibited; (3) The Security Council should exert its effectiveness in maintaining world peace; (4) A Trusteeship Council should be established as soon as possible.</p>
<p>These four suggestions are, in principle, likely to be approved by all countries in the world, especially since the United States has no reason to express any dissent. However, Molotov's speech was filled with anti-American rhetoric. He criticized the United States for using atomic energy as a backing for its foreign policy, using it to threaten other countries. At the same time, he used his dollar diplomacy strategy to try to control the entire world. He also attacked the entry of American warships into the Mediterranean. His views were completely different from Stalin's remarks, running in opposite directions, making one wonder whether the Soviet Union is now adopting a dual foreign policy. US Secretary of State Byrnes was the first to point out that Molotov's speech contradicted Stalin's remarks; at the same time, Austin, the chief representative of the United States at the United Nations General Assembly, also said that Molotov's speech had a cold war nature and seemed out of place; he said, "I do not believe that mutual accusations between allies can promote international unity."</p>
<p>Byrnes Issues a Warning</p>
<p>Molotov's speech clearly aroused two different reactions in the United States. One was the opposition, represented by former Secretary of Commerce Wallace, who said, "If the United States and the Soviet Union can treat each other honestly and each reduce their armaments, it is not impossible." On the government side, Byrnes expressed deep dissatisfaction with Molotov's speech. He was full of complaints, but for the sake of maintaining good relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, he remained silent and did not comment, but he was still very distressed in his heart. Therefore, he used the opportunity to issue a warning to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, saying, "If the Four Foreign Ministers Conference cannot reach an agreement on the German issue, then I will refuse to participate in any new international conference."</p>
<p>The Four Foreign Ministers Conference of England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union opened as scheduled on the 4th of this month. According to the pre-budgeted agenda, the work completed by the Paris Peace Conference will first be reviewed and approved. The draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland are also expected to be passed in these few days. After being signed by various countries, they will be officially established. After the 20th of this month, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will begin to discuss the German issue. All parties are already preparing for the discussion of the German issue.</p>
<p>The Issues of Japan and Korea Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>The Four Foreign Ministers Conference may discuss the issue of Allied control of Japan. According to the report of the US investigation team, Japanese financial cliques still control vast wealth and economic power; industrial associations. The continued existence of their latent power is indeed a threat to peace in the Far East. At the same time, the domestic economic situation is also continuing to improve, and they are now seeking to restore their foreign trade. It is expected that Japanese-made goods will once again flood the world market. The Ming country's policy of controlling Japan must be re-examined.</p>
<p>The Korean Southern Democratic Association also appealed to the United Nations on the 2nd of this month, making three demands: (1) Immediately implement the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations; (2) US and Soviet troops should immediately withdraw from Korea; (3) The Korean provisional government should be allowed to join the United Nations as a member state. It also said that "dividing Korea into two occupation zones is a direct threat to world peace." Standing in the position of a neighboring country, we express our deep sympathy and hope that the United Nations General Assembly will not turn a deaf ear, because how to resolve the Korean issue is something we cannot ignore.

<h3>The Conflict Between India and the Islamic League</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiren</p>
<p>Nehru and Jinnah</p>
<p>In recent months, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims has been heard of daily in various parts of India. The plane carrying Interim Government President Nehru was also attacked some time ago. At this time, when India is facing independence, there is still internal infighting between Hindu and Muslim sects. People with old-fashioned minds think that India is only fit to be ruled temporarily and not fit to rule people, because "freedom and independence" only lead to more mutual killings and riots.</p>
<p>We must also not ignore the impact of the current Hindu-Muslim conflict on the Indian Interim Government; Nehru has to slow down his pace, and every action must be carefully considered. The general public in all major cities has a worse impression of Jinnah (leader of the Muslim League) than Nehru. Nehru has more of the masses and can still sway people's hearts, while Jinnah is single-mindedly unwilling to join the government to stop the conflict, which is his weakness. Nehru believes that Jinnah's opposition to the government is a small matter, while opposing the independence of the entire India is a matter of great importance. Nehru uses Jinnah's intention as a tool for counter-propaganda against Jinnah. However, this is not easy, and Jinnah is also taking the withdrawal of British troops from India as a bargaining chip everywhere. Since Nehru is known as a patriot, he must also make British troops withdraw from Indian soil as soon as possible. Once the British troops withdraw, Nehru will naturally become even greater in the eyes of the people! From Jinnah's point of view, he can begin to disrupt Nehru's interim government with violence at all costs. If Nehru uses his own army to suppress it at this time, then Jinnah can use the excuse that Nehru is oppressing Muslims and withdraw from the government.</p>
<p>In addition, another pillar of Nehru is foreign aid. Nehru has gained foreign sympathy. Therefore, Nehru's current work on Jinnah is to use all methods to isolate Jinnah's followers and prevent them from obtaining foreign support and sympathy. The last time Jinnah wanted to seek help from Soviet Russia, Nehru knew about it and "waved" to Molotov at the Paris Peace Conference; Jinnah wanted to establish a Muslim League country from the Red Sea to the Coral Sea, and Nehru specially sent a goodwill mission to the Near East countries for this purpose; in this way, Nehru's consistent policy is to isolate Jinnah, so that he cannot get international sympathy and help.</p>
<p>Today, not only do 300 million Indian people need independence, but we also need India to be free from the standpoint of Indian friends. However, the problem lies in whether India's independence is the Muslim League India that Jinnah hopes for or Nehru's India of all sects? This question will be answered by how the Hindu-Muslim conflict ends in the future! (Excerpted and translated from the Millard's Review)</p>

<h3>The Indian National Congress Party</h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>India has been under the economic control of the East India Company since the 17th century, becoming a vassal state of England. In 1876, the British king also became the Emperor of India, and it was officially reduced to a colony. It was not until recently that Nehru, the former chairman of the Indian National Congress Party, came forward to organize an independent interim government.</p>
<p>The predecessor of the National Congress Party—the National Congress—was established in 1885 and was originally an organization loyal to the British Governor-General of India. However, since the end of World War I in 1919, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the National Congress carried out a non-violent resistance movement of non-cooperation with England, thus forming a strong political party and becoming the base camp for the Indian independence movement.</p>
<p>The organization of the Congress Party (the abbreviation of the National Congress Party) includes the majority of Hindus and a minority of Muslims in terms of religion; in terms of class, there are princes, large landowners, entrepreneurs, low-ranking classes, and socialists, so there are many party members, numbering more than five million.</p>
<p>The Congress Party demands a unified Indian government, while the Muslim League (which believes in Islam) advocates the division of India and the Islamic League. Therefore, since the establishment of the interim government, the people of the two religions have been in constant conflict. Recently, the Muslim League agreed to participate in the government, and the reorganization has been completed. Although the conflict has not stopped, it is expected to gradually ease, and they will sincerely unite to serve the newly established independent government.</p>
<h3>Behind the Scenes of the US Election</h3>
<p>— Special Article by the Editorial Office of this Newspaper Xi</p>
<p>More than 35 million American men and women will mobilize on November 5 to participate in the 80th National Election. This election will determine the political landscape of the 80th Congress, which will be convened in January next year. The first US Congress was convened in 1789.</p>
<p>Since the era of the founding fathers, American voters have used their voting rights without interruption. They elect the president and vice president (the executive branch of the government) every four years and determine the organization of Congress (the legislative branch) every two years. This year's election is commonly referred to as the congressional election because it only involves the election of members of Congress. The next presidential election will be held in November 1948.</p>
<p>The term of office for members of the House of Representatives is two years. Therefore, voters in each of the congressional districts in the 48 states will vote to elect all members of the House of Representatives, totaling 435 seats. The term of office for members of the Senate is six years, and elections are held every two years, with only one-third of the total number of seats being elected each time. This year, due to some deaths and resignations, the number of seats to be elected is slightly more than one-third; that is, 36 of the total of 96 seats. Maine has already elected a representative from that state in advance according to its laws, so the number of senators to be decided in this election is 35.</p>
<p>In each state, the number of congressional districts is determined by its population; New York, the most populous state, has a total of 45 districts and occupies the same number of seats in the House of Representatives. The least populous states have only one or two districts. Each state, regardless of size, can elect two senators.</p>
<p>For the 14 years since the birth of the "New Deal" under the leadership of the late President Roosevelt, the Democratic Party has always maintained its majority position in the Senate and the House of Representatives. This election is the first congressional election since Truman, who was elected vice president in 1944, succeeded as president last year.</p>
<p>Under the American political system, the power of each party in Congress is bound to rise and fall. If the opposition party has an advantage in Congress, or if it is composed of a Democratic majority in the Senate and a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, then President Truman's term may come to an end. The second situation described above has been seen many times in history. In the past 50 years, the opposition party has had an advantage in the House of Representatives before the expiration of the terms of US Presidents Taft, Wilson, and Hoover, although they at least maintained a minimum majority in the Senate before leaving office.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of this election, the executive head of the US government will not change. President Truman will continue to hold office and will be able to retain all cabinet members and heads of government administrative departments, but in 1948, the presidential position will face a critical juncture. Therefore, the question worth noting in the current election is what kind of senators and representatives will be elected. The trend of the election is a reflection of public opinion, which will be carefully studied by party leaders and presidential candidates in 1948.</p>
<p>A Change of Pace</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, predicting the outcome of this election has become the main topic for political commentators and newspaper editors. However, this prediction is not easy for the following reasons: This election is the first general election in the United States after the war. If history repeats itself, voters may have the intention of "changing the pace"; after a party has held a majority for a considerable period of time, there will be cyclical changes; the lack of housing, food, and supplies; the unstable wages, prices, and cost of living; and the difficulty in determining the political trends of the 12 million to 13 million returning veterans, among whom the young people are voting for the first time.</p>
<p>Although Democratic and Republican candidates disagree on domestic issues, there is no significant dispute over US foreign policy. After traveling around the country, journalists have published their opinions, which are generally consistent. The comments of Drummond, the director of the Washington branch of the Christian Science Monitor, can be used as a representative. He said, "In the states I have traveled to, I have never encountered a Democratic or Republican congressional candidate who has raised any objections to US foreign policy."</p>
<p>In congressional elections, especially in House of Representatives district elections, local issues occupy an important position. In addition to voting for government candidates, more than 2 million public positions must also be elected, including municipal officials, judges, public school board members, and more than half of the governors. Therefore, in most states, the strength of party organizations and party members is enough to determine whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party has an advantage in public opinion.</p>

<h3>Metaphors in Literary Works</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>Metaphors occupy a significant position in various fields. A storyteller uses its magic to captivate the audience; when describing a beautiful woman, they might say she has "almond eyes, willow leaf eyebrows, pearly white teeth, and a willow-like waist," concluding with "truly like a celestial maiden descended to earth." Even the general public, including the so-called "peddlers and hawkers" often disdained by the literati, uses the weapon of metaphor in various situations. If someone has a slightly large head, they might be called "big-headed ghost"; if their tongue is long, they might be stuck with the nickname "hanging ghost." If someone's expression is cold, others might scold them, "as if someone owes you two hundred cash." The examples are truly countless. We scold Japanese militarists as if they were mad dogs, and Stalin, in a meeting, likened the Soviet Union to a vegetable garden and aggressive ambitious people to pigs.</p>
<p>Even outside the realm of language, it continues to operate and function. Forming a circle with the forefinger and thumb of both hands will immediately make it clear to others what they represent. Raising a hand above the head conveys a sense of depth or height. You can use gestures when speaking to someone; in short, this "unspoken understanding" relies entirely on the "comparison" to act as a bridge.</p>
<p>Now, let's confine it to the garden of literature to discuss.</p>
<p>Open any literary work at random, be it poetry, prose, or novel, and "metaphors" will dazzlingly catch the eye with their colors, tease the ears with their sounds, and stir up people's feelings with other different postures. I often wonder, if it were banished from the literary landscape, what would literature become? It is unimaginable. Therefore, we must investigate what it is about "metaphor" that gives it such magic. In fact, the answer is easy to find, as its very name clearly indicates its meaning. However, if a "definition" is absolutely necessary, it's simple: "to compare one thing to another," an old saying that gets the job done, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Metaphor is originally a technique in rhetoric, but it has achieved a very high status in literary expression. Open the "Classic of Poetry," the ancestor of all literature, and in the footnotes of each poem, you will encounter words like "Fu (descriptive)," "Bi (comparative)," and "Xing (evocative)." The expressive techniques of the entire "Classic of Poetry" are categorized into these three areas. Now, let's first study how it is applied in literature and then touch upon its function and other aspects.</p>
<p>"Hands like soft rushes, skin like congealed fat," "like flowers, like jade," bringing a woman's beauty before our eyes. "The thick strings hum like a sudden rainstorm, the thin strings whisper softly," "The clear sound of orioles chirping outside the flowers," the pure tones of music and the delicate voices of beautiful women resound in our ears. "What he eats resembles a sick horse, his moving shadow seems to shift mountains," this is a self-portrait of a patient. Reading "fallen flowers still resemble soldiers in formation," a poignant feeling of pity arises in the heart for the tragic death of a peerless beauty. "The vast future weighs heavily like a sea," "Just like a river of spring water flowing eastward," drawing for the reader the depth and magnitude of sorrow. To describe the swiftness of life, in China, there is the metaphor "time flies like an arrow, days pass like a weaver's shuttle," and in the West, there is the saying "I Come Like Water, Like Wind I go." "Radiant as peach and plum blossoms, cold as ice and frost," describing an unattainable immortal. If we were to continue citing such examples, we could easily exhaust an entire bottle of ink. All these "like, similar, resembling, as if, as... " are symbols of metaphor. In modern terms, that would be "same, similar to, seems, as if... " and so on. But one thing must be pointed out here: not everything that carries these words is necessarily related to metaphor. For example, "if it is so, if that were the case, it seems like this..." Conversely, some metaphors don't wear such outward clothing, but their essence is still metaphorical. "My heart is like ancient well water," "The half moon of the eighth month is as clear as a mirror." There are countless examples to show us.</p>
<p>Why does metaphor have such fiery magic? From the examples above, we can extract a general principle. If you only say "time runs so fast! Really fast!" even if you repeat "really fast" ten thousand times, you still won't be able to convey a sense of speed. If you say a beautiful woman is "really gorgeous," the reader won't be able to visualize a beautiful woman from the four empty words "really gorgeous." The reason is that you are only shouting abstractly without placing a concrete image before people's eyes. If you say "parents' love is as deep as the sea," you won't fall into the satire of Mr. Lu Xun: "The love of parents, oh, oh, I cannot express it." Speaking of which, we should understand the meaning and value of metaphor. It can give people a vivid impression that can be seen with the eyes, heard with the ears, touched with the hands, and smelled with the nose. With it, the posture of literature becomes lively, the colors become bright, like green leaves setting off red flowers, adding brilliant blossoms to embroidery.</p>
<p>A metaphor is not as easy as "summoning it and it comes," on the contrary, it is like "entreating it thousands of times before it finally appears." Every concrete or abstract thing and concept in the human world can be a metaphor for another thing. You call your lover "My Moon," but you can also say conversely "the moon seems like a beauty's face." "Lotus flowers are like faces, willows like eyebrows," you can also reverse the metaphor and apply it. To describe something, a concept, there can be countless similar comparisons. You have the right to compare a full moon to a beauty's face, but you can also compare it to a jade plate. You can compare a valuable death to Mount Tai and a worthless one to a feather, but you can also compare them to something else. However, while there are many things that can be compared, only a few, or even just one, are appropriate and perfect. Whoever can seize this most appropriate few or that one will be considered successful. Like shooting at a target, from the outside in, ring by ring, the number of rings that are hit indicates the shooter's skill level, and hitting the "bullseye" is the mark of a master.</p>
<p>How do you elicit a metaphor? This is not a simple question. We should start with the generation of metaphors. All phenomena in the natural world and human affairs create different images through the function of the senses, and these images are often accompanied by emotions. Seeing high mountains naturally gives rise to solemn thoughts, and seeing "a clear river as still as silk" gives rise to thoughts of detachment and tranquility. But at the same time, we should also analyze the essence and attributes of each image. For example, the moon is a planet, it has different shapes of waxing and waning, and it has a changing brightness... Having this one-sided knowledge is not enough. We must also dissect the essence of the thing to be compared in the same way, clarify both aspects, and then take the parts you need. "The moon is like a hook" uses the shape of a crescent or waning moon, "half a mirror in the blue sky," "a face like a full moon" are naturally different. "Longing is like a full moon, its clear brightness diminishes night after night," uses not its shape but its brightness. "Appearing like a rabbit escaping" - if it is not used to convey the idea of being good at running, and you say someone is like a rabbit, what would that be?</p>
<p>The same metaphor should be applied according to the circumstances. When playing funeral music, one can use the phrase "like resentment, like longing, like weeping, like pleading." But using this as a comparison in a wedding music setting would be a joke. "Suddenly hearing of the recovery of the Soviet North outside the sword pass, tears of joy wet my clothes at the first news." If you compare tears of joy to a source of sorrow, it only shows your ignorance. A blind man can make the joke of "groping a plate and tapping a candle," but a sighted person stubbornly putting Zhang San's hat on Li Si's head would truly be a joke of jokes. Metaphor only seeks approximation, not complete identity. Taking a photograph to compare it to a person, you can't say it "resembles" you; you should say it "is" you. The wonder of metaphor, the effectiveness of metaphor, lies entirely in this semblance. This contains an exaggeration that gives the reader a clearer, more vivid, and more prominent impression, increasing the infectiousness of literature. Loving someone, you say "I love her deeper than the sea," the reader will not accuse you of exaggeration, but will feel the depth of your love. "A neck like a caterpillar, cicada forehead and moth eyebrows," reading these two lines of poetry, we only feel that the comparison is good and will not scold the author for comparing a beautiful woman to some scary insects.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may feel that some metaphors seem "inappropriate." "The sun is like a broadcasting station placed in the sky," "A vague piece of sorrow, silent raindrops falling," at first glance, it seems unreasonable, but after savoring it, you feel that it is apt. Remember that Shelley also compared sound to color. But this is not something that can be randomly compared. It must be analyzed and compared, and the closest point must be taken. The acquisition of a metaphor goes through a long process; it is not inappropriate to say "creating a metaphor." In the application of metaphors, one must not be too verbose, coming up with a large string of them like Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin of the late Tang Dynasty, only using them to cover up the emptiness of their content. Metaphor does not exist merely as an embellishment; it often fully contains emotions attached to an object. "Lotus face and willow eyebrows" touch the heart and wound the spirit, "How can I face this?" "Tears fall" accompanied by pressing memories. In order to avoid being too rigid, one need not fill the paper with words like "seems, same, generally..." etc. One can change the technique so that there is the reality of a metaphor without the appearance of one. "In the morning, they are like cut-off hibiscus flowers, in the evening, they follow the eastward flowing water." The concept of the impermanence of life is activated on the page through metaphor. Let's give another example:</p>
<p>(1) The force of the secluded valley brings up a string of deep thunder—the sound of artillery.</p>
<p>(2) Have you ever seen someone catching chickens at night?</p>
<p>They are caught just like that. There are many ways to put on metaphors. The flexibility and rigidity of the application depend entirely on the skill level of the technique.</p>
<p>We must discard stale metaphors without mercy. "Like beautiful flowers and flowing water," the creator of this metaphor was a genius, but unfortunately, its life has been tortured to death by the hands of some mediocre talents. Now, taking this skeleton as a treasure is truly becoming a slave. "Time flies like a white horse passing through a crack" no longer evokes a fresh impression. Changing the wording to "time passes faster than a horse" feels a bit fresher. Stale metaphors can also give people a new feeling, which must be based on the fact that they are placed in the right position. For example, the metaphor "dream-like" immediately feels a bit annoying, because one is tired of seeing "life is like a dream" and similar sentences. But writing "Snowflakes fall dream-like" in a poem, you might want to read it a second time. "Turning rottenness into something magical" is not easy. Seeing butterflies and calling them sisters, seeing the moon and calling it an elder sister, those who have lowered the value of metaphors too much, this little essay may be of some use to them.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Clouds (Oil Painting)</h3>
<p>— Guan Liang</p>
<h3>Turgenev and Women</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>The Russian novelist Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev (1818-1883), although he lived a solitary life, was never without women. In 1841 (at the age of thirty-three), he returned to the Soviet Union from Germany for the first time and fell in love with a serf girl from his own household. Later, this serf girl married another Soviet official, which greatly angered Turgenev. In his later years, he fell in love with a Madame Feydeau, and the two got along quite well. He would show her each of his works after completion. Once, when his famous work "Smoke" was completed, she happened to be in Berlin, so he felt very sad and depressed all day long.</p>
<h3>Art and Science</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Art is an abstract name, and if we were to give it a footnote, we could say this: anything that achieves its "purpose" through "expression," where the expression seems impractical and especially useless in terms of material things, is called art.</p>
<p>Therefore, art and science become two extremely separate departments, because science is geared towards the practical, making discoveries that benefit human life. As a result, the argument that science is the truth arises. Regarding this kind of dogmatism, there is room for consideration, or rather, it should be discarded, because it obliterates the function of art. It is impossible for science to pass through the inorganic, organic, psychological, and physiological to reach the so-called phenomenon of human life; we deny this.</p>
<p>The concept of science lies only in the word "knowledge"—an abstract concept. Scientists use this to advance the era, humans are able to progress, and the world can be transformed. However, science has many shortcomings: for example, the prosperity of science has led to the invention of the atomic bomb. The atomic bomb itself is innocent, but humans use it to threaten world peace and maintain world peace. Therefore, some people attribute the impact of the atomic bomb's invention on world peace entirely to knowledge. This is just like a politician selling out the country for personal gain.</p>
<p>The reason is that knowledge has unreliable concepts to affirm its "ideas." And art can often avoid this shortcoming, but it cannot be said absolutely. I once heard someone say, "Beauty" is enough to arouse desire but cannot satisfy a person's selfishness. To this, we have nothing to say; he is a traitor to beauty!</p>
<p>Similarly, seeing a beautiful woman in a painting will stir the heart; this is because the observer's immoral concept exists. Art can only be an observer, and only art that does not arouse desire can be called true art!</p>
<p>Therefore, art is difficult, immortal, and art has countless truths. To put it plainly, art should be "applicable to all under heaven and await the judgment of sages for generations without confusion."</p>
<h3>Dew</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dun</p>
<p>People who love dawn always like dewdrops.</p>
<p>When the black night passes and the rosy clouds dye the east red, in the awakening garden, on the flower buds, on the tips of the leaves, hang crystal clear and fresh dewdrops, like the tears in a young girl's eyes! They contain joy, but also endless sorrow...</p>
<p>People who love dawn often have a dewdrop-like state of mind. In the ocean of the universe, humans are as small as a drop of dew. Morning dew longs for the caress of the morning sun, and then melts into the embrace of the morning sun, dissolving everything of itself. Like all those who pursue sunshine, when dawn arrives, they have offered their entire lives!</p>
<p>Dewdrops are formed in the cold of the night. Let the warm sunshine take them away. Dewdrops nourish all the flowers and leaves facing the sun! Dewdrops are the enlightenment of dawn.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 84</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Having gone only a few steps, I suddenly heard that fellow, opening his hoarse voice, start singing our local tune:</p>
<p>"A maiden of eighteen years, goes into the embroidery room—</p>
<p>Entering the embroidery room, endlessly thinking of her beloved—</p>
<p>Her beloved, far away on the horizon—</p>
<p>Far away on the horizon, doesn't it break my heart!—"</p>
<p>The more this guy sang, the smaller his voice became, and the further he walked away. From the pronunciation of these words, it can be determined that this guy must be a Japanese devil, who must have spent a lot of time in the Northeast; otherwise, it must be some traitor here who taught him this folk song. It's a pity that he learned it very well, but every sentence can't get rid of the Japanese ending particle, "Pu," just like the fox spirit in the story, although it has cultivated into human form, it just didn't get rid of its tail.</p>
<p>When Tiger heard this guy singing, he almost laughed several times, and at the same time, he felt a bit annoyed; I also felt a little unable to restrain my laughter. This seemed to completely relax our tense mood and revive our spirits. Taking advantage of the fact that the searchlight had not yet swept over, I curled up my feet, because they had been stretched straight for a long time and had become stiff and sore. Who knew that this curl revealed that everything below my thighs was several times heavier and, after being soaked, had not been active, resulting in some numbness. My feet were even heavier and could not be pulled over. The pair of leather shoes I was wearing were completely filled with mud, forming a round ball, looking like two newly mud-coated preserved eggs.</p>
<p>While we were tidying up our shoes and socks, we spoke quietly. I told Tiger the principle of the searchlight so that he wouldn't worry, and also told him that it would be best to wait for the light to pass briefly before starting to climb over the wall. This would be the safest and most unhurried option.</p>
<p>After we tidied up, we rested for a while. We each took out a little something from our small pockets and ate it, and then we prepared to climb over the wall. The searchlight had already turned past three or four times while we were resting, and the timing was very accurate, so we didn't need to worry too much.</p>
<p>This stone wall was probably six or seven feet high, and the top was paved flat. When the light passed, at a prearranged signal, Tiger placed his hand on the top of the wall, shrugged slightly, and, as nimble as a civet cat, he had already reached the top of the wall, lying prostrate there, giving me a gesture of safety. Seeing this gesture, I immediately shrugged and climbed up the wall, also lying prostrate on the top of the wall like Tiger. As soon as I focused my eyes and looked around inside the wall, Tiger had already slid down along the wall. Sliding two steps at a time, like a black shadow, he crossed a road about ten feet wide and burrowed into the trees on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>This wall was more than a foot thick, entirely made of mountain stones. The top of the wall was paved very flat, and at the base of the wall inside, there was a foot-and-a-half-high platform. This was probably prepared for people to stand on, just at the height of an average person, so it would be convenient to shoot outwards. Down the platform was a tidy road, wide enough for two large military trucks to run side by side with plenty of room to spare. On the edge of the road, along the road were planted neatly arranged clumps of trees, seven or eight feet high and three or four feet thick. In this dim night, looking at both ends, this heavenly road seemed to have no end. Beyond the trees, there were no buildings; it must have been a boundless plaza.</p>

<h3>Who Buys?</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Trust Bureau, the result of the first public auction of enemy and puppet properties was that one of the three properties, although someone had already paid to purchase it, the original occupying agency had not yet moved out. The buyer spent a huge sum of nearly ten thousand yuan, only to obtain ownership.</p>
<p>This is a lesson. With such high interest rates, who would be willing to spend money to quarrel with others and increase trouble? It's really being idle with nothing better to do! Therefore, although this time a magnificent full-page advertisement has been published for the public auction of thirty-nine units of enemy and puppet properties, I am afraid that very few people will inquire, because for those friends who really have money, there are all kinds of real estate for sale in Shanghai. Why bother to seek trouble and headaches for oneself!</p>
<p>If no one buys, the Trust Bureau is not responsible and will hand it over to the Disposal Bureau. The Disposal Bureau has been very competent and meritorious in dealing with these complex enemy and puppet properties for more than a year. However, it is a temporary agency that will end in a short period of time, so how can it leave a pending case behind? And ordering the original occupants to move out first is neither reasonable nor justifiable. Moreover, the case of an agency on Kangding Road is a cautionary tale. What to do? It's a headache!</p>
<p>Why bother with a headache? Take from the people, use for the people. The authorities' main goal is only to recover legal currency, but selling with one hand and allocating funds to build civil housing on a grand scale with the other is truly laughable. In fact, the two things could have been done together. If the Trust Bureau is the owner, can't it collect a deposit from the tenants? Can't it collect rent from the tenants? The sum of these numbers is not too different from the reserve price of the auction, is it? One might as well calculate this and see if the two responsible agencies can report to the higher authorities based on the situation.</p>
<p>A Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Garbage All Over Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Jin Yishui</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a civil servant, and based on what I know and have seen, I cannot remain silent about the appearance of Shanghai. What I want to say now is: (1) The southeastern end of the main thoroughfare of the city center, by the Sichuan Road Bridge, which has now been designated as a car park (formerly a Chinese park opened by the Public Works Department), is occupied by some refugees, who have made it filthy and littered. Piles of excrement have accumulated at the bridge approach for more than a month, and the stench is overwhelming. Countless pedestrians pass by here every day, covering their noses as they pass.</p>
<p>Of course, I am one of the people who pass by every day, and I have been tolerating it all along, thinking that someone would come forward to attack the city authorities. However, after tolerating it for more than a month, the situation remains the same; therefore, out of a citizen's responsibility, I have taken up my pen late at night, in my busy schedule, to express it. I want this shameful phenomenon, which has made China lose face, to be swept away as soon as possible, and only then will I be happy! On a wooden pole on the bridge approach, there is a telephone exclusively for the police局. Every day, I see police officers covering their noses while making calls. If the police officers making the calls would report the foul odor to their superiors, or if their superiors would report it to the people in charge of cleaning affairs to clear it away, it would be a very simple matter. However, it has not been cleared for a month. I really doubt whether any of the Public Works Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the police局 of the municipal government have ever passed by the Sichuan Road Bridge. If even one person had reported this matter, then the superiors should have immediately taken action. If the director, mayor, and other leaders do not receive reports from their staff on a daily basis, it is clear that their subordinates are not doing their duty. If subordinates are not doing their duty, it means that superiors are not diligent and strict in supervision. Following this reasoning, it is not difficult to gradually track down the responsible personnel for every bad incident in the city, so that they cannot evade responsibility. This can be achieved if the superiors put in a little effort in organization and supervision. Therefore, when I am angry, I hate the mayor for being incompetent in managing his subordinates, and the directors and section chiefs cannot shirk responsibility either. If refugees are allowed to occupy the car park on Sichuan Road Bridge, so that cars that were originally on the road are still parked on the road, assuming that refugees are allowed to live there, is it necessary for Shanghai to display these refugees in the conspicuous central district? If refugees need assistance, then provide them with assistance. If they cannot be assisted, immediately evict them. The matter is very simple. However, what is the Social Affairs Bureau doing? What is the purpose of the Public Works Bureau building a car park? I always hate the municipal government for not caring. I hate even more that the citizens don't rise up to report such small things. A few cleaners could solve the problem of clearing away the excrement, but they can't even do it.</p>
<p>Also, there have been two large puddles on the sidewalk opposite the Huiluo Company, north of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, for several months. Every day when I pass by, I have to be on guard, fearing that the mayor's car will pass by and splash dirty water everywhere, and that pedestrians will be splashed with a few drops of dirty water. But I have never seen anyone go to repair it. In addition, there are many asphalt pieces accumulated on the sidewalk on the east side of Yi Si Temple. Because it has been there for a long time, the result of pedestrians trampling on it for a long time is that it has taken root. I hate the Public Works Bureau for not finding a way to remove it sooner. This work is also very easy. In addition, the Public Works Bureau accumulates small stones and sand on the sidewalk in advance when repairing roads, often accumulating it for ten and a half months before starting work, making it inconvenient for pedestrians to walk, and even causing vehicles to hit and injure pedestrians on the road. In fact, the Public Works Bureau should send materials on the day of the road repair and clear them away immediately after completion.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, please feel free to attack the bad situation in the city. This kind of attack is to promote the progress of the city and to make the mayor listen more to the opinions of the people. It is definitely not malicious. I am not making a mountain out of a molehill. I want Shanghai to progress and the municipal government to win the hearts of the people, so I say this.</p>
<h3>Driver Causes Accident, Executed On the Spot</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>The Da Xi Bao reported on the 3rd of this month: When the Wuxi County Government's car was returning to the city from visiting Meiyuan, it hit Jing Shi, a trainee of the military officer corps, due to speeding, resulting in serious injuries and death. Military officers and corps members nearby witnessed the tragic scene and were filled with indignation. They took the county government secretary in the car, along with the driver and assistant, to the corps headquarters and reported to their superiors for instructions. As a result, the driver, Zhu Linbao, was executed by firing squad at the scene of the accident. The secretary and driver's assistant were taken to the local court to await trial.</p>
<p>Comparing this news with the recent jeep accident in Shanghai, the value of human life is as different as heaven and earth. I know that some citizens who have always been intimidated by the power of the city's bullies will surely applaud and cheer when they see this.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the driver was executed by firing squad for negligent homicide due to careless driving. This is ultimately a destructive, ridiculous, and hateful act of justice!</p>
<p>The newspaper also said: "The trainee survived eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, having narrowly escaped many battles, only to die in this tragedy." This is precisely the reason why the driver's life had to be forfeited. The driver was truly unlucky. Wouldn't it have been better if he had hit an old woman from the countryside or a peddler?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is worth noting that the person who was killed was a military man. What if the driver had been a military man? People in Shanghai would probably frown again!</p>
<p>Mental Health</p>
<h3>Two Types of Fatigue</h3>
<p>— Bin Zhi</p>
<p>Everyone feels tired after working for too long. The purpose of rest is to recover from fatigue, and sleep is the best rest. That's what everyone thinks. However, the reality is not so simple. Physical fatigue can be recovered after a night's sleep, but mental fatigue may not necessarily be relieved.</p>
<p>Mental Labor and Physical Labor</p>
<p>A person who engages in physical labor can fully recover their physical strength after a night's rest, no matter how heavy the work is during the day. A person who engages in mental labor also feels clearer in their mind after waking up from sleep. This is because, whether a person engages in mental or physical labor, physical exertion increases during work, and physical exertion decreases during rest. The new growth is more than what is consumed, so physical fatigue is easily recovered. Mental fatigue refers to psychological aversion to work.</p>
<p>When a person is working, their nerves must be extremely tense, which is very inappropriate in terms of mental health. Working under nervous tension for a long time will feel monotonous and boring, which is the cause of fatigue. The simpler and more mechanical the work, the easier it is to feel monotonous, even though it is easier in terms of mental and physical effort. Changing jobs is a common way to adjust the mind and avoid aversion to work due to monotony.</p>
<p>Tension and Relaxation</p>
<p>School timetables are created based on the principles of variation and adjustment. If it is not possible to change jobs for the time being, then being able to relax tense nerves for a moment will also quickly recover, because this is not true fatigue. For example, having a cigarette or a cup of tea while working is simply a way to temporarily relax the nerves.</p>
<p>Emotions are a factor that contributes to fatigue. When nerves are tense, feelings of overthinking, hesitation, and inferiority often arise, leading to unstable emotions and even psychological abnormalities. It is very common to hope that work will be completed but to be distracted by thoughts, or to get angry when work cannot proceed smoothly. Emotional unrest or even outbursts are more often caused by people than by things. Being dissatisfied with someone and involving their work, or feeling averse to one's own work as if it were related to them, is something that a manager should not ignore.</p>
<p>Interest can reduce mental fatigue. A person with low ability who takes on a heavy workload will not only be overwhelmed but will also feel very distressed psychologically. Conversely, using great talent for a small task can also cause the person doing the work to feel bored. These are all reasons why people lose interest in their work. Therefore, a good manager can allocate work well, not only allowing each person to develop their talents but also generating great interest in the work, which promotes increased work efficiency. Interest is the driving force behind work. Although interest is related to talent, half of it depends on cultivation. Success can generate interest, and rewards can also increase interest. The way work is done and the environment in which it is done are also indirectly related to interest.</p>
<p>The working environment is inversely proportional to fatigue. The more perfect the environment, the more energetic people will be and the less tired they will feel. Perfect does not mean having spring-loaded sofas and moving music like in a cafe or dance hall, but attention must be paid to light, air, humidity, and furniture to make people feel very comfortable and happy, because good mental health is based on good physical health.</p>
<p>Ordinary fatigue is not due to a lack of physical or mental strength, but rather to a shadow cast over the mind, which can be easily and quickly recovered from. This is not an illusion but a targeted remedy, as the saying goes, "A mental illness requires a mental cure."</p>
<h3>Engagement Ring</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>In Washington, someone was driving out for a trip early in the morning and saw a young woman standing under a street lamp, completely naked, but still wearing an engagement ring on her finger. According to her, because she refused to return the engagement ring to her boyfriend, he stripped her of all her clothes. (Translated from the Continental News, October 29)</p>
<h3>Society of the Lolo People</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Professor Fang Hao, recorded by Ma Huixin</p>
<p>The place is peaceful, and doors are not locked at night.</p>
<p>This summer, Professor Fang Hao of Fudan University Chongqing Campus and others returned to Shanghai and gave a lecture at Fudan University in Jiangwan, entitled "Southwest Customs." The part about the Lolo people is quite valuable, so it is specially recorded and presented to Free Talk:</p>
<p>"In order to investigate the life customs of the Lolo people, I went to the villages of the Lolo people, hundreds of miles away from Kunming. The basic conditions for researchers are to have a strong physique, be able to ride horses, climb mountains, and sometimes bring interpreters."</p>
<p>The Lolo people call the Han Chinese "Kejia" (guests); they themselves do not want the Kejia to call them Lolo, and they consider themselves "Chinese." This is a symbol of unity.</p>
<p>Luggage does not need to be locked; they will not steal.</p>
<p>The interpreter told the Kejia that when traveling to their villages, luggage should not be locked, because they have a strong sense of self-respect, and they think that locking things means that the Kejia are afraid of them stealing. This is a sign of unfriendliness and distrust. They think it is very humiliating. However, they are also very curious and like to look at the clothes of the Kejia. A Lolo woman asked a Kejia for a man's shirt because she simply didn't know it was men's clothing. If there are some things you don't want to give them, they won't force you.</p>
<p>The Lolo people treat guests at night. They think that the most polite way to treat guests is to send two women to accompany them. When you go to sleep, they ask about tea and water and serve you attentively; otherwise, they think it is disrespectful. These women are called "living pillows." They are very humble and never leave. This is difficult for the researchers, who have to call the interpreter to convey their meaning and ask them to leave. At first, the researchers didn't know what was going on. After the interpreter told them, they learned the above-mentioned details. Now, this custom has gradually been eliminated after being taught and influenced by professors and others who have gone to the southwest for research. The place is also very peaceful, with no thieves, and residents can leave their doors unlocked at night. This is something that we cannot reach in our current environment. There are no poor people in the Lolo people's area. If someone doesn't have a job, people are willing to give you work and provide food and clothing.</p>
<p>Also, the doors of their houses are never directly opposite the doors of other people's houses. Therefore, the doors of each house are always set at an angle. They also do not interfere in other people's business, so there is no trouble.</p>
<p>Once, the Lolo people took the researchers to a place that was just a clearing with trees on three sides and no furnishings, which made people feel strange. The Lolo people said that it was the place where young Lolo men and women talked about love. Their love is also very free.</p>
<p>The Lolo people are very respectful of gods. In a deep forest, they surrounded the area with ropes, and sheep horns were tied to the ropes. They stipulated that women were not allowed to enter this area. The object of worship was a black stone, which was hidden in a hole dug in the ground. It was taken out every winter solstice, and the blood of slaughtered sheep was used to worship the gods.</p>
<p>A Strange Custom: A Small Coffin Placed on the Grave</p>
<p>They also have a strange custom: after a person dies and is buried, they make another small coffin, a few inches long, on which is written the name of the deceased, the date of birth and death, etc., with bamboo slips inside. If the deceased is a man, then hair is tied to the bamboo slips. These small coffins are hidden in the rock caves of steep mountains and cliffs, arranged in a very orderly manner. They consider these things to be very sacred, and outsiders must not transfer them. The researchers, accompanied by an interpreter, quietly ventured to climb the cliffs on a moonlit night when everyone was asleep. I (Fang said himself) hid one in my bag and brought it back for academic research.</p>
<p>The Lolo people are also very patriotic. It is said that during the War of Resistance against Japan, a statistic showed that more than eighty Lolo people in a certain area donated eight thousand Yunnan banknotes and one thousand French francs. In the circumstances at the time, their financial resources were already very wealthy. Their eyesight is good, and they can ride horses and shoot guns. It is said that many Lolo people participated in the victory of the Battle of Taierzhuang.</p>
<p>In a school run by Swiss people, a Lolo student ranked first in the Latin exam. This shows that they are also very intelligent.</p>
