<h3>蘇北國軍兩路奮進　東台興化卽可收復　共軍主力向洪澤湖退却</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿九日電〕蘇北局勢，今日已面臨全面開展階段。據今日軍方公佈：（一）自泰縣向興化推進國軍，越周家莊後，即分兩路奮進，一路向東北，一路向直北，均已於廿八日一舉收復老閣（距興化三十六華里）及沈家倫（東台八區）沿路共軍望風披靡，分別東向北茅山，及西向樊川潰退中。至由老閣前進國軍於廿九日進入十里亭，現正佈置陣地，興化縣城已在瞭望中。由沈倫北進國軍，已越過竹泓港，向大垜方面推進，民眾聞國軍到達經過，莫不簞食壺漿在河道兩側岸上，歡呼迎接。此一地區均屬水鄉，稻禾已由青轉黃，瞬屆收割之期，惟農村壯丁多爲共黨強迫驅走。（二）由海安向東推進國軍某部，於廿八日已越過富安安豐兩鎮，於廿九日進駐梁垜，東台縣城亦在瞭望中。（記者按：大垜爲東台興化直線間之中心，東距東台西距興化各六十華里，如國軍進入大垜，則東台興化兩縣城側背受擊，旦夕間即可一併收復）。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣廿九日電〕蘇北右翼前綫連日天雨戰事呈膠着狀態，國軍進至海安曲塘附近後迄尚無重大進展。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿九日電〕軍息，（一）江都兩泰六合等地共軍主力，自二十九日起，已漸向洪澤湖方面退却。（二）高郵至淮陰一帶，已無共軍主力，僅賸餘殘缺民兵。又據徐州軍息，沐陽以西一帶，由魯南南犯之共軍，因邵家店戰事激烈，二十八日起於沐陽北岸設巨砲三十餘門，不斷向南岸轟擊，十里內之民房，均爲砲火所摧燬。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰廿九日電〕靖屬六圩港正東圩一帶，廿八日夜有被國軍擊潰之共軍約八百人，乘船向澄西申港口登陸，經江中海軍發覺截擊，予以擊潰。又靖邑外圍之緊張局勢，因得大量國軍勁旅渡江增防，已略和緩。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿九日電〕共軍向徐州外圍攻擊益猛，其第二師之第四旅，第四師第七師主力，及第三師第七縱隊各一部，均已增至睢寗以西地帶，加入攻勢，至廿八日晨徐州東南之魚溝朝陽集，均被攻陷，其分向時村鎮（徐州東南）長直溝（靈璧東）攻擊之兩路共軍，經激戰後，已爲國軍擊退，國軍乘勢於廿八日通過泗縣，向共軍側後攻擊。天長以北之楊村及西北泥沛灣等地，廿七日適由盱眙增來之共軍攻擊，已均被國軍擊退。揚州儀徽以北，戰鬥仍繼續激烈進行，向南通以北丁堰鎮地區擾亂之共軍便衣隊，已被悉數驅逐。</p>

<p>〔合衆社紐約廿九日電〕霍華德系各報於社論中評稱：蔣主席縱邀請共黨參加政府，亦難保證中國內戰可告結束。該報稱：吾人不望有一赤色中國出現，亦不願中國變爲蘇聯之附庸，如蔣主席允許共黨參加政府，以資鼓勵，則共黨必將小題大做，共黨曾拒絕改編與國軍一致抗日，並發生內訌，妨礙抗日聯合陣綫，蘇聯曾於戰時否認國際共產主義，並佯欲一强大民主中國出現，惟蘇聯仍勇往直前，鼓吹國際共產主義，則聯合政府已失去其目的與意義，今日仍在世界各地爲蘇聯作第五縱隊之活動，渠等之政策爲支配他人或令他人滅亡。</p>
<h3>馬帥今返京　司徒大使病已漸愈　主席派員前往慰問</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿九日電〕馬歇爾定卅日返京，如氣候良好，將不致變更行期。司徒大使因須與主席會談，故尚有數日之耽擱。</p>

<h3>關於李聞被刺案　龍院長發表談話　希望各報勿作不正確之報道　唐縱奉命今日飛昆參加偵查</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕軍事參議院龍雲院長，頃發表談話如下：關於李聞被刺一案，政府甚爲重視，已迭派大員，前往出事地點澈查，在案情未明以前，各方自宜以極客觀態度，靜待政府之報告，以明真象。近日京滬少數報紙，對該案多作不負責任之報道，涉及私人，言之鑿鑿，不知其消息來源，有何根據，但無論爲外人所投，或自行採訪，而一涉私人，即應負法律責任，甚望各報在政府未正式公佈調查結果以前，對於此案，勿再輕率發表不負責任之報道。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕關於昆明李聞被刺案，據本報記者探悉，政府尚在嚴密偵察中，因內幕較爲複雜，故非待真相完全判明，決不致率然公佈。按龍雲之二公子純祖，原爲暫繼廿四師師長，該師士兵因不願調漢整編，故紛紛潛逃，純祖爲此，於日前來京報告，今晚應陳總長便餐，並將經過面陳陳總長，此事經過，可謂根本與昆明李聞案絕無關係。至龍雲三公子純曾，因過去交友不擇，確有不規行動，其父屢戒不悛，外間推測或即由此而起</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿九日電〕警察總署長唐縱來牯晋謁蔣主席，報告昆行經過後，奉諭在顧總司令祝同指導下，參加偵查李聞被刺案工作，廿九日晨七時，離牯赴潯飛昆，廬山夏令營辦公廳主任張振國等同行。</p>

<h3>美軍由津赴平途中　遭數百共軍襲擊　我軍事機關派隊往援救</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕蔡文治稱，今午有美兵百人由津來平，途中在安定車站附近與共軍發生衝突，政府已派軍往援。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿九日電〕軍息：美軍卅一人，廿九日午分乘卡車十一輛，沿平津公路赴平，途中行經楊村河西塢北大小沙河附近，突遭番號不明之共軍三百餘名襲擊，美軍中有傷亡，我軍事機關聞訊，已派隊前往援救。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿九日電〕此間當局稱：美陸戰隊百餘人，自津乘車赴平途中，於本日下午三時三十分，在平津之中間地帶安定站受共軍襲擊，致美陸戰隊發生死傷。今晚軍方稱：國軍增援部隊已趕至作戰地點，協助美陸戰隊，並稱：美陸戰隊曾對共軍還擊，結果致美方所遭死傷較共軍爲重，共軍曾於鐵道兩傍之戰略據點，伏擊列車，合衆社記者曾設法自美陸戰隊總部方面獲得關於該項戰事之官方詳報，惟因今晚僅軍方可優先發電至津，致未辦到。據國軍方面悉：美陸戰隊乘坐平津通車之客車數輛，於車抵安定站，乘客上下之際，槍彈忽向該列車齊發。據謂有美陸戰隊二人及乘客數人受傷。據政府當局稱：美陸戰隊曾還槍自衛，共軍人數未悉，惟咸信爲數必甚可觀，足以侵入該中國之主要交通綫，消息靈通人士咸認，今晚戰事諒仍繼續，蓋因國軍增援部隊業已抵達作戰地點。又據消息靈通方面稱：除另加開列車自平趕運國軍前往外，並有各小部隊數百人亦自附近地區沿鐵道綫馳往。此間政界咸認：此次事件十分重要，蓋因此乃共軍首次與美陸戰隊發生大規模衝突，互相開火。</p>
<h3>主席在匡廬的生活　儉約有規工作却更緊張</h3>
<p>— 本報牯嶺特派記者謝寳珠</p>
<p>蔣主席的日常私生活，簡單樸素，儉約有規。工作時間多於休息時間，這不但早爲全中國人所熟知，就是外國人士也沒有一個不欽佩的。主席到廬山以後，儉樸的生活和辛勞的工作，並不因爲處在山明水秀，富有詩意的環境中而稍輕鬆，相反地，主席的生活更簡單，而工作更緊張。</p>
<p>每日早晨，最遲七點鐘，主席一定要起來了。有時五六點就起床，起床後就和夫人在官邸二樓的凉台上做禱告半小時，如果逢到雨天，就改在書房內舉行，從不間斷。主席清晨洗臉都用冷水，睡前也以冷水擦身，每晨還要作柔軟操半小時，然後再在凉台上讀書，連大學中庸都要朗誦，而且不僅是唸唸而已，卻是高聲背誦約十幾分鐘，如果你走過幽靜的河東路時，在流泉擊石聲中，你還可隱約的聽到那誦書聲片片傳來。體操完畢，入辦公室批閱公事，處理各種要務，有時還撰擬演講詞綱要。還有一件要公就是每晨必打電話給黨政軍重要長官，吩咐安排應辦事項。</p>
<p>九時進早餐，因爲主席的牙齒並不是頂好，所以食物都是很簡單而易於消化的，他的早點多數是一杯牛奶，是用牛油炸過再烘脆的二片麵包，二個打碎的鷄蛋和些糖，稍煮熱，有時也吃些稀飯麵條之類的東西。</p>
<p>早餐後就在官邸附近散步，而且非常注意四週的清潔情形，每見有不整潔的地方，都要立即差人清除，同時三天中必有二天要輪流巡視侍從室的寢室是否整齊。工作是否勤懇。提起侍從人員主席每年均必個別召見侍從官員兩次，除了詳細垂詢每人生活，家庭狀況，或遇到有生活不檢點處，必當面親自訓斥開導外，還鼓勵他們在智識上努力進修，親自摘錄幾本書籍，如古書或主席本人言行「中國之命運」等，要他們在半年內詳細讀過，到下半年召見時，就得當場考問讀過後的必得。</p>
<p>十時半開始見客，去訪主席的人，當然都是中外貴賓，有的是因要公特地經主席召見的，有的僅是拜訪性質，如果有集會，這時就出去。</p>
<p>下午一時才用中飯，飯茶相當簡單，普通總是四菜一湯，兩葷兩蔬，常常吃些鷄湯或是拿鷄湯煮菜。主席和夫人都不太愛吃油膩的東西，最愛吃的一樣菜是「洋蔥炒牛肉絲」，還有炒青菜也是常有的。主席非但不嗜烟酒，連茶也不喝，祇喝白開水，請客時亦以開水代酒，飯後稍進水菓，山上水菓不多，主席夫婦常吃西瓜。</p>
<p>飯後午睡半小時，最多一小時就繼續辦公。三時至六時之間見客，如果客人不多，就再辦公。四時稍進茶點，和早餐差不多的點心。</p>
<p>六七時左右，就和夫人或邀幾個客人出外散步，在小溪邊坐坐談談，其中以馬歇爾夫人在一起時比較最多，然後請客人回邸，在八時左右進晚餐，九時至十一時又再進辦公室工作，計劃明日一天的工作或規定應召集的人員，還要打電話到各處垂詢各方長官所囑辦理事情的經過，到十一時半才就寢，睡前再得靜坐二十分鐘，思索一番一天內的得失成敗，遇到什麼失敗或困難的地方，必定都一一記下，以備改進策劃，謀取解決。</p>
<p>除了散步野餐或下下跳棋外，主席可說沒有娛樂，官邸內有一架無綫電收音機，空下來主席就收聽京戲唱片，主席對於京劇是頗感興趣的。</p>
<p>主席的服裝也是異常簡潔樸素，料子都普通得很，見客時如遇文官則穿藍袍黑褂，見武官時則穿中山裝或軍裝，出外散步時多數穿中山裝，但有時也穿軍服及長袍馬褂，星期日則到斜對面小教堂去做禮拜。</p>
<p>主席的賢明能幹和記憶力之强，真是沒有人能及到的，每到一個地方，他早就把當地地圖研究過，不但地勢地形諳熟在心頭，連地質也非常清楚。有一次主席夫婦帶了隨員到蘆林去玩，又有一次到醫生窪去遊覽，回來時本當走原路回去，可是主席說另一條路也可走，而且還近些，但是大家都不知道，姑且走走，結果果然到家，幾次都是那樣。又有一次，主席夫婦和馬歇爾夫人出遊，走過一條林蔭的道路，那泥土好像水門汀，質軟而鬆，踏上去像棉花似的，主席就告訴馬夫人，這種泥土與其他的大不相同，而且祇有牯嶺才有，旁邊人都從未知道，一聽之下，不禁暗暗佩服。</p>
<p>最後，還有一件事是必須要一提的，就是主席對於老百姓的愛護，每當主席在林中或街上散步時，行人都遠遠地立正，要行敬禮，主席總是招呼他們不必拘禮，隨意過去好了。看到老百姓衣服不整齊，就叫他們扣子扣好，如果手足骯髒，又叫他們去洗洗乾淨。此外，主席每逢見到有未成年的小兵，一定令隨員把他帶回官邸，查問其番號及所屬部隊，立即召部隊主管長官來告訴他，不准讓未成年孩子當兵，並吩咐另行安插。</p>
<p>廬山地方不大，主席又　常常出外散步，或出席集會，使山上的人得到不少的機會見到主席，更覺得主席的仁慈親切，好像看見自己的父親一般，難怪逢到高呼「蔣主席萬歲」時，那響亮熱烈的聲音，會使任何人都要被感動而興奮起來。（七月廿七寄自廬山）</p>

<h3>法越衝突愈演愈烈　越北僑胞處境難　法破壞協定任意加重華僑負担</h3>
<p>〔中央社河內廿八日電〕越北十餘萬華僑，今日陷於一極複雜之政治旋渦中，此間法越武裝衝突，雖已止息，但政治鬥爭，則愈演愈烈，雙方每一鬥爭，均與華僑發生直接間接關係，蓋越北商業，刻均操天華僑手中，三月六日法越協定，規定越南有財政自主權，但目前流通於越南之鈔票，係由法人經營之東方匯理銀行發行者，該行以事實上需要，經法政府核准，於三月六日以後，增加發行之越幣，達廿二億元，此項增發鈔票，越南政府認爲違反法越協定，破壞越南財政自主權，不准流通，但越南政府並未有效阻止法商銀行發行新鈔票，唯消極的取締使用鈔票，華僑以商業來往較繁，自爲鉅額鈔票持有者，越南當局因此時常搜抄華僑商店住宅，任意沒收華僑所有鈔票，華僑財產因此受損失者爲數至鉅，法國駐越北專員公署公佈，華商貨物進出各港口時，可不報關納稅，乃同時越南政府財部，亦公佈一項稅則，規定華商貨物進出越南各地，應向越南政府納稅，對於法方通知華商可不納稅，爲違反法越協定，越南政府公佈稅則後即在海防等地，實行設關檢查征稅，並在各公路交通要道，設檢查站，凡華僑貨物經過，莫不加重征稅，而經向越南政府納稅之華僑物資，經過法人控制區域進，雖不必納稅，但以曾向越方納稅法方認係破壞中法協定，向我駐河內海防領館，提出抗議者，已有數起，法方並通知我領館，凡華僑一切生命財產，法方决遵中法協定負全責保護，但事實上，華僑足跡遍全越各地，法人所到之地，僅較大城市，根據中法協定，華僑自應與法方一致，但事實上，又不可能，事秦事楚，使越北十餘萬華僑深感處境困難。</p>
<p>〔中央社河南廿八日專電〕搭招商局海川輪自滬返國之越僑九百人，廿七日下午抵海防，此批越僑原爲法軍海外部隊之一部，越南當局將予以整編後，參加越南軍隊，繼續服役。</p>
<p>〔中央社河內廿九日電〕滇越邊境河陽僑胞，以地處越南兩黨衝突區域，處境困難，除已派代表來河內向各方呼籲，請求救濟外週前復推派代表黃玉錦，農永福，至邊境長栗坡，向越當局交涉，行前並已徵得越方同意，發給通行證，詎於廿二日回河陽途中於清水河越軍營附近二公里處，突被武裝越人數名攔擊，黃玉錦身中二槍大腿骨折斷，農永福被綁失蹤。此訊傳至此間後，僑胞們至爲震動，以正式華僑代表竟遭武裝越人非法攔擊失蹤，已請我駐河內總領館向法越雙方交涉。</p>
<h3>我船隻行駛南洋　貨物迭遭荷沒收　印尼政府提高進出口稅</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿八日電〕據天聲日報稱：近頃行駛各荷屬海港及爪哇新加坡間之中國船商，正面對非常艱困之時期，蓋荷蘭當局不斷在海面沒收渠等之貨物，而印尼政府又提高進出口稅至驚人程度。該報稱：七月上半月間，即有裝載於兩艘中國貨船中這白糖約九千包，於未駛抵井里汶之前，被荷蘭軍艦武斷爲敵產，予以沒收，中國籍貨主早已爲此項白糖向印尼當局繳納百分之二百之高出口稅。據估計，此項白糖運抵井里汶後，每包約值一千荷盾，又由新加坡等地運來之入口貨物，如紙烟，自行車等，均被印尼海軍以低價强購，或逕予沒收。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿七日電〕荷蘭船芝巴達號，昨夜自此間啟碇開赴中國各口岸，船中載有中國籍搭客一千六百名。</p>

<p>增加浙西米產量　金大教授擬就計劃</p>
<p>〔本報杭州通訊〕金陵大學農業經濟系教授應康耕氏，乘暑期之便，並應菱湖章榮初氏之約，率學生十餘人，赴浙西塘樓，菱湖等處，考察農業，爲時二月，除各專題研究報告整編後陸續發表外，應氏對於浙西食米生產增加希望之大，尤感興趣。特擬就「浙西食米增產計劃書」，俾供參考。聞該計劃係以極準確及富有保守性之數字擬就，而以改良灌溉排水工具與增施肥料爲主。估計每市畝水田在水利工具方面，一次永久性的投資二萬元，肥料方面每年投資一萬五千元，則每市畝水田可增產五至十五市斗，或折價爲二萬五千至七萬五千元，而稻草與冬季作物之增產，尚未計算在內。蓋浙西農田因缺乏水利工具及肥料，影響產量匪淺，聞該計劃擬就後，即將分贈關有各界喚起注意。</p>

<h3>中國和平之大梗</h3>
<p>和平，和平，在中國今日，實在是順乎天而應乎人的！</p>
<p>中國人民需要和平；中國政府也需要和平。中國人民在苦戰八年以後，渴盼還鄉，渴盼回家，渴盼恢復常態的生活，自然誠心蘄求和平。江蘇耆老袁希洛氏願意絕食苦勸，就是中國人民需要和平迫切呼聲的代表。　蔣主席始終主張「政治解決」，並且提出暫時劃分軍隊駐地，聽候依照馬帥方案整編，以爲停止軍事衝突的具體辦法；宋院長更明說「國內不和平，財政經濟將絕無辦法」。這尤其是政府需要和平最坦白的表示。</p>
<p>不僅中國人民與政府需要和平，我們的盟邦亦多需要中國和平。杜魯門總統去冬對華政策的聲明，馬歇爾特使的被派來華，司徒雷登大使的新任命，以及馬帥和司徒大使最近僕僕京牯天空，抱病斡旋，都是美國渴望中國和平的事實。美國這種促成中國和平統一的政策，不獨美國認爲對的，按照去年十二月莫斯科三國外長會議的公報，英蘇兩國也同意「需要在國民政府下之統一而民主的中國，需要各民主份子廣泛參加國民政府，及需要立刻停止軍事衝突」。可見一切盟邦也都渴盼中國真正能够迅速獲得和平。</p>
<p>中國人民和政府，以及中國的盟邦尤其是美國，旣這樣渴求和平，而和平至今竟還未得到，一若可望而不可即。其癥結究竟在那裏？</p>
<p>延安的共黨司令台，和各地的共黨發言人，乃至爲共黨搖旗呐喊的朋友們，在最近都在大嚷小叫，說中國和美國的反動份子，利用美軍的駐華，和美國對國民政府的援助，製造中國的內戰。照他們這種歪曲的宣傳，好像只要美軍撤離了中國，美國停止了援華，中國就可獲得和平；果爾，則美國自戰爭期間以至戰後受降這樣熱誠援華，豈非如俗諺所說「要好反成惡」，而這些信口開河的發言人却又十足表現了他們「以怨報德」的素性。凡有良知的中國人，一定不會有這種看法。</p>
<p>我們以爲中國和平之大梗，就是中國共產黨只知仰承外人的鼻息，而絲毫沒有國家觀念和民族意識。惟其如此，中共等於沒有靈魂的軀殼，它自己做不了主！中共不像英國共產黨和美國共產黨一樣。一而自己又沒有主意，再則它自己只知乘機擴充軍隊，而不知到了某種階段，已成尾大不掉之勢。政府與中共間的和平談判，自去年八月間毛澤東先生應邀到渝起，拖延近乎一年，所以始終忽寒忽熱，若斷若續者，其病根就在乎此。說得明白一點：要看中國和平的前途，似乎還不該單看到延安，更遠一些必須望望莫斯科，若祇就南京和牯嶺間來窺測和平的氣候，恐怕多少有些糢糊。美國前副國務卿威爾斯廿八日廣播時說：「莫斯科鑒於美蘇兩國關係日見緊張，業已授意中共領袖，在國共談判中，對於公平而具有建設性的解決方案，亦加拒絕。」威爾斯先生這句話，大概是稍稍看清楚了一些纔說的吧。</p>
<p>但是，我們不能怪莫斯科，我們却應探究兩點：（一）爲什麼「中國人」中間竟會產生這些甘心接受莫斯科授意的人們？（二）爲什麼接受莫斯科命令的中共居然會在中國土地上成長？這兩點，實在就是中國今日所以不得和平的關鍵所在。</p>
<p>第（一）點沒有什麼稀奇。任何國家都有這類人，所不同者多少而已。「中國人」以前旣有甘心聽命日寇的汪精衛溥儀之流，那末何能保證絕對沒有人聽命於莫斯科？所以單有這一點，還不足爲中國和平之患。</p>
<p>第（二）點，我們却要責備政府了！我們抗戰，人人都知道爲爭取國家的獨立自主，何以聽命莫斯科的中共竟能在中國滋長？八年抗戰，中共對外時作歪曲宣傳，而政府始終漠然無動，一也。中共要打要談，絕對靈活主動，而政府處處被動，事事敷衍，二也。中共實際剝削人民，口頭則大吹實行三民主義，更擴大宣傳它的分田政策；而政府則放着「耕者有其田」的遺教於不顧，束置中央所通過的土法，工廠法，土地政策，農工政策，和社會政策等等於高閣，好像這些法律和政策都不過是點綴裝飾之品，三也。最後，政府在戰勝之初，忽略了應即負起給與人民以安居樂業的責任，却只看見有槍的共產黨，以爲只要用「分割政權」的方法喂飽了共產黨，天下就可太平，於是中共就看清了政府心理上的弱點，稱兵構亂，攻城奪地，而政府在起初只是袖手挨打，苦苦求和，不但不能在軍事上解人民於倒懸，抑且不能在政治上給人民以希望，四也。積此四因，中共乃狃於過去技術之可用，再三施展其「談談打打」之慣技，而中國和平遂至今可望而不可即。總之，我們須把中國和平問題，和國際和平問題合起來看。不僅因爲世界的和平不可分割，而實在因爲梗阻中國和平的中共乃是世界共產黨的一環。威爾斯先生說得好：美蘇關係日見緊張，中共就拒絕公允而具有建設性的和平方案。豈但如此，中共且進一步在中國發動反美宣傳，以與莫斯科的廣播和報紙論調相呼應。美國生活雜誌杜勒斯著的「蘇聯外交政策」裏說，蘇聯把世界約分三個地帶：唐努鳥梁海和旅順口，都在她的「內部地帶；」外蒙古，新疆，和東北九省，都在她的「中間地帶；」而中國全部則爲她的全世界「外圍地帶」中之一國。中共在中國境內之所爲，大概正合此「外圍地帶」之所需要。我們須先認清這內幕，然後可以爲中國和平下對症的藥，解除這阻碍和平的因素。</p>

<h3>法總統皮杜爾當選主席　歐洲和會開幕致辭　希望永遠消弭戰禍　設置兩委員會討論程序問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿九日直接廣播：宣傳已久之和平會議，卒於兩小時前（上海午夜）展幕。艾德禮·貝爾納斯·莫洛托夫·維辛斯基先後蒞臨，首由法總統皮杜爾宣佈大會開幕，旋即由皮氏致詞，凡十分鐘，掌聲雷動。皮氏係用法文致詞，原文在譯出中，其要點有二：（一）盼望和平能為歐洲帶來該地球上一角所最需要之綏靖。（二）永遠阻止戰禍。致詞畢，大會一致推選皮杜爾為和會主席，旋並委出兩委員會，討論程序等問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿九日合衆電〕今日下午四時（上海時間午夜十二時），廿一國出席和會代表，安坐於盧森堡宮之紅天鵝絨椅上，靜聆法總理皮杜爾代表法政府歡迎各國來賓之演說。此次之巴黎和會中，將不真正訂定和約，而僅由各有助於盟方勝利之小國中述其對和約看法，及如何始可獲得和平，然後四强衡量此等建議，再行訂定最後和約。貝爾納斯稱，希望廿一國代表曾於巴黎期間能即簽定此和約，凡戰敗國亦得陳述其意見。僉信和會有大力量，將用於訂定對義和約，因此一和約包括義大利非洲殖民地及特里拉斯特問題。拉丁美洲代表團公開活動，以求從寬處置義大利，但蘇聯及其附庸國則對義國頗有苛求。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕廿一國和會開會後，即將討論四强所提議之程序法則，起草和約之四强與其他十七國，預料將在此發生第一次之衝突。該項程序之要點，為分成委員會，討論五國和約中之每一和約，無論在全體大會或委員會之討論中，悉採三分之二大多數之表決制。在原則上，此項程序僅係一種建議廿一國得予以接受，修改，或拒絕，若接受以後，四强祗須有三分一之贊助者，即可阻止任何國家所提修正和約草案之建議。一般預料若干未曾參加和約起草工作之盟國，對於四强之工作，不免提出批評。其中發言最多者預料將為澳外長伊伐特。至於五個前之敵國，亦被邀陳述意見，想義大利等必將利用被邀之機會，一申其反對草案之意見。四强商擬和約草案，幾費去一年之時間，對於他國之異議，自將力予反辯。</p>
<h3>和約草案　今日公佈　四國已商獲同意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：據消息靈通方面稱：英美蘇法外長代表會議議決，明日發表外長會議所擬定對義，羅，匈，保，芬等五國之和約內容，將由倫敦，華盛頓，莫斯科同時發表。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿九日電〕英相艾德禮與貝爾納斯，今日下午進行會談，歷時甚久，討論題目未予宣佈。但代表團人士相信，當涉及巴勒斯坦問題。並聞發表和約草案一項問題，亦曾提出討論。</p>
<h3>對義和約要點</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕四國外次草擬之對義大利和平條約，即將於今日開幕之和平會議提出討論，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）義大利邊境當依照一九三八年一月一日狀態，但特別割讓者除外。（二）法義邊境略加修正，義大利應在聖裴納特山隘·西尼斯山·泰培山·夏倍頓區·蒂尼斯伐蘇別斯·及洛耶各地割讓數公里。（三）義大利與南斯拉夫邊境，應依法國所提議之邊界綫劃定，綫東全部區域當移交南斯拉夫。特里埃斯特自由區將在「法國綫」內設立。（四）義大利當與奧地利締結技術上的協定，確保蒂羅爾省北部與南部之自由通行。（五）義大利應以杜特坎尼斯羣鳥之全部主權讓與希臘，該區將保持非武裝區域。（六）義大利承認並尊重阿爾巴尼亞之主權與獨立，義大利對阿比西尼亞亦然。（七）義大利邊境各種永久防禦工事，凡火力可射及法國領土或領海者，應予撤除。沿南斯拉夫邊境各種軍事設備亦當摧毀。（八）義大利當在七年以內，向美國賠款一萬萬美元，對其他各國賠款另訂之。（九）在和平條約實施後之十八個月內，義大利應給予聯合國會員國特別待遇，至義大利與聯合各國簽訂貿易協定時為止。</p>
<h3>撤廢在華特權</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社廿九日電〕廿一國和平會議所將討論之對義和約草案，其中有關中國部份，要點如下：（一）義大利放棄一九〇一年九月在北京簽訂之最後議定書（即庚子條約）中一切利益與特權，及其一切附錄與補充文件，義大利同意上述議定書及附件應予作廢。（二）義大利放棄賠款項下之任何要求。（三）義大利同意取消天津義租界之租借權，並以義方所保存屬於租界檔案中之任何文件，交與中國政府。（四）義大利放棄對於上海及廈門公共租界之權利，並同意上述租界應交還中國政府治理。</p>
<h3>戴高樂發表演說　主張英法締盟　反對德國統一與集權</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法國巴勒杜克廿八日電〕戴高樂將軍頃在此間發表演說稱，基於英美兩國友誼之歐洲，在美蘇兩大集團之間，應不偏不倚作為一種平衡力，英法兩國人民如能成立一項基本協定，致力和平，與其在戰時共同努力，初無二致，則對於世界將有莫大之裨益。締造和平增强保護和平之組織，為時甚暫，稍縱即逝，吾人應及時努力。惟在此際仍有若干要點，尤其是德國問題，使英法兩國分離，未能趨於一致。法國和平當繫於德國運命之解決，不問德國將遭遇何種困難，德國仍為德國，質言之，彼為在歐洲心臟之一偉大民族，雖已墮入深淵，但仍不忘懷過去光榮的成就。倘能獲得復興之時機，則彼又將從事戰爭矣。職是之故，凡足使德國又復成為統一的集權的國家，法國均表示反對。法國對於德國問題所提出之解決方案，最切實際，德國各邦例如普魯士，巴伐里亞，伍爾登堡，巴登，赫斯巴拉丁南特曁萊因等邦，均能保持其傳統名稱，並實行自治，惟將魯爾區之兵工廠置於國際管制之下，將藍爾區歸還法國，並以德國西陲若干地方割讓與波蘭。至於德國鄰邦之安全，亦應取決於奧特河秘萊因河上。又美政府所提原子能管制計劃，在法國視之似極合理。</p>
<h3>法企求安全　皮杜爾闡明立塲</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法國聖埃蒂恩城廿八日電〕歐洲和會開幕前夕，法內閣總理兼外長皮杜爾，在此間發表演說稱，法國如在危險狀態中，則世界任何一國均將無安全可言，故法國堅持其安全所需之保障。法國人民之運命已繫於一髮，關係太大，故法國安全現所遭遇杌隉不安之情形，應設法消除之，實為重要。</p>
<h3>我代表團陣容</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿八日專電〕中國代表團組織今日業經公佈，首席代表王世杰，代表為郭泰祺，傅秉常，錢泰，副代表為駐比大使金問泗，駐義大使于焌吉，駐葡公使張謙，駐瑞士公使梁龍，張謙兼秘書長。担任顧問者有外交部歐洲司長吳蘭如，駐義大使館參事薛光前，外交部專員黃正銘，國立北平圖書館專家袁同禮等，尚有九名參議，九名秘書，十名助理秘書，全體代表團達四十人。</p>

<h3>盧森堡故宮　修葺煥然一新　新聞記者特別優待</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕六百四十名工人費四十日之久，裝修盧森堡宮，成為世界和平之新搖籃。廿一國代表今日午後三時在宮中大廳列席，決定對德國舊盟國之和平條約時，世界和平之命運將受衡量。新聞記者得自由參加，供記者應用之電話不下四十六架之多。會塲裝置特別擴音設備，使會塲外面之聽者亦可聽得塲內各種演說。法國總統皮杜爾將以地主資格，向各國代表致歡迎詞，繼之將討論程序問題。全體會議將一連舉行多次，每一代表團長均將發表演說，闡述該國對於和平條約之見解。宮中特開房屋，供秘密工作人員辦公，各代表之汽車夫亦有專室。按聯軍前此衝入巴黎時，德軍部隊憑盧森堡宮作最後抵抗，故房屋受相當損害，大規模興修工程業已完成。</p>
<h3>開羅英軍總部　移蘇彝士運河</h3>
<p>〔路透社亞歷山大廿八日電〕中東英軍總司令部宣布：駐埃英軍總司令部將於九月底以前，自開羅移往蘇彝士運河，以為自埃及撤退之初步行動。中東英軍總部在年底亦將作類似之移動。</p>

<h3>愛爾蘭擬申請　加入聯合國　决定放棄中立</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫廿八日電〕愛爾蘭國會上週一致通過加入聯合國之決議後，現已決定放棄其中立政策，此為第二次世界大戰期內歐洲第一個中立國願接受聯合國之責任與義務而為其會員之一。總理伐勒拉以明白之語調告國會稱，愛爾蘭成為聯合國之會員後，應克盡職責，倘欲規避義務，則屬極大不利，應抱守法之決心，共同參加其執行工作。愛爾蘭於三星期前曾徵詢英國對愛爾蘭加入聯合國之意見，其答覆旣極友好，復保證當協助愛爾蘭提出申請。</p>

<h3>前金大教授在國際法庭追述　日軍在南京獸行一斑　另一證人陳訴親身所歷慘境</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿九日專電〕前金陵大學史學教授貝德士，今在國際法庭，評述日軍在京所犯各種姦淫屠殺及焚掠等暴行時，法庭充滿恐佈驚詫之空氣。貝氏前為國際安全區委會委員，渠估計日軍在南京所犯姦淫案約二萬件，平民被屠殺者至少有一萬二千人，此數不包括被指為前屬軍隊之人民在內。貝氏陳述時，因若干細節所含之恐佈悽慘，無可名狀，而為之躊躇。庭長魏勃乃請證人勿因所擬言及者，過於恐佈，而不欲敘述。貝氏乃稱：日軍姦淫婦女，不分晝夜，有時竟在街上為之。有一婦女在某公墓內遭日兵十七人輪姦，有一女孩年僅九歲，及該女孩七十六歲之祖母，竟在南京城內同被姦淫。日兵以十五至二十人為一隊，常不分日夜，進入安全區，搜羅婦女，甚至大學教授夫人亦不免遭受日兵荼毒失身。貝氏回憶南京大屠殺之情狀曰：最奸詐毒辣者，斷為日軍引誘中國人喪命之詭計。當時日軍總司令松井石根曾出一佈告謂：日本以善意待中國兵。日兵告以前之中國兵謂：如彼等參加勞動隊，則一切可以不計，但俟若干以前之中國兵承認其過去之身份時，即被日兵排成行列，以機關槍掃射，另有中國平民二百人於離開金大校舍後，當晚即被日軍射殺。貝氏敘述日軍之劫掠為有組織及一貫之行為，並證明日兵在軍官指揮下，將搜劫之物用卡車運走隨時隨地取走任何物件。日軍甚至常將美國旗扯下撕毀，並拒絕尊重當時仍中立之美人財產，甚至德國籍之私人財產亦被日兵侵佔。貝氏並述及日兵之焚燒暴行謂：南京淪陷一星期後，長時間之內，不斷焚燒。先是，遠東開發公司上海經理徐君作證稱：一九四二年五月，余道出滇緬公路時，目擊被日兵殺死之中國人死屍七百零三具。日兵劫掠此輩平民之物件，然後令彼等坐成一圈，（徐君亦在其內）用機槍加以掃射，機關槍發時，余即向前俯下，余兩側之人均被殺死，屍體倒在余身，次日余又見平民約一千人之屍體，此輩或被槍斃。或被刺刀戳斃。</p>
<h3>美國傳教士　大批返遠東</h3>

<h3>珠港事件前車之鑑　美决佈置諜報網　由李希范登堡分主其事</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國已決心在國外佈置最完善之諜報網。美陸海軍當局，以珍珠港被日軍偷襲為前車之鑑，茲發出警告，謂美國不能再度成為此類襲擊之受難者。敵人倘再度進攻，殆將運用殲滅性之大批原子彈無疑，美國此後已不能如上次戰爭中，在一兩年內，集中力量發動反攻。稍微預知危機始可避免美國於浩劫。杜魯門總統於此各警告，已下令設立</p>

<p>其任務在籌劃，發展，並調整美在國外之諜報活動。由國務院，陸海軍部，及總統私人代表李希上將主持其事。總統又設立中央諜報處，為該機構之執行部，由范登堡中將為主任。該執行部將協助全國諜報機構擬訂計劃及政策，並將聯邦各部門搜集之各種外國諜報，加以整理，散發於美政府有關各機關，以供參考。</p>
<p>中央諜報處</p>
<p>現已成立，但未實際參加蒐集外國情報工作，此事留待國務院駐外代表，陸海軍諜報人員，及其他適當機關担任。但此項計劃有種種限制，致使現行機構不能與英國秘密工作之高度效力相競爭。美國人傳統的反對在友好之外國實行偵探，或刺探他國私事，即其受限制之一端。據國務院調查及諜報司長倫求率直稱：「美國如欲有一間諜網，不能在國務院中產生。吾人</p>
<p>不作陰私工作</p>
<p>或四處刺探。大使及其屬下不能作此污穢任務。彼等之作為必須適合其外交官身份。」陸海軍部諜報當局見解亦同。陸海軍駐外代表，大部為分駐數十處大使館及公使館之陸海軍參贊，其行動如觸犯駐在國政府，將被回召國。海軍諜報副主任綸特稱：「美國海軍參贊必須經由合理方法獲得情報。」陸軍部諜報當局所言亦然。</p>
<p>美戰略服務局</p>
<p>在戰時極著功績，該局人員現正協助平時諜報機構之組織。戰略服務局於去年裁撤，由國務院接辦其調查股，其中有史學家，地理家，人類學家，及其他專家共五百人。戰略服務局之偵探股，則移歸陸軍部接辦。國務院組成調查股，由倫求領導，分析諜報材料。各專家將作廣泛的及有組織的研究，包羅多處地理區域，如魯爾區域，土耳其海峽，及義大利局勢等一切題目，均在其列。至於中央諜報處主任范登堡，乃為樂觀派人物，渠稱：「吾人有偉大計劃，豐富理想，但吾人現正在組織階段。請假以時日，予以支持，則吾人必可成功」云</p>

<h3>糧貸舞弊案四糧官之一　楊錫志歸國抵滬　逗留二三日後已赴京報告一切　傳曾至警備部投案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧貸舞弊案，自經監察使署檢舉以來，由軍事司法兩機關訊究累月，迄今猶無明朗之結果，近週來，該案之進行，尤顯沉寂，社會人士對此均極感關切。記者爲此昨再走訪警備部軍法處曾處長，據談，該案事實上月前並未擱淺，惟因主管當局迭令下屬不得擅自向外發表消息，故究已進行至何種程度，不便奉告。惟可以確言者，將來該案之判決，必完全根據法理，無論有罪無罪，皆可提供充足之證據。記者復詢以該案之判決，是否須在請徐部長答覆有關各點以後，曾氏則笑而言他，僅謂至下月六七號左右，本案當可揭曉。記者因悉被檢舉之四糧官之一，前上海市糧政特派員楊錫志，已於日前自美返國抵滬，在滬逗留二三日後，已於前日晋京，向糧食部報告赴美出席聯總糧食會議及訂購洋米之經過。而外傳「楊錫志於返國後，已向警備部投案」，特舉此以叩曾氏，曾氏稱，未聞有此事。又悉糧貸商之帳冊，已經會計師查竣，惟報告書尚未送達軍法處。</p>
<h3>聯總對我救濟物資　停運令將取消　自經蔣氏解釋聯總表示同情</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「聯總」對我國救濟物資停運之令，日內確將取銷。「行總」發言人稱，至昨日爲止，上海方面尚未接到「聯總」取銷此令之正式通知，但「行總」最近曾接到該署華盛頓分署報告，「聯總」當局於接獲蔣廷黻氏日前在滬發表之解釋後，對於「行總」工作困難情形，頗表同情，故原則上取銷前令，當無問題。</p>
<h3>民衆輪擱淺</h3>
<p>民生公司民衆輪，自修竣後初航宜昌，數日前駛越漢口，昨據該輪來電，報告該輪於駛達宜昌下游四十里處，忽告擱沙，正電宜昌派輪援救，駁卸所載貨物，以减輕重量，使船身浮動。</p>
<h3>北洋綫客貨纍纍　無船裝出　林森漢陽二輪今分駛汕青</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日航運狀態，據報關運輸業消息，南洋綫數星期來商運，尚稱暢通。招商局林森號，今日出口駛汕頭兼灣福州。海皖輪定八月一日直駛廣州。鄧鑑輪定同日駛廈門，回程兼灣福州。長江綫雖有民生三北兩公司偶有船隻上下，客貨運未能滿足。招商局商運僅上月中開一江漢輪駛漢，已於上星期六，自宜昌運川糧返滬，雖已決定駛漢，確期尚未定，恐客貨亦難報裝。至北洋綫客貨纍纍，一時無船可裝，即救濟品亦有數千噸，即有船北駛，祗可儘先載運救濟品，客貨尚無望。各報關運輸業亟盼招商局設法船舶加以調配，得能减輕各業損失。又訊太古公司漢陽輪今午自滬駛青島，該輪除香港原船貨運青外，本市亦加裝少許貨件。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕記者昨在國際飯店二樓交通界返國人員中意外發現四年前同去內地之老友某君。重逢之下，握手言歡，某君係交大機械系畢業，原在交通部廣西全州機廠工作，去年四月間在筑考取實習人員後，至渝飛加爾各答轉搭貨輪去美。抵達後派在自芝加哥至舊金山鐵路公司工廠中實習。實習方式，並非實際參加工作，而係在各部門參觀學習。在美費用初由美方在租借法案下撥付，蓋以原先目的在訓練後參加反攻工作，旋以勝利提早來臨，美方即停止供給，改由我政府負担。記者詢以歸國後之感想，據稱第一感到者厥爲生活程度及物質環境之相差太遠。返國人員均感上海之窄小擁擠猶如「鴿子棚」。此外政府當局對於彼等返國後之工作似並無整個計劃，大多數人仍須自行設法，而對目前一般政治經濟之情勢，尤使彼等頗感失望云。</p>

<h3>繫獄十年之楊文道定期重審　冤獄因勝利而獲平反機會　同時傳訊者十一人之多　唐懷羣盡義務到底</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕十一年前轟動全國之楊文道案，最近當可有水落石出之望。按楊因當年廣樂安路日本水兵中山秀雄被殺，被日人指爲兇手，初覆二審，均判死刑，旋向最高法院上訴，當即由最高法院裁決發還原審法院更審，不意戰事發生，國軍西移，判決書旣無從送達，楊文道遂不得不身繫囹圄，引頸待戮，於暴敵威脅之下，竟達十年之久。勝利後，楊子漢枝，四出奔走，始於今春由高院核准，楊文道交保就醫，而最高法院七年前所發出之判決書，亦於上月送達。茲悉楊文道已接獲高院刑二庭重審本案之傳票，囑於八月十七日下午二時，到庭受訊，同時被傳者有十一人之多，當年向日籍警長首告楊氏爲兇手之曾元（即曾元佳）與楊建中，亦在被傳之列。此外被傳者，並有於楊文道有利之證人張琛，惟此人聞已於數年前爲日人所害。當年負責檢騐中山秀雄屍體之法醫魏立功及法院指定爲楊義務辯護之律師張志讓，亦均被傳出庭作證。至楊文道此次所聘律師，則仍係爲楊奔走十餘年而未取分文公費之唐懷羣。</p>

<h3>利潤百分之二百　「袖珍書」擁有最多顧客　「生活」「時代」銷路獨佳</h3>
<p>觀於大量西書雜誌的在市上出現，西書業似乎頗顯蓬勃的氣象。</p>
<p>一般說起來，經營西書雜誌的利潤是相當驚人的。隨便舉兩個例：原本生活雜誌的定價，最近雖已漲到美金十五元一年，算起來每期不過美金三角，書舖以二〇二〇結匯購進，成本是國幣六百元，但市面上却賣到一千八百元左右，毛利百分之二百！再以最近大批到滬的「袖珍書」來講，原價美金二角五分，加上郵費或運費，成本也不到美金三角，售出時有的賣一千五百元，毛利也是近百分之二百！這是說的零售方面的利益，還有顧客委託代定的，如果不直接付美金，書舖一概照黑市折收，這樣他們在匯率方面，又賺了一筆。至於遇到有特殊的交易，利益更是驚人。記者有一天遇到一位時裝公司的朋友，據說最近他們許多同業，託某一家書店，向美國方面定了些專門關於時裝的雜誌，價格是六千元一本。而這種雜誌的原價，不過美金五角，換句話說，西書舖老闆所化的成本，不過國幣一千多元。</p>
<p>雖然西書業的利潤，這樣優厚，但業中人還是不很滿足，他們在訴說資本大而週轉慢的苦處，有一位老闆說：「與其拿五六千萬元來開一家西書店，還不如去做另外的生意，就是放放拆息，也儘够了。」所以現在幾家規模比較大的，大都是有相當歷史的老店，要不然，就是對西書有興趣的朋友所開設，其目的不儘在於賺錢。</p>
<p>至於雜誌中銷路最好的是「生活」與「時代」，其次爲各式各樣的電影雜誌，書籍中則以價廉物美的「袖珍書」，擁有最多的顧客。（凡士）</p>

<p>據悉，昨日下午二時，颱風位置在北緯三一五，東經一三三，向北西北進行，但有轉向東北傾向，速度已增加至每小時十二海浬以上。日本南鹿兒島長崎一帶，已進入颱風勢力範圍以內，假定走向東北方向，則將有襲擊朝鮮南部及日本海之間，預測我國東海沿岸，或可避免進襲，外灘氣象台已高懸六號信號，入晚燈光燦然。</p>
<p>上海氣象台報告云：熱帶氣流滿佈全國及東海，太平洋氣流尚穩定於日本東北部，中心位置在北緯三一·五度，東經一三三·〇度，三十哩範圍內，向北北西至北偏西進行。「天氣豫測」黃海：曇，霾清勁北風，海浪尚巨暴，沿海有霧，華中：曇至局部雷陣，中度不定向風，揚子流域有晨霧。上海：曇，尚晴而熱，有霾，揚子下游有雷陣，中度東風至不定向風。東海：北部陰有陣雨，清勁至强勁北風，海浪巨曇，南部曇，沿海霧，清勁西風至南風，巨暴至中度海浪，九洲四周有旋風暴雨及巨浪。「廿九日溫度」：最高八九·五度，最低七八·二度</p>

<h3>經濟部特派員辦公處　性質係執行機構　不决定任何辦法　昨特發表接收處理統計</h3>
<p>關於本市敵偽工廠接收處理情形，昨據經濟部蘇浙皖區特派員辦公處負責人談稱：本處係於上年九月十七日成立，距日本投降時期約一個月，在教部接收敵偽工廠時，即發現一部份工廠設備物資，已遭盜竊損失，本處每接收一廠，均列有原始清册，由本處接收人員與日方點交人員，分別負責蓋章，以作初步根據，其後本處派員清查，倘發現內部設備與原始清册不符，復另立點交清册，除追查不符原因外，另參照以上兩清册，造具比較清册，作爲保管根據。本處先後計接收工廠六四六單位，移交經濟部附屬機關接管復工者一三三單位，尚餘三一七單位，正在進行處理中。本處辦理接收處理工作，係受敵偽產業處理局委託，爲一執行機構，不決定任何辦法，例如標售工廠時所有估價開標，決標等手續，均由處理局決定產權，經審議通過後，如通知本處辦理，並由處理局派員監督點交。至於發還原業主之工廠，如日本人增添設備，除將原有部份點交外，關於收歸國有物資部份，估價標售事項，仍係由處理局決定。本處與處理局間公文往復，不免需時，外界人士不明，每指摘本處對發還工廠，有意延宕，絕非事實。最後並稱：本處承辦敵偽工廠接收保管運用各項事務，向極慎重，且凡事必經敵偽產業處理局決定，而後辦理，手續上錯誤甚少，惟本處職員衆多，亦難免良莠不齊，有假借職權，從中作弊情事，希望社會人士，多與本處取得密切聯繫，以利檢舉，如對接收工作發生疑問時，亦望隨時來處查詢。</p>

<h3>本市田賦徴實　可望折現　已呈政院糧部請示</h3>
<p>自九月一日起，收復區田賦將開始繳實，記者昨訪市財政當局，探詢本市田賦徴實準備情形，據告，本市田賦，係初次開征，惟土地多爲市　,其農作面積共僅五十餘萬畝（包括河島），稻麥在作物中佔最少數。以前敵偽時期，高額徴實，亦僅年征起米糧四百四十餘石，而人口稠密，消費龐大，民食素仰鄰封，向來田賦，皆以錢幣繳納，人民習慣已久，本市輿論亦不以徴實爲然。同時倉庫儲運旣無設備，經徴人員亦乏訓練，徴實一事在技術上易生流弊。故本市田賦，擬按照田賦徴收實物條例第三條之規定，折徴法幣，以利推行，現正分呈行政院，糧食部請示中。記者詢以將來如折徴法幣，究係何項標準徴收。據告不外採用下列三種方式：（一）以市價做標準，（二）由市府規定價格，（三）以某時期糧食平均價格爲準。至於賦額，照最近中央規定，每畝賦額戰前一元，應折殺四斗，外徴借四斗，另加三成市公糧合計九斗二升。</p>

<h3>在張之洞的故第訪馮友蘭</h3>
<p>— 本報本平記者　宋紹柏</p>
<p>細雨濛濛中，記者去後海右岸訪問行將赴美講學的淸華大學文學院院長馮友蘭先生。馮先生由渝到平纔四天，記者叩門的時候，恰値馮先生和夫人由外歸來。五十多歲的馮先生、已經留了四五寸長的滿腮黑鬍鬚，配上一幅深近視眼鏡，穿一件白綢長衫，頗有道士之風。夫人年歲輕，胖胖的，似乎是在朋友家徒步歸來。經過一度探詢，馮先生客氣地讓記者進去。兩節院中住了四五家馮先生的親戚朋友，所以就零亂得很。馮先生住在最後的一排房，這是一所很壯觀的深宅大院，它的最初主人，是張之洞，一並排三個院落，事變前馮先生買了中間的住宅。馮先生這樣說，並指着北頭的一間：「張之洞便死在那間房」。馮先生的兒女正在整理書物，此房雖淪陷了八年，但馮先生的書物幸福而還未遺失。</p>
<p>悼惜聞一多</p>
<p>坐在一張古老的沙發裏，最先我們談到了聞一多的被暗殺，馮先生表示這是中國學術界不可挽救的損失。他說：「受過西洋文學藝術的訓練，而研究本國文學藝術最有成績的，是聞先生。此外雖有，但沒人赶得上聞光生的成就。他對唐詩·楚詞·詩經·周易，雖寫了不少東西，但總沒有整理在一起，這未竟的工作，淸華國文學系是應當爲他整理的」。關於聞先生的政治興趣，據說：「原來他接近國家主義派，到淸華後，便不再理會政治，埋頭於研究，到昆明後的一二年甚至不讀報，但近二三年因爲不滿於政局，便又對政治發生了興趣，結果是如此！」馮先生又說：「五月廿五我離開昆明的前一夜，我們還在一起」。</p>
<p>對現局看法</p>
<p>由聞一多的死，談到了時局，馮先生客氣而慎重的不多表示，他變為國共有着根本矛盾在，並且說，任何國家都有急進與缓進的不同力量，打倒與維持的對抗政黨，而不像中國的互不信任之甚，所以對於國共的接近，馮先生認爲確是困難，但最終是「應當調合的」，這只有建築在亙相讓步上。馮先生說，他對政治不感興趣，原因他以爲一個人的精神時間有限，專一於一種學間事業的研究，或可有成，兼顧太多，便不容易。</p>
<p>評北平學潮</p>
<p>對於北平各大校的接收所引起的學潮，馮先生認為一部分人堅持維持原校的歷史，精神，與傳統，是對的。馮先生認爲師範大學應復原，就師大的歷史規模看，是應當的，不過現在全國皆無師大組織，這也許是敎部不改師院為師大的困難所在。總之他的看法，歷史與規模等條件够的學校，當局是不曾阻止其發展的。</p>
<p>八月中赴美</p>
<p>馮先生將於八月中離平赴滬，轉乘輪船，去美國費省的本薛文尼大學，講「中國哲學史」一年，夫人同去。據馮先生說：赴美講學，是一年前約定的，所以雖値淸華復員，也不好不踐約。在美講學的收入，月約四五百元美金。</p>
<p>記者叩問了馮先生幾年來的研究工作，他說：這幾年在後方整理出版的，有「新理學」，「新事論」，「新世訓」，「新原人」，「新原道」，最近準備出版的有「新知言」，業父商務付印。這時旁邊的一位類似馮先生的後輩說：「研究哲學有如此偉大成就的，還沒有第二個人！」馮先生連說「那裏那裏！」河南音調依然。</p>
<p>談到重回北方的感想，馮先生很愉快地說：「我們比較宋晋人是幸遝多了，他們南渡後便未能回來，而我們却回來了，這是史上空前的事！」</p>
<p>復員的困難，馮先生也不勝其感慨，他說：我們以前等飛機，是非坐上不算數，而近來更進了一步，非下來不算數，因爲坐上以後往往又折回的。原定去冬復員的聯大三校，到今天還未復員內戰的混亂，影響了一切。對時局雅不欲表示意見的馮先生，也搖首感喟了。記者辭出時，見有他一位多年朱見的學生來問安。（　三五，七·二四。）</p>

<p>四聯總處爲配合國策，穩定鹽價，安定鹽民生計，特舉辦業務貨欵，成立貸款銀團，辦理生產　運及運輸工具各種貸款，又爲增加生產，充裕民食，穩定糧價起見，復舉辦麥貸，成立麥貸銀團，同時分組盬貸麥貸審核委員會，負責審核仆款事宜，兩委員曾已於昨日（二十九日）午前十時，在四聯分處會議室同時舉行成立會議，四聯總處徐秘書長柏園奉派來滬主持，到兩委員會委員霍亞民，王紫霜。蔡公椿。潘久芬。朱通九。薛迪錦黄蔭普·沈鏡·　務總局陳如金·糧食部汪君良·及來賓趙棣華·卞白眉·林鳳苞·沈熙瑞等二十餘人，由徐秘書長主席，徐氏首說明成立意義，並報吿四聯總處主席及宋副主席三大指示，（一）辦理要週密　實，適合時宜，切實有效（二）原則要公開，公平，公道，（三）目的在利國，利人，利已，徐氏就此三點加說明，希望兩會同人切實遵行，繼由陳如金·霍亞民·林鳳苞·卞白眉·汪君良·趙　華·沈熙瑞·潘久芬等分別表示意見，隨討論提案，幷規定於二十九日及三十日，分別如集兩審核委員會議，關於鹽貸麥貸之放欵，隨時由審核委員會遵照四聯總會處理事會核示之原則，决定辦法，交由貸款銀團，儘先承放，以免延擱，鹽貸審核委員會主任委員，已經宋副主席指派四聯放欵委員會主任委員霍亞民氏兼任，麥貸審核委員會主任委員及副主任委員則由交通銀行總經理趙棣華，農民銀總經理李叔明兼任，又據四聯總處徐秘書長談兩種貸欵核辦經過如下，</p>
<p>鹽貸試辦六個月</p>
<p>本年五月間該處奉主席副主席諭，鹽務放欵應具整個辦法，遵經函請鹽政總局提供整個辦法以便統籌去後，嗣准鹽政總局函復，略以目前國內一般局勢，尚未安定，各地鹽區情况各殊，鹽業固賴金融調劑，而貸欵必期保障安全，擬先從銷區最廣，用欵最多，比較安全之川鹽區及淮區（　即長江流域）辦起，試辦六個月，届時視情勢演進，再行調整，幷擬列貸欵總額四百九十四億元，分爲（一）生產貸欵一百二十四億元（　二）鹽運貸款三百十僞元，（　三）運輸工具貸款六十億元，經即先後提奉理事會議核定貸額爲四百五十億元，（將原列生產貸款部份之淮北淮南山東等區五十億元暫予除去）由各行局籌組銀團，邀同各商業行莊參加舉辦，嗣後經迭次邀請各行局及鹽政總局代表商訂聯貸審核委員會組織規程，及××區鹽貸銀團組織規程，提奉七月十一日第三一一次理事會議决議，分別修正通過後，函請各行局及鹽政總局推派代表共同籌組。昨下午鹽貸審委已召集首次會，研究貸款方針，對期限·利息·對象·方式等，作具體決定，主要者食鹽生產及運銷爲限，對融通性質之貸放，予以限制，先由監政局負責作初步審核，再由銀團復核，並作事後稽核，以期縝密，俾食鹽品質改良，鹽民負担减輕，國庫收入增裕，最後幷計劃重慶漢口兩地銀團之成立。（定名川康區食鹽銀團總額爲一七二億元）</p>
<p>麥貸總額三百億</p>
<p>四聯總處以鑑於本年度新麥業經登塲，爲配合政府糧食政策，協助各麵粉廠及時採購原料，積極生產，以便充裕民食，穩定糧價起見，爰經指定交通農民兩行，邀同各行局及有關主管機關，曁麵粉工業公會代表，迭次商討，先就第四區各廠舉辦貸款，協助購麥，並參照盬務總貸款案，擬具組織銀團辦法，一併提奉七月十一日第三一一次理事會議核定辦理麥貸三百億元，並通過麥貸審核委員會及麥貸銀團組織規程，分轉各行局及各有關機關，推派代表共同籌組。</p>
<p>以上兩事關係國計民生至鉅，一方面維持生產者，一方面維持消費者，尤其麥貸辦理得宜，使糧食有計劃的調度，對糧食公賣制度，均有莫大帮助。</p>
<h3>黃金存款　一週起在滬兌付或鈔或金可任擇</h3>
<p>抗戰期間，政府爲防止通貨膨脹，抑平物價起見，曾由中央銀行舉辦以法幣折合黄金存款方法，由後方各行局實施，購者踴躍。茲據確悉：政府爲便利購買此項黄金存單之存戶記見，定下週一起，一律可在上海各行局，以托收方式代兌，無論國幣或黄金，悉聽客戶之便。</p>
<h3>金鈔均跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨旣受美鈔方面之套賣，復遭來源之壓迫，毫無生氣，晨開已退爲一九一萬五，此價尚爲賣戶所包圍，開後繼續降至一八九萬五左右，十時後中央對登記之七七條，以一八九萬五之價配售，此後更爲平庸，始終在一八九萬至一九〇萬間掙扎，近午始越過一九〇萬關，午後初穩繼回，先見一九一萬光量，最後仍退至一八九萬五左右，結果較上週六又跌三萬，飾金念萬〇三，紋銀平，銀元俄挫，暗折息價仍自一角至一角半不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔有實貨流出，中途較爲遜色，但脫金換鈔者，頗有活動，低後亦易回上，昨市晨開二五一〇元有賣，港方來源供給，不久即退至二四七〇元，始有套買維持，午刻微挺至二五〇〇元左右盤旋，午後初穩後阿，自二五一〇元左右退入二五〇〇元內，結果較上週六下跌四十元，港票賣買價稍吿拔開，結果微升二元，美滙英滙羅比港電均與上週六相同。</p>
<p>統丙微降</p>
<p>公債形勢平穩，成交稍活，晟開稍挫，近午始升起少許，統丙晨開七〇〇元左右，始有維持，午收升至七五〇元盤旋，結果較上週六微降二十元，其他各債無甚榮辱。</p>
<h3>華股盤旋　外股冷落</h3>
<p>華股情形飄怱，有力份子先進後出，近午挺後稍回，中途形勢稍有曲折，先低後高，永紗低價六五五元，美亞四二五〇元，景福二四五元，新光二三八元，勤興一七五元，近午最俏時永紗六九〇元，美亞四四七〇元，景福二六〇元，新光二五五元，勤興一九〇元，近午收時實力派脫售少許，突有同降，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福新光勤興五熱門均與上週六相彷彿，較冷各中小型以及元老股均乏多大變化，信和開做新股，與換股前相差不多。</p>
<p>外股仍乏振作，上塲時微見穩定，怡紗八九〇〇元買進，英聯九〇〇〇元亦有人要，但臨收仍感軟化，結果與上週六相較，對會德豐怡紗英聯三大熱平平，　者微挫半成左右，交易更少，冷落異常。</p>
<h3>紗市依然軟弱　花布交易稀少</h3>
<p>昨日紗市疲態未除，廿支雙馬同行互做交易雖抬高二萬，然實銷沉寂，客帮迄少動辦，中小型紗貶售有人，受主殊　，價反降一二萬，細紗亦乏振作之氣象，午時紡建照例掛牌開紗，四十二支未有配售，廿支僅立馬與陽　兩牌，貨額仍極有限，</p>
<p>昨日現棉市況平疲，交易甚為稀少，緣多數廠商鑒於邇來美棉下跌甚厲，仍懷觀望態度，僅鴻章及南通大生紗廠略有採辦，普通米特林花三四百包，花號互做烏拉圭花三四百包。</p>
<p>布市實銷沉寂，人心趨下，龍頭　嘰午後下跌二百五十元至五百元，現貨成交甚少。</p>
<h3>法越凍結法幣存款　携帶匯兌石橋限制</h3>
<p>法駐越北專員公署發言人廿七日宣稱：不論任何國籍人民旅居於越南各地時，每人限帶越幣一千元。旅越華僑，凡欲匯款返國以濟家用者，每戶每月以越幣五千元爲限，並須經由東方匯理銀行，與中法銀行承兌，所有商業匯款以二千五百元越幣爲限，亦以上述兩銀行爲限，又據中央社記者獲悉，所有華僑存於河內海防兩地中國交通兩銀行之國幣存款，經當局要求，已予凍結，不准提取，但仍准以此　凍結國幣存款匯返國內，此舉目的，在減少國幣關金，在越南之流通，以穩定越南之通貨幣値，凍結國幣總計約在二十億元左右。</p>
<h3>糧價審議略有減低　植物油廠繼續配售</h3>
<p>社會局糧食審議會昨日下午三時循例召開第十一次平價審議會，出席社會局糧食課長吉明齋，臨參會代表趙公然，糧食商張錫潮蔡聲明王炳坤趙行潔印福祥等，經討論結果，（一）維持原價者白粳六萬四千元，薄稻六萬四千元，羊秈六萬三千元，（二）重經審議者，埠秈五萬六千元，（原五萬八千元）門售六萬一千元，碾幣五萬一千元，（原五萬三千元）門售五萬六千元，白秈四萬六千元，（原五萬元）門售五萬零五百元，以上所寨訂價格雖已較上次爲低，但仍較市上價格爲高，其原因爲鼓勵米商採運，增厚米糧存底，今日一律照價應市，且因糧食市况日趨正軌，現市米價迄未變更，故社會局召開審議日期略有更改，每逢星期三五，作為平價審議日云。</p>
<p>南北市塲昨到一萬餘石，白粳消化零星，市俏次疲，秈米供過於求，呆滯之極，亦呈提高殺次之局，白元店方選高拾取，尚稱活絡，中次亦少問津，粉市聞傳有開禁之說，人心向榮，價升五六百元，小麥散戶外帮因船位短少，無意進取，成交瘳瘳，市形特疲，　皮貨稀見挺，廠方小麥亦隨粉價提升六七百元，黃豆新貨續到，市勢平平，油市未開盤，場外交易生油高喊至八萬八千至八萬九千元，豆油價為八萬四千元，據悉經濟部中國植物油廠存底亟爲充沛，故決儘量穩定油價，昨日該廠仍以每擔六萬八千元價配售生菜油七百桶，較市價每擔低廉六千元，今日并將繼續配售云。</p>
<h3>茶市內銷甚暢</h3>
<p>泗安抽珍新貨，刻下祗有印商裕隆洋行吸進廿四箱，價每擔廿萬零五千元，係新華茶廠售出，此外英商協和洋行則進陳中祁門七十二箱，價每擔七萬七千元，至於內銷，依然甚暢，汪裕泰辦陳次祁門二百箱，又婺源陳次炒靑四百零四簍，同時山東帮扒取中珠蘭五十簍，他若陳頂祁門，臺灣紅茶，玉山新炒靑，新龍井等，太街店莊及客帮俱有去化，各檔行情均挺。</p>
<h3>臺灣存糖廿一萬噸　運輸不便公司損失甚大</h3>
<p>台灣糖業公司目前面臨之最大困難厥爲運輸阻滯，台省糖產接管委員會副主任委員曾昭承昨吿記者，「基隆港現已存糖一萬噸無法運輸出口。倉庫旣小，倉租復昂，公司方面之損失頗大。」台糖全賴招商局之船隻運輸至滬，記者復訪此間招商局經理陳德坤，渠稱：近兩週來，由滬駛台之船隻計有四千噸，均供他用。未來一週內亦無船運糖出口。台糖公司接收日人存糖十五萬噸，自接收迄今，自產八萬六千噸，但直至本年五月，台糖始首次運輸出口，至今共運滬之糖數，爲一萬九千二百噸。目前台省尚有存糖二十一萬六千八百噸。曾昭承氏稱：存糖無法運出，以致台糖公司之資金週轉不靈，目前該公司係賴合灣銀行之貸款維持業務，渠認爲倘運輸問題解決，每月運量可超過行政院所希望之數額一萬噸。</p>
<h3>十糖微挫</h3>
<p>昨糖市因傳潮靑又有裝出，略見挫落，號貨汕幫開出提靑九萬〇五千元至九萬元，黃崗靑八萬八千元，降去一二千元，足三尖十四萬三千元，成交百數十包，興化幫開上貢粉白十三萬二千元至十三萬元十二萬七八千元，次十一萬四五千元，興化赤十一萬四五千元至十一萬二三千元，共百餘簍。</p>
<h3>優先後方工業界　標售敵偽工廠　七折作價　分期付款</h3>
<p>敵偽產業處理局，接收敵僞工廠，除已標賣六十八家，其餘芷繼續標賣，可能撥數十家照原估價七折售予後方工業家，并准予分期付款，以示優待，按分期付款辦法係第一期先付全數三分之一，半年後交第二期款，全數定一年內付淸，至後方工業家所堅決要求無條件承辦敵僞工廠一事，恐難照辦，而關於後方工業家抗戰有功名單，近正由經濟部與有關方面商擬中。</p>
<h3>民生輪由滬駛渝載往大批棉紗布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民生公司民本輪，修竣復航，原定明晨自滬直駛重慶，乘客不多，商貨甚夥，棉紗棉布約五百餘件，五金什貨甚多，停泊於外灘十二號碼頭，昨日晝夜裝貨，提前於今晨起椗。招商局林森輪，昨日直駛汕頭，由滬運往麥子六千一百餘包，豆子一千二百餘包，豆餅九千五百塊，棉紗八百四十餘件，以及什貨約三千餘件。江平輪昨開靑島，有米一千四百噸運去。太古公司漢陽輪今午駛靑津，原船載滬救濟署棉花一千五百噸，本市有麥子一千五百包，救濟　罐頭食物二百噸運靑鳥，天津無貨。</p>
<h3>陽泉塊已鬆動</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊自經中連輪運來大批陽泉塊後，市况即轉鬆動，並有若干同業趁高預售期貨，故陽泉塊價已退入四十萬大關，卅九萬元有賣戶，高檔貨烟煤塊各方採購頗股，市上缺貨，趨勢頗俏，市價續升，白煤層與烟煤層仍與前相仿，前者銷活，後者滯銷，柴炭自漲價後，銷路稍受影饗</p>
<h3>木材疲軟</h3>
<p>昨木材市况，因洋松續到，價稍軟疲，杉木價尚平穩，現市上因柳安存底日薄·價仍堅穩，餘均　軟疲之狀。</p>
<h3>龍口粉上展</h3>
<p>龍口綫粉干，近以到貨稀少，而去化尚活，故市熱頗緊，再度上展，客貨開盤已出二十萬大關而至二十二萬元，行盤售二十三萬元。</p>
<h3>墨西哥黃金大量到香港</h3>
<p>可能再流人中國</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港廿八日電〕前週大量黄金自墨西哥流入香港，致黃金黑市發生激烈彼動，惟一般饞勢，則傾向下游，因中國通貨不安及結匯美元稀少，故須輸人黄金，該項黄金大部或將設法運往中國內地，惟港當局則禁止黄金出口，各外商銀行行員吿合衆社記者稱，墨西哥黄金售價，每盎司爲三十六美元，港地售價則爲九十美元，前週週初港幣行市爲法幣四三〇元，週末則已跌至法幣三五八元，蓋因外間謠傳將有多數外商銀行出售四十日期貨售價較黑市爲低，結果昨夜收盤又降至法幣三六八元。</p>

<h3>廣陵七月潮</h3>
<p>— 本報牙六日揚州訊　特約記者　王公瀚</p>
<p>很顯然的，最近十多天以來，由於京滬各地報紙的報導，同時在事實上蘇北最近的局面確是烽烟處處。據悉此間一般旅居在外鄕的人，着實陡添了心事！</p>
<p>烽煙處處旅人躊躇</p>
<p>其實，揚州十多天以來所遭遇的情勢，幷不完全如某些報上所傳的以及有關心者所過慮的那麽嚴重的。然南此間一般旅居在外鄉的人，每有寫信到家，要家中人最好早點離揚州；或不計炎天跋涉之勞，特地趕回揚州來看看；表示所謂「不放心」。而另一方面尚有臨時行旅在外面的揚邑商界人士，前幾天，被傳說與「空氣」嚇得一時竟不敢貿然回到家鄉來，躊躇在京滬以及鎭江等地。這種情形，記者是最近幾天從兩位旣經回到揚城的親友們的談述中獲得了解的。而這可以想見：當此間情勢的確較緊張的那幾天，把揚州看成是「岌岌可危」了，一定還大有人在的。</p>
<p>各方鎮定沉着應付</p>
<p>現在，記者以「身在此間」的地位吿訴你吧：共軍有攻打揚城的計劃確係事實。然共軍實行「破壞揚泰公路」，「攻擊仙女廟」，「竄擾白塔河」時候，此開社會上的一般狀態倒并沒有什么慌張情形發生。相反的黨政軍警等官方，在各方面都表現着很鎭定，及洋溢着沉着應付的精神。即一般民衆也是的，雖容有「萬一的打算，」但始終沒有荒張的情事發生。這是有原因的，第一，人們有點了解駐軍的實力是曾確保揚城的治安的；第二，人們相信駐軍絕不致把揚州曾淪進共軍手中去；第三，人們明白：在地形上，揚州與鎭江僅一江之隔，其間雖有一三十來里地的「揚圩公路」，而這正是一條優良的軍事補給綫。况且，據記者知道，駐軍的本身，對於確保揚邑的治安，也是有着充份的自信的</p>
<p>咫尺共軍不足十里</p>
<p>廿一日下午，記者會見此間駐軍政治部嚴主任，他就那樣說過：『共軍就是來上十萬人攻擊揚州，我們也不買賬』！記者以爲，他這話幷非是無謂的豪語，因爲記者不才，也曾有過四年以上「禦敵防奸」的從軍經騐，根據觀察：若是把共軍的「戰鬥力」（內容包括武器配備，戰鬥人員對大塲面的戰鬥經騐等等）與國軍具有的「戰鬥力」（內容同上）相比較，國軍的確是有以少數勝共軍多數之先決的優秀條件的，和終將完全制勝共軍的把握的。至於揚州的事實，嚴主任解剖得也相當淸楚：『揚邑西北兩面郊外，共軍最接近之活動地區，如楊家廟，甘泉山，距離揚城竟不足十里，而它的力量雖不怎樣大，也有三團的兵力。而它爲什麽始終不曾再敢進越雷池一步呢？因爲，那樣做，它知道它一定不會討好；絕對不會討好！……一句話：我們嚴密堅强的佈置，它沒法進犯』！</p>
<p>縣長出巡人心相安</p>
<p>縣府方面，張縣長廿日曾視察揚泰公路中心點之宜陵鎭。（　在揚邑東鄕）縣長能跑出城區數十里地，老百姓在城區何苦再自相不安呢？「江都縣臨時參議會第二次全體會議」昨天（廿五日）起又轟轟烈烈地在城北「中山紀念堂」開慕了，參加者除了揚縣各機關首長，省方凌委員紹祖特亦由鎭至揚參加。這更加冲淡了揚邑前幾天面臨戰火的氣氛。而「臨參會」的一班「社會賢達」此番的舉動，無形中實亦給予民衆以精神的支援不少。</p>
<p>固若金湯安如磐石</p>
<p>聽說鎭江方面的情形，反倒不及揚州顯得鎮靜，本報特派員杭舟君日前由滬經鎭鎮江來到揚城後，看到此間的市面：茶社裏吃客滿座，大街上商店照常做營業，對記者就那麽說起過。而鎭江的動靜該是取決於揚州的。因此，記者對杭君提起了一件事：當泰興城一度情况不明時，此開幾家銀行不免稍嫌荒張了點，將庫存巨額款項急急運往鎭江，一部份行員又將眷屬遣送往鎭江。當時，曾引起揚城人們的注意與驚擾，但該幾家銀行立即到了社會人士的指責。因此，此間廿一日之「江都日報」曾有中央銀行揚州分行經理蔣仁宇之「此後央行無論環境如何轉變，當隨軍政當局一致行動，絕不搜自撤離」談話記載。</p>
<p>總之，關於此間的治安，不說「固若金湯」，亦可說「安如磐石」。</p>
<p>虎疫流行風聲鶴唳</p>
<p>但，在軍事的局勢能安定人心之外，揚邑有兩件事是極難呌人心安定的。一件事是霍亂的流行。據記者昨日先後晤見此間「省立揚州醫院」院長徐瑞和氏及「私立揚州協和醫院」院長葉世誠氏談：揚邑現已成爲霍亂急烈流行區，罹此惡症致死者日有數起之多。在日常，記者看人們談起此症來，每多「談虎色變」的樣子。又廿四日「臨參會」招待記者筵席上，記者同人們對虎疫流行的情形了解深刻的緣故吧？遂有這樣「凉菜」不敢吃，那樣易引蒼蠅的菜對之怯於動　的現象，大有風聲鶴唳的樣子。而結果，老饗之記者某兄，得大啖而特啖哉。</p>
<p>時局影響商業凋蔽</p>
<p>再一件事是商業凋蔽。掦邑商業受時局影響，自去冬至於今夏，一直是衰落不振，其主要的現象：四鄕八鎭的老主顧，多不見進城來買什物了了譬如一年一季熱鬧不過的「觀看香市」今年就鴉雀無聲地已那麽過去了。而綢緞店，南貨店……都俗說有一櫃台上跑老鼠」的悽慘景象。因此，最近閉歇之商店累累。一個情形——開支大進賬少，沒法再維持下去。而稅務當局照常要在其餘的猶自强自撐持塲面，實際上已是垂斃了的商店身上徴收營業稅。是以在廿一日這一天，此間產了一個「揚州商人福利互助社」的組織，在「本縣於敵偽期間，受害嚴烈，勝利以後，安定秩序之時期又最遲，目下更屆軍事時期，百業蕭條……」的理由與苦情下，此「互助社」代表揚邑全體商民將到省方去，向當局請求豁免三十四年十一月至三十五年一月份，以及本年五六七三個月之營業挽。本年二三四三個月之營業稅他們則預備照繳，惟要求政府前向揚邑商家所借之款項得歸還。記者對於此事有一點意見：希望政府繼豁免田賦的德政後，對於一再受災的揚州商業，能加體恤！否則據記者了解，此間的各業商店，勢將閉歇至於殆盡了。果爾，影響揚城治安，影響揚地人心之安定都很大。</p>

<h3>平靜的西安</h3>
<p>— 本報廿五日西安訊　特約記者　李馳寄</p>
<p>中原的戰火，終於在本月廿日蔓延人陝西的境界來了。這一方面的消息，無疑的正受此間各方嚴密的注意，幾天以來往復於東南方一角晴空的飛機，似乎比平日多，沉默了快有一年的蔚藍天，好像又煩躁起來了。</p>
<p>豫南鄂北之間的共軍李先念部，在這一個半個月以來，很明顯的正在向西移動，而河南·湖北和陝西三省的省治分界綫，本來不過是人爲的政治畫分，其間並沒有什麼高山大水作爲自然劃分的憑依。因爲在陝境內秦嶺（即終南山）和豫境伏牛山之南，或者說，陝南鄂北的漢水河谷，正是一片毗連三省的低地。觀察這方面的戰訊、應該注意到這一點。不過無論怎樣說，從住在陝西的人來看，對於省境內的槍聲，總有切膚灼肉的感覺，這是出自愛鄕土的人之常情，而老百姓日夜祈求的，又正是境泰民康！</p>
<p>從西安往東南沿着公路走，越過秦嶺上有名的「雪擁藍關馬不前」的藍蘭，就到商縣·龍駒寨和商南，而入豫境的荆紫關·浙川，再往南到達湖北的老河口。這是一條溝通陝豫鄂三省的舊路和公路，旬日以來，南段沿途的地名已先後見於電訊上的官方公報。李先念部最西行的一點，據官報說是在龍駒寨附近，從地圖上量一量直綫的距離，它大約在西安正東南兩百華里，但在其當中尚有高高的險要的秦嶺隔斷着，像一列屛障，因而這個距離里程，就沒有多大意義了。西安目下很安穩，市况如恒。</p>
<p>「軍調部」爲調解處理這方面的軍事，已派出第三十二執行小組一行六人，由老河口出發，於二十日到達龍駒寨。名單包括政府方面代表王凱亭少將，施錫枝中校，共方代表任士存中校，施谷少校，美方代表白羅索中校，何魯麥上尉。白中校途中患病，本應靜養，然終因責任心重，力疾以赴。該小組曾約李先念本人或派代表來龍駒寨會商。一行六人定廿四日取道商縣來西安，此間官方已準備歡迎。「化干戈爲玉帛」吧，老百姓總是這樣祈念着。</p>
<p>商縣，龍駒寨，商南一帶，屬本省第四行政專員區。在這一區內靠近山地的　南（在龍駒寨之北）山陽（在龍駒寨之南）和商縣之間，旬日以前，就陸續有過消息說治安欠寗大帮和若干零星的股匪出沒，裝備相當，四區專員兼淸剿司令官陳卓戡正在限期肅淸。這一批人到底純然不過是綠林鏢客抑或梁山人馬，他們與李先念部究竟有無關係，則至堪玩味。從時間和地點上探索，似乎頗難如此「偶合」。</p>
<p>在過去，曾有個時間由這條公路，輸進不少商品入陝西。但自從隴海鐵路暢通以後，因鐵路運費比公路運費低廉，運貨量從這條公路運入來的早已越來越少。是故陝南這一角目下雖有槍聲，而直接影響於市塲的尚無任何跡象·無論金融與物價，依然在穩定狀態中，這是人心安定的指標。</p>
<p>這幾天比較的悶熱，也許說是今夏中最熱的幾天，昨天下午突來暴風陣雨，雷電交作，損壞了好些電桿樹木，經過約八九十分鐘的肆暴，就雨過天靑，晚來的太陽還是那麽明朗。我不禁想起貝多芬的「田園交響曲」最後兩個樂章：在殷殷雷鳴後愈感牧笛聲音淸澈，而老百姓在祈謝田聞之重獲和平。</p>

<h3>一波三折變幻不定的歐洲和會召開經過</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>大家渴望已久的歐洲和平會議，昨天已在巴黎揭慕了。和會的召開，和約的簽訂，一面是戰爭的淸算，一面也是奠定今後和平的基礎。由於這第二次世界大戰範圍的龐大，戰後問題的複雜，所以和會分爲三個：一是對義·匈·羅·保·芬五國的；一是對德的；一是對日的。這次會議，是和平會義的序幕，主要問題，只是在討論對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國的和約，然也可說是爲他日對德對日的和約闢一途徑。我們看到這次和會的召開，事前不知經過幾番波折］可見要謀永久和平，工作是何等的艱鉅｛</p>
<p>德國的崩潰，和日本的投降，結束了戰塲上砲火的爭鬭，而轉移到樽俎間的折衝。在波茨坦會議裏，有設立五國外長會議，磋商戰後和約的決議。可是一九四五年八月倫敦中·美·英·蘇·法五國外長會議，經過二十日的努力，結果是不歡而散。十二月間，美·英·蘇三國外長，再度集議於莫斯科，企圖打開僵局，結果決定：惟有簽字於降書之會員國，才能對於五國和約參加起草，即對義和約，由英·美，蘇·法四國起草；對羅·保·匈和約，由英·美·蘇三國起草；對芬和約，由英·蘇兩國起草。一俟和約草案，準備就緒，即由參加外長會議的五會員國，及聯合國中對於反抗歐洲敵國在軍事方面曾作實際貢獻的十六個國家，舉行和平大會，作最後的討論，和會擬定本年五月一日舉行。</p>
<p>根據莫斯科會議的決定，美·英·蘇·法四國外長代表，即受命在倫敦分別起草對於五國的和約。四國外長會議，乃於四月廿五日在巴黎開會。</p>
<p>巴黎四國外長會議，自四月二十五日開幕，至五月十五日休會，經二十多天商討的結果，一部分次要問題，雖已獲得協議，但許多主要問題，仍懸而未決，相持不下。</p>
<p>（一）特港問題　蘇聯提議，伊斯特里亞半島，應劃歸南斯拉夫。美則主張特港，應歸義大利·法乃提出折衷辦法，由國際共管，英美已贊同，但蘇聯仍堅持不讓，致成懸案。</p>
<p>（二）社特喀尼斯羣島問題　英國同意，將該羣島歸還希臘，但蘇聯以爲這是義大利殖民地之一，應與義殖民地一併討論·</p>
<p>（三）義國疆界問題　法奧兩國，均與義大利領土發生糾紛，上埃第其區之一部分·已決定歸義大利保留，至法國所要求之丹特與勃利蓋兩地，俟派調查團察勘後，再行決定。</p>
<p>（四）義大利殖民地問題　蘇聯要求單獨托管的黎波里，英則主張完全獨立。法提出以聯合國名義，仍交義大利代管。美又建議採用國際代管制度。旋美蘇亦贊同法國的主張，但英國堅持必須以代管昔蘭尼加爲交換條件，遂致擱淺。</p>
<p>（五）義大利賠款問題　蘇聯要求義大利賠償蘇聯·南斯拉夫·希腦·阿爾巴尼亞，三億美元。英美咸認爲足以妨礙義大利之復興。結果，美主張蘇聯名下之一億元只賠四分之三。但蘇聯不肯接受。</p>
<p>（六）多腦河航行問題　美要求開放多腦河，英建議由國際共管，但蘇聯認爲凡多腦河沿岸諸國，均有參加討論之必要，故拒絕談判。</p>
<p>以上這許多重要的問題，旣然都不能解決，歐洲的和平，又籠罩着一層灰色的烟幕。和會前已擬定延至六月十五日召集，但蘇聯主張，在對五國和約起草，未曾解決前，不能召集。結果四國外長會議，決定展期，於一個月後再開·在一片黑暗之中，因此又透露了一綫光明。</p>
<p>一個月休會之後，四國外長於六月十五日在巴黎再度策晤。這次會議、是維特歐洲和平的關鍵，各國對它均十分重視。可是英美和蘇聊的態度，尚未改變。在開會之後，貝爾納斯的廣播演說中，强調美國舉國一致的堅定政策，但莫洛托夫則謂英美決定所採取的政策，乃是如何對付蘇聯的政策，而不在維持世界和平。許多人因而爲外長會議的前途担憂。</p>
<p>（一）特港的爭執，蘇聯仍支持南斯拉夫的要求。義大利的態度，較爲和緩，願意接受國際的調解，以公平合理的辦法來解決，但認威爾遜爲大體合理的辦法，即將特港留給義大利。旋蘇聯贊同法國皮杜爾所提特港國際化的計劃，不過指定的地域，小得可憐，且四境都在南斯拉夫包圍之中，英美當然不能同意的。皮杜爾再提出折衷的辦法，依照法國所劃的界綫，東歸南斯拉夫，西屬義大利、同時把特港國際化的區域擴大。特港問匙，遂得勉强解決。</p>
<p>（二）義大利之賠款，美國已同意蘇聯一億美元賠款的要求，惟以義大利奢華郵船兩艘抵充，如此可免妨礙義大利之生　。　　至此，乃略作讓步，表示願意接受美國之提議。至於要求賠償希臘·南斯拉夫·及阿爾巴尼亞之兩億元，則提交和會討論。</p>
<p>（三）關於義大利的殖民地，蘇聯因欲伸長其勢力於地中海，故有單獨托管的黎波里的要求。英國對於在北非已經佔領的土地，自不肯輕易放棄。這次會議中，採取避重就輕的辦法，決定義大利應放棄其對於非洲殖民地所享有之權利。英美法蘇四國，則於一年內，決定此種殖民地的法理地位，如在一年內不能商定處置辦法，則將此問題提交聯合國處理之。</p>
<p>（四）多腦河通航一點，四國已承認爲世界和平及世界貿易的利益起見，有將多腦河及其可通航的支流和運河，在各國完全平等的條件下，予以自由開放。</p>
<p>其他如義國殘餘艦隊的處置問題，義境內的英美軍隊及保加利亞境內的蘇聯軍隊問題，都獲得了協談。對義大利的問題大致均已解決，和約的起草已沒有多大困難。和會決定於七月二十九日在巴黎舉行，其未決問題，悉交和會中討論。</p>
<p>歐洲和平會議召開日期旣已決定，但在請柬發出以前，還經過相當的波折：其一是邀請國問題，另一是和會程序問題。蘇外長莫洛托夫堅主中國不應爲和會之邀請國，僅能爲被邀請國。美國務卿貝爾納斯當塲駁斥，認爲這是對中國的一種侮辱，我國王外長也提出嚴正的聲明。英美曾一度接受了蘇聯的主張，但結果蘇聯在各國輿論壓力之下，放棄了固執的態度，承認中國爲和會主席團之一，和會由中美英蘇法五國外長會議名義召集。關於和會的程序，也經過一番爭執。蘇聯主張和會程序，應由四强決定，隨請柬一同發出。但英美則堅決表示和會程序應由廿一國全體大會作最後的決定。結果，還是採用折衷的辦法，由外長會議決定原則數條，以建議方式，分致與會各國，供其採納。法國政府以地主之地位，代表五國，於七月九日將請柬發出。召開和會的許多週折，到此方算吿一段落。</p>
<p>經過這許多困難而召開的廿一國歐洲和平會議，今天總算是實現了。希望在和會中能得到滿意的收穫。這不僅是參與折衝的外長具有此心，就是全世界的人民也同有此願望。</p>

<h3>這一夜的故事</h3>
<p>— 朱理惺</p>
<p>—爲紀念大作曲家Wolfgang　Amadeus　Mozart寫之一—</p>
<p>「貝多芬是偉大的，但，但是我們的摩渣呀！摩渣簡直是直古以來絕無僅有的偉大的，偉大的音樂家！」這是世界名作曲家之一的義大利音樂家羅西尼（Rossini）發現一册摩渣的遺作，在那頁最後的空白上，淸楚地留着當時這位空前絕後的大音樂家——摩渣——的跋語，因此，他恍然領悟到當年的這一闋小詩，也是經過一種人類最高貴的同情感而激發起純凈的博愛精神，配合着他那天賦的才智，終於寫下了那一頁，由此，他——羅西尼——更確定了摩渣的所著，根本可以說已經超過了樂藝的範圍，純粹的說，那不是音樂，那是完完全全不折不扣的「詩」。這一闋如此，他所遺留給我們的一切的遺音，又何嘗不然。</p>
<p>羅西尼所發現他這一闋附有跋記的一頁，是在羅西尼一生中僅見一次的奇蹟，所以也無怪羅西尼把眼淚給引出了許多許多，嗣後羅西尼覺得能瞻仰到摩渣的親筆跋語是上帝賦予和鼓勵他追慕先賢的啓示，而後他窮二年零八個月的苦功與心得，寫下了舉世聞名的大歌劇（Opera：Wiling　Tell）。用以報上蒼創造摩渣而垂其遺昔於萬世不朽的宏恩。</p>
<p>這一闋，就是（Serenade：Eeine　Nacht－Musik）這一夜的小曲。四節奏鳴之後，大作曲家，我們的摩渣寫下如此的跋誌：</p>
<p>「明月被一陣黑雲抹過之後，梧桐的影子顯得格外的淸澈了，可是當明月的光亮被掩沒的時候，有誰能想到梧桐的寂寞，以及世界上一切被黑暗所掩抹的生物的靈魂呢！於是，我由於腹稿的倉猝，用石筆把曲譜雜亂地寫出來，這是一個Sereade，分四節，當我用三角琴匆匆的把它演奏完畢，這時候皎潔的月光，已爬到樹頭的那邊，我開始昏昏然欲睡了。</p>
<p>「一抬眼，在這寂靜的宇宙裏，芸芸衆生看不出誰遭遇着悲憤的氣息，樹枝隨風飄動，晚花帶着寒意的淸查，我想我是一個生物中最有靈魂的人，我於是感覺到人生是多麼的可愛呀，上帝創造了我們，我們也已創造了世界上的一切，這顆樹，那堆花，全是在五年前，由我把它們灌溉培植以至於今日，果然，它們也已分享到世界上生靈的呼吸垂五年之久了。想到這裏，我又從睡眼惺忪中展開我的Serenade，又慢慢的打開了三角琴，把剛剛所以爲必須修改時，趁在這個充滿了「愛」的世界裏，使它變成一個更爲美滿的詩章。</p>
<p>「一曲旣畢，月色西斜，四顧無人，寂靜中難免有些孤獨，在微風煦拂中我回頭看那梧桐樹下的北角，迎着月色站住一位身穿素服的婦人，我不知道她是什麼時候走近這裏來的，一定眼看去，她慢慢地移步向我身旁走過來，雙手執着一塊布帽拭住眼睛，從風中送來一絲輕微的泣聲，等走近我的時候，我發現她已是一位七十開外的老太太，慢慢地，她把雙手放下，似乎不由自主的從我身上撲過來，她變手緊緊的執着我的兩臂，抬起頭來，眼淚撲漱漱的像雨水般掉下來了，我已明瞭這一定不是奇突的相逢，我已經好像自已覺得我必須用一種最誠摯的心情，安慰她所欲向我傾吐的一切了。</p>
<p>「「好孩子啊！上帝，你是從那裏來的呢！你怎麼把我所欲的一切，完完全全代爲向這個世界奏鳴了出去的呢！孩子啊，你聽我講一個簡短的故事，然後再把它在你的曲子裏插進一些去罷，」老太太雙手緊執我的兩臂，慢慢地說着。</p>
<p>「昨天晚上我方由義大利回到家園，它和我分別已快三十年了，那兌我得到我的兒子陣亡的消息確實之後，我再也在這裏耽不下去，我於是流浪到義大利去的，在我臨別家園的晚上，我爲了戀戀不捨的心情，我在這裏用嗚咽的泣聲，哼着紀念我丈夫的倩影，哀悼我兒子的爲國捐軀，當時恍惚我記得我所哼的調子，正像你剛剛所奏的那個，但，孩子啊！三十年前，你是否已經　在這裏把我的　子　了去呢！我　，那個時候，你也許還沒有出世哪！」</p>
<p>「「我告訴你，我親愛的　子，我今年已經七十四歲了，我離開　圍三十年，四十四年的歲月裏我始終住在我這裏可愛但是更可傷心的家園，三十年前，當我離去這裏的時候，只有抬頭看見那明月是一樣的外，其餘一切都改了樣子了，可是我記得，我永遠的記得，並且我已經記在心裏將近六十年，那就是在我未生產我那爲麗捐軀的兒子之前，這裏也間樣有一颗梧桐樹，那邊也有一堆芍藥花，可是，將近六十年來，我已經從希望中得到絕望的實事，啊！那渺不可追的五十八年！」她已經把　泣變成絕望的微笑，但是我却流下了眼淚。</p>
<p>「「五十八年前，我是個十六歲的孩子，到今天我仍記得像今晚一樣的明月之夜，我的剛結婚才四天的丈夫，　着我的手，踱步在這樣一顆的梧桐樹下，我偎着他的下頷，雙雙的從這裏坐下來，他呌我跟隨哼着他嘴裏所唱出來的詩，一唱一和的把這個世界添上了多少的活躍，但是，啊，我的孩子，五十八年前。你在那裏的呢！剛剛你所奏的，確確實實從當時我們那裏偷聽來的只少了一點點小部份，不過，我們當時所沒有唱出來的，你如今也把它放進去了，啊，上帝，天下眞有道種怪事嗎？」老太太露着奇異的目光，慈祥地向我說：</p>
<p>「「從那晚上起，敵我之戰看上去是眞的難免了，却不料第三天的淸晨，我那二十歲的丈夫，新婚才只一星期的丈夫，換上了戎裝出征去了，從此，當每天明月的來臨，我獨自慢步的走到這裏，嘴上哼着這個曲子，心中在祁求上帝的佑護，希望他能早日光榮的歸來，我希望着，我每天晚上如此的希望着，五十八年來，在如此一段流水的光陰裏，我還同樣的敎會我的兒子哼着這個他那暫時不回來，而且從未見過一面的父親所唱的曲子，繼着第二次的戰爭爲國捐軀了，我的兒子，是一個遺腹子，但我直到今天仍然希望他的父親能够帶着蒼蒼的白髮，抖擻精神的歸來，因爲直到今天我還不相信他不會回來的，可是，兒子確實已經陣亡了，啊！我那年靑俊秀的丈夫，迄今究竟不知道居住在天的那一方。」</p>
<p>「「在我丈夫出征的前夜，他和我雙雙的仍來這顆梧桐樹下，哼着這個調子，他吿訴我說生命是有限的，藝術却永垂千古，果眞我一旦爲國捐軀，你——那就是我——你不妨每天晚上仰着明月哼着這一曲子，在希望我光榮的歸來，一天不回來，一個月總要回來的，一個月不回來，一年總要回來的，一年不回來，十年總要回來的，十年不回來，那末，二十年三十年四十年五十年……一萬年也總要回來的，所以你不妨在希望裏，永遠哼着這一曲望我回來，可是，啊！今天，我的好孩子，光陰已經像流水般的五十八年過去了，長成了二十三歲的兒子也繼之而去了，誰還能信他倆父子能雙雙的歸來呢！但，我的孩子啊！我就能在這悠久的五十八年中，直到今天也還滿懷着希望，盼着我的丈夫，我的兒子突然的歸來，可是，在他倆未回來之前，却已經由你的奏嗚把我的希望再延長五十八年，啊，我的孩子，生命是多麼的有限啊！請你設罷，你說他們還會回來麼？」她說到這裏，眼淚已經哽住了喉嚨，我不忍再聽下去，但，但我決意把這段凄涼的遭遇插進了她所述的五十八年前的這段故事。</p>
<p>「從這晚上起，我兩天沒有進食，兩晚上沒有安眠，我用我最大的熱忱和努力，把這章Serenade寫成全部凄惻的敍述，同時，在最後的一節裏我仍舊把「希望」妥妥的爲她安置好了，一個多月來，每天夜晚，我總帶了這具三角琴，扶着這位老太太：走向那顆我所手植的梧桐樹下，奏鳴這曲故事，並且奏到末了的「希望」一節，我接二速三的直奏到她感覺再等五十八年是可能和他們重逢的時候，才使她欣然的回家睡覺去，然而，今天她却無疾的撤手歸去了。</p>
<p>「生命是有限的，可是五十八年來，她總在「希望」中渡過這段流水似的光陰，五十八年不能算短，「希望」終是永生不滅的，這就是我記這段EineKleine　Nacht－Musik，Serenade的樂章。」</p>

<h3>寫作與生活</h3>
<p>— 方無知</p>
<p>在新一卷二期的「靑年界」看到趙景深先生的「談作文」，其中有「你別寫你所不知道的東西」這麽一句，我認這句話是每個初學寫作的人都應該誌之座右的信條。因爲世界上任何一部名著，都是以作者自己十分熟悉的題材寫出的，如法捷耶夫的「毁滅」，柴霍甫的「憎惡」等，沒有一部故事的背景，不是他們所熟悉的。他們有了熟悉的題材，再配以天才的組織和描寫，才能產生出那些生動的東西。換句話說：是因爲他們權威的天才，配合着特殊的描寫底本領的原因。</p>
<p>一個生長在上海這個國際性的都市裏的作家，如果要想寫巴山蜀水的風景，或是滇黔的人民生活，任他絞盡腦汁，寫破了千萬枝筆，也不會像模像樣；即使成功了一部著作，也決不會寫得生動過眞使人感動的！這樣說來，一個作家要想寫他以前所不知道的東西，惟一的可能，便只有親身去體騐一下所要想描寫的環境中的生活，特意投身到某一個懷抱裏去詳細研究。因此，這便是要談的「寫作與生活」的問題了。</p>
<p>一個文藝工作者，要開拓文藝路綫，要想創造出他嶄新的作品，必須充實自己的經騐，專心研究現實，留心日常的生活。惟有配合自己的現實生活，寫出自己所站在的階層裏特具風格的鬥爭文學，才會永遠成功。如果一個初學寫作的人，剛寫會了幾篇故事，或者幾首詩的時候，便自視爲文化人，而想擺脫原有的生活環境，專門去過單調的文化生活，這就證明了他十足不懂得「文藝寫作要和現實生活相配合」的意義，永遠也不會成功。現在多少靑年文藝朋友們，正因爲存着這種見解，往往與現實生活解體，而放棄了寫作途徑。要知道一個文藝工作者，決不能輕視自己的地位，因爲環境愈惡劣，寫作材料便愈多，愈眞實，在田野裏，在礦坑中，同樣可以寫出優美的偉大的作品。</p>
<p>總之，一個文藝工作者，應該在工作中不斷的學習與觀察環境，在環境中去獵取最熟悉最典型的寫作題材。翁格司曾說過：「創作和作家的風格，依照我的觀察看來，所謂寫實主義，正是精細描寫，和摘取現實環境中的現實故事。除此以外，便描寫眞實的生活，表達典型環境中的典型性格了。……」</p>
<p>現在我們社會上流行着一句非常通俗的話，就是當我們談到了某一個精神勝利者的時候，總比方他是阿，因爲阿是一個大家知道的典型精神勝利者，當然　們談到這種人的時候，只有拿阿和他相比，最爲配合。但要知道爲什麽是這樣的呢？因爲魯迅先生會觀察現實，與現實生活相符合，他觀察了好多類同的性格，方　創出了文學上的典型。</p>
<h3>說書人</h3>
<p>— 弋</p>
<p>說書人，用一塊小小的長方醒木，藉一張巧言如簧，天花亂數的嘴，在許多昏迷的人羣裏，滔滔不倦地開放着他的如黄河決口般的深邃的話匣子。</p>
<p>一頭　髪是難得見他淸理過一番的，永遠是那末亂蓬蓬地。在他的二道稀疏的眉毛下·一雙暗淡而無神的目光，是蘊藏着無限的心底的憂鬱。他是夙藉他的一張豪放奔流的嘴把他心底所有的憂鬱吐露出來嗎？</p>
<p>他是一個落拓不羈的閒人，但也是一個憂國愛民的志士。他在廣漠的昏迷的人羣裏高歌，在呼；他也在廣漠的昏迷的人羣裏指點和哀訴。他高歌這人羣之所以値得高歌者；他在呼道人羣之所以應當在呼者；他指點這人羣應走的大道；他也哀訴這人羣之使人悲戚者。他更用他的那塊永遠隨着他的長方醒木當頭痛擊着一般昏迷不醒的人們。</p>
<p>但是人羣是那麽固執不悟，他們的昏迷注定了他們平庸的命運。他們只是張大了限睛，堅直了耳朶，毫無感覺毫無目的地看着聽着說書人動人的舉動和悅耳的聲音，從他的年靑時候一直看到聽到他的頭髮變得花白，嗓子變得蒼啞。他們聽的是說書人的故事，說書人用醒木在桌子上拍了一下感慨地說：</p>
<p>「岳飛爲國盡忠，却爲秦檜老奸用莫須有三字的罪名把他害死了……」</p>
<p>於是廣漠的人羣發一聲漠不相關的輕微的嘆息。他們看的是說書人的做作，說書人用全身氣力漲紅了臉學着武松打虎時的一聲大吼，又接連縱了一縱，於是廣漠的人羣笑了，怪聲地在笑了；他們竟說他是小丑。</p>
<p>於是說書人憂鬱了，他悔心了這人羣的不可挽救。生命的憔悴更注與他不少的心底的憂鬱。但是他是無可奈何時，爲了延續自己枯澀的殘年，他又用　續地用他的一塊小小的醒木和一張已變得蒼啞的嗓子在廣漠而昏迷的人羣裏旋轉着。可是最後他終於力竭地倒下了，然而却沒有一個曾經聽過看過他的人們爲他惋惜，因爲他們仍是那麽地昏迷不醒呀！</p>

<h3>一枚銀針箍</h3>
<p>— 晨星譯</p>
<p>——孩童心理的經驗之談——</p>
<p>我九歲的時候，新認識了住在對面的一個女孩，她是來探望她的祖母的，因爲認識了她，我的整個宇宙從此改變了，我很怕羞，看見她金黄色的頭髮，　紅的容顏，便使我發呆，並且那些一半柔和一半莊重的態度，雖然使我不安，但我亦不忍離去，不久我知道她將要回到遠方的家鄕去了，也許就是永遠不回來了。</p>
<p>但是我們之間是絕對的需要一些東西作爲永久友情的連鎖，於是我到商店去找一件完美的禮物，在店裏我找到一隻刻有花紋精美，眩眼的銀針箍，這樣的東西作爲禮物是再好沒有了，不過牠的價錢相當貴，不是我容易買得到的。</p>
<p>但是我必須要得到牠，於是只好戰戰兢兢的跑到父母跟前說：「爸爸，我要五角錢去買一件重要的東西，—但是我不便吿訴你們買的是甚麽東西，不過我認爲這是很正當，而且是很重要的。」</p>
<p>若果他要迫我說出所買的是甚麼東西，那無異宣判我的死刑了。</p>
<p>我父親是敎區裏的牧師，牧師的孩子實際上連五角錢也沒有見過。但是父親聽了我的請求定睛望養我，最後說了：「孩子，你先到書房裏，讓我和你母親商量一下，」不久他便到書房裏來了，付給我五角錢，用手輕輕拍了我的肩，幷沒有說話。</p>
<p>於是我便購了那件動人的體物，放在一隻白盒裘，偷偷的拿了父親的信箋，很費力的綴成幾行字：</p>
<p>「親愛的娜素：</p>
<p>彼此相別，我定必很想念着你，請你再來！愛你的小約翰」</p>
<p>把禮物放在對門門前的地毯上，乘着無人看見的時候按了門鈴便慌張的逃避開來。</p>
<p>第二天早上我起來得極早，在半途欄着郵差，奇怪得很，當眞有一封信是寄給我的，我爬到蘋果樹的頂枝上，秘密的拆開讀這封回信。</p>
<p>「朋友：</p>
<p>謝謝美麗的禮物，我希望明年夏天可以回來。</p>
<p>那時便可以會見你了。誠摯的娜素」</p>
<p>用「朋友」和「誠摯」的字樣來答覆我價昻的禮物，令我有些沮喪，我把信藏在門廊間預備反覆閱讀，但是不久我父親移到別個敎區，從此就沒有再聽見娜素的消息。</p>
<p>事實經過—父母始終未問及我要錢的用途，在緊要關頭時輕輕通過，以我的家規和訓練來說依近代標準當是嚴厲的，但仍尊重個性，當我說到我的需要是重要而且秘密的，他們就接納我的請求，父母信任我，使我信賴他們對於我的一切重要事情都肯玉成，倘若他們拒絕的話，除非是莊嚴的見解—父子間難免有此隔膜，我聽見父母責備孩子們幼稚得很的戀愛事件或其他在成年人看來認爲可笑的事情，我就畏縮，如果你認子女是「人」，有眞切的難題及理解，孩子自會有感應自然會達到父母的期望，</p>
<p>兒童爲成年之始點，驕傲，昏庸，偏僻，暴躁，自私，都應抑制，兒童推心置腹將其情緒及所遭遇困難吿訴父母，父母不應譏笑，更不應輕忽處置，因爲這正是兒童在廣泛的宇宙中尋求援助。</p>
<h3>禁慾有害嗎？</h3>
<p>— 延娟</p>
<p>（一）禁慾的困難</p>
<p>性學家克拉夫特·愛平，曾經這樣說過：</p>
<p>「女子要求戀愛的心理，比男子爲强。對於這種愛的要求的正當的滿足，捨婚姻莫屬。不過，在複雜的近代生活中，結婚成爲困難的問題，因此結婚率逐漸减少，結婚的時期也更晚了。男子方面，在這社會裏性慾問題較易解決，而女子方面，就非抑制不可，因此，容易發生歇斯底里的傾向。年長的處女，容色往往早衰，這就是不能滿足性的衝動所致。這個問題，除結婚外，無法解決。」</p>
<p>愛平的這幾句簡單文句裏，充滿着無窮的思想，我們即使不能够無條件的完全贊同，但抑制性慾，實爲難中之難，無論誰都不免有這種感覺的。</p>
<p>（二）禁慾與神經</p>
<p>到了相當年齡，禁慾生活對於身體有害，這已成爲一種常識。但薛泰哈爾脫曾經說過：</p>
<p>「性的關係，對於諸君的健康，實無必要。假如諸君自出生至老死，絕對沒有性的行爲，那末，諸君的健康決無妨害」</p>
<p>假如像一個偉人一般，抱着鞏固的信念，過絕對的禁慾生活，那末，對於健康，非但沒有害處，反會有好的影響。但如果沒有確實信念，過着一度結婚生活之後，即不得已而禁慾的話，那就要發生上面所說的常識的結果了。</p>
<p>雷溫·法爾特有過下面的統計報吿：</p>
<p>「二十四，五歲的男子，開始絕對禁慾，沒有害處。二十五歲到三十六歲的男子，如果結過婚而禁慾的話，那麼强壯的人，便會呈現神經性症狀，如刺戟性亢進，性慾亢進，工作嫌惡，輕度眩暈等。神經質的人，便會發生憂鬱症，苦悶症等。女子方面，結婚以後，雖較男子忍得住禁慾生活，但神經質的人，也有不少會引起歇斯底里症，神經衰弱症等。」</p>
<p>由於禁慾，對於激烈的性慾衝動加以壓制，使中樞神經疲勞以至於過敏，因而影響到健康。</p>
<p>所以，在性的衝動極淡的時期，或是沒有經騐過激烈衝動的人，禁慾的生活，沒有什麽妨害。如果把劇烈的性慾衝動長期抑制，那一定要使中樞神經系絕端疲勞，一遇到偶發的原因，便要發生神經症的病狀；而且，因爲長時期的精神緊張，常常會變成偏狹的性格。不過，對於體質及神經系强健的人是不致有什麼妨害的。所以，禁慾生活的有害無害，多半要看每個人的生來的神經系的强弱而定。</p>

<h3>怎樣做多福餅？</h3>
<p>— 木每</p>
<p>假如你有見女在校裏唸書的話；最近，大概都領到了配給奶粉吧？但是領到的配給奶粉，質料極粗，要是冲來吃，非但味道難聞，且有沉澱。你的孩子們不大喜歡喝吧？那末怎樣來處置這些奶粉呢？</p>
<p>這兒要說的，就是利用這種奶粉來做一種叫「多福餅」的點心。什麼是「多福餅」呢？假使你記憶力強的話，也許還能記起若干年前在大新公司地下室裏化了一元錢可以買到十只類似圓圈形的那種點心吧？這就叫「多福餅」。本來，這種點心，是以麵粉爲主料，而攙入牛奶。現在則利用奶粉而省去牛奶了。</p>
<p>材料：奶粉十二兩，麵粉四兩。白糖四兩。（你喜吃甜的可以多些）小蘇打一小茶匙。生鷄蛋二只。生油半斤。製</p>
<p>法：除了生油半斤倒入鍋內預備烹熬之外，先把鷄蛋打碎，和入以上諸料中，務使那些奶粉，糖等東西，都十二分調勻爲止。假使蛋汁和糖汁不够調濕那些奶粉，可以和入小半湯匙生油，如仍嫌不够，再可以加一點水，但不能太潮，普通調和到像平常做麵條用的那樣就可以了。調和後，摘成一個一個像桂圓大小似的坯子，再把坯子搓成細長條，約三英吋長，把二端搭上，就成一個圓圈形了。把做成的圓圈，一一放在盤中，防粘搭，先在盤底洒上一層乾麵粉。那時候，你可以引火把油熬熟，待油沸透了，就可把做成的圓圈漸次放入油鍋中汆，看見微黄，就用筷子撈起，這就是自製的多福餅了。趁熱時吃，旣香且脆，而又合乎營養衛生，而况，也化不了多少錢呀！假使你做得多一些，那末放入餅乾箱或玻璃缸中，不使受潮，可以藏置多天。我想，與其在這樣的大熱天，你把錢交給你的孩子們，任他們到外面去買一種不潔凈的冷飲品或閒食來吃而致染到時疫，不如你自己辛苦一下子做些多福餅給他們吃吧。</p>

<h3>黑色蘇州河</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>藍色多瑙河是情致的，黑色蘇州河是恥辱的。多瑙河產生了音樂家，詩人，蘇州河却令人起齷齪之感。</p>
<p>我每天走過蘇州河，我不敢俯視那黑黝黝一道濁流，我仰望天，天高氣爽，藍白分明，但這道渴流所散發出的臭味，却直衝進鼻管，像毒蟒口中所噴射的腥羶氣息。幽靈般躡踪着你，你大上海近四百萬市民。你每天生活在那種氣氛中。</p>
<p>假使以人體作比擬，這是一段潰爛的盲腸，能危及一個人的生命的。</p>
<p>似乎是無可理解的一個神話，虎列拉的魔手竟停止張舞了，有人說，天佑上海人！倘使我們將這偶遇當作習見，那是自殺，上帝也祗是帮助自助者耳。</p>
<p>我不是工務局裏的工程師，不知道蘇州河現在到底有多深，但我相信以前決不會有如此之淺的，但我更相信，長此以往將會比現在更淺，以至於總有一天淤泥（包括垃圾）平齊兩岸，蘇州河變成垃圾路的。</p>
<p>索性塡成路也好，像洋涇浜之築爲中正路，不也利便交通造福市民嗎？</p>
<p>蘇州河是黑色的，雖然它通着黄浦江，通着大海，黑色代表什麼，代表恐怖，死亡，汚穢，卑鄙，也代表恥辱與悲哀。</p>
<p>大上海近四百萬市民是看見的，能熟視無睹嗎？</p>
<h3>分數至上文憑第一　死的教育死的課本</h3>
<p>— 邱堅</p>
<p>日前讀本報社評「敎育制度亟需改革」一文，在一個處在這種制度下的學生的立塲上看來，所起的共鳴尤大。我認爲該文中所指中國新敎育在德育方面的失敗，特別値得强調。舉一個例來說：不准隨地吐痰這一條，差不多每一個學生從小學起至初中常常可以從書本上或是公共塲所見到。但在大學中還是充滿着隨地吐痰的人。至於其他更不用說了：開會時漫無秩序，考試時競相作弊，暴殄公物，不守時刻，總括一句話：現在的學校除了敎學生們怎樣去熟讀，或甚至於背出他們的書本外，對於其他的一切是不遑顧及的。</p>
<p>學生們的唯一目標變成了分數。爲了分數，他們是不惜犧牲的——犧牲了健康開夜車不算，更出賣了自尊心去作弊。事實上愈是「敎管嚴格」的學校，往往是作弊天才的集中地。那些學生們出了學校，難保他們的目標不轉變爲金錢或權勢，於是他們也不顧一切，爲了達到目標而去舞弊，營私。</p>
<p>而重重緊壓着的功課帶給了學生們到底什麽東西呢？肺病失眠不去談，一放學就得趕功課更是天經地義。於是學電機的家中電扇壞了還得出錢請人來修；機械系畢業的連螺絲也沒有做過一只。實用的不說，就說理論的罷，去年背得爛熟的公式今年都忘了，上學期考九十九分的題目這學期拿來一問也答不出了。學生們並不是不覺察這種現象，但他們照樣的開夜車，背書本。敎授們也不是不懂得學生們的困難，但他們還是照樣的把智識硬塡進學生的腦中去。</p>
<p>於是那些連續被塡十幾年的鴨子們總於一批批的被送出校門。他們張開一直爲功課所眩着的眼睛一看——啊喲，這是什麼世界呀？他們發現了書本中沒有提起的種種怪現象，他們遇到了各式各樣的人物。他們或許對環境不满，但多年來爲書本磨損了的身子早已沒有力量了，他們沒有根本的道德觀念，他們缺乏人生觀，更少有人有堅定的意志，於是當這萬惡的社會中的惡勢力向他們侵襲過來的時候，他們被吞沒之。</p>
<p>總之，現在的教育只在拚命的加重學生的頭腦的重量，而不叫他去練練他的身心，更不去根本的敎育他成爲一個健全的，正直的公民。頭重脚輕，豈不倒仆？此常理也！</p>
<h3>健忘之邦</h3>
<p>— 夢白</p>
<p>「中國不會亡，中國不會亡，你看那民族英雄的謝團長！」這支歌，曾響澈全國每個角落，正義而雄壯的歌聲激動了老，幼，男，女的心靈，也催醒了幾千萬有血氣的靑年，拋頭顱灑熱血，効忠國家。現在：他們已經盡了最後責任，長眠地下了，但將軍遺屬，却孤苦無依！</p>
<p>當抗戰勝利將近一年的今天，到處飢荒，盜刼，不景氣現象，但，眼看歌舞昇平的上海，作樂者却遍遍皆是，揮霍無度，逍遙終日！他們可曾記起已死的將士爲了國家爲了民族在沙塲忍痛血枯至死？又可曾想起逝世去了的烈士在敵偽淫威下，因正義不屈而遍嚐酷刑的慘狀？死的是死了，但是我們就僅僅把他們當作歷史陳跡？把他們的光榮史績僅僅付諸國史館，就算了事？文明古國，難道如此健忘？</p>
<p>三言兩語集</p>
<h3>法院罰金　也要調整</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>法院對刑事案件判處罰金的數字，亦隨環境的轉變而大增。譬如賭棍朱順林，除徒刑四年外，並科罰金一萬萬元；聖芳濟學生許佩璜與其父以毀壞他人名譽，各處罰金一萬五千元，如無力完納，以五百元折算一日，易服勞役。記得在戰前大概都是以一元折算一日易服勞役的，則現在與戰前比，恰好漲了五百倍；而一萬萬的罰金，如果亦是依戰前應罰之數加五百倍算的，則朱順林的罰金，在戰前當爲二十萬元。在幣値日貶的今日，將來法院的罰金，是否亦需隨時加以「調整」？</p>
<p>接收工作淸查團辦公處成立了、爲勤求民隱便於淸查起見，將招待各業負責人，聽取意見。其實在過去各報上，各業對於接收工作的意見，早已發表得很多，單就這許多意見作爲根據，着手淸查，已够麻煩，淸查團却不憚其更煩，再要暢聽一下，其勤求民隱的工作精神，實堪敬佩，</p>
<p>行政院賠償調查委員會催報戰時公私財產損失報吿，而吾所認識的許許多多人之中，未聞有一個塡過損失報吿表。過去的苦痛早就遺忘了，過去的損失自亦不想去求償，這才是堂堂大國民的風度？</p>
<p>外國發明一種管樂鬧鐘，據說「有悅耳之音樂，無剌耳之鈴聲」。如果此貨到了上海，吾必不惜巨金先要購置一具，爲的是常常失眠，有悅耳音樂可聽之鐘置於床頭，正好藉此催眠耳。</p>

<p>在歷史上，這一塲驚天動地的孤軍鏖戰，八百壯士以鮮紅的血與肉寫下了光輝燦爛的一頁，永垂不朽！</p>
<p>如今，勝利已近一年，而謝故團長的遺屬依舊徬徨歧途，無所寄托，將軍遺屬，宛如一葉扁舟，飄泊在海洋上，茫茫無邊！這也許是勝利來得太快，原子彈的威力，抹煞了赤裸裸肉體搏鬥的功勞，埋沒了過去無數頭　的犧牲！</p>
<p>現在，謝團長的忠骨已安葬在黄埔江畔，我們的民族英雄巳流盡了他的鮮血，他含笑地靜躺在九泉之下。可是，他想不到光榮的死後，遺屬竟那樣的可憐，無人過問。</p>
<p>中國人是敏感而健忘的，當初大家爭着歌頌謝晋元，如今日本已敗，也就什麼都忘了！</p>
<p>希望政府拿出辦法來，將士遺孤應當有以撫　！</p>
<p>希望上海市民，重溫一下當年的壯烈史實，伸出同情的援手</p>
<p>末了，還必須提出的是：時至今日，我們仍然要堅持兩大要求：在戰時，事仇享樂的必須嚴懲，捨身爲國的將士遺孤，必應有所保障！謝氏遺孤吿貸無門，×××消遙法外，我們至死不服！</p>

<h3>The National Army in Northern Jiangsu Advances on Two Fronts; Dongtai and Xinghua Will Soon Be Recovered; The Main Force of the Communist Army Retreats Towards Hongze Lake</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 29th] The situation in northern Jiangsu today is on the verge of full-scale development. According to an announcement by the military today: (1) The National Army advancing from Taixian towards Xinghua, after crossing Zhoujia Village, immediately split into two advancing forces. One advanced northeastward, and the other advanced directly northward. On the 28th, they recovered Laoge (36 li from Xinghua) and Shenjialun (District 8 of Dongtai) in one fell swoop. The Communist troops along the way were routed at the mere sight of them, and are retreating eastward towards Beimao Mountain and westward towards Fanchuan respectively. The National Army advancing from Laoge entered Shiliting on the 29th and is now setting up positions. The Xinghua county seat is already in sight. The National Army advancing north from Shenlun has crossed Zhuhong Port and is advancing towards Dada. The people, hearing of the arrival of the National Army, brought food and drink, cheering and welcoming them on both banks of the rivers. This area is mostly swampland, and the rice paddies are turning from green to yellow, and the harvest is imminent. However, many of the strong young men in the villages have been forcibly driven away by the Communist Party. (2) A certain unit of the National Army advancing eastward from Haian crossed the two towns of Fuan and Anfeng on the 28th and entered Liangdui on the 29th. The Dongtai county seat is also in sight. (Reporter's Note: Dada is the center point between Dongtai and Xinghua on a straight line, 60 li from Dongtai in the east and 60 li from Xinghua in the west. If the National Army enters Dada, the rear and flanks of the two county seats of Dongtai and Xinghua will be attacked, and they can be recovered together in a matter of days).</p>
<p>[Report from Our Taixian Office, 29th] On the right wing front in northern Jiangsu, the battle has been in a stalemate for days due to rain. The National Army has advanced to the vicinity of Qutang in Haian, but there has been no major progress so far.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 29th] Military news: (1) The main force of the Communist army in areas such as Jiangdu, Liangtai, and Liuhe has gradually retreated towards Hongze Lake since the 29th. (2) There are no main Communist forces in the area from Gaoyou to Huaiyin, only remaining remnants of militia. Furthermore, according to military news from Xuzhou, in the area west of Muyang, the Communist army that invaded from southern Shandong, due to the fierce fighting in Shaojiadian, set up more than 30 heavy artillery pieces on the north bank of Muyang on the 28th and continuously bombarded the south bank. Civilian houses within ten li were destroyed by the artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Jiangyin Office, 29th] In the Zhengdongwei area of Liuxu Port, Jing County, about 800 Communist troops defeated by the National Army landed on the Shengangkou of Chengxi by boat on the night of the 28th. They were discovered and intercepted by the Navy in the Yangtze River and were defeated. Furthermore, the tense situation on the outskirts of Jingyi has been slightly eased due to the arrival of a large number of elite National Army troops crossing the river to reinforce the defense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The Communist army's attacks on the outskirts of Xuzhou are becoming increasingly fierce. The main forces of the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division, the 7th Division of the 4th Division, and parts of the 7th Column of the 3rd Division have all been increased to the area west of Suining to join the offensive. On the morning of the 28th, Yugou and Chaoyangji in the southeast of Xuzhou were captured. The two Communist forces that attacked Shicun Town (southeast of Xuzhou) and Changzhigou (east of Lingbi) were repelled by the National Army after fierce fighting. Taking advantage of the momentum, the National Army passed through Sixian on the 28th and attacked the rear of the Communist army. Yangcun north of Tianchang and Nipeihai and other places in the northwest were attacked by Communist troops newly arrived from Xuyi on the 27th and were all repelled by the National Army. North of Yangzhou Yihui, fighting continues to be fierce. The Communist guerrillas who disturbed the area of Dingyan Town north of Nantong have been completely driven out.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] Reporting on the war, it is heard that Marshall and Stuart have drafted the following six suggestions: (1) The Nationalists and Communists should jointly issue cease-fire orders in various regions; (2) Neutral zones should be demarcated to facilitate the work of battlefield groups; (3) The government should be reorganized as soon as possible before the National Assembly, so that all parties can participate in the government when formulating the constitution; (4) The most important resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference should be implemented; (5) After the ceasefire, the battlefield groups should cooperate closely with the Ministry of Communications; (6) The garrison areas and the number of troops of the Nationalists and Communists should be determined.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] The Howard newspapers commented in editorials: Even if Chairman Chiang invites the Communist Party to participate in the government, it is difficult to guarantee that the Chinese civil war can be ended. The newspaper said: We do not want a red China to appear, nor do we want China to become a vassal of the Soviet Union. If Chairman Chiang allows the Communist Party to participate in the government as encouragement, the Communist Party will make a mountain out of a molehill. The Communist Party once refused to reorganize and unite with the National Army to resist Japan, and internal strife occurred, hindering the anti-Japanese united front. The Soviet Union denied international communism during the war and pretended to want a strong and democratic China to appear, but the Soviet Union still marched forward courageously, advocating international communism. Then the coalition government has lost its purpose and meaning, and is still acting as the fifth column for the Soviet Union in various parts of the world today. Their policy is to dominate others or let others perish.</p>
<h3>Marshall Returns to Nanjing Today; Ambassador Stuart's Illness Gradually Improves; The Chairman Sends Personnel to Express Condolences</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Guling Office, 29th] Marshall is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 30th. If the weather is good, the schedule will not change. Ambassador Stuart will need to confer with the Chairman, so there will be a delay of several days.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Guling Office, 29th] Stuart's temperature dropped to 37 degrees Celsius today, after being unwell and remaining indoors all day. Though tired, he needs rest. Marshall visited at 4pm and spoke for about a quarter of an hour before departing. Chairman Chiang and his wife originally scheduled to host a dinner for Marshall and Stuart at 8pm tonight, but it was temporarily cancelled due to Stuart's illness. It is reported that the Ambassador will be able to meet and confer with the Chairman tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 29th] Ambassador Stuart's temperature has dropped from 39.5 degrees Celsius to 37 degrees Celsius on the morning of the 29th. He slept well last night. If his temperature returns to normal and he rests for a while, he will recover. On the morning of the 29th, Chairman Chiang specially sent Military Aide Pi Zonggan and Secretary Shen Changhuan to express condolences.</p>
<h3>Cai Wenzhi Resigns</h3>
<p>Departs Peiping for America on the 6th of Next Month</p>
<p>[Report from Our Peiping Office, 29th] The resignation of Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government Delegation to the Military Mediation Department, has been approved. He will leave Peiping on the 6th of next month and go to the United States to join General He Yingqin's staff delegation.</p>
<h3>The Ninth Group of the Military Mediation Department Disappears En Route to Xi'an; Qin County in Southern Shanxi Has Been Captured by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 28th] As of 8:00 PM on the 28th, there was still no news of the Ninth Group of the Military Mediation Department arriving in Shaanxi. According to news from related parties, the U.S. military aircraft taken by the Group departed from Laohekou on the 25th, but has not yet arrived. Concerns about the Group's safety are growing. On the 26th, 27th, and 28th, telegrams and telephone calls were made to various parties, but without result. The members of the Group are identified as Government Representative Major General Lu Jishi, Colonel Wu Wenzhi, U.S. Representative Colonel Gazujian, Communist Representative Major General Xue Zizheng, and staff and communication personnel.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] The Ninth Group has still not arrived in Shaanxi. From Laohekou to Xi'an, aside from Communist-disturbed areas, there are no reports of the Group arriving or experiencing any incidents. As of 8:00 PM today, though parties have actively searched, there is still no news.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Hankou Office, 29th] The Communist army under Wang Shusen has infiltrated the mountain cities west of Wudang Mountain. The National Army is blocking them. Furthermore, the Communist army's command system is in great disarray. Li Xiannian himself is now in the area from Manchuan Pass to Banyan, counting the remaining Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] Jiang _, the Government Representative of the Eastern Qin Group of the Military Mediation Department, lodged a serious protest with the Group due to the Communist army's capture of Qin County.</p>
<h3>Enlarged Memorial Week in Kuling; Chairman Chiang Personally Delivers Instructions; Summer Academic Lecture Series in Jiangxi Opens</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Guling Office, 29th] Chairman Chiang personally presided over the Memorial Week of the Summer Camp this morning and gave instructions, encouraging the students to have a consistent attitude in academic research, integrating spirit and practice to achieve the purpose of applying what they have learned, and to accomplish the mission of national construction. After the meeting, the Chairman inspected the Summer Sound Drama School theater troupe performing here and inquired in detail about the lives of the teachers and students of the school. It is reported that a certain drama propaganda team will also go up the mountain to perform.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 29th] The first enlarged Memorial Week in Kuling after the victory and the opening ceremony of the Jiangxi Lushan Summer Academic Lecture Series were held jointly in the auditorium on the second floor of the Chuanxue Academy at 10:00 AM on the 29th. Chairman Chiang personally led the ceremony. Afterward, he delivered a 16-minute speech. With the attitude of an educator, the Chairman expounded on the way to study from the history of academic and cultural development, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and the need to apply what one has learned, especially for the benefit of the country and society.</p>
<h3>On the Assassination Case of Li and Wen; Director Long Issues a Statement; Hopes Newspapers Will Not Publish Incorrect Reports; Tang Zong Ordered to Fly to Kunming Today to Participate in the Investigation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Long Yun, Director of the Military Council, recently issued the following statement: The government attaches great importance to the assassination case of Li and Wen and has repeatedly dispatched senior officials to the scene of the incident to thoroughly investigate. Before the case is clarified, all parties should take an extremely objective attitude and wait for the government's report to clarify the truth. In recent days, a few newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai have made irresponsible reports on the case, involving private individuals and speaking with great certainty, without knowing the source of their information or what basis they have. However, whether it is information provided by outsiders or obtained through self-reporting, once it involves private individuals, they should bear legal responsibility. It is hoped that before the government officially announces the results of the investigation, newspapers will not rashly publish irresponsible reports on this case.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Regarding the assassination case of Li and Wen in Kunming, according to our reporter's investigation, the government is still conducting a strict investigation. Because the inside story is more complicated, it will not be announced rashly until the truth is completely determined. According to reports, Long Yun's second son, Chunzu, was originally the acting commander of the 24th Division. The soldiers of the division were unwilling to be transferred to the Han region for reorganization, so they fled one after another. For this reason, Chunzu came to Nanjing a few days ago to report. He will have a casual dinner with Chief Chen tonight and personally report the situation to Chief Chen. It can be said that this matter has nothing to do with the Kunming Li and Wen case. As for Long Yun's third son, Chunzeng, because of his past indiscrimination in making friends, he did have irregular behavior. His father repeatedly warned him but he did not change. Outside speculation may be from this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 29th] Tang Zong, Director of the Police Department, came to Guling to meet with Chairman Chiang.

<h3>U.S. Military Attacked by Hundreds of Communist Troops En Route from Tianjin to Peiping; Our Military Authorities Send Troops to Rescue</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Peiping Office, 29th] Cai Wenzhi stated that 100 U.S. soldiers were coming to Peiping from Tianjin this afternoon. A conflict with the Communist army occurred near the Anding Station. The government has sent troops to assist.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 29th] Military News: Thirty-one U.S. soldiers, riding in eleven trucks, traveled along the Peiping-Tianjin Highway this afternoon and were suddenly attacked by more than 300 Communist troops of unknown designation near the area of Da and Xiao Sha River north of Hexiwu in Yangcun. There were casualties among the U.S. soldiers. Upon hearing the news, our military authorities dispatched troops to rescue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 29th] Local authorities state that over a hundred U.S. Marines, traveling by truck from Tianjin to Peiping, were attacked by Communist troops in the central area of Peiping and Tianjin at Anding Station at 3:30 PM today, resulting in casualties among the U.S. Marines. Tonight, military officials stated that National Army reinforcements had arrived at the battlefield to assist the U.S. Marines, and that the U.S. Marines had returned fire, resulting in heavier casualties for the U.S. side than for the Communist troops. The Communist troops ambushed the train from strategic points along both sides of the railway. United Press reporters attempted to obtain an official detailed report on the battle from the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters, but were unable to do so because only military officials were given priority to telegraph to Tianjin tonight. According to the National Army, several passenger cars on the Peiping-Tianjin train carrying the U.S. Marines were suddenly fired upon as the train arrived at Anding Station and passengers were boarding and disembarking. It is reported that two U.S. Marines and several passengers were injured. According to government authorities, the U.S. Marines returned fire in self-defense. The number of Communist troops is unknown, but it is believed to be considerable, enough to intrude upon China's main transportation line. Informed sources believe that the fighting will continue tonight, as National Army reinforcements have already arrived at the battlefield. According to informed sources, in addition to an extra train carrying National Army troops from Peiping, several hundred small units have also been dispatched along the railway line from nearby areas. Political circles here believe that this incident is very important, as it is the first large-scale conflict between the Communist army and the U.S. Marines, with both sides opening fire on each other.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Life in Kuling: Frugal and Organized, But the Work is Even More Intense</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu from Our Guling Office</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's daily private life is simple, plain, frugal, and organized. The amount of time spent working is greater than the amount of time spent resting. This is not only well known by the people of China, but also admired by foreigners. After arriving in Lushan, the Chairman's frugal life and hard work did not become easier because he was in a picturesque and poetic environment. On the contrary, the Chairman's life became even simpler, and his work became even more intense.</p>
<p>Every morning, at the latest by seven o'clock, the Chairman must get up. Sometimes he gets up at five or six o'clock. After getting up, he and his wife pray on the balcony on the second floor of the official residence for half an hour. If it rains, they hold the prayer in the study instead, without interruption. The Chairman always uses cold water to wash his face in the morning, and he also wipes his body with cold water before going to bed. Every morning, he also does half an hour of stretching exercises, and then reads on the balcony. He even recites the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean aloud. He doesn't just read them, but recites them aloud for about ten minutes. If you walk along the quiet Hedong Road, you can faintly hear the sound of his recitation in the sound of the spring water hitting the rocks. After finishing the exercises, he goes to the office to read official documents and handle various important matters. Sometimes he also drafts outlines for speeches. Another important task is that he must call important party, government, and military officials every morning to instruct them on the matters that should be handled.</p>
<p>He has breakfast at nine o'clock. Because the Chairman's teeth are not very good, the food is very simple and easy to digest. His breakfast is mostly a cup of milk, two slices of bread fried in butter and then toasted, two scrambled eggs, and some sugar, slightly heated. Sometimes he also eats porridge, noodles, or similar things.</p>
<p>After breakfast, he takes a walk near the official residence and pays close attention to the cleanliness of the surroundings. Whenever he sees an untidy place, he immediately sends someone to clean it up. At the same time, he must inspect the dormitories of the attendants' office every two out of three days to see if they are neat and tidy and whether they are working diligently. Speaking of the attendants, the Chairman must individually summon the attendant officials twice a year. In addition to inquiring in detail about each person's life and family situation, or reprimanding and guiding them in person if they are found to have an improper lifestyle, he also encourages them to study diligently in terms of knowledge. He personally excerpts several books, such as ancient books or the Chairman's own words and deeds in "China's Destiny," and asks them to read them in detail within half a year. When they are summoned in the second half of the year, they must be questioned on the spot about what they have gained after reading them.</p>
<p>He starts seeing guests at 10:30 AM. The people who visit the Chairman are of course distinguished guests from China and abroad. Some are specifically summoned by the Chairman for official business, and some are just visiting. If there is a gathering, he goes out at this time.</p>
<p>He has lunch at 1:00 PM. The lunch is quite simple, usually four dishes and one soup, two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes. He often eats chicken soup or uses chicken soup to cook vegetables. The Chairman and his wife do not like to eat greasy food very much. Their favorite dish is "stir-fried beef with onions," and stir-fried green vegetables are also common. The Chairman not only does not smoke or drink, but he does not even drink tea, only drinking plain water. When entertaining guests, he also uses plain water instead of wine. After the meal, he eats some fruit. There is not much fruit on the mountain, and the Chairman and his wife often eat watermelon.</p>
<p>After the meal, he takes a nap for half an hour, at most an hour, and then continues to work. He sees guests between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM. If there are not many guests, he continues to work. At 4:00 PM, he eats some refreshments, which are similar to breakfast.</p>
<p>Around 6:00 or 7:00 PM, he takes a walk with his wife or invites a few guests, sitting and talking by the creek. He spends the most time with Mrs. Marshall. Then he invites the guests back to the residence and has dinner around 8:00 PM. From 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM, he goes back to the office to work, planning the work for the next day or deciding which personnel should be summoned. He also calls various places to inquire about the progress of the matters entrusted to various officials. He goes to bed at 11:30 PM. Before going to bed, he meditates for 20 minutes, reflecting on the gains and losses of the day. He makes a note of any failures or difficulties so that he can improve his planning and seek solutions.</p>
<p>Apart from walking, picnicking, or playing checkers, the Chairman has no entertainment. There is a radio in the official residence. When he is free, the Chairman listens to Peking opera records. The Chairman is very interested in Peking opera.</p>
<p>The Chairman's clothes are also exceptionally simple and plain. The materials are very ordinary. When meeting with guests, he wears a blue robe and black mandarin jacket when meeting with civil officials, and a Zhongshan suit or military uniform when meeting with military officials. He mostly wears a Zhongshan suit when going for a walk, but sometimes he also wears a military uniform and a long robe and mandarin jacket. On Sundays, he goes to the small church across the street to worship.</p>
<p>The Chairman's wisdom, ability, and memory are truly unmatched. Every time he goes to a place, he has already studied the local map. He is not only familiar with the terrain, but also very clear about the geology. Once, the Chairman and his wife took their entourage to Lulin to play, and another time they went to Doctor's Nest to tour. When they came back, they should have gone back the same way, but the Chairman said that another road could be taken, and it was closer. But everyone did not know it, so they tried it. As a result, they did get home. This happened several times. Another time, the Chairman and his wife and Mrs. Marshall were out for a stroll. They walked along a tree-lined road. The soil was like cement, soft and loose, and felt like cotton when stepped on. The Chairman told Mrs. Marshall that this kind of soil was very different from other soils, and that it was only found in Kuling. No one else knew about it. After hearing this, they could not help but admire him in their hearts.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more thing that must be mentioned, and that is the Chairman's love for the people. Whenever the Chairman is walking in the forest or on the street, the people stand at attention from a distance to salute. The Chairman always tells them not to be formal and to pass by as they please. When he sees that the people's clothes are untidy, he tells them to button them up. If their hands and feet are dirty, he tells them to wash them clean. In addition, whenever the Chairman sees a minor soldier, he always orders the entourage to take him back to the official residence to inquire about his number and his unit. He immediately summons the chief officer of the unit to tell him not to let minor children be soldiers and orders him to be reassigned elsewhere.</p>
<p>Lushan is not a big place, and the Chairman often goes out for walks or attends gatherings, giving the people on the mountain many opportunities to see the Chairman. They feel that the Chairman is kind and approachable, like seeing their own father. No wonder that when they shout "Long live Chairman Chiang," the loud and enthusiastic sound moves and excites everyone. (Sent from Lushan on July 27)</p>
<h3>The Franco-Vietnamese Conflict Intensifies; The Plight of Overseas Chinese in Northern Vietnam; France Violates Agreements and Arbitrarily Increases the Burden on Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 28th] Over ten thousand overseas Chinese in Northern Vietnam are today trapped in an extremely complex political vortex. Although the armed conflict between France and Vietnam has subsided, the political struggle is intensifying. Every struggle between the two sides directly or indirectly affects the overseas Chinese, as the commercial sector in Northern Vietnam is currently in the hands of overseas Chinese. The Franco-Vietnamese Agreement of March 6 stipulated that Vietnam has fiscal autonomy. However, the banknotes currently circulating in Vietnam are issued by the French-operated Banque de l'Indochine. The bank, citing factual needs and with the approval of the French government, increased the issuance of Vietnamese currency by 2.2 billion yuan after March 6. The Vietnamese government believes that this increase in banknotes violates the Franco-Vietnamese Agreement and undermines Vietnam's fiscal autonomy, and therefore prohibits its circulation. However, the Vietnamese government has not effectively prevented the French commercial bank from issuing new banknotes, but only passively suppresses the use of the banknotes. As overseas Chinese are more involved in commercial activities, they hold a significant amount of banknotes. Therefore, the Vietnamese authorities often search overseas Chinese shops and residences and arbitrarily confiscate the banknotes owned by overseas Chinese. The number of overseas Chinese whose property has been damaged as a result is very large. The French Commissioner's Office in Northern Vietnam announced that Chinese merchants do not need to declare and pay taxes when their goods enter and exit various ports. Simultaneously, the Vietnamese Ministry of Finance also announced a tax regulation, stipulating that Chinese merchants should pay taxes to the Vietnamese government when their goods enter and exit various parts of Vietnam. The Vietnamese government considers the French notification to Chinese merchants that they do not need to pay taxes as a violation of the Franco-Vietnamese Agreement. After the Vietnamese government announced the tax regulations, it immediately began to set up customs inspection stations in Haiphong and other places to levy taxes, and set up inspection stations on major highway transportation routes. No overseas Chinese goods can pass without being heavily taxed. Although the goods of overseas Chinese that have been taxed by the Vietnamese government do not need to be taxed when they pass through areas controlled by the French, the French believe that having paid taxes to the Vietnamese side is a violation of the Sino-French Agreement and have filed several protests with our consulate in Hanoi and Haiphong. The French side also informed our consulate that the French side is fully responsible for protecting all the lives and property of overseas Chinese in accordance with the Sino-French Agreement. However, in reality, the footprints of overseas Chinese are all over Vietnam, and the French only reach the larger cities. According to the Sino-French Agreement, overseas Chinese should be consistent with the French side, but in reality, it is impossible. Serving both Qin and Chu makes the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Northern Vietnam deeply feel their difficult situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 28th] Nine hundred overseas Chinese who returned to China from Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chuan arrived in Haiphong on the afternoon of the 27th. These overseas Chinese were originally part of the French army's overseas forces. The Vietnamese authorities will reorganize them and have them join the Vietnamese army to continue their service.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 29th] Overseas Chinese in Heyang on the Yunnan-Vietnam border, due to their location in the conflict zone between the two Vietnamese parties, are in a difficult situation. In addition to sending representatives to Hanoi to appeal to all parties for relief, a week ago they also sent representatives Huang Yujin and Nong Yongfu to Changlipo on the border to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities. Before the trip, they had obtained the consent of the Vietnamese side and were issued passes. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd, while returning to Heyang, they were suddenly ambushed by several armed Vietnamese two kilometers near the Vietnamese military camp in Qingshuihe. Huang Yujin was shot twice and his thigh bone was fractured, and Nong Yongfu was kidnapped and went missing. After this news reached here, the overseas Chinese were shocked. Because the official representatives of the overseas Chinese were illegally ambushed and went missing by armed Vietnamese, they have requested our consulate in Hanoi to negotiate with both the French and Vietnamese sides.</p>
<h3>Our Ships Sailing in the Nanyang Region; Goods Repeatedly Confiscated by the Dutch; Indonesian Government Increases Import and Export Taxes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 28th] According to the Tian Sheng Daily, Chinese ship merchants sailing in the Dutch harbors and between Java and Singapore are facing a very difficult period, because the Dutch authorities continue to confiscate their goods at sea, and the Indonesian government has increased import and export taxes to an alarming extent. The newspaper stated that in the first half of July alone, about 9,000 bags of white sugar loaded on two Chinese cargo ships were arbitrarily confiscated as enemy property by Dutch warships before they arrived in Cirebon. The Chinese cargo owners had already paid a high export tax of 200% to the Indonesian authorities for this batch of white sugar. It is estimated that each bag of this white sugar would be worth about 1,000 Dutch guilders after arriving in Cirebon. Imported goods from Singapore and other places, such as cigarettes and bicycles, are forcibly purchased by the Indonesian navy at low prices or directly confiscated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th] The Dutch ship Cibadak departed from here last night for various ports in China, carrying 1,600 Chinese passengers.</p>

He also said that some lawless people had deliberately destroyed the embankments of various rivers, attempting to cause a major disaster, but fortunately it was discovered early and disaster was avoided.</p>
<p>[Local News] The Executive Yuan announced: The water level in the rivers north of Tianjin in Hebei Province has suddenly risen in recent days, and the situation is critical and very worrying.

Judging from the actions of the perpetrators in the entire case, it is clear that they belonged to an organized group that repeatedly committed robbery cases on Dongjiadu, Xieqiao, Dangtu, and Nanjing-Wuhu routes in Shanghai, and had premeditated robberies on the Nanjing-Shanghai, Dan-Li and other highways. The main offenders include Chen Tianru (real name Chen Jun), Huang Xinhai, Zhang Yongqing, Dai Changrong, Wang Tiancai, and others, who make a living by robbery.

<p>Increasing Rice Production in Western Zhejiang; Professor Jin Da Plans</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou Communication] Professor Ying Kanggeng of the Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University, taking advantage of the summer vacation and at the invitation of Zhang Rongchu of Linghu, led more than ten students to Tanglou, Linghu, and other places in western Zhejiang to investigate agriculture for two months. In addition to the publication of various special research reports, Ying was particularly interested in the great hope for increasing rice production in western Zhejiang. He specifically drafted the "Plan for Increasing Rice Production in Western Zhejiang" for reference. It is heard that the plan was drafted with extremely accurate and conservative figures, and focuses on improving irrigation and drainage tools and increasing the application of fertilizers. It is estimated that each municipal mu (about 0.067 hectares) of paddy field will require a one-time permanent investment of 20,000 yuan in water conservancy tools, and an annual investment of 15,000 yuan in fertilizers, and each municipal mu of paddy field can increase production by 5 to 15 municipal dou (1 dou is about 10 liters), or the value of 25,000 to 75,000 yuan, and the increased production of straw and winter crops is not included in the calculation. It is believed that the lack of water conservancy tools and fertilizers in the farmland of western Zhejiang has a significant impact on production. It is heard that after the plan is drafted, it will be distributed to all relevant sectors to call attention.</p>

<h3>The Great Obstacle to China's Peace</h3>
<p>Peace, peace, in China today, is truly in accordance with the will of Heaven and the response of the people!</p>
<p>The Chinese people need peace; the Chinese government also needs peace. After eight years of arduous war, the Chinese people long to return home, long to go home, long to restore normal life, and naturally sincerely seek peace. Yuan Xiluo, an elder of Jiangsu, is willing to fast and bitterly persuade, which is a representative of the urgent call for peace from the Chinese people. President Chiang has always advocated a "political solution" and proposed to temporarily divide the troops' garrison areas, waiting for reorganization in accordance with Marshal Ma's plan, as a concrete way to stop military conflicts. President Song even made it clear that "if there is no peace in the country, there will be no way to solve the financial and economic problems." This is especially the most frank expression of the government's need for peace.</p>
<p>Not only do the Chinese people and government need peace, but many of our allies also need China's peace. President Truman's statement on China policy last winter, the dispatch of Special Envoy Marshall to China, the new appointment of Ambassador Stuart, and the recent visits of Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart to Beijing and Guling, and their mediation despite their illness, are all facts that the United States desires peace in China. This policy of the United States to promote the peaceful unification of China is not only considered correct by the United States. According to the communique of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference last December, Britain and the Soviet Union also agreed that "a unified and democratic China under the National Government is needed, that broad participation of all democratic elements in the National Government is needed, and that military conflicts need to be stopped immediately." It can be seen that all allies also eagerly hope that China can truly and quickly achieve peace.</p>
<p>The Chinese people and government, as well as China's allies, especially the United States, are so eager for peace, but peace has not yet been achieved, as if it can be hoped for but not attained. Where is the crux of the matter?</p>
<p>The Communist command platform in Yan'an, and the Communist spokespersons in various places, and even the friends who cheer for the Communists, have recently been clamoring that the reactionary elements in China and the United States are using the stationing of the US military in China and the US aid to the National Government to create a civil war in China. According to their distorted propaganda, it seems that as long as the US military withdraws from China and the US stops aiding China, China can achieve peace; if so, then the US's enthusiastic aid to China from the war period to the post-war surrender would not be as the saying goes, "wanting to be good turns into evil," and these speakers who speak nonsense fully show their "ungrateful" nature. Any Chinese person with a conscience will certainly not have this view.</p>
<p>We believe that the great obstacle to China's peace is that the Chinese Communist Party only knows how to follow the lead of foreigners, and has no national concept and national consciousness at all. Because of this, the CCP is equal to a soulless body, it cannot make its own decisions! The CCP is not like the British Communist Party and the American Communist Party. First, it has no ideas of its own, and second, it only knows how to expand its army by taking advantage of opportunities, and does not know that at a certain stage, it has become too big to fall. The peace negotiations between the government and the CCP, from the invitation of Mr. Mao Zedong to Chongqing in August last year, have been delayed for nearly a year, so they have always been hot and cold, intermittent, and the root cause lies in this. To put it bluntly: To see the future of China's peace, it seems that we should not only look at Yan'an, but also look further at Moscow. If we only measure the climate of peace between Nanjing and Guling, I am afraid it will be somewhat blurred. Former US Undersecretary of State Welles said in a broadcast on the 28th: "Moscow, in view of the increasingly tense relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, has instructed the CCP leaders to reject fair and constructive solutions in the KMT-CPC negotiations." Mr. Welles' words are probably said after he saw a little more clearly.</p>
<p>However, we cannot blame Moscow, but we should explore two points: (1) Why do people willing to accept instructions from Moscow emerge among "Chinese"? (2) Why can the CCP, which accepts orders from Moscow, actually grow on Chinese soil? These two points are really the key to why China cannot achieve peace today.</p>
<p>Point (1) is nothing new. Every country has such people, the only difference is the amount. Since "Chinese" had traitors like Wang Jingwei and Pu Yi who were willing to obey the Japanese invaders in the past, then how can we guarantee that no one will obey Moscow? Therefore, this point alone is not enough to cause concern for China's peace.</p>
<p>Regarding point (2), we have to blame the government! We fought the war of resistance, and everyone knew that it was to fight for the country's independence and autonomy, so why could the CCP, which obeys Moscow, grow in China? During the eight-year war of resistance, the CCP made distorted propaganda to the outside world, but the government remained indifferent and did nothing, first. The CCP is absolutely flexible and active in fighting and negotiating, while the government is passive everywhere and perfunctory in everything, second. The CCP actually exploits the people, but verbally boasts of implementing the Three People's Principles, and even expands the propaganda of its land distribution policy; but the government leaves the legacy of "those who cultivate have their own land" unattended, and puts the soil law, factory law, land policy, agricultural and industrial policies, and social policies passed by the central government on the shelf, as if these laws and policies are just decorations, third. Finally, at the beginning of the victory, the government neglected the responsibility of giving the people a peaceful and prosperous life, but only saw the Communist Party with guns, thinking that as long as the Communist Party was fed with the method of "dividing political power," the world could be peaceful. As a result, the CCP saw the government's psychological weakness, launched an uprising, attacked cities, and seized land, and the government initially just stood by and suffered passively, begging for peace, not only unable to save the people from dire straits militarily, but also unable to give the people hope politically, fourth. Because of these four reasons, the CCP is content with the usability of past techniques, and repeatedly uses its usual technique of "talking and fighting," and China's peace is still hoped for but not attainable. In short, we must look at the issue of China's peace in conjunction with the issue of international peace. Not only because world peace is indivisible, but really because the CCP, which obstructs China's peace, is a link in the world communist party. Mr. Welles said it well: As relations between the United States and the Soviet Union become increasingly tense, the CCP rejects fair and constructive peace plans. Not only that, but the CCP has further launched anti-American propaganda in China to echo Moscow's broadcasts and newspaper arguments. Dulles' "Soviet Foreign Policy" in Life Magazine says that the Soviet Union divides the world into three zones: Tannu Uriankhai and Lushun are in her "internal zone;" Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the nine northeastern provinces are in her "intermediate zone;" and the whole of China is one of her countries in the worldwide "peripheral zone." The CCP's actions within China probably meet the needs of this "peripheral zone." We must first recognize this inside story, and then we can prescribe the right medicine for China's peace and remove this factor that hinders peace.</p>
<h3>French President Bidault Elected Chairman: Opening Address of the European Peace Conference: Hope to Eliminate the Scourge of War Forever: Two Committees Established to Discuss Procedural Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Paris, 29th - Live Broadcast: The long-publicized peace conference finally opened two hours ago (midnight in Shanghai). Attlee, Byrnes, Molotov, and Vyshinsky arrived one after another. French President Bidault first announced the opening of the conference, followed by a ten-minute speech, which was met with thunderous applause. Mr. Bidault delivered the speech in French; the original text is being translated. The main points are two: (1) Hoping that peace can bring the tranquility that this corner of Europe needs most. (2) To forever prevent the scourge of war. After the speech, the conference unanimously elected Bidault as the chairman of the peace conference, and subsequently appointed two committees to discuss procedural and other issues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th, United Press] At 4 p.m. today (midnight in Shanghai), representatives from 21 countries, seated on red velvet chairs in the Luxembourg Palace, listened quietly to the speech of French Prime Minister Bidault, representing the French government, welcoming the guests from various countries. This Paris Peace Conference will not actually stipulate a peace treaty, but will only allow the small countries that have contributed to the Allied victory to state their views on the peace treaty and how peace can be achieved. Then, the Four Powers will weigh these suggestions before drafting the final peace treaty. Byrnes said he hoped that the representatives of the 21 countries could sign this peace treaty during their time in Paris, and that the defeated countries could also state their opinions. It is generally believed that the conference has great power and will be used to formulate a treaty with Italy, as this treaty includes the issues of Italian African colonies and Trieste. The Latin American delegation is openly seeking lenient treatment for Italy, but the Soviet Union and its satellite states are quite demanding of Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] After the opening of the 21-nation peace conference, the procedural rules proposed by the Four Powers will be discussed. The Four Powers, who drafted the treaty, and the other 17 countries are expected to have their first conflict here. The main point of the procedure is to divide into committees to discuss each of the five peace treaties. Whether in the plenary session or in the committee discussions, a two-thirds majority voting system will be adopted. In principle, this procedure is only a suggestion that the 21 countries can accept, modify, or reject. If accepted, the Four Powers only need one-third of the supporters to prevent any country from proposing amendments to the draft treaty. It is generally expected that some Allied countries that have not participated in the drafting of the treaty will inevitably criticize the work of the Four Powers. The most vocal among them is expected to be Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. As for the five former enemy countries, they have also been invited to state their opinions. It is thought that Italy and others will certainly use this opportunity to express their opposition to the draft. The Four Powers spent nearly a year negotiating the draft treaty, and will naturally strongly refute the dissenting opinions of other countries.</p>
<h3>Draft Peace Treaty to be Released Today: Four Nations Have Reached Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 29th - Broadcast: According to well-informed sources, the conference of foreign ministers' representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France has decided to publish tomorrow the contents of the peace treaties drafted by the foreign ministers' conference with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. They will be released simultaneously in London, Washington, and Moscow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] British Prime Minister Attlee and Byrnes held talks this afternoon for a long time, but the topics of discussion were not announced. However, delegation sources believe that it involved the Palestinian issue. It is also reported that the issue of releasing the draft treaty was also raised.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Treaty with Italy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] The draft peace treaty with Italy, drafted by the four foreign ministers, will be submitted for discussion at the peace conference that opens today. The key points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Italian border should be in the state of January 1, 1938, except for special cessions. (2) The French-Italian border will be slightly modified. Italy should cede several kilometers in the Saint-Pénat Pass, the Cime de Sines, the Mont Thabor area, the Chaberton area, Tende-La Brigue, and La Roya. (3) The border between Italy and Yugoslavia should be delineated according to the border line proposed by France. The entire area east of the line should be transferred to Yugoslavia. The Free Territory of Trieste will be established within the "French Line". (4) Italy should conclude a technical agreement with Austria to ensure the free passage of northern and southern Tyrol. (5) Italy should cede all sovereignty over the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, and the area will remain a demilitarized zone. (6) Italy recognizes and respects the sovereignty and independence of Albania, as well as Abyssinia. (7) Various permanent fortifications on the Italian border, whose firepower can reach French territory or territorial waters, should be removed. Various military facilities along the Yugoslav border should also be destroyed. (8) Italy should pay reparations of $100 million to the United States within seven years, and reparations to other countries will be determined separately. (9) Within 18 months after the implementation of the peace treaty, Italy should give special treatment to member states of the United Nations until Italy signs trade agreements with the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Abolition of Special Privileges in China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, 29th] The key points of the part concerning China in the draft treaty with Italy to be discussed at the 21-nation peace conference are as follows: (1) Italy abandons all interests and privileges in the final protocol signed in Beijing in September 1901 (i.e., the Boxer Protocol), and all its appendices and supplementary documents. Italy agrees that the above-mentioned protocol and its attachments should be annulled. (2) Italy abandons any demands under the indemnity. (3) Italy agrees to cancel the lease right of the Italian concession in Tianjin and hand over any documents belonging to the concession archives preserved by the Italian side to the Chinese government. (4) Italy abandons its rights to the Shanghai and Xiamen International Settlements and agrees that the above-mentioned settlements should be returned to the Chinese government for governance.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Delivers a Speech: Advocates for an Alliance Between Britain and France: Opposes German Unification and Centralization</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bar-le-Duc, France, 28th] General de Gaulle delivered a speech here, stating that Europe, based on the friendship between Britain and the United States, should act as a balance between the two major blocs of the United States and the Soviet Union, impartially. If the people of Britain and France can establish a basic agreement, dedicated to peace, with the same joint efforts as in wartime, it will be of great benefit to the world. Creating peace and strengthening organizations to protect peace is very temporary and fleeting, and we should make timely efforts. However, at this moment, there are still some key points, especially the German issue, that separate Britain and France and prevent them from moving towards unity. French peace depends on the solution of Germany's destiny. Regardless of the difficulties Germany encounters, Germany is still Germany. In other words, it is a great nation in the heart of Europe. Although it has fallen into a deep abyss, it still does not forget the glorious achievements of the past. If it can get a chance to revive, it will engage in war again. For this reason, France opposes anything that would make Germany a unified and centralized country again. The solution to the German problem proposed by France is the most practical. The German states, such as Prussia, Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, Hesse-Palatinate, and the Rhineland, can all retain their traditional names and implement autonomy, but the armaments factories in the Ruhr area should be placed under international control, the Saar area should be returned to France, and some places on the western border of Germany should be ceded to Poland. As for the security of Germany's neighbors, it should also depend on the Oder River and the Rhine River. In addition, the atomic energy control plan proposed by the US government seems very reasonable to France.</p>
<h3>France Seeks Security: Bidault Clarifies Position</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saint-Étienne, France, 28th] On the eve of the opening of the European Peace Conference, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a speech here, stating that if France is in a dangerous state, then no country in the world will be safe. Therefore, France insists on the guarantees necessary for its security. The fate of the French people is at stake, and the relationship is too great. Therefore, it is important to find a way to eliminate the precarious situation that French security is currently facing.</p>

<h3>Ireland Plans to Apply: To Join the United Nations: Decides to Abandon Neutrality</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] After the Irish Parliament unanimously passed a resolution last week to join the United Nations, it has now decided to abandon its neutrality policy. This is the first neutral country in Europe during World War II willing to accept the responsibilities and obligations of the United Nations and become one of its members. Prime Minister de Valera told Parliament in a clear tone that after Ireland becomes a member of the United Nations, it should fulfill its duties. If it wants to evade its obligations, it will be extremely unfavorable. It should uphold the determination to abide by the law and jointly participate in its execution. Ireland consulted Britain three weeks ago on Ireland's accession to the United Nations. Its response was very friendly and guaranteed to assist Ireland in submitting its application.</p>

<h3>Gandhi's Theory of Independence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bombay, 29th] Gandhi today published his concept of Indian independence in the "Harijan Report," stating that freedom should be universal throughout the country, including the Indian princely states and French and Portuguese territories. He hopes that every village will be a republic, self-sufficient and autonomous, even able to defend itself against the world. Every religion has complete and equal status. Machines that replace labor and concentrate power in the hands of a few will not be tolerated. He also said that he is an opponent of violent means, so he will not be a part of seizing power through general strikes. But if unfortunately there is a break, he may have other ways.</p>
<h3>Our Chairman's Leniency Towards Japan: Japanese Congressman Says Gratitude Should Be Conveyed to Our Country</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Liberal Party Congressman Kitagishi questioned the government at the general headquarters of the House Budget Committee today, saying that Japan carried out a war of aggression against China, and China fought hard to resist and finally won. The current situation of the Japanese nation is certainly sad, but China should still be congratulated for its victory. After China's victory, it was quite sympathetic to the Japanese people, especially Chairman Chiang's statement on taking a lenient attitude towards the Japanese people and Japanese expatriates in China. However, Japan currently has no international status and is in a situation where it cannot repay China's kindness. In the future, it may be possible to use cultural exchange methods. At present, can we convey the gratitude of the Japanese people to Chairman Chiang to China? Yoshida replied: Chairman Chiang's post-war statement on Japan is naturally appreciated by the Japanese government and the public, and I am also very moved. Recently, I have heard that Japanese returning from China have praised the Chinese government's handling as generous, and facts prove that the government should express its gratitude. However, Japan currently has no diplomatic relations with foreign countries and has no diplomatic powers, so it cannot express its gratitude. I hope that it can find a way to express its gratitude to China as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Former Professor of Jinling University Recounts in International Court: A Glimpse of the Bestial Acts of the Japanese Army in Nanjing: Another Witness Describes the Tragic Situation He Experienced Personally</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Special Dispatch] Bedes, a former history professor at Jinling University, today commented on the various acts of rape, massacre, arson, and looting committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing in the International Court, and the courtroom was filled with an atmosphere of terror and astonishment. Bedes was previously a member of the International Security Zone Committee. He estimated that the Japanese army committed about 20,000 cases of rape in Nanjing, and at least 12,000 civilians were massacred. This number does not include people who were identified as former military personnel. During Bedes's statement, he hesitated because the details contained unspeakable terror and misery. The court president Webb asked the witness not to be reluctant to narrate because what he intended to mention was too terrifying. Bedes then said: The Japanese army raped women, regardless of day or night, sometimes even on the street. One woman was gang-raped by 17 Japanese soldiers in a public cemetery. A girl as young as nine years old and the girl's 76-year-old grandmother were raped in Nanjing city. Japanese soldiers in teams of 15 to 20 often entered the security zone day and night to search for women, and even the wives of university professors could not escape the ravages of Japanese soldiers and lose their virginity. Bedes recalled the situation of the Nanjing Massacre and said: The most treacherous and vicious thing was undoubtedly the Japanese army's trick to lure Chinese people to their deaths. At that time, Matsui Iwane, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, issued a notice saying that Japan treated Chinese soldiers with goodwill. The Japanese soldiers told the former Chinese soldiers that if they joined the labor corps, everything could be forgotten. However, when some former Chinese soldiers admitted their past identities, they were lined up by the Japanese soldiers and swept away with machine guns. In addition, 200 Chinese civilians were shot by the Japanese army on the night they left the Jinling University campus. Bedes described the looting of the Japanese army as an organized and consistent act, and testified that the Japanese soldiers, under the command of officers, used trucks to transport away the loot, taking away any items anytime, anywhere. The Japanese army even often tore down and destroyed the American flag and refused to respect the property of the Americans, who were still neutral at the time, and even the private property of German nationals was occupied by the Japanese soldiers. Bedes also mentioned the arson atrocities of the Japanese soldiers, saying that after the fall of Nanjing, for a long time, there was constant arson. Earlier, Xu Jun, the Shanghai manager of the Far East Development Company, testified that in May 1942, when he passed the Yunnan-Burma Road, he witnessed 703 corpses of Chinese people killed by Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers looted the belongings of these civilians, then made them sit in a circle (Xu Jun was also in it) and swept them away with machine guns. When the machine gun fired, Xu Jun immediately bent forward. The people on both sides of him were killed, and their bodies fell on him. The next day, he saw about 1,000 corpses of civilians, who were either shot or stabbed to death with bayonets.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of American Missionaries Return to the Far East</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 28th] Four hundred Christian missionaries are scheduled to take the ship Lincks from San Francisco to work in China and the Philippines on August 28. According to Elson, secretary of the Foreign Missions Board of the North American Church, the number of missionaries going abroad is the largest this time. They will land in batches in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila. As soon as traffic is smooth and supplies are convenient, no fewer than 8,000 members of Christian congregations will return to the Far East and the Pacific Islands to preach, and the 400 people who are departing this time are their pioneers. American missionaries and their families have been waiting for ships on the West Coast for several weeks. In order to solve the transportation difficulties, the church authorities chartered two ships, and the Lincks is the first of these "church ships."</p>
<h3>A Lesson Learned from the Pearl Harbor Incident: The U.S. Decides to Deploy a Spy Network, with Lee Hee and Vandenberg Taking Charge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The United States has resolved to deploy the most comprehensive spy network abroad. U.S. Army and Navy authorities, learning from the Pearl Harbor attack, have issued a warning, stating that the United States cannot be a victim of such attacks again. If the enemy attacks again, it will undoubtedly use a large number of devastating atomic bombs. The United States will not be able to concentrate its forces and launch a counterattack in one or two years, as it did in the last war. Only by foreseeing the crisis can the United States avoid the catastrophe. President Truman, in response to these warnings, has ordered the establishment of a</p>
<p>National Intelligence Agency</p>
<p>Its mission is to plan, develop, and coordinate U.S. intelligence activities abroad. It will be headed by Secretary of State, the Army and Navy Departments, and President Truman’s personal representative, General Lee Hee. The President has also established the Central Intelligence Group as the executive arm of this agency, with Lieutenant General Vandenberg as its director. The executive arm will assist the National Intelligence Agency in formulating plans and policies and will organize and disseminate various foreign intelligence collected by federal departments to relevant U.S. government agencies for reference.</p>
<p>Central Intelligence Group</p>
<p>has now been established, but it will not actually participate in the collection of foreign intelligence. This task will be left to representatives of the State Department stationed abroad, Army and Navy intelligence personnel, and other appropriate agencies. However, this plan has various limitations, preventing the existing agencies from competing with the high level of effectiveness of British secret operations. One of the restrictions is the traditional American opposition to conducting espionage in friendly foreign countries or spying on other countries' private affairs. The Director of the State Department's Office of Intelligence and Research, Loon Chiu, frankly stated, "If the United States wants to have a spy network, it cannot be created within the State Department. We</p>
<p>do not engage in clandestine activities</p>
<p>or spy around. Ambassadors and their staff cannot perform this dirty task. Their actions must befit their diplomatic status." The Army and Navy intelligence authorities share the same view. Most Army and Navy representatives stationed abroad are Army and Navy attachés stationed in dozens of embassies and legations. If their actions offend the government of the host country, they will be recalled. The Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence, Lunt, stated, "U.S. naval attachés must obtain intelligence through legitimate means." The Army Department's intelligence authorities said the same.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Strategic Services</p>
<p>made great contributions during the war. Its personnel are now assisting in the organization of peacetime intelligence agencies. The Office of Strategic Services was disbanded last year, and its research division was taken over by the State Department, consisting of 500 people, including historians, geographers, anthropologists, and other experts. The intelligence division of the Office of Strategic Services was transferred to the Army Department. The State Department formed a research division, led by Loon Chiu, to analyze intelligence materials. The experts will conduct extensive and organized research, covering many geographical areas, such as the Ruhr area, the Turkish Straits, and the situation in Italy. As for the Director of the Central Intelligence Group, Vandenberg, he is an optimist. He stated, "We have great plans and rich ideals, but we are currently in the organizational stage. Please give us time and support, and we will surely succeed."</p>

<h3>One of the Four Grain Officials in the Grain Loan Embezzlement Case, Yang Xizhi, Returns to China and Arrives in Shanghai. After a Two- or Three-Day Stay, He Has Gone to Beijing to Report Everything. Rumor Has It That He Went to the Garrison Headquarters to Surrender</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The grain loan embezzlement case, since it was reported by the Supervisory Yuan, has been investigated by military and judicial authorities for months, but there is still no clear result. In recent weeks, the progress of the case has been particularly slow, which has caused great concern among the public. Therefore, the reporter yesterday again visited Director Tseng of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters. According to him, the case has not actually been shelved in recent months, but because the主管 authorities repeatedly ordered subordinates not to disclose information to the outside world without authorization, it is inconvenient to report the extent to which the investigation has progressed. However, it can be said with certainty that the judgment of the case will be based entirely on legal principles, and sufficient evidence will be provided regardless of guilt or innocence. When the reporter asked whether the judgment of the case must be made after answering the relevant points requested by Minister Hsu, Tseng smiled and talked about other matters, only saying that the case should be announced around the sixth or seventh of next month. The reporter learned that one of the four grain officials reported, Yang Xizhi, the former Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Grain Administration, returned to China from the United States a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai. After staying in Shanghai for two or three days, he went to Beijing the day before yesterday to report to the Ministry of Food on his trip to the United States to attend the UN Food Conference and order foreign rice. As for the rumor that "Yang Xizhi surrendered to the Garrison Headquarters after returning to China," I specifically asked Tseng about this. Tseng said that he had not heard of this. It was also learned that the account books of the grain loan merchants have been checked by accountants, but the report has not yet been sent to the Military Law Department.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's Order to Suspend Shipments of Relief Supplies to China Will Be Lifted, as UNRRA Expresses Sympathy After Chiang's Explanation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] UNRRA's order to suspend shipments of relief supplies to China will definitely be lifted within days. A spokesman for CNRRA stated that as of yesterday, the Shanghai office had not yet received a formal notice from UNRRA to lift the order. However, CNRRA recently received a report from its Washington branch that after the UNRRA authorities received the explanation issued by Chiang Ting-fu in Shanghai a few days ago, they expressed considerable sympathy for the difficulties faced by CNRRA's work. Therefore, there should be no problem in principle with lifting the previous order.</p>
<h3>The Minzhong Steamer Runs Aground</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Company's Minzhong steamer, which recently underwent repairs, was on its maiden voyage to Yichang. A few days ago, it sailed through Hankou. Yesterday, the steamer sent a telegram reporting that it had run aground 40 miles downstream from Yichang. It is currently telegraphing Yichang to send a steamer for assistance and to unload the cargo to reduce the weight and make the ship float.</p>
<h3>Numerous Passengers and Cargo on the Northern Shipping Route, but No Ships to Load. The Linsen and Hanyang Steamer Will Sail to Shantou and Qingdao Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] According to news from customs brokers, commercial transportation on the Nanyang route has been relatively smooth for several weeks. The China Merchants Bureau's Linsen steamer will depart today for Shantou and Wan Fuzhou. The Haiwan steamer is scheduled to sail directly to Guangzhou on August 1. The Dengjian steamer is scheduled to sail to Xiamen on the same day and Wan Fuzhou on the return trip. Although the Minsheng and Sanbei companies occasionally have ships going up and down the Yangtze River route, passenger and cargo transportation has not been satisfied. The China Merchants Bureau's commercial transportation only opened one Jianghan steamer to Hankou in the middle of last month. It returned to Shanghai from Yichang last Saturday with grain from Sichuan. Although it has been decided to sail to Hankou, the exact date has not been determined, and it is feared that passengers and cargo will be difficult to register. As for the Northern shipping route, there are numerous passengers and cargo, but there are no ships to load for the time being. Even several thousand tons of relief supplies are waiting. Even if ships sail north, they can only transport relief supplies first, and passengers and cargo are still hopeless. Customs brokers urgently hope that the China Merchants Bureau will find ways to allocate ships to reduce losses in various industries. It is also reported that the Taikoo Company's Hanyang steamer will sail from Shanghai to Qingdao this afternoon. In addition to the original cargo from Hong Kong to Qingdao, a small amount of cargo has also been loaded in this city.</p>

<h3>Returning Technical Personnel Feel Disappointed. The Ministry of Transportation's Agencies in Shanghai Jointly Hold a Welcome Party</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The agencies of the Ministry of Transportation in Shanghai jointly held a tea party at 4:00 p.m. yesterday on the second floor of the International Hotel to welcome more than 200 road, telecommunications, postal, and aviation trainees who recently returned from the United States. The Deputy Director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, Hou Yuhua, and others delivered welcome speeches and reported on the arrangements for receiving them in Beijing. The atmosphere was harmonious. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 p.m. All trainees will go to Beijing in batches from today to report to the Ministry of Transportation and wait for work assignments.</p>
<p>[Also reported] The reporter unexpectedly discovered an old friend, Mr. So-and-So, who went to the interior four years ago, among the returning personnel from the transportation industry on the second floor of the International Hotel yesterday. After reuniting, they shook hands and greeted each other. Mr. So-and-So graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Jiaotong University. He originally worked at the Guizhou Quanzhou Machine Factory of the Ministry of Transportation. In April of last year, he passed the trainee examination in Chongqing and flew to Calcutta, then took a cargo ship to the United States. After arriving, he was assigned to work in a factory of a railway company from Chicago to San Francisco. The training method was not to actually participate in work, but to visit and study in various departments. The expenses in the United States were initially paid by the U.S. under the Lend-Lease Act, because the original purpose was to train them to participate in the counterattack. However, with the early arrival of victory, the U.S. stopped supplying and switched to our government bearing the cost. When the reporter asked about his feelings after returning to China, he said that the first thing he felt was the huge difference in the standard of living and the material environment. The returning personnel all felt that Shanghai's narrowness and crowding was like a "pigeon coop." In addition, the government authorities did not seem to have a complete plan for their work after returning to China. Most people still have to find their own way, and they are particularly disappointed with the current general political and economic situation.</p>

<h3>The Reception Work Investigation Team Accepts Petitions from the People</h3>
<p>The Reception Work Investigation Team has actively launched an investigation. The team also sent letters to 90 party, government, and military reception agencies, requiring them to submit a brief report on the process of receiving and handling enemy and puppet materials within ten days.

<h3>The Housing Allocation Committee Is Unlikely to Be Abolished on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Administrative Yuan's Shanghai Agencies Housing Allocation Committee is facing difficulties because many houses left by enemy foreigners have been illegally occupied. The committee originally planned to be abolished by the end of August this year, but according to the current situation, it seems impossible. The "permits" for houses that have been approved for residence by various agencies are currently being filled out by the committee and will be completed in about two weeks. The issuance period is around the middle of next month.</p>
<h3>Complaints Can Be Filed if the Radio Station Investigation Is Unfair</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the simple radio stations in this city being shut down by the transportation authorities, the reporter asked the Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, Yu Lu'er, yesterday. According to him, after the restoration of this city, many radio stations were established, reaching more than a hundred. Their call signs and weekly rates were all self-determined and without any standards, which disrupted the order in the air. Not only were the bureau's radio stations affected, but the U.S. military also complained from time to time. If the radio stations that have been eliminated in this city believe that the investigators have acted unfairly, they can file a complaint with evidence. As for the aftercare methods requested by the eliminated radio stations, because they were established without authorization, there may be no legal basis for them.</p>

<h3>Yang Wendao, Who Has Been Imprisoned for Ten Years, Will Be Retried on Schedule. The Wrongful Conviction Has the Opportunity to Be Reversed Due to Victory. As Many as Eleven People Have Been Summoned at the Same Time. Tang Huaiqun Fulfills His Obligations to the End</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Yang Wendao case, which caused a national sensation eleven years ago, may have a chance to come to light recently. According to the case, Yang was identified as the murderer by the Japanese for the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideio on Guang Le An Road. The first and second trials both sentenced him to death. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which immediately ruled to send the case back to the original trial court for retrial. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and the national army moved west. The judgment could not be delivered, and Yang Wendao had to be imprisoned, awaiting execution under the threat of the enemy for ten years. After the victory, Yang's son, Hanzhi, ran around, and in the spring of this year, the Supreme Court approved Yang Wendao's release on bail for medical treatment. The judgment issued by the Supreme Court seven years ago was also delivered last month. It is learned that Yang Wendao has received a subpoena from the Second Criminal Division of the High Court to retry the case, instructing him to appear in court at 2:00 p.m. on August 17 for interrogation. As many as eleven people have been summoned at the same time, including Zeng Yuan (i.e., Zeng Yuanjia) and Yang Jianzhong, who reported Yang to the Japanese police chief as the murderer. In addition, Zhang Chen, a witness who was favorable to Yang Wendao, was also summoned, but it is heard that he was killed by the Japanese a few years ago. Wei Ligong, the forensic doctor who was responsible for examining Nakayama Hideio's body that year, and Zhang Zhirang, the lawyer appointed by the court as Yang's public defender, have also been summoned to testify. As for the lawyer hired by Yang Wendao this time, it is still Tang Huaiqun, who has been running around for Yang for more than ten years without taking a penny of public funds.</p>
<h3>The Manager of the "Legal" Fulai Qianzhuang, Lu Bingyuan, Is on Trial. On the Same Day, the High Court Retries Xu Jiang, Zou Shanbao, and Others</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Lu Bingyuan, the manager of "Fulai Qianzhuang," was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. The bank was jointly operated by the wife of the special agent demon Wu Shibao, She Aizhen, the deputy manager of the puppet Shanghai China Bank, Li Zulai, the chairman of the puppet Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, Ge Liangchou, and others, and Lu was appointed as the manager. It was registered in the puppet Ministry of Finance. In name, it deposited money, but in reality, it engaged in speculation and delivered the deposits to the "Central Reserve Bank" as reserves. Lu confessed in court yesterday that he had originally opened Daxinghao with others in Shanghai, engaged in remittance business. Later, he joined "Fulai Qianzhuang" as manager. He admitted that there were 20 million yuan in fake money used as reserves for the "Central Reserve Bank," but he denied speculation. He also claimed that the bank was a "legal" organization. The judge rebuked him for this law being the law of the puppet government. The case was adjourned for retrial. She Aizhen, Li Zulai, Ge Liangchou, and others are currently in custody. They may be questioned for confrontation during the next trial.</p>

<h3>A Profit of 200%. "Pocket Books" Have the Most Customers. "Life" and "Time" Are the Best Sellers</h3>
<p>Judging from the large number of Western books and magazines appearing on the market, the Western book industry seems to be booming.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the profit of operating Western books and magazines is quite amazing. Just to give two examples: The original price of Life magazine has recently risen to US$15 a year. Calculating that each issue is only about US$0.30, bookstores purchase it at an exchange rate of 2020, costing 600 yuan in national currency, but it sells for about 1,800 yuan on the market, a gross profit of 200%! Taking the recently arrived "pocket books" as an example, the original price is US$0.25. Adding postage or freight, the cost is less than US$0.30. When sold, some sell for 1,500 yuan, and the gross profit is also close to 200%! This is talking about the retail benefits. If customers entrust them to order on their behalf, if they do not directly pay in US dollars, bookstores generally charge at the black market exchange rate, so they make a profit in terms of exchange rates. As for encountering special transactions, the benefits are even more amazing. One day, the reporter met a friend from a fashion company, who said that recently many of their colleagues entrusted a bookstore to order some specialized magazines about fashion from the United States at a price of 6,000 yuan per copy. The original price of this magazine is only US$0.50. In other words, the cost incurred by the Western bookstore owner is only more than 1,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Although the profits of the Western book industry are so generous, people in the industry are still not very satisfied. They are talking about the hardship of having a large capital and slow turnover. One boss said, "Rather than taking 50 to 60 million yuan to open a Western bookstore, it is better to do other business, even just lending out short-term interest is enough." So now the few larger-scale stores are mostly old stores with a considerable history, or they are opened by friends who are interested in Western books, and their purpose is not just to make money.</p>
<p>As for the magazines that sell best, they are "Life" and "Time." Next are various movie magazines. As for books, the "pocket books" with low prices and good quality have the most customers. (Fan Shi)</p>
<h3>Judgement of Six Traitors. The Case of Qu Bin Is Concluded</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The High Court announced the judgment of several traitor cases yesterday morning: (1) Zhang Bingheng and Zhang Yizhi, who used hardware to support the enemy, were previously sentenced by the High Court to life imprisonment and 12 years of imprisonment, respectively. The defendants did not accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The retrial was held yesterday morning. Zhang Bingheng's sentence was changed to 10 years of imprisonment, and Zhang Yizhi's sentence was changed to 5 years of imprisonment. (2) Wang Luqing, the deputy manager of "Fuxing Bank," was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 3 years. (3) Li Changgeng, a grain merchant, was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 3 years for using food to support the enemy. (4) Jiang Guozhang, an iron casting merchant, was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 3 years for using military supplies to support the enemy. (5) Luo Zhiqiang, a secret agent of the enemy constitution, was sentenced to 1 year and 4 months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 2 years.</p>
<p>The case of Qu Bin was concluded on the same day, and the judgment was scheduled to be announced at 9:30 a.m. on August 5. In March 1938, Qu served as the Chief of the Daily Accounting Section of the enemy's Central China Telecommunications Company, bearing the responsibility of providing the enemy with telecommunications technology and statistics. In December 1944, he was sent to North China by the enemy to inspect the electrical machinery in Tianjin and Peiping. In June 1945, he returned to Shanghai and jointly operated Xinhua Electrical Factory with others. After the victory, he was arrested on suspicion of fraud. After investigation, he was suspected of being a traitor, and a public prosecution was filed.</p>

<h3>Bathhouse Workers Establish Reorganization Committee, Again Demanding 40/60 Split</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The dispute over the profit-sharing ratio between labor and management in the city's bathhouse industry has been ongoing for a long time. The workers are deeply dissatisfied with the labor union responsible for negotiations because the recent arbitration result from the city government has actually reduced their income.

<h3>Dismissal of Inspector General of Customs Bai Lichaz Clarified - Heart Condition Improving</h3>

<h3>Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is an Implementing Agency, Does Not Determine Any Methods, Released Statistics on Takeover and Handling Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the takeover and handling of enemy and puppet factories in this city, the person in charge of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region stated yesterday: This office was established on September 17th of last year, about a month after Japan's surrender. When the Ministry of Education took over the enemy and puppet factories, it was discovered that some factory equipment and materials had been stolen or lost. For each factory taken over by this office, an original inventory is listed. The personnel of this office and the Japanese handover personnel are responsible for stamping their seals separately as a preliminary basis. Afterwards, this office dispatched personnel to investigate. If the internal equipment did not match the original inventory, a separate handover inventory was created. In addition to investigating the reasons for the discrepancies, a comparative inventory was prepared with reference to the above two inventories as a basis for safekeeping. This office has taken over a total of 646 factory units, of which 133 units have been transferred to affiliated agencies of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for resumption of operations. The remaining 317 units are currently being processed. This office handles the takeover and handling work entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and is an implementing agency that does not determine any methods. For example, all procedures for factory bidding, including valuation, bid opening, and contract awarding, are determined by the Handling Bureau. After the property rights are reviewed and approved, this office is notified to handle them, and personnel are dispatched by the Handling Bureau to supervise the handover. As for factories returned to the original owners, if the Japanese have added equipment, in addition to handing over the original parts, matters regarding the valuation and bidding of nationalized materials are still determined by the Handling Bureau. Communication between this office and the Handling Bureau inevitably takes time. Outsiders are unaware of this and often accuse this office of intentionally delaying the return of factories, which is absolutely not the case. Finally, he stated that this office has always been very cautious in undertaking the takeover, safekeeping, and utilization of enemy and puppet factories, and that all matters must be decided by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau before being handled. There are very few errors in the procedures. However, with so many employees in this office, there are inevitably some who are dishonest and take advantage of their positions to engage in corruption. We hope that people in the community will maintain close contact with this office to facilitate reporting. If there are any questions about the takeover work, we also hope that they will come to the office to inquire at any time.</p>
<h3>Handling Bureau to Establish Committee for Bidding on Materials</h3>
<p>According to sources, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region will establish a committee for bidding on materials taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The committee will consist of three members each from the Enemy Property Handling Bureau and the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who will be responsible for presiding over the committee's affairs. In addition, the seventh batch of factories to be bid on will soon be announced.</p>
<h3>Collection of Land Tax in Kind in This City Expected to be Converted to Cash, Already Submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food for Instructions</h3>
<p>Starting September 1st, the collection of land tax in kind in the recovered areas will begin. Yesterday, the reporter visited the municipal finance authorities to inquire about the preparations for the collection of land tax in kind in this city. It was reported that the land tax in this city is being levied for the first time, but most of the land is urban, and the agricultural area is only over 500,000 mu (including river islands). Rice and wheat account for the smallest proportion of crops. During the enemy and puppet period, even with high-level collection in kind, only over 440 shi of rice and grain were collected annually. With a dense population and huge consumption, the people's food has always relied on neighboring areas. Land tax has always been paid in currency, and the people have long been accustomed to it. Public opinion in this city also does not favor collection in kind. At the same time, there are no facilities for warehouse storage and transportation, and the collecting personnel lack training. Collection in kind is prone to malpractices in terms of technique. Therefore, it is proposed that the land tax in this city be converted to legal tender in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on the Collection of Land Tax in Kind to facilitate implementation. This is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food for instructions. The reporter inquired about the standard of collection if the land tax is converted to legal tender in the future. It was reported that the following three methods will be used: (1) Based on the market price, (2) The price is stipulated by the municipal government, (3) Based on the average price of grain in a certain period. As for the tax amount, according to the recent central government regulations, the tax amount per mu was one yuan before the war, which should be converted to four dou, plus four dou for borrowing, plus 30% municipal public grain, totaling nine dou and two sheng.</p>
<h3>Jews Residing in China Should Apply for Registration in Accordance with the Law</h3>

However, it is reported that none of them have gone through the procedures so far, which is inconsistent with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Tram and Car Collide, Female Passenger Suffers Head Injury</h3>

<h3>Thug Opens Fire in Brothel, Came to Seek Pleasure, Almost Caused a Catastrophe</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 1:30 AM yesterday, a young man wearing a black serge suit and shorts suddenly broke into the room of Wang Maotou (18 years old, from Suzhou), a second-class prostitute at Hongxiang Hospital, No. 1, Lane 30, Dongxinqiao Street. The madam, Xing Xu, demanded a night fee of 30,000 yuan. The young man became angry because the price was too high and slapped her. He then drew a gun and fired a warning shot, piercing the floor of the room where prostitute Mei Hong lived on the second floor. The bullet landed on the bed, where two children were sleeping, fortunately without injury. After the incident, the man went out and fled.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Theft of Passenger and Cargo at Various Docks, Customs and Port Authority Formulate Simple Rules</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Large-scale thefts have been occurring frequently in the warehouses of various docks in this city recently. The losses of cargo owners are considerable, with the amount of losses reaching more than 40% in serious cases, which is truly shocking. This newspaper has previously reported on this matter. Mayor Wu also convened various relevant authorities at the City Government at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month to hold a meeting on preventing theft at various docks. Many measures were proposed on the spot, instructing various relevant authorities to cooperate in prevention.</p>
<p>The reporter especially visited the Jianghai Customs and Port Authority yesterday. It was reported that thefts of passenger and cargo on docks have been found in all major cities in the world. The only difference is the degree. However, what is most difficult to deal with at present is that some crew members and employees on some ships are also colluding in theft. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities of various shipping companies will do their best to cooperate with the port police. If a theft occurs, they should notify immediately for investigation. The office has also formulated nine simple rules, hoping that the authorities of training ships will pay attention to them: (1) Do not allow unauthorized personnel to board the ship. (2) Personnel serving on the ship or allowed to enter and exit should carry armbands, passes, or identification documents. (3) If unscrupulous elements cause difficulties, please notify the port police immediately by signal or telephone. (4) Arrest thieves, regardless of the size of the case, and send them to the port police. (5) Do not dispose of any theft case without authorization. All theft cases should be reported to the port police for inspection. (6) Do not sell luggage or discarded items on the ship without the approval of the customs authorities. (7) Selling items on the ship is likely to lure unscrupulous elements, resulting in theft cases. (8) Do not use physical objects as wages for painters or small workers, as the items may be prohibited from import by customs or still subject to tax. (9) The port police are willing to dispatch to assist in investigations at any time and place upon receiving a signal or telephone notification. Port Police Headquarters Telephone (office hours) 15529, extensions 37 and 78. Direct outside lines 12371, 50382 and 12796. Telephone after office hours 50382. Port Police Chief's residence telephone 70216.</p>

<h3>Two Russian Criminals who Robbed Cars and Sold Weapons Escorted for Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Second Criminal Court of the District Court, presided over by Judge Wu Xiangzu, opened the trial of the case of the White Russian robbery of wealth, car theft, and sale of weapons. It was reported that Russian gangsters Yagoranfu and Borisyukofu made a living by blackmail and fraud. They met the car driver He Guofu through the introduction of American soldiers to "wild chicken" cars. The owner of He Guofu's car was He Kechang, the secretary of the former Third Front Army Command, and the car number was 15319.

<h3>Philippine Overseas Chinese Basketball Team Returns to Motherland: The Qunsheng Team to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month: With an Impressive Record of Six Wins and One Loss in the Philippines: Currently Competing in Xiamen, Soon to Head North</h3>
<p>The Philippine Overseas Chinese Qunsheng Basketball Team sent a letter to the basketball committee of this city's Sports Association two months ago, expressing their intention to return to the motherland for a tour. The basketball committee expressed its welcome. However, due to the difficulty in purchasing ship tickets, the trip was delayed until recently. They have now departed the Philippines for Xiamen on the 25th of this month. After competing in Xiamen, they will take a ship to Shanghai. The supervisory committee, considering that the basketball season is over and other issues, had previously telegraphed the team, requesting them to come after the weather cools down in the autumn. However, this telegram was likely not received. Yesterday, the Qunsheng Team telegraphed their representative in Shanghai, Cai Dawen, stating that they had decided to leave Xiamen for Shanghai in early August, and it is expected that they will arrive at the coast before the 10th of next month. This plan is likely to be realized. It is said that the team's strength is extremely formidable, with a record of six wins and one loss in seven games in the Philippines. This should not be underestimated. Therefore, the leading basketball teams in this city should immediately prepare for the upcoming major battles to be prepared.

<h3>Visiting Feng Youlan at Zhang Zhidong's Former Residence</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Beiping, Song Shaobo</p>
<p>In the misty rain, this reporter went to the right bank of Houhai to visit Mr. Feng Youlan, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Tsinghua University, who is about to go to the United States to lecture. Mr. Feng had only been in Beiping for four days since arriving from Chongqing. When the reporter knocked on the door, it was just as Mr. Feng and his wife were returning from outside. Mr. Feng, who is in his fifties, has grown a thick black beard about four or five inches long, paired with a pair of nearsighted glasses, and wearing a white silk gown, he has the air of a Daoist priest. His wife is young and plump, and seemed to be returning from a walk at a friend's house. After some inquiries, Mr. Feng politely invited the reporter in. Four or five families of Mr. Feng's relatives and friends lived in the two sections of the courtyard, so it was quite messy. Mr. Feng lived in the last row of rooms, which was a very spectacular deep mansion. Its original owner was Zhang Zhidong. With three courtyards in a row, Mr. Feng bought the middle residence before the incident. Mr. Feng said this, pointing to a room at the north end: "Zhang Zhidong died in that room." Mr. Feng's children were sorting books. Although this house had been occupied for eight years, Mr. Feng's books were fortunate enough to remain lost.</p>
<p>Mourning Wen Yiduo</p>
<p>Sitting on an old sofa, we first talked about Wen Yiduo's assassination. Mr. Feng said that this was an irreparable loss to the Chinese academic community. He said: "Mr. Wen is the most accomplished in studying native literature and art after receiving training in Western literature and art. Although there are others, no one can catch up with Wen Guangsheng's achievements. Although he wrote a lot about Tang poetry, Chu Ci, the Book of Songs, and the Book of Changes, they have not been compiled together. The Department of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University should organize this unfinished work for him." Regarding Mr. Wen's political interests, it is said that: "Originally, he was close to the nationalist faction. After arriving at Tsinghua, he no longer paid attention to politics and buried himself in research. In Kunming, he didn't even read the newspapers for a year or two. However, in the past two or three years, because he was dissatisfied with the political situation, he became interested in politics again, and the result was like this!" Mr. Feng also said: "On the night of May 25th, the night before I left Kunming, we were still together."</p>
<p>Views on the Current Situation</p>
<p>From Wen Yiduo's death, we talked about the current situation. Mr. Feng politely and cautiously did not express much. He said that there are fundamental contradictions between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and that any country has different forces of radicalism and gradualism, opposing parties that overthrow and maintain, but unlike China, where there is so much mutual distrust. Therefore, Mr. Feng believes that it is indeed difficult for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to come together, but ultimately they "should reconcile," and this can only be built on mutual concessions. Mr. Feng said that he is not interested in politics because he believes that a person's mental time is limited. Focusing on the research of one academic career may lead to success, but taking care of too much makes it difficult.</p>
<p>Comments on the Beiping Student Protests</p>
<p>Regarding the student protests caused by the takeover of major universities in Beiping, Mr. Feng believes that it is right for some people to insist on maintaining the history, spirit, and traditions of the original school. Mr. Feng believes that Normal University should be restored. Judging from the historical scale of Normal University, it should be. However, there is no Normal University organization in the country now, which may be the difficulty for the Ministry of Education not to change the Normal College to Normal University. In short, in his view, the authorities have not prevented the development of schools that meet the conditions such as history and scale.</p>
<p>Going to the United States in Mid-August</p>
<p>Mr. Feng will leave Beiping for Shanghai in mid-August, and then take a ship to Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, USA, to lecture on "History of Chinese Philosophy" for a year. His wife will go with him. According to Mr. Feng, the lectureship in the United States was agreed upon a year ago, so even though Tsinghua University is returning, it is not good not to keep the appointment. The income from lecturing in the United States is about four to five hundred US dollars per month.</p>
<p>The reporter asked Mr. Feng about his research work in recent years. He said: In the rear area in recent years, he has organized and published "New Rational Learning," "New Theories of Events," "New World Teachings," "New Origins of Man," "New Origins of the Way," and recently prepared to publish "New Words of Knowledge," which was printed by his father's Commercial Press. At this time, a junior who resembled Mr. Feng said: "There is no one else who has achieved such great achievements in the study of philosophy!" Mr. Feng repeatedly said, "Not at all!" His Henan accent remained the same.</p>
<p>Talking about his feelings about returning to the north, Mr. Feng said happily: "We are much luckier than the Song and Jin people. After they crossed south, they were unable to return, but we have returned. This is unprecedented in history!"</p>
<p>Mr. Feng also lamented the difficulties of returning. He said: In the past, when we waited for a plane, it didn't count unless we got on it, but recently we have gone a step further, and it doesn't count unless we get off, because we often turn back after getting on. The three schools of the Southwest Associated University, which were originally scheduled to return last winter, have not yet returned to the chaos of the civil war, which has affected everything. Mr. Feng, who did not want to express his opinions on the current situation, also shook his head and sighed. When the reporter said goodbye, he saw one of his students of many years come to greet him. (35, 7/24)</p>
<p>Civil Administration Briefs</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Reiterates Order: Civil Servants May Not Hold Concurrent Positions: Municipal Government Issues Circular to All Agencies to Strictly Comply</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan, upon the order of the National Government, believes that the state establishes offices and assigns responsibilities, each with its own specific duties, originally expecting officials to exert their strength in their positions and have no distractions. If they take on other tasks in addition to their primary duties, serving multiple roles, they are bound to neglect one thing and lose another, leading to exhaustion. This will not only make it difficult to achieve governance, but also disrupt official norms. It has long been stipulated in the Civil Servant Service Law that civil servants may not hold other official positions or concurrent jobs, and the government has repeatedly emphasized this over the years. Previously, according to the resolutions of the Central Party, Government, and Military Affairs on improving administrative efficiency and the general review meeting of the "Administrative Two-Link System" to focus on responsibilities and crack down on concurrent jobs, the government issued an order to that effect. However, fearing that people would become lax over time and that there would still be instances of outwardly complying but inwardly disobeying, the Central Executive Committee sent a letter with the resolution passed by the Second Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Central Executive Committee on the personnel reform section (7): "One person, one position. Unless absolutely necessary, concurrent positions are not allowed." The Executive Yuan should reiterate the previous order, instructing the heads of all agencies to strictly comply without any favoritism. The order arrived in the city yesterday, and the Municipal Government issued a circular to all its subordinate agencies to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of "Civil Servants" in the Election Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of the Interior yesterday issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments, stating: "Regarding how the scope of 'civil servants' mentioned in Article 2, Section 1 of the Provincial Council Election Law should be defined, there is no clear provision in the law. We have submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation. Now, we have received the Executive Yuan's instruction No. 8227, Jieshi, dated March 18 of this year, stating: 'Submitted and noted. The Judicial Yuan replied in letter No. 3088, Yuanjie, dated February 25, 35 of the Republic of China: "Civil servants with legally established titles in national government agencies, even if they exceed the quota, are still 'civil servants' as mentioned in Article 11, Section 1 of the Provincial Councilors Election Law. Employees of state-owned enterprises established by law, if they are subject to appointment, are also 'civil servants' as mentioned in the same section, even if the agency does not have organizational regulations. Those currently holding such positions should have their right to be elected suspended. Regular active-duty soldiers or police officers, even if they exceed the quota, are also subject to Section 2 of the same article," etc. We hereby instruct you to inform the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the provincial and municipal governments to inform their subordinates.' In addition to issuing instructions separately, we hereby request you to investigate and inform your subordinates."</p>
<h3>22nd District Distributes Flour</h3>
<p>The 22nd District distributed relief flour to extremely poor households yesterday (26th) morning from 9:00 AM. The district had previously stipulated that the 1st, 8th, 9th, 11th, 10th, and 12th neighborhoods would be distributed in the morning, and the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th neighborhoods would be distributed in the afternoon. Therefore, the temporary order was good. Recipients, whether with one or two bags, carried them on their backs or shoulders, all beaming with joy.</p>
<h3>11th District Establishes Four Committees</h3>
<p>The 11th District Office (Xincheng) has established four committees - design, economic, health, and cultural - in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of District and Neighborhood Associations, in order to achieve the broad effect of collecting consultation and assistance. Currently, more than fifty local dignitaries, including Wang Xiao, Xu Guomao, Gu Yuqi, Zhao Jinqing, Ren Jinping, and He Peirong, have been appointed to serve as chairmen, vice chairmen, and members of the aforementioned committees.</p>
<p>Cultural Committee The district's Cultural Committee held a committee meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the memorial hall of Qinghua Primary and Secondary School on Baker Road. Zhao Jinqing was elected as the chairman, and Jiang Jizhou and two others were elected as vice chairmen.

<h3>Assisting Production, Enriching People's Food Supply: Wheat and Salt Loans Established Simultaneously. Secretary-General Xu Personally Presides in Shanghai. 15 Billion Yuan for Each Initiative.</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with national policies, stabilize salt prices, and secure the livelihood of salt producers, the Four Joint Offices (四聯總處) have specially launched business loans, established a loan syndicate to handle various loans for production, transportation, and transport equipment. Furthermore, to increase production, enrich the food supply, and stabilize grain prices, wheat loans have also been launched, forming a wheat loan syndicate. Simultaneously, groups of salt and wheat loan review committees were established to be responsible for reviewing loan matters. The two committees held their establishment meetings simultaneously yesterday (29th) at 10:00 AM in the conference room of the Four Joint Offices' Shanghai Branch. Secretary-General Xu Boyuan (徐柏園) of the Four Joint Offices was dispatched to Shanghai to preside over the meetings. Committee members Huo Yamin (霍亞民), Wang Zishuang (王紫霜), Cai Gongchun (蔡公椿), Pan Jiufen (潘久芬), Zhu Tongjiu (朱通九), Xue Dijin (薛迪錦), Huang Yinpu (黄蔭普), Shen Jing (沈鏡), Chen Rujin (陳如金) of the Salt Affairs Administration, Wang Junliang (汪君良) of the Food Department, and guests Zhao Dihua (趙棣華), Bian Baimei (卞白眉), Lin Fengbao (林鳳苞), Shen Xirui (沈熙瑞), and more than twenty others attended. Secretary-General Xu chaired the meeting. Mr. Xu first explained the significance of the establishment and reported on the three major directives of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman Song of the Four Joint Offices: (1) The handling must be thorough and practical, suitable for the times, and genuinely effective; (2) The principles must be open, fair, and just; (3) The purpose is to benefit the country, the people, and ourselves. Mr. Xu elaborated on these three points and hoped that all members of the two committees would earnestly follow them. Subsequently, Chen Rujin, Huo Yamin, Lin Fengbao, Bian Baimei, Wang Junliang, Zhao Dihua, Shen Xirui, Pan Jiufen, and others expressed their opinions separately. Then, proposals were discussed and it was decided that on the 29th and 30th, review committee meetings would be held separately to decide on the methods for granting salt and wheat loans, following the principles instructed by the Board of Directors of the Four Joint Offices, and that the loan syndicate should expedite the granting of loans to avoid delays. Vice-Chairman Song has already appointed Huo Yamin, Chairman of the Loan Committee of the Four Joint Offices, to also serve as the Chairman of the Salt Loan Review Committee. Zhao Dihua, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and Li Shuming, General Manager of the Farmers Bank, will serve concurrently as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Wheat Loan Review Committee. According to Secretary-General Xu of the Four Joint Offices, the details of the handling of the two types of loans are as follows:</p>
<p>Salt Loans to be Piloted for Six Months</p>
<p>In May of this year, the Office received instructions from the Chairman and Vice-Chairman that salt loans should have a complete set of procedures. In compliance, the Salt Administration Bureau was requested to provide a complete set of procedures for overall planning. Later, the Salt Administration Bureau replied that the general situation in the country was not yet stable, and the conditions in various salt-producing areas were different. While the salt industry relied on financial adjustments, loans must ensure safety. It was proposed to start with the Sichuan salt-producing area and the Huai area (i.e., the Yangtze River basin), which had the widest sales area, the largest amount of funds used, and were relatively safe, and pilot the project for six months. At that time, the situation would be assessed and adjustments would be made. The proposed total loan amount was 49.4 billion yuan, divided into: (1) Production loans of 12.4 billion yuan; (2) Salt transportation loans of 31 billion yuan; (3) Transportation equipment loans of 6 billion yuan. The Board of Directors initially approved a loan amount of 45 billion yuan (temporarily removing 5 billion yuan from the original production loan for the Huaibei, Huainan, and Shandong areas). Various banks were to form a syndicate to invite commercial firms to participate. Subsequently, after repeated invitations to representatives from various banks and the Salt Administration Bureau to discuss the organizational regulations of the Joint Loan Review Committee and the organizational regulations of the ×× Area Salt Loan Syndicate, the 311th Board of Directors meeting on July 11th resolved to amend and approve them separately, and then sent letters to various banks and the Salt Administration Bureau to recommend representatives to jointly organize. Yesterday afternoon, the Salt Loan Review Committee convened its first meeting to study the loan policy and make specific decisions on the term, interest rate, target, and method. The main focus was on salt production and sales, and restrictive lending for financing purposes was implemented. The Salt Administration Bureau was responsible for preliminary review, followed by a review by the syndicate, and a post-event audit to ensure thoroughness, improve the quality of salt, reduce the burden on salt producers, and increase national treasury revenue. Finally, it was also planned to establish syndicates in Chongqing and Hankou (named the Sichuan-Kang District Salt Syndicate, with a total amount of 17.2 billion yuan).</p>
<p>Wheat Loans Total 30 Billion</p>
<p>Considering that the new wheat of this year has already entered the market, in order to cooperate with the government's food policy, assist various flour mills in purchasing raw materials in a timely manner, actively produce, so as to enrich the food supply and stabilize grain prices, the Four Joint Offices designated the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank to invite various banks and relevant competent authorities, as well as representatives from the Flour Industry Association, to discuss repeatedly, first to launch loans to various factories in the Fourth District to assist in the purchase of wheat, and with reference to the Salt Affairs General Loan case, proposed the method of organizing a syndicate, and jointly submitted it to the 311th Board of Directors meeting on July 11 for approval to handle wheat loans of 30 billion yuan, and approved the organizational regulations of the Wheat Loan Review Committee and the Wheat Loan Syndicate, and distributed them to various banks and relevant agencies to recommend representatives to jointly organize.</p>
<p>The above two matters are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, maintaining producers on the one hand and consumers on the other. In particular, if the wheat loans are handled properly, the planned allocation of food will be of great help to the food public sales system.</p>
<h3>Gold Deposits: Starting Next Week, Redeemable in Shanghai, Choice of Cash or Gold</h3>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to prevent inflation and stabilize prices, the government, through the Central Bank, launched a method of gold deposits converted from legal tender, implemented by various banks in the rear. Purchasers were enthusiastic. It is now reliably learned that in order to facilitate the accounts of depositors who purchased this gold deposit certificate, starting next week, all can be redeemed in Shanghai's various banks by means of collection, whether in national currency or gold, according to the convenience of the customer.</p>
<h3>Gold and Currency Both Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the selling pressure from US dollar side and the oppression of sources, the Gold Note market was lifeless. The opening price had already retreated to 1.915 million, and this price was still surrounded by sellers. After the opening, it continued to fall to around 1.895 million. After 10 o'clock, the central government allocated 77 registered items at a price of 1.895 million. After that, it became even more mediocre, struggling between 1.89 million and 1.9 million. It was not until near noon that it crossed the 1.9 million mark. In the afternoon, it initially stabilized and then rebounded, first seeing a volume of 1.91 million, but finally retreated to around 1.895 million. As a result, it fell another 30,000 compared to last Saturday. Decorated gold was 10,003,000, silver was flat, silver dollars fell slightly, and the interest rate for informal discounts was still between 10% and 15%.</p>
<p>There were actual US dollars flowing out of the foreign currency market, and the market was relatively inferior in the middle. However, there was a lot of activity among those who exchanged gold for currency. After falling, it was easy to rebound. Yesterday, the opening price was 2,510 yuan with sellers, and supplies from Hong Kong soon fell to 2,470 yuan, and only then did speculative buying maintain it. At noon, it rose slightly and hovered around 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it was initially stable and then weakened, retreating from around 2,510 yuan to within 2,500 yuan. As a result, it fell 40 yuan compared to last Saturday. The buying and selling price of Hong Kong dollars was slightly widened, and as a result, it rose slightly by 2 yuan. The US dollar exchange rate, British exchange rate, rupee, and Hong Kong telegram were all the same as last Saturday.</p>
<p>Unified Class C Bonds Fall Slightly</p>
<p>The public bond market was stable, and trading was slightly active. The opening price fell slightly, and it was not until near noon that it rose slightly. The opening price of Unified Class C bonds was around 700 yuan, and only then did it maintain. At noon, it rose to 750 yuan and hovered. As a result, it fell slightly by 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. Other bonds did not fare much better or worse.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Hover, Foreign Stocks Sluggish</h3>
<p>The situation of Chinese stocks was erratic. Powerful players first advanced and then retreated. After rising near noon, they retreated slightly. The situation in the middle was slightly tortuous, first low and then high. Yong Yarn (永紗) had a low price of 655 yuan, Mayar (美亞) 4,250 yuan, King Fook (景福) 245 yuan, New Kwong (新光) 238 yuan, and Kan Hing (勤興) 175 yuan. Near noon, when they were the most popular, Yong Yarn was 690 yuan, Mayar 4,470 yuan, King Fook 260 yuan, New Kwong 255 yuan, and Kan Hing 190 yuan. When closing near noon, the strong faction sold off a little, and they all suddenly fell. As a result, the five popular stocks of Yong Yarn, Mayar, King Fook, New Kwong, and Kan Hing were similar to last Saturday. The smaller and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks had little change. Sun Hing (信和) opened as a new stock, which was similar to before the stock swap.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were still not vigorous. At the opening, they were slightly stable. Ewo Yarns (怡紗) were bought at 8,900 yuan, and British American Tobacco (英聯) at 9,000 yuan also had buyers, but they still felt soft when closing. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jardine Matheson (會德豐), Ewo Yarns, and British American Tobacco were flat, while those that were less popular fell slightly by about 5%. There were even fewer transactions, and it was extremely sluggish.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Remains Weak, Fabric Transactions Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fatigue of the yarn market had not been eliminated. Although the simultaneous transactions of 20-count Double Horse (雙馬) from the same industry raised the price by 20,000, actual sales were sluggish, and few customers made any moves. Smaller and medium-sized yarns were sold at lower prices, and they were particularly controlled by the owner, and the price fell by 10,000-20,000. Fine yarns also lacked vigor. At noon, Textile Construction (紡建) opened the yarn list as usual. There were no allotments for 42-count yarn. Only Li Ma (立馬) and Yang (陽) brands were available for 20-count yarn, and the amount was still very limited.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was flat and tired, and transactions were very rare. The majority of manufacturers, in view of the recent sharp decline in US cotton, still held a wait-and-see attitude. Only Hung Chang (鴻章) and Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory (南通大生紗廠) made slight purchases, 300-400 bales of ordinary middling cotton, and 300-400 bales of Uruguayan cotton for in-house trading.</p>
<p>Actual sales of fabric were sluggish, and people's minds were tending downwards. Leading brands of drill (嘰) fell by 250-500 yuan in the afternoon, and there were very few spot transactions.</p>
<h3>French Vietnam Freezes Legal Tender Deposits, Restrictions on Carrying and Remitting Money</h3>
<p>The spokesman of the French Commissioner's Office in North Vietnam announced on the 27th that any person of any nationality residing in Vietnam is limited to carrying 1,000 Vietnamese dong per person. Overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam who wish to remit money back to the country for family use are limited to 5,000 Vietnamese dong per household per month and must be accepted by the Banque de l'Indochine and the Sino-French Bank. All commercial remittances are limited to 2,500 Vietnamese dong, also limited to the above two banks. According to a reporter from the Central News Agency, all national currency deposits of overseas Chinese in the Chinese Bank of Communications in Hanoi and Haiphong have been frozen at the request of the authorities and are not allowed to be withdrawn, but they are still allowed to remit these frozen national currency deposits back to the country. The purpose of this measure is to reduce the circulation of national currency in Vietnam in order to stabilize the value of Vietnamese currency. The total amount of frozen national currency is about 2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Price Review Slightly Reduced, Vegetable Oil Factories Continue to Sell</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau's Grain Review Committee convened its 11th par price review meeting yesterday afternoon as usual. Attending were Ji Mingzhai (吉明齋), head of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, Zhao Gongran (趙公然), representative of the Provisional Senate, and grain merchants Zhang Xichao (張錫潮), Cai Shengming (蔡聲明), Wang Bingkun (王炳坤), Zhao Xingjie (趙行潔), and Yin Fuxiang (印福祥). After discussion, (1) those maintaining the original price were: white japonica rice 64,000 yuan, thin indica rice 64,000 yuan, and sheep indica rice 63,000 yuan; (2) those re-examined were: port indica rice 56,000 yuan (originally 58,000 yuan), door sales 61,000 yuan, milled currency 51,000 yuan (originally 53,000 yuan), door sales 56,000 yuan, white indica rice 46,000 yuan (originally 50,000 yuan), door sales 50,500 yuan. Although the prices set this time are lower than the last time, they are still higher than the market prices. The reason is to encourage rice merchants to purchase and transport and increase rice reserves. All will be offered on the market at the stated prices today. And because the grain market is becoming more and more regular, the Social Bureau has slightly changed the review date, every Wednesday and Friday, as the par price review day.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 piculs arrived in the north and south markets yesterday. Digestion of white japonica rice was sporadic. The market was strong and secondary rice was tired. The supply of indica rice exceeded demand, and it was extremely sluggish. There was also a situation of raising prices and killing secondary goods. White yuan shops selected high-quality goods, which was still active. Secondary goods were also rarely asked about. There were rumors in the flour market that the ban would be lifted, and people's hearts were flourishing. Prices rose by 500-600 yuan. Due to the shortage of boat spaces, small wheat bulk cargoes outside the gang had no intention of buying, and transactions were rare and the market was particularly tired. Hulls were rarely seen rising. The factory's wheat also rose by 600-700 yuan along with the flour price. New soybeans continued to arrive, and the market situation was flat. The oil market did not open, and external trading of raw oil shouted up to 88,000 to 89,000 yuan, and soybean oil was 84,000 yuan. It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' China Vegetable Oil Factory has ample reserves, so it decided to stabilize oil prices as much as possible. Yesterday, the factory still sold 700 barrels of raw rapeseed oil at a price of 68,000 yuan per load, which was 6,000 yuan cheaper per load than the market price, and it will continue to be sold today.</p>
<h3>Tea Market is Very Active in Domestic Sales</h3>
<p>Of the new goods of Sian (泗安) Chouchun (抽珍), only 24 boxes have been taken up by the Indian merchant Yulong Yanghang (裕隆洋行), at a price of 200,500 yuan per load, sold by the Xinhua Tea Factory (新華茶廠). In addition, the British merchant Harmony Yanghang (協和洋行) took in 72 boxes of aged Keemun (祁門), at a price of 77,000 yuan per load. As for domestic sales, it is still very active. Wang Yutai (汪裕泰) handled 200 boxes of aged Keemun, and Wuyuan (婺源) took 404 baskets of aged fried green tea at the same time. The Shandong gang picked up 50 baskets of Zhongzhu Jasmine (中珠蘭). Other old Keemun, Taiwan black tea, Yushan new fried green, new Longjing, etc., are all being taken up by Dadao shops and customers, and the quotations of each stall are all up.</p>
<h3>Taiwan has 210,000 Tons of Stored Sugar, Transportation Difficulties Cause Great Losses to the Company</h3>
<p>The biggest difficulty currently facing the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is transportation blockage. Tseng Chao-cheng (曾昭承), deputy director of the Taiwan Provincial Sugar Production Takeover Committee, told reporters yesterday, "10,000 tons of sugar are currently stored in Keelung Port and cannot be transported for export. The warehouses are small and the warehouse rents are high, causing considerable losses to the company." Taiwan Sugar relies entirely on the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) to transport to Shanghai. The reporter then interviewed Chen Dekun (陳德坤), manager of the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He said: In the past two weeks, ships sailing from Shanghai to Taiwan totaled 4,000 tons, all for other uses. There will be no ships transporting sugar for export in the coming week. Taiwan Sugar Corporation received 150,000 tons of sugar stored by the Japanese, and has produced 86,000 tons since the takeover. However, Taiwan Sugar only first transported sugar for export in May of this year. To date, the total amount of sugar transported to Shanghai is 19,200 tons. At present, there are still 216,800 tons of sugar stored in Taiwan Province. Tseng Chao-cheng said: The inability to transport the stored sugar has caused the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's capital turnover to be inflexible. At present, the company relies on loans from the Taiwan Bank to maintain its business. He believes that if the transportation problem is solved, the monthly transportation volume can exceed the 10,000 tons hoped for by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Tenth Sugar Falls Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight decline due to rumors that Chaoqing (潮靑) was being loaded again. Goods labeled with 10th grade from Shantou gangs opened at 90,500 yuan to 90,000 yuan, Huanggangqing (黃崗靑) at 88,000 yuan, a decrease of 1,000-2,000 yuan, and Zusanjians (足三尖) at 143,000 yuan, with a hundred-odd bales traded. Xinghua gangs opened with Shanggong Fenbai (上貢粉白) at 132,000 yuan to 130,000 yuan to 127,800 yuan, secondary goods at 114,000-5,000 yuan, and Xinghua red at 114,000-5,000 yuan to 112,000-3,000 yuan, for a total of over a hundred baskets.</p>
<h3>Prioritize Rear Area Industries: Auctioning Enemy and Puppet Factories, 30% Discount, Installment Payments</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau (敵偽產業處理局), after receiving enemy and puppet factories, in addition to the 68 that have already been auctioned off, will continue to auction off the rest. It is possible to allocate dozens of factories to be sold to rear area industrialists at 70% of the original estimated price, and installment payments are allowed to show preferential treatment. According to the installment payment method, the first installment is to pay one-third of the total amount, and the second installment is to be paid six months later, with the total amount to be paid off within one year. As for the rear area industrialists' firm request to undertake enemy and puppet factories unconditionally, it is feared that it will be difficult to handle. The list of meritorious rear area industrialists is currently being discussed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Ship Sails from Shanghai to Chongqing Carrying Large Quantities of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Minsheng Company's Minben ship (民本輪), after repairs, has resumed sailing. It is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Chongqing tomorrow morning. There are not many passengers, but a large amount of commercial goods, including more than 500 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, and many hardware and sundries, are berthed at Wharf 12 on the Bund. Loading was carried out day and night yesterday, and the ship will weigh anchor this morning ahead of schedule. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Linsen ship (林森輪) sailed directly to Shantou yesterday, carrying over 6,100 bags of wheat, over 1,200 bags of beans, 9,500 pieces of soybean cake, over 840 pieces of cotton yarn, and approximately over 3,000 pieces of sundries from Shanghai. The Jiangping ship (江平輪) sailed to Qingdao yesterday, carrying 1,400 tons of rice. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship (漢陽輪) is sailing to Qingjin (靑津) this afternoon, originally carrying 1,500 tons of cotton from the Shanghai Relief Administration, 1,500 bags of wheat, and 200 tons of canned food from this city to Qingdao. There are no goods in Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Yangquan Coal Loosens</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of large quantities of Yangquan lump coal via the Zhonglian ship (中連輪), the white coal market has loosened, and some peers have taken advantage of the high prices to pre-sell futures, so the price of Yangquan lump coal has fallen below the 400,000 mark, and there are sellers at 390,000 yuan. High-grade bituminous coal lump is being purchased by all parties, and the market is short of goods, and the trend is quite strong, and the market price continues to rise. The sales of the white coal layer is active, while the sales of the bituminous coal layer is still similar to the previous one, the former selling actively and the latter selling slowly. The sales of firewood and charcoal has been slightly affected since the price increase.</p>
<h3>Lumber Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the lumber market was slightly weak due to the continued arrival of foreign pine. The price of fir wood was still stable. Currently, the market price of Lauan is still firm due to the dwindling inventory, and the rest are in a weak state.</p>
<h3>Longkou Noodles Rising</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli, recently due to the scarcity of arrivals and the active sales, the market is quite tight, and it has risen again. Customer goods opened at over 200,000 mark to 220,000 yuan, and trade goods were sold at 230,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mexican Gold Arrives in Hong Kong in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>May Flow Back into China</p>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 28th] A large amount of gold flowed into Hong Kong from Mexico last week, causing fierce fluctuations in the black market for gold, but the general trend is downward, because of the insecurity of Chinese currency and the scarcity of US dollar exchange, so gold must be imported. Most of the gold will be shipped to mainland China, but Hong Kong authorities prohibit the export of gold. Employees of various foreign banks told United Press reporters that the price of Mexican gold is 36 US dollars per ounce, and the price in Hong Kong is 90 US dollars. At the beginning of last week, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was 430 yuan in legal tender, and at the weekend it had fallen to 358 yuan in legal tender, because of rumors that many foreign banks would sell 40-day futures at prices lower than the black market. As a result, it fell again to 368 yuan in legal tender at yesterday's closing.</p>

<h3>The Tide of Guangling in July</h3>
<p>— This newspaper's Sixth of the Month Yangzhou Dispatch, Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan</p>
<p>It is very obvious that for the past ten days or so, due to reports in newspapers across Nanjing and Shanghai, and indeed due to the situation in northern Jiangsu, there has been conflict everywhere. It is said that those living away from their hometowns here are genuinely and suddenly filled with worries!</p>
<p>Conflict Everywhere, Travelers Hesitate</p>
<p>In reality, the situation encountered in Yangzhou for the past ten days or so is not as entirely serious as some newspapers have reported or as those concerned have overly worried. However, those living away from their hometowns here often write home, urging their families to leave Yangzhou as soon as possible, or they disregard the hardship of traveling in the hot weather and make a special trip back to Yangzhou to check on things, expressing their so-called "lack of peace of mind." On the other hand, there are also merchants from Yangzhou who are temporarily traveling outside the city. In the past few days, rumors spread that they were so frightened by the "atmosphere" that they dared not rashly return to their hometowns, hesitating in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang. I, as the reporter, learned of this situation in the past few days from conversations with two relatives and friends who had already returned to Yangzhou. And one can imagine that when the situation here was indeed more tense for those few days, there must have been many people who considered Yangzhou to be "in imminent danger."</p>
<p>All Parties Calmly and Composedly Cope</p>
<p>Now, allow me, the reporter, "being here in person," to tell you: It is indeed a fact that the Communist army has plans to attack Yangzhou City. However, when the Communist army carried out "destroying the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway," "attacking the Fairy Maiden Temple," and "raiding the White Pagoda River," the general state of society here did not show any panic. On the contrary, the official parties like the party, government, military, and police, were all very calm in all aspects and radiated a spirit of composed response. The general public was also the same. Although they may have had "plans for the worst-case scenario," they never experienced panic. There are reasons for this: first, people somewhat understand that the strength of the garrisoned troops is such that they can ensure the security of Yangzhou; second, people believe that the garrisoned troops would never let Yangzhou fall into the hands of the Communist army; third, people understand that in terms of terrain, Yangzhou is only separated from Zhenjiang by a river, with the "Yangzhou Embankment Highway," which is only about thirty miles long, and this is a good military supply line. Moreover, according to what I know, the garrisoned troops themselves have full confidence in ensuring the security of Yangzhou.</p>
<p>The Communist Army Is Less Than Ten Miles Away</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 21st, I met with Director Yan of the Political Department of the garrisoned troops here, and he said: "Even if the Communist army comes with a hundred thousand people to attack Yangzhou, we won't buy it!" I believe that his words are not meaningless bravado, because I, although untalented, have had more than four years of military experience in "defending against the enemy and preventing traitors." Based on my observation, if we compare the "combat strength" (including weapons and equipment, and combat personnel's experience in large-scale battles, etc.) of the Communist army with the "combat strength" (same content as above) of the National army, the National army indeed has the superior condition of being able to defeat the Communist army's majority with a minority, and ultimately has the confidence to completely defeat the Communist army. As for the situation in Yangzhou, Director Yan analyzed it quite clearly: "In the northwestern suburbs of Yangzhou, the Communist army's closest area of activity, such as Yangjia Temple and Ganquan Mountain, is less than ten miles away from Yangzhou City, and its strength, although not very great, is three regiments. But why has it never dared to step beyond the thunder pool again? Because by doing that, it knows it won't gain anything good; absolutely nothing good! ... In a word: our rigorous and solid deployment prevents it from invading!"</p>
<p>The County Magistrate's Inspection Brings Peace of Mind</p>
<p>On the side of the county government, County Magistrate Zhang inspected Yiling Town, the center point of the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, on the 20th (in the eastern countryside of Yangzhou). If the county magistrate can run dozens of miles out of the urban area, why should the people in the urban area be uneasy? The "Second Plenary Session of the Provisional Council of Jiangdu County" started booming again in the "Zhongshan Memorial Hall" in the north of the city yesterday (the 25th). In addition to the heads of various agencies in Yangzhou County, Ling Shaozu, a provincial committee member, also came from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou to participate. This further diluted the atmosphere of the war that Yangzhou had faced a few days ago. The actions of this group of "social elites" in the "Provisional Council" have invisibly provided considerable spiritual support to the people.</p>
<p>As Solid as a Fortress, As Stable as a Rock</p>
<p>I heard that the situation in Zhenjiang, on the contrary, does not seem as calm as Yangzhou. This newspaper's special correspondent Hang Zhou, who came to Yangzhou City from Shanghai via Zhenjiang a few days ago, saw the market here: teahouses full of customers, shops on the street doing business as usual, and he said that to the reporter. The movement of Zhenjiang should depend on Yangzhou. Therefore, I mentioned one thing to Hang: When the situation in Taixing City was once unclear, several banks here inevitably felt a little panicked and urgently transported huge sums of money from their vaults to Zhenjiang, and some employees also sent their families to Zhenjiang. At that time, it had aroused the attention and disturbance of the people in Yangzhou City, but those few banks immediately received criticism from the people. Therefore, the "Jiangdu Daily" here on the 21st had a record of a conversation with Jiang Renyu, manager of the Yangzhou branch of the Central Bank, saying that "no matter how the environment changes in the future, the Central Bank will act in unison with the military and political authorities and will never evacuate on its own."</p>
<p>In short, regarding the security here, if we don't say "as solid as a fortress," we can also say "as stable as a rock."</p>
<p>The Epidemic of Cholera Causes Panic</p>
<p>However, in addition to the military situation being able to stabilize people's hearts, there are two things in Yangzhou that are extremely difficult to reassure people about. One thing is the epidemic of cholera. According to what I learned yesterday from meeting with Xu Ruihe, the head of the "Provincial Yangzhou Hospital," and Ye Shicheng, the head of the "Private Yangzhou Concord Hospital," Yangzhou has now become an area where cholera is spreading rapidly, with several people dying from this terrible disease every day. In daily life, I see that when people talk about this disease, they often "turn pale at the mention of the tiger." Also, at the banquet for reporters at the "Provisional Council" on the 24th, perhaps because of the deep understanding of the situation of the cholera epidemic, there was a phenomenon of not daring to eat such "cold dishes" and being afraid to touch dishes that easily attract flies, with a great sense of panic. As a result, a certain brother, a veteran reporter, was able to eat heartily and specially!</p>
<p>The Times Affect Commercial Decline</p>
<p>Another thing is the commercial depression. Yangzhou's commerce has been affected by the situation, and from last winter to this summer, it has been declining and depressed. The main phenomenon is that old customers from the surrounding villages and towns are rarely seen coming into the city to buy things. For example, the "Viewing Incense Market," which is usually bustling for a season, has quietly passed this year without a sound. Silk shops, southern goods stores... all have the sad scene of "mice running on the counter," as people say. Therefore, recently, many shops have closed. One situation is that expenses are large and income is small, and there is no way to maintain it any longer. The tax authorities continue to collect business taxes from the remaining shops that are still struggling to maintain their appearance but are actually on the verge of death. Therefore, on this day of the 21st, an organization called "Yangzhou Merchants' Welfare Mutual Aid Society" was created here, with the reason and hardship of "this county suffering severely during the enemy-puppet period, the period of stable order after victory being the latest, and now entering the military period, all industries are depressed..." This "Mutual Aid Society," representing all merchants and people of Yangzhou, will go to the province to request that the authorities exempt the business tax from November 34th to January 35th, and from May, June, and July of this year. They are prepared to pay the business tax for February, March, April of this year, but they request that the funds the government borrowed from Yangzhou merchants in the past be returned. I have a few opinions on this matter: I hope that the government, following the virtuous policy of exempting land taxes, can show more consideration for Yangzhou's commerce, which has suffered disasters repeatedly! Otherwise, according to my understanding, the shops here will likely close down completely. If that happens, it will greatly affect the security of Yangzhou and the stability of the people's hearts.</p>

<h3>Peaceful Xi'an</h3>
<p>— This newspaper's Twenty-Fifth of the Month Xi'an Dispatch, Special Correspondent Li Chi</p>
<p>The flames of war in the Central Plains finally spread to the borders of Shaanxi on the 20th of this month. Without a doubt, this news is receiving close attention from all parties here. The airplanes flying back and forth over the southeastern corner of the clear sky seem to be more frequent than usual. The blue sky, which has been silent for almost a year, seems to be agitated again.</p>
<p>Li Xiannian's communist forces, between southern Henan and northern Hubei, have been clearly moving westward in the past month and a half. The boundary lines between the provincial governments of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi are artificially political divisions. There are no high mountains or great rivers as natural divisions. Within Shaanxi, the Qinling Mountains (namely Zhongnan Mountain) and the Funiu Mountains in Henan, or rather, the Han River Valley in southern Shaanxi and northern Hubei, is a continuous low-lying area connecting the three provinces. When observing news on this front, this point should be noted. However, no matter what, from the perspective of people living in Shaanxi, the sound of gunfire within the province always feels like a direct injury, which is a common sentiment of people who love their homeland. What the common people pray for day and night is a peaceful territory and a prosperous populace!</p>
<p>Traveling southeast from Xi'an along the highway, crossing the Qinling Mountains, including the famous "Snow blocks the Lan Pass, horses cannot advance" Lan Pass, one reaches Shang County, Longjuzhai, and Shangnan, and then enters Henan at Jingziguan and Zhechuan, and further south, one reaches Laohekou in Hubei. This is an old road and highway connecting the three provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei. In recent days, the place names along the southern section of the route have successively appeared in official announcements in the telegraph. The westernmost point of Li Xiannian's forces, according to official reports, is near Longjuzhai. Measuring the straight-line distance on the map, it is approximately two hundred li southeast of Xi'an. However, there is the high and dangerous Qinling Mountains separating them, like a row of barriers. Therefore, this distance is not very meaningful. Xi'an is currently very stable, and the market situation is as usual.</p>
<p>The "Military Mediation Department" has dispatched the 32nd Executive Group, consisting of six people, to mediate and handle the military affairs in this area. They departed from Laohekou and arrived in Longjuzhai on the 20th. The list includes the government representatives Major General Wang Kaiting and Lieutenant Colonel Shi Xizhi, the communist representatives Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shicun and Major Shi Gu, and the American representatives Lieutenant Colonel Bai Luosuo and Captain He Lumai. Lieutenant Colonel Bai fell ill on the way and should have rested, but due to his strong sense of responsibility, he persevered. The group has invited Li Xiannian himself or sent a representative to Longjuzhai for consultation. The group of six is scheduled to take the road through Shang County to Xi'an on the 24th, and the officials here have prepared a welcome. "Turn hostility into friendship," that is what the common people are praying for.</p>
<p>Shang County, Longjuzhai, and Shangnan belong to the Fourth Administrative Commissioner District of this province. In this district, near the mountainous areas in southern (north of Longjuzhai) and southern slope (south of Longjuzhai) and Shang County, there has been news in the past ten days that security is lacking, with large gangs and some scattered bandits appearing. They are well-equipped, and Chen Zhuokan, the commissioner and commander-in-chief of the Fourth District, is setting a deadline for clearing them. Whether this group of people is purely brigands or rebels, and whether they have any connection with Li Xiannian's forces, is worth pondering. Exploring from the perspectives of time and location, it seems quite difficult to be such a "coincidence."</p>
<p>In the past, a lot of goods were transported into Shaanxi via this highway. But since the Longhai Railway became smooth, the amount of goods transported via this highway has been decreasing as the railway freight rates are cheaper than the highway freight rates. Therefore, although there is gunfire in the southeastern corner of Shaanxi, there are no signs of direct impact on the market. Whether in finance or prices, everything remains stable, which is an indicator of the stability of people's hearts.</p>
<p>The past few days have been relatively sultry, perhaps the hottest days of this summer. Yesterday afternoon, a sudden rainstorm with thunder and lightning damaged many electric poles and trees. After about eighty or ninety minutes of violence, the sky cleared, and the evening sun was still so bright. I couldn't help but think of Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" last two movements: the sound of the flute is clearer after the rumble of thunder, and the common people thank God for regaining peace.</p>

<h3>Responding to Readers, Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Shi Weiying asks (1) The Student Economic Canteen organized by the Shanghai Student Relief Committee provides two meals a day, each meal consisting of a piece of bread, a little jam, and a glass of milk made from milk powder. Is this sufficient for the daily nutritional needs of an adult? What kind of vitamins is this meal lacking? What kind of food should be added? (2) What is the best way to treat anemia quickly? (3) After suffering from scabies, I mistakenly applied carbolic acid solution, resulting in black scars that have not disappeared for a long time. What can I do to remove the black scars?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD] (1) An adult needs an average of about 2,400 calories per month from food. According to your description, it is far from this standard. An adult should consume 10 to 15 taels of grains, 1 catty of vegetables, including root vegetables for about a quarter, 3 to 6 taels of beans, 2 to 3 taels of animal and vegetable oil, and it would be even better to have 2 to 3 taels of fish and meat. (2) For anemia, eat more liver. (3) Wait for it to fade on its own. (2) Zhou Liwo asks: My feet are swollen in hot weather, and the swelling moves upward. There is no pain, but sometimes I feel numb. When I press with my finger, there is a dent that takes a long time to disappear. The swelling subsides slightly in the morning, and the swelling is severe in the autumn. What is this disease? What medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD] This is beriberi. Eat more beans. You can also inject vitamin B1.</p>
<p>(3) Yu Ziying asks: I am over fifty years old. I have suffered from headaches on the left side of my head since I was in my twenties. I have consulted at Renji, Guangren and other hospitals and prescribed light red medicine, which comes and goes. It often occurs when I am in a bad mood, or angry, or after reading a lot of books and writing a lot of articles. It has been over twenty years. In the past ten years, I have often taken headache powder to relieve the pain, but it still happens once or twice a month. I would be very grateful if you could tell me how to cure it.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD] The disease is called migraine, which is related to abnormal personality. You should be less angry and depressed. There is no cure.</p>
<h3>A Lung Disease Patient Requests Drugstores to Reduce Fees</h3>
<p>Singing praises to the benevolent act of Xinfu Pharmacy</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I read in your column that Xinfu Chinese Pharmacy is offering 10,000 free prescriptions to sick families. Their enthusiasm for helping the poor is admirable. I have suffered from lung disease for many years and have spent a great deal of money on medicine and injections. Since your newspaper reprinted the proven prescription for lung disease from Shaanxi, I bought and took it. I have taken over seventy doses, and the situation is still good. I can now work as usual. During this period, I have also asked various Chinese pharmacies to reduce their prices, because it is a commonly used prescription, and they should consider the patients, but I have not been able to get what I wanted. Now Xinfu Pharmacy is considerate of the poor and sick and is giving away 10,000 doses. If other Chinese pharmacies follow suit and consider the cost, reducing or waiving fees, the benefits to the poor and sick will be significant. Please publish this letter in your newspaper so that it can be a call to those with lung disease who cannot afford treatment. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Yan Renfu</p>
<h3>Soil Wells and Stinking Ponds Should Be Filled Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>So that germs have nowhere to parasitize</p>
<p>Dear Editor: The summer is hot, and the scorching sun is rampant. Epidemics and typhoid fever are bound to occur at any time. However, timely prevention is the best policy. The soil wells in the city's alleys and the stinking rivers and ponds in the suburbs are the source of germs. If you want to prevent epidemics, the fundamental plan is to fill them within a time limit. I implore your newspaper to publish a grand theory and urge the municipal authorities to pay close attention to it, which will benefit the world. Sincerely, Sun Yibin</p>
<h3>Explanation of Defatted Milk Powder</h3>
<p>Students of all schools must pay attention</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: I recently read in your column on the 14th of this month the reply from the Relief Administration explaining the quality of milk powder, which stated that "this milk powder is not suitable for direct consumption and must be prepared. For methods, please refer to the instructions for defatted milk powder issued by this office." When the Relief Administration distributed the powder, it did not attach the "Instructions for Defatted Powder" to be posted to students, and the newspapers did not have instructions on how to drink it, so most students did not understand it and still prepared it according to the method for whole milk powder. I hope your column can find a way to publicize the method of consumption, which I would be very grateful for. Sincerely, Liu Jiancheng, Social Service Department, Shen Bao Editorial Department</p>
<p>[Appendix] Instructions for the defatted milk powder distributed by the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Administration of the Relief Administration: (1) Nutritional value: Defatted milk powder is made by removing the cream and water from milk. Two taels of milk powder can make sixteen taels (two measuring cups) or one pint of milk, which can provide one-fifth of the daily caloric needs of a five-year-old child, one-half of the required protein, two times the required calcium, one-quarter of the required vitamin B1, and the required amount of lactofen. (2) Storage: Milk powder is easily clotted when exposed to air, so it must be stored in a tightly covered container in a cool, dry place. (3) Milk making method: 1.

<h3>The Twists and Turns of the Ever-Changing European Peace Conference</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>The European Peace Conference, long awaited by everyone, opened in Paris yesterday. The convening of the conference and the signing of the treaties are, on the one hand, a settlement of the war, and on the other hand, a foundation for future peace. Due to the vast scope of this Second World War and the complexity of post-war problems, the conference is divided into three parts: one for the five countries of Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland; one for Germany; and one for Japan. This conference is the prelude to the peace conference, and the main issue is only to discuss the peace treaties with the five countries of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, but it can also be said to be paving the way for future peace treaties with Germany and Japan. We see that the convening of this conference has gone through many twists and turns beforehand, showing how difficult it is to seek lasting peace.</p>
<p>The collapse of Germany and the surrender of Japan ended the conflict of artillery fire on the battlefield and shifted it to negotiations between envoys. In the Potsdam Conference, there was a resolution to establish a meeting of the five foreign ministers to discuss post-war peace treaties. However, the Five Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in London in August 1945 ended in discord after twenty days of effort. In December, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union met again in Moscow, attempting to break the deadlock, and decided that only member states that had signed the surrender document could participate in drafting the peace treaties with the five countries, that is, the peace treaty with Italy would be drafted by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France; the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary would be drafted by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and the peace treaty with Finland would be drafted by Britain and the Soviet Union. Once the draft treaties were prepared, a peace conference would be held by the five member states participating in the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the sixteen countries in the United Nations that had made actual military contributions in resisting European enemy countries for final discussion. The conference was scheduled to be held on May 1 this year.</p>
<p>According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, representatives of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France were ordered to draft peace treaties with the five countries separately in London. The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference was then held in Paris on April 25.</p>
<p>The Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference opened on April 25 and adjourned on May 15. After more than twenty days of discussion, although some minor issues had been agreed upon, many major issues remained unresolved and deadlocked.</p>
<p>(1) The Trieste Issue: The Soviet Union proposed that the Istrian Peninsula should be划歸 Yugoslavia. The United States advocated that Trieste should belong to Italy. France proposed a compromise solution of international co-management. Britain and the United States had agreed, but the Soviet Union insisted on not yielding, resulting in a pending issue.</p>
<p>(2) The Dodecanese Islands Issue: Britain agreed to return the islands to Greece, but the Soviet Union believed that this was one of Italy's colonies and should be discussed together with the Italian colonies.</p>
<p>(3) The Italian Border Issue: France and Austria both had disputes with Italy over territory. Part of Upper Adige had been decided to be retained by Italy. As for the areas of Tende and Briga requested by France, a decision would be made after a fact-finding mission.</p>
<p>(4) The Italian Colonial Issue: The Soviet Union requested sole trusteeship of Tripoli, while Britain advocated complete independence. France proposed that it should still be entrusted to Italy under the name of the United Nations. The United States also suggested adopting an international trusteeship system. Subsequently, the United States and the Soviet Union also agreed to France's proposal, but Britain insisted on using trusteeship of Cyrenaica as an exchange condition, which led to a deadlock.</p>
<p>(5) The Italian Reparations Issue: The Soviet Union demanded that Italy pay reparations of 300 million US dollars to the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. Britain and the United States both believed that this would hinder Italy's recovery. As a result, the United States proposed that only three-quarters of the 100 million US dollars under the Soviet Union's name should be paid. However, the Soviet Union refused to accept.</p>
<p>(6) The Danube Navigation Issue: The United States requested the opening of the Danube, and Britain suggested international co-management, but the Soviet Union believed that all countries along the Danube had the necessity to participate in the discussion, so it refused to negotiate.</p>
<p>Since these many important issues could not be resolved, a layer of gray smoke shrouded European peace. The conference was originally scheduled to be convened on June 15, but the Soviet Union insisted that it could not be convened before the drafting of the peace treaties with the five countries was resolved. As a result, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference decided to postpone it and reconvene one month later. In a dark situation, this revealed a glimmer of light.</p>
<p>After a month's adjournment, the four foreign ministers met again in Paris on June 15. This meeting was the key to maintaining European peace, and all countries attached great importance to it. However, the attitudes of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union had not changed. In his broadcast speech after the meeting, Byrnes emphasized the firm policy of the United States, but Molotov said that the policy adopted by Britain and the United States was how to deal with the Soviet Union, not to maintain world peace. Many people were therefore worried about the future of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Trieste dispute, the Soviet Union still supported Yugoslavia's demands. Italy's attitude was more moderate, willing to accept international mediation to resolve it in a fair and reasonable manner, but believed that Wilson's method was generally reasonable, that is, to leave Trieste to Italy. Subsequently, the Soviet Union agreed to the plan for the internationalization of Trieste proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, but the designated area was pitifully small and surrounded by Yugoslavia, so Britain and the United States could not agree. Bidault then proposed a compromise solution, dividing it according to the border drawn by France, with the east belonging to Yugoslavia and the west belonging to Italy, while expanding the internationalized area of Trieste. The Trieste issue was then reluctantly resolved.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Italy's reparations, the United States had agreed to the Soviet Union's demand for 100 million US dollars in reparations, but offset it with two of Italy's luxurious cruise ships, so as to avoid hindering Italy's livelihood. At this point, the Soviet Union slightly conceded, expressing its willingness to accept the US proposal. As for the 200 million US dollars demanded for reparations to Greece, Yugoslavia, and Albania, it was submitted to the peace conference for discussion.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Italy's colonies, the Soviet Union, in order to extend its influence in the Mediterranean, requested sole trusteeship of Tripoli. Britain was unwilling to easily give up the land it had already occupied in North Africa. In this meeting, a strategy of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial was adopted, and it was decided that Italy should relinquish its rights to its African colonies. The four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union would then decide the legal status of these colonies within one year. If a solution could not be agreed upon within one year, the issue would be submitted to the United Nations for handling.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the navigation of the Danube, the four countries had recognized that for the sake of world peace and world trade, the Danube and its navigable tributaries and canals should be freely opened to all countries under conditions of complete equality.</p>
<p>Other issues, such as the disposal of the remaining Italian fleet and the issue of British and American troops in Italy and Soviet troops in Bulgaria, were also agreed upon. The Italian issue had been largely resolved, and there was not much difficulty in drafting the peace treaty. The conference was decided to be held in Paris on July 29, and all unresolved issues would be discussed at the conference.</p>
<p>Although the date of the European Peace Conference had been decided, there were still considerable twists and turns before the invitations were issued: one was the issue of inviting countries, and the other was the issue of conference procedures. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov firmly insisted that China should not be an inviting country to the conference, but only an invited country. US Secretary of State Byrnes immediately refuted this, believing that it was an insult to China. Our Foreign Minister Wang also issued a solemn statement. Britain and the United States had once accepted the Soviet Union's proposal, but as a result, under the pressure of public opinion in various countries, the Soviet Union abandoned its stubborn attitude and recognized China as one of the members of the presidium of the conference. The conference was convened in the name of the Five Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. There was also a dispute over the procedures of the conference. The Soviet Union advocated that the conference procedures should be decided by the four powers and issued together with the invitations. However, Britain and the United States firmly stated that the conference procedures should be finally decided by the plenary session of the 21 countries. As a result, a compromise solution was adopted, with the Foreign Ministers' Conference deciding several principles to be sent to the participating countries in the form of suggestions for their adoption. The French government, in its capacity as the host country, represented the five countries and issued invitations on July 9. The many twists and turns in convening the conference finally came to an end.</p>
<p>The 21-nation European Peace Conference, convened after so many difficulties, has finally been realized today. It is hoped that satisfactory results can be obtained at the conference. This is not only the wish of the foreign ministers involved in the negotiations, but also the wish of people all over the world.</p>

<h3>The Story of This Night</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lixing</p>
<p>—Written in Commemoration of the Great Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart—</p>
<p>"Beethoven is great, but, but our Mozart! Mozart is simply the only great musician in ancient and modern times!" This is what the Italian musician Rossini, one of the world's famous composers, wrote on the last blank page of a volume of Mozart's posthumous works after discovering it. It clearly showed the postscript of the great musician Mozart, who was unprecedented and unparalleled at the time. Therefore, he suddenly realized that this little poem was also inspired by a kind of noble sympathy and stimulated pure altruistic spirit, coupled with his natural talent, and finally wrote that page. Therefore, he—Rossini—was even more certain that Mozart's writings could be said to have exceeded the scope of musical art. Strictly speaking, it was not music, but completely and unreservedly "poetry." This poem is like this, and so are all the posthumous sounds he left us.</p>
<p>The page with the postscript that Rossini discovered was the only miracle in Rossini's life, so it is no wonder that Rossini shed many tears. Later, Rossini felt that being able to admire Mozart's own handwriting was an enlightenment given and encouraged by God to him to admire the sages. Then he spent two years and eight months of hard work and experience, writing the world-famous grand opera (Opera: William Tell) to repay the great kindness of God for creating Mozart and leaving his legacy immortal for all ages.</p>
<p>This poem is (Serenade: Eine Kleine Nachtmusik), a little serenade for this night. After the four-beat sonata, the great composer, our Mozart, wrote the following postscript:</p>
<p>"After the bright moon is smeared by a black cloud, the shadow of the paulownia tree appears particularly clear, but when the light of the bright moon is covered, who can think of the loneliness of the paulownia tree and the souls of all living things in the world that are covered by darkness! Therefore, because of the hasty draft in my mind, I wrote the music score messily with a stone pen. This is a Serenade, divided into four sections. When I hurriedly finished playing it with a triangle piano, the bright moonlight had climbed to the other side of the treetop, and I began to feel drowsy.</p>
<p>"When I looked up, in this quiet universe, the masses of living beings could not see who was encountering the breath of sorrow and anger. The branches swayed in the wind, and the late flowers brought a cold fragrance. I thought I was the most soulful person among living beings, and I felt how lovely life was. God created us, and we have also created everything in the world. This tree, that pile of flowers, were all watered and cultivated by me five years ago to this day. Sure enough, they have also shared the breath of living things in the world for five years. Thinking of this, I opened my Serenade again from my drowsy eyes, and slowly opened the triangle piano, taking advantage of the fact that it was in this world full of "love" when I thought it must be modified, to make it a more perfect poem.</p>
<p>"After the song was finished, the moonlight slanted westward, and there was no one around. In the silence, there was inevitably some loneliness. In the caressing of the breeze, I turned back and looked at the north corner under the paulownia tree. A woman in plain clothes was standing facing the moonlight. I don't know when she approached here. Looking at her, she slowly moved towards me, holding a cloth hat in both hands to wipe her eyes. A faint sound of sobbing came from the wind. When she approached me, I found that she was an old lady in her seventies. Slowly, she put down her hands and seemed to involuntarily rush towards me. She tightly held my arms with her hands, raised her head, and tears fell like raindrops. I already understood that this must not be a sudden encounter. I already felt as if I must use the most sincere feelings to comfort everything she wanted to pour out to me.</p>
<p>"Good child! God, where did you come from! How did you completely play out everything I wanted to the world! Child, listen to me tell a short story, and then insert some of it into your song," the old lady said slowly, holding my arms tightly with both hands.</p>
<p>"Last night, I had just returned home from Italy. It had been almost thirty years since I separated from it. After I received the news of my son's death in battle, I could no longer stay here. So I wandered to Italy. On the night before I left home, because of my reluctance, I hummed the silhouette of my husband and mourned my son's sacrifice for the country here with sobbing sounds. At that time, I vaguely remembered that the tune I hummed was just like the one you just played, but, child! Thirty years ago, were you already listening to my son? I think, at that time, you might not have been born yet!"</p>
<p>"I tell you, my dear child, I am already seventy-four years old this year. I have been living in my lovely but more heartbreaking homeland for forty-four years, thirty years away from it. When I left here thirty years ago, only the bright moon was the same as it was outside, and everything else had changed. But I remember, I will always remember, and I have remembered it in my heart for nearly sixty years, that is, before I gave birth to my son who died for the country, there was also a paulownia tree here, and there was also a pile of peony flowers over there. However, for nearly sixty years, I have gained the reality of despair from hope. Ah! Those elusive fifty-eight years!" She had already turned her sobbing into a desperate smile, but I shed tears.</p>
<p>"Fifty-eight years ago, I was a sixteen-year-old child. To this day, I still remember the night as bright as tonight. My husband, who had only been married for four days, took my hand and walked under such a paulownia tree. I snuggled against his chin, and we both sat down here. He asked me to follow and hum the poem he sang from his mouth, singing and harmonizing to add so much activity to this world, but, ah, my child, fifty-eight years ago, where were you! What you just played was indeed stolen from us at that time, with only a little bit missing. However, what we didn't sing at the time, you have now put it in. Ah, God, are there really such strange things in the world?" The old lady said to me kindly with strange eyes:</p>
<p>"From that night, it seemed that the war between the enemy and us was really unavoidable, but unexpectedly, on the morning of the third day, my twenty-year-old husband, who had only been married for a week, put on his military uniform and went on an expedition. From then on, when the bright moon came every day, I walked slowly here alone, humming this tune in my mouth, and praying to God for protection, hoping that he would return home with glory as soon as possible. I hoped, I hoped like this every night for fifty-eight years. In such a long time, I still taught my son to hum the tune sung by his father, whom he had never met, continuing the second war to die for the country. My son was a posthumous child, but I still hope to this day that his father can return with gray hair and spirit, because I still don't believe he won't return. But, my son has indeed died in battle. Ah! My young and handsome husband, I still don't know where he lives."</p>
<p>"On the eve of my husband's expedition, he and I still came to this paulownia tree and hummed this tune. He told me that life is limited, but art will last forever. If I die for the country one day, you—that is me—you might as well hum this tune every night under the bright moon, hoping that I will return with glory. If I don't return in one day, I will always return in one month. If I don't return in one month, I will always return in one year. If I don't return in one year, I will always return in ten years. If I don't return in ten years, then twenty years, thirty years, forty years, fifty years... I will always return in ten thousand years, so you might as well always hum this tune in hope, hoping that I will return. But, ah! Today, my good child, fifty-eight years have passed like flowing water, and the son who grew up to be twenty-three years old has also gone. Who can believe that the two fathers and sons can return together! But, my child! I have been full of hope in these long fifty-eight years until today, waiting for my husband, my son to return suddenly, but before they return, your serenade has extended my hope for another fifty-eight years. Ah, my child, how limited life is! Please set it up, will they still come back, you say?" As she said this, tears had already choked her throat. I couldn't bear to listen any longer, but, but I decided to insert this tragic encounter into this story of hers fifty-eight years ago.</p>
<p>"From this night, I didn't eat for two days and didn't sleep peacefully for two nights. I used my greatest enthusiasm and effort to write this chapter of Serenade into a completely sad narrative. At the same time, in the last section, I still properly arranged "hope" for her. For more than a month, every night, I always took this triangle piano and helped this old lady to the paulownia tree that I planted with my own hands to play this story, and when I played to the last section of "hope," I played it again and again until she felt that it was possible to reunite with them after waiting another fifty-eight years, and then I made her happily go home to sleep. However, today she passed away without any illness.</p>
<p>"Life is limited, but for fifty-eight years, she always spent this time like flowing water in "hope." Fifty-eight years cannot be considered short, and "hope" is ultimately immortal. This is what I recorded in this chapter of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Serenade."</p>
<p>Author's note: This article was written in French and published in Paris, International Music Quarterly, September issue, 1939. After the war, because there were no books on hand, I slightly combined what I remembered in the past to make a chapter. The translator and author are the same person, so there should not be much discrepancy. It must be certified. In addition, 85% of the original manuscript written in French is based on (1) Rossini's Opera (Lyon Conservatory 1902 edition, French version) (2) Beethoven's Biography (Paris Museum 1910 edition, Romain Rolland's original work, French version) (3) Goethe's Letters (Cologne Germanic Academy 1907 edition, French translation), etc. It is attached for identification.</p>

<h3>Writing and Life</h3>
<p>— Fang Wuzhi</p>
<p>In the latest Volume Two, Issue Two of "The Youth World," I saw Mr. Zhao Jingshen's "On Writing," which included the sentence, "Don't write about what you don't know." I believe this sentence should be the motto of every novice writer. Because any masterpiece in the world is written with material that the author is very familiar with, such as Fadeyev's "The Rout" and Chekhov's "Ward No. 6." The background of every story is something they are familiar with. With familiar material, combined with genius organization and description, they can produce those vivid things. In other words: it is because of their authoritative genius, coupled with the special skill of describing the bottom line.</p>
<p>A writer who grows up in the international city of Shanghai, if he wants to write about the scenery of Bashan and Shushui, or the lives of the people of Yunnan and Guizhou, no matter how much he racks his brains and wears out thousands of pens, he will not be able to write in a decent manner. Even if he succeeds in a work, it will never be as vivid or moving as the real thing! Thus, if a writer wants to write about something he didn't know before, the only possibility is to personally experience the life in the environment he wants to describe, and deliberately throw himself into a certain embrace for detailed research. Therefore, this is the issue of "Writing and Life" that we want to discuss.</p>
<p>A literary worker, in order to open up a literary path, and in order to create his own brand-new works, must enrich his experience, focus on studying reality, and pay attention to daily life. Only by combining his own real life and writing about the struggle literature with the unique style of the class he stands in, can he always succeed. If a novice writer, after just writing a few stories or a few poems, regards himself as a cultured person and wants to break away from his original living environment to live a monotonous cultural life, it proves that he completely does not understand the meaning of "literary writing should be combined with real life" and will never succeed. Many young literary friends today are abandoning the path of writing because they hold this view and often break away from real life. Know that a literary worker must not despise his own position, because the more adverse the environment, the more real the writing material, and beautiful and great works can be written in the fields and in the mines.</p>
<p>In short, a literary worker should constantly learn and observe the environment in his work, and hunt for the most familiar and typical writing material in the environment. Engels once said: "Creation and the style of a writer, according to my observation, so-called realism, is precise description, and the extraction of real stories from the real environment. Apart from that, it is the description of real life, expressing typical characters in a typical environment..."</p>
<p>Now there is a very popular saying in our society, that is, when we talk about a certain spiritual victor, we always compare him to Ah Q. Because Ah Q is a typical spiritual victor known to everyone, of course, when we talk about this kind of person, only comparing him with Ah Q is the most appropriate. But you must know why this is the case? Because Mr. Lu Xun observed reality and conformed to real life, he observed many similar personalities, and then he created a literary type.</p>
<h3>The Storyteller</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The storyteller, with a small rectangular striking wood, relying on a glib tongue, a mouth that speaks endlessly, tirelessly opens his deep talk box like a Yellow River breach among many dazed people.</p>
<p>It is rare to see him clean up his head of hair, it is always so disheveled. Under his two sparse eyebrows, a pair of dim and lifeless eyes hides infinite melancholy in his heart. Is he habitually using his unrestrained and rushing mouth to reveal all the melancholy in his heart?</p>
<p>He is an unruly idler, but also a patriot who cares about the people. He sings loudly among the vast, dazed crowd; he calls out; he also points out and pleads among the vast, dazed crowd. He sings loudly about what is worthy of praise in this crowd; he calls out what the crowd should be calling out; he points out the road that this crowd should take; he also laments what makes this crowd sad. He also uses his rectangular striking wood, which always accompanies him, to strike hard at the heads of the generally dazed people.</p>
<p>But the crowd is so stubborn and unrepentant, their dazedness is destined for their mediocre fate. They just open their eyes wide, prick up their ears, and watch and listen to the storyteller's moving actions and pleasant voice aimlessly, without feeling, from his youth until they see his hair turn gray and his voice become hoarse. They listen to the storyteller's stories. The storyteller strikes the table with the striking wood and says with emotion:</p>
<p>"Yue Fei was loyal to the country, but was killed by the old cunning Qin Hui with the trumped-up charge of 'perhaps'..."</p>
<p>Then the vast crowd lets out a slight sigh of indifference. They watch the storyteller's acting. The storyteller uses all his strength to turn his face red, imitating Wu Song's roar when he fought the tiger, and then jumps up and down repeatedly. Then the vast crowd laughs, laughing strangely; they even say he is a clown.</p>
<p>Then the storyteller becomes melancholy, and he regrets that this crowd is incorrigible. The withering of life adds even more melancholy to his heart. But he is helpless. In order to prolong his own withered remaining years, he continues to spin around among the vast and dazed crowd with his small striking wood and his already hoarse voice. But in the end, he finally collapses from exhaustion, but not a single one of the people who have ever listened to or seen him feels sorry for him, because they are still so dazed!</p>
<h3>Music Circle</h3>
<p>— Xiting</p>
<p>Shanghai only has one music publication, "Music Magazine." In the past, it was affected by square-shaped publications and could not be sold. We hope that this magazine, the only one in Shanghai that advocates pure music, can sell well.</p>
<p>"Dance Hall Music" affects the general public's ability to appreciate music. How this issue should be handled will be discussed at a symposium to be held by the Music Association recently.</p>

<h3>A Silver Needle Bangle</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Xing</p>
<p>——Experiences and anecdotes of child psychology——</p>
<p>When I was nine years old, I met a girl who lived across the street. She was visiting her grandmother. Because I met her, my entire universe changed. I was very shy. When I saw her golden hair and rosy face, I was stunned. And those attitudes that were half gentle and half solemn, although they made me uneasy, I couldn't bear to leave. Soon I knew that she was going back to her distant hometown, perhaps never to return.</p>
<p>But between us, there was an absolute need for something to serve as a permanent chain of friendship. So I went to the store to find a perfect gift. In the store, I found an eye-catching silver needle bangle with exquisite patterns engraved on it. Such a thing would be a perfect gift, but its price was quite expensive, not something I could easily afford.</p>
<p>But I had to get it. So I had no choice but to go to my parents tremblingly and say, "Dad, I need fifty cents to buy something important—but I can't tell you what I'm buying, but I think it's very proper and very important."</p>
<p>If he were to force me to say what I was buying, it would be tantamount to pronouncing my death sentence.</p>
<p>My father was the pastor of the parish. In reality, the pastor's child had never even seen fifty cents. But my father listened to my request and stared at me, and finally said, "Child, you go to the study first, and let me and your mother discuss it." Soon he came to the study, gave me fifty cents, and gently patted my shoulder, without saying a word.</p>
<p>So I bought that moving object, put it in a white box, secretly took my father's stationery, and laboriously pieced together a few lines:</p>
<p>"Dear Na Su:</p>
<p>I will definitely miss you very much when we are apart. Please come again! Love, little John"</p>
<p>I placed the gift on the carpet in front of the door across the street. Taking advantage of the fact that no one was watching, I rang the doorbell and fled in a panic.</p>
<p>I got up very early the next morning and intercepted the mailman halfway. Strangely enough, there was indeed a letter addressed to me. I climbed to the top branch of the apple tree and secretly tore it open to read this reply.</p>
<p>"Friend:</p>
<p>Thank you for the beautiful gift. I hope I can come back next summer.</p>
<p>Then I can meet you. Sincerely, Na Su"</p>
<p>Using the words "friend" and "sincerely" to reply to my expensive gift made me a little disappointed. I hid the letter in the porch, preparing to read it repeatedly, but soon my father moved to another parish, and from then on, I never heard from Na Su again.</p>
<p>The facts of the matter—my parents never asked about the purpose of my money. They gently passed through the critical moment. According to my family rules and training, which were strict by modern standards, they still respected my individuality. When I said that my need was important and secret, they accepted my request. My parents trusted me, which made me believe that they would help me with everything that was important to me. If they had refused, unless it was a solemn opinion—there would inevitably be a gap between father and son. I cringe when I hear parents criticize their children for their very childish love affairs or other things that adults find ridiculous. If you recognize your children as "people," with real problems and understanding, the children will naturally feel it and naturally reach the parents' expectations.</p>
<p>Childhood is the beginning of adulthood. Pride, ignorance, bias, irritability, and selfishness should all be suppressed. Children confide their emotions and difficulties to their parents. Parents should not ridicule them, let alone ignore them, because this is precisely the child seeking help in the vast universe.</p>
<h3>Is Abstinence Harmful?</h3>
<p>— Yan Juan</p>
<p>(1) The Difficulty of Abstinence</p>
<p>The sexologist Kraft-Ebing once said:</p>
<p>"Women's desire for love is stronger than men's. The only way to satisfy this desire for love properly is marriage. However, in the complex modern life, marriage has become a difficult problem, so the marriage rate is gradually decreasing, and the age of marriage is also getting later. On the men's side, sexual problems are easier to solve in this society, but on the women's side, they have to be suppressed, so they are prone to hysteria. Elderly virgins often age early, which is caused by the inability to satisfy sexual impulses. This problem cannot be solved except by marriage."</p>
<p>These few simple sentences of Ebing's are full of endless thoughts. Even if we cannot unconditionally and completely agree, suppressing sexual desire is indeed the most difficult thing, and no one can avoid this feeling.</p>
<p>(2) Abstinence and Nerves</p>
<p>It has become common sense that abstinence is harmful to the body after a certain age. But Schopenhauer once said:</p>
<p>"Sexual relations are not necessary for your health. If you have absolutely no sexual behavior from birth to old age, then your health will not be harmed."</p>
<p>If, like a great man, you hold a firm belief and live an absolutely abstinent life, then it will not only not harm your health, but will also have a good influence. But if you don't have a firm belief, and you have to abstain after living a married life, then the result of the common sense mentioned above will occur.</p>
<p>Lewin Falt has the following statistical report:</p>
<p>"For men aged twenty-four or five, there is no harm in starting absolute abstinence. For men aged twenty-five to thirty-six, if they have been married and abstain, then strong people will exhibit neurotic symptoms, such as irritability, sexual hyperactivity, aversion to work, and mild dizziness. Nervous people will develop depression, melancholia, etc. On the women's side, although they can tolerate abstinence better than men after marriage, many nervous people will also develop hysteria, neurasthenia, etc."</p>
<p>Due to abstinence, the intense sexual impulses are suppressed, causing the central nervous system to become fatigued and even hypersensitive, thus affecting health.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the period when sexual impulses are extremely weak, or for those who have not experienced intense impulses, an abstinent life is not harmful. If the intense sexual impulses are suppressed for a long time, it will definitely make the central nervous system extremely fatigued, and when an accidental cause is encountered, symptoms of neurosis will occur; moreover, because of long-term mental tension, it will often turn into a narrow personality. However, for people with strong constitutions and nervous systems, it will not cause any harm. Therefore, whether an abstinent life is harmful or not depends mostly on the strength of each person's innate nervous system.</p>

<h3>How to Make Many Fortune Cakes?</h3>
<p>— Mu Mei</p>
<p>If you have a daughter studying at school, you have probably received a ration of milk powder recently, right? But the rationed milk powder you received is very coarse in quality. If you brew it and drink it, it is not only unpleasant in taste, but also has sediment. Your children probably don't like to drink it, right? So how do you dispose of this milk powder?</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here is using this milk powder to make a kind of snack called "Many Fortune Cakes." What are "Many Fortune Cakes"? If you have a strong memory, you may still remember that you could buy ten of those circle-shaped snacks for one yuan in the basement of the Great World Company many years ago, right? These are called "Many Fortune Cakes." Originally, this kind of snack used flour as the main ingredient and was mixed with milk. Now, milk powder is used to save on milk.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Twelve ounces of milk powder, four ounces of flour, four ounces of white sugar. (You can add more if you like sweets.) One small teaspoon of baking soda, two raw chicken eggs, half a catty of raw oil.</p>
<p>Method: Except for pouring half a catty of raw oil into the pot to prepare for cooking, first break the chicken eggs, and mix them into the above ingredients, making sure that the milk powder, sugar, and other things are thoroughly mixed. If the egg juice and sugar juice are not enough to moisten the milk powder, you can add half a tablespoon of raw oil. If it is still not enough, you can add a little water, but it should not be too wet. Generally, mix it until it is like the kind used for making noodles. After mixing, pick it into pieces the size of longan, and then rub the pieces into thin strips, about three inches long, and put the two ends together to form a circle. Put the made circles one by one on a plate to prevent sticking. First, sprinkle a layer of dry flour on the bottom of the plate. At that time, you can start a fire to cook the oil. Wait until the oil is thoroughly boiled, and then you can gradually put the made circles into the oil pan to fry. When you see them slightly yellow, use chopsticks to pick them up. This is homemade Many Fortune Cakes. Eating them while they are hot is fragrant, crispy, and nutritious and hygienic. Moreover, it doesn't cost much money! If you make more, you can put them in a cookie box or a glass jar to prevent moisture and store them for many days. I think, instead of giving money to your children on such a hot day and letting them go outside to buy unclean cold drinks or snacks to eat, which may lead to seasonal epidemics, it is better for you to work hard and make some Many Fortune Cakes for them to eat.</p>

<h3>Black Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Blue Danube is sentimental, while the Black Suzhou Creek is shameful. The Danube produced musicians and poets, while the Suzhou Creek evokes feelings of revulsion.</p>
<p>I walk past the Suzhou Creek every day. I dare not look down at the dark, turbid stream. I look up at the sky, which is high and clear, with distinct blue and white colors. But the stench emanating from this thirsty stream rushes straight into my nostrils, like the foul and fishy breath spewed from the mouth of a venomous python, haunting you, the nearly four million citizens of Shanghai, like a ghost. You live in that kind of atmosphere every day.</p>
<p>If we use the human body as an analogy, this is a festering appendix that can endanger a person's life.</p>
<p>It seems like an incomprehensible myth that the claws of the cholera demon have stopped dancing. Some people say that God blesses the people of Shanghai! If we take this chance encounter as a common occurrence, that is suicide. God only helps those who help themselves.</p>
<p>I am not an engineer in the Public Works Bureau, and I don't know how deep the Suzhou Creek is now, but I believe that it would never have been so shallow before. But I believe even more that it will become even shallower than it is now, until one day the silt (including garbage) is level with both banks, and the Suzhou Creek becomes a garbage road.</p>
<p>It would be better to simply fill it in to make a road, like turning the Yangjingbang into the Zhongzheng Road. Wouldn't that facilitate transportation and benefit the citizens?</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek is black, although it connects to the Huangpu River and the sea. What does black represent? It represents terror, death, filth, and meanness, but also shame and sorrow.</p>
<p>The nearly four million citizens of Shanghai see it. Can they turn a blind eye?</p>
<h3>Scores Above All, Diplomas First, Dead Education, Dead Textbooks</h3>
<p>— Qiu Jian</p>
<p>I recently read the editorial in this newspaper, "The Education System Urgently Needs Reform," and as a student under this system, I felt a particularly strong resonance. I believe that the failure of China's new education in terms of moral education, as pointed out in the article, is particularly worth emphasizing. To give an example: the rule of not spitting anywhere is something that almost every student from elementary school to junior high school can often see in books or public places. But colleges are still full of people who spit everywhere. As for other things, it goes without saying: disorder at meetings, cheating in examinations, vandalism, not keeping time, in short: the current schools, in addition to teaching students how to read fluently, or even memorize their books, do not bother to take care of everything else.</p>
<p>The students' only goal has become scores. For the sake of scores, they will not hesitate to sacrifice—sacrificing their health by staying up late is nothing, and they even sell their self-esteem to cheat. In fact, the more "strictly managed" schools are often the concentration camps of cheating geniuses. When those students leave school, it is difficult to guarantee that their goals will not turn into money or power, so they will do everything possible, regardless of everything, to cheat and seek personal gain in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>And what exactly has the heavy homework brought to the students? We won't talk about lung disease and insomnia. It is even more a matter of course to rush to do homework as soon as school is over. As a result, a student majoring in electrical engineering still has to pay someone to repair the electric fan at home when it breaks; a mechanical engineering graduate has not even made a single screw. Not to mention the practical ones, let's just talk about the theoretical ones. Formulas that were memorized last year are forgotten this year. Questions that scored ninety-nine points on the last semester's exam cannot be answered when asked this semester. The students are not unaware of this phenomenon, but they still stay up late and memorize the books as usual. The professors also don't understand the difficulties of the students, but they still stuff knowledge into the students' brains as usual.</p>
<p>So, those ducks who have been stuffed continuously for more than ten years are finally sent out of the school in batches. They open their eyes, which have been dazzled by homework, and take a look—oh dear, what kind of world is this? They discover all kinds of strange phenomena that are not mentioned in the books, and they encounter all kinds of people. They may be dissatisfied with the environment, but their bodies, which have been worn down by books for many years, are already powerless. They have no fundamental moral values, they lack a outlook on life, and even fewer people have a firm will. So when the evil forces in this evil society invade them, they are swallowed.</p>
<p>In short, the current education is only desperately increasing the weight of the students' heads, without asking them to exercise their bodies and minds, let alone fundamentally educate them to become healthy and upright citizens. If the head is heavy and the feet are light, wouldn't it fall down? This is common sense!</p>
<h3>The Land of Forgetfulness</h3>
<p>— Meng Bai</p>
<p>"China will not perish, China will not perish, look at the national hero Regiment Commander Xie!" This song once resonated throughout the entire nation. Its righteous and powerful melody stirred the hearts of the old, young, men, and women, and awakened tens of millions of spirited youths, who threw their heads and spilled their blood, dedicating themselves to the nation. Now, they have fulfilled their final duty and lie buried in the ground, but the General's surviving family members are destitute and helpless!</p>
<p>Almost a year after the victory of the War of Resistance, famine, banditry, and economic depression are rampant. However, in Shanghai, a city of singing and dancing, those who make merry are everywhere, squandering resources without restraint, and indulging themselves day and night! Have they forgotten the soldiers who endured pain and bled to death on the battlefield for the sake of the nation and the people? Have they forgotten the martyrs who died under the brutal oppression of the enemy and puppets, suffering severe torture for their unwavering righteousness? The dead are dead, but are we simply treating them as historical relics? Are we simply consigning their glorious deeds to the National History Museum, and considering the matter settled? Is this how a civilized ancient nation forgets so easily?</p>
<p>Brief Collection of Comments</p>
<h3>Court Fines Also Need Adjustment</h3>
<p>— Wu Ling Ren</p>
<p>The amount of fines imposed by the courts for criminal cases has also increased significantly with the changing environment. For example, gambler Zhu Shunlin, in addition to a four-year prison sentence, was also fined 100 million yuan. St. Francis student Xu Pei-huang and his father were fined 15,000 yuan each for defaming others. If they were unable to pay, it would be commuted to one day of labor service for every 500 yuan. I remember that before the war, it was generally one yuan for one day of labor service. Now, compared to before the war, it has increased five hundred times! And if the fine of 100 million yuan is also calculated by multiplying the pre-war amount by 500, then Zhu Shunlin's fine before the war would have been 200,000 yuan. In today's era of daily currency depreciation, will the fines imposed by the courts in the future also need to be "adjusted" from time to time?</p>
<p>The Office of the Receiving Work Investigation Team has been established to seek public opinion and facilitate investigation. It will invite responsible persons from various industries to listen to their opinions. In fact, the opinions of various industries on the receiving work have already been widely published in various newspapers in the past. Just using these many opinions as a basis for starting the investigation would be troublesome enough, but the Investigation Team is not afraid of even more trouble and wants to listen extensively again. Their spirit of diligently seeking public opinion is truly admirable.</p>
<p>The Administrative Yuan Compensation Investigation Committee is urging the reporting of wartime public and private property losses, but among the many people I know, I have not heard of anyone who has filled out a loss report form. The past pain has long been forgotten, and no one wants to seek compensation for past losses. Is this the demeanor of a great nation?</p>
<p>A foreign country has invented a wind instrument alarm clock, which is said to "have pleasant music, without harsh ringing." If this product arrives in Shanghai, I will definitely buy one at great expense as soon as possible, because I often suffer from insomnia. Having a clock with pleasant music on the bedside is perfect for lulling me to sleep.</p>
<h3>Grumbling</h3>
<p>— Wu Jian Hua</p>
<p>A female student and a male student, both under twenty years old and unmarried, actually went to Hangzhou together for a "honeymoon." Afterwards, the guardian filed a lawsuit for interference with the family, but the male and female protagonists actually said in court that this was their freedom, causing the audience to burst into laughter. "Democracy" is only in its infancy, but "freedom" has already been so abused. And this pair of protagonists, one is a student from XX Girls' High School, and the other is a Freshman from XX University. They are so young, yet already so indulgent and so knowledgeable about "freedom." It's lamentable!</p>
<p>I certainly dare not be an old fogey, with a serious face, but the necessity of the marriage system is undeniable, otherwise how can the organization of society be maintained?</p>
<h3>How Unfair!</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>The heroic battle of the "Eight Hundred Warriors" defending the Sihang Warehouse once shocked the world.</p>
<p>In history, this earth-shattering battle of the isolated army, the Eight Hundred Warriors wrote a glorious and brilliant page with their fresh blood and flesh, forever immortal!</p>
<p>Now, victory is approaching a year, and the surviving family of the late Regiment Commander Xie are still wandering aimlessly, without any place to rely on. The General's surviving family members are like a lone boat, drifting on the vast ocean! Perhaps it is that victory came too quickly, and the power of the atomic bomb obliterated the merit of the naked flesh and blood fighting, burying the sacrifices of countless heads in the past!</p>
<p>Now, the loyal bones of Regiment Commander Xie have been buried on the banks of the Huangpu River. Our national hero has shed all his blood, and he lies smiling peacefully in the netherworld. However, he could not have imagined that after his glorious death, his surviving family members would be so pitiful, with no one caring.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are sensitive and forgetful. In the beginning, everyone was eager to praise Xie Jinyuan, but now that Japan has been defeated, everyone has forgotten everything!</p>
<p>It is hoped that the government will come up with a solution, and the orphaned children of soldiers should be given comfort!</p>
<p>It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will revisit the heroic historical facts of that year and extend a helping hand of sympathy.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that even today, we must still insist on two major demands: those who indulged in pleasure and supported the enemy during the war must be severely punished, and the orphaned children of soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the country must be guaranteed! The Xie family's orphaned children have no way to borrow, and XXX is at large. We will never accept this!</p>
<h3>A Doggerel</h3>

<h3>Campus Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xin Yun</p>
<p>The desks in the classroom are broken beyond repair, some stools have only three legs, and the spittoons are only emptied every two or three days. There is only one tank for tea, and it is never refilled after it is finished. The handrails of the escalator are covered with an inch of dust. Miscellaneous fees are not only not waived, but are collected very heavily, but the principal only knows how to save money.</p>
<p>"Students' exercise books and notebooks should be purchased from the school to ensure uniformity." However, white Daolin paper notebooks outside the school only sell for 300 yuan per copy, while white newsprint notebooks inside the school cost no less than 400 yuan per copy.</p>
<h3>Traitors Are Well</h3>
<p>— Bai Lian</p>
<p>He is still eating coffee with milk, riding in a jeep in good condition, wearing a suit and leather shoes, going to interesting places, holding women and dancing waltzes and congas. Do you want to ask who he is? Do you want me to say it without hesitation: He has grabbed those chops engraved with "Minister of Finance," "President of the Central Reserve Bank," "Mayor of Shanghai," and "President of the Executive Yuan," and stamped official documents one after another. It was he who took away our old legal tender, and it was he who took away our gold, using the puppet currency he issued himself, whose value was not even worth a fart! He is a big traitor, a criminal in the financial world, and a traitor who sold out the Republic of China. His crimes are not enough to be compensated even by death, but he has not even been to jail!</p>
