<p>茲誌經濟部於八月廿九日繳集有關機關，彙合討論之決議案如次：（一）生產貸款及工貸問題（包括數額利率及簡化手續等）：（一）數額—査各種生產貸款，政府正在陸續辦理。其數額亦在逐漸增加，並無限制。（二）用途—以充作生產事業必需之流動資金爲限，各廠所需擴充事業之固定資金，必需募集股款，不能依賴貸款。（三）事業性質—生產有希望者，給予貸款，不但可以增加生產，並可以扶助事業之發展。無希望者縱予貸款，亦難期其成效，故生產貸款之核放，不能不就各個生產事業，分別決定。（四）利率—國家銀行一向採取低利政策，正在繼續進行，以减輕商民負担。（五）抵押品—國家行局放款抵押品，向以原料及成品爲主，受押時期，並有限制，現四聯總處已核定變通辦法，對於廠商所有機件，亦得提供充作一部份之抵押品，以期加緊協助生產事業之發展，凡工礦廠商，組織健全，經營成績優良者，並可由國家行局參加投資，或予以其他倡導獎助之便利。（六）簡化手續—四聯總處巳予密切注意，最近並通過各項業務章則，較前已多改善。（二）四聯總處存廢及銀行專業化問題：決議：四聯總處之存廢，本部會等未便加以討論，至銀行專業化，實際上早巳實行，毋席再爲討論。（三）組織復興實業投資公司問題：決議：原則上自屬可行，但問題牽涉頗多，尙須由主管部週密考慮。（四）外匯匯率：決議：最近已經調整，不必再加討論。（五）進出口稅與進出口連鎖制度以及貼補政策易貨政策等：決議：（一）進口稅則，已在研究準備修訂之中。（二）出口稅最近已由政府決定一律暫行免征。（三）輸入品之種類及限制，擬請行政院轉飭輸入設計委員會縝密硏究酌予改訂。（四）進速鎖制度，在實行技術上頗題，且外匯匯率甫經調整，不置議。（五）出口貼補政策，口稅已予免除，外匯匯率亦經提高，亦暫從緩議。（六）易貸政策對於若千國家，應積極計劃辦理。（七）進口貸之走私，應予嚴禁。（六）復員工廠損失補償及優待問題：決議：關於工廠在抗戰期中之損失補償，行政院巳設賠償委員會，各工廠之損失，自可遵章呈報，彙向敵方提出賠償；至於優待辦法，最近已訂定二次標售朱能售出之敵僞工廠，由後方復員工廠優先承購或承租辦法，各廠自可依照申請辦理。（七）內河航運救濟問題：決議：本案純係交通事業之救濟問題，由交通部逕行核復。</p>

<h3>全國商會聯合會開幕</h3>
<p>全國商會聯合會，籌備多年，今日在首都開慕了。在這經濟建設正需加緊進行，而各地工商業危機，又在逐漸加深的時候，全國商聯會適於此時成立於首都，使中樞當局和全國各界均能一聽工商業者的迫切呼聲，其意義的重大，當非平當時期所可比擬。</p>
<p>截至寫稿時止，商聯會成立大會所有的提案和報吿，尙未及寓目，其重心究在何處，亦無從懸揣。但我們除敬祝全國商聯會的成功而外，認爲大會對下列幾點，實有加以注意的必要。</p>
<p>其一，爲工商業的危機究應如何挽救？這問題，在此次會議中，諒係主要議題之一。也許有人以爲「危機」的釀成有心理因素在內，愈想到危機，則危機愈似迫人，而結果則杯弓蛇影，徒然自擾，因此主張不必過事誇張危機。這容有一部分理由，但决不能因此而採取鴕鳥政策，過於漠視危機，束手待斃的。無論如何，今天要說工商業沒有危機，誰也不會相信。我們在滬言滬，覺得上海市商會和市參議會先後請願各點，實已道出了危機發生的癥結，亦且相當的扼要。但有一部份究尙偏於局部，對於一般的全國性問題，尙待此次商聯會加以補充或矯正。以我國疆域之大，產品之廣，各地的經濟情形當然未必能一致。舉一個實例：如本埠工業界正殷切期待着國外原料的接濟，而內地國產原料如菸葉，棉花，小麥，大荳等，則以種種關係，或苦於無法運銷，正在另覓出路，或以價格懸殊，販賣商和製造商間未能獲得和諧的合作。全國商聯會，係各地經濟單位的總匯，當能統籌全局，擬具解救危機更進一步的總方案，以供各方面的採擇。</p>
<p>抑工商業危機的挽救，我們始終認爲其最大的前提，乃在於認識之程度，而採用何種方案當在其次。因爲有了淸楚的認識，才能產生有效的方案。方案是計劃，推動仗力量。力量不充，計劃仍是空言。所以商聯會對於本問題，實具有雙重責任，一是擬具更完整的方案，二是切實督促各方面努力實行。</p>
<p>其次爲經濟建設，究應採何種方針？國營和民營的界限問題，工業重心抑農工商並重問題，自由貿易抑參用保護政策問題，這些在中央似早有決策，但民間議論尙未盡一致。在此次會議中，當有不少的建議，提供討論。我們認爲任何建設，總須在相當的穩定狀態下，方能循序漸進，日起有功。現在經濟界的最大障礙，是在於動盪不安，使各方問忙於當前的應付，而無法着手於根本的建設。此中原因甚複雜，有由於社會的，經濟的，也有由於政治的，軍事的。全國商聯會，是全國經濟界的總集團，其代表的產生，是由各地商會自由推選的，也可說是全國經濟界最民主的總集團。若說果有所謂「第三方面」·則此眞正由選舉而來的全國工商業者的代表，比之政客們更可當之而無愧。在這時局轉捩之交，我們希望他們發揮民主的力量，提供眞正的民意，努力主張正義，明辨是非，判斷曲直，把動盪不安的情勢作一結束，方好推進經濟建設。因爲軍事政治有辦法，社會和經濟，自然也有辦法。現在的交通，物價，通貨，失業，和物資缺乏等問題，不是很明顯地都受着軍事政治之累嗎？</p>
<p>再其次，則工商界的本身問題，也似乎値得檢討。抗戰以前，政府對於經濟政策，很缺乏確定性和建設性，這是無可諱言的。再加上不平等條約的束縛，協定關稅，領事裁判權，和租界地等到處作梗，使工商界左支右絀，深陷於散漫的凌亂的苟安狀態，這實在是經濟復興的重大阻碍。現在，我們一面希望政府要確立起經濟政策來，同時也希望一般工商界要認淸時代，能配合這個國策。必須上下相維，切實合作，種種經濟政策，方饞能推行盡利。拿上海來說：近來各種配售辦法，都不能得到預期的效果，其中原因自然很多，面商人狃於過去的習慣，過於重視本身的利益，這當然也是主因之一。此後應怎樣轉移風氣，改變作風，使官與民能站在一條錢上，推行國家的旣定政策，共同努力於經濟的復興，我們認爲次不是當局片面的責任，也不是商人片面的事情。融洽上下，打成一片，共向經濟復興這大道上邁進，這是大家必須共有的覺悟。全國商聯會各位代表，來自各地，聞見較切，必能認定目標，完成他們所負重大的使命。</p>
<p>我們於此，敬祝全國商聯會的成功！</p>

<h3>蘇聯所提裁軍案　決列入大會議程　奧斯汀答覆蘇挑戰演辭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山卅一日廣播：聯合國大會今日獲驚人進展，十四國家之指導委員會一致通，將蘇聯軍縮建議置於大會議程內。大會公報謂：是項議案已交與政治委員會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎卅一日廣播紐約訊：今日聯大舉行末次全體大會，議程中規定之發表演說者，僅餘烏拉圭，盧森堡，及烏克蘭等數國代表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三十日電〕蘇聯在聯合國大會所提出之世界普遍裁軍建議，美國今日已表示贊成，惟更進一步，主張成立國際監察制，以確保眞正栽軍。蘇外長莫洛托夫昨夜在大會提議僅請進行四項計劃，並未提及監察，美首席代表奧斯汀今日在大會致詞，則已向莫氏之挑戰實行反攻。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗魯辛三十日電〕美首席代表奧斯汀今日在聯合國大會發表演說，表示美國準備與其他聯合國會員國充分合作，以實行裁軍，並宣佈其駐在外國領土內軍隊之數字。其所述之要點如下：（一）美國準備與其他聯合國會員國充分合作以裁减軍備，美國並主張提出保障辦法，以保護遵約各國而抗可能的違背或規避裁軍的定之行爲；（二）美國準備完全宣布其駐在外國領土內軍隊之數量，至於所建議之調査軍備一點，應包括國內及國外全部在動員狀態下之眾隊；（三）關於否決權問題，美國認爲對主要事件採取一致意見之原則，可以表現今日世界之事實；（四）安理會之活動有改良之餘地，使用表決方式時，應儘量避免有違反憲章原意之行爲。奧斯汀謂，莫洛托夫昨日之演說，對美國等之動機，似有不信任及誤解，余不信盟國間之相互指摘，能促進團結之實現。在戰爭時期，吾人盡力給與盟國以援助與合作，在和平時期美國亦當支持聯合國機構。吾人在戰時及平時之動機，可以留待歷史判斷，吾人在戰時駢肩而戰，並無互罵行爲，在平時何不如此。故本人對於任何指責之行爲決不參加，吾人對莫洛托夫向各國成立一致協定表示信任一點，深爲歡迎。關於栽軍問題，奧斯汀謂，美國認爲此事應列入議程予以討論。蘇聯軍力强大，提出此議殊爲適當，正如美國之提議防止原子彈之製造與使用，同樣適當。第一次大戰後，吾人之片面栽軍，實爲一種錯誤，吾人決不使此一錯誤重見於今日，吾人欲完成裁軍，必須有積極之行動，以建立戰後的和平狀態。</p>
<h3>棘手之西班牙問題　安理會舊事重提　波蘭要求撤消俾移交大會討論　蘇外長初次出席會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎卅一日廣播：西班牙問題頃經一致決議暫時錄入大會議程。又此事在大會提出　淪以前，將光交政務委員會處理。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約三十日專電〕聯合國安理會本日下午開會，莫洛托夫首次代表蘇聯出席。安理會開會後，首考慮瑞士申請爲國際法庭非法夫所定會員之事宜，此一問題未經爭辯，即決定交專委會審核。會議將休會時，波代表突以平靜之態度，建議安理會取消現仍列於其議程上之西班牙問題。藍琪以聯合國憲章第十二條規定，當安理會對任何爭端或情勢正在執行本憲章所授予該會之職務時，則大會非經安理會請求，對於該項爭端或情勢，不得提出任何建議，故要求安理會鑒於大會對辯論西班牙問題已經表現之强烈興趣，採取必要行動，俾使大會能獲得是項權利。藍氏提出建議後，會中曾一度引起騷動，莫洛托夫贊成即刻討論此提案，然埃及代表提議此一問題應經正常途徑向安理會提出，即須於三日前將問題提出要求列入議程，巴西代表表示附議，安理會爰乃決定下月四日召開特別會議，討論波蘭所提出之要求。</p>
<h3>阿控英侵犯領海　英發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕英外部發言人稱：阿爾巴尼亞指責英艦擅入阿國領海一事，顯屬不當。査英艦「索馬萊士」號及「伏拉傑「號於十月廿二日觸及水雷處之柯夫海峽，寬度甚狹，艦隻通過，勢須侵入其附近國家之領水，故國際法始終認其爲國際交通之公路。換言之，即國際艦舶均得在該處作善意無害的通過。</p>

<h3>服從正義公理　解決國際紛爭　杜魯門重申美所持信念</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山卅一晶廣播：杜魯門總統今日致函紐約先鋒論壇報稱：「聯合國大會中各國代表，均力謀加強各國間之諒解，彼等代表各國政府，一如國會議員之代表各黨各派，故其主張不能越出各該國政府訓令所許可之之範圍。吾人欲使國與國之間互相諒解，必先探究國際紛爭之根源。吾人不能以自己之信念强人茍同，亦不允他人以其信念强吾人荀同，但吾人可以吾人之信念供正義與公理之試騐，同時亦可請求他人以其信念供同樣之試騐。吾人誰亦不能屈服於武力，但世人均須服從正義與公理」。</p>
<h3>華萊士指責　美對蘇外交　導入戰爭之途</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山卅一日廣播：美前商長華萊士　在民生黨競選大會中演說稱：具爾納期受范登堡康納利及陸　軍都之慫恿，引入對蘇戰爭之危臉中。渠稱，美海軍飛機之　　於希臘上空，員爾納斯當然不　　　。同時吾人不信美國要求佔有　球羣島，因而威脅蘇聯通達海洋之出路，係出於員氏之主張·荀無范發堡與海陸軍之引線，貝氏及國務院當不致挺而走險，以留對蘇戰爭之危險。</p>
<h3>對蘇外長言論　艾帥著語言駁斥</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山卅一日廣播：艾森豪威爾將軍今在紐約前鋒論壇報發表意見，駁斥莫洛托夫日前在聯大會中之演詞。艾帥謂有人竟指美國威脅其他國家，實屬荒謬絕倫。目前駐於國外之美軍數額日減，勢將引起他國對美國之覬覦。</p>
<h3>英美輔車相依　武器標準化　英完成計劃需時十年　美利用紐澳作太平洋前進基地</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫教三十日電〕英軍已擬有遠大計劃，使其配備標準化，與美國軍械之大小型式一律。其所用步槍模型，一律重行設計，若十日砲，野戰砲。戰鬥機及海軍砲，亦將更換。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三十日電〕英軍界負責人士宣稱：英美軍政當局已商定英陸海空軍武器及彈藥標準化辦法，俾與美國兵器相配合，戰爭結束一年以來，英美曾不斷交換情報，硏究此事。英美兩國間現已具有輔車相依之密切關係，不復有何單獨軍事秘密。英國專設國防部亦與此有關。武器標準化之議，最初係由加總理在四月間聯合王國會議中提出，當時金氏會稱，加拿大深信其領士的完整及未來的安全，與美國有不可分難之關係，故防禦的軍略必須計及美國生產及科學資源，惟聯王五國會議中並未有何正式決定。艾德禮首相即與軍事當局進行硏究，旋假手英美聯合參謀團人員，作進一步具體討論，協定於是成立。依照協定，將來英國發生緊急之時，可向美國訂購大部份軍用品，以前遭遇之困難即可不再遭遇。美國則利用設立紐西蘭·澳洲及其他地方之英兵工廠，作爲前進基地。英國方面完成此項計劃尙需時十年。</p>
<h3>對荷印當局干涉　我僑商深表憤懣</h3>
<p>英荷印開始政治談判</p>
<p>〔路透社新加坡卅日電〕中國船商對荷蘭當局之干預印尼各港貿易，深表不滿。若干週前，有華人所有之船一艘爲荷海軍所搜査，且有筆人水手一名被荷軍擊斃。新加坡華僑進出口商協會已派代表至此間中國總領事署，請其呈請政府轉向荷方交涉，並要求賠償。荷蘭當局近宣布：凡航入印尼四港之商貨船，應受檢査，且船上所載商品，雖當地繳納捐稅後，猶須由荷方課以重稅。華僑對荷方此等行動至爲憤槪。</p>

<h3>美B-29機環球飛行計劃　國務院宣布暫緩批準　免被指責採用「巨棒」政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓卅日專電〕美國務院宣佈：頃應陸軍部之請，暫緩批准美陸軍航空隊B-29轟炸機之環球飛行。又美陸軍部方面宜佈：此項批准之延宕，實因國務院認爲此項飛行恐被誤解爲美國軍力之示威，雖則當局已聲明此項飛行係技術性質，蘇聯方面或仍將認其爲原子外交政策之另一塲面也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕美陸軍部請國務院核准B-29型超空堡壘編隊作環球飛行，國務卿貝爾納斯今日正在考慮如何答覆此困難問題。國務院認爲局勢「微妙」，蓋於此時顯示軍威，將使許多方面認爲美國佩劍聲響，躍躍欲試。陸軍部之申請甫於昨日正式送交國務院。國務院一部份人員感覺：自戰事終止以來，陸海兩軍部屢欲插身千預國務院擬定美外交政策，而國務院則亟望避免可能受到美國採用「巨棒」政策之指責。</p>

<h3>偽官搖身一變　居然接收大員　勾結奸商　隱匿敵產　前市府車務股長　沈文元難逃法綱　地檢處捉獲歸案偵訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕繼市府汽車舞弊案後，地檢處近又偵査一與市府前總務處車務股有關之某營造廠　匿鉅額敵產，曁前第三方面軍軍用品接收委員會物資組組長呂師尙，上海市政府車務股長沈文元檀權舞弊嫌疑案。此案係於宋院長親自審閱後，　交司法行政部轉發上海地檢處依法偵査。隊於去年十月三十日第三方面軍據密吿，謂有某營造廠隱匿大批敵軍物資，乃派組員王增略率領士兵數名，按址前往延平路三六〇號査抄計抄出被　匿敵產有火油柴油共六百餘大桶，（每桶五十加侖），自由車內外胎二百付，孟山都糖精三十聰，洋磁磚，鐵鉸鏈，鐵搭鈎等一房間，大鋼窗六十五扇，竹節鋼條七十餘祖，大料洋松板五萬餘方尺，水流鐵條五十餘担。當時因封條不敷，並未加封，擬於翌日運入第三方面軍倉庫儲存。</p>
<p>同時又至周嘉路二十九號査抄，發覺前經査封之火油等物，已空無所有。王增略當即向該廠賬房職員等嚴加追究，據其承認，小箱火油二千四百九十八箱（每箱五加侖），大鐵桶火油二百五十桶（每桶五十加侖），大鐵桶紅車油九十五桶，大鐵桶柴油一百二十九桶，均巳於十月二十三日至二十七日五天內，用第一五九五三號照會，與一五二〇六號照會之卡車陸續運走，並稱：已由廠中負責人與市府車務股長沈文元說妥云。迨十一月一日王增略率領士兵再度往延平路三六〇號搬運前項物資時，忽有自稱市府車務處長沈文元者，持第三方面軍接收委員會物資組組長呂師尙私人便條，阻止搬運，並稱此項物資已屬市府。但並未有人看管，亦未査封，根據以上事實顯係商人勾結接收官吏隱匿敵產。地檢處於本年九月二十日奉訓令後即着手偵査，於日前（二十九日）傳勝利後第一任市府車務股長沈振家到案偵訊，獲悉沈文元爲勝利前偽市府車務股長，自市府接收後沈文元仍在車務處任職，於本年二月間，此案事發始辭職。當日即由檢察官飭沈振家領捉沈文元，唯沈文元已聞風逃逸，經警務人員盡一晝夜之偵緝，始於前日（三十日）晨在一印刷所中將沈文元捕獲。承辦該案之檢察官偕書記官曾於前日親赴延平路三六〇號等處察看，其他嫌疑犯正在嚴緝中。</p>

<h3>戰時損毀過鉅　發電成本亦昂　閘北水電公司解釋　核定電費較高理由</h3>
<p>對軍政機關浪費水電尤感困難</p>
<p>本市電費已經市公用局愼重考慮，決定自本月一日起予以調整，並因閘北水電公司一部份自行發電，成本每度達三百元以上，故核定電價，較法商·華商·浦東三公司電價，每度提高六元。記者以同一市區而電費價格各有不同，特走訪閘北水電公司探詢，據負責人稱：「本公司在杭戰期間，被敵偽侵佔營業，所有工程設備，受有鉅大損失。自復業後面，因開始整理修復及恢復發電等工程設施，負債　　，更以所核定之水電費價，遠不足以維持成本，虧耗甚重。此次雖由市政當局將電費加以調整，但仍屬不敷成本，蓋公用事業煤價，自每噸三萬元增至八萬五千元，其自行發電部份。每度成本達三百元以上，即使按最高電費，亦不能租抵。其尤感困難者，本公司營業區域遼闊，綫路展佈廣泛，在抗戰時該區域房屋，大部份係屬敵軍僑駐用，迨投降撤退後，全爲我軍政機關及官佐眷屬配住，積欠水電費約共達六億元以上，均各拖延不付，而無表私自接用者，浪費水電，漫無限制，致使各路變壓器，因超過負荷量，電流時常發生障碍。最近市政當局以電源不足，曾訂有用電限制辦法，伹對軍政機關執行方面，深感痛苦，一方面固希望各機關節用物力，伹水電費不能按照規定納費，勢將使業務失却推進機能，本公司鑒於軍政機關及官佐眷屬所用水電欠費及私自接用等問題，如無激底解決辦法，則公用電流，將永無合理之配輸，現正向當局呼籲中」</p>

<p>交部規定不切實際</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自交通部規定民航業訂購新船之標準後，航業界之意見認爲稍嫌不切實際，例如以船齡而言，規定不得超過廿八年，但事實上依此規定購得之船隻，大部份爲第一次歐戰時匆匆造成之物，未必經久耐用，一如此次戰時造成之自由輪，亦非平時之理想船隻。航業界現正與交部洽商，希望對各項規定酌加修正</p>

<h3>棉紗仍有黑市　紡管會設法撲滅　四項决議移交棉紡公會　週六開會擬具執行辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織事業管理委員會於昨日下午三時，假市政府會議室，召開第九次例會。到吳主委，李副主委，委員王仰先，楊錫仁，王啓宇，郭棣活，唐星海，榮鴻元，及該會業務處長劉文騰等。首由吳主任致詞，略稱：自第三期棉紗開始配銷以後，棉紗黑市，依然存在。故亟望各紗廠除已配出之棉紗一萬二千餘件外，其餘存紗，應照常遵照議價供應市面，俾便消滅黑市。旋即開始討輪，最後決議要案四起：計：（一）無論期貨與否，自十月日五日起，一律照廿支紗一百七十五萬元之議價出售。以前期貨售價有差異者，多退少補。（二）除期貨售主有優先權外，餘紗不得拒絕出售。（三）各廠外銷棉紗數量，應報會備査。（四）無論期貨現貨，應將售主姓名，住址，數量，詳細記載，並報會備査。以上決議案，當交委員王啓宇，俾便提交本週六召開之第六區棉紡公會理事會商討，擬具執行辦法。</p>
<h3>增加南運數量</h3>
<p>又其他決議案尙有多起，計：（一）增加南運紗布數量。緣據紡管會調査，目前各地紗價，以華南爲最高。且原定南遝紗布數量，不敷該地區之消費量。經決議：紗增加二千件，連前共爲四千九百六十七件。布增加三萬五千疋，連前共爲十一萬〇六百四十七疋。紡管會現爲平抑各地紗價起見，決將調査全國各地紗布之生產與消費量，編一總表，然後統籌配銷，其配銷量將視各地之供需情形，而有伸縮。</p>
<h3>規定紗商利潤</h3>
<p>（二）規定紗商利潤。計批發價不得超過議價百分之五，以廿支紗言，即不得超過一百八十三萬七千元。門市零售價不得超過百分之十。以廿支紗言，即不得超過一百九十二萬五千元。其他支數，依此比例推算。（三）第三期本週第一次配紗價格，係照第六區棉紡公會議價委員會議定價格配售。下週起，將照紡管會前擬之議價表配紗。計開：十支一百五十二萬元，十二支一百五十八萬元，十六支一百六十二萬元，廿支一百七十五萬元，卅二支二百卅二萬元，卅二支雙股二百六十一萬元，四十支二百七十七萬元，四十二支二百七十七萬元，四十二支雙股二百七十九萬元。又第三期上半月之配紗總額一萬二千〇〇四件半，起迄日期，決定自十月廿六日起，至十一月十日止。第三期下半月配紗自十一月十一日開始。</p>
<p>又紡管會整理南運紗布廠商之複査資料等，對生產廠部份，業已吿一段落。惟運銷商部份，類多離該會所定標準頗遠。現決將標準略事降低，再行複査。一俟核准，發給登記卡，下週即可開始接受申請云。</p>
<h3>香港復拍之訊　刺激外股上漲</h3>
<p>外股昨因港埠有下月中可以復拍之訊，人心頗爲興奮，求過於供，結果較前收計怡紗英聯紙業怡啤亞洲各升一成光景，會德豐業廣鋼業漲一成不到，紙業好一成半弱。</p>
<h3>公債轉疲</h3>
<p>公債昨八樓某戶及福源脫售，市况轉疲，成交約四百餘萬元，統丙晨開一九三〇元，供過於求，即回落至一八〇〇元，而後稍平，午刻在一八五〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收回小一百元，甲乙丁各小三十元，統戊低四十元。</p>
<h3>銀根緊銷路淡　紗布一致疲落</h3>
<p>昨日紗市普遍下落，良以各廠配給所獲之紗綫，或迫於銀根，或因支數相左，不合實用，暗中仰紗市塲出籠，四十二支以下，無不下跌五萬至十萬，益以內地實銷淸淡之極，粤漢報價均吿滯跌，是以駐申辦莊均觀望不前。</p>
<p>昨日紡建公司開出細布六種，嗶嘰四種，價格細布較上决又小一千元，四君子嗶嘰則因加工成本關係，仍站住原價，往開者數甚寥寥，日來客帮銷路絕跡，同業亦因月底銀根關係，不願貼息收進，加以本市櫃銷，因天氣和暖，交易淸淡，市塲價格因亦不見好轉，跳鯉漂布前兩日竟小至九萬元，昨有漢口小單帮吸收，回漲至九萬二千五百元，可見供求於物價關係甚切。</p>
<h3>錢幣司長談　行莊復業條件　設立於抗戰發生以前　確因戰事影響而停業　並有各方面完備證件　七月十五日以前申請　　〔本報訊〕近來外界對金融業（包括銀行。錢莊。信託公司等）申請復業之事，頗多不明之處，記者爲特趨訪甫自浙東省親歸來之財政部錢幣司司長戴銘禮氏，分提問題數則，承爲解答如：（一）金融業甲請復業之主要條件爲：（甲）須設立於抗買胃不敵賣氣　華股又見萎靡　　華股昨以銀根見緊，多方仍有斬殺，大勢絕望，易被空方所壓倒，晨初各股開出尙形平定，開後不久即現鬆惆，惟永紗在七〇〇元關邊，稍費掙扎，廣帮若一六二號有納，中途雖低而尙盤，一七六號亦有納胃，但以賣方若八九號等，屢施壓力，十時十分後每况愈下，低價時尙有維持，但買胃不敵賣氣，雖多回頭，勢難維久，近午多方再吿潰散，永紗再破六八〇元低價，而美亞竟慘跌至三一〇〇元，空方從容補進，臨收稍盤，較前收熱股計永紗新光信和跌半成不到，美亞景福勤興跌半成以上，冷股五和微升，榮豐麗安水泥均平，餘都微跌，午後成交雖少，逢低有金融帮加以扶持，人心見好，熟股頗有回升，結果較前收熱股計永紗景福新光勤興信和均吿微跌，美亞則跌半成，冷股統益中紡景備新亞公司均少挫，大通榮豐中絲內衣華豐火柴水泥平平，五和稍升，塲外各股尙有微挫。戰發生之前。（乙）確因受戰事影饗而停業。（丙）須有地方政府及商會之證明，往來行莊之帳單，及向政府納稅之憑征等。（二）申請復業期限，本定本年五月五日截止。後以地區遼闊，各地申請復業之金融業，殊爲踴躍，故特展期至本年七月十五日截止。計申請復業者，共達一千五百餘家。此次財部對七月十五日截止申請之期限，執行極嚴。即遠地金融業函請復業者，亦概以信上郵戳爲憑，逾期槪不通融。至該日以後所處理之事務，均係在七月十五日以前早經申請，而證件呈繳不足，另着趕速補辦俱全，俾利審核。（三）綏靖地區之金融業，亦多備具證件，先行申請保留復業權，一俟地方轉靖，即着手復業，財部已准所請。（四）財部爲審核金融業之復業事宜，特由各關係部門，組設審査會，嚴格審核。間査有僞造證件，企圖朦蔽者，即送交法院嚴辦、決不宣貸。（五）關於錢兌業之管理事宜，財一部已擬有錢兌業之管理規則草案一全份。以茲事與中央銀行管理外一匯政策有關，平於二月前送交中交銀行研究。據透露該項規則內容要點；（甲）錢兌業應標明「一兌換店」之名稱，（乙）不能兼營一般銀行之業務等。　　又戴司長以離京將達二旬，即將於日內返京，處理要公。金鈔堅穩　　烚赤昨穩而多盤，晨開二三四萬五，人心尙好，自二三四萬一起，再盤升至二三五萬八，始有供源壓迫，逐漸下挫，十時後央行以二三三萬之價，配給一〇〇條，明配暗售之下，近午盤低至二三三萬一，始稍吿穩，午刻在二三二萬至二三三萬五間徘徊，午後市况尙穩，隔日交割升至二三五萬以上，而後稍平，結果較前收升八千，飾金掛牌紋銀銀元均無變更，暗拆銀根仍緊，息價約一角半至一角八不等。　　外幣依然平穩，美鈔暗市約四二〇〇元左右，交易未見開暢，結果與前日相彷彿，港票亦極平定，始終在九〇五元左右徘徊，結果亦無變化，港匯以申電仍在一一一元左右徘徊，仍報九〇〇元至九一〇元，印匯一〇八五元至一〇九五元，成交不多，英匯一四三〇〇元至一四四〇〇元，美匯牌價未更，交易毫無。米市堅定　生油繼續飛漲　　昨南北米市店方零化尙殷，粳秈米早緊午淡，結果軋升近千元，白元陰元立定，小麥來貨稀少，存底亦枯，價升千元，黃豆外埠去化沉悶，再入疲途，下挫千元，蠶豆汕厦不動，步跌二三百元，麩皮略升一二百元，油市甬帮略有交易，廣帮亦有問津，生油供不應求，續見猛烈上漲，再高三四千元，收盤轉呆，惟菜油及淸油，廠方售出尙多。吳市長今日召集　油餅食糧業談話　　吳市長鑒於本市食油價格又起彼動，定今日下午二時，召集本市油餅食糧各公會，及國營民營各油廠代表談話，聽取報告，決定抑平市價方針。美國棉花交易所　又暫停期貸買賣　國會已着手調查內幕　　〔路透社紐約卅日電〕紐約新奧林斯與支加哥棉花交易所今日暫停營業，因有關方面認爲有暫停期貨買賣之必要，藉以詳細調査最近棉價暴跌之原因。孟費斯現貨市塲爲今日南部唯一現貸交易之中心。現貸價格每磅二九·四五美分未更，賣出一萬一千九百七十四包，而昨日售出者則爲六千三百六十二包。　　〔聯合社紐約卅日電〕在過去兩星期中，自杜魯門總統宣佈解除物價統制以來，（並不直接解除棉價之統制），各種棉花之價格每磅約跌美金一角，星期二夜之收盤價每磅不及美金三角，而十月八日價格最高時幾近四角一磅，棉價之暴跳，已引起參議員湯姆斯之指責，聲稱其中有投機陰謀作祟，國會方面已着手調查內幕。　　美棉暴跌之分析與觀測　　査美棉現貨，本年最高時，曾達每磅三九，七八美金分，（十月三日），十月中旬以後，即開始下降，至十月二十二日，一度落至三三，四五美金分，其後轉形穩定，市價盤旋於三六，〇八美金分左右，二十五日以後，復繼續猛跌，迄至卅日，棉價竟陷入三角關內，落爲二九，九〇美金分，較最高時暴跌九，八八美金分，即九八八磅音，實爲一九二〇年來所罕有之現象，按此次美棉暴跌之原因，約有下列數點：（一）杜魯門總統十月十三日廣播稱，鑒於近來物價之上漲影響羅斯福前總統之安定民生計劃，故對於物價政策，尤其棉織品方面，將作合理之調整，（此項調整係抑價非中國之作漲價解釋）（二）本年美國棉產額，歷决佔計，爲近十年之最低額，因此數月前市價步漲，但最近計算美國上年存棉，及今年收成，除供給國內消費及出口外，仍多四百萬包，轉爲下年度之用，故不感覺缺乏，或亦爲以前漲價反動原因之一。（三）近數月蘇聯有棉花輸入英國，美棉歐洲市塲當受相當影響。（四）空方在有利狀態下，加緊活動，亦爲推波助瀾之原因。（五）一九四六年棉貸，因政府戰時扶助之措置，已非必要，故將予削减，至少有一四，八〇五，〇〇〇包，不能享受津貼制。（六）美國紡廠棉花消費，戰時每年爲一千一百萬包，戰後爲一千萬包，比戰時减退一百萬包。以上爲美棉傾跌之主要因素，惟吾人再觀察世界棉花之供需情况，本棉花年度，各國可供給之棉花，估計爲四千二百萬包，比一九三九年减少七百萬包，較一九三五——三九年平均量亦减五百萬包。　　然一九四六——四七年之消費量，比一九四五——四六年約增百分之九，因是一九四六年八月一日之上期滾存較一九三五——三九年之平均滾存數勢將低落　　據美農部聲稱，本年八月一日止，棉花存底爲七百五十萬包，一九四五年同期爲一千一百二十萬包，一九三九年同期爲一千三百萬包，顯見單薄，又據該部預測，一九四七年八月一日之存底，至多不超出四百萬包，而美國新棉生產估計爲八百卅萬包，乃一八八八年以來第二次最低記錄，美國會方面爲挽救棉價續落起見，已有加增對德日輸出之計議，是以棉花之基本統計，情勢實甚良好，預料跌勢不久即可戢止，目前我國原棉仍感缺乏，不足之數，勢必尙須仰賴外棉，故美棉之跌價，實不啻爲紡織業獲取廉價原料之機會，藉以减輛紡織品之成本也，（施鑫泉）</h3>

<p>衛生與医药每星期五出版對衛生行政會議的祝望  陳文斯　　三十五年全國衛生行政會議定於今日在南京開幕。其目的不外檢討施政的缺陷與效果，共求適當的補救，以期奠定民族健康的基礎，維護並增進全民族的健康。　　衛生行政的重心，在配合建國的歷程，增進社會福利，保障民族健康。因健康爲達到個人與國家的安全及幸福的一個重要因素。個人與集團的心理健康，對於造成人類的和諧關係，是非常重要的。使所有人民充分獲得醫學，心理學，及其有關知識的利益，爲必需達到的目標。政府對於人民健康，負有責任，惟有以供給充分的衛生作業，才能履行。英·美·蘇三國，在國內衛生設施，即朝向此目標遭進。美國醫藥衛生設施的普遍與進步，甲於世界。去年杜魯門總統在致國會的咨文裏，尤其充分表示出美國醫藥衛生之更將社會化的趨勢。英國政府在本年三月二十一日，也宣布了國家衛生服務法，在這個法案之下，每一個國民都可以享受到健康的保障。蘇聯在憲法裏，更早已承認勞動人民有享受健康保障的權利。所以我國應急起直追，努力發展衛生事業，以與世界先進國家並駛齊驅。　　這一次衛生行政會議是復員後的第一次會議，也是建國伊始的首届會議，這是歷史的里程碑，也是民族的健康基點。旣往東亞病夫之恥，勿庸再叙，惟希望確定一個亡羊補牢的策略，以作民族復興的設計和方針，在這方面的問題，應該獲得成就，否則便掩蓋不住大會的失敗。　　（一）促進衛生立法　　我國的憲法草案對於衛生行政，毫未提及。雖立法院三讀通過之憲草（二十三年十月六日發表），曾有臚列，終在最後公佈的憲草中被删掉，吾人不無遺憾！憲法爲國家根本大法，理應列入衛生行政一項。願大會確定原則，據理力爭，期能於此次國民大會制定憲法之時，於憲法中確定衛生政策。同時過去制定的衛生行政法規，現已不能適應公醫制度要求，應擬訂一個衛生行政的基本法。本於三民主義衛生政策的特質，與公醫制度的精神，使衛生行政系統，國家的衛生設施，人民的衛生權利與義務，都加以具體的規定，使適合於現代國家衛生建設的要求，以爲實施的準繩。　　（二）限制都市開業　　科學醫醫師不够分配，就不當任其自由開業，旣准自由開業，就應加以管轄限制，使在政府衛生政策大原則下，執行業務。今大都市佈滿市儈醫師，大都做金錢的奴隷，權貴的侍者；公共醫院都乏人服務，荒僻的鄉縣，更找不到醫師。負責衛生行政的當局，應從速設法糾正，使醫師與人口密度成正比。最好的辦法，目前先指定一二大都市，盡近擴充公立醫院設備，絕對禁止開業醫師存在。待實施有效果後，再逐漸施用於其他都市，將開業醫師限制於鄉村市鎭，爲農民服務。　　（三）禁止販售成藥　　以往中央衛生當局，取締成藥的原則，似乎是祇要不含嗎啡，就可以核准給照，素不追究其是否眞正有效。以致現在有許多萬應萬靈，萬病都治的成藥，大吹大擂的宣傳『「衛生署化騐合格」七個大字頂在頭上。這般騙人的成藥，每年不知要吸取民衆多少萬億的錢財。民衆出了奢侈的代價，除得了一點政府「認可」的虛妄安慰外，並沒有得到醫藥的實惠，甚或反遭其害。負有管制成藥責任的執政者，實際是鼓勵荒謬的成藥，協助他們騙取民財，這是倒行逆施。爲了確保民命，我們祈求衛生行政常局堅決絕對禁除所有各種成藥的發售，並嚴禁新聞紙類刊登欺騙性廣吿；否則，若果政府感到無能，乾脆取銷成藥的管理，讓人民自己去分辨眞僞！　　（四）組訓各地中醫　　中醫不科學，反科學，本應取締，因醫事人員不够分配，姑准存在，就應當嚴格管制，並從速將他們充實起來。縱然說不上科學化，數種法定傳染病的知識，是容易灌輸的。故應視谷地情形，對所在地的中醫，分別組織，加以訓練，使至低限度能了解該地普通常見之傳染病，並限制專門作一二種地方病之治療。若果不遵守此種規定，胡作亂爲，則撤銷執照，禁止開業。如此整飭改進，於民衆健康，將有俾益。　　（五）推行衛生敎育　　衛生敎育乃公共衛生事業之根本要務。如人民衛生智識淺缺，在上者雖竭力提倡，究不免重重障礙，故應推行衛生敎育，使人民改善生活，培養衛生習慣，以增進個人健康及社會安全。而衛生敎育之推行，以我國現狀而論，應以國民敎育爲中心，此則賴敎育當局合作，同謀策進。師資訓練，尤爲先決問題。此外新聞紙類，可爲普及衛生敎育之良好機關。又如衛生雜誌，標本電影，廣播等，皆可使人民對於衛生之利害確實明瞭，而易收美滿之效果。願勿忽視及此。　　目前，全國衛生行政會議必須注意社會福利的增進，與國民體格的提高。政府應該在公醫制度的原则下，使科學醫與公共衛生的學識都盡量以合理的組織與有效的設施，普及民間，使全國入民在醫藥與衛生的享受方面，不論貧富貴賤，一律平等。政府本於增進人民健康與人民生活環境之改善，側重疾病的預防與治療，選擇急應解決而易解決之事項，先期付請實施。　　我們期待這次衛生行政會議的成功，希望在會議中播出令人興奮，鼓舞的消息，同時發射出明亮的光輝。這次大會的召開，國人帶有覺悟性的企盼，冀求有更多的希望與更大的辦法降臨。這次大會應有最大的決心，凡認定應該幹的，均應採取「大刀闊斧」的手段，努力以赴大會的決策，更應採取眞正領導的地位，積極促進全民族的健康，這是最切望的一點。　　當全國衛生行政大會揭幕的良辰，我們謹掬至誠，敬祝大會工作的成功，並祝諸位代表健康愉快！論處方與打針（上）  錢德　　「醫生請您替我開張常服的方子」，「要不要打針？請您替我打一針」，每踏進診室，病人總提出這一類問題與請求，爲此所費解答與說明往往佔去很可觀的一部時間，着實使您頭痛。然而在病人看來，醫生應該處方，處方又最好是打針，這種思想十分錯誤而危險，可又十分廣泛而深刻，請就此問題加以討論與申說。　　每當病人有病痛而就診於醫生，他所急切需要的是痛苦的解除，所最要知道的是所患能否及何時才能痊癒。醫師的任務則是予以適常的處理以减其當時最感痛苦的症狀，而此此更重要的是先査淸其病源，確定診斷，然後針對此一病原，擬定治療方針，結癥能去，則諸種症狀全消。否則譬如闌尾炎患者有腹痛而嗎啡一針，或者因其有胃陽系症狀而給以瀉劑以求「淸一淸」，診斷不明而僅用頭痛醫頭的辦法，無有不釀成嚴重的後果的。這例子很易瞭解，但可惜病人與醫師兩方都急功好利，這種例子並不少見，甚至連醫師本人也犯有這錯誤。要免除這種不幸，醫師固然要熟心診査，虛心觀察診査；病人也要有耐性的等候發展。需知大多數疾病誠然可以一目了然的迅速建立診斷，而疑難之例，則需經種種實騐室試騐X光檢査等，可能經月不得結果。這正是科學醫的科學之處，不能與中醫之按按脈就可於數分鐘內開出草藥數十味相提並論之處。在此時期，即使給藥，也以給些不致隱蔽其症狀的藥物爲原則；除非醫生不負責，則經此多觀察一天，病情多認識一點，診斷的建立也近一天，針對診斷而得根治的把握也因此多一點。倘然病家不能瞭解其苦心，以爲這是浪費時間金錢，於是天天換醫生，昨天服中藥無效，今天要求打針，明天又去另找醫生服藥，自以爲試騐品，藥石亂投，病情因此越弄越糊塗，小病弄成大病，重病爲此送命，這是誰的錯誤？所以我首先要鄭重指出：診斷第一，治療其次，診斷未定而華石亂投，有爲害而無一利。　　（二）醫師之能力有限　　病人來找醫生，無不抱有希望與信心，以爲一經診治，病當立癒，而病之所以能吿痊，總是醫生之功。作者自己是內科醫生，問一問有幾人是非您治不可的？有幾人確是您治癒的？可說百分之九十以上的病人之所以能痊癒，還靠病人自己。除了極少幾種病如白喉，肺炎等用血清及化學療法確能减短病期滅少死亡率以外，即使是所謂特效藥如九一四之對於梅毒，奎寗之對於瘧疾，雖經長期標準治療，也不能必其根治。至於日常病人，或許服藥之後進步一些，再自己調養而恢復；或者豪無好處，又去請敎別位醫師，再不與您發生關係。倘然以爲這些病人是您所治癒的，這是貪天之功；倘然因此跟着宣稱某藥對某病有特效，這是自欺欺人，向誤誤人。　　上面說大多數病人之所以能痊癒靠他自己，靠的是人體自身的抵抗力（白血球與免疫體），修補力（新生與結瘢），解散力（大小便與汗液之分泌）及休息。憑此，最常見的呼吸系感染，胃腸系失調，心力衰竭，普通傳染，乃至輕度中毒都有自動恢復的機會。講到服藥打針，急性傳染病如天花，麻疹，百日咳等都不因藥物治療而减短病期，對於傷寒病，良好的護士能比高明的醫師還多做些工作慢性病如結核也晚不了休息營養與空氣三要素。外科也許比較的可以有著明手術成就，伹是手術創還得靠病人自力瘉合，骨折也是靠病人自己生長接合的。外科祖宗柏瑞Ambroise　Pare早在十六世紀就說：「我替病人裏創，上帝使他痊癒」，正說明醫生能力有限，一切還靠病人自己。　　（三）醫師之責任無窮　　他大之負有增進國民健康之責，小之握有病人生死之機，責任可說十分艱鉅，因之他應有良好的按術，更需要有高度的道德心與責任心！要能解瞭病人心理而不違背醫德以迎合其心理，要有儘早完成其對病人所負診治之功的責任心而不急功貪功，要保守他業務上之秘密却肯虛心公開其診斷與治療或歡迎其他醫師會診，在某種情形下不能不說謊伹又不能毫無限制的給病人家屬以極渺茫的希望，至於佈迷陣　曲折使病人迷信非您不可，從而吸取其診金，那更是罪惡。　　在平時，醫師要做病人的顧問，注意其日常生活習慣之改善，灌輸以普通疾病之來源或傳染途徑之常識，並用預防注射以增其抵抗力而阻止其流行。這樣，天花班疹傷寒傷寒霍亂痢疾白喉百日咳在犬病破傷風及許多寄生虫病都可以預防，許多一經感染無法回生的死亡可以避免或减少　　在診治期巾，醫師是病人的保姆，行船的柁工任務在於扶持病人使其順利過去，並能認出併發症而給以適時而適常的治療。給予病人以該病的常識使瞭然於可能發生的意外也是必要的，特別是糖尿病，心臟病，消化性潰瘍，結核，腎炎等病人，不能天天登醫師之門來求治，假如吿訴他如何注意日當飲食休養及如何預防可能發生之意外，一定能收事半功倍之效，少臨事慌張之苦　　總之他要細心，要大胆，要循原則，也要能圓活的藝術化運用他的醫術。懂得這藝術的運用使得醫生成名成功，然而候診室最擠的醫師未必是最好的醫師，病人縱然有「能得名醫一診死亦甘心」的心理，殊不知他知名他忙，他未必能細心，「一將功成萬骨枯」，知名醫生的名也是建築在病人生命之上，這是値得醫師與病家警惕明瞭的。醫治𦙊髓炎等癥用之呼吸器醫藥新知　百日咳將被征服  紹　　百日咳一症向無特效治療。病兒咳嗆連作，痛苦不堪，且病期甚長，往往達數月之久。病後恢復徐緩，易罹結核。幼兒患之，死亡率甚高。　　對於此症，除解痙止咳等對症療法外，向有百日咳菌苗（Pertussis　Vaccine）試於預防與治療，預防固有相當效果，但其治療價値極爲可疑。　　最近有多種血淸製出，其防治百日咳之效力較菌苗爲佳。據去年美國醫學會之報吿，用於預防，效力在80％左右。對於已病者，如早期用之，可減輕其病勢，縮短其病程，而降低其死亡率。　　百日咳血淸主要如下：　　高度免疫抗百日咳人血淸（Hyperimmune　human　pertussis　serum），其特點在其局部與全身反應。人與病菌之戰（八）  喬樹民　　摘自「傳染病管理」　　（四）檢疫留騐——檢疫留騐，在將曾有可能的暴露感染機會者，予以留禁檢視，直至潛伏期滿爲止，用意至善。但實施時極難收效，且多不便，其故有五：　　一·有一有十傳染病，不易覺察，不易檢出，或其傳染期限遠較留騐期限爲長。　　二·健康的帶菌者，更難發覺。　　三·有若干傳染病，於尙未呈現　著的症狀之前，已具有極强的傳染性。　　四·留禁過久·不僅防礙商業行旅，每可促成食料匱乏，轉不利於防病，甚致發生走私舞弊，或隱匿病情。　　五。留騐期間，强將病者與健康者居留一處，亦不合適。　　檢疫留騐，雖有上述諸多不便或難收實效之處，但爲防止某種重大傳染病流行起見，各國仍皆採用，並時時改進之。通常檢疫，約可分爲下列四種：　　A海港檢疫——此爲國際共同合作之機構，我國亦設有海港檢疫所。　　B內地檢疫——爲防止某種劇烈流行（鼠疫霍亂等）之蔓延起見，內地之交通綫上，恒有設立臨時檢疫留騐機關之必要。　　C學校檢疫——兒童對於一般傳染病之感受性較强，故應予以特別注意，有傳染病發現之家庭，其學童應禁止人校，直至傳染期限完畢爲止，有時爲防疫而關閉學校，伹需考慮其利弊而後行之。　　D家庭檢疫——有劇烈傳染病發現之家庭，每需採用家庭檢疫留騐，直至傳染期限完畢或預防接種成功爲止。　　（五）帶菌者之取締——帶菌者每爲主要病源之一，前已言之，對於　時性的短期帶菌者，當可用上述之隔離檢疫方法取締；對於慢性的長期帶菌者，則宜用下列方法處置之：　　A其能施用外科手術根治者，則根治之；其無法根治者，則宜二　　B禁止其從事於足以傳播疾病之職業。爲公衆之利益計，每宜由政府出資贍養其生計，以免其爲生計所迫，而陽奉陰違，私自操業。　　（六）貯菌動物之撲滅——動物傳染病之危害人類者，主要有乳牛之結核，馬爾他熟，流行性鏈球菌喉疾，馬之鼻疽，犬等之　咬病。鼠之鼠疫。及急性傳染性黃疸病等，以及其他如炭疸病之類，衛生機關（獸醫部份），均宜設法撲滅抑制之。</p>

<p>春秋吳稚暉先生之篆書　　附「纒纏賬」引  賀天健　　夫書寫，原無所謂法；徒以爲符號之用耳。自章草起而至鍾王之行楷，乃入藝術之境：所謂永字八法：「筆陣」，「飛白」等，俱以法則樹立學習之基本；而欣賞之興味，亦似乎非此不能逗引而出。於是由字之本身而及乎行列更至於一幅之款式。蓋僅以書法之妙尚不足以盡其能也。所謂「氣」「力」「神」「韻」「式」「態」須無一不能，始克飫欣賞者之眼。夫書有法豈易言而易爲哉。然則箔篆如何？蓋節也，篆也，其始起也本無法，後人觀其詰屈盤旋，結構輪奐，而以爲自有法則存在，及描焉，乃習焉，實則用筆直注，有雄直之氣，非有意爲之；是其器具之硬軔耳；以較諸草行，則有間矣。然而，及乎近千餘年來則不然，蓋以柔毫竹管，握之以畫；器既別而法乃生，法無則難從事。—是箔篆乃後人以法法前人；行草則前人以法法後人也。　　余持此說有年矣。日前與吾鄉前輩吳稚老談篆書之法，即以此說質之。稚老曰：「篆書，本纒纏賬耳。我（稚老自稱）並非喜學篆書也。徒因幼時研習小學，常常翻閱說文部首。乃得興趣焉；而後始漸漸好爲之。或謂篆書之內自有法則在焉。但否則仍以無法法之也。子之說而於否則似未盡然。」　　稚老之言蓋以無法爲法也，夫藝事之上者，本以無法爲法；中者以有法爲法，下者法而不法。稚老之篆，乃藝之上者；所謂大家之書耳。論今日書篆者，以筆觀之；圓勁挺秀舍稚老其爲誰。吾知必曰稚老。李陽永之篆法往往在稚老篆書中見之，欲下面先上，欲左而先右，疾下面緩收，先緩而後回，此篆法之不二門色。李陽永有之；則稚老之於篆大有法矣。所謂篆書乃纒纏賬，　具有至義；在篆字而言纒纏，　　地有法，在稚老人生觀而言纒纏賬，則道地有生存之法；在　人觀之焉得謂稚老無法。因作「纒纏賬引」投呈稚老。稚老曰：「此真詩也。此等詩以外無有詩，詩須如是乃可作」余受寵若驚，學詩四十五年今日乃得定論於稚老，自不無知己之感，更錄呈進珊先生，爲此文作一煞尾。　　纒纏賬，世間無事不纏纒；一賬纏了再一賬，如果纒纏如槆連，（因稚老談及盤瓠氏）。槆連也是纒纏爾。當其連時鐵石堅，索性一刀斬之斷；纒纏之賬便即捐；此過此槆與此槆暫時可以不纏了，然而彼槆與彼槆一邊依舊鎖牢一條鞭。此一鞭還是盤瓠氏，還是烏龍氏？這賬無從算得全。纒纏到今真該死，如何還要纏出三十六天罡七十二地煞，做成糊塗賬一篇。先生纒纏纏出幾千年前篆文來，也與今人纏舊賬，可惜只算得幾張花紙錢。臭肚皮，餓不得；老骨頭，不能仙。我也東塗西抹纏一下，其實也只爲了吃喝大小便。地球纏東西，日月纏歲年；纏來纏去纏出點什麼來，還不如喒門舊賬新纒纏得十分研。一寸山河一寸血　79  葉勁風　　「怎麼哪？—城裏弄到了一票？……」侉子瞇起一雙大約千來度的近視眼睛，哆開了嘴，露出一口又亂又大，上了釉的牙齒。　　法寶收了功效，符也畫靈了；然而冷汗也出了一身。從侉子口裏，我們知道這個魔窟並不如我剛才幻想的那麼「稀鬆平常」。我們今天算是趕了一個巧，因爲寇軍十成開走了九成半，高級人員都隨軍出伐，這裏成了後防的後防，所以鬆懈了下來，否則這部車子，哪怕是日軍開着，也必得經過許多麻煩，才能開進。這是敵軍空巢出動之後，僅有的現象。　　然而我們現在坐的地方，還是外圍。裏面順手邊進去，有個老寨，可以算得「中國地界」，是日寇，偽軍，衛隊，保安隊等，吃喝作樂的大本營，呌作什麼「招賢堂」，是個糜亂不堪的淪陷區縮影；各色妓女，各種賭博，各樣毒品，可以任意御用。據說裏面妓女和戲班的坤角，總計不下一二百名。可只有一個條例，只能活着進來，決不能活着出去。其餘的偽軍，衛隊，却並不多，確數不知，大約不過二三百人，都是日寇和殷逆的手下牽引進來的。其他也有老寨留下的本地混混，和些守着產業不願離開的本地人，老侉本人，從前當過衛隊，後來白丐　大了，眼睛也壞了，就派到這裏管柵欄。還有一個老婆，在「招賢堂」廚房裏當差。　　真正的大本營，還得由左邊這條路，經過半里多地才能達到。從這條路入口起，都是禁衛區，除了殷逆本人和隨身親近，侍役等，誰也不能進去。老侉自己說，他流落在這裏已經三年，資格老了，裏邊才去過兩次。據說裏邊飛機場，軍火庫，營房，廣場，都相當大，寇軍成千成百，常常調去調來，沒有確數。除了這些，裏面還有一個高級的遊樂場所，有着窮奢極慾的怖置，殷逆的日子，都在這裏消磨着。另外還有一個刑事場，那就是小型的地獄，或集中營，一旦進去了，別想活着出來。　　我同虎弟，一對一聲，把這些情形，都由侉子口裏套了出來，很巧妙地，僅僅只花費一個二十元的代價。（夠敷衍他兩個足月的白丐賬）我們又把禁衛區裏面的情形，地勢，也弄出一個大概。並且知道裏面這時只留下了一兩個小隊，在担負禁衛的職務。　　難道說這老侉竟是一個傻瓜？他肯爲了這點小便宜就把話都說出來？殊不知我是把以前學的一點偵查心理的本領，盡量運用了出來，虎弟却是那麼乖巧的從旁點逗着，又加上「彭公案」的江湖義氣資料，也幫了我們不少忙。小說迷祇要跟他多談些小說裏的人物，他沒有不傾筐倒匣，把自已的十八般武藝，祖上的德行，和心底下藏着的零碎，都搬出來的道理。況且除了小說迷之外，他還是個白丐迷咧。　　這時我們才知道，今天此行，道道地地是個僥倖。所冒的險，到這時（上午十一點多鍾）爲止，不算大，也不怎麼小。譬如說，要是衛崗上的那個日人，稍稍犯些肝火毛病，說不定我們已經幹下了可怕而又無價值的事哩。　　從這時候起，直到傍晚七點止，這幾個小時，怕要算我同虎弟有生以來，最難過的一個時間。起先，我們直接找到「招賢堂」的廚房裏，替老侉帶了口信給他的老伴，一個四十多歲的女人，呌她替夫侉作一盆炸醬麵條，差小聽差送到前面去。這女人看樣子倒像一個典型的北方婦人，有一張很熱鬧的嘴，一雙勤快的手，在廚房裏管着雜務。陳抱一逝世一週年  劉獅　　爲窮死的藝人家族　請伸出同情的手來　　　　前天，在友人處聽到一個不幸的消息，說是亡友陳抱一先生的遺物要拍賣，使我難以相信這消息的正確。於是決定立即跑去訪問一個明白。　　陳抱一，在中國的藝壇上，雖不能安上巨星，權威，重鎮，大師這類的銜頭，但，他確是一個忠實于藝術的殉教之徒，也是一個努力藝教百折不撓的功臣，並且是爲人厚道安份守已的一個好好先生。凡是認識他的人，我想都不會否認我這幾句話吧。而今他默默無聞的與世長辭了，到現在，已是整整的一週年。在其本人總算脫離人生的苦海，逃出了這卑污黑暗的世界；可是，遺留下的未亡人和年青的孤女將如何呢？賣傢具生活，賣光吃盡之後又如何？…………我一面走一面想，想來想去，甚至想到了自己，也想到許多到了死亡綫上的窮苦藝術家們。　　靜安寺路張家花園十二號，八年前我常去，因此極熟悉，一進門，我就直向陳先生原來的書斎閣進去。詎料屋主早已換了朝代（據說被其胞姐爲了金條頂與他人），經詢問之後，才知道她們已搬在樓上的一間小房間裏。當我會見她們的時候，彼此幾乎不相識了，別離了八年，陳夫人已失去當年的健康，綠子小姐也長高了，素愛整潔的家庭，已變爲一個零亂不堪的拍賣場，畫架，畫框，瓶瓶罐罐，橫七豎八的雜陳一屋，尤其是因爲十分鍾前才把大書櫥賣掉，所以一些珍貴的書籍也祇有讓它堆在地上……　　陳夫人和綠子小姐鳴咽的講述了她們八年來和生活的苦鬥經過，才知道陳先生之死是冤枉的。與其說他是病死，無寧說他是窮死來得切實。——吃不起飯，吃大餅和豆湯，醫不起病，只有一天天的拖，拖到最後無藥可救，終於化爲這包骨灰（按陳先生遺體己化爲骨灰，準備携回廣東原籍安葬）。　　陳先生原是小康之家，父親曾任招商局要職，胞姐也是個「女教育家」。他過去在江灣曾自建畫室，其生活在當時頗爲同儕羨慕。戰事起，建築毀于炮火，事業隨之停頓，生活逐漸困難，八年來，仍醉心繪事，提倡藝教，從未改行，因此坐吃山空，以至演成今日之悲慘局面。　　今于文藝茶座與華林，春苔進珊諸先生談及此事，大家都認爲應該秉正義與同情的立場給他的家族以熱烈的同情和實際的援助才是。換言之，陳先生的藝術是否值得大家替他表揚，使之傳世，這還是有待日後藝術批評家去予以公正的研究的次要疑案，目前的問題是急不容緩必須使生者如何活下去。好在陳先生的知友甚多，我們都是力量薄弱者，於此，僅以拋磚引玉的方式，代爲哀告于諸明哲之前，盼望在最短期內使她們能得到真正有力的扶助，恢復正常的生活。詩與日常生活  馬御風譯　吉村冬彥作　　日常生活的世界和詩歌的世界的境界，只被一塊玻璃板隔開着。　　這塊玻璃板，一開頭就糢糊不明。　　被生活世界的灰塵所污而糢糊不明。　　作爲兩個世界的通路，照例只有一個狹小的洞眼亮着。　　可是，常常在兩個世界裏進進出出，則這個洞眼就逐漸大起來。　　可是，如果暫時不進出，這個洞眼自然又漸漸狹起來。　　有些人從來就不知道這個洞眼的存在，或雖然知道而不想特別去搜尋牠。　　這就是因爲玻璃糢糊不明，看不見相反的一面，或是……因爲十分忙碌。　　也有看見了洞眼而不能通過去的人。　　這是因爲身體十分過於肥胖的緣故……　　可是，雖是這樣的人，也有因生病或貧困而瘦了，便可以通過去的。　　少，極少有拿天的火燄將這境界的玻璃板通統溶去的人。雅室讀畫  華林　　薛華立路汪亞塵畫室中，巧遇孫福熙先生，他出示一幅『棕櫚仙掌』，有汪亞塵補鳥，沈尹默題字，可謂三絕，孫先生大家都有知道是一位名畫家，而同時是一個散文的詩人，山陰是他家鄉，抗戰中在雲南任縣志主編，曾至桂林主持旅行雜誌桂林版，兼任國立東方語文專科學校教務長，暇時作畫，滇南風物頗多研究，作有苗人風俗盡數百幅，而以棕櫚仙掌，堪稱傑作，孫福熙與汪亞塵兩位作家，都是因爲八年抗戰，而埋頭苦幹的結果，使藝術進步到渾然天真，潛移默化，故筆觸色彩，不假人力安排，物我忘機，性情畢露，可謂臻於妙境！，試讀孫先生傑作，棕葉扶疏，仙掌亭立，潤色濃淡之中，起人一種明朗清醒之感，沒有一點人間烟火氣了！棕椆仙掌汪亞塵補鳥蟲沈尹默題字  孫福熙</p>

<p>自由談設筵  少夫　　路加福音十四十二節至十四節中說：你擺設午飯或晚飯，不要請你的朋友，弟兄，親屬，和富足的隣舍；恐怕他們也請你，你就得了報答。你擺設筵席，倒要請那些貧窮的，殘廢的，瘸腿的，瞎眼的，你就有福了；因爲他們沒有甚麼可報答你；到義人復活的時候，你要得善報答。　　耶穌這個比喻是在詮釋「愛是不自私」，也正符合中國的「施恩不望報」那一格言。　　天地良心，今日蹌蹌踉踉熙熙攘攘於上海各酒樓飯店的，幾無一不是爲了圖報答，或是在報答人。有一個從內地來上海的朋友，住了三天便嚇得溜之乎也，他用上海白說：「喫弗消哉」！眞的，三天中，餐廳有人宴請，不去得罪人，去則領不了那份情，（有許多主人僅與他有一面之緣，因同席關係而認識的）所以衹好滑腳一走了之。　　上海請客的風氣頗流行，這也是造成大家無事忙的主要原因。能不能將這筆錢，節省下來，送給那些眞正餓着肚子需要一頓飯才能活命的人們哩！　　深秋季節，如果人們乃有旅行雅興，我願推薦蘇北是個好去處，大家不妨欣賞一下那一地方的景象。相信欣賞之餘，就知道在這裡所大張的筵席是代表一種什麼意義了。美國九位女議員　大都靠丈夫的「牌頭」  郁強　　美國的政治真到現在還是男人們的玩意兒。　　從無選舉權爭到選舉權；從無被選舉權爭到有被選舉權。「婦女參政」的口號，雖喊得澈天的響，可是美國婦女在政治舞臺上却表現得如此微弱。自從蒙太那州的金納特·　金變成了第一個進入男子世界的國會的女議員以來，迄今已有近三十年的光景，但是今天坐在眾議院中的婦女不過九位（眾議員總數的百分之一多些）而這個數額歷屆很少變更，頂多增加一兩席而已。如按人口的總數分配起來，美國國會中應當有二百五十名以上的女議員。　　美國女議員之所以少，主因可以說，還是在於婦女本身對於政治生活的缺乏。很少的婦女想試從區議會爬到市議會，再爬到州議會，最後，走進了參議院的大門。還有一個原因，就是地方黨部對婦女的歧視，很少提名她們爲候選人。所以，一個女子要進入國會，是比男子需要更大的能力和更多的精力。　　美國國會內女議員的數額雖趨小，但是她們對會內外的影響却較男議員篇大。這理由就是；「物以稀爲貴」，就是因爲婦女很少當選議員的，所以一登「龍門」之後，別人就另眼相待，她們也因而獲得較大的宣傳力和注意力。　　寡婦議員　就一般的來說，女議員們不是有聲望的聞人的太太就是男議員的夫人或寡婦。例如：現任的九位女議員中，就有四位是男議員的寡婦。最近三度訪華的「時代」「生活」和「幸福」三大雜誌的發行人亨利·魯斯，其太太也是議員。魯斯夫人曾於戰時訪華，我國人對她相當熟悉。她今年四十三歲，是美國國會中最年輕最漂亮的女議員。　　「寡婦議員」又可分做「榮譽的」和「工作的」兩類。「榮譽的」都是被提名繼承她的亡夫，直待她的孩子們歸來，以決定誰去保持議席。通常，她們的議員生涯都很短促，衹有一任而已。　　「工作的」寡婦們雖然時常在競選利用她們的丈夫的名字號召，但是她們本身都有政治的能力，並且用功績去保持她們的議席。她們的議員生涯都是很長。例如：今年高壽七十一歲的諾登夫人和六十五歲了的勞吉斯夫人都已在眾議院中混了二十一年。　　九位女議員中有一位是老處女，芳名叫：傑茜·賽姆納。她對自己的年齡，如同一般的未嫁女子一樣，諱莫如深。有人說她今年芳齡四十七歲了。她是美國國會中極端的孤立主義者和保守份子。當美國國會討論對德國和義大利實戰時，她是唯一投反對票的人，她認爲衹要派一個代表團去和希特勒談判一番，一切事情　解決了。　　一般而論。女議員對社會法案的關切較男議員稍強。她們大概都是自由主義者。對婦女，兒童和健康的問題自然是較男議員們關心。但是最近三年來，這九位女議員對重大的議案僅有一次是全體同意的。　　女投男票　美國總統選舉期又逼臨了。我們從新聞中看到男性的候選人早在活動競選了；但是對女性候選人的競選活動却毫無報道。諾登夫人曾經憤慨的說：「女子不願投女子的票」。眞是一語說盡了美國婦女的錯覺。上海眞要坍了！  陳偉　　俗語說：上海灘，眞要上海「坍」了！　　當然，經濟破產，教育破產，文化衰落，貨幣貶價及其他的不景氣，常常被人稱爲「上海坍」。事實上，上海的地面的確是在坍下去。　　在春末到秋季這一個階段中，上海衹要下半小時的驟雨Shower，各地的馬路上都要有積水nood的現象，到處一片澤國，上海一躍而爲陸地「上」地「海」洋。尤其顯著的是滬西，日昇樓一帶，窿坡賽路·馬浪路，蒲石路等。　　一部份是溝渠的過分狹小，水滿出口處沒有潮門或已毀，及河浜的積塞，都是最大的原因。實際上，爲了都市上房子造的太高，而致陸沉，也是重大要素。因爲按照地質方面的趨勢，沿海的土地以冲積者爲多，土質柔軟，容易往下沉。像上海的土地，水門汀馬路之下，都是粘土和砂土，二百五十呎以下方才是砂石層。　　以前工部局工務處長克拉克曾經研究過，在一九二〇到一九四〇年之間，雖只有念年，上海地面已經早已向下沉了二呎。杞人之憂的先生們或者在恐怖，這可不得了，幾百年後，這一批大好都市，又要滄海桑田一下，變成了海市蜃樓。　　以前的大同大學工木工程系教授，現任工務局溝渠工程處總工程司顧康樂先生曾經宣佈過：蒲石路十三層樓，造了僅有十九年，共高一百六十呎，但是直到現在，下沉了六呎之多，則五百零六年後，大人先生們即使高坐十三層樓屋頂上，也難免沒頂了。火險  良　　一個人買了幾百枝價值很昂貴的雪茄烟，然而去保了火險。後來，他把那些雪茄烟都吸完了，他就要求賠償，因爲那些雪茄烟是被火所燒完的，保險公司拒絕賠償。他便去控訴，法官以爲保險公司既然答應雪茄可以保火險，并且手續完備，當然公司方面應該負起經濟的責任來。　　當那個人收到了賠償費之後，公司方面居然也想到報復的辦法，而把他拘捕了，控告他放火。尷尬  春良　　在火車上，史密斯先生注意到一個人傷風得很厲害，便和他攀談了。「你在傷風呢，是嗎？　　那人點點頭。　　「你有沒有自己在應付着這毛病呀？」　　那人用手帕揩掉了鼻涕，搖搖頭。　　史密斯先生就給了一些很好的忠告。「世界上對於傷風一件最好的事是水。儘量的喝水。早晨用鹽湯嗽喉，晚上喝一些燙熱的酒，沒有多少時候，你就會痊癒的……」　　在旅程將要終止時，史密斯先生走近了他的病人問，「啊，我想我們應該互相自我介紹一下。我是史密斯。」　　那個人便和他握手着說，「我是威廉。梅·醫生。」寓言世界末日  藍戈　　美國XX地方，那裏是原子彈製造的大本營，爲了防衛並保持第三次世界大戰的優勝權，美國所有的科學家們日夜在加緊著原子彈製造的生產率。一只，二只，簡直有數十百只原子彈已製成而安排在他們地下的製造室裏。這當然足以使他們壯胆並且藐視世界了。他們的人民高視闊步在原子彈地下製造室的上面。　　但是不幸的事變發生了，在X一個世界的末日裏，美國地下的原子彈製造室突然炸裂了。這慘酷的突變，不僅使全美國炸毀了五分之四，而且由於原子彈輻射能的散射，在極短暫的時間裏使全世界男子的生殖機構全部毀壞了。　　這是一個多麼嚴謹的問題啊。全世界的男子都毀壞了他們的生殖機構，對於生育的問題，不是就此都完結了。雖然全世界還有不少人活著，但是他們都已沒有了生殖機構，不能再生育第二代。所能活者，只有現存這一代，等到這一代都傷老病死，這世界就沒有人類存在了。　　可是新的希望又發現了。在這絕望的當口，美國人民突然發現一個少女懷著孕，這使他們都驚奋得瘋狂起來。他們問這個少女怎麼會懷孕的，那少女告訴他們說：「這是我的丈夫所給予我的！」這使他們更驚奇起來，他們想全世界的男子都已失去了他們的生殖力，怎麼還能替一個少女生育？　　但是他們終於找著那個男子，經過全美國人的盤問，那男子終於說明了他所以能生育的原因，他說：「當原子彈爆炸的當兒，我正在一個極深的礦穴裏工作，而這礦也許是能抵制原子彈所發射的輻射力的！」　　這消息傳出去，使全世界的人民都瘋狂了。各國都派了代表到美國去交涉關於這一個「人」的問題，他們都提出理由，說這人應該由那一國或那一個民族「保管」。因爲這問題是太嚴重了，非但是關係到一國的人民，而且是關係到全世界人類的。　　終於，這一個因特別的機緣而能保存生殖力的男子便成了此後各國政治軍事門爭的中心。因爲，這一個男子非但是一國之賓，而且是全世界之賓啊。……人鬼都鬧房荒　陰間居亦不易  碧翁　　這個年頭兒，因爲做人必定要住房子，人多於屋，才鬧房荒。但是做了鬼，照例自由自在，誰都奈何他不了。可是他的臭皮囊，雖然簡單，也得要一個安置的地方。上海因爲這幾年裏，人多鬼也多活人鬧房荒，鬼也未嘗不是。殯儀舘天天客滿，寄棺材的丙舍·就是疊起來，也感到不能再事容納。所以鬼也再鬧屋荒。不過鬼還有一個去處，便是入土爲安的墳墓。但是屋價貴，地價也未嘗不漲，以前一個墳墓，獨佔了幾畝地的浪費排場，現在固然很少。大家經濟節約，動着公墓的腦筋，於是四郊的公墓，勃然以興。寥寥佳城，好像陽世新造的新村。赤貧的人，自然無力顧問。可是小資產階級，對於這個新村，也覺得不敢問津。這個例子就是等於公墓的葬穴，也不是普通市民所能担負的一樣。按查公墓的章程，一個葬穴，恰恰只能容納一具棺材。這們桐棺六尺之地，原來收費六萬元的，現在却要突漲十萬，連原價需十六萬元一穴。理由是百物飛漲，地價也跟蹤上漲之故。但是諸位得注意，這個價目還是衛生局，業已搬定的限價，並非黑市行情。倘使經濟寬裕的人，預備要囤一些墓穴的話，似乎還是當口。逆料不久將來，人越死越多，地愈葬愈少，一定要像活人房屋一般，用金條來做挖費的。　補白  寗　　　當社魯門就任總統時，美國國民的一般反響是「天哪！」　後他的堅定的姿態和迅捷的行動，使他的信譽得以飛昇九霄。他就職後不過幾個月，美國有名蓋洛普民意測驗指出，有百分之八十七的人民是贊成他的政策的。這樣高的指數，即使故羅斯福總統也從未獲得過，但是上週最近一次的蓋洛普測驗中，形勢激變了，杜魯門的擁護者跌到了百分之卅二。生活指數　滬杭巧妙不同  予徳　　關於十月份工人生活指數，廿九日申報本埠版記載上海市政府已公布爲五二一·八五五·六七，較上月份增加百分之五·〇六·同日經濟版載杭州市工人生活指數，亦經浙江省社會處發表爲六二，九七二，二三，較上月份增加百分之廿一·因此，上海人很奇怪：「爲什麼杭州的生活費用居然比上海高，生活指數相差一千倍？」據不少旅滬的杭州人說，「熱昏！生活費用上海高得多，或許是杭州算法不同？還是上海有意壓低？」還有一般工友們說：「還是託人介紹到杭州做工去吧！那邊米糧房租小菜都比上海便宜得多啦！」我以爲生活指數杭州比上海高出一千倍，並非誰算錯，或許是「戲法人人會變，巧妙各有不同」罷了。　　上海內幕舞女及舞廳　2  嘉謨　　　可是進舞場究竟不是那麼簡單的事，還得有時髦的衣裳穿，以及燙髮，美容等。這就需要一筆開辨費。於是從前樓嫂嫂，鄰家阿姨那邊東拼西湊，或是像正做舞女的小姊妹借些錢，總算草草可以應付了。於是進場，開始她們生命史上的第一課了。　　在小舞場裏，什麼都不成樣。場內設備的簡陋，樂隊的窺敗，舞客羣的低級與鄙俗，樣樣都一無足道。衹有鈔票還是一樣的鈔票，一樣可以買米買柴，還債之外，還好養家活口。鈔票眞是件好東西，她使那些初生長中的小舞女們握在手裏，使她們開始相信自身確是有能力賺錢的了。這是她們平日夢想不到的花花綠綠的鈔票，現在是每日或每週間可以賺進來。即使她們的跳舞步伐還是凌亂而不合節拍。即使她們並不是怎樣動人的美女，可是她們同樣可以得到進款。這是值得喜悅的事。——當然——進款的相差數有時是很大的。　　高昇　在小舞場裏混上了一年半載，門路也混熟了。她們結識的女朋友比前更多，而且也多少有些舞客和她們很熟悉。在這期間，她們儘有機會到三等二等或是頭等舞廳去觀光過。一切都比小舞廳大，而且像階梯一般地，偉大之上還有更偉大的。於是她們的芳心便活躍了。「我爲什麼不可以到那種較好的舞場去做呢？」她們都互相私議着。她們應該「得新棄舊」，不，這叫做「良禽擇木而棲」。自然她們都情願做良禽，衹要身段相當，姿色不差的女流。她們不久便都升遷到二三等的舞場去了。　　反正每個舞場跟舞女都沒有從前那種「合同」]可以束縛她們。說滾就滾。而且小姊妹一致行動，以便互相照應。可是無論是怎麼美貌的舞女，要由小舞場一躍而跑上頭等舞廳也是辦不到的事。「向上爬」哲學固然是對，可是一下子爬得高也躓得重。第一是年齡太青，究竟還都是黃毛丫頭，不是「高等華人」的舞客所看得對勁的。第二是舞術欲其求精，仍舊頗需時日的磨練。第三是談吐應酬功力不足，不能拉得住頭等舞客。第四是衣服裝飾都須有充分的準備，究竟限於收入，還不足以談排場。第五是沒有兜得轉的闊老撐腰，別說憑靠勢力活動，最怕生意維持不下去，反而有失面子。至少須在二三等舞場裏混過三年以上，方才有踏進頭等舞場的可能。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Chairman Goes to the Suburbs of Wuxi for his Birthday, a Short Trip to Taihu Lake and Returns to Nanjing the Same Evening, Accompanied by his Wife and the Marshall Couple</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] Today marks the joyful occasion of Chairman's sixtieth birthday, the entire country celebrates and offers congratulations. The Chairman decided on the eve to leave Nanjing to avoid the birthday celebrations, originally planning to go to Xikou, but later changed it to a trip to Wuxi. After getting up early in the morning, he and his wife held prayers, which lasted slightly longer than usual. After that, they had breakfast together, and then drove with his wife to the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Station at Hepingmen, arriving at 9:00 AM. The four special carriages, specially attached, had been prepared as early as 7:00 AM. Before long, Special Envoy Marshall and his wife, along with Mr. Luce, also arrived. Special Envoy Marshall stepped forward to offer birthday greetings and presented a new-style phonograph. The Chairman gladly accepted it and then boarded the train. This newspaper's reporter accompanied them in another carriage. This morning, the capital's weather was unfortunately thick with fog, but after the train started, the moon gradually appeared, and the autumn sky in the countryside was clear and bright. A moment later, the golden and glorious sunlight shone over the earth, sweeping away the fog. The Chairman immediately tried out the new phonograph in the carriage to entertain the guests. At 12:20 PM, the train arrived in Wuxi. After getting off the train, they went directly to the Liyuan Garden on Dushan Mountain for sightseeing and took a wooden boat to tour the lake. At that time, the lake was shimmering with light and shadows, and the seventy-two peaks of the East and West Dongting Mountains stood majestically. The scenery was beautiful and full of ever-changing sights. The Chairman felt very happy. At the train station, the people lined up in long rows, with firecrackers bursting and cheering incessantly. After the Chairman boarded the train, the people continued to cheer enthusiastically, and the Chairman waved to show his appreciation. At 5:10 PM, the train departed. At 8:40 PM, it arrived at Hepingmen Station. After a short rest, at 8:50 PM, the Chairman and Special Envoy Marshall's wife were the first to get off the train and boarded car number 1982. Then, the attendants took down the five-pound cake covered with small red candles, offered by the people of Wuxi, as well as other items. Five minutes later, the wife and Special Envoy Marshall, along with Mr. Luce, got off the train. The wife and Special Envoy Marshall rode in the same car and left the station to return to the official residence. Today, the Chairman wore a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, while the wife wore a black Western-style suit and trousers, with white pearl earrings, and a wide-brimmed straw hat outdoors.

<h3>Various Proposals from Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles to Rescue the Crisis; The Executive Yuan Responds Item by Item; Labor Issues Responded to by the Ministry of Social Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, in view of the various influences on our country's industry and commerce, such as prices, transportation, and the smooth sale of foreign goods, which has led to a crisis, sent representatives to Beijing on August 13th of this year to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Executive Yuan, which read: "Regarding the various proposals submitted by the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis, it was approved on October 7th with the Jing San character No. 14916, and distributed to the relevant departments for the record. Now, according to the review of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this case has been invited to gather relevant agencies to order consultation on the main points of the original request, compiled a meeting record, except for labor issues, which have been directly answered by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the remaining items, and on the supplementary opinions of various agencies, the original meeting record has been revised, along with the revised record, please review, etc.; It is noted that the opinions proposed in the revised record are still appropriate, of which the second item on the issue of the existence of the Four Joint Offices, seems to be unnecessary to discuss at present, the fifth item (3), regarding the type of import, and restrictions, has been sent to the Import Design Committee for careful research, and the same first item (6), regarding the barter policy, should be actively prepared, has been ordered by the Central Trust Bureau to consider, the seventh item, regarding the inland river shipping relief issue, has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to reply with a special case."</p>
<p>Decision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs</p>
<p>The following is the resolution of the meeting convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on August 29th to gather relevant agencies for joint discussion: (1) Production Loans and Industrial Loans (including amount, interest rate, and simplified procedures, etc.): (1) Amount - The government is in the process of handling various production loans one after another. The amount is also gradually increasing, without any restrictions. (2) Purpose - Limited to being used as necessary working capital for production enterprises. The fixed capital required for expansion of various factories must be raised through stock issuance and cannot rely on loans. (3) Nature of the enterprise - Loans will be granted to those who have hope of production, which can not only increase production but also help the development of the enterprise. Even if loans are granted to those who have no hope, it is difficult to expect success. Therefore, the approval of production loans must be decided separately for each production enterprise. (4) Interest rate - National banks have always adopted a low-interest policy and are continuing to do so in order to reduce the burden on merchants and the people. (5) Collateral - The collateral for loans from national banks has always been mainly raw materials and finished products, and there are restrictions on the period of acceptance. Now, the Four Joint Offices have approved a flexible approach, and the machinery owned by manufacturers can also be provided as part of the collateral in order to strengthen assistance to the development of production enterprises. For industrial and mining enterprises that are well-organized and have excellent operating results, national banks can also participate in investment or provide other guidance and assistance. (6) Simplified procedures - The Four Joint Offices have paid close attention to this issue, and recently passed various business regulations, which have been improved compared to the past. (2) Issue of the Existence and Abolition of the Four Joint Offices and the Specialization of Banks: Resolution: The issue of the existence and abolition of the Four Joint Offices is not convenient for the Ministry and other departments to discuss. As for the specialization of banks, it has actually been implemented long ago, and there is no need to discuss it further. (3) Issue of Organizing the Revival Industrial Investment Company: Resolution: In principle, it is feasible, but the issue involves many aspects and still needs to be carefully considered by the competent department. (4) Exchange Rate: Resolution: It has recently been adjusted and does not need to be discussed further. (5) Import and Export Taxes, Import and Export Chain System, Subsidy Policy, Barter Policy, etc.: Resolution: (1) Import tariffs are being researched and prepared for revision. (2) The government has recently decided to temporarily exempt export taxes uniformly. (3) The types and restrictions of imported goods are to be requested from the Executive Yuan to transfer to the Import Design Committee for careful research and appropriate revisions. (4) The import speed lock system is quite problematic in terms of implementation technology, and the exchange rate has just been adjusted, so it will not be discussed. (5) Export subsidy policy, export tax has been exempted, and the exchange rate has also been raised, so it will be discussed later. (6) The loan policy should be actively planned and implemented for several countries. (7) Smuggling of import loans should be strictly prohibited. (6) Issue of Compensation and Preferential Treatment for Losses of Re-employed Factories: Resolution: Regarding the compensation for losses of factories during the War of Resistance, the Executive Yuan has established a Compensation Committee, and the losses of various factories can be reported in accordance with the regulations and submitted to the enemy for compensation; as for preferential treatment measures, the second round of bidding for the sale of enemy and puppet factories that Zhu Neng sold has recently been formulated, and the re-employed factories in the rear area have priority in purchasing or leasing. The various factories can apply in accordance with the regulations. (7) Issue of Relief for Inland River Shipping: Resolution: This case is purely an issue of relief for the transportation industry and will be reviewed directly by the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<h3>Veteran Traitor Yin Rugeng Sentenced to Death for Double Crimes; Former Beiping Mayor Liu Yushu Sentenced to Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] The Capital High Court sentenced veteran North China traitor Yin Rugeng to life imprisonment and the death penalty on the 31st. At 5:30 PM, Presiding Judge Jin Shiding, along with Judges Wang Hongquan and Shentu Chen, and Prosecutor He Zhongjin, raised the court and brought Yin traitor to the court. After briefly questioning his age and origin, he announced the criminal acts committed by Yin traitor, which should be handled in two stages: (1) During the period before the July 7th Incident when he organized the puppet Jidong Autonomous Government, the crime committed was the crime of internal turmoil under the ordinary criminal law, and the commutation law can be applied. The main text of the judgment was: "Yin Rugeng conspired to change the state system, usurped the national territory, and first initiated the riot, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of public rights for life." (2) After the July 7th Incident, he took up a puppet post. The crime committed was the Special Criminal Law for Punishing Traitors. The main text of the judgment was: "Yin Rugeng colluded with the enemy country to conspire to resist this country, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property, except for a reasonable amount for family living expenses, will be confiscated."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Opening of the National Federation of Commerce</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce, which has been in preparation for many years, opened today in the capital. At a time when economic construction needs to be stepped up and the industrial and commercial crisis in various places is gradually deepening, the establishment of the National Federation of Commerce in the capital at this time allows the central authorities and all sectors of the country to hear the urgent voices of industrial and commercial people, and its significance is not comparable to ordinary times.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, all the proposals and reports of the inaugural meeting of the National Federation of Commerce have not yet been seen, and it is not possible to speculate on where the focus is. But in addition to wishing the National Federation of Commerce success, we believe that the conference really needs to pay attention to the following points.</p>
<p>First, how should the industrial and commercial crisis be rescued? This issue is expected to be one of the main topics in this meeting. Perhaps some people think that the formation of the "crisis" has psychological factors in it. The more you think about the crisis, the more the crisis seems to be pressing, and the result is a false alarm, just disturbing yourself. Therefore, it is advocated that there is no need to exaggerate the crisis. There may be some reason for this, but it cannot be used to adopt an ostrich policy, ignore the crisis too much, and wait for death. In any case, today no one would believe that there is no crisis in industry and commerce. Speaking of Shanghai, we feel that the points of petition submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Council have pointed out the crux of the crisis, and are also quite succinct. However, some parts are still biased towards the local area, and the general national problems need to be supplemented or corrected by this National Federation of Commerce. Due to the vast territory of our country and the wide range of products, the economic situation in various places is certainly not necessarily the same. To give an example: the industrial circles in this port are eagerly awaiting the aid of foreign raw materials, while domestic raw materials such as tobacco, cotton, wheat, and soybeans are suffering from the inability to transport and sell them for various reasons, and are looking for other ways out, or the price is too different, and the merchants and manufacturers have not been able to obtain harmonious cooperation. The National Federation of Commerce is the general meeting of economic units in various places, and should be able to coordinate the overall situation and formulate a more advanced general plan to resolve the crisis for the selection of all parties.</p>
<p>In rescuing the industrial and commercial crisis, we have always believed that the biggest premise is the degree of understanding, and the choice of which plan is secondary. Because with a clear understanding, effective plans can be generated. Plans are plans, and promotion relies on strength. If the strength is insufficient, the plan is still empty words. Therefore, the National Federation of Commerce has a dual responsibility for this issue: one is to formulate a more complete plan, and the other is to effectively urge all parties to work hard to implement it.</p>
<p>Second, what kind of policy should be adopted for economic construction? The issue of the boundary between state-owned and private, the issue of industrial focus and the equal emphasis on agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the issue of free trade and the use of protection policies, seem to have been decided by the central government, but the opinions of the people are not entirely consistent. In this meeting, there should be many suggestions for discussion. We believe that any construction must be carried out in a relatively stable state in order to progress in an orderly manner and achieve results day by day. The biggest obstacle in the economic world now is the instability, which makes all parties busy with the current response and unable to start with fundamental construction. The reasons for this are complex, some are due to social, economic, and some are due to political and military reasons. The National Federation of Commerce is the general group of the national economic world, and its representatives are freely elected by the chambers of commerce in various places. It can also be said to be the most democratic general group of the national economic world. If there is a so-called "third party", then this representative of national industry and commerce, who is truly elected, is more worthy of it than politicians. At this turning point in the current situation, we hope that they will exert the power of democracy, provide true public opinion, strive to uphold justice, clearly distinguish between right and wrong, and judge the truth, end the turbulent situation, and promote economic construction. Because if military and political affairs are well managed, social and economic affairs will naturally be well managed. Aren't the current problems of transportation, prices, currency, unemployment, and lack of supplies obviously affected by military and political affairs?</p>
<p>Third, it seems worthwhile to examine the problems of the industrial and commercial circles themselves. Before the War of Resistance, the government lacked certainty and constructiveness in its economic policies, which is undeniable. In addition, the shackles of unequal treaties, agreed tariffs, consular jurisdiction, and concession areas everywhere were obstacles, which made the industrial and commercial circles struggling and deeply trapped in a scattered, chaotic, and complacent state. This is indeed a major obstacle to economic recovery. Now, on the one hand, we hope that the government will establish economic policies, and at the same time, we also hope that the general industrial and commercial circles will recognize the times and be able to cooperate with this national policy. There must be mutual support and practical cooperation between the upper and lower levels, so that all kinds of economic policies can be promoted to their full advantage. Taking Shanghai as an example: recently, various allocation methods have not achieved the desired results. There are naturally many reasons for this, and the fact that merchants are adhering to past habits and overemphasizing their own interests is certainly one of the main reasons. How to change the atmosphere and change the style in the future, so that officials and the people can stand on the same line, promote the country's established policies, and work together for economic recovery, we believe that this is not a one-sided responsibility of the authorities, nor is it a one-sided matter for merchants. Harmonizing the upper and lower levels, uniting as one, and moving towards the great road of economic recovery together, this is a common awareness that everyone must have. The representatives of the National Federation of Commerce come from all over the country, and they can see and hear more clearly. They will surely identify the goals and complete the important mission they are entrusted with.</p>
<p>Here, we wish the National Federation of Commerce success!</p>

<h3>Jiangsu's Land Tax Collection in Kind: Approved to Collect at 40% Plus a Grain Reserve, and Can Be Changed to Wheat or Cotton Depending on Local Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 31st Dispatch] Chen Chun, Deputy Director of the Suzhou Land Grain Office, received our reporter on the afternoon of the 31st and gave a comprehensive talk on the issue of land tax collection in kind: This year's land tax collection in kind and borrowing was originally stipulated by the central government that those who paid one yuan of tax during the war should be changed to three shi dou of rice grain, plus one dou of borrowing, plus nine sheng of public grain, totaling four dou and nine sheng. Now, the provincial government and the provincial council, believing that the tenant farmers in Jiangsu Province suffered too much during the war and the tax amount was too heavy, repeatedly submitted requests for reduction, which was approved by the central government to collect 40% in kind. The equivalent of one yuan of tax is 1.96 dou of rice grain, plus a 10% grain reserve. Therefore, today the fixed amount of land tax in Jiangsu Province is the lightest in the country, and the actual production situation in various places can be referred to again to determine the collection of barley, wheat, cotton, etc. The conversion standard is: collecting wheat, each yuan of tax is equal to 1.362 dou of wheat; collecting cotton, 1.08 sheng is equal to one zu of grain, and 1.05 sheng is equal to one shi of wheat. As for the tax rate per mu, it depends on the amount of output, and is divided into four grades and twelve levels. The most fertile land has a tax rate of 1.23 yuan per mu, and the least fertile land has a tax rate of only 0.12 yuan per mu, all converted into real objects for collection according to the grade. The reporter then asked about the repayment method of the borrowed part, and Chen replied: the central government has stipulated that no additional food coupons will be issued, and from the 40th year of the Republic of China, the land tax will be offset evenly over five years, or the real objects will be repaid evenly, but no interest will be calculated. Chen also stated that the work of collecting real objects in Wuxian County will officially begin on November 1st and is scheduled to be completed by December 15th. If all of them can be collected, it will be possible to obtain a total of more than 350,000 dan of grain. In order to reduce the transportation and consumption burden of tenant farmers due to tax payment, this office, according to the provincial measures, can mobilize the village chiefs to organize collective grain payment. The unit is the village, and the grain will be collected regularly. The village chief will lead and supervise the delivery of grain to the warehouse to show condolence.</p>

Personnel have also been selected and sent to Xiao, Pi, Suining, Pei and Huaisi to establish public treasuries first, and plan to restore the original institutions in the counties to maintain local finances.

The Hangzhou High Procuratorate sent two bailiffs with a letter to Shanghai to take him into custody. Unexpectedly, on the 29th, while taking the express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, the traitor claimed to need to use the restroom while passing through the town of Xiashi in this county. The bailiffs escorted him to the restroom. When the train left Xiashi station, about three or four li away from the station, he smashed the window and jumped out of the train. At that time, the train was moving fast. The bailiffs only saw the traitor crawling on the ground, seemingly injured. They urgently asked to stop the train, but were unsuccessful. They were unable to pursue him. They got off the train at Chang'an station and then rushed back to Xiashi, where they joined eight policemen from the police局 and went to the scene of the incident to search, but found nothing. The county government has now joined forces with the police局 and the district court to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Gunfire in Baiyang Bay Indicates… Self-Defense Corps Ambush Lake Bandits, Destroy Bandit Boat, Intercept Large Batch of Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Suzhou dispatch] Muli Township in the Fifth District of this county borders Taihu Lake and has always been a place where lake bandits run rampant. In recent months, with the gradual advancement of the suppression work, the bandits' power has been slightly curbed. At around 10 am on the 28th, members of the defense sentry of the township's Self-Defense Corps suddenly discovered four bandit boats in Baiyang Bay in Taihu Lake. It was estimated that there were about 40 bandits, carrying new weapons such as light machine guns. They focused their fire on a motorboat, and one of the bandit boats seemed to be trying to dock, clearly intending to loot local villages. The defense sentry members immediately fired their guns to warn the police, gathered all the members, and rushed to the lakeside to intercept them. At the same time, they covered the motorboat to escape. Later, the self-defense corps from Hengjing, Qianzhuang, Xishang, and other places received the news and set out to encircle and suppress the bandits. They destroyed one bandit boat on the spot. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits quickly abandoned the broken boat and fled into the center of the lake. Later, the Xishang Self-Defense Corps managed to intercept the broken boat. They found a large number of stolen goods in the bandit boat, including gold rings, watches, clothes, and cloth, as well as 40 sets of military uniforms.</p>

The remaining confiscated guns have been collected, awaiting further arrangements. It is now known that Township Head Zhou has escaped safely and returned.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Purchases by Outside Merchants Drive Up Wuhu Rice Prices</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Wuhu dispatch] Wuhu rice prices have been stable since the autumn harvest. However, recently, a certain Shanghai enterprise company, which originally dealt in flour and cloth and sold goods to both the north and south, has been prohibited from exporting and has used its surplus funds to explore the purchase of large quantities of rice in Wuhu. In addition, trade companies from Tianjin, Quanzhou, and Zhongjiang have also sent personnel to Wuhu to collect rice. There are a total of six iron boats moored on the river, which can also transport more than 100,000 bags of rice. As a result, rice prices have soared by more than 10,000 yuan per dan in the past two days. The current price of top-grade machine-milled rice has reached 52,000 yuan, and the price of top-grade cooked rice has reached 47,000 to 48,000 yuan, which is an unprecedented phenomenon since the autumn harvest.</p>
<h3>Jinhua Strictly Prohibits Bullfighting</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Jinhua dispatch] The practice of bullfighting is very popular in various townships in this county.

<h3>Decline of Silk Industry Affects Mulberry Tree Growers; 3,000 Mu of Seedlings Have No Way Out; China Silk Corporation Discusses Relief in Chang'an</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Haining dispatch] The mulberry seedlings produced in more than 20 villages and towns in Zhouwangmiao, Chang'an in this county, and the borders of Chongde, Tongxiang, and Hangxian are the main production areas in our country and have a great impact on the lives of farmers. The China Silk Corporation, in view of this, established a seedling cultivation guidance center in Chang'an this spring, and the China Farmers Bank provided mulberry seedling loans. During the sowing season, the company also issued a bonus of 6,000 yuan per mu to encourage farmers to plant and restore mulberry seedlings. It is estimated that 3,000 mu have been planted, which can produce about 8,000 dan of seedlings and 120 million branches. However, due to the current slump in the silk industry, they cannot be sold and have no ability to transplant them in large quantities, so there is panic. The China Silk Corporation specially invited more than 10 representatives from relevant parties in Chang'an to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to promote publicity as much as possible, encourage planting, and plan to set the price of seedlings at 60,000 yuan per dan, and transfer it to the Farmers Bank to continue to handle loans, requiring a total loan of about 1 billion yuan. It was decided to purchase about 2 million branches of grafted seedlings that can be planted. However, if the more than 100 million seedlings that require 20,000 mu of land cannot be completely resolved, then the more than 3,000 mu of mulberry seedlings will have no way out, which will affect the future of sericulture.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union's Disarmament Proposal Decided to Be Included in the General Assembly Agenda; Austin Responds to Soviet Challenge Speech</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: The United Nations General Assembly made amazing progress today. The Steering Committee of 14 countries unanimously approved that the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal be placed on the General Assembly agenda. The General Assembly Bulletin stated: This proposal has been submitted to the Political Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 31st Broadcasting New York News: The United Nations General Assembly held its last plenary meeting today. The only speakers scheduled to give speeches were representatives from Uruguay, Luxembourg, and Ukraine.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Telegram] The United States today expressed its support for the Soviet Union's proposal for universal world disarmament, which was put forward at the United Nations General Assembly. However, the United States went further, advocating the establishment of an international inspection system to ensure genuine disarmament. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov only proposed four plans at the General Assembly last night and did not mention supervision. US Chief Representative Austin gave a speech at the General Assembly today and launched a counterattack against Molotov's challenge.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 30th Telegram] US Chief Representative Austin gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly today, stating that the United States is prepared to fully cooperate with other United Nations member states to implement disarmament and announce the number of its troops stationed in foreign territories. The main points he stated are as follows: (1) The United States is prepared to fully cooperate with other United Nations member states to reduce armaments, and the United States also advocates proposing safeguards to protect the parties who comply with the treaty and to resist possible violations or evasions of the disarmament agreement; (2) The United States is prepared to fully announce the number of its troops stationed in foreign territories. As for the proposed inspection of armaments, it should include all troops in a state of mobilization at home and abroad; (3) Regarding the veto issue, the United States believes that the principle of adopting consistent opinions on major events can reflect the facts of today's world; (4) There is room for improvement in the activities of the Security Council, and when using voting methods, actions that violate the original intent of the Charter should be avoided as much as possible. Austin said that Molotov's speech yesterday seemed to contain distrust and misunderstanding of the motives of the United States. I do not believe that mutual accusations between allies can promote the realization of unity. During the war, we did our best to provide allies with assistance and cooperation, and in peacetime, the United States should also support United Nations institutions. Our motives in war and peace can be left to historical judgment. We fought side by side in wartime and did not insult each other. Why not do the same in peacetime? Therefore, I will not participate in any accusatory behavior. We deeply welcome Molotov's expression of trust in countries to establish a unanimous agreement. Regarding the issue of disarmament, Austin said that the United States believes that this matter should be included on the agenda for discussion. The Soviet Union has strong military power, and it is appropriate to propose this proposal, just as the United States' proposal to prevent the manufacture and use of atomic bombs is equally appropriate. After the First World War, our unilateral disarmament was a mistake. We must not allow this mistake to be repeated today. To complete disarmament, we must take positive action to establish a postwar state of peace.</p>
<h3>The Thorny Issue of Spain; The Security Council Revisits the Past; Poland Demands Cancellation for Transfer to the General Assembly for Discussion; Soviet Foreign Minister Attends Meeting for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 31st Broadcasting: The Spanish issue has been unanimously resolved to be temporarily recorded on the General Assembly agenda. Before this matter is submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, it will be handed over to the Political Committee for processing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Special Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council met this afternoon, and Molotov attended for the first time representing the Soviet Union. After the Security Council meeting began, it first considered Switzerland's application to become a member of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. This issue was decided to be submitted to the Special Committee for review without debate. When the meeting was about to adjourn, the Polish representative suddenly suggested in a calm manner that the Security Council cancel the Spanish issue, which is still on its agenda. Lanchi requested that the Security Council, in view of the strong interest that the General Assembly had already expressed in debating the Spanish issue, take the necessary actions to enable the General Assembly to obtain this right because Article 12 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that when the Security Council is executing the functions conferred upon it by this Charter with respect to any dispute or situation, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with respect to that dispute or situation unless requested by the Security Council. After Lanchi made the suggestion, there was a commotion at the meeting for a while. Molotov agreed to discuss the proposal immediately, but the Egyptian representative suggested that this issue should be submitted to the Security Council through normal channels, that is, the issue must be submitted to the agenda three days in advance. The Brazilian representative expressed his support, and the Security Council decided to convene a special meeting on the 4th of next month to discuss the requirements put forward by Poland.</p>
<h3>Albania Accuses Britain of Violating Territorial Waters; Britain Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th Telegram] A British Foreign Office spokesperson said: Albania's accusation that British warships had intruded into Albanian territorial waters was obviously inappropriate. The warships HMS Saumarez and HMS Volage touched mines on October 22 in the Strait of Corfu, which is very narrow. Ships must intrude into the territorial waters of nearby countries in order to pass through, so international law has always recognized it as a highway for international transportation. In other words, international ships can make a bona fide harmless passage there.</p>
<p>President Truman Gave a Speech on the Opening Day of the United Nations General Assembly; The Venue Was Crowded (United Press Wireless Transceiver)</p>
<h3>Obey Justice and Reason to Resolve International Disputes: Truman Reaffirms U.S. Beliefs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: President Truman wrote to the New York Herald Tribune today: "The representatives of various countries in the United Nations General Assembly are all striving to strengthen the understanding between countries. They represent the governments of various countries, just like members of Congress represent various parties and factions, so their opinions cannot go beyond the scope of the instructions of their respective governments. If we want to make countries understand each other, we must first explore the root causes of international disputes. We cannot force others to agree with our beliefs, nor will we allow others to force us to agree with their beliefs, but we can offer our beliefs for the test of justice and reason, and at the same time, we can ask others to offer their beliefs for the same test. None of us can surrender to force, but all people must obey justice and reason."</p>
<h3>Wallace Accuses U.S. Diplomacy Toward the Soviet Union of Leading Down the Path of War</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace said in a speech at the People's Party election rally: "Bernstein was encouraged by Vandenberg, Connally, and the Army to introduce the danger of war against the Soviet Union. He said that the US naval aircraft in Greek airspace certainly did not believe in Bernstein. At the same time, we do not believe that the United States' demand to occupy the Ball Islands, thus threatening the Soviet Union's access to the ocean, is based on the claims of members. If there is no leading line for Vanderberg and the Army, Bernstein and the State Department will not take the risk of leaving the danger of war with the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Refutes Soviet Foreign Minister's Remarks in Strong Language</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: General Eisenhower expressed his opinion in the New York Herald Tribune today, refuting Molotov's speech at the United Nations General Assembly the other day. Eisenhower said that it is absurd to say that the United States is threatening other countries. The number of U.S. troops currently stationed abroad is decreasing daily, which is bound to arouse other countries' covetousness of the United States.</p>
<h3>Allied Dependence of the United States and Britain - Weapon Standardization - British Plan Takes Ten Years to Complete - US Uses New Zealand and Australia as Forward Base in the Pacific</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] The British military has drafted an ambitious plan to standardize its equipment, aligning it with the sizes and types of American ordnance. The rifle models used will be completely redesigned, as will ten-day cannons, field guns, fighter planes, and naval guns.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] British military officials announced that British and American military and political authorities have agreed on methods for standardizing the weapons and ammunition of the British army, navy, and air force to match American weaponry. Since the end of the war a year ago, the US and Britain have continuously exchanged information and studied this matter. The United States and Britain now have a close relationship of allied dependence, with no more individual military secrets. The establishment of a dedicated British Ministry of Defence is also related to this. The issue of weapon standardization was initially raised by the Canadian Prime Minister during the United Kingdom conference in April. At that time, Mr. King stated that Canada firmly believes that its territorial integrity and future security are inextricably linked to the United States. Therefore, defense strategies must take into account American production and scientific resources. However, there was no formal decision made during the five-nation conference. Prime Minister Attlee immediately conducted research with military authorities and subsequently delegated the matter to the British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff for further specific discussions, and an agreement was reached. According to the agreement, Britain will be able to order most of its military supplies from the United States in times of emergency, avoiding the difficulties encountered in the past. The United States will use British arsenals established in New Zealand, Australia, and other places as forward bases. It will take Britain ten years to complete this plan.</p>
<h3>Strong Dissatisfaction among Our Overseas Chinese Merchants with Dutch East Indies Authorities' Interference</h3>
<p>Anglo-Dutch Indian Authorities Begin Political Negotiations</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 30th] Chinese shipowners are deeply dissatisfied with the Dutch authorities' interference in trade in Indonesian ports. Several weeks ago, a ship owned by a Chinese was searched by the Dutch Navy, and a Chinese sailor was shot dead by the Dutch military. The Singapore Chinese Importers and Exporters Association has sent representatives to the Chinese Consulate here to request that they petition the government to negotiate with the Dutch and demand compensation. The Dutch authorities recently announced that all merchant ships sailing into four Indonesian ports should be inspected, and even if the goods on board have paid local taxes, they must still be subject to heavy taxes by the Dutch. The overseas Chinese are extremely angry at this action by the Dutch.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 30th] Representatives from Britain, India, and the Netherlands met today and decided to start political negotiations on Friday to discuss the future status of Indonesia.</p>
<h3>US B-29 Global Flight Plan - State Department Announces Suspension of Approval - To Avoid Accusations of Adopting a "Big Stick" Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Special Dispatch] The US State Department announced that it has temporarily suspended the approval of the US Army Air Forces' B-29 bomber global flight at the request of the War Department. The US War Department also announced that the delay in this approval is because the State Department believes that this flight may be misunderstood as a demonstration of American military power, even though the authorities have stated that this flight is technical in nature. The Soviet Union may still regard it as another aspect of atomic diplomacy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The US War Department requested the State Department to approve a global flight by a squadron of B-29 Superfortresses. Secretary of State Byrnes is currently considering how to respond to this difficult issue. The State Department believes that the situation is "delicate" because showing off military might at this time will make many parties believe that the United States is rattling its saber and eager to try. The War Department's application was only formally submitted to the State Department yesterday. Some members of the State Department feel that since the end of the war, the Army and Navy departments have repeatedly tried to interfere in the State Department's formulation of US foreign policy, and the State Department is eager to avoid being accused of adopting a "big stick" policy.</p>
<h3>President of the Indian National Congress Talks about Sino-Indian Relations</h3>
<p>Indians View Gandhi as a Deity</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 30th Special Dispatch] The President of the Indian National Congress, Kripalani, stated that he believes that relations between China and India will become closer in the future. Although the leaders of the Congress Party are prepared to assume the responsibilities of government, they still express doubts about Britain's desire to leave India. Judging from recent events across the country, they are still playing old tricks of divide and rule. When asked about criticism of the political situation in China, he stated that regarding the situation in China, if all parties are purely for the benefit of the general public and not for the benefit of special classes, then the domestic conflicts that both China and India are currently facing can be overcome, because the interests of the general public are indeed common and the same. He also stated that in order to promote cultural relations between the two countries, transportation should be made more convenient.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Calcutta, 30th] Gandhi recently traveled from New Delhi to East Bengal to inspect the riot-stricken areas and advised all believers not to crowd around train stations or docks to surround him. Gandhi has always been regarded as a deity by Hindus, and there is a saying among the people that anyone who can see Gandhi's true face will have boundless happiness. Gandhi himself stated that he did not want armed guards to accompany him. The Chief Minister of Bengal, Suhrawardy, met with Gandhi today to discuss the situation in Bengal.</p>

<h3>Puppet Officials Transform Themselves - Actually Become Receiving Officials - Collude with Treacherous Merchants - Conceal Enemy Property - Former Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Municipal Government - Shen Wenyuan Cannot Escape the Net of Justice - District Prosecutor's Office Captures Him and Interrogates Him</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Following the Shanghai Municipal Government's automobile corruption case, the District Prosecutor's Office recently investigated a certain construction factory related to the former General Affairs Office's Vehicle Affairs Section of the Municipal Government for concealing a large amount of enemy property, as well as the former Chief of the Materials Section of the Third War Area Military Supplies Receiving Committee, Lu Shishang, and the Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Shen Wenyuan, on suspicion of abusing power and engaging in corrupt practices. This case was personally reviewed by President Song and transferred to the Ministry of Justice, which forwarded it to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. On October 30th of last year, the Third War Area, based on a tip, stated that a certain construction factory was concealing a large amount of enemy military supplies and dispatched team member Wang Zenglue to lead several soldiers to search the premises at 360 Yanping Road. A total of over six hundred large barrels of kerosene and diesel (50 gallons each), two hundred inner and outer tires for automobiles, thirty "cong" of Monsanto saccharin, a room of foreign tiles, iron hinges, and iron hasps, sixty-five large steel windows, over seventy bundles of bamboo steel bars, and over 50,000 square feet of large foreign pine boards and over fifty "dan" of water flowing iron bars were found. At the time, due to insufficient seals, the items were not sealed and were to be transported to the Third War Area warehouse for storage the following day.</p>
<p>At the same time, the premises at 29 Zhoujia Road were searched, and it was discovered that the previously sealed kerosene and other items were all gone. Wang Zenglue immediately interrogated the factory's accounting staff, who admitted that 2,498 small boxes of kerosene (5 gallons each), 250 large barrels of kerosene (50 gallons each), 95 large barrels of red car oil, and 129 large barrels of diesel had been successively transported away using waybills No. 15953 and No. 15206 from October 23rd to 27th within five days. They also stated that the factory's person in charge had agreed to it with the Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, Shen Wenyuan. On November 1st, when Wang Zenglue led soldiers to 360 Yanping Road again to move the aforementioned materials, someone claiming to be Shen Wenyuan, the Director of the Vehicle Affairs Office of the Municipal Government, stopped the removal with a personal note from Lu Shishang, the Chief of the Materials Section of the Third War Area Receiving Committee, claiming that the materials belonged to the Municipal Government. However, no one was guarding them, nor were they sealed. Based on the above facts, it is clear that the merchant colluded with the receiving officials to conceal enemy property. After receiving instructions on September 20th of this year, the District Prosecutor's Office immediately began investigating. On the 29th of last month, Shen Zhenjia, the first Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Municipal Government after the victory, was summoned for interrogation. It was learned that Shen Wenyuan was the Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Puppet Municipal Government before the victory. After the Municipal Government was taken over, Shen Wenyuan continued to work in the Vehicle Affairs Office. In February of this year, after this case occurred, he resigned. On the same day, the prosecutor ordered Shen Zhenjia to arrest Shen Wenyuan, but Shen Wenyuan had already fled upon hearing the news. After a day and night of investigation by the police, Shen Wenyuan was arrested in a printing house on the morning of the 30th. The prosecutor in charge of the case and the clerk personally went to 360 Yanping Road and other places to inspect the premises on the previous day, and other suspects are being strictly apprehended.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Forms Working Teams - To Supervise Tax Collection in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the method of collecting land taxes by contractors, which was previously monopolized by local maps, has many drawbacks. A special effort is being made to improve it during the land registration process. The bureau has sent seventeen land tax working teams to various districts to handle the matter in conjunction with local Bao and Jia chiefs. The working teams set out on the 26th of last month, each with a team leader and three members. Each working area averages about twelve Bao. The process consists of four stages: publicity, registration, random inspection, and tax collection. The bureau has appointed specialist Zhao Qifeng as the captain of the large team to supervise the process in the countryside. If the work progresses smoothly, it can be completed before January of next spring.</p>

<h3>錢幣司長談　行莊復業條件　設立於抗戰發生以前　確因戰事影響而停業　並有各方面完備證件　七月十五日以前申請</h3>
<p>［This Newspaper's Report］Recently, there has been much confusion regarding the applications for resumption of business by financial institutions (including banks, native banks, trust companies, etc.). Therefore, this reporter specially visited Mr. Dai Mingli, Director of the Monetary Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, who had just returned from visiting relatives in eastern Zhejiang Province, and raised several questions. He kindly provided the following answers: (1) The main conditions for a financial institution to apply for resumption of business are: (A) It must have been established before the outbreak of the war. (B) It must have been forced to suspend business due to the impact of the war. (C) It must have certificates from the local government and chamber of commerce, account statements from correspondent native banks, and tax payment receipts to the government. (2) The deadline for applying for resumption of business was originally set for May 5th of this year. However, due to the vastness of the territory and the enthusiastic response from financial institutions across various regions applying for resumption of business, the deadline was specially extended to July 15th of this year. It is estimated that over 1,500 institutions have applied. The Ministry of Finance is strictly enforcing the July 15th deadline. Even applications from financial institutions in remote areas will be based on the postmark on the letter, and no extensions will be granted. All matters processed after that date pertain to applications submitted before July 15th, where supporting documents were incomplete and are being expedited for submission to facilitate review. (3) Many financial institutions in pacified areas have also prepared documents and applied in advance to reserve the right to resume business. As soon as the local area becomes stable, they will begin operations, and the Ministry of Finance has approved their request. (4) The Ministry of Finance has established a review committee composed of various relevant departments to rigorously review the resumption of business applications of financial institutions. Those found to have forged documents in an attempt to deceive will be handed over to the court for strict punishment, with no leniency. (5) Regarding the management of money exchange businesses, the Ministry of Finance has drafted a complete set of management regulations for money exchange businesses. As this matter is related to the Central Bank's foreign exchange policy, it was submitted to the Central Bank for study two months ago. According to disclosures, the main points of the regulations include: (A) Money exchange businesses should clearly mark their name as "Exchange Shop." (B) They cannot concurrently engage in the business of general banks, etc. Additionally, Director Dai stated that he will be returning to Beijing within days to handle important official matters, having been away from the capital for nearly twenty days.</p>
<p>Buying Forces No Match for Selling Pressure: Chinese Stocks Weaken Again.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks weakened yesterday due to tight money supply and persistent selling pressure. The overall trend was hopeless, easily overwhelmed by short sellers. Initially, stocks opened relatively stable, but soon showed signs of weakness after opening. Yong Sha struggled around the 700 yuan mark. Guangdong-based stocks like No. 162 had some inflows and managed to hold their ground, while No. 176 also saw some buying. However, sellers, such as No. 89, repeatedly exerted pressure, leading to a worsening situation after 10:10 am. Prices were maintained at low levels, but buying forces were no match for selling pressure. Despite some rebounds, it was difficult to sustain. Around noon, buying forces collapsed again, with Yong Sha breaking the low price of 680 yuan and Mei Ya plummeting to 3100 yuan. Short sellers comfortably covered their positions, resulting in a slight rally before closing. Compared to the previous closing, popular stocks like Yong Sha, Xin Guang, and Xin He fell by less than 0.5%, while Mei Ya, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing fell by more than 0.5%. Less popular stocks like Wu He rose slightly, Rong Feng, Li An, and Cement remained flat, and the rest fell slightly. Although trading volume was low in the afternoon, some financial institutions provided support at low prices, improving market sentiment. Popular stocks rebounded somewhat, resulting in slight declines compared to the previous closing for Yong Sha, Jing Fu, Xin Guang, Qin Xing, and Xin He. Mei Ya fell by 0.5%. Less popular stocks like Tong Yi, Zhong Fang, Jing Bei, and Xin Ya Company experienced slight declines. Da Tong, Rong Feng, Zhong Si Nei Yi, Hua Feng Match, and Cement remained flat, while Wu He rose slightly. Stocks traded off-market also experienced slight declines.</p>

<p>US Cotton Exchange Temporarily Suspends Futures Trading, Congress Launches Investigation</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 30th] The New York, New Orleans, and Chicago cotton exchanges have temporarily suspended trading today, as concerned parties deem it necessary to suspend futures trading to thoroughly investigate the recent sharp decline in cotton prices. The Memphis spot market is the only center for spot trading in the South today. Spot prices remained unchanged at 29.45 US cents per pound, with 11,974 bales sold, compared to 6,362 bales sold yesterday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 30th] In the past two weeks, since President Truman announced the lifting of price controls (which did not directly affect cotton prices), the price of various types of cotton has fallen by approximately 10 US cents per pound. The closing price on Tuesday night was less than 30 US cents per pound, while the price on October 8th was nearly 41 US cents per pound at its peak. The sharp fluctuations in cotton prices have drawn criticism from Senator Thomas, who claims that speculative conspiracies are at play, and Congress has launched an investigation.</p>
<p>Analysis and Observation of the Sharp Decline in US Cotton Prices</p>
<p>Spot prices for US cotton reached a peak of 39.78 US cents per pound this year (October 3rd). After mid-October, prices began to decline, falling to 33.45 US cents per pound on October 22nd. Subsequently, prices stabilized, hovering around 36.08 US cents per pound. After October 25th, prices continued to fall sharply, reaching 29.90 US cents per pound by the 30th, falling below the 30-cent mark. This represents a sharp drop of 9.88 US cents per pound from the peak, or 988 points, a rare phenomenon since 1920. The reasons for this sharp decline in US cotton prices are as follows: (1) President Truman broadcast on October 13th that, given the recent rise in prices affecting former President Roosevelt's plans to stabilize people's livelihoods, reasonable adjustments would be made to price policies, especially in the area of cotton textiles (this adjustment aims to suppress prices, not to raise them as interpreted in China). (2) This year's US cotton production is estimated to be the lowest in nearly a decade. Therefore, prices rose in recent months. However, recent calculations of US cotton stocks from last year and this year's harvest indicate that, after supplying domestic consumption and exports, there will still be a surplus of 4 million bales for the next year, so there is no perceived shortage, which may also be one of the reasons for the reversal of previous price increases. (3) In recent months, the Soviet Union has imported cotton to the UK, which has significantly impacted the US cotton market in Europe. (4) Short sellers are intensifying their activities in a favorable environment, which is also contributing to the decline. (5) Government wartime support measures for the 1946 cotton loan are no longer necessary, so subsidies will be reduced for at least 14,805,000 bales. (6) US textile mills' cotton consumption was 11 million bales per year during the war, but has fallen to 10 million bales after the war, a decrease of 1 million bales compared to wartime levels. These are the main factors contributing to the decline in US cotton prices. However, if we further observe the global cotton supply and demand situation, the estimated supply of cotton from all countries for this cotton year is 42 million bales, a decrease of 7 million bales compared to 1939 and a decrease of 5 million bales compared to the average from 1935-1939.</p>
<p>However, consumption for 1946-1947 is expected to increase by approximately 9% compared to 1945-1946. Therefore, the carryover from August 1, 1946, will be lower than the average carryover from 1935-1939.</p>
<p>According to the US Department of Agriculture, cotton inventories as of August 1 this year were 7.5 million bales, compared to 11.2 million bales for the same period in 1945 and 13 million bales for the same period in 1939, indicating a significant decline. Furthermore, the department predicts that the carryover as of August 1, 1947, will not exceed 4 million bales at most. The estimated production of new cotton in the United States is 8.3 million bales, the second-lowest record since 1888. In order to reverse the continued decline in cotton prices, the US Congress is considering increasing exports to Germany and Japan. Therefore, the fundamental statistics for cotton are actually quite good, and it is expected that the downward trend will soon be curbed. Currently, China still feels a shortage of raw cotton, and the deficit will inevitably require reliance on foreign cotton. Therefore, the drop in US cotton prices is an opportunity for the textile industry to obtain inexpensive raw materials, thereby reducing the cost of textiles. (Shi Xinquan)</p>

The British Navy, having just arrived in Shanghai from Japan, had been neglecting practice, resulting in a less-than-stellar performance. As a result, the match became one-sided, with Donghua winning by a landslide of eleven to one. The score at halftime was three to zero.</p>
<p>Donghua's Three Goals</p>
<p>After the kickoff, Donghua's five forwards advanced, and the center forward Dai shot, but the British goalkeeper Xu Men saved it. Li Yao followed up and scored, just one minute after the start of the match. After that, it was all Donghua's offense, but A Dai, A Sun, and Youliang frequently missed opportunities, failing to increase the score. At 23 minutes, Linjing scored, but it was disallowed due to Mingzhe being offside. At 28 minutes, Donghua's forwards launched a combined attack, and A Dai scored near the goal, making it two to zero. Shortly after, A Dai scored again, ending the first half with Donghua leading by three goals.</p>
<p>Like Entering an Unoccupied Land</p>
<p>After the break, Donghua replaced Zhuang Youren with Li Ning and Chen Mingzhe with Han Longhai. Donghua's offense became even stronger, and the British Navy's defense loosened. Donghua was like entering an unoccupied land. Before a minute had passed, Sun Jinshun scored first, making it four to zero. Then, Longhai scored twice in two minutes, bringing the cumulative score to six to zero. Suddenly, the British Navy's Remit committed a handball, resulting in a penalty kick. Youliang took the kick, deliberately shooting wide, as he did not want to increase the score too much. However, the British sailors were out of luck, and their defense was full of loopholes. He Dai and Longhai then scored again, making it eight to zero. The British Navy still had a blank sheet. At 22 minutes, the British army counterattacked, and Donghua seemingly allowed it. Bow Nalai scored, pulling back a goal (8-1). But within two minutes, A Dai immediately returned the favor. In the last ten minutes, Longhai scored two more goals, ending the entire game with a total score of eleven to one. Donghua won a landslide victory.</p>

<p>Question of Whether the Names of the Elected Are Valid</p>
<p>New Interpretation</p>
<h3>Excessive Wartime Damage and High Electricity Generation Costs: Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity Company Explains Reasons for Higher Approved Electricity Rates</h3>
<p>Military and Government Agencies' Waste of Water and Electricity is Especially Problematic</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has carefully considered the city's electricity rates and decided to adjust them starting from the first of this month. Since the Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity Company generates some of its own electricity, with a cost of over 300 yuan per kilowatt-hour, the approved electricity price is set at 6 yuan per kilowatt-hour higher than the French, Chinese, and Pudong companies. A reporter, noting the price differences within the same city, visited the Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity Company to inquire. The person in charge stated: "During the war in Shanghai, our company was occupied by the enemy and puppet regimes, and all engineering equipment suffered enormous losses. Since resuming operations, we have been burdened with debt from the initial efforts to organize repairs and restore power generation facilities. The approved water and electricity rates are far from sufficient to cover costs, resulting in significant losses. Although the municipal authorities have adjusted the electricity rates this time, it is still insufficient to cover costs. The price of coal for public utilities has increased from 30,000 yuan to 85,000 yuan per ton, and the cost of generating electricity independently is over 300 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Even at the highest electricity rate, it cannot cover the costs. What is particularly difficult is that our company's service area is vast, and the lines are widely distributed. During the war, most of the houses in this area were used by enemy troops and foreign residents. After their surrender and retreat, they were all allocated to our military and government agencies and their families. They owe a total of over 600 million yuan in water and electricity bills, all of which are delayed in payment. Unauthorized connections are also rampant, and the waste of water and electricity is unlimited, causing frequent transformer failures due to overload. Recently, the municipal authorities, due to insufficient power supply, have established measures to restrict electricity use. However, enforcing these measures on military and government agencies is very difficult. On one hand, we hope that all agencies will conserve resources, but if water and electricity bills cannot be paid according to regulations, it will inevitably hinder the advancement of our business. Our company believes that without a fundamental solution to the problem of unpaid water and electricity bills and unauthorized connections by military and government agencies and their families, the allocation of public power will never be rational. We are currently appealing to the authorities."</p>

<h3>Standards for Ordering New Ships: Aviation Industry Hopes for Revision</h3>
<p>Impractical Regulations by the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Since the Ministry of Communications stipulated the standards for the civil aviation industry to order new ships, the aviation industry believes that they are somewhat impractical. For example, in terms of ship age, the regulations stipulate that it cannot exceed 28 years. However, in fact, most of the ships purchased according to this regulation were hastily built during the First World War and may not be durable. Similarly, the Liberty ships built during the war are not ideal ships for peacetime. The aviation industry is currently negotiating with the Ministry of Communications, hoping to make appropriate revisions to various regulations.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper and China National Aviation Corporation: Dispatch Aircraft to Celebrate Birthday: Fly Over Beijing and Shanghai: Distribute 150,000 Birthday Greeting Flyers in Both Locations</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, this newspaper and the China National Aviation Corporation jointly dispatched a special birthday celebration plane to fly over Shanghai and distribute colorful birthday greeting flyers. In the afternoon, it flew directly to the capital to pay respects. A reporter from this newspaper accompanied the flight to inspect. The plane was a silver-white C-47, with a giant "longevity" character painted in vermillion red on the belly, surrounded by a square frame. The wingtips and tail were tied with red and green silk ribbons several feet long. The plane, piloted by Mr. Chen Wenhui, chief pilot of the China National Aviation Corporation, took off at 10:50 AM. It flew along the Huangpu River and the Bund, over Hongkou, the North Railway Station, and the racetrack. The racetrack, considered the center of the city, was circled several times to distribute 100,000 birthday greeting flyers. For a moment, colorful paper flew in the air, creating a dazzling scene. Looking down from an altitude of 700 feet, the crowds moving on Nanjing Road and Xizang Road appeared particularly excited. The neatly arranged teams on the racetrack lawn also waved to welcome the plane. At 11:20 AM, the plane landed at the airport to rest.</p>
<p>At 12:45 PM, the plane took off again and headed towards the capital. At an altitude of 3,000 feet and a speed of 130 miles per hour, it flew westward against the headwind over the early autumn fields. At 1:30 PM, it passed through Wuxi. Having learned in advance that the Chairman was in Wuxi to avoid birthday celebrations, it flew low over the city center to show respect. The crowds of people in the park were clearly visible below. At approximately 2:00 PM, it crossed a range of hills, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum appeared to the lower right of the aircraft. At 2:20 PM, it landed at Ming Palace Airport.</p>
<p>After a short rest, the plane ascended and flew over the city, distributing 50,000 birthday greeting flyers. The streets of the capital were filled with pedestrians, especially teams from various organizations and schools, appearing like a swarm of ants. There was even more congestion in front of the Lishi Society, creating a New Year's atmosphere.</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the plane returned with the tailwind, making the journey even faster. In just over an hour, it arrived in the western suburbs of Shanghai. At 4:45 PM, it safely landed at Longhua Airport.</p>
<p>[Another Report] To celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 60th birthday, the Air Force stationed in Shanghai flew a trainer aircraft from Jiangwan Airport at 9:30 AM yesterday, circling over the city and scattering colorful paper birthday wishes for an hour before returning to its base.</p>

<h3>Xue Jianqiu, Kidnapped Twice, Admits to Serving as Enemy Translator: Claims to Have Participated Under Orders: Prosecutor Indicts Him for Numerous Crimes</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Xue Jianqiu, who was previously kidnapped by bandits and rescued by the police, was reported as a traitor. After investigation and prosecution by the Higher Procuratorate, the High Court held a hearing yesterday. The prosecutor's indictment stated that the defendant served as a translator for the Meiji Agency in Zhuji County. Relying on the power of the enemy and puppet regimes, he forcibly occupied civilian houses in the Jiangjia Lane of Heng Street in Zhuji and opened the East Asia Company for the enemy, serving as its manager. He also privately opened the Yongming Company, specializing in collecting materials such as wood, copper, iron, and oil for the enemy. He also led enemy and puppet troops in looting cattle and property from the villages of Shaojiang, Dalian, Changtai, Changhe, and Changyi in the county, burning more than a dozen houses belonging to Zhou Qiaonan, Shou Yongsui, Yu Jinhao, and He Xiaoqiao. He beat to death an old woman, Shou Chen, and injured more than a dozen villagers, including Shou Yongsui. He also extorted 500,000 yuan from each bao (neighborhood unit) in Dalian Township, including Licun in the first bao, Yangjiaduntou, Jiujiang Temple, Zhaojiabu Jianggao in the second bao, Shenjia in the third bao, Shanhou in the seventh bao, Zhoujiaping Qingta in the eighth bao, and Xiashantou Huashan in the ninth bao. The defendant, wearing a gray woolen robe, Western-style pants, yellow leather shoes, with his hair styled and wearing rimless glasses, looked like a college student. He stated: He is 33 years old, originally from Fujian, and lives at 99 Peng Road. He used to work as a peddler and is now unemployed. His father was an overseas Chinese in Japan, so he grew up in Japan and attended elementary school in Tokyo. He returned to China at the age of eleven. He admitted to serving as a translator for the Meiji Agency in Zhuji, claiming it was under the orders of Bi Gaokui of the Military Statistics Bureau. Later, he opened the Yongming Company, engaging in the peddling of daily necessities. From the autumn of 1943 to the spring of 1944, he also served as the manager of the Southeast Company branch, a joint Chinese-Japanese venture that bought and sold timber. After the victory, others mistakenly believed he was a traitor and thought he had money, so he was kidnapped twice. The first time was in Hangzhou last September, kidnapped by Yang Songshan, Yang Shiyu, etc. He never paid the ransom and was rescued by Bi Gaokui. The second time was on July 25 of this year, kidnapped in front of the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan on Er Ma Road and Jiujiang Road. The mastermind was Zhang Xifu, who initially demanded 20 million, then reduced it to 10 million, but he refused. The police solved the case. Because the two attempted kidnappings and extortions failed, they attributed everything done by the enemy and puppet regimes to him. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. When Xue met with his elderly mother, he stroked her shoulders and cried, exchanging a few words before being escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Public Funds for Prostitution: Desertion and Escape Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Mao Yunhui, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the Xuzhou Transportation Company, embezzled public funds and fled on October 14.

<h3>Black Market for Cotton Yarn Persists: Textile Control Committee Seeks to Eliminate It: Four Resolutions Transferred to Cotton Textile Association: Meeting on Saturday to Formulate Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its ninth regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Chairman Wu, Vice Chairman Li, and committee members Wang Yangxian, Yang Xiren, Wang Qiyu, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, and Liu Wenteng, director of the committee's business department, were present. Chairman Wu gave a speech, stating that since the third phase of cotton yarn distribution began, the black market for cotton yarn has persisted. He hoped that in addition to the more than 12,000 bales of cotton yarn that had already been distributed, the remaining yarn in stock should continue to be supplied to the market at the agreed price, in order to eliminate the black market. Discussions then began, and four resolutions were ultimately decided: (1) Whether futures or not, starting from October 25th, all sales should be made at the agreed price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn. If there were differences in the previous futures prices, the differences should be adjusted. (2) Except for futures buyers who have priority, the remaining yarn cannot be refused for sale. (3) The quantity of cotton yarn exported by each factory should be reported to the committee for record. (4) Whether futures or spot goods, the names, addresses, and quantities of the buyers should be recorded in detail and reported to the committee for record. The above resolutions were handed over to committee member Wang Qiyu to be submitted to the board meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, which will be held this Saturday, for discussion and formulation of implementation measures.</p>
<h3>Increase Quantity Transported to the South</h3>
<p>There were also several other resolutions, including: (1) Increasing the quantity of yarn and cloth transported to the south. According to a survey by the Textile Control Committee, yarn prices are currently the highest in South China. Moreover, the originally scheduled quantity of yarn and cloth transported to the south was insufficient to meet the consumption demand in that region. It was resolved to increase the yarn quantity by 2,000 bales, bringing the total to 4,967 bales. The cloth quantity will be increased by 35,000 bolts, bringing the total to 110,647 bolts. The Textile Control Committee is now conducting a survey of the production and consumption of yarn and cloth throughout the country in order to compile a master table, and then allocate the distribution in a unified manner. The allocation quantity will be adjusted according to the supply and demand situation in various regions.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Yarn Merchant Profits</h3>
<p>(2) Regulations on Yarn Merchant Profits: The wholesale price should not exceed 5% of the agreed price. For 20-count yarn, this means it should not exceed 1,837,000 yuan. The retail price should not exceed 10%. For 20-count yarn, this means it should not exceed 1,925,000 yuan. The other counts should be calculated proportionally. (3) The price of yarn distributed in the first week of the third phase will be based on the price agreed upon by the Price Negotiation Committee of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association. Starting next week, the yarn will be distributed according to the price list previously drafted by the Textile Control Committee. The prices are as follows: 10-count 1,520,000 yuan, 12-count 1,580,000 yuan, 16-count 1,620,000 yuan, 20-count 1,750,000 yuan, 32-count 2,320,000 yuan, 32-count double-ply 2,610,000 yuan, 40-count 2,770,000 yuan, 42-count 2,770,000 yuan, 42-count double-ply 2,790,000 yuan. The total amount of yarn distributed in the first half of the third phase is 12,004.5 bales, starting from October 26 and ending on November 10. The distribution of yarn in the second half of the third phase will begin on November 11.</p>
<p>The Textile Control Committee has completed the review of the data for the yarn and cloth manufacturers transporting goods to the south. However, many of the distributors' data deviate significantly from the committee's standards. It has now been decided to slightly lower the standards and conduct another review. Once approved, registration cards will be issued, and applications can be accepted starting next week.</p>
<h3>News of Resumed Auctions in Hong Kong: Stimulates Rise in Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were quite excited yesterday due to news that auctions in Hong Kong may resume by the middle of next month. Demand exceeded supply, resulting in gains of around 10% for Ewo Yarns, British United Paper, Ewo Brewery, and Asian stocks, and gains of slightly less than 10% for Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dock, and Guangdong Steel. Paper stocks rose by slightly less than 15%.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Weaken</h3>
<p>Government bonds weakened yesterday as some accounts and Fuyuan sold off shares. Trading volume was around 4 million yuan. Tongbing opened at 1,930 yuan, but as supply exceeded demand, it fell back to 1,800 yuan before stabilizing slightly. At noon, it hovered around 1,850 yuan, ultimately closing 100 yuan lower than the previous close. Jiayi, Yi, and Ding fell by slightly less than 30 yuan each, and Tongwu fell by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit and Weak Sales: Yarn and Cloth Both Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell across the board yesterday. Factories allocated yarn were either forced by tight credit or because the count did not match the intended use, secretly selling on the yarn market. All yarns 42-count and below fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. In addition, actual sales in the interior were extremely weak, and quotations from Guangdong and Hankou were stagnant. Consequently, the Shanghai brokers were cautious.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Textile Construction Company opened six types of fine cloth and four types of serge. The prices of the fine cloth were 1,000 yuan lower than the last resolution. The Four Gentlemen serge remained at the original price due to processing costs. Very few people came to place orders. Sales to customers from other provinces have disappeared in recent days. Local traders are also unwilling to take in the goods due to the tight credit situation at the end of the month. In addition, retail sales in the city are weak due to the mild weather, so market prices have not improved. The price of Tiao Li bleaching cloth had fallen to as low as 90,000 yuan in the past two days. Yesterday, small buyers from Hankou absorbed some of the supply, and the price rebounded to 92,500 yuan, demonstrating the close relationship between supply and demand and prices.</p>
