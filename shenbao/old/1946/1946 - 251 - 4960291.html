<p>〔本報泰縣七日電〕海安周圍戰事，仍在進行中，共軍昨晚又以密集砲火轟擊，幾度衝鋒，均未得逞，冠軍士氣旺盛，沉着應戰，故共軍欲侵佔該鎭，殆為夢想。今午空軍曾以物品醫藥等投至該鎭，惟有少數物品，誤投於姜堰。</p>

<h3>行總檢討會今閉幕　蔣延黻昨宣布重要决定　與糧部商交換糧食辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕行總工作檢討會七日晨舉行第三次大會，聽取各小組報告。開會後，將署長廷被宣佈大會快八日午後閉幕，　會議能加速進行，　各分署負責人能迅速返原地工作。繼謂。渠對各小組所作決議。將予愼重考慮，並盡　遵守，惟由於交通與特資之兩難，不敢答應全辦。易言之，小組決　並無拘東力。詞　，即由　恤等五小組負責　召集人分別報告，並由蔣署長發表對各小組報吿之意見。蔣氏於會中宣布：（一）重要決定：即該署正與糧食部洽商糧食交換辦法，以减省運輸費用，並　出交通工具。會議至十二時許始。下午第七小組　績開會，討論各分署業務聯　問題。下午三時，蔣署長召集各分署長舉行座談會，討論行政問題，檢討會定八日晨舉行第四次大會，聽取六七兩組報告，並由副署長卓　報告參加華府聯總第五次大會經過，下午舉行閉幕式。</p>
<p>遺送難民年底為止</p>
<p>各小組中最先報告者為賬恤組召集人　　綿着重難民遣送，該組難民遣送一律辦理至本年底爲止，如有人數過多，交通工具供應不足或事實上有必要，可續辦至明年三月底。關於僑胞遣送，決議立即開始，暫定辦至明年五月底作初步結束，如有需要，得酌量延長，並儘先遣送華僑機工及已集中海口之歸僑。蔣署長對此事指示爲；遣送華北難胞須視鐵道交通情形而定，其次須視其家鄕是否已安謐，不然回鄕後仍是難胞。</p>
<p>希望渡過糧食難關</p>
<p>由農業善後小組召集人報告，蔣氏對該組之指示爲：行總至十月起每月須還中央銀行一百億元，經濟困難，故盼農林部在此方面能多負責。繼說明在糧食上仍需聯總帮忙，以備渡過明年六七八月之難關。</p>
<p>配購機器擬定原則</p>
<p>工礦善後小組由張兹閱報告，關於各工廠申請配購機器事，該組擬定下列數原則：（一）收復區曾受損害之工礦可申請；（二）祇限於恢復至戰前情况，定價方面，力求公允，付款方法，擬首次付百分之十五至甘五，餘款分期交付，期限爲五年至十年。蔣氏對此事之指示爲：工礦事業爲一種生產事業，應爲全國人民諜利益，而不應祇顧少數人私利，再者，行總不負戰事損失賠償之責。關於分期付款事，蔣氏認亦有困難，蓋若干年以後，貨幣物價將演變至何種情形，實無法預知，而行總本身爲一短期性機構，若干分署明年將次第結束，行總結束後，將來之收益，應撥作各地衛生事業經費。</p>
<p>衛生報告最受注意</p>
<p>衛生報告為大會最引人注意之問題，行總決將此事請衛生署負責辦理。蔣氏稱：余對衛生事業，向極重視，但現已到無能爲力之階段，如無法籌款，叫我蔣某人綁票打搶都來，並舉當年革命時，有人主張搶金菩薩爲例，盼在塲者能吿訴金菩薩所在地。出語滑稽而沉痛，會塲空氣輕快不少。蔣氏並警吿各分署署長，分署經費將調整，盼能盡力撙節。</p>
<p>運輸購銷簡化手續</p>
<p>最後由劉鴻生報告物資運輸分配購銷小組提案審査意見，除談及四萬三千四百萬元之運輸費籌措不易外，提出兩點，盼各分署能簡化手續，以省費用。劉氏認目前最大毛病，爲未請專門人扌辦專門事業，致運輸購銷大多由商人辦理，同時以登陸艇運輸物資，缺點亦多，惟保證十萬噸物資即可運抵漢口。詞畢，由蔣氏作結論謂：我人工作一日，即運輸一日，故運輸工作決不能忽視，而各分署將來能獲得多少物資，即視其運輸快慢多寡而定，凡倉庫中有物資積貯者，總署即不供給其物資。蔣對運輸甚表不滿，認公路運輸隊失敗，必設法予以改組，甚　將其取消，亦所不惜。</p>
<p>蔣氏宣佈重要事實</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美國重申對德政策</h3>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納斯，前天自巴黎前往德國，在史都伽特城發表演說，闡明美國的對德政策，要點有五：（一）主張德國應立即建立中央臨時政府；（二）美國不願見德國成爲任何一强國或集團之附庸，亦不願見德人再受獨裁者的統治；（三）英美法蘇四國佔領區應取消一切隔閡，務使德國在經濟上完全統一；（四）設立德國民族委員會，在聯合國管制之下，處理國事，並起草憲法，以組成德國永久性質之聯邦國；（五）美國反對德國將薩爾區割讓與法國及將柯恩尼斯堡區割讓與蘇聯。</p>
<p>貝氏在啓啟程前往德國之前，曾與法國外長比杜爾會晤，交換雙方對於德國問題的意見，並向其表示願將演詞草稿先行通知法國當局，可見貝氏的演說，不僅爲英國完全贊同，即法國也有相當的諒解。惟斯拉夫各國，允其是蘇聯與波蘭，一定要表示異議，或且認爲貝氏的演說違背波茨坦協定的規定，亦未可知。不過蘇聯對於貝爾納斯之赴柏林，當早有所聞，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫自莫斯科遄返巴黎途中，曾在柏林盤桓若干時間，一定也有所佈置，藉以抵消貝氏演說所引起的反應。所以貝氏的演說，不僅有關德國將來的命運，甚至整個歐洲的分合，也可在這次柏林之行中見其端倪。</p>
<p>自從去年五月九日德國投降之日起，歐洲戰事就可視爲終了，如何收拾戰後歐洲的殘局，如何管制戰敗的納粹德國，論理列强早應該商得一個具體辦法，俾歐洲各國早日恢復正常狀態。殊不料英美蘇三巨頭在波茨坦會晤時，因爲對日戰爭尙未結束，大家的精力都集中在對日作戰上，無暇顧及戰敗的德國，因此僅在原則上決定幾個辦法。及至日本投降之後，五國外長在倫敦開會，討論歐洲和平問題，又因英·美·與蘇聯的利害參差，不歡而散，而歐洲問題遂陷於僵局，一直到現在，德國問題還像一團亂麻，無從淸理起。</p>
<p>但是德國被英美法蘇四國佔領迄今，業已一年有餘，在這年餘的時間內，德國好像被列强肢解，分裂了四個國家，不僅在政治上不統一，即在經濟上也不統一。駐軍費用的重担已使德人不勝負祖，再加上人爲的隔閡，使物資不能流通，一般德國人民，都感覺到生活的困頓，及新生德國的渺茫，就是英美佔領軍當局，也覺得目前情形，如果不加改善，長此以往，則佔領德國的目的——（一）肅淸納粹餘孽，（二）解除德國武力，（三）使德國政治民主化，（四）使德國不復能再起侵略，威脅世界和平等等，也將感無法實現。英美法三國，於是都要想改善德國在法理上的地位。在第二次巴黎四國外長會議時，英美兩國外長就把德國問題提出討論，主張四國佔領區實行合併，統一經濟機構，可是又遭到蘇聯外長的反對，未能商得協議，莫洛托夫僅同意至本年九月間聯合國大會閉幕之後，再行召開四國外長會議，專門討論德國問題。但是聯合國大會能吾如期開會，或尙不能斷言，而要至聯合國大會之後再討論德國問題，更不知要延宕到那一天了。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯以美國第一流外交家的資格正視現實，深知解決德國問題的宋難，乃改變方針，避重就輕，先從英美兩國佔領區合併經濟機構做起，雙方即進行談判，已於本月五日宣佈協議成立。貝爾納斯此次赴德演說。闡美國的對德政策，實有深長的意義。法國將步英國的後塵，加人英美佔領區之經濟機構，似不致發生問題；所成問題的，唯蘇聯一國而已。届時英美與蘇聯在歐洲的對立形勢，益加露骨，歐洲之分爲「東」「西」，恐更不可避免了。同時，聯合國大會如果延期舉行，德國問題又不知要到何年何月始能討論呢！</p>
<p>要之，我們站在第三者的立塲，分析貝爾納斯所發表的演說，終覺得美國對待戰敗國的態度、可稱光明，寬大與仁慈，是未可厚非的。因爲美國所需要的，是合理的永久的和平，故對於一切基於「報復」所採取之任何措置，均所反對。我們但願欲以報復加諸戰敗國者，對於美國的寬大爲懷，再三思之。</p>

<h3>繁榮台灣　陳儀深信必能達目的</h3>
<p>〔合衆社特派員台北六日電〕台灣落人日本人的手中達五十年之久，現在歸還中國了。在日本佔據的幾十年巾，台灣頗有發展，但是大部份的工廠，在戰時遭遇破壞，民衆的日本化程度也很深，所以中國政府怎樣去接受日本人遺留下來的財富，而便富饒的台灣獲得繁榮，實在是一個很重要的課題。台灣行政長官陳儀，深信台灣在他治理之下，可以達到這個目的。</p>
<p>在最近舉有的一次招待記者會上，陳氏說：把台灣從一個日本殖民地的地位改變爲中國的一省這樁工作，相當緩慢而多周折。而該島的復興工作，由於戰時曾遭猛烈空襲和其他破壞的緣故，也很困難。</p>
<p>他說：日本在台灣的政策，就是日本人在各方面都高據於當地民衆之上，他們在生活的各方面都佔據機要的地位。由於日本人的遣返，人力方面覺感到嚴重的缺乏，沒有適當的人物去接替這些重要的位置。</p>
<p>據陳長官透露：截止一九四六年四月三十日爲止的四十五天中，在美軍協助之下，總共遺返了日本軍人十一萬七千人和平民二十九萬人。爲了說明遣返工作所造成的人力缺乏起見，陳氏指出在返國二十九萬日本平民中，有七千個是警察　，一萬一千六百個是中小學敎師。</p>
<p>陳氏又說：行政長官公署的計劃是盡量用合灣人來代替日本人，至於更重要的職位，必須由中國本部來的公務人員担任，因爲合灣人在資能上還不大够。凡是選拨出來代替日本人的當地民衆，事先都給予專門的訓練。</p>
<p>在物資方面，台灣也極感缺乏。日本在台灣推行的經濟政策，一向是「日本第一」主義。在日本佔領該島的大部份時期中，台灣在日本帝國的整個計劃內，一向是一個農業單位，直到太平洋戰爭爆發前以及在戰爭進行期間，日本人扌開始在工業上開發台灣，結果，台灣就完全依賴日本。</p>
<p>爲了說明這一點起見，陳氏指出下面的事實：他說，日本人鼓勵台灣人使用化學肥料，每年消耗達五十萬噸，但該島却一點也不生產這種化學肥料，直到戰爭結束不久以前，扌建設了幾家小型的化學肥料廠。在今年上半年中，台灣亟需肥料二十五萬噸，但是所輸入的祗有聯總運來的二千五百噸而已。</p>
<p>恢復台灣工業的主要困難之一，就是沒有新機器，零件和工具可以裝配到日本人建設的工廠中去。有幾家供給這種配備的工廠已經被炸毁，另有幾家則已停工。</p>
<p>交通工具的缺乏，搆成該島復興的又一障碍。往來於台灣各口岸的日本船隻，在戰時早已被日本海軍所徵發而沉失或損壞了。可供應用的船隻並無一定的班期，而且不是以應付大規模之貿易，祗有中國航空公司開辦一星期飛行三次之航空線。</p>
<p>該島上之公路及鐵路，因戰時失修及被炸之故，大都已損壞不堪。當局企圖輸入自動車輛，已遭遇困難·但是鐵路車輛雖感缺乏，橋樑路軌雖受損壞，火車却仍定期行駛。</p>
<p>台灣行政上所遭遇到的另一種困難，便是言語的隔閡，台灣人大部份從福建移入，操着所謂南閩語或廈門方言，日人控制該島時，曾竭力推行日本口語和文字，結果台灣人喪失了使用國語的能力。</p>
<p>陳長官相信在一九四七年夏季，台灣所有學校書籍將採用國語，台灣學生中百分之七十至八十，經過特種語言學校的訓練，已經能够使用國語。</p>
<p>台灣最著名的幾家中國報紙仍舊保留日女版，以便利讀者，但至十月下旬即將停版，惟一部份讀者要求再繼續若干時。</p>
<p>陳長官在招待記者會中承認來自中國大陸的多數公務員的薪給，比較當地台灣人爲優厚，他說：來自大陸的公務員生活程度較當地台人爲高，而且遠離家鄕，開支常然較大。他否認對於台人有任何歧視的地方，並且聲明凡是扌具較優的人自然應該量扌銓敘薪給。</p>
<p>陳氏聲明：鑒於中國大陸上通貨膨脹情形，台幣將繼續使用若千時。倘於此時實行統一幣制，其結果必然引起合灣人的嚴重的經濟反響。台幣匯率前曾規定爲法幣二十元兌換台幣一元，台民請求行政院將匯率修正爲四十對一，尙待南京方面的決定。同時台燈與中國大陸間的匯兌暫時停止。</p>
<p>陳長官透露：前爲日僑或日本政府所有現已由省政府接收的地產，將直接租賃與農民，作爲一種濟助。據悉；當局已擬具計劃。設立合作社，給農民以技術上與經濟上的援助。</p>
<p>陳氏又宣佈：台民將有參加各級行政機構——包括由人民普選產生的村議會至省議會————的均等機會。</p>

<h3>美海員工潮擴大　參加罷工人數達五十萬　兩洋船隻兩千五百餘艘因此停駛　丹希挪瑞四國海員決定響應</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約六日電〕美海員罷工者達五十萬名，大西洋·太平洋·及各海灣停駛之船隻，在二千五百艘以上，堅持罷工到底，至工資平衡局撤回其減少工資增加數時為止。資方應允工資增加為廿二元五角，但平衡局則裁決為十七元五角，按目下每月工資平均為一百四十五元。美海運委會發言人稱：此為美國海運史上最浪費的罷工。渡洋客運完全停頓，重要工業原料之進出口亦已受阻。</p>
<p>聯總運往歐亞洲之救濟品。亦滯留一百廿五艘船上，聯總署長賴伽第亞自歐洲返此，據談：渠將籲請罷工腳夫，繼續裝載救濟品前往需要各國。罷工將使貨船所載食物腐敗，海運當局已籲海員會，將船上冷氣設備繼續開放，以防食物發徵。罷工影響全國經濟，太平洋美船主協會已籲請杜魯門立即出而干涉，以圖解救。工會與資方并無糾紛，僅與政府機構對抗，故雇主方面無能為力。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約六日電〕美海員工會發言人頃宣稱：丹麥·挪威·瑞典四國海員，已決定遣派糾察員至各該國港口，響應美海員罷工。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕陸軍部宣布：海員罷工遍及全國，歐洲美國佔領軍之糧食，及其他接濟亦受阻碍，日本方面佔領軍之接濟，尤其陷於停頓。海外軍隊目下存糧，尚可供六個月之用，故暫時并無危機。</p>

<h3>太平洋各島地位　美正作縝密研究</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓六日電〕據可靠息：此間官方人士對太平洋各島將來在法理上之地位，殊深關切，對各該島嶼，應否全部佔領，或局部佔領，抑或交與聯合國託管等項問題，均在研究之中。美陸海軍部認為佔領此項基地，對美國安全，誠為不可缺少者。此項基地可分為三類：（一）前由日本代管之太平洋島嶼，即馬里亞納，加羅林，馬紹爾等群島。（二）前屬日本之領土，如沖繩島等。（三）前屬英國統治之屬地毀澳洲之代管地等，據一般意見，大致如下：對於第一類，美國陸軍可以自行決定佔領期限之久暫。對於第二類，美國可以設法獲得託管權。對於第三類，美國亦　設法獲得聯合託管權。其間若干島嶼，在戰略上頗有價值，應交由軍事管制者，故此項問題，實極複雜。</p>

<p>（又電）四強管日委會蘇聯方面對麥帥總部拒絕撥給船隻以供撤退蘇軍佔領區內日僑事，表示不滿美代表艾其森今日答覆稱：蘇聯代表特萊夫楊科不欲進行討論韓北及東九省以外之日僑遣送事宜，使問題全部解決，致數十萬日本戰門人員仍在蘇聯手中。總部代表已向蘇聯代表聲明，總部隨時準備充分船隻，撤退全部日僑俘。其他國家對遣送日僑俘問題，無不立予完全同意。關於蘇軍區內日僑俘撤退歸國事，與蘇聯代表在東京談判旣告停頓，美代表已據情轉呈華盛頓，將由美政府與蘇聯政府繼續進行談判在東九省及韓北為蘇聯俘去之日軍約有八十萬。仍未遣送返國云。</p>

<h3>招商局闢中菲航綫　海廈輪將駛馬尼刺　在菲購得美輪逾百艘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局復業以來，得政府輔助，大事擴張，船舶隻數較戰前已起過三倍以上，並仍不斷在國外選購。本年五月間該局曾奉行政院令，派嚴增福赴菲島選購美國外剩餘物資之船舶。在菲視察月餘，選購得大小各種船隻百餘艘。嚴君於六日返滬，七日在局對記者談南洋情形及船舶來滬日期稱：菲律濱獨立以後，氣象一新，惟因受戰事影響，田野荒蕪，一時難以耕種，致影響農產至鉅，故物資異常缺乏，目下急需者，以棉製品。電料器具，以及瓷器等類爲最，切盼我國運銷。菲島木材出產極夥，國人在菲新設鋸木廠甚多，已運華之木材爲數可觀。至選購美國外剩餘船舶，計有拖輪。鐵駁·碼頭。吊鈎。挖泥船。等一百十五艘，大部尙在修理中，的本年底可陸續來滬。至招商局開關中菲航錢，已派定海　輪行駛。菲島方面已託華發公司代理。菲民歡迎我國船舶前往，菲輪業已行駛香港厦門間，不久將來上海，素悉滬菲間之　貨運，因有美商直達之巨輪行駛，恐不能達到理想，故海厦輪之航道，亦以厦門至菲律濱間各埠爲主要目標。因華僑大部經商於厦菲間。該輪昨已由津返滬，或不再北駛，即準備駛菲手續。</p>
<h3>「服務社會　鍜鍊自己」　女警士今非昔比　年輕心細曾受嚴格訓練　受漂亮大都不喜穿制服</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕一般人對於「女警士」道個名稱，似乎多少帶　一點歧視的目光。這歧視的由來，是基於對這門職業的生疏和不了解。記者爲了好奇心所驅使，向女警士作了一番實地的調査，對於女警士的沿革和現狀，有了比較淸楚的輪廓。</p>
<p>上海之有女警士，遠在抗戰以前。當時蔡勁軍任上海市公安局局長，爲搜索女犯等工作上的需要起見，任用女警士。這些女警士和前公共租界巡捕房的女警察不同。那些女警察俗稱「女抄靶子」，大都爲巡捕之妻子或寡婦充任，智識水準極低，社會人士對於她們也都投以輕視的目光。她們除了站在路口，祖任婦女的抄靶子工作外，就不再有任何任務。</p>
<p>勝利以後，警局銳意整頓革新，爲了警士的缺乏和女警的需要，便公開招考，投考人至少須有初中以上程度，或具同等學力。錄取以後，都須到楡林路警察訓練所受訓一個月。訓練期間，一切膳宿費都由公家供給。所中生活非常艱苦，如席地用膳等，一切採軍事化。早晨五時三刻，號聲一吹，大家都得馬上起來，一刻鐘之內梳洗完畢。六時正必須集齊草塲，分隊早操。半小時後，號聲復響，於是行升旗禮。這一切動作，包括早餐在內，須在七時前完畢。七時正開始上課，所讀的科目繁多，有違警犯法，刑法摘要，警察法令，警察尺牘等。此外，手槍敎練，練習打靶等，亦在訓練範圍以內。一個月期滿以後，舉行畢業考試三天，合格者再分派至各部門工作，規定一年之內，不得離職，否則應賠償受訓期內公家之一切損失。</p>
<p>到目前爲止，上海女警的數目，的有二百餘人，她們年紀都很輕，平均在十五歲到二十五歲之間。所担任的大多爲內勤工作。如舞女登記，戶籍工作。司法科口供筆錄，迷途兒童看護等工作。因爲通常女子比較細心，所以成績斐然，社會的觀感也爲之一新。</p>
<p>她們的工作分配須聽命於長官，有時候，她們也有機會參加外勤工作，如到橋頭上捉「癟三」，白天査「野鷄」等，都有她們的份。因此，她們對於現社會有了進一步的了解，允其是社會的陰暗面。</p>
<p>像警察局中所有人員一樣，女警士須穿一律的制服。夏季的衣服規定是白襯衫，黑裙子。冬天和男警士一模一樣——長褲子，棉大衣。她們都不喜歡穿制服，因爲她們都很年靑，年靑的人總是愛漂亮的。</p>
<p>目前，她們的待遇和一一一等警士相同。月入僅十萬元。對於這過薄的薪酬，自然免不了有一番抱怨，但是這是整個經濟問題，單憑抱怨是沒有用的，好在她們都沒有負担，而且對於日常工作，都有很大的興趣，她們說：「做了女警士，一面可以服務社會。一面又可以　鍊自己！」</p>

<h3>校少生多問題嚴重　朱教長王晶晉謁主席報告　杭教次五日飛牯朱教次同日回京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕教部朱部長家驊，與朱次長經農，前赴牯嶺出席青年團會議，（朱部長為常務幹事，朱次長為監事），并為內地學校復員之交通工具缺乏，與首都及其他各地，因學校復員而校舍有問題，與校少生多問題嚴重，均感不能照原定計畫實施各級教育，而物價飛漲，影響前定預算，以致教費不敷甚鉅，將各項情形，報告蔣主席，請予救濟。教部杭次長立武，亦因係青年團幹事，於五日由京飛赴牯嶺。朱次長乃於五日下午回京，處理部務。本報記者於六日往訪朱次長，承告云：關於教育事項，報告蔣主席之後，如何解決，須俟朱部長回京，始得其詳。朱部長五日晉謁主席，并須俟八日青年團會議之後，或遲至閉會之時回京，故最早約在十日左右。青年團之討論要點，其職能是否屬於教育，抑屬政治，又是否屬於黨內範圍，抑在黨之範圍以外，正待研究討論，尚未決定，無校容納，此事有關經費，部長請求蔣主席之後，尚須與宋院長面商此事。又後方未復員各校，因最近又因徵糧運輸繼續影響，遲遲難行。教部有建議請指定一二隻船，專為學校復員旅運之用，但不知能否達到此希望耳。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕教部現正呈請行政院，迅令佔用校舍機關遷讓，以便學校復校，以免學生失學。本學期各校均感人滿，不敷容納，據朱教次經農稱：主要原因，實係渝陷區學生入學者眾，加以青年軍復員，臨大實習班分發，先修班升學，後方學生還鄕，及翻譯宣轉學等等，遂造成校少生多現象，部方正在計劃，多方補救。</p>

<h3>銀行買興甚濃　債市又被拉上</h3>

<h3>戶口糖定期實施　公司決儘量配售消滅黑市　外埠已申請者仍酌予配售</h3>
<p>本市食糖，自配售辦法改善後，漲勢已受壓迫，轉告下瀉。據臺糖公司負責人談，食糖市場，可趨穩定，本公司源源運到，如糖價再發生波動，本公司可直接拋售，不顧一切犧牲，以到平抑目的為止，本公司今後配售，以糖商公會會員為對象，本埠外埠，均由糖商批發，南貨業會員，則專負辦理，平價食糖之責，至計口售糖，決於十三期開始辦理，第十二期七日截止登記，第十三期自下禮拜六開始登記，即辦理分發購糖事宜，實行憑證購糖，前擬每人每月憑證購糖二次，每次半斤，現決定改為一次，每次一斤，經辦零售店，所領食糖銷售數量，即以所收之購糖證為穞考之根據，此項辦法實施，市民確可得受實惠，經售者不易轉入黑市，以圖暴利。</p>
<h3>外埠申請各戶移轉臺糖酌配</h3>
<p>本市社會局前以核定配售糖價與黑市糖價相差太遠，流弊甚大，特召集食糖價格審議委員會重行議定價格，計中砂十四萬元，生砂十三萬元，因糖價業已變更，所有本埠糖業公會及外埠各地申請配糖均告失效，應一律重行申請，并經該會議決通過已誌昨報，茲聞外埠糖商寗子春等以辦法變更，連受損失，申請社會局收回成命，該局以所稱各節尚屬實情，已允予轉請臺糖公司核辦，經將外埠糖商及合作社等申請配售第十二期臺糖原文曁附件，一併移送該公司辦理，關於糖價仍應依照議定價格付款云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕桕油因時屆中秋，正燭淘需用浩繁之際，又因天時炎熱，裝運不便，來源減少，售價逐漸高漲，各行家有幾至無貨應市之趨勢，浙東產區，存各積本已不多，故到杭之貨，已凋零不堪，惟漢口所到荊州蔴城等貨，尚絡繹不絕，但轉運到申，頗費時日，所謂遠水不濟近火，本埠各家，雖有辦成，到者不多，售盤已步步增加，計禾本柏油十五萬元，內坪十四萬元，獨砠油十三萬六千元，龍尖十三萬二千元，的干油十二萬八千元，麻城油十二萬元。</p>

<p>轉輾晨歷中秋，本街茶店莊，以門市云化頻增，故需胃迄未減色，同時蘇錫一帶蒐羅亦甚殷切，至於洋莊茶市，出口行仍以急趕船期，問津奇佳，因此交易在數重熱烈之買風下，異常精采，售價續露秀色，而小種紅茶，猶有隨見隨銷之勢，他若白琳新紅茶，垂青者更不乏人，茲據業中人云，遷來葉茶公司對白琳新紅茶咸抱來者不拒之心思，惟該項花色，聞產區業已停工製造，因此存底日少一日，瞻望前途，尚有迭創高價之希望。</p>
<h3>國藥漲風稍</h3>
<p>日來國藥趨勢，在臺灣及廣帮大量採辦下，各貨均見高價，茲因納胃已懈，且節邊銀根告緊，各方皆抱觀望，故漲風已　，交易亦見清閑。</p>

<h3>糧審會提高米價　油市消化活潑市價續漲</h3>
<p>米情店方零化甚殷，審議價格亦酌加一二千元，市勢供求尚穩，秈粳均升一二千元，惟收盤見軟，形成　早堅午懈之狀，新陰元略有到貨，價日平正，陳白元亦隨之少轉。麺粉供求兩平，第十七次米價審議會決定米價稍有變動，計白粳稻　價六萬元，門售六萬五千五百元，較前加百分之三強，洋秈社秈五萬四千元，門售五萬九千元，與前相同，埠已秈四萬七千元，門售五萬一千五百元，不變，碾秈四萬三千元，門售四萬七千元，加百分之二強，白秈三萬九千六百元，門售四萬三行，較前加百分之五弱，西貢米銷路薄弱，售價仍為四萬三千元。小麥閩甬進胃銷濃，到貨稀省，售主堅挺，價漲六七百元，北方白麥去化不爽，成交不多，被黃麥帶起三五百元，黃豆油商泉嘯納胃較好，疲面　振，間升行餘元，蠶豆來源雖然不及前昨湧旺，奈去化不振，依然回小三五百元，苞米青島略有問津，止跌　漲，加起千元。油市浮華活潑，到不敵消，生油豆油均加一二千元，茶油亦升千元。清油胃呆平正，豆併仍趨下游之勢。</p>

<h3>發刊辭</h3>
<p>— 吳國楨</p>
<p>本市爲世界六大都市之一，然市內交通狀况殊未足與其他都市媲美。蓋以本市過去行政機構，各不相謀，而租界方面，一切設施，初無預定計劃，任其自然發展；故市內道路系統不明，寬狹不稱，迄於今日，與車輛交通之實際情况，不能配合。復以承戰時敵僞極度摧殘之餘，公共車輛，缺乏異常，市民不得不以三輪車與人力車爲代步之工具。而三輪車之大小幾第於人力軍兩輛，今其數已達一萬五千輛之多，此爲戰前所無者。且滬南閘北第區大半毁於兵燹，工商活動，偏向中區，各種車輛內而麕集。凡此種種，皆爲造成今日中區交通特殊擁擠之主要原因。</p>
<p>本市政府對於改善中區交通秩序辦法，業經決定，將於明日起實施。其要點一爲疏導，一爲限制；即根據交通之需要與道路之寬狹，規定橫單程交通道各兩綫，並就車輛種類，規定其通行與禁行之道路及時間。良以本市車輛，自獨輪小車，兩輪人力車，三輪脚踏車，以至十輪卡車，種　至爲龐雜，以大小不一，快慢不同，形形色色之無數車輛，爭施角逐於同一道路，其不能保持良好之交通秩序，自無足怪。故以單程交通及分道行駛方法，爲之疏導，加以限制，　　改善，而意達到「秩序第一」「安全第一」之目的。</p>
<p>凡一事之成就，端賴政府與民衆之密切合作。政府無辦法，則咎在政府；政府確定辦法，而民衆不予積極協助，共同推行，則咎在民衆。關於本市交通問題，與論界每有以能吾改善爲市政府之試金石，市政府職　所在，敢不全力以赴。今茲改善中區交通辦法，業已根據實况，訂定施行，亦將以市民能否奉行爲其能否合作試金石。所望全體車輛駕駛人暨全體市民共體斯旨，協助推行，使本市之交通秩序得與世界各大城市並駕齊驅，實不勝其企望者也。</p>

<p>電影与戲劇</p>
<h3>劇本與觀衆</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>一個劇本給搬上舞臺，能得到觀衆的歡迎，是一件最理想的事情。但是很多劇本都不能够得到這個美滿的理想。這不能怪觀衆，也不能怪劇本作者，原因是知識水準不同而變成各有對象，各有愛好。</p>
<p>記得托爾斯泰的名著「黑暗的勢力」在劇專公演的時候，我在觀衆羣裏曾聽到不同的反應。</p>
<p>這劇是寫一週靑年農民被黑暗的所推動，做下了兩件錯事，一件是和他主人的女兒生了一個私孩子，在她家之前，這靑年農民把那私生子活埋了。另一件是他和主人的年輕妻子發生了暖昧行為，結果把主人活活地氣死。他居然成了一家之主。大槪的故事是這樣，但劇本所包含的「黑暗的勢力」，却隨時隨地都能使我們感覺到。劇作者寫這劇本的目的，就是要告訴觀衆，一切的罪惡並不是這年靑農民本身的罪惡，而是這「黑暗勢力」的罪惡。那麽，這「黑暗的勢力」，到底是什麽？在他的劇本中沒有明說，只是讓觀衆自己去體味和感覺。</p>
<p>托爾泰有一雙銳利的眼睛和一支鋒利的筆。他把這個別人看不到的力量看出了，並把他寫出了。這是一個把有利與靑年男女的事情。他叫靑年男女不要給這「黑暗的勢力」所籠罩，他吿訴他們：這是一件罪惡的事。但是，能接受這偉大的啓示的人能有多少呢？</p>
<p>這劇在四川江安劇專演出的時個，我所聽到不同的反應是：</p>
<p>一個中學生說：這眞是一件不愉快的事情！</p>
<p>一個傷兵說：這小子好舒服！</p>
<p>一個紳士般的人說：這還有算人嗎？</p>
<p>一個中年以上的女人，直叫：作孽，作孽！</p>
<p>從這些人的口中，我們知道他們是接受了劇中不用的東西。劇作者所要給的東西。他們不一定能够接受到。這當然是在知識水凖不同的階段裏，所必有的現象！</p>
<p>我們當然知道：球塲裏的觀衆完全是球迷，不愛好球的人是不會到球塲裏去的。到舞塲裏去的人，一定對舞有興趣，沒有興趣的人去了一兩次就沒有興緻再去了。而劇塲却不同：各社會階層的人都可以抱了娛樂的態度到劇塲裏來看戲，用他們自己的知識水準的高低去衡量劇中的一切，用目己的愛好和趣味去接受劇中的東酉。這原他觀衆們的自由，劇作者無法限制他們，或强迫他們接受劇中的某一部份。但是，一個劇作者可以在寫劇之先，就把他作品的對象認淸，也許可以使所有的觀衆得到一個共同的東西，也就是劇作者所要給的東西。</p>
<p>在劇塲中的觀衆，早於有人把他們分成三類；一是有冷靜頭腦，專以理智找尋劇中眞理的哲學家。一是易被感動的老太太。另一是抱娛樂態度而來隨意叫好的小伙子。這三類人包括了劇塲中所有的觀衆。任何一個劇的演出，能被道三類人所喜歡，那麽，它才是一個成功的劇本。</p>
<p>上海最近的話劇演出，在藝術水準的高低上暫時不說，在營業上總是虧本。營業的不佳，就是觀衆的數量少；觀衆少也就是這劇不能被觀衆接受。這就證明了這劇的演出只能滿足某一階層，或某一類的觀衆，其他的觀衆並沒有感到滿足，因此不進劇塲而影響到劇團的虧蝕，直到劇團的解散！</p>
<p>在這半年來，總結每次演出的成績和結果。我們大致可以知道：上海的觀衆是喜歡極度的刺激的：能使他們流淚的傷感劇，或是隨時笑出淚來的笑劇，他們比較能够接受兩極端的東西。那種隔於兩者之間的，哭笑不得的劇本他們不一定喜歡。尤其是水準高時，嚴肅的眞正是藝術品的東西。這，當然不是說全體觀衆都不能接受，而是說只有智識水準高的人才能接受，也就是說劇塲中三類觀衆中的一類才能接受這種眞正的藝術品。</p>
<p>例如：中電劇團演出的「大地回春」和最近上海實騐劇社演出的「春寒」，都是超過水凖的藝術，但他們都虧蝕了。這，很使我們這些戲劇工作者驚奇，為什麽這麽好的戲劇曾得到這樣悲慘的命運呢？這就說明了上海大多數觀衆的興趣和愛好。同時，也吿訴了劇團負責人，在選劇本演出的時候，假使不凖備賠本的話，譔如何地認淸他的對象！</p>
<h3>「沙漠情歌」與「好萊塢酒家」</h3>
<p>— 新嗚</p>
<p>華納公司攝成一部盛大的勞軍片「好萊塢酒家」，參加演出的女明星有蓓蒂黛維絲，瓊克勞馥，瓊李絲麗，白蓓蘭史丹妃，伊黛羅碧諾，安德羅姊妹等。男明屋有但尼斯毛根埃迪康泰，喬意勃郎，賈克裴納，保爾亨利，約翰迦飛爾等，還有著名的榮隊三班。此驚人的陣容，　空前絕後得嘆為觀止。今片共映二點鐘餘，而華納公司素以不粗製濫造，愼重製片為觀衆們稱道，如「卡薩布蘭加」，「萊茵河的守衛」等文藝片，「反攻緬甸」等戰事片，每張都使我們得到了滿足</p>
<p>「好萊塢酒家」昨日上午十時在金門戲院招待新開界人士。今日上午十時在國泰戲院放「沙漠情歌」五彩片招待新聞文化界。該片為華納公司慶祝有聲電影二十週紀念所選映。</p>
<h3>鶯飛人間故事</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>雨夜，戲院裏賓客滿座。音　樂台上，魯斯曲指揮着樂隊，柳鶯在台上歌唱。可是在戲院門外，一個靑年拿着手提琴，注視着那大照貼上巨額票價。</p>
<p>柳鷥，她是現在極負盛名的歌唱家。許多紳士聞人之流都想得到她的靑睞，可是她却厭惡這班人，總是設法避開他們。這晚上，她從戲院裏出來，巧遇了窮靑年音樂家任雲。任雲到了柳鶯家裏，要求她唱一隻歌給他欣賞，柳鶯答應了。</p>
<p>在任雲的家裏，他和大批工友們正欲開始演奏音樂。並把柳鶯唱歌給他聽的事，當衆宣怖出來，可是誰都不信，結果由任雲的老友劉祺提議；要他在星期六晚上的大節目裏，把柳鶯請來一起參加，任雲答應了，於是，演奏才開始。</p>
<p>魯斯曲是柳鶯的老師，是一個落伍的老音樂家，他反對柳鶯和無名的任雲來往，可是柳鶯却不以為然。</p>
<p>任雲寫了一封信拾柳鶯，約她在星期六晚上來參加他們的演奏會。</p>
<p>星期六到了，任雲和劉旗，忙着收拾屋子。柳鶯也從戲院裏趕到，大家都興高采烈地唱着，奏着，聽衆們亦都側耳靜聽，一曲唱畢；大為聽衆所歡迎。柳鶯道謝後就辭別回家，任雲陪着她在路上，柳鶯說出了她的志願；她希望能用歌聲給大衆精神上的愛，她要把她的歌唱給每個人聽，給廣大的人羣聽。任雲亦以為藝術應該是大衆化的，不應該是一種人的專有品。更不應該把它常作一件買賣的貨物！</p>
<p>柳鶯回家，魯斯曲責備她，要她和任雲斷絕往來。</p>
<p>第二天，柳鶯為了下個月又要漲票價，就和魯斯曲起了一次爭執，柳鶯說：「我的歌是藝術，是大衆所需要的藝術，不是一件貨物！」</p>
<p>任雲和劉祺計劃組織一個樂隊，到許多沒有音樂的地方去演奏。他們想請柳鶯亦加入。於是，任雲到柳鶯家裏向她提出了這個意見。不料被魯斯曲撞見。把任雲駡了出去！</p>
<p>一天，劉祺帶了一架收音機回家，許多鄰居們的孩子都趕來聽，住在樓下的莉莉亦擠了上來，可是，一不小心，就被擠出了人羣，滾下樓去，於是莉莉被送進了醫院醫藥費用，全由柳鶯給付淸了，此外還給了任雲一筆五十萬元的款子，作為組織樂隊的經費，並答應參加他們的演奏會</p>
<p>柳鶯參加了任雲組織的樂隊，用楊芸的名字，跟着樂隊在各平民區內演唱，非常地受人歡迎！</p>
<p>第二天的報紙上就登載了一則「楊芸女士慰勞平民」的新聞，魯斯曲看到了，當着柳鷥的面，表示極力反對，他說：「要是楊芸是我的學生，我絕對不許她這樣做！」</p>
<p>魯斯曲，為了要斷絕任雲和柳鶯的關係，就親自到任雲的家裏，把柳鶯和自己的關係吿訴了任雲，要任雲不再和柳鶯接近，可是任雲却說：「柳小姐已經成人，她有她自己的意旨，請問魯先生有沒有辦法去控制她的主意？魯斯曲無話可說，黯然她回家來，向椶鶯求婚，柳鶯絕對沒想到，自己的先生會向她求婚。她有些不知所措．感動地說：「我永遠不離開你！」</p>
<p>戲院門口的佈吿上寫着「修理內部，暫停演奏」，任雲怏怏地從裏面出來，後來由劉祺說柳鶯的佣人那裏，知道柳鶯和魯斯曲下鄕去了。閃中任雲就不顧一切地到鄕下野去找她了。</p>
<p>在鄕村裏，任雲找到了柳鶯，二人別後相見，更增情意。約定在元旦前再作一次演奏，柳鶯決定想法在元旦前趕回上海。</p>
<p>元旦，在一個大曠塲上。這個演奏會又一次的演出了。柳鶯參加着歌唱，恰巧小報主筆馮夢花路過於是，這個新發現就在報上用大標題登了出來：「楊芸就是柳鶯。」消息一傳出後，柳鶯戲院裏的聽衆數量就減少了。因為那些紳士們以為柳鷥的歌可以免費聽到，那還有什希奇呢？柳鶯對魯斯曲說出了她的主題，她說：「音樂是大衆愛好的東西，大家需要的食糧，為什麽不能跟陽，和水一樣地讓每個人都亨受到呢？那些紳士們的眼裏只有錢，他們把什麽都用錢去估價，他們懂得什麽藝術，他們簡直是侮辱藝術！」可是得斯曲聽了她的話，非但無動於中，却反而把她趕了出去。柳鷥投到了任雲那裏。任雲鼓勵着，叫她，不怕一切的幹去！</p>
<p>此後柳鶯就向人宣言，要到各地去流浪，發揚她的志願！任雲和地的愛情，一天天的滋長，終於結婚了。可是他們還是倒處歌唱，到處演奏，無論在孤兒院裏，養老院裏，都有他們的足</p>
<p>日子一天一天過去，他們給予人們的愛亦一天一天的發揚廣大，到處有人歡迎他們，紀念他們，他們才是眞正的藝術家！</p>
<h3>歐陽飛鶯在「鶯飛人間」中</h3>
<h3>每週電影短評</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>本週中賣座最好的是「出水芙蓉」，雖是兩度公映，仍是車水馬龍，但是國片「忠義之家」也不弱於前者。</p>
<p>忠義之家</p>
<p>劇中勝利後在劉瓊滔滔言論聲中，各色各景的影子一陣陣移去，似乎比結束的一段更好。</p>
<p>出水芙蓉</p>
<p>在大體的技巧結構上，該片算是成功的。如果用這樣分析的看法；「看五彩的塲面，雷特史基于頓的滑稽，伊瑟蕙琳絲的游水，」那麽這部片子便是一部上佳的片子。音樂配得極佳，比片中正式表演着的更佳。</p>
<p>小處不台理原為喜劇所允許，但該片前段旣述了男人是如何難進女校，但在後來又一個一個的男子莫明其妙的從窗戶內跨進雷特史基頓的臥室，這是自相矛盾處。</p>
<p>小鹿班比</p>
<p>華德狄斯耐對這部卡通是別創一格的，它沒有鮮麗的顏色，儘量接近天然；雨景，雪景，畫得極好，音樂的陪襯較之出水芙蓉尤好。</p>
<p>如果其結束能改為班比潮漸老去，那比現在接任鹿王的職位尤佳，而且不一定要改畫面。</p>
<p>直搗東京</p>
<p>卡萊葛倫沉着有力，海底炸彈一段最為精彩，割盲腸的一段。形如孤立；如說其為象徵掃除障礙，亦以用另一方法為佳，且此說法要極為勉强。在文化前進的美國醫藥豈可有如兒戲，艇中那可沒有軍醫？</p>
<p>不過，此片在海軍片中，算是好的。</p>
<p>偵探小姐</p>
<p>插曲三支都極勉强，鏡頭極力捧足狄安娜賽萍，同一時問，近影特寫極多。故事除唱歌外的穿插，不壞。</p>
<p>演員中，愛德華霍登很好，狄安娜稱職而已，不及「當差的妹妹」。但比「一見傾心」友「美鳳奪鸞」等諸片為佳。</p>
<p>雙槍水牛陣</p>
<p>最總括的批評，這部片子比「雙槍獨行俠」好。編尷安插一理髮匠兼新聞記者的人物，最有意思。</p>
<p>康絲登裴納老了，勃魯斯卡卜與華倫威廉都稱職。</p>
<p>加映的短片極佳，都是舊日好萊塢歌舞大塲面的片斷，其中游泳池畔一節，如加上色彩，不會輸給「出水芙蓉。」</p>
<p>亂世創俠</p>
<p>末塲擊劍，精彩；前段賣珠寶，尚佳，再前段就不行了。</p>
<p>演員</p>
<p>這一週好演員實在少，上週原列第三的卡萊著葛本週可升為第一。</p>
<p>（一）卡萊葛倫（在「直搗東京」中）</p>
<p>（二）雪特史基頓（在「出水芙蓉」中</p>
<p>（三）　頭鷹與兎子（在「小鹿班比」中）</p>
<p>特出値得在此處提出的。</p>

<h3>秋夜的蟲聲</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>你歡喜聽秋夜的蟲聲嗎？</p>
<p>我覺得秋夜的蟲聲，真像一羣熟練可愛的小樂工，在空壙的野地上舉行熱鬧的大合奏。</p>
<p>把愁思丟開，把心　關起，把所有的康世俗事　却在茫茫九霄雲間，只剩下一個朦朦矓矓的靈魂，沉浸在水一樣澄清的境界裏。那時節，你決不會咬牙切齒的恨你的仇敵；也不會用細細的筆悍寫什麼無聊的詩句；更不會憤慨唏噓或者流淚。你只會微微地笑，讓一朶朶記憶的鮮花開遍在「吱啊……吱啊……」的樂聲裏。</p>
<p>假使你是一位有鬍髭的先生，你仍會記起郊外的綠草，野花，泥墩，石塊和騎在牛背上的好伴侶。……</p>
<p>假使你是一位白髪斑斑的太太，你仍會記起庭前的明月，姐姐的微笑，媽媽的低柔的催眠曲。……</p>
<p>至於我呢？告訴你，我還會記起那類蟆蟆糊糊的故事：</p>
<p>什麼在遙遠的從前，有一個懶惰的窮婦，每天丈夫叫他織布，他總偷偷把紗藏起，一點不織，後來有一天丈夫病了，叫她把織好的布拿出去賣掉了換米，她掌不出，丈夫怒極了，一刀砍死了她。於是就從那一年起，每到秋天的夜裏總有一種小小的蟲兒，在野地裏叫着，聲音像織布，人們稱牠織布為「紡織娘」，據說就是那個懶惰的女人在懺悔，在哀哭流淚。</p>
<p>你要笑這種故事的荒誕吧？我也笑得合不攏嘴來呢！</p>
<p>秋夜的蟲聲，確是怪可愛的，希望你能够留神聽聽。</p>
<h3>林先生</h3>
<p>— 謝北城</p>
<p>林先生把那張紙條子看了一眼，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「茲收到尊師捐款一萬五千元整，此具。」</p>
<p>他躊躇一下，提起筆來在上面簽上三個字：林如海。他看着這三個秀麗的字有些傷心，自從十三歲臨趙松雪，到如今三十多了，比趙松雪也許比不過，比起「乾隆御筆那種柔若無骨的字可強多了。可是現在還得要等着這一萬五千塊的尊師捐款用。</p>
<p>有一點赧然，紅着臉把那紙條遞給會計先生，用一本練習　揮搧着：</p>
<p>「好熱」</p>
<p>好像是天太熱，抵頭寫宇低得太久，血都湧到頭上來了。</p>
<p>會計先生沒有留神這些，祇顧低着頭數鈔票，數一遍再數一遍，數一遍，再數一遍，數一遍，再數一遍，數個沒有完，那樣子就好像一個為職務困擾得神經衰弱了的老郵務員，看着售出去的郵票和收進來的鈔票，眼睛發花。</p>
<p>數了半天，站在旁邊的林如海先生早看清楚了：一千塊錢的票子五張，四百塊的五張，五百塊的六張，一五得五，四五二十，五六三十，一共是一萬塊錢。好容易數完了，抬起頭來，把票子塞在林先生的手裏：</p>
<p>「小意思，小意思，哈，學生們的玩意兒！」</p>
<p>林先生的乎有點發抖，他還沒有來得及想點別的事，會計先生就把嘴巴遞到林先生的耳朵邊，吱吱喳喳然後用他那粗重的巴掌用力的在林先生的肩膀上拍一下，大聲的說：</p>
<p>「這林先生一定是樂隨的，譬如沒有這一當子事，下學期的聘書今天早晨校長已經叫我發出去了，林先生回家好收到了……。」　他喘一口氣，彷彿在想什麼，突然又眯着兩隻細眼：</p>
<p>「下學期學費漲了。初小十二萬，高小十五萬，教職員待遇呢？，自然，自然哈……」</p>
<p>林先生把苦笑掛在嘴角上，端起那一萬塊錢的尊師捐款—自然，收條上可是寫的一萬五千元—向會計先生點點頭：</p>
<p>「再會，再會！」</p>
<p>把脚跨出亭子間的門檻，他想起一件事情來，就把頭回過去，差一點讓樓梯拐壞了脚面：</p>
<p>「下學期那一天開學，還沒有訂？」</p>
<p>會計先生衝着他，咧着嘴壞笑：」</p>
<p>「林先生是老先生了，問得太外行，招生廣告上定的是八月廿五日，自然，自然……」</p>
<p>［還要延幾天？」</p>
<p>「學生不够就等幾天，九月中總開課了，大熱天多歇幾天也妤！」</p>
<p>林先生的心裏有一點鬱悶，早想要想法子改善一下環境，但是：肚子咕嚕一響，有一點餓了。</p>
<p>手裏的一萬塊錢也許可以吃七八碗排骨麵，但是，哎，初小的學費也要十二萬了，家裏小玲子那孩子……他差一點沒哭出米，——可憐的孩子，你投錯了胎，這學期怕要輟學了。</p>
<p>會計先生的話在他的耳邊響：</p>
<p>「教職員的待遇呢？自然，自然……」</p>
<p>心底裏有一個光亮亮的太陽照進去，是一個大晴天，他相信了一句話！「水漲船高，船到橋頭自會直。」一切都是有辦法的，天下沒有過不去的關。</p>
<p>不過他還捨不得拿這一萬元裏的幾分之幾去吃一碗排骨麵，他小心的摸着那裝着一萬塊錢的口袋，儘在街上，生怕那十六張花紙頭生着翅膀飛出來。</p>
<p>今天又是一個大晴天，所以太陽照在街上很亮，不過又熱起來了，林先生的頭上淌着汗，離家可還有一程子路呢，這幾年身子乏了，走一點點路就覺得累，找一個什麼地方歇一歇纔好。</p>
<p>大陽剛有一點偏斜，街上蔭涼的地方很少，他擦着牆邊走過去，突然有什麼東西吸引住他：</p>
<p>那牆上用紅色的水彩筆寫着：「冷氣開放」！</p>
<p>在上面還有都城大戲院，自然也有今日開映之類，這些林先生都不感興趣，他最感興趣的是在那售票櫃外面的廣廳中歇一會，戲場中漏出來的冷氣，已經够沁人心脾了。</p>
<p>他推開廣亮的玻璃大門走進去，電影第一傷還沒有散場，離第二場開映的時候還早，廣廳中祇有三三兩兩四五個人——兩個一男一女指指戳戳的在那邊看畫片，三個兩女一男倚在門角上講笑話。</p>
<p>林先生肚子裏想：</p>
<p>「真是電影迷，這樣早就跑來等着開映，真是要不得的小布爾喬亞」！</p>
<p>他記得在那一本新文藝書上有這麼一句。不過那邊那三個年青人正直瞪着眼望着他，他便也不得不裝做「要不得的小布爾喬亞」，到窗邊上去看畫片。</p>
<p>林先生可沒有心情看這撈什仔的畫片，他在這裏歇一會還要去看剛送到家裏去的聘書，還有小玲子的學費……</p>
<p>林先生的胳膊肘讓別人碰了一下子：</p>
<p>「先生……」</p>
<p>林先生嚇了一大跳，定睛往前面一看，自己也正直瞪着兩隻眼望着一張畫片，上面畫着一個標緻的女人正讓一個小鬍子摟在懷裏用力的吻着。他的臉噏的一下子紅了起來。</p>
<p>他紅着臉往旁邊望一下子：</p>
<p>一個女孩子——就是那三個要不得的小布爾喬亞其中的一個——站在他的旁邊，手裏捧着一大疊什麼書：</p>
<p>「先生買一本吧，帮助窮學生的！」</p>
<p>林先生望望那本書，他對於這種書本生疎，並且——他又把手摸在口袋上，那一萬塊錢還在。</p>
<p>「先生，買一本吧，兩千洋鈿一本，帮助窮學生升學……」</p>
<p>林先生實在為難，早知道不進來乘涼，呸，還裝做小布爾喬亞的樣子！呸，呸，呸！</p>
<p>他掙扎了好半響，迸出幾個字來：</p>
<p>「我是一個窮教書匠！」—好難為情！</p>
<p>那女孩子可不難為情，真難為他會說：</p>
<p>「先生太客氣，做老師的人都希望窮學生能升學，並且只當多看一場電影！」</p>
<p>林先生恨不得打自己兩個嘴巴子，幾時看過一場電影呢？為什麼自己偏偏要到電影院來乘涼歇脚！</p>
<p>沒有法子，把兩千塊錢塞在女孩子的手裏，換來那本對自己怪生疎的書——真是剜了林先生的肉！——不再乘涼了，越待下去汗珠子越往外冒</p>
<p>他匆匆的溜出都城大戲院計算着，收條上的一萬五千元整已經少去一半了，還有小玲子的學費呢？……</p>
<p>心底裏的太陽又亮了起來：「教職員的待遇呢？自然，自然……」</p>
<p>他得趕快回去看聘書，他進門的時候，聘書靜靜的躺在書桌上，那上面寫着：</p>
<p>「……下學期擬聘先生為五年級級任，薪金暫訂每月八萬五千元整……」</p>
<p>林先生嘆一口氣大聲的喊：「小玲子，你也去請求助學金吧！」</p>

<h3>音樂家的生涯</h3>
<p>— 嘉惠</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰初期，有一首燴炙人口的歌叫「遙遠的狄白拉里」（It's　a　Long，Long　Way　to　Tipperary）這首歌可說是最流行的軍歌，但牠的作者傑克·佐其（Jack　Juige）為了生活，日間要趕魚市，晚上還要粉墨登場。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風　26</p>
<p>「民國二十二年，我們又在瀋陽見了面，我正是幹着××社日本分社的通訊記者，不過，實底子上是一個情報和記者的兩棲式自由寫作者。那時，一大部分日本陰謀，尤其是日本對於國聯調查團佈置的陰謀，可說大部分是給我設法揭露的。……</p>
<p>「然而功勞却是全虧鶴見玉的努力，（對不起，我在這種危險的環境下工作，第一點，簡直就要徹底把承志當作一個純粹日本血統；就是做夢，都不能露出一絲漏洞，必得一直「鶴見」下去）。……</p>
<p>「原來，就在他參加派遣軍參謀總部實習的那一年，他的養母就去世了。回國安排喪事的假期成了他一生事業的大轉捩點——在他養母的箱底，他發現了一本記事冊和他令尊的幾封乎跡，特別是那封臨危時寫的長信。同時他劉於土肥原之類的「破落戶」作風，本米就不造成；加上無意之中，發覺他原來是個嫡嫡正正的黃帝子孫，自己的父親，又是一位革命先導，所以他打定主意，要替祖國，好好的報仇雪恨，做下一番大事業來。……</p>
<p>「結果，他才自己決定担任了這個危險之上加上危險，秘密之中又加秘密的脚色。然而基本的問題，他必得首先把自己脚跟站得牢牢地，才能於中取事。為了這，他集中目標在通訊課的一點上。因為這是一個一切消息的總樞紐。至終其他職位方面，他知道，照他的年齡，無論如何，爬不到很高。位置既不能高，那麼鷄零狗碎，偷偷摸摸地打聽一點隔夜消息，何濟於事呢？……因此，他才選定了通訊課這個位置。……</p>
<p>「一年多的埋頭苦幹，代發明了一種特殊秘碼，比較原有的靈妙，而又絕無弊端。就因為這個功勞，立時就升了級，做了電訊課副課長。我們見面的當口，他已經是正課長了。同時他還物色了一些同志——「複雜」性的同志，慢慢地工作起來。……</p>
<p>「至於兄弟個人串演的脚色，是兩個名義；一個是他們人的秘書，一個是中國事顧問。他又替我造了一些勞績，就為要堅定他們那些鬼魅的信託，鞏固我的地位，所以「岳樣」這個名稱，在參謀總部，是通行得過的」。</p>
<p>「佩服，佩服」。W君連聲稱贊，「怪得我們連連收到KCC的神秘報告，原來是這麼一回事。可喜得很，如此，我們特務工作的第一綫，可說已經推進到他們的參謀本部裏去了」！</p>
<p>「話是可以這麼說，祇是日本鬼，詭許多端，加之內部也是鷄夫鴨妻，不和得很；所以，就以我們這種地位，有時也祇能探到全部悄報的十之四五。還有，黑龍會一方面，那是一個秘密工作的大本營，鶴見雖有些聯絡，也低是一種互相利用的玩意，現在他很想正式加入，祇要他的頂頭上司××肯幫忙的話。」……</p>
<p>—以上是我同W君見面談話的大概，因為事隔八九年，記憶不能十分準確，而且對白又很瑣碎，不能依照原來對話情形寫出。您想，W君是一們忙中的忙人，不到幾分鐘就有電話，電訊。分撥事工，還有必需親自對付的事項等等，教們這短短幾十分鐘的談話，破裂了不下二三十回，所有談話免不了一些重複和插景，我要一點一劃的記下來，恐怕您也不耐煩這些瑣碎吧。</p>
<p>—臨動身，W君把打開了的門，重又關上：</p>

<p>人生雜談</p>
<h3>友誼是什麽</h3>
<p>我們都是凡人，不能解脫六根六塵。往往受了委曲或煩惱時，想有一個知友，倒入他懷中大哭一場。這種無形的感覺，就是表示友誼的需要。</p>
<p>不過友誼的存在，我以為第一須去掉利害關係。所謂利害關係是指義務上，法律上或是貿易上的約束。因此父子，兄弟……有時難以生友誼，父子不能新暱，倒不是年齡的殊懸，而是父不能對子言紅樓夢，九尾龜，而子不能對父談羅曼史，彼此帶了三分虛偽的尊嚴或服從；二者之間，一生虛假，毫無情誼可言了；兄弟為爭奪同一目的物而嫉妬猜忌。此二者皆不能產生至誠之情誼。</p>
<p>我人不能自小交友起，直交至老死，既非今人不及古人重義氣，而是環境使然。我記得中學裏與某君是對床夜話的朋友，但是為環境所迫，我們分手了，到現今不通信息。這是我的叛離嗎？是他的沒有信義嗎？</p>
<p>所以純粹的友誼以莊子解釋得最妙。他說：「相視而哭，莫逆於心」。這種友誼才算到家。除了這種心與心相通外，再要你須要我，我須要你。</p>
<p>韓愈說：「獨學無友則陋」。我們可以把這學字廣義的解釋一下，譬如二個愛皮黃的朋友，未嘗不可談談梅蘭芳，還有一點就是友誼並不是一定建立在兩人的個性上，約翰克里斯多夫（註一）與奧里維算得是至友了，可是他們個性並不相同，一個是剛強的德國血統，另一個却是陰柔的法國血統。又像大衛考伯菲爾與斯蒂爾福（註二），前者胆怯文雅，後者魯莽庸俗，他們也生了至情。從來大衛能不記其惡但記其善，所以我以為個性不同不是友誼之阻礙，不過這距離不能差得太遠，而要看兩人的幽默感與容忍惑如何了。</p>
<p>愛羅先珂說：「小鷄總還是和小鵝玩要的好，而小鴨便去和小鴨」。所以你假如是個戲迷，那末我希望你與票友做朋友，如果你有幽默感或容忍惑，則三月以後你也會幾句「西皮二黃」了。</p>
<p>友誼之發生，不像男女愛情那樣麻煩，友誼不分貧富（如賈竇玉與泰鍾），不分國籍（如羅曼羅蘭與托爾斯泰，福爾拜與屠格湼夫），不分古今（如王國維與李後主，林語堂與袁中道）。在航程上，在逆旅中，在工廠或學校裏，我們可以隨時找到我們的了解者。</p>
<p>說得可怕些，一個沒有朋友者，一定患有精神病的。</p>

<h3>此風可長</h3>
<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>日昨本市訊：「俄人向公用局第四處職員郭子卿行賄，為郭君所拒，事為聯總專員兼運輸主任楊森（西人）所親見，楊森氏特函該局趙局長報告，並致欽佩之意」。</p>
<p>你們對這件新聞感覺怎樣？雖公務員不受賄是分內事，但在這「貪污年」中，倒是值得我們歌頌的。</p>
<p>的確，回顧勝利已屆一年，在報章上看見的到處是××億元大舞弊案，××貪污案，××受賄案，……，多得不足為奇；現在有一件拒賄新聞，好比平常吃厭了前菜肴，換了一個口味。</p>
<p>外國人士對我國的評論，一致認為貪污案件，比比皆是；印象太惡，現在郭君的清廉，居然給外人所親見，確是非同小可。</p>
<p>在今日我國的社會上，清廉的風氣太不普遍了，我們除對郭君致敬外，並應高呼：拒賄之風可長！</p>
<h3>藍色多瑙河</h3>

<p>某校新生考試的史地試題中有一題為：歐洲有那條著名的河流？</p>

<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 三公</p>
<p>市政府推行清潔區制實施辦法中設明：「……力求街巷之清潔並清除以往積存之垃圾。」其實「以往積存」而亟待清除者豈僅垃圾已乎？</p>
<p>「眾人頭上刮」，理應受人詛駡，惟有因救難而「刮」，倒是一件值得稱頌的事，而且希望大「刮」特「刮」，愈多愈好。</p>
<p>八年苦難，迄今「難」猶未盡，不特做老子的衣食住行樣樣「難」，即連做兒子的讀書亦遭到空前大「難」。</p>
<p>上月份市府的支出項目中，教育文化僅佔百分之九·九四，而保警費却佔百分之二六·五六。我害怕有那麼一天，馬路上的警察居然比學生還要多！</p>
<h3>你認識「錢」嗎？</h3>
<p>— 莫高</p>
<p>不是向人去要錢，是向我們的勞力去取錢！</p>
<p>對錢的認識，就是認織人生的開始。</p>
<p>不用勞力得來的錢，是別人的汗！別人的淚！別人的血！</p>
<p>有錢的人不一定幸福，無錢的人不一定痛苦。</p>
<p>敵人永遠是人的敵人！</p>
<p>假使世界上有吃人的魔鬼，這魔鬼就是錢。</p>
<p>對於妄想錢的，終於要被這魔鬼送了命。</p>
<p>本來世男上不會有奴隸的。因為。錢被撐握在少數惡人手裏；</p>
<p>於是脆弱的人們屈服了。</p>
<p>有錢的人，錢會生錢。</p>
<p>沒有錢的人，錢會吃錢。</p>
<p>不能以貌來以人，亦不能以錢來看人。</p>

<h3>關于革新英語教學</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>教育部為改進中學英語教學，曾在渝召開」英語教學研究會」兩次，日前又在京舉行第三次會議，出席有校長，教授及教育部有關人員，各家主張，大致可以分為下列各要點：</p>
<p>（一）初中英語注重講，讀，寫之初步訓練？高中側重閱讀能力之培養，會話，寫作次之。</p>
<p>（二）高初中均定英語為必修科目，每週授課六小時。</p>
<p>（三）由部組織「中學英語教學研究委員會」，以資改進。</p>
<p>（四）擬自明年起舉辦英語專校，以訓練中學英語教師專門人材。</p>
<p>由此看來，可見英語教學已被國教育界重視。根據中華民國二十三年九月八日教育部公佈，高中課程表所列，高中三年修學期內，英語授課，每週為五小時。二十五年二月十八日修正公佈，中學課程標準所載：商中英語，每週仿授課五小時，初中為四小時。今後將一律增為每週六小時。</p>
<p>我以為：此次教育部計劃革新中學英語教學，就學業立場，是無可非議。但其他原有課程仍應保持均勻比例，不宜有所偏廢，否則用意雖善，恐不免為少數人所中傷，作為別有用心宣傳的「口實」。</p>

<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 7th] The headquarters of Generalissimo Ma began investigating on the 7th the bombing by aircraft of the eleventh group of the Peiping Executive Headquarters on August 29 when the Communist army withdrew from Chengde.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 7th] Four aircraft of the Executive Headquarters left here today for Chengde to rescue the eleventh executive group led by Fu Zeng, which was strafed by aircraft in Weichang. The whereabouts of the group is still unknown. One of the aircraft carries personnel and doctors from the Executive Headquarters, as well as other communication equipment.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiangyin, This Newspaper, 7th] Rumors have been rampant here in recent days, and merchants and civilians are moving south.

<h3>In Tong-Ru Area, Communist Army Forbids Harvesting of Crops</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nantong, This Newspaper, 6th] After the Communist army attacked Linzi, southeast of Rugao, the garrison transferred its position for strategic reasons. The Communist army in the town has recently ordered the demolition of surplus houses from the people within a time limit, otherwise they will be severely punished. Recently, it has also ordered the people not to cut down high-stalk crops in the fields, to use them for concealment. They are also forcibly conscripting men in the Chemahu area in southern Rugao, concentrating them in Nanmatang, Motou, Yanghuaqiao, and Liujiadu, and claiming they will attack Rugao.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Rugao, This Newspaper] After Yongguansha in Rugao was occupied by the Communist army, all farmland was completely divided up by the Communist army.

<h3>New Policies to be Implemented in Recovered Counties of Hebei Province</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 7th] As the Nationalist army in Hebei Province advances smoothly, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided on a major policy to engage in political struggle with the Communist Party. This new policy concerns the land issue in the recovered counties, and it is decided to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching of "land to the tiller." Poor farmers who originally had land divided under the Communist Party's rule will continue to use the land they have divided after the Nationalist army recovers it, and the local authorities must not take it back. However, the landlords still retain "ownership." It is generally believed that this policy, if implemented thoroughly, will have a significant impact. Sun Zhenbang, Director of the Hebei Civil Affairs Department, has ordered administrative personnel to advance with the army to the recovered areas and has personally gone to eastern Hebei to instruct on everything.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Discusses Impressions After Inspecting Rehe</h3>

(3) The Communist army has implemented liquidation, so that the rich become poor and the poor go bankrupt. (4) Economic bankruptcy has led to a large number of refugees who are in urgent need of relief. (5) The autumn harvest this year is abundant, and farmers can spend the winter safely.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhengchun, Commander of the Communist Army's Coastal Defense Area in Eastern Hebei, Defects with His Troops; More than 10,000 People Surrender and Join the Nationalist Army</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Tianjin, Central News Agency, 7th] Yang Zhengchun, commander of the Communist Army's Coastal Defense Area in Eastern Hebei, Chief of Staff Liu Fengxu, together with Sun Shengsan, Commissioner of the Eastern Hebei Special Administrative Office, defected with more than 10,000 troops and militiamen, and sent representatives to Peiping to discuss surrender matters. It is reported that Yang's unit was established in the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Finally, it moved from Ninghe to the area of Nanbei Zhaogezhuang in Fengrun. Since the defection, the unit has been pursued by the 13th Brigade of the Communist New Fourth Army. The defecting part has been coordinating with the Nationalist army to fight them. Yang Zhengchun has also personally gone to Peiping to meet with Director Li to report everything and issued a circular telegram, the original text of which is as follows: "Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the national affairs have been in turmoil. All of us Chinese people have been inspired to volunteer to kill the enemy and be pioneers for the people. Zhengchun and others, originally a humble martial artist and a later descendant of Yugam, gathered armed comrades and resolutely rose up. Later, we were confused by the theory of the national united anti-Japanese front and joined the Eighth Route Army. Over the past eight years, we have fought on the coast, with no fewer than 300 battles and repeatedly defeating strong enemies. Later, we were shocked by the Communist Party's order to wander without attacking, retreating as the enemy advanced, eliminating dissidents, and annihilating the Central Army. We did not know what to do. However, compelled by the situation and to ensure the overall anti-Japanese situation, we dared not express dissent. Fortunately, the country regained its light and the War of Resistance was victorious, and the rivers and mountains were restored, and all the people rejoiced. Who would have thought that the Communist Party would suddenly change its course, establish its own political orders, seize cities and land, and attack the Nationalist army, without end, destroying railways, wantonly killing innocent people, destroying fields and burning houses, conscripting men, cutting off transportation, village cadres acting tyrannically, those who harbor resentment being abandoned, poor parties acting rampant, those who whisper being executed. Who has no parents, forced to embark on the path of struggle? Who has no sisters, humiliated by being conscripted for comfort? This has led loyal and kind people to abandon their homes and flee far away, with their families scattered and wandering in foreign lands. Every time Zhengchun thinks of this, he is filled with anger and wants to die. Later, with the Central Government's leniency, it has repeatedly convened peace conferences. Zhengchun had hoped for a satisfactory solution, the cessation of war, and the heavy task of jointly building the country. However, there are great mistakes. The negotiations have stopped, and the Chinese Communist Party's aim of long-term talks is a plan to delay. Attacking cities and looting warehouses is what they are doing now. They are ordered to destroy the Beining Railway, occupy nearby strongholds, steal and attack the Nationalist army, and launch a civil war. Zhengchun believes that the world situation is extremely chaotic, and the survival of the country is at stake. The Communist Party's actions are truly heartbreaking. The people are aroused and can no longer bear it. We have decided to immediately lead our officers and soldiers, more than 10,000 people, to defect and await orders from the Central Government, to uphold the unified government, to eliminate the plotters of constitutional nations, to eliminate the unfilial Communist bandits, to be of one heart and one mind, and to forever obey the Central Government's will. These are our humble intentions."</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 7th] Although the five representatives of the informal five-person group are all in Beijing, contact activities have apparently come to a standstill again due to Special Envoy Marshall's trip to Guling. The current situation seems to be waiting for Special Envoy Ma to fly to Guling to report and for Zhou Enlai to expect a reply from Yan'an before a final decision can be made, so hope has been pinned on the next few days again. Recently, the Communist Party has repeatedly hyped up a bad atmosphere, and there are more pessimistic views. However, how exactly it will be, it is feared that it will only become clear after Special Envoy Marshall returns to Beijing. Also, it was rumored yesterday that Ambassador Stuart would be flying to Shanghai on the 7th, but it is now known that this will not become a reality within days.

As for the purpose of General Gillem's trip, the US military has not announced it.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, Central News Agency, 7th] British Ambassador Sir Stevenson received reporters from the Central News Agency alone on the morning of the 7th and solemnly denied again that the British side would participate in China's peace talks.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The Hebei High Court announced the death sentence for Wang Yitang on the 7th. Due to Wang's physical inability to move, the sentencing was held in a temporary court within the First Prison. At 11:00 AM, prison guards carried Wang out of his cell. After customary inquiries, Presiding Judge He Chengzhuo stood up and read the main text of the verdict: "Wang Yitang colluded with the enemy to plot against the country, engaging in treason against his own nation, sentenced to death, deprived of all civil rights for life, all assets confiscated except for a reasonable amount to provide for the necessary living expenses of his family." He also informed Wang that he had the right to appeal. Wang remained silent throughout. He was then carried back to his cell. It is generally expected that Wang Dao, who previously requested execution in court, will not appeal. The death penalty may be carried out quickly, but it is also possible that it will not be carried out immediately, and Wang may die at any moment, as Wang's current physical and mental state is already close to death. Wang's eldest son, Deyan, and second son, Deyin, are both in Spain. His third son, Derui, is engaged in business in India and Burma. His two daughters are married and reside in Shanghai. They recently came to Beiping and are staying at the German Hospital, seemingly waiting quietly to handle their father's affairs. Wang's old residence at No. 3 Zhao Tangzi Hutong, with its carved beams and painted rafters, is covered in dust, and the courtyard is desolate. No family members remain there. A notice from the reception office of the Eleventh War Zone Headquarters has been posted on the door.</p>

<h3>Executive Headquarters Review Meeting Concludes Today; Jiang Tingfu Announced Important Decisions Yesterday; Negotiating Food Exchange Methods with the Ministry of Food</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Executive Headquarters work review meeting held its third general assembly on the morning of the 7th, hearing reports from various sub-groups. After the meeting, Director-General Jiang Tingfu announced that the conference would close on the afternoon of the 8th, hoping that the meeting could proceed quickly and that the heads of the various sub-headquarters could quickly return to their original posts. He continued, stating that he would give careful consideration to the resolutions made by the various sub-groups and would do his best to comply. However, due to the difficulties of transportation and special resources, he dared not promise full compliance. In other words, the sub-group resolutions were not binding. Then, the conveners of the Relief and other five sub-groups reported separately, and Director-General Jiang expressed his views on the reports of each sub-group. Jiang announced at the meeting: (1) Important decision: the headquarters is currently negotiating food exchange methods with the Ministry of Food to reduce transportation costs and find transportation. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, the seventh sub-group continued to meet to discuss the liaison between the operations of the various sub-headquarters. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Director-General Jiang convened a symposium of the heads of the various sub-headquarters to discuss administrative issues. The review meeting is scheduled to hold its fourth general assembly on the morning of the 8th, to hear reports from the sixth and seventh groups, and Deputy Director-General Zhuo will report on the experience of attending the Fifth General Assembly of the United Relief in Washington. The closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Resettlement of Refugees to End by Year's End</p>
<p>The first to report among the sub-groups was the Relief Group. Convener emphasized the resettlement of refugees, and the group resolved that all refugee resettlement would be handled until the end of this year. If there are excessive numbers of refugees, insufficient transportation, or a practical necessity, it can be continued until the end of March next year. Regarding the resettlement of overseas Chinese, it was decided to begin immediately, tentatively until the end of May next year as an initial conclusion, and if necessary, it can be extended as appropriate, and priority should be given to the resettlement of overseas Chinese engineers and those who have already gathered at Haikou. Jiang instructed on this matter: The resettlement of refugees in North China must be determined based on the railway transportation situation, and secondly, it must be based on whether their hometowns are peaceful; otherwise, they will still be refugees after returning home.</p>
<p>Hoping to Overcome the Food Crisis</p>
<p>When the convener of the Agricultural Rehabilitation Sub-group reported, Jiang instructed the group: The Executive Headquarters must repay 10 billion yuan to the Central Bank every month starting in October, which is economically difficult. Therefore, it is hoped that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry can take more responsibility in this regard. He continued to explain that the United Relief is still needed for assistance with food in order to overcome the difficulties of June, July and August next year.</p>
<p>Principles Proposed for the Allocation of Machinery</p>
<p>The Industrial and Mining Rehabilitation Sub-group was reported by Zhang Ziyue. Regarding the application of various factories for the allocation of machinery, the group proposed the following principles: (1) Industrial and mining enterprises in the recovered areas that have been damaged can apply; (2) It is limited to restoring to the pre-war situation. In terms of pricing, efforts should be made to be fair. In terms of payment methods, it is proposed to pay 15% to 25% initially, with the balance to be paid in installments, with a term of five to ten years. Jiang's instructions on this matter were: The industrial and mining industry is a productive industry and should serve the interests of the entire people, and should not only consider the private interests of a few people. Furthermore, the Executive Headquarters is not responsible for wartime loss compensation. Regarding the payment in installments, Jiang also believed that there were difficulties, as it was impossible to predict what the currency and prices would evolve into in the future, and the Executive Headquarters itself was a short-term institution. Some sub-headquarters will be closed next year. After the Executive Headquarters is closed, the future income should be allocated to local health undertakings.</p>
<p>Health Reports Attract the Most Attention</p>
<p>The health report was the issue that attracted the most attention at the conference. The Executive Headquarters decided to ask the Ministry of Health to take charge of this matter. Jiang said: "I have always attached great importance to health undertakings, but now I have reached a stage where I am powerless. If I cannot raise funds, tell me to kidnap and rob. I will do it," and cited the example of someone advocating robbing the golden Bodhisattva during the revolution, hoping that those present could tell him the location of the golden Bodhisattva. His words were humorous and poignant, and the atmosphere at the meeting lightened up a lot. Jiang also warned the heads of the various sub-headquarters that the expenses of the sub-headquarters would be adjusted, and hoped that they could do their best to economize.</p>
<p>Streamlining Procedures for Transportation, Procurement, and Sales</p>
<p>Finally, Liu Hongsheng reported on the review of the proposals of the Materials Transportation, Distribution, Procurement, and Sales Sub-group. In addition to mentioning that the transportation fee of 43,400,000 yuan was difficult to raise, he put forward two points, hoping that the various sub-headquarters could simplify procedures to save expenses. Liu believed that the biggest problem at present was the failure to entrust specialized people to handle specialized business, resulting in most of the transportation, procurement, and sales being handled by merchants. At the same time, the use of landing craft to transport materials also had many shortcomings. However, he guaranteed that 100,000 tons of materials could be transported to Hankou. After his speech, Jiang made a concluding remark: "We work one day, so we transport for one day. Therefore, transportation work must not be ignored, and the amount of materials that each sub-headquarters will receive in the future depends on the speed and quantity of its transportation. Any warehouse with accumulated materials will not be supplied with materials by the headquarters." Jiang expressed great dissatisfaction with transportation, believing that the highway transportation team had failed and must be reorganized, and he would not hesitate to cancel it.</p>
<p>Jiang Announced Important Facts</p>
<p>Jiang finally announced an important fact, that is, in order to avoid the food that the headquarters had worked so hard to transport to various places from being requisitioned by the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Food having to find a way to transport it out again, suffering both ways, it was negotiating exchange methods with the Ministry of Food to save transportation costs and tools for transporting other materials. This matter is justified and is bound to be carried out. Therefore, he asked the various sub-headquarters to provide the locations for exchanging food so as to negotiate with the Ministry of Food.</p>
<h3>Hebei-Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan Investigation Team Continues to Uncover Hidden Reporting Cases; Concealment of Antiques Being Investigated for Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The Hebei-Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan Investigation Team announced on the 7th: On the 6th, a case of hidden reporting of received materials was uncovered overnight. The case involved Mao Jichuan, director of the Beijing Yanjing Paper Mill, which was taken over by the Ministry of Economy, and two others who failed to report the receipt of three cars, two tricycles, and various machines such as a polishing machine and a filtration machine. The three were arrested and released on bail pending trial. When inquiring about the case, workers at the factory also reported that the former factory director, Jia Chenghe, had also privately transported a large amount of furniture and stolen and sold scrap iron. After investigation, it was confirmed that the three were handed over to the court for interrogation. The team, based on a secret report, learned that before returning to Japan, the famous Japanese antique collector, Hori Yasuaki, handed over more than 1,000 pieces of antiques and ancient books from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, including Zhou Tripods, to the Hebei-Tianjin Regional Office of the Ministry of Education. However, the office has not yet handed over these antiques and ancient books, which are stored in the Jinggu Zhai Antique Shop in Liulichang, Beiping, to the Disposal Bureau. The team is currently investigating responsibility. Special Commissioner Shen Jianshi and Wang Renyuan, who was previously responsible for the takeover (currently the chairman of the Tianjin Youth Employment Guidance Committee), are pushing responsibility onto each other.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 6th] According to a secret report from the people to the Shandong-Henan Regional Investigation Team, Zhou Ziqin, an advisor to the Shandong Provincial Government, was involved in an embezzlement case.

<h3>Sensational Fraud Case in Hankou University Adjudicated Yesterday by the Hankou District Court</h3>
<p>More Than a Hundred Creditors Crowded in to Listen</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 7th] The sensational fraud case involving Zhang Fengshi and Wang Yifei in Wuhan has been repeatedly investigated and searched by the Criminal Court of the Hankou District Court, which took a lot of trouble. Now that the case is clear, the court held a public trial on the morning of the 7th, presided over by Chen Zhendgang, the chief of the Criminal Court. In order to prevent disorder, the court instructed the plaintiffs to send representatives, but the various creditors, concerned about their own interests, still crowded in, with more than a hundred people coming to listen at one time. The defendants Wang Jifei and his wife Wang Zhao, and the driver Liang Jiamao, all stood in front of the court in shackles, only the defendant Zhang Fengshi was not bound. After questioning the representatives of the creditors, the judge questioned the three main characters of the fraud one by one. Zhang Fengshi first confessed, "I don't owe anyone money. It's just that Wang Yifei and Zhao are trying to embezzle the 1 billion yuan and gold bars that I deposited in their family's fur business, which makes it impossible for me to cope. Now I want them to take the money out with a clear conscience." When Wang Yifei was questioned, Wang said, "What evidence do you have that your money was placed here with me? You are defrauding people and want to blame me." The other defendants, Wang Zhao and Liang Jiamao, also denied everything and refused to tell the truth. At this point, the judge turned to the creditors again, inquiring in detail about the process of Wang Yifei instructing his driver to transport the property. Finally, the prosecutor and the defendant's lawyer spoke in succession, and the debate was declared over until 2:00 PM, and the sentence was scheduled to be announced on the 12th.</p>

<h3>President Yu Returns to Nanjing from Shaanxi; Meets with Reporters to Discuss Impressions of Western Tour; Lasting Peace in Xinjiang Can Certainly be Realized</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] "This time, when I returned from the Northwest, the various ethnic groups in the Northwest entrusted me to say hello to everyone, they are also very well, and what they most hope is that everyone will work together to create a new China of the Three People's Principles." This was the first thing President Yu Youren said to a Central News Agency reporter after flying from Xi'an to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 7th. Yu continued to tell reporters at his official residence, "The various ethnic cultures in Xinjiang each have their own strengths. Because of the barriers of writing and language, it is often not easy for outsiders to understand. No matter where I went, the people were strong, lively, and enterprising, and very lovable." Yu spoke highly of Chairman Zhang's efforts to govern, saying: "The new provincial government is a democratic organization. People of all ethnic groups participated in it, and everyone was united and worked together to move forward. According to my observation, after the promulgation of the Xinjiang policy guidelines, everyone is working together, enduring hardship, and has begun to work on local affairs one by one. In the future, lasting peace in Xinjiang can certainly be realized." During this western tour, Yu's footprints spread throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains and was warmly welcomed and loved by people of all ethnic groups, which can be confirmed in his conversation.

Men and women in rural areas are dressed neatly and cleanly, and some places are even better than the interior."</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US Reiterates Policy on Germany</h3>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes traveled from Paris to Germany the day before yesterday, where he delivered a speech in Stuttgart, outlining the US policy on Germany. The main points were fivefold: (1) He advocated that Germany should immediately establish a temporary central government; (2) The US does not want to see Germany become a vassal of any major power or bloc, nor does it want to see the German people subjected to dictators again; (3) The British, American, French, and Soviet occupation zones should eliminate all barriers to ensure complete economic unification of Germany; (4) A German National Committee should be established under the control of the United Nations to handle national affairs and draft a constitution to form a permanent federal state of Germany; (5) The US opposes Germany ceding the Saar region to France and the Königsberg region to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Before departing for Germany, Byrnes met with French Foreign Minister Bidault to exchange views on the German issue and expressed his willingness to notify the French authorities of the draft speech in advance. This shows that Byrnes's speech was not only fully endorsed by Britain, but also received considerable understanding from France. However, the Slavic countries, especially the Soviet Union and Poland, are bound to express their objections, and may even believe that Byrnes's speech violates the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, which is also unknown. However, the Soviet Union must have known about Byrnes's trip to Berlin long ago. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, on his way back to Paris from Moscow, spent some time in Berlin and must have made arrangements to counteract the reaction caused by Byrnes's speech. Therefore, Byrnes's speech is not only related to the future destiny of Germany, but even the division and union of the entire Europe can be seen in this trip to Berlin.</p>
<p>Since Germany surrendered on May 9th last year, the European war can be considered over. How to deal with the aftermath of the war in Europe and how to control the defeated Nazi Germany, it is logical that the major powers should have discussed a concrete solution long ago, so that European countries can return to normal as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, when the three giants of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union met in Potsdam, because the war against Japan had not yet ended, everyone's energy was focused on the war against Japan, and they had no time to take care of the defeated Germany. Therefore, only a few methods were decided in principle. After Japan surrendered, the foreign ministers of the five countries met in London to discuss the European peace issue, but because of the differences in interests between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they broke up unhappily, and the European issue fell into a stalemate. Until now, the German issue is still like a mess, and there is no way to clean it up.</p>
<p>However, Germany has been occupied by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union for more than a year. During this year, Germany seems to have been dismembered by the major powers and split into four countries, not only politically unified, but also economically unified. The heavy burden of military expenses has overwhelmed the German people, and the artificial barriers have prevented the flow of materials. The general German people feel the difficulties of life and the vagueness of the new Germany. Even the British and American occupation authorities feel that the current situation, if not improved, will eventually make the purpose of occupying Germany—(1) eradicating the remaining evils of Nazism, (2) disarming Germany, (3) democratizing German politics, (4) preventing Germany from rising again to aggression and threatening world peace, etc.—impossible to achieve. The three countries of Britain, the United States, and France, therefore, all want to improve Germany's legal status. At the second Paris Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, the foreign ministers of Britain and the United States put forward the German issue for discussion, advocating the merger of the four occupation zones and the unification of economic institutions, but they were opposed by the Soviet foreign minister, and no agreement could be reached. Molotov only agreed to convene a conference of foreign ministers of the four countries again after the closing of the United Nations General Assembly in September to specifically discuss the German issue. However, it is not certain whether the United Nations General Assembly can be held as scheduled, and it is even more unknown when the German issue will be discussed after the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>Byrnes, with the qualifications of a first-class American diplomat, faces reality squarely and knows the difficulty of solving the German issue. He changed his approach, avoiding the important and focusing on the minor, starting with the merger of the economic institutions of the British and American occupation zones. The two sides immediately conducted negotiations and announced the agreement on the 5th of this month. Byrnes's speech in Germany this time, explaining the US policy on Germany, has a profound meaning. France will follow in the footsteps of Britain and join the economic institutions of the British and American occupation zones, which is unlikely to be a problem; the only problem is the Soviet Union. At that time, the confrontation between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe will become more exposed, and the division of Europe into "East" and "West" may become inevitable. At the same time, if the United Nations General Assembly is postponed, it is unknown when the German issue will be discussed!</p>
<p>In short, standing on the position of a third party, analyzing the speech delivered by Byrnes, we finally feel that the United States' attitude towards the defeated country can be called bright, generous, and benevolent, which is not to be blamed. Because what the United States needs is a reasonable and lasting peace, it opposes any measures based on "revenge." We only hope that those who want to impose revenge on the defeated country will reconsider the generosity of the United States.</p>
<p>Corrigendum</p>
<p>In yesterday's editorial "People-to-People Diplomacy between China and the United States," the character "共" in the fourteenth character of the second paragraph was mistakenly printed as "央". This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Prosper Taiwan: Chen Yi is Confident of Achieving the Goal</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of the United Press, Taipei, 6th] Taiwan fell into the hands of the Japanese for as long as fifty years, and now it has been returned to China. During the decades of Japanese occupation, Taiwan has developed considerably, but most of the factories were destroyed during the war, and the people's degree of Japanization is also very deep. Therefore, how the Chinese government will accept the wealth left by the Japanese and make the prosperous Taiwan prosper is a very important issue. Chen Yi, the Chief Executive of Taiwan, is confident that Taiwan can achieve this goal under his administration.</p>
<p>At a recent press conference, Chen said: The work of changing Taiwan from a Japanese colony to a province of China is quite slow and tortuous. And the island's restoration work is also difficult due to the severe air raids and other damages suffered during the war.</p>
<p>He said: Japan's policy in Taiwan was that the Japanese were superior to the local people in all aspects, and they occupied key positions in all aspects of life. Due to the repatriation of the Japanese, there is a serious lack of manpower, and there are no suitable people to replace these important positions.</p>
<p>According to Chief Executive Chen: In the forty-five days ending April 30, 1946, with the assistance of the US military, a total of 117,000 Japanese soldiers and 290,000 civilians were repatriated. To illustrate the lack of manpower caused by the repatriation work, Chen pointed out that among the 290,000 Japanese civilians who returned to their country, 7,000 were police officers and 11,600 were primary and secondary school teachers.</p>
<p>Chen also said: The plan of the Chief Executive's Office is to replace the Japanese with Taiwanese as much as possible. As for the more important positions, they must be held by civil servants from mainland China, because the Taiwanese are not competent enough. All the local people who are selected to replace the Japanese are given specialized training in advance.</p>
<p>In terms of materials, Taiwan is also in extreme shortage. Japan's economic policy in Taiwan has always been "Japan First" doctrine. For most of the period that Japan occupied the island, Taiwan has always been an agricultural unit in the entire plan of the Japanese Empire. Until before the outbreak of the Pacific War and during the war, the Japanese began to develop Taiwan industrially. As a result, Taiwan became completely dependent on Japan.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, Chen pointed out the following facts: He said that the Japanese encouraged Taiwanese to use chemical fertilizers, consuming as much as 500,000 tons each year, but the island did not produce any of these chemical fertilizers. Until shortly before the end of the war, a few small chemical fertilizer plants were built. In the first half of this year, Taiwan urgently needed 250,000 tons of fertilizer, but only 2,500 tons shipped by the United Nations were imported.</p>
<p>One of the main difficulties in restoring Taiwan's industry is that there are no new machines, parts, and tools to assemble into the factories built by the Japanese. Several factories that supplied this equipment have been bombed, and others have been shut down.</p>
<p>The lack of transportation constitutes another obstacle to the island's restoration. Japanese ships traveling to and from Taiwan's ports were requisitioned by the Japanese Navy during the war and sunk or damaged. There are no regular schedules for the available ships, and they are not designed to cope with large-scale trade. Only China Airlines operates a three-times-a-week flight route.</p>
<p>The island's highways and railways have been badly damaged due to wartime neglect and bombing. The authorities have encountered difficulties in importing motor vehicles. However, although railway vehicles are in short supply and bridges and tracks are damaged, trains still run on a regular schedule.</p>
<p>Another difficulty encountered in Taiwan's administration is the language barrier. Most Taiwanese migrated from Fujian and speak the so-called Southern Min language or Amoy dialect. When the Japanese controlled the island, they tried their best to promote Japanese spoken language and writing. As a result, Taiwanese lost their ability to use the national language.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Chen believes that in the summer of 1947, all school books in Taiwan will be in the national language. 70% to 80% of Taiwanese students have been able to use the national language after training in special language schools.</p>
<p>Taiwan's most famous Chinese newspapers still retain the Japanese version to facilitate readers, but it will be discontinued in late October, but some readers have requested that it be continued for some time.</p>
<p>At the press conference, Chief Executive Chen admitted that the salaries of most civil servants from mainland China are higher than those of local Taiwanese. He said: The living standards of civil servants from mainland China are higher than those of local Taiwanese, and they are far away from their hometowns, so their expenses are naturally greater. He denied that there was any discrimination against Taiwanese and declared that anyone with better qualifications should naturally be given higher salaries.</p>
<p>Chen stated that in view of the inflation on mainland China, the Taiwan dollar will continue to be used for some time. If a unified currency system is implemented at this time, the result will inevitably cause serious economic repercussions among the Taiwanese. The exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar was previously set at 20 legal tender dollars to 1 Taiwan dollar. The Taiwanese people requested the Executive Yuan to revise the exchange rate to 40 to 1, which is still pending a decision from Nanjing. At the same time, the exchange of Taiwan dollars with mainland China is temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Chen revealed that the real estate formerly owned by Japanese nationals or the Japanese government that has now been taken over by the provincial government will be leased directly to farmers as a form of assistance. It is reported that the authorities have drafted a plan to establish cooperatives to provide farmers with technical and economic assistance.</p>
<p>Chen also announced that Taiwanese people will have equal opportunities to participate in administrative institutions at all levels—including village councils elected by popular vote and provincial councils.</p>

<h3>Czech Republic and Poland Sign Treaty of Friendship, Negotiations Reach a Stalemate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 6th] The negotiations on the Czech-Polish Treaty of Friendship, which were conducted in the four capitals of Moscow, Prague, Paris, and Warsaw, have reached a stalemate. The two countries originally agreed not to raise the territorial issue when negotiating this treaty. However, according to the Czech side, Poland demands rights for people of Polish nationality in the Czech Republic, which is an obstacle to the negotiations. The Czech government believes that most of these Polish people are miners and workers in the border area, and they have the same rights as Czech citizens, and enjoy special convenience in written and agricultural affairs. If Poland's demands are accepted, it will greatly hinder the Czech Republic's post-war policy.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Senior State Department officials announced today that Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart, Germany, has placed the Soviet Union on the defensive diplomatically. This speech has set a long-term policy for the restoration of German autonomy, and is one of the most important declarations of US foreign policy.

<h3>US Maritime Strike Expands: Number of Strikers Reaches 500,000; Over 2,500 Ships on Both Coasts Halt Operations; Seamen from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden Decide to Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] The number of American maritime strikers has reached 500,000. More than 2,500 ships in the Atlantic, Pacific, and various gulfs have ceased operations. The strikers are determined to continue until the Wage Stabilization Board withdraws its reduction and increase of wages. The employers agreed to a wage increase of $22.50, but the Wage Stabilization Board ruled for $17.50, whereas the current average monthly wage is $145. A spokesperson for the US Maritime Commission stated: This is the most wasteful strike in American maritime history. Transoceanic passenger transport has completely stopped, and the import and export of important industrial raw materials have also been disrupted.</p>
<p>United Nations relief supplies destined for Europe and Asia are also stranded on 125 ships. UNRRA Director LaGuardia, returning from Europe, stated: He will appeal to the striking stevedores to continue loading relief supplies to countries in need. The strike will cause the food on cargo ships to spoil. Maritime authorities have appealed to the seamen's union to keep the refrigeration equipment on ships running to prevent food spoilage. The strike is affecting the national economy. The Pacific American Shipowners Association has appealed to Truman to immediately intervene to resolve the situation. The union has no disputes with the employers, only with the government agency, so the employers are powerless.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 6th] A spokesperson for the American Maritime Union recently announced: Seamen from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have decided to dispatch pickets to ports in their respective countries to support the American maritime strike.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Department of the Army announced: The seamen's strike has spread nationwide. Food and other supplies for American occupation forces in Europe and Japan are also being hampered. Supplies for the occupation forces in Japan are particularly at a standstill. The overseas troops currently have enough supplies for six months, so there is no immediate crisis.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] Leaders of the Seamen's Union reported today that striking seamen have set up a blockade line in the New York dock area, preventing 534 ships in the port from moving. Officials said that a total of 2,534 ships are being held up along the US coasts.</p>
<h3>British Warship Sails to Trieste</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bari, 7th] The British cruiser HMS "Ajax" departed from here today for Trieste.</p>
<h3>US Conducting Thorough Study of the Status of Pacific Islands</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] According to reliable sources: Officials here are deeply concerned about the future legal status of the Pacific islands. They are studying whether to occupy the islands entirely or partially, or to place them under the United Nations trusteeship. The US Army and Navy Departments believe that occupying these bases is essential for American security. These bases can be divided into three categories: (1) Pacific islands formerly mandated to Japan, namely the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands; (2) Territories formerly belonging to Japan, such as Okinawa; (3) Territories formerly under British rule and Australian trusteeship. The general consensus is as follows: For the first category, the US Army can decide the duration of occupation. For the second category, the US can seek to obtain trusteeship. For the third category, the US should also seek to obtain joint trusteeship. Some of these islands are strategically valuable and should be placed under military control; therefore, the issue is extremely complex.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Still Has Not Repatriated Captured Japanese Soldiers; Japan Sends Letter Requesting MacArthur's Assistance; US Declares to the Soviet Union It Is Prepared to Provide Ships for Repatriation at Any Time</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese government has sent a letter to MacArthur Headquarters requesting assistance in repatriating 100,000 Japanese soldiers captured by the Soviet army. A copy of the letter has been forwarded to the US State Department. It states: Japanese prisoners in the Northeast must be repatriated before this winter, otherwise, 100,000 of them will inevitably die, as the Japanese in the Northeast are experiencing a severe shortage of food, clothing, fuel, and medicine.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) The Soviet side of the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan expressed dissatisfaction with MacArthur Headquarters' refusal to provide ships for the evacuation of Japanese residents from the Soviet occupation zone. US representative Acheson replied today, stating: Soviet representative Telegin's unwillingness to discuss the repatriation of Japanese residents outside of North Korea and Eastern Manchuria is preventing a complete resolution of the issue, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Japanese combat personnel remaining in Soviet hands. Headquarters representatives have declared to Soviet representatives that Headquarters is fully prepared to provide sufficient ships to evacuate all Japanese residents and prisoners. Other countries have all fully agreed to the repatriation of Japanese residents and prisoners. With negotiations with Soviet representatives in Tokyo regarding the repatriation of Japanese residents and prisoners in the Soviet zone at a standstill, the US representative has reported the situation to Washington, and the US government will continue negotiations with the Soviet government. Approximately 800,000 Japanese soldiers captured by the Soviet Union in Eastern Manchuria and North Korea have not yet been repatriated.</p>
<h3>Nehru's First Broadcast Speech After Taking Office Expresses Concern About the Chinese Civil War</h3>

<h3>Northwest India Bombed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Peshawar, India, 6th] Known as the "Frontier Gandhi," the leader of the Northwest Frontier Province Congress Party, Ghaffar Khan, declared today: The tribal areas of Waziristan are also undergoing large-scale aerial bombardment. The reason for the strict secrecy is clear. On one hand, they extend a friendly hand to us and establish a national government in the center, while on the other hand, they create administrative difficulties for the central government. This is truly perplexing. Authorities in New Delhi stated: The bombing is to punish the natives in a part of Waziristan, and they were warned in advance to evacuate. Only two people were injured. The claim of a collective, large-scale bombardment is an overstatement.</p>
<p>Today's manuscript, the special correspondence "Going to Paris," will continue tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Supplementary Election of National Councilors in This City; Jin Zhenyu Has the Highest Popularity</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to central government regulations, National Councilors cannot concurrently serve as city councilors.

<h3>Investigation Team to Depart for Hangzhou Tomorrow; Less Than One-Tenth of the Cases Handled in Shanghai; Chen Yongqin Issues Two Statements Regarding the Accusations</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Investigation Team has been in Shanghai for about two months and has received many confidential reports of cases. It has decided to actively process them. However, according to Committee Member Zhang, the actual number of cases handled is less than one-tenth of the total. Now, Team Leader Zhang Zhiben, Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen, and Committee Member Wu Wangji are scheduled to depart for Hangzhou by express train at 4:40 PM tomorrow to investigate the situation of the takeover in that area. The Railway Bureau has specially provided a comfortable private car to comfort the investigation envoys.

Committee Member Zhang was not present, and Secretary Xu received him. Colonel Chen inquired about the name of the informant, but Secretary Xu refused. Thereupon, Colonel Chen issued two statements: (1) He is only a colonel, and higher-ranking personnel are responsible for all takeover work. He has no authority to alter any inventory list. (2) The car mentioned by the informant is not used by him alone, but is used by many people in the command.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of alleged corruption by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Property Management Office, Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen stated yesterday: (1) Whether the Xingye Cooperative has the right to bid on seized materials will be submitted to the central government for approval. (2) Whether the bidding procedures are legal is still under investigation. (3) Whether the bidding records match has been forwarded to the Shanghai office of the Auditing Department for review.</p>
<h3>Investigation Team Inspects China Textile Industries</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] After arriving in Shanghai, the Investigation Team received many confidential letters related to the China Textile Industries (中紡). Team Leader Zhang Zhiben, Committee Member Wu Wangji, and Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen believe that to thoroughly investigate whether there is corruption in the China Textile Industries takeover, focusing on individual details will not lead to any results. To thoroughly understand the inside story, it is necessary to investigate the entire takeover situation of the China Textile Industries. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, they went to the general office of the China Textile Industries to visit General Manager Shu. According to him, all China Textile Industries factories were transferred to them by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After the takeover, they actively reorganized the factories, which greatly contributed to stabilizing the prices of yarn and cloth on the market. The China Textile Industries takeover work can be summarized into three points: (1) The takeover work has been largely completed. A small number of factories have not yet been taken over due to disagreements with the processing bureau, so the inventory lists have not yet been completed. (2) A total of 3 million bolts of yarn and cloth have been taken over. 1.5 million bolts have been sorted out, 1 million bolts are still being sorted, and 500,000 bolts are awaiting inspection. (3) The China Textile Industries has slightly different opinions from the processing bureau regarding the return of some of the taken-over factories to their original owners.</p>
<p>The Investigation Team authorities believe that: (1) A list of taken-over factories and factories that have not yet been completely taken over should be prepared separately. (2) A table should be prepared and submitted regarding the bidding situation of the yarn and cloth. (3) A list should be prepared and submitted regarding the situation of the return of factories.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, Committee Members Wu and Zhang personally went to inspect the China Textile Industries' 19th Factory (formerly Gongda No. 1 Factory) and 17th Factory (formerly Yu Zong Factory). They were satisfied with the resumption of work. However, regarding whether there is corruption in the China Textile Industries takeover, Committee Member Zhang said that to thoroughly investigate, it would take at least a week to collect various types of files and inventory lists for detailed study to determine the situation.</p>

<h3>Tragedy Outside Wusong Mouth: American Giant Ship Collides With Small Boat; Four Survivors, Ten Drowned</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a tragic accident occurred near the No. 4 floating pier in Gaoqiao Port outside Wusong Mouth, resulting in a small boat capsizing and ten people drowning. The American Weilihan Company's giant ship "Saiweisha," which was sailing between Shanghai and the United States, was ordered to export the day before yesterday.

As a result, only four people, including Cao Shigen and Xu Zhigen, were fortunate enough to survive due to their swimming skills. The remaining ten people all drowned. It is learned that the giant ship that caused the accident continued to move forward after the incident and disappeared in an instant. The victimized Fuxing Company has reported the incident to the Jianghai Customs and the Water Police Bureau and is preparing to make serious representations to the Weilihan Company.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Who Attended Court During the Occupation Must Have Proof to Apply for Resumption of Practice</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Regarding the resumption of practice procedures for lawyers who attended the pseudo-courts during the occupation, the local court of this city received instructions from the High Court to handle the method of handling lawyer certificates issued by the pseudo-organizations in the August 13th Jing Xun Ren No. 4200 instruction from the Judicial Administration Department as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lawyer certificates issued by pseudo-organizations are invalid.

<h3>Room Tax Ticket Deliverers Are Not Responsible for Collecting Money</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Since the summer, the Shanghai Finance Bureau has been collecting room tax and has switched to using a five-part room tax payment form. Staff are dispatched to deliver the forms to households, who are required to take them to any payment location to pay the tax within the deadline. However, the bureau's deliverers are not responsible for collecting tax payments. If taxpayers entrust the tax payments to the deliverers for collection or transfer, the bureau will not be held responsible.</p>

<h3>The Changchun Prisoner of War Camp Was Like Hell on Earth: Testimony from Two Witnesses in the Case of Japanese War Criminals Inuitsuka and Kawashima Regarding the Deaths of Twenty-Four American Prisoners Killed in Bombings</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The testimonies of witnesses Harkins and Ganate regarding the case of Japanese war criminals Colonel Matsuda and Captain Kawashima, who abused American prisoners of war at the former Changchun prisoner of war camp, were heard yesterday morning. Harkins presented a photograph of the prisoner of war camp in court, pointing out that its location was only about 200 meters from a tram manufacturing factory. He had suggested building air raid shelters in the camp, but Matsuda refused. As a result, 24 American prisoners of war were killed in a bombing. Matsuda even forced the injured to write to the American command requesting that they stop bombing the area. However, the wounded American prisoners instead declared in the letter that they welcomed the US Air Force to continue bombing Changchun. The second witness, Ganate, was nearly blind, but he was still able to walk to the defendant's seat yesterday and, after carefully identifying Captain Kawashima, declared, "This is the captain!" Ganate went on to recount the circumstances at the time, saying that whenever he complained of an eye disease, Kawashima ignored him completely and refused to give him any medicine. On one occasion, he accused him of stealing alcohol and beat him with fists and feet and used water torture, so his head still feels unwell. The general conditions in the camp hospital at the time were even worse. After Kawashima left the camp every night, there were no medicines available, which caused many patients to become seriously ill and die.</p>

<h3>Tenant Commits Suicide, Landlord Moves the Body, Court Investigation Deems It Suspicious</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Xiyuan, a sub-landlord at No. 134 Tangfang Lane in the Nanshi area, sublet a room to Li Changfu (from Dongtai, over sixty years old), who lived alone. His son, Li Zirong, and his mother, Zhou, lived separately at No. 54 Jiangyin Street. Recently, Li Changfu suffered from illness. Medical treatment proved ineffective, and he harbored thoughts of ending his life. Around 4 AM the previous morning, he took a razor and slashed his throat, causing a cut about half an inch deep. He cried out in pain, which was heard downstairs. Chen Xiyuan, the sub-landlord, woke up from his deep sleep and went upstairs to investigate. He saw Li Changfu lying on the floor, already dead. Chen, feeling overwhelmed because of the death, carried the body out and hung it on a bamboo fence near Gaochangsi Temple, two or three houses away, with a rope around his neck. More than an hour later, a Zhou surname rickshaw puller went to the area to relieve himself and was horrified to see the body and shouted loudly. Neighbors gathered upon hearing the commotion. Someone who knew the deceased reported it to his son and notified the Penglai Police Station. Deputy Chiefs Yao Lu and Zheng ordered officers Wu Zhipeng, Wang Dianxiang, and Shan Zhendong to rush to the scene for investigation. The next morning, they requested the court to conduct an investigation, which deemed the suicide suspicious. The police station was instructed to reinvestigate. Chen Xiyuan, the suspect who moved the body, was taken to his residence, where the razor used for the suicide was found downstairs and presented as evidence. Chen explained the circumstances, and the case was submitted for judicial review.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Opens China-Philippines Route, Hai-Xia to Sail to Manila; Acquires Over One Hundred U.S. Ships in the Philippines</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since its resumption of business, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has expanded significantly with government assistance. The number of ships is more than three times that before the war, and the company is still continuously purchasing ships overseas. In May of this year, the company was instructed by the Executive Yuan to send Yan Zengfu to the Philippines to select and purchase U.S. surplus materials. After inspecting the Philippines for more than a month, Mr. Yan selected and purchased over a hundred ships of various sizes. Mr. Yan returned to Shanghai on the 6th and told reporters in the Bureau on the 7th about the situation in Nanyang and the dates the ships will arrive in Shanghai, saying: After the independence of the Philippines, the atmosphere is completely new, but because it was affected by the war, the fields are barren, and it is difficult to cultivate them for a while, which has greatly affected agricultural production. Therefore, materials are extremely scarce. At present, the most urgent needs are cotton products, electrical equipment, and porcelain. I sincerely hope that our country can transport and sell these goods. The Philippines produces a lot of wood, and many new sawmills have been established in the Philippines by Chinese. A considerable amount of wood has been transported to China. As for the purchase of American surplus ships, there are a total of 115 ships, including tugboats, iron barges, docks, cranes, and dredgers. Most of them are still under repair and will arrive in Shanghai one after another by the end of this year. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has assigned the Hai-Xia to operate the China-Philippines route. The Philippine side has entrusted China Development Company to act as its agent. The Filipino people welcome ships from our country. Philippine ships have already been traveling between Hong Kong and Xiamen and will soon come to Shanghai. It is known that there is little cargo transportation between Shanghai and the Philippines, because there are direct giant ships operated by American merchants, I am afraid that it cannot reach the ideal goal, so the Hai-Xia's route will mainly focus on various ports between Xiamen and the Philippines. Because most of the overseas Chinese are doing business between Xiamen and the Philippines. The ship has returned to Shanghai from Tianjin and may no longer sail north, it is preparing the formalities to sail to the Philippines.</p>
<h3>"Serving Society, Forging Oneself": Female Police Officers Are Not What They Used to Be - Young, Meticulous, and Rigorously Trained - Most Love Being Beautiful and Don't Like Wearing Uniforms</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] The term "female police officer" seems to carry a somewhat discriminatory gaze from the general public. The origin of this discrimination stems from unfamiliarity and lack of understanding of this profession. Driven by curiosity, our reporter conducted an on-the-spot investigation of female police officers and gained a clearer picture of their history and current situation.</p>
<p>Shanghai had female police officers long before the War of Resistance. At that time, Cai Jingjun, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, employed female police officers for the needs of searching female criminals and other tasks. These female police officers were different from the female police of the former Public Concession Police. Those female police officers, colloquially known as "female searchers," were mostly the wives or widows of police officers with extremely low levels of knowledge, and the public also looked down on them. They had no other tasks except standing at intersections and serving as searchers for women.</p>
<p>After the victory, the police bureau was determined to rectify and reform, and to alleviate the shortage of police officers and to meet the need for female police officers, it publicly recruited candidates. Applicants were required to have at least a junior high school education or equivalent academic ability. After being accepted, they had to undergo one month of training at the Yulin Road Police Training Center. All food and lodging expenses during the training period were provided by the government. Life in the center was very difficult, with everything being militarized, such as eating on the ground. At 5:45 AM every morning, everyone had to get up immediately when the horn sounded and finish washing up within fifteen minutes. At exactly 6:00 AM, everyone had to gather on the lawn for squad exercises. Half an hour later, the horn sounded again, and the flag-raising ceremony was held. All of these actions, including breakfast, had to be completed before 7:00 AM. Classes began at 7:00 AM, and the subjects studied were numerous, including violation of police regulations, criminal law abstracts, police ordinances, and police correspondence. In addition, handgun training and target practice were also included in the training. After one month, a graduation examination was held for three days. Those who passed were assigned to various departments and were required to remain employed for one year; otherwise, they would have to compensate the government for all losses incurred during the training period.</p>
<p>To date, there are over two hundred female police officers in Shanghai. They are all very young, averaging between fifteen and twenty-five years old. Most of them are assigned to internal affairs work, such as dance hall registration, household registration work, judicial interrogation records, and lost children care. Because women are generally more careful, their performance has been outstanding, and the public's perception has been renewed.</p>
<p>Their work assignments are subject to the orders of their superiors. Sometimes, they also have the opportunity to participate in external affairs work, such as catching "scroungers" on bridges and investigating "wild chickens" during the day. As a result, they have gained a deeper understanding of current society, especially the darker side of society.</p>
<p>Like all personnel in the police bureau, female police officers are required to wear uniforms. The summer uniform is a white shirt and black skirt. The winter uniform is exactly the same as the male police officers - long pants and cotton coats. They do not like to wear uniforms because they are all young, and young people always like to be beautiful.</p>
<p>Currently, their treatment is the same as that of first-class police officers, with a monthly salary of only 100,000 yuan. They inevitably complain about this meager salary, but this is an overall economic problem, and complaining alone is useless. Fortunately, they have no burdens, and they have a great interest in their daily work. They say: "Being a female police officer allows us to serve society on the one hand and forge ourselves on the other!"</p>

<h3>Many Chinese Students Have Lung Disease</h3>
<p>Dr. Kilmore also told the press</p>
<p>[News from the French News Agency in London, 6th] Dr. Kilmore, a joint lung tuberculosis expert, recently told the press here: If we cannot effectively control tuberculosis, millions of Chinese people will die of lung disease. Outside of one or two large cities in China, there is no facility for treating tuberculosis. Chinese students have a higher rate of tuberculosis than the general population, probably because universities recruit too many students. Dr. Kilmore arrived in London.</p>
<h3>The Last Group of Teachers, Students, and Staff From Great China University Leave Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Chongqing] Great China University began its relocation in May, with teachers, students, and staff returning to Shanghai from Chishui, Guizhou, in succession. The last group of over one hundred teachers, staff, and students, along with books, instruments, and other public property, departed from Chongqing by boat for Nanjing on the 5th. The school has sent people to Nanjing to receive them, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai in full around the 20th. The school's Zhongshan Road campus in Shanghai has been extensively repaired during the summer, and a auditorium has been added. Classes are scheduled to begin on September 23rd, with classes starting on the 30th.</p>
<h3>National Chongqing Normal School's Opening Date Uncertain</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Students Anxious and Worried</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Chongqing] The Ministry of Education decided before the summer to hand over Beibei National Chongqing Normal School to the provincial government. For several months, the provincial government has not sent anyone to take over. The original teachers have also returned east. Currently, the school is in a state of anarchy. Students who have not yet graduated see other schools starting classes one after another, while they themselves are at a loss. On the one hand, the mother school's opening date is uncertain, and on the other hand, even if they want to transfer to another school, the normal schools in Sichuan Province are full and will not accept them. They cannot serve in elementary schools because they do not meet the qualifications, which is also impossible. Hundreds of students are anxious day and night, with furrowed brows. Alumni of the school left in Chongqing have witnessed this and are heartbroken, and they are appealing to all parties to urge the government to pay attention and not let young people waste their studies, causing damage to the country's vitality.</p>
<h3>Serious Problem of Too Few Schools and Too Many Students: Minister Zhu and Wang Jing Report to the Chairman, Vice Minister Hang Flies to Guling on the 5th, Vice Minister Zhu Returns to Nanjing on the Same Day</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahao and Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong went to Guling to attend the Youth Corps Conference (the Minister of Zhu is a standing director, and the Deputy Minister is a supervisor), and because there is a lack of transportation for the return of inland schools, and in the capital and other places, because the school building has problems due to school recovery, and the serious problem of too few schools and too many students, they feel that the original plan to implement education at all levels cannot be implemented. Prices are soaring, affecting the predetermined budget, resulting in a huge shortage of educational expenses. They reported the various situations to Chairman Jiang and asked for relief. Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu also flew to Guling from Nanjing on the 5th because he was a member of the Youth Corps. Vice Minister Zhu returned to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 5th to handle departmental affairs. Our newspaper reporter visited Vice Minister Zhu on the 6th, and he said: How to solve the education matters after reporting to Chairman Jiang must wait until Minister Zhu returns to Nanjing to learn the details. Minister Zhu paid respects to the Chairman on the 5th, and must wait until after the Youth Corps Conference on the 8th, or even until the closing of the meeting to return to Nanjing, so the earliest is about the 10th or so. The main points of discussion of the Youth Corps, whether its function belongs to education or politics, and whether it belongs to the party's scope or outside the party's scope, are being studied and discussed and have not yet been decided. Minister asked Chairman Jiang about the matter of no school to accommodate them, and he will have to discuss the matter with President Song in person. In addition, various schools in the rear have not yet returned because the recent continuation of food requisition and transportation continues to affect them and it is difficult to proceed. The Ministry of Education has suggested that one or two ships be designated exclusively for school repatriation travel, but it is not known whether this hope can be achieved.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Ministry of Education is now petitioning the Executive Yuan to quickly order the agencies occupying school buildings to relocate so that schools can be reopened and students can avoid losing their studies. All schools this semester feel overcrowded and cannot be accommodated. According to Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong, the main reason is that many students from the Chongqing occupied area are admitted, plus the demobilization of the Youth Army, the distribution of the Lin University internship class, the enrollment of preparatory classes, the return of students from the rear, and the transfer of translators, etc., which has created a phenomenon of too few schools and too many students. The Ministry is planning to remedy the situation in many ways.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jianbai Gave a Lecture Yesterday: The Topic Was Viewing Politics from Education</h3>

<h3>Wireless Radio Printing Newspapers and Books</h3>
<p>Americans Invented After Ten Years of Research</p>
<p>[News from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, 7th] News from the China Society of Natural Sciences: After ten years of research and experimentation, Americans can now use wireless radio to print newspapers or photos, which is fast and convenient for reporting news and may supplement the shortage of newspapers in the future.

<h3>Yarn Merchants Still Tend Towards Spot Goods, Distribution of Yarn Focuses on Industrial Sector, Textile Construction Office's Industrial Survey Serves as Basis, Yarn Number Applicants Yesterday All Had Orders Returned</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became even more stable. Demand from the Changjiang gang turned strong, with healthy appetites. Regardless of whether the yarn count was from large factories or small ones, prices uniformly rose by 30,000 to 40,000. The Special Double Horse closing price also rose to 1.57 million. Confidence was strong, with everyone embracing the spot goods doctrine. They were not interested in the 400-pound standard yarn counts allocated by major yarn factories. Those in the industry who had been approved for allocation felt greatly troubled. This type of warehouse receipt would take at least ten days to convert into spot goods. Lanfeng and Riguang of the Textile Construction Office remained at 1.35 to 1.36 million. The market believed that the export of Cengwei cloth would soon be opened, so confidence was unanimously rising. Furthermore, yesterday when the Textile Construction Office opened yarn supplies, it allocated 20 counts to factories such as underwear knitting, and 32 counts to dyeing and weaving factories. All yarn number applicants had their orders returned. From this, it can be seen that the Textile Construction Office's plan to first allocate goods to production industries has already begun to be implemented.</p>
<p>It is heard that in order to understand the actual production situation of various registered manufacturers, the company has begun to conduct industrial surveys, starting with the machine dyeing and weaving industry and the knitting industry, and then extending to industries such as underwear, handkerchiefs, canvas, and electrical weaving. Statistics will be compiled in the future to serve as a reference for supporting overall production. The survey items include factory name, factory address, registration number with the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Bureau of Social Affairs, Textile Construction Office registration number, organizational nature, registered trademark, number of workers, wages, factory building, business operations, product sales, raw material requirements, production quantity, current raw materials, machinery equipment, and operating conditions. According to Specialist Shi Xinquan of the company, as of the end of August, over 4,000 manufacturers had applied to the company for registration to purchase allocated goods. Among them, in addition to yarn number and cloth number industries, the machine dyeing and weaving industry has the most production industries, followed by the knitting industry and the electrical weaving industry, while the underwear, handkerchief, and canvas industries are fewer. In the future, based on the survey results, the company will determine how to organize and classify them according to actual production and equipment conditions, and analyze them separately. If necessary, it will cooperate with the Bureau of Social Affairs to promote an industrial census. However, this survey is limited to registered manufacturers. If there are any registered manufacturers who have not received the survey form, they can directly collect it from the survey section of the company's business department.</p>
<p>Embargo on Hua Nan Already Officially Ordered</p>
<p>It is learned that the Customs has formally received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday, banning the export of cotton yarn to Guangdong and Fujian. Furthermore, according to officials of the Textile Construction Company, recent orders for cotton yarn from the Guangdong gang have sharply decreased.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] It is heard that the Executive Yuan has recently decided to ban the transport of cotton yarn and cloth to Guangdong and Fujian to prevent smuggling to Southeast Asia and to stimulate domestic cloth prices. At the same time, it has been decided that if there is a shortage of cloth in various parts of Hua Nan, the government will be responsible for the supply, with legitimate manufacturers as the allocation targets. It is also heard that this measure is temporary in nature, and will be considered for cancellation once the domestic supply of cloth is abundant.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest from Banks, Bond Market Pulled Up Again</h3>
<p>Although residual liquidation of public bonds has not stopped, buying interest from banks has not slackened. The supply on the market has gradually become exhausted. In addition, short covering was initiated, and the situation turned positive. Unified C opened in the morning at 1,820 yuan and was immediately oversubscribed, gradually rising to 2,360 yuan before some high-level selling caused a slight pullback. As a result, it closed up 500 yuan compared to the previous close. A and B rose 280 yuan, D rose 300 yuan, and Unified E also improved by 450 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Auction Scheduled, Chinese Stocks Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks shifted from stable to firm. Yongsha and Shengkai opened and saw 645 yuan, Meiya 3,950 yuan, Jingfu 2,450 yuan, Xinguang 2,75 yuan, and Qinxing 190 yuan. Later, because unpopular small and medium-sized stocks only advanced and did not retreat, coupled with the resumption of securities trading within the day, buyers were not affected and gradually improved. Around noon, they all saw high prices, with a slight pullback near closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by half to one tenth, and the less popular small and medium-sized stocks also improved by half to one tenth. Veteran stocks also made progress, and the over-the-counter market continued to rise after closing.</p>
<p>The situation for foreign stocks remained the same as the previous day. Chinese merchants continued to cut losses, while foreign merchants rushed to purchase, gradually stabilizing. However, after reaching high levels, the market consolidated. Yisha once rose to the 10,000 yuan mark, and British Union rose to 11,700 yuan, but fell to 11,300 yuan, finally stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha Paper, Yisha Beer, and Steel slightly rose, British Union Asia improved by half a tenth, and Huidemen and Guangping were flat.</p>

<h3>Money Market Generally Looser, Gold and Currency Both Seen with Good Profits, Banks and Shops to Adjust Business Hours Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Banking, Money, and Trust Industry Associations jointly issued an announcement yesterday, stating that the daily business hours for September have been set and announced. Now, in order to facilitate daily settlements for customers, it has been jointly resolved that, starting from September 9th, the business hours will be the same as those of the Nanjing banking industry association, and the previously announced business hours will be adjusted as follows: Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM (no interruption for lunch), Saturday 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Because the money market was generally looser yesterday, there were more compensators, suddenly turning profitable. Opening in the morning at 2.069 million, it gradually improved from 2.068 million. However, there was still a lack of special changes at first, so after 10 AM, the Central Bank still allocated 48 bars at a price of 2.0725 million. Afterwards, the US dollar turned firm, boosting sentiment considerably, and repeatedly raised prices. Although the Central Bank had supply, the attitude of raising prices resurfaced, so confidence became even firmer. At noon, it broke through the 2.1 million mark, seeing highs of 2.12 million. In the afternoon, because there were no special changes on Saturday, it finally closed up 47,000 compared to the previous close. The exchange rate with the US dollar narrowed to 613 yuan per tael. Decorated gold was 22,500, and silver ingots and silver dollars were flat. The dark interest rate was around 1.5 jiao, and outside the market, it still required 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies, due to rumors of a reduction and long non-convertibility, suddenly saw rumors of profit-taking yesterday, and buying interest was exceptionally strong, repeatedly rising. Starting from around 3,310 yuan in the early morning, it was immediately surrounded by buyers, gradually becoming stable, then firm, then even firmer. Around noon, it had already broken through the 3,400 yuan mark, approaching 3,430 yuan at noon. It slightly advanced in the afternoon, and finally closed up 120 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong tickets were initially weak but then firm, and also rose by 15 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 152 yuan due to urgent demand from the Guangdong gang for Shanghai electricity. On the market, it fell to below 670 yuan, and finally closed at 680 yuan to 690 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 820 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan with demand. The US exchange rate was around the listed price.</p>
<h3>Guangda Huahang Arrives with Large Batch of Soviet Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A large quantity of Russian paper has arrived in Shanghai again. The Enzhili (transliteration) number, managed by the Shunheng Foreign Firm, arrived at the port the day before yesterday, shipped from the port of Uglich, with over 3,250 tons of newspaper, drawing paper, and wood paper, totaling 14,115 pieces. It is currently being unloaded at pontoons number 24 and 25. The Russian paper was purchased and transported exclusively by Guangda Huahang.</p>
<h3>China Sand White Rises by 10,000 Yuan</h3>

<h3>Rayon Allocation Too Small, Black Market Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rayon, because the Textile Construction Office allocated it to silk weaving factories every other day, was limited, with each factory receiving only one box, or even just half a box, causing the black market to rise. 120 Bridge with light, Sheng called 600,000 yuan, then rose 50,000 yuan, and in a blink of an eye it rose to 700,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it called for an even higher 50,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of 120 with light were around 700,000 yuan, a large increase of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss and 150 with light saw an even greater increase, more than 200,000 yuan higher than the day before. However, because the price increase was too high, buyers held back, and there were few transactions. Although factory managers had transactions, the prices remained unchanged. Silk goods, Meiya bed covers, called for 800,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. The formal price was approximately a maximum of 800,000 yuan. All other goods were showing firmness. Transactions in flourishing goods were rarer, and the opening prices increased by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Smoke, White Coal are Firm and Active, Incoming Volume is Low, Quota Sufficient</h3>
<p>The arrival of white coal chunks in the coal market is still limited because exports from Tianjin still need to be approved by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee. Although transactions in white coal chunks are also quiet, the owners are keeping the spot goods, so white coal chunks have been firm in recent days. Due to the fuel committee's allocation limit to coal merchants and the United Business Office of Coal, the amount allocated for the first half of this month will be sufficient, so the United Business Office has also said that it will temporarily suspend allocation, and the market is becoming more active.</p>
<h3>Recent Buying Price of Japanese Silk: Lowest 5.55 Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to the US government agency Construction Finance Corporation, the prices paid by merchants who recently purchased 2,260 bales of Japanese raw silk were a minimum of $5.55 per pound and a maximum of $16 per pound.</p>
<h3>Household Sugar to be Implemented on Schedule, Company Decides to Distribute as Much as Possible to Eliminate Black Market, Those Who Have Applied in Other Locations Will Still Be Distributed Some</h3>
<p>Since the distribution method of sugar in this city was improved, the rising trend has been suppressed, and it has turned downward. According to the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, the sugar market can become stable. The company's supply is constantly arriving. If sugar prices fluctuate again, the company can directly sell, regardless of any sacrifice, to achieve the purpose of leveling prices. In the future, the company's distribution will target members of the Sugar Merchants Association. Both local and foreign locations will be wholesale by sugar merchants, and members of the South Goods industry will be specifically responsible for handling the task of affordable sugar. As for sugar sales by household, it will be implemented starting from the 13th period. The 12th period will close for registration on the 7th, and the 13th period will start registering from next Saturday, that is, handling the distribution of sugar purchases, implementing the purchase of sugar with certificates. The previous plan was to allow each person to purchase sugar twice a month with certificates, half a catty each time, but it has now been decided to change it to once, one catty each time. The quantity of sugar sold by retail stores will be based on the sugar purchase certificates received as the basis for verification. With the implementation of this method, citizens can indeed benefit practically, and retailers cannot easily transfer it to the black market in order to seek profiteering.</p>
<h3>Applications from Other Locations Transferred to Taiwan Sugar for Discretionary Distribution</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously believed that the difference between the approved distribution price of sugar and the black market price of sugar was too large, resulting in very large malpractices. It convened the Sugar Price Review Committee to re-deliberate the price, calculating China Sand at 140,000 yuan and Raw Sand at 130,000 yuan. Because the price of sugar has already changed, all applications for sugar distribution from the Sugar Industry Association of this port and other locations have become invalid and should be re-applied. This was passed by the meeting and recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that sugar merchants from other locations, such as Ning Zichun, suffered losses due to the change in methods, and applied to the Bureau of Social Affairs to withdraw the order. The bureau, considering that the claims were factual, agreed to request the Taiwan Sugar Company for review. The original application and attachments for the distribution of Taiwan Sugar for the 12th period from sugar merchants and cooperatives in other locations were transferred to the company for processing. Regarding the sugar price, it should still be paid according to the agreed price.</p>
<h3>Tallow Oil Prices Rise Unstoppably, Hankou Goods Are of Little Help, Eastern Zhejiang Stocks Are Mostly Gone</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tallow oil, because it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and candles are in high demand, and because of the hot weather, it is inconvenient to transport, and the source has decreased, the selling price is gradually increasing. Various companies have almost no goods to meet the market demand. There are not many stocks in the production area of Eastern Zhejiang, so the goods arriving in Hangzhou are dilapidated. Only the goods from Jingzhou Macheng and other places in Hankou are still arriving in succession, but it takes a lot of time to transfer them to Shanghai. The so-called distant water cannot quench a nearby fire. Although various companies in this port have managed to obtain some, not many have arrived, and the selling prices have gradually increased. Hebei Tallow is 150,000 yuan, Neiping is 140,000 yuan, Du Chui is 136,000 yuan, Longjian is 132,000 yuan, De Gan oil is 128,000 yuan, and Macheng oil is 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Export Tax Was Indeed Abolished Yesterday, Yang, Assistant to the Customs Chief, Reiterates</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The news that this city will be exempt from export tax starting yesterday was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The reporter visited Yang, assistant to the export supervisor of the Jianghai Customs, again yesterday. He said that the Jianghai Customs had indeed received instructions from the Inspector General of Customs yesterday, ordering the immediate exemption of export tax. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, the Jianghai Customs will no longer collect export tax at all.</p>
<h3>Simultaneous Promotion of Domestic and Foreign Sales, Tea Prices Continue to Show Good Color</h3>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, tea shops in this street see frequent increases in door-to-door sales, so demand has not decreased. At the same time, collection in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas is also very keen. As for the foreign firm tea market, export firms are still rushing to catch shipping schedules, and inquiries are exceptionally good. Therefore, transactions are exceptionally exciting under the buying enthusiasm. Selling prices continue to show good color, and small-leaf black tea still has a trend of being sold as soon as it is seen. In addition, new Bai Lin black tea is also favored by many. According to industry insiders, Qianlai Leaf Tea Company is willing to accept all new Bai Lin black tea that comes to them. However, it is heard that production of this type of flower has already stopped in the production area, so the stock is decreasing day by day. Looking ahead, there is still hope for repeated high prices.</p>
<h3>Rise in Chinese Medicine Slightly</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the large purchases from Taiwan and Guangdong, the trend of Chinese medicine has been towards high prices. Now, because the buying appetite has waned and funds are tight at the edge of the festival, all parties are taking a wait-and-see approach, so the rising trend has subsided, and transactions are also quiet.</p>
<h3>Liu An and Teak Soar</h3>
<p>In the timber market, in recent days, foreign pine and fir have been unable to rise because the source continues to arrive. Finishing materials such as Liu An and Teak have not arrived for a long time, and the stock is getting thinner, so sellers are hoarding, and prices are rising sharply. Liu An plywood prices are also active.</p>
<h3>Grain Review Committee Raises Rice Prices, Oil Market Digests Actively and Market Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market saw very keen sales from the store side, and the review price was also slightly increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The market trend was still stable with supply and demand. Indica and Japonica both rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, but the closing price was soft, forming a state of early firmness and late slackness. New Yin Yuan has slightly arrived, and the price is fair and stable. Chen Bai Yuan also followed suit and turned less. The supply and demand of flour were both balanced. The 17th rice price review meeting decided that the rice price would change slightly, calculating the price of white Japonica rice at 60,000 yuan, and the door sale price at 65,500 yuan, an increase of over 3% compared to before. Foreign Indica, community Indica, were 54,000 yuan, and the door sale price was 59,000 yuan, the same as before. Bu Yi Indica was 47,000 yuan, and the door sale price was 51,500 yuan, unchanged. Milled Indica was 43,000 yuan, and the door sale price was 47,000 yuan, an increase of over 2%. White Indica was 39,600 yuan, and the door sale price was 43,000, a decrease of slightly less than 5% compared to before. The sales of Saigon rice were weak, and the selling price remained at 43,000 yuan. The buying appetite for wheat in Fujian and Ningbo was strong, and the arrival of goods was scarce, so sellers were firm, and the price rose by 600 to 700 yuan. The sale of Northern white wheat was not smooth, and there were not many transactions, but it was pulled up by yellow wheat by 300 to 500 yuan. The buying appetite of soybean oil merchants was better, and the tired surface rejuvenated, rising by more than 100 yuan in the interval. Although the source of broad beans was not as prosperous as the previous one, the digestion was not strong, and it still fell by 300 to 500 yuan. There were slight inquiries about corn in Qingdao, and the decline stopped and rose, adding 1,000 yuan. The oil market was flourishing and active, with arrivals not matching digestion. Raw oil and soybean oil both added 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and tea oil also rose by 1,000 yuan. Clear oil appetite was dull and flat. Soybean cake still tended to move downstream.</p>

<h3>Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>— Wu Kuo-cheng</p>
<p>Our city is one of the world's six largest metropolises, yet its traffic situation is far from comparable to that of other cities. This is because in the past, the city's administrative bodies did not coordinate with each other, and the concessions, in particular, had no pre-planned arrangements, allowing everything to develop naturally. As a result, the city's road system is unclear, the widths are uneven, and to this day, it cannot meet the actual needs of vehicular traffic. Moreover, having suffered extreme devastation from the enemy and puppet regimes during the war, there is an unusual shortage of public transportation, forcing citizens to rely on tricycles and rickshaws as their means of transportation. The size of a tricycle is almost equivalent to two rickshaws, and their number has now reached over 15,000, which was unheard of before the war. Furthermore, most of the areas of southern Shanghai and Zhabei were destroyed in the war, and commercial and industrial activities have shifted towards the central district, leading to a concentration of all kinds of vehicles. All of these factors are the main reasons for the particularly congested traffic in the central district today.</p>
<p>The municipal government has already decided on measures to improve traffic order in the central district, which will be implemented starting tomorrow. The main points are to facilitate traffic flow and to impose restrictions; that is, based on traffic needs and road widths, to designate two lanes each for one-way traffic, and to specify the roads and times for different types of vehicles to pass or be prohibited from passing. Because the city's vehicles range from single-wheeled carts and two-wheeled rickshaws to three-wheeled bicycles and ten-wheeled trucks, the variety is extremely diverse. With countless vehicles of different sizes, speeds, and types competing for the same roads, it is no wonder that good traffic order cannot be maintained. Therefore, by implementing one-way traffic and lane separation methods, facilitating traffic flow, and imposing restrictions, it is hoped to improve the situation and achieve the goals of "order first" and "safety first."</p>
<p>The success of any undertaking depends on the close cooperation between the government and the people. If the government has no measures, the blame lies with the government; if the government has established measures, but the people do not actively assist and jointly implement them, the blame lies with the people. Regarding the city's traffic problem, public opinion often regards the ability to improve it as a litmus test for the municipal government. It is the duty of the municipal government to do its utmost. Now that measures to improve traffic in the central district have been formulated and implemented based on the actual situation, the extent to which citizens can comply with them will also serve as a litmus test for their cooperation. It is hoped that all vehicle drivers and all citizens will understand this and assist in the implementation, so that the city's traffic order can be on par with that of major cities around the world. This is my sincere hope.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from the Shanghai Municipal Automotive Management Regulations on Driving and Parking</h3>
<p>Article 35: When driving, one should pay attention to all traffic signs and obey the directions of traffic police.</p>

<h3>Scripts and Audiences</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>It is ideal for a script to be well-received by the audience when it is performed on stage. However, many scripts do not achieve this ideal outcome. This is not the fault of the audience, nor is it the fault of the scriptwriter. The reason is that different levels of knowledge result in different targets and different preferences.</p>
<p>I remember when Tolstoy's famous work, "The Power of Darkness," was performed at the Drama Academy, I heard different reactions from the audience.</p>
<p>The play is about a young peasant who is driven by dark forces to commit two wrongdoings: one is having an illegitimate child with his master's daughter, and before her family finds out, the young peasant buries the illegitimate child alive. The other is that he engages in ambiguous behavior with his master's young wife, which results in the master being angered to death. He eventually becomes the head of the family. That's roughly the story, but the "power of darkness" contained in the script can be felt at any time and any place. The playwright's purpose in writing this script was to tell the audience that all the sins were not the sins of the young peasant himself, but the sins of this "power of darkness." So, what exactly is this "power of darkness"? It is not explicitly stated in the script, but rather left for the audience to experience and feel for themselves.</p>
<p>Tolstoy has a pair of sharp eyes and a sharp pen. He saw the power that others could not see and wrote it down. This is something that is beneficial to young men and women. He calls on young men and women not to be shrouded by this "power of darkness." He tells them: This is a sinful thing. But how many people can accept this great revelation?</p>
<p>When this play was performed at the Jiang'an Drama Academy in Sichuan, the different reactions I heard were:</p>
<p>A middle school student said: This is really an unpleasant thing!</p>
<p>A wounded soldier said: This kid is so comfortable!</p>
<p>A gentleman-like person said: Are these even considered human beings?</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman kept exclaiming: Sinful, sinful!</p>
<p>From the mouths of these people, we know that they have accepted different things from the play. They cannot necessarily accept what the playwright wants to give. This is, of course, a necessary phenomenon at different levels of knowledge!</p>
<p>We certainly know that the audience in the stadium is entirely made up of sports fans, and people who don't like sports won't go to the stadium. People who go to dance halls must be interested in dancing, and those who are not interested will lose their enthusiasm after going once or twice. But the theater is different: people from all social strata can go to the theater to watch a play with an attitude of entertainment, using their own levels of knowledge to measure everything in the play, and using their own preferences and interests to accept the things in the play. This is the freedom of the audience, and playwrights cannot restrict them or force them to accept certain parts of the play. However, a playwright can identify the target audience for his work before writing the play, which may allow all audience members to gain a common understanding of what the playwright wants to convey.</p>
<p>Audiences in the theater have long been divided into three categories: one is the philosopher with a calm mind who seeks the truth in the play with reason. One is the easily moved old lady. The other is the young man who comes with an attitude of entertainment and cheers at random. These three types of people encompass all the audience members in the theater. If a play's performance can be liked by all three types of people, then it is a successful script.</p>
<p>The recent drama performances in Shanghai, without considering the artistic level for the time being, are always losing money in terms of business. The poor business is due to the small number of audience members; the small number of audience members also means that the play cannot be accepted by the audience. This proves that the performance of the play can only satisfy a certain class or a certain type of audience. Other audience members do not feel satisfied, so they do not enter the theater, which affects the theater company's losses, leading to the dissolution of the theater company!</p>
<p>In the past half year, summarizing the achievements and results of each performance, we can roughly know that the Shanghai audience likes extreme stimulation: they are more likely to accept sentimental dramas that make them cry or comedies that make them laugh at any time. They may not like scripts that fall between the two extremes and are neither crying nor laughing. Especially things that are high-level, serious, and truly works of art. Of course, this does not mean that the entire audience cannot accept them, but rather that only people with a high level of knowledge can accept them, that is to say, only one of the three types of audience members in the theater can accept this kind of true work of art.</p>
<p>For example, "The Return of Spring to the Earth" performed by the China Electric Theater Troupe and "Spring Cold" performed recently by the Shanghai Experimental Theater Society are both works of art that exceed the standard, but they both lost money. This surprised us theater workers. Why did such good dramas suffer such a tragic fate? This illustrates the interests and preferences of the majority of the Shanghai audience. At the same time, it tells the theater company负责人 that when selecting scripts to perform, if you are not prepared to lose money, you must clearly understand his target audience!</p>
<h3>"Desert Love Song" and "Hollywood Canteen"</h3>
<p>— Xin Wu</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has produced a grand war-effort film, "Hollywood Canteen," featuring female stars such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Joan Leslie, Barbara Stanwyck, Ida Lupino, and the Andrews Sisters. The male stars include Dennis Morgan, Eddie Cantor, Joe E. Brown, Jack Benny, Paul Henreid, and John Garfield, as well as the famous Vaughn Monroe Orchestra. This astounding lineup is unprecedented and breathtaking. The film is over two hours long. Warner Bros. has always been praised by audiences for its conscientious film production and avoidance of shoddy work, such as the literary films "Casablanca" and "The Watch on the Rhine," and the war film "Objective, Burma!", each of which has satisfied us.</p>
<p>"Hollywood Canteen" was shown at the Golden Gate Theater yesterday morning to entertain new figures in the community. Today, "Desert Song," a Technicolor film, will be shown at the Cathay Theater at 10:00 AM to entertain figures in the news and culture circles. The film was selected by Warner Bros. to celebrate the 20th anniversary of talking films.</p>
<h3>Tales of Nightingale Flying in the World</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>A rainy night, the theater was packed. On the music stage, Russ conducted the orchestra, and Nightingale sang on stage. But outside the theater door, a young man with a violin stared at the huge ticket prices plastered on the poster.</p>
<p>Nightingale, she is now a highly acclaimed singer. Many gentlemen and celebrities want to win her favor, but she detests these people and always tries to avoid them. That evening, she came out of the theater and happened to meet Ren Yun, a poor young musician. Ren Yun went to Nightingale's home and asked her to sing a song for him, Nightingale agreed.</p>
<p>At Ren Yun's home, he and a large group of workers were about to begin playing music. He publicly announced that Nightingale had sung for him, but no one believed him. As a result, Ren Yun's old friend Liu Qi suggested that he invite Nightingale to participate in the big program on Saturday night, Ren Yun agreed. Thereupon, the performance began.</p>
<p>Russ was Nightingale's teacher, an outdated old musician. He opposed Nightingale's association with the unknown Ren Yun, but Nightingale did not think so.</p>
<p>Ren Yun wrote a letter to Nightingale, inviting her to participate in their concert on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Saturday arrived, Ren Yun and Liu Qi were busy tidying up the house. Nightingale also rushed from the theater, everyone sang and played happily, the audience listened attentively. After a song was finished, it was greatly welcomed by the audience. Nightingale thanked them and bid farewell to go home. Ren Yun accompanied her on the road. Nightingale expressed her wish: she hoped to use her singing to give spiritual love to the public, she wanted to sing to everyone, to the broad masses. Ren Yun also believed that art should be for the masses, not the exclusive property of a few people. Nor should it be treated as a commodity for sale!</p>
<p>Nightingale returned home, Russ rebuked her and told her to break off contact with Ren Yun.</p>
<p>The next day, Nightingale had a dispute with Russ over the fact that ticket prices would be raised again next month. Nightingale said, "My singing is art, art that the public needs, not a commodity!"</p>
<p>Ren Yun and Liu Qi planned to organize an orchestra to perform in many places without music. They wanted to invite Nightingale to join. So, Ren Yun went to Nightingale's house to propose this idea to her. Unexpectedly, Russ bumped into him and scolded Ren Yun out!</p>
<p>One day, Liu Qi brought a radio home, and many neighborhood children came to listen. Lily, who lived downstairs, also squeezed in, but accidentally, she was squeezed out of the crowd and rolled downstairs. Lily was sent to the hospital, and Nightingale paid all the medical expenses. In addition, she gave Ren Yun 500,000 yuan as funding for organizing the orchestra, and promised to participate in their concert.</p>
<p>Nightingale joined the orchestra organized by Ren Yun, using the name Yang Yun, and followed the orchestra to perform in various working-class areas, which was very popular!</p>
<p>The next day, a news item was published in the newspaper: "Ms. Yang Yun comforts the common people." Russ saw it and strongly opposed it in front of Nightingale, he said: "If Yang Yun is my student, I will never allow her to do this!"</p>
<p>Russ, in order to sever the relationship between Ren Yun and Nightingale, personally went to Ren Yun's house and told Ren Yun about his relationship with Nightingale, asking Ren Yun to stop approaching Nightingale. But Ren Yun said: "Miss Nightingale is an adult, she has her own will, does Mr. Russ have any way to control her ideas?" Russ had nothing to say and went home in dismay. He proposed to Nightingale, Nightingale never expected that her teacher would propose to her. She was a little at a loss and said emotionally, "I will never leave you!"</p>
<p>The notice at the entrance of the theater read "Internal repairs, performances temporarily suspended." Ren Yun came out of it dejectedly. Later, Liu Qi learned from Nightingale's servant that Nightingale and Russ had gone to the countryside. Ren Yun recklessly went to the countryside to find her.</p>
<p>In the countryside, Ren Yun found Nightingale. The two reunited after a long separation, and their affection grew even stronger. They agreed to perform once again before New Year's Day. Nightingale decided to find a way to rush back to Shanghai before New Year's Day.</p>
<p>New Year's Day, in a large open square. This concert was performed again. Nightingale participated in the singing. Coincidentally, Feng Menghua, the chief writer of a tabloid, passed by. As a result, this new discovery was published in the newspaper with a large headline: "Yang Yun is Nightingale." Once the news spread, the number of audience members in Nightingale's theater decreased. Because those gentlemen thought that Nightingale's songs could be heard for free, what was so special about them? Nightingale told Russ her theme, she said: "Music is something that the public loves, a food that everyone needs, why can't it be enjoyed by everyone like sunshine and water? Those gentlemen only have money in their eyes, they use money to evaluate everything, what art do they understand, they are simply insulting art!" But Russ, after listening to her words, was not only unmoved, but instead drove her out. Nightingale went to Ren Yun. Ren Yun encouraged her and told her not to be afraid of anything and to go for it!</p>
<p>After that, Nightingale declared to the people that she would wander around to promote her aspirations! The love between Ren Yun and her grew day by day, and they finally got married. But they still sang and performed everywhere, whether in orphanages or nursing homes, there were their footprints.</p>
<p>Days passed, and the love they gave to people grew wider and wider. Everywhere people welcomed them, commemorated them, they were the true artists!</p>
<h3>Ouyang Fei Ying in "Nightingale Flying in the World"</h3>
<h3>Weekly Movie Review</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>This week, the best-selling movie is "Bathing Beauty". Although it has been released twice, it is still very popular. However, the domestic film "Zhong Yi Zhi Jia" (Family of Loyalty and Righteousness) is not weaker than the former.</p>
<p>Zhong Yi Zhi Jia (Family of Loyalty and Righteousness)</p>
<p>In the play, after the victory, amid Liu Qiong's eloquent remarks, shadows of various scenes move away one after another, which seems better than the ending.</p>
<p>Bathing Beauty</p>
<p>In terms of the overall technique and structure, this film is considered successful. If we use this analytical view; "watching the colorful scenes, Red Skelton's slapstick, and Esther Williams' swimming," then this film is an excellent film. The music is excellently matched, better than the formal performances in the film.</p>
<p>Minor irrationalities are allowed in comedies, but the film first describes how difficult it is for men to enter a women's school, but later, men inexplicably climb into Red Skelton's bedroom through the windows one after another, which is self-contradictory.</p>
<p>Bambi</p>
<p>Walt Disney's cartoon is unique. It does not have bright colors, and tries to be as close to nature as possible; the rain scenes and snow scenes are very well drawn, and the music accompaniment is even better than that of "Bathing Beauty".</p>
<p>If the ending could be changed to Bambi gradually aging, that would be better than the current succession to the position of stag king, and it is not necessary to change the picture.</p>
<p>Destination Tokyo</p>
<p>Cary Grant is calm and powerful. The underwater bomb section is the most exciting, and the appendectomy section. It seems isolated; if it is said to be a symbol of removing obstacles, it is better to use another method, and this statement is extremely far-fetched. In the culturally advanced United States, how can medicine be so childish? There is no military doctor in the boat?</p>
<p>However, this film is considered good among naval films.</p>
<p>Lady on a Train</p>
<p>The three interludes are very far-fetched. The camera tries its best to flatter Deanna Durbin, and at the same time, there are many close-up shots. The story, except for the interludes of singing, is not bad.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Edward Everett Horton is very good, and Deanna Durbin is just adequate, not as good as "Hers to Hold". But it is better than "Something for the Boys", "Can't Help Singing" and other films.</p>
<p>The Kid from Texas</p>
<p>The most general criticism is that this film is better than "The Outlaw". The arrangement of a barber and news reporter character is the most interesting.</p>
<p>Constance Bennett is old, and Broderick Crawford and Warren William are adequate.</p>
<p>The additional short films are excellent. They are all old Hollywood song and dance scenes. Among them, the swimming pool section, if color is added, will not lose to "Bathing Beauty."</p>
<p>The Bandit of Sherwood Forest</p>
<p>The final sword fight is wonderful; the jewelry selling in the front section is good, but the section before that is not good.</p>
<p>Actors</p>
<p>There are really few good actors this week. Cary Grant, who was originally ranked third last week, can be promoted to first this week.</p>
<p>(1) Cary Grant (in "Destination Tokyo")</p>
<p>(2) Red Skelton (in "Bathing Beauty")</p>
<p>(3) Owl and Rabbit (in "Bambi")</p>
<p>Outstanding ones are worth mentioning here.</p>

<h3>The Sound of Insects on an Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Do you like to listen to the sound of insects on an autumn night?</p>
<p>I think the sound of insects on an autumn night is like a group of skilled and lovely little musicians holding a lively ensemble on the empty wilderness.</p>
<p>Cast aside your sorrows, close your heart, put all the worldly affairs in the vastness of the sky, leaving only a hazy soul, immersed in a clear realm like water. At that time, you will never gnash your teeth and hate your enemies; nor will you use a fine pen to write any boring verses; nor will you be indignant or shed tears. You will only smile slightly, letting memory bloom in the music of "squeak... squeak..."</p>
<p>If you are a gentleman with a beard, you will still remember the green grass, wildflowers, mud mounds, stones, and good companions riding on the backs of cows in the suburbs. …</p>
<p>If you are a gray-haired lady, you will still remember the bright moon in the courtyard, your sister's smile, and your mother's gentle lullaby. …</p>
<p>As for me? Let me tell you, I will still remember those kinds of hazy stories:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a lazy poor woman. Every day her husband asked her to weave cloth, but she always secretly hid the yarn and didn't weave at all. Later, one day her husband fell ill and asked her to take the woven cloth out to sell it for rice. She couldn't produce it. Her husband was so angry that he killed her with a knife. So, from that year on, every autumn night there would always be a small insect calling in the wilderness, the sound like weaving cloth. People called it "spinning maiden", said to be that lazy woman repenting, mourning and crying.</p>
<p>You want to laugh at the absurdity of this story, right? I'm laughing so hard I can't close my mouth!</p>
<p>The sound of insects on an autumn night is indeed very cute. I hope you can pay attention and listen.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lin</h3>
<p>— Xie Beicheng</p>
<p>Mr. Lin glanced at the slip of paper, on which was written:</p>
<p>"Received from your teacher, a donation of 15,000 yuan in full, hereby."</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, picked up a pen and signed three words on it: Lin Ruhai. He looked at these three beautiful words with some sadness. Since he imitated Zhao Songxue at the age of thirteen, now that he is in his thirties, he may not be as good as Zhao Songxue, but he is much stronger than the "Qianlong Imperial Brush" kind of soft and boneless writing. But now he still has to wait for this 15,000 yuan teacher donation to be used.</p>
<p>A little embarrassed, he handed the slip of paper to the accountant with a blushing face, fanning himself with a practice book:</p>
<p>"It's so hot."</p>
<p>It seemed that it was too hot, and he had been bowing his head for too long, writing, and the blood had rushed to his head.</p>
<p>The accountant didn't pay attention to these things, he just kept his head down counting the banknotes, counting them once, then counting them again, counting them once, then counting them again, counting them once, then counting them again, counting them endlessly, he looked like an old postal worker troubled by his duties, his eyes were blurred as he looked at the sold stamps and the received banknotes.</p>
<p>After counting for a long time, Mr. Lin Ruhai, who was standing next to him, had already seen clearly: five thousand-yuan bills, five four-hundred-yuan bills, and six five-hundred-yuan bills, one five is five, four five is twenty, five six is thirty, a total of ten thousand yuan. It was hard to finish counting, and he raised his head and stuffed the banknotes into Mr. Lin's hand:</p>
<p>"A small token, a small token, ha, students' playthings!"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's hands were a little trembling, before he had time to think of anything else, the accountant put his mouth to Mr. Lin's ear and chattered, then slapped Mr. Lin's shoulder hard with his thick palm, and said loudly:</p>
<p>"This Mr. Lin must be happy, if it weren't for this matter, the principal would have asked me to issue the appointment letter for next semester this morning, Mr. Lin can go home and receive it…" He gasped for breath, as if thinking about something, and suddenly narrowed his thin eyes again:</p>
<p>"Tuition fees will increase next semester. 120,000 for lower primary school, 150,000 for upper primary school, what about teachers' salaries? Naturally, naturally ha…"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin put a wry smile on the corner of his mouth, and raised the ten thousand yuan teacher donation—naturally, the receipt said fifteen thousand yuan—and nodded to the accountant:</p>
<p>"Goodbye, goodbye!"</p>
<p>Stepping out of the threshold of the pavilion, he remembered something, and turned his head back, almost tripping over the stairs:</p>
<p>"The opening day for next semester, has it been decided yet?"</p>
<p>The accountant faced him and grinned maliciously:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin is an old teacher, asking too amateurishly, the enrollment advertisement says it's August 25th, naturally, naturally…"</p>
<p>"Will it be delayed for a few days?"</p>
<p>"If there aren't enough students, we'll wait a few days. Classes will start in mid-September anyway. It's hot, so it's good to rest a few more days!"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin felt a little depressed, he had wanted to find a way to improve his environment for a long time, but: his stomach rumbled, he was a little hungry.</p>
<p>The ten thousand yuan in his hand might be enough to eat seven or eight bowls of ribs noodles, but, alas, the tuition for primary school also costs 120,000, and the child Xiaolingzi at home… he almost burst into tears,——poor child, you were born into the wrong family, I'm afraid you'll have to drop out of school this semester.</p>
<p>The accountant's words rang in his ears:</p>
<p>"What about teachers' salaries? Naturally, naturally…"</p>
<p>A bright sun shone into his heart, it was a sunny day, and he believed a saying! "As the tide rises, so does the boat, and the boat will naturally straighten when it reaches the bridge." There is always a way, there is no hurdle that cannot be overcome.</p>
<p>But he was still reluctant to take a fraction of this ten thousand yuan to eat a bowl of ribs noodles, he carefully touched the pocket containing the ten thousand yuan, afraid that the sixteen pieces of paper money would grow wings and fly out.</p>
<p>Today is another sunny day, so the sun shines brightly on the street, but it's getting hot again. Mr. Lin's head is sweating. There is still a long way to go home. These past few years, his body has been weak, and he feels tired after walking a little. It would be nice to find a place to rest.</p>
<p>The sun was just a little slanted, and there was very little shade on the street. He walked along the wall, when suddenly something attracted him:</p>
<p>On the wall, in red watercolor, was written: "Air conditioning open"!</p>
<p>Above it were also written the words "Metropolis Theater," naturally, and "Today's Premiere," etc. Mr. Lin was not interested in these things. What he was most interested in was resting for a while in the wide hall outside the ticket counter. The cold air leaking out of the theater was enough to refresh his heart and soul.</p>
<p>He pushed open the bright glass door and walked in. The first movie had not yet ended, and it was still early before the second movie started. There were only three or four people in the hall—two men and women pointing and poking at the pictures over there, and three two women and one man leaning against the corner of the door telling jokes.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin thought to himself:</p>
<p>"These are really movie buffs, running over so early to wait for the premiere, really unbearable petty bourgeoisie!"</p>
<p>He remembered that there was such a sentence in a new literary book. However, the three young people over there were staring at him, so he had no choice but to pretend to be an "unbearable petty bourgeois" and go to the window to look at the pictures.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin was not in the mood to look at these miscellaneous pictures. He was going to rest here for a while and then go to look at the appointment letter that had just been sent home, and Xiaolingzi's tuition…</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's elbow was bumped by someone:</p>
<p>"Sir…"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin was startled, and fixed his eyes on what was in front of him. He was also staring at a picture, which showed a pretty woman being hugged and kissed hard by a mustachioed man. His face turned red all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Blushing, he looked to the side:</p>
<p>A girl—one of those three unbearable petty bourgeoisie—stood next to him, holding a large stack of books:</p>
<p>"Sir, buy a copy, help poor students!"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin looked at the book. He was unfamiliar with this kind of book, and—he touched his pocket again, the ten thousand yuan was still there.</p>
<p>"Sir, buy a copy, two thousand yuan a copy, help poor students go to school…"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin was really embarrassed. He knew he shouldn't have come in to cool off. Bah, still pretending to be a petty bourgeois! Bah, bah, bah!</p>
<p>He struggled for a long time, and blurted out a few words:</p>
<p>"I am a poor teacher!"—How embarrassing!</p>
<p>The girl was not embarrassed, it was truly difficult for her to say:</p>
<p>"Sir, you are too polite, teachers all hope that poor students can go to school, and it's just like watching an extra movie!"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin wanted to slap himself twice. When had he ever watched a movie? Why did he have to come to the movie theater to cool off and rest!</p>
<p>There was no way, he stuffed two thousand yuan into the girl's hand, and exchanged it for the book that was so unfamiliar to him—it really felt like cutting off Mr. Lin's flesh!—He no longer wanted to cool off, the longer he stayed, the more sweat beads would come out.</p>
<p>He hurriedly slipped out of the Metropolis Theater, calculating that half of the 15,000 yuan on the receipt was already gone, and what about Xiaolingzi's tuition? …</p>
<p>The sun in his heart shone again: "What about teachers' salaries? Naturally, naturally…"</p>
<p>He had to hurry back to look at the appointment letter. When he entered the door, the appointment letter was lying quietly on the desk, which said:</p>
<p>"…Next semester, we plan to hire Mr. Lin as a fifth-grade homeroom teacher, with a salary provisionally set at 85,000 yuan per month…"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin sighed and shouted loudly: "Xiaolingzi, you should also apply for student aid!"</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>— By Fa, Provence (produced in the autumn Salon of 1945)</p>
<h3>The Life of a Musician</h3>
<p>— Jia Hui</p>
<p>In the early days of World War I, there was a popular song called "It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary." This song can be said to be the most popular military song, but its author, Jack Judge, had to rush to the fish market during the day and put on makeup at night in order to make a living.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 26</p>
<p>"In 1933, we met again in Shenyang. I was working as a correspondent for the Japanese branch of the ×× News Agency, but in reality, I was a amphibious freelance writer of intelligence and journalism. At that time, most of the Japanese conspiracies, especially the conspiracies arranged by the Japanese for the League of Nations investigation team, were revealed by me…</p>
<p>"However, the credit is all due to Tsurumi Tamaki's efforts, (Sorry, I was working in this dangerous environment, first of all, I had to completely pretend that Chengzhi was a purely Japanese bloodline; even in my dreams, I couldn't reveal a single flaw, I had to keep being "Tsurumi"). …</p>
<p>"Originally, in the year he participated in the internship at the staff headquarters of the dispatch army, his adoptive mother passed away. The vacation to arrange the funeral at home became a major turning point in his life career—in his adoptive mother's box, he found a notebook and several handwriting of his father, especially the long letter written in danger. At the same time, he Liu was dissatisfied with the "decadent" style of people like Doihara; plus, he unintentionally discovered that he was a direct descendant of the Yellow Emperor, and his father was a revolutionary pioneer, so he was determined to avenge his motherland and do a great job…</p>
<p>"As a result, he himself decided to take on this dangerous role, secret within secret. However, the basic problem was that he had to first establish his foothold firmly before he could take action. For this, he concentrated his target on the communications section. Because this is the central hub of all news. As for other positions, he knew that, no matter what, he could not climb very high according to his age. If the position is not high, then what is the use of secretly inquiring about a little bit of overnight news? … Therefore, he chose the communications section as his position. …</p>
<p>"After more than a year of hard work, he invented a special code that was more ingenious than the original and had no drawbacks. Because of this achievement, he was immediately promoted to deputy section chief of the telecommunications section. When we met, he was already the chief of the section. At the same time, he also recruited some comrades—"complex" comrades, to slowly start working. …</p>
<p>"As for the role played by the brother, there are two names; one is their secretary, and the other is the Chinese affairs consultant. He also created some achievements for me, just to solidify the trust of those ghosts and demons, and consolidate my position, so the name "Yue Yang" is acceptable in the staff headquarters".</p>
<p>"I admire, I admire". Mr. W praised repeatedly, "No wonder we have repeatedly received mysterious reports from KCC, it turns out that this is the case. It is gratifying that our first line of special operations has been advanced into their staff headquarters"!</p>
<p>"That's how you can say it, but the Japanese devils are very cunning, and the internal affairs are also very discordant; therefore, even with our position, sometimes we can only find out 40 to 50 percent of all the quiet information. Also, the Black Dragon Society, that is a major base for secret operations. Although Tsurumi has some connections, it is also a way to use each other. Now he wants to officially join, as long as his boss ×× is willing to help…" …</p>
<p>—The above is the general outline of my conversation with Mr. W. Because it has been eight or nine years, the memory cannot be very accurate, and the dialogue is also very trivial, so it cannot be written according to the original dialogue. You think, Mr. W is a very busy person. He has phone calls and telegrams in just a few minutes, allocating work, and there are also things that must be dealt with in person. These few tens of minutes of conversation were interrupted no less than twenty or thirty times. All the conversations involved some repetitions and interludes. If I were to write it down stroke by stroke, I am afraid that you would not be patient with these trivialities.</p>
<p>—Before leaving, Mr. W opened the door and closed it again:</p>

<p>Random Talks on Life</p>
<h3>What is Friendship</h3>
<p>We are all mortals, unable to escape the six senses and six dusts. Often, when we suffer grievances or troubles, we long for a confidant to whom we can pour out our hearts and weep. This intangible feeling expresses the need for friendship.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, the first requirement for the existence of friendship is the elimination of vested interests. By vested interests, I mean obligations, legal constraints, or commercial ties. Therefore, father and son, siblings... sometimes find it difficult to develop friendship. A father and son cannot be intimate, not because of the difference in age, but because the father cannot talk to the son about "Dream of the Red Chamber" or "Nine-tailed Turtle," and the son cannot talk to the father about romance. They both carry a degree of false dignity or obedience; the relationship between the two is false and lacks genuine affection. Brothers are jealous and suspicious of each other in the pursuit of the same goals. Neither of these can produce sincere friendship.</p>
<p>We cannot make friends from childhood and maintain those friendships until old age, not because people today value righteousness less than the ancients, but because of environmental factors. I remember having a friend in middle school with whom I shared a bed and had late-night talks. But forced by circumstances, we parted ways and have not communicated since. Is this my betrayal? Is it his lack of fidelity?</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhuangzi's explanation of pure friendship is the most wonderful. He said, "To look at each other and weep, to be mutually agreeable at heart." Only this kind of friendship counts as complete. Besides this heart-to-heart connection, you must also need me and I must need you.</p>
<p>Han Yu said, "To study alone without friends is to be ignorant." We can interpret the word "study" broadly. For example, two friends who love Peking opera can certainly talk about Mei Lanfang. Another point is that friendship is not necessarily built on the personalities of the two people. Jean-Christophe (Note 1) and Olivier can be considered close friends, but their personalities are not the same. One is of strong German descent, while the other is of gentle French descent. Similarly, David Copperfield and Steerforth (Note 2), the former timid and elegant, the latter reckless and vulgar, also developed deep affection. David never remembered Steerforth's faults but only his virtues. Therefore, I believe that differences in personality are not an obstacle to friendship, but the distance cannot be too great, and it depends on the two people's sense of humor and tolerance.</p>
<p>Aroshchenko said, "Chicks always prefer to play with goslings, and ducklings go with ducklings." So if you are an opera fan, then I hope you make friends with opera enthusiasts. If you have a sense of humor or tolerance, then after three months you will also be able to sing a few lines of "Xipi Erhuang."</p>
<p>The occurrence of friendship is not as troublesome as love between men and women. Friendship does not distinguish between rich and poor (like Jia Baoyu and Qin Zhong), does not distinguish nationality (like Romain Rolland and Tolstoy, Flaubert and Turgenev), does not distinguish between ancient and modern (like Wang Guowei and Li Houzhu, Lin Yutang and Yuan Zhongdao). On a voyage, in a journey, in a factory or school, we can always find our understanding companion.</p>
<p>To put it scarily, a person without friends must be suffering from mental illness.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Jean-Christophe is the protagonist in Romain Rolland's novel.</p>
<p>(Note 2) David Copperfield is the protagonist of Dickens' "David Copperfield." (Mei Ruo)</p>
<h3>This Trend Should Be Encouraged</h3>
<p>— Jiezi</p>
<p>Yesterday, local news reported: "A Russian offered a bribe to Guo Ziqing, an employee of the Public Utilities Bureau's Fourth Division, which Mr. Guo refused. This was witnessed by Mr. Yang Sen (a Westerner), a commissioner of the UNRRA and director of transportation. Mr. Yang sent a letter to Director Zhao of the bureau to report the matter and express his admiration."</p>
<p>How do you feel about this news? Although it is a public servant's duty not to accept bribes, in this "year of corruption," it is worth praising.</p>
<p>Indeed, looking back at the year since the victory, what we see in the newspapers are countless cases of ×× billions of yuan of fraud, ×× corruption, ×× bribery, ... so many that it is not surprising. Now, there is a news story of refusing a bribe, just like being tired of eating appetizers and changing to a different flavor.</p>
<p>Foreigners unanimously believe that corruption cases are everywhere in our country. The impression is too bad. Now, Mr. Guo's integrity was actually witnessed by foreigners, which is not a trivial matter.</p>
<p>In today's Chinese society, the spirit of integrity is not widespread enough. In addition to paying tribute to Mr. Guo, we should shout: "The trend of refusing bribes should be encouraged!"</p>
<h3>The Blue Danube</h3>
<p>— Luo Ting</p>
<p>One of the history and geography questions in the new student exam of a certain school was: "What is the famous river in Europe?"</p>
<p>One student answered: "The Blue Danube." I don't know how he came up with this answer, he must be a music fan.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: "The Blue Danube" is a waltz composed by the king of waltzes, Johann Strauss.)</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>
<p>— San Gong</p>
<p>The municipal government's implementation measures for the clean district system state: "...strive to clean the streets and alleys and remove the accumulated garbage from the past." In fact, what is "accumulated from the past" and urgently needs to be removed is not just garbage!</p>
<p>"Scraping from everyone's heads" should be cursed, but "scraping" for disaster relief is a praiseworthy thing, and it is hoped that there will be a big "scrape," the more the better.</p>
<p>Eight years of suffering, and "suffering" is still not over. Not only is it "difficult" for parents in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but even children's schooling has encountered unprecedented "difficulties."</p>
<p>In last month's expenditure items of the municipal government, education and culture only accounted for 9.94%, while police fees accounted for 26.56%. I am afraid that one day, there will be more police officers on the streets than students!</p>
<h3>Do You Know "Money"?</h3>
<p>— Mo Gao</p>
<p>It's not about asking people for money, it's about taking money from our labor!</p>
<p>Knowing money is the beginning of understanding life.</p>
<p>Money that does not come from labor is someone else's sweat! Someone else's tears! Someone else's blood!</p>
<p>People with money are not necessarily happy, and people without money are not necessarily in pain.</p>
<p>The enemy is always the enemy of man!</p>
<p>If there is a man-eating demon in the world, this demon is money.</p>
<p>Those who fantasize about money will eventually have their lives taken by this demon.</p>
<p>Originally, there would be no slaves in the world. Because money is controlled by a few evil people;</p>
<p>So vulnerable people succumb.</p>
<p>For people with money, money begets money.</p>
<p>For people without money, money eats money.</p>
<p>You cannot judge people by their appearance, nor can you judge people by their money.</p>
<p>Money is a temptation, like the allure of beauty and the intoxication of good wine.</p>
<p>People who work hard have no money, people who have money don't work hard.</p>
<p>Dogs wag their tails and beg their owners for meat bones.</p>
<p>Slaves flatter their masters for money.</p>
<p>Numbness, fatigue, depression, and disappointment always belong to those who fantasize about money.</p>
<p>Do not use money to know people, nor use people to know money.</p>
<p>Originally, people would never bow their heads to others, but for money, people bow their heads!</p>
<p>Expenses should be less than income, not more than income.</p>
<p>This way, without the worry of money, happiness will always be around you!</p>
<p>For people without money, wanting money is "to survive."</p>
<p>For people with money who still want more money, it is "greed."</p>
<p>Being praised for having money is not praising your character.</p>
<p>Being praised for having no money is true praise!</p>
<h3>A Coincidence</h3>
<p>— Li Liying</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I went to the Ningbo Road ×× Bank to pay my tuition fees. I used all my strength to squeeze onto a trolley bus. I bought a copy of Shen Bao. When I mentioned the words "Pickpocket Insider" in your publication, I touched my pocket. When I saw the words "Beware of Pickpockets" in the middle, I touched my pocket again. After reading the last sentence, "Dear readers, beware of pickpockets!" I looked at the people around me and touched my pocket again. Unexpectedly, the tuition fees were gone.</p>
<p>It's so wonderful, so coincidental! So painful! After being indignant, I wrote this to report to you, sir. I wonder if you believe that there is such a coincidence in the world? Could it be that this article in your publication has the same effect as a "pickpocket opening a tie shop"?</p>

<h3>Comic Strip: The Adventures of Sanmao the Soldier (96)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>On Reforming English Teaching</h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>In order to improve English teaching in middle schools, the Ministry of Education has convened two "English Teaching Research Conferences" in Chongqing. Recently, it held the third conference in Beijing. Principals, professors, and relevant personnel from the Ministry of Education attended. The main points of each proposal can be divided into the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) Junior high school English focuses on the preliminary training of speaking, reading, and writing? Senior high school focuses on the cultivation of reading ability, followed by conversation and writing.</p>
<p>(2) English is designated as a compulsory subject in both senior and junior high schools, with six hours of instruction per week.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry will organize a "Middle School English Teaching Research Committee" to improve teaching.</p>
<p>(4) It is planned to establish specialized English schools from next year to train specialized teachers of English for middle schools.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that English teaching has been valued by the national education community. According to the high school curriculum published by the Ministry of Education on September 8, 1934, English classes in high school are five hours per week within three academic years. Revised and published on February 18, 1936, the middle school curriculum standards state: English in commercial middle schools is taught for five hours per week, and four hours per week in junior high schools. In the future, it will be increased to six hours per week.</p>
<p>I believe that the Ministry of Education's plan to reform English teaching in middle schools is undeniable from an academic standpoint. However, other original courses should still maintain a balanced proportion, and should not be given preference to some over others. Otherwise, even if the intention is good, it will inevitably be slandered by a few people and used as a "pretext" for ulterior motives.</p>
