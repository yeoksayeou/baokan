<h3>馬歇爾魏德邁會商　議題集中東北局勢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶七日電〕美駐華特使馬歇爾將軍，視察前國共兩軍發生衝突之各地區師來後，曾與中國戰區美軍司令魏德邁將軍有所商議。衆信馬魏二氏之議題，集中於東北局勢與國共兩軍之合併問題，魏德邁將軍此次來渝，寄寓於馬歇爾將軍之重慶寓所，</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶七日電〕中國戰區美軍司令魏德邁中將，昨夜與今日兩度謁蔣主席商談，又訪馬歇爾特使討論，諒係商討國軍運往東北與遣送日軍民回國等問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶六日電〕美特使馬歇爾將軍，政府代表張治中，共黨代表周恩來出行巡視中國尙有軍事衝突發生各地，歷時一星期，，已於六日返抵重慶。三巨頭曾輕過北平，濟南，徐州，太原，延安及漢口，促令當地國軍及共軍司令作維持和平之保證。據隨行記者稱：馬歇爾特使曾在某數塲所發表堅決之談話，聲稱今後兩月，將爲中國未來命運中最關緊要之時期。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本市七日訊〕美致中蘇兩國抗　蘇軍搬走東北「戰利品」之照會之公布，將使「東北問題」揭開。馬歇爾將軍似有可能被邀以探求目前危機之解決方法。馬歇爾爲杜魯門總統特使叙大使級，故有權照顧美國在華，包括柬北在內之一切利益。由於中國政府之聘請，馬歇爾茲正祖任三人小組委員會之主席，北平之軍事調處執行總部有權可於東北行動，即派遣陣地視察小組，前往該處阻止衝突，指定國共兩軍應行接收之區域，及整編常地之國共軍隊是也。以大使之階級，渠亦有權派遣美方代表前往東北，尤其可有權照顧東北各地之美方商業與其他一切利益。蘇聯拒絕中美合組之陣地視察小組與美方官員進入東北之舉，可能產生一嚴重之國際危機。中國政府對於此事，採取官方沉默熊度，圖阻止一「正式危機」之發生。馬歇爾將軍設或被邀處理東北問題，則渠將面對一遠較調停中國內戰或整編統一中國陸軍之艱鉅工作，更形微妙之問題。蘇聯之參加陣地視察小糾會談，似屬可能之一事，因此舉可减輕蘇方對於美國在華活動之疑慮。</p>

<h3>專論　什麽是合作金庫</h3>
<p>— 夏高波</p>
<p>上海市合作金庫籌備委員會，曾於上月二十七日舉行常務委員會會議，出席者有市社會局，中國農民銀行，上海市銀行，中國農工銀行及各合作社代表十餘人，由社會部合作事業特派員陳仲明氏主席，已擬定各個單位股金認額，決定由市政府，中國農民銀行，中國農工銀行，上海市銀行，全國合作處滬分處，暨本市各合作社等單位發起一次認足，共計國幣一萬萬元，即日起至三月二十日止爲股金繳納期，由中農，農工和市銀行三家代收，預期四月間可吿成立云。</p>
<p>合作金庫是合作社的一種，是一種由許多合作社聯合組織而成的合作社聯合社，以調節合作事業資金爲宗旨。嚴格的照合作金庫規程上稅，它的社員（即通常股東的意思）是合作社，它的顧吝也是合作社，而不是個人。在合作金庫的任務上說，很像中央銀行；中央銀行是銀行的銀行，合作金庫是合作社的合作社。簡單地說一句，它是許多合作社共有的一個合作金融機構，以調節各合作社金融爲宗旨的。</p>
<p>合作金庫也是法人，其責任有兩種：（一）有限責任，（二）保設責任。有限責任的合作金庫，其社員（非個人）對於該金庫所負責任以其所認股金爲，正和股份有限公司的股東所負的責任相同。保證責任的合作　　　　社員對於該金庫所負的責任以其所認股金的數倍爲限，　　英國的保證有限公司，至於其所加的一倍數」應該幾倍，法無强制規定，得由各金庫在拿程中自行訂定，當然最少是一倍了，所謂「一倍」（即加倍）就是假定認股國幣一百萬元的便要負二百萬元的責任。合作金庫可以分爲四種，</p>
<p>（一）中央合作金庫監督機關，經濟部。顧客身分：省及直隸行政院之市合作金庫，暨以全國爲範圍的合作社聯合社。</p>
<p>A省合作金庫監督機關；省以上合作主管機關：顧客身分：縣市合作金庫及以省爲範圍之合作社聯合社。</p>
<p>（二）B直隸行政之市合作金庫　監督機關：直隸行政院之市以上之合作機關。顧客身分：該區域內信用合作社及各種合作社聯合社。</p>
<p>（三）縣市合作金庫監督機關：縣市以上合作主管機關。顧客身分：該區域內信用合作社及各種合作社聯合社。</p>
<p>（四）縣市以下的區域，于必要時得設合作金庫代理處，其任務得由常地信用合作社或信用合作社聯合社行使之。</p>
<p>合作金庫旣分四種方式，它的資金來源也就不同：（一）中央合作金庫，由省及直隸行政院之市合作金庫，暨以全國爲範圍的合作社聯合社共同認股組織之。（二）省合作金庫以縣市合作金庫及以省爲範圍的合作社聯合社共同認股組織之。（三）直隸行政院之市合作金庫及縣市合作金庫，由各該區域內信用合作社及各種合作社聯合社共同認股組織之。世界合作運動導源甚古，但是我國合作運動自發　至今尙不到三十年，消費合作生產合作也還在推行時期，合作金庫更屬試辦時期，整個合作組織的體系和行政監督根本還不甚嚴密與淸楚，所以爲提倡合作金庫的成立起見，各級政府，農民銀行，地方銀行，及其他辦理農貸的民營銀行以及其他不以營利爲目的的法團，都許酌認股金，以便成立。由中國農民銀行恊助投資而成立的合作金庫在抗戰期內的大後方是很多的，據民國廿九年該行的報告，已成立者有二百餘縣，供給資金的國幣三千八百餘萬元（參見民國廿九年九月出版之中美周刋第一卷第五十期拙作「中國戰時農村金融機關」一文）。這一次尙在籌備中的上海市合作金庫便也是這種性質。</p>
<p>合作金庫的資本總額國府前頒的「合作金庫規程」有最低額的規定，中央合作金庫資本總額至少國幣一千萬元，省合作金庫及直隸行政院之市合作金庫至少國幣一百萬元，縣市合作金庫至少國幣十萬元。這項最低額規定，時過境遷，當然不合時宜了。合作金庫增减資本，都必須經代表大會通過，並呈報主管官署核准，方爲有效。</p>
<p>合作金庫的組織，依照規程規定爲：</p>
<p>代表大會—理事會—監事會—經理—副經理—襄助經理—（必要時得有）。</p>
<p>合作金庫是一個合作金融機關，所以它的業務當然與銀行相似，以辦理存款放款匯兌及其他代理收付等爲業務，除經營這些業務外，合作金庫的營業資金絕對不得作其他任何事業的投資，這是規程內有明文規定的。</p>
<p>合作金庫旣以合作社爲對象，以調節合作社金融爲宗旨，所以它的使命前面已經說過，很與中央銀行彷彿。我國合作事業至今還沒有發達，合作社的力量旣不普遍又不很大；抗戰八年，兵　遍野，農民經濟財力幾被破壞殆盡，在廣大的收復區要建立起一個普遍的合作網，實在不是一件容易的事。即使有了合作社，其資力也決不會雄厚，所以合作金庫之金融援助，實在有迫切的需要，我們期望上海市合作金庫迅速地成立起來，扶助附近的合作社日趨發達，日趨健全。物價瘋狂得這樣于，合作運動眞是一支救世軍哩。</p>
<p>合作社需要合作金庫，同樣的，合作金庫也必需要有合作社，他底資金才能有出路，才能作有效的運用，眞所謂「相得益彰」。方今物價瘋在得這樣子，農村金融的疲弱，實在是最最嚴重的一個問題。我國百分之七十九以上的民衆是農民，農民的購買力薄弱，生活沒有保障，經濟復員便談不上，經濟建設也談不上，全國工業化列是夢想。要挽救農村，不使破產，除了廣大農貸之外，普遍合作事業實不失爲一個好辦法，那麼强力合作金庫，不是一件很重要的大事嗎？</p>

<h3>整理道路系統便利交通　界路首先拓寬　業已決定月內動工　浙江路建築一部改騎樓</h3>

<p>拆除下層作人行道</p>
<p>界路拓寬工程動工後，第二直貫北車站之浙江路路面寬放至二十公尺，惟以浙江路市面繁盛，人口稠密，故決定先自浙江南路及浙江北路動工，中段則俟兩段之工程完成後，再行動工。凡屬鋼骨水泥建築，則拆除其下層，改造騎樓，作爲行人通，倣公館馬路之房屋建造。復次，工務局並計劃將北西藏路，新民路路面放寬，該項計劃，已呈遞市府請核中。</p>

<h3>九家百貨公司宣佈自動停業　對勞方要求不再讓步四千職工昨集體請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕永安·先施·新新·大新·中國國貨·　華。友信·中華·麗安等九大百貨公司，自上月二十三日發生工潮以來，已將牛月。雖經社會局五次調解，終因底薪問題不能妥協，故迄未解決。前日下午三時至五時，各公司職工實行示成，怠工二小時，催促資方讓步。九公司資方經共同商討後，亦採取一致行動，於昨日上午九時一刻起，宣佈自動停業。</p>
<p>開緊急會議</p>
<p>三千餘職工立刻召集緊急會議，商討對策。決議向各有關當局呈請，責令資方立即復業，並於下午二時作四千人之集體遊行，赴社會局請願，要求常局秉公處理。以爲資方之自動停業，係不合法行動，請予制裁。據勞方代表吿記者，新新。永安兩公司資方，對勞方之要求曾一度表示接受，後因九公司資方聯合組織成功，於是對勞方不再讓步，採取強硬態度，甚至不惜宣吿淸理，對一部份職工或將解雇云。又稱職工之底薪要求，原爲七十九元，後經一再讓步减爲六十九元，但資方僅允四十元，堅持不再增加。</p>
<p>裁定書送出</p>
<p>社會局因調解不能成立，故於昨晨向雙方致送決定書，規定職員底薪爲六十元，助理職員五十元，練習生四十五元，依照當月之生活指數隨時升降。但因資方突然宣佈自動停業，故形勢益形惑化。聞市商會已函資方勸其復業，各有關當局亦密切注意其發展云。</p>

<h3>中行准預結遠期外滙後　金融市塲起波動</h3>
<p>甲種經營行號申請者近百家</p>
<p>昨日本市金融市場，又起波動黃金美鈔同時高漲。其波動原因盛傳係由於中央銀行開出四五六月份遠期外匯匯率，較即期爲高所致。但中央銀行當局則鄭重否認，謂中央銀行昨日所宣布之美匯率，仍爲二〇二〇元，全日未動。惟因進口商所購訂外貨，其進口時期，不能預定，爲便利商家經營進口業務起見，故特准許預結四五六等月份之外匯。其匯率凡即期仍爲二〇二〇元，自即日起至四月七日止，爲二一二〇元，五月七日止爲二二二〇元，六月七日止爲二三三〇元。其匯率之所以較即期爲高者，則因加上利息所致。目前黑市利息太高，須二角以上，此次中行所定利息，尙不到五分云。又外匯審核處收到申請准許甲種經營行號者，統計有九十五家之多。按第一天十三家，第二天卅八家，第三天卅三家，第四天十一家。經紀人經營外匯者亦有十五起。</p>

<h3>各方買氣大盛　金市漲風又熾　美鈔跟漲一二〇元</h3>
<p>烚赤昨縱續走俏，人心自前日經遠期外匯激動後，星星之火，復將燎原，證券獲利後，游資抵補黃金，金業自由賣買以及恢復市塲之說復盛，業中人紛紛鼓動，飾金掛高，來自四鄕之紙幣，又起兌金之風，最後由堅而恍惚，晨開尙平，開後在前收價左右徘徊殊久，迨後證券方面前來吸收，銀樓帮抵補籌碼，午後買風步熾，盤出一六〇萬外，午刻在一六五萬左右徘徊，午後飾金愈掛愈高，兌戶恐慌更甚，漲到一七六萬者凡兩度，高後似有某種壓力，恍惚中曾下落至一六五萬，而後　　，結果較前收再漲十二萬，飾金自十六萬八升至十九萬，最後十八萬，紋銀一千六，銀元反升至八八〇元買進，暗拆漸形平定，暗息自一角七至二角二。</p>

<h3>英美服務事業　新指標新機構突飛猛進</h3>
<p>— 王克寄</p>
<p>本報重慶航訊</p>
<p>本文著者王克先生於去年八月抵達美國，旅行紐約及各地，共五閱月·歸途由美至英，在英居留不及二月，奉電促歸，即經歐陸法國。瑞士。德國·奧國。義大利。希臘。伊朗。印度等。始於本年二月返抵重慶。集此次奉社會部之命出國考察社會服務事業，特注重有關社會服務中心站之各項事樂。此係首次報道，所述英美社會服務事業近况，簡而且要，足供各界參考——編者。</p>
<p>政策</p>
<p>英美之社會服務事業，純係人民自願供獻人力物力，配合國策輔助政府施政之不及，增進社會福利，此即爲其政策，亦即其目的。惟其統稱各異，在英稱社會服務，在美稱社會工作，近亦稱社會福利，或公共福利，其服務種類，因時因事而增减，但英美實多相同之處，如莞童福利，成人敎育，家庭福利，勞工福利，老弱殘廢救助，災難救濟，社會保險，職業介紹與指導，醫藥衛生，精神病治療，出征軍人及復員服務，育年服務，農村服務，居住及城市計劃，消費合作，行旅救助，，娛樂等。美國近史注意國內黑人之各項服務及國際間之服務，前者爲調和種族，後者爲澤被世界。上述各項，均爲政府已有或應有之施政範圍，亦爲政府應盡之責任，而人民出於仁愛，以社會服務方式輔助政府施政，由此論證，社會服務興政治建設，有密切關係，而爲促成理想政治建設之實現。</p>
<p>組織</p>
<p>英美社會服務事業多爲民間組織，在近年來，社會上已養成良好之社會服務風氣，不如昔時僅有宗敎團體，其各種社會服務團體之組織，大多分爲董事會及幹事部，不論地方性或全國性，係由董事會負責主持，幹事部員責辦事，政府爲發揚人民服務風氣，尊重其組織，並不須立案，亦不予以監督指揮，在英美人士以此項事業出於自願，亦不願受政府管轄，否則無形抑止其風氣矣。蓋以英美人民之負責心，有强度之發展，即董事會均切實管事，政府自可信任其爲之，故在英美地方或中央，並無管轄機關，政府雖因人民之需要，設立或辦理社會福利之行政機關或事業，如英美之勞工部及社會保險，職業介紹等事業，英之救助局，美之地方政府福利部，其中行政機關並不管轄民間團體，僅與聯　配合而爲一種施政，並不是社會服務事業。因此，英美社會服務事業，不論在戰時與平時，由於自由發展甚速，先由廣泛之各自產生近演進爲分工合作之聯緊。在美國全國性及各地有社會工作及募捐委員會，英國全國性及各地有社會服務委員會，均爲社會服務事業團體聯合組織，類似我國社會服務事業協進會，係謀如何分工合作，增進工作效率。如此次戰時美國男女靑年奮，全國天主敎社會服務會，全國猶太福利會，救世軍，全國行旅救助會六團體，聯合組織聯合服務社，即USO集中人力物力，爲前後方服務，成績卓著，極負時譽，並舉行聯合募捐，此即合作佳果。近英國于社會服務委員會，正在進一步展開各地社會服務委員會之加强與增設。上項團號組織在英美民間社會服務團體中，爲有組織有系統之團體，成績已日有顯著。其餘團體以服務種類區分，類別爲一，僅某地有某種需要產生而他處則無者，二，一臨時因需要產生相常時間解散者一，三，各地有數團體即有全國聯合會之組織者，四，各地宗敎團體所辦各種社會服務事業，均名稱繁多，此處不能一一列舉，現在英美社會服務事業團體，負有歷史悠久而普遍各地者，歸納計：（一），基督敎男女靑年會，（二），紅十字會，（英美紅十字會其服務範圍幷有救災·濟難·文化·交通。家庭福利。營養·娛樂等服務。平時分會普及各地，戰時推及軍中。）（三）童子軍，（四），友鄰會，（英稱Resicential　Settlement）美稱（Settlement在國內尙無適當譯名，其內容係爲鄰居服務。）（五），婦女俱樂部，以上五團體，前三者在我國知者甚多，後二者知者尙少，但　　其歷史與成績實與靑年會，紅十字會相等。綜上述英美青年會，紅十字會，友隣會，婦女俱樂部等四團體，其經常之工作重心，均寄託在社會服務中心處所，如男女靑年會，紅十字會之各地分會，友隣會各地之友隣屋，（Settlement　House）及婦女俱樂部除童子軍係屬廣泛這服務工作外，均以此種中心處所爲基礎，辦理各項服務。近英國全國社會服務委員會正展開發動鄕村服務所。在美國鄕村，正展開4H俱樂部，4H者，即頭—智（Head）心—德（Heart）手—技（Hand）體—身（Health）係十歲至二十歲之農民青年參加，現全國已有一，七〇〇，〇〇〇會員，此項運動爲農林部策動，在平時輔助政府推行政令，頗著功效，並有俱樂部部址，由此英美社會服務事業已趨向社會服務中心站之方式即類似我國戰時著者所辦之社會服務處，在美國地方政府亦有此項設施稱福利站。蓋此項中心站爲人民日常聚集之處，各項服務得以透過其組織廣達於民間，不僅福利人羣，民主精神之陶育亦有與焉。</p>
<p>經費</p>
<p>英美社會服務事業經費，純係出自捐助，不受政府輔員會，聯合當地各團體，每年各自擬定計劃配合需要，確定經費預算發動統一募捐，募捐時間一月或數月，均能如數得社會之作之實際報告及所列經費這詳確合理，取得社會之信仰，英國各團體雖多自行向社會募捐，近亦　向聯合募捐。在美國除聯合募捐外，並另有基金之捐助或募捐，係由富者出資，指定辦理福利事業，設會保管，因美政府徵收舉，但多以基金投資企業，以盈餘充作經費，如以之存款，則利息甚微，其次爲紀念某人或作某事發動募基金，作指定福利事業，但亦間有逕行募捐經費者，上項基金之捐助或募捐，英國亦多類同。在美國另有一種配合報紙向社會呼籲這捐助，例如去年十二月九日紐約時報贊助紐約社會服務社，猶太慈善聯合會，等六團體舉辦百案救助運動，將一百個需要救助之個人或家庭如何苦況，如何救助，需若干經費，每案詳列報端，幷繪圖描寫苦況待救。每案三百美金至一千美金，不及一旬，已告超過捐助者數元數十元數百元不等，或指定捐助一案或數案經費，此項運動自一九一二年起，每年一次，成績均甚佳，時屆冬令，類似我國冬令救濟運動，則其方法高超多矣。</p>
<p>人才</p>
<p>英美社會服務事業之人才分爲事業及志願，據美國社會工作人員恊會總幹事安　生告知：美國現有社會工作事業人員十萬人，由於社會工作學校出身者佔百分之二十，就業後受訓練者佔百分之二十，其餘百分之六十爲未受專業敎育者，內女子佔百分之八十五，但並無人事制度，全仗一顆熱誠的心，都能終身從事，英國在戰時專業人員亦增多，一時未能得統計數字。至志之風氣蓬勃，在戰時尤爲踴躍。如軍中服務及後方各項服務等，亦以女子佔多數，此項志願服務之人員，不避艱險，不受酬報，其服務精神至堪敬佩。關於社會服務工作人員專業這敎育，在美國有社會工作學校四十二所之多，大都屬於大學校，有如一學院，哥倫比亞大學及芝加哥大學之社會工作學校，辦理優良·尤負時譽。在英國雖無專校之設立，但在一九一八年，由各大學及服務團體等聯合組織專門委員會，指定各大學設有關社會服務之選課，並指定社會服務機關或團體實習，由數月至二年不等，分別由學校給予證書或學位，限於大學畢業生及經騐豐富之社會工作人員或在校學生志願選讀，此項辦法，旨在增進其對社會學及一般普通常識，得益者仍爲實習之經騐。此外英美已實行國際間社會服務工作人員之交換，參觀，實習及研究，以期擴大其學理與技術，著者代表我國已與英美洽商進行，當可力促其成。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜觀英美社會服務事業，基於（一）政府之鼓勵，寓鼓勵於不管，使人民服務這風氣逢勃。（二）仗專業人員之技術，業精於動，使服務事業之普遍發展，輔助施政，福國利民。此二基點，足爲吾人參攷之助，亦即著者此行觀感之結語。</p>

<h3>讀者意見　懲治漢奸私見</h3>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>勝利後大小漢奸先後落網，其八年內因飢寒煎迫而曾任僞職委任以下人員，中央已在處理漢奸條例中明白規定必須以罪行事實爲準，由人民吿訴或吿發，經偵查屬實後，方得以漢奸論處。究其用意，無非係對上項僞職人員愼審處理，期能無枉無縱，藉杜社會紛擾，爲促進團團結達成建國使命計，此種辦法，亦屬煞費苦心，但各地部隊及地方政府，類多未能仰體斯旨，輙以感情用事，任意聽取人民控吿，非法逮捕僞職人員，以致敲詐勒索，時有所聞。長此以往，永無寗日，非特累及無辜，造成貪汚機會，且怨望日深，一旦被迫挺而走險，妨碍地方治安與建國前途，何堪設想，鄙人係國民一份子，誠有不能已於言者，爰將管見所及，謹述於次：</p>
<p>（一）政府對已捕之漢奸儘速定讞，以昭大信。</p>
<p>（二）曾任僞職委任以下人員，明定人民檢舉期限，逾期即停止吿訴吿發，藉以集中人力，增强建國效能。</p>
<p>（三）任何部隊與地方政府處理漢奸案件，均應遵照中央法令辦理，違則以凟職論處，藉杜流弊。</p>
<p>以上諸點，雖不免遺漏之處，但攸關國計民生至鉅，敢誚貴報賜予刋載，藉張民意。蔣誠（三月三日）</p>

<p>自由談　婦女與家庭特輯</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>「養不教，父之過」</h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>我們時常在報紙上看到那些「脫離父子（或父女，母子，母女）關係」，「驅逐劣子聲明」的啓事，內中所說的不外乎：「逆子（或劣子）某某甘趨下流，與匪人為伍，屢戒不悛……脫離父子關係，嗣後倘在外向人借貸等情以及有任何不法行動，概與鄙人無涉」這一套話語。</p>
<p>當我看到了這種啓事，總覺得那些「不肖子」的父母把親子的關係看得太簡單淺薄了——簡直是中跟朋友一樣！而親子的關係可以這樣登一個啓事就是消滅，也看得太容易了！</p>
<p>親子的關係是有的可能嗎？世界上會有一個沒有父母的人嗎？親子間的生理上的關係，不是人為的力量所能消滅，更不是幾行啓事所能割斷這血統上的連繫；這在事實上是不可能，同時在父母的良心上也不容如此。</p>
<p>在這家庭猶不失爲社會組成單位的今日，家庭中的子女都應該由爲父母者負責善加敎養，一個人決不會生下來就有「甘趨下統」的習性，如果「甘趨下流」，這便是父母敎育的失敗，父母應負上失敗的責任，豈是「屢戒不悛」四字所得把責任輕輕推卸？當然，一個女的墮落，學校，社會也都有相當的關係，我們不能把責任不折不扣的全加諸父母的身上，但父母應負最大的責任，那是無可疑義的。一個子女墮落了，社會上多了一個—不，該說是多了一匹「害羣之馬」，這是爲父母者的罪行，應該深自引咎，反省反省自己平索敎養子女失當之處，和以後補救的方法。也許是父母本身的意識，行爲就不正確，不正當，那麼，「其身不正」，自然「雖令不行」了。果爾他們自身就先得痛改前非，加上一番修養工夫，施以「自我敎育」，使自己在家庭中發生示範作用。要曉得，在一個家庭中是不能有二重道德標準的，決不容做父母的藉口年老多病而抽大烟，却不許子女抽吸；做父親的藉口廣嗣而擁着三妻五妾，却不許兒子治遊的種種矛盾現象存在！</p>
<p>子女墮落了，父母們祗消幾行啓事就把一切的責任都推卸了。但誚問您的子女往何處去呢？尤其是在中國社會裏，社會是一向不負敎養的責任的。自然，乞丐，游民，盜賊娼妓等便是他們必然的蹄趨了。在父母們祗要子女不再去花用他們的錢，不再去牽累，攪擾他們，子女們在社會上任憑怎樣的爲非作惡，他們便「若越人視秦人之肥瘠」了。</p>
<p>「養不敎，父之過」，我認爲這一種不盡父母的職責的罪行，更在拋棄嬰兒於道旁之上。拋棄嬰兒固屬殘忍，但「驅逐劣子」則更將貽害社會。可是遺棄嬰孩在法律上有應得之罪，而「騙逐劣子」却不受法律的裁制！</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>封建勢力下的中國婦女</h3>
<p>— 萬紫</p>
<p>封建社會是以男性爲中心的社會，婦女在封建社會裏是毫無地位的，尤其是中國封建制度經過時期特別長，得到高度的發展，因而中國婦女所受到的東縛與不幸，也格外地深刻。</p>
<p>歷史上也有過作爲中國政治中心的女性，如武則天就是，她很有才能，是一位很出色的政治家，但這不過是偶然的一件事，並且當她執政時，並沒有改變當時婦女在社會上的地位，她男性似地做着皇，而她的蔬屬也都是男子。</p>
<p>二千多年以來的中國封建社會史，在發展階段上雖然各有其不完全相同的意識形態，但是爲封建社會統治階曆所擁護的孔子思想，却始終被提倡和崇拜，孔子對於婦女的態度是『唯女子與小人，爲難養也」，把小人和婦女並列，是頗有些階級意味的。小人是被統治的階級，被人歧視而驅使奔走的，女十當然也不能例外，她是被人供養和玩弄而存生着。</p>
<p>後來的學者們發揚孔夫子的女子和小人的理論，反覆引證，認定婦女是禍水，歷史上「女禍』的就是，因而婦女的地位就每况愈下，</p>
<p>爲了使婦女們在思想上，行動上不反抗，不越出被統治的範園，封建主義的學者們便訂出了許多婦女應該遵守的「美德」，還出了些專書，如烈女傳，女戾，女論語，女兒經，而這些書的綜合，總不外是三從，四德，這是大家都曉得的。</p>
<p>但是這些理論顯然還有些婦女不能够完全「遵守」，獎勵的方法便應運而生。在明淸的時候「烈女」最受人重視，很多貞節脾坊，都在這兩個時期建立了起來，然而對於違反的懲罰也特別厲害，謀害親夫比强盜殺人要罪大百倍，『七出條例』更是一件不可思議的法律，雖然這條例在這以前就有了。</p>
<p>封建社會對於婦女壓迫最高的表現，便具體地喊出「女子無才便是德」。女人不許護書，祗許在家裏做事情，同時把脚纏小，了在行動上永遠失去了自由。</p>
<p>近數十年來，從辛亥革命到抗戰勝利，中國婦女多少得到了部份的自由與解放，但封建殘餘顯然還沒有消減，這就說明了中國廣大的婦女羣——特別是晨村和小城市——所以還處於一種凄慘生活和不平等的境遇中的原因。</p>
<p>封建和婦女問題，有着不可分的密切關係，封建社會由於所經歷的時期特別長久，其根蒂也因而格外深固，解決婦女問題，也應同時消除殘餘的封建勢力。</p>
<h3>三八婦女節的起源</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>三八婦女節起源於美國。</p>
<p>一九〇九年三月，美國婦女界對於男女的不平等表示滿，於是在全國各大都市舉行了盛大的婦女節，各婦女團體都參加。這是國際婦女節的胚胎。</p>
<p>一九一〇年，丹麥京城哥本哈根開社會主義婦女大會，次議每年三月八日爲國際婦女節，以取得婦女選舉權和參政權爲目標，同時促進婦女在經濟上和社會地位上的解放。以後每年各國婦女都舉行三八婦女節。</p>
<p>三八婦女節就是這樣誕生的。</p>
<p>思想</p>
<h3>女子有才便是德（下）</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>看低道德漠視權力</p>
<p>說「女子無才便是德」的人，忽略了這兩點：第一，他們沒有認淸道之社會的意義，看小了道德的範圍，漠視了時代和社會變遷的因素，做一個不知進取，保守懦弱的女性，就被視爲是有德的女性；沒有正義感，沒有事業心，一味只知在男子的奴役下恭謙，忍受，寬讓，不表現一點個性，不流露一點感情，不知爲爭取自己的獨立的人格而努力，不知爲提高自己的知識和經濟的地位而學習，而工作，在愚昧中消度一生，如此謂之「德」，那簡直把道德的理想看得太低了，不，簡直看錯了道德之內在和外涵的意義了。第二，漢覦了這天地間最大的權力——知識。我們要知道充分的知識是我們良好行爲的引導，沒有眞知灼見，那會有崇高行爲的表現？古來許多立德的英傑，他們的壯烈義勇的德行，足垂千古而不朽，他們那一個不是有豐富的才學。岳武穆，文天祥，史可法等等歷史上偉大的愛國者，他們的赤膽熱心，都是知識給鍊成的，他們有一個很高尙的生活理想，他們知道正義和眞理所在，敵人和不便該妥協。他們在慨歎「讀聖賢書所學何事」之餘，便毅然捨生取義殺身成仁了。</p>
<p>道德行爲是知識的反映，也是知識的實踐，「知」與「行」固然是兩件事，但是兩者之間必取得聯繫，才可以表現出兩者的意義。王陽明倡「知行合一」之說，謂行由知而來。他認爲「有人知而不行」，實則「並非眞知」。國父力倡「知難行易」的學說，更是勉人要力求真知。中國在現代世界，是科學最落後，文化水準最低的國家，普及民智促進文化在建國過程中刻不容緩的；而中國的女子敎育更不普及，一般女子的知識很貧乏，受敎育的機會極少，這些愚味無知的女性，不但不能參加社會工作，做服務人羣的「社會的一員」，就是敎她們治家敎子，也因爲近代家庭常識的缺乏，够不上做一個理想的母親和妻子，所以當急之務便是要提高女子的知識水準，普及女子受敎育的機會。—在高唱「爭取女子參政權」「促進男女經濟地位均等」聲中，我們要把支配了數千年我國一般人頭腦的反動訓言「女子無才便是德」澈底取溪水了，趕快換上一句「女子有才便是德」！</p>
<p>古代的所謂「才女」</p>
<p>據說我國古代有所謂「才女」，華卓絕智力過人，往往體質羸弱，身世坎坷，一生飄零</p>
<p>遇人不淑，或則年不及中年而天社會上那些號稱「鴻儒」之輩，便說她們因爲人太聰明了才華過於超絕，未免德澤太薄。拿近世生理學家心理學家的論斷來說，眞正的天才並不屬於她們　天才應該在各方面都是優越的，身心都同樣發展到最高地步。還有，以部分看全體，也是錯誤的。由少數的「才女」身世之不幸遽定「無才便是德」的結論，和「自古紅顏多薄命」一類話，同樣不合邏輯。再有，智力高，才學富，容易走上品格不健全的路，那尤其是謬見，我不能吾認有少數知識程度和適中力較高的女性，或不免行為失檢，然而這只能視為偶然，不足為「女子無才便是德」的例證。事實上作這種例證的人便不啻承認「女子有才便無德」。但在另一方面，我不能否認，知識程度和智力較高的女性，生活理想一定要比一般的女性爲高，思想也一定要比一般的女性爲進步對於家庭和社會的貢獻，一定要比一般的女性為大。</p>
<p>動機決定行為價值</p>
<p>而且現代倫理學家一致承認，道德行爲標準的高低，最主要的還是要看造成行爲的「動機」而定。同樣良好的行爲，還須視行爲的「動機」的好壞，而決定行爲的價値。這就是說，有許多人的行爲所表現的結果也許是很好的，但「動機」不一定都很好。要使得我們的「動機」好，那全是「知」的問題。無知之人縱有善良的行爲，只能算是偶然的。盲目的，不是自覺的，有目的的</p>
<p>現代國民所需要的道德行爲，自然應該是完全自覺的，有目的的：了解這種事為什麼一定要如此做。忠勇的行爲是好的，但</p>
<p>忠勇的意義何在　那就不是愚味無知的人所能理解的了。能夠有良好的行爲表現出來固然很好，如「動機」也很好，那不是更好嗎嗎？</p>
<p>無論從那方面，我所提出的「女子有才便是德」是有社會學和心理學的根據的。我希望社會人士對女子教育的看法，應該不遠背社會的進化和時代的要求，重新衡量首先之社會的心理的標準。一方面我更熱忱地希望女子自身要起來要求：普及女子受敎育的機會，提高女子知議技能的水凖，從澈底的自覺中，爭取獨立的人格，以達到男女政洽上經濟上眞正的平等！</p>
<h3>家庭格言</h3>
<p>— 文荃錄</p>
<p>動者生動之氣，儉者收斂之氣，有此二字，家運斷無不興之理。</p>
<p>家和則福自生，若一家之中，兄有言，弟無不從，弟有請，兄無不應，和氣蒸蒸，而家不興者，未之有也。反是而不敗者，亦未之有也。</p>
<p>兄弟和，雖窮氓小戶必興；兄弟不和，雖世家宦族必敗。</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>三八節的廢話</h3>
<p>— 張宛育</p>
<p>今天又逢到三八節了，很想說點冠冕漂亮的話，可是說不出來，想了牛天，只能說幾句「話」。</p>
<p>誰都知這三八節是替婦女出氣的日子。到了這天，婦女們無論做到做不到的，必定開會一次，演說一次，遊行一次來紀念它。每年如此，即以中國來說，也有廿幾次了。</p>
<p>到了這大，有智織的人站在台上高呼，沒有智識的人跟在後面狂喊，忙了一天，一覺醒來，頭一天的事全都忘了，照樣有智識的婦女和丈夫鬧意見，受心理上的虐待；沒有智識的婦女議丈夫毒打，受生理上的虐待，爲什嗎？經濟不能獨立是一大原因。</p>
<p>有了錢的女人一定有好日子過嗎？也不一定，至少不至於爲了要些菜錢而被亂駡一頓，或是多國點米麵而被　爲要　私房。</p>
<p>婦女們永遠不認淸自己的地位，該做什麼，要做什麼，就永遠也沒有好日子過。抄小道走近路，拍男人的馬屁，結果，被送了個「花瓶」。　有智識的婦女不見到比沒智識的婦女偉大，有人格。鄕下女人除了本位的生兒育女外，耕地，刈草，挑水，推磨，那一樣也不會輸於男人。中國之所以能交足於地球上，是靠了百分之七八十農人的力量的，而農人，在工作上面，婦女和男子是平等的，所以農婦並不丟臉。</p>
<p>反過來看，有智識的婦女如何？參政的在互相爭權，講文化的在互相排擠，辦實業的在互相傾軋；只往雲彩影兒裏着，很少肯眞心往勞苦大衆的婦女身上着想的；只顧自己佔便宜，出風頭。</p>
<p>文章而不會寫，衣服而不會縫，菜不會燒，飯不會作，小孩子領不了，學生書敎不了，鋤頭拿不動，地也不能掃一把，光坐了男人給預備的汽車或三輪車去「婦女運動」，那才眞叫笑話呢。</p>
<p>所以呀，叫男子們看不起，擠出來，是自找的。婦女們別掩着鼻子嗚嗚的哭呀，埋頭苦幹才有用呢。聽？我這是篇廢話，你愛聽不愛聽？</p>
<p>婚姻</p>
<h3>代行結婚</h3>
<p>— 宓惟良</p>
<p>——結婚次數最多的男人</p>
<p>在美國該撤斯州（Kansas）該撤斯地（Kansas　City）的法庭中,站着一位身材甚高的中年男人,戴着一副眼鏡,在他的身旁，有一位年輕美貌的女郞，他們攙着手，原來他們正在進行結婚的禮節，當儀式完成之時，道位中年人輕拍着女的背，同時並吻着她的額角。</p>
<p>新郞向法官說:「多謝,勞神.」同時交給法官，一張五塊美金的票據.</p>
<p>此次是你的第三十八次，還是三十九次的結婚?」法官問他</p>
<p>「第三十九次的結婚。」中年人回答說。</p>
<p>這位中年人是呌做湯姆斯，斐納根（Thomas　.Finnegan）。他雖然已結了三十九次的婚，但是他從未離婚過，他的太太亦未曾去世，而他每次的結婚，都是合法的。</p>
<p>原來在一九四三年的二月，他接到一位各呌白郞的小姐的信，意思說：在蘇必略湖附近有一位小姐和一位水手熱戀着，當他們正在準備結婚的時候，這位水手忽接到命令，需要立即開往海外，但是他們仍希望設法結婚。於是有一位芝加哥的律師，向白郞小姐建議說：他曾聽見該撤斯州有代行結婚（Proky-marriage）的法律。所以白郞小姐詢問斐納根是否知這此事。」</p>
<p>斐納根讀畢此信後，就去翻法律書，知道確有某事，他並請了一位當地的法官爲證婚人，同時寫信給白郞小姐說：若是這位小姐願意到該撤斯城來舉行代行結婚儀式的話，他也頗願意代表她的丈夫，在結婚禮節中做一位新郞。過了數星期他們就舉行結婚。</p>
<p>後來，他代表一位陸軍士兵，在敎堂中，和一位芝加哥小姐訂婚。此後數月中，他平均每星期有二次的結婚。在日本投降日前，他已將三十個婚禮的日期排定好，當時向他申請舉行此種婚禮的有六十起以上。</p>
<p>大多數和他結婚的太太，婚後常常寫信給他，吿訴她們婚後的生活如何，多數是很美滿的。但是也有一位太太却要求斐納根代表她的丈夫，到法庭中去進行離婚手續，他於是寫信給她，請她說明離婚的理由，並希望她對此事愼重考慮，不作輕舉妄動，同時他也寫信給她的丈夫，吿訴他在此案中他所處的地位和情况，總之，斐納根很希望他們能言歸於好。</p>
<p>當此次戰事結東前，他接到三位服務人員的信，說他們想結婚，但是他們的情人為國家服務而遠在海外，所以他也準備一用他自己的太太。</p>
<p>斐納根的職業是律師，但他並不想在代行結婚的事各國，想賺錢致富，所以他每次結婚僅取費美金十五元，律師因為美國只有該撒斯有此法律：人民可以代行結婚而合法，所以有許多女郎不遠千里而來，有的由西來自落　山，有的自東部考羅納而來。由斐納根代表她們的情人，在結婚儀式中做一個新郎，代表這些這些在海外的水手和兵士立誓。多數女士對於斐納根有極好的印象：覺得他不但伶俐和聰明，而且懂得人情世故和人們的心理。</p>
<p>至於斐納根自己的太太，對於他在代行結婚中做個新郎並無醋意，有一次她對人說：「我對斐納根不論結婚多少次，皆不放在心上，因他並不和這些女孩子去渡密月啊！」</p>
<p>佈置</p>
<h3>佈置居室十原則</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>戰後世界普遍地鬧着屋荒，中國亦不能例外，而尤以上海爲甚。復員以來，後方的人粉紛望上海跑，要是你亦有親戚或朋友初自內地回來，一時找不到房十，經濟又不容許他常住旅館，你能不設法讓一兩間空屋子給他們嗎？這時候，重行佈置房間是亟需的。房間佈置的得法，有時候可彌補不少的缺憾，使精神上愉快許多。所謂『室雅無須大』啊！</p>
<p>下面幾點，可供參考。</p>
<p>（一）如非必要，勿將桌子椅子等放在室中央，因爲這使走來走去的人不便。</p>
<p>（二）櫉及梳粧檯等，有人每喜斜放，這很佔地位，並且觀感上亦較靠牆正放不舒服得多。</p>
<p>（三）高的傢具不要放近窗口，或甚至遮去窗口，這樣會妨碍光源，使精神上不暢快。</p>
<p>（四）笨大的東西要放在較大的房間內，如放在小屋子內，會使你感到窒悶。</p>
<p>（五）牛床較掛帳的床在觀感上要舒服得多。</p>
<p>（六）牆壁粉刷，以淺色及寒性顏色如荷色淡藍等較有寬暢的感覺。</p>
<p>（七）如窗戶太小，宜在窗戶兩旁各一二尺的地位，掛上一幅假設的帘布，以彌補缺憾。</p>
<p>（八）室內在適當的地方，安放一二瓶鮮花，或金魚之類，可以使精神安適得多。</p>
<p>（九）燈一定要高掛，在室中央，裝置過低，或牽懸在室隅床上，桌上，均非所宜。</p>
<p>（十）非必要的東西應儘量收藏，不要任意堆置室隅或桌上，不但不好看，並且收拾房間的時候很麻煩。</p>
<p>玩具</p>
<h3>小布娃娃</h3>
<p>— 盧淑芳</p>
<p>這是一個很容易做的小玩藝，用來當小禮物哄哄孩子或是放在針綫筐內做爲挿針包也可以。</p>
<p>材料：任何零頭碎布，只要顏色鮮艷的（如用絲絨製更爲美觀），一小塊下過水的白布（做臉面用——，棉花或碎布渣一團。</p>
<p>製法：依國將布塊大小剪下，照綫點先將身體與身底縫合起來，成一圓筒形，內裝碎布或棉花，再將臉面照綫點縫合，內裝棉花（臉面露出之一方宜平整），將下端縫紮，再將尖頂帽縫戴頭上，與身體聯和縫緊，兩臂兩腿亦縫合裝入棉花。安置妥當，即成一有趣小布娃娃。再將手脚縫束成形，繪上臉面，頸項繫上絲帶，最後於帽端處繫一絲繩即成，可按圖中此例加以放大或縮小。</p>

        <h1>1946 - n67</h1>
<h3>Marshall and Wedemeyer Confer, Discussions Focused on the Northeast Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Chongqing, 7th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, after inspecting various regions where conflicts have occurred between the former Nationalist and Communist armies, consulted with General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater. It is widely believed that the discussions between Marshall and Wedemeyer focused on the situation in the Northeast and the issue of merging the Nationalist and Communist armies. General Wedemeyer is residing at General Marshall's residence in Chongqing during this visit.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, paid visits to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek twice last night and today for consultations. He also visited Special Envoy Marshall for discussions. It is understood that the discussions pertain to issues such as the transportation of Nationalist troops to the Northeast and the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Chongqing, 6th] U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall, government representative Zhang Zhizhong, and Communist representative Zhou Enlai have returned to Chongqing on the 6th after a week-long tour of various regions in China where military conflicts are still occurring. The three leaders briefly visited Beijing, Jinan, Xuzhou, Taiyuan, Yan'an, and Hankou, urging the local Nationalist and Communist commanders to guarantee the maintenance of peace. According to accompanying reporters, Special Envoy Marshall made resolute remarks in several venues, stating that the next two months would be the most crucial period for China's future destiny.</p>
<p>[United Press International, this city, 7th] The publication of the U.S. note to China and the Soviet Union regarding the Soviet army's removal of "war booty" from the Northeast will reveal the "Northeast problem". General Marshall may be invited to explore solutions to the current crisis. As President Truman's special envoy with ambassadorial rank, Marshall has the authority to look after all U.S. interests in China, including the Northeast. At the invitation of the Chinese government, Marshall is serving as chairman of the three-person committee, and the Military Mediation Execution Headquarters in Beiping has the authority to act in the Northeast, namely, to send field inspection teams to prevent conflicts, designate areas to be received by the Nationalist and Communist armies, and reorganize local Nationalist and Communist troops. As an ambassador, he also has the authority to send U.S. representatives to the Northeast, especially to look after U.S. commercial and other interests in various parts of the Northeast. The Soviet Union's refusal to allow U.S.-China joint field inspection teams and U.S. officials to enter the Northeast may create a serious international crisis. The Chinese government is adopting an official attitude of silence on this matter in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of a "formal crisis." If General Marshall is invited to handle the Northeast problem, he will face a far more difficult and delicate task than mediating the Chinese civil war or reorganizing and unifying the Chinese army. Soviet participation in the field inspection committee talks seems possible, as this move could alleviate Soviet concerns about U.S. activities in China.</p>
<h3>Haiphong Military Conflict Incident, Responsibility Under Investigation, French Chargé d'Affaires Visits Director Wu of the Foreign Ministry for Discussion</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 7th] Since the conflict occurred on the evening of the 5th between Chinese and French troops over the French military's forced landing in Haiphong, newspapers in Chongqing on the 6th prominently published this news. Diplomatic personnel from both China and France are also paying close attention to this matter. At 11:30 a.m. on the 6th, French Chargé d'Affaires Thierry visited Wu Nanru, Director of the European Department of the Foreign Ministry, to discuss the matter. It is reported that the cause of the conflict was that the French warships rushed north from Saigon to Haiphong ahead of schedule, while our garrison had not yet received the order to take over defense. Negotiations between the two sides were unsuccessful for a time, leading to the exchange of fire. The responsibility is currently under investigation. The Foreign Ministry has decided to send Secretary Ling Qihan, our representative in Vietnam, to fly to Shanghai and then to Haiphong on the morning of the 8th to handle the negotiations regarding this unfortunate incident in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 7th stated: As a result of the conflict between Chinese and French troops in the Haiphong area, the French side suffered 18 deaths and over 40 injuries.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Saigon, 7th] French authorities announced: Yesterday, a French fleet carrying 20,000 troops arrived outside the port of Haiphong, preparing to land and take over defense. They were bombarded by the Chinese occupying forces. At least ten French soldiers were killed, and the French light cruiser "Victory" was hit by four shells and suffered significant damage. In addition, two landing craft were hit and caught fire. According to unconfirmed reports, French troops landed at dawn today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Ling Qihan, Special Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry in Vietnam, is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 8th and then to Vietnam to handle the unfinished matters of the Chinese government's advisory group stationed in Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 7th] Lu Han arrived here by special plane from Chongqing on the afternoon of the 7th.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 7th] Today, the French Colonial Ministry and the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense issued a joint statement saying: The French Navy, attempting to land in Haiphong, suffered considerable damage under the intense artillery fire of the Chinese troops. The statement continued: "After the representatives of the Chinese and French governments signed a diplomatic agreement in Chongqing on February 26, our troops immediately approached Haiphong on March 6 with the aim of relieving the Chinese troops stationed in Tokyo. Although contact was made with the Chinese army headquarters in Hanoi and guarantees were obtained, our ships were still subjected to artillery bombardment and there was no response from the other side for more than half an hour. Only after suffering some damage under the intense artillery fire were our ships ordered to return fire. The French military command has made contact with the Chinese military command, and negotiations are now underway between the two commands."</p>
<h3>Restoration of the Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Scheduled to Begin Tomorrow, Jinan-Qingdao Railway Still Faces Unresolved Issues</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] Reliable sources indicate that railway repair materials are all ready, and engineering personnel have been dispatched in batches to the damaged areas. The northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, from Liguo to Xuzhou, is scheduled to begin construction on March 9. If there are no other accidents, it can usually be repaired within two months. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway, from Damiao to Baitabu, may begin construction at the same time as the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The extent of damage in this section is lighter, and it can be repaired in one month.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] According to sources in the transportation industry, the long-delayed railway restoration project has encountered some intractable problems due to the Communist army's unauthorized appointment of a director of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration. It is reported that a similar situation has occurred on the Jinan-Qingdao Railway. It is also rumored that the director of the Jinan-Qingdao Railway Administration appointed by the Communist army is preparing to establish a training class for transportation workers in Zibo and has hired more than ten Japanese transportation technicians to serve as instructors.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] The fare for the Puxu section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been adjusted again, starting on March 7, to 1.5 yuan per kilometer, an increase of 50% over the original fare.</p>

(2) Our party has consistently advocated that the interests of the nation and the people are higher than the interests of the party. If the Political Consultative Conference can achieve unified peace and national construction, then the concessions made by our party are also the success of our party. (3) After our party opens up political power, it is hoped that all parties will not insist on party interests being higher than everything else and should prioritize the nation and the people. In particular, it is hoped that the Communist Party will abandon its separatist regime and achieve the unification of government orders. (4) The nationalization of the military and the unified military order of the military reorganization plan must be implemented immediately. In particular, it is hoped that the Communist Party will abandon its ambition to seize power by force. (5) If parties adhere to the Three Principles of the People and affirm Chairman Chiang's leadership in national construction, especially the Communist Party's repeated declarations to strive for the thorough realization of the Three Principles of the People, they must prove it with facts, should not distort the principles, and should not use various issues to restrain the leader. (6) The five-power constitution is the legacy of the Founding Father and cannot be changed arbitrarily. The "Principles for Amending the Constitution Draft" must be corrected. (7) In view of the shortcomings of the three-branch separation system and the malpractices of the multi-party cabinet system, our country should adopt a five-yuan system and a presidential system in the future. (8) The National Assembly should exert the spirit of democracy and should not restrict its power. (9) There are a large number of ethnic minorities in the border areas. In the future, representatives of the National Assembly and members of the National Government should pay attention to their distribution quotas. Later, Sun Ke, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Shao Lizi gave supplementary explanations on the agreed matters of the Political Consultative Conference. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 p.m.</p>

It has been decided that the municipal government, China Farmers Bank, China Industrial and Agricultural Bank, Shanghai Bank, the Shanghai branch of the National Cooperative Office, and various cooperatives in the city will launch a one-time full subscription, totaling 100 million yuan in national currency. The subscription period will run from now until March 20, and the China Farmers Bank, China Industrial and Agricultural Bank, and Municipal Bank will collect the funds on behalf of the Treasury. It is expected that the Treasury can be established in April.</p>
<p>A cooperative treasury is a type of cooperative, a cooperative federation formed by many cooperative organizations. Its purpose is to regulate the capital of cooperative enterprises. Strictly speaking, according to the regulations of the cooperative treasury, its members (usually meaning shareholders) are cooperatives, and its customers are also cooperatives, not individuals. In terms of the task of the cooperative treasury, it is very similar to a central bank; the central bank is the bank of banks, and the cooperative treasury is the cooperative of cooperatives. Simply put, it is a cooperative financial institution jointly owned by many cooperatives, with the purpose of regulating the finances of various cooperatives.</p>
<p>A cooperative treasury is also a legal person, and its responsibilities are of two types: (1) limited liability and (2) guaranteed liability. In a limited liability cooperative treasury, the liability of its members (not individuals) for the treasury is limited to the amount of capital they have subscribed, just like the liability of shareholders in a limited company. In a guaranteed liability cooperative treasury, the liability of the members for the treasury is limited to a certain multiple of the amount of capital they have subscribed. In the United Kingdom, it is a guaranteed limited company. As for the multiple to be added, there are no mandatory regulations, and it can be determined by each treasury itself in its charter. Of course, the minimum is one time. The so-called "one time" (i.e., doubling) means that if one subscribes to one million yuan in national currency, one must bear a liability of two million yuan. Cooperative treasuries can be divided into four types:</p>
<p>(1) Central Cooperative Treasury, supervised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Customer status: Provincial and municipal cooperative treasuries under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, as well as cooperative federations with national scope.</p>
<p>A. Provincial cooperative treasury, supervised by: the cooperative authorities above the provincial level; customer status: county and municipal cooperative treasuries and cooperative federations with provincial scope.</p>
<p>(2) B. Municipal cooperative treasury under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, supervised by: the cooperative authorities above the municipal level under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan. Customer status: credit cooperatives and various cooperative federations in the region.</p>
<p>(3) County and municipal cooperative treasuries, supervised by: cooperative authorities above the county and municipal levels. Customer status: credit cooperatives and various cooperative federations in the region.</p>
<p>(4) In areas below the county and municipal levels, cooperative treasury agencies may be established if necessary, and their tasks may be exercised by local credit cooperatives or credit cooperative federations.</p>
<p>Since cooperative treasuries are divided into four types, their sources of funds are also different: (1) The central cooperative treasury is jointly subscribed and organized by provincial and municipal cooperative treasuries under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, as well as cooperative federations with national scope. (2) The provincial cooperative treasury is jointly subscribed and organized by county and municipal cooperative treasuries and cooperative federations with provincial scope. (3) The municipal cooperative treasury under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan and the county and municipal cooperative treasuries are jointly subscribed and organized by credit cooperatives and various cooperative federations in each region. The cooperative movement in the world has a long history, but the cooperative movement in our country has only been spontaneously launched for less than 30 years. Consumer cooperation and production cooperation are still in the promotion period, and cooperative treasuries are still in the pilot period. The entire cooperative organization system and administrative supervision are not very strict and clear. Therefore, in order to promote the establishment of cooperative treasuries, governments at all levels, Farmers Banks, local banks, and other private banks that handle agricultural loans, as well as other legal entities that do not aim to make profits, are allowed to subscribe to equity capital to facilitate their establishment. There were many cooperative treasuries established with the assistance of the China Farmers Bank in the rear area during the Anti-Japanese War. According to the bank's report in 1940, more than 200 counties had been established, providing funds of more than 38 million yuan in national currency (see my article "Rural Financial Institutions in China During Wartime" published in the 50th issue of the China-US Weekly in September 1940). The Shanghai Cooperative Treasury, which is still in preparation, is also of this nature.</p>
<p>The "Cooperative Treasury Regulations" promulgated by the National Government previously had minimum requirements for the total capital of cooperative treasuries. The total capital of the central cooperative treasury should be at least 10 million yuan in national currency, the provincial cooperative treasury and the municipal cooperative treasury under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan should be at least 1 million yuan in national currency, and the county and municipal cooperative treasury should be at least 100,000 yuan in national currency. This minimum amount is obviously not suitable for the current situation. Increases and decreases in the capital of cooperative treasuries must be approved by the representative assembly and reported to the competent authorities for approval before they become effective.</p>
<p>According to the regulations, the organization of a cooperative treasury is:</p>
<p>Representative Assembly — Board of Directors — Board of Supervisors — Manager — Deputy Manager — Assistant Manager — (may be established if necessary).</p>
<p>A cooperative treasury is a cooperative financial institution, so its business is of course similar to that of a bank, and it handles deposits, loans, remittances, and other agency payments. In addition to operating these businesses, the operating funds of the cooperative treasury must not be used for investment in any other business. This is clearly stipulated in the regulations.</p>
<p>Since the cooperative treasury is aimed at cooperatives and its purpose is to regulate the finances of cooperatives, its mission, as mentioned earlier, is very similar to that of a central bank. The cooperative business in our country has not yet been developed, and the strength of cooperatives is neither universal nor very large. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, there was chaos everywhere, and the economic and financial resources of farmers were almost completely destroyed. It is really not an easy task to establish a universal cooperative network in the vast recovered areas. Even if there are cooperatives, their resources will not be strong, so financial assistance from cooperative treasuries is urgently needed. We hope that the Shanghai Cooperative Treasury will be established quickly to help nearby cooperatives become increasingly developed and sound. With prices going crazy like this, the cooperative movement is really an army of salvation.</p>
<p>Cooperatives need cooperative treasuries, and similarly, cooperative treasuries must also have cooperatives so that their funds can have an outlet and be used effectively. This is truly a "win-win situation." At present, with prices going crazy like this, the weakness of rural finance is really the most serious problem. More than 79% of the people in our country are farmers. If farmers have weak purchasing power, no guarantee of livelihood, economic recovery cannot be discussed, economic construction cannot be discussed, and national industrialization is just a dream. To save the countryside and prevent bankruptcy, in addition to large-scale agricultural loans, the universal cooperative business is indeed a good way, so is a strong cooperative treasury not a very important thing?</p>

<p>Distribution of Subsidized Flour by the Branch Office</p>
<p>Commodity prices in Hangzhou have continued to rise recently. After a sharp drop in gold prices, the quoted price today is 16,200 yuan (per qian). After the rice shops were vandalized by the public, the government has set a maximum rice price of 23,000 yuan. However, many rice shops are still using various excuses to delay reopening or are selling inferior rice, causing considerable public anxiety. It is reported that black market rice prices in the Chengzhan and Qingtai Road areas have reached over 30,000 yuan. Fortunately, the Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office has recently distributed a batch of flour in Hangzhou, using the provincial Cooperative Marketing Office and 15 rice shops as subsidized price units. The price is set at 6,000 yuan per bag (including the sack), with a limit of five bags per person, and 140 yuan per jin. All citizens can purchase it. It is reported that the head office still has 100,000 bags of flour, which will be transported to Hangzhou soon to provide assistance. It is expected that grain prices in Hangzhou may gradually stabilize in the near future.</p>

<p>Soaring Grain Prices Lead to Rice Shop Vandalism</p>
<p>Grain prices in this port have been rising daily since the beginning of spring. After discussions between the county government and relevant trade associations, it was decided to sell rice at 11.5 jin per thousand yuan. Yesterday morning, the Yeh Yanqing Rice Shop on Ma Hang and Seng Street suddenly posted a price of 8 jin per thousand yuan, causing a dispute. Rice factories in the Shuangmen and Shuitoumen areas did not sell a single grain of rice. The common people, unable to obtain food, became panicked, leading to a wave of unrest. Rice factories in areas such as Dananmen and Xiaonanmen were vandalized, and large quantities of rice were dumped into the river. Groups of people marched in the streets, and shops throughout the city closed down. The situation only quieted down after the Security Headquarters announced martial law.</p>

<h3>Improving Road System for Traffic Convenience, Jielu Road to be Widened First, Construction Decided to Start This Month, Part of Zhejiang Road to be Modified into Arcades</h3>
<p>The width of Jielu Road varies. In order to improve the city's appearance, improve the road system, and facilitate traffic, the municipal authorities will first widen the important Jielu Road leading to the North Railway Station. The railway authorities will voluntarily concede 5 meters of roadbed, widening the road to 35 meters. The Public Works Bureau has decided to start construction this month.</p>
<p>Lower Levels to be Demolished for Sidewalks</p>
<p>After the widening of Jielu Road starts, the width of Zhejiang Road, which directly connects to the North Railway Station, will be widened to 20 meters. However, due to the prosperity and dense population of Zhejiang Road, it has been decided to start construction on the South and North sections of Zhejiang Road first, and then proceed with the middle section after the construction of the two sections is completed. All steel-reinforced concrete buildings will have their lower levels demolished and rebuilt into arcades for pedestrian passage, following the construction of houses on Gongguan Road. Furthermore, the Public Works Bureau is also planning to widen the roads of North Xizang Road and Xinmin Road. This plan has been submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<p>Illegal Buildings to be Gradually Removed</p>
<p>Regarding the entire road system, according to reliable sources, the Public Works Bureau will first start reorganizing the Xuhui and Nanshi areas. In the Xuhui area, where roads were illegally built beyond the concession boundaries, illegal buildings that do not comply with the road system stipulated by the pre-war municipal government will be gradually removed. The entire road system of the city will be announced after the master plan of the urban planning committee is completed, so as not to conflict with the urban planning master plan.</p>
<p>Nanshi and Zhabei to be Reorganized First</p>
<p>Nanshi and Zhabei districts have suffered severe damage. The Public Works and Land Administration Bureaus are currently jointly handling land registration and road reorganization, making adjustments based on actual needs and the well-being of citizens. Therefore, before the Public Works Bureau completes and announces the road system map, it will not issue formal construction permits for construction requests in areas outside the Huangpu District, but will issue temporary permits. This is because if the road system is changed, the building will have to be demolished accordingly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Management Office Reports on Work Overview</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Japanese Nationals Management Office of the Third Front Army held a reception for reporters in the auditorium yesterday to report on the overview of its work. Commander Tang presided over the meeting. First, Director Wang Guanghan stated that, up to recently, 1,196,817 Japanese nationals and prisoners of war have been repatriated. About 120,000 people remain in the Shanghai area. The retention of Japanese technical personnel requires approval from the Ministry of Military Affairs. Currently, more than 3,000 people have registered. These technical personnel can be divided into two categories: (1) those originally retained by various agencies, and (2) those requisitioned by receiving agencies due to needs. Subsequently, Deputy Director Zou Renzhi explained the "horror hut" incident to the outside world. At this time, Commander Enbo arrived and reported on the process of accepting the surrender and the tasks of the Japanese Nationals Management Office. He also stated that his visit to Shanghai was ordered to establish a military tribunal in Shanghai specifically for the trial of Japanese war criminals. It will be composed of military judges and High Court personnel from the department. The court will be located within the Shanghai Command Post of the department. He hoped that the people who had suffered from the atrocities of the Japanese army would report them as soon as possible so that they could be tried according to law.</p>

<h3>Nine Department Stores Announce Automatic Closure, Refusing to Concede to Labor Demands Anymore, Four Thousand Employees Petitioned Collectively Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the labor dispute occurred on the 23rd of last month, the nine major department stores, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, China National Products, Sun Wah, Yue Hsin, Chung Hwa, and Lilian, have been in turmoil for almost a month. Although the Social Affairs Bureau has mediated five times, a compromise has not been reached due to the base salary issue, so it has not been resolved. From 3 PM to 5 PM the day before yesterday, employees of various companies staged a demonstration by going on strike for two hours, urging the management to make concessions. After joint discussions, the management of the nine companies also took a unified action and announced the automatic closure of the stores starting at 9:15 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Holding Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>More than 3,000 employees immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to submit a request to the relevant authorities, ordering the management to resume business immediately, and to hold a collective march of 4,000 people at 2 PM to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding that the Bureau handle the matter fairly. They believed that the management's automatic closure was an illegal action and requested sanctions. According to a labor representative who spoke to the reporter, the management of the Sun Sun and Wing On companies once expressed their acceptance of the labor's demands. However, after the successful organization of a joint organization by the management of the nine companies, they no longer made concessions to the labor and adopted a tough attitude, even at the expense of declaring liquidation and dismissing some employees. It was also stated that the labor's demand for a base salary was originally 79 yuan, but after repeated concessions, it was reduced to 69 yuan, but the management only agreed to 40 yuan and insisted on not increasing it.</p>
<p>Ruling Sent Out</p>
<p>Because the mediation could not be established, the Social Affairs Bureau sent a decision to both parties yesterday morning, stipulating that the base salary for clerks should be 60 yuan, assistant clerks 50 yuan, and trainees 45 yuan, with adjustments made at any time according to the current month's cost of living index. However, because the management suddenly announced the automatic closure, the situation became more confusing. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the management urging them to resume business, and the relevant authorities are also closely monitoring its development.</p>
<p>In addition, representatives of employees from the nine major department stores in this city are scheduled to receive reporters from various newspapers at 1:30 PM today (the 8th) at the China National Products Company's Fellows Association on the third floor of the Quanggong Building at No. 334 Nanjing Road to explain the details of the incident.</p>
<h3>Representatives Not Released, Tram Won't Operate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] More than 500 employees of the British Tramway Company gathered at the head office on Hardoon Road at around 9 AM yesterday and marched to the Social Affairs Bureau on Avenue Joffre to petition, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to assist in securing the release of the arrested representatives Zhang Xuekui and two others. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau sent a member to accompany two representatives to negotiate with the Garrison Headquarters, but the Garrison Headquarters stated that the three workers were suspected of treason, and whether they were guilty or not must be investigated and tried by the court, and they could not be released casually. The workers stated that if the representatives were not released for one day, they would not sell tickets or drive the trams for one day. Yesterday, all tram and trolleybus lines of the British company were suspended, and rickshaws and pedicabs profited threefold. Citizens felt very inconvenienced.</p>

<h3>After the Bank of China Allows Forward Foreign Exchange Settlements, Fluctuations Occur in the Financial Market</h3>
<p>Nearly 100 Applicants for Type A Operating Firms</p>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market in this city fluctuated again, with both gold and US dollars rising. It is rumored that the reason for the fluctuation was due to the Central Bank's release of forward exchange rates for April, May, and June, which were higher than the spot rates. However, the Central Bank authorities solemnly denied this, saying that the US exchange rate announced by the Central Bank yesterday was still 2020 yuan, and remained unchanged throughout the day. However, because the import period of foreign goods ordered by importers cannot be predetermined, the Central Bank specially allowed forward settlements for the months of April, May, and June to facilitate merchants' import business. The exchange rate for the spot market is still 2020 yuan. From now until April 7, it is 2120 yuan, until May 7, it is 2220 yuan, and until June 7, it is 2330 yuan. The reason why the exchange rate is higher than the spot rate is because interest is added. Currently, the black market interest rate is too high, exceeding 20%, while the interest rate set by the Bank of China this time is less than 5%. In addition, the Foreign Exchange Examination Office has received a total of 95 applications for Type A operating firms. By day, there were 13 on the first day, 38 on the second day, 33 on the third day, and 11 on the fourth day. There were also 15 cases of brokers dealing in foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Free Movie Screenings for Laborers</h3>

<h3>Unauthorized Driving Causes Accident</h3>
<p>At about 4 PM yesterday, Xu Yuqing, an apprentice from the Central Xinglong Automobile Company at No. 36 Wuzhen Road, Zhabei, privately drove out a repaired 2022 car. He drove about 20 yards westward and reached the corner of Xinjiang Road when he suddenly drove onto the sidewalk on the right, knocking down Li Fuwen, who suffered broken ribs. A woman, Chen Lu, was injured in the abdomen and suffered scratches to her hands and face. Later, the police station sent the injured to the hospital, and Xu Yuqing was detained by the police station for interrogation.</p>

At 6 PM, the Shanghai Women's Association will hold a banquet for the women's community at the Municipal Party Headquarters auditorium. The March 8th Commemoration Preparatory Committee also issued a March 8th Declaration, the main points of which are: "We are not talking about women's liberation now, we are just doing it practically; women's liberation is already the demand of the times and will inevitably be successful, and no one has the power to stop it. From now on, we must use a more heroic attitude and a more practical style to shoulder the responsibilities given to us by the nation and the state, and to shoulder the responsibilities given to us by the times."</p>
<h3>News Censorship in This City Canceled</h3>
<p>The municipal government received a telegram from the Central Propaganda Department yesterday stating that news censorship in the recovered areas would be canceled from the date of the telegram. The news censorship agency in this city was originally named the Jiangsu News Censorship Office, under the wartime News Censorship Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission. Last November, the central government stipulated that news censorship business should be handled by local governments. The news censorship agency in this city was transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Government on December 1st of last year and renamed the Shanghai Temporary News Censorship Office. The office stopped censorship immediately after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Heard the Verdict, Looked Depressed, Japanese War Criminal Ishihara Isamu Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Life Imprisonment and Forced Labor</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Ishihara Isamu, 36 years old, a former translator at the Japanese Jiangwan and Wusong concentration camps, was sentenced yesterday at 3 PM in the Tilanqiao Prison after four trials by the US Military Tribunal. Before the court session, Ishihara Isamu's attitude was natural, with a smile on his face. Although smoking was prohibited in the courtroom, Ishihara Isamu was an exception. After the judge and the defendant's defense counsel were seated, Judge Middleton ordered Ishihara Isamu to step forward to hear the verdict. He declared that Ishihara Isamu was accused of seven major crimes, which were all found guilty by the court's vote. It was also decided by a two-thirds secret vote to sentence him to life imprisonment and forced labor for life, and the place of imprisonment would be determined by the competent authorities. After hearing the verdict, Ishihara Isamu's expression suddenly became serious and tense. However, when he was escorted back by the military police, he was still smoking, trying to appear calm.</p>
<p>Portuguese Leimdys Quibbles and Denies the Charges</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Portuguese Leimdys (i.e. Leimidy) is a strong player in the Portuguese merchant football team in this port. Because his mother is Japanese, he changed his name to Nakamura Leimdys during the war. Relying on the enemy's power, he arbitrarily arrested Chinese people and, together with the Hungarian Sibok, purchased a large amount of gasoline, alcohol, and other military supplies for the enemy. After the victory, Leimidi Sibok and his Portuguese assistant Xue Erfa were arrested. The case was previously heard by the High Court once, and was continued yesterday by the judge. Yan Fuchang, a witness summoned to the court, testified to the suffering, saying that the defendant had ordered alcohol from me, but the payment was not cleared. He also wrote bad checks and then tried to recover the money that had already been paid, and detained me for 19 days. The defendant continued to quibble and deny the charges, and hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to defend him. The court ordered that the case be postponed for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Temporary Council to be Convened in a Short Period of Time</h3>
<p>Remarks by Vice-Chairman Xi Yushu</p>
<p>[Our Report] The reporter visited Xi Yushu, a senator and Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Temporary Council, yesterday and asked him whether it was possible that the convening of the Temporary Council would be stopped because it was rumored that formal senators would be elected at the end of April. Xi replied that the members of the Municipal Temporary Council had already been selected and announced by the government, but because the Municipal Government had not yet received a formal order, it was not yet preparing to convene the meeting. However, he believed that it would be convened in the shortest possible time, because the city urgently needed this public opinion organization and could not wait until the end of April. Moreover, the election procedures are very complicated, and it is questionable whether the senators can be elected on schedule. It can only find a transition method first.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The reporter visited a well-known financier yesterday and asked for his opinion on the Temporary Council. He said that he was not willing to make any comments on the Council before the Temporary Council was formally established. He only said that the Council was temporary in nature, so it was expected that the time the Council existed would not be too long. Regarding the issue of commodity prices, he said that the opening of the foreign exchange market had a very good general response and had achieved a stabilizing effect. He believed that the supply of materials would be smoother and prices would be easier to stabilize.</p>
<h3>To Revive Our Silk Industry, The First Batch of Mulberry Seedlings Arrived in Shanghai from Japan, 300,000 Centimeters of Silkworm Eggs Will Also Arrive</h3>
<p>In order to revive China's silk industry, the Executive Yuan, through the US Department of Agriculture and Forestry's representative in China, repeatedly discussed with General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo and allocated 1.8 million branches of Japanese mulberry seedlings to be transported to China for transplantation. This move has been approved by the headquarters, and the first batch of 800,000 branches arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and have been distributed by the China Silk Company to the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The remaining 1 million branches are also en route. In addition, 300,000 centimeters of Japanese silkworm eggs will also arrive within days. It is estimated that these 300,000 silkworm eggs can produce 24,000 dan of dry cocoons after incubation. After the above-mentioned mulberry seedlings and silkworm eggs arrive in Shanghai, the China Silk Company will work with the construction departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to distribute them according to the reported needs of various counties.</p>
<p>Requesting a Loan of 3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The China Silk Company has also requested various national banks to provide loans to silk merchants to purchase new cocoons when they are on the market to help revitalize the Chinese silk industry. According to the company's estimate, the amount of loans required at that time will reach 3 million yuan, and this estimate has been sent to various banks for preparation. The China Silk Company only stands in an advisory position in the banks. Silk merchants must pay 30% of the down payment and apply directly to the banks for loans. After the spring cocoons are on the market, it is expected that there will be 10,000 silk reeling machines in operation in the southeastern region.</p>
<h3>Telegrams to Chongqing, Tianjin, and Other Places Resumed as Usual</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, the labor strikes in Chongqing, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places have been resolved, and commercial telegrams between this port and these places have been resumed as usual.</p>
<h3>Brothers Fight, Bloodshed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhen Deju, a Tianjin native who works as a servant at the Swiss Consulate at No. 1469 Linsen West Road, is over forty years old.

Later, securities firms came to absorb it, and silver firms compensated for their chips. In the afternoon, the buying interest became more intense, and the market exceeded 1.6 million. At noon, it lingered around 1.65 million. In the afternoon, gold ornaments were priced higher and higher, and the exchange customers became even more panicked. The price rose to 1.76 million twice.

Gold ornaments rose from 168,000 to 190,000, and finally 180,000. Refined silver was 1,600, and silver dollars rose to 880 yuan for buying. The underground discount gradually stabilized, and the underground interest rate was from 1.7 to 2.2 jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign currency US dollar was extremely calm at first, struggling around the previous closing exchange rate for a long time. However, the gold market rose sharply, and the gap between the US dollar and gold was widening, causing arbitrage purchases, and gradually passively improving. In the afternoon, the arbitrage price against gold was widened to 800 yuan per ten taels or more, and then gradually rose to about 2,200 yuan.

<h3>Under the Sharp Rise in Gold Prices; Securities Continue to Advance</h3>

As a result, they rose by 170 yuan to 250 yuan compared with the previous close. As soon as the Chinese stocks opened, they inherited the good reputation of the afternoon of the previous day.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Transactions are Both Smooth; 20-Count Yarn is Particularly Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned prosperous again. Green gold notes all announced increases, arousing bullish sentiment. 20-count Double Horse opened at 1.02 million and rose to 1.09 million, and there were still buyers. The other counts of yarn all rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The Fangjian Company opened yarn and thread at noon, with both coarse and fine, but only 20-count was missing, so the demand for 20-count yarn in the market is indeed stable.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Starting today, Fangjian Company has revised the purchase application procedures. All factories wishing to apply to purchase yarn, cloth, and woolen fabrics must fill out a registration form on the same day, send it to the finished product section, and have it approved by the business director to complete the transaction. Pay the full amount before 3 PM the next afternoon to receive the warehouse receipt.</p>

There are also several hundred pieces of Brazilian cotton and seed cotton.</p>

<p>Due to the arrival of a large amount of Wenhong and Taiwan tea, the sellers automatically lowered the price, and it has fallen a lot in the past two days. However, due to cost considerations, they are currently unwilling to devalue it further, so the potential trend has turned stable, and the market has stopped falling. As for other varieties, the holders still sell as before, and there are ups and downs due to the uneven quality of the goods. As for the foreign companies, a certain tea company in this city has received a telegram from New York, and the demand for colorless round heads is very high, but the offered price has not been relaxed, so the current attitude of the local merchants is hesitant.</p>

<h3>The Rapid Advance of New Benchmarks and Institutions in British and American Social Services</h3>
<p>— Wang Keji</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Our Newspaper</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Wang Ke, arrived in the United States last August, traveling through New York and other places for a total of five months. On his return journey, he traveled from America to England, staying there for less than two months. He was urgently called back by telegram and then traveled through Continental Europe: France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Greece, Iran, India, and other countries. He finally returned to Chongqing in February of this year. This trip was commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs to investigate social service undertakings, with special emphasis on various aspects of community social service centers. This is the first report, which describes the current state of social service undertakings in Britain and America in a concise and essential manner, suitable for reference by all sectors of society—Editor.</p>
<p>Policy</p>
<p>Social service undertakings in Britain and America are purely based on the voluntary contribution of manpower and resources by the people. They complement national policies, assist the government in areas where it falls short, and enhance social welfare. This is their policy and their purpose. However, the terminology differs: in Britain, it is called social service; in America, it is called social work, and recently also social welfare or public welfare. The types of services increase or decrease depending on the time and circumstances, but Britain and America share many similarities, such as welfare for children, adult education, family welfare, labor welfare, assistance for the elderly, weak, and disabled, disaster relief, social insurance, vocational introduction and guidance, medical and health services, mental illness treatment, services for veterans and demobilized soldiers, youth services, rural services, housing and urban planning, consumer cooperation, assistance for travelers, entertainment, etc. Recent American history has focused on various services for domestic Black people and international services, the former to harmonize races, the latter to benefit the world. All of the above are within the scope of the government's existing or future policies and responsibilities. The people, out of benevolence, assist the government's policies through social service. Based on this argument, social service and political construction are closely related and promote the realization of ideal political construction.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>Most social service undertakings in Britain and America are non-governmental organizations. In recent years, a good social service ethos has developed in society, unlike in the past when only religious groups were involved. The organization of various social service groups is mostly divided into a board of directors and an executive department. Whether local or national, the board of directors is responsible for presiding over the organization, while the executive department is responsible for handling affairs. In order to promote the people's service ethos, the government respects these organizations and does not require registration, nor does it supervise or direct them. People in Britain and America believe that this undertaking is voluntary and do not want to be governed by the government, otherwise it would invisibly suppress its ethos. Because the British and American people have a strong sense of responsibility, the boards of directors earnestly manage affairs, and the government can trust them to do so. Therefore, there is no governing body at the local or central level in Britain and America. Although the government establishes or manages administrative agencies or undertakings for social welfare according to the needs of the people, such as the British and American labor departments and social insurance, vocational introduction, and other undertakings, the British Assistance Board, and the American local government welfare departments, these administrative agencies do not govern non-governmental organizations, but only coordinate and cooperate with them as a form of governance, and are not social service undertakings. Therefore, social service undertakings in Britain and America, whether in wartime or peacetime, have developed very rapidly due to their free development, evolving from a broad range of individual efforts to a close-knit cooperation with division of labor. There are social work and fundraising committees nationwide and in various localities in America, and social service committees nationwide and in various localities in Britain. These are joint organizations of social service undertakings, similar to the China Social Service Advancement Association, which aims to promote the division of labor and cooperation to improve work efficiency. For example, during the recent war, six organizations, including the National Catholic Community Service, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the Salvation Army, and the National Travelers Aid Association, jointly organized the United Service Organizations (USO) to concentrate manpower and resources to serve the front and rear, achieving remarkable results and earning a high reputation. They also held joint fundraising events. This is a good example of cooperation. Recently, the British National Council of Social Service is further expanding the strengthening and establishment of local social service committees. The above-mentioned group organizations are organized and systematic groups in British and American non-governmental social service organizations, and their achievements have become increasingly significant. The remaining groups are divided according to the type of service: one, a certain need arises only in a certain place and not elsewhere; two, a temporary need arises and dissolves after a certain period of time; three, there are several groups in various places with a national federation organization; four, various social service undertakings run by religious groups in various places have numerous names, which cannot be listed here one by one. The social service organizations in Britain and America that have a long history and are widespread in various places can be summarized as: (1) YMCA and YWCA; (2) Red Cross (the British and American Red Cross have services covering disaster relief, assistance, culture, transportation, family welfare, nutrition, entertainment, etc. Branches are widespread in various places in peacetime and extend to the military in wartime); (3) Boy Scouts; (4) Friendly Neighbors Association (called Residential Settlement in England and Settlement in America, which does not have a proper translation in the country yet, its content is to serve neighbors); (5) Women's Clubs. Of the above five organizations, the first three are well-known in our country, while the latter two are less known, but their history and achievements are equal to the YMCA and Red Cross. In summary, the YMCA, Red Cross, Friendly Neighbors Association, Women's Clubs, and other four organizations in Britain and America all rely on social service centers as their regular work focus. For example, the local branches of the YMCA and YWCA, the local friendly neighbor houses (Settlement House) of the Friendly Neighbors Association, and the Women's Clubs, except for the Boy Scouts, which provide a wide range of services, all use these types of central locations as the basis for carrying out various services. Recently, the British National Council of Social Service is launching rural service centers. In rural America, 4-H clubs are being launched. 4-H stands for Head (intelligence), Heart (morality), Hand (skills), and Health (body). It is for farmers and young people aged ten to twenty. There are already 1,700,000 members nationwide. This movement is promoted by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and has been effective in assisting the government in implementing policies in peacetime. There are also club locations. Therefore, social service undertakings in Britain and America have trended towards the social service center model, which is similar to the social service centers run by the author during the war in our country. Local governments in America also have this type of facility called welfare stations. These centers are places where people gather daily, and various services can be widely extended to the people through their organization, not only benefiting the people but also fostering a democratic spirit.</p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>The funding for social service undertakings in Britain and America comes purely from donations and is not subject to government support. Fundraisers cooperate with local organizations to jointly develop plans each year according to needs, determine budget estimates, and launch unified fundraising. The fundraising period is one month or several months, and they can all obtain the actual reports of social work and the detailed and reasonable expenditure listed to gain social trust. Although many British organizations raise funds from society on their own, they have recently tended towards joint fundraising. In addition to joint fundraising in America, there are also foundation donations or fundraising. Wealthy individuals contribute funds, designate welfare undertakings, and establish associations to manage the funds. The American government levies taxes, but mostly invests the funds in enterprises, using the surplus as funding. If the funds are deposited, the interest is very low. The second is to commemorate someone or launch a fundraising campaign for a certain event to fund designated welfare undertakings, but there are also occasional direct fundraising campaigns. The above-mentioned foundation donations or fundraising are also largely similar in Britain. In America, there is another type of donation that is coordinated with newspapers to appeal to society. For example, on December 9th last year, The New York Times sponsored the New York Social Service Society, the United Jewish Charities, and other six organizations to hold a hundred-case rescue campaign. The circumstances of how a hundred individuals or families in need of assistance were in distress, how to provide assistance, and how much funding was needed were listed in detail in the newspaper, along with illustrations depicting the distressed situation awaiting rescue. Each case required 300 to 1,000 US dollars. In less than ten days, the donations exceeded the amount needed. Donors contributed several dollars, tens of dollars, hundreds of dollars, etc., or designated to donate the funding for one or several cases. This campaign has been held annually since 1912 and has achieved very good results. It is similar to our country's winter relief campaign during the winter season, but its methods are much more advanced.</p>
<p>Talent</p>
<p>The talent in British and American social service undertakings is divided into professional and volunteer. According to Ann Elizabeth, the General Secretary of the American Association of Social Workers, there are currently 100,000 social work professionals in America. Those who graduated from social work schools account for 20%, those who received training after employment account for 20%, and the remaining 60% are those who have not received professional education. Women account for 85% of the personnel, but there is no personnel system. They rely on a passionate heart and can engage in this work for life. The number of professional personnel in Britain has also increased during the war, but statistical figures are not yet available. The ethos of volunteering is booming, especially during the war. For example, in military service and various rear services, women also account for the majority. These volunteer service personnel do not avoid hardship and danger and do not receive compensation. Their service spirit is admirable. Regarding professional education for social service workers, there are as many as 42 social work schools in America, most of which belong to universities, like a college. The social work schools of Columbia University and the University of Chicago are well-run and enjoy a high reputation. Although there are no specialized schools in Britain, a special committee was jointly organized by universities and service organizations in 1918. It designated universities to offer elective courses related to social service and designated social service agencies or organizations for internships, ranging from several months to two years. Certificates or degrees are awarded by the schools, limited to university graduates and experienced social workers or students who volunteer to study. The purpose of this approach is to enhance their knowledge of sociology and general knowledge, and the experience gained from internships is still beneficial. In addition, Britain and America have implemented international exchanges, visits, internships, and research for social service workers, in order to expand their theoretical knowledge and skills. The author, representing our country, has discussed and promoted this with Britain and America and will strive to make it happen.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, British and American social service undertakings are based on: (1) the encouragement of the government, implying encouragement through non-interference, enabling the ethos of public service to flourish; (2) relying on the skills of professional personnel, perfecting skills through action, enabling the widespread development of service undertakings, assisting governance, and benefiting the country and the people. These two cornerstones can serve as a reference for us and are the concluding remarks of the author's observations on this trip.</p>

<h3>Reader's Opinion: A Personal View on Punishing Traitors</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>After the victory, large and small traitors have been arrested one after another. The central government has clearly stipulated in the regulations on handling traitors that those below the commissioned level who held positions in the puppet regime within the past eight years due to hunger and cold must be judged based on the facts of their crimes, as reported or accused by the people. Only after investigation and verification can they be treated as traitors. The intention is to carefully handle the above-mentioned puppet regime personnel, striving to avoid injustices and promote unity to achieve the mission of national reconstruction. This approach is also painstakingly thought out. However, many troops and local governments have largely failed to appreciate this intention and often act emotionally, arbitrarily listening to the people's accusations and illegally arresting puppet regime personnel, resulting in extortion and blackmail, which is often heard of. If this continues, there will be no peaceful days. Not only will innocent people be harmed, creating opportunities for corruption, but also resentment will deepen. Once forced to take risks, it will hinder local security and the future of national reconstruction. I am a citizen of the country and sincerely cannot remain silent. Therefore, I will present my limited views as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The government should quickly finalize the verdicts for the arrested traitors to demonstrate credibility.</p>
<p>(2) A deadline should be set for the people to report those below the commissioned level who held positions in the puppet regime, and accusations should be stopped after the deadline, so as to concentrate manpower and enhance national reconstruction effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) Any troops or local governments handling traitor cases should comply with the central government's laws and regulations. Violations should be treated as dereliction of duty to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Although the above points may have omissions, they are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. I dare to ask your newspaper to publish them to express public opinion. Jiang Cheng (March 3rd)</p>

<p>Free Talk: Special Edition on Women and Family</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>"To Raise Without Teaching is the Father's Fault"</h3>
<p>— Tracing the Cause</p>
<p>We often see in the newspapers announcements of "severing the relationship between father and son (or father and daughter, mother and son, mother and daughter)" and "statements expelling bad sons," which invariably say: "Rebellious son (or bad son) so-and-so is willing to become depraved, associating with criminals, and repeatedly refuses to repent... Severing the relationship between father and son, in the future, if he borrows money from others or engages in any illegal activities, it will have nothing to do with me."</p>
<p>Whenever I see such announcements, I always feel that the parents of those "ungrateful sons" view the relationship between parents and children too simply and superficially—almost like friends! And they take it too easy to extinguish the relationship between parents and children with just an announcement!</p>
<p>Is the relationship between parents and children possible? Is there anyone in the world without parents? The physiological relationship between parents and children cannot be eliminated by human power, nor can it be severed by a few lines of announcement. This is impossible in fact, and it is not allowed by the conscience of the parents.</p>
<p>In today's society, where the family is still a unit of society, the children in the family should be well-educated by the parents. No one is born with the habit of "willing to become depraved." If they are "willing to become depraved," it is a failure of parental education. Parents should bear the responsibility for the failure. How can the responsibility be lightly shrugged off with the four words "repeatedly refuses to repent"? Of course, the downfall of a child is also related to the school and society. We cannot place all the responsibility squarely on the parents, but the parents should bear the greatest responsibility, which is beyond doubt. When a child goes astray, society has one more—no, it should be said that it has one more "black sheep." This is the crime of the parents, and they should deeply blame themselves, reflecting on where they have failed to educate their children in the past and how to remedy it in the future. Perhaps the parents' own consciousness and behavior are incorrect and improper. Then, "if their own conduct is not upright," naturally "their orders will not be followed." If so, they must first repent and correct their mistakes, and then cultivate themselves to exert a demonstrative effect in the family. It must be understood that there cannot be a double standard of morality in a family. It is not permissible for parents to smoke opium under the pretext of being old and sick, but not allow their children to smoke; it is not permissible for fathers to have three wives and four concubines under the pretext of having many descendants, but not allow their sons to engage in frivolous activities—all kinds of contradictory phenomena!</p>
<p>When their children go astray, parents simply publish a few lines of announcement to shirk all responsibility. But may I ask, where will your children go? Especially in Chinese society, society has never been responsible for education. Naturally, beggars, vagrants, thieves, and prostitutes will be their inevitable destination. As long as the parents no longer have to spend their money, no longer have to be implicated or disturbed by their children, they will "regard the prosperity or poverty of their children as if they were from a different country."</p>
<p>"To raise without teaching is the father's fault." I believe that this kind of crime of not fulfilling parental responsibilities is even worse than abandoning infants on the roadside. Abandoning infants is certainly cruel, but "expelling bad sons" will cause even more harm to society. However, abandoning infants is a punishable crime under the law, while "expelling bad sons" is not subject to legal sanctions!</p>
<p>Society</p>
<h3>Chinese Women Under Feudal Forces</h3>
<p>— Wan Zi</p>
<p>Feudal society is a male-centered society. Women in feudal society have no status, especially since the Chinese feudal system has undergone a particularly long period of development. Therefore, the constraints and misfortunes suffered by Chinese women are particularly profound.</p>
<p>There have also been women in history who have served as the political center of China, such as Wu Zetian. She was very talented and a very outstanding politician, but this was only an occasional event, and when she was in power, she did not change the status of women in society at that time. She acted like a man as emperor, and her officials were all men.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese feudal social history of more than two thousand years has had different ideologies in its development stages, the Confucian thought supported by the ruling class of feudal society has always been advocated and worshiped. Confucius's attitude towards women was "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," placing petty men and women side by side, which has some class meaning. Petty men are the ruled class, discriminated against and driven to run errands, and women are no exception. They are supported and played with to survive.</p>
<p>Later scholars promoted Confucius's theory of women and petty men, repeatedly quoting and proving that women are a source of misfortune. This is the "female disaster" in history, and therefore the status of women has continued to decline.</p>
<p>In order to prevent women from resisting or stepping out of the realm of being ruled in thought and action, feudal scholars formulated many "virtues" that women should abide by and also produced some special books, such as Biographies of Heroic Women, Female Rules, Female Analects, and Daughter's Sutras. The summary of these books is no more than the three obediences and four virtues, which everyone knows.</p>
<p>However, these theories obviously still have some women who cannot fully "abide by," and the method of rewards came into being. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, "heroic women" were most valued, and many chastity arches were built during these two periods. However, the punishment for violations was also particularly severe. Murdering one's husband was considered a hundred times more serious than robbery and murder. The "seven grounds for divorce" was an even more incredible law, although this law existed before then.</p>
<p>The highest expression of feudal society's oppression of women is concretely expressed as "lack of talent is a virtue for women." Women were not allowed to read books, only allowed to do things at home, and at the same time had their feet bound, losing their freedom of action forever.</p>
<p>In recent decades, from the Xinhai Revolution to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chinese women have gained some freedom and liberation, but the feudal remnants have obviously not diminished. This explains why the vast majority of Chinese women—especially in rural areas and small cities—are still in a miserable life and unequal circumstances.</p>
<p>Feudalism and women's issues are inextricably linked. Feudal society has undergone a particularly long period of time, and its roots are therefore particularly deep. Solving the women's issue should also eliminate the remaining feudal forces.</p>
<h3>The Origin of International Women's Day</h3>
<p>— Ou Li</p>
<p>International Women's Day originated in the United States.</p>
<p>In March 1909, the American women's community expressed dissatisfaction with the inequality between men and women and held a grand Women's Day in major cities across the country. All women's groups participated. This was the embryo of International Women's Day.</p>
<p>In 1910, the Socialist Women's Congress was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. It proposed that March 8th of each year be designated as International Women's Day, with the goal of obtaining women's suffrage and political rights, while promoting the economic and social liberation of women. Since then, women in various countries have held International Women's Day every year.</p>
<p>This is how International Women's Day was born.</p>
<h3>Women Having Talent Is Virtue (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Looking Down on Morality and Ignoring Power</p>
<p>Those who say "Lack of talent in women is a virtue" overlook these two points: First, they do not recognize the social significance of morality, underestimate the scope of morality, and ignore the factors of the times and social changes. A woman who is unprogressive, conservative, and weak is regarded as virtuous. Without a sense of justice or a career ambition, only knowing to be respectful, tolerant, and yielding under the enslavement of men, not showing a bit of personality, not revealing a bit of emotion, not knowing to strive for one's own independent personality, not knowing to improve one's knowledge and economic status through learning and working, and spending a lifetime in ignorance – to call this "virtue" is to underestimate the ideal of morality, no, it is simply misunderstanding the intrinsic and extrinsic meaning of morality. Second, it covets the greatest power in the world – knowledge. We must know that sufficient knowledge is the guide to our good behavior. Without true insight, how can there be expressions of noble behavior? Many heroes and heroines of virtue in ancient times, their heroic and righteous virtues, are worthy of being passed down for thousands of years and will never perish. Which of them did not have rich talent and learning? Yue Wu Mu, Wen Tianxiang, Shi Kefa, and other great patriots in history, their ardent hearts, were all forged by knowledge. They had a very noble ideal of life. They knew where justice and truth lay, who were the enemies, and what could not be compromised. After sighing, "What have we learned from reading the books of sages?", they resolutely sacrificed their lives for righteousness and completed their benevolence through martyrdom.</p>
<p>Moral behavior is a reflection of knowledge and a practice of knowledge. "Knowing" and "doing" are certainly two different things, but there must be a connection between the two to express their significance. Wang Yangming advocated the theory of "unity of knowledge and action," saying that action comes from knowledge. He believed that "some people know but do not act," in reality, it is "not true knowledge." The Father of the Nation strongly advocated the doctrine of "knowing is difficult, acting is easy," even more so to encourage people to strive for true knowledge. In the modern world, China is the most backward in science and has the lowest cultural level. Popularizing the wisdom of the people and promoting culture are urgently needed in the process of nation-building. However, women's education in China is even less widespread. The knowledge of ordinary women is very poor, and they have very few educational opportunities. These ignorant and uninformed women not only cannot participate in social work and become "members of society" who serve the people, but even if they are taught to manage the household and educate their children, they cannot be ideal mothers and wives due to the lack of modern family knowledge. Therefore, the urgent task is to improve women's knowledge level and popularize women's educational opportunities. – Amidst the chorus of "striving for women's suffrage" and "promoting equal economic status for men and women," we must thoroughly discard the reactionary teachings of "lack of talent in women is virtue" that have dominated the minds of the general public in our country for thousands of years and quickly replace them with "women having talent is virtue"!</p>
<p>The So-Called "Talented Women" of Ancient Times</p>
<p>It is said that in ancient China, there were so-called "talented women" whose brilliance was outstanding and intelligence surpassed others, but who were often weak in physique, had unfortunate lives, and drifted throughout their lives.</p>
<p>They met unsuitable partners, or died before middle age. Those so-called "great scholars" in society then said that because they were too intelligent and their talent was too extraordinary, they inevitably had thin virtue. According to the arguments of modern physiologists and psychologists, true geniuses do not belong to them – geniuses should be superior in all aspects, with both body and mind developing to the highest degree. Furthermore, it is also wrong to look at the whole from a part. To draw the conclusion that "lack of talent in women is virtue" based on the misfortunes of a few "talented women" is just as illogical as the saying "beautiful women have ill-fated lives since ancient times." Moreover, the idea that high intelligence and rich talent easily lead to an unsound character is especially absurd. I cannot deny that a small number of women with a high level of knowledge and moderate intelligence may inevitably have lapses in behavior, but this can only be regarded as accidental and is insufficient to prove "lack of talent in women is virtue." In fact, those who make this kind of example are simply admitting that "women who have talent have no virtue." But on the other hand, I cannot deny that women with a higher level of knowledge and intelligence must have higher life ideals than ordinary women, and their thoughts must be more progressive than ordinary women, and their contributions to the family and society must be greater than ordinary women.</p>
<p>Motive Determines the Value of Behavior</p>
<p>Moreover, modern ethicists unanimously agree that the most important thing in determining the standard of moral behavior is the "motive" that creates the behavior. The same good behavior must also be judged by the goodness of the "motive" to determine the value of the behavior. This means that the results of many people's behavior may be very good, but the "motive" is not necessarily good. To make our "motive" good, it is all a matter of "knowing." The good behavior of an ignorant person can only be regarded as accidental, blind, not conscious, not purposeful.</p>
<p>The moral behavior needed by modern citizens should naturally be completely conscious and purposeful: understanding why this matter must be done in this way. Loyal and courageous behavior is good, but</p>
<p>What is the meaning of loyalty and courage? That is something that the ignorant and uninformed cannot understand. It is certainly good to have good behavior, but wouldn't it be even better if the "motive" is also good?</p>
<p>In any aspect, my proposed "women having talent is virtue" has a sociological and psychological basis. I hope that the social circles' view on women's education should not deviate from the social evolution and the requirements of the times, and should re-measure the social and psychological standards of the past. On the one hand, I more enthusiastically hope that women themselves will stand up and demand: popularize women's educational opportunities, improve women's knowledge and skills, strive for independent personality through thorough self-awareness, so as to achieve true political and economic equality for men and women!</p>
<h3>Family Maxims</h3>
<p>— Wen Quanlu</p>
<p>Movement generates vital energy, thrift gathers and conserves energy. With these two words, there is no reason why family fortunes will not flourish.</p>
<p>If the family is harmonious, blessings will arise naturally. If in a family, the elder brother speaks and the younger brother obeys, and the younger brother asks and the elder brother responds, harmony rises and fills the household. There is no reason for the family to not prosper. Conversely, there is no reason for the family to not fall apart if the inverse happens.</p>
<p>When brothers are harmonious, even the poorest families will thrive; when brothers are not harmonious, even noble and powerful families will fall.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Trifling Words on Women's Day</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wanyu</p>
<p>Today is another March 8th Women's Day. I really want to say some grand and beautiful words, but I can't say them. After thinking for a long time, I can only say a few "words."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that this Women's Day is a day for women to vent their anger. On this day, women, whether they can do it or not, must hold a meeting, give a speech, and march to commemorate it. It's like this every year. In China alone, there have been more than twenty times.</p>
<p>On this day, knowledgeable people stand on the stage and shout loudly, and uneducated people follow behind and yell wildly. After a busy day, when they wake up, they forget everything that happened the day before. Knowledgeable women still have disagreements with their husbands and suffer psychological abuse; uneducated women are beaten by their husbands and suffer physical abuse. Why? Economic dependence is a major reason.</p>
<p>Do women with money always have a good life? Not necessarily. At least they won't be scolded for wanting some money for groceries, or scolded for wanting some pocket money.</p>
<p>Women will never have a good life if they don't recognize their own position, what they should do, and what they need to do. Taking shortcuts and flattering men only results in being labeled as a "flower vase." Knowledgeable women are not necessarily greater or more moral than uneducated women. Rural women, in addition to their primary role of giving birth and raising children, also till the land, cut grass, carry water, and grind flour, and are in no way inferior to men. China can exist on Earth because of the strength of 70-80% of its farmers, and in farming, women and men are equal, so rural women are not disgraceful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what about knowledgeable women? Those who participate in politics are fighting for power, those who talk about culture are excluding each other, and those who run businesses are undercutting each other. They only look at the shadows in the clouds, and rarely sincerely care about the hard-working women of the masses. They only care about taking advantage of themselves and showing off.</p>
<p>They can't write articles, sew clothes, cook, make rice, take care of children, teach students, lift a hoe, or sweep the floor. They just sit in cars or rickshaws provided by men to do "women's movement," which is really a joke.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's their own fault that they are looked down upon and pushed out by men. Women, don't cover your noses and cry, only hard work is useful. What? This is a trifle, do you want to listen or not?</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<h3>Proxy Marriage</h3>
<p>— Mi Weiliang</p>
<p>——The Man With the Most Marriages</p>
<p>In the court of Kansas City, Kansas, stands a tall, middle-aged man wearing glasses. Beside him is a young and beautiful woman, holding his hand. It turns out that they are undergoing the marriage ceremony. As the ceremony is completed, the middle-aged man gently pats the woman's back and kisses her forehead.</p>
<p>The groom said to the judge: "Thank you, you troubled yourself." At the same time, he gave the judge a five-dollar bill.</p>
<p>"Is this your thirty-eighth or thirty-ninth marriage?" the judge asked him.</p>
<p>"Thirty-ninth marriage," the middle-aged man replied.</p>
<p>This middle-aged man is called Thomas Finnegan. Although he has been married thirty-nine times, he has never divorced, nor has his wife ever died, and each of his marriages is legal.</p>
<p>It turns out that in February 1943, he received a letter from a Miss White, saying: Near Lake Superior, a young lady and a sailor are deeply in love. When they were preparing to get married, the sailor suddenly received orders and needed to go overseas immediately, but they still hoped to find a way to get married. So, a lawyer in Chicago suggested to Miss White that he had heard that the state of Kansas had a law for proxy marriage. So Miss White asked Finnegan if he knew about this matter.</p>
<p>After reading the letter, Finnegan went to look up law books and found that it was true. He also asked a local judge to be the officiant, and wrote to Miss White saying: If this lady is willing to come to Kansas City to hold a proxy marriage ceremony, he would be happy to represent her husband and be a groom in the wedding ceremony. A few weeks later, they held the wedding.</p>
<p>Later, he represented an army soldier in a church and got engaged to a Chicago lady. In the following months, he averaged two marriages per week. Before Japan surrendered, he had already scheduled thirty wedding dates. At that time, there were more than sixty applications to him for this type of wedding.</p>
<p>Most of the wives he married often wrote to him after the wedding, telling him how their lives were after the wedding. Most of them were very happy. However, one wife asked Finnegan to represent her husband and go to court to go through divorce procedures. So he wrote to her, asking her to explain the reasons for the divorce, and hoped that she would consider the matter carefully and not act rashly. At the same time, he also wrote to her husband, telling him his position and situation in this case. In short, Finnegan hoped that they could reconcile.</p>
<p>Before the end of this war, he received letters from three service members, saying that they wanted to get married, but their lovers were serving the country and were far away overseas, so he was also prepared to use his own wife.</p>
<p>Finnegan's profession is a lawyer, but he doesn't want to get rich by proxy marriage. So, he only charges fifteen U.S. dollars each time he gets married. The lawyer is because only Kansas in the United States has this law: people can legally marry by proxy, so many ladies come from thousands of miles away. Some come from Los Angeles in the west, and some come from Corona in the east. Finnegan represents their lovers and acts as a groom in the wedding ceremony, representing these sailors and soldiers overseas to swear. Most ladies have a very good impression of Finnegan: they feel that he is not only clever and intelligent, but also understands human affairs and people's psychology.</p>
<p>As for Finnegan's own wife, she is not jealous of him being a groom in proxy marriages. Once she said to others: "I don't care how many times Finnegan gets married, because he doesn't go on a honeymoon with these girls!"</p>
<p>Arrangement</p>
<h3>Ten Principles of Room Arrangement</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The post-war world is generally experiencing a housing shortage, and China is no exception, especially Shanghai. Since the recovery, people from the rear have flocked to Shanghai. If you have relatives or friends who have just returned from the mainland and can't find a house for a while, and their finances don't allow them to stay in a hotel, can you not find a way to give them one or two empty rooms? At this time, rearranging the room is urgently needed. Effective room arrangement can sometimes compensate for many shortcomings and make you feel much more pleasant. The so-called "a simple room need not be large"!</p>
<p>The following points are for reference.</p>
<p>(1) If not necessary, do not place tables and chairs in the center of the room, as this is inconvenient for people walking around.</p>
<p>(2) People often like to place cabinets and dressing tables at an angle, which takes up a lot of space and is not as comfortable to look at as placing them straight against the wall.</p>
<p>(3) Do not place tall furniture near the window, or even block the window, as this will hinder the light source and make you feel mentally unhappy.</p>
<p>(4) Bulky items should be placed in larger rooms, as they will make you feel suffocated if placed in small rooms.</p>
<p>(5) A bed without a canopy is more comfortable to look at than a bed with a canopy.</p>
<p>(6) Painting the walls with light colors and cold colors such as lotus root pink and light blue will give you a more spacious feeling.</p>
<p>(7) If the windows are too small, it is advisable to hang a hypothetical curtain on both sides of the window, one or two feet away, to compensate for the lack.</p>
<p>(8) Placing one or two bottles of fresh flowers or goldfish in the room in appropriate places can make you feel much more comfortable.</p>
<p>(9) The lamp must be hung high, in the center of the room. It is not advisable to install it too low, or to hang it in the corner of the room, on the bed, or on the table.</p>
<p>(10) Non-essential items should be stored as much as possible, and should not be piled up arbitrarily in the corner of the room or on the table, as this is not only unsightly, but also makes it difficult to clean the room.</p>
<p>Toys</p>
<h3>Little Cloth Doll</h3>
<p>— Lu Shufang</p>
<p>This is a very easy-to-make little toy, which can be used as a small gift to coax children or placed in a sewing basket as a pin cushion.</p>
<p>Materials: Any scraps of fabric, as long as the colors are bright (it is even more beautiful if made of velvet), a small piece of washed white cloth (for the face), a ball of cotton or scrap fabric scraps.</p>
<p>Manufacturing method: Cut down according to the size of the cloth pieces, according to the line points, first sew the body and the bottom of the body together to form a cylindrical shape, fill with scrap cloth or cotton, and then sew the face according to the line points, fill with cotton (the side of the face exposed should be flat), sew and tie the lower end, and then sew the pointed hat on the head, and sew it tightly with the body. Both arms and legs are also sewn together and stuffed with cotton. Arrange them properly, and an interesting little cloth doll is completed. Then sew the hands and feet to form a shape, draw the face, tie a ribbon around the neck, and finally tie a silk rope at the end of the hat, which is completed. It can be enlarged or reduced according to this example in the figure.</p>
