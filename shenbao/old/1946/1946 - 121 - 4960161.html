<h3>烟雨迷濛訪莫干</h3>
<p>— 儲裕生</p>
<p>相傳在春秋的時候，吳王夫差的父親闔廬命令干將到西南的一座山上去鑄劍，鑄劍的時候，鐵汁不下，他的妻子問：「鐵汁不下，有何妙計」？干將說：「先師歐冶　劍不銷，以女人嫁爐神就能銷」。莫邪聽了以後，就竄入爐中，鐵汁果出，遂煉成二劍，雄號「干將」，雌號「莫邪」。後人爲紀念干將莫邪鑄劍的艱苦，就把這座山名爲莫干山。自後山上也有一些人家居住，到淸代，寺庵很多，洪楊革命起後，莫干山也遭到了兵燹，遂荒蕪不堪了。四十年前，美人梅藤根來此，入山打獵，覺得風景佳麗，想召集當地人民來開發此山，適有安徽工人多人經過，經一號召，大家出力開發，後來慢慢地成爲名勝之區，這裏黃膺白先生確也化了不少的力氣，及至民國二十六年前後，莫干山的大名，已遠播海外，成爲國際著名的避暑勝地了。</p>
<p>八年艱苦的抗戰，莫干山也在烽火中度過了歲月，勝利後，莫干山的復興，成爲浙江政治上經濟上的課題，而到莫干山路上的不靖消息，時有所聞，爲了確實明瞭她的近况，才決定有莫干山之行。</p>
<p>是日天上飄着雨，地上很濘滑，我們乘着一九四〇年的「皮而克」小轎車出發，過拱辰橋，滑上京杭國道，這條路在戰前是異常平坦的，但在現在簡直成了崎嶇的山路，我們的車不斷地跳動着，路上的石頭與車底鋼板的撞擊聲音，泥漿四濺，好像浪裏行舟的聲音，眞呌人懷疑能不能到達莫干山？一座座的木橋，都是用四五根木頭釘搭而成，有一座半邊的底板塌了，凌空架着幾根木頭，你要在上面通過，簡直爲司機朋友揑一把汗。</p>
<p>過小河良渚，到瓶窰，那裏僅是一些買賣木頭的商人，再經彭公，東　，此處本來茂林修竹，車人經過，如在畫中，現在却是一片荒凉，那京杭國道築成時植下的白楊綠柳，高逾數丈，可惜兩傍剩下的已寥寥可數，共餘的聽說已被敵偽等砍伐了。過上柏，那是「不妥」的地方，見那遠近的山上，都有戰時遺的碉堡建築，車到武康，這裏已不像一個縣城，所有房屋，幾都燬於砲火，斷垣殘壁，到處荒蕪，留下了凄凉的印象。一些小的市集，是臨時蓋搭的房舍，縣政府借設在民房內，全縣僅五萬多人，戰爭後的殘破，像武康那樣，着實要費些時間精力，才能恢復舊觀。</p>
<p>車越三轎埠，到廋村，便是莫干山脚下，幾個老百姓指給我看以往何處是停車間，何處是停馬間，何處是停轎間，何處是遊客登記處，現在只剩下一些殘破的房屋，據說敵人曾來此數次，曾與遊擊隊作戰，後來新四軍又來，許多房屋被砲火燬的燬了，被拆除的拆除了。這裏山脚下本來有五六千人，現在只有五六百人了，因爲莫干山的開發，安徽人費了很多力氣，所以安徽籍的人特別多，僅就現在的五六百人中，也有三分之二是安徽籍的，他們每日砍些柴，爲人捐負些東西，來度他們的日子。</p>
<p>山脚下，有一座小學，建築得非常好，名莫千小學，校內設備亦佳，小朋友有三百多，他們的家長大半都是山的附近的農胞。據說在戰時他們沒有停過課，敵人來了，他們匿在山裏繼續上課，敵人去了，又搬回來，一直到勝利前新四軍來了，敵人來了，游撃隊也來了，才在元法中絃歌中　。</p>
<p>我們步行上山，先走新路，此路爲民十八年所建築，儼如小馬路，水門汀製成的接水管和鐵製的接水管，在路上可以看得出來，不過已是淤塞和殘破了。</p>
<p>這裏眞是名不虛傳的勝地，層峯疊翠，林木參天，路旁間或有紫籐的落英，和躱在野草叢襄的玫瑰和薔薇，那石榴也賣弄風姿，不過她正在滋長呢？據說路旁本來植滿名花，現在已殘缺不全了。</p>
<p>雨雖然還是下，雖然望出去是烟霧迷濛，但眼前的景物，亦足够留戀了。</p>
<p>過天池寺，有新舊天池之分，新天池在寺傍，一小小的水潭，據說此處五色小魚捉之不盡。舊天池在另一處，周慶雲曾立碑以記，周曾在杭州韜光洗眼，取金蓮而栽之，現在還有幾片蓮葉。</p>
<p>再往上爬，向下俯望，見綠樹似雲，此起彼伏，山邊有人石刻「拂雲」兩字，又至劍池，是當年干將莫邪煉劍之所，有磨劍石一塊，水一潭，使人緬想前人的景况。又到蘆花蕩，此處水極淸明，相傳飲之延壽，山民說外國人來此，每取水歸去煮飯。</p>
<p>另到石頭寺，雙石之間出一似玉的石鐘乳，旁有一寺，名石頤寺。再到蓮社，此是顯要虔修之地，建築新型，暑天顯要與富者來山，必到此處虔修一番，張靜江，戴傳賢等均曾有文記之。</p>
<p>路旁遠近，是一幢幢最新設備，別具匠心的洋樓，想見當年盛暑時的繁盛，我們曾訪莫干山管理局，據負責人吿訴我們，要復興莫干山，第一要修路，第二要充實警備，此山有三百餘家，把房屋編成六百二十三號，原先山上有營造廠多家，銅匠多家，並有郵局，電信局以及規模）宏大的鐵路飯店，山上有球塲，有遊泳池，現在一切都廢弛了。此刻已在山上開始修理房屋的，已有六七家人家，總望大家能絡繹回來，復興莫干山，山的西北爲孝峯安吉，東北爲吳興，可謂爲杭州的鎖　。</p>
<p>我們循老路回來，老路亦砌以水門汀石級，可見當時經營此山的講究。沿途樹木森森，竹林片片，眞是呌人不忍離去。</p>
<p>歸來，仍舊踏上這條顚簸不平如在海浪中行進的路，我想到莫千山，是够美麗的避暑勝地，但是要復興莫干山，必須要把道路修好，充實警備力量。</p>
<p>聽說浙江省政府主席沈鴻烈決定修整道路與充實警備力量，來復興這避暑的勝地。（四月二十八日夜寄）</p>

<p>〔本報蘇州三十日電〕陳逆壁君。褚逆民誼判決後，今日已届第八天，各界人士以陳逆曾於法庭受鞫時，大言曰革命者受國法判裁，祇有死與無罪二途，庭上判我死刑，固屬心甘情願，設判我徒刑，必不甘服等語，故對彼等已申請覆判，傳說紛紜，莫衷一是。記者特於三十日下午四時許謁見高院孫院長鴻霖，承發表談話如下：高院迄今尙未收獲陳褚兩逆之覆判聲請書，惟依據規定，尙有三天，始作放棄。關於陳逆公博，繆逆斌申請覆判事，亦未接奉最高法院覆文，依照特種刑事訴訟條例之明文，最高法院常於接得本院詳文後，於二十天內完成裁定之手續，惟兼亦有他故躭延，未便遽予論斷。然以木人所見，陳逆等爲叛國元兇，縱使與中央特務機構取得聯繫，掩護志士，而證以向英美宣戰，即在希冀聯合國覆亡，我中央政府又將焉存，何異直接斷喪國本，故其功過懸殊，絕難相抵，雖云法律不外人情，亦貴乎勿假勿倚，不能避重就輕，取小棄大，設徒以婦人之仁，不置之重典，則次而下者，何以量刑。輿論爲人民喉舌，應倡導民衆，咸認淸法律觀點所在，毋予懸揣。</p>

<h3>杭市糧價陡漲出四萬元大關</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州卅日電〕杭市連日降雨，有利農作，而糧價反漲風特甚，白米已躍過四萬大關，米商尙筐空無貨，糧食公會以硤石。無錫產區價格高於杭市爲理由，存糧僅能維持十日，並請求杭市民食調節委員會舉行緊急會議，調整糧價，因以市民惶恐爭相奔吿。本報記者頃訪在杭之權威經濟學家，承吿今年全世界均鬧糧荒，吾國允然，政院善救署曾向聯總署請求救濟，而所獲未如理想，兼以南通局勢不寗，或基此原因，糧價抬高。據事實觀之，杭市糧食實未至極度急慌之程度，所以糧價陡漲，其中人爲因素有大半。</p>

<h3>勝利後的首屆勞動節</h3>
<p>今年今日，是我們八年抗戰勝利以後的第一届勞動節！</p>
<p>今年今日，是我們開始戰後建設的第一屆勞動佳節！</p>
<p>我們於抗戰勝利建國肇始的今年今日，祝賀勞動節，實在懷着無限的熱情，感到空前的欣幸，願向全國勞動界敬致坦白誠懇的新祝望；</p>
<p>回顧過去八年，全國勞動同胞，與全國作戰軍人，以無限的「血」和無量的「汗」，培植這朵燦爛鮮艷的勝利之花！舉國軍民於壯烈犧牲與夙夜勤勞下，經歷了多少的艱險痛苦，努力奮門，纔爭到光榮的勝利！</p>
<p>抗戰期間，我們目覩：</p>
<p>（一）我們的工業勞動同胞，隨着工廠的內遷，大家離鄕背井，胞進山谷，利用殘破的機器，簡陋的設備，於敵機空襲頻繁下努力增產，供應前方軍需，維持後方民生。他們不分寒暑，不分晝夜，相茶淡飯，茅舍破衣，始終做着民族抗戰的工業鬥士。他們沒有糾紛，他們也絕不怕苦，他們更從來沒有怠工罷工！</p>
<p>（二）我們的礦業勞動同胞，爲着資源的開發，大家翻山越嶺，手拿粗拙的工具，走進深淵的礦塲。他們在冰天雪地，蠻烟療氣中，努力開發，加强經濟作戰的資源，不愧爲民族抗戰的經濟動員之一支生力軍。他們沒有怨恨，他們也沒有畏縮，他們更從來沒有怠工罷工！</p>
<p>（三）我們的交通勞動同胞，爲適應軍事需要，盡力於道路的開闢，大家長途跋涉，風餐露宿，在崇山峻嶺中　築公路，更開着常常拋錨的汽車，行駛險的山谷。他們不顧狂風暴雨，不顧炎蒸冰凍，加强頻繁的軍運，甚至過着忍饑耐寒，茹毛飲血的原始生活，形成了爲民族抗戰的交通大動脈。他們沒有憤慨，他們也沒有逃避，他們更從來沒有怠工罷工！</p>
<p>今年今日日，抗戰勝利已有九月，我們全國勞動同胞，對於民族國家的貢獻，實在太偉大了！我們這次抗戰，老實說，旣沒有豐富的物力，也沒有雄厚的財力，祇仗着我們的許多血和汗的人力！所以，全國勞動同胞的功勛，與流血作戰的將士可以媲美。今年今日勞動界的朋友熱烈慶祝你們的勞動節，實在太有豐富的意義了！</p>
<p>今日的世界，人類正向着和平·民主·繁榮·幸福的大道上邁進。今日的中國，全民族正在努力建設自由·獨立·富强康樂的新國家。全國的勞動同胞，今日全都認淸了你們的重任，也都會盡其全力，發揚抗戰的光榮歷史，繼續爲建設一個現代工業化的新中國而努力，國家的富强，民生的康樂，這是我們三民主義的目的，也就是全國勞動界胼手胝足所要收穫的成果。</p>
<p>我們回顧過去，展望將來，不得不率直檢討：我們願以坦白的胸懷，誠懇的期望，的略說出當前中國工業的陰霾暗雲。</p>
<p>復員伊始，建國肇端，淪陷八年的上海，回到祖國的懷抱，重爲全國經濟的心臟。近幾月來，由於物價的昂騰，影響民生的艱困，上海勞動同胞，自然同樣感到深切的痛苦。我們敢斷言：今日的痛苦，絕不是限於勞動界，除去發「國難財」和「勝利財」的民族敗類，國家蟊賊，社會罪人還在驕奢淫逸放浪享受而外，是大家都痛苦。我們再敢說：今日比較勞動同胞痛苦更深更大的也還有人在！上海工資，果能隨着物價指數而調整，那末比較一般軍公敎人員的待遇，還算差强人意。上海勞動同胞，很多明達，不必贅述。何况當前這種痛苦，大戰之後，勢所難免。我們放眼遠望世界，除得天獨厚的美國而外，那一個國家的國民不痛苦？以中國的貧窮，又當戰後，何能例外？勝利以還，上海工潮澎湃，糾紛不絕，其原因全由於一個「窮」字而來。物價日高，生活日苦，我們對於全國勞動同胞的迫切要求，自有無限同情。但一想到中國工業的前途，却又不能不在慶祝聲中說幾句警惕勉勵的話：</p>
<p>今日的大勢，實在機會太好了！我們認爲：</p>
<p>第一，日本戰敗了，中國工業理可抬頭。一九〇五年日俄戰後，日本工業蓬勃發展，掠奪中國廉價原料，利用其本國賤價勞工，從事輕工業的發展，尤其以紡織工業，化學工業的產品，傾銷中國市塲。九一八以前，日本對華貿易，竟佔第一位，凌駕英國之上，而美國則瞠乎其後。九一入以後，日本更以「工業日本，農業中國」即所謂「中日經濟提携」，這一套經濟侵略政策來壓迫中國工業的發展。如今，日本戰敗了，我們中國工業剷除了一個勁敵，今後中國工業發展，無限光明。</p>
<p>第二，不平等條約廢除了，百年束縛，一旦解放，中國工業宜可自主。以前，中國經濟受到不平等條約約束縛太大，外人在華，根據特權優惠，利用中國賤價勞工，更利用中國原料，祇要帶來資金設備（機器等）及技術，即可在華自由設廠製造，加以洋貨自海外輸入，稅捐反較國產爲輕，以致窮鄉僻壤，皆成爲外貨市塲。而今，不平等條約廢除了，我們中國工業應可减少外來壓力。</p>
<p>第三，美國積極協助下，中國工業可以迅速發達。中國工業所以落後，一來缺乏經濟建設計劃，二來缺乏科學技術，三來沒有大量資本（內資及外資）。今後中國工業，政府已有整個經濟建設計劃，積極利用外資，加以美國技術上和設備上的充分協助，前途發展，正無限量。</p>
<p>總之，中國工業內在外在的障碍和困難，今日都應可以克服。惟有中國工業的發展，纔是中國勞動界一條光明燦燜的大道。然而，在今日要望中國工業的發展，大有待於我們勞資雙方的自覺與努力。</p>
<p>其一，我們祝望勞資糾紛，不再發生，怠工罷工亦不再見。目前工業雖說困難多端，危機潛伏，但實質說來，只要通貨緊縮，幣制調整，交通恢復，生產增加，物價自可趨於穩定。穩定物價，固非一朝一夕之功，但政府和人民確應共同努力，求其貫澈。在物價尙未穩定之今日，雖一時感到痛苦，不能積極迅速的恢復戰前生活水準，但只要大家努力增產，則工資與生活，政府自可以合理方法解決。怠工罷工，只有削减生產，生產銳减，何能富國？上海各業，工資近已大多重行調整，依生活費指數爲升降，則增工資减工時，資方旣有所容納，勞動界即須十分注意工廠紀律和工作效率。工作效率的增加，如能與工資增加成爲正比，則工資縱隨物價指數而上升尙不足爲工業之大患，或反可因此而刺激工業管理方法之改進。故今天的問題在工資之爭論，已不若工作紀律之重要。我們絕不願見素稱勤勞的中國勞動界，沾染動輒怠工罷工的習氣，重使中國工業陷於窘境，工廠固多關閉，工人也苦失業！</p>
<p>其二，我們祝望勞工待遇，從工業發展中獲得提高。國父說：「中國工人要增高地位，是有兩種條件的：第一，便是整個民族的獨立，第二便是本國工業的發展。如果整個民族還在帝國主義壓迫之下，工人要求單獨解放，是萬萬做不到的。所以我們第一，要增進民族的地位，離開民族利益，沒有工人利益。第二，要從發展中國工業之中，求中國工人生活的改善。中國工業一日不發展，中國工人幸福便一日不能實現」。今日中國民族已獲獨立，第一條件可稱已具，故勞工生活與待遇的改善，此後應從發展工業中求得圓滿結果。中國國民黨去年五月六中全會所通過「勞工政策綱領」之第一條，對勞工地位的提高，勞工生活的改善，早已確切制定：「勞工政策之目標，在依國家民族至上之原則與國際合作之精神，發展勞工組織，提高其地位，改善其生活，並促進勞資合作，調節勞力供求，增進勞動效能，加強國際勞動聯繫，以確保社會安全，適應國防民生之需要」。其他各案，對於勞工福利之增進，亦可謂爲盡善盡美。今後只須全國上下努力實行便好。美國國務院最近提供將於今年夏季召開國際貿易就業會議建議書中，有關於「解除躭心生產及就業失常的疑懼」的一段：「一國果能從事於有規律的全面生產，對外貿易與日俱增，這就是一民族所能加惠於全世界生產者的最大利益」。我們在邁進建國的道上，固沒有能力將工業生產品推銷於海外，但至少應有製造工業品供給自己消費的努力。我們此時應該沒有「失業」的恐懼，而何以竟會有失業現象，可見中國工業所受的創傷已甚深重。我們祝望在全國各大都市勞資評斷委員會成立以後，一切勞資爭議都能作合理的協議，合法的調處，使中國工業在和平安定的環境中透一口氣，然後更從技術管理一切力求精進的條件下，走上逐步發展的大道。必如此，中國工業始有希望，中國勞動界也纔有幸福。</p>

<h3>貝爾納斯提出建議　四強訂互助條約　爲期廿五年保證解除德國軍備　英法蘇同意加又討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十日廣播：美方建議四强外長會議應討論四强訂立佔領德國之二十五年互助條約問題，蘇聯方面已予以同意。在另一方面，美國對蘇方之意見，則亦將表示讓步。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎卅日電〕美國務卿員爾納斯昨夜宣佈，已提議英·法·蘇·美四國訂立互助條的，爲期廿五年，以保證解除德國軍備。是項建議，若經美參議院通過，並得英·法·蘇三國核准，則美國將於德國目前軍事佔領狀態終止後，仍以軍力參與維持歐洲安全，至少廿五年。貝爾納斯稱：去年耶誕節，彼曾在莫斯科與史達林討論四國條約事，史達林贊成此意，而彼本人亦具堅强信念，故已提出四國條約草案。貝氏在四國外長會議時提此建議，常時會議已決定將整個德國問題列入議程，且已開始磋商義大利殖民地處置辦法，歷五小時始畢。散會後貝氏接見新聞記者，詳述美國對德國及歐洲安全之遠大政策，條約草案規定四國對德國實施監督制度，確證德國軍隊，參謀總部及衝鋒隊，秘密警察等，已「完全解除武裝，復員及解散，且無軍事設備製造或輸入」。貝氏又稱：對於日本，亦已草擬同樣條約，提交太平洋各國，但尙未與各該國進行商討，故不願置評。惟有關德日兩國之四國條約，與對德對日和的，完全無關，聯合國憲章訂明，有權締結此種性質之協定，期滿後且可展長廿五年。英外相貝文及法外長畢杜爾均贊助貝氏建議，將此條約列入外長會議議程，蘇外長莫洛托夫則持異議，稱：會議應當討論整個德國問題，至於四國條約，未免言諸過早，不妨另組監督委員會，斷定德國解除武裝已至何種程度。貝文與貝爾納斯答以盟國管制德國委員會已在進行是項工作。貝爾納斯旋要求散會，四國條約問題，仍未解決。今晚會議，提出德國問題之前，先行聽取下列建議：</p>
<p>（一）立即准許利比亞獨立，並在非洲東北部成立新國家，由英國受託管理。</p>
<p>（二）蘇聯前曾要求受託管理北非洲的黎波里坦尼亞，現又提出妥洽辦法。</p>
<p>（三）聯合國機構安全理事會決定義大利殖民地之託管辦法。</p>
<p>（四）多得喀尼斯羣島交予希臘。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦卅日電〕英外交部發言人頃稱：美國建議四强締的，監督德國解除武裝，英國在原則上予以同意，但目前並未全力贊助，英國寗願將此事列入議程，作一般之討論。</p>
<h3>貝氏所提草約大要</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕貝爾納斯提出與各國訂立互助條約之草的，包括緒言及正文五條，條文大要如下。</p>
<p>第一條：各締約國應經由解除德國軍備，復員德國軍隊，及解散德國參謀部等方法，確保德國一切軍事團體之取締·製造並輸入戰爭材料及以任何工廠或實騐室供軍事用度之禁止。</p>
<p>第二條：四國對德管制委員會應在規定時期內實行視察，以監督上述條款之正確實施。</p>
<p>第二條：四締約國應各在其佔領區域內，確保德國之解除武裝，同時佔領德國之時期，須延長至德國接受第一及第二兩條時爲止。</p>
<p>第四條：四締約國當經由管制委員會隨時通達消息，俾遇德國違反條約時，得以採取行動。本條約於簽字六閱月以後，四簽的國應宣布留駐何項軍隊以維護各項條款之施行。</p>
<p>第五條：本條約於簽字後生效，其有效時期爲廿五年。</p>
<h3>處置義殖民地問題　四國未能獲協議　德國問題決列入議程</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕四强外長會議今晚會議，歷五小時之久，對於處分義大利屬地問題，未能成立協定，但已將全部德國問題列入議程。今日會議首討論議程中最嚴重之處分義大利殖民地及控制地中海東部問題，特里埃斯特與義大利南斯拉夫邊界問題在議程中列爲第二案，定本星期二討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎卅日電〕四國外長會議昨晚開會時，關於義殖民地之處置，英蘇之立塲，已與去年九月倫敦會議時大不相同，貝爾納斯重申去年九月在倫敦宣布之計劃，主張義殖民地應交國際托管。莫洛托夫繼稱：蘇聯現建議的黎波里坦尼亞及西倫奈加應由聯合國機構治理，惟的黎波里坦尼亞應設蘇聯行政長官一人，義大利副長官一人，輔以由英美法代表各一人及當地居民代表二人合組之咨詢機構。各外長相繼發言後，會議仍無決議，昨日之會議，並曾討論多得喀尼斯羣島及德奧問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕聞貝文已自倫敦携來不列顚帝國對於的黎波里及其他義大利屬地，多得喀尼斯羣島與地中海不列顚帝國生命綫之全部方針，英國反對蘇聯要求托管義大利屬地，自與史末資談話後，其態度益趨堅强。</p>

<h3>管制日本委會　我代表提議設四小組會</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京三十日電〕四國對日管制委會今晨開會，討論日本糧食問題，美代表艾其森直率宣稱，美國是否應運糧至他國而不應運送至日本，此一問題完全不屬於委員會權限之內。下午繼續開會，討論農村改革案，日敎育制度，及日政府如何執行麥帥總部命令等，歷兩小時，會議順利進行，頗覺風平浪靜。先是，中國代表朱世明，提議組機軍事，政治，經濟及敎育四小組會。英蘇代表均表贊同，但艾其森宣布對此項小組會之工作（或將具有調査性質），並不「完全贊回」。</p>

<h3>瞎子看電影　主演者用口解釋緊張處手舞足蹈</h3>
<p>〔聯合社好萊塢二十九日電〕愛德華阿諾近來拍完了一部影片，片名呌做「隱藏着的眼睛」，他在裏面飾一位瞎眼偵探，這已是關於瞎眼偵探的第二部影片了。愛德華阿諾說：我拍究了這都影片，才想起來很可以放映影片，來慰勞那些失明的軍人。起初醫院裏的人都懷疑瞎子如何可以看影戲，但等我解釋以後，他們才點頭稱善。愛德華阿諾說：影戲開演之後，我即用口來解說銀幕上所放演的地方，因爲觀衆都是看不見的瞎子。至於一部份影星的聲調，軍人們以前看過影戲，當然也還耳熱，不致聽不出來。當影戲演到緊張的時候，他們甚至用脚和手杖來敲地板，演過之後，還表示希望能够再享受這種影戲。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾　抨撃工黨政府</h3>

<h3>新新公司總經理　李澤案七日宣判　被告謂無一點封不起良心國家章陳兩律師出許辯護詞鋒銳利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動全滬之新新公司總經理李澤案，昨日下午在高院臨時刑庭四度開審，旁聽席上全部客滿，即走道上亦擠得水洩不通。三時正，劉毓桂庭長會同邱煥　·曹駿二推事開合議庭，宣佈更新審理。提李澤到案。檢舉人舒月橋。韓武城。姚卓人。葉秋彬四人均到庭，經劉庭長一一詢問後，陳霆銳·章士劍兩律師即爲李澤辯護，詞鋒銳利，直至六時二十分，始由劉庭長宣吿辯論終結，定五月七日下午二時宣判。茲誌其詳情如下：</p>
<p>昨日李澤到庭時，衣靑灰色夾袍，着黃色皮鞋，戴一副黑邊眼鏡，昂然闊步而入。當聽畢　記官宣讀上次筆錄後，即曰：「我沒有話說」。及書記官讀畢上次檢舉人庭訊筆錄，經舒月橋等確認無誤，並按序簽字後，李即開始辯稱：（一）關於僞商統會者，供稱，該會完全由僞實業部發動，一切發起人，籌備委員及理監事等，完全由偽府內定，未在事先徵求同意。而當時係被敵偽壓迫，不能不尤爲理事。商統會本身，亦爲「被動機關」，各義上統轄所有物資統制會，總攬一切，統制物資之權，但各物統會負責人，全由僞行政院直接指派，固不能負物統之責，至紗布收買事，爲日本軍部與僞行政院決定辦理，當時理事長唐籌民曾力爭不辦，但迫於敵勢，卒不果。惟經商統會之努力，已改變收買辦法，使「减輕商民痛苦」。其效果爲：一，絲麻不在收買之例，二，棉紗拆包不收買，三，廠家所用三月之貨不收買，商店所需一月存貨不收買。在唐壽民手中，僅有棉紗布六十餘件被日軍拿去。聞蘭亭接收後，更不曾予日人以一紗一布。（二）關於新新公司職工聘日人伊藤爲顧問事，李澤答稱：日人曾欲以一千萬元代價收買該公司未果，後欲改爲中日合辦，亦不得逞·及太平洋戰爭爆發，日人藉勢滋擾，無以自安，遂請日本顧問對付之，以保公司財產，維護同人安全。（三）關於獻廢鐵供敵軍用事，李澤堅稱，爲賣予森大者，有票據賬册爲證，人證。物證。俱在，故不多言。</p>
<p>惟舒月橋則謂：民國廿五年間，正當抵制日貨最烈之時，李澤赴日購貨，更向海關偸稅，其人格已不足道，而彼所言，俱爲强辯。所提證據，亦屬虛僞云云。韓武城稱：李澤所舉商統會務旣詳細若是，可知其必負實際責任者，故要求庭上早日宣判。李澤聞言，乃日，彼並無一點對不起良心，對不起國家，吾則願受最嚴厲的制裁，故亦深願早日結束是案。</p>
<p>劉廷長遂諭開始辯論，數檢察官榮鐸乃起立宣佈李澤罪狀二點：（二）僞商統會之性質，，乃以「中國人出面辦事，較日人更爲便利』之原則，代替日軍部統制經濟之任務。其主要工作爲：一，華東物資之收置與支配，二，物資移動之統制，三，華中華南華北物資交換與貿易統制，四，工廠物資之管理，五，軍需物資之管理。此稱工作，皆於敵有利，於民有害，而李澤自籌備至終了，皆參預其事，其罪自明。（二）戰爭期內，敵軍需用鋼鐵甚急，李澤竟以大量水汀由日黃色軍用車裝運資敵，故應照漢奸懲治條例第二條第一項第四款及第三條二項五款治罪。劉庭長問李澤，還有話說嗎？答：「他的話全是理想，庭長應請依照事實判定。」於是李澤退入旁座，雙手交叉胸前，昻首環視。</p>
<p>陳霆銳律師於開庭之始，曾遞呈設物三件，即軍統局。忠救軍與難民救濟會之公函，證明李澤確屬於國有功，其辯論稱：『中國現在最需要法治，無法治即不能存中國，法是　的清神，所以我要爲李澤辯護。」又謂檢舉人僅有口頭不確實之證言，被吿倒有人證物證，故所控之罪不能成立，應請判無罪。章士釗律師繼起辯護，以歷史實例與法理參通互證，證明被吿應判無罪。最後，由李澤補充云：「如果蔣主席認我是漢奸，我便是漢奸，吾則，我決不承認。」至此，劉庭長遂宣吿辯論終結，定五月七日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<h3>章律師辯　要點</h3>
<p>又掌律師之辯授要點：略　　　起訴書所指，不出兩點：一，被吿曾任僞商統會理事，一，公司會出售舊永汀資敵。此類案件，可討論者，不遇三事：（一）犯意，（二）環境，（三）行爲。被吿適充百貨業領袖，以位　故，被指派爲僞商統會理事，名職雖與市民·保長有大小廣狹之不同，而其束縛馳聘於僞制置則一。被吿身居全面論胥之上海，環境特殊，不能與大後方漢奸同例。而被吿之於偽商統會，不過名義上之　　，不務實事；身在處中，心存　　，遇有地下工作可實報稱。拯救·獻貲者，慮無不竭其力，能之所至，九死不　一生而爲之。當　軍計劃登陸上海陵園，　告與　等劍　接濟物資團，財力之鉅，乃至三十萬萬，此事統計調査局與委員長代表公署曾嘉許請獎。並爲浦東忠救軍籌餉　一萬萬五千萬元，足證被吿赤心內向，潛謀救國而有餘。綜觀被吿犯意泯焉不存，環境實　處此，行爲又昭昭然，適得奸　之反。國防最高委員諸公手定法條，三者幷明著於　，各有指歸，爰主張被吿無罪。</p>
<p>為車票加價今日實行</p>
<p>京滬區鐵路管理局，曾作調整客運及貨運價格之提議，現已獲得交部允准。其新辦法係根據以三等基層數，每一公里三元者，塲加三倍計算，新價目公佈如次：「普通車，上海至南京，頭等一萬五千六百元，二等七千八百元，三等三千九百元。特快車，上海至南京頭等一萬八千八百元，二等九千四百元，三等四千七百元。臥車，上海至南京，原訂一萬六千元者，現减爲一萬元。上海至杭州，普通車頭等九千二百元，二等四千六百元，三等二千三百元。特快車，頭等一萬〇八百元，二等五千四百元，三等二千七百元。以上新價目，一律於今日起實施。至於交部所頒佈貨運新價格，據該局負責人稱：此項新運價，正在硏究核定中，惟與原價距離甚近，一俟擬就再予公佈云。</p>

<h3>大會務須如其召開　速謀解決國是</h3>
<p>留滬國大肛表發表共同宣言</p>
<p>國民大會各地民選代表，先後來滬，相互交換意見，發表共同宣言略云：（一）召開國民大會，亦國父建國一貫之主張，乃挾有武力之黨派，藉口要挾，緩開國民大會，割據政權，分裂國家。政府爲促進和平，委曲求全，但遷延數月，局勢越惡，故非如期召開國民大會，依全國人民之公意，速謀國是之解決不可。（二）政府召開國民大會，旣已緩無可緩，最後復依協商方式，定於本年五月五日舉行，今竟因少數黨派之私意，變更法令，同人等恭受人民之付託，亟應予以糾正。（三）民國成立，今已卅五年，而奠定國家長治久安之根本大法，猶付關如，野心思逞之徒，因無共循法度，更可假籍口實，淆亂是非，故宜即開國民大會，制定憲法，實現民主，按憲政常軌，選賢任能，由人民嚴密監督，使權能確實劃分，以保國家之統一，而促永久之和平不可。（四）同人等與國家民族同其安危，故不能不促起政府及各黨派之最後警覺。同人等爲尊重民意，維持國家大信於不墜，具體意見，已如前述，現爲達成使命，決定按期赴會，義無返顧，以期無負於國民付託。</p>

<h3>視察江蘇教育張督學回部復命</h3>
<p>上海中學校舍設備俱佳</p>
<p>地方敎育因免田賦費絀</p>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕敎部督學張　翔，前次奉命視察江蘇敎育，一月有餘，已於二十九日回京向敎部復命。據開張督學視察鎭江，蘇州，崑山，南通等地中小學敎育，及上海省立中學及小學，記者叩以視察印象，承吿如次：</p>
<p>省立學校　以省立上海中學校舍，在戰前於龍華建築新舍，規模宏大，比之南開大學，殆將過之。在陷期因改爲英美僑民集中營，故房舍十之七八皆完整。其工廠設備，因工科主任能設法避免敵僞目標，遷置得法，得以保全。戰前向歐美訂置機器，於戰時到達，至今尙原封未動。故該校設備，如繼續整理規復，前途必有相當發展。至鎭江，蘇州，各中學與師範，職業各校之校舍，多所破壞，一時元氣難復，雖有一億七千萬之敎育復員經費，而省敎育機關五十單位，分配多在修綫，難敷建復。</p>
<p>地方教育　因本年豁免田賦，地方敎育經費困難，以致敎員生活補助費僅二萬四千（鎭江），乃至一萬六千（崑山），底薪僅照七十倍計算，不敷生活，學校惟有收雜費，或補助金，每生自一千至三千允，以資挹注，此事於法容有未合，於情實非得已。各生家長幸能體諒此情教員尙能堅苦度其生活，嚴守崗位，　師資資格，不無發生問題，除南通方面，因在前張　通倡辦師範多校，師資充裕，至今通邑小學，仍多合格之師範生外，鎭江因距首都較近，師範舉　生之能力充分者，多已趨往鄰邑就待遇較高之事業，影響師資，稍欠整齊，爲以後敎育着想，敎師待遇，亟應護法提高云。</p>
<h3>皖教育廳通令各縣加強簡師學生實習</h3>

<h3>法國教育革新計劃</h3>
<p>— 胡品清譯</p>
<p>今日法國的特　，是深切而　誠的求革新的願望，在人們討論的一切事項中，有一項是關於教育問題：『我們的屋子陷在大火了，但是有一件傢俱需要搶救，那便是孩子們的智能。」我們常常愛說法國中學和大學是製造傻子和寄生虫的工廠，然而事實上，法國學校的畢業生並非不如旁人，這是因爲法國人歡喜自貶，不滿現實，冀能達到盡善盡美的地步。</p>
<p>如今人們在敎育方面有一個新的槪念，經過兩次戰爭以後，法國人深知須要物盡其用，人盡其才。</p>
<p>因此郞之萬教授等已於二月間向制　會議呈上一個敎育革新計劃，其要旨爲使每個靑年能有機會儘量發展他的才能，並推行各級的義務敎育。</p>
<p>在敎育革新計劃中，有一點最重大的，是　除傳統的學位制度。這種學位，是結束了中等敎育的表記，因爲這種制度弊端甚多，一個青年爲了要應付得學位的考試，便經常在恐懼中生活，他們只管埋頭苦讀，以致失云思想和好廳心，這種中等教育制度，不僅阻止智力的天然發展，而且很不公平，因爲在修業期滿的時候，考試是在校內舉行，而且主考人是深知學生的教師</p>
<p>原來的制度，是中學畢業以後便能直接升入大學，無須考試。但是一般人都覺得剛畢業的中學生程度不够，所以郎之萬主張在大學裹設施一種「三級」制。中學生轉入「三級」時，需要參加入學考試。「三級」中的學生有一部份是凖備升入高等師範學校和諸藝學校的，另一部份則升入普通大學。大學畢業考試，不由各校分別舉行，而由全國各大學統一考試。</p>
<p>最後是「四級」，也就是眞正的高等敎育，只有少數的大學才有四級敎育，目的在造就科學人才。四級敎育，注重智力的天然發展，設有考試和學位的限制。</p>
<p>這便是郞之萬敎育革新計劃的要點，其主旨在發展學生的思想和智力，使他們不受課本和考試的限制。</p>

<h3>中行無限制供給　金價漲後轉平　較前收回跌九萬元　配給價改為一八五</h3>
<p>烚赤昨投機家孤注一擲，竟使中行貝總裁陷於苦戰狀態，配給一一八〇條，價則提升至一八五萬，投機心理初步大功告成，以為前途無限，借金玩股者見勢不佳，間起軋空，以至十時後竟喊至二〇〇萬高價，造成新記錄，中行處此危機下，不得不施展最后法寶，聲言開一八五萬配給價，繼續續行登記，無限制供給，潮漫之漲風，始告改觀，而告回跌，見機者一部份出籠，幾幾乎以低價結束，火爆熱烈之形勢亦漸趨平淡，晨開仍抬高至一九〇萬大關外，開後自一九四萬逐漸回跌，十時左右在一八三萬至一八六萬間掙扎，中行配給價揭曉，提升至一八五萬，買戶相當滿意，一般拋金購股者，瀕於絕境，深恐中行敗下陣來，演成步步高昇，多方有機可乘，全力一逞，迫成軋空局面，遂在配給後俄頃之間躍升至一九七萬以上新高峰，有等急切抵補者，竟有在二百萬之價成交者，中行至此壓力一再加重，冀挽狂瀾於旣倒，始起回風，一方面更傳出中行可以繼續以一八五萬原價，當日無限制供給，趾高氣揚之多頭，始感打緊，不敢再為所欲為，同時晨初較鬆動之銀根，此後亦逐步趨緊，以致脫手者轉股，午刻曾回挫至一八〇萬以內，始稍回穩，無如回升力較弱，此後難逾配給價，多方續有了結，午後又繼續疲落至一七五萬以下，結果較前收回跌九萬，飾金掛十九萬元，紋銀江北銷路復殷，升為一千八，銀元一千一左右，暗拆銀根飄忽，息價自一角六至二角，午後更為混亂，竟有喊高至二角以外者。</p>
<h3>公債續小　投機性顯豁呈露</h3>
<p>公債趨勢步華股後塵，遊資退出，趨向黃金，以致中途一度欲漲而欠後勁，終以低價結束，統丙晨開六一〇〇元，開后步升至六八〇〇元，游資移往黃金，以致多方連袂脫手，午刻遂跌至五六〇〇元，結果較前收續跌五五〇元，甲乙丁戊時間關係，祇挫二五〇元。</p>
<h3>美鈔追隨金市　結果軋低二百</h3>
<p>美鈔不若黃金之鋒利，聞近日中行對求結美匯者，手續簡而批復快，進口商正當申請，結款便利，不合格之貨物亦稍形沈靜，以致美鈔全隨金市轉移，對黃金亦拔開至七二五元對十兩矣，晨開自二七〇〇元退至二五五〇，買戶逢低維持，金價間接助威，十時後復漲到二七五〇元，迨金市變色，午刻遂破入二五〇〇元內，入後雖有些微之掙扎，無奈金價已一再回落，終以低價結束，結果較前收回跌二百元，港票由穩而疲回跌十五元，港電羅比微挫五元，美匯掛牌仍平。</p>
<h3>現棉交易進展</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報跌八至十三磅音，計近期美金二七·七六，遠期二七·九〇，米特林現貨二八·四一，本埠現棉交易又見進展，民營紗廠如鴻章及申新第一六兩廠均有採辦，共成交一千二三百包，市價以籽花最為緊俏，獨升三千五百元云。</p>
<h3>烟煤屑漸活躍</h3>
<p>烟煤屑外埠客帮搜購仍殷，交易漸呈活躍，尤以開平二號　浦東棧單最為熱門，成交價為十六萬元及十六萬五千元之間，而上海現貨價仍僅十七萬元，白煤鴻基中塊續有七千噸自安南運來，現正卸貨駛運中，又民生煤管理處平資民生炊事用白煤事現已辦理結束，當時定額五千噸，現尚有一千餘噸，關餘煤將配售煤業服務同業，價較平　價尤廉，故白煤市價恐再有下跌之勢。</p>
<h3>紗市大漲大落</h3>
<p>昨日纱市狂漲暴跌，最初承上日　漲之餘威，直綫上升，廿支　馬曾至一百三十八萬新高峯，十六支光明亦跳到一百十萬從不旋踵間同行獲利，相繼吐售，前者乃回降至一百廿六七萬，後者回到一百〇二三萬，反動之烈，為近數日中所罕見，各支紗綫以當日低價收市，結果與昨日行市相仿，無大出入，成交雖不見夥，尚稱穩定。</p>
<h3>食糖大漲小回</h3>
<p>昨糖市以連日步漲過甚，實銷見呆，間有回出者，因此市勢轉平，公會劃盤上午初為六萬九千元，旋至六萬八千元，七千元，六千元，最後稍振為六萬七千五百元，及上午趨勢仍平，為六萬六千元至七千元，均為公會棧單，比前日小二三千元，其他客貨亦有回鬆。</p>
<h3>南北貨市勢回振</h3>
<p>南北貨疲軟已久，近以其他物價回漲，因亦隨升，如桂元前後已升萬餘元，昨興化元更出十萬大關，龍口粉升至九萬元，高統手元棗呌四萬五千元，新椿芽頭水貨小數曾開二十萬元，近到較多，現為十四萬元，涪陵榨七萬二千元。</p>
<h3>糧貸米另候處置　米價在高峯站定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨米市場已恢復交易，秩序良好，價格堅定，每担約四萬二千左右，交易尚旺，據該市場負責人告記者，昨日到米之向該處登記者，約五千担，米貸金所購之米，將不交市場，逕付各米店應門市需要，惟昨日糧政特派員辦公處，尚未收到該項米糧，故發售恐尚需時日，糧政特派員辦公處昨在米市場發貼調字十一號佈告：自卽日起，所有貸款糧商購到之米，應由本處會同市臨時參議會市商會社會局審核規定出售辦法後，再為公告云。</p>
<p>昨日米市來源尚可，店胃平平，午時胃呆少神，暫無榮辱可言，須看明市變化轉移，麵粉狂跌之後，店胃略取，回升三四百元，惟雜牌粉仍平，油市依然軟化，繼疲五六百至千元不一，麩皮再小二三百元，豆餅步降三四百元，黃豆客帮停辦，本街揀高抬取，市形提高殺次，高貨平站，中下者下挫二千餘元，尚乏交易生仁彷佛，紅糧價小千餘元而無受主，苞米亦低一二千元，各糧高峯已過，趨入盤旋之狀。</p>
<h3>美貨紛紛進口　小麥…水菓…鐵絲</h3>
<p>天祥洋行太平洋號，戰後第一次來滬，由美運來桔子等水果九千餘箱，鐵絲四百五十噸，香烟紙二百餘箱，運雜貨共計約五千四百餘噸，又取來公司　脫庫拉號，由美裝來麥子八千餘噸，昨午已抵吳淞口，昨晚如不及進口，今晨定可駛入浦江，預定停三十九四十號浮商起卸過　。</p>
<h3>粵米新盤　每石六萬八千　平價辦法失效</h3>
<p>〔聯合社廣州廿九日電〕天雖下雨有助農作，但此間米市今日已飛漲至每石六萬八之新高價。一切平價措置均歸無效，民生方面將發生嚴重影響。</p>
<h3>皮革市況穩定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕製革事業為四大輕工業之一，溯自抗戰勝利以還，國內製革廠商，由於製造原料之缺乏，開支之浩大，成本　重，而歐美皮革又復絡續進口，其價格反較低廉，致國產皮革頓遭莫大打擊，甚多賠本推銷，廠商維持，倍感不易，茲悉歐美製革原料刻有大量湧到，用以製革，成本減輕，不致再遭虧損，爰是近日皮革市況漸趨穩定。</p>
<h3>蠶絲市場　將為人絲所奪　英美人見解不同</h3>
<p>〔路透社麥克來斯麥爾三十日電〕美國方面人士最近表示一種意見，認為戰前之蠶絲市場已永遠為人造絲所奪，并以為蠶絲茍能在西方市場繼續立足，則應趕速利用目前織物之缺乏。但英國絲商並不表示同意。此間製造商指出，第一次大戰後亦有此同樣之臆測，當時人造絲尚係初次發展，然在一九二四年至一九三九年間蠶絲之消耗量增加七倍之多。據此間某商行當局宣稱，牛酪與人造牛酪亦同此情形，市民購買後者，乃因其較多，而非因其較廉之故。同樣，茍蠶絲之產量相當豐富而價格公道，則市民甯取蠶絲而棄人造絲，乃勢所必然也云。</p>
<h3>游資偏向金市場　華洋股均見疲落</h3>
<p>華股雖有蠢動，無如投機力量吃重於黃金，力有未逮，不得已繼續脫股換金，同時金市飛黃騰達，借金玩股者，被逼急補，在此雙管齊下之情況下，籌碼終於見鬆，開后曾起回漲，永紗最高六一〇〇元，美亞五一〇〇元，景福五〇五元，新光四四〇元，勤興三四五元，嗣後遂陷入逐步退縮之局面中，近午低價永紗五六〇〇元，美亞四七〇〇元，景福四六五元，新光三九五元，勤興三一五元，而後稍平，午收較前收計三首熱平平，新光勤興信和中紡大中華榮豐均告微隆，一部份玩股者趨向小型老股，擇賤而取，中法內衣兩者，遂有人搜羅而告漲，新亞則因主事者遠離，未能一視同仁，元老股續有進展，外股情形亦不能例外，游資亟向祇補黃金一途流去，怡紗曾破一五大關，結果較前收各挫半成左右，後市零星之喊價，華洋各股稍見扳高。</p>
<h3>茶市轉蘇</h3>
<p>奄奄一息之茶市，昨日市上漸見甦醒，蓋陳貨花色，除蘇州帮暗中續在吸收，天津各地胃納亦有加強之勢，同時本街店莊亦有零星銷路，價格方面，徘徊不動，茲據津帮消息，對於綠花茶，不日擬展開巨胃，儘量暢收，至於新龍井，到源不斷，惟市氣則跟蹤告定，但成交行情，以品質參差，猶比上日為小。</p>
<h3>絲綢又見軟弱</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲市價動盪　定，終致下挫，一二〇號天橋一百八十萬元開盤，一百七十七萬元收盤，中途曾喊過八十二萬元，下午更小，做一百七十萬元，較隔日短十五萬元，廠絲八十一分高勻度洋行貨，做開價二百五十八萬元，餘皆平平，不過人心頗覺軟弱，綢貨昨市各貨均稍提高，美亞被面每百條高四萬元，大誠格子壁縐每碼大三十元。</p>
<h3>桐油市況稍堅</h3>
<p>近週來各物均趨漲勢，獨桐油依舊，雖人心稍見堅挺，然總不敵漢市之疊電報跌，蓋前日接漢口來電，謂白桐油已跌，聞五萬零五百元，形勢仍屬不振，以此而論，杭市縱見緊俏，因到稀之故，若來源稍有，仍須見平也，申行現售白桐油每市担七萬二千元，西副洪江油每桶八萬五千元，本地洪油六萬元。</p>
<h3>呢羢定貨將到</h3>
<p>呢羢市面昨仍平疲，除應時之各檔夏白貨稍有零星賣買外，餘無相當交易，標準行情，大部份絕少變動，最初所定之外貨，由寶達洋行傳出消息，旬日內將可次第到申，因此業中訂貨者，均在購買美金票，聞所裝到之貨品，大半均係秋冬需銷之　貨云。</p>
<h3>春繭貸款二百億　擬收乾繭八萬担　值美金二三千萬</h3>
<p>四行聯合總處，所辦之蠶繭貸款，經宋院長批准為二百億元，並指定是項貸款，除中國，交通，中國農民三行辦理外，得邀同中信儲匯兩局，及上海各商業銀行組織銀團分額貸與，并由銀團會同中國蠶絲公司合組本年春蠶管理處，分派幹員赴各繭區，嚴密監督是項貸款之核放收回稽核及押品管理等項，以妨是項貸款移作別用，聞收繭業務，則由中蠶公司會同各廠在各該產區辦理，至收繭之價格，則以繭農之實際成本，再加合法利潤計算，俾使繭農能受此繭價上之實惠，以為鼓勵農村業之生產。</p>
<p>該貸款管理處并為求減輕廠商製造成本起見凡廠方所需之燃煤擬由該處商請燃料當局予照官價配給，據聞中蠶公司將負製造技術方面之指導責任，俾提高各廠生絲品質，倘有病蠶害之繭，一概不予收購，并即焚燬，以妨摻雜，而維持標準品質。</p>
<p>繭汛期屆，該銀團正積極籌組，日內即可成立，開貸管處擬在五月上旬開始執行業務，本年該處所擬收繭數額，為乾繭八萬担（即鮮繭廿四萬担），據絲業界稱，此八萬担乾繭，可缫生絲一萬七千担至二萬担，（每担絲之成本原料加工費等，約值二百五十萬，滬價現為二百七十萬（指八十三分者），以目前紐約絲市羣絲八十三分者，每磅司售十一元五角至十二元，約共可售得二三千萬元（美金），故此項貸款核放后，對充實外匯基金來源，不　裨益。</p>

<h3>不可避免的白人（續）</h3>
<p>— Jack　London原著　魯莽譯</p>
<p>『水手中的四個，連薩克思多夫在內，是在洗擦船尾甲板的　杆。那第五個水手，手中執着來福槍，是站在正靠近主桅下端的注水器在守望。我是要給前斜帆架注一些水。正在我走前去取注水管的時候，我聽得岸上一聲槍聲。我站直了在望着。什麽束西擊在我的後腦上，幾乎使我暈了過去，而把我擊倒在甲板上。我立即想到是在出了什麼事情；可是就在我被擊倒在甲板上的以前，我聽得那划子上的來福槍聲，而急旋轉頭，我只瞥到一眼那站着在守望的水手。兩個大黑人在執着他的臂膀，而還有一個黑人是在從後面用一柄戰斧向他的腦袋劈下去。</p>
<p>『我現在還能看得狠淸楚，那注水器，那主桅，那緊執着他的一羣，那向他的後腦劈下去的斧頭，以及炫耀在太陽光下的一切。我正是在幻想到那死亡。那戰斧似乎過了一個非常長久的時間才劈下。我是看它劈下來的，而那水中的腿便屈着蹲了下去。那兩個黑人用力把他扶直了，他又被斫兩斧。於是我在頭上也再被斫了兩斧，而一定以爲我是死了。那樣斫我的渾蛋也一定這樣以爲。我是一些移動的力量都沒有，而躺在那裏看他們把那守望者的頭割下來。我得說他們做得　敏捷。他們是做這種事情的老手。</p>
<p>『划子上的來福槍已停止了，我確得定他們的子彈已盡，而什麽都完結了。他們會回來斫我的頭只是時間問題。他們顯然是在船尾上割取水手的頭。人頭在馬拉伊達是寳貴的，尤其白人的人頭。它們在鹹水土人的獨木舟屋中有它們尊敬的位子。叢林土人從它們獲得什麼特別裝飾的效果，我不知道，可是他們正像戲水土人一樣地寳貴它們。</p>
<p>『我有一個糢糊的逃走的意向，我便用我的手和滕蓋爬到了絞車的邊頭，在這裏我設法使我自己落了起來。從那裏我望得到船尾，而看到在艙的頂上有三顆頭—那是幾個月來一直在接受我命令的水手的頭。黑人看見我站起來了，即向我衝過來。我伸手去取我的手槍，而發覺他們已把它取去了。我不能說我是恐懼。我已鄰近過死亡好幾次，可是似乎從沒有過一次比這一次更鄰近的。我是半暈眩的，似乎什麼事都沒有關係。</p>
<p>『那領頭的黑人以船上廚房中的一柄屠刀爲武器，而在他預備把我所倒的時候，他打着像猩猩一樣的醜臉。可是這所從沒有被完成。他突然跌倒在甲板上，我便看到血在從他嘴裏湧出來。我隱約聽得有一支來福槍在開，而且繼續在開。黑人一個接連一個地跌倒了。我的意識開始淸楚了，我便注意到沒有一槍不開中的。來福槍每開一次，就有一個■人跌倒。我坐下在甲板上，在絞車的旁邊，而向上望着。躲在桅頂橫桁上的是薩克思多夫。他怎麼會這樣躱了上去的，我眞想像不出，因爲他是隨帶了兩支溫哲斯脫來福槍上去的，而子彈帶有多少我却不知道；而現在他是在做着在這世界上他所適合做的唯一的事情。</p>
<p>『我看見開槍與屠殺，可是像他那樣開槍我却從沒有看見過。我坐在絞車旁，而望着那個景象。我是軟弱而有些暈眩，這似乎完全是一塲夢。砰，砰，砰，砰，開着他的來福槍，朴，朴，朴，朴，黑人跌倒在甲板上。看他們跌下去是有些驚異的。在他們向我衝來以後，已跌倒了大約有一打人，他們似乎麻痺了；可是他從不停止扳他的槍。在這個時候許多獨木舟和兩隻划子從海岸開了過來，佩帶了後瞠槍，還佩帶了溫哲斯脫來福槍，這是他們從那兩隻划子攫取了來的。他們一齊向着薩克思多夫急速開槍眞是非同小可的。（未完）</p>
<h3>二展觀感</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>一·上海美術作家協會第一届聯展</p>
<p>繪畫，是利用某一種媒材來表現作老的感情，思想和想像。媒材的選擇，只是一種表現的必要手段，決不是機械地確定本國境內只應該用毛筆水墨與宣紙來描繪，別的都是標新立異。這樣的說法，我們可以在上月廿二日起大新畫廊舉行的上海美術作家協會第一届聯展做證明的。</p>
<p>上海美術作家協會諸君，他們各人用各人所愛用的器材，來製作繪畫，所謂國畫，油畫，水彩，素描，木刻，漫畫，圖案都有。我們並不覺得除了國畫之外都感到不適宜，相反地，我們可以看到每一個作者是在精選媒材，謹愼地運用媒村，以求得表現藝術的效果。</p>
<p>第一届聯展之中，我們又可明晰地分出藝術傾向的兩大類型，一種是從內地回滬的作家的作品，充滿了現實的氣氛，另一種是抗戰期中滯滬的作家，則是在做表現技法的功夫。</p>
<p>前者，因爲體騐了實際的生活，使繪畫的內容絕對摒除幻想的成分，同時，他們的作品之中，我們更値得注意的，是一種揚棄了國畫洋畫之後的新表現技法的確立，有堅勁綿密的綫，也有陰陽晦明的光和色，更有宏厚壯麗的氣概，這不僅可以國畫，洋畫，木刻……等名詞來稱它，似乎是已達上創造之途的一種新興的民族繪畫。因爲內容的接近現實，或者，以新寫實主義繪畫這個名詞來稱它，是相當適合吧。這未始不是抗戰給予藝術的新生命。抗戰期中滯滬作家的作品，如果只以內容一點來和前者並比，大部分的作品是感到不够的，但是技法上的修養，畢竟是藝術表現的重要因素，那麽，原諒他們生活範圍的無法擴大，以精湛優秀技法構成的作品，我們也應該注意的。</p>
<p>二·張乃　油畫個展</p>
<p>八仙橋靑年會展出的張乃　君的油畫，是走着技法硏究的一條大道，正也是走着二十世紀初頭歇洲新興繪畫所走的路，從藝術研究的態度上說，不走死板·呆滯的形骸的描寫的路，未始不是正確而可喜的。</p>
<p>哲人尼采曾經區分藝術爲兩大類型的對立，即Apollo型與Dionysus型的對立，前者是表示理智的，後者則是感情的，塞尙（Cezanne），特郞（Edrain），畢加莎（Picasso，諸人是可納入于前一個類型，而馬蒂斯Matisse），佛拉芒克（Vlaminck便屬于後一個類型的作家，前者，往往經過嚴密的思考來構成作品，後者，往往是剎那感情的表現，因此，理智型的藝術是重於形，感情型是偏於色的。</p>
<p>張君因爲具有可貴的天才，敏銳的感覺，與豐富的感情，因之，他的作品，往往是傾向于色的獨特構成而成爲即興的作品，借國畫家的說法，便是：「何謂發於無意者，常其凝神注想，流盼運腕，初不意如是而忽如是，謂之足，則實未足，謂之不足，則又無可增加，獨得於筆情墨趣之外，蓋天機之勃露也」。——張庚「浦山論畫」，所以應該納入於感情的類型中去。「大理花」，王蘭，「河上樹」，等等，確是一個明證。</p>
<p>無奈張君只致力于色彩與用筆上，造形感的把握，似乎尙嫌不够，我們希望張君多做一點素描的研究，尤其是人體構成描寫的硏究。假如不欲否定藝術應該接近現實的話，那麼，堅强的造形感，加上了足够的色彩與用筆，有了這樣的表現效果，庶幾成爲最優秀的繪畫了。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（三一）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>自從墨老爺去世，墨家便太平了！</p>
<p>墨太太不再有人和她吵架了，在這個家裏，不再有一件東西使她討厭或憎恨！生活平靜得反而使他有時感到寂寞，也許還稍微感到點不安。這不安，是由於她心裹明白，墨老爺的病是因他而起；病中，她又不曾盡絲毫的看護責任；甚而死後，起初她述眼淚都不流一滴；還是爲了看見孩子們哭得傷心，她才啜泣過幾次。但，這種心情，她是絕不肯對任何人說的。而且口頭上，還不斷數落着墨老爺生前如何如何的對不起她。由於這些怨言，又引起了孩子們的不滿，有一次寳鈴就向她抗議了，說：『爸爸千不好萬不好，如今他已經死了，就別再緊直數落他了！』寳鈴的話，相當讓她羞慚！她知道迎孩子們都不能原諒她對墨老爺的冷淡。爲着她要攏絡孩子們的感情，她從此便避免提起墨老爺。她一面悄悄地向墨老爺懺悔，一面集中精力整頓家務。</p>
<p>孩子們失去了墨老爺，一個個像迷了途的羔羊。特別是麗華，她只要一拿起書本兒來，就想哭！「女兒經」還沒有念完，墨老爺就離開了她！沒有人再敎她了，寳鈴在家的時候少，而且不像墨老爺那樣的有恒心，也不及墨老爺講解得淸楚。加之墨太太不許她念書，要她和麗雲一道兒學女紅，於是她便從此和書本絕了緣！這一切都使他不快活，使她深深哀念着墨老爺！</p>
<p>寳鈴初級中學快畢業了，原先墨老爺在世的時候，曾經答應他，無論如何要讓他初中畢了業升高中。高中畢了業，就等於前淸時代的舉人，然後可以當敎員自立生活了。因爲墨老爺不願兒子步自己的後塵，所以他壓根兒沒有計劃讓寳鈴高中畢了業去作官。墨老爺的這種意思，寳鈴是了解的，七年前墨老爺的一段沉痛自白，一直牢牢鐫記在寳鈴的腦海裏，也深深影響了他。所以，他虔心地決定將來實現墨老爺的期望。但是，如今墨老爺死了！墨老爺和他自己的幻想，都變成了泡影！他不可能再升高中，墨太太已經表示過，初中念完，就不上學了。因爲沒有那麽多錢培養他，因此他亦不可能當敎員去，自然更談不上「作官」。但他將要做什麽去呢？他茫然得很！他也痛苦得很！所以自從墨老爺去世以後，早出晚歸，終天待在學堂裏。一則他想多多利用這個短促的敎育機會好好讀讀書；二則他怕回家，回到那個沒有了墨老爺的家！</p>

        <h1>1946 - n121</h1>
<h3>The National Government Officially Orders the Return to Nanjing on May 5th; Sichuan Experimental Zone Actively Plans for All Delegates to Fly to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The National Government decrees: The National Government, for the sake of prolonged warfare, moved to Chongqing in November of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. For the past eight years, thanks to the loyal and brave soldiers who have advanced dauntlessly and sacrificed heroically, and the officials and civilians nationwide who have endured hardship and struggled resolutely, and with the allied nations advancing together by sea and air and fighting shoulder to shoulder, we have finally brought the enemy to surrender and achieved a great victory. Now that the national territory has been recovered and is completely intact, although the task of resisting the war has been completed, the task of nation-building has become even heavier. The government has decided to triumphantly return to Nanjing on May 5th of this year to fulfill the expectations of the people. However, after the great war, the people's livelihood is difficult, and the national strength is depleted. It is urgently necessary to allow the people to rest and recuperate, restore vitality, work hard to build, and maintain the fruits of the war. It is hoped that the soldiers and civilians across the country will be of one heart and one mind, striving diligently from morning to night, so as not to betray the original aspiration of resisting the war and building the nation, and to realize the mission of the Three Principles of the People. Recalling these eight years, the enemy penetrated deeply, causing significant losses. If it were not for relying on the vast population of our western region and relying on its abundant land resources, how could we have laid the foundation for today's great victory? Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," is the root of national strength. Chongqing, with its strategic location encompassing the two rivers and controlling the north and south, was able to safely weather the crisis and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the nation will forever shine in the annals of history and never diminish. Now that the return to the capital is imminent and Zhongling [Nanjing] is in sight, recalling the difficulty of recovering the two capitals, we feel even more the importance of the relationship between Bashu [Sichuan]. The government previously issued an order in September of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] designating Chongqing as the auxiliary capital. Recently, it has designated Sichuan as a national construction experimental zone. Its system should be adopted, and its name and reality should be respected. The Executive Yuan is hereby instructed to supervise the relevant provincial and municipal governments to carefully plan and actively implement it, so that Sichuan will forever be the center of the country's stability and serve as a model for national construction. Great expectations are placed on this. This order.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Administration Lin Wei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs Liu Ling, Commander of the Military Police Zhang Zhen, and Director of the Personnel Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission Qian Zhuolun, returned to the capital from Chongqing by plane on the 30th. According to Generals Lin and Liu, who spoke to this newspaper's reporter, the return to the capital work of the Ministry of Military Administration and the Ministry of Military Affairs has come to an end, and they have officially begun work in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Administration Yu Dawei and Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau He Haoruo arrived in Nanjing by plane on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Deputy Secretary-General of the National Political Council Lei Zhen is scheduled to fly from Chongqing to Wuhan and then to Nanjing on May 1st to handle the matters of the National Political Council's return to the capital. All important staff members of the council are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on May 2nd, leaving only a few people in Chongqing to handle the concluding work.</p>
<h3>Marshall and His Wife Arrive in Nanjing; Said to Be Preparing for a Two- to Three-Month Stay; The Three-Person Group Consultations Will Continue</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall (see picture), accompanied by his wife, flew to Nanjing on a Constellation aircraft at 10:30 AM on the 30th and arrived at the Dajiaochang Airport at 3:25 PM. Those who came to welcome them included He Yingqin and his wife, Chen Cheng, Jiang Menglin and his wife, and Lieutenant General Gillen. After Marshall and his wife disembarked, Mayor Ma's wife, Shen Huilian, presented flowers to Mrs. Marshall. Marshall greeted the welcoming guests one by one and repeatedly expressed his thanks. He did not express any opinions to the journalists who came to visit, only saying that he would be staying in Nanjing for two to three months and that the US military headquarters would be moved to Nanjing in its entirety. The weather in Nanjing this morning was gloomy and hot. After Marshall's special plane took off from Chongqing, there was a brief shower in Nanjing, but as the Constellation aircraft approached the skies of Nanjing, the rain suddenly stopped and the clouds dissipated, and a moment of sunshine was seen. Marshall's facial expressions after disembarking did not give the journalists any indication, but insightful observers all said that Marshall's dignified and amiable appearance was as always, but tonight, on the soft grass of No. 5 Ninghai Road in quiet Nanjing, the light and peaceful laughter of this peace envoy was faintly heard. Marshall will wait for the Chairman to return to the capital (on May 2nd) before discussing the Northeast issue again. The situation has clearly told the reporters that only in peace and composure can this difficult and long year be spent to reach the shore of peace. Therefore, the National Assembly may have to be postponed beyond "July 7th."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] On the eve of the National Government's promulgation of the order to return to the capital, US Special Envoy Marshal George Marshall flew to the capital for the second time on the 30th. Marshal Marshall and his wife took a C-45 silver giant special plane to Nanjing at 10:30 AM (Chongqing time) on the 30th and arrived safely at Guanghuamen Airport at 3:15 PM. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin and his wife, Minister Chen Cheng and his wife, Director Zhou Zhirou, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin and his wife, Mayor Ma Chaojun and his wife, US Chargé d'Affaires Smers, and the head of the US Military Advisory Group, General McClure, and his Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Brunco, all went to the airport to welcome them. Marshal Marshall wore a US Army general's uniform, and Mrs. Marshall wore a sky-blue dress and a sky-blue elegant small hat with a black veil. After disembarking, she gladly accepted the flowers presented by Secretary-General Jiang's wife and Mayor Ma's wife and expressed her gratitude. Marshal Marshall shook hands with Commander-in-Chief He, Minister Chen, and others one by one. After the band played the national anthems of the United States and China in succession, Marshal Marshall and his wife, accompanied by He and Chen, reviewed the honor guard and then drove into the city, going directly to the official residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road. Li Zhishan, the director of the Nanjing District of the Battlefield Service Corps, who was responsible for arranging the official residence, told reporters that Marshal Marshall and his wife were satisfied with the arrangement of the official residence. In addition, Marshall's aide-de-camp, Captain Wu Guoqing, said: Marshal Marshall will rest at the official residence tonight. It has not yet been decided whether he will receive reporters in the coming days. However, starting from the 30th, Marshal Marshall's headquarters will be moved here. Colonel Ke Yi, Marshal Marshall's personal chief of staff, also arrived in Nanjing on the same plane.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] According to sources close to Special Envoy Marshall, although the negotiations on ending the conflict in the Northeast have not yet yielded any concrete results, there is still room for optimism in resolving this issue. The government representative of the military three-person group, General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, and the CCP representative, General Zhou Enlai, will travel together from Chongqing to Nanjing this week. Once they arrive, the negotiations will resume. The loss of life, damage to property, and suffering of the people are increasing every day. We urge you to take immediate measures so that the groups that are ready and waiting for definitive instructions can begin work to restore peace to the people of the Northeast and restore unity to China. Signed by Detreille and others of the 27th group.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Flies to Xi'an; Received National Assembly Delegates Before Leaving Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Chairman Chiang and his wife left the anti-Japanese headquarters of the past eight years – the auxiliary capital – at 3:00 PM on the 30th on the Meiling aircraft. At 11:00 AM, the Chairman met with National Assembly delegates Wang Zhaorong, Wang Puhan, Shi Tiyuan, and Zeng Jikuan in Chongqing at the Zengjiayan official residence, explaining the process of the government's explicit order to postpone the National Assembly and the government's efforts to seek peace and unity and accommodate the opinions of all parties. He earnestly hoped that this intention would be conveyed to the National Assembly delegates in Chongqing. Minister of Civil Affairs of the National Government Wu Dingchang and Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee Shao Lizi accompanied the meeting. Hours before leaving Chongqing, the Chairman slowly toured the rooms of the official residence and rested for a moment on the balcony of the Linyuan, seemingly deeply attached to and reluctant to leave this second hometown. At 3:00 PM, the Chairman and his wife drove directly to the airport from Lingyuan, boarded the plane, and flew to Shaanxi. Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government Yu Jishi and more than 20 others accompanied him.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 30th] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived in Xi'an by special Meiling aircraft at 5:30 PM on the 30th. Yu Jishi and others accompanied them. Bai Chongxi, Hu Zongnan, Zhu Shaozhou, and others were all at the airport to greet them. Chairman Chiang will stay here briefly on his way back to the capital.</p>
<h3>Northeast Group's Work Stalled; US Team Leader Requests Swift Action</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] The Northeast Executive Group, which was ordered to depart without a solution to the Northeast problem, is currently frozen in the Northeast. The 27th and 28th groups have already departed for Kaiyuan, but like the 30th reserve group staying in Shenyang, they have nothing to do. The 27th Northeast Central Group, which is responsible for commanding the members, is even more distressed. Recently, Detreille and others, the US team leader of the group, sent a letter to General Bailud, the US Chief of Staff of the Executive Department, requesting instructions for their work and expressing their inner pain. The original letter is recorded below: Chief Bailud, We, the government, CCP, and US representatives of the 27th group in the nine northeastern provinces, believe that due to our responsibility to China, we must report to the responsible authorities that we urgently need to obtain a clear explanation and order, so that the groups in the nine northeastern provinces can begin constructive work. While this issue is unresolved, the war is underway in various parts of this area and is becoming increasingly fierce. There has already been much bloodshed among the Chinese people, and unnecessary destruction of houses and equipment is continuing. Therefore, the people of Jiudong Province are suffering and may continue to suffer for many years to come. With each day of delay, the loss of life, damage to property, and suffering of the people will increase. We urge you to take immediate measures so that the groups that are ready and waiting for definitive instructions can begin work to restore peace to the people of the Northeast and restore unity to China. Signed by Detreille and others of the 27th group.</p>
<h3>Tension in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 30th] Communist troops occasionally attack the outskirts of Beiping, but the national army in the city is strong enough to deter the Communist troops beyond seventeen miles. Another rumor said that the Communist troops attacked Nanyuan Airport on April 21st. Another several hundred Communist troops attacked a town east of the city and were repelled by the local garrison.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 30th] The situation here has suddenly become tense today. The police, military police, and officers and soldiers of the 94th Army jointly searched all ten prisons in Tianjin yesterday. About 3,000 people participated in this search. There are rumors here that the Communists will step up their activities in Tianjin, and there are even rumors that the Communists may carry out an uprising. Officers and soldiers of the 94th Army have placed sandbags and other obstacles in some parts of the city.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Regular Meeting to Be Held in Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>Discussing issues such as prices</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The first regular meeting of the Executive Yuan to be held in Nanjing was changed to 10:00 AM on the 1st because Premier Song had not returned. It is reported that this meeting will have a detailed discussion on current issues such as transportation, food policy, and prices. It is also learned that Premier Song is scheduled to return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 1st to preside over the meeting.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Return to Baoshan to Sweep Tombs in the Coming Days</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Zhang Jia'ao, Chairman of the Economic Commission of the Northeast Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai on China Airlines Flight 47 from Chongqing at 4:30 PM yesterday. More than 30 of his friends and family members came to welcome him at Longhua Airport. Zhang rested briefly in Shanghai and then returned to his hometown of Baoshan to sweep tombs. Zhang said, "I am here entirely for private matters. I have been away from Shanghai for eight years, and I am very happy to be back in my homeland." Zhang did not say a word about the Northeast issue. When asked "When will you go to the Northeast again?", he replied, "In a few days." At the airport, Zhang also patted his younger brother on the shoulder and said happily, "I haven't seen you in eight years, you've grown so tall." His pleasant mood was fully revealed in his words.</p>
<h3>Enemy Crimes in Hankou</h3>
<p>Fifty-Five Cases of Murder and Slaughter</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] It has been officially confirmed that Jingjiang County was captured by Communist troops on the 28th. Traffic between Jiangyin and Jingjiang is now cut off. Communist troops have blocked the traffic between Nantong and Rugao, and the waterways between Dongtai and Taixian. Yesterday, Communist troops were also discovered 14 li near the county seat of Haimen. The Communist troops disturbing southern Shandong are continuously advancing towards the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong.</p>
<h3>Price Hike on North China Railways; Councilors of the Beijing-Linqing Region Request to Stop It</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] Amidst the fluctuations in prices in North China, public utilities have resumed price increases. Starting tomorrow, the price of each kilometer on the North China railways will increase from two yuan to twelve yuan (however, food transportation will not be subject to a price increase). For example, the new price of a third-class passenger ticket on the Beiping-Tianjin section will be 1,681 yuan. Electricity fees will also double starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] After learning about the increase in train fares, the councilors of the Beijing-Linqing Council generally believed that the price increase of state-owned enterprises would only cause prices to rise further and affect people's livelihood. They have urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to stop it.</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie to Go to Nanjing Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Dong Yanping and Others Arrive in Bolia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Dong Yanping, head of our military delegation, and others arrived in Bolia. This place reported to the delegation at 9:00 AM on the 29th. In addition, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province, Guan Jiyu, Chairman of Songjiang Province, Yang Chuoan, Mayor of Harbin, etc., have now arrived in Vladivostok.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 29th] According to the "Xin Sheng Bao" news: A group of four representatives has arrived in Shenyang from Changchun, requesting the government authorities to expel the Communist troops from Changchun. These four people are the Chairman of the Changchun Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the President of the Changchun Buddhist Association, and the Vice President of the Changchun Taoist Association.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 30th] According to people from Andong: The Communist troops in the Andong area have established the "Andong Provincial Government," which governs the counties of Zhuanghe, Fengcheng, and Kuandian. They are vigorously recruiting puppet Manchukuo police and organizing local vagrants into security teams, and have established the Northeast Bank to issue banknotes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 29th] News reports from Pan Yang state: The Communist Party recently revealed that 26 government military and political officials have been captured in Changchun, including Chen Jiazhen, the major general of the Changchun Garrison Command.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 30th] The five American journalists trapped in Changchun heard that the US military authorities here will send a special plane to pick them up within a few days.</p>
<h3>Quanyuan County Holds a County-Wide Strike, Appealing to Be Placed Under the Jurisdiction of Anhui Province</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Quanyuan, 27th] On April 27th, the people of Quanyuan County unanimously appealed to have the county re-designated under the jurisdiction of Anhui Province (currently under Jiangxi Province), holding a county-wide strike, class boycott, and work stoppage, and held a grand parade. The situation is very tense.</p>
<h3>National Army Enters the Urban Area of Sipingjie; Fierce Fighting South of Gongzhuling; Soviet Troops Have Not Withdrawn from the Border Cities of the Northeast</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] The tug-of-war in New Sipingjie is still ongoing. Official sources received information last night that the National Army had occupied the urban area of New Sipingjie on the 29th, and the vanguard troops had reached south of Gongzhuling and were engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist troops. Official sources explained that the slow progress of the National Army going north was due to the continuous reinforcements from the Communist troops in northern Manchuria going south. At the most tense moment of the war, a brigade was moving south almost every day. Today, a reporter saw a map of the Northeast war at a certain place. At present, the armies of both sides in the Northeast are intertwined, almost in a mixed war state. One route of the National Army going north is following the Changchun Railway north, and the other route is going north from the Changchun Railway side. The two routes meet south of Gongzhuling, but these two blue lines pointing north still intersect with some red lines of unsuppressed Communist troops, such as the Communist troops still in Luopingjie and Lishu.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] It is rumored that the National Army has entered the entire urban area of Sipingjie this morning.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] Xinhua News Agency said: (1) The Northeast Democratic Allied Army has entered Harbin on the 28th after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. (2) The Communist and National armies had a fierce battle in the eastern suburbs of Sipingjie on the 26th. (3) After occupying Changchun, the Communist Party strictly guarded the central part and replaced the mayor of the city with Liu.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] Generals Zheng Dongguo and Liang Huasheng returned here from the fierce fighting on the front line of Sipingjie. They said they were confident that the recovery of Changchun was only a matter of time. They also said that the six divisions of the National Army determined to reach Changchun have placed the Communist troops in the Sipingjie area under intense artillery fire.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 30th] Today is the last day scheduled for the Soviet army to complete its withdrawal from the Northeast. According to fragmented reports obtained by the Beiping government: The Soviet army has withdrawn from the main cities and railway lines in the interior of the Northeast, but has not withdrawn from the border cities of the Northeast, including the free port of Dalian. Since the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9th last year, the Soviet army has occupied the Northeast for 264 days. Although the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship signed on August 14th last year clearly stipulated that the Soviet Union should transfer Chinese territorial sovereignty to the Chinese government, at the time of the Soviet army's withdrawal, the area controlled by the central government accounted for only 5% to 8% of the entire Northeast region.</p>
<h3>Visiting Mogan in the Misty Rain</h3>
<p>— Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Legend has it that during the Spring and Autumn period, Helü, the father of King Fuchai of Wu, ordered Gan Jiang to cast a sword on a mountain in the southwest. When casting the sword, the molten iron would not flow. His wife asked, "The molten iron won't flow, is there a clever plan?" Gan Jiang said, "The great master Ouyezi couldn't melt his sword either, only by marrying a woman to the furnace god can it melt." Moye, upon hearing this, jumped into the furnace, and the molten iron flowed out, and two swords were forged, the male named "Gan Jiang," and the female named "Moye." Later generations, to commemorate the hardship of Gan Jiang and Moye in casting the sword, named the mountain Mogan Mountain. Since then, some families have lived on the mountain. During the Qing Dynasty, there were many temples. After the Taiping Rebellion, Mogan Mountain was also devastated by war and became desolate. Forty years ago, the American Meiteng Gen came here to hunt in the mountains and found the scenery beautiful. He wanted to gather local people to develop this mountain. Coincidentally, many workers from Anhui passed by. After he called for help, everyone worked hard to develop it. Later, it slowly became a famous scenic area. Mr. Huang Yingbai here did indeed put in a lot of effort. By around the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the name of Mogan Mountain had spread far and wide, becoming an internationally renowned summer resort.</p>
<p>During the eight years of arduous resistance against the Japanese, Mogan Mountain also spent its days in the flames of war. After the victory, the revival of Mogan Mountain became a political and economic issue in Zhejiang. However, news of unrest on the road to Mogan Mountain was frequently heard. In order to truly understand its current situation, I decided to travel to Mogan Mountain.</p>
<p>That day, it was raining, and the ground was very muddy. We set off in a 1940 "Pierce" sedan. Passing through Gongchen Bridge, we slid onto the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. This road was exceptionally smooth before the war, but now it has simply become a rugged mountain road. Our car was constantly bouncing, the sound of stones hitting the steel plate under the car, and the splashing mud, like the sound of a boat sailing in the waves, really made people doubt whether we could reach Mogan Mountain? Each wooden bridge was made of four or five wooden planks nailed together. One of them had half of its bottom plate collapsed, with a few wooden planks suspended in the air. To pass over it, you would really sweat for the driver.</p>
<p>Passing Xiahe Liangzhu, we arrived at Pingyao, where there were only some merchants buying and selling wood. Then, passing Penggong and Dongzha, which used to be lush with forests and bamboo, making passersby feel like they were in a painting, it is now a desolate scene. The poplar and willow trees planted when the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway was built were more than ten feet tall, but unfortunately, only a few remain on both sides. The rest, I heard, were cut down by the enemy and puppets. Passing Shangbai, that was a "problematic" place. On the mountains in the distance, you could see the blockhouse buildings left over from the war. Arriving in Wukang, it no longer looked like a county town. Almost all the houses were destroyed by artillery fire, with broken walls and ruins everywhere, leaving a desolate impression. Some small markets were makeshift houses. The county government was temporarily set up in civilian houses. The entire county had only more than 50,000 people. The devastation after the war, like Wukang, would really take some time and effort to restore to its former appearance.</p>
<p>The car crossed Sanqiaobu and arrived at Shou Village, which is at the foot of Mogan Mountain. Some old people pointed out to me where the parking lot, the horse stable, the sedan chair stop, and the tourist registration office used to be. Now, only some dilapidated houses remain. It is said that the enemy had been here several times and fought with the guerrillas. Later, the New Fourth Army came again, and many houses were destroyed by artillery fire or demolished. There used to be five or six thousand people at the foot of the mountain, but now there are only five or six hundred. Because the people of Anhui put in a lot of effort in the development of Mogan Mountain, there are many people from Anhui. Among the current five or six hundred people, two-thirds are from Anhui. They cut some firewood every day and carry some things for people to make a living.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, there is a very well-built primary school, named Mogan Primary School. The school's facilities are also good, with more than 300 children. Most of their parents are farmers near the mountain. It is said that during the war, they never stopped classes. When the enemy came, they hid in the mountains and continued to have classes. When the enemy left, they moved back, until the New Fourth Army came before the victory. When the enemy came, the guerrillas also came, and only then did the singing and music stop in the chaos.</p>
<p>We walked up the mountain, first taking the new road. This road was built in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), like a small road. Cement water pipes and iron water pipes can be seen on the road, but they are already silted up and dilapidated.</p>
<p>This is truly a well-deserved scenic spot, with layers of peaks and lush trees. Occasionally, there are wisteria petals falling by the roadside, and roses and wild roses hiding in the weeds. The pomegranates are also showing off their beauty, but they are just growing. It is said that the roadside used to be planted with famous flowers, but now they are incomplete.</p>
<p>Although it is still raining, and the view is hazy with mist, the scenery before us is enough to make us linger.</p>
<p>Passing Tianchi Temple, there is a distinction between the new and old Tianchi. The new Tianchi is next to the temple, a small pond. It is said that colorful small fish can be caught here endlessly. The old Tianchi is in another place, with a monument erected by Zhou Qingyun to record it. Zhou once washed his eyes in Taoguang in Hangzhou and took golden lotuses to plant there. Now there are still a few lotus leaves.</p>
<p>Climbing further up, looking down, you can see green trees like clouds, rising and falling. On the mountainside, someone carved the words "Brushing Clouds." Then, to the Sword Pond, where Gan Jiang and Moye forged their swords. There is a sword-sharpening stone and a pool of water, making people think of the situation of the ancients. Then, to Luhua Marsh, where the water is extremely clear. It is said that drinking it can prolong life. The mountain people say that foreigners come here and take the water back to cook rice.</p>
<p>Another place is Stone Temple. Between two stones, there is a jade-like stalactite. Next to it is a temple called Shi Yi Temple. Then, to the Lotus Society, a place for prominent figures to practice piety. The building is of a new type. Wealthy people and prominent figures who come to the mountains in the summer must come here to practice piety. Zhang Jingjiang, Dai Chuanxian, and others all have records of it.</p>
<p>Far and near along the roadside, there are rows of newly equipped, ingeniously designed Western-style buildings, imagining the prosperity of the peak summer season. We visited the Mogan Mountain Administration. According to the person in charge, to revive Mogan Mountain, the first thing to do is to repair the roads, and the second is to strengthen security. There are more than 300 families on this mountain, with the houses numbered up to 623. There used to be many construction factories, many coppersmiths, and post offices, telegraph offices, and a large-scale Railway Hotel on the mountain. There was a ball field and a swimming pool, but now everything is abandoned. At the moment, there are already six or seven families who have started repairing their houses on the mountain. I hope that everyone can come back one after another to revive Mogan Mountain. The northwest of the mountain is Xiaofeng Anji, and the northeast is Wuxing, which can be said to be the key to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>We returned along the old road. The old road is also paved with cement stone steps, which shows the attention to detail in the management of this mountain at that time. Along the way, the trees are lush, and the bamboo forests are everywhere, making people reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Returning, we still stepped on this bumpy road that was as uneven as sailing in the waves. I thought that Mogan Mountain is a beautiful summer resort, but to revive Mogan Mountain, it is necessary to repair the roads and strengthen security forces.</p>
<p>I heard that Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has decided to repair the roads and strengthen security forces to revive this summer resort. (Posted on the night of April 28)</p>

<h3>Hoover Arrives in Shanghai from the Philippines to Investigate Famine Disasters in China, Seeking Effective Relief Measures for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Former US President Herbert Hoover, eagerly awaited by tens of millions of disaster victims in China, has been commissioned by President Truman to tour various countries in Europe and Asia to investigate the post-war famine situation. He arrived in Shanghai at 2:15 PM yesterday amidst enthusiastic welcomes, landing at Jiangwan Airport. Mr. Hoover has been regarded as a "friend of China." This is his third visit to China. Those who went to the airport to welcome him yesterday included Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, Food Minister Xu Kan, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Zhou Yichun, Mayor's representative Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Shihua, Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director-General Jiang Tingfu, US Consul General to Shanghai Davis, US Army Commander in China Lieutenant General Gilan, and several senior officials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Although Mr. Hoover is 72 years old, he is in good spirits. After disembarking, he shook hands with US Consul General Davis with a smile, then exchanged greetings with other welcomers and traveled by car to Hua Mao Apartments for rest, escorted by US military police motorcycles. Accompanying Mr. Hoover from Manila to Shanghai were seven aides including Mason, Corangam, Duke, Gilbert, Karpin, and Mayor. Mr. Hoover's visit to China aims to conduct an in-depth investigation and review of China's overall food problem and famine situation, in order to prepare a planned relief program. Mr. Hoover's aides told reporters that Mr. Hoover's stay in China will be short and his official duties will be heavy. He will decline various social engagements in Shanghai in order to concentrate his limited time on seeking effective relief measures for Chinese disaster victims.</p>
<p>Hoover photographed at the airport upon arrival in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Held a discussion at the residence</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Hoover met with responsible persons of various relief organizations at his residence, and held discussions with President Song, Director-General Jiang, and Ministers Xu and Zhou. Agriculture and Forestry Minister Zhou and Food Minister Xu, and officials from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reported on the Chinese food situation on the spot. Those who participated in yesterday's food meeting included US Agricultural Counselor Dawson, US Commercial Counselor Corda, United Nations Food Committee Colonel Harrison (Colonel Harrison recently arrived here from Tokyo to inspect the disaster situation in China), and MacArthur Headquarters Nutritional Service Consultant Hallie. Mr. Hoover plans to stay in Shanghai for two days, and will go to Nanjing the morning after tomorrow, returning to Shanghai in the afternoon. He may convene reporters from various newspapers in the city to make a statement. Mr. Hoover plans to return to the United States by plane from Shanghai on Saturday.</p>
<p>Reporters received by bandits</p>
<p>[Reuters, Manila, 30th] Hoover entertained reporters here yesterday, saying that the entire problem of the world today is the problem of supply. Our plan emphasizes prevention over treatment. The food situation in India is the most serious in the world.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Special Envoy Hoover</p>
<p>In 1897, Hoover was hired to Australia to investigate mining, and he engaged in mining there. In 1899, he returned to California and married Laura Henry, a classmate from Stanford University. During the Boxer Rebellion in China, Hoover was hired by the Tangshan Mining Bureau in China as the chief engineer, and he and his newlywed wife sailed from California to Tianjin. Shortly after Mr. and Mrs. Hoover arrived in Tianjin, the city was besieged by the Boxers. Mr. Hoover assisted in food supply and handled refugees. At that time, the British, German, and Belgian creditors of a certain coal mine, railway, and shipping company in coastal China hired Hoover to clear the accounts. After the matter was completed, he returned to California. In 1901, Mr. Hoover came to China again, serving as the chief engineer of the above-mentioned company, reforming the internal organization and employing more than 25,000 people, asking to build the Qinhuangdao seaport.</p>
<h3>Street Fight in Wuchang: Rickshaw Pullers and Horse Carriages Compete for Street Rights</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hankou, 30th] Rickshaw pullers in Wuchang City had a major dispute with horse carriages over street rights. A collective armed fight occurred yesterday afternoon, injuring more than 20 people. Rickshaw pullers went on strike.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang and Youth League Host National Congress Representatives Arriving in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Central Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Organization Minister Chen Lifu, and Youth League Secretary-General Chen Cheng represented the Kuomintang and the Youth League and hosted a tea party at 3:00 PM on the 30th to entertain the National Congress representatives who arrived in Nanjing. Wu was absent due to going to Shanghai, and Chen Lifu and Chen Cheng presided over the meeting, attended by more than 300 people. Chen Lifu, in his speech, first expressed his welcome, and then explained that the association requested a postponement because various parties had not yet submitted their lists, and Chairman Chiang finally made this decision. Your disappointment and Chairman Chiang's pain are the same. He hoped that the representatives would exchange opinions before the meeting so that they could be conveyed to the government. Chen Cheng used the saying "good things take time" to explain the postponement of the conference, hoping that the representatives would still actively work together to promote national construction. Subsequently, the representatives spoke, and they all believed that the National Congress had been in preparation for ten years. Now that it has been convened, it is now postponed again. The government should not postpone it due to the problems of a few parties, which would affect the government's prestige and the work of formulating the fundamental law of the country. They intend to unanimously request that the meeting be held at a fixed date. Give military representatives transportation convenience to come to Nanjing. The Constitution is a function of the National Congress itself and should not be subject to any interference. When the Shandong representative spoke, he described the various atrocities of the Communist army in Shandong, and eagerly hoped that the government would quickly rescue the people from the depths of water and fire. Fu Da replied that he should respond to various requirements and submit them to the government.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The National Congress representatives will hold a preparation meeting at 10:00 AM on May 2.</p>
<h3>Suzhou High Court President Sun Honglin Discusses the Exemplary Punishment of Traitors Chen and Miao: Chen Biqun and Chu Minyi Have Not Yet Requested a Retrial</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Suzhou, 30th] After the verdicts of traitor Chen Biqun and traitor Chu Minyi were announced, today is the eighth day. People from all walks of life believe that when traitor Chen was interrogated in court, he said that revolutionaries only have two paths when judged by national law: death or innocence. The court sentenced me to death, and I am willing to accept it. If I am sentenced to imprisonment, I will not accept it. Therefore, there are various rumors about whether they have applied for a retrial, and there is no consensus. The reporter specially visited President Sun Honglin of the High Court at around 4:00 PM on the 30th and received the following statement: The High Court has not yet received the retrial application forms of Chen and Chu. However, according to regulations, there are still three days before it is considered abandoned. Regarding the application for a retrial by traitor Chen Gongbo and traitor Miao Bin, the Supreme Court's reply has not yet been received. According to the express provisions of the Special Criminal Procedure Law, the Supreme Court usually completes the review procedures within 20 days after receiving the detailed document from this court, but there are also delays due to other reasons, and it is not convenient to make a judgment. However, in my opinion, traitors such as Chen are the main culprits of treason. Even if they contacted the central special agencies to protect patriots, their declaration of war against Britain and the United States indicates their hope that the United Nations would be destroyed. If our central government no longer exists, how is this different from directly undermining the foundation of the country? Therefore, their merits and demerits are vastly different and cannot be offset. Although it is said that the law is not beyond human sentiment, it is important to be impartial and not to take a light approach. If we do not impose severe penalties, then how can we determine the severity of punishment for those below? Public opinion is the mouthpiece of the people, and we should advocate that the public understand the legal point of view and not speculate.</p>
<h3>Capital High Court Announces Public Trial of Traitor Mei the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, officially announced this morning that the public trial of traitor Mei Siping will be held at 9:00 AM on May 3 in the court's First Tribunal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 30th] Wang Yitang and other nine important Chinese traitors in North China will be escorted to Nanjing by plane for trial. The second batch of traitors is scheduled to be transferred from the Army Prison to the court detention center tomorrow. A total of 392 puppet officials have been captured in Hebei Province, and 198 in Shandong Province, including two former puppet provincial chairmen, four puppet bureau chiefs, 26 puppet county magistrates, and nine generals who surrendered to the enemy.</p>
<h3>Implementation Measures for Demobilization of Female Volunteer Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Ministry of Education has formulated implementation measures for the demobilization of female volunteer soldiers: (1) Students and staff will be reinstated in their original schools and original service units by the Military Affairs Commission, with opportunities for promotion and upgrading, or they will be given a subsidy to return to their hometowns, or they will be introduced to various agencies for priority employment, allowing them to choose freely. (2) They will be issued three months of their original salary and travel expenses according to the rank of junior lieutenant; officers will be issued eight months of their original salary and travel expenses. (3) They will have priority in taking transportation. (4) Demobilization matters should be completed by the end of this year in various garrisons. (5) The government will grant female youths and their families all military preferential rights, which will be terminated from the date of demobilization.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Headquarters Established Yesterday, Zhang Qun to Take Office Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The Chongqing Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission was ordered to be established on April 30 at the old site of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission. Zhang Qun, who also serves as the director, is scheduled to take the oath of office at 3:00 PM on May 2 in the headquarters auditorium.</p>
<h3>Governor of Hong Kong Takes Office Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 30th] The Governor of Hong Kong, Young, arrived in Hong Kong Island today by plane from England via India. Government officials and civilians went to the airport to welcome him enthusiastically. The Governor is scheduled to hold an inauguration ceremony in the Hong Kong government tomorrow, marking the end of military government.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices in Hangzhou Soar, Exceeding 40,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hangzhou, 30th] It has been raining in Hangzhou for several days, which is beneficial to agricultural crops, but grain prices have risen particularly sharply. White rice has already exceeded the 40,000 mark. Rice merchants are still saying they have no goods. The Grain Association said that the prices in the Xia Shi and Wuxi production areas are higher than those in Hangzhou, and that the reserves can only last for ten days, and requested the Hangzhou Municipal Food Regulation Committee to hold an emergency meeting to adjust grain prices, causing citizens to panic. This reporter recently visited an authoritative economist in Hangzhou, who said that the world is experiencing a food shortage this year, and China is no exception. The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has requested relief from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, but the results have not been satisfactory. Coupled with the unstable situation in Nantong, it is possible that these factors have caused grain prices to rise. Judging from the facts, the food situation in Hangzhou has not reached an extremely alarming level, so the sharp rise in grain prices is largely due to human factors.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The First Labor Day After Victory</h3>
<p>Today marks the first Labor Day after our eight-year victory in the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>Today marks the first Labor Day as we begin postwar construction!</p>
<p>As we celebrate Labor Day this year, which marks the beginning of nation-building after the victory of the War of Resistance, we are filled with boundless enthusiasm and unprecedented joy. We extend our sincere and candid best wishes to the working class nationwide.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past eight years, working compatriots across the country, along with soldiers fighting on the front lines, cultivated this magnificent and vibrant flower of victory with boundless "blood" and immeasurable "sweat"! The entire nation, both soldiers and civilians, endured countless hardships and pains through heroic sacrifice and tireless labor, striving to achieve a glorious victory!</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, we witnessed:</p>
<p>(1) Our industrial working compatriots, following the relocation of factories inland, left their homes and families, venturing into the mountains and valleys. Utilizing dilapidated machinery and rudimentary equipment, they diligently increased production under frequent enemy air raids, supplying the needs of the front lines and sustaining the livelihood of the rear. Regardless of the cold or heat, day or night, living on meager meals and wearing tattered clothes, they remained steadfast industrial fighters in the national War of Resistance. They had no disputes, they were never afraid of hardship, and they never engaged in strikes or work stoppages!</p>
<p>(2) Our mining working compatriots, for the sake of resource development, crossed mountains and ridges, using crude tools to venture into deep mines. Amidst freezing weather and miasmic conditions, they diligently developed resources, strengthening economic warfare, and proving themselves worthy as a vital force in the economic mobilization of the national War of Resistance. They had no resentment, they were not afraid of shrinking back, and they never engaged in strikes or work stoppages!</p>
<p>(3) Our transportation working compatriots, to meet military needs, devoted themselves to road construction, traversing long distances and braving the elements. They built highways in towering mountains and drove frequently breaking-down cars through treacherous valleys. Regardless of fierce winds and heavy rains, scorching heat and freezing cold, they strengthened frequent military transport, even living primitive lives of hunger, cold, and raw sustenance, forming the vital transportation artery for the national War of Resistance. They felt no indignation, they did not try to escape, and they never engaged in strikes or work stoppages!</p>
<p>Today, it has been nine months since the victory of the War of Resistance. The contributions of our working compatriots across the country to the nation and the country are truly immense! To be honest, our War of Resistance did not rely on abundant material resources or substantial financial strength, but solely on the human power of our many who shed blood and sweat! Therefore, the merits of working compatriots across the country are comparable to those of soldiers who fought and bled. Today, it is exceedingly meaningful for friends in the labor movement to enthusiastically celebrate Labor Day!</p>
<p>In today's world, humanity is advancing towards the great road of peace, democracy, prosperity, and happiness. Today's China, the entire nation is striving to build a new country of freedom, independence, prosperity, and well-being. Working compatriots across the country, today, all recognize your important responsibilities and will all exert their full efforts to promote the glorious history of the War of Resistance and continue to work towards building a modern, industrialized new China. National prosperity and the well-being of the people are the goals of our Three Principles of the People, which are also the fruits that the working class across the country will reap through hard work.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, we cannot help but frankly review. We wish to express, with an open mind and sincere expectations, a brief overview of the dark clouds hanging over the current Chinese industry.</p>
<p>At the beginning of recovery and the start of nation-building, Shanghai, which had been occupied for eight years, returned to the embrace of the motherland, becoming the economic heart of the country once again. In recent months, due to soaring prices, the people's livelihoods have become difficult, and working compatriots in Shanghai naturally feel the same deep pain. We dare to assert that today's pain is by no means limited to the labor movement. Except for national scum, national thieves, and social criminals who are making "national disaster fortunes" and "victory fortunes" and still indulging in extravagance and pleasure, everyone is in pain. We dare to say further that today, there are still people whose pain is deeper and greater than that of working compatriots! If Shanghai wages can be adjusted according to the price index, then compared to the treatment of general military, civil, and educational personnel, it is still barely satisfactory. Many working compatriots in Shanghai are discerning, and there is no need to elaborate. Moreover, such pain is inevitable after a major war. Looking at the world from afar, which country's citizens are not in pain except for the uniquely endowed United States? China is poor and in the aftermath of war, how can it be an exception? Since victory, labor unrest in Shanghai has surged, and disputes have been incessant, all stemming from one word: "poverty". Prices are rising daily, and life is becoming increasingly difficult. We have infinite sympathy for the urgent demands of working compatriots across the country. However, when we think of the future of Chinese industry, we cannot help but say a few words of warning and encouragement amidst the celebrations:</p>
<p>Today's situation is indeed a great opportunity! We believe that:</p>
<p>First, Japan has been defeated, and Chinese industry should be able to rise. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japanese industry flourished, plundering China's cheap raw materials and using its own low-cost labor to develop light industry, especially the products of the textile and chemical industries, dumping them on the Chinese market. Before September 18, Japan's trade with China even ranked first, surpassing Great Britain, while the United States lagged far behind. After September 18, Japan further oppressed the development of Chinese industry with its "industrial Japan, agricultural China" policy, the so-called "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation," this set of economic aggression. Now that Japan has been defeated, our Chinese industry has eliminated a formidable enemy, and the future development of Chinese industry is infinitely bright.</p>
<p>Second, unequal treaties have been abolished, and after a century of constraint, there is a one-time liberation, and Chinese industry should be able to become autonomous. In the past, China's economy was too heavily constrained by unequal treaties. Foreigners in China, based on special privileges, used China's low-cost labor and further utilized Chinese raw materials. As long as they brought capital equipment (machines, etc.) and technology, they could freely establish factories in China for manufacturing, and the taxes on foreign goods imported from overseas were even lighter than those on domestic products, so that remote areas all became markets for foreign goods. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, our Chinese industry should be able to reduce external pressure.</p>
<p>Third, with the active assistance of the United States, Chinese industry can develop rapidly. The reason why Chinese industry is backward is that it lacks economic construction plans, scientific technology, and large amounts of capital (domestic and foreign capital). In the future, for Chinese industry, the government already has a whole economic construction plan, actively utilizes foreign capital, and has the full assistance of the United States in technology and equipment. The future development is immeasurable.</p>
<p>In short, the internal and external obstacles and difficulties of Chinese industry can all be overcome today. Only the development of Chinese industry is a bright and brilliant road for the Chinese labor movement. However, to expect the development of Chinese industry today, it greatly depends on the awareness and efforts of both labor and capital.</p>
<p>First, we wish that labor-capital disputes will no longer occur, and strikes and work stoppages will no longer be seen. Although industry is currently fraught with difficulties and lurking crises, in essence, as long as currency is tightened, the monetary system is adjusted, transportation is restored, and production is increased, prices will naturally tend to stabilize. Stabilizing prices is not an overnight achievement, but the government and the people should indeed work together to achieve it. In today's situation where prices have not yet stabilized, although there is temporary pain and it is impossible to actively and rapidly restore the pre-war standard of living, as long as everyone strives to increase production, the government can resolve wages and living standards in a reasonable manner. Strikes and work stoppages will only reduce production. How can a country become wealthy with sharp declines in production? In Shanghai, wages in various industries have recently been largely readjusted, with increases and decreases based on the cost-of-living index. If capital has made concessions by increasing wages and reducing working hours, then the labor movement must pay close attention to factory discipline and work efficiency. If the increase in work efficiency can be directly proportional to the increase in wages, then the increase in wages along with the price index is not a major concern for industry, or may even stimulate improvements in industrial management methods. Therefore, today's issue is not as much about wage disputes as it is about the importance of work discipline. We absolutely do not want to see the Chinese labor movement, which has always been known for its diligence, acquire the habit of resorting to strikes and work stoppages, causing Chinese industry to be in a predicament again, with many factories closing down and workers suffering unemployment!</p>
<p>Second, we wish that labor treatment will be improved through industrial development. Sun Yat-sen said: "Chinese workers must increase their status, and there are two conditions: First, the independence of the entire nation, and second, the development of domestic industry. If the entire nation is still under the oppression of imperialism, it is impossible for workers to demand separate liberation. Therefore, first, we must enhance the status of the nation; there is no workers' benefit without national interest. Second, we must seek the improvement of the lives of Chinese workers from the development of Chinese industry. The happiness of Chinese workers cannot be realized one day without the development of Chinese industry." Today, the Chinese nation has gained independence, and the first condition can be said to be met. Therefore, the improvement of labor life and treatment should be achieved through industrial development. The first article of the "Labor Policy Outline" passed by the Kuomintang's Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee last May 6 has already clearly stipulated the improvement of labor status and the improvement of labor life: "The goal of labor policy is to develop labor organizations, improve their status, improve their lives, and promote labor-capital cooperation, regulate labor supply and demand, increase labor efficiency, and strengthen international labor ties in accordance with the principles of national supremacy and the spirit of international cooperation, so as to ensure social security and meet the needs of national defense and people's livelihoods." Other proposals can also be said to be perfect for improving labor welfare. From now on, all that is needed is for the entire nation to work hard to implement it. The recent suggestion book provided by the U.S. State Department for the International Trade and Employment Conference to be held this summer has a passage on "Relieving Worries about Production and Employment Disruptions": "If a country can engage in regular and comprehensive production and foreign trade increases day by day, this is the greatest benefit that a nation can give to producers all over the world." On the road to nation-building, we do not have the ability to sell industrial products overseas, but at least we should have the effort to manufacture industrial products for our own consumption. We should not have the fear of "unemployment" at this time, but why is there unemployment? It can be seen that the damage suffered by Chinese industry is very serious. We wish that after the establishment of labor-capital appraisal committees in major cities across the country, all labor-capital disputes can be rationally agreed upon and legally mediated, so that Chinese industry can breathe a sigh of relief in a peaceful and stable environment, and then take the road of gradual development under the conditions of striving for excellence in technology management and all other aspects. Only in this way can Chinese industry have hope, and the Chinese labor movement will be happy.</p>

<h3>Byrnes Proposes Suggestion; Four Powers Conclude Treaty of Mutual Assistance; Guaranteeing German Disarmament for Twenty-Five Years; Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Agree to Discuss Furthermore</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatches] London, 30th - Broadcasted: The American side suggested that the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers should discuss the issue of the Four Powers concluding a twenty-five-year treaty of mutual assistance for the occupation of Germany. The Soviet side has already agreed to this. On the other hand, the American side will also express concessions to the opinions of the Soviet side.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] American Secretary of State Byrnes announced last night that he had proposed that the four countries of Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States should conclude a treaty of mutual assistance for a period of twenty-five years to guarantee the disarmament of Germany. If this proposal is passed by the U.S. Senate and approved by Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the United States will continue to participate in maintaining European security with military force for at least twenty-five years after the current state of military occupation of Germany ends. Byrnes said: Last Christmas, he discussed the Four Powers Treaty with Stalin in Moscow. Stalin agreed with this idea, and he himself had a strong belief, so he proposed a draft of the Four Powers Treaty. Byrnes made this suggestion at the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. At that time, the meeting had decided to include the entire German issue on the agenda and had begun to discuss the disposal of Italian colonies. It took five hours to complete the discussion. After the meeting, Byrnes met with journalists and elaborated on the long-term policy of the United States on Germany and European security. The draft treaty stipulates that the four countries will implement a supervisory system on Germany to confirm that the German army, general staff, stormtroopers, secret police, etc., have been "completely disarmed, demobilized, and disbanded, and that there is no military equipment manufacturing or import." Byrnes also said that a similar treaty has been drafted for Japan and submitted to the Pacific countries, but it has not yet been discussed with those countries, so he is unwilling to comment. However, the Four Powers Treaties regarding Germany and Japan are completely unrelated to the peace treaties with Germany and Japan. The United Nations Charter stipulates that it has the right to conclude agreements of this nature, and they can be extended for another twenty-five years after the expiration date. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault both supported Byrnes's suggestion to include this treaty on the agenda of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov disagreed, saying that the meeting should discuss the entire German issue, and that the Four Powers Treaty was premature. It might as well form a supervisory committee to determine the extent to which Germany has been disarmed. Bevin and Byrnes replied that the Allied Control Council for Germany was already carrying out this task. Byrnes then requested the meeting to be adjourned, and the issue of the Four Powers Treaty remained unresolved. At tonight's meeting, before raising the German issue, the following suggestions will be heard first:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately allow Libya to become independent and establish a new country in northeastern Africa, to be administered by Great Britain under trusteeship.</p>
<p>(2) The Soviet Union had previously requested to administer Tripolitania in North Africa under trusteeship and now proposes a compromise solution.</p>
<p>(3) The United Nations Security Council decides on the trusteeship of Italian colonies.</p>
<p>(4) The Dodecanese Islands are handed over to Greece.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently stated that Great Britain agrees in principle with the American suggestion that the Four Powers conclude a treaty to supervise German disarmament, but it is not fully supporting it at present. Great Britain would rather include this matter on the agenda for general discussion.</p>
<h3>Main Points of the Draft Treaty Proposed by Byrnes</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] The draft treaty proposed by Byrnes for concluding a mutual assistance treaty with various countries includes an introduction and five articles in the main text. The main points of the articles are as follows.</p>
<p>Article 1: The contracting states shall ensure the elimination of all German military groups, the prohibition of manufacturing and importing war materials, and the prohibition of using any factories or laboratories for military purposes, by means of disarming Germany, demobilizing the German army, and disbanding the German general staff.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Four Powers Control Commission for Germany shall carry out inspections within the stipulated period to supervise the correct implementation of the above clauses.</p>
<p>Article 2: The four contracting states shall each ensure the disarmament of Germany within their occupied zones, and the period of occupation of Germany shall be extended until Germany accepts Articles 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Article 4: The four contracting states shall communicate information at any time through the Control Commission so that action can be taken in the event of Germany violating the treaty. Six months after the signing of this treaty, the four signatory states shall declare what troops will remain to maintain the implementation of the various clauses.</p>
<p>Article 5: This treaty shall come into effect upon signature, and its effective period shall be twenty-five years.</p>
<h3>No Agreement Reached by Four Powers on the Disposal of Italian Colonies; Decision to Include the German Issue on the Agenda</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] At tonight's meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, which lasted for five hours, no agreement was reached on the disposal of Italian territories, but the entire German issue has been included on the agenda. Today's meeting first discussed the most serious issue on the agenda: the disposal of Italian colonies and the control of the eastern Mediterranean. The issue of the Trieste and the Italian-Yugoslav border is listed as the second item on the agenda and is scheduled to be discussed this Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] At last night's meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, the positions of Great Britain and the Soviet Union on the disposal of Italian colonies were very different from those at the London Conference in September last year. Byrnes reiterated the plan announced in London in September last year, advocating that Italian colonies should be placed under international trusteeship. Molotov then stated: The Soviet Union now proposes that Tripolitania and Cyrenaica should be governed by the United Nations, but Tripolitania should have one Soviet administrator and one Italian deputy administrator, assisted by a consultative body composed of one representative each from Great Britain, the United States, and France, and two representatives from local residents. After the foreign ministers spoke in succession, the meeting still had no resolution. Yesterday's meeting also discussed the Dodecanese Islands and the Austrian issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] It is heard that Bevin has brought from London the entire policy of the British Empire on Tripolitania and other Italian territories, the Dodecanese Islands, and the lifeline of the British Empire in the Mediterranean. Great Britain opposes the Soviet Union's request to administer Italian territories under trusteeship, and its attitude has become stronger after talking with Smuts.</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Remnants Still Trying to Revive</h3>

Hatoyama then went to visit Shidehara at 6:40 PM to explain the Liberal Party's cabinet formation plan based on the Socialist Party's attitude. Policy committee members from both the Liberal and Socialist parties have been appointed, and concrete agreements on various policies are expected to be reached soon. Although the decisions of the two parties' policy coordination committee must be approved by a four-party meeting, it is widely believed that once the two parties' policies are successfully coordinated, the four-party meeting will be no problem. It is expected that the order to form a cabinet will be issued within the next two to three days.</p>

<h3>General Manager of the New-New Company, Li Ze, Case to be Sentenced on the 7th; Defendant Says He Did Not Do Anything Against His Conscience; Lawyers Zhang Chen and Guo Offer Sharp Defenses</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The case of Li Ze, the general manager of the New-New Company, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, was heard for the fourth time yesterday afternoon in the High Court's Provisional Criminal Court. The public gallery was completely full, and the aisles were also packed. At 3:00 PM, Judge Liu Yugui, together with Judges Qiu Huan and Cao Jun, opened a joint trial and announced a renewed hearing. Li Ze was brought to the dock. Informants Shu Yueqiao, Han Wucheng, Yao Zhuoren, and Ye Qiubin were all present in court. After Judge Liu questioned them one by one, lawyers Chen Tingrui and Zhang Shijian defended Li Ze with sharp arguments. At 6:20 PM, Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and set the sentence for 2:00 PM on May 7th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday, when Li Ze arrived in court, he was wearing a gray-green gown, yellow leather shoes, and black-rimmed glasses. He walked in with his head held high. After listening to the clerk read the previous record, he said, "I have nothing to say." After the clerk finished reading the record of the previous court hearing of the informants, which was confirmed by Shu Yueqiao and others as accurate and signed in order, Li began his defense: (1) Regarding the false business consolidation association, he stated that the association was entirely initiated by the false Ministry of Industry, and all founders, preparatory committee members, and directors were entirely determined by the false government without seeking consent in advance. At that time, he was oppressed by the enemy and had no choice but to act as a director. The business consolidation association itself was also a "passive organization" that nominally governed all material control associations and had the power to oversee all materials, but the heads of the material control associations were directly appointed by the false Executive Yuan, so he could not be held responsible for the material control. As for the purchase of cloth, it was decided by the Japanese military and the false Executive Yuan. At that time, Chairman Tang Choumin strongly opposed it, but he was forced by the enemy's power and eventually failed. However, thanks to the efforts of the business consolidation association, the purchase method was changed, "reducing the suffering of merchants." The effects were: first, silk and hemp were not included in the purchase; second, cotton yarn was not purchased in disassembled packages; third, the goods used by factories for three months were not purchased; and fourth, the inventory needed by stores for one month was not purchased. Only more than sixty pieces of cotton yarn were taken away by the Japanese army in Tang Shouchang's hands. It is said that Lan Ting did not give the Japanese a single yarn or cloth after taking over. (2) Regarding the New-New Company hiring Japanese Ito as a consultant, Li Ze replied: The Japanese once wanted to buy the company for 10 million yuan but failed. Later, they wanted to change it to a Sino-Japanese joint venture but also failed. When the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese took the opportunity to cause trouble, and he had no choice but to hire a Japanese consultant to deal with it, in order to protect the company's assets and maintain the safety of his colleagues. (3) Regarding the dedication of scrap iron for use by the enemy army, Li Ze firmly stated that it was sold to Sen Dai, and there were receipts and account books as proof, and both witnesses and material evidence were available, so he would not say more.</p>
<p>However, Shu Yueqiao said: In 1936, when the boycott of Japanese goods was at its fiercest, Li Ze went to Japan to purchase goods and even evaded taxes at customs. His character is already unworthy, and what he said is all a strong defense. The evidence he presented is also false, and so on. Han Wucheng said: Li Ze's description of the business consolidation association's affairs is so detailed that it is clear that he must bear actual responsibility, so he requested the court to pronounce judgment as soon as possible. Li Ze heard this and said that he had done nothing against his conscience or against the country. He was willing to accept the most severe sanctions, so he also sincerely hoped to end the case as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Judge Liu then ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Rong Duo then stood up and announced two counts against Li Ze: (1) The nature of the false business consolidation association was to "have Chinese people come forward to handle affairs, which is more convenient than the Japanese," to replace the Japanese military's task of controlling the economy. Its main tasks were: first, the collection and distribution of materials in East China; second, the control of material movement; third, the control of material exchange and trade in Central China, South China, and North China; fourth, the management of factory materials; and fifth, the management of military supplies. These tasks were all beneficial to the enemy and harmful to the people, and Li Ze participated in them from preparation to the end, so his crime is clear. (2) During the war, the enemy army was in urgent need of steel, and Li Ze transported a large number of water ting by Japanese yellow military vehicles to aid the enemy. Therefore, he should be punished according to Article 2, Section 1, Clause 4, and Article 3, Section 2, Clause 5 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Judge Liu asked Li Ze, do you have anything else to say? He replied: "His words are all ideal. The judge should make a judgment based on the facts." Then Li Ze retreated to the side seat, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and looked around with his head held high.</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen Tingrui presented three pieces of evidence at the beginning of the hearing, namely public letters from the Military Statistics Bureau, the Loyal Salvation Army, and the Refugee Relief Association, proving that Li Ze was indeed meritorious to the country. His defense stated: "China now needs the rule of law the most. Without the rule of law, China cannot exist. The law is the spirit of China, so I want to defend Li Ze." He also said that the informants only had oral and unreliable testimony, while the defendant had witnesses and material evidence, so the alleged crime cannot be established and he should be found not guilty. Lawyer Zhang Shizhao then defended, using historical examples and legal principles to prove that the defendant should be acquitted. Finally, Li Ze added: "If Chairman Chiang recognizes me as a traitor, then I am a traitor, but otherwise, I will never admit it." At this point, Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for 2:30 PM on May 7th.</p>
<h3>Summary of Lawyer Zhang's Defense</h3>
<p>Lawyer Zhang's defense highlights:</p>
<p>The indictment focuses on two points: one, the defendant served as a director of the puppet merchant association; two, the company sold old Yongting assets to the enemy. Such cases can be discussed in terms of three aspects: (1) criminal intent, (2) circumstances, and (3) actions. The defendant happened to be a leader in the department store industry, and by virtue of his position, he was assigned as a director of the puppet merchant association. Although the nominal position differs in scope from that of ordinary citizens and ward chiefs, the constraints imposed upon him by the puppet regime were the same. The defendant was located in Shanghai, which was entirely under enemy control, and the circumstances were unique, so he cannot be equated with traitors in the Greater Rear Area. The defendant's involvement with the puppet merchant association was only nominal, with no practical involvement; he was present in the midst of it all, yet he harbored the heart of [unclear], and reported any underground work opportunities. He spared no effort to rescue and offer aid. To the best of his ability, he was willing to risk his life. When the Allied forces planned to land at the Shanghai Mausoleum, the defendant, along with others, directly supplied the landing forces with materials, amounting to a massive sum of 300 million, a matter for which the Statistics and Investigation Bureau and the Chairman's Representative Office commended and requested awards. He also raised 150 million yuan for the Pudong Loyal Salvation Army, which fully proves the defendant's patriotic intentions and his covert efforts to save the country. In summary, the defendant's criminal intent was nonexistent, the circumstances were indeed compelling, and his actions clearly revealed the opposite of aiding the enemy. The legal provisions set by the members of the Supreme National Defense Council clearly define these three aspects, each with its own reference, therefore, the defendant is innocent.</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Must Be Convened as Scheduled; A Swift Resolution to National Affairs Must Be Sought</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Based National Assembly Representatives Issue Joint Declaration</p>
<p>Elected representatives to the National Assembly from various regions have come to Shanghai, exchanged opinions, and issued a joint declaration that states: (1) Convening the National Assembly is a consistent proposition of the founding father, Sun Yat-sen. Parties with military power are using excuses to coerce and delay the National Assembly, seize political power, and divide the country. The government has compromised for the sake of peace, but after several months of delay, the situation has worsened. Therefore, the National Assembly must be convened as scheduled, based on the public opinion of the people, and seek a swift resolution to national affairs. (2) The government's convening of the National Assembly has been delayed to the point where there is no further room for delay, and finally, through negotiation, it was decided to be held on May 5th of this year. Now, due to the selfish intentions of a few parties, the laws have been changed. The representatives who accepted the people's trust must correct this immediately. (3) The Republic of China was founded 35 years ago, but the fundamental law to ensure the long-term stability of the country is still pending. Those who harbor wild ambitions can take advantage of the absence of a common law, create chaos, and distort the truth. Therefore, the National Assembly should be convened immediately to formulate a constitution, realize democracy, select the virtuous and capable according to constitutional norms, and be strictly supervised by the people to ensure a clear division of powers and responsibilities, so as to ensure the unity of the country and promote lasting peace. (4) The representatives share the fate of the nation and the people, so they must urge the government and all parties to be finally vigilant. The representatives' specific opinions, as mentioned above, are aimed at respecting public opinion and maintaining the integrity of the country. In order to fulfill their mission, they have decided to attend the meeting as scheduled, with no turning back, so as not to fail the trust of the people.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The seawall in Pudong, Shanghai, is severely damaged, posing a great danger. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau is extremely concerned about this. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, he specially invited Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He, Ma Shaohao, Director of the United Relief Shanghai District, Shi Konghuai, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, relevant authorities, and newspaper reporters to conduct an on-site inspection. They departed from the pier of the Bund Waterside Hotel on the municipal government yacht "Xidu" and sailed directly to Gaoqiao.</p>
<p>After arriving at Gaoqiao, they boarded three cars and headed straight to the former seaside bathing area. Along the way, Mayor Qian personally observed the situation with the locals, who were overjoyed and shouted slogans to welcome him. The police station also played music to welcome them. The seaside bathing area was desolate, and the scenery was completely changed. The seawall had been in disrepair for many years, causing it to lean and collapse, posing a danger to nearby houses. According to local residents, seawater often flooded the [unclear] during high tide, forcing them to evacuate temporarily. However, they could not allow the fertile land left by their ancestors to be sacrificed to the floods.</p>

<p>[Report from Nanjing by This Newspaper] Zhang Xiang, an inspector from the Ministry of Education, recently returned to Nanjing to report to the Ministry of Education on the educational inspection of Jiangsu, which lasted for more than a month. According to Inspector Zhang's inspection of primary and secondary school education in Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Kunshan, Nantong, and other places, as well as provincial secondary and primary schools in Shanghai, the reporter asked about his impressions of the inspection, and he replied as follows:</p>
<p>Provincial Schools Regarding provincial schools, the Shanghai Provincial High School's school buildings were newly built in Longhua before the war and are grand in scale, almost surpassing Nankai University. During the occupation, it was converted into an internment camp for British and American expatriates, so 70-80% of the buildings are intact. The factory equipment was preserved because the head of the engineering department was able to find a way to avoid enemy targets and relocate the equipment properly. Machinery ordered from Europe and the United States before the war arrived during the war and remains unopened to this day. Therefore, the school's equipment, if properly reorganized and restored, has considerable potential for development. As for the school buildings of secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools in Zhenjiang and Suzhou, many have been damaged, and their vitality will be difficult to restore for some time. Although there are 170 million yuan in educational reconstruction funds, the 50 units of the provincial education authorities are mostly allocated for repairs and are insufficient for reconstruction.</p>
<p>Local Education Because of this year's exemption from land tax, local education funds are scarce, resulting in teacher living allowances of only 24,000 yuan (Zhenjiang) or even 16,000 yuan (Kunshan), and base salaries are only calculated at 70 times, which is not enough to live on. Schools have no choice but to collect miscellaneous fees or subsidies, ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 yuan per student, to supplement the funds. This may not be in accordance with the law, but it is really a last resort. Fortunately, the parents of the students are able to understand this situation, and the teachers are able to endure hardship and persevere in their lives and adhere to their posts. There are bound to be problems with teacher qualifications. Except in Nantong, where there are many qualified normal school students due to the promotion of normal schools by Zhang Jian in the past, most primary schools in Tongyi still have qualified normal school graduates. Zhenjiang is closer to the capital, and those with sufficient ability to become teachers have mostly moved to neighboring counties for higher-paying jobs, affecting the quality of teachers, which is slightly lacking in uniformity. For the sake of future education, teachers' salaries should be raised and protected by law.</p>
<h3>Anhui Education Department Orders All Counties to Strengthen the Practice of Students at Simplified Normal Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from Hefei by This Newspaper] In order to strengthen the practice of students at the simplified normal schools in various counties in Anhui and enhance their teaching skills, the Anhui Education Department has issued an order to all counties with simplified normal schools to uniformly change the model central national schools into affiliated primary schools of the simplified normal schools to facilitate student practice. The salaries of teachers and staff will be paid according to county-level standards. Counties without simplified normal schools will be converted into township central national schools.</p>

<h3>French Educational Reform Plan</h3>
<p>— Translated by Hu Pinqing</p>
<p>The special feature of today's France is the profound and sincere desire for reform. Among all the matters that people discuss, one is the issue of education: "Our house is on fire, but there is a piece of furniture that needs to be rescued, and that is the intelligence of our children." We often like to say that French middle schools and universities are factories for manufacturing fools and parasites, but in fact, the graduates of French schools are no worse than others. This is because the French like to belittle themselves, are dissatisfied with reality, and hope to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Now people have a new concept in education. After two wars, the French deeply know that they must make the best use of everything and make the best use of everyone's talents.</p>
<p>Therefore, Professor Langevin and others presented an educational reform plan to the Constituent Assembly in February. The main purpose is to enable every young person to have the opportunity to develop his talents as much as possible and to promote compulsory education at all levels.</p>
<p>In the educational reform plan, one of the most important points is to eliminate the traditional degree system. This kind of degree is a symbol of the end of secondary education, because this system has many drawbacks. A young person often lives in fear in order to cope with the degree exam. They only bury themselves in their studies, so that they lose their thinking and curiosity. This secondary education system not only prevents the natural development of intelligence, but is also very unfair, because at the end of the study period, the exam is held in the school, and the examiner is a teacher who knows the students well.</p>
<p>The original system was that after graduating from middle school, students could directly enter the university without taking an exam. However, most people feel that the level of recent middle school graduates is not high enough, so Langevin advocates setting up a "three-level" system at the university. Students who transfer to the "third level" need to take an entrance exam. Some of the students in the "third level" are preparing to enter the Higher Normal School and various art schools, and others are entering ordinary universities. The university graduation exam is not held separately by each school, but is a unified exam held by all universities in the country.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the "fourth level", which is the real higher education. Only a few universities have fourth-level education, and the purpose is to cultivate scientific talents. Fourth-level education focuses on the natural development of intelligence, and there are no restrictions on exams and degrees.</p>
<p>These are the main points of the Langevin educational reform plan. Its main purpose is to develop students' thinking and intelligence, so that they are not restricted by textbooks and exams.</p>

<h3>Bank of China Supplies Without Restriction Gold Price Turns Flat After Rising Recovers 90,000 Yuan Lower Than Before Allotment Price Changed to 1.85 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, speculators made a desperate gamble, which caused President Bei of the Bank of China to be in a bitter battle. The allotment was 1180 bars, and the price was raised to 1.85 million. The speculative psychology initially achieved great success, thinking that the future was unlimited. Those who borrowed money to play the stock market saw that the situation was not good, and short squeezes arose, so that after 10 o'clock, the price was shouted to a high of 2 million, creating a new record. Under this crisis, the Bank of China had to use the last resort, declaring an allotment price of 1.85 million, and continuing to register and supply without restriction. The tide of rising wind began to change and fall back. Those who saw the opportunity to escape emerged, almost ending at a low price, and the fiery and enthusiastic situation gradually became calm. The morning opening was still raised to beyond the 1.9 million mark. After the opening, the price gradually fell back from 1.94 million, struggling between 1.83 million and 1.86 million around 10 o'clock. The allotment price of the Bank of China was announced, raised to 1.85 million, and the buyers were quite satisfied. The general sellers of gold to buy stocks were on the verge of desperation, fearing that the Bank of China would be defeated, and that a step-by-step rise would develop, and the long side would have the opportunity to take advantage of it, making every effort to force a short squeeze. So, shortly after the allotment, the price jumped to a new peak above 1.97 million. Some of those who were anxious to make up for it even traded at a price of 2 million. At this point, the pressure on the Bank of China increased again and again, hoping to turn the tide, and the recovery began. On the one hand, it was also reported that the Bank of China could continue to supply without restriction at the original price of 1.85 million on the same day. The high-spirited bulls began to feel tight and did not dare to do as they pleased. At the same time, the silver root, which was looser in the morning, gradually tightened after that, so that those who sold gold to buy stocks fell back to within 1.8 million at noon before slightly stabilizing. However, the recovery power was weaker, and it was difficult to exceed the allotment price after that. The long side continued to close positions, and continued to fall weakly to below 1.75 million in the afternoon. As a result, the closing price was 90,000 yuan lower than before, and the decoration gold was listed at 190,000 yuan. The sales of patterned silver in Jiangbei resumed vigorously, rising to 1,800 yuan. Silver dollars were around 1,100 yuan. The secret break of silver roots was erratic, and the interest rate ranged from 1.6 cents to 2 cents. In the afternoon, it was even more chaotic, and some even shouted as high as more than 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Continues to Decline Slightly Speculative Nature Clearly Revealed</h3>
<p>The trend of public debt followed in the footsteps of the Chinese stock market. Speculative funds withdrew and turned to gold, so that it wanted to rise but lacked stamina in the middle, and finally ended at a low price. Tong Bing opened at 6,100 yuan in the morning, and stepped up to 6,800 yuan after opening. Speculative funds shifted to gold, so that the long side sold off in unison. At noon, it fell to 5,600 yuan. As a result, the closing price continued to fall 550 yuan lower than before. Due to the time constraints, Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu only fell 250 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollars Follow the Gold Market As a Result, the Price Was Squeezed Down by 200</h3>
<p>The US dollar is not as sharp as gold. It is heard that the Bank of China has recently simplified the procedures and quickly approved those seeking to settle US exchange. Legitimate applications from importers are convenient for settlement, and unqualified goods have also calmed down slightly, so that the US dollar has completely shifted with the gold market. The exchange rate for gold has also been pulled up to 725 yuan per ten taels. The morning opening retreated from 2,700 yuan to 2,550. Buyers maintained support at the low, and the gold price indirectly boosted the price, and rose again to 2,750 yuan after 10 o'clock. When the gold market changed color, it broke into 2,500 yuan at noon. Although there was some slight struggle after entering, the gold price had fallen back again and again, and it finally ended at a low price. As a result, the closing price was 200 yuan lower than before. Hong Kong banknotes were stable but tired and fell back 15 yuan. Hong Kong Power Law fell slightly by 5 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still flat.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Progresses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American Cotton Telegraph reported a decline of 8 to 13 pounds, with the near-term at US$27.76, the far-term at 27.90, and the Mitterlin spot at 28.41. The local spot cotton trading has seen further progress. Private yarn mills such as Hongzhang and Shenxin's 16th Factory have made purchases, with a total of 1,200 to 1,300 bales traded. The market price of seed cotton is the most sought-after, rising by 3,500 yuan alone.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Dust Gradually Active</h3>
<p>Outer-port merchants are still actively searching for bituminous coal dust, and trading is gradually becoming active. In particular, Kailuan No. 2's Pudong wharf receipts are the most popular, with transaction prices between 160,000 yuan and 165,000 yuan, while the spot price in Shanghai is still only 170,000 yuan. Another 7,000 tons of Hongji medium-sized white coal continues to be shipped from Annam and is currently being unloaded and transported. In addition, the People's Livelihood Coal Management Office has now completed the handling of civilian coal for cooking, which was originally set at 5,000 tons. There are still more than 1,000 tons left. The remaining coal will be distributed to fellow coal industry service workers at a price even cheaper than the flat price, so the market price of white coal may fall again.</p>
<h3>Sharp Fluctuations in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market experienced a sharp rise and fall. Initially, continuing the upward momentum of the previous day, it rose in a straight line. 20-count yarn once reached a new high of 1.38 million, and 16-count Guangming yarn also jumped to 1.1 million. In an instant, dealers profited and began selling off their holdings. The former then fell back to 1.26-1.27 million, and the latter to 1.02-1.03 million. This drastic reversal was rare in recent days. All yarn types closed at the day's low, resulting in a final market situation similar to yesterday, with no major changes. Although transaction volumes were not large, the market was relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Significant Rise and Slight Correction in the Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, after several days of excessive price increases, saw sluggish sales, with some sellers pulling back. As a result, market momentum flattened. The guild's initial price quote in the morning was 69,000 yuan, which then dropped to 68,000 yuan, 67,000 yuan, and 66,000 yuan. Finally, it rebounded slightly to 67,500 yuan. The morning trend remained flat at 66,000 to 67,000 yuan. These were all guild warehouse receipts, which were 2,000 to 3,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Other spot goods also saw price easing.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods Market Rebound</h3>
<p>The Northern and Southern goods market had been weak for a long time. Recently, due to the rebound in other commodity prices, it also rose. For example, dried longan has risen by more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, Xinghua longan even exceeded the 100,000 yuan mark. Longkou vermicelli rose to 90,000 yuan, and high-quality hand-picked jujubes were priced at 45,000 yuan. The first batch of new spring sprouts was once priced as high as 200,000 yuan, but recently more supply has arrived, and the current price is 140,000 yuan. Fuling pickled mustard tubers are priced at 72,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Loans and Rice Awaiting Further Instructions; Rice Prices Stabilized at a High Level</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rice market resumed trading yesterday morning, with good order and firm prices. The price was approximately 42,000 yuan per dan, and trading was brisk. According to the market负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge), about 5,000 dan of rice were registered at the market yesterday. The rice purchased with the rice loan will not be traded on the market but will be directly supplied to rice stores to meet retail needs. However, the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office had not yet received the rice yesterday, so distribution may take some time. The Grain Administration Commissioner's Office issued Public Notice No. 11 in the rice market yesterday, stating that all rice purchased by grain merchants with loans must be reviewed and have sales methods determined by the Office in conjunction with the Municipal Provisional Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Social Affairs Bureau before being announced to the public.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market supply was acceptable, and warehouse inventory was average. There was little excitement at noon, and no significant gains or losses. It is necessary to observe future market changes. After a sharp drop in flour prices, warehouse inventory slightly recovered, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. However, miscellaneous brands of flour remained flat. The oil market remained soft, continuing to weaken by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran fell by another 200 to 300 yuan, and soybean cake gradually decreased by 300 to 400 yuan. The yellow bean customer market was suspended, and local merchants were picking up the higher prices. The market was rising rapidly and then dropping. High-quality goods held steady, while medium and low-quality goods fell by more than 2,000 yuan, with limited transactions. Raw peanuts were similarly priced, while red sorghum prices dropped by a little over 1,000 yuan with no buyers. Corn also decreased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The peak for all grains has passed, and the market is now in a state of fluctuation.</p>
<h3>American Goods Imported in Succession: Wheat...Fruit...Iron Wire</h3>
<p>The Pacific, belonging to the 天祥 (Tiānxiáng) Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai for the first time after the war, bringing over 9,000 boxes of oranges and other fruits, 450 tons of iron wire, and over 200 boxes of cigarette paper, totaling approximately 5,400 tons of miscellaneous goods. In addition, the company's 脱库拉 (Tuōkùlā)号, which loaded over 8,000 tons of wheat from the United States, arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday noon. If it could not be imported yesterday, it was scheduled to enter the Huangpu River this morning, with plans to dock at buoys 39 and 40 for unloading.</p>
<h3>New Cantonese Rice Quotation: 68,000 per Stone; Price Control Measures Ineffective</h3>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou, 29th] Although rain has been beneficial to crops, the rice market here has skyrocketed to a new high of 68,000 yuan per stone today. All price control measures have been ineffective, and the impact on people's livelihood will be severe.</p>
<h3>Stable Leather Market Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The leather industry is one of the four major light industries. Since the victory against Japan, domestic leather manufacturers have faced a lack of raw materials, high expenses, and heavy costs. Furthermore, European and American leather has been continuously imported, and its price is even lower, causing a significant blow to domestically produced leather. Many manufacturers have been selling at a loss, making it difficult to maintain operations. It is now known that a large quantity of European and American leather raw materials are about to arrive, which will reduce the cost of leather production and prevent further losses. Therefore, the recent leather market conditions have gradually stabilized.</p>
<h3>Silk Market: To Be Seized by Rayon; Different Views Between the British and Americans</h3>
<p>[Reuters, 30th, by Michael Smale] American sources recently expressed the opinion that the pre-war silk market has been permanently seized by rayon, and believe that if silk can continue to gain a foothold in the Western market, it should quickly take advantage of the current shortage of fabrics. However, British silk merchants do not agree. Manufacturers here point out that similar speculation occurred after the First World War, when rayon was still in its early stages of development. However, between 1924 and 1939, silk consumption increased sevenfold. According to a director of a merchant firm here, butter and margarine are similar situations. Citizens buy the latter because there is more of it, not because it is cheaper. Similarly, if silk production is relatively abundant and prices are fair, it is inevitable that citizens will choose silk over rayon.</p>
<h3>Floating Capital Favors the Gold Market; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both See Decline</h3>
<p>Although Chinese stocks showed signs of activity, the speculative power focused on gold, and the efforts were insufficient. They had no choice but to continue to sell stocks and buy gold. At the same time, the gold market was booming, and those who borrowed money to play the stock market were forced to cover their positions urgently. Under these two-pronged circumstances, the chips finally loosened. After opening, there was a rebound. Yongsheng Yarn reached a high of 6,100 yuan, Meiya 5,100 yuan, Jingfu 505 yuan, Xinguang 440 yuan, and Qinxing 345 yuan. Subsequently, they fell into a gradual decline. Near noon, the low prices were Yongsheng Yarn 5,600 yuan, Meiya 4,700 yuan, Jingfu 465 yuan, Xinguang 395 yuan, and Qinxing 315 yuan. Then it stabilized slightly. The noon closing was generally flat compared to the previous closing. Xinguang, Qinxing, Xinhe, Zhongfang, Da Zhonghua, and Rongfeng all saw slight increases. Some stock market players tended towards smaller old stocks, choosing cheap ones. Both the Sino-French Underwear Company saw rises due to people buying them up. However, Xin Asia failed to enjoy the same treatment due to the absence of the leader. Old stocks continued to make progress. The situation with foreign stocks was no exception. Floating capital was flowing rapidly towards gold. Yisha once broke through the 15 mark, resulting in a decline of about half a percent compared to the previous closing. The scattered asking prices in the aftermarket slightly increased the prices of both Chinese and foreign stocks.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Revival</h3>
<p>The tea market, which was on its last breath, gradually saw a revival yesterday. The old goods of various qualities, in addition to the Suzhou merchants continuing to quietly absorb them, also saw increased demand from Tianjin and other regions. At the same time, local shops also saw sporadic sales. Prices, however, remained stagnant. According to news from Tianjin merchants, they are planning to start a large-scale purchase of green tea soon, collecting as much as possible. As for the new Longjing tea, the supply continues to arrive, but the market sentiment remains stable. However, due to the varying quality, the transaction volume was lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaken Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of the rayon market fluctuated uncertainly and eventually declined. No. 120 Tianjin Bridge opened at 1.8 million yuan and closed at 1.77 million yuan. It had previously been bid at 1.82 million yuan, but it was even lower in the afternoon, trading at 1.7 million yuan, which was 150,000 yuan less than the previous day. Factory silk, with a high uniformity of 81 points from foreign firms, was offered at 2.58 million yuan, but the rest was generally flat. However, the general sentiment was quite weak. The silk goods market saw slight increases in prices yesterday. Meiya quilt covers rose by 40,000 yuan per hundred, and Dacheng checkered crepe rose by 30 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market Slightly Firmer</h3>
<p>Commodity prices have generally been trending upward in recent weeks, but tung oil has remained unchanged. Although market sentiment has been slightly firmer, it cannot withstand the repeated telegram reports of price drops in the Hankou market. Yesterday, a telegram from Hankou stated that white tung oil had fallen, reportedly to 50,500 yuan, and the situation remained depressed. Therefore, even if the Hangzhou market appears tight due to scarce supply, prices will still flatten out if the supply increases slightly. Shenxing currently sells white tung oil at 72,000 yuan per dan, West Auxiliary Hongjiang oil at 85,000 yuan per barrel, and local Hong oil at 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Orders About to Arrive</h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market remained flat and weak yesterday. Apart from some sporadic sales of seasonal summer white goods, there were no significant transactions. Standard prices mostly remained unchanged. News from Baoda Foreign Firm indicated that the foreign goods initially ordered would arrive in Shanghai in succession within ten days. Therefore, those who placed orders in the industry are all buying US dollar tickets. It is reported that most of the goods being shipped are seasonal goods for autumn and winter sales.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Loan of 20 Billion; Planned Purchase of 80,000 Dan of Dried Cocoons; Worth US$20-30 Million</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Office's cocoon loan, approved by President Song, is 20 billion yuan. It is designated that, in addition to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, the loan can be co-managed by the China Trust and Savings Bureau and commercial banks in Shanghai, which can form a syndicate to provide loans in shares. The syndicate will jointly form this year's Spring Cocoon Management Office with the China Silk Company, assigning staff to various cocoon-producing areas to closely supervise the loan's approval, recovery, auditing, and collateral management to prevent the loan from being used for other purposes. The cocoon collection business will be handled by the China Silk Company in conjunction with various factories in their respective producing areas. As for the price of cocoon collection, it will be calculated based on the actual cost of the cocoon farmers, plus a legitimate profit, so that cocoon farmers can benefit from this cocoon price to encourage rural industry production.</p>
<p>To reduce manufacturers' production costs, the loan management office plans to negotiate with the fuel authorities to allocate fuel coal to factories at official prices. It is reported that the China Silk Company will be responsible for manufacturing technical guidance to improve the quality of raw silk in various factories. Cocoons with diseased silkworms will not be purchased and will be burned immediately to prevent adulteration and maintain standard quality.</p>
<p>As the cocoon season approaches, the syndicate is actively preparing and will be established in the coming days. The loan management office plans to start operations in early May. This year, the planned purchase amount of cocoons is 80,000 dan of dried cocoons (equivalent to 240,000 dan of fresh cocoons). According to the silk industry, these 80,000 dan of dried cocoons can produce 17,000 to 20,000 dan of raw silk (the cost of raw materials, processing fees, etc., for each dan of silk is approximately 2.5 million yuan; the current Shanghai price is 2.7 million yuan (referring to 83 points)). At the current New York silk market price of US$11.50 to US$12 per pound for 83-point silk, the total sales value can be US$20 to 30 million. Therefore, after the loan is approved and issued, it will greatly benefit the replenishment of foreign exchange reserves.</p>

<h3>The Inevitable White Man (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Original by Jack London, Translated by 鲁莽 (Lǔmǎng)</p>
<p>"The four sailors, including Sachsdoff, were scrubbing the stern deck. The fifth sailor, holding a rifle, was standing guard near the water filler at the base of the main mast. I was going to add some water to the jib boom. Just as I was walking to get the water hose, I heard a gunshot from the shore. I stood up and looked. Something hit the back of my head, almost knocking me out and knocking me to the deck. I immediately realized something was happening; but just before I was knocked to the deck, I heard the rifle fire on the rowboat, and quickly turning my head, I only caught a glimpse of the sailor standing guard. Two big black men were holding his arms, and another black man was chopping his head with a battle axe from behind.</p>
<p>"I can still see clearly now, the water filler, the main mast, the group holding him, the axe chopping his head from behind, and everything shining in the sunlight. I was imagining that death. It seemed to take a very long time for the axe to come down. I watched it come down, and the legs in the water buckled and squatted down. The two black men held him up, and he was chopped twice more. Then I was chopped twice more in the head, and I certainly thought I was dead. The bastards who chopped me must have thought so too. I had no strength to move, and I lay there watching them cut off the guard's head. I must say they did it very quickly. They were old hands at this sort of thing.</p>
<p>"The rifle fire on the rowboat had stopped, and I was sure they were out of bullets and everything was over. It was only a matter of time before they came back to chop off my head. They were clearly taking the sailors' heads on the stern. Heads are valuable in Malaita, especially white men's heads. They have their respected places in the saltwater natives' canoe houses. I don't know what special decorative effect the jungle natives get from them, but they value them as much as the saltwater natives.</p>
<p>"I had a vague intention of escaping, so I used my hands and elbows to crawl to the edge of the winch, where I managed to pull myself up. From there I could see the stern and saw three heads on top of the cabin—the heads of the sailors who had been taking my orders for months. The black men saw me stand up and charged at me. I reached for my pistol and found they had taken it. I can't say I was afraid. I had been close to death several times, but it seemed I had never been closer than this time. I was half dizzy and it seemed nothing mattered.</p>
<p>"The leading black man was armed with a butcher knife from the ship's kitchen, and he made an ugly face like an orangutan as he prepared to cut me down. But that was never accomplished. He suddenly fell to the deck, and I saw blood gushing from his mouth. I vaguely heard a rifle firing and continuing to fire. The black men fell one after another. My consciousness began to clear, and I noticed that every shot hit. Every time the rifle fired, a black man fell. I sat down on the deck, beside the winch, and looked up. Hidden in the masthead was Sachsdoff. How he managed to climb up there, I can't imagine, because he took two Winchester rifles up with him, and I don't know how many ammunition belts; and now he was doing the only thing in the world he was suited to do.</p>
<p>"I saw the shooting and slaughter, but I had never seen anyone shoot like him. I sat by the winch and watched the scene. I was weak and a little dizzy, and it all seemed like a dream. Bang, bang, bang, bang, his rifle firing, Pak, pak, pak, pak, black men falling to the deck. It was a little surprising to see them fall. After they charged at me, about a dozen had fallen, and they seemed paralyzed; but he never stopped working his gun. At this time, many canoes and two rowboats came over from the coast, carrying breech-loading rifles and Winchester rifles, which they had seized from the two rowboats. They all fired rapidly at Sachsdoff, which was truly extraordinary. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Impressions of Two Exhibitions</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐 (Wēn Zhàotóng)</p>
<p>1. The First Joint Exhibition of the Shanghai Art Writers Association</p>
<p>Painting is the use of a certain medium to express the author's emotions, thoughts, and imagination. The choice of medium is only a necessary means of expression, and it is by no means a mechanical determination that only brushes, ink, and rice paper should be used for painting within the country, and anything else is a radical innovation. We can prove this with the First Joint Exhibition of the Shanghai Art Writers Association held at the Daxin Gallery from the 22nd of last month.</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the Shanghai Art Writers Association each used their favorite materials to create paintings, including so-called Chinese painting, oil painting, watercolor, sketches, woodcuts, cartoons, and patterns. We did not feel that everything other than Chinese painting was inappropriate. On the contrary, we can see that each author carefully selected materials and carefully used the tools to achieve the effect of artistic expression.</p>
<p>In the First Joint Exhibition, we can also clearly distinguish two major types of artistic tendencies. One type is the works of writers who returned to Shanghai from the inland areas, which are full of a realistic atmosphere. The other type is the writers who stayed in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War, who are working on the skills of expression.</p>
<p>The former, because they have experienced actual life, made the content of painting absolutely exclude fantasy. At the same time, in their works, what we should pay more attention to is the establishment of a new expression technique that abandons Chinese and Western paintings. There are firm and dense lines, as well as the light and color of yin and yang, and even a grand and magnificent style. It seems that it has reached the path of creation, and is an emerging national painting. Because the content is close to reality, perhaps it is quite appropriate to call it New Realist Painting. This may not be the new life that the Anti-Japanese War gave to art. If the works of the writers who stayed in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War are compared with the former only in terms of content, most of the works feel insufficient. However, the cultivation of skills is, after all, an important factor in artistic expression. Therefore, we should also pay attention to the works that are composed of superb and excellent techniques, forgiving their inability to expand their scope of life.</p>
<p>2. Zhang Naiyi's Oil Painting Solo Exhibition</p>
<p>Zhang Naiyi's oil paintings exhibited at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association are following a road of technical research, and are also following the road taken by the emerging paintings of the early twentieth century in Europe. From the perspective of artistic research, it is correct and gratifying not to take the path of rigid and dull depictions of form.</p>
<p>The philosopher Nietzsche once distinguished art into two major types of opposition, namely, the Apollo type and the Dionysus type. The former expresses reason, while the latter expresses emotion. Cézanne, Derain, Picasso, and others can be included in the former type, while Matisse and Vlaminck belong to the latter type. The former often constructs works through careful thinking, while the latter is often an expression of momentary emotions. Therefore, rational art emphasizes form, while emotional art emphasizes color.</p>
<p>Because Zhang has a precious talent, a keen sense, and abundant emotions, his works often tend to be spontaneous works made up of a unique composition of colors. In the words of Chinese painters, it is: "What is meant by being born unintentionally is often when one concentrates one's spirit and thoughts, looks around and moves one's wrist, and at first does not intend to be like this, but suddenly it is like this. If it is said to be sufficient, then it is not really sufficient; if it is said to be insufficient, then there is nothing to add. It is uniquely obtained outside of the sentiment and interest of the brush and ink, which is the bursting forth of the heavenly opportunity." - Zhang Geng's "Pushan on Painting," so it should be included in the category of emotion. "Dahlias," Wang Lan, "River Trees," etc., are indeed clear evidence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Zhang only devotes himself to color and brushwork, and his grasp of the sense of form seems to be insufficient. We hope that Zhang will do more research on sketching, especially research on human body composition. If you do not want to deny that art should be close to reality, then strong form, plus sufficient color and brushwork, with such an expressive effect, will it become the most excellent painting.</p>
<h3>Double Flying Together (31)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>Since Old Master Mo passed away, the Mo family has been at peace!</p>
<p>Madam Mo no longer has anyone to quarrel with, and there is nothing in this house that she dislikes or hates! Life is so peaceful that she sometimes feels lonely, perhaps even a little uneasy. This unease stems from her understanding that Old Master Mo's illness was caused by her; during his illness, she did not fulfill even the slightest responsibility of care; and even after his death, she initially did not shed a single tear, only sobbing a few times because she saw the children crying so sadly. However, she would never tell anyone about these feelings. Moreover, she constantly complained about how Old Master Mo had wronged her when he was alive. These complaints aroused the children's dissatisfaction, and Bao Ling once protested to her, saying, "No matter how bad Dad was, he is dead now, so stop constantly complaining about him!" Bao Ling's words made her quite ashamed! She knew that the children could not forgive her indifference towards Old Master Mo. In order to win over the children's affections, she henceforth avoided mentioning Old Master Mo. She secretly repented to Old Master Mo while concentrating her efforts on reorganizing the household affairs.</p>
<p>The children lost Old Master Mo, and each of them was like a lost lamb. Especially Li Hua, she would start to cry as soon as she picked up a book! She hadn't finished reciting "The Daughter's Classic" before Old Master Mo left her! No one else taught her, and Bao Ling was rarely at home, and was neither as patient as Old Master Mo, nor could he explain things as clearly as Old Master Mo. In addition, Madam Mo forbade her from studying and wanted her to learn needlework together with Li Yun, so she severed her connection with books from then on! All this made her unhappy and made her deeply mourn Old Master Mo!</p>
<p>Bao Ling was about to graduate from junior high school. Originally, when Old Master Mo was alive, he had promised him that he would let him finish junior high school and go on to senior high school no matter what. Graduating from senior high school was equivalent to being a "Juren" in the late Qing Dynasty, and then he could become a teacher and support himself. Because Old Master Mo did not want his son to follow in his own footsteps, he never planned to let Bao Ling go into government service after graduating from senior high school. Bao Ling understood Old Master Mo's intentions. Old Master Mo's painful confession seven years ago had been firmly engraved in Bao Ling's mind and had deeply influenced him. Therefore, he piously decided to fulfill Old Master Mo's expectations in the future. However, now Old Master Mo was dead! Old Master Mo and his own fantasies had all turned into bubbles! He could no longer go on to senior high school, as Madam Mo had already stated that he would not continue his education after finishing junior high school. Because there was not enough money to support his education, he could not become a teacher, and naturally, there was no question of "entering government service." But what was he going to do? He was very confused! He was also very distressed! So since Old Master Mo passed away, he left early and returned late, spending all day in school. On the one hand, he wanted to make the most of this brief educational opportunity to study hard; on the other hand, he was afraid to go home, back to that house without Old Master Mo!</p>

<h3>Education Loan Still Not Received Student Letter Questions Association, Requests Public Reply</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: I am a student, and today I am saying a few words from a third party perspective:</p>
<p>I started registering for this "Education Loan" before the start of this semester, but so far there has been no news. Now the second installment of tuition has increased again. The "Education Loan" that I have been eagerly waiting for has not been issued yet. Many poor students are worried about not being able to pay their tuition. I do not know when they will be able to receive their expected "Education Loan". Please answer, has the "Education Loan" been fully issued? Furthermore, the school has issued blank receipts for the "Education Loan" to the general beneficiaries, asking them to fill them out, and also requiring parents and guarantors to sign and seal them, and they have been informed of the specified amount of assistance. The general beneficiaries thought that they could get the money as soon as they submitted the receipts, but they have been waiting for about a month and there is still no news. What does this mean? The "money" has not been received, but they are busy writing receipts first. Is this what the "Education Loan Committee" has specified? (Reader: Ji Si)</p>
<p>Reply: We have received your letter of April 23, along with a letter from reader Ji Si. Thank you for your kindness. After investigation, the applications for loans from students in various schools have been approved and entrusted to the schools for distribution. If the student knows that a certain student has completed all the procedures and the school has not forwarded the loan, please provide the real name and the school attended, and we will thoroughly investigate. This is a reply to the Social Services Department of Shen Bao (attached return letter). Respectfully, Zhou Feicheng.</p>
<h3>Replies to Readers</h3>
<p>Wang Jingquan asks: My nose is often blocked, and there are green sticky clumps with a fishy odor. I have suffered from this disease for nearly ten years. I first consulted at the Red Cross Hospital, and they said it was atrophic rhinitis. At that time, there was no radical cure in medicine and it did not affect my health. I would like to ask if there is now a cure and a specific medicine?</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]: There is no special treatment for atrophic rhinitis. Crusts and fishy odor can be treated with nasal washes, using a 3% saline solution. The crusts can be removed by a otolaryngologist using a nasal packing method, which often has miraculous effects. You can also try vitamin A, C, and D preparations, Prostiguim, and hormones.</p>
<p>Zhang Qiwei asks: My father suffered from severe neurasthenia before the war due to excessive work. He was treated by famous doctors in Nanjing, but he was not cured. When the war broke out, he fled to Lihuang, the provincial capital of Anhui. His illness was cured during the escape, so he continued to serve in the education field. Until last year, due to excessive work, the old illness relapsed. Because I think your newspaper has always been enthusiastic about social services and has a long and glorious history, I have listed the symptoms below and ask for a cure. If necessary, my father can also come to Shanghai for treatment. According to a friend, injections of Bayer's "Complon" (a) or "Optarson" can cure the disease and have special effects, but my father is very cautious, because he does not know their functions, he does not dare to use them rashly. Is it appropriate? I also ask for your advice.</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]: It is more certain to come to Shanghai for treatment. The two injections you mentioned can be tried. It is best to have a blood test to check the source of the disease. You can try sulfate preparations and Touophosphan injections first.</p>
<p>Cao Ming asks: I have had an eye disease for more than ten years. The symptoms include squint, nearsightedness, and astigmatism. I am afraid of strong sunlight during the day and often tear easily. Recently, I have found it very difficult to read newspapers and books. I would like to ask if there are any specialist ophthalmologists in Shanghai who can treat the above symptoms completely or not. How much will it cost approximately? Also, I am currently a soldier, and I will be engaged in education work after I retire, so my financial strength can be imagined.</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]: Strabismus can be treated with surgery, and astigmatism and nearsightedness can be corrected with glasses. Tearing and other symptoms may be caused by trachoma, which must be radically cured. Specialist ophthalmologists in Shanghai can be consulted. The cost of surgery should be discussed in person.</p>
<p>Lost Gold Ring: At around 7:30 AM on the 24th, on the Route 17 trolleybus at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangti Road, a lady found a gold ring and handed it to ticket seller number 173. The owner can report the style and weight to collect it from the trolleybus company.</p>
<p>Lost and Found Book: On the morning of the 27th, a reader found a junior high school new chemistry textbook on Jiaozhou Road and West Beijing Road. The name on the cover is "Tao Moli". Please claim it at the Social Services Department of this newspaper.</p>
