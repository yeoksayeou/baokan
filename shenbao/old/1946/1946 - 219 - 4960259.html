<h3>國務院發言人聲明美國對華政策不變否認計劃撤退在華美軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓五日電〕國務院發言人今日聲稱：南京傳來謂杜魯門總統已訓令馬歇爾元帥，計劃撤退在華美軍之謠諑，並不正確。發言人力稱：目前美國對華政策，仍一如代理國務卿艾克遜六月廿八日所宣布者，並無變更。發言人述及艾克遜曾表示不久將對中國局勢作一般檢討之言時稱：所謂「檢討」，並非必係變更政策之謂，惟對美國之立塲有所闡明而已。發言人在記者招待會中，拒絕說明何時可作「檢討」。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島六日電〕美第七艦隊總司令柯克大將返抵靑島總部之翌日，接見警備司令丁治磐，市長李先良等，下午一時半在ESTES旗艦見靑島記者羣，首對南京，牯嶺，上海之行，作一般之說明。繼述及安平事件，謂美軍在華誠須撤退，惟撤退時閱無定，尤不因安平事件而生何影響，今後各地美駐軍如再有被襲情事，美軍當採有效之還擊。末答記者問稱：安平受傷美兵三名，已坁靑就醫，並將通知傷者親屬。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津六日電〕華北美軍司令駱基少將昨晚稱：關於美軍準備撤離中國一事，迄未接到命令，但天津美軍數額確已减少。上月廿九日美兵遭狙擊事件發生後，美軍曾時常調動，某數地點之駐軍且已增强。目前天津美軍任務爲看守美軍財產，防護天津至秦皇島間之鐵路，平津公路以及其他各要衝之橋樑，此外，並担任辦理華北美軍補給事宜。至美軍家屬，現無來中國者，局勢雖屬嚴重，但相信華北美軍足能應付任何環境。天津美軍計包括戰軍隊及航空隊一隊，現正在加緊訓練，但唯一目的則爲使局勢安定及執行馬歇爾特使之計劃。</p>
<h3>調查程序爭議未決赴安平特別小組遲遲其行</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕軍調部所派調査大小沙河美軍被襲案之特別小組，今又未能出發，主要原因在程序之爭，小組安全問題北方允先派聯齡人員前往。所謂程序之爭，政府方面謂共方提議中共方先擬定調査程序案，據此程序，特別小組調査範圍，將包括冀東之甚多地區，美方反對。另據共產黨人稱：美方提議此調査程序須按照白魯德在南京時與三人會議商得之小組行動，可由美方代表以主席資格提出程序之協議，而仍由美方擬定，但共方則以此事件美方爲當事人，故應不受該協議之拘束，此問題今仍商談中。又三方均特別重視該小組代表人選，政府方面已改派執行處副處長鄧維仁。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平六日電〕軍調部特別小組組長台維斯上校，今日開始調査上月廿九日平津公路安平附近美軍與共軍衝空事件，以便決定則任誰屬。台氏已詢問該案有關美國軍官數人，另有生存之美兵數人，將於七日來平，以供査問。該小組係奉馬歇爾特使訓令組成，定八日或九日前往出事地點實地勘察。</p>

<h3>欲賡續和平談判須實施整軍方案主席明白表示政府態度</h3>
<p>司徒大使返京當晚晤周恩來</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺六日電〕司徒大使今晨九時離牯，至九江乘飛機返京，蔣主席派秘書沈昌煥伴送至九江。此次司徒大使離牯以前，抱有極大熱忱，希望盡其最大努力，打開目前之沉悶僵局。現牯嶺一般人士預料司徒大使返京後，國共和平談判前途，祇要共產黨能適時覺悟，對過去所談方案，歷次會議之商有成議者，拿出誠意，否則和平談判前途未可樂觀。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕司徒大使已於今日下午一時廿五分專機飛抵南京大較塲機塲，同來者有其私人顧問傳涇波。司徒大使新病初愈較離京時爲消瘦，惟精神尙佳，　顧問亦略顯淸瘦。大使着白色西服，携雨衣一襲，大使旋爲在塲之少數記者包圍訪問，未五分鐘，傳顧問即促其登車而去。茲誌大使答記者問如次：美軍離華一事，現尙不願發表任何談話，在牯嶺時，曾與主席晤談兩次，惟均談一般問題，未獲具體結果，至國共之和平談判，希望不爲任何其他事件所影響，談判前途，仍有希望，由司徒之談話中，記者並悉其二次與主席之談話中，曾涉及改組政府一事。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺六日電〕餍續和平商談，乃司徒雷登大使六日晨離牯赴京之抱負，大使此次在牯，前後旅居幾十日，對共黨製造之安平事件，渠始終主張不能因「變態影響常態」，雖在病中，猶未忘其爲和平商談而奔走之使命，觀其與蔣主席馬歇爾元帥就安平事件，及和平商談連續晤談多次之後，在美國輿論及國務院支持之下，挾其爲中國友人熱情，不計新病初愈，再僕僕於氣溫相差二十度之京牯間，或能恢宏其抱負，而使我國局勢進入新階段。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺六日電〕聞司徒雷登大使離牯前，已自蔣主席方面獲得表示：賡續和平商談，仍應以實施旣定之整軍方案與恢復交通爲當急之務。政府方面對此兩案，實施之決心與進度，早有具體事實表現。共產黨如仍以製造新事件爲不實施舊定案之掩護，實自閉賡續和平商談之門，自絕馬歇爾元帥與司徒大使之奔走斡旋。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕司徒大使抵京後，於下午即邀約周恩來晤談，周氏偕同共產黨代表王炳南，於晚七時赴美國大使館，並同進晚餐，餐後，即就其面臨草坪之會客室內，開始其談判，在座者爲司徒大使，及其私人顧問傳涇波，共產黨代表周恩來及王炳南，又另一人担任紀錄，共五人，談話迄午夜十二時七分畢。據共產黨代表團發言人表示，談話經過時間甚長，內容深刻，雙方態度直率，主要在交換目前重要問題之意見，並涉及若干基本問題，然均未作結論，擬　星期四馬帥返京時，再行續談。聞此次談話中，司徒大使曾將與蔣主席在牯嶺所談之意見轉達周氏。衆信此項會談自必以安平事件及和平商談爲主要內容，明日是否再談，現尙未定，惟馬師返京後，當進行進一步之會談也。</p>
<p>〔衆社南京六是電〕共黨發言人王炳南今日透露消息稱；周恩來將於今晚與美駐華大使司徒需登共餐，聽　蔣主席對於共黨所提遵照政協決議，「無條件停戰」，並改組政府各項要求之答復。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>國際民主與世界和平</h3>
<p>歐洲和會開會一週，聽取廿一國代表相機發表演說，陳述各國對於戰後國際政治所抱見解，廿一國不分大小，不論強弱，均有自由發表意見的同等機會，並受到其他各國的同等重視，這富麗堂皇的盧森堡宮，一時竟成了公開的國際論壇，不能不說是近代國際政治的一大進步，同時也可以視為國際民主化的先聲。美國國務卿貝爾納斯在巴黎得意洋洋的說：「刺刺和會的主要目的，乃在使各國代表儘量發表意見，故余主張四強應讓其他十七國優先發表其對於和約草案之見解；余並要求審查和約草案之五種委員會均應由四強以外其他國家之代表充任主席。」我們聽了這一番開明的談話，幾乎使我們相信，戰後的國際政治已進入和平民主的新時代，國家不論大小強弱，亦不問其對於大戰的貢獻如何，對於國際政治，均有同等發言的機會；而素為吾人所深惡痛絕的強權政治，即將成為時代的陳跡了。</p>
<p>但是當和會進入第二週之後，代表演說告一段落，即將開始和會的實際工作；而亟待解决的程序問題，更是刻不容緩的了。前天，和會程序委員會開會，討論及表决的方法與手續時，各國的意見紛歧，就發生了極大的爭執，幾乎無法妥協；尤其是蘇聯外長莫洛托夫堅持成見，不肯讓步，不但反對英荷兩國對於和會程序所提出的修正案，而且猛烈抨擊美國代表的態度，前後矛盾。使程序委員會中的空氣，頓時緊張起來。在表面上看起來，這個程序，僅是蘇聯與英美意見不合，也就是蘇聯主張建議，須經和會三分二多數通過，始能成立；而英美方面認為只要經過和會多數通過，也就可以成立了。如果是這樣的，問題並不複雜，也沒有重大意義可言，更不必過分重視，這不過是蘇聯與英美的利害衝突而已，但是在實際上，這是大國與小國平等不平等的問題，也就是國際民主不民主的問題，所以世界各國尤其是中小各國，對此均極重視，且多堅持原議，不肯讓步，頗有使和會陷於僵局的可能。</p>
<p>但是我們要問，蘇聯爲什麽要堅持和會通過一切決議均須得三分二多數贊成呢？研究一下出席和會二十一國代表之成份，就不難完全了解了。因為蘇聯在國際上雖處於領導地位，但是和她志同道合的國家比較少，所以在任何國際會議中，很容易遭遇到「孤掌難鳴」的痛苦；但是怎樣維持其在國際上的特殊地位足與英美等量齊觀呢？因此乃想出一種「以少數控制多數」的巧妙辦法，在舊金山會議時，蘇聯曾堅决主張會議程序，應採取三分二的多數辦法，對於聯合國憲章，更要求安全理事會常任理事國得行使「否決權」，自聯合國大會成立以來，蘇聯動輒行使否決權，已使英美方面痛心疾首，不得不在國際上發起取消「否決權」運動。在這次和會中，也有五六國的代表，唯蘇聯馬首是瞻，同時還有若干國代表，處於蘇聯與英美之間，徘徊瞻顧，暫不採取固定立場，當和會將提議付諸表决時，蘇聯如表示異議，不希望這個建議成立，蘇聯不難獲得三分一國家的附議，從中作梗，使其無法成立。如此，凡為蘇聯所不同意的建議，也就不會成立。反之，此在英美方面，在這次廿一國和會中，雖處處佔着優勢，但是欲取得多數終比較三分二容易，所以主張採取多數表决辦法，但為對蘇聯表示讓步起見，英國又主張這兩種辦法，即多數表決與三分二多數，兼採並用，俾能顧及雙方的利益，殊不了竟遭到蘇聯代表的堅决反對？在會議中引起爭執。</p>
<p>本報社論在和會開幕的一天，就向與會各國代表進言，希望和會採取民主的方法，以締造世界和平。我們仍本着這個願望，檢討和會所當採取之程序，凡是不合民主原則的任何辦法，均表示異議，我們雖然熱望和會進行順利能夠獲得成功，但是不贊成委曲求全的辦法，只遵重四強的主張，而忽視小國的意見，對義，芬，羅，匈，保五國和約，旣已由四強外長起草，如在不願接受小國的意見，則和會即喪失其召開的意義，不能不認為四強，不過假和會的形式來簽訂和約而已，一切决定權都操在四強的手裏，和過去歷次大戰後所召開的和會，完全相同，何况在今日四強之間，意見殊不一致，僅在和會的程序問題上就可以看出一般來了，這樣的和會怎能完成其締造永久的合理的和平之任務？荷蘭代表說：「任何對於中小各國利益不公平的辦法，均足以妨害國際社會的和平發展。」澳外長伊瓦特更代表中小各國發言，要求和會採取民主的公開的方式，進行各項問題的檢討。這些小國代表的呼聲，都是值得各國代表深思的。</p>
<p>要而言之，國際的民主，一天不能實現，則真正的世界和平，即一天不能締成；此次廿一國和會的目的，雖在締造歐洲局部的和平，但其對於將來世界整個的和平，有着極密切的關係，戰後的世界能否步入和平民主的新時代，這次巴黎會議就是在世界前途中的一個新考驗。</p>

<h3>和會現程委員會席上　美蘇代表舌劍唇鎗　表決制問題仍未獲結果</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎六日廣播：和會規程委員會本日開會，莫洛托夫繼貝爾納斯後發言，依然堅持三分二之票決制度，聲稱，在舊金山會議即採用此種方式，蘇聯代表團決不能接受以十一票決定各項建議之辦法。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯與蘇外長莫洛托夫，今日在和會規程委員會席上發生衝突。貝爾納斯指責蘇聯企圖經由四強號令大會，莫洛托夫則答以四強為美國之觀念。貝爾納斯於答覆莫洛托夫指責矛盾一節，宣讀種種記錄，要求莫洛托夫明瞭貝氏之言論曾在蘇聯發表，一如莫氏之言論在美國發表然。莫洛托夫旋即發言，再度指責矛盾，並稱，貝爾納斯以嚴重與發怒之語調發言。按今日裝個辯論，乃為大會議案經三分之二多數抑或過半數表決規則一項問題所引起。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕美國無情巴爾納斯今日在此聲稱：蘇聯自波茨坦會議以來，即擬將參加和會之各國代表，儘可能限制至最少數，而蘇外長莫洛托夫企圖使英美法蘇四國外長會議左右和會代表。貝氏係在和會規程委員會致詞，對莫洛托夫昨日發言指責美國贊助加拿大建議外長會議與和會同時舉行，予以答覆，稱：「和會召開以來，本人未發一言，以責辯蘇聯代表所抱立場，亦從未對蘇聯代表之動機，有所質問。然昨聞莫洛托夫之言，頗為驚詫」。嗣規程委員會再度開會，對劇烈爭辯之表決手續提出討論。烏克蘭外長曼紐爾斯基發言，請各代表擁護四國通過之三分二多數表決規則稱，烏克蘭顯見多數決議案一致通過，如果不獲一致通過，則盼望最大多數通過，而三分之二多數表決至規則，最可反映前淪陷各國人民之希望云。同時，與捷克對西萊西亞之特申城週圍四百廿哩區域發生爭執，有使和會遭遇新的疆土問題之虞。據波蘭波蘭外長即該國和會代表團長勒莫斯基向報界談稱，該區因人種關係，不能讓予捷克，惟希望此一問題，可根據對捷克政府之友好諒解，取得解決云。上述區域人口廿四萬，多年前即起爭執，現由捷克主動，並無放棄「要求」之意。</p>
<h3>王外長表示意見　三分二票決可能引起僵局　中美等十三國支持英建議</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎五日電〕我國對表決程序問題之態度，已於本日規程委會中，由王世杰外長釋明，王外長於慎重考慮後宣稱，我國代表團認為上月巴黎四強外長所擬之三分二多數制，其有若干修正乃屬必需與合宜。王氏認為三分二多數制有其缺點，因採用此種表決制，可能在和會討論中引起如下之僵局，那可能使和會對和約草案中問題可能產生建議。另一方面，我國代表亦不贊同荷蘭所提普通多數表決制之建議，蓋其亦有缺點，由於過去之經騐，吾人必須在此等國際集會注意表決程序問題，倘和會決議由普通多數票產生，則此種和會之建議，僅得參加各國中較少之支持。王氏繼稱，我國代表團中擬提出一修正案，使和會之建議必須由絕對多數票決定之，此即過半數之票決。但我國研究英國之折衷建議後，認為我國原欲建議之主體，已包括在英國建議中，是故我國不再提出另修正案，而願支持英國之修正建議。</p>
<h3>組織小組會　研究修正案</h3>
<p>捷克建議卒遭否決</p>

<h3>納粹所奪黃金　昨運返匈京</h3>

<h3>芬蘭鋸木廠　神秘失火案</h3>
<p>〔路透社希爾辛基五日電〕入夏以來芬蘭之鋸木廠，已連續發生神秘失火案多起，此等木材均係作為對蘇賠款者，因此其黨乃指此乃法西斯份子所為。按芬蘭和約草案規定芬蘭應以價值三萬萬美元之實物價給蘇聯，芬蘭政府深覺負担過重，而鋸木廠之失火，益使芬蘭經濟蒙受　重大損失</p>
<h3>暹羅正式申請　加入聯合國</h3>

<h3>猶太人團體　向和會提備忘錄</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕美國猶太人協會，英國猶太人公會，暨全世界猶太人大會，本日聯合以備忘錄一件，送達巴黎和會，要求使·保匈·義·羅四國境內之猶太人，恢復一切權利。備忘錄中指出上述諸國若干區域內猶太人地位，遠較其他人民為低，反猶太人之情緒亦更見緊張。要之，凡以前各敵國應保證取締一切對於猶太人之歧視，猶太人更當恢復戰前所有之自由及財產。各國疆界如有改變·猶太人應得自行選擇國籍云。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫前日發表　爆炸性演辭內容　堅決反對英荷修正案　指責美代表態度矛盾</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕和會規程委員會頃　續開會，蘇外長莫洛托夫發表演說，堅決反對英荷兩國對於和會規程所提出之修正案，並猛烈抨擊美代表態度自相矛盾，幾使規程委員會陷於決裂。其言略謂，四國外長會議所提之建議，規定和會通過一切決議，均須得三分二之多數贊成，此項建議應予以接受，抑且此種會議程序在舊金山會議時業經採用，成效卓著，此際何以不能獲得同等成功，實屬費解</p>
<p>任何決議經三分二贊成通過，世界各民主國即可認此為已獲得全體一致之同意，因此四國外長會議亦曾考慮及此。至於英代表所提出之修正案，主張兼採並用多數表决與三分二多數兩種辦法，實與四國外長會議之決議相違背，故不能接受。各國代表因均得自由發表意見，為其見解有所辯護，但須前後一致，但今日贊成多數表決，明日主張三分二多數，不啻自相矛盾，美代表即坐是病。美國務卿貝爾納斯曰，外長會議所通過之決議，並不能限制和會討論此項決議之權限，此言甚是，外長會議所未能討論之問題，和會亦可討論之。四國外長固能自由討論，但必須擁護旣經決定之事項，按余於上月卅日建議四強外長應在和會期間舉行會議，貝爾納斯對此亦曾表示同意，但至此際忽變初衷</p>
<p>加拿大代表提出此項建議，美代表曾表示同意，但至蘇代表提出時即表示異議。法國人民報曾載有一文，內稱英美兩國似顯和會採取多數表決辦法，良以此事對於英美有利故也，此言甚是，在聯合國之中如不能獲得全體一致之意見，則採用多數表決辦法固亦可謂已足夠，但仍不能強制少數方面信服，世界輿論至今未能了解此項態度，頗可扼腕。現出席和會之國家曾遭法西斯蹂躪者僅有九國，此即蘇聯白俄羅斯烏克蘭法國波蘭阿比西尼亞捷克希臘暨南斯拉夫等九國是也。如若採取多數表決，則受難各國均將成為少數，故余對此決不能表示同意。吾人如何投票一項問題尚不能決定，但吾人應設法保持聯合國間之統一，以及維持和平。美代表謂和會所當討論之問題，共計廿六個，或者尚有新的問題提出，四國外長會議所決定之程序亦曾攷慮及此，但若和會採取多數表決辦法，則徒增意見上之紛歧而已。保持和平最佳之辦法，乃在逃避好戰者所設陷阱，三分二多數能使吾人比較容易達到此項目標，但為多數表決通過之建議，亦應得外長會議之注意。最後余主張各國代表，均有向外長會議提議之權。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦分治計劃　阿猶族均表拒絕　予圓桌會議重大打擊　英靜待華府宣示態度</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕關於應該對於巴勒斯坦新擬定之計劃，猶太　　國委會執委會，本日午後開會討論此事，一致表示反對，並說明其理由：（一）英國計劃旣不使阿拉伯獨立，亦不使猶太獨立，省政府之制度，因其所有重要之特權，甚至省之立法權，亦在英國駐巴勒斯坦高級委員管轄之下，省長亦由高級委員任命，故此種制度，不啻自欺欺人。（二）依照英國計劃，剝奪猶太人在巴勒斯坦之聚居地百分之八十五，抑且猶太人對於其餘領土百分之十五殖民問題，並無控制權。（三）猶太人自治省面積，以視一九三七年比爾計劃所擬組織之猶太國為小。（四）英國計劃並未提供保證，且無決定性質。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕巴黎之猶太協會執委會已決定拒絕以巴勒斯坦之分治計劃為談判之基礎，此間人士認為此乃召開倫敦圓桌會議以討論巴勒斯坦問題一議之重大打擊。阿拉伯聯盟　亦已表示拒絕該一計劃，故圓桌會議即使舉行，巴勒斯坦分省計劃亦已無提付討論之可能。杜魯門總統對於分治計劃，迄未表示意見，今者猶阿兩族均已表示拒絕，則美政府之態度恐亦以表示反對之可能性為大。政界人士預料英內閣於週三開會討論整個巴勒斯坦問題時，美方之正式答覆當可提出。</p>
<p>蘇聯抨擊　英美政策</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕莫斯科電台今日用英語廣播，猛烈抨擊英美劃分巴勒斯坦計劃，並謂不藉聯合國機構之助，而欲解決巴勒斯坦問題，必無成效。此為蘇聯對英美方案之初次評論。該電台並稱，巴勒斯坦人民希望和平獨立之心，不能由此種方案獲得滿足·數百萬人民政懐着希望，注　巴黎和會工作，若輩必自問巴拉斯坦所發生之事，是否與建設持久和平及確保各民族權利平等之原則相符，愛好自由各國固曾為此平等權利而共同對軸心侵略者作戰云。</p>

<h3>國際法庭昨開始審理　日侵我關內事件　兩足殘廢之鮑威爾續扶杖到庭　前宛平縣長王冷齊亦出席作證</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京六日專電〕國際法庭六日晨開庭後，首由檢察處宣讀我國檢察官向哲濬簽署之起訴書，內載日本對我之侵略，溯自一九三二年之淞滬戰役起，以迄戰事結束止，共分四期，南京大屠殺案在起訴書內，特別予以在意。我檢察官向哲濬及美檢察官薩登，對日人迫害我國人民，尤其對日人以鴉片及麻醉品危害我國人民之罪行，將提出詳細之控告。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京六日電〕遠東國際法庭已將日侵東北時間審理終結，今日起開始審理日本對中國其他各地之武力侵略，由檢察官摩洛作陳述稱：此次所提陳述，所涉範圍及於日對東北以外其餘中國全土，挾近代陸海空軍，以征服及劫掠為目的，從事有計劃之軍事攻擊及軍事侵略之全部。東北之衝突，終蔓延至上海。一九三二年一月廿八日，日軍在上海之攻擊，乃其侵略東北之衍生物。該時日軍遭遇。</p>
<p>十九路軍之長期抵抗，停戰協定於同年五月五日成立。第二次侵略於五年後發動，該次與第一次侵略同，戰鬥行為於半夜開始先是中日二軍於一九三七年七月七日在盧溝橋衝突，事變急遽發展，北平遭日軍襲擊陷落，華軍被迫向西撤退。同年八月十三日，日軍於上海開始第二次進攻，京滬間一片沃野，為不宣而戰之侵略戰爭所蹂躪，致歸於荒廢。此次作戰，隨日軍之占領南京，達於絕頂，南京市民慘遭刺刀，機槍，殺戮，造成令人戰慄之故事，其暴戾恣虐，自匈奴阿帝拉以來，未有更甚於此者。又被俘中國軍人，不分皂白，悉遭殺害。松井，畑兩大將及其他將領所行諸作戰，沿鐵路綫及河岸進攻，中國沿海為日海軍所封鎖。日艦溯江而上，助陸軍進攻，日機則轟炸中國各都市。</p>
<p>侵略戰爭達最高潮時，中國東部二萬萬五千萬人，被置於日陸海軍支配之下。日人於一九四〇年三月三十日樹立偽南京政權以前，被俘中國軍人之監禁及處理辦法，迄無正式規定。比較中日兩方之統計，可知在此四年戰爭期間，中國方面之生死不明者，實達百萬人，此即慘遭日軍俘殺之數，尚有四十一萬一千人未算在內。死傷合計三百廿一萬七千九百四十人，（中國方面統計）。一九四一年十二月八日，日軍在滬發動第三次侵略，進入前公共租界掩捕英美人，加以收容。日對華進行軍事侵略起見，當中國非戰鬥員所作犯罪，榮當後述。實行該軍事侵略之全部被告，均對上述戰事負有犯罪責任。陳述畢，密勒氏評論報主筆鮑威爾再登證人席，答檢察官摩洛之直接訊問，陳述二次。</p>
<p>淞滬戰役情况稱：第一次淞滬戰役時，余曾見多數驅逐艦運送軍隊在虹口方面登陸，及飛機在閘北方面轟炸。虹口，楊樹浦，閘北方面之激戰，繼續至五月間。該次初由海軍作戰，其後陸軍亦行參加。進占北站時，曾使用鐵甲車，陸軍携來坦克車及重砲，海軍則由巡洋艦開砲射擊。日本官吏曾力謀解決，現在此處之重光，當時任上海總領事，渠尤為努力。日軍第二次襲擊上海，係屬陸軍之作戰，在吳淞登陸，沿長江進攻，在京滬杭三角地帶發展。余瞥見蘇州受創甚巨，十二座村落全毀。日軍第三次侵略上海，幾與日軍之偷襲珍珠港同時發生，英砲艦貝特萊兩號被擊沉，美砲艦威克號被俘，前公共租界為日海軍部隊所占領。鮑氏述畢，即由美籍辯護人范　斯反問：上海於第一次侵略前，發生衝突事件，乃由美·英·義·德·日等國組織萬國商團駐守各區，該商團成立理由之一，是否由於上海近郊十九路軍之策動？（答）十九路軍軍長蔡廷楷氏對東北事變頗有強烈感情。（問）日軍是否係於擊敗華軍後，進入一定地區，從事侵略中國地方？（答）然。（問）五月初作戰停止，成立停戰協定，惟日方是否於三月初即有欣然停戰之意？（答）有該計劃及行動。（問）淞滬停戰協定是否係設立一種中立地帶之協定？日軍是否確曾撤退？重光知否與英美方面密切協力？（答）然。重光並無如日軍之侵略意志，被曾竭力解決事件。鮑氏繼述日人在前虹口公園（現中正公園）慶祝停戰協定時，日酋百川大將等如何被人炸死？重光如何割去一脚？（問）證人知第一次上海事變前，滬上反日運動甚熾，而上海日僑二萬人，日本之上也非頗有危險乎？（答）大體如此。日人有三萬至五萬人。鮑氏復答檢察官杜伊斯之質詢，述前駐滬日憲兵隊之罪惡稱：一九四一年十二月二十日，上海報人悉被捕往日憲兵隊司令部，該處原係公寓，地下室監牢改造一如動物之籠，余被投入該牢內。該處共有十五室，室高十二尺，寬十八尺。一室內投入約四十人，因室小人多，衆人挨肩坐成一列。監房自一九三七年以來，即未加掃除，日憲兵對此毫不介意。食物一日僅得少量米飯三次，除早飯以外，似乎擱置數日，不堪入口。此外，每日有一次不知其名之液體。外間似有人送罐頭來獄，但未交與我等。關於醫療方面，有衛生兵及看護婦定期來訪。但除重症外，均不施治療。余入獄時，體重百四十五磅，出時減為七十磅。大部份人均感營養失調。衛兵曾用包裝貨物用之木片痛毆華人達八十五次。違反監獄規則時，即令人跪坐如日本式，面向東京禮拜，以表示向日皇道歉。我等被迫作書，詐稱康健，後被送往前江灣監獄，食物稍稍改良，因久坐地上，臀部生瘡，足部腫成黑色，其後因病症加重，乃經醫院施行手術，割去兩足。鮑氏證言畢，扶杖退庭。繼由盧溝橋事變時之宛平縣長王冷齊氏出庭作證，由檢察官宣讀證辭講：日軍佔據豐台後，控制平津交通，切斷北方與中央，　使華北成為特殊勢力範圍，並謀施用侵略東北慣技，欲不損一兵而佔領華北，於是開始所謂和平侵略。日方先此曾得北甯路局長陳覺生之協力，藉經營鐵路名義，測量豐台至盧溝橋間地帶。其後日方欲租借或收買該地帶，以建築兵營及機場，但均為我方所拒絕，日方乃知和平侵略之不可能，必須實行武力侵略，遂啟開盧溝橋事變之端。</p>
<h3>埃拒絕英撤兵條件　修約談判陷僵局</h3>

<h3>澈查行總工作範圍着重三電　各處儲藏倉庫昨起開始調查倉儲積貨正積極清除中</h3>
<p>行政監察兩院會同澈査行總之工作，前後已歷十二日，探悉：其澈査範圍着重三點：（一）關於行總之經費問題，及其經費之支配情况，（二）關於行總與聯總之合作情形及其聯系，（三）關於行總各部門之工作情形等，除專派監察委員谷鳳翔，杜尖塤，審計王其昌，錢濟民等來滬會同程監察使進行調査外，行政院並派尹仲容，薛銓曾，夏屏方三人米滬，與谷杜諸氏會商進行會査辦法。谷氏等七人在行總辦事處設有臨時辦公室，每晨九時即到行總，分別調査各應處，並召集主管人員詢談，迄今已十有二日，昨日谷氏等並已開始進行調查行總在虹口區之各儲藏倉庫，昨晨至午竟日視察，今明日將仍繼續視察倉庫，並擬錄報告送交監察院。行總方面對於監察院此項澈查工作不願有何表示，並稱調查所得，將由監察使署方面發表云。</p>
<p>又據程監察使語記者：關於行總之澈查，除財務　外，其他各部門之調査工作，於一週內可完畢。惟財務應以賬册頗多，審核需時，故於短時期內尙難以完成。至行總澈査後之結果，將彙報監察院，使署方面不擬有所發表云云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕自聯總宣佈對華停運以來，各方對此極爲矚目，記者昨特訪行總發言人，就恢復運輸問題，提出訪問，據稱：「關於聯總何時恢復對華運輸，此間尙未接獲聯總方面之通知」，現積存於上海倉庫中之物資，均爲重型機器，本署已令儲運人員及機器裝配廠晝夜工作二十四小時，以期早日淸除倉儲積貨。該項重型機器大部係聯總購自南太平洋之剩餘舊軍用機器，必須費工裝配方能運入內地，有時發現機器缺少主要零件，尙須加以裝配。由上海碼頭搬運機器至眞茹暨南大學本署機器裝配廠，即爲一項繁難工作，例如大型開山機，本身不能行走，須設法拖曳入廠。</p>
<p>改善運輸·訂新辦法</p>
<p>記者詢以過去運輸之情形，該發言人謂：「本署一向在極困難之技術條件下，辦理運輸工作，過去聯總貨輪來華，並不事先以船期及貨名通知本署，以致無從事先準備，現本署已要求聯總署長拉加第亞氐改善其辦事程序，現雙方已議訂新辦法：（一）聯總同意事先以船貨文件及貨物淸單通知本署駐華府辦事處，（二）所有聯總運華物資須根據中國政府與聯總所訂之基本協定，全部移交於行總，雙方於船邊交貨，不得躭延。（三）聯總運華之罐頭食品，交通器材及機件，應於裝運出口時，事先檢驗，並由聯總向本署保證各項物品均屬良好，以免物資到華後，因不能應用而致堆存庫中，難於處理。上述改善辦法，如經切實施行，嗣後本署處理聯總物資，困難當可望减少。此外爲避免物資完全集中上海起見，聯總已同意考慮使用較小之海輪運貨來華，俾能在內海內河較小港埠靠岸卸貨，以便轉運至內地。</p>

<h3>難民難童收容所昨舉行檢閱典禮　秩序良好精神飽滿市長致詞備加讚許</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕火傘似的烈日下，來往於上海與漕河涇的汽車絡續不絕。市長吳國楨，社會局長吳開先，副局長李劍華，衛生局長張維，市黨部主任委員吳紹澍，慈善家董和甫朱學範及「聯總」的蒲瑞德等，都紛紛趕往上海市社會局難民難童收容所，參加他們盛大的檢閱典禮。</p>
<p>昔日流落街頭的流氓，毳手，乞丐，街童，流浪兒等，而今穿上了一律的制服，整齊地排列在廣場上，等到吳市長等登上了檢閱台，先由美軍部送來的六個女難童獻花後，隊伍便開始檢閱，自始至終，秩序良好，步伐整齊。這檢閱，我已經看到二次了，但是，一次我都曾帶着眼淚的！看到他們，不免有些酸辛的感覺，爲什麽他們生而無父母？於是漂泊！流浪！</p>
<p>吳市長說：今天是我到上海以後最快樂的一天，我曾爲上海社會道德的淪落而悲哀，但是這悲哀，在到了這裏後。已經不再存在了。各位從流落街頭一躍而成爲最有用的人，是首先要向你們道喜的。第二，我要向中華民國道喜。過去，你們都是沒有國家觀念的，然而今天，你們都成了最愛護國家的人了。你們旣然來到了這兒，政府是一定要支持你們，培植你們的，還望你們在周所長領導之下，永遠前進！</p>
<p>回答吳市長的，是雷動的掌聲，和嘹亮的口號：中華民國萬歲，蔣主席萬歲。</p>
<p>前奏曲，奏樂，獻花，升旗禮，檢閱，入營宣誓，給獎，歡呼，疊羅漢，團體操……炎日之下，層出不窮的精彩節目，讓每個來賓都呆住了。大家都在懐疑：這就是往昔的罪犯？那些受人深惡痛絕的蠢虫？</p>
<p>正像所長周祖望所說的：十個月以前，把這羣人放到社會中去，不知道要用多少警察來彈壓他們，但是現在他們都已學會了自治，辨明是非黑白，成爲社會的生產階段了·</p>
<p>他們在所中是怎麽樣生活的？—分工合作，互助助人，工讀同施，敎養並重。關於所中一切的組織，記者在本月二日的報紙上，已有過詳盡的介紹，自然沒有重複的必要。總之，這兒是他們的家，在所中他們找到了嚴父和親朋，同情和溫暖！團結的生活，呌他們忘掉了自己，「羣」的觀念中，他們永遠不再孤獨了·</p>
<p>昨天，中央電影製片廠已將他們的活動　成電影，希望它的公映，能夠喚起人們的同情，而予以精神上和物質上的援助，因爲所中的經費非常困難，必須社會人士加以扶助，使這有意義的工作，能夠　　　來，而要做到社會上沒　　　流浪的廢物，國父所謂的「　不　遺，夜不閉戶」的大同世界的起點，也就是在乎此了。</p>

<h3>國內郵資增四倍　郵政總局正呈請中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據郵政總局郵務、帮辦王裕光昨日宜稱：郵局現已呈請立法院將國內郵資增加四倍，以彌補每月四十億元之巨額虧損。據稱：郵資增加四倍之建議，尙係二月前事，而今物價上漲，又已近九倍。國府上月僅能彌補郵資虧損之一部份，致該局不得不吿貸於郵政儲匯局以求其收支之平衡。郵政總局向該局借款總數，積至目前止，已近二百億元之鉅，據王副局長之解釋，每月郵政巨額虧損之原因，在於物價之急遽上漲。今日郵資僅及一九三六年數之四百倍，而同一期間之物價已漲達五千至一萬倍。王氏末並指出，郵局當然不能每月賴政府津貼以維持也。</p>
<h3>身穿老棉襖參觀冷藏室　零下廿五度如入北極圈</h3>
<p>在都市的夏令生活裏，冰是不可缺少的必需品，據估計：在最熱的天氣裏，全上海一天內機器冰的需要量約達六百噸，平常也在四百噸左右。現在機器冰的出廠價目是六萬元一噸，算起來上海人每天冰的化費就達二三千萬元。</p>
<p>製冰廠的主要業務還在於冷藏，目前上海的冷藏公司華商有七家，洋商有五家，另外還有幾家接收下來的敵產。記者最近到華商中規模最大已有二十多年歷史的茂昌冷藏公司裏去參觀了一次。</p>
<p>製機器冰是在一個儲有鹽水的長方形的池裏，隔成十多個長槽，裝置十來根通阿母尼亞的管子。把沙濾水放在特置的長方形鐵箱裏，然後一箱一箱放進槽裏，上面用木板蓋沒。阿母尼亞把熱氣都吸收去了，鹽水也盡了一部份輔助的作用，經過三十六小時以後，鐵箱裏的沙濾水就凍凝成一塊塊潔白的冰了</p>
<p>五層樓上是阿母尼亞的冷却器，自來水滴瀝滴瀝的灑在七曲八繞的鐵管上。阿母尼亞從機器裏壓出來，通過冷藏間及製冰間，吸收來的熱度到這裏來加以冷却。這樣往返循環，如果沒有漏氣等損失，簡直可以用之不盡。</p>
<p>走進第一間冷藏室，披上一件厚厚的老棉襖兩只脚還是覺得凍入肌膚。這還不算最冷的，溫度在華氏三十二至三十六度間，外國人所謂ChillRoom，裏面藏的是海味北貨水菓西藥等，天花板上阿母尼亞的管子不過十二根·</p>
<p>故奶粉冰洪淋等的Freeze　Room可眞冷得使人以爲到了北極，雖然異香撲鼻，溫度却在華氏零度左右，天花板上的管子有廿四根。再到放黃魚烏賊魚的一間裏可愈來愈厲書了，阿母尼亞管子足足有百來根。一方面冷得頗有吃不消之勢，一方面那股鹹腥味也着實不好受，所以略一瀏覽，就退了出來。</p>
<p>但是最冷的還有一間速凍間，溫度是華氏零下廿五度。時鮮貨大都先要在這間裏冰凍後再行安藏。</p>
<p>出門的時候看到一家飯店送來兩籃的童子雞寄藏。這吿訴你一個秘密，爲什麽一年四季裏任何時候你都能吃到時鮮貨，上海的餐館與冷藏公司眞可以說是相依爲命，分不開的「寃家」！（凡士）</p>

<h3>胡副局長談營業牌照稅</h3>

<h3>敵偽時期　謀殺親夫案　犯婦詹周氏高院昨提訊　說來話長往事不堪回首</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敵僞時期轟動上海之謀殺親夫案兇犯詹周氏（見圖）被當時僞法院判處死刑，上訴遭駁回。但未待執行勝利來臨，僞法院之判決宣吿無效，該案遂重再審理。詹周氏現押北浙江路看守所內，昨晨高檢處特派法警往提，待押至提籃橋上海監獄時已十一時半。即由檢察官開偵査庭訊問，至十二時許完畢，改押上海監獄女監內。</p>
<p>爲院審結判處死刑</p>
<p>按詹周氏現年卅一歲，丹陽人，前居本市醫園弄新昌路四三二弄八五號後樓。其夫詹雲影，安徽人，業舊貨。去年三月二十日淸晨，詹周氏乘夫熟睡之際，用切菜刀向其頭部頸部小腿大腿上股下肢等處猛砍，事後復分屍十餘段，裝入皮箱內，企圖滅跡。但爲二房東王燮陽發覺，遂報警將詹周氏逮捕。事後並牽涉賀大麻子小寗波等有戀奸幫兇嫌疑，但經當時僞法院審理後，兩嫌疑犯無罪，而詹周氏終判死刑。</p>
<p>回溯往事良人不良</p>
<p>昨日詹周氏衣舊藍布短袖旗袍，赤足穿灰條搭布鞋·頭髪向後分梳兩辮，手執紅色花格手帕。領扣因天熱而向下翻開，身材短矮。當由看守所押至上海監獄除下手銬後，以「說來話長」開端，與記者談稱：十七歲時訂婚，二十一歲結婚，丈夫在外吃穿嫖賭，無所不爲，不常歸家，與其好言相勸，反時遭打駡，在外又曾與一丫頭私通，因而得孕，皆由我代爲了結。失業時，全賴我一人做工所得，維持生活，很彼不知回頭，棄家庭於不顧，在外嫖賭如故，將傢具變賣殆盡，</p>
<p>描繪砍殺謂如遇鬼</p>
<p>去年三月十九日夜，自外返家，彼此又爭吵一塲，即各睡下。深于夜我忽猛然驚醒，當解手之後，即自馬桶旁之橱內拿出菜刀，向床上猛砍，當時只知像砍普通束西一樣，自己亦不知砍多少刀，事後又像有人在耳邊說，把他斬斷，我乃依之而做。直至被抓進捕房後，方知自己做了什麽事。到現在想來，自己亦不知道當初怎樣會做出這件事。眞像有「赤佬」一樣。</p>
<p>聞知重審連稱謝謝</p>
<p>後又對記者言及在北浙江路看守所時·曾與袁美雲·王國英等押在一起，每天往工塲間做工，似頗滿足。故昨日聞及檢察官諭令改押上海監獄時，要求做做好事，能否重回北浙江路看守所。當由法警吿以上海監獄女監之設備較彼處完善多多，始不再多言。又聽到原判之死刑作廢將重審時，面露笑容，連稱謝謝·</p>
<p>該案現待高檢處偵査完畢起訴後　　可由高院公開審訊·</p>

<h3>松江縣臨參會　請撤回莘莊機構　市府函復未便照辦</h3>
<p>市政府前接松江縣臨參會函，以第二次大會決議，向滬府嚴正交涉，請撤回莘莊各種行政機構。當經函復，查莘莊應歸本市管轄，有民十六年中央批准原　，可以覆按。關於本市與蘇省轄區，前迭接江蘇省政府文電，在未勘劃以前暫維現狀，最近且正由省市雙方代表會議中，所請撤回莘莊各種行政機構，未便照辦云</p>
<h3>征屬優待　照常辦理　未辦積榖地區得籌款代替</h3>
<p>行政院昨令市政府云：查優待出征抗敵軍人家屬，自愛出征壯丁未奉明令退伍以前，仍應繼續辦理。茲為使全國抗　能獲實惠，暨解除各地方政府對於籌集優待榖之困難起見，規定頒發五項如次：（一）所有入伍壯丁，在未退伍以前，其家屬優待，仍應照常辦理。（二）各縣（市）過去原在積榖項下撥充征屬優榖者，關於今後優待榖之發給，仍照舊辦理。（三）各縣（市）已無積榖存儲，可資提撥者，以籌款代替發給之。其籌款數額，按每口赤貧征屬，與每戶自給征屬年給黃榖（麥）二市石之標準，折價辦理。（四）根本未舉辦積榖地區，或有積榖不能撥作他用者，仍以籌款代替發給，其　款數額，准仍照前條之標準折價辦理。（五）籌款辦法，可依據各省往年辦理出征壯丁安家費自行籌集，自行保管，自行發放之精神，由省政府擬訂大綱，今知各縣，再由縣制定實施細則，呈報省府備案，事後並由省府　實核銷。</p>
<h3>戶籍法規　疑義問答（續）</h3>
<p>（三十）問：某鄉有甲民，戶籍原屬乙村，且有配偶，後入贅丙村，又另立戶籍，似此一人同在一管轄區域內，而有兩個住所，在戶籍登記及統計上，均有重複之弊，應如何辦理，其權利義務應屬何處。</p>
<p>答：民法第一〇〇二條，有「贅夫以妻之本籍為本籍」之規定，則甲民有關其屬籍之權利義務，自應以妻之屬籍為根據。然甲民旣有配偶，依民法第九八五條「有配偶者不得重婚」之規定，其入贅根本不發生法律上之效力，因而另立戶籍者，亦於法無據。在統計時，祗能以甲民在乙村之登記事實爲準，以行使其權利義務。</p>
<h3>各區簡訊</h3>
<p>第十二區公所前准該區第三保區民代表邵永生函，以前被選為本區區民代表，嗣復被選為候補市參議員，茲因翁參議員建光逝世出缺，依法由永生遞補，遞遺區民代表缺，亦應由候補當選人王慶孫遞補，請查照辦理。當經該區公所呈奉市府令知，翁建光所遺參議員缺，以邵永生遞補案，已呈內政部核示，應候另令飭遵，至邵永生所遺區民代表缺，准由王慶孫遞補云。</p>

<h3>秋銷並無多大希望　元色布銷路復振　老牌字號做不過新興號子</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來天氣炎熱，已告落令之夏季生意，又復起色，布市客銷元布藍布，各幫尚有動辦，遠地如迪化重慶汕頭，亦有單子打出，為數雖屬零星，而空古足音，業中人已樂道之，經銷此種貨色者，一為廠家，一為號家，廠家自某大染織廠一度出事，客家之先銀後貨者，曾有幾家事先出貨，旋各廠交貨並無留難，外埠船期又多延遲，客幫人心即復安定，且　來廠家自設門市及向近省各埠設置莊口者，日益增多，中型廠家因客銷困難，尤以此為自　生路之法，故廠家對於客幫，已减低其牽就之心理，該業重鎮達　染織廠，近亦恢復其門市部矣，號家之做客幫批發者，以鄭家木橋一帶各號為中心，自公大號倒閉涉訟，人心曾一度恐惶，幸近日元布銷路復起，憑添無限春色，藍布如大陸藍·九如藍等，入夏後落寞已久，近亦動銷，坯子來根尚鬆，常州坯布採辦尤易，雙玉圖元布，各幫已起運多起，惟農邨經濟困難，購買力低微，所去之貨，甚少大批也，陰丹士林布雖有染料行將斷擋之刺激，但銷路仍無起色，當係高身骨貨價不合農邨購買力所致，據布業權威者談稱，外有紡建分設推銷處，本市又有中央信託局零星拋售，同業批發生意，本極難做，當此青黃不接之秋，有此小小動辦，已屬難能可貴，一般人所屬望之秋銷，據云並無多大希望，並稱棉布字號為敵偽強迫收買一空，除鄭家木橋一帶新興字號外，力能經營生意者，能有幾家，好在客幫並無大銷路，有之亦難應付云，據消息靈通方面表示大門售店家向之兼營批發者，今亦不敢動手，其原因出於照正軌手續，所獲不夠報解營業稅，顧情甘放棄云，並稱目下所流通之常州坯布，來自單幫，買賣手續，至為簡單，捐稅甚輕，加以種種新興字號開支較省，且往往店主自跑外場，銷貨俑金都免，如此經濟，才可薄利多銷，自非正式老牌號子可敵云，據棉布公會消息，該會所設市場，因業務清淡，且對於無正式號子之同業，亟待援助，已經理事會決議，添發市場證二百張，可見布業底子之薄矣。</p>
<h3>華股已止跌轉漲　法奸股票過戶糾紛　業中聞已商得解决</h3>
<p>華股大戶納胃略殷，初平譏俏，臨收又入盤檔，現永紗價低於期貨少許，不乏投機活動，美亞有補空及新買參加，形勢較為生色，三小熱新光業已超越景福以上。冷門各股元老股仍難推動，大勢尚不脫盤局，結果與前收相較計永紗回升二十元，美亞回漲一成弱，景福好八元，新光漲十元，勤興亦升八元，較冷各中小型微有進展，元老股並無回振之力，不見佳妙。</p>
<p>外股稍稍見活，法商附逆股票交割後，過戶發生糾紛事，聞已由業中人與原主商獲解決，買氣稍活，怡紗自八一〇〇元升至八四〇〇元，其他各股稍有參差，良以時間關係，未能普遍也，結果較前收計怡紗會德　鋼業怡　英聯各升半成左右，餘者仍梢見挫。</p>
<h3>公債無生氣</h3>
<p>公債除戊種外，均乏生氣，統丙晟開六八〇元，中途見低至六六〇元，最後因統戊有七樓兩大戶略收，自六〇〇元見升至六五〇元左右之助力，稍有回升至六八〇元左右結束，與前收相較，計甲乙平平，丙種小十元，丁種好三十元，統戊還本期最遠，有人活動，獨漲五十元。</p>
<h3>金鈔見穩</h3>
<p>焓赤昨續進展，惟蠢動時間至暫，迨買意見止後，浮多紛有脫手，近午後於不支，晨開時尚告平定，開後人心仍俏，經錢兌業及一般空方追補後，高價盤好至一九四萬五，此際因登記配給關係，　戶暫告觀聖，漲後漸回，十時後中央銀行配給五十條，價一九三萬五，此後漸起反動，午刻退至一九二萬五左右，午後微告軟化，結果與前收相仿佛，飾金念萬〇六，紋銀平而銀元升，暗拆息價仍自九分至一角二，惟現鈔頭寸有低至七分者。</p>
<p>外匯除現鈔隨金市趨好外，電匯仍無起色，美匯無變動，英匯八千七至八千八，印匯六六〇元，港匯五五〇元，均有賣戶，美鈔最開二五四〇元買價起，盤漲至二五七〇元以上，始起回風，午刻已退至二五四〇元內外掙扎，午後稍有下游，結果較前收徵降五元，港票初俏後穩，高價曾升至五六五元以上，結果較前收升三元。</p>
<h3>腸衣　成本一百五十萬　售價一百四十萬</h3>
<p>本市出口腸衣，因駛往紐約及歐洲輪隻稀少，仍難大量裝出，目前滬地價格，由鮮腸製成光腸之每桶成本，為一百四五十萬元。以國外市價計算，毫無利潤可言，現該業，僅能維持工人生活而已，又據業中人云：近日某報刊載之腸衣價格其鮮腸為一百八十萬元恐怕有訛誤蓋普通鮮腸每斤市價，係相等於鮮肉價四分之一，合每桶價一百廿五萬元，再加列加工費用廿五萬元，則其成本為一百五十萬元按最近美國買價每副值美金五角五分，每桶尚不及一四〇萬元，若鮮腸高達一百八十萬元，則國內製成品，已須二百餘萬。</p>
<h3>米市來源絡繹·粳秈繼續下降</h3>
<p>昨日米市南北兩市場共到七千餘石，市化依然呆木，新鮮略有交易，中次及宿貨苦無問津形勢仍難起色，粳秈高貨續疲一餘元，惟百元到貨見稀，暫持平局，浦東新粳粥食去胃略有，網連日狂跌之後，形趨堅定之狀。麵粉因錫地來貨仍續，兵船步降一二百元，小麥散戶依然揀高略取，市勢軟化，價平二三百元，甬幫雖動取而不旺，仍然供過於求之勢，後形亦雖有好面，北洋幫完全揀取白麥，故成交亦頗稀少。黃豆新貨來源漸湧，去胃不暢，續小一二千元一二千元，陳貨因油廠納胃不佳，亦削千元之　，　豆挫千元，芝蔴跌一二千元，生仁消化平平，續小千餘元。油市鑒於天氣炎熱，素油另化較增，店胃轉活，背島來源到而不旺，生油回升千元，豆油申廠供應接連，常錫到貨亦有，價形仿佛，豆餅鄉消頗活，惟秋今將屆，肥田應用亦隨落令，價升二三百元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市向　越訂購之洋米絡繹運抵埠者，計二十五萬包，共二萬五千噸，尚有大批越米，在運滬途中，該項洋米，市府決定先行平價出售，凡本市各機關及公教人員公司工廠員工，皆可備文申請配購，詳細辦法，正由社會局糧食科徵訂中，聞數量價格方面，原則已決定承認每月兩斗，兒童减半。招商局其美輪昨午抵滬，由蕪湖運來白米五千九百五十餘包，現泊南黃浦十·十一號浮筒起卸。</p>
<h3>航運業亦呈萎縮　主要原因在吃本太重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日的上海航運業，由於工商業的不振，與各地購買力的薄弱，在日益萎縮中。無論長江各口岸的輪運業，或是行駛內河的輪船業，都已大不如前。若無政府的扶助，恐將步一般工商業的後塵。</p>
<p>上海向來是否國最主要的吞吐港，內地的土產原料由各路向這裏集中，轉運各埠或出口。由國外來的洋貨及在這裏向內地運銷，其間盡着聯繫作用的主要交通工具，除鐵路外，便有下述數種：（一）航行長江各口岸間的航輪，（二）航行蘇州河運河等的所謂內河輪船，（三）民船，（四）機帆船。</p>
<p>戰時損失重　有船仍無貨</p>
<p>據有資格的航業界人士說：戰前行駛長江口岸及沿海岸的輪船約有五十萬艘，其航綫有南京，滇　，青島，天津，溫州，甯波能埠，經過戰火的摧殘，有的沉失江中，有的　　上游宜昌重慶等地，杳無訊息。損失總額約在三十萬噸以上。今日劫後殘剩的不過廿萬噸，船隻大小自三四　　　四百噸不等。據稱，　前　位　已銳减，仍呈「有船無貨」現象。每次所開出船隻俱未能裝滿。而自漢下駛輪隻甚至有空回者，故目前營業多賴裝載軍需品與救濟物資聊以支持。商貨與軍運公運的比例約為一·五與三·五之比。然而因軍運公運水脚僅及貨運的六折，再加煤價昂貴，幾至無法維持。</p>
<p>申錫綫較忙　他綫皆寥落，次論內河航輪。戰前主要航綫有無錫，常熟，平湖，湖州，杭州，蘇州，閔行，青浦朱家嘴等綫。其中申錫綫最繁忙，擁有輪船三十餘艘，其他航綫亦有三四隻不等，總計不下五十艘。戰事以後，亦遭重大損失。除招商局自日人遺下之內河輪船公司中接收所得卅二艘外，商業資本各公司若協興，老公茂等之能自備一二隻小火輪者，已不多觀。現已恢復航行的路綫計有申蘇錫綫，湖州綫，平湖綫，常熟綫，杭州綫。由各地運滬的貨物大多為米麥雜糧，由滬運出者為柴油棉花及洋雜貨等。</p>
<p>工資太高了　行程又太緩</p>
<p>據業中人談：內河航輪最大的阻碍，是自前天天在增漲中的船伕工資。同時由於拖船缺乏，租費昂貴，勉強維持已屬不易。况各輪船公司俱有固定班次，一旦貨少，航行費用仍無法减免，此為虧折主因。再以一艘六十噸之拖船（即木駁）計，去年秋間之租費加上船工等費用約為廿五萬一月。今日已漲達二百卅五萬一月。運費水脚三四月來雖有三四成之增加，然已感得不償失。</p>
<p>內河輪船之另一困難為邇來水路治安不寗。盡行夜宿，因此原來僅需二日一夜之航程，今已延長至四日以上。同時因煤價高昂，各公司多雇用柴油輪船。因其機器朽舊遲鈍，延長航行時間亦足以間接加增費用。</p>
<p>敵不過民船　機帆船沒落</p>
<p>內河輪船之競爭現亦增加，即民船是，輪運水脚現如下，柴油四千元一桶，棉花每包（四百斤）約七千，食米每石二千，小麥則依此九折，此項價格原較鐵路運輸約低四成，而民船水脚又便宜四成，所　在途時日幾相等謂原因在於民船開支較省，最近復有自江北避難來滬之民船（所板　子）約近二百餘隻之多，每隻可載重五六十噸，此種船隻競爭之下，即益呈「船多貨少」之現象。</p>
<p>至於剛接收之初，因缺乏輪隻，而曾一度稱霸海上之機器帆船，目前雖仍有近百艘，　現因無法與巨輪競爭，已漸趨沒落。</p>
<h3>紗市成交甚少·現棉售價續升</h3>
<p>昨日紗市初開洋花賴漲，雙馬曾一度升到一百卅五萬，粵幫袖手觀望，同行有意吐售，故價復回小至一百卅二萬五千元，收市中小型紗價雖喊高一二萬，惜去化極滯，成交絕少，人心已不似前日之榮欣。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊頻昂四十七至六十四磅　，計近期美金三四·四五，新花遠期三一·七三，米特林現貨三五·二五，本埠現棉市况仍挺，交易亦不寂寞，申新第二五兩廠各採辦白洛去花三四百包，價續升一二千元。</p>
<p>坯布各方略有需要，根子較緊，其他疋頭，銷場仍寂寞，結果漲二百五十元至五百元，午時紡　照例開售各布，市　仍未變動，與上期相同，午後市况　挫。</p>
<h3>人造絲又提升　廠經綢貨均疲滯</h3>

<h3>紐約之中日絲市　日絲擬跌至三元半　品質超過八十三分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前報載合衆社紐約二日電，略稱：美絲業商人，對中日生絲，已開始競爭。並稱：在公開市場上，我國生絲，每磅僅售美金八元五角。而日本生絲，最高價竟達美金一六元五角。記者頃以此訊詢諸中國蠶絲公司某負責人，據告：此訊對價格之報道或未盡確實。緣以我國目前生絲之成本計，所產七十八分生絲，如在美國市場以每磅八元五角之價格出售，已感無法支持。據告至少需以每磅十元之價格，始能顧到生產成本。至日本生絲每磅一六元五角之價格，據臆測或係六元五角之誤。最近日本方積極增加生絲產量，同時研究提高品質，目的擬使日絲在美國市場减跌至每磅三元半。現日本出口生絲品質標準，多在八十三分以上。而我國則多在八十三分以下。故予我國生絲在美國市場之威脅至鉅。然我國生絲亦非從此即陷入絕境。要胥視我國產絲事業界，如何研求全面合作方案，以求抑低生產成本，提高品質，再配合我國生絲事業天時地利之優惠條件，仍望能在國際市場，與他國生絲爭一日之短長也。</p>

<h3>大戈壁的跋涉　南疆風情　八月二日迪化航訊</h3>
<p>— 李尚智</p>
<p>記者在甘肅酒泉接到迪化南疆公路新段工程處的電令，為着要使南疆公路全綫趕工，命速組測量隊，由敦煌西出陽關大道，至甘新交界之芨芨合，向西進測。去年十月間，在酒泉匆忙里籌備了一個星期，率領着測量隊全體人員，及一切必要的給養，配備，向敦煌進發。</p>
<h3>敦煌印象</h3>
<p>我想，初到敦煌的人，也許都會有一種單調和不調諧的感覺；不到一公里方的城池，居然會有幾十所廟宇，就是普通住宅和商店，也是近乎廟堂式的。全城的交通道都是土路，唯有東西橫貫的幹路，是用石灰三合土鋪成，而且年久失修，已經呈着高低不平的樣子了。城里最大的交易是在這兒開展着，這也就是全城精華的所在；究其實，一切商店在形式上是異常可憐的，也可以說，敦煌的商業是有市無面的。</p>
<p>據說去年初秋，南疆公路甘段工程處（修築敦煌至芨芨合段）到這兒來時，當地曾起了一場大的波動，這真是千載難逢的機會，於是物價——尤其是食糧——隨着商人們貪婪的綫索提升起來，結果，當然是發了一筆「建國財」這次他們聽說我們來了，跟着他們貪無止境的慾望，物價又再度飛漲，可惜我們一切給養配備都是在酒泉準備好的，這簡直好像在他們灼熱的胸膛上澆了幾桶冷水似地，使他們大失所望。記得有一次在筵會席上，當地的商會會長曾對我說：我們把物價都「調整」過了，以為滿可以賺到一筆錢的，誰知你們什麽都不買！這時，我心里雖充溢憤慨，但為着環境關係，不便給他們嚴厲的指責，只報以淡淡的一笑。</p>
<h3>駝運大隊</h3>
<p>由敦煌西出陽關大道，指向甘新的交界，已接近大戈壁的邊緣了；在這地帶里，活動着的唯一的運輸工具，就是駱駝，因為公路剛開始建築，給水，油料，都成問題，所以汽車是無法利用的。又因為水草的集中點相距得很遠，馬匹和騾子，在這方面也是無法利用。在華任顧問的某美籍公路專家曾說：就是以美國現在的裝配，也不敢試嚐修築這條荒僻的伸展在大戈壁中的公路。而我們，為着鞏固邊疆的國防，遂決定採用這原始的運輸工具，來修築這條近代的交通綫。要知道；在戈壁灘上修築公路，工程比較簡易，最主要的還是在運輸。</p>
<p>南疆公路甘段開工較早，我們到敦煌時，他們已將完工。他們所雇用的駱駝也逐漸解雇，放回敦煌來。那時，一般駝戶都是由張某所控制，甘段的駝運工作也就是由他承攬的，當然，他是居中賺到了一筆錢。我們為着適應趕工計劃和爭取時機，事實上，不能與個別的駝戶訂約辦理運輸，不得已，遂與張某商談，誰知，他最初以新境地理環境惡劣，荒無水草，駱駝不能行駛為辭，後雖勉強應允帮忙，但大施高抬價格，從中牟利之絕技，我們雖再三容忍，唯限於單價過高而陷於僵持狀態。在這里，使筆者聯想到不少感想，我們與張某的交涉，簡直不像通常雇主與包商的談判，我們不像政府的工作人員，我們簡直成了向人借貸的人了。不知費了多少口舌向他解說，發展邊疆交通，藉此提高邊民文化水準和鞏固國防的重要，而他，除了知道從棺材里伸出一隻手來死要錢之外，毫不把國家的利益放在心里。我們謙虛，容忍，婉言解說，只是白費勁兒。人的良心如果黑，結果一定失敗的，張某一面企圖抬高單價，一面又向駝戶壓低單價，這怎能不逼使駝戶們離散呢？而駝戶們是拿駝運工作當着終身職業的，又怎肯放棄這一大宗生意呢？他們遂自動聯合起來，公推代表來跟我們接洽，真正的勞動者是可愛的，他們只希望滿足自己生活的需要，而不貪圖過份的利潤，他們毅然接受我們的條件，願意深入新境的大戈壁中担任運輸，且接受我們所提出的公允的單價，在合法的利潤下，他們沒有被人剝削而感到欣快。</p>
<p>經過近兩星期的鬥爭，駝運大隊是組織起來了，在十一月廿五日的中午，隻隻雄壯的駱駝，馱着測量隊的工作人員，馱着蓬帳，儀器，食品，用具，行李等一切配備，邁着徐緩的步伐，兩公里長的隊伍漸次駛出敦煌的西門，駝鈴的丁冬聲迴旋在遼闊的大戈壁上。</p>
<h3>西出敦煌看海洋</h3>
<p>離開敦煌約摸有十五公里，已不可能再看見零落的田園了，所展現在眼前的只是遼闊，灰暗，在灰暗的邊緣，接起冷靜的蒼天。駱駝邁着遲緩的步伐，真所謂「一步三搖幌」駝背上的人，遠眺那上下移動着的地平綫，像海濤，像海洋里的天際，不禁引起無盡端的鄉思。我們大半都來自海邊，也有航海的經歷，那情景怎不使人懷戀啊！我突破了沉寂，向背後的伙伴說：</p>
<p>『張醫生，你看，那是海洋，多美麗啊！』</p>
<p>『是啊！咱們是在趁着「沙舟」航海啊！』他感慨地說。</p>
<h3>大路黑風</h3>
<p>「路是被踐踏出來的」，一點也不錯，在大戈壁上所謂大路，不知是幾世紀前的隊商所遺留下的足跡，以後的過客，也踏着這步伐的烙印，走向各人的目的地，經過幾千年的踐踏，在暗灰的戈壁灘上，拉出一條不到半公尺寬的，曲折的，淡灰色的帶子來，陌生人，如果循着這條帶子——大路——前進，總會把你引到一處有水草的地方（也許這不是你的目的地）假如你脫離了它，就會迷失方向，甚至乾渴死在戈壁上，最初，我們都很看不起這原始的大路，後來在測量的進程中，我們才知道，雖然我們帶了很多很精確的儀器，可是大路給我們的帮助，也是不可抹殺的。</p>
<p>在北國住過的人們，也許都聽過關於「黃風」的掌故，那是在蒙古高原上，黃沙地帶中，狂飚掀着黃沙紛飛，據說是可以把隊商都埋藏起來的。而在大戈壁上，就有所謂「黑風」，一旦風起，咫尺之內不見人，對面不聞聲，整個空間頓成黑暗，細石子從四面八方擊來，有時牲畜也被颶風捲去，帶到不知名的地方，假如沒有這種經驗的人，一旦遇到這種場合，就要驚慌失措，恐怖不堪。</p>
<p>我們在一天傍晚，正進行間，忽起颶風，寒風刺骨，空間頓趨昏暗，我趕快止住駝隊，跳了下來，誰知風勢吹人欲倒，我索性躺在地上，命駱駝隊長（他慣於這種生活的）把所有的同伴都拖到我這兒來，集中一起，一面吩咐駝夫用駱駝替我們築起擋風墻來，大家用皮大衣把頭一　，就睡在地上。</p>
<p>戈壁灘上的夜冷清異常，尤其是露宿更為可怕，直到午夜風勢漸息，我伸出頭來仰觀天際，模糊的上弦月時隱時現，凄清蕭寂，「啊，這也是人生的片斷！」</p>
<p>那一夜，我和其他同伴一樣，都不能入睡，直到東方稍現魚白，大家都跳起來，活動一下那凍得麻痺了的身子，而駝戶他們倒熟睡在駱駝的肚底下。大家對昨夜的遭際都有些抱怨與恐懼，我深知在這種場合里，我不能說什麽，唯有催醒駝夫，繼續向前進發。</p>
<p>後來檢點一下，失蹤了兩頭駱駝，八隻水桶和一部份給養。</p>
<h3>荒漠據點</h3>
<p>在大戈壁上跋涉了幾天，每天都是早起用膳，然後浩浩蕩蕩進發，行約三十公里，已將近黃昏，停下來架蒙古包，造飯，飯後就寢。每天的生活都是如此單調，機械，空氣顯得沉悶異常。</p>
<p>戈壁灘上的行程，每三十公里，當地住民稱為一站，這是駱駝每日最大的行程。每次出發，一定要先明瞭前面最近水源地與出發點相距的站數，途中有無柴燒，你必須帶上足夠的食水和柴草（假如路上沒有柴的話）否則巧婦是難做無柴水之炊的。</p>
<p>由敦煌至甘新交界的芨芨台，這一段的戈壁上，密佈着梭梭，麻黃等下等植物，這些植物不像「下江」的植物一樣，枝幹內充滿了水分，非經多日曝晒烘乾，不能做燃料，而戈壁灘上因滴雨不下，植物非常乾燥，取來即可燒飯，而且打柴是用不着任何工具的，只要用脚在跟上一踢，俯拾即得，這些特點是沒有去過戈壁灘的人所意想不到的。敦煌至芨芨台的三百三十三公里公路綫上，僅有多巴溝，安南壩和拉配泉三處可得到給水，而拉配泉的水源又含鹽質頗重，不適於飲用，但不得已時，只得以冰代替，因為冰的含鹽成份會比水少些。</p>
<p>這些水草聚集的地方，我們通常稱它為「據點」，假如失去這些據點，我們是無法生存的。</p>
<h3>哈薩民族</h3>
<p>哈薩人是新疆十四種民族之一，和蘇聯的哈薩克共和國的人民同種，信奉回教，語言可與維吾兒族相通，善騎射，短小精悍，貪小利，文化水準非常低落，到現在，還保持部族生活，在南疆一帶，一共有六個部族，那就是：</p>
<p>阿都巴義——聚居於鹽池灣</p>
<p>沙拉亥丁——聚居於長草溝</p>
<p>胡思曼——聚居於安南壩</p>
<p>加南伯里——聚居於鹽池灣</p>
<p>哈不的里——聚居於海子</p>
<p>胡賽因——聚居於萊斯</p>
<p>他們所聚居的地方，當然都是所謂「荒漠上的據點」，日常的生活是遊牧，打獵。生活習慣非常簡單，每一部族包括的戶數不等，完全視酋長強弱而異。每戶人家都住在蒙古包中，一頂蒙古包可住二人至四人，蒙古包的構成是由矮木柵圍成圓形，外圍以羊毛氈，留一方形孔，掛以氈簾做為門，上以枝條架錐形屋頂，仍以氈敷蓋，錐頂留圓形小天窗，可以啟蔽自如。地上多舖以氈，夜間席地而眠，即以日間所穿皮大衣做被蓋，每日食品以羊，駝，野味為主，麵食為副，通常每人俱備尖刀一把，進餐時，以刀削肉一片，置火上烘熟，即行進食，麵粉則做成「小　　」形如鵝蛋，每人一枚，食後飲少許羊奶或國產香茗。生活習慣當然不會講求衛生的。</p>
<p>南疆這六個部族中，最強的要算胡賽因，其次是胡思曼，去冬，胡賽因並以其女嫁胡思曼之次子，他們是不與外族通婚的。記得民國卅一年曾有蘇聯工程師來南疆勘察南疆公路（即我們測量的地帶）結果，全數人員都被胡賽因槍殺，並刧去所有財物，至今他們所帶的測量儀器等還存留在胡賽因的部族裏。</p>
<p>這次出發，大家都取相當戒心，因為我們必需先要通過其他四個部族聚居的附近，然後到安南壩胡思曼的範圍裏，測量的工作地又是在胡賽因的圈子裏，在這些哈薩人聚居地裏通過和工作，內心相當不安，而且因為運輸的困難，是無法多帶武裝警衛隊的，好在後來政府派駐邊疆的人員與他們談妥，每月發給他們一些獎金，他們才允協助築路（所謂協助者，只好做不擾亂來解釋）我們測量隊並雇用哈薩及維吾兒翻譯各一人，嚮導二人，以備轉譯交涉，這才使大家心稍安一點。</p>
<p>我們沿大路前進，至安南壩，因為用水告警，只得派駐入壩馱水濟急，　並派了一位同伴和哈薩翻譯，帶了一些茶磚白藥等一同入壩見胡思曼，以示聯絡，他非常欣喜，并熱烈招待了我的代表，第二天，派了兩頭快駝，由他的大兒子送我的代表出來，並帶來了兩隻羊來見我。據說，他的母親（胡思曼之妻）病得很厲害，希望我們送些藥品給他，並說待他母親病好了，他父親一定入山打些野味送來給我們，不過希望我們能給他二百斤麵粉，他還說此去芨芨合一路都是他的範圍，請我們安心，必要時他還可以跟着我們做警衛工作，我為着免除一些不必要的麻煩，我當即表示感謝他的好意，並由張醫生檢了一點合用的藥品，給他帶回去。後來直到我們測量完畢回到敦煌，胡思曼才來找我，那時只有施工隊的少數人員在拉配泉，倒把他們嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>我覺得邊民也不是絕對野蠻而無理性的，只因為他們文化水準低落，頭腦簡單，容易反叛，容易為人利用，更因為他們懶惰，貧困，更容易招致叛亂，所以今後政府對於推進邊疆教育將是非常重要的課題，這可以併入邊民政治建設的部門，而與經濟建設在鞏固國防上是有同樣重要意義的。</p>
<h3>冰窩與火</h3>
<p>由安南壩經過三天的行程，趕到拉配泉，據嚮導說：前去無柴無水，我只得分出一大批駱駝來馱冰和柴，這將使測量工作增加不少困難，因為我們人數不算少，每日的用水量雖節制到最低限度（只供飲用，盥洗是被禁止的）也是無法支持這悠長的測量路綫，如今分段接連，運距又這樣長。駝數有限，往返耽擱，亦難免有斷柴斷水之處。為應付這特殊的地理環境和當前的困難，我遂決定採用突擊戰術，每日工作時間盡量拉長，以最大的速率進測。因此我們在拉配泉需要耽擱兩天，打柴搬冰，以做充分準備</p>
<p>拉配泉位在山谷旁的小溝中，氣候異常寒冷，朔風終日呼嘯，即使你穿上五寸長毛皮衣，也會覺得寒風刺骨的，第二天清晨醒來，覺得被頭冰冷僵硬，原來是夜裏呼出的熱氣凝結在那兒，成為厚厚的一層冰，這對於我們可以說是一種奇蹟。睡在我旁邊的張醫生，蒙着頭，蜷曲着身子，還沒醒來，被頭的冰閃爍發着亮光，我推醒他說：</p>
<p>「喂，睡在「冰窩」裏了，還不起來！」</p>
<p>「哈，好冷啊！」他猛地伸出頭來，冰開始在他臉上融化，冒着熱氣。</p>
<p>到拉配泉的第三天，我們進至芨芨台，開始測量。</p>
<p>日出而作，日暮而歸，架賬而居，席地而臥，我們可以說在過着原始人類的生活。</p>
<p>人生是寂寥的，每日晚飯後，大家在蒙古包內圍火休息聊天，這是每日唯一的消遣，唯一的安慰。煤油都凍了，無法點燈，我們只好藉炭水照明，在暗淡的光綫下，吃飯，煮濃茶，談天，現在回想起來倒是別具情趣。</p>
<p>因為要烤火，燒飯，煮茶等等，柴的消費超出了原定的預算，漸漸恐慌起來了，不得已，遂放一批駱駝回拉配泉馱柴，這時我們已離拉配泉有五十餘公里，來回須耽擱五天，加上測量前進的里程，須六天才能趕回來。我們雖盡量節用，但到第五天夜裏，已無柴造飯，大家蒙頭大睡，以熬飢腸。翌日下午，馱隊回來了，兩個廚子忘記了飢餓，呌着跳着，忙着燒飯，直到飯香了，大家才懶洋洋地爬起來飽餐一頓。</p>
<p>這天晚上風很小，大家就在帳外烤火聚談。</p>
<p>天上一片雲彩也沒有，一輪明月　煌，與故鄉的月亮簡直沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>老藍坐在一塊石頭上，嘆了一口氣，張醫生調笑地說：</p>
<p>「老藍，又想起表妹來啦？」大家輕輕地一笑。</p>
<p>「你看月亮多好，偏偏要跑到戈壁灘上來，如果在家裏跟表妹結了婚，吃了夜飯，一起吃吃茶，吸吸烟，看看月亮，多愜意。」老藍慨嘆地說。</p>
<p>「嗯，多愜意，你娃娃可想得安逸。」大家都哄笑起來。</p>
<p>「哎——今天的月亮也分外好」另一個同伴說。</p>
<p>空氣又趨於沉寂，大家都仰視那遊動着的月輪，沉浸在無盡端鄉戀裏。</p>
<h3>重返敦煌</h3>
<p>「水開了，快來喝茶呀！」我故意打斷各人的鄉思，嚷嚷着。</p>
<p>大家若有所思地，喝了些茶，沉默地攢進蒙古包裏去睡了。</p>
<p>我們測量的路綫，翻過了幾個丘陵，爬出了幾條河谷（有河無水）經過紅泉，紅水，梭爾庫里沼澤地，指向金雁山口與來自巴什考貢的西端測量隊快要接綫了</p>
<p>我們奮力進測，已與西端的測量隊相距僅二十餘公里，在望遠鏡裏，可以看到他們的「大旗」和測量人員的活動，於是我派了一個伙伴去請他們的隊長，來商談接綫的問題。</p>
<p>第二天，兩隊相距更近，他們的隊長也來了，大家談妥我們就在山頭上接綫。大家非常興奮，一鼓氣測了下來。</p>
<p>當晚，我們就住在接綫點上，老藍吩咐廚子把晚餐準備得特別豐富。有臘肉，香腸，幹炸風雞，紅燒羊肉，皮蛋，雪菜，飯後喝着濃郁的紅茶。</p>
<p>「你們明天就回敦煌嗎？」西端的測量隊長問我。</p>
<p>「是的•你們呢？」</p>
<p>「我們測完這幾公里也預備回去的。」</p>
<p>工人們很高興地架高了一堆柴，燃起火炬來，並吼叫着。</p>
<p>一件艱苦的工作完成了，大家心裏又高興又輕快。</p>
<p>歸途，我們以最大的速率進行着，待抵紅泉時，遇施工隊，他們已完成了三十幾公里的路綫。</p>
<p>「阿媽媽」（你們好啊——哈薩話）大家互相問候着。</p>
<p>他們並替我們帶來了很多信，真是天涯來鴻逐笑容，大家都非常快樂。我騎在駱駝上，邊走邊看我的一大包信，描聽得背後有人在說話。</p>
<p>「咿——笑了，老藍，是不是表妹來的？」</p>
<p>「不是。」老藍邊笑邊說。</p>
<p>「你不用騙人啦！」</p>
<p>待我們趕抵敦煌，已逼近舊曆年關，家家戶戶門前都貼上大紅的春聯，顯得那么鮮艷引人。</p>

<p>考試方法是否合理</p>
<p>編輯先生：我是一個從內地來的公務人員，為了兒子的入學問題，曾考慮過好多次，從多方面的打聽，才於一月前找到卡德路的國強中學。因為投考初中三的關係，經過相當麻煩的報名手續，在考試完畢的那一天，孩子回來說投考的題目雖則相當難，但是成績祇少有七十分以上的把握，因為他在重慶時常考第一名的。豈知到了發榜的那天去一看，竟然會名落孫山，而考投謀校初三的一百多名中僅取了一名。在理取與不取，我們是毫無異言的，不過該校為什麽只取一人，為了要招一個標準學生而要化費一百多人的精神與時間，這是否是應該做的？第二點，在口試的時候，硬要學生排列在大操場上晒太陽，主試的老師非常仔細的一個個挨次詳詢，連祖宗三代的職業也要問過明白。可憐我的孩子從上午七時起至下午二時才回來吃飯，飯後便病倒了，到現在還沒有起床。不知這樣的口試是否合理？該校雖則以辦理嚴格著稱，這種不合理的處置應該要改善的，因不合理的考試而連累家長和學生們的痛苦和損失，在上海一定很多，所以希望貴報予以改正。（毛志超）</p>
<h3>顧到目前交通情狀</h3>
<p>三輪車人力車應從緩限制</p>
<p>記者先生：上海是國際都市不差，我們要學紐約與倫敦一樣，可是我們的條件太不夠了。就個人來說：私人汽車沒有那么普遍，人家每四人中有一部汽車，我們連千分之一還不到。就公共交通來說吧：上海市區的公共汽車電車，太不普遍了，原有路綫車輛也太少了。人家有立體的交通設備，天空與地下都可以行，我們連平面的交通，還這么可憐！在這種情況之下，怎麼可以學紐約或倫敦呢？過渡時期，代替的就是三輪車與人力車，以我看來，還是相當的需要。我們認為消極的限制，不如積極的開拓。汽車電車如果能夠普遍發達，三輪車與人力車，必定自然歸於淘汰，誰要這種落伍的東西？消極的限制，千分之一（也許還不到）的汽車階級也許便利多多，但是千分之九九九的人民，多少不便呢？還有一層，應得顧慮的，就是影響所及，不僅製車工人大量失業造成社會恐慌，同時一方面黑市車照，也因此發生。總之，限制三輪車與人力車，政策上我亦贊同，不過尚非其時。（毛達人）</p>

<h3>積水屋頂夠受用　避暑何必遠征？</h3>
<p>— 家南</p>
<p>據筆者觀察所得，十個人中倒有九個是不喜歡夏天的。祇要一想起火傘高張，揮汗如雨的情形，內心總不免有一種煩悶的感覺。</p>
<p>當然，富有的人可以在夏天到氣候凉快的地方去避暑，但是一般的人，就辦不到。至於冷氣設備，缺點實在太多：第一，裝置複雜，不適宜於家庭之用；第二，室內外的氣候相差太多，總覺到不大自然；第三，必須把窗門全部緊閉，也似乎不合人情之常。許多人都在想：假如有一種簡單的辦法，可以很自然地把室內的溫度减低一些，而又不違背人類的習慣，那就最合理想了。</p>
<p>這種理想，現在在美國已經實現。建築家卜曼侖斯在不久以前設計了一種房屋，可以使室內的溫度比室外低十至十二度。至於方法，是非常簡單的，其條件就是：（一）房屋必須平頂，周圍裝以邊緣，可以積水半英寸；（二）房頂上，必須另塗一層柏油，保證它不致漏水；（三）裝置若干鉛管活塞，可以自動調節積水的份量，假如水超過了半英寸，就可以自動地把它排除。</p>
<p>據這位建築師說：屋頂上的積水可以把日光中的熱力反射出去，因此房屋內部可以凉爽得多。因爲普通房屋頂上，在日光照耀之下，可能達到一百五十度的高熱。</p>
<p>但是使用道種房屋，有兩點必須特別注意：（一）屋頂上的積水不能讓樹葉之類的雜物積聚在裏面；（二）必須時常使用殺蟲藥，以免成爲蚊蚋和其他昆蟲的繁殖所。</p>
<p>爲了適應需要起見，美國的米德威公司已經在製造一種「積水屋頂」的活動房子，準備人家訂購。在炎熱的夏天聽到這種消息，彷彿服一味淸凉劑。</p>
<p>當然依中國的物質條件言，國人還沒有享受這種好福氣的資格，但是這種發明，對於全世界的人類總是一個好消息，相信在五年十年之後，中國也可能大規模建造這種房屋，使一輩怕熱的人，在漫長的夏天可以有一個喘息的機會，譬如說：像上海地方，夏日的氣候大致在九十度左右，假如住在這種房屋裏，氣溫就不過八十度左右，眞是再理想也沒有了！</p>
<h3>夏季洛陽</h3>
<p>— 范鴻</p>
<p>洛陽的夏天，雖較汴鄭爲凉爽，但還不若附近外縣的清風綠蔭爲舒快，人口是越來越多，車馬是越來越喧，灰塵是越來越大，氣候也越來越惡劣，不下雨的時候是酷熱，下雨時候是悶熱。所以很多的防空洞門都又打開了，大槪家庭的高等人，商店裏的老板，到中午都下洞去享這淸閒凉快之福了。他們在洞裏，可不像以前那樣的驚恐了，他們放大着胆，滿伸着意。在洞裏過着自在的生活，洞裏不用扇子，沒有蚊子蠅子和蝨蚤，洞裏設有躺椅，長沙發，棕絲床，洋燭，小桌，麻將，牙脾，小說，秘書，勤務，參謀，小貓小狗，……還有女人。</p>
<p>那是人間天堂，那可不是人間地獄，雖然它埋藏在幾丈下的深土裏。</p>
<p>但這裹有歡笑，也有悲哀！還有過死人！</p>
<p>夏天怎樣過？販夫走卒地攤車攤商，終天在陽光毒辣的照射下咒駡着：一方布棚，遮擋着太陽，一圓蒲扇，揮趕着熱汗，眼裹不住的盯着過路顧客。口裏宣傳着：要不要，上海貨……他忘却了只顧走路的怕熟人。</p>
<p>汽水應時的擺在街巷交口，一瓶瓶的像忠烈祠的牌位，那些都是本地土貨，很多不貼商標，貼着的都是冒着上海製造家的牌，反正顧客一飲而盡，是好哄的，甜食店也加添了汽水酸梅湯等的凉食，都是些凉嘴不凉心的甜水，冰是根本沒有的，不是不需要，是洛陽進化還不到那個程度。</p>
<p>天熱怕走路，旅館的生意較以前大大的冷淡了，冷淡得茶房們一終天伸腿睡懶覺。說閒話。</p>
<p>瓜類水菓也上市，每斤都在一二百元之間，吃的人很不少。</p>
<p>蠅予滿街滿館滿室都是，嗡嗡輪的到處叫得焦人。這說明洛陽還相當的骯髒，人民撲蠅的習慣，日常衛生的講求，以及政府的宣傳防治，是遠不若省會開封的</p>
<p>當義民站領到DDT的時候，爲了洛市的環境衛生，李主任也曾有過改良的計劃，是用DDT噴洒各公共塲所，聯合各機關推動淸潔運動，以提倡全市大衆衛生，但這個計劃只是一個空想，李主任已經調到許昌站去了。</p>
<h3>上海汽水的供應狀態　屈臣氏·正廣和·益利·中央各廠概況</h3>
<p>— 蒼夫</p>
<p>在夏令生活中，汽水該說是佔着舉足輕重的席地。可是幾年的烽火，喝汽水的人們，可也曾想到，這中間包含着一個怎樣劇烈的變遷！</p>
<p>記者曾走訪了好幾家汽水廠，大的廠家說：他們目前因爲受種種生產條件的束總，對業務方面似更有不能暢所欲爲的苦。小的廠家，一方面感到大廠家物美價廉的威脅，一方面又負担不了各種浩大的開支，奄奄無生氣，有的已打算撳業了。</p>
<p>據說普通汽水的節令，大年常是三月到九月，一般的汽水廠都在這時期趕上一筆買賣，過後就宜吿歇業，於是就產生了汽水業失業工人的問題。最近聽說很鬧過一陣子，可是也有經常生產的，這中間比較出名的華商的有屈臣氏，外商的有正廣和。</p>
<p>屈臣氏汽水公司除了生產本牌的各種檸檬·沙士汽水，和梳打水，維他鮮橘水外，還經理着膾炙人口的「可口可樂。」「可口可樂」的總廠，在美國因爲資力雄厚，規模宏大，設備精良，再加廣吿的煊染，已經樹立了廣泛的世界市塲而上海的特約監製人，就是屈臣氏汽水公司。</p>
<p>據屈臣氏公司當局吿訴記者說：太平洋戰後「可口可樂」在上海絕跡了，勝利後最初的幾月中美軍曾裝到少許「可口可樂」的原料，美軍當局曾派員到該公司調査，各項設備認爲合格，所以仍舊委託監製，然而當時出品僅限供給美軍飲用，最近幾月來，船運逐漸暢通，「可口可樂」的原料也陸續運到，才恢復對一般市民的供應。然而因爲限於空瓶缺少的關係，每天祇能出三千打，由該公司直接裝運到各酒菜館，冷飲店，娛樂塲所等，終感供不應求。據說要是儘量供應的話，日產一萬打，也不會有剩餘的。</p>
<p>至於「可口可樂」的原料據說是有秘密性的，通常是由美國總公司原桶配好裝來，在上海再加以適度的砂糖和砂濾水調配而成，可是在調配的成份和比例上，都要維持和美國總公司有同樣的水準，所以每隔一週或十天總要抽樣一瓶，送到美國總公司化騐品質。</p>
<p>現在「可口可樂」的產量，佔屈臣氏各種汽水總產量百分之六十。同時爲了恢復「可口可樂」戰前在上海的市場起見，每打的出廠價，只不過三千元，可是因爲供需相差懸殊，一瓶「可口可樂」，轉輾到了飲客口裏的時候，價格又何止倍蓰，屈臣氏公司目前正在添裝新的機器，設法增加產量，來解決儘量供應的問題。</p>
<p>外商正廣和汽水公司，親模之大，在我國的汽水事業中，該稱獨步。可是在太平洋戰後，業務是完全停頓了，此番重整旗鼓，因爲環境的變遷似乎已乏當年的盛姿了。所以當記者訪問該公司當局時，他們的態度顯得非常閑散，他們表示不願對外多所宣傳，經記者一再探詢，才知道他們的產品有十兩裝的小瓶檸檬，沙士汽水和鮮橘水，七兩和十四兩裝的梳打水，七兩和十兩裝的乾　水，廿四兩裝的大瓶檸檬汽水等，總共日產六千打左右。此外，尙有五加侖裝的大瓶蒸溜水，目前的銷路除上海一埠外尙廣及杭州南京無鍚等地。</p>
<p>此外像中央汽水公司，每天大小瓶汽水大致可產二千瓶到三千瓶，益利汽水公司，每天也可產千瓶左右，其他十幾家中小型汽水廠，大致平均的日產量，都在千瓶左右，可是在機器設備，消毒裝置，和產品的質量方面講，大小廠家的距離是太遠了。據說有些小廠家，因爲汽水節令的關係，大多抱着投機的姿熊來經營業務，消毒設備不必談，就用的空瓶和瓶蓋，十九都是僱人向外搜集而得，同時因爲火廠貶價傾銷，遂亦不得不從减低品質方面一來减小生產成本，以圖與大廠爭一日的短長，可是競爭的代價，却是全體市民的康健，這代價未免太大，希望衛生當局，應該從嚴抽騐各種汽水飲料的品質，來保障全市市民的康健！</p>
<p>最後，從汽水廠商口裏，聽到了一句極符現實的話。他們異口同聲的向記者說：「八年的抗戰，汽水的享受階級，已自中上階級延轉到一般的勞工階級裹去。今天汽水最大的去路，已不是長衫或是白領階級中人，而是出賣勞力的三輪車夫，人力車夫和各種小工們！他們在長途跋涉，或是淌汗勞作之後，都會毫不吝惜的解囊買一瓶汽水喝喝。可是，月掙十幾萬元的長衫和白領界人物，全夏對汽水一項，又那得幾回嚐呢？……」這些話包含着多少心酸，多少苦悶，可是它卻是鐵一般的事實。從缺乏生氣的汽水業中，透視各階層人物生活的遞嬗，記者又不禁爲之擲筆三嘆！</p>

<p>蘆荒都挺直了腰，易於離散的浮萍，也緊集在一起，等待着命運的安排。魚躲到水底，連氣也不敢透。水面像失了光彩的鏡面，假如不是成羣的蜻蜓，在半空飛翔，眞叫人疑心這個世界已死去了。</p>
<p>蜻蜓，袖們活躍着，活躍在大風雨未來臨的時間裏。</p>
<p>是預感到大風雨的侵襲，想找一個安身的處所呢？抑是歡喜的凖備迎受這大風雨的洗禮呢？</p>
<p>飛得很迅速，在空中盤旋，盤旋……復眼的轉動，象徵着那多變的情緒，是驚怖？是欣喜？也許只有牠們知道，一會，又互相追逐着，用尾在水面亂點，暫時劃破了平靜的鏡面雨點來了，他們的命運怎樣了呢？</p>

<h3>聯總的剖視　本報編譯室特稿</h3>
<p>— 家南</p>
<p>聯合國善后救濟總署和中國行政院善後救濟總署，是報紙上很時髦的名稱，差不多每天可以看到的。誰都知道曾遭戰爭破壊的國家，最迫切需要的無過於物資和技術，而聯總的職責就是把物資和技術在解放各國內執行救濟和善後，全世界人民對於這個機關予以密切的注意，寄以極大的期望，實屬理所當然！最近，爲了聯總宣佈一切工業農業設備停止運華，繼之以各方輿論的反響和停運令撤銷，鬧得滿城風雨，於是聯總和行總，更其成爲朝野上下的話題。鑒於各方對於這兩個機關的注意和關心，我們認爲有作一有系統介紹的必要。</p>
<p>先說聯總和行總成立的目的。據聯總前署長李門說：第二次世界大戰是眞正的世界大戰，侵略者的專制，曾經推廣到大約三十五國的人民，數百個島嶼和五千萬以上男女老幼的住宅。在淪陷的歐洲和被奴役的亞洲，景象到處相同，就是人民饑饉，土地荒無和各國經濟的全被毁壊，情形的慘悽，爲世界前所未有。聯合國家假如在戰塲上獲勝之後，不能對這種支離破散的局面，準備全盤的根本解決辦法，藉以遏止死亡和苦難，進而奠定持久和平的基礎，那麼必然會演成歷史上最大的悲劇。聯合國善後救濟總署，就在這種悲天憫人的目的之下誕生的。</p>
<p>一九四三年十一月九日，四十四個聯合國家（現在已增至五十二國）以及其他有關的國家在華盛頓簽訂了一個協定，成立了聯總，其主要目的，是以糧食，衣着，房屋和醫療援助給予被解放的人民，佈置遺送俘虜和難民回籍，援助恢復急需的農工生產，從消極的救濟進至積極的善後工作，使各國的經濟逐漸恢復常態，因爲眞正的繁榮，必須建築在各國的繁榮上，世界本來是不可分的。</p>
<p>國家分三類</p>
<p>大戰結束時，創傷最深，經濟摧殘最甚的國家，可分爲三類第一類包括法，比，荷，丹，挪諸國，她們的國土雖被侵佔，但是有的尙擁有殖民地，有的尙保有海外存款或握有外匯尙豐，所以自願處於國際救濟範圍之外；第二類包括波，捷，南，希諸國，她們的國土旣被侵佔，復無分文外匯，非完全依賴外國援助不可，而爲聯總初期救濟的對象；第三類國家包括義，德，日，奧，芬，匈，羅，保等戰敗國家。</p>
<p>爲了要進行這樣範圍廣大的工作，聯總的機構是很龐大的。聯總的最高權威是代表大會，每個會員國派遣代表一人，每半年開會一次，來決定聯總的預算和政策。在大會閉會期間，緊急案件山中央委員會來處理，這個委員曾是由中美英蘇四强的代表組成的。管理各區實施政策者，有遠東和歐洲兩個區域委員會，其下再分衛生，農業，工業，福利和難民五個小組委員會分門辦理。</p>
<p>聯總的經費</p>
<p>至於聯總的經費，是一筆國際共集的款子，由未遭侵略的會員國捐助。美國捐輸十三萬萬美元以上，英國本國捐出三萬萬美元以上……總算起來，聯總共有二十萬萬美元的潛在資產，充作對歐亞兩洲的供應。但是據一般估計，歐洲所需要的救濟，就達九百萬萬美元，兩相對比，便可以看出聯總並沒有獨任戰爭善後救濟的可能。</p>
<p>上面我們曾經說過遭戰爭摧殘的國家，可分爲三類。但是除此之外，尙有中國應成爲一「中間類」。因爲中國僅有人口之半淪於敵手，但是國土分裂，苦戰八年，已經一貧如洗，亟待教濟。與中國處境大略相同的，尙有蘇聯的兩個加盟國，即白俄羅斯和烏克蘭，這兩個區域曾飽受敵人的蹂躪。</p>
<p>中國的需要</p>
<p>據中國方面的估計，善後救濟事業共需美金二十五萬萬美元。照中國抗戰之久，災區之廣，和破壊之重來說，這個數目事實上還不够，但是聯總的經費總共不過二十萬萬美元，當然我們不能希望聯總給予我們超過牠總經費的援助。經再三考慮，我們祇得希望聯總協助我們九萬萬四千五百萬美元，但是聯總允許分配給我們的，僅五萬萬六千二百五十萬美元。照人口來計算，平均每人僅攤得一元二角五分，但是捷克每人平均得十六元五角九分，希臘每人平均得五十二元四角五分，阿爾巴尼亞每人平均得二十二元四角二分，白俄羅斯每人平均得三元三角三分，南斯拉夫每人平均得二十七元八角九分，波蘭每人平均得十九元三角一分，烏克蘭每人平均得三元一角三分，即前敵國義大利和奧地利亦比我國所獲爲多。我國代表雖曾就此點力爭，但結果並未成功。</p>
<p>行總的組織</p>
<p>至於行總，是中國政府成立的執行機構，組織着重於業務方面，內部分廳，處，室。廳有儲運，分配，財務，賑恤四廳，處有總務，會計，調査，編譯四處，室有人事室其法律地位，和行政院其他各部會署完全相同，正式成立於一九四五年一月二十一日，與聯總密切合作，在中國收復區內執行救濟和善後的任務。</p>
<p>據報紙消息，聯總運華物資，截至六月底止，已自一八三艘巨輪上卸下六十三萬八千九百二十一噸，其他尙有二十五艘載夾之貨尙未卸淸，十艘尙在途中。各項物資業經行總分運內地的，已有三十三萬五千五百九十噸。救濟物資，包括小麥，奶粉及其他食品，卡車，曳引機，築路機，鋼橋，發電機，平底船等。</p>
<p>中國的困難</p>
<p>但是中國境內交通的困難以及種種物質條件的限制，使分配工作，或許不能迷到完全令人滿意的程度，以致引起聯總的誤會。七月九日，聯總署長賴伽第亞宣佈聯總一切工農業設備停止運華，惟重要糧食如小麥，白米，五榖和乳品仍繼續運華，但亦以中國政府迅速出淸各口岸，及行總將救濟物資運至中國內地，以滿意方法分配爲條件。賴氏此一突兀的行動，其主要理由據說有兩點：第一，中國政府沒有供給經費，以致救濟物資，不能迅速分運內地；第二，中國政府對於共軍區域分配太少，因此懐疑政府利用救濟物資作爲政治鬥爭的工具。</p>
<p>對於此事，除了中國政府發言人已發表聲明外，行總署長蔣廷　亦已屢次加以闡明。事實上，行總的分配救濟品，絕對沒有政治作用存在其間，全視各地的需要和交通運輸的便利程度而定，此次誤會，完全由中國目前的運輸困難而起。停運令的撤銷，當然是聯總對於事實眞相已逐漸明瞭的一個佐證。</p>
<p>自助者人助</p>
<p>我們對於聯總的援助，雖在數量上尙感不敷，但是衷心的感激，決非筆墨所能形容。可是有一點値得特別注意，就是聯總救濟工作將至明春爲止，苟一九四七年我國仍無進步，則前途茫茫，更將呼　無門，政府民衆，都應正視這個現實，世界上惟有能自救者人能救之！</p>

<h3>法國·義大利　從雅爾達會議到總選舉</h3>
<p>— 君默譯自美國新聞週刊</p>
<p>法國和義大利的總選都已經揭曉了。要淸楚了解它的意義，我們必須先來看一看它的背景，那就是從雅爾達會議以來的十六個月中，法國和義大利國內官方和報紙輿論的轉變。</p>
<p>我們稍一回溯過去，即可了解，今日美國英國和蘇聯之間的許多誤會，大部都是由於雅爾達會議中那許多模棱不淸各執一是的決議案所引起的。但在法國和義大利的眼裏，雅爾達會議是一點也不模棱的。在他們看來，維爾達會議乃是一個起點，淸楚地表示了勝利的强國對於他們的藐視和冷眼。</p>
<p>在法國解放之前，戴高樂政府已經開始熱切地解釋着法國將來外交政策的立場，就是：防止德國復興以及保障自己的安全。戴高樂想像着舊日的互助同盟的復活，這次並當加以强有力的軍事條款。這個外交方針的第一步，就是和蘇聯訂結同盟條約。法國人中即使强烈的反共派也歡迎這個同盟條的，因爲他們覺得，這可以作爲一個開始，跟着就好把同盟擴大至英國，比利時和荷蘭。這個條的的系統，是準備能與聯合國的方針相附合的，但大部分的法國人對於聯合國的是否能有成就都公開表示着懐疑。</p>
<p>但這種同盟之夢立刻便碰了一個大釘子。起先，法國人狠怪美國人不該在雅爾達和後來的舊金山三巨頭會議中踢出了法國。但漸慚地，情形明白了，法國的未被邀請，主要的乃是由於蘇聯的反對。法蘇同盟與擁護者不得不張眼看淸了，原來對於這個條約，俄國人是遠不及法國人的那麽熱心看重的。這似乎可能是一帆風順的外交政策，一開碇便就擱了淺。而跟英國呢，似乎也沒有什麼訂結同盟的可能，因爲英國不願意把魯爾和萊茵區從德國劃出來，這和法國的打算是正相反的。從此以後，法國唯一想走的路，只是在聯合國中所能覓得的國際合作了。</p>
<p>義大利的情形和法國情形的主要不同點，只是，義大利所碰到的釘子更重，它想找到一條出路的希望也更急切。去年二月十日，義大利報紙上登戰，波諾米首相曾向雅爾達會議中的三巨頭要求，將義大利列入聯合國。四天以後，政府發表公報否認了一但幻想已經遍及了全國。雅爾達的巨頭們對於義大利的要求的答覆是一個完全的不理睬。這使一切美麗的幻夢都破滅了，他們原先是希望義大利在聯合國作戰中的貢獻能够被承認，來作爲解決一切過去問題的依據的。</p>
<p>自此以後，義大利的輿諭，已由怨望而悲觀，終於到今天由悲觀而嫉恨了。猜疑已使法國聽任巴黎的四國外長會議弄到了無結果而散，但義大利的創傷，却連這樣的一點安慰也沒有。唯一的稍稍安慰，只是貝爾納斯國務卿的表示支持義大利對特律斯坦的要求。</p>
<p>所以，在這次兩國的總選中，普遍的是一個失望屈辱的背景。兩國都竭力不使自己在英美蘇的大國衡突中捲入漩渦。兩國都只在最重要的國內問題上投票，在法國，是選擇一種新的憲法；在義大利，是選擇要君主還是要共和。同時，兩國也都作了一次試騐，看看共產黨和反共派的勢力的消長是如何。</p>
<p>不過，不論在法國或者在義大利，國內問題都不可能和一個更大的問題分開，那就是：如何在這互相關聯的歐洲形勢中來站定自己國家的脚跟。每個頭腦淸楚的人民都有此觀念，知道自己的國家和世界的其他部分是不可分的。但對於今日的法國人和義大利人，這個問題是最最複雜，而躊躇難定。很顯然的，這就是總選中選票上所未曾寫出的問題</p>
<h3>日本婦女在蛻變中</h3>
<p>— 嚴晉譯自合衆社特稿</p>
<p>日本的婦女，數千年來都是被男子所奴役的，現在因了日本的戰敗，已從這種奴役中解放出來，準備挺身担負亞洲和平的責任了。</p>
<p>大體地說起來，日本婦女在知識程度上是比亞洲其他任何國家的婦女爲高。中國。固然也有很偉大的婦女領袖，如蔣夫人等，但大部分的中國農村婦女，都是未受過敎育的。亞洲其他國家的情形，也是如此。</p>
<p>日本婦女今日已淸楚看出：如果她們當初曾積極地參加日本的政治，那末這塲弄到國破家亡的戰爭也許就可能避免。她們今日已淸楚看透這種傳統的封建制度的悲劇，它要婦女們關在家裏，不問世事。</p>
<p>從前，女人只是家庭的奴隸，要伺候每一個人的起居寒暖，於是就絕無時間能過問外面的一切活動。結果，非但於世界大事一無所知，就連國內所發生的一切，也都是被蒙在鼓裹。</p>
<p>軍閥用那種所謂三從四德的「女訓」來維護這種封建制度，……即所謂家庭制度，……以便推行他們的侵略政策。他們認爲日本婦女應該盲目服從，同時，他們把一切對自己政策不利的消息都隱瞞了起來。</p>
<p>但這一切都已隨着日本的戰敗而過去了，現在，已開始了一個新的時代。</p>
<p>在這次大選中，日本婦女已表顯了她們對政治的熱心和興趣。四月十日的大選中，參加投票的婦女達一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人之多。</p>
<p>大選以前，許多評諭家猜測，日本婦女大部分對於政治都是漢不關心的，所以選舉中棄權的人可能達到百分之八十。但結果呢，事實表現，未去投票的，十人中不過三人。</p>
<p>戰爭不但攫走了她們的丈夫和兒子，而且也給婦女們帶來了家庭生活中不可言喻的苦痛。食物亦十分難於得到。今日，由於耕種工具和肥料的缺乏，糧食甚至比戰時更少了。也因爲了這種原因，日本婦女已痛下决心，不能讓又一次的戰爭爆發，並且將竭盡全力來防止下一次的戰爭。</p>
<p>爲了避免任何國際間的衝突，亞洲的婦女們都應該有這個責任。</p>

<p>也許她顯得過於隱約微小，而飄忽。牠不能像皎潔的月亮，照給你一片淸亮幽麗的光華，靜盪在遼闊的高空使你讚嘆，使你依戀。她僅孤寂地放出了幾絲淡弱的微光，就迅速地爲其牠陸續出現的繁星所掩蓋住，一剎時你再也不能找出牠來。然而，假使你不是一個健忘的低能者，你總不會忘記這最先我用幾絲淡弱的微先，爲你照明那沉暗的夜色的第一顆小星吧！</p>
<p>第一顆小星！是的，在我黯淡的生命中，也曾有過一顆永遠不能忘懷的小星！</p>
<p>十年前，在某古僻的山城一所貴族化的古學校裏，我是一個孤獨凄苦的女孩子。</p>
<p>和別人沒有兩樣，才由金黃色的童年的夢中醒來時，包圍着我的是美麗的靑春，熱烈的情緒，和遙遠的希望。對着一面晶亮的小鏡，我曾爲自己暈紅雙頰眞心地歡笑過；揑着同伴們嫩白的纎手，我曾從心底流出過最誠摯的熱流；抱着一疊疊逐漸加厚的書本，我曾寫寄託過無限的志願，無窮的熱望。……可是，一踏進那所貴族學校的大門，我的熱忱和希望，一剎那都如遇了冰一樣冷下來了！</p>
<p>冰！是的，我遇見了人間最冷酷尖厲的冰，勢利的冷眼！</p>
<p>當初次看見許多穿綢戴金的同學，用識笑的眼光望着我身上一件破舊的藍布旗袍時，我心中湧起的是憤怒和反抗。我覺得究有什麼可羞，我只要用功讀書，用超優的成績去勝過她們，使教師們看重，怕她們什麼呢？</p>
<p>於是，我發憤地捧起我的書本，淸晨，靜夜，我苦苦地埋頭在艱澀的書堆裏，低低的唸，慢慢的算，又細細的把唸過算過的反覆背誦。我知道自己盡了所有的能力，我預料定能勝過所有的同學，讓我在那些識笑輕視我的人面前出口氣。</p>
<p>然而我失望了！在熱鬧的學期結束時，竟眼看着一個個同學走上台去，從校長手裏接過一塊塊光榮的獎牌，她們驕傲地望着我，她們底臉上，現出得意的微笑，似乎在說：「嘿！你這窮鬼！你這笨蟲！你想比得過我們嗎」。</p>
<p>痛苦和黑暗一重重壓下來，我的憤怒消失了，我的勇氣也消失了。像一頭迷失在黑夜中的小羊，望不見一線光明，只有一串串苦澀的眼淚，不斷地從我一雙圓大的眼睛裏滾下來。</p>
<p>雖僅是個十八歲的少女，但我已開始詛咒歲月的冗長，悲嘆人生的虛渺。在一羣活潑幸福的小姐們的中間，我孤獨地沉着臉，如同一個七八十歲的老人，把日子浪費在消極凄凉的嘆息裏。</p>
<p>那是個深秋的傍晚，照例草地上有一片片輕快的笑聲，同學們歡悅地跳着玩着，只有我，獨自在一個陰暗的牆角低頭徘徊。</p>
<p>「來了！來了！……喔！還有阿陸，小鳳……要不要去喊她們一同來？」</p>
<p>「好！好！……你們快快去喊！……喂！別忘記叫各人帶個杯子來放可可茶，再別忘記帶把小刀來削蘋果！……」</p>
<p>一陣尖脆的笑喊寂靜下來後，小楓樹下就充滿了鮮紅的旗袍，鬆軟的鬈髪，丰滿的嬌顏，麵包，奶油，蘋果！可可茶……然而我，還是在陰暗的牆角邊默默地走着，走着。……</p>
<p>淡淡的夕陽過來了靜靜的射上紅磚砌成的矮牆。我側轉頭，看見了自己黑黝黝的影子，是那麼孤單，那麼凄涼，終於我的眼淚又流下來了！</p>
<p>「噯！我這樣的窮，又這樣的笨，人家看不起我，不理睬我，我還要讀什麼書！還不如死了的好！」</p>
<p>我痛苦地繫着自己的頭，恨恨地把夾在腋下的二本書向地上摔去，並未注意到我的背後，正有一個細長的身影，在緩緩地走過來。</p>
<p>「啊！什麼事不高興，把書都摔掉了？」</p>
<p>我爲那個溫柔的聲音所驚住。擦掉眼邊的淚珠，仰起頭來時，我看見了一張圓圓的臉，一副深厚的眼鏡，一排崎嶇不整齊的牙齒。……我認識她，她是小學部裏一位新來的代課先生，</p>
<p>「喔，謝謝你……」我看見她抬起我摔下的書，重新放在我的手裏，我的臉孔發着燒，不知道如何說法。</p>
<p>「別客氣！我常常見你獨自在這裏走，你是高一的同學吧？尊姓？」</p>
<p>「是的，我在高一，……我沒有敢向她看，低低的答着，」</p>
<p>「我姓張，……」</p>
<p>「張啊！那麼我們是同姓！我也姓張！」她笑起來了，突然揑住我的手，親　地說：「我們到那邊茅亭裏去，坐着談談，好嗎？」</p>
<p>夕陽逐漸移過去，晚風漸漸的大了。宿舍後面的小園很寂靜，只有幾個秋蟲躲在草裏吱吱的叫着。</p>
<p>倚着她細長的身影默然坐在茅亭裏時，我的頭依舊低垂着，因此我看淸楚了她脚上一雙半新半舊的老　　布底鞋子，在我心中，湧起一種莫名的感觸。</p>
<p>園子裏幾排白色的雛菊散放出陣陣幽雅的淸香，她深深地吸了一口氣，微笑地望着我說：</p>
<p>「這地方多麼好！你們在這裏讀書，眞是福氣，爲什麼你還要不開心把書摔在地上？」</p>
<p>「福氣是福氣的，可惜…我對她一聲苦笑，沒有說下去。」</p>
<p>「可惜什麼呢？」她的頭湊近些我，溫柔地問。</p>
<p>「……」我沉默着不敢回答，但我又注意到了她脚上一雙半舊的布底鞋。我終於大膽地說：「我是個窮苦的女孩子，這裏太貴族化了，我感到痛苦。……」</p>
<p>一陣簌簌的風吹斷了我的話，吹蓬了我的頭。我伸起手，整理一下披落在臉上的短髮時，突然發覺她在對我看，從頭頂到脚跟，又從脚跟回到頭頂，她把我細細的打量着。</p>
<p>「你是爲了自己窮而感到痛苦嗎？啊！那沒有關係！」她笑着說：「我在師範裏讀書的時候，衣服上常常打着補釘，但我不去管她！同學們的譏笑，輕視，由她們去，別人穿綢着緞，也由別人去，我只管自己用心讀書就是！……」</p>
<p>「你的話不錯，我起先也這樣想過做過，但我非但窮，又實在太笨了！我盡了所有的力，還是沒有一樣能勝過別人，……」我正在低低地說下去，憂地她伸過一雙手來截住了我。</p>
<p>「勝過別人！爲什麼你要想勝過別人。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼你要想勝過別人？」這句問話是新鮮的，我從未問過自己，也從未聽到別人問過我，然而她竟問我了。</p>
<p>「我……我難道不應該這樣想嗎？」我回答不出，茫然地望着她說。</p>
<p>「是的，你不應該這樣想！」她沉靜肯定地回答我後，把搭在我肩上的手取下來，微微笑着說：「想勝過別人，有時候確是好的，能鼓勵人努力向上，但大半時候，却增加了人的痛苦和罪惡；使人嫉妒，使人失望，使人灰心，甚至使人頹喪而死，我想你的痛苦，大槪由這思想而來，所以我希望你不要再有此思想，……」</p>
<p>說到這裏她垂下眼睛望望我手裏的書，把一本硬面的幾何取了去，翻開裏而繪着圓周半徑的一頁，向我這：「你是知道圓周的畫法的，是不是只要有半徑，無論那半徑是一尺，一寸或一分，都能畫成一個完全的三百六十度的圓圈。我覺得做人也恰像畫圓圈一樣，雖然天賦與各人的半徑不一律，有貧富，有智慧，但每個人都能用自己的半徑來畫一個無缺陷的三百六十度的圓圈。所以我們不必去羨慕別人的富貴聰敏，也不必想去勝過別人，我們只要盡我們的力，在我們自己的能力範圍內，也能達到一個完全無缺陷的人生……」</p>
<p>聽他說完這些話，我的頭抬了起來，用欣喜感激的眼光望着她，因爲我突然感到自己面前明亮了。我又看見了澄淸的藍天，美麗的白雲，香的花，綠的草，……我又似平看見在藍天綠草之間，一條幽靜平坦的道路爲了我而開放了，我不再是一頭迷途的小羊，我已經認識了自己該走的路。……</p>
<p>「謝謝你！你的話開導了我，我明白了，我眞高興！我希望每天能和你談談！」被一陣響脆的晚飯鈴聲催逼着跨出茅亭時，我竟忘了麗生，拉住了她的手，聲音像小孩子一樣奮興。</p>
<p>「我也很喜歡常和你談談，可惜我僅是來代課，在別地我還有些事要辦，所以說不定明天就要走的！」她微笑着，帶些惋惜的口氣說。</p>
<p>果然，第二天她就走了。也許爲了匆促，她沒有留下一個地址，也沒有再同我講過話，默默地離開了我們的學校；消失在茫茫的人海中了！</p>
<p>流光是迅速的，一閃眼十年悄悄地過去。這十年中，我認識了許多良師益友，聽到了數不淸的訓誨激勵，正彷彿沉暗的高空下，已爍閃起滿天繁星，懸掛起明潔的月亮；然而我永遠不能忘記她，永遠不能忘記這最先用幾絲淡弱的微光，來爲我照明那沉暗的夜色的第一顆小星！</p>
<h3>風景</h3>
<p>— 鄭震刻</p>
<h3>巴耳·蒲爾石（下）</h3>
<p>— 錫壽</p>
<p>這些小說出版時候，很受到自然主義者的批評，因爲這些小說中的人物大都是取自上流社會的，而當時的自然主義者幾乎都不承認上流社會的存在。蒲爾石是注力於描摹現實底各面的，他認爲「上流社會」的研究亦是在小說家的努力範圍內的。他之所以選了上流社會，却也有一個理由，因爲他覺得上流社會中的人物不大有物質的掛慮，職業的牽累，情感是格外的奔放一點，分析起來格外順手一點。他的許多長篇小說，如昂特列郭爾奈里思（Andrd　Corneles　1887），一個婦人的心（Un　coeur　de　fenune　1890），各司莫巴利司（Cosmopolis　1893），一首悲慘的牧歌（Une　idylle　tragique　1896），中篇小說如復始（Recommencements　1897），感情的錯綜（Complications　sentimentales　1898）心的曲折（Les　detourdu　coeur　1808）等等都是分析情感的作品。可是他最大的成功是於一八八九年出版的那部在文學界上同時在他自己的著作內劃時代的弟子　Le　disciple　。這部小說問世以後，他底作品的特點達到了最高點，他也就決然地走出了他的摸索時期。它顯示出了蒲爾石的更廣大的專注。從此以後，他不衹是一個心理小說家，而還是一個提出了著者的精神上的責任問題的道德家了。這種道德家的嚴重的口氣，我們是可以從那篇作爲序文的「致一個靑年」中看得出來的：「你是在我們這些做你的長兄的人們底著作中找尋着那些使你痛苦着的問題的回答……在那些著作中所碰到的回答，是和你的精神生活有點利害關係，和你的靈魂有點利害關係的；——你的精神生活，正就是法蘭西底精神生活；你的靈魂就是它的靈魂。二十年之後，你和你的弟兄們將把這個老舊的國家——我們的公共的母親——底命脈抓在掌握之中。你們將成爲這國家底本身。那時，在我們的著作中，你將採得點什麼，你們將採得點什麼？想到了這件事的時候，凡是正直的文士——不論他是如何地無足重輕——就沒有一個會不因爲自己所負的責任之重大而戰戰兢兢着的……」弟子是一本說明一種哲學學說的心理小說，是一本不朽的名著。內容叙述一個少年私淑一著名心理學者，少年本着科學方法作惡，其冷酷無情令人可怕。他欲以其著者在書中歷數唯美主義和唯物主義的罪惡，大張理想主義的旗幟。作者寫照心靈狀態，——尤其是近今的心靈狀態，——在牠的構造和變遷上，如此其深切而明白，使我們眞是覺得自然主義寫照生理的淺薄而無味！他不但攻擊自然主義那種對於人生冷酷的態度之無可取，並且指出這種不負責任的唯物哲學之有害於人生。此書問世後，從此他反自然主義和反實證主義的態度益明，後來愈趨愈甚。對於道德的熱心使他變成了一個守舊主義者和舊教主義者，這種趨勢在他後來的作品裏更加明顯。他以社會學家的態度和心理學家的觀察，得了一個結論，是：社會的改造，要應當更有安靜的秩序，更有道德的生活。這種秩序和生活應當是基督教的社會。驛站（L'etape　1903）一個離婚（Un　divorce　1904），亡命者（L'emigre　1907），平民主義的論客（Le　Tribun　1911戲劇），正午的魔鬼（Le　demon　de　midi　19e14），死的意義（Le　sens　de　la　mort　1915），奈美西思（Nmesis　1918）和一個世上的悲劇（Un　crame　dans　le　mondes1929）等，都是他極其用力提倡加得力教復興的作品。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年至第一次歐戰前，蒲爾石在法國文壇上很有勢力，頗得靑年人的信仰，差不多全世界人都看他的作品，他簡直是靑年的領袖。但到歐戰後，他仍舊保持着原來的面目，毫不進步，也無變動，只不過是一個名人，與其餘的法蘭西學士院委員一樣，同世間並無關涉般地，近年來幾乎被人遺忘了。</p>
<p>蒲爾石是擅長寫照中上流社會的文學家，是司湯達爾以後，第一個最有權威的心理解析的小說家。他是以忍耐而略帶笨重的手搜索着，詳細地冗長地，但又有力而深切地描寫心靈的狀態和變化。本來十九世紀末年那種社交人物內容的複雜，心態的變幻，也非蒲爾石這種細謹的觀察和精緻的筆墨寫他不出。自從司湯達爾以後，眞果再無人能夠這樣熟習的解析內心。沒有一種現象上，他不示我們以內心的作用。有時或者過於纖細一些，但是他的聰明和知識，都足以使我們心眼不落空的隨着他的手術，一層一層的向裏面去，毫不覺得繁贅。如像在弟子裏，他用了一百五十頁來單指出一個靑年，自小孩以至成人，關於他心理變態的一切環境和勢力。那種精密的研究，眞是令人可驚！他的小說真可符戴納所期望的一種精神歷史的文件（Un　docnment　d'histoire　morole）。</p>
<p>蒲爾石像法朗士和絲蒂一樣，是騎跨兩個世紀的作家一生中有六十年是浸在文學生涯中，非常勤勞，產量豐富；各種樣式的著作，總共有六十餘本。其中最成功的著作不外以下幾本：（一）小說：殘酷的迷，一個愛情的罪惡，昂特列郭爾奈里，謊話，弟子，一個婦人的心，福地（La　Terre　promise　1892），各司莫巴利司，一首悲慘的牧歌，幻影（Le　fantome　1901），深水（L'eau　profonde　1903），驛站，一個離婚，移民，正午的魔鬼，死的感覺，阿耳拔尼（Laurence　Albani　1919），我們的行為跟隨着我們（Nos　actions　nous　suivent　1927），一個世上的悲劇和法官（Le　justicier　193×）等。（二）戲劇：移民（L'emigre　1908），一個離婚（與A.　Cury　合編　1908），防堵（La　barricade　1910），平民主義的論客，危迫之時（La　crise與A.Beaunier　合編　1912）等。（三）論文及其他：現代心研究，新的研究，研究與寫眞，談意大利（Sensations　d'ltalie　1891），批評與主義（Pages　de　critiques　et　de　c'octrine　1912），批評與主義續集（Nouvelles　pages　de　critiques　et　de　doctrine1922）和治安的職務（Au　service　de　l'ordre　1929）等〔完〕</p>

<h3>我愛講的故事</h3>
<p>— 侃侃</p>
<p>明天是八八父親節，我把這個故事貢戲給年輕的讀者們。</p>
<p>黎明的時候，天下着雨，在英國的利士非爾地方，一所小書店剛開門，裏面有一個傴僂的老人正在包裹書籍；那老人因爲身體衰弱，不勝工作之苦，咳嗽了兩聲，就不能再繼續工作了。</p>
<p>「薩密爾！」老人輕輕地叫了一聲。</p>
<p>那邊坐着的健壯少年正在看書，沒有回答。</p>
<p>「薩密爾！」老人又叫道，但是他還未理會那老人。</p>
<p>老人只好自己把書包好，吃力地把它放在籃裏，接着又咳嗽了幾聲，第三次叫道：「薩密爾！」</p>
<p>這時，藝密爾才慢慢地抬起頭來答道：「爸爸：什麼事？」</p>
<p>「明天是阿克塞特地方的市集期，我們的書攤要人照管，但是，我的身體疲乏極了，而且天又下着雨……。」老人說</p>
<p>蕯密爾慢慢地答道：「是的，看見了這種情形，我也覺得不舒服。」</p>
<p>「或者讓我留在店裏，你去趕市吧！」</p>
<p>但是，嚴密爾還是低頭看書，沒有答應。</p>
<p>老人走到門外，望了一望天，雨遠沒有停，他就穿了外衣，拿了書籃，咳着嗽出去了·</p>
<p>門外的雨依舊沒有停止·</p>
<p>五十年以後，那一天，又逢阿克塞特的市集期，天也下着雨·</p>
<p>這時一輛馬車從利士非爾來，停在市塲內，一個老人從車中走出，他手裏拿着手杖，氣喘地走入市塲。</p>
<p>這位從異鄉來的老人，四處走了一回，就站在一個荒　的前面，目言自言地：「是了，就是在這裏·」</p>
<p>他把帽子脫下來，挾在脅下，又把手杖放在地上，呆呆地立在雨中·</p>
<p>市塲裏的時鐘打了十一下·他仍立在那裏不動，雨從他的頭上淋下來，遍身都濕透了。</p>
<p>這時，有個鹵莽的少年突然問道：「這個癡老人是誰呀？」</p>
<p>是英國著名作家薩密爾，約翰遜，誰不認識他？」一個人代答着。</p>
<p>時鐘已噹噹地打了十二下，奇怪的老人才抬頭望了望天，慢慢地走出市塲回去了。</p>
<p>薩密爾回家後，對人說：「五十年前，我不曾答應父親的話，沒有替他服務，衷心非常懊悔，今天到阿克塞特去一趟，略爲表示我的懺悔罷了！」說罷大哭</p>
<p>鬥外的雨依舊沒有停止。</p>
<h3>安全第一</h3>
<p>— 重征</p>
<p>根據警察局上月可靠的統計，汽車肇禍者有二百八十三次之多，平均算起來，每天要發生九次以上，不管每一次肇禍是否碾死或碾傷人，這現象，却使人人自危！</p>
<p>照這樣下去，馬路確比虎口還更加危險。</p>
<p>假使，一個好好的人，在抗戰八年中、前方沒有被敵人打死，後方沒有被飛機炸死，今日，戰爭勝利，凱旋歸來，竟無謂地將小命斷送在汽車輪下，血淋淋的被碾死在馬路上，這不是太寃枉嗎？</p>
<p>爲了全上海三百七十萬市民的生命保障，我們要大聲疾呼，請本市負責指揮與管理交通的當局，切實住意這個嚴重的問題，迅速地想出妥善的辦法來！</p>
<p>性命交關，不是小事！</p>

<p>在一所舊式的統廂房裏，主人翁是卅多歲的短身材，悶聲不語，每天早晨踏了自由車去辦公室，五點鐘又踏了回來。他抱不費分文的主義，所以不吸烟，不飲酒，不嫖，不賭，不下棋，不看書，不運動，不捐款。甚至於電影，戲劇。公園都不上門。他家庭內的妻·子，女，僕，一切的行動，都不在他的心上。任你天翻地覆，都使他不聞不見。他唯一的生活是做職員，拿薪水，做小投機。他簡直沒有人生觀。他的妻年齡相仿，身材結實·聲音洪亮，拿手的本領是麻將。目早晨起身開塲可以搓到明天。早晨什麽「一扳高」，「靑龍」，「百搭」，「寺滾瓜」爛熟，祇要坐在麻將桌上，一牌在手，萬事都休。任是寒天大雪，夏月盛暑，柴米油鹽，兒啼女號，風雨雷電，都不能搖動他的牌興；假使原子彈在上海試騐，她可以同比基尼島山羊吃草一般的鎭靜。他的子女衣衫襤褸，汚垢滿身，學費太昻，便停止入學；在家中踢球打架，室中一架沙喉嚨的無綫電收音機鬼叫般的開起來，低級趣味的滑稽申曲越劇等，連篇不斷的冗長廣吿，某路某號某公館買什麼丸，某小姐買什麼散，都有胃口聽；而四鄰的寗靜空氣都成了大世界雜要塲或是商店大拍賣。她的女僕震天價響的嗓子，從早到晚不是笑，便是呼，便是駡，眞是吵得雞犬不寗，馬仰人翻。在此種種情形之下，這位主人翁慢斯條理的揩他的自由車，或是坐在室中發呆。牌聲，無綫電聲，笑聲，駡聲，哭聲，鬧聲，打架聲，都引不起他的一絲一毫的感覺。咳，如此家庭！</p>

<h3>補習</h3>
<p>— 蕭繼璋</p>
<p>上星期日，有幾位同學來玩，大家因爲許多未晤面，一旦相逢目不免談笑風生，互道近况，從談話之中，得知他們近來請了一位補習先生，每逢一，三，五，大家集在一起補習英文，臨行時承他們不棄，叮囑我明天下午到他們那裏去聽講，並且還希望我也去參加！</p>
<p>翌日，因爲有約在先，只得冒署趕去，大概是我去得太早了一點，這位先生還未來，而我那幾位同學都圍在一張桌子上打羅宋牌九，我對此毫們興趣，所以也只有默默坐在一旁，翻閱報紙消遺！</p>
<p>約模一小時光景這位先生才姗姗來了，矮胖的身體，配着一套香港衫褲，樣子很滑稽，假使不說破，誰也不敢相信他是敎書的先生，或許還會疑心他是那家洋行的跑街！</p>
<p>照理，先生來了，大家應該收拾殘局，可是我這幾位同學正玩得高興的時候，誰也不肯先說停手，他們一面繼續工作，一面却語先生躺在床上休息一會，讓他們再玩一圈後再補習，這位先生倒也很會迎合心理，嘴裏叫他們別性急，慢慢的玩好了，身體也就慢慢倒在床上，眞的，閉着眼睛在休息！</p>
<p>好容易他們歇了手，先生也休息得差不多了，然後才開始敎書，桌子旁邊擺着西瓜，汽水等夏令冷飲，邊吃邊敎，樣子倒還算認眞、冷飲吃完了，態度也散怠了，到後來率性合攏書本，大家攀談起來，東南西北胡扯一陣，時間很快溜走了，這位補習先生也就拿起草帽大搖大擺走出了門口。</p>
<p>我本來是想加人他們一起補習的，可是這樣一看，我寗可在家睡午覺，也不願大熱天在街上跑來跑去活受罪。</p>
<p>這樣的補習，欺騙了自已，難爲了父親！</p>

<h3>Statement from State Department Spokesperson: US Policy Toward China Unchanged, Denies Plans to Withdraw American Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] A State Department spokesperson stated today that the rumors coming from Nanjing that President Truman had instructed Marshal Marshall to plan the withdrawal of American troops from China are incorrect. The spokesperson emphasized that current US policy toward China remains as Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced on June 28th and has not changed. The spokesperson, when referring to Acheson's statement that a general review of the Chinese situation would be conducted soon, stated that the so-called "review" does not necessarily mean a change in policy, but merely a clarification of the US position. The spokesperson refused to say when the "review" would be conducted at a press conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] The day after returning to his Qingdao headquarters, US Seventh Fleet Commander Admiral Cooke met with Garrison Commander Ding Zhipan, Mayor Li Xianliang, and others. At 1:30 PM, he met with Qingdao reporters on the flagship ESTES, first giving a general description of his trips to Nanjing, Guling, and Shanghai. He then spoke about the Anping incident, stating that it is indeed necessary for US troops to withdraw from China, but the timing of the withdrawal is not fixed and will not be affected by the Anping incident. He added that if US troops stationed in various locations are attacked again, the US military will take effective retaliatory measures. Finally, answering reporters' questions, he said that the three American soldiers injured in Anping have been sent to Qingdao for medical treatment, and the relatives of the injured will be notified.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 6th] Major General Keller E. Rockey, Commander of US Marines in North China, said last night that he had not yet received orders regarding the withdrawal of US troops from China, but the number of American troops in Tianjin has indeed decreased. After the sniper attack on American soldiers on the 29th of last month, the US military has frequently made movements, and the garrison in certain locations has been strengthened. Currently, the mission of the US military in Tianjin is to guard US military property, protect the railway between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, the Pingjin Highway, and the bridges at other key points. In addition, they are responsible for handling supply matters for the US military in North China. As for the families of US soldiers, none are currently coming to China. Although the situation is serious, it is believed that the US military in North China is sufficient to cope with any environment. The US military in Tianjin includes ground troops and an air unit, which are currently intensifying training, but the sole purpose is to stabilize the situation and implement Marshal Marshall's plan.</p>
<h3>Investigation Procedure Dispute Unresolved: Special Group to Anping Delayed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The special group dispatched by the Military Mediation Department to investigate the American troop ambush case at Da Xiao Shahe was unable to depart again today. The main reason is the dispute over procedures. The North China side agreed to first send liaison personnel to ensure the safety of the group. Regarding the so-called procedural dispute, the government side stated that the communist side proposed that the CCP first draft a proposal for investigation procedures. Based on these procedures, the scope of the special group's investigation would include many areas in eastern Hebei, which the American side opposed. According to communists, the American side proposed that the investigation procedures must be in accordance with the small group actions agreed upon by Barr and the Three-Man Committee in Nanjing, and that the American representative could propose an agreement on procedures with the qualifications of chairman, but it would still be drafted by the American side. The communist side believes that since the American side is a party involved in this incident, it should not be bound by that agreement. This issue is still under negotiation. In addition, all three parties attach special importance to the selection of representatives for the group. The government side has changed its representative to Deng Weiren, Deputy Director of the Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 6th] Colonel Davis, leader of the Military Mediation Department's special group, began today to investigate the clash between American troops and communist troops near Anping on the Pingjin Highway on the 29th of last month in order to determine responsibility.

Before five minutes had passed, his advisor urged him to get into the car and leave. A record of the ambassador's answers to reporters' questions is as follows: He does not want to make any comments on the departure of the US military from China at this time.

As for the peace negotiations between the KMT and the CCP, he hopes that they will not be affected by any other incidents. The future of the negotiations is still promising. From Stuart's remarks, reporters also learned that his two talks with the Chairman involved the reorganization of the government.</p>

Even while ill, he has not forgotten his mission to run for peace talks.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>International Democracy and World Peace</h3>
<p>The European peace conference has been in session for a week, listening to representatives from 21 countries deliver speeches and state their views on post-war international politics. The 21 countries, regardless of size or strength, have an equal opportunity to freely express their opinions and are equally valued by other countries. This magnificent Luxembourg Palace has become an open international forum, which cannot be denied as a major progress in modern international politics, and can also be seen as a prelude to international democratization. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said proudly in Paris: "The main purpose of the meeting is to allow representatives of all countries to express their opinions as much as possible, so I propose that the four powers should let the other 17 countries express their views on the draft treaty first; I also request that the five committees for reviewing the draft treaty should be chaired by representatives from countries other than the four powers." After hearing this enlightened speech, we almost believe that post-war international politics has entered a new era of peace and democracy. Countries, regardless of size or strength, and regardless of their contribution to the war, have an equal opportunity to speak in international politics; and the power politics that we have deeply hated will become a vestige of the times.</p>
<p>However, after the conference entered its second week, the representatives' speeches came to an end, and the actual work of the conference was about to begin; and the procedural issues that need to be resolved urgently were even more pressing. The day before yesterday, the conference's procedural committee met to discuss the methods and procedures for deliberation and voting. There were great differences of opinion among the countries, and there were great disputes, which were almost impossible to compromise; especially Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted on his own opinions and refused to compromise, not only opposing the amendments to the conference procedure proposed by the British and Dutch, but also vehemently criticizing the attitude of the American representative, which was inconsistent. The air in the procedural committee suddenly became tense. On the surface, this procedure is only a disagreement between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, that is, the Soviet Union insists that the proposal must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the conference before it can be established; while the United Kingdom and the United States believe that it can be established as long as it is approved by a majority of the conference. If this is the case, the problem is not complicated, nor does it have major significance, and there is no need to pay too much attention to it. This is just a conflict of interest between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States. However, in fact, this is a question of whether large and small countries are equal or not, that is, a question of whether international democracy is democratic or not, so all countries in the world, especially small and medium-sized countries, attach great importance to this and insist on the original proposal and refuse to compromise, which may put the conference in a deadlock.</p>
<p>But we want to ask, why does the Soviet Union insist that all resolutions passed by the conference must be approved by a two-thirds majority? After studying the composition of the representatives of the 21 countries attending the conference, it is not difficult to fully understand. Although the Soviet Union is in a leading position internationally, there are relatively few countries that share its goals and aspirations, so in any international conference, it is easy to encounter the pain of being a lone wolf; but how to maintain its special position in the international community so as to be equal to the United Kingdom and the United States? Therefore, it came up with a clever way to "control the majority with a minority." At the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union firmly insisted that the conference procedure should adopt a two-thirds majority method, and even more demanded that the permanent members of the Security Council exercise the "veto power" for the UN Charter. Since the establishment of the UN General Assembly, the Soviet Union has frequently exercised its veto power, which has caused great pain to the United Kingdom and the United States, and they have had to launch a movement to abolish the "veto power" internationally. In this conference, there are also five or six countries that follow the Soviet Union's lead, and there are also some countries' representatives who are in between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, hesitating and watching, and not taking a fixed position for the time being. When the conference submits the proposal to a vote, if the Soviet Union expresses its objection and does not want the proposal to be established, the Soviet Union can easily obtain the support of one-third of the countries, obstructing it and making it impossible to establish. In this way, any proposal that the Soviet Union does not agree with will not be established. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States, although they are in an advantageous position in this 21-country conference, it is easier to obtain a majority than a two-thirds majority, so they advocate adopting a majority voting method. However, in order to express their concession to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom also advocates that these two methods, namely majority voting and two-thirds majority, should be adopted concurrently in order to take into account the interests of both parties. Unexpectedly, it was met with the firm opposition of the Soviet representative, causing a dispute in the meeting.</p>
<p>This newspaper's editorial, on the day the conference opened, advised the representatives of the participating countries to hope that the conference would adopt democratic methods to create world peace. We still adhere to this wish, review the procedures that the conference should adopt, and express our objection to any method that does not conform to democratic principles. Although we warmly hope that the conference will proceed smoothly and be successful, we do not agree with the method of seeking perfection at the expense of principles, only respecting the views of the four powers, and ignoring the opinions of small countries. Since the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria have been drafted by the foreign ministers of the four powers, if they are unwilling to accept the opinions of small countries, then the conference will lose its significance of being convened, and it cannot but be considered that the four powers are just using the form of a conference to sign the peace treaties, and all decision-making power is in the hands of the four powers, which is completely the same as the peace conferences convened after previous world wars. What's more, the opinions among the four powers today are not the same, and it can be seen from the general situation in the procedural issues of the conference. How can such a conference complete its task of creating a permanent and reasonable peace? The Dutch representative said: "Any method that is unfair to the interests of small and medium-sized countries is enough to hinder the peaceful development of the international community." Australian Foreign Minister Evatt even spoke on behalf of the small and medium-sized countries, demanding that the conference adopt a democratic and open method to conduct a review of various issues. The voices of these small countries' representatives are worth pondering by the representatives of all countries.</p>
<p>In short, if international democracy cannot be realized one day, then true world peace cannot be created one day. Although the purpose of this 21-country conference is to create a local peace in Europe, it has a very close relationship with the future overall peace of the world. Whether the post-war world can enter a new era of peace and democracy, this Paris conference is a new test in the world's future.</p>
<h3>Regional Dispatches</h3>
<p>Facilitating Commerce, Travel, and Military Transportation: Repairing the Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Yangzhou Bureau] The Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway is the only major route connecting Yangzhou County and Yizheng County. It is also the sole military communication line between Yangzhou and Yizheng. The road is 28 *li* long. Since the victory, it has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist troops, obstructing military transportation and commercial travel. Most of the bridge structures along the way (such as the First Bridge, Second Bridge, Yanhu Bridge, Third Bridge, Qiligou, Fourth Bridge, Bazib Bridge, etc.), have been completely destroyed, with only the main beams or foundations remaining. The local county government here recently felt the necessity of restoring traffic on this road for both military transport and commercial travel. Earlier this month, a special commissioner was dispatched to the road, under the protection of a certain unit of the 108th National Army Brigade. Together with the Yizheng County government, they surveyed the road in preparation for repairs. It was learned yesterday (the 3rd) that the surveying has been completed. The county government has already prepared the materials needed for the repairs, so construction is expected to begin within days. Once the Yangzhou-Yizheng Highway is repaired, it will certainly benefit general travelers and greatly enhance the vitality of military transport.</p>
<p>Northeast Anhui Recovered Areas: Actively Providing Relief to Refugees; Party-Government Supervision Team Established in Bengbu</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Bengbu Bureau] After the National Army successively recovered Wuhe, Lingbi, Sixian, Tianchang, and Xuyi counties in northeastern Anhui Province, the local area was ravaged by war, and order has yet to be restored. The displaced victims are in urgent need of relief. The Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, and Provincial Assembly have jointly formed a Party-Government Work Supervision Team for the Recovered Areas of Northeast Anhui to supervise general local party and government work and promote post-disaster relief efforts in preparation for reconstruction. It is learned that the team is based at the former site of the municipal party headquarters in this city. The team leader, Wan Changyan, and deputy team leaders, Li Renfu, Chen Xiannan, and others, arrived in Bengbu from Hefei on the 1st. After days of deployment in Bengbu, preparations are largely complete, and supervisory work will soon begin. According to the person in charge of the team, the main tasks of the team in the future are to provide relief to refugees and pacify the area. The work plan includes organizing *baojia* (local security units) to secure residents, providing emergency relief to aid the people with food, eradicating locusts to protect the autumn harvest, and promoting epidemic prevention to emphasize hygiene. For emergency relief, the Anhui Relief Branch will first distribute 1,000 tons of flour. The authorities have promised to provide a large supply of epidemic prevention drugs. All staff members will depart from Bengbu within days to various counties in the recovered areas to advance the work in accordance with established procedures.</p>
<p>Taixian: Emergency Repair of the Baojia Dam Completed</p>
<p>The Baojia Dam, located outside the East Gate of this county, is the hub of the upper and lower river courses. On the evening of the 27th, during a major thunderstorm, a corner of the dam suddenly collapsed. River water surged upwards. After residents braved the heavy rain to repair it, it collapsed again shortly after. The next morning, the city river water of this county was about to reach the banks. The residences of several riverside households were already flooded. After receiving the report, the county government immediately ordered officials to conscript labor for emergency repairs, which have now been completed. According to records, the dam once collapsed in 1921. In the 25 years since, there have only been a few minor instances of water overflowing, and no major disasters have occurred. If the county government had not handled the situation properly this time, the autumn harvest in the lower river area would have been unimaginable.</p>

<h3>At the Peace Conference Rules Committee Meeting: U.S. and Soviet Representatives Engage in Verbal Sparring; The Voting System Issue Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Bureau] Paris, 6th, Broadcast: The Peace Conference Rules Committee met today. Molotov spoke after Bernes, still insisting on a two-thirds voting system, claiming that this method was used at the San Francisco Conference, and the Soviet delegation cannot accept a method of deciding on proposals with eleven votes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov clashed at the Peace Conference Rules Committee meeting today. Byrnes accused the Soviet Union of attempting to command the conference through the Four Powers. Molotov replied that the Four Powers was an American concept. Byrnes responded to Molotov's accusation of contradiction by reading out various records, asking Molotov to understand that Byrnes's remarks had been published in the Soviet Union, just as Molotov's remarks had been published in the United States. Molotov then spoke again, reiterating the accusation of contradiction, and saying that Byrnes spoke in a serious and angry tone. The debate today was caused by the issue of whether the conference's motions should be voted on by a two-thirds majority or a simple majority rule.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] An unyielding Byrnes stated here today: Since the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union has been trying to limit the number of countries participating in the Peace Conference to the smallest number possible. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is trying to make the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers (England, America, France and the Soviet Union) control the representatives of the Peace Conference. Bernes delivered a speech at the Peace Conference Rules Committee, responding to Molotov's speech yesterday accusing the United States of supporting Canada's proposal to hold the Council of Foreign Ministers' meeting concurrently with the Peace Conference, saying: "Since the convening of the Peace Conference, I have not said a word to blame the position held by the Soviet representatives, nor have I questioned the motives of the Soviet representatives. However, I was quite surprised to hear Molotov's words yesterday." Afterwards, the Rules Committee met again to discuss the voting procedure that had been the subject of intense debate. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky spoke, asking the representatives to support the two-thirds majority voting rule passed by the Four Powers, saying that Ukraine wants to see a consensus reached through majority votes. If a consensus cannot be reached, it hopes that the greatest majority will pass the resolution, and that a two-thirds majority voting rule best reflects the wishes of the people of the formerly occupied countries. At the same time, a dispute between Czechoslovakia and Poland over the 420-mile area surrounding Teschen in Silesia threatens to create a new territorial issue for the Peace Conference. Polish Foreign Minister Romosky, the head of the country's Peace Conference delegation, told reporters that the area cannot be ceded to Czechoslovakia because of the ethnicity of its people. However, he hoped that the issue could be resolved through a friendly understanding with the Czechoslovak government. The region, with a population of 240,000, has been in dispute for many years. Czechoslovakia has now taken the initiative and has no intention of giving up its "demands".</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Expresses Views: A Two-Thirds Vote Could Cause a Stalemate; China, the U.S. and 13 Other Countries Support the British Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] China's attitude on the issue of voting procedures was clarified by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie at today's Rules Committee meeting. After careful consideration, Foreign Minister Wang declared that the Chinese delegation believes that some revisions to the two-thirds majority system proposed by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers in Paris last month are necessary and appropriate. Wang believes that the two-thirds majority system has its shortcomings because the adoption of this voting system may cause the following stalemate in the discussions of the Peace Conference, which may generate recommendations on the issues in the draft peace treaty. On the other hand, the Chinese delegation does not approve of the simple majority voting system proposed by the Netherlands, as it also has its shortcomings. Based on past experience, we must pay attention to the issue of voting procedures in these international gatherings. If the resolutions of the Peace Conference are produced by a simple majority vote, then the recommendations of this Peace Conference will only receive support from a minority of participating countries. Wang continued that the Chinese delegation intends to propose an amendment that requires the recommendations of the Peace Conference to be decided by an absolute majority vote, that is, a majority vote. However, after studying the British compromise proposal, we believe that the main points of our original proposal have been included in the British proposal, so we will no longer propose another amendment, but are willing to support the British amendment proposal.</p>
<h3>Organize a Subcommittee: Study Amendments; Czech Proposal Ultimately Rejected</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Bureau] Paris, 6th, Broadcast: Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk made a proposal today, advocating the establishment of a subcommittee to study various amendments related to procedural issues, but it was ultimately rejected by a vote of eleven to eight, with two abstentions.</p>

The delegation will be led by Junquetsey, but will not attend the Peace Conference in Paris until it receives a formal invitation.</p>
<h3>Five Powers Rotating Chairmanship: Confirmed by Our Officials</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the issue of the chairmanship of the Paris Peace Conference, there has been much debate in the conference, and various reports have also been inconsistent. A reporter recently inquired with our officials and confirmed that the conference chairmanship has been resolved to be held by the foreign ministers of the Five Powers in rotation.

<h3>Nazi-Looted Gold: Shipped Back to the Hungarian Capital Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Bureau] Jinjiushan, 6th, Broadcast: The U.S. State Department announced today that gold looted from Hungary by the German Nazi Party was recovered in the U.S. occupied area and is now being returned to Hungary to be received by the National Bank of that country. A train carrying the gold, escorted by U.S. and Soviet guards, will arrive in the Hungarian capital today from Frankfurt.</p>
<h3>Finnish Sawmill: Mysterious Fire Cases</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 5th] Since the beginning of summer, there have been several mysterious fires at Finnish sawmills. These timbers are all used as compensation to the Soviet Union, so the Party claims that this is done by Fascists. According to the Finnish Peace Treaty draft, Finland should give the Soviet Union the price of 300 million U.S. dollars in kind. The Finnish government feels that the burden is too heavy, and the fires in the sawmills have caused Finland's economy to suffer significant losses.</p>
<h3>Siam Officially Applies: To Join the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] Siam applied today to join the United Nations organization. This is the eighth country to apply to join since the organization was founded. Siam's application was submitted by Foreign Minister Chiawaham, stating, "My government and people are ready and determined to abide by all the obligations of the United Nations Charter."</p>

It is expected that the number of employees will increase to 2,000 by January next year and will eventually reach 3,000.</p>
<h3>Jewish Organizations: Submit Memorandum to the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The American Jewish Association, the British Jewish Public Council, and the World Jewish Congress jointly submitted a memorandum to the Paris Peace Conference today, demanding that the rights of Jews in the territories of Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania be restored. The memorandum pointed out that the status of Jews in certain regions of the above-mentioned countries is far lower than that of other people, and anti-Semitic sentiments are even more tense. In short, all former enemy countries should guarantee the elimination of all discrimination against Jews, and Jews should restore all pre-war freedoms and property. If there are changes in national borders, Jews should be allowed to choose their own nationality.</p>
<h3>Molotov's Explosive Speech Day Before Yesterday: Contents; Firmly Opposes British and Dutch Amendments; Accuses the U.S. Representative of a Contradictory Attitude</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The Peace Conference Rules Committee continued its meeting. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech, firmly opposing the amendments to the Peace Conference Rules proposed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and strongly criticized the U.S. representative's contradictory attitude, almost causing the Rules Committee to break down. His remarks were roughly as follows: The suggestion made by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Meeting stipulates that any resolution passed by the Peace Conference must obtain the consent of two-thirds of the majority. This suggestion should be accepted, and this kind of conference procedure has been adopted in the San Francisco Conference, and the effect is remarkable. It is difficult to understand why the same success cannot be achieved at this moment.</p>
<p>Any resolution passed with a two-thirds approval can be recognized by the world's democratic countries as having obtained unanimous agreement, so the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Meeting also considered this. As for the amendment proposed by the British representative, which advocates adopting both majority voting and two-thirds majority methods, it is contrary to the resolution of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Meeting, so it cannot be accepted. The representatives of each country have the freedom to express their opinions and defend their views, but they must be consistent from beginning to end. However, it is contradictory to support majority voting today and advocate a two-thirds majority tomorrow. The U.S. representative is suffering from this. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said that the resolutions passed by the Foreign Ministers' Meeting cannot restrict the Peace Conference's right to discuss these resolutions. This is very true. The Peace Conference can also discuss the issues that the Foreign Ministers' Meeting failed to discuss. The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers can freely discuss, but they must uphold the matters that have already been decided. I suggested on the 30th of last month that the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers should hold a meeting during the Peace Conference, and Byrnes expressed his agreement to this, but has suddenly changed his mind at this moment.</p>
<p>The Canadian representative made this suggestion, and the U.S. representative expressed his agreement, but expressed his disagreement when the Soviet representative made it. The French newspaper Le Peuple wrote an article saying that the United Kingdom and the United States seem to prefer the Peace Conference to adopt a majority voting method because this matter is beneficial to the United Kingdom and the United States. This is very true. In the United Nations, if unanimous agreement cannot be obtained, then adopting a majority voting method can be said to be sufficient, but it still cannot force the minority to be convinced. World opinion has not yet been able to understand this attitude, which is regrettable. Currently, there are only nine countries attending the Peace Conference that have been ravaged by the Fascists, namely the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, France, Poland, Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and Yugoslavia. If majority voting is adopted, then the victimized countries will become a minority, so I cannot express my agreement to this. We have not yet decided how to vote on an issue, but we should try to maintain the unity of the United Nations and maintain peace. The best way to maintain peace is to escape the traps set by warmongers. A two-thirds majority can make it easier for us to achieve this goal, but the suggestions passed by majority voting should also be given attention by the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Finally, I advocate that the representatives of each country have the right to make proposals to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.</p>

This treaty can be renegotiated and amended on August 15. Signatory countries wishing to make amendments must notify three months in advance, but no such notification has been issued to date.</p>

<h3>Palestine Partition Plan: Both Arabs and Jews Express Rejection, Dealing a Major Blow to Round Table Conference; Britain Awaits Washington's Declaration of Attitude</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] Regarding the newly drafted plan for Palestine, the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency met this afternoon to discuss the matter and unanimously expressed opposition, stating the following reasons: (1) The British plan neither grants Arab independence nor Jewish independence. The provincial government system, with all its important privileges and even the legislative power of the provinces, is under the jurisdiction of the British High Commissioner in Palestine. The provincial governors are also appointed by the High Commissioner, making this system nothing more than self-deception. (2) According to the British plan, Jews are deprived of 85% of their settlements in Palestine, and they have no control over the colonization of the remaining 15% of the territory. (3) The area of the Jewish autonomous province is smaller than the Jewish state proposed by the Peel Commission in 1937. (4) The British plan does not provide guarantees and has no definitive nature.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency in Paris has decided to reject the partition plan for Palestine as a basis for negotiation. This is seen here as a major blow to the convening of a London round table conference to discuss the Palestine issue. The Arab League has also expressed its rejection of the plan. Therefore, even if the round table conference is held, the Palestine partition plan cannot be submitted for discussion. President Truman has not yet expressed his opinion on the partition plan. Now that both Arabs and Jews have expressed rejection, the US government's attitude is likely to be one of opposition. Political circles predict that when the British Cabinet meets on Wednesday to discuss the entire Palestine issue, a formal response from the US will be presented.</p>
<p>Soviet Criticism of British and American Policy</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Radio Moscow today broadcast in English, vehemently criticizing the British and American plan to partition Palestine, stating that it is bound to fail without the assistance of United Nations agencies. This is the first Soviet commentary on the British and American plan. The radio station also said that the Palestinian people's desire for peaceful independence cannot be satisfied by such a plan. Millions of people are pinning their hopes on the work of the Paris Peace Conference, and they will surely ask themselves whether what is happening in Palestine is consistent with the principles of building lasting peace and ensuring equal rights for all nations. Freedom-loving countries once fought together against the Axis aggressors for these equal rights.</p>
<p>Jewish Underground Party Warns Britain</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 5th] The Jewish radio station "Voice of Israel" has just announced, "Serious events are about to begin." At the same time, the Haganah organization posted notices stating that the third stage of oppression of the Jews of Palestine is about to begin. No male immigrants are allowed to enter Palestinian cities. We must warn Britain that if this measure continues to be implemented, it will cause disorder and bloodshed. All Jews in Palestine, regardless of their status, will unite.</p>
<h3>British and American Embassies in Damascus Attacked with Bombs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beirut, 5th] Two bombs were thrown at the British Consulate and the American Legation here last night, causing significant damage.

<h3>Ten Days After Atomic Bomb Test, Still Potent Radiation</h3>
<p>Commander Blandy First Boards Target Ship</p>
<p>[United Press, Bikini, 5th] Commander Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb tests, boarded a target ship for the first time today after the underwater explosion test on July 25th. He told reporters that eleven days after the underwater atomic bomb explosion, the target ships still have potent radiation, which is a form of poison gas warfare. A reinforced concrete dock sank today, making it the seventeenth target ship to sink. Radiological experts accompanied Blandy on a detailed examination of three ships.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Rats that survived the atomic bomb tests will live out their family lives at the National Cancer Institute. Scientists at the institute are studying whether atomic rays affect their fertility. At the same time, they will also study whether radiation causes cancer in some people and eliminates cancer in others. In addition, they will study possible variations, such as color statistics, and other characteristics of the eyes, ears, and feet. The development of rats is very similar to that of humans.</p>

<h3>International Tribunal Begins Hearing Case of Japanese Aggression in China Proper Yesterday; Powell, Crippled in Both Legs, Continues to Arrive with a Cane; Former Wanping County Magistrate Wang Lengqi Also Attends to Testify</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] After the International Tribunal opened its session on the morning of the 6th, the prosecution first read out the indictment signed by Prosecutor Xiang Zhejunn of China, stating that Japan's aggression against China began with the Shanghai War in 1932 and continued until the end of the war, divided into four periods. The Nanjing Massacre case was given special attention in the indictment. Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhejunn and American Prosecutor Sutton will present detailed accusations against the Japanese for persecuting the Chinese people, especially for the crimes of the Japanese harming the Chinese people with opium and narcotics.</p>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 6th] The Far East International Tribunal has concluded its hearing on the Japanese invasion of Northeast China. Starting today, it began hearing the case of Japan's armed aggression against other parts of China. Prosecutor Morrow made a statement, saying: "The statement I am about to make covers the entire territory of China outside of Northeast China. Using modern land, sea, and air forces, with the aim of conquest and plunder, Japan engaged in a planned military attack and military aggression. The conflict in Northeast China eventually spread to Shanghai. The Japanese attack on Shanghai on January 28, 1932, was a derivative of their invasion of Northeast China. At that time, the Japanese army encountered</p>
<p>The long-term resistance of the 19th Route Army, and a ceasefire agreement was reached on May 5 of the same year. The second invasion was launched five years later, similar to the first invasion, with combat operations beginning in the middle of the night. Initially, Chinese and Japanese troops clashed at the Lugou Bridge on July 7, 1937. The incident quickly developed, and Peiping was attacked and fell to the Japanese army. The Chinese army was forced to retreat westward. On August 13 of the same year, the Japanese army launched a second offensive in Shanghai. A vast expanse of fertile land between Nanjing and Shanghai was devastated by an undeclared war of aggression, leading to its desolation. This battle reached its climax with the Japanese occupation of Nanjing. The citizens of Nanjing were brutally massacred with bayonets and machine guns, creating a horrifying story. Its barbarity and tyranny were unmatched since Attila the Hun. In addition, captured Chinese soldiers were indiscriminately killed. The operations carried out by Generals Matsui and Hata and other generals involved attacking along railway lines and riverbanks. The Chinese coast was blockaded by the Japanese navy. Japanese warships sailed up the Yangtze River to assist the army in its offensive, while Japanese aircraft bombed Chinese cities.</p>
<p>At the height of the war of aggression, 250 million people in eastern China were placed under the control of the Japanese army and navy. Until March 30, 1940, when the Japanese established the puppet Nanjing regime, there were no formal regulations governing the detention and treatment of captured Chinese soldiers. Comparing the statistics of both China and Japan, it can be seen that during this four-year war, the number of Chinese people who died or went missing reached one million. This is the number of people who were captured and killed by the Japanese army. 411,000 people are not included in this number. The total number of dead and wounded was 3,217,940 (according to Chinese statistics). On December 8, 1941, the Japanese army launched a third invasion in Shanghai, entering the former International Settlement to arrest British and Americans and detain them. The crimes committed by Chinese non-combatants during Japan's military aggression against China will be discussed later. All defendants who carried out this military aggression are criminally responsible for the above-mentioned war." After the statement, J. B. Powell, editor of the China Weekly Review, took the witness stand again and answered the direct questions of Prosecutor Morrow, describing the situation of the two Shanghai battles.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the Shanghai War, [Powell] stated: "During the first Shanghai War, I saw many destroyers transporting troops landing in the Hongkou area and aircraft bombing in the Zhabei area. Fierce battles in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Zhabei areas continued until May. This time, the navy initially conducted the operations, and later the army also participated. Armored vehicles were used when occupying the North Station. The army brought tanks and heavy artillery, and the navy fired from cruisers. Japanese officials tried hard to resolve the situation. Shigemitsu, who is here now, was the Consul-General in Shanghai at the time, and he made particular efforts. The Japanese army's second attack on Shanghai was an army operation, landing in Wusong and attacking along the Yangtze River, developing in the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle area. I glimpsed that Suzhou was severely damaged, and twelve villages were completely destroyed. The Japanese army's third invasion of Shanghai occurred almost simultaneously with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The British gunboat HMS Peterel was sunk, the American gunboat USS Wake was captured, and the former International Settlement was occupied by Japanese naval forces." After Powell finished speaking, he was cross-examined by American defense attorney Fan Si: "Before the first invasion of Shanghai, conflicts occurred, and the Shanghai International Settlement was garrisoned by the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, organized by the United States, Britain, Italy, Germany, Japan, and other countries. One of the reasons for the establishment of the corps was the agitation of the 19th Route Army in the suburbs of Shanghai?" (Answer) "Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Route Army, had strong feelings about the Northeast Incident." (Question) "Did the Japanese army enter certain areas after defeating the Chinese army and engage in the invasion of Chinese territory?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Did the fighting stop in early May, and a ceasefire agreement was reached, but did the Japanese side have a sincere intention to cease hostilities as early as early March?" (Answer) "There was such a plan and action." (Question) "Was the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement an agreement to establish a neutral zone? Did the Japanese army indeed withdraw? Did Shigemitsu closely cooperate with the British and American sides?" (Answer) "Yes. Shigemitsu did not have the Japanese army's will to invade and did his best to resolve the incident." Powell then described how General Shirakawa and other Japanese officers were killed by a bomb at the former Hongkou Park (now Zhongzheng Park) during the celebration of the ceasefire agreement by the Japanese, and how Shigemitsu lost a leg. (Question) "Did the witness know that before the first Shanghai Incident, the anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai was very intense, and that the 20,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai were in considerable danger?" (Answer) "That was generally the case. There were 30,000 to 50,000 Japanese people." Powell then answered the questions of Prosecutor Dues, describing the crimes of the former Japanese Kempeitai in Shanghai, stating: "On December 20, 1941, all Shanghai reporters were arrested and taken to the Kempeitai headquarters, which was originally an apartment building, and the underground cell was transformed into an animal cage. I was thrown into that cell. There were 15 rooms in total, each 12 feet high and 18 feet wide. About 40 people were thrown into each room. Because the room was small and there were many people, everyone sat shoulder to shoulder in a row. The prison had not been cleaned since 1937, and the Japanese Kempeitai did not care about this at all. Food was only a small amount of rice three times a day. Except for breakfast, it seemed to have been left for several days and was inedible. In addition, there was a liquid of unknown name once a day. It seemed that someone was sending canned goods to the prison, but they were not given to us. Regarding medical care, there were medics and nurses who visited regularly. However, except for serious illnesses, no treatment was given. When I entered the prison, I weighed 145 pounds, and when I left, I weighed 70 pounds. Most people suffered from malnutrition. Guards used wooden boards for packing goods to beat the Chinese people up to 85 times. When violating prison rules, they would make people kneel in the Japanese style, facing Tokyo to worship, to show apology to the Japanese Emperor. We were forced to write letters falsely claiming to be healthy and were later sent to the former Jiangwan Prison. The food was slightly improved, but because of sitting on the ground for a long time, sores developed on our buttocks, and our feet swelled and turned black. Later, due to the aggravation of the disease, I underwent surgery in the hospital and had both feet amputated." After Powell finished his testimony, he left the court with a cane. Next, Wang Lengqi, the magistrate of Wanping County at the time of the Lugou Bridge Incident, testified, and the prosecutor read out his testimony, stating: "After the Japanese army occupied Fengtai, they controlled the transportation between Peiping and Tianjin, cut off the north from the central government,</p>
<p>Made North China a special sphere of influence, and planned to use the habitual tricks of invading Northeast China, wanting to occupy North China without losing a single soldier, so they began the so-called peaceful invasion. The Japanese side had previously obtained the cooperation of Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and used the name of railway operation to survey the area between Fengtai and Lugou Bridge. Later, the Japanese side wanted to lease or buy the area to build barracks and airports, but both were rejected by our side. The Japanese side then knew that a peaceful invasion was impossible and that an armed invasion must be carried out, thus opening the beginning of the Lugou Bridge Incident."</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of CNRRA's Work Scope Emphasizes Three Aspects; Investigation of Storage Warehouses in Various Locations Began Yesterday, Actively Clearing Accumulated Goods</h3>
<p>The joint investigation of CNRRA by the Administrative and Supervisory Yuans has lasted for twelve days. It is learned that the scope of the investigation emphasizes three points: (1) the funding of CNRRA and the situation of its expenditure, (2) the cooperation between CNRRA and UNRRA and their contact, (3) the work situation of various departments of CNRRA, etc. In addition to specially assigning Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang, Du Jianxun, auditors Wang Qichang, Qian Jimin, etc., to come to Shanghai to conduct an investigation together with Supervisory Commissioner Cheng, the Executive Yuan also sent Yin Zhongrong, Xue Quan, and Xia Pingfang to Shanghai to consult with Gu and Du and others on the method of conducting a joint investigation. Gu and the other seven people have a temporary office in the CNRRA office. They arrive at CNRRA at 9 am every morning to investigate each department separately and summon the responsible personnel for inquiries. It has been twelve days now. Yesterday, Gu and others also began to investigate the various storage warehouses of CNRRA in the Hongkou District. They inspected the warehouses from morning to noon, and they will continue to inspect the warehouses tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. They also plan to submit a report to the Supervisory Yuan. The CNRRA side is unwilling to express any opinions on this investigation work of the Supervisory Yuan and said that the findings of the investigation will be announced by the Supervisory Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>According to Supervisory Commissioner Cheng, the investigation of CNRRA, except for financial matters, the investigation work of other departments can be completed within a week. However, the audit of financial matters will take time due to the large number of books. Therefore, it is still difficult to complete in a short period of time. As for the results of the investigation of CNRRA, they will be reported to the Supervisory Yuan. The Supervisory Commissioner's Office does not intend to make any announcements.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Since UNRRA announced the suspension of transportation to China, all parties have paid close attention to this. The reporter specifically visited the CNRRA spokesperson yesterday and asked about the issue of resuming transportation. He said: "Regarding when UNRRA will resume transportation to China, we have not yet received any notification from UNRRA." The materials currently accumulated in the warehouses in Shanghai are all heavy machinery. The bureau has ordered storage and transportation personnel and machine assembly plants to work 24 hours a day in order to clear the accumulated goods in the warehouses as soon as possible. Most of these heavy machinery are surplus old military machinery purchased by UNRRA from the South Pacific, and they must be assembled before they can be transported to the interior. Sometimes it is found that the machinery is missing major parts, and they must be assembled. Transporting machinery from the Shanghai docks to the bureau's machine assembly plant at Zhenru Jinan University is a difficult task. For example, a large mining machine cannot move on its own and must be dragged into the factory.</p>
<p>Improving Transportation and Ordering New Methods</p>
<p>When asked about the past transportation situation, the spokesperson said: "Our bureau has always handled transportation work under extremely difficult technical conditions. In the past, UNRRA cargo ships to China did not notify our bureau of the ship schedule and cargo name in advance, so there was no way to prepare in advance. Now our bureau has requested UNRRA Director La Guardia to improve its procedures. The two sides have now agreed on new methods: (1) UNRRA agrees to notify our bureau's office in Washington in advance with ship cargo documents and cargo lists. (2) All UNRRA materials transported to China must be transferred to CNRRA in full in accordance with the basic agreement signed by the Chinese government and UNRRA. The two sides will hand over the goods at the side of the ship and shall not delay. (3) UNRRA canned food, transportation equipment, and machinery transported to China should be inspected in advance when they are loaded for export, and UNRRA will guarantee to our bureau that all items are in good condition, so as to avoid materials being stored in the warehouse because they cannot be used after arriving in China, making them difficult to handle. If the above-mentioned improvement methods are implemented, the difficulties in handling UNRRA materials by our bureau in the future can be expected to be reduced. In addition, in order to avoid materials being completely concentrated in Shanghai, UNRRA has agreed to consider using smaller sea vessels to transport goods to China, so that they can dock and unload cargo in smaller ports in the inland sea and rivers, in order to transfer them to the interior.</p>

<h3>Inspection Ceremony Held Yesterday at Refugee and Orphan Reception Center; Orderly and Spirited; Mayor Praised Extensively in Speech</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Under the umbrella-like scorching sun, cars traveling between Shanghai and Caohejing continued to arrive. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director Li Jianhua, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee Wu Shaoshu, philanthropists Dong Hefu, Zhu Xuefan, and UNRRA's Pride, all rushed to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Refugee and Orphan Reception Center to participate in their grand inspection ceremony.</p>
<p>The former hooligans, pickpockets, beggars, street children, and vagrants who roamed the streets are now wearing uniform uniforms and lined up neatly on the square. When Mayor Wu and others ascended the review stand, six female refugee children sent by the US military presented flowers first, and then the team began the inspection. From beginning to end, the order was good and the steps were neat. I have seen this inspection twice now, but I have been brought to tears each time! Seeing them, I can't help but feel some sorrow. Why were they born without parents? And so they drifted! Roamed!</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said: "Today is the happiest day since I came to Shanghai. I was saddened by the decline of social morality in Shanghai, but that sadness no longer exists after coming here. I must first congratulate you all for jumping from roaming the streets to becoming the most useful people. Second, I want to congratulate the Republic of China. In the past, you had no concept of the country, but today, you have become the people who love the country the most. Now that you have come here, the government will definitely support you and cultivate you. I hope that under the leadership of Director Zhou, you will always move forward!"</p>
<p>Responding to Mayor Wu was thunderous applause and loud slogans: Long live the Republic of China, Long live President Chiang!</p>
<p>Overture, music, flower presentation, flag-raising ceremony, inspection, swearing-in, awards, cheers, human pyramid, calisthenics... Under the hot sun, the endless wonderful programs left every guest stunned. Everyone was wondering: are these the criminals of the past? Those annoying and hateful bugs?</p>
<p>Just as Director Zhou Zuwang said: "Ten months ago, if this group of people were put into society, I don't know how many police would be needed to suppress them, but now they have all learned self-government, distinguish right from wrong, and have become the productive stage of society."</p>
<p>How do they live in the institute? —Division of labor and cooperation, mutual assistance, work-study combination, equal emphasis on education and upbringing. Regarding all the organizations in the institute, the reporter has already provided a detailed introduction in the newspaper on the 2nd of this month, so there is naturally no need to repeat it. In short, this is their home. In the institute, they have found strict fathers and friends, sympathy and warmth! In the life of unity, they forgot themselves, and in the concept of "group," they will never be alone again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Film Studio has turned their activities into a movie, hoping that its public release will arouse people's sympathy and provide spiritual and material assistance, because the institute's funding is very difficult, and the society must help to make this meaningful work continue. And to achieve that there is no wandering waste in society, the father of the country called the "Great Harmony World not picking up what was dropped on the road and locking doors at night", the starting point is in this.</p>

<h3>Domestic Postage Increases Fourfold; Post Office Headquarters is Petitioning</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Wang Yuguang, Director of Postal Affairs, Post Office Headquarters, yesterday, the Post Office has submitted a petition to the Legislative Yuan to increase domestic postage fourfold in order to make up for the huge monthly deficit of 4 billion yuan. It is said that the proposal to increase postage fourfold was made two months ago, and now prices have risen nearly ninefold. Last month, the National Government was only able to make up for a portion of the postage deficit, forcing the bureau to borrow from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to balance its income and expenditure. The total amount of loans from the Post Office Headquarters to the bureau has accumulated to nearly 20 billion yuan. According to Deputy Director Wang's explanation, the reason for the huge monthly postage deficit is the rapid rise in prices. Today's postage is only 400 times that of 1936, while prices have risen 5,000 to 10,000 times during the same period. Wang also pointed out that the Post Office certainly cannot rely on government subsidies every month to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Wearing Old Cotton-Padded Clothes to Visit the Cold Storage Room; Minus 25 Degrees Celsius Feels Like Entering the Arctic Circle</h3>
<p>In the summer life of the city, ice is an indispensable necessity. It is estimated that in the hottest weather, the daily demand for machine-made ice in Shanghai is about 600 tons, and usually about 400 tons. The current ex-factory price of machine-made ice is 60,000 yuan per ton, which means that Shanghai people spend 20 to 30 million yuan on ice every day.</p>
<p>The main business of ice factories is still cold storage. At present, there are seven Chinese cold storage companies and five foreign cold storage companies in Shanghai, as well as several enemy properties that have been taken over. The reporter recently visited Maochang Cold Storage Company, the largest Chinese company with more than 20 years of history.</p>
<p>Making machine-made ice is in a rectangular pool containing salt water, divided into more than a dozen long grooves, and equipped with a dozen ammonia pipes. Filtered water is placed in specially made rectangular iron boxes, and then the boxes are placed in the grooves one by one, covered with wooden boards. Ammonia absorbs the heat, and salt water also plays a part in assisting. After 36 hours, the filtered water in the iron box freezes into pieces of clean white ice.</p>
<p>The ammonia cooler is on the fifth floor, with tap water dripping and dripping on the winding iron pipes. Ammonia is pressed out of the machine, passes through the cold storage room and the ice-making room, and the heat absorbed is cooled here. This back-and-forth cycle, if there is no air leakage or other losses, can simply be used endlessly.</p>
<p>Walking into the first cold storage room, I put on a thick old cotton-padded jacket, but my feet still felt frozen to the bone. This is not the coldest, the temperature is between 32 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit, the so-called ChillRoom by foreigners, which contains seafood, northern goods, fruits, western medicine, etc., and there are only twelve ammonia pipes on the ceiling.</p>
<p>The Freeze Room for milk powder, ice cream, etc. is so cold that people think they have arrived in the Arctic. Although the aroma is pungent, the temperature is about 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and there are 24 pipes on the ceiling. Going to the room where yellow croaker and cuttlefish are placed becomes more and more severe, and there are as many as 100 ammonia pipes. On the one hand, it is quite unbearable due to the cold, and on the other hand, the salty smell is really uncomfortable, so I retreated after a brief look.</p>
<p>But the coldest is the quick-freezing room, where the temperature is minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of the fresh goods must be frozen in this room before being stored.</p>
<p>When I went out, I saw a restaurant sending two baskets of spring chicken to be stored. This tells you a secret, why you can eat fresh goods at any time of the year. Shanghai's restaurants and cold storage companies can really be said to be interdependent and inseparable "wrongdoers"! (Fanshi)</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways Select Combined Freight and Passenger Transport Stations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to facilitate the flow of materials and the convenience of passengers, the Ministry of Transportation has successively tested combined freight and passenger transport on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways. The package transport stations are temporarily selected as: Tianjin-Pukou Railway: Xuzhou, Suxian, Guzhen, Bengbu, and Bengb埠头, Linhuaiguan, Mingguang, Pukou. Beijing-Shanghai Railway: Nanxingqiao, Rihui Port, Maigen Road, Wuxi, Nanjing, Shanghai North Station and other 15 stations. Among them, Pukou and Nanjing stations only handle arrivals and do not handle departure business. The passenger luggage transport stations are temporarily set at four places: Xuzhou, Bengbu, Hangzhou City Station, and Shanghai North Station.

<h3>Zhejiang Associations in Shanghai Plead with the Government to Exempt from Grain Requisition</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang native Associations in Shanghai recently held a joint meeting. In order to appeal for the cessation of land tax requisition, they telegraphed Chairman Chiang, President Song, President Sun, etc. The original telegram roughly stated: Last year, the government ordered the exemption of land tax for one year, and it was a joyful sound. Today, land tax must be requisitioned in kind. Each yuan of the old tax is combined with the levy of borrowing and public grain must be levied more than five dou and four liters of rice. Based on the current rice price of 50,000 legal currency per stone, it has increased to tens of thousands of times. The magnitude of the increase is shocking. How can the poor and weak bear this? The 25% rent reduction has been implemented for a long time. The actual rice rent received by the landlords is less than four dou per mu. According to the current levy rate, the tax is heavy, and each county must pay more than seven dou of grain per mu. The landlords cannot afford to pay, and they will inevitably increase the rent from the tenant farmers. The fertile land is only about three stones of grain for a good harvest, and the barren land is two or three stones. In ancient times, it was called taking one-tenth, but now it is taken to one-fourth or one-third. As a result, both industry and tenant farmers will be exhausted, and the society will not be peaceful. In fact, it is difficult to implement.</p>

<h3>Dance Hostesses Active; Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Police Bureau has stipulated that dance halls are not allowed to hire dance hostesses, and has summoned the responsible persons of each dance hall to the bureau to inform them to comply. However, most dance halls superficially obey but secretly violate the rules, and dance hostesses are still active. Recently, due to sluggish business, they have even resorted to forcibly "pulling up stages," causing unclear disputes with dancers, and intensifying the exploitation of dance girls. The Administrative Department of the Police Bureau has decided to strictly prohibit them for violating the law and has ordered all subordinate branches to implement it.</p>
<h3>Restaurants and Western Restaurants Scheduled to Hold Charity Sales to Help Disaster Relief</h3>

<h3>Deputy Director Hu Discusses Business License Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The reporter recently interviewed Deputy Director Hu of the Finance Bureau and asked about the bureau's collection of business license tax. He said: The bureau's collection of business license tax is based on the regulations of the central government, and 38 types of industries, such as jewelry, are taxed at a rate of 5 per thousand of their declared capital amount each year. Business licenses are also renewed once a year. Since the opening in mid-May, a total of more than 7,000 businesses have gone to apply for procedures, and more than 6,000 business licenses have been issued so far. The difficulty at present is that some businesses were established before the war, and the amount of capital is very small, which is inconsistent with the actual situation. It would be unreasonable to tax according to this. Moreover, some industries are unable to adjust their capital amount for a while, or have not yet joined the industry association. In such cases, the bureau can only temporarily tax according to the old license fee ratio. At the same time, the bureau sincerely hopes that all industries can automatically adjust their capital amount, so that it can be taxed according to the regulations after being approved. In addition, since accepting the business license matters, the bureau has drafted a kind of business license linkage method. The purpose is to make the review work of each industry still performed separately by the relevant bureaus. For example, the police and health bureaus are also responsible for reviewing and issuing licenses for the barber and bathroom industries within their jurisdiction. In order to unify the license issuance steps, it is proposed that after separate reviews, the Finance Bureau will issue the licenses in a centralized manner. The principle of this method has been decided. As for the technical and detailed regulations, it will be passed and implemented after the Municipal Government Counselor's Office convenes a meeting of the bureaus.</p>

<h3>During the Enemy Puppet Period Murder of Husband Case Accused Woman Zhan Zhou Questioned by High Court Yesterday Story Is Long Past Is Too Painful To Recall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhan Zhou (pictured), the perpetrator of the sensational murder of her husband during the enemy-puppet period in Shanghai, was sentenced to death by the then-puppet court, and her appeal was rejected. But before the sentence could be carried out, victory arrived, and the puppet court's judgment was declared invalid. The case was then retried. Zhan Zhou is currently detained in the North Zhejiang Road Detention Center. Yesterday morning, the High Procuratorate dispatched bailiffs to escort her, arriving at the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 11:30 AM. The prosecutor opened an interrogation court to question her, finishing around 12:00 PM, and she was then transferred to the women's prison in Shanghai Prison.</p>
<p>Sentenced to Death after High Court Trial</p>
<p>Zhan Zhou is currently 31 years old, from Danyang. She formerly resided at No. 85, rear building, Lane 432, Yiyuan Lane, Xinchang Road, in this city. Her husband, Zhan Yunying, from Anhui, was a second-hand goods dealer. On the morning of March 20 last year, Zhan Zhou, taking advantage of her husband's sleep, used a kitchen knife to violently hack at his head, neck, lower legs, thighs, upper legs, and lower limbs. Afterward, she dismembered the body into more than ten pieces, placed them in a suitcase, and attempted to destroy the evidence. However, she was discovered by the sub-landlord Wang Xieyang, who reported her to the police and had her arrested. Subsequently, He Damaizi, Xiao Ningbo, and others were implicated as suspected accomplices in adultery, but after the trial by the then-puppet court, the two suspects were found not guilty, while Zhan Zhou was ultimately sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Recalling the Past, Husband Was Not Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhan Zhou wore an old blue short-sleeved cheongsam made of coarse cloth, bare feet in gray striped cloth shoes. Her hair was combed back into two braids, and she held a red plaid handkerchief. The collar was unbuttoned due to the heat, and she was short in stature. After being escorted from the detention center to the Shanghai Prison, after removing the handcuffs, she began by saying "it's a long story" and told the reporter: She was engaged at the age of seventeen and married at the age of twenty-one. Her husband was always out eating, drinking, gambling, and doing whatever he pleased, rarely returning home. When she tried to reason with him, she was beaten and cursed. He also had an affair with a maid outside, who became pregnant, and she took care of it for him. When he was unemployed, they relied entirely on her earnings to make a living. He never knew how to turn back, abandoning his family and continuing to gamble outside, selling off all the furniture.</p>
<p>Describing the Chopping as If Encountering a Ghost</p>
<p>On the night of March 19 last year, he returned home from outside, and they had another argument before going to sleep. Deep into the night, she suddenly woke up with a start. After relieving herself, she took a kitchen knife from the cabinet next to the toilet and hacked violently at the bed. At the time, she only knew that she was chopping at ordinary things, and she didn't know how many times she had chopped. Afterward, it was as if someone was saying in her ear to cut him up, so she did as she was told. It wasn't until she was arrested by the police that she realized what she had done. Now that she thinks about it, she doesn't know how she could have done such a thing. It was truly as if she was possessed by a ghost.</p>
<p>Hearing of Retrial, She Repeatedly Said Thank You</p>
<p>She then told the reporter that while she was in the North Zhejiang Road Detention Center, she was detained with Yuan Meiyun, Wang Guoying, and others, working in the workshop every day, which seemed quite satisfactory. Therefore, when she heard the prosecutor's order to transfer her to the Shanghai Prison yesterday, she asked to do a good deed and asked if she could return to the North Zhejiang Road Detention Center. The bailiff told her that the facilities in the Shanghai Prison women's prison were much better than there, so she stopped saying more. When she heard that the original death sentence had been overturned and there would be a retrial, she smiled and repeatedly said thank you.</p>
<p>The case is now awaiting the High Procuratorate's completion of the investigation and prosecution, after which the High Court can hold a public trial.</p>

After the diver entered the pool, he did not float up for a long time. When people noticed, they swam over to investigate and saw Kang sinking to the bottom of the pool. They immediately jumped into the water and pulled him up, but he had already drowned. It was later discovered that he had a head injury and was bleeding. According to observations by fellow swimmers, it is believed that when Kang dived into the pool, his head hit the bottom of the pool, causing the injury and death.</p>

The lyrics are as follows: "More than nine years since we parted from Lushan, its vastness and magnificence are as before. A joyful life and gathering, academic freedom and lectures. Remember the spirit of the Lotus Society and the Deer Cave Rules, the spirit of the Sea Society training, and the meaning of the Gu Town revival. The famous mountain meets, comforting the hardships of eight years of resistance, advancing in virtue and cultivating learning, establishing the foundation for future national construction." Also, Dr. Hu Guangsu gave his first public lecture in the main hall, titled "Analysis of International Politics," which was attended by all members. The conference plans to take advantage of the presence of famous people on the mountain to temporarily invite them to give lectures.

It is also heard that the conference will respectfully invite Chairman Jiang to give a speech, and a list of lecturers and members is being prepared for review. Cheng Bolu, in the midst of his busy conference affairs, was inspired to write poetry by the famous mountain meeting. He composed a seven-character poem in the style of old verse entitled "Mountain Night": "The first cry of resistance was called out, the Lushan history page is most glorious. The moon rises, and the peaks dawn, the old wind comes and the ravines cry, the great road is truly poor, the guest is uniquely good, this body is old, and the official is light, in the middle of the night, I rise to sit and look at the stars, when will the silver river wash the armor?"</p>

<h3>Songjiang County Temporary Council Asks to Withdraw Xin Zhuang Organization; Municipal Government Replies That It Is Not Feasible</h3>

<h3>Preferential Treatment for Conscripts' Families; Handled as Usual; Districts Without Grain Reserves May Raise Funds Instead</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan ordered the Municipal Government yesterday: After investigating the preferential treatment for the families of soldiers enlisted to resist the enemy, it should continue to be handled until the enlisted recruits are officially discharged by order. Now, in order to enable all anti-[blank] to obtain practical benefits, and to alleviate the difficulties of local governments in raising grain for preferential treatment, the following five items are stipulated: (1) The preferential treatment for the families of all enlisted recruits should continue to be handled as usual until they are discharged. (2) Those counties (cities) that previously allocated grain from grain reserves to provide for the conscripts' families will continue to provide preferential grain as before. (3) Those counties (cities) that no longer have grain reserves available for allocation should raise funds instead of issuing grain. The amount of funds to be raised should be calculated based on the standard of two shi of yellow grain (wheat) per year for each poverty-stricken conscript's family and each self-sufficient conscript's family, and converted into the corresponding price. (4) Areas that have not established grain reserves at all, or that have grain reserves that cannot be used for other purposes, should still raise funds instead of issuing grain. The amount of funds to be raised should be calculated and priced in accordance with the standard of the previous article. (5) The fundraising methods may be based on the spirit of each province's past practices in raising, managing, and distributing settlement fees for enlisted recruits on their own. The provincial government will formulate a general outline, and each county will formulate detailed implementation rules, submit them to the provincial government for record, and then the provincial government will [blank] actually verify and write off the expenses.</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers on the Household Registration Law (Continued)</h3>
<p>(30) Question: In a certain township, a resident named Jia originally has his household registration in Village B and has a spouse. Later, he becomes an adopted son-in-law in Village C and establishes a separate household registration. In this case, one person has two residences in the same jurisdiction, which has the disadvantage of duplication in household registration and statistics. How should this be handled, and where should his rights and obligations belong?</p>
<p>Answer: Article 1002 of the Civil Code stipulates that "an adopted husband-in-law takes the wife's original residence as his own." Therefore, Jia's rights and obligations related to his domicile should be based on his wife's domicile. However, since Jia has a spouse, according to Article 985 of the Civil Code, "a person with a spouse may not commit bigamy." Therefore, his becoming an adopted son-in-law has no legal effect at all, and the establishment of a separate household registration is also without legal basis. For statistical purposes, only Jia's registration in Village B should be used as the basis for exercising his rights and obligations.</p>
<h3>Brief News from Various Districts</h3>
<p>The Twelfth District Office previously approved a letter from Shao Yongsheng, the people's representative of the third bao of the district, stating that he was elected as the district's people's representative, and was subsequently elected as an alternate municipal councilor. Now, because the councilor Weng Jianguang has passed away and a vacancy has been created, Yongsheng should legally fill the vacancy, and the district people's representative vacancy left by the succession, should be filled by the alternate elected Wang Qingsun. Please investigate and handle it accordingly. The district office reported the matter to the Municipal Government, which ordered that the case of Shao Yongsheng filling the councilor vacancy left by Weng Jianguang has been submitted to the Ministry of the Interior for review, and should be awaited for further orders. The district people's representative vacancy left by Shao Yongsheng is approved to be filled by Wang Qingsun.</p>
<p>The Eighteenth District Office of this city held a routine meeting for bao chiefs in the district's auditorium at 2:00 PM on the 1st, which was presided over by Deputy District Chief Chang. He listened to the work reports of the bao chiefs on the spot and gave instructions to them separately.</p>
<h3>Answering Mr. Shen's Questions</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department recently replied to Mr. Shen: (1) In order to facilitate the people in areas where land registration has not been announced to purchase real estate deeds, the Land Administration Bureau has established a method to entrust the district offices to sell them on its behalf. As to whether the deed needs to be certified by the bao chief, and only after the district office registers it can it be established, please inquire directly with the Land Administration Bureau. (2) The Civil Affairs Department did not issue "Jia" badges.</p>

Fortunately, the customers do not have large sales, and if they do, it is difficult to cope with them, according to sources with good information, the stores that used to also wholesale dare not do it now, the reason is that the proceeds from following the correct procedures are not enough to report the business tax, so they would rather give up, and said that the Changzhou raw cloth currently in circulation comes from individual carriers, the buying and selling procedures are extremely simple, and the taxes are very light, in addition, various emerging brands have lower expenses, and often the shopkeepers run the field themselves, and the sales commissions are waived, with such economy, they can make small profits and sell a lot, which cannot be matched by official old brands, according to news from the Cotton Cloth Association, the market set up by the association is seeing weak business, and for the industry colleagues without official brands, it is urgent to provide assistance, and the board of directors has decided to add two hundred market certificates, which shows the weakness of the cloth industry's foundation.</p>

Yishun rose from 8100 yuan to 8400 yuan, other stocks had some differences, but because of the time, it was not universal. The result was that Yishun, Hede[blank], Steel Industry, Yiyi, and British Union each rose by about half a percent compared to the previous close, while the rest still saw some setbacks.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Lifeless</h3>
<p>Except for Type E, public debt is lifeless, Unfied type C opened at 680 yuan, saw a low of 660 yuan in the middle, and finally, because Unified type E had two large orders in the seven building slightly receiving, since seeing 600 yuan rose to about 650 yuan of assistance, slightly rebounded to end around 680 yuan, compared with the previous close, Type A and B were flat, Type C was slightly ten yuan, Type D was thirty yuan, Unified E has the most distant repayment period, someone moved, uniquely rose fifty yuan.</p>

<h3>Intestine Casings: Cost 1.5 Million, Selling Price 1.4 Million</h3>
<p>The export of intestine casings from this city is facing difficulties in large-scale shipment due to the scarcity of vessels heading to New York and Europe. Currently, the cost of producing processed casings from fresh intestines in Shanghai is 1.45 million yuan per barrel. Based on foreign market prices, there is no profit to be made. The industry can barely sustain the livelihoods of workers. Furthermore, according to industry insiders, a recent newspaper article stated the price of fresh intestines at 1.8 million yuan, which is likely a mistake. The market price of ordinary fresh intestines is equivalent to one-quarter of the price of fresh meat, which is 1.25 million yuan per barrel. Adding processing costs of 250,000 yuan, the total cost is 1.5 million yuan. However, the recent American buying price is US$0.55 per piece, which is less than 1.4 million yuan per barrel. If fresh intestines cost as much as 1.8 million yuan, the domestic finished products would cost over 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market: Steady Supply, Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South rice markets in the city received a total of over 7,000 *shi* (a unit of dry measure) of rice. The market activity remained stagnant. Fresh rice saw some trading, but medium- and low-grade rice and old stock were difficult to sell, and the situation remained unlikely to improve. High-quality japonica and indica rice continued to decline by more than one yuan, but supplies priced at 100 yuan were scarce, so the price temporarily remained stable. A small amount of newly harvested japonica rice from Pudong was sold for porridge-making. The price of glutinous rice, after several days of sharp decline, showed signs of stabilizing. Wheat flour continued to decline by 100 to 200 yuan due to continued arrivals from Wuxi. Small wheat farmers still picked high prices and took only small quantities. The market softened, and the price fell by 200 to 300 yuan. Although the Ningbo merchants were buying, the demand was not strong, and the supply still exceeded demand. The future trend was still favorable. Northern merchants only picked white wheat, so the transaction was quite few. New supplies of soybeans gradually increased, and sales were sluggish. The price continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Old stocks were also reduced by 1,000 yuan because the oil factories were not buying well. Broad beans dropped by 1,000 yuan, sesame seeds fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and peanut kernels were selling poorly, continuing to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Due to the hot weather, the vegetable oil market saw an increase in sales and improved buying interest. Supplies from Beidao arrived but were not in high demand. Raw oil rebounded by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil from Shenchang continued to supply. Arrivals from Changzhou and Wuxi also existed. The price trend seemed the same. Soybean cakes sold quite well in rural areas, but autumn will be soon, the application of fertilizer also followed the season, so the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The imported rice that this city ordered from Vietnam is arriving at the port in a steady stream. It is estimated that there are 250,000 bags, totaling 25,000 tons. There is still a large amount of Vietnamese rice on the way to Shanghai. The municipal government has decided to sell this imported rice at a subsidized price. All government agencies, public school teachers, company and factory employees in the city can apply for a purchase quota with official documentation. The detailed regulations are currently being drafted by the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. It is heard that the quantity and price have been decided in principle, admitting two *dou* (a unit of dry measure) per month and half for children. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Qimei* ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying more than 5,950 bags of white rice from Wuhu. Now docked at the South Huangpu No. 10 and 11 pontoons to unload.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Also Shows Contraction: The Main Reason Is Too High Costs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Today's Shanghai shipping industry is shrinking due to the decline in industry and commerce and the weak purchasing power of various regions. Whether it is the shipping industry to various ports along the Yangtze River or the shipping industry operating on inland rivers, they are no longer as prosperous as before. Without government assistance, it is feared that they will follow in the footsteps of general industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been the most important port of import and export in the country. Native products and raw materials from the interior are concentrated here and transshipped to various ports or exported. Foreign goods from abroad are also transported to the interior from here. The main means of transportation that connect them are the following, in addition to the railway: (1) Ships sailing between ports along the Yangtze River, (2) So-called inland river ships sailing on the Suzhou River and canals, (3) Wooden junks, (4) Motorized junks.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses During the War, Ships Still Have No Cargo</p>
<p>According to qualified shipping industry insiders, before the war, there were about 500,000 ships operating on the Yangtze River ports and along the coast. Their routes included Nanjing, Yunnan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Wenzhou, and Ningbo ports. After the ravages of war, some sank in the river, and some ran to the upper reaches of Yichang and Chongqing, with no news. The total amount of losses is estimated to be more than 300,000 tons. Today, no more than 200,000 tons remain after the disaster. The size of the ships varies from 30 to 400 tons. It is claimed that the number of seats has been sharply reduced, and there is still a "ships with no cargo" phenomenon. Each ship that sails is unable to load fully. And ships sailing downstream from Hankou even return empty. Therefore, current business relies mostly on loading military supplies and relief materials for support. The ratio of commercial goods to military and public transportation is about 1.5 to 3.5. However, because the water freight for military and public transportation is only 60% of the freight for commercial goods, and the price of coal is high, it is almost impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>The Shen-Xi Line is Busier, Other Lines Are Desolate, Next let's talk about inland river ships. Before the war, the main routes were Wuxi, Changshu, Pinghu, Huzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Minhang, Qingpu Zhujiajiao and other lines. Among them, the Shen-Xi line was the busiest, with more than 30 ships. Other routes also had three or four ships each, totaling no less than 50 ships. After the war, it also suffered significant losses. Except for the 32 inland river ships that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received from the Japanese, the commercial capital companies such as Xie Xing and Lao Gong Mao could not have one or two small steamers of their own. The routes that have now resumed operation include the Shen-Su-Xi line, the Huzhou line, the Pinghu line, the Changshu line, and the Hangzhou line. The goods transported from various places to Shanghai are mostly rice, wheat, and grains, while the goods transported from Shanghai are diesel, cotton, and foreign groceries.</p>
<p>Wages Are Too High, and the Journey Is Too Slow</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, the biggest obstacle to inland river shipping is the ever-increasing wages of sailors. At the same time, due to the lack of tugboats and expensive rental fees, it is already difficult to barely maintain. Moreover, each shipping company has a fixed schedule. Once there are fewer goods, the sailing costs cannot be reduced, which is the main reason for the losses. Taking a 60-ton tugboat (i.e., wooden barge) as an example, the rental fee plus the wages of the boatmen in the autumn of last year was about 250,000 yuan per month. Today, it has risen to 2.35 million yuan per month. Although the freight rate has increased by 30% to 40% in the past three or four months, it is still felt that it is not worth the loss.</p>
<p>Another difficulty for inland river ships is the recent instability of water transportation security. All trips are now overnight, so the journey that originally took only two days and one night has now been extended to more than four days. At the same time, due to the high price of coal, most companies employ diesel ships. Because their machinery is old and slow, extending the sailing time also indirectly increases costs.</p>
<p>Can't Compete with Wooden Junks, Motorized Junks Decline</p>
<p>Competition for inland river ships is also increasing, that is, wooden junks. The current water freight rates are as follows: diesel is 4,000 yuan per barrel, cotton (400 *jin* per bale) is about 7,000 yuan, rice is 2,000 yuan per *shi*, and wheat is 90% of this price. This price is originally about 40% lower than railway transportation, and the wooden junks' water freight is 40% cheaper. The time spent on the way is almost equal. The reason is that the expenses of the wooden junks are lower. Recently, there are nearly 200 wooden junks (boats) from Jiangbei seeking refuge in Shanghai. Each can carry 50 to 60 tons. Under the competition of this type of boat, there is an increasing phenomenon of "many boats and few goods".</p>
<p>As for the motorized junks that once dominated the sea because of the lack of ships at the beginning of the takeover, although there are still nearly 100 ships, they are now gradually declining because they cannot compete with large ships.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market: Very Few Transactions, Spot Cotton Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market initially rose due to the rise in American cotton. Double Horse brand once rose to 1.35 million, Guangdong merchants folded their arms to wait and see, and merchants intended to sell, so the price returned to 1.325 million. At the end of the market, although the prices of small and medium-sized yarns were shouting up by 10,000 to 20,000, the sales were extremely stagnant, and there were very few transactions. People's minds were no longer as cheerful as the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph frequently rose 47 to 64 points, and it is estimated that the recent US dollar is 34.45, the new cotton forward is 31.73, the middling spot is 35.25, and the local spot cotton market is still firm, and the transaction is not lonely. Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 factories each purchased 300 to 400 bales of white Luo cotton, and the price continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>There is a slight need for grey cloth from all parties, and the base is tighter. Other piece goods sales are still deserted. As a result, it rose 250 yuan to 500 yuan. At noon, textile mills opened for sale as usual, but the market remained unchanged from the previous period. In the afternoon, the market situation went down.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rises Again: Factory Silk and Silk Goods Are Both Sluggish</h3>
<p>Silk fabrics have been dull recently, but artificial silk has been rising day by day. Yesterday, it saw another high of 20,000 yuan. No. 120 Tianqiao bright spot stock was sold at 1.51 million yuan at the close. First the deal did pass 1.5 million yuan. Other brands of semi-bright, except for No. 120, no one cares. In addition to shouting on the original price of the previous day, the rest made 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, more than ten boxes were traded in the market, and No. 120 miscellaneous brands with bright were in the majority. Factory silk did not hear of any transaction throughout the day. More than ten packages of open-mouthed warp were transacted due to price shortage. Ordinary mutual responsibility goods are priced between 1.3 million and 1.32 million yuan. Meiya quilt cover remained the same as the day before, Dacheng check crepe still had no transaction, and electricity spinning and Hua Jin crepe and other were no ups and downs.</p>
<h3>New York's Sino-Japanese Silk Market: Japanese Silk Plans to Drop to $3.50: Quality Exceeds 83 Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The report from the Associated Press in New York on the 2nd stated that American silk merchants have begun to compete with Chinese and Japanese raw silk. It also said that Chinese raw silk is only selling for US$8.50 per pound in the open market, while Japanese raw silk is reaching a maximum price of US$16.50. The reporter asked a person in charge of the China Silk Company about this news. He said that the report on the price may not be entirely accurate. According to the current cost of Chinese raw silk, the production of 78-point raw silk would find it impossible to make a profit selling it for US$8.50 per pound in the American market. It is said that it needs to be sold at a price of at least US$10 per pound to cover production costs. As for the price of Japanese raw silk at US$16.50 per pound, it is speculated that it may be a mistake for US$6.50. Recently, Japan has been actively increasing the production of raw silk while studying how to improve quality. The goal is to reduce the price of Japanese silk in the American market to US$3.50 per pound. The current quality standard for Japanese exported raw silk is mostly above 83 points. However, most of our country's raw silk is below 83 points. Therefore, the threat to our country's raw silk in the American market is huge. However, our country's raw silk is not necessarily in a desperate situation from now on. It depends on how our country's silk industry researches a comprehensive cooperation plan to reduce production costs, improve quality, and cooperate with our country's favorable conditions of favorable timing and geographical location. We still hope to compete with raw silk from other countries in the international market.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Pilots Redeposit Discount Method</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Joint Treasury, the granting of loans by the bank has focused on the trend of the existing credit allocation system. It has made every effort to assist in the production and sales of essential goods for people's livelihoods, hoping to achieve the principle of smooth flow of goods. In order to encourage the promotion of this policy, the Central Bank has piloted the redeposit discount method for the three banks and two bureaus this week. It is understood that manufacturers across the country can apply to local banks for a discount on export goods with bills of lading or insurance policies, and then each bank can reapply to the Central Bank for redeposit discount. The actual amount is 70% off, the term is 15 to 20 days, and the interest rate is a uniform monthly interest rate of two percent. The Central Bank does not temporarily restrict the interest rate charged by the three banks and two bureaus to direct manufacturers, but it hopes that it will not be too high in order to achieve a reasonable level.</p>
<h3>Cotton Imports: Foreign Exchange Cannot Be Purchased Without Prior Approval</h3>
<p>The Central Bank issued Circular No. 49 on the 5th, notifying all designated foreign exchange operating banks and cotton importers that the Central Bank has recently reported that some importers have imported cotton without prior review by the Central Bank. Therefore, it reiterates the previous order. All cotton imports that have not been pre-approved by the Central Bank, designated foreign exchange operating banks shall not sell foreign exchange. If designated banks violate this regulation, once verified, they will be subject to the suspension of foreign exchange operations. Importers will be subject to the suspension of foreign exchange purchase applications.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Subsidized Sugar: Universally Sold from the 8th: Limited to 3 *jin* per Person, 820 Yuan per *jin*</h3>
<p>The second phase of subsidized sugar for civil needs, which is responsible for by the South Goods Commercial Association, is ready. The required sugar has been shipped from the designated warehouses in Pudong and stored in the Maochang Refrigerated Warehouse on Yanghang Street, No. 16 Pu. Yesterday, the association notified the designated dealers to ship on August 7, and universal sales will begin on August 8. Sold out in four days, the retail price is 820 yuan per *jin*, and each person is limited to a maximum of 3 *jin*.</p>
<h3>Canada Cancels Restrictions on Sale and Use of Bristle</h3>
<p>[Reuters Ottawa, June 6] The Canadian Wartime Prices and Trade Board has announced the removal of restrictions on the sale and use of bristles. However, price controls will continue to be enforced. The Board also stated that if manufacturers revert to manufacturing bristles, their maximum price will be in accordance with the regulations of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and their selling price shall not exceed the maximum price. If the goods manufactured by the manufacturer are not the same as the goods that have already been set at the maximum price, they must apply to the Board for setting the maximum price.</p>
<h3>Airfreight Bristles Carried to Australia</h3>
<p>[Reuters Sydney, June 6] The Australian News Agency announced that the Australian government recently airlifted bristles worth 1 million pounds sterling from China to Australia. In view of the inconvenience of land and water transportation, the Chinese government has specially permitted Australian aircraft to carry this cargo of great value across Chinese territory.</p>
<h3>Yangquan White Coal Blocks Arrive at 200 Tons</h3>
<p>The supply of Yangquan white coal blocks in the coal market has increased relatively. Yesterday, Jiuchang Company transported 200 tons from Tianjin, and the coal *jin* purchased by various colleagues will be shipped one after another in the near future. The buying sentiment is sluggish. Although the sellers are still shouting the original price, the transaction is very few. The United Business Office of coal merchants recently has a large amount of allocation of various types of bituminous coal, so the market is very stable and it is difficult to turn firm for a while.</p>

<h3>Trekking in the Great Gobi: Southern Xinjiang Customs: August 2 Dispatch from Dihua</h3>
<p>— Li Shangzhi</p>
<p>While the reporter was in Jiuquan, Gansu, I received an order from the Engineering Office of the New Southern Xinjiang Highway Segment, in Dihua. To speed up the full line construction of the Southern Xinjiang Highway, I was told to assemble a surveying team quickly. Going west from Dunhuang's Yangguan Avenue, to Jijihe which borders Gansu and Xinjiang, we were to survey westward. Last October, I hurriedly prepared for a week in Jiuquan. Leading the entire surveying team, along with all the necessary supplies and equipment, we set off towards Dunhuang.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Dunhuang</h3>
<p>I think that people who come to Dunhuang for the first time may have a feeling of monotony and disharmony. A city of less than one kilometer square actually has dozens of temples. Even ordinary residences and shops are almost temple-like. All traffic roads in the city are dirt roads. Only the main road running east-west is paved with lime-soil concrete, but it has been in disrepair for many years and is uneven. The largest transactions in the city are carried out here, which is the essence of the entire city. In fact, all the shops are extremely pitiful in form. It can be said that Dunhuang's commerce has a market but no face.</p>
<p>It is said that in the early autumn of last year, when the Gansu Segment Engineering Office of the Southern Xinjiang Highway (building the Dunhuang to Jijihe section) came here, it caused a major fluctuation in the local area. This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so prices—especially food—rose along with the greedy line of the merchants. As a result, of course, they made a "nation-building fortune." This time, they heard that we were coming, and with their endless greed, prices soared again. Unfortunately, all our supplies and equipment were prepared in Jiuquan. This was like pouring buckets of cold water on their burning chests, which greatly disappointed them. I remember once at a banquet, the local Chamber of Commerce chairman said to me: "We have 'adjusted' the prices, thinking we could make a lot of money, but you don't buy anything!" At this time, although my heart was filled with indignation, I couldn't give them a severe rebuke due to the environment. I just responded with a faint smile.</p>
<h3>Camel Transport Brigade</h3>
<p>Going west from Dunhuang's Yangguan Avenue, towards the border between Gansu and Xinjiang, you are approaching the edge of the Great Gobi Desert. In this area, the only means of transportation is camels, because the highway has just begun construction, and water and fuel are a problem, so cars cannot be used. Also, because the concentrated points of water and grass are very far apart, horses and mules cannot be used in this regard. A certain American highway expert, working as a consultant, said that even with the current equipment in the United States, he would not dare to try to build this desolate highway stretching across the Great Gobi. And we, in order to consolidate the national defense of the border, decided to use this primitive means of transportation to build this modern transportation line. You must know that building a highway in the Gobi Desert is relatively easy. The most important thing is transportation.</p>
<p>The construction of the Gansu segment of the Southern Xinjiang Highway started earlier. When we arrived in Dunhuang, they had almost completed it. The camels they hired were gradually being dismissed and returned to Dunhuang. At that time, most of the camel households were controlled by Zhang. He contracted the camel transport work on the Gansu segment. Of course, he made a profit in the middle. In order to adapt to the speeding up construction plan and seize the opportunity, in fact, we could not sign contracts with individual camel households to handle transportation. We had to negotiate with Zhang. Who knew that he initially said that the geographical environment of Xinjiang was harsh, with no water and grass, and camels could not travel. Later, although he reluctantly agreed to help, he used the trick of raising prices from which he could benefit a great deal. Although we tolerated again and again, we were stuck because the unit price was too high. Here, the author reminds me of many thoughts. Our negotiations with Zhang are not like the negotiations between employers and contractors. We don't seem like government employees. We are simply like people borrowing money from others. We spent a lot of time explaining to him the importance of developing border transportation, thereby improving the cultural level of border residents and consolidating national defense, but he didn't put the interests of the country in his heart at all, except for knowing how to stretch out a hand from the coffin to ask for money desperately. Our humility, tolerance, and tactful explanation were all in vain. If a person's conscience is black, the result will definitely be failure. Zhang tried to raise the unit price on the one hand and lowered the unit price to the camel households on the other. How could this not force the camel households to disperse? And the camel households take camel transport work as a lifelong career, how can they give up this big business? They united automatically and elected representatives to contact us. The real laborers are lovely. They only hope to meet their own living needs without coveting excessive profits. They resolutely accepted our conditions, were willing to go deep into the Great Gobi of Xinjiang to undertake transportation, and accepted the fair unit price we proposed. Under legitimate profits, they felt happy that they had not been exploited.</p>
<p>After nearly two weeks of struggle, the camel transport brigade was organized. At noon on November 25, strong camels, carrying the surveyors, carrying tents, instruments, food, utensils, luggage and all equipment, marched at a slow pace. The two-kilometer-long team gradually drove out of the west gate of Dunhuang, and the sound of camel bells echoed in the vast Gobi Desert.</p>
<h3>Looking at the Ocean West of Dunhuang</h3>
<p>After leaving Dunhuang for about fifteen kilometers, it is impossible to see the scattered farmland again. What is presented in front of you is vastness, dimness, and at the edge of the dimness, a calm sky is connected. The camel moves at a slow pace, really what we call "one step three shakes." The person on the camel's back looks far at the up and down moving horizon, like sea waves, like the sky in the ocean, which inevitably evokes endless homesickness. Most of us come from the seaside and have sailing experience. How can this scene not make people miss it! I broke the silence and said to my partner behind me:</p>
<p>"Doctor Zhang, look, that is the ocean, how beautiful!"</p>
<p>"Yes! We are sailing on a 'sand boat'!" He said with emotion.</p>
<h3>Black Wind on the Road</h3>
<p>"Roads are made by being trodden on," which is absolutely true. On the vast Gobi Desert, the so-called "roads" are nothing more than the footprints left by caravan traders centuries ago. Subsequent travelers follow the imprints of these steps, heading towards their respective destinations. After thousands of years of trampling, a winding, light gray strip, less than half a meter wide, has been drawn on the dull gray Gobi. If a stranger follows this strip—the "road"—they will always be led to a place with water and grass (though perhaps not their intended destination). If you deviate from it, you will become lost, even dying of thirst in the Gobi. At first, we looked down on this primitive "road," but later, during the surveying process, we realized that even though we carried many precise instruments, the assistance provided by the "road" was undeniable.</p>
<p>People who have lived in northern regions may have heard of the "yellow wind." On the Mongolian Plateau, in areas of yellow sand, fierce gales stir up sandstorms. It is said that these storms can bury entire caravans. In the Gobi Desert, there is the so-called "black wind." Once the wind rises, people cannot be seen within arm's reach, nor can voices be heard from across the way. The entire space becomes dark. Fine gravel strikes from all directions. Sometimes livestock are even swept away by the hurricane to unknown places. If someone without this experience encounters such a situation, they will become panicked and terrified.</p>
<p>One evening, as we were traveling, a hurricane suddenly arose. The cold wind was biting, and the space grew dim. I quickly halted the camel caravan and jumped down. To my surprise, the force of the wind threatened to knock people over. I simply lay down on the ground and ordered the camel leader (who was accustomed to this kind of life) to drag all the companions over to me, gathering us together. I then instructed the camel drivers to use the camels to build a windbreak. Everyone covered their heads with leather coats and slept on the ground.</p>
<p>The nights in the Gobi Desert are extraordinarily desolate, especially when sleeping outdoors. The wind gradually subsided until midnight. I stretched out my head and looked up at the sky. The faint crescent moon appeared and disappeared intermittently, desolate and silent. "Ah, this is also a fragment of life!"</p>
<p>That night, I, like the other companions, could not fall asleep. It was not until the east showed a faint hint of white that everyone jumped up and moved their frozen, numb bodies. The camel drivers, on the other hand, were sound asleep under the camels' bellies. Everyone complained and expressed fear about the ordeal of the previous night. I knew that in such a situation, I could not say anything. I could only urge the camel drivers to wake up and continue onward.</p>
<p>Later, upon inspection, two camels, eight water buckets, and a portion of the supplies were missing.</p>
<h3>Desert Strongholds</h3>
<p>After trekking across the Gobi Desert for several days, we would wake up early each day to eat a meal, then set out in a grand procession, traveling about thirty kilometers. By dusk, we would stop to erect yurts, cook, and then go to bed. Every day, life was so monotonous and mechanical, and the air seemed unusually dull.</p>
<p>In the Gobi Desert, a journey of thirty kilometers is called a "station" by the local residents. This is the maximum distance a camel can travel in a day. Each time you set out, you must first understand the number of stations between the nearest water source ahead and the starting point, whether there is firewood along the way. You must bring enough food, water, and firewood (if there is no firewood on the road). Otherwise, even a clever woman cannot cook without firewood and water.</p>
<p>From Dunhuang to Jijitai, where Gansu and Xinjiang meet, the Gobi in this section is densely covered with low-grade plants such as saxaul and ephedra. Unlike the plants in "Jiangnan" (the area south of the Yangtze River), the branches and trunks of these plants are not full of moisture. They cannot be used as fuel unless they are exposed to the sun and dried for many days. However, because there is no rain in the Gobi Desert, the plants are very dry and can be used for cooking as soon as they are picked. Moreover, you do not need any tools to collect firewood. You can just kick it with your foot at the base and pick it up easily. These characteristics are unimaginable to people who have never been to the Gobi Desert. On the 333-kilometer highway from Dunhuang to Jijitai, water can only be obtained in three places: Duobagou, Annanba, and Lapeiquan. The water source at Lapeiquan contains a relatively high amount of salt and is not suitable for drinking. However, when there is no other choice, it can only be replaced with ice, because ice contains less salt than water.</p>
<p>We usually call these places where water and grass gather "strongholds." If we lose these strongholds, we will not be able to survive.</p>
<h3>The Kazakh People</h3>
<p>The Kazakhs are one of the fourteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang. They are of the same ethnic group as the people of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. They believe in Islam, and their language is mutually intelligible with the Uyghur language. They are good at riding and shooting, short and stocky, greedy for small gains, and their cultural level is very low. They still maintain a tribal lifestyle. In the southern Xinjiang area, there are a total of six tribes, namely:</p>
<p>Adu Bayi - Living in Yanchiwan</p>
<p>Shala Haiding - Living in Changcaogou</p>
<p>Husiman - Living in Annanba</p>
<p>Jia Nanboli - Living in Yanchiwan</p>
<p>Habudeli - Living in Haizi</p>
<p>Hussein - Living in Laisi</p>
<p>The places where they live are, of course, the so-called "strongholds in the desert." Their daily life is nomadic and hunting. Their lifestyle is very simple. Each tribe includes a different number of households, depending entirely on the strength of the chief. Each family lives in a yurt. A yurt can accommodate two to four people. The yurt is made of short wooden fences forming a circle, surrounded by felt. A square hole is left, with a felt curtain hanging as a door. Branches are used to build a conical roof, which is still covered with felt. A small circular skylight is left on the top of the cone, which can be opened and closed freely. The ground is mostly covered with felt. At night, people sleep on the ground, using the leather coats they wear during the day as blankets. Their daily food is mainly sheep, camels, and game, with flour as a supplement. Usually, each person has a sharp knife. When eating, they use the knife to cut off a piece of meat, put it on the fire to bake it, and then eat it. The flour is made into "small twists" shaped like goose eggs, one for each person. After eating, they drink a little sheep's milk or domestic scented tea. Their lifestyle, of course, does not emphasize hygiene.</p>
<p>Among the six tribes in southern Xinjiang, the strongest is Hussein, followed by Husiman. Last winter, Hussein even married his daughter to the second son of Husiman. They do not intermarry with other ethnic groups. I remember that in the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), Soviet engineers came to southern Xinjiang to survey the Southern Xinjiang Highway (the area we were surveying). As a result, all the personnel were shot and killed by Hussein, and all the property was looted. To this day, the surveying instruments they brought are still stored in Hussein's tribe.</p>
<p>This time, everyone took considerable precautions, because we had to pass near the settlements of the other four tribes before reaching Husiman's territory in Annanba. The work area was also in Hussein's territory. Passing through and working in these Kazakh settlements made everyone feel quite uneasy. Moreover, due to transportation difficulties, it was impossible to bring many armed guards. Fortunately, the government personnel stationed on the border negotiated with them and gave them some bonuses every month. Only then did they agree to help build the road (the so-called "help" can only be interpreted as "not disturbing"). Our survey team also hired one Kazakh and one Uyghur translator and two guides to facilitate translation and negotiation, which made everyone feel a little more at ease.</p>
<p>We advanced along the road to Annanba. Because the water supply was running low, we had to send people into the settlement to fetch water urgently. We also sent a companion and a Kazakh translator, along with some tea bricks and white medicine, to Annanba to meet Husiman in order to establish contact. He was very happy and warmly received my representative. The next day, he sent two fast camels and his eldest son to send my representative out, and brought two sheep to see me. It is said that his mother (Husiman's wife) was very ill and hoped that we could send him some medicine. He also said that after his mother recovered, his father would definitely go into the mountains to hunt some game for us, but he hoped that we could give him 200 catties of flour. He also said that Jijitai was all within his territory and asked us to rest assured. If necessary, he could also follow us and do guard work. In order to avoid some unnecessary trouble, I immediately expressed my gratitude for his kindness, and Dr. Zhang selected some useful medicines for him to take back. Later, Husiman did not come to find me until we finished the survey and returned to Dunhuang. At that time, only a small number of construction team members were at Lapeiquan, which startled them.</p>
<p>I think that the border people are not absolutely savage and irrational. It is only because their cultural level is low, their minds are simple, and they are prone to rebellion and being exploited. Furthermore, because they are lazy and poor, it is even easier to cause rebellion. Therefore, in the future, the government's efforts to promote education in the border areas will be a very important issue. This can be incorporated into the department of political construction for border people, and has the same important significance as economic construction in consolidating national defense.</p>
<h3>Ice Nest and Fire</h3>
<p>After three days of travel from Annanba, we arrived at Lapeiquan. According to the guide, there was no firewood or water ahead. I had to divide a large number of camels to carry ice and firewood, which would add a lot of difficulties to the surveying work. Because there were quite a few of us, even if the daily water consumption was controlled to the minimum (only for drinking, washing was prohibited), it was impossible to support this long surveying route. Now we had to connect the sections and the transportation distance was so long. The number of camels was limited, and the round trip would be delayed, so it was inevitable that there would be a shortage of firewood and water. In order to cope with this special geographical environment and the current difficulties, I decided to adopt a blitzkrieg tactic, extending the daily working hours as much as possible and advancing the survey at the fastest rate. Therefore, we needed to stay in Lapeiquan for two days to collect firewood and move ice to make full preparations.</p>
<p>Lapeiquan is located in a small ditch next to a mountain valley. The climate is unusually cold, and the north wind howls all day long. Even if you wear a five-inch-long fur coat, you will feel the cold wind biting your bones. When I woke up the next morning, I felt that the quilt was cold and stiff. It turned out that the heat exhaled at night had condensed there and become a thick layer of ice. This can be said to be a miracle for us. Dr. Zhang, who was sleeping next to me, was covering his head and curling up, still not awake. The ice on the quilt was sparkling and shining. I shook him awake and said:</p>
<p>"Hey, you're sleeping in an 'ice nest'! Aren't you getting up yet!"</p>
<p>"Ah, it's so cold!" He suddenly stretched out his head, and the ice began to melt on his face, emitting heat.</p>
<p>On the third day of arriving at Lapeiquan, we advanced to Jijitai and began surveying.</p>
<p>Working at sunrise and returning at sunset, living in tents and sleeping on the ground, we can say that we are living the life of primitive humans.</p>
<p>Life is lonely. Every day after dinner, everyone rested and chatted around the fire in the yurt. This was the only pastime and the only comfort each day. The kerosene was frozen and could not be lit, so we had to use charcoal water for lighting. Under the dim light, we ate, brewed strong tea, and talked. Looking back now, it was quite interesting.</p>
<p>Because we had to make a fire for heating, cooking, and brewing tea, etc., the consumption of firewood exceeded the original budget, and we gradually became panic-stricken. As a last resort, we sent a batch of camels back to Lapeiquan to carry firewood. At this time, we were already more than fifty kilometers away from Lapeiquan, and the round trip would take five days. Adding the distance we advanced during the survey, it would take six days to return. Although we tried our best to conserve, by the fifth night, we had no firewood for cooking. Everyone covered their heads and slept to endure the hunger. The next afternoon, the caravan returned. The two cooks forgot their hunger and shouted and jumped, busy cooking. It was not until the food was fragrant that everyone lazily got up and had a hearty meal.</p>
<p>That night, the wind was very small, and everyone gathered outside the tent to chat around the fire.</p>
<p>There was not a single cloud in the sky, and the bright moon was shining brightly, no different from the moon in our hometown.</p>
<p>Old Lan sat on a stone and sighed. Dr. Zhang said jokingly:</p>
<p>"Old Lan, are you thinking about your cousin again?" Everyone chuckled softly.</p>
<p>"Look how good the moon is, and yet we have to run to the Gobi Desert. If I had married my cousin at home, eaten dinner, and had tea and smoked together while looking at the moon, how comfortable that would be," Old Lan said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Hmm, so comfortable, you kid is thinking too comfortably." Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"Hey—the moon is especially good today," another companion said.</p>
<p>The air became quiet again, and everyone looked up at the moving moon, immersed in endless homesickness.</p>
<h3>Returning to Dunhuang</h3>
<p>"The water's boiling, come and drink tea!" I deliberately interrupted everyone's homesickness and shouted.</p>
<p>Everyone thoughtfully drank some tea and silently crawled into the yurt to sleep.</p>
<p>Our surveying route crossed several hills, climbed out of several river valleys (rivers with no water), passed through Hongquan, Hongshui, and the Suoerkuli swamp, pointing towards the Jinyan Pass and soon to connect with the western surveying team coming from Bashikaogong.</p>
<p>We worked hard to advance the survey and were only twenty kilometers away from the western surveying team. Through the telescope, we could see their "big flag" and the activities of the surveyors. So I sent a companion to invite their captain to discuss the connection issue.</p>
<p>The next day, the two teams were even closer, and their captain also came. Everyone agreed that we would connect on the hilltop. Everyone was very excited and surveyed down in one go.</p>
<p>That night, we stayed at the connection point. Old Lan instructed the cooks to prepare a particularly rich dinner: preserved meat, sausages, dried fried phoenix chicken, braised mutton, preserved eggs, and pickled vegetables. After the meal, we drank strong black tea.</p>
<p>"Are you going back to Dunhuang tomorrow?" the captain of the western surveying team asked me.</p>
<p>"Yes. What about you?"</p>
<p>"We are also preparing to go back after surveying these few kilometers."</p>
<p>The workers happily raised a pile of firewood, lit a torch, and roared.</p>
<p>A difficult task was completed, and everyone felt both happy and relaxed.</p>
<p>On the way back, we proceeded at the fastest rate. When we reached Hongquan, we met the construction team, who had completed more than thirty kilometers of the route.</p>
<p>"Amama" (Hello everyone - Kazakh language) everyone greeted each other.</p>
<p>They also brought us a lot of letters. It was really "receiving letters from afar brings smiles," and everyone was very happy. I rode on the camel, reading my large bundle of letters while walking, and overheard someone talking behind me.</p>
<p>"Hey—he's smiling, Old Lan, is it from your cousin?"</p>
<p>"No," Old Lan said, smiling.</p>
<p>"You don't have to lie!"</p>
<p>When we arrived at Dunhuang, it was approaching the end of the old lunar year. Every household had pasted bright red spring couplets in front of their doors, making them look so bright and attractive.</p>

<h3>Responding to Readers' Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>(1) Wang Tao asks: In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), Mr. Jia purchased a set of furniture from Mr. Yi with a written sales agreement as proof. However, Jia did not pay the stamp duty at the deed tax office because it was not permanent property. Later, Jia returned to his hometown to avoid the war and entrusted Mr. Mou, who lived with him, to take care of it and allowed him to sublet it to others, with the rent as compensation. After the victory, Jia returned from his hometown and sold all the furniture to Bing. Several months later, Ding suddenly came forward and claimed that the furniture belonged to him. After Jia's investigation, he learned that the furniture did belong to Ding ten years ago and was given to Yi as a gift, but Ding did not write a gift agreement to Yi. Now there are several questions, please answer them: (1) If the agreement held by Jia, which has not had stamp duty paid, causes a legal dispute, is it valid? (2) Is it valid if Jia pays the stamp duty again before a dispute arises? (3) If it is invalid, what kind of remedy should Jia take in the future if a dispute arises? (4) Ding has not made any statements to Jia for two years after Jia purchased the goods, nor has he made any statements to the caretaker and the tenant. Now he sees that Jia has sold it at a good price, so he wants to take advantage of the situation to create a dispute. If there are only witnesses and no substantial material evidence, is it legal? (5) If Ding wins in court, who of Jia, Yi, and Bing should be held responsible? But Yi sold it to Jia, and Jia sold it to Bing, and the original object no longer exists. How should it be resolved according to law?</p>
<p>(Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers): (1) A certificate without a stamp tax may be subject to penalties in accordance with the Stamp Tax Law, but it can still be used as a certificate. (2) It is not necessary to pay stamp duty at the deed tax office for the sale and purchase of movable property. (3) Jia should have a way to prove that he legally obtained the purchased object. (4) Witness testimony can also be used as a method of proof. (5) Yi should be responsible for compensating the value of the object equivalent to the original object.</p>
<p>(2) Xu Jizhuang asks: My father has raised four sons. Because he is nearly seventy years old, he knows that there may be disputes in the future, so he specially entrusted his uncle to analyze all the real estate in advance during the puppet organization period last year. The property documents are still in my father's hands. Now I am suffering from lung disease and cannot afford the daily expenses of a family of seven. I want to sell the land under my name to make a living. May I ask if it is legal? Please provide an answer.</p>
<p>(Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers): (1) According to the content of the division agreement, if it is a will or legacy, it will only take effect after death. If it is a gift during his lifetime, then the land is property that cannot be transferred without registration. Before the transfer registration is completed, the gift does not take effect. (2) If it is really impossible to maintain life, then according to the law, the head of the family has the obligation to provide support. You should "maintain the lives of seven people" and never allow the descendants of direct blood relatives to "step into the door of begging" and wait to die from illness.</p>

<p>Is the Examination Method Reasonable?</p>
<p>Editor: I am a civil servant from the interior. For my son's enrollment, I have considered it many times and inquired from various sources before finally finding Guoqiang Middle School on Carter Road a month ago. Because it was for the entrance examination for the third year of junior high, after considerable troublesome registration procedures, on the day the exam was completed, my child came back and said that although the questions were quite difficult, he was confident that he would score at least seventy points, because he often ranked first in Chongqing. Who knew that when the results were posted, he would fail, and out of the hundreds of applicants for the third year of junior high at that school, only one was accepted. We have no objection to the acceptance or rejection, but why does the school only accept one person? Is it appropriate to spend the energy and time of more than a hundred people to recruit one standard student? Secondly, during the oral exam, students were forced to stand in the large playground in the sun. The teachers conducting the exam asked each one very carefully, even asking about the occupations of three generations of ancestors. My poor child did not return home for food until 2 PM after starting at 7 AM, and fell ill after the meal and has not gotten out of bed yet. I wonder if such an oral exam is reasonable? Although the school is known for its strict management, this unreasonable treatment should be improved. In Shanghai, there must be many parents and students suffering from the pain and loss caused by unreasonable exams, so I hope your newspaper will correct this. (Mao Zhichao)</p>
<h3>Considering the Current Traffic Situation</h3>
<p>Tricycles and Rickshaws Should Be Restricted Gradually</p>
<p>Reporter: Shanghai is an international metropolis, no doubt. We want to learn from New York and London, but our conditions are far from sufficient. On a personal level, private cars are not so common. They have one car for every four people, while we don't even have one for every thousand. As for public transportation, the buses and trams in Shanghai's urban area are not common enough, and the original routes have too few vehicles. They have three-dimensional traffic facilities, where travel is possible above ground and below ground, but we are still so pitiful with even surface-level traffic! Under these circumstances, how can we learn from New York or London? During the transition period, tricycles and rickshaws are substitutes, and in my opinion, they are still quite necessary. We believe that negative restrictions are not as good as positive development. If cars and trams can become widespread and developed, tricycles and rickshaws will naturally be eliminated. Who wants such outdated things? Negative restrictions may be much more convenient for the one-thousandth (maybe even less) of the car-owning class, but how much inconvenience will it cause for the nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of the people? Another aspect that should be considered is that the impact will not only cause a large number of vehicle manufacturing workers to lose their jobs and create social panic, but also create a black market for vehicle licenses. In short, I also agree with the policy of restricting tricycles and rickshaws, but the time is not yet right. (Mao Daren)</p>

<p>Summer Life</p>
<h3>A Water-Collecting Rooftop is Useful Enough - Why Go Far to Escape the Summer Heat?</h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>According to my observations, nine out of ten people dislike summer. Just thinking about the blazing sun and the feeling of sweating like rain inevitably brings a sense of irritability.</p>
<p>Of course, wealthy people can go to places with cool climates to escape the summer heat, but ordinary people cannot. As for air conditioning, it has too many drawbacks: First, the installation is complex and not suitable for household use. Second, the difference between indoor and outdoor climates is too great, and it always feels unnatural. Third, it is necessary to keep all the windows and doors tightly closed, which also seems contrary to human nature. Many people are thinking: If there were a simple way to naturally lower the indoor temperature without violating human habits, that would be most ideal.</p>
<p>This ideal has now been realized in the United States. Architect Pullman Luns designed a house not long ago that can make the indoor temperature ten to twelve degrees lower than the outdoor temperature. The method is very simple, and the conditions are: (1) The house must have a flat roof, surrounded by edges, which can collect half an inch of water; (2) The roof must be coated with another layer of asphalt to ensure that it does not leak; (3) Install several lead pipe pistons that can automatically adjust the amount of water collected. If the water exceeds half an inch, it can automatically be discharged.</p>
<p>According to this architect, the water on the roof can reflect the heat from the sunlight, thus making the inside of the house much cooler. Because the roofs of ordinary houses can reach a high heat of one hundred and fifty degrees under sunlight.</p>
<p>However, there are two points that must be paid special attention to when using this type of house: (1) The water on the roof should not be allowed to accumulate debris such as leaves; (2) Insecticides must be used frequently to avoid becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects.</p>
<p>To meet the needs, the Meade Wei Company in the United States is already manufacturing a mobile house with a "water-collecting roof" for people to order. Hearing this news in the hot summer is like taking a refreshing medicine.</p>
<p>Of course, according to China's material conditions, Chinese people are not yet qualified to enjoy this kind of good fortune, but this invention is good news for all of humanity. I believe that in five or ten years, China may also build this type of house on a large scale, so that people who are afraid of the heat can have a chance to catch their breath in the long summer. For example, in Shanghai, the summer climate is generally around ninety degrees. If you live in this type of house, the temperature would only be around eighty degrees, which is truly ideal!</p>
<h3>Summer in Luoyang</h3>
<p>— Fan Hong</p>
<p>Although summer in Luoyang is cooler than in Bian and Zheng, it is still not as comfortable as the clear breeze and green shade in the surrounding counties. The population is increasing, the traffic is becoming more chaotic, the dust is getting worse, and the climate is becoming more harsh. When it doesn't rain, it's scorching hot, and when it rains, it's muggy. So many of the air raid shelter doors have been opened again. Presumably, the higher-ups in families and the bosses in shops all go down into the shelters at noon to enjoy the leisurely coolness. In the shelters, they are not as frightened as they used to be. They are bold and relaxed, living a comfortable life. There is no need for fans in the shelters, no mosquitoes, flies, or fleas. The shelters are equipped with lounge chairs, sofas, coir beds, candles, small tables, mahjong, ivory tiles, novels, secretaries, orderlies, staff officers, kittens, puppies… and women.</p>
<p>It is a human paradise, not a human hell, even though it is buried deep in the earth several feet below.</p>
<p>But there is laughter and sorrow here! And even deaths!</p>
<p>How do people spend the summer? Peddlers, vendors, and stallholders curse under the scorching sun all day long: A piece of cloth awning blocks the sun, a round cattail fan drives away the sweat, and their eyes are glued to passersby. Their mouths advertise: "Want one? Shanghai goods…" They forget to worry about being seen by acquaintances while they're just walking.</p>
<p>Soda water is displayed at street corners, bottles lined up like memorial tablets in a martyrs' shrine. These are all local goods, many without labels, and the ones that have labels are counterfeiting Shanghai manufacturers. Anyway, customers drink them up quickly, so it's easy to fool them. Dessert shops also add cold snacks like soda water and sour plum soup. These are all sweet drinks that cool the mouth but not the heart. There is no ice at all. It's not that it's not needed, but Luoyang hasn't evolved to that level yet.</p>
<p>People are afraid to walk in the heat, so the hotel business is much more sluggish than before, so sluggish that the porters sleep all day, stretching their legs and gossiping.</p>
<p>Melons and fruits are also on the market, costing between one and two hundred yuan per pound, and quite a few people are eating them.</p>
<p>Flies fill the streets, halls, and rooms, buzzing and making people irritable. This shows that Luoyang is still quite dirty. The people's habit of swatting flies, their attention to daily hygiene, and the government's propaganda and prevention efforts are far inferior to the provincial capital of Kaifeng.</p>
<p>When the Yi Min Station received DDT, Director Li also had a plan to improve the environmental sanitation of Luoyang. He planned to spray DDT in public places and promote a clean-up campaign in conjunction with various agencies to promote public health throughout the city, but this plan was just a pipe dream. Director Li has been transferred to Xuchang Station.</p>
<h3>The Supply Status of Soda Water in Shanghai - An Overview of Watson's, China Pure, Yili, and Central Factories</h3>
<p>— Cang Fu</p>
<p>In summer life, soda water should be said to occupy an important position. But having experienced several years of war, people who drink soda water may have thought about the dramatic changes that have occurred in the industry!</p>
<p>The reporter visited several soda water factories. The larger factories said that they are currently constrained by various production conditions, making it difficult for them to operate freely. Smaller factories, on the one hand, feel threatened by the high-quality and low-priced products of the larger factories, and on the other hand, cannot afford the various huge expenses. They are lifeless, and some are planning to close down.</p>
<p>It is said that the soda water season is usually from March to September. Most soda water factories rush to make a profit during this period, and then announce their closure, which leads to the problem of unemployed soda water workers. It was heard recently that there was quite a disturbance about this. However, some factories produce regularly. Among these, the more famous Chinese-owned factory is Watson's, and the foreign-owned factory is China Pure.</p>
<p>In addition to producing its own brands of lemon, sarsaparilla soda, and soda water, as well as Vita Orange, Watson's Soda Water Company also manages the popular "Coca-Cola." "Coca-Cola's" main factory is in the United States, where it has strong financial resources, a large scale, and sophisticated equipment. Combined with extensive advertising, it has established a broad global market. The authorized manufacturer in Shanghai is Watson's Soda Water Company.</p>
<p>According to Watson's Company officials, "Coca-Cola" disappeared in Shanghai after the Pacific War. In the first few months after the victory, the U.S. military shipped a small amount of "Coca-Cola" raw materials. U.S. military officials sent personnel to the company to investigate, and the equipment was deemed qualified, so they continued to entrust the company with the manufacturing. However, the production at that time was limited to the supply for the U.S. military. In recent months, shipping has gradually become smoother, and "Coca-Cola" raw materials have also been arriving one after another, so the supply to the general public has resumed. However, due to the limited number of empty bottles, only 3,000 dozen bottles can be produced each day, which are directly shipped to restaurants, cold drink shops, entertainment venues, etc., which is still not enough to meet the demand. It is said that if they could supply as much as possible, even producing 10,000 dozen bottles per day would not be enough.</p>
<p>As for the raw materials of "Coca-Cola," it is said that they are confidential. They are usually pre-mixed in barrels by the U.S. headquarters and shipped to Shanghai, where they are mixed with appropriate amounts of sugar and filtered water. However, the ingredients and proportions must maintain the same standards as the U.S. headquarters, so a bottle is sampled every week or ten days and sent to the U.S. headquarters for quality testing.</p>
<p>Currently, the production of "Coca-Cola" accounts for 60% of the total production of various Watson's soda waters. At the same time, in order to restore "Coca-Cola's" pre-war market in Shanghai, the ex-factory price per dozen is only 3,000 yuan. However, because the supply and demand are so different, by the time a bottle of "Coca-Cola" reaches the drinker's mouth, the price has more than doubled. Watson's Company is currently adding new machinery to increase production in an effort to solve the problem of maximizing supply.</p>
<p>The foreign-owned China Pure Soda Water Company is so large that it can be said to be the leader in China's soda water industry. However, after the Pacific War, its business was completely shut down. This time, as it reorganizes its operations, it seems to lack its former glory due to the changes in the environment. Therefore, when the reporter visited the company officials, their attitude was very casual. They indicated that they did not want to publicize much. After repeated inquiries by the reporter, it was learned that their products include small bottles of lemon, sarsaparilla soda, and orange soda in 10-liang sizes; soda water in 7-liang and 14-liang sizes; dry ginger ale in 7-liang and 10-liang sizes; and large bottles of lemon soda in 24-liang sizes. In total, they produce about 6,000 dozen bottles per day. In addition, they also have large bottles of distilled water in 5-gallon sizes. Currently, their sales markets include Shanghai and also extend to Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places.</p>
<p>In addition, Central Soda Water Company can produce about 2,000 to 3,000 bottles of soda water of various sizes per day. Yili Soda Water Company can also produce about 1,000 bottles per day. The average daily output of the other dozen or so small and medium-sized soda water factories is about 1,000 bottles. However, in terms of machinery and equipment, disinfection devices, and product quality, the gap between the large and small factories is too large. It is said that some small factories, because of the soda water season, mostly operate with a speculative attitude. There is no need to talk about disinfection equipment. The empty bottles and bottle caps they use are mostly collected from outside by hired people. At the same time, because the factories depreciate and dump their products, they have no choice but to reduce the production cost by reducing the quality in order to compete with the large factories for short-term gains. However, the cost of competition is the health of all citizens, which is too high. It is hoped that the health authorities will strictly inspect the quality of various soda water beverages to protect the health of all citizens!</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter heard a very realistic statement from the soda water manufacturers. They said in unison to the reporter: "During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the soda water consumption class has shifted from the upper and middle classes to the general working class. Today, the biggest outlet for soda water is no longer the people in long gowns or white-collar workers, but the rickshaw pullers, cart drivers, and various manual laborers who sell their labor! After a long journey or sweating work, they will not hesitate to take out their money and buy a bottle of soda water to drink. However, how many times do people in long gowns and white-collar workers, who earn tens of thousands of yuan a month, taste soda water during the entire summer?..." These words contain so much sadness and so much depression, but it is an ironclad fact. Looking at the changes in the lives of people at all levels through the lifeless soda water industry, the reporter could not help but sigh three times and put down his pen!</p>
<h3>Fireflies Carry Small Lanterns, While Bringing a Weak Light - Summer Insects One</h3>
<p>— Shao Hua</p>
<p>"Fireflies, fireflies, fly west, fly east, carrying small lanterns by your side…" When cooling off, the children's loud singing echoes in the night air….</p>
<p>Fireflies carrying small lanterns do not have an important position in the starry night, at most arousing the children's play. And material for adults to talk about (that the ancients borrowed fireflies to read is only a legend!)</p>
<p>On a starless night, night travelers can be more courageous because of them, those who fantasize can enter the kingdom of heaven, and lovers can think of his (her) eyes, with a flame of remembrance lighting up in their hearts, bringing about a recollection of the past. Bringing sweetness, but also bringing pain.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate that faint light!</p>
<p>In the dark night, it will bring light!</p>
<h3>Dragonflies - Summer Insects Two - Breaking the Calm Surface of the Water - Preparing to Receive the Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The storm is about to come….</p>
<p>The dark sky makes people feel suffocated, and dark clouds move from afar towards the head. There is no wind, no rain, everything is still, as if frozen.</p>
<p>After a while, there is still no movement….</p>
<p>The reeds are standing straight, and the easily dispersed duckweed are also gathered closely together, waiting for the arrangement of fate. The fish hide at the bottom of the water, not even daring to breathe. The surface of the water is like a mirror that has lost its luster. If it weren't for the swarms of dragonflies flying in the air, one would really suspect that this world had died.</p>
<p>Dragonflies, you are active, active in the time before the storm comes.</p>
<p>Are they sensing the invasion of the storm and want to find a place to settle down? Or are they happily preparing to receive the baptism of this storm?</p>
<p>They fly very quickly, circling in the air, circling… The movement of compound eyes symbolizes the changeable mood, is it fear? Is it joy? Perhaps only they know. After a while, they chase each other, using their tails to randomly dot the surface of the water, temporarily breaking the calm mirror surface. The raindrops are coming, what will become of their fate?</p>

<h3>A Dissection of UNRRA - Special Article from Our Editorial Office</h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) are trendy names in the newspapers, appearing almost every day. Everyone knows that countries devastated by war urgently need supplies and technology. UNRRA's responsibility is to implement relief and rehabilitation in liberated countries by providing these necessities. It's only natural that people worldwide are paying close attention and placing great expectations on this organization! Recently, UNRRA's announcement to halt shipments of all industrial and agricultural equipment to China, followed by reactions from various opinions and the rescinding of the suspension order, created a great commotion. Consequently, UNRRA and CNRRA have become topics of discussion both within and outside the government. Given the attention and concern from all sides regarding these two organizations, we believe it necessary to provide a systematic introduction.</p>
<p>First, let's discuss the purpose of establishing UNRRA and CNRRA. According to UNRRA's former Director-General Lehman: World War II was a true world war. The autocracy of the aggressors had extended to approximately thirty-five nations, hundreds of islands, and the homes of over fifty million men, women, and children. The scenes were the same in occupied Europe and enslaved Asia: people were starving, land was barren, and national economies were utterly destroyed. The severity of the situation was unprecedented. If the United Nations, after winning on the battlefield, could not prepare a comprehensive solution to this fragmented situation, to curb death and suffering, and to lay the foundation for lasting peace, it would inevitably lead to the greatest tragedy in history. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was born out of this compassionate objective.</p>
<p>On November 9, 1943, forty-four United Nations member states (now increased to fifty-two) and other related countries signed an agreement in Washington to establish UNRRA. Its main purpose was to provide food, clothing, housing, and medical assistance to the liberated peoples, arrange for the repatriation of prisoners and refugees, and assist in restoring urgently needed agricultural and industrial production, progressing from passive relief to active rehabilitation, gradually restoring the economies of various countries to normal. For true prosperity must be built on the prosperity of all nations, as the world is indivisible.</p>
<p>Nations Divided into Three Categories</p>
<p>Countries most deeply wounded and whose economies were most devastated at the end of the war can be divided into three categories. The first category includes France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway. Although their territories were occupied, some still possessed colonies, others maintained overseas deposits or held substantial foreign exchange reserves, thus voluntarily remaining outside the scope of international relief. The second category includes Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Their territories were occupied, and they had no foreign exchange reserves, relying entirely on foreign aid and becoming the initial target for UNRRA relief. The third category includes defeated nations such as Italy, Germany, Japan, Austria, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>To carry out such extensive work, UNRRA's organization is vast. The highest authority of UNRRA is the General Assembly, with each member state sending one representative, convening every six months to determine UNRRA's budget and policies. During the adjournment of the General Assembly, urgent matters are handled by the Central Committee, composed of representatives from the four major powers: the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Managing the implementation of policies in each region are two regional committees for the Far East and Europe, further divided into five subcommittees for health, agriculture, industry, welfare, and refugees, each responsible for specific areas.</p>
<p>UNRRA's Finances</p>
<p>As for UNRRA's finances, it is an internationally pooled fund donated by member states that were not invaded. The United States contributed over $1.3 billion, and Britain contributed over $300 million of its own funds... In total, UNRRA has potential assets of $2 billion, used to supply both Europe and Asia. However, according to general estimates, Europe's relief needs amount to $9 billion. Comparing these figures, it is clear that UNRRA cannot solely handle post-war relief and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Above, we mentioned that countries devastated by war can be divided into three categories. However, besides these, China should be classified as an "intermediate category." Because only half of China's population fell into enemy hands, but the country was divided, fought bitterly for eight years, became utterly impoverished, and urgently needed relief. Roughly in the same situation as China are two Soviet republics, Belarus and Ukraine, which were severely ravaged by the enemy.</p>
<p>China's Needs</p>
<p>According to Chinese estimates, post-war relief and rehabilitation require a total of $2.5 billion USD. Considering the length of China's resistance, the extent of the disaster area, and the severity of the destruction, this amount is actually insufficient. However, UNRRA's total funds amount to only $2 billion, so we cannot expect UNRRA to provide us with more assistance than its total budget. After careful consideration, we could only hope that UNRRA would assist us with $945 million, but UNRRA only approved $562.5 million for us. Based on population, this averages only $1.25 per person, while the average for the Czech Republic is $16.59 per person, Greece $52.45 per person, Albania $22.42 per person, Belarus $3.33 per person, Yugoslavia $27.89 per person, Poland $19.31 per person, and Ukraine $3.13 per person. Even the former enemy countries of Italy and Austria received more than our country. Our representatives strongly argued this point, but the results were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>CNRRA's Organization</p>
<p>As for CNRRA, it is the executive agency established by the Chinese government, with its organization focused on operational aspects, divided into departments, divisions, and offices. The departments include storage and transportation, distribution, finance, and disaster relief, while the divisions include general affairs, accounting, investigation, and translation. The office is the personnel office. Its legal status is completely the same as other ministries and agencies under the Executive Yuan, formally established on January 21, 1945, working closely with UNRRA to carry out relief and rehabilitation tasks in the recovered areas of China.</p>
<p>According to newspaper reports, as of the end of June, UNRRA had unloaded 638,921 tons of goods from 183 large ships, with another 25 ships carrying cargo yet to be unloaded, and 10 more still en route. CNRRA has already transported 335,590 tons of these various supplies to the interior of China. Relief supplies include wheat, milk powder, and other food, trucks, tractors, road construction machines, steel bridges, generators, and flat-bottomed boats, etc.</p>
<p>China's Difficulties</p>
<p>However, the difficulties of transportation within China and the limitations of various material conditions mean that the distribution work may not be entirely satisfactory, leading to misunderstandings by UNRRA. On July 9, UNRRA Director-General Riegner announced the suspension of all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment shipments to China, with only essential food such as wheat, rice, grains, and dairy products continuing, but conditioned on the Chinese government quickly clearing the ports and CNRRA distributing the relief supplies to the interior of China in a satisfactory manner. The main reasons for Riegner's abrupt action were said to be two: first, the Chinese government did not provide funding, preventing relief supplies from being quickly distributed to the interior; second, the Chinese government allocated too little to the Communist-controlled areas, thus suspecting the government of using relief supplies as a tool for political struggle.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, in addition to the Chinese government spokesperson issuing a statement, CNRRA Director-General Chiang Ting-fu has also repeatedly clarified the situation. In fact, CNRRA's distribution of relief supplies has absolutely no political influence involved and is entirely based on local needs and the ease of transportation. This misunderstanding stems entirely from the current transportation difficulties in China. The revocation of the suspension order is, of course, proof that UNRRA has gradually understood the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>Heaven Helps Those Who Help Themselves</p>
<p>Although we still feel that UNRRA's assistance is insufficient in quantity, our heartfelt gratitude cannot be expressed in words. However, one point deserves special attention: UNRRA's relief work will end by next spring. If our country makes no progress by 1947, then the future is bleak, and we will have no one to turn to. Both the government and the people should face this reality squarely. In this world, only those who can save themselves can be saved by others!</p>

<h3>France and Italy: From the Yalta Conference to the General Elections</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jun Mo from Newsweek Magazine</p>
<p>The general elections in France and Italy have already concluded. To understand their significance clearly, we must first look at their background, which is the shift in official and newspaper opinions in France and Italy during the sixteen months since the Yalta Conference.</p>
<p>A brief review of the past reveals that many misunderstandings between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union today are largely due to the many ambiguous resolutions of the Yalta Conference, each side interpreting them in its own way. However, in the eyes of France and Italy, the Yalta Conference was not ambiguous at all. In their view, the Yalta Conference was a starting point, clearly showing the victorious powers' contempt and coldness towards them.</p>
<p>Before the liberation of France, the de Gaulle government had already begun to eagerly explain France's future foreign policy stance: preventing the resurgence of Germany and ensuring its own security. De Gaulle envisioned the revival of the old mutual assistance alliance, this time with strong military provisions. The first step of this foreign policy was to conclude a treaty of alliance with the Soviet Union. Even the strongly anti-communist factions in France welcomed this alliance, because they felt it could be a start, followed by the expansion of the alliance to Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. This treaty system was intended to be consistent with the principles of the United Nations, but most French people openly expressed doubts about the success of the United Nations.</p>
<p>However, this dream of alliance immediately hit a major snag. Initially, the French greatly blamed the Americans for excluding France from the Yalta Conference and the subsequent San Francisco Conference of the Big Three. But gradually, it became clear that France's non-invitation was mainly due to Soviet opposition. Supporters of the Franco-Soviet alliance had to open their eyes and realize that the Russians were far less enthusiastic about this treaty than the French. What seemed like a smooth foreign policy turned out to be stranded as soon as it set sail. And with Britain, there seemed to be no possibility of concluding an alliance because Britain was unwilling to separate the Ruhr and Rhineland areas from Germany, which was exactly the opposite of France's plan. From then on, the only path France wanted to take was the international cooperation that could be found in the United Nations.</p>
<p>The main difference between the situation in Italy and that in France was that Italy encountered an even greater snag, and its hope of finding a way out was even more urgent. On February 10 last year, Italian newspapers reported that Prime Minister Bonomi had requested the Big Three at the Yalta Conference to include Italy in the United Nations. Four days later, the government issued a statement denying it, but the illusion had already spread throughout the country. The reply from the Yalta Big Three to Italy's request was complete indifference. This shattered all beautiful dreams. They had hoped that Italy's contribution to the United Nations' war effort could be recognized as the basis for resolving all past issues.</p>
<p>Since then, Italian public opinion has shifted from resentment to pessimism, and finally to jealousy today. Suspicion has caused France to let the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris end without results, but Italy has not even received this small comfort. The only slight comfort was Secretary of State Byrnes' expression of support for Italy's claim to Trieste.</p>
<p>Therefore, the general background for the general elections in both countries this time is one of widespread disappointment and humiliation. Both countries are trying hard not to be drawn into the whirlpool of the conflict between the great powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Both countries are only voting on the most important domestic issues: in France, it is choosing a new constitution; in Italy, it is choosing whether to have a monarchy or a republic. At the same time, both countries are also conducting a test to see how the power of the communists and anti-communists is waxing and waning.</p>
<p>However, whether in France or Italy, domestic issues cannot be separated from a larger issue: how to establish their countries' footing in the interconnected European situation. Every clear-headed person has this idea, knowing that their country is inseparable from the rest of the world. But for the French and Italians today, this problem is the most complex and difficult to decide. Obviously, this is the question that was not written on the ballot in the general elections.</p>
<h3>Japanese Women Are Transforming</h3>
<p>— Yan Jin, translated from a United Press International special article</p>
<p>Japanese women, who have been enslaved by men for thousands of years, are now, due to Japan's defeat, liberated from this slavery and are preparing to step forward and take responsibility for peace in Asia.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Japanese women are more knowledgeable than women in any other Asian country. China, of course, also has great women leaders, such as Madame Chiang Kai-shek, but most rural Chinese women are uneducated. The situation is similar in other Asian countries.</p>
<p>Japanese women today clearly see that if they had actively participated in Japanese politics in the first place, the war that led to national destruction might have been avoided. Today, they have clearly seen through the tragedy of this traditional feudal system, which keeps women at home and uninvolved in worldly affairs.</p>
<p>In the past, women were merely domestic slaves, having to serve everyone's daily needs and personal comfort, so they had absolutely no time to be involved in outside activities. As a result, they were not only ignorant of world affairs, but they were also kept in the dark about everything that happened domestically.</p>
<p>The warlords used the so-called "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" "Women's Instruction" to maintain this feudal system...namely the so-called family system...in order to promote their policy of aggression. They believed that Japanese women should blindly obey, and at the same time, they concealed all news unfavorable to their policies.</p>
<p>But all of this has passed with Japan's defeat, and now a new era has begun.</p>
<p>In this general election, Japanese women have shown their enthusiasm and interest in politics. In the general election on April 10, as many as 15,000,000 women participated in the voting.</p>
<p>Before the election, many commentators speculated that most Japanese women were indifferent to politics, so the number of people who abstained from voting in the election might reach 80 percent. But the result? The facts show that only three out of ten people did not go to vote.</p>
<p>The war not only took away their husbands and sons, but also brought unspeakable suffering in family life to women. Food was also very difficult to obtain. Today, due to the lack of farming tools and fertilizers, food is even scarcer than during the war. It is also for this reason that Japanese women are determined not to let another war break out, and will do their best to prevent the next war.</p>
<p>In order to avoid any international conflicts, Asian women should have this responsibility.</p>
<p>Warlords defeated, women liberated.</p>

<h3>Essays   First Star</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Have you ever, at a lonely dusk, walked alone into a quiet garden, raised your eyes to the sky, and noticed that first, slightly shimmering little star appearing on the dark horizon?</p>
<p>Perhaps she appears too faint and small, and fleeting.  She cannot, like the bright moon, illuminate you with a stretch of clear, beautiful radiance, gently rippling in the vast high sky, making you marvel, making you linger.  She merely shines a few wisps of faint light alone, then is quickly covered by the other stars that appear one after another; in an instant, you can no longer find her.  However, if you are not a forgetful simpleton, you will never forget this first little star that, with a few faint wisps of light, first illuminated the dark night for you!</p>
<p>The first little star! Yes, in my dim life, there has also been a little star that I can never forget!</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in a certain remote mountain city, in a prestigious, aristocratic old school, I was a lonely, miserable girl.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, when I had just woken up from the golden dreams of childhood, surrounding me were beautiful youth, passionate emotions, and distant hopes. Facing a bright little mirror, I had smiled sincerely at my own blushed cheeks; holding the tender, white hands of my companions, I had felt the most sincere warmth flowing from the bottom of my heart; holding stacks of increasingly thick books, I had entrusted boundless aspirations, endless desires. ... But, as soon as I stepped into the gate of that aristocratic school, my enthusiasm and hope instantly cooled down as if they had met ice!</p>
<p>Ice! Yes, I encountered the coldest, sharpest ice in the world, the snobbish cold eyes!</p>
<p>When I first saw many classmates dressed in silk and wearing gold, looking at my worn-out blue cloth cheongsam with mocking eyes, what surged up in my heart was anger and resistance. I felt that what was there to be ashamed of? I just needed to study hard, to surpass them with excellent grades, to make the teachers value me, and what was there to fear from them?</p>
<p>So, I diligently picked up my books. Morning, quiet night, I buried myself bitterly in piles of difficult books, reading softly, calculating slowly, and carefully reciting again and again what I had read and calculated. I knew that I had exhausted all my ability, and I expected to surpass all my classmates, to vent my anger in front of those who laughed at and looked down on me.</p>
<p>But I was disappointed! At the end of the lively semester, I watched one classmate after another go up to the stage, receiving a glorious medal from the principal, they looked at me proudly, and on their faces, there appeared complacent smiles, as if to say: "Hey! You poor wretch! You stupid worm! You think you can surpass us?"</p>
<p>Pain and darkness pressed down layer upon layer, my anger disappeared, and my courage also disappeared. Like a little lamb lost in the dark night, unable to see a ray of light, only strings of bitter tears kept rolling down from my big, round eyes.</p>
<p>Although I was only an eighteen-year-old girl, I had already begun to curse the length of the years, lamenting the vanity of life. In the midst of a group of lively, happy young ladies, I sat alone with a sullen face, like an old man of seventy or eighty, wasting my days in passive, desolate sighs.</p>
<p>It was a late autumn evening, as usual, there was a patch of cheerful laughter on the grass, classmates were happily jumping and playing, but I alone was pacing back and forth, head down, in a dark corner of the wall.</p>
<p>"They're here! They're here! ... Oh! There's also A-Lu, Little Feng... Should we call them to come together?"</p>
<p>"Good! Good! ... You go and call them quickly! ... Hey! Don't forget to tell everyone to bring a cup to hold cocoa, and don't forget to bring a small knife to peel apples! ..."</p>
<p>After a burst of crisp laughter and shouts subsided, the foot of the small maple tree was filled with bright red cheongsams, soft curls, plump delicate faces, bread, butter, apples! Cocoa... But I, still walked silently, pacing by the dark corner of the wall...</p>
<p>The faint setting sun came and quietly shone on the low wall built of red bricks. I turned my head to the side and saw my own dark shadow, so lonely, so desolate, and finally my tears flowed down again!</p>
<p>"Ah! I am so poor, and so stupid, people look down on me, ignore me, what am I still studying for! I might as well die!"</p>
<p>I painfully tugged at my head, angrily threw the two books clamped under my arm onto the ground, and did not notice that behind me, there was a slender figure slowly walking over.</p>
<p>"Ah! What's making you unhappy, that you're throwing your books away?"</p>
<p>I was startled by that gentle voice. Wiping away the tears from the corners of my eyes, when I raised my head, I saw a round face, a pair of thick glasses, and a row of uneven teeth. ... I recognized her, she was a newly arrived substitute teacher in the elementary school department.</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you..." I saw her pick up the books I had thrown down and put them back into my hand, my face burning, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>"You're welcome! I often see you walking here alone. You're a high school first-year student, right? Your honorable surname?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm in the first year of high school..." I didn't dare to look at her, answering softly,</p>
<p>"My surname is Zhang..."</p>
<p>"Zhang! Then we have the same surname! My surname is also Zhang!" She laughed, suddenly pinching my hand, and said affectionately: "Let's go to that pavilion over there, sit and chat, okay?"</p>
<p>The setting sun gradually moved over, and the evening breeze grew stronger. The small garden behind the dormitory was very quiet, with only a few autumn insects hiding in the grass chirping.</p>
<p>Leaning against her slender figure, sitting silently in the pavilion, my head was still lowered, so I saw clearly the half-new, half-old black cloth-soled shoes on her feet, and in my heart, a kind of inexplicable feeling surged up.</p>
<p>Several rows of white daisies in the garden gave off a faint, elegant fragrance. She took a deep breath and, smiling, looked at me and said:</p>
<p>"This place is so good! It's a real blessing that you study here. Why are you still unhappy and throwing your books on the ground?"</p>
<p>"It is a blessing, but unfortunately..." I gave her a bitter smile, not continuing.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately what?" She brought her head closer to me, asking gently.</p>
<p>"..." I was silent, not daring to answer, but I noticed again the pair of half-old cloth-soled shoes on her feet. I finally said boldly: "I am a poor girl, this place is too aristocratic, I feel pain..."</p>
<p>A rustling gust of wind interrupted my words, tousling my hair. I raised my hand, arranging the short hair that fell on my face, and suddenly realized that she was looking at me, from head to toe, and from toe back to head, she was carefully sizing me up.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling pain because you are poor? Ah! That doesn't matter!" She said with a smile: "When I was studying at the normal school, my clothes often had patches, but I didn't care! Let the classmates ridicule and despise me, let them wear silk and satin, I just concentrated on studying hard!..."</p>
<p>"What you say is true, I initially thought so and did so, but not only am I poor, I am also really too stupid! I have exhausted all my effort, but there is still nothing that I can surpass others in..." I was saying this softly, when she reached out a pair of hands to stop me.</p>
<p>"Surpass others! Why do you want to surpass others?"</p>
<p>"Why do you want to surpass others?" This question was fresh. I had never asked myself, nor had I ever heard anyone ask me. Yet, she asked me.</p>
<p>"I... shouldn't I think this way?" I couldn't answer, looking at her blankly.</p>
<p>"Yes, you shouldn't think this way!" After she answered me calmly and certainly, she took her hand off my shoulder, and said with a slight smile: "Wanting to surpass others is sometimes indeed good, it can encourage people to strive upwards, but most of the time, it increases people's pain and sin; making people jealous, making people disappointed, making people discouraged, even making people depressed and die. I think your pain probably comes from this thought, so I hope you will no longer have this thought..."</p>
<p>Saying this, she lowered her eyes to look at the books in my hand, took away a hardcover geometry book, opened it to a page where the circumference radius was drawn, and said to me, pointing: "You know how to draw a circumference, don't you? As long as there is a radius, whether that radius is a foot, an inch, or a tenth of an inch, you can draw a complete 360-degree circle. I feel that being a person is just like drawing a circle. Although everyone's talent and radius are not the same, with wealth and wisdom, everyone can use their own radius to draw a flawless 360-degree circle. So we don't need to envy other people's wealth and cleverness, nor do we need to think about surpassing others, we only need to do our best, and within the scope of our own ability, we can also achieve a perfect, flawless life..."</p>
<p>Listening to her say these words, my head lifted up, looking at her with joyful and grateful eyes, because I suddenly felt that things were bright in front of me. I also saw the clear blue sky, the beautiful white clouds, the fragrant flowers, the green grass... I also seemed to see, between the blue sky and green grass, a quiet, flat road open for me, I was no longer a lost lamb, I already knew the road I should take...</p>
<p>"Thank you! Your words have enlightened me, I understand, I am really happy! I hope I can talk to you every day!" Urged by the sound of a loud dinner bell as I stepped out of the pavilion, I actually forgot my embarrassment, grabbed her hand, and said with the excitement of a child.</p>
<p>"I also really like to talk to you often, but it's a pity that I'm only here as a substitute, I have other things to take care of elsewhere, so I may leave tomorrow!" She said with a smile, with a somewhat regretful tone.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she left the next day. Perhaps because she was in a hurry, she didn't leave an address, nor did she talk to me again, silently leaving our school; disappearing into the vast sea of people!</p>
<p>Time flies quickly, in the blink of an eye, ten years have quietly passed. In these ten years, I have met many good teachers and helpful friends, and heard countless teachings and encouragements, as if under the dark high sky, a sky full of stars has twinkled, and a bright moon has hung up; but I can never forget her, I can never forget this first little star that first illuminated the dark night for me with a few wisps of faint light!</p>
<h3>Scenery</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhen, engraver</p>
<h3>Paul Bourget (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xi Shou</p>
<p>When these novels were published, they were criticized a lot by naturalists, because the characters in these novels were mostly taken from upper-class society, and at that time, naturalists almost did not recognize the existence of upper-class society. Bourget focused on depicting all aspects of reality, and he believed that the study of "upper-class society" was also within the scope of novelists' efforts. The reason why he chose upper-class society was because he felt that people in upper-class society did not have much material worry or occupational constraints, and their emotions were particularly unrestrained, making them easier to analyze. Many of his novels, such as *André Cornélis* (1887), *A Woman's Heart* (*Un coeur de femme* 1890), *Cosmopolis* (1893), *A Tragic Idyll* (*Une idylle tragique* 1896), novellas such as *Recommencements* (1897), *Complications Sentimentales* (1898), *The Twists of the Heart* (*Les détours du coeur* 1898), etc., are all works that analyze emotions. But his greatest success was *The Disciple* (*Le disciple*), published in 1889, which was epoch-making in the literary world and in his own works. After this novel came out, the characteristics of his works reached their highest point, and he resolutely stepped out of his groping period. It showed Bourget's greater focus. From then on, he was not only a psychological novelist, but also a moralist who raised the question of the author's spiritual responsibility. This serious tone of a moralist can be seen in the "To a Young Man" written as a preface: "You are looking in the works of us, who are your older brothers, for answers to those questions that are causing you pain... The answers encountered in those works are somewhat related to your spiritual life and your soul; -- your spiritual life is precisely the spiritual life of France; your soul is its soul. Twenty years later, you and your brothers will grasp the lifeline of this old country -- our common mother -- in your hands. You will become the country itself. At that time, in our works, what will you glean, what will you glean? Thinking of this, every upright literary man -- no matter how insignificant he may be -- will tremble because of the great responsibility he bears..." *The Disciple* is a psychological novel that explains a philosophical doctrine, and it is an immortal masterpiece. The content narrates how a young man privately learns from a famous psychologist, and the young man does evil based on scientific methods, and his cold-blooded ruthlessness is appalling. He wanted to use his work to enumerate the sins of aestheticism and materialism in the book, and to raise the banner of idealism. The author's depiction of the state of mind -- especially the state of mind of the present day -- in its structure and changes, is so profound and clear, that we truly feel the superficiality and tastelessness of naturalistic depictions of physiology! He not only attacks the unacceptable cold attitude towards life of naturalism, but also points out the harm of this irresponsible materialistic philosophy to life. After this book came out, his anti-naturalistic and anti-positivistic attitude became clearer, and later became more and more extreme. Enthusiasm for morality turned him into a conservative and Catholic, and this trend became more obvious in his later works. From a sociologist's attitude and a psychologist's observation, he came to the conclusion that social transformation should have a more peaceful order and a more moral life. This order and life should be Christian society. *The Stage* (*L'Étape* 1903), *A Divorce* (*Un divorce* 1904), *The Emigrant* (*L'Émigré* 1907), *The Tribune* (*Le Tribun* 1911, play), *The Demon of Noon* (*Le Démon de midi* 1914), *The Meaning of Death* (*Le Sens de la mort* 1915), *Nemesis* (*Némésis* 1918), and *A Crime in the World* (*Un drame dans le monde* 1929), etc., are all works in which he vigorously promoted the revival of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>From 1900 to before the First European War, Bourget had a lot of influence in the French literary world and was trusted by young people. Almost everyone in the world read his works. He was simply a leader of young people. But after the European War, he still maintained his original appearance, without any progress or change, just a celebrity, like the other members of the French Academy, unrelated to the world, and in recent years he has almost been forgotten.</p>
<p>Bourget is a literary figure who is good at depicting upper and middle-class society, and he is the first and most authoritative novelist of psychological analysis after Stendhal. He uses patient, slightly clumsy hands to search, describing the state and changes of the mind in detail, lengthily, but powerfully and profoundly. Originally, the complexity of the content and the changes in the mentality of social figures in the late nineteenth century could not be written by anyone other than Bourget with such careful observation and exquisite brushstrokes. Since Stendhal, no one has been able to analyze the inner mind so skillfully. There is no phenomenon in which he does not show us the inner workings. Sometimes he may be a little too delicate, but his intelligence and knowledge are enough to keep our eyes from failing to follow his surgery, layer by layer inward, without feeling burdened. As in *The Disciple*, he uses one hundred and fifty pages to single out a young man, from child to adult, regarding all the environments and forces that cause his psychological abnormality. That kind of precise research is truly astonishing! His novels can truly be described as a document of spiritual history (*Un document d'histoire morale*) as expected by Taine.</p>
<p>Bourget, like Anatole France and Loti, is a writer who straddles two centuries. He spent sixty years of his life immersed in a literary career, was very diligent, and had a prolific output; there are more than sixty books in various styles in total. Among them, the most successful works are no more than the following: (1) Novels: *Cruel Enigma*, *A Love Crime*, *André Cornélis*, *Lies*, *The Disciple*, *A Woman's Heart*, *The Promised Land* (*La Terre promise* 1892), *Cosmopolis*, *A Tragic Idyll*, *The Phantom* (*Le Fantôme* 1901), *Deep Water* (*L'Eau profonde* 1903), *The Stage*, *A Divorce*, *The Emigrant*, *The Demon of Noon*, *The Feeling of Death*, *Laurence Albani* (1919), *Our Actions Follow Us* (*Nos actions nous suivent* 1927), *A Crime in the World*, and *The Judge* (*Le Justicier* 193x), etc. (2) Drama: *The Emigrant* (*L'Émigré* 1908), *A Divorce* (co-edited with A. Cury 1908), *The Barricade* (*La Barricade* 1910), *The Tribune*, *The Time of Peril* (*La Crise*, co-edited with A. Beaunier 1912), etc. (3) Essays and others: *Studies of the Modern Heart*, *New Studies*, *Studies and Portraits*, *Talking about Italy* (*Sensations d'Italie* 1891), *Criticism and Doctrine* (*Pages de critiques et de doctrine* 1912), *Sequel to Criticism and Doctrine* (*Nouvelles pages de critiques et de doctrine* 1922), and *The Duties of Security* (*Au service de l'ordre* 1929), etc. [End]</p>

<h3>Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Father's Day. For those whose fathers are still alive, may everyone treat it as a birthday; for those whose fathers have already passed away, may everyone treat it as a memorial day. Whether it is a birthday blessing or a memorial day remembrance, the principle of respecting parents—revering kindness and repaying virtue—is the same. A son knows the meaning of thinking of the source when drinking water.</p>
<p>I heard that Hong Shen is rushing to rehearse "Spring Cold" and is very busy. In such hot weather, the old gentleman is still diligently working in his position (drama), which is really admirable. Elder Hong has indeed suffered enough in Chongqing in recent years. To exaggerate a little, he is full of illness—stomach disease, hemorrhoids, neurasthenia, anemia. Although he is a professor and dramatist, these diseases seem to be what a newspaper reporter suffers from. Despite the illness, Elder Hong's spirit is far beyond what young people can achieve. I have not yet met him since coming to Shanghai. I hope that due to environmental and nutritional factors, his health will improve. Honestly speaking, the Chinese drama scene really needs him.</p>
<p>The previous three days were the so-called first wave of heat hitting Shanghai. In northern Jiangsu, (1) near the Grand Canal in Xin'an Town, (2) the North Shu River in Shuyang, (3) near the Grand Canal in Xuzhou, (4) west of Gaoyou River—four places were breached, and the water spread, inundating the area. People in Shanghai are so hot that they don't know what to do. There is a queue in front of the Hongkou swimming pool. For this inundated area in northern Jiangsu, are people envious and want to take a leap?</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at eight fifteen, a beggar boy of about ten years old followed me from the Risheng Store all the way to the intersection of Shandong Road. He had patience and perseverance, and I had the same, but he did not fail, because I had already decided not to "encourage evil."</p>
<p>If everyone were so cruel, there would definitely be no beggars on the street. They would definitely find another way to make a living, such as earning a living through labor.</p>
<p>Someone has created the term "clearing out wealth."</p>
<p>Suspecting everything, believing in nothing, what kind of world is this! Terrible, terrible!</p>
<h3>The Story I Love to Tell</h3>
<p>— Kan Kan</p>
<p>Tomorrow is August 8th, Father's Day, and I present this story as a tribute to young readers.</p>
<p>At dawn, it was raining. In Litchfield, England, a small bookstore had just opened its doors. Inside, a stooped old man was wrapping books. The old man, weakened by his frail health and unable to bear the burden of work, coughed twice and couldn't continue.</p>
<p>"Samuel!" the old man called softly.</p>
<p>The sturdy young man sitting nearby was reading a book and didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Samuel!" the old man called again, but he still ignored him.</p>
<p>The old man had to wrap the books himself, struggling to place them in a basket. He coughed a few more times and called out a third time, "Samuel!"</p>
<p>Only then did Samuel slowly raise his head and reply, "Father, what is it?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is the market day in Exeter, and our book stall needs someone to look after it. But I am extremely exhausted, and it's raining..." the old man said.</p>
<p>Samuel slowly replied, "Yes, seeing this situation, I also feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you should let me stay in the shop, and you go to the market!"</p>
<p>However, Samuel kept his head down, reading, and didn't agree.</p>
<p>The old man went outside, looked at the sky. The rain showed no sign of stopping. He put on his coat, took the book basket, and went out coughing.</p>
<p>The rain outside still hadn't stopped.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, on that day, it was again the market day in Exeter, and it was raining.</p>
<p>At this time, a carriage came from Litchfield and stopped in the market square. An old man stepped out of the carriage. He was holding a cane and walked into the market square, panting.</p>
<p>This old man, who had come from a foreign land, walked around for a while and stood in front of a desolate [space], muttering to himself, "Yes, it was here."</p>
<p>He took off his hat, tucked it under his arm, and placed his cane on the ground, standing blankly in the rain.</p>
<p>The clock in the market struck eleven. He remained standing there motionless, the rain pouring down on his head, soaking him through.</p>
<p>At this moment, a brash young man suddenly asked, "Who is this crazy old man?"</p>
<p>"It's Samuel Johnson, the famous English writer. Who doesn't know him?" someone replied.</p>
<p>The clock struck twelve. The strange old man finally looked up at the sky and slowly walked out of the market square to return home.</p>
<p>After Samuel returned home, he said to people, "Fifty years ago, I didn't answer my father's call and didn't serve him. I deeply regret it. Today, I went to Exeter to express my repentance!" After saying this, he wept bitterly.</p>
<p>The rain outside still hadn't stopped.</p>
<h3>Safety First</h3>
<p>— Chong Zheng</p>
<p>According to reliable statistics from the police department last month, there were as many as 283 automobile accidents. On average, more than nine accidents occur every day. Regardless of whether each accident resulted in someone being killed or injured, this phenomenon makes everyone feel unsafe!</p>
<p>If this continues, the roads are indeed more dangerous than a tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>Suppose a good person wasn't killed by the enemy on the front lines or bombed by airplanes in the rear during the eight years of the war of resistance, and today, with the war won and returning in triumph, they pointlessly lose their life under the wheels of a car, being bloodily crushed to death on the road, isn't that too unjust?</p>
<p>For the life security of all 3.7 million citizens of Shanghai, we must loudly appeal to the authorities in charge of directing and managing traffic in this city to earnestly pay attention to this serious problem and quickly come up with proper solutions!</p>
<p>Life is at stake, not a small matter!</p>
<h3>Serial Cartoon - Sanmao Joins the Army (69)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>Parasol Show</h3>
<p>Workers' entertainment is always a concern for entrepreneurs, but the owner of the Japanese Mikimoto Pearl Company has come up with something special. The eighty-seven-year-old businessman, Mikimoto himself, sleeps bare-chested on a bed, turning over on his back, and uses his feet to perform a parasol show. The female workers watch, and everyone is happy. It is said that this has reduced labor disputes in the company.</p>
<h3>Such a Wife, Such a Home</h3>
<p>— Qing Yan</p>
<p>In an old-fashioned tenement house, the protagonist is a short man in his thirties, silent and taciturn. Every morning, he rides his bicycle to the office and returns at five o'clock. He embraces the principle of spending no money, so he doesn't smoke, drink, gamble, play chess, read, exercise, or donate. He doesn't even go to movies, plays, or parks. He doesn't care about the actions of his wife, children, and servants within his family. No matter how chaotic things get, he remains oblivious. His only life is being an office worker, earning a salary, and engaging in petty speculation. He simply has no outlook on life. His wife is about the same age, well-built, and has a loud voice. Her specialty is mahjong. She can start a game early in the morning and play until the next day. She is familiar with "one-bar high," "green dragon," "joker," and "temple melon" early in the morning. As long as she sits at the mahjong table with a tile in hand, everything else ceases to matter. Whether it's a cold winter snow, a hot summer, firewood, rice, oil, salt, children crying, wind, rain, thunder, or lightning, nothing can shake her passion for mahjong. If an atomic bomb were tested in Shanghai, she could be as calm as a goat grazing on Bikini Island. Her children are dressed in rags, covered in dirt, and tuition fees are too high, so they have stopped going to school. They kick balls and fight in the house, and a scratchy radio is turned on with ghostly howls, playing endless, lengthy advertisements with low-level humorous Shanghai opera and Yue opera. They have an appetite for listening to what pill is sold at a certain number on a certain street at a certain mansion, or what powder is sold at a certain young lady's place. The tranquil air of the neighborhood becomes like a chaotic variety show or a store's grand sale. Her maid's deafening voice, from morning to night, is either laughing, shouting, or scolding, truly causing chaos and disruption. Under all these circumstances, the protagonist slowly and methodically wipes his bicycle or sits in the room, staring blankly. The sound of mahjong, the sound of the radio, the sound of laughter, the sound of scolding, the sound of crying, the sound of noise, the sound of fighting—none of these evoke even the slightest feeling in him. Alas, such a family!</p>
<h3>Grievances</h3>
<p>— Zuo Po</p>
<p>Elementary school students bow to the teacher.</p>
<p>Middle school students nod to the teacher.</p>
<p>College students wait for the teacher to greet them first before returning the greeting.</p>
<p>Students studying abroad expect the teacher to bow to them first.</p>
<p>Going to school to get a diploma is like going to a company to buy something, only getting a receipt.</p>
<h3>Tutoring</h3>
<p>— Xiao Jizhang</p>
<p>Last Sunday, several classmates came to visit. Because many hadn't seen each other for a while, we couldn't help but chat and laugh, exchanging recent updates. From the conversation, I learned that they had recently hired a tutor who would meet with them on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to tutor them in English. As they were leaving, they kindly asked me to go to their place tomorrow afternoon to listen to the lecture and even hoped that I would join them!</p>
<p>The next day, because of the prior engagement, I had to brave the heat and rush over. I probably arrived a bit too early. The tutor hadn't arrived yet, and my classmates were all gathered around a table playing Russian Pai Gow. I had no interest in this, so I had to sit quietly on the side, reading the newspaper to pass the time!</p>
<p>After about an hour, the tutor finally arrived late, with a short, stout body and wearing a Hong Kong-style suit. He looked very comical. If you didn't say so, no one would believe he was a teacher; they might even suspect he was a salesman from a foreign company!</p>
<p>Logically, when the teacher arrives, everyone should clean up the mess. However, my classmates were having too much fun to stop first. While they continued their work, they told the teacher to lie down on the bed and rest for a while, allowing them to play one more round before tutoring. The teacher was very good at catering to their psychology, telling them not to be impatient and to play slowly, while his body slowly fell onto the bed, really closing his eyes to rest!</p>
<p>With great difficulty, they stopped playing, and the teacher had also rested enough. Then they began tutoring. Next to the table were placed watermelon, soda, and other summer cold drinks. They ate and taught, and their appearance was still considered serious. After the cold drinks were finished, their attitude became lax. In the end, they simply closed their books, and everyone began to chat, talking about everything under the sun. Time passed quickly, and the tutor picked up his straw hat and swaggered out the door.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to join them in tutoring, but after seeing this, I would rather take a nap at home than run around in the streets in the hot weather and suffer.</p>
<p>Such tutoring deceives oneself and makes things difficult for the father!</p>
