<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕二中全會主席團，一日下午六時在中央黨部禮堂舉行會議，對大會議事日程及輪流担任每次會議之主席名單，有所決定。</p>
<h3>開幕詞全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕蔣總裁一日晨出席六屆二中全會，致開會詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>各位同志：</p>
<p>今天我們舉行本黨第六屆中央委員第二次全體會議，各位同志在抗戰勝利以後，第一次聚首一堂，本席感覺得無上的快慰。</p>
<p>全體會議的任務，是要檢討渦去的工作，分析當前的局勢，以決定今後努力的方針，而我們這一次全會，舉行在抗戰勝利結束以後，復員尙未完成，建設正待開始之時。又正在我們決定召開國民大會，制頒憲法，實施憲政的前夕。所以這一次會議的任務，更見重要。我相信各位在會議期中，一定能對各方面作詳盡的檢討，以求得精確的結論，現在我先就個人的感想與希望，扼要的向各位陳述。</p>
<p>三項使命已完成　兩大任務推行中</p>
<p>這次全會，距離我們第六次全國代表大會與一中全會的閉幕，已有九個月了。代表大會賦與本屆中央的使命，計有五項：（一）爭取抗戰勝利，（二）促進國際合作，（三）貫澈民族主義，（四）完成民主憲政，（五）提高人民生活，對於這五項使命，中央無時不兢兢業業，以求其實現。一中全會閉會以後三個月，日本無條件投降，我國八年餘艱苦抗戰，獲得勝利而結束，同時，國民政府對於國際安全機構的促成，盟國永久邦交的敦睦與互助合作的增進，已盡了很大的努力。對於扶助邊疆民族目治，以貫澈民族主義，亦根據總理遺敎，而有具體的決定，可以說，前三項使命，均已陸續達成，所留下來的兩大任務，就是實施民主憲政與提高人民生活。這兩件大事，都是木黨革命奮鬥的極終目標，有賴於政治建設與經濟建設的策進，但是經濟建設與政治建設，又是密切相關的政治問題，得不到切實的解決，經濟建設就無法進行。我們在抗戰之初，本以抗戰建國同時並進爲目標，因此在抗戰結束以後，我考慮整個國家當前的局勢和全體人民迫切的需要，就決定了和平建國的方針。一方面排除萬難，收拾戰局，恢復秩序，加速進行復員的工作，使人民能得到休養生息的機會。同時，更提出了「軍隊國家化」「政治民主化」的兩大要求，號召全國，一致協力，以促其成功。其具體意見，關於政治民主化的：則為國民大會的及早召開、社會賢達與各黨領袖份子的參加政府，人民自由的保障，政黨合法地位的承認。關於軍隊國家化的：則爲全國軍隊統屬於國家，在我國領土之內，不再有私人的軍隊，亦不再有任何一黨的軍隊，務使全國軍隊皆受國家的編組，尊重軍令與政令的統一。我們這一個決策，我曾詳晰說明於去年九月三日勝利日之演詞，各位同志，想必已經洞察無遺了。</p>
<p>以大公至誠精神　消除困難與阻力</p>
<p>我們以貧弱的國家，進行了八年餘長期的抗戰，而且在抗戰中間還存在着變亂分裂的危機與擾攘，紛爭的因素，所以我們要由戰時渡到平時，要進行復員建設的工作，所遭遇的困難與阻力，特別繁多。這些困難與阻力，我始終認為唯有一最大的忍耐來克服，以大公至誠的精神來消除。也要秉着我們歷屆決議「政治問題，用政治解決」的方針來處理，因為我們國民革命的目的，在救國與建國，抗戰結束以後，建國的成收，為國家存亡之所關，而建設之先決條件為統一與和平，抗戰八年餘之久，殘破犧牲，不可數計，人民流離痛苦，渴望還鄕樂業，所以人民最迫切的需求，也在於和平與安定。我們在抗戰結束以後，種種擾攘紛爭的現象，不堪追溯，但是我們實施憲政，還政於民的志願，因種種的疑難阻碍，而沒有實現，我們和平建設的國策，由於全國未能達到精誠團結與眞正統一，而無法順利進行，則是我們認為必須解次的困難，也是革命建國的本黨無可旁貸的責任。</p>
<p>由於上述局勢的分析，各位同志就可以明瞭我們這九個月中間，一貫以政治方法，解次紛爭，以商談方式，停止軍事衝突，以及召集政治恊商會議的由來，我們為了　實踐召開國民大會，及早實施憲政的宏願，為了愛惜戰後國力民力的凋殘，為了促成國內進一步的團結，所以我們一方而承認各黨派的合法地位，一方面邀集各黨派人士與無黨派之社會賢達，舉行了三星期的政治恊商會議，對軍隊國家化，政治民主化問題與各方面相協議。會議的結果，計有五項，（一）擴大政府組織，（二）和平建國綱領，（三）軍事問題，（四）國民大會問題，（五）憲法草案的審議，在這些協議之中，最主要的精神，就是我們總理的三民主義，獲得了全體一致的擁護與遵奉，而我們政府在協商會議之時更是推誠相與，在不違背革命主義，不動搖國家法統之下，不惜變通總觀關於建國程序的遺敎，以求得和平建國的機會，這是本黨為國為民的一番苦心，各位同志所必須深切瞭解的。</p>
<p>過渡期相互砥礪　作實施憲政準備</p>
<p>上面所述的各項協議，憲法草案正在審議之中，而軍隊國家化問題，已由軍事三人小組商定了軍隊整編與統編中共軍隊為國軍的基本方案，祇待如期實施，我們期望各方面都能眞誠一致，為國為民，使國家走上和平建設統一民主的大道。我覺得祇要國內的和平統一，有了保障，國家能有長治久安的基礎，我們都應該以全心全力，促其有成，古人有言，「精誠所至，金石為開」，我們本黨要首先推誠置信，我相信必能以一片精誠感動其他黨派，而造成堅强的互信，以利建國大業的進行。</p>
<p>我還要向各位同志申述的，抗戰建國同時並進，本是我們旣定的國策，而及早實施憲政，還政於民，更是我們一貫的大願，我黨說，「我國實施憲政以後，必須使各政黨在民意之前，以和平方法作公開的政治競爭，乃爲符合於民主的精神」。現在這一個過渡階段，正是我們與各黨派相互觀摩，相互砥礪，以開創民主規模的時期，我們就要作實施憲政以後的準備，我們要與各政黨處於同等的地位，但是我們本黨，還負有捍衛主義，保衛民國的特殊義務，我們黨的地位，較之抗戰結束以前，巳稍有不同，而在憲政實施以前，我們在法理上與事實上，還不能退卸，我們對於國家所負的責任”因此這次全會，應該就今後本黨努力的方向，作一番深切的檢討。我以為下列諸點，應該特別注重：</p>
<p>移轉工作的方向　去領導民衆建設</p>
<p>第一，要轉移我們黨員工作的方向，鼓勵我們同志，各自發揮其個性能力之所長，往文化事業，經濟事業與地方自治工作上之努力。在這些崗位，促進國家建設的進步，也正所以鍛鍊我們自身的進步。</p>
<p>第二，要使每一黨員都能認識為民前鋒，為民服務，是革命黨員最大的天職，不論擔任何抓職務，都必須隨時隨地，先之勞之，領導民衆，從事建設事業。同時，要盡量解除民衆的痛苦，增進民衆的利益，惟有這樣，才能，才可以加深民衆對於本黨　義的信仰。</p>
<p>第三，要喚起我們黨員，　擭本黨革命的歷史，堅定其貫　主義的信心。本黨五十年革命奮鬥的往績，每一度的成功，無不是得力於自我犧牲的決心和日新又新的精神，現在我們面對着偉大的建國時期，更須發掦光大我們先烈的偉業，積極邁進，以　全功。</p>
<p>第四，要明暸現在是本黨促根本上整理刷新的大好時機，我們一方面要作一個普通的政黨，一方面要保持中華革命黨時代的精神，來加强本黨的組織，因之機構必須緊縮，紀律更須謹嚴一步聚必須齊一，工作更必須振密。</p>
<p>上面這幾點是重要的原則，至於如何改正已往的缺點，如何達成健余本黨的目的，如何使本黨能適應當前的新環境，而盡到我們對國家民族的天職。希望各位同志聚精會神的，加以討論，總之，我們臨此千載一時的建國良機，必須振奮惕勵，自憂百强，以期不愧為總理的信徒，而達到我們保持勝利成果，完成國　革命的神聖使命。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕國府一日令：（一）特派邵力子爲國民大會籌備委員，此令。（二）特派張厲生爲國民大會代表選舉總事務所主任，此令。</p>
<h3>管理族順軍委會　我參加人員即將指定　美準備恢復駐瀋哈大連領事館</h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕關係方面消息：（一）管理旅順之中蘇軍事委員會，業已開始籌備，東北行營即指定參加該委員會人員，聞被指定人員將先赴渝與蘇方洽商，然後前往旅順。（二）東北蘇軍之老弱部隊，多數已調返本國，前來接防者，傳係自波蘭調來士兵，皆甚年輕。目前東北蘇軍之總數，較前有增無减。（三）瀋　·營口一帶共軍，有撤集敦化徴象，發言人稱：共軍於遼寗北部之彰武，南部之合安近取攻勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕美國務院今日稱：美國駐瀋陽·哈爾濱與大連之領事館，一俟可實行時即將恢復。國務院某發言人對重慶方面所傳美國外交家三人刻在渝待命，準備在未來十日內將上述三領小館重開一節，拒絕批評，渠對於大約日期，亦不願有所說明。</p>
<h3>雞尾酒會內充滿樂觀　東北衝突可解決　整軍以外問題已在商談中</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日急電〕變幻無常之東北問題，刻似又形樂觀。張治中於今晚調處執行部三委員主持之雞尾酒會中肯定謂：蘇聯一定撤兵，且已快了。東北軍事問題，因整編·統編方案之成立，已將問題解決一半，剩下的問題，已開始商談，相信此次回渝後，即可獲得協議，並將公布。周恩來亦謂：關於整軍以外之東北問題，中共與政府已開始接觸，執行部將可能派若干人員前往東北，主持停止衝突與恢復交通工作。記者問以東北整軍與調處工作，將在蘇軍撤退前開始抑在撤退後開始？周答，這問題太具體了，我不能答覆。記者詢以對蘇聯朱自東北撤兵有何意見？答：中共曾與各黨派聯合請政府公布中蘇交涉眞象，但政府未公布。繼有記者詢問彼對中·蘇經濟談判有何意見？周答：渠未知內幕，無從作答。</p>
<p>張周馬昨飛　集寗張家口</p>
<p>〔聯合社張家口一日電〕馬歇爾，張治中，周恩來，今日飛抵張家口與集寗，經中共領袖保證「立刻完全服從」三人委員會之任何命令，頗表欣慰。三人此行改乘G47型運輸機，降落於風雪撲面之小型飛機塲，在機艙內舉行會商，中共方面向三人委員會提出完全協力之諾言者，乃共產黨冀察晋政治區副委員長劉君及綏晋境內共軍將領賀龍。據賀龍稱，渠準備於接奉三人委員會命令後，即刻遣散其部下訓練有素之七萬軍隊，若輩以農民居多，均可返鄕耕耘。三氏抵此後，中共領袖復向之申訴，謂中央軍曾攻擊共軍所佔城鎭，劉君又謂：今日一般情况，除小衝突外，尙稱寗靜。日本崩潰時，冀察晋區中共軍，曾派「數千」名入東北，至今仍留該區。因東北人民盼望中國軍隊殊殷，故中共派軍前往。惟冀察晋政治區與東北蘇軍並無接觸，其他中共軍區，是否與蘇軍有聯絡，則非渠所能說明云。馬民一行在張家口與集寗聽取兩地執行小組報吿，「極令人振奮。」張家口儼如武裝兵營，荷槍者觸目皆是，中共領袖邀宴馬氏於司令部，有　美製輕機槍之士兵守衛。馬氏一行定今夜啓程返平，明日續赴濟南與徐州視察。</p>
<p>〔聯合社集寗一日電〕馬歇爾特使今日飛抵此間機塲，因入城交通工具，遠在哩餘之外，且僅有吉普車一輛，乃在機中召開中國政府中國共產黨與美國三方面之國際會議，與會者均就機中弔綺而坐，談一小時，馬氏旋稱，「曾開G47型機之弔椅有種種用塲，今又供一新用途」。</p>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕行營主任李宗仁，今晚設宴招待張周馬。</p>
<p>若干大問題　待在渝商決</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕馬張卿將於國民黨二中全會閉會前，完成　華北視察而返渝，與中樞當局商次若干重大問題。吉倫將軍隨馬帥等來平，此曾與蘇軍良好合作切斷波羅的海德軍後路之三星將軍，即將担任調處執行部實際重要之工作。記者判斷彼之參加執行部，可能為執行部工作，將擴展至東北之徴兆。今晚雞尾酒會中，周恩來曾將執行部高級人員一一與吉倫介紹，周並盛讚吉倫將軍在歐洲之輝煌戰績，與其學者風度。目前調處執行部工作，仍時有困難發生，如最近之保定衝突，即其一例。今日葉劍英坦白語記者，各地共軍亦有少數想佔小便宜，而多佔幾個村莊者，但執行部方面，決予有效制止，故停止衝突之將完全成功，實不容懷疑。至恢復交通問題，記者吿以聞泰安兗州間鐵路共軍，已自行開始修復，膠濟路張店博山間亦然，惟皆自派局長及管理人員，至津浦平綏平漢各路戳至今日，仍以各處共軍未奉正式命令，未獲開工。葉劍英對此解釋謂，許多交通小組，尙未派出，故修復工作尙未能實際展開。</p>
<p>主席親慰問　李烈鈞家屬</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕蔣主席廿八日下午四時親至李故委員烈鈞寓廬弔喪，並慰問其家屬。</p>
<h3>張治中在平談　伊寗已無問題</h3>
<p>和解附件即將簽字</p>
<p>〔本報北平二十八日電〕新疆伊寗人民要求地方自治問題，最近即可獲得解決。張治中將軍對本報記者談：彼與伊寗代表所成立之和平解決伊寗問題方案第十條之附件（即方案第二附件），彼不久即可前往簽字，故所謂伊寗事件，將不成問題。西北行營將轄甘、寗、靑、新四省，綏、陝二省是否包括在內刻猶在政府考慮中。彼何時赴蘭及行營何時成立，俱尙未定。</p>
<h3>昆明中航公司　暫時停售客票</h3>
<p>〔木報昆明廿八日電〕昆市中央航空公司，奉令自三月一日起暫時停售各綫客票，大部份飛機集中重慶，除供還都之用外，並為交部運輸器材。</p>
<h3>中央銀行新任總裁　貝祖詒昨日視事　發表開放外匯重要談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新任中央銀行總裁貝祖詒氏，（見圖）於昨晨十時，由宋院長伴同，赴外灘中央銀行，先行視事。當由宋院長召集該行全體高級人員訓話，並予介紹，略稱：中央銀行爲先　總理所手創，其時本人奉命籌備開設，資本僅毫洋三千二元，規模極小，後賴逐步苦心經營　劃，始能有今日之規模。貝先生為金融界前輩，且任中央銀行理事，對外匯事宜，尤具經騐，故深信今後必能大展鴻圖云。嗣由財政部代表戴銘禮，來賓代表徐寄廣等，相繼致詞，對中央銀行今後業務之開展，及貝氏之榮膺重任，成寄予無限之期望。旋由貝氏答詞，略稱：宋院長對我國戰後經濟復員工作，煞費苦心，本人深為知悉，現因外匯問題亟待解次，故奉命先行視事，再定期就職。今後對外匯事務之處理，當一秉中央規定辦理，甚望各位惠賜協助云。末由該行副總裁陳行致詞，强調該行成立經過之艱困，並望各同仁繼續努力，使中央銀行成為銀行之銀行云。</p>
<p>又訊：貝氏先行視事後，即發表新任林鳳苞爲該行業務局局長，林維因為該行外匯審核處處長。昨晨各界往賀貝氏視事者有錢市長·宋漢章·徐維明·劉攻芸·朱閏生·胡筠秋·王志莘·徐學禹·顧翊羣·楊蔭溥·秦潤卿·吳蔚如·劉鴻生·杜月笙·何德奎·楊志雄，及花旗大通麥加利匯豐等外商銀行經理等多人。</p>
<p>貝氏談話</p>
<p>本報記者昨特趨訪新任中央銀行總裁貝祖詒氏，對中行此次開放外匯市塲，恢復自由買賣之揹施，提詢問題多則，承貝氏詳為解答，茲歸納三點如次：（一）中央銀行此次對黃金及外匯之行市，無所謂掛牌，對外匯及外幣之價格，則係察酌市面情形，於必要時，設法使之平衡，此後中行將通過外匯經紀人，視市面之需要，供售或收買外匯。（二）指定經營外匯業務之銀行行名及家數，大致於今日可發來。至核定項下甲種准許經營行號之銀行銀號錢莊，及乙種准許經營行號之旅行社，該甲乙兩種行號之申請，現雖無特別資格及名額之上規定，惟媧去須眞正有該項業務經營者，方予考慮。至核定之外匯經紀人，亦須視其手上實際有無進出口業務可做，過去僅恃投機買賣為業務者，將不予考慮。又核定項下之甲乙兩種行號及外匯經紀人，其經營業務之時期，均有限定，期限中成績表顯良佳者，始予繼續經營，否則將取消其經營之資格。（三）此次政府指撥美金五億元為法幣準備金，係於中央銀行現有之外匯基金中撥出一部，與以前平準基金之組織及辦法，兩皆不同，以前比較固定，現則着眼於國際收支之平衡，以公開市塲買賣之方式，善加活用，俾使全國貿易機構，納於正軌，對國際貿易，亦望因而疏通，以完成我國經濟復興之計劃。</p>
<h3>華北軍事機構　仍將暫維現狀</h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕戰區當局表示，華北軍事機構仍暫維現狀，在局勢未澈底澄淸前，長官部等機關，尙不能取消。白崇禧來平已傳達政府復員整軍意旨，但目前亦難立即開始，孫連仲語記者，冀省府暫緩移保，因該處房屋極感缺乏，河北省政因遵停戰令，亦暫維現狀。</p>
<h3>錫學生示威遊行</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫一日電〕無錫各大中學校學生萬餘人，爲響應愛國擭權運動，一日上午九時半集隊舉行示威遊行，並發表宣言，沿途高呼口號，遊行全城，歷三小時，情緒熱烈，至午刻始散。</p>
<h3>滇西受慘災重　中央辦理救濟</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿八日電〕中央近以滇西五萬方公里地區前遭敵寇蹂躪，受災慘重，決定由救濟總署在滇西設幹事處，派徐頌九主持其事，徐氏定三月初赴滇西　備設處。</p>
<h3>上海到秦皇島　〔一〕本報東北特派員</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員　韓淸濤</p>
<p>—隨軍北征海上六日記—</p>
<p>一個太陽初昇的早晨，四隻載重四千噸的美國海軍登陸艦，滿載着我們一批青年新軍，駛離了上海，海鷗翱翔，滑行，表示着歡送和擭衛的熱情，始終不離開這隻朝着海外開行的大船。</p>
<p>起光，中國銀行行和百老匯大廈，和我們離遠，慢慢的模糊起來，不久就看不見了，繼而楊樹浦工廠的烟囟，江灣的飛機塲，接近，遠離，終而船出了吳淞口，揚子江的水流，把我們送進了汪洋大海。</p>
<p>這是二月十九日上午的事情，船上的靑年軍，是第二零七師的一部份，他們從大西南的曲靖，步行，坐車，乘船，來到了上海，現在又從上海開赴離開祖國懷抱十四年的東北，記者就參加在這些熱情的隊伍裏，同去看我們東北的父老諸姑兄弟姊妹們。</p>
<p>幫助我們運輸的美國四艘船隻，一艘緊跟一艘鼓浪前進，記表乘的是第一艘五九六號領隊船，不幸的因爲機械損毀，不得不和其他三船吿別，獨自折回，駛進了吳淞口，靠上了九江碼頭，等待換船。</p>
<p>第二天上午，同樣的一艘登陸艦靠攏來，號數是七一四，打開船頭鐵門，人上甲板，彈藥，槍枝，被服，麵粉，大米，就由着這批活躍的靑年軍，從原船搬到另一船，經過了一天零半夜的搬運，遷移工作完成了。廿一日的上午，新換的登陸艦，升起了各色旗幟，把這批靑年隊伍，重新帶上了征途，與前次所不同的，是成了沒伴侶的孤舟。</p>
<p>靑年軍的勇士，多半是來自大後方的學生和公務員，活潑，健壯，富有學習精神，大家搶着看書報，有時在守衛值崗的時候，還手不釋卷，偸着潛誦默讀。又在好多的塲合，大家互稱「同學」，於是成了軍旅中的佳話。這次船上生活，也是同一的情景，他們多半沒有看見渦海洋，所以都渴望着一親她的芳澤，可是很令人失望的，第一天大半天的航行，都是浮在况濁的揚子江水浪裏。</p>
<p>傍晚，鮮紅的太陽，沉入了海底，潮水來了，船身開始動搖，左幌右擺，越來越兇，甲板上吃晚飯的人們，好像吃醉了酒，站不穩了脚跟，東倒西歪，很難走到預計要到的地方，接着是艙裏和甲板上人們的嘔吐，哇，哇，蔓延到了每個角落。</p>
<p>登陸艦重心在後面，司令塔，笨重物品，都在那裏，所以是前輕後重，人在前面，加以吃水淺，所以就是沒有遇見驚濤駭浪。左右傾側的角度也相當大，弄得人人跌倒，爬起，嘔吐連大，這樣混亂的塲面，繼續了三個鐘頭，快近夜九點鐘的時候，船不大搖動了，大家昏昏迷迷的人睡了，一切陷人了沉寂，夜的恬靜海面，只有露着半邊臉兒的月姐，伴着這隻孤舟航進。</p>
<p>光耀，晴期，無際碧綠，船側倒退着發出沙沙聲響的浪花，捲浮在澄淸的水面，好像一片牛乳泡沫，風平浪靜，風光異樣美麗淸新，大家好像從噩夢裏走到了另一個安樂世界，這纔感覺到了海的偉大和親切，愉快的神情，流露在每個初睹海　的壯士面孔，這是航行第二天。</p>
<p>讚美，歌頌，經過了十個　　間，大家又覺得有些孤寂了，正在這時候，遼遠的西北海面，露出了一個黑點點，船上司令塔的燈號，馬上開始和那個黑點點聯絡，經過了半個鐘頭的時光，一艘美國中型軍艦，靠近我們，接着在前方領導航行。不久，後面又來了一艘，於是一個在前，一個在後，執行護航工作，航行隊伍組成了人，人感到了莫大歡欣。</p>
<p>黃昏，後面軍艦，遠離他去，大家對於昨天受到的風浪威脅，都有戒心，有的少吃飯，有的老早躺下來，大的，僅有前後上下的震盪，沒有左右的搖襬，原因是船向北行，起的是迎頭北來的風浪，所以都幸免再度遭受磨難了。</p>
<p>一夜附睡，老天已經換了一個陰沉面貌，令人感覺有些抑鬱，靑年軍弟兄們，在船上受了些排連敎練，免得浪費了時光，課程完了，多在甲板依　憑眺，船過處，碧水沸騰般向上翻滾，遠方則波濤洶湧，覆蓋了整個的地面，此外就是天空雲影和數十低飛的海鷗了。</p>
<p>天越發陰得沉重，夜裏　落了小雨，浪頭也越發大起來，仍是迎面襲擊，前後跳動頗烈，船已進渤海峽了，大家也有些習慣了海上生活，所以沒有太大的不舒服。</p>
<p>早晨，滿火大霧，船又轉為左右傾斜，所幸霧散天晴，太陽出來了，擺動逐漸低落下來。九點多鐘，前面護航軍艦，和我們告別，轉往大沽方向，因爲秦皇島已在望，它的護航任務完成了。</p>
<p>海水已由青綠轉爲淡綠，秦皇島　山，向我們應來，海港已清晰可見了。港口排列着十數艘軍艦和運輸船隻，火車站，玻璃廠，鐵工廠，電燈廠，市區房屋，都擺在了大家眼前。</p>
<p>港口山明水秀，碼頭伸入海面，幾艘大船，靠攏載煤列車，起載從唐山運來的煤，運往上海等處。工廠的烟囟，冒着黑烟，機車吼聲，此伏彼起，火車和碼頭電車，來往港口間，大家感到了莫大興奮與愉快。載靑年軍北來的第七一四號登陸艦，在大家歡呼聲中，靠攏碼頭，時間是廿四日上午十一時正。</p>
<p>秦皇島的繁榮，大部份依靠着碼頭，開澯煤礦，把這作一吐出口，其他待開的還有鐵和砒七等礦。此外，在工業方面，有「　光玻璃廠」，出品暢銷華北，人多讚許。另有鐵工廠，係屬煤礦和嚴格用作修理機械的塲所。</p>

<h3>美準備於必要時　武力制止侵略　未經同意無權駐軍他國　不容任何一國獨霸世界</h3>
<p>貝爾納斯發言強有力之演說</p>
<p>美國務　貝爾納期於二十八日在華盛頓海外新聞總會向全世界發表强有力之演說。全文長約五千　，歸　之可如下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）準備於必要時，以武力制止侵略。</p>
<p>（二）美蘇之間，唯有鑄成不可原諒之大錯，始足以引起嚴重衝突。</p>
<p>（三）任何國家未得批准或同意，無權駐軍於其他獨立國家之領土內。</p>
<p>（四）任何强國，在被解放之國家或曾附敵之國家內，不能擅將敵產取為已有。</p>
<p>（五）不各任何一國獨霸世界。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕只爾納斯所闡明之嚴厲外交新政策，實已預示美國將就歐亞兩洲衝要地區之紅軍佈防事，對莫斯科作最後之解決。更已表明美國對於功聯在解放各國擅取財產之政策，將取嚴峻之直接對付辦法。此間一般人士咸認貝爾納斯在紐約之宣言，乃美政府對蘇政策之先聲。</p>
<h3>貝氏演詞全文</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿八日電〔國務卿貝爾納斯今晚在此問海外新聞總會發表演辭，全文如下：</p>
<p>怎樣確保和平</p>
<p>我們已開始明瞭戰爭已過去了，兒子，丈夫和父親都回家來了，翻開報紙來，再也不怕我們親戚家人的名字會發現在死亡的名單中，這是何等好的事情。但是現在還不是完全慶祝和快活的時期，鄕村和城市中的家庭，常他們吃過晚飯以後聽孩子們追述諾曼第和琉璜島戰事的時候，他們每個人的心中，還有一個沒有說出來的問題。這一個問題，就是我們怎樣才可以確定、永遠不再會有戰爭？過去在戰爭期內，我們的目標是很淸楚的，我們的目標是勝利。固然：工業動員和軍事動員是最重大的問題，生產的僵局時常似乎無法打開，運輸的困難和人力的缺乏，似乎不能克服，在前綫，陸海空的聯合作戰的錯綜複雜的行動，使人聞之寒心。這些都是艱苦的工作，然而我們只要問一問：「這對於勝利有帮助嗎？」勝利的共同目標使我們團結起來，使我們的努力有了目的和領導。</p>
<p>現在我們已到了風平浪靜的境地，我們的舒暢和感激是與不安的心情混雜在一起的。我們現在的目標是永久和平，我們追求永久和平，甚至比我們以前爭取勝利更加急切，困難是永久和平的路沒有像勝利的路那樣容易看見和容易找尋。我們遇到任何一個問題，第一須要問：「這對於和平有帮助嗎？」如果這問題的答案來得很緩，或甚至沒有答案，那末我們就開始不安和恐懼起來了。我們雖然有許多事情疑慮不明，但是有幾個基本約定理，我們是很淸楚的。</p>
<p>兩個基本定理</p>
<p>一個是勝利的結果不一定就是公正而永久的和平？不過勝利已使我們有建立這一種和平的機曾，我們的生命就緊於我們是否能充分利用這一個機會。</p>
<p>還有一件事是我們所確知的：就是我們美國人單獨無法確定世界是否將在和平中生活下去，還是將在戰爭中毀滅掉？和平不是單靠我們，也要靠別人，沒有一個國家是命運的完全的主人，我們都是彼此禍福相共的。</p>
<p>因為我們知道了這一點，所以我們已把我們的希望繫在聯合國的旗幟上面。我們不能因為加入了這一個組織而就以為滿足，我們知道我們雖然把世界的夢想寄托於聯合國，但是除非各個會員國有信念和決心，使聯合國有生命而對於具體的案件和一切日常事務都能發揮作用，否則聯合國也將失敗。</p>
<h3>不得對方允許　無權駐軍他國</h3>
<p>關於聯合國首次幾個會議，各代表所發表的，都是坦白而率直的言論，這些初次會議目的，僅爲設立聯合國的各個機構，但是提交安全理事會討論的那些問題中，有幾個非常迫切，甚至在理事會有機會採用臨時規則和程序之前，就需要予以解決。</p>
<p>在倫敦幾次會議的進行，並不是完全安靜而和平的，有人企圖利用聯合國來促進自私的國家的目標，但是在倫敦辯論巾所反映的國家利益和目標的衝突，很像我們全國和各州立法巾所反映的地方和特殊利益的衝突。我們當然不贊成這些利益的衝突，但是旣然有了這些衝突，那末最好應該開誠佈公約發表出來，如果這些利益的衝突不在聯合國的討論會中提出來，那末這些討論會也將失去其效用而結果變成徒然的了。</p>
<p>當叙利亞和黎巴嫩政府提出控訴，請求英法軍隊從它們的領土上撤退回去，而安全理事會對此控訴討論完畢的時侯，已經創立了一個極重要的先例，理事會不曾採取正式行動，這是因爲永久會員國對次議的形式意見紛歧，但是始終沒有一個國家懷疑這個一般命題：即任何國家不得對方允許，無權留駐軍隊在對方那個獨立國家的領土中，把這個命題應用到上述懸案一節，也沒有任何國反對。美國代表斯退丁紐斯依照這個意思所提出的特殊解次方式，受到理事會大多數會員國的擁護，然而終於未被接受，因為蘇聯認爲不够明確，予以否次。但英法政府立即宣稱：不管蘇聯技術上的否次權，它們也一定要遵照美國次議而行，因爲這個次議明晰的代表理事會的意見。</p>
<p>這足以表明單有理事會的一個永久會員國提川法理上的否次權，在事實上，任何國家，無論是大國或小國，遵照聯合國憲章的目的與原則而行的道德上的責任，是不能因之解除的。</p>
<p>聯合國已經有了一個好的開頭，然而這並不是說它的成功已經有了保證，這意思只是說：倘使聯合國人民次心要使聯合國憲章生效，那它就會生效。</p>
<p>堅守憲章信約</p>
<p>有時我國國會也犯有過與不及的嚴重錯誤，這種錯誤並非國會本身制度的錯過，這是議員或它的構成分子的錯過，因為他們沒有克盡他們的責任。</p>
<p>聯合國機構也是這樣，只有我們，聯合國人民，都能克盡我們的責任的時侯，它才會成功。</p>
<p>如果我對諸位說今天的世界情况是健全的或可以放懷的，那我是不够坦自，我們的週圍還有猜疑和不信任，它們反轉過來又孕育着猜疑和不信任。</p>
<p>我們已經共立信的除保衛具體規定在「憲章」標和宗旨內的法律外，不使用武力。我們誠心守此信約，但是我們旣是一大强國及安全理事會的常任理事，我們當然有責任以我們的力量使其他國家共守此約，我們也願意負起這一責任，除非各强國都準備爲保衛法律而行動，聯合國是不能防止戰爭的，我們必須在事前明白表示我們的確要爲防止侵略而行動，同時再明自表示我們將不為其他的而用武力。</p>
<p>各强國都被授予特殊的責任，因為它們如果願意維持和平，他們是有力量來維持和平的，這種各國間力量比重，是他們定中任何一國要破壞和平·假使其他各國能團結一致保衛憲章，那也還是不能輕易破壞的。目前各强國間的力量比重，足以防止他們中任何一國獨霸世界，這種力量的比重不能由任何一個强國的片面行動而實際使之改變，否則必將極端紊亂聯合國的整個機構。因此，我們假使要盡我們的本份來維持和平，我們必須保持我們的力量來這樣做，我們並且要明白表示我們在與保衛憲章中一定和其他强國團結一致。</p>
<p>假使我們要做一個很大的强國，我們的作為要像一個很大的强國，這樣不但可保證我們本身的安全並且可以保持世界的和平。</p>
<h3>保持武裝力量　決非從事侵略</h3>
<p>我們雖然渴望普遍解除武裝，我們雖然準備參加普遍遍縮軍，但是如果我們單獨除去軍備，我們便不能信守我們對自身和世界的責任。保持大量職業化的當備軍，雖然和我們的傳統不合，但我們必須能够而且準備供給在短期內便能集合的武裝部隊，我們必須同時有受過訓練的許多公民，能够而且準備補充這些武裝部隊，世需再有不必要的長期訓練。為了和平我們不能允許我們的軍事配備減縮到和我們的任務不相稱的地步，而且我們必須有某種形式的普遍軍訓，其故在此。</p>
<p>我們這樣保持的力量不能也不會用來從事侵略，我們作為一個愛好和平，守法和傳統足以保證我們的武力不會因保衛法律以外的目的而使用，我們的軍隊除非由安全理事會召令出　，要用之於戰爭，必須先得國會的同意。我們不必恐懼它的濫用，除非我們不信任人民的代表。</p>
<p>我深信在任何强國間現在並沒有戰爭的理由，目前的力量比重和利害關係是這樣的，就是只要每一個國家忠實信守憲章的目標和原則，任何國家都勿需也應該覺得他在和別國的關係中有何不安全之感。</p>
<p>光是各國宣布他們並不需要製造戰爭是不够的，希特勒這樣說過，在某種意義上說，他的意思是這樣的，他要全世界接受一個由他指揮的全體主義政府的主宰，假使可能的話，他想不經過戰爭而達到這個目的，假使必要的話，他決定用戰爭來達到它。</p>
<p>要放棄戰爭，各國必須不去做導向戰爭的事。</p>
<p>外交具建設性</p>
<p>美國在內政或對外關係的政策上從來沒有承認現狀是神聖不可侵犯的，我們的民主的要義是我們相信生活和生長，相信人民有權去造成他們自已的將來，我們的傳統不是保衛反動的「武斷」和特權的專橫，我們和納粹及法西斯黨徒作戰是因為這些黨徒想使文明的時鐘逆轉過來，使我們停止前進。</p>
<p>我們的外交必須不是消極的，怠惰的，它必須能調整和發展，以適合不斷改變的環境，它必須有創造性的觀念，建設性的提議，實際的以及有遠見的建議，雖然維持現狀並不是神聖和不可變易的，我們也不能忽視一種片面的對現狀的剝蝕。聯合國憲章禁止侵略，我們不能允許藉威逼壓迫或者如政治滲透等詭計來進行侵略。</p>
<p>當大小國家間須有所調整時，我們要坦白地公平地就事論事，考慮調整辦法，要顧計到所有大小國家的利益，以維持這個基於各大强國團結而不爲任何一國獨占的世界中之和平與安全。</p>
<p>毫無疑問，各國間現正有着非常重要的調整事項要求我們考慮，有些局勢在處理時極爲　妙，但是，只要這種在全世界各地爲取得戰略優勢而用的手段，以及利用第一個調整為模人的開始而繼續發揮暗中伸展的實力之類的方法終止進行，我相信還是可以找到滿意解次的。</p>
<p>我們必須面對一個事實，就是我們要保持「聯合國」，不能對存在於任何强國間的嚴重糾紛淡然置之，不論是否要行使否決　，因為導　糾紛能够影響所有强國間整個力量的比重。（下文轉入第三版）</p>
<h3>和平尚未到來　美必須保持實力</h3>
<p>陸長柏德　繼貝爾納斯濱說</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿八日電〕貝爾納斯演說後，陸長柏德遜繼之發言稱：美國人民須謹記和平尙未到來，全世界尙有許多重大之軍事冒險。美國應維持實力强大訓練有素之後備兵，並須統一各部隊，及從事科學研究與科學發展之積極計劃。軟弱不足以謀解決，適足遭人輕蔑。我人過去曾蹈此　，結果不得不一再被迫參戰。參議院原子委員會主席麥克馬洪嗣亦宣稱：美國未能將原子能管理權由軍人移交民事機關，不啻向世界舉起原子軍備競爭之信號。目前原子能軍管理情形如繼續保持，則從事原子核研究之科學人員，勢必棄之若凂，國外方面亦將認此爲美國寬容原子軍備競爭之徴象。</p>
<h3>協約國分派　德國賠償品</h3>

<h3>科學與愛國精神的實踐家　張莘夫在回憶裏</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>經濟部代理東北特派員張莘夫先生接收撫順煤礦未遂，在返回瀋陽的途中，突被匪徒拖下車來，剝去衣服，用刺刀戳死，共殺四十八刀。隨員七人，同時遇害，死狀之慘，見者掩泣，聞者酸鼻。記者與莘夫為素職，在接到他的死訊以後，曾寫一信致張夫人李薌蘅女士叩詢張烈士死事及其子女狀况，信末綴以「撫順」一頁，草木含悲，東北不亡，烈士永生」等語，以表悼念。關於撫順礦區生產及莘夫生平，曾略載本報南京專電，規在再就記者所知，縷述萃夫之為人，藉抒哀思。</p>
<p>他人望而却步　烈士勇往直前</p>
<p>張烈士，年約五十二歲，原籍東北，曾在英美諸國研究鑛冶有年。回國後，先在吉林，經營鑛業。一度至撫順　區實行考察。東北淪陷前後，曾兩次在河北河南省境，從事鑛業之開採工作。我國科學工業落後，尤其因鑛業設備簡陋，管理困難，每使很多優秀的工微家望而却步，加之過去我國的一班政治家，金融家，以及智識份子，對那些困守於試騐室裏的工鑛研究人員以及櫛風沐雨披星戴月深入攀荒與一切不幸災難搏鬥的工程家，探鑛家，當其艱難奮鬥，需要同情鼓勵需要協助的時期，大都是不甚理會，或甚至漠然視之，及至偶然看到一二功成業立的工鑛巨子，則又恭維奉承，惟恐不及，然考其動機，多半似乎是為了拉生意，荐生意。據莘夫生前吿我：這兩個階段，他都曾親身經騐過來。</p>
<p>兩頓苦飯度日　不憚牛衣對泣</p>
<p>烈士在華北開鑛失敗的時候，窮到一天以兩頓「窩窩頭」度活，夫婦兩口子牛衣對泣，還是以愈挫愈奮的勇氣，繼續苦幹下去。他們夫妾年紀相差有限，但是在四年以前張夫人的樣子，已經老得像一個七十歲的老太太了。抗戰以後，政府為了加强國內及盟邦的軍需工業，曾於湘西晃縣設立一個汞業管理處，大規模開發湘西川東以及黔東南的硃砂水銀鑛。大約在民國三十年，烈士就來到晃縣擔任這汞鑛「管理處長。經他兩年當中不斷的努力，頓使那埋藏在川、湘、黔三省邊陲山嶽地區的那些亮晶晶的東西，一顆一顆的都成了我們換取外匯的法寳。原來三數十個職工幹的事情，必須要幾千人來幹了。汞業管理處連雲的巨　也在那荒僻的先縣出現了。</p>
<p>貴爲汞鑛處長　只租三間平房</p>
<p>相當於一個國家銀行經理地位的汞業管理處長，他只租了附近民家的三間平房，過着一種極平淡而自然的生活。我跟他就是在是縣認識的，而見面的地方也就是在那三間平房裏。那是民國卅一年冬季的事。這是一個寒冷而又恐怖的冬天。然在這年冬殘臘盡，湘黔邊區的少數殘匪糾集了一些莠民，由晃縣　花地帶竄到貴州邊境的小靑溪。（原為靑溪縣，現改鎭屬鎭遠。）貴州有句俗諺，叫做「天乾謠言多，」在交通不便的地方非當流行。有一次，土匪攻陷了幾個縣城。當時人心惶惶，莫知所措，記者爲了想獵取點眞實消息，作新聞報道的資料，特地由芷江趕到晃縣，向汞鑛處借汽車，預備深入匪區，看他一個究竟。</p>
<p>爲求工人安全　冒險深入匪窟</p>
<p>想不到莘夫要和我一同去。　的理由是：小靑溪的鐵獷，是汞業管理處試辦的。他很擔心鐵鑛廠裏的職工們的安全，終於在安慰鐵廠職工眷屬之後，英勇地跟記者同車，趕到了匪區。</p>
<p>當記者跨上汽車以前，張夫人曾一再叮囑我們，要當天回來。莘夫的四位男女公子也帶着一點惶駭的神氣，向他們的爸爸揚手，不約而同的喊一聲：「爸爸，快點回來啊！」好運氣　那次是如願以償，回來了。然而，這次却一去不回了！</p>
<p>烈士精神感召　土匪不忍開槍</p>
<p>嗚呼！誰無父母？誰無妻兒？同是飽嘗戰禍的人類，何必下這樣的毒手？我眞不忍追述那時張夫人在看到我們由小靑溪回來時的那種歡喜的姿態了！</p>
<p>靑溪之行，在當時倒並不覺得怎樣危險，因為到了玉屏縣時，聽說匪已退却，後來據投識的匪徒說：他們在山裏曾經看到鑛廠的汽車，因爲他們曉得開鑛，對老百姓是有利的，加之聽說張處長人好，不忍開槍，這話有幾分可信。本來莘夫爲人不錯，所以富土匪的也能有天良發現的時候！</p>
<p>土劣切齒懷恨　翁氏破涕爲笑</p>
<p>民國三十二年，記者有西北之行。不久莘夫亦謂任贛南，主持粵贛邊區鎢砂鑛區，這是莘夫經歷中國工鑛家第二個階段的時期。大概為了一部鑛權利益，莘夫主張應把利益歸於國家，因此惹惱了幾位土劣，竟向參政會狠狠的吿了一狀。那時，翁詠霓先生曾急得大跳其脚說：「這樣的人再靠不住，這世界不知要弄成什麼樣子了！我很傷心，我很傷心！可是後來，經過若干監察機關查明以後，莘夫之受誣，眞相大白。翁先生破涕為笑，鷙情的握住莘夫的手連聲的說：「莘夫！你眞是任勞任怨，不忮不求，淸淸白白的公務員！不要灰心！好好幹下去！中國有了是與非，國家是有前途的！」聽說，莘夫這次奉派前往東北，臨行前曾向翁部長託妻寄子，可知他確是死且不懼而辛苦更無足辭的漢子。</p>
<p>他在靑溪道上，曾向記者說過：「如果我們不能收回那一塊面積一·三〇三·一四三·二五二立方公里的土地，我們那些窮苦的人們，就得一輩子窮苦了，與其這樣下去，我寗願死在東北！」鳴呼，一語成讖，太傷心了！但願他睜大眼睛，看着那塊遲早必可完全收復的土地吧！</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯之强有力演詞</h3>
<p>世界不容分解</p>
<p>（上文接第二版）美國希望維持和所有國家的友善關係，但不希望和任何國家有排他性的協定。自然，有些問題對某些國家較之對其他國家關係更大。對許多和美洲各國間有關係的問題，情形就是如此。對德日的管制亦然，在我們和其他强國的關係中有許多問題與我們中二三國的關係較諸他人為大。我並沒有看到對三强，四强或五强間的會議有何反對。即使是我們自己單獨和蘇聯，和英國，和法國或中國的會議也能帮助推進强國問的協調和與小國間的和平，但即使在這些會議中，就美國而言，我們決不結黨營私對付任何國家。我們將不去割裂全世界成為各別的集團或勢力範圍，在這個原子時代，我們決不會設法分解這個單一而不可分的世界。</p>
<p>我們公開地，愉快地，和竭誠地歡迎我們的蘇聯盟邦成為一個不在任何國之下的大强國。我們曾多次遷就它的意見，贊同許多調整辦法，並且在這樣的過程中，消除不少嚴重的疑慮，設法對它有利。唯有不可恕饒的錯誤悲　，才能够使彼此在未來發生嚴重的衝突。雖然我們的生活方式不同，我們人民羨慕和尊重我們的盟友，並希望在自由日益擴張生活水準日益提高的世界巾，繼續成為友人和伙伴。</p>
<p>憲章不容破壞</p>
<p>爲了世界和平，和我們彼此共同的傳統的友誼起見，我們必須明白宣吿美國將保衛聯合國憲章。大小國家都已同意根據聯合國憲章，除却爲了保衛法律同憲章的目的和精神，不援用武力或以武力相威脅。</p>
<p>倘有人藉武力或以試力相威脅，以達到與聯合國憲章精神相違的目的，我們不願亦不能袖手旁觀。除非我們獲得其他主權國白由的認可，我們沒有權利在它們的領土範圍內駐紥軍隊。我們不應過分延長促現和平的時間，並且繼續强駐我們的軍隊在弱小和貧困的國家境內。在盟國對賠償問題取得協議之前，任何國家都沒有權利把解放區威從前敵人附庸國內的敵產任意據爲已有。我們沒有也不能同意任何一國自行決定它從這些國家拿走什麼東西，我們不應該發動神經戰以達到戰略上的目的，我們不願意糊里糊塗地陷於這樣的一個局面，就是沒有一國願意戰爭，但是也沒有一國能够避免戰爭。我們不應該認為喚起對上述可能危及和平局勢的注意，就是對那應該負責的國家或一些國家構成一種侮辱</p>
<p>任何國家都可能出於它的善意採取某種行動而不充分認識這種行動的後果，我們應該願意檢討我們自身的行動，藉以保持我們在和平中的共同利益，因為這對於我們是遠較足令我們分裂的爭執為重要。</p>
<p>我們應該恢復和平時期的情形，我們必須淸除戰爭所留給我們的可怕遺物，我們應讓我們的軍隊各自歸返它們的故土，我們必須廓淸製造猜疑和恐懼的塲合，我們不應自欺，和誤引我們的盟國入於歧途，為了避免糾紛，我們不應讓局勢演變成為不可收拾的事變。</p>
<p>我們應該恪遵聯合國憲章，這是獲致和平的唯一途徑，我們要迎守憲章，大家應一致懷有善意和互相諒解。</p>
<p>共建快樂世界</p>
<p>我們這些在戰爭最黑暗時期具有耐心和激發彼此自信心的國家，現在也應該具有耐心和激發彼此的自信。</p>
<p>沒有一國可以專有人類的智慧，也沒有一國可以自認有權便行動起來，友邦的行爲應該友邦化才對。</p>
<p>不負責任地談論戰爭的不可避免性，等於對我們是否効忠憲章發生懷疑，並且侵害着我們在國內或國外最珍視的自由。</p>
<p>世界上有許多主義上的歧異，這是向來有的，但是以世界之大，儘可以容納許多意見不同的人民和許多制度不同的政府。</p>
<p>沒有一個人可以預測遼遠的未來，和最後的情勢如何，但是我們作為一共同文化的一部分，是緊緊地繫在一起了。</p>
<p>我們縱觀戰爭破壞的結果，我們應瞭解戰後建設和創立人民較高生活水準的困難工作，需要我們全力以赴。</p>
<p>所有大小國家，應該協力建設一個更友好和更快樂的世界，我們若不能共同努力，則我們任何人都不能獲得和平和安寗，而前途也沒有多大希望。（完）</p>
<h3>社論　國民黨二中全會的召開</h3>
<p>中國國民黨第六屆中央委員第二次全體會議，業於昨日揭幕於陪都。此一會議之召開，為國民黨領導全民抗戰獲致勝利後之首次會議，值政治協商圓滿閉幕之後，當結束訓政實施憲政之前夕，其意義百至重大。繼往開來，本次會議的成就，無疑地在國民黨的歷史上將是　期的。中國之民族解放運動與國民黨結着歷史的深緣，國民黨的消長贏弱關係中國之民族前　者實深且巨。茲當其舉行比劃期的會義之際，　　致言，用為　賀。</p>
<p>中國國民黨目前站在一　　史的轉折點，此後國民黨行進的方向如何，舉措如何，不特關係國民黨本身的榮枯，抑且有　民族的盛衰。今日抗戰勝利，而　前的危機，或更甚於　昔，盱衡國內外局勢，問題　　，暗礁處處；春　一現而陰　又集，勝利在握而　難未紓。如何打開目前局勢，使國家步入復興建設之路，是固全民有責而中國國民黨為目今第一大黨，　負責任，尤不在小。今國民黨中央委員集議於陪部　願就觀感所及。約略有所論列。</p>
<p>一，關於國民黨本身之問題，值此實施憲政之　　，　有多端，亟待商討決定。准其中有兩點，其重要性亦不容忽視：（一）為如何整飭黨的風紀問題，（二）為如何運用新的動力問題。今日中國人民頗多對國民黨存有不良觀感；推厥原因，往往由於各地國民黨負責人員行為失檢，恃勢凌人，以致人心向背。國民黨今後如欲獲取人心，必須力改近年來之頹風，而如何整飭黨員風紀，尤為當務之急。一個政黨原由無數黨員組成；分子一多，良莠不齊，勢所難免。國民黨內儘多忠貞之士，祇要有若干敗類存在，就足以破壞國民黨的聲譽而有餘。國民黨「整風運動」的展開，實屬刻不容緩。就積極方面言，國民黨在其過去五十年中，每當歷史階段，輒能發揮其最大力量。辛亥的顚覆淸室，與民國十五年的國民革命，均為劃期的民族解放運動，國民黨均能把握時機，達成其所負任務。現在又是一個歷史階段的開端，而現在的客觀形勢與從前的逈然不同；如何運用新的動力以發揮國民黨的力量，如前所述，不特關係國民黨本身的榮枯，抑且有關民族的盛衰。淸室的顚覆，主要由於各地的志士及滿懷民族思想的學人；國民革命的高潮，正値五四新文化運動以後，此兩階段動力的運用，已有不同。現値建國之會，國民黨必須運用一種新的動力，方能繼續發揚已往的光輝。</p>
<p>第二，關於政治方而之問題，為如何實施三民主義與五權憲法。查三民主義爲我國建國最高指導原則，原為各黨各派所接受，則如何實行三民主義五權憲法，本應不成問題。可是這次政協會議所成立的協議，頗有違反三民主義及五權憲法的精神的；如關於五院制嫂及省的地位者均是。五權憲政為國父給予中國人民之一大遺產，條列謹嚴，其目的在挽救西洋議會政治之弊，爲三民主義立一健全政治體制，不容誤會曲解。此次政協會議對憲草所為之協議，將三民主義所欲建立的政治體制予以支離宰割；若果付諸實施，將使五十年來國民黨的努力，盡付東流。此其危機，實遠甚於民元時代袁氏之陰謀。至於提高省的地位，使省有省憲，實爲變相的地方割據，尤為中國人民所反對。查美國各州之有憲法，原有歷史的背景；美國的聯邦政府係由各州集合而成。我國的情形不同，原係中央統一的政制，不容離心分割，致重演地方割據的局面。中國人民值長期戰爭之後，亟欲有安定的秩序，俾有休養生息的機會；所以他們對於政治體制問題，至爲關切。</p>
<p>此次國民黨中央委員集會於陪都，希望能於接受政協成果之中，保全三民主義的精神。民族前途，胥利賴之。</p>
<h3>讀者意見　何不「借頭」平價</h3>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>黃金漲似以後，百物均隨之上升，而民生主要品之食米，竟後來居上，於三天之內上漲一倍，且有叩破三萬大關，繼續高昇之勢，黃金非日用必需品，漲價表而，似與民生無關。而食米一項，則為民食必需，當此工潮迭起，社會極度不安之際，若再任其暴漲不已，則國事民生，均將不堪設想！</p>
<p>政府對穩定金融，平抑物價想必在周詳策劃之中；但急驚風慢郎中的結果，亦可能使病人送命，而當局對抑平米價，進而抑平物價，似乎尙無適當之處置辦法，此不免令人有「慢郎中」「送命」之感！</p>
<p>吾人對此番米價暴漲之癥結，似乎已瞭然為人為之主因，則吾人實願望當局能迅即採用斷然手段，效法桂林市長「借頭抑平米價」的成規來仿行一番，使今日「一路哭一家笑」之局面，變為「一家哭一路笑」，實為當前之德政，亦為今日對物價之唯一急救良策。</p>
<p>當民國卅二年季秋，廣西桂林市之米價，暴漲五成，當局雖多方設法而無法抑制。最後得市長蘇新民一篇書面談話，而竟吿收效。談話中的大意，為官可以不做，米價不能不平，市長將與奸商拚命，而採用借頭平價了！雖然頭並未借到而奸商終於知難而止，米價果然平了下去！</p>
<p>事急矣！願當局一試，以解吾民之倒懸，實爲無量功德！</p>

<h3>大批船隻將自美國運來　捕漁艦隊組成我國不難爲遠東漁業領袖</h3>

<h3>社會服務　市面漲風敉平　商店標價依然不减</h3>
<p>值得注意的民生問題</p>
<p>編輯先生：鄙人提出一個條關民生的迫切問題，請在「社會服務」欄刋出，自勝利以來，不這半年，民生愈見困苦，社會秩序，擾亂不寧，雖說原因複雜，但當局對金融物資管制無方，聽其洪水橫流，自也不能辭其咎。其次，是商人自私自利，不顧大衆生活，任意高招物價，也是主要的原因。舉個例說：前幾天黃金米價及各種主要物品，一度飛漲，市面混亂，不可終日，幸而　蔣主席回渝後，決定管制外匯的辦法宣段後，各種主要物品，皆相率回跌三四成，然而市塲上次要的民主日用品，依然未見减低，只要留心各商號櫥窗內的標價，就可以明白。例如革芏店前在黃金每兩十三萬白米每石一萬餘的辰光，小牛皮像皮底皮鞋一雙，標價七千餘，後因黃金白米飛漲，該店則將標價招高至二萬元左右，（漲一倍以上）今則黃金白米回跌至原數，而皮鞋仍售兩萬閏未回到七千餘元，此種冷血的自私自利的奸商，神經過敏，最後聽物價漲風，便連忙把標價提高，一漲再漲，從沒有跌價的日子，他們此操縱物資的投機商還要吃血，困此我請求與論界起來糾正，並督促警察局社會局速組經濟警察，來監視密查，並定公平的價格，限令各商號遵守法紀，其目的在於防止奸商的暴利，解除民生的痛苦，我這代表民衆的意見，想先生不會見棄的吧！唐志軍上。</p>

<h3>游資逢低吸收　金價後盤回漲　美鈔供多價跌</h3>
<p>赤人心忐忑，一般心理鑒於中行下週一實行　貿外匯，短期內金市勢必受其約束，投機家熱中暴利，此後將無機可乘，紛紛顧而之他，執貨者亦有脫貨套利者，證券帮對同業公會理事集會，寄予深切期望，午後脫金抵補股票收貨頭寸，但雜行游資認為回落已鉅，不乏見低活動者，是以最開後自一四五萬逐步小挫，午後一度破人一三〇萬大開，不旋踵仍能回好至一四左右，銀樓已恢復掛牌，惟售價離市價過遠，每兩約高起一萬餘元，一般游資遂競向黑市中收羅，是以結果尚　前收漲二萬，飾金掛牌自十五萬元退至十四萬五，最後仍為十五萬元，紋銀降為一千八，銀元跌風　止，在八百元左右，暗拆　一角八至二角四。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔亦先穩　疲，中行公開賣買之期迫近，外幣現鈔根據海關公告受限制出入之致命打擊，執有者鑒於此次所公佈外匯賣買辦法，極為週密，現貨在不久之將來，將逐步被淘汰，大量實貨　出，投機歛迹下，供過於求，失其均衡，是以晨開二〇〇〇元左右後，一度喊高至二〇五〇元，即遭賣方　倒，且二千元關亦不易保持，近午在一九七〇元盤旋，午後隨黃金下游，會破入一九〇〇元大關，最後又被黃金帶上，結果較前收再跌三十元，　票亦難免例外，執有者仍有大量搜出，以致老貨跌三十元，新貨尚有人逢賤吸收，僅跌三元，美鈔　黃金又拔開至七一〇元對十兩，輕鈔觀念復瀎。</p>

<p>公　叨華洋股票之光，散戶因賤吸　，丙種自　開一七五〇元拔高至一九〇〇元，午收一八五〇元有賣，過程平庸，較前收計　　好半成，熱門一成左右，華股仍形逼近，漲後亦轉入盤境，惟各處喊價頗有參差，業中除利用自動電　外，別無他法可以連絡，是以各自為政，同一時間內極難作準備之估計，結果再好半成至一成不等，外股上塲即鋒芒　　，證券業理事會午後集議復業辦法，外商亦來捧塲，結果再好一成至一成半。</p>
<h3>紗花布均疲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市直綫下降，數日來因外匯開放消息傳出後，人心即入萎　不振狀態中，加以隔昨銀根突然抽緊客銷因天雨綿綿而趨沉寂，廿支各紗俱已　入百萬關內，小型紗慘跌至八十萬左右，與十六支價不相上下，綜觀各支紗綫，普遍跌落一成之　。</p>

<h3>評張東蓀著「知識與文化」</h3>
<p>— 傅統先</p>
<p>出版者　商務印書館</p>
<p>日期　三十五年一月初版</p>
<p>定價　一〇〇〇元</p>
<p>數　二七七頁</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>張先生這本「知識與文化」是我國學術界値得珍貴的一本書，從他自己的語氣之中，可以看得出這也是著者得意之作。所以我們敢向讀者鄭重的介紹。這本書完成於二十九年的四月。當時張先生曾來信告訴我說這書不久即可出版。本願先賭爲快，但一直隔了六年才得見面，所以又可說是相見恨晚了。</p>
<p>這本書是申述張先生在知識論上的主張。關於這一方面，我曾和張先生作過好幾次的討論，雙方的見解很不容易一教。例如張先生在二十三年出版的認識論（世界出版）中主張認識的多元論，我有許多不能同意的地方，曾寫過一篇『認識是多元還是一元？」的文章批評他（見詹文滸編張東蓀的多元認識論）。後來又讀到他的「多元認識論重述」（二十六年一月出版張菊生先生七十生日紀念論文集），雖有所修正，但仍覺不甚痛快。此次張先生的知識論另外換了一副新的面目出現。其中有了相當重要的改變，而與我的意見非常的接近，因此，這一次讀到張先生的文章，其中意味覺得特別親近，好些話正就是我想說的話。所以我想在本文內把張先生最近的主張作一個領單的介紹，然後申述我個人見到張光生思想上所產生的變化後所發生的幾點意見。</p>
<p>本書目的在於建立一個獨立的知識論，尤其要說明知識和文化的關係。張先生的主張名爲「多元交互作用論」，這裏面張先生要說明兩重的交互作用。第一種交互作用是就知識本身的結構而言，即表明感覺，知覺，概念，和外在的架構四者是互相作用的。第二重的交互作用是表明知識和文化二者是互相作用的，知識受文化的限制，文化亦受思想的影響。全書共分三部分：（一）從知識而說到文化，分析知識的性質，以表明知識即是文化；（二）從文化而說到知識，說明理論知識之形成如何受文化的限制；（三）論中國思想的特徵，藉以舉實證明知識與民族文化的關係，</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>第一部分是說明知識的性組。人類的知識是一種極共複雜的組織。其間可以分析成爲四個質織的因素：（一）在外的相關者；（二）感覺；（三）知覺；（四）槪念。它們「乃是互相倚靠的，互相浸透的，互相限制的，互相左右的，互相影響的。」第一，外在者是在知識組織中所必須承認者，因爲假使沒有外在者，那末何以我們的感覺會有種種的變化，便無從解釋。至於這個「外在者」到底是甚麼，我們在知識論的範圍裏面最好是不贊一辭，因爲我們說話越多，則離開這個「外在者」越遠，越不會弄明白。所以張先生說：「我們不得已只有以承認爲止，不再進而求說明。」</p>
<p>第二，感覺是指我們直接的見聞。但感覺不祇是一稱單純的反映，而乃是一種混合物（東蓀先生名之曰「造成者」）。感覺上所現的，例如顏色，都不是眞有這樣東西，而只是由於混合而成功的結果。心「只是一連串而級級增高的綜合之作用。」感覺乃是心對外在者最低級的綜合作用所造成的結果。在直接的見聞中仍少不了有辨別作用。誠如康德所云：「感受而無審辦則盲；審辨而無感受則空。」</p>
<p>第三，知覺乃是就親見的全境而言。知覺把感覺配在一個全境中而成功一個「面觀」。知覺有三個特點。（一）知覺是由幾個感覺所組織成功的，如距離的知覺便是由視覺和運動感覺所配合成功的。（二）知覺中除感覺外另有「想像」加入其中。（三）感覺只供給知覺以材料，而知覺却自有其全境。所以知覺也是一種「造成者」。</p>
<p>第四，概念是由知覺漸進而來的。照張先生的主張，「槪念之起源是由於具體事物的影相之逐漸淡薄而變爲記號，復由記號的移用而致於普通，乃有所謂「共相」。但這種槪念的由來不完全限於知覺上的具體物件，而更重要者尚有來自具體物件間的關係者。當這些可能的關係化爲槪念時乃有邏輯性質的概念。這種概念都可變爲範疇。而範疇的出現和文化的形成只是一件事。某種文化包括某種範疇。因此，概念又說是某種文化的表現。</p>
<p>至於講到「心」，它「只是一個動作而已，其動作的結果，就是一層一層地構造出來。每一層造成者都有牠的特別功用。所以由直接親見到間接思辨實在沒有分界，乃只是一貫地構造下去而已。」但是在各層之間郤有一個定律：即後起的綜合必包括以前的綜合，下一層反爲上一層所吸收，故部分對於總體止是供給材料。但是上層郤有支配下一層的力量，這便是「全體決定分子」。所以張光生說：「外在者左右感官知覺，感官知感又左右槪念。反之，概念解釋感官知覺，感官知覺又混括外在者。」這便是張先生的互相作用主義。</p>
<p>何以我們會有這種知識呢？這乃是由於知識能使我們適應起來便利些。所以知識本身乃是一種生活價値。文化是人類適應環境的過程。所以文化可以說就是知識的客觀化與定型化。</p>
<p>本書的第二部分是說明知識如何受文化的限制。張先生從言語，邏輯，哲學，社會思想四方面來申述這一點。第一，張先生以爲一個民族的語言乃是受這個民族的歷史和文化所決定的。一個民族的心思，可以從這個民族所用的抽象名詞中看出它的特點。例如中國語言多道德名詞，足徵中國思想偏重於人事。第二，邏輯不是表現人類的理性作用，祗是調整語言的缺點而已。不同的文化有不同的語言文法，故不同的文化亦有不同的邏輯。文化上的需要不同，邏輯的樣子便也跟着起變化。第三，哲學乃是最高的理論知識，它的作用也在於適應上的便利。所以它容易受我們自己的態度所支配。因之，哲學家的討論祗是給我們以情緒的滿足，以便調整文化而回過來再改她我們處世做人的態度。第三，社會思想（如道德，政治，經濟，哲學，宗敎等等）都是由於社會需要個人團結起來。社會思想就是用以維繫人心的。所以當社會有不同的需要時便有不同的社會思想。因此，張先生替眞理下了一個定義說：凡足以滿足某一個時代的社會需要的理論知識，便是眞理。</p>
<p>本書的第三部分是想用中國思想的特徵來證明前面的主題。中西文化各有不同的型態，故有不同的思想型態，因爲思想只是一種關於文化的解釋。此地張先生舉出中國哲學的四個特點（一）中國哲學家不講本體和因果原則，而祇講可能的變化與其互相的關係，因爲中國社會有一個倫理的秩序，其間所需要者乃是個人各盡其責，以維繫社會的全體，而哲學便替這種由各個變化中求互相關係的秩序作一合理的辯護。（二）中國哲學中沒有種和類的分別，這也是因爲中國人以爲全體中的各個分子只是相關的符號而不是天然的種類。（三）中國哲學根本上不追求「最後的實在，」因爲中國的思想家只在解次政治問題和社會問題，「本質」的概念，根本就插不進去。（四）中國哲學不講本體，但祇講整體，主張天人合一，萬物一體。</p>
<p>這些思想體系都是適應於當時的社會需要的。中國古代的思想家都是屬於治者和輔助治者的階級而不是被治者的階級，所以他們所想到的問題祇是「內聖外王之道，」而不是一般人的生活技術。張光生說：「中國文化注重道德方面，注重修養方面，乃只是由於所傳下來的書籍都是專爲給士階級讀的。」「意在敎練士人，使其操行特別比一般人來得堅苦卓絕；於是出而濟世，便能致君堯舜」秦統一之後，帝王所需要的輔佐只是一種柔順的人，而儒家思想最能產生這樣的人，所以秦後的思想爲儒家所獨霸。所以先秦時代士的任務是輔助政治；秦統一，士的使命在乎調和民間利益和皇室利益，使君不致流於暴虐無道；宋明的社會患亂愈深，士階級對於本身工作的自信心更需要加强，宋明的理學便是做這種工夫。到了淸代，君主已是異族，士人已無需乎作那種殺身成仁的忠諫，於是趨而講求「實學，」只在一般人民的生活問題上去作打算，不必再作「致君堯舜」的工夫。</p>
<p>最後張先生從中西哲學上所用的範疇的不同來說明中西文化的不同。比較的結束，第一西方範疇比中國來得複雜，所以中國思想便比較的來得簡單；第二，中西範疇在種類上也不相同，中國思想比較注意於實現的方面，而西方思想便是追求現象後面本體，中國思想是倫理的，西方思相玄想的。</p>
<p>總之，人類的思想是社會文化的產物，而社會文化的發展又受思想的限制，這個循環是任何研究所不能避免的。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>從上面這個簡單的介紹中，我們要以看得出張先生的思想體素中已經起了三個很重要的變化。第一，張先生已經放棄了多元論的主張；第二，他運用了文化和社會學來說明知識的構成；第三，他承認知識有帮助人類適應生存的價値。這種改變都是很可喜的，因爲這都符合新思潮的趨勢。現在把這三點再補充說明一下。</p>
<p>以前張先生是主張多元認識論。他曾經把知識分析成功，條理，感覺，概念，設準，格式五個因素。他說「我以爲在根本上是五種互相獨立的。由感覺不能知外物；由格式不能知感覺；由設準不能知格式；由槪念不能知設準……因爲我承認感覺，範疇，設準，概念各有來源而不可歸併。」當時我對張光生這種主張曾作如下的批評：「張先生沒有給我們關於以上五層所以不能不獨立的理由。張先生說牠們各有來源，而他並沒有告訴我們來源是甚麼……我意思，知識的組織雖不能缺少條理，感覺，槪念，設準，格式，然而我進而主張條理，感覺，槪念，設準，格式是一種整個兒的，互相關係的有機體。這五種原料在知識組織中是牽一毛以動全身的。無條理則不能成感覺；無感覺亦不能成槪念；無概念亦不能成設備；無設備亦無由明格式。這種由下而上的相關，我認爲可以用摩耿層創進化論中的「內包」的意思。反過來說，格式支配設準；設準支配概念；概念支配感覺，感覺支配條理。這種百上而下的實效支配，我用「上屬」的關係來解釋。若是知識組織沒有上屬和內包的兩重關係，那只是一盤散沙，而根木無所謂知識，……我們認爲這些原料在知識組織中是互相關聯的完整體。」我這個意見是二十四年五月向張先生提出的。張先生在二十五年十月所發表的多元認識論重述，雖然曾經提到這些層次互相混合，但是還沒有接受我所提議的「內包」和「上屬」的兩重關係。在他寫「知識與文化」一書時（二十九年四月）我們可以說他完全接受我這個提議了。因爲他自己說：「我在此可以說是適川層創進化論的「包底原則」。不過他用於宇宙結構上，我則用於知識的結構上龍了。」這和我在二十五年八月在哲學評論內認識之組織一文中所說：「兩個槪急我借自摩耿的層創進化論。因爲我認爲這兩重關係確能解釋知識的組織」。一語完全吻合。</p>
<p>其次，張先生已走出了康德，不僅從邏輯的秩序中求知識的稱造而從社會的心去說明個人的心，用文化型態來說明思想的型態。這已經走進了黑格闌的圈子。自我是從非我所組成的。當然張先生不願意走出知識論的範圍隨着黑格蘭去講宇宙現象學，然而我們仍不妨適用黑氏的辯證法來說明知識的發展不離社會背景。這一條路張先生正在走着，但尚未明白的承認。</p>
<p>再其次，張先生以爲沒有無所爲的知識，凡知識都是便利於適應的。他說眞理是適合於時代需要的理論知識。這是杜威工具論的主題，見其所著「邏輯」一書。知識中的意義與人類的需要相關聯的。人類生下來沒有先天的格式，而祇有慾望和需要。意義即發生於人類不斷適應環境改變環境以滿足自己需要的行爲。關於這一點張先生似乎尚未充分運用，但大體上已足够使我們滿意了。</p>
<p>其他還有幾處比較細緻而專門的地方似乎尚有商榷之處，但非這樣短的篇幅所能容許，祇好以後有機會再談了。最後有一點値得特別提出的，即張先生表達這樣複雜的思想歷歷如數家珍，娓娓談來，使人百讀不厭，而語語淸晰並無嗨澀，這在講哲學文字中所不易兩全的。書後附錄篇，均陸續見於東方雜誌等刋物，恕不另述。</p>
<h3>出版界的好榜樣　英國報業大王北巖爵士</h3>
<p>— 淸和</p>
<p>几是牘新聞學的，沒有一個人不知道英國的北嚴爵士。（Lord　Northcliff）他是倫敦泰晤士報的主人，他的成功，有五個原因，就是：</p>
<p>（1）他有一個聰明的父親，和一個智慧的母親。</p>
<p>（2）他有極大的膽量，專好自動，又有才幹而能彀忍耐。</p>
<p>（3）他做事始終有具體的計劃，和不易的政策。</p>
<p>（4）他專注意於事業的大體，而不在瑣屑的事件上費工夫。</p>
<p>（5）他是英國第一個人認識報紙的偉大力量的。</p>
<p>他的起點，說來也很有趣，是因爲父親的朋友，送給他一匣玩具，裏面是一些鉛字，引起了他熱烈的興趣，雖然父親是希望他做一個律師的。</p>
<p>在十五歲時，他就到一家報館裏去做訪員，十六歲時，已能寫短簾的文字，送到各大報館裏去登載。</p>
<p>唯有新奇的事物，纔能引起他的注意，如脚踏車，引擎，建築之類。在一八八八年，他創辦一張週刋，叫做「答案」。一八九四年，他用二萬五千鎊買進了晚報，當時那張報紙的營業是失敗的，已經虧本三十萬鎊，自他接辦以後，第一年中就賺了一萬四千鎊。</p>
<p>一八九六年他又發行每日郵報，就是現在銷路最廣的日報。在一九〇八年他做了倫敦泰晤士報的主人，這張報紙，可以左右輿論，林肯曾經說牠和美國的密西西比河，一樣的偉大。</p>
<p>他比任何人都早起二個鐘點，七點鐘已經看完了當天的報紙知明天的評論，等到早餐時候，一天的重要事情已經大半辦去了。</p>
<p>他的最大的主張，是：「一個人須不斷的學習，萬萬不能滿足目前的地位」。</p>

<h3>給青年們推薦　一本進步的人生哲學</h3>
<p>— 楊聰雋</p>
<p>羅家倫著：新人生觀　商務版</p>
<p>我時常感覺到在廣大的青年羣中，往往缺乏一種生活的動力。許多靑年都沒有一貫的生活理想，更說不到中心信仰了。對於生活，毫無正確的認識。自已到這世界來究竟爲了什麼，自己應該給人羣做了什麼，似乎都很少考慮到。許多人說，現在的青年，無論在日常生活上。工作的表現上，都找不着熱忱，大家對生活沒有信念，就隨着動盪的時代，在消沈中萎靡中浮混下去。</p>
<p>在歷史轉捩新舊世界交替的時代，我們常前最迫切的工作，便是拯救靑年，脫離消沈萎靡的深淵，給他們的生活灌輸一些生命的光輝。我們認爲關心敎育文化的人，首先應該担當起「救濟靑年思想的肌荒」的責任。我們要在多歧的人生旅途上，引導靑年走上前進的正確的路，不要再讓他們在十字路口彷徨。</p>
<p>指導青年吸受進步的人生哲學的思想，可以解決青年思想的飢荒，人生的意義，必須了解得正確，生活的目的，必須認識得淸楚。羅曼羅蘭說：「人生就是戰鬥」。是的，生活在大時代中的人們，應該以戰鬥的精神，和現實生活鬥爭，失却戰鬥的力量，生命的光輝也便變得黯淡了。但是怎樣和生活戰鬥，怎樣準備戰鬥的力量，就很先建立一種戰鬥的人生哲學，一種進步的完美的人生觀。</p>
<p>最近商務出版的一部「新人生觀」，確是很適合青年需要的牘物。著者羅家倫先生是教育學術界的前輩，介全團青年生活思想的導師。他的這部書，雖僅一百餘頁，然而却能代表一種正確的人生哲學。羅氏以他獨特的灼知灼見，透視了整個人生的全面。在這個動盪不定的時代中，一般靑年所以缺乏生活的動力，所以消沈萎靡，所以沒有熱忱，所以感到彷徨迷惑，進退不定，所以陷於煩惱和苦悶，就因爲靑年們未曾建立一種正確的人生觀。因此靑年們在今日必須根據自己的知識與經騐，重新估定生命的價値。羅氏的著作，首先就告訴我們新的人生哲學不專恃權威和傳統，必須以理智來審察現實的要求和生命的傳件。新的人生哲學不專講良心良知，而講整個人生及其性格風度的養成，並從經歷和習慣中樹立理想的生活。羅氏又指出生命的價值的重要。舊的價値自然也不該一味抹殺，但必須重新予以估定，使成爲新的價值標準，以實現人生完滿的生活理想。</p>
<p>綜觀全書可以發現一個中心思想：提高人生和改造人生。作者鼓勵我們要追求崇高偉大的人生，莊嚴壯麗的人生。他認爲人生是動的，因爲宇宙是動的，進行不息的，人生是宇宙的一部分，所以也是動的，進行不息的。誠如作者所說，我們如果把靜的人生觀摔的粉碎，重建動的人生觀，那人生該是何等偉大崇高，莊嚴壯麗呵。作者更指出創造的人生覜和大我的人生觀。他要我們不斷的發揮創造的智慧，不但對得起自己的人生，也對得起先哲心血積成的積留。大我的人生觀，是融合「個體」和「人羣」，使人生的力量增大，人生的意義擴充。</p>
<p>羅氏看了靑年萎靡懦弱，缺乏生機和熱忱，提出「力的生活」，要我們不斷向上向前向外努力。同時又闡述了「天行健，君子以自强不息」，要我們永遠做意志的主人，不要做奴隸。創造新的人生又須從創造新的風氣下手。羅氏在這一點上確有其理由。社會的演進，實在不是靠多數沈溺於現在的溷瀦的人去振拔的，而是靠少數特立獨行出類拔萃的人去超度的。平庸的生活的確不値得我們去過，我們應該有建立新的人生哲學的自覺和自信。羅氏寫這些文章的時候，中華民族正遭受空前的厄難，他說了不少激勵靑年發揚民族氣節，確定戰鬥的人生觀的話，很足以培養溥博沈雄的情緒，振舊萎靡衰微的精神！</p>
<p>這本書共分十六章，原是作者於國立中央大學西遷後，對全學生的一套有系統的演講，看上去好像是零篇文章，然而因爲作者有着一貫的人生哲學的修養，在思想上我們尋不出有不調協和不貫氣的地方。我覺得在抗戰期中，這是羅氏思想上的一大收穫。傳統的分門別類的論列人生哲學的專書，我們總感到有些太「敎科書」化，而羅氏的這本「新人生觀」，却矯正了這缺陷，他能根據中外思想家的名言懿行，把中國民旅思想和生命中認爲缺少或貧乏的部分，提出來作討論的中心，發揮了許多新的思想—充滿着力量的思想。作者也承認這部書是他個人用過氣力去思想的一點結束，我相信作者是滿懷着無限的熱情去做這工作的。</p>
<p>作者又能運用他淸麗活潑的筆調，去稱成他思想的精華，所以這本書讀起來很流暢，一無普通人生哲學書籍的枯澀之弊。這裏，我且引他「自序」的幾段：</p>
<p>「浩蕩成紅的鮮血，滂沱如雨的炸片，時代掀起的亘古未有之洪濤，能不使站在存亡絕續關口的我們，對於整個的人生問題，有一度新的審察和領悟？</p>
<p>「我們要生存，我們更要有意義的生存，所以我們那能不追求生存的意義，和達到這有意義生存的方式？</p>
<p>「在這眞實空時構成的創造的宇宙裏，我們的生命是動的，眞實的，更是創造的。我們的思想不能開倒車。我們不能背着時代後退，我們也不能隨着時代前滾，我們要把握住時代的巨輪，有意識的推動牠進向我們光輝的理想。</p>
<p>「我們要發揮憲劍，割去陳腐。我們要廓淸因循，頹廢，軟弱，倚賴，卑怯，和一切時代錯誤的思想生命的毒菌。不但是打掃地方爲了培養新的肌肉，而且是期待長成新的骨幹。</p>
<p>「這偉大的時代，需要我們有力的思想，有力的行爲，有力的生命。」</p>
<p>看了上面的幾段，我們便可以知道作者是以何等的熱忱，去感化在廣漠的社會中徬徨的靑年男女。我再以眞切的態度，把這本進步的人生哲學論文集「新人生觀」，轉薦給充滿着希望的中華兒女。</p>

<h3>Second Plenary Session Opens Yesterday Morning: President Chiang Kai-shek Instructs on Direction of Effort: All Party Members to Complete Mission</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The Kuomintang's Sixth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee's Second Plenary Session was held in the auditorium of the Military Affairs Commission at 9:00 AM on the 1st. A total of 269 people attended, including 194 Central Executive Committee members and 75 Supervisory Committee members. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided over the opening ceremony and delivered the opening address, which was several thousand words long. It briefly stated that the Sixth National Congress and the First Plenary Session had given us five tasks: (1) to strive for victory in the War of Resistance; (2) to promote international cooperation; (3) to implement nationalism thoroughly; (4) to complete democratic constitutionalism; and (5) to improve the people's livelihood. The first three are already accomplished, while the latter two are the active goals of the party and what we should strive to complete after this plenary session. He continued: There are four directions in which party members should strive: (1) Party comrades should give full play to their individuality and do their best to work on cultural, economic, and local self-government matters, promoting national progress in these positions. (2) Party members should see themselves as the vanguard of the people, with serving the people as their greatest duty, to increase the people's faith in the Three Principles of the People. (3) We must awaken party members to cherish the history of the party's revolution and strengthen their confidence in moral principles. (4) We must understand that now is a great opportunity for the fundamental reorganization and renewal of the party, becoming an ordinary political party on the one hand, and maintaining the spirit of the Chinese Revolutionary Party era on the other. After the instruction speech was finished, there was a 15-minute break, and then the preparatory meeting of the general assembly was held to decide on the candidates for the presidium. The meeting adjourned at about 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The focus of discussion at the Second Plenary Session will be on reforming the party. A group of young Central Committee members held a pre-meeting consultation in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters on the 1st, intensely discussing two issues: first, "promoting national spirit and eliminating bureaucracy"; and second, eradicating bureaucratic capital. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to summarize everyone's opinions and make a proposal to be formally submitted to the general assembly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The presidium of the Second Plenary Session held a meeting in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters at 6:00 PM on the 1st, and made decisions on the agenda of the general assembly and the list of chairmen who will take turns presiding over each meeting.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Opening Address</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] President Chiang Kai-shek attended the Sixth Second Plenary Session on the morning of the 1st and delivered the opening address. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Comrades,</p>
<p>Today we are holding the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of our party. This is the first time that all comrades have gathered together after the victory of the War of Resistance, and I feel immense joy.</p>
<p>The task of the plenary session is to review the work of the past, analyze the current situation, and determine the direction of future efforts. This plenary session is being held after the end of the War of Resistance, before the completion of demobilization, and at the very beginning of construction. It is also taking place on the eve of our decision to convene the National Assembly, promulgate the Constitution, and implement constitutional government. Therefore, the task of this meeting is even more important. I believe that all of you will be able to conduct a detailed review of all aspects during the meeting in order to arrive at accurate conclusions. Now, I would like to briefly share my personal feelings and hopes with you.</p>
<p>Three Missions Completed, Two Major Tasks Underway</p>
<p>This plenary session is taking place nine months after the closing of our Sixth National Congress and the First Plenary Session. The National Congress entrusted the current Central Committee with five missions: (1) to strive for victory in the War of Resistance; (2) to promote international cooperation; (3) to implement nationalism thoroughly; (4) to complete democratic constitutionalism; and (5) to improve the people's livelihood. The Central Committee has been working diligently at all times to realize these five missions. Three months after the closing of the First Plenary Session, Japan surrendered unconditionally, and our country's eight years of arduous War of Resistance came to a victorious end. At the same time, the National Government has made great efforts to promote the establishment of international security mechanisms, strengthen the friendly relations and mutual cooperation of the allied countries, and support the self-government of border ethnic groups in order to implement nationalism thoroughly, in accordance with the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and has made concrete decisions. It can be said that the first three missions have been successively accomplished, and the two major tasks that remain are the implementation of democratic constitutionalism and the improvement of the people's livelihood. These two major events are the ultimate goals of the party's revolutionary struggle, and depend on the promotion of political and economic construction. However, economic construction and political construction are closely related political issues. If political problems are not effectively resolved, economic construction cannot be carried out. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, we aimed to advance both resistance and national construction simultaneously. Therefore, after the end of the War of Resistance, considering the overall current situation of the country and the urgent needs of the people, I decided on the policy of peaceful national construction. On the one hand, we overcome all difficulties, cleaned up the battlefield, restored order, and accelerated the work of demobilization, so that the people could have the opportunity to rest and recuperate. At the same time, we put forward two major demands: "Nationalization of the army" and "Democratization of politics," calling on the whole country to work together to promote their success. Regarding the specific proposals for political democratization: to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible, to have social figures and leaders of various parties participate in the government, to guarantee the people's freedom, and to recognize the legal status of political parties. Regarding the nationalization of the army: all the national army should belong to the state, and there should be no more private armies in our country, nor any armies belonging to any one party. The entire national army should be organized by the state, respecting the unity of military and political orders. I explained this decision in detail in my speech on the Victory Day of September 3 last year. I believe that all of you comrades have understood it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Eliminate Difficulties and Obstacles with Public and Sincere Spirit</p>
<p>We, a poor and weak country, have carried out a long-term war of resistance for more than eight years, and there have been crises of turmoil and division and factors of disturbance and disputes during the war. Therefore, we face particularly many difficulties and obstacles in transitioning from wartime to peacetime and in carrying out the work of demobilization and construction. I have always believed that these difficulties and obstacles can only be overcome with the greatest patience and eliminated with a public and sincere spirit. We must also adhere to the policy of "solving political problems through political means" adopted in our previous resolutions. Because the purpose of our national revolution is to save the country and build the country, and the success of national construction after the end of the War of Resistance is related to the survival of the country. The prerequisite for construction is unity and peace. The War of Resistance lasted for more than eight years, with countless casualties and sacrifices. The people were displaced and suffered, longing to return to their homes and work in peace. Therefore, the people's most urgent needs are peace and stability. After the end of the War of Resistance, the various phenomena of disturbance and disputes are unbearable to recall, but our desire to implement constitutional government and return power to the people has not been realized due to various difficulties and obstacles. Our national policy of peaceful construction cannot be carried out smoothly because the whole country has not achieved sincere unity and true unification. This is the difficulty that we believe must be resolved, and it is the unshirkable responsibility of the revolutionary party in building the nation.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis of the situation, you comrades can understand why we have consistently used political methods to resolve disputes, stopped military conflicts through negotiations, and convened the Political Consultative Conference in these nine months. In order to realize the long-cherished wish of convening the National Assembly and implementing constitutional government as soon as possible, and in order to cherish the decline of national strength and people's power after the war, and in order to promote further unity within the country, we, on the one hand, recognized the legal status of various parties, and on the other hand, invited people from various parties and non-partisan social figures to hold a three-week Political Consultative Conference to discuss the nationalization of the army, the democratization of politics, and other aspects. The result of the conference was five agreements: (1) expanding the government organization, (2) the program for peaceful national construction, (3) military issues, (4) issues of the National Assembly, (5) the review of the draft constitution. Among these agreements, the most important spirit is that our Premier Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People has gained unanimous support and compliance. Our government, during the consultative conference, was sincere and willing to seek the opportunity for peaceful national construction by not violating revolutionary doctrine, not shaking the national legal system, and not hesitating to modify the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings on the procedures for national construction. This is a painstaking effort of our party for the country and the people, which all comrades must deeply understand.</p>
<p>Mutual Encouragement During Transition Period, Preparing for the Implementation of Constitutional Government</p>
<p>The various agreements mentioned above and the draft constitution are currently under review, and the issue of the nationalization of the army has been agreed upon by the Military Affairs Trio, and the basic plan for the reorganization of the army and the integration of the Communist army into the national army is awaiting implementation as scheduled. We hope that all parties can be sincere and consistent, for the sake of the country and the people, so that the country can embark on the road of peaceful construction, unity, and democracy. I believe that as long as domestic peace and unity are guaranteed, and the country has a foundation for long-term stability, we should devote all our heart and strength to promote its success. As the ancients said, "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." Our party should first be sincere and trustworthy. I believe that we can move other parties with a sincere heart and create strong mutual trust to facilitate the progress of national construction.</p>
<p>I would also like to declare to all comrades that the simultaneous advancement of the War of Resistance and national construction has always been our established national policy, and the early implementation of constitutional government and the return of power to the people has always been our consistent wish. Our party says, "After the implementation of constitutional government in our country, each political party must compete openly and peacefully in politics before public opinion in order to comply with the spirit of democracy." This transition period is precisely the time for us to learn from each other and encourage each other to create a democratic model. We must prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. We must be on equal footing with all political parties. However, our party still has the special obligation to defend doctrine and protect the Republic of China. The status of our party is slightly different from what it was before the end of the War of Resistance, and we cannot abdicate our responsibility to the country in law and in fact before the implementation of constitutional government. Therefore, this plenary session should conduct a deep review of the direction of the party's future efforts. I believe that the following points should be particularly emphasized:</p>
<p>Shift the Direction of Work, Leading the People in Construction</p>
<p>First, we must shift the direction of the work of our party members and encourage our comrades to give full play to their individual abilities and strengths, and work hard on cultural, economic, and local self-government matters. In these positions, we should promote the progress of national construction, which is also the way to improve ourselves.</p>
<p>Second, every party member must recognize that being a vanguard of the people and serving the people is the greatest duty of a revolutionary party member. Regardless of the position they hold, they must always and everywhere be the first to work hard and lead the people to engage in construction. At the same time, we must do our best to relieve the people's suffering and increase the people's interests. Only in this way can we deepen the people's faith in the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Third, we must awaken our party members to cherish the history of the party's revolution and strengthen their faith in consistently adhering to the Three Principles of the People. The past achievements of the party's fifty years of revolutionary struggle have all been due to the determination to sacrifice oneself and the spirit of continuous innovation. Now, as we face the great era of national construction, we must further promote the great cause of our predecessors and actively move forward to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must understand that now is a great opportunity for the party to fundamentally reorganize and renew itself. On the one hand, we must act as an ordinary political party, and on the other hand, we must maintain the spirit of the Chinese Revolutionary Party era to strengthen the organization of our party. Therefore, the structure must be streamlined, the discipline must be stricter, the steps must be uniform, and the work must be more thorough.</p>
<p>The above points are important principles. As for how to correct past shortcomings, how to achieve the goal of building a healthy party, and how to make the party adapt to the current new environment and fulfill our obligations to the country and the nation, I hope that all comrades will concentrate their attention and discuss them carefully. In short, we must seize this once-in-a-millennium opportunity for national construction, invigorate and encourage ourselves, and strive to be worthy of being followers of Premier Sun Yat-sen, and achieve our sacred mission of preserving the fruits of victory and completing the national revolution.</p>
<h3>Number of National Assembly Delegates Will Continue to Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] It is reported that the relevant parties are currently continuing to discuss increasing the number of National Assembly delegates, including 70 delegates from the northeastern provinces, 17 from Taiwan, 20 from women's groups, 10 from the army, and 3 each from Xinjiang, Xikang, and Chongqing provinces and cities. The total number of delegates will be increased by 150. The methods for recommending and increasing the number of delegates are expected to be announced within a few days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The National Government issued an order on the 1st: (1) Appointing Shao Lizi as a member of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. (2) Appointing Zhang Lisheng as the Director of the National Assembly Delegate Election Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Management of the Military Affairs Commission in Lushun: Our Participating Personnel Will Be Designated Soon: The United States Prepares to Restore Consulates in Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Sources from relevant parties: (1) The preparatory work for the Sino-Soviet Military Affairs Commission for the administration of Lushun has already begun. The Northeast Headquarters will designate personnel to participate in the commission. It is reported that the designated personnel will first go to Chongqing to negotiate with the Soviet side, and then go to Lushun. (2) Most of the old and weak troops of the Soviet army in the Northeast have been transferred back to their country. The soldiers who came to take over are reportedly from Poland and are all very young. The total number of Soviet troops in the Northeast is currently more than before. (3) The Communist troops in the Shenyang and Yingkou areas show signs of retreating and gathering in Dunhua. A spokesperson said: The Communist troops have recently launched offensives in Zhangwu in northern Liaoning and He'an in southern Liaoning.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] The U.S. State Department stated today that the U.S. consulates in Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian will be restored as soon as it is feasible. A State Department spokesperson refused to comment on reports from Chongqing that three American diplomats were in Chongqing awaiting orders, preparing to reopen the above-mentioned three consulates within the next ten days. He was also unwilling to comment on the approximate date.</p>
<h3>Optimism Filled the Cocktail Party: Northeast Conflicts Can Be Resolved: Issues Other Than Army Reorganization Are Already Being Discussed</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Urgent Dispatch, 28th] The ever-changing Northeast problem seems to be optimistic again. Zhang Zhizhong affirmed at a cocktail party hosted by the three committee members of the Executive Headquarters tonight: The Soviet Union will definitely withdraw its troops, and it will be soon. The Northeast military issue has been half resolved due to the establishment of the reorganization and integration plan. The remaining issues have begun to be discussed, and it is believed that an agreement can be reached after returning to Chongqing this time, and it will be announced. Zhou Enlai also said: Regarding the Northeast issues other than army reorganization, the Communist Party and the government have begun to contact each other. The Executive Headquarters may send some personnel to the Northeast to preside over the work of stopping conflicts and restoring transportation. When a reporter asked whether the Northeast army reorganization and mediation work would begin before or after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops, Zhou replied: This question is too specific, I cannot answer it. When a reporter asked for his opinion on the Soviet Union's withdrawal of troops from the Northeast, he replied: The Communist Party has jointly requested the government to announce the truth about the Sino-Soviet negotiations with various parties, but the government has not announced it. Subsequently, a reporter asked for his opinion on the Sino-Soviet economic negotiations. Zhou replied: He did not know the inside story and could not answer.</p>
<p>Zhang, Zhou, and Ma Flew Yesterday to Jining and Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>[United Press, Zhangjiakou, 1st] Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai flew to Zhangjiakou and Jining today, and were pleased to receive assurances from the Communist leaders that they would "immediately and completely obey" any orders from the three-member committee. The three changed to a G47 transport plane for this trip and landed at a small airfield facing wind and snow. They held discussions in the cabin. The Communist side who made the promise of complete cooperation to the three-member committee was Liu Jun, deputy chairman of the Communist Party's Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi Political District, and He Long, a Communist army general in the Suiyuan-Shanxi area. According to He Long, he is prepared to immediately disband his well-trained army of 70,000 troops after receiving orders from the three-member committee. Most of these troops are farmers who can return to their hometowns to cultivate the land. After the three arrived here, the Communist leaders again complained to them that the central army had attacked Communist-occupied towns. Liu Jun also said: The general situation today is still peaceful except for small conflicts. When Japan collapsed, the Communist army in the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi District sent "thousands" of people to the Northeast, and they are still in that area. Because the people in the Northeast are eager to see Chinese troops, the Communist Party sent troops there. However, the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi Political District has no contact with the Soviet army in the Northeast. He could not say whether other Communist army districts have contact with the Soviet army. Marshall and his entourage listened to the reports of the executive groups in Zhangjiakou and Jining, which were "very encouraging." Zhangjiakou is like an armed barracks, and armed people can be seen everywhere. The Communist leaders invited Marshall to a banquet at the headquarters, which was guarded by soldiers with American-made light machine guns. Marshall and his entourage are scheduled to depart tonight and return to Beiping, and continue to inspect Jinan and Xuzhou tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jining, 1st] Special Envoy Marshall arrived at the airport here today. Because the transportation to the city was more than a mile away, and there was only one jeep, he convened an international conference of the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the United States in the plane. All participants sat on the plane's sling chairs and talked for an hour. Marshall then said, "The sling chairs of the G47 plane have various uses, and now they have a new use."</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] The Director of the Headquarters, Li Zongren, hosted a banquet tonight to entertain Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall.</p>
<p>Several Major Issues Awaiting Decision in Chongqing</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Marshall and Zhang Zhizhong will complete their inspection of North China and return to Chongqing before the closing of the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session to discuss several major issues with the central authorities. General Gillen, who came to Beiping with Marshal Marshall, this three-star general who had good cooperation with the Soviet army to cut off the German army's retreat route from the Baltic Sea, will take on the actual important work of the Mediation Executive Headquarters. Reporters judged that his participation in the Executive Headquarters may be a sign that the work of the Executive Headquarters will be expanded to the Northeast. At the cocktail party tonight, Zhou Enlai introduced the senior personnel of the Executive Headquarters to Gillen one by one, and Zhou praised Gillen's glorious achievements in Europe and his scholarly demeanor. At present, the work of the Mediation Executive Headquarters still encounters difficulties from time to time, such as the recent Baoding conflict. Today, Ye Jianying frankly told reporters that a few Communist armies in various places also want to take small advantages and occupy a few more villages, but the Executive Headquarters will effectively stop them. Therefore, there is no doubt that the cessation of conflict will be completely successful. As for the issue of restoring transportation, reporters told him that they had heard that the Communist army had already begun to repair the railway between Tai'an and Yanzhou, and also between Zhangdian and Boshan on the Jiaoji Railway. However, they all sent their own directors and managers. Until today, the Communist armies in various places on the Tianjin-Pukou, Ping-Sui, and Ping-Han Railways had not received formal orders and had not started work. Ye Jianying explained that many transportation teams had not yet been sent out, so the restoration work had not yet actually begun.</p>
<p>Chairman Personally Consoles the Family of Li Liejun</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally went to the residence of the late Committee Member Li Liejun at 4:00 PM on the 28th to pay his respects and console his family.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Talked in Beiping: There Are No More Problems in Yining</h3>
<p>Appendix to the Reconciliation Agreement Will Be Signed Soon</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The problem of the people's demand for local autonomy in Yining, Xinjiang, will be resolved soon. General Zhang Zhizhong told our reporter that he will soon go to sign the tenth article of the annex to the plan for the peaceful resolution of the Yining issue (that is, the second annex to the plan), which he formed with the representatives of Yining. Therefore, the so-called Yining incident will not be a problem. The Northwest Headquarters will administer the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Whether the two provinces of Suiyuan and Shaanxi are included is still under consideration by the government. When he will go to Lanzhou and when the Headquarters will be established have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) in Kunming: Temporarily Suspends Sales of Passenger Tickets</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 28th] The Kunming branch of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has been ordered to temporarily suspend the sale of passenger tickets on all routes from March 1. Most of the planes have been concentrated in Chongqing, both for returning to the capital and for the Ministry of Communications to transport materials.</p>
<h3>New Governor of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, Assumes Office Yesterday, Delivers Important Speech on Foreign Exchange Opening</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The new Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei Zuyi (pictured), accompanied by President Song, arrived at the Central Bank on the Bund at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to assume office. President Song convened a meeting of all senior bank officials, addressed them, and introduced Mr. Bei, stating that the Central Bank was founded by the late Premier, at which time he (Song) was ordered to prepare for its establishment. The initial capital was only 3,200 silver dollars, a very small scale. It was only through gradual and painstaking management and planning that it achieved its present size. Mr. Bei is a senior figure in the financial world and a director of the Central Bank, with particular experience in foreign exchange matters. Therefore, it is deeply believed that he will certainly achieve great things in the future. Subsequently, Dai Mingli, representative of the Ministry of Finance, and Xu Jiguang, representative of the guests, delivered speeches successively, expressing their unlimited expectations for the future development of the Central Bank's business and Mr. Bei's assumption of this important position. Mr. Bei then delivered a speech in reply, stating that President Song had taken great pains for the post-war economic recovery of our country, which he was well aware of. Now, because the foreign exchange problem urgently needs to be resolved, he was ordered to assume office first and will formally take office at a later date. In the future, the handling of foreign exchange affairs will be strictly in accordance with the regulations of the central government, and he hoped that everyone would provide assistance. Finally, Chen Hang, the Vice Governor of the Bank, delivered a speech, emphasizing the difficulties in the establishment of the bank and hoping that all colleagues would continue to work hard to make the Central Bank the bank of banks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that after Mr. Bei assumed office, he announced the appointment of Lin Fengbao as the Director of the Business Department of the Bank and Lin Wei as the Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Bank. Those who went to congratulate Mr. Bei on assuming office yesterday morning included Mayor Qian, Song Hanzhang, Xu Weiming, Liu Gongyun, Zhu RunSheng, Hu Yunqiu, Wang Zhixin, Xu Xueyu, Gu Yiqun, Yang Yinpu, Qin Runqing, Wu Weiru, Liu Hongsheng, Du Yuesheng, He Dekui, Yang Zhixiong, and managers from foreign banks such as Citibank, Chase, and HSBC.</p>
<p>Bei's Remarks</p>
<p>Our reporter specially visited the new Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei Zuyi, yesterday and asked many questions about the Central Bank's current implementation of opening the foreign exchange market and restoring free trading. Mr. Bei answered in detail, which can be summarized into three points as follows: (1) The Central Bank will not set so-called official rates for gold and foreign exchange this time. The prices of foreign exchange and foreign currencies will be determined by observing market conditions and making efforts to balance them when necessary. In the future, the Central Bank will supply, sell, or buy foreign exchange through foreign exchange brokers according to market needs. (2) The names and number of banks designated to operate foreign exchange business will be announced approximately today. As for the approval of Type A businesses (banks, silver shops, and money houses) and Type B businesses (travel agencies) to operate under the scheme, although there are currently no specific qualifications or quota restrictions, only those who have genuinely engaged in such business in the past will be considered. As for the approved foreign exchange brokers, it will also be necessary to see whether they actually have import and export business to do. Those who have relied solely on speculative trading in the past will not be considered. Furthermore, the period of operation for the approved Type A and Type B businesses and foreign exchange brokers is limited. Only those who have performed well during the period will be allowed to continue operating; otherwise, their operating qualifications will be revoked. (3) The government has allocated US$500 million as legal tender reserve this time, which is a part of the Central Bank's existing foreign exchange fund. This is different from the organization and methods of the previous equalization fund. The previous one was relatively fixed, while the current one focuses on balancing international payments and using open market trading to make good use of it, so as to bring the national trade structure into order and facilitate international trade, thereby completing our country's economic recovery plan.</p>
<h3>Military Institutions in North China Will Temporarily Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 1st] Authorities in the war zone stated that military institutions in North China will temporarily maintain the status quo. Before the situation is thoroughly clarified, agencies such as the Headquarters cannot be abolished. Bai Chongxi has come to Beiping to convey the government's intentions for demobilization and troop reorganization, but it is difficult to start immediately. Sun Lianzhong told reporters that he hoped the provincial government would postpone the relocation of insurance agencies because of the extreme shortage of housing there. The Hebei provincial administration will also temporarily maintain the status quo in accordance with the ceasefire order.</p>
<h3>Student Demonstration in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi, 1st] More than ten thousand students from major middle and high schools in Wuxi held a demonstration parade at 9:30 AM on the 1st to respond to the patriotic rights protection movement. They also issued a declaration and shouted slogans along the way, parading throughout the city for three hours with great enthusiasm before dispersing at noon.</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster in Western Yunnan, Central Government Handles Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming, 28th] Recently, the central government, considering that the area of 50,000 square kilometers in western Yunnan had previously been ravaged by enemy forces and suffered severe disasters, decided to set up an office of the Relief Administration in western Yunnan and appointed Xu Songjiu to preside over it. Mr. Xu is scheduled to go to western Yunnan in early March to prepare for the establishment of the office.</p>

<p>One morning, as the sun rose, four US Navy landing ships, each carrying 4,000 tons, loaded with our group of young new soldiers, sailed away from Shanghai. Seagulls soared and glided, expressing their enthusiasm for seeing us off and protecting us, never leaving this large ship sailing towards the sea.</p>
<p>The Qiguang, the Bank of China building, and the Broadway Mansions receded from us, gradually blurring, and soon disappeared. Then, the chimneys of the Yangshupu factories and the Jiangwan airfield approached, receded, and finally the ship left the Wusong estuary, and the waters of the Yangtze River sent us into the vast ocean.</p>
<p>This happened on the morning of February 19th. The young soldiers on board were part of the 207th Division. They had walked, traveled by car, and taken boats from Qujing in the Great Southwest to Shanghai, and now they were sailing from Shanghai to the Northeast, which had been separated from the embrace of the motherland for fourteen years. The reporter joined these enthusiastic troops to see our elders, uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The four American ships helping us transport sailed forward, one closely following the other. I was on the first ship, number 596, the lead ship. Unfortunately, due to mechanical damage, it had to say goodbye to the other three ships and return to the Wusong estuary alone, docking at the Jiujiang wharf to wait for a replacement ship.</p>
<p>The next morning, another landing ship approached, number 714. The iron gate at the bow of the ship opened, and people boarded the deck. Ammunition, guns, bedding, flour, and rice were carried by this group of active young soldiers from the original ship to the other ship. After a day and a half of moving and relocation, the work was completed. On the morning of the 21st, the newly replaced landing ship raised various flags and brought this group of young troops back on the expedition, the only difference being that it had become a lonely boat without companions.</p>
<p>Most of the young soldiers were students and civil servants from the rear areas, lively, strong, and eager to learn. Everyone scrambled to read newspapers and books, and sometimes they even secretly recited while on guard duty. On many occasions, everyone addressed each other as "classmate," which became a popular topic in the military. The shipboard life this time was the same. Most of them had never seen the sea, so they all longed to experience its beauty. However, disappointingly, most of the first day's journey was spent floating on the turbid waters of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>In the evening, the crimson sun sank into the sea, the tide came, and the ship began to shake, swaying left and right more and more violently. The people on the deck eating dinner seemed drunk, unable to stand steadily, staggering and swaying, making it difficult to reach the places they were supposed to go. Then, people in the cabins and on the deck began to vomit, spreading to every corner.</p>
<p>The center of gravity of the landing ship was at the rear. The command tower and heavy objects were all there, so it was light in the front and heavy in the rear. People were in the front, and the draft was shallow, so even without encountering storms, the angle of tilting from side to side was quite large, causing everyone to fall, get up, and vomit continuously. This chaotic scene continued for three hours. Near nine o'clock at night, the ship stopped shaking much, and everyone fell into a daze and went to sleep. The quiet sea at night was only accompanied by the moon showing half its face, sailing along with this lonely boat.</p>
<p>Bright sunshine, clear skies, boundless green, and the sound of waves receding from the side of the ship, churning on the clear water like a milky foam. The sea was calm, and the scenery was exceptionally beautiful and fresh. Everyone seemed to have stepped from a nightmare into another peaceful world, and they felt the greatness and intimacy of the sea. Pleasant expressions were revealed on the faces of every soldier who saw the sea for the first time. This was the second day of the voyage.</p>
<p>After praising and singing for ten hours, everyone began to feel a little lonely. Just then, a black dot appeared on the distant northwest sea. The signal lights on the ship's command tower immediately began to contact the black dot. After half an hour, an American medium-sized warship approached us and began to lead the voyage in front. Soon, another one came from behind, and so one was in front and one was behind, performing escort duties. The formation of the convoy filled everyone with immense joy.</p>
<p>At dusk, the warship behind moved away. Everyone was wary of the threat of storms they had experienced yesterday, some ate less food, and some lay down early. Fortunately, there were only forward and backward movements and no side-to-side swaying, because the ship was heading north, facing the waves coming from the north, so everyone was spared further suffering.</p>
<p>After a night of sleep, the weather had changed to a gloomy appearance, making people feel somewhat depressed. The young soldiers received some platoon training on the ship to avoid wasting time. After the course was over, they mostly leaned on the railings on the deck and gazed into the distance. Where the ship passed, the clear water surged upwards, and in the distance, the waves surged, covering the entire ground. Besides this, there were the cloud shadows in the sky and dozens of seagulls flying low.</p>
<p>The sky became increasingly gloomy and heavy. It drizzled at night, and the waves became larger. It was still an attack head-on, and the forward and backward jolting was quite violent. The ship had entered the Bohai Strait, and everyone was somewhat accustomed to sea life, so they did not feel too uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the morning, there was heavy fog. The ship began to tilt from side to side again. Fortunately, the fog cleared and the sun came out, and the swaying gradually subsided. Around nine o'clock, the escorting warship in front said goodbye to us and turned towards Dagu, because Qinhuangdao was already in sight, and its escort mission was completed.</p>
<p>The seawater had changed from blue-green to light green, and the mountains of Qinhuangdao responded to us, and the harbor was clearly visible. Dozens of warships and transport ships were lined up in the harbor. The railway station, glass factory, iron factory, power plant, and urban houses were all in front of everyone.</p>
<p>The harbor was picturesque, and the wharf extended into the sea. Several large ships were docking with coal trains, loading coal transported from Tangshan to Shanghai and other places. The chimneys of the factories emitted black smoke, and the roars of locomotives rose and fell one after another. Trains and wharf trams shuttled between the harbor, and everyone felt immense excitement and joy. The 714th landing ship carrying the young soldiers north docked at the wharf amid everyone's cheers. The time was 11:00 AM on the 24th.</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao's prosperity largely depends on the wharf and the Kai Luan Coal Mine, which exports coal. Other mines waiting to be developed include iron and arsenic mines. In terms of industry, there is the Yao Hua Glass Factory, whose products sell well in North China and are widely praised. There is also an iron factory, which belongs to the coal mine and is strictly used for repairing machinery.</p>

<h3>US Ready to Use Force to Stop Aggression When Necessary, No Right to Station Troops in Other Countries Without Consent, No Tolerance for Any Country Dominating the World</h3>
<p>Byrnes Delivers Powerful Speech</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a powerful speech to the Overseas Press Club of Washington on the 28th, addressing the world. The full text is approximately 5,000 words, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ready to use force to stop aggression when necessary.</p>
<p>(2) Only an unforgivable mistake between the US and the Soviet Union could cause a serious conflict.</p>
<p>(3) No country has the right to station troops on the territory of other independent countries without approval or consent.</p>
<p>(4) No strong power can unilaterally seize enemy property in liberated countries or countries that have been allied with the enemy.</p>
<p>(5) No tolerance for any country dominating the world.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 1st] The stringent new foreign policy articulated by Byrnes actually foretells that the United States will make a final resolution with Moscow on the deployment of the Red Army in critical areas of Europe and Asia. It has also made it clear that the United States will take strict and direct measures against the Soviet Union's policy of unilaterally seizing property in liberated countries. It is generally believed here that Byrnes' declaration in New York is the prelude to the US government's policy towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Byrnes' Speech</h3>
<p>[US Information Service New York, 28th] Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech to the Overseas Press Club here tonight. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>How to Ensure Peace</p>
<p>We have begun to understand that the war is over, sons, husbands, and fathers have returned home. Opening the newspaper, we are no longer afraid of finding the names of our relatives and family members on the list of the dead. This is such a good thing. But now is not a time for complete celebration and joy. When families in villages and cities often listen to their children recount the battles of Normandy and Iwo Jima after dinner, there is an unspoken question in each of their hearts. This question is: how can we be sure that there will never be war again? In the past, during the war, our goal was very clear: our goal was victory. Indeed: industrial mobilization and military mobilization were the most important issues. Production bottlenecks often seemed impossible to break, transportation difficulties and manpower shortages seemed impossible to overcome. On the front lines, the intricate and complex operations of the combined land, sea, and air forces were frightening to hear about. These were all arduous tasks, but we only needed to ask: "Does this help with victory?" The common goal of victory united us and gave our efforts purpose and direction.</p>
<p>Now we have reached a calm state. Our comfort and gratitude are mixed with unease. Our current goal is lasting peace. We seek lasting peace even more urgently than we previously sought victory. The difficulty is that the road to lasting peace is not as easy to see and find as the road to victory. When we encounter any problem, we first need to ask: "Does this help with peace?" If the answer to this question comes slowly, or even if there is no answer, then we begin to feel uneasy and fearful. Although we have many things that are doubtful and unclear, there are several basic agreements that we are very clear about.</p>
<p>Two Basic Agreements</p>
<p>One is that the result of victory is not necessarily a just and lasting peace? But victory has given us the opportunity to establish such a peace, and our lives are tied to whether we can fully utilize this opportunity.</p>
<p>Another thing we know for sure is that we Americans alone cannot determine whether the world will live in peace or be destroyed in war? Peace does not depend on us alone, but also on others. No country is the complete master of its own destiny. We are all sharing the same fate.</p>
<p>Because we know this, we have pinned our hopes on the banner of the United Nations. We cannot be satisfied just because we have joined this organization. We know that although we have entrusted the dreams of the world to the United Nations, unless each member state has the belief and determination to bring the United Nations to life and make it function on specific cases and all daily affairs, the United Nations will also fail.</p>
<h3>No Right to Station Troops in Another Country Without Permission</h3>
<p>Regarding the initial few meetings of the United Nations, the remarks made by the representatives were candid and straightforward. The sole purpose of these initial meetings was to establish the various institutions of the United Nations. However, among the issues submitted to the Security Council for discussion, several were extremely pressing and needed to be resolved even before the Council had the opportunity to adopt provisional rules and procedures.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the London meetings were not entirely tranquil and peaceful. Some attempted to use the United Nations to advance the selfish goals of their own nations. However, the conflict of national interests and objectives reflected in the London debates is very similar to the conflict of local and special interests reflected in our national and state legislatures. We certainly do not approve of these conflicts of interest, but since these conflicts exist, it is best to openly declare them. If these conflicts of interest are not raised in the discussions of the United Nations, then these discussions will lose their effectiveness and ultimately become futile.</p>
<p>When the governments of Syria and Lebanon filed complaints requesting the withdrawal of British and French troops from their territories, and the Security Council completed its discussion of these complaints, a very important precedent was established. The Council did not take formal action because the permanent members disagreed on the form of the resolution. However, no nation doubted the general proposition that no country has the right to station troops in the territory of another independent country without the latter's permission. No country opposed applying this proposition to the aforementioned outstanding case. The specific solution proposed by U.S. Representative Stettinius in accordance with this principle was supported by the majority of the members of the Council, but was ultimately not accepted because the Soviet Union considered it insufficiently clear and vetoed it. However, the British and French governments immediately declared that, regardless of the Soviet Union's technical veto, they would abide by the U.S. proposal, because that proposal clearly represented the opinion of the Council.</p>
<p>This is enough to show that the mere fact that a permanent member of the Council exercises its legal right of veto does not, in fact, absolve any nation, large or small, of its moral responsibility to act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>The United Nations has had a good start, but this does not mean that its success is guaranteed. It only means that if the peoples of the United Nations sincerely want to make the United Nations Charter effective, it will be effective.</p>
<p>Uphold Charter Commitments</p>
<p>Sometimes our Congress also makes serious mistakes of excess or deficiency. These mistakes are not the fault of the Congress's own system, but the fault of the members of Congress or its constituents, because they have not fulfilled their responsibilities.</p>
<p>The same is true of the United Nations. It will only succeed when we, the peoples of the United Nations, all fulfill our responsibilities.</p>
<p>If I were to tell you that the world situation today is healthy or reassuring, I would not be candid enough. We are still surrounded by suspicion and distrust, which in turn breed more suspicion and distrust.</p>
<p>We have jointly pledged to use force only to defend the law specifically defined in the purposes and principles of the "Charter." We sincerely uphold this commitment, but since we are a major power and a permanent member of the Security Council, we certainly have a responsibility to use our power to ensure that other countries also uphold this commitment. We are also willing to assume this responsibility. Unless all major powers are prepared to act in defense of the law, the United Nations cannot prevent war</p>
<h3>The Practitioner of Science and Patriotism: Zhang Xinfu in Remembrance</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xinfu, the acting Special Commissioner for the Northeast under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was unsuccessful in taking over the Fushun Coal Mine. On his return journey to Shenyang, he was suddenly dragged off the train by bandits, stripped of his clothes, and stabbed to death with bayonets, a total of forty-eight times. His seven accompanying staff members were also killed at the same time. The horrific nature of their deaths brought tears to the eyes of those who saw it and grief to those who heard it. As a former acquaintance, upon receiving news of Mr. Xinfu's death, I sent a letter to Mrs. Li Xiangheng, inquiring about the circumstances of Martyr Zhang's death and the condition of his children. At the end of the letter, I appended a page titled "Fushun," expressing my condolences with the words "The grass and trees contain sorrow, the Northeast will not perish, the martyr lives forever." I previously wrote about the production of the Fushun mining area and Mr. Xinfu's life in a special dispatch to this newspaper from Nanjing. Now, I intend to further elaborate on Mr. Xinfu's character based on what I know, to express my deep sorrow.</p>
<p>Others Hesitated, the Martyr Advanced Bravely</p>
<p>Martyr Zhang was about fifty-two years old and originally from the Northeast. He had studied metallurgy in countries such as England and America for many years. After returning to China, he first engaged in mining in Jilin Province. He also conducted an on-site investigation in the Fushun mining area. Before and after the fall of the Northeast, he twice engaged in mining operations in Hebei and Henan provinces. China's scientific industry is backward, especially because mining equipment is rudimentary and management is difficult, which often makes many excellent engineers hesitate. In addition, the politicians, financiers, and intellectuals of China in the past mostly paid little attention to or even ignored the mining researchers holed up in laboratories, and the engineers and miners who braved the elements and battled all kinds of misfortune in the wilderness, during their difficult struggles when they needed sympathy, encouragement, and assistance. However, when they occasionally saw one or two successful mining tycoons, they would flatter and fawn over them, fearing to be left behind. Examining their motives, most of it seemed to be for the sake of brokering deals and recommending business. According to what Mr. Xinfu told me before his death, he had personally experienced both of these stages.</p>
<p>Living on Two Meals of Bitterness a Day, Not Afraid of Crying in Rags</p>
<p>When the martyr failed in his mining ventures in North China, he was so poor that he lived on two "cornmeal buns" a day. The couple cried together in rags, but they continued to work hard with ever increasing courage. Although the age difference between the husband and wife was limited, four years prior, Mrs. Zhang already looked like a seventy-year-old woman. After the War of Resistance, in order to strengthen the domestic and Allied military industries, the government established a Mercury Industry Administration in Huaihua County, Western Hunan, to develop the cinnabar and mercury mines of Western Hunan, Eastern Sichuan, and Southeastern Guizhou on a large scale. Around 1941, the martyr came to Huaihua County to serve as the "Director of the Mercury Mine Administration." Through his continuous efforts over two years, those glittering things buried in the mountainous areas on the borders of Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces became treasures for us to exchange for foreign currency, one by one. What originally required only a few dozen employees now required thousands. The towering buildings of the Mercury Industry Administration also appeared in that remote county of Huaihua.</p>
<p>Although a High-Ranking Director of the Mercury Mine, Only Rented Three Simple Rooms</p>
<p>As the Director of the Mercury Industry Administration, an equivalent position to a national bank manager, he only rented three simple rooms from nearby residents, living a very plain and natural life. I met him in Huaihua County, and the meeting place was in those three simple rooms. It was in the winter of 1942. It was a cold and terrifying winter. However, in the late winter of this year, a few remnants of bandits in the Hunan-Guizhou border area gathered some rabble and moved from the Huaihua County area to Xiaoqingxi on the Guizhou border (formerly Qingxi County, now a town under Zhenyuan County). There is a saying in Guizhou, "Many rumors when the weather is dry," especially prevalent in places with inconvenient transportation. Once, bandits captured several county towns. At that time, people were panicked and did not know what to do. In order to obtain some real news to use as material for news reports, I made a special trip from Zhijiang to Huaihua County to borrow a car from the Mercury Mine Administration, intending to go deep into the bandit area to see what was happening.</p>
<p>In Order to Ensure the Safety of the Workers, He Ventured Deep into the Bandit's Den</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Mr. Xinfu wanted to go with me. His reason was that the iron mine in Xiaoqingxi was being trialed by the Mercury Industry Administration. He was very worried about the safety of the employees in the iron mine. Finally, after comforting the families of the iron factory workers, he bravely went with me in the same car to the bandit area.</p>
<p>Before I got into the car, Mrs. Zhang repeatedly urged us to come back that day. Mr. Xinfu's four sons and daughters also waved to their father with a hint of fear, shouting in unison, "Dad, come back soon!" Luckily, we got our wish and returned that time. However, this time he left and never returned!</p>
<p>The Martyr's Spirit Inspired, the Bandits Could Not Bear to Shoot</p>
<p>Alas! Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have a wife and children? We are all human beings who have suffered from the war, why be so ruthless? I really can't bear to recall the joyful look on Mrs. Zhang's face when she saw us return from Xiaoqingxi!</p>
<p>The trip to Qingxi didn't seem so dangerous at the time because when we arrived in Yuping County, we heard that the bandits had retreated. Later, according to a bandit who surrendered, they had seen the mine's car in the mountains. Because they knew that mining was beneficial to the people, and they heard that Director Zhang was a good person, they couldn't bear to shoot. This statement is somewhat credible. Originally, Mr. Xinfu was a good person, so even bandits could have a moment of conscience!</p>
<p>Local Tyrants Gnashed Their Teeth with Hatred, Mr. Weng Smiled Through Tears</p>
<p>In 1943, I went to the Northwest. Soon after, Mr. Xinfu was appointed to Ganzhou, to take charge of the tungsten and tin mining area on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces. This was the second stage of Mr. Xinfu's experience as a Chinese industrial and mining expert. Probably because of a mining rights dispute, Mr. Xinfu insisted that the benefits should go to the state, which angered several local tyrants, who filed a harsh complaint with the National Political Council. At that time, Mr. Weng Yongni was so anxious that he jumped up and down, saying, "If people like this can't be trusted, what will become of this world! I am very sad, I am very sad!" But later, after investigations by several supervisory agencies, the truth of Mr. Xinfu's slander was revealed. Mr. Weng smiled through tears and shook Mr. Xinfu's hand affectionately, repeatedly saying, "Xinfu! You are truly hardworking and uncomplaining, not greedy and selfless, a clean and honest civil servant! Don't be discouraged! Keep up the good work! China has right and wrong, the country has a future!" I heard that when Mr. Xinfu was dispatched to the Northeast this time, he entrusted his wife and children to Minister Weng before leaving, which shows that he was indeed a man who feared neither death nor hardship.</p>
<p>On the road to Qingxi, he once said to me, "If we cannot recover that land with an area of 1,303,143,252 cubic kilometers, our poor people will be poor for the rest of their lives. Rather than let it continue like this, I would rather die in the Northeast!" Alas, the words became a prophecy, it is too heartbreaking! I hope he opens his eyes wide and watches that land that will surely be fully recovered sooner or later!</p>
<h3>The Powerful Speech of Mr. Byrnes</h3>
<p>The World Cannot Be Divided</p>
<p>(Continued from the second page) The United States hopes to maintain friendly relations with all countries, but does not want to have exclusive agreements with any country. Naturally, some issues are more relevant to some countries than to others. This is the case for many issues related to the countries of the Americas. The same is true for the control of Germany and Japan. In our relations with other great powers, there are many issues that are more relevant to two or three of us than to others. I see no objection to meetings between the three, four, or five great powers. Even meetings between ourselves alone and the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, or China can help promote coordination between the great powers and peace with the smaller nations. But even in these meetings, as far as the United States is concerned, we will never form cliques to deal with any country. We will not divide the whole world into separate blocs or spheres of influence. In this atomic age, we will never try to dismantle this single and indivisible world.</p>
<p>We openly, happily, and sincerely welcome our Soviet allies to become a great power not under any other country. We have repeatedly accommodated its opinions, agreed to many adjustments, and in the process, eliminated many serious doubts and tried to be favorable to it. Only unforgivable mistakes and tragedies can cause serious conflicts between us in the future. Although our ways of life are different, our people admire and respect our allies and hope to continue to be friends and partners in a world of ever-expanding freedom and ever-improving living standards.</p>
<p>The Charter Must Not Be Violated</p>
<p>For the sake of world peace and our common tradition of friendship with each other, we must clearly declare that the United States will defend the United Nations Charter. All countries, large and small, have agreed, according to the United Nations Charter, not to resort to force or threaten with force, except to defend the law and the purposes and spirit of the Charter.</p>
<p>If anyone uses force or threatens with force to achieve purposes that are contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, we are unwilling and unable to stand idly by. Unless we obtain the free recognition of other sovereign states, we have no right to station troops within their territorial boundaries. We should not unduly prolong the time to achieve peace and continue to station our troops in weak and impoverished countries. No country has the right to arbitrarily seize enemy property in liberated areas or from former enemy dependencies before the Allies reach an agreement on reparations. We have not and cannot agree to any one country deciding for itself what it takes from these countries. We should not launch a war of nerves to achieve strategic goals. We do not want to fall into a situation where no country wants war, but no country can avoid war. We should not consider that drawing attention to the above possible situations that endanger peace constitutes an insult to the country or countries that should be held responsible.</p>
<p>Any country may take certain actions out of its good intentions without fully realizing the consequences of those actions. We should be willing to review our own actions in order to maintain our common interests in peace, because this is far more important to us than the disputes that divide us.</p>
<p>We should restore peacetime conditions. We must remove the terrible legacy left to us by the war. We should let our troops return to their respective homelands. We must dispel the atmosphere of suspicion and fear. We should not deceive ourselves and mislead our allies. To avoid disputes, we should not allow situations to evolve into unmanageable events.</p>
<p>We should abide by the United Nations Charter. This is the only way to achieve peace. We must abide by the Charter. Everyone should have good intentions and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Building a Happy World Together</p>
<p>We, the countries that had patience and inspired each other's confidence in the darkest days of the war, should now also have patience and inspire each other's confidence.</p>
<p>No country can monopolize human wisdom, nor can any country consider itself entitled to act alone. The behavior of friendly nations should be friendly.</p>
<p>Irresponsibly talking about the inevitability of war is tantamount to casting doubt on whether we are loyal to the Charter and infringes upon the freedoms we cherish most at home or abroad.</p>
<p>There are many ideological differences in the world. This has always been the case, but the world is so large that it can accommodate many people with different opinions and many governments with different systems.</p>
<p>No one can predict the distant future and the final situation, but we are closely linked together as part of a common culture.</p>
<p>Looking at the results of war destruction, we should understand that the difficult task of postwar reconstruction and creating higher living standards for the people requires our full efforts.</p>
<p>All countries, large and small, should work together to build a more friendly and happier world. If we cannot work together, then none of us can achieve peace and tranquility, and there is not much hope for the future. (End)</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Convening of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee</h3>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang officially opened yesterday in the provisional capital, Chongqing. The convocation of this meeting is the first of its kind since the Kuomintang led the entire nation to victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and takes place after the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, on the eve of the end of political tutelage and the implementation of constitutional government, its significance is extremely great. Looking to the past and opening up the future, the achievements of this conference will undoubtedly be epoch-making in the history of the Kuomintang. The Chinese national liberation movement is deeply intertwined with the Kuomintang, and the rise and fall of the Kuomintang is of profound significance to the national future of China. As it holds this historic meeting, we would like to express our sincere congratulations.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang is currently standing at a historical turning point. The future direction and actions of the Kuomintang will not only affect the prosperity and decline of the Kuomintang itself, but also the rise and fall of the nation. Today, the War of Resistance has been won, but the current crisis may be even greater than in the past. Considering the domestic and international situation, problems abound and hidden reefs are everywhere; the spring breeze appears but dark clouds gather again, victory is in hand but difficulties have not been alleviated. How to open up the current situation and lead the country onto the path of revitalization and construction is not only the responsibility of the entire nation, but also the heavy responsibility of the Kuomintang, which is currently the largest party. Today, the Central Committee members of the Kuomintang are gathered in the provisional capital and we hope to offer some opinions based on our observations.</p>
<p>First, regarding the problems of the Kuomintang itself, on the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, there are many issues that need to be discussed and decided. Among them, there are two points whose importance cannot be ignored: (1) How to rectify party discipline; (2) How to utilize new momentum. Today, many Chinese people have negative views of the Kuomintang. The reason is often due to the misconduct of Kuomintang officials in various places, who take advantage of their positions to bully others, leading to a loss of popular support. If the Kuomintang wants to win over the people in the future, it must vigorously change the declining trends of recent years, and how to rectify the discipline of party members is particularly urgent. A political party is originally composed of countless members; it is inevitable that there will be both good and bad elements when there are too many members. There are many loyal people in the Kuomintang, but the existence of a few bad elements is enough to destroy the reputation of the Kuomintang. The launch of the Kuomintang's "Rectification Movement" is truly urgent. On the positive side, the Kuomintang has been able to exert its greatest strength in every historical stage of the past fifty years. The overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and the National Revolution of 1926 were both epoch-making national liberation movements, and the Kuomintang was able to seize the opportunity and accomplish its mission. Now is also the beginning of a historical stage, and the current objective situation is completely different from the past. How to utilize new momentum to exert the power of the Kuomintang, as mentioned above, not only affects the prosperity and decline of the Kuomintang itself, but also concerns the rise and fall of the nation. The overthrow of the Qing Dynasty was mainly due to the patriots in various places and the scholars full of nationalistic ideas; the climax of the National Revolution occurred after the May Fourth New Culture Movement. The use of momentum in these two stages was already different. Now, on the eve of national construction, the Kuomintang must utilize a new momentum in order to continue to carry forward its past glory.</p>
<p>Second, regarding political issues, how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. The Three Principles of the People are the highest guiding principles for our national construction and have been accepted by all parties and factions, so how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution should not be a problem. However, the agreements reached at this Political Consultative Conference greatly violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, such as those concerning the Five-Yuan system and the status of provinces. The Five-Power Constitution is a great legacy left to the Chinese people by Sun Yat-sen, with careful and rigorous articles, its purpose is to save the shortcomings of Western parliamentary politics and establish a sound political system for the Three Principles of the People, and should not be misunderstood or misinterpreted. The agreements made by this Political Consultative Conference on the draft constitution will divide and dismember the political system that the Three Principles of the People want to establish; if they are implemented, the efforts of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years will be wasted. The crisis is far greater than Yuan Shikai's conspiracy in the early years of the Republic. As for raising the status of provinces and giving provinces their own constitutions, it is a disguised form of local separatism, which is opposed by the Chinese people. The fact that each state in the United States has its own constitution has a historical background; the federal government of the United States was formed by the collection of various states. The situation in our country is different, it was originally a centrally unified political system, and we must not allow centrifugal division, resulting in a repeat of the local separatist situation. After a long war, the Chinese people urgently want a stable order, so that they have the opportunity to recuperate and recuperate; therefore, they are very concerned about the issue of the political system.</p>
<p>At this time, the Central Committee members of the Kuomintang are gathered in the provisional capital, and it is hoped that in accepting the results of the Political Consultative Conference, the spirit of the Three Principles of the People can be preserved. The future of the nation depends on it.</p>
<h3>Reader Opinion: Why Not "Borrow a Head" to Stabilize Prices?</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>After gold rose sharply, the prices of all goods followed suit, and the staple food of the people, rice, even surpassed them, rising by one times in three days, and there is a trend of breaking through the 30,000 mark and continuing to rise. Gold is not a daily necessity, and its price increase seems to be unrelated to people's livelihoods. However, rice is a necessity for the people's food. At a time when labor unrest is frequent and society is extremely unstable, if we allow the price to continue to soar, the affairs of the country and the people will be unimaginable!</p>
<p>The government must be planning in detail to stabilize the financial situation and suppress prices; but the result of rushing and delaying may also lead to the death of the patient, and the authorities do not seem to have appropriate measures to suppress the price of rice and then suppress the price of goods, which inevitably makes people feel like a "slow doctor" is "sending the patient to death"!</p>
<p>We seem to be clear that the crux of this rice price surge is mainly caused by human factors, so we really hope that the authorities can quickly adopt decisive means and emulate the established rules of the Guilin mayor "borrowing a head to suppress rice prices" to imitate, so that today's situation of "one road cries and one family laughs" becomes "one family cries and one road laughs", which is a virtuous policy at present, and also the only emergency rescue measure for prices today.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1943, the price of rice in Guilin City, Guangxi Province, rose sharply by 50%, and the authorities tried many ways but could not suppress it. Finally, Mayor Su Xinmin's written speech was effective. The general idea of the speech was that officials can not be officials, but rice prices cannot be uneven, and the mayor will fight the profiteers, and adopt borrowing a head to stabilize prices! Although the head was not borrowed, the profiteers finally knew that it was difficult to stop, and the rice price did indeed fall!</p>
<p>The matter is urgent! I hope the authorities will try it to relieve the people's suffering, which is a great merit!</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Disputes at a Cotton Mill Lead to an Accident: Three Police Chiefs Assaulted; Representatives from Party and Government Agencies Sent to Investigate</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] At about 2 p.m. yesterday, the Xin Yu Cotton Mill at No. 8 Changshou Road in West Shanghai had a dispute between labor and management over the issue of partial wages during the work stoppage period, leading to a disturbance. Afterward, the Putuo Road Branch dispatched three plainclothes police chiefs to investigate the situation. The factory manager, Zeng Xiangxi, was asked a question. The workers thought the police had let him go, and the crowd was outraged. As a result, the police chiefs Wang Zhigang, Zhou Xueqin, and Cai Weiqing were beaten by the crowd. It is reported that Wang was hit on the chest and back with weapons such as iron bars, and suffered severe injuries. Zhou and Cai suffered minor injuries. Upon receiving the report, Branch Chief Qi Jingzhi immediately dispatched seven armed police officers to suppress the situation and telegraphed the General Bureau for instructions. The General Bureau sent a red police car to the scene. At that time, the workers had closed the gates and strictly prohibited entry and exit. At the same time, the city's Party Department, Social Bureau, and General Labor Union had also heard the news and sent representatives to investigate the cause of the incident. Until 12 a.m., the surrounded police cars and armed police officers were withdrawn. The injured police chiefs were sent to the police hospital for treatment. All disputes will be resolved reasonably by various agencies this morning.</p>
<h3>Employees of the District Court Procuratorate Demand Improved Treatment, Hold Meeting Yesterday to Present Four Demands</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate handles approximately 200 cases per month, making the workload quite heavy. With the continuous soaring of prices, the salaries of judges and prosecutors are only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Therefore, more than 200 employees of the District Court Procuratorate held a meeting yesterday morning at the office to appeal to various parties.</p>
<p>Implement the Four Banks Method Pending Approval</p>
<p>A Court Colleagues Welfare Committee was established and resolved to pass four demands: (1) Court treatment should be the same as that of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau. Before central approval, the Four Banks method should still be followed, with prosecutors receiving advances of 250,000 yuan, clerks 200,000 yuan, recorders 160,000 yuan, bailiffs 140,000 yuan, and laborers 120,000 yuan. (2) Property donations and fines for petty offenses in this city were originally court revenue but were transferred to the municipal government after the victory. These funds are urgently needed to serve as the Court Colleagues Welfare Fund. (3) Request the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to allocate housing to serve as court colleagues' dormitories. (4) Request the Relief Administration to allocate clothing. Finally, a firm commitment was made to continue working as usual until all demands are satisfactorily resolved. If it becomes absolutely necessary in the end, all employees will submit a collective resignation to seek other livelihoods.</p>
<p>Six Public Utility Workers Raise Demands</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Workers from the gas, telephone, Anglo-French electricity, and six major public utilities have recently collectively submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting improved treatment and a temporary loan of 150,000 yuan, among other demands. Director Wu Kaixian personally met with representatives of the six companies' workers at 2:00 PM yesterday. He considered the temporary loan of 150,000 yuan inappropriate and suggested a pre-payment of half a month's salary and early salary disbursement. As for special subsidies, Director Wu promised 7,000 yuan per month and decided to hold formal negotiations at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, workers at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant began a work slowdown yesterday due to excessively low wages that made it impossible to maintain their current living standards. Labor and management were mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau in the afternoon, and their views have gradually converged. Work will resume first today.</p>
<p>Negotiations Continue in the Western Cuisine Industry Labor Dispute</p>
<p>Employees of Western cuisine and coffee shops held a reception for reporters at the Jingu Hotel yesterday, where Chairman Zhu Shifa reported on the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation process, the issue of workers returning to work, and petty gratuities, etc. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM today to convene both parties for continued mediation.</p>
<h3>Two Robberies with Guns Wound One Victim</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At the home of Zeng Xiangxu at No. 39, Lane 170, Qiqi Road, around 10:00 PM last night, three robbers armed with firearms broke in and looted a large quantity of gold bars and cash.

<h3>Three Criminals Accused of Forging Bank Drafts Interrogated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Last July, Li Tingwu, Shao Yanling, and Zhu Honghai planned to forge 2,000 yuan bank drafts issued by the Hangzhou branch of the Central Bank. On November 14, Shao contacted Mei Zhun Caiyin Factory at No. 11, Lane 86, Maoming Road in this city. The factory owner, Chen Xinxiu, initially refused to print them, but the accountant, Xu Chengxiang, intervened, and the printing was accepted for a fee of 220,000 yuan. Zhu Honghai then contacted Wang Baifu Printing Shop at No. 4, Lane 49, Rehe Road to reprint the signatures and seals on the drafts. The case was later cracked by the police and sent to the court. The District Court interrogated them yesterday and ordered them to be remanded in custody to await trial.</p>

However, passengers traveling to Guangdong and Beiping must still obtain approval from the Executive Yuan's Shanghai office before purchasing tickets.</p>
<h3>Relief Administration Sells Flour at Reduced Prices, Unit Changed to One Bag</h3>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief Administration adopted a policy of unlimited flour sales, the initial stipulation was that each unit was 20 bags, then later changed to five bags, with each bag priced at 6,000 yuan, so five bags cost 30,000 yuan. Now, in order to consider the burden on general households and civilians, the Provincial Department of Finance has changed the unit from five bags to one bag from the 3rd of this month, temporarily still using warehouse receipts. In addition to entrusting the original Postal Remittance Bureau, Shanghai Commercial, Zhejiang Xingye, China Industrial, Continental, Guohua, Zhongnan, Jincheng, China Reclamation, China Agricultural and Industrial, and China Discontinued, twelve banks, three additional banks have been entrusted to collect payments: China National Products, China Enterprise, and Shanghai Silk Industry. The administration is also planning to select central locations in various districts within the city to directly sell flour, in order to facilitate purchases by citizens.</p>
<h3>A Puppet Official Dies in Prison</h3>

After the success of the Northern Expedition, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Zhang served as a legislator. After the August 13th Incident, Zhang retreated to Hong Kong. When the Pacific War broke out and Hong Kong fell, Zhang went into hiding in Shanghai. In April of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he submitted to the enemy and served as Deputy President of the Puppet Judicial Yuan. He was arrested after the surrender of the Japanese.</p>

It was jointly established by nine shipping companies in this city: Great Britain, Changxing, Tianxiang, Mahler, Baohe, Blue Funnel, Prince (Jardine Matheson Overseas Department), Jardine Matheson, and Taikoo. It was agreed at the time to last six months. Today, that term has expired, and on the 3rd, each will resume independent operations. The Great Britain Company office began operations yesterday.

<h3>Yisheng Steamer Fails to Sail After Uncovering Passengers Without Tickets</h3>
<p>The Yisheng steamer of Jardine Matheson and the Fuzhou steamer of Taikoo were originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong from Shanghai on Wednesday, but were delayed by rain affecting cargo loading. They were rescheduled to set sail yesterday afternoon. The Fuzhou steamer departed on time. Before the Yisheng steamer set sail, a large number of passengers without tickets and with black market tickets were discovered. The company immediately sent British sailors aboard to expel them. However, the passengers believed that all fees had been paid and refused to disembark for no reason. As a result, the expulsion was ineffective, and the shipowner refused to sail. The company then moved the ship from the Taikoo Wharf in Puxi to the Yitai Hing Wharf in Pudong and sent personnel with ticket stubs on board for re-inspection, planning to expel passengers without tickets and with black market tickets again. No resolution had been reached by evening, and it is uncertain whether it will depart today.</p>

<h3>Large Number of Ships to Be Transported from America; Fishing Fleet Assembled, It Will Not Be Difficult for China to Become a Leader in Far East Fisheries</h3>
<p>Relief Administration Purchasing Director Receives Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A large number of ships will soon be transported to our country by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Mr. Swanson, the Purchasing Director of the Administration, who arrived in Shanghai a week ago, told reporters yesterday that the items the "UNRRA" will purchase are mainly various large and small ships and navigation equipment, worth about 40 million US dollars. The second largest item is fishing boats and various fishing supplies, worth about 35 million US dollars, some of which were donated by Brazil to "UNRRA". The next largest item is medical supplies, worth about 15 million US dollars. In addition, there are construction materials, various hand tools, and transportation and repair equipment, which will greatly assist China's recovery. The total value of materials submitted to China from the US military surplus is over 100 million US dollars, and the total amount of assistance from UNRRA to our country is 67.5 million US dollars.</p>
<p>The total number of ships transported to China includes 40 transport ships, landing craft, etc. over 1,000 tons, 140 ships under 1,000 tons, 175 tugboats, over 600 shallow-water vessels, and oil tankers. Four ships have recently been test-sailed to Hankou and Changsha. UNRRA is now in urgent need of a large number of seamen, especially engineers familiar with the use of diesel engines. Mr. Harding, UNRRA Shanghai Shipping Director, said that "UNRRA" also needs a large number of pilots familiar with the upstream and downstream navigation of the Yangtze River. They hope that this talent in our country can register with "UNRRA" or "Xingzong" [Executive Headquarters], which can provide them with an excellent career.</p>
<p>"UNRRA" plans to build a fishing fleet of 232 ships for our country. It has already purchased 55 fishing boats in Australia, which are expected to arrive in China in March and April. After they are all in operation in the future, China will obtain a huge 100 million pounds of fish annually. In answering reporters' questions, Mr. Smith said that he has already purchased 110 ships of various sizes, including 10 landing craft. In addition, these ships will be managed by "Xingzong" after they arrive in China.</p>
<h3>Social Services: Market Price Hikes Subsided, Store Price Tags Still Not Reduced</h3>
<p>Civilian Livelihood Problem Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I am raising an urgent issue concerning civilian livelihoods. Please publish it in the "Social Services" column. Since the victory, in less than half a year, civilian livelihoods have become increasingly difficult, and social order has been disrupted and unstable. Although the reasons are complex, the authorities' ineffective control of finance and materials, allowing the floods to run rampant, cannot be dismissed. Secondly, the selfishness and self-interest of merchants, disregarding the lives of the masses and arbitrarily raising prices, is also a major reason. For example, a few days ago, the price of gold, rice, and various major commodities soared, and the market was chaotic and restless. Fortunately, after Chairman Chiang returned to Chongqing and decided to announce measures to control foreign exchange, various major commodities fell by 30-40%. However, the essential daily necessities on the market have still not been reduced. Just pay attention to the price tags in the shop windows of various merchants, and it will become clear. For example, before the price of gold was 130,000 per tael and the price of white rice was over 10,000 per picul, a pair of small cowhide rubber-soled leather shoes was priced at over 7,000. Later, due to the soaring price of gold and white rice, the store raised the price tag to around 20,000 yuan (an increase of more than one time). Now that the price of gold and white rice has fallen back to the original amount, the leather shoes are still sold for 20,000 yuan and have not returned to 7,000 yuan. These cold-blooded, selfish, self-interested merchants, overreacting to the price hikes, immediately raise the price tags, one rise after another, without ever lowering prices. Their exploitation is even more blood-sucking than that of commodity speculators. Therefore, I request that the media come together to correct this and urge the police bureau and the social bureau to quickly form an economic police force to monitor and secretly investigate and set fair prices, ordering all merchants to abide by the law. The purpose is to prevent profiteering by unscrupulous merchants and relieve the suffering of the people. This represents the opinion of the people, and I think you, sir, will not reject it! Sincerely, Tang Zhijun.</p>

<h3>Idle Capital Absorbs on Dips, Gold Price Rebounds in Afternoon, US Dollar Supply High, Price Drops</h3>
<p>With anxious hearts, the general sentiment is that the Bank of China's implementation of foreign exchange trading next Monday will inevitably constrain the gold market in the short term. Speculators eager for quick profits will have no opportunities afterward, so they are turning elsewhere. Those holding gold are also selling to lock in profits. Securities firms deeply hope for the upcoming meeting of the board of directors of the industry association. In the afternoon, they sold gold to cover their stock delivery positions. However, idle capital from miscellaneous firms believed the price had already fallen significantly, and there was no shortage of activity to buy on the dips. Therefore, from the opening price of 1.45 million, it gradually declined slightly, once breaking below 1.3 million in the afternoon. However, it quickly recovered to around 1.4 million. Jewelry stores have resumed quoting prices, but the selling prices are too far from the market price, about 10,000 yuan higher per tael. Generally, idle capital is competing to buy from the black market, so the result is still a rise of 20,000 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Ornament gold prices fell from 150,000 yuan to 145,000 yuan, but finally returned to 150,000 yuan. Standard silver fell to 1,800 yuan. The decline in silver dollar prices has stopped, hovering around 800 yuan. Black market interest rates range from 1.8 to 2.4 jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign currency US dollar also first stabilized then weakened. With the Bank of China's public trading date approaching, the foreign currency spot market is suffering a fatal blow from the customs announcement restricting entry and exit. Those holding dollars, noting the thoroughness of the announced foreign exchange trading measures, foresee that the spot market will gradually be eliminated in the near future. A large amount of physical currency is being sold off, and with speculation disappearing, supply exceeds demand, disrupting the balance. Therefore, after opening around 2,000 yuan, it briefly rose to 2,050 yuan but was immediately met with selling pressure. The 2,000 yuan mark was also difficult to maintain, hovering around 1,970 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, following the decline in gold prices, it broke below the 1,900 yuan mark. Finally, it was pulled up again by gold, resulting in a further decline of 30 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Foreign exchange tickets also could not avoid the trend. Holders are still selling off large quantities, causing old tickets to fall by 30 yuan, while new tickets still have buyers taking advantage of the cheap prices, falling only 3 yuan. The gap between the US dollar and gold has widened again to 710 yuan per ten taels, and the concept of light currency is resurfacing.</p>
<h3>Securities Industry Discusses Resuming Business, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both Active</h3>
<p>Benefiting from the light of public and foreign stocks, retail investors absorbed at low prices. Class B shares rose from an opening of 1,750 yuan to 1,900 yuan, closing at 1,850 yuan with selling pressure. The process was mediocre, about half a percent better than the previous closing price, with popular stocks around one percent better. Chinese stocks still seem to be rising, and after the rise, they also entered a consolidation phase. However, asking prices vary widely, and other than using automatic telephones, there is no other way to communicate within the industry. Therefore, everyone acts independently, making it extremely difficult to make timely estimates. The result is an improvement of between half a percent and one percent. Foreign stocks were sharp and active as soon as they entered the market. The Securities Industry Council convened in the afternoon to discuss ways to resume business, and foreign businessmen also came to show support. The result is an improvement of between one percent and one and a half percent.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth All Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market declined sharply. For several days, after the news of the foreign exchange opening was released, people's hearts entered a state of despondency. In addition, yesterday's sudden tightening of credit and sluggish sales due to continuous rain made the situation worse. All types of 20-count yarn have fallen within the 1 million mark. Small yarn has plummeted to around 800,000, almost on par with 16-count yarn. Looking at all counts of yarn, a general decline of about 10% is seen.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton trading was still flat, and the market situation was unremarkable. The Textile Construction Company is taking a wait-and-see approach. Privately-owned yarn factories, such as Shenxin No. 1 and No. 6 factories, are slightly purchasing. Zhoupu seed cotton has not yet been launched.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market is full of selling voices, and the market is showing weakness. At the same time, the China Textile Construction Company's supply of cotton cloth these days is very generous, and factories that have been allocated numbers are willing to transfer them out with thin profits.</p>
<p>Also reported, the China Textile Construction Company sold 54,500 bolts of colored ball fine cloth, 25,500 bolts of "carp leaping" color electric light twill, 52,000 bolts of 80-count maiden bleached poplin, and 55,000 bolts of green mosquito netting.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Arrive Sparsely, Prices Are Firm</h3>
<p>Due to continuous rain, rice and grain arrivals are scarce, and sentiment is turning positive, so prices have risen another thousand yuan. However, store sales are weak, and very few transactions took place at noon, resulting in a sluggish situation. Flour from Qingdao and Tianjin is not selling well. Spot goods are still being actively digested, and prices have risen slightly by one or two hundred yuan. Yellow soybeans have also increased by three or four hundred yuan. The oil market remains soft, tending towards flat and weak. Raw peanuts are holding steady, and sesame is similar. Soybean cake has increased by one or two hundred yuan, with arrivals and sales in balance. Bran is sluggish and weak, with prices down slightly by one or two hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>300 Rolls of Newspaper Arrive</h3>
<p>Cotton, cotton cloth, and transportation equipment all arrived on the American President Lines' ship "World Liner Sea Arrow," which arrived in Shanghai for the first time at approximately 3:00 PM yesterday. It carried a large amount of supplies from New York, including over 1,000 tons of railway tracks and railway materials for the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, over 7,000 bales of cotton, 3,000 boxes of cotton cloth for the Production Bureau, over 20,000 pieces of relief old clothes and shoes, 300 rolls of newsprint, 600 tons of alkali (industrial raw material), and over 1,000 boxes of "Whiskey," totaling 8,900 tons.</p>
<h3>The Downtrend in Silk and Satin Has Stopped</h3>
<p>The current price of 120-count Tianqiao rayon opened at 1.7 million yuan, with quite a few transactions around 1.72-1.73 million, later rising to close at 1.8 million yuan. In the afternoon, prices outside the market were quoted at 1.85 to 1.9 million yuan, but no transactions occurred. Five-load factory silk has contract goods at 2.35 million yuan per load. Another load of gan jing silk is more than 100,000 yuan lower than the previous day. After the price of satin dropped, people began to inquire. The city's stalls saw an increase in activity yesterday. Meiya quilt covers rose by 60,000 yuan per hundred compared to the previous day, and Dacheng military style cloth rose by a little less than 100 yuan per yard.</p>

<h3>Thrilling Basketball League Match, Last Three Minutes, Hua Lian Defeats Giant, Kong Guangyi Succeeds in Consecutive Shots, Wins 30 to 28 by Two Points</h3>
<p>Amidst the continuous spring rain, last night's municipal gymnasium unfolded its first grand occasion, with approximately 1,500 fans in attendance. In the Group A1 basketball league, Hua Lian relied on Kong Guangyi's long-range shots in the last three minutes to finally defeat their formidable enemy Giant by a score of 30 to 28, a difference of two points, passing another obstacle in their championship journey. In the first half, Hua Lian led 15 to 11. Neither side reached their ideal level of performance. Hua Lian's tight defense was the key to victory. Giant was unable to break through, Carson was at a loss, and they missed many easy shots. Li Zhenzhong was still the central figure for Hua Lian. In the other two matches, in Group A2, Red Team defeated Xingzhong 64 to 47, with a halftime score of 32 to 28. In the women's group, Green Team crushed Snow White 40 to 17, with a halftime score of 19 to 7.</p>
<p>In the final major battle, Hua Lian and Giant faced off. The former used their five tigers, Zhenzhong, Guangyi, Chengzhang, Xuechong, and Liangxiong. Giant used Carson, Katchimirov, Manique, Taublincki, and Stevenson. After the jump ball, a back-and-forth situation immediately appeared. Giant scored first, but Zhang Liangxiong immediately made a long-range shot. Chen Xuechong had a 4-on-1 advantage. Giant pursued, and the score remained at a one-point difference. The situation was extremely tense. Only when it reached an 11-11 tie did Wu Chengzhang make a shot, and Kong Guangyi followed up with another, giving Hua Lian a 15-11 lead at halftime. After switching positions, the situation progressed in equilibrium. Then, in the midst of Fanick fouling, Chen Xuechong scored three consecutive points. Hua Lian's Chen Xuechong's luck turned around, scoring three consecutive points. Zhenzhong did not want to be outdone. Hua Lian seemed to be comfortably leading 25-16. Giant brought in Van, which was very effective. In the last four minutes, Giant actually caught up to a 28-28 tie. The cheers from both sides were incessant. Kong Guangyi did not disappoint the crowd and made a long-range shot, giving Hua Lian a hard-fought two-point victory with a score of 30 to 28.</p>

<h3>Review of "Knowledge and Culture" by Zhang Dongsun</h3>
<p>— Fu Tongxian</p>
<p>Publisher: The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Date: First Edition, January 1946</p>
<p>Price: 1000 Yuan</p>
<p>Pages: 277</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's "Knowledge and Culture" is a valuable book in our country's academic circles, and from his own tone, one can see that it is also the author's proud work. Therefore, we dare to solemnly recommend it to readers. This book was completed in April 1940. At that time, Mr. Zhang wrote to me saying that the book would be published soon. I originally wanted to read it as soon as possible, but it was not until six years later that I finally saw it, so it can be said that I regret not seeing it sooner.</p>
<p>This book elaborates Mr. Zhang's arguments on epistemology. Regarding this aspect, I have had several discussions with Mr. Zhang, and it was not easy for our views to align. For example, in his "Theory of Knowledge" (World Publishing) published in 1934, Mr. Zhang advocated epistemological pluralism, and I had many disagreements, and I wrote an article titled "Is Knowledge Pluralistic or Monistic?" to criticize him (see "Zhang Dongsun's Pluralistic Theory of Knowledge" edited by Zhan Wenhufu). Later, I also read his "Restatement of Pluralistic Theory of Knowledge" (published in January 1937 in the Festschrift for Mr. Zhang Jusheng's Seventieth Birthday), although there were some revisions, I still felt unsatisfied. This time, Mr. Zhang's epistemology appeared with a new face. It has undergone significant changes and is very close to my own opinions. Therefore, this time when I read Mr. Zhang's article, I felt particularly close to the meaning, and many of the words were exactly what I wanted to say. Therefore, I would like to give a brief introduction to Mr. Zhang's recent arguments in this article, and then elaborate on a few opinions that I have formed after seeing the changes in Mr. Zhang's thought.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to establish an independent epistemology, especially to explain the relationship between knowledge and culture. Mr. Zhang's argument is called the "Theory of Pluralistic Interaction," in which Mr. Zhang wants to explain two kinds of interaction. The first kind of interaction is about the structure of knowledge itself, that is, it shows that sensation, perception, concept, and external framework interact with each other. The second kind of interaction is about the mutual influence between knowledge and culture. Knowledge is limited by culture, and culture is also influenced by thought. The whole book is divided into three parts: (1) from knowledge to culture, analyzing the nature of knowledge to show that knowledge is culture; (2) from culture to knowledge, explaining how the formation of theoretical knowledge is limited by culture; (3) discussing the characteristics of Chinese thought, using examples to prove the relationship between knowledge and national culture.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The first part is to explain the nature of knowledge. Human knowledge is an extremely complex organization. It can be analyzed into four organizational factors: (1) external related objects; (2) sensation; (3) perception; (4) concept. They "rely on each other, permeate each other, limit each other, influence each other, and affect each other." First, the external object must be recognized in the knowledge organization, because if there is no external object, then there is no way to explain why our senses have various changes. As for what this "external object" is, it is best not to say a word in the scope of epistemology, because the more we talk, the further away we are from this "external object," and the less likely we are to understand it. Therefore, Mr. Zhang said: "We have no choice but to admit it and not seek further explanation."</p>
<p>Second, sensation refers to our direct experience. However, sensation is not just a simple reflection, but a mixture (Mr. Dongsun calls it "creator"). What appears in sensation, such as color, is not really something like that, but only the result of mixing. The mind "is only a series of increasingly higher syntheses." Sensation is the result of the mind's lowest-level synthesis of external objects. Discrimination is still indispensable in direct experience. As Kant said: "Intuition without conception is blind; conception without intuition is empty."</p>
<p>Third, perception refers to the entire realm of personal experience. Perception puts sensation into a whole realm and makes a "view." Perception has three characteristics. (1) Perception is organized by several sensations, such as the perception of distance is coordinated by visual and motion sensation. (2) In addition to sensation, "imagination" is also added to perception. (3) Sensation only provides perception with materials, while perception has its own whole realm. Therefore, perception is also a "creator."</p>
<p>Fourth, concepts come gradually from perception. According to Mr. Zhang's argument, "the origin of concepts is due to the gradual fading of the shadows of concrete things into symbols, and the subsequent transfer of symbols leads to generality, which is called 'universals.'" However, the origin of this concept is not completely limited to concrete objects in perception, but more importantly, it comes from the relationships between concrete objects. When these possible relationships are transformed into concepts, there are logical concepts. These concepts can be transformed into categories. And the appearance of categories and the formation of culture are just one thing. A certain culture includes certain categories. Therefore, concepts can also be said to be a manifestation of a certain culture.</p>
<p>As for talking about the "mind," it "is only an action, and the result of its action is the construction layer by layer. Each layer of creator has its special function. Therefore, there is no boundary from direct personal experience to indirect speculation, but only a consistent construction." But there is a law between the layers: that is, the subsequent synthesis must include the previous synthesis, and the lower layer is absorbed by the upper layer, so the part only provides materials to the whole. But the upper layer has the power to dominate the lower layer, which is "the whole determines the molecule." Therefore, Zhang Dongsun said: "The external object controls sensory perception, and sensory perception controls concepts. Conversely, concepts explain sensory perception, and sensory perception includes the external object." This is Mr. Zhang's interactionism.</p>
<p>Why do we have this knowledge? This is because knowledge can make us adapt more easily. So knowledge itself is a kind of life value. Culture is the process of human adaptation to the environment. Therefore, culture can be said to be the objectification and shaping of knowledge.</p>
<p>The second part of this book explains how knowledge is limited by culture. Mr. Zhang elaborates on this point from four aspects: language, logic, philosophy, and social thought. First, Mr. Zhang believes that the language of a nation is determined by the history and culture of the nation. The mind of a nation can be seen from the characteristics of the abstract nouns used by the nation. For example, Chinese language has many moral nouns, which shows that Chinese thought focuses on personnel matters. Second, logic does not express human rationality, but only adjusts the shortcomings of language. Different cultures have different language grammars, so different cultures also have different logics. Different cultural needs lead to changes in the appearance of logic. Third, philosophy is the highest theoretical knowledge, and its function also lies in the convenience of adaptation. So it is easily dominated by our own attitude. Therefore, the discussion of philosophers only gives us emotional satisfaction, so as to adjust culture and turn back to change our attitude towards dealing with the world. Third, social thought (such as morality, politics, economics, philosophy, religion, etc.) is due to the social need for individuals to unite. Social thought is used to maintain people's hearts. Therefore, when society has different needs, there are different social thoughts. Therefore, Mr. Zhang gave a definition of truth: all theoretical knowledge that can meet the social needs of a certain era is truth.</p>
<p>The third part of this book wants to prove the previous theme with the characteristics of Chinese thought. Chinese and Western cultures have different types, so they have different thought types, because thought is only an explanation of culture. Here Mr. Zhang pointed out four characteristics of Chinese philosophy (1) Chinese philosophers do not talk about ontology and causal principles, but only talk about possible changes and their mutual relationships, because Chinese society has an ethical order, which requires individuals to fulfill their responsibilities to maintain the whole of society, and philosophy provides a reasonable defense for this order of seeking mutual relationships from various changes. (2) There is no distinction between species and categories in Chinese philosophy, because the Chinese believe that the individual molecules in the whole are only related symbols, not natural kinds. (3) Chinese philosophy fundamentally does not pursue "the ultimate reality," because Chinese thinkers only solve political problems and social problems, and the concept of "essence" cannot be inserted at all. (4) Chinese philosophy does not talk about ontology, but only about the whole, advocating the unity of heaven and man and the unity of all things.</p>
<p>These ideological systems are all adapted to the social needs of the time. The ancient Chinese thinkers belonged to the class of rulers and assistants to the rulers, not the ruled, so the problems they thought about were only "the way of inner sage and outer king," not the life skills of ordinary people. Zhang Dongsun said: "Chinese culture focuses on morality and cultivation, only because the books passed down are specially for the scholar class to read." "The intention is to train scholars, so that their conduct is particularly more arduous and outstanding than ordinary people; then they can go out to save the world and make the monarch like Yao and Shun." After the unification of Qin, the emperors needed assistants who were just docile people, and Confucianism could best produce such people, so the thoughts after Qin were dominated by Confucianism. Therefore, in the pre-Qin era, the task of the scholars was to assist politics; after the unification of Qin, the mission of the scholars was to reconcile the interests of the people and the interests of the royal family, so that the monarch would not become tyrannical and unscrupulous; the deeper the social turmoil in the Song and Ming dynasties, the more the scholar class needed to strengthen their confidence in their own work, and the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties did this work. By the Qing Dynasty, the monarch was already a foreign race, and the scholars no longer needed to make that kind of loyal admonition that would sacrifice their lives for righteousness, so they tended to study "practical learning," only making plans for the life problems of ordinary people, and no longer making the effort to "make the monarch like Yao and Shun."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zhang used the different categories used in Chinese and Western philosophy to explain the differences between Chinese and Western cultures. In the comparison, first, Western categories are more complicated than Chinese categories, so Chinese thought is relatively simple; second, Chinese and Western categories are also different in type, Chinese thought pays more attention to the aspect of realization, while Western thought pursues the ontology behind the phenomenon, Chinese thought is ethical, and Western thought is speculative.</p>
<p>In short, human thought is the product of social culture, and the development of social culture is limited by thought, and this cycle is inevitable for any research.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>From the above simple introduction, we can see that three very important changes have taken place in Mr. Zhang's ideological system. First, Mr. Zhang has abandoned the claim of pluralism; second, he used culture and sociology to explain the composition of knowledge; third, he admitted that knowledge has the value of helping human adaptation and survival. These changes are all very gratifying, because they all conform to the trend of new ideas. Now I will supplement these three points.</p>
<p>In the past, Mr. Zhang advocated pluralistic epistemology. He once analyzed knowledge into five factors: order, sensation, concept, postulate, and format. He said, "I think that at the root, there are five kinds that are independent of each other. From sensation, we cannot know external objects; from format, we cannot know sensation; from postulate, we cannot know format; from concept, we cannot know postulate... because I admit that sensation, category, postulate, and concept have their own sources and cannot be merged." At that time, I made the following criticism of Zhang Dongsun's claim: "Mr. Zhang did not give us the reasons why the above five levels cannot be independent. Mr. Zhang said that they have their own sources, but he did not tell us what the sources are... I mean, although the organization of knowledge cannot lack order, sensation, concept, postulate, and format, I further argue that order, sensation, concept, postulate, and format are a whole, interrelated organic whole. These five kinds of raw materials in the knowledge organization are pulling one hair to move the whole body. Without order, there can be no sensation; without sensation, there can be no concept; without concept, there can be no postulate; without postulate, there is no way to understand the format. This kind of bottom-up correlation, I think can be used in Morgan's emergent evolution theory of 'internal inclusion.' Conversely, the format dominates the postulate; the postulate dominates the concept; the concept dominates the sensation; the sensation dominates the order. I use the relationship of 'superiority' to explain this top-down practical effect. If the knowledge organization does not have the two relationships of superiority and internal inclusion, it is just a plate of loose sand, and there is no so-called knowledge at all... We believe that these raw materials in the knowledge organization are interrelated and complete." I made this opinion to Mr. Zhang in May 1935. Mr. Zhang's restatement of pluralistic epistemology, published in October 1936, mentioned that these levels are mixed with each other, but did not accept the two relationships of "internal inclusion" and "superiority" that I proposed. When he wrote the book "Knowledge and Culture" (April 1940), we can say that he completely accepted my proposal. Because he himself said: "Here I can be said to be the 'bottom-up principle' of the emergent evolution theory of Sichuan. However, he used it on the structure of the universe, and I used it on the structure of knowledge." This is completely consistent with what I said in the article "The Organization of Knowledge" in the Philosophical Review in August 1936: "I borrowed two concepts from Morgan's emergent evolution theory. Because I think these two relationships can indeed explain the organization of knowledge."</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Zhang has gone out of Kant, not only seeking the creation of knowledge from the order of logic, but also explaining the individual's mind from the social mind, and explaining the type of thought with cultural types. This has already entered Hegel's circle. The self is composed of the non-self. Of course, Mr. Zhang is unwilling to go out of the scope of epistemology and follow Hegel to talk about the phenomenology of the universe, but we may still apply Hegel's dialectic to explain that the development of knowledge cannot be separated from the social background. Mr. Zhang is walking this road, but he has not clearly admitted it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Mr. Zhang believes that there is no knowledge that is useless, and all knowledge is convenient for adaptation. He said that truth is the theoretical knowledge that is suitable for the needs of the times. This is the theme of Dewey's instrumentalism, see his book "Logic." The meaning in knowledge is related to human needs. Human beings are born without innate format, but only desires and needs. Meaning occurs in human behavior that constantly adapts to the environment and changes the environment to meet their own needs. Mr. Zhang seems to have not fully applied this point, but in general, it is enough to satisfy us.</p>
<p>There are other more delicate and specialized places that seem to be worth discussing, but this short space cannot allow it, so I will have to talk about it when I have the opportunity later. Finally, there is one point that is worth mentioning in particular, that is, Mr. Zhang expresses such complex thoughts as if he knows every treasure, and talks about them endlessly, making people never tire of reading them, and the words are clear and not astringent, which is not easy to achieve in philosophical writing. The appendix at the end of the book has been published successively in magazines such as the Oriental Magazine, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<h3>A Good Example for the Publishing Industry: British Press Baron Lord Northcliffe</h3>
<p>— Qinghe</p>
<p>Anyone who studies journalism knows about the British Lord Northcliffe. He is the owner of the London Times. His success has five reasons:</p>
<p>(1) He had a smart father and a wise mother.</p>
<p>(2) He has great courage, likes to be proactive, and has the talent and patience to endure.</p>
<p>(3) He always has concrete plans and unchangeable policies in his work.</p>
<p>(4) He focuses on the overall situation of the business, and does not spend effort on trivial matters.</p>
<p>(5) He was the first person in Britain to recognize the great power of newspapers.</p>
<p>His starting point is also very interesting, because a friend of his father gave him a box of toys, which contained some lead type, which aroused his great interest, although his father hoped that he would become a lawyer.</p>
<p>At the age of fifteen, he went to work as a reporter in a newspaper office. At the age of sixteen, he was able to write short articles and send them to major newspapers for publication.</p>
<p>Only novel things can attract his attention, such as bicycles, engines, and buildings. In 1888, he founded a weekly magazine called "Answers." In 1894, he bought the Evening News for £25,000. At that time, the newspaper's business was failing, and it had lost £300,000. After he took over, it earned £14,000 in the first year.</p>
<p>In 1896, he also published the Daily Mail, which is now the most widely circulated daily newspaper. In 1908, he became the owner of the London Times. This newspaper can influence public opinion. Lincoln once said that it is as great as the Mississippi River in the United States.</p>
<p>He gets up two hours earlier than anyone else. At seven o'clock, he has already read the newspapers of the day and knows the comments for tomorrow. By the time of breakfast, most of the important things of the day have been taken care of.</p>
<p>His biggest claim is: "A person must constantly learn and must not be satisfied with the current position."</p>
<h3>A Small Statement Regarding the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>This column is determined to achieve the following points from now on:</p>
<p>(1) Do not review books and publications related to ourselves, so as to avoid the suspicion of self-promotion.</p>
<p>(2) Books and publications and book reviews sent by relatives and friends will be treated the same as those sent by unfamiliar readers, please do not be offended.</p>
<p>(3) Welcome the publishing industry to provide news, express opinions, and send books and publications for review; however, the space in this column is limited, and it is impossible to review every book, nor is it intended to review every book ★ The books introduced and criticized in this column are hoped to be relatively important. But this does not mean that books not reviewed in this column are unimportant or have no value. Please do not misunderstand.</p>
<p>This column welcomes external contributions except for special contributors.</p>
<h3>Recommendation to Young People: A Progressive Philosophy of Life</h3>
<p>— Yang Congjun</p>
<p>"A New Outlook on Life" by Luo Jialun, Commercial Press Edition</p>
<p>I often feel that among the vast youth population, there is often a lack of motivation in life. Many young people lack a consistent life ideal, let alone a central belief. They have no correct understanding of life. What they have come to this world for, and what they should do for the people, seem to be rarely considered. Many people say that today's young people, whether in their daily lives or in their work performance, cannot find enthusiasm. Everyone lacks faith in life and floats along with the turbulent times in a state of decline and languor.</p>
<p>In an era of historical turning points and the transition between the old and the new world, our most urgent task is to rescue young people from the abyss of decline and languor and infuse their lives with some of the light of life. We believe that those who care about education and culture should first take on the responsibility of "relieving the intellectual famine of young people." We must guide young people on the correct path forward in the multi-faceted journey of life, and not let them wander at crossroads again.</p>
<p>Guiding young people to absorb the ideas of a progressive philosophy of life can solve the intellectual famine of young people. The meaning of life must be understood correctly, and the purpose of life must be understood clearly. Romain Rolland said: "Life is a battle." Yes, people living in a great era should fight against real life with the spirit of battle. Losing the power of battle will dim the light of life. But how to fight life and how to prepare the power of battle requires establishing a fighting philosophy of life, a progressive and perfect outlook on life.</p>
<p>The recently published "A New Outlook on Life" by the Commercial Press is indeed a suitable work for young people. The author, Mr. Luo Jialun, is a senior in the educational and academic circles and a mentor of the life thoughts of the entire youth group. Although his book is only a little over a hundred pages long, it can represent a correct philosophy of life. Luo uses his unique insight to see through the entire panorama of life. In this turbulent era, the reason why young people generally lack motivation in life, are so decadent and languid, lack enthusiasm, feel confused and indecisive, and fall into worries and depressions is that they have not established a correct outlook on life. Therefore, young people today must re-evaluate the value of life based on their own knowledge and experience. Luo's work first tells us that the new philosophy of life does not rely solely on authority and tradition, but must examine the demands of reality and the conditions of life with reason. The new philosophy of life does not only talk about conscience, but about the cultivation of the entire life and its character and demeanor, and the establishment of an ideal life from experience and habit. Luo also pointed out the importance of the value of life. The old values should naturally not be completely obliterated, but they must be re-evaluated to become new value standards to realize the ideal of a complete life.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole book, we can discover a central idea: to improve life and transform life. The author encourages us to pursue a lofty and great life, a solemn and magnificent life. He believes that life is dynamic because the universe is dynamic and constantly moving. Life is a part of the universe, so it is also dynamic and constantly moving. As the author said, if we shatter the static view of life and rebuild a dynamic view of life, then how great, lofty, solemn, and magnificent life should be! The author further points out the creative view of life and the altruistic view of life. He wants us to constantly develop creative wisdom, not only to live up to our own lives but also to live up to the legacy of the wisdom of the sages. The altruistic view of life is to integrate the "individual" and the "group" to increase the strength of life and expand the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Seeing that young people are languid and weak, lacking vitality and enthusiasm, Luo puts forward the "life of strength," urging us to constantly work hard upward, forward, and outward. At the same time, he also expounds on the idea of "As Heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for self-improvement," urging us to always be the masters of our will, not slaves. Creating a new life must start with creating a new atmosphere. Luo is indeed justified in this point. The evolution of society does not rely on the majority of people who are immersed in the present to rise up, but on a few independent and outstanding people to transcend. A mediocre life is indeed not worth living. We should have the awareness and confidence to establish a new philosophy of life. When Luo wrote these articles, the Chinese nation was suffering an unprecedented disaster. He said a lot to encourage young people to carry forward the national spirit and establish a fighting philosophy of life, which is enough to cultivate broad and deep emotions and revive the decadent and declining spirit!</p>
<p>This book is divided into sixteen chapters. It was originally a systematic lecture series given by the author to all students after the National Central University moved west. It looks like a series of separate articles, but because the author has a consistent cultivation of the philosophy of life, we cannot find any disharmony or inconsistency in thought. I feel that during the Anti-Japanese War, this was a major achievement in Luo's thinking. We always feel that the traditional specialized books that classify and list the philosophy of life are too "textbook-like," but Luo's "A New Outlook on Life" corrects this defect. He can base it on the famous sayings and exemplary deeds of Chinese and foreign thinkers and focus on discussing the parts that are considered lacking or poor in Chinese national thinking and life, and expound on many new ideas - ideas full of power. The author also admits that this book is a summary of his personal efforts to think. I believe the author did this work with boundless enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The author can also use his clear and lively writing style to express the essence of his thoughts, so this book is very smooth to read and does not have the dryness of ordinary philosophical books. Here, I would like to quote a few paragraphs from his "Preface":</p>
<p>"The vast amount of red fresh blood, the torrential rain of shrapnel, and the unprecedented flood stirred up by the times, can they not make us, who stand at the critical juncture of survival, have a new examination and understanding of the entire problem of life?</p>
<p>"We want to survive, and we want to survive meaningfully, so how can we not pursue the meaning of survival and the ways to achieve this meaningful survival?</p>
<p>"In this creative universe composed of true time and space, our lives are dynamic, real, and even more creative. Our thinking cannot go backwards. We cannot retreat with the times, nor can we roll forward with the times. We must grasp the giant wheel of the times and consciously push it towards our glorious ideals.</p>
<p>"We must wield our swords to cut off the rotten. We must clear away the toxins of outdated, decadent, weak, dependent, cowardly, and all erroneous thoughts and lives. It is not only sweeping the place to cultivate new muscles, but also expecting to grow new bones.</p>
<p>"This great era requires us to have powerful thoughts, powerful actions, and powerful lives."</p>
<p>After reading the above paragraphs, we can know with what enthusiasm the author wants to influence the young men and women who are wandering in the vast society. I once again recommend this collection of progressive philosophical essays, "A New Outlook on Life," to the hopeful sons and daughters of China with a sincere attitude.</p>
