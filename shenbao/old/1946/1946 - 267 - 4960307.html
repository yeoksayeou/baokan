<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕確息，蔣主席此次蒞贛，在勝利後，尙屬首次，復感於江西民衆之熱烈歡迎，故擬略事勾留，返京期或尙有數日。</p>

<p>主席訓詞全文</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌廿三日電〕蔣主席廿三日上午十時出席江西省會各界歡迎元首大會，訓詞原文發表如次！</p>
<p>王主席·江西各界父老·同胞·軍官同志·靑年子弟們，今天中正在抗戰勝利以後來到南昌，與我們江西各界父老同胞相見，實在是我平生最値得紀念，也是我惑覺得最快樂，最足自慰的一天。</p>
<p>偉大的貢獻</p>
<p>今天在塲的各位父老同胞，大多數都還記得，民國十五年的時候，本人率領國民革命軍由廣東北伐，經過長沙，旋即擊潰江西方面的軍閥，克復了南昌，所以南昌是我們北伐前進的第一個根據地，而同時，江西男女老幼同胞，人人擁護國民政府，効忠國民革命，對於北伐的貢獻，實在是非常偉大，可以說後來北伐之所以能如此迅速完成，大部份是由於我們江西全省同胞輸財輸力，竭誠擁護的結果，這是本席廿年來對於江西同胞時刻所不忘的一件大事。自從民國廿年以後到廿三年，江西全省陷於長期的匪亂，可以說當時的江西沒有一片乾凈土，同胞的生活，眞是如水益深，如火益熱。我初到南昌的時侯，一般社會對於匪亂的恐怕，幾乎比洪水猛獸還要厲害，在這一個期間，我們江西遭受匪亂而犧牲的同胞，總計起來，至少在五百萬人以上，至於財產的損失，更是不可勝數。然自民國廿二年實行新生活運動以來，對怕匪的心理，完全改變了，當時，江西男女老幼，個個人不但不怕匪，而且對匪這種殺人放火，慘無人道的行動，只有痛恨刺骨，我們江西的同胞，無論遭遇了怎樣的艱難困苦，顚沛流離，其對於政府的忠誠，革命的擁護，眞是再接再勵，自始至終信仰政府，服從命令，共同一致，誓復匪仇，所以不待二年，那樣滔天的大鍋，就撲滅了。廿三年的冬季，社會的秩序，亦就漸漸的安定下來了，由此可見，我們江西同胞，人人都具有革命的熱誠，都能保鄉保國，愛國自愛，眞不愧爲現代的國民。不幸到了民國廿六年，日寇發動了蘆溝橋事變，於是我們中國展開了全面的抗戰，八年之間，江西全省的同志同胞，在政府領導之下，服從命令，始終一致和敵人作殊死的鬥爭，由此可見我們江西對於抗戰的勝利，更有其偉大的功績。各位都記得，我們全國抗戰的國策和後來一切抗戰的計劃，都是在我們江西的廬山決定的，可以說，江西就是抗戰勝利的發祥地。總之，江西對於近廿年來國民革命的發展，實有不可磨滅的貢獻，在中國革命歷史上，實佔有最光榮的一頁，這種歷史的光榮，我們全省同胞，必須一致愛護，發揚光大，使之永垂不朽。</p>
<p>以新運精神　建贛爲模範省</p>
<p>但是本人此次來到江西，適値江西在長期抗戰之後，地方殘破，民生痛苦，不勝其悲痛憂傷。然而本人根據以往的經騐，確信我們江西同胞建設的精神和恢復的力量，比我們全中國任何一省的同胞都無遜色，我們江西從十九年起，經過六年長期的匪禍，但到廿四年匪患敉平的時候，不僅社會的秩序迅即恢復，而且農工商業各界都有一種欣欣向榮的氣象，尤其是建設事業，更是一日千里，就是自二十四年至二十六年兩年之內，完成了贛浙，贛湘兩條鐵路，完成了全省公路各幹錢，而且修築了這條贛江大橋，其他敎育，經濟的建設，更是不遑枚舉，這種偉大的建設力量，是我們應該特別自勉而加以發揮的。我相信，江西全省同胞，如果能够在省政府領導之下，如同過去一樣，共同一致，埋頭苦幹，則三年之內，必能建設江西省之成爲全國的模範省。</p>
<p>講到這裏，還有一點要提起各位同胞的注意：我們江西過去對於革命抗戰與剿匪所以能够有如此偉大的成就，主要的原因，是由於我們有一個精神的力量，這個精神的力量是什麼？就是民國二十二年二月十九日我在南昌提倡的新生活運動，這個運動的要義，是納禮義廉恥四維於衣食住行的日常生活之中，由日常生活的改革，而達到提高民族精神，發揚民族道德的目的，這個運動亦發祥於你們的江西，後來普遍推行到全國，我認爲這個運動對於當時剿匪的成功，與今日抗戰的勝利，實在有最大的影響，今後建國的工作，較之過去的抗戰，尤爲艱鉅，因此，我更希望我們江西的同胞，一本開始實行新生活運動時代的精神，明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律，刻苦耐勞，埋頭努力，來完成我們新江西的建設。</p>
<p>助退伍軍官　繼續努力建國</p>
<p>最後，我來到南昌，還見到我們軍官總隊的學員，受到一般同胞的歡迎和愛護，彼此親愛精誠，互助合作，心裏更覺得十分快慰，各位都知道，這二十年來，我們國民革命軍全體官兵，無時無刻不在犧牲苦鬥之中，可以說跟着我統帥作戰，沒有過一天安樂的日子。他們在北伐之後，繼之以剿匪，剿匪之後，繼之以抗戰，其勛勞功績，都値得全國同胞的愛護與敬佩，永誌不忘，然而抗戰勝利之後足有十五萬以上的軍官，在政府一令之下，遵命退役，拋棄了現有的軍職，犧牲了崇高的地位，這件大事，可說我們中國自有歷史以來所未曾有的偉績，這是我們中國政治，軍事上最大的進步，也是我們中國全體軍人救國的人格與革命的精神最高的表現，這就可以證明今天眞正愛國愛民的軍隊和軍官，絕無自私自利的觀念，只有一片純潔光明的心地，効忠國家，愛護同胞，所以我們同胞對於這些服從命令犧牲自我的國家浪伍軍官，必須一本過去二十年來擁護政府，愛戴國民革命軍的精神，來愛護他們，幫助他們，使他們在結束其軍事生活之後，仍能繼續爲國效力，參加建國的工作，如此，纔能表示我們一般同胞崇德報功的至意。我們軍官同袍，更要自愛自重，刻苦守分，來做社會的表率，國民的模範，乃能眞正完成我們國民革命軍人抗戰建國的使命。</p>
<p>中正今天和我們江西父老同胞相見，心中愉快萬分，沒有其他的方法可以表達我心中的感慰，惟有一腔熱血，一片純誠，願與我江西同胞互相勉勵，爲建設新江西與新中國而努力，謹祝江西全省同胞　康進步。</p>
<h3>主席茶會招待來賓　接見蔡署長指示救濟工作</h3>
<p>〔中央社南昌廿三日電〕蔣主席廿三日下午四時半在省府禮堂招待中外來賓茶會，到聯總駐贛代表鄧肯，天主堂總司鐸施美德，基督敎牧師高綏福，士紳彭程萬，歐陽武及周故軍長渾元與胡故師長祖玉後裔周靈元，胡德馨等百餘人，席間主席起立致詞，對江西之建設再三致意，略謂：建設事業必由小而大，由近而遠。江西之建設應自南昌始，全國之建設，應自江西始，江西以過去文化之昌明，人民之聰慧，加以物質條件之優厚，若能輔以現代之科學組織等技術，則建設成績必可一日千里。主席最後勉江西全省黨政軍各界，在王主席領導之下，共同一致埋頭努力，相信三五年內必可使江西成爲全國模範省。主席對聯總之工作，予以稱許，並希望大家效法西人之工作精神與方法，詞畢，全塲一致鼓掌，茶會至六時許盡歡而散。</p>
<p>〔又電〕蔣主席廿三日接見行總贛分署長蔡孟堅，指示救濟工作甚詳。又廿三日茶會中，主席對聯總駐贛代表鄧肯及所屬外籍工作人員之工作精神，及其與行總分署取得密切配合，甚爲贊許，幷表示農田水利甚爲重要、應加努力。</p>
<h3>張厲生向本報記者談　政府對時局態度　以理智判斷事實以忍耐期待結果</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕張厲生廿三日答本報記者詢問商談形勢時，略稱：和平商談目前雖形擱淺，但各方仍不斷接觸，吾人當以理智判斷事實，以忍耐期待結果，相信終有成就希望。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕司徒大十一時其私人顧問傅涇波與來訪之皮宗敢氏談約三刻鐘，餘無活動。據各方觀察，目前似正靜待蔣主席返京後，始能有所進展。共產黨代表團發言人今晚稱：周恩來先生在滬，正等待消息，一俟軍事三人小組會議召開有期，周當立即返京。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城等五人　昨舉行談話會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政治商談過程中，昨經共產黨提出第二次備忘錄後，今日除共產黨代表無往返外　政府代表仍互有接觸，顯示在期待主席返京期中，政府方面仍欲尋覓妥適辦法，以達和平之途徑。廿三日晨國府紀念週後，吳鼎富·吳鐵城·邵力子·彭學沛·王世杰五人曾舉行一談話會、就當前時局予以硏討。中午吳　　復至普陀路陳總長公館，與陳　談甚久，並同進午餐，衆信政府代表正就共產黨之備忘錄內所提要求加以研討，並聞吳鐵城·張厲生·兪大維諸氏，廿四日晚將在美大使館晚餐，並談論目的局勢。</p>
<h3>馬使與兪大維　商談一般問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使廿三日上午八時三刻，在行館接見兪大維，長談至十一時五十分始止，據兪稱：彼等所談仍爲一般時局問題，然衆信當係就共產議之備忘錄內容加以硏究。該項備忘錄主旨，在軍事三人會議之召開，兪則爲三人會政府代表徐永昌之代表也。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使及司徒雷登大使兩調人之努力，暫時已陷於停頓，可靠方面謂，馬司二人暫時均不擬再行發動調處，預料在蔣主席返京以前，僵局不致有任何改變。關於共方所提之備忘錄，馬師在未與蔣主席交換意見以前，不擬予以答覆。</p>
<h3>我爲貨秈基金簽字國　匯率變動受限制　經濟專家論貨幣貶値</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕官方雖鄭重聲明外匯率決不變更，然南京之外匯市塲仍依上海市塲而變動，馬路交易今日行情爲美鈔一元易法幣三五五〇元，大票僅能易得三四〇〇元，一般經營美鈔者似均看高。據某與中國貨幣制度有密切關係之經濟專家稱：中國乃國際貨幣基金之簽字國，該會曾於一月前規定各會員國應於發出最後通知三月以內，將其國幣對各重要金本位貨幣（即美元，英鎊，及法郞）之永久性穩定交換率，向該會登記，其目的爲防止各國國幣在規定之限期以前，再有重大貶値之事發生，迨至所定限期屆滿之後，中國及其他每一簽字國均須受其已登記之匯率之束縛，若國內局勢必須使貨幣再度貶値時，其所貶之價値亦不得再超過十分之一，且此一調整至少須於登記後六月再得實行。負責觀察家深知百分之十三再度調整，實不足以應付可能經常發生之貶値，因此在兩閱月內，實有再行宣佈一次最後貶値之必要、若不幸於此一貶値以後，情形仍每况愈下則中國仍有向國際貨幣基金會撤退貶値限制之權，然此舉不啻向全世界宣佈國家之破產，當非任何國家所願爲也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津二十三日電〕上海謠傳法幣對美元官定匯率，即將再度調整後，此間公開市塲上美元市價已創新高峯，截至目前爲止，最高價爲三六一〇元。</p>
<h3>隴海路東段　明日起通車</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕隴海路東段開封至徐州間鐵路，日前遭共軍破壞，損失慘重，近日軍事好轉，該段搶修工程進展至爲神速，一週之間竟將一百九十四里損壞路綫整個修復，交部二十三日已接徐州電話，該路二十五日通車。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕據悉，交通當局正考慮延長隴海西段至蘭州，並派專家赴天水實地硏究。路綫西展後，將頗有利於玉門油礦之開發，及西北邊防之鞏固。</p>
<h3>馬占山調新職</h3>
<p>東北保安副長官</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿三日電〕十二戰區副司令長官兼東北挺進軍總司令馬占山，現調任東北保安副司令長官。</p>
<h3>傅作義由綏飛抵故都　平舉行重要會議　察東前綫昨起發生接觸</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕張家口之戰，　　在即，今晚北平軍事當局，有重要會商。第十二戰區傅作義長言，今日乘專機由綏飛平，下午　　半抵達此間。平綏鐵路靑　　方面，今日尙無戰爭業已　　之消息傳來。綏東晋北之戰，漸　過去，聶榮臻部一萬三千人，已由大同沿平綏綫竄陽高，蕭克　　葉寗直綫撤往張家口。　　　　西南由興隆德慶，竄來共軍　　人，企圖威脅國軍側背、並　壞交通。</p>
<p>〔本報北　廿三日電〕確患、國軍三路　攻張垣，今晚將決定步驟、並即纔正式開始前進，北平十一戰　長官部今晚有重要軍事會議，　　一戰區相呼應，其他重要軍事長官，預定今日下午飛抵平，參與此會。又停留於南口之察省政府保安團隊，已接通知，今晚隨軍前進。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕確息，察東共軍第一道防綫之康莊左右前方，昨起與國軍接觸頻繁，若干小據點，已入國軍掌握，此爲國軍正式進軍之序幕，康莊已入國軍大砲射程，一旦開始爭奪，可迅速攻下。聞國軍今後採取之新戰術，爲使重要據點之共軍，白動退却。又平古綫順義西方十三公里之校各莊，昨晚被由冀東調來之共軍四個團攻佔，戰鬥頗激烈，現國軍正反攻，該股共軍行動，似在牽制平綏路國軍前進，並威脅平古路。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二十三日電〕新收復之各路綫，正積極搶修平綏路西段車，已通豐鎭，日內可通大可，平古綫今修至石匣附近，又北寗路唐山開平間，今晨被地　炸毀路軌，旋即修復。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社張家口廿二日電〕外傳此間飛機塲已被破壞，此說並不確實，蓋本日尙有北平執行部郵機一架，安全降落此間，並載去政府組之無綫電發報員一人，因渠在此患扁桃腺炎，頗爲嚴重。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社張家口廿二日電〕此間每日除至均有空襲警報一次而外，在表面上並無任何可見之緊張跡象，大部分居民，亦仍在度其正常與平和生活，政府進攻張家口，似有一觸即發可能。</p>
<h3>有史以來之偉績　十五萬人齊解甲　軍人的是好男兒　主席讚揚第六軍官總隊</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌廿三日電〕蔣主席廿三日晨在南昌省會各界歡迎元首大會席上，於慰勉江西同胞後，曾公開讚揚第六軍官總隊儘大之成就，對該總隊一萬以上之編餘軍官與南昌廿萬市民精誠團結，親密合作，甚能獲得各方之好評，表示非常快慰。主席言至此，並以動人之演詞特別提及勝利以後政府按照旣定方針編整國軍，以完成軍事復員大計，在一個命令發出以後，整軍工作立見責施，截至今日止，至少已有十五萬軍官遵令退職，進入各個軍官總隊，接受適合建國需要之各種轉業訓練，自有歷史以來所未曾有的偉績（大鼓掌）。中華民國之軍人，均能了然今日建國任務之重要，我們的建國工作，一完可以完成（全塲十萬民衆大鼓掌），這的確是我們中華民族五千年來稀有的奇蹟。</p>
<p>當記者在本月十三日訪問靑雲譜第六軍官總隊，探詢該總隊所屬各大隊業科訓練，轉業敎學方針，各軍官轉業志願及其人數，編餘軍官入隊受訓之情緒，編餘軍官對於國是前途之看法，編餘軍官對本身出路之想法，記者不禁向同行諸人說，政府爲了澈底實施軍事復員大計，擬訂的編餘軍官轉業辦法，古今中外史無前例，較之漢唐時代「杯酒釋兵權裂土封藩」那種落後的思想，眞是高明一萬倍，進步五千年，我們四萬五千萬局胞，不要口頭擁護元首，服從元首，應該從元首發明的救國建國大計，去體騐元首的苦心與德意，擁護元首硏訂勇邁漢唐，智逾歐美的整軍復員大計，因爲漢高祖，唐太宗裁編將士，沒有轉業善後的辦法，歐美有復業辦法，無轉業訓練，提高中華民族的武德，以解決中華民族五千年來最危險，晨令人頭痛的一個裁兵問題。</p>
<p>主席這次來南昌，聽到並看到我國軍官轉業訓練的一切情形後，非常高興，曾當面慰勉第六軍官總隊長陳沛將軍和三位總隊附，七位大隊長，爲各編餘軍官盡力解除困難，編餘軍官本身及其家庭如有重要困難，可由陳沛將軍代爲呈報主席，設法解決，這一個消息公布後，今天參加歡迎元首大會八千編餘軍官，雖然來去步行五小時，站立兩小時，一點兒也沒有感覺疲勞。他們之中，有的曾任總副司令，有的曾任軍師長，可是現在吃的，住的，穿的，行的，等於一個兵，當大軍官能重過士兵生活，而甚之如飴，這不是退步，而是進步，編入第六軍官總隊，繼續接受學術兩科，言及轉業訓練的軍官，九月份人數計有步九四二八人，騎四八人，砲一四八人，工兵二四四人，輜重三六人，交通二一四人，土木一四人，憲警一二四人，政工二九八人，軍需三四九人，會計五三人，技術一一人，軍屬一五一人，軍醫二四三人，總計一一四五六人，就中編餘軍官轉業志願的如下列：交通二〇六人，工鐵郵航空電警政一九〇四人，新軍幹部一三三四人，兵役班一六人，行政官吏四八五人，農林　殖四四九人，深造四二〇人，勞動服勞三四五人，民衆義務敎育二一五人，礦廠管理一五三六人，金融財政三〇五人，留美五人，地方衛生二〇四人，陸大八〇人，官吏五四人，計九三三〇人，該總隊編餘人數階級，計如下述：中將一一人，少將七三人，上校五〇九人，少校八七六人，上尉二四〇〇人，中尉二一六二人，少尉二二九五人，准尉一一八九人。又查九月份第六軍官隊在隊受轉業訓練之軍官總數爲九七〇〇人，截至今日止，共撥人數的如下述：九月份總員九七〇〇人，退職離隊四四七人，志願赴東北一四二人，退役一九二九人，除役九人，撥省訓團二一〇〇人。（單獨轉業）農墾二四人，財政七四人，土地測量二二人。（調徐州）指定者四一人，未指定者三三〇人，參加水產訓練五七二人，新軍幹部二四一人，技術軍官三七五人，警員三三三人，軍官區八五六人，新聞　六一人。我們從上列各項統計敎字觀察，第六軍官總隊的組織與人數及其成就，可以想像國內其他廿五個總隊任務之重大，我們希望各個軍官總隊都有好的成績做出來，拿事實來打歪那班擁兵殃民新軍閥的嘴巴，我們現在僅就目前整軍的輝煌成果言，應該歡呼「十五萬人齊解甲，軍人的是好男兒」。</p>

<h3>蘇北局勢即可澄清　國軍緊縮包圍圈　南北兩綫正配合進展中</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿三日電〕兩淮經國軍收復後，共軍在蘇北已失主要據點。淮陰之戰爲蘇北局勢重要捩據點，該役共軍動員二十四團，由陳毅親自指揮，力團頑抗，國軍收復該城，使共軍傷亡兩萬以上，被俘達五千人，精銳已失去大半。繼展開淮安之戰，續殲共軍五千餘，共殘部恰如秋風落葉，已失戰鬥力，紛向漣水潰散，現國軍正向兩淮以東地區追擊中。蘇北南綫國軍，配合北綫進展，自揚泰各前綫，向共軍緊縮包圍圈，東台，機場，興化，髙郵，賓應及漣水共軍，已是全部動搖。記者今蒞臨徐州晤國軍某髙級將領，渠料蘇北前途，已可無大戰，國軍將於最短期內，澄清蘇北局勢。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣廿三日電〕國軍主力除在淮安城郊繼續掃蕩外，先頭部隊刻向車橋方面挻進中。</p>
<p>〔又電〕關係方面表示，兩淮之收復，予蘇北共軍致命之打擊，今後國軍可能分兵二路，一路進軍漣水，完成北方包圍網，一路將北下直薄髙賓，與揚泰方面國軍，取得聯絡，貫通運河堤，至此潛伏於蘇北中部湖沼地帶之共軍，將不戰自退。</p>
<p>〔又電〕東綫戰事仍無軍大進展，北上部臉尚滯留於賓安附近，海泰公路間橋樑及電訊設備，因共軍破壞過烈，一時尚難修復。小紀，樊川，興化一帶共軍，連日續向髙賓間增援，揚賓將死守運河堤，預料如共軍在運河堤再遭慘敗，或將續范公堤西之溝汶，力守該堤，如是共軍乃能有撤退之後路。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿三日電〕據官場消息，漣水沭陽溝雲一帶共軍，近日大肆將年輕之壯丁婦女等，完全俘虜，分向魯南及鹽阜移動，共俘虜地區，以漣沭交界之髙家溝附近爲最慘，所有青年壯丁婦女全被擄去，無一遺餘者，照目前情形觀察，共軍即將放棄漣水。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿三日電〕中共發言人王炳南本日談稱：中共軍隊將在全國授採取大規模遊擊戰術，除哈爾濱及張家口兩地外，中共軍將放棄一切據點。淮陰與淮安之失守，僅爲蘇北戰役之開端，今後中共軍或將被迫自賓應與髙郵撤退，亦未可必。</p>
<h3>蘇北難民賑粉　迄今未交到　主席已令行總速辦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕救濟蘇北難民麵粉五千噸，九月初曾由行總撥交蘇甯分署，迄今仍未交到，蘇北難民救濟會致使難民不能獲得實惠。主席在牯時，爲此曾令蔣署長，從速辦理，又行總五月份應撥蘇北難民救濟之麵粉。至今亦無著。</p>
<h3>魯省共軍調動忙　禹城開軍事會議</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿三日電〕共軍企圖在魯發動戰事，日曾顯著，政府據報共軍渤海軍區司令部已遷魯北禹城城內辦公，目前會舉行軍事會議，決定開始軍事活動，消滅黃河北岸國軍，並預謀破壞交通，爆炸黃河鐵橋，國軍已予以嚴防，魯南共軍調動仍忙，在兗州附近約萬餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕國軍現以曹縣，菏澤，城武，定陶，金鄉，單縣，濟甯七縣城爲基地，續向鄉區開展，清除殘餘共軍魯西局勢大定，流亡省外之各該縣連日民難，扶老攜幼，結伴遷鄉，觀歌之嚴載道，熱烈情緒，爲勝利後所僅見。兗州曲市附近之共軍，連日又向國軍進襲，其警旅十六團五百餘人，二十一日拂曉由泗河東岸分途向兗州附近金口灞及飛機場襲擊，經國軍迎頭痛擊，激戰約半小時，共軍斃三十餘人，餘仍向大柳樹陵城原地潰退。又共軍三百餘於二十日向濟甯東打彈廠之警戒部隊襲擊，當被國軍擊退。</p>
<h3>俞交長在紀念週報告　郵電將實行加價　鐵路與建修復分區進行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕中樞紀念週，廿三日上午九時舉行，戴院長傳賢主席，由交長俞大維報告最近交通，扼要分析鐵路，公路，水道，航空，郵電近況，俞氏道稱：目前交通，特別首重鐵路之興建與修復，正分西南西北區及以渤海路爲界之華南區與華北區進行，但因修路材料缺乏，運費太低，鐵路員工缺乏訓練等困難甚多，致工作進行，頗受影響，故亟謀劃修復戰時所建各地公路，以輔助鐵路之不足，同時鼓勵地方政府修路，尤以西南公路極爲重要，決努力維持。水道運輸，亦正亟謀改善，並整理港務。至於航空方面，目前最大困難，在於缺乏器材設備，飛機不足乃在其次，現蝕累不堪，非加價不足以維持，故擬至相當時候，決予加價，但不致嗇加過髙。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕記者晚訪交長俞大維，詢以郵電加價辦法，俞氏稱：加價勢在必行，但何時實行尚不定。詢是否廿四日政院會議可能提出？俞氏連稱〔不會〕。</p>

<p>巴黎和會進行以來，瞬已經月，迄未成立若何協議。各方關注，自至殷切。大戰甫停，對於重建歐洲的和平秩序，各國意見未能盡同，且亦不欲草率從事，這正是締造和平應有的現象。所以我們對於巴黎和會進行的滯緩，自不宜存著什麼失望的心情。在巴黎和會正在進行之際，我們先後看見有美國務卿，蘇聯外長，英國外長，先後遷離巴黎，或前往莫斯科，或視察德國的戰領區，或返歸倫敦；其後又看見有美國務卿貝爾納斯在德國的演說，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在和會小組委員會席上的演說，對於美國及蘇聯的外交政策各有所闡明。而在這個時候，美商務部長華萊士又在美發表演說，主張對蘇綏靖，於是興論嘩然，羣起責難，華萊士不得不掛冠而去。現在華萊士既已去職，由華萊士演說所引起的風波也漸歸於平靜，而些際四國外長卻又重集於巴黎，趜於停噸的巴黎和會可能復趜活躍，即擱置已久的外長會議，亦有重新召開的可能。是則經過了一小時期的停噸和動盪，巴黎又將成爲國際外交活動的中心。本於過去數星期來的發展，我們願作一番國際政治的展望。</p>
<p>停戰一年來的世界局勢，顯因戰事的停止而停止了戰時所有的協調。本來，這協調的維持，缺乏相當實際的基礎，而僅是一種戰時的妥協。爲了維持這戰時的妥協，就是主張國際正義的羅斯福也不惜自棄其所奉的原則與其所處的立場，而與蘇聯不特築起一道髙髙的鐵幕，而且還要在鐵幕外撒布其社會主義國家的「新民主」主義，戰後世界顯爲這種氣氛所籠罩。在這種情勢之下，華萊士主張回復到一種新的「光榮的孤立」，而將中國作爲「化外」，隔著太平洋大西洋以觀歐洲及遠東的星星之火，這種華萊士主義的出現，雖是著「新孤立主義」的形相，其實也有些承襲二將大戰以前英美綏靖政策的衣缽。因此，關於英美的對外政策，我們不能不於別方面求之。</p>
<p>美國務卿貝爾納斯在斯都伽特的演說，闡明了美國政府對戰後歐洲的開明政策。其後，英國戰時首相邱吉爾亦在瑞士發表演說，主張連立歐洲聯邦，以爲歐洲庶幾可以回復其繁榮。邱吉爾以在野之身，所含不能代表英政府意向，然當今在英執政的工黨，雖主張實行被馬列主義者認爲「不科學的」社會主義，宨與蘇聯的「新民主」主義不能同日而語，故邱吉爾的演說也可能代表英國一部分人民的意見。歐洲聯邦的理想，這在歐洲人心目中並不新奇。第一次大戰後，法國的政治家頗有主張建立歐洲聯邦的，然而當時的情勢，理想徒成夢想。現在歐洲又感受威脅，說不定歐洲人民會感覺到有這種組織的必要了，然而能否形成，亦尚在模糊影響之中。</p>
<p>這樣演進的結果，將使世界成爲一個世界呢，抑將變成兩個？在實際上，一個世界原僅是一種崇髙的理想，而現實的鴻溝是早就存在著的了！世界正是多事的時候，我們固然不顯見鴻溝的距離愈來愈闊，而且毋甯祈禱著，趁現在這個時候，大家應該將這條鴻溝填塞，可是在填塞這條鴻溝的努力上，我們有權要求，各大國都要爲人類全體的安全而各有所忍讓，決不能單靠我們一方面，甚至不惜把所崇奉的原則，也像羅斯福總統那樣爲了遷就現實而相犧牲，現在如何努力填塞這條鴻溝，就得看齊案巴黎的外長的成就。</p>
<h3>美蘇合作之門</h3>
<p>華萊士的辭職，本報前日已有論及。我們爲世界全局打算，固然覺得華氏的演說既不能代表美國政府的外交政策，則美政府爲求外對一致起見，自有請他下野的必要，但無論如何，總還是非常惋惜這件不幸事實的發生。因爲，美蘇合作之門，多少又像隔了一層簾幕。</p>
<p>我們在此，願　述另外一種看法：華萊士的外交政策是對蘇聯讓步，貝爾納斯的外交政策是對蘇聯強硬，這歧異很顯明的。讓步，是否就能夠得黨蘇聯的合作？強硬，是否就能夠得到蘇聯的屈服？這兩點，誰也不能預料。不過貝爾納斯的強硬政策，到今天爲止，似乎不但沒有使蘇聯敢做的象徵，反而使美蘇的壁壘日形尖銳。華萊士的外政策，站在美國人的地位設想，似乎也許有著嘗試的必要。</p>
<p>華萊士的演說和致杜魯門函件中最大的兩點，就是他對於美蘇因了政治經濟制度不同而互不相信的嚴重問題，除掉他本人「深信」可以解決而外，並沒有確切的把握。美蘇的對立，本報十九日社評曾經指出，是兩種民主主義的衝突，換言之，就是美國民主主義和蘇聯共產主義的衝突。華萊士對於美蘇調和的方案，純粹注重軍事和經濟，而忽略了這兩個人類政治崇髙的理想。華萊士本來是農業專家。又任商務部長，專門留心農業和商業的人，不夠偏重人類生活方面的浮面現象，容易忽略人類促進實現浮面現象的思想活動。</p>
<p>思想是現象的泉源，依照黑格爾的看法，人類精神隨著歷史的演進，到處隨時要求自身的實現。現在美蘇的鬥爭，世界兩大集團的鬥爭，不是原子彈和海軍基地港口的鬥爭，而兩種偉大思想主義要求自身實現的鬥爭。克林姆宮內十四位共產黨領袖，爲著要實現他們從馬克斯繼承下來的思想，任何代價在所不惜，任何手段都可採取，任何國際條約都不能束縛他們。在這種情形之下，除非美國社會根本革命，變成蘇聯式的「新民主」，美蘇的合作，依然是沒有把握的，即使華萊士本人，也並沒有告訴美國人多少把握。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯式的「新民主」美國人除極少數的共產黨員而外，是不歡迎的，不但資本家不歡迎，就是工人也不見得歡迎。美國今天是最繁榮的國家，人民生活程度髙過世界任何的角落；生活既然舒適，又享受髙度的民主自由，全世界的工人中間，美國工人最沒有共產革命的意識。而美國根本沒有希望；就是在其他的民主國家，除非在它自己武力範圍以內，也沒有希望，加像希臘公民投票就是一個明例。人類固然要生活，但是也要自由。蘇聯式的「新民主」最大的缺憾，就是人民沒有自由！</p>
<p>有人認爲華萊士的演說，是美國白宮的一種試探。美國政府是不願意戰爭的，是願意同蘇聯合作的，但是任何的合作，不是一方面的事情。美國社總統既然讓華萊士發表演說，如果蘇聯有城意合作的反響，美國對蘇的強硬外交政策，也未嘗不可以逐漸轉變。假如這一個觀察是不錯的話，那麼社魯門總統要求華萊士辭職，正是他在希望之後仍然失望的表現！因爲自從華萊士演說發表以後，蘇聯官方報紙除大捧華萊士大罵貝爾納斯以外，政府方面並無若何具體的表示。在蘇聯這樣準態度之下，杜魯門總統便沒有理由採納華萊士的建議，把原子彈秘密雙手貢獻在史達林元帥面前了。</p>
<p>我們對於華萊士的辭職，非常惋惜，因爲他一篇演說，的確一度打開了美蘇攜手合作之門，現在客人不來，華氏辭職，這道門似乎又重新關閉了。但是我們仍然希望這一道門隨時都可以再開，而且相信會有一天再開。在中國，更祈禱著美蘇合作之門早些洞開。美國執政的人，不妨多多認識蘇聯，研究共產黨思想的背景；蘇聯領袖，也不妨走出克林姆宮，看一看世界的真面目，在他們互相了解的時候，就是世界和平真正萌芽的時候。</p>
<h3>壓平髙利貸的必要</h3>
<p>髙利貸，是目前工商界所感到最棘手問題之一。</p>
<p>一面鬧著通貨膨脹，一面又覺得游資過剩，苦無出路。照常理論，此時拆息應當低落，不應該發生髙利貸。不過理論是理論，事實還是事實。此類矛盾的現象，在目前的經濟界中，不止這一件事。</p>
<p>於是四聯的銀根緊縮政策，逐爲一般人所特別注目了。各式各樣的貸款，各地各業不斷地在申請著；商業行莊存款的提存額，也紛紛地在議論著；五千萬以上的借款，是否必須經過四聯的核准，又紛紛地在批評著；甚至四聯本身應否繼續存在，也有人提出這根本問題。</p>
<p>四聯所以抽緊銀根，不肯放款，當然也有其正當的理由。以意度之，安定物價，避免加以刺戟，當是主因之所在。回憶糧貸成立之初，不上二三日，各地米價便發生了絕大的衝動。那麼，他們這種謹慎的態度，也可說持之有故。</p>
<p>不過現在髙利貸的存是事實，一般工商業都感到轉周的困難也是事實，許多工廠和商店紛紛地倒了，更是事實。據說，現在日本的利牽不過二薇，台灣也不過六　，那麼，本埠一角半甚至二角左右的拆息，在要和人家竸爭的工商業界看來，是否過髙，應否改善，實在用不著再加以討論，難道那些主持四聯的大人先生，和金融巨頭，都不曾想到嗎？</p>
<p>物價髙漲的主要原因有二：　爲通貨膨脹，　爲供給不夠。這是最明顯的事實。因爲抽緊銀根的結果，許多生產事產已經支持不住了；以後物資的供應必然地將昌漸減少。這種情形，是否爲間接地抬髙物價？這問題，實不容加以忽視！</p>
<p>而且物價的漲風，似乎並不因銀根的收緊而中止，而回落。這幾日來，黃金，美鈔，紗，布，米，麥，麵粉，食油，呢絨，人造絲等主要商品，不是又在竸走飛躍嗎？一方面漲風依舊，抽緊銀根並不發生絲毫阻遏的作用，一方面卻反逼倒了工商業，間接地促進了漲風。我們認爲這種作風，確實已到了應該「知過必改」的階段，慎勿硬著頭皮錯到底，使中國的工商業歸於盡。</p>

<h3>紐約前鋒論壇報著論　駁斥周恩來聲明　謂其目的純係宣傳作用</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿二日電〕紐約前鋒論壇報，昨駁斥周恩來所稱美國之政策正破壞中國經濟之聲明，該報評周氏之言，純爲宣傳作用，且企圖損害美國之聲望。該報之社論題稱：「周君之宣傳」，全文如下：最近中國最荒謬之一次聲明，即爲周恩來之聲明，渠稱，美國之政策正破壞中國之經濟，此身爲共黨官員之周君發之言，顯然純爲宣傳作用者，其目的顯在於其所能破壞美國之聲望，若周君城能關切中國經濟情形錯誤之興象，則渠自能毫無困難，列舉其真實之原因，蓋渠正如其他一般人士，而已明察，其原因毫無神秘處，第一原因，且亦爲最重要之原因，即爲中國政府已在職時喪失其一切最佳之收入來源，故不得不賴發行鈔票以生存，此舉已造成可怕之通貨膨脹．第二原因，即爲國共之衝突，延緩經濟之復員，其中一部分，係共軍有效切斷交通綫所致。第三原因，即爲政府中不少無效率或貪污（或兩者兼之）之官員。第四即爲蘇聯在東北破壞或移走地之工業設備，周君反以此歸咎美國，其所持之理由，爲若干美國剩餘物資交予中國政府後，即流入黑市，此言果屬不謬，然此事除在上海及多數各城外，其他各地並不重要，若稱中國之受苦，乃由於美國以其海陸軍所不再運用之物資售與中國所致，則此言可充分顯示其不合理及無頭腦也。</p>

<h3>瑞士對蘇復交　重申外交政策</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社沮利希二十二日電〕瑞士外長貝蒂比爾頃向婦女大會第三屆會議發表演說，對于蘇聯外交使節行抵瑞士一事，有所論列。其言略謂，瑞蘇兩國恢復邦交，并非爲最高點，而爲兩國間永久友誼之開端。吾人對于民主以及個人與國家之關係，所抱觀念固有不同，但吾人均欲獲悉蘇聯人民之生活方式。以言瑞士與美國關于德財產問題所成立之協定，德國前途動盪不不定期，殆爲一般政局中焦躁不安因素之一。目下國際局勢頗爲嚴重，大國小國均互相攻擊，所用語詞均爲外交上前所未用者，但相信比項爭議終必能克服，殆無疑義。世人對于聯合國憲章，斯望甚殷，但惜其未能副世人之期望，甚至若十國家之戰爭工業照常生產，以致造成非常危險之流言即所謂第三次大戰不可避免是也。所幸吾人仍包樂觀態度，不爲憂懼惡化所襲。以言瑞士之中立地位聯合國憲章必以聯合國會員國所負之義務加諸我國，但我國處于中立地位，勢難予以履行，是以瑞士至何時始能加入聯合國機構，實無人知之，但亦有一可能性，在最短期內即可實現，女子聯合國機構之會址，或將以舊國際聯盟大日內瓦之會址充用之云。</p>

<h3>美助日復興工業經濟　日繭輪華遭拒絕　麥帥紡織顧問發表話談</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿三日電〕麥帥總部紡織顧問馬加納今日指責中國行政院長宋子文，并稱反對以任何蠶繭運往中國。按中國駐日代表團曾要求將日本蠶繭一午萬磅運至中國，遭麥帥總部拒絕，近曾表示不滿，且間接指責美國資本家企圖佔有日本絲業，故引起馬氏反響。據馬加納稱：日本所付佔領軍費用，其主要來源係出于日本之絲織業故該項計劃未獲如愿。中國絲廠曾于本年初在國內購買質地惡劣之蠶繭一大批，以爲由此種蠶繭制成之絲，可在美國或國際市場高價出售。中國方企圖以低價擭較優之日本蠶繭，用以將其前在本國購買蠶繭時所費之款爲之扯抵。日本正需其所有蠶繭，維持生絲出口，一部份日本絲廠現被催促改製棉織及人造絲織物，亦即爲此。刻已命令日人擴大桑田，籍以增加蠶繭數額，使每年生絲出口可達三千萬磅，戰前日本，每年輪出生絲曾達九千五百萬磅。中國現有蠶汞每年可製生絲二萬包，但此點中國尚未作到。中國代表團要求日本蠶汞運華，係出諸中國蠶絲公司直接向該代表團請求。美國商人從未假政府之手，要求麥帥總部爲之獲得日本出口商品。任何運華蠶繭均將使日本經濟愈愛虧損，故如以日蠶繭運華，將屬違反波茨坦宣言，與佔領日本之目的自不相符云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日民〕美政府援助日本恢復工業經濟，正在穩健進行。此事係國務院，陸軍部及其他政府機關合作，務使日本儘速恢復其經濟地位，至少足以自經，并籍專家援助，以支付聯合國之佔領軍費。日本紡織業，棉紗業及人造絲業，均獲得有力援助。美政府則收買日本所能生產之全部生絲，并將以更多援助，給予其人造畢業，使之復興，數月以來，復不斷以原棉輸入日本，并供給款項，俾購買日本所亟需之外國貨。惟日本重復加入棉織物出口市場，并未爲聯合國所一致贊同。遠東方面，印度需要棉織品，日紗廠亦願予以供應，惟中英兩國及其他生產者，均希望恢復其戰前營業。據美國當局見解，此事雖遭各方反對，仍將繼續與日本紡織業以大規模援助。</p>
<p>日本棉布　產力估計</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕日本佔領區內美軍政府最近報告書中宣布：日本紡織界，日本銀行與大藏省三方面，已成立協定，設立銀行團，資助棉織業之活動。戰前日本在世界市場上銷售之棉布，每年達三百萬碼以上。預料本年底以前，日本將恢復出口，其中大部份爲棉織品，生絲及美國棉花紡成之棉紗。美政府機關物品信用貸款公司本年度將供給日本棉花八十九萬包，其中一八五，三八四包已運到，此種棉花均將織成棉布，以供出口。日本紡錘因戰事影響百分之八十被毀，棉布出產因之大減，但預料至一九四七年底，生產能力可以加倍。棉紗之出產，因煤斤及化學品之缺乏而受限制，但紗漿之出產已大見增加。本年度生絲出產，大約爲一億五千萬碼，但僅有三千萬碼準備出口，日絲業出口商預料；五年之內，日本生絲出口。可恢復其世界市場之領導地位。聞美，英，蘇，三國因不同之理由，均願鼓勵日本出口紡織業之復興。美國方面希望日本以出口紡織品償付進口糧食與佔領費；英國則需要日本以棉織品供給英國各屬地；蘇聯則希望在物物交換制度下獲得日本紡織品，日本紡織業因此有欣欣向榮之象。</p>
<p>直接貿易　現難邀准</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿三日電〕麥帥總部國外貿易處經濟科學組組長皮開萊談稱：日本貿易促進會近致函貿易局，主張改變日本進出口貿易程序，由製造廠家與遠東各國實行物物交換，恐未能獲得麥帥批准。日本觀察團赴國外考察國際市場情形一事，恐將不獲允許，甚且不得對國際市場趜勢自由交換消息。麥帥總部現假手日本貿易局，監視日本邀出口貿易，且擬繼續監視，以期對日經濟有所裨助，并同時以各項缺少物品供給世界其他地方。據皮氏稱：日本商人常提及直接貿易，但日本自行管理國際貿易之時機，尤未成熟，總部現已人事研究，最后或將許與各國發生一部份商業關係，但爲時尚屬遙遠。總部刻已與各國實行物資交換。</p>
<h3>日上院通過法案　實施社會福利制</h3>
<p>爲日本歷史上　舉</p>
<p>〔路透社東京廿二日電〕日本上議院通過「日常生活安全法」，規定在各市設保護救濟會，以援助失業·貧病·產婦·頒分養老金，及其他各種救助工作。該一法案係由盟軍所促成，爲日本歷史上空前之舉。日本昔日根本上未曾見過社會福利制度，此一法案之通過，可表示日政府已負起社會福利之責任矣。</p>
<h3>日本曾豢白俄間諜　陰謀暗殺史達林　遠東法庭揭露軸心締盟真相</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿三廣播：在今日在審訊日本戰犯法庭中，有驚人之發現，美方提出納粹秘密文件，證明前任日本駐德大使大島曾進行暗殺史達林之陰謀而未成功。據謂當時大島曾遺派白俄間諜人員十名，越過高加索邊境，攜帶炸彈，圖謀致史達林于死地，但未成功。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿三日電〕遠東國際法庭檢察官，今日繼續提出種種證件，揭露軸心國外交之真相。一九三九年意外相齊亞諾與日駐意大使白島會談結果，首相平沼贊成德意日三國同盟，外相有田銷冷淡，白島則大爲贊成，結果附有保留條件甚多，欲將該同盟限爲對蘇同盟，大島·白島兩人拒將此項日本之訓令傳達德意，而希望日本全面接受同盟案。德駐日大使沃特六本國政府報告，謂日陸相及藏相贊成三國同盟，外海兩相則表示反對。陸軍力謀同盟之成立，如歸失敗，將退出內閣，而海軍則由海軍次官山本領導，表示反對。迨德蘇簽訂不侵犯條約后，三國同盟之交涉應行停止，又謂該項不侵犯條約達反防共協定，但大島并不將該項抗議失卻重要性后，茲將抗議書遞交德政府。一九四〇年德駐日大使斯塔瑪致本國政府報告稱：得大島，白島，寺內，</p>
<p>石井諸人竟力援助，一時后退之陸軍親德份子正圖謀復勢力。后復電稱：米內閣雖係親英美妥協，然遭陸軍及國民之反對，致其政策不能實現，本人昭見近衛，三原等人，以謀煽動日本之反美感情。現正努力使日本蘇和解，希望近衛出任首相。</p>

<h3>近代「泰山」　羚羊羣中成長健步如飛　不諳人語作羊鳴吃青草</h3>
<p>〔路透社報達廿二日電〕近在外約但沙漠中發見之羚羊人，現出伊拉克油公司之賈爾博特加意照顧中。據賈氏稱，當該一十五齡之奇人被捕獲時，曾以每小時五十哩之速率奔跑，速率較百碼之世界短跑記錄，尤离出兩倍餘。此一近代「泰山」，想係于幼時爲其母所棄，而爲一羣羚羊所收養，逐漸習得羚羊之各種特性，余曾詳細加以研究，覺其行動國，鳴聲，無一不似豢羚羊，僅願食青草，不原吃普通食物。但余確信彼乃人類，不過在豢羚羊羣中生長而已。常第一次被獵羚羊之人發見時，幾乎喪生，幸陰中一人見羊羣中有一小孩，立即招呼同伴不得開槍，乃開汽車追逐，而該孩即以每小時五十哩之速率奔跑，最后始力絕倒地。又據最初照顧該孩之魯華拉部落酉長稱，該孩在其家中之第一日，曾躍登屋頂，又自一屋頂躍至另一屋頂，后復躍入街中，最后出動車馬追捕，經兩小時餘始捕獲。當最初發見該孩時，傳說紛紜，有謂其係半人半羊者，今知該孩確係人類，僅較常人爲結實耳。渠當然不能作人語，僅能作羚羊鳴聲，據云，最近已斬習于人類生活。聞近東之遊牧民族母親往往將小孩棄于獸羣，但結果大多爲獸類所食，至于得爲獸類所撫育者，則殊不多見。</p>
<h3>中東之謎（上）</h3>
<p>— 巴鰓第原著　文豪節譯</p>
<p>在國際舞臺上，中東又要再度顯其身手了。在這里，英俄是對立著，美國是立在英國一面，而迭國也急急要走上舞臺，她最近曾做過好幾次的調人，至于中東的人民，在不久以前，他們是被買身于事外的，對於這幕戲情，簡直莫明其妙，可是現在情形不同了，人民的代表，不問是真的假的，也常常在這舞臺上估著相當的地位。中東的關鍵是握在英俄手中，英國深恐俄國在近東諸國中對于左派分子的鼓勵，會威脅大英帝國的生命綫。反之，俄國深穎英國會利用反動勢力所造成的政府，與其爲難。</p>
<p>困難在中東是到處醖醾著。其因素約可分爲三項：　英美法蘇間的利害衝突；　在過去三十年中，高度的國家主義深深抓住了伊斯蘭教；　由于在二次大戰中和西方之類頻繁接觸，造成了一種社會的覺醒，又由于俄國帶來的社會主義，使得這種覺醒更加速進行著。</p>
<p>自從文明誕生以后，地理和歷史便賜予中東以無上的戰略重要性，因爲它是許多大陸間的一個橋樑，一個橫道。它是亞洲的一部分，同時也是西方人東來的必經之道。在那里蘊藏著世界上最豐富的油礦以及其他許多尚未開發的資源。三強十分明瞭：任何一國如果單獨控制了中東，則最后必能控制亞洲及其十二萬萬人民，這差不多已佔全世界人口之一半了。</p>
<p>土耳其與海峽</p>
<p>貢國深恐俄國的影響會由韃靼尼爾海峽而入地中海，由伊朗而入波斯灣，這一種侵入，英國認爲是十分不利的，爲了抵抗這一種侵入，於是英國常常請求俄國和它同樣地尊重土耳其及伊朗領土政治之完整，在美國的護援之下，英國獲得了保守的土耳其和伊朗政府之較大信任。反之俄國也在宣傳英美是要控制整個中東之政治與經濟。俄國認爲它自己不僅被擯斥于中東油礦之外，并目爲了抵抗英國在那里所形成的軍事包圍而需要的海空根據地，也到處遭了有效期壁。在法意海軍崩潰的今日，地中海更成了不列顛湖了，蘇聯一直在要求著她對韃靼尼爾的權利。如果韃靼尼爾一旦入了俄國之手，則英國便無法阻止希臘的親俄黨奪取政權了。因此，土耳其和希臘一樣地形成了英國外交政策上一個關鍵。</p>
<p>伊朗事件</p>
<p>伊朗也橫臥在大英帝國的生命綫上，伊朗的海岸綫形成了整個波斯灣之東部。伊拉克，庫瓦特，蕯地阿拉伯則位于其北部西部諸區域。遠在一九一四年，庫瓦特便在英國保護之下成了一個獨立的教主國，同時蕯地阿拉伯國王自從握權以后，便與英國維持著友善的關係。按諸一八九二年三月所訂的獨佔協定，這些教主國，他們的君主本身，以及繼承人不得與英國以外之國家訂立協定或來往，也不得接受英國以外任何國家的使節，更不得割讓或出售任何土地與英國以外之國家。</p>
<p>因此，籍著這些條約，英國在波斯灣便充分地握著戰略的優勢。任何強權如果在伊朗南部佔了一席之地，便能干涉英國在阿拉伯海的交能綫。便能東進而敲北印之大門。俄國軍隊在今年三月二號以后開入了伊朗，英國便在聯合國安全理事會中大肆咆哮，其原因就在此。</p>

<h3>市府預算不敷數　通過二二一億元　決定開源彌補辦法　開徵市政建設捐　大會再延期　賽馬問題今日討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日上午舉行第二十一次會議，首先舉行紀念週，由潘議長公展致詞：市府預算於上星期六雖已開始討論，並已有若干決議，但對整個預算尙無總決定，故在今天議程中，首先要將預算決定，同時希望在上午會議中將與預算有關之加捐稅各案根據審查報吿討論決定，以彌補預算之不敷，如果我們僅通過預算，而不將彌補辦法決定，則通過之預算仍屬有名無實。其次本會各組審査報吿討論者僅及半數，如在今天（即昨大）展期之議程中不能討論完舉，大會或將展期一天或二天。最後，潘氏希望各參議員在此次大會中能始終貫澈不遲到不請假之精神，以免影饗開會，並爲選民負責任。據潘氏報吿大會最初幾天出席之參議員人數在一百五十人以上，而後來出席者僅有一百十人到一百廿人左右。</p>
<p>大會於上午討論市長交議稅捐案，經討論決議，取消房捐中附加保衛團服裝費及防疫經費後共計减少十八億元，併入預算收入中則收支不敷總數達二百二十一億元。開源辦法，娛樂捐仍提高至百分之五十征收，惟否決征收淸潔捐。同時通過征收公用事業附加捐（其中自來水捐不收）半年的可收入四十億元。房捐按實收房租百分之二十征收，　房東負担。下午討論市政捐由何人負担問題，情况頗爲熱烈，決議按房捐征收辦法由住戶負担。</p>
<p>大會最後通過市參議會各種委員會組織通則。各種委員會設主任委員一人，副主任委員二人，由各該委員互選，主任委員不得兼工會主任，任期三個月，於每次大會閉會後改選一次，每一參議員至少參加一會，至多參加二會，各種委員會每兩星期開會一次，必要時由主委召集臨時會議。</p>
<p>又大會因討論提案尙多，決展期至今日休會，今日議程將討論社會，敎育，工務，法規及、「賽馬」等問題，並將通過大會宣言。</p>
<p>收支不敷！如何彌補</p>
<p>討論兩焦點</p>
<p>上午大會中繼續討論本市下半年度預算，焦點集中於：（一）收支不敷數究應確定爲多少？（二）此項不敷數究應採用何種新的稅則以供彌補？</p>
<p>在確定不敷的數字以前，對於若干現有稅制以及市府收入項目有人提出了幾項問題：</p>
<p>旅客應盡納稅義務</p>
<p>吳正矱首先提出預算中所列二億餘元的旅棧捐是否合理？財政局長谷春帆立即予以解釋，他說凡是到上海的旅客同樣享受到上海的市政設施，當然也應該盡一部份的納稅義務。</p>
<p>議長則說明關於旅棧捐一項上次，臨參會中已決定徵收，故可不必再予討論，但後來金潤庠等再度提出經議長付請表決，結果僅極少數人贊成取消。</p>
<p>張學濂問市政府出售物資的收入四十億元以及各種公營事業的收入是否列人預算？孫云峰則問市府接收物資管理處接收到的物資是否亦列入預算？關於這幾點，市長即席起立答覆稱：出售物資的四十億元中百分之九十以上已在上半年內用之於公務員的生活補助　，公產方面因大部份產權牽涉　外交問題，尙待行政院指定　　理委員會來解決，至於接收的物資將來要列入敵僞產業管理處　內所以不能列爲預算。</p>
<p>撤銷房捐附加費　預算不敷增加</p>
<p>徐永祚指出上次大會中已決議取消房捐中的保衛團服裝費，但娛　損中本來亦附徵有該項服裝費，每月收入的爲四億元。如九月份起停徵，則不敷數將增加十六億元，如已收的七八月份亦須退還，則增加的不敷數將爲二十四億元。</p>
<p>對於這一個問題谷局長再度加以解釋，他說房捐中所附徵之保衛團服裝費在會計上係用「暫收款」科目分列，但娛樂捐中所附徵者則一向並不分開，均爲統收統支。如果加以取消，勢將發生困難之情形。事實上娛樂捐之爭論並不在於其中是否附徵服裝費，而是一個稅率百分比的問題，月前娛樂業方面曾經屢次請求减低，現在需要參議會決定的是：維持現在的稅率即照票價抽百分之四十呢還是恢復减少到以前的百分之三十？不過無論如何，如因减低稅率而增加的不敷數目還是要向市民頭上另行籌措，所以與其一樣要徵收，他認爲應該向那些有餘錢享受娛樂的人身上多收一些！</p>
<p>議長讀出了中央頒布的筵席娛樂捐法令，其中規定娛樂捐最多不得超過票價百分之五十，所以他說：「現在預算中所列僅爲票價百分之四十，並未超過規定，如果加以减低，將使全體市民囀遍增加負担，這是不對的！應該由有能力享受娛樂的人來負担！」嚴誇聲建議預算中罰金一項可增列三億元，但馮有眞加以反對，他認爲必須有違章才有罰金，如果規定數目太高，將來恐有藉端濫罰的情形發生。</p>
<p>不敷數二二一億　一百十票獲通過</p>
<p>枝節的討論至此已費去不少時間，議長終於決定將根本的原則即收支不數數的確定來提付表決。原先市政府所編預算不敷數爲三百三十三億元，經第九小組審核以後，應加的加，應减的减，核定收入爲五百五十一億餘元，去出七百五十四億餘元，不敷數爲二百零三億元，但因上次大會中決議取消房捐中附徵之保衛團服裝費及防疫經費共十八億元，故收入項下减少，不敷數則增爲二百廿一億元，這一個數字如果通過以後就須籌劃開源的辦法予以彌補，參議員們是否贊成？表決結果，到會一百十九人中舉手贊成的一百一十人，原則通過。</p>
<p>開源三法　徵收房捐改由房東負担　提高娛樂捐百分之五十　加徵公用事業附加捐</p>
<p>二百二十一億元的不敷數經表決確定以後，大會就討論如何開源彌補。市長交議五項辦法中除跑馬捐另案討論外，其餘房捐，市政捐，公用事業附加捐及淸潔捐四種經審查小組審査結果認爲應該採用市政捐及公用事業附加捐兩種。</p>
<p>審査經過據第三小組召集人路式導報吿是根據三種原則：（一）勿使市民有苛捐雜稅之感，（二）納稅標準依貧富爲比例，（三）徵收簡易不致有走漏的情形。硏討之下，覺得提高房捐雖比較容易爲市民接受，但與中央法令顯有牴觸，且恐影響到房租的增加，淸潔捐則有太爲苛細之感。公用事業附加捐最爲公平合理，徵收亦最容易，但數目太少，惟市政捐雖然徵收手續麻煩，但比較尙合公平之道，所以最初決定採用市政捐辦法，但通過以後小組會中有人提出複議，複議結果，雖仍維持原來決定，但贊成與反對之票數僅相差一票。後來有私人方面建議提出市政府建設捐的名稱，內容包括公用事業附加捐的四十億元，尙餘一百八十億餘元不敷數則依照現定的房捐比率由財政局酌最稅率徵收。</p>
<p>路氏報吿畢各參議員紛紛發表意見，討論非常激烈，重要的論點如下：</p>
<p>（一）公用事業附加捐中，有人認爲水捐不應徵收，因用水爲任何平民所必需。有人則認爲徵收電捐應　到工業界的情形，因工廠用電最多，尤以紗廠爲甚，取費亦較高，所以如欲培植工業，電捐之徵收尙應考慮。</p>
<p>名不正言不順</p>
<p>（二）最重要的是對於市政捐名稱的反對。童行白認爲市政捐實際上即是財產稅，按照房產價値徵收，合乎三民主義節制資本的政策，不過市政捐的名稱太糢糊，主張改爲房產稅，他說：「希望此後的捐稅集中在地產與房產上，不必枝枝節節的向平民頭上刮！」但議長指出市政捐的徵收對象是住戶，並非業主，故如要徵收財產稅，那是另外一件事，不能與市政捐併在一起，王劍鍔則提出從前工部局時代房捐就叫市政捐，現在有了房捐，如果再收市政捐，將予市民以不良印象他主張改稱爲市政建設捐。繼起發言的人很多，大多認爲房產稅的名稱旣名不符實，且有引起增加房租的可能，還是用市政建捐爲妥。</p>
<p>（三）陳公達另外提出一種開源的辦法，他認爲娛樂捐旣然法令規定最高可爲　分之五十，現所列僅百分之四十，可以再增加百分之十，如此則從十月份起至十二月底三個月中可增加稅收八億至十億元。</p>
<p>（四）徐永祚提出房捐中旣已剔除保衛團服裝費及防疫經費而减低徵收，其負担方式應予改善，應依中央法令按照實際租金額徵抽百分之三十，由房東負担。</p>
<p>通過三項　重要決議</p>
<p>經過幾十分鐘的討論，將各種意見歸納起來提付表決，最後通過三項重要決議：第一，娛樂捐稅率提高爲百分之五十。第二，房捐改按實際租金額徵收百分之二十，由房東負担，第三，加徵公用事業附加捐，尙不數之數，用市政建設捐名義由市府斟酌稅率徵收彌補。</p>
<p>最後，討論到市政建設捐的徵收辦法，究竟應該由房東負担？還是由房客負担？還是房東房客共同負担？</p>
<p>意見顯然也分成三派：一派認爲應由房東多多負担，他們的論點是房東旣然有房產，當然是有錢階級，有錢的應該多納些稅！一派認爲市政建設捐顧名思義是市政建設，根據權利養務平等原則，應由享受利益的人負担，現在房捐旣已決議由房東負担，市政建設捐就應由房客負担。介於這兩派中間的折中派則主張定出一個比例來由房東房客公平負担。</p>
<p>論爭紛紛，會議延長至十二時三刻尙無結果，最後由奚玉書建議留待下午提出具體數字研究後再行決定。</p>
<h3>出席大會人員發言　對外不負任何責任　撥用寺廟一點有所聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自參議會於日前通過民字第三號審査報吿決議「撥用或借用寺廟或公共建築物」爲區公所辦公之用一案後，該會日來收到各寺廟及佛敎會等請願案等甚多。</p>
<p>昨日下午潘議長在大會上特鄭重聲明兩點：</p>
<p>（一）依照本會組織條例第十八條規定，會議時不論出席及列席人員發言對本會負責對外不負任何責任。</p>
<p>（二）關於本會民字第三號審査報吿決議撥用或借用寺廟或公共建築物爲區公所辦公之用，所謂撥用當時即繩愼重考慮，凡寺廟屬於地方公有或公共管理者，及現已荒廢者，自可撥用，至一般寺廟應先商得其同意，然後借用，一面維護寺廟之產權，一面使區公所辦公處所得以解決一切撥用或借用之手續，應依法律之規定自無疑義。</p>
<h3>市民檢舉寺僧附逆　大會允轉法院辦理　撥用寺廟一點有所聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市商民謝錫卿。蔡鑑泉·陸中厚·周銀泉·證人陳志新·姚紹秀·徐宏翰，茲曾聯合檢舉靜安寺方丈德悟及住持僧密迦通敵附逆罪，並在高檢處控吿在案，雖經開庭似偵訊二次，但被告均經交你釋放，迄今時逾二月，尙無起訴消息。昨日該　　　　秀又持被吿人所辦佛敎同明學校招脾等證據（見圖）赴參議會要求主持正義，提請公決。常由龔參議員復予以接見，並向大會報吿，略謂：市民多人對靜安寺寺僧德悟密迦等列舉三大罪行，其最顯著一點，即創辦同明日語學校之奴化敎育，曾向高檢處檢舉控訴，雖開庭審訊，但要犯仍逍遙法外，故響應參義會之限期檢舉漢奸，特來陳訴云云。後經大會決定，對於此案允轉請法院辦理。</p>
<h3>討論市政建設捐　決議由住戶負担</h3>
<p>昨日下午，市參議會繼續討論市政建設捐負擔問題，對於究應由房客負擔，還是房東房客共同負擔一點，各位參議員展開空前熱烈的辯論，並且多以實際的數目字爲根據。</p>
<p>最後通過的決議案爲：「（一）市政建設捐，應依父字第二號提案之　法征收，其總額之中，除房捐按實收房租征收百分之二十，應由房主負擔外，餘數即規定爲設捐捐率，是依房屋現値分爲三等甲等現値一億元或以上者收月捐千分之三。乙等現値在五千萬元或以上，而不及一億元者，收月捐千分之二。丙等現値在五千萬元以下者，收月捐千分之一。</p>
<p>徐永祚報吿　房東不堪負担</p>
<p>根據上面的捐率，徐永祚有一個數目字的報吿。他以二十六年度的房租爲標準，分爲甲乙丙三等。說明市政建設捐倘由房東負擔的話，房東將賠累不堪。假設甲等房屋，二十六年度月租五百元，以法定一百六十倍算，現在租金八萬元，除去應繳的百分之二十房捐計一萬六千元，凈收六萬四千元。這類房子在二十六年時的値五萬元，以五千倍計，現値二億五千萬元，征千分之三市政建設捐爲七十五萬元，除凈收之六萬四千元房租外，要賠六十八萬六千元，就是與房客各負擔一牛，也還要賠三十一萬一千元。乙等房屋，假定戰前租一百元，現租一萬六千元，除三千二百元房捐，凈收一萬二千八百元。現値五千萬元，需繳市政建設捐千分之二，計十萬元，要賠八萬七千二百元，房東房客平均負擔，房東也要賠二萬七千二百元。丙等房屋假定戰前租二十元，現在法定租金爲三千二百元，除去房捐六百四十元，淨收二千五百六十元。現値約一千萬元，應繳市政建設捐一萬元，要賠七千四百四十元，房東房客平均負擔，房東也要賠二千四百四十元。最後徐永祚問：「這種辦法是否合理，是否辦得到？結果房東只得將房屋放棄，因爲有了房子不僅無錢可賺，還要賠錢，誰還要房子？在房荒如此嚴重之秋，事實上也不可能。而且，市政建設捐倘由房東付，成爲了財產稅，是不合理的。顧名思義，理應山享受市政建設的人付」。</p>
<p>潘議長論　徵收辦法</p>
<p>潘議長發現了一件很奇怪的事，他說：「目前房屋估値很困難，而且財政局的估價人可操高下之權，難免不生流弊。市政建捐相率按房屋現値征收，徐參議員永祚已有數目字的說明，本席也的略算過，不過本席所算得的結果，較徐參議員約　高，計丙等房屋應繳市政建設捐一萬二千元，乙等應繳十二萬元，甲等應繳八十萬元。但有一件事很奇怪，倘照交字第二號辦法，繳納房捐，市府在半年內中可收一百八十億元，足以彌補預算之不足。而房客的負擔却减少了。本席不知道財政局怎樣估法的，但這個辦法對一般人民是有利的。房捐照實收房租征百分之二十，我們已決定了。現在我們可以採交字第二號的辦法，但不是房捐，而是市政建設捐。根據交字第二號辦法，本年秋季，甲等房屋房捐比夏季加三倍，乙等比夏季加二倍，丙等比夏季加一倍。到了冬季再加一借。所謂夏季房捐征收辦法，是照二十六年度房租的五百六十倍，征百分之十四。這就是說丙等房子，二十六年度租二十元，夏季房捐爲一五一二元，秋季爲三〇二四元，冬季爲六〇四八元。秋冬二季，平均不過四千五百多元，而且還可以除去房東所繳納之實收房租百分二十之房捐。但照房屋現値征千分之一，就是和房東平均負擔，房客也要付市政建設捐五千元。所以照這種辦法，房客是便宜的了。照這個辦法，乙等房屋，戰前租一百元的，秋季繳二萬二千六百八十元，冬季繳四萬五千三百六十元。但照市政建設捐捐率，房客負擔一半的話也得繳五萬元。甲等房屋，戰前租五百元的，秋季繳十五萬一千二首元，冬季繳三十萬零二千四百元。但照市政建設捐捐率，房客負擔一半，也得繳三十七萬五千元。所以，倘依照交字第二號的辦法征收，再從總額之中，減去房東應繳之房捐，房客可以便宜不少。這個數目，不論甲乙丙等房屋，房客所繳的錢，都比照房屋現値抽市政建設捐的一半來得少。所以本席建議採用這種辦法。」各參議員都熱烈鼔掌贊成。</p>
<p>負担問題　一塲論爭</p>
<p>關於數字上的統計報吿，谷局長和路式導也都有說明。谷局長所說明的是，房捐照實收房金征收百分之二十以後，房東的負擔輕重，看他所收的租金而定。房租收得高，房捐當然也就多了。至於路式導所說明的，是市政建設捐，由房東負擔是不合理的。</p>
<p>傳統先從理論上着一眼，他說：「我不計算數目字，但我們要追求眞理。老實說，講負擔，房東房客都負擔不起。現在所征收的是市政建設捐，誰享受市政建設，誰就得付捐，名不正則言不順，這一點，我們得弄明白。至於地主，將來要付地價稅，土地增値稅，那數目也一定自很大的。」奚玉書也就追求眞理發言，認爲眞理是在市政建設捐，應該由房客負擔。徐副議長說：「兄弟是勞動家却代表資本家說話。現在有錢的人手裏所有的，決不是房地產，而是金條，美鈔，棉紗及其他貨物。捐稅應該合理。」最後的結論也是「市政建設捐應由享受市政建設的人負擔。」</p>
<p>張志韓一度起立，大聲疾呼，請各參議員，不要對房東想得太多，而忘記了住戶，要知道，住戶也負擔不起的。王劍鍔也堅主應該顧到房客的負擔。</p>
<p>不要忘記二房東</p>
<p>對於房屋現値的估計法，李文杰金潤庠，陶百川等皆發表許多意見。馮有眞提醒大家，不要忘記房東及房客以外的第三種人：二房東。因爲對大房東，他是房客；對二房客，他又是房東，無往不利，佔盡了便宜。所以我們絕對不能放鬆二房東。</p>
<p>各參議員唇槍舌劍，爭執不休。但到了最後，潘議長起立發言，終於得到絕對多數的贊同，而將這件議案解決了。</p>

<h3>敵僑竟圖箝制言論自由　中外新聞界密切注意之一案　美記者被訴審結　雙方律師各逞雄辯庭諭廿七宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院於昨日下午三時續審德籍納粹嫌疑犯沈克自訴美合衆社駐滬辦事處主任侖道爾誹謗案，旁聽席坐爲之　，美籍者幾佔其半·沈克未到，由代理人姚肇第律師代表出席，侖道爾延陳霆銳律師辦護，發言時由合衆明名記者袁倫仁君任翻譯。兩造律師舌劍唇槍，激辯甚烈，至四時半，庭上宣佈辯論終結，定二十七日下午二時宣判。據陳　銳氏吿記者，法院雖定期宣判，仍不一定即爲受理本案之表示。</p>
<p>審訊於極緊張之空氣中開始。侖道爾步至被吿欄時，神態略見不安，袁倫仁立於其側，隨時將各人發言，以甚輕微之語聲傳譯。姚律師首向庭上聲明，沈克因覊押美軍事法庭看守所，故不能出席。庭上遂諭可由姚律飾代表。</p>
<p>就國際公法論　沈克無起訴權</p>
<p>陳霆銳律師遂起立，以緩慢而有力之語氣爲侖辯護。略謂）依法凡不提自訴而自訴之案件，法院應不予受理。至沈克之不得提起自之訴，則可以國際公法及中華民國的法爲根據。以國際公法規定言，沈克爲德籍，且係著名納粹份子，列名於我國遣送回德之名單，且以有戰犯行爲，故至今尙在美軍法庭覊押之中。目前中德尙未媾和，法律上尙處於交戰狀態，故自訴人之身份爲敵僑。敵僑有無起訴之權，在我國並無明文規定，然國際公法爲國際間共同承認之法律，故國際公法應可視爲各國法律中之一部份。按照國際公法在第一次世界大戰後之規定，對敵僑之起訴權有相對的權利之承認。英美二國，承認敵僑有起訴權，惟有一先決條件，即該敵僑必須繼續居住於所在國，且爲安分守己之良民，得爲常地政府容許居住者。而沈克固未得我國政府允許繼續居住中國，外交部駐滬辦事處曾來函證明，「沈克爲在遣送德僑回國名單之一人，因有戰犯罪嫌，業被覊押。」陳氏即將該函呈案，並續稱，由此可證沈克決非政府所歡迎或容許留居我國者，况沈克非但爲納粹黨員，且爲納粹中之間諜乎！故曰，就國際公法論之，沈克無起訴之權。</p>
<p>根據約法　請勿受理</p>
<p>次就我國之約法言，根據約法第二章第十五條，人民有發表言論及刊行著作之自由。我國政府亦早一再揭　言論自由爲政綱。被吿身任美國合衆社駐華辦事處處長，以其新聞記者之身份，其言論目由自更應受法律之嚴密保護，出版法第十九條第七條即有規定。記者報導新聞，向抱有聞必錄之旨，而今自訴人乃圖以納粹敵僑之身份，箝制友邦人士之自由，而向鈞院起訴，實爲喪心病狂！須知納粹之法律，固可禁止人民之言論自由，而納粹之法律，絕不能適用於民主之中國！本案不特與友邦在華之記者及出版人有關係，即於本國之記渚及出版人，關係亦極重大，應詛鈞院不予接受。</p>
<p>陳氏繼引國際公法權威奧本海之著作，略謂敵僑旣不能提訴訟，亦無出庭弁護之權。又引諾愛士之言，略謂對外僑之保護，應以安分守己及繼續居住者爲限。並言本案已引起國際間之注意。本市英文大美晚報曾刋一紐約來電，謂本案判決果結，對外國記者在中國有無言論自由之機會，影響甚大，中國政府當局爲維護言論自由起見，本案決不應受理云云。據云，今代表被吿，根據國際公法，根據的法，請庭上諭知不受理處分。</p>
<p>自訴代理人表示　無論戰勝戰敗　私權應受保護</p>
<p>沈克之代理人姚肇第律師即起而答辯稱：被吿律師之辯護，係根據國際公法及的法二點。茲先就的法方面加以答辯，的法誠規定言論自由，但此項自由，應有相當限制，否則刑法上妨害名譽之一章竟可廢止。故所謂自由者，應爲在法律範圍內之自由。被告是否超越的法所定之言論自由，仍請庭上調査後予以有罪或無罪之判決。再就國際公法言，在封建時代，戰事發生，戰敗者捨爲奴隷外別無他途。然應知此種觀念，爲封建時代之觀念。被吿律師所呈各書，本席未經寓目，是否斷章取義，亦不能言，然充其量僅爲一家之言，不足爲據。無論戰勝戰敗，人民之私種應受保護。一九〇七年各國曾在海牙簽訂國際公約，中美德等國皆簽字其上，其中第四章第二十三條第八項，曾明文規定，特別禁止消滅戰敗國人民起訴等權。蓋人不能離其權利而生存，不能不受法律之保護。試舉一例，强姦案件係吿訴乃論者，如被害人爲德僑，而不許其吿訴，則本案且將不能成立！</p>
<p>被吿之行爲實已超過記者應遵守之範圍，其所發消息來源不明，而誇張實多，其行爲已妨害我國之公共秩序。本案發生後，侖道爾竟向美國國務院申訴，其意實欲藉其本國之政治力量，挾制我國政府！務請庭上體察案情，顧全事實，平心靜氣，就案論案。</p>
<p>沈克之被遣回國，乃「一般性」之撒僑。被遣送者不一定即爲不良份子，蓋我國政府惟恐彼等滯華後無法維持生活，故令彼等回國，故被吿律師所云被遣送者即爲敗類之一點，實不足採·沈克現雖已被提起公訴，但尙未判決，而美軍法庭所起訴之罪行，僅爲刺探軍情，而實毫無事實根據，彼等實欲羅織周內，故意造成大獄而已！</p>
<p>是時，陳律師憤然起稱，本案之起訴即不合法，被吿方面不願循此不合法之途徑，而論本案之實體。</p>
<p>所謂證件有三</p>
<p>然姚律師雖經此打擊，仍繼續其陳述，謂被吿不能證明其所誹謗之事實爲眞實可靠，而起訴人方面，及可證明侖道爾之語爲絕非事實。證件有三：（一）陳介大使有函證明沈克之行爲向係有利於中國。（二）沈克係於一九四一年七月十一日離渝，經河內而至上海，有護照上各加簽可以證明。其離渝之時，中國尙未與德宣戰，今侖道爾乃謂其去渝即係破壞我國之地下工作，顯係響　虛構。（三）沈克回滬之後，且與我國地下工作之重要負責人常有往還。吳紹澍有函證明云，彼與沈克因組織部負責人之介紹，時常見面，且稱沈克爲中國之忠實友人，在渝時即常在報道中盛譽我國之抗戰，並曾揭露德國有親日之傾向。吳氏證函並稱，余等「常常見面，但並無互相利用，交換情報之事」。且謂「余對沈克，始終信任不疑，故時與相見」，後並聲明「余與沈克相識，及以後發生之關係，均曾呈報組織部在案」。可見侖道爾之所書，純屬子虛。</p>
<p>陳律師乃重起答辯，除重申沈克之自訴即不合法外，並稱：納粹之心目中，早無國際公法及條的存在。自訴代理人　奧本海之著作爲「一家之言」，然自訴代理人對國際公法之硏究，無論如何高明，當亦未必及此權威也，海牙公約之拘束程度，學說不一，是否適用，應由各國政府自定，即以英德二國論，即早表不予承認。條約之拘束應取互惠待遇，德國本身即早已中止應用，今乃又欲求此公的保護乎？</p>
<p>何以不到　何幫羈押</p>
<p>至謂被吿企圖用政治力量挾制中國，更屬笑談！事關中美德三國間之國際問題，被吿觀諸本國政府，亦不爲過，根本未有利用政治力量之企圖！自訴人應知問心有愧，因彼實欲利用中國法院判決之力量，企圖推翻美軍法庭證據確鑿之判　而已</p>
<p>自訴代理人　　遣送之敵僑不一定即爲壞蛋。亦爲缺乏常　中國政府遣送敵僑、　無一定之標準，外交部所遺送者，爲納粹分子，爲間諜，爲流氓之類，如被留中國之二千德僑今日在此起訴，本律師並不反對。又試間中德交戰時，在德華僑有起訴德否？如能證明確有起訴之權，始足以談互惠。况此訊之發表，初不限於合衆社。聯合社有之，申報·新聞報亦有之，蓋新聞之來源，實係美軍總部之記者招待會也。最後尙有一點：根據我國刑事訴訟法，自訴人經傳喚，無正當之理由面不到者，應不予受理。本案自訴人已傳喚二次，何以不到？如謂係被覊押之故，然則彼果又以何故而覊押乎？能否認爲正當之理由，仍請庭上考慮。</p>
<p>侖道爾至是乃於鵠立一個半小時之後，開始發言，略謂彼完全同意其辯護人之主張，今日不欲證明沈克之是否爲間諜。其所發報道之來源爲美國軍部，自訴代理人今日似欲本人證明美軍當局之言是否確實矣。</p>
<p>四時半，庭上宣稱辯論終結，定二十七日下午二時宣判。</p>

<h3>鬧市白晝盜刦　膽敢拒捕開槍　亞西亞錢莊損失甚鉅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四川北路八百十八號亞西亞錢莊，昨日適爲開慕一週紀念，又因連日黃金美鈔激漲，故營業頗盛。詎午後一時突來身着藏靑西裝之盜匪一名，手携皮包，聲稱欲購買大條一根，當由店夥招待至內室，在看貨時，該匪即拉開皮包，抽出快慢機二枝，迫令所有人員不得聲張。是時另有五盜各執槍械跟踵入內，一盜任望風，端坐室外櫃上，僞充職員，一盜把守後門，一盜行刦，二盜看管店員，正在行刦時，適有俄人一名前來，擬將美票出售，當被望風匪徒一併驅入內室，並用英語令該俄人「坐下」。各盜刦得黃金百餘兩，現鈔八百餘萬，美鈔二千五百元，盡行裝入旅行袋內，當時聞望風之匪徒，大呼「風來了」，即忽促由前門向北逃逸。當行刦時，該莊周姓職員乘機已從後門溜出，報吿附近崗警，故匪等携贓出店時，即爲該崗警出槍射擊。匪徒竟亦還槍拒捕。卒因地處熱鬧，各匪終被兎脫。事後宣局長聞訊，以該匪等膽敢白晝搶刦，已諭令虹口警分局尅日破案。</p>

<p>緣本月十日宣局長接獲密吿，謂有販毒巨魁宋志安，住林森中路和合坊三十二號，近有鉅款託本市新華銀行匯津。此款實係購運嗎啡之用。宜氏當晚即交刑事處張處長，囑即派員調査。經張氏與第二課　課長商討後，即晚先派課員馮起山，辦事員李錫淸等赴和合坊調査。不料該處竟係空屋，且屋主朱岐山，已在旬日前亦因販毒案被地檢處拘捕時逃逸。馮等因情節可疑，即加搜索，當得朱岐山頂屋契據一紙，其所頂之屋在蟠能街十號。遂跟踪追究，至十一日午後，始獲悉朱岐山匿居地址。乃率同警士張雲明，丁兆淦，高福海，丁文江等，馳至崑山花園四號十二號房間，在套室內將朱逮捕。當塲抄出咖啡精二磅，黑色毒料半面盆，正在搜査時，忽有台灣人孫志成者，挑金條四根，計重三十九兩五錢四分擬購買嗎啡，即予扣留，並派員至其住處武昌路積善里九號內，抄出嗎啡原料三磅二兩，戤一支。其時又有一衣冠楚楚體格魁梧之河北人，隨同軍官一名前來。該軍官並携有手提箱一只，迨進室後，發見室內情形特殊，即欲返身圖逃，當爲員警攔阻。經盤訊後，一名張明遠，卅二歲，一稱係九十四軍上校軍官名嚴東甫，卅七歲，謂方自天津搭中航機來滬。待警員令其出示身份證時，則支吾其詞，遂確定冒充無疑，當將其所携手提箱打開檢査，在該箱夾底內搜出嗎啡原料三磅五兩。至此，警員除將上項人犯一併帶局外，仍派員日夜留守該處。同時虹口警分局亦接獲密吿，在寳山路頤福里五十四號，皇家飯店三百十一號等處，拘獲是案同黨台灣人李紅英，張根田，張義仁，李定國，張李秉崑（女性）等五名，詳情已誌本報。是後警局在偵査時，復得悉該案總機關設在平，津，台灣等地，重要負責人即爲宋志安，經去電天津警局協緝，於本月十五日拘獲。而本市方面亦陸續拘獲周達，馬白午，呂新泉，宋自新，等四名，抄出特製之夾底箱三只，藏嗎啡用橡皮套三十五只，以及販毒盈餘派款單，往返電報稿底等證物頗多。又在周達處搜出東北挺進軍身份證及東北挺進軍軍用證明書云。</p>

<p>外股仍在衰竭中，無法重振，證券帮人心動搖，各股除鋼業外，仍呈動搖之勢，怡紗頗有曲折，晨開八六〇〇元曾低至八〇〇〇元而後轉呈掙扎，結果較上週六計鋼業平平，會德豐業廣紙業微挫，怡紗怡啤航業跌半成，英聯跌落一成弱。</p>
<h3>結欵紛至沓來　美鈔又創高價　烚赤隨波逐流</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初平　穩，高價時頗有壓力，而多掙扎，晨開微降爲二一七萬五左右，開後浮多出籠，買方失望下，逐漸自二一七萬八起，節節盤小，十時後央行以二一六萬五之價配給三十條，此從疲莫能興，無法振作，午前曾步降至二一五萬，但午刻美鈔突又吿俏，金價急切帶高至二一七萬五左右，午後再度受美鈔爭買所激漲，升至二一九萬外，而後稍回，結果與上週六相彷彿，飾金紋銀銀元均平，暗息仍在一角三左右。</p>
<p>外幣初疲後回，美鈔晨開三七五〇元，即有了結之流，一般隔週浮多紛有了結，中途盤跌至三六四〇元，而後始有維持，午刻扒結之風又盛，再猛漲至三八〇〇元外，午後在結款及凍結外匯者，預事購貯，兩重爭買下，竟迫近三九〇〇元高價結束，結果較上週六再好一一〇元，對黃金比便軋攏至五六二元對十兩，港票初平後俏，午後更爲堅昂，一般未獲美鈔者，咸有搜羅，亦漲二十元，港匯七六〇元，印匯九二〇元左右，均少賣戶，英匯一二〇〇〇元外，美匯對做吿絕。</p>

<h3>配紗昨漲七萬　比黑市仍較低廉　紗銷略呆棉布升騰不已　紡建聯營配銷供給不多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市反動回跌，晨初喊價雖昂，然買戶稀少，價乃支持不住，實因上週五六兩日所漲已巨，客帮觀望，昨少進取，同行多頭，亦獲利出　，價遂下游，四十二支及廿支約　小四萬至十萬，十六支所跌有限，做開價格在一百五十五七萬之譜，幾與廿支紗價並價齊驅，亦近來紗業市塲中所罕見者，上午紡建期貨掛牌有紗綫八種，係採聯營配售方法，其價格至下午七時左右方宣佈（見市價欄）。</p>
<p>申請核减　配價提高</p>
<p>國民營各紗廠第二次集團配紗，自經決議總額仍定三萬件後，即由紡建分担一萬二千件，各民營廠分祖一萬八千件。昨日下午，紗廠聯合配銷委員會，舉行首次開紗。迄五時許，始決議開售二十支棉紗標準數額計民營各廠共九〇五件，照申請額减半配售。又在第一次集團配紗三萬件售完後，第二次集團配紗尙未開售前，各廠因週轉資金關係，計開售二，六四四件，今亦攤人第二次集團配紗之總額三萬件內。惟配價則仍以每件一百三十五萬元計算。此外，舫建方面，昨日共配售一，六二五件，（惟紡建公司消息，則稱配售一，五〇一件。）而申請數額，計各色棉紗在內，共達七，五六七件。昨日開售價，以四百磅二十支棉紗爲標準，每件已提增至一百四十三萬元。較上次開售價，已漲七萬元。核諸市價，配售價仍低廉約百分之七。</p>
<p>公會通吿　辦法八條</p>
<p>茲將會議決定各紗廠開售棉紗暫行辦法，摘錄如左：</p>
<p>一，凡承購棉紗之客戶，暫以各廠原有往來客戶爲限，並以實用戶申請爲優先。</p>
<p>二，上述實用客戶，有確實需要購辦棉紗者，應先向素所往來之紗廠塡其由請書，載明擬購棉紗之支別數量用途等項，客戶塡寫申請數額，須以確實需要爲限，如有投機及虛報，各該廠得酌予削减，或取消其申請資格。</p>
<p>三，各紗廠收到承購申請書審査後，根據以往購紗紀錄，參考其申請數量是否確實，如有不實，應隨時糾正，於常日上午十二時前彙送本會決定，於當日下午四時前，將本會所決定數量及標準價格，（以廿支棉紗爲標準）通知各紗廠，轉知申請人，各紗廠及申請人，對決定數量價格，不得自行增减。</p>
<p>四，各廠應售棉紗數額，如有餘額時，由本會代爲配售。</p>
<p>五，申請人於接得通知後，應即日向廠方簽訂成交　約，並限次日將應付貨款如數以現款付淸</p>
<p>六，各紗廠出售棉紗，每大包一律實重四百磅，每小包實重十磅，不得另加小支。</p>
<p>七，決定出售之棉紗，自付款日起，隔十天後，儘速陸續派淸</p>
<p>八，申請人接到決定通知後，不履行訂約或交款者，本會得取消其申請次格。</p>
<p>旺銷季節　棉布飛躍</p>
<p>昨布市仍騰躍不已，雖客銷各路俱衰，而本街之走化特旺，原以時屆旺銷季節，本街門售應銷股繁，是以採辦者踵接，而染廠方面因現貨無法購進，紡建公司之供給，自採聯營配銷方法後，無形中價格已漲起不少，但供量仍微，是以祗得掉進近期貨，以資調劑，昨日做開高擋坯子八萬元光景，元嗶嘰八萬五千元左右，元電光斜五萬元。</p>
<h3>市場賣風大盛　華股一致虛疲</h3>
<p>華股昨衰敗下墜，永紗有廣帮收羅，爲狀較定，晨開時各股以熱門較爲生色，尙在上週六午收之上，開後兩大熱永紗美亞尙有新多參加，一度見俏，無奈北帮力售美亞，永紗亦在大勢不利之下，遭受普遍性之斬多，縱有廣帮若一八四號等吸收，亦難止賣風，僅過程較美亞稍平而已，迨後美亞經一再漸多，恐慌更甚，中途竟缺乏維持，買方束手，於是整個股市都籠罩陰霾，怯疲更甚，中絲以籌碼不多，雖有回跌，極爲有限，臨收低後有空方獲利補進，略有回升，結果較前收計永紗信和絲業新亞五和均吿微跌，美亞新光景福勤興統益中紡大通榮豐火柴麗安跌半成光景，華豐獨跌一成半，水泥跌一成弱，成交總額計六、〇一四、四〇〇股，內永紗佔三、〇九〇、〇〇〇股，美亞二八〇、〇〇〇股，景福八十餘萬股，新光勤興三五十萬股，其餘均零星交易，塲外各股亦再低半成左右。</p>
<h3>秈米回跌粳米堅定　雜糧油豆漲多跌少</h3>
<p>米市昨因天已放晴，秈米來源蟬聯，消化轉淡，各種秈米均回小一二千元，白元下降二三千元，惟新粳陳粳出貨稀少，仍局立定之狀，計南北市客貨登記一萬一千餘石，麵粉昨日無市，麩皮亦無成交，黃豆到銷兩旺，汕頭泉州納胃頗暢，盤漲二千元，小麥閩方進取甚濃，價格步砌，再加千元，生仁南洋本街均有納胃，求過於供，續見飛騰六七千元，紅糧貨稀亦昂千元，菉豆高定次呆，蠶豆升千元，油市漲跌互有，生油貨多，再低千餘元，豆油挺秀，菜油微升，豆餅回漲三四百元。</p>
<h3>海關負責人談　倉庫已淸現竣事　海上偷竊情事已能控制</h3>
<p>頃據江海關負責人談：海關接收之碼頭倉庫百餘處，業已將接收之敵僞物資淸理竣事，並發還原主現僅市中心區尙有數區，正待淸理，本月底亦可發還，目前進出口以交通關係，尙未展開，各倉庫貨物極少，均感生意淸淡。</p>
<p>關於偷竊事件，海關極力設法防止，正在加强防衛力量，將恢復海上緝私船隻，一俟請准配撥後，即行成立緝私隊，現海上之偷竊，已能控制，至碼頭倉庫等處之偸竊事件，則非權力所及云。</p>
<h3>商業銀行　分組辦貸欵　一組已成立</h3>
<p>中央銀行所舉辦之工廠及出口商貸款，因不限於錢莊業，各商業銀行亦可同樣組織工商貸款銀團，向該行辦理轉抵押，頃悉：銀行業已依照該行辦法分別組織，第一組業已正式成立，計有光華，謙泰，光中，惇敍，民孚，大來，巴川，華懋，永泰，國孚等十家銀行參加，貸款合的已送中央銀行，日內即可簽訂，又川帮川鹽，川康，重慶，美豐，聚興誠等十七家銀行，及女子，永享，煤業等七家銀行，亦分別籌組中，第二第三兩組銀團，即可正式成立。</p>
<h3>驚人的搬運費　向無規定數目</h3>
<p>頃據運輸業稱：最近關於各碼頭貨物之搬運費，其取費之鉅，實堪驚人，日前有沙利文公司曾由美運到麵粉一萬二千袋，從船艙搬運至倉庫，共需費六百廿五萬元，而該項費用，各輪船公司亦向無規定數目必須先行付淸，始可提貨，又貨主於十日以內，向倉庫出貨時，每袋又須納費三百兀，茲僅以麵粉一萬二千包計算，從船艙提貨至倉庫，由倉庫出貨止，其外費已超過一千萬元以上。</p>
<h3>白煤漲勢再厲</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊承前趨勢，市價再猛升，白煤小子亦步其後塵，白煤屑尙平，烟煤僅篩揀塊因燃料管理委員會配售，浦西麥根路棧之開平火車原篩塊，品質軟次，市價略見帶升。</p>
<h3>新舊所得稅比較硏究</h3>
<p>— 徐日淸</p>
<p>（三）綜合所得稅開征</p>
<p>我國過去所行分類所得稅，係以收益爲課徵對象，如企業之利潤，存款之利息，房屋之租金等收益，課以所得，故可稱爲收益稅，未能符合能力負擔公平之原則，綜合所得稅，係對全體所得課稅，故又名一般所得稅，而以納稅個人所得爲計算單位，故亦名從名稅，即對各納稅人所有之各種所得，合計爲總所得，再從總所得中减除各項費用，以其爲課稅標準，例如法國實行綜合所得稅，規定凡在法國境內之人民，每年所得在七千法郞以上者，皆應納此稅。</p>
<p>在新所得稅法中第三條規定，個人所得，除依照前條征課分類所得稅外，其所得總額超過六十萬元者，應加征綜合所得稅，其計算方法，合併個人全年各種所得，爲所得總額，但得减除左列各項，一，共同生活之家屬，或必須扶養之親屬，每人十萬元，二，家屬中有中等以上，學校學生每人五萬元，三，已納之各類所得稅，及土地稅，（同法第十九條）其申報方法，係由義人於每年五月一日以前，將其前一年所得種類及數額，報吿主管征收機關，主管征收機關與區鄉鎭公所，或中心小學，設立聯合申報會審査（同法第二十六·條），以免虛報不報之弊。</p>
<p>吾國過去藉口戶口不嚴密，統計不完整，未曾施行粽合所得稅，此次毅然決議實行，未嘗無相當理由，此後征收綜合所得稅困難重重，勢所必至，語云；人力勝天，想必有克復之日。</p>
<p>値此綜合所得稅創辦伊始，社會人士與輿論界均感有重複之嫌，按其實際，分類所得稅係對收益課稅，綜合所得稅係對人課稅，決無重複之病，因其對象不同也，綜合所得稅最八能力負担原則，同時進步稅制，必採累進稅率，吾國分類所得稅，限於環境，與條件不够，未能發揮其效能，使多者多出，少者少出，以證券存款所得一項而言，一萬元與一萬萬元存款所得，均抽10％，實不合理，故政府採綜合所得稅，補其不足，以防財富趨於集中，立法原意實屬完美，實施能否順利，尙待主其事者之努力；再考諸先進各國，先課分類所課，再課綜合所得稅者，計有法英意等國，又各國綜合所得稅之稅率，均較吾國爲高，如美國最低抽百分之十三，英國爲百分之十，日本爲百分之十，美國最高抽百分之七二’英國爲百分之四五，日本　百分之六十，而吾國最低（即超過六十萬元者）抽百分之五，最高亦不過百分之五十。</p>
<p>（四）一個大前提——經濟穩定</p>
<p>此次新所得稅法公佈，內容上都已參酌實際情形，客觀需要，已漸趨合理化之途，實可樂觀，惟新所得稅法公佈迄今，僅四閱月之久，因幣値日貶，物價步漲，一切條文似均失其時效，獨以新所得稅法中綜合所得稅起征點一項而言，已屬過低，據悉此項起征點，當時係根據戰前上海生活調査所得資料，與卅四年九月零售物價上漲二二二〇倍計算結果，現上海市物價，根據中央銀行經濟硏究處編製上海　要商品　售物價指數，本年六月份已漲三千七百多倍，現時過三月，加以外匯調整，物價均已上漲，據估計的四千倍，或一萬倍不等，相形之下，均患時過境遷之病，其餘各項規定，如薪給報酬所得稅之免稅點等，亦莫不皆然，故一切良法美意總須在一天前提下——經濟穩定，始克有濟。（完）</p>

<h3>蘇北行（六）　泰縣東戰塲血影</h3>
<p>— 特派員杭舟</p>
<p>本報十日泰縣訊</p>
<p>蘇北有兩道長堤，這是爲人們所熱知的：左邊的是運河堤，右邊的是范公　，　堤之間爲一大片湖沼地區。以往人們每年要恐懼洪水冲倒了運河堤，使這一地區變成澤國；自從共產黨的軍隊來到蘇北以後，人們對洪水的恐懼已經被轉移了。——有太多的例子可以佐證，共軍所到之處，那兒便變成了「血海」。——「血海」是比「洪水」更可怖的名詞啊！</p>
<p>蘇北的地形限制了軍事活動，因此戰事不在運河堤上便在范公堤畔進行·當八月下旬邵伯大戰熱烈進行之際，共軍在右翼來了下突擊，如臯·海安·曲塘·黃橋等地，都又一次地展開了戰事，返鄕不久的人民又一次地走上了洗亡之逾。</p>
<p>於是，戰事的重心迅速地移到了右邊。共軍的攻勢顯然不僅在呼應左邊，並有進一步奪取兩泰，威脅江南的企圖。一個多月前，共軍作過如此的嘗試而慘敗了，現在它又重整旗鼔，　軍當然非予以再度的粉碎不可。</p>
<p>第二階段戰局　第二節目</p>
<p>右翼局面危險，共軍勢甚猖獗。　海安爲例，共軍用十二個團包圍僅及五分之一的國軍，但打了一個多星期，共軍不能動海安的一絲一毫。曲塘與大小白米則已入共軍之手。黃橋情况一度不明，現在還在附近打着。由如皋向西北至白米，向西南至黃橋的袋形地區內，流動的共軍更不在少數。泰縣和泰興外圍大小戰事不斷地進行着。</p>
<p>右翼「熱鬧」，左翼顯得沉寂。九月六日，記者在揚州搭上了行駛於揚泰路的一輛「野鷄」車，看一看這蘇北第二階段戰事的第二個節目。</p>
<p>揚泰路在目前的蘇北是一條大動脈，國軍化了不少心血把它打通而維持着。公路兩旁多的是堡壘。這些堡壘前面都染過血跡，現在雖然已看不見了，但因爲有了那些血跡而換來正在收割着豐熟的稻子的農民們的笑靨，我都一一看到了。今年蘇北是個大熟年。「靠天吃飯」的中國農民們原都應該感謝一番上帝，可是在高郵，在寶應……在那些所謂「解放區」，還有多少農民對着他們的收成在流眼淚呢！</p>
<p>朝氣普遍蓬勃　說幹就幹</p>
<p>經過一道道檢査，我到了泰縣。這是記者第二次赴泰。揚州好比半老徐娘，但泰縣就年靑得多。我感覺到的是普遍地有朝氣。丁作彬縣長是軍校十六期生，當過遊擊隊司令，一位十足的軍人。他手下的區長·鄕鎭長·自衛隊長·以至縣政府裏的秘書·科長·都和軍校與打遊擊有過關係，同過患難，現在亦正面對着患難。平日裏嘻嘻哈哈，幹起來眞有精神，挺迅速。蘇北的國軍控制的縣份中，能够和軍事配合的要稱泰縣了。修馬路，築工事，說幹就幹。工作彬在縣政府辦公室裏不能悶坐三天，他喜歡跑，到處去看。有些事須得轉轉四五道公事，擱他十天八天的，他自己下鄕，一句話就解決。</p>
<p>現在的軍人不完全是老粗，有些政治修養挺到家。工作彬有着北方人爽直熱誠的性格。泰縣的老百姓驕傲有這樣一位縣長。他說他不懂得做官，只懂得做事。他　　他的部下「沒有壞他的事</p>
<p>江南爲魚米之鄕，江北則爲鹽米之鄕，一樣的富庶，如果江南和江北有不同的情調。最顯著的或許在民性方面：江南較軟弱，江北頗强悍。强悍的民性有了組織，便是很好的地方武力。蘇北一般的感覺，地方武力不够，可是泰縣已默默地做得頗有成績。每一個鄉鎭都有了自衛隊，全縣有二千多人，一千多支槍桿，　了軍隊不少的忙。</p>
<p>這兩天，泰縣東南廿餘里，距口泰公路十八里的大泗莊受到共軍的襲擊，那兒沒有國軍駐守，自衛隊獨自抵抗着，沒有讓共軍佔到便宜。工作彬得到了報吿，親自率領了四五百名自衛隊去增援，一下子把共軍打跑了。</p>
<p>姜堰接近關綫　聽機槍聲</p>
<p>九月七日，記者隨同一〇八旅參謀長吳孝德，參謀高鴻生巡視泰縣東戰塲，工作彬亦相偕前往</p>
<p>一早出發，先到姜堰。泰姜路上，商車絕跡，軍車橫衝直撞，很快地走了卅六里路。姜堰是一個大鎭市，爲糧食集散地，往年停在這裏的運糧船，連接有三四里路長。這兒離開最前綫的馬溝，只有十里，每天晚上都可淸晰地聽到機槍聲。聽慣了，從不爲之驚擾。一家澡堂子還在大刷門面，擇吉開張，我們停留不久，便趕到馬溝去。</p>
<p>在保衛泰縣的意義上，馬溝是非常重要的據點。共軍發動攻勢以來，把泰海路截斷了。八月廿九日晚上，它糾集了二個多團乘國軍換防不久，直撲馬溝，期一舉而下，屈姜堰而脅泰縣。馬溝的守軍只有一連人，但這一連人絕不慌張，「打仗不靠人多，」他們沉着地守在工事裏，來一個打一個，來兩個打一雙。共軍把馬溝包圍了，一次次衝鋒，上來的就沒得回去。鄭亞東連長在職壕裏聽着共軍的衝鋒號，一共吹了廿次，可見那十九次衝鋒的都完了，而第廿次衝鋒的亦不能避免最後的命運，它們亦倒下了。黑夜在戰鬥中逝去，對方的槍聲寂滅。弟兄們迎着太陽發出的光芒跳出了戰壕一看：「啊！那麽多的屍體！「興奮得忘了痰倦，數一數，有三四百具。</p>
<p>我一到馬溝，鄭亞東連的弟兄搶着吿訴我這精彩的戰役。我故意掃他們的興，問道：</p>
<p>「你們死傷有多少呢？」</p>
<p>「死了一個傷了四個」。一個小兵得意地回答。</p>
<p>一比四百，或者是五比二千（共軍死傷總數），這紀鋒必使共軍咬牙不止。</p>
<p>果然，浮躁的共軍以後就每天晚上來「報仇」，但每夜都把屍體當作了禮品。</p>
<p>我們曾經立在一個堡壘上觀察地形，我問趙海雲營長：</p>
<p>「這裏距共軍前哨有多遠？」</p>
<p>「最多半里」。</p>
<p>「沒有危險嗎？」我問得十足書生氣。</p>
<p>「他們不敢——共軍是晝伏夜出的」。</p>
<p>吐出了降落傘　接濟守軍</p>
<p>回到姜堰，已是下午三時·休息了一會，我們預備回泰縣時，一架轟炸機飛臨了上空，慢慢地盤旋着，似乎尋找目標。飛機看得多了，我們毫不對它注意，突然四廂發出了驚呼聲：「丟炸彈」！人們喊着，奔着。我也吃了一驚。抬頭一望，天空中正飄着幾頂降落傘，搖搖擺擺地下降。「不像炸彈」，我直覺地想：「炸彈不該丟在這裏」。但不是炸彈，亦不該丟在這裏，我又想：「一定是飛機看錯了地方」。</p>
<p>降落傘落下的東西沒有爆炸。「飛機大槪把姜堰當做海安了。海安被困的守軍正需要物品的接濟」。我進一步想。</p>
<p>海而，飛機並不發覺錯誤，它接連地如吐蓮花似地吐出了一個個降落傘。鄕民們沒有見過這玩意兒，紛紛奔向田問去搜尋。三二四團武之棻團長命令把所有投下的東西集中到團部聽候處置。</p>
<p>薄暮時分，圍到泰縣。旅都跟空軍方面連絡，證明那批東西是接濟海安守軍的。</p>
<p>海安之圍雖尙未完全解除，其他各地的共軍雖仍在到處騷擾，但經過國軍的重新部署後，蘇北有翼的危險時期已經過去了。蘇北的軍隊和人民都有着信念。「新四軍從那裏來，把它打圓那喪去！」一個野孩子改編着歌曲唱着。中秋節到了！「月免圓圓照九洲，幾家歡樂幾家愁？」泰縣的吃食店，二天前已開始　　，準備暢渡這詩情畫意的佳節，但流亡人有家歸不得，悵對明月，不知增添了幾許新愁！</p>

<h3>無錫針織業之呼籲</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我錫邑工業，素稱發達，有「小上海」之親。針織工業在錫，過去亦曾有輝煌歷史，但自勝利後，因外受洋貨傾銷，營業一蹶不振，尤因缺乏流動資金，不得不借取高利貸金，遂陷於艱苦掙扎之困境中。應請政府從速撥給工業貸款，藉紓艱困。近閱報載中國生產促進會上海分會，有組織工貸銀團以救濟中小型工廠之舉，盼能早日實現，並擴大貸款範圍，公正辦理，冀符實際，而獲普遍。又如中紡公司向有配紗供給，惟對我邑用紗量最多之針織業。迄尙未有配售，望迅賜實施，以减輕成本，爭取市場。（無錫縣針織業同業公會）</p>

<p>申報館轉中央衛生署各省衛生處鈞鑒，竊本年雙桃奎寗丸價値高昂，一般投機商，但知圖利，不管病人之生命，竟公然製售僞丸圖利，査其含量，不够標準者有之，甚至有一種，全係粉質，毫無一點奎寗在內，而內地一般非正式之藥房廣貨舖及藥店，均從販賣者手中購進，仍照正牌價出售，而無知鄉愚，眞僞莫辯，購買服用，竟無效騐，以致眞貨亦失却信仰。似此阪賣製造僞藥，遺害病家，貽誤生命，實罪不容恕，特請鈞署處嚴令所屬，切實査拿，藉儆奸邪而重衛生。幸甚幸甚！（醫師余如冰）</p>
<h3>利用空地建造菜塲</h3>
<p>滬西迪化中路五原路口，沿路設有菜灘，車輪進出，非常不便，近數年來，人口衆多，居民購買小菜，擁擠不堪，兼以該處往來要道，汽車往往發生危險情事，居民往返，頗具戒心，竊意不若將在東首林森路復興西路口之大空地，建一臨時菜塲，用板木蓋成，若南市南區街之式樣，此項設備，費用不大，又可酌收攤基租費，且該地空荒已久，又可免垃圾堆積，對於衛生方面，亦有裨益。據悉，該地曾爲敵僞所有，故謹向當局建議，如能採納，對於交通安全及大衆衛生，均屬有益者。（王少甫）</p>
<h3>產權登記證費太鉅</h3>
<p>上海縣政府，以該縣淪陷八年，土地產權或變賣或移轉，爲征收便利計，辦理移轉登記，敝處屬在該縣，因黃浦相隔，往返諸多不便，（縣府在閔行居黃浦之西，而四五兩區，在黃浦之東）特派員至區公所辦理，省鄕民之往返，法良意美，惟該項手續費，每畝竟達六千八百元之鉅。而房屋每間作一畝計，市鎭之屋，作二畝計，價格之大，實出意外？聞川沙縣每畝只收五百元，何以相差十餘倍而（陳行鎭胡質夫）</p>
<h3>何故阻銷購貨券</h3>
<p>編者先生：我們是爲了敎育貸金推銷國貨市塲購貨券，我們都是學生，但是我們這次出去推銷，並非是學校裏派出去的，而是我們三民主義靑年團裏自動的出去，我們抱着有錢出錢，有力出力的宗旨，所以毫無怨尤，在八月卅日的晚上，我們行至西藏中路聖太樂內，裏面的負責人不准我們進去推銷國貨券，請問他爲什麽不准進去推銷？請問他是否中國人？我們在這樣熱的天出去東奔西走的推銷國貨券，爲的是什麽？是否爲了我們自己的私利？要知道我們爲的是國家，爲的是淸寒學生，而且並不是向他職員推銷，而向在座位上吃咖啡的客人推銷，難道他們是沒血氣的人嗎？連得自己的祖國都不關，並且叫我們到外面去，再要我們簽字，我們簽了靑年團還要什麼學校，請問他們是什麽意思，他們說：「你們隔了三五分鐘來了一班，隔了三五分鐘來了一班，是妨礙我們的營業」，那眞不是話，難道是我們高興與與你們聖太樂搗蛋，爲了自己的私利，就把國家不要了，何况我們並沒有妨礙他們營業的地方，希望以後，少存着這種自私自利的心地，不要再有這種現象產生。國貨券第三勸募隊謹上。</p>

<h3>談編結</h3>
<p>— 黃培英</p>
<p>用絨綫編結的衣服，穿起來，非常輕暖而舒適，所以非常風行，幾於不論誰的身上，都缺不了牠，所以編結的事業，有着廣大活動的範圍，有着很光明的前途，筆者於廿年前，即對編結事業，發生絕大興趣，當時除精研國內各種編結的方法外，並進而研究日本的編結方法，略有心得，因於民十七年，設一編結傳習所，以及編結用具，敎授新穎編結方法，當時來習者甚衆，出品非常受人歡迎，當時曾將出品陳列於工商部國貨展覽會，獲特等獎狀，及金質獎章等，嗣因手工出品，比較遲緩，乃參照日本人所用之代針機，加以發明改進，出品得比較手工快速三倍，此種代針機，經定名爲絨結代針器，曾獲國民政府工商部予以專利，得有專利執照，當時推銷甚廣，惟自抗戰軍興，此種代針器，未能繼續製造，勝利後雖經計劃製造，惟因種種關係，尙未能於年內與讀者見面，筆者於此，不能不深引爲憾。</p>
<p>但手工編結，祇須携一針一綫，隨時隨地，皆可工作，自有牠的便利處，惟式樣及結法，日新而月異，筆者擬於本刋的園地內，與讀者諸君，加以探討。</p>

<h3>絨綫製品的：洗濯和保存</h3>
<p>— 培</p>
<p>絨線的特質：在未說絨線製品的洗濯法前，我們應該先知道絨線的特質，絨線的主要成分羊毛的纖維有所謂外鱗，決不能用力擦揉，若過於擦揉，毛線上的絨毛便結成塊形，失去原有的美觀。毛線類的鹹性反應很弱，洗濯時務須使用良質的胰子，不然毛線便易於變硬。假若是有色的毛線，而且洗時有脫色的可能時，在未　　先，須先用止色法止色。然後再洗。止色的方法，在一升淸水裏放單寗酸一茶匙，醋酸一茶匙混合，把要洗的東西放進去浸五六分鐘，即可洗濯。</p>
<p>洗濯的方法：洗濯的方法，最初須使塵土脫去，所以淸永洗濯。洗三四回後再放入胰子水內，上下左右推動。以後用淸永漂凈再用通酸法即可。通酸法對於絨線製品，有保護毛質的光澤和防止毛質損壞的效果，所以洗濯毛線製品，最後務須施行通酸法。通酸的方法，非常簡單，一升淸水內可放醋酸半酒盃或普通酸醋兩酒盃，作成帶酸味的水，把洗後的東西放進去浸五六分鐘，即可取出弄乾。</p>
<p>乾燥的方法：乾燥的方法不能像別的東西用力榨乾，在通酸後，取出放在平板子上使之伸平，再把形狀弄平整，然後把板子斜起來放在陰凉處陰乾，就可以保持物品原有的美麗。</p>
<p>保存的方法：至於保存的方法，最重要的是，不要讓虫蛀，不要使物品變色和變質。防虫的方法第一須將汚點完全洗凈後，再收，始能生效，同時洗濯後的東西必須充分乾燥。並須放在乾燥的地方，收藏時更應該一件件用紙分包，中間更須放上樟腦或衛生球且須用薄紙袋上，以免樟腦等的粉末裝在編縫內不容易取去。像這樣包裝完後，收在櫃子或箱子，再把箱子放在乾燥陰凉的地方，不要讓太陽直接晒着，便可以預防變色和變質。</p>
<h3>母親的第一</h3>
<p>— 因果</p>
<p>十幾年來的「婦女解放」運動，確實有一部分婦女，在做着有利人羣的事，簡直不下於男人，但可惜，大部的婦女，尤其是都市裏的婦女，「解放」了以後，非但仍過着倚賴生活，甚至不願再如以前的一味屈從，而祗知享受權利，不想盡義務，更把「賢妻良母」的觀念也打破。</p>
<p>兒童是未來社會的基石，國家的棟樑，如果，要使將來的國家，社會，日臻完善，唯有極力發揮兒童敎育。</p>
<p>兒童在學校裏，所受的敎育，是機械的，並且，是有限的，敎師又不能一天到晚跟隨着學生，隨時加以敎導，所以，兒童時代的敎育，父母與敎師，應負相等責任。在學校裏，歸敎師，在家庭裏，應歸父母。尤其是做母親的，因爲，兒童與母親的接觸，較父親來得繁密，無疑的，兒童的意志，性情，都隨了母親的敎誨和訓導，而趨向了。在都市的角落裏，很容易見到，當一個母親，正醉心於呼盧喚雉，或整天的，在外面玩的時候，她們便輕易地，給孩子們錢，把看管的責任，交給傭人，或任孩子們與下流爲伍，當然，「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，孩子便學會了一切：賭博，駡人……</p>
<p>敎養一個兒童，正似培植一枝花草，若經過一個勤勉圍丁的撫護，愛惜栽植，末了，總是欣欣向榮的，反之，若遇到一個懶散的園丁，任其日灑雨淋，也不修剪枝節，無疑的，這枝花草，總歸於枯敗。</p>
<p>試看，世界上的偉人，他們的成功，差不多都受了母親努力敎誨的影響，因爲，她們能運用觀察力，鑑別兒童的心理，把握兒童的情緒，灌輸予純正的思想，來培養他們，糾正他們。</p>
<p>固然，天下每一個母親不能把她們的孩子，都敎養成偉人，但，至少不要養成對於社會，人羣，國家，毫無用處的寄生蟲。</p>
<p>願天下的母親，負起這偉大的責任來！</p>
<h3>向孩子們講理</h3>
<p>— 憶民</p>
<p>（一）非但是薔薇這樣</p>
<p>在祖母的花園裏有一枝薔薇，已經長了蓓蕾，可是好多日子還不開花，這使我感到非常燥急，因爲我急於要看牠美麗的花瓣和顏色，我預備助牠一臂之力，叫牠開花，得到了祖母的允許，我就把牠的花瓣一片一片的展開來，最後，薔薇花好像開起來的一樣了，可是牠並不像以前看見過的那樣美麗動人，無疑的，這薔薇固有的美麗給我摧殘了，並且很快的就枯萎而死。祖母看見了，溫和的對我說道：「任何事情都是這樣的，薔薇在一定的順序一定的時間下才能生出美麗的花朵。</p>
<p>（二）籃子的敎訓</p>
<p>我們家內六個孩子時時喜歡談論別人的私事，飛短流長，損人不利己，父親很討厭我們這種壞習慣，一天他帶回來一個包裹說道：「我替你們每人買了一只小籃子，當你們有什麼事情談論的時候，把牠記錄下來，放在你們的籃子裏，籃裏放滿之後，你們把牠逐一檢視，看一下究竟有多少意義沒有。起先，我們認爲這是一種可笑的工作，可是不久，我們對於發言很謹愼從事了，再一些時候，我們把這談論別人的壞習慣簡直忘了。後來，父親解釋道：「這只小籃子做了你們的監察，現在你們不會再從學校裏，辦公室，或者工塲裏帶一些無稽之談來損害別人了，雖然，你們的籃子是空着，可是比牠滿的時候更有意思呢。</p>
<h3>好妻子</h3>
<p>— 鋼人譯</p>
<p>不管你怎樣想；妳是一個並不是妳所應該是的一個好妻子，如果：——</p>
<p>你吿訴你的朋友：「頂討厭了！我的丈夫他……。」</p>
<p>你在出去單獨地參加一個晚會時，要比你丈夫伴着你出去看電影時，修飾得仔細得多。</p>
<p>你是比較喜歡吿訴你的丈夫，你已多麽勞苦地工作了一天；而不喜歡吿訴他這些工作的經騐，使你增加了樂趣。</p>
<p>當你要和自己的朋友閒談時，你就把你的丈夫和家屬丟下不去照顧。</p>
<p>你在吃晚飯的時候，把那些壞消息吿訴你的丈夫，不在你知道丈夫已有了達觀的心情時才吿訴他。</p>
<p>你從不滿意你現居的屋子，常常要一些新東西，來使它更爲美觀。</p>
<p>你修飾好了你的「家」，對於朋友的贊賞，似乎比丈夫因此而得到安慰，看得更重。</p>
<p>你沒有一些興趣去款待妳丈夫的友人們。</p>
<p>你寗願自己去選自己要的禮品，不願冒這樣的「險」，就是說不定他會買給你不中意的東西。</p>
<p>你時常這樣說：「我要我的丈夫如此如此做，」不換一種方式，說：「我希望他能這樣這樣地做，如果他願意的話。」</p>
<p>你從不讓妳的丈夫得到信任，某一種意見，正是他自己的意見；直到他好好地做到了以後。</p>
<p>你對於隨便什麽事情，從不問一問丈夫的意見。（原載TheChina　Pre）</p>
<h3>如何管理婢僕</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>凡治家主婦，對於僕婢廝養，須隨時監察，視其措施行爲，是否得當，不可略忽。監察之法，宜有常識，然後發言使命，庶幾克中繩度，俾僕曁帖然就範，無軼出常軌之舉動。下舉數端，爲主婦者應有之智識，讀者　加以揣摩，副以閱歷，得心應手，自能收指揮　意之妙矣！</p>
<p>遴選婢僕，但求勤樸無過，且須審其秉性，能服順主命與否？切勿以工資之高下爲斷，蓋誠　之僕，治事勤懇，益主非淺，宜其需索善價，若夫惰　放弛之人，偸閒好逸，或倔强難馴，工寳雖廉，得失寗足相抵。故僕之佳者，在乎克勤克儉，更須性情溫煦，無剛戾媟嫚之心，斯爲合格。反之，則管理非易，縱有長技，不宜雇用，以貽後患。</p>
<p>居家之人，衣飾服用，整潔爲上，婢僕亦然。華麗旣非所宜；而破損汚垢。則亦有失雅觀。蓋衣服垢敝，並不在貧，大半以懶惰性成，憚於洗補所致。諺曰：「一針之功，縫紉得時，足以省九針之勞。」使僕婢而不知自潔，乃冀其勤於他事，直猶緣木求魚，在勢必不可得。至於炫服靚裝，婢學夫人，亦不得謂之合式。爲之主者，宜循循善誘，敎以儲蓄，陳其利害，俾塞其奢靡之習，吿以力役所得爲數微幾。無論血汗之資，不應恣意妄耗。而食力之人，有時輟業，或則老病變患，突相侵尋，在在須得金錢爲援，茍非平素儲積，一理事發，倉卒又奚所挹。總言之，凡傭力之人，務以勤儉爲主，勿尙靡費，如衣破宜加補綴。毋遞拋棄，口腹不能縱恣。餘若購物交際，亦須隨在節制，以省財力。古語有曰：「節省一錢，即獲一錢之益」。非然者，縱慾無饜，必蹈奢侈之　，而金盡襲空，且萌非分之想，日暮途窮，失足徒悲，悔之晚矣！</p>
<p>婢僕應盡之職，事理繁多，不勝枚舉，如烹飪，洗濯，灑　，以及整理器皿，撫飼離兒。僉屬分內之事，惟烹調洗滌，各有專職，非簡舉能盡。且巨富之家，婢僕不一，每見有廚娘　婦各專其役。即或不然，而爲之主者，亦須分任其事，不能　委一人。然於灑掃　宇整潔器物之役，固爲婢僕輩通常之職，今試言之如下：</p>
<p>黎明即起，洞啓窗牗，高捲簾　，令新空氣入室，或値冬令，室有火爐，須先去爐灰及剩餘之炭屑，次乃灑掃掃。去灰之時，手法宜輕，而室中金器瓷器，與椅　壁衣之上，最好能覆以布　，以免塵灰飛集。掃地時先麗以水，亦可减經塵埃之飛揚。灑掃畢時，拂拭窗戶，凡玻璃櫃檻，以及鏡邊畫架，皆須拭抹，若有銅鋼之器，則宜以柔皮擦之，勿使生銹，苟見銹斑。須用砂紙磨挫，或塗以膠灰，必使光滑始已。他如几案椅架，一一須加揩式，母使有汚班留存，凡此諸事，舉行時刻，宜在主人未起之先，一俟主人起身，則須理寢室，爲之鋪壘茵褥，灑掃拂拭，一如前述。</p>
<p>或室中供列花瓶，及有盛水之盆，亦必按日傾換，盛以淸水。</p>
<p>每隔數日，宜取衾枕裀裯之屬，曝之陽光之中。他如灑掃樓梯，或撲擊地毯，須乘晴天，且必俟閒時爲之，勿取主人之厭。迨及晚間，則　窗鑰扉，勿怠勿忘，亦屬臧獲分也。</p>
<p>以上所論，雖但槪略，然必指導有方，乃能坐享其效，苟有錯失，亦須婉言規勸，示以恩意，使僕輩懷德來歸，庶能中心悅服。不然，雖出重資，終不能購其忠誠之心，非策之上也。</p>
<h3>救救人爲的不幸兒童</h3>
<p>— 陳新</p>
<p>中國有很多的不幸兒童，他們是些遭遇了天災人禍，早年失去了父母，有的被遺棄而流浪着，這些不幸的兒童，是應得到人們廣大同情的。</p>
<p>可是人們却沒有注意到除這些不幸兒童以外，更有人爲的不幸兒童。就是當兒童們的父親或母親有了外遇的時候，孩子們不幸的厄運就開始了。在目前這半封建的社會裏，做了母親的女子而再有外遇，是不太多的，而普遍的却是男子們。</p>
<p>我從前的理想，以爲健全的婚姻，一定能建立美滿的家庭，這樣新的一代也是幸福優秀的。可是現實把我的理想打破了。我親眼看到朋友親戚間，他們過去是經過長時期甜蜜的戀愛過程，彼此的性情，不能謂不瞭解，而且又同是爲社會服務的智識份子，可是結婚以後，甚至十年或二十年，到「綠　成蔭子滿支」的時候，辛勞的母親，已是年老色衰；可是父親的事業，却一步步走向了成功之路，一般見異思遷的男子，有了地位與金錢，便又弄一個小妾或外室。他們但見新人笑，那聞舊人哭，決不顧惜家庭幸福的破壞，更不會體騐或設想到孩子們所受的心理影響，因爲他們一天天和孩子們疏遠了。</p>
<p>一向受禮敎傳統的中國女子，即使是受了新思想洗禮的，她們決不肯隨便的喊出離婚，當她受了這意外的打擊，溫順的就沉默着把希望與情愛寄託在下一代，可是這受了刺激的破碎的心，有時會變態的無理的向孩子們發洩打，駡，甚至三不管，而孩子們對着這籠罩着陰霾的家庭，天眞稚弱的心靈，起着莫名的憎恨和妒嫉，他們得不到家的溫暖，更失去了偉大的父愛，小心靈是被摧殘了。</p>
<p>要是母親性情激烈暴燥的話、他一定會跟丈夫打吵，更因爲使用報復手段，會成天的在外游蕩，借着影院舞塲，來麻痺那失去了歡樂的心情。於是這「無父無母」的孩子們，衣食不週，冬餒常受，他們除了整天在弄堂胡鬧外，簡直已沒有了家，當他們偶然地能見到父母時，不是冷若氷霜的臉，就是打架，吵鬧，在這樣家庭敎育下，孩子們所得到的精神和物質的敎養，比那些無父無母的孤兒，也許更爲糟糕。</p>
<p>我們要敎養優秀的第二代，就要責成做父親的負起大部份應盡的責任，父親們該收歛起那自私的色慾，把偉大的父愛，來灌溉新生的幼苗。更希望每個女性，能尊重自己的人格，堅强你的理智，勿受男子們引誘，作人妾是不名譽的低卑的，沒有法律保障的，爲新時代女性所不齒的，更何况破壞人家的家庭，戕賊新中國的第二代，你們是在作貽害社會人羣的奸犯科呵！</p>
<p>我們要救救這些不幸的孩子們！</p>

<h3>歌德的晚年</h3>
<p>— 麥佛</p>
<p>湯瑪斯曼與「戀人歸來」</p>
<p>在世界文學史上，沒有再比歌德文釆煥然的巨人了。對、於中國讀者，誰都忘不了他底傑作「少年維特的煩惱」。這是一本他底自傳性的小說，出版後洛陽紙貴，不脛而走，許多失戀的少年，懷着一本「少年維持的頃惱」而自殺。</p>
<p>一七七二年的春天，正當二十二歲的華年，少年歌德驅軍去威茲勒，一個德國中部的城鎭，到帝國法院去作法律的實習。他於十六歲離開故鄉法郞克福，在萊比錫與史屈斯堡攻讀法律，其間一度患病，家居故園。在萊比錫時期，墮情於凱琴叔珂夫，在史屈斯堡時期，熱戀茀萊特麗白麗洪，旣以離別作爲結束。道些便構成了歌德初期戀愛，離別與悔恨的模型。如今歌德挾着大批的詩首，劇本，速寫與草稿抵達了威茲勒；腦袋中充滿着理想，野心與幻象；心中孕滿着眞純的熱情，反叛，與年輕的憂鬱。他正寫畢了他底第一個劇本：「馮·柏里慶」。</p>
<p>在帝國法院，歌德遇到昔日的同學開茲納，通過他，認識了他的未婚妻夏綠蒂蒲夫，她是她父親及許多兄弟姊妹的管家。相會的情形，如「少年維特的煩惱」中所寫，後來由英國幽默作家薩克萊寫打油詩道：</p>
<p>維特愛上了夏綠蒂，</p>
<p>言語從來不能表示出；</p>
<p>你要知道他第一次念應遇見</p>
<p>她？</p>
<p>她正在切着麵包和白脫。</p>
<p>可是在實生活中，那次相會</p>
<p>是在一次鄕下舞會裏，十七歲的年靑的綠蒂，穿着一件白色的衫裙，鑲着淡紅色的絲綢結。這樣他們三個：歌德，開茲納與綠蒂度過了一個牧歌式的夏季，歌德起初錘情於朋友的共同的愛情，後來終於愛上了綠蒂一個，最後却愛上自己作爲詩人與戀人的感情。秋天的時候受到了對方溫和的勸吿，他再度突然退身於到手的幸福。開茲納與綠蒂結了婚，稍後不久，威茲勒發生了一椿悲劇、另一個同學耶路沙冷，因爲單戀無望而開槍自殺。這件愚笨的事件對於歌德的影響是：他把這件事和自己近日的情緒相揉合，產生了一部小說：「少年維特的煩惱」。出版之後，全歐羅巴投入騷動之中，歌德由此成名。</p>
<p>四十四年過去了，歌德隱居在威瑪，薩克萊在他底名著「虛榮市」中又作了一首打油詩。可是此時的歌德，已是一個偉大的詩人，劇作家，小說家，政治家，科學家，愛人，樞密大臣，……他的塑像與拿壞崙悲多芬幷列；他的家屋是世界各地來進香人們必到的聖地。他從前是，而且現在也是德國最偉大的人物。他的著作浩瀚，他的全部出版的作品共有四十大卷：劇本，小說，詩，批評，——幾乎任何文學形式的都有。他寫了文學作品中最美的抒情詩，他寫了傾力一生的「浮士德」。雖然如此，他仍覺得自己沒有表現得淋漓致盡。</p>
<p>而那時候的夏綠蒂——少年維特的煩惱的女主人公——呢？正與歌德之名噪一時相反，她是默默無聞的。她替她的好丈夫生了十一個孩子；其中幾個早年夭折，如今她寡居多年。當她過子六十歲的晚年，　也率兒　女　聖地去</p>
<p>亡作家湯瑪斯曼在其名著一愛人歸來」的故事的開頭。綠蒂，六十幾歲的老寡婦，頭髮灰白，身軀肥碩，和一個近三十歲的女兒到威瑪寺。雖然面目全非，她的衣箱之中，還帶着那她初會歌德時所穿上飾粉紅綢結的自色長袍。</p>
<p>當她下了馬車，在白象旅館旅客簿上簽了姓名，立刻引起了侍役頭目馬格的注意：「難道這就是威茲勒地方的蒲夫家的夏綠蒂」？「少年維特的煩惱」他平已熟讀，今日見到書中的女主角，自然三生有幸。消息傳了出去，旅館四周擠滿了許多瞻仰風采的羣衆。</p>
<p>夏綠蒂把女兒送到妹子家去，自己寫了一封信給歌德，信中字句，她早已模擬好了：我的光榮的朋友：</p>
<p>我與女兒夏綠蒂同來探訪我的妹妹，將在威瑪小住數日。把我的女兒引見於你是我的希望，至於我自己，如果能再度獲晤昔日共遊的伴侶，如今已舉世聞名，則將欣喜莫名。</p>
<p>威瑪，白象旅店，一八一六年十月六日。</p>
<p>夏綠蒂開茲納。</p>
<p>第二天歌德設宴相邀，夏綠蒂穿了那件紅綢結的白袍，坐在歌德身旁。她說不出話來，雖然她是一個庸俗的女人，此來不過爲了要在歌德面前替妹夫說幾句帮忙話，可是在這個時候，她也說不出話來了。</p>
<p>全書九章，都十萬餘言；兩天的事，故所寫都是夏綠蒂與歌德的心理狀態。一代巨人晚年重會舊戀，便只是這麽平凡的一餐時間而已！</p>
<h3>更夫</h3>
<p>— 徐震</p>
<p>那寂寞的長夜，怎樣消磨呢！你問，讓我聽一下梆聲，再來向你陳述：</p>
<p>當失眠的毒蛇揭開了你的心幕，那末伴着夢者的　語，更夫是人間你最親切的朋友。</p>
<p>一盞燈描一條模糊的影，一根捧敲碎夜的死靜；忘却了「生」的慾念，把甜密敲進梆子裏；他那單純呆滯的朴聲，伸出翅膀，掃除一天星斗；巷裏的惡犬，對他彷彿也和善，知道是催人好夢的使者。但聰明人向他講解過「大我」和「小我」嗎？良心向他訴說過「自私」和「博愛」嗎？誰不愛甜夢，誰不憐憫自己？爲了誰他應得在夜中躑躅？然他終默默的背起了十字架。是人們所能知道他的原因？抑是天意所能猜測？像脫却了一切塵出的累贅，這就是命運？抑是他還想做時代的歌鼓手？</p>
<p>美滿的夢，雖爲你所珍惜，然僅供他一梆揮霍；失眠的痛苦，你雖憎恨，但終還給梆聲帶了回來。你常他是愚蠢的，但世界上誰不愚蠢呢？對於造物者的安排甚一至於自己的情感與理智。</p>
<p>在異鄕或客地，聽見了梆聲，幾疑置身家國的小樓，我愛這梆聲使你由憧憬而感到渴望，我無法接觸它，然我知道已漸漸的傍近了它。</p>
<h3>孤女圖贊</h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>這兒所畫的，是一個十五六歲的她是不是一個孤兒，不過我覺得把她稱爲孤兒是很恰當的，她一定沒有父母，否則她決不會在這麽年幼的時候，就失去靑春的光耀。她並不美麗，她的表情也是呆板的，甚至於襯托着她的背影和色調，也有點偏於陰暗；可是整個看來，這幅畫却非常成功，它給我們一個很深的印象，使我們感到一種深切的悲哀。這種悲哀，凡是在惑情中生活過，在生活中反省過的人，都可以親切的體會到。並且，在我們注視着這幅畫的時候，我們的表情，也應當和這個孤女一樣，是一種茫然的悽楚。</p>
<p>她的頭髮是蓬鬆的，她的面容也非常憔悴，在她的眼睛裏可以看到一種朦朧的幽暗——她是個可憐的人。顯然的，她已經把美麗的追求放棄了；道種追求，或許在她苦難的身世中根本沒有意識到，或許是在不斷的打擊和失望中逐漸放棄了的。因爲每個女孩子，不論媸姸，總希望把自已表現得美好；而她却沒有這種希望，她面部的表情是鬆懈的，她的神彩也過於暗淡，她的限睛已經像一個飽經憂患的人，是偏於反省和內視了。這種人在我們的時代中可以說隨處皆是，可是直到我們看見了這幅畫，我們才開始驚訝：我們竟沒有深切的觀察過。</p>
<p>靑春是美好的，可是能够享受靑春的並不很多，得到靑春的人，不會意識到它；等他意識到的時候，靑春已經在苦難中蹓去了。我曾經看到過一幅畫，在水的波紋裏，隱的的畫着一個滿縐紋的女人的臉，題目是「似水流年」——似水流年，這一個只有十五六歲的女孩子，已經失去了心靈的光耀，難道在我們這苦難的時代中，十幾年的時光，竟抵過了承平時代四五十年的歲月！</p>
<p>達文西的「蒙娜莉莎」是一幅快樂的圖畫，在那兒我們看到了一種心靈的喜悅；這種喜悅幾乎是神性的。可是能够得到這種喜悅的，竟有幾人？我們每個人都有自己的夢想，在正常的生活中，我們實現了這種夢想，在拂逆的環境中，我們追求它；可是道個零丁的女孩子，她的夢想，却彷彿已經擊碎了。她一定曾在苦難中哀哀的啼哭過，在失望中在暴的怨忿過，現在，一切都風平浪靜了，她呆呆的凝視着，——這只是一種深沈的死寂。</p>
<p>我對於這幅畫的喜愛，是喜愛它的蘊藉和深刻。平常過年的時候，我們可以在市上看到許多紅紅綠綠的人物圖，這種圖畫，色彩非常誇張，人物也非常的多。對於小孩子，這是種可愛的東西，對於生長在承平時代的鄉下人，這也是非常有趣的。可是在我們看來，總覺得沒有生命，沒有內容，只是些浮在紙上的形象。然而把這裏的一幅畫打開來看一看，這兒却透露着一個苦難的時代，也透露着一種顚沛流離的生活！</p>
<p>對於一個十幾歲的女孩子，生活應該是輕鬆的，然而不然，她已經失望了。她沒有受過較高的敎育，沒有人開導她，使地把這種苦悶，轉變到一個更高理想的追求。她只希望得到一種正常的生活，一種最起點的正常生活，她只希望得到一點最平淡的溫情的培餐。然而連這一點小小的希望都不能得到，於是她失望了。這種失望，正代表着整個人類，對於生活的忍從。</p>
<p>最後我奇怪這幅畫的作者竟有這麼深刻的觀察力，她平日總是歡歡喜喜的，我以爲她一定不知道什麼是苦悶，我以爲她對於人生的認識一定是浮表的；然而我錯了，她的觀察力竟比我們深刻得多，她的表現手法又那麼純熟；這可以看出來，一個人平日的表情，不一定代表他的內心，在這複雜的時代中，生活到底是多方面的。</p>
<h3>示長女</h3>
<p>— 戴望舒</p>
<p>記得那些幸福的日子！</p>
<p>女兒，記在你幼小的心靈：</p>
<p>你童年點綴着海鳥的彩翎，</p>
<p>貝殼的珠色，潮汐的淸音，</p>
<p>山嵐的蒼翠，繁花的　錦，</p>
<p>和愛你的父母的溫存。</p>
<p>我們曾有一個安樂的家，</p>
<p>環繞着淙淙的泉水聲，</p>
<p>冬天曝着太陽，夏天籠着淸蔭，</p>
<p>白天有朋友，晚上有恬靜，</p>
<p>歲月在窗外流，不來打攪</p>
<p>屋裏終年長駐的歡欣，</p>
<p>如果人家窺見我們在燈下談笑，</p>
<p>就會覺得單爲了這也値得過一生。</p>
<p>我們曾有一個臨海的園子，</p>
<p>牠給我們滋養的番茄和金筍，</p>
<p>你爸爸讀倦了書去墾地，</p>
<p>你媽媽在太陽陰裏縫紉，</p>
<p>你呢，你在草地上追彩蝶，</p>
<p>然後在溫柔的懷裏尋溫柔的夢境。</p>
<p>人人說我們最快活，</p>
<p>也許因爲我們生活過得蠢，</p>
<p>也許因爲你媽媽溫柔又美麗，</p>
<p>也許因爲你爸爸詩句最淸新。</p>
<p>可是，女兒，道幸福是短暫的，</p>
<p>一剎時都被雲鎖烟埋；</p>
<p>你記得我們的小園臨大海，</p>
<p>從那裏你們一去就不再回來，</p>
<p>從此我對着那迢遙的天涯，</p>
<p>松樹下常常徘徊到暮靄。</p>
<p>那些絢爛的日子，像彩蝶，</p>
<p>現在枉費你摸索追尋，</p>
<p>彷彿看見你從我這間房</p>
<p>到那間，用小手揮逐陰影，</p>
<p>然後，緬想着天外的父親，</p>
<p>把疲倦的頭擱在小小的繡枕。</p>
<p>可是，記着那些幸福的日子，</p>
<p>女兒，記在你幼小的心靈：</p>
<p>你爸爸仍就會來，像往日，</p>
<p>守護你的夢，守護你的醒。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　42</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>匆匆向鼎元吿別，帶着傳訊的三個人，回到站裏，消息仍舊沉沉。「也許在晚上發動？……也許明天？」我這麽揣測着。誰知剛在十一點半的當口，衣櫥內收音機的信號響動了。</p>
<p>「喂，老朋友嗎，午飯已經備好了，專門候着你一人哪！」</p>
<p>「好的，我這就動身了。」我答覆着</p>
<p>「午飯」或是「早點」，或是「晚餐」，或是「宵夜」等等，是我們議定了的隱語，指着日人的初步發動「動身」的意思，指着我所担任的破壞工作。</p>
<p>「六三一，六三一，總部，」我着手發動特工公用密碼電訊，收訊者是瀋陽參謀總部。不到兩分鐘，已有回音，我知道密碼已經接通，於是趕緊將預擬的電訊發出：「秘急，預定「三部曲』計劃，已迎漏，對方已有準備，〇三五支北」。我胃用天津電台的密碼。</p>
<p>這就是我同王冷齋計劃的破解方法。日人腦筋，非常拙笨，心胸十分狹窄，而又多疑；因此，一有秘密計劃，最怕聽到「洩漏」兩個字。設若一旦聽說洩漏了，不問眞假，必定手忙脚亂，大起騷動；甚至把全盤計劃，完全推翻。我所計劃的破解方式，就是根據這個心理擬定的。</p>
<p>照我的推測，總部收到這條急電之後，必定立刻下令，吩咐北平特工機構，停止預期的動作，或臨時改變方式，取消的會。</p>
<p>果然，約莫一小時光景，我們總部的同志已有　電，說總部首腦收到急電後，十分憤怒，痛駡北平的特工主持人，及軍政活動領領導們，說他們簡直都是渾蛋，連這種重要的計劃，都被洩漏出去。洩漏的責任，都放在松井一人身上。這傢伙就是上次伴送我回長辛店的笨虫。</p>
<p>然而您要說他眞是一條笨虫，却又不然。傍晚六點鐘左右，我們收到了情報，知道這傢伙下午仍舊不動聲色，按照約定的時刻帶着今井等幾個亡命之徒，和十多名射擊好手，一擁而至進德社北平冀察委員長行轅，一方面要試探行轅裏究竟有多少力量的準備，一面仍舊打算蠻幹一下。意思設若弄倒幾個，也可將功折罪。</p>
<p>誰知到了行轅裏，一進門，全部射手都被攔下，名雖請他們在休息室裏用茶，實則被衛隊室裏二十餘名彪形大漢監視住了。然而松井這傢伙，仍不死心，仍舊和今井等帶着三五個隨員，衝到客室裏，指名定要宋哲元親行接見。</p>

<h3>邊環圖畫</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>街頭巷尾，出租出售迎環圖畫的攤頭甚多，在每一座攤頭，往往都簇擁着一羣兒童，其年齡自八九歲以二至十歲，甚至還有許多成人婦女，有人曾喩爲街頭敎育，然而這種敎育是危險的。</p>
<p>危險是在於這些連環圖畫的故事內容。</p>
<p>這一說法是有根據的，最近最近就有一個例子：</p>
<p>二十二日早晨五時北京路發生一件胞弟殺兄嫂的血案，　兇手之妹稱：兇手平時歡喜看連環圖畫，其臨行兇之夕，尙在看「翠屛山」一書，不料竟效石秀殺起兄嫂來，所以或係中了連環圖畫的毒。</p>
<p>連環圖畫的故事內容，大抵不出奸淫盜賊和神怪三類，因爲是用圖畫表現的，而且取費甚廉，發行廣泛，因之便更普及火衆深入民間，這對於社會的影響太大了。</p>
<p>爲救救兒童着想，當局是應該積極予以取締的。</p>
<p>我曾經和有關當局談過這個問題，據他們說，他們也早就注意到了，但在取締時，道些書的出版者却很理直氣壯地拿出內政部登記核准印行的執照來，使我們倒感到相當狼狽。</p>
<p>倘使以上是事實，我們除請本市主管當局據實呈報外，並請內政部澈底査究一下，究竟這些含有毒素的書刋，憑什麼能發給准許證？是什麽人在承辦此事？其中有無其他情事。</p>
<p>自然，我們也更希望那些出版家們別昧着天良在賺這筆殺人的血腥錢！</p>

<h3>總有一天到月球</h3>
<p>— 大維</p>
<p>（編者按：當一　科學均爲戰爭而準備的今日，我們極希望科學家們能够將研究原子彈及細菌戰的興趣移到對月亮的研究上去！）</p>
<p>肉眼看來，滿月只是一隻亮盤子，上面有斑駁的黑影。這乃是這個衛星的表面：有沙漠，平原，山嶺，火山石，山谷和噴火口。地球上大部常見的東西都在上面，只是那裏沒有湖泊，海洋和生物。</p>
<p>天文家曾將月球表面仔細精確的畫了圖。他們對於上面的裂口，火山石，山谷，平原等知道的比地理學家對於地球上隱僻的地方還要詳細。</p>
<p>他們也知道月球上面的情形。那裏從白日到夜間氣溫高低相差很大。月球上的白天，等於地球上的兩星期，太陽直射表面，並無像地球上的空氣層阻隔，結果，日中時石頭熱到可以燒開水，只有洞穴或崖壁的陰影下，才是黑暗的，人類才可在那裏生活。</p>
<p>月球上的夜間也是兩星期，表面的熱很快的放射到空中，氣溫可能低到任何液體凍結。</p>
<p>比任何困難都嚴重的是上面沒有空氣，一個人從地球到月球上，倘毫無預防的話，很容易的因體內空氣壓力而爆炸，就像有些深水魚從海底出來太快時一樣</p>
<p>要克服這些危險，月球探險家應應當有特別的奘備。他們需要「月亮衣服」，一種設計週到，完全關閉而能動的護體，須能像潛水衣一樣可以供給同氣壓的空氣，並具有其他使人在月球上能够生存的必須設備，像溫度控制器及電力操縱的器械。</p>
<p>一件衣服重七百磅</p>
<p>這樣一件笨重衣服在地球上是不能用的。然而在月球上的地心吸力差不多僅有地球的五分之一·一百八十磅的男子到了月球上只有三十五磅，一件在地上七百磅的衣服就只有一百四十磅了。爲了保護人，這件衣服須要沉重，使他可以保持平衡，控制肌肉。</p>
<p>這件七百磅的衣服說不定會成什麽樣子，牠應當具有每方吋能忍受十五磅內在壓力的力量。而又須柔軟使穿着的人容易移動。　須有自己的動力機械——也許是爲了適應月球上日間的日光發電機和夜間用的貯電池。牠的空氣調節器必須能够不斷的將呼出的空氣重新製造，裝進新鮮氧氣，再放入循環供給器。牠或許必須能抽出空氣中呼出的以及身體蒸發的濕氣，淸潔後再供應用，因爲水和空氣都必須從地球帶去</p>
<p>這件月亮衣服還須有內部及外部的發光器，以備在月球的夜間應用；還須有熱的絕緣體，發熱及冷却器的裝置以備日夜之需。馬達和管制操縱「手臂」，「手指」及其他表面工作器械的裝置以及無綫電和雷達器械都是爲着交通，指示方向及畫圖的。此外，須有食物貯藏處以備探險者離開基地時所用，其餘如對於健康，舒適及便利工作的裝置也是必須的。</p>
<p>如果這種服裝可以製造（好像沒有什麽理由不可以），那麽聰明有決心的探險家們不但可以在短期內生存，並且可以在月球上澈底的考察一下。</p>
<p>能够作此種月球旅行的火箭馬達，至少須比現在所有的兩倍效能。空中火前須有一秒鐘七哩的驚人速度，物理學家稱之爲地球的「解放速度」。這就是說，一且火箭達到此等速度，馬達可以關掉，而火箭可能因動力由地球發出。假使瞄得準確，可以射到月亮上。</p>
<p>什麽時間遠征月球</p>
<p>月球遠征隊到達月亮的最好的時間是月球的早晨，這樣探險家可以有兩星期的日光，使他們一切的裝備和生活適應當地的環境。他們降落後的第一件事應當，是將火箭裝好以備回來之用。他們可以輪流出去考査。駕駛員應該駐守在基地，和出去的隊員及地上聯絡。地質學家和礦物學家出去探求寶貴的金屬及礦物，硏究殖民的可能性，帶回月亮上的石頭作更進一步的研究。</p>
<p>考査結果應當立刻報吿給地球站，以免任何意外發生使遠征隊不能回來。</p>
<p>在第二個月亮上的白天（就是地球上的第廿八日），他們可以準備回程了。在去的路上須準備一秒鐘七哩的速度，回來時只須這速度的五分之一，因爲月亮上的「解放速度」是一秒鐘一·四哩。</p>
<p>照以上說來，月亮是很値得硏究的地方。牠也許會成爲地球上的戰勝者堡壘。牠也許成爲下世紀中，星球交通系統的第一站。（譯自九月號柯里爾雜誌）</p>
<h3>理想妻子與理想丈夫</h3>
<p>— 黎心</p>
<p>〔編者按：本刋在八月三十日登了一篇芝薇先生的「我的理想夫人」，提出對於他未來太太的條件後，許多讀者響應這一問題，也有囑將信件轉與芝薇君的；足見靑年朋友們對婚姻問題的迫切興趣。這里僅將來函中擇其一二，發表如下，也許對於在愛情十字路口徘徊的靑年有所參考。〕</p>
<p>人到了相當的年齡，選擇終身伴侶是一件重要的事；但，每個人各有不同的理想。</p>
<p>我認爲，理想中的丈夫應具備下列各點：</p>
<p>容貌端正，服裝整潔，但不必過份修飾；不崇尙時貌，一窩風的去買玻璃褲帶等貨品。這是儀表上的美。</p>
<p>唔「烟」「酒」「嫖」「賭」等惡習慣；要求「智」「體」「德」「　」各育的增進。這是天性上的美。</p>
<p>身體强健，精神活潑，沒有可能遺傳及傳染的病症。這是生理上的美。</p>
<p>知識優良，至少須受十二年以上的敎育；勇於服務，有捨己爲人的精神，要有明確的判斷力和獨立的思想。這是知識和行爲上的美。</p>
<p>「理想的丈夫」方能娶到「理想的妻子」，你認爲對嗎？</p>
<h3>不是買東西</h3>
<p>— 笑薇</p>
<p>我嘆息這人世間人性「自我心」的過强，　引起一切大小的衝突　　　的戰鬥，各有各的一套八股，都要使世界都去跟隨它去符合它，激烈的主義者，更不惜以流血手段，使世界一下子去符合它，結果，反使人類未享其福先受其苦。對於婚姻問題我深感關切，但雙方一定要開出如何如何的條件，我是反對的。擇偶固不能亂來，但却不全像買東西。</p>
<h3>一封自荐信</h3>
<p>— 徐也野</p>
<p>芝薇先生：</p>
<p>這次不知怎的，竟下了決心寫這封信來，在封建色彩尙濃的山城裏，此舉似近子荒唐，唯其如此，請先生不可輕視了。</p>
<p>自我介紹：</p>
<p>我是專科學校畢業的，我愛我的工作，我忘不了學習，務使自己多了解一點自己時代需要。</p>
<p>我只敢說在我的小生活圈內遇事尙可平心靜氣去處理。</p>
<p>對於「眞，善，美」三字，先生願加詳解嗎？生活要怎樣才能踏上「眞，善，美」的境地呢，然而不管這些，我要使生活單純，柔和，無濃艶之感？</p>
<p>我的面孔很平常呢！先生，我們這裏的女人都是十分樸素，比先生的五，六，七條理想，還要樸素，自然我也不能例外。</p>
<p>小家庭或可料理得好。</p>
<p>旅行是我唯一的愛好。</p>
<p>根據上面幾點，無論與你有無多大相違之處，我總希望能同先生做異地異性的朋友。我沒有去過熱鬧的都市，尤其是號爲天上人間的上海。我很想在先生那裏認識。我對先生雖無貢獻，但能時時報吿一些繁華塲所中所沒有的</p>

<h3>平民院長：居正</h3>
<p>— 喬治</p>
<p>「短衫赤脚，手持鋤耙，剪草澆花，悠然自得。」</p>
<p>「余生也晚忽耆年，閱書滄桑海已田，調鼎鹽梅慚　理，同根箕豆怯燃煎，南華夢幻迷莊蝶，西域風雲唳杜鵑，且喜秋高人老健，不知不識順其大。」</p>
<p>以上是司法院長居正先生在十一年前所撰「六十自　詩」中的一節，目前正値秋高氣爽，我們的居先生也是老而益健，詩句內容，和當前環境依售吻合。下月的二十日，便是居先生的七秩晋一大慶，稱觴賦句之時，重讀舊作。必多感喟吧。</p>
<p>院長在平房里</p>
<p>我稱居先生爲平民院長，因爲他雖貴爲院長，私生活却無異尋常百姓，戰前他在首都和平門附近築有一所佔地十一畝的居處，在這樣廣大的地面上，却只搭蓋低矮的平房幾間，較之其他顯要們巍峨高崇的洋房，眞有雲泥之別。當時地價屋價，一共祇有七千元。每當夕陽西沉，這所屋內，常有一個短衫赤脚，頭戴草笠的老農人，手持鋤耙，剪草澆花，臉上顯出悠然自得的神態，說來恐怕不易使人置信，這個老農就是堂堂的居院長。</p>
<p>居氏不僅喜歡農夫的生活，而且還自命爲澳人，二十五年六月十四日。他曾偕同夫人來滬寄住新亞酒店，登記册上的是假姓名，職業項下更塡註了「農人」兩個字。</p>
<p>深懂生活藝術</p>
<p>他厭見生客，但是却高興寫字，向他求書，不論熟魏生張，一律應酬。他愛學習騎馬，他嗜食的東西是：豆腐。</p>
<p>居先生是湖北廣濟人，字覺生，幼年曾留學日本。提到日本，居氏和她之問，有一段佳話：當孫總理在海外奔走革命的時候，居先生隨從寄居東瀛，爲了居夫人——鍾女士，寶同籍——生育　密，而居氏奔走國事，頗以兒女成行爲累，有一個日本朋友萱野長知，願意替他撫養一位女公子，從此居小姐受日本家庭的撫養，受日本敎育的薰陶，忽忽二十年之久，居氏爲國馳驅，竟將此事擱諸腦後，直到民國二十五年六月，居小姐從養父萱野口中得知自己的身世，方才回國，骨肉團圓，眞有說不出的悲喜交集。</p>
<p>居先生現有一子三女、長女即爲早歲寄居日本的萱野長子，已下嫁張銘君爲妻。公子名浩然，畢業淸華大學及中央軍校，現在軍界供職，抗戰時曾參加前綫作戰。</p>
<p>我們要平民官居院長，人們對他的第一個印象是：「生活在平民一起」；我們今後所需要的「官」也就是這一類的官。如果說我們對居院長特別有好感的話，唯一的原因就是因爲「他平民化」。</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand People Excited and Enthusiastic: Nanchang Grand Gathering Welcomes the Head of State; Chairman Delivers Instructions to Encourage the Building of a New Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] Chairman Chiang is likely to leave Nanchang on the 24th. It is rumored that he will first go to Ganzhou, then fly to Guangdong for inspection, and return to Nanjing within a week.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Authentic sources say that this is Chairman Chiang's first visit to Jiangxi after the victory, and he is moved by the enthusiastic welcome of the Jiangxi people. Therefore, he plans to stay a little longer, and the date of his return to Nanjing may be delayed by a few days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] The Jiangxi Provincial Capital's All-Circles Welcome Ceremony for the Head of State and Expanded Memorial Week was held jointly at the Nanchang Stadium at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. As many as two hundred units participated, and as many as one hundred thousand people attended. More than eight thousand surplus officers from the Sixth Military Officer Corps also marched in formation to the meeting, causing the roads around the lake inside and outside the venue to be crowded with welcoming people. However, the order and atmosphere of the meeting place were extremely solemn and enthusiastic. As the bell rang nine times, Chairman Chiang, dignified and kind, arrived by car. The entire audience stood at attention and welcomed him with applause. After the meeting began, Chairman Chiang led the attendees in performing the ritual. First, Ouyang Wu, a 66-year-old respected elder, and Xu Ronggui, a 71-year-old farmer representative, presented a "Perseverance of All Nations" brocade banner to the Chairman on behalf of all circles. The Chairman accepted it with a smile and repeatedly said, "Thank you." Then, Xu Xiangxiang, a representative of the Youth League, presented a memorial book signed by 1,500 members. After the presentation of the banner and memorial book, the Chairman delivered instructions, encouraging everyone to bury themselves in hard work to build a new Jiangxi [the original text is below]. It lasted forty-five minutes, and the masses accepted his comfort and kindness with enthusiastic applause from time to time. The meeting then ended with shouts of "Support the Head of State," "Obey the Head of State," "Long Live the Kuomintang," "Long Live the Republic of China," and "Long Live the Head of State." The Head of State also walked out of the meeting place amidst cheers and music, waving frequently to thank the crowd for their respect. Then, he boarded the car and returned to the official residence.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Chairman's Instructions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Jiangxi Provincial Capital's All-Circles Welcome Ceremony for the Head of State at 10:00 AM on the 23rd is published as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Wang, Elders and Compatriots from All Circles of Jiangxi, Military Officers and Comrades, Young People, Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, Zhongzheng has come to Nanchang to meet with our elders and compatriots from all circles of Jiangxi. This is truly the most memorable day of my life, and it is also the day I feel the happiest and most self-satisfied.</p>
<p>Great Contribution</p>
<p>Most of the elders and compatriots present today still remember that in 1926, I led the National Revolutionary Army on the Northern Expedition from Guangdong, passing through Changsha, and then defeated the warlords in Jiangxi and recovered Nanchang. Therefore, Nanchang was our first base for the Northern Expedition. At the same time, the men, women, old, and young compatriots of Jiangxi all supported the National Government and were loyal to the National Revolution. Their contribution to the Northern Expedition was truly great. It can be said that the rapid completion of the Northern Expedition was largely due to the wholehearted support of our compatriots in Jiangxi Province in providing resources and manpower. This is a major event that I have never forgotten in the past twenty years regarding the compatriots of Jiangxi. From 1931 to 1934, Jiangxi Province was mired in long-term banditry. It can be said that there was no clean land in Jiangxi at that time, and the lives of the compatriots were truly as deep as water and as hot as fire. When I first arrived in Nanchang, the general society's fear of banditry was almost more severe than that of floods and fierce beasts. During this period, the total number of compatriots in Jiangxi who were sacrificed due to banditry was at least five million or more, and the loss of property was countless. However, since the implementation of the New Life Movement in 1933, the psychology of fearing bandits has been completely changed. At that time, men, women, old, and young in Jiangxi were not only unafraid of bandits, but also deeply hated the inhuman actions of bandits who killed, set fires, and committed atrocities. Our compatriots in Jiangxi, no matter how difficult and distressed they were, and how displaced they were, their loyalty to the government and their support for the revolution were truly persistent. From the beginning to the end, they believed in the government, obeyed orders, and worked together to avenge the bandits. Therefore, in less than two years, that monstrous disaster was extinguished. By the winter of 1934, the order of society had gradually stabilized. From this, it can be seen that our compatriots in Jiangxi all have revolutionary enthusiasm, can protect their homes and defend their country, and love their country and themselves. They are truly worthy of being modern citizens. Unfortunately, in 1937, the Japanese invaders launched the Lugouqiao Incident, and then China launched a full-scale War of Resistance. During the eight years, under the leadership of the government, the comrades and compatriots of Jiangxi Province obeyed orders and consistently fought to the death with the enemy. From this, it can be seen that Jiangxi made a great contribution to the victory of the War of Resistance. Everyone remembers that our national policy of resistance and all subsequent war plans were decided at Lushan in Jiangxi. It can be said that Jiangxi is the birthplace of the victory of the War of Resistance. In short, Jiangxi has made indelible contributions to the development of the National Revolution in the past twenty years, and occupies the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese Revolution. This historical glory must be cherished and promoted by all our compatriots in the province, so that it will last forever.</p>
<p>Building Jiangxi into a Model Province with the Spirit of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>However, this time I came to Jiangxi, just as Jiangxi was devastated after the long-term War of Resistance, and the people were suffering. I cannot bear to feel the pain and sadness. However, based on past experience, I am confident that the spirit of construction and the power of recovery of our Jiangxi compatriots are no less inferior to those of any other province in China. Jiangxi suffered from a long-term bandit disaster for six years from 1930. However, when the banditry was quelled in 1935, not only did the social order quickly recover, but also all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce had a thriving atmosphere. In particular, the construction industry was advancing rapidly. Within two years from 1935 to 1937, the Gan-Zhe and Gan-Xiang railways were completed, and the main lines of the provincial highways were completed. Moreover, the Ganjiang Bridge was built. Other educational and economic constructions are too numerous to mention. This great construction force is something that we should especially encourage ourselves to develop. I believe that if the compatriots of Jiangxi Province can work together as they did in the past, under the leadership of the provincial government, and bury themselves in hard work, then within three years, Jiangxi Province will surely be built into a model province for the whole country.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, there is one more point that I want to bring to the attention of all compatriots: The main reason why Jiangxi was able to achieve such great achievements in the past in the revolution, the War of Resistance, and the suppression of bandits was that we had a spiritual power. What is this spiritual power? It is the New Life Movement that I advocated in Nanchang on February 19, 1933. The essence of this movement is to incorporate the four dimensions of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame into the daily life of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and to achieve the goal of enhancing the national spirit and promoting national morality through the reform of daily life. This movement also originated in your Jiangxi and was later widely promoted throughout the country. I believe that this movement has had the greatest impact on the success of the suppression of bandits at that time and the victory of the War of Resistance today. In the future, the work of national construction will be even more arduous than the War of Resistance in the past. Therefore, I hope even more that our compatriots in Jiangxi will follow the spirit of the New Life Movement from the beginning, understand propriety and righteousness, know integrity and shame, take responsibility, observe discipline, endure hardship and work hard to complete the construction of our new Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Helping Retired Military Officers to Continue Their Efforts in National Construction</p>
<p>Finally, when I came to Nanchang, I also saw the students of our Military Officer Corps being welcomed and cared for by the general public, loving each other sincerely, helping each other, and cooperating. I felt very happy in my heart. Everyone knows that in the past twenty years, all officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army have been sacrificing and fighting hard at all times. It can be said that following my command to fight, they have never had a day of peace. After the Northern Expedition, they continued to suppress bandits, and after suppressing bandits, they continued to resist Japan. Their merits and achievements are worthy of the love and respect of all compatriots in the country and will never be forgotten. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, more than 150,000 officers retired under the order of the government, abandoning their existing military posts and sacrificing their lofty positions. This major event can be said to be an unprecedented achievement in China since its own history. This is the greatest progress in our Chinese politics and military, and it is also the highest expression of the national personality and revolutionary spirit of all Chinese soldiers in saving the country. This proves that today's truly patriotic and people-loving army and officers have no selfish or self-interested ideas, but only a pure and bright heart, loyalty to the country, and love for the compatriots. Therefore, our compatriots must follow the spirit of supporting the government and loving the National Revolutionary Army in the past twenty years to love them and help them, so that they can continue to serve the country after ending their military life and participate in the work of national construction. Only in this way can we express the sincere intention of our general compatriots to respect virtue and repay merit. Our military officers and comrades must love and respect themselves even more, be thrifty and disciplined, and set an example for society and a model for the people, so that they can truly complete the mission of our National Revolutionary Army to resist Japan and build the country.</p>
<p>Zhongzheng is very happy to meet with our elders and compatriots in Jiangxi today. There is no other way to express my gratitude and comfort in my heart. I only have a heart full of enthusiasm and sincerity, and I am willing to encourage each other with my Jiangxi compatriots to work hard for the construction of a new Jiangxi and a new China. I wish all the compatriots of Jiangxi Province health and progress.</p>
<h3>Chairman Holds Tea Party to Entertain Guests; Meets with Director Cai to Instruct on Relief Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] Chairman Chiang held a tea party to entertain Chinese and foreign guests in the auditorium of the provincial government at 4:30 PM on the 23rd. The attendees included Duncan, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) stationed in Jiangxi, Schmidt, the Archpriest of the Catholic Church, Gao Suifu, the Christian pastor, Peng Chengwan and Ouyang Wu, prominent local figures, and Zhou Lingyuan and Hu Dexin, the descendants of the late General Zhou Hunyuan and the late Division Commander Hu Zuyu, totaling more than one hundred people. During the party, the Chairman stood up and delivered a speech, expressing his sincere intentions for the construction of Jiangxi. He stated briefly: Construction projects must proceed from small to large, from near to far. The construction of Jiangxi should start from Nanchang, and the construction of the whole country should start from Jiangxi. Jiangxi, with its past cultural prosperity, the intelligence of its people, and its superior material conditions, if supplemented by modern scientific organization and other technologies, will surely achieve rapid progress in construction. Finally, the Chairman encouraged all party, government, and military circles in Jiangxi Province to work together under the leadership of Chairman Wang, burying themselves in hard work, and believed that within three to five years, Jiangxi would surely become a model province for the whole country. The Chairman praised the work of UNRRA and hoped that everyone would learn from the working spirit and methods of Westerners. After the speech, the entire audience applauded. The tea party ended in joy at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang met with Cai Mengjian, Director of the UNRRA Jiangxi Branch, on the 23rd and gave detailed instructions on relief work. Also, during the tea party on the 23rd, the Chairman greatly praised Duncan, the UNRRA representative in Jiangxi, and the working spirit of his foreign staff, as well as their close cooperation with the UNRRA branch office. He also stated that farmland irrigation is very important and should be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lisheng Talks to Our Reporter About the Government's Attitude Toward the Current Situation: Judging Facts with Reason and Awaiting Results with Patience</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When Zhang Lisheng answered our reporter's inquiry about the current situation on the 23rd, he briefly stated: Although peace talks are currently stalled, all parties are still in constant contact. We should judge facts with reason and await results with patience, and believe that there is hope for success in the end.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Ambassador Stuart's private advisor, Fu Jingbo, talked with Mr. Pi Zonggan for about 45 minutes at 11:00 AM. There were no other activities. According to observations from various parties, it seems that they are waiting for Chairman Chiang to return to Nanjing before making any progress. A spokesman for the Communist Party delegation said tonight: Mr. Zhou Enlai is in Shanghai, waiting for news. As soon as the Military Mediation Team meeting is scheduled, Zhou will return to Nanjing immediately.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng and Four Others Held a Discussion Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] In the process of political negotiations, after the Communist Party submitted the second memorandum yesterday, government representatives still had contact with each other today, except that the Communist Party representatives did not travel back and forth. This shows that while waiting for the Chairman to return to Nanjing, the government is still trying to find appropriate ways to achieve peace. After the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 23rd, Wu Dingfu, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Peng Xuepei, and Wang Shijie held a discussion to study the current situation. At noon, Wu returned to General Chen's residence on Putuo Road and talked with Chen for a long time, and had lunch together. It is generally believed that government representatives are studying the requests made in the Communist Party's memorandum, and it is reported that Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, and others will have dinner at the U.S. Embassy on the evening of the 24th to discuss the purpose of the situation.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Marshall Discusses General Issues with Yu Dawei</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall met with Yu Dawei at his residence at 8:15 AM on the 23rd and talked until 11:50 AM. According to Yu, they were still discussing general issues of the current situation, but it is generally believed that they were studying the content of the Communist Party's memorandum. The main purpose of the memorandum is to convene the Military Mediation Team meeting. Yu is the representative of Xu Yongchang, the government representative in the team.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] The efforts of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart to mediate have been temporarily stalled. Reliable sources say that Marshall and Stuart do not intend to launch mediation again for the time being. It is expected that there will be no change in the deadlock until Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing. Marshall does not intend to respond to the memorandum proposed by the Communist Party until he exchanges views with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>China Signs the International Monetary Fund: Exchange Rate Fluctuations Are Restricted; Economic Experts Discuss Currency Devaluation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] Although the official solemnly declared that the exchange rate will never change, the foreign exchange market in Nanjing still fluctuates according to the Shanghai market. The street trading rate today is 3,550 yuan of legal tender for one U.S. dollar, and large bills can only be exchanged for 3,400 yuan. It seems that most people dealing in U.S. dollars are optimistic about the increase. According to an economic expert who is closely related to China's monetary system, China is a signatory country of the International Monetary Fund. The Fund stipulated a month ago that each member country should register its permanent and stable exchange rate against major gold standard currencies (i.e., the U.S. dollar, the British pound, and the French franc) with the Fund within three months after issuing the final notice. The purpose is to prevent major devaluations of national currencies before the specified deadline. After the deadline, China and every other signatory country must be bound by the registered exchange rate. If the domestic situation requires the currency to be devalued again, the devaluation value may not exceed one-tenth, and this adjustment must be implemented at least six months after registration. Responsible observers are well aware that a 13% readjustment is not enough to cope with possible and frequent devaluations. Therefore, it is necessary to announce a final devaluation once again within two months. If, unfortunately, the situation continues to deteriorate after this devaluation, China still has the right to withdraw the devaluation restriction from the International Monetary Fund. However, this move is tantamount to declaring national bankruptcy to the world, which no country would want to do.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 23rd] After Shanghai rumors that the official exchange rate of legal tender against the U.S. dollar will be readjusted again, the market price of the U.S. dollar in the open market here has reached a new peak. As of now, the highest price is 3,610 yuan.</p>
<h3>Eastern Section of Longhai Railway to Open to Traffic Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The railway between Kaifeng and Xuzhou in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway was severely damaged by the Communist army some time ago, resulting in heavy losses. Recently, the military situation has improved, and the repair project of the section has progressed rapidly. The entire 194-mile damaged section was repaired in just one week. The Ministry of Communications received a call from Xuzhou on the 23rd stating that the road will open to traffic on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] It is reported that the transportation authorities are considering extending the western section of the Longhai Railway to Lanzhou and have sent experts to Tianshui for field research. After the westward extension of the railway, it will be very beneficial to the development of the Yumen oil mine and the consolidation of the northwest border defense.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Assigned to New Position</h3>
<p>Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] Ma Zhanshan, Deputy Commander of the Twelfth War Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Advance Army, has now been transferred to the post of Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Arrives in the Old Capital from Suiyuan by Air; Important Meetings Held in Beiping; Contact Occurs on the Eastern Chahar Front Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] With the Battle of Zhangjiakou imminent, the Beiping military authorities have important consultations tonight. Fu Zuoyi, Commander of the Twelfth War Zone, arrived in Beiping by special plane from Suiyuan today, arriving here at half past noon. As for the Qingyuan area of the Ping-Sui Railway, there has been no news of war already underway today. The battles in Suidong and northern Shanxi have gradually passed. Nie Rongzhen's unit of 13,000 men has fled along the Ping-Sui Line from Datong to Yanggao, while Xiao Ke and Ye Ning have withdrawn in a straight line to Zhangjiakou. In the southwest, the Communist army of 6,000 men, fleeing from Xinglong and Deqing, is attempting to threaten the flanks of the National Army and destroy communications.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] It is confirmed that the National Army will launch a three-pronged attack on Zhangjiakou, and the steps will be decided tonight and the advance will officially begin immediately. The Beiping Eleventh War Zone Headquarters will hold an important military meeting tonight to echo the First War Zone. Other important military commanders are scheduled to fly to Beiping this afternoon to participate in the meeting. In addition, the Chahar Provincial Government Security Team stationed in Nankou has received notice to advance with the army tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] Confirmed news: Frequent contact between the Guomindang army and the Communist army's first line of defense in Kangzhuang and its surrounding areas in eastern Chahar began yesterday. Several small strongholds have been taken over by the Guomindang army. This is the prelude to the Guomindang army's official advance. Kangzhuang has entered the artillery range of the Guomindang army and can be quickly captured once the battle begins. It is reported that the new tactics adopted by the Guomindang army in the future will be to make the Communist army in important strongholds retreat automatically. In addition, Jiaogezhuang, thirteen kilometers west of Shunyi on the Pinggu Line, was occupied last night by four regiments of the Communist army transferred from eastern Hebei. The battle was quite fierce. The Guomindang army is now counterattacking. The actions of this Communist force seem to be restraining the advance of the Guomindang army on the Pingsui Road and threatening the Pinggu Road.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] The newly recovered routes are being actively repaired. The western section of the Pingsui Road has been opened to traffic to Fengzhen and will be opened to Datong within days. The Pinggu Line has been repaired to the vicinity of Shixia today. In addition, the rails between Tangshan and Kaiping on the Beining Road were destroyed by landmines this morning and quickly repaired.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] Rumors that the airfield here has been destroyed are not true. A mail plane from the Beiping Executive Headquarters landed safely here today and took away a radio operator from the government group because he was suffering from severe tonsillitis here.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] There are no visible signs of tension here, except for one air raid alert every day. Most residents are still living their normal and peaceful lives. The government's attack on Zhangjiakou seems to be imminent.</p>
<h3>A Historic Feat: 150,000 Soldiers Disarm, Military Men are True Heroes, Chairman Praises the Sixth Officer Training Corps</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd] At the Nanchang Provincial Capital's Welcome Rally for the Head of State on the morning of the 23rd, Chairman Chiang, after consoling the people of Jiangxi, publicly praised the Sixth Officer Training Corps for its great achievement. He expressed great satisfaction with the Corps' more than 10,000 demobilized officers' sincere unity and close cooperation with Nanchang's 200,000 citizens, which has won widespread praise. At this point, the Chairman, in a moving speech, specifically mentioned that after the victory, the government, in accordance with its established policy of reorganizing the national army to complete the grand plan of military demobilization, saw immediate implementation of the reorganization work after an order was issued. To date, at least 150,000 officers have complied with the order to retire and enter various officer training corps to receive various vocational training suitable for national reconstruction needs, a feat unprecedented in history (loud applause). The soldiers of the Republic of China are all aware of the importance of today's nation-building task. Our nation-building work can be fully completed (loud applause from 100,000 people in the entire venue). This is indeed a rare miracle in the 5,000-year history of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>When this reporter visited the Qingyunpu Sixth Officer Training Corps on the 13th of this month to inquire about the professional training of the various brigades under the Corps, the direction of vocational education, the vocational aspirations and numbers of the officers, the morale of the demobilized officers entering the Corps for training, the views of the demobilized officers on the future of the nation, and the thoughts of the demobilized officers on their own future, the reporter could not help but say to the colleagues, "The government's measures for the vocational training of demobilized officers, formulated for the thorough implementation of the grand plan of military demobilization, are unprecedented in ancient and modern times, in China and abroad. Compared with the backward thinking of 'releasing military power with a cup of wine and granting land as fiefdoms' in the Han and Tang dynasties, it is truly 10,000 times more brilliant and 5,000 years more advanced. Our 450 million compatriots should not just verbally support the head of state and obey the head of state, but should experience the head of state's painstaking efforts and virtuous intentions from the head of state's nation-saving and nation-building plan, and support the head of state's grand plan for military reorganization and demobilization that is braver than the Han and Tang dynasties and wiser than Europe and the United States. Because Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang did not have resettlement methods for the discharged soldiers, and Europe and the United States had reemployment methods but no vocational training, to enhance the martial virtue of the Chinese nation and solve the most dangerous and headache-inducing troop reduction problem in the 5,000-year history of the Chinese nation."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang was very pleased to hear and see everything about the vocational training of our country's officers during his visit to Nanchang this time. He personally comforted General Chen Pei, the commander of the Sixth Officer Training Corps, and the three deputy commanders and seven brigade commanders for their efforts to solve the difficulties for the demobilized officers. If the demobilized officers themselves and their families have important difficulties, General Chen Pei can report them to the Chairman for resolution. After this news was announced, the 8,000 demobilized officers who participated in the welcome rally for the head of state today, although they walked for five hours and stood for two hours, did not feel tired at all. Among them, some had served as commander-in-chief or deputy commander-in-chief, and some had served as army or division commanders, but now their food, lodging, clothing, and transportation are the same as those of a soldier. When senior officers can relive the life of a soldier and enjoy it, this is not a regression, but a progress. Enrolled in the Sixth Officer Training Corps, they continue to receive academic and technical training. Regarding the officers undergoing vocational training, the number in September is 9,428 for infantry, 48 for cavalry, 148 for artillery, 244 for engineers, 36 for transport, 214 for transportation, 14 for civil engineering, 124 for military police, 298 for political work, 349 for military supply, 53 for accounting, 11 for technology, 151 for military dependents, and 243 for military medicine, totaling 11,456. Among them, the vocational aspirations of the demobilized officers are as follows: 206 for transportation, 1,904 for industry, railways, post, aviation, electricity, and police administration, 1,334 for new army cadres, 16 for military service class, 485 for administrative officials, 449 for agriculture and forestry, 420 for further education, 345 for labor service, 215 for public compulsory education, 1,536 for mine management, 305 for finance and finance, 5 for studying in the United States, 204 for local health, 80 for Army University, and 54 for officials, totaling 9,330. The ranks of the demobilized officers in the Corps are as follows: 11 lieutenant generals, 73 major generals, 509 colonels, 876 majors, 2,400 captains, 2,162 first lieutenants, 2,295 second lieutenants, and 1,189 warrant officers. It is also found that the total number of officers undergoing vocational training in the Sixth Officer Corps in September was 9,700. As of today, the total number of people allocated is as follows: 9,700 total personnel in September, 447 retired and left the team, 142 volunteered to go to the Northeast, 1,929 retired, 9 discharged, and 2,100 transferred to the provincial training group. (Individual vocational training) 24 for agricultural reclamation, 74 for finance, and 22 for land surveying. (Transferred to Xuzhou) 41 designated, 330 undesignated, 572 participating in aquaculture training, 241 new army cadres, 375 technical officers, 333 police officers, 856 military officer districts, and 61 journalism officers. From the above statistics and figures, we can imagine the importance of the tasks of the other 25 corps in the country based on the organization, number of people, and achievements of the Sixth Officer Training Corps. We hope that each officer training corps will have good results to show and use the facts to slap the mouths of those new warlords who use the military to harm the people. We should cheer, based solely on the current brilliant results of troop reorganization, "150,000 soldiers disarm, military men are true heroes."</p>

<h3>The Situation in Northern Jiangsu Can Be Clarified Soon: The National Army Tightens the Encirclement; The Southern and Northern Lines are Coordinating and Progressing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] After the National Army recovered Huai'an and Huaiyin, the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu lost its main stronghold. The Battle of Huaiyin was a crucial turning point in the situation in Northern Jiangsu. In that battle, the Communist Army mobilized 24 regiments, personally commanded by Chen Yi, to resist stubbornly. The National Army recovered the city, causing more than 20,000 casualties to the Communist Army and capturing 5,000 people. The elite troops have lost most of their strength. Following the Battle of Huai'an, more than 5,000 Communist troops were annihilated. The remnants of the Communist Army are like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, having lost their combat effectiveness. They are collapsing towards Lianshui. The National Army is now pursuing the enemy east of Huai'an and Huaiyin. The National Army on the southern line of Northern Jiangsu, in coordination with the progress of the northern line, is tightening the encirclement of the Communist Army from the front lines of Yangtai. The Communist Army in Dongtai, the airport, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Bin Ying, and Lianshui are all shaken. This reporter came to Xuzhou today to meet with a senior general of the National Army. He predicted that there would be no major battles in Northern Jiangsu, and the National Army would clarify the situation in Northern Jiangsu in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 23rd] In addition to continuing to mop up the suburbs of Huai'an, the main force of the National Army is advancing towards Cheqiao.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Sources said that the recovery of Huai'an and Huaiyin dealt a fatal blow to the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu. In the future, the National Army may divide its forces into two routes. One route will advance to Lianshui to complete the northern encirclement network, and the other route will go north directly to Gaobin to connect with the National Army in Yangtai, connecting the Grand Canal embankment. At this point, the Communist Army lurking in the lake and marsh area in central Northern Jiangsu will retreat without fighting.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] There is still no major progress in the battle on the eastern line. The troops going north are still stranded near Bin'an. The bridges and telecommunications equipment on the Haitai Highway are difficult to repair in a short time due to the Communist Army's severe destruction. The Communist Army in Xiaoji, Fanchuan, and Xinghua have continued to reinforce Gaobin for days. Yangbin will defend the Grand Canal embankment to the death. It is expected that if the Communist Army suffers another crushing defeat on the Grand Canal embankment, it may continue to defend the Gouwen on the west side of the Fan Gong embankment, so that the Communist Army can have a way to retreat.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 23rd] According to official sources, the Communist Army in the Lianshui, Shuyang, and Gouyun areas has recently completely captured young men and women and moved them to southern Shandong and Yanfu. The area most affected by the Communist Army's capture is near Gaojiagou on the border of Lianshui and Shuyang, where all young men and women have been taken away, leaving no one behind. Judging from the current situation, the Communist Army is about to abandon Lianshui.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan said today that the Communist Army will adopt large-scale guerrilla tactics throughout the country. Except for Harbin and Zhangjiakou, the Communist Army will abandon all strongholds. The loss of Huaiyin and Huai'an is only the beginning of the battle in Northern Jiangsu. In the future, the Communist Army may be forced to withdraw from Bin'ying and Gaoyou, which is also possible.</p>
<h3>Relief Flour for Northern Jiangsu Refugees Still Not Delivered; The Chairman Has Ordered the Executive Yuan to Expedite</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The 5,000 tons of flour for the relief of refugees in Northern Jiangsu were allocated by the Executive Yuan to the Suning Branch in early September, but have not been delivered to date. The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has caused the refugees to not be able to obtain practical benefits. When the Chairman was in Gu, he ordered Director Chiang to expedite the matter. In addition, the flour that the Executive Yuan should have allocated for refugee relief in Northern Jiangsu in May is still nowhere to be found.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Shandong Province Busy Mobilizing, Military Conference Held in Yucheng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 23rd] The Communist Army's attempt to launch a war in Shandong has become increasingly apparent. It has been reported that the headquarters of the Communist Army's Bohai Military Region has moved to Yucheng in northern Shandong to work. A military conference is currently being held to decide to start military activities to eliminate the National Army on the north bank of the Yellow River and plan to destroy transportation and blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The National Army has taken strict precautions. The Communist Army in southern Shandong is still busy mobilizing, with about 10,000 people near Yanzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] The National Army is now using the seven county towns of Caoxian, Heze, Chengwu, Dingtao, Jinxiang, Shanxian, and Jining as bases to continue to develop in the rural areas and eliminate the remaining Communist Army. The situation in western Shandong has been greatly stabilized. The people of these counties who fled outside the province have been helping the old and carrying the young, and they have been moving back to their hometowns in groups. The grand scene is only seen after the victory. The Communist Army near Yanzhou Qushi has launched attacks on the National Army again for days. Its 16th regiment of the police brigade, with more than 500 people, attacked the Jin Kou Ba and the airport near Yanzhou from the east bank of the Si River in the early morning of the 21st. After a head-on attack by the National Army, a fierce battle lasted for about half an hour. The Communist Army was killed more than 30 people, and the rest retreated to the original place in Daliushu Lingcheng. In addition, more than 300 Communist troops attacked the guard force of the Datancun factory east of Jining on the 20th, and were repelled by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Minister Yu Reports at the Memorial Week: Postal and Telecommunications Services Will Implement Price Increases; Railway Construction and Restoration Will Be Carried Out in Separate Zones</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The central memorial week was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd. President Dai Chuanxian presided over the meeting, and Minister of Communications Yu Dawei reported on the recent transportation situation, briefly analyzing the current situation of railways, highways, waterways, aviation, postal services, and telecommunications. Yu said: At present, transportation, especially the construction and restoration of railways, is of utmost importance. It is being carried out in the southwest and northwest regions and the southern and northern China regions, with the Bohai Road as the boundary. However, there are many difficulties such as the lack of road repair materials, low transportation costs, and lack of training for railway employees, which greatly affect the progress of the work. Therefore, we are urgently planning to repair the highways built during the war in various places to supplement the inadequacy of railways, and at the same time encouraging local governments to repair roads, especially the southwest highways, which are extremely important. We are determined to work hard to maintain them. Waterway transportation is also being improved, and port affairs are being reorganized. As for aviation, the biggest difficulty at present is the lack of equipment. The lack of aircraft is secondary. It is now unsustainable due to erosion. A price increase is necessary to maintain it, so we plan to increase the price at an appropriate time, but not to increase it too much.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] This reporter visited Minister of Communications Yu Dawei in the evening and asked about the postal and telecommunications price increase plan. Yu said: A price increase is inevitable, but the timing of implementation is still uncertain. When asked whether it would be brought up at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th, Yu repeatedly said ["No"].</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Gather in Paris</h3>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has been going on for a month, but no agreement has been reached. All parties are concerned and eager. The war has just ended, and the opinions of various countries on rebuilding the peaceful order in Europe are not entirely the same, and they do not want to act hastily. This is exactly the phenomenon that should be present in making peace. Therefore, we should not have any feelings of disappointment about the slow progress of the Paris Peace Conference. While the Paris Peace Conference was in progress, we saw the US Secretary of State, the Soviet Foreign Minister, and the British Foreign Minister leave Paris one after another, either going to Moscow, inspecting the war zones in Germany, or returning to London. Later, we saw US Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Germany and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech at the Peace Conference Subcommittee, each clarifying the foreign policies of the United States and the Soviet Union. At this time, US Secretary of Commerce Wallace gave a speech in the United States, advocating appeasement of the Soviet Union. As a result, public opinion was in an uproar and condemned him. Wallace had to resign. Now that Wallace has resigned, the storm caused by Wallace's speech has gradually calmed down, and the four foreign ministers have gathered in Paris again. The Paris Peace Conference, which had been suspended, may become active again, and the foreign ministers' meeting, which has been shelved for a long time, may be reconvened. Thus, after a period of suspension and turmoil, Paris will once again become the center of international diplomatic activities. Based on the developments of the past few weeks, we would like to make a forecast of international politics.</p>
<p>The world situation in the year since the armistice has obviously stopped all the coordination during the war due to the cessation of hostilities. Originally, the maintenance of this coordination lacked a considerable practical basis and was only a wartime compromise. In order to maintain this wartime compromise, even Roosevelt, who advocated international justice, did not hesitate to abandon his principles and his position, and not only built a high iron curtain with the Soviet Union, but also spread its "new democracy" of socialist countries outside the iron curtain. The post-war world was obviously shrouded in this atmosphere. Under this situation, Wallace advocated returning to a new "glorious isolation" and treating China as an "uncivilized land," watching the sparks of Europe and the Far East across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although the appearance of this Wallaceism is in the form of "new isolationism," it actually inherits some of the mantles of the Anglo-American appeasement policy before the Second World War. Therefore, we must seek the foreign policies of Britain and the United States from other aspects.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart clarified the US government's enlightened policy towards post-war Europe. Later, British wartime Prime Minister Churchill also gave a speech in Switzerland, advocating the establishment of a European Federation, so that Europe could almost restore its prosperity. Churchill, as a person in opposition, cannot represent the intentions of the British government. However, the Labour Party, which is currently in power in Britain, although advocating the implementation of socialism, which is considered "unscientific" by Marxists and Leninists, cannot be compared with the Soviet Union's "new democracy." Therefore, Churchill's speech may also represent the opinions of some British people. The ideal of a European Federation is not new to Europeans. After the First World War, French politicians advocated the establishment of a European Federation, but the situation at the time turned the ideal into a dream. Now that Europe is under threat again, perhaps Europeans will feel the need for such an organization, but whether it can be formed is still in a vague state.</p>
<p>Will the result of this evolution make the world one world, or will it become two? In reality, one world is only a lofty ideal, and the real gap has long existed! The world is a troubled time. We certainly do not want to see the distance of the gap widening, but rather pray that everyone should fill this gap at this time. However, in the effort to fill this gap, we have the right to demand that all major countries should make concessions for the safety of all mankind, and we must not rely solely on our side, or even sacrifice the principles we uphold like President Roosevelt in order to accommodate reality. How to make efforts to fill this gap depends on the achievements of the foreign ministers in Paris.</p>
<h3>The Door to US-Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>Wallace's resignation was discussed in this newspaper yesterday. We are planning for the overall situation of the world, and we certainly feel that Wallace's speech cannot represent the US government's foreign policy, so the US government has the need to ask him to step down in order to seek consistency between foreign policy and external policy. However, in any case, we are still very sorry for the occurrence of this unfortunate fact. Because the door to US-Soviet cooperation seems to be separated by a layer of curtains again.</p>
<p>Here, we would like to state another view: Wallace's foreign policy is to make concessions to the Soviet Union, and Byrnes's foreign policy is to be tough on the Soviet Union. This difference is very obvious. Can concessions win the cooperation of the Soviet Union? Can toughness win the submission of the Soviet Union? No one can predict these two points. However, Byrnes's tough policy, to this day, seems not only to have failed to make the Soviet Union dare to symbolize it, but has instead made the barriers between the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly sharp. Wallace's foreign policy, standing in the position of the Americans, seems to have the necessity of trying.</p>
<p>The two biggest points in Wallace's speech and letter to Truman are that he did not have a definite grasp of the serious problem that the United States and the Soviet Union do not trust each other because of the differences in political and economic systems, except that he himself "firmly believed" that it could be solved. The opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union, as pointed out in this newspaper's editorial on the 19th, is a conflict between two kinds of democracy. In other words, it is a conflict between American democracy and Soviet communism. Wallace's plan for US-Soviet reconciliation purely focuses on military and economic aspects, and ignores the lofty ideals of human politics. Wallace was originally an agricultural expert and served as Secretary of Commerce, specializing in agriculture and commerce. People who pay attention to the superficial phenomena of human life tend to ignore the ideological activities of human beings that promote the realization of superficial phenomena.</p>
<p>Thought is the source of phenomena. According to Hegel's view, the human spirit, with the evolution of history, demands its own realization everywhere and at all times. Now the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, the struggle between the two major groups in the world, is not a struggle between atomic bombs and naval bases and ports, but a struggle between two great ideologies demanding their own realization. The fourteen communist leaders in the Kremlin, in order to realize their ideas inherited from Marx, will not hesitate to pay any price, take any means, and no international treaty can bind them. Under this situation, unless American society undergoes a fundamental revolution and becomes a Soviet-style "new democracy," US-Soviet cooperation is still uncertain. Even Wallace himself did not tell the American people how much certainty there was.</p>
<p>However, Soviet-style "new democracy" is not welcomed by Americans except for a very small number of communists. Not only capitalists do not welcome it, but even workers do not necessarily welcome it. The United States today is the most prosperous country, and the living standards of its people are higher than anywhere else in the world. Since life is comfortable and they enjoy a high degree of democratic freedom, among all the workers in the world, American workers have the least awareness of communist revolution. And the United States has no hope at all. Even in other democratic countries, unless it is within its own military range, there is no hope. The Greek referendum is a clear example. Human beings certainly want to live, but they also want freedom. The biggest flaw of Soviet-style "new democracy" is that the people have no freedom!</p>
<p>Some people believe that Wallace's speech was a probe from the White House in the United States. The US government is unwilling to go to war and is willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, but any cooperation is not a one-sided matter. Since the US President let Wallace give a speech, if the Soviet Union has a sincere response to cooperation, the US's tough foreign policy towards the Soviet Union may gradually change. If this observation is correct, then President Truman's request for Wallace to resign is exactly his expression of disappointment after hope! Because since Wallace's speech was published, in addition to praising Wallace and scolding Byrnes, the Soviet official newspaper has not made any concrete statements on the part of the government. Under such an attitude of the Soviet Union, President Truman has no reason to adopt Wallace's suggestion and offer the secret of the atomic bomb to Marshal Stalin with both hands.</p>
<p>We are very sorry for Wallace's resignation, because his speech did open the door to US-Soviet cooperation once, but now that the guest is not coming and Wallace has resigned, this door seems to be closed again. However, we still hope that this door can be opened again at any time, and we believe that it will be opened again one day. In China, we pray even more that the door to US-Soviet cooperation will open sooner. The people in power in the United States may as well learn more about the Soviet Union and study the background of communist thought. The Soviet leaders may as well walk out of the Kremlin and take a look at the true face of the world. When they understand each other, it will be the time when world peace truly sprouts.</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Suppressing High Interest Rates</h3>
<p>High interest rates are one of the most troublesome problems currently faced by the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>On one hand, there is inflation, and on the other hand, there is a sense of excess capital with no way out. According to normal theory, interest rates on short-term loans should be low at this time, and high interest rates should not occur. However, theory is theory, and reality is reality. This kind of contradictory phenomenon is not the only one in the current economic sphere.</p>
<p>As a result, the Four Banks' tight monetary policy has attracted special attention from the general public. All kinds of loans are being applied for continuously by various industries and businesses in various places; the deposit and withdrawal amounts of commercial firms and banks are also being discussed; whether loans of more than 50 million must be approved by the Four Banks is also being criticized; and some people have even raised the fundamental question of whether the Four Banks themselves should continue to exist.</p>
<p>There are, of course, legitimate reasons for the Four Banks to tighten the money supply and refuse to lend. Judging from the intention, stabilizing prices and avoiding further stimulation are the main reasons. Recalling the beginning of the establishment of the grain loan, within two or three days, rice prices in various places experienced a great surge. Therefore, their cautious attitude can also be said to be well-founded.</p>
<p>However, the existence of high interest rates is a fact, the difficulty of turnover felt by the general industrial and commercial sectors is also a fact, and the closure of many factories and shops is even more of a fact. It is said that the current interest rate in Japan is only about two percent, and in Taiwan it is only about six percent. Then, whether the short-term interest rate of one and a half or even two percent in this port is too high for the industrial and commercial sectors that need to compete with others, and whether it should be improved, really does not need further discussion. Have those officials and financial giants who preside over the Four Banks never thought of this?</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for high prices: one is inflation, and the other is insufficient supply. These are the most obvious facts. Because of the result of tightening the money supply, many production industries have been unable to sustain themselves; the supply of materials will inevitably gradually decrease in the future. Is this situation indirectly raising prices? This issue should not be ignored!</p>
<p>Moreover, the rising trend of prices does not seem to be stopped or reversed by tightening the money supply. In recent days, major commodities such as gold, U.S. dollars, yarn, cloth, rice, wheat, flour, cooking oil, woolen cloth, and rayon have not been soaring again? On the one hand, the rising trend remains the same, and tightening the money supply does not have the slightest inhibitory effect. On the other hand, it has forced industrial and commercial sectors to collapse and indirectly promoted the rising trend. We believe that this approach has indeed reached the stage where it should "correct mistakes when they are known". Be careful not to stubbornly continue to make mistakes to the end, causing China's industrial and commercial sectors to be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Central Bank's "Hundred Cities Edition" Banknotes Still Accepted and Used as Usual</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Recently, merchants and residents in this city have often mentioned that the Central Bank's 1,000-yuan and 500-yuan banknotes printed by the Fuda Printing Bureau in Southeast provinces and Fujian in the 34th year of the Republic of China are not woodblock prints. However, due to wartime printing, limited to materials, and prolonged use, they are inevitably blurred. The bank has always accepted and used these banknotes as usual. Holders of old banknotes can send them to the bank for exchange at any time.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military in Shanghai Sends Personnel to Chengdu to Rescue Missing Pilots</h3>
<p>Will Use Helicopters in the Area</p>
<p>[United Press, This Port] Several U.S. B-29 pilots were forced to land near the border of Burma two years ago and were captured by the Kuo Kuo tribe and used as slaves. Recently, they were discovered by church people in the area, who notified the U.S. military in Chengdu, which in turn informed the U.S. military in Shanghai. The U.S. military authorities in Shanghai sent three representatives to Chengdu yesterday to contact the church people who reported the incident. The representatives are expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow to report. According to those familiar with the customs of the Kuo Kuo tribe, the Kuo Kuo tribe will not release the captives without receiving a ransom, and will generally demand food and salt in exchange. The U.S. military authorities are willing to accept reasonable demands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] McConnell, head of the U.S. Air Force Advisory Group in China, said today that the U.S. Air Force in China has been ordered to do its best to rescue the American pilots who went missing in the Kuo Kuo area of western Sichuan. Any rescue organization that wishes to set out to inquire about the whereabouts of the missing American pilots will be assisted by the Air Force under the group. According to McConnell, the mountain roads in the Kuo Kuo area are rugged and uneven, and the Kuo Kuo people are naturally wild, so rescuers have to use helicopters to facilitate the search.</p>
<h3>Five Major Traitors, Including Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun, Were Officially Escorted and Imprisoned Yesterday. Zhou Wore Black Gauze on His Arm, Seeming to Mourn for Wang Jingwei.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The "escort" procedures for the five major traitors, including Zhou Fohai, were completed on the 23rd. At 12:30 noon, Chen Shengzu, a prosecutor from the Capital High Court, and eight bailiffs took a large open car to the detention center at No. 19 Ninghai Road to complete the transfer procedures. First, Chen and Director Zhang discussed everything in detail. At 2:30 p.m., the bailiffs were ordered to set up posts at the door and roadside. Then, they moved the luggage onto the car. At 3:00 p.m., the traitors came out one after another. Zhou led the way holding a palm-leaf fan, followed by Luo and others. Each person was monitored by a bailiff. Then, because the car was slightly damaged, Zhou and others returned inside. About ten minutes later, Zhou boarded the car again. Zhou and Ding sat in the driver's seat, and the rest sat in the carriage. When the five traitors came out, they all lowered their hats to their shoulders to avoid being photographed. The clothes and attitudes of the traitors were as follows: Zhou wore a Palissy long gown, with black gauze wrapped around his left arm, seeming to mourn for Wang Jingwei, black leather-soled shoes, and a felt hat. Luo wore a gray striped short suit, yellow leather shoes with elastic sides, and a gray felt hat, with a cunning smile on his face. Ding wore a black felt hat, a blue cloth long gown, black cloth-soled shoes, and carried a small white package in his hand. His face was pale, his expression was dejected, and his eyes were dull. Ma wore a dark blue striped fine wool long gown and had a stiff attitude. The traitors carried a total of nine large packages, three suitcases, a large can of biscuits, and two thermos bottles, for a total of thirteen items. Yesterday, Ma's wife brought ten packages, and it was said that there were still three suitcases and many other scattered items. The prison authorities were worried about criticism from others, so they temporarily left them behind. A quarter of an hour after Zhou left, Ma's wife, female nurse, and maid came to visit. They were very distressed to hear that he had been escorted away. They immediately wanted to take the luggage away, but the prison authorities agreed that they could come to pick it up tomorrow morning. After leaving Ninghai Road, they went straight to the detention center of the Capital District Court at Laohuqiao. Then, because the detention center was also overcrowded, they began interrogation and inspected the luggage at the same time, which was completed at night. It is said that the five traitors were separately detained in Cell Nos. 4 and 6 of the Loyalty Prison. According to Director Wan, they will enjoy the same treatment as ordinary prisoners and will not be allowed to take any special actions.</p>
<h3>Special Agent and Traitor</h3>
<p>Tian Chongguang Executed in Hankou</p>
<p>[Li Bao, Hankou, 23rd] The well-known special agent and traitor Tian Chongguang was recently executed in Hankou. According to reports, the traitor had served in various puppet positions under Ye Daopeng. Then, he suddenly transformed himself and was appointed as the direct team leader of the Military Statistics Bureau in Hankou. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the traitor was detained by the enemy in Beijing. The enemy, believing that he could be exploited, sent him to Tokyo, where they induced him to reveal work secrets and used the Tokyo radio station to communicate with Chongqing, giving the enemy great convenience in intelligence. After the victory, Tian went to Chongqing and was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau and transferred to the Wuhan Headquarters Military Law Department for interrogation. Tian was executed in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Roxas Sends Letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Speaking in Mitigation for Japanese War Criminal Jimbo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Philippine President Roxas has sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, speaking in mitigation for Japanese war criminal Major Jimbo, who is currently detained in Jinan. Roxas was arrested by the Japanese when they occupied the Philippines, but was saved by Major Jimbo. The Philippine President sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek requesting clemency for Jimbo purely because some Japanese people who wanted to detain Jimbo had urged Galolo. After complicated methods, they finally informed Roxas of Jimbo's current situation. In his condolence letter to Jimbo's wife, Roxas authorized his secretary to say that the President believed that Jimbo had "risked his life, violated the order from his superiors to execute Roxas, and continued to request a stay of execution."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Seeks to Rescue Overseas Chinese Trapped in Bagan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The diplomatic authorities are very concerned about the 20,000 overseas Chinese trapped in Bagan, and are determined to do their best to negotiate with the relevant parties, and plan to send a delegation of overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies to investigate, strengthen on-the-spot negotiations with Britain, the Netherlands, and Indonesia, and investigate the damage suffered by overseas Chinese in military conflicts in various parts of the Dutch East Indies.

<h3>"Coolie" Chinese Laborers Return Home from Bangka Island</h3>
<p>The Dutch Break Their Promise and Shamefully Abandon Them</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 23rd] Before the war, from 1935 to 1941, there were more than 4,000 so-called "coolie" Chinese laborers on Bangka Island near Sumatra. They accepted contracts with the Dutch government to work in the tin mines on Bangka Island. During the Japanese occupation, they were severely abused, resulting in the death of more than half of them. Currently, because the contracts have expired, their situation is very difficult and pitiful. They all wish to return home. The Dutch have decided to send them back in batches. The first batch of 1,300 people left Bangka Island on the 21st of this month. One of the workers told reporters that according to the contract terms, the Dutch should provide full travel expenses for those who have served for two years, as well as a subsidy, a pair of shoes, and a hat, but the Dutch broke their promise and only promised to issue ten guilders per person when they arrived in Hong Kong. Whether the Dutch will keep their promise is doubtful. Overseas Chinese in the banking sector have raised donations and distributed three and a half guilders to each person.</p>
<h3>The Siamese Government Discusses Regulations on the Entry of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 23rd] Local newspapers reported that Siamese Foreign Minister Chaiyanam and Interior Minister Ning Korang jointly discussed the details of the proposed regulations on the entry of overseas Chinese yesterday. Since our ambassador Li Tiezheng arrived in Bangkok, Siamese newspapers have published reports on the issue of regulations on the entry of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese believe that this is a test to explore Ambassador Li's attitude towards this issue. According to Ambassador Li to a Central News Agency reporter a few days ago, he does not believe that the Siamese government will adopt regulations on the entry of overseas Chinese, because other countries have lifted or abolished entry restrictions as a gesture of friendship to China.</p>
<h3>The National Health Movement in Nanjing Begins Propaganda Week Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The New York Herald Tribune Publishes an Article Refuting Zhou Enlai's Statement, Saying That Its Purpose Is Purely for Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The New York Herald Tribune yesterday refuted Zhou Enlai's statement that the policies of the United States are undermining the Chinese economy. The newspaper commented that Zhou's remarks were purely for propaganda and attempted to damage the reputation of the United States. The newspaper's editorial, entitled "Mr. Zhou's Propaganda," reads in full: The most absurd statement in China recently is Zhou Enlai's statement that the policies of the United States are undermining the Chinese economy. These remarks made by Mr. Zhou, a communist official, are obviously purely for propaganda purposes, and their purpose is obviously to undermine the reputation of the United States as much as possible. If Mr. Zhou is really concerned about the erroneous image of the Chinese economic situation, then he can easily list its real causes, because he, like other people, has clearly observed that the causes are not mysterious at all. The first and most important cause is that the Chinese government has lost all its best sources of revenue while in office, so it has to rely on issuing banknotes to survive, which has caused terrible inflation. The second reason is that the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists has delayed economic recovery, part of which is due to the effective cutting of transportation lines by the Communist army. The third reason is the inefficiency or corruption (or both) of many officials in the government. The fourth is the Soviet Union's destruction or removal of industrial equipment in the Northeast. Mr. Zhou instead attributes this to the United States, arguing that after some U.S. surplus materials were handed over to the Chinese government, they flowed into the black market. If this statement is true, it is not important except in Shanghai and most other cities. If it is said that China's suffering is due to the United States selling materials that its army and navy no longer use to China, then this statement can fully demonstrate its unreasonableness and senselessness.</p>

Gui delivered a welcome speech, saying that Admiral Brind is a navigator who has made great contributions in the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans during World War II. He is very pleased to visit China this time. The relationship between China and Britain has always been friendly. In the past, General Fraser has provided a lot of assistance to our navy. For example, the training of our naval officers and soldiers is almost the same as that of the British navy. This is all due to the cooperation and mutual understanding of both sides. The General and his party will stay in Beijing for a very short time and will leave Beijing tomorrow. He hopes that during this period, they can be made as comfortable as possible. He raised his glass to wish for the health of the British Emperor, the prosperity of the British Navy, and the health of General Brind. Admiral Brind then delivered a reply, first expressing his gratitude, and stated that the Central Navy will be able to become more friendly under the principles of cooperation and mutual understanding. He raised his glass to wish the Republic of China prosperity, the Chinese Navy prosperity, and General Gui health.</p>

<h3>The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Reopens; Bevin Meets with Molotov Yesterday; The Conference Discusses the Issue of Former Italian Territories</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 23rd (broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this afternoon and then met with Bidault to discuss convening a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. According to the BBC, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be convened within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers issued a declaration today agreeing to submit the issue of Italy's African colonies to the UN General Assembly for a decision.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 23rd (broadcast): The main part of the peace treaty with Italy began to be discussed at the conference this morning, namely Article 17 of the peace treaty, the issue of former Italian colonies. The original four-power draft contained three points: (1) Italy should renounce its rights to its former colonies; (2) the existing government authorities, namely the "British and French Military Government," should continue until the fate of these colonies is definitively resolved; (3) the four powers will decide the fate of former Italian colonies within a one-year period after the signing of the peace treaty with Italy. Representatives of various countries then expressed their opinions one after another. Italian representative Bonomi said that Italians have a historical action in Africa, and now more than 100,000 Italians reside in the various territories, forming the basis of the economic foundation of the various territories. Italians cannot give up these colonies without any legal protection. Bonomi then expressed his gratitude for the Soviet and French suggestions to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to change the political system of the former Italian colonies into a trusteeship! He also requested that the Italian delegation be allowed to continue to participate in the work of the government in its African colonies. Representatives from Egypt and Abyssinia requested the return of the Istrian territory. Egypt also requested the Kalfu grass source in Libya and the Solun Plateau in Libya at the same time. The Egyptian representative further proposed that Libya be governed by the member states of the Arab League. Abyssinia stated that it was willing to temporarily give up the former Italian colony of Somalia, but reserved the right to express its views on this issue in the future. The Brazilian representative supported the proposal to place the former Italian colonies under trusteeship, but this would become an amendment to Article 17 of the peace treaty. New Zealand requested that the fate of the Italian territories not be decided solely by the four powers, but should be decided by the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Harriman Appointed U.S. Secretary of Commerce; Expresses Absolute Support for Byrnes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] President Truman announced today that he has appointed Harriman as Secretary of Commerce to succeed Wallace, who has resigned.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 23rd (broadcast): U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman issued a statement today, saying that the development of U.S. trade depends on the cooperation and peace of all countries in the world, and expressed absolute support for Truman and Byrnes' foreign policy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Mia, USA, 22nd] Railroad Employees Association Chairman Wednan told reporters today that the political ideas led by Senator Pepper and former Secretary of Commerce Wallace can get great assistance from labor. It does not matter whether it is called Pepper-Wallaceism or Wallace-Pepperism. Ninety-nine percent of railroad employees and the majority of all workers support this doctrine, and Miners Union Chairman Lewis will also provide assistance. Wade is not interested in organizing a third party because it has no hope of winning. What is needed now is to restore President Roosevelt's basic principles of freedom and progress.</p>
<h3>Iranian Rebels Seize Territory</h3>
<p>Government Decides on Strong Action</p>

<h3>Switzerland Resumes Relations with the Soviet Union; Reaffirms Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Zurich, 22nd] Swiss Foreign Minister Petitpierre recently delivered a speech to the Third Conference of Women's Delegates, discussing the arrival of Soviet diplomatic envoys in Switzerland. He said that the resumption of diplomatic relations between Switzerland and the Soviet Union is not a high point, but the beginning of a permanent friendship between the two countries. Our concepts of democracy and the relationship between individuals and the country are different, but we all want to know the way of life of the Soviet people. Regarding the agreement between Switzerland and the United States on German property, the uncertainty of Germany's future is one of the disturbing factors in the general political situation. The current international situation is quite serious. Large and small countries attack each other, and the words used are unprecedented in diplomacy, but I believe that the disputes will eventually be overcome. The world has high hopes for the UN Charter, but unfortunately it has failed to live up to the expectations of the world. Even the wartime industries of ten countries are still producing as usual, resulting in a very dangerous rumor that the so-called Third World War is inevitable. Fortunately, we still maintain an optimistic attitude and are not attacked by fear and deterioration. Regarding Switzerland's neutral position, the UN Charter will inevitably impose the obligations borne by UN member states on our country, but our country is in a neutral position, and it is difficult to fulfill them. Therefore, no one knows when Switzerland will be able to join the UN organization. However, there is also a possibility that it can be realized in the shortest possible time, and the site of the women's UN organization may use the old League of Nations site in Geneva.</p>
<h3>Bose is Not Dead!</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 23rd] According to reports received here, astonishing news may be released within weeks, announcing that Jiang Tela Bose, the founder of the "Indian National Army," has safely returned to somewhere in India. It is rumored that Bose's All-India Forward Bloc party is preparing to announce Bose's appearance before October. Bose is still admired by countless Indians. Now, the Indian interim government has announced the revocation of the arrest warrant for Bose. Therefore, if Bose is still alive and reappears, it would be permissible. According to reports, Bose's plane crash death was originally issued by a Japanese news agency last year. At that time, although the news agency published photos of the wreckage of the plane and the funeral, and passengers on the same plane described Bose's death, many people still believed that Bose had not died, but had hidden again as before, waiting for an opportunity to move again. This leader, who once had disputes with the highest authorities of the Congress Party, is expected to be second only to Gandhi in reputation and status if he reappears, because he built up the worship of Indians during the war.</p>

<h3>US Assists Japan in Restoring Industrial Economy; Japanese Cocoon Shipment to China Rejected; Textile Advisor of MacArthur Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd] MacArthur's headquarters textile advisor, Magana, today accused Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, and stated that he opposed the shipment of any silkworm cocoons to China. It is understood that the Chinese delegation to Japan had requested the shipment of 1.5 million pounds of Japanese silkworm cocoons to China, which was rejected by MacArthur's headquarters. They recently expressed dissatisfaction and indirectly accused American capitalists of attempting to seize Japan's silk industry, which aroused Magana's reaction. According to Magana, the main source of funds for the occupation forces paid by Japan comes from Japan's silk weaving industry, so the plan was not fulfilled. Chinese silk factories purchased a large batch of low-quality silkworm cocoons domestically earlier this year, believing that the silk made from these silkworm cocoons could be sold at high prices in the United States or international markets. The Chinese side attempted to obtain better-quality Japanese silkworm cocoons at a low price to offset the funds spent on purchasing silkworm cocoons in their own country earlier. Japan is in need of all its silkworm cocoons to maintain raw silk exports. Some Japanese silk factories are currently being urged to switch to producing cotton and rayon fabrics, which is also for this reason. Orders have now been given to the Japanese to expand mulberry fields to increase the amount of silkworm cocoons so that annual raw silk exports can reach 30 million pounds. Before the war, Japan exported 95 million pounds of raw silk annually. China currently has silkworm mercury that can produce 20,000 packages of raw silk annually, but China has not yet achieved this. The Chinese delegation's request to ship Japanese silkworm mercury to China came from a direct request from the Chinese silk company to the delegation. American merchants have never used the government to request MacArthur's headquarters to obtain Japanese export commodities for them. Any silkworm cocoons shipped to China will further harm Japan's economy. Therefore, shipping Japanese silkworm cocoons to China would violate the Potsdam Declaration and would not be in line with the purpose of occupying Japan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] The US government's assistance to Japan in restoring its industrial economy is proceeding steadily. This matter involves the cooperation of the State Department, the Army Department, and other government agencies to ensure that Japan quickly restores its economic position, at least to the point of self-sufficiency, and to pay for the United Nations occupation expenses with the help of experts. Japan's textile industry, cotton yarn industry, and rayon industry have all received strong assistance. The US government is purchasing all the raw silk that Japan can produce and will provide more assistance to its rayon industry to revive it. For several months, raw cotton has been continuously imported into Japan, and funds have been provided to purchase foreign goods that Japan urgently needs. However, Japan's re-entry into the cotton fabric export market has not been unanimously approved by the United Nations. In the Far East, India needs cotton fabrics, and Japanese yarn factories are willing to supply them. However, China, Britain, and other producers hope to restore their pre-war business. According to the views of the US authorities, despite opposition from all parties, large-scale assistance will continue to be provided to the Japanese textile industry.</p>
<p>Estimated Production Capacity of Japanese Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 21st] The US military government in the Japanese-occupied area recently announced in a report that an agreement has been established between the Japanese textile industry, Japanese banks, and the Ministry of Finance to establish a banking group to fund the activities of the cotton weaving industry. Before the war, Japan sold more than 3 million yards of cotton cloth in the world market annually. It is expected that Japan will resume exports by the end of this year, most of which will be cotton fabrics, raw silk, and cotton yarn spun from American cotton. The US government agency, Commodity Credit Corporation, will supply Japan with 890,000 bales of cotton this year, of which 185,384 bales have already been shipped. This cotton will all be woven into cotton fabric for export. Eighty percent of Japanese spindles were destroyed due to the war, which greatly reduced cotton cloth production, but it is expected that production capacity can be doubled by the end of 1947. The production of cotton yarn is limited due to the lack of coal and chemicals, but the production of yarn pulp has greatly increased. The production of raw silk this year is approximately 150 million yards, but only 30 million yards are prepared for export. Japanese silk industry exporters expect that within five years, Japan's raw silk exports can restore its leading position in the world market. It is reported that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are willing to encourage the revival of Japan's textile export industry for different reasons. The United States hopes that Japan will use textile exports to pay for imported food and occupation expenses; Britain needs Japan to supply cotton fabrics to British territories; and the Soviet Union hopes to obtain Japanese textiles under a barter system. Therefore, the Japanese textile industry has a prosperous outlook.</p>
<p>Direct Trade is Currently Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Pikelay, the head of the Economic Science Group of the Foreign Trade Department of MacArthur's headquarters, stated that the Japan Trade Promotion Association recently sent a letter to the Trade Bureau, advocating changing the procedures for Japan's import and export trade, and that manufacturers and countries in the Far East should implement barter trade, which may not be approved by MacArthur. The matter of a Japanese observation group going abroad to investigate the international market situation may not be allowed, and they may not even be allowed to freely exchange information on international market trends. MacArthur's headquarters is currently using the Japan Trade Bureau to monitor Japan's export trade and intends to continue monitoring it to benefit the Japanese economy and at the same time supply various scarce items to other parts of the world. According to Pikelay, Japanese merchants often mention direct trade, but the time is not yet ripe for Japan to manage international trade on its own. Headquarters is currently conducting personnel research and may eventually allow some commercial relations with various countries, but the time is still far away. Headquarters is currently implementing material exchanges with various countries.</p>
<h3>Japanese Upper House Passes Bill to Implement Social Welfare System</h3>
<p>A Historic Move for Japan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese Upper House passed the "Daily Life Security Law," stipulating the establishment of protection and relief associations in various cities to assist the unemployed, poor, sick, and maternity, distribute pensions, and carry out various other relief work.

The passage of this bill indicates that the Japanese government has assumed responsibility for social welfare.</p>
<h3>Japan Raised White Russian Spies to Plot the Assassination of Stalin; Far East Tribunal Reveals Truth About Axis Alliance</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: A shocking discovery was made in today's trial of Japanese war criminals. The US side presented Nazi secret documents, proving that the former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, had carried out a plot to assassinate Stalin without success. It is said that Oshima dispatched ten White Russian spies across the Caucasus border, carrying bombs, to plot to kill Stalin, but they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>[Gaejo Shinmun, Tokyo, 23rd] Prosecutors at the Far East International Tribunal today continued to present various documents to reveal the truth about Axis diplomacy. As a result of the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Japanese Ambassador to Italy Shiratori in 1939, Prime Minister Hiranuma approved the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, while Foreign Minister Arita was lukewarm. Shiratori greatly approved, but the result had many reservations, wanting to limit the alliance to an anti-Soviet alliance. Oshima and Shiratori refused to convey this Japanese instruction to Germany and Italy and hoped that Japan would fully accept the alliance plan. The German Ambassador to Japan, Walter, reported to his government that the Japanese Minister of the Army and Minister of Finance approved the alliance of the three countries, while the Minister of the Navy and the Minister of the Sea expressed opposition. The Army tried to establish the alliance, and if it failed, it would withdraw from the cabinet, while the Navy, led by Navy Vice Minister Yamamoto, expressed opposition. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty, negotiations on the alliance of the three countries should be stopped, and it was said that the non-aggression treaty countered the Anti-Comintern Pact, but Oshima did not lose the importance of the protest after the protest letter was handed over to the German government. In 1940, the German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, reported to his government that he had the assistance of Oshima, Shiratori, Terauchi, and Ishii, and the pro-German elements of the Army, who had temporarily retreated, were plotting to restore their power. He later telegraphed that although the Yonai cabinet was pro-British and American compromise, it was opposed by the Army and the people, so its policies could not be realized. He met with Konoe, Mitsui, and others to incite anti-American sentiment in Japan. He is currently working to reconcile Japan and the Soviet Union and hopes that Konoe will serve as Prime Minister.</p>

<h3>Korean Autonomous Government to be Established in March Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Korean Provisional Government delegation to China received a Korean broadcast stating that the US military government in Seoul announced that it will organize a Korean autonomous government in March next year. Currently, Korean people are organizing a legislative body to draft a charter and other matters in preparation for organizing the government. The Legislative Body Committee is jointly organized by 30 people appointed by the government and 30 people elected by the people. Once the work is completed, 30 people will be designated by the government for another popular election. After the establishment of the Korean autonomous government, the military government will be abolished, and an advisory group will be formed to assist it. Although the Soviet side has not participated in the organization of the Korean government, the US side is still working hard to consult with the Soviet side in order to realize the promise of Korean unification and complete independence.</p>

<h3>Modern "Tarzan" Grows Up Among Antelopes; Walks as Fast as the Wind; Does Not Understand Human Language; Makes Goat Sounds and Eats Grass</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bata, 22nd] The antelope man recently discovered in the outer Jordanian desert is now being carefully cared for by Gilbert of the Iraqi Oil Company. According to Gilbert, when this 15-year-old strange man was captured, he ran at a speed of 50 miles per hour, which is more than twice the world short-distance record of 100 yards. This modern "Tarzan" is thought to have been abandoned by his mother when he was young and adopted by a group of antelopes, gradually learning various characteristics of antelopes. I have studied him in detail and found that his actions, cries, and so on are all like domestic antelopes. He is only willing to eat grass and does not want to eat ordinary food. But I am sure that he is a human being, but he grew up among domestic antelopes. He almost lost his life when he was first discovered by hunters of antelopes. Fortunately, one person in the shadows saw a child in the flock of sheep and immediately greeted his companions not to shoot, and then drove a car to chase him, and the child ran at a speed of 50 miles per hour, and finally fell to the ground. According to the chief of the Ruhwala tribe, who first took care of the child, the child jumped on the roof on the first day in his home, and then jumped from one roof to another, and then jumped into the street. Finally, he dispatched vehicles and horses to chase him, and he was captured after more than two hours. When the child was first discovered, there were many rumors, some saying that he was half human and half goat. Now we know that the child is indeed human, but he is more robust than ordinary people. Of course, he cannot speak human language, he can only make antelope cries. It is said that he has recently become accustomed to human life. It is said that mothers of nomadic peoples in the Near East often abandon their children to herds of beasts, but most of them are eaten by beasts, and it is rare for them to be raised by beasts.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Middle East (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Pasil, translated by Wen Hao</p>
<p>On the international stage, the Middle East is about to show its skills again. Here, Britain and Russia are opposed to each other, the United States stands on the side of Britain, and Diego is also eager to step onto the stage. She has recently acted as a mediator several times. As for the people of the Middle East, not long ago, they were bought off and had no idea what was going on in the play. But now the situation is different. The representatives of the people, whether real or fake, often hold a considerable position on this stage. The key to the Middle East is in the hands of Britain and Russia. Britain is deeply afraid that Russia's encouragement of leftist elements in the Near East will threaten the lifeline of the British Empire. Conversely, Russia is deeply afraid that Britain will use reactionary forces to create a government to make things difficult for it.</p>
<p>Difficulties are brewing everywhere in the Middle East. The factors can be divided into three categories: Conflicts of interest between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union; In the past 30 years, a high degree of nationalism has deeply grasped Islam; Due to frequent contact with the West during World War II, a kind of social awakening was created, and this awakening was further accelerated by the socialism brought by Russia.</p>
<p>Since the birth of civilization, geography and history have bestowed the Middle East with supreme strategic importance because it is a bridge and a transverse road between many continents. It is a part of Asia and a necessary path for Westerners to come to the East. It contains the richest oil mines in the world and many other undeveloped resources. The three powers are very clear: Any country that controls the Middle East alone will eventually be able to control Asia and its 1.2 billion people, which is almost half of the world's population.</p>
<p>Turkey and the Straits</p>
<p>Gongguo is deeply afraid that Russia's influence will enter the Mediterranean Sea through the Tartar Neil Strait and the Persian Gulf through Iran. Britain believes that this intrusion is very unfavorable. In order to resist this intrusion, Britain often asks Russia to respect the territorial integrity of Turkey and Iran in the same way. With the support of the United States, Britain has gained greater trust from the conservative governments of Turkey and Iran. Conversely, Russia is also promoting that Britain and the United States are trying to control the politics and economy of the entire Middle East. Russia believes that it is not only excluded from the Middle East oil mines but also needs sea and air bases to resist the military encirclement formed by Britain there, which have been rejected everywhere. With the collapse of the French and Italian navies today, the Mediterranean Sea has become a British lake. The Soviet Union has been demanding its rights to the Tartar Neil Strait. If the Tartar Neil Strait falls into the hands of Russia, Britain will be unable to prevent the pro-Russian party in Greece from seizing power. Therefore, Turkey, like Greece, has formed a key to British foreign policy.</p>
<p>Iranian Incident</p>
<p>Iran also lies on the lifeline of the British Empire. Iran's coastline forms the entire eastern part of the Persian Gulf. Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia are located in its northern and western regions. As early as 1914, Kuwait became an independent sheikhdom under British protection, and the King of Saudi Arabia has maintained friendly relations with Britain since taking power. According to the exclusive agreement signed in March 1892, these sheikhdoms, their monarchs themselves, and their successors shall not enter into agreements or dealings with countries other than Britain, nor shall they accept ambassadors from any country other than Britain, nor shall they cede or sell any land to countries other than Britain.</p>
<p>Therefore, through these treaties, Britain has fully grasped the strategic advantage in the Persian Gulf. Any power that occupies a place in southern Iran can interfere with Britain's communication lines in the Arabian Sea. It can advance east and knock on the door of North India. The reason why Russian troops entered Iran after March 2 this year and Britain roared in the United Nations Security Council is here.</p>
<h3>City Government Budget Deficit Passes 2.21 Billion Yuan, Decides on Ways to Make Up the Difference, Imposes Municipal Construction Surtax, Assembly Postponed Again, Horse Racing Issue to be Discussed Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its 21st meeting yesterday morning. First, a memorial week was held, with Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivering a speech: The city government budget was discussed last Saturday and some resolutions have been made, but there is no final decision on the overall budget. Therefore, the budget decision should be made first on today's agenda. At the same time, it is hoped that in the morning meeting, the additional tax cases related to the budget will be discussed and decided based on the review reports, so as to make up for the budget deficit. If we only pass the budget without deciding on the remedies, the passed budget will still be nominal. Secondly, only half of the review reports of the various committees of this council have been discussed. If the agenda for postponement today (that is, yesterday) cannot be completed, the assembly may be postponed for one or two days. Finally, Mr. Pan hoped that all councilors could consistently adhere to the spirit of not being late and not asking for leave during this assembly, so as not to affect the meeting and to be responsible to the voters. According to Mr. Pan's report, the number of councilors attending the first few days of the assembly was more than 150, while later attendees were only about 110 to 120.</p>
<p>At the morning meeting, the Council discussed the tax cases submitted by the mayor. After discussion, it was resolved to cancel the additional defense corps uniform fees and epidemic prevention funds in the housing tax, reducing a total of 1.8 billion yuan. When incorporated into the budget revenue, the total revenue and expenditure deficit reached 22.1 billion yuan. As for the way to increase revenue, the entertainment tax was still raised to 50%, but the collection of sanitation tax was rejected. At the same time, the collection of additional tax on public utilities (excluding water tax) for half a year was approved, which can bring in 4 billion yuan. The housing tax is collected at 20% of the actual rent, to be borne by the landlord. In the afternoon, the meeting discussed who should bear the municipal surtax. The situation was quite heated, and it was decided that the municipal surtax should be borne by the residents according to the housing tax collection method.</p>
<p>The assembly finally passed the organizational regulations of various committees of the Municipal Council. Each committee shall have one chairman and two vice-chairmen, who shall be elected by the committee members. The chairman shall not concurrently serve as the director of the labor union. The term of office shall be three months and shall be re-elected after each assembly adjournment. Each councilor shall participate in at least one committee and at most two committees. Each committee shall meet once every two weeks, and the chairman shall convene extraordinary meetings when necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, as there were still many proposals to be discussed, the assembly decided to adjourn to today. Today's agenda will include discussion of social, educational, public works, regulations and "horse racing" issues, and the adoption of the assembly declaration.</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Deficit! How to Make Up for It</p>
<p>Two Focal Points of Discussion</p>
<p>The morning session continued to discuss the city's budget for the second half of the year, focusing on: (1) How much should the revenue and expenditure deficit be determined? (2) What new tax rules should be adopted to make up for this deficit?</p>
<p>Before determining the deficit number, several questions were raised regarding certain existing tax systems and city government revenue items:</p>
<p>Travelers Should Fulfill Tax Obligations</p>
<p>Wu Zhengjue first asked whether the inn tax of more than 200 million yuan listed in the budget was reasonable. Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, immediately explained that travelers to Shanghai enjoy the city's municipal facilities and should naturally fulfill a part of their tax obligations.</p>
<p>The speaker explained that the interim council had already decided to collect the inn tax last time, so there was no need to discuss it again. However, Jin Runxiang and others raised it again. The speaker put it to a vote, and only a very few people agreed to cancel it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xuelian asked whether the city government's income from the sale of materials, 4 billion yuan, and the income from various public utilities were included in the budget. Sun Yunfeng then asked whether the materials received by the city government's Materials Receiving and Management Office were also included in the budget. Regarding these points, the mayor immediately stood up to reply that more than 90% of the 4 billion yuan from the sale of materials had been used for civil servants' living subsidies in the first half of the year. As for public property, most of the property rights involved foreign affairs issues and were awaiting designation by the Executive Yuan's management committee to resolve. As for the received materials, they would be included in the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Office in the future, so they could not be included in the budget.</p>
<p>Canceling Housing Tax Surcharge Increases Budget Deficit</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo pointed out that the last assembly had resolved to cancel the defense corps uniform fee in the housing tax, but the entertainment tax also had this uniform fee, with a monthly income of 400 million yuan. If collection is stopped from September, the deficit will increase by 1.6 billion yuan. If the collected fees for July and August also have to be refunded, the increased deficit will be 2.4 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, Director Gu explained again that the defense corps uniform fee attached to the housing tax was listed separately under the "temporary receipts" account, but the one attached to the entertainment tax had never been separated and was always collected and disbursed together. If it is canceled, it will cause difficulties. In fact, the dispute over the entertainment tax is not about whether the uniform fee is attached to it, but about the percentage of the tax rate. The entertainment industry has repeatedly requested a reduction in the tax rate. What the Council needs to decide now is whether to maintain the current tax rate of 40% of the ticket price or to restore it to the previous 30%. However, in any case, the deficit increased due to the reduction in the tax rate will still have to be raised from the citizens, so instead of collecting it anyway, he believes that more should be collected from those who have the money to enjoy entertainment!</p>
<p>The speaker read out the central government's decree on banquets and entertainment tax, which stipulates that the entertainment tax shall not exceed 50% of the ticket price. Therefore, he said: "The current budget only lists 40% of the ticket price, which does not exceed the regulations. If it is reduced, it will cause the entire city to increase the burden, which is wrong! It should be borne by those who can afford to enjoy entertainment!" Yan Kuasheng suggested that the fine item in the budget could be increased by 300 million yuan, but Feng Youzhen opposed it. He believes that there must be violations before there are fines. If the prescribed amount is too high, there may be cases of abuse of fines in the future.</p>
<p>Deficit of 22.1 Billion Yuan Approved by 110 Votes</p>
<p>The discussion of details had taken up a lot of time. The speaker finally decided to put the fundamental principle, that is, the determination of the revenue and expenditure deficit, to a vote. The original budget compiled by the city government had a deficit of 33.3 billion yuan. After the review by the ninth subcommittee, the income was increased as it should be, and the expenditures were decreased as they should be. The approved income was more than 55.1 billion yuan, the expenditures were more than 75.4 billion yuan, and the deficit was 20.3 billion yuan. However, because the last assembly resolved to cancel the defense corps uniform fee and epidemic prevention funds attached to the housing tax, which totaled 1.8 billion yuan, the income was reduced and the deficit increased to 22.1 billion yuan. If this number is passed, it will be necessary to plan ways to increase revenue to make up for it. Do the councilors agree? The result of the vote was that 110 of the 119 people present raised their hands in favor, and the principle was passed.</p>
<p>Three Ways to Increase Revenue: Housing Tax to be Borne by Landlords, Entertainment Tax Raised to 50%, Additional Tax on Public Utilities Levied</p>
<p>After the deficit of 22.1 billion yuan was determined by vote, the assembly discussed how to increase revenue to make up for it. Among the five methods submitted by the mayor, except for the horse racing tax, which would be discussed separately, the review committees believed that the municipal surtax and the public utility surtax should be adopted.</p>
<p>According to the report of Lu Shidao, convener of the third subcommittee, the review process was based on three principles: (1) Do not make the citizens feel that there are excessive taxes, (2) The tax standard is proportional to wealth, (3) The collection is simple and there will be no leakage. After discussion, it was felt that raising the housing tax was easier for citizens to accept, but it clearly conflicted with central government regulations and might affect the increase in rent. The sanitation tax was too trivial. The public utility surtax was the fairest and most reasonable, and the collection was the easiest, but the amount was too small. Although the municipal surtax had cumbersome collection procedures, it was relatively in line with the principle of fairness, so it was initially decided to adopt the municipal surtax method. However, after the passage, someone in the subcommittee proposed a reconsideration. As a result of the reconsideration, although the original decision was maintained, the number of votes in favor and against differed by only one vote. Later, some private individuals suggested using the name of the municipal construction surtax, which included the 4 billion yuan of the public utility surtax, and the remaining deficit of more than 18 billion yuan would be collected by the Finance Bureau according to the current housing tax ratio by adjusting the tax rate.</p>
<p>After Mr. Lu finished his report, the councilors expressed their opinions and the discussion was very intense. The important points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the public utility surtax, some people believe that the water tax should not be collected because water is a necessity for any common people. Some people believe that the collection of electricity tax should take into account the situation of the industry, because factories use the most electricity, especially yarn factories, and the fees are also higher, so if you want to cultivate industry, the collection of electricity tax should be considered.</p>
<p>The Name is Not Correct and the Words are Not Reasonable</p>
<p>(2) The most important thing is the opposition to the name of the municipal surtax. Tong Xingbai believes that the municipal surtax is actually a property tax, which is collected according to the value of real estate, which is in line with the Three Principles of the People's policy of controlling capital. However, the name of the municipal surtax is too vague, and he advocated changing it to property tax. He said: "I hope that the taxes in the future will be concentrated on real estate and real property, and there is no need to scrape the common people's heads in bits and pieces!" But the speaker pointed out that the collection object of the municipal surtax is the residents, not the owners. Therefore, if you want to collect property tax, that is another matter and cannot be combined with the municipal surtax. Wang Jian'e proposed that in the past, during the era of the Public Works Bureau, the housing tax was called the municipal surtax. Now that there is a housing tax, if you collect the municipal surtax again, it will give the citizens a bad impression. He advocated changing the name to the municipal construction surtax. Many people who spoke up one after another believed that the name of the property tax was not true to its name and might cause an increase in rent, so it was better to use the municipal construction surtax.</p>
<p>(3) Chen Gongda also proposed another way to increase revenue. He believes that since the law stipulates that the entertainment tax can be up to 50%, and the current list is only 40%, it can be increased by another 10%, so that from October to the end of December, tax revenue can be increased by 800 million to 1 billion yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Xu Yongzuo proposed that since the defense corps uniform fee and epidemic prevention funds have been removed from the housing tax and the collection has been reduced, the burden method should be improved. It should be collected at 30% of the actual rent according to the central government regulations, and the landlord should bear it.</p>
<p>Passed Three Important Resolutions</p>
<p>After several tens of minutes of discussion, various opinions were summarized and put to a vote. Finally, three important resolutions were passed: First, the entertainment tax rate was raised to 50%. Second, the housing tax was changed to be collected at 20% of the actual rent, and the landlord should bear it. Third, an additional tax on public utilities was levied. The remaining deficit was made up by the city government in the name of the municipal construction surtax by adjusting the tax rate.</p>
<p>Finally, the meeting discussed the collection method of the municipal construction surtax. Should it be borne by the landlord? Or should it be borne by the tenant? Or should the landlord and tenant bear it together?</p>
<p>Opinions were clearly divided into three factions: One faction believed that the landlord should bear more of the burden. Their argument was that since the landlord has real estate, he is of course a rich class, and the rich should pay more taxes! One faction believes that the municipal construction surtax is in name and in fact for municipal construction. According to the principle of equal rights and obligations, it should be borne by the people who enjoy the benefits. Now that the housing tax has been decided to be borne by the landlord, the municipal construction surtax should be borne by the tenant. The compromise faction, which is in between these two factions, advocated setting a ratio for the landlord and tenant to bear fairly.</p>
<p>The debate was heated, and the meeting was extended to 12:45 pm without any results. Finally, Xi Yushu suggested that the concrete figures should be discussed in the afternoon before a decision is made.</p>
<h3>Those Who Attend the Assembly Are Not Responsible for Any External Statements, and a Statement is Made Regarding the Allocation of Temples</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Council passed the Minzi No. 3 Review Report resolution "Allocating or Borrowing Temples or Public Buildings" for use as district offices a few days ago, the Council has received many petitions from various temples and Buddhist associations.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Speaker Pan made two solemn statements at the assembly:</p>
<p>(1) According to Article 18 of the Council's Organizational Regulations, those who attend and attend the meeting are responsible to the Council for their speeches and are not responsible for any external statements.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Council's Minzi No. 3 Review Report resolution to allocate or borrow temples or public buildings for use as district offices, the so-called allocation was carefully considered at the time. Temples that belong to the local public or are publicly managed, and those that are currently abandoned, can be allocated. As for general temples, their consent should be obtained first and then borrowed. On the one hand, the property rights of the temples should be protected, and on the other hand, the district offices can solve all allocation or borrowing procedures. It is undoubtedly necessary to follow the provisions of the law.</p>
<h3>Citizens Report Temple Monks for Supporting the Enemy, Assembly Agrees to Transfer to the Court, A Statement is Made Regarding the Allocation of Temples</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shanghai merchants Xie Xiqing, Cai Jianquan, Lu Zhonghou, Zhou Yinquan, witnesses Chen Zhixin, Yao Shaoxiu, and Xu Honghan, have jointly reported De Wu, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, and the resident monk Mi Jia for the crime of colluding with the enemy, and have filed a complaint with the High Prosecutor's Office. Although the court has held two hearings, the defendants have been released on bail. It has been more than two months and there is still no news of prosecution. Yesterday, Ms. Yao Shaoxiu brought evidence (see picture) such as the recruitment of the Buddhist Tongming School run by the defendants to the Council, requesting justice to be upheld and a public decision to be made. Councilor Gong Fu received them and reported to the assembly, saying: Many citizens have listed three major crimes of the monks De Wu and Mi Jia of Jing'an Temple. The most obvious point is the enslavement education of founding the Tongming Japanese Language School. They have reported and accused the High Prosecutor's Office, but the main criminals are still at large. Therefore, they responded to the Council's deadline for reporting traitors and came to make a statement. After the assembly decided, the case was allowed to be transferred to the court for handling.</p>
<h3>Discussing Municipal Construction Surtax, Resolved to be Borne by Residents</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Council continued to discuss the issue of who should bear the municipal construction surtax. The councilors engaged in an unprecedentedly heated debate over whether it should be borne by the tenants or jointly by the landlords and tenants, and most of them used actual figures as a basis.</p>
<p>The final resolution passed was: "(1) The municipal construction surtax shall be collected in accordance with the method of the Father No. 2 proposal. Of the total amount, in addition to the housing tax collected at 20% of the actual rent, which shall be borne by the landlord, the remainder shall be stipulated as the donation rate for setting up the donation. It is divided into three grades according to the current value of the house: Grade A, with a current value of 100 million yuan or more, shall be charged a monthly donation of 3/1000. Grade B, with a current value of 50 million yuan or more but less than 100 million yuan, shall be charged a monthly donation of 2/1000. Grade C, with a current value of less than 50 million yuan, shall be charged a monthly donation of 1/1000.</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo Reports That Landlords Cannot Afford It</p>
<p>Based on the above donation rate, Xu Yongzuo has a numerical report. He used the rent of the 26th year as a standard and divided it into three grades, A, B, and C. He explained that if the municipal construction surtax is borne by the landlords, the landlords will suffer unbearable losses. Assuming that Grade A houses had a monthly rent of 500 yuan in the 26th year, calculated at the statutory 160 times, the current rent is 80,000 yuan. After deducting the 20% housing tax of 16,000 yuan, the net income is 64,000 yuan. The value of this type of house in the 26th year was 50,000 yuan. Calculated at 5,000 times, the current value is 250 million yuan. The municipal construction surtax of 3/1000 is 750,000 yuan. In addition to the net income of 64,000 yuan in rent, he will lose 686,000 yuan. Even if the landlord and tenant each bear half, he will still lose 311,000 yuan. For Grade B houses, assuming that the pre-war rent was 100 yuan and the current rent is 16,000 yuan, after deducting the 3,200 yuan housing tax, the net income is 12,800 yuan. The current value is 50 million yuan, and the municipal construction surtax of 2/1000 needs to be paid, which is 100,000 yuan, so he will lose 87,200 yuan. If the landlord and tenant bear the average, the landlord will also lose 27,200 yuan. For Grade C houses, assuming that the pre-war rent was 20 yuan and the current statutory rent is 3,200 yuan, after deducting the housing tax of 640 yuan, the net income is 2,560 yuan. The current value is about 10 million yuan, and the municipal construction surtax of 10,000 yuan should be paid, so he will lose 7,440 yuan. If the landlord and tenant bear the average, the landlord will also lose 2,440 yuan. Finally, Xu Yongzuo asked: "Is this method reasonable, is it possible? As a result, the landlord has to give up the house, because having a house not only does not make money, but also loses money. Who wants a house? In the autumn of such a serious housing shortage, it is also impossible in fact. Moreover, if the municipal construction surtax is paid by the landlord, it becomes a property tax, which is unreasonable. In name and in fact, it should be paid by those who enjoy municipal construction."</p>
<p>Speaker Pan's on Collection Methods</p>
<p>Speaker Pan discovered a very strange thing. He said: "At present, it is very difficult to assess the value of houses, and the appraisers of the Finance Bureau can manipulate the power, which inevitably leads to abuses. The municipal construction donations are collected according to the current value of the house. Councilor Xu Yongzuo has already provided a numerical explanation. I have also calculated it slightly. However, the result I have calculated is about higher than that of Councilor Xu. It is estimated that Grade C houses should pay a municipal construction donation of 12,000 yuan, Grade B should pay 120,000 yuan, and Grade A should pay 800,000 yuan. But there is one thing that is very strange. If the housing tax is paid according to the No. 2 method, the city government can collect 18 billion yuan in half a year, which is enough to make up for the budget deficit. But the burden on the tenants has been reduced. I don't know how the Finance Bureau assessed it, but this method is beneficial to the general people. We have already decided that the housing tax should be collected at 20% of the actual rent. Now we can adopt the method of No. 2, but not the housing tax, but the municipal construction surtax. According to the method of No. 2, this autumn, the housing tax for Grade A houses is three times higher than in summer, the housing tax for Grade B houses is two times higher than in summer, and the housing tax for Grade C houses is one time higher than in summer. Another loan will be added in winter. The so-called summer housing tax collection method is to collect 14% of the 560 times the rent in the 26th year. That is to say, for Grade C houses, the rent in the 26th year was 20 yuan, the summer housing tax is 1,512 yuan, the autumn is 3,024 yuan, and the winter is 6,048 yuan. In the autumn and winter seasons, the average is only more than 4,500 yuan, and the housing tax of 20% of the actual rent paid by the landlord can also be deducted. But according to the municipal construction surtax donation rate, drawing 1/1000 of the current value of the house means that if the tenant bears the average, he also has to pay a municipal construction surtax of 5,000 yuan. So, according to this method, tenants are cheaper. According to this method, for Grade B houses that rented for 100 yuan before the war, 22,680 yuan will be paid in autumn and 45,360 yuan will be paid in winter. But according to the municipal construction surtax donation rate, if the tenant bears half, he also has to pay 50,000 yuan. For Grade A houses that rented for 500 yuan before the war, 151,200 yuan will be paid in autumn and 302,400 yuan will be paid in winter. But according to the municipal construction surtax donation rate, if the tenant bears half, he also has to pay 375,000 yuan. Therefore, if the collection is carried out according to the method of No. 2, and the housing tax that the landlord should pay is deducted from the total amount, the tenant can get a lot cheaper. According to this number, no matter what grade of houses are, the money paid by the tenants is less than half of the municipal construction surtax drawn according to the current value of the house. Therefore, I suggest adopting this method." All the councilors applauded and agreed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Burden Issue: A Debate</p>
<p>Director Gu and Lu Shidao also gave explanations regarding the numerical statistics. What Director Gu explained was that after the housing tax is collected at 20% of the actual rent, the burden on the landlord depends on the rent he receives. The higher the rent, the higher the housing tax will be. What Lu Shidao explained was that it is unreasonable for the municipal construction surtax to be borne by the landlord.</p>
<p>Traditional first looked at it from a theoretical perspective. He said: "I don't calculate numbers, but we want to pursue the truth. To be honest, neither the landlord nor the tenant can afford the burden. What is being collected now is the municipal construction surtax. Whoever enjoys the municipal construction has to pay the donation. If the name is not correct, the words are not reasonable. We have to understand this point. As for the landlord, he will have to pay land value tax and land appreciation tax in the future, and that number will certainly be very large." Xi Yushu also spoke in pursuit of the truth, believing that the truth is that the municipal construction surtax should be borne by the tenant. Deputy Speaker Xu said: "Brothers are laborers but speak for capitalists. What the rich people have in their hands now is definitely not real estate, but gold bars, US dollars, cotton yarn and other goods. Taxes should be reasonable." The final conclusion was also that "the municipal construction surtax should be borne by those who enjoy municipal construction."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan once stood up and shouted, please the councilors, don't think too much about the landlord and forget the residents. You must know that the residents cannot afford it either. Wang Jian'e also insisted that the burden on the tenants should be taken into account.</p>
<p>Don't Forget the Sublessee</p>
<p>Regarding the estimation method of the current value of the house, Li Wenjie, Jin Runxiang, Tao Baichuan and others all expressed many opinions. Feng Youzhen reminded everyone not to forget the third type of people besides the landlord and the tenant: the sublessee. Because to the head landlord, he is a tenant; to the subtenant, he is a landlord, and he always has the upper hand and takes all the advantages. So we must never relax the sublessee.</p>
<p>The councilors argued endlessly. But in the end, Speaker Pan stood up and spoke, finally obtaining the approval of an absolute majority and resolving the motion.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau to Borrow One Billion Yuan to Order One Hundred Buses, to Arrive in Shanghai from the United States Next Spring</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the 45th Municipal Meeting approved the Public Works Bureau's borrowing of 2 billion yuan from the Bank of Communications to purchase new buses, the Public Works Bureau has been actively proceeding.

<h3>Night Soil Boats Compete for Business: Yang Qishan Accused, Court Opens Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The cleaning of night soil docks in the city was previously contracted to Wang Yongkang, who organized the Dakang Cleaning Company, during the enemy-puppet regime. Xu Yongquan was assigned to manage the Guanqiao dock (meaning night soil boats were assigned numbers for loading and were not allowed to jump the queue). After the victory, Wang was arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of being a traitor. Yang Qishan, a gang leader at the Nanshi dock, had many followers and was very influential. His disciples, Shen Baoyou and Gu Dabao, used Xu Yongquan's alleged unfair allocation of loading slots as an excuse to cause trouble. Shen Baoyou had been reported to the Penglai Road Gendarmerie by Xu Yongquan during the enemy-puppet period for being a guerrilla and was detained once. After the victory, Shen used this to obstruct Xu Yongquan and a conflict arose over the allocation of loading slots. Shen also accused Xu Yongquan of being a traitor to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Under pressure, Xu was forced to submit and became Yang Qishan's disciple, signing a settlement agreement with Shen Shiyou. Yang Qishan then obtained the right to allocate loading slots and jointly drafted handling regulations, which were registered with the Social Affairs Bureau but were not approved. The Jiangbei gang still competed for loading slots at the Guanqiao dock, leading to conflicts and fights with the Shanghai and Songjiang gangs. They attacked each other in the newspapers, causing much disturbance. After being reported, the police arrested them and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yang Qishan was prosecuted for obstructing the loading of night soil boats and directing his disciples Chen Zhixiang and Shen Baoyou to allocate loading slots, forcing boatmen to comply and obstructing the freedom of each night soil boat to load, thereby disrupting order and undermining social tranquility. The trial opened at the District Court yesterday afternoon. After an initial investigation, the court ordered a rescheduling for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Kefeng Returns Lost Item to Owner</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Qian Hongyuan, a 31-year-old engineer at the Central Paper Mill, residing at No. 9, Lane 316, Fuli Road, Ladou Road, hired a rickshaw at 5:00 PM on the 20th at Lafayette Road, Jin Shenfu Road, to go to the home of his friend Xi Fuquan at No. 61 Baisezhong Road. Upon arrival, he was in a hurry and forgot a briefcase containing a Chinese Bank cashier's check for 9.8 million national currency, US$320 in checks, a gold ring, and a Shanghai Bank passbook. He discovered the loss after entering the house and reported it to the Changshu Branch Bureau. Shortly after, the rickshaw puller found the briefcase on the way and quickly delivered it to Xi's residence, handing it over to Qian Hongyuan. His honesty is commendable.</p>
<h3>Sun Zuji Sentenced to Seven Years, Xia Qifeng to be Sentenced on the 30th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The High Court announced verdicts yesterday in two suspected traitor cases: Sun Zuji, who served as the puppet mayor of Hangzhou, the puppet finance director of Huaihai Province, and the puppet director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau, was sentenced to seven years in prison and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. Liu Zhenqun, a specialist in the Secretariat of the Puppet Central Political Committee, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison and two years of deprivation of civil rights.

<p>Xia Qifeng, a "three-dynasty veteran," was concluded yesterday by the High Court Collegial Panel and is scheduled to be sentenced on the 30th of this month. Xia, a native of Taixian, Jiangsu, is 59 years old this year. At the start of the War of Resistance, he betrayed the country and joined the puppet government, serving as the puppet Deputy Minister of the Interior in the Nanjing "Renovation Government." Later, the gang of traitors in North China organized the "Provisional Government" under the leadership of Wang Kemin, and Xia went to Ping to serve as the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Secretariat of the Puppet Government's Joint Committee. In September of the 28th year, he returned south to serve as the Puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs of the "Renovation Government." When the traitor Wang Jingwei organized the "National Government," he also served as the puppet Minister of Audit,兼伪中央执行委员及伪"大民会"常务理事. This association specialized in promoting pro-Japanese ideology and inciting the people to collaborate with the enemy.</p>
<p>Additionally, the traitorous cases of Hungarian Yili Zhi, who used gasoline and alcohol to aid the enemy, and Lin Zhixing, a translator for the enemy constitution, are also scheduled to be sentenced on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>Multiple cases were investigated on the same day: (1) Ke Puyang, the secretary of the White Russian Emigrant Friendship Association, was accused of colluding with Heimu, a representative of the enemy military department, to murder the association's two former anti-Japanese chairmen.

<h3>Enemy Nationals Attempt to Restrict Freedom of Speech: A Case Closely Watched by Chinese and Foreign Journalists: Trial of American Reporter Concluded, Lawyers on Both Sides Deliver Eloquent Arguments, Court Orders Sentencing on the 27th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The District Court continued the trial of the case in which German Nazi suspect Shen Ke sued Rundall, the director of the Shanghai office of the American United Press, for defamation at 3:00 PM yesterday. The audience was packed, with Americans making up nearly half of it. Shen Ke did not appear and was represented by his agent, lawyer Yao Zhaodi. Rundall was defended by lawyer Chen Tingrui. The lawyers on both sides engaged in a fierce debate. At 4:30 PM, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 27th. According to Mr. Chen Tingrui, although the court has scheduled sentencing, it does not necessarily mean that it will accept the case.</p>
<p>The trial began in an extremely tense atmosphere. When Rundall stepped into the defendant's box, he appeared slightly uneasy. Yuan Lunren, a reporter from the United Press, stood beside him, translating everyone's statements in a very low voice. Lawyer Yao first stated to the court that Shen Ke could not attend because he was detained in the guardhouse of the American Military Court. The court then approved Yao's representation.</p>
<p>From the Perspective of International Law, Shen Ke Has No Right to Sue</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen Tingrui then stood up and defended Rundall in a slow but forceful tone. He said: "According to the law, the court should not accept cases that are prosecuted without a self-accusation. Shen Ke is not allowed to file a self-accusation based on international law and the law of the Republic of China. According to international law, Shen Ke is a German national and a well-known Nazi member, listed on our country's list of those to be sent back to Germany, and is still detained in the American Military Court for war crimes. China and Germany have not yet made peace and are still legally at war. Therefore, the plaintiff's identity is that of an enemy national. Whether enemy nationals have the right to sue is not explicitly stipulated in our country's laws. However, international law is a law commonly recognized by international society, so international law should be regarded as part of the laws of each country. According to the provisions of international law after World War I, there is a relative recognition of the right of enemy nationals to sue. The United Kingdom and the United States recognize the right of enemy nationals to sue, but there is a prerequisite, that is, the enemy national must continue to reside in the host country and be a law-abiding citizen, allowed to reside by the local government. Shen Ke has not been allowed by our government to continue to reside in China. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a letter proving that 'Shen Ke is one of the German nationals on the list to be sent back to Germany and has been detained for suspected war crimes.' Mr. Chen presented the letter and continued, saying, 'This proves that Shen Ke is definitely not welcomed or allowed to reside in our country by the government. Moreover, Shen Ke is not only a Nazi member, but also a spy among the Nazis! Therefore, from the perspective of international law, Shen Ke has no right to sue.'"</p>
<p>According to the Provisional Constitution, Please Do Not Accept the Case</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding our country's Provisional Constitution, according to Article 15 of Chapter 2 of the Provisional Constitution, the people have the freedom of speech and publication. Our government has also repeatedly proclaimed freedom of speech as a political program. The defendant is the director of the China office of the American United Press. As a journalist, his freedom of speech should be even more strictly protected by law. Articles 19 and 7 of the Publication Law have provisions for this. Journalists report news with the aim of recording everything they hear. Today, the plaintiff, as a Nazi enemy national, attempts to restrict the freedom of friendly people and sue the court, which is insane! It must be known that Nazi law can prohibit the people's freedom of speech, but Nazi law cannot be applied in democratic China! This case is not only related to journalists and publishers from friendly countries in China, but also of great importance to domestic journalists and publishers. The court should not accept it.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen then quoted the writings of international law authority Oppenheim, stating that enemy nationals cannot file lawsuits nor appear in court for defense. He also quoted Noyes, saying that the protection of foreigners should be limited to those who are law-abiding and continue to reside. He also said that this case has attracted international attention. The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published a dispatch from New York saying that the verdict of this case will greatly affect whether foreign journalists have the opportunity to have freedom of speech in China. For the sake of maintaining freedom of speech, the Chinese government should not accept this case, etc. It is said that today, representing the defendant, based on international law and the law, he requests the court to issue a ruling not to accept the case.</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Agent States: Private Rights Should Be Protected Regardless of Victory or Defeat</p>
<p>Shen Ke's agent, lawyer Yao Zhaodi, then stood up and replied, stating: "The defendant's lawyer's defense is based on international law and the law. Now, let us first respond to the law aspect. The law does stipulate freedom of speech, but this freedom should have considerable restrictions, otherwise the chapter on defamation in the criminal law could be abolished. Therefore, the so-called freedom should be freedom within the scope of the law. Whether the defendant has exceeded the freedom of speech stipulated by the law, please investigate and make a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Secondly, regarding international law, in feudal times, when wars occurred, the defeated had no other way but to become slaves. However, it should be known that this kind of concept is a concept of feudal times. The books presented by the defendant's lawyer have not been read by this seat. Whether they are out of context cannot be said, but at most, they are just one person's opinion and cannot be taken as evidence. Regardless of victory or defeat, the private rights of the people should be protected. In 1907, various countries signed an international convention in The Hague, with countries such as China, the United States, and Germany signing on it. Among them, Article 23, Paragraph 8 of Chapter 4 clearly stipulates that it is specifically prohibited to eliminate the right of the people of the defeated country to sue, etc. Because people cannot live without their rights and cannot be without the protection of the law. To give an example, rape cases are those that can only be prosecuted if the victim is a German national, and if they are not allowed to sue, then this case will not be established!"</p>
<p>The defendant's actions have actually exceeded the scope that a journalist should adhere to. The source of the news he released is unclear, and there are many exaggerations. His actions have harmed our country's public order. After this case occurred, Rundall even appealed to the US State Department, intending to use the political power of his own country to coerce our government! Please, the court, consider the case, consider the facts, be calm and peaceful, and discuss the case on the merits.</p>
<p>Shen Ke's being sent back to his country is a "general" evacuation of foreigners. Those who are sent away are not necessarily bad elements. Our government is only afraid that they will not be able to maintain their lives after staying in China, so they are ordering them back to their country. Therefore, the point that the defendant's lawyer says that those who are sent away are the scum is not worth adopting. Although Shen Ke has now been prosecuted, he has not yet been convicted. The crimes charged by the American Military Court are only spying on military intelligence, which is actually without any factual basis. They actually want to fabricate crimes and deliberately create a big prison!"</p>
<p>At this time, Lawyer Chen angrily stood up and said that the prosecution of this case is illegal, and the defendant's side does not want to follow this illegal path and discuss the substance of this case.</p>
<p>There are Three So-Called Pieces of Evidence</p>
<p>However, despite this attack, Lawyer Yao continued his statement, saying that the defendant could not prove that the facts he defamed were true and reliable, and the plaintiff's side could prove that Rundall's words were not facts at all. There are three pieces of evidence: (1) Ambassador Chen Jie has a letter proving that Shen Ke's actions have always been beneficial to China. (2) Shen Ke left Chongqing on July 11, 1941, via Hanoi to Shanghai, which can be proven by the endorsements on his passport. When he left Chongqing, China had not yet declared war on Germany, but Rundall now says that his departure from Chongqing was to sabotage our country's underground work, which is clearly fabricated. (3) After Shen Ke returned to Shanghai, he often interacted with important people in charge of our country's underground work. Wu Shaoshu has a letter proving that he and Shen Ke often met due to the introduction of the person in charge of the Organization Department and called Shen Ke a loyal friend of China. When he was in Chongqing, he often praised our country's resistance to Japan in his reports and revealed that Germany had pro-Japanese tendencies. Wu's certificate also stated, "We often meet, but there is no mutual utilization or exchange of information." He also said, "I have always trusted Shen Ke without any doubt, so I often meet with him," and later stated, "My acquaintance with Shen Ke and the relationship that developed afterward have all been reported to the Organization Department for the record." It can be seen that what Rundall wrote is pure fabrication.</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen then rose again to reply, in addition to reiterating that Shen Ke's self-accusation was illegal, and said: "The Nazis have long since abandoned international law and treaties. The agent for the self-accusation considers Oppenheim's writings to be 'one person's opinion,' but no matter how brilliant the agent's research on international law is, it is probably not as good as this authority. There are different theories on the degree of binding of the Hague Convention. Whether it is applicable should be determined by each country's government. Taking the United Kingdom and Germany as an example, they have long expressed that they do not recognize it. The binding of treaties should be based on reciprocal treatment. Germany itself has already stopped applying it, so why seek public protection now?"</p>
<p>Why Not Attend? Why Detention?</p>
<p>As for the statement that the defendant attempted to use political power to coerce China, that is even more ridiculous! It concerns the international problem between the three countries of China, the United States, and Germany. The defendant is not wrong to observe his own government and has not attempted to use political power at all! The plaintiff should know that he has a guilty conscience, because he actually wants to use the power of the Chinese court's verdict to try to overturn the evidence presented by the American Military Court.</p>
<p>The agent for the self-accusation says that enemy nationals who are sent back are not necessarily bad guys, which also lacks common sense. The Chinese government's evacuation of enemy nationals does not have a fixed standard. Those evacuated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are Nazi elements, spies, and hooligans. If the two thousand German foreigners who were left in China were to sue here today, this lawyer would not object. Also, let me ask whether the overseas Chinese in Germany sued Germany during the war between China and Germany? Only if you can prove that you have the right to sue can you talk about reciprocity. Moreover, the release of this news was not limited to the United Press. The Associated Press has it, as well as the Shen Bao and the Xin Wen Bao. The source of the news is actually the press conference of the American military headquarters. Finally, there is one more point: According to our country's criminal procedure law, if the self-accuser does not attend after being summoned without a valid reason, the case should not be accepted. The self-accuser in this case has been summoned twice. Why didn't he attend? If it is said that it is because he is being detained, then why is he being detained? Can this be considered a valid reason? Please consider this, Court."</p>
<p>Rundall then began to speak after standing for an hour and a half, saying that he completely agreed with his defender's argument and did not want to prove whether Shen Ke was a spy today. The source of his report was the US military, and the agent for the self-accusation today seems to want me to prove whether the words of the US military authorities are accurate.</p>
<p>At 4:30, the court declared the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 27th.</p>
<h3>American Officer Suspected of Smuggling: Large Quantity of Luxury Goods Intercepted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A large number of smuggled goods from the United States arrived in Shanghai several months ago and were sold throughout the city. Lieutenant Warner of the US Navy was under suspicion, and the US Navy authorities sent personnel to monitor him and appointed Lieutenant Asar to be responsible for the search. However, Warner secretly wrote to the famous American lawyer Roger, entrusting him to handle unfinished matters. Roger loaded more than ten letters related to smuggling and eleven packages containing a large number of luxury goods such as rayon stockings, lipsticks, and perfumes into a car the other day. While transporting them through the Bund, Li Tingzhu, a bailiff from the District Prosecutor's Office, suddenly appeared and presented a search warrant. At the same time, the police, customs, and other agencies also sent personnel to the scene and detained all the untaxed luxury goods and escorted them back for investigation.</p>
<h3>Electric Heaters Banned This Winter to Reduce Electricity Load</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Winter is coming soon. In addition to actively preparing winter clothing, you must also be thinking about how to keep your bedroom and living room warm in the cold. Undoubtedly, installing an electric heater is the most ideal, economical, and convenient. However, this year is different from previous years. The electricity demand in the city has already exceeded the electricity production. Electricity for factories is still being cut off in shifts, let alone the extravagant electric heating. In order to maintain normal power supply, Mayor Wu has decided not to allow electric heaters this year. The power company will dismantle the electric heating devices of users throughout the city. Direct supply of current to electric stoves will remain the same. If the Shanghai Electric Power Company removes the extra burden of electric heaters, then electricity for lighting and electric stoves (limited to those formally equipped with electric stove meters) can be supplied adequately, and there is no need to worry about the power problem in winter.</p>
<h3>Sun Tianchang's Support for the Enemy Case: The High Prosecutor's Office Opens Investigation Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the Sun Tianchang case of supporting the enemy with Korean weapons was transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office, the office opened a hearing yesterday to investigate, summoning the informants Han Kaiyuan, Zhou Ganfu, Zhou Rongqing, and the defendant himself, who is in custody.</p>
<h3>Broad Daylight Robbery in the Downtown Area: Daring to Resist Arrest and Open Fire: Asia Money Exchange Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday was the first anniversary of the opening of the Asia Money Exchange at No. 818 North Sichuan Road. Business was booming due to the sharp rise in gold and US dollars in recent days. Suddenly, at 1:00 PM, a robber dressed in a navy blue suit, carrying a briefcase, claimed that he wanted to buy a large gold bar. A clerk invited him to the inner room. While looking at the goods, the robber opened the briefcase, pulled out two automatic weapons, and forced all personnel not to make a sound. At that time, five other robbers, each armed with guns, followed in. One robber acted as a lookout, sitting on the counter outside the room, pretending to be a staff member. One robber guarded the back door, one robbed, and two guarded the clerks. While the robbery was in progress, a Russian man came to sell US dollars and was driven into the inner room by the lookout, who ordered the Russian man to "sit down" in English. The robbers looted more than one hundred taels of gold, more than eight million in cash, and two thousand five hundred US dollars, putting them all into a travel bag. At the time, the lookout was heard shouting, "The wind is coming!" and they fled north through the front door. During the robbery, a Zhou surname employee of the exchange took the opportunity to slip out through the back door and reported to the nearby police. When the robbers carried the stolen goods out of the store, the police shot at them. The robbers also returned fire and resisted arrest. Because the location was crowded, the robbers were able to escape. After learning of the incident, Director Xuan ordered the Hongkou Police Branch to solve the case as soon as possible, since the robbers dared to rob in broad daylight.</p>
<h3>Breakthrough in Air Trafficking Case Involving Twists and Turns; Large Scale; Agencies Established in Major Cities Including Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Taiwan; Thirteen Men and Women to Be Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The air trafficking case recently cracked in this city has resulted in the arrest of over twenty suspects. After several days of investigation by the police bureau, apart from a portion who were released on bail due to insufficient evidence, the remaining thirteen suspects (including one female) have all been interrogated. Today, they will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office along with confiscated morphine gold bars valued at approximately one hundred million yuan, and specially made suitcases with hidden compartments used for drug transportation. The case's breakthrough involved many twists and turns. The Criminal Police Division of the Police Bureau mobilized officers from the Second Section, working day and night to pursue clues, even expanding the police network to Beiping, Tianjin, Taiwan, and other places. Ultimately, all suspects were apprehended.</p>
<p>The incident began on the 10th of this month when Director Xuan received a confidential report stating that a major drug trafficker, Song Zhi'an, residing at No. 32, Hehefang, Lin Sen Middle Road, had recently entrusted a large sum of money to the Xinhua Bank in this city for remittance to Tianjin. This money was said to be used for purchasing and transporting morphine. Director Xuan immediately instructed Chief Zhang of the Criminal Division that night to dispatch officers for investigation. After Chief Zhang discussed the matter with Section Chief of the Second Section, he immediately dispatched officers Feng Qishan and clerk Li Xiqing to Hehefang for investigation that night. Unexpectedly, the location turned out to be an empty house, and the homeowner, Zhu Qishan, had also escaped when arrested by the District Prosecutor's Office in a drug trafficking case ten days earlier. As the situation seemed suspicious, Feng and others conducted a search and obtained a house contract for Zhu Qishan, showing that he had taken over a house at No. 10, Pan Neng Street. They followed up on the investigation and, by the afternoon of the 11th, learned of Zhu Qishan's hidden address. They then led police officers Zhang Yunming, Ding Zhaogan, Gao Fuhai, Ding Wenjiang, and others to Room 12, No. 4, Kunshan Garden, where they arrested Zhu in a suite. Two pounds of caffeine and half a washbasin of black drug material were confiscated on the spot. During the search, a Taiwanese man named Sun Zhicheng arrived, carrying four gold bars weighing 39 taels, 5 mace, and 4 fen, intending to purchase morphine. He was immediately detained, and officers were dispatched to his residence at No. 9, Jishan Lane, Wuchang Road, where three pounds and two taels of morphine raw material and a pistol were confiscated. At that time, a well-dressed, robust man from Hebei arrived with an officer. The officer carried a suitcase. Upon entering the room and realizing the unusual situation, he attempted to flee, but was stopped by the officers. After questioning, one was identified as Zhang Mingyuan, 32 years old, and the other claimed to be Yan Dongfu, 37 years old, an upper-colonel officer of the 94th Army, claiming to have arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. When the officers asked them to produce identification, they hesitated, confirming that they were impersonating officers. The suitcase was opened and searched, revealing three pounds and five taels of morphine raw material in the hidden compartment of the suitcase. At this point, in addition to taking all the above-mentioned suspects to the bureau, officers were stationed at the location day and night. Simultaneously, the Hongkou Police Branch also received a confidential report and arrested five accomplices in the case at No. 54, Yifuli, Baoshan Road, and Room 311 of the Royal Hotel, including Taiwanese nationals Li Hongying, Zhang Gentian, Zhang Yiren, Li Dingguo, and Zhang Li Bingkun (female). Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Later, during the investigation, the police bureau learned that the main agency of the case was located in Beiping, Tianjin, Taiwan, and other places, and the key person in charge was Song Zhi'an. A telegram was sent to the Tianjin Police Bureau for assistance, and he was arrested on the 15th of this month. In Shanghai, four more suspects, Zhou Da, Ma Baiwu, Lü Xinquan, and Song Zixin, were successively arrested, and three specially made suitcases with hidden compartments, thirty-five rubber sheaths for concealing morphine, payment slips for drug trafficking profits, and drafts of round-trip telegrams were confiscated. A Northeast Advance Army identification card and a Northeast Advance Army military certificate were also found at Zhou Da's residence.</p>

<h3>Two Major Cases in Beiping Education and Culture; Fu Sinian Presents Separate Opinions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Beiping on the 23rd] Before Fu Sinian was about to leave Beiping and return south after completing his mission as the "Forward Command Post of Peking University," two major events involving Fu were published in the newspaper: (1) Fu Sinian strongly disagreed with the verdict of the Hebei High Court that acquitted Bao Jianqing, the puppet Peking University president. He cited four counts against Bao as reasons, including Bao leading students to Japan for internships and publishing articles such as "A Brief Discussion of Our Determination in the Greater East Asia War," and filed for retrial. The prosecutor has already filed for retrial. (2) Su Ting, a member of the investigation team, accused the Dagong Bao and Beiping Yishibao newspapers of not publishing news released by the team regarding Shen Jianshi, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education, and his subordinates' malfeasance in taking over ancient books and paintings from the Japanese, Kogani Yoshiaki. Fu Sinian sent a letter to the investigation team, believing that Su Ting should not have made this accusation before confirming that Shen Jianshi was at fault.</p>
<h3>Do Not Hope to Use the Blood and Sweat of Countless Citizens to Adorn Unnecessary Educational Facades</h3>
<p>City Councilors Shen Ding and Others Propose Abolishing Art Normal Schools, etc.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] City councilors Shen Ding, Jiang Huaishu, Lu YinChu, He Yuanming, etc., will present a temporary motion on the last day of the postponed City Council meeting today (the 24th), proposing that the City Government order the City Education Bureau to promptly adjust subordinate institutions, save expenditures, and popularize national education. Their reasons are as follows: The City Education Bureau's policy report to the Provisional City Council and the City Government's proposed work plan (education section) for the 35th year both mention increasing vocational schools, but in practice, there has been no active preparation. However, institutions not included in the plan, such as Art Normal Schools, suddenly opened, which shows that the Education Bureau's so-called plan is nothing more than a paper document. Therefore, institutions that have already been established, such as the Experimental Drama School and various centers, may not necessarily consider their value to education in the current stage of the city. What the citizens directly feel as an urgent need is that there are too few municipal primary and secondary schools, and children do not have suitable places to study. The citizens do not hope that the city government will use the blood and sweat of countless people to decorate unnecessary educational facades. Therefore, several measures are proposed as follows, and public decision is requested: Measures (1) The Experimental Drama School, the Experimental Public School, etc., should be abolished immediately, and the remaining school buildings should be converted into national schools. (2) The Municipal Art Normal School should be abolished immediately, and the specialized normal school should be merged with other normal schools. (3) The Music Center, the Art Center, the Craft Center, and the Science Experimental Sub-Center should be entrusted to schools, institutions, and groups to be jointly operated, or abolished directly. They should not be independent institutions. (4) Other matters that should be delayed or can be merged should be investigated and merged separately. (5) All expenditures saved due to the abolishment and merger of unnecessary institutions should be used entirely to develop national education.</p>
<h3>US Cultural and Educational Cooperation Council Meeting in Washington</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Technical College Opened Yesterday; Yan Huiqing Personally Delivered Training</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial College, sponsored by the Shanghai Yarn Mill Association, opened yesterday (the 23rd), with more than 300 faculty, staff and students attending. Chairman of the school board, Dr. Yan Huiqing, personally delivered a speech, saying that there are now many students and few schools, and many young people are often confused and anxious, with no schools to enter. The students are fortunate to come to the school, so they must not give up. He added that he had seen the stable and comfortable lives of foreigners abroad, and looking back at the suffering of Chinese people, the low standard of living was tragic. To save the situation, we should start with developing industry, and the responsibility lies with you. He hoped that everyone would work hard. Subsequently, school board members Jiang Weiqiao, Tang Xinghai, Liu Piji and others gave speeches in succession, with many words of encouragement, moving the entire audience. Finally, the President Zhou Chengyou introduced many new teachers, all of whom are well-known figures in the country. It is said that the school, in view of the difficulty for young people to enter schools this year, will hold another entrance exam early next month to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Teachers' Reading Club</h3>
<p>To be established within this month</p>
<p>The Shanghai First National Education Demonstration District, after the last principals' meeting decided to pass the organization of the Teachers' Reading Club and the student subject competition methods, reconvened the heads of teaching affairs of various schools at the office at 2:00 PM on the 22nd to review the organization of the Teachers' Reading Club in each school.

Teaching research problems can be raised and discussed in the reading club. At the meeting that day, specific decisions were made on the books to be read and the reporting methods. The office will prepare a list of books for teaching and distribute them to the schools. It is heard that schools have actively purchased books for teachers to read, and colleagues in the demonstration district have also taken the lead in promoting reading competitions and will send representatives to attend reading clubs in various schools to add interest. The promotion of this research atmosphere will surely benefit the improvement of teaching in various schools.</p>

<h3>President Zhu Summoned Representatives of Dismissed Professors of Jinan University; Promised to Inquire and Take Fair and Reasonable Action</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Shouyong, the new president of the National Jinan University, only renewed the contracts of 50 of the more than 150 restored faculty and staff, and 40 of the 64 professors were dismissed, which aroused the public anger of the dismissed professors. They jointly wrote a letter appealing to the government. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, was very concerned about this matter and took the opportunity to come to Shanghai to summon Yu Jianhua, Zou Youhua, Huang Yuanfang and other representatives of the dismissed professors of the university at the Academia Sinica yesterday (the 23rd) morning and inquired about the situation. In addition to submitting reports and relevant materials, the representatives detailed the hardships that Jinan University had endured during the relocation period, and that they were dismissed after the restoration. They also listed various improper actions of President Li Shouyong, and finally stated that although this matter belongs to the personnel problems of one school, it has a significant impact on the school system, professor security, teaching efficiency, and public morals. Minister Zhu greatly appreciated what the representatives stated, and promised to inquire with President Li and take fair and reasonable action.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Tactics Displayed Perfectly; Qunsheng Beats Dongfang Team Again</h3>
<p>60 to 38, Almost Double the Score; Qunsheng Three Wins in Three Games, Veteran Submits</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Qunsheng Basketball Team played its third game against the Dongfang Team in Shanghai yesterday. Dongfang, with its disorganized crowd and lack of connection, fought hard, but Qunsheng made full use of its exquisite tactics. The Dongfang veterans were helpless, and as a result, Qunsheng won again by a large margin of 60 to 38. The first half was 30 to 20. With yesterday's call from Dongfang, the gymnasium was packed, far exceeding the previous two games, which was the first grand occasion for the visiting team in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Incredibly Wonderful</p>
<p>Qunsheng's performance yesterday was even better than the previous two games. Chen Jinde planned from the middle, using shielding methods. The two forwards were like butterflies flitting through flowers, competing beautifully in the high and low posts, which was truly wonderful. Cai Wenhua and Cai Wenzhang's ease and accuracy in shooting the basket were delightful, and the teamwork during the entire team's attack and the speed of the defense can be said to be fully displayed. No wonder Dongfang bowed its head and submitted. The team's spirit was also admirable. Yesterday, there were occasional performances of dissatisfaction with the referee. I hope that those who do will change it, and those who do not will work harder.</p>
<p>Taking the Lead from Beginning to End</p>
<p>The game started on time, with Qunsheng sending Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Chen Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui into the game. Dongfang sent Ren Xiangcheng, Tang Baokun, Qin Xunze, Wang Nanzhen, and Liu Jingxing into the game. After the start of the game, Qunsheng's Cai Wenhua scored twice, first scoring two goals. Dongfang fought hard, and Liu Jingxing and Qin Xunze chased to 4 points each, then to 6 points each. After that, it was seen that Qunsheng used high-speed fast breaks, so the score gradually took the lead, and Dongfang followed the situation. The first half was 30 to 20, and Qunsheng won by 10 points.</p>
<p>In the second half, both sides made adjustments. Qunsheng replaced Cai Wenzhang with Cai Lianke, and Dongfang replaced Liu Jingxing with Zhang Shaoqing. Ren Xiangcheng scored first, but it was a flash in the pan. Qunsheng showed its power again, and Cai Wenhua's accurate shooting and follow-up under the basket gradually increased the score to 46 to 23. Dongfang frequently adjusted its new forces to respond to the enemy and used force to defeat the enemy. Qunsheng called up Zhang Yuyi and others. Dongfang tried to catch up and once made it 45 to 34. Qunsheng urgently used the ideal lineup, and the difference was seen again. Later, Yang Renhui committed five fouls, but before long, the whistle blew, and Qunsheng won with a score of 60 to 38, three wins in three games.</p>
<p>Qunsheng Foul Points</p>

<h3>Eighth District Work Review Meeting</h3>

During the meeting, it was proposed that there have been cases in the city where unscrupulous individuals have impersonated government agencies to spread rumors and defraud citizens. In the future, when the office dispatches field workers, it should issue field work permits to facilitate identification and prevent impersonation. District Chief Cheng considered this a matter of utmost importance and immediately instructed that a format be drafted, implemented immediately, and instructed all Bao and Jia leaders to inform all residents.</p>
<h3>Notes on Completing the Household Reregistration Form (Continued)</h3>
<p>Family members who specialize in household chores are classified as unemployed according to regulations. However, general surveys often list them as "personnel services." "Personnel services" refer to household management, servants, and hired labor that receive direct compensation. Managing one's own household cannot be confused with personnel services that receive direct compensation. For the sake of distinction, those who manage their own household should fill in "managing household affairs" to distinguish them from "personnel services" that receive compensation.</p>
<p>The categories of occupations are as follows: Concise Table of Occupational Classification Industry (1) Agriculture, (Explanation) All those engaged in the production of agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, hunting, and logging belong to this category.

<h3>Refutation of Rumors of Foreign Exchange Readjustment The President of the Central Bank States that He Has Heard Nothing of the Sort Efforts are Being Made to Curb Capital Flight to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, told reporters of this newspaper yesterday: The rumors circulating in the market that foreign exchange will be readjusted again are purely unfounded. Regarding the rumors circulating in the capital that the relevant parties have drafted a foreign exchange adjustment method and plan to make frequent adjustments with small ratios, he said that he had not heard of anything of the sort. He also did not know what "relevant parties" the rumors were referring to. He said: In short, all the recent rumors in the market about foreign exchange are completely groundless. He did not want to comment too much in the newspaper, so as not to be used by speculators as material for selective interpretation.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of capital flight to Hong Kong, he said that efforts are being made to find ways to control it. He ultimately hopes that the people can abide by the law more, which would be of great help.</p>
<p>The Central Bank will hold an administrative affairs meeting in the capital on Double Ten Day. He said: The meeting has not been held for a long time due to the impact of the war. Branches from all over the country will send personnel to participate in this meeting to pool ideas, exchange opinions, and study how to improve business operations so that the Central Bank can become the bank of banks. At the same time, they will discuss how to communicate the business of the head office and branches, as well as domestic exchange issues.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Stipulates Measures for Deferred Foreign Exchange Delivery</h3>
<p>In view of the recent large number of merchants applying to designated banks to defer the delivery of foreign exchange sold on a forward basis, the Central Bank yesterday sent a circular to all designated banks, detailing the following regulations regarding applications for deferred foreign exchange delivery:</p>
<p>(1) Merchants requesting to purchase foreign exchange, with the exception of those specified in Item 3, must have written documents proving the purpose of the foreign exchange purchased, and such documents must be approved by the designated bank. Designated banks should pay close attention to their own responsibilities when reviewing the above applications.</p>
<p>(2) For imported goods, with the exception of those specified in Items 3 and 4, there must be an irrevocable letter of credit or purchase order (Irrevocable L/C or A/P) guaranteeing payment, unless otherwise authorized by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(3) The above regulations may be separately negotiated for long-established importers with established payment practices, and the required amount may be approved and allocated on a regular basis according to their needs.</p>
<p>(4) For import drafts collected by banks exceeding US$500 C.I.F. or its equivalent, designated banks must obtain the prior permission of the Central Bank before selling the foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(5) The points listed in this circular do not apply to import goods for which the regulations stipulated in Circular No. 26 of April 4 of this year are still valid.</p>
<p>(6) For foreign exchange sold on or after August 19, if it is not settled by the due date, the designated bank may cancel the settlement at the exchange rate on the day of the forward sale. The designated bank must resell the cancelled foreign exchange to the Central Bank at the original purchase price.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Bond Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds remained difficult to rally due to scattered sales and cut-loss selling. Unified C opened in the morning at 1,800 yuan, and the highest price was only 1,850 yuan. It fell to 1,760 yuan midway, and hovered between 1,780 yuan and 1,800 yuan near the close. The process was extremely sluggish and without any special changes. The turnover was only over 2 million yuan. As a result, A, B, and C bonds fell by 80 yuan each compared with last Saturday, and D and E bonds fell by a small 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Depressed Foreign Stock Market</h3>
<p>The foreign stock market is still in a state of decline and unable to revive. The confidence of securities dealers is shaken. With the exception of the steel industry, all stocks are still showing a trend of volatility. Ewo Yarns was quite tortuous. It opened in the morning at 8,600 yuan and once fell to 8,000 yuan before struggling to recover. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the steel industry was flat, Wheelock and China General Edison Paper slightly weakened, Ewo Yarns and Ewo Brewery and shipping fell by half a percent, and British American Tobacco fell by a little more than ten percent.</p>
<h3>Settlements Came in One After Another The US Dollar Created a New High Price The Shanghai Gold Bar Followed the Trend</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gold Bar initially stabilized yesterday, with some pressure at the high price and much struggle. It opened slightly lower in the morning at around 2.175 million. After the opening, many long positions floated out, and buyers were disappointed, gradually falling from 2.178 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 30 bars at a price of 2.165 million. This has made it impossible to revive, and it cannot be boosted. In the morning, it stepped down to 2.15 million. However, at noon, the US dollar suddenly became popular again, and the gold price rose sharply to around 2.175 million. In the afternoon, it was once again stimulated by the scramble to buy US dollars and rose to over 2.19 million, before slightly falling back. As a result, it was similar to last Saturday. Gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars were all flat, and the dark interest rate was still around 1.3 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies initially weakened and then recovered. The US dollar opened in the morning at 3,750 yuan, and there was an outflow of settlements. The general long positions for the next week had mostly been settled. Midway, the market fell to 3,640 yuan before it was maintained. At noon, the trend of bargain hunting became prevalent again, and it surged again to over 3,800 yuan. In the afternoon, under the dual scramble to buy by those who were settling accounts and those who were freezing foreign exchange, it ended at a high price approaching 3,900 yuan. As a result, it was 110 yuan better than last Saturday, and the ratio to gold was pulled close to 562 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollar tickets were initially flat and then popular, and became even firmer and more expensive in the afternoon. Generally, those who did not obtain US dollars all searched for them, and it also rose by 20 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was around 760 yuan, and the Indian exchange rate was around 920 yuan. There were few sellers, and the British exchange rate was over 12,000 yuan. The US dollar exchange rate was completely exhausted.</p>
<h3>Written Guarantee by Brokers</h3>
<p>26 Designated Banks Handle it Themselves Replacements to be Redeemed Within One Month</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Securities Exchange stipulates that the margin for brokers is set at 50 million yuan for each of the bond and stock markets. In addition to the 40% cash portion, which was notified to all brokers on August 27 to pay, the remaining 60% in the form of securities and real estate replacements was submitted by the exchange to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy on August 24 of this year for flexible handling.

<h3>Rationed Yarn Rose by 70,000 Yesterday Still Cheaper than the Black Market Yarn Sales Slightly Sluggish Cotton Cloth Prices Soaring The Joint Venture of Textile Construction Supplies Not Much</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market reacted and fell back. Although the initial asking price in the morning was high, there were few buyers, and the price could not be supported. This was because the price had risen sharply on Friday and Saturday of last week, and buyers were watching and taking less action. Many long positions in the same industry were also taking profits and selling, and the price went downstream. 42-count and 20-count yarns fell by about 40,000 to 100,000, while the decline in 16-count yarn was limited. The opening price was in the range of 1.557 million, almost the same as the price of 20-count yarn, which is also rare in the recent yarn market. In the morning, futures for eight kinds of yarn were listed on the Textile Construction Exchange, using the joint venture distribution method. The price was not announced until about 7:00 PM (see the market price column).</p>
<p>Apply for Reduction Rationing Price Increased</p>
<p>After it was decided that the total amount of the second group of rationed yarn from national and private yarn factories would still be 30,000 pieces, Textile Construction was responsible for 12,000 pieces, and the private factories were responsible for 18,000 pieces. Yesterday afternoon, the Yarn Factory Joint Distribution Committee held its first yarn opening. It was not until after 5:00 PM that it was decided to open for sale a standard quantity of 20-count cotton yarn totaling 905 pieces from private factories, which were rationed at half the applied amount. In addition, before the second group of 30,000 pieces of rationed yarn was opened for sale after the first group of rationed yarn had been sold out, the factories opened for sale 2,644 pieces due to working capital reasons, which are now also included in the total amount of 30,000 pieces of the second group of rationed yarn. However, the rationing price is still calculated at 1.35 million yuan per piece. In addition, Textile Construction distributed a total of 1,625 pieces yesterday (however, Textile Construction Company news said that it distributed 1,501 pieces). The amount applied for, including various colors of cotton yarn, reached a total of 7,567 pieces. The opening price yesterday, with 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard, has been increased to 1.43 million yuan per piece. Compared with the previous opening price, it has risen by 70,000 yuan. According to market prices, the rationing price is still about 7% cheaper.</p>
<p>The Association's Notice Eight Measures</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt of the provisional measures decided by the meeting for yarn factories to open for sale cotton yarn:</p>
<p>1. Customers who purchase cotton yarn are temporarily limited to the original customers of each factory, and priority is given to applications from end users.</p>
<p>2. The above-mentioned end users who have a real need to purchase cotton yarn should first fill out an application form with the yarn factory they usually deal with, stating the count, quantity, purpose, and other items of the cotton yarn they intend to purchase. The amount of the application filled in by the customer must be limited to the actual needs. If there is speculation or false reporting, each factory may reduce or cancel its application qualification at its discretion.</p>
<p>3. After receiving and reviewing the purchase application form, each yarn factory will determine, based on past yarn purchase records, whether the applied quantity is accurate. If there is any inaccuracy, it should be corrected at any time and sent to the association for decision before 12:00 noon every day. Before 4:00 PM on the same day, the association will notify each yarn factory of the quantity and standard price (with 20-count cotton yarn as the standard) decided by the association, and forward it to the applicant. Each yarn factory and applicant may not increase or decrease the decided quantity and price on their own.</p>
<p>4. If there is a surplus of the amount of cotton yarn to be sold by each factory, the association will distribute it on behalf of the factory.</p>
<p>5. After receiving the notice, the applicant should sign a transaction contract with the factory on the same day and pay the full amount of the goods in cash on the next day.</p>
<p>6. When selling cotton yarn, each factory must ensure that each large package weighs 400 pounds net and each small package weighs 10 pounds net, and no small branches may be added separately.</p>
<p>7. The cotton yarn decided to be sold will be delivered as soon as possible, starting ten days after the date of payment.</p>
<p>8. If the applicant fails to fulfill the contract or make payment after receiving the decision notice, the association may cancel its application qualification.</p>
<p>Peak Season Cotton Cloth Prices Soaring</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market continued to soar. Although sales to various routes were declining, sales on this street were particularly strong. This was because it was the peak sales season, and there were many retail shares on this street. Therefore, buyers were in constant contact. Due to the fact that it was impossible to purchase spot goods, the supply from the Textile Construction Company, since the joint venture distribution method was adopted, the price has risen invisibly a lot, but the supply is still small. Therefore, we had to drop in recent futures to make adjustments. Yesterday, the opening price of high-end blanks was around 80,000 yuan, Yuan Biji was around 85,000 yuan, and Yuan Electric Light Twill was 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Market Selling Wind is Booming Hua Stocks are Universally Weak</h3>
<p>Hua stocks fell and declined yesterday. Yong Yarn had the support of the Guangdong Gang, and its condition was relatively stable. At the opening in the morning, each stock was more lively with popular stocks, still above the noon closing on Saturday of last week. After the opening, the two major popular stocks, Yong Yarn and Meyer, still had new long positions participating, and they once looked popular. However, the North Gang strongly sold Meyer, and Yong Yarn also suffered universal cut-loss selling under the unfavorable general situation. Even with the absorption of the Guangzhou Gang such as No. 184, it was difficult to stop the selling wind, only the process was slightly flatter than Meyer. Later, Meyer was repeatedly increased, and the panic was even worse. Midway, there was a lack of maintenance, and the buyers were helpless. So the entire stock market was shrouded in gloom, and the weakness was even worse. Due to the small number of chips in China Silk, although there was a fallback, it was extremely limited. Near the close, short positions profited and made up for it, and there was a slight recovery. As a result, Yong Yarn, Xinhe Silk Industry, New Asia, and Wuhe all showed a slight drop compared with the previous closing. Meyer, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, Tongyi, China Textile, Datong, Rongfeng, Match, and Liann fell by about half a percent. China Resources Cement alone fell by 15%, and cement fell by a little less than 10%. The total transaction amount was 6,014,400 shares, of which Yong Yarn accounted for 3,090,000 shares, Meyer accounted for 280,000 shares, Jingfu accounted for more than 800,000 shares, and Xinguang and Qinxing accounted for 350,000 shares. The rest were scattered transactions. The various stocks outside the market also fell by another half a percent.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice Fell Back Japonica Rice Firm Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Beans Rose More and Fell Less</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was clear, the source of indica rice continued, and digestion turned weak. Various indica rice fell back by a small 1,200 yuan, and white yuan fell by 2,300 yuan. However, the delivery of new japonica and aged japonica was scarce, and the market remained stable. It is estimated that the registration of customers and goods in the north and south markets was more than 11,000 stones. There was no market for flour yesterday, and there was no transaction for bran. Soybeans were both arriving and selling well, and the appetites of Shantou and Quanzhou were quite smooth, and the market rose by 2,000 yuan. The appetite of the Min Fang for wheat was very strong, the price rose step by step, and it rose by another 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were absorbed by both Nanyang and this street, and the demand exceeded the supply, and they continued to soar by 6,700 yuan. Red sorghum was scarce and also rose by 1,000 yuan. Mung beans were high and settled, broad beans rose by 1,000 yuan. There were both rises and falls in the oil market, and there were many raw oil goods, and they fell by more than 1,000 yuan again. Bean oil was upright and beautiful, rapeseed oil rose slightly, and soybean cake rose back by 3,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customs Person in Charge Talks Warehouses Have Been Cleared and Completed The Theft at Sea Has Been Brought Under Control</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs: More than 100 wharves and warehouses received by the customs have been cleared of enemy and puppet materials and returned to their original owners. Currently, only a few areas in the city center are waiting to be cleared, and they can also be returned by the end of this month. At present, imports and exports have not yet started due to transportation relations, and there are very few goods in the warehouses. Everyone feels that business is bleak.</p>
<p>Regarding theft incidents, the Customs is trying its best to prevent them and is strengthening its defense force. It will restore the maritime anti-smuggling vessels. Once the allocation is approved, the anti-smuggling team will be established. The current theft at sea has been brought under control. As for the theft incidents in wharves and warehouses, they are beyond the reach of power.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks Form Groups to Handle Loans One Group Has Been Established</h3>
<p>The loans for factories and exporters organized by the Central Bank are not limited to money houses, and commercial banks can also organize industrial and commercial loan syndicates to handle re-mortgages with the bank. It is learned that the banking industry has organized separately in accordance with the bank's regulations. The first group has been formally established, including 10 banks including Guanghua, Qiantai, Guangzhong, Dunxu, Minfu, Dalai, Bachuan, Huamao, Yongtai, and Guofu. The loan is in line with the Central Bank and will be signed in the near future. In addition, 17 banks including Chuanbang, Chuan Salt, Chuan Kang, Chongqing, Meifeng, and Juxingcheng, and 7 banks including Women's, Yongxiang, and Coal Industry are also being organized separately. The second and third syndicates can be formally established.</p>
<h3>Alarming Handling Fees There is No Fixed Amount</h3>
<p>According to the transportation industry: Recently, the handling fees for goods at various wharves have been shockingly high. A few days ago, Sullivan Company shipped 12,000 bags of flour from the United States, and it cost a total of 6.25 million yuan to transport them from the ship's cabin to the warehouse. The shipping companies also do not have a fixed amount for this item and must pay in advance before they can pick up the goods. In addition, when the cargo owner ships the goods from the warehouse within 10 days, he must pay a fee of 300 yuan per bag. Taking only 12,000 bags of flour as an example, the external cost from picking up the goods from the ship's cabin to the warehouse and shipping the goods from the warehouse has exceeded 10 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Rise in White Coal Intensifies Again</h3>
<p>The market price of white coal lumps in the coal market continued to rise. White coal small sizes also followed suit, white coal scraps were still flat, and screened lumps of bituminous coal were only distributed by the Fuel Management Committee. The Kaiping train original screened lumps at the Maigen Road depot in Puxi, which are of soft and poor quality, slightly increased in market price.</p>

<p>The previous classified income tax system in our country levied taxes based on income, such as profits from enterprises, interest from deposits, and rental income from houses. Therefore, it can be called an income tax. It failed to meet the principle of fair burden based on ability. Comprehensive income tax, however, taxes all income, so it is also known as general income tax. It uses the individual income of taxpayers as the calculation unit, so it is also called ad personam tax, that is, the total income of all kinds of income of each taxpayer is calculated, and then various expenses are deducted from the total income as the tax standard. For example, France implements comprehensive income tax, stipulating that all people in France with an annual income of more than 7,000 francs must pay this tax.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the new income tax law stipulates that in addition to the classified income tax levied in accordance with the preceding article, individuals whose total income exceeds 600,000 yuan shall be subject to a comprehensive income tax. The calculation method is to combine the individual's various incomes for the whole year into a total income, but the following items can be deducted: 1. 100,000 yuan per person for family members living together or relatives who must be supported; 2. 50,000 yuan per person for family members who are students in secondary schools or above; 3. Various income taxes and land taxes already paid (Article 19 of the same law). The method of declaration is that the obligated person shall report the type and amount of income of the previous year to the主管征收機關 (competent collection authority) before May 1 each year. The 主管征收機關 (competent collection authority) and the district and township offices or central primary schools establish a joint declaration association for review (Article 26 of the same law) to avoid the malpractice of false reports or non-reporting.</p>
<p>In the past, our country used the excuse of lax household registration and incomplete statistics to not implement the comprehensive income tax. This resolute decision to implement it this time is not without considerable reason. In the future, the collection of comprehensive income tax will be fraught with difficulties, which is inevitable. As the saying goes, "Human effort can overcome heaven," and it is expected that there will be a day to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the comprehensive income tax, people in the society and the public opinion circles feel that there is a suspicion of duplication. In fact, the classified income tax is a tax on income, and the comprehensive income tax is a tax on people, and there is no duplication, because the objects are different. The comprehensive income tax is most in line with the principle of ability to pay, and at the same time, the progressive tax system must adopt progressive tax rates. Our country's classified income tax is limited by the environment and insufficient conditions, and has failed to give full play to its effectiveness, so that those who have more pay more, and those who have less pay less. Taking the income from securities deposits as an example, both 10,000 yuan and 10,000,000 yuan of deposit income are subject to 10%, which is unreasonable. Therefore, the government adopts comprehensive income tax to make up for its deficiencies and prevent the concentration of wealth. The original intention of the legislation is perfect, and whether the implementation can be smooth remains to be seen the efforts of those in charge. Furthermore, considering the advanced countries, those who first levy classified income tax and then levy comprehensive income tax include France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Moreover, the tax rates of comprehensive income tax in various countries are higher than those in our country. For example, the United States has a minimum tax rate of 13%, the United Kingdom has a tax rate of 10%, Japan has a tax rate of 10%, the United States has a maximum tax rate of 72%, the United Kingdom has a tax rate of 45%, Japan has a tax rate of 60%, while our country has a minimum tax rate (that is, those exceeding 600,000 yuan) of 5%, and a maximum tax rate of only 50%.</p>
<p>(4) A Major Prerequisite - Economic Stability</p>
<p>The newly promulgated income tax law this time has taken into account the actual situation and objective needs in terms of content, and is gradually moving towards a more reasonable path, which is encouraging. However, only four months have passed since the promulgation of the new income tax law. Due to the daily depreciation of the currency and the rising prices of goods, all clauses seem to have lost their timeliness. Taking only the starting point of the comprehensive income tax in the new income tax law as an example, it is already too low. It is reported that this starting point was based on the pre-war Shanghai living survey data and the retail price increase of 2,220 times in September of the 34th year of the Republic of China. According to the Shanghai 主要商品零售物價指數 (Main Commodity Retail Price Index) compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, Shanghai's current prices have increased more than 3,700 times in June of this year. Now it is more than three months, plus the exchange rate adjustment, and prices have generally increased, estimated to be 4,000 times or even 10,000 times. In contrast, all suffer from the disease of being outdated. The other provisions, such as the tax exemption point for salary and remuneration income tax, are also the same. Therefore, all good laws and good intentions must be based on one major premise - economic stability - to be effective. (The End)</p>

<h3>Travelogue in Northern Jiangsu (6) Blood Shadows on the Battlefield East of Taixian County</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Hang Zhou</p>
<p>Taixian Dispatch, 10th of This Month</p>
<p>There are two long embankments in northern Jiangsu that are well known: on the left is the Grand Canal embankment, and on the right is the 范公堤 (Fan Gong Dyke). Between the embankments is a large area of lakes and marshes. In the past, people feared every year that floods would collapse the Grand Canal embankment, turning this area into a swamp. Since the Communist Party's army came to northern Jiangsu, people's fear of floods has been transferred. —— There are too many examples to prove that wherever the Communist army goes, it becomes a "sea of blood." —— "Sea of blood" is a more terrifying term than "flood"!</p>
<p>The topography of northern Jiangsu limits military activities, so the battles are fought either on the Grand Canal embankment or on the Fan Gong Dyke. When the Shaobo battle in late August was in full swing, the Communist army launched a sudden attack on the right flank, and battles broke out once again in places like Rugao, Haian, Qutang, and Huangqiao. The people who had just returned to their hometowns once again embarked on the road to destruction.</p>
<p>As a result, the focus of the war quickly shifted to the right. The Communist army's offensive was obviously not only echoing the left flank, but also attempting to further seize Liangtai and threaten Jiangnan. More than a month ago, the Communist army had made such an attempt and suffered a crushing defeat. Now it is reorganizing its forces, and the national army must of course crush it again.</p>
<p>Second Phase of the War Second Act</p>
<p>The situation on the right flank is dangerous, and the Communist army is very rampant. Taking Haian as an example, the Communist army used twelve regiments to surround the national army, which was only one-fifth of its size, but after fighting for more than a week, the Communist army could not move Haian even a little bit. Qutang and Daxiaobaimi have already fallen into the hands of the Communist army. The situation in Huangqiao was once unclear, and fighting is still going on nearby. In the bag-shaped area from Rugao to Baimi in the northwest and Huangqiao in the southwest, there are even more mobile Communist troops. Large and small battles are constantly taking place on the periphery of Taixian and Taixing counties.</p>
<p>The right flank is "lively," while the left flank appears silent. On September 6, the reporter boarded a "wild chicken" bus running on the Yangtai Road in Yangzhou to see the second act of the second phase of the war in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The Yangtai Road is a major artery in northern Jiangsu at present. The national army has put in a lot of effort to open it up and maintain it. There are many fortresses on both sides of the road. These fortresses have all been stained with blood in front of them. Although they can no longer be seen now, I have seen one by one the smiles of the farmers who are harvesting the abundant rice crop in exchange for those bloodstains. This year is a great harvest year in northern Jiangsu. The Chinese farmers who "depend on the sky for food" should have thanked God, but in Gaoyou, Baoying... in those so-called "liberated areas," how many farmers are still shedding tears over their harvest!</p>
<p>Universal Vigor and Vitality Doing What One Says</p>
<p>After passing through checkpoints one after another, I arrived in Taixian. This is the reporter's second trip to Tai. Yangzhou is like a middle-aged woman, but Taixian is much younger. What I feel is universal vigor and vitality. County Magistrate Ding Zuobin is a graduate of the 16th class of the military academy and has served as a guerrilla commander. He is a complete soldier. The district chiefs, township chiefs, militia captains, and even the secretaries and section chiefs in the county government all have relationships with the military academy and guerrilla warfare. They have shared hardships and are now facing hardships. They usually joke around, but when they get down to business, they are really energetic and quick. Among the counties controlled by the national army in northern Jiangsu, Taixian can be said to be the one that cooperates with the military the most. Repairing roads and building fortifications are done as soon as they are said. Ding Zuobin cannot sit idly in the county government office for three days. He likes to run around and see everything. Some things require four or five official documents to be transferred and put on hold for ten days and eight days. He goes to the countryside himself and solves them with a single sentence.</p>
<p>The soldiers now are not all roughnecks, and some have quite good political cultivation. Ding Zuobin has the straightforward and enthusiastic personality of a northerner. The people of Taixian are proud to have such a county magistrate. He said that he doesn't know how to be an official, he only knows how to do things. He scolds his subordinates "not to spoil his affairs."</p>
<p>Jiangnan is a land of fish and rice, while Jiangbei is a land of salt and rice. They are both equally rich. If Jiangnan and Jiangbei have different sentiments, the most obvious may be in terms of the people's character: Jiangnan is weaker, while Jiangbei is quite strong. Strong people with organization are a very good local armed force. The general feeling in northern Jiangsu is that the local armed forces are not enough, but Taixian has silently made quite a bit of progress. Every township has a militia, with more than 2,000 people and more than 1,000 guns, helping the army a lot.</p>
<p>In the past two days, Dasizhuang, which is more than 20 miles southeast of Taixian and 18 miles away from the Kou-Tai Highway, was attacked by the Communist army. There were no national troops stationed there, and the militia resisted on its own, not allowing the Communist army to take advantage of it. Ding Zuobin received the report and personally led four or five hundred militiamen to reinforce it, driving the Communist army away in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Jiangyan Approaching the Front Line Listening to Machine Gun Fire</p>
<p>On September 7, the reporter, accompanied by Wu Xiaode, Chief of Staff of the 108th Brigade, and Staff Officer Gao Hongsheng, inspected the eastern battlefield of Taixian, and Ding Zuobin also went along.</p>
<p>Starting early in the morning, we first went to Jiangyan. On the Tai-Jiang Road, commercial vehicles were nowhere to be seen, and military vehicles rushed around, quickly covering 36 miles. Jiangyan is a large town and a distribution center for grain. In previous years, the grain transport ships that stopped here were connected for three or four miles. It is only ten miles away from Magou, the front line here, and the sound of machine guns can be heard clearly every night. Having gotten used to it, no one is disturbed by it. A bathhouse is still painting its facade and choosing a lucky day to open. We didn't stay long and rushed to Magou.</p>
<p>In the sense of defending Taixian, Magou is a very important stronghold. Since the Communist army launched its offensive, it has cut off the Tai-Hai Road. On the evening of August 29, it gathered more than two regiments and took advantage of the fact that the national army had just changed its defenses, and rushed straight to Magou, hoping to take it in one fell swoop, coerce Jiangyan, and threaten Taixian. The garrison in Magou only had one company, but this company was not flustered at all. "Fighting doesn't depend on having a lot of people," they calmly guarded the fortifications, killing one when it came, and killing two together. The Communist army surrounded Magou and charged again and again, and those who came up could not go back. Company Commander Zheng Yadong listened to the Communist army's charge horn in the trench. It blew a total of 20 times, indicating that the 19 charges had all failed, and the 20th charge could not avoid its final fate, and they also fell down. The dark night passed away in the battle, and the sound of gunfire on the other side died down. The brothers jumped out of the trenches to greet the rays of the sun and took a look: "Ah! So many corpses!" They were so excited that they forgot their fatigue and counted them. There were three or four hundred bodies.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived in Magou, the brothers of Zheng Yadong's company scrambled to tell me about this wonderful battle. I deliberately spoiled their fun and asked:</p>
<p>"How many casualties did you have?"</p>
<p>"One dead and four wounded," a soldier replied triumphantly.</p>
<p>One to four hundred, or five to two thousand (the total number of Communist army casualties), this record must make the Communist army gnash their teeth.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the impetuous Communist army came to "avenge" every night after that, but every night they brought corpses as gifts.</p>
<p>We once stood on a fortress to observe the terrain. I asked Battalion Commander Zhao Haiyun:</p>
<p>"How far is this from the Communist army's outpost?"</p>
<p>"Half a mile at most."</p>
<p>"Isn't it dangerous?" I asked in a very bookish tone.</p>
<p>"They dare not - the Communist army comes out at night."</p>
<p>Parachutes Ejected Supplying the Garrison</p>
<p>Back in Jiangyan, it was 3 p.m. After resting for a while, when we were preparing to return to Taixian, a bomber flew over the sky, slowly circling, seemingly looking for a target. Having seen too many planes, we paid no attention to it, when suddenly cries of alarm erupted from all around: "Dropping bombs!" People were shouting and running. I was also taken aback. Looking up, I saw several parachutes floating in the sky, swaying as they descended. "Not like bombs," I thought intuitively: "Bombs shouldn't be dropped here." But if it's not a bomb, it shouldn't be dropped here either. I thought again: "The plane must have mistaken the place."</p>
<p>The things that fell from the parachutes did not explode. "The plane probably mistook Jiangyan for Haian. The besieged garrison in Haian needs supplies." I thought further.</p>
<p>However, the plane did not realize its mistake, and it continued to eject parachutes one by one like a lotus flower. The villagers had never seen this thing before and rushed to the fields to search for it. Wu Zhifen, the commander of the 324th Regiment, ordered all the dropped items to be concentrated at the regimental headquarters for disposal.</p>
<p>At dusk, we returned to Taixian. The brigade contacted the air force and confirmed that the batch of things was to supply the garrison in Haian.</p>
<p>Although the siege of Haian has not been completely lifted, and the Communist troops in other places are still harassing everywhere, the dangerous period for northern Jiangsu has passed after the national army's redeployment. The army and people of northern Jiangsu have faith. "Where did the New Fourth Army come from? Beat it back where it came from!" A wild child adapted a song and sang. The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming! "The round moon shines on Kyushu, some families are happy and some are sad?" The food shops in Taixian started preparing two days ago to celebrate this poetic and picturesque festival, but the refugees who have no home to return to, sadly facing the bright moon, don't know how much new sorrow has been added!</p>

<h3>The Appeal of the Wuxi Knitting Industry</h3>
<p>Editor: The industry of Wuxi City has always been known for its development, and it is called "Little Shanghai". The knitting industry in Wuxi also had a glorious history in the past, but since the victory, it has declined due to the dumping of foreign goods. Especially due to the lack of working capital, it has had to borrow high-interest loans, and has fallen into a difficult struggle. The government should promptly allocate industrial loans to alleviate the difficulties. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association has organized an industrial loan syndicate to help small and medium-sized factories. I hope that it can be realized as soon as possible, and that the scope of loans can be expanded and handled fairly, so as to be in line with the actual situation and be widely available. In addition, the China Textile Corporation has always provided yarn, but it has not yet sold yarn to the knitting industry in Wuxi City, which uses the most yarn. I hope that it will be implemented quickly to reduce costs and compete for the market. (Wuxi County Knitting Industry Association)</p>
<h3>Be Careful When Buying Fake Quinine Pills</h3>
<p>To the Shen Bao 館 (Shen Bao Newspaper Office) and the Health Departments of all provinces of the Central Health Administration: This year, Shuangtao Quinine Pills are very expensive. General speculators only know how to seek profit and do not care about the lives of patients. They openly manufacture and sell fake pills to make profits. Some of them do not meet the standards, and some are entirely powdered and contain no quinine at all. General informal pharmacies, general goods shops, and drug stores in the interior purchase from vendors and sell them at the price of genuine brands. The ignorant rural people cannot distinguish between the genuine and the fake, and purchase and take them, but they are ineffective, so that the genuine products also lose their credibility. Such sales and manufacture of fake drugs harms patients, delays lives, and is a crime that cannot be forgiven. I especially ask your department to strictly order your subordinates to earnestly investigate and arrest them, so as to warn evil people and emphasize hygiene. I am very fortunate! (Doctor Yu Rubing)</p>
<h3>Use Vacant Land to Build Vegetable Markets</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Dihua Middle Road and Wuyuan Road in western Shanghai, there are vegetable stalls along the road, and the entry and exit of vehicles is very inconvenient. In recent years, the population has been large, and residents are overcrowded when buying vegetables. In addition, it is a major thoroughfare, and cars often have dangerous incidents. Residents are quite wary when traveling to and from. I think it is better to build a temporary vegetable market on the large open space at the intersection of Linsen Road and Fuxing West Road in the east, made of planks, like the style of the Nanshi South District Street. This equipment does not cost much, and stall rental fees can be collected. Moreover, the land has been vacant for a long time, which can avoid the accumulation of garbage and benefit hygiene. It is reported that the land was once owned by the enemy and puppets, so I respectfully suggest to the authorities that if it can be adopted, it will be beneficial to traffic safety and public hygiene. (Wang Shaofu)</p>
<h3>Property Registration Certificate Fee is Too High</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, in order to facilitate collection, is handling transfer registration because the county was occupied for eight years and the land property was either sold or transferred. Our office belongs to the county, and because it is separated by the Huangpu River, it is very inconvenient to travel back and forth (the county government is in Minhang, west of the Huangpu River, while Districts 4 and 5 are east of the Huangpu River). A special commissioner was sent to the district office to handle it, saving the villagers the trouble of traveling back and forth, which is a good intention. However, the handling fee is as high as 6,800 yuan per mu. A house is counted as one mu, and a house in a city or town is counted as two mu. The high price is really unexpected. It is said that Chuansha County only charges 500 yuan per mu, why is there a difference of more than ten times? (Hu Zhifu of Chenxing Town)</p>
<h3>Why Obstruct the Sale of Purchase Coupons?</h3>
<p>Editor: We are promoting national goods market purchase coupons for the education loan. We are all students, but this time we went out to promote it was not sent by the school, but we went out automatically in the Sanminzhuyi Youth League. We hold the purpose of contributing money and effort, so we have no complaints. On the evening of August 30, we went to the St. Thérèse in Central Tibet Road. The person in charge inside did not allow us to go in to promote national goods coupons. May I ask why he did not allow us to go in to promote them? May I ask if he is Chinese? We went out in such hot weather and ran around to promote national goods coupons. What is it for? Is it for our own private interests? You must know that we are doing it for the country and for poor students, and we are not promoting it to his employees, but to the customers who are drinking coffee in their seats. Are they unfeeling people? Even their own motherland does not matter, and they told us to go outside and asked us to sign. We signed the Youth League. What does the school want? What do they mean? They said: "You come in batches every three to five minutes, and you come in batches every three to five minutes, which is hindering our business." That is really not the way to put it. Do we want to mess with your St. Thérèse for our own private interests and not want the country? Besides, we did not hinder their business anywhere. I hope that in the future, they will have less selfish intentions and there will be no such phenomenon again. The Third Fundraising Team of the National Goods Coupon respectfully.</p>
<h3>Suxian Letters Take Nine Days to Arrive</h3>
<p>Editor: This time my friend went to Suzhou, and I asked him to write to me as soon as he arrived in Suzhou, but there has been no news. I thought my friend had broken his promise, but I did not receive my friend's letter until the 3rd of this month. Looking at the date of dispatch, it was August 25. In the past, friends on the Beijing-Shanghai line would write to me in only three days, and it would only take two days from Shanghai to Pudong. Now it takes three days from Shanghai to Pudong, and it takes nine days for a letter from Suzhou to Pudong. I hope that the postal authorities will improve it as soon as possible. (Chen Ping)</p>

<h3>Discussion on Knitting</h3>
<p>— Huang Peiying</p>
<p>Clothes knitted with wool are very light, warm, and comfortable to wear, making them extremely popular. It's almost impossible to find someone who doesn't have one. Therefore, the knitting business has a broad scope of activity and a bright future. Twenty years ago, I developed a great interest in the knitting business. At that time, in addition to studying various domestic knitting methods, I further researched Japanese knitting methods and gained some experience. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, I established a knitting training center and provided knitting tools, teaching novel knitting methods. At the time, many people came to learn, and the products were very well received. The products were displayed at the National Goods Exhibition of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and won a special prize certificate and a gold medal. Later, due to the slow pace of handmade products, I referred to the needle-replacing machines used by the Japanese and made inventions and improvements, making the products three times faster than handmade. This type of needle-replacing machine was named the "Wool Knitting Needle Replacer" and was granted a patent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, obtaining a patent license. It was widely promoted at the time, but since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, this type of needle-replacing machine could not continue to be manufactured. Although there were plans to manufacture it after the victory, due to various reasons, it has not yet been able to meet readers this year. I cannot help but deeply regret this.</p>
<p>However, handmade knitting only requires carrying a needle and thread, and you can work anytime, anywhere, which has its convenience. However, styles and knitting methods are changing with each passing day. I plan to discuss them with readers in this publication.</p>
<h3>How to Knit a Wool Sweater? Two Latest Styles</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Please look at Ms. Yan Huizhu, the "Queen of Peking Opera." Look at her wearing this latest style wool sweater. Her demeanor is calm, dignified, very beautiful, and elegant.</p>
<p>Tools: Two Peiying No. 9 knitting needles, one sewing needle.</p>
<p>Materials: Two skeins of Double Cat brand dark red yarn, ten skeins of blue yarn.</p>
<p>Stitch count: Six stitches per pattern.</p>
<p>Knitting method: Cast on 160 stitches and knit using a cross-stitch pattern to a height of six inches. Then knit one inch high with dark red, one stitch knit, one stitch purl. At this time, decrease 52 stitches on each side using the decrease method shown in practice figure ten (for the pocket opening). Separately, cast on 48 stitches with two knitting needles and knit in stockinette stitch to a height of six inches. Knit two pieces in the same way (for the pocket flaps). Now connect these two pieces to the decreased sides, continuing with the same blue yarn and original pattern. Afterward, decrease one stitch on each side every half inch, decreasing a total of 22 stitches. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every half inch, increasing a total of 32 stitches. At this time, it is time to shape the armholes. Decrease one stitch on each side every other row, decreasing a total of 40 stitches. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every other row, adding back the 40 stitches that were decreased. (But start increasing stitches when you have knitted two inches high. At this time, you need to shape the neckline. Leave 30 stitches in the center with a needle. Now you need to knit the two sides separately. Leave one stitch at the neckline every row until you have added enough stitches at the armhole. The other side is the same).</p>
<p>Back piece knitting method: Cast on 86 stitches. Knit eight stitches knit one, purl one on one side edge. The rest is still knitted with the same pattern as the front piece, to a height of five inches. Continue to decrease one stitch every half inch on the side that is not knit knit one, purl one, decreasing a total of 15 stitches. Continue to increase one stitch every half inch on the decreased side, increasing a total of 15 stitches. Then shape the armholes in the same way as the front piece, to the same height. The other half of the back piece is knitted in the same way. (But on the edge that is knit eight stitches knit one, purl one, you need to make a buttonhole every three inches (i.e., add one stitch, decrease one stitch). After the front and back pieces are knitted, sew them together using the sewing method in the rear diagram.</p>
<p>Neckline knitting method: Use dark red yarn to knit a one knit, one purl rib for two inches high around the stitches left at the neckline, then bind off. Fold the one inch high rib towards the reverse side and sew it down to make a double layer.</p>
<p>Armhole edge knitting method: Pick up one stitch in each hole around the armhole, picking up a total of 140 stitches. Knit one knit, one purl rib for one inch high (using dark red). The other side is the same.</p>
<p>Belt knitting method: Cast on 13 stitches with dark red yarn and knit one knit, one purl rib to a height of twenty-two inches. Then decrease one stitch on each side every row, decreasing until finished. Make it into a pointed end. Make another one the same way. After knitting, sew them on both sides of the waist on the front piece.</p>
<p>There is also a latest style of wool sweater from 1946. Its style is derived from this year's American clothing samples. It looks even more beautiful and lively when worn by the famous female Peking Opera performer, Tong Zhiling.</p>
<p>Tools: Two Peiying No. 9 knitting needles, one sewing needle.</p>
<p>Materials: Thirteen skeins of Bian Mao brand 4-ply wool yarn.</p>
<p>Knitting method: Cast on 150 stitches, and knit with the same flower pattern as the back, but decrease one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total decrease of forty stitches. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total increase of thirty-two stitches. At this time, it is necessary to shape the armholes. Decrease one stitch on each side every other row, for a total decrease of thirty-two stitches. Knit for four inches high without increasing or decreasing.</p>
<p>Front panel knitting method: Cast on eighty stitches. Like the back panel, decrease one stitch every half inch for a total of twenty stitches (but when knitting one inch high, knit sixteen stitches on the side that is not decreasing first. From the seventeenth stitch, knit forty-four stitches, knit two, purl two, to a height of one inch, and then bind off these forty-four stitches using the knit-off-stitch method shown in diagram ten. This is the pocket opening.) Use two needles and cast on forty-four stitches for a height of six inches, and then connect it to the middle of the forty-four-stitch pocket opening and knit it together using the original pattern. When one side is decreased to twenty stitches, continue to increase one stitch every half needle, for a total of sixteen stitches. At this time, the armhole should be shaped, the pattern changed, and the neckline shaped. On the side that is flat and not increasing or decreasing, decrease one stitch every three rows from then on, for a total of twenty stitches, to form the neckline (but it must be decreased from the eleventh stitch, because those ten stitches are the center edge; see the rear diagram for the flower pattern knit-off-stitch method). Shape the armhole by decreasing one stitch every other row, for a total decrease of sixteen stitches. Knit until the same height as the back panel. The method for the other side is the same, except that the ten-stitch edge on the front panel must be knit five and a half inches longer, because there is no edge on the back panel neckline. When these ten stitches have been knit to a length of five and a half inches, sew them to the ten stitches on the other side of the front panel. For the remaining stitches, sew the front and back panels together using the sewing method shown in the rear diagram.</p>
<p>Sleeve knitting method: Cast on fifty stitches, and knit with the rice stitch. Afterwards, increase one stitch on each side every other row, for a total of fifty stitches. Continue knitting for eleven inches without increasing or decreasing. Then, in one row, decrease forty stitches (i.e., decrease one stitch, decrease one stitch, knit one stitch, and so on.) so that one hundred stitches remain sixty stitches. Continue knitting for three and a half inches, knit two, purl one. The knitting method for the other sleeve is the same. When sewing it onto the garment, if the top of the sleeve is too large, it can be slightly puffed up on the shoulder blade.</p>
<p>Belt knitting method: Cast on nine stitches and knit with the rice stitch to a height of twenty-eight inches. Continue to decrease one stitch on each side every other row, decreasing until finished. Make it into a pointed end.</p>
<p>After the garment is completely knitted, embroider it on the left side of the front panel according to the embroidery pattern. Whatever design you like, you can embroider it as you like. The color scheme can also be as you like.</p>
<h3>Washing and Preserving Wool Products</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>The Special Qualities of Wool: Before discussing how to wash wool products, we should first know the special qualities of wool. The main component of wool, the wool fiber, has what is called an outer scale, which must not be rubbed vigorously. If rubbed too vigorously, the fluff on the wool yarn will form clumps, losing its original beauty. Wool yarns have a very weak alkaline reaction, so you must use high-quality soap when washing them, otherwise the wool yarn will easily become stiff. If you are washing colored wool yarn, and there is a possibility of fading when washing, you must first use a color-fixing method before washing. The color-fixing method is to mix one teaspoon of tannic acid and one teaspoon of acetic acid in one liter of clean water, put the item to be washed in it and soak for five or six minutes, and then wash it.</p>
<p>Washing Method: The washing method is to first remove the dust, so wash it in clear water. After washing three or four times, put it in soapy water and move it up, down, left, and right. Afterwards, rinse it with clean water and then use the acid-through method. The acid-through method has the effect of protecting the luster of the wool and preventing damage to the wool, so you must perform the acid-through method at the end of washing wool products. The acid-through method is very simple. You can put half a glass of acetic acid or two glasses of ordinary vinegar in one liter of clean water to make acidic water. Put the washed item in it and soak for five or six minutes, and then take it out and dry it.</p>
<p>Drying Method: The drying method cannot be like other things where you squeeze it dry vigorously. After the acid-through method, take it out and place it on a flat board to stretch it out, then smooth the shape, and then tilt the board up and place it in a cool, shady place to dry, so you can maintain the original beauty of the item.</p>
<p>Preservation Method: As for the preservation method, the most important thing is to prevent insect infestation and to prevent the item from discoloring and deteriorating. The first method of insect prevention is to wash all the stains completely before storing it, which will be effective. At the same time, the washed item must be fully dried and must be stored in a dry place. When storing, each item should be wrapped separately in paper, and camphor or mothballs should be placed in the middle, and they must be wrapped in thin paper bags to prevent the powder from camphor, etc., from getting stuck in the seams and being difficult to remove. After wrapping them like this, store them in a cabinet or box, and then place the box in a dry, shady place, and do not let the sun shine directly on it, so you can prevent discoloration and deterioration.</p>
<h3>Mother First</h3>
<p>— Yinguo</p>
<p>The "women's liberation" movement of the past ten years has indeed seen some women doing things that benefit the community, no less than men. But unfortunately, most women, especially urban women, after being "liberated," not only continue to live a dependent life, but even no longer want to be as submissive as before, but only know how to enjoy rights and do not want to fulfill obligations, and have even broken down the concept of "virtuous wife and good mother."</p>
<p>Children are the cornerstone of future society and the pillars of the country. If we want the future country and society to become more perfect, we must do our best to promote children's education.</p>
<p>The education that children receive in school is mechanical and limited, and teachers cannot follow students all day long to teach them at any time. Therefore, the education of children should be the equal responsibility of parents and teachers. In school, it is the teacher's responsibility, and at home, it should be the parents' responsibility. Especially mothers, because children have more frequent contact with their mothers than with their fathers, there is no doubt that children's will and temperament will tend to follow their mother's teachings and instructions. In the corners of the city, it is easy to see that when a mother is engrossed in gambling or playing outside all day long, they easily give their children money and hand over the responsibility of supervision to servants, or let their children associate with the lower classes. Of course, "those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black," and the children will learn everything: gambling, swearing…</p>
<p>Raising a child is like cultivating a flower or grass. If it is cared for, cherished, and planted by a diligent gardener, it will always thrive. On the contrary, if it encounters a lazy gardener who lets it be exposed to the sun and rain without pruning its branches, there is no doubt that this flower or grass will eventually wither.</p>
<p>Look at the great men of the world. Their success is almost always influenced by their mother's diligent teaching, because they can use their observational skills to identify the child's psychology, grasp the child's emotions, and instill pure ideas to cultivate and correct them.</p>
<p>Of course, not every mother in the world can raise their children into great men, but at least they should not raise parasites that are of no use to society, the community, or the country.</p>
<p>May all mothers in the world take on this great responsibility!</p>
<h3>Reasoning with Children</h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>(1) It's Not Just the Rose That's Like This</p>
<p>In my grandmother's garden, there was a rose that had already grown buds, but it didn't bloom for many days. This made me feel very impatient, because I was eager to see its beautiful petals and colors. I prepared to give it a helping hand and make it bloom. With my grandmother's permission, I unfolded its petals one by one. In the end, the rose seemed to bloom, but it was not as beautiful and moving as I had seen before. Undoubtedly, the rose's inherent beauty was destroyed by me, and it quickly withered and died. My grandmother saw it and said to me gently, "Everything is like this. Roses can only produce beautiful flowers in a certain order and at a certain time."</p>
<p>(2) The Lesson of the Basket</p>
<p>The six children in our family always liked to talk about other people's private affairs, spreading gossip, which was harmful to others and not beneficial to themselves. Our father hated our bad habit very much. One day, he brought back a package and said, "I bought each of you a small basket. When you have something to talk about, write it down and put it in your basket. After the basket is full, you can examine it one by one and see how much meaning there is. At first, we thought it was a ridiculous job, but soon we became very careful about what we said. After a while, we simply forgot about this bad habit of talking about others. Later, our father explained, "This little basket has become your monitor. Now you will no longer bring nonsense from school, the office, or the factory to harm others. Although your baskets are empty, they are more meaningful than when they were full."</p>
<h3>Good Wife</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gangren</p>
<p>No matter what you think, you are not the good wife you should be if: —</p>
<p>You tell your friends: "It's so annoying! My husband he…."</p>
<p>You dress up more carefully when you go out alone to attend a party than when your husband accompanies you to see a movie.</p>
<p>You prefer to tell your husband how hard you have worked all day, rather than tell him how these work experiences have added to your enjoyment.</p>
<p>When you want to chat with your own friends, you leave your husband and family unattended.</p>
<p>You tell your husband the bad news at dinner, not when you know your husband is in a good mood.</p>
<p>You are never satisfied with the house you currently live in and always want new things to make it more beautiful.</p>
<p>You decorate your "home" well, and seem to value your friends' praise more than the comfort your husband gets from it.</p>
<p>You have no interest in entertaining your husband's friends.</p>
<p>You would rather choose your own gifts yourself than take the "risk" that he might buy you something you don't like.</p>
<p>You often say: "I want my husband to do this and that," instead of saying: "I hope he can do this and that, if he is willing."</p>
<p>You never let your husband get the credit for a certain opinion until he has done it well.</p>
<p>You never ask your husband's opinion about anything. (Originally published in The China Press)</p>
<h3>How to Manage Servants</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Every housewife who manages a household must supervise her servants at all times and see if their measures and actions are appropriate. She must not neglect them. The method of supervision should have common sense. Then, when she speaks and gives orders, she will be able to be fair and just, so that the servants will obey and behave without any actions that go beyond the norm. The following are several points that a housewife should have knowledge of. Readers should consider them carefully and supplement them with experience. You will naturally be able to achieve the subtlety of commanding at will!</p>
<p>When selecting servants, only seek diligence and simplicity, and be sure to examine their nature to see if they can obey the master's orders? Do not judge based on the amount of wages. Honest servants are diligent in their work and benefit the master in no small way. It is appropriate for them to demand a good price. As for lazy and dissolute people, who steal time and enjoy leisure, or are stubborn and difficult to train, even if the wages are low, the gains and losses are not enough to offset them. Therefore, the best servants are those who are diligent and thrifty, and who are gentle in nature and have no heart of arrogance or rudeness. This is considered qualified. Conversely, it is not easy to manage them. Even if they have special skills, they should not be hired, lest they cause trouble later.</p>
<p>For people living at home, clean clothes and utensils are the most important thing, and so are servants. Gorgeous clothes are not appropriate, and damaged and dirty clothes are also unsightly. The reason why clothes are dirty and tattered is not because of poverty, but mostly because of laziness and laziness in washing and mending. As the saying goes, "The effort of one stitch, when sewing is timely, is enough to save the labor of nine stitches." If a servant does not know how to clean themselves, it is impossible to expect them to be diligent in other things. It is like climbing a tree to catch fish, which is impossible. As for servants flaunting their clothes and dressing up like their mistresses, it is also not appropriate. The master should patiently guide them, teach them to save, and explain the benefits and harms of extravagance. She should tell them that the money earned from labor is very little and should not be wasted at will. She should also tell them that people who earn a living through physical labor sometimes have to stop working, or they may suddenly suffer from old age or illness, and they will need money for support. If they do not save regularly, when something happens, they will not know where to get it in a hurry. In general, all hired workers should be diligent and thrifty and not be extravagant. If clothes are torn, they should be mended, not thrown away. They should not indulge in eating and drinking. As for shopping and socializing, they should also be restrained at all times to save money. As the ancient saying goes, "Saving one penny is the same as earning one penny." Otherwise, if they indulge in their desires without satisfaction, they will inevitably fall into extravagance, and when the money is gone and they are empty-handed, they will have improper thoughts. When they reach the end of the road, it will be too late to regret their mistakes!</p>
<p>The duties that servants should perform are numerous and cannot be listed one by one, such as cooking, washing, sweeping, and cleaning utensils, and caring for children. All of these are their duties. However, cooking and washing each have specific duties, which cannot be explained in a simple way. In wealthy families, there are many servants, and each has their own job, such as cooks and wet nurses. Even if this is not the case, the master must assign their duties and cannot entrust everything to one person. However, sweeping and cleaning the house and cleaning the utensils are the usual duties of servants. Now let me talk about them as follows:</p>
<p>Get up at dawn, open the windows and doors, and roll up the curtains to let fresh air into the room. If it is winter, and there is a stove in the room, you must first remove the ashes and leftover charcoal, and then sweep the floor. When removing the ashes, the technique should be gentle, and it is best to cover the gold and porcelain utensils, chairs, and wall clothes in the room with cloth to prevent dust from collecting. When sweeping the floor, first sprinkle water on it, which can also reduce the spread of dust. After sweeping, wipe the windows. All glass cabinets, fences, and the edges of mirrors and picture frames must be wiped. If there are copper or steel utensils, they should be rubbed with soft leather to prevent them from rusting. If rust is seen, it must be sanded with sandpaper or coated with lime, and it must be smooth before stopping. Other items, such as tables, chairs, and frames, must be wiped so that there are no stains left. All of these things should be done before the master gets up. Once the master gets up, the bedroom must be cleaned, the bedding must be spread, and it must be swept and wiped as described above.</p>
<p>If there are vases or water-filled basins in the room, they must be emptied and refilled with clean water every day.</p>
<p>Every few days, the quilts and pillows should be exposed to the sun. Other things, such as sweeping the stairs or beating the carpets, must be done on sunny days and when you have free time. Do not annoy the master. In the evening, close the windows and lock the doors. Do not be lazy or forgetful. These are also the duties of servants.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief discussion, but you must provide guidance in a proper way so that you can enjoy the benefits. If there are any mistakes, you must gently persuade them and show them kindness so that the servants will return with gratitude and be sincerely convinced. Otherwise, even if you spend a lot of money, you will not be able to buy their loyalty, which is not the best policy.</p>
<h3>Save the Unfortunate Children Made by Man</h3>
<p>— Chen Xin</p>
<p>There are many unfortunate children in China. They are children who have encountered natural disasters or man-made disasters, lost their parents at an early age, or been abandoned and are wandering around. These unfortunate children should receive widespread sympathy from people.</p>
<p>However, people have not noticed that in addition to these unfortunate children, there are more unfortunate children made by man. That is, when the children's father or mother has an affair, the children's unfortunate fate begins. In the current semi-feudal society, there are not many women who are mothers who have affairs, but it is common for men to do so.</p>
<p>My previous ideal was that a healthy marriage could definitely build a happy family, and that a new generation would be happy and excellent. But reality shattered my ideal. I have personally seen that between friends and relatives, they used to have a long and sweet love process, and their personalities cannot be said to be misunderstood. Moreover, they are both intellectuals who serve society. But after marriage, even after ten or twenty years, when they have "green shades and full branches of children," the hardworking mother is old and her beauty has faded; but the father's career is gradually leading to success. Generally, men who are fickle-minded, with status and money, will find a concubine or mistress. They only see the new person smiling, but they don't hear the old person crying. They don't care about destroying the family's happiness, and they don't experience or think about the psychological impact on the children, because they are becoming more and more distant from the children.</p>
<p>Chinese women, who have always been influenced by traditional rituals and teachings, even those who have been baptized by new ideas, will never casually shout for divorce. When she suffers this unexpected blow, the gentle ones will silently entrust their hopes and love to the next generation. But this broken heart that has been stimulated will sometimes become abnormally unreasonable and vent on the children, beating, scolding, and even ignoring them. The children, facing this family shrouded in haze, have inexplicable hatred and jealousy in their innocent and weak hearts. They cannot get the warmth of home, and they lose their great father's love. Their small hearts are being destroyed.</p>
<p>If the mother has a fierce and irritable personality, she will definitely quarrel with her husband, and because she uses retaliatory measures, she will roam outside all day long, using cinemas and dance halls to numb her heart that has lost joy. As a result, these "fatherless and motherless" children are not well-fed and clothed, and they often suffer from hunger and cold in winter. They have no home except to make trouble in the lanes all day long. When they occasionally see their parents, it is either a cold face or a fight. Under such family education, the spiritual and material education that the children receive is perhaps even worse than that of orphans without parents.</p>
<p>If we want to raise an excellent second generation, we must hold the fathers responsible for most of their responsibilities. Fathers should restrain their selfish lust and irrigate the new seedlings with great fatherly love. I also hope that every woman can respect her own personality, strengthen her reason, and not be seduced by men. It is dishonorable and base to be a concubine. It is not protected by law, and it is disdained by women of the new era. What's more, destroying other people's families and harming the second generation of the new China, you are committing crimes that harm society and the community!</p>
<p>We must save these unfortunate children!</p>

<h3>Goethe's Later Years</h3>
<p>— Mai Fo</p>
<p>Thomas Mann and "Lover's Return"</p>
<p>In the history of world literature, there is no giant more brilliant than Goethe. For Chinese readers, who can forget his masterpiece "The Sorrows of Young Werther"? This is an autobiographical novel of his. After its publication, it was as sought after as the paper of Luoyang, and it spread like wildfire. Many young people heartbroken in love committed suicide with a copy of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" in their hands.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1772, at the young age of twenty-two, the young Goethe set off for Wetzlar, a town in central Germany, to do a legal internship at the Imperial Court. At the age of sixteen, he left his hometown of Frankfurt and studied law in Leipzig and Strasbourg. During this period, he fell ill and stayed at home for a while. In Leipzig, he fell in love with Käthchen Schönkopf, and in Strasbourg, he fell passionately for Friederike Brion, both ending in separation. These formed the model for Goethe's early love affairs, separations, and regrets. Now, Goethe arrived in Wetzlar with a large number of poems, plays, sketches, and</p>
<h3>Ideal Wife and Ideal Husband</h3>
<p>— Li Xin</p>
<p>[Editor's Note: In our August 30th issue, Mr. Zhiwei's "My Ideal Wife" was published, outlining the conditions for his future wife. Many readers responded to this issue, and some even requested that their letters be forwarded to Mr. Zhiwei, which shows the urgent interest young friends have in marriage. Here, we have selected a few letters from those received and published them below, which may be helpful for young people hesitating at the crossroads of love.]</p>
<p>When people reach a certain age, choosing a lifelong partner is an important matter; however, everyone has different ideals.</p>
<p>I believe that the ideal husband should possess the following qualities:</p>
<p>A proper appearance and neat attire, but not excessively decorated; not worshiping fashion and rushing to buy glass trouser belts and other such items. This is beauty in appearance.</p>
<p>Not having bad habits such as "smoking," "drinking," "prostitution," and "gambling"; demanding the improvement of "intellect," "physical fitness," "morality," and "[character]" cultivation. This is beauty in nature.</p>
<p>A strong body, a lively spirit, and no potentially hereditary or contagious diseases. This is physiological beauty.</p>
<p>Excellent knowledge, having received at least twelve years of education; being courageous in service, having a spirit of self-sacrifice, and possessing clear judgment and independent thinking. This is beauty in knowledge and behavior.</p>
<p>Only an "ideal husband" can marry an "ideal wife," do you think that's right?</p>
<h3>Not Buying Something</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wei</p>
<p>I sigh at the excessive "self-centeredness" of human nature in this world, which causes all kinds of conflicts and battles, each with its own set of rigid rules, wanting the world to follow and conform to it. Extreme ideologues do not hesitate to use bloodshed to make the world conform to them all at once, but as a result, humanity suffers before it can enjoy the benefits. I am deeply concerned about the issue of marriage, but I am opposed to both sides listing out conditions. Choosing a partner should not be done carelessly, but it is not entirely like buying something.</p>
<h3>A Letter of Self-Recommendation</h3>
<p>— Xu Yeye</p>
<p>Mr. Zhiwei:</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I finally decided to write this letter. In this mountain city where feudal colors are still strong, this move seems almost absurd, but because of this, please do not underestimate it.</p>
<p>Self-introduction:</p>
<p>I am a graduate of a vocational school. I love my work, and I never forget to learn, so that I can better understand the needs of my time.</p>
<p>I dare only say that within my small circle of life, I can handle things calmly.</p>
<p>Regarding the three words "Truth, Goodness, Beauty," would you like to explain them in detail? How can life step into the realm of "Truth, Goodness, Beauty"? However, regardless of these, I want to make life simple, gentle, and without intense charm?</p>
<p>My face is very ordinary! Sir, the women here are very simple, even simpler than your five, six, or seven ideals, and naturally I am no exception.</p>
<p>I can probably manage a small family well.</p>
<p>Traveling is my only hobby.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, regardless of whether there are any major differences with you, I always hope to be friends with you from a different place and of the opposite sex. I have never been to a bustling city, especially Shanghai, which is known as heaven on earth. I would very much like to meet you there. Although I have no contribution to make to you, I can always report on things that are not found in bustling places.</p>

<h3>The Adventures of Sanmao the Soldier (108)</h3>

<h3>Commoner President: Ju Zheng</h3>
<p>— Qiao Zhi</p>
<p>"Short shirt and bare feet, holding a hoe and rake, trimming grass and watering flowers, leisurely and content."</p>
<p>"I was born late and suddenly reached old age, reading through the vicissitudes of life, the sea has become fields. I am ashamed to manage the state, but I fear to burn beans with the same root. The dream of Zhuangzi is confused by butterflies, and the wind and clouds of the Western Regions cry like cuckoos. I am happy that the autumn is high and people are healthy, unknowingly following the great way."</p>
<p>The above is a section from the "Poem on My Sixtieth Birthday" written by Mr. Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, eleven years ago. Currently, the autumn weather is clear and refreshing, and our Mr. Ju is also getting healthier as he gets older. The content of the poem is very consistent with the current environment. Next month, the 20th, will be Mr. Ju's grand 70th birthday celebration. When toasting and writing poems, rereading old works will surely bring many reflections.</p>
<p>The President in a Bungalow</p>
<p>I call Mr. Ju a commoner president because, although he is the noble president, his private life is no different from that of ordinary people. Before the war, he built a residence near Hepingmen in the capital, occupying eleven mu of land. On such a large area, only a few low bungalows were built, which are truly as different as clouds and mud compared to the magnificent and tall Western-style houses of other dignitaries. At that time, the land and house prices totaled only seven thousand yuan. Every time the sun set, inside this house, there was often an old farmer in a short shirt and bare feet, wearing a straw hat, holding a hoe and rake, trimming grass and watering flowers, with a leisurely and content expression on his face. It may be hard to believe, but this old farmer was the dignified President Ju.</p>
<p>Mr. Ju not only likes the life of a farmer, but also considers himself an Australian. On June 14, 1936, he accompanied his wife to Shanghai and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. The registered name was a pseudonym, and the occupation column was filled with the two words "farmer."</p>
<p>Deeply Understands the Art of Living</p>
<p>He dislikes seeing strangers, but is happy to write calligraphy. Whether the person asking for his calligraphy is familiar or unfamiliar, he always responds. He loves to learn horse riding, and his favorite food is tofu.</p>
<p>Mr. Ju is from Guangji, Hubei, with the courtesy name Juesheng. He studied in Japan in his youth. Speaking of Japan, there is a nice story between Mr. Ju and her: when President Sun was running around overseas for the revolution, Mr. Ju followed and lived in Japan. For Mrs. Ju—Ms. Zhong—her compatriot—gave birth secretly, and Mr. Ju was burdened by having children while running around for national affairs. A Japanese friend, Kayanonagatomo, was willing to raise one of his daughters for him. From then on, Miss Ju was raised by a Japanese family and influenced by Japanese education. Twenty years passed in a flash. Mr. Ju was busy serving the country and forgot about this matter. It was not until June 1936 that Miss Ju learned about her background from her adoptive father, Kayanonagatomo, and then returned to China. The reunion of family members was truly indescribably bittersweet.</p>
<p>Mr. Ju currently has one son and three daughters. The eldest daughter is Kayanonagatomo, who lived in Japan in her early years and has married Mr. Zhang Ming. His son, Haoran, graduated from Tsinghua University and the Central Military Academy and is now serving in the military. He participated in front-line combat during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>We want a commoner official, President Ju. The first impression people have of him is: "Living with the common people"; the "officials" we need in the future are also this kind of official. If we have a particularly good feeling for President Ju, the only reason is because "he is a commoner."</p>
