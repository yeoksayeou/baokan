<h3>艾森豪威爾元帥小史　超人的將才第一流外交家</h3>
<p>轉戰歐陸擊敗强大德軍的盟國遠征軍最高統帥艾森豪威爾將軍，是美國德薩斯州一個農民和工程師的兒子，弟兄共六人，幼年時所度的完全是美國小村鎭的生活，種植菜蔬，飼養小鷄榨取牛奶。</p>
<p>曾任工人和看牛人</p>
<p>在亞比玲高等學校畢業之後，這位美國最偉大軍事領袖之一的將領，曾經充任工人，看牛人，甚至當過職業棒球員，後來進人西點大學，但是功課並不出色，曾因玩足球而傷足。</p>
<p>一九一五年畢業後，他獲得少尉軍銜，派到德薩斯州一個步兵機關服務，數月後當墨西哥邊境發生事變的時候，他擔任民團敎練。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰的時候，艾卹留在美國　任敎練，起先是在一個軍官學校，後米又在坦克學校負擔同樣職務，直至將要休戰前，地　被派到法國去。</p>
<p>在上次大戰與此次戰事的期內，他曾經在麥克阿瑟充任參謀總長的時候，擔任麥帥的助手，後來麥帥調赴菲島，他也隨同前往，任職五年之久，並儿在公餘之暇，練習飛行，一九四〇年艾帥返至美國，歷任各職，一九四一年美陸軍演習，艾帥充分表現其材幹，終於由上校擢升爲淮將。</p>
<p>一九四一年十二月七日，日木偸襲珍珠港五天之後，艾帥奉馬歇爾之召，回到華盛頓，充任參謀部作戰計劃組主任，爲各戰塲擬定偉大戰略，不久他又被委爲歐州美軍司令，赴倫敦工作，獲得英方之合作與讚許。</p>
<p>統率盟軍法國登陸</p>
<p>一九四二年十一月八日，美軍在艾帥指揮下在北非登陸，艾帥此時奔走前綫，備極勞苦。一九四三年二月六日，北非英美軍隊聯合爲一，他充任盟軍總司令，解放北菲，並指揮盟軍在義大利本土登陸。</p>
<p>一九四三年十二月，當義大利戰事在順利進行的時候，他被委爲歐洲盟軍最高統帥，執行有史以來最偉大的軍事任務，終於一九四四年六月六日統率盟軍，在法國沿海岸登陸，越過法境，直搗德國心臟，迫使納粹德國投降，距離盟軍開始進攻，爲時僅十一個月。</p>
<p>同年十一月他繼馬歇爾元帥之後，充任參謀總長之職，關於他就任新職後的作風和活動，紐的時報海外週刋曾有下面的紀載：</p>
<p>艾森豪威爾將軍最近繼馬歇爾將軍之後，祖任這全國陸軍最高的職位，他的豐功偉績，巳可永垂不朽，歐洲勝利的獲得，他在戰略戰術上負有決定作用，這已是無人置疑的事實。如果還需要提一個最後的證據的話，那末前德國參謀本部幕僚在紐倫堡戰罪法庭上說得很明白，使驕傲而強大的第三帝國屈膝的最大因素非他，即艾森豪威爾超人的將才是。</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥繼任人</p>
<p>杜魯門總統有次向一位訪客說過，他認爲文森豪威爾「是我們的第一流外交家」，總統所以選定他作爲馬歇爾的繼任者，　一點重要認識，定很有關係，因爲在今後幾個片以至幾年的時間中，如何應付人民，如向排除美國軍事政策上的矛盾與紊亂，實在是參謀總長主要的工作，而美國陸軍今後顯然在世界大局中，將担負一椿從未經歷的重任，其性質外交的成份，自然遠多於備戰的成分。</p>
<p>身負參謀長重責的艾森豪威爾將軍須克盡兩重廣泛的任務，第一是除了「統轄陸軍」這當然工作以外，他須對有關軍事的一切政策，向陸軍部長，總統與國會提供建議。第二，他須負責執行今後陸軍方面確立或專行的政策。他堅持在他顧問職權以內的事，他要有爭辯與異議的權利，但對業已確立而須他執行的政策，他認爲認眞執行，不置可吾，是他的責任。</p>
<p>陸軍方面所有重要行動與決定，都以參謀總長的名義施行，因此每一項重要決定，殷後考慮的責任，就在他的身上，自然這事情牽涉的範圍很廣泛，那麽些復雜的問題，（而且不少高度技術性的）都要他衡量與作決斷，是不可能的事情因此一套日常工作，就非常重要。</p>
<p>處理問題英明果斷</p>
<p>在他任職最初幾星期內，許多事情都已由他的幕僚加以整理，設法簡化，他們對艾公處理複雜問題的英明果斷，都一致讚揚。</p>
<p>但每天他處理的問題中最大的一個莫如復員，他已指令幕僚從事硏究，以便明瞭問題中最危險的一環是什麽。他注意着美國部隊解散到何種程度，才使軍事上顯露弱點，到什麼程度美國將喪失威望，以及對世界其他各地秩序與安定的影響，這種安定秩序，原由大戰中以重大犧牲換來。</p>
<p>艾森豪威爾要阻止過渡的復員，要减消人們對國會「還我孩兒」的嚴重壓迫，必需竭盡他所有的將才與外交手腕，這一點可由他就戰以後對他一位幕僚的一段談話證明。</p>
<p>「我們打這次仗，並非爲維持現狀，而是使若干糟糕的景象改好，如果我不相信個强大的美國，是對世界和平最大的貢獻，目前的工作，我至多幹五分鐘」。</p>

<h3>長江水閘計劃成功後　海輪可直達重慶　發電可灌漑鄂省農田千萬畝</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本戰犯的開審</h3>
<p>審訊日本戰犯的國際法庭業於本月三日在東京開庭，受審日本戰犯案件，這次受審的日本戰犯爲數二十有八，包括自東條，土肥原，烟俊六等以次，一時是戰時日本的斯要人物。他們從前發號施令侵略我們中國，發動太平洋戰事，如今都俯首作階下囚，聽候這國際法庭的審判。在這二十八個被吿之中，幾乎全部是侵略中國的元兇；祇要一看這批戰犯的名單，那一個不曾在對中國的侵略上有過兇毒的一手：東條英機，土肥原賢二，畑俊六，平沼騏一郞，廣田弘毅。中國受日本的侵略歷時最久，爲吿最烈，對於道些戰犯的受審，自然較他國更爲關切。這次國際法庭在東京的開審我國法官梅汝璈博士所占的席位僅次於審判長，可見其它各國如何了解中國在審訊日本戰犯中所占的地位。我們八年的血戰，不，簡直是五十年來所受的恥辱，如今在國際法庭的開審湔雪了。所以關於日本戰犯的審訊，我們應該特別予以注意。</p>
<p>這次國際法庭自五月三日開庭，賡續至六日經審判長宣布退庭至六月三日再行開庭正式審判。這次國際法庭的開庭爲時僅三日，其意義在宣吿這法庭的正式成立，接受審訊日本戰犯案件，到庭各戰犯均異口回聲，宣稱「無罪，」繼續公開審判，須待至六月三日以後。在這一個月的時問內，國際法庭各法官得以充分研究檢察官所提出的起訴書；庶幾於下次公開審訊時，得以充分明瞭起訴的要點。在國際法庭開庭的三日間，這受審的一個塲面，我們看見有聯合社記者的描述：「日本戰爭禍首今日受審時，企岡施展其慣用之狡猾手段，爲自身生命爭辯。此種手段雖爲二十年前攫取政權時相彷彿，但詐術依舊，而昔日之權力已不存在。若輩對於被控一連串令人痛惡之罪狀，供稱「不服，」其情狀亦如昔日之夜郞自大，渺視一切然。無如此輩形容枯耗，衣服擁腫，已不復善吠，即慣於發號施令之聲調，如傲慢的大島浩，或崛強的佐藤賢了之類於「無罪」兩字出口，亦使聽者不起作用。」對於國際法庭檢察官的起訴書，我們未曾讀到其原文，自無從加以論列，但以如此侵略的元兇，而對於起訴各點聲稱「無罪，」這固然不在我們的意料外，但各犯希圖以狡猾手段，洗刷其應得之罪，愈足以顯出他們的一副猙獰面目。以他們所犯罪行之嚴重，國際法庭於訊結後。應處他們以應得之刑，是毫無問題的事。不過以往三日問的庭審，郤頗有値得我們注意的地方。</p>
<p>値得我們注意的地方是：（一）東條約辯護律師質難國際法庭之權限；（二）東條等戰犯岡以日本作戰爲「自衛」的藉口，逃避所負的責任；（三）指出投擲原子彈爲「謀殺，」企岡减輕其罪狀。東條約辯護律師如何質難國際法庭的權限，新聞報道語焉不詳，我們迄未窺其全貌。但這問題旣被提出，其可能包括的範圍或不在小；如法庭的存在本身是否爲合法；法庭的權力如何，是否有權受理此等案件，以及據電訊所傳，法官之曾經實地調查日本罪行者，已有偏見的存在，應否迴避等等，這些看上去好像都是純法理的問題，其作用或在推翻法庭本身的存在，或在限制法庭的權力，以冀根本推翻這批戰犯的受審。凡此所爲，俱爲日本狡猾成性的表現。我們若一加追究，便毫無法理上的依據。對於這些所謂法理之爭，將來法庭重開，必有明白的宣吿，自不待言。我們以第三者的立塲，對於這些爭點的看法是：日本旣接受波茨坦的宣言無條件投降，麥克阿瑟元師以盟軍最高統帥的資格進據日本，即日本的天皇亦要受其管轄；這次國際法庭的產生係根據麥帥的指令，自爲合法的機構，具有審訊日本戰犯的充分權力。東條等辯護律師所提各點，毫無理由。</p>
<p>戰犯的審訊與處刑，原有兩說：其一以爲一國作戰係一國遂行其國策的必然延續：戰爭原爲國策衝突的必然結果；所以軍政首長旣爲國家的公僕不負法律上的責任。據此說，則所謂「戰犯」這個名詞都還有間題，其另一說，則以爲一國的作戰，決定於軍政首長私意者多，決定於人民公意者少，特別是侵略性的戰爭：據比，則「戰犯」負有對內與對外的兩重法律責任。侵略他國，破壞和平，應負國際法的責任，役使人民作戰，應負對內的法律責任。這次世界大戰旣是侵略性的全面戰爭，則掀起此次戰事的主要人物，都應該以「戰犯」受法律的制裁，那自然是毫無問題的事。由於這次戰犯的受到法律制裁，加强了國際法治的觀念，爲以後的國際關係立下了嚴正的規範。我們若放縱了侵略戰的元兇而不予法律制裁，則誰能再尊該國際法的尊嚴！因此，日本的戰犯，是必須嚴加法辦的。</p>
<p>現在日本的戰犯是在開始受審了。國際法庭的各法官都是各該國的法學權成，對於這些掀起戰事的戰犯，自將嚴正審判，何待多言。我們覺得遺憾的是這次受審的戰犯雖達二十八人，但仍有不少侵略元兇及帮兇自今尙逍遙法外。天皇之應吾視爲戰犯，那是另一問題，今且不談。若阿部信行，若綾川吉亮，或則參與對華戰事，或則假手軍閥，開發我東北資源以供侵略之用，都是罪無可逭的人。對於他們，亦應同樣予以法律制裁，庶幾參加侵略的人都能繩之以法；將來世界持久和平的確保，方克有濟。我們相信國際法庭的檢察官必能對這些參加侵略的兇犯，個個都能處之以法。那是對於持久和平的確保很有關係的。</p>

<h3>印軍總司令　抵西姆拉</h3>
<p>圓桌會今日重開</p>
<p>前途仍未許樂觀</p>
<p>〔中央社西姆拉六日電〕消息靈通方面人士因認印軍總司令歐慶萊克將軍之行抵西姆拉，及渠昨夜會晤總督，極具意議。會談內容，今後自不致予以發表，然政治分析家指陳，就此一事而論，會談可能商及下列兩項問題，（一）假定三方會商不能商獲結果，騷亂即將繼而發生，果爾印軍地位即極重要，蓋維持治安秩序，終爲印軍之責任也。</p>

<h3>各政黨成見益深　日政局懸而不決　爭奪政權使麥帥漸感不耐鳩山有被列入戰犯之可能</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京八日電〕權威人士今日披露：麥帥總部愼密調查結果，或許日自由黨總裁鳩山，即將被控爲戰爭犯，而執行日政治肅淸工作之日方官員，則將被削除資格。日本政局久懸不決，以及日政府迄未全力執行肅淸工作兩事，麥帥現已漸覺惱怒。同時，日政界首腦力圖解決黨派糾紛，以便組織新閣，已歷多日，至今似反而成見益深，組閣希望竟與幣原內開亂域時同樣渺茫。此外，麥帥總部並嚴密查究內閣書記長楢橋之過去活動，查究結果，或將削除其出任公職之資格。總部觀察家與日本人民成認政局僵持，乃因政治首腦各岡爭奪舊時權力所致。</p>
<h3>自由黨重整旗鼓</h3>

<h3>從事原子彈試驗人員　自美赴比基尼島　試驗艦隊亦啓程開馬紹爾羣島</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山七日合衆電〕從事原子彈公開試騐人負，今日分乘三船，離加里福尼亞各港，首途前往今夏試騐原子彈之比基尼。該批人員中包括各種科學專家，渠等將測量原子彈百萬度之熱度，驚人之壓力，及劇烈之輻射作用。美國陸海軍特種部隊試騐原子彈所乘之試騐艦隊七十四艘船艦，已啓程赴馬紹爾羣島，其中包括造成已三十年之戰艦「內華達號，該艦塗以鮮明之橘黃色，將爲七月一日左右舉行第一次試騐時之目標。第二次之水面試騐，或水下試騐，將在第一次試騐後之三週內舉行。</p>
<p>美決邀請各國屆時參觀試驗</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜今日宣稱：比基尼珊瑚島試騐原子彈時，擬邀請參加聯合國原子能委員會國家，如蘇·英·中·法·加·澳·巴西。埃及·墨西哥。荷蘭·及波蘭等國派代表及新聞界參觀。艾氏並鄭重聲明，雖邀請各國參觀，但就試騐整個言之，此僅係美國政府之計　，並非一聯合或國際性之試騐。</p>
<p>試驗延期原因各方揣測不一</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統已將比基尼島原子炸彈試騐之日期協五月十五展延至七月一日自行各國初以爲美國此舉係爲世界和平起見，延期結果可使聯合國機構有更多之機會消滅世人對於又一次大戰之恐懼。國會中甚至有人主張取消試騐，以爲浪費一億金元，轟沉艦船百艘，以證明原子炸彈爲破壞力最大之武器，實屬毫無意義。但軍事科學家指出，延期之另一可能原因，爲新的紀錄儀器尙待創製，試騐計劃亦容有變更。</p>
<p>投入水底之彈將以纜索繫住</p>
<p>試騐時第二個原子彈原定在水面爆發，今擬改在水中爆炸，據專家意見：在珊瑚礁環抱之淺水中爆炸，與實地轟炸一停泊之艦隊更爲近似一枚在廿五呎至五十呎深處爆發之炸彈，猶如潛艇安放之遲延爆炸水雷，或飛機投擲之超深水炸彈。比基尼珊瑚礁有幾處深　一百八十呎，實行此項計劃時，將以纜索繫住炸彈，懸於舟艇之下，以定時信管引起爆炸，屆時在水面上轟然爆發，將起絕大震動，定使船身陂裂。專家謂此項變更當可採納。但預定之第三個實騐則不致右何變更，仍擬使其在海洋深處爆炸</p>
<p>美科學家發現馴伏原子方法</p>
<p>美國科學家已發現一馴伏原子的方法，使鐠與鈾二三五不復能用以製造炸彈，而祗能作工業上之用。各國共管原子秘密之外交上困難，或可因此打開，商業上利用原子能之時期，亦可早日實現。據聞錯於失去爆炸效能後，即不易恢復原來之性質。美參議院原子能委員會某議員稱：若此種「變性」可以付諸實施，原子秘密共管問題即「大爲簡單」，若能嚴格管制一切可分裂物質之供應，加以處理，使軍事上無法利用，對於原子炸彈之秘密製造即無須畏懼。委員會又曾硏究國務院之建議，創立一種國際特許制度，以管制原料及原子能之生產。</p>

<h3>英策略重大決定　駐埃及英軍　開始撤退　首批軍實運抵海發全部撤盡需時五載</h3>
<p>〔路透社海發八日電〕英軍現已開始退出埃及，第一批重軍器昨已由英艦「鄧可萊培根自埃及運抵海發，今後數月內將續有船隻，經常以軍械運至此問。本社倫敦外交訪員認爲英國宣佈願放棄埃及一事，實爲英國所曾採取最重大之戰略決定，此因迎合埃及主機獨立之願望及調整帝國在中東交通安全關係，故作此決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社偷敦七日電〕今晚據極有資格方面觀測，埃及地位實爲不列顚帝國東西兩部份問戰略的連鎖，英軍欲自埃及完全退出，至少需時五載。英國撤兵之議，並非謂此事在一年半載內即可完成。據某專家說明，就物資上言，即使現在立刻開始撤兵，至少需時五年，方能將陸海軍設備完全撤除，軍隊全部退出。運輸所有設備，須用每列十五輛至二十輛之火車七百列。</p>

<h3>德國投降一週紀念　追述納粹的興亡　本報編譯室特輯</h3>
<p>去年昨日—五月八日—德國正式宣佈無條件投降，結束了二次世界大戰的前半部。把德國從興起到敗亡十二年中盛衰典亡的演變，作一概括的追述，使我們看淸讀武主義者的來踨去跡，這樣來紀念德國投降一週年，想是很有意義的事情吧。</p>
<p>一九三三年一月三十日德國總統興登堡任命希特勒爲德國的總理，他假借「國會縱火」事件，把一切異已份子一鼓肅淸。興登堡逝世以後，他便一躍而爲德國的元首。</p>
<p>希特勒登台以後，積極推動重整備軍的工作。一九三五年三月希特勒突然宣佈不承認凡爾賽和的裏關於德國軍備的規定，同時宣佈恢復德國的徵兵制度。</p>
<p>一九三六年三月七日德國突然進軍萊茵河區，五月五日阿京陷落，十月廿四日德意締結軸心同盟。十一月十七日德日簽訂反共同盟，不久墨索里尼也加上了名字。</p>
<p>一九三八年三月十一日希特勒向奧國提出了一紙哀的美敦書，要求德揆舒斯尼格辭職，兩天以後，由奧國國，社黨魁殷瓜特出任總揆，宣佈與德國合併，希特勒不血刃而滅掉了一個國家。</p>
<p>希特勒懷了想　　　　　　心，用威脅利誘的手段，於同年十月一日和英法簽訂了慕尼黑協定，墨索里尼也以中間人的身份簽了字，於是希特勒又兵不血刃的解除一個國家的自衛力量。</p>
<p>一九三九年三月十四日德軍把捷克全部佔領，捷克就此滅亡。</p>
<p>同年八月二十三日突然宣佈了德蘇互不侵犯協定，波蘭的地位就此動搖起來。九月一日德軍大舉侵入波蘭，歷史上空前慘酷的戰爭—第二次世界大戰—便這樣開始了。</p>
<p>九月三日，英國根據英波兩國簽訂的軍事同盟，立即對德宣戰，法國也跟着宣戰。九月二十七日華沙陷落。</p>
<p>一九四〇年四月九日，德軍侵入丹麥·挪威·五月十日德軍侵入荷蘭·比利時及盧森堡。邱吉爾就在此時繼張伯倫而爲英國首相。</p>
<p>五月二十九日，英軍自鄧扣克撤退，這是英國在戰爭初期遭遇到的慘禍。</p>
<p>義大利墨索里尼乘火打刦，於六月十日對英法宣戰。法國的美麗國都—巴黎—於六月十四日就陷落在德軍手裏。六月二十二日，貝當和德國在康導森林簽訂停戰協定，法國便這樣向德國投降了。</p>
<p>德國征服法國以後，編續向區洲的其他部分侵略：一九四一年四月十六日，德軍侵入南斯拉夫及希臘；六月二十二日，德軍侵入蘇聯，德蘇戰爭從此開始；十二月六日德軍進抵莫斯科郊外三十里處，蘇軍就在緊要關頭發動大規模的反攻，到一　四一年一月底時，蘇軍已把德軍迫退到三個月以前的戰綫上去</p>
<p>一九四三年一月底蘇聯宣佈消滅進攻史達林格勒的全部德軍。五月十三日北非戰事結束，德軍全部投降。七月十二日蘇軍全綫開始　反攻，自後節節進逼，勢如破竹。一九四四年一月四日蘇軍越過舊波蘭東境，四月二日攻入羅馬尼亞，六月四日解放羅馬，同時美國飛機開始穿梭轟炸德國。</p>
<p>同年八月二十三日羅馬尼亞對德宣戰，八月二十五日巴黎解放，九月十一日美軍攻入德境，從九月二十二日到十月二十五日，蘇軍依次攻入愛沙尼亞，匈牙利，拉塔維亞，捷克，東普魯士及挪威。</p>
<p>一九四五年二月四日至十一日，羅斯福總統，邱吉爾首相和史達林委員長會晤於克里米亞半島的雅爾達，決定了解決德國諸問題的原則。</p>
<p>同年二月十三日，蘇軍佔領匈京布達佩斯；三月二十一日，薩爾區德軍被肅淸。</p>
<p>同年四月三日，西綫盟軍開始向德國平原各方面疾進，四月十三日蘇軍佔領維也納，四月十六日西綫盟軍進抵捷境。</p>
<p>四月二十五日蘇軍進抵柏林市區中心，美蘇兩軍在突爾高會師。同時美英蘇三國在舊金山舉行會議討論與決定戰後和平機構的組織規章。</p>
<p>五月一日，墨索里尼被槍決消息證實，同時德國宣佈希特勒死訊，由杜尼茲繼任德國元首。</p>
<p>五月三日，史達林宣佈佔領柏林，盟軍佔領漢堡。同日義火利德軍首先無條件投降。</p>
<p>五月五日，丹麥，荷蘭的德軍也全部投降了。雖然在捷克國境內尙有少數德軍聲言抵抗，但是有組織的戰爭至此實際上已經停止。於是杜尼茲代表德國，於五月七日宣佈無條件投降，當天在盟軍最高統帥艾森豪威爾總部簽訂了降書。五月八日便由英美蘇三國領袖正式宣佈　停戰日，世界大戰至此便吿結束了前半部。</p>
<h3>邸吉爾發表演說　主張與蘇謀諒解　信守聯合國憲章共保安寗否世界人類將再罹浩刦</h3>
<p>〔路透一社倫敦八日電〕英戰時首相邱吉爾昨接受威斯敏斯特郡榮譽公民，並在席次發表演說，敦促藉聯合國械構，與蘇聯謀良好與眞誠之諒解。略謂，有人主張吾人放棄巴勒斯坦，放棄印度，但英人與世人對此舉之後來，須加以深長之考慮，並應注意及如何可使數百萬男女，不再受如歐洲之浩刦。今中國仍受此威脅，其人民痛苦在綿延之中，吾人深望世界熱心人士，皆能信守聯合國機稱及其　章，以達到安寗之終極目的。倘聯合國於制裁法西斯與納粹主義勝利之後，竟復形成兩大社會思想之敵峙狀熊，則其後果將如何，此爲全世界人士所同欲尋覓答案之大問題。倘不獲解答，則人類又將重陷於水深火熱之中，其慘痛之情形將更甚於前。今之最大希望，惟需藉聯合國之組織、與蘇聯謀良好與眞誠之諒解。英語民族與歐西國家共同致力於此，始能挽還此浩刦，拯救世界各國云。</p>

<h3>行總署長蔣廷談　救濟全國糧荒已採緊急措施　以工代賑工人獲最優先權</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院善後救濟總署署長蔣廷　氏，昨接見本市各報社記者，據談，關於「聯總」運抵之救濟物資，中以小麥麵粉兩項，數量較鉅，計有二十萬噸，現因全國各地糧荒嚴重，已採取緊急步驟，水陸趕運，凡災區以工代賑之工人有最高優先權，其次爲難民，再次始爲一般居民之定量分配。記者詢以今後是否繼續在本市拋售麵粉，蔣氏答稱：過去「行總」曾實施無限制拋售，數達七萬噸以上，然實際並不能嘉惠平民，徒使奸商套買胤利而已，故今後決行停止。至於醫藥用品到數甚少，且均係美軍剩餘物資，故參差不齊，現已分配各醫院及敎會醫院。蔣氏繼稱：太署運往各地救濟物資之困難及其費用之浩大，誠非外界所能想像；例如每一「聯總」船隻抵埠，自卸貨入倉迄轉運止，即需款一億元之鉅，又遣送難民回籍，每人每公里爲五十五元，每月支出達十億元。搶修黃河工程費，除供給工具糧食外，業已支出三十億元，預計至七月底，勢將超過一百億元，此項鉅筆支出，唯賴財務廳出售物資彌補。鐵路方面，「行總」已與交通部合作，先從粵漢路開始，船隻方面，「聯總」已代「行總」在美訂購船隻一千艘，其中六百艘爲拖駁，三百艘爲軍運船，短期內當可抵華。又爲發展今後農業，「聯總」已允撥給耕出機二千架，其中四十架已運抵，分撥河南應用。本人在美時曾向美要求配給人造肥料五十萬噸，結果僅允一萬噸，最後記者詢以胡佛氏此次來華考察後，對我國是否能給予更大帮助，蔣氏答稱可能性極大。</p>

<h3>疏濬浦江積淤　挖泥量逐漸增加</h3>
<p>（本報訊）浦江河泥，因八年淤積，河床日高，影響航運匪淺。濬浦局曾於光復後，積極推展疏浚工作。茲據該局副局長施孔懷吿稱：該局四月份在浦江之挖泥量，爲十萬八千噸，較三月份已增加百分之三十。而戰前該局挖泥設備完全時，每月經常之挖泥量爲二十五萬噸，故四月份之挖泥工作，已及戰前百分之四十三。至本月份之挖泥量，可望增加至十二萬五千噸，已及戰前之半。現正積極向京漢兩地關係方面交涉收回該局所有之泥駁船及拖駁等，以便在挖泥設備恢復後，恢復舊觀。蘇州河方面，該局近亦正派員測量，大致在五月底可完成測量工作，然後再定疏浚辦法。</p>

<h3>錯綜複雜環境之下紙商紙廠苦悶萬分　加拿大白報紙供應尙難暢旺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪紙業中人，據吿：兩月來本市紙業情况，平疲慘淡，乏美足陳。本市一般造紙廠，因：（一）煤貴，（二）工錢貴，（三）產品售價不高，（四）實銷有限，（五）外洋定貨續有運到，（六）外帮客銷，因運輸窒礙，等種種打擊之下，已屬奄奄一息。統計本市造紙廠十餘家，停工者已達半數以上。論紙品存底，並不豐厚，然因實銷有限，市况亦未見挺秀，外洋定貨雖時有運到，然運期不定，到貨亦屬不多，故執貨者，亦有目爲奇貨，扳持不售。處此種種矛盾之環境中，一般紙商紙廠，均感苦悶萬分。至白報紙之進口，過去以加拿大居多，太平洋戰後，加拿大原屬運銷我國之紙商，紛紛移轉目光於美國，其中不乏與美國訂有五年十年之長期承購合同者，故目前對我國白報紙之供應，自不能舒暢。即或有之，亦屬供應美國之剩餘品，且多屬廿一吋半以下之白報紙。據吿：加拿大所產白報紙，佔全球白報紙產量百分之七十，戰後生產量，並未視戰前有顯著之减少，惟需要量却急遽增加。現估計加拿大所產白報紙，百分之八十係供美國應用，設美國產紙情形好轉，則加拿大對我國之供應量，亦可望增加。惟此項期望，需至明年，始有端倪。一方面佔計國內白報紙之需要量，則每月的需三萬噸。</p>

<p>（本報訊）上海地方法院受理之美人第一件犯罪案，即美商船古利號水手宛達，於四月八日在永定路十二弄十一號李瑞根所設妓院前，刀傷美籍黑人司潑羅斯致死案。昨日下午二時正，仍由孟庭長庭柯曁書記官魏冀徵，檢察官曹鴻，開刑一庭二度審訊。由司法警官張驥。潘祝鵬提被吿到庭。審判長問：「你有否殺死司潑羅斯之心？」答：「沒有。」問：「上次提訊時，你說是爲了自衛，你有有利的證據嗎？」答：「因司潑羅斯已刺傷了珂尼，而我的外衣亦被他刺破二層，覺得他有危險性，所以是爲自衛而刺他二刀。」問：「當時你怎麼刺的？」答：「他第一刀刺來，被我跳避，又用左手平舉小刀，將再行刺，我便用左手把他胸衣扭住，右手拿住刺刀，把他的左手挾在我的左手腋下，然後用右手述續刺他二刀，一刀刺在背上，另一刀大約刺在肩上。」間：「你們相刺的時候有人在旁嗎？」答：「我不曾看見有人。」孟庭長乃傳訊證人白朗，彼在該妓院內過宿一夜，曾耳聞彼等吵架。繼傳美海軍副官兼海軍醫師茂飛，據稱，被害人於是日晚十一時四十分上船，已暈迷不省人事，至十二時左右，即去世。其致命傷在左前胸第三條肋骨上，刀鋒深入心臟；其他四處創傷，則決不能致人於死。後又傳證珂尼·李瑞根（妓院女主人）與胡科明（住百老匯六一九號，美國飯店之工頭，曾見彼等打架而鳴警者。）諸證人，供述彼等所見，即宣吿開始辯論。首由檢查官宣讀起訴書，並解說被吿犯罪之行爲，嗣由指定辯護人桂中樞律師起立，提呈辯護狀，即行辯論，略謂被吿刺人之動機有二：（一）因見回伴之被刺，激於義憤；（二）因司潑羅斯之行刺，起而自衛。至於追打被害人，乃以被吿心中所存之義憤未息之故，並以美國法庭所判之類似案件，提出作證。繼稱，被吿年僅二十二歲，應是在大學讀書之時，奈以家境不好，少受教育；加以甫經大戰，好鬥之心未滅，行爲難免過激，而兩次審訊，被吿卒未狡辯，可見爲人忠厚，故請鈞院體念其動機與苦衷，宣判無罪。審判長室吿辯論終結，定十四日下午二時宣判。</p>

<h3>高院昨再審沙里　法籍七證人證言均有利於被告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕被控通敵之前法租界驚務處副總巡兼政治部長沙里，昨由高院再度開庭審訊。當上次開　時，因高院依據法令，不允被吿接見辯護律師，致　被吿拒絕答供。昨晨由曹推事再度審訊時，因被吿已先與看護人艾振麟晤談，故一改前次之傲慢態度，對法官所問一一回答。庭上詢問被吿年齡籍貫一過後，即訊法籍證人七名。而此七人之證言，俱對被吿有利。曹推事審訊完畢，即諭改期再訊，被吿還押。</p>
<h3>慘絕人寰之敵寇暴行　江陰大屠殺案罪魁定期開審　下田次郎罪大惡極</h3>
<p>江陰大屠殺案罪魁前江陰日憲丘隊軍曹下田次郞，業經第一綏靖區司令部上海軍事法庭軍事檢察官偵訊完畢。昨日提起公訴。軍事法庭將於十五日下午三時公開審訊。查被吿下田次郞，係江陰日憲兵隊軍曹，在職數年，異常兇惡，尤以性好殘殺，當地人民被殺害者，不知凡幾。與同隊中會長齋籐勝司二人，稱爲二大殺人魔王江陰人民，畏之如虎，至今提及，猶有餘悸。上年八月中旬，敵軍投降，江陰日憲兵隊獲訊後，擬先行撤離，維時該隊尙羈押我被捕同胞十六人，不特未立予釋放，反決定將其中十三人處死。同月十五日晚十二時許，將汪忠誠·許鎭方·楊醒農·石阿康·瞿宗眞·趙浩生·顧明·陸永·林阿春·陸阿才·張進修·山東人（不知姓名）及章郁仁十三人，由獄中提出，雙手反　，排立廣塲；此十三人中，多數係我抗戰同志，見此情形，自分必死，於臨刑前大呼口號，高唱國歌，慷慨赴難，以示不屈，先由齊藤勝司動手執鋒利腰刀，向被害者胸部猛刺，刀刺入再用力一旋後拔出即登時斃命。如斯連續剌斃七人至第八人，係一靑年，於齋藤勝司舉刀時出其不意，大呌一聲，齋藤勝司受驚，手軟不能加刃，廢然而去。繼之者爲一兵長，上前先用刀將此靑年之頭割下，代爲洩憤，復又如齋藤勝司之法，刺死二人；其刺第二人，將刀拔出時，因有血隨刀噴射，遂亦中止他去。乃由被吿下田次郞接續行兇，亦如法刺斃二人。輸至刺第十三人章郁仁時，被吿因與之相識，見塲中餘人已退，遂用足將其踢入塲旁則所內，使之隱避，以全其命。該日憲兵隊於同月十七日晨，撤離江陰，章郁仁得獲生還。該隊隊長永岡春義。及齊藤勝司，事後均畏罪潛逃，被吿在無錫被我軍扣留，解由京滬衛戍總司令部轉送法庭偵查經傳喚章郁仁到庭，就其所目擊身歷實况指陳歷歷，當以被吿實有戰爭罪犯嫌疑，應負殺人罪責，故即依法提起公訴云</p>
<h3>分配房屋委員會　討論分配原則　不合法申請機關提出取消</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院分配房屋委員會，昨晟九時舉行第五次會議，到錢主任委員大鈞。副主任委員黃伯樵·委員徐寄廎·查良鑑·宋思一等，其他委員均因公滯京，未及趕回，故昨日會議，僅就有關分配原則問題，彼此交換意見。各委員根據「必須在滬辦事之中央機關」爲分齟原則，將申請房　之機關中不合法者提出取消。至可能配給房屋之各機關則保留其申請書，由調查組詳細調查，再經委員會審核後配與房屋。此項審核手續，尙須經數次會議後方可決定。</p>
<p>調查嚴密</p>
<p>分配工作乃係最後之步驟，該會五調查小組，於本月一日起，已分別至各屋業主及現住機關人員處調查，調查手續頗爲週密，必須將該屋房簡數目，大小，所居人數以及以前所居何處，詳細記載，以後分配時，即可依此爲據，按實際需要分配。聞調查情形相當順利，被調查各戶亦頗能合作。惟因調查工作，極爲複雜，本月內尙不能結束，故實施分配，亦非短期內可完成。</p>
<p>該會於前日已截止收納申請及登記文件，計業主呈報者共六百件，機關申請者共一五五六件。</p>
<p>勒遷四起</p>
<p>昨據該會負責方面發表，該會對非法强佔房屋者，其執行勒遷命令第一號至第四號，業已發出，初由執行人員予以勸吿，然後即強制執行。此四起命令，計滬西區某兩住宅，及虹口區兩巨宅，內中一宅，聞係巨奸陳春圃前所居住者，迄至昨晚消息，此項執行命令，均獲被執行人接受，依法遷讓，圓滿解決，遣屋由該會查封維持現狀，靜候統一分配。</p>

<p>前日下午湖南旅滬同鄉會假座新生活俱樂部召開湘災急賑會議，鄙人忝爲湘人一分子，於百忙中抽空前往參加，會中有最近由湘抵滬之供職聯總專作救濟調查工作之同鄉某君報吿湘災實况：謂目前三湘人民無屋可住，無衣可着，即素稱「魚米之鄉」的湖南，因田園荒廢，亦無飯可吃，米價之高，令人咋舌！多以樹皮草根及觀音土充饑，所採野草以供食者已達數十種之多，均由聯總美籍職員攝有標本照片帶滬，至於出賣子女以圖在死亡錢上掙扎者之慘聞，到處可見，與會同鄉幾無不聞之而聲淚俱下。刻正發起募捐運動，當塲認捐者頗爲踴躍，惟念我旅滬湘胞，爲數頗多，似應本敬恭桑梓之義務，有錢出錢有力出力，如蒙捐款，請送天津路二六〇號（山西路西首）復興實業銀行代收，以資急賑，再者凡同情我湘災情而願樂捐者，亦不勝聲香壽祝之至。張遠昕通訊處北京路一五一號電話一七〇五八</p>

<h3>神奇偉大　無綫電展覽會表演各種器械</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國業餘無綫電協會上海分會，爲引起社會人士對無綫常科學之興趣，及造就吾國無綫電人才起見，特於前日起至十二日止，假震旦大學禮堂舉行無綫電展覽會。昨日下午五時半，特由亞美股份有限公司經理蘇祖國，中國理化電器製造廠經理朱松齡，及各會員招待記者實地表演，並詳解各種器械，精彩異常，深覺無綫電科學之神奇偉大。</p>
<p>展覽會陳設各機械，一部份係借自美新聞處及航空公司等。有航空無綫電手搖及自動尋向器，可在百英里左右，利用地面各地電台尋找方向，且能這獲秘密電台。判別器在此次大戰中發明，裝置秘密，可分辨自機及敵機。自機發出信號後，在十秒鐘後即能回映，否則即係敵機。爲避免敵機仿製，免陷陰謀起見，此器內置有炸彈一枚，一旦被敵察用，即可爆炸毁滅。運輸機中裝設雷達，在十英里內，可明察敵機，防止迫近，此器乃利用鏡子反射原理，視顯影器上之光點，推測敵機距離。</p>
<p>盲目着陸儀器，由指示器及收訊器構造而成，與地面跑道端發音機相應後，不論在黑夜或雲務中，均可辨認方向，此機在中國地面尙無設備。航程儀器可視電波强弱，測定飛機所處位置。高度計內裝置收發報機，可自動指示飛機距離地面之高度。指揮器及交通器均可在機上通話。交通器發報及收音，可達五百英里以上。傳眞接收機可將於極遠距離外之書報傳影。傳影化學紙前面係白蠟塗成，後面刷以金屬，中爲炭質，利用波動，立即傳字，黑白分明。</p>
<p>最饒趣味者，乃鋼絲錄音器，每卷鋼絲長二萬呎，細似髮絲，分繞左右兩圈，中經磁石，撥動機紐，綱絲返轉時，即可發音，如通過另一吸磁石後，即可擦去聲音，故鋼絲可繼續不斷應用。若欲留存言音，可保留達二十年之久。此機在美發明，現售每只美金一千元，目前中國僅此一架。正由科學家陳德良君硏究仿製。</p>
<p>各業餘家自備業餘電台，可隨時對話，遠達南美洲各國，藉此互通音訊，自我介紹，便利之至。將來普遍設置，對於傳遞全球消息，融合世界友情，其功績將更奇妙偉大矣。</p>

<h3>鐵道管理學校北平校舍被佔</h3>
<p>新院長徐佩琨尙未到院</p>
<p>〔本報重慶訊〕北平鐵道管理學院，自敎部准許獨立後，全院師生，莫不興奮，由全院同學組成之平院遷院協進會，正積極展開遷院工作，雖經各方校友努力協助，惟困難尙多。而該院在北平之校舍，未能順利接收，尤爲困難中之焦點。綠該院院會，在淪陷期間，由敵僞佔據，勝利後，即被航委會第十區空軍司令部北平修理廠佔用，雖經院方派員赴平交涉，迄今未有結果。據該廠表示，平院房屋，由該廠係自敵僞手中接收而來，並非事後佔用，該廠原擬設於南苑，茲因該地爲美軍租用，致不能遷間該地，一俟美于軍撤離，當可將平院騰讓云。又新任院長徐佩琨氏，尙無來院就任消息，而遷院工作，亟待徐氏主持，全院師生，急電徐氏請其早日來院。（金）</p>

<h3>唐山工學院遷校　旅費有限學生須自行設法返唐</h3>
<p>〔本報璧山訊〕唐山工學院復員委員會之遷校工作，已由計劃至實行階段。各組幹事，已分別聘定。遷校旅費，亦已分配：計簡任者，每人得十八萬四千元；　任者，每人得十七萬七千元；委任者，每人得十五萬元；學生每人十萬五千元，另發貸金二月計一萬五千元。此項旅費，部方核准之數，祇及實際所需之一半，故院方令學生自行設法返唐。一部份經濟確係困難，或家在解放區之學生，對院方此舉，頗爲驚駭，曾數度進謁院長，請院方考慮學生之處境，迄未得圓滿答覆。現學生方面，已組織隨校北返同學會，決向院方力爭，並擬向有關各方呼籲，要求學校携帶北返。又訊：唐院下學期定九月廿三日註册，十月一日正式上課，本年度新生，決在北平天津及上海三地招考。關於下學年公費問題，成爲各校學生切身之問題，據重慶西南日報訊：部方本擬取消，後因特種原因，特延長至本年年底，惟尙未經官方證實。（緘）</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦八日電〕英國駐華大使館前任文化專負浦樂道氏，日昨在倫敦中國恊會發表演說，講題爲「中英文化關係」。渠强調英國應鼓勵英國舉生硏習中國語文，中國藝衛。音樂·文學·及哲學·藉以促進對華之瞭解。浦氏演辭共分三段，並描述中英兩國人民之生活方式，如何彼此相互影響，中英兩國愈有加緊其關係之必要，惟紙有彼此瞭解其背景，然後始可成功。中英兩國人民實有自然之親愛，醫業已建立之制度，互有尊敬之心，對償人品格均有信心，且均有詼　之感。不幸二　人民問相互之　觸，究　過少。原因之一。在於二國距　太遠，且英人之能講華語者寥寥可數，而能閱讀中國報章，章　普通信件，更屬絕無僅有。反之，中國藝術。文學·及哲學，則殊　英人之硏究。而英人爲公之精神，賣足爲中國人士之借鏡。人類之前途，實依賴各民族聞信心之建立。中英關係之加强，即爲孔子所云「四海之內皆兄弟」一言之實現。</p>

<h3>滬大前校長樊正康　赴美考察敎育</h3>
<p>昨晨已乘機首途</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕　江六學係美國浸禮會設立，於今四十載，聲譽卓著，自民十五年起，該校遵照中國敎育法令，改聘華人劉湛恩據士爲校長，樊正康爲敎務長，十餘年來，舉凡校舍設備之增建，組織課程之改訂，學生思想之訓練，莫不殫精竭慮，運籌規劃，始有今日之規積。抗戰軍興，滬市淪陷，劉校長忠貞不屈，領導抗日工作，不幸於廿八年四月七日爲國犧牲。該校校董會另推樊正康爲校長，於萬分因難惡劣環境之下，維持校務，備極艱辛。太平洋戰争爆發，該校被逼自動停辦，樊氏避居滬寓，深居簡出，曾一再設法赴渝，終爲環境所阻，未克成行。去歲抗戰勝利，樊校長即於九月一日復校，主持校務，計劃修理楊樹浦原校址。至本年二月十五日，向校董會辭職，以讓賢能，惟校董會以樊氏服務滬大，先後達十九載，賢勞車著，特派樊氏赴美游歷，並考察敎育一年，同時美國各地　體會敎會來電，邀請樊氏赴會，現因會期逼近，業於昨晨乘飛美</p>

<h3>美國新聞敎育　美國新聞處</h3>
<p>今年九月，將在紐的哥侖比亞大學內，設立的美國新聞學院（Ameriacan　Press　Institue），將在美國新聞敎育的歷史中揭開新的一頁。它在行政上是屬於哥侖比亞大學的，但在其他方面却是獨立的，院內分新聞技衛，新聞背景兩部份，院長是紐的先鋒論壇報社論作家和哥會比亞新聞學敎授弗勞德·泰勒（Flord　Taylor）。它在籌備中的時候，已經從二十七家報紙和新聞雜誌「編者與出版家」，以及許多新聞團體得到捐助。和一般學院派的新聞學校不同，它不給學分，也沒有考試。每年收學生一百五十人，希望全國各地的新聞記者，到這裏來作研究工作，它要求各個報紙都來支持這個研究院。美國新聞學院，特別注意訓練新聞記者，它的課程是如美蘇關係，通貨膨漲，城市稅收，勞工問題這一類的。</p>
<p>在一九四一年，美國已有五百四十二所，四年制的大學內，設有新聞學系·哥侖比亞大學，密蘇里大學，以及在歐文凡斯吞的西北大學等學校，是全國公認爲新聞學界領袖的，此外還有很多州和私立大學，都有着沽躍的新聞學校和新聞系。</p>
<p>根據全美新聞學校，新聞學系聯合會（Ameriacan　Association　of　Journalistic　and　Depratments）在一九四五年十二月份的新聞季刋上發表的報吿，三十四個會員學校在一九四二年已共有一萬人得到學位，遭些人都是美國新聞界中的活躍份子。</p>
<p>十九世紀初期的投機小報和美國人民的社會願望相抵觸，這種抵觸促成了新聞記者的專『訓練。內戰中南軍的有名將領勞伯特·E·李（Robert　E　Lee）第一次在大學設新聞學課程。那時他是佛幾尼亞州勒克斯頓的華盛頓大學校長（現在呌做華盛頓·李大學），在一八六九年他就要求學校董事會設五十個獎學金給那些願終身從事出版事業或新聞事業的靑年人。</p>
<p>許多編輯人都反對新聞敎育，他們覺得新聞學的眞正敎育只有在報紙的實地經騐中才能得到，但雖有他們的反對，各學校裏却很快的普遍設立了新聞學課程，由於它的社會的宗旨和幾千靑年的雄心，新聞學的敎育被列入美國高等敎育之中。</p>
<p>一九〇三年，約瑟夫·普立　（Joseph　Pulizer），一個有嚴　的社會觀念的，有編輯經騐的人，給哥侖比亞大學二百萬元做爲建立新聞學院的經費。哥侖比亞的普立遮新聞學院現在仍是最好的一個學院。主要的課程有報社管理，報紙出版，新聞法則，新聞倫理學，新聞學史和報一草文學。這學校在一九一二年成立，在一九三五年院長卡爾·w·亞更曼（Carl　W.Ackerman）使它成爲一個正式的學校，入學資格須大學畢業，畢業時可得碩士學位。</p>
<p>自從一九〇二年以來，新聞學的專門研究已有了很好的成果。新聞爭刋曾列出一萬個碩士。博士的論文題目，其中有廣告學。傅記學。外國的新聞學。新聞學史。報紙法律，新聞採訪和寫作，發行和宣傳，無綫電新聞及讀者興趣等。下面的幾個例子可以表現出近年來的論題的種類及範圍。</p>
<p>「廣吿工業的自動控制」</p>
<p>一九四三年支加哥大學。</p>
<p>「美國戰時檢查制度的根據與實施」，一九四五年威斯康辛大學。</p>
<p>「支加哥報紙對一九三六年總統選舉的影響」，一九三八年西北大學。</p>
<p>「一九三四—三八年加利福尼亞的報紙上有關遠東新聞的分析」，一九四〇年斯坦福大學。</p>
<p>現在美國新聞敎育已發展得能適應社會需要了。它在將來一定還要繼續發展。</p>

<h3>金鈔微降</h3>
<p>烚赤昨依然平靜，以致無人向中行請領配給貨，晨開時在一六一萬光景，交易寥落，十時後在一六〇萬內外，業中遂無須登記配給，出金放利者較多，午刻在一五八萬五光景盤旋，午後更形沈寂，屈居一六配給價以下，結果較前收回落一萬，飾金十七萬一，紋銀一千七，銀元亦平，晴拆稍平，息價自一角八分至二角一分。</p>

<h3>煤價仍陷軟檔</h3>
<p>煤市因　銷清淡，銀根又緊，大戶雖掙扎有心，但限於頭寸短微細，市價始終在軟檔徘徊，據一般觀察，大戶均待看本月份廠　條，顧客寥落，門可羅雀，又北來辦煤客帮云，目前上海白煤市價尙在繼續疲軟中，因近來北方運來煤斤者，均非煤業內行，故有貨船已達上海碼頭，尙無適當之堆棧及卸貨手續，又即欲脫手，托一二家熟悉行家出售，行家爲銷路淸淡，一時難於出手，故祇能殺價，而北方產價反抬高，運輸費用又昂，長此以往，恐影響後批到貨。</p>

<p>頃聞華美晚報（五月八日）載有貴總經理爲棉布市堪停頓談話一則，純一係抹煞事實，迹近侮辱，紗布同業，羣情憤激，要求本公會等轉請貴總經理說明該項談話之根據，查此次貴公司設立經銷處，事前並未容納大部份同業之意見，且適於此時，將爭議未決之僞商統會剩餘紗布，認定爲政府物資，公開標售，致引起同業之指摘，向公會理事會責難，棉布公會正在設法疏解，欲得合理之處置，以利官商合作之前途，不意貴總經理有此談話，使本會等愛莫能助，實所痛心，究竟報載談話，是否出由貴總經理親自發表，應請明白見示，以便轉致同業。</p>
<p>紡建之表示</p>
<p>紡建公司自接收各廠，積極增產以來，紗布產量日多，而接收之紗布，亦急待推銷，同時內地交通漸見轉佳，運輸稍便，紗布去路較廣該公司爲供應各地需要，及平抑價格起見，除在國內各大市塲設立分公司及辦事處，自行運銷外，滬市方面，因該公司業務處地方甚狹，雖將紗布間日掛牌，而每日極擁擠不堪，又以該公司售布，爲躉售性質，零購頗感不便，該公司爲變通供　，及便利布商起見，因擇滬市布疋營業最大之寳大祥等三布號，設立經銷處，售價悉照該公司掛牌，由公司派員監督，並繳納鉅額保證金，惟以經銷處一切業務事務用費，如遝輸倉庫保險及職員薪津，由經銷處負担，故於銷貨金額內給予千分之二五手續費，此種辦法，純爲推銷布疋及便利布商起見，該公司業務處，仍照舊掛牌發售，事實上即爲增加一發售地點，對布商並無不利云。</p>
<p>經銷處退讓</p>
<p>負責經銷處之丁方源，聞已表示不願繼續，而中紡公司副總經理吳味經，則謂中紡委託經銷者之目的，在推廣交易，被委託者至少須具備（一）銷布能力强，（二）信用可靠，（三）地點適宜，（四）資力雄厚等四條件，至於經銷制度之擴充亦在考慮中，經銷處與公司有合同關係，雙方有遵守之義務，惟有一方不能繼續，公司亦不加以強制云。</p>
<h3>財政部規定　薪給所得稅減免　不得超過最高公務員之免稅標準</h3>
<p>上海直接稅局，頃奉財政部直接稅署令，以本市各業從業員薪給報酬所得稅計課標準，雖前經比照公務員新津計課辦法訂定計算公式，公布施行在案，而數月以來，各業從業員薪給所得，迭有增加，每月所得有超過公務員最高額薪給數倍以上者，若悉按前訂課稅額課稅所享受之免稅額，未免過高，旣失公平之旨，且亦不合累進稅制之原意，茲爲補救此項缺點起見，自四月份起，增訂補充辦法一種，即以最高級公務員薪金八百元每月所得之免稅額爲最高免稅額，各業從業員，如每月薪給數超過最高公務員之薪給者，其超過部份，無論係用津貼或生活補助費名義，均應視爲課稅所得額計算課稅，例如生活補助費基本數爲四萬元，薪給加成數爲一百三十倍，以最高級公務員底薪八百元計算，則每月收入爲十四萬四千元，此數即爲最高免稅額，如有某從業員每月薪給十五萬元，减除公務員最高薪給外，尙餘六千元，爲課稅</p>
<h3>呢絨堅滯</h3>
<p>呢絨售價，現仍堅挺，蓋來路貨運到不多，且乏正式合銷之萬家貨，而其行情爲種種所造成，開沽照市，亦無甚便宜，同時本廠貨之生產，數量有减無增，甚至由事實之證明，成本竟多超過市價之上，觀乎中紡之開派貨品，開價未平，且多係不應時與粗毛絲質等下槍貨，以致執貨者，大半不肯過份削賤，鑒能銷路方面，一因均欲等候到貨而望跌，大家延緩添需，二因靑黃不接時季關係，三受互相觀望不前，各帮各號俱抱隨吐隨補，穩扎穩打主義之故，絕無預購囤儲者在，因此造成價堅銷滯之局面。</p>
<h3>食糖趨勢續疲　上檔枝干桂元均升</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢續疲，公會　盤中砂白爲五萬八千元至五萬七千七百五十元，又跌千元，車白蜜六萬二千元，本雪白六萬二千元，號貨開出特高，刁靑五萬二千元，普通四萬八千元，次莊四萬餘元。</p>
<p>荔枝干因到存均稀，市勢復緊，昨南市號家又開出一批，價爲十九萬元，比前升一萬元，上莊雜路大式桂元八萬六千元，升五千餘元。</p>
<h3>首批羊肝漆到　銅器綠紗皆堅昂</h3>
<p>羊肝漆，印度方面有到貨，第一批五百箱，已於昨日起岸，市價尙難平落，因成本稅運諸費均昂，且實銷尙股之故，至國貨銅器製品，如銅包鎖及抽屜鎖，因原料步昂，工會均貴，客銷方面，津帮稍有進胃，市價堅挺，但與底盤成本相去尙遠，元釘因乏實銷，市價見疲，綠紗以時令關係，有步步高昂之勢，</p>
<h3>美金鑛主會商　要求自由出口</h3>
<p>〔路透社舊金山八日電〕南達柯泰，老洛拉多，華盛頓及加里福尼亞等地金礦經營者廿人，最近在此舉行非正式會談，擬製成計劃，貢獻美國財政部，准將新出鑛之金，裝船運往海外各地，俾使美國之採金礦商，得於自由之世界市價中獲取利益。美國鑛業聯合會秘書諾浦指稱：金價在埃及，土耳其，智利，巴西等國，現正上漲，每盎司在美金四十三元至一百廿元之間，但美財政部僅限價卅五元一盎司，並限制美金鑛商人，使能出售於財部。諾浦繼稱：一九四四年美出口黃金，以用於美術之製成金爲主，的値美金八千五百萬元云。</p>
<h3>美棉一萬件到滬　海浙輪由青島運到大批人造絲及菸葉</h3>
<p>華倫公司經理之鈕華爾特勝號，昨日自美抵滬，運來棉花一萬零一百六十餘件，現泊江南船廠前浮筒起卸，今日招商局執信號駛津，有棉花一千六百餘件運去，係善後救濟署報裝。</p>
<p>人造絲烟葉大批到滬，招商局海浙輪，前日自靑島來滬，運來人造絲一千零六十箱，係中央信託局之貨，又有烟葉二千三百五十件。</p>

<h3>河內去來　充滿着看在眼裏悶在心頭的事象</h3>
<p>— 本報五月二日航訊特約記者梁小中</p>
<p>南開出畫，越北去來，正是山花遍　，　聲撩人的時節。征　拂盡，細細回味着這一片印度支那半島大平原的　　風光，再加上許多看在眼裏，悶在心裏的事象，眞有無限的感慨。</p>
<p>今日的越南。蘊　着的不是愁否的呻吟，却是一把行將燎原的野火。　小民族並不是天生的奴隸，古交趾的兒女們，今天正在倔張地破　着　鎖，莊　地說一句：「他們要獨立！要自由！」</p>
<p>離邕州，過憑祥。車子奔馳在雄偉的鐘南　前。　蟠虎踞，獨峙邊　，幻想着一八八五年時候黑旗英雄斬將塞旗，直搗費罷的氣勢，仰　浮雲，默視蒼山，眞是倍增祖國的愛戀。</p>
<p>車出雄關，前面便是越南境屬，精緻的柏油路，寫出了統治者的苦心孤詣。兩旁翠綠的樹林，　子便從裏面無聲地劃過。同登的綠瓦紅墻，神仙都市，畢竟只是十個心臟在跳動。路旁的田野，早枯裂得不像樑子，野草迎人，烈日當空，衣衫襤褸的越南人低着頭在挑担子，推板軍。破破爛爛的茅屋，山谷中到處可見。只有同登的市面才顯得那末幽靜，那末法國化。可是法國人，却始終沒有見到一個。問一問街頭的僑胞，他們微微笑着道：「法國人怕游擊隊，早就跑了。一這是第一次看到了一個鬥爭的縮影。</p>
<p>諒山情况，亦大抵相同。只有沿途國軍背負着衝鋒搶站崗的英姿，才能激起平靜的心浪，運有昔日虎視眈眈，指向國境的砲台，而今都已爲我軍代爲拆去。看着那些三合土的殘骸，心裏眞有脫不出的痛快。</p>
<p>宣傳館小廳高懸四國旗</p>
<p>諒山再行，便到北江，這裏以前是一個鐵路的主站，而今却已是一片頽墻敗瓦，景像陰森，鐵道早已拆去，（我們接收的時候，並沒有從鐵道的器材上面佔過便宜，就算有，安南境內的鐵軌都比我國現有的小，據說這是法國人一道最精密的算盤，爲的是使中越的火車永遠不能聯運。）最値得注意的，是道兒有一個越南臨時政府的宜傳館。小小的一個廳子裏，高懸着中越美蘇的國旗，（越南的國旗是最近才擬定的形式，紅底，中間一顆黃色的大星，很有意思。）　上放滿了越文的書報雜誌，四面墻壁滿是發人深思的漫晝，刻薄而又煽動，給他們的「統治者」看了。一定要氣破肚皮。</p>
<p>到了河內，東邊跑跑，西面聽聽，尷尬的故事聽了一大堆。自然，許多令人興奮的事情並不是沒有，不過興奮裏總帶有一點麻痺的成份就是了。對越南使我們感到興趣的，不是越南女郞那一束臨風欲斷的織腰，也不是那一排墨樣的牙齒，却是我們自己的大事小事，越南人打的大仗小仗，僑胞們的眼淚！</p>
<p>穿草鞋入越載得滿囊歸</p>
<p>「八一五」後，九月國軍入越受降。當時的盛况，眞是難以訴說。河內的僑胞，高高的扎起彩牌，拚命的拿錢出來，第一步踏入河內的國軍，不論營排連長，以至最低級的勤務兵，一律請他們住到最精緻的大旅館裏。富商們自動的獻出房屋做營房。女學生們替傷兵洗脚。夜夜盛宴，日日狂歡，沒有一個僑胞不是樂到心花都開了。皆大歡喜之中，五子登科，三洋開泰的越南版，也就急急如律令敕了開來。看得新鮮東西太多的僑胞，也更上一層樓，再看更多的莫明其妙。首先是汽車搶，房子搶，說出來有點不好意思，連抽水馬桶也塞到汽車上。自然，來來去去又要說是「一小部分」的不肖份子的傑作，就只有這些不肖份子，穿着草鞋入去。出來的時候，袋裏一堆鈔票，左邊一個女人，右邊一架安南單車，手上一個手錶，一串戒指，這只是不肖的低級幹部，高一點的也就心照不宣了。</p>
<p>國車退一步關金跌一丈</p>
<p>使到僑胞傾家蕩產的，不是小取小予的問題，却是抓去了他們生命的幣値的間題。國軍初到的時候，華僑如是聽說，法票不用，一律關金交易。再加上他們一顯熱透了的心，以爲從此自然是要萬事信仰我們自己，於是拚命的把法票拋出，買關金，要我們目己的紙幣。多熱啊一一百元關金要換百五元的法紙，換二百元也願意。商店標明是關金本位，書店標明用關金計值。關金熱，法紙打到十八層地獄，完全是出自一片赤誠的天眞的心，沒有半點經濟的理論。可惜的是：曾幾何時，國軍退一步，關金跌一丈，跌到今天，已經是一百元關金換不到法票三十元，拋出法票的商人，皆大破產，自殺的，逃亡的，入獄的，處處可聞。一塲甜夢，烟消雲散，關金的黃金時代過去，僑胞的興奮也消失了。一塲大破產，苦了的還是自己人。豈但如此，僑胞還要有一塲更大的苦難。</p>
<p>中法簽恊定苦頭吃不盡</p>
<p>首先，記者要寫一點「前奏」之類，才好明白事實的眞相。國軍的受降地區，只是到北緯十六度的地方。僑胞聚居的西貢堤岸，不在受降區內，河內海防的僑胞還能够認輿歡笑一塲。不管笑後是否跟着便是眼淚，而西堤一帶（廣泛一點說，可以說是中南圻一帶）的僑胞，却是終日以眼淚洗面。中法協定簽訂了，西堤的「華人稅紙」却跟着加了一半價錢，以前只要蓋五個指模，現在要蓋足十個。姦淫燒殺比日本入佔據的時候，「友好」不了多少，說是報復可以，說是「活該」也沒辦法。誰呌自己不長進，人家要打你一拳，便打你一拳，現在，這一拳打到河內來了。</p>
<p>薑頭辣椒湯緊隨暴風來</p>
<p>「海防事件」一塲暴風雨過後，（這一塲「登陸」，並不簡單，而且可以說是極野蠻，我們給打壞了倉庫，也老實不客氣地做沉了他們一艘砲艦，誰呌他們要武力解決這不成問題的問題？留在內地的法軍還破壞了我們軍運返國的公路，這一板斧的用意，大家都明白。）法軍畢竟亳不困難地在三月中旬開入河內，法國的僑民歡迎他們，與我們的僑胞歡迎國軍一式一樣。歡迎過後，越南人和我們的僑胞，也就躬逢其盛，霑益了不少薑頭辣椒湯，高唱「不自田，母寗死」的英雄們眞自由到不可開交。强姦，搶刦，大吃大暍，不付一文而去，實在威風八面。好在河內國軍，尙未撤盡，畢竟還是自家人好一點，不然，河內的僑胞眞不知道「伊於胡底」了。敦睦邦交，是一回事，認淸事實，又是一回事。不能够互尊互愛，何必一定要用香水去掩飾血腥？</p>
<p>越南國民黨阮海臣領導</p>
<p>一方面，法方願我們的國軍早退早好，另一方面，又「因治安未能穩定」，要求國軍緩撤，矛盾的矛盾裏面，早就吿訴我們這是怎麼的一會事。我們自然有分寸，不會做傻子。現在，讓我們看一看越南民族爭取自由的高潮吧！</p>
<p>越南的三大政黨，是：越南獨立同盟，國民黨，革命同盟。就中以國民黨的歷史最爲悠久，領導人是阮海臣，七十多歲的老頭子，幹了五十多年的革命，對中國了解最深。可惜的是幹部缺乏，武力單薄，（有一軍人駐硭街，全軍七百人。）所以不能够有更偉大的成就，月前雖曾參加胡志明所控制下的「聯合政府」，結果因不滿胡的施爲而退出，而且曾經動過一次刀槍，現已間道自越入桂。</p>
<p>「先殺中國人再對法抗戰」</p>
<p>越南獨立同盟的首腦是胡志明，是淸一色的共產黨。四十多歲，瘦個子，曾在蘇聯「　　」。　部多數從延安來，是中共的又一支脈，組織了一個「聯合政府」在河內，堡大皇帝給他迫退了位，也是滿口「民主」，但確有相當武力，所以折衷於法越間，尙可說得一點話，但是所作所爲，並不見得就受越人歡迎。一方面口口聲聲：「華越一家」，一方面又高喊；「先殺盡華人，再與法鬼抗戰」，是他們的雙　戲。垂人倒霉的果然不少，與法思抗戰倒未見得。眞正爭獨立的只有聯合政府還未內鬨，越人仇法的心理最高潮的時候，才可以看到一些偉大的行動。最初一次是三月上旬，因爲法方沒有履行法越協定，拚命在南圻增兵，激動了越人的積憤，曾在河內舉行空前的大示威運動。示威還不到五天，法軍千人竟圖自海防開河內〔鎭壓〕，結果越人大憤，紛紛自動準備應戰，劍拔弩張，一觸即發，幸得國軍出動調處，同時武力勸解法軍返防，方才了事。</p>
<p>傳臨時政府將實施改組</p>
<p>一波未平，一波又起，三月下旬，這些以殖民地統治者自居的英雄，突然派兵佔領，河內的財政部和軍械局。於是全市罷市，罷工，罷課，要法軍立即撤出。夜間槍聲四起，法僑的供應和食水完全斷絕，不得已才撤出財政部。至於南圻一帶越人背了炸彈，泅水到法艦旁邊炸沉戰艦，全身浸滿汽油去爆炸火藥庫的事，亦時有所聞。這些報導，談不到挑撥感情。眞正的感情，在越南人民的心裏，讓我們睜着眼睛看就是了。老實說：中法對於越南的協定簽訂後，僑咆又開始遭受了更大的苦　：法國人　　，越南人仇視。最近，越南臨時政府又有改組的消息，許多弄不淸的關係，只有旁觀的人才會明白。</p>
<p>準備一年內把文盲肅清</p>
<p>越南人民的向上心，絕對不可輕視，單就文化一項來說，河內的越文報州早雜誌，眞够得上一個多字。有越南〔國民黨〕救國〔獨立同盟〕，同盟〔革命同盟〕等報紙十餘家，前鋒，建設，婦女呼聲等雜誌十種。不論小販，車夫，店員，小學生，家庭婦女，到處都可以看見他們在熱心地捧着報章雜誌看。每一條街都有書店，許多敎師親自背着　範去搜集廠紙，拿回來印講議，印宣傳畫。聽說還有許多人從家裏自巴拿米來辦學校，他們準備一年內要肅淸文盲。</p>
<p>反觀我們的華僑敎育，說起來實在有點傷腦筋。負責敎育的，十九是各帮〔如廣肇帮，潮州帮〕的僑領，商人的頭腦，拿手的會省錢，那裏辦得出出色的學校？中學校整天背古文，小學校整天讀三字經，法文非讀不可，充滿了帝國主義和半封建殖民地的結晶。說起來怨不了誰，只有怨海外敎育工作實在做得太可憐！</p>
<p>書店有靑年書店（靑年團辦），僑聯和東成，都是無甚足觀，賣一點敎科書，小說，文具。最近籌備出版的，有南洋岡書出版公司。日報方面有靑年團辦的靑年日報，四開一張，發行人高修武。法軍未開河內前，專揭發西堤華僑遭受的慘象，所以頗遭法方之忌，行將成立的有「太平洋日報」，背景不明。期刋有海外部所辦的中　問題，有中鐺文臘照。至今仍能暢銷不較的，是蔣主席的「中國之命　」。因爲這裏精神食糧貧乏，所以由昆明航　及由南寗快遞的報紙，在這裏頗受歡迎，相當暢銷。</p>
<p>日俘殺法軍自戕以了事</p>
<p>日本的戰俘，到了今天，已有大部遣送。一部用卡車取道南寗到廣州，一部則逕在海防登輪。這些自傲的天孫武士，早就已無氣燄可言。在路上兌了國軍，必定鞠躬如也地敬禮。國軍也　　氣地點一點頭，算是回禮。有時候簡直就不理會。可是戰俘倒也有點看人行事，碰到法軍，不理也不踩，昂然過去。有一次，一個日俘在街上給三個法國軍官欄住問他甚麽不敬禮？日俘乾脆地答道：「我們是向中國投降，不是向你們投降。」兩個法國軍官拉出槍來，要收拾他，却給這日俘一脚踢跌在地，把兩枝槍向墻邊一扔，揚長而去。還有一次，也是同樣的事情，結果有兩個法兵給一個日俘打死，那日俘也自殺了事。說起來頗耐人尋味。可是俘虜們永遠都是那末地服從國軍，開到南寗的俘虜，一車只有一個國軍押車，從來沒有鬧過亂子。而且都是穿得又破又爛，一樣吃糙米飯過日。在河內，日僑和日本婦女倒很少見。</p>
<p>四日的逗留，一切都像走馬看花，除了聽而外，看的實在不多，要我說出越北的實况，實在有點難於形容。它有點像剛點燃的爆竹，又像浸了水的火藥，表面平靜一時，緊張一時，能够相信的是：遲早我們總會有一次不平凡的戲劇可看。（五月二日於南寗）</p>
<h3>蘇北同胞血淚語　逃出了虎口陷入飢餓綫</h3>
<p>— 本報南京六日通訊駐京記者張明</p>
<p>八年艱苦支撑爲的是重見天日，留着黃帝子孫的血統，想再呼吸到中華民族的自由空氣，但是，今天，逍個勝利以後的日子，我們享交到的，是沒有陽光的漫漫長夜，無盡頭的黑暗。八年來，流屣顚簸，是個難民，勝利到來，翹首歸里，做個承平時代的老百姓，沒有奢望，「安居樂業」是唯一的希望，也是唯一應得的權利，然而，我們，幾百萬蘇北同胞，終竟把這個希望成了不可兌現的理想，應享的權利，成了不該享受的罪惡。我們依然是難民，從鎭揚一帶始，這一幅流民圖，是血和淚組成的。話從那裏說起呢？</p>
<p>河是死水路是陷阱</p>
<p>我們抗戰，打勝了日寇，但是我們立刻又陷落在沒有了人性的非人類的共軍的宰割之下。我們沒有住的自由，因爲共軍到處，所有的屋字都被拆毁了，有時拆得嫌太麻煩了，就來個火化，全部燒燬，使我們沒有了「住」的餘地。再說，我們也沒有了「行」的自由以及「行」的權利，寬敞的大道來一個破壞，成幾里長的挖成了河，原來是河的地方，又讓他似是而非的塡了起來。你要走嗎？河是死水，路是陷阱。何况你想走，也還須得到准許，吾則你就是逃，逃的人被抓到是沒有命的。在衣食方面說當然更不自由，你想穿得暖和，如意合式，你就將成爲「鬥爭」的對象，同時你就非得成爲去「鬥」人的人不可，吾則你總歸是「頑固」，再就是「國特」。安份守已的老百姓是不可能存在的，他們不歡迎你，但是他們叉需要一部份人來作爲點綴，這一部份人是用着專門接受命令的，也就是唯命是從，他要你怎樣，你就怎樣。如有違抗，你仍歸於「頑固」份子。</p>
<p>上游挖港下游毀壩</p>
<p>最近在蘇北一帶，他們開始着兩項可怕的行爲：一是將成熟而尙未到收割的時候，就一掃而光的割掉，同時，現在是播權的時期，在這無室可居的時候正是無家可歸，還從何播種？於是春收無望，秋種不播，未來的災荒是多麽可怕？他們更想到一個國積的辦法，把所有存糧，全部搜索收集起來，裝進屋子裏，再把牆壁全封起來，據說是備作軍糧。也就是「軍」字第一，所謂「民兵是老爺」。眞正的老百姓只有餓死。其次是淮水，上游把港挖掉，下游將壩毁去，海水引進，河水汜濫，於是人民沒有「住」，沒有「吃」。這種滅絕人類的行爲，才是新四軍的主旨。</p>
<p>長程流徙萬里投荒</p>
<p>我們有一顆正直的心，有一付鎭靜的頭腦，爲什麽我們該受道無瑪的壓迫？爲什麽我們不能亭受人的權利。我們流徙千里投荒萬里求生无能，死刦不甘心，在鎭江，在南京，接受着　　的熱忱招待，救濟我們，但是我們希望是：「在軍事政治方國，快給他們一個澄淸，我們要圓老家去，我們要拿協已的力量養活自己，要回去看我們的祖宗，　地下的先露！」</p>
<p>記者面對着這位流落的難胞，一個字，一滴淚的說着，我欲以一滴血寫一個字，敬吿我們所謂民主解放的新四軍，你們「民主」基層老百姓，已經投到了另一個民主的須　裏了。你們還有什麽呌民主？違背了絕對大多數人民的意志來談民主，這難道是現實嗎？你們口口聲聲說放在第一綫的民生題，但是何黨把民生解決了呢？相反的，蘇地人民刦已沉在水深火熱之中，而今流亡，流亡，什麽時候才回到老家從淮安，從揚州，從泰興，從如皋，從各個地區流亡出來的人，停留在南京的已經有着一個可觀的製目，他們元以爲生，總算在京同鄉已經在設法籌款救濟，也許可能在短期內信他們一個安定的住所，但是　結所在，各方正期待着一個完整的具體的解決辦法。</p>
<h3>金陵煙雲</h3>
<p>— 南京三日通訊　芝楠寄</p>
<p>文化園地，在首都，嚴格一點說，似有荒蕪之感。日報有中央日報，和平日報，大剛報，中國日報等幾家，都是對開張的大報。小型的有救國日報，朝報，新民晚報，南京晚報，南京人報等幾家。紙張雖好，但內容不見精彩，趕不上重慶或上海的報紙。在京出版的雜誌，好像祗有中央周刋一種，其他還沒有看到。</p>
<p>藝苑風光　從荒凉到熱鬧</p>
<p>話劇也很落後，祇有飛龍閣的「中旅」劇團，空氣沉悶。電影院有大華，新都，首都，國民，世界，文化劇院等幾家，大都是好萊塢片子的放映者，並且是在其他地方放映過後纔送到這裏，生意也很淸淡，沒有重慶那樣排隊買票的現象。不過自從還都人員繼續增加以後，影院也　呈熱鬧的氣象了。</p>
<p>金陵繁華　由秦淮移舞塲</p>
<p>提起金陵，呌人油然想起六朝烟水。人們在車塵甫卸之後，都喜作三日遊，徜徉於山水之間。紫金山上的白色陵寢，依然如舊，謁陸的人絡繹於途。城南夫子廟，而今是比常年冷落了。秦淮河已無復過去旖旎風光，河水渾綠，隨風吹來臭味。破舊的魚舫泊在橋邊，當年紅粉佳人，已不知飄流何處？祇有雙雙燕子掠水而過，呢喃不休，恍如感時懷舊。時代是在變換，往日秦淮河上笙歌沸大，管絃不絕，而今整華已從水上轉向燈紅　綠的舞瑪。當年在秦淮渡生涯的女郞，大都改叫換面，走下舞池，婆娑起舞於燈影裏。</p>
<p>櫻桃熟了　瑪瑙紅翡翠綠</p>
<p>事實上，春天不在舞池，却在郊野。前些日子，靈谷寺的牡丹盛開，好景不凡，現在可不知凋謝了沒有？玄武湖上，柳絮飛舞，楡錢吹落，櫻桃正熟，紅如瑪瑙，綠比翡翠，設若乘游艇穿過藻行，划到湖心，遠望靑山塔影，手剝櫻桃，豈非如入夢境！</p>
<p>美國製造新流缐型火車</p>
<p>這是大北鐵路新的流線型「帝國建設者」火車，現正在大批趕造中，由此可見新的火車建設事業之一斑。下半年中，可望造成十二節的火車共五組，將按日開駛於支加哥與太平洋西北岸之閱。該車外部顏色爲橘紅與綠色二種。火車頭有四千匹馬力。</p>

<p>國民黨是曾領導全國人民推倒滿清及軍閥和抗戰種種革命統一救亡的工作底政黨，這幾椿事，在理論上，事實上，誰能否認這些不是國民黨的功績！從現在看，從歷史看，國民黨的主義，國民黨的政策，終不失爲領導全國復興的指導原則。由此也河見國民黨的執政當局，仍然忠實地奉行其黨綱，並沒有自甘墮落，並沒有企圖保持私人的勢力。、</p>
<p>他們的政策，容或有不滿人意的地方；他們的黨員，不免也有腐敗份子；但那不是整個國民黨的事。而且在全國人民的督促下，這都是可以糾正的。或者有人說「在現行政府之下，人民的權利，根本就不能發揮，那裏還有督促政府的力量」。我固不敢說現在確已民主，也不能料及憲政實施後的民主程度如何，但有一點確可樂觀，在政府所管轄的區域中，有反對黨的機關和報紙，他們都可肆無忌憚地攻擊政府，攻擊當局，然而在素稱民主的中共區域中誰看見公開反對共黨的報紙或書籍呢？</p>
<p>總之，國民黨有着他不可磨滅的功績，是不容我們輕易忘記的</p>
<p>現在再來談談共產黨吧！</p>
<p>我在不久以前，思想也曾左領過，當時認爲共產黨是有辦法的政黨，他們在國民黨的壓迫之下，屈處西北，刻苦奮門了二十餘年，仍然保持很大的勢力，握有不在少數的黨員，同時他們的每一黨員，都是奮發有爲的中堅份子，似乎較諸國民黨的腐敗情形，有生氣得多。</p>
<p>我也曾希望過，中國需要一個强大的反對黨，並不是怕如民主論者所憂慮的「一黨專政」之類的話，却因爲是使在朝在野的政黨，都存着一番警戒競爭之心，俾得日益求精，努力前進。</p>
<p>於是我乃希望共產黨是我理想中的政黨。</p>
<p>不幸從日本投降以後，於開始對中共失望。從朱德的那份電報起，使我逐漸認識了中共的面目。原來是打着「人民」「民主」的幌子，却包藏禍心，岡謀不軌。</p>
<p>中共最大的惡點是：強佔東北和阻礙交通，揭穿他們的用意，還不是割據地盤，造成旣成事實，藉此要挾政府，俾能討價還價而已。這種只圖目的不擇手段的政策，眞令人裴憤欲絕！</p>
<p>現在中共藉口的理由，不外是政府不願實行政協決議一類的話，但憑這就可以發動謀叛的戰事了麽！</p>
<p>這裏對政府是否不願實行政協決議，姑置不論，我們再進一步檢討，國民黨是創造中華民國的領導者，當然有權利在政府中佔絕對的傷勢，然而共產黨憑什麽理由却要在未來的政府中佔有優越的位置？那是人民所公選的呢？還是向政府要挾得來的呢？假使屬於後一種的話，那麼共黨須得量力才是。換一句話，從民主講來，是毫無理由的；一個政黨，需要表現他的力量在人民的面前，由人民心悅誠服交給他的政權，才是名正言順。如果捨本求末，因此而發動攻勢，那適足玩火自焚而已。</p>
<p>共黨不是常說他在抗戰中建有莫大的功跡嗎！我泯目一想，在許多有名的戰事中如淞滬會戰，徐州會戰以及長沙會戰……等都是中央軍的記錄，但在共軍的軍事陣綫內，似乎像未有這些出色的戰事吧！而黃橋事件之類，則倒是共軍的拿手好戲。所謂「游而不擊」到也罷了；像這樣專門「游擊」中央，寗有此理！（這樣的事實太多，實在不勝枚舉）請問共黨有什麽資格米主宰國家大政！</p>
<p>國家的前途，太不堪設想，我憐惜憤恨那些無聊的靑年們，他們將自己的熱情消耗得太無意義了，不該去助長共黨的氣燄，不該在國家需要恢復元氣的時候，來幹一種危險性的擾亂工作。翹堯，卅五，四，廿八。</p>

<p>自由談　婦女与家庭特輯</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>解去婦女的桎梏</h3>
<p>— 無我</p>
<p>雖然，現代的婦女們，已經感到了受壓迫的痛苦，而喊出了解放的口號，但是，這些在大家看來，還都嫌太空虛：唱高調，何濟於事，要的實地去幹才行。</p>
<p>受壓迫，就好傑套着桎梏；而要解放，所走的途徑，那只有除去桎梏！</p>
<p>這些桎梏是什麼呢？可說的，不外乎二種：一，生育，撫養孩子的累；二，燒飯，料理家務的累。所以，忙瞭了這二點，就可以認淸目標，去覓解放之道了。什麼是解放之道呢？</p>
<p>一，舉辦國營托兒所　這一點，已經有好多人說過了，不過，我還有一些要補充：我國現在存在的托兒所，成績糟透，所以雖然有這項名目，却沒有什麽人將自己的孩子送進去養育，所以，假如能够有普遍化的國營托兒所開辦，設備周全，方針實施優良的話，那末，無疑的，父母們都會將自己的兒女很安心地送進去，讓他們受到偉大的，羣的敎育和生活，使成爲健全的人才，這不但與下一代的主人有利，而且，做母親的，也可以因此卸下這一部分責任，而去做更重要，更有益於人類的工作。</p>
<p>二，設立大衆化食堂　第一個難關旣已打破，那就看第二個難關了。設立了普遍的大衆化食堂，那末，男女老少，旣可以很舒適地去亨受，就根本用不到歸女重回廚房了。至於料理家務，本來不當由婦女單獨去做，而是應該由男女共同負祖的。</p>
<p>於是，我們得到了婦女的解放之道，假如一旦完善辦到，那末，立刻，婦女們便可卸下了道束縛了數千年切桎梏了。解放了自己，把自己貢獻給社會國家，爲社會國家服務，和男子一樣地去做各項應該做的事！</p>
<p>希望婦女界不要再唱高調了，努力地認淸了目標去做，由解放之道而解放！</p>
<p>家敎</p>
<h3>管敎兒女我見</h3>
<p>— 羅淑如</p>
<p>人人都希望自己的兒女好，但是有許多人不讓自己的兒女讀書，就想坐享其利，從命運八字裘，僥倖得到幾個特色的兒女。還有許多人，只知道送兒女入學校，供給他學費書籍，文具，便算是盡了爲父母的責任。如果兒女不好，那是怨孩子不爭氣，或者咒詛學校師長太鬆懈。</p>
<p>學校固然是培養人才的地方但是上課時問一天不過五六小時，還是在家的時間多。况且師長以數人管敎數千百人，還是不如家長，以一人管敎數人的效率來得快。所以說，家庭敎育與學校敎育是應當相輔並重的。</p>
<p>我對管敎兒女主張以身作則，使兒女日聞日見，有所適從，所以把自己眞是約束得筆桿正直，一時一事甚至一句話，不敢疏忽，唯恐在兒女面前失了信仰。</p>
<p>孩子們如有要求，可以答應的，答應後必實行。不可以答應的，當時便把不能答應的理由說明，決不含糊以應，疏忽不行。至於設騙局應付的勾當，更不敢做。我決不因怒行責，因喜恕過，平時與人共事，必事事講求倌實，使孩子們自然而然地納入信實的正軌。</p>
<p>他們那一次成績好，一定有獎勵，以引起他們知進取好向上的心理。那一事做錯，必嚴厲訓貢，使他們知廉恥而勇於悔改。</p>
<p>隨時隨事，就每個孩子的程度，補充給常識。不只敎單讀死課本，以充實其智識。對於他們的嬉戲，時刻注意，以合乎禮，不害衛生的爲原則。</p>
<p>如過學校有掛倡捐助公益的事情，那我就雖然節省吃用，亦要給錢敎他們去捐。爲的是要養成他們樂於爲善的天性，和遇事負責的習慣。</p>
<p>有一次，次兒三兒的學校要修理，勸募經費。我的處境固然很困難，但我認爲這是我兒子的責無旁貨，應花的錢，於是盡力地敎他們去捐。「一人捐便是，何以還要兩人去捐？我家又沒錢」。大兒不高興沉吟地說着。「愛護國家是每個人民的責任，愛護學校是每個學生的責任，人人應有負責的勇氣，不可推諉。他們旣然是兩個人讀書，便當然要兩個人去捐，使他們明白各人願當負起各人的責任來』。我慢慢地答覆訓誨着。我兒聽了，很以爲然。於是他們各記在各人的日記本上。可見小孩子意志薄弱，好像時刻在是非曲直的岔口，猶豫徘徊。如果能隨時指給他們應走的路，那便不用打駡，自然會走入正途。</p>
<p>我次不敢說我管敎的孩子好，不過目下看來，大的己能端正自立，小的亦很聽話，愛讀書。常聽見有人對我說：『你的孩子　樣能管得這樣好，我的孩子打死，總不聽話。天生好的不用管，壞的活累煞！』所以今天我想起寫出這一段話來，謂做母親的，明白孩子生下來並沒有什麽好的壞的。譬如一棵小樹，在你去培養灌溉，削砍荒蕪枝節，護理正長樹幹，以期達到長成一根有用的棟梁。不要專用打的方法去管敎，還是「以身作則』『循循善誘」爲日。</p>
<p>國家興亡，匹夫有責。際茲男女平等時代，我們女子對國家興亡，亦要負起一半責任來。管敎兒女，爲國所用，豈非我們女子愛國應負的任？</p>
<h3>媳婦歌</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>南瓜籐，兩頭環，</p>
<p>我做媳婦眞正難。</p>
<p>公一望，婆一張，</p>
<p>生怕我倫米貼親娘。</p>
<p>老公公，老婆婆，</p>
<p>寬心吧！</p>
<p>娘家不是窮人家。</p>
<p>吃的隔年米，</p>
<p>住的高瓦房，</p>
<p>穿的綾羅緞，</p>
<p>睡的象牙床，</p>
<p>用不着偸米貼親娘。</p>
<p>這首歌描繪媳婦與公婆間的猜疑，十分生動。婆媳問的不睦，是中岡社會上一個普通的現象。</p>
<p>怎樣調和婆媳間的情感？這不是三言兩語所能說完的。總而言之，爲公婆者，要處處替媳婦設想；而做媳婦者，也該時時原諒公婆。雙方互相體諒，什麽意見，糾紛，自會消滅於無形了。</p>
<p>醫藥</p>
<h3>百日咳</h3>
<p>— 華美</p>
<p>百日咳，西名Ｗhooping　Cough。我國古稱鷺　咳，民間俗呼頓咳。都以咳嗽的性狀得名，係一種有接傳染病。凡患者的痰唾暗嚏，都爲傅佈的媒介。此病最多發生於春季。患者以十歲以下之小兒居多。三歲以內者更多。如一週歲以內的小兒罹之，恒爲致命之患。逾十歲者間亦有感染，但不多見。</p>
<p>百日咳的病菌爲Bordet-Gengou　Bacillus。傳染人體之途徑爲上呼吸道。所以患痧子及傷風後，最易患百日咳。雖傳染不若痧子及傷風那般快，但任何小兒和病者接觸時，俱有感罹的危險。</p>
<p>染上百日咳病菌後，經過四日到十五日的潛伏期，必發生類似氣管炎狀的咳嗽。程度漸次增加，變爲流行性感冒狀的咳嗽。夜問比白晝厲害。此時病兒有時有微熱。這樣經過一星期後，遂逐漸成爲陣發性的咳嗆，咳嗽之音調係目氣管內發出。所以有嘶喊的尾音，同時病兒食慾减退（亦有食慾照常者），夜間睡眠不良，面容浮壅，眼皮水腫。下眼臉紫紅。</p>
<p>咳嗆的陣發係百日咳的持徵，發作的次數，如係安眠時發作，夜間多於白天，如係遊玩之際發作，則爲突然而咳，咳陣發作之前常有一種持異預兆，如不安的樣子，或者忽然趨就母親懷中，其他如呼吸急促，飲食過急，啼哭，忿怒，等亦均足惹起陣咳，如於哺乳後或進食後劇咳，則每易致嘔吐。</p>
<p>百日咳的病程頗長，如患者不及早施行適當的治療（百日咳血淸治法）每可延長至二三月不等。所以有百日之稱。但以一小兒之體格，經綿至此，身體上所遭受的磨折早已不堪承受，所以不到一月，小兒早已身體消瘦，營養不足，皮色蒼白，臉容浮腫，兩眼微突，眼眶因劇咳時小血管爆裂，略呈靑紫顏色，病狀不可謂不兇險，病期中且隨時可以併發支氣管炎肺炎，腦膜炎等等危險併發症。</p>
<p>百日咳粗視之，似乎並非一絕對危險之病症，但若細行統計各種小兒死亡的原因，即可發覺百日咳所佔的數目實相當驚人，且死亡者以二歲以內的小兒患者爲最多，（大抵百日咳死亡數中二歲以下之小孩竟佔百分之八十强。）小兒死亡病類中，百日咳的佔全數百分之十二。</p>
<p>百日咳的持徵，爲持異的啼聲及咳嗽的陣發，足爲診斷之證，這在呼吸器官疾患中係一種持殊僅有的現象，但道啼狀的痙咳，在最初一星期中，必較爲晦匿。有時因小兒年齡過於幼稚，雖然陣暖也不能作啼叫的聲音，因此診斷困難時，可用細菌學檢騐方法斷定。法係將小兒的唾液或涕液送交任何醫學檢騐所檢騐，他們就能提出可靠的證明。此外，患者面容苦有特殊變化，如眼臉徽腫，眼眶深暗，面部虛浮，亦可爲百日咳的佐證。</p>
<p>百日咳有一特效療法，即自今盛行的菌苗療法，（百日孩血淸療法）這方法收效最速，而無不良的副作用，祇須意外併發症尙未形成，不論患者的病狀已如何嚴重，均能克奏膚功。但治療當然愈早愈妙。如在陣咳尙未形成之前即加治療，祗須一星期即能治愈，吾則須經過六次至十二次的注射，的需十二日至一個月方能治愈。</p>

<h3>The Outskirts of Shenyang Are Increasingly Consolidated; National Army Strengthens the Right Wing to Ensure Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 8th Dispatch] The situation in the Northeast is unusually gloomy. The battle in the vicinity of Siping Street continues, but officials refuse to comment on the battle situation there. The Communist side still insists that Siping Street is in the hands of the Communist army, and claims that there is no conflict north of Siping Street. South of Shenyang, the National Army is only at the Dashiqiao Station on the South Manchuria Railway. However, in the southwest of Shenyang, since the National Army recaptured Benxi, the threat to Fushun has been lifted, and the outskirts of Shenyang are more consolidated. It is generally speculated that the National Army will continue its advance along the Anfeng Railway, aiming at the Communist army's base in Andong, Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] According to reports: 5,000 shock troops of the New First Army have arrived at Gongzhuling and are currently fighting the elite Communist forces under Lin Biao.

The Communist Party claims that seven divisions of the National Army, including the three divisions of the New First Army, are fighting between Siping Street and Gongzhuling, commanded by General Zheng Dongguo. The New First Army's attack on Gongzhuling marks the beginning of the Battle of Changchun. The National Army has received reinforcements from the Benxi Lake area, where 100,000 Communist troops were recently defeated by the National Army.

<p>[United Press Changchun, 3rd Dispatch] (Delayed) Today, recruitment posters are posted everywhere in Changchun, which shows that Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Communist Army, is still trying to expand the size of his army.</p>
<p>[United Press Changchun, 1st Dispatch] (Delayed) The Communist Party has more than 300,000 troops in the Northeast.

The Northeast Bureau, the highest administrative organ of the Communist Party in the Northeast, completed its move into Changchun on the afternoon of the 1st. It is expected that Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Communist Army, will also move his headquarters into the city within a few days. In addition, the commanders of the Communist army in the eastern, western, southern, and northern districts of the Northeast will also establish liaison offices here.</p>
<p>[United Press Changchun, 2nd Dispatch] (Delayed) General Peng Ren (transliteration), Secretary-General of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party, issued a warning today, stating: if American naval vessels continue to transport National Army troops to the Northeast, then General Marshall's peace efforts in China, including the efforts of the Executive Headquarters, will fail.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang, considering that General Dai Li, Director of the Military Intelligence Bureau, during the Anti-Japanese War, led his troops in continuous hard battles against the enemy and puppets, and assisted the Allied forces working behind enemy lines in completing arduous tasks, making great contributions. Unfortunately, he died in a plane crash, which is deeply regrettable. He personally went to General Dai's spirit tablet on Zhongshan East Road at 11:00 AM yesterday, paying tribute and silently mourning for one minute. After the ceremony, he inquired about the living conditions of General Dai's surviving family members. It is reported that the families of the Military Intelligence Bureau staff who died in the same accident as Dai have been compensated by the National Government.</p>

He passed through here today and is scheduled to continue flying to Tokyo tonight. Pauley said that he will also consider the general economy of East Asia and investigate the ability of Korea and the nine eastern provinces to produce raw materials to supply factories, which will eventually be transferred from Japan to China and the Philippines as reparations. Factories that are not required for Japan's basic peacetime economy or that have the potential to promote war must be dismantled. The estimated "current" value of this equipment is 300 million US dollars.</p>
<p>[US News Agency San Francisco, 8th Dispatch] Pauley is about to come to the Far East as President Truman's personal representative and lead ambassadors to study the resources and industries of Northeast China and Korea. This research work is related to the reparations issue. President Truman announced at a press conference on May 2nd: "Pauley will study and investigate the resources and industries of the nine eastern provinces of China and Korea. This work will help the nine eastern provinces of China and Korea to use their resources and Japanese reparations to develop their economies and industries. Pauley will provide reports based on the actual situation. His research and investigation work will be based on the American point of view, and the American point of view will be based on a plan to rebuild the Far East and improve the lives of millions of people in the Far East." At the same time, the President also said that Deputy Secretary of State Acheson said that Pauley's trip will have a more important task. Another task is to collect various research materials and provide various suggestions. This suggestion will greatly help the US government and the Allied countries to formulate their Far East plans, which will promote peace and security in the Far East and the entire world.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 7th Dispatch] Hoover, Chairman of the US Emergency Relief Committee, told the Tokyo press that if the Soviet Union supplies part of the grain it obtained in the Northeast to China and Korea, it will greatly help improve the world food shortage. At the same time, the Washington Star commented on the mission of Pauley, the US representative to the Allied Reparations Committee, saying: It is extremely important to make full use of the resources of the Northeast. Pauley's mission will have a significant impact on the reconstruction of Korea and China. Without full utilization of the resources of the Northeast, the Korean economy cannot be improved, and China cannot expect material progress. The situation in the Northeast will generally affect the interests of Asia. Under this background, the importance of Pauley's efforts is by no means insignificant. Judging from President Truman's announcement of his mission, Pauley's trip will explore the following two points: (1) The Soviet Union's attitude towards the "booty" obtained from the Northeast, (2) The Soviet Union's intention to improve the Korean economy.</p>
<h3>4 Million National Currency Rewarded to Chongqing Police</h3>

<h3>National Assembly Representatives Decide to Form Inspection Group, Go to Various Places to Inspect and Comfort, Unanimously Support Chairman Chiang's Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] The preparatory meeting for the National Assembly held its eighth meeting at 10:00 AM on the 8th, with 164 people present. Zhu Huixiao and seven others served as chairmen. Three resolutions were passed: (1) To show unanimous support for Chairman Chiang's instructions yesterday, and to understand the President's loyalty to the country, sincerity in loving the people, and the hardships he has endured. (2) The National Assembly Preparatory Committee should continue to exist and strive for soundness before the official opening of the National Assembly. (3) To organize a consolation group to inspect and comfort various places, and to listen to the public's views on national affairs. At the beginning of the registration of National Assembly representatives, the representatives' fellowship association hosted reporters. Recognizing that the representatives who were enthusiastic about national affairs after the postponement of the conference must feel depressed, the reporter of this newspaper was invited to speak, suggesting that the representatives in Beijing use their time to organize an inspection group to go deep into the people to investigate the actual situation of the people victimized in various places due to blocked transportation, for reference. Representatives from various provinces, such as Cao Jingyuan, Li Hongru, and He Bingru, sincerely accepted the suggestion, and now it will be put into action, which shows that the National Assembly representatives respect public opinion. It is learned that the National Assembly Preparatory Committee has prepared airplanes, ships, and trains for the representatives who are preparing to return to their hometowns to meet the needs of the representatives traveling or returning home at any time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Representatives of Sichuan, Xikang, Hubei, Anhui, and Xinjiang provinces, Leng Pudong, Kuang Duosheng, Guo Rensheng, and more than 40 others, arrived in Beijing from Chongqing on the 8th by a special transport plane of the Central Transport Corporation to register.

<h3>A Brief History of Marshal Dwight D. Eisenhower: A Superhuman General and First-Rate Diplomat</h3>
<p>General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force who fought across Europe and defeated the powerful German army, was the son of a farmer and engineer from Texas, USA. He had six siblings, and his childhood was spent entirely in a small American town, growing vegetables, raising chickens, and milking cows.</p>
<p>**Once a Laborer and Cattle Herder**</p>
<p>After graduating from Abilene High School, this general, one of America's greatest military leaders, worked as a laborer, a cattle herder, and even a professional baseball player. He later entered West Point Military Academy, but his academic performance was not outstanding, and he once injured his foot playing football.</p>
<p>After graduating in 1915, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and assigned to an infantry unit in Texas. A few months later, when incidents occurred on the Mexican border, he served as a militia instructor.</p>
<p>During World War I, Eisenhower remained in the United States as an instructor, first at an officer training school and later at a tank school. He was assigned to France shortly before the armistice.</p>
<p>Between the last war and this one, he served as an aide to General MacArthur when MacArthur was Chief of Staff. Later, when MacArthur was transferred to the Philippines, he followed him, serving for five years and practicing flying in his spare time. In 1940, Eisenhower returned to the United States and held various positions. In 1941, during US Army exercises, Eisenhower fully demonstrated his talent and was eventually promoted from Colonel to Brigadier General.</p>
<p>On December 7, 1941, five days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Eisenhower was summoned to Washington by Marshall to serve as Director of the Operations Plans Division of the General Staff, where he formulated grand strategies for various theaters of war. Soon after, he was appointed Commander of US Forces in Europe and went to London to work, gaining the cooperation and approval of the British.</p>
<p>**Commanding Allied Forces in the Normandy Landings**</p>
<p>On November 8, 1942, US forces landed in North Africa under Eisenhower's command. Eisenhower traveled to the front lines, working tirelessly. On February 6, 1943, the British and American forces in North Africa merged, and he served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, liberating North Africa and commanding the Allied landings in mainland Italy.</p>
<p>In December 1943, while the Italian campaign was progressing smoothly, he was appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, undertaking the greatest military mission in history. Finally, on June 6, 1944, he commanded the Allied forces to land on the coast of France, crossed the French border, and marched directly into the heart of Germany, forcing Nazi Germany to surrender. This was only eleven months after the Allied forces began their offensive.</p>
<p>In November of the same year, he succeeded Marshal Marshall as Chief of Staff. The following is a record from the New York Times Overseas Weekly regarding his style and activities after taking office:</p>
<p>General Eisenhower recently succeeded General Marshall as the highest-ranking officer in the nation's army. His great achievements are already immortal. His decisive role in strategy and tactics in achieving victory in Europe is an undeniable fact. If a final piece of evidence is needed, then the former German General Staff at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal made it clear that the biggest factor in bringing the proud and powerful Third Reich to its knees was none other than Eisenhower's superhuman generalship.</p>
<p>**Marshal Marshall's Successor**</p>
<p>President Truman once told a visitor that he considered Eisenhower "our first-rate diplomat." The President's selection of him as Marshall's successor was undoubtedly related to this important understanding, because in the next few years, dealing with the people and resolving the contradictions and disorder in US military policy is the main task of the Chief of Staff. The US Army will clearly shoulder an unprecedentedly important task in the world situation, with a nature that is far more diplomatic than preparing for war.</p>
<p>General Eisenhower, bearing the heavy responsibility of Chief of Staff, must fulfill two broad tasks. First, in addition to the "commanding the army" which is his obvious job, he must provide advice on all policies related to military affairs to the Secretary of the Army, the President, and Congress. Second, he must be responsible for implementing the policies established or specialized by the army in the future. He insists on his right to argue and disagree within the scope of his advisory authority, but he believes that it is his responsibility to earnestly implement policies that have already been established and require his execution.</p>
<p>All important actions and decisions in the army are carried out in the name of the Chief of Staff, so the responsibility for careful consideration after each important decision rests on his shoulders. Naturally, this matter involves a wide range of issues, and it is impossible for him to weigh and make decisions on so many complex problems (and many highly technical ones). Therefore, a set of daily tasks is very important.</p>
<p>**Handling Problems with Wisdom and Decisiveness**</p>
<p>In the first few weeks of his tenure, many things had already been sorted out and simplified by his staff. They all praised Eisenhower's wisdom and decisiveness in handling complex problems.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem he dealt with every day was demobilization. He had instructed his staff to conduct research to understand the most dangerous aspect of the problem. He was paying attention to the extent to which the disbandment of American troops would reveal military weakness, to what extent the United States would lose prestige, and the impact on order and stability in other parts of the world. This stability and order were originally exchanged with great sacrifices in the war.</p>
<p>Eisenhower had to use all his generalship and diplomatic skills to prevent excessive demobilization and to reduce the pressure from people on Congress to "bring our boys home." This can be evidenced by a conversation he had with one of his staff members after the war.</p>
<p>"We didn't fight this war to maintain the status quo, but to improve some terrible situations. If I don't believe that a strong America is the greatest contribution to world peace, I would at most work for five minutes in this job."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Considering the severe Communist disaster in Subei, where nine out of ten houses are empty and refugees fill the roads, and according to investigations, more than three million refugees have fled, exposed to the elements and awaiting food, people from Subei residing in Nanjing held a meeting at the Gongyu Association at 9:00 AM on the 8th to discuss countermeasures and decided to organize a Refugee Relief Association to discuss fundraising and relief measures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The severe drought and famine in Chaoshan have caused a serious disaster, with rice once reaching 160,000 yuan per picul. Despite various rescue efforts, rice still costs 130,000 yuan per picul. Deaths are occurring in succession, and starving people are everywhere. People from the region living in Shanghai have repeatedly sent telegrams seeking to raise funds to purchase grain for transport. However, Shanghai has banned the export of rice, and transshipment methods and flour exports have also recently been prohibited. After an emergency meeting of all fellow villagers, representatives were sent to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food to allow purchases from producing areas for relief. Today, they also participated in the talks convened by President Song, Secretary-General Wu, and the Ministry of Food on relief for the grain shortage in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] Today, the "Central News Agency" reported that 1,840 people have starved to death in Hengyang city. If relief supplies cannot be delivered in time, another 440,000 people will also die, and there are 6,000 homeless children wandering the streets.</p>

<h3>The Famine Situation in Guangxi is Severe; National Assembly Representatives from Guangxi Province Report in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Guangxi Province, located in the remote southwest and having supported the war of resistance under enemy devastation, is now mired in extreme famine. According to the Guangxi Provincial Government's investigation of the total losses from the war of resistance, the scope of losses includes 80 counties and cities, 679,794 households, and property losses of 363,872,196,000 yuan, an average loss of more than 500,000 yuan per household. The loss of rice and miscellaneous grains is estimated at 17,378,847 piculs, while the province's annual need is said to be 56 million piculs. However, the grain production in 1945 was only 25 million piculs due to war losses and natural disasters, enough to supply only a little over five months before the grain was exhausted. Some are using rice water as porridge, and those without rice are replacing it with tree bark and grass roots. In terms of grain prices, rice recently in the Guilin and Liuzhou areas has reached over 70,000 yuan per picul (100 catties), and there are more than three million starving people in the province. Although the provincial government and the relief branch have concentrated all their efforts on urgent relief and work-relief loans, it is all just a drop in the bucket and does not help. The representatives from Guangxi attending the National Assembly have repeatedly appealed to the government and will report the disaster situation in Guangxi in great detail to the press tonight, leaving listeners deeply saddened.</p>

<h3>Two Male and Female Cultural Traitors Are Indicted Separately by the Jiangsu High Procuratorate</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 8th] Wan Mengwan, a female traitor and the principal of the false National Model Girls' Middle School, graduated from the Department of Education of the National Peiping Normal University and studied at Waseda University in Japan. After the outbreak of the war of resistance, she returned to China, first living in Hong Kong and then in Shanghai. In 1941, she went to Nanjing and held a false position for as long as four years. After being reported by the Education Department's special commissioners in Nanjing and Shanghai, she was arrested and sent to the Suzhou High Court Procuratorate. After the investigation was concluded, it was believed that although Wan claimed that her half-heartedness was due to difficult living conditions, since she lived in Hong Kong and was registered in Yunnan, why did she not go to the interior to serve the country? It was clear that she was willing to be a traitor, so she was indicted yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 8th] Ji Guo'an, a traitor and the director of the false Central University Affiliated Middle School, graduated from the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of the National Peiping Normal University. In 1940, he was invited by Fan Zhongyun to go to Nanjing from Luan County, Hebei Province, to take a false position. He was arrested by the Army Headquarters and sent to the Suzhou High Court Procuratorate. After the investigation was concluded, it was believed that Ji followed the regulations of the false government, adopted newly compiled textbooks, and promoted false education. However, Ji had helped graduates of the false school go to the interior to study, which could be considered during the trial, but it cannot be considered innocent, so he was indicted on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Capital High Court Procuratorate indicted the following traitors on the 8th: Pan Zeyuan, the chief of the General Staff Office of the false Capital Garrison Command, and Cao Zilong, a special agent of the Special Affairs Office of the false Capital Police Headquarters. Pan became an enemy and a traitor in the spring of 1943, betraying the motherland. He was shot by patriotic people in March 1944, but he still did not repent. He was appointed as the director of training at the false Central University and a chief inspector of the false Capital Police Headquarters. Cao served as an official in the Dalian Jianghai Customs, the false Jiangsu Songjiang Security Brigade, and the Special Affairs Office of the false Capital Police Headquarters, helping the tiger to harm his compatriots, and his crime was extremely heinous.</p>
<h3>The Full Text of the Indictment of Wang Yitang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 8th] The Hebei High Court Procuratorate recently filed an indictment against the traitor Wang Yitang. The indictment stated that the defendant Wang Yitang was a Jinshi in the Qing Dynasty. After the July 7th Incident, when the Japanese army invaded Peiping, he followed the instructions of the enemy army and organized a false temporary government with the late traitors Wang Kemin, Tang Erhe, Zhu Shen, and others, serving as a member and Minister of the Relief Department. In September 1938, he was transferred to Minister of the Interior, still concurrently handling relief affairs. In March 1940, he took office as the president of the Old Examination Yuan of the Nanjing false national government. In June of the same year, he served as the chairman of the false North China Political Affairs Commission and concurrently as the Director-General of the General Administration and the President of the New People's Association. He was dismissed from his post on February 9, 1943. After the victory of the war of resistance, he was arrested, interrogated, and detained by the Peiping Camp of the Military Affairs Commission. He was sent to the court for detailed investigation. Regarding the most significant acts of communication with enemy countries during his tenure in false positions, they are briefly described as follows: (1) Advocated the joint performance of the enemy and puppet regimes, the construction of a new order in East Asia, and the completion of the so-called holy war, leading the civil and military officials and the people under his jurisdiction to cooperate with enemy countries. (2) Launched the New People's Movement, loudly advocating the New People's Spirit, suppressing the patriotic thoughts and national consciousness of the people. (3) Propaganda for the enemy's military achievements, expressing pro-Japanese sentiments, and changing the people's trust. (4) Held five security enhancement campaigns, intending to eliminate the activities of our underground work, resulting in countless innocent civilians being harmed. (5) Used his powers to supply the enemy with food, money, and other materials, increasing the enemy's combat power. (6) Deceived the people, loudly calling for hard work and increased production, but in fact, a large amount of the collected materials were sent to the enemy army. (7) Signed a comprehensive survey contract with the enemy, allowing the enemy to survey all materials within North China. (8) Implemented an economic blockade, cutting off the input of materials into the war of resistance area, willingly helping the enemy and reducing the strength of the war of resistance. (9) Established an intelligence bureau to detect and leak information related to our country's military, political, and economic affairs. (10) Supplied the enemy with labor to transport military supplies and other military manual labor. (11) Recruited and expanded the army, falsely claiming to strengthen security and eliminate bandits, but in reality, suppressing the local population. (12) Increased the issuance of banknotes by the United Reserve Bank, disrupting finance. In summary, the above has been confessed by the defendant himself and clarified by the investigation and statistics bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, and the facts are clear. It is sufficient to prove that the defendant harmed the country and the people, made every effort to please the enemy, increased the combat power of the enemy army, and reduced the effectiveness of our country's war of resistance. It is clear that he colluded with the enemy country and betrayed his own country. His crime is unforgivable and should be dealt with in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and Items 10 and 13 of the Punishment of Traitors Regulations, Article 2, Paragraph 1 and Item 9 of the Traitors Regulations, Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law to file a public prosecution.</p>

<h3>Emergency Repairs to the Yellow River Dike Undertaken: Executive Yuan Actively Deploys, Communist Party Suddenly Reverses Prior Agreement, Opposes Simultaneous Closing of the Breach</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Kaifeng Dispatch: Emergency repairs to the Yellow River dike in preparation for the autumn flood are now being actively deployed.

<h3>Once the Yangtze River Sluice Project is Successful: Ocean Liners Can Directly Reach Chongqing; Power Generation Can Irrigate Tens of Millions of Mu of Farmland in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>[United Press, Portland, 7th] Savage, the world-renowned design director of the Reclamation Bureau, when drafting a detailed plan for the largest Yangtze River sluice in history, found that there was a major problem still confronting him, namely how to find a way to lift ocean liners to a height of 600 feet without using locks. Before leaving for the East, Savage revealed that the Yangtze River sluice would generate five times the electricity of the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States, producing 10,560,000 kilowatts annually, and could irrigate ten million acres of farmland in Hubei Province in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain. The sluice is expected to be built near Yichang, and the power generated will be more powerful than the total power of the Grand Coulee, Shasta, Norris, and Bonneville dams. It will also enable ocean liners to navigate 1,620 miles inland directly to Chongqing. But how to lift the ship over the 600-foot-high sluice is the problem. There is little hope of placing a lock in the center of the famous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Today, the largest lock that can be lifted globally is only 72 feet high, namely the lock of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>Gu Returns to Hometown to Sweep Graves</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu Weijun, who has been busy with national affairs and has achieved remarkable results, took advantage of his visit to Shanghai on the 3rd of this month to return to his hometown of Jiading to sweep the graves and visit relatives and friends. The ambassador's special car arrived in the city around noon. Having been instructed not to engage in extravagance beforehand, his itinerary was extremely secret, so those who greeted him at the station were only local gentry Xu Xinfu, County Magistrate Xu Zhuyi, and a few relatives. After Gu got off the car, he shook hands with those who came to greet him one by one and exchanged pleasantries. At noon, he responded to an invitation from Xu Xinfu of Jiafeng Yarn Factory for a banquet. During the banquet, the ambassador inquired about the elders of the county's revitalizing industries. In the afternoon, Xu accompanied him on a tour of the city, inspecting the local customs and conditions. Residents along the way scrambled to catch a glimpse of his appearance. He then arrived outside the West Gate to sweep the family ancestral hall. Around 4:00 PM, he boarded the original car and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Local Gentry Prepare to Establish County Bank: The county bank in this county was initiated and prepared by Lu Linxun and Xu Xinfu. The founding meeting was held at the Shanghai Vocational Education Society in Shanghai a month ago. The capital of 15 million yuan has also been fully paid in one lump sum. It will open as soon as the Ministry's order is approved.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>

<p>Land No Need to Redivide</p>
<p>The county government previously received an order from the province to coordinate with the new urban plan after the war, and planned to complete the work of redividing the land in the city destroyed during the war in the 35th year of the Republic. It was ordered to comply with the report immediately, so as to select important cities with the greatest damage and value for consolidation to repair or construct first. However, the degree of damage in this county during the war was still light, and there was no need to redivide the land. If the provincial order is followed and redivision is carried out, it will inevitably lead to cutting the feet to fit the shoes, causing difficulties in land administration and autonomous administration. It was telegraphed to the provincial government to request verification.</p>
<p>Refusing the Death Sentence, Requesting Retrial: After Zhang Beisheng, the puppet provincial government's director of civil affairs and special commissioner for rural security, was previously sentenced to death by the High Court, Zhang refused the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. It has been approved and returned for retrial. It is now scheduled to be publicly tried at 9:00 AM on the 24th of this month.</p>

<p>Digging Ten Thousand Wells to Relieve Northern Anhui</p>
<p>The Anhui Relief Branch believes that the counties in northern Anhui are high in altitude, dry in climate, with few trees and little rain, which greatly affects agricultural crops, resulting in poverty. For the sake of fundamental relief, it was decided to dig ten thousand wells to facilitate irrigation. The depth of each well is stipulated to be an average of 21.6 feet, and the water depth is 15.6 feet, which can irrigate 51 mu to 56 mu. The cost of labor and materials is about 315,000 yuan. Personnel have been dispatched to Fuyang, Linquan, Taihe, Woyang, Hao County, Mengcheng, and Yingshang counties to survey and carry out digging. It is expected that all will be completed by the end of August next year. According to provincial government news, the United Relief Agency has sent American Colonel White, as the representative stationed in Anhui, who led five staff members from Shanghai via Wu to Hehe on the 4th to supervise relief matters and carry 900 tons of flour and a large number of medicines to benefit the disaster victims.</p>

Section Chief Liu explained the details of the compilation of the actual tax collection register for the 35th year of the Republic, and it must be completed and sent to the government within 20 days. The name of the compilation book was changed to register, and it was ordered to follow the old east and west cabinets as the scope of the office, and two directors and deputy directors were recommended, and it was learned that Zhou Tingchu and Qi Shoulian were recommended as the directors, and Xu Zhongping and Huang Wenji as the deputy directors.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Opening of the Trial of Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>The international tribunal for the trial of Japanese war criminals opened in Tokyo on the 3rd of this month. The Japanese war criminals on trial include 28 people, including Tojo, Doihara, and Hata Shunroku, all key figures in wartime Japan. They used to issue orders to invade our China and launch the Pacific War. Now they have all bowed their heads as prisoners, awaiting the judgment of this international tribunal. Among these 28 defendants, almost all are chief culprits in the invasion of China. Just looking at the list of these war criminals, which one has not had a vicious hand in the aggression against China: Hideki Tojo, Kenji Doihara, Shunroku Hata, Kiichirō Hiranuma, and Kōki Hirota. China has been invaded by Japan for the longest time and has suffered the most severely. Naturally, it is more concerned about the trial of these war criminals than other countries. At this international tribunal's opening in Tokyo, the seat occupied by our Judge Mei Ruao was second only to the presiding judge, which shows how other countries understand the position China occupies in the trial of Japanese war criminals. Our eight years of bloody war, no, it's simply the humiliation suffered over the past fifty years, is now washed away with the opening of the international tribunal. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the trial of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<p>This international tribunal opened on May 3rd and continued until the 6th when the presiding judge announced the adjournment until June 3rd for the formal trial. The opening of this international tribunal lasted only three days. Its significance lies in announcing the formal establishment of this tribunal and accepting the trial of Japanese war criminals. The war criminals present all echoed in unison, claiming "not guilty." The public trial will continue, pending after June 3rd. During this month, the judges of the international tribunal can fully study the indictment filed by the prosecutor, so that they can fully understand the key points of the indictment at the next public trial. During the three days of the opening of the international tribunal, we saw the following description by a reporter from the United Press: "Japanese war criminals attempted to use their usual cunning methods to defend their lives during the trial today. Although this method is similar to that of seizing power twenty years ago, the trickery remains the same, but the power of the past no longer exists. They claim 'not guilty' for the series of heinous crimes they are accused of, and their situation is still like the arrogant Night Saburo, disregarding everything. However, these people are haggard, their clothes are bloated, and they no longer bark well. Even the voices accustomed to issuing orders, such as the arrogant Hiroshi Oshima or the stubborn Kenryo Sato, had no effect on the listeners when they uttered the words 'not guilty.'" We have not read the original text of the indictment of the international tribunal prosecutor, so we cannot comment on it, but it is not beyond our expectations that the chief culprits of such aggression claim "not guilty" to the points of the indictment. However, the criminals' attempt to use cunning means to wash away their deserved crimes only reveals their hideous faces. Given the seriousness of their crimes, there is no doubt that the international tribunal should impose the punishment they deserve after the trial is over. However, the court hearing in the past three days has a few points worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The points worthy of our attention are: (1) Tojo's lawyer questioned the jurisdiction of the international tribunal; (2) Tojo and other war criminals attempted to escape their responsibilities by using the excuse that Japan's operations were "self-defense;" (3) Pointing out that dropping the atomic bomb was "murder," attempting to reduce their crimes. The news reports about how Tojo's lawyer questioned the jurisdiction of the international tribunal are vague, and we have not yet seen the whole picture. However, since this question has been raised, the scope it may include is not small. For example, whether the existence of the tribunal itself is legal; what the powers of the tribunal are, whether it has the power to hear such cases; and, according to telegrams, the judges who have actually investigated Japanese crimes have a prejudice and should recuse themselves, etc. These seem to be purely legal issues, and their role may be to overthrow the existence of the tribunal itself, or to restrict the power of the tribunal, in order to fundamentally overthrow the trial of these war criminals. All of these are manifestations of Japan's inherent cunning. If we pursue it further, there is no legal basis at all. For these so-called legal disputes, the court will inevitably make a clear announcement when it reopens in the future, which goes without saying. From the standpoint of a third party, our view on these points of contention is: Japan having accepted the Potsdam Declaration of unconditional surrender, General MacArthur took possession of Japan as the supreme commander of the Allied forces, that is, even the Emperor of Japan must be subject to his jurisdiction; the establishment of this international tribunal is based on MacArthur's instructions, and is naturally a legal institution with full power to try Japanese war criminals. The points raised by Tojo and other defense lawyers are completely without merit.</p>
<p>There were two views on the trial and punishment of war criminals: one believed that a country's operation is the inevitable continuation of a country's national policy; war is the inevitable result of the conflict of national policies; therefore, military and political leaders are only servants of the country and do not bear legal responsibility. According to this statement, even the term "war criminal" is still a question; the other statement believes that a country's operation is decided more by the private intentions of military and political leaders and less by the public will of the people, especially in the case of aggressive wars. According to this, "war criminals" bear a dual legal responsibility to the inside and outside. Aggressing against other countries and destroying peace should bear the responsibility of international law, and using the people to fight should bear the internal legal responsibility. Since this World War was an aggressive all-out war, the main figures who started this war should be punished by law as "war criminals," which is naturally unquestionable. Because these war criminals have been subjected to legal sanctions, the concept of the international rule of law has been strengthened, and strict norms have been established for future international relations. If we condone the chief culprits of the war of aggression without imposing legal sanctions, then who can respect the dignity of international law! Therefore, Japanese war criminals must be severely punished.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese war criminals are beginning to be tried. The judges of the international tribunal are all legal authorities from their respective countries, and they will naturally conduct a fair trial of these war criminals who started the war. What we feel is a pity is that although 28 war criminals are on trial this time, there are still many chief culprits and accomplices who are still at large. Whether the Emperor should also be regarded as a war criminal is another question, which we will not discuss now. People like Nobuyuki Abe and Yoshio Ayukawa, either participated in the war against China, or lent a hand to the warlords to develop our Northeast resources for the purpose of aggression, are all undeniably guilty. They should also be subjected to legal sanctions in the same way, so that all those who participated in the aggression can be brought to justice, and the guarantee of lasting world peace in the future can be achieved. We believe that the prosecutor of the international tribunal will be able to bring all these criminals who participated in the aggression to justice. That is very relevant to ensuring lasting peace.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Will End Hastily; Peace Conference to Be Held Next Month; British and Soviet Foreign Ministers Scheduled to Return Home on Saturday</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] London, 8th (Broadcast): The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will conclude before Saturday. Today's meeting decided to submit a report on the achievements already made and to leave major issues, such as Italian reparations, to be handled "diplomatically". If the foreign ministers can reach an understanding on drafting peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland within the next month, a peace conference of twenty-one countries (including India) will be held in Paris on June 15. The US representative believes that the peace conference must be held regardless of whether the four foreign ministers can reach an understanding. Molotov is considering this point.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] London, 8th (Broadcast): The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has been in session for several days. Apart from a few minor issues that have been agreed upon, discussions on other major issues have yielded no results due to the wide divergence of opinions between the Soviet and American sides. Today, there is a phenomenon of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference adjourning early. At today's meeting, the Balkan disputes were not discussed, and the discussion suddenly turned to the future of Germany (the redistribution of the Rhineland and Ruhr regions). It is expected that various issues will be briefly discussed thereafter, avoiding major decisions and adjourning early. (Another Dispatch) Molotov and Bevin are scheduled to leave Paris and return home on Saturday.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] British sources revealed today that US Secretary of State Byrnes has proposed that the task of drafting European peace treaties be transferred to the twenty-one-nation peace conference opening here on June 15, as the four foreign ministers have not reached a consensus on the key points of the peace treaties. However, according to a US representative, the four foreign ministers will continue their meetings until next week at the earliest. Details of the debate following Byrnes' proposal are unknown, but it is rumored that the other three foreign ministers replied that they must consult their respective governments. It is also rumored that Byrnes proposed that the four foreign ministers send representatives to list the points on which agreement has been reached and the points on which opinions still differ into two tables, which has been accepted by the other three foreign ministers. Unofficial sources say that once this table is completed, it will be clear that the UK and the US disagree with the Soviet Union on every key point. At this morning's Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, opinions on Italian reparations also differed between the Soviet, French, and American sides, resulting in a stalemate. At the same time, British and French officials are currently meeting to harmonize their views on the Ruhr and Rhineland regions.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference held a meeting this morning to discuss the peace treaty issues with the Balkan countries and has reached the following agreements: (1) Hungary will return the entire area of ​​Outer Transylvania to Romania; (2) the border between Romania and Bulgaria will be restored to its pre-war state; (3) the border between the Soviet Union and Romania will remain as it is, that is, the Bessarabia region and the northern part of Bukovina will remain under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union. No agreement has been reached on the issue of international control of navigation on the Danube River. In the afternoon, the four foreign ministers continued their meeting to discuss the peace treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. Regarding Bulgaria, it was decided to temporarily restore the 1938 borders, which will be re-discussed at the formal peace conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi completed his official business here and returned to Rome this morning.</p>
<h3>The Security Council Resumed Yesterday; Discussion of Whether the Iranian Issue Should Be Withdrawn; The US Holds Documents of Soviet Interference in Iran's Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] London, 8th (Broadcast): The Security Council will reconvene in a few hours. It is still unknown whether the discussion of the Iranian issue will be suspended. However, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation's special correspondent's inquiry from the Iranian representative, the representative has not yet received formal notification from his government regarding the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] The US holds a secret file on alleged Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs, but will not present it as evidence when the United Nations Security Council meets today (without the Soviet representative present) to discuss whether to withdraw the Iranian issue. According to a senior official, existing US evidence supports Iran's complaints against the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Women's Subcommittee Resolves to Implement Monogamy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women resolved today that women worldwide should have the right to divorce, vote, hold public office, freedom to choose marriage, and the universal implementation of monogamy.

<h3>Indian Army Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Simla</h3>
<p>Round Table Conference Reopens Today</p>
<p>Prospects Still Not Optimistic</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Simla, 6th] Well-informed sources believe that the arrival of Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck in Simla and his meeting with the Governor-General last night are of great significance. The content of the talks will certainly not be disclosed in the future, but political analysts point out that, in this matter, the talks may involve the following two issues: (1) Assuming that the tripartite talks cannot reach a result and riots are about to occur, the position of the Indian Army is extremely important, as maintaining law and order is ultimately the responsibility of the Indian Army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Simla, 8th] The talks between the British Cabinet Mission and the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, originally scheduled for 3 pm today, have been postponed to 3 pm tomorrow as the Congress and the Muslim League still need to consider the British proposals.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, Simla, 7th] The British-Indian conference is in danger of breaking down. The British Cabinet Mission is making every effort to reach an agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League and is currently trying to formulate a revised plan to submit to the representatives at the resumed meeting. The Cabinet Mission has invited Gandhi to assist in formulating the above plan.</p>
<h3>Political Parties' Prejudices Deepen; Japanese Political Situation Remains Unresolved; Struggle for Power Causes MacArthur to Become Impatient; Hatoyama May Be Listed as a War Criminal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Authoritative sources revealed today that MacArthur's headquarters has conducted a careful investigation and that Hatoyama, the president of the Liberal Party, may soon be charged as a war criminal, and Japanese officials implementing the political purge will be disqualified. MacArthur has gradually become annoyed by the long-standing unresolved Japanese political situation and the failure of the Japanese government to fully implement the purge. At the same time, Japanese political leaders have been trying to resolve party disputes in order to form a new cabinet for many days, but now it seems that prejudices have deepened, and the hope of forming a cabinet is as slim as when Shidehara's cabinet was in chaos. In addition, MacArthur's headquarters is also closely investigating the past activities of Cabinet Secretary-General Narahashi, and the investigation may result in his disqualification from holding public office. Observers at headquarters and the Japanese people recognize that the political stalemate is due to the fact that political leaders are vying for old power.</p>
<h3>The Liberal Party Reorganizes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] After MacArthur pointed out that the Liberal Party's leader, Hatoyama, was not qualified to serve as Prime Minister, the party has secretly and quietly reorganized and now seems ready to return to the political stage, and elect a new party leader and propose a candidate for Prime Minister. The party has decided to appoint Shigeru Yoshida or Tsuneo Matsudaira, a long-retired diplomat, as the new party leader.</p>
<h3>Ten More Japanese War Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that ten more war suspects have been detained in Sugamo Prison from April 30 to May 3, including former Lieutenant General Yuichiro Nagano. Their crime is the illegal use of hospital ships.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Philippine President-elect Roxas, accompanied by US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt, is scheduled to stop briefly at Atsugi Airport at 11 pm tonight to refuel en route to Seattle. MacArthur will send representatives to the airport to meet him.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Prestige Grows</h3>
<p>Japanese Women See Him as a "God"</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] According to the United Nations Command, Marshal MacArthur's prestige among the Japanese people is growing. The number of letters MacArthur receives is increasing day by day, and many of them are from women. Some women regard him as a "god", and some women hope for a long-term occupation of Japan to promote the realization of democracy in Japan.</p>
<h3>Afghan Prime Minister Resigns</h3>

<h3>Allied Forces in Europe Celebrate the First Anniversary of Victory in Europe with Military Reviews</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Allied forces in various countries in Europe participated in reviews today to celebrate the first anniversary of Victory in Europe. After the celebration, the troops in the Mediterranean region were given a day off. Allied Supreme Commander Lieutenant General Morgan reviewed British, American, and Polish troops near Naples. A victory parade was also held in Vienna, and grand victory celebrations were held in Prague and Belgrade.</p>
<h3>Personnel Engaged in Atomic Bomb Testing Depart from the US for Bikini Atoll; Testing Fleet Also Sets Sail for the Marshall Islands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 7th, United Press] The personnel engaged in public atomic bomb testing today departed from various ports in California on three ships, heading for Bikini, where the atomic bombs will be tested this summer. The group includes various scientific experts who will measure the million-degree heat, the astonishing pressure, and the intense radiation of the atomic bomb. The 74 ships of the US Army and Navy special forces testing atomic bomb fleet have set sail for the Marshall Islands, including the battleship "Nevada", which was built 30 years ago. The ship, painted in bright orange, will be the target of the first test to be held around July 1. The second surface test or underwater test will be held within three weeks after the first test.</p>
<p>The US Decides to Invite Various Countries to Observe the Test at That Time</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson declared today that when the atomic bomb is tested at Bikini Atoll, it is planned to invite countries participating in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, such as the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, China, France, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Poland, to send representatives and journalists to observe. Acheson also solemnly stated that although various countries are invited to observe, the entire test is only a plan of the US government and is not a joint or international test.</p>
<p>Various Speculations About the Reason for the Postponement of the Test</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman has postponed the date of the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test from May 15 to July 1. Initially, various countries thought that the US was doing this for the sake of world peace, and that the postponement would give the United Nations organization more opportunities to eliminate the world's fear of another great war. Some people in Congress even advocated canceling the test, believing that it was meaningless to waste 100 million dollars and sink 100 warships to prove that the atomic bomb is the most destructive weapon. However, military scientists pointed out that another possible reason for the postponement is that new recording instruments are still being developed, and the testing plan may also be changed.</p>
<p>The Bomb Dropped into the Water Will Be Tied with a Cable</p>
<p>The second atomic bomb was originally scheduled to explode on the surface of the water, but now it is planned to explode underwater. According to experts, an explosion in the shallow water surrounded by coral reefs is more similar to the actual bombing of a fleet at anchor. A bomb exploding at a depth of 25 to 50 feet is like a time-delayed mine placed by a submarine or a depth charge dropped by an aircraft. Bikini Atoll has several places that are 180 feet deep. When this plan is implemented, the bomb will be tied with a cable and suspended under a boat, and the explosion will be triggered by a timed fuze. At that time, the explosion on the surface of the water will cause a great shock and will definitely cause the ship to break. Experts say that this change can be adopted. However, the third scheduled experiment will not change in any way and will still be exploded in the deep sea.</p>
<p>US Scientists Discover a Method to Tame the Atom</p>
<p>US scientists have discovered a method to tame the atom, making plutonium and uranium 235 no longer usable for making bombs, but only for industrial use. The diplomatic difficulties of international control of atomic secrets may be opened up as a result, and the era of commercial utilization of atomic energy may be realized sooner. It is said that after losing its explosive effect, it is not easy to restore its original properties. A member of the US Senate Atomic Energy Committee said: If this kind of "denaturation" can be implemented, the issue of joint management of atomic secrets will be "greatly simplified". If the supply of all fissionable materials can be strictly controlled and processed so that they cannot be used militarily, there is no need to fear the secret manufacture of atomic bombs. The committee has also studied the State Department's proposal to establish an international licensing system to control the raw materials and production of atomic energy.</p>

<h3>Major Strategic Decision by Britain; British Troops Stationed in Egypt Begin to Withdraw; First Batch of Military Supplies Arrives in Haifa; Full Withdrawal Will Take Five Years</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Haifa, 8th] British troops have now begun to withdraw from Egypt. The first batch of heavy military equipment was shipped from Egypt to Haifa yesterday by the British warship "Dunkirk Bacon". In the coming months, ships will continue to transport military equipment to Haifa. A diplomatic correspondent of this agency in London believes that Britain's announcement that it is willing to give up Egypt is actually the most important strategic decision that Britain has ever taken. This decision was made to meet Egypt's desire for independence and to adjust the empire's security relations in the Middle East.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Highly qualified sources observed tonight that Egypt's position is actually a strategic link between the east and west parts of the British Empire. It will take at least five years for British troops to completely withdraw from Egypt. The discussion of the British withdrawal does not mean that this matter can be completed in a year or two. According to an expert, even if the withdrawal begins immediately, it will take at least five years to completely remove the army and navy equipment and to completely withdraw the troops. Transporting all the equipment will require 700 trains with 15 to 20 cars each.</p>

<h3>Trotsky's Posthumous Work "Stalin" Published; Claims Stalin is an Opportunist</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] Stalin's political enemy Trotsky died of assassination in Mexico City six years ago. His posthumous work "Stalin" was one-third completed at the time of his death. The editor and translator of the book, Max Eastman, collected his notes and manuscripts and completed a huge work on his behalf. It was originally prepared for publication at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but it was decided to postpone it, and today it was published by Harper &amp; Brothers. In the preface, Trotsky described Stalin as neither a thinker, a writer, nor an eloquent speaker. His control of the real power of the Soviet Union was not due to his personal ability, but entirely due to an organization. Trotsky also said that Stalin was the son of a cobbler in a Georgian village, or of Mongolian descent. He had revolutionary ideas at the age of fifteen and made it his life's mission to overthrow authority, but his motive was more hatred of authority than love for the oppressed. His tenacity and vindictiveness were mutually reinforcing. Trotsky also said that Stalin was always a politician of intermediate roads, an opportunist in strategy, and a revolutionary in means, a revolutionary who used bombs. Trotsky also raised many questions in the book, including whether Stalin was related to Lenin's death in 1924.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the First Anniversary of Germany's Surrender: A Retrospective on the Rise and Fall of the Nazis - Special Compilation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a year ago—May 8th—Germany officially announced its unconditional surrender, ending the first half of World War II. To commemorate the first anniversary of Germany's surrender, it would be meaningful to provide a comprehensive retrospective on the rise and fall of Germany over the twelve years from its ascent to its demise, allowing us to understand the origins and trajectory of militarism.</p>
<p>On January 30, 1933, German President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany. Exploiting the "Reichstag fire" incident, he purged all dissenting elements in one fell swoop. After Hindenburg's death, he immediately became the leader of Germany.</p>
<p>After Hitler came to power, he actively promoted rearmament. In March 1935, Hitler suddenly announced that he did not recognize the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles regarding German armaments and simultaneously announced the restoration of the German conscription system.</p>
<p>On March 7, 1936, Germany suddenly marched into the Rhineland. On May 5th, Addis Ababa fell. On October 24th, Germany and Italy formed the Axis alliance. On November 17th, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, and soon Mussolini also added his name.</p>
<p>On March 11, 1938, Hitler presented Austria with an ultimatum, demanding the resignation of Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. Two days later, Inquart, the leader of the Austrian Nazi Party, took office as Chancellor and announced the annexation with Germany. Hitler wiped out a country without bloodshed.</p>
<p>Harboring ambitions, Hitler, through threats and inducements, signed the Munich Agreement with Britain and France on October 1st of the same year. Mussolini also signed as an intermediary. Thus, Hitler disarmed another country without firing a shot.</p>
<p>On March 14, 1939, German troops occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and Czechoslovakia was thus destroyed.</p>
<p>On August 23rd of the same year, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was suddenly announced, and Poland's position was shaken. On September 1st, the German army launched a massive invasion of Poland, and the historically unprecedented and brutal war—World War II—began.</p>
<p>On September 3rd, Britain, based on the military alliance signed between Britain and Poland, immediately declared war on Germany, and France followed suit. On September 27th, Warsaw fell.</p>
<p>On April 9, 1940, German troops invaded Denmark and Norway. On May 10th, German troops invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. At this time, Churchill succeeded Chamberlain as Prime Minister of Britain.</p>
<p>On May 29th, the British army retreated from Dunkirk, which was a disaster for Britain in the early stages of the war.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the chaos, Italian Mussolini declared war on Britain and France on June 10th. The beautiful capital of France—Paris—fell into the hands of the German army on June 14th. On June 22nd, Pétain and Germany signed an armistice agreement in the Forest of Compiègne, and France thus surrendered to Germany.</p>
<p>After Germany conquered France, it continued to invade other parts of Europe: On April 16, 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia and Greece; on June 22nd, German troops invaded the Soviet Union, and the German-Soviet war began; on December 6th, German troops reached 30 miles outside of Moscow, the Soviet army launched a large-scale counter-offensive at the crucial moment, by the end of January 1941, the Soviet army had pushed the German army back to the front line three months prior.</p>
<p>At the end of January 1943, the Soviet Union announced the annihilation of all German troops attacking Stalingrad. On May 13th, the North African campaign ended, and all German troops surrendered. On July 12th, the Soviet army launched a full-scale counter-offensive, and since then, they advanced rapidly and irresistibly. On January 4, 1944, the Soviet army crossed the old eastern border of Poland, on April 2nd, they attacked Romania, on June 4th, they liberated Rome, and at the same time, American planes began to shuttle bombing Germany.</p>
<p>On August 23rd of the same year, Romania declared war on Germany, on August 25th, Paris was liberated, on September 11th, American troops entered Germany, and from September 22nd to October 25th, Soviet troops successively entered Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Czechoslovakia, East Prussia, and Norway.</p>
<p>From February 4th to 11th, 1945, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Chairman Stalin met in Yalta on the Crimean Peninsula to determine the principles for resolving the German problem.</p>
<p>On February 13th of the same year, Soviet troops occupied Budapest, the capital of Hungary; on March 21st, German troops in the Saar region were cleared out.</p>
<p>On April 3rd of the same year, the Western Allies began to advance rapidly in all directions on the German plains, on April 13th, Soviet troops occupied Vienna, and on April 16th, the Western Allies reached the Czech border.</p>
<p>On April 25th, Soviet troops reached the center of Berlin, and American and Soviet troops met in Torgau. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union held a conference in San Francisco to discuss and determine the organizational rules and regulations of post-war peace institutions.</p>
<p>On May 1st, the news of Mussolini's execution was confirmed, and Germany announced Hitler's death, with Dönitz succeeding as the leader of Germany.</p>
<p>On May 3rd, Stalin announced the occupation of Berlin, and the Allied forces occupied Hamburg. On the same day, German troops in Italy first surrendered unconditionally.</p>
<p>On May 5th, German troops in Denmark and the Netherlands also surrendered completely. Although a small number of German troops within the borders of Czechoslovakia still declared resistance, organized warfare had effectively ceased at this point. Thus, Dönitz, representing Germany, announced an unconditional surrender on May 7th, and the instrument of surrender was signed that day at the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander Eisenhower. On May 8th, the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union officially announced the day of the armistice, and the first half of the world war thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Churchill Delivers a Speech: Advocates Understanding with the Soviet Union, Upholds the United Nations Charter for Joint Security - Will the World and Humanity Suffer Another Calamity?</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Former British wartime Prime Minister Churchill received the honorary citizenship of the Borough of Westminster yesterday and delivered a speech at the ceremony, urging the pursuit of good and genuine understanding with the Soviet Union through the United Nations framework. He stated, in essence, that some advocate for abandoning Palestine and India, but the British people and the world must deeply consider the consequences of such actions and pay attention to how millions of men and women can be spared from calamities such as those in Europe. Today, China still faces this threat, and its people suffer endlessly. We sincerely hope that all those dedicated to the world can uphold the United Nations charter and its principles to achieve the ultimate goal of peace. If the United Nations, after achieving victory in suppressing fascism and Nazism, reverts to a situation of hostility between two major social ideologies, what will the consequences be? This is a major question for which the people of the world are seeking an answer. If no answer is found, humanity will again be plunged into the depths of suffering, and the pain will be even greater than before. The greatest hope now lies solely in seeking a good and genuine understanding with the Soviet Union through the organization of the United Nations. The English-speaking nations and Western European countries must work together towards this goal to avert this calamity and save all the countries of the world.</p>

<h3>Director of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, Jiang Tingfu, Discusses: Emergency Measures Have Been Adopted to Relieve the National Famine, Workers on Relief Projects Receive the Highest Priority</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), met with reporters from various newspapers in the city yesterday. According to him, among the relief materials shipped by UNRRA, wheat flour was the largest in quantity, totaling 200,000 tons. Due to the severe famine in various parts of the country, emergency measures have been taken to expedite transportation by land and water. Workers on disaster relief projects have the highest priority, followed by refugees, and then the general population for fixed rations. When asked by reporters whether flour sales would continue in the city, Jiang stated: In the past, CRRRA implemented unlimited sales, reaching over 70,000 tons, but it did not actually benefit the common people and only allowed unscrupulous merchants to profit. Therefore, it has been decided to stop this practice. As for medical supplies, the amount received is very small, and they are all surplus materials from the US military, so they are of uneven quality. They have now been distributed to various hospitals and church hospitals. Jiang continued: The difficulties and enormous costs of transporting relief materials to various regions are beyond what the outside world can imagine. For example, each UNRRA ship requires as much as 100 million yuan from unloading to warehousing to transshipment. Furthermore, sending refugees back to their hometowns costs 55 yuan per person per kilometer, with monthly expenses reaching 1 billion yuan. The cost of repairing the Yellow River project, in addition to providing tools and food, has already exceeded 3 billion yuan and is expected to exceed 10 billion yuan by the end of July. This huge expenditure relies on the sale of materials by the Department of Finance for compensation. Regarding railways, CRRRA has cooperated with the Ministry of Communications, starting with the Yuehan Railway. Regarding ships, UNRRA has ordered 1,000 ships from the United States on behalf of CRRRA, including 600 barges and 300 military transport ships, which should arrive in China soon. Furthermore, to develop agriculture in the future, UNRRA has agreed to allocate 2,000 plowing machines, 40 of which have already arrived and been distributed to Henan for use. When I was in the United States, I requested 500,000 tons of artificial fertilizer from the United States, but only 10,000 tons were approved. Finally, when asked by reporters whether Hoover's visit to China would lead to greater assistance to our country, Jiang replied that the possibility was very high.</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Physicians' Petition Group Demands Licenses from the Authorities, Unlicensed Dentists Join the Petition to the Capital</h3>
<p>Over 140 unlicensed practicing dentists in the city, because of previous government regulations stipulating that only graduates with diplomas from medical colleges can apply for physician licenses, and because they were all taught by medical transmission, they are unable to obtain licenses, despite having ten or even thirty years of experience. Therefore, yesterday they responded to the unlicensed practicing Western physicians and joined the petition group, scheduled to go to the capital on the evening of the 11th to request the authorities to issue physician licenses through alternative means. The registration office for unlicensed practicing physicians in the city is at No. 4, Lane 7, Baker Road, and the registration office for dentists is at No. 154, New Zha Road. Furthermore, the Shanghai Dental Research Association hosted the press yesterday afternoon at the YMCA in Ba Xianqiao. Dong Chufang reported on the current situation of unlicensed practicing dentists and expressed hope that the government could find alternative solutions to issue licenses to continue serving the community.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Ships Over 400,000 Tons of Supplies to Shanghai</h3>
<p>UNRRA announced that as of today, 49 giant ships are en route, carrying 423,395 tons of relief supplies to Shanghai, transported by a total of 100 transport ships. In addition, there are 22 transport ships carrying 128,000 tons of supplies to other regions, and 49 ships transporting this relief material are still en route to China. Since February of this year, an average of one transport ship has arrived in Shanghai every day.</p>
<h3>Dredging of the Pudong River Increases Gradually</h3>
<p>(Reported by This Newspaper) Due to eight years of silt accumulation, the riverbed of the Pudong River has risen, significantly affecting navigation. The Pudong Dredging Bureau has actively promoted dredging work since the restoration. According to Shi Konghuai, Deputy Director of the Bureau, the dredging volume in the Pudong River in April was 108,000 tons, an increase of 30% compared to March. Before the war, when the Bureau's dredging equipment was complete, the average monthly dredging volume was 250,000 tons, so the dredging work in April reached 43% of the pre-war level. It is hoped that the dredging volume this month will increase to 125,000 tons, reaching half of the pre-war level. Efforts are currently being made to negotiate with relevant parties in Nanjing and Wuhan to recover the Bureau's mud barges and tugboats so that the old appearance can be restored after the dredging equipment is restored. Regarding the Suzhou Creek, the Bureau has recently sent personnel to conduct surveys, which are expected to be completed by the end of May, and then dredging plans will be determined.</p>

<h3>Paper Merchants and Paper Mills Are Extremely Distressed Under a Complex and Confusing Environment - The Supply of Canadian White Newsprint is Still Difficult to Improve</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] A reporter recently visited people in the paper industry and learned that the situation of the paper industry in the city has been bleak and dismal for the past two months, with nothing to boast about. General paper mills in the city are struggling under the following factors: (1) expensive coal, (2) expensive labor, (3) low product prices, (4) limited actual sales, (5) continued arrival of overseas orders, (6) difficulties in transporting goods to other regions. Statistics show that over half of the dozen or so paper mills in the city have suspended operations. While the inventory of paper products is not abundant, the market has not improved due to limited actual sales. Although overseas orders arrive from time to time, the shipping period is uncertain and the amount of goods received is limited, so those holding the goods regard them as rare and are reluctant to sell. In this contradictory environment, paper merchants and paper mills are feeling extremely distressed. Regarding the import of white newsprint, Canada used to be the primary source. After the Pacific War, Canadian paper merchants who originally sold to China shifted their focus to the United States, and many of them signed long-term purchase contracts with the United States for five or ten years. Therefore, the supply of white newsprint to our country cannot be smooth. Even if there is some, it is surplus from the supply to the United States, and most of it is white newsprint below 21.5 inches. It is reported that Canada's production of white newsprint accounts for 70% of the global output. After the war, the production volume did not decrease significantly compared to pre-war levels, but the demand has increased sharply. It is currently estimated that 80% of the white newsprint produced in Canada is used by the United States. If the paper production situation in the United States improves, the supply from Canada to our country is expected to increase. However, this expectation will not materialize until next year. On the one hand, the estimated domestic demand for white newsprint is 30,000 tons per month.</p>

<h3>The First Case Handled by the District Court Involving an American: Trial Concludes, Defense Lawyer States That the Defendant Killed Out of Righteous Indignation… The Court Orders the Verdict to Be Announced on the 14th</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The first criminal case handled by the Shanghai District Court involving an American, namely the case of Wanda, a sailor on the American merchant ship Coolidge, stabbing to death American black man Sproles in front of the brothel established by Li Ruigen at No. 11, Lane 12, Yongding Road on April 8, was tried for the second time at 2:00 PM yesterday by Judge Meng and Clerk Wei Jizheng, Prosecutor Cao Hong. Judicial Police Officer Zhang Ji and Pan Zupeng brought the defendant to court. The Presiding Judge asked: "Did you have the intention to kill Sproles?" The defendant answered: "No." The Presiding Judge asked: "During the last interrogation, you said it was for self-defense, do you have any supporting evidence?" The defendant answered: "Because Sproles had already stabbed Conie, and my coat was also pierced twice by him, I felt that he was dangerous, so it was for self-defense that I stabbed him twice." The Presiding Judge asked: "How did you stab him at that time?" The defendant answered: "When he first stabbed me, I dodged, and then used my left hand to hold the dagger horizontally, and when he stabbed again, I grabbed his chest with my left hand, held the dagger with my right hand, pinned his left hand under my left armpit, and then continued to stab him twice with my right hand, once in the back and another time probably in the shoulder." The Presiding Judge asked: "Were there people around when you stabbed each other?" The defendant answered: "I didn't see anyone." Judge Meng then summoned witness White, who had stayed overnight in the brothel and heard them arguing. He then summoned US Navy Adjutant and Navy Physician Maofei, who stated that the victim was brought on board at 11:40 PM that day, already unconscious, and passed away around 12:00 AM. The fatal wound was on the third rib of the left chest, and the blade penetrated the heart; the other four wounds were definitely not fatal. Afterwards, witnesses Conie, Li Ruigen (brothel madam), and Hu Keming (who lived at No. 619, Broadway, a foreman at the American Hotel, who saw them fighting and called the police) were summoned and testified about what they had seen. The debate was then declared open. First, the prosecutor read the indictment and explained the defendant's criminal behavior. Then, the appointed defense lawyer, Gui Zhongshu, stood up, submitted the defense statement, and began the debate, stating that the defendant had two motives for stabbing: (1) He was driven by righteous indignation because he saw his companion being stabbed; (2) He acted in self-defense because Sproles was attacking. As for chasing after the victim, it was because the defendant's righteous indignation had not subsided. He then presented similar cases ruled by American courts as evidence. He continued, the defendant is only 22 years old, should be in college, but because of his poor family, he received little education; in addition, he had just gone through a major war, and his combative spirit had not been extinguished, so his behavior was inevitably excessive. However, in both interrogations, the defendant did not quibble, which shows that he is honest. Therefore, he asked the court to consider his motives and difficulties and acquit him. The Presiding Judge adjourned the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Three People Injured in a Car Accident</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Zheng Wangqin, 19, a police officer from Fujian, driving a truck with license plate No. U.S.A. 2225343 instead of a "National Shanghai" plate number, was driving along Jing'an Temple Road near the Yuyuan Road intersection at around 6:20 AM yesterday when a taxi driven by Che Binyu and owned by Fei Bingchang came head-on. Both Fei Bingchang and Che Binyu suffered head injuries as a result of failing to avoid the other vehicle. As police officer Zheng Yuqin attempted to flee the scene, he struck and destroyed a rickshaw owned by rickshaw puller Li Genbao who was on the side of the road. Li Genbao approached the modern truck to negotiate compensation, and at this point the truck collided with a tree on the side of the road, and then hit and injured a pedestrian named Wei who broke his right arm. The driver became even more flustered, and drove at high speed toward the Nanjing West Road Tongfu Road intersection despite the condition of the injured parties. He crashed onto the sidewalk and shattered two large windows of the No. 795 Cafe which were valued at over 4 million yuan. Police officers eventually arrived at the scene and detained the driver and the injured parties. They were turned over to the Jing'an Temple branch of the Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>High Court Retries Shari: Testimony of Seven French Witnesses All Favorable to the Defendant</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Shari, the former Deputy Chief of the French Concession Police and Chief of the Political Department, who was accused of collaborating with the enemy, was retried by the High Court yesterday. During the previous trial, the High Court did not allow the defendant to meet with his defense lawyer, and the defendant refused to answer questions. Yesterday morning, when Judge Cao retried the case, the defendant changed his previous arrogant attitude and answered all the questions asked by the judge because he had met with his caretaker Ai Zhenlin beforehand. After asking the defendant about his age and origin, the court questioned seven French witnesses. The testimony of these seven witnesses was all favorable to the defendant. After Judge Cao finished the interrogation, he ordered a postponement of the trial and the defendant was taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Inhuman Brutality: Jiangyin Massacre Case Culprit Scheduled for Trial; Shimodaira Jiro's Heinous Crimes</h3>
<p>The culprit in the Jiangyin Massacre case, former Jiangyin Japanese Military Police unit sergeant Shimodaira Jiro, has been investigated by the military prosecutor of the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the First Pacification District Headquarters. He was formally indicted yesterday. The Military Tribunal will conduct a public trial on the 15th at 3 PM. It is found that the defendant, Shimodaira Jiro, was a sergeant in the Jiangyin Japanese Military Police. During his years of service, he was extraordinarily cruel, especially with a penchant for slaughter, and countless local people were killed by him. He and Saito Katsuji, the leader of his unit, were known as the two major "Demon Kings of Murder." The people of Jiangyin feared them like tigers, and even mentioning them now brings lingering fear. In mid-August of last year, after the enemy army surrendered, the Jiangyin Japanese Military Police unit, upon receiving the news, planned to evacuate first. At that time, the unit still held sixteen captured compatriots. Not only did they not release them immediately, but they decided to execute thirteen of them. Around 12 PM on the 15th of the same month, Wang Zhongcheng, Xu Zhenfang, Yang Xingnong, Shi Akang, Qu Zongzhen, Zhao Haosheng, Gu Ming, Lu Yong, Lin Achun, Lu Acai, Zhang Jinxiu, a Shandong native (name unknown), and Zhang Yuren, a total of thirteen people, were taken from the prison, hands tied behind their backs, and lined up in the square. Among these thirteen people, most were our anti-Japanese comrades. Seeing this situation, knowing they would certainly die, they shouted slogans and sang the national anthem before their execution, bravely facing death to show their unyielding spirit. First, Saito Katsuji took action, wielding a sharp saber and stabbing the victims violently in the chest. After the knife was inserted, he twisted it forcefully and then pulled it out, causing instant death. He continued to stab seven people in this manner. The eighth person was a young man. When Saito Katsuji raised his knife, he unexpectedly shouted loudly, startling Saito Katsuji, whose hand weakened, preventing him from applying the blade, and he retreated in failure. Next, a corporal stepped forward and first cut off the young man's head with a knife, venting his anger, then followed Saito Katsuji's method, stabbing two more people to death. When he pulled the knife out after stabbing the second person, blood spurted out with the knife, so he also stopped and left. Then the defendant, Shimodaira Jiro, continued the killings, also stabbing two people to death in the same manner. When it came to stabbing the thirteenth person, Zhang Yuren, the defendant, because he knew him, saw that the remaining people in the square had retreated, so he used his foot to kick him into the toilet next to the square, allowing him to hide and save his life. On the morning of the 17th of the same month, the Japanese Military Police unit evacuated Jiangyin, and Zhang Yuren was able to survive. The unit commander, Nagaoka Haruyoshi, and Saito Katsuji both fled in fear of punishment afterwards. The defendant was detained by our army in Wuxi and transferred by the Garrison Headquarters of Nanjing and Shanghai to the court for investigation. After summoning Zhang Yuren to court, he recounted the actual situation he witnessed and experienced in detail. Therefore, the defendant was suspected of being a war criminal and should be held responsible for murder, so he was formally indicted according to law.</p>
<h3>Housing Allocation Committee Discusses Allocation Principles; Rejects Illegal Applications Submitted by Organizations</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan held its fifth meeting yesterday at 9 AM. Director Qian Dajun, Deputy Director Huang Boqiao, Committee Members Xu Jilu, Cha Liangjian, Song Siyi, and others were present. Other committee members were held up in Nanjing on official business and could not return in time, so yesterday's meeting only exchanged views on the relevant principles of allocation. Based on the allocation principle of "Central Organizations that Must Conduct Business in Shanghai," the committee rejected illegal applications submitted by organizations. The applications of organizations likely to be allocated housing were retained, and the investigation team will conduct detailed investigations. The committee will then review and allocate the housing. This review process will require several more meetings before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The allocation work is the final step. The five investigation teams of the committee have been investigating the property owners and current occupants since the first of this month. The investigation procedures are quite thorough, requiring detailed records of the number, size, and dimensions of the rooms in the house, the number of occupants, and where they lived previously. This information will be used as a basis for allocation according to actual needs. It is reported that the investigation is proceeding smoothly, and the households being investigated are generally cooperative. However, because the investigation work is extremely complex, it cannot be completed within this month, so the implementation of the allocation cannot be completed in the short term.</p>
<p>The committee closed the acceptance of applications and registration documents the day before yesterday. A total of 600 reports were submitted by property owners, and 1,556 applications were submitted by organizations.</p>
<p>Evictions Abound</p>
<p>According to a responsible party of the committee yesterday, the first to fourth eviction orders for those illegally occupying housing have been issued. Initially, the enforcement personnel will give warnings, and then they will enforce the orders. These four orders involve two residences in a certain area of western Shanghai and two large residences in the Hongkou district. One of the residences is reportedly the former residence of the notorious traitor Chen Chunpu. As of last night, the news was that the people being served with these eviction orders had accepted them and vacated the premises in accordance with the law, resolving the matter satisfactorily. The residences were sealed by the committee to maintain the status quo, awaiting unified allocation.</p>

<h3>The Severe Hunan Disaster Calls for Urgent Relief</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuan</p>
<p>Stripped Bare and Starving, Selling Children to Survive</p>
<p>The Hunan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai held an emergency relief meeting for the Hunan disaster at the New Life Club the day before yesterday. As a Hunanese, I took the time to attend. A fellow provincial, recently arrived from Hunan and working for the United Relief Services, reported on the real situation of the disaster in Hunan: The people of Hunan currently have no houses to live in, no clothes to wear, and even in Hunan, which is known as the "land of fish and rice," there is no food to eat because the fields are barren. The high price of rice is staggering! Many people are filling their stomachs with tree bark, grass roots, and Guanyin clay. Dozens of kinds of wild grasses are being collected for food. The American staff of the United Relief Services have taken photos of specimens of these plants to bring to Shanghai. As for the tragic news of people selling their children to struggle for survival, it can be seen everywhere. Almost every fellow provincial who attended the meeting shed tears upon hearing this. A fundraising campaign is underway, and the donations made on the spot were quite enthusiastic. However, considering the large number of Hunanese in Shanghai, we should fulfill our duty to respect our hometown and contribute money and effort. If you would like to donate, please send it to the Fuxing Industrial Bank, No. 260 Tianjin Road (west end of Shanxi Road), to provide urgent relief. Furthermore, those who sympathize with the disaster in Hunan and are willing to donate will be greatly appreciated. Zhang Yuanxin's address is No. 151 Beijing Road, phone number 17058.</p>

<h3>Magical and Great: Wireless Exhibition Demonstrates Various Devices</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Amateur Radio Association, in order to arouse the public's interest in wireless science and cultivate wireless talents in our country, is holding a wireless exhibition at the Aurora University Auditorium from the day before yesterday until the 12th. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, the manager of the Asia America Corporation, Su Zuguo, the manager of the China Physical and Chemical Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory, Zhu Songling, and various members hosted reporters for a practical demonstration and detailed explanation of various devices. The demonstration was exceptionally brilliant, making everyone deeply aware of the magic and greatness of wireless science.</p>
<p>The exhibits include various machines, some of which are borrowed from the US Information Service and airlines. There are aircraft radio hand-operated and automatic direction finders, which can use ground-based radio stations to find direction within about 100 miles and can also detect secret radio stations. The discriminator was invented during the last war and is secretly installed to distinguish between friendly and enemy aircraft. After a friendly aircraft emits a signal, it will reflect back in ten seconds, otherwise, it is an enemy aircraft. To prevent enemy aircraft from copying it and to avoid falling into a conspiracy, the device is equipped with a bomb, which will explode and destroy the device if it is detected by the enemy. The transport plane is equipped with radar, which can clearly detect enemy aircraft within ten miles, preventing them from approaching. This device uses the principle of mirror reflection to estimate the distance of enemy aircraft by the light spots on the display screen.</p>
<p>The blind landing instrument consists of an indicator and a receiver. After corresponding to the runway end transmitter on the ground, it can identify the direction regardless of the darkness of night or clouds. This machine is not yet equipped on the ground in China. The course instrument can determine the aircraft's position by observing the strength of radio waves. The altimeter is equipped with a transceiver, which can automatically indicate the altitude of the aircraft from the ground. The commander and communicator can both speak on the aircraft. The communicator can transmit and receive sounds up to 500 miles or more. The facsimile receiver can transmit images of books and newspapers from extremely long distances. The front of the recording chemical paper is coated with wax, the back is coated with metal, and the middle is made of carbon. Using fluctuations, words can be transmitted immediately, with clear black and white.</p>
<p>The most interesting is the steel wire recorder. Each roll of steel wire is 20,000 feet long and as thin as a hair. It is wound around the left and right circles separately and passes through a magnet in the middle. When the machine button is turned, the wire can emit sound when it returns. If it passes through another magnetic stone, the sound can be erased, so the steel wire can be used continuously. If you want to preserve the sound, it can be preserved for up to 20 years. This machine was invented in the United States and currently sells for US$1,000 each. There is currently only one such machine in China. Scientist Chen Deliang is currently researching and imitating it.</p>
<p>Each amateur has its own amateur radio station, which can be used to communicate with countries as far away as South America at any time, facilitating the exchange of information and self-introduction. If it is widely established in the future, its contribution to transmitting global news and integrating world friendship will be even more magical and great.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Exchange Student Program Should Continue to Expand, President of the Chinese Students in America Association Remarks</h3>
<p>[New York News Agency, July 7th] Dr. Meng Ye, President of the Chinese Students in America Association, recently traveled to various locations on the West Coast to strengthen the cultural and educational relations between the two groups. Mr. Meng has now returned to New York, saying, "The most exciting phenomenon I have seen in the United States today is the growing awareness of international issues among the American people. I firmly believe that this awareness is of great importance to the future." Mr. Meng was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. The reason for awarding the honorary degree was "Mr. Meng's significant contributions to international education and his considerable achievements in promoting Sino-American relations during his tenure as President of the Chinese Students in America Association." The Chinese Students in America Association is widely recognized by Sino-American figures as the central hub of Sino-American cultural relations. In the past 20 years, the association has spared no effort in promoting Sino-American cultural and educational relations, serving Chinese students studying in the United States, training Chinese technicians, and assisting American educators in studying Chinese issues. Dr. Meng said that his recent trip to the West Coast gave him the opportunity to review the association's current programs and determine its long-term goals for the future. He declared that the American people are very interested in the association's programs, as evidenced by the fact that American industries are sponsoring Chinese students for training. He called for the continued expansion of the student exchange program between Sino-American schools. He said that this program will make a significant contribution to China's post-war reconstruction and will enhance the traditional spirit of Sino-American cooperation.</p>
<h3>Beijing Campus of Railway Management School Occupied</h3>
<p>New President Xu Peikun Has Not Yet Arrived at the School</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Chongqing News] Since the Ministry of Education approved the independence of the Beijing Railway Management Institute, all faculty and students of the college have been excited. The college transfer promotion association, formed by all students of the college, is actively launching the transfer work. Although various alumni have worked hard to assist, there are still many difficulties. The failure to smoothly receive the college's campus in Beijing is the focus of the difficulty. During the period of enemy occupation, the campus was occupied by the enemy puppet regime. After the victory, it was occupied by the Beijing Repair Factory of the Tenth District Air Force Command of the Aviation Commission. Although the college sent personnel to Beijing to negotiate, there have been no results so far. According to the factory, the campus was taken over by the factory from the enemy puppet regime and was not occupied after the fact. The factory originally planned to be located in Nanyuan, but it cannot be moved to that location because it is leased by the US military. Once the US military withdraws, the factory will be able to vacate the campus. In addition, the new president, Mr. Xu Peikun, has not yet arrived at the school. The transfer work urgently needs Mr. Xu to preside over. All faculty and students of the college have urgently telegraphed Mr. Xu to ask him to come to the school as soon as possible. (Jin)</p>
<h3>First Batch of Tongji University Students Relocating to Shanghai Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The first batch of Tongji University students relocating to Shanghai to guard the school building are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, and the second batch will also depart, with a large number of 500 people, all taking the northwest route. The school has also announced the reward and punishment measures for relocating faculty and students. All students arriving in Shanghai must report to the Shanghai office, and those who guard the school building for more than two months will be given a minor merit and awarded a prize, otherwise, they will be given a major demerit. It is also learned that Sichuan students of the school will all go to Shanghai with the school. However, because the cost of living in Shanghai is too high, it is feared that most students will not be able to maintain their livelihood. Therefore, the Sichuan students decided to raise a scholarship and student aid fund for awards and assistance. Donation books have been sent out, and the target is set at 100 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Northwest Conservatory of Music Recently Closed</h3>
<p>Host Zhao Meibo Will Go to Beijing</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Xi'an News] The Shaanxi Private Northwest Conservatory of Music is hosted by the famous musician Professor Zhao Meibo. Most of the students come from the occupied areas. The school waives tuition and provides meals and accommodation. The school has been established for two and a half years, and it has made achievements in Northwest music education during the Anti-Japanese War. Because the school site is borrowed from Shaanxi Provincial No. 1 Middle School, after the restoration, No. 1 Middle School needs to be relocated, and the conservatory must be handed over. In addition, the problems of school equipment and teaching staff are very difficult. It is not easy to develop in the poor Northwest. After deliberation by the board of directors of the conservatory, it was decided to close it in February 1946. It is reported that Mr. Zhao will take his family to Beijing in May to raise funds to promote music education.</p>
<h3>Private Primary School Employees in Hangzhou Will Be Provided with Affordable Rice</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Hangzhou] Because the Ministry of Food has not approved the Zhejiang Province public education personnel's affordable rice, it is under discussion whether or not it will be allocated starting this month. The provincial food department is requesting instructions, while all employees of private primary schools in Hangzhou are repeatedly requesting that they be allocated in the same way as the municipal central primary school. Mayor Zhou and Director Wei are very sympathetic to this, so after detailed discussion, if the Ministry of Food and the provincial government approve the original plan and the food source is available, they will be allocated together.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Jinhua Agricultural School Allocates Funds to Rebuild the School</h3>
<p>Still Built on the Original Site in Tangya</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Hangzhou News] The provincial Jinhua Agricultural Vocational School was killed completely when Jinhua fell in 1942. Last month, the Ministry of Education sent former principal Bian Yimou to prepare for the reconstruction of the school. He first set up an office in the Jinhua Farm. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Education that 25 million yuan will be allocated from the funds allocated by the Ministry to subsidize vocational schools in the province, with 20 million yuan for construction costs and 5 million yuan for equipment costs. Key buildings will be built at the original school site in Tangya, 30 miles from the city, so that the school can be reopened as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Tangshan Institute of Technology Relocates: Limited Travel Expenses Require Students to Find Their Own Way Back to Tangshan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Bishan News] The relocation work of the Restoration Committee of Tangshan Institute of Technology has moved from the planning to the implementation stage. The directors of each group have been appointed separately. Travel expenses have also been allocated: 184,000 yuan per person for senior staff, 177,000 yuan per person for mid-level staff, 150,000 yuan per person for junior staff, and 105,000 yuan per student, plus a loan of 15,000 yuan for two months. The amount of travel expenses approved by the Ministry is only half of what is actually needed, so the college has ordered students to find their own way back to Tangshan. Some students who are facing financial difficulties or whose homes are in the liberated areas are shocked by this move by the college and have visited the president several times to ask the college to consider the situation of the students, but have not received a satisfactory response. Now the students have organized a student association to return to the north with the school and decided to work hard to convince the college and appeal to all relevant parties to ask the school to carry them back to the north. It is also reported that Tangshan College is scheduled to register for the next semester on September 23 and officially start classes on October 1. New students this year will be recruited in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai. The issue of public funding for the next academic year has become a matter of concern to students at various schools. According to the Chongqing Southwest Daily, the Ministry originally intended to cancel it, but it has been extended to the end of this year due to special reasons, but it has not yet been officially confirmed.

<h3>The First Group of Restored Personnel from the School of Pharmacy Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The School's Specialty Department Will Move to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] The first group of restored personnel from the National School of Pharmacy departed from Chongqing and arrived in Nanjing via highways through Guangyuan, Lingbao, Luoyang, and Xuzhou. A letter sent by ship from Nanjing reports on the journey, stating briefly: the trip from Chongqing to Guangyuan after disembarking from the military transport was not difficult; if there were passenger buses heading north, departure could be made on the same day. The most arduous part of the journey was the section in Shaanxi between Shanzhou and Lingbao; finding lodging was extremely difficult and prices were exorbitant. Car registration took four days to even have a chance, and the damage to the road surface and base of this section of highway was unparalleled in the entire country. Once past Luoyang, the journey became very smooth. As for travel expenses, each person spent about 150,000 yuan. If there was a group of around twenty people, 120,000 yuan would be sufficient. It is best to bring fewer children and luggage to avoid burden. It is also said that the original site of the school in Nanjing is still being used as an ammunition depot, and it is rumored that the Japanese middle school, which was approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, may be taken over by a certain important figure. Therefore, the school's specialty department will move entirely to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British Ancient Book Lent to the American Congress; House of Lords Opposes</h3>
<p>[Reuter's Dispatch from London, 9th] The British government's proposal to lend the Magna Carta to the Library of Congress in the United States for two years for public viewing was opposed by the House of Lords yesterday.

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Return of Staff and Students of National Middle Schools to Their Original Homes, Providing Key Instructions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing for this Newspaper] The Ministry of Education, in order to instruct the educational bureaus of various provinces and cities on handling the repatriation of staff and students of national middle schools to their original homes, recently issued a special order to the relevant bureaus stating: during the War of Resistance, the staff and students of national middle schools in the occupied areas experienced many dangers and hardships as they moved inland. Due to budget limitations, the inland provinces and cities were unable to establish schools to accommodate them. In order to provide relief to unemployed and out-of-school staff and students, and to meet the needs of the resistance areas, the Ministry established over fifty national middle schools one after another. These were originally temporary establishments. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, schools at all levels will return to normal, and there is no need to continue these temporary facilities. Last autumn, the Ministry convened a National Educational Post-War Restoration Conference. Regarding the restoration of national middle schools, a plan was drafted, discussed, and it was generally agreed that secondary education should still be maintained according to the principles to be managed by the provinces and cities. The Ministry, considering various practical situations, formulated a restoration plan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. Most of the national middle schools will be handed over to the original provinces and cities or the provinces and cities where they are located for management, based on their history and current situation. The faculty and students will either find employment or schooling in the provinces and cities where they are located or return to their original provinces and cities. In addition to ordering the schools to handle the repatriation of staff and students and all closing matters starting from May of this year in accordance with this principle, the key instructions regarding the restoration of national middle schools and related matters for the educational bureaus of various provinces and cities, and matters that need to be prepared now, are as follows:</p>
<p>Schools Established in Original Homes for Accommodation</p>
<p>(1) After the national middle schools are closed, staff and students whose registered residence is in the province or city where the original school is located will be accommodated by the provincial or municipal education bureaus where the original school is located. Those whose registered residence is in provinces or cities other than where the original school is located will be accommodated by the education bureaus of their respective original provinces or cities by establishing schools or classes. It is currently estimated that the "provinces" and "cities" should establish schools to accommodate a certain number of middle school students, a certain number of normal school students, and a certain number of vocational school students; a certain number of middle school faculty, a certain number of normal school faculty, and a certain number of vocational school faculty. The "bureaus" should immediately use existing public and private housing within the "province" and "city" or the school buildings left over from the original national middle schools to establish several provincial and municipal schools with six to eighteen grades, or add a certain number of classes to the existing "provincial" and "municipal" schools (referring to provinces and cities with very few staff and students). This should all be prepared for establishment during the summer vacation of this year to accommodate these returning staff and students. The person responsible for the establishment of the schools will be the former principal of the national middle school who is from the said "province" or "city." The recurrent expenses for establishing schools and classes, as well as the living subsidies and public funds for the staff and students who were originally in the national schools, are currently being discussed by the relevant departments of the Ministry and will be allocated to the "bureaus" for use at any time. Temporary expenses may also be allocated as needed.</p>
<p>Return to Original Home Starting in May</p>
<p>(2) The current principals and faculty members of the national middle schools will return to their original homes starting in May of this year. In addition to the Ministry sending a roster of names according to their registered residence to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities for notification, service certificates will be issued to the faculty and staff members from their original homes. The faculty and staff will report to the bureaus with these certificates, and the bureaus will assign them to newly established provincial and municipal schools. As for the middle school principals, they should be assigned to be principals of the newly established schools. If there are no newly established schools, or the number of newly established schools is not sufficient to accommodate these principals and faculty members, the bureaus should be responsible for assigning them other work, and their salaries and benefits can be paid from the allocated quota of the "city". During the War of Resistance, all staff worked hard and made many contributions. The bureaus must be mindful of this and arrange for their proper resettlement.</p>
<p>Resettlement of Homeless Students</p>
<p>(3) Students currently studying at the national middle schools will be issued transfer certificates by their respective schools after the end of the current semester. In addition, a student card will be made for each student and submitted to the Ministry for verification. It will then be distributed to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities according to the student's registered residence for safekeeping. The transfer certificates issued to students by the schools will be carried by the students themselves to their original homes and presented to the bureaus for verification and distribution to the newly established provincial and municipal schools for studies. If there are no newly established schools, or the number of newly established schools is not sufficient to accommodate them, they should be distributed to other schools for studies, and their student status will be verified based on the transfer certificates. Homeless students should be properly resettled by the authorities, and the bureau should designate personnel or establish a temporary organization to handle this matter. (4) The school buildings and equipment of the national middle schools, except for a portion of books and instruments originally brought out from other provinces and books purchased with ministry funds belonging to teacher's research, which may still be transported back to the original provinces and cities, should be transferred to the education bureaus where the schools are located. The transfer procedures and dates will be ordered separately.</p>
<p>Establish Return Reception Stations</p>
<p>(5) The bureaus should actively handle the following two items based on the instructions listed above: (a) Prepare school buildings and equipment for newly established schools and additional classes according to the number of returning staff and students, and report the types, numbers of schools, and additional classes to be established to the Ministry for verification within ten days of receiving the document. (b) At transportation hubs within the province and city, dispatch personnel to set up reception stations for returning staff and students, and prepare accommodation and transportation for when the staff and students arrive. In order to facilitate the handling of matters by the various provinces and cities, a list of the names, addresses, and principal names of the existing national middle schools, and the registered residence, is attached to the order. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance. (An)</p>
<h3>We Can Endure Hardship but Not Starvation</h3>
<p>Petition by Publicly Funded Students from Hangzhou Normal School and Others</p>
<p>Demanding Increased Subsistence Allowance from Education Department</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Hangzhou for this Newspaper] Although the food expenses for publicly funded students in Zhejiang provincial middle schools and normal and vocational students have been presented to the central government for adjustment to 5,000 yuan per person, the number approved by the central government differs greatly from the actual number. After unified allocation, the amount received by each person is not much. The education department has telegraphed the central government to request that it be approved according to the standard of food expenses for students of the Normal College of Zhejiang University, and to be considered according to the actual number. It is learned that the provincial government has received a telegram from the central government, approving an increase to 8,000 yuan per person per month starting from April, but it will still be allocated according to the number approved by the central government. Publicly funded students from five schools, including Hangzhou Normal School and Medical College, believe that the amount increased by the central government still fails to meet the original request of one-quarter of the subsidy for provincial civil servants. Therefore, it was decided to gather at Hangzhou Normal School at 9:00 a.m. on the 8th and go to the Education Department to petition Director Xu, and to appeal to all sectors for assistance. When the reporter filed this dispatch, the students were marching in formation. A copy of the slogans obtained is recorded below: Slogans: (1) Education First, (2) Even at the highest calculation, it's only 4,000 yuan, which is not enough to keep us alive, (3) Our wish is only for a meal, (4) We can endure hardship, but not starvation, (5) The government must not forget normal schools, which are concentration camps for poor students, (6) We cannot stop studying for a day, and we cannot go without food for a day even more so, (7) We have reasonable demands, and the government should have reasonable solutions.

<h3>Sino-British Cultural Relations: Mr. Pu Leidao of Britain Gives a Speech in London Encouraging the British People to Study Chinese</h3>
<p>[British News Agency Dispatch from London, 8th] Mr. Pu Leidao, former cultural affairs official at the British Embassy in China, recently gave a speech on "Sino-British Cultural Relations" at the China Association in London. He emphasized that Britain should encourage British students to study the Chinese language, Chinese art, music, literature, and philosophy to promote understanding of China. Mr. Pu's speech was divided into three parts, describing how the lifestyles of the Chinese and British people mutually influence each other. He stated that it is increasingly necessary for China and Britain to strengthen their relationship, but this can only succeed if they understand each other's backgrounds. There is a natural affinity between the people of China and Britain. The established medical system demonstrates mutual respect. Both sides have confidence in each other's character and both have a sense of humor. Unfortunately, there is still too little contact between the two peoples. One of the reasons is that the two countries are too far apart, and there are very few British people who can speak Chinese, let alone read Chinese newspapers, essays, or ordinary letters. On the other hand, Chinese art, literature, and philosophy are rarely studied by the British. However, the British spirit of public service is worthy of emulation by the Chinese. The future of mankind depends on the establishment of trust between nations. Strengthening Sino-British relations is the realization of Confucius' saying, "All men within the four seas are brothers."</p>

<h3>Former President of Shanghai University, Fan Zhengkang, Goes to the United States to Study Education</h3>
<p>Embarked by Plane Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This City] Shanghai University, established by the American Baptist Church, has enjoyed an outstanding reputation for 40 years. Since 1926, in accordance with Chinese education laws, the school appointed a Chinese person, Liu Zhan'en, to be President and Fan Zhengkang to be Dean. For more than ten years, every aspect of the school, including the expansion of school buildings, the revision of the curriculum, and the training of students' minds, has been meticulously planned and carefully managed, resulting in the school's present scale. During the War of Resistance against Japan, Shanghai fell into enemy hands. President Liu remained loyal and led anti-Japanese work. Unfortunately, he died for the country on April 7, 1939. The school's board of directors appointed Fan Zhengkang as president, and he maintained school affairs under extremely difficult and harsh conditions. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the school was forced to close voluntarily. Fan resided in Shanghai, living in seclusion. He repeatedly tried to go to Chongqing, but was prevented by circumstances. After the victory of the War of Resistance last year, President Fan resumed school on September 1 and presided over school affairs, planning to repair the original site on Yangshupu Road. On February 15 of this year, he resigned from the board of directors to make way for more capable people. However, the board of directors, recognizing Fan's service to Shanghai University for nineteen years, with outstanding contributions, specially sent Fan to travel and study education in the United States for one year. At the same time, various American church organizations sent telegrams inviting Fan to attend meetings. As the meeting dates are approaching, he embarked on a flight to the United States yesterday morning.</p>

<h3>American Journalism Education, United States Information Service</h3>
<p>The American Press Institute, to be established at Columbia University in New York this September, will open a new chapter in the history of journalism education in the United States. It is administratively part of Columbia University, but is otherwise independent. The institute is divided into two parts: journalism skills and journalism background. The director is Flord Taylor, editorial writer for the New York Herald Tribune and professor of journalism at Columbia. During its planning stages, it has already received donations from twenty-seven newspapers and magazines, "Editor &amp; Publisher," and many journalism organizations. Unlike traditional academic journalism schools, it does not give credits and has no exams. It admits 150 students each year, hoping that journalists from all over the country will come here for research work. It requires all newspapers to support this graduate school. The American Press Institute pays special attention to training journalists. Its courses include topics such as US-Soviet relations, inflation, city taxes, and labor issues.</p>
<p>In 1941, there were 542 four-year universities in the United States with journalism departments. Columbia University, the University of Missouri, and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, are nationally recognized as leaders in the field of journalism. In addition, many state and private universities have active journalism schools and departments.</p>
<p>According to a report published in the December 1945 issue of the Journalism Quarterly by the American Association of Schools and Departments of Journalism, 34 member schools had a total of 10,000 graduates in 1942. These people are all active members of the American journalism community.</p>
<p>The speculative tabloids of the early 19th century conflicted with the social aspirations of the American people, and this conflict led to the specialized training of journalists. Robert E. Lee, a famous Confederate general during the Civil War, first established a journalism course at a university. At that time, he was the president of Washington University in Lexington, Virginia (now called Washington and Lee University). In 1869, he asked the school's board of directors to establish fifty scholarships for young people who were willing to devote their lives to publishing or journalism.</p>
<p>Many editors opposed journalism education, believing that true journalism education could only be obtained through practical experience at newspapers. However, despite their opposition, journalism courses were quickly and widely established in various schools. Due to its social purpose and the ambition of thousands of young people, journalism education was included in American higher education.</p>
<p>In 1903, Joseph Pulitzer, a man with a strong social conscience and editorial experience, gave Columbia University two million dollars to establish a journalism school. Columbia's Pulitzer School of Journalism remains one of the best schools. The main courses include newspaper management, newspaper publishing, journalism law, journalism ethics, journalism history, and newspaper literature. The school was founded in 1912, and in 1935, Director Carl W. Ackerman made it a formal school, requiring a university degree for admission and awarding a master's degree upon graduation.</p>
<p>Since 1902, specialized research in journalism has yielded good results. The Journalism Quarterly has listed 10,000 master's and doctoral thesis topics, including advertising, biography, foreign journalism, journalism history, newspaper law, news gathering and writing, distribution and promotion, radio news, and reader interest. The following examples can show the types and scope of recent topics.</p>
<p>"The Automatic Control of the Advertising Industry"</p>
<p>University of Chicago, 1943.</p>
<p>"The Basis and Implementation of the American Wartime Censorship System," University of Wisconsin, 1945.</p>
<p>"The Influence of Chicago Newspapers on the 1936 Presidential Election," Northwestern University, 1938.</p>
<p>"An Analysis of News Related to the Far East in California Newspapers from 1934-38," Stanford University, 1940.</p>
<p>Today, American journalism education has developed to meet social needs. It will surely continue to develop in the future.</p>

<h3>Major Players Exit, Government Bonds Fall; Chinese Stocks Weaken; Foreign Stocks Also Down Slightly by About 10%</h3>
<p>Although bond operators tried their best to promote activity, it was ultimately an illusion. Seeing profits, many exited the market. Tongs (統丙) initially started around 7,450 yuan in the morning, but continuous selling by major players suppressed the price. Seeing the situation was not good, retail investors followed suit and closed out their positions. The market price broke through the 7,000 yuan level, retreating to 6,600 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, the price fell by a small 400 yuan compared to the previous closing. Jia (甲), Yi (乙), and Ding (丁) bonds each fell by 100 yuan, and Wu (戊) bonds fell by 250 yuan. Group stocks were still being pushed up, but the momentum was unsustainable. Considering the future, operators and the Northern Clique had no choice but to bet on Yongsha, making it difficult to support other stocks. Mei Ya gradually lost its luster, and there were rumors that Jingfu would be abandoned by major players, with talk that they would be pushed out of the market starting today. Yesterday, a large number of Jingfu shares flowed out, causing some concern. Yesterday's market was the most sluggish, affecting other small stocks. At the opening, carrying the momentum from the previous night, Yongsha reached a high of 5,650 yuan, Mei Ya 4,830 yuan, Jingfu 4,700 yuan, Xin Guang 3,800 yuan, and Dong Xing 3,250 yuan. Afterwards, the situation gradually became unfavorable. Near noon, all hot stocks saw lower prices. Compared to the previous closing, Yongsha rose slightly, Mei Ya fell slightly, and Jingfu and the other three small hot stocks each fell by about 5%. The remaining stocks, in order of coolness, saw slight increases for the cooler ones, while the hotter ones all fell slightly. In the afternoon, bidding was slightly weaker, but many in the industry stopped doing day-to-day futures, preventing transactions from developing. Foreign stocks were relatively stable at the start. Yisha was bid up to 16,000 yuan, but was suppressed by sellers and found it difficult to sell. It ended the day down 10%. Other stocks were also affected slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the popular Yisha and Yinglian fell by slightly less than 5%, and other stocks were affected slightly.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the ingot market remained calm, resulting in no one applying to the Central Bank for allocated goods. It opened in the morning around 1.61 million, with few transactions. After 10:00 AM, it was around 1.6 million, making it unnecessary to register for allocation. More people were releasing gold for interest. At noon, it hovered around 1.585 million. The afternoon was even quieter, staying below the 1.6 million allocation price. As a result, it closed down 10,000 compared to the previous closing. Ornamental gold was 171,000, sycee silver was 1,700, silver dollars were also flat, and qingchai (晴拆) was slightly flat. Interest rates ranged from 18 to 21 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies, especially U.S. dollars, remained stable. Various types of floating capital continued to be absorbed, but due to a lack of stimulation, the speculative atmosphere was extremely weak. Holders also released some, resulting in a balance of supply and demand. The process was smooth. It started in the morning around 2,210 yuan. The gold market was slightly weaker, gradually declining from 2,220 yuan to within 2,200 yuan. In the afternoon, it hovered around 2,200 yuan. As a result, it closed down 15 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were flat to weak, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 425 yuan, and the rupee around 525 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate also remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Mixed; Spot Cotton Transactions Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, yarn prices were mixed. Large-scale yarn still lacked vitality. Due to the sluggish yarn prices in Guangzhou, the Cantonese Clique took no action. 20-count Double Horse once fell to 1.15 million, but ultimately recovered to 1.21 million at closing due to the strong thread prices. 42-count Double Strand saw a large amount of buying by the Tianjin Clique, and the price gradually rose from 1.71 million to 1.82 million, an increase of 110,000 compared to the previous day. At noon, the Textile Construction (紡建) company opened sales as usual. The price of 42-count yarn was 40,000 yuan higher than the previous period. 10-count unbranded tea-colored Double Strand thread was uniquely high at 170,000 yuan more. The rest were similar. In addition, there were ten types of yarn money offered for tender. Only four types, totaling 38 pieces, were bid for by F茂, 同泰昌, 賫豐 and other factories. The price per piece was as follows: 11 pieces of cow hair bobbin yarn (10 army packs) (415,000 yuan), 7 pieces of 10-count Xianhe (740,000 yuan), 10 pieces of 20-count Xianhe grass bag yarn (1,000,000 yuan), and 3 pieces of 10-count Sailing Boat (700,000 yuan). Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraphic report rose by 7 to 22 points. The estimated near-term price was $27.50, the forward price was $27.77, and the Mitterling spot price was $28.11. Spot cotton transactions in the local market were stable. Private factories such as Tongyi and Jia 　 also made purchases. The market situation was stable.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Strong</h3>
<p>There is considerable demand for tribute green tea from Mumbai, India, but transactions are still stalled due to transportation issues. Local traders are proactively accumulating stock in preparation for export when the opportunity arises. Therefore, inquiries were brisk yesterday, but sellers immediately became more bullish upon receiving inquiries. Although there were negotiations between buyers and sellers in the market yesterday, they ultimately failed to reach an agreement due to the significant price difference. Other varieties are still well-received in Tianjin, Suzhou, and other places. At the same time, demand from local stores is also strong, further strengthening prices.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The rice market was flat yesterday. Japonica and Indica rice prices remained unchanged. However, early indica rice, which is dehumidifying and fragrant, increased slightly by 400-500 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, continuing to fall by 400-500 yuan. The oil market saw inquiries from the Cantonese Clique, but supply was limited, remaining flat to weak. Soybean cake sales were sparse, and bran also saw little activity. There was a unique abundance of soybeans from Pinghu, which fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Other soybeans saw little activity. Raw peanuts returned a small 1,000-2,000 yuan. Mung beans and corn saw no change. According to market reports, the total amount of rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday included six types, totaling over 3,000 shi (石). The types and amounts are as follows: Japonica rice 1,649 shi, Du Indica 340 shi, Sheep Indica 40 shi, early rice 513 shi, thin rice 421 shi, 100 yuan 110 shi.</p>

<h3>Vegetable Oil Allocation Date Specified</h3>
<p>The China Vegetable Oil Factory has specified the allocation dates for raw vegetable oil to retail stores in the city. Group A will pick up goods on Mondays and Thursdays, Group B on Tuesdays and Fridays, and Group C on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Each group consists of 200 households, with each household receiving one barrel of raw vegetable oil.

<h3>Silk Market Quiet; Silk Prices Already Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, for artificial silk, 120 Bridge brand opened relatively stable in the morning at 1.4 million yuan and closed at 1.39 million yuan. In the afternoon, it became softer, trading at 1.35 million yuan. 120 miscellaneous brands were priced the same as the previous day. The price of the remaining brands was determined by whether there was a transaction, with minor fluctuations. Transactions for factory-made silks were also quiet. The asking price for silk used by customers was similar to the previous day. Yesterday, the trading of silk fabrics was quite active, and prices also rose slightly. Meiya bed covers rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan. The highest price offered for Dacheng Ge Shizhu (十 縐) was 3,734 yuan, and the result was 3,700 yuan. According to tax rates, the tax payable is 1,323.10 yuan. As for the income of employees in various industries, those whose income does not exceed the highest tax-free amount will still be taxed according to the previously established calculation formula, so that the spirit of alleviating the people's difficulties can be implemented, and the effect of increasing tax revenue can be achieved. The attached calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Let A represent the employee's monthly income.</p>
<p>B represent the highest tax-free amount for civil servants per month (that is, the sum of the basic salary and increments of the highest-paid civil servants).</p>
<p>C represent the taxable income (taxed according to the tax rate).</p>
<p>Then A-B=C</p>
<h3>Platinum Price Increase</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] According to London metal industry sources, the price of platinum in the United States rose to $56 per ounce (pure) on Monday, but there is no news from New York. It is implied that the price of platinum in the UK will rise from £11 10s to £14 per ounce.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 8th] The New York metal market opened with a platinum price of $53 to $56 per ounce (pure).</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Remain Soft</h3>
<p>Due to sluggish sales and tight money, the coal market remained soft, despite the best efforts of major players who were limited by short positions. According to general observations, major players are waiting to see this month's factory figures. Customers are scarce, and the market is deserted. Coal merchants from the north say that the current market price of white coal in Shanghai is still weakening. Recently, those who have transported coal from the north are not experts in the coal industry, so when the cargo ships reach the Shanghai docks, there are no suitable warehouses or unloading procedures. They want to sell quickly, entrusting one or two familiar traders to sell, but the traders are unable to sell due to sluggish sales, so they can only cut prices. However, the production price in the north has risen, and transportation costs are also high. If this continues, it may affect subsequent shipments.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Situation in Stalemate; General Manager's Remarks Cause Indignation; Ding Fangyuan Expresses Unwillingness to Continue; Strike Continues Yesterday</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth industry in the city is dissatisfied because the Textile Construction group has set up sales offices, limited to Baoda Xiang and other three companies, and identified the remaining yarn and cloth from the pseudo-commercial unified association as government materials, publicly offering them for sale, which has caused dissatisfaction among all industry players. When Textile Construction opened for business the other day, there was a dispute on the spot, and they went on strike together, blaming the board of directors of the industry association. While the association was trying to resolve the situation, it suddenly saw the remarks of Mr. Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of Textile Construction, in the evening newspaper, which he considered to be controlled by a few brokers, and stated that he would not change the plan for sales offices, which made the public even more angry and unable to calm down. Yesterday afternoon, they gathered at the Cotton Cloth Association to discuss countermeasures. The board of directors repeatedly tried to persuade them, but the public was still difficult to appease. It is reported that representatives will be elected today to ask Mr. Shu about the truth in person, and it is scheduled to be held at the Atlantic Vegetable Society on Fuzhou Road at 2:30 PM on the 9th to explain everything to the press. The market and Paradise market of its association are still on strike, and it is reported that the three associations of the yarn industry, dyeing and weaving industry, and cotton cloth industry sent a letter directly to General Manager Shu last night, excerpts as follows</p>
<p>Three Associations Express</p>
<p>We recently heard that the Huamei Evening News (May 8) published a talk by your General Manager on the shutdown of the cotton cloth market, which is purely a obliteration of the facts and is close to insult. The yarn and cloth industry is indignant and demands that this association, etc., ask your General Manager to explain the basis of the talk. It has been found that your company did not accommodate the opinions of most of the industry players before setting up the sales office this time. Moreover, at this time, the remaining yarn and cloth from the pseudo-commercial unified association, which is still in dispute, were identified as government materials and publicly offered for sale, which caused criticism from the industry players, who blamed the board of directors of the association. The Cotton Cloth Association is trying to resolve the situation and wants to obtain reasonable treatment to benefit the future of official-business cooperation. Unexpectedly, your General Manager had this talk, which made our association unable to help and was very painful. After all, should you show clearly whether the talk in the newspaper was issued by your General Manager personally so that it can be forwarded to the industry players.</p>
<p>Textile Construction's Expression</p>
<p>Since the Textile Construction Company took over the factories and actively increased production, the output of yarn and cloth has increased day by day, and the yarn and cloth received also urgently need to be sold. At the same time, the inland transportation has gradually improved and transportation has become easier. The company has established branches and offices in major domestic markets to supply various places and to stabilize prices, and has carried out its own transportation and sales. In Shanghai, the company's business office has a very narrow area, although the yarn and cloth are listed every other day, but it is extremely crowded every day. In addition, the company's sales of cloth are wholesale in nature, and retail purchases are quite inconvenient. In order to change the supply and facilitate the cloth merchants, the company has selected three cloth shops in Shanghai, such as Baoda Xiang, which have the largest cloth business, to set up sales offices. The selling price is in accordance with the company's listing, and the company sends personnel to supervise and pay a large amount of deposit. However, all business affairs and expenses of the sales office, such as transportation, warehousing, insurance, and staff salaries, are borne by the sales office, so a commission of 0.25% of the sales amount is given. This method is purely for promoting the sale of cloth and facilitating the cloth merchants. The company's business office still lists and sells as before. In fact, it is to increase a sales location, which is not unfavorable to the cloth merchants.</p>
<p>Concession of Sales Office</p>
<p>Ding Fangyuan, who is responsible for the sales office, has reportedly expressed his unwillingness to continue, while Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of China Textile Company, said that the purpose of China Textile's entrustment of distributors is to promote transactions. The entrusted party must have at least four conditions: (1) strong ability to sell cloth, (2) reliable credit, (3) suitable location, and (4) strong financial resources. As for the expansion of the distribution system, it is also under consideration. The sales office has a contractual relationship with the company, and both parties have an obligation to comply. However, if one party cannot continue, the company will not force it.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates; Salary Income Tax Deduction and Exemption; May Not Exceed the Tax-Free Standard of the Highest-Paid Civil Servants</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently received an order from the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, stating that although the calculation standards for the salary and remuneration income tax of employees in various industries in the city have been formulated and announced in accordance with the new taxation methods for civil servants, the salary income of employees in various industries has increased repeatedly in recent months, and the monthly income is several times higher than the highest salary of civil servants. If all taxes are levied according to the previously established tax rate, the tax-free amount enjoyed would be too high, which would lose the meaning of fairness and would not conform to the original intention of the progressive tax system. In order to remedy this shortcoming, a supplementary method is added from April, that is, the tax-free amount of the highest-paid civil servant with a salary of 800 yuan per month is used as the highest tax-free amount. If the monthly salary of employees in various industries exceeds the salary of the highest-paid civil servant, the excess part, whether in the name of subsidies or living allowances, should be regarded as taxable income for calculating taxation. For example, the basic number of living allowances is 40,000 yuan, and the salary increment is 130 times. Calculated on the basis of the base salary of 800 yuan for the highest-paid civil servant, the monthly income is 144,000 yuan. This number is the highest tax-free amount. If an employee has a monthly salary of 150,000 yuan, the remaining 6,000 yuan after deducting the highest salary of civil servants is the taxable</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Firm and Sluggish</h3>
<p>The selling price of woolen fabrics is still firm. The amount of goods arriving is not much, and there is a lack of officially jointly sold Wangjia goods. The market price is caused by various factors, and the sale price is not very cheap. At the same time, the production quantity of the local factory's goods has decreased or not increased. Even from the proof of the facts, the cost is more than the market price. Looking at the goods opened and allocated by China Textile, the opening price is not cheap, and most of them are untimely and rough wool and silk quality lower-grade goods, so most of the goods holders are unwilling to cut prices too much. In terms of sales, first, everyone wants to wait for the goods to arrive and expect a price drop, and everyone delays adding needs. Second, it is due to the time of the year when new and old crops meet. Third, they are subject to each other's waiting and watching. Each gang and number hold the principle of replenishing as they sell, and steadying themselves, and there are absolutely no pre-purchases and stockpiling. Therefore, a situation of firm prices and sluggish sales is created.</p>
<h3>Sugar Trends Continue to Weaken; Branches and Dried Longan Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken. The association's disk opened with 58,000 yuan to 57,750 yuan for sand white, down another 1,000 yuan. Car white honey was 62,000 yuan, and local snow white was 62,000 yuan. The opening price of No. 貨 was particularly high, with Diao Qing at 52,000 yuan, ordinary at 48,000 yuan, and sub-zhuang at over 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of arrivals and inventory of dried lychees, the market situation has tightened again. Yesterday, a batch was opened by Nan City merchants, with a price of 190,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous one. Shangzhuang miscellaneous road large style dried longan was 86,000 yuan, up more than 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Sheep Liver Lacquer Arrives; Copperware and Green Gauze are Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Sheep liver lacquer has arrived from India. The first batch of 500 boxes has been unloaded from the shore yesterday. The market price is still difficult to fall because the cost, tax, and shipping costs are all high, and sales are still low. As for domestic copperware products, such as copper locks and drawer locks, the raw materials are increasing in price, and the labor is also expensive. In terms of customer sales, the Tianjin gang has a slight appetite, and the market price is firm, but it is still far from the bottom cost. Due to the lack of actual sales, the market price of yuan nails is weakening. Green gauze has a rising trend due to seasonal reasons.</p>
<h3>American Gold Mine Owners Negotiate; Request Free Export</h3>
<p>[Reuters, San Francisco, 8th] Twenty gold mine operators from South Dakota, Colorado, Washington, and California recently held informal talks here, intending to formulate a plan to contribute to the U.S. Treasury Department, allowing newly mined gold to be shipped to various overseas locations, so that U.S. gold miners can benefit from the free world market price. Secretary Nop of the American Mining Federation pointed out that the price of gold is currently rising in countries such as Egypt, Turkey, Chile, and Brazil, with prices between US$43 and US$120 per ounce, but the US Treasury Department only limits the price to US$35 per ounce, and restricts U.S. gold miners from being able to sell to the Treasury Department. Nop continued, "In 1944, the U.S. exported gold, mainly for the production of artistic gold, with a value of US$85 million."</p>
<h3>10,000 Bales of American Cotton Arrive in Shanghai; Hai Zhe Ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Transports Large Quantities of Rayon and Tobacco from Qingdao</h3>
<p>The New Orleans Victory, managed by the Warren Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the United States, carrying more than 10,160 bales of cotton. It is currently docked at the floating dock in front of the Jiangnan Shipyard for unloading. Today, the Zhao Shangju's Zhixin ship is sailing to Tianjin, carrying more than 1,600 bales of cotton, which is declared and loaded by the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Rayon and Tobacco Arrive in Shanghai. The Hai Zhe ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Qingdao, carrying 1,060 boxes of rayon, which are goods from the Central Trust Bureau, and 2,350 pieces of tobacco.</p>

<h3>Going To and From Hanoi—Filled with Things Seen in the Eyes, Buried in the Heart</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Airmail Report, May 2nd</p>
<p>Leaving Nanning, heading to northern Vietnam, it's the season when mountain flowers bloom and singing birds stir the soul. Brushing away the dust of travel, carefully savoring the magnificent scenery of this Indochinese peninsula, and adding to it many things seen in the eyes but buried in the heart, there are truly endless feelings.</p>
<p>Today's Vietnam. What is brewing is not the groan of sorrow and despair, but a prairie fire about to rage. Small nations are not born to be slaves. The children of ancient Jiaozhi are stubbornly breaking their shackles today, solemnly declaring, "They want independence! They want freedom!"</p>
<p>Leaving Yongzhou, passing Pingxiang. The car sped past the majestic Zhongnan Pass. Like a coiling dragon and crouching tiger, it stands alone on the border. Imagining the heroic spirit of the Black Flag heroes in 1885, cutting down generals and planting flags, directly attacking the French fortress, looking up at the floating clouds and silently gazing at the green mountains, it truly enhances the love for the motherland.</p>
<p>Leaving the majestic pass, ahead lies Vietnamese territory. The exquisite asphalt road reveals the painstaking efforts of the rulers. The emerald green trees on both sides, the bullets silently flashed through from inside. The green tiles and red walls of Dong Dang, a city of gods, after all, only has ten hearts beating. The fields by the road were already withered and cracked, unrecognizable. Weeds greeted people, the scorching sun hung high in the sky, and the Vietnamese people in tattered clothes lowered their heads, carrying burdens and pushing carts. Shabby thatched huts are everywhere in the valleys. Only the market in Dong Dang appears so quiet, so French. But French people, I haven't seen a single one. Asking the expatriates on the street, they smiled slightly and said: "The French are afraid of guerrillas, they ran away long ago." This is the first time I saw a microcosm of struggle.</p>
<p>The situation in Lang Son is roughly the same. Only the heroic posture of the National Army, carrying submachine guns and standing guard, can stir up the calm waves of the heart. The former gun emplacements, which once glared menacingly towards the border, have now been dismantled by our army. Looking at the debris of those reinforced concrete structures, there is a feeling of indescribable pleasure in my heart.</p>
<p>National Flags of Four Countries Hang High in the Propaganda Hall</p>
<p>Leaving Lang Son and continuing on, you arrive at Bac Giang. It used to be a major railway station, but now it's a scene of dilapidated walls and ruins, a gloomy scene. The railway has long been dismantled. (When we took over, we didn't take advantage of the railway equipment. Even if there were, the rails in Annam were smaller than the existing ones in our country. It is said that this is the most precise calculation of the French, for the purpose of making it impossible for the trains of China and Vietnam to ever be connected.) What is most noteworthy is that there is a propaganda hall of the Vietnamese provisional government on the road. In a small hall, the national flags of China, Vietnam, the United States, and the Soviet Union hang high (the form of the Vietnamese national flag was only recently determined, a red background with a large yellow star in the middle, which is very interesting). The table is filled with Vietnamese books, newspapers, and magazines. The four walls are full of thought-provoking cartoons, sarcastic and inflammatory, which the Vietnamese drew for their "rulers." It must make them burst with anger.</p>
<p>Arriving in Hanoi, running around in the east, listening around in the west, I heard a lot of awkward stories. Naturally, there are many exciting things, but the excitement always carries a bit of numbness. What interests us about Vietnam is not the Vietnamese girls' slender waists, swaying in the wind, nor the row of ink-like teeth, but our own big and small matters, the big and small battles fought by the Vietnamese people, and the tears of the overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>Wearing Straw Sandals into Vietnam, Returning with Full Pockets</p>
<p>After "August 15th," the National Army entered Vietnam to accept the surrender in September. The grandeur of the scene at that time is truly hard to describe. The overseas Chinese in Hanoi erected colorful arches, desperately taking out money. The National Army soldiers who first stepped into Hanoi, whether they were company commanders, platoon leaders, or even the lowest-ranking orderlies, were all invited to stay in the most exquisite hotels. Wealthy merchants voluntarily offered their houses as barracks. Female students washed the feet of wounded soldiers. Banquets every night, revelry every day, no overseas Chinese were not happy to the point of bursting. Amidst the universal joy, the Vietnamese version of achieving five promotions at once and the prosperity of the three oceans quickly came into effect. The overseas Chinese, who had seen too many novel things, went up another level and saw even more inexplicable things. First, cars were snatched, houses were snatched, and it's a little embarrassing to say, even flushing toilets were stuffed into cars. Naturally, it will be said again that these comings and goings are the work of a "small number" of unscrupulous elements. It is these unscrupulous elements who wear straw sandals into Vietnam. When they come out, they have a pile of banknotes in their pockets, a woman on the left, a Annamese bicycle on the right, a watch on their hand, and a string of rings. This is just for the unscrupulous lower-level cadres; the higher-ups know it without saying it.</p>
<p>National Currency Takes One Step Back, Gold Plummet Ten Feet</p>
<p>What made the overseas Chinese bankrupt was not the issue of small gains, but the issue of the value of the currency, which took away their lives. When the National Army first arrived, the overseas Chinese heard that French banknotes were not used, and all transactions were in Customs Gold Units. Added to this was their overheated hearts, believing that from now on, they would naturally trust us in everything. So, they desperately threw out French banknotes to buy Customs Gold Units, our own paper money. How hot it was! One hundred Customs Gold Units could be exchanged for 150 French banknotes, and they were willing to exchange for 200 yuan. The shops marked that they were based on Customs Gold Units, and the bookstores marked that they were valued in Customs Gold Units. The craze for Customs Gold Units, with French banknotes beaten down to the eighteenth hell, came entirely from a pure and sincere heart, without any economic theory. Unfortunately, how long did it take for the National Army to take a step back, and the Customs Gold Units plummeted ten feet. Today, 100 Customs Gold Units cannot be exchanged for 30 French banknotes. The merchants who threw out French banknotes went bankrupt, suicides, escapes, and imprisonments can be heard everywhere. A sweet dream, vanished like smoke, the golden age of Customs Gold Units is over, and the excitement of the overseas Chinese has also disappeared. A major bankruptcy, it is still our own people who suffer. Not only that, but the overseas Chinese will have an even greater suffering.</p>
<p>Signing the Sino-French Agreement, Endless Suffering</p>
<p>First of all, the reporter must write a little "prelude" to understand the truth of the matter. The National Army's area of surrender only extended to 16 degrees north latitude. The overseas Chinese living in Saigon and its suburbs were not in the surrender area. The overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong were still able to laugh and be happy. Regardless of whether tears followed the laughter, the overseas Chinese in the Saigon area (more broadly, the Cochinchina area) washed their faces with tears all day long. After the Sino-French agreement was signed, the "Chinese tax papers" in Saigon followed suit and were doubled in price. Before, only five fingerprints were needed, but now ten must be affixed. Rape, arson, and murder were not much "friendlier" than when the Japanese occupied it. It can be said to be revenge, and it can also be said that it's "what they deserve." Who told them they were not progressing? If someone wants to punch you, they punch you. Now, this punch has come to Hanoi.</p>
<p>Ginger and Chili Soup Follow the Storm</p>
<p>After the "Haiphong Incident," a storm passed (this "landing" was not simple, and it can be said to be extremely barbaric. Our warehouses were damaged, and we unceremoniously sank one of their gunboats. Who told them to use force to solve this unproblematic problem? The French troops remaining in the mainland also destroyed the highway we used to transport troops back home. Everyone understands the intention of this axe). In mid-March, the French troops finally entered Hanoi without much difficulty. The French citizens welcomed them, just like our overseas Chinese welcomed the National Army. After the welcome, the Vietnamese and our overseas Chinese also had the honor of enjoying a lot of ginger and chili soup. The heroes who sang "I would rather die than not have freedom" were truly free to an extreme. Rape, robbery, eating and drinking wantonly, leaving without paying a penny, they were truly imposing. Fortunately, the National Army in Hanoi had not completely withdrawn. After all, it's better to have your own people. Otherwise, the overseas Chinese in Hanoi would really not know "where to end up." Maintaining good relations between nations is one thing, but recognizing the facts is another. If we cannot respect and love each other, why must we use perfume to cover up the blood?</p>
<p>Nguyen Hai Than Leads the Vietnamese Nationalist Party</p>
<p>On the one hand, the French side wants our National Army to withdraw as soon as possible. On the other hand, they ask the National Army to delay the withdrawal "because the security has not been stabilized." The contradiction within the contradiction has long told us what this is all about. We naturally have a sense of proportion and will not be fools. Now, let's take a look at the climax of the Vietnamese people's struggle for freedom!</p>
<p>The three major political parties in Vietnam are: the Vietnam Independence League, the Nationalist Party, and the Revolutionary League. Among them, the Nationalist Party has the longest history. The leader is Nguyen Hai Than, an old man in his seventies, who has been engaged in revolution for more than fifty years and understands China the most. Unfortunately, there is a lack of cadres and weak military strength (there is a soldier stationed on Hang Gai Street, the entire army has 700 people), so they cannot achieve greater achievements. Although he once participated in the "coalition government" controlled by Ho Chi Minh a month ago, he withdrew as a result of dissatisfaction with Ho's actions, and there was even a gun battle. Now he has secretly entered Guangxi from Vietnam.</p>
<p>"Kill the Chinese First, Then Resist France"</p>
<p>The head of the Vietnam Independence League is Ho Chi Minh, who is entirely composed of communists. In his forties, he is a thin man who has "studied" in the Soviet Union. Most of the cadres came from Yan'an and are another branch of the Chinese Communist Party. They organized a "coalition government" in Hanoi, and the Bao Dai Emperor was forced to abdicate by him. He also speaks of "democracy," but he does have considerable military force, so he can speak to some extent when mediating between France and Vietnam. However, his actions are not necessarily welcomed by the Vietnamese people. On the one hand, he says, "China and Vietnam are one family." On the other hand, he shouts, "Kill all the Chinese first, and then resist the French devils." It is their double-dealing trick. Many people have suffered because of this, but they have not been seen resisting France. The first truly independent actions can only be seen when the coalition government has not yet had internal strife and when the Vietnamese people's hatred of France is at its peak. The first time was in early March, because the French side did not fulfill the Franco-Vietnamese agreement and desperately increased troops in Cochinchina, which aroused the Vietnamese people's accumulated anger. They held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration in Hanoi. Less than five days after the demonstration, a thousand French troops attempted to open Hanoi from Haiphong [to suppress it]. As a result, the Vietnamese people were furious and voluntarily prepared to fight. Swords were drawn and bows were stretched, and war was imminent. Fortunately, the National Army dispatched troops to mediate and used force to persuade the French troops to return to their defenses, and the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>Rumor That the Provisional Government Will Implement Reorganization</p>
<p>One wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. In late March, these heroes, who regarded themselves as colonial rulers, suddenly sent troops to occupy the Ministry of Finance and the Arsenal in Hanoi. As a result, the entire city went on strike, workers went on strike, and students went on strike, demanding that the French troops withdraw immediately. Gunshots rang out at night, and the supply of food and water to the French citizens was completely cut off. In desperation, they withdrew from the Ministry of Finance. As for the Cochinchina area, there were also reports of Vietnamese people carrying bombs, swimming to the side of French warships, and blowing up warships, and their bodies were soaked in gasoline to explode the gunpowder depot. These reports do not talk about stirring up emotions. The real emotions are in the hearts of the Vietnamese people. Let us open our eyes and see. To be honest, after the Sino-French agreement on Vietnam was signed, the overseas Chinese began to suffer even greater hardships: the French bully them, and the Vietnamese hate them. Recently, there have been news of the reorganization of the Vietnamese provisional government. Only bystanders can understand the many unclear relationships.</p>
<p>Prepare to Eliminate Illiteracy Within One Year</p>
<p>The Vietnamese people's desire to improve is absolutely not to be underestimated. In terms of culture alone, the Vietnamese newspapers and magazines in Hanoi are truly enough. There are more than a dozen newspapers, such as the [Nationalist Party] National Salvation [Independence League], the League [Revolutionary League], etc., and ten magazines, such as Vanguard, Construction, and Women's Voice. Whether they are vendors, rickshaw pullers, shop assistants, elementary school students, or housewives, you can see them enthusiastically holding newspapers and magazines everywhere. There are bookstores on every street, and many teachers personally carry cardboard boxes to collect factory paper, take it back to print lecture notes, and print propaganda posters. It is said that there are also many people who come from home to run schools, and they plan to eliminate illiteracy within one year.</p>
<p>In contrast, our overseas Chinese education is really a bit of a headache. Those responsible for education are mostly overseas Chinese leaders from various groups [such as the Guangzhou Group, the Chaozhou Group]. With the brains of businessmen, they are good at saving money. How can they run outstanding schools? Middle schools spend all day reciting ancient texts, elementary schools spend all day reading the Three Character Classic. French must be read, full of the crystallization of imperialism and semi-feudal colonialism. Speaking of which, you can't blame anyone, only blame the overseas education work being done too pitifully!</p>
<p>The bookstores include Qingnian Bookstore (run by the Youth League), Qiaolian, and Dongcheng, which are nothing to see, selling some textbooks, novels, and stationery. Recently, Nanyang Gangshu Publishing Company is preparing to publish. In terms of daily newspapers, there is the Qingnian Daily, run by the Youth League, four-page broadsheet, publisher Gao Xiuwu. Before the French army opened Hanoi, it specialized in exposing the tragic situation of the overseas Chinese in Saigon, so it was greatly忌諱by the French and soon was shut down. There is the "Pacific Daily" about to be established, with an unclear background. The periodicals include "China and [indecipherable]" published by the Overseas Department, and "Zhongdang Wenlazhao". The best-selling one that is still selling well is Chiang Kai-shek's "Destiny of China". Because the spiritual food here is scarce, newspapers from Kunming and express deliveries from Nanning are quite popular and sell well here.</p>
<p>Japanese Prisoners of War Killed French Soldiers and Committed Suicide to End the Matter</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese prisoners of war have been sent away today. One part was taken by truck through Nanning to Guangzhou, and the other part boarded ships directly in Haiphong. These proud warriors of the Sun Goddess have long lost their arrogance. On the road, when they met the National Army, they would definitely bow deeply and salute. The National Army would also casually nod a little to return the salute. Sometimes they would simply ignore them. However, the prisoners of war also seemed to act according to the people they met. When they met French soldiers, they would ignore them and not step on them, passing by proudly. Once, a Japanese prisoner of war was stopped on the street by three French officers who asked him why he didn't salute. The Japanese prisoner of war replied simply: "We surrendered to China, not to you." Two French officers pulled out their guns and wanted to take care of him, but the Japanese prisoner of war kicked them to the ground, threw the two guns against the wall, and strode away. Another time, the same thing happened, and as a result, two French soldiers were killed by a Japanese prisoner of war, and the Japanese prisoner of war also committed suicide. It's quite thought-provoking. But the prisoners of war are always so obedient to the National Army. When the prisoners of war were driven to Nanning, there was only one National Army soldier on each car, and there was never any trouble. And they were all dressed in rags and ate the same coarse rice every day. In Hanoi, Japanese overseas Chinese and Japanese women are rarely seen.</p>
<p>During the four days of my stay, everything was like a fleeting glance. Apart from listening, I didn't see much. It's really hard for me to describe the actual situation in northern Vietnam. It's a bit like a firecracker that has just been lit, and a bit like gunpowder that has been soaked in water, calm for a while, tense for a while. What can be believed is that sooner or later, we will always have an extraordinary drama to watch. (May 2nd, in Nanning)</p>
<h3>Bloody Tears of Fellow Countrymen in Northern Jiangsu—Escaping from the Jaws of a Tiger, Falling into the Line of Starvation</h3>
<p>— Our Nanjing Correspondent Zhang Ming, Nanjing, May 6th</p>
<p>Eight years of hard support, all for the sake of seeing the light of day again, retaining the bloodline of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and wanting to breathe the free air of the Chinese nation again. However, today, in the days after this victory, what we have received is a long night without sunshine and endless darkness. For the past eight years, we have been displaced and wandering, as refugees. With the arrival of victory, we eagerly looked forward to returning home and becoming ordinary people in a peaceful era. Without extravagant hopes, "living and working in peace and contentment" is our only hope and also our only deserved right. However, we, the millions of fellow countrymen in northern Jiangsu, have ultimately turned this hope into an unrealizable ideal, and the deserved right into a sin that should not be enjoyed. We are still refugees, starting from the Zhenjiang and Yangzhou areas. This picture of displaced people is composed of blood and tears. Where to begin?</p>
<p>Rivers Are Stagnant Water, Roads Are Traps</p>
<p>We resisted the war and defeated the Japanese invaders, but we immediately fell under the inhuman rule of the non-human Communist troops. We have no freedom to live, because wherever the Communist troops go, all the houses are demolished. Sometimes, demolishing them is too much trouble, so they burn them all, leaving us with no place to "live". Furthermore, we have no freedom to "walk" or the right to "walk". The wide roads are destroyed and dug into rivers that are several miles long, while the places that were originally rivers are filled up in a way that is neither here nor there. Do you want to leave? The rivers are stagnant water, and the roads are traps. What's more, even if you want to leave, you still need permission. Otherwise, you are escaping, and those who escape and are caught will not survive. Of course, it is even more restricted in terms of clothing and food. If you want to dress warmly and comfortably, you will become the target of "struggle", and at the same time, you must become the person who goes to "struggle" against others. Otherwise, you will always be "stubborn", and then you will be a "Nationalist agent". It is impossible for law-abiding ordinary people to exist. They do not welcome you, but they need a part of the people as decoration. This part of the people is used to only accept orders, that is, to obey orders completely. They want you to do what they want you to do. If you disobey, you are still a "stubborn" element.</p>
<p>Digging Ports Upstream, Destroying Dams Downstream</p>
<p>Recently, in the northern Jiangsu area, they have begun two terrible acts: one is to cut down all the mature but not yet harvested crops at once. At the same time, now is the planting season. At this time when there is no room to live, there is no home to return to, how can they sow seeds? So, there is no hope for the spring harvest, and no sowing for the autumn harvest. How terrible is the future famine? They even thought of a despicable method of hoarding, searching and collecting all the stored grain, packing it into houses, and then sealing up all the walls. It is said that it is prepared as military food. That is, the word "military" comes first, the so-called "militia are the masters". Only the real people will starve to death. The second is the Huai River. The ports are dug away upstream, and the dams are destroyed downstream. Sea water is introduced, and the river water overflows. So, the people have no "place to live" and no "food to eat". This act of exterminating humanity is the main purpose of the New Fourth Army.</p>
<p>Long Journey of Displacement, Seeking Refuge in the Wilderness</p>
<p>We have an honest heart and a calm mind. Why should we be subjected to such unbridled oppression? Why can't we enjoy human rights? We wander thousands of miles, seeking survival in the wilderness, but we are unwilling to die. In Zhenjiang and Nanjing, we receive warm hospitality and relief, but our hope is: "In the military and political aspects of the country, quickly give them clarification. We want to return to our old homes, we want to use our own strength to support ourselves, and we want to go back to see our ancestors and the spirits of our ancestors under the ground!"</p>
<p>Facing this displaced refugee, the reporter says each word with a drop of tear. I want to write a word with a drop of blood to tell our so-called democratic and liberated New Fourth Army that your "democracy" at the grassroots level has already thrown itself into another democratic need. What else do you call democracy? Is it realistic to talk about democracy against the will of the absolute majority of the people? You say the people's livelihood issue is placed in the front line, but which party has solved the people's livelihood? On the contrary, the people of Suzhou have already sunk into deep water and fire, and are now in exile, exile. When will they return to their old homes? People exiled from Huai'an, Yangzhou, Taixing, Rugao, and various regions, who are staying in Nanjing, already number a considerable number. They have no means of livelihood, but fortunately, the compatriots in Nanjing are already trying to raise funds for relief. Perhaps they may be able to give them a stable place to live in the short term, but the knot is located in the place they are expecting; all parties are looking forward to a complete and concrete solution.</p>
<h3>Jinling Smoke and Clouds</h3>
<p>— Nanjing Three-Day Dispatch by Zhinan</p>
<p>In the capital, the cultural scene, strictly speaking, seems barren. There are several large daily newspapers such as the Central Daily News, the Peace Daily News, the Dagang News, and the China Daily News, all broadsheets. Smaller ones include the National Salvation Daily, the Morning News, the Xinmin Evening News, the Nanjing Evening News, and the Nanjing People's News. Although the paper quality is good, the content lacks brilliance and cannot compare with newspapers in Chongqing or Shanghai. As for magazines published in Nanjing, it seems only the Central Weekly exists; I have not seen any others.</p>
<p>Artistic Garden Scenery: From Desolation to Bustling</p>
<p>Drama is also backward. Only the "China Travel" troupe at Feilong Pavilion exists, and the atmosphere is dull. There are several cinemas such as the Dahua, Xindu, Capital, National, World, and Cultural theaters, but they mostly screen Hollywood films, and they are only sent here after being screened elsewhere. Business is also slow, and there is no queuing to buy tickets as in Chongqing. However, since the number of personnel returning to the capital continues to increase, the cinemas are also showing signs of liveliness.</p>
<p>Nanjing's Prosperity: From the Qinhuai River to the Dance Floor</p>
<p>Speaking of Jinling, people naturally think of the misty waters of the Six Dynasties. After removing the dust of the journey, people like to take a three-day tour, wandering among the mountains and rivers. The white mausoleum on Zijin Mountain remains as before, and people visiting the tomb of Dr. Sun Yat-sen come in an endless stream. The Confucius Temple in the south of the city is now more deserted than in previous years. The Qinhuai River no longer has its past picturesque scenery. The river water is murky green, and a foul smell blows in the wind. Dilapidated fish boats are moored by the bridge. Where have the beautiful women of the past drifted to? Only pairs of swallows skim across the water, chirping incessantly, as if lamenting the passage of time. Times are changing. In the past, the Qinhuai River was filled with the sound of singing and music, but now the bustle has shifted from the water to the brightly lit dance halls. The women who made a living on the Qinhuai River in the past have mostly changed their names and faces, stepping onto the dance floor and dancing in the shadows of the lights.</p>
<p>Cherries are Ripe: Agate Red and Emerald Green</p>
<p>In fact, spring is not in the dance halls but in the countryside. A few days ago, the peonies at Linggu Temple were in full bloom, a remarkable sight. I don't know if they have withered now. On Xuanwu Lake, willow catkins are flying, elm seeds are falling, and cherries are ripening, as red as agate and as green as emeralds. If you take a boat through the algae-covered waterways and row to the center of the lake, gazing at the distant green mountains and the pagoda's reflection, while peeling cherries in your hand, wouldn't it be like entering a dream?</p>
<p>American-Made New Streamlined Train</p>
<p>This is the new streamlined "Empire Builder" train of the Great Northern Railway, which is currently being rushed into production, showing a glimpse of the new train construction program. In the second half of the year, it is expected that five sets of twelve-carriage trains will be built and will run daily between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. The exterior color of the train is orange-red and green. The locomotive has 4,000 horsepower.</p>

<h3>The Youth's Call for National Affairs</h3>
<p>Today's serious situation in our country is recognized by every citizen. The Soviet army in the Northeast has just begun to withdraw, and the terrible civil war has broken out again. Marshall has come and is finding it difficult to be an intermediary. I do not stand on any party's side but, based on the standpoint of a citizen, express some opinions on national affairs.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang is the political party that once led the people of the whole country to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, the warlords, and the War of Resistance Against Japan in various revolutionary and national salvation efforts. Who can deny that these were not the merits of the Kuomintang, in theory and in fact! Looking at it from the present and from history, the Kuomintang's ideology and policies are still the guiding principles for leading the national revival. From this, it can also be seen that the Kuomintang's ruling authorities still faithfully adhere to their party platform and have not degenerated or attempted to maintain private power.</p>
<p>Their policies may have unsatisfactory aspects, and their members may also include corrupt elements, but that is not the case for the entire Kuomintang. Moreover, under the supervision of the people of the whole country, these can be corrected. Some may say, "Under the current government, the rights of the people cannot be exercised at all, so where is the power to supervise the government?" I dare not say that we are now truly democratic, nor can I predict the degree of democracy after the implementation of constitutional government, but one thing is certain: in the areas under the government's jurisdiction, there are organs and newspapers of the opposition party, and they can recklessly attack the government and the authorities. However, in the Communist areas, which are known as democratic, who has seen newspapers or books openly opposing the Communist Party?</p>
<p>In short, the Kuomintang has indelible merits, which we must not easily forget.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the Communist Party!</p>
<p>Not long ago, my thinking was also leaning to the left. At that time, I believed that the Communist Party was a political party with solutions. Under the oppression of the Kuomintang, they endured hardships in the Northwest for more than twenty years and still maintained great power, holding a considerable number of members. At the same time, each of their members was a vigorous and promising backbone, which seemed more vital than the corrupt situation of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>I also hoped that China needed a strong opposition party, not because I was afraid of "one-party dictatorship," as the democrats worried, but because it would make the ruling and opposition parties have a sense of vigilance and competition, so that they could continuously improve and strive forward.</p>
<p>So I hoped that the Communist Party was the political party of my ideals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after the Japanese surrender, I began to be disappointed in the Communist Party. Starting with Zhu De's telegram, I gradually recognized the true face of the Communist Party. It turned out to be using the banner of "people" and "democracy" but harboring evil intentions and plotting wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The biggest flaw of the Communist Party is: forcibly occupying the Northeast and obstructing transportation. Their intention is nothing but to carve out territory and create a fait accompli, thereby coercing the government so they can bargain. This policy of only pursuing the goal by any means is truly infuriating!</p>
<p>Now, the reasons the Communist Party is using are nothing more than that the government is unwilling to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but can this be used to launch a rebellious war!</p>
<p>Here, whether the government is unwilling to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference is set aside for the moment. Let us further examine: the Kuomintang is the leader in creating the Republic of China and, of course, has the right to occupy an absolute advantage in the government. However, on what grounds does the Communist Party want to occupy a superior position in the future government? Is it elected by the people or is it obtained by coercing the government? If it belongs to the latter, then the Communist Party must measure its strength. In other words, from the perspective of democracy, there is no reason for it; a political party needs to show its strength in front of the people, and only when the people willingly hand over power to it is it justified. If you abandon the fundamental and pursue the incidental and launch an offensive because of this, it is only playing with fire and destroying yourself.</p>
<p>Doesn't the Communist Party often say that it has made great contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan? I think carefully. In many famous battles, such as the Battle of Shanghai, the Battle of Xuzhou, and the Battle of Changsha... all are records of the Central Army. However, in the military front of the Communist Army, it seems that there are no such outstanding battles! But the Huangqiao Incident is a good show of the Communist Army. So-called "wandering without fighting" is fine; how can it be justified to specialize in "guerrilla warfare" against the Central Government! (There are too many such facts to enumerate) May I ask, what qualifications does the Communist Party have to dominate national policies!</p>
<p>The future of the country is too unthinkable. I pity and resent those idle youths. They are wasting their enthusiasm too meaninglessly and should not help increase the arrogance of the Communist Party or engage in dangerous disruptive work when the country needs to restore its vitality.

<h3>Removing the Shackles of Women</h3>
<p>— Wuwo</p>
<p>Although modern women have already felt the pain of oppression and shouted out the slogan of liberation, these all seem too empty in everyone's eyes: shouting slogans is of no use; we need to do practical work.</p>
<p>Being oppressed is like wearing shackles; to be liberated, the only way is to remove the shackles!</p>
<p>What are these shackles? They can be said to be nothing more than two kinds: First, the burden of giving birth to and raising children; second, the burden of cooking and managing housework. Therefore, by focusing on these two points, we can identify the goal and seek the way to liberation. What is the way to liberation?</p>
<p>First, establish state-run nurseries. Many people have already said this, but I have some things to add: The nurseries that currently exist in our country are terrible, so although there is this label, few people send their children to be raised there. Therefore, if universal state-run nurseries can be opened with complete facilities and excellent implementation of guidelines, then, undoubtedly, parents will send their children there with peace of mind, allowing them to receive great, communal education and life, and become sound talents. This is not only beneficial to the masters of the next generation, but also allows mothers to unload this part of their responsibility and do more important and beneficial work for mankind.</p>
<p>Second, establish mass dining halls. Now that the first hurdle has been broken, let's look at the second hurdle. With the establishment of universal mass dining halls, then men, women, old, and young can enjoy it comfortably, and there is no need for women to return to the kitchen. As for managing housework, it should not be done by women alone but should be the responsibility of both men and women.</p>
<p>Thus, we have found the way to liberate women. If it is done perfectly, then immediately, women can unload the shackles that have bound them for thousands of years. Liberate themselves, dedicate themselves to society and the country, serve society and the country, and do the things that should be done like men!</p>
<p>I hope that the women's community will no longer shout slogans and work hard to identify the goal and move from the way of liberation to liberation!</p>
<p>Family Education</p>
<h3>My Views on Disciplining Children</h3>
<p>— Luo Shuru</p>
<p>Everyone hopes that their children will be good, but many people do not let their children study and want to sit back and enjoy the benefits, hoping to get a few special children from fate and fortune-telling. There are also many people who only know to send their children to school and provide them with tuition, books, and stationery, and consider that they have fulfilled their responsibilities as parents. If the children are not good, they complain that the children are not up to par or curse that the school teachers are too lax.</p>
<p>Schools are certainly places to cultivate talent, but class time is only five or six hours a day, and more time is spent at home. Moreover, teachers manage hundreds or thousands of people, while parents manage only a few people, so the efficiency is faster. Therefore, family education and school education should be mutually complementary.</p>
<p>My principle for disciplining children is to set an example, so that children hear and see every day and have something to follow. Therefore, I truly restrain myself and dare not be negligent in every moment, every matter, and even every word, for fear of losing credibility in front of my children.</p>
<p>If children have requests that can be met, fulfill them after promising to do so. If a request cannot be met, explain the reasons why it cannot be met at the time and never respond vaguely or neglect it. I dare not do anything to deceive or cope with the situation. I never punish out of anger or excuse out of joy. When working with others, I always strive for honesty in everything so that the children naturally and gradually enter the right track of honesty.</p>
<p>If they get good grades, there must be rewards to inspire their desire to make progress and improve. If they do something wrong, they must be severely criticized to make them know shame and be courageous in repenting.</p>
<p>At any time and in any matter, I supplement their knowledge with common sense according to each child's level. I don't just teach them to read dead textbooks to enrich their knowledge. I pay attention to their play at all times, with the principle that it is in accordance with etiquette and does not harm their health.</p>
<p>If the school advocates donations for public welfare, then I will save on food and give money to teach them to donate, so as to cultivate their nature of being happy to do good and the habit of being responsible when things happen.</p>
<p>Once, the schools of my second and third sons needed repairs and were raising funds. My situation was certainly difficult, but I believed that it was my sons' inescapable responsibility and a necessary expense, so I tried my best to teach them to donate. "It's enough for one person to donate. Why do both people need to donate? My family has no money." The eldest son said unhappily and meditatively. "Protecting the country is the responsibility of every citizen, and protecting the school is the responsibility of every student. Everyone should have the courage to be responsible and should not shirk responsibility. Since they are two people studying, they should donate as two people so that they understand that each person is willing to take on their own responsibility." I replied and taught slowly. My son thought it made sense. So they each wrote it down in their diaries. It can be seen that children have weak wills and seem to hesitate and linger at the crossroads of right and wrong at all times. If you can point them in the right direction at any time, they will naturally go the right way without being beaten or scolded.</p>
<p>I dare not say that the children I discipline are good, but as far as I can see, the older ones are already able to stand on their own, and the younger ones are very obedient and love to study. I often hear people say to me: "How can you discipline your children so well? I can beat my children to death, and they still won't listen. The good ones don't need to be managed, and the bad ones are exhausting!" So today, I thought of writing this to let mothers understand that there is nothing good or bad when children are born. Like a small tree, you cultivate and irrigate it, cut off wild branches, and protect the straight-growing trunk to achieve the goal of growing into a useful pillar. Don't use beating alone to discipline them; it is still "setting an example" and "gradually guiding" that is important.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. At this time of gender equality, we women must also take half the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. Disciplining children for the country's use is not our women's responsibility to love the country?</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Song</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Pumpkin vine, looped at both ends,</p>
<p>Being a daughter-in-law is truly hard.</p>
<p>The father-in-law watches, the mother-in-law stares,</p>
<p>Afraid I'll secretly give rice to my own mother.</p>
<p>Father-in-law, mother-in-law,</p>
<p>Don't worry!</p>
<p>My family isn't poor.</p>
<p>We eat rice from the previous year,</p>
<p>We live in high-tiled houses,</p>
<p>We wear silk and satin,</p>
<p>We sleep on ivory beds,</p>
<p>There's no need to steal rice for my own mother.</p>
<p>This song vividly depicts the suspicion between a daughter-in-law and her in-laws. The disharmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is a common phenomenon in Chinese society.</p>
<p>How to reconcile the emotions between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law? This cannot be said in a few words. In short, those who are mothers-in-law must always think for their daughters-in-law, and those who are daughters-in-law should also always forgive their mothers-in-law. When both sides understand each other, all opinions and disputes will disappear invisibly.</p>

<h3>Whooping Cough</h3>
<p>— Huamei</p>
<p>Whooping cough, known in the West as Whooping Cough. In ancient China, it was called Luhe cough, and in folk terms, it is commonly called Dun cough. All are named after the nature of the cough and are a type of infectious disease. The sputum and sneezes of patients are all media for transmission. This disease occurs most often in spring. Patients are mostly children under ten years old, especially those under three years old. If children under one year old contract the disease, it is often fatal. It is occasionally contracted by those over ten years old, but it is rare.</p>
<p>The bacteria that cause whooping cough are Bordet-Gengou Bacillus. The route of transmission to the human body is the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it is easiest to contract whooping cough after suffering from measles or a cold. Although the transmission is not as fast as measles or a cold, any child who comes into contact with a patient is at risk of contracting the disease.</p>
<p>After contracting the bacteria that cause whooping cough, after an incubation period of four to fifteen days, a cough similar to bronchitis will occur. The severity gradually increases, turning into a cough like the flu. It is worse at night than during the day. At this time, the sick child sometimes has a slight fever. After a week, it gradually becomes a paroxysmal cough, and the sound of the cough comes from within the trachea. Therefore, there is a hissing ending. At the same time, the sick child's appetite decreases (there are also those whose appetite remains normal), sleeps poorly at night, has a puffy face, and swollen eyelids. The lower eyelids are purplish-red.</p>
<p>Paroxysmal coughing is the characteristic of whooping cough. As for the number of attacks, if the attacks occur during sleep, they are more frequent at night than during the day. If the attacks occur during play, they are sudden. There is often a special precursor before the cough attack, such as restlessness or suddenly rushing into the mother's arms. Other things such as rapid breathing, eating too quickly, crying, anger, etc. can also cause a cough attack. If a severe cough occurs after breastfeeding or eating, it is often prone to vomiting.</p>
<p>The course of whooping cough is quite long. If the patient does not receive appropriate treatment early (whooping cough serum treatment), it can be extended to two or three months. Therefore, it is called "hundred days." However, with a child's physique, after such a long period of suffering, the physical torment is already unbearable. Therefore, in less than a month, the child is already thin, malnourished, pale, with a puffy face, slightly protruding eyes, and dark circles due to the rupture of small blood vessels during severe coughing. The condition can be said to be very dangerous. During the illness, dangerous complications such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and meningitis can occur at any time.</p>
<p>At first glance, whooping cough does not seem to be an absolutely dangerous disease, but if you carefully count the causes of death in various children, you will find that the number accounted for by whooping cough is quite alarming, and most of those who die are children under two years old (generally, children under two years old account for more than 80% of whooping cough deaths). Among the types of childhood deaths, whooping cough accounts for 12% of the total.</p>
<p>The characteristics of whooping cough, such as the unique crying sound and paroxysmal coughing, are evidence for diagnosis. This is a unique phenomenon in respiratory diseases, but the spasm-like cough with that cry must be more subtle in the first week. Sometimes, because the child is too young, even if the cough is paroxysmal, they cannot make a crying sound. Therefore, when diagnosis is difficult, a bacteriological examination can be used to determine the disease. The method is to send the child's saliva or nasal mucus to any medical examination laboratory. They will be able to provide reliable proof. In addition, the patient's face has special changes, such as swollen eyelids, dark eye circles, and a puffy face, which can also be evidence of whooping cough.</p>
<p>Whooping cough has a special treatment, which is the currently popular vaccine therapy (whooping cough serum therapy). This method is the fastest and has no adverse side effects. As long as unexpected complications have not yet formed, no matter how serious the patient's symptoms are, it can work wonders. But treatment is, of course, better the earlier it is. If treatment is started before the cough even starts, it can be cured in just one week. Otherwise, it takes six to twelve injections, which takes twelve days to a month to cure.</p>

<h3>Little Cotton-Padded Jacket</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shufang</p>
<p>This is a small silk cotton-padded jacket, which is still suitable for the current climate and is for children around one year old.</p>
<p>Materials: More than two feet of beige small silk, more than two feet of lake-blue small silk, or more than four feet of material in one color, lake-blue silk thread or colored silk thread.</p>
<p>Method: Cut according to the size in the diagram, slightly enlarged to allow for seams. If you like the same color on the face and lining, you can cut two pieces of the same material. Fill with a little thin silk cotton. After making the small cotton-padded jacket, draw a pattern on thin paper, sew it onto the place where you want to make the flowers with a large needle, and make the shape with matching silk thread. After it is done, tear off the paper. The pattern is simple and depends on each person's skills and preferences. If you don't want to make silk cotton, you can make a velvet lining, which looks just as good. It's cheaper and more distinctive to give as a gift than to buy in the market.</p>
