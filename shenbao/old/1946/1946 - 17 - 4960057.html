<p>〔本報重慶十六日電〕周恩來申述黨軍來源稱：國民學領導軍隊，確有其革歷史，而中共亦係被迫拿起槍桿。曾琦同情前者係因黃埔練軍，北伐統一，固有理由；後者亦有苦衷。陸定一於申述軍隊國家化與政治民主化應並進時，再三釋述中共軍隊是被逼上梁山不睡，對周恩來之言，下一解釋注脚。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十五日電〕中共代表董必武，今日在政治協商會議提議，主張將國府主席權力大加削減，用以答覆國民學代表所提之政府改組案。共黨提案中建議，凡主席所頒發命令，俱須經國府會議批准，國府會議則須重加改組，綱羅各黨各派人士參加，成爲全國最高決策機關。會議三分之二通過，即可否決主席之舉措。協商會議中本日雖互發指現言論，但大體上進行順利。共產黨力請採取三·三一制，即全國政治之指導權，由國民黨共產黨及無派三個單位各以三分之一代表出席。</p>

<h3>協商會議第六次會　討論軍隊國家化　放下槍桿才能講民主憲政</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十六日電〕政治協商會議第六次會議，於十六日上午九時舉行，到會員王雲五等三十人。議題爲軍事類問題，有靑年黨及民主同盟兩提案，分由陳會員啓天，梁委員漱溟，加以說明。大會並請由軍政部林次長蔚出席報告整軍經過情形。張羣·周恩來·邵力子·曾琦·張東蓀·張申府·陸定一諸氏，相繼就軍隊國家化問題，發表意見，並決定由分組委員會歸納各項意見，再提大會討論。會議開始時，雷秘長震報吿出席會員人數，主席孫科請陳會員啓天說明其提案。陳氏首述提案用意：（一）結東糾紛，完成團結。（二）集中精力加强建設。（三）加強團結，停止內戰。（四）統一精編，堅固國防。陳氏强調軍隊國家化，乃對外作爲充實國防力世，同非對內作戰之武力之謂。在槍桿下講民主，講憲政，是假的。必須放下槍桿，始可講民主，講憲政。陳氏旋逐一解釋其所提實行軍隊國家化辦法。民主同盟提　，梁漱溟氏說明，渠同意靑年黨所提軍隊國家化之主張，然着重大量裁兵，而積極從事建設現代根本國防，即（一）科學研究，（二）工業建設，（三）普及國民軍訓三者，俾加强國防力量，共謀世界和平。渠並主張　立一　軍計劃委員會，執行軍隊國家化，及裁減常備兵之任務，分期完成。張羣氏謂，根據政府與中共會談紀要第九項，中共軍隊將要縮編。關於數　及駐地問題，並已經雙方同意，由軍事三人小組商討。不幸後囚發生軍事衝突，小組工作延未進行，現停止衝突命令雖已生效，然迎日各地尙有發生衝突之報吿，故三人小組會，　有迅即成立之必要。蔣主席並　定張部長治中及本人，爲政府代表，中共代表爲周恩來，已於昨日開始初步商談，希望在一個月之內，商談辦法商定，後兩個月內，整編完竣。並自商定之日起，中共軍隊應即接受國民政府統一指揮。張氏希望三人小組會議，能達成其任務。</p>
<p>〔衆社重慶十六日電〕今日協商會議在國府禮堂中舉行，商討改編與減少中國軍隊之困難問題。靑年黨領袖陳啓天，提出改編軍隊之廣泛綱領，主張設一國防部長與一統一指揮部。渠要求軍隊應與政黨脫離關係，僅能用以抵抗外侮，並建議由一立法國體監督軍隊，其數量應立即減至一百師，以後再減至六十師。渠　主張組織一委員會，負責實行改編與復員工作。民主同盟領袖梁漱溟在原則上同意陳啟天之建　，主張改編委員會應有委員五至七人，包括美國顧問三人，以執行一兩年計劃。周恩來即提出國軍與共產軍應同時實行改編。渠同意在六個月內將共軍減至廿師。邵力子曾琦提議，軍事問題由共黨與國民黨單獨解決，但其餘代表力主軍事問題係與全體人民有關之問題，不應由兩黨單獨解決。軍政部次長林蔚提議，在本年上半年內，將國軍之人數由四百八十三萬人減至一百八十萬人，即由二百五十三師減至九十師，外加騎兵十營，及其他特殊隊伍。分期實行，每期三個月，裁減之兵員應使担任公共工程，以二十萬人修築鐵路，二十萬人修築公路，十六萬人從事浚河工程。裁減之軍官，除一部份派送中央訓練團使受職業及技術訓練外，其餘悉予復員。</p>
<h3>林次長報告整軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十六日電〕軍政部次長林蔚，十六日出席政治協商會議，報吿整軍設施，其報吿全文如下：主席，諸位先生，本席奉命報吿整軍計劃及實施經過，擬分爲去年度整軍情况及本年度整軍計劃兩個階段報吿，茲分別說明如左：</p>
<p>去年度整軍情况：第一，整軍之原因檢討我國軍必須整編之原因，　自二十六年抗戰開始之際，部隊總額爲四九軍，一二八師，三十旅，隨後因戰局之開始，戰塲逐年擴大，至三十三年底止，擴張至一二九軍，三五四師，三十一旅，十五營。此種擴張率，大的不過兩倍，就戰爭動員之原則，並揆之各國戰例，原屬不大，無如部隊素質低下，缺額逐漸增加，番號雖增，戰力反遜，不得不整編者，此其一。次則由國家財力，物力有限，人民所受痛苦已深，實無法再縱續負祖如此龐大之軍費，不得不整編者，此其二。總之，整編國軍不獨爲國人一致之要求，即盟邦人士亦莫不一致希望。此種整軍政策，關係抗戰勝負與國家命脈，中央原早有定策，祇以環境關係，直至去年方得決定實行。本部稟承中央決策，於去年初開始努力執行。第二，整軍之目的　整軍之目的，在使現在龐大複雜之軍隊調整爲必要而充實之國軍，換言之，整軍並非消極的裁軍，而乃積極的充實部隊作戰力量。在敵人未投降以前，即以之準備反攻，今後則以之鞏固防，並協同盟邦維持世界之永久和平，故本部所定三十四年　軍方針，一爲配合反攻要求，並充實作戰力量，二爲配合國家預算，並顧及國家財力，物力。第三，整軍中心工作，整軍中心工作，概分爲（一）部隊改編與充實，（二）改善官兵生活。（三）調整軍事機構，（四）安置編餘官兵。部隊改編與充實，是乃加强部隊力量最重要之工作，本部衡量抗戰要求與部隊情勢，：策定卅四年整編實施原則如次（一）各部隊一律裁减三分之一。又爲實施整編便利起見，即以每個戰區爲整編單位，即戰區內轄有三個軍者，應裁一個軍，三師制之軍，即被併一個師，兩師制之軍，其整編辦法有二，如兩個師均保留番號，但各師均自行縮减一個團，所缺乏之一個團，則另由其他部隊撥補，以充實其建制。如祗保留眾部及一個師，則須撤銷一個師番號，以其士兵撥補軍部直屬部隊與所保留之師，另撥其他已整編完成之一個師，以充實其建制。（二）各部隊整編方案，係由本部接原則擬定，由戰區負責實施，如戰區依實際困難有所變動時，祇要不違反原則，本部概可核准（三）整編部隊之編餘士兵，一律補充，而整編所保留部隊之缺額，以部隊中之空番號滅少，而實力充裕（四）凡每一部隊遵照整編原則實施整編完畢後，即可開始發給新給與，如未遵照原則整編之部隊，則仍發舊給與，如某部隊先整編完畢，（未完）</p>
<h3>張瀾等九人提案</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十六日電〕張會員瀾等九人，向政治協商會議第六次會議中提「實現軍隊國家化並大量裁兵」案，全文如次：同人主張本會議爲奠定國家統一，並樹立現代國防起見，應通過下列兩原則：（一）全國所有軍隊，應即脫離任何黨派關係，而歸屬於國家，達到軍令軍政之完全統一（現役軍人脫離黨籍）。（二）大量裁减常備軍額，而積極從事科學研究工業建設，而一面普及國民軍訓，以爲現代國防根本之圖。　爲實現上列第一原則及第二原則大量裁兵之一點，應即成立一整軍計劃委員會，此委員會以委員五人至七人組織之，包括左列種人員：（一）國內兩黨之軍事人員，（二）非兩黨之軍事人員，（三）軍事人員，同時並聘美國軍事專家一人至三人，爲此委員會之顧問，必要時得被邀出席會議或受委託，而協助計劃工作，限期一個月內製訂一切實可行之具體計劃。此計劃一面要達成軍隊統一於國家之目標，一而要裁減常備軍額至可能之最少限度，但無妨於兩年內分期完成。</p>
<p>上項計劃，由委員會提交本會議審核通過後，經由國民政府執行之，在執行時，仍由該委員會負監督老核之責，直至任務完成爲止，以上所陳是否有當，敬請大會公決。提案人張瀾·梁漱溟·羅隆基·黃炎培·沈鈞儒·張中府·張東蓀·張君勃·章伯　。</p>
<h3>榮軍復員計劃已擬定</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明十六日電〕全國榮軍復員計劃，據悉軍政部業已擬訂，俊呈請最高當局核定後，即可實施，該計劃擬將現有之榮軍管理處十一處改組爲榮譽軍人善後管理局，全國將設五局，並附設屯墾團，生產組合與榮軍子弟學校。</p>
<h3>長興設指揮所孫元良兼主任</h3>
<p>〔中央社長興十六日電〕徐州行營第一綏靖區長興指揮所主任，由孫元良兼任，已經成立，開始綏靖工作，所轄區域爲蘇，浙，皖，邊區，宜興，溧陽，吳興，嘉興，廣德，寗國，蕪湖，宣城等二十縣，京滬綏靖工作督導團，亦隨同出發各地，展開督導工作？</p>
<h3>調處部雖已工作衝突仍續有發生</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕軍事調處執行部，定十六日在協和醫院開始辦公。羅濱遜，鄭介民，葉劍英，今日上午曾就此事，有所討論。記者今日詢問三方人員，停止衝突情形如何，均以電合尙未架起，未接各方報吿爲答。三委員並相約，以後遇事發表公報，不單獨發表談話。昨今兩日，三氏皆單獨活動，葉劍英今日下午往訪孫長官，熊市長，聞李宗仁主任，今晚歡迎軍事調處執行部到平人員。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕軍事調處執行部，將派由國共美三方組成之小組，赴各衝突地區，調查眞相，並執行調處。預計每一百里即有一組，數逾四百之調處執行部人員，即將源源飛來。當局對此數目龐大之賓客招待事宜，頗費用章，黃仁霖已考慮使「北京」「六國」兩大飯店之次要客人移出，以容納彼等和平者。使當局爲便利共方人員居住計，已指定翠明莊，爲某專用住所。該大厦亦在東城，戰前爲梅蘭芳公館，淪陷期日人作迎賓之用，勝利後往返重慶長春間之東北工作人員，多棲止於此。軍事調處執行部三組人員，明日即在停閉已久之協和醫院開始辦公。淪陷期曾被日人視爲三大外僑政治犯之一之該院總務司長鮑文，已爲彼等騰出大部上好房間備用。飽文氏以愉快之語氣語記者，當局來借本院爲軍事調處執行都辦公地點，余即欣然允諾，蓋彼等之偉大任務，關係中國和平與世界大局甚鉅，本院能爲彼等之辦公處所·實不勝光榮之止。停止衝突命令發佈後第一二日，政府與共黨雙方俱接有繼續衝突之尾聲，如呂文貞十三日晚吿記者，十二日十三日共軍出襲情報有十餘項之多。葉劍英下機後談話，亦云飛機自渝起飛時，尙接有凌源古北口衝突報告。但至今日，北方衝突情報，確已日漸沉寂。平市糧價·亦日有降落·市民瘦削之面部，亦漸多笑容。</p>
<h3>吳部長盼共黨　放棄無謂宣傳</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十六日電〕中宣部長吳國楨今日招待記者時，對共黨指摘「國軍違反停止衝突命令」一點，表示極大遺憾，深盼共黨能放棄「無意識之宣傳」，對於外傳蔣夫人已赴瀋陽一說，吳部長拒絕加以評論。</p>
<h3>軍調處部發表公告</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕軍事調處執行部，十五日晚十一時半，發表第一號新聞公吿如次，軍事調處執行部，爲制止各地仍在進行之局部衝突起見，已定於明十六日，派遣美國海軍陸戰隊飛機，往綏魯冀各省十四城市村莊，散發停止衝突之命令，幷已於今晨在熱河省之赤峯，投散上項命今。軍事調處執行部，根據政府軍之報吿，古北口西南區之南香峪，及綏遠省境內之卓資山，集寗，豐鎭，歸綏，武川及和林等六處，衝突仍在進行，決於十六日晨，派機往上列各處，投停止衝突命令。歸綏爲國軍在綏省之駐防司令部所在地，共軍則駐於集寗及豐鎭武川及和林，據聞亦有小規模衝突發生。冀西南之永年縣，除投散停止衝突命令外，且將同時投散執行部三委員簽署之通吿，准予糧食貨物通過衝突地帶，以解救當地人民之飢饉。在津浦綫方面，執行部變決定在連鎮，東光，泊頭及滄縣等四處，投散停止衝突之命令，以制止該地區之衝突。濟南以南約八十英里之兗州，及運河邊近之聊城，亦將投散同樣之命令。軍事調處執行部除派遣美國陸戰隊飛機前往衝突區域外，執行部委員幷宣布即將於最近派遣停戰執行小組，往各衝突區域，與各該地區部隊指揮官取得聯繫，調查實地情形，報吿本部。</p>
<h3>東北行營將遷回長春　瀋陽市民迎國軍</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕東北局勢日漸良好，原擬由平遷錦之東北行營，現又擬遷回長春。我軍定今日進入瀋陽，熊式輝擬隨軍前往視察，二十日左右返平。蔣夫人最近確將偕蔣經國飛長一行，長春歡迎事宜，已由中蘇雙方共同籌備。安東大連尙無新消息，備感焦灼之高惜冰主席，最近或將赴長春一行，早求解決。大迎沈怡市長，刻猶遨遊青島未歸，想係利用大連問題未決定前之閒暇，儘量觀觀　青島市政，以爲大通施政參攷。興安吳炎章主席，連日因東北大雪，習機無法降落，行期一再展緩，今日見本報記者即說，如果看報，我已經飛畏春四五天了。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十六日電〕外交部東北特派員蔣經國，昨日晉謁蔣委員長，日內即飛赴北平，轉東北長春。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十五日電〕國軍今日下午三時半進入瀋陽，民羣集皇姑屯車站歡迎，全市懸旗，熱烈情形，空前未有。</p>

<h3>救濟收復區房荒　宋院長已擬定整個計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕重慶訊：行政院院長宋子文返渝後，曾將收復區之一般嚴重房荒情形面陳蔣主席，當蒙主席核准，由四行借款八萬萬元予京市府，以充興建之用，現京市工務冋正在加緊設計趕辦中。聞宋院長頃已擬定救濟收復區房荒之整個計劃，借款方式將略仿京市，區域將包括滬·漢·粵·桂·柳州·梧州·長沙·津·平·濟南·太原·徐州·鄭州各大都市，辦法不日即可公布。</p>
<h3>臨棗共軍未停犯擾</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十六日加急電〕截至十五日午夜止·包圍棗莊臨城之共軍，仍未停止其攻勢。現津浦路臨棗支路全綫，砲火連天，在停戰限期以前，一度被國軍逐出煤鑛之共軍，增援後頃又逼近煤鑛。守衛鑛坑之鑛警，已傷亡殆盡。鑛工現正與其家屬，使用各種笨重之武器，與共軍作殊死戰。原來協助守衛棗莊煤鑛之國軍。爲數甚微，且恪遵停戰命令。不取任何積極行動。彼等目睹數百無辜鑛工之家屬，被瘋在之共軍任性殺戮，憤火中燒，而又不能遠令應戰，多痛哭失聲，大罵共產黨喪盡天良。彼等於十四日深夜，曾幾次要求其長官，准許辭却軍職，願以平民身份。與共軍拼命。國軍之部隊長，則堅不允許，且含淚曉以大義。昨夜徐州以北，朔風大吼，滴水成冰，該處國軍，旣未備戰，野戰病院已泰半結束，以至從臨棗各地抬下之受傷軍民，行列由擔架上流下滴血成冰，冰屑墮地，紅白相間，慘不忍覩。一曾任鑛工子弟學校之敎員，仰臥擔架上，慘呼共產黨好狠心呀，請重慶南京上海的記者先生們，來看看這人間地獄罷！</p>
<h3>傳作義四辭未准</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕重慶來人談：傳作義四辭十二戰區司令長官及綏主席未准，蔣主席且溫慰有加，駐華盟軍將領及記者對傳均極推崇，去秋魏德邁將軍由緩西檢閱傅部返渝後，曾譽傳爲罕有之良將。外傳傅因共黨向政府要求罷其軍職而萌辭意不確。</p>
<h3>粵槍決女間諜</h3>
<p>（合衆社廣州十六日電）有黃美麗者（女性，譯音），被控與日本人合作，充任間諜，已於昨日槍決。此人現年二十五歲，幼年居住日本，日軍佔領廣州後，即與一日本人結婚，被控爲日本人搜集有關中國之軍事情報。</p>
<h3>要聞簡報</h3>
<p>本報昆明電　中央航　司昆廣錢客機，因機師不敷分配，十四日起減爲每週一班。該公司尙有飛機數架在印度，不日將飛昆使用。</p>
<p>重慶電　新任法大使梅理　今日在國府呈遞國書，需用禮堂，政治協商會改下午三時舉行，議題爲國民大會問題。</p>
<h3>接收東北工礦孫越琦偕專家飛長春　莫斯科談判曾獲協議</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕負責接收工礦之孫越琦。十四日由渝專機返平，同來者有專家廿餘人。孫明晨即飛長春，接洽接收工礦事宜。據消息靈通者稱：中蘇在莫斯科之談判中，似對工礦問題，已獲協議，中國將與蘇聯合辦若千廠礦。蔣經國莫斯科之行，似有相當成功。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕東北工礦問題，已有擭得解決之顯明徵象。蔣經國返渝聲中，最高當局十日以長途電話召負責接收工礦之孫越琦赴渝，孫當於十一日飛渝請示。今日此間接孫來電云：今日即專機北飛，在平作一夜宿，十六日即轉飛長春，接收東北工礦，且已指定在平之專家胡安愷·許應期·馬師亮·孫文藻·　介民·楊之屏·陶永明·杜春宴·余昌菊·楊允植十一人同行。目前東北工礦之接收工作，已局部開始，皆由蘇方派員同往。據悉：東北重要廠礦機器設備，運出國外者，並不算多，有一部份遺失機器，仍在東北境內，於某種情形之下，此等機器可望重返其崗位工作。蔣經國在蘇交涉工礦詳細結果，截至發電時，此間尙無所悉。一般判斷，蘇方或將以其技術資本，參加於東北若干廠礦。</p>
<p>〔聯合社錦州十五日電〕國軍在東九省接收各地，進慶遲緩，顯示東北經濟特派員張嘉璈與馬林諾夫斯基現在長春進行之談判，至關重要。談判癓結似在擬定蘇聯參預東九省各項事業之詳細辦法。迄至目前爲止，官方並未表示蘇聯軍隊將延至二月一日以後退出東九省。中國當局亦仍假定在該月之後可完成接收工作，但據此間多數觀察家所信，馬林諾夫基大部分軍隊，恐未必能在今後十八日之內撤退完舉。此一推測有種種理由；若干人以爲冬令氣候不利於調動軍隊，另有若干人稱：蘇聯方面在長春鐵路上未能獲得充分之煤以行駛火車。但最有力之理由，則爲中蘇經濟談判，尙有若干要點未獲解決。聯合社記者由此間最可靠方面獲悉談判中各要點之性質，祇是未能由蘇聯方面證實其說耳。第一，開蘇聯要求在東九省各主要城市，如哈爾濱·長春·瀋陽，取得商用機塲，俾與大連自由港，及旅順海軍根據地互相聯接。並擬日中蘇邊境之滿洲里，敷設電話綫直通大迎。第二，聞蘇聯要求共管東九省之一半重工業，煤鐵亦在其內。第三，蘇聯人曾自日人處購置產業，擬繼續在中國領土保留其所有權，上述谷點，中國方面尙未予以確切答復。張嘉璈經中央政府核准採取之立塲，聞爲凡有涉及蘇聯權益者，概須以四十一年前日俄戰爭前俄國在滿洲權益爲談判基礎。略言之，此即中東鐵路所有權，松花江航行權，鐵路區械之購地權，開　伐木權，電話電報綫之設置及運用權，郵政及司法權，免向中國政府納稅權，及鐵路區域之管理權。但聞馬林諾夫斯基所取立塲則爲，日本在東九省建立重工業，係凖備與蘇聯及聯合國作戰，故戰爭之結果，蘇聯有權將東九省工業取作戰利品，據權威方面消息，此點猶在四强間商討中。此問關於重工業設備及機械被有系統拆移之說，傳聞甚多，若干人以爲蘇聯仍將歸還各工廠設備，但必以蘇聯預聞各廠事業爲條件。惟許多傳聞祇是道聽途說。中國方面對於東九省大多數工業，尙無細加檢視之機會，非俟完全控制東九省後，無從佔計工業損失程度。據中國官員稱：錦州各麵粉及紡織廠，其拆毀程度即不如最初所傳之　，故對於東九省其他各工業區所傳出消息，皆不能盡信。須俟大煤鐵鑛及工廠經澈底檢查後，方有定論。若干傳說又謂，各鐵路上火車頭及運貨列車大多失踪。自長城至新民一段狹小地帶，火車頭及列車確所剩無多。據傳：有車頭二千集中韓國北部邊境附近之某地，但此說亦未能證實。另一傳說，謂有滿載供應品之火車，駛往蘇聯境內之滿洲里，但亦未證實。</p>

<h3>我代表顧給鈞演說　促速確立託治制　中國堅決信仰集體和平源則　願盡全力助聯合國完成使命</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕中國首席代表顧維鈞博士，昨繼伊朗代表之後，向聯合國大會發表演說，希望勿得遲延速即成立託治委員會。其言有謂，託治制度爲委治制顯著之進步，數千萬人民均將受其利益，託治制度可加速委治地人民政治，經濟，社會及敎育之發展，使建立自治政府完成獨立之志願，得以早日實現。中國決盡全力以助聯合國使命之完成，中國人民堅決信仰集體和平之原則，且願以國家利益，附屬於集體安全之下，故知聯合國不能亦決不致失敗。籌備委員會所建議由經濟社會理事會設立之五委員會，其屬於人權之委員會，位居首自要，實爲良好之現晚，聯合國當以不分種族，性別，語言，宗敎之異點，鼓勵並尊重人民之權利及自由爲其主要原則，此乃全球人民深感興趣之事件。持久之和平，應以尊重個人之尊嚴爲前提。顧博士對於禁毒委員會之設，亦表感謝，蓋自戰事發生以來，吸毒之人愈益增多，在每次戰爭中，敵人即在遠東推行毒化政策，故禁毒乃當前亟務云？</p>
<p>（路透社倫敦十六日電）昨夜聯合國機構大會，於荷蘭首相希摩霍恩致詞究畢，行將散會時，會長史巴克宣佈英外相貝文將於星期四晨十時三十分（上海時間午後六時三十分）演說，大會定今最　論筹委會之報吿書，屆時發言者將爲蕯爾伐多，厄瓜多，挪威之代表，阿根廷，哥侖比亞，墨西將及波蘭之代表則在下午致詞。星期四晨發言者，除貝文外尙有兩人。星期四午後安全理事會將集會，大會則不舉行會議。星期五有十人致詞，代表印度，捷克，澳大利，南非洲，委內瑞拉，南斯拉夫，加拿大，希臘，白俄羅斯，烏克蘭及法國。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕貝文外相之演說，將宜示英國凖備以其委治地移交聯合國之託治理事會，惟關於巴勒斯坦則須俟英美合組之巴勒斯坦調查委員會提出報吿後，始能有所決定。具文並將宣示英翻政府之意見，認爲現在委治下之外約但，已至可以成爲獨立國之階段。又據倫敦關係方面透露葉門王國或將於明年聲請加人聯合國，外的但酋長阿杜拉或將於下月來倫敦，典英政府及聯合國方面進行商談。外的但今亦未曾加入聯合國，其主權被承認以後，或不及於本屆大會結束前，完成　請人會之手續。</p>
<h3>聯合國大會　辯論第二日　觸及伊朗東印問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日〕聯合國機構大會自上週在倫敦召開以來，昨夜始初次深刻明瞭世界「危險地點」問題之迫切性，尤以中東與亞洲兩地爲然，昨在大會一般大辯論之第二日，伊朗·中國·及荷蘭代表均起發言。亞塞爾拜然之爭執，印度尼西亞之紛擾，及原子彈之威脅，乃爲各代表最關心之事。蘇聯代表團長葛洛米柯以手支頤，肅然端坐，聆取伊朗代表團畏泰奎柴丹發言，宣佈伊朗保留將伊朗問題提交大會討論之權，並謂伊朗爲顧全大局，未要求將伊朗問題列入本屆會議之議程中，然此問題若不擭在會塲外早日解決，則伊朗或將提請大會考量。伊朗代表詞畢，場中掌聲輕弱，且鼓掌者不無尷尬之狀。掌聲旣息，蘇聯代表與蘇維埃烏克蘭代表間，立刻分別討論，當見蘇維埃烏克籣代表席中，馬努爾斯基搖首並以手作不然之狀。最先述及印度尼西亞者，爲荷蘭首相希摩霍恩，謂荷印已有社會變革發生，此變革已「近乎社會革命」，荷方正會同印度尼西亞人民「以激進之熊度，」處理此問題。歐亞兩洲被壓迫人民之熱情，非戰前者可比，彼等無論在肉體上精神上，均已感受因戰爭而不受約束的殘暴行爲之恥辱結果，不啻身　阿鼻地獄，因此各該國家俱冀求新的政治改革云。原子彈問題，亦係希摩霍恩所提出，謂在短時期內，其他許多張國述小强在內，均將得悉原子能爆裂之秘齊，人類進化已達危急階段，欲以政策置於人道原則之穩固基礎上，僅剩一短促之時間矣。希摩霍恩繼又促請迅速成立託管制度，謂荷代表國確信託管地區人民之意見與願望，應予計及，如何「聽取此等人民自身之呼聲，」當爲應加討論的最重要問題之一云。中國首席代表顧維鈞博士繼起發言。附議此迅速設立託管理事會之計劃，（演辭見前）</p>
<p>聞大會秘書處所接世界各地發來之串請書，多如雪片，內有在印度之印度尼西亞靑年聯合會等四個不同團體，均要求立刻解決印度尼亞問題。此項要求與「愛爾蘭問題」，暨斯洛伐克。阿爾美尼亞兩國民議會要求在聯合國機構中各佔一席等，將由特設之小組委員會處理之。</p>
<h3>原子能武器　供保安之用　安全會主席之建議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕聯合國機構安全理事會，定本星期四舉仃首次會議。按照大會臨時規則，將依照谷理事國之第一字母按次輪流主席。澳洲海長梅金已由該國政府指定爲安全理事會理事，將担任首次會議主席。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕有望當選爲聯合國安全理事會主席負責組織國際保安軍之澳洲首席代表梅金昨發表談話，主張以原子能武器供國際軍，作保陣世界和平之用。梅氏聲稱：聯合國憲章已規定聯合各會員國之軍力及資源，以維持國際之和平與安全。憲章簽字時，原子能之秘密雖極少爲人所共知，然原子武器之性質，核與憲章所定關於分配軍力·協助·便利之一般規定，尙無不能吻合之處。原子能並非僅能用作破壞。如能爲全世界人民之經濟及物質利益而使用。未始不能具有重大之建設力量。</p>
<h3>安全理事會顧維鈞出席</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十五日電〕我政府已指派駐英大使顧維鈞爲我國出席聯合國安全理事會代表，駐蘇大使傳秉常爲副代表。</p>
<h3>組織國際警察辦法在考慮中</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕據消息靈通方面宣稱：美國軍隊充任聯合國警察，擬依照地理分佈，以便任何地點發生侵略行爲，隨時開往彈壓。詳細辦法美國正在考慮中，以待日後與中英蘇法四國參謀委員會商議。美國所根據之原則如下：每一地理單位，應包括海空力量相等之部隊，員額多寡應依兩項因素決定，即（一）處理事件本身所需要，（二）維持聯合國軍事的威嚴與政治的威嚴相等所必需。關於後者殆指所遺部隊員額，須較軍事需要者爲多。每一國家將依據其資源攤派軍隊，因此美英兩國或將供給海空軍，而蘇聯則供給陸軍。美國此項計劃，須經國會通過。</p>
<h3>關於人權宣言決定縝密研究</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕聯合國大會印度首席代表慕達里亞吿本社訪員稱，聯合國經濟社會理事會日內召開會議時，將決定所屬人權委會之組織。古巴代表曾建議由大會討論人權，並發表個人及國家之權利宣言，惟以本屆全體大會僅以討論各種機構，並設定各理事會爲其任務，故人權問題自可不必在大會中討論。原子能問題，以其過於重要，故已列人大會議程以內，惟發表人權宣言一事，並非將予延期討論。經社理事會首屆會議中即當研究此事。舊金山會議中原已談及男女人權之問題，憲章亦已明文規定，經社理事會應設立人權委員會，憲章中之明文規定委員會者亦僅此一人權委員會而已。余意於人權委會向經社理事會提出之報吿於送達全體大會時，不妨由後者考慮發表人權宣言。預料大會第二階段中，即可論及此事。適當之程序當爲由大會視該項宣言爲一種公約，交各會員國採納</p>
<h3>兩國小組委會處理各方要求</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕聯合國常務委員會昨夜委派中國與委內瑞拉爲小組會委員，以處理全世界各地少數民族及各團體紛向大會秘書處提出之種種要求，其中第一項爲印度尼西亞問題，係「在印度之印度尼西亞靑年聯合會」等四團體所提出之要求，羅馬尼亞兩團體提出猶太人問題，波蘭聯合總會及阿爾美尼亞國民委員會則要求派代表出席聯合國機構大會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕聯合國總務委會今日宣布義政府來電申請入會。蘇代表葛洛米柯反對將該電轉達安全理事會，最後由比外畏即大會主席史巴克表示意見，謂該項申請人會電，應予特別備案。</p>
<h3>東印度總理聲明</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十六日電〕印度尼西亞共和國總理夏沙利昨再向報界發表聲明稱：印人急願和平解決，深望聯合國大會，能就此事有所決議。吾人早已宣布獨立，故任何協定，不論公開或秘密，若吾人並未參加談判，決不能對我產生束縛之效力。</p>
<h3>美國工業界應用　無綫電波加熱　較蒸氣加熱爲速</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞得紐約十五日電〕據華爾街雜藝最近報吿稱；戰前開始發明之利用無線電波產生熱量之方法，現時已在工廠中實際担任工作。麻省瀑布河之某大像皮工廠業巳利用無線電波之電熱，以修補巨大之硬橡皮輪，而新方法所需時間僅爲十八分鐘，而舊法利用蒸汽加熱，則需時五小時之久。另一中西部糖果製造廠，亦在利用無線電波加熱法，以製這其糖果。糖果廠可用無線電波將花生加熱至一百三十度，而同時能保存其香味。製酒商則在研究如何利用無總電波加熱法。　減裝瓶啤酒中之　　。蓋無　電波加熱法，可以透過玻璃瓶而不受阻礙也。加熱用之無線電波，與雷達廣播所用之短波相似。電波本身，並無熱力，而當電波受阻於某項物質時，電波即激動該物質之分子組織，而放出熱量，無線電波加熱工程師，頃巳預測五年之內，每年無線電波加熱設備之出售數量，將達一萬萬五千萬美金。</p>
<p>〔聯合社支加哥十五日電〕玻璃製造專家數人，在美國化工學會宣佈，發明一種含有玻璃織維之灰泥，可供製造火車車頂之用，力量較其他建築材料爲強，且不畏腐蝕。此種玻璃　維，亦可用以增強混　凝土。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統發表談話稱　太平洋若干島嶼　美當請聯合機構予以長期控制</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統昨宣稱：美國政府富視實際上之需要，而長期控制太平洋區對於國家安全具有必要之各島嶼、美國政府當請聯合國機構賦與單獨之託治權，其他非美國所願保留島嶼，當請由聯合國機構度施託治。美國當與其他盟國，對於以前不屬於日本之其他島嶼，保持相當興趣云。近自倫敦傳來報吿，謂美國出席聯合國大會之代表團，對於美國所征服之日本島嶼，是否將置於聯合國機構主權之下，意見未能一致，杜魯總統之談話，即爲解釋此事。杜總統復謂島嶼之中何者係爲美國安全所必要，尙無最後次定。余意以爲屬於安全必要範圍以內之各島，應託美國一國治理，而受聯合國安全理事會之監督</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕報紙傳稱出席聯合國大會之美國代表團，携有關於控制太平洋島嶼之草案，而權威方面亦謂美國國務院當與陸海軍官員合作，研究有關奪自日本各島之計劃。然國務院人員對於此項報紙所傳之報吿，則拒絕置評。據云拒不批評出席國際會議代表所一手處理之事件，乃國務院一貫之政策。據倫敦報吿稱：此等草案擬將重要島嶼交聯合國託治，惟必須成立諒解，將此等島嶼列入美國「軍略區域」以內。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕美衆院海軍軍事委員會小組委員會，出發考察太平洋區美軍基地，藉以決定何處應予保留。該委會一行頃抵達東京，將與陸軍司令麥克阿瑟元帥及盟軍總部各高級官員舉行會議、</p>
<h3>羅斯福夫人對記者談話</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕羅斯福總統夫人今日首次招待全體新聞記者稱，附從國社黨谷國如義大利等，一俟合格，應即許其加人聯合國機構，此項問題應由聯合國特委會決定。英前首相邱吉爾有被推爲秘書長之說，記者以此詢問夫人，答稱，予不信邱吉爾樂聞此建議。伊繼稱，此次聯合國大會中，婦女出席者甚少，未免失望，彼願見更多女代表出席，因婦女愈覺與一事之成敗有直接關係，即將愈感興趣也。</p>
<h3>美蘇兩強誠意合作　新機構必獲成就　蕯爾伐多代表致辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕聯合國機構大會今晨會議時，薩爾伐多全權大使，即該國代表團長葛萊洛致詞，其要旨爲：美國與蘇聯之參加，人類乃可希望，聯合國機構樹立永久和平必獲成立。一九二〇年時之國際聯盟則不然，蓋此兩强國俱未參加也。今晨係拉了美利堅諸國之集會，厄瓜多·阿根廷·哥倫比亞及墨西哥代表均準備向大會發表各該國之意見。葛萊來洛以溢文之法語致詞稱，一九二〇年間本人曾參加國聯第一屆大會之工作，今又出席第一屆聯合國大會，寶屬難得。經二十五載之後，善意人士在同一願望之下，再度聚首一堂，彼等於一九二〇年間之努力，不幸未獲成效。茲者重振旗鼓，再圖保持人類以免干戈浩刦，回憶一九二〇年間事，本人對於國聯首屆大會着手工作時所抱信賴與希望之精神，未能或忘，原來之約書未臻完善，實屬實情，蓋於擬具時，其原作者之一般意念，已大受改變矣。抑的書序言中，奉戴國際道德之必要原則，此固始終爲世人享受親睦生活之基礎也。初次約書欲謀各國聯合。意在保障各國之政治獨立與領土完整，其會負國均保證對國際關係，決公開以正義與光榮爲根據，嚴守國際權利原則，並尊重條約義務，重使人民安心，而保證其前途安全，豈有更勝於此之諾言乎。然諸君咸知事態之演變，罪惡力量之活動，人類之懦弱，竟未能遏制之。致約書無論在精神上或宇面上，俱未付諸實施，彼時起國際聯之命運終已決定矣。然在國際公法之範圍內大獲進展，則爲國聯之成就，其所設國際正義永久法團完成之工作，已有影響於各國之良知。今者聯合國機構向世界携來新希望，一九二〇年大會中未列席之世界最強大兩國，現均在此，凖備協力組護和平，此兩國者即美利堅半球全體人民密切歸依之症狀國，及保證國際穩固秩序必聯是也。</p>
<h3>艾森豪威爾報告　美軍復員情形</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕陸軍參度長艾森豪威爾今日出席議會非正式會議，報吿美軍復員精形稱；每名士兵獲有四十五點或服役滿三十月者，可於四月三十日退伍。獲有四十點或服役滿兩年者，可於七月一日退伍。不必要之士兵，可立即退伍，惟服役時期過短者除外。艾林豪威爾並將陸軍佔領部隊，與救火隊員相比，謂救火員時或見其嬉戲，無所事事，但並不因此撤職，將其遣送回家，因日後容有需要要甚亟之時，我國佔領軍情形亦然，務必維持於安全水準，蓋雖不能令所有之人日日有工作可做，日後容有需用之時。所稱服役滿三十月退伍一令，即至四月底可有二百二十萬人復員，其中在太平洋區城者佔五十萬人，至七月一日又有五十萬人退伍，屆時剩餘兵力總數爲一百五十萬人。但有復員過速，則軍隊組織「將趨崩潰」云。嗣由海軍軍令部長尼米茲海軍上將報吿稱：海軍復員仍依原定計劃進行。</p>
<h3>英軍同意駐日蘇軍派日否未定</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕副國務卿艾克森證實英國同意以澳洲將領一名，率領不列順共和國單隊一部，進駐日本。英軍恐須於兩三月後，始可赴日，蘇聯是否亦擬派兵駐在日本，國務院尚示獲某答覆。蘇聯政府尚未表示是否願以紅軍供麥帥指揮。</p>

<h3>幣原在普選後　仍圖維持權勢</h3>
<p>宮內省大臣石渡辭聯</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十六日廣播：據東京權威方面宣稱，不論下屆日本選舉結果如何，幣原內閣將竭盡全力，維持其權勢。幣原語人稱：其主要之任務乃在修改憲法，限制皇室之權力，但須不傷害皇室之威信。另一方面，日本社會主義派宣稱：目前形勢，對於成立人民陣綫，極爲有利，日本社會主義黨與共產黨重要份子，決定於日內召開會議，討論重大問題。</p>

<h3>羅馬變了乞丐城　赤貧難民估計在十五萬人之譜　盟軍行後氣兒琴樂亦銷聲絕跡</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十五日電〕羅馬向來有「不朽城」之稱，就連行乞的藝術，也和別處不同，總帶着一些音樂的氣息。但是現在情勢改變了，不再聽到樂聲，只看見乞丐的本相，襤被骯體，爛瘡惡疾，伸着手向人要錢。據市政府統計，全市乞丐共的二萬人，有許多是以求乞爲職集的，赤貧的人估計在十五萬人之譜。幾個月前，乞丐羣中還雜有幾百個來自山問的笛手和許多衣衫襤的男女兒童，奏弄手風琴。這聯合國佔領軍初到羅馬的時候，是行乞的絕好法門，隨時有英美士兵把里拉票慷慨施捨。現在大隊士兵開走了，乞兒的樂聲，也跟着消逝。留在羅馬的少數士兵，日日看見伸着的手掌，心　也變硬了。幾個月前一個乞丐，每天賺　百個星拉不算希奇，有時候，竟可以一天有一千里拉的收入，現在就賺不到這許多了。有一個老婦衣着尙好，樣子像窮途落魄的貴族，依舊只在第五大街上行乞。半年前，她向施主講法認，現在改用義大利話，但城市裏大部份的乞丐，如囚首垢面的婦女，牽着病容滿面的小孩子，却不絕在羅馬的街道上，往來行乞。因爲天氣太冷，不復能枯坐幾個鐘頭不動那些慣裝默默含悲亟需救濟的乞丐，已大部分離棄了他們的崗位，對外國人，他們大多說義大利話：「老爺，請給我們一些東西罷。」但是，最有效果的說法，要算一個木立着的老頭子，只喊着「餓煞了，餓煞了！」</p>
<h3>美蘇代表在漢城商朝問題鮮　託治時期將縮短</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城十六日電〕美蘇兩國遵照莫斯科三強外長會議協定，在漢城舉行聯合員會議。蘇聯代表團七十三人，今日在大雪紛飛中由朝鮮北部佔領區乘火車抵此，將與美代表團共謀復興朝鮮，使四十年來受日本統治甫經解放之三千萬韓人，恢復獨立。美國安諾德少將親至漢城車站歡迎，即偕蘇聯代表施蒂柯夫中將等，問赴朝鮮飯店。南部佔領區美軍司令霍奇中將，旋即驅事往訪。午後由雙方軍官先行協商，訂定議程。明日兩國領袖將在日本統治朝鮮之總督府舉行會議，據霍奇中將稱：因蘇聯代表提議，會議消息將以聯合公報發佈。兩國佔領區以緯度三十八度爲界，因此人工劃分，其經濟問題倍增重要。雙方皆備有專門顧問,陣容整齊。就大體言，朝鮮北部爲工業區，南部爲農業區。按照莫斯科會議決定，當以恢復韓國經濟基礎爲第一要着，然後再議政治問題。　〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕此間官方各界人士，對國務院宜佈朝鮮美蘇佔領軍司令不久即將會晤一點，表示歡迎。認爲此係消減朝鮮境內界限之佳兆，一般人士對於美蘇第一次正式會議，將使莫斯科會義中所規定之聯合委員會早日成立，以及儘早調整南北兩區行政經濟事務之可能性，頗抱樂觀。接近國務院之人士稱：目下有充分理由，可信莫斯科公報中規定聯合國託治朝鮮五年，計劃其期限可能相當縮短。</p>

<h3>謙讓融洽愉悅圓滿　東方式大集議　第二次協商會速寫</h3>
<p>— 本報重慶十三日航訊　濮德不合時宜寄</p>
<p>政治協商會議的第二次會議，於十二日上午九時在國府禮堂繼續舉行。張瀾因病缺席，王雪艇因事遲到，出席的一共三十五位，仍由孫哲生院長代理主席。</p>
<p>會議開始：在和煦的冬天陽光下，空氣異常融洽，首先按照昨天決定的議程，由政府與共黨雙方報吿雙十會談紀要的來歷。</p>
<p>邵力子謙讓可風</p>
<p>邵力子先生謙和的讓周恩來先生先開始，禮讓的氛圍使今天的會議從頭到尾保持着諧和的作風。</p>
<p>記者坐在旁聽席上，也消失了昨日會議後半的提心吊膽的不安。</p>
<p>周恩來娓娓動聽</p>
<p>周恩來首光客氣兩句，謝謝秘書處的讓他先說話。隨後就娓娓不絕的，把兩方八年來的會談交涉的經過歷歷數出。他着生於「八年前是爲了停止內戰團結抗戰，如今是爲了停止內戰，和平建國。「周恩來先生誠摯的聲調態度，博得了全塲的好評。他自然的使人們忘記了一些不愉快的事實，使這個融洽的氛團能一慣保持下去。</p>
<p>共產黨的安全感</p>
<p>接着，邵力子加以補充，他强調雙方商談的誠意，但也提示了過去也曾有過雙方各持立塲，致使會議幾度中斷的事實。他發表了一次會談紀要曾抹掉了的商談，因爲這一次——停止衝突是由於共黨的「安全感」而不曾取得協議。這也　是雙十以後衝突　續存在而擴人的唯一理山。邵先生還客氣的說這次的會談，應歸功於現在忙着另一件商談的張文白先生，他曾出了最大的力，有着最好的成就。</p>
<p>孫哲生宣佈休息</p>
<p>雙方報吿完了，主席宣佈休息十五分鐘。一時休息空中，爐火傍邊，又堆滿了隨意談話和笑聲。希特勒之流決不會相信這是在一個會議麈旁邊，尤其是在國府裏衆行。</p>
<p>王雲五步入別室</p>
<p>這時，王雲五·陳立夫·陳啓天·　必武·梁漱溟等一行五人，入別室協商軍事調查閱的人選。</p>
<p>休息過後，（通過接受張羣和周恩來關於停止軍事衝突及恢復交通的商談經赤報吿）邵從恩，余家菊，又相繼發言，稱：商談一直在進步的狀態中舉行，頗堪欣慰。這時，行將赴平參加執行三人團的協商結果的葉劍英氏，向大家辭行．</p>
<p>鄧穎起不忘女權</p>
<p>鄧　超復發言稱：年事調查團的代。表應有女性參加。這時，大家以無正事討論，談笑風生。最後，王雲五先生等一行五人，重行入塲，主席從王氏手中接過名單後，就提交會議，徵求意見，結果全體一致同意，會讓就愉快而圓滿的結束了。</p>
<p>這三小時的第二次會議，的確令人衷心喜悅，假如昨日的會議是西方式的，今天的會議便可以說是道地的東方式的，中國畢竟是禮讓之邦會。</p>
<h3>爲復興中國而效勞的美將軍　陳納德在重慶　將作長管飛行視察我國商務運輸情況</h3>
<p>〔本報編譯室稿〕記者很榮幸的，得在蘭達爾少將寓邸，於十五日下竿，厠身記者招待會中覩見了滿臉沉毅而富於青年氣魄的陳納德中將。陳納德此次是再度來華，所又可說是舊地重遊，其情緒倍呈親切熱烈，使記者們也跟他很合得來了。</p>
<p>我們在陳納德中將身邊一坐下來，便開始提出了記者們心坎里所懷思的問題，主要的有兩點：一是關於美國在太平洋上的商業航空事業將有怎樣的新發展，一是關于於他們個人在華的的工作計劃如何。</p>
<p>關於第一項問題，陳納德告訴記者們說：「美國的飛機製造一天比一天新穎，比B29型飛機速率增兩倍又上的飛機，就我所知道，是已經創造成功了。」</p>
<p>飛行時間將縮短</p>
<p>「二星期前，我飛渡太平洋，所費時間，才只有五十六小時呢！」言下不勝愉快，同時更裝着非常輕快的姿態，像是在高空中重享此種樂趣似的。</p>
<p>據他看來，美國方面已決定今年年內，至遲在年底，橫渡太平洋的飛行時間，一定會縮短到可驚的程度，那時，必定將因爲採用一種已經試騐成功了的高速度飛機，而减縮到三十六小時吧。</p>
<p>他又作着預測似的說：（並且堅信地說）三月底，汛美航空公司即將恢復橫渡太平洋上的商業朮行；他又說；其他航空公司，也有舉辦同樣航綫的消息，這是可能在六月底光景付諸實施的了</p>
<p>陳納德中將，對中國事情具有豐厚的感興。他除了表白他訪華的工作意志而外，更提到目前正在進行中的政協會議等各方面的具體見解，這在美國新聞處的報道中可以看出，記出落得省一點筆墨。他那天所述的大意如此：「我此次來華訪問，係由於個人調查中國商業與運輸情况的願望所慫恿」。</p>
<p>陳納德中將，繼即强調他的重來中國，「確係一項私人事務」，而與中美政府絕無官方聯系，而他的興趣，亦僅在調查中國全部，要看一看在中國復興工作中，他個人是否尙能有效勞之處。因爲這八年來，他的工作都是屬於破壞方面的。</p>
<p>爲期預計三個月　「我此次來華，並非代表任何美國公司組織，但等到我完成我的調查工作以後，或者可以有助於若干美國企業組織了。」他預料此項調查工作範圍，將包括商業上的可能發展，目前的商業情形與航空運輸情形，所需時間，的爲三個月。</p>
<p>他決意將考察北平以南之中國谷地，目前尙無前往華北或東三省之意。不過，如有機會，他倒頗想在三月間考察北方。</p>
<p>陳納德中將，自去年十月三十一日以後，即已在陸軍中退休，目前仍穿陸軍航空隊制服。當他離華返美之際，距第一枚原子彈　落於廣島，僅有兩日。他說：那時，十四航空隊，已經完成在中國方面的任務。</p>
<p>陳納德中將，接着便論及目前的運輸問題，農業經濟之急待發展，以及公路河流所受的破壞。他說：欲求解決各項問題，尙需相當的時問。且此項工作非常艱巨，他爲了希望有助於中國起見，認爲與其肩負軍事責任，寗願担任平時任務。至於他未來的計劇，全視他對於和平時期中國貿易悄形之考察結果如何以爲斷。</p>
<p>對協商會議認係統一好契機</p>
<p>現在，他正在重慶與其軍事商業界友人相晤。他一到重慶，當天即曾與蔣委員長共餐，他說：蔣氏是他的一個私人朋友。又說：「我們未曾談論公務，我深以委座之愉快而愉快。我對於他目前完成統一中國的工作，表示賀意！」</p>
<p>接着，陳納中將，又發表其個人的見解。他以爲目前的政治協商會議，「實爲達成統一之正確道路中的良好契機。中國必需，纔能擔當世界强國的任務</p>
<p>他又說到美國人民「對於中國，甚爲關切，惟對於中國情勢還缺乏充分的了解。」</p>
<p>陳納德中將預定後天（十八日）赴昆明，再返重慶，然後首途出發，作考察各地情勢之旅行。那時他將偕譯員一人，陪同前往。現在，美國空運大隊，中國空軍運輸大隊，及中國航空公司，均已表示願以飛機供其旅行。</p>
<p>美陸戰隊兵士參觀中國舞台美軍開抵華北後，我國爲表示歡迎起見，在北平舞台連續演劇數天，答酬開抵故都接收日軍設備，繳除日軍武裝及遣送日軍回國之美國海軍陸戰隊。國示：美海軍陸戰隊兵士進人後台參觀中國演平劇伶人化裝之情形。</p>
<h3>廿五年後「大熊」將舉世無敵？蘇聯實力新預測</h3>
<p>— 原文載美國常識雜誌　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>在幾百架計算機的營營聲中，蘇聯的未來的賞力被估計着而加算出來。據最精密的人口估計所表示，在廿五年以後，就人口方面而論，蘇聯的實力，將勝過歐洲任何政治上的集團國家。</p>
<p>槍砲和軍火雖然各國都有，可是現代戰爭的勝敗，是由大量軍隊決定的。當財力物力耗竭的時候，擁有最多數人口的國家，就佔有絕大的優勢。關於這一點，蘇聯知道得最詳盡。蘇聯在這次大戰中所受的損失，比較歐洲其他任何國家爲鉅大，可是它依然能以第一線的單隊和敵人周旋到底。　蘇聯將在下一世代中以非常的速度，繼續增加人口，而歐洲其他各國的人口，將保持停滯狀熊。目前歐洲西部和北部的人口，在减退中，預料此項减退將繼續下去。即使在戰前該處的人口，亦無增殖的迹象。各國人口减少的平均率，計丹麥，芬蘭，匃牙利，蘇格蘭爲百分之十，比利時，捷克斯拉夫，法國，拉脫維亞，挪威和瑞士自百分之十至二十，瑞典，英國，希特勒執政以前的德國，奧國，爲百分之二十强。</p>
<p>廿五年後蘇聯人中增至二萬萬五千萬</p>
<p>據戴高樂政府最近報吿：法國人口如依目前速度繼續减少，則至本世紀末，人口將由目前的四千萬减至二千五百萬。據人口專家臆測：五十年後，法國的人口將减少七八百萬。</p>
<p>除蘇聯不計外，就整個歐洲而諭，前途較爲光明。撇開戰爭的影響不談，到一九七〇年，歐洲人口應增加一千八百萬，抱旬話說，一九四〇年的人口總數，爲三萬萬九千九百萬，至一九七〇年將增至四萬萬一千七百萬。但這些人口的增加，差不多祗有羅馬尼亞，保加利亞和南斯拉夫等國，纔有這現象。</p>
<p>人口的趨勢是否能被政策所改樊，這是必須提出的一個問題。納粹黨雖用獎品借款和所謂愛國熱忱獎勵生育，然於提高德國的生育率並沒得到成功。凡是不願把女性關在家庭襄專負生育之責的國家，在這方面所遭遇的困難，恐怕更爲重大。</p>
<p>蘇聯的人口和歐洲其他部份比較起來，顯然有直綫上升之勢，而且顯示着繼長增高的徵象。從一九〇〇年以來，蘇聯人口已增加百分之五十五，這數字包括第一次世界大戰和共產革命所損失的二千六百萬人在內。據統計學家估計：蘇聯的戰事損失雖甚鉅大，但蘇聯的人口將自一九四〇年的一萬萬七千四百萬人增加到一九七〇年的二萬萬五千一百萬之譜。單單這增加出來的數目將大於二十五年後德國的全人口。到那時期，蘇聯的人口將較歐洲西部及北部的全人口，多出二千六百萬人！</p>
<p>在估計國家的實力方面，人口的數量是以軍隊的師團數目來測度的，而不是以全國人口的總數計算的。老年人和女子雖然臨到最後階段，可驅使他們加入戰鬥的部門，然而決定戰爭勝敗的因素，是自十五歲至三十四歲的少壯的青年，這一點，任何軍事領袖都一致承認的。所以在估算下一代歐洲各國的實力時，人口的年齡亦須加以考慮。</p>
<p>蘇聯青年人口數量等於英法德義總額</p>
<p>在道方面，我們發見蘇聯仍居於首要的地位。自一九〇〇年以後，蘇聯繼續以六百萬入伍年齡的靑年補充紅軍的險伍，而德國所增補的靑年軍人祇有廿萬人。這就是說，蘇聯增加了四百師的軍隊，而德國祇增加了十二師。今後蘇聯的軍事年齡的人力，將益形增厚。據普林斯登大學人口專家寇克氏估計：到一九七〇年，蘇聯的軍事年齡的靑年，將增加一千三百萬人，單單這一項坩加的數目，已經較德國在一九三七年疆域以內所有的全部靑年軍隊爲大了。寇氏又預言謂：「在一九七〇年，蘇聯所有的十五歲至三十四歲的靑年，其數等於英·法·德·義·波·西班牙及羅馬尼亞谷國所有同樣靑年的總和，這些國家都是歐洲人口最稠密的國家。」</p>
<p>即使把蘇聯的戰事損失計算在內，也不致使那景象有多大的變動，因爲在歐洲其他部份，戰事損失也差不多同樣重大的。若干軍事專家曾經斷定戰爭趨於機械化以後，人口的差額比較不甚重要。裝備充足的少數人，足以匹敵武備不全的多數人。經過此次戰爭以後，這些理論便不能再成立了。人們果然不能以徒手攻擊俎克車和飛機，但是只要有最低限度的技術進步，多數的人口是會顯示它的力量的。能够無限制供給的人口，可以補軍備方面貧乏的不足。</p>
<p>蘇聯在這次大戰中，工藝學方面突飛猛進。再過二十五年以後，蘇聯在軍備方面的充實，無疑的，足與世界任何國家並駕齊驅。觀於蘇聯最近宣佈在今後數年內全國靑年將受廣泛的强迫軍事訓練一事，益可佩帶徵信。</p>
<p>人口的增減，與技術的進步似有密切的關係。當機械工程輸入後，人口隨之增加。道大半由於衛生改進，醫學進步，而致死亡率降低之故。</p>
<p>如果蘇聯循着過去數百年的人口型式進行，要經過長久的時期繞會達到人口開始减少的地步到那時，蘇聯的人口可能與歐洲其餘部份的全人口相等，或甚至較多。</p>
<p>未來各國國勢強弱繋於工業化之程度</p>
<p>然而，我們須知蘇聯同時也和人口稠密的亞洲接壞，要是不把這一事實記在心頭，我們不能考慮與歐洲有關的蘇聯人口而得到全部的概念。</p>
<p>在東方各國，如果專家的估計不錯的話，我們將見到若十顯著的人口增加，足使影響整個世界的實力的均勢。這一區械，除日本以外，比較地沒有受着西方工業革命的影響。印度在英國統治下已稍稍趨向工業化，而反映於人口的增加。但是，現在東方各國，似已準備接受西方的機械文一明，而且爲期不遠，屆時人口的增進，恐將打破人類歷史上的紀錄。即就印度過去四十年中的進展以觀，也就可以想像到它未來的發展了。印度在過去四十年中，人口自二萬萬八千四百萬增加到目前的三萬萬八千八百萬，日本的進步表現於短期的工業化及隨之發生的人品的增加。一八七〇年日本人口的計三千五百萬人，至一九四〇年，此數已倍增，最後一次的人口調查，顯示了七千五百十萬的人口。戰事發生以後，此種迅速蝗人口增加，並無停止的徵象。</p>
<p>再就亞洲大陸而論，依據過去十年中人口生長的情形加以估計，中國人口將由目前的四萬萬人增加到一九九〇年的六萬萬零九百萬人。在同時期內，印度的人口將自三萬萬八千八百萬人增至七萬萬零一百萬人，這些數宇是可驚的，但都是以過去的人口生長率爲依據的。要是亞洲能圓滿地實行工業化，那麼人口的增加率或許更爲大些。如果中國和印度的人口跟日本增加得同樣快，一那麼在五十年以後，中國及亞洲東南部的人口可能等於目前全世界的總人口。</p>
<p>我們即使以過去人口增加率作爲根據而加以估計，到一九九〇年，蘇聯的人口增至三萬萬二千八百萬時，中國及東南亞的人口便有十六萬萬七千八百萬，這就是說，五十年以後，蘇聯的人品將被東方各國所超出，其比率爲五與一之比，不過，這　人口增加的預測，是以東方各國工業化爲前提的。至其國力的强弱，則須視工業化的程度以爲決定。但有一點可又確定的，即歐局一且穩定以后，蘇聯的視綫將轉移到東方來。就人口估計的結果以觀，那是不可避免的。但有一點可以確定的，即局一旦穩定以後，蘇聯的視綫將轉移到東方來。就人口估計的結果以觀，那是不可避免的。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>外國人論中國事</h3>
<p>外國人論中國事，有時非常警國，但有時究未免感到隔膜。紐的泰晤士報近刊載英人懷德爵士一文，題曰「從東方來的對西方的挑戰」。共中論到中國局勢稱。：「我主張假如聯合國，特別是美國，能够同意畝中國人民依照中國人民所特有的途徑來自已決定他們的政府，中國必將更快而有效地獲致它自己的結論，——即使其間要償付一些流血的代價。」懷德爵十叉稱：同樣的這則應行用於今日的整個亞洲，包括印度在內。」懊德爵士的原文，我們迄未獲見；但路透社却摘錄了這兩點，佈各地，彷彿中國人此時也正想和美國「挑戰」一樣，豈非奇事！對于懷德爵士的關心中國，我們原應感謝，但對於他的論調，似覺得確有商計的必要。</p>
<p>懷德爵士的論調，據他自己說是基於亞洲人的觀點；他似乎替亞洲人，包括中國人在內，說出了他們所要說的話。可是就中國的局勢而論，懷德爵士的論調，旨在暗美軍早日撤離中國，這與美國的國策頗有出入。此項言論之散布於美國，意欲影響美國輿論，從而對其國策予以修正：一旦如願，不特關係美國的國策，抑且影饗到遠東局勢的推移。懷德爵士爲英人，而掛起從「亞洲人眼光」下論列到亞洲問題，特別是「中國人眼光」下論到中國局勢幌子，以圖增强他立論的力量，則我們中國人，特別是當他論到中國局勢的時候，自應表明我們的態度。</p>
<p>首先我們要指出的：中國人民在抗戰勝利以後，明瞭美國軍隊在中國的任務，及美國政府對華的政策，並不曾有美軍早日撤離中國的要求和希望。美國的軍隊，在中國以盟邦之誼，協助着中國政府在中國戰區執行受降及遺歸日僑日俘的任務。美國軍隊之在中國負起這一種任務，一方面固在協助中國，可是在另一方面也在執行着與他們本身利益有關的任務。至少在現階段，在這個任務不曾達成之前，中國人民並沒有希望美國軍隊撤離中國的要求。</p>
<p>第二，美國大總統一冉聲明美國的對華政策不是在干涉內政，乃是在扶持中國建立一個强固統一而民主的國家。最近杜魯門總統的聲明又重申了美國對華的傳統國策。赫爾利將軍及馬歇爾元帥的努力，一面固在執行美國政策，而在中國人民則認爲是一個民主先進的國家以鄰邦之誼來抉助中國建立一個强固統一而民主的國家。對於這種盛意，我們有的是感奮而不是怨恨，更談不上有美軍早日撤離中國的要求。</p>
<p>上列兩點是中國人民的眞誠感覺。但我們不否認另一宗事實，即自日寇投降以來，因爲美國軍隊迅速地到達了中國的海岸各大港口，並協助着國民政府担任起受降的任務，或許妨碍了若干擁有武力的政團企圖從日寇那裏擴張他們勢力的計劃，因而製造民意要求美軍撒離中國，倘其計得售，旣沒有美國軍隊可以看見他們的行動，他們便可爲所欲爲。甚至如此次協議停止衝突以後，依然背約襲擊，依然攻城奪地，也可不致再爲盟友所證實。其實，中國人民眞誠的願望，在此時惟有秩序安定爲最重要，听以他們不願意看見有政治上紛爭。美國在中國的努力，既不牽涉到內政的干涉，實具有一種安定影響，是頗得讚許的。我們記得在抗戰初期，這些份子早已鼓吹中國不應親近美國，共後因國際局勢轉變，乃提出「民主」的口號，希望取得美國的支持：目前則因美國公正而計不得售，又復轉而發爲排美之論，提出美軍撒離中國的要求。凡此，皆爲一種中國一部分人士政治上的陰謀。懷德爵士倘就此等人的論調而認爲中國人民一般的意向，因據以發爲論著，太近於隔靴搔癢了。</p>
<p>即就世界和平的立塲來說，倘使美國不預聞中國事件，亦將引起極可慮的後果。這就使從英國人的立塲來說，對於英國自身的利益從一個較遠的角度着眼，也不是有利的。第二次世界大戰，導源於九一八的瀋陽事件，史汀遜的主張不曾得到西鬥的支持，終至在中國東北一角的星星之火，弄得不可收拾。這是英國政策的錯誤。今日，在軸心崩潰後的今日，盱衡國際的局勢，實不容再有錯誤牽動全局。人類應該從遠大處着眼，不可囿於目前的事態，致貽將來的禍息。我們試想一想，今天的亞洲，從土耳其，伊朗，一直以至東亞，含蓄着幾多未爆炸的火藥。伊朗的局勢已經很嚴重了，土耳其也遭到威脅。我們不能讓這種局勢蔓延開去。中國値長期抗戰之後，已步入建國的階段，需要建國理想相同的民主國家的協助，美國爲了支持它在遠東的國策，不惜犧牲了無量數人的生命。現在戰爭雖已停止，國際秩序猶待軍建。在我們建國的努力上，盟邦善意的扶助，这種功跡，將永留在中國人民的心版。在重建國際秩序的努力上，盟邦允須一德一心，捐棄私見，共圖進展。在這樣一個原子能的時代，國家的利益，應遠不如世界的利益，人類的利益。某些言行，在單純一個國家的觀點，或在民族利益的觀點下，也許是有利的；但在一個世界的眼光下，也許是有害的。這不僅像懷德爵士那些論調應該愼重，就是中國人自己發言也當應前瞻後，不可局限於一時一地的見解。</p>

<h3>市商會電請財部　修正營業稅法</h3>
<p>上海市商會，爲請修正營業稅法第五條，及同法施行細則第九條第十三條，昨電財政部云：</p>
<p>免稅標凖請予變更　「重慶財政市營業稅，頃已改由財政部上海直接稅局接管，依據公告，自上年十月二十一日起徵。惟查營業稅法第五條所定之免徵營業稅標準，其第二項爲「以營業資本額爲課徵標準，其營業資本額不滿二千元者，」當時立法主旨，原爲體恤小資本之商店起見，惟近數年來幣値變遷至劇，較立法當時殆爲一與千之比例，按照今昔比例，從前千百元之商店，現在非百數十萬元不辦，若照法定免稅標準辦理，則雖有免微之名，並無免徵之實，應請鈞部參照今昔情形，予以變更規定，籍期適合現實。</p>
<p>資本定義劃一標凖　又營業稅法施行細則第營業資本額，依其原投入資本或實收股本，加公積準備，及未提取或未分配之盈餘計算，」不問其是否參加營業運用，而所得稅法施行細則第九條，又稱「甲乙兩項營利事業有公積金者，得以三之一併入資本計算，但以已參加營業運用者爲限，」是營業稅之資本，應將公積全部併算，而所得稅則祇許以三分之一併算，同爲國家徵收之直接稅，而對於資本之定義，竟有上述矛盾之規定，似欠允當，併請改從劃一標準，俾商民有所遵循，實爲公便，上海市商會叩寒，</p>
<p>製造業稅亦請修正　該會又爲制造業營業稅請按資本額課征事，昨亦電財政部請予修正。</p>

<h3>上海日人資產那里去了？</h3>
<p>— 李伯曼（H．R．Lieberman）著　原載十一月三十一日紐的時報</p>
<p>自從日本投降之後，日本在上海的許多資產，跟同德國資產，都不見了。這些產由人盜賣，變爲金條·美鈔·外匯，和別的形式。新的資產持有者都是化名的中國人，葡萄牙人，和白俄。另外還有許多資產是被隱藏起來了。　至於移轉的和隱藏的資產共値若干？簡直是無法佔計。這是因爲很難追查原委，而且許多證件是被毀壞了，或者被改換了。根據官方報告，在被毀的證件中至少牽涉一個銀行，這個銀行是日本海軍和陸軍底受託銀行。</p>
<p>秘密報告收效　上海區敵僞產業處理局是在十月尾成立的。該局已經鼓勵大家秘密地報告關於敵僞資產的文卷，不動產，以及動產中的車。船。機器·食物·金·銀·證劵，和傢具等等的各種情形。凡因報告而發現敵僞資產的，該局並給以重賞，總値達中國法幣一百萬元的，賞百分之二十；總値在一千萬元以下的，賞百分之十五；總値在一萬萬元以下的，賞百分之十；總値超過一萬萬元的，賞百分之五。據該局盧秘書說；這樣的辦法收到很大的效果。　在十月下半月，該局收到五百件秘密報告，因之而發現的有：棉花五萬包，肥皂四萬五千箱，金屬四千噸，械器五百件，磁器一千二百箱，此外，還有五個工廠，連民大批報紙·布·米·麥·麵粉·酒精等·其他的小物件還不算在內·</p>
<p>有一天，一個德國人來上到海區敵僞產業處理局，自動地報告，說他有一個工廠被中國人非法地侵佔了。處理局於是派人去調查，果然有所發現·</p>
<p>是人有所提防　自從日本投降起一直到中國官吏來上海有力地執行職務爲止，中間是一個月之久；在這一側月內，許多敵僞資產已經被毀壞了。日本商人運走了他們底資產，如棉花·絲·機器等等，連同原來正在運往上海途中的貨物，一併交給中立國人保管。貨倉未運走的貨物以及地產，主權都轉讓給中闕人，葡萄牙人，和白俄。其中還有日本人所友好的咖啡店女郞。</p>
<p>工廠和住宅裏的東西都是被人搬走變賣了。日本人變賣產資時還說那不是日本人的。有一家印刷廠，是以善價出賣的，是賣給一個主顧，但是在記錄上說是分別賣給好幾個主顧；可見日本人也是有所提防。</p>
<p>又金條作交易　這一切交易都是以金條（十兩的）計算。那時約値美鈔六百元。日本人拿到這些金條，一部份交給認爲非常可靠的人埋藏起米，一部份已運出中國。　據銀行家估計，到戰爭結束時爲止，日本人從滿洲和朝鮮運到上海的黃金（爲的是作戰需要，）連同原有的，已達戰前的五借至八倍之多。</p>
<p>交易所得有的是美國鈔票，但價値不及金條之多。日本人還買走了白金；因爲鑽石不大吃香，所以未買。</p>
<p>日本人還得到不少的瑞士的法郞，和瑞典的克郞納，用的是中國人名義，以避免注意。</p>
<p>定要物歸原主　轉賣不動產，按理說，是可以查出來，因爲戰前的主人回來之後，可以用文件來證明那是他底產業。可是，日本人成立了若干產僞的地產公司，把不動產數次轉手之後，呌人無法追查，找不到眞正的負責人。轉手的證件有的是被撕掉了，或者是被塗改了。敵僞產業處理局聲明要物歸原主，不問中間經過如何。</p>
<p>日本人還賄賂中國官吏，設法保存他們底產業。這種不肖的官吏已被蔣委員長申斥，而換以比較廉潔的人。</p>

<p>文學</p>
<h3>文學與麵包</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>記不淸那年了，大的總在六七年以前，我看到一本美闕出版的雜誌上，刋載過一篇「文學與麵包」的文章。初看了那題目，以爲裏面所說的一定是關於文人生活的問題。文人的際遇，無分中外，總是坎坷困厄的多。文人爲了吃飯，便不得不埋頭寫作，盡其最大努力日夜創作。苦思竭慮的結果，又僅僅只能換得極少量的生活資源。中國人所謂「著書都爲稻粱謀」，爲的是幾斗米。貧困的西洋作家，寫稿亦無非換取麵包，同樣爲的是吃飯。直覺的體會，那篇文章大的總是說的這些話。</p>
<p>仔細看過一遍，却並不如此。那篇文章以機警生動的文筆，叙說文學作品創作的過程，和烘製麵包的程序與方法如出一轍。作者根據紐的著名的麵包廠製造麵包的程序與方法，把牠拿來和文學作品的寫作技巧做譬比。結論是文學作品的創造，雖屬藝術，同樣也是技術。我看完了那篇「文學與麵包」，感到特別新鮮，饒有趣味。至今想想，仍舊覺得牠是一篇極有意義的文章。可惜刋載那篇文章的雜誌，早已散失不能再找着了，只有让牠在糢糊的記憶中留一些糢糊的印象。</p>
<p>我想文學作品本身，就是一只麵包。任何一種文學作品，牠的材料總是有限的，即如一篇小說，或一齣戯劇，縱人物很多，故事很曲折，然而構成那小說或戯劇的中心思想總不出一個。這就是說，每一篇小說或戯劇，總有牠的「主題」。一篇文學作品，　不出主題的線索，看不到「高潮」，一定不是成功的作品。</p>
<p>所以文學作品的材料大抵是很單純的，往往一個日常生活的斷片，一件偶然發現的事實，一些不被人注意的小事，到了作者的手裏，可以把牠加以渲染，而成爲一篇小說，乃至數百頁的一個長篇，這眞像製造麵包的一點小小的麵粉，可經「發酵作用」而成爲大大的一只麵包。構成文學作品的一些材料，正好比一點小小的麵粉，也需要經過作者的精巧的手法，使之發生文學的「發酵作用」而成爲一篇完美的作品。文學寫作技巧上的烘托，渲染，提煉，都和烘製麵包時所需要的種種方法相似。製造麵包時應用那塊麵條而使之「發酵」，其間需要適當的技術，火力的大小也很有關係，過火便焦了，不到火力又不行，這全在製麵包的人善於運用其技術。文學作者如何去處置他旣定的題材，如何穿挿一個小情節，如何發展主題，如何顯示高潮，如何激起讀者的「移情作用」，在在都需要作者運用他的手法。要做到「爐火純靑」，功力成熟，和製造優良的麵包似乎也有相似意義之處。雖然，一般地說，無論一只麵包怎樣難製，總要比寫一篇成熟的文學作品容易得多。</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>新萬能藥</h3>
<p>— 左右</p>
<p>不久的將來，世界上將有一種最新的藥品出現。它能够醫治配尼西林所沒法治愈的疾病，它是各種疑難疾病的良藥，它是傷寒，虎疫，外科瘡毒等等的對頭，它也許還能醫治師癆，它的名字，呌做Streptmycin。</p>
<p>發明這東西的人是一位美國的微菌生理學家，名呌威克門。他知道泥土裘面有若干微生虫，能够殺死傷寒，痢疾與虎疫等疾病的病菌，便用泥土和入水中，再把這泥水酒在一塊培養着病菌的玻璃片上。他就研究玻璃片上的病菌是否被殺死，再設法找出殺害這些病菌的兇手。可是這些兇手却厲害非儿，非但力能殺死動物，且能傷害人類的生命，有的竟能於數秒鐘內，致人死命。威克門當然無法利用它去製造藥品，所以起初毫無成就。</p>
<p>可是在一九四三年，成氏和他的助手却找到了一種呌做Actinomyces　griseus的微生虫。它能殺死許多病菌，威氏就把含有這種微生虫的液體加以提煉，便呌它作Streptomyln。</p>
<p>但威氏旣無製藥經驗，又乏製藥的設備，便請一家藥廠協助他工作，他先要知道這東西用之於動物身上是否有害，試驗結果頗爲美滿，鼠類身上用了大量的Streptomycin後，也毫無不良的反應，於是藥廠方面馬上動員了五十名專家，研究這種新穎的藥品。</p>
<p>他們先把它來試驗腸炎菌。在實驗室中，腸炎菌遇見了這藥品，便毫無抵抗地潰滅了。於是他們把它拿到醫院中去試驗，病人使用這藥品後，二十四小時內，病體已霍然而愈。</p>
<p>他們再利用它來醫治傷寒。一個患傷寒症已達三星期的痛苦病人，服用這藥品後，便很怏地復原了。其他病人服用了它，也有同樣的結果。</p>
<p>這些消息散佈開來了，許多醫生都密切地加以注意。他們把這藥品施用於各種病人身上，如痢疾，虎疫，瘡毒等等，無不獲得奇効。</p>
<p>但這藥品是否能够醫治肺癆呢？</p>
<p>若干研究士把它施用於染有肺病的動物身上竟然把牠們治愈了。這藥品雖能治愈染有肺病的動物，但是否能够醫治肺癆病人，目前尚不能確定。</p>
<p>不過我們知道這藥品與配尼西林，正如牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。凡是配尼西林所不能治的疾病，它都能醫治。因爲配尼西林是一種酸性藥品，而它却是一種籃基藥品。這兩種藥劑，可能配合在一起，製成一種萬能奇藥，足以對付差不多一切的疾病哩。</p>
<p>出版</p>
<h3>表揚忠貞</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>幾個月來，書報攤上發現了許多關於揭發大小漢好陰私的「醜史」「秘史」之類的刊物，五花八門，不可勝計。對於檢舉這批奸逆過去的罪惡，藉可提供司法機關審辦時的參考資料，自然値得贊許，不過那些編者爲了迎合一般低級讀者的心理，其中不乏着重於「玩女人」的色情故事，而且詞句上描摹得淋漓盡致，就跡近「誨淫，」而有失本意了。</p>
<p>漢奸的罪惡固然揭發了，但是抗戰八年中那些忠貞之士爲國殉難的壯烈事蹟，又爲什麼不替他們表揚一番呢？淪陷區域幅員之廣，常時眞不知有多少烈士被敵僞摧殘戕害，其中驚犬地泣鬼神。可歌可泣，悲壯曲折的故事，豈在少數？倘能搜集編成刊物，又何嘗不能吸引讀者，工作上雖然吃力一些，其價値却遠在這些「醜史」「秘史」之上了。這樣不但可以使千萬沉寃地下的烈士的忠貞事蹟永垂千古不朽，天下人讀此，亦可有所警愓於來茲，同時政府則可根據此項史料去向敵人算淸這筆血債，如此說來，編製忠貞史蹟刊物的任務豈能加以忽視，希出版界注意及之。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>陳逆借鏡</h3>
<p>— 談自由</p>
<p>報載陳逆公博在土牢里曾一度索鏡一看，守者答之日：何必照鏡。</p>
<p>眞的，坐在牢里的陳逆，又不會有什麼人會「晉見」他，又沒有「友邦」日本通知他去開「大東亞會議」，照鏡作什？但是，他畢竟曾要借過的。我爲了空暇沒事做，代他左右地想了好一會，才想出一個相當可靠的道理業－然衹是我想出來的。</p>
<p>陳逆在土牢裏空着荒，一點事亦沒有，寫回憶錄作詩之類固然提不起精神來，看報亦寡興趣，中國的一批奸細雖還沒大量受審，究竟什麼賴伐爾，貝當，戈林，東條…給他心煩。這天晚上，大槪就是借鏡前一天，他睡在舖上，翻來覆去，忽然睡不去，本來「夜在牢獄分外長」的，忽然想起自已底事來。他想：自從我從日本僕僕塵地起解來此，已有了幾個月，日不見太陽，夜沒有電燈，都還罷了，祇是自己底命運如何？官方對我底罪狀偵查得究竟如何？最后會不會殺頭。問牢卒又不敢，苦思又不得。忽然想到中國的國貨－看相學，雖然自已沒有學過，但「氣色」之類大概都可看出點，雖未必可靠，亦聊可以自解，於是乎，才有借鏡之舉。</p>
<p>假使我猜得不錯，我寄語那位守者，下次陳逆如果再要借鏡子，那末，請你借給他，給他看個淸楚。而你在旁要仔細看他底神氣，如果不對－這常然是不佳的徵兆－甚至聽到「該死，近了」，「糟了，究是晦氣色」之類的自言自語，亦請傳出給記者先生們，好發出個電報來，以慰老百姓：大漢奸即將受審判了。</p>
<p>偵探</p>
<h3>輪紋</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>誰都知道「指紋」是各人不同，而可利用於偵查案件，確定盜賊。予偵探們許多便利，現在發現「輪紋」也很有偵探學上的價値。</p>
<p>每一輛汽車，至少有四個橡皮輪。車輛疾馳過後，路面上就遣下了橡皮胎的花紋，根據了這輪紋，探員們就可以查明經過該處的汽軍是何種式樣。假使每輛汽車的輪胎花紋各各不同的，那末不難立刻決定這汽車的號碼和車主了。</p>
<p>每車一種車胎，似乎是不可能的。但是美國的偵探學者已明白指示出這個可能性了；現在美國所應用的車胎已達三百三十三種不同的花紋了，假使任意配用於四個車輪上，就可有503，107，995輛輪紋相與的汽車。這龐大的數目已足够全美國的汽車採用了。</p>
<p>科學的預言家說，不久的將來，「輪紋學」一定會像「指紋學一樣地發達和利用於偵探術上的。　「輪紋學」現在還是一個很眛生的新名詞，但將來無疑的它將爲犯罪學開一新的紀元，被大家熟悉的稱道着。</p>

<h3>剷除「人間之虎」</h3>
<p>— 飽石溪</p>
<p>虎會吃人，人皆怕虎，於是「談虎色變」。</p>
<p>山中之虎，不必怕，因爲我們可以「明槍易避」。「人間之虎」，不能不懼，因爲牠的「暗箭難防」。</p>
<p>翻看過去的歷史，山中之虎害人者少，「人間之虎」害人者多。戰前「納粹之虎」在西半球，曾經閙得天翻地覆，吃人無算。「日倭之虎」，在東半球，也曾閙得山崩地裂，吃人不少。</p>
<p>還有「朝鮮之虎」，「關東之虎」，「馬尼刺之虎」，「新加坡之虎，「無錫之虎」，「南京之虎」，「北站之虎」……以及「市虎」，「囤虎」，「紙老虎」……不一而足。我們對這羣狐假虎威的人間獸，幸得在天日重光的今日，把牠們橫行無忌的淫威殺退了；結束了牠們的「獸」命，同時才救活了無數生靈的「瘦」命，此後不再受牠們的蹂躪，不再受牠們的侮辱和殘殺了。〔但仍要愼防牠們復活！〕</p>
<p>爲今之計，我們應當羣起而攻！「不入虎穴，焉得虎子，」讓我們大家「深入虎穴」；以「武松打虎」的精神；共同檢舉這批「人間之虎」</p>

<h3>Unifying Military Power and Large-Scale Troop Reduction: The Subcommittee Can Complete Its Work; Seventh General Meeting to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th] The General Assembly Government Organization Subcommittee is scheduled to meet today at 4 PM in the National Assembly Auditorium. The Peaceful Nation-Building Outline Group is scheduled to meet at 9 AM tomorrow morning at the Supreme National Defense Council. The seventh general meeting has been rescheduled to 3 PM tomorrow afternoon and will still be held at the National Government. Zhang Junmai is expected to fly to Chongqing tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th] Zhou Enlai stated the origins of the Party's army, saying that the Nationalist Party's leadership of the army indeed has its revolutionary history, but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was also forced to take up arms. Zeng Qi sympathized with the former because of the Huangpu Military Academy's training and the Northern Expedition's unification, which were justified; the latter also had its difficulties. When Lu Dingyi stated that the nationalization of the army and political democratization should proceed in tandem, he repeatedly clarified that the CCP's army was forced to take to the mountains out of desperation, adding an explanatory footnote to Zhou Enlai's words.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 15th] CCP representative Dong Biwu proposed at the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) today, advocating for a significant reduction in the power of the National Government Chairman, to respond to the Nationalist Party representatives' proposal for government reorganization. The CCP proposal suggests that all orders issued by the Chairman must be approved by the National Government Council, which should be reorganized to include representatives from all parties and factions, becoming the highest decision-making body in the country. A two-thirds majority vote in the council would be able to veto the Chairman's actions. Although heated exchanges occurred during today's PCC meeting, it generally proceeded smoothly. The CCP strongly advocates for the "three-thirds system," where the national political leadership is composed of one-third representatives from the Nationalist Party, one-third from the Communist Party, and one-third from non-partisan groups.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 16th Broadcast: According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Military Subcommittee can complete its work within one month, and the Communist Party's army can be reorganized within two months. At the same time, the Chinese government is prepared to unify military power, establish a Minister of National Defense, implement troop reductions, immediately reducing to one hundred divisions, and after a considerable period, further reducing to sixty divisions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Zhang Qun announced today that the government, in accordance with the Nationalist-Communist agreement, is expanding the National Government structure. A three-person subcommittee has been formed today, with Zhang Qun representing the National Government and Zhou Enlai representing the Communist Party. At today's PCC meeting, Zhang Qun expressed hope that the three-person committee would reorganize the Communist army within three months. He also proposed that the Chinese army should be reduced from 4.8 million to 1.8 million.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] It is anticipated here that as a result of the PCC meeting, the government may undergo a thorough reorganization and reassign ambassadors stationed abroad. If representatives from the CCP and other parties join the administrative structure, some ministers will be reassigned.</p>
<h3>Sixth Meeting of the Consultative Conference: Discussing the Nationalization of the Army; Only by Laying Down Arms Can We Talk About Democracy and Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The sixth meeting of the PCC was held at 9 AM on the 16th, attended by thirty members including Wang Yunwu. The agenda concerned military issues, with proposals from the Youth Party and the Democratic League, explained by members Chen Qitian and Liang Shuming, respectively. The assembly also requested Deputy Minister of Military Administration Lin Wei to attend and report on the progress of military reorganization. Zhang Qun, Zhou Enlai, Shao Lizi, Zeng Qi, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Shenfu, Lu Dingyi, and others successively expressed their opinions on the issue of the nationalization of the army and decided that the subcommittee would summarize the various opinions and submit them to the assembly for discussion. At the beginning of the meeting, Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the number of attending members, and Chairman Sun Ke asked member Chen Qitian to explain his proposal. Chen first stated the purpose of the proposal: (1) to end disputes and achieve unity; (2) to concentrate efforts on strengthening construction; (3) to strengthen unity and stop the civil war; (4) to unify and streamline, and strengthen national defense. Chen emphasized that the nationalization of the army is to build a strong national defense force against foreign aggression, not a force for internal warfare. Talking about democracy and constitutional government under the barrel of a gun is false. Only by laying down arms can we talk about democracy and constitutional government. Chen then explained the specific measures he proposed for implementing the nationalization of the army. Liang Shuming, representing the Democratic League, explained that he agreed with the Youth Party's advocacy for the nationalization of the army, but emphasized large-scale troop reduction and actively engaging in the construction of modern fundamental national defense, namely (1) scientific research, (2) industrial construction, and (3) universal national military training, to strengthen national defense capabilities and jointly seek world peace. He also proposed establishing a Military Planning Committee to implement the nationalization of the army and the task of reducing the standing army, to be completed in stages. Zhang Qun said that according to the ninth item of the government's talks with the CCP, the CCP's army will be reduced. Regarding the number of troops and their stationing, both parties have agreed to have the Military Three-Person Subcommittee discuss the matter. Unfortunately, military conflicts occurred afterwards, and the subcommittee's work was delayed. Although the ceasefire order has now taken effect, reports of conflicts still occurring in various places are received daily. Therefore, the Three-Person Subcommittee needs to be established as soon as possible. Chairman Chiang has appointed Minister Zhang Zhizhong and himself as government representatives, and the CCP representative is Zhou Enlai. Preliminary discussions began yesterday, and it is hoped that a solution can be agreed upon within one month, and the reorganization will be completed within two months. From the date of the agreement, the CCP's army should immediately accept the unified command of the National Government. Zhang expressed hope that the Three-Person Subcommittee would be able to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p>[Public News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Today's PCC meeting was held in the National Government Auditorium, discussing the difficult problems of reorganizing and reducing the Chinese army. Chen Qitian, leader of the Youth Party, proposed a broad outline for the reorganization of the army, advocating for the establishment of a Minister of National Defense and a unified command. He demanded that the army should break away from party affiliations and only be used to resist foreign aggression. He also suggested that a legislative body should supervise the army, and its size should be immediately reduced to one hundred divisions, and later further reduced to sixty divisions. He advocated organizing a committee responsible for implementing the reorganization and demobilization work. Liang Shuming, leader of the Democratic League, agreed in principle with Chen Qitian's proposal, suggesting that the reorganization committee should have five to seven members, including three American advisors, to implement a one-to-two-year plan. Zhou Enlai immediately proposed that the National Army and the Communist Army should be reorganized simultaneously. He agreed to reduce the Communist Army to twenty divisions within six months. Shao Lizi and Zeng Qi suggested that military issues should be resolved separately by the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party, but other representatives insisted that military issues are related to all the people and should not be resolved solely by the two parties. Deputy Minister of Military Administration Lin Wei proposed that the number of National Army troops should be reduced from 4.83 million to 1.8 million in the first half of this year, that is, from 253 divisions to 90 divisions, plus ten cavalry battalions and other special forces. It should be implemented in stages, with each stage lasting three months. The demobilized soldiers should be employed in public works, with 200,000 people building railways, 200,000 people building highways, and 160,000 people engaging in river dredging projects. Demobilized officers, except for a portion sent to the Central Training Corps for vocational and technical training, will all be demobilized.</p>
<h3>Deputy Minister Lin Reports on Military Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Deputy Minister of Military Administration Lin Wei attended the PCC on the 16th and reported on military reorganization measures. The full text of his report is as follows: Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I have been ordered to report on the military reorganization plan and its implementation, which I intend to divide into two stages: the military reorganization situation of the past year and the military reorganization plan for this year. I will explain them separately as follows:</p>
<p>Military Reorganization Situation of the Past Year: First, Reasons for Military Reorganization: Examining the reasons why our country's army must be reorganized, since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, the total number of troops was 49 armies, 128 divisions, and 30 brigades. Subsequently, due to the start of the war and the gradual expansion of the battlefield, by the end of 1944, it had expanded to 129 armies, 354 divisions, 31 brigades, and 15 battalions. This expansion rate, at most, was only double. According to the principle of war mobilization and based on war examples from various countries, it was originally not large. However, due to the low quality of the troops, the number of vacancies gradually increased. Although the numbers increased, the combat effectiveness decreased instead, making reorganization necessary. This is one reason. Secondly, due to the limited financial and material resources of the country, and the deep suffering of the people, it was impossible to continue bearing such a huge military expenditure. This is another reason. In short, the reorganization of the National Army is not only a unanimous request of the Chinese people, but also a unanimous hope of people in allied countries. This military reorganization policy is related to the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance and the lifeblood of the country. The central government originally had a set policy, but due to environmental constraints, it was only decided to implement it last year. The ministry followed the central government's decision and began to work hard to implement it at the beginning of last year. Second, the Purpose of Military Reorganization: The purpose of military reorganization is to adjust the current large and complex army into a necessary and substantial national army. In other words, military reorganization is not a passive reduction of the army, but an active effort to strengthen the combat power of the troops. Before the enemy surrendered, it was used to prepare for a counter-offensive, and in the future, it will be used to consolidate defense and cooperate with allied countries to maintain lasting world peace. Therefore, the military policy set by the ministry for 1945 was: one, to cooperate with the requirements of the counter-offensive and strengthen combat power; two, to cooperate with the national budget and take into account the national financial and material resources. Third, the Central Task of Military Reorganization: The central task of military reorganization can be roughly divided into (1) reorganization and strengthening of troops, (2) improving the lives of officers and soldiers, (3) adjusting military agencies, and (4) settling surplus officers and soldiers. Reorganization and strengthening of troops is the most important task to strengthen the forces of the troops. The ministry measured the requirements of the War of Resistance and the situation of the troops and formulated the principles for the implementation of reorganization in 1945 as follows: (1) All troops should be reduced by one-third. For the convenience of implementing the reorganization, each war zone should be taken as a reorganization unit. That is, a war zone with three armies under its jurisdiction should reduce one army. An army with a three-division system should merge one division. For an army with a two-division system, there are two methods of reorganization. If both divisions retain their numbers, each division should reduce one regiment. The missing regiment will be supplemented by other troops to strengthen its structure. If only the military headquarters and one division are retained, the number of one division must be revoked, and its soldiers transferred to the military headquarters' directly affiliated troops and the retained division. Another division that has completed reorganization will be transferred to strengthen its structure. (2) The reorganization plan for each troop is drafted by the ministry based on the principles and implemented by the war zone. If the war zone makes changes due to actual difficulties, as long as it does not violate the principles, the ministry can approve it. (3) The surplus soldiers of the reorganized troops will be supplemented uniformly, and the vacancies of the reorganized and retained troops will be filled to reduce the number of empty units and increase their actual strength. (4) After each troop has implemented the reorganization in accordance with the reorganization principles, it can start to issue new pay. Troops that have not implemented reorganization in accordance with the principles will still issue old pay. For example, if a certain troop completes the reorganization first, (not finished)</p>
<h3>Proposal by Zhang Lan and Eight Others</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Member Zhang Lan and eight others submitted a proposal on "Realizing the Nationalization of the Army and Large-Scale Troop Reduction" to the sixth meeting of the PCC. The full text is as follows: The undersigned propose that this meeting, in order to lay the foundation for national unity and establish a modern national defense, should adopt the following two principles: (1) All armies in the country should immediately break away from any party affiliation and belong to the state, achieving complete unity of military command and administration (active-duty soldiers must leave their party affiliations). (2) The number of standing armies should be drastically reduced, and active efforts should be made in scientific research, industrial construction, and universal national military training as a fundamental plan for modern national defense. In order to realize the above-mentioned first principle and the point of large-scale troop reduction in the second principle, a Military Planning Committee should be established immediately. This committee should be composed of five to seven members, including the following personnel: (1) military personnel from both domestic parties, (2) military personnel from non-partisan groups, (3) military personnel, and at the same time, one to three American military experts should be hired as advisors to this committee. If necessary, they may be invited to attend meetings or entrusted to assist in planning work. A deadline of one month should be set to formulate all feasible and concrete plans. This plan should achieve the goal of unifying the army under the state and reduce the number of standing armies to the smallest possible extent without hindering completion in stages within two years.</p>
<p>The above plan should be submitted by the committee to this meeting for review and approval, and then implemented by the National Government. During implementation, the committee should still be responsible for supervision and review until the task is completed. The above is presented for the consideration of the general assembly for a decision. Proposers: Zhang Lan, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Zhang Zhongfu, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Junmai, Zhang Bojun.</p>
<h3>Plan for the Rehabilitation of Honored Veterans Has Been Drafted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 16th] It is learned that the Ministry of Military Administration has drafted a national plan for the rehabilitation of honored veterans. It will soon be submitted to the highest authorities for approval before it can be implemented. The plan proposes to reorganize the existing eleven Honored Veteran Management Offices into Honored Veterans' Aftercare Administration Bureaus. Five bureaus will be established nationwide, with attached reclamation corps, production cooperatives, and schools for the children of honored veterans.</p>
<h3>Changxing Establishes Command Post, Sun Yuanliang Concurrently Serves as Director</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changxing, 16th] The director of the Changxing Command Post of the First Pacification Zone of the Xuzhou Headquarters, concurrently held by Sun Yuanliang, has been established and has begun pacification work. The area under its jurisdiction includes twenty counties in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, including Yixing, Liyang, Wuxing, Jiaxing, Guangde, Ningguo, Wuhu, and Xuancheng. The Jinghu Pacification Work Supervision Group has also set off to various places to carry out supervision work.</p>
<h3>Although the Mediation Department Is Working, Conflicts Continue to Occur</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The Military Mediation Execution Department (MMED) is scheduled to start working at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital on the 16th. Robinson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying discussed this matter this morning. Today, reporters asked personnel from the three parties about the situation of the cessation of conflicts. All answered that the communication lines had not been established yet, and no reports had been received from all parties. The three commissioners also agreed that they would issue press releases for future events and not make separate statements. Yesterday and today, the three men have been active separately. Ye Jianying visited Chief Sun and Mayor Xiong this afternoon. It is heard that Director Li Zongren will welcome the personnel of the MMED to Beiping tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The MMED will send small groups composed of the Nationalists, Communists, and Americans to various conflict areas to investigate the truth and implement mediation. It is expected that there will be one group every hundred li, and more than 400 personnel of the MMED will fly in one after another. The authorities are quite concerned about the reception of these large numbers of guests. Huang Renlin has considered moving out the less important guests of the "Beijing" and "Six Nations" hotels to accommodate these peacemakers. To facilitate the residence of Communist personnel, the authorities have designated Cuiming Villa as a special residence. This building is also in the East City. Before the war, it was the residence of Mei Lanfang, and during the occupation, the Japanese used it for welcoming guests. After the victory, many Northeast personnel traveling between Chongqing and Changchun stayed here. The three groups of personnel of the MMED will start working at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which has been closed for a long time, tomorrow. Paul Wen, the director of general affairs of the hospital, who was once regarded by the Japanese as one of the three major foreign political prisoners during the occupation, has vacated most of the good rooms for their use. Bao Wen told reporters in a pleasant tone that when the authorities came to borrow the hospital as the office of the MMED, he readily agreed, because their great mission is of great importance to China's peace and the overall world situation. The hospital is very honored to be their office. On the first two days after the ceasefire order was issued, both the government and the Communist Party received reports of continued conflicts. For example, Lu Wenzhen told reporters on the evening of the 13th that there were more than ten reports of Communist troops attacking on the 12th and 13th. Ye Jianying also said in his speech after getting off the plane that when the plane took off from Chongqing, he had received a report of a conflict in Lingyuan Gubeikou. But as of today, reports of conflicts in the north have indeed gradually subsided. The price of grain in Beiping is also falling day by day, and smiles are gradually appearing on the thin faces of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Minister Wu Hopes the Communist Party Will Abandon Meaningless Propaganda</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen expressed great regret when he met with reporters today regarding the Communist Party's criticism that "the National Army violated the ceasefire order." He deeply hoped that the Communist Party could abandon "unconscious propaganda." Regarding rumors that Madame Chiang had gone to Shenyang, Minister Wu declined to comment.</p>
<h3>The MMED Issues a Public Notice</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The MMED issued its first press release at 11:30 PM on the 15th as follows: The MMED has decided to dispatch U.S. Marine Corps aircraft to 14 cities and villages in the provinces of Suiyuan, Rehe, and Hebei on the 16th to distribute the order to cease conflict in order to stop the local conflicts that are still taking place in various places. The above order was also dropped in Chifeng, Rehe Province, this morning. According to reports from the government army, conflicts are still taking place in Nanxiangyu in the southwest area of Gubeikou, and in Zhuozishan, Jining, Fengzhen, Gui Sui, Wuchuan, and Helin in Suiyuan Province. It was decided on the morning of the 16th to send planes to the above-mentioned places to drop the order to cease conflict. Gui Sui is the location of the government army's garrison headquarters in Suiyuan Province, while the Communist army is stationed in Jining, Fengzhen, Wuchuan, and Helin. It is reported that small-scale conflicts have also occurred. In Yongnian County in southwestern Hebei, in addition to distributing the order to cease conflict, a notice signed by the three commissioners of the MMED will also be dropped, allowing food and goods to pass through the conflict zone to relieve the famine of the local people. On the Jinpu Line, the MMED has decided to distribute the order to cease conflict in four places, namely Lianzhen, Dongguang, Botou, and Cangxian, to stop the conflict in that area. The same order will also be dropped in Yanzhou, about 80 miles south of Jinan, and Liaocheng, near the Grand Canal. In addition to sending U.S. Marine Corps aircraft to the conflict areas, the MMED commissioners announced that they would soon dispatch ceasefire execution teams to the conflict areas to contact the commanders of the troops in each area, investigate the actual situation, and report to the headquarters.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Headquarters Will Move Back to Changchun; Shenyang Citizens Welcome the National Army</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The situation in the Northeast is gradually improving. The Northeast Headquarters, which was originally planned to move from Beiping to Jinzhou, is now planned to move back to Changchun. Our army is scheduled to enter Shenyang today. Xiong Shihui plans to go to inspect the situation with the army and return to Beiping around the 20th. Madame Chiang will definitely fly to Changchun with Chiang Ching-kuo recently. The welcoming arrangements in Changchun are being jointly prepared by the Chinese and Soviet sides. Gao Xibing, chairman of Andong and Dalian, who is anxious about the lack of news, may go to Changchun recently to seek a solution as soon as possible. Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian is still touring Qingdao and has not returned. It is thought that he is using the free time before the Dalian issue is decided to observe the Qingdao municipal administration as much as possible for reference for Dalian's administration. Wu Yanzhang, chairman of Xing'an, said to our reporter today that his trip had been postponed again and again because heavy snow in the Northeast prevented the plane from landing. He joked, "If you see the newspaper, I have already flown to Changchun four or five days ago."</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Jiang Ching-kuo, the Northeast Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, paid a visit to Chairman Chiang yesterday and will fly to Beiping and then to Changchun in the Northeast within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The National Army entered Shenyang at 3:30 PM today. The citizens gathered at the Huanggu Village Railway Station to welcome them. The whole city was decorated with flags, and the enthusiastic scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 16th] The troops of the National Army who are going to Shenyang to take over defense have arrived in three trains on the 15th. The third train arrived safely on the morning of the 16th, and the fourth train also set off from Jinzhou and is expected to arrive in the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Air transport was strengthened today compared to the previous day, and another batch of soldiers arrived. In addition, Chen Tao from the Ministry of Military Administration, Pan Zhonglu from the Central News Agency, and 30 other personnel for the takeover arrived.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 14th] After the establishment of the Songjiang Provincial Government, the various takeover works proceeded smoothly. Regarding the takeover of the counties, Shuangcheng, the first county of Songjiang, was taken over first with the assistance of the Soviet side. Fu Yuncheng, the county magistrate of the county, and Yang Zhishi, the director of the police bureau, officially took over the county administration today. As for the other 20 counties, they will be taken over gradually.</p>
<h3>Premier Song Has Drafted a Whole Plan to Relieve the Housing Shortage in the Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Chongqing News: After Premier Song Ziwen returned to Chongqing, he reported the general serious housing shortage in the recovered areas to Chairman Chiang. He was approved by the Chairman to borrow 800 million yuan from the Four Banks to the Nanjing Municipal Government for construction purposes. The Nanjing Municipal Engineering Bureau is stepping up the design and construction. It is heard that Premier Song has recently drafted a whole plan to relieve the housing shortage in the recovered areas. The loan method will slightly imitate Nanjing, and the areas will include major cities such as Shanghai, Hankou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Changsha, Tianjin, Beiping, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xuzhou, and Zhengzhou. The measures will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army's Unceasing Attacks on Lin and Zao</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Office, 16th] As of midnight on the 15th, the Communist army surrounding Zaozhuang and Lincheng has not ceased its offensive. The entire Lin-Zao branch line of the Jinpu Railway is filled with the sound of artillery fire. Before the ceasefire deadline, the Communist army, which had been driven out of the coal mines by the National Army, has, after reinforcements, once again approached the mines. The mine police guarding the mine shafts have suffered almost complete casualties. The miners and their families are now using all sorts of heavy weapons to fight a desperate battle against the Communist army. The National Army originally assisting in the defense of the Zaozhuang coal mines is very small in number and strictly adheres to the ceasefire order, taking no active actions. Witnessing the indiscriminate slaughter of hundreds of innocent miners' families by the rampaging Communist army, they are burning with anger but unable to disobey orders and engage in combat. Many are weeping bitterly and cursing the Communist Party for its utter lack of conscience. On the night of the 14th, they repeatedly requested their superiors to allow them to resign from their military posts, wishing to fight the Communist army as civilians. The unit commander of the National Army firmly refused, tearfully explaining the greater good. Last night, north of Xuzhou, the north wind howled and water froze into ice. The National Army there was unprepared for war, and most of the field hospitals had been closed. As a result, the injured soldiers and civilians carried from Lincheng and Zaozhuang bled onto their stretchers, and the dripping blood froze into ice, the ice shavings falling to the ground, a horrific scene of red and white intermingling. A former teacher at a miners' children's school, lying on a stretcher, cried out miserably, "The Communist Party is so cruel! Please, reporters from Chongqing, Nanjing, and Shanghai, come and see this hell on earth!"</p>
<h3>Rumor: Fu Zuoyi's Four Resignations Were Not Approved</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 16th] A person from Chongqing said: It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi has resigned four times from his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth War Zone and Chairman of Suiyuan Province, but his resignations have not been approved. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek even offered him warm words of comfort. Allied generals and reporters stationed in China have great respect for Fu. Last autumn, after General Wedemeyer inspected Fu's troops from western Suiyuan and returned to Chongqing, he praised Fu as a rare and outstanding general. The rumor that Fu intended to resign because the Communist Party demanded his dismissal from his military post is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Executes Female Spy</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from United Press, Guangzhou, 16th) Huang Meili (female, transliteration), accused of collaborating with the Japanese and acting as a spy, was executed yesterday. She was 25 years old and lived in Japan as a child. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, she married a Japanese man and was accused of collecting military intelligence about China for the Japanese.</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>Dispatch from our Kunming Office: The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Kunming-Guangzhou passenger plane service has been reduced to one flight per week, starting from the 14th, due to a shortage of pilots. The company also has several planes in India that will be flown to Kunming for use soon.</p>
<p>Dispatch from Chongqing: The newly appointed French Ambassador, Mr. Meyrier, presented his credentials to the National Government today. The ceremony was held in the Auditorium, so the Political Consultative Conference was rescheduled to 3:00 PM. The topic of discussion was the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Sun Yueqi, Responsible for Receiving Northeast Industry and Mining, Flies to Changchun with Experts - Agreement Reached in Moscow Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 15th] Sun Yueqi, responsible for receiving industry and mining, returned to Beiping from Chongqing by special plane on the 14th, accompanied by more than 20 experts. Sun will fly to Changchun tomorrow morning to negotiate the handover of industrial and mining affairs. According to well-informed sources, in the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Moscow, an agreement seems to have been reached on industrial and mining issues. China will jointly operate several factories and mines with the Soviet Union. Chiang Ching-kuo's trip to Moscow seems to have been quite successful.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 15th] The Northeast industrial and mining issue shows clear signs of resolution. Amidst rumors of Chiang Ching-kuo's return to Chongqing, the highest authorities summoned Sun Yueqi, responsible for receiving industrial and mining, to Chongqing by long-distance telephone on the 10th. Sun flew to Chongqing on the 11th for instructions. Today, Sun sent a telegram here stating that he would fly north by special plane today, stay overnight in Beiping, and fly to Changchun on the 16th to receive Northeast industrial and mining. He has also designated Hu Ankai, Xu Yingqi, Ma Shiliang, Sun Wenzao, Ji Jimin, Yang Zhiping, Tao Yongming, Du Chunyan, Yu Changju, and Yang Yunzhi, ten experts in Beiping, to accompany him. Currently, the handover of Northeast industry and mining has begun partially, with Soviet personnel accompanying them. It is understood that not many of the key factory and mine machinery and equipment in the Northeast have been shipped abroad. Some lost machinery is still within Northeast China, and under certain circumstances, this machinery is expected to return to its posts and work. The detailed results of Chiang Ching-kuo's negotiations with the Soviets on industry and mining are still unknown here as of the time of this dispatch. It is generally believed that the Soviet side may participate in several factories and mines in the Northeast with its technology and capital.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Jinzhou, 15th] The slow progress of the National Army in receiving various areas in the nine eastern provinces indicates that the negotiations between Zhang Jia'ao, Special Economic Envoy for the Northeast, and Malinovsky in Changchun are of utmost importance. The crux of the negotiations seems to be the formulation of detailed measures for Soviet participation in various undertakings in the nine eastern provinces. To date, the authorities have not indicated that Soviet troops will remain in the nine eastern provinces beyond February 1. The Chinese authorities still assume that the handover can be completed after that month, but according to most observers here, Malinovsky's forces may not be able to complete their withdrawal within the next eighteen days. There are various reasons for this speculation; some believe that winter weather is not conducive to troop movements, while others claim that the Soviet side has not obtained sufficient coal on the Changchun Railway to run trains. However, the most compelling reason is that several key points in the Sino-Soviet economic negotiations have not yet been resolved. The United Press reporter has learned the nature of the key points in the negotiations from the most reliable sources here, but the Soviet side has not confirmed these claims. First, the Soviet Union has requested to obtain commercial airports in major cities in the nine eastern provinces, such as Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang, to connect with the free port of Dalian and the naval base of Lushun. They also plan to lay telephone lines from Manzhouli on the Sino-Soviet border directly to Dalian. Second, it is rumored that the Soviet Union is demanding joint control of half of the heavy industry in the nine eastern provinces, including coal and iron. Third, the Soviets, having purchased assets from the Japanese, intend to continue to retain ownership of them on Chinese territory. The Chinese side has not yet given a definite answer to the above points. Zhang Jia'ao's position, approved by the central government, is reportedly that any matter involving Soviet interests should be based on the rights and interests Russia held in Manchuria before the Russo-Japanese War forty-one years ago as a basis for negotiation. Briefly, this refers to the ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway, navigation rights on the Songhua River, land purchase rights in the railway zone, mining and logging rights, the right to install and operate telephone and telegraph lines, postal and judicial rights, exemption from taxes to the Chinese government, and the management rights of the railway zone. However, it is rumored that Malinovsky's position is that Japan established heavy industry in the nine eastern provinces in preparation for war with the Soviet Union and the United Nations, so as a result of the war, the Soviet Union has the right to take the industry in the nine eastern provinces as war spoils. According to authoritative sources, this point is still under discussion among the four major powers. There are many rumors about the systematic removal of heavy industrial equipment and machinery. Some believe that the Soviet Union will still return the factory equipment, but only on the condition that the Soviet Union has a say in the operation of the factories. However, many rumors are just hearsay. The Chinese side has not had the opportunity to thoroughly inspect most of the industries in the nine eastern provinces. Only after complete control of the nine eastern provinces can the extent of industrial damage be assessed. According to Chinese officials, the extent of the demolition of flour and textile mills in Jinzhou is not as severe as initially reported, so the reports from other industrial areas in the nine eastern provinces cannot be fully believed. A definitive conclusion can only be reached after a thorough inspection of the major coal, iron mines, and factories. Some rumors also say that most of the locomotives and freight trains on the railways are missing. Few locomotives and trains remain in the small area from the Great Wall to Xinmin. It is rumored that 2,000 locomotives are concentrated in a certain location near the northern border of Korea, but this claim has not been confirmed. Another rumor says that trains loaded with supplies were driven to Manzhouli in Soviet territory, but this has also not been confirmed.</p>

<h3>Speech by Our Representative Gu Weijun: Urges Speedy Establishment of the Trusteeship System - China Firmly Believes in the Principle of Collective Peace - Willing to Do Its Utmost to Help the United Nations Complete Its Mission</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Dr. Gu Weijun, China's Chief Representative, following the Iranian representative yesterday, addressed the United Nations General Assembly, hoping that the Trusteeship Committee would be established without delay. He said that the Trusteeship System is a significant improvement over the Mandate System, and tens of millions of people will benefit from it. The Trusteeship System can accelerate the political, economic, social, and educational development of the people in the mandated territories, so that their desire to establish autonomous governments and achieve independence can be realized soon. China is determined to do its utmost to help the United Nations complete its mission. The Chinese people firmly believe in the principle of collective peace and are willing to subordinate their national interests to collective security. Therefore, they know that the United Nations cannot and will not fail. The five committees recommended by the Preparatory Committee to be established by the Economic and Social Council, of which the Human Rights Committee is of paramount importance, are a good start. The United Nations should take as its main principle the encouragement and respect for the rights and freedoms of peoples, without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion, which is an event of deep interest to people around the world. Lasting peace should be premised on respect for individual dignity. Dr. Gu also expressed his gratitude for the establishment of the Narcotics Committee, as drug use has been increasing since the outbreak of the war. In every war, the enemy has pursued a policy of drug poisoning in the Far East, so drug prohibition is a matter of urgent importance.</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th) Last night, at the United Nations General Assembly, as the President, Mr. Spaak, was about to adjourn after the speech of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, he announced that the British Foreign Minister Mr. Bevin would deliver a speech at 10:30 AM on Thursday (6:30 PM Shanghai time). The Assembly will debate the report of the Preparatory Committee today. The representatives of El Salvador, Ecuador, and Norway will speak. The representatives of Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Poland will speak in the afternoon. In addition to Mr. Bevin, two others will speak on Thursday morning. The Security Council will meet on Thursday afternoon, and the Assembly will not hold a meeting. Ten people will speak on Friday, representing India, Czechoslovakia, Australia, South Africa, Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Canada, Greece, Byelorussia, Ukraine and France.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech will declare that Britain is prepared to transfer its mandated territories to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. However, with regard to Palestine, no decision can be made until the joint British-American Palestine Investigation Committee submits its report. Bevin will also declare the British government's opinion that Transjordan, currently under mandate, has reached the stage where it can become an independent country. According to sources in London, the Kingdom of Yemen may apply to join the United Nations next year. The Emir of Transjordan, Abdullah, may come to London next month to negotiate with the British government and the United Nations. Transjordan has not yet joined the United Nations. After its sovereignty is recognized, it may not complete the procedures for applying for membership before the end of this session of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly - Second Day of Debate - Touches on the Issues of Iran and the East Indies</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Since the convening of the United Nations General Assembly in London last week, it was only last night that the urgency of the world's "danger spots" was deeply understood for the first time, especially in the Middle East and Asia. On the second day of the general debate at the Assembly, the representatives of Iran, China, and the Netherlands spoke. The dispute in Azerbaijan, the turmoil in Indonesia, and the threat of the atomic bomb were the most pressing concerns for the representatives. The head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Gromyko, sat solemnly with his hand on his chin, listening to the speech of Mr. Taghizadeh, the head of the Iranian delegation, who declared that Iran reserved the right to submit the Iranian issue to the Assembly for discussion, and said that Iran, for the sake of the overall situation, had not requested that the Iranian issue be placed on the agenda of this session. However, if the issue is not resolved outside the conference hall soon, Iran may ask the Assembly to consider it. After the Iranian representative finished speaking, the applause in the hall was weak, and the applauders were not without embarrassment. After the applause subsided, the Soviet representative and the Soviet Ukrainian representative immediately discussed separately. It was seen that Mr. Manuilsky in the Soviet Ukrainian delegation shook his head and made a gesture of negation. The first to mention Indonesia was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Schermerhorn, who said that social changes had taken place in the Dutch East Indies, which were "close to a social revolution." The Dutch side is working with the people of Indonesia "with a radical attitude" to deal with the problem. The passion of the oppressed people of Asia and Europe is incomparable to that before the war. Both physically and mentally, they have felt the shameful consequences of the unrestrained brutality of the war, as if they were in hell. Therefore, these countries are eager for new political reforms. The atomic bomb issue was also raised by Schermerhorn, who said that in a short period of time, many other countries, including smaller ones, will learn the secrets of atomic energy explosion. Human evolution has reached a critical stage, and there is only a short time left to place policies on a solid foundation of humanitarian principles. Schermerhorn went on to urge the speedy establishment of a trusteeship system, saying that the Dutch delegation believes that the opinions and wishes of the people in the trust territories should be taken into account. How to "listen to the voices of these people themselves" should be one of the most important issues to be discussed. Dr. Gu Weijun, China's Chief Representative, rose to speak next, seconding the plan to establish a Trusteeship Council quickly (see speech above).</p>
<p>It is heard that the petitions sent from all over the world to the Secretariat of the General Assembly are as numerous as snowflakes, including four different groups, such as the Indonesian Youth Federation in India, all requesting an immediate solution to the Indonesian problem. These requests, along with the "Irish issue" and the requests of the two national assemblies of Slovakia and Armenia to each occupy a seat in the United Nations Organization, will be handled by a special subcommittee.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Weapons - For Security Purposes - Recommendation of the Chairman of the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, London, 15th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold its first meeting this Thursday. According to the temporary rules of the Assembly, the chairmanship will be rotated in order of the first letter of the names of the member states. Australian Minister Makin has been designated by his government as a member of the Security Council and will serve as Chairman of the first meeting.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Mr. Makin, the Chief Representative of Australia, who is expected to be elected as Chairman of the United Nations Security Council and is responsible for organizing the international security force, spoke yesterday, advocating that atomic energy weapons be used by the international military force to protect world peace. Mr. Makin stated that the United Nations Charter has stipulated that the military power and resources of the member states should be pooled to maintain international peace and security. When the Charter was signed, the secrets of atomic energy were little known, but the nature of atomic weapons is not incompatible with the general provisions of the Charter regarding the allocation of military power, assistance, and facilitation. Atomic energy is not only used for destruction. If it can be used for the economic and material benefit of all the people of the world, it may have significant construction power.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Attends the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, London, 15th] Our government has appointed Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun as our country's representative to the United Nations Security Council, and Ambassador to the Soviet Union Fu Bingchang as the deputy representative.</p>
<h3>Methods for Organizing International Police Force Under Consideration</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, London, 16th] According to well-informed sources, the US military will serve as the United Nations police force, planned according to geographical distribution, so that in the event of any act of aggression, it can be dispatched to suppress it at any time. The detailed methods are being considered by the United States, pending future discussions with the Chiefs of Staff Committee of the four countries, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. The principles on which the United States is based are as follows: Each geographical unit should include units of equal naval and air power, the number of personnel should be determined by two factors, namely (1) what is needed to handle the event itself, (2) what is necessary to maintain the military prestige of the United Nations and the equivalent of political prestige. Regarding the latter, it probably means that the number of troops retained must be more than the military needs. Each country will allocate troops based on its resources, so the United States and Britain may supply the navy and air force, while the Soviet Union will supply the army. This US plan is subject to Congressional approval.</p>
<h3>Decision to Conduct Thorough Study on the Declaration of Human Rights</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] Mr. Mudaliar, the Chief Representative of India to the United Nations General Assembly, told our agency that the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations will decide on the organization of its Human Rights Committee when it convenes a meeting within days. The Cuban representative has suggested that the General Assembly discuss human rights and issue a declaration of the rights of individuals and nations, but since the task of this General Assembly is only to discuss various institutions and set up various councils, the issue of human rights does not need to be discussed in the Assembly. The issue of atomic energy, because it is too important, has been placed on the agenda of the Assembly, but the issuance of a declaration of human rights will not be postponed. The Economic and Social Council will study the matter at its first session. The issue of the human rights of men and women was already discussed at the San Francisco Conference, and the Charter has also clearly stipulated that the Economic and Social Council should establish a Human Rights Committee. The Human Rights Committee is the only committee explicitly mentioned in the Charter. It is my opinion that when the report of the Human Rights Committee to the Economic and Social Council is delivered to the General Assembly, the latter may consider issuing a declaration of human rights. It is expected that this issue can be discussed in the second phase of the General Assembly. The proper procedure would be for the General Assembly to regard the declaration as a convention and submit it to the member states for adoption.</p>
<h3>Two-Nation Subcommittee to Handle Requests from All Parties</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 16th] The United Nations Standing Committee appointed China and Venezuela last night as members of a subcommittee to handle the various requests submitted to the Secretariat of the Assembly by minorities and groups around the world. The first item is the Indonesian issue, which is the request submitted by four groups, including the "Indonesian Youth Federation in India." Two Romanian groups raised the Jewish issue. The Polish General Federation and the Armenian National Committee requested to send representatives to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, London, 15th] The United Nations General Affairs Committee announced today that it had received a telegram from the Italian government applying for membership. Soviet Representative Gromyko opposed forwarding the telegram to the Security Council. Finally, Mr. Spaak, the President of the Assembly, expressed his opinion that the application for membership telegram should be specially filed.</p>
<h3>Statement by Prime Minister of East Indies</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Batavia, 16th] Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir again issued a statement to the press yesterday stating that the Indonesian people are eager for a peaceful solution and hope that the United Nations General Assembly can make a decision on this matter. We have already declared independence, so any agreement, whether public or secret, that we have not participated in the negotiations, cannot have a binding effect on us.</p>
<h3>Application of Radio Wave Heating in American Industry - Faster than Steam Heating</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from American News Agency, New York, 15th] According to a recent report in Wall Street Journal, the method of generating heat using radio waves, which began to be invented before the war, is now actually working in factories. A large rubber factory in Fall River, Massachusetts, has used radio wave heating to repair huge hard rubber wheels, and the new method takes only 18 minutes, while the old method using steam heating takes 5 hours. Another Midwestern candy manufacturer is also using radio wave heating to make its candy. Candy factories can use radio waves to heat peanuts to 130 degrees, while preserving their flavor. Winemakers are studying how to use radio wave heating to reduce the bottle. Because radio wave heating can pass through glass bottles without being hindered. The radio waves used for heating are similar to the short waves used in radar broadcasting. The radio waves themselves have no heat, but when the waves are blocked by a substance, the waves excite the molecular structure of the substance and release heat. Radio wave heating engineers have predicted that within five years, the number of radio wave heating equipment sold annually will reach US$150 million.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Chicago, 15th] Several glass manufacturing experts announced at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers the invention of a plaster containing glass fiber, which can be used to manufacture train roofs, with greater strength than other building materials and resistant to corrosion. This glass fiber can also be used to strengthen concrete.</p>
<h3>President Truman Issues Statement Saying the U.S. Should Request Long-Term Control of Certain Pacific Islands from the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] President Truman announced yesterday: The U.S. government, in view of actual needs, believes that long-term control of various islands in the Pacific region is necessary for national security. The U.S. government should request the United Nations to grant sole trusteeship. For other islands that the U.S. does not wish to retain, the U.N. should administer the trusteeship. The U.S. will maintain considerable interest, together with other allied nations, in other islands that did not previously belong to Japan. Reports from London state that the U.S. delegation attending the U.N. General Assembly has not reached a consensus on whether the Japanese islands conquered by the U.S. should be placed under the sovereignty of the U.N. Truman's statement is to clarify this matter. President Truman also stated that the specific islands necessary for U.S. security have not been definitively determined. He believes that islands within the necessary security range should be governed by the U.S. alone, under the supervision of the U.N. Security Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Newspapers report that the U.S. delegation attending the U.N. General Assembly has a draft proposal regarding the control of Pacific islands. Authoritative sources also say that the U.S. State Department is cooperating with Army and Navy officials to study plans regarding islands seized from Japan. However, State Department personnel have refused to comment on these newspaper reports, stating that it is the State Department's consistent policy not to comment on matters being handled by delegates attending international conferences. A report from London states that these drafts propose placing important islands under U.N. trusteeship, but it is necessary to reach an understanding to include these islands within the U.S. "military strategic zone."</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 15th] A subcommittee of the U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee has departed to inspect U.S. military bases in the Pacific region to determine which should be retained. The committee has arrived in Tokyo and will hold meetings with Army Commander General MacArthur and senior officials of the Allied Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt Speaks to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 15th] Mrs. Roosevelt, President Roosevelt's widow, today hosted all the news reporters for the first time, saying that countries aligned with the Nazi party, such as Italy, should be allowed to join the U.N. organization as soon as they qualify. This issue should be decided by a special committee of the U.N. When reporters asked Mrs. Roosevelt about the rumor that former British Prime Minister Churchill might be nominated as Secretary-General, she replied that she did not believe Churchill would welcome this suggestion. She then added that she was disappointed by the small number of women attending this U.N. General Assembly. She would like to see more female representatives attend because the more women feel a direct relationship with the success or failure of an event, the more interested they will become.</p>
<h3>Sincere Cooperation Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union Will Ensure the Success of the New Organization: El Salvador's Representative Addresses the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] At this morning's meeting of the U.N. organization General Assembly, the Salvadoran Ambassador Plenipotentiary, the head of the country's delegation, Mr. Grallero, delivered a speech, the main points of which were: With the participation of the United States and the Soviet Union, humanity can hope that the establishment of lasting peace by the U.N. organization will be successful. The League of Nations in 1920 was different because these two powerful nations did not participate. This morning was a gathering of Latin American nations. Representatives from Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico are all prepared to present their respective countries' views to the General Assembly. Grallero, speaking in fluent French, said that he had participated in the work of the first General Assembly of the League of Nations in 1920 and is now attending the first General Assembly of the United Nations, which is truly rare. After 25 years, well-intentioned people have gathered again with the same hope. Their efforts in 1920 were unfortunately unsuccessful. Now they are regrouping and trying again to maintain humanity and prevent the scourge of war. Recalling the events of 1920, he cannot forget the spirit of trust and hope that he held when the first General Assembly of the League of Nations began its work. The original charter was not perfect, which is a fact, because the general intentions of its original authors had changed significantly when it was drafted. However, the necessary principles of upholding international morality are inscribed in the preface to the charter, which has always been the foundation for people to enjoy harmonious life. The initial charter sought the union of nations, intending to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all countries. Its member states guaranteed that they would conduct international relations openly, based on justice and honor, strictly abide by the principles of international law, and respect treaty obligations, thereby reassuring the people and guaranteeing their future security. What promise could be better than this? However, as everyone knows, the evolution of the situation, the activities of evil forces, and the weakness of humanity failed to contain it. As a result, the charter, whether in spirit or in letter, was not implemented, and from that time on, the fate of the League of Nations was decided. However, great progress was made within the scope of international law, which was an achievement of the League of Nations. The work completed by the Permanent Court of International Justice it established has influenced the conscience of various countries. Now, the United Nations organization brings new hope to the world. The two most powerful countries in the world, which did not attend the 1920 General Assembly, are now here, prepared to cooperate in safeguarding peace. These two countries are the United States, to which all the people of the American hemisphere closely adhere, and the Soviet Union, which guarantees that international stable order must be linked.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Reports on the Situation of U.S. Troop Demobilization</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower attended an informal congressional meeting today, reporting on the situation of U.S. troop demobilization, stating that every soldier who has 45 points or has served for 30 months can be discharged on April 30th. Those with 40 points or who have served for two years can be discharged on July 1st. Unnecessary soldiers can be discharged immediately, except for those who have served for too short a period. Eisenhower also compared the Army's occupation forces to firefighters, saying that firefighters may sometimes be seen playing and doing nothing, but they are not dismissed and sent home because there may be a time in the future when they are needed urgently. The same is true of our occupation forces; they must be maintained at a safe level, because even if it is not possible to have everyone working every day, there may be a time in the future when they are needed. The order that those who have served for 30 months will be discharged means that 2.2 million people can be demobilized by the end of April, of which 500,000 are in the Pacific region. By July 1st, another 500,000 people will be demobilized, at which time the total remaining force will be 1.5 million people. However, too rapid demobilization will cause the army's organization to "collapse." Subsequently, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Nimitz reported that the Navy's demobilization is still proceeding according to the original plan.</p>
<h3>British Army Agrees on Whether Soviet Troops Will Be Stationed in Japan Is Undecided</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Undersecretary of State Acheson confirmed that Britain has agreed to have an Australian general lead a unit of the British Commonwealth to be stationed in Japan. British troops may not be able to go to Japan until two or three months later. The State Department has not yet received a reply on whether the Soviet Union also intends to send troops to be stationed in Japan. The Soviet government has not yet indicated whether it is willing to have the Red Army placed under MacArthur's command.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters today notified the Japanese government that any existing or old aeronautical research equipment is not allowed to be used or moved without authorization from headquarters.</p>
<h3>Chinese Newspaper to Be Published in Tokyo</h3>

The chief of staff presided over the meeting, instructing them to prepare for all matters related to the surrender and first accepting their various survey tables, including the number of personnel, education level, technicians, the number of Taiwanese and Koreans, existing weapons, transportation and communication equipment, ammunition, clothing and equipment, occupied houses and furniture, and the investigation of military animals. He also instructed them to prepare for the surrender of weapons. The meeting lasted half an hour, and the Japanese officers and soldiers all complied.</p>
<p>Tanjin: Supervising Japanese Prisoners of War to Repair Highways: Tanjin is located at the intersection of the Jinwu Highway and the Zhendan Jinpiao Highway. After the victory, it was occupied by bandits, and the highway bridges were all destroyed, causing traffic to come to a standstill. Now, under the supervision of the Highway Administration, Japanese prisoners of war are stepping up repairs. In addition to the Jinwu section (Wujin to Jintan), which has already been repaired, the Danjin section will also be completed within a specified period, and traffic will be restored to both sections within a month.</p>
<p>Nanchang: Relief for Rural Areas After the Disaster in Nanchang: Before the War of Resistance, the rural areas around Nanchang were already bankrupt. During the war, the Japanese invaders targeted the destruction of rural areas, burning and plundering everywhere. Of the 83 counties in Jiangxi, only 15, including Guangze, were not poisoned. The remaining 60 counties were all ravaged. The most severely affected were Nanchang, Gao'an, De'an, and Xinjian counties. In the third and fifth districts of Nanchang County, all villages and houses were completely burned down. Now, the displaced refugees are returning one after another, and problems have arisen with food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Zhang Guo, the director of the Jiangxi Good Relief Sub-Office, except for Nanchang, which is directly handled by the sub-office, the rest are the responsibility of the itinerant work team. Regarding the economy, the operating expenses for the recent three months were 140,000,000 yuan. The task is to distribute plowing cattle seeds and cotton clothes, as well as basic building materials, to build thatched houses north of Liangjiadu to shelter refugees, and to distribute winter clothes. Director Zhang is currently going to Shanghai to apply for medicines to provide medical treatment. At the same time, a large-scale civilian hospital will be built in Niuhang to protect the health of the refugees.</p>
<p>Mingguang: The Electric Zhongxing Bank First Recovers Counterfeit Currency: According to a report from the County Chamber of Commerce Director Li Yuncheng, "It has been found that this town is located at the strategic point of the Jinpu Railway, and merchants gather here. Recently, peddlers from outside have been transporting counterfeit currency, which is flooding the market. There are also no exchange offices set up, making it difficult to circulate, and the future of commerce has been suspended. The responsibility of this association lies in urgently seeking a remedy. Therefore, a meeting of the Grain Trade Association was convened. After the meeting, the various trade associations sorted out the counterfeit currency stored in the stores, handed it over to this association, and sent personnel to Beijing to exchange it. Please send a letter to the Central Bank to prioritize the recovery and maintain local finance." County Magistrate Shi has sent a telegram to the Central Bank in Nanjing to investigate and request that it be recovered as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Qingdao: Communist Troops Stop Military Operations: Since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representatives Zhou Enlai, etc., negotiated with the National Government representative Zhang Qun and the U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshall, in Chongqing regarding the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists Armies, since this week, the sabotage actions of the communist troops along the Jiaoji Railway have subsided slightly, unlike the previous rampant actions. Since the 10th of this month, all communist troops in the Jiaodong area of Shandong Province have stopped military vehicle operations, the blockade of various villages in the rural areas has gradually been lifted, and the forced requisition of civilian laborers has also gradually decreased. The people of Jiaodong all place great hope on this Political Consultative Conference. The Jiaoji Railway is currently being repaired for the past two or three days. If there are no other changes, it can be opened to traffic to Gaomi within days.</p>
<h3>Rome Has Turned into a Beggar City: It is estimated that there are 150,000 Impoverished Refugees. After the Allied Forces Left, the Music of Accordions Also Disappeared</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 15th] Rome has always been known as the "Eternal City." Even the art of begging is different from other places, always with some musical atmosphere. But now the situation has changed. No more music is heard, only the true appearance of beggars can be seen, with tattered clothes, dirty bodies, rotten sores and diseases, reaching out their hands to ask for money. According to the city government's statistics, there are 20,000 beggars in the city. Many of them are engaged in begging as a profession. It is estimated that there are 150,000 impoverished people. A few months ago, there were hundreds of flute players from the mountains and many ragged men and women and children playing accordions in the beggar groups. When the Allied forces first arrived in Rome, it was a great way to beg. British and American soldiers would generously donate lira notes at any time. Now that the large army has left, the music of the beggars has also disappeared. The few soldiers left in Rome see outstretched palms every day, and their hearts have hardened. A few months ago, a beggar earned hundreds of stars (lira) every day, which was not uncommon. Sometimes, they could even earn a thousand lira a day. Now, they cannot earn that much. An old woman, dressed well, looking like an impoverished aristocrat, still begs only on Fifth Avenue. Six months ago, she told benefactors about the Dharma. Now she speaks Italian, but most of the beggars in the city, such as women with disheveled hair and dirty faces, leading sick-looking children, continue to beg back and forth on the streets of Rome. Because it is too cold, they can no longer sit still for hours. Those beggars who are used to pretending to be silently grieving and in need of relief have mostly abandoned their posts. To foreigners, they mostly say in Italian: "Sir, please give us something." However, the most effective way to say it is an old man standing there, only shouting, "Starved to death, starved to death!"</p>
<h3>U.S. and Soviet Representatives Negotiate the Korean Issue in Seoul, the Trusteeship Period Will Be Shortened</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 16th] In accordance with the agreement of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers, the United States and the Soviet Union held a joint conference in Seoul. The Soviet delegation of 73 people arrived here by train from the Soviet-occupied area of ​​northern Korea in heavy snow today, and will work with the US delegation to revitalize Korea, so that 30 million Koreans who have just been liberated after 40 years of Japanese rule can restore their independence. US Major General Arnold personally went to Seoul Station to welcome them, and immediately accompanied Soviet Representative Lieutenant General Schtikoff and others to the Korean Hotel. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in the southern occupied area, then drove to visit him. In the afternoon, the officers of both parties first consulted to formulate the agenda. Tomorrow, the leaders of the two countries will hold a meeting at the Governor’s Office of Japan’s rule in Korea. According to Lieutenant General Hodge, because the Soviet representative proposed, the conference news will be released in a joint communique. The two occupied areas are bordered by the 38th parallel, so this artificial division has greatly increased economic problems. Both sides have specialized advisors, and the lineup is neat. Generally speaking, northern Korea is an industrial area and southern Korea is an agricultural area. According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, the first task should be to restore the economic foundation of Korea, and then discuss political issues. [United Press International, Washington, 16th] Officials from all walks of life here welcomed the State Department's announcement that the commanders of the US and Soviet occupation forces in Korea would meet soon. It is considered a good sign to reduce the boundaries within Korea. The general public is quite optimistic about the possibility that the first formal meeting between the US and the Soviet Union will enable the Joint Committee stipulated in the Moscow Conference to be established soon, and to adjust the administrative and economic affairs of the North and South as soon as possible. People close to the State Department said: At present, there is sufficient reason to believe that the plan to shorten the time limit in the Moscow communiqué stipulates that the United Nations trusteeship of Korea will be five years, and its term may be considerably shortened.</p>

<h3>Humility, Harmony, Pleasure, Perfection: A Sketch of the Second Consultation Conference of the Eastern-Style Grand Assembly</h3>
<p>— This newspaper’s Chongqing, 13th, Airmail News: By Pu De, out of touch with the times</p>
<p>The second meeting of the Political Consultative Conference was held at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 am on the 12th. Zhang Lan was absent due to illness, and Wang Xueting was late due to business. A total of 35 people attended, and President Sun Zhesheng continued to act as chairman.</p>
<p>The meeting began: Under the warm winter sunshine, the atmosphere was exceptionally harmonious. First, according to the agenda decided yesterday, both the government and the Communist Party reported on the origin of the Double Tenth Talks record.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi is Humble and Admirable</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Lizi modestly let Mr. Zhou Enlai start first. The atmosphere of courtesy kept the meeting harmonious from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The reporter sitting in the audience also lost the uneasy apprehension of the second half of yesterday's meeting.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai Eloquent and Moving</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai first said a few polite words, thanking the secretariat for letting him speak first. Then, he eloquently recounted the past eight years of negotiations between the two parties. He emphasized that "eight years ago, it was to stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan, and now it is to stop the civil war and build the country peacefully." Mr. Zhou Enlai's sincere tone and attitude won the praise of the whole audience. He naturally made people forget some unpleasant facts, so that this harmonious atmosphere could be maintained consistently.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's Sense of Security</p>
<p>Then, Shao Lizi added that he emphasized the sincerity of the two parties in negotiating, but also pointed out that there had been times in the past when the two parties held their own positions, causing the meeting to be interrupted several times. He announced that a negotiation record had been erased, because this time—the cessation of the conflict was due to the Communist Party's "sense of security" and no agreement had been reached. This is also the only reason why the conflict continued to exist and expand after the Double Tenth Agreement. Mr. Shao also politely said that this meeting should be attributed to Mr. Zhang Wenbai, who is currently busy with another negotiation. He made the greatest efforts and had the best achievements.</p>
<p>Sun Zhesheng Announces a Break</p>
<p>After the two parties finished reporting, the chairman announced a 15-minute break. During the break, next to the stove, there were piles of casual talk and laughter. People like Hitler would never believe that this was next to a conference table, especially in the National Government.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu Enters a Separate Room</p>
<p>At this time, Wang Yunwu, Chen Lifu, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming, and a group of five people entered a separate room to negotiate the candidates for the military investigation team.</p>
<p>After the break (passed the report on accepting Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai's negotiations on ceasing military conflict and restoring traffic) Shao Congen and Yu Jiaju successively spoke, saying: The negotiations have been held in a state of continuous progress, which is quite gratifying. At this time, Ye Jianying, who was about to go to Peiping to participate in the implementation of the tripartite consultation results, bid farewell to everyone.</p>
<p>Deng Yingchao Does Not Forget Women's Rights</p>
<p>Deng Yingchao then spoke, saying: Representatives of the annual investigation team should have female participation. At this time, everyone was chatting and laughing, as there were no formal matters to discuss. Finally, Mr. Wang Yunwu and other five people re-entered the venue. After the chairman took the list from Mr. Wang, he submitted it to the meeting for opinions. As a result, everyone unanimously agreed, and the meeting ended happily and perfectly.</p>
<p>This three-hour second meeting was indeed truly delightful. If yesterday's meeting was Western-style, today's meeting can be said to be purely Eastern-style. After all, China is a country of courtesy.</p>
<h3>American General Serving to Revive China: Chennault in Chongqing to Inspect China's Business Transportation by Air</h3>
<p>[Compiled by Our Newsroom] This reporter was honored to be present at a press conference at General Randall's residence on the 15th, where I saw Lieutenant General Chennault, who had a resolute face and youthful spirit. This is Chennault's second visit to China, which can also be said to be a return to familiar ground. His mood was exceptionally warm and cordial, making the reporters feel very comfortable with him.</p>
<p>As soon as we sat down next to Lieutenant General Chennault, we began to raise the questions that were on the minds of the reporters, mainly two points: one was about the new developments in the American commercial aviation industry in the Pacific, and the other was about their personal work plans in China.</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, Chennault told the reporters, "American aircraft manufacturing is becoming more and more innovative every day. As far as I know, aircraft that are more than twice as fast as the B-29 have already been successfully created."</p>
<p>Flying Time Will Be Shortened</p>
<p>"Two weeks ago, I flew across the Pacific, and it only took me fifty-six hours!" He couldn't hide his joy, and at the same time, he adopted a very lighthearted posture, as if he were re-enjoying this kind of pleasure in the high sky.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the American side has decided that by the end of this year, at the latest, the flying time across the Pacific will definitely be shortened to an astonishing degree. At that time, it will definitely be reduced to thirty-six hours due to the use of a high-speed aircraft that has already been successfully tested.</p>
<p>He also made a prediction (and said with conviction): By the end of March, Xunmei Airlines will resume commercial flights across the Pacific. He also said that other airlines also have news of launching similar routes, which may be implemented by the end of June.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Chennault has a keen interest in Chinese affairs. In addition to expressing his willingness to work in China, he also mentioned concrete views on the ongoing Political Consultative Conference and other aspects, which can be seen in the reports of the US Information Service, saving me a little ink. The general idea of what he said that day was as follows: "My visit to China this time is prompted by my personal desire to investigate China's commercial and transportation situation."</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Chennault then emphasized that his return to China "is indeed a private matter" and has no official connection with the Chinese and American governments. His interest lies only in investigating the whole of China to see if he can still be of service in the work of China's revival. Because for the past eight years, his work has been in the area of destruction.</p>
<p>Estimated Duration of Three Months: "My visit to China this time does not represent any American company or organization, but after I complete my investigation, it may be helpful to some American business organizations." He expects the scope of this investigation to include possible commercial developments, the current commercial situation, and the aviation transportation situation. The required time will be three months.</p>
<p>He is determined to investigate the Chinese valleys south of Beiping and has no intention of going to North China or the Northeast Provinces for the time being. However, if there is an opportunity, he would very much like to investigate the North in March.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Chennault retired from the Army on October 31 last year and is still wearing his Army Air Corps uniform. When he left China to return to the United States, it was only two days before the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. He said that at that time, the Fourteenth Air Force had completed its mission in China.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Chennault then discussed the current transportation problems, the urgent need to develop the agricultural economy, and the damage to roads and rivers. He said that it will take considerable time to solve the various problems. And this work is very difficult. In order to help China, he believes that he would rather take on peacetime tasks than bear military responsibilities. As for his future plans, it all depends on the results of his investigation of China's trade situation in peacetime.</p>
<p>Recognizes Consultative Conference as a Good Opportunity for Unification</p>
<p>Now, he is meeting with his military and business friends in Chongqing. As soon as he arrived in Chongqing, he had dinner with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the same day. He said that Chiang is a personal friend of his. He also said, "We did not discuss official business. I am very happy for the Chairman's happiness. I congratulate him on his current work to complete the unification of China!"</p>
<p>Next, Lieutenant General Chennault expressed his personal views. He believes that the current Political Consultative Conference "is indeed a good opportunity on the right path to achieve unification. China is necessary to be able to take on the task of a world power."</p>
<p>He also said that the American people "are very concerned about China, but they still lack a full understanding of the Chinese situation."</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Chennault is scheduled to go to Kunming the day after tomorrow (the 18th), then return to Chongqing, and then set off on a trip to investigate the situation in various places. At that time, he will be accompanied by an interpreter. Now, the US Air Transport Command, the Chinese Air Force Transport Command, and China National Aviation Corporation have all expressed their willingness to provide aircraft for his travel.</p>
<p>US Marines Visit Chinese Stage: After the arrival of the US military in North China, in order to express welcome, China continuously performed dramas on the Beiping stage for several days to thank the US Marines who arrived in the ancient capital to receive Japanese equipment, disarm the Japanese military, and send Japanese soldiers back to their country. The image shows: US Marines enter the backstage to see how Chinese Peking opera actors put on makeup.</p>
<h3>Will "Big Bear" Be Unbeatable in the World in Twenty-Five Years? New Prediction of Soviet Strength</h3>
<p>— Original Article Published in American Common Sense Magazine, Translated by Our Newsroom</p>
<p>In the buzzing sound of hundreds of computers, the future strength of the Soviet Union is being estimated and calculated. According to the most precise population estimates, in twenty-five years, in terms of population, the strength of the Soviet Union will surpass any political group of countries in Europe.</p>
<p>Although all countries have guns and ammunition, the victory or defeat of modern warfare is determined by a large number of troops. When financial and material resources are exhausted, the country with the largest population has a great advantage. The Soviet Union knows this best. The Soviet Union suffered greater losses in this war than any other country in Europe, but it was still able to fight the enemy to the end with frontline units. The Soviet Union will continue to increase its population at an extraordinary rate in the next generation, while the population of other European countries will remain stagnant. At present, the population of Western and Northern Europe is decreasing, and it is expected that this decrease will continue. Even before the war, there were no signs of population growth there. The average rate of population decline in Denmark, Finland, Hungary, and Scotland is 10%, in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Latvia, Norway, and Switzerland is between 10% and 20%, and in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany before Hitler's rule, and Austria, is over 20%.</p>
<p>Soviet Population Will Increase to 250 Million in Twenty-Five Years</p>
<p>According to a recent report by the de Gaulle government, if the French population continues to decline at the current rate, it will decrease from the current 40 million to 25 million by the end of this century. According to population experts, in fifty years, the French population will decrease by 7 to 8 million.</p>
<p>Excluding the Soviet Union, the future is brighter for the entire Europe. Setting aside the impact of the war, by 1970, the population of Europe should increase by 18 million. In other words, the total population in 1940 was 399 million, and it will increase to 417 million by 1970. But almost all of these population increases are in countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Whether population trends can be changed by policies is a question that must be raised. Although the Nazi Party used prizes, loans, and so-called patriotic enthusiasm to encourage childbirth, it did not succeed in raising Germany's birth rate. Countries that are unwilling to confine women to the home to be solely responsible for childbirth will probably encounter even greater difficulties in this regard.</p>
<p>Compared with other parts of Europe, the Soviet population clearly has a straight upward trend and shows signs of continued growth. Since 1900, the Soviet population has increased by 55%, including the 26 million people lost in World War I and the Communist Revolution. According to statisticians, although the Soviet Union's war losses were very large, the Soviet population will increase from 174 million in 1940 to 251 million in 1970. This increase alone will be greater than the entire population of Germany in twenty-five years. By that time, the Soviet population will be 26 million more than the entire population of Western and Northern Europe!</p>
<p>In estimating the strength of a country, the number of population is measured by the number of army divisions, not by the total population of the country. Although the elderly and women can be driven to join the battle in the final stages, the decisive factor in the victory or defeat of a war is the young people aged fifteen to thirty-four. This is unanimously recognized by all military leaders. Therefore, when estimating the strength of European countries in the next generation, the age of the population must also be taken into account.</p>
<p>The Number of Young People in the Soviet Union is Equal to the Total of England, France, Germany, and Italy</p>
<p>In this respect, we find that the Soviet Union still occupies the primary position. Since 1900, the Soviet Union has continued to supplement the ranks of the Red Army with 6 million young people of conscription age, while Germany has only supplemented 200,000 young soldiers. This means that the Soviet Union has increased by 400 divisions of troops, while Germany has only increased by 12 divisions. In the future, the military-age manpower of the Soviet Union will become more abundant. According to estimates by Princeton University population expert Kirk, by 1970, the number of military-age young people in the Soviet Union will increase by 13 million. This increase alone is already larger than all the young troops in Germany within the borders of 1937. Kirk also predicted: "In 1970, the number of young people aged fifteen to thirty-four in the Soviet Union will be equal to the sum of all the same young people in England, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Romania. These countries are all the most densely populated countries in Europe."</p>
<p>Even if the Soviet Union's war losses are taken into account, the situation will not change much, because in other parts of Europe, the war losses are almost equally significant. Some military experts have determined that after the war tends to be mechanized, the difference in population is relatively unimportant. A small number of people with sufficient equipment can rival a large number of people with incomplete weapons. After this war, these theories can no longer be established. People really cannot attack tanks and planes with bare hands, but as long as there is a minimum of technological progress, the majority of the population will show its strength. The population that can supply unlimited resources can make up for the lack of equipment.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has made rapid progress in technology during this war. In another twenty-five years, the Soviet Union's military equipment will undoubtedly be on par with any country in the world. The Soviet Union's recent announcement that all young people in the country will receive extensive compulsory military training in the coming years is even more worthy of credence.</p>
<p>The increase or decrease in population seems to be closely related to technological progress. When mechanical engineering was introduced, the population increased accordingly. This is mostly due to improved hygiene, medical progress, and reduced mortality.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union follows the population pattern of the past few centuries, it will take a long time to reach the point where the population begins to decrease. By that time, the Soviet population may be equal to or even greater than the total population of the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>The Strength of Future Countries Depends on the Degree of Industrialization</p>
<p>However, we must know that the Soviet Union is also adjacent to densely populated Asia. If we do not keep this fact in mind, we cannot consider the Soviet population in relation to Europe and get the whole picture.</p>
<p>In the countries of the East, if the experts' estimates are correct, we will see some significant population increases that will affect the balance of power in the entire world. This region, with the exception of Japan, has been relatively unaffected by the Western industrial revolution. India, under British rule, has slightly trended towards industrialization, which is reflected in the population increase. However, the countries of the East now seem to be ready to accept Western mechanical civilization, and it will not be long before the increase in population will break the records in human history. Just looking at the progress India has made in the past forty years, we can imagine its future development. In the past forty years, India's population has increased from 284 million to the current 388 million. Japan's progress is manifested in short-term industrialization and the accompanying increase in population. In 1870, Japan's population was 35 million. By 1940, this number had doubled. The last population survey showed a population of 75.1 million. After the outbreak of the war, this rapid population increase did not stop.</p>
<p>Looking at the Asian continent, based on the population growth in the past ten years, China's population will increase from the current 400 million to 609 million in 1990. During the same period, India's population will increase from 388 million to 701 million. These figures are alarming, but they are all based on the population growth rate in the past. If Asia can fully implement industrialization, then the population growth rate may be even greater. If the population of China and India increases as fast as Japan, then in fifty years, the population of China and Southeast Asia may be equal to the total population of the world today.</p>
<p>Even if we estimate based on the past population growth rate, when the Soviet Union's population increases to 328 million in 1990, the population of China and Southeast Asia will be 1.678 billion. This means that in fifty years, the Soviet Union's population will be exceeded by the countries of the East by a ratio of five to one. However, this prediction of population increase is based on the premise that the countries of the East are industrialized. As for the strength of their national power, it must be determined by the degree of industrialization. But one thing is certain: once the situation in Europe is stabilized, the Soviet Union's attention will shift to the East. Judging from the results of the population estimates, that is inevitable. But one thing is certain: once the situation is stabilized, the Soviet Union's attention will shift to the East. Judging from the results of the population estimates, that is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Hitler Needs a Mistress, the Mistress Needs a Dog</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, Hitler really deserved what he got. The Eve Braun he loved was originally a bad woman.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, please see: An American intelligence officer found the following passage in her diary in 1935: -</p>
<p>I stood outside Carlton for three hours because he was buying flowers for Shina and wanted to take her to dinner. I must see it clearly... I need to buy more sleeping pills now. At that time, at least I will be dizzy... According to Hoffman, he now has another woman, her name is Hua Ge'er, her legs... legs...</p>
<p>When he said he loved me, he was as serious as if he were making some kind of promise, but he never fulfilled all the promises... I just wrote him a letter... If I don't receive a reply by ten o'clock, I will decide to swallow fifteen sleeping pills and sleep forever... Li, the weather is good, I, the wife of a very important person in Germany and the world, have to sit at home, looking at the sky out the window...</p>
<p>"If only I could have a dog" (translated from "Time")</p>
<h3>The Judgment Day is Here, the Judgment is Quick</h3>
<p>The war criminals who manufactured wars, murdered or injured the Allied forces and civilians have now bowed their heads to justice and are being judged for the crimes they deserve. Christ said: "The day of final judgment is near, repent as soon as possible!" However, time is merciless! It's too late, it's too late. Look! All peace-loving and just people in the world are silent witnesses! Are they not focusing their eyes and fingers on these war criminals? (Cartoon by Lamberd of the "Philadelphia Record")</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Foreigners Discussing Chinese Affairs</h3>
<p>Foreigners discussing Chinese affairs are sometimes very alarming for the country, but at other times, it inevitably feels like there's a disconnect. The New York Times recently published an article by Sir Frederick Whyte, titled "The Challenge to the West from the East." In it, regarding the situation in China, he stated: "I maintain that if the United Nations, especially the United States, can agree to allow the Chinese people to decide their own government according to the path unique to them, China will reach its own conclusions more quickly and effectively—even if it means paying the price of some bloodshed." Sir Frederick Whyte also said: "The same principle should apply to the whole of Asia today, including India." We have not yet seen the original text of Sir Frederick Whyte's remarks; however, Reuters has extracted these two points and disseminated them widely, as if the Chinese people are now eager to "challenge" the United States, which is a strange thing to say! While we should be grateful for Sir Frederick Whyte's concern for China, we feel that his arguments necessitate further discussion.</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Whyte's argument, according to him, is based on the perspective of Asians; he seems to be speaking on behalf of Asians, including the Chinese. However, as far as the situation in China is concerned, Sir Frederick Whyte's argument aims to subtly encourage the early withdrawal of American troops from China, which is quite different from the US's national policy. Disseminating this view in the United States is intended to influence American public opinion, thereby revising its national policy: once this is achieved, it will not only affect the national policy of the United States but also affect the development of the Far Eastern situation. Sir Frederick Whyte, as an Englishman, uses the guise of discussing Asian issues from the "Asian perspective," especially the "Chinese perspective" regarding the situation in China, in order to strengthen the power of his argument. Therefore, we Chinese people, especially when he discusses the situation in China, should express our attitude.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people, understanding the mission of the American troops in China and the policy of the American government toward China, did not have any demand or hope for the early withdrawal of American troops. The American troops, in the spirit of allied friendship, were assisting the Chinese government in carrying out the tasks of accepting surrender and repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war in the Chinese war zone. The American troops taking on this mission in China was not only assisting China but also carrying out tasks related to their own interests. At least at this stage, before this mission is accomplished, the Chinese people have no demands or hopes for the withdrawal of American troops.</p>
<p>Second, the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that the US policy toward China is not to interfere in internal affairs but to support China in establishing a strong, unified, and democratic nation. President Truman's recent statement reiterated the US's traditional policy toward China. The efforts of General Hurley and Marshal Marshall, while implementing US policy, were seen by the Chinese people as a democratic and advanced nation assisting China in establishing a strong, unified, and democratic nation in the spirit of neighborly friendship. We feel grateful for this kindness, not resentment, and there is even less talk of demanding the early withdrawal of American troops.</p>
<p>The above two points are the sincere feelings of the Chinese people. But we do not deny another fact, that since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, because American troops quickly arrived at the major coastal ports of China and assisted the National Government in undertaking the task of accepting surrender, it may have hindered the plans of certain armed political groups to expand their power from the Japanese invaders, thereby creating public opinion demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. If their plan succeeds, without American troops seeing their actions, they can do whatever they want. Even after an agreement to cease conflict, they can still break the agreement and attack, still seize cities and land, without being verified by allies. In fact, the sincere wish of the Chinese people at this time is that order and stability are the most important things, so they do not want to see political disputes. The efforts of the United States in China do not involve interference in internal affairs and have a stabilizing influence, which is quite commendable. We remember that in the early stages of the War of Resistance, these elements had already advocated that China should not be close to the United States. Later, due to changes in the international situation, they proposed the slogan of "democracy" in the hope of gaining US support. Currently, because the US is fair and their plans have failed, they have turned to anti-American rhetoric, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. All of this is a political conspiracy of a part of the Chinese people. If Sir Frederick Whyte considers the arguments of these people as the general intention of the Chinese people and bases his arguments on this, it is too superficial.</p>
<p>Even from the standpoint of world peace, if the United States does not intervene in Chinese affairs, it will cause very worrying consequences. From the British standpoint, considering the interests of Britain itself from a more distant perspective, this is also not beneficial. World War II originated from the September 18th Incident in Shenyang. Stimson's proposals did not receive the support of the West, and eventually, the sparks in the corner of Northeast China became uncontrollable. This was a mistake in British policy. Today, in the aftermath of the Axis collapse, considering the international situation, there is no room for further mistakes to affect the overall situation. Mankind should look at the big picture and not be confined to the current situation, lest future troubles be left behind. Let us think about how much unexploded gunpowder is contained in Asia today, from Turkey and Iran all the way to East Asia. The situation in Iran is already very serious, and Turkey is also threatened. We cannot allow this situation to spread. China, after a long war of resistance, has entered the stage of national reconstruction and needs the assistance of democratic countries with the same ideals for national reconstruction. The United States has sacrificed countless lives to support its policy in the Far East. Now that the war has stopped, the international order still needs to be rebuilt. In our efforts to build the country, the goodwill and support of our allies will be forever etched in the hearts of the Chinese people. In the efforts to rebuild the international order, allies must be of one mind and abandon their own opinions to jointly seek progress. In such an atomic age, the interests of the world, the interests of mankind, should far outweigh the interests of a single country. Certain words and deeds, from the perspective of a single country or from the perspective of national interests, may be beneficial; but from the perspective of the world, they may be harmful. Not only should arguments like those of Sir Frederick Whyte be treated with caution, but the Chinese themselves should also look ahead and behind when speaking, and not be limited to temporary and local views.</p>

<h3>Stock Market Rebounds: Many Exchange Money for Currency; Unified B Bonds See New High</h3>
<p>Hot Red</p>
<p>Yesterday's market continued to be mediocre. Major players were slightly hesitant, and although retail investors made purchases, the bond market surged wildly. Those eager for quick profits returned to bonds, weakening the upward momentum. Many floating positions had to be liquidated around noon. Although banks continued to absorb, they didn't provide much help, making it difficult for high prices to last. Early morning trading was flat, with prices holding above the previous closing price for quite some time. Later, as people exchanged money for currency and sold off, supply and demand gradually became unsustainable. Around noon, with the liquidation of floating positions, the price gradually fell from 8.79 million to below 8.6 million. In the early afternoon, the price hovered around 8.6 million, then rose to above 8.7 million due to next-day settlement. Spot prices were also dragged up to around 8.65 million. The result was a slight drop of 2,000 compared to the previous close. Decorated gold was quoted at 93,000, silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars remained around 450. The informal overnight loan rate remained stable, with supply and demand roughly equal. Interest rates ranged from about 8% to 11%.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday, the US dollar saw eager buying for arbitrage, coupled with absorption by a certain bank, which narrowed the premium against gold from 605 yuan to 600 yuan per ten taels. It opened flat, then reached 1450 yuan due to significant bank absorption. The process was very smooth. Around noon, it slightly followed the decline in gold prices, and the market remained flat afterwards. The result was a slight drop of 6 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar forwards rose to 475 due to Hong Kong Electric's application for currency (Old Hong Kong dollar 475 yuan against Legal Tender 10,000 yuan, equivalent to a Hong Kong exchange rate of 210.53), but remained weak. Old issues fell another 5 yuan, new issues fell 3 yuan. Australian pounds were bought at 2.5 yuan against the US dollar, and rupees at 24 fen, with a 10% markup for resale.</p>
<p>Government Bonds:</p>
<p>Yesterday, news that the Ministry of Finance would handle the principal and interest of various government bonds issued before the 30th year of the Republic held by people in recovered areas separately greatly boosted morale, and various expectations became more vivid. Class C bonds immediately broke through the 1400 yuan mark in the morning, and various sources of floating capital joined in one after another. Short sellers also urgently covered their positions. For a time, buying sentiment pervaded, and the price broke through two major levels of 1500 and 1600 yuan. After reaching a high price of 1665 yuan, some physical goods flowed out, causing a temporary pullback of 100 yuan. However, new bulls continued to join in, and at noon, the price again broke through the 1700 yuan level, reaching a new peak of 1765 yuan before slightly consolidating. The result was an increase of 500 yuan or more for Class A, B, D, and E bonds compared to the previous close. Class C bonds only rose 380 yuan due to the excessively high base price. Floating capital clearly chose cheaper options, and holders of miscellaneous bonds took advantage of the situation to raise prices, leading to this outcome.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks:</p>
<p>Trading on the market didn't break away from old practices and still opened higher. There were also several rallies during the day, but prices were too high, and buyers were wary. Yong Yarn saw 1440 yuan, Meiya 990 yuan, Xinguang 80 yuan, Jingfu 77 yuan, Qinxing 71 yuan before gradually pulling back. At noon, there was even more panic, with almost all stocks closing at lower prices. The result was a drop of 100 yuan for Yong Yarn, 60 yuan for Meiya, 2.5 yuan for Jingfu, 2 yuan for Xinguang, and 1 yuan for Qinxing compared to the previous close. Various unpopular stocks also saw lower prices again.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks:</p>
<p>The overall trend was influenced by Chinese stocks, rising first and then falling. In the end, the selling side prevailed. This was a natural pullback after many days of sharp rises. Yi Yarn fell steadily from 4100 yuan, Jardine Matheson from 10200 yuan, British American Tobacco from 5400 yuan, Yi Beer from 1480 yuan, Paper from 1350 yuan, Steel from 1850 yuan, and Asia from 1550 yuan. At noon closing, Yi Yarn fell 150 yuan, Yi Beer rose 50 yuan, Paper fell 100 yuan, and Jardine Matheson rose 450 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>3,000 Tons of US Cotton Arrives in Shanghai; Large Quantities of Flour Loaded for Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>The US ship *Rowling Cyork* (transliteration), carrying a large quantity of cotton, arrived in Shanghai from Seattle yesterday and docked at the Bailianjing Wharf. In addition to 3,000 tons of US cotton, the ship also carried 3,000 tons of relief flour, or more than 140,000 bags. After the cotton is unloaded, 3,000 tons of flour will be loaded in Shanghai, combining with the original 3,000 tons of flour, for a total of 6,000 tons to be transported to Qinhuangdao for distribution to North China and the nine eastern provinces. The *Wilfred Müller*, managed by the UK Far East Shipping Office, is also loading a large quantity of flour, 148,000 bags, and 1,000 tons of used clothing in Shanghai for transport to Qinhuangdao. In the coming days, large quantities of flour will be transported to the nine eastern provinces and Tianjin-Beijing for relief.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Rise, Oil Prices Pull Back Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gains and losses were mixed in the grain market. Rice prices remained firm due to rising prices in production areas. *Jingxian* rice and *Yuan* rice both continued to rise by 200-300 yuan, but the market showed signs of fatigue at the close. Flour remained stable, with a slight increase of 100 yuan. Edible oil prices remained unchanged due to inactivity outside the market, and local observers anticipated a slight pullback of several hundred to a thousand yuan. Soybean transactions were scarce, with slight price adjustments. Raw peanuts were firm, and sesame prices were stable. Soybean cake also pulled back by nearly 100 yuan. The liquor market was very active, rising another 500 yuan and showing a firm trend.</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Guoliang*, *Guoan*, and *Guoping* ships, towing three iron barges, arrived yesterday carrying 33,085 bags of rice from Wuhu. This rice is all public grain from the Grain Management Office.</p>
<h3>Anthracite Coal Blocks Alone Rise</h3>
<p>Sales of white coal blocks and briquettes remained sluggish in coal shops. With the establishment of the People's Livelihood Coal Management Office, flat-price coal sales will soon be implemented, so buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, making transactions even scarcer. Only white coal fines and coal seams are being traded. However, anthracite coal blocks are selling well, and the source and inventory of anthracite coal blocks are insufficient, prompting sellers to collectively raise prices, leading to continuous price increases in recent days.</p>
<h3>Tea Cores In Short Supply</h3>
<p>Red Edge tea cores, most popular with wholesalers, have been exceptionally favored by Jiangbei wholesalers recently. However, the inventory of this type of tea on the market is about to be exhausted, making it akin to trying to get fish from a tree. As for other types, sales continue to keep pace with supply, so buying sentiment remains spread throughout the market, and transactions show no signs of decreasing. Prices are uniformly trending upward, and the base is also being rapidly consolidated.</p>
<h3>Rayon Reaches New High, Silk Prices Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market opened at 1,020,000 yuan at the No. 120 Tianjin Bridge, gradually rising to 1,070,000 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it reached 1,090,000 yuan, setting a new record high, but transactions were very rare, few and far between. Warehouse receipts were priced at 825,000 yuan, with the final bid at 860,000 yuan, 230,000 yuan lower than spot prices. The prospect of warehouse receipts being released has been delayed, so there is no upward momentum. Front market merchants then lowered prices again. Factory conditions were flat, with some transactions among counterparts. Yesterday's silk market saw little interest, and prices became unsustainable. Meiya quilt covers were priced at 690,000 yuan per hundred, and Dacheng Gebi crepe at 1,960 yuan per yard. Rayon prices were stable. Minsheng brocade was priced at 9,800 yuan per piece, and Huajin crepe at 950 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Wire Nails Firm</h3>
<p>The brisk sales of wire nails have persisted for months, mainly due to the diligent purchasing by customers from various regions. Recently, the Hankou wholesalers have been actively buying, and branch nails have been almost completely bought up. Because factory production is very slow, there is a risk of shortages. The current selling price per keg is 382,000 yuan for 3-point nails, 72,000 yuan for 4-point nails, 62,000 yuan for 5-point nails, 52,000 yuan for 6-point nails, 38,000 yuan for 1-inch nails, 33,000 yuan for 1.5-inch nails, 26,000 yuan for 2-inch nails, and 25,000 yuan for 2.5-inch nails, 24,000 for 3-inch nails. Due to the easy trade of wire nails, its raw material, 2-point Yang silver, has also risen accordingly, and is currently sold at 325,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Becomes More Stable; 16-Count Fine Yarn Rises 50-60,000</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned more stable yesterday. Because the various counts of yarn sold by the Spinning and Construction Company could not be picked up immediately, customers and weaving factories who were eager to use them had to search for spot goods, so people's minds turned to stability. 10- and 12-count yarn recovered about 10,000, 16-count yarn rose 20,000. The price of fine yarn rose by 50-60,000 because the bidding price of the Spinning and Construction Company was not as low as generally expected. The Spinning and Construction Company continued to dump a considerable amount, mostly dragged in by counterparts and cloth factories.</p>
<h3>Association Handles Registration on Behalf of Members; Member List Must Be Made, Fees Paid Directly to Bureau</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Since the Social Affairs Bureau organized industrial and commercial registration, those who went to collect forms and register were very enthusiastic, with a large number of people lining up in long queues, similar to the rice and oil milling scenes in the past. It is heard that the bureau has few forms left and is reprinting them. Those who collect forms in bulk through various industry associations are ordered to make a list of members before they are issued. The fees paid for filing should originally be paid to the municipal treasury, but the bureau has simplified the procedures and has agreed with the municipal bank that the bureau will directly handle the fees and remit them to the treasury the next day.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Falls</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, New York, 16th] Yesterday, the cotton market opened, and prices fell by 8-10 pounds due to the influence of price limit news. Later, with sellers stagnant, the market price quickly stabilized, and securities showed activity again. At the same time, news of improved labor unrest led to competitive covering of short positions. Subsequently, due to profit-taking sales, the market trend turned calm. Prices initially fell by 3 pounds at noon, with no rise or fall afterwards. There was little activity in the afternoon, and market prices changed very little.</p>

<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The sugar market has become looser again, but Xinghua red and coarse sand are still in short supply, and 4-5 white is still very scarce.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Melon seeds are flat, the date market is mild and may see a slight decline, the market has not opened yet and is inactive, vermicelli has also entered a stable trend, and is unlikely to rise again for a while. However, pickles are still selling well, and dried bamboo shoots are also stable and harmonious, preventing a slight pullback in the coming days.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The market is showing signs of weakness due to the continuous dumping by the China Textile Construction Company.</p>
<p>Knitted Goods: Yesterday's market saw a mix of rises and falls. 32-count socks fell sharply yesterday morning as the gold price recovered, because they had risen too much last month. Undershirts alone continued to rise due to many parties intending to do well, with people fighting over them, resulting in continuous price increases and no goods available. However, health shirts and cotton shirts are less popular due to seasonal factors, so prices are stagnant. The wind of rising foreign paper has been curbed, because the price had risen excessively in anticipation of the rise, and there was no shortage of virtual price increases. People's minds were unstable, and customers were taking a wait-and-see attitude. In recent days, goods have often followed the trend, and foreign paper is no exception. Before the exchange rate is set and the source is difficult to predict, it cannot be discussed according to common sense.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: Yesterday's market conditions were unchanged, calm and peaceful, and transactions turned sparse.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: The trend is stable, transactions are idle, and price fluctuations are minimal. The afternoon saw a calm market. Huacheng Company will distribute the first batch of Da Jinshu cigarettes starting tomorrow, and other small cigarette factories will also distribute goods, it is said.</p>

The boat carries more than 100 troop members and their families, and each person only spent 30,000 yuan. It will arrive in the port in the middle of next month.</p>
<h3>The Complete Picture and Dynamics of the National Ritual and Music Museum</h3>
<p>— By Wu Jia</p>
<p>The National Ritual and Music Museum was established in May of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) by order of the Supreme National Defense Commission, and it was affiliated with the Ministry of Education. (The Music Education Committee originally established by the Ministry of Education was merged into the museum.) It was prepared and established by Gu Yuxiu, then Deputy Minister of Education, and Lu Qian, then a member of the Political Participation Council. The museum was located on Zhongshan Road in Beipei, Chongqing. The museum was organized as follows: under the director, there were three groups: General Affairs, Ritual System, and Music Classics. Each group had one director, a number of researchers, and a number of administrative personnel. The researchers were divided into four levels: compilers, reviewers, associate reviewers, and assistant reviewers. The administrative personnel were divided into two levels: group members and assistant group members. Since its establishment, the museum has been in existence for more than two years and has made many contributions to the establishment of rituals and music. Among the most prominent ones are the holding of ritual system discussion meetings (held at the museum on August 27 of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943) to discuss the draft ritual system prepared by the Ministry of Interior in the 27th year of the Republic (1938)), ritual system discussion meetings (held at Beibei Hot Springs on October 3 of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943) to discuss and approve the draft of the Five Rituals), and ritual system review meetings (held at the museum on May 18 of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) to discuss the issue of mourning attire); reviewing and approving national daily life etiquette and school etiquette; publishing "Ritual and Music," "Local Customs," "Victory Song Selections," "Marching Song Selections," and "Kunqu Selections"; collecting folk songs, conducting folk customs surveys, and providing wedding guidance. The work of the museum is carried out as follows: the General Affairs Group handles the daily general affairs of the museum; the work guidelines set by the Ritual System and Music Classics Groups are based on collecting, investigating, compiling, revising, and practicing, and experts are separately hired to preside over and carry out the work. However, it is said that because the scale of the museum is small and the national treasury is strained during the war, the business expenses obtained are very small, so it is difficult to concentrate talents and promote work. The museum is currently focusing its efforts on smaller-scale work. In terms of ritual system, it focuses on the collection and research of folk customs. In terms of music classics, it focuses on the review and publication of military songs, victory songs, and music teaching materials. It only seeks to cultivate without asking for harvest, in order to lay the foundation for future work. When the capital is returned, the funds and talents will be replenished, and the work will have new developments. The first director of the museum was Gu Yuxiu, who resigned in the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). The current director is Wang Dong. Lu Qian is the director of the Ritual System Group, Yang Yinliu is the director of the Music Classics Group, and Yang Zhongzi and 15 others have been hired as researchers at all levels.

<p>The New Sixth Army began shipping out to the Northeast yesterday to take over defense. The defense here will be temporarily taken over by the 207th Division of the Youth Expeditionary Force. The advance troops of the division had arrived in this city a week ago, led by the advance commander (the division's education director) Liu Shaofeng and the regiment commander Zhang Yuequn. Division Commander Luo Youlun led the entire officers and soldiers of the division headquarters and arrived last night.</p>
<p>Full of Spirit and Strict Discipline: The officers and soldiers of the division are full of spirit and strict discipline and are one of the first divisions of our youth army to complete training. University students account for two-tenths of the soldiers in the division, high school students account for four-tenths, and the rest are junior high school students. Seven-tenths of the soldiers are from the Northwest provinces and cities, two-tenths are from Yunnan, and only one-tenth are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They gathered in Kunming in December of the year before last and began receiving American-style training in January of last year. In just one year, the soldiers' combat education has been fully completed. They are now receiving further officer education.</p>
<p>Departed from Yunnan and Traveled for Three Months: The division was ordered to depart for Shanghai on October 14 of last year. They traveled east by boat from Kunming to Changsha, and then to Shanghai via Hankou, taking three months. The division selected outstanding personnel from among the students to organize a "Troop Police Corps" to correct the troop's military discipline. For every county and town passed, they distributed printed forms and handed them over to local leaders. If there were any soldiers harassing or illegal incidents, they could be truthfully reported. The division headquarters severely punished those who violated military discipline, and the law-abiding spirit of the entire division officers and soldiers is also a model for the national army. Therefore, when they arrived in Shanghai via Hankou, the division received a commendation telegram from Commander-in-Chief He, praising them as a model army of China.</p>

<h3>The High Court Criminal Division Continues to Try Traitors</h3>
<p>Shi Xikun: The High Court Criminal Division tried two cases of traitors yesterday morning. The first case was Shi Xikun. Shi is 43 years old, from Nantong, and lives at 2030 Linqing Road, Yangshupu. He opened Wantaifu and Xintaixiang hardware stores. He worked as a foreman and translator at Tongxing Yarn Factory and Meihua Dyeing and Weaving Factory. This case was reported by the Youth League and handed over to the military police for transfer to the court. At 9:30 yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun interrogated him. He first asked about his age, hometown, family property, and then asked when he served as the chief secret agent at the Japanese consulate, how he described arresting Li Xiaolong, who set fire to the Shanghai warehouse, and how he prohibited citizens from hanging the national flag in the Daxi Road area. The criminal stubbornly denied everything. Then the witness Shen Qingnian testified that he was a colleague of Shi's when he worked at the Meihua factory, and that Shi was a translator, and he did not know the other circumstances. At this point, the court ordered a detailed investigation, and the remaining witnesses would be summoned next time. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Han Shaolin: The second case was Han Shaolin. Han is 20 years old, from Tianjin, and has no address in Shanghai. He was recruited by the Japanese in Tianjin in May of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) and sent to Shanghai. After completing naval training, he was assigned to the Nanjing base team as a signalman. After the enemy surrendered, he was disbanded and impersonated a military policeman with a wooden naval license, swindling and cheating and was arrested. The court argued that he could not afford to hire a defender and would conduct further interrogation after a lawyer was appointed by the court. The High Court also scheduled to try three cases of traitors.

It has sent personnel to investigate in four directions for several days and has obtained many clues about the inside story of the case. It is scheduled to summon Shu Yueqiao, a retired worker of the company, today to inquire about everything. It is heard that Mr. Ruan Zhongyu is responsible for the interrogation.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Carrying Overweight Luggage on Two Railways: Must Be Handed Over for Station Transport</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, in order to rectify order, have had to restrict the weight of luggage carried by passengers. A notice was previously issued stating that the weight of luggage carried by passengers should not exceed 40 kilograms for first class, 30 kilograms for second class, and 20 kilograms for third and fourth class. However, recently, a few passengers have been carrying overweight luggage onto the train, which has disrupted order and resulted in lost luggage. The railway bureau has now issued a special notice to passengers that in the future, overweight luggage must be handed over to the station for transport to maintain order on the train. To avoid lost luggage, the railway is changing the luggage tags to thick paper tags and small cloth strips, indicating the luggage number and the names of the starting and ending stations, and tying them to the luggage to prevent errors and losses.</p>
<p>Tourist Bus Planned: The Transportation Department of the North China Railway Management Committee is currently planning to organize tourist buses.

<h3>Housing Rental Dispute in Hua'an Fang: Housing Management Committee Determines Solution; Chen Shiquan Reports on Work Overview</h3>
<p>The Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee, in order to increase work efficiency, and Chen Shiquan, the concurrent Director of the Committee, paid close attention to the incident of over a hundred residents of Hua'an Fang on North Zhejiang Road suffering forced eviction and appealing for justice from all walks of life, to ensure fair handling and resolve the dispute. A sixth committee meeting was held yesterday, attended by Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court; Pan Xulun, Accountant; Ge Kexin, Acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Feng Youzhen, President of the Central News Agency; and representatives from the Garrison Headquarters. Director Chen reported on strengthening the committee's policy and the statistics of accepted cases. Since the establishment of the committee 50 days ago, 193 cases have been resolved through mediation and coordination between the two parties. These cases can be roughly divided into six categories: recovery for self-use, request for lease, request for eviction, reporting of illegal fees, illegal occupation of houses, and setting rent.</p>
<p>Thorough Discussion: In the handling of cases, the committee, concerning similar housing disputes to that of Hua'an Fang, has determined the lease event, and after referring to the actual situation in Shanghai and based on legal perspectives, conducted a thorough discussion. Therefore, whenever encountering such cases, it should comply with Chairman Chiang's instructions on people's livelihood, as well as Mayor Qian's aim to stabilize people's residence and protect the rights and interests of owners, and strictly crack down on the occupation of residential houses. For pre-war tenants requesting to continue leasing, houses previously rented to others by the enemy and puppets, and tenants who obtained lease rights from the enemy and puppets during the occupation period applying to the current landlord for continued lease, and residents occupying houses without any lease relationship.</p>
<p>Three Measures: The meeting decided on three unified measures: (1) If a pre-war tenant has no suitable residence and can provide evidence that their relocation was indeed due to the coercion of the enemy and puppets, they may sign a lease with the landlord to continue living there. Tenants who originally signed with the enemy and puppets and lived there should be required to move out within a limited time. (2) If no one makes the above claim, the landlord should sign a new lease with the current tenant according to the rent standard. (3) Those who occupy houses without any procedures should be ordered to move out according to law. It is also heard that these three regulations will be officially sent to the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for coordination and to take the same steps. It is hoped that the residents and owners of Hua'an Fang should follow this correct path to achieve a reasonable solution and resolve the dispute.</p>

The names of the second batch of four ships and the list of captains were also announced yesterday. The first batch of Liberty ships are ranked by the Hai character, followed by the characters Zhong, Xiao, Ren, Ai, Xin, Yi, He, and Ping. However, there are only six ships. The seventh Hai He ship and the eighth Hai Ping ship are still missing two ships. It is heard that they are being built in the United States. One theory is to use the Zhongshan Zhongtong ships to fill the gaps, but this has not yet been decided. It is heard that the second batch of six ships are Victory ships, and have been named Hai Su, Hai Zhe, Hai Wan, Hai Gan, Hai E, and Hai Xiang, six ships.

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance to Amend the Business Tax Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to request the amendment of Article 5 of the Business Tax Law and Articles 9 and 13 of the Implementing Rules, cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday:</p>
<p>Request for Change in Tax-Exempt Standard: "The Municipal Business Tax in Chongqing has recently been taken over by the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and it is levied from October 21st of last year according to the announcement. However, the tax-exempt standard set in Article 5 of the Business Tax Law, the second item of which is 'based on the amount of operating capital, those with operating capital of less than 2,000 yuan,' the original legislative purpose was to consider the small-capital stores. However, in recent years, the currency value has changed dramatically, almost a ratio of one to a thousand compared to the time of legislation. According to the current and past ratios, stores that used to cost thousands of yuan now require hundreds of thousands of yuan. If the statutory tax-exempt standard is followed, then although there is the name of tax exemption, there is no actual tax exemption. We request that your Ministry refer to the current and past situations and change the regulations accordingly to suit the reality.</p>
<p>Uniform Standard for Definition of Capital: Also, Article 13 of the Implementing Rules of the Business Tax Law states that 'the amount of operating capital is calculated based on the original invested capital or paid-up capital, plus public reserve and undistributed profits,' regardless of whether it participates in business operations. Article 9 of the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax Law states that 'for profit-making enterprises of categories A and B, if there are public reserves, one-third can be included in the capital calculation, but only if they have participated in business operations.' That is, the capital for business tax should include all public reserves, while income tax only allows one-third to be included. Both are direct taxes levied by the state, but the definition of capital has the above-mentioned contradictory regulations, which seems inappropriate. We also request a change to a uniform standard so that merchants can follow it, which is fair and convenient. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits,</p>
<p>Please Also Amend the Manufacturing Industry Tax: The association also cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday to request the amendment of the business tax on the manufacturing industry to be levied based on the amount of capital.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Electricity Supply Abolishes Tiered System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai electricity price was previously approved by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau to use a tiered system. The first tier, those under ten degrees, was 12 yuan per degree. The second tier, those exceeding ten degrees but under twenty degrees, was 80 yuan per degree for the excess. The third tier, those exceeding twenty degrees, was 200 yuan per degree for the excess. Large users or institutional users were also divided into three tiers. Within the prescribed limit, it was 35 yuan per degree. Those exceeding the limit within 25 percent were 100 yuan per degree for the excess. Those exceeding the limit by more than 25 percent were 200 yuan per degree for the excess. Recently, due to rising coal prices, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved an additional coal price surcharge of 12 yuan per degree. It is now learned that after the Shanghai Electric Power Company has been urged to reorganize, the power generation has increased. The previous tiered system is no longer necessary. All electric companies have been instructed to abolish the quota limit for large users. For small users (i.e., those within ten degrees), if their total monthly electricity consumption is more than fifteen degrees, they will be treated as large users. The rate will be uniformly calculated at 47 yuan per degree, without the need for application procedures, in order to lighten the burden on citizens. It is heard that the above measures will be implemented starting on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Ample Gasoline Supply</h3>
<p>The British-Fu, De Shi Gu, and Asian petroleum companies in this city received a new batch of gasoline and kerosene totaling over 10,000 tons last weekend, which was evenly distributed among the three companies to meet the city's needs. It is heard that the supply of liquid fuel will become increasingly abundant in the future. Another equal amount of gasoline and kerosene will arrive this week.</p>

After the household registration census is completed, national identity cards will be issued. This household registration census is being conducted completely anew and will not be based on the puppet Baojia household registration books of the enemy and puppets.

<h3>Shi Xiaowu Flies to the Capital to Report on His Work</h3>
<p>Tong Xingbai, the former chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, chief secretary of the Central Overseas Department, and current director of the Central Party Affairs in the Philippines, led the overseas Chinese youth to organize armed forces during the enemy's occupation of the Philippines to engage in anti-Japanese and anti-traitor work. During the recapture of Manila, the troops under his command cooperated with the US military in combat, achieving great merits. The Central Government heard the news and gave him a special award and approved his leave for several months to return to the country to report on his work.

<h3>Where did the Assets of Japanese in Shanghai go?</h3>
<p>— By H.R. Lieberman, originally published in the New York Times on November 31st</p>
<p>Since Japan's surrender, many Japanese assets in Shanghai, along with German assets, have disappeared. These assets were stolen and sold, converted into gold bars, U.S. dollars, foreign exchange, and other forms. The new asset holders are mostly Chinese, Portuguese, and White Russians using aliases. In addition, many assets have been hidden. What is the total value of the transferred and hidden assets? It is simply impossible to estimate. This is because it is difficult to trace the origins, and many documents have been destroyed or altered. According to official reports, the destroyed documents involve at least one bank, which was the trustee bank for the Japanese Navy and Army.</p>
<p>Secret Reports Take Effect The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau was established at the end of October. The bureau has encouraged everyone to secretly report documents, real estate, and movable property such as vehicles, ships, machinery, food, gold, silver, securities, and furniture related to enemy and puppet assets. The bureau also offers substantial rewards for the discovery of enemy and puppet assets as a result of reports: 20% for a total value of Chinese legal tender one million yuan, 15% for a total value under ten million yuan, 10% for a total value under one hundred million yuan, and 5% for a total value exceeding one hundred million yuan. According to Secretary Lu of the bureau, this approach has been very effective. In the second half of October, the bureau received 500 secret reports, which led to the discovery of 50,000 bales of cotton, 45,000 boxes of soap, 4,000 tons of metal, 500 pieces of machinery, 1,200 boxes of porcelain, as well as five factories, large quantities of newspapers, cloth, rice, wheat, flour, alcohol, etc., not to mention other small items. One day, a German came to the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and voluntarily reported that a factory of his had been illegally occupied by Chinese. The handling bureau then sent people to investigate and indeed found something.</p>
<p>People Were Cautious From the time of Japan's surrender until Chinese officials came to Shanghai to effectively enforce their duties, there was a period of one month. During this month, many enemy and puppet assets had already been destroyed. Japanese merchants transported their assets, such as cotton, silk, and machinery, along with goods originally en route to Shanghai, to neutral countries for safekeeping. Goods not transported from warehouses and real estate were transferred to Chinese, Portuguese, and White Russians. Among them were even Japanese friendly cafe waitresses. The contents of factories and residences were moved and sold. When the Japanese sold their assets, they said it was not Japanese property. One printing factory was sold at a good price to one customer, but it was recorded as being sold separately to several customers, indicating that the Japanese were also cautious.</p>
<p>Gold Bars Used for Transactions All these transactions were calculated in gold bars (ten taels each), which were worth about 600 U.S. dollars at the time. The Japanese took these gold bars and buried some of them with people they considered very reliable, and some were transported out of China. According to bankers' estimates, by the end of the war, the gold that the Japanese had transported to Shanghai from Manchuria and Korea (for war needs), along with the existing gold, had reached five to eight times the pre-war amount.</p>
<p>Some of the proceeds from the transactions were in U.S. dollars, but they were not as valuable as gold bars. The Japanese also bought platinum, but they did not buy diamonds because they were not popular. The Japanese also obtained a considerable amount of Swiss francs and Swedish kronor, using Chinese names to avoid attention.</p>
<p>The Property Must Be Returned In principle, the resale of real estate can be traced, because the pre-war owners can return and use documents to prove that it is their property. However, the Japanese established several fake real estate companies to transfer real estate several times, making it impossible to trace and find the real responsible person. Some of the transfer documents were torn up or altered. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau declared that the property must be returned to its original owner, regardless of what happened in between. The Japanese also bribed Chinese officials in an attempt to preserve their property. These disreputable officials have been reprimanded by Chairman Chiang and replaced with more honest people.</p>

<h3>Literature and Bread</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>I don't remember what year it was, but it was always six or seven years ago that I saw an article titled "Literature and Bread" published in an American magazine. At first glance, I thought it was about the lives of men of letters. The experiences of men of letters, whether Chinese or foreign, are always mostly full of ups and downs. In order to eat, men of letters have to bury themselves in writing, doing their best to create day and night. The result of hard thinking is only to exchange for a very small amount of living resources. The Chinese call it "writing books for the sake of rice rations," for the sake of a few斗 of rice. Impoverished Western writers also write to earn bread, also for the sake of eating. Intuitively, I thought the article was saying these things.</p>
<p>After reading it carefully, it wasn't like that at all. The article used witty and lively language to describe how the creation of literary works is exactly the same as the process and method of baking bread. The author based on the procedure and methods of manufacturing bread in a famous New York bread factory, comparing it to the writing skills of literary works. The conclusion is that the creation of literary works, although an art, is also a technique. After reading the article "Literature and Bread", I felt particularly fresh and interesting. Even now, I still think it is a very meaningful article. Unfortunately, the magazine that published the article has long been lost and cannot be found again, so I can only let it leave some vague impressions in my vague memory.</p>
<p>I think a literary work itself is a loaf of bread. For any kind of literary work, its materials are always limited, such as a novel or a play, even if there are many characters and the story is very tortuous, but the central idea that constitutes that novel or play is only one. That is to say, every novel or play has its "theme". A literary work that does not come out of the thread of the theme and does not see the "climax" is definitely not a successful work.</p>
<p>Therefore, the material for literary works is generally very simple, often a fragment of daily life, an accidentally discovered fact, some unnoticed small things, in the hands of the author, they can be rendered into a novel, or even a long novel of hundreds of pages, this is really like a little flour for making bread, which can become a big loaf of bread through "fermentation". Some of the materials that make up a literary work are just like a little flour, and also need to be skillfully handled by the author to make it undergo a literary "fermentation" to become a perfect work. The techniques of setting off, rendering, and refining in literary writing are similar to the various methods required when baking bread. When making bread, the appropriate technique is needed to apply that piece of dough to make it "ferment", the size of the heat is also very important, too much heat will scorch it, and not enough heat will not work, this all depends on the bread maker's ability to use his technique. How the literary author deals with his established subject matter, how to insert a small plot, how to develop the theme, how to show the climax, how to arouse the reader's "empathy", all need the author to use his technique. To achieve "pure fire", mature skill, and the manufacture of excellent bread seem to have similar meanings. Although, generally speaking, no matter how difficult a loaf of bread is to make, it is always much easier than writing a mature literary work.</p>

<h3>New Panacea</h3>
<p>— Zuoyou</p>
<p>In the near future, a brand new medicine will appear in the world. It can cure diseases that penicillin cannot cure, it is a good medicine for all kinds of difficult diseases, it is the nemesis of typhoid fever, bubonic plague, surgical sores, etc., it may even be able to cure pulmonary tuberculosis, and its name is Streptmycin.</p>
<p>The person who invented this thing is an American microbiologist named Waksman. He knew that there were some microorganisms on the surface of the soil that could kill the germs of diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery and bubonic plague, so he mixed soil with water and then sprinkled the muddy water on a glass slide with cultured germs. He studied whether the germs on the glass slide were killed, and then tried to find the murderer who killed these germs. But these murderers were very powerful, not only could they kill animals, but also harm human life, and some could even kill people in a matter of seconds. Of course, Waksman could not use it to make medicine, so he had no success at first.</p>
<p>But in 1943, Cheng and his assistants found a microorganism called Actinomyces griseus. It can kill many germs, and Waksman refined the liquid containing this microorganism and called it Streptomyln.</p>
<p>But Waksman had no experience in making medicine and lacked the equipment for making medicine, so he asked a pharmaceutical factory to assist him in his work. He first wanted to know whether this thing was harmful when used on animals. The test results were quite satisfactory. After a large amount of Streptomycin was used on mice, there were no adverse reactions. Therefore, the pharmaceutical factory immediately mobilized fifty experts to study this novel medicine.</p>
<p>They first used it to test enteritis bacteria. In the laboratory, when enteritis bacteria encountered this medicine, they collapsed without resistance. So they took it to the hospital for testing. After the patient used this medicine, the disease was cured within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>They then used it to treat typhoid fever. A patient suffering from typhoid fever for three weeks recovered very quickly after taking this medicine. Other patients who took it had the same results.</p>
<p>When this news spread, many doctors paid close attention to it. They applied this medicine to various patients, such as dysentery, bubonic plague, sores, etc., and all achieved miraculous effects.</p>
<p>But can this medicine cure pulmonary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>Several researchers applied it to animals with pulmonary disease and actually cured them. Although this medicine can cure animals with pulmonary disease, it is currently impossible to determine whether it can cure pulmonary tuberculosis patients.</p>
<p>However, we know that this medicine and penicillin are like peonies and green leaves, complementing each other. It can cure all the diseases that penicillin cannot cure. Because penicillin is an acidic medicine, and it is a basic medicine. These two medicines can be combined to make a panacea that is enough to deal with almost all diseases.</p>
<p>Publishing</p>
<h3>Commending Loyalty and Righteousness</h3>
<p>— Junyi</p>
<p>In recent months, many publications such as "Ugly Histories" and "Secret Histories" about exposing the private lives of major and minor traitors have been found on newsstands, which are various and innumerable. It is naturally worthy of praise to report the past sins of these traitors, so that they can provide reference materials for the judicial organs during the trial, but some editors, in order to cater to the psychology of ordinary low-level readers, do not hesitate to focus on the erotic stories of "playing with women", and the words are described in detail, which is close to "inducing prostitution" and loses its original intention.</p>
<p>The sins of the traitors have been exposed, but why not commend the heroic deeds of those loyal people who sacrificed their lives for the country during the eight years of the War of Resistance? The area of the occupied area is so wide that it is not known how many martyrs were ravaged and killed by the enemy and puppet regimes. Among them, the stories of shocking the earth and weeping ghosts and gods, which can be sung and wept, are in the minority? If it can be collected and compiled into publications, why can't it attract readers? Although the work is more difficult, its value is far above these "ugly histories" and "secret histories". This will not only make the loyal deeds of thousands of martyrs who have been wronged under the ground immortal, but also allow the people of the world to learn from this and be vigilant in the future. At the same time, the government can use this historical material to settle this blood debt with the enemy. In this way, the task of compiling publications on the loyal and righteous deeds of martyrs cannot be ignored. It is hoped that the publishing industry will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Lessons from the Traitor Chen</h3>
<p>— Tan Ziyou</p>
<p>It is reported that Chen Gongbo, the traitor, once asked for a mirror in his prison cell, and the guard replied: Why bother looking in the mirror?</p>
<p>Indeed, sitting in prison, the traitor Chen will not have anyone to "see" him, nor will the "friendly" Japan notify him to hold a "Greater East Asia Conference". What's the point of looking in the mirror? However, he did ask to borrow one. Because I had nothing to do in my spare time, I thought about it for a long time, and finally came up with a fairly reliable reason - but it's just what I came up with.</p>
<p>The traitor Chen is empty in the prison cell, and there is nothing to do. Writing memoirs and poems is certainly not in the mood, and looking at newspapers is also of little interest. Although a group of Chinese spies has not yet been tried in large numbers, what Laval, Pétain, Göring, Tojo... are bothering him. One night, probably the day before borrowing the mirror, he was lying on the bed, tossing and turning, and suddenly couldn't sleep. Originally, "the night in prison is especially long", he suddenly thought of his own affairs. He thought: Since I was escorted here from Japan, it has been several months. I haven't seen the sun during the day, and there are no electric lights at night. But what will happen to my fate? How is the official investigation of my crimes going? Will I be beheaded in the end? I don't dare to ask the jailer, and I can't figure it out even if I think hard. Suddenly, I thought of China's domestic product - physiognomy. Although I haven't learned it, I can probably see something about "complexion", although it may not be reliable, it can be used to relieve myself, so there is the act of borrowing a mirror.</p>
<p>If I guessed correctly, I would like to tell the guard that next time if the traitor Chen wants to borrow a mirror again, please lend it to him and let him see it clearly. And you should carefully watch his expression from the side. If it's not right - this is often an ominous sign - or even hear self-talk such as "Damn it, it's getting closer", "It's over, it's still an unlucky color", please also pass it on to the reporters, so that they can send a telegram to comfort the people: The big traitor is about to be tried.</p>
<p>Detective Work</p>
<h3>Tire Tracks</h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "fingerprints" are different for everyone and can be used to investigate cases and identify thieves, providing many conveniences for detectives. Now it has been discovered that "tire tracks" are also very valuable in detective work.</p>
<p>Every car has at least four rubber tires. After the vehicle speeds past, the tread pattern of the rubber tire is left on the road surface. Based on this tire track, investigators can determine what type of car passed by that place. If the tread pattern of each car's tire is different, it is not difficult to immediately determine the car's number and owner.</p>
<p>It seems impossible for each car to have a different tire. But American detective scholars have clearly indicated this possibility. There are now 333 different tread patterns applied to tires in the United States. If arbitrarily used on four wheels, there could be 503,107,995 cars with different tire tracks. This huge number is enough for all the cars in the United States to use.</p>
<p>Scientific forecasters say that in the near future, "tire trackology" will definitely be as developed and utilized in detective work as "fingerprintology". "Tire trackology" is still a very unfamiliar new term, but it will undoubtedly open a new era for criminology and be praised by everyone.</p>

<h3>Eradicating "Tigers Among Men"</h3>
<p>— Baoshixi</p>
<p>Tigers eat people, and everyone is afraid of tigers, so "one turns pale at the mere mention of a tiger."</p>
<p>There is no need to be afraid of tigers in the mountains, because we can "easily avoid a spear in the open." "Tigers among men" must be feared, because their "arrows are difficult to defend against in the dark."</p>
<p>Looking back at the past, tigers in the mountains harm fewer people, and "tigers among men" harm more people. Before the war, the "Nazi tiger" in the Western Hemisphere once caused chaos and ate countless people. The "Japanese dwarf tiger" also caused landslides and ground fissures in the Eastern Hemisphere and ate many people.</p>
<p>There are also "Korean tigers", "Kwantung tigers", "Manila tigers", "Singapore tigers", "Wuxi tigers", "Nanjing tigers", "North Station tigers"... as well as "city tigers", "hoarding tigers", "paper tigers"... and so on. Fortunately, we have been able to repel the unbridled power of this group of human beasts, who act as if they are tigers, in today's day when the sun shines again, and have ended their "beastly" lives, while saving the "thin" lives of countless living beings, so that they will no longer be ravaged, insulted and massacred by them. [But we must still be careful to prevent them from resurrecting!]</p>
<p>For the present plan, we should rise up and attack! "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's cubs?" Let us all "go deep into the tiger's den" and, with the spirit of "Wu Song beating the tiger," jointly expose this group of "tigers among men."</p>

<h3>Education Loan Fund Urgently Needs Funds</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Please all sectors of society contribute money and effort, so that impoverished students can continue their studies without interruption.</p>
<p>The reader scholarship advocated by this newspaper, starting from this session, has decided to merge with the *Xinwenbao* (新聞報) loan scholarship into the "Shanghai Education Loan Fund Committee" organized by the Municipal Education Association. From now on, the three parties will cooperate in handling it. This resolution has been announced by this newspaper on the 11th of this month. It is hoped that all readers, enthusiastic donors, authorities of various schools, and students aided by the two newspapers are well aware of this. This newspaper is currently drafting a report on the management of scholarships over the past five years, to be publicly reported to readers. On one hand, we intend to investigate the individuals who have donated the most to aid education over the years and request the government to commend them as an encouragement. On the other hand, the list of students who received assistance in the previous session, except for those whose family circumstances have recently improved and do not require public assistance, and those whose academic performance this semester is poor, will be recommended to the Education Loan Fund Committee for continued assistance to prevent them from dropping out of school. We will handle these two matters separately within the shortest possible time and bring them to a conclusion.</p>
<p>Now, what we hope for from all sectors of society is: Please consider the ten thousand (Note: This newspaper has 2,500 assisted students, *Xinwenbao* has 4,500, and we plan to recruit 3,000 new students, totaling the above number) anxious youths who are afraid of dropping out of school one day, and continuously contribute money and effort, and enthusiastically donate. Those who have enthusiastically donated in the past, please continue to donate; those who have enthusiastically solicited donations in the past, please continue to solicit donations. This constructive and proactive righteous act requires the joint efforts of the entire society to be successful. Anyway, those who previously had to donate to both newspapers simultaneously, now only have one target, the only scholarship fund in all of Shanghai, isn't it easier to handle? According to the Education Loan Fund Committee's estimate, if each of the ten thousand students is assisted with an average of ten thousand yuan, then one hundred million yuan is needed. Currently, only twenty million yuan has been donated, which is still far from the target!</p>

<h3>Published Letters</h3>
<p>Regarding: According to my client, Mr. Tao Heng, he read a letter of appeal signed by Shen Xizhen in the social service column of *Shenbao* (申報) on the 15th of this month, which is far from the truth and extremely shocking. Upon investigation, Shen Liqing, also known as Shen Yanqing, learned in October of the 32nd year of the Republic that Hengsheng Company was assigned 200,000 yuan in counterfeit currency shares by the China Raw Leather Co., Ltd., and requested to attach 100,000 yuan of shares under the alias of Xiji. From the attachment of shares to the distribution of dividends, until the company ceased operations, Mr. Shen personally handled the handover, and there was no such person as Shen Xizhen. Now that the company is closed, I am only a common shareholder and can only wait for a legal resolution. If Mr. Shen believes that he should deal with the matter in any way, he should also discuss it with his fellow villagers and proceed together. There is no reason to aimlessly target me, and even less reason to evade and collude with an unknown third party to make any demands. Since this Shen Xizhen claims to be a woman and has never met me or is familiar with me, how could she dispose of property to attach shares? Isn't this a joke? In addition to entrusting a direct letter to Shen Liqing, also known as Shen Liqing, for negotiation, I am deeply afraid that the rumors are untrue. Please immediately represent the letter and ask *Shenbao* to correct the matter. I sincerely hope that you will publish it in the letters column to clarify the facts. Respectfully, Mr. Editor of *Shenbao*, Lawyer Deng Jiabing.</p>
<h3>He Yingjie Donates 500,000 Yuan Alone, Setting a New Record for Individual Donations in the Fundraising Team</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of loan scholarship fundraising teams by various primary and secondary schools in this city, the results have been excellent. The teachers and students of the private Zhengzhi Primary School have shown great enthusiasm. Under the leadership of Principal Yang Wenyun, they have donated more than 670,000 yuan in legal currency, which was disclosed in the *Minguo Ribao* (民國日報) on the 15th. Among these donations, Mr. He Yingjie personally donated a staggering 500,000 yuan, making him the largest individual donor in the school team, for which we are deeply grateful!</p>
