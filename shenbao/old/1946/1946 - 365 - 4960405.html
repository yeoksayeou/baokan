<p>〔合衆社紐約卅日電〕美國對華政策協會，頃對國務院發言人惠特所稱：蘇聯在大連應有軍事控制權一節，提出異議·該協會要求美政府應迫使蘇聯遵守中蘇協定之規定，即在直接衝突停止時，中國得行使全權，以處理有關民間之事項。</p>

<h3>胡適返抵北平　東單事件已較前緩和　學生遊行亦平安渡過</h3>

<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕胡適今日下午二時一刻自京飛返北平，胡氏對記者否認渠將任行政院長或敎育部長之說。離京前亦未參加內蒙問題之商談。渠謂：「凡關於我的一切謠言，皆不確實，我現在正事力於「水經註」之研究，寫「水經註」跋文已達三本」。某記者詢以此次國大是否爲中國政治走上民主政治之表現。。胡稱：此次國大爲一大的訓練班或大學堂，以中國地域之廣，各地代表聚集於一堂，連說話都不容易懂，這次可以說是一個初步的好訓練。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕胡適卅日上午十一時自京乘中央機返平，傅斯年。楊亮功等均到塲送行，胡行前語記者，因校務諸待處理，返平後暫不南來。北平美兵案尙未悉詳情，自當依法處理。記者詢以皖人請更易省主席事胡答本人希望能換文治派前去主持。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平卅日電〕平市各大學學生，今罷課一日，並於午後遊行，以抗議美軍强姦女生暴行。北大·淸華·燕京·輔仁·師院·中法·交院·朝陽等八校一部份學生二千餘人，午一時於北大集合，一時半出發遊行，經皇城根，東華門，王府井，帥府園，東單，西安門，折轉南池子，北池子，返抵北大解散。遊行行列，在軍調部門口逗留較久，沿途秩序甚佳，午後四時各校學生代表卅餘人，至行轅請願，由燕京代表馬健行，淸華代表李忠立入內陳訴意見，行轅李主任適因公外出，張科長代見，允將醫面呈文轉達，各代表即行退出返校。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕今日平大學生遊行平安渡過。事前美陸戰隊曾約東美軍一律不准外出，東單美軍兵營門口，並繫粗鐵鍊數道，用以阻美軍外出，並防學生衝入，警察當局在東交民巷戒備允嚴，美國府（即今美領事館）皆易中國警察警衛，東交民巷區通往各處要衝，皆有警察多人把守，並備有水龍頭，以防萬一。軍調部鐵門緊閉，門縫亦爲學生之標語所封。中國大學學生二百餘，雖亦曾　加遊行行列，但主張則不同，惟以衆寡懸殊，尙未釀成新事件，亦大幸矣。今日少數警察，隨大隊維持秩序，態度良好，聞警局副局長祝維平曾稱：如果淸華，燕京同學回去走累了，我可以派二十輛大卡車去送他們。</p>
<p>〔本報天津三十日電〕津南開北洋兩大學，已自三十日起罷課，以抗議美兵之侮辱平女生事，兩校二十九日夜，曾分開全體同學大會，並聯合發出吿全國伺胞書，學生情緒極爲激昂。南大決定組織抗議美軍暴行委會，北洋則決定向杜魯門抗議，並即舉行示威遊行，此一波浪正澎湃激盪中。</p>

<h3>聯總各種工礦器材　明春可大量運華　華鳳翔交涉結果極圓滿</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕戰後我國工礦事業亟待復興，政府當局對工礦事業之發展與復原亦甚關注，聯總對中國之工礦器材救濟已規定爲一七四，五〇〇，〇〇〇美元，行總兩月前曾特派工礦器材業務委會主委華鳳翔赴美，與總署交涉工礦物資運華事宜，華氏已於前晚返滬。據吿記者稱：此次交涉，極爲滿意，價値一億七千萬美元之工礦器材，將於明春大量運華，目前行總已收到者的佔總數百分之二十左右，此項工礦器材中以交通器材爲最大宗，的佔百分之八十（一億四千萬美元），其他佔百分之二十，包括鐵路。公路。船隻。電訊事業之器材，以及煤礦·自來水。電力。建築。機械廠之設備。此外，並有撥交敎部分發學校之試騐儀器等，均爲中國工礦復原最急需之物資。華氏繼稱：救濟物資中以工礦器材之分配爲最難解決之問題，其陳因甚多，而最顯著者，有以下數因：（一）大戰以後，世界各國均需要工礦器材，以助復興，美國雖屬工業國，亦難於應；（二）煤礦工廠罷工潮接踴而來，工礦器材之生產大减；（三）聯總工作將結束，而各工廠須於明年夏一律交貨，時間急促；（四）中國之需要亦至大，有佾多粥少之感，唯華氏以爲此次赴美交涉，其結果已屬滿意，中國已向聯總提出所需工礦器材淸單，百分之九十已向工廠定貨，團春各種器材將源源而來。此外並已拒絕接受剩餘物資，因剩餘物資中有甚冬爲中國所不需要之器材，於中國工礦事業無補。最後談及美國屋荒情形，華氏以爲美國之屋荒比中國爲更嚴云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社舊金山三十日電〕舊金山報紙今日刊載美國調查日本賠款專員鮑萊來函，說明日本投降後，蘇方搬取東北工業設備，致東北工業，陷於停頓，更使中國工業發展倒退數代。報紙社評，近曾分析鮑萊所提搬取日本工業設備之建議，以及柬方經濟局勢，故飽萊致函報紙編輯，加以說明稱：「高見認爲東北工業必須恢復舊觀，否則賠款計劃，僅將造成危險的工業眞空狀態，立論完全正確。所不幸者，蘇軍佔領東北期間，搬取東北設備，已使此目標之達成，遭受重大阻礙。美國對戰後遠東之政策，在謀中國强盛，穩定與團結，並在經濟上自給自足，庶中國能在和平亞洲之經濟發展中，佔其正當之一部份。珍珠港事件前後數年間，日人曾在東北建立龐大工業機構，此於日本經濟，確有貢獻。若此機構保持完整，如蘇軍進佔之日然，再若中國保持和平，則東北工業，已可迅速輔助中國在滋長中之經濟，更加速中國整個工業發展矣。東北基本工業之巨大能力，使中國能迅速吸收日本充作賠款之工業加工設備，同時，此舉又可削除日本戰爭潛在力最重要來源之一，日本戰敗，生產能力减至承平時期水準，因而造成經濟上之眞空狀態，中國至少當能塡補其一部份。惟日本投降後，東北工業所受損害，已使中國工業發展倒退數代，而會行美國所宣佈之政策，亦因此大爲阻緩。俄日雙方在東北利益衝突，結果引起一九〇四年之俄日戰爭，日本遂取得南滿之俄方權利。一九〇六年，滿鐵成立，日方榨取東北，已趨具體，復從鐵道擴張至許多工業，作爲繼續深入大陸之動力。一九三一年，日本關東軍侵佔東北，成立僞滿，更加速進行其榨取工作，東北乃相當富庶之地，亞洲其他部份稀有之多種天然資源，東北蘊藏甚豐，農產過剩之廣大區域，爲數無幾，東北其一。</p>

<p>被吿谷壽夫，男，年六十五歲，日本人，住東京，軍官。</p>
<p>右開被吿民國三十五年度偵字第三五號戰犯案件，業經偵查終結，認爲應行起訴，茲將犯罪事實及證據並所犯法條叙述如左：</p>
<p>（一）事實</p>
<p>谷壽夫，日本東京都中野區富士見町人，曾先後在日本陸軍士官學校及陸軍大學畢業，爲日本侵略遝動中之一激進軍人，一生充任軍職，歷任陸軍士官學校學員隊附及大尉，參謀本部部員，及陸軍大學敎官，民國十七年任第三師團參謀長，調至我國山東濟南等地，阻得我國之統一運動，旋調參謀本部演習課長，陸軍省軍事調查委員長。至民國二十六年八月，率軍來華，在香月指揮下，至永定河作戰，繼向保定石家莊前進，在途縱使部屬任意搶劫居民陳嗣哲家中衣服古玩二十八箱，及紅木傢具等物，並强迫我國婦女作肉體之慰安。旋會合預備部隊牛島未松兩師團，合爲一軍，名柳川兵團，於十一月初旬，實行抗州灣登陸後，由抗州而崑山，太湖，直撲南京，攻陷中華門，於是年十二月十三日晨進城，分駐中華門外一帶，該犯於十七十八兩日，參加進城式及慰靈祭，以宣楊其威武，並爲摧殘我國抵抗精神與民族意識起見，與中島今朝吾部，發動舉世震駭，曠古慘劫之南京大屠殺，被害達數十萬人之衆，其所屬部隊，於留駐之十二月十三日至二十一日，週餘期間之罪行，第一爲屠殺，計在中華門外鷄鵝所，南村，沙洲圩，賽紅橋，集合村，涉公橋，雙橋，雨花台等處，及城內門東中營，轉龍巷，倉門口，錦繡坊，仁厚里，瞻園路，蓮子營一帶，槍殺與刺殺及以其他殘酷方法殺害李錦有，王珍全，陳錦福，張書城，周洪氏，韓馬氏等九百餘人。就其殺人之原因言，吳學詩等拉伕不從被殺，李又名等完成伕役亦被殺，殷德才等見放火施救旣被殺，張貢才等見燃燒民房哀懇亦被殺。又李孫氏之被殺，以其避難於防空壕中，韓馬氏等數十人之被殺，因强索柴米之吿罄，又向趙陸氏等索姑娘不獲殺之，强姦周張氏等不遂殺之，強姦或輪姦楊劉氏等後又殺之，又張世準等維護子女而被殺，王二毛見父母被害號泣而被殺；就其殺人之手段言，鄧家　則總而殺之，盛懷連則迫今跪地而殺之，馮天祥等則集體而殺之，莫啓東等則先刑而後殺之，程永慶則刺傷而後勒死之，童章餘等則槍斃之餘又焚其屍，是無事不可殺，無人不可殺，無地不可殺，無術不可殺，誠近代文明史上之恥辱。其次為強姦，計在城內外沙洲圩，賽虹橋，九兒巷，安德門一帶，強姦陳二姑娘及輪姦楊劉氏等四十餘人，又次為肆意破壞財產，計在上列地帶被害者有盛實甫，張老存等十數戶，種種罪行，罄竹難書，及戰事結束後，該犯在日本東京被捕，由中國駐日代表團囑解來華，經國防部戰犯管理局移送偵查到庭</p>
<p>（二）理由</p>
<p>查該被吿以其畢生精力，推行日本征服東亞必先征服中國之侵略國策，歷任參謀本部部員，演習課長，陸軍省軍事調查委員長，參預侵略之陰謀，及支持對我國之侵略行動，歷任士官學校隊附，敎官，及參謀長，旅團長，師團長，訓練以侵略爲且的之軍事人才與部隊，又進兵我國，阻礙我國之統一運動，侵害我國之主權，及參加對我之侵略戰爭。此項事實，有日本內閣迭次之各種策動，如近衛聲明，廣田三原則，東亞新秩序等文告與行動，可以覆按，並有關東軍司令官本莊繁致日本陸相書，以及華北駐屯軍參謀長酒井隆受命發動華北侵略行動之戰犯酒井隆卷證可稽，即該被吿對於迭任各職，亦供認不移，復有其自撰之履歷存卷足證，均相吻合。决查該被吿行軍所至，在河北保定，搶刦陳嗣哲之衣服古玩二十八箱，及紅木傢具，在南京中華門附近，勒索韓馬氏等柴米，吿罄之餘，加以殺害，此類罪行，有被害人即現任司法官陳嗣哲等及目覩之證人黃昌慶等數十人，分別具結證明，並由首都地方法院檢察處及南京臨時參議會，先後派員調查屬實。又查該被吿縱屬在南京中華門內外之沙洲圩，強姦周丁氏及陳二姑娘等三人，於賽虹橋强姦劉實琴等四人，於九兒巷黃泥塘各處，强姦或輪姦伍大毛等十餘人，又於行軍途中及在南京雨花台等處，向陳王氏等强索姑娘作肉體之慰勞。以上事實，亦各有被害人或目覩之證人陳士興，劉李氏，陳二姑娘，伍李氏，朱修谷，賈學書等分別具結或到庭證明歷歷，復經地檢處及臨參會派員查明無訛。又查該被吿縱屬在南京中華門內外鷄鵝所槍斃李錦有等三人，於南村槍斃王竹全等二人，於沙洲圩槍斃陳錦福等四人，於門東各地槍斃周小二子等數百人，又於新路口刺殺夏叔蘭等八人，於雨花台各地刺殺趙殿高等數十人，又於正覺寺，雨花路，石觀音，四方城各地，集體屠殺廣善等八十餘人，在土城頭高替柏村各地，先刑後殺張李氏老侯莫啓東等人，又於西街等地，將　章餘等殺斃之餘，又焚其屍，此類犯罪事實，除有證人黃修印，陸隆，王萬氏，呂張氏，王田氏，王當有等數十人分別具結或到庭證明屬實外，復有調查卷可稽。又查該被吿縱屬在長樂路，中華門，膺府街等處，肆意破壞陳沈氏，王子亭，陳長餘，馮兆美，劉漢飲等戶之財產，旣有被害人或目覩之證人丁萬和，陳沈氏，陳長餘，葉姚氏等分別具結或到庭證明在卷，又有調查人簽註，可資佐證。（下文轉入第三版）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>我國與敎廷關係的展望</h3>
<p>敎廷公使李百里於一昨向我　主席呈遞就任國書，這的確展開了中國與敎廷關係的新頁。敎廷與中國之關係肇端於元代，顧自後歐亞之陸路交通被阻，我國與敎廷之關係遂絕。明季歐人航海東來，於是天主敎士復來我國。其時値歐洲所謂宗敎改革時代之後，聖依肋爵羅育樂目睹時艱，有耶穌會之創立，以學術傳敎致力於所謂反宗敎改革，風氣所播，使天主敎會之聲譽爲之一振。明季到我們中國來的就是這班比較早期的耶穌會士，秉學術傳敎之會訓，此輩東來敎士，多儒服衣冠，與當時之士大夫相交往，一時碩彥若徐光啓李之藻等又復受洗奉敎，故天主敎在當時曾稱盛一時。明室垂傾，宗室中人且有致書當時之敎宗者，可見當時天主敎流行之盛。淸初仍沿明制，所以天主敎亦能流傳，其後雍正頒禁敎之令，而敎會又有禁止祀孔祭祖之令，致天主敎之流傳，大受打擊。一直到了一八四〇年後，列強與我開始簽訂不平等條約時，天主敎在中國的流傳纔獲得了條約的保障。自淸季以迄民國十二年間，雖中國與敎廷雙方都有建立關係的願望，一直沒有付諸實施。到民國十二年間，敎廷派遣剛恒毅總主敎來華，任首任敎宗駐華代表，並在北平設宗座駐華代表公署，是爲敎廷與中國首次所建立之正常關係；其後剛總主敎回國，敎宗任命蔡寗總主敎繼其任，以迄今年八月，敎廷更有首任駐華之任命。敎廷與我國直接關係之建立，己於二十年前見於剛總主敎以首任駐華宗塵代表名義之東米，本不從此次李百里公使始；不盡李百里公使係以外交代表之資格來，他的蒞任，表示中國與敎廷閒正常外交關係的建立。這是爲此，所以李百里公使的就任，展開了中國與敎廷關係的新頁。</p>
<p>中國派造公使駐在敎廷是我國戰時外交的一大成就，其時大戰方酣，交通梗阻，所以敎廷沒有派遣使節來華，等到這次戰事結束，遂有派遣外交使節來華之議。如今李公使業經就任，中國與敎廷間的外交關係於焉確立，實在是一件値得欣慰的事。敎廷爲天主教敎宗之所居，而敎宗所居之地，自羅馬帝國東遷以還，即已特殊化，其轄境不僅有羅馬，且包括有今意大利中部一帶地，自成國家。故敎宗不僅爲全世界天主敎之領袖，且爲敎宗直接統轄國家之首長。這個直轄的國家到意大利薩單王朝的興起而消滅，一直到第一次世界大戰後在意大利與敎廷間所訂立的拉特郞條約，纔又重新確定了敎宗居地的地位。自法律上言之，敎廷所在地梵蒂岡亦爲一獨立國家，它有它自巴的制度；因爲是一個獨立國家，它也可能與列國建立外交關係。然而梵蒂岡轄境不過一百多英畝，僅相當於一個大的私人莊園。不是因爲梵蒂岡，我們纔有外交關係的建立，倒是因爲梵蒂岡裏有敎廷，所以我們纔有外交關係的建立，我們現在所建立的不是我國與梵蒂岡的外交關係，而是我國與敎延的外交關係。我們派往的是駐敎廷（The　Holy　See），而不是駐梵蒂岡（Vatican）的公使，敎廷所派來的也不是梵蒂岡公使，而是敎廷公使（Apostolic　Internuncio）。這是我們所必須認淸的一點：因此，我們可以說中美關係，中英關係，但中國與敎廷的關係，卻萬不能簡稱爲中梵關係。</p>
<p>如今我們旣與敎廷建立外交關係，我們要問是項外交關係建立的目的究竟是什麼？也許我們在外交關係上不能問目的，但一般外交關係的建立，無疑地是在謀兩國間友好親睦商務文化各方面關係的增進。國與國交，於一般的友好條約以外，別有商務航行條約的簽訂，以爲兩國關係的一般準則。我國與敎廷旣有協定互換使節；如今有任敎廷公使亦已來華蒞任，是我國與敎廷間所亟應進行的，便在於有關敎務的條約的簽訂，因爲敎廷的中心工作是傳敎，它的公使還具有帶有傳敎意味的Apoctolic字樣；和一般國家。我們可以有通商航行條約，與敎廷我們就不能不有有關敎　的條約。我們如今旣與敎廷建立外交關係，便應該繼續有關於傳敎及敎務條約的簽訂。有了這條約，天主敎會在中國纔有它法律的地位——因為條約，就等於去律。講到天主敎會的在中國，我們要認淸這一點，就是天主敎會之在中國，有法國的敎士，美國的敎士，意大利的敎士，本國的敎士，乃至匃牙利，波蘭及俄國的敎士，他們雖有國籍的不同，但他們之爲天主敎會服務則一。天主敎會是不可分的：在中國的大主敎會是一個單位，這裏面不容許有分裂。在過去，法國敎士有我們與法國所訂的條約爲護符，美國敎士有他們的條約爲護符。但到了今天，我們再不能以辦理「洋務」的精神來處理敎務。我們對於「敎務」的本身要有了解。天主敎會是整個的，當地的主敎是木國人固然是中國敎會，就是當地的主敎不是中國人，亦是中國敎會；因爲天主敎會的基礎不是主敎而是敎友。正因爲天主敎會在中國情形的複雜，我們更需要與敎廷成立條約來決定天主敎會在中國的地位。如今敎會體制雖在中國建立，但中國的天主教會還沒有達到自給自立的境地。全中國除二十個總主敎區外。還有一百餘個主敎區：我們不能宰割它們；它們同爲一體。</p>
<p>天主敎會是一個龐大的組織絹單在中國，敎友人數在全國人口中所占的百分比雖不高，但已有四百多萬人。在這樣一個龐大的組織，良　不齊是難免的。天主敎三個字不能算爲善良行爲的保證是當然的事，並不足爲怪。但我們的政府自主席以决，對天主敎是愛護的，由於這次我國與教廷外交關係的建立，我們希望我國與敎廷能有敎務條約的簽訂，使天主敎會在中國能循正軌以發展。</p>

<p>自北平美軍發生所謂汚辱女生案件以來，事態日趨嚴車，且有蔓延及於上海之勢。對於這不幸事件的發生，我們滅覺得遺憾；但事態之擴大到這般地步，我們亦不能不認為遺遺。如果這是一件汚辱女生的事件，這裏面我們所必須明瞭的一爲事賞間題，一爲法律問題。究竟是否爲一宗強姦案件，在通常民主法治的國家，必須經過司法的審判。英美法系的Jury制度，便在決定有無犯罪的事實。等到犯罪的事實判明以後，這是法官的責任來依法處刑。如今被認爲犯罪的一方是軍人，亦應經軍法的程序。如果軍法的判決不當，那纔可以出以法律以外的手段。所以在目前事實及處刑問題未判定公布以前，我們所需要的是鎭定。今事態未明瞭以前，而發生有所謂罷課運動，甚至有前美軍退出中國運動，這不僅是小題大做，而且亦正足以反示我們對於民主政治的沒有訓練；於今高唱民主的時候，總不免有點遺憾。請美軍退出中國運動不自今番北平女生被辱的案件始；一般的反美運動亦不自今番始。本報對於是項運動，前曾著論有所論列，以爲此與中國人民的意向相違，當今國民大會圓滿閉幕，國家夫法於焉制定，惟恐中國不亂的人，便一意想發動某種運動，以與中國人民爲難。這次北平不幸事件的發生，郤產生了一個火種。對於此案，如果被認爲罪行果有其事，我們相信美國當局必能有合乎正義的處置；我們本不必有什麼擴大行動。如今之所以有擴大行動者，我們不必追究它的動機；此在一般有資格的觀察者自能明瞭。我們所引爲遺憾的就是身爲師表的敎授們，竟也有不明事理而從事於度外的行動的。我們於此所要申述的就是北平乃有此項不辛事件的發生，這是一個法律問題，我們應聽候法律的制裁。　於此，我們有不能不述帶述及的就是：（一）從國家的立塲，中國的高等敎育，多受國家的支持；各大學的當局應該如何仰體國家作育入材的一番至意，使教育與國家打成一片。此次因女生被辱案件如果引起國立大學的罷課，這是各受國家支持的大學有負於國家。（二）從人民的立塲，人民送他們的子弟對國家支持的大學受敎，是人民對於國家的信任，對於各該大學的信任。身負大學敎育責任的校長應如何仰體國家及人民托之重，努力將事，乃聞竟有權離職守之人，坐是造成學生罷課，是誠言之痛心。我們要於此籲請各大學不因此女生被辱的事件而有擴大的行動；不是說我們不應該關心女生的被辱，而是要表現我們民主法治的精神。我們所需要的是民主國家人民所應有的緣定。</p>

<h3>戰犯谷壽夫起訴書　上接第二版</h3>
<p>綜上以觀，該被吿於戰前及戰時，違反國際條約及公約，陰謀預備發動並支持對我國之侵略，復違反戰爭法規及慣例，直接或間接施暴行等，犯罪行爲，實屬罪證確鑿，無可飾辯，雖該被吿仍一再辯稱：（一）本人在返日之前，並未聞部屬有强姦殺人一類罪行，所謂種種暴行殊難置信，（二）當時到南京部隊繁多，縱有罪行，亦不能證明爲本軍所爲，本人實難負責，（三）本人統屬部隊甚嚴，並一再誥誠，不得對非戰鬥人員，加以暴行，本人部隊曾作戰各地，並無人指控有何罪行，足徵南京之大屠殺，並非本軍所爲，（四）設立慰安所係向當地長官商量，並徵求慰安婦女之同意，始行設立云云。然查南京之大屠殺，爲日本摧殘我國抗戰精神與民族意識之行動，在作戰之中，我國國土淪陷過多，除南京外，亦不無他處如南京之大屠殺，不能因該被吿在他處無類此大屠殺，即證明在南京亦無此類暴行，况該軍在保定搶刦平民財產，有被害人證明在卷，是其部屬並不如所陳之良善，其次，南京之大屠殺，被害人達數十萬之多，而最初一週，亦即大屠殺之最高峯，即該被吿之駐區，就現存證據言，則無時無地，不有種種縣行發生，而該被吿竟諉稱一無所知，一無所聞，顯見情虛畏究，飾詞詭辯。且南京大屠殺，旣爲舉世共知之事實，並有影片，照片，各種記載，檔案，以及數千份表結，數十人到庭結證屬實，殊難因該被吿空言不能置信，免其刑責。又况中華門內外一帶，爲該被吿駐軍之區域，此係該被吿所自認，在其駐軍期內，有屠殺，姦淫，種種暴行，被害人可證明者，已達數千之衆，該被吿所屬，不自行犯罪，決無任其他部隊前來犯罪之理，又其他部隊，各有駐區，各有可殺可姦之對象，又決無捨近圖遠之理，况進攻中華門者，爲該被告之部隊，進城即殺人，萬將　以諉卸。再次，我國婦女及社會風尙，向無以肉體作慰勞之習慣，即本國行軍，亦不能使其同意犧牲色相，况爲敵軍，且就其在南京强索婦女不遂殺人觀之，允足證所謂徵其同意爲虛飾。至於被吿之服役，及來華作戰，固係奉行國策，執行命令，第陰謀侵略及發動侵略戰爭，均係違反國際條約，破壞國際和平之行爲，且該被吿於作戰期間，縱屬肆意屠殺，强姦，搶刦，允屬違反戰爭法規，決難减免其罪責，長該被吿種種罪行，實無諉卸餘地。蓋國聯盟約第十條，九國公約第一條，均揭著應尊重會員及我國領土之完整，與政治之獨立，巴黎非戰公約，則斥責以戰爭爲隨行國家政策之工具，海牙和的，關於敵對行爲，又有明文，詎該被告，始則對於侵略之陰謀與行動，作有力之支持，繼則出兵山東，阻碍我國之統一十運動，侵害我國之主權，終則參加對我不宣而戰之侵略戰爭，顯係違背各該國際公約之規定，自應成立破壞和平罪。又其在我國作戰期間，肆意搶刦及破壞財產，對於平民作有計劃之屠殺與强姦，强迫婦女入慰安所，以及强姦之後，加以殺害，拉伕之餘，予以屠戮，現夫集體屠殺殺後焚屍等暴行，違背海牙陸戰法規第二十三條第一項第三款，第七款，第二十八條，第四十六條第一項，第四十七條，應搆成戰爭罪及違反人道罪，以上違反和平罪，雖連續灰二十餘年之久，戰爭及違反人道罪，雖反覆行之，然旣係基於概括之故意，自應各論以一罪。又違反和平罪，與戰爭及違反人道罪，並非有方法結果關係，自應分別論罪，合併處罰。又該被吿處心積慮，從事侵略，破壞國際和平，侵犯我國主權，在戰爭中又以違反人道及戰爭法規種種暴行，加諾手無寸鐵之平民，並在南京造成曠古未有之浩劫，窮兇極惡，舉世共憤，併應科處極刑，以維正義與和平。</p>
<p>據上論結，爰依中華民國戰爭罪犯審判條例例第二條第一款，第二款，第四款，第三條第一款，第四款，第六款，第十七款，第二十四款，第二十七款，等三十六款，第三十八款，第四條，第八條，第九條，第十條，第十一條，刑法第十一條，第二百二十三，刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一款起訴。此致本庭審判官，中華民國卅五年十二月廿五日，國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭，主任檢察官陳光虞。</p>

<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿九日電〕蘇聯內閣會議今日議決，任命現任該國駐聯合國安理會代表之葛羅米柯爲外交部决長。蘇聯今共有外决五人，即維辛斯基·古賽夫（前駐英大使），馬利克·特卡諾索夫及葛羅米柯。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿九日電〕關於葛羅米柯升任蘇外决，此問各界人士，迄今尙未加以評論，蓋因此項消息，並未指出葛氏之任外决，是否將使蘇聯出席安理會及其他國際組織之代表有所調動。此間一般般印象認爲葛羅米柯仍將繼續在聯合國機構行使代表職務，果爾，則蘇聯之重視聯合國機構，可於此見之。</p>

<h3>歲末速寫　希魔造孽德國苦</h3>
<p>德國經六年的戰爭和一年半的佔領之後，刻正面臨饑餓，疾病與不安，六千萬人民就在這種情形下，迎接新年…</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿九日電〕德國六千萬人民大部份在半餓斃的口糧制度下煎熬。黑市向他們吞食，貧窮驅他們犯罪，肺病，軟骨和其他病症蔓延。德國的土地必須帮助維持數十萬佔領軍和近百萬外國人的給養。據聯合國估計，四百餘萬需要復興祖國的德國人都淪爲戰俘。英美佔領區軍政府官員展望來年的德國，將有下列各種情形：（一）半餓斃的口糧，將使兒童身體遭受不可補償之損失，除非改善營養；（二）一部份俘虜遣送回國；（三）減少一部份佔領軍；（四）難民問題的局部解決。</p>
<p>糧食匱乏仍爲德國最大難題。英美佔領區有四百餘萬人受聯合國的佈施。平時每日口糧爲一千五百卡羅里，衛生當局所定最低營養需要則爲二千卡羅里。此一問題，毫無早日解決之望。美英官員似乎贊成給予德國貿易上刺激性的」貸款，以便該國運出貨物，獲得款項償付一部份糧價。此舉雖可減輕聯合國的負担，但對於德人的營養，不能有多大改善。</p>
<p>英美法佔領區調查結果，肺病流行，德國投降以來花柳病猖獗，一部份歸咎於盟國。戰後各城市中出生的小兒有一大部份都患軟骨病，因缺乏丁種維也命故。黑市和麻醉品及烟酒販賣，極爲盛行。英國佔領下的柯隆，咖啡每磅售價三百馬克（的合美金三十元），汽車胎每枚一千五百馬克，一克拉的鑽石價二萬馬克。大部份人民都是赤貧。譬如杜塞道夫城的普通工人，每星期工資三十馬克，但買不起五馬克一磅的馬鈴薯或十二馬克一磅的黑市蘋果，只有靠麵包過活。領得麵包有時須排隊十二小時之久，該城警察局被吿罪案激增。窮人向鄰居偸竊。敞碎木製招牌當柴燒，農人多淪爲小竊。最近有火車一輛在奧勃霍森站稍停，幾分鐘之間，被竊去煤斤三四噸。</p>
<p>德軍在大戰中死傷七百萬人。四百萬人作俘虜，大部份仍在國外。德人恐懼多數俘虜的撤回本國，將長期延擱。美國擬在最後和會前，將十萬名德俘，大部份遣回。英國則擬於一九四九年以前，將三十餘萬德俘遣回。但法蘇兩國已表示需要德國勞力賠償，以供長期復興工作。法方拘有俘虜六十萬人，蘇方所有俘虜則在三百萬人以上。美方官員刊料今後數月內，德境蘇軍將減少百分之三十至五十。史達林元帥今年十月報吿德境蘇軍爲二十師，其他聯合國軍界估計蘇軍爲四十萬至六十萬人。美國允許於明年七月以前減少駐軍至十五萬人，英國戰將同樣減少駐軍。留德之外國難民，六十萬在美國佔領區，其餘在英國佔領區。此輩之留居，因並不强迫遣回波蘭和蘇聯領土之故，難民中大部份來自該兩國。一部份美國官員希望不久聯合國自軍政府接辦難民遣散事宜。</p>

<p>與處理局有聯繫之敵偽產業審議委員會，仍將繼續存在，惟將以前獨立之逆產處理委員會及開支審核委員會二單位併入。以後審議會決定發還或沒收產權以及產業物資處理辦法，待獲得決議後，即由秘書長行文辦理之。</p>

<p>（又訊）絲織業工人年終獎金問題，迄未獲得解決，有局部工廠工人均已怠工，社局正在積極勸導中。</p>

<h3>三機失事慘案　三檢察官產地查勘　民航機向無雷達設備</h3>

<p>行總方面，昨對此事未予置評，僅謂此事係由聯總負責。而聯總發言人，昨對此事亦不欲有所表示。</p>
<p>航運大隊人員對艾格頓氏之呈文中，曾表示彼等過去三月內所得之報酬，實遠不及原來協約之規定。彼等薪金，現係依照美匯三千五百餘元計算，彼等實已損失一半以上。</p>
<p>彼等謂航運大隊曾對退職人員作種種空頭允諾，而事實上大率未能實行，此次除加抗議外，復要求此後退職時予以充分保障。如航運大隊仍將此項要求不予置理，則自一月二日正午起，彼等決定罷工。按行總航運大隊現有登陸艦艇等共八十艘左右，行總自滬將物資運輸至內地各處，多係由此項船舶負責。</p>

<p>人和助產學校卅週紀念　添建校舍發動籌募基金</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕私立人和高級助產職業學校，係名醫師張湘紋女士所創辦，自民國六年至明年元旦日，適爲該校三十週年紀念。歷年來該校畢業生計近千人，除在上海服務者約二百人外，餘皆分佈全國各地。現在該校求學者有助產士一一七人，護士二八人。但該校因現有莫利愛路三十六號人和醫院附屬校址不敷應用，無從擴展校務，張女士已將私人購買該校前空地一方捐助學校，擬興建一三層樓房作教室之用，建築基金將自元旦起發動募捐，目標爲一億五千萬元，共分三十五隊，計有隊長七十人，隊員二百八十人，每隊擔任募捐四百五十萬元。新校舍建成後，張校長希望先收納二百人，以後視經費情形再加擴充。</p>
<p>助產士學程，規定三年畢業，初中畢業程度均可入學，第二年開始在人和及尚賢婦孺醫院實習，第三年分派至各醫院實習，畢業後參加會考，即成爲正式助產士，歷年畢業生中頗多社會名醫，如賀耀祖夫人倪斐君女士同係該校民十八年畢業生。實習　　，每生至少接生四十次。該項學費極低，一學期共十六萬元，並另設免費額百分之二十八。護士學程爲三年半，第一半年全部免費。該校現有教職員三十餘人，教務長由人和醫院醫務主任劉劍秋女士担任。多數教員係義務執教，如劉教務長月薪僅七萬元。張湘紋女士係上海醫學院畢業生，曾留學美國，於民十二年畢業紐約醫學研究院產婦科。隊創辦助產學校外，並舉辦人和醫院及尚賢婦孺醫院。人和醫院本年度共收病人一八四八人，免費者二四八人，育兒部二三一人，現有病床八十隻。醫師八位。該院於九年前開始收容棄兒，或如貧弱產婦生產後無力撫養，可由該院暫爲護養，至產婦恢復健康後送還。棄兒則另有人收領，但棄兒五十名中，僅二個男孩，餘皆爲女孩，張女士服務社會，不遺餘力，雖校舍經費有限，在授課時間外，並利用課室辦民眾學校，收有小學程度學生三十人。衛生局局長張維以張女士有功社會國家，已呈請市府給予褒獎。</p>

<h3>水銀燈下末次審「狼」　米村大言不慚依然否認殺人　辯論終結定下月六日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前常熟敵憲兵隊隊長米村春喜興獄殺人一案，於上星期六經第一綏靖區軍事法庭陸起法官提審後，昨日下午三時再開合議庭作最後之審結。出席庭長李良，審判官陸起，瞿澤曾，張世傑，李欽后，檢察官屠廣鈞，書記官汪叔良，及被告辯護律師錢隆生。法官席上用作物證之人頭兩顆及枯骨數根，赫然陳列。旁聽席間座無虛位，中央電影攝製塲之水銀燈强光照射，一掃該庭數月來之沉寂。</p>
<p>米村仍衣草綠色軍服大衣，身佩水壺。入庭後即將大衣水壺除下，李庭長先詢渠姓名籍貫後，即問對於起訴書中所列各罪有無話說。米村從容將手套取下，繼自大衣袋中摸出預先寫就之草稿紙一張，滔滔自辯。其辯辭內容爲（一）三十二年間在太倉常熱一帶捕人，並將其中一部份解送十二軍軍法處，確爲事實，但此係奉令執行。（二）起訴書中稱被捕之十七人送至軍法處，其餘五人生死不明。但當時送至軍法處者共爲十九人，其餘三人因病而死。（三）否認有菲刑虐待等事。如部下有此類行爲，渠僅應受行政上之處分。（四）請庭上勿憑信被害人家屬之言，並大言不慚，自謂在常熟四年，鄕人均謂渠好，但現在他們不敢說好，竟無禮直稱：「中國人很會說謊」云云。</p>
<p>李庭長當即質以重要關鍵四點：（一）問：所稱捕人係奉上司命令，有何證據？答：可問上司上野中將。（二）問：捕人係由上司突然下令，抑先由憲兵隊提供情報後，始行下令？答：憲兵隊先提過情報。（三）問：捕人之前，是否曾拆卸楊姓房屋，建造牢房四座？答：是的。（四）問：所稱病死三人之屍體，交於何人？答：交與其家屬，當時有收條，現已失落，可詢問家屬。庭上當斥以被害人家屬從未領到屍體，並令其於記錄上畫押。繼傳昔年曾被米村之部下河野等無端逮捕之蘇州人鞏啓仁作證，歷述曾被灌水及踐踏六次，並受吊跪等酷刑。</p>
<p>庭上旋又出示米村月前該庭派員在常熟北門外發掘被害屍骨之照片，並由　譯官譯述前常熟縣立醫院職員陳雲舟，葉靈真等所供證之筆錄。米村雖面對法官席上之人頭枯骨，但了無懼色，仍矢口否認。</p>
<p>最後檢察官及被告辯護律師相繼起立辯論。屠檢察官認爲被告負戰爭罪犯條例及刑法上濫施職權殺人虐待之罪，應判死刑。辯護律師則辯稱，所有罪行均係米村之下屬所爲，不應由米村負責，諸予宣判無罪。</p>
<p>時已近傍晚六時，李庭長以事實業已明瞭，宣告辯論終結，改期三十六年一月六日下午二時宣判。</p>

<h3>糧貸案中第一被告　王巽之昨經提訊　因公務員懲戒會查詢　訊知即屬曾涉貪污罪嫌之局長</h3>

<h3>厲行禁毒　嚴加制裁　被判處徒刑煙毒犯　未便率予免除其刑　地院裁定書所敘理由</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勝利後政府決意於短期內肅清烟毒，令烟民登記限期戒絕，并大事拘捕繼續吸毒之烟犯，送地院法辦，凡吸毒有據者皆判徒刑，各被告經勒戒後業已斷癮，檢察官曾根據刑法保安處分代爲聲請免其刑之執行者，除袁美雲·夏佩珍二人外，前後計王客權·沈小妹·施毓秀·曹秀英·劉氏·陳子梅·傅小妹·趙金標·王金山·馬子仁·李董氏·李莉·李文興·王陳英·金張氏·謝陸氏·沈馬氏·陳也也·吳三妹等十九名，唯經地院裁定一律駁回，理由大致相同，茲刊錄其中一裁定書全文如下：</p>
<p>「被告吳三妹，女，年四十三歲，廣東人，住湖北路一八三號在押。右開被告因烟毒案件經檢察官聲請免其刑之執行，本裁定如左：</p>
<h3>主文　聲請駁回。</h3>
<p>理由　查核卷宗本件被告於本年八月七日，因吸食雅片，由上海市警察局移送本院，經本院於本年八月十二日判處有期徒刑六月，限期二月勒令禁戒斷癮，判決確定在卷。在執行中檢察官以被告於勒令禁戒後，經法醫騐明斷癮，認爲無執行徒刑之必要，聲請免除期刑之執行前來。茲本院按刑法第八十八條規定，依禁戒處分之執行，法院認爲無執行刑之必要者，固得免其刑之執行，淮當茲政府厲行肅清烟毒之際，正宜嚴加制裁，使無知烟民，有所警惕，殊未便援引上開法案，率予免除其刑。且原判決處刑極輕，刑期轉瞬屆滿，更無免除其刑之必要，應予駁回。合依刑事訴訟法第四百八十五條裁定如主文。」</p>

<h3>戰前存款償還問題　高院二審宣判　　定期存款八百倍　零儲整付五百倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰前債務及銀行存款償還問題，已一再發生訟爭，本市地院之判決皆以一千倍爲標準。當事人向高等法院上訴後，高院因不願造成判例，故對上訴各案咸勸諭試行和解。然原被吿每多堅持主張，和解極難成立。高院乃於昨晨判決兩案：民國二十九年起之五年定期存款改判以八百倍償還。民國二十七年起五年零儲整付存款改判以五百倍償還。茲彙誌詳情如下：</p>
<p>（一）市民陳季琳於民國二十九年五月六日，以法幣二千元存入四行儲蓄會，訂期五年，於去年五月六日到期，陳依復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條，及司法院院字第三〇一八號解釋，請求法院判以三千倍增加給付，經地院判決被吿四行儲蓄會，應以一千倍增加給付。四行儲蓄會不服，向高院上訴，昨晨二審宣判，原判決撤銷，改判依八百倍增加給付。（二）上訴人聚興誠銀行，因原吿陸煜陸焜，於民國廿七年九月廿八日，與同年十二月十四日起，存有特種零儲整付存款，陸煜計結二千三百十一元四角三分，陸焜計結二千一百八十五元零三分，訂期五年，均至民國三十一年五月份到期。本年八月間陸氏兄弟具狀請求以一千倍償還，經地院判決以八百倍計算償還。聚興誠不服上訴，昨晨高院二審宣判：原判決撒銷，改判以五百倍計算償還。</p>
<h3>人民檢舉漢奸　有效期今截止　高極處尙未接獲正式命令</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於漢奸檢舉限期間題，昨據高檢處負責人談稱：該處尙未接獲正式命令，惟國府已於本月十三日發表訓令，其內容略謂：「關於定期撿舉漢奸，業經國防最高委員會二一一次常務會議議決，人民或團體對於抗戰時期漢奸案件之吿發，以卅五年度十二月卅一日以前爲限，逾期吿發，檢察官不予置議，但國家之追訴權及被害人之吿訴權，不因此而受影響。」就此而論，檢奸範圍業已縮小，以杜絕狹嫌誣吿之弊，但檢奸工作幷未因此而結束云。</p>

<h3>第四期第四次配紗　紡管會改定新價　廿支標價一百九十七萬五千元</h3>
<p>（本報訊）紡管會於昨日下午四時，在市府會議室，召開紗價審委員會，到吳兼主委，束云章，王啓字，列席李升伯，吳味經，郭棣活，葉一心，及紡管會業務處長劉文騰等。經多時之討論、終決定第四期第四次配紗新價，即廿支紗新議價為每件一百九十千元。其他各級紗支，均依此比例推算。又第四期第四次複製業配紗，決於一月六議價全部核配。</p>
<p>昨日鑒定之新價格，係第四期第四次配紗之售價，其中已包括統稅及百分之二十之利潤到於中央收購之價格，則尙有待於宋院長之核定。聞昨日會中已擬具草案，供宋院長參考，其內容據列會者談，爲大山小異。</p>
<p>又計算棉紗成本之會計項目，亦經昨會決定，並規定不論國營民營，一律依據下列各項目計算之：（一）原料。（二）工資。（三）製造費：其中包括（甲）物灶（乙）折舊（丙）職工福利（丁）動力費，（戊）職員薪水及津貼（己）修繕費：包括機器之修理及房屋之修理。（庚）其他。（四）財務費（利息）。（五）業務費（即為管理費，如紡建公司管理處之開支等）。</p>
<p>對於棉花之價格問題，昨會中亦曾加討論，惟意見不一。決定之新議價中，其棉花價格以每担廿五萬元計算，每件以三担半計。而統稅之歡目為九萬四千元，以百分之六計算。</p>
<h3>美鈔呆定金價漲　港滙廣帮供源多</h3>
<p>烚赤昨極為平穩，晨開時因報載消息略有助買論調，升為三三八萬至三四〇萬，央行一有賣胃，市價立吿下游，中途毫無維持，低價遂降至三二四萬，始有實銷維持而稍穩，央行以三二八萬之價，配給九〇條，入後曾回升至三三七萬，市况遂轉呈閑散狀態，在三三〇萬迄三三五萬之間略有起仆，午刻忽傳央行貿意停止而升至三三七七萬左右，午後初穩後疲，自三三九萬降至三三三四萬左右，較前收升五萬，飾金掛卅五萬六，銀元平平，暗息仍在一角半至一角八間。</p>
<p>外幣昨美平港疲，美鈔黑市晨初六千一至六千三，後在六千二至六千四之間徘徊，午後成交更稀，市態呆定，結果與前收相較無甚榮辱，港票因廣帮供意不怠，絨綫帮雖納，亦無力振作，申電報升至八一元半，最後更降至一二〇〇元以下，較前收再跌五十元左右，港匯一二一元，印匯一四七〇元，英匯一九三〇〇元，成交仍僅港匯略有點綴。</p>
<h3>公債平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨更為平穩，成交不過一百餘萬元，統丙晨開一四五〇元，高價一四八〇無，低價一四〇〇元，午刻在一四五〇元以上徘徊，較前收微降二十元，甲乙尙平，丁降一一〇元，戊跌八〇元</p>
<h3>當局將派員　抽查金融業　非法經營決予嚴究</h3>
<p>今晨據本市金融業方面消息，關於本年下半年度各行莊業務結賬，大部均已趕辦完竣，最高財政當局對該業以往經營情形，甚為重視，現將派員來滬辦理抽查工作。據悉當局準備抽查（行莊經營狀况）係鑒於過去滬金融投機氣氛濃厚，且足釀成不穩風潮，為杜絕未來之危機，故此次如查出有非法經營者，決予從嚴究辦。</p>
<h3>個人出售外滙　應得央行核准</h3>
<p>記者頃向外匯審核處探悉：該處近通知指定經營外匯銀行，嗣後對於個人需要出售之外匯，事先應得中央銀行核准云。</p>
<h3>桐油市况穩定　本年貿易平平</h3>
<p>桐油現貨旣少，又値年終，交易已呈停頓，市况亦無變動。回顧本市桐油商業，本年度皆無特殊之盈利，亦無因虧蝕而倒閉者，蓋本市經營桐油商業者，類多歷史悠久，資本雄厚，故雖在不景氣中，亦得勉力維持，桐油為我國對外貿易主要輸出品之一，本年初足度桐油每擔為七〇·〇〇〇國元，以迄年終，每擔價雖在一五〇·〇〇〇元，其上漲程度，的祇一倍，以與其他物價比較，相差頗大，其間為外銷價格所限，當為最大之原因，在本年一至五月間，產地運滬之出口桐油，雖數量並不甚多，但續有到埠，六月以後，產地價格到處皆與滬地出口價格並駕　　，又以阨於運輸，故到貨旣少，經營亦屬不易，後因利息高昂，運費不住上漲，桐油之運輪已成為一必然虧本之交易，如重慶運滬之桐油，在七八月間每擔運費須三萬元，的十倍於上海運至紐約之運費，蓋產地桐油之運輸情形，盡賴人力輸送，陸地運輸費用，實難負荷，即有若干水程可以利用，亦以般隻缺少，輪運困難，外匯第二次調整後，產地桐油價格上漲程度實較滬地漲風為烈，迨至十月間又以華南出口岸之吸引，川漢及湘產桐油，盡往華南輸送，滬地到貨旣無，交易亦極度悽慘。</p>
<h3>喲絨業盤存貨</h3>
<p>昨係國歷除夕，呢絨非惟躉批毫無，即零星交易，亦甚淸淡，店號俱多盤查存貨，騰算賬項，以謀一年的收束，聞本年度呢絨業因吃本重，利息高，公私繳用浩大，各家存貨無不減少，其有實地盈餘者無幾，大半得能渡過禹歷年關，即稱幸運，其退會及收閉和互相併組者大有人在云。</p>
<h3>生產貸款　臨時審核委員會　考慮放寬尺度　商業行莊參加甚少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四戰總處生產專業貸款臨時審核委員會，於昨日下午一時，召開第七次例會，到各委員及專家等廿餘人，財决及四聯總處秘書長徐柏園亦出席參加，席間仍由霍主委主席。討論提案四起：（一）繼續核准貸款五起，共的十餘億元。（二）承轉行莊審核對象方針，各有鬆緊不同，決議指派專家三人，議定公正一致之標準，於下次會議中提出討論。（三）貸款手續，除根據業已頒佈之各種條例為原則外，並擬寬放尺度，其詳細辦法，亦由專家研究中。（四）爲於事後經常考核貨款情形起見，亟擬成立稽緩室。中國家行局每單位推派代表二人，商業行莊推派代表三人，工商轉導處推派代表三人組織之。並由央行推派「人，任總稽核，經常担任考核事宜，會議至三時許始散。</p>
<p>記者旋分訪各界，徵詢對生產貸款之意見。若干商業莊，認為生產貸款業巳核准兩批，總額已逾廿億元，惟大部均中國家行局承放，而向央行轉貼現。商業行莊極少承做。歸納若張意見，不外三點：（一）各行莊貸出利息為四分，向央行轉貼現利息為二分。轉貼現後，央行負扣資金八成，承貸行莊負担二成，折算之下，承貸行莊實得利息為一角二分。然目前各行莊自辦放款利息收入，實于較此為優厚。（二）承貸行莊向央行轉貼現後，與央行二八分担資金，惟實際須負全部借款責任。現開銀行公會，已函生產貸款會，請求解釋該項責任問題。（三）承貸行莊每貸款一筆，至少須塡貸款資金十分之二。如繼續貸出，自身資金容有不敷，故無形中已有限制，不能儘量承貸。</p>
<p>又工商界之意見，則認為目前生產貸款，其押品仍以原料及成品為對象，至機器廠房，以估價辦法未定，實際仍未能作押且條例上更規定貸款工廠，須由承貸行莊派員監管，如有相當利潤，尙有按此例互分之規定，尤為一般工商界所不習慣，又某捲菸廠曾申請貸款，惟被目為奢侈工業，而遭批駁云。</p>
<h3>十二月份燃管會　核配工業用煤　一萬九千餘噸</h3>
<p>燃管會為盡量解決本市煤荒，現正向產煤區大量採購，絡續裝運來滬，該會為謀消弭煤斤及各商囤積起見，除配給煤商業同業公會，統一供應各煤商銷售外，至民營工廠用煤，亦由該會按月配給，一面由煤商業公會組織代配民營工廠用煤管理處，負責登記運送，並於每次配給時，派員分批監督押運赴廠，以防中途舞弊，茲探悉該會十二月份核配各民營工廠用煤計二十四單位，其各業數量如下：機器棉織業三四〇〇噸，造紙業八五〇噸，擴堅業四〇〇噸，機器染織業五八五九噸，像膠製品業一三〇八噸，火柴工業一七一噸，調味粉工業四六五噸，皂燭工業四三六噸，捲烟工業一一四八噸，毛絨紡織整染工業七〇六噸，內衣織造業二八五噸，化學原料工業六二六噸，熱水瓶業四七一噸，機器業二一一噸，製革業六〇噸，玻璃業八七〇噸，繼頭食品業二一二噸，榨油業四〇八噸，綢布染商桑三一六噸油脂業一〇三噸，草呢帽業三〇七噸，針織業一五六噸，製藥業三七四噸，第六區紡織業二五〇噸，以上共計一萬九千三百九十二噸。</p>
<h3>米價堅定油市平疲</h3>
<p>米市南北共到一萬餘石，客方不願急脫，納戶因銀根仍緊，進胃不爽，結果粳米南市早定午懈，北市先疲後定，高貨北梗尙覺立定，中下南粳則軋小千元，秈米到銷兩少，仍無上落，白元因中次居多，回小一二千元，陰元貨湧，下跌二三千元。小麥貨稀穩固，麵粉供求兩平，麩皮轉堅，回昂一二百元，油市桶生油各路到源蟬聯，去化平淡，續疲一二千元至二三千元，桶豆油中檔貨來貨亦多，回低一二千元，惟高檔豆油及簍生油，店胃尙續，依然平定，淸油麻油均乏軒輊，菜油軟化而少神，油市形勢仍在平疲中徘徊，豆餅油頭仍辦，價格步挺一二百元，苞米漲定，蠶豆平庸，赤豆仍少榮辱，黃豆零化尙活，油廠揀巧間津，去化平淡，略昂三五百元，芝蔴廣銷揀高動辦，高貨加一二千元，中關平平，生仁粵銷接連，本街亦動，價格步砌，再漲二三千元。</p>
<p>紗　昨日紗市粗平細俏，二十支較上週末略堅，三十二支細紗，粵帮繼續搜購，漲起五萬至八萬，四十二支雙綫織廠頗有吸納，亦跳十萬，二十支紗因供懸較多，客銷薄弱，欲漲無力，平庸如故。</p>
<h3>雜糧紗布運往台灣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海浙海宙兩輪先後駛台灣，海浙裝去生仁五千四百四十餘包，棉紗一千一百四十餘件，疋頭八百七十餘件，均運基隆，又海宙輪裝去，豆子八百廿包，豆餅二千九百塊，疋頭二百二十餘件，棉紗二十八件，另有雜貨一千餘件，運基隆，又豆餅五千六百塊運高雄。</p>
<h3>絲綢交易清淡</h3>
<p>絲市連朝低回，昨市尙稱平穩，人造絲與週六無甚軒輊。廠絲喊價稍堅，不過交易甚稀，昨市只有Ｅ字等級高檔新貨成交五担，價做四百六十五萬元。其餘均無做開。綢貨被面慘落，大誠被面塲內大量拋售，以致最低價喊二百五十五萬元，尙乏受主。華中縐做三千五百元，次者只做四百五十元，實因銀根奇緊，買戶束手，有以致之。</p>
<h3>腸衣每桶近四百萬元　外廠操縱亟應制止</h3>
<p>據悉：最近紐約腸衣售價，每副仍為美金八角，雖瑞士法郞匯率較高，售價每桶可獲三百六七十萬元，惟與目前滬市成本計算，仍相差甚鉅，茲將該業公會之成本計算表探誌如下：</p>
<p>原料進價淨貨腸衣二五〇〇副，內本鮮貨的二〇％，以五〇〇副每副一四〇〇元計算，計七〇〇〇〇〇元，又客貨的八〇％，二〇〇〇副，扯價每副一二七五元計算，計二五五〇〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>每桶用鹽六〇〇斤，每斤三四五元，計二〇七〇〇〇元，木桶連搪白臘三〇〇〇〇元，襯桶布述縫工一〇〇〇〇元，耗水電房租房捐營業稅等七〇〇〇〇元，車力原料進廠淨貨出廠一六〇〇〇元，人工（平均廠內雇工人十五人，工頭一人，配碼三人灌水七人，下手四人，每月可出淨貨至少三十桶）三一九〇〇〇元，合計成本每桶為三九〇二〇〇〇元。以上成本中銀錢利息經理會計等辦事人員聞支均未計入，因之該業在國際市塲價格未能好轉前，外銷仍極困難，業中人盼政府對該業中之某外商腸廠，故意提高原料（鮮賜）收價，予以取締，並飭令加入公會，俾免從中操縱云。</p>
<h3>市面不景氣　魚行倒廿餘家</h3>
<p>本市經營魚行業務有七十餘家，皆在外灘十六舖一帶，據該業中人談稱：該業戰前頗為發達，目前隨工商業之危機，一月來倒閉者已有廿餘家，究其　結，厥為：（一）行家資金短少，至多亦不過一萬萬元，普通皆為二千至五千萬元，因此多週轉不靈，受高利貸壓迫，而致倒閉，（二）本市行家由外埠運銷之魚類，須經魚市塲抽以每元四分之厘卡，故發展有限，（三）本業前經政府貸款一萬萬元，但受惠者僅為漁市塲及船戶，運銷業甚少實惠，故仍難免資金困難云。</p>
<h3>糖價回升</h3>
<p>昨糖市初平後升公會劃盤現貨中砂白初市為十四萬一千元，旋至三千元，后爲十四萬四千元至四千五百元，棧舉十一萬五千元至八千元，汕提靑開十一萬五千元，高順德靑十一萬五千元，成交三四百包，俱屬開關付款，故價格提高，棉赤十五萬二三千元，五十包，興化白十五萬八千元至六千元，興赤十四萬二千元至四五千元，成交二百餘萬。</p>
<h3>茶市依然沉靜</h3>
<p>英商仁記洋行昨對於高檔陳祁門雖有進一胃，但賣戶則仍以貨稀居奇，故市勢依然岑靜，他若抽珍。珍眉等花色，邇來脫手尙稱不惡，售價亦頗穩秀，至於陳珠茶則存底已將罄，其他各茶，過程大都與上週彷彿。</p>
<h3>經濟部函蘇省府　嚴禁囤積居奇</h3>
<p>〔聯合徽信所訊〕據悉：經濟部前因蘇省地處淪陷，非常時其取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法，未經施用，今雖戰後，然物價仍多波動，非經營商業人士及非本業商人，或本業商人，對於日用重要物品難免無囤積居奇情事，故仍應依法嚴予取締，並規定獎勵密吿辦法，鼓勵檢舉，其應行取締囤積之日用重要物品，種類名稱如下：</p>
<p>（一）糧食類：米，穀，麵粉，高梁，粟，玉米，豆類。</p>
<p>（二）衣着類：棉花，棉紗，棉布，（各種本已棉布，各種漂白染色或印花棉布）麻布（各種本色蔴布，各種漂白染色，或印花蔴布。）皮革。</p>

<p>（五）其他經濟部呈准指定者。聞經濟部業已函請蘇省轉令縣市查照辦理。</p>
<h3>金融消息　大同銀行</h3>
<p>近因年關緊迫及工商界不景氣之影饗，本地銀錢業略有波動，記者向各方面調查，據票據父換所耙錄，河南路北京路口大同銀行及南京路正和銀行，每日票據頭寸軋平後，仍有多餘，並據大同銀行負實人談，該行業務向守正軋，絕未經營投機事業，頭寸準備非常充實云。</p>
<p>建國銀行　本市建國銀行分行於本月二十六日宣吿暫停交換後，昨（三十日）晨已恢復業務，聞此次該行週轉發生問題，乃為投資台糖業務失敗，曾訂購有一千噸之鉅云。</p>
<h3>香港投機家慣技　假電訊竟又出現</h3>
<p>昨日此間有人假造聯合社電報稿，發送各報，企岡擾亂金融市塲一該假電報冒稱西貢電，謂恐怖份子巳攫取越南所有銀行及運輸工具，此種行動顯然出於莫斯科之煽動云云。電報稿紙與聯合社所用者相同，混入華沙與華盛頓之其他三電中一併送至各報。但中文報館四家以送稿方法離奇，看出破綻，聯合社及時接到通吿，宣布其僞造，阻止登載。旋經查出，此乃有計劃運動，企圖使越幣持有者吐售，從中牟利。按今年二月十一日亦有人僞造聯合社消息謂財部宣布美金匯率已改為二千對一，各報不察予以登出，一時法幣大跌，旋經聯合社否認後，市面即吿恢復。</p>
<h3>福與倒閉榮豐跌停　華股市塲交易减少</h3>
<p>昨日證交以國曆除夕之前日，現期與第八期遞交各部均只做前市半日，現期交易，定翌日（卅一日）交割淸楚，以資年度結賬，遞交交易，則定一月六日交割，以便與一月四日開做第九期遞交相銜接，市塲交易减少，人心尙好，金融帮對永紗仍來套利，中途曾俏，後以謠傳某小型股有不穩高勢，臨收急切回跌，晨開因福興倒閉而微降，按福興祥記證券號為交易所第五十八號經紀人，因同時經營黃金交易，附設有信誠昌金號，近以營業失利，昨日忽吿倒閉，該號負責人為吳子蕚及魏冠維云。</p>
<p>開盤以後，一六〇號七八號八三號二一八號咸售，現永紗退至五八九元，遞交見六二〇元低價，後以一九八號一八〇號一四號一四五號一二四號來進，八九號二二九號出現入遞，逐漸上升，二一二號七五號一三七號四七號四號一九七號亦納，十時半後，人心因金融帮除套息外，幷有納胃，塲外市價報高，現永紗升至六三六元，　交見六六三元高價，後一九八號二一八號一五一號七〇號九一號略售，逐漸回挫，中途雖有盤旋，傳某小型股有不穩傳說，加之榮豐由一五一號　至跌停，近午跌勢稍起而見怯疲，午收稍盤，結果較前收計永紗美亞華豐微升，信和新光微挫，景福跌半成强，勤興跌一成强，冷股熒豐跌成半，火柴升一成，餘者絕少開做，遞交永紗信和微升，美亞華直尙平，新光則微降，塲外各股平平。</p>
<p>外股昨尙穩定，怡紗七千元外，雖未能站定，但餘者尙升降互見，結果較前收計會德豐怡啤鋼業微升，怡紗英聯航業紙業微降，業廣獨平。</p>
<h3>美國貨格繹而來　已在途中約有五六十艘　上海台灣不能進口即轉香港</h3>
<p>〔本訊〕嚴係方面息：自美國西海岸海員罷工問題解快後，約有美商船六十艘較華，現已抵達者不過十之一二，其餘均在途中。所裝貨物之中，除善後救濟物資以外，棉花機　日用品均有。但此種情形，不能解釋爲美國因生產過剩，欲以我國為傾銷之對像。事實上，今日美國本國布塲需要甚大，輸出在其總生產量中佔極小之比例。以顏料而論，因供不應求，在美國亦有黑市，我國在美之進出口公司，規模較小者不惜出高價多方搜求，其購進之數量反較大規模之進出口公司為大。以機器而言，本國之需求亦大，今日在美所能購得者，大部均為舊貨；如欲訂購，則交貨期可能在一二年之後。紙張雖有輸出，但本國需要亦殷。美國各大公司為促進其對華商務起見，頗有請我國大規模進出口公司經理其在華交易者，自進口放可制度實施施後，一般經營進口業者行動均在詳細研究之中。記者曾詢問進出口業大士：如來華六十艘商船中之貨物，不能獲得進口許可時，將如何辦理？答稱：大致將在香港進口，然後相機輸入我國市塲。</p>
<h3>絲綢外銷特委會　進行順利</h3>
<p>頃據關係方面表示，當局關注本市絲織業衰落，經中　公司與國家銀行數度商討後，擬籌組絲綢外銷特種委員會，以人造絲及生絲原料貸予各絲織廠代織其業務上外銷之拓展，技術上之改進事，均由委員會全部予以監管，該業方面，同時亦着手組織絲織產銷公司，齊金定為國幣五億元，由同業中優秀廠商參加入股，茲已全部認足，現正與各關係方面商討中，惟茲事體大，必須統盤　劃，並經當局核准後才能付諸實施，聞經數次磋商後，意見頗為接近，約於明年二月間，當可實現。</p>

<p>齊大沿革　略云：本校創設於民國紀元前四十七年，迄今已歷八十二載。初係美國長老會狄考文博士創設文學館於登州，繼與靑州浸禮會廣德書院大學班合併，改名廣文學堂，遷校於維縣，旋美國長老會聶會東博士在濟設立之醫學堂，英國漫禮會在青開辦之國學堂，在濟南合併為共和醫道學堂，民國六年，上述各校乃在濟南正式合併，改稱齊魯大學。民十二，北京葉北女醫學校亦合併齊大醫科，而成男女合校。民十八，神科脫離，改設文理醫三學院。民國二十年十二月十七日，奉敎部令核准立案。</p>
<p>抗戰期間　抗戰軍興後，本校奉命西遷，廿七年秋，與成都華西大學合作，本校即在蓉復校，幾經奮鬥不僅原有各院系及國學研究部，均一一恢復，且爲適應客觀環境之需要，復會設製葉學系，及醫科研究所寄生蟲系，在濟教職員亦多分途內來，基礎漸固。三十年珍珠港事件爆發後，英美籍敎職員原在濟南設立之短期職榮校，宣吿停辦後，亦相率西來，於是本校陣容，更趨完整强固。</p>
<p>勝利以後　本校力謀復校今春派由孫敎務長來濟主持，承王兼主席等之協助，業已漸復舊觀，計校舍方面，濟南自失陷後，敵即將該校據為軍醫院，故校舍外殼，大致完整，級半年修葺，緊急需要，已初步完成。圖書方面，敵侵佔後，初擬焚燬，後經交涉送廣智院封存，今幸尙得大部保存，即全國罕有之繕本珍品「泉苑」，亦得完璧。儀器方面，損失較重，如本校原有顯微鏡的二百架，現僅剩廿架，如就現有學生論，勉可敷用。學生方面，各院系所有一年級新生，一律在濟招生，且已於十月一日正式開學上課，至二年級以上學生，暫行留蓉在華大寄讀，一部敎員亦留蓉任教，待交通恢復，再返濟復校。現在蓉校計有敎職員廿一人，學生二百六十七人。至濟南本校方面，文理醫三學院一年級生共二一五人，先修班五十人，二年級七年級每班自二人至廿六人不等，合約三百人。</p>
<p>今後計劃　繼由該校孫敎務長恩三報吿今後計劃：（一）醫學院正延攬中外著名學者前來任敎，並已獲一一百五十病床之附屬醫院的全部設備，一俟交通恢復，即可次第完成。（二）下年度起，文理兩學院擬合併為文理學晥，原有各學系，將予調整，無綫電專修科亦一併恢復。（三）增設農工學院，以期協助山東的工業化。</p>
<p>教育第一　旋由王兼主席致訓，首謂齊大復員，較其他大學爲早，實齊大光榮，亦山東光榮。繼謂：國家之強衰，視乎教育之發達與否，當此建國期間，教育第一，吾人應特別重視教育建設。王主席致訓畢，復由李教育廳長泰華致詞，校友代表演說。吳校長致謝詞後，典禮即於大雪繽紛及莊嚴之校歌聲中，宣告禮成。（本報駐濟南特派員范式之寄）</p>

<p>寒冷的暖流</p>
<h3>杭州藝文動態</h3>
<p>— 廿六日杭州訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>杭州是靠春秋兩季來滋養的，西子也就在這兩個季節裏度着她的黃金時代。在四方八面的人」車子一車子滿滿地載到杭州來，爲西子送一些化粧的脂粉之資。</p>
<p>夏天的杭州，雖然熱得厲害，但在夜幕罩下來的時候，總有很多人，在湖濱納凉。只有冬夭，才是西子最冷落的季節，寥寥無幾的人蜷縮着匆匆地跑過湖邊，寂寞沉悶代表了整個的西子。今年雖然浙江沒有戰亂，但每個人心坎裹還真是沉沉的，而整個杭州的工商業不景氣，公敎人員大學生等智識份子在過着艱難的歲月，衣單衾薄，正不知怎樣來消磨這冬天的長夜？</p>
<p>初次舉行　文藝晚會</p>
<p>物質上是困乏的，在全國普遍文藝低潮的時候，杭州的精神也是貧血的，我曾以「杭州娛樂荒」爲題，爲文充分說明正當娛樂的缺乏，總算沒有白喊，星期球會是成立了，映着衰褪了時代顏色影片的幾家影院，也改映了最新出產的國片，迎紫路已無傀儡戲的踪影，市當局注意着含有毒素的娛樂。但，這些精神的食糧沒有經過烹調的，並不能激起杭州的熟情，所以心坎裏依然是沉沉地，冷風襲來時感着一陣陣寒戰。　很多年靑的朋友，於是在舉行了第一次文藝晚會之後，復鼓起餘勇，舉辦了第二次的文藝晚會。正如所說：「在這靜止的湖面上，想投下一塊小小的石子，激起一個小小的彼紋，在這連天冰凍的氣候裏，烘起一絲絲溫暖，來融熱這冷寞的空氣。」　這一次，眞是够熱鬧了，靑年會四樓的大禮堂上，擠滿了人，的略計來，有七百多顆活潑的心，這裏包括浙大，之大，藝專的敎授和學生，新聞記者以及公務人員；老戲劇家熊佛西特地從上海趕來參加，電影工作者陶熊和歡陽飛鶯適時在杭，也準時蒞會了。一陣陣輕快熱烈的掌聲，一陣陣愉快的歡笑聲，一陣陣同情的嘆息聲，每個人都感着興奮，熱烈，每個人都感着溫暖，是的，精神的溫暖有勝於物質的溫暖，精神上食糧的渴求有勝於物質上食糧的渴求，你只要看這一决的文藝晚會，足足開了四個半鐘點，但沒有一個人先離開的，有的還是沒有坐位站着的呢？這可見杭州智識羣對精神上感到的飢渴。</p>
<p>可以這樣說吧，文藝晚會已在杭州燃起了融融之火使杭州能得着精神上的溫暖。</p>
<p>之江大學　校慶紀念</p>
<p>之江大學也適時舉行了百年紀念的校慶，校長李培恩說：「希望同學們不要做官發財。」大學敎育本來是研究敎育，他們應該重視眞理，推崇學術，這眞理和學術，便是人類精神溫暖的源泉。這次之江的百年校慶有展覽會，有球類比賽，有話劇，有音樂會，他們在風景綺麗錢江之濱的山巔上，今後應該有幾位傑出的學術家出現。來溫暖這西子湖附近的人羣。同時我們要求之江大學這些文藝表現的才能立刻展布到社會上來。</p>
<p>歌詠表現　打破沉寂</p>
<p>浙江省戲劇歌詠團正當這個時候，也在西子湖濱的杭州師範禮堂裏上演萬世師表，他們已經過相當時期的排練，預備來擊破這杭州久已沉寂的劇壇，在世界大都會——上海話劇運動衰微的時候，杭州這個城市，居然倔强的來試演話劇，這不僅晨給予廣大的羣衆以精神上的食糧，而且使話劇工作同志們得着無比的溫暖。</p>
<p>劇社復員　劇運展開</p>
<p>杭州的話劇運動將不斷地展開呢？藝專劇社已經復員了並已開排第一個戲，劇本已選定爲「雷雨」，同時浙江大學外文系戲劇班正在籌組浙大話劇團預備上演話劇，浙大這輩小伙子們，已在文藝晚會上表演了卓越的話劇才能，將來一定可以更精采的演出。以這三個强勁的話劇團體來推動杭州市的話劇運動，只要他們在不怕失敗不容灰心的信念下，一定可以有所成就的。</p>
<p>本報舉行　大展覽會</p>
<p>本報杭州辦事處，在這年冬歲底的時候，也正發起着一次比較大規模的展覽會，時間在三十六年的元旦起，這次展覽會已獲得總館的同意，已由總館動員人力積極準備，內容的一部份將爲本報歷年的文獻，另一部份爲珍貴的時事照片。一個有悠久歷史的報紙，他可以反映時代的需求和時代的使命，在她的文獻裏，更可瞭見時代的進步。所以有很多人奇怪這個展覽會爲什麼不先在上海南京舉行，而偏要先在杭州開呢？我們的回答是：「道冷寂的杭州冬天，我們願意也投一根柴枝，來溫暖她的精神啊！」</p>
<p>木刻書畫　傅將展覽</p>
<p>聽說還有一個木刻展覽會書畫展覽會要舉行，正在舉行的一個集郵展覽會，是在鼓樓的私立流通圖書館，這個展覽會裏分集郵與集鈔兩部份有各國的與中國的，表徵了中華民國的歷史性，集鈔部份收集中國各種眞僞的鈔票，表徵了中華民國以往浪亂的社會在漸進到統一的國家途程中。這個展覽會是流通圖書館主辦的，館長是陳獨醒先生，他是以郵局職薪來創辦這個圖書館的，現在這位滿頭白髮的文化老戰士也站出來了，他也振奮地來活動了。</p>
<p>以上，都是在這冬天裏杭州市的文藝活動，這些活動比之於靜止湖水中的波紋也罷，比之於黑暗之中的星星之火也罷，比之於冰凍的大地一股股暖流也罷，總之，杭州的冬天，令人感着並不太枯寂，並不太冷寞，這微微的暖意使精神上感着困乏的人露着一絲會心的微笑。</p>
<h3>南國初寒</h3>
<p>— 廣州十六日航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>當江南各地紛紛飄雪的時候，這裏還是驕陽隨處，溫暖如春，沒有一些寒意。可是到了最近這一週來，天氣却忽然轉變，連日朔風虎虎，細雨罪霏，寒暑表降至四十度左右，本來也不算怎麼厲害，不過在這個號稱「熱風之都」的城市，一切都沒有充份的禦寒設備，所以經這一股寒流侵襲，便使整個市面冷落起來；入夜後，市民多蟄伏不出，商店也提早閉門：這雖說是南國的初寒，也一片嚴冬的景象了！</p>
<p>富貴季節</p>
<p>冬天似乎是屬於富貴人士的季節。冬天降臨，太太小姐們新置的價値百餘萬的海勃龍大衣，便有了出風頭的機會；而大人先生們的美式裝備，就算它是西洋人的剩餘物資，也何嘗不可以對瑟縮街頭的老百姓來驕傲一下哩；高貴的酒樓，更早就爲高貴的人士準備好了什麼「菊花會五蛇」「禦寒生　」「龍虎鳳大集會」之類的名貴菜色，這正好圍爐煮酒，藉以消寒。所以嚴冬到來，各大酒家無不利市百倍，雖然「蛇羹」每席動輒百數十萬元，但在大人先生們的眼裏，亦算得什麼？根據市稅捐處的調查，每月各大酒家消費的數量，總額在一億三千萬元以上，這龐大的數字，也不可謂不驚人吧！還有，舞塲也是大人先生在冬天裏最好消遣的地方；悠揚的爵士樂聲，正足鼓起紳士太太們的舞興；雖說廣州工商業不振，社會經濟瀕於破產，而舞廳裏却擁擠不堪，消費者大不乏人！目前這裏較大的舞塲約有十餘家，而跳舞學院更不勝其數，聽說還有幾家大規模的舞廳正在籌備，預算趕在聖誕節和新年前後開幕的哩！</p>
<p>悲慘一隅</p>
<p>可是，在冬之到來，社會還有另外悲慘的一面：由於天氣驟寒，一般貧苦市民，多是寒衣未備，莫不憂形於色，無法解決；就是那些小公務員們』以一切禦寒物品無不價格奇昂，也是可望而不可即，那祇有仍然穿着單衣，瑟瑟縮縮在街頭亂跑而已。尤其是露宿在街頭的難民，用那破碎的蔴包，裏纏着他們枯瘦的身子，在凜冽的寒風之下，使他們頭也不敢伸出來。這種難民雖然還沒有正確的統計，但我們在任何一個繁盛的地區，在那些高樓大厦的底層，到處都可以看到他們蜷伏在那裏，那種飢寒交迫，凄慘之狀，實在難以形容；不過在高樓大厦出入的人們，已經「熟視」，所以宛如「無睹」吧了！據衛生當局統計：就在這一週間，掩理路屍共有六十一具之多，那末，還有未經掩埋的呢！總之這幾天來，因凍餓而至斃命的難民，估計每天總在十五人以上哩！所以在這幾天內，先後的發生了千餘歸國難僑，包圍善救分署請求發給寒衣，和難民數十强搶賑米等事件來，這都足以顯示這個問題的嚴重，因爲他們爲了使殘喘能够久延，他們便不能不掙扎了！</p>
<p>冬令救濟</p>
<p>當局對於這個問題，可以說早就顧慮到了，冬令救濟會早在本（十二）月三日已正式成立，看來計劃是相當週到的：這計劃是設庇寒所二十三所，每所可收容一百人至五百人；另施贈棉衣及蔴包衣各五千件，並設施飯站五處，以外還有火災，疾病，小本貸款等臨時救濟；預算全部經費七千六百萬元。可是照現在這幾天來看，這個會工作的推進未免太慢了！現在凍斃的餓俘已日見增多，然施飯站要到十八日才開始，庇寒所的地址還未完全找到，而那筆鉅額的經費還要用各種方法去籌集，祇恐怕開得幾次會來，經過一番的討論然後議決，議決之後還待實行，那時需要救濟的貧苦難民，他們早已「自行解決」了！</p>
<p>市面波動</p>
<p>至於工商業方面，週來波動最大的，應該算是金融市塲，眞可謂瞬息萬變，進展驚人；就在一週以內，黃金從卅四萬跳到四十二萬五，港幣由九八二進至一三六〇，美鈔亦自四七〇〇而躍至六三〇〇，在這種瘋狂狀態之下，相信有不少人喜，亦有不少人悲吧！除此以外，其他的工商業，都無不陷於不景氣的危機中；由於舶來品充斥市面，而土貨生產品又品質低劣，無從與之競爭，復以勞工糾紛日多，工資提高，不能適應一般人脆弱的購買力，形成市道滯銷，生產日减；據估計：廣州工業自復員以來，陷於停頓者已達百分之六十。所以工商業資金旣無出路，一部份的投機商人，便轉移向高利貸放方面去活動，按目前情形；貸出一百萬元三個月後即可獲利一百萬元，這樣時暫而利大，那還有誰去投資正當的工商業呢？所以目前這裘的所謂「地下錢莊」，至爲活躍。有不少廠商，當這年關吿緊，銀根短絀，正感窮於應付，而專放高利貸之投機份子，更每每乘人之危，一下週轉不靈，便祇有倒閉；因高利貸影響而倒閉的商號，週來已日有所聞，再挨近農曆年底，恐更不堪設想了！</p>
<p>厲行冬季防</p>
<p>談到治安，本來在這冬防時期，最爲嚴重；但在軍警當局厲行冬防辦法之下，連夜抽查戶口和加派軍警巡邏，使市面治安，總算差强人意；雖然按市警局在十一月份內所辦理的盜匪案，亦達二百餘宗，可是比起香港那種到處發生炸彈案的恐怖情形，這裏顯然是寗謐得多了！不過，這裏也有幾件事頗使一部份市民，惶惶不可終日的，第一就是取締小販問題：市政當局爲貫澈整飭市容計劃，對街頭小販，實行嚴厲取締。雖然當局有指定地點給他們擺賣，可是據統計全市小販數目近二十萬人，而劃定的市塲有限，難免無「僧多粥少」現象，如此則一都份小販將會因此發生生活上的恐慌了！</p>
<p>兵役問題</p>
<p>其次兵役問題，大家都不知道服兵役是光榮義務；致使徵兵消息一宣布，役齡的壯丁無不寢席不安，更有一部份壯丁準備萬一中了籤時，即逃往香港暫避；省商業協進會更以復員後工商業基礎未穩，遽行征召兵役，誠恐人心惶惶，相率逃避，影響市面繁榮爲理由，向當局請求緩召一年；同時本市征額爲一千二百人，現已入營者有五百餘人，尙欠六百餘人，該會願鼓勵志願壯丁入營，補足征額，那便不用抽籤徽集，但當局認爲與兵役法使人人有服兵役義務之旨不符，未便決斷；所以該會連日商計，幾番請願，還未有星空極速。最後一項，就是要全市商店攤派十二億元警費義捐問題，這本來是經市商會通過，在半年內集足此數。用作協助政府革新警政，鞏固治安，令全市商民能安居樂業，法本至善；不過在這工商業不景氣中，各商店應付這個年關，已感力絀；因使目前對這第一個月兩億元之數，實有心有餘而力不足之感；而以後或當更難募集了！所以對上述這幾個問題，大家都盼望當局能够善爲處理，免引起市民的反感，不然對整個社會秩序，便更難以維持了！</p>

<h3>淮南新礦塔　在砌造中</h3>
<p>— 蕪湖二十日訊　本報特派員康風</p>
<p>我們中國社會的封建性一直鼓勵在地面上建塔，因爲那是對權威服從，對神鬼迷信的標誌，地上的塔建築不已，石工瓦匠就很少有機會去造地下的塔。</p>
<p>在淮南礦區，一個在砌造中的新三號井啓示了我上面的感覺，我看到井口吊索把安放着石塊的吊台落下井底，又把井底挖起的碎石泥士吊出來的景象不覺聯想到造塔工程。</p>
<p>這個直徑五公尺浙三號井要用石塊砌二百公尺深的井圈圍牆，然後用水泥塗凝在石牆的外面，道個礦井要開成挖出五公尺直徑二百公尺高的一座塔身這麼粗高的泥土與廢石，時問，搬運勞動，砌牆勞動及石塊水泥就是必需條件，六個月不是太短，道一個塔在二百天後就可以從塔底冒出地層下的賞賜，公司裏對這個新三號井計劃着出七百噸煤一天，那時候，淮南地下新塔的貢獻遠比用同樣石塊去造一座地上的塔大！</p>
<p>廣州六榕才花塔　（本報特派員梁風寄）</p>
<p>那天夜晚，我搭乘到礦區來運煤的空煤車進入礦區時，東礦裏的煉焦爐在暗夜露天裏燃冒的紅光給這個凄凉的礦區描出一幅橘色勞動圖。　也還是由於山東棗莊中興煤礦的焦炭生產停頓，所以京滬翻砂廠就向淮南伸出求援的手，現時淮南煤能以煉焦的只有東礦煤可用，十八座大小煉爐在露天曠塲上，有的剛出淸煉成的焦炭，有的正在紅光四冒，自焚着由煤變焦，三噸煤煉成焦炭一噸，售價五十萬元。每月只產三百噸，不過淮南礦這一勞作是爲了勉任中興煤礦的不濟，淮南對煉焦似不大有趣味，因爲煤質不太宜於煉焦的。</p>
<p>礦工生活印象</p>
<p>我除了在礦井區域看到礦工們工作形態、還單獨到礦工工塲裏去訪問，我所訪問的工房在員工住宅試最靠近的地方，張友賢工程師說那是礦工工房，三千幢中最凄苦的一區，爲的讓一個新聞記者接觸到最痛苦的一羣去體會這個巨人體系虧虛部份。</p>
<p>我去的時間在下午三點半，中午一班人去上工了，做下半夜夜工的人在睡覺，上半夜夜工的工人正在吃飯，我看到的一羣工人有挖煤工人，有推車工人及地下木匠。他們的臉上顏色黃黃的，體力還壯，都是皖北人。他們吃的飯是一種硬而冷的鍋巴飯，有一碗豆芽與鹹菜，十來隻蝦子像珍品放在另一碗底，他們蹲在地上吃，土地就是飯桌，可以一眼看出他們不能談營養，只要能吃飽肚子就不易了。</p>
<p>衣裳是舊棉短襖，二丈見方的二房，其中一半高出一尺的土地就是放稻草與一條又髒又薄的棉被床舖了，從這個睡處你也不能設想是否會有甜睡光臨他們疲累的身上來，自然，白雪公主也不會進入這不止七名的老幼礦工的工房，來爲他們打掃洗刷一下凄凉貧苦的住處。</p>
<p>礦工們的全部景象都放在眼前，沒有皮箱，抽屜，衣櫉，儲藏室，保險櫃爲他們的物質財產存留一份秘密，而且他們的精神倉庫也是洞開的，你聽：</p>
<p>「我是做大工的（即挖煤工人，安放坑道支柱的木匠等，）每天工資二千五百元。」</p>
<p>「我是做小工的（即在礦井下招煤，拖煤筐）每天工錢一千六百元。」</p>
<p>「以前公司裏發煤，一人一個月發一筐，可以够燒飯用，以後日要在工錢中扣八千五百元一筐了。」</p>
<p>「七萬元一個月，除了吃飯，就不剩什麼了！」</p>
<p>這是幾個沒有妻室的礦工，隨後我又到一處正在用蘆梗築牆的工房附近去，女人們說：「俺們是避淮河水災的，家中房屋淹了，地裏一粒也不收，所以逃出來先做工再說。」</p>
<p>這地皮是工房地區，築房的蘆梗由包工頭供給的，包工頭招他們來做工，首先得給他們解決住的問題，這批新到的災民礦工到頗有些財產，每家總有二三口紅木箱。</p>
<p>這裏的礦工總數的爲一萬人，以山東籍最多，原因是山東棗莊中興煤礦的包工頭因棗莊道一年在共軍手中，不能立足，都到了淮南來放包礦井挖煤工作。棗莊礦工也就隨着南下。其次爲河南省藉，再其次爲皖北淮河沿岸水災試及黃泛水災區的災民，礦區所在的懷遠縣本地人很少，本地人多半是做土地上的勞作，窮到一無所有就幹土匪去了，沒有誰肯下到礦井裏做一名旣苦又窮的礦工！</p>
<p>當然，由於礦區的設備已現代化，工房裏有電燈以及自來水龍頭，這是安徽以及普遍的中國鄉村所享受不到的，但一盞五支光的電燈黃光照着工房的暗淡景象只更加凄凉，淸潔的自來水也洗不凈每天下礦的礦工手險身上所染的煤塵。</p>
<p>我當然把我的見聞問到礦上負責人，像張友賢工程師他是在礦的技術上內行的人，對於礦工的實得工資與公司所發的工資差額，（譬各說公司給予的工資是三千餘元一工，工人由包工頭手中領到爲二千餘元），他認爲與礦井裏一部份包工的存在凡有關係現在公司正在把大包工（每一包工頭約有工人百名者，）化爲小包工，同時勸導工人自已組建勞動合作班來自己管理下井採掘的工作以與公司取得直接關係，以避免中間層的花費。張友賢工程師關於工人實得工資部份還有不補充材料，那是每人每天有二斤半麵粉，每月發八千五百元煤費供工人領買礦上規定八千五百元一筐的煤作燒飯煮水用。</p>
<p>社會部組訓司派了一位段在指導組織工會礦上自然樂意政府專管勞工行政部份的專家能以爲礦工福利盡一份力，所以各礦井各部份礦工的代表人正在被推出籌組工會。</p>
<p>我的看法淮南礦主並不是私人資本家而是一羣技術專家與舊礦時代的老人手，在對礦工的關係上也是力求能以養得住這些辛勞的吃苦人，譬如，田家菴正在建設一個麵粉廠，成後可月產麵粉二萬四千袋平價供應礦工與路工需要，三千幢工房不乏破爛者，正在以十餘億元造新工房供應現住破屋的礦工，這些技術家雖然對於勞資關係不太專門，但他們都是感情豐盛的正義人物，人類之間的同情會燃燒他們隨時把這個煤礦王國政策執行到普惠礦工方而去！</p>

<h3>淮南煤的前途</h3>
<p>淮南煤在山東煤以及唐山開灤煤不能供應京滬工業電業交通需用的缺乏時代提供了每月四萬噸的煤斤，在這一年的支特作用上大於任何其他方面的供獻，可是淮南煤礦上的人士不敢洩露這一功勞，只在淮河水畔靜悄悄的生存，發展，記者，煤產已能達五萬四千噸一月了，生產綫還在像物價一般高的上昇着。</p>
<p>淮南礦的儲量據日本人的估計是在五千萬噸，以上大通礦開採三十年，淮南煤礦開採十六年，估計採出這煤在一千萬噸以上剩餘的四千萬噸煤藏，倘若一年採三百萬噸，十三年時光這個礦里煤層就到了窮盡時分，當然，目前產量不過年產六十萬噸，所以可以有五倍於此的悠長時光留在礦的未完歷史上。</p>
<p>爲了延續礦的生涯，所以在淮南盆地的北半部曲綫上，地質專家資委會的探測處長謝家榮已與淮南礦局的柴登榜二氏在距九龍崗二十公里的鳳臺縣新莊子，探測出了新煤層。關於此點，容俟另文報道。</p>
<p>淮南礦的社會史如何發展，這自然要在整個中國社會進步中去尋求的，牠雖然被古老的黃色淮水包流着，就像安徽鄕村的落後與封建性非常濃厚一般，但產業的新風一定要由這些身受現代敎育的技術幹部渲染在目前還甚凄暗的礦地！</p>
<h3>設市前夕　蚌埠市政</h3>
<p>— 廿五日蚌埠訊·三報特派員康風</p>
<p>津浦鐵路</p>
<p>徐浦段中點蚌埠設市政府的前夕，這個安徽都市人口最多的地方情形如何，頗爲各方矚目，特簡述於後：</p>
<p>蚌埠是在安徽北部的大河淮河下游灣曲處發展起來的，有了津浦鐵路經過於斯，設站於斯之後，淮河流域千萬石雜糧的輸出，四百萬石食鹽的每年輸入，都必需解蚌埠作爲一個總樞紐，這個小市集經過數十年的發展，就成爲今日二十六萬人口集居的商業重點，由於道地方交通方便以及工資低廉，距工業原料產地很近，這個商業地區在近二十年來又插樹起高大的姻囪，四十家香烟工廠，二家大規模的麵粉廠，一家大植物油廠在淮河畔建立着生產的機輸。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，安徽省政府在這地方成立了市政籌備處，先僅轄有市警察局，三十五年四月成立工務局，工務局長張學新着手市區工務時根本沒有經費可用，他好笑自己像一個執掃帚的淸道夫，只有勞作，而無足够使用的淸道工具。</p>
<p>八年浩劫</p>
<p>日本人留下的蚌埠是下水道不通，路面破損，垃圾像小山，高踞市區各處散發臭氣。電燈如鬼火暗淡，張學新局長旣有這麼多苦工等着他，他又是一個第一次出來做事業的年靑人，就不斷的用些苦辦法去逐一整頓。</p>
<p>他的辦法是皖東北共軍區逃出災民有勞動力，安徽善救分署有救濟麵粉，他做一個居間人把勞動力與麵粉配合來做成淸整蚌市市政的動力，六個月以來，下水道逐段疏浚，挑出泥土二千噸去塡補市郊窪地。下水道暢了，街道修補了，垃圾也挑出去塡充了窪地，另外在蚌山公園以南，把連接火車站與淮河船塘之間的小路擴修爲一條坦直的幹路，這條路爲了祝賀蔣主席六十華誕，定名中正路，倘若知這火車站與淮河船塘在蚌埠的效用，當然也知道這條坦直的中正路今後在蚌埠市郊區交通上的作用，張學新所望該路日後成爲蚌市的「南京路」。（上海最繁盛街道。）</p>
<p>蚌市電燈</p>
<p>戰前原有七基羅瓦特發電機，可是日本人搬去了牠，現在只剩二百五十基瓦發電機一部，但蚌埠公商用電月達三萬度，超出負荷，燈光就暗如鬼火。現由皖善救分署代向聯總撥買了一部五百基瓦發電機，便爲二億五千萬元，八個月付淸價款。這電機已在裝設，年底可以放光，蚌市電燈及電力可以告一解決。</p>
<p>在夏季淮河漲水時，水位超過民二十年水位二公分，由于春季預培了淮堤二萬工力，所以堤未決潰，市區亦慶覺水淹，蚌埠原爲鳳陽，靈壁，懷遠三縣交界的三不管地區。</p>
<p>市府成立</p>
<p>成立市府後可以管轄四一六方市公里範圍今後蚌市市政建設如修建淮河碼頭開辦自來水廠，建立現代交通路系，擴充電力供應，都不是過去半年來窮辦法所能勝任，市政處時代每月籌措市警察局八百名員警的薪餉都够心焦額爛，蚌埠市政府在三十六年元旦要成立了，但一筆市政建設以及擴充辦事機構用人的開支如何去張羅呢？免不了又壓到二十六萬市民身上來。蚌埠是商業地區，二十六萬人民自然會把這些市政經費負担轉放在進出口貨物上交給更廣大地區的消費者去分祖，蚌埠市政府成立以後，記者所望不要浪費百姓身上抽來的捐稅，做一件事，就會對蚌市工商業與居民有一份好處才是。</p>
<h3>聯合國科學文教局　準備進行大同偉略</h3>
<p>— 五日航訊　本報巴黎特約記者宏負</p>
<p>世界事物之進步，莫不由簡陋而日趨繁複，在二十五年以前，國際聯合會召集之時，匆匆踏進會塲，瞥見文檔之錯互，已苦條緒之紛紜，彼時初預盛會之人，乃如劉姥姥進大觀園，目迷五色，不知所措。孰料二十五年后之國際機構，規模更大，名色更多，若非迎頭趕上新潮流，自將有迫奔莫及之歉。默察前后二十五年兩國際不同之點，則彼時所謂『國聯』，在大會之後方，辦事分爲六股，（一）法律，（二）專門，（三）裁抑軍備，（四）國聯度支，（五）婦人問題及麻醉毒，（六）政治。計除第二項專門股外，大抵爲政治之辯論，細按之乾枯乏味，彼時專門設施之疏缺，無可諱言。今則旣有安全理事，弱小民族等等監護之理事，替代裁軍政治各股，復知於有裨人羣福利前途之專門事功，加以充實，而十一項專門之同時並舉，尤以『聯合國之科學文教局，』爲往歲國聯所未一見之新猷。誠以未來世界和平之求得永久維持，須有相輔相成之兩要政，兼程共進。其第一件要政，即謂凡遇戰爭危害之發生，小者須藉國際法庭之裁斷，消弭各國間之糾紛，大者須召開聯合國大會，全全世界能力，相機應付，共起制裁。至若第二件要政，即期對全世界人羣幸福，預作卓具遠見之設施，務使各國之間，互相尊重，互相了解，此乃世界和平之根柢，亟宜培植於平時。比較論之，一九一九年而後所賴以保和平者，僅致力於上述兩件中之第一件，營營者皆政治空談，一切太疏簡，最近一九四五年以後之求保和平，兼致力於上述兩件中之第二件，（本報聯合國機構鳥瞰圖）遂當以科學文敎局，爲和平方案之主要工具，是局準備進行之大同偉略，劃爲『臨時』與『永久』之兩大綱。其具臨時性質者，即爲第二歐戰淪陷區之文敎復興，早已見諸實踐，而其所當永久存在之企岡，則應分作若干小組，此中儘多一新全世界觀聽之妙緒創聞，可爲智識階級中人，尋求意想不到之炷益與利便。</p>

<h3>教孩子賭博？</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>我時常發現孩子們在親長玩牌的時候，喜歡站在牌台邊觀看批評，像是津津有味的樣子，奇怪的是親長們也不去禁止他們。有時，我甚至看見媽媽有事呌兒子代打，並且還很驕傲地稱讚她孩子的敏慧和精明。這似乎是件小事，其實這對於孩子將來的行為和前途上實在有着嚴重的影嚮。</p>
<p>誰都知道賭博是壞習慣，親長們誰也不願意他們的孩子學會賭博；但事實上由於親長的疏忽反而敎導了孩子們。孩子的幕倣性强，記憶力好，看見父母們玩牌常然也有一種好奇，於是便站在旁邊一聲不嚮地學習了。幾次之後，也許還沒待父母們發覺，他們小小的心靈裏却已學得差不多了。到那時，即使禁止，也無濟於事！</p>
<p>對於不願意孩子們學會賭博的家長們，我希望你們能多買些有敎育意味的書籍和玩具給你們的孩子，以免他們感到無聊而去觀牌；同時在你們玩牌或作其他賭博的當兒，應該禁止孩子們觀看學習，至於已經學會了的孩子，你們最好能把賭博之害說給他們聽，並且絕對不允許他們有任何賭博的行為！孩子們的好壞全在幼小時的敎導，望每位賢明的家長都能注意。</p>
<h3>美國家庭婦女</h3>
<p>— 碧浪</p>
<p>結婚前後生活大不同</p>
<p>在美國，極少數的貴婦那種奢華安逸的生活神情，當然我們是望慶莫及的。可是大多數的中等階級的家庭婦女，也和我們中國的家庭婦女一樣，感覺經濟困難，但是她們的婦女比我們有本領，有能耐，一切的家庭處理比我們要高明得多多。</p>
<p>美國中等家處的婦女，在結婚前，果然像我們從他們的電影裏看來，書上讀來，鍍過金的博士先生們聽來：她們是極安適，行為放縱的，但是一結婚之後，她們就得負担起一家的會計，操作，以及將來的兒童敎養全部責任。她們決不僱人以自代，她們的行動非常的敏捷，工作也異常約有條理，按步就班，不輟不懈。每日淸晨，她們就得起身預備早點，等丈夫出門工作去，她們就收拾房子，洗滌衣服，如果右小孩子的話（不滿二歲的嬰兒），到十時左右便把小車推往公園去遊憇，自巳一面編結絨綫，午飯之後，又得料理一切雜務，再推小車出去玩玩。因為在美國，除了一些貴族階級可以有高樓大厦住外，中等人家是極少有良好舒暢的住宅的，所以不得不使孩子出外換換空氣。</p>
<p>她們更有着一種看管小孩子的特種技能天才，她們工作時絕不將孩子帶抱在手上，總讓他躺在搖床上。而這些小孩很少啼哭的，特別是晚上，總是很安靜的睡着。</p>
<p>美國的大多數家庭主婦，表現得十分穩健，祇因經濟要靠丈夫維持，所以她們最大的任務，就是如何使丈夫快樂，以至如何使家庭舒適，融洽。這與我們中國的一般祇會消耗，不會理家的所謂「新女性」，眞有天壤之別哩！而且她們也很能了解丈夫的苦衷，有時在家庭經濟恐慌下，她們也會抬起了肩頭，出外找事，而從不會有怨言。在美國，夫婦不睦相駡，相打，這根本是沒有的事。</p>
<h3>我理想中的妻子</h3>
<p>— 鋼</p>
<p>人生的過程彷彿是漫漫的長途，在這漫漫長途中，誰都希冀有一個終身伴侶。因此，我也希望找到一個理想中的妻子。</p>
<p>理想中的賢妻，應該具有健全的體格，前進的思想，中等的學問，快樂的胸襟，溫和的性格，勤儉的美德。這些優點是絕對需要的，因為這些優點足以帮助丈夫在精神上獲致安慰，在事業上獲取成功，也必需如此才能造成甜蜜愉快的家庭。</p>
<p>我並不企求她必須有怎樣美麗的面貌，因為我知道美麗的姿色並不是維繫夫妻之間情愛的條件。但許多人都對它誤解了，以為擇妻必須先擇美麗的，而把品性的美德忽略，前人所謂「自古紅顏多薄命」，正顯示出了一對理想中的終身伴侶並不必依靠美麗的面貌。夫妻之間情感能够維繫永久的條件，是「敬愛誠懇」四個字，如果缺少了它，就難得到家庭幸福的樂趣。她應該要懂得所謂終身伴侶，是人生過程中相處最長久的朋友，雙方要做到相敬相愛，推心置腹的地步，祇有永遠安慰，相互諒解，才能渡過盛衰莫測的一生。如果夫婦之間的兩顆心不能聯繫在一起，在失意時埋怨憤怒，不加安慰和鼓勵；在得意時恣意享受，不加覺悟和驚惕，那麼美麗的家庭以及夫婦的情感，遲早有破裂的一天。</p>
<p>她的家庭不必富有，最適當的是具有職業經駝的婦女，因為她不但有着自立的經騐，同時對社會上的一切多少有些瞭解，人情世故自然也易於應會，這對於我是有莫大裨益的。她知道勤儉是一種美德，而不是寒酸的表現，應付人情蹙她應盡的責任，而不該存有羞澀畏懼之心，治理家事井井有條，敎育兒女諄諄善誘，像這樣的妻子，還不能够創造出一個快樂美滿甜蜜幸福的家庭嗎？</p>
<p>我在茫茫人海中尋找這樣的終身伴侶，希望能有實現的一天</p>

<h3>罐頭食物</h3>
<p>— 顧同高</p>
<p>——留在已開的罐頭中會壞嗎——</p>
<p>許多人以為食物留在已開的罐頭中，很快就會得得到毒性。但因為某種無法解釋的理由，這個觀念並不適用於罐頭牛奶；我們向來有一種習慣，把牛奶罐頭開一個孔後，一直用到罐頭內空空如也為止。</p>
<p>然而，如果是牛奶以外的別種食品，留在已開的罐頭內，普通都認為會發生毒質的，因此常常把食物遷到另一個容器中，可是後者往往和原來的罐頭是同樣的金屬製品，且未經消毒，却毫無疑義地應用了。</p>
<p>的確，有幾種食品是應該出淸到另一個容器中去的，但也並非因為有損害健康的危險。某幾種顏色很深的水果，如果放在原來的錫罐頭裏面，就會褪色。還有，某幾種酸性的食品如果遇到氧氣的話，會發生一種腐蝕的作用，幾天以後它們就腐蝕那容器，而那食物就會發生一種澀味，因為吸收了少量鐵質。</p>
<p>事實是，罐頭究竟是大多數罐頭食品未開動時最好的容器。如果沒有帝的理由，至少罐頭是消毒過的。一只盆子或盤子很可能帶有細菌，而那食物對於它們，可以說是最好的生長環境了。</p>
<p>不管怎樣，最最重要的一點是，隨便什麼已開動的罐頭食品，都應當視為容易變壞的東西。容器的性質倒還不過是個决要的問題。（譯自十月份雜誌文摘）</p>
<h3>有選擇性的聽覺</h3>
<p>— 乘之譯自雜誌文摘</p>
<p>我知道有一位夫人，她住在一個城市的熱鬧區中，有一個炎熱的晚上，她覺得很疲倦，所以很早就入睡了，電話鈴聲，不能驚醒她的甜夢，附近救火車往返及鄰室熟烈的無綫電跳舞節目，她都無動於中，濃睡不醒。她的妹妹更帶來一輩同學，他們開冰箱，玩樂器，鬧得不亦樂乎，也吵不醒她。可是奇蹟發生了，那時她對面一後房中發出一種很輕微的聲音；呌着：「媽媽！」她立刻如子彈從槍中射出一樣地從牀上跳起，衝到她的三歲小孩牀邊。</p>
<h3>美化家庭</h3>
<p>— 麥繼賢</p>
<p>應求顏色的配合</p>
<p>佈置現代美觀的家庭，應該先從顏色上着手，顏色是一種最能吸引人的東西。它可以使你感覺到幽靜，淸凉，或者是鮮艷溫暖，所以室內顏色的配合，無形中是調劑家庭空氣的一種要素。顏色的配合並不是一件困難的事，祗要明白機條原理，你對於它就會發生興趣，近來木器公司不時地改革傢具的式樣，而且更注重顏色上的配合，地毯，牆紙，窗簾等公司，都積極的向圖案美觀，顏色配合的路上邁進。</p>
<p>顏色有深有淺，各有其利弊，其中最重要的問題是必須配合在不相犯不礙限的原則之下。如果以大紅或鮮綠的顏色配合於室內，無論如何，你將感覺到刺眼，倘使於大紅中，放同樣分量的白顏色來混合一起，則變成了悅目的粉紅顏色了。至於淡薄的顏色，不十分容易顯著，於是要用它種顏色來反映它的光芒，如淡藍色獨自不覺得嬌豔，倘使放在淡奶黃色旁邊，它就相映益彰。無論如何，顏色在不相犯不礙眼的原則下賓主均勻，自然美觀。</p>
<p>顏色無論怎樣調和，怎樣美術化，唯一條件，必需適合時令，像上而所設的淺藍色和奶黃色，是最適合用於臥室的顏色，在春夏秋三季內都很適合，但是在冬天，你就嫌它帶着凉意；反過來說，在夏天臥室裏掛着鮮紅的窗帘，你會感覺到熟氣襲人。又如在冬天穿上一件淺顏色的罩袍，雖然自己很溫暖，可是別人見了都會寒慄起來，從這一點，我們可以看出氣候和顏色有莫大的連帶關係，而結論是天暖宜用淺色，天寒應採深色。在這酷寒的天氣中，假使室內仍掛着淺色的窗帘，你最好把它除去，換上深色——如深藍大紅——的窗帘，我相信你會感覺到室內充滿暖氣的。至於傢具，可分中西兩個式樣，顏色必須配合得妥當，如紅木的傢具，　配以大紅緞子的椅墊桌圍，方能顯出它古色古香的尊貴；倘使用大紅緞子套在沙發上，簡直是礙眼面又不雅觀了。反過來說，白色的布墊放在紅木傢具上，那就覺得有死喪之氣。同樣白色的布，蓋在西式的傢具上，我們感覺到它是聲潔，大方了。總之，顏色的配合，必須依着氣候，地點，式樣而決定，假使弄錯了上述三者任何一方面的話，雖然花了錢，也得不到舒適合意的結果，反而妨礙了家庭和洽的空氣呢。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>徵求讀者批評的回聲</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>本刋本月一日刋登啓事，徵求讀者讀者批評，先後收到讀者來信凡八百四十餘件；原定月中發表，嗣因整理費時，復以篇幅有限，爰依收到先後選登九件如次。並附「編者的話」以代答復。</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>即使貴報沒有徵求批評的話，我也想對於「春秋」作一點貢獻了。因爲貴報在上海是讀書層中比較可以讀的報，而「春秋」更的確是文藝副刋中在那裏隨時改進，很有些有保存價値的作品。</p>
<p>本於「春秋責備賢者」之意，我想先舉出幾點缺憾：（一）在一版之中似乎性質相同的佔得太多，而在連日之內也似乎興趣之調換微有不足。（二）「春秋」應該無所不談，但似乎談中國的太少了，談外國而兼談中國者更少。（三）你們注重散文是不錯的，但是散文尤其須注重有內容。我想如能綜合中國筆記軼事的內容，而以輕快之筆調寫出，是很適宜於副刋的。</p>
<p>基於上述的理由，我建議你們應該有幾個適宜的常川寫稿者分出兩三種文字每日或隔日登出，而以其餘地位容納特殊有價値的臨時來稿，你們不宜遷就手邊所有的稿件來定編輯方針，而應針對各種讀者的希望來供洽稿件，這才是進一步的理想的副刋。爲實現這個理想，如能再擴充一點篇幅，就更好了。據我看「春秋」很有成爲全國日報標準副刋的希望。是値得這樣做的。</p>
<p>再重言以申明之，我們讀者所感的不快，就是剛剛看見一篇有味的文字，下次再想看，又沒有了。讀者的興趣固然不同，但是都願意看有內容的，如果人人意中所有的話，一定不會歡喜，這是一定的。所以以此爲標準，來選擇文章，一定可以符合多數讀者和希望。</p>
<p>這兩個月內，洪爲法先生的「揚州續夢」，眞可愛極了，將來如單行，定爲不朽之作。又署各習喜的隨筆，文筆與內容都極名貴，可以成爲系統。像這些都似乎，應該，輪流常登。</p>

<p>「春秋」是申報的文藝副刋，擁有多量的讀者，其篇幅確爲寳貴，編者虛心徵求讀者批評其蘄求革新之熱忱，尤使人敬佩，不揣孤陋，貢我一言：</p>
<p>文藝原是現實政治，經濟，社會，谷方面生活的反映，而文藝的發揮，應該針對現實生活的缺陷着手，庶有裨補於時代人生，自來大詩人大文豪的傑作，均爲時代的產物，如詩人杜子美所寫離亂詩篇，讀了就可以知道當年「安」，「史」，之亂的流離狀况，白樂天「秦中吟」十首，就可相見唐代貞和貞元間權豪貴官之貪凟黑暗，「登樂游園」及「宿紫閣村」二章，寫當時執政權握軍符之輩的專橫暴戾，畢露無遺，讀其詩如歷其境，再如「文起八代之衰，道濟天下之溺」的韓文公，「原道」之作，完全是排斥佛老，痛論僧道坐食的弊害，亦是時代的針砭，所以文章的角度，是反映時代，文章的使命，是督導時代，現實即是文章，文章離不了現實，至於風月淸淡，尋章稽古，固亦有其價値，可是放眼乾坤，盱衡現狀，遭逢着如火如荼的時代，看到了洶湧澎湃的潮流，逸致閒情的作品，似不若督導時代文章來得需要。</p>
<p>貴刋三月來在選稿編排，形式內容，處處均表現着勤求改進，讀者自多滿意，惟對於選稿「現實性」一點，更希望加予注意</p>

<p>我個人是本刋的讀者，同時也要要筆桿寫寫稿子。三句不離本行，所寫文字，大都關於藝術方面的小品，（限於字數，不敢大寫）。如果讀者（指圈子以外的人）不感覺頭痛的話，我想向編者建議在每週星期六，來一次藝術的介紹和批評。（並非替作家捧塲）前幾天我已經和華林，劍華翀鵬諸兄談過要建立一個客觀的公正的藝術批評，說一些應該說的話。</p>

<p>四</p>
<p>在無論那一份報中，副刋都佔着很重要的地位，因爲副刋五方面可以調劑讀者的口味，另一方面亦是大衆的園地，使讀者有寫作發表的機會，所以我可肯定的說：報紙的興衰和銷路的增减與副刋有着密切關係。</p>
<p>我們無可諱言的，申報的副刋（其實週刋亦是副刋）是最多，而且亦此較能適合我們讀者的理想。</p>
<p>「春秋」是一個純文藝的副刋，在質的方面，因爲由於錄取的水準很高，所以給與讀者的印象是美滿的。至於在量的方面，我認爲由於長篇的稿子太多，連載太長，一次僅能登載了三四篇，减少了讀者的興趣，因爲過長的稿子，是不宜於登載在副刋裏的，如果多登了短小精悍而又富有興趣的散文和小品文，長篇小說亦最好一兩月結束一篇，不但鼓勵發者寫作的興趣，那麼，我就有一個建議，就是希望「春秋」能每月舉行一次「文藝　文」，選其優良的前六名發表　這樣，更能引起讀者的興趣。這是其二。</p>
<p>我是「春秋」的一個忠實讀者，爲了愛護「春秋」，所所就冒昧的投上了這篇「批評兼建議」信，不過我所提的僅是原則而已。</p>

<p>五</p>
<p>貴刋是我在各報中栽愛好的副刋。以前每天仔細地讀，最近一月來，更每天剪下保留着，現在巳漸漸積成一厚疊，閒來常常翻閱，深覺意味無窮。</p>
<p>昨天見載有閣下徵求讀者對貴刊的批評，所以現在就將我對於貴刋的一些愚見貢獻給閣下，諒愚者千慮或有一得，亦未可知。</p>
<p>把所剪留的二三十份貴刋翻閱了一遍，「揚州續夢」，「歐陽修與朱淑貞之（生查子）案」，「富春江上，」「裴麗斯魏蘭傳，」「蠶事備忘錄」，「秦淮月」，「我所認識的張大千，」可引起了讀者的興趣，而且亦能增多讀者發表文稿的機會，直接鼓勵了作者的勇氣，簡接助長了報紙的銷路。這是其一。</p>
<p>副刋旣是大衆的園地，又是「小巧玲瓏記蘇州」等數篇是我所喜讀的，他細分析一下，可分別列入黨故，遊記，傳記，雜感，處世修養等類，言中無物，長噓短嘆的文字，是我所憎厭的，希望貴刋對於以上所說的幾類，猶其是足以增加讀者的知識，改進讀者的品格等建設性的文字，予以多多登載。</p>

<p>（自鎭江寄）</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>貴刊一向取材均很愼重的，編排也是相當藝術本沒有什麼諮議的地方。但是先生旣如此虛　若　的徵求讀者意見，續將貴刊「精益求精，」本人站在讀者的立塲上，謹略述數如下：</p>
<p>一，選稿方面，要側重文學：多多徵求幽默雋水的小品文字（或抒情的散文詩章），及關於簡短的內容充實的學術文藝，小稅除「一寸山河一寸血」仍繼續刋出外，他如不合現實的及內容欠佳的普通長什，預好能少登出，免致徒佔幅。</p>
<p>二，形式方面要盡量求其藝術，每日篇幅的大小，頂好能有一定的標準，如貴刋現在大多是佔一版的二分之一但是有時不免有擴大或者縮小，似乎需要改善。</p>
<p>三，關於插貿，望多選名人的精作，如上月的「浮烟遠岫圖」，「浙東山水，」「蘭」……等幅，滿含着一種詩意的風味，令人看之趣味橫生。</p>
<p>以上三點，是本人對貴刋的意見，也是讀者對貴刋的一點希望。特提供參考。</p>
<p>— 王少民</p>
<p>（合肥安徽省政府秘書處）</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>無論是大報的編輯，或小報的編輯，都應該有一份「虛心」接受廣大讀者的批評的「誠意」，像進珊先生主編本報「春秋」，他就有這麼一條心，是値得欽佩的。</p>
<p>讓我說得遠一點，在聖戰以前，本報副刊的「自由談」編者黎烈文先生，他取稿的態度的愼重與嚴正，跟現在的進珊先生主編「春秋」大同小異，在純文藝的　地裏不參入一點別的色彩的東西，這是現在「春秋」的「優點」，使廣大的讀者引起歡迎的共鳴。</p>
<p>現在我以一個愛護本刋的讀者的地位，對「暮秋」一點供獻，然而亦祇是一點點淺見。</p>
<p>一·過云的「春秋」，在編排的形式上，與內容「質」的份量上，是相當充實了，不過，我覺得得所刊載的文章。多半個重於「都市」性，很少看到拿各階層民衆動態與廣大農民羣爲題材的文章；所以給予讀者嗅覺上除了「華貴」之外，勞動者羣底撲實粗衆與朗爽的氣味，很不容易嗅得到一點。希望本刊今後應多登一點與民生有關，或刻劃各階層民衆動態的文章。</p>
<p>二·在「春秋」上，希望今後多多讀到一批新進作者的文章，不要盡讓幾位老作家操心，一方面應盡量提掖「新進」者，而使「春秋」成爲眞正的大衆園地。</p>
<p>三·希望今後除刊登中篇速載外，多載短篇小說，而將小說內之精彩處配以「木刻」襯托，更會使廣大讀者歡迎。</p>
<p>— 章鐵珠</p>
<p>（德淸縣縣立圖書館）</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>我是貴刊的忠實讀者，每當送報者送來申報的時候，我總是最先的檢出「春秋」來細細的默讀，其次再閱其他的新聞。這裏我將我所熟習的幾位貴刊讀者，相同的感覺，錄奉先生，想先生不致怪我冒昧吧！</p>
<p>關於愛讀的多數偏向於短篇的文藝創作，差不多大多數的讀者均有同感，其次爲散文，短詩，……對於人物介紹，書評，藝術評論及介紹興趣不大濃厚，原因據他們解釋說：人物以及作品的好壞是有目共睹的，決不致因評論的偏見而增减其地位和價値。至若長篇太長，亦常因間斷，不能繼續閱讀。</p>
<p>於選稿方面，亦希望多選合乎大多數讀者所喜愛的爲最好。</p>
<p>關於編排，最好將每日的春秋規劃出適當篇幅，例如創作方面佔幾分之幾，散文，詩，……等應佔篇幅的幾分之幾，人物介紹，藝術，批評並不是不歡迎，最好以一星期的某一日闢作專載，來詳確的介紹評論一下，俾得使讀者也可以專心研讀。</p>
<p>以上拉雜的寫下幾點，絕對是以善意的熱忱，根據較多人的希望寫成，想先生不致怪我「不知輕重」吧？</p>

<p>編者先生計劃本刊的改進，徵求讀者批評。在下是讀者一份于，正好藉此發表一點惑想。不過當然談不到「批評！」</p>
<p>（一）空泛和長篇的非必要的論文，最好不載，或减少。</p>
<p>（二）多載短小精悍報導性之短　創作。</p>
<p>（三）多載學術性，有研究價値的短篇論文。</p>
<p>（四）多載有相當內容的散文。</p>
<p>（五）多載文藝價値的新詩。上面幾項芻見，對於新詩，似乎還得重複地聲明一下；在這靜寂的詩壇上，正好　起前進的火炬，使它欣欣向榮，不知編者先生的意想以爲怎樣？</p>

<h3>歲尾章</h3>
<p>— 方還</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>我背上憂鬱的行囊，這行囊先前我是用莫大的代價換來的。－慈母的和煦，家園的溫馨，以及少年輕盈的戀情……幾年來，浪跡天涯，經不起北國的砂浪和風塵的侵襲，我的行囊有些破殘了。偶或低頭，才發覺我的鞋頭破了，衫褲也顯得寒傖，風雨過處，我的心上又多了一層創傷的烙印。還年靑呢，我警惕着自己，爲什麼竟這樣的哀傷呢！幾度顚仆在世道險阻的陷阱裏，倒了又起，把視綫投向遠處，前面是更多的荆棘，更大的坎坷。</p>
<p>人生的旅途旁，行程匆促的客店裏，在雨打芭蕉的豆油燈下，細數着慈母的針綫，臨行密密縫，添土一夜絮絮的叮　，歸期何日？遊子的心快碎了。我那曾爲她老人家用愛憐的目光輕撫過的頭髮呀，如今風雨的班痕代替了慈母的指印，無情的歲月剝奪了我這一些僅有的溫暖，把寂寞的心底留下一片空白。</p>
<p>人間好寒冷呀！</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>兒時，在故鄕，也是這樣的殘秋天氣，然而給於我的感覺却並不如此料峭而寂寞。</p>
<p>生長在山城裏的孩子，不知道暮秋的水　有怎樣的顏色，那蘆好翻白的江邊又該是何種情調。我只知道一到秋天，那些灼手可然的楓林便像無數年靑的火炬，燒遍了整個山腰，站在西山的紅楓下，看棉絮似的白雲一簇簇從山的背後擁來，又悠悠地行向另一個山頭。秋風勁厲，傍山人家的竹籬邊却依舊有一對釋眞的羔羊在抵着角，嘻戲着。</p>
<p>「怕冷嗎？」</p>
<p>「不。」</p>
<p>「那末上山去！」　在山上我們更燃起一團　火，大堆的敗草殘葉一邊在燒，一邊在發出劈拍的聲響。風正緊，火勢也就更旺了。頓時間便覺有無比的溫暖，我們卸下了身上的外衣，我們的靈魂在跳躍，我們的血液在沸騰。隔着那赤炎炎的火舌，隱的可以看見對面同伴的小顆被灼熱得像蘋果般通紅，於是我們相視而笑了，笑聲隨着歡歌，撒落在山的每一個角落。在熊熊的火光中，童年的情感被溶和在一起，孩子們聖潔的心靈被洗鍊得更純潔了。</p>
<p>我們遂翩然以小普洛米修士自居。——那偉大的取火者，不惜以西克座荒禁的苦難，爲人類偸來了星星火種。</p>
<p>也接受了倔强的火花的啓示，我們憧憬着明日的掙扎將是何等苦難，明日的戰鬥將是何等艱辛。</p>
<p>但是——</p>
<p>「有了火，我們就不怕黑暗啦！」</p>
<p>「有了火，我們就不怕寒冷啦！」</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>由於生命的火把的召喚，我的理智茁壯了。這些年來，我苦苦搜索着眞理，像回敎徒朝拜聖地時一樣的迫切和虔誠。</p>
<p>又譬若一隻世故的氣候烏，對於風雲的變幻我是具有高度的敏感的。我忍受不住每一刻使人窒息的空氣，我惶惑着天際的每一朶烏雲，似乎道些都是雷雨前夕的朕兆。我幾乎不敢相信冬日偽善的和暖，因爲緊接在它後面的往往是一塲更加寒凜，更加劇烈的大雪。……像猿啼，也像鬼號，遠處的松林中發出了朔風的呼嘯，山雨欲來，氣壓多深沉呵！</p>
<p>我在無邊的黑晴中摸索着道路，在漫長的無星月之夜，我企求着一綫希望的曙光。不想當我正在歌頌光明之時，光明却稍蹤即逝，黎明之後，依舊是白茫茫的霧，無窮黑暗的昏沉和迷惘。</p>
<p>我過着一速串陰霾苦澀的日子。</p>
<p>我夢見那些黃日的陷阱在漫無止境的擴大，擴大。</p>
<p>在窗前，我發現了第一根靑春的白髮。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>我懂得了憎恨。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>然而現在是冬天了。江南的原野只賸有陰沉，荒凉，寥寂，和落寞，掩飾不了困　和勞頓古老的田地現出了烈的皺紋，也隱飾不了一年操作的辛勞，老牛在低窪的牛欄裏發出滄桑的嘆息。陌隴間，岸上，盡是些散亂的草葉和柴屑，枯藤，老樹，昏鴉……我在緬想着故鄉的　水可會枯竭，煊爛的楓林有沒有褪了血紅的顏色。</p>
<p>野草潛藏着生機，潛藏着活力，在銀皚的雪地裏等待着來春的抽芽，時代的歌手也沉默了，經過了一度嚴冬的蟄息以後，預備在明年的春天再來一次生命熱烈的蛙鼓。</p>
<p>那末何不沉默呢？在沉默中學習，在沉默中記取，假使說人們的心底並沒有沉默，那末潛伏在沉默之後的何嘗不是有着更大的力量。</p>
<p>「沉默呵！不在沉默中爆發，就在沉默中滅亡！」</p>

<h3>慢性饑餓</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>市政府交響樂團為了請求發給十二月份薪水未遂，於耶誕節之夜，由全體四十三們團員致函市長，其中有金句日：</p>
<p>「我們相信沒有再比看着自己同伴因「慢性饑餓」而逐漸死亡的事再可悲了，尤其是，為了我們的文化貢獻，下面一羣簽着名字的犧牲者的生存，並不是沒有價值的。」</p>
<p>「我們除了應得的一份之外，不預備再向你要求其它的利益。只要你說一個字，把薪水發下來，便可把許多有急需的樂師們的緊肚皮放鬆一點。親愛的市長，你肯不肯發發這一點點慈悲心呢？」</p>
<p>在各業大　年賞花紅的此時此地，居然還有要求准時發薪這支意外的插曲，人間何世？傎是不勝矛盾之至！</p>
<p>市政府交響樂團即以前之工部局交響樂團，梅百器先生勞瘁一生，建立了它的傳統的光輝歷史，它可以稱為上海的驕傲這一，國內外音樂界都一致推崇，然而在藝術上有成就，並不足以就保證不「緊肚皮」而「慢性饑餓」的。這類的故事太多了，特別是在音樂界方面。</p>
<p>有人告訴我，在飯店酒樓裏吹打的，每月有近百萬元的收入，而且飯店酒樓還供給兩頓點心，一頓夜飯，我很想勸勸交響樂團的朋友們，何必發傻勁，講什麼藝術，誰又要你們對文化貢獻呀！乾脆地先弄飽肚子再說，飯店酒樓舞塲，至少不致於受到慢性饑餓的痛苦呀，是不是呢？</p>

<p>「就這樣就好了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，」她微笑着說，「因為我的丈夫名字呌皮爾。」（譯自十二月份皇冠雜誌」</p>

<p>卅五年，這三百六十五頁中，頁頁都是「第」與「亂」，因窮而亂，愈亂愈窮，互為因果，不知將伊於有底？</p>
<p>勝利對於咱們，正如「九九」還歸八十一，依舊沒有勝利。愧逢除夕，總覺得萬事皆非，一無是處，但是「生存」與「失望」，倆個並立，儘管是窮途末路，也得盡盡人力，即便是一個「宿命論」者，也還會：「盡人力，聽天命！」決沒有「由它去」的道理！何況「路轉　回」，「柳暗花明」？只有懦怯者和懶惰者是怕見希望」的！親愛的朋友們：今宵送走窮與亂，卅六年是「希望」年！</p>
<h3>除夕大掃除</h3>
<p>— 圣潔</p>
<p>三十五年已盡頭，一年容易又除夕，商店裹忙着結賬，機關裹趕到造報銷。是的，結束了一年，必須總清算一下，然後可以安心的過新年。我想到往常的習慣，每屆歲末，任何塲所，都要大掃除，一般人往往忽略了大掃除的意義，以為祗是打掃清潔與掃盡灰塵而已；其實，掃除，既加上了「大」字，那就該「無微不至，無孔不入。」</p>
<p>我很慚愧名義上是公務員，吃公家的飯，拿國家的薪給，但事實上，我並沒有盡到自己的責任，上班早退遲到，辦公時高興畫兩筆「等因奉此」，不高興則看看小報，反正我有後台老關，天不怕，地不怕，抱定一個原則，不管到不到，簽到簿上總是有我大名。因此這一年我是鬼混過去。又逢除夕，捫心自問，不勝感愧！因而，坦白自供，趁此大掃除，「鬼混」應成過去，「苦幹」且自今日始！</p>
<h3>亂世窮年話鑽石</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>燦爛奪目的鑽石，使多少人瘋狂？多少人失身？多少人犯法？鑽石的價格恐怕僅次於原子彈吧？目前每克拉的市價，平均約九百八十五元美金，還得外加一筆重稅。但是，拆穿了講，一顆鑽石還不是和煤塊一樣的是一小顆碳素。不過一個成了結晶體，一個未結晶罷了。但是為什麼鑽石的價格如此的高呢？這是有許多理由的：有些為了珍奇，有些為了幻想，還有一個如同通貨管理一般的人為的原因。</p>
<p>在世界最大的和採用最科學的方法的南非的金包萊礦塲（Kinaberley　Mines），為了檢取一顆半克拉的鑽石，從地面下三千六百呎的地方將岩石（或稱「藍地」）掘起來，傾倒在箱子內，令工人們分頭去「淘鑽」。　置的無鑽的岩石的重量，是覺得的鑽石的重量的三億二千萬倍。有許多「淘鑽」工人辛勞了三十年還未曾看見過一顆鑽石！</p>
<p>世界上最大的一顆鑽石，原重三千一百另六克拉（約一又三分之一磅），是南非州普利米爾礦塲（Premier　Mine）的地面管理員弗立特列克。威爾斯（Frederick　Wello）在一九〇五年發現的。這顆大鑽石命名為「柯林南」（Cullinan）以尊崇該公司總裁湯瑪斯，柯林南，後來護送到倫敦。該地的專家估計它值七千五百萬美金！威爾斯收到了一萬元美金的獎金。後來南非聯邦的全斯瓦爾政府（Transvaal）將它買了焉做為獻給英皇愛德華七世的禮物。在他六十六歲誕辰大典那天，奉獻上去。英找不到為了看它一看，便付了從英格蘭銀行提出二小時的保險費七百二十五元美金。</p>
<p>「柯林南」後來被一個呌阿司采（J·Asscher）的鑽匣分割成五塊。（其中一塊後來又分割成許多小塊）最大的四塊現在嵌最大的是「柯林南第一」，作梨形，重五百三十克拉，嵌在鑽冠的正中。</p>
<p>鑽石的美麗和可愛，並非單純得自它的天然的本質，有一部份也是靠人類的科學的技術。這種技術就是砌和磨，以增加鑽石的「面」，也就是增加它的耀目的光彩。今天的「標準的燦爛的鑽石」，有五十八個面，每一面都是用磨鑽輪砌成最正確的比例。一顆鑽石的光彩決定於從它的「面」中反射出來的光線的多寡，所以面愈多的鑽石就愈燦爛。</p>
<p>鑽石並非僅用以裝飾，它在工業中確有用途的——它可以轉動機器的各部分，製造碾磨輪，將金屬製成精細的金屬線。關於後者，傎是一種驚人的奇技。三四百頓的銅經過排列着鑽石的粉末的極微細的小孔後，形成的銅絲，足夠繞地球二十圈。</p>
<p>鑽石所以能夠應用於工業界，因為它是世界上最堅硬的物質，不易磨損，也不受熱的影響，工程師在鑽堅硬的東西時，都用鑽石做鑽頭。醫生磨牙齒的鑽頭，也有用鑽石做的。但是，很奇怪，工業用的鑽石却便宜得很，每克拉不過四元到十二元美金。這是什麼原故呢？單簡得很，因為它們是人類的——科學家用碳造的。這種人造鑽石無論光彩與硬度，都比不上傎的鑽石。</p>
<p>最後，談談供鑽石維持高價的人為的原因：世界上最大的鑽石產地是非洲和印度，前者位於英國和比利時的殖民地內，後者單純是英國的殖民地，英比兩國佔據的鑽石礦塲佔世界的百分之九十五。所以他們聯合起全組織一個壟斷操縱的集團，隨他們的心意定價錢，並且維持它。他們一方面賺錢，另一方面也保護購買者不受市塲波動的損失。——假如他們不如此，供給與需要，一定改觀，鑽石的價格也要大跌。</p>
<p>在世俗的狂愛下，抬高了鑽石的身價，也裝滿了一部份人的錢　。</p>
<h3>自食其果</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>這幾天的倒風，傎有些嚇人！大家都推在「高利貸」的身上，都說是受了高利貸的罪惡，於是逼倒了這許多商號，但是在下却要替高利貸「呼冤」！</p>
<p>有好多商號的倒閉，實也由於「貪得無厭」！像黃金在高漲的時候，銀行金號大家拼命地吸進，萬不料一記耳光，跌風一起，就此　累倒閉，而偏偏推說是受了「高利貸」的禍，傎是替高利貸呼冤哉也！</p>
<p>傎正受到「高利貸」的罪惡，倒是一般普通商店！用為中國社會有名俗語：「傎商無傎本」，做商意的全靠向外拉款子，所以講到受「高利貸」的影響，却是一般普通的商店！</p>
<p>同時高利貸的造成，實為給一般「投機」「囤積」家等所始作俑者，他們想「爭取暴利」，於是把利息「烘高」了！最近許多家銀號等倒閉，多為了「貪得無厭」於前，而「自食其果」於後！</p>
<p>所以「倒風」的這樣可怕，又豈僅是「高利貸的罪惡」？太上日「禍福無門，惟人自召」！一些都不差呢！</p>
<h3>婆婆媳婦</h3>
<p>— 李𢽾</p>
<p>「自由談」前次「�期雜談」會談及婆媳之間的問題，名言儻論，都已拜讀，茲擬不揣　陋，代為結論如下，適逢送舊迎新，願以此祝福各位家庭快樂！</p>
<p>一（婆）：不癡不聲，豈非阿家翁？不聞不問樂得享清福。</p>
<p>二（媳）：婆婆總是長輩，理應恭敬孝順，丈夫還是妳的，何忍讓他氣受？</p>
<p>三（子）：不偏不僻，有妻更當有母，互容互諒，任勞再須任怨。</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織22</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>要錢總歸難　求乞也不易</p>
<p>在中國，乞丐是一種古老的職業。在下級社會中，乞丐是比賣淫業發揚得更早的，俗語道：「為丐三年，官也不願做了。」雖說得夸張過份，但個中奧妙，乃在「為丐三年」這四個字上面。士大夫單一向不把乞丐放在眼裹，以為他們都是不中用的傢伙，其實並不盡然。在先前，為丐都須　師入幫忙。入幫是抽象的，但「拜師」却是不能敷衍了事的。為丐須接受各種基本訓練，至少三年之久，然後方算藝成應世，那時願意官與否，自然也聽便了。</p>
<p>拜師傳授衣缽，未必是由「丐頭」親自傳授。丐頭有如校長，其手下自有敎員之流敎授專門科目。例如拳術便有拳師，配藥療傷便有江湖郎中及採藥師，唱歌度曲便有音樂師等。居然門類繁多，必修科選修科各門俱備。學生丐兒須年納例金若干，儘可傳授。　本調經營活動的綱目如下：</p>
<p>（甲）「學習　　技能」——最普通的如「頂鼻」，「穿舌」，「舞刀」，「舞花碗」，「擲球」，「彈折」等。凡屬肢體健全無任何疾患的丐流，唯有苦心習好一二種技藝，比較上街哀求，或是亂呌狂喊的較易得錢。乞丐所　帶的用具，都各有其用法，不得隨意支配致犯「幫規」。例如磁碗竹籃用以乞錢，飯袋鐵鍋用以裝菜，攜拐杖以逐狗防身，突破襖以存錢結樓。此外的用具如三弦，胡琴，板，鼓，劍戟，刀粑，大架，鼠環，猴帽，羊衣，都須視所學的技能練習應用。</p>
<p>（乙）「對施主的稱呼」——乞丐上街呌化，對施主的稱呼類別甚多，須視人而施，一切均恃鑑別力與經騐。例如（一）「少爺」，（二）「大爺」，（三）「大老爺」，（四）「老太爺」，這四種稱呼，便是對付有身份的老倌階級，其分別有年齡和身份的等差。對女性的例如：（五）「太太」，（六）「老太太」，（七）「太奶奶」，（八）「少奶奶」，（九）「小姐」等。如有差錯，如稱未婚少女為「少奶」「太太」，便要挨罵而不得錢。故對青春女子，總以稱「小姐」比較免干罪淚。還有（十）「相公」，（十）（一）「　公　」，（十）（二）「大叔」，（十）（三）「嬸子」，（十）（四）「財主」，（十）（五）「財主媽」等，都是成雙成對，要看準對方是一對夫妻，而且恰合對建身份的，方可脫口而出。此外還有，（十六）「一官」，（十七）「老板」，（十八）「掌柜的」，（十九）「大姑兒」，（二十）「老總」，（廿十一）「先生」，也都各有分寸，而且一見面都得呌出，不得三思而後言。這種能力都須閱歷經騐均當。</p>
<p>（丙）「呌哭的訓練」——丐流上街呌化，無論是行乞或坐乞，都要會哭泣。這與戲劇演員一樣，須受訓練，否則事實上並不「悲從中來」，那末哭泣的情感呢？男丐欲哭無淚，原是活該，但也非強哭不可。女丐比較易哭，但必須有韻有調，哀感動人，方算上乘，有經騐的天才女丐，對此道都有把握，她們時當團坐路旁，號淘大哭，聲聲帶淚，句句動人，或則沿街哀號，幼子相隨，但得錢時立即停哭稱謝。煞車之快，令人驚佩！男丐號哭，比較缺少藝術成份，不得不同時表演殘疾以乞人憐。</p>

<h3>Political Review Meeting; Departments Provide Detailed Reports</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Song Ziwen and others held a tea reception for National Assembly representatives of the Kuomintang at the Ministry of National Defense Guest House at 4:00 PM on the 30th, to report on administrative measures and review political work. Over 700 people attended. During the reception, Song delivered a brief report on past political work and invited suggestions for improvement. Many attendees spoke, addressing issues such as: (1) commodity prices, (2) employment, (3) civil servant compensation, (4) the handling of enemy and puppet assets, (5) transportation, (6) finance, and (7) corruption. Speakers offered candid criticisms of past measures, often in passionate terms. Yu Hongjun, Wang Shijie, Yu Dawei, and others successively provided detailed reports on finance, foreign affairs, and transportation. Finally, Song Ziwen provided a comprehensive report, explaining the current difficulties in governance, and promised to provide written responses. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun reported on financial matters at the political review meeting. Yu emphasized that efforts would be made to rectify the conduct of tax officials, establish a rational tax system, strictly prohibit smuggling, rigorously manage commercial banks, and channel idle capital into industry. Transportation Minister Yu Dawei reported on the progress of railway repair throughout the country, as well as the current status of postal and telecommunications services. Finally, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs, stating that the international situation would inevitably become clearer in the future, due to two fundamental reasons: (1) no country in the world desires another war; and (2) most of the problems among the United Nations have been resolved. China's future foreign policy will consist of three points: (1) to strive to strengthen the United Nations organization, enhance its authority, and ensure its permanent existence, thereby permanently safeguarding world peace; (2) to strictly adhere to the Sino-Soviet Treaty; and (3) to protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Temporary Meeting of the Political Consultative Council Standing Committee; Discussion of Draft General Budget; Meeting Continues This Morning for Deliberation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The temporary meeting of the Political Consultative Council Standing Committee was held at 9:00 AM on the 30th on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. Twenty-seven councilors attended, including Kong Geng, Wu Yifang, Chen Qitian, Luo Heng, Fu Sinian, and Su Ting. Mo Dehui chaired the meeting. The Secretariat first reported on the letter from the Secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council forwarding the draft general budget of the Central Government for the 36th year, requesting deliberation.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan Attends and Reports on National Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>The draft was then discussed. Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Xu Kan reported on the compilation and auditing method of the national budget for the 36th year, and reported on the national policy guidelines to be implemented in conjunction with the appropriations for the 36th year: (1) to initiate constitutional government, promote democratic politics, and establish people's representative bodies at all levels; (2) to strengthen local self-government, restore local order, and enable the people to live and work in peace; (3) to increase tax revenue and reduce unnecessary expenditures, so that finance will gradually return to normal; (4) to restore transportation, enhance transport capacity, and subsidize industrial and commercial development to increase production; (5) to implement farmland improvement, increase agricultural production, regulate agricultural finance, and strive to improve the lives of farmers; (6) to quickly restore schools at all levels to their original state and provide schooling opportunities for out-of-school youth; and (7) to reorganize the national army in accordance with the army reorganization and unification plan, to achieve the nationalization of the army.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Yu Hongjun Answers Inquiries from Councilors</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Yu Hongjun then supplemented the explanation, and various councilors raised questions and opinions, which Yu answered on the spot. In summary: regarding methods to increase production, the government has paid attention to agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and the budget already includes over 153 billion for construction expenses. Because the Assets Committee is now independent, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' jurisdiction is limited to economic administration, and the Assets Committee's budget is over 230 billion. Regarding the apparently low budget for education and culture, a comparison with the 35th year will reveal a significant percentage increase, as the 35th year was only over 40 billion, while the 36th year is over 340 billion. The clearing of industries in the Northeast and how to handle Northeast circulating notes are under careful consideration and should not pose major problems.</p>
<h3>Special Committee Formed to Investigate Shanghai Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Five temporary motions were then passed. Three of them concerned the request that the government thoroughly investigate the Shanghai plane crash. The following three measures were decided upon: (1) the Standing Committee will organize a special committee to go to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the accident; (2) the government is requested to promptly punish the persons in charge of the China and Central airlines; and (3) the two companies are instructed to promptly compensate the families of the deceased and the injured.</p>
<h3>Take Effective Steps to Protect Overseas Chinese in Vietnam</h3>
<p>The other two motions were proposed by Councilor Luo Heng: (1) the government is requested to promptly protest to the Vietnamese government and take effective steps to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Vietnam; and (2) the government is requested to promptly devise concrete measures and instruct the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to promptly assist the refugees in Beijing, by issuing winter clothing, establishing dining halls and heating facilities, and cracking down on all illegal acts of embezzlement. It was resolved to send the motions to the government for earnest handling. The general budget proposal for the 36th year will continue to be deliberated at a meeting on the morning of the 31st. Minister Peng Denies Rumors Again</p>
<h3>Adjusting Foreign Exchange is Nonsense</h3>
<p>Minister Peng Denies Rumors Again</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department once again refuted rumors at a press conference on the 30th, dismissing reports of foreign exchange adjustments as nonsense spread by speculators. He emphasized that the current serious economic problem lies in the severe destruction in various regions and the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to the decline of industry and commerce and the bankruptcy of rural areas. Therefore, to get to the root of the problem and solve the current economic difficulties, relying solely on financial methods will not be sufficient.</p>
<h3>Total Expenditures for Next Year Exceed 930 Billion; Military Spending Accounts for Over 40 Percent</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 30th. Minister Peng gave a detailed explanation of the budget for the coming year, stating that the budget is currently under review by the Political Consultative Council. After the Political Consultative Council reviews it, the Supreme National Defense Council will make the final decision. According to the analysis of the draft, there are approximately the following key points: (1) total expenditures are approximately 933.2 billion; (2) military expenses are 388.1 billion, accounting for over 40 percent of total expenditures; (3) construction expenditures are approximately over 15 billion, of which transportation expenses are approximately over 109 billion, state-owned industrial expenses are approximately over 23 billion, and the remainder is for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and health; (4) education expenses are over 34 billion, more than four times higher than last year. Subsidies for overseas Chinese education, military education, and private schools are not included. Although they account for only 3 percent of total expenditures, the ratio is higher if various special expenditures are excluded; (5) rehabilitation and relief expenses are approximately 144 billion, of which the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration accounts for 16 billion; (6) subsidies for provinces and cities total 69 billion; (7) the second reserve fund is listed at over 4 billion, and retirement and pension expenses for civil servants are listed at 4.5 billion; (8) party expenses are not listed; (9) the total revenue is over 70 billion, more than three times higher than in the 35th year, of which tax revenue is over 36 billion, also more than three times higher. Revenue from the sale of materials and assets is over 2 billion, including enemy and puppet assets and surplus materials purchased by our government from the U.S. military. Revenue from the surplus of state-owned enterprises is approximately 9 billion, of which the Aviation Company contributes over 4 billion and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company contributes over 1.1 billion. The shortfall of over 22 billion will be made up by debt revenue. It is hoped that order and security in some northern provinces can be restored as soon as possible, and that transportation can be opened as soon as possible, so that financial deficits can be made up and the economy can be revived without difficulty. President Ju Presides and Encourages Comrades to Complete Constitutional Government</p>
<h3>Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>President Ju Presides and Encourages Comrades to Complete Constitutional Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Central Memorial Week was held this morning at the National Government, combined with the commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising. President Ju Youren presided, and Kuomintang representatives to the National Assembly were invited to attend. The President delivered a speech elucidating the significance and course of the Yunnan Uprising, and encouraged party comrades not to forget the sacrifices of the many martyrs of the past, and to continue to work hard with their spirit of revolutionary struggle. Ju continued: The work of constitutional drafting has now been successfully completed, but there is still much effort required to implement the Constitution. We must continue to eliminate various obstacles with even greater strength. In the past nine years, our party has successfully led the War of Resistance. In the future implementation of constitutional government, we must work hard to promote the completion of the revolutionary mission. The speech lasted fifteen minutes, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<h3>Fu Sinian to Go Abroad Next Spring</h3>
<p>Plans to Go to the United States for Medical Treatment Due to High Blood Pressure</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Fu Sinian plans to go to the United States for medical treatment for high blood pressure in early spring next year when the weather warms. Fu denied rumors that Hu Shi would become the Minister of Education in the reorganized government, believing that there was no such thing. Fu believed that the outrage taken by the student community over the rape of a Peking University female student by a U.S. soldier was a natural response, and that the U.S. military should be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Two Locations on the Banks of the Yalu River to be Withdrawn by Soviet Troops to Korean Territory Next Month; Temporary Agreement to be Made Before Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Regarding the Soviet Embassy's reply to our Foreign Ministry on the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed along the Yalu River, according to what our reporter has learned, there are over 20 Soviet troops stationed at the Lagu whistle dike over 100 li northeast of Andong City, and a unit of Soviet troops is stationed at the bridgehead of the Sea Line River, which is connected to Manho in Korea, over 20 li north of Ji'an. The Soviet side claimed that the Soviet troops in the Lagu whistle area were there to protect the Shuifeng Power Plant on the opposite bank and the safety of our dike, so a temporary agreement with us is required before the withdrawal. Our side will negotiate with the Third Pacification Zone, and Xu Kezhang, a staffer from the Shenyang Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, will be sent to inspect. It is said that after the two sides reach an agreement in Andong, the Soviet troops in the two locations will withdraw to Korean territory in early January.</p>
<h3>After Consultation and Decision by Various Parties, the Government Will Proceed with Reorganization; Minister Peng Talks at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Regarding the issue of government reorganization, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department answered reporters' questions at a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 30th, stating that the government has invited various parties attending the National Assembly to participate in the government. Now these parties have held separate meetings to discuss, and only after they have made a decision can the foundation for expanding the government's organization and reorganizing the two Yuan be discussed and carried out. As for whether the government is considering extending a formal invitation to the Communist Party and the Democratic League, if the Communist Party and the Democratic League show signs of willingness to participate in the work of reorganizing the government, the government will not hesitate to send an invitation immediately. Peng also stated that Zhou Enlai's remarks that he does not recognize the Constitution are a baseless disparagement, as the achievements of this National Assembly's constitutional drafting work and the democratic advantages of the Constitution's contents are obvious to all and widely praised throughout the world. The Communist Party's attitude has been poor recently, and there is absolutely no intention of cooperation. The government has not yet considered sending anyone to Yan'an.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party's Position on the Current Situation: Immediately Resume Peace Talks Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Democratic Socialist Party issued six points on its position on the current situation, excerpts of which are as follows:</p>
<p>First, the ceasefire order should be thoroughly implemented by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the Executive Group should participate.</p>
<p>Second, peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be resumed immediately. The government authorities should send personnel to Yan'an, or invite the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to Beijing, to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Third, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should resolve issues regarding local governments and troop stationing inside and outside the Great Wall with the greatest forbearance.</p>
<p>Fourth, in accordance with the military reorganization plan, the nationalization of the army should be earnestly implemented.</p>
<p>Fifth, after a foundation is obtained in the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, it should be expanded into a national party conference. Various powerful democratic groups should also be invited to participate, to discuss all political issues and lay the foundation for the rule of law.</p>
<p>Sixth, from now on, the government should immediately, in accordance with the Constitution passed by this National Assembly, earnestly protect the basic freedoms of the people's body, speech, association, and academic study. In other words, it should earnestly end the Kuomintang's one-party rule.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhong Changwei Wu Xianzai, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Li Daming, Feng Jinbai, Tang Zhuxin, Sun Baoyi, and others of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party held an important meeting at Zhang Zai's residence in Fan Yuan yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, chaired by Zhang Junmai.

<h3>Central Political Committee to be Established Soon; Standing Committee Passes Organizational Regulations for the Committee's Secretariat; Chairmen of Ji and Sui Provinces Already Appointed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The 48th meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held in the National Government Conference Room at 11:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, following the Central Memorial Week. Member Yu Youren chaired the meeting and passed the organizational regulations for the Secretariat of the Central Political Committee, etc. The Second Plenary Session had previously resolved to establish the Central Political Committee, which is subordinate to the Central Executive Committee. Its organizational regulations had been amended by the 30th meeting of the Central Standing Committee. It is reported that the committee will be formally established soon. The Central Standing Committee also passed the following cases today: (1) adjusting the pension for martyrs and party members; (2) Wang Renwei, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Executive Committee, was appointed as the speaker of the Hebei Provincial Provisional Assembly and resigned, which was approved, and Comrade Wang Bingjun was appointed to replace him; and (3) Zuo Yi, chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Executive Committee, was transferred to serve as the chairman of the Chahar Province, and cannot serve concurrently. The committee member Pan Xiuren was reassigned to replace him.</p>
<h3>Pensions for Martyrs and Party Members to be Adjusted; Central Standing Committee Resolves</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Central Standing Committee passed a resolution today to adjust the pensions for martyrs and party members. The main points are as follows: The Central Pension Committee will increase the amount of pensions for martyrs and party members, and the amount for this year will be issued at 100 times the amount stipulated by regulations. One-time pensions and one-time subsidies will still be appropriately increased with reference to the assessment. The assessed amount for special pensions will be increased to 200,000 yuan. However, the pensions for civil servants this year have been increased to 500 times the original amount. For example, someone with a monthly income of 800 yuan receives an annual pension of 480,000 yuan, while the highest annual pension for party members is only 90,000 yuan, a huge difference. There is a need for adjustment. The following three measures have been decided: (1) starting from the 36th year, all annual pensions and annual subsidies for martyrs and party members will be issued at 500 times the amount stated on the certificate; (2) one-time pensions and one-time subsidies will still be appropriately increased with reference to the assessment, but the assessed amount for special pensions will be increased to 1,000,000 yuan; and (3) if necessary due to factual needs in the middle of the 36th year, adjustments may be made again with reference to the civil servant pension increase measures.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Aviation Company to Increase Airfare</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 30th] The Sino-Soviet Aviation Company flights between Hami in our country and Almaty in the Soviet Union will soon increase airfare. Currently, a full ticket from Hami to Almaty on the company's flights costs only over 5,000 yuan in national currency, 1,500 yuan for the Hami line within our country, and over 2,500 yuan for the Diyi line. After the price increase, a full ticket will cost over 350,000 yuan. The company is a joint venture between China and the Soviet Union, and the ten-year term will expire in 1949.</p>
<h3>Incident of U.S. Warship in Dalian</h3>
<p>Soviet Union Accuses U.S. Reporter of Fabricating Facts</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 30th] The Zhenli Bao today published a TASS news item from the 26th, describing the arrival of a U.S. dispatch ship in Dalian, stating that the U.S. dispatch ship was actually a warship, and that the U.S. reporter Newton's reports on this incident and the Soviet Union's "ultimatum" to the U.S. warship were clearly deliberately fabricated to sensationalize the news. The news item stated that the Soviet side in Dalian did not receive notice of the U.S. warship's arrival at the port until the evening of December 18, while the U.S. warship had already arrived in Dalian. The U.S. Embassy in Nanjing had notified the Soviet Embassy that the ship was only carrying letters to the U.S. Consul in Dalian and did not mention that it was carrying passengers. However, the ship was actually carrying two U.S. reporters and a representative from the Mobil Oil Company. Since the Soviet side did not receive notification that the ship was carrying passengers, it refused to allow them to land. The ship remained in Dalian for several hours after the 48-hour deadline given by the Soviet side, waiting for the ship's captain, who had been summoned ashore by the U.S. Consul.</p>
<h3>China and the Soviet Union are Not in a State of War with Japan; We Have the Right to Take Over Dalian; U.S. Policy Toward China Will Urge the Soviet Union to Abide by the Sino-Soviet Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao told the press today that the Soviet Embassy officially notified the National Government on May 23, stating that the Soviet army had completely withdrawn from the nine eastern provinces on May 3, 1946, and that "Dalian is of course an integral part of the nine eastern provinces," so the Soviet government has "handed over its continued control of Dalian in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty." Ye declined to explain the details of the Chinese Communist Party's obstruction of the government, but reiterated that this is the only reason why the National Government has not yet taken over Dalian. He also said: "We believe that there is currently no state of war between China and the Soviet Union and Japan. China has the full right to take over Dalian according to law. Government troops advanced to within a few miles of Dalian several weeks ago and stopped attacking. This was clearly out of fear of a possible conflict with the Soviet garrison, not because of the presence of communist troops in the area."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 30th] The American Policy Association on China has objected to State Department spokesman Whitsell's claim that the Soviet Union should have military control over Dalian. The association demanded that the U.S. government should force the Soviet Union to comply with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which states that when direct conflicts cease, China shall have the full right to deal with matters relating to the civilian population.</p>
<h3>Communist Military Mobilization Frequent in the Northeast; Tension Still High Around Baoding; Government Troops in Western Shanxi Continue to Recover Ma Dou Pass</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] It is reported that there have been conflicts between government and communist troops in Dongjiaohe, Jilin, and the flames of war seem to be pointing towards Dunhua. It is also reported that Ji'an in southeast Tonghua has long been in the hands of government troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] It is reported that communist military mobilization has been frequent in the Northeast recently. In the Yangjiadian and Sandao Gou areas near Huadian, a unit of the 24th Brigade of communist troops, about 2,000 people, has been secretly moved from Yanji. About three regiments of the 2nd Communist Army, one-third of whom are Koreans, have recently sneaked into the villages in southern Huadian. Mu Ling Liu Shouqi seems to have intentions of invading Huadian.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 30th] The outskirts of Baoding are still tight. The number of communist troops 15 li outside the city has increased to 60,000. After the communist troops in Huangxie withdrew, the government troops gave up their garrison. On the 29th, more than 10,000 communist troops were transferred from southern Baoding and western Hebei to the vicinity of Fangshun Bridge, surrounding Wangdu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th] After capturing Yonghe and Taining, the communist troops in southwestern Shanxi went on to occupy Ma Dou Pass in order to connect with Yan'an and form a transportation route, thereby controlling the entire western Shanxi. In addition to the government troops recovering Da Ning on the 24th, they also recovered Ma Dou Pass on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih Returns to Beiping, Dongdan Incident Relatively Milder Than Before, Student Parade Also Passes Peacefully</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 30th Dispatch] Due to Hu Shih's return to Beiping to preside over Beida's affairs, the Dongdan incident's situation has become relatively milder than before. After Hu's return, he immediately discussed with the Beiping Xingyuan the method for resolving the case of American soldiers raping female students. At 5 PM that evening, he also convened an administrative meeting of Beida. Today, Hu met with reporters and expressed his attitude towards the case, saying: "This time, the American soldiers' rape of female students has made students, professors, and myself extremely indignant. Asking them to hold meetings and parades is all permissible, but boycotting classes will delay their studies, which is not appropriate. This unfortunate incident is a legal issue, while the withdrawal of American troops from China is a political issue, and the two should not be discussed together. The remedial solutions proposed by the American military are probably acceptable, but they should be resolved quickly and not delayed. The American military does not understand the characteristics of Eastern morality, so they may not yet understand the Chinese people's indignation."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 30th Telegram] Hu Shih flew back to Beiping from Nanjing at 2:10 PM today. Hu denied to reporters the rumors that he would be appointed as the Premier of the Executive Yuan or Minister of Education. Before leaving Nanjing, he did not participate in discussions on the Inner Mongolia issue. He said: "All rumors about me are untrue. I am currently focusing on the research of the 'Shui Jing Zhu' [Commentary on the Water Classic], and have already written three prefaces to the 'Shui Jing Zhu'." A reporter asked whether the current National Assembly was a manifestation of China's politics moving towards democracy. Hu replied: "This National Assembly is a large training class or university. Given the vastness of China, it is not easy for representatives from various regions to gather in one place and even understand each other's speech. This can be said to be a good preliminary training."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th Telegram] Hu Shih returned to Beiping from Nanjing by a Central Aviation aircraft at 11:00 AM on the 30th. Fu Sinian, Yang Lianggong, and others went to the airport to see him off. Before departing, Hu told reporters that because there were many school affairs to be dealt with, he would not come south for the time being after returning to Beiping. He was not yet aware of the details of the American soldiers case in Beiping, and would handle it according to the law. A reporter asked about the people of Anhui requesting a change of the provincial chairman, and Hu replied that he hoped a civil official faction would be sent to preside over it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping 30th Telegram] Students from various universities in Beiping went on strike for one day today and held a parade in the afternoon to protest the American soldiers' brutal rape of a female student. More than 2,000 students from parts of eight schools, including Beida, Tsinghua, Yanjing, Fu Jen, Normal College, Sino-French University, Jiaotong University, and Chaoyang University, gathered at Beida at 1:00 PM and set off for the parade at 1:30 PM. They passed through Huangchenggen, Donghua Gate, Wangfujing, Shuaifuyuan, Dongdan, and Xianmen, turned back to Nan Chizi and Bei Chizi, and returned to Beida to disperse. The parade procession lingered at the entrance of the military mediation department for a relatively long time. The order along the way was very good. In the afternoon, more than 30 student representatives from various schools went to Xingyuan to petition. Yanjing representative Ma Jianxing and Tsinghua representative Li Zhongli entered to present their opinions. Director Li of Xingyuan was out on official business, and Section Chief Zhang met with them on his behalf, promising to forward the written appeal. The representatives then withdrew and returned to school.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 30th Telegram] Today, the parade of students in Beiping passed peacefully. In advance, the U.S. Marine Corps had instructed all U.S. troops in Dongdan not to go out. Several thick iron chains were tied at the entrance of the Dongdan U.S. military barracks to prevent U.S. troops from going out and to prevent students from rushing in. The police authorities were strictly on guard in Dongjiaomin Lane. The American residence (i.e., the current U.S. Consulate) was guarded by Chinese police. All the main intersections leading to various places in the Dongjiaomin Lane area were guarded by many police officers, and fire hydrants were prepared to prevent any emergencies. The iron gate of the military mediation department was tightly closed, and even the gaps in the door were sealed with student slogans. More than two hundred students from China University also joined the parade, but their views were different. Fortunately, due to the disparity in numbers, no new incidents were caused. Today, a small number of police officers maintained order along with the main group, and their attitude was good. It was heard that Deputy Director Zhu Weiping of the police bureau said: "If the students from Tsinghua and Yanjing are tired from walking back, I can send twenty large trucks to take them."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tianjin 30th Telegram] Nankai and Peiyang Universities in Tianjin have gone on strike starting from the 30th to protest the humiliation of female students in Beiping by American soldiers. On the night of the 29th, the two schools held separate general assemblies of all students and jointly issued a letter to compatriots across the country. The students' emotions were extremely激昂 [激昂 means impassioned]. Nanda decided to organize a committee to protest against the atrocities of the American military, while Peiyang decided to protest to Truman and immediately hold a demonstration parade. This wave is surging and激盪 [激盪 means turbulent].</p>

<h3>UNRRA Various Industrial and Mining Equipment Can Be Shipped to China in Large Quantities Next Spring, Hua Fengxiang's Negotiation Results are Extremely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>[Our City News] After the war, China's industrial and mining enterprises are in urgent need of revival, and the government authorities are very concerned about the development and restoration of industrial and mining enterprises. UNRRA has stipulated US$174,500,000 for the relief of industrial and mining equipment to China. Two months ago, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) specially dispatched Hua Fengxiang, chairman of the Industrial and Mining Equipment Business Committee, to the United States to negotiate with the General Administration on the shipment of industrial and mining materials to China. Hua returned to Shanghai the night before last. He told reporters that the negotiation was extremely satisfactory. Industrial and mining equipment worth US$170 million will be shipped to China in large quantities next spring. Currently, CRRRA has received about 20% of the total. Among this industrial and mining equipment, transportation equipment is the largest, accounting for 80% (US$140 million), and the other 20% includes railway, highway, ship, and telecommunications equipment, as well as equipment for coal mines, waterworks, electricity, construction, and machine factories. In addition, there are experimental instruments allocated to the education sector for distribution to schools, all of which are the most urgently needed materials for the restoration of China's industry and mining. Hua continued: The allocation of industrial and mining equipment in relief materials is the most difficult problem to solve. There are many reasons for this, and the most obvious are the following: (1) After the war, all countries in the world need industrial and mining equipment to help their recovery, and although the United States is an industrial country, it is difficult to meet the demand; (2) The waves of coal mine factory strikes came one after another, and the production of industrial and mining equipment was greatly reduced; (3) UNRRA's work will end, and all factories must deliver goods by next summer, which is a short time; (4) China's needs are also very large, and there is a feeling that there is too little porridge for too many monks. However, Hua believes that the results of this trip to the United States are satisfactory. China has submitted a list of required industrial and mining equipment to UNRRA, and 90% has been ordered from factories. Various equipment will flow in next spring. In addition, it has refused to accept surplus materials, because many of the surplus materials are equipment that China does not need and cannot help China's industrial and mining enterprises. Finally, talking about the housing shortage in the United States, Hua believes that the housing shortage in the United States is even more serious than in China.</p>
<h3>The Result of the Soviets Moving Away Factories in the Northeast, Our Industrial Development Regresses, Pauley's Letter to the San Francisco Newspaper Explains</h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco 30th Telegram] The San Francisco newspaper today published a letter from Edwin Pauley, the U.S. reparations commissioner, explaining that after Japan's surrender, the Soviet Union moved away industrial equipment from the Northeast, causing the Northeast's industry to come to a standstill, and even causing China's industrial development to regress for several generations. The newspaper's editorial recently analyzed Pauley's proposal to move away Japanese industrial equipment, as well as the economic situation in the East, so Pauley wrote to the newspaper's editor to explain: "The opinion that the Northeast's industry must be restored to its former state, otherwise the reparations plan will only create a dangerous industrial vacuum, is completely correct. Unfortunately, the Soviet army's removal of equipment from the Northeast during its occupation has greatly hindered the achievement of this goal. The United States' post-war policy in the Far East is to seek China's strength, stability, and unity, and to be economically self-sufficient, so that China can occupy its proper part in the economic development of a peaceful Asia. In the years around the Pearl Harbor incident, the Japanese built a huge industrial organization in the Northeast, which did contribute to Japan's economy. If this organization had remained intact, as it was on the day the Soviet army invaded, and if China had remained peaceful, the Northeast's industry could have quickly assisted China's growing economy and accelerated China's entire industrial development. The enormous capacity of the Northeast's basic industry would have enabled China to quickly absorb the industrial processing equipment that Japan used as reparations. At the same time, this would have eliminated one of the most important sources of Japan's war potential. Japan's defeat reduced its production capacity to peacetime levels, creating an economic vacuum, which China should at least be able to fill part of. However, the damage suffered by the Northeast's industry after Japan's surrender has caused China's industrial development to regress for several generations, and the policy announced by the United States has been greatly hindered. The conflict of interest between Russia and Japan in the Northeast resulted in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, and Japan acquired Russia's rights in South Manchuria. In 1906, the South Manchuria Railway Company was established, and Japan's exploitation of the Northeast became concrete, expanding from railways to many industries as a driving force to continue penetrating the mainland. In 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded and occupied the Northeast, establishing Manchukuo and further accelerating its exploitation. The Northeast is a relatively rich place, and the Northeast has abundant reserves of various natural resources that are rare in other parts of Asia. There are only a few vast areas with surplus agricultural production, and the Northeast is one of them.</p>
<h3>The Right of Overseas Chinese Vendors in the Philippines to Operate Can Be Resolved in the Short Term, The Court's Preliminary Trial Orders a Temporary Suspension of the Crackdown</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Manila 30th Telegram] The matter of overseas Chinese vendors retaining the right to operate in local public markets "will be resolved within eight days," at which time the Philippine Secretary of Finance and city government accountants must respond to the application submitted to the court by overseas Chinese vendors protesting the removal of their business locations. According to the court's request, the officials must respond within eight days from the 28th onwards. During this period, the overseas Chinese will continue to hold their stalls.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Manila 29th Telegram] The Manila District Court yesterday conducted a preliminary hearing on the market case, issuing an order prohibiting the Secretary of Finance, the Director of Finance of Manila, and the owners of various markets from forcibly expelling overseas Chinese from their stalls in the public markets. In the first instance of the case, the vendors won. Judge Ding Glason ruled to temporarily prohibit the Ministry of Finance from implementing its order to crack down on all market stalls on January 1 next year. This ruling stipulates that the vendors can be undisturbed until the court rules on the application of overseas Chinese vendors to declare the Ministry of Finance's order invalid. The applying overseas Chinese must provide a bond of 100,000 pesos (US$50,000). Local overseas Chinese are not enthusiastic about this preliminary victory. Some qualified observers even deeply believe that the overseas Chinese are destined to fail in the final trial of the case. They believe that our government should adopt a more aggressive and firm diplomatic policy and not compromise. "If the negotiations fail, the consequences can be imagined."</p>

<h3>The Sino-Thai Dispute Over the Disposal of Meranti Timber Has Been Resolved Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Bangkok 28th Telegram] The issue of the disposal of meranti timber, which has recently been disputed between China and Thailand, has been resolved satisfactorily. This batch of meranti timber, totaling more than one million meters and worth 20 million Thai baht, originally belonged to four British companies in this area. After Thailand declared war on Britain and the United States in 1942, it recognized this timber as enemy property and confiscated it, and the Thailand Timber Company, run by the Thai government, auctioned it off. After Thailand and Britain established a friendly treaty, Thailand, in order to fulfill its treaty obligations, issued an order in June of this year to register all meranti timber and prohibit its sale and any changes, so that the above-mentioned timber could be purchased at a low price and returned to the British companies. After the issuance of this order, our overseas Chinese timber merchants and sawmills suffered serious losses due to the suspension of sawing work, timber decay, and falling timber prices. Our embassy in Thailand consulted with the Thai authorities on this matter in October of this year, requesting them to protect the interests of our overseas Chinese. It is reported that the Thai authorities have now agreed to abandon their plan to repurchase this timber purchased by our overseas Chinese merchants and stored in the sawmills of overseas Chinese, and our overseas Chinese timber merchants and sawmills have regained the freedom to trade and engage in sawing.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th Telegram] The Sino-French negotiations, which were suspended due to the deteriorating situation in Vietnam, have made no progress in recent days.

<h3>Our Judge at the Far East International Tribunal, Mei Ru'ao, Returns to Shanghai, Says that the Trial of War Criminals Can Be Completed Next Summer</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Dr. Mei Ru'ao, judge and Chinese representative to the Far East International Military Tribunal, departed from Tokyo by U.S. military plane a few days ago. Due to weather conditions, he arrived in Shanghai at night. Yesterday, reporters visited him. According to Mei, the East Asia International Tribunal has been working very actively since the trial began on June 3. However, due to the complexity of the case, the vast scope, and the wide range of involvement, the number of witnesses and exhibits, and the number of documents and files are unprecedented in the history of world justice. In addition, the difficulties in language translation and the thoroughness of the trial procedure have caused the progress to be slower than expected by the general public. Currently, the prosecution has completed providing evidence, and the trial can be considered to have come to an end. Next is the defendant's defense stage, which is expected to begin in mid-January, and finally the evaluation and judgment. It is estimated that the entire work of the court will be completed in May or June. Mei also said that he was sent to the East in March of this year and has been there for nine months. During this time, he was ordered by MacArthur's headquarters to accompany the American judge to China. This time, he is taking advantage of the New Year's holiday to return home to report to the authorities on the organization and current situation of the court, and to collect reference books and materials needed for the trial. When asked about the date of his return to the East, Mei said that the work of the Far East International Tribunal is becoming increasingly tense. The day when the defendant's defense takes the stage is the day when the real duel of international law and justice begins. The Tokyo trial is about to enter a serious stage. At that time, both the defendant and the prosecution will concentrate their minds and show their skills. He decided to take a U.S. military plane back to Japan on January 8 so that he could participate in the 正　決鬥序幕之　, 開 [正　決鬥序幕之　, 開 this appears incomplete and may be a typographical error from the original newspaper, this is translated to 'the opening of the prelude to this duel'].</p>

<h3>Indictment of War Criminal Tani Hisao</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] War criminal Tani Hisao of the Nanjing Massacre case, since being taken into custody by the Ministry of National Defense Military Tribunal, and after successive investigations by Chief Prosecutor Chen Guangyu, together with other prosecutors, has gathered over nine hundred victim and witness statements collected by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Nanjing Temporary Council. More than forty people have testified in court. After repeated reports, the case has now been prosecuted. The indictment is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Defendant: Tani Hisao, male, 65 years old, Japanese, residing in Tokyo, military officer.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned defendant's War Criminal Case No. 35, Investigation Division of the 35th year of the Republic of China, has been concluded after investigation. It is deemed that prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and legal provisions violated are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Facts</p>
<p>Tani Hisao, a resident of Fujimi-cho, Nakano-ku, Tokyo, Japan, graduated from the Japanese Army Academy and the Army University. He was a radical soldier in the Japanese invasion movement, serving his entire life in military posts, including as an instructor and captain in the Army Academy's student brigade, a member of the General Staff Headquarters, and an instructor at the Army University. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he served as Chief of Staff of the 3rd Division, transferred to Jinan, Shandong, and other places in our country, obstructing our country's unification movement. He was then transferred to the General Staff Headquarters as Chief of the Exercise Section and Chairman of the Military Investigation Committee of the Ministry of the Army. In August of the 26th year of the Republic of China, he led troops to China and fought at the Yongding River under the command of Kashiki. He then advanced towards Baoding and Shijiazhuang. On the way, he allowed his subordinates to arbitrarily rob residents, including Chen Sizhe's family, of twenty-eight boxes of clothing and antiques, as well as redwood furniture and other items, and forced Chinese women to provide sexual comfort. He then joined forces with the reserve troops of the Ushijima Misamatsu Divisions, forming one army called the Yanagawa Corps. After landing at Hangzhou Bay in early November, they advanced from Hangzhou to Kunshan, Taihu Lake, and directly attacked Nanjing, capturing Zhonghua Gate. On the morning of December 13th of that year, they entered the city and were stationed in the area outside Zhonghua Gate. On the 17th and 18th, the criminal participated in the city entry ceremony and memorial service to promote his power and to destroy our country's spirit of resistance and national consciousness. Together with the Nakajima Koso Corps, he launched the Nanjing Massacre, which shocked the world and was an unprecedented catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of victims. The crimes of his troops during their stay from December 13th to 21st, a period of more than a week, included: first, massacre, including killing more than nine hundred people, such as Li Jinyou, Wang Zhenquan, Chen Jinfu, Zhang Shucheng, Zhou Hongshi, and Han Mashi, by shooting, stabbing, and other cruel methods in places such as Ji'e Suo, Nancun, Shazhouwei, Saihongqiao, Jihecun, Shegongqiao, Shuangqiao, and Yuhuatai outside Zhonghua Gate, and in areas such as Mendong Zhongying, Zhuanlong Lane, Cangmenkou, Jinxiufang, Renhouli, Zhanyuan Road, and Lianziying inside the city. Regarding the reasons for the killings, Wu Xueshi and others were killed for refusing to be drafted, Li Youming and others were killed even after completing their corvée labor, Yin Decai and others were killed for trying to put out fires, and Zhang Gongcai and others were killed for pleading while houses were burning. Li Sunshi was killed for seeking refuge in an air-raid shelter, Han Mashi and dozens of others were killed because they ran out of firewood and rice after being forced to provide them, Zhao Lushi and others were killed for refusing to hand over their daughters, Zhou Zhangshi and others were killed for resisting rape, Yang Liushi and others were raped or gang-raped and then killed, Zhang Shizhun and others were killed for protecting their children, and Wang Ermao was killed for crying after seeing his parents murdered. Regarding the means of killing, Deng Jiajun killed them all at once, Sheng Huailian forced them to kneel and then killed them, Feng Tianxiang and others killed them collectively, Mo Qidong and others tortured them before killing them, Cheng Yongqing stabbed them and then strangled them, and Tong Zhangyu and others were shot and then their bodies were burned. There was nothing that could not be killed, no one who could not be killed, no place where they could not be killed, and no method that could not be used to kill. It was truly a disgrace in the history of modern civilization. Secondly, rape, including raping Chen Ergun and gang-raping Yang Liushi and others, more than forty people in total, in areas such as Shazhouwei, Saihongqiao, and Jiuer Lane, Andemen inside and outside the city. Thirdly, wanton destruction of property, including Sheng Shifu, Zhang Laocun, and more than ten households in the above-mentioned areas. The various crimes are too numerous to mention. After the end of the war, the criminal was arrested in Tokyo, Japan, and was transferred to China by the Chinese delegation in Japan. He was then transferred to the court by the War Criminals Management Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense for investigation.</p>
<p>(2) Reasons</p>
<p>It is found that the defendant devoted his life's energy to promoting Japan's national policy of conquering East Asia by first conquering China. He served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters, Chief of the Exercise Section, and Chairman of the Military Investigation Committee of the Ministry of the Army, participating in the conspiracy of aggression and supporting the aggressive actions against our country. He served as an instructor and captain at the Army Academy, as well as Chief of Staff, Brigade Commander, and Division Commander, training military talents and troops with aggression as their goal. He also advanced troops into our country, obstructed our country's unification movement, infringed upon our country's sovereignty, and participated in the aggressive war against us. This fact can be verified by various actions and announcements by the Japanese Cabinet, such as the Konoe Statement, the Hirota Three Principles, and the East Asia New Order. The report of Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Kwantung Army, to the Japanese Minister of the Army, and the file of war criminal Sakai Takashi, who was ordered by Sakai Takashi, Chief of Staff of the North China Garrison Army, to launch aggressive actions in North China, can be used as evidence. The defendant has also admitted to serving in various positions, and there is a resume written by himself on file as proof, which is consistent with the above. It is found that the defendant, wherever he marched, robbed Chen Sizhe of twenty-eight boxes of clothing and antiques, as well as redwood furniture, in Baoding, Hebei. Near Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, he extorted firewood and rice from Han Mashi and others, and then killed them when they ran out. Such crimes have been testified by the victim, Chen Sizhe, who is currently a judicial official, and dozens of eyewitnesses, such as Huang Changqing, respectively. The Capital District Procuratorate and the Nanjing Temporary Council have also sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts. It is also found that the defendant raped Zhou Dingshi and Chen Ergun and three others in Shazhouwei inside and outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, raped Liu Shiqin and four others in Saihongqiao, and raped or gang-raped Wu Damu and more than ten others in various places in Jiuer Lane Huangnitang. On the march and in Yuhuatai and other places in Nanjing, he forced Chen Wangshi and others to provide girls for sexual comfort. The above facts have also been testified by the victims or eyewitnesses Chen Shixing, Liu Lishi, Chen Ergun, Wu Lishi, Zhu Xiugu, and Jia Xueshu, who have respectively provided written statements or testified in court, and have been verified by the District Procuratorate and the Temporary Council as true. It is also found that the defendant shot and killed Li Jinyou and three others at Ji'e Suo inside and outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, shot and killed Wang Zhuquan and two others in Nancun, shot and killed Chen Jinfu and four others in Shazhouwei, shot and killed Zhou Xiaoerzi and hundreds of others in various places in Mendong, stabbed Xia Shulan and eight others at Xinlukou, stabbed Zhao Dian and dozens of others in various places in Yuhuatai, and collectively massacred Guangshan and more than eighty others in Zhengjue Temple, Yuhua Road, Shiguanyin, and Sifangcheng. In Tucheng Tou Gao Tibai Village and other places, he tortured and then killed Zhang Lishi, Lao Hou Mo Qidong and others. In West Street and other places, he killed Zhang Zhangyu and others and then burned their bodies. In addition to the witnesses Huang Xiuyin, Lu Long, Wang Wanshi, Lu Zhangshi, Wang Tianshi, Wang Dangyou, and dozens of others who have respectively provided written statements or testified in court to prove the facts, there are also investigative files that can be used as evidence. It is also found that the defendant wantonly destroyed the property of Chen Shenshi, Wang Ziting, Chen Changyu, Feng Zhaomei, Liu Hanyin and other households in Changle Road, Zhonghua Gate, Yingfu Street and other places. There are victims or eyewitnesses Ding Wanhe, Chen Shenshi, Chen Changyu, Ye Yaoshi and others who have respectively provided written statements or testified in court, and there are also annotations from investigators, which can be used as corroborating evidence.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for Relations Between Our Country and the Holy See</h3>
<p>The Holy See's envoy, Li Baoli, presented his credentials to our Chairman the day before yesterday, truly opening a new page in relations between China and the Holy See. Relations between the Holy See and China began in the Yuan Dynasty, but afterwards, overland transportation between Europe and Asia was blocked, and relations between our country and the Holy See were severed. In the late Ming Dynasty, Europeans came east by sea, and Catholic missionaries returned to our country. At that time, it was after the so-called Reformation in Europe, and St. Ignatius Loyola, witnessing the difficulties of the time, founded the Society of Jesus, dedicated to using scholarship to evangelize in the so-called Counter-Reformation. The spread of this trend greatly enhanced the reputation of the Catholic Church. Those who came to China in the late Ming Dynasty were the earlier Jesuits, adhering to the Society's doctrine of evangelizing through scholarship. These missionaries from the East often wore Confucian attire and interacted with the literati of the time. Prominent figures such as Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao were baptized and embraced the faith, so Catholicism was once very prosperous at that time. When the Ming Dynasty was about to collapse, members of the imperial family even wrote to the Pope of the time, showing the popularity of Catholicism at that time. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Ming system was still followed, so Catholicism could also be spread. Later, Yongzheng issued an edict banning religion, and the Church also issued an order prohibiting the worship of Confucius and ancestors, which greatly impacted the spread of Catholicism. It was not until after 1840, when the great powers began to sign unequal treaties with us, that the spread of Catholicism in China was guaranteed by treaties. From the late Qing Dynasty to the 12th year of the Republic of China, although both China and the Holy See had the desire to establish relations, it was never implemented. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, the Holy See sent Archbishop Celso Costantini to China as the first papal representative to China, and established the Apostolic Delegation in Beiping, which was the first normal relationship established between the Holy See and China. Later, Archbishop Costantini returned to his country, and the Pope appointed Archbishop Mario Zanin to succeed him. Until August of this year, the Holy See made its first appointment of an ambassador to China. The establishment of direct relations between the Holy See and our country had already been seen twenty years ago when Archbishop Costantini came to the East as the first papal representative to China. It does not start with the current envoy, Li Baoli; however, Li Baoli comes in the capacity of a diplomatic representative, and his arrival indicates the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between China and the Holy See. This is why Li Baoli's inauguration opens a new page in relations between China and the Holy See.</p>
<p>China sending an ambassador to the Holy See was a major achievement of our country's wartime diplomacy. At that time, the war was raging and transportation was blocked, so the Holy See did not send an envoy to China. After the end of the war, there was a proposal to send a diplomatic envoy to China. Now that Envoy Li has taken office, and diplomatic relations between China and the Holy See have been established, it is indeed a matter of gratification. The Holy See is where the Pope of the Catholic Church resides, and since the Eastern migration of the Roman Empire, the place where the Pope resides has been specialized. Its territory includes not only Rome, but also the central part of Italy, forming a country of its own. Therefore, the Pope is not only the leader of Catholics worldwide, but also the head of the country directly ruled by the Pope. This directly ruled country was destroyed by the rise of the Savoy Dynasty of Italy, but after the First World War, the Lateran Treaty between Italy and the Holy See re-established the status of the Pope's residence. Legally speaking, the Vatican, where the Holy See is located, is also an independent country, with its own system. Because it is an independent country, it can also establish diplomatic relations with other countries. However, the Vatican covers only a little more than one hundred acres, which is equivalent to a large private estate. It is not because of the Vatican that we have the establishment of diplomatic relations, but because there is the Holy See in the Vatican that we have the establishment of diplomatic relations. What we are establishing now is not diplomatic relations between our country and the Vatican, but diplomatic relations between our country and the Holy See. We are sending an envoy to the Holy See (The Holy See), not to the Vatican (Vatican). The Holy See is also sending an Apostolic Internuncio, not a Vatican envoy. This is a point that we must recognize clearly: therefore, we can say Sino-US relations, Sino-British relations, but the relationship between China and the Holy See cannot be simply referred to as Sino-Vatican relations.</p>
<p>Now that we have established diplomatic relations with the Holy See, we must ask what the purpose of establishing these diplomatic relations is. Perhaps we cannot ask about the purpose of diplomatic relations, but the establishment of general diplomatic relations is undoubtedly to seek to enhance friendly, amicable, commercial, cultural, and other aspects of relations between the two countries. Countries interact with each other, and in addition to general friendship treaties, there are also the signing of commercial navigation treaties to serve as general guidelines for relations between the two countries. Our country and the Holy See have an agreement to exchange envoys; now that the appointed envoy to the Holy See has also come to China, what should be done urgently between our country and the Holy See is the signing of a treaty on religious affairs, because the central work of the Holy See is evangelization, and its envoy also has the word Apostolic, which carries the meaning of evangelization; unlike general countries, we can have treaties of commerce and navigation, but with the Holy See, we must have treaties on religious affairs. Now that we have established diplomatic relations with the Holy See, we should continue to sign treaties on evangelization and religious affairs. With this treaty, the Catholic Church in China will have its legal status—because a treaty is equivalent to a law. Speaking of the Catholic Church in China, we must recognize this point, that the Catholic Church in China has French priests, American priests, Italian priests, local priests, and even priests from Hungary, Poland, and Russia. Although they have different nationalities, they all serve the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is indivisible: the Catholic Church in China is a single entity, and there is no room for division within it. In the past, French priests had the treaties we signed with France as protection, and American priests had their treaties as protection. But today, we can no longer deal with religious affairs in the spirit of handling "foreign affairs." We must have an understanding of the "religious affairs" themselves. The Catholic Church is a whole, and the local bishop is a Chinese church even if he is not Chinese; because the foundation of the Catholic Church is not the bishop but the parishioners. Precisely because of the complex situation of the Catholic Church in China, we need to conclude a treaty with the Holy See to determine the status of the Catholic Church in China. Although the church system has been established in China, the Catholic Church in China has not yet reached the point of self-sufficiency. In all of China, in addition to the twenty archdioceses, there are more than one hundred dioceses: we cannot divide them; they are all one body.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is a large organization. Even in China, although the percentage of Catholics in the national population is not high, there are already more than four million people. In such a large organization, it is inevitable that there will be those of mixed quality. The three words "Catholic Church" cannot be regarded as a guarantee of good behavior, which is of course a matter of course, and not surprising. However, our government, from the chairman down, cares for Catholicism. Due to the establishment of diplomatic relations between our country and the Holy See, we hope that our country and the Holy See can sign a treaty on religious affairs, so that the Catholic Church in China can develop on the right track.</p>
<h3>Incident of Female Students Being Abused in Beiping</h3>
<p>Since the so-called case of American soldiers abusing female students occurred in Beiping, the situation has become increasingly serious, and there is a tendency to spread to Shanghai. We deeply regret the occurrence of this unfortunate incident; however, we cannot help but feel regret that the situation has escalated to this point. If this is a case of abusing female students, we must clarify two things: one is the question of facts, and the other is the question of law. Whether it is a rape case must be determined through judicial trial in a normal democratic country ruled by law. The jury system in the Anglo-American legal system is for determining whether a crime has been committed. After the fact of the crime is determined, it is the responsibility of the judge to impose a sentence according to law. Now that the party accused of the crime is a soldier, it should also go through military justice procedures. If the military court's judgment is improper, then means outside of the law can be used. Therefore, before the facts and the issue of sentencing are determined and announced, what we need is calmness. Before the situation is clear, there are so-called strike movements, and even movements to have American troops withdraw from China. This is not only making a mountain out of a molehill, but it also shows that we are not trained in democratic politics; when singing praises of democracy today, one cannot help but feel a little regret. The movement to ask American troops to withdraw from China did not start with the case of female students being abused in Beiping; general anti-American movements did not start today either. This newspaper has previously published articles on this movement, believing that it is contrary to the wishes of the Chinese people. Now that the National Assembly has closed successfully and the national constitution has been formulated, those who fear that China will not be in chaos are deliberately trying to launch some kind of movement to make things difficult for the Chinese people. The unfortunate incident in Beiping has created a spark. If it is determined that the crime did occur, we believe that the American authorities will certainly have a just resolution; we do not need to have any expanded actions. We do not need to investigate the motives of those who have expanded actions; those with discerning eyes will naturally understand. What we regret is that even professors who are role models have become involved in reckless actions without understanding the facts. What we want to state here is that the unfortunate incident in Beiping is a legal issue, and we should wait for the sanctions of the law. In this regard, we cannot help but mention: (1) From the standpoint of the country, higher education in China is mostly supported by the state; university authorities should consider the state's intention to cultivate talent, so that education and the state are integrated. If the case of female students being abused causes a strike at a national university, it means that the universities supported by the state have failed the state. (2) From the standpoint of the people, the people send their children to universities supported by the state, which is the people's trust in the state and in the universities. The principals who bear the responsibility of university education should consider the heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the state and the people, and work hard, but it is heard that there are those who have abandoned their posts, causing student strikes. This is truly heartbreaking. We want to appeal to all universities not to have expanded actions because of this incident of female students being abused; it is not that we should not care about the abuse of female students, but that we should show our spirit of democracy and the rule of law. What we need is the stability that the people of a democratic country should have.</p>

<h3>Squad Leader of a New Recruit Unit in Changshu Extorts and Commits Violence; Thousands of Citizens Kneel and Petition; Military and Police Organs are on Alert All Night to Prevent Accidents</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch] Wang Yanrong, Dong Youshan, Luo Yun and other three squad leaders of the Second Squad of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the Wu Regiment Management District's new recruits, on the grounds that a new recruit, Wang Yin, had deserted at Xiaguan, Nanjing, went to the house of Wei Xiumin, a resident of the Fifth Bao of Tannan Town in the urban area, on the morning of the 28th, broke down the door and entered, arbitrarily searching, attempting to extort a huge sum of three million yuan, and beat Huang Yaozhang, the Bao Chief of the Fourth Bao of the town, which aroused public anger. More than a thousand citizens gathered, demanding an investigation. At that time, the squad leader, Jiang Ruixi, arrived with seven or eight people in uniform and plainclothes, forcibly releasing Wang Yanrong and the other two. After a while, the local self-defense patrol passed by and was stopped by all the citizens, who seized the squad leader, Jiang, and reported to the patrol, demanding that he be brought to justice. After unsuccessful persuasion, they accompanied him to the county government. Unexpectedly, more than a thousand citizens, with boiling blood, also followed to the county government gate, kneeling and petitioning. Traffic was blocked for a time. Fortunately, the county government handled the matter properly and dispersed the crowd. After questioning by Chen Shishi, the chief of the military affairs section, it was reported that, because the matter was serious, the Commander Du of the regiment management district was consulted overnight. After the incident, public sentiment was indignant. The heads of various towns, baos, and jias, and the fire brigade, responded in unison, determined to provide full support. The County Council and the County Party Headquarters have been closely following the matter. After learning late at night that the Yuanhe Town Self-Defense Force had received a strange phone call, the county government put military and police organs on high alert to prevent accidents. As of the 29th, the matter had not been resolved.</p>
<h3>Clearing and Suppressing is Intensified on the Border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Rewards are Offered for the Capture of Bandit Leaders; The Taihu Lake Clearing and Suppression District Headquarters is Temporarily Suspended from Being Abolished</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] According to a person from the Wuxi Command Post: The jurisdiction of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Clearing and Suppression District covers six counties, including Liyang, Yixing, Changxing, Yicheng, Guangde, and Langxi. Since Chuan Jin Fang Shi took over as commander, the security in the area has gradually become peaceful. However, there are still bandits such as Xiong Zhaoren, Zhang Zhiyi, Xu Daozhen, Li Huan, Ma Xiao, Fu Jiaqi, Hu Qiuzhen, Tang Songlin, Wu Qichang, and others, who are fearless of the law and independently raise the banner of rebellion. Although they have been repeatedly offered amnesty, they still roam around in the counties, causing disturbances as before. Currently, in addition to sending troops to search and suppress, Commander Chuan, in view of the fact that the area is full of overlapping mountains and is very easy to hide, in order to achieve results as soon as possible, has specially offered rewards for their capture. Regardless of whether they are military or civilian personnel, whoever can capture any bandit leader alive will be rewarded with 500,000 yuan. Those who report and seize bandit weapons will also be rewarded accordingly. Commander Fu is currently going to various counties in the jurisdiction, such as Dingshu District, Heqiao District, and Xushe in Yixing, to inspect and review the self-defense forces, and convene meetings of military and political leaders in various places to provide guidance on the clearing and suppression policy.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] The Taihu Lake Clearing and Suppression Command Post stationed in Mu Dun was originally scheduled to be abolished after its mission was completed. However, the Wuxi Command Post, in view of the fact that the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border area is launching a large-scale encirclement and suppression, fearing that bandits will take advantage of the situation to break into Taihu Lake, has withdrawn its order. On the 30th, it ordered the Taihu Lake Command Post to continue to exist for another month to prevent them from entering.</p>

<h3>Huaiyin Initiates Winter Relief Efforts, Strictly Prohibits Hoarding and Smuggling of Grain</h3>
<p>[Our Huaiyin News] Since the recovery of Huaiyin, nine out of ten households are empty and the people's livelihood is withering. Now that winter is approaching, the situation is becoming more difficult. In accordance with the provisions of the relief implementation measures promulgated by the ministry, and with reference to the current local situation, various sectors have established a winter relief committee to provide small loans, set up porridge distribution centers, and distribute relief funds and materials for relief. The relief targets include widowers, widows, orphans, the elderly, the weak, the disabled, refugees, families of soldiers who fought in the war, impoverished families, those whose family members died or went missing in the war and whose families are not supported, those whose houses and properties were completely destroyed and have no place to live, those who have lost their ability to work due to illness and have no one to support them, those who have lost their jobs due to the war and have no permanent property to maintain their lives, and those whose lives have been affected by the war and cannot live in the short term, in addition to those who can live. Considerable relief will be provided to all these groups. Currently, applications are being made to relief agencies to discuss assistance from local charitable organizations, and to allocate funds, food, or clothing. Applications are being made to the county government to transfer local public funds or stored grain, and to raise funds from local wealthy households, large merchants, and industrial and commercial groups. Charity performances and charity sales will also be held to raise funds and materials. Investigations will begin on January 1st next year, and relief will be implemented on the 15th, ending on March 31st.</p>
<p>[Our Huaiyin News] Prices in Huaiyin are slowly increasing, and the lives of ordinary people are extremely difficult. Recently, some merchants, ignorant of the public interest, have hoarded food, manipulated prices, or even smuggled goods out of the area in order to obtain huge profits, resulting in a surge in the prices of various grains, which has a significant impact on the people's food supply. In view of this, the county government issued a strict ban yesterday, stating that those who deliberately violate the ban will be severely punished once discovered.</p>

<h3>Indictment Against War Criminal Tani Hisao (Continued from Page 2)</h3>
<p>In summary, the accused violated international treaties and conventions before and during the war, conspired to prepare and launch and support aggression against our country, and violated the laws and customs of war by directly or indirectly committing acts of violence. His criminal acts are indeed undeniable and cannot be excused. Although the accused repeatedly argued: (1) Before returning to Japan, I had not heard of any crimes such as rape or murder committed by my subordinates, and it is difficult to believe the so-called various atrocities; (2) There were many troops in Nanjing at that time, and even if there were crimes, it cannot be proved that they were committed by my army, and I am not responsible; (3) I strictly controlled my troops and repeatedly warned them not to commit violence against non-combatants. My troops have fought in various places and no one has accused them of any crimes, which shows that the Nanjing Massacre was not committed by my army; (4) The establishment of comfort stations was discussed with local officials and the consent of comfort women was obtained before they were established. However, the Nanjing Massacre was an action by the Japanese to destroy our country's spirit of resistance and national consciousness. During the war, too much of our country's territory fell, and there may be other places besides Nanjing where similar massacres occurred. The fact that the accused did not commit similar massacres elsewhere does not prove that there were no such atrocities in Nanjing. Moreover, his troops looted civilian property in Baoding, as evidenced by victims' testimonies on file. His subordinates were not as virtuous as he claimed. Secondly, the Nanjing Massacre claimed hundreds of thousands of victims. The first week was the peak of the massacre, which was within the accused's garrison area. According to existing evidence, there was no time or place without various atrocities occurring. The accused claimed to know or hear nothing, which clearly shows that he was afraid of investigation and resorted to deceptive arguments. Furthermore, the Nanjing Massacre is a world-known fact and there are films, photographs, various records, archives, and thousands of testimonies and dozens of witnesses testified in court. It is difficult to exempt him from criminal responsibility based on his empty claim that he could not believe the claims made. In addition, the area inside and outside Zhonghua Gate was the area garrisoned by the accused, as he himself admitted. During the period of his garrison, there were massacres, rapes, and various atrocities. The number of victims that can be proven has reached thousands. His subordinates would not commit crimes themselves and there is no reason for other troops to come to commit crimes. Moreover, other troops have their own garrison areas and their own targets for killing and raping, and there is no reason to abandon the near and seek the far. Furthermore, the troops who attacked Zhonghua Gate were the accused's troops, and they began killing as soon as they entered the city, which cannot be shifted to others. Again, Chinese women and social customs do not condone the use of the body for consolation. Even in our own army, it is impossible to obtain consent to sacrifice their beauty, let alone for enemy troops. Furthermore, the fact that he killed women in Nanjing after failing to force them to become comfort women is sufficient proof that the so-called obtaining consent was a fabrication. As for the accused's service and participation in the war in China, it was indeed in accordance with national policy and the execution of orders. However, conspiring to commit aggression and launching a war of aggression are both acts that violate international treaties and undermine international peace. Moreover, during the war, the accused wantonly engaged in slaughter, rape, and looting, which violated the laws of war and cannot be excused. The accused's various crimes leave no room for excuse. Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty both stipulate that the integrity of the territory and political independence of members and our country should be respected. The Kellogg-Briand Pact condemns war as an instrument of national policy. The Hague Convention on Hostilities also has explicit provisions. The accused initially provided strong support for the conspiracy and actions of aggression, then sent troops to Shandong to obstruct our country's reunification movement and infringe on our country's sovereignty. In the end, he participated in a war of aggression against us without declaring war, which clearly violated the provisions of these international conventions and should constitute the crime of undermining peace. Moreover, during his war in our country, he wantonly looted and destroyed property, carried out planned massacres and rapes of civilians, forced women into comfort stations, and killed them after raping them, and massacred forced laborers after their recruitment. The current atrocities such as mass killings and burning corpses violate Article 23, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 3, Paragraph 7, Article 28, Article 46, Paragraph 1, and Article 47 of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare and should constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Although the crime of undermining peace has been committed continuously for more than twenty years, and the crimes of war and crimes against humanity have been committed repeatedly, since they were all based on a general intention, they should each be treated as one crime. Furthermore, the crime of undermining peace is not related to the crimes of war and crimes against humanity as a means to an end. They should be punished separately and concurrently. Furthermore, the accused deliberately engaged in aggression, undermining international peace, infringing on our country's sovereignty, and during the war, committed various atrocities in violation of humanity and the laws of war against unarmed civilians. He also created an unprecedented catastrophe in Nanjing. He was extremely heinous and aroused the indignation of the world and should be sentenced to capital punishment to maintain justice and peace.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Paragraph 4, Article 3, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 4, Paragraph 6, Paragraph 17, Paragraph 24, Article 27, Articles 36, Article 38, Article 4, Article 8, Article 9, Article 10, Article 11 of the "Regulations on the Trial of War Criminals of the Republic of China," Article 11, Article 223 of the Criminal Law, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecution is brought. Respectfully submitted to the judges of this court, 25 December, 35th Year of the Republic of China. Chen Guangyu, Chief Prosecutor, Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals, Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>In addition to the indictment, there are thousands of words of attachments, which detail various criminal facts, divided into four parts: murder, rape, robbery, and destruction of property. Murder is further divided into four categories: 334 people shot, 195 people stabbed, 95 people collectively massacred, and 310 people killed by other cruel methods. The rape section counts 43 people, and the robbery and destruction of property section counts 17 people. (End)</p>

<h3>France Establishes Customs System in the Saar Region, Various Parties Express Deep Concern, France Claims Stationing Customs Officers Is Not Annexation, Council Does Not Reopen Old Case, Becoming Today's Topic</h3>
<p>[United Press, Saarbrücken, 29th] French officials here announced today that recent municipal elections have proven that 78% of the people in the Saar coal mining region wish to immediately rejoin France economically. French Military Governor Koenig stationed 1,200 customs officers on the border of the Saar industrial area a week ago. According to French official statements, setting up this customs cordon is not annexation, but France's stance is quite clear. Wen Beihart, editor of the non-partisan Saarbrücken newspaper, stated that most Saarlanders today hope that the establishment of this new economic border is the first step towards economic union with France. The Saar industrial area covers 738 square miles. After the end of World War I, it was handed over to France for management. In 1935, the Saar Germans voted by a large majority to return to Germany. French military government officials now believe that the Saar Germans all want to return to France because both major political parties in the Saar used reunification with France as their slogan in recent municipal elections.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] France's establishment of a customs system in the Saar region has attracted attention from all parties. [Pravda] also criticized France's move today, denouncing it as a unilateral action and refuting France's claim that the matter had been raised at the New York Foreign Ministers Conference and had not been opposed. The newspaper pointed out that the New York Foreign Ministers Conference had not discussed the German issue at all, and French Foreign Minister Representative Muville had informed the Foreign Ministers Conference that the Saar issue would be discussed with other German issues at the next Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 29th] According to reliable sources today, the United States will propose at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March next year that the old agricultural areas of eastern Germany not occupied by Poland should be returned to Germany when discussing the German peace treaty. Germany cannot survive if it loses 25% of its best farmland. The United States is expected to receive the support of the United Kingdom for this proposal, which stipulates that Poland should retain the old German agricultural areas of Silesia, half of East Prussia that is now occupied, and the former Free City of Danzig. Pommerania and Brandenburg, which are occupied by the Polish army, will all be returned to Germany. Poland has sufficient farmland to meet its own needs, and Silesia can become the country's rich industrial area. Conversely, if Germany loses the agricultural areas of Pommerania and Brandenburg, it will reduce Germany's grain production by 25%. Germany is often a grain-deficient country, and the situation is deteriorating. The Western occupying powers have no choice but to import food at huge expense to support this defeated nation. US Secretary of State Byrnes strongly hinted at the US stance in a speech he gave in Stuttgart.</p>
<h3>Allied Forces to Withdraw from Italy Next Year</h3>
<p>Italian Cabinet Discusses Political Issues</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 29th] General McGarry, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean, issued a New Year's message to the Allied Forces stationed in Italy today, predicting that British and American troops stationed in Italy could be completely withdrawn in 1947. He said that since the end of the war, until the conditions for peace can be resolved by the United Nations, Allied forces have had to remain in Italy. This is a difficult period, and both sides need goodwill and patience. The mission is almost complete, and he believes that this spirit must be maintained. If duties permit, the Allied forces are willing to withdraw from Italy as soon as possible so that Italians can develop freely.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, Rome, 29th] Italian radio recently broadcast a message stating that the Italian cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow morning, chaired by Prime Minister Gasperi, to discuss various political issues.

<h3>Jewish Zionist Movement Sub-Committee Established</h3>
<p>[France News Agency, Basel, Switzerland, 29th] The Executive Committee of the Jewish Zionist Movement today organized a fifteen-member sub-committee, granting it full power to decide whether the Jewish Zionist Movement should participate in the London Palestine Round Table Conference.

<h3>Sweden Designs New Navy</h3>
<p>To Maintain Leadership in the Baltic Sea [Reuters, Stockholm, Sweden, 30th] Sweden established an expert trust six months ago to design new ships and weapons to maintain Sweden's leading naval position in the Baltic Sea. This matter was extremely confidential, but recently the inside story has been slightly revealed. For example, naval technology expert Colonel Marai gave a semi-public speech at the Naval Association, saying that he believes that ships, although they cannot cope with the direct impact of the power of an atomic bomb, can be designed to cope with the heat, radio waves, radiation, etc. after an atomic bomb explodes.</p>
<h3>East Indian Nationalist Party Rejects Draft Independence Paper</h3>
<p>[France News Agency, Batavia, 30th] After two days of heated debate, the East Indian Nationalist Party Congress decided to reject the draft treaty of independence between the Netherlands and East India.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission Report Formally Submitted to the Security Council, Strongly Advocates Prohibition, Veto Issue Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Agencia France-Presse, Lake Success, 29th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today submitted a report to the Security Council, advocating for the complete prohibition of the manufacture and stockpiling of atomic bombs. The report also included a letter from the drafting subcommittee, explaining that no agreement had been reached on whether the veto power should be abolished in cases of violating the international convention on the control of atomic energy. The report further detailed the work of the scientific and technical subcommittee and recommended that measures be taken to prohibit the use of atomic energy, except for peaceful purposes. The illegal use of materials such as uranium and thorium is also prohibited. The method of controlling atomic energy is that all member states of the United Nations should convene a meeting to establish a strong international control and supervision system through international treaties, granting considerable authority to manage atomic energy, and no government should interfere with its work by veto. The organization may send representatives to investigate within the borders of designated countries and, within its jurisdiction, may prohibit countries from manufacturing and stockpiling atomic weapons. The organization's representatives also have the power to dispose of existing atomic weapon stockpiles. Furthermore, the international authority can determine acts that violate the terms of international conventions and take sanction measures. Once sanction measures are decided, violating countries cannot escape their responsibilities or consequences by veto. In the event of a breach of contract, the right of legitimate self-defense may be exercised in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. (Note: Article 51 stipulates that if one of the member states encounters armed aggression, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense shall not be prejudiced until the Security Council takes the necessary measures to maintain international peace and security. However, after a member state takes action to exercise this right of self-defense, it shall immediately report to the Security Council and shall not impede the Security Council's responsibility under this Charter to take action as necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.) The report concluded by recommending the gradual establishment of international control and supervisory bodies so that the Atomic Energy Commission can gradually acquire contact during the transition period.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] After the report to be submitted to the Security Council by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission was released, it was learned that the Soviet Union was unwilling to discuss the point that the veto power should not be used when sanctioning violators of the atomic treaty, and also refused to discuss the issue of aerial inspections of secret activities by international authorities.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative to the Security Council, Gromyko Promoted to Deputy Foreign Minister, Soviet Emphasis on UN Institutions Can Be Seen Here</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Cabinet met today and decided to appoint Gromyko, the current representative of the country to the United Nations Security Council, as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Soviet Union now has five Deputy Foreign Ministers: Vyshinsky, Gusev (former Ambassador to the United Kingdom), Malik, Tikhonov, and Gromyko.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 29th] Regarding Gromyko's promotion to Deputy Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, people from all walks of life here have not yet commented on it, because this news did not indicate whether Gromyko's appointment as Deputy Foreign Minister will lead to any changes in the representatives of the Soviet Union attending the Security Council and other international organizations. The general impression here is that Gromyko will continue to exercise his representative duties in the United Nations institutions. If this is the case, then the Soviet Union's emphasis on the United Nations institutions can be seen here.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Demands French Troops Withdraw from Fortified Road Repair Positions, Viet Minh Forces Shell Hanoi's Central District, Minister Moutet Arrives in Eastern Cambodia Yesterday for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Radio Viet Minh tonight demanded that General Leclerc immediately withdraw from Vietnam and also demanded that the French government recall High Commissioner for Vietnam d'Argenlieu and French Commander General Morlière. Radio Viet Minh also announced that President Ho Chi Minh had recently sent a telegram to Prime Minister Blum, accusing French troops of massacring Vietnamese women and children in Hanoi first, deliberately provoking conflict, and also demanding that French troops withdraw to their positions before February 17. Radio Viet Minh said that Ho Chi Minh's telegram was used to reply to Blum's telegram to Ho Chi Minh. It is said that Blum's telegram stated that Colonial Minister Moutet's mission to Vietnam was to restore the situation in Vietnam based on the French-Vietnamese agreement. However, a French official in Saigon denied that Blum had sent a telegram to Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 30th] The French General Staff issued a communiqué stating that Viet Minh forces were strengthening their positions near Hue and Da Nang, while continuing to shell Hanoi's central district and attack French outposts in Nam Dinh. Hanoi is constantly being shelled and slightly damaged, and French patrols are active in the city.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] French newspapers reported that 2,000 French defenders of Phu Tong City, 20 miles northeast of Hanoi, had been besieged for more than a week and were only relieved after reinforcements arrived.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 30th] Colonial Minister Moutet's initial work here has been completed, and he flew to Phnom Penh (the capital of Cambodia) this morning with his entourage to hold talks with French and Cambodian officials. French High Commissioner for Vietnam d'Argenlieu also traveled from here to Hanoi today to inspect the French troops in the region.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 29th] French sources said that Leclerc's visit to Vietnam was to study the situation of the French expeditionary force and to consider the future increase in manpower and material resources.

<p>Hanoi Compatriots' Food Panic</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 28th Special Dispatch] Hanoi's external transportation is still the same as yesterday, and the source of food has been completely cut off, and the supply situation is deteriorating. Compatriots can only buy food in the areas controlled by the Vietnamese army. Before December 19, rice was only sold for 400 Vietnamese dong per shi, but now it has risen to 2,000 Vietnamese dong per shi.

<h3>Nehru Meets Gandhi to Discuss Major Issues</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 29th] Gandhi and Nehru today discussed major issues in Gandhi's cottage in the village of Srirampur, East Bengal. People close to the Indian leader said that Nehru was asking Gandhi whether to accept or reject the British government's statement issued on December 6, which explained the provincial system recommended by the British Cabinet. On this issue, the Muslim League believes that the provincial system is mandatory, but the Congress Party does not agree with this view. The British government's statement on the 6th of this month suggested that the matter be submitted to the Indian Federal Court for adjudication. Nehru will return to Delhi tomorrow, and the All-India Congress Committee is scheduled to meet in Delhi on January 5 to discuss the British statement.

<h3>Voice of America to Broadcast in Russian Starting Next Year, Communicating Culture and Harmonizing Political Views</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] The official US radio station "Voice of America" will begin broadcasting in Russian around January 15 next year. This is the State Department's grand propaganda plan to bypass Soviet censorship and directly contact the Soviet people. Some US officials believe that this move may be one of the major events of next year, because Secretary of State Byrnes feels that the greatest difficulty in dealing with Moscow is the inability to directly convey each country's views on any issue to the Soviet people. Therefore, it was decided to use a powerful radio station newly established in Munich to broadcast to the Soviet Union with long-term programs such as news, music, and cultural discussions. The content focuses on facts and does not touch the Soviet government's taboos. If this move achieves political success, some disputes can be held in radio debates in the future, and both sides can provide opinions fairly.</p>
<h3>New American Progressive Citizens Party Founded, Wallace Also Attends and Speaks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 29th] American figures are now brewing to organize a new political party.

<h3>South African Students' Congress Protests to Smuts, Praises China, India, and the Soviet Union, Gandhi Also Writes an Article Refuting Smuts</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Johannesburg, South Africa, 29th] The South African Native National Congress recently held a meeting in Bloemfontein and passed the following resolutions: (1) Protested against South African Prime Minister Smuts' statement at the United Nations that he represents all the people of South Africa; (2) Expressed respect for the representatives of China, India, and the Soviet Union attending the United Nations General Assembly for safeguarding the democratic rights of non-European people in South Africa; (3) Determined to continue to fight against white rule until people of color obtain equal rights; (4) Urged the Executive Committee of the Congress to study the possibility of cooperating with other non-European groups.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 29th] South African Prime Minister Smuts recently accused India of the existence of class discrimination. Gandhi responded to this in a newspaper article, saying that the class discrimination in India is different from the racial discrimination in South Africa. It must be known that South Africa has laws on racial discrimination, but India has no laws on class discrimination. Class distinctions have their own religious origins, and any mentally sound Indian wants to abolish them. As for the racial discrimination in South Africa, it is the most serious, because South Africa has recently stipulated several racial discrimination measures. In short, racial barriers in India have gradually disappeared, while the South African government refuses to abolish this type of law.</p>

<h3>Year-End Sketch: Hitler's Sins Lead to German Suffering</h3>
<p>After six years of war and a year and a half of occupation, Germany is now facing hunger, disease, and unrest. Sixty million people are greeting the New Year in this situation…</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 29th] Most of Germany's 60 million people are suffering under a semi-starved rationing system. The black market devours them, poverty drives them to crime, and pulmonary disease, rickets, and other diseases are rampant. German land must help maintain the supplies for hundreds of thousands of occupying forces and nearly a million foreigners. According to United Nations estimates, more than four million Germans who need to revive their homeland have become prisoners of war. Officials of the military government in the British and American occupied zones foresee the following situations in Germany in the coming year: (1) Semi-starved rations will cause irreparable damage to children's bodies unless nutrition is improved; (2) Part of the prisoners of war will be repatriated; (3) Part of the occupying forces will be reduced; (4) Partial solution to the refugee problem.</p>
<p>Food scarcity remains Germany's biggest problem. More than four million people in the British and American occupied zones are receiving alms from the United Nations. The usual daily ration is 1,500 calories, while the minimum nutritional need set by the health authorities is 2,000 calories. There is no hope of solving this problem soon. American and British officials seem to favor giving Germany "incentive" loans for trade so that the country can export goods and earn money to pay for part of the food price. Although this move can reduce the burden on the United Nations, it cannot greatly improve the nutrition of Germans.</p>
<p>According to investigations in the British, American, and French occupied zones, pulmonary disease is prevalent, and venereal disease has been rampant in Germany since the surrender, partly due to the Allied forces. A large proportion of children born in cities after the war suffer from rickets due to a lack of Vitamin D. The black market and the sale of narcotics and alcohol are extremely prevalent. In Cologne, under British occupation, coffee sells for 300 marks per pound (equivalent to US$30), car tires for 1,500 marks each, and one carat of diamonds for 20,000 marks. Most people are extremely poor. For example, an ordinary worker in Dusseldorf earns 30 marks per week but cannot afford potatoes at five marks per pound or black market apples at twelve marks per pound and can only live on bread. Sometimes it takes twelve hours to queue for bread. The number of criminal cases reported to the city police station has increased sharply. The poor steal from neighbors. They break up wooden signs to burn as firewood, and many farmers have become petty thieves. Recently, when a train stopped briefly at Oberhausen station, three or four tons of coal were stolen in a few minutes.</p>
<p>The German army suffered seven million deaths and injuries in the war. Four million people are prisoners of war, most of whom are still abroad. Germans fear that the repatriation of most prisoners of war will be delayed for a long time. The United States plans to repatriate 100,000 German prisoners, mostly before the final peace conference. The United Kingdom plans to repatriate more than 300,000 German prisoners before 1949. However, France and the Soviet Union have expressed the need for German labor compensation for long-term reconstruction work. France holds 600,000 prisoners, while the Soviet Union holds more than 3 million prisoners. American officials expect that Soviet troops in Germany will decrease by 30% to 50% in the coming months. Marshal Stalin reported this October that there were 20 Soviet divisions in Germany. Other United Nations military circles estimate that there are 400,000 to 600,000 Soviet troops. The United States is allowed to reduce its troops to 150,000 by July next year, and the United Kingdom will reduce its troops in the same way. There are 600,000 foreign refugees in Germany, 600,000 in the American occupied zone and the rest in the British occupied zone. The stay of these people is due to the fact that they are not forced to return to Poland and Soviet territory. Most of the refugees come from these two countries. Some American officials hope that the United Nations will take over the repatriation of refugees from the military government soon.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Districts will be abolished today in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan. All unfinished cases and unprocessed materials, including enemy and puppet property materials and the property of traitors, will be transferred to the Central Trust Bureau for handling today. The bureau has established the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Districts to handle the matter, and the director of the Liquidation Office is Liu Gongyun, concurrently. The organization of the Liquidation Office has been decided to have one general secretary and one general accountant. The general secretary will be Shen Guanya, and the general accountant will be Lin Zhaotang. Under them, there will be six groups: general affairs, finance, collection, appraisal, review, and traitor property, and one commissioner's office, to handle the various unfinished affairs of the Administration. The formal handover ceremony will be held after Jiang Weixian, the special supervisor appointed by the Executive Yuan, recovers from his illness. A reporter from this newspaper visited the Director of the Administration, Liu Gongyun, yesterday to inquire about the overall situation of the Administration's receipt and handling of matters in the past year. He was told the following: (1) All enemy and puppet property received, including German property and traitor property, totaled more than 1.2 trillion yuan, exceeding the original estimate of 200 billion yuan. As of the end of this month, the handled materials amounted to 550 billion yuan, of which more than 384 billion yuan were turned over to the national treasury (about 50 billion yuan in December), and the gold deposited in the Central Bank was worth about 150 billion yuan. There are still about 700 billion yuan to be processed, including 200 billion yuan in materials, 100 billion yuan in real estate, wharves and warehouses, and 400 billion yuan in transfers from the China Textile Corporation and various state-owned business institutions, which will be transferred to the Central Trust Bureau for handling today. (2) Regarding property rights disputes: 49 factories that have been returned belong to foreigners, 196 belong to domestic owners, 31 have been approved for prior purchase by the owners, and 65 applications have been rejected. (3) The investigation team has received 2,496 secret reports, and the materials seized are worth about 40 billion yuan, of which 7.2 billion yuan have been auctioned off. The seized materials include: (1) 916 buildings, (2) 676 mu of land, (3) 81 cars, (4) 23 ships, (5) 52,277 bolts of cotton cloth, (6) 7 small factories, (7) 4,457 pieces of cotton yarn. The bonuses issued to informers are more than 1 billion yuan. Currently, the acceptance of enemy property cases has been stopped, but if the cases are too complicated, temporary liquidation offices will be allowed to handle everything, but no later than two months. As for the staff of the Administration after its dissolution, severance pay will be given to each person for four months, (one of which was specially approved by Premier Song).</p>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, which is affiliated with the Administration, will continue to exist, but the two independent units of the Traitor Property Handling Committee and the Expenditure Audit Committee will be merged into it. In the future, the Review Committee will decide on the return or confiscation of property rights and the handling of property materials. After a resolution is obtained, the Secretary-General will issue a document to handle it.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Establishment of the Constitution, a Grand Meeting to be Held on New Year's Day, Films to be Screened to Comfort Veterans</h3>

<h3>Factories to Have Three Days Off</h3>
<p>According to reports, the central party, government, and military agencies have decided to give all agencies, groups, and schools nationwide three days off starting from New Year's Day to celebrate the establishment of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the 36th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China. All localities are extremely excited. However, the original commemorative measures did not mention whether factories should have three days off uniformly. A reporter from this newspaper visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to inquire about this issue. He was told that the Social Affairs Bureau had not received the above-mentioned holiday measures, but New Year's Day is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and was originally included in the holidays, so there is no problem. The reporter also asked that if the central government's notice does confirm that factories are not included, should holidays be granted as an example? According to the reply: According to Article 9, Section 8 of the Factory Law Implementation Regulations, other holidays temporarily designated by the National Government should be followed. If the central government stipulates a uniform three-day holiday to celebrate the Constitution, it should be handled in the same way. He also said that if the central government's notice arrives too late and there is not enough time to implement it, the old lunar New Year can be used to grant holidays.</p>
<h3>Dancing Prohibited All Night on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day</h3>

Yesterday, all entertainment venues were notified to comply. It is also stipulated that all entertainment venues must close before midnight during the New Year period.</p>
<h3>Cotton Spinning Industry Annual Bonus - Distributed in Three Grades</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The unified annual bonus method for the cotton spinning industry in this city has been largely determined. The annual bonus is divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Grade A workers can receive 60 days' wages as an annual bonus, and these workers cannot exceed 5% of the total factory workers. Grade B workers can receive 50 days' wages as an annual bonus, and these workers cannot exceed 10% of the total factory workers. The remaining workers can receive 30 days' wages as an annual bonus, with an additional 10 days' wages reserved. In addition, it is stipulated that those who work for more than 16 days are counted as one month, and those who work for less than 15 days are counted as half a month. Government officials stated that this annual bonus method is the most generous among all industries and applies to both state-owned and private cotton mills. According to Director Zhao Banfu's estimate, there are about 100,000 cotton spinning workers in Shanghai, and the total amount of annual bonuses should be over 30 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management in the Silk Weaving Industry - Each Holds a Different View</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives of silk weaving factory owners in this city visited Mayor Wu and Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau last Saturday to petition and put forward three points regarding the annual bonus issue: (1) Silk factories that make a profit should pay an annual bonus of seven days' wages, with proportional calculation for those whose service period is less than one year. (2) The annual bonus wage should be calculated according to the November cost of living index. (3) Loss-making factories should not pay any annual bonus. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both sides for mediation. Only the labor representatives attended. The bureau repeatedly persuaded the workers to make concessions, and the conversation went well. It is now scheduled to convene labor and management representatives again this morning to seek a solution. According to inquiries by reporters, the reasons why the factory owners are unwilling to pay the annual bonus are: (1) Although the factory appears to be making a profit, when calculated based on inventory, it is actually a loss. (2) Even if there is a profit, it is offset by high-interest loans. (3) Wages are too high, making it difficult for factories to operate. The labor representatives' opinions are: (1) If the factory owners claim to be losing money, why is the factory equipment gradually increasing? (2) If they claim that sales are sluggish and there is no profit to be made, why add night shifts? Isn't this a contradiction? (3) Workers work 11 hours a day, which is like being treated as livestock, and the demand for an annual bonus is actually reasonable.</p>
<p>(Further News) The year-end bonus issue for silk weaving workers has not yet been resolved. Workers in some factories have already gone on strike. The Social Affairs Bureau is actively persuading them to return to work.</p>
<h3>Emergency Loan Society - Calls for Hospital Cooperation - Consultations at the Health Bureau - Receives Unanimous Support</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Emergency Loan Society, organized by Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Gu Qianlin, and others, has loaned out a total of 60 million yuan in national currency since its establishment on November 1st, benefiting a total of 212 people. 140 people have been discharged from the hospital, with appendicitis cases being the most common, followed by accidental serious injuries. Since its establishment, the society has been seen as a blessing by poor people with emergency illnesses. Currently, due to the continuous increase in medical and drug costs and doctor's fees, the amount of loans is increasing. However, hospitals have not given any special preferential treatment. In order to seek cooperation from various hospitals, a meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3:30 pm in the conference room of the Municipal Health Bureau to consult with the presidents of various hospitals. A total of seventy to eighty representatives from public and private hospitals attended. The meeting was opened by Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau, who first introduced Gu Qianlin, the president of the Emergency Loan Society, and explained in detail the rules of the emergency loan and the payment methods, as follows: (1) Relief is limited to emergency illnesses. Cases such as car accidents and lung diseases are not included in emergency loans. (2) Patients are hospitalized for treatment, limited to third-class wards and not exceeding 15 days in principle. (3) Please provide detailed invoices within the possible range and give preferential treatment to those receiving emergency loans, charging low fees. (4) Please allow payment on the day following the issuance of the hospital's bill.</p>
<p>After Director Zhang's speech, Lu Jingzhou, the leader of the Health Group of the Council, gave a detailed explanation and appealed to various hospitals to provide close cooperation in the spirit of serving the people.</p>
<p>The presidents of various hospitals who attended yesterday unanimously expressed their willingness to assist. President Gu Qianlin of the society expressed his gratitude at the end, and the meeting adjourned successfully.</p>
<h3>Three Aircraft Accidents - Three Prosecutors Conduct On-Site Investigation - Civilian Aircraft Have No Radar Equipment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the tragic accident involving three passenger planes, the District Procuratorate, in order to investigate the cause, dispatched three prosecutors, Cao Hong, Ji Su, and Wu Qihua, along with clerk Zhang Zhengping, translator Xu Shaoyong, and bailiff Wang Xingran, to Jiangwan Airport at 1:20 pm yesterday for an on-site investigation. Before departing, they first inquired at the US military headquarters about the radar equipment at Jiangwan Airport. The US military authorities informed them that the US Air Force in Shanghai did not have radar, and only the Second Service Group of the Chinese Air Force had two radar units at Jiangwan Airport. The three prosecutors then went to the Second Service Group of the Air Force to investigate the details of the plane crash and the use of radar at that time. According to Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Weihua of the group, due to the heavy fog that night, it was known that there were planes in the air that could not land. At that time, it was not known whether they were civilian or military aircraft. The Air Force used radar to try to guide them to land blindly, but it was ineffective because civilian aircraft have no radar equipment and have not received radar training, so it was impossible to establish contact with the ground. Lieutenant Colonel Zhang also said that the primary condition for flying is to pay attention to the weather, so he deeply regretted the plane crash. After bidding farewell to Lieutenant Colonel Zhang, the three prosecutors went to the crash site of passenger plane No. 48 in Zhanghuabang Zhangjiazhai. They saw that the destroyed nose of the plane was still in its original place, and there were dozens of soldiers digging for property nearby. The prosecutors personally witnessed one person picking up 40,000 yuan in legal tender. The three prosecutors were very indignant at this situation and believed that the airline's post-accident prevention was too negligent. The airline should be responsible for keeping and returning the deceased passengers' belongings, souvenirs, official documents, and all valuable items to the families of the victims and should not allow theft. The investigation returned after 7 pm. The three prosecutors planned to continue to Longhua Airport this morning for inspection.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the person in charge of the Central Aviation Transportation Corporation (CATC), the company's compensation method for the deceased passengers is still in accordance with the Ministry of Transportation's regulations. The compensation is one million yuan per person. Currently, only Mrs. Ni's family has received it.</p>
<h3>US Air Transport Command Commander - Discusses the Main Cause of the Plane Crash</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 30th, Rear Admiral Reeves, commander of the US Naval Air Transport Service, gave his opinion on the recent aviation tragedy in Shanghai, saying: "The main reason for the tragedy was that the pilots could not use the radar equipment. However, the use of radar is extremely simple, and even inexperienced pilots can do it. It is a pity that the crew members could not use it, resulting in the loss of innocent passengers' lives.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Shipping Personnel - Demand a Pay Raise - Will Strike if Their Goal is Not Achieved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The personnel of the UNRRA Shipping Detachment have recently submitted a request for a pay raise to the responsible authorities. If their goal cannot be achieved, they will begin a strike on January 2nd. There are 130 people in the detachment. They have submitted a request to General Edgerton, the head of the UNRRA office in Shanghai, requesting that their salaries be calculated in US dollars or British pounds and that they receive certain preferential treatment upon retirement.</p>
<p>UNRRA officials did not comment on this matter yesterday, saying only that UNRRA was responsible. An UNRRA spokesman also declined to comment on the matter yesterday.</p>
<p>In their petition to Mr. Edgerton, the Shipping Detachment personnel stated that the compensation they had received in the past three months was far less than what was stipulated in the original agreement. Their salaries are currently calculated at a rate of over 3,500 yuan per US dollar, and they have lost more than half of their value.</p>
<p>They said that the Shipping Detachment had made various empty promises to retired personnel, and in fact, most of them had not been fulfilled. In addition to protesting this time, they are also demanding full protection upon retirement in the future. If the Shipping Detachment still ignores this request, they have decided to strike starting at noon on January 2nd. The UNRRA Shipping Detachment currently has about 80 landing craft and other vessels. Most of the materials transported by UNRRA from Shanghai to various parts of the interior are handled by these ships.</p>

<h3>US Military Rape of Female Student - Shanghai Students Express Anger - Jinan and Other Schools Go on Strike</h3>

<h3>Director of Public Works Bureau Inspects Projects in Jiangwan and Other Districts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Director Zhao Zukang of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, accompanied by Zhu Guoxi, head of the Structural Engineering Department, Lu Jifang, head of the Road Department, Zhou Shutao, head of the First Engineering Department, and others, went to Jiangwan, Wusong, Dachang, and Zhenru districts yesterday morning to inspect difficult projects such as bridge repair, road construction, and river dredging.

The Public Works Bureau has now found a shortcut, that is, to go straight from Yixian Road in Jiangwan to the Yunzao Creek Bridge, which can shorten the entire journey by three kilometers. The bureau is currently paving asphalt and coal layers on the road surface, which will be completed by next spring and officially opened to traffic. Then, they went to the Yunzao Creek Bridge to inspect the bridge, which was repaired at the end of October and is specially prepared for the passage of ten-ton trucks.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] All representatives of the Taiwan Provincial National Assembly are scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Taiwan by plane today. The representatives hosted the Shanghai press and Taiwanese business community at the Red Cotton Restaurant at 3 pm yesterday. Representative Huang Guoshu reported during the banquet, saying: Taiwan is gradually entering modernization, which is not due to the Japanese but due to the accumulation of 51 years of hard work and blood and sweat of the Taiwanese people. The constitution formulated by the National Assembly this time can be called perfect. The Taiwanese people have eager expectations for constitutional rule and are willing to use the early implementation of constitutional rule in Taiwan as a test. Mr. Huang hopes that the people of the country will not have a "sense of difference" towards Taiwan due to the separation of time and space. The Taiwanese war criminals were driven by the Japanese, and the government and the people of the country should forgive them.

<p>Renhe Midwifery School's 30th Anniversary - Adding School Buildings and Launching a Fundraising Campaign</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The private Renhe Senior Midwifery Vocational School was founded by the famous doctor Ms. Zhang Xiangwen. The anniversary from the 6th year of the Republic of China to New Year's Day next year is the 30th anniversary of the school. Over the years, the school has had nearly a thousand graduates. About two hundred people serve in Shanghai, and the rest are distributed throughout the country. Currently, there are 117 midwifery students and 28 nursing students studying at the school. However, due to the insufficient school site attached to Renhe Hospital at No. 36 Moliai Road, it is impossible to expand the school. Ms. Zhang has donated a piece of vacant land purchased by her in front of the school to the school, planning to build a three-story building for classrooms. The construction fund will be launched for fundraising from New Year's Day, with a target of 150 million yuan, divided into 35 teams, with 70 team leaders and 280 team members, each team responsible for raising 4.5 million yuan. After the new school building is completed, Principal Zhang hopes to enroll 200 people first, and then expand according to the financial situation.</p>
<p>The midwifery program stipulates a three-year graduation period. Junior high school graduates can enroll. In the second year, they begin internships at Renhe and Shangxian Women and Children Hospitals. In the third year, they are assigned to various hospitals for internships. After graduation, they participate in the examination and become official midwives. Many of the graduates over the years are well-known doctors in society, such as Ms. Ni Feijun, the wife of He Yaozu, who graduated from the school in the 18th year of the Republic of China. During the internship, each student has at least 40 deliveries. The tuition fee is extremely low, only 160,000 yuan per semester, and there is a 28% free quota. The nursing program is three and a half years, with the first half year being completely free. The school currently has more than 30 faculty and staff members. The dean of academic affairs is Ms. Liu Jianqiu, the medical director of Renhe Hospital. Most of the teachers teach voluntarily. For example, Dean Liu's monthly salary is only 70,000 yuan. Ms. Zhang Xiangwen is a graduate of Shanghai Medical College and studied in the United States, graduating from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the New York Medical Institute in the 12th year of the Republic of China. In addition to founding a midwifery school, she also runs Renhe Hospital and Shangxian Women and Children Hospital. Renhe Hospital admitted a total of 1,848 patients this year, including 248 free patients and 231 people in the nursery. There are currently 80 hospital beds and 8 doctors. The hospital began to take in abandoned babies nine years ago, or if poor pregnant women are unable to raise their children after giving birth, the hospital can temporarily take care of them and return them to the pregnant women after they have recovered. The abandoned babies are then adopted by others, but among the 50 abandoned babies, only 2 are boys, and the rest are girls. Ms. Zhang serves the community to the best of her ability. Although the school building funds are limited, in addition to teaching hours, she also uses classrooms to run a public school, which enrolls 30 students with elementary school qualifications. Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to commend Ms. Zhang for her contributions to society and the country.</p>

<h3>The "Wolf" is Finally Tried Under Mercury Lamps - Mimura Shamelessly Denies Murder - Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Set for the Sixth of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Mimura Haruki, the former captain of the Kempeitai in Changshu, who was accused of tyranny and murder, was retried by Judge Lu Qi of the First Pacification Zone Military Court last Saturday. Yesterday afternoon at 3 pm, a collegial panel was convened again for the final adjudication. Presiding Judge Li Liang, Judges Lu Qi, Qu Zeceng, Zhang Shijie, and Li Qinhou, Prosecutor Tu Guangjun, Clerk Wang Shuliang, and the defendant's defense attorney Qian Longsheng attended. The two heads and several dry bones used as evidence were prominently displayed on the judge's bench. There were no empty seats in the audience, and the strong light of the mercury lamps of the Central Film Studio swept away the court's months-long silence.</p>
<p>Mimura was still wearing a grass-green military uniform coat and a water bottle. After entering the court, he took off his coat and water bottle. Presiding Judge Li first asked him his name and place of origin, and then asked if he had anything to say about the charges listed in the indictment. Mimura calmly took off his gloves and then took out a pre-written draft paper from his coat pocket and defended himself eloquently. The content of his defense was: (1) It is true that he arrested people in the Taicang Changre area in the 32nd year of the Republic of China and sent some of them to the 12th Army Military Law Office, but this was done under orders. (2) The indictment stated that 17 of the arrested people were sent to the Military Law Office, and the whereabouts of the remaining 5 were unknown. However, a total of 19 people were sent to the Military Law Office at that time, and the remaining 3 died of illness. (3) He denied having committed torture and abuse. If his subordinates had such behavior, he should only be subject to administrative punishment. (4) He asked the court not to believe the words of the victims' families and shamelessly claimed that the villagers in Changshu had said he was good during his four years there, but now they dare not say he is good, and rudely stated: "Chinese people are very good at lying."</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Li immediately questioned him on four key points: (1) Asked: What evidence is there that the so-called arrest of people was under orders from superiors? Answer: You can ask my superior, Lieutenant General Ueno. (2) Asked: Was the arrest of people suddenly ordered by superiors, or did the Kempeitai provide information first, and then the order was issued? Answer: The Kempeitai provided information first. (3) Asked: Before arresting people, did you demolish the Yang family's house and build four prison cells? Answer: Yes. (4) Asked: To whom were the bodies of the three people who allegedly died of illness handed over? Answer: To their families. There was a receipt at the time, but it has been lost. You can ask the families. The court immediately rebuked him, saying that the victims' families had never received the bodies, and ordered him to sign the record. Then, Gong Qiren, a Suzhou resident who had been unreasonably arrested by Mimura's subordinates Heno and others in the past, was called as a witness and recounted that he had been subjected to torture such as being drowned in water, trampled on six times, and hung.</p>
<p>The court then presented photos of the victims' bones that had been exhumed by personnel dispatched by the court outside the north gate of Changshu a month ago, and the translated transcripts of the testimony of Chen Yunzhou and Ye Lingzhen, former employees of Changshu County Hospital. Although Mimura was facing the heads and dry bones in the judge's seat, he showed no fear and still denied everything.</p>
<p>Finally, the prosecutor and the defendant's defense attorney stood up to make their arguments. Prosecutor Tu believed that the defendant was guilty of war crimes under the War Crimes Ordinance and the crime of abusing his authority to commit murder and torture under the criminal law and should be sentenced to death. The defense attorney argued that all the crimes were committed by Mimura's subordinates and that Mimura should not be held responsible and should be acquitted.</p>
<p>It was almost 6 pm. Presiding Judge Li declared the debate over, as the facts had already been clarified, and adjourned the hearing to pronounce the sentence at 2 pm on January 6th of the 36th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Wang Xunzhi, the First Defendant in the Grain Loan Case - Interrogated Yesterday - Due to an Inquiry from the Civil Service Disciplinary Committee - Learned That He Was the Director Who Was Involved in Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Xunzhi, the first defendant in the grain loan case, was the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. Last year, he was investigated by the Hangzhou District Procuratorate for suspected corruption and was not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. After the grain loan case occurred, Wang was also listed as a defendant. The Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee recently sent a letter to the Hangzhou District Procuratorate asking whether the two Wang Xunzhi were the same person. The Hangzhou District Procuratorate sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court inquiring about this matter. The letter stated: "This office is managing the case of Wang Xunzhi, former director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, in the 34th year of the Republic of China, No. 238, for corruption. The investigation has been completed and a decision has been made not to prosecute. Now, the Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee has sent a letter inquiring whether the defendant Wang Xunzhi in this case is the same as the defendant Wang Xunzhi in the grain loan fraud case accepted by your office. The defendant Wang Xunzhi in the corruption case accepted by this office was formerly the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and is currently residing at No. 105, Siming Village, Central Zhongzheng Road, Shanghai, B. Whether they are the same person, this office cannot guess. Accordingly, please investigate and reply as soon as possible." Therefore, Judge Wu Zhongzu of the District Court interrogated Wang Xunzhi again yesterday. Wang stated: He is 47 years old, from Zhejiang, the deputy general manager of Changjiang Industrial Company, residing at No. 55, Siming Village, and was the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and had also lived at No. 105, Siming Village. After the interrogation, he was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Water Rats Caught Stealing - Twelve People Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Patrol boats from the Harbor Affairs Committee's Inspection and Security Group discovered four boats filled with coal flowing south near Dongjiadu in Nanshi late the day before yesterday. Because their actions were suspicious, the group's supervisor Lu Zhizhong ordered them to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, one of the men on the boats pushed Lu into the water after he boarded the boat. Fortunately, the accompanying staff were alert and rescued Lu and then used guns to stop their actions. Finally, the criminals were caught. The four boats carried a total of about 15 tons of coal, worth 5 million yuan. The suspects, Wang Tonglin, Zhu Jinfa, Duan Yingui, and Zeng Wangshi, were taken back for interrogation. According to their confession, the coal was stolen from regular Shanghai-Ningbo line ships and planned to be transported to Pudong for sale. After the group obtained the confession, it has prepared a document and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for handling yesterday.</p>
<h3>Enforcing Strict Drug Prohibition and Imposing Severe Penalties: Drug Offenders Sentenced to Imprisonment Will Not Be Lightly Granted Remission – Reasons Stated in Court Ruling</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the victory, the government is determined to eradicate drug use in the short term, ordering drug users to register and quit within a deadline, and vigorously arresting drug offenders who continue to use drugs and sending them to court for prosecution. All those found guilty of drug use are sentenced to imprisonment. All defendants have broken their addiction after detoxification. Prosecutors have requested remission of their sentences on their behalf based on the security disposition of the Criminal Law. Apart from Yuan Meiyun and Xia Peizhen, there are a total of nineteen people including Wang Kequan, Shen Xiaomei, Shi Yuxiu, Cao Xiuying, Liu Shi, Chen Zimei, Fu Xiaomei, Zhao Jinbiao, Wang Jinshan, Ma Ziren, Li Dongshi, Li Li, Li Wenxing, Wang Chenying, Jin Zhangshi, Xie Lushi, Shen Mashi, Chen Yeye, and Wu Sanmei. However, all were rejected by the court. The reasons are generally the same. The full text of one ruling is published below:</p>
<p>"Defendant Wu Sanmei, female, age 43, from Guangdong, residing at 183 Hubei Road, in custody. The aforementioned defendant's sentence has been requested for remission by the prosecutor due to a drug case. The ruling is as follows:</p>
<h3>Ruling: The request is rejected.</h3>
<p>Reason: Upon reviewing the case file, the defendant was transferred to this court by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department on August 7 of this year for opium use. This court sentenced her to six months of imprisonment on August 12 of this year, with a two-month deadline for forced detoxification and addiction breaking. The judgment has been confirmed and is on file. During the execution of the sentence, the prosecutor, based on the forensic examination confirming the defendant's addiction breaking after forced detoxification, deemed that there was no need to execute the imprisonment and requested remission of the sentence. This court, according to Article 88 of the Criminal Law, stipulates that if the court believes there is no need to execute the sentence after the execution of the prohibition order, the sentence may be remitted. However, at a time when the government is strictly eradicating drug use, it is appropriate to impose severe penalties to warn ignorant drug users. It is inappropriate to invoke the aforementioned law and lightly grant remission. Furthermore, the original sentence was extremely light, and the term of imprisonment will soon expire, making remission of the sentence unnecessary. The request should be rejected in accordance with Article 485 of the Criminal Procedure Law, as stated in the main text."</p>
<h3>Murdering Child and Suicide: Another Example of the Harm Caused by Drug Use</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wang Shuren, who currently works in the Shenyang Municipal Government, has a wife named Wang Chun, 39 years old, a local. She has a long-standing addiction. In March of this year, her husband Wang Shuren provided funds for her to bring one of their children to Shanghai to quit opium, temporarily residing with her mother. Unexpectedly, she lacked the courage and continued to indulge in opium day and night, leading to financial difficulties. She once borrowed 350,000 legal tender from Ding Guitang of the Jianghai Customs Bureau due to family relations. However, the money was quickly used up. Yesterday at around 2 PM, she poisoned her child with a heavy dose of poisonous liquid, and also swallowed poison herself. She then brought the child to her cousin Cheng Zhiqin (at 150 Lane 13, Jiashen Road). After speaking for a few words, Cheng noticed her pale complexion and incoherent speech and quickly hired a car to accompany her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, her child died soon after due to excessive poisoning. Although the woman received careful diagnosis from the doctors, she had not been removed from danger by midnight.</p>
<h3>Two Cloth Stores Robbed in Pingliang Road: Eighteen Robbers Armed with New Military Weapons; Sentries Posted at Intersections, Police Officers Disarmed</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Wandaxiang Cotton Store at 2587-2589 Pingliang Road in Pudong, and the neighboring Baochang Cotton and Cloth Store at 2601-2603, were suddenly attacked by eighteen robbers at around 1:50 AM yesterday. They wore different clothing and were all armed with new military weapons such as submachine guns, Mauser pistols, and handguns. After arriving, they posted sentries at key intersections around the area. A group of robbers then knocked on the door and entered, first confining more than twenty employees and apprentices from both stores in the pavilion of the Baochang store. At that time, two nearby police officers (numbers 1422 and 1295) rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm but were disarmed by the robbers and ordered not to move. The remaining robbers divided up and looted, taking half an hour to leave after plundering. Before leaving, they injured the head of Chen Baoyi, the owner of Baochang store, with the butt of a gun, causing bleeding. They then escaped with their loot. It was found that the losses of the two cotton and cloth stores were as follows: Baochang store lost 8.5 million legal tender in cash and over 11 million legal tender in cloth, while Wandaxiang lost 5 million legal tender in cloth and 230,000 legal tender in cash.</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the Land Administration Advisory Committee: Rental Standard Issues - Six Principles Formulated; Discussion on the Expropriation of the Hardoon Garden and Racecourse</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, considering the complex land situation in the city due to the mixed Chinese and foreign population, established the Land Administration Advisory Committee by a decision made at the Municipal Government Meeting, in order to ensure that land administration facilities are in line with local realities, to pool wisdom, and to solve major land administration issues. Social figures and experts familiar with the city's land situation were appointed as members. The committee held its first meeting at 3 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Hall. More than twenty people attended, including Mayor Wu, Director Zhu, and advisory committee members Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, Xu Yongzuo, Shu Shuxiong, and Lu Shidao. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu first reported that the Municipal Government hoped that municipal facilities would be closer to public opinion. Although the city already had a Municipal Council, which met once every three months to discuss extremely important issues, not all councilors were researchers of land issues. Therefore, the Land Administration Advisory Committee was established to study major issues for the government's reference. There were three issues for discussion today: (1) The issue of rental standards, which is a major and difficult issue. (2) The issue of the racecourse. The prerequisite for this issue is whether the issuance of lottery tickets for horse racing constitutes gambling. It is heard that the council has received an interpretation order from the central government stating that the issuance of lottery tickets without government approval constitutes gambling. Therefore, there is still a difficulty in the discussion. I have discussed with the chairman, Van Kerckem, suggesting exchanging suburban land for the current racecourse to be used as the council's headquarters and a park. Van Kerckem raised two points: (1) the issue of suburban transportation, and (2) the issue of land prices at the time of expropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Hardoon Garden issue, I have negotiated with Mr. Raidt, the agent of Hardoon's estate. This issue involves Hardoon's nationality, and whether Hardoon was British is questionable, possibly under the jurisdiction of the Chinese court. The will also states that a portion of his property should be donated to the Municipal Government, a portion to the Chinese Central Government, and the rest donated to charity. I have asked Mr. Raidt to lease the garden to the Municipal Government as a park, using the land tax payment as rent, but there have been no results.</p>
<p>After that, Director Shen Zhu reported on the land tax, with collected taxes reaching 2.5 billion, and it is expected that 3.6 billion can be collected next year, with a budget of 12 billion for next year. Then the rental standard issue was discussed. Xu Shihao, Xu Yongzuo, Li Shuxiong, Zhu Fuyou, Li Wenjie, Wang Xianqing, and others expressed their opinions on legal and factual matters. Director Zhu then summarized the opinions of all parties, taking into account the principles of economic fairness and social policy, and formulated six principles. He also appointed Zhu Ping, Xu Shihao, Ma Shaoquan, Li Wenjie, Ma Junshuo, Wang Xianqing, and Li Shuxiong to form a subcommittee to study concrete measures and provide them to the council for reference. (1) The current status should be maintained for those whose pre-war rental amount is below a certain level. (2) The principle of maintaining the current status should still be applied for those exceeding a certain amount. If an increase is required, it should be done through agreement. If there is a dispute, the district mediation committee may be requested to mediate. (3) The total rent received by those who sublet a portion of the house to others should not exceed the rent they should pay themselves. (4) Rent should not be calculated in foreign currency. Those originally rented in foreign currency should be converted to legal tender, and thereafter, the legal tender amount shall prevail. (5) Actively promote measures to encourage housing construction. (6) Request national banks to open construction loans.</p>
<p>The principles for the Hardoon Garden are: (1) Expropriation in accordance with the law. (2) The estate dispute should be promptly tried by the court. (3) The portion of Hardoon's estate designated for donation to the government and public welfare should be investigated and taken over by the Land Administration Bureau first.</p>
<p>Regarding the racecourse issue, the principle is: (1) Expropriate in accordance with the law or have the Municipal Government designate comparable land in the suburbs for exchange. All of the above principles were handed over to the subcommittee to study concrete measures.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zengjue's Response to the Council: Maintaining Electricity Conservation is Still Necessary</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works, Health, and Regulations committees of the Municipal Council held meetings separately at 3 PM yesterday. The details are as follows: The sixth meeting of the Public Works Committee was attended by twelve councilors, chaired by Xu Xueyu. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Works Bureau, also attended and reported on the reasons why electricity conservation measures must be maintained, stating briefly: (1) The electricity conservation measures are temporary in nature, for a period of four months, starting in November, so it is impossible to check the number of residents or sub-use households one by one. (2) According to the historical records of lighting electricity consumption, there is an increase of 20% to 25% in winter. This year, the increase is only 13.1%. (3) A review of the 160,000 lighting households in the city shows that half of them are below 20 degrees. If each household uses half a degree more per day, then a total of 40,000 degrees more is needed. Based on an average of three hours of lighting per day, approximately 13,000 degrees can be saved per day. (4) Regarding industrial electricity consumption, it was 45 million degrees in October this year, and increased to 50 million degrees after electricity conservation in November. (5) The generators of all factories have now been developed as much as possible, and the bureau is also urging an increase in power generation. Once the power supply increases, the electricity conservation measures can be gradually lifted by district.</p>
<p>The committee then discussed the proposal submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau to the Council for review of the draft provisional rules for the Shanghai civil shipping and lighterage industry. Resolution: Amended and passed to the Regulations Committee for review. (2) According to the application from the Tricycle Rental Industry Association for the issuance of licenses to maintain business. Resolution: Sent to the Public Works Bureau for consideration.</p>
<p>Health Committee: The sixth meeting of the workers discussed four proposals: (1) The proposal from the Municipal Government regarding the over-collection of the mobilized epidemic prevention fee by the Epidemic Prevention Committee, submitting detailed reasons and work plans for review, and asking how to handle it. Resolution: It was originally agreed to spend the over-collection part of the epidemic prevention fee. (2) The notice from the Secretariat that part of the Hongkou Road Elementary School building is occupied by the Health Bureau, requesting the Health Bureau to vacate it. Resolution: A letter to the Health Bureau to review the files of Hongkou Road Elementary School and then investigate the facts for discussion at the next meeting. (3) The application from the Shanghai Funeral Coffin Transportation Industry Association, stating the difficulties in clearing accumulated coffins as ordered and the reasons for the inconvenience of cremation, requesting the Municipal Government to adopt it. Resolution: Forwarded to the Municipal Government for consideration. (4) Three items, including the rules for managing barbershops, the draft rules for managing private workshops, and the draft rules for managing fresh pork stalls, should be reviewed. Resolution: First hand them over to Councilors Chen Cunren and Cen Zhiliang for review, and then submit them for discussion.</p>
<p>Regulations Committee: The Regulations Committee also amended and passed the following cases in the seventh meeting: (1) The implementation measures for the 35th year of conscription investigation, (2) Shanghai Municipal Management of Electrical Materials Stores, (3) Implementation measures for the collection of land tax in kind at a discounted national currency, (4) Provisional rules for the Police Bureau's management of bars, cafes, and dancing girls. The following were considered to be of great importance and should be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion: (1) Shanghai Municipal Compensation Standards for Demolishing Houses for Road Construction, (2) Implementation measures for promoting the "25%" rent reduction, (5) Shanghai Municipal Rules for Managing Factory Addresses, and (4) Shanghai Municipal Penalties for Late Payment of Land Tax.</p>
<h3>Another 120 Public Buses in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Public Transportation Company, under the Public Works Bureau, previously purchased 120 "Dodge" trucks from the Materials Supply Bureau. It is reported that 20 of them will be fitted with wooden bodies and added to the existing lines. The remaining 100 will be fitted with aluminum bodies, which are wider than the existing ones. The company currently operates 130 public buses, but 10 of them are old and will be retired. Adding the newly purchased 120, there will be 240 buses next year. If circumstances permit, the company plans to purchase formal public buses instead of modifying "Dodge" trucks. By the end of next year, there may be 300 public buses.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau will pay special attention to developing public transportation in the urban area and will pay more attention to the Nanshi area. The suburban areas will be assigned to commercial operation.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Deposit Repayment Issue: Second Instance Judgment by the High Court - 800 Times for Fixed Deposits, 500 Times for Regular Savings</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The issue of pre-war debt and bank deposit repayment has repeatedly led to litigation. The judgments of the Shanghai District Court were all based on a standard of 1,000 times. After the parties appealed to the High Court, the High Court, unwilling to create a precedent, advised on attempted reconciliation in each appeal case. However, the original defendants mostly insisted on their claims, making reconciliation extremely difficult. The High Court then delivered judgments in two cases yesterday morning: Fixed deposits from 1940 were changed to be repaid at 800 times. Regular savings deposits from 1938 were changed to be repaid at 500 times. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Citizen Chen Jilin deposited 2,000 legal tender into the Four Banks Savings Association on May 6, 1940, for a fixed term of five years, which expired on May 6 of last year. Chen requested the court to order a payment increased by 3,000 times in accordance with Article 12 of the Civil Procedure Supplementary Regulations and the Judicial Yuan's interpretation No. 3018 after his return to Shanghai. The District Court ruled that the defendant, the Four Banks Savings Association, should increase the payment by 1,000 times. The Four Banks Savings Association was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. The second instance judgment was announced yesterday morning, overturning the original judgment and changing the payment to be increased by 800 times. (2) The appellant, Juxingcheng Bank, because the plaintiffs Lu Yu and Lu Kun had special regular savings deposits from September 28, 1938, and December 14 of the same year, with Lu Yu accumulating 2,311.43 yuan and Lu Kun accumulating 2,185.03 yuan, both for a fixed term of five years, expiring in May 1942. In August of this year, the Lu brothers filed a lawsuit requesting repayment at 1,000 times. The District Court ruled that the repayment should be calculated at 800 times. Juxingcheng was dissatisfied and appealed. The second instance judgment was announced by the High Court yesterday morning, overturning the original judgment and changing the payment to be calculated at 500 times.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Public Reporting of Traitors Expires Today; High Court Has Not Yet Received Formal Order</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the issue of the deadline for reporting traitors, a person in charge of the High Court said yesterday that the court had not yet received a formal order. However, the National Government issued an instruction on the 13th of this month, the content of which stated: "Regarding the periodic reporting of traitors, it has been decided at the 211th Standing Committee meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council that the deadline for the reporting of traitor cases during the Anti-Japanese War by the people or organizations is December 31, 1946. Reports made after the deadline will not be considered by the prosecutor. However, the state's right of prosecution and the victim's right of complaint will not be affected." In this regard, the scope of reporting traitors has been narrowed to eliminate the abuse of malicious accusations. However, the work of reporting traitors has not ended as a result.</p>
<h3>Trial of Zhu Jin Yu and Son</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhu Jin Yu and his son Zhu Guo Shan were charged with suspicion of being traitors. The trial opened yesterday afternoon.

After the court hearing, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned, Zhu Jin Yu was returned to custody, and Zhu Guo Shan was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Jiang Shang Da Case - Supplementary Interrogation of Witnesses</h3>

Witnesses Wu Kunsheng, manager of the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and Huang Renzhi, etc., were summoned yesterday morning to testify. The testimonies were all favorable to the defendant, stating that Jiang Shang Da was arrested and detained by the enemy for three months for opposing the enemy's purchase of yarn and cloth. The defendant was not summoned yesterday. The court announced that the hearing would be continued at a later date.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Interrogation of Film Actors - Rescheduled for Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The fourth batch of nine film and drama actors who were summoned for being affiliated with the enemy, including Zhang Shankun, Chen Yunshang, and Mei Xi, etc., were originally scheduled to be interrogated at the High Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday morning. However, the prosecutor in charge of the case, Qu Rong, was attending to a case at the Tilanqiao Special Criminal Court, so the interrogation was rescheduled for this morning. According to related sources, Zhang Shankun and others are still hiding in Hong Kong, and it is feared that not all of the nine people will be able to appear in court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Trial of Supervisor Li Hongfei</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Li Hongfei was tried at the High Court yesterday afternoon. The defendant, 59 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, wore a blue silk robe, silver-rimmed glasses, and had a ruddy complexion. He claimed to have more than 20 years of experience in the salt industry. During the Anti-Japanese War, he had bid to transport 1 million dan of Huai salt to the Salt Administration Bureau in the name of Xieji Salt Company. However, due to the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, the bureau moved west, and only over 40,000 dan were transported to Hankou. In the winter of 1939, he planned to use foreign ships to transport a large amount of Huai salt to supply the people of Hunan and Hubei. However, correspondence with the Salt Administration Bureau was seized by the enemy, and he was arrested by the Japanese military police on the second day of the first month of the lunar calendar in 1940, and was detained for 63 days. He was released on bail through Zhou Fohai. Zhou had twice advised him to take a false position, once as the head of the false Salt Administration and once as the false Minister of Industry, but he refused both times. In March 1943, he became the chairman of the false Central China Salt Industry Company, in charge of salt transportation. He transported Haizhou salt to Xuzhou, Bengbu, Nanjing, Shanghai and other areas, but claimed that it was all for the people's food. The false company was established during the Restoration Government era, with 50% of the shares held by the enemy and 40% forcibly held by the false government. Merchants held only a weak 10%. There was also the export of industrial salt for the enemy's use. After he became the false chairman, he reduced the export quantity. After the reorganization into the false China Salt Industry Company in November 1943, the supply was stopped, and the enemy shares were also withdrawn. The core of his defense was two points: (1) The false company was only responsible for transportation and did not have food itself. (2) During his tenure as the director, he did not send ships to transport industrial salt to Japan. The Japanese sent their own ships to transport it. After the defendant's defense lawyer stood up to defend, the court announced that the hearing would be adjourned, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Fourth Round, Fourth Allotment of Yarn - Spinning Control Committee Revises New Prices - 20-Count Yarn Priced at 1.975 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The Spinning Control Committee convened a yarn price review committee at the City Government Conference Room at 4 PM yesterday. Chairman Wu, Shu Yunzhang, and Wang Qizi attended, along with Li Shengbo, Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Ye Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, Director of the Spinning Control Committee's Business Department. After much discussion, a new price was finally determined for the fourth round, fourth allotment of yarn, i.e., the newly negotiated price for 20-count yarn is 1.97 million yuan per piece. The prices of other grades of yarn are calculated proportionally. In addition, the fourth round, fourth allotment of recycled yarn will be entirely approved on January 6th.</p>
<p>The new prices assessed yesterday are the selling prices for the fourth round, fourth allotment of yarn, which already include the consolidated tax and 20% profit. As for the purchase price by the Central Government, it still awaits approval from President Song. It is said that a draft has been prepared at yesterday's meeting for President Song's reference, and those who attended said that the differences are minor.</p>
<p>The accounting items for calculating the cost of cotton yarn were also decided at yesterday's meeting, and it was stipulated that regardless of whether it is state-owned or privately-owned, all should be calculated based on the following items: (1) Raw materials. (2) Wages. (3) Manufacturing costs: including (A) materials and fuel, (B) depreciation, (C) employee benefits, (D) power costs, (E) staff salaries and allowances, (F) repair costs: including machine repairs and building repairs, (G) other. (4) Financial costs (interest). (5) Business expenses (i.e., management fees, such as the expenses of the Spinning and Construction Company's management office, etc.).</p>
<p>The issue of cotton prices was also discussed at yesterday's meeting, but opinions differed. In the newly determined prices, the cotton price is calculated at 250,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), with each piece using 3.5 dan. The consolidated tax is 94,000 yuan, calculated at 6%.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Stagnant, Gold Prices Rise - Hong Kong Remittances Have Plenty of Supply from Guangdong Banks</h3>
<p>Yellow gold was extremely stable yesterday. When the market opened in the morning, the price rose to 3.38 million to 3.4 million yuan due to news reports with slightly favorable buying arguments. As soon as the Central Bank offered to sell, the market price immediately fell. With no support in the middle, the low price dropped to 3.24 million yuan, and there was real sales support. The Central Bank allocated 90 bars at a price of 3.28 million yuan. Afterwards, the price rose back to 3.37 million yuan, and the market turned idle. There was a slight fluctuation between 3.3 million and 3.35 million yuan. At noon, news suddenly came that the Central Bank's trade intentions had stopped, and the price rose to around 3.377 million yuan. The afternoon started stable but then weakened, falling from 3.39 million to around 3.34 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry was quoted at 356,000 yuan, silver dollars were flat, and underground interest rates remained between 15% and 18%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were flat for the US dollar and weak for Hong Kong yesterday. The black market price of US dollars started at 6,100 to 6,300 yuan in the morning, and then hovered between 6,200 and 6,400 yuan. Transactions were even rarer in the afternoon, and the market was stagnant. As a result, there was little change compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar was weak because Guangdong banks continued to supply. Although the Velvet Line Bank accepted it, it was unable to boost the price. The Shanghai telegraphic transfer rate rose to 81.5 yuan, and then fell below 1,200 yuan, a further drop of about 50 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 121 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,470 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,300 yuan. Only Hong Kong exchange rate had some volume of transactions.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Steady</h3>
<p>Government bonds were even more stable yesterday, with a turnover of just over one million yuan. Unified Category C opened at 1,450 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 1,480 yuan and a low price of 1,400 yuan. At noon, it hovered above 1,450 yuan, a slight decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Categories A and B were still flat, Category D fell by 110 yuan, and Category E fell by 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Authorities Will Send Personnel to Investigate Financial Institutions - Illegal Operations Will Be Severely Investigated</h3>
<p>According to news from the city's financial industry this morning, most of the year-end accounting for the second half of the year has been completed. The highest financial authorities attach great importance to the past operations of the industry and will send personnel to Shanghai to conduct spot checks. It is reported that the authorities' intention to inspect (the operation of financial institutions) is based on the fact that the speculative atmosphere in Shanghai's financial industry was strong in the past and could lead to instability. In order to prevent future crises, those found to have engaged in illegal operations will be severely investigated.</p>
<h3>Individual Sales of Foreign Exchange Must Be Approved by the Central Bank</h3>
<p>A reporter recently learned from the Foreign Exchange Examination Office that the office recently notified designated foreign exchange banks that henceforth, individual sales of foreign exchange must first be approved by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market Stable - This Year's Trade Was Average</h3>
<p>The supply of tung oil in the spot market is limited, and it is the end of the year, so transactions have come to a standstill, and the market has not changed. Looking back at the tung oil business in this city, there were no special profits this year, nor were there any bankruptcies due to losses. Most of the tung oil merchants in this city have a long history and strong capital, so they can barely maintain even in the economic downturn. Tung oil is one of China's main export products. At the beginning of the year, the price of tung oil was 70,000 national yuan per dan. By the end of the year, the price was 150,000 yuan, only doubling in price. Compared with other commodities, the difference is quite large. The biggest reason is the limited export prices. From January to May of this year, the amount of tung oil transported from the producing areas to Shanghai for export was not very large, but it continued to arrive. After June, the prices in the producing areas were as high as the export prices in Shanghai, and transportation was difficult, so the amount of goods arriving was small, and operations were also difficult. Later, due to high interest rates and rising freight rates, tung oil transportation became a losing proposition. For example, the freight rate for transporting tung oil from Chongqing to Shanghai was 30,000 yuan per dan in July and August, ten times the freight rate from Shanghai to New York. The transportation of tung oil from the producing areas relies entirely on manual labor, and land transportation costs are difficult to bear. Even if some waterways can be used, there is a shortage of boats, making transportation difficult. After the second foreign exchange adjustment, the price of tung oil in the producing areas rose more sharply than in Shanghai. By October, due to the attraction of the export ports in South China, tung oil from Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan was transported to South China. There was no arrival of goods in Shanghai, and transactions were extremely dismal.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Industry Inventories</h3>
<p>Yesterday was New Year's Eve in the Western calendar. There were no wholesale transactions of woolen fabrics, and even retail transactions were very quiet. Most stores were checking inventories and calculating accounts in order to conclude the year. It is said that the woolen fabric industry has suffered from heavy losses, high interest rates, and large public and private expenses this year. The inventories of all stores have decreased, and few have made a profit. Most are fortunate to be able to survive the Lunar New Year. There have been many closures and mergers.</p>
<h3>Production Loans - Temporary Review Committee - Considers Relaxing Standards - Few Commercial Banks Participate</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Temporary Review Committee for Production Special Loans of the Fourth War Zone Headquarters convened its seventh routine meeting at 1 PM yesterday. More than 20 committee members and experts attended, and Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Financial Decision and the Four Banks Joint Office, also attended. Chairman Huo presided over the meeting. Four proposals were discussed: (1) Continue to approve five loans, totaling more than 1 billion yuan. (2) The review criteria for supporting banks and financial institutions are different, with varying degrees of leniency. It was decided to appoint three experts to formulate fair and consistent standards, which will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. (3) In addition to adhering to the various regulations that have been promulgated, the loan procedures will also be relaxed. The detailed measures are still being studied by experts. (4) In order to regularly assess the loan situation after the fact, it is urgent to establish an audit office. Each unit of the China National Bank and Bureau will send two representatives, commercial banks will send three representatives, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office will send three representatives to form it. The Central Bank will send a person to serve as the chief auditor and regularly perform audit duties. The meeting adjourned at around 3 PM.</p>
<p>The reporter then interviewed people from all walks of life to solicit opinions on production loans. Some commercial financial institutions believe that two batches of production loans have been approved, totaling more than 2 billion yuan, but most of them are supported by the China National Bank and Bureau, and the Central Bank rediscounts them. Very few commercial financial institutions undertake it. Summarizing Zhang's views, there are no more than three points: (1) The interest rate on loans from various financial institutions is 4%, and the rediscount rate from the Central Bank is 2%. After rediscounting, the Central Bank bears 80% of the funds, and the lending financial institution bears 20%. After conversion, the interest earned by the lending financial institution is 1.2%. However, the current interest income from self-operated loans from various financial institutions is actually more favorable than this. (2) After the lending financial institution rediscounts with the Central Bank, it shares the funds with the Central Bank by 20-80, but in reality, it must bear the full responsibility for the loan. The current Banking Association has sent a letter to the Production Loan Association requesting clarification on this liability issue. (3) For each loan granted by a lending financial institution, at least 20% of the loan funds must be filled in. If loans continue to be granted, the lending financial institution's own funds may be insufficient, so there is an invisible restriction that it cannot lend as much as possible.</p>
<p>The industrial and commercial sectors believe that the current production loans still target raw materials and finished products as collateral. As for machinery and factory buildings, the valuation method has not been determined, so they cannot actually be used as collateral, and the regulations stipulate that the lending financial institution must send personnel to supervise the loan factory. If there is considerable profit, there are also regulations for mutual distribution according to this example, which is especially unaccustomed to the general industrial and commercial circles. Also, a certain cigarette factory applied for a loan, but it was deemed a luxury industry and rejected.</p>
<h3>December Fuel Management Committee - Allots Industrial Coal - Over 19,000 Tons</h3>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee is currently purchasing a large amount of coal from coal-producing areas and transporting it to Shanghai in succession in order to solve the city's coal shortage as much as possible. In order to eliminate coal shortages and hoarding by merchants, the committee allocates coal to the Coal Business Association for unified supply to various coal merchants for sale. The coal used by private factories is also allocated by the committee on a monthly basis. On the one hand, the Coal Business Association organizes a management office to allocate coal to private factories, which is responsible for registration and transportation. Personnel are dispatched to supervise and escort the coal to the factory in batches during each allocation to prevent fraud. It is learned that the committee allocated coal to 24 private factories in December, and the quantity for each industry is as follows: Machinery and cotton textile industry 3,400 tons, paper industry 850 tons, nut and bolt industry 400 tons, machine dyeing and weaving industry 5,859 tons, rubber products industry 1,308 tons, match industry 171 tons, flavoring powder industry 465 tons, soap and candle industry 436 tons, cigarette industry 1,148 tons, wool and velvet spinning, weaving and dyeing industry 706 tons, underwear weaving industry 285 tons, chemical raw materials industry 626 tons, thermos bottle industry 471 tons, machinery industry 211 tons, leather industry 60 tons, glass industry 870 tons, noodle food industry 212 tons, oil extraction industry 408 tons, silk cloth dyeing merchant Sang 316 tons, oil and fat industry 103 tons, grass knit hat industry 307 tons, knitting industry 156 tons, pharmaceutical industry 374 tons, and textile industry in the sixth district 250 tons, totaling 19,392 tons.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm, Oil Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 shi of rice arrived from the north and south. Buyers were unwilling to sell quickly, and Nabu were not willing to buy due to tight credit conditions. As a result, early rice in the southern market was stable in the morning but weak in the afternoon, and the northern market was weak first and then stable. High-quality northern japonica rice was still firm, while middle and lower-quality southern japonica rice fell by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. The supply and demand of indica rice were both small, and there was no change. Baiyuan fell by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the large number of middle and low-quality goods. Yinyuan goods poured in, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat was scarce and firm, flour supply and demand were balanced, bran turned firm, and rose by 100 to 200 yuan. The supply of tung oil from various sources continued in the oil market, but the offtake was flat, and continued to weaken by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan to 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The supply of medium-grade soybean oil in barrels was also large, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. However, the offtake of high-grade soybean oil and crude tung oil in baskets continued to be stable. Clear oil and sesame oil lacked fluctuations, rapeseed oil softened and lacked vitality. The oil market situation was still fluctuating in a flat and weak state. Soybean cake and oil residue were still being handled, and the price was steadily increasing by 100 to 200 yuan. Corn rose steadily, broad beans were mediocre, red beans were still scarce and unchanged, yellow beans were still being sold in small quantities, oil mills were selectively buying them, the offtake was flat, and the price rose slightly by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame was widely sold in Guangdong, and high-quality goods were in demand and actively transacted, with high-quality goods increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium-quality goods were flat. Peanut kernels were continuously sold in Guangdong and were also actively transacted in this area, and the price steadily increased, rising by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn - Yesterday the yarn market was generally flat and finely traded. 20-count yarn was slightly firmer than last weekend. 32-count fine yarn continued to be purchased by Guangdong merchants, rising by 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. Weaving factories absorbed 42-count double-ply yarn, also jumping by 100,000 yuan. 20-count yarn was unable to rise due to a larger supply and weak sales, and it remained mediocre.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains and Cloth Shipped to Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] China Merchants Bureau's Hai Zhe and Hai Zhou ships sailed to Taiwan one after another. Hai Zhe loaded more than 5,440 bags of peanut kernels, more than 1,140 pieces of cotton yarn, and more than 870 pieces of cloth, all transported to Keelung. Hai Zhou loaded 820 bags of beans, 2,900 pieces of soybean cake, more than 220 pieces of cloth, and 28 pieces of cotton yarn, as well as more than 1,000 pieces of groceries, transported to Keelung, and 5,600 pieces of soybean cake transported to Kaohsiung.</p>
<h3>Silk Trade Quiet</h3>
<p>The silk market has been declining continuously. Yesterday the market was still stable. There was not much change in rayon compared to Saturday. Factory silk quotes were slightly firmer, but transactions were very rare. Only 5 dan of high-quality new E-grade goods were transacted yesterday, priced at 4.65 million yuan. There were no other transactions. Silk fabrics and quilt covers fell sharply. Da Cheng quilt covers were sold off in large quantities in the market, resulting in the lowest price of 2.55 million yuan, and there were no buyers. Huazhong crepe sold for 3.5 million yuan, while secondary-quality goods sold for only 450,000 yuan, which was due to extremely tight credit conditions and buyers were unable to buy.</p>
<h3>Sausage Casings Nearly 4 Million Yuan per Barrel - Foreign Factory Manipulation Should Be Stopped Urgently</h3>
<p>It is learned that the recent selling price of sausage casings in New York is still 80 cents per piece. Although the Swiss franc exchange rate is higher, the selling price can earn 3.6 to 3.7 million yuan per barrel, but it is still very different from the current cost calculation in Shanghai. The cost calculation table of the industry association is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Raw material purchase price: 2,500 pieces of net sausage casings, of which 20% are fresh goods, calculated at 1,400 yuan per piece for 500 pieces, totaling 700,000 yuan, and 80% are customer goods, calculated at 1,275 yuan per piece for 2,000 pieces, totaling 2,550,000 yuan.</p>
<p>600 jin of salt are used per barrel, calculated at 345 yuan per jin, totaling 207,000 yuan. Wooden barrels, including white wax, cost 30,000 yuan. Barrel lining cloth and sewing cost 10,000 yuan. Water, electricity, rent, house donation, business tax, etc. cost 70,000 yuan. Trucking raw materials into the factory and shipping net goods out of the factory costs 16,000 yuan. Labor (an average of 15 workers are employed in the factory, including one foreman, three measurers, seven water pourers, and four assistants. At least 30 barrels of net goods can be produced per month) costs 319,000 yuan. The total cost per barrel is 3,902,000 yuan. The above costs do not include silver money interest, manager, accountant, and other office staff expenses. Therefore, before the international market price improves, it is still extremely difficult to export. People in the industry hope that the government will take action against a certain foreign sausage factory in the industry that deliberately raises the purchase price of raw materials (fresh intestines), order it to join the association, so as to avoid manipulation from it.</p>
<h3>Economic Downturn - More Than 20 Fish Shops Go Bankrupt</h3>
<p>There are more than 70 fish shops in this city, all located in the Bund and the 16th Pier area. According to people in the industry, the industry was quite developed before the war. Currently, due to the crisis in industry and commerce, more than 20 shops have gone bankrupt in the past month. The reasons for this are: (1) The funds of the shops are short, with a maximum of no more than 100 million yuan, and usually 20 million to 50 million yuan, so they often have poor turnover and are subject to high-interest loans, leading to bankruptcy. (2) The fish transported from other ports by the shops in this city must be subject to a 0.4% commission by the fish market, so development is limited. (3) The industry previously received a government loan of 100 million yuan, but only the fish market and boat owners benefited, and the transportation industry received little benefit, so financial difficulties are still unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday sugar prices were flat first and then rose. The trade association quoted the spot price of medium sugar at 141,000 yuan at the beginning of the market, then rose to 3,000 yuan, and later to 144,000 to 4,500 yuan. The price of Zhanju was 115,000 to 8,000 yuan, Shantou green opened at 115,000 yuan, and Gaoshunde green opened at 115,000 yuan. 300 to 400 bags were traded, all with customs clearance payment, so prices increased. Mian Chi was 152,000 to 3,000 yuan, 50 bags, Xinghua white was 158,000 to 6,000 yuan, and Xing Chi was 142,000 to 4,500 yuan, with more than 200 bags traded.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Still Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British company Renji Foreign Company had a small appetite for high-quality aged Qimen tea, but sellers were still hoarding it because of the scarcity of goods, so the market remained quiet. Other types of tea, such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, have been selling well recently, and prices are quite stable. As for aged pearl tea, the inventory has been exhausted. The process of other teas is mostly similar to last week.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Sends Letter to Jiangsu Provincial Government - Strictly Prohibit Hoarding and Profiteering</h3>
<p>[Joint Anhui and Shaanxi News Agency] It is learned that because Jiangsu Province was located in occupied territory, the measures for cracking down on hoarding and profiteering of important daily necessities were not implemented during the extraordinary period. Although the war is over, prices are still fluctuating. Non-business operators and non-industry merchants, or industry merchants, may still be hoarding and profiteering of important daily necessities, so they should still be severely cracked down on in accordance with the law, and regulations for rewarding tip-offs should be stipulated to encourage reporting. The types and names of important daily necessities that should be cracked down on for hoarding are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Grains: Rice, grain, flour, sorghum, millet, corn, beans.</p>
<p>(2) Clothing: Cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth (various native cotton cloths, various bleached, dyed, or printed cotton cloths), linen (various native linen cloths, various bleached, dyed, or printed linen cloths), leather.</p>
<p>(3) Fuels: Coal (coal blocks, coal powder, coal balls, coke coal), charcoal.</p>
<p>(4) Daily necessities: Salt, paper, soap, matches, tea seeds, rapeseed oil, pigments (including dyes), peanut oil, sesame oil, and other seeds.</p>
<p>(5) Other items designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs with approval. It is heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to instruct counties and cities to investigate and handle it.</p>
<h3>Financial News - Datong Bank</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the pressure of the year-end season and the impact of the industrial and commercial downturn, there has been slight volatility in the local banking industry. A reporter investigated from various sources. According to the records of the Bills Exchange, Datong Bank at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road and Zhenghe Bank on Nanjing Road still have a surplus after balancing their daily clearing positions. According to the person in charge of Datong Bank, the bank's business has always been conducted properly and has never engaged in speculative activities, and its reserve position is very sufficient.</p>
<p>Construction Bank - The Shanghai branch of the Construction Bank announced a temporary suspension of clearing on the 26th of this month. Yesterday morning (the 30th) it resumed business. It is heard that the bank's turnover problem this time was due to the failure of its investment in Taiwan sugar business, and it had ordered a huge amount of 1,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Speculators' Usual Trick - Fake Telegrams Appear Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, someone in this area fabricated a telegram draft from the United Press and sent it to various newspapers in an attempt to disrupt the financial market. This fake telegram claimed to be from Saigon and said that terrorists had seized all banks and transportation in Vietnam and that this action was obviously instigated by Moscow. The telegram paper was the same as that used by the United Press and was sent together with three other telegrams from Warsaw and Washington to various newspapers. However, four Chinese newspapers noticed loopholes in the way the draft was sent and saw through the deception. The United Press received a notice in time, announced that it was forged, and prevented publication. It was then found that this was a planned campaign to force sellers to sell Vietnamese currency in order to profit from it. It should be noted that on February 11th of this year, someone also forged a United Press message saying that the Ministry of Finance had announced that the US dollar exchange rate had been changed to 2,000 to 1. Various newspapers published it without investigating, and the legal currency fell sharply for a time. After the United Press denied it, the market immediately recovered.</p>
<h3>The Fortune and Rongfeng Stocks Plummet and Trading Volume Dwindles on the Shanghai Stock Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange operated for only half a day for both spot and forward deliveries, as it was the day before the Western calendar's New Year's Eve. Spot transactions are to be settled and cleared the next day (December 31) to close the year's accounts. Forward transactions are to be settled on January 6, to coincide with the start of the ninth forward delivery period on January 4. Market trading volume decreased, but sentiment remained relatively positive. Financial institutions continued to engage in arbitrage trading of Yong Yarn (永紗), which briefly rallied mid-session, but rumors of instability in a certain small-cap stock triggered a sharp decline near the close. The market opened slightly lower due to the bankruptcy of Fuxing. Fuxingxiangji Securities was Broker No. 58 at the exchange, and also operated a gold trading business under the name Xinchengchang Gold Shop. Due to recent business losses, it suddenly declared bankruptcy yesterday. The individuals responsible for the firm are Wu Zi'e and Wei Guanwei, according to reports.</p>
<p>After the market opened, brokers No. 160, 78, 83, and 218 were all sellers, and spot Yong Yarn retreated to 589 yuan. Forward delivery was seen as low as 620 yuan. Later, brokers No. 198, 180, 14, 145, and 124 entered the market as buyers, and brokers No. 89 and 229 appeared with forward delivery orders, gradually driving prices up. Brokers No. 212, 75, 137, 47, 4, and 197 also bought. After 10:30 a.m., sentiment improved as financial institutions, in addition to unwinding their arbitrage positions, also increased their buying. Off-exchange market prices were quoted higher, with spot Yong Yarn rising to 636 yuan, and forward delivery reaching a high of 663 yuan. Later, brokers No. 198, 218, 151, 70, and 91 sold slightly, causing a gradual decline. Although there were fluctuations mid-session, rumors of instability in a certain small-cap stock, coupled with Rongfeng falling to its limit down from broker No. 151, caused the decline to accelerate near noon, showing signs of exhaustion. The market slightly consolidated at the noon close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meyer, and Wah Fung rose slightly, while Xinhe and Xinguang declined slightly.

<h3>A Large Number of American Goods are on their Way</h3>
<h3>About Fifty to Sixty Ships are En Route; If They Cannot be Imported into Shanghai and Taiwan, They Will be Diverted to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] According to reliable sources: since the settlement of the West Coast maritime strike in the United States, about sixty American merchant ships are heading for China, and only about one tenth to one-fifth of them have arrived. The goods on board include post-war relief supplies, cotton, machinery, and daily necessities. However, this situation cannot be interpreted as the United States attempting to dump excess production onto our country. In fact, the domestic fabric market in the United States today has a large demand, and exports account for a very small proportion of its total production. Taking dyes as an example, because the supply cannot meet the demand, there is also a black market in the United States. Smaller Chinese import and export companies in the United States are willing to pay high prices to procure supplies by any means. The amount they purchase is larger than that of larger import and export companies. As for machinery, domestic demand is also high, and most of what can be purchased in the United States today is second-hand goods; if you want to place an order, the delivery period may be one or two years later. Although there is paper being exported, domestic demand is also strong. In order to promote their business with China, many large American companies are inviting managers of large-scale Chinese import and export companies to handle their transactions in China. Since the implementation of the import permit system, the actions of general importers are under detailed study. A reporter asked a leading figure in the import and export industry: If the goods on the sixty merchant ships coming to China cannot obtain import permits, what will be done? The answer was: generally, they will be imported into Hong Kong and then imported into our country's market when the opportunity arises.</p>
<h3>Special Committee for Silk Export Progressing Smoothly</h3>
<p>According to related sources, the authorities are concerned about the decline of the local silk weaving industry. After repeated discussions between the Central Trust of China and the National Bank, it is proposed to form a Special Committee for Silk Export. The committee will provide rayon and raw silk materials to various silk weaving factories and oversee their business expansion for export and technological improvement. At the same time, the industry is also preparing to organize a silk weaving production and sales company with a registered capital of 500 million National Currency, which will be funded by outstanding manufacturers in the industry. The funds have already been fully subscribed. The matter is currently under discussion with relevant parties, but the matter is of great importance and must be planned comprehensively and approved by the authorities before it can be implemented. It is reported that after several consultations, opinions are quite close, and it is expected that it can be realized around February next year.</p>

<h3>Students at Guiyang Normal College Reject New President Launch Movement to Protect the School</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guiyang Airmail Dispatch] Qi Panlin, the president of National Guiyang Normal College, took leave of absence due to bereavement and has not returned from his hometown. The Ministry of Education recently announced that Du Shuji, an associate professor at the college, will take over as president. Du graduated from Peking University and recently went to the UK for observation under the Ministry's order. Upon hearing the news, the students of the college, believing that Du's qualifications were insufficient, unanimously opposed the appointment. The student union organized a Protect-the-School-Reject-Du movement. The entire student body jointly wrote to Du, asking him to resign voluntarily, and telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting it to appoint a qualified person. They also published a statement to the public, stating that the movement was launched to improve southwestern culture and had no political background. Subsequently, they held a reception for the press at Guanshengyuan, releasing a written statement as follows: (1) The significance of the protect-the-school movement: to oppose Du Shuji's taking over as president of the college, but not to support President Qi, but to hope that the Ministry of Education will appoint a qualified person to take over as president of the college.

<h3>Cheeloo University Restoration Ceremony - Grand Restoration Celebration</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan by Our Newspaper] Jinan's premier private institution, Cheeloo University, solemnly held its Restoration Commemoration Ceremony during this year's Restoration Festival, which is Christmas Day, in the university's auditorium. Provincial leaders, including Chairman Wang Yaowu, and approximately 500 faculty, students, and distinguished guests gathered, making it the largest gathering in Shandong's cultural circles since the victory. The ceremony began with a report from President Wu Keming.</p>
<p>Cheeloo University's History Briefly stated: Our school was founded 47 years before the founding of the Republic of China, making it 82 years old. It was initially established as the Literary Institute in Dengzhou by Dr. Divie Bethune McCartee of the American Presbyterian Church. It later merged with the Guangde Academy University Department of the Qingzhou Baptist Church, renamed Guangwen Academy, and moved to Weixian. Subsequently, the Medical Institute established in Jinan by Dr. Hunter Corbett of the American Presbyterian Church and the National Academy established in Qingdao by the English Baptist Missionary Society merged in Jinan as the Republican Medical and Theological Academy. In 1917, the aforementioned schools formally merged in Jinan and were renamed Cheeloo University. In 1923, the Peking Women's Medical School also merged with Cheeloo University's medical department, becoming a co-educational institution. In 1929, the theology department separated, and three colleges of liberal arts, science, and medicine were established. On December 17, 1931, the Ministry of Education approved its registration.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, our school was ordered to relocate westward. In the autumn of 1938, it cooperated with West China Union University in Chengdu, and our school resumed operations in Rongcheng. Through great efforts, not only were the original departments and the National Studies Research Department restored, but also, to adapt to objective needs, a manufacturing department and a parasitology department in the medical research institute were established. Faculty and staff in Jinan also traveled inland by various routes, and the foundation gradually solidified. After the Pearl Harbor Incident in 1941, the short-term vocational school originally established in Jinan by British and American faculty and staff announced its closure, and they also came west, further strengthening and solidifying our school's lineup.</p>
<p>After Victory Our school strived to resume operations, and this spring, Provost Sun was dispatched to Jinan to oversee the work. With the assistance of Chairman Wang Yaowu and others, the university has gradually regained its former appearance. In terms of school buildings, after Jinan fell, the enemy occupied the school and used it as a military hospital. Therefore, the exterior of the school buildings is largely intact. After half a year of repairs, urgent needs have been preliminarily met. In terms of books, after the enemy occupied the area, they initially planned to burn them, but after negotiations, they were sent to Guangzhi Academy for safekeeping. Fortunately, most of them have been preserved, including the rare and well-preserved "Quanyuan" national masterpiece. In terms of equipment, the losses were greater. For example, our school originally had 200 microscopes, but now only 20 remain. Based on the current number of students, they are barely sufficient. In terms of students, all freshmen in each department are recruited in Jinan and officially began classes on October 1st. Students in the sophomore year and above will temporarily remain in Rongcheng to study at West China Union University, and some faculty members will also remain in Rongcheng to teach. They will return to Jinan to resume operations after transportation is restored. There are currently 21 faculty and staff members and 267 students at the Rongcheng campus. At the Jinan campus, there are a total of 215 freshmen in the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and medicine, 50 in the preparatory class, and approximately 300 students in the sophomore to senior years, with each class ranging from two to 26 students.</p>
<p>Future Plans Provost Sun Ensan reported on future plans: (1) The Medical College is recruiting well-known scholars from China and abroad to teach and has obtained all the equipment for an affiliated hospital with 150 beds, which will be completed in order as transportation is restored. (2) Starting next year, the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences will be merged into the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the original departments will be adjusted. The radio technology specialty will also be restored. (3) An agricultural and engineering college will be established to assist Shandong's industrialization.</p>
<p>Education First Chairman Wang delivered a speech, stating that Cheeloo University's restoration was earlier than other universities, which is an honor for Cheeloo University and also an honor for Shandong. He continued: The strength or weakness of a nation depends on the development of education. During this period of national construction, education is paramount, and we should pay special attention to educational development. After Chairman Wang's speech, Director of Education Li Taihua delivered a speech, followed by a speech from a representative of the alumni. After President Wu's thank-you speech, the ceremony concluded in the midst of heavy snowfall and the solemn university anthem. (Special Correspondent Fan Shizhi from Jinan)</p>

<p>A Warm Current in the Cold</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Art and Culture Dynamics</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Hangzhou, 26th, by our special correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou thrives in the spring and autumn seasons, and West Lake enjoys its golden age during these times. People from all directions come to Hangzhou in cars, bringing funds to beautify West Lake.</p>
<p>Although Hangzhou is very hot in the summer, many people gather on the lakeside to cool off when night falls. Only winter is West Lake's most deserted season. A few people huddle and hurry past the lake, and loneliness and boredom represent the entire West Lake. Although Zhejiang has not experienced war this year, everyone's heart is heavy, and the entire industry and commerce of Hangzhou are sluggish. Intellectuals such as public educators and university students are living through difficult times, with thin clothing and bedding, wondering how to spend this long winter night.</p>
<p>First-Time Literary Evening</p>
<p>Materially impoverished, and with a general decline in art and culture across the country, Hangzhou is also anemic in spirit. I once wrote an article titled "Hangzhou Entertainment Desert" to fully explain the lack of proper entertainment. Fortunately, my efforts were not in vain. The Weekly Ball Club has been established, and several cinemas, which were screening films faded by the times, have switched to showing the latest domestic films. The puppet shows on Yingzi Road have disappeared, and the municipal authorities are paying attention to entertainment containing harmful elements. However, these spiritual foods have not been cooked and cannot stir up Hangzhou's passion, so the heart is still heavy, and a chill is felt when the cold wind blows. Many young friends, after holding the first literary evening, mustered their courage again and organized the second literary evening. As they said, "We want to throw a small stone on this still lake surface to create a small ripple, and in this freezing weather, create a trace of warmth to melt this cold atmosphere." This time, it was truly lively. The auditorium on the fourth floor of the Youth Association was packed with people. Roughly estimated, there were more than 700 vibrant hearts, including professors and students from Zhejiang University, National Chekiang University, and the National Academy of Art, as well as journalists and civil servants. Old playwright Xiong Foxi specially came from Shanghai to participate. Filmmakers Tao Xiong and Huan Yang Feiying happened to be in Hangzhou and also attended on time. Bursts of light and warm applause, bursts of happy laughter, and bursts of sympathetic sighs made everyone feel excited and enthusiastic. Everyone felt warm. Yes, spiritual warmth is better than material warmth, and the thirst for spiritual food is better than the thirst for material food. You only need to see that this literary evening lasted for four and a half hours, but no one left early. Some were even standing without seats. This shows the hunger and thirst for spiritual sustenance felt by Hangzhou's intellectuals.</p>
<p>It can be said that the literary evening has ignited a warm fire in Hangzhou, allowing Hangzhou to gain spiritual warmth.</p>
<p>Soochow University Anniversary Celebration</p>
<p>Soochow University also appropriately held its centennial anniversary celebration. President Li Peien said, "I hope students will not seek official positions or wealth." University education is inherently about research education, and they should value truth and promote academics. This truth and academics are the source of human spiritual warmth. This year's Soochow University centennial anniversary included an exhibition, sports competitions, plays, and concerts. They should have several outstanding academics appear on the mountain peak of scenic Qianjiang River in the future to warm the people near West Lake. At the same time, we urge Soochow University to immediately spread these artistic talents to society.</p>
<p>Song and Performance Break the Silence</p>
<p>At this time, the Zhejiang Provincial Drama and Song Troupe is also performing "The Teacher of All Ages" in the auditorium of Hangzhou Normal School on the banks of West Lake. They have undergone a considerable period of rehearsal, preparing to break the long-silent theater scene in Hangzhou. When the drama movement in the world's metropolis—Shanghai—is declining, Hangzhou, as a city, stubbornly attempts to perform plays. This not only provides the broad masses with spiritual food but also provides theater workers with unparalleled warmth.</p>
<p>Theater Troupe Restored - Theater Movement Unfolds</p>
<p>Will the drama movement in Hangzhou continue to unfold? The National Academy of Art Drama Troupe has been restored and has begun rehearsing its first play. The script has been selected as "Thunderstorm." At the same time, the Zhejiang University Foreign Languages Department Drama Class is preparing to form the Zhejiang University Drama Troupe to perform plays. These young people at Zhejiang University have demonstrated outstanding theatrical talent at the literary evening and will definitely be able to perform even more wonderfully in the future. Using these three strong theater groups to promote the drama movement in Hangzhou, as long as they have the belief of not fearing failure and not allowing discouragement, they will definitely be able to achieve something.</p>
<p>Our Newspaper Holds a Grand Exhibition</p>
<p>The Hangzhou office of our newspaper is also launching a relatively large-scale exhibition at the end of this winter, starting on New Year's Day in 1947. This exhibition has been approved by the main office, and the main office has mobilized manpower to actively prepare. Part of the content will be the literature of our newspaper over the years, and another part will be precious current affairs photos. A newspaper with a long history can reflect the needs and mission of the times. In its literature, one can see the progress of the times. Therefore, many people are wondering why this exhibition is not held in Shanghai or Nanjing first, but rather in Hangzhou first. Our answer is: "In the cold and desolate winter of Hangzhou, we are willing to throw a piece of firewood to warm her spirit!"</p>
<p>Woodcut and Calligraphy - Fu Will Exhibit</p>
<p>It is said that there will also be a woodcut exhibition and a calligraphy exhibition. A philatelic exhibition that is currently being held is at the private Circulation Library in Gulou. This exhibition is divided into two parts: philately and banknote collecting, with items from various countries and China, symbolizing the history of the Republic of China. The banknote collecting section collects various genuine and counterfeit banknotes from China, symbolizing the past chaotic society of the Republic of China gradually progressing to a unified national path. This exhibition is organized by the Circulation Library, and the director is Mr. Chen Duxing. He founded this library with his salary from the post office. Now, this old cultural warrior with a full head of white hair has also stepped forward and is enthusiastically active.</p>
<p>The above are all the art and cultural activities in Hangzhou this winter. These activities may be like ripples in a still lake, like sparks in the darkness, or like warm currents in the frozen earth. In short, the winter in Hangzhou does not feel too desolate or too cold. This slight warmth makes those who feel spiritually impoverished reveal a knowing smile.</p>
<h3>Early Cold in the South</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch, our special correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>When snow is falling in various parts of Jiangnan, the sun is still shining everywhere here, and it is as warm as spring, without any hint of cold. However, in the past week, the weather has suddenly changed, with strong northerly winds and drizzle. The thermometer has dropped to around 40 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not particularly severe. However, in this city known as the "Capital of Hot Air," there is no adequate cold protection equipment, so this cold wave has caused the entire market to become deserted. After nightfall, most citizens stay indoors, and stores close early. Although this is just the early cold in the south, it already feels like a harsh winter!</p>
<p>A Season for the Wealthy</p>
<p>Winter seems to be a season for the wealthy. With the arrival of winter, the newly purchased Haeberlein fur coats, worth over a million yuan, of the wives and young ladies have the opportunity to show off. And the American-style equipment of the gentlemen and masters, even if it is the leftover materials of Westerners, can certainly be used to boast to the shivering common people on the streets. High-end restaurants have long prepared expensive dishes such as "Chrysanthemum Five Snakes," "Cold Protection Sheng," and "Dragon, Tiger, and Phoenix Grand Gathering" for the noble people, which are perfect for gathering around a stove and drinking wine to ward off the cold. Therefore, with the arrival of winter, all major restaurants are making profits a hundred times over. Although a "snake soup" banquet costs hundreds of thousands of yuan, what does that matter in the eyes of the gentlemen and masters? According to a survey by the Municipal Tax Bureau, the total amount spent each month in major restaurants exceeds 130 million yuan. This huge number cannot be said to be unsurprising! Furthermore, dance halls are also the best places for gentlemen and masters to enjoy themselves in winter. The melodious jazz music is enough to stir up the dancing spirit of gentlemen and ladies. Although Guangzhou's industry and commerce are depressed and the social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the dance halls are overcrowded and there is no shortage of consumers! Currently, there are more than ten larger dance halls here, and there are countless dance academies. It is said that several large-scale dance halls are being planned, with the budget to open around Christmas and the New Year!</p>
<p>A Tragic Corner</p>
<p>However, with the arrival of winter, there is another tragic side to society. Due to the sudden cold weather, most poor citizens are not prepared with warm clothing and are filled with worry, unable to find a solution. Even the small public servants, with the prices of all cold protection items being extremely high, can only hope for the unattainable, and they can only continue to wear thin clothing and run around the streets shivering. Especially the refugees who sleep on the streets, wrapped in their thin bodies with broken burlap sacks, do not dare to stick their heads out in the biting cold wind. Although there is no accurate statistics on these refugees, we can see them curled up everywhere in any prosperous area, at the bottom of those tall buildings. The state of hunger and cold, combined with misery, is truly indescribable. However, the people who enter and exit the tall buildings have become "accustomed to seeing" them, so it is as if they are "unnoticed"! According to statistics from the health authorities, there were as many as 61 bodies buried on Yanli Road in this week alone. So, how many are there that have not been buried? In short, in these few days, it is estimated that more than 15 refugees die from cold and starvation every day! Therefore, in these few days, thousands of returned overseas Chinese refugees have surrounded the Good Relief Sub-bureau, requesting the distribution of warm clothing, and dozens of refugees have forcibly robbed relief rice. All of this is enough to show the seriousness of the problem, because they have to struggle to prolong their remaining breath!</p>
<p>Winter Relief</p>
<p>It can be said that the authorities have long been concerned about this issue. The Winter Relief Association was officially established as early as the 3rd of this month (December). The plan seems to be quite thorough. The plan is to set up 23 cold shelter stations, each capable of accommodating 100 to 500 people. In addition, 5,000 cotton-padded clothes and 5,000 burlap clothes will be distributed, and five meal stations will be set up. In addition to this, there will be temporary relief for fire, disease, and small loans. The estimated total cost is 76 million yuan. However, judging from the past few days, the progress of the association's work has been too slow! The number of people freezing to death is increasing daily. The meal stations will not start until the 18th, the locations of the cold shelters have not been fully found, and the huge amount of funds still needs to be raised through various methods. It is only feared that after several meetings, a discussion will be held and then a resolution will be made. After the resolution is made, it will have to be implemented. By then, the poor and needy refugees who need relief will have already "solved the problem themselves"!</p>
<p>Market Fluctuations</p>
<p>As for industry and commerce, the biggest fluctuations in the past week should be in the financial market, which can be said to be changing rapidly and progressing amazingly. Within just one week, gold jumped from 340,000 to 425,000, Hong Kong dollars rose from 982 to 1360, and US dollars also jumped from 4700 to 6300. In this state of frenzy, I believe there are many people who are happy, and many people who are sad! Apart from this, all other industries and commerce are in a crisis of recession. Due to the flooding of the market with imported goods, and the low quality of domestic products, which are unable to compete with them, coupled with the increasing number of labor disputes and the rising wages, which cannot meet the fragile purchasing power of the general public, the market has become sluggish and production has been declining. It is estimated that since the restoration, 60% of Guangzhou's industries have been shut down. Therefore, with no way out for industrial and commercial capital, some speculative merchants have turned to high-interest lending. According to the current situation, lending out one million yuan can generate a profit of one million yuan after three months. With such a short period of time and such a large profit, who would still invest in legitimate industries and commerce? Therefore, the so-called "underground banks" of Qiu are very active. Many manufacturers, feeling pinched at the end of the year and short of funds, are struggling to cope, while the speculators who specialize in high-interest loans often take advantage of their plight. Once there is a problem with cash flow, they have no choice but to go bankrupt. Bankruptcies due to the influence of high-interest loans have been heard of daily in the past week, and the situation is likely to be even more dire as the Lunar New Year approaches!</p>
<p>Enforce Winter Defense</p>
<p>Speaking of public security, it is originally most serious during this winter defense period. However, under the stringent winter defense measures enforced by the military and police authorities, including nightly door-to-door household checks and increased patrols by the military and police, the public security in the market can be considered barely satisfactory. Although the Municipal Police Bureau handled more than 200 robbery cases in November, it is obviously much more peaceful here compared to the terrorist situation in Hong Kong, where bombing incidents occur everywhere! However, there are a few things here that make some citizens panic all day long. The first is the problem of cracking down on street vendors. In order to implement the plan to rectify the city appearance, the municipal authorities have implemented strict crackdowns on street vendors. Although the authorities have designated locations for them to set up stalls, according to statistics, there are nearly 200,000 street vendors in the city, and the designated markets are limited, inevitably leading to a "more monks than gruel" phenomenon. As such, a number of street vendors will experience a panic in their lives!</p>
<p>Military Service Issues</p>
<p>Secondly, everyone does not know that military service is a glorious obligation. As a result, when the conscription news is announced, young men of military age are all restless on their beds, and some young men are preparing to flee to Hong Kong to avoid conscription in case they are selected. The Provincial Commercial Advancement Association is further arguing that the foundation of industry and commerce has not been stabilized since the restoration, and that the hasty conscription of military service is truly afraid that people will be panic-stricken and flee to one another, affecting the prosperity of the market, and requesting a one-year postponement from the authorities. At the same time, the city's conscription quota is 1,200 people, and more than 500 people have already entered the camp, with more than 600 people still owed. The association is willing to encourage voluntary young men to enter the camp to make up the conscription quota, so that there will be no need to draw lots for conscription. However, the authorities believe that it does not conform to the purpose of the military service law that everyone has the obligation to perform military service, and it is not convenient to make a decision. Therefore, the association has been discussing and petitioning for several days, and there is still no result. Finally, there is the issue of allocating 1.2 billion yuan in police fees for donations to all stores in the city. This was originally passed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and is intended to raise this amount within six months. It will be used to assist the government in reforming the police administration, consolidating public security, and enabling all merchants and civilians in the city to live and work in peace. The legal basis is good. However, in this depressed industrial and commercial environment, each store is already struggling to cope with this year's end, making them feel that they are willing but unable to afford this first month's amount of 200 million yuan. It may be even more difficult to raise funds in the future! Therefore, everyone hopes that the authorities can properly handle the above-mentioned issues to avoid arousing public resentment, otherwise it will be even more difficult to maintain the overall social order!</p>
<p>The Haizhu Bridge Under Repair</p>
<p>The bridge is being repaired by the Guangzhou Municipal Government with an allocation of 400 million yuan, and construction began on December 2nd, with completion scheduled within 60 days. Above: Distant View. Below: Close-up (Special Correspondent Liang Feng)</p>
<h3>New Mine Shaft in Huainan Under Construction</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Kang Feng, Wuhu, 20th</p>
<p>The feudal nature of our Chinese society has always encouraged the construction of towers on the ground, as symbols of obedience to authority and superstition towards gods and ghosts. With the incessant construction of towers above ground, stonemasons and tile workers rarely have the opportunity to build towers underground.</p>
<p>In the Huainan mining area, a new No. 3 shaft under construction evoked the above feelings. Watching the winch at the shaft mouth lower a platform laden with stones into the shaft, and then hoist out the excavated rubble and mud, I couldn't help but think of a tower construction project.</p>
<p>This No. 3 shaft, with a diameter of five meters, requires a retaining wall of stones to be built two hundred meters deep, and then cemented on the outside of the stone wall. To open such a mine shaft, it requires the excavation of a column of earth and waste rock five meters in diameter and two hundred meters high, like the body of a tower. Time, transportation labor, wall-building labor, as well as stones and cement are necessary conditions. Six months is not too short. After two hundred days, this tower can unearth the bounty beneath the earth. The company plans to produce seven hundred tons of coal per day from this new No. 3 shaft. At that time, the contribution of this new underground tower in Huainan will be far greater than building a tower above ground with the same stones!</p>
<p>Guangzhou's Six Banyan Pagoda (Special Correspondent Liang Feng)</p>
<p>That night, as I rode an empty coal car into the mining area to transport coal, the red light from the coking furnaces in the East Mine, burning in the open air, painted an orange-colored picture of labor in this desolate mining area. Also, because the coke production of the Zhongxing Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Shandong, had ceased, the foundries of Beijing and Shanghai reached out to Huainan for assistance. Currently, only the coal from the East Mine in Huainan can be used for coking. Eighteen coke ovens, large and small, were in the open field, some just having finished refining the coke, others glowing red, burning coal into coke. Three tons of coal are refined into one ton of coke, which sells for 500,000 yuan. Only 300 tons are produced per month. However, this labor in the Huainan mine is to alleviate the failure of the Zhongxing Coal Mine. Huainan does not seem very interested in coking, because the coal quality is not very suitable for coking.</p>
<p>Impressions of Miners' Lives</p>
<p>In addition to seeing the miners' working conditions in the mining area, I also visited the miners' living quarters separately. The quarters I visited were located closest to the employee residences. Engineer Zhang Youxian said that it was the most miserable area among the three thousand housing units, so that a news reporter could come into contact with the most painful group to understand the failing parts of this giant system.</p>
<p>I went at 3:30 in the afternoon. The midday shift had gone to work, those working the late-night shift were sleeping, and the early-night shift workers were eating. The group of workers I saw included coal miners, cart pushers, and underground carpenters. Their faces were yellow, but their bodies were still strong. They were all from northern Anhui. They ate a kind of hard, cold rice crust, with a bowl of bean sprouts and pickles. A dozen shrimp were placed like treasures at the bottom of another bowl. They squatted on the ground to eat, the ground being their dining table. One could see at a glance that they could not talk about nutrition, it was not easy just to eat enough to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>Their clothes were old cotton short jackets. A two-zhang (about 6.6 meters) square room, half of which was a foot high platform, was covered with straw and a dirty, thin cotton quilt. From this sleeping place, you couldn't imagine whether sweet sleep would visit their tired bodies. Naturally, Snow White would not enter the living quarters of these more than seven miners, old and young, to clean and scrub their desolate and impoverished abode.</p>
<p>The miners' entire situation was laid bare before my eyes. There were no suitcases, drawers, wardrobes, or safes to keep their material possessions a secret, and their spiritual warehouse was also wide open. You hear:</p>
<p>"I am a heavy laborer (i.e., coal miner, carpenter installing tunnel supports, etc.), and my daily wage is 2,500 yuan."</p>
<p>"I am a light laborer (i.e., digging coal, dragging coal baskets in the mine), and my daily wage is 1,600 yuan."</p>
<p>"Before, the company distributed coal, one basket per person per month, which was enough for cooking. Now, 8,500 yuan per basket will be deducted from the wages."</p>
<p>"Seventy thousand yuan a month, and nothing is left after eating!"</p>
<p>These were a few miners without wives. Afterward, I went to a living quarter being built with reed stalks. The women said, "We are here to escape the Huai River flood. The houses at home were flooded, and not a grain was harvested in the fields, so we fled here to work first."</p>
<p>This piece of land is the living quarters area. The reed stalks for building houses were supplied by the contractor. The contractor recruited them to work, and first had to solve their housing problem. These newly arrived disaster-stricken miners did have some property, with each family having two or three redwood chests.</p>
<p>The total number of miners here is 10,000, mostly from Shandong. The reason is that the contractors from the Zhongxing Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Shandong, could not stand their ground because Zaozhuang had been in the hands of the Communist army for a year, so they all came to Huainan to contract mining and coal digging work. The Zaozhuang miners also followed them south. The next largest group was from Henan Province, followed by disaster victims from the flood-stricken areas along the Huai River in northern Anhui and the Yellow River flood area. There are very few locals from Huaiyuan County, where the mining area is located. Locals mostly do farming work, and if they are so poor that they have nothing, they become bandits. No one is willing to go down into the mine to be a miner, which is both bitter and poor!</p>
<p>Of course, because the mining area's equipment is modernized, the living quarters have electric lights and running water taps, which is not enjoyed in the countryside of Anhui and widespread China. But the yellow light of a five-candlepower light bulb illuminates the dim scene of the living quarters, making it even more desolate. The clean tap water cannot wash away the coal dust that miners get on their hands and bodies every day they go down the mine.</p>
<p>Of course, I asked the person in charge of the mine about my observations. Engineer Zhang Youxian, who is an expert in the mine's technology, said that the wage difference between the miners' actual wages and the wages issued by the company (for example, the company gives a wage of more than 3,000 yuan per worker, and the workers receive more than 2,000 yuan from the contractor) is related to the existence of some contractors in the mine. Now the company is turning large contractors (each contractor has about 100 workers) into small contractors, and at the same time, encouraging workers to form their own labor cooperative teams to manage the underground mining work themselves to establish a direct relationship with the company, so as to avoid the expense of the middle layers. Engineer Zhang Youxian has additional information about the portion of workers' actual wages, which is that each person receives 2.5 jin (1.25 kg) of flour per day, and 8,500 yuan per month for coal fees to buy a basket of coal at 8,500 yuan per basket stipulated by the mine for cooking and boiling water.</p>
<p>The Organization Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs sent a Duan to guide the organization of the trade union. The mine is naturally willing to have experts from the government's special labor administration department contribute to the welfare of the miners, so representatives of miners from various mines and departments are being put forward to prepare for the establishment of a trade union.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the mine owners in Huainan are not private capitalists, but a group of technical experts and veterans from the old mining era, and they are also striving to support these hardworking people in their relationship with the miners. For example, Tianjia'an is building a flour mill, which, when completed, can produce 24,000 bags of flour per month at a low price to supply the needs of miners and road workers. There is no shortage of dilapidated housing units among the 3,000 housing units, and more than 1 billion yuan is being used to build new housing units to supply the miners who currently live in dilapidated houses. Although these technicians are not very specialized in labor-capital relations, they are all righteous people with abundant feelings, and human sympathy will burn them at any time to implement this coal kingdom's policy to benefit the miners!</p>

<h3>The Future of Huainan Coal</h3>
<p>Huainan coal has provided 40,000 tons of coal per month during this year, filling a need that the coal from Shandong and the Kailuan coal mines in Tangshan could not supply for the industries, electricity, and transportation of Beijing and Shanghai. In this year's support role, it has contributed more than any other aspect. However, people in the Huainan coal mine dare not reveal this achievement, and quietly survive and develop on the banks of the Huai River. The reporter learned that coal production has reached 54,000 tons per month, and the production line is still rising as high as prices.</p>
<p>According to Japanese estimates, Huainan Mine's reserves are 50 million tons. Datong Mine has been mined for 30 years, and Huainan Coal Mine has been mined for 16 years. It is estimated that more than 10 million tons of coal have been mined. The remaining 40 million tons of coal reserves, if 3 million tons are mined per year, the coal seam in this mine will be exhausted in 13 years. Of course, the current output is only 600,000 tons per year, so there can be five times as long a time left in the mine's unfinished history.</p>
<p>In order to extend the life of the mine, Xie Jiarong, Director of the Exploration Department of the Resources Commission, and Chai Dengbang of the Huainan Mining Bureau, have discovered new coal seams in Xinzhuangzi, Fengtai County, 20 kilometers from Jiulonggang, on the northern curve of the Huainan Basin. Regarding this point, details will be reported in another article.</p>
<p>How the social history of Huainan Mine will develop must naturally be sought in the progress of the entire Chinese society. Although it is surrounded by the ancient yellow Huai River, just as the backwardness and feudal nature of the Anhui countryside are very strong, the new atmosphere of industry must be rendered by these technically trained cadres with modern education in the still very bleak mining area!</p>
<h3>On the Eve of Establishing a City: Bengbu Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Kang Feng, Bengbu, 25th</p>
<p>On the eve of the establishment of the Bengbu Municipal Government at the midpoint of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, how is the situation in this most populous city in Anhui, and it has attracted much attention from all parties. A brief description is provided below:</p>
<p>Bengbu developed at a bend in the lower reaches of the large Huai River in northern Anhui. After the Tianjin-Pukou Railway passed through and a station was established here, the export of millions of piculs of miscellaneous grains and the annual import of four million piculs of edible salt in the Huai River basin must be resolved through Bengbu as a hub. This small market has developed into a commercial center where 260,000 people live today after decades of development. Due to the convenient transportation, low wages, and proximity to industrial raw material production areas, this commercial area has also planted tall chimneys in the last twenty years, with forty cigarette factories, two large-scale flour mills, and a large vegetable oil factory building production machinery on the banks of the Huai River.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Anhui Provincial Government established a municipal preparatory office here, which initially only had jurisdiction over the Municipal Police Bureau. In April of the 35th year, the Bureau of Public Works was established. When Zhang Xuexin, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, started municipal public works in the urban area, no funds were available at all. He jokingly called himself like a street sweeper, only having to work, but not enough cleaning tools to use.</p>
<p>Eight Years of Disaster</p>
<p>Bengbu left behind by the Japanese had blocked sewers, broken roads, and garbage like small mountains, perched in various parts of the city and emitting foul odors. Electric lights were dim like ghostly fire. Director Zhang Xuexin had so much hard work waiting for him, and he was a young man doing business for the first time, so he constantly used some hard methods to rectify them one by one.</p>
<p>His method was that the disaster victims who escaped from the Communist Area in northeastern Anhui had labor, and the Anhui Relief Branch had relief flour. He acted as an intermediary to combine labor and flour to form the power to clean up Bengbu's municipal administration. In the past six months, the sewers have been dredged section by section, and 2,000 tons of soil have been removed to fill the low-lying areas in the suburbs of the city. The sewers were clear, the streets were repaired, and the garbage was also taken out to fill the low-lying areas. In addition, south of Bengshan Park, the small road connecting the railway station and the Huaihe Wharf was expanded into a straight trunk road. This road was named Zhongzheng Road to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday. If you know the effectiveness of this railway station and Huaihe Wharf in Bengbu, you will of course also know the role of this straight Zhongzheng Road in the suburban traffic of Bengbu in the future. Zhang Xuexin hoped that this road would become Bengbu's "Nanjing Road" in the future. (Shanghai's most prosperous street.)</p>
<p>Bengbu's Electric Lights</p>
<p>Before the war, there were seven kilowatt generators, but the Japanese took them away. Now there is only one 250-kilowatt generator left, but Bengbu's public and commercial electricity consumption reaches 30,000 degrees per month, exceeding the load, and the lights are as dim as ghostly fire. Now, the Anhui Relief Branch has applied to UNRRA to purchase a 500-kilowatt generator, which costs 250 million yuan, payable in eight months. This generator is being installed and can be turned on by the end of the year, and Bengbu's electric lights and power supply can be resolved.</p>
<p>During the summer when the Huai River floods, the water level exceeded the water level of the 20th year of the Republic of China by two centimeters. Thanks to the pre-cultivation of 20,000 units of labor on the Huaihe Dike in the spring, the dike did not break, and the city area was also fortunate to avoid flooding. Bengbu was originally a three-no-man's-land at the intersection of Fengyang, Lingbi, and Huaiyuan counties.</p>
<p>Establishment of Municipal Government</p>
<p>After the establishment of the municipal government, it can govern an area of ​​416 square kilometers. In the future, Bengbu's municipal construction, such as building the Huaihe Wharf, opening a water plant, establishing a modern transportation road system, and expanding the power supply, cannot be accomplished by the poor methods of the past six months. During the municipal office era, raising the salaries of 800 policemen in the Municipal Police Bureau every month was enough to make people feel anxious and exhausted. The Bengbu Municipal Government will be established on New Year's Day of the 36th year, but how to raise funds for a municipal construction and the expenses of expanding the staffing of the office? It is inevitable that it will fall on the 260,000 citizens again. Bengbu is a commercial area, and the 260,000 people will naturally transfer these municipal expenses to the import and export goods and hand them over to consumers in a wider area to divide the tax. After the establishment of the Bengbu Municipal Government, what the reporter hopes is that the tax revenues drawn from the people will not be wasted. Doing one thing will benefit Bengbu's industry, commerce, and residents.</p>
<h3>The United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization is Preparing to Carry out the Grand Strategy of Datong</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Hong Fu, Paris, 5th (Airmail)</p>
<p>The progress of world affairs invariably moves from simple to complex. Twenty-five years ago, when the League of Nations was convened, hastily stepping into the meeting place and catching a glimpse of the errors in the documents was already troublesome enough. At that time, those who attended the grand meeting for the first time were like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, dazzled and at a loss. Who would have expected that the international organizations twenty-five years later would be larger in scale and more numerous in name? If one does not catch up with the new trend head-on, one will inevitably feel regretful for being unable to keep up. Silently observing the differences between the two international organizations twenty-five years apart, the so-called "League of Nations" at that time, after the general assembly, divided its work into six sections: (1) Law, (2) Specialized, (3) Suppression of Armaments, (4) League of Nations Budget, (5) Women's Issues and Narcotics, and (6) Politics. Except for the second specialized section, most of it was political debate. Upon closer examination, it was dry and uninteresting. The lack of specialized facilities at that time was undeniable. Now, there is both a Security Council and councils for the guardianship of weak and small nations to replace the disarmament and political sections. It is also known that specialized endeavors that will benefit the welfare and future of the masses should be strengthened. The simultaneous undertaking of eleven specialized areas, especially the "United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization," is a new initiative that the League of Nations did not have in the past. It is believed that the attainment and permanent maintenance of future world peace must have two complementary and mutually reinforcing key policies that advance together. The first key policy is that whenever a war hazard occurs, smaller ones must be resolved through the judgment of the International Court of Justice to eliminate disputes between countries, and larger ones must convene a United Nations General Assembly to mobilize the capabilities of the entire world to respond as appropriate and jointly impose sanctions. As for the second key policy, it is to make far-sighted arrangements for the happiness of the world's population in advance, so that countries respect each other and understand each other. This is the foundation of world peace, which should be cultivated in peacetime. Comparatively speaking, what was relied upon to maintain peace after 1919 only focused on the first of the above two items. The business was all political talk, and everything was too simple. Recently, after 1945, the quest to maintain peace has also focused on the second of the above two items (this newspaper's bird's-eye view of the United Nations organization). Therefore, the Scientific and Cultural Organization should be the main tool of the peace plan. The grand strategy of Datong that this bureau is preparing to carry out is divided into two major outlines: "Temporary" and "Permanent." Those with temporary characteristics are the cultural and educational revival of the occupied areas of World War II, which has already been put into practice. The permanent goals that should exist should be divided into several groups. There are many wonderful new ideas and innovative news that can provide intellectuals with unexpected benefits and conveniences.</p>

<h3>Teaching Children to Gamble?</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>I often find children standing by the mahjong table watching and commenting when their parents are playing cards, as if they are enjoying it. Strangely, the parents do not forbid them. Sometimes, I even see mothers asking their sons to play on their behalf and proudly praising their children's intelligence and shrewdness. This seems like a small thing, but it actually has serious implications for the children's future behavior and prospects.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that gambling is a bad habit, and no parents want their children to learn to gamble; but in fact, due to parental negligence, they are teaching their children. Children have a strong imitative nature and a good memory. Seeing their parents play cards naturally arouses a sense of curiosity, so they stand aside and learn silently. After a few times, perhaps before their parents even realize it, they have learned almost everything in their little minds. By then, even if you forbid it, it will be of no avail!</p>
<p>For parents who do not want their children to learn to gamble, I hope you can buy more educational books and toys for your children to prevent them from getting bored and watching cards; at the same time, when you are playing cards or gambling, you should forbid your children from watching and learning. As for children who have already learned, it is best to tell them the harms of gambling and absolutely not allow them to have any gambling behavior! The good or bad of children depends entirely on the education they receive in their youth. I hope every wise parent will pay attention.</p>
<h3>American Housewives</h3>
<p>— Bi Lang</p>
<p>Life is Very Different Before and After Marriage</p>
<p>In the United States, we can certainly only dream of the luxurious and comfortable life of a very small number of wealthy women. However, most middle-class housewives, like our Chinese housewives, feel economically strained, but their women are more capable and have more skills, and they handle all family matters much better than we do.</p>
<p>American middle-class women, before marriage, are indeed like what we see in their movies, read in books, and hear from gilded doctoral scholars: they are extremely comfortable and behave loosely, but after marriage, they have to take on the entire responsibility of the family's accounting, operation, and future child rearing. They never hire people to replace themselves. Their actions are very quick, and their work is exceptionally organized, step by step, without stopping or slacking. Every morning, they have to get up to prepare breakfast, and after their husbands leave for work, they clean the house and wash clothes. If there are young children (infants under two years old), around ten o'clock, they push the strollers to the park to play, while knitting wool yarn. After lunch, they have to take care of all the chores and then push the strollers out to play again. Because in the United States, except for some aristocratic classes who can live in high-rise buildings, middle-class people rarely have good, comfortable homes, so they have to take their children out to get some fresh air.</p>
<p>They also have a special talent for taking care of children. They never carry the child in their arms when working, but always let him lie in the cradle. And these children rarely cry, especially at night, they always sleep very quietly.</p>
<p>Most American housewives behave very steadily. Because they rely on their husbands to maintain their finances, their greatest task is to make their husbands happy and make the family comfortable and harmonious. This is very different from our so-called "new women" in China who only know how to spend money and do not know how to manage a household! Moreover, they are also very understanding of their husbands' difficulties. Sometimes, in times of family economic panic, they will also shoulder the burden and go out to find work, and they will never complain. In the United States, there is simply no such thing as couples being estranged, scolding each other, or fighting.</p>
<h3>My Ideal Wife</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>The course of life is like a long journey, and on this long journey, everyone hopes to have a lifelong companion. Therefore, I also hope to find an ideal wife.</p>
<p>An ideal wife should have a healthy body, progressive thoughts, moderate education, a happy mind, a gentle personality, and the virtue of diligence and thrift. These advantages are absolutely necessary, because they are enough to help the husband obtain comfort in spirit and achieve success in his career, and it is also necessary to create a sweet and happy family.</p>
<p>I do not ask her to have a beautiful face, because I know that beauty is not a condition for maintaining love between husband and wife. But many people misunderstand it, thinking that choosing a wife must first choose a beautiful one, while neglecting the beauty of character. The ancients said, "Beautiful women have bad fate since ancient times," which shows that an ideal lifelong companion does not have to rely on a beautiful face. The conditions that can maintain the relationship between husband and wife permanently are the four words "respect, love, sincerity, and kindness." If they are missing, it is difficult to get the joy of family happiness. She should understand that a lifelong companion is the friend who spends the longest time together in the process of life. Both parties must reach the point of respecting and loving each other and confiding in each other. Only by always comforting and understanding each other can they get through a life of unpredictable prosperity and decline. If the two hearts between husband and wife cannot be connected, they will complain and be angry in times of frustration, without comforting and encouraging each other; they will indulge in enjoyment in times of success, without awareness and vigilance. Then, sooner or later, a beautiful family and the feelings of the couple will be shattered.</p>
<p>Her family does not have to be rich. The most appropriate is a woman with professional experience, because she not only has the experience of being independent, but also has some understanding of everything in society. She is naturally better at dealing with social interactions, which is of great benefit to me. She knows that diligence and thrift are virtues, not a sign of being stingy. She should fulfill her responsibilities in dealing with social interactions, and she should not have a shy and fearful heart. She should manage household affairs in an orderly manner and educate her children with earnestness and patience. With such a wife, wouldn't it be possible to create a happy, beautiful, sweet, and happy family?</p>
<p>I am looking for such a lifelong companion in the vast sea of ​​people, and I hope that there will be a day when it will come true.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Housekeeping</h3>
<p>— Shun Ding</p>
<p>Silverware, such as silver spoons and silver cups, can be kept shiny and new if they are placed in borax water for four or five hours from time to time.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent woolen fabrics from shrinking, you can put them in boiling water for the first time before washing them. After the water cools, take them out and dry them in the sun, and they will never shrink.</p>
<p>When people are working, the local clothes are bound to be oily due to rubbing and rubbing, which is not elegant, especially for worsted fabrics. You can mix ammonia and boiling water in half each, and wipe it with a sponge or an old toothbrush. After letting it dry naturally, brush it with a board brush, and the oily light can be removed as new.</p>
<p>If you want leather shoes not to leak, you must soak them in sesame oil and take them out after one day and one night.</p>

<h3>Canned Food</h3>
<p>— Gu Tonggao</p>
<p>——Will it spoil if left in an opened can?——</p>
<p>Many people believe that food left in an opened can will quickly become toxic. However, for some inexplicable reason, this notion doesn't apply to canned milk; we have a long-standing habit of opening a hole in a can of milk and using it until the can is completely empty.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to other foods besides milk, it is generally believed that they will become toxic if left in an opened can. Therefore, people often transfer the food to another container, which is often made of the same metal as the original can and has not been sterilized, yet it is used without any doubt.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are some foods that should be emptied into another container, but not because there is a risk of harming health. Some dark-colored fruits will fade if left in the original tin can. Also, some acidic foods will undergo a corrosive action when exposed to oxygen. After a few days, they will corrode the container, and the food will develop an astringent taste because it has absorbed a small amount of iron.</p>
<p>The fact is that a can is still the best container for most canned foods when unopened. Unless there is a reason to the contrary, at least the can is sterilized. A basin or plate is very likely to carry bacteria, and the food can be said to be the best environment for them to grow.</p>
<p>In any case, the most important point is that any opened canned food should be regarded as something that can easily spoil. The nature of the container is actually only a secondary issue. (Translated from Reader's Digest, October issue)</p>
<h3>Selective Hearing</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhi, translated from Reader's Digest</p>
<p>I know a lady who lives in a busy area of the city. One hot evening, she felt very tired, so she went to bed early. The ringing of the telephone could not wake her from her sweet dream. The fire trucks going back and forth nearby and the loud radio dance program from the next room did not move her at all; she slept soundly. Her younger sister even brought a group of classmates, and they opened the refrigerator, played musical instruments, and made a lot of noise, but still couldn't wake her. But a miracle happened. At that moment, a very slight sound came from the room behind her; calling out, "Mom!" She immediately jumped out of bed like a bullet shot from a gun and rushed to her three-year-old child's bedside.</p>
<h3>Beautifying the Home</h3>
<p>— Mai Jixian</p>
<p>Matching Colors Should Be Sought</p>
<p>To furnish a modern and beautiful home, one should start with colors, as colors are most attractive. They can make you feel serene, cool, or bright and warm. Therefore, the color scheme of a room is an invisible element that regulates the atmosphere of a home. Color coordination is not a difficult task. As long as you understand a few basic principles, you will develop an interest in it. Recently, furniture companies have been constantly reforming the styles of furniture and paying more attention to color coordination. Carpet, wallpaper, and curtain companies are also actively moving towards beautiful patterns and coordinated colors.</p>
<p>Colors have varying degrees of depth, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most important consideration is that they must be coordinated under the principle of not conflicting or hindering each other. If bright red or bright green is used in the interior, you will feel dazzling no matter what. However, if the same amount of white is mixed into bright red, it becomes a pleasing pink color. As for light colors, they are not very noticeable on their own, so other colors must be used to reflect their light. For example, light blue doesn't seem delicate on its own, but if placed next to light cream, it will complement each other. In any case, colors should be evenly distributed and naturally beautiful under the principle of not conflicting or hindering each other.</p>
<p>No matter how harmonious or artistic the colors are, the only condition is that they must be suitable for the season. For example, the light blue and cream colors mentioned above are most suitable for bedrooms and are suitable for spring, summer, and autumn. However, in winter, you will find them to be cold. Conversely, hanging bright red curtains in the bedroom in the summer will make you feel hot. Similarly, wearing a light-colored robe in winter, even if you feel warm yourself, others will shiver when they see it. From this, we can see that there is a great connection between climate and color, and the conclusion is that light colors are suitable for warm weather, and dark colors should be used in cold weather. In this freezing weather, if light-colored curtains are still hanging in the room, you should remove them and replace them with dark colors—such as dark blue or bright red—and I believe you will feel that the room is full of warmth. As for furniture, it can be divided into Chinese and Western styles, and the colors must be properly coordinated. For example, mahogany furniture should be paired with bright red silk chair cushions and table skirts to highlight its antique and distinguished nature. However, using bright red silk on sofas is simply unsightly and unappealing. Conversely, white cloth cushions placed on mahogany furniture will give a feeling of death and mourning. The same white cloth, when placed on Western-style furniture, makes us feel that it is pure and generous. In short, color coordination must be determined according to the climate, location, and style. If any of the above three are mistaken, even if money is spent, a comfortable and satisfactory result will not be obtained, but it will hinder the harmonious atmosphere of the family.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Soliciting Reader Feedback</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This publication posted a notice on the first of this month soliciting reader feedback. We have received a total of 840 reader letters. Originally scheduled to be published in the middle of the month, the process of sorting them took longer than expected, and due to limited space, we have selected nine letters for publication below, in the order they were received. A "Note from the Editor" is attached as a reply.</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Even if your newspaper hadn't solicited criticism, I would have wanted to make a contribution to "Spring and Autumn." This is because your newspaper is one of the more readable newspapers in Shanghai among the reading public, and "Spring and Autumn" is indeed a literary supplement that is constantly improving and has some works worth preserving.</p>
<p>Based on the meaning of "Spring and Autumn blames the wise," I would like to first point out a few shortcomings: (1) It seems that too much space is occupied by content of the same nature within a single edition, and there seems to be a slight lack of variety in interests within consecutive days. (2) "Spring and Autumn" should discuss everything, but it seems that too little is discussed about China, and even less is discussed about foreign countries while also discussing China. (3) It is good that you pay attention to prose, but prose, in particular, must pay attention to content. I think that if you could synthesize the content of Chinese notes and anecdotes and write them in a light and lively style, it would be very suitable for a supplement.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, I suggest that you should have several suitable regular contributors who divide up two or three types of writing to be published daily or every other day, and use the remaining space to accommodate special, valuable occasional contributions. You should not tailor your editorial policy to the manuscripts you have on hand, but should solicit manuscripts targeting the hopes of various readers. This is the ideal for a further improved supplement. To realize this ideal, it would be even better if you could expand the space a bit. In my opinion, "Spring and Autumn" has a great hope of becoming a standard national daily newspaper supplement. It is worth doing so.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate to clarify that the discomfort that we readers feel is that we have just read an interesting piece of writing, but the next time we want to read it, it is gone. Readers' interests are certainly different, but they all want to read something with content. If it is something that everyone has in mind, they will certainly not be happy, and this is certain. Therefore, using this as a standard to select articles will surely meet the hopes of most readers.</p>
<p>In the past two months, Mr. Hong Weifa's "Yangzhou Continued Dreams" has been extremely lovely and will surely become an immortal work if it is published separately in the future. Also, the essays signed by Ge Xixi are extremely valuable in terms of both writing style and content and can become a system. These all seem to be things that should be published regularly in rotation.</p>
<p>— Jin Ping</p>
<p>(No. 4, Lane 166, Shaoxing Road, Shanghai)</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>"Spring and Autumn" is the literary supplement of Shen Bao and has a large number of readers. Its space is indeed valuable, and the editor's humble solicitation of reader feedback and his eagerness for innovation are especially admirable. Without considering my ignorance, I offer my humble opinion:</p>
<p>Literature and art are a reflection of real-world politics, economics, society, and all aspects of life. The development of literature and art should address the shortcomings of real life, so that it can be of benefit to the times and to life. The great works of great poets and great writers have always been products of their times. For example, reading the poems of poet Du Zimei about the chaos allows one to understand the state of displacement during the "An-Shi Rebellion." Bai Letian's ten "Qinzhong Yin" poems reveal the greed and darkness of powerful officials during the Zhenhe and Zhenyuan periods of the Tang Dynasty. The two chapters "Deng Le You Yuan" and "Su Zigecun" write about the despotism of those in power who held military authority at the time, revealing everything without reservation. Reading his poems is like experiencing the situation firsthand. Furthermore, Han Wengong, who "started the decline of the Eight Dynasties and rescued the drowning of the world," wrote "Yuan Dao," which completely rejected Buddhism and Taoism, and painfully discussed the abuses of monks and Taoists who lived off the fat of the land. It was also a criticism of the times. Therefore, the angle of writing is to reflect the times, and the mission of writing is to guide the times. Reality is writing, and writing cannot be separated from reality. As for the clear and light-hearted discussion of wind and moon, and the search for chapters and ancient knowledge, it certainly has its value. However, looking out at the world and assessing the current situation, encountering an era as fiery as it is, and seeing the surging tide, works of leisure and tranquility seem less necessary than articles that guide the times.</p>
<p>In the past three months, your publication has been working hard to improve in terms of selection of manuscripts, editing and layout, form and content. Readers are naturally satisfied. However, I hope that you will pay more attention to the "reality" of the selected manuscripts.</p>

<p>Three</p>
<p>I personally am a reader of this publication, and I also use my pen to write articles. Three sentences cannot leave my profession. The writings I write are mostly small pieces about art (limited by the number of words, I dare not write too much). If readers (referring to people outside the circle) don't feel a headache, I would like to suggest to the editor that every Saturday, there should be an introduction and criticism of art. (Not to promote writers) A few days ago, I already talked with Hua Lin, Jian Hua, Chong Peng, and other brothers about establishing an objective and fair art criticism, and saying some things that should be said.</p>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>(Huangshan Art Garden, Chongfei South Road, Shanghai)</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>In any newspaper, the supplement occupies a very important position. On the one hand, the supplement can adjust the tastes of readers. On the other hand, it is also a garden for the public, allowing readers to have the opportunity to write and publish. Therefore, I can say with certainty that the rise and fall of a newspaper and the increase or decrease in sales are closely related to the supplement.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that Shen Bao has the most supplements (in fact, the weekly is also a supplement), and it is also more able to meet the ideals of our readers.</p>
<p>"Spring and Autumn" is a pure literary supplement. In terms of quality, because the level of recording is very high, the impression given to readers is satisfactory. As for the quantity, I think that because there are too many long manuscripts and the serialization is too long, only three or four articles can be published at a time, which reduces the interest of readers. This is because overly long manuscripts are not suitable for publication in the supplement. If more short, concise, and interesting essays and sketches were published, and the long novels were also best finished in one or two months, it would not only encourage the interest of the authors in writing, but I would have a suggestion, that is, I hope that "Spring and Autumn" can hold a "Literary Award" once a month, and publish the top six winners. This will further arouse the interest of readers. This is the second point.</p>
<p>I am a loyal reader of "Spring and Autumn". For the sake of caring for "Spring and Autumn", I boldly submitted this "criticism and suggestion" letter. However, what I have put forward is only a principle.</p>
<p>— Wanshi</p>
<p>(Sent from Shanghai)</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Your publication is the supplement that I like best in all newspapers. I used to read it carefully every day, but in the past month, I have been cutting it out and keeping it every day. Now it has gradually accumulated into a thick stack, and I often browse through it in my spare time, and I feel that it is infinitely meaningful.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw that you published a solicitation for readers' criticisms of your publication, so now I will contribute some of my humble opinions to you. Perhaps a fool's thousand thoughts may yield one gain, and it is not yet known.</p>
<p>After flipping through the twenty or thirty copies of your publication that I have cut and saved, "Yangzhou Continued Dreams," "The Case of Ouyang Xiu and Zhu Shuzhen's (Sheng Zha Zi)," "On the Fuchun River," "The Biography of Pellissier-Velan," "Memorandum on Silkworm Affairs," "Qinhuai Moon," and "Zhang Daqian, as I Know Him," can arouse readers' interest, and they can also increase the opportunity for readers to publish manuscripts, directly encourage the courage of authors, and indirectly help increase the sales of newspapers. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Since the supplement is a garden for the public, and "Small and Exquisite Notes on Suzhou" and other articles are what I like to read, after carefully analyzing them, they can be classified as anecdotes, travel notes, biographies, essays, self-cultivation, etc. Articles that are empty and full of long sighs are what I hate. I hope that your publication will publish more of the above types of articles, especially constructive articles that can increase readers' knowledge and improve readers' character.</p>
<p>— Lin Wengu</p>
<p>(Sent from Zhenjiang)</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Your publication has always been very careful in selecting materials, and the editing is also quite artistic. There is nothing to consult about. However, since the teacher is so humbly soliciting readers' opinions, and in order to continue to make your publication "strive for perfection," I, standing in the position of a reader, would like to briefly state a few points as follows:</p>
<p>1. In terms of selecting manuscripts, focus on literature: solicit more humorous and witty essays (or lyrical prose poems), and short academic and literary articles with substantial content. Except for "An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood," which should continue to be published, other ordinary long articles that are not realistic and lack content should be published less, so as not to occupy space in vain.</p>
<p>2. In terms of form, try to make it as artistic as possible. The size of each day's edition should have a certain standard. For example, your publication now mostly occupies one-half of a page, but sometimes it is inevitably enlarged or reduced, which seems to need improvement.</p>
<p>3. Regarding illustrations, I hope to select more fine works by famous people, such as "Floating Mist and Distant Peaks," "Landscape of Eastern Zhejiang," "Orchids," etc. last month, which are full of a poetic flavor that makes people enjoy them.</p>
<p>The above three points are my opinions on your publication, and also a little hope from readers for your publication. I provide it for reference.</p>
<p>— Wang Shaomin</p>
<p>(Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Government, Hefei)</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>Whether it is the editor of a large newspaper or the editor of a small newspaper, they should have a "humble" "sincerity" to accept the criticisms of the vast number of readers. Like Mr. Jin Shan, the editor-in-chief of this newspaper's "Spring and Autumn," he has such a heart, which is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Let me say something further. Before the Holy War, Mr. Li Liewen, the editor of this newspaper's supplement "Free Talk," was as cautious and strict in his attitude towards accepting manuscripts as Mr. Jin Shan, the editor-in-chief of "Spring and Autumn" is now. He does not add any other colors to the pure literary garden. This is the "advantage" of "Spring and Autumn" now, which has aroused a welcome resonance from a wide range of readers.</p>
<p>Now, as a reader who cares about this publication, I would like to offer a little contribution to "Late Autumn," but it is only a little bit of superficial opinion.</p>
<p>1. The "Spring and Autumn" of the past was quite substantial in terms of the format of the arrangement and the "quality" of the content. However, I feel that most of the articles published are focused on "urban" characteristics, and very few articles are seen that take the dynamics of people from all walks of life and the vast peasant groups as their themes. Therefore, in addition to "luxury," it is very difficult for readers to smell a bit of the simple, unadorned, and cheerful smell of the laboring masses. I hope that this publication will publish more articles related to people's livelihoods or depicting the dynamics of people from all walks of life in the future.</p>
<p>2. In "Spring and Autumn," I hope to read more articles by new authors in the future, and do not let a few old writers worry about it all the time. On the one hand, we should try our best to support "newcomers," and make "Spring and Autumn" a truly public garden.</p>
<p>3. In the future, in addition to publishing medium-length serials, I hope to publish more short stories, and match the wonderful parts of the novels with "woodcuts" to set them off, which will be even more welcomed by the vast number of readers.</p>
<p>— Zhang Tie Zhu</p>
<p>(Deqing County Library)</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>I am a loyal reader of your publication. Whenever the newspaper deliverer brings Shen Bao, I always take out "Spring and Autumn" first to read it carefully, and then read the other news. Here, I will record the same feelings of several readers of your publication that I am familiar with and offer them to you, sir. I don't think you will blame me for being presumptuous!</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the majority of people who love to read tend to prefer short literary creations, almost the majority of readers feel the same way. The next are essays, short poems, etc. They are not very interested in introductions to people, book reviews, art reviews, and introductions. The reason, according to their explanation, is that the good and bad of people and works are obvious to all, and will never increase or decrease their status and value due to biased comments. As for long articles that are too long, they are often interrupted and cannot be continued.</p>
<p>In terms of selecting manuscripts, I also hope to select what is liked by the majority of readers as the best.</p>
<p>Regarding editing, it is best to plan the appropriate space for each day's Spring and Autumn. For example, how many fractions of a whole should creation occupy, and how many fractions of a whole should essays, poems, etc. occupy? Introductions to people and art criticism are not unwelcome, but it is best to set aside a specific day of the week to introduce and comment on them in detail, so that readers can also concentrate on studying them.</p>
<p>The above are a few points that I have written down in a rambling manner. They are absolutely written with sincere enthusiasm, based on the hopes of a large number of people. I don't think you will blame me for "not knowing what is important," right?</p>

<p>Editor, you are planning to improve this publication and soliciting reader feedback. I am one of the readers, and it is just right to take this opportunity to express a little confusion. However, of course, it is not "criticism!"</p>
<p>(1) Empty and lengthy unnecessary papers are best not published, or reduced.</p>
<p>(2) Publish more short and concise reporting-oriented short creative works.</p>
<p>(3) Publish more short academic papers with research value.</p>
<p>(4) Publish more essays with considerable content.</p>
<p>(5) Publish more new poems with artistic value. Regarding the above points, I seem to have to repeat the statement about new poems; in this silent poetry world, it is just right to set off a torch of progress and make it flourish. I wonder what the editor thinks?</p>

<h3>Waiting for the Ferry (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<h3>Year End Chapter</h3>
<p>— Fang Huan</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>I carry a knapsack of melancholy on my back, a knapsack I previously exchanged for a tremendous price. – The warmth of a loving mother, the coziness of home, and the lighthearted romance of youth… For years, wandering the world, unable to withstand the sandstorms and dust of the northern lands, my knapsack has become somewhat tattered. Occasionally, when I look down, I realize my shoes are torn, and my clothes appear shabby. After wind and rain, an additional layer of scars is etched upon my heart. I am still young, I remind myself, so why am I so sorrowful? Several times I have stumbled and fallen into the treacherous pitfalls of the world, rising again each time, casting my gaze into the distance, where more thorns and greater difficulties lie ahead.</p>
<p>Beside the road of life, in a fleeting inn, under the oil lamp amidst the pattering of rain on banana leaves, I meticulously count the stitches of my loving mother, the close stitching before departure, the repeated reminders of adding earth to the quilt at night, when will be the day of return? The heart of the wanderer is about to break. My hair, once gently caressed by her loving gaze, is now marked by the traces of wind and rain instead of my mother’s touch. Ruthless time has stripped away these few remaining comforts, leaving a blank space in the depths of my lonely heart.</p>
<p>The human world is so cold!</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>In my childhood, in my hometown, the weather was similarly bleak in late autumn, yet the feeling it gave me was not so stark and lonely.</p>
<p>Growing up in a mountain town, I did not know what color the water hyacinths of late autumn possessed, nor what kind of mood the reed-lined riverbank held. I only knew that once autumn arrived, those scorching maple forests would resemble countless young torches, burning across the entire mountainside. Standing beneath the red maples of West Mountain, I would watch clusters of cotton-like white clouds gather from behind the mountain, then slowly drift towards another peak. The autumn wind was fierce, yet beside the bamboo fences of the mountain dwellers, a pair of innocent lambs still playfully butted heads, frolicking.</p>
<p>“Are you cold?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go up the mountain!” On the mountain, we lit an even larger fire, with heaps of withered grass and fallen leaves burning while crackling. The wind was strong, so the fire blazed even more fiercely. In an instant, I felt boundless warmth. We took off our outer garments, our souls leaped, and our blood boiled. Through the blazing flames, I could faintly see the rosy cheeks of my companions flushed like apples. Then we looked at each other and smiled, our laughter scattering with joyful songs into every corner of the mountain. In the intense firelight, the emotions of childhood were melted together, and the pure hearts of the children were refined to even greater purity.</p>
<p>We then considered ourselves little Prometheuses. – That great fire-bringer, who did not hesitate to endure the suffering of the desolate forbidden area of the Caucasus, stealing the sparks of stars for humanity.</p>
<p>And accepting the enlightenment of the stubborn spark, we yearned for the struggles of tomorrow to be so difficult, the battles of tomorrow to be so arduous.</p>
<p>But——</p>
<p>“With fire, we are not afraid of the dark!”</p>
<p>“With fire, we are not afraid of the cold!”</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Due to the call of the torch of life, my reason grew strong. Over the years, I have searched diligently for truth, with the same urgency and piety as Muslims making a pilgrimage to holy sites.</p>
<p>And like a worldly weather bird, I am highly sensitive to changes in the wind and clouds. I cannot bear every moment of suffocating air, and I am alarmed by every dark cloud in the sky, as if they are all harbingers of thunderstorms. I hardly dare to believe in the hypocritical warmth of winter, because what often follows it is an even colder and more intense snowstorm... Like the cries of apes or the wails of ghosts, the north wind howls in the distant pine forest. Mountain rain is imminent; how profound is the atmospheric pressure!</p>
<p>I grope for a path in the boundless darkness, and on long, moonless nights, I yearn for a ray of hope. Unexpectedly, just when I am praising the light, it vanishes in a flash. After dawn, there is still a vast fog, the gloom and bewilderment of endless darkness.</p>
<p>I live a series of gloomy and bitter days.</p>
<p>I dream that the traps of the desolate sun are endlessly expanding, expanding.</p>
<p>At the window, I discovered the first strand of white hair of youth.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>I have come to understand hatred.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>But now it is winter. The fields of Jiangnan are left with only gloom, desolation, loneliness, and emptiness, unable to conceal the weariness and fatigue. The ancient fields reveal deep wrinkles, also unable to hide the toil of a year's labor. Old oxen in the low-lying pens utter sighs of vicissitude. Among the paths between fields, on the banks, are scattered weeds, firewood scraps, withered vines, old trees, and drowsy crows... I reminisce about whether the ponds and rivers of my hometown have dried up, and whether the resplendent maple forests have faded from their blood-red color.</p>
<p>Wild grasses hide vitality, lurking with life force, waiting for the sprouting of next spring in the silvery snow. The singers of the era are also silent, preparing for another passionate chorus of life in the spring of next year after a period of hibernation in the harsh winter.</p>
<p>Then why not be silent? Learn in silence, remember in silence. If it is said that there is no silence in people's hearts, then what lies dormant after silence is perhaps an even greater power.</p>
<p>"Silence! Either erupt in silence, or perish in silence!"</p>

<h3>Chronic Starvation</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra, in an unsuccessful plea for the issuance of their December salaries, sent a letter to the mayor on Christmas night, written by all forty-three members, which contained the memorable line:</p>
<p>"We believe that nothing is more tragic than watching our comrades gradually die from 'chronic starvation,' especially since the survival of the group of signatories below, for the sake of our cultural contribution, is not without value."</p>
<p>"We are not prepared to ask you for any other benefits beyond what we deserve. Just say a word and issue the salaries, and you can ease the pinched bellies of many musicians in dire need. Dear Mayor, will you have this little bit of compassion?"</p>
<p>At this time and place when various industries are giving out large year-end bonuses, there is unexpectedly this interlude of requesting timely salary payments. What kind of world is this? It is truly filled with contradictions!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra is the former Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Mei Baiqi devoted his life to establishing its tradition and glorious history. It can be called the pride of Shanghai. It is unanimously praised by musical circles both domestically and internationally. However, achievements in art are not enough to guarantee not having a "pinched belly" and "chronic starvation." There are too many stories like this, especially in the music world.</p>
<p>Someone told me that those who play music in hotels and restaurants earn nearly a million yuan a month, and the hotels and restaurants also provide two snacks and one dinner. I really want to advise the friends of the symphony orchestra, why bother being foolish and talking about art? Who wants your cultural contribution anyway! You might as well fill your stomachs first. At least in hotels, restaurants, and dance halls, you won't suffer from the pain of chronic starvation, right?</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Nattering</p>
<p>A woman and a child boarded a streetcar, buying only one ticket, and squeezed into the car.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," said the ticket seller, "you should buy a ticket for that child too."</p>
<p>"But he's only three years old!" she protested.</p>
<p>"He looks like he's six years old to me."</p>
<p>"You should realize that I've only been married for four years."</p>
<p>"Hey, lady, I just want you to buy a ticket, I don't want to hear your life story or your confession!"</p>
<p>Cowardice Against Cowardice</p>
<p>Mike and Jane, a pair of close friends, quarreled one day, and as a result, they challenged each other to a duel. Both were cowardly weaklings, so they decided to duel in a completely dark room with pistols.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed that Mike would shoot first. Trembling, he groped his way to the fireplace and fired upwards into the chimney—but instead, he shot Jane down.</p>
<p>The Wrong Person</p>
<p>A specialist from the Education Department was once visiting a rural primary school when he became very angry at the noisy sounds of a group of unruly students next door. He furiously opened the door to the adjacent room and pulled out the tallest boy, because he seemed to be talking the most nonsense. He dragged the boy out of the classroom, into the next room, and told him to stand in the corner.</p>
<p>"Now, you stand there silently!" he ordered.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, a little child poked his head into the room and said, "Sir, I'm sorry, but could you let our teacher come back?"</p>
<p>Wrong Name</p>
<p>A young housewife was complaining to her neighbor about her husband's frequent late returns home.</p>
<p>"I've cured my husband," her friend told her. "A few weeks ago, one night, he came home very late, and I called out, 'Hey, dear Jem, is that you?'"</p>
<p>"And that was all it took?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she smiled, "because my husband's name is Pierre." (Translated from the December issue of Crown Magazine)</p>
<p>Sobei</p>
<p>In thirty-five years, each of these three hundred and sixty-five pages is filled with "poverty" and "chaos." Poverty leads to chaos, and chaos leads to more poverty, forming a vicious cycle. Who knows where it will all end?</p>
<p>Victory for us is like "nine nines return to eighty-one," still no victory. Ashamed to meet New Year's Eve, I feel that everything is wrong and useless. However, "survival" and "despair" stand side by side. Even on the verge of despair, one must do everything possible. Even a "fatalist" would still say: "Do your best and leave the rest to fate!" There is absolutely no reason to "let it be!" Moreover, "the road turns and the scenery changes," "when the willows are dark and the flowers are bright"! Only cowards and lazy people are afraid of seeing "hope"! Dear friends: Tonight, we send away poverty and chaos. Thirty-six years will be a year of "hope"!</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve Housecleaning</h3>
<p>— Shengjie</p>
<p>The year thirty-five has come to an end. New Year's Eve arrives quickly. Stores are busy closing accounts, and government agencies are rushing to prepare financial reports. Yes, after ending a year, one must make a final accounting, and then one can peacefully celebrate the New Year. I think of the usual custom that every year-end, every place must be thoroughly cleaned. Most people often overlook the meaning of thorough cleaning, thinking that it is just sweeping and cleaning and sweeping away dust; in fact, cleaning, since it has added the word "thorough," should be "meticulous and all-encompassing."</p>
<p>I am ashamed to be a nominal civil servant, eating the public's food and taking the state's salary, but in fact, I have not fulfilled my responsibilities. I arrive late and leave early for work, and when I am happy, I casually write a few lines of "as requested," and when I am unhappy, I read tabloids. Anyway, I have a strong backing, and I fear nothing. I adhere to one principle: regardless of whether I am present or not, my name is always on the sign-in sheet. Therefore, I have muddled through this year. As New Year's Eve arrives, I ask myself and am filled with shame! Therefore, I frankly confess that during this thorough cleaning, "muddling through" should become the past, and "hard work" should begin today!</p>
<h3>Talking About Diamonds in Chaotic Times</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>The dazzling diamonds, how many people do they drive mad? How many people lose their virtue? How many people break the law? The price of diamonds is probably second only to the atomic bomb, right? Currently, the average market price per carat is about 985 US dollars, plus a heavy tax. However, to break it down, a diamond is not much different from a lump of coal; they are both just a small piece of carbon. It's just that one has become crystalline, and the other has not. But why is the price of diamonds so high? There are many reasons for this: some for rarity, some for fantasy, and also an artificial reason like currency management.</p>
<p>At the world's largest and most scientifically advanced Kimberly Mines in South Africa, to extract a half-carat diamond, rocks (or "blue ground") are dug up from 3,600 feet below the ground, poured into boxes, and workers are assigned to "pan for diamonds." The weight of the barren rocks is 320 million times the weight of the found diamonds. Many "diamond panning" workers have labored for thirty years and have never seen a diamond!</p>
<p>The world's largest diamond originally weighed 3,106 carats (about one and one-third pounds) and was discovered in 1905 by Frederick Wells, the surface manager of the Premier Mine in South Africa. This large diamond was named "Cullinan" in honor of the company's president, Thomas Cullinan, and was later escorted to London. Experts there estimated its value at 75 million US dollars! Wells received a bonus of 10,000 US dollars. Later, the Transvaal government of the South African Union bought it as a gift for King Edward VII of England, presenting it on his 66th birthday. The King paid an insurance premium of 725 US dollars, withdrawn from the Bank of England, for a two-hour viewing.</p>
<p>The "Cullinan" was later divided into five pieces by a diamond cutter named J. Asscher (one of which was later divided into many smaller pieces). The largest four pieces are now inlaid. The largest is "Cullinan I," pear-shaped, weighing 530 carats, and inlaid in the center of the crown.</p>
<p>The beauty and loveliness of diamonds do not simply come from their natural essence; a part of it also relies on human scientific technology. This technology is cutting and polishing, to increase the "facets" of the diamond, which increases its dazzling brilliance. Today's "standard brilliant diamond" has fifty-eight facets, each of which is cut into the most precise proportions using a diamond grinding wheel. The brilliance of a diamond depends on the amount of light reflected from its "facets," so the more facets a diamond has, the more brilliant it is.</p>
<p>Diamonds are not only used for decoration; they do have uses in industry—they can rotate parts of machines, manufacture grinding wheels, and draw metals into fine metal wires. Regarding the latter, it is truly an amazing skill. Three to four hundred tons of copper, passed through extremely fine holes arranged with diamond powder, forms copper wire long enough to encircle the earth twenty times.</p>
<p>Diamonds can be used in industry because they are the hardest substance in the world, not easily worn or affected by heat. Engineers use diamonds as drill bits when drilling hard objects. Dentists also use diamond drill bits to grind teeth. But strangely, industrial diamonds are very cheap, only 4 to 12 US dollars per carat. Why is this? It's very simple, because they are man-made—scientists make them from carbon. These artificial diamonds are not as brilliant or hard as real diamonds.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the artificial reasons for maintaining the high price of diamonds: the world's largest diamond producing areas are Africa and India. The former is located within the colonies of Britain and Belgium, and the latter is simply a British colony. The diamond mines occupied by Britain and Belgium account for 95 percent of the world's total. So they united to form a monopolistic control group, setting prices and maintaining them as they pleased. On the one hand, they make money, and on the other hand, they protect buyers from market fluctuations. If they didn't do this, supply and demand would change, and the price of diamonds would plummet.</p>
<p>Under the secular craze, the value of diamonds has been raised, and the pockets of some people have been filled.</p>
<h3>Reap What You Sow</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>The recent business downturns are truly frightening! Everyone blames them on "usury," saying that they have suffered from the evils of usury, so many businesses have been forced to close. But I want to "cry injustice" for usury!</p>
<p>Many business closures are actually due to "insatiable greed!" Like when gold prices were soaring, banks and gold shops frantically bought in, but unexpectedly, with a slap in the face, when prices started to fall, they were burdened and collapsed, and they insisted on blaming it on the disaster of "usury." It is truly crying injustice for usury!</p>
<p>The truly suffering from the evils of "usury" are ordinary shops! As the famous Chinese saying goes: "A true merchant has no capital." Doing business entirely relies on borrowing from outside, so when it comes to being affected by "usury," it is ordinary shops!</p>
<p>At the same time, the creation of usury was actually started by "speculators" and "hoarders." They wanted to "seize windfall profits," so they "inflated" interest rates! Recently, many banks and shops have collapsed, mostly because of "insatiable greed" in the past and "reaping what they sow" later!</p>
<p>So the reason why the "downturn" is so terrible is not just "the evils of usury"? The Supreme One said, "Disaster and fortune have no gate, only man invites them himself"! It's absolutely true!</p>
<h3>Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law</h3>
<p>— Li Xi</p>
<p>The previous "Periodic Talk" in "Free Talk" discussed the issue between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. The famous sayings and discussions have all been read. I intend to offer my humble conclusion as follows. As we bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, I wish everyone a happy family with this!</p>
<p>One (Mother-in-law): Not foolish, not silent, how can you be a mother-in-law? Not hearing, not asking, enjoying the bliss of leisure.</p>
<p>Two (Daughter-in-law): A mother-in-law is always a senior, and should be respected and filial. Your husband is still yours, why let him suffer?</p>
<p>Three (Son): Not biased, not prejudiced, having a wife but also a mother. Tolerate each other, be willing to work hard and endure grievances.</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 22</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Getting Money Is Always Difficult, Begging Is Not Easy Either</p>
<p>In China, begging is an ancient profession. In the lower classes of society, begging developed earlier than prostitution. As the saying goes, "After three years as a beggar, even an official wouldn't want to do it." Although it is an exaggeration, the mystery lies in the words "three years as a beggar." Scholar-officials have always looked down on beggars, thinking they are useless fellows, but this is not always the case. In the past, beggars had to be apprenticed to join the gang. Joining the gang is abstract, but "apprenticeship" cannot be done perfunctorily. Beggars must undergo various basic training for at least three years before they are considered skilled and ready to face the world. At that time, whether they want to be officials or not is up to them.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship to pass on the mantle is not necessarily done by the "beggar chief" himself. The beggar chief is like a school principal, and he has teachers who teach specialized subjects. For example, there are martial arts instructors for boxing, traveling doctors and herbalists for dispensing medicine and healing injuries, and music teachers for singing songs. There are many categories, with required and elective courses available. Student beggars must pay annual fees and can be taught as much as possible. The main points of business activities are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) "Learning Skills" — The most common skills include "nose balancing," "tongue piercing," "knife dancing," "bowl dancing," "ball juggling," and "money tricking." All beggars with sound limbs and no ailments must diligently learn one or two skills. This is easier to get money than begging in the streets or shouting wildly. The tools carried by beggars each have their own uses and cannot be arbitrarily disposed of, which would violate "gang rules." For example, porcelain bowls and bamboo baskets are used to beg for money, rice bags and iron pots are used to hold food, canes are carried to ward off dogs, and torn cotton-padded jackets are used to store money. Other tools such as the sanxian, huqin, clappers, drums, swords, halberds, racks, rat rings, monkey hats, and sheep clothing must be practiced and applied according to the skills learned.</p>
<p>(B) "Addressing Donors" — There are many types of addresses for beggars begging in the streets, and they must be used according to the person. Everything depends on judgment and experience. For example, (1) "Young Master," (2) "Master," (3) "High Master," (4) "Old Master" are used to address high-ranking officials, with distinctions based on age and status. For women, there are (5) "Madam," (6) "Old Madam," (7) "Great Grandmother," (8) "Young Madam," (9) "Miss," etc. If there are errors, such as calling an unmarried girl "Young Madam" or "Madam," they will be scolded and not get money. Therefore, it is safer to call young women "Miss" to avoid offending them. There are also (10) "Sir," (11) "Official," (12) "Uncle," (13) "Auntie," (14) "Rich Man," (15) "Rich Man's Wife," etc., which are used for couples, and you must be sure that they are a couple and that their status matches the address before you can say it. In addition, there are (16) "Officer," (17) "Boss," (18) "Shopkeeper," (19) "Auntie," (20) "General Manager," (21) "Mister," each with its own proper context, and you must call it out as soon as you see them, without thinking twice. These abilities all require experience.</p>
<p>(C) "Crying Training" — Whether begging on the street, walking or sitting, beggars must be able to cry. This is the same as with theater actors, and they must be trained. Otherwise, there is actually no "sorrow from the heart," so what about the emotion of crying? It is understandable that male beggars cannot cry, but they must still cry forcefully. Female beggars cry more easily, but it must be rhythmic and moving to be considered top-notch. Experienced and talented female beggars are confident in this skill. They often sit together by the roadside, wailing loudly, each cry filled with tears and each sentence moving, or they wail along the street with their young children, and as soon as they get money, they immediately stop crying and give thanks. The speed of stopping is amazing! Male beggars' wailing lacks artistic elements and must be accompanied by performances of disability to elicit pity.</p>
