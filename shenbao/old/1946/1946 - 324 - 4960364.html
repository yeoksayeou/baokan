<h3>憲草全部審議完竣　交中常國防會討論　經立法程序後提出國大</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕憲草審議會，十九日下午三時在孫科寓邸舉行第二次會，出席王寵惠，孫科，林彬，吳經熊，陳啓天，左舜生，張君勱，王雲五，繆嘉銘等，對昨日審議未完部份詳予研討，雷震亦參加。據聞：會議經過良好，原則上無變動，但因憲法爲國家根本大法，故均不厭求詳，字句推敲，至六時始畢。聞十九日已全部審議完畢，定廿日上午交中常會討論，下午交國防最高委員會討論，並於廿一日交立院完成立法程序，然後提交國民大會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕憲草審議會十九日會議中，對訂正稿最重要之增添或删改部份，有下列各點：總統章第四十五條下，增添「總統對於院與院間之爭執，除本憲法已有規定者外，得召集有關各院院長會商解決之」。開會時，各方咸認憲法中有增加此條之必要，因訂正稿對五院間之聯緊未有妥善之規定，萬一甲院與乙院發生爭執，若無排難解紛之辦法，則政府時有陷於僵局之　，增加此條後，即可避免此弊。行政一章訂正稿對政院各部會之首長如何任命，未予規定，與會者僉認，此點應於憲法中予以規定，協議增加「政院各部會首長及不管部會之政務委員，由行政院長提請總統任命之。中央與地方一章訂正稿第一〇八條「左列事項由中央立法並執行或交由省執行之」，「省」字以下加一「縣」字，改成「省縣執行之」，並加如下之一款：「省縣自治通則」，如是省將來制定省自治法時，須以「省縣自治通則」爲依據，縣雖不爲「地方自治單位」，然某自治色彩亦較訂正稿爲明顯。基本國策一章，與會者咸同意將訂正稿一四〇條「文化敎育應以發展國民之民族精神民生精神」下，加「國民道德健全體格」八字，該條最後之「爲基本原則」五字，亦予删去。訂正稿關於憲法之施行及修正，第「一四四』條第二項原作「法律與憲法有無抵觸，由行政院於該法施行後六個月內，提請司法院解釋」，根據此種規定，經行政院提出，即可交司法院解釋，且規定於施行後六個月內始可搽請解釋，流弊甚大，會中協議改爲「現行法律與憲法有無抵觸，發生疑義時，由司法院解釋之，並不規定由行政院提出，亦不限定於「實施後」若干時期內，自較妥善。開會時，對立法院與行政院之關係，亦曾加以討論，惟對訂正稿未作任何更動，各方所注意之　察院，立法院同意權，會中有人曾提出取消，惟未獲協議。據某參加會議者表示：總統若不經立法院或　察院之同意即得任命行政院長，司法院長，則總統之權未免過大，故「同音權」實有保留之必要。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕監察院十九日下午二時第一零二次會議，出席委員劉成禹，嚴莊，汪東等三十餘人，審計部部長林雲陔，次長劉紀文，祭屛藩，監察使高一涵，劉侯武，苗培成，李嗣聰，郭仲隗，田烱錦，張維翰等均列席，于院長右任主席，並報吿重要工作，次討論憲　草案中監察制度部份，各出席人分別發表意見，情形熱烈，至六時許散會。</p>
<h3>主席垂詢　審議經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕蔣主席於十九日晚邀宴張羣，張君勱，徐傅霖，王世杰，吳鐵城，張厲生，陳誠等，席間並埀詢憲草審議經過。</p>
<h3>政府與民社黨　進行密切商談　日內可獲得具體結果</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕政府與民社黨間，目前正進行一密切商談，政協秘書長雷震，頻訪張君勱，蔣勻田，十八日且談至深夜，十九日下午二時雷訪蔣談一小時，五時許復往訪，至七時始畢。據聞：此項商談，日內可獲得具體結果，且將經雙方發表公告。蔣勻田晚間接見記者時，會作如下之談話：「我們爲一普通政黨，爲爭取民主政治，採取漸進步驟，有任何方式可以推動民主政治一步，我們均可採用，我們也願意同任何政黨爲爭取民主政治目的而合作，如果目的不相同，自不能合作，所以我們爲爭取民主，準備隨時和政府談判，如談判成功，也要和政府隨時合作。我們同時爲遵照本黨之自由意志而行動，決不依賴任何方面，亦不向任何方面請示」。蔣勻田復表示：目前談判，天天都有其成功可能性甚大，因彼此均能爲人民，爲國家的利益設想。同時，民社黨乃本着政協決議案之精神做去，所有一切問題，只要國民黨能放棄一黨專政，眞正還政於民，且昭吿中外，均無疑問。又張東蓀日內可能來京，如燕大校務不能分身，亦將派胡海門代表來京，昨日赴平之孫寳剛，葉篤義，廿日可能返京。又民社黨另派洪少植代表，於十九日夜車赴滬，轉飛香港，與民社黨人士接治。</p>
<h3>張東蓀稱　不擬南下</h3>
<p>孫寳剛等定今離平</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕民社黨總部邀張東蓀南下之代表孫寳剛，葉篤義，定廿日乘機離平南返，張東蓀已決定不南下。今日民社黨留平常委胡海門已飛滬，傳達張東蓀對民社黨參加國大意見，廿日並將有民社黨在平要員萬仞千，侯百忍，隨孫氏南下與民社黨總部商討對時局意見。張東蓀十九日下午與孫寳剛，葉篤義，商談後對記者稱，渠不擬南下參加國大。遠在重慶政治協商會議時，民盟預定之百廿名國大代表中，即有張氏，張當時即將其名字勾去不擬參加。依渠個人意見，民社黨應該確會成立對國民黨共產黨都不開罪，以保特調人資格，庶能促進和平實現。渠並稱，第三方面之陣容，亟須整刷</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕民社黨北來代表孫寳剛，十九日對本報記者稱：（一）民社黨之是否參加國大，此時尙在黨內交換意見時期，尙不能有所決定。本人此次北來，係奉命探詢北方本黨同人意見，此問題極爲繁雜，甚望黨中同人能多到京滬觀察，俾便隨時注視時局發展；（二）民社黨此刻是吾參加國大不應太重視，如民社參加而國大不能通過政協修正之民主性憲草，則民社仍將反對國大，如民社不參加，而國大通過政協憲草，則民社仍將擁護此憲法；（三）民社與政府有某種距離存在，如政府日漸民主，此種距離即將日漸縮减，如政府離民主愈遠，民社與政府之距離亦愈遠。民社之是否參加國大，亦以政府民主性而定；（四）目前民社黨並未以黨參加民盟，而係若干黨員以個人資格參加民盟，故民社黨行動，理論上不受民盟的束。</p>
<h3>民盟態度　不再變更</h3>
<p>張申府談國大問題</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕民盟整日無動態，記者晚詢張申府，如民主社會黨參加國大，民盟是否可以考慮？張答，已確定態度決不參加。又中共代表團晚間已門庭冷落。</p>

<h3>國大豫備會花絮</h3>
<p>— 本報記者張明</p>
<p>預備會第二日的今天，會塲空氣顯然活潑生動得多，也表現得更民主些。</p>
<p>今天發言最受人歡迎的是朱經農，說話聲浪淸晣，有條理，扼要，嬴得不少掌聲。他每次發言時，站在麥格風前，手拉住麥格風柱，姿態頗像演話劇。</p>
<p>最叫人討厭的有兩個，一個是陝西工會代表，一個是農會代表。前者發言嚕囌，而且說不淸楚，台下嗤嗤之聲不絕，但是他依然是鎭靜地向下說，最後幾乎被逐下台。當他下來時，會塲轟然。後者是用在農村發動羣衆的姿態拿嘶啞的喉嚨來叫，又爲代表們不滿嗤之下台。這位先生一下台，陜工代表站在本位又爲他抱不平，彈出同情之調，認爲剝奪了他們的發言權。</p>
<p>蔣主席是九時廿五分到會塲的，夫人沒有同來。主席進塲時，洪秘書長正在報告，却立刻停止了，因而引起全塲的注意。</p>
<p>包德明是兩天之中，七十多個發言者之中的唯一的女性，她的座位在樓上，從麥格風裏播出來一聲女高音，宛似自天而降。他說的是有關婦女推選候選人的問題，可是沒有說到主題，就被人剝奪了發言權</p>
<p>表決時，第一次仍用舉手方式，許多人不滿意，提出質詢，這一點近乎孩子的好奇心，但是接着也有人提出了過分的過應，他說：「空位太多，如果有人把空位的電扭捺了怎麽辦？所以應提起注意。」自然，道也是一種出奇制勝的舞弊辦法，不過張道藩站起來說：「這種過慮是不必要的，可以請左右前後的人加以監視。」</p>
<p>天會剛開始不久，很有些人不耐煩，覺得主席說話的聲浪太小，於是一三四三號站起來又設了些主席在台上聽不到的話：「主席說的話後面根本聽不見，沒有聽到，自然沒有辦法表示意見，請注意！」但是這句話不過等於微風吹過水面，台上沒有反應，但是合下却因此有一陣紛亂，嗡嗡不絕</p>
<p>第一次表決時，就是爲了對草案的修正與不修正的問題，主席提出來付表決時，是這樣說的：「贊成修正原案的請舉手！」反過來說，就是不贊成原案。也就是舉手的人是不贊成原案，可是若干人只曉得舉手，自然是贊成，殊不知贊成的不是原案，經再次解釋後，始再付表決。</p>
<p>會塲空氣熱烈極了，也就自然的不安靜起來，尤其是發言者爭先恐後踴躍極了。發言內容各有千秋，有的是洋洋大觀，有的是引經據點，更有些又長又乏味，麥格風前常有等候機會的人，一來幾個人幾乎像等公共汽車。</p>
<p>一位代表正是把舊八股都拉出來長篇大論對稿演講時，主席發現他是「題外之音」，請他停止發言，但是發言的人聽不到，於是主席捺鈴也不行，使用許多方式都不能停止這項驚人演說。</p>
<p>在亂紛紛發言的情况下，一位代表先生發表如下之妙論：「要凌亂就凌亂（指會塲空氣）不凌亂就不凌亂，已經凌亂了就大家凌亂，爲什麽不在剛剛凌亂時予以糾正。」聽來像煞有道理，這一段話也確實够凌亂了。</p>
<p>主席是在休息時間離去的</p>
<p>水銀燈沒有開過一次，攝影記者乾等了半天。</p>
<p>會塲中很多人希望聽到左舜生的發言，但是他說，「今天我並不預備發言了。」言下之意明日再談。</p>
<p>正是快要表決的時候，吳鐵城宣了一張條子送到主席台，一會兒功夫洪秘書長站起來說：「請注意，新聞記者不要坐到代表席上去！」</p>
<p>休息時間宣佈爲五分鐘，實際自十時廿分至十時四十分，四倍於所宣布的。</p>

<h3>「殺人魔王」初度受審　丁逆默邨狡辯不逞　妄圖卸罪責經法官痛斥</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕「七十六號僞特工總部主任丁逆默邨，十九日整日在首都高院受審，聽衆千餘人，有證者進入法庭，無證者立階前，秩序井然，然遠不及周逆佛海受審時鬧熟。八時許，丁逆解至高院，衣海靑縐面駝絨袍，外罩藍布長衫，灰夾褲，黑皮鞋，枯髮糾結，面容憔悴，戴無邊眼鏡，於候審室中，吃麵點一碗後，即一一檢閱自白本。九時三刻，庭長金世鼎偕推事申屠宸，葛召棠，檢察官陳　祖開合議庭於大成殿，律師王龍，薛　齋及公役辯護人章神吾，亦相繼出庭。旋丁逆提　，開始審訊。丁逆自始至終，鬼鬼祟祟，虛虛實實，時或「記不得了」，時或「大致如此」，企圖塘塞了事。但以審判官精叫練達，嚴詞緊逼，丁逆詭計終於不售。</p>
<p>「表白」何必嚕囌　轉移目標的企圖終失敗</p>
<p>庭上首訊年齡，籍貫，職業，住址，丁逆含糊供稱：湖南人，四十四歲，住上海愚園路，以前在政界作事，未曾犯案。旋由陳檢察官　縷述起訴要點，審判長復詢其出身經歷，並對其赴港動機，嚴加追問。丁逆稱：十三年在粵作軍中政治工作，任上尉，國民革命軍總部成立時，先作秘書，後作參議，迨總司令部取消，軍委會成立，任少將參議，二十二年春兼調査統計局第三處長，二十七年改稱總務處，改組後，裁撤去職，因病赴港就醫，在港經商虧累，生活艱窘，因復返滬，擬就中醫，再作交易所生意，熟料不數日即爲日人得悉。丁逆此際，期艾反覆，對庭上之多方詰責，頗難自圓其說，乃請求「表白」幾點：（一）承認有罪，但後來戴罪立功，與中央聯絡，對犯罪行爲決不狡賴。（二）勝利後接收完畢，曾電軍委會辦公應賀主任國光轉呈蔣委員長，請依法處置無逃法之心。（三）罪行如係被吿所爲，自應處罪，但不是者不能承認，決非强辯。（四）有利證據，目的在表明心迹，使社會了解被吿總還有些貢獻，處之死刑，亦可自慰。總結言之，被吿雖加辯解，亦不狡稱無罪，悔過自首，亦非希圖免罪，請庭上切實了解，任憑處置，均所甘心；唯不能以道聽途說而加罪。丁逆「慷慨」陳述至此，爲審判官截斷。嚴詞語之曰：「丁默邨！對你有利事證，必詳實調查，自云有罪，未必眞有罪，自云無罪，亦不能就此放過。一切均以事實及法律爲據。今日乃是調査，有罪與吾，尙待確定。訊你爲何去港適滬。係詳硏動機，吾人只求明白事實眞象，你之一切皆將有充分機會使你辯護表白，今日無須多言。」丁逆唯唯，其轉移目標之企圖，乃吿失敗。庭上再問：「你在中央職務重要，雖去處長，猶留參議，中央待你不薄，何免不辭職亦不請　，負氣出走，在港生活困難，亦不返漢，而更走滬濱，究係應何人的你前往的？」丁逆仍　稱參議係兼職，薪水從未領過，保留與否朱知，港生活不慣，滬市中西醫均佳，對政治生活已厭倦。丁逆堅決否認係應約出走。</p>
<p>參加「和運」經過　介紹人名字推説忘記了</p>
<p>丁逆　供參加「和運」經過甚詳，謂係被日人及李士羣壓迫。並稱：渠素反汪逆，與汪關係極惡，但因脫逃無術，先爲李逆軟禁於七十六號，後由影佐主持之日本對華謀略機構「梅機關」之某日人介紹而參加。堅稱該日人姓名已忘却，在檢察應偵查庭上所供之「淸崎」係記憶錯誤。並稱，其時與日人之關係均須通過李士羣者，對「和運」之策劃很少，與日人談話時，絕無獻謀情事，「因大事他們找汪，找不到被吿，小事他們找李士羣，也找不到被吿。」據丁逆供其參加「和運」，係在僞六全代會甫開之際，以前靑島會談諸事均未參加，並反對組織僞府，且對「基本條約」表示不滿，均遭汪逆嫉恨。『僞方一切皆以汪爲主體，恢復「國民黨」，只是對付後方，騙騙人的，「中執會」及「中政會」的決議，都是汪宣讀一下，無所謂通過；更笑話的是：汪常先發佈緊急命令，再由「中政會」追認。被吿對此毫無興趣，開會旣不常到，故事情也記不淸。」於此，丁逆對「中日滿同盟條約」及吾覊重慶中央法令之宣言，均欲一句帶過。經庭上嚴追，祗得供稱：『是經「中政會」通過的，但事實只是聽聽報吿，如依法應負罪責，絕對承認。』庭上復論：「不要再拖罪拉責，要你說事實，須知悔罪後的態度，對量刑有關！丁逆復唯唯，但時時仍於狡辯不逞後，率然從旁認算。對英美宣戰事，丁逆稱；曾堅決反對；至僞國防會議成立後，未任委員，僅於仍然畸形存在之「中政會」中聽取「報吿」。丁逆稱：「自三十四年一月，因陣公博代主席較汪和緩，爲取得最機密之情報，供給中央，方就任偽國防會議之秘書長。」</p>
<p>老着面皮呼「冤」　把一切推諉於李逆士羣</p>
<p>旋丁逆縷供充任各僞職經過，詭稱均無事可作，並曾利用每一最小之可能，爲有利於人民及抗戰盡力。繼持辯護書，詳供「七十六號」偽特工總部之經過，狡稱：「先是李士羣爲日人工作，機關零星設立後，遷至七十六號擴大，僞六全代會後，成立總部組織，爲號召起見，李士羣自任副主任，而將主任名義加諸被吿，使無法洗刷，並遭軟禁；被吿逃脫不得，自殺不願，故無法拒絕，空頭主任，無委狀，亦無法就職，工作更難過問，此等情形，自不易爲各方了解，但有力量方能控制壓迫，則係淺顯之事實，請庭上調査被吿是否有力量。「七十六號」之槍械武力係被吿掌握抑係李士羣控制。後來特工總部改稱「調査統計部」再改稱「政治部」，最後改稱「政治保衛部」，陳公博兼總監，被吿兼副監，至三十四年五月去淅爲止。」所供各點，無非將罪行全部轉嫁李逆而已。</p>
<p>庭上繼讀本月十一日滬上某報讀者投書欄，前法租界工務局華董張翼樞所作「會經領敎過的丁默邨」一文，究訊其迫害愛國份子之罪行。丁逆辯謂：「文中有耿績之者，係李士羣的人，與被吿會過面，但無何關係，張係何人，不認識，無此事。」推賴乾淨。庭上再就被害人家屬檢舉之軍統地下工作人員鄭屛如小姐與同志等謀刺丁逆之失敗後，被捕殺害案，及錢岳兩法官被害案。丁逆或於謊言之後諉罪於李逆士羣及日人，或稱事發時間不在任期，圖卸責任，並靦顏呼寃，謂：「如說被吿是「殺人魔王」可立即處死，但把一切殺人案子統統牽扯到被告身上，實在寃枉，好殺人者神經舉動均與衆不同，請視被吿如何。」丁逆復稱：赴浙係奉中央命令前往，以作盟軍內應，「策反」，「防共」，對徵米，徵夫，獻銅，獻鐵，以武力凌壓人民諸惡行，極口否認。又對所撰「三十三年歲首感言」之謬論，亦不承認爲其手筆，且云不知何人所作。於此種種，庭諭均須提出有力反證，始可憑信。</p>
<p>提出了有利證據　竟然對附逆又表示痛悔</p>
<p>丁逆對突擊總隊事，供稱：『乃係計劃在「政治保衛」之下，建立「反共中心」會商得陳公博同意，及五月去浙后，即未過問，陳乃命萬里浪着手籌備，萬亦係進行策反工作者，但此事因槍械經費兩缺，終未實現」並狂妄大言：「突擊隊之計劃，決非爲日人作遊擊戰，老實說，被吿在浙東可指揮五六萬人，如欲有所行動，誠不必另起爐灶」。最後，庭上提出軍統局代電內述丁　自二十六年春至二十九年三月，任特工總部主任時，會捕殺地下工作同志十二人之多。丁逆矢口强辯其在「七十六號」爲廿八年冬季，爲時僅三月，在此期間以外，及上海以外之事，不能負責。庭上當諭提出有力反證，至下午一時半開始調査有利證件，丁逆乃又動悲，對附逆表示痛悔。旋由辯護律師薛　齊提出有利證據七類十九件來庭，審判官就第一類：「協助抗戰有利人民」之一「保全郵權維持通匯」，加以訊詰後，宣吿休息，時已下午一時三刻，整整四小時之審訊，巳使丁巡不勝支持，面如白紙，倚　喘息，其狀慘甚。　庭法官法警及丁逆與其律師等川膳後，三時十分繼續開庭，就有利證據加以審問。第一類二「整飭地方政治」，第二類「奉命營救中央地工人員」（一）營救吳開先·葛建時·蔣伯誠·陳寳驊·等；（二）鏟除李士羣，破壞七十六號；（三）建議偽府大赦。第三類：「協助抗戰有利中央」，（一）離間汪逆及李逆士羣；（二）設秘密電台，供中央通情報。第四類：「拒任七十六號虛名」，第五類：「未殺害軍統局之許克」，第六類：「服從中央執行任務」（一）通知岡村派代表請示投降；（二）協助接收。第七類：「向中央自首，呈遞悔過書」等，或有關係方面函證，或爲牽強曲解，均經庭上一一嚴訊，至五時半審畢，庭諭定期再審，被吿還押此一神秘陰險之魔王，已疲憊不堪，步履艱難，於暮　四起中歸囚。</p>

<h3>「魔王」初審點滴</h3>
<p>— 本報駐京記者　濮德玠</p>
<p>庭上嚴詞追詢其二十七年何故離滬赴港。丁逆說：那時肺病已近第三期，還有胃病心臟病，所以要去港就醫。復追詢其何故又赴滬？說是生意賠了，上海比較熟，想翻本；還說香港住不慣，沒有中醫中藥。如今在法庭上看丁逆，形容眞如三期T，B，漢奸生意可算全垮了。</p>
<p>從九時三刻開審到一時三刻休息，連審四小時，丁逆被審得面色慘白，連索茶水兩次作牛飲，軟癱地靠在受訊席欄邊上喘息。</p>
<p>主審官金世　庭長，爲留法司法專家，對每一題目，自各種不同角度窮比嚴訊，丁逆雖狡兎三窟，亦窮於逃遁，詭辯無術，全體旁聽者對金庭長審訊技術之高超，一致歎服。庭上訊問軍統地下工作人員　屛如小姐被害案時，丁逆首稱不知此人。庭上說：「瞞是瞞不了的，與其我問，還是你先說說吧」。丁逆才開始述說，先把鄭小姐的私人道德侮蔑了一陣，還說請新聞記者不要寫出來；後來就把賬目一齊寫到了李士羣和日本人的簿子上。庭上對其巧言令色，自欺欺人之本領，不禁啞然失笑。庭上問其學歷時，丁逆期期艾艾，說中學是在湖南第二中學畢業，大學住了很多個，可都沒有畢業。言下一笑，好似不好意思。亞洲社的攝影記者的舊燈泡又炸了一個（十五日國大開幕亦是此公表演），丁述先吃一驚，旋又作鷺鶯笑，此久經大陣之特務頭子，表示其已聽慣了這種聲響。丁逆答供時常說：「我很坦白地說……」「這是推托不掉的……」。庭上則曰「這樣曰就好，有事實你瞞也瞞不了。」</p>
<p>丁逆奸滑透頂，對時間，事實，常搪以「記不淸了」。庭上則總追問至確切，肯定，丁逆見計不售，只好裝模作樣，翻翻自白書再説出來。</p>

<h3>美援華會舉行宴會　開始募集救濟金　張平羣說明我正循民主大道邁進</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十八日電〕美國對華聯合服務社援華會（前美國援華會），今開始全紐約市募集一百二十五萬元救濟金運動，今晚該會舉行宴會，按該會本年預定募集八百萬元，今晚會上演講者有該會主席最近當選之康湼狄格州晨斯退丁紐斯，該會長麥克諾，中國駐紐約總領事張平羣，及最近訪華返美之基督敎大學聯合託事部秘書麥克穆倫。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十八日電〕我駐紐約總領張平羣，今晚在援華會宴會上對四百美國之山國友人保證：「中國政府之目的，在使中國爲一統一和平民主之國家」，現中國正循民主大道前進。張氏於聯合援華募款運動開幕時，致謝聯合援華會之美國支持者無限之帮助。張氏稱：設使中國人民能得在和平中工作之機會，彼等當能使國家走上軌道，並以勤勉及堅忍之精神，提高其生活水準，俾對世界繁榮有所貢獻。張氏論及美國若干人士對中國國民政府及國民黨之不斷批評一事時稱：此種責難，實不公允，因若千不良現象，乃由過去長時期形成在短時期內不易消除。張氏並促聽衆注意：「中國雖遭遇無數困難，實際上仍能多少從混亂中獲得統一，於不定情况中獲得建設。」至關於中國內部糾紛，張氏稱：「吾人深信除非中國內部統，中國之建設，實不可能，換言之，即先統一而後始能進行改革工作。」張氏繼稱：中國政府不能容忍共產黨，破壞交通？廢棄政治協定，以及軍事擴張而圖攫取國家大權。但張氏末稱：政府今準備續以政治手段解決中國共產黨問題，以求統一。</p>
<h3>社論　和談告一段落以后</h3>
<p>中共代表周恩來已於昨晨乘坐美機飛返延安，使十多個月來若接若離的國共談判吿一段落。回想起去年國共雙方所發表的「雙十會談紀要」，不是明明白白宣佈了一個共同原則的嗎？其規定國共雙方均將「在蔣主席領導之下，長期合作，堅決避免內戰，建設獨立自由和富強的新中國，澈底實行三民主義」；雙方又同意：「蔣主席所倡導之政治民主化，軍隊國家化，以及黨派平等合法，爲達到和平建國自由之途徑。」但是十多個月來，不僅未能擴大這個和平談判的基礎，而且中共政協代表團的名稱也不復存在了。追溯一下十多月來若接若離的和談經過，不知經過多决的波折，一忽兒柳暗花明，覺得前途大可樂觀；但一忽兒，又陰霾四合，頓覺黯淡無色，使我們作壁上觀的老百姓，幾乎墮入五里霧中，莫明其妙。甚至有時，啼笑皆非。到了現在，終算完全明白了，政府抱着容忍的精神，一讓再讓，先後曾頒佈三次的停戰令，但仍未能獲致國內的和平；政府對於國民大會的召開，也曾一再延期，終希望中共幡然覺悟，但是中共的能態度，始終倔强如故，不但拒不參加國民大會，而且千方百計，橫加破壞，使和談陷於破裂。所以造成目前的僵局，中共應負全責，是無法逃遺的。中共的執迷不悟，不啻自絕於國人，我們實在替中共可惜。和談旣已吿一段落，則今後政治的發展，自然要看政府如何發揮「盡其在我」的精神而定了。</p>
<p>這次國民大會，不問中共參加與否，已於本月十五日在京開幕，即足以證明政府對於還政於民，確實抱有絕大的決心。所以全國人民對於這次國民大會的開幕，無不表示熱烈歡迎與擁護，並深致無限的希望，即希望中國政治從此即能步入和平建國的新時代，惟這次國民大會的神圣任務，乃在制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，而新憲法的施行，尙待政府於國民大會閉幕後六個月內，依照新憲法的規定，定期舉行普選，選出國民大會代表，舉行國民大會實施行憲的任務。所以我們在這次國民大會開會期間，除了密切注意國民火會進行憲法的起草工作而外，尙須注意國府及行政院的改組。關於憲法問題，本報社論，早有所論列，終是希望這次國民大會，能制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，爲我國政治走上和平民主之路，開啓一個良好的發端，以促進國家的繁榮與進步。自不待言。</p>
<p>關於國府與行政院的改組問題，民主社會黨也以此爲該黨參加國民大會的條件之一；同時據政府代表非正式的表示：「改組政府事，正在醞釀之中，惟須在各黨派名單提出之后，始能與各黨派代磋商改組事宜，故在國民大會開會期問，國府委員會決可改組，中共與民盟之國府委員名額，仍將予以保留。至於行政院改組，以時間問題，須在國民大會開幕以後實行。」我們姑以常識判斷，也可知行政院長的人選問題，以及行政院如何擴大基礎等項問題，各方旣因國大之召開而集於一地，必能乘此時機加以商討。</p>
<p>論今日中國政治的積弊，不外乎兩端：第一是行政效率的普遍低落，不論在中央威地方行政機關，上至主管長官，下至科員辦事員，很少有精明幹練的人才，根本上談不上什麼行政效率。第二是貪污之風的盛行，以目前政界的情形而論，使我們益加相信，欲革新政治，則非從整叫政風做起不可。近來政治革新運動的呼聲，雖已　唱入云；但是其實際收效如何？　難斷言。人民喁喁望治之心，有如大旱之望雲　，實在太迫切了。但是從這次制憲的國民大會閉幕，到下次行憲的國民大會開幕，其間還有六個月的時間，這是還政於民的過渡時期，　府允應充分表現「盡其在我」的精神盡量與各黨各派共謀國是，並須自動改組政府，羅致令國的賢達及各黨各界的領袖，組成舉國一致的政府，不僅其行政應力求效率，而且還要造成廉潔的政風，以奠立民主法治的始基。</p>
<p>中國政治走向民主的大路，還有一個不可忽視的因素，這就是進步。民主不應徒務其名，而且也不是一蹴可幾的。要使政治逐漸民主化，就非在安定中求進步不可。惟我國是一個多難的國家，在抗戰八年之後，創鉅痛深，再加以萬般皆落後，國家的基礎尙未輩固，雖不能說在風雨飄搖之中；但祗少也可以說基礎尙未穩定，處於今日驚濤駭浪的世界，如何謀得國家的獨立生存？又如何始能與列强並鴐齊　？當非日夜猛晋，迎頭趕上去不可。所以我們希望改組後的政府，能充滿了活發壯健的朝氣，開創一個踐腹篤實的政風，肅淸一切官僚政治的習氣。我們翁了戰後世界各國政治的動向，益加相信中國政治也應該走上這條進步的大道。姑以英國政治而論，戰後舉行普選，工黨即能壓倒保守黨而上台執政，一年多來，工黨在內政外交上，雖然很少建樹，但是一般人民對於工黨，猶未喪失其信任的心理。上月英國內閣局部改組，又起用了好幾個年靑有爲的少肚派入閣，使英國政的又注入了許多新的血液，更加富於朝氣了。其次以美國晋選而論，共和黨競選獲勝的最大意義，可以目爲美國人民渴望進步的表示。同樣法國駁近普選的結果，共產黨在新議會中一躍而居第一位，其意義也就在此。所以英國內閣上月局部改組，可爲我國政府改組的示範。</p>
<p>要而言之，這次國民大會制度憲法，固然是我國　政開始的一大步驟，但是在過渡時期內　政府，應如何準備實施憲政，俾爲我國民主政治開啓一良好的發端，對於今後政治的發展，其關係實在太密切，太重大了。所以我們對於國府及行政院的改組，希望各方面考慮週詳，從長計議，務使改組後的政府而目一新，安然渡過這個還政於民的過渡時期，而步入眞正憲政的新時代，爲國家長治久安的百年大計，奠定一個　同的基礎。</p>

<h3>「叛黨」議員修正案否決　英下院信任政府</h3>
<p>支持聯合國機構爲外交政策其礎</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦特派員十九日專電〕關於英國外交政策應吾修正一案，下議院昨日已以三五三票予以否決，工黨議員多數放棄投票。首相艾德禮及內閣對此異常關切，因下院雖一致否決修正英外交政策，但事實上工黨議員放棄投票者的在六十與百人之間。外交界人士預料貝文外相將在紐約聯合國會議中對西班牙問題先發制人，以抵制蘇聯更强硬之要求。貝文或將建議聯合國大會於法朗哥政權被推翻以後，以經濟援助給予西班牙。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕下院昨日對外相貝文所行外交政策，一致表示信任。工黨議員五十八人曾提議，工黨政府外交政策，應在“蘇兩國間循中問路綫而行，表決結果以三五三票對零票被否決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕英下院本日開會，繼續辯論國王所發表之　書，席問由工黨議員克洛斯曼以「叛黨議員」發言人地位，發表演說，抨擊中美商務條約，並贊成修改英國現行外交政策，對於共產主產義及反共產主義均表示不滿。其言有謂蘇聯企圖將東歐各國列入其經濟系統之內，吾國政府爲此迭决提出抗議，本人認爲此舉極爲適當。但數日前中美兩國所簽訂之商務條約，美國在此一條約中，强暴地規定美國對華之經濟干涉權，英政府何竟不作一聲。此外美國並曾聲言，將保留其自日本所取得之基地，果爾則結果又將如何。余欲提出三項問題請政府予以答覆，（一）前首相邱吉爾前在美國富爾頓城發表演說時所揭　之政策，政府曾否予以否認，（二）政府是否已與美政府簽訂一項協定，擬使兩國軍備實行標準化，（三）英美兩國之高級參謀人員曾吾舉行商談。余確知英美聯合參謀部現仍存在，余又自負責人士方面獲悉，英美兩國現仍交換秘密情報，以目前之國際局勢而論，德日義均已投降，試問其搜集情報之對象，究係何國，果爾，則豈非在事實上已成立同盟乎？此事足以證明政府不顧其所提供之諾言，而依照邱吉爾在美國所發表之演說行事，英國必須實施一種獨立之外交政策，反對任何國際集團，殆可斷言云。</p>
<p>保守黨表示</p>
<p>保守黨議員克魯伊桑克繼工黨議員克羅斯曼之後發表演說稱，保守黨將繼續支持政府所採取之外交政策，但政府在德國所採取之政策，殊不能令人滿意。至於史坦伽特代表政府與埃及所進行之條約談判，結果亦難令人滿意，此外，巴勒斯坦局勢動盪不定，亦堪引以爲慮，但政府一旦發生分裂時，保守黨仍將投票贊成政府云。</p>
<h3>艾德禮首相辯護　否認組集團抗蘇　與美單獨締盟亦非事實　中美商約與美蘇所訂者大致相同</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕英首相艾德禮頃在下院中宣稱：余在未閱讀中美商約之前，即向人索取一份，經閱讀一遍之後，發現其僅爲一種普通商務條約而已。此與吾國與他國所簽訂之商的，以及美蘇兩國與其他各國所簽訂之商的，初無二致。此項條的爲何竟被目爲美國帝國主義之例證，殊難索解’中美簽訂商約，並非爲一國侵入另一國之例證。以言英國國防問題，有人以爲英國能在軍備上與美國或蘇聯爭一日之短長者，實爲愚不可及，吾人僅欲確保吾人之國防而已。吾人擬封聯合國機構有所貢獻。若干國際性之　會及經濟機構，雖曾竭誠邀請蘇聯參加，但蘇聯始終認爲非所適宜，故未推派代表參加，吾人豈能因此而不與其他國家共同建立此等機構乎？如若一個強國，均得在其佔領區內，選擇某某政黨作爲其「被保護者」則對於國際合作，必將產生不幸之後果，實無有甚於此者。吾人若能在經濟上視德國爲一個完整的單位，則局勢或已較目下爲佳。工黨議員克洛斯曼曾謂政府一味阿諛美國，而不願與蘇聯合作，此種論調，乃由於克落斯曼議員對於事實上之誤解所致，克洛斯曼議員所稱各節，均非事實。政府並不認爲東歐西歐及中歐應組織集團，或成立敵封之集團，吾人將支持聯合國機構，現有許多嚴重問題，美蘇兩國與我國之意見，固未能一致，但議員即以爲世界各國，正在組織集團，此種見解，實屬謬誤。吾人或較其他若干國家更易於妥協，惟妥協應爲和平文明之基礎，故吾人並不欲與美國組織同盟。以言前首相邱吉爾在美國富爾頓城所發表之演說，政府並未予以答覆，良以政府對於人民以私人資格發表之意見，並不負有答覆之責任故也。此外，又因英國軍隊現仍與美軍，共同佔領歐洲若干地區，故英國應與美參謀部繼續合作。要之，政府及合國大多數人民，現仍完全信任貝文外相，深望下院亦能確切表示支持貝文外相云。</p>
<h3>法共黨領袖　談外交政策</h3>
<p>須與英蘇成立協定</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕法國共黨領袖陶美士本日向倫敦泰晤士報駐巴黎記者發表談話，要求盟國團結一致組織共同陣綫，以防止德國企圖重整軍備，或在經濟上控制歐陸。並稱：以言共黨之外交政策，戰前曾獨樹一幟，反對所謂不干涉政策及慕尼黑之對德屈恥。吾人對於外交政策所採取之立場，尤其對於安全與賠償兩項問題，已獲得法國與論界之贊同。吾人希望能肅淸法西斯主義，並有效解除德國軍備。吾人認爲法國與英·美·蘇·三盟國成立協定，匪特有其必要，抑且亦屬不可缺少者也。吾人對於任何政策，凡足以促成集團之組成，均表示反對。</p>
<h3>託管委會　劇烈爭辯</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十八日電〕聯合國託管委員會小組會今日辯論時，印度代表建議使所有託管土地，概由聯合國機構本身治理。蘇代表諾維柯天主張將印度建議予以全部討論，伊拉克對印度之建議亦表示附議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕美代表杜斯今日在託管委會宣稱，委會之討論，「證明吾人無力處理任何事件」。其他各國代表多謂，印度之提案不過爲一種形式，依照聯合國運車，委治地若須移交，必須先得受委治國之同意，但蘇聯仍主張加以討論。蘇聯對於南非要求合併西南非及對於英國拒絕提出巴勒斯坦託管草的，亦均加以指摘。</p>
<h3>羅國大選聲中　各處發生暗殺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：羅馬尼亞人民八百萬今日舉行九年來第一次大選，各處發生暗殺，各黨派互相攻擊。據國家農民黨宣稱：政府實施恐怖，今晨該黨已有領袖七人遭暗殺。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅京十九日電〕此問人士今日聲稱：羅馬尼亞總理葛羅柴之共黨控制政府，是否爲人民所擁護，將於星期二國會選舉中遭受試騐。英美兩國則均已抗議羅國之選舉，豚爲未能充分保障反對派舉行自由民主化之投票。羅國軍警已有準備，如果選舉前民心激動致釀成暴行，即可出動彈壓。星期日羅京已有暴動發生。羅王米哈依深得民衆擁護，在此次選舉中不成問題。</p>
<h3>五強討論否決權　我提投票程序簡化原則　蘇聲明保留「拒絕一切建議」權利</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十八日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞，今日在紐約五强會議中討論否決權問題時，提出安理會投票程序簡化原則。顧氏建議在安理會程序親則內增添一項規定，即議程中事項之列入或删除，應認爲屬於投票程序範園而不受否決權之限制。該建議並規定某一問題之是否爲一種局勢抑爲一種爭議，亦應視爲屬於程序範圍。顧氏建議之內容如下：（一）在表決某一重要問題以前，應予以商討之機會，俾能成立協議。（二）某一永久會員國對非屬程序範圍之問題放棄投票時，不應視作一種否決。（三）議程內列入事項問題，應認爲屬於程序範圍。（四）議程內删除事項問題，應認爲屬於程序範圍。（五）某一問題是否爲一種局勢抑爲一種爭議之決定，應認爲屬於程序範圍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十八日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫今日在五大國會議以戲劇式之姿態，再度聲明不得修改或廢止憲章所規定安理會內之否決權，惟允考慮英美中三國提議自動限制否決權之使用，仍保留以後之反對權。莫氏並稱，使安理會擔負更多之緊文縟節，不知有何意義。可見莫氏堅決反對採納英外相貝文所謂限制否決權運用之「行爲規則」。莫氏對於　國提議大會政治委會暫停討論否決權問題兩三日，以待五大國會議從長討論一案，亦表示反對。惟　國提案卒以卅八票對六票，政治委會表決通過，另五票棄權。</p>
<h3>我國代表催設　國際糧食機構</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十八日電〕聯大經濟社會委會今日開曾時，各代表籲請組織國際糧食與救濟機構，以代替結束中之善救總署。中國代表堅決提議設立起草委會，立即開始工作，以解決糧食問題，良以此一問題爲數百萬生命所緊，未可延緩故也。</p>
<h3>尼柯夫繼任　蘇陸軍司令</h3>

<h3>英人心目中的中國</h3>
<p>— 本報駐英記者朱尊諸寄</p>
<p>〔倫敦十一月五日航訊〕最近有一位英國議員向我提出了兩個關於山國的問題：（一）目前中國囚戰方殷，美國支持蔣主席，中共則顯然擁有蘇聯的同情和援助，這種情勢發展下去，會不會演成第三次世界大戰？（二）目前美國　斷對華貿易，將來其他各國，包括英國在內，會不會被擯棄在中國市塲之外？</p>
<p>在一般關心中國的英國人腦子裏，這是兩個很大的問號。他們第一怕世界重又捲入戰渦，第二怕失去了四萬萬五千萬中國顧主。在渦去八年抗戰期問，因爲山英問根本談不到貿易，美蘇在遠東的衝突也沒有明朗化；英國人對中國採取的態度是漠不相關。一般人都認爲中國戰場沒有什麼重要性；戰事結束以後，靠對外貿易爲生的犬英帝國睜開了半隻眼睛，對遠東一看，上面兩個可怕的問題油然而生，世界局勢無論在政治或經濟上，已經够黑暗了，然而在遠東，陰霾的成分似乎更濃！</p>
<p>不平等條約取消後，租界已不存在，被視爲次殖民地的中國，已經改變了過去辦洋務，捧洋人的作風。過去的英國商人那裏知道有中國法律？那裏願上中國法庭？加上目前的通貨膨脹，物價飛漲，交通塞隔哀鴻遍野，因之一般冒險的英國商人不禁連聲嘆息，認爲世界完全變了。中國樂園已隨戰爭而去，中國的一切都已到了不可救藥的地步。他們送回來的消息，以及一部份折回英國商人的報吿，把中國描畫得黑漆一團。一批所謂「老中國」，更是咬牙切齒，認爲前途暗淡。他們心目中的中國原不過是上海各地的租界，租界退還中國後的上海市政，因之是他們攻擎的尖端，他們認爲中國不配統治像上海這樣的一個摩登都市。</p>
<p>英國報章雜誌所見到的中國恰是這些對中國不利的言論的一個例證。從中國來的消息，不是內戰，便是貪汚；不是通貨膨脹，使是災荒死亡。大部份讀者對中國固然沒有惡感，他們的反應不過是同情而已；但一部份同情中共的英國人便借題發揮，大作其文章了。</p>
<p>英國商人對中國市塲雖然是埀涎欲滴，但在目前這種情况之下，他們十九都是裏足不前，他們的態度是觀望。英國帝國化學工業公司董事長麥高溫公爵很坦白的說過：中國政局安定是英國帮中國工業化的先決條件，現在中國內戰方酣，經濟動搖，政府組織未趨健全至少帝國化學工業公司一時是不打算對華投資。麥氏接着自慰似的說：在相當時時內，英國經濟復興工作需要大批技術人員，無暇外顧。帝國化工公司是英國最大的化工公司，麥高溫的態度可以代表一般大資本家。（明日續完）</p>

<h3>輸入許可制度昨起實行　憑證報運貨物進口　同時辦理進口商登記　貝祖詒謁宋院長報告工作情形</h3>
<p>政府爲加强管理進口貿易，已實行修正進；貿易暫行細則，並在最高經濟委員會下，設立輸入臨時管理委員會執行委員會，該會已在滬成立，對於輸人物品實行輸人許可制度，昨日起已開始實行，凡在十一月十七日（即發表通告之日）前，業已訂購而尚朱報關進口之貨物，亦須補領驗人許可證，以便報關結匯，此項輸入許可申請書，可向各指定經營外滙銀行索取，依格塡寫，經審核批准後，即發給輸入許可證，憑證報運貨物進口，當局此舉端在减少非必需物品之推口，故此後奸商違法私運貨物進口將全力防止，除已由港務整理委員會警衛查緝組負責加强本市方面之緝貨工作外，對於華南方面私貨猖獗情形，亦將加强取締。央行貝總裁昨特派該行業務局長林鳳苞山滬飛粵視察，並與該地軍政當局籌商禁絕私貨進口辦法，貝氏本人不久亦將前往該地視察，惟吾國沿海海岸綫極長，奸商私運貨物進口，極難澈底取締，故當局亟盼各業商人能與政府協作，以消滅走私惡風。又當局爲加强管理進出口商起見，昨起辦理進口商登記，凡在民國卅年十二月八日以前業已營業或在該時以後營業而被公認爲國外廠商之代理人，或能證叫其有經營輸人貿易之能力者，均得中請登記云。</p>
<p>行政院院長宋子文，前日下午由京抵滬後，昨晨九時許即赴中行大樓處理公務，並接見翁副院長文灝，李度總稅務司吳市長國楨等有所商談，直至下午一時半方始離去。二時許，貝總裁祖詒幷赴宋氏私邸晋謁，對於最近在滬成立之十輸入臨時管理委員會執行委員會工作經過及推動情形有所報告。四時後，宋氏復至中行辦公，翁氏再度往謁，晤談甚久云。</p>
<h3>實行進口許可制　美籍商人談感想</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自行政當局宣布實行進口許可制度後，本市美商大部對辦法尚在詳細研究，經營非進出口業之商人，避免談及對於新辦法之感想，但以進出口爲主要業務者，有時亦坦率表白其立塲。記者昨日曾晤某大洋行之美籍經理，渠表示詳細辦法尚在研究過程中，但對中國政府此項行動有三點感想：（一）此項辦法之目的，在改善中國之經濟狀况，本身無可非議。但根據渠過去在中國之經騐，辦法與執行是兩件事，我人希望政府實行此項辦法，確能做到大公無私之地步。（二）中國政府前數月內，曾大量輸入無綫電器材，視之爲國民需要之商品。但在所辦法中，已列爲嚴格限制之貨物。渠個人之公司，並非以進口無綫電器材爲主要業務者，所受影響不大；但渠確知有若干中國小資本之貿易公司，藉此以營生者，新辦法將使其失業。僅因政府擁有大量無綫電器材，遂禁止民問輸入無綫電器材，此舉顯然缺乏公道。（三）除非將進口之限額明確宣布，並坦白交換情報，否則此項措置，固不能謂與中美新商約之精神無衝突。新辦法在短期內，常不致减少貿易總量，但在長期中，必將减少國際貿易數量。渠最後稱：彼之觀點，可代表火部份在華美商之共同看法，渠等在華多年經商，與中國已有感情，均希望能長期居留，一方面擴展本身之事業，同時亦願盡其微力，以協助中國之建設工作。</p>

<h3>英中華總商會副主席談　國內物價高漲　僑匯遠不如前　救國公債還本盼妥善措施　手工藝最受歡迎不容忽視</h3>
<p>頃據前由倫敦返國參加川席全國商聯會代表英國巾華總商會副主席李子固稱：我國旅歐僑胞，總數約計一萬餘人，留居英之利物浦者，的佔千餘人，倫敦六百餘，其餘散居歐洲大陸如德國，荷蘭一帶，則爲八千餘人。其職業以船員，餐館及經營洗衣業者，佔大多數，平均每週收人的八金鎊，開支約週計二金鎊，其餘則多存儲於當地之郵匯局，僑胞鑒國內物價土漲，普遍幾達英三一年所購之戰時救國公債成本問題也。按當時法幣與金鎊之匯當局當有妥善措施。關於國內政局，最爲一班僑胞所關注，此次。則旅外僑胞，均願返國，無論在技術上，資金上，均足助我工忍釋。過去日人深爲了解此種心理，往往仿效，冠以中國製造字樣，混跡歐洲市場，而牟厚利。吾國若推動出口貿易，此種手工　實不容忽視，且該地對此進口稅率，約估值三分之一，斷不如生絲之進口，需佔據百分之一百五十計算。按生絲進口如此限制，原因以英之人造絲事業，往往與政府當局人土有關，故而任其儘量發展耳。</p>

<h3>市長的諷刺　辦公室內一燈如豆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記得不久以前，記者爲了某件新聞，去市府訪問吳市長，市長無意中談到勵行節電問題，但猛抬頭，看見天花板上，却正炫耀地點着六盞電燈，連桌上的一盞檯燈，共是七盞。市長却打趣地對記者說：「我辦公實際所需要的，就祗是桌上的一盞，不知工友們却把天花板上的燈也都給扭亮了，好不費電！」昨天記者爲了某件新聞，又去市府訪問吳市長。在市府門外，遙望市長辦公室，只見窗裏是黑黝黝的一片，滿以爲市長已公畢回府。可是，經投過名刺後，吳市長立即延見。推進辦公室，吳市長正在他在「一燈如豆」的寫字檯上處理要公。堂堂市長辦公室，全沉浸在那支微弱黯淡的燈光中，這景象不一定是很協調的。可是，却正可給那些日光燈點滿廚窗的商店，或是電炬照耀如白畫的公館們，做一個有力的諷刺！</p>
<h3>明晨放警報　紀念防空節　大光明舉行大會　陳列巨型炸彈模型　慰問死難同志家屬</h3>
<p>本市防空節籌備會，於昨日下午三時半，在各電台廣播，請凡於民廿六年遭空襲死難之同胞家屬，迅往其居住地所屬之區公所登記，領取證明文件，俾均能參加明晨九時在大光明舉行之防空節紀念大會，並接受該大會之慰問，此外於民國廿六年在本市防空殉職同志之家屬，及在大後方防空殉職之在滬家屬，該會亦均已發出請柬，請參加大會。並將分贈慰勞品。該籌備會並於昨日函請此間空軍供應司令部，於明日在復興及中山兩公園內，陳列敎練機及飛行器材。在八一四我空軍出動大戰時敵機在外灘及大世界兩地落彈處，曁南京路，西藏路口等各要衝十字路口陳列大型炸彈之模型，以喚起全市市民對防空之注意。又該會於于昨日上午十時在警察局會議廳召開第二次籌備會，出席黨政軍警團等各機關代表廿餘人，即席決定：（一）於廿一日上午九時正，放警報，先放空襲警報，次放緊急警報，最後放解除警報。每次警報距離之時間爲二分鐘。（二）防空節紀念大會主席團，由市長•警備司令•市參議長•市黨部主委·市商會主席·憲兵團長，靑年團幹事長。空軍供應司令•海軍基地司令•地方協會會長及市府各局局長曁民政處長等担任。（三）請航委會於是日派機散發有關防空官傳之傳單。</p>
<h3>存煤少供應難　統制實爲必要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃走訪燃料管理機關，詢問本市用煤供應情形，獲悉本月本市煤斤之供應總量，在十四萬噸以上。其中公用事業佔六萬噸，鐵路佔三萬噸，輪船業佔三萬噸，煤業公會分配得二萬噸，大部轉售與小廠廠家。以價格而言，公用事業有關市民福利，特別優待，完全照成本出售，本月份每噸僅售九萬元。本市存貨，一共不過七八萬噸，萬一一北方運輸發生問題，尚不足供全一市一月之用。因之對於配售之申一請，不得不十分嚴格。至於煤斤之來源，大宗來自開灤煤礦，小部來自台灣。運輸工具自備，有輪船十餘艘，噸位均在五千噸以上。煤斤之供應，受兩重限制：（一）煤礦之產量，非且夕所能提高。（三）生產地之港口碼頭設備，已使用至最大限度，駁船在八年戰事中，損傷甚多，難以補充，亦减少港口起卸運輸之效能，能維持目前之供給量，實已盡最大之努力。目前煤之統制，實爲必要；因供給總量爲一定的，如有商人參與，旣不能增加供給，徒然因不能統籌辦理，使成本加高，使市民增加負担而已。</p>
<h3>船業界允派輪　協助運煤來滬</h3>
<p>本市輪船業公會，爲協助經濟部上海燃料管理委員會運輸煤炭，以接濟輪船及其他用煤，昨由中興輪船公司經理程餘齋，益祥輪船公司經理李志一等代表，與該會主任委員徐樂天，洽商具體辦法。經長時間討論後，輪船業方面，同意抽調大船一艘至數艘，以特別低廉之運價，常爲該會送煤。其餘輪船，如有空餘噸位，亦儘量協助煤運。燃管會亦實際充分配售，使各航綫之輸船，得以經常航行，維持交通。會後據公會負責人談稱，航運爲迫切需要之公用事業，其性質與火車電燈自來水等業相同。輪船業公會，爲减少燃管會供應上之困離，使各輪船公司能取得必需之用煤，準備由公會派船，前往產區，自運煤炭備用，並負責保證絕不流入黑市。</p>
<h3>招商局令各分局　查報抗戰期損失　加強運輸改築碼頭</h3>
<p>國營招商局，爲調查戰時損失，特製成統計表，呈送政府當局，俾向日本要求賠償，其在本市之調查統計工作，已將完竣。聞現已進一步調齊華南北各口岸該局所遭受之損失，除通令各該分局或辦事處人員，就地調查報告總局外，復將派員分赴尚未恢復戰前機構之口岸，實地調查，以便全部統計正確，而利要求賠償工作之推行。　該局爲求業務之推展，近將原有浮木搭成之砌頭，改築成鋼骨水泥之固定碼頭，以便利起重機及各種較重朮輛之上下，俾加强土下碼頭運輸工作。同時對各碼頭之苦力工人，亦加强管理，以减少偷竊及秘種之意外事件，至於倉庫之條築，亦下積極進行中，務使出入道寬大，空氣暢達，以便利貨物之出入與减少腐爛。</p>
<p>下月添闢滬菲航綫</p>

<h3>滬西大火災續聞　兩廠損失　逾九萬萬</h3>
<p>〔木報訊〕滬西惇信路潘家庫五十四號華豐橡膠物品製造廠，及比隣五十五號王德記廢花廠，前日下午五時許，發生大火，延燒甚熾，直至昨晨</p>
<p>全部灌熄，損失浩大，詳情已誌昨報。茲據警務查所得，斯役火警，雖至晚間八時半，大部已被控制，但王德記廢花露天堆棧，貨積如山，高逾數丈，施救困難，故逾十六七小時，始全部灌熄。結果所有廢花四五千包悉化灰燼。據該廠負責人云：因廢花堆棧保險費較其他貨棧昻貴，故未保險。而華　橡膠廠所保火險，據悉亦僅三千萬元，受保者爲上海聯保保險公司承保二千萬元，利華保險公司一千萬元。聞華豐方面損失約七億元，王德記近二億元，合計逾九億元之鉅，爲挽近以來之最大災，該管長寧分局將該案申解地檢處核辦。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕華豐橡膠廠第一廠突遭回祿後，茲悉原料成品倉庫，均與工塲隔離，幸保安全。該公司新近在江灣路購進第二廠，規模設備，遠較第一廠爲大，故出品並無影響。</p>
<h3>放長北站月臺　短期間內動工　京滬路間加強警衝</h3>

<h3>開口繪書　閉口藝術　高院初審女畫帥　李青萍能言善辯　供給敵僞情報答稱絕無其事　否認曾拜褚逆做乾爹</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕女畫家李靑萍（見圖·本報攝）由武漢　備司令部函請本市警局加以拘捕，李乃於月前在新生活俱樂部開畢畫展後被捕，解送高檢處偵查，以漢奸嫌疑提起公訴。昨日下午在高院初審，旁聽者甚衆。李多言善辯，滿口「我是繪畫，學藝術的一。堅決否認曾拜褚逆民誼爲乾爹，並否認會結織敵海軍報道部長松島慶與　田，供給政治經濟情報。全部詢問共歴一小時，庭論改期再訊，被告還押。</p>
<p>昨午三時十五分，陳振聲推事偕書記官升庭，即侖法警押上李青萍。李身衣翻領白襯衫，外套深藍西式短大衣，上綴貢色花紋，下穿黑呢西褲，香檳皮鞋，　髮，未施脂粉，手執白手帕及文件一束。陳推事首詢，其年歲籍貫及經歷，李答稱：「二十七歲，湖北江陵人，父已死，母在鄉下，無姊妹，有兄弟三，皆在重慶，父母均爲畫家，並無產業，　國二十四年畢業於　　　　，即在上海閘北安徽中學敎書，二十六年夏，因吉隆坡坤成女中徵求敎員，由學校派去南洋，則在該校敎　　音樂。至太平洋戰起，該處淪陷，乃由疏散華僑委良會疏散回國，於卅一年五月抵滬。　漢口，沙市回原籍江陵，住一星期左右即回上海」。</p>
<p>庭上詢以「當時往來各地，有何證件？」答稱：「並無證件，我隨時拿我的畫，聲明是畫家，來往亦就沒有什麼困難。返故鄉後，曾至宜昌，想進入內地，但必需證件，雖聲明是畫家亦不行，故回土海」。接稱：「回滬後借住上海美專，住二月多去北平，又去杭州蘇州，卅二年冬回上海開　展，住愚園路六〇八弄」　六號同學沈學芹家。四五月後，又去杭州蘇州畫畫，卅三夏又去北平，直至本年二月回滬，四月又經漢口回家鄉，住的二月，經南京開畫展，於九月二十日重回上海，住新生活俱樂部」。庭上開宮即問：「這幾年中你</p>
<p>來來去去是否與人相共？又在此兵荒馬亂中怎樣維持生活」？答曰：「來去都是一人，生活問題，因南洋回來時帶有儲蓄和手飾，加以幾年來努力繪畫，成績亦很好，故能維持」。陳推事繼詢：「到鄉下後，爲何不留下，而必欲來回各地活躍？」答稱：「在鄉下畫畫材料買不到，畫後亦賣不出去。我學西洋畫的寫生畫，故必須實地到各處去畫」。庭上問李曾否拜褚民誼爲乾爹？答稱：「沒有這事，在敵僞方面不認識什麼人」。陳推事稱：「此事有一漢口　局之證件可證」。李答：我</p>
<p>無此需要先父剛去世不久，故鄉亦沒有　幹爹這個習慣」。庭上問？「否則不容易跑來跑去？」李答：「爲什麼不能跑，當時繪畫的人很多」。陳推事乃問：「是否與敵海軍報道部之松島慶，　田相識？李毫不躊躇答曰：「不認識」。庭上詢李：「當時褚逆民誼任什麼職務？」答曰：「不知道，我是繪畫的」。陳推事駁以：「你是以繪畫爲名，打聽我方政治軍事消息，供給敵人？」李聞言是詰庭上：「是猜想的？還是事實？」庭上告以有</p>
<p>漢口警局的通緝函可體。李即滔滔答曰：「藝術是眞善美的，不會給別人利用，我政治常識沒有，連情報兩字都不知道。他們這樣來抓我，有什麼根據呢？請庭上問漢口抓我的機關，是根據什麼機關，什麼理由？」庭上又問李：「你自卅一年來總有些朋友來往，有什麼反證要提出？」李又洶洶答稱：「朋友沒有，什麼都沒有，祗有藝術！我不是開空洞的畫展，而是有作品的。賣畫時，並未收集過情報，藝術界的同志都知道我是繪　的」。陳推事以其</p>
<p>滿口繪畫與藝術：乃厲言斥曰：「檢察官起訴書並沒有說你不是繪畫的，衹因你有軌外行動，與敵來往，供給情報」。李答稱：「但是我沒有呀！」審訊至此，告一段落；李之辯護律師，即起立聲稱！「被告在南洋時，曾因獻　捐款，得過獎狀。現今政府官　，亦可證明被告並非漢奸。並有團人介紹她開畫展可證」。言畢即呈上有聞人具名之介紹畫展請柬等證件，李本人則要求庭上准予交保，陳推事答曰：恐怕不容易，我一人不能作主，必需具書而狀聲請，待合議庭裁定。李退庭與其表兄略談數語後遂由法警押回女監。</p>

<h3>敵僞時期　黑帽子　毆人致死案　高院復以漢奸罪提起公訴　蔣士彥仗勢行兇口口聲聲不知道　法官痛斥「壞東西」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣士彥，（見圖，本報攝）鹽城人現年廿一歲。上海淪陷時期，在僞華中鐵道公司任上海北站案內掛副班長，卅四年三月四日淸晨，在北站毆打女旅客徐佩文致死，此即　動一時之黑帽子逞凶案。蔣於出事後，畏罪潛逃，卒在戚墅堰被捕。由當時偽法院判處無期徒刑。勝利後經高院檢察官重行偵查，於本年十月七日起訴。在審理中，又因被告在敵僞組織所屬機關服務，憑藉勢力，虐害人民，有構成刑法第二百七十八條，及懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款及第三條之罪嫌，乃以漢奸罪嫌追加起訴。</p>
<p>該案昨日下午由高院邱煥　推事開庭提詢。蔣衣條子黑布短棉襖，藍布褲，平頂頭，身材短小，足穿黑布鞋。供稱：「鹽城中學初中畢業，於廿九年十月五日進僞華中鐵道公司任職」。邱推事即詢以「旣是中學生，爲何做漢奸？」答稱—「迫不得已，赴內地則因經濟力不够。」庭上乃問徐佩文被毆致死之事。答稱：「與徐旣不相識，亦無怨無仇。三月四日淸晨，本人在三號軍人買票窗口維持秩序，購票者徘隊很長，徐佩文未有排隊即插身中間，初加勸告，不聽。再去拖時，仍不肯。欲將她拖入站長室，不肯走，反咬我一口，我就拉住她領口，是時適遇站長日人三本前來，將她帶開，以後之事就不知道。」庭上問：「你用皮鞭打她，並用足踢。」答稱：「根本無此事，皮鞭爲軍人所用，我亦未踢她，此時站長已來，在上司面前，不能亂打人。事實經過如此，沒有半句假話。」‘邱推事即將被告以前所供之口供筆錄出示，蔣閱後答稱：「不對，完全虛構」。庭上又問：徐佩文被打傷以後怎樣？」答日：「當我離開時徐並無受傷跡象，送醫院之事，根本不知。」邱推事即稱：「徐佩文送上海療養院後，耗去開刀費二十萬，手續費六萬，向你要，你因怕事關人侖，乃向同事商借十五萬以作賠償。」蔣答：「根本無此事。」庭上乃問：「那你爲何在出事後要逃？」答稱：「並未逃走，三月四日出事後，五日六日仍熊常做事。七日請假去戚墅堰做生意，並非逃走。」問：「徐佩文死，你知道吾？」答稱：「不知」。最後問「還有什麼話要講」答稱：「完全寃枉，說我打死人，但並無證人。」邱推事告以：「漢奸都是壞的。」蔣聞言抗辯曰；「壞之中亦有好的。」邱推事即曰：「你就是壞的」。該案乃宣告改期再訊。被告於接見家屬談話時，庭上曉諭法警，因蔣爲殺人犯，須嚴加看管。待與家屬談畢，遂仍由法警押回監獄。</p>
<h3>市參議會　會址問題　政院已電覆</h3>

<h3>禁止場外交易　啥市昨日停頓　祗廿支紅奎星略有成交　第四次紗定於明日開配</h3>
<p>棉紗同業公會，爲實施取締塲外非法交易，曾於前日晚間臨時召集各理事談話，決定辦法如下：（一）此後各同業交易，一律均須入塲，如有故遠，在塲外非法賣買者，則由該會報警拘捕，並多派幹員嚴　監視，（二）各同業在塲內交易成交棉紗數量及報運，或本銷，或自用，均須於當塲成交時，立即　寫表格一張，該項表格，由公會登記，（三）成交數均由公會登記後統計，如報運外埠者，均由該公會通知紡管　核放，該項措置公佈後，昨日塲內沉寂異常，到塲人數寥寥，只廿支紅　星二百廿一萬，略有成交，餘無所聞，紡管會，於昨晨起，派員赴市　監視交易，寗波路棉紗市塲一一樓，已停止開放，所有一切交易，限在樓下成交，明盤行市無做開，聯誼社市單亦未出版，紗市呈停頓狀態，據公會方面表示，過去塲外交易，太在弄堂內成交，其居間人，均爲　外掮客，公會耳日難週，實亦無法制止，同時棉紗運往外埠，除華南方面須報請紡管會核放外，其餘京杭漢等地，均可自由裝進，由此而繞道運往華南，當復不少，塲外交易之旺盛，此亦一主因云。</p>
<p>第四次配紗　種類已決定</p>
<p>聯合配銷會第三期第四次配紗件數及支數種類，茲已結出。總額共計五五三五件，（此中紡建公司佔一四六七件）此中計十支九二六件，十二支廿六件，十六支六三八件，廿支二五四九件，卅二支三五〇件，卅二支雙股一一九件，四十支四七七件，四十二支雙股四二三件，六十支十件，六十四支雙股十件，八十支變股四件，八十支三股三件。以上各支紗，合廿支配額爲五八〇〇，六件（此中紡建公司佔二〇〇〇，五件）。合配給標準額六千件，（此中紡建公司佔二千〇〇一件）。</p>
<p>複配會解釋　退單之原因</p>
<p>歷次退單各方注意，第三次仍有八百九十七件，但其中五百件爲不合用之十支紗，係複配會於領到配表之日，即備函送還者，其餘之三百九十七件，則各種支數均有，據複配會消息，配紗之有退單、其原因有二，（一）複製品工業六公會，現共有受配廠家一千八百八十九家，每决配紗，槪按生產設備及開工程度之高下爲　，第三次因不合紗支之退回，及　報會員之併配，其各戶之受配數量，的爲申請數之五成，其少數廠家之因支歡不合用，或銀根不足而放棄者，自不免成爲退單，而其全體之總數，並非有餘也，（二）解款原爲星期四至六，第三次提前至星期五截止，事前未經紡管會及複配會接洽，以致臨時軋出者亦有不少，惟有一小部份經複配會商同配紗會，仍於星期六補收，複配會會向吳市長表示，黑市紗價上漲，而配紗仍有退單，正爲受配各廠不敢流入黑市之明證云。</p>
<h3>中信標售之面紗　悉交紡管會支配</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長昨語記者：日前召集棉紗各關係方面，舉行緊急會議，討論澈底消滅棉紗黑市辦法數項，決設法使之實現。至聯合配銷方面，廠商及複配會所感到之困難，現正力求分頭解決。至各廠配紗，必須符合各支紗之品質標準。如發現有支數不足，品質低劣等情事，其配價須照現行議價比例遞减。又吳市長刻已商得中央信託局局長劉攻芸之同意，將該局平日標售之棉紗，掃數交由紡管會支配。紡管會將以該局全部棉紗花色，支數，牌號，種類等，開列詳單，以便複製。品各公會照紡管會之議價選購云。</p>

<p>（二）自即日起，各指定銀行，對外匯由請人如無輸入許可證准其輸入者，不得對其進口貨物結售外匯，亦不得接受是項外匯之結。</p>

<h3>無錫糧價突漲　因浙省來錫採購</h3>

<h3>美鈔步跌金價平定</h3>
<p>烚赤昨　徘徊，晨開二五〇萬二，自二五一萬賣價起，仍遭壓力及浮多了結而趨疲，不久二五〇萬關，復被打破，央行配給二〇〇條，即以二四九萬七五之價配售，十時後求供不暢，低價會退至二四八萬三，始獲實銷維持，低後漸穩，近午形勢尙定，午刻在二四九萬五左右徘徊，午後極爲平定，隔日交割者始終在午刻價徘徊，結果較前收微降三千，飾金掛二十六萬四未更，紋銀平而銀元微降，暗拆息價在一角二至一角半之間」</p>
<p>外幣續吿鬆動，脫手者較股，市價步　，美鈔暗盤上塲即退爲四六三〇元至四六八〇元，賣戶孔殷，繼續降落，午刻跌至四五五〇元左右，較前日又跌百餘元，港票因申電報升至一〇八元，買戶見寂，吿跌甚多，結果較前收續挫二十元，港匯亦降至九一五元，印滙一一一〇〇元，英應一四八〇〇元，均屬賣價，成交祗港應稍有做開，餘均呆滯。</p>
<h3>美鈔將無用武之歟　關鍵仍在私貨能否絕跡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午美鈔暗盤，在四千五百五十元上下，成交者甚少。觀察家指出如進口許可制度有效實施，一面嚴厲取締走私，則美鈔將無用武之地，價格將續有跌落。過去數日美鈔黑市曾有狂漲，一度高至四千九百元之原因，據聞當時有外輪六艘抵埠，滿裝貨物，一批有資力之進出口商人因央行外匯不易請准，遂不惜以高價在市上搜購美鈔，投機份子乘機造謠，致價格空前上漲。目前則狂潮已過，新辦法實施後，美鈔之需要大爲减少。因過去之所謂走私，乃央行不准請匯而海關可以入口，商人即買進市塲上之美鈔作爲支付工具。在現行許可制度之下，凡准許進口之物，央行必能供給外匯；反之，不准進口之商品，私人雖握有外匯支付工具，海關仍不准其進口。在此種情形之下，即使政府仍允許美鈔在我國境自由使用、亦不　其興風作　，刺澈物價　。目前央行爲防止商業銀行經營美鈔黑市交易，曾　過銀行公會剴切忠吿，例如若有利用電話接洽美鈔交易行淸者，査出後，將割斷電　　。類似之防止方法頗多。記者　以大量　　美鈔之投機家，今後是否將减少，答；此　半　還用借來之　金以購買美于鈔，本身利息負担甚重，如美鈔市價長期平　　或竟　跌時，將感得不償失，勢必大量吐出。如此則美鈔需要激减而供給大增，價格將更　下落矣。</p>
<h3>公債步降</h3>
<p>公債昨交易閑散，，僅三百餘萬（成交，統丙晨　開一五五〇元，大戶求供紛　，但以環境不利，勢復領廢，步降至一五〇〇元內結束，結果較前收回跌一五〇元，甲乙丁亦跌一五〇元，統戊降落七十元。</p>
<h3>食油平價已提高　豆油每斤一千四百五十元　東北大豆運滬供榨油用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社曾局　昨日下午三時，召開食油評價會議，由社局糧食科長吉明齋主持。出席社局專員曹秉乾，　國植物油料廠李廷棟，民營　物油廠大有餘謝裕祥，爲民呂劍南，長德蔡伯膄、順餘何叔明，大昌，新周蔚伯，　糧油餅零售業公會及上海食油聯　處張超，　糧油餅公會楊明周等，討論至五時許，始吿散會。</p>
<p>吉明齋首先報吿稱：宋院長對滬市食油問題，極爲關懷。決設法以大豆供給各廠，並予各廠資金上週轉之方便。再另設法寬放各榨油廠用電限額，减輕各廠生產成本，並鼓　食油之販運。</p>
<p>旋即開始討論議價，國民營廠及販運商方面，均有成本表提出。經從詳硏究後，決定審議價格如决：豆油十三萬三千元，菜油十二萬九千元，蔴油十二萬九千元，淸油十二萬四千元，凈生油十二萬八千元，簍生油十三萬五千元。門市零售價格豆油十四萬五千元，菜油十四萬元，蔴油十四萬元，淸油十三萬四千元，凈生油十五萬元，簍生油十五萬元。至每斤價格，可依比例　推。例如豆油每斤一千四百五十元，菜油每斤一千四百元，生油每斤一千五百元。以上價格，自今日起實施。</p>
<p>又聞各榨油廠要求中央信託局將東北方面中信局所有之大豆二十萬噸，分批南運，以供榨油之用。現中信局已自營口方面起運大豆一千二百噸來滬，　計日內當可抵埠。聞各廠希望中信局能按每擔二萬九千元之價格出售。今日將推派大有餘廠謝裕祥，與該局購料易貨處經理何墨林洽談云。</p>
<p>聯合配油　繼續進行</p>
<p>上海食油聯合配售辦事處，昨繼續領到各民營廠配油四百擔，計大昌新八十擔，長德五十二擔，順餘四十八擔，大德新六十四擔，大生十六擔，爲民十二擔，以上爲豆油。大有餘則配出生菜油一百廿八擔。該處當將該項食油，分配於南市之食油零售店一百十五家，每家仍爲三擔半。聞自今日起，各民營廠每日之配售　將增加至五百擔。同時，爲謀普遍供應計，市府特向中國食油公司借到生油三千擔，交由該處普遍配售，今可決定辦法，的三四日內可供各零售店普遍門售。</p>
<p>該處自辦理食油零售店登記以來，登記總數，共爲一四二九家。惟該處以人手及時間關係，每日祇能分配一百餘家。故一千餘家零售店，將逐日分區分配，配前且有書而通知。已　記之”售商，先後均可配到，故未接通知前，可勿徒勞往返云。</p>
<h3>証交理事會就行　第六次常會　經紀人退業　又有五六家</h3>

<h3>米糧轉疲</h3>
<p>米市南北到貨共一萬二千餘石，店胃轉呆，止漲轉跌，南粳跌三千元，北粳挫一二千，秈米亦低千餘元，白元亦小二千元，麵粉廠方繼續售出，形勢看軟，雜牌續降一二百元，小麥平平，配油正在續辦手續，塲外市價亦在下　之中，麩皮未開，豆餅回疲一二百元，紅糧站穩，蠶豆去化不佳，再短千元，苞米靑島揀高拾取，微升三五百元，次貨呆滯，下降千元，芝蔴廣　進胃活潑，續見高翔，再漲一二千元，本街亦有進胃，後形仍趨挺秀，生仁南洋去路轉淡，市勢軟化少神，高貨尙定，中下回小一二千元，黃豆隨各物跟跌千元。</p>

<h3>黑白隊球運不濟　昨又敗於恩卡斯　卅七比卅九相差僅一球</h3>
<p>非島黑白籃球隊球運不濟，昨晚作來滬第四戰，又以三十七比三十九敗於西僑恩卡斯，相差僅一球，上半時恩卡斯以十七比十三佔先。市體育館內昨晚觀衆，的僅千人而已。前十九路軍抗日名將蔡祭廷楷亦蒞臨參觀。全局經過，尚稱緊凑，黑白自第一節佔得優勢後，奈不能長此維持，遂漸漸落後，但分數相差並未過鉅，惜乎黑白最後追成僅差二分時，時間已屆，徒喚奈何。</p>
<p>黑白先盛後衰</p>
<p>比賽七時開始，鄭志芳劉荷生任裁判，黑白以傅永信，林子儀，郭國業，李金造，許因珍，臨陣，恩卡斯出塲者爲却利勃脫，鮑萊，奧柴遼，V凱羅斯基，及格朋卡谷夫。接觸後，客軍傅隊長永信先開紀錄，林子儀李金造三罰均中，恩卡斯始由鮑萊獲一分，傅永信妙中，李金造破籃，九比一，黑白赫然領先，此爲黃金時代，迨番將奧柴遼勃脫連獲三分，第一節終，黑白以九比四佔優</p>
<p>第二節中，恩卡斯大見活躍，勃脫與鮑萊各建殊勳，黑白乃以沈仁壽調出傅永信，番將勃脫梅開二度，恩卡斯以十比九首决超出，鮑萊罰入，林子儀一射，十一平手，繼成各十三局面，勃脫單臂托人，奧柴遼建功，前半鐘聲已鳴，恩卡斯以十七對十三後來居上。</p>
<p>相差一球慘敗</p>
<p>休息之後，易籃再鬥，恩卡期以馬漢替出格朋乞谷夫，勃脫罰球先中，蔡金典立功，，番將V凱羅斯基射人，黑白呌停，以傅永信替出林子儀，傅入塲即二破籃圈，恩卡斯呌停，以E凱羅斯基代出V凱羅斯基，奧柴遼連取五分，黑白以葉克熙入塲，調出沈仁壽，未幾三節完了，二十三對二十九，黑白落後三球。最後一節，黑白李金造重行進塲，葉克熙下野，傅永信遠射中的，番將勃脫竟一氣呵成六分，黑白五次呼停，以殺其威，果見郭國業傅永信連投帶罰，追至卅二對卅七是時李金造五次犯規出場，林子儀臨陣，林長射鵠中，相差僅一球，恩卡斯呌停，格朋乞谷夫替出V凱羅斯基，鮑萊籃下托入，蔡金典亦立即即回敬，黑白正擬平反敗局，奈時不吾待，終塲鐘聲大鳴，黑白不幸以卅七對卅九，敗於恩卡斯。戰績如下：</p>

<h3>潼關內外鎖暗雲</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>十一日西安航訊</p>
<p>士卒何草草，築城潼關道</p>
<p>大城鐵不如，小城萬丈餘；</p>
<p>借問潼關吏：修關還備胡？</p>
<p>——杜少陵</p>
<p>京滬商談，全國大打；潼關內外，緊鎖暗　。民衆日益沈入窮愁的深淵，其悲憤抑　之氣，冲於霄漢。</p>
<p>北方早寒，雁羣南飛，鳴聲甚哀，於匝地風沙中，掠寒　而過。深秋已如初冬，裏裘不復燠暖。潼關舊這，鐵路搶修而出，材料缺乏，工程草率，　險萬狀旅者，備受磨折。記者經中原而行三秦，捨機坐車　越潼關，得分担國人之痛苦，衷心不無自安感，引爲一樂。自鄭州至西安，同車有交通部視察團諸先生，識聞廣博，奉俞大維先生命出巡各綫，記者乃詢以今日世界各國，有無鐵路如隴海路者？歉無正而的回答，而述及中國工程師之苦悶，則嘆無事可做。</p>
<p>鄭州至西安間五百八十八公里，車行兩晝夜，共四十小時，旅者　述困頓，車中寒氣迫人，苦不堪言，談及國是，相對嘆息，而笑聲隨之，至身受旅途之痛苦，則無不處以極端之忍耐心。殆亦寄沈痛於幽默之意。中國民族性趨於萎弱，非今日始啓其漸，呼淬厲奮發者，或未察及原因所在。危機處處，令人悚惕！車中有西北聯火學生，乃三泰子弟，感就業不易，至欲出國深造，亦復困難重重，記者即以「無事可做」相慰，聊盡相濡之意。</p>
<p>隴海路經洛陽，陝州而越潼關乃依伏牛山脈之崤函。終南山爲北嶺之脊背，伏牛崤兩爲其肢體。循路西上，地勢漸高，北瞰黃河，正挾濤奔騰北來，叩山東　，氣象萬千。史記稱崤函之固以論三秦形勢，即指潼關以東而言。過澠池，入陝州境，其間以張茅站爲經崤山之最高點，兩端上下坡道千分之一五，長達三十公里，交口覆車，旅客一百廿人隊谷中，無一生還，尚爲月前事，即在坡道上。軍人强迫掛車，司機缺乏經騐，而路基新修，尚在便道階段，遂釀慘劇。</p>
<p>此道上復有長一百五十公尺之便橋，渡越山谷，高達四十五公尺。用木材萬餘根，鐵螺栓萬餘枚，俱爲土產，螺栓旋紋不深，震動後最易髮脫，且按中外鐵道工程慣例，工程便橋大抵以長二十公尺爲度，五十公尺即爲至險，但此橋竟達一百五十公尺，復用以正式運載客貨。車行其上，顫顫巍巍，提心吊膽，雖路方每日檢騐，然事究有非人力所能補救者，一且失事，慘狀可以相見。今日爲趕通鐵路，由於材料缺乏，固有其不得已之困難在，但未聞交通當局有任何保證。此亟須質詢於交通部者。蓋記者察其地勢，並非不可改架橋爲大塡土，雖土方數目甚鉅，工程相當浩大，但在不能速獲鋼材架橋之際，一面暫通便橋，一面將大塡土開工，始爲保證安全之道，且其財力決不較用鋼架橋爲高。</p>
<p>鄭州一帶，隴海綫兩側，離鐵路百公尺處，正開始挖防禦壕，與鐵路並行，一望無際，其工程亦至浩大，我信如移十里之土工於此，即綽有餘裕。</p>
<p>隴海平漢，目前軍運最繁，幾達百分之七十。路上員工，動輒被軍人毆辱，甚至傷痛不起，軍人責鐵路腐敗，彼等稱軍人跋　。總之爲表現無法紀。沿途有站長上車報告已發生或正發生之事件，隴海員工待遇至薄，不及軍人遠甚。但彼等正以百分之七十的力量服務於軍人，遭遇如此，亦可休矣！至隴海路之腐敗，殆已定論。</p>
<p>車中有某軍軍需，聞九月份軍人待遇又調整，頗感興奮。但彼亦竟不知一軍每月經費需若干。以師爲單位，則有甲種師與乙種師之別，而各師之旅團編制，亦未盡一致。各單位復以性質與地方情形，待退亦大有不同，似欲求一標準預算數字，似非易事。全國八個補給區，十七個軍官隊，如鄭州一地，兵站補給單位即達二百六十個之多。去年勝利時一普通師每月經費現款一億六千萬，現經三次調整，幾增至十倍。如以步兵二百師（旅），平均每師十五億計，則爲三千億。再如高級機關，軍官隊，空軍，海軍，特種部隊，尚不在內。至糧秣配發，主食以麥子六十七斤爲單位，每斤二百元計，四百萬人所需即値五百三十六億，南方食米，價格昻一倍。但此爲實物，不需籌碼。雖規定副食及其他軍需原則配發實物，但今日中國尚難完全辦到。副食馬干等以現款折發，則仍賴運用籌碼。故此次軍人調整待遇後，記者估計，每月至少須多出一萬億元新鈔票，可無疑義。刺激物價，自有決定影響。</p>
<p>最近物價猛漲，正如西行綫上，地勢愈高，物價愈漲。及至西安，米價竟達十三萬元百斤，麵粉每斤五百餘元，政府厲行限價，聞係率准政院執行，何其西安情形竟有如此特殊—限價結果，已使西安造成嚴重糧荒，麵肉絕跡，配粉銷售，搶得頭破血流。今日西安，恐爲全國糧價最高城市。但離城二十里外糧價僅及其半，故操縱情形，灼然可見。此官商合組之平價會，使西安五十萬市民愈增物價之壓迫。</p>
<p>紅壤白楊過</p>
<p>中原黃土，關中紅壞，中國農業社會在此成長。中原淪爲戰地，民有　色，野無完屋，千瘡百孔，至難描述。惟關中則賴黃河潼關大塹，確保完整。記者嘗論關中形勢：抗戰中國共軍以其相當兵團對峙於陝中，敵不攻取延安或長安，不廢兵力，不增戰塲，爲侵華戰爭政略與戰略上惟一智舉。今日車過潼關，回首蒼茫，惟見華山雲烟，層層披練，窰沒　比，麥色青青，而紅壤白楊，　然凌空，萬山之有林木，亦勝中原多多。故關中淳厚持重之氣，仍不減於當年。然而人發貧愁，則未　於中原。長安人多衣裘過市，而道途所見，老婦孩提，衣不蔽體者觸目皆是。</p>
<p>晋西南之孔道，今日亦惟由潼關過風陵渡。晋省設施，閻錫山先生有其省本位的辦法，抗戰八年，局面艱難，仍能獨撑一面，譽爲永不撤退的閻錫山，實足當之。勝利後胡宗南部奉令過風陸渡入晋西南，共軍退却，著名之第一師躍然而進臨汾，重戰輕防，共軍乃調集大部，死力圍攻，該飾有重大損失。近月來，無大戰，同蒲南北，軍事聞已碰頭，東面止於浮山，而潼關彈丸之地，其擁擠有如抗戰初起之秋。</p>
<p>潼關以北，迤河渡口，俱可入晋西南，但交通不便，尤以雨後泥潭，可塞輪軸，關巾道路，大抵如此。晋省水利局長曹瑞芝，由渝至晋因雨道阻西安，與記者邂逅，彼率有黃河水利委員會一測量分隊，即擬山龍門口渡河，並順道勘測。</p>
<p>陝局晋局。其形勢似同於抗戰前一二年。聞閻錫山已實施土地分配及兵農合一之制，較普日之「土地村公有」若更進一籌；「兵農合一」係農民編組，保衛地方。每六人出一人服常備兵役，其家屬贍養及土地耕耘，則歸其他五人負担。地方亦有反對之者，但自仍按步實施。其在政治上有「民主革命同志會」的成立，閻爲會長。今晋人多已不呼閻長官而稱閻會長。凡此種種，記者以未獲其詳，不便擅下評價。惟以情勢所迫，往往有實際之改革，獨佔先鞭，最可足道。惟目前軍紀不掁，晋人多所詬病。</p>
<p>國人所最注目者，當爲陝中對峙之局，然勝利以來，各地大打，獨此一隅無聲息。蓋戰端之啓，肇於受降，蔓延所及，何知其不可燎燃至此？惟迄今無可報導者。南北來去，不乏商人，然皆爲偸運私販，自咸陽可通火車至同官，同官有煤礦，戰時隴海路闢此咸同支綫以供燃料，同官此去公路，雨後泥濘阻塞，正與他路相同。</p>
<p>至於陝南豫西人所關心者爲李先念部，現有一二萬人據於豫陝鄂之邊地山區，且曾迤秦嶺南麓，循漢水北岸至留壩一帶。人數雖少，但有一套辦法，山區地瘠民貧，正在組織發展，但未入川北一步。</p>
<p>重重暗雲環繞於潼關。昔日中原爲四戰之地，關中有四塞之險，東扼潼關而處巾原之上游，山西則建瓴於冀中，潼關爲其咽口，今日交通八面，空遝通暢，然而犬牙交錯，形勢不减。良將健卒，彙聚於千里之內，實不能設想和平完全毁滅後之情景。</p>
<p>記者抵西安後，渡　橋，游臨潼，登驪山訪虎叛石，探西安事變之陳跡，浴於華淸池，作一夕豪客。時滿月起於東林，寒光映水，山風澈骨，林木蕭蕭然，巡臨潼古城，惟數燈昏然，道左泉聲，百代烟雲，尚存夜霧。試思歷史曲折演進之道，無限感慨。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會上的　莫洛托夫</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>十一月四日紐約航訊</p>
<p>他永遠是硬派鬚生一般的角色。……從他乘坐的伊麗莎白皇后輪，泊上美國的碼頭以後，攝影記者　事訪記者，每天都跟着他走，連一點一滴會外的小動作，都一絲不漏的發現在報紙上。</p>
<p>在整個聯合國大會席上，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，無疑是最受人注目的一個，他的八面威風的「派頭」，也許要比維也納會議時代的梅特湼，比凡爾賽會議時代的克萊蒙梭，允有過之。我們這一代看不到梅特湼。克萊蒙梭的全盛時代，我還在幼年，但是，就我腦筋中的想像，我覺得莫洛托夫此他們更剛愎，更深沉，更盛氣凌人。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫厭煩紐約的夜都市生活，蘇聯代表團，化鉅資在紐約鄉下　了好幾幢華麗的住宅，那兒距福魯興會塲很近，開會的時候，比較方便。大會開幕那天，蘇聯代表團的汽車，一字長蛇陣停在會場門口，莫洛托夫率領着文武僚屬一大茶，進入會塲。攝影記者們幾十隻「開麥拉」，一齊對準着莫洛托夫，他的態度是那樣鎭靜。他不懂英文或法文，但是他端着那些英法文的文件，仍然從容不迫。蘇聯代表團，組織得像機器一樣嚴密。在莫洛托夫面前，葛羅米珂，像一個規矩的學童一樣，維辛斯基偶而還可以帶着笑臉跟他講話，但是，莫洛托夫依然是那樣道貌岸然。</p>
<p>爲了攝拉手鏡頭　莫氏再表演一次</p>
<p>安全理事會和大會平行開會的那天，莫洛托夫也親自出席。跟往常一樣，當莫洛托夫步進會場的時候，後面仍然跟着一大羣俄國的文武百僚。美國代表約翰生，從旁邊小門裏，獨個兒溜進來，我們的代表郭復初博士，很早就坐在會場的角落。（安全理事會的席决，是輪流的，中國和法國，剛巧輪在兩支不同的角落）。那天的主席是輪到賈德幹爵士，這位標準的英國紳士外交家，站起來跟莫洛托夫拉手，一大羣攝影記者，蜂湧而上，有幾位落後了一步的，請求他們：『能不能再拉一次？』那天莫洛托夫像是很興奮，他眞的又『表演』了一次。</p>
<p>買德幹發音重濁　由莫氏舌人傳譯</p>
<p>賈德幹的重濁的鼻音，在會塲裏裝滿了嚴肅的英國氣味。他宜讀了瑞士政府請求加入『國際法庭』的來信，然後提付討論。莫洛托夫不懂英文，年靑的碧眼金髮的隨從翻譯官，從後面伸過頭來，凑在莫洛托夫耳朶邊上，傳譯俄文。莫洛托夫自始至終沒有回頭，他的眼珠向天，微微頷首。然後想他自己的主意，他時時端起玻璃杯喝水，他的兩顆黑眼珠，禿了中間的頭髮，泛露着深沉，尖刻，乃至於剛愎的表情。</p>
<p>賈德幹褪下了眼鏡，把眼鏡脚像烟斗般銜在嘴唇邊。墨西哥代表捉議交付專家委員會審查，審查以後再作討論，這件瑞士的公案，就這樣算了結了。賈德幹鬆起屁股，正要宣佈散會時，波蘭的學者代表蘭祺，阻止散會，他的流利的英語，和往常每一次一樣的婉轉而有力，他又提出了制裁西班牙的問題。他說：安全理事會討論西班牙問題如此之久，問題依然沒有結果。爲什麼沒有排入今天的「議事日程」之中？蘭祺說完話，和往常一樣，帶着笑臉向旁邊的人回頭，但是，結果也是和往常一樣，沒有人笑臉回答他。</p>
<p>莫氏用俄語發言　買德幹顯有難色</p>
<p>莫洛托夫用俄語發言了。他贊成立即討論制裁西班牙問題，年靑的翻譯官成英語後，賈德幹露着非常爲難的神色。最後還是埃及和荷蘭代表轉團，決定了延遲三天再行討論的辦法，賈德幹問莫洛托夫，莫洛托夫沒有話說，祇是點了幾下腦袋。蘭祺又用漂亮的英語，說埃及代表的意思是：「合理而且是可以接受的」。</p>
<p>散會的時候，莫洛托夫第一個跑出會塲，斯拉夫的文武百僚，緊緊的跟在後面。當天紐約的晚報上，莫洛托夫短短幾個字，又做了「頭條」新聞。</p>
<p>兩位青年翻譯官　英語與速記俱佳</p>
<p>莫洛托夫對英美放大砲的演講，紐約時報及前鋒論壇報，都刋載了講詞全文，並且還刋登了許多演講姿勢的照片。那篇演講，是在大會上購的，向　用俄語講，再用英語翻譯。莫洛托夫帶來了兩位非常有本事的翻釋官，他不但要英文俄文都好，而且要懂得極成熟的速記，這兩位年靑的俄國人，較之大會的專任翻譯官，並無愧色。</p>
<p>俄國人講話，多半沈重，姿勢獃板而不失激動的力量，莫洛托夫也是如此，他的兩手老是上下擺動，而且是同一方式的　動。他講俄語的時候，聽衆因爲不懂得內容，祗是看他的表情和姿勢。等到一譯成英語以後，英美代表團的席次上，頓有緊張之色。</p>
<p>英國的副首席倍格爾爵士，坐在講台脚下，每一位大國（也有小國）的代表演講完畢，步下講台，他必然彎腰，而且熟誠的握手，祗有一次例外，那就是莫洛托夫走下講壇的時候。</p>
<p>最微妙的五十分之一秒鏡頭　可惜攝影記者沒有攝取</p>
<p>相反的情形是：莫洛托夫走過羅斯福夫人席决的面前，想伸出手去跟羅福斯夫人拉手，但是，道位美國的婦女領袖，並沒有動作，更沒有說半句恭維他演講成功的話。這一剎那是微妙的，最多算它「五十分之一」秒吧，攝影記者沒有攝下來。</p>
<p>紐約鏡報的記者愛德堡，坐在我旁邊，他說：羅斯福夫人雖然被目爲「左傾」，但是她畢竟是一個虔誠的愛國者。他還說：一個愛國的美國人，是忍受不了這樣公開的對美國的侮辱。愛德堡對於那『五十分之一秒』的鏡頭，看得非常淸楚。</p>
<p>莫氏很少鼓掌聲　對杜魯門是例外</p>
<p>外交塲合，必然旗鼓相當。當美國首席代表奧斯汀答覆蘇聯的演講發表時，台下有一陣陣的熱烈鼓掌，但是，莫洛托失並無動作。莫洛托夫很少替旁人鼓掌，杜魯門總統致詞，他是拍手的。印度代表潘笛德夫人講各國從非敵國的領土撤兵，俄國代表團熱烈鼓掌，但那天莫洛托夫沒有到</p>
<p>美國社會對莫氏　印象極度深刻化</p>
<p>但是，無論從正面看，或者反面看，莫洛托夫給美國社會的印象，是深刻到了極點，從他乘坐的伊麗莎白皇后輪泊上美國的碼頭以後，幾乎是每天，紐約報紙上刋著莫洛托夫的談話，行動，和照片，攝影記者和專訪記者，每天都跟着他走，運一點一滴會外的小動作，都一絲不漏的發現在報紙上。記得今年一月閒，第一次聯合國大會在倫敦開會的時候維辛斯基一時也做了英國記者們的對象，維辛斯基告訴那些記者：『請別老釘着我找新聞，找我的女兒去罷，她是一位能說話，能交際的漂亮姑娘呢！』那位維辛斯基小姐，後來果然發表了很多荒誕不經的談話，例如：『威斯敏士脫寺院的鐘，爲什麼這樣古？』例如：『我歡喜看白金漢宮門前御林軍的那匹白馬』之類，成了倫敦各報副刋及「點滴」或『花絮』中的好材料。</p>
<p>除引列寗言外　不慣於引經據典</p>
<p>莫洛托夫沒有帶這樣的公子或小姐來美國，他永遠是硬派鬚生的角色。維辛斯基演講詞中，每每歡喜提到屠格湼夫，托爾斯泰，高爾基之類，甚至有一天在小組委員會上大『吹』俄國的音樂，（俄國音樂，在西方社會是一向認爲非常有地位的。）正如同中國的夏晋麟博士，常常用流利的英語講述孔子哲學一樣，這原是可以調和會場空　的。但是莫洛托夫，從來沒有那麼一套。他有時也引經據典，但祗限於列寗或史達林的甚至列寗的也很少。</p>
<p>開會第一個星期的週末，我在一家戲院看電影，新聞片之中，又出現了莫洛托夫，戲院的左角，有七八個鼓掌的聲音，接着便有一大片「嗤」的聲音。這是不是算一個小小的民意測騐呢？莫洛托夫自已一定比我們更明白。</p>

<h3>新疆透視（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>新疆省主席張治中目前所處的地位，要算是亞洲全境最艱難的地位了。張氏苟能使該廣大區域裏的四百萬回民效忠於國民政府，則必建樹了政治史上的一大奇蹟。</p>
<p>張氏現正負起這一項艱鉅的任務，面臨着種種障碍，其中最大的障碍便是他的前身盛世才所遺留下來的。而盛世才十年的虐政所留給新疆回民心中的，無非是切齒痛恨中國當局的深刻印象。</p>
<p>伊寗事變成功的結果，在新疆西北部佔全省三分之一的最富饒區域裏面成立了一個回民的自治政府。叛黨於本年六月六日在迪化簽訂條約，同意西北三叛變區域應爲新疆省之一部，受中回聯合政府的管轄。但記者從各方面觀察，無從證明所謂「東土耳其斯坦人民共和國」有履行迪化條約的誠意</p>
<p>目前中國政府在新疆的軍事勢力以瑪那斯河爲界，該河在迪化以西七十哩，在此界綫以外，中央政府軍隊或官員不許越雷池一步。結果迪化的新疆政府不能從物產豐富的西北獲取煤，石油，黃金，穀類，麵粉，肉類，皮革等需要殷切的物資，而叛黨却跨越哈薩克斯坦邊界和蘇聯做着很好的買賣。事實上，大批蘇聯貨物取道回都伊寗自由地私遝至迪化，伊寗的回民甚至禁止張主席自迪化以西一百五十哩的豐富的烏蘇油田取得汽油。在迪化每加侖汽油的售價是美金三元。</p>
<p>伊寗叛黨擁有組織健全的軍隊，實力至少有一萬一千人，共計六個聯隊，騎兵與舟兵各半。</p>
<p>記者曾和幾個效忠於張氏的烏伊格領袖談話，他們都很爲張氏担心，除非將盛世才繩之以法，張氏欲收復人心，殊非易易。事實上回民已向新疆省參議會呈訴盛氏虛待民衆沒收民財，囿禁良民等罪行，要求依法審訊。中央政府在天山以南廣大的沙漠區域內仍保留着行政上的控制權，但烏伊格人因懷恨於盛世才，對中國政府同樣不表好感。</p>

<h3>英美蘇展開貿易爭奪戰　三個貿易世界輪廓　已逐漸在顯現出來</h3>
<p>— 南譯自「世界報告」週刋</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯自世界報告週刊</p>
<p>戰爭的魅影逐漸在消失，三　貿易世界的輪廓逐漸在顯現出來。</p>
<p>一個貿易世界正在美國的領導之下形成：美國是最大的輸出國，目前正把數十百億的借款供給其他國家，希望因此可以輸出得更多。另一個貿易世界則以英國爲中心：英國是最大的輸入國，現在正在加緊輸出，希望因此輸入得更多。蘇聯正在形成第三個貿易世界：蘇聯是地球上最自給自足的國，現在顯然在想成爲更自給自足。</p>
<p>所危險者，這三個貿易世界的界綫可能硬化起來而成爲壁壘，結果恐怕不惟得不到貿易反而有損和平。</p>
<p>英美輸出額的激增，暫時掩飾了世界分成三個貿易勢力範圍的事實。美國商業輸出的價値，已經達到二十六年來的高峯，一九二〇年的最高記錄業已在望。英國的輸出較預期者超過百分之五十，較一九三八年猶多百分之十五。</p>
<p>但是巴黎和會中尖銳的措詞，已經透露了匿藏在出口數字增加之後的恐懼和未來的困難。美國務卿貝爾納斯已經公開指靑蘇聯企圖迫使小國加入其自己的貿易世界，不准外界插足。他把蘇聯的作爲比諸德國在希特勒時代的作爲，稱之爲經濟上的奴役和剝削。貝爾納斯說：美國主張成立一個經濟世界，其中並無條約或謀略足以限制貿易和歪曲國際間的經濟關係。</p>
<p>世界貿易分裂爲三</p>
<p>可是貝爾納斯所反對的，事實上業已存在。在貿易方面，目前所存在的並不是一個世界而是相當明顯的三個世界。除了地理條件之外，貿易政策和實行方法的不同、使世界貿易分裂爲三。</p>
<p>莫斯科是一個貿易世界的樞紐，其中不但包括戰前的蘇聯並且還包括其他國家如芬蘭，捷克斯洛伐克，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，南斯拉夫和阿爾巴尼亞。蘇聯軍隊的實力輔以共產團體的政治活動，已經把這些土地拖入蘇聯的世界了。</p>
<p>出於蘇聯國內的復興工作，和外界實行貿易是有其迫切需要的，但是這種貿易的條件總是遵循莫斯科所規定的方式，私人商業極少機會，買賣都由政府機關辦理。同時蘇聯的政治左右着許多交易，而使貿易的性質變質。</p>
<p>事實上莫斯科所控制的貿易，數量上還是比較小的，照戰前的數字計算，僅佔全世界輸出入總額百分之七左右。</p>
<p>但是實際上的重要性却大得多。莫斯科貿易方面的成功將增加蘇聯的自給自足，而將加速其在政治上的孤立。歐洲假如和東部的農業區隔離了，復元的機會那就比現在還要少。美國所主張的整個的經濟世界，也將就此幻滅了。</p>
<p>美國貿易範圍不明</p>
<p>華盛頓是另一個貿易世界的樞紐，其範圍‘方法，和目的幾乎和以莫斯科爲中心的貿易世界完全不同。美國貿易的範圍是模糊的，大槪說起來，它包括中南美洲的大部份，阿根廷則爲例外，菲律濱顯然也包括在內，或許中國亦在共中。至于美國是否能把接受她貸款的歐洲國家納入其範圍，目下尚在未定之天。</p>
<p>使這個世界聯繋在一起的，是共同接受美國在經濟事務方面的領導地位，至少口頭上贊成美國自由擴張世界貿易的目的。貿易政策和辦法的現行不同，被認爲戰時暫時的產物。</p>
<p>美國的貿易範圍是代表自由貿易的理想的。在正當時代，國際商品交易中的五分之一在這一區域內流通，美國本身佔全世界商品輸出的百分之十五，商品輸人的百分之十。美國經濟情形的好轉或惡化，是和全世界息息相關的。</p>
<p>倫敦處於蘇美之間</p>
<p>倫敦無論在貿易方面或地理方面，都站在華盛頓和莫斯科的中間。以倫敦爲中心的貿易世界是願意支持美國的世界貿易政策的，但是還沒有放棄戰時反對目由貿易的措置。英國在簽訂英美借款時，保證英鎊集團，英帝國內的優先待遇以及限制貿易競爭的兩邊協定，一律都在取消之列。至於何時予以取消，須待英國斟酌實際情形之下才能決定。</p>
<p>英國世界貿易的組成，比美國的來得淸楚，其中包括聯合王國全部。戰爭結束前，英國和西歐諸國所簽訂的兩邊通貨及貿易協定，使範圍擴大了不少。英帝國戰前佔世界輸入三分之一，世界輸出四分之一以上。假如倫教的勢力能藉許多兩邊協定而吸收許多歐洲國家，那麼英國就可以代表世界貿易的一半。</p>
<p>英，蘇，美三國在貿易的槪念和方法上的鬥爭，目下已越出本身的範圍，而觸及若干佔有機要地位的國家。貿易的鬥爭正在演成思想的鬥爭。</p>

<h3>特港</h3>

<p>最近在紐約開會之四强外長會議，對於已持久未決的特港問題，仍無可以解決之象徵。</p>
<p>特里埃斯特港（Trieste），位在伊斯的里亞半島上，濱亞德里亞海之極北端，此地扼中歐出海之要衝，地位重要，因此義南兩國均極重視之，互爭領土主權，而蘇聯欲插足於地中海，英美欲防止其勢力侵入，都不惜作慕後支持人，在多次之國際會議中每每爭執不已，會增特港問題錯綜複雜之程度。</p>
<p>特港在第一次歐戰前，是奧地利出地中海唯一之要港，戰後根據凡爾賽和約，割給義大利，而今經過二次世界大戰，特港主權，究屬誰手，尚屬未定。</p>

<h3>英國外交的歧途　經濟恐慌已射下暗陰</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>戰後的世界，不論在政治方面或在經濟方面，到處暴露出捉襟見肘的弱點。美國爲了要恢復國際貿易的自由起見，在倫敦召開了一個國際貿易及就業會議，討論减低關稅壁壘的問題；同時又苜先發起，與世界十八個國家進行商務談判，欲與世界各國共减低關稅；但是美國的出口貿易的前途，仍難維持過去的水準。此在英國，也看到世界經濟恐慌的黑影，已投射到世界了，她爲了要預防這個黑影移到英國去起見，也在那裏開始厲行緊縮經濟的辦法。這些消息的報導，使每一個人對於世界經濟的前途，不得不有所憂慮！</p>
<p>在這一星期內，聯合國大會所討論的問題，除了若干小國因不滿意安全理事會常任理事國有行使「否決權」而要求修改聯合國憲章而外，還有一個殖民地的託管問題，也使聯合國大會討論了好久，沒有獲得一點結果。</p>
<p>小國主張修改憲章</p>
<p>聯合國大會政治及安全委員會於本月十四日開會，若千小國的代表，尤其是澳洲，古巴，菲列賓，阿根廷等國的代表，相繼發表演說，對於「否決權」，一致加以拼擊，並認爲「否決權」的存在，就是「强國獨裁」的表現，在此和平民主的時代，實不容許其存在。故一致要求修改聯合國憲章；但是在另一方面，這五個常任理事國，尤其是英美蘇三國，則堅決反對修改聯合國憲章，並主張將此問題，提交五强會議解決。當時大國與小國，各執一辭，幾乎使大會瀕於破裂，幸而中法兩國代表，以溫和的態度，提出折衷辦法，主張五强行使否決權以重要問題爲限，聯合國大會的空氣始稍趨於緩和。加以英國提議，將此項問題提交五强會議討論，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，也已表示同意了。</p>
<p>此外，英外相貝文又提出了一個建議，主張四點：（一）五强行使否決權，應以與其有切身利益之案件爲限；（二）不投票不應視爲行使否決權；（三）設法减少五强行使否決權的機會；（四）對於各項爭執，應予以明確解釋。美國代表已表示同意，中法兩國決無問題</p>
<p>特港問題已有進步</p>
<p>這次四國外長在紐約舉行會議，審議巴黎和會所通過的各種和的草案，本來是只許成功，不許失敗的。美國國務卿貝爾納斯也曾表示過，如果這次外長會議依舊不歡而散，則嗣後美國將不再參加任何國際會議。但是到了四國外長討論及對義和的草案時，最感棘手的義南兩國邊界問題以及特里雅斯特港問題，又使四國外長會議遭遇到一重暗礁。所謂特港問題的焦點，乃在行政長官的權限問題，蘇聯主張行政長官對於警察的權限，應予以限制，但是英美認爲，不應加以限制，否則就無法維持治安與秩序。後經法國外决繆維爾的調和折衷，終算成立妥協，惟莫洛托夫對於「緊急狀態，」仍要加以明確的規定，現已將此項枝節問題，交四國外次討論了，當然也不難獲得解決。</p>
<p>工黨議員不滿外交</p>
<p>工黨執政後第二屆國會於本月十二日開慕後，由英王發表詔書，首相艾德禮發表演說，報告內政外交，反對派領袖邱吉爾艾登之流，雖然也照例攻擊政府在內政外交上的失策，但不値得十分重視。可是工黨議員四十一人，突然聯名提出動議，反對工黨政府所採取的現行外交政策，而主張採取反對美國資本主義同時又反對蘇聯共產王義的政策。消息傳出，舉世震驚，不僅可以看出工黨內部的裂痕，而且英國的外交政策，正在十字街頭徘徊，也是非常明顯的了。</p>
<p>這個動議提出之後，下議院必然加以討論，但是貝文外相遠在紐約，出席四國外長會議，首相雖去電促其返國，爲其外交政策有所辯護，但外長會議關係重大，自不能分身，因此又不能返國，只好請首相代表；屆時首相艾德禮的處境尷尬，也是不言可知的。據報艾德禮首相將提出信任案，果爾，則英國工黨內部的分裂，恐不可避免的了。</p>
<p>戰後世界在分崩離析中，使各國實在太難應付了。美國的外交家早已感到苦悶，現在英國的外交家，也在那裏徘徊瞻顯了。究竟何去何從呢？實在需要工黨當局的縝密考慮，然後再作賢明的抉擇呢！</p>
<h3>和平交響樂</h3>
<p>當代大作曲家霍尼逑之「祈禱交響樂」，上星期　聯合國文化敎育機構之贊成，在法國處女演奏，允稱樂壇盛事。此曲於一九四五年完成，數月前僅在瑞十蘇黎士城奏過一次，此次由法國管絃樂隊在總統府大街戲院演奏，巴黎音樂界名流予以熱烈歡迎。該曲包括三部動作，用音樂曲凹描摹現代世界之戲劇性，人類之憂患，及和平之恢復。此次音樂會並初次演奏當代其他名曲兩支，即羅拜茲之「第五交響樂」與柏魯柯斐夫之「四畫像」。</p>
<h3>蘇聯範圍內的幸運兒　芬蘭自由獨多</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>芬當局爲民主付出代價</p>
<p>到過芬蘭的人，都覺得蘇聯正以緩和手段對待這個北歐鄰邦，因爲和東歐大多數國家比較起來，芬蘭目前所享有的自由是特多的。</p>
<p>這個國家並未由蘇軍加以佔領，附屬於管制委員會（設於海爾辛基）的若干紅軍士兵和水手行爲的並無疵病。</p>
<p>芬蘭雖然在二次戰爭中被擊潰，德軍曾留駐在其領土上達三年，而自一九四四年九月對蘇成立停戰協定以來即置於蘇聯擺佈之下，但是芬蘭人依然是自由的人民，在興趣上和行動上仍舊是民主的，但是也付出相當代價。</p>
<p>他們以較其他任何戰敗國更堅韌的態度忍受痛苦，但是這種痛苦是極嚴重的。</p>
<p>芬蘭的食物不多。肉類，食糖和脂肪的配給，離維持健康所需要的甚遠。小麥麵包幾乎無法獲得，裸麥麵包的配給不過勉強够用。今夏魚類和蛋類的配給制度雖已取消，但是對於大多數家庭價錢實在太貴。奢侈品根本買不到，甚至茶葉，可可和咖啡也包括在內。</p>
<p>雖然這種情形已經繼續達二年之久，健康不良的情形却極少，流行性的疫病並無，嬰兒死亡率並不增高，兒童並無嚴重疾病或營養不良的徵象，至少並不怎樣厲害。</p>
<p>芬蘭像其他許多歐洲國家一樣，也有黑市，但是對於一般芬蘭人生活上的影響，比較還小。第一，因爲祗有極少數人力能出極高的價格向黑市去採購物品；第二，因爲就是要買也沒有在在巾歐諸國那麼容易</p>
<p>衣服和住屋的奇缺，是芬蘭人的另一重大問題。皮鞋和毛織品簡直買不到，代用品也極少而質料惡劣不堪。芬蘭人有得最多的，就是紙，目前紙這東西對於一般</p>
<p>物資住屋均甚缺乏</p>
<p>芬蘭人的生活，起了重要的作用。在最流行的紙製「物品」中，有：窗簾，檯布，被單，圍裙硬領，鞋子和其他許多東西。</p>
<p>住屋也缺乏得可以，於是不得不實行每人一間的辦法，尤其在城市中辦得更嚴。</p>
<p>根據停戰協定，芬蘭人失却了貝薩摩和通往大西洋的出口；他們失却了海爾辛基附近的撲卡拉半島（租予聯蘇五十年作爲海軍根據地）以及接連海爾辛基和土庫兩大城的直通鐵路；他們失却了卡萊里亞省，包括經普里城，賽瑪工業區以及生產全國肉類和穀類八分之一的農業區。</p>
<p>停戰協定中關於賠款的規定，尤其嚴厲。芬蘭人必須在一九五二年九月前付給蘇聯美金三萬萬元，付款時必須以蘇方指定的貨物償付，便格以一九三八年的水準作爲計算的基礎，雖然有幾種貨物的價格提高了百分之十或百分之十五。</p>
<p>芬蘭人在宣傳方面並未受蘇方的限制，仍舊照他們自己的方法辦報或組織政治團體，其唯一條件就是不對蘇聯有所批評。</p>
<p>他們仍舊有選舉議會的自由，祗是防範和德國人曾有密切關係的人物滅入議會而已。目前的政府並不是議會喜歡支持的，祗是爲了討好蘇聯而勉强舉出這樣一個政府，但是這個政府至少不是蘇聯所指定的。莫斯科曾發給他們命令，要他們監禁戰爭領袖，肅淸警察等等，但是這種命令還沒有到過份的程度。</p>
<p>芬蘭人對於蘇聯具有傳統的恐懼，但是並不影響他們堅韌的態度。</p>

<h3>聽高芝蘭獨唱後　談中國女音樂家</h3>
<p>— 梁酉廷</p>
<p>聽了高芝蘭小姐的獨唱會，使我想起了下面這許多話：</p>
<p>有許多文章，討論「女性與音樂」，大都舉出好些例子，證明女人性格雖較男人更接近於音樂藝術，但歷史上獨少女音樂家。什麼「鋼琴之王」（李斯特），小提琴聖手（巴格尼尼），甚至於「女悲多芬」（舒伯特）的綽號，無一不是男性的。在歌唱中，歌劇中，明明需要許多女性，但「冠軍」總與女性無關。有之，不過是鳳毛麟角。這原因：我以爲並非女的音樂天才不及男的，上帝固無特別偏袒男人的理由；只因爲，男的可以許身音樂，拿畢生精力爲音樂盡瘁，甚至如悲多芬者，終身不娶，「爲音樂生，爲音樂死」，而男的即使結了婚，也與音樂的藝術生活無大影響。但女性則不然，結婚之後，藝術的追求，都爲丈夫與兒女犧牲了。正如我們這般職業青年，藝術的追求，爲飯碗而犧牲一樣。郎毓秀的「花腔女高音」，婚前婚後迥不相同。前些日子，許多人都曾在震旦禮堂或虹口文化會堂聽過她的獨唱，不能否認的，她的音量和音域已減到最少的限度，她的音色已表現得那麼微弱無力。現在她雖然仍要赴美再求深造，但這位幾個孩子的母親是否能恢復她婚前的美麗音色與嘹亮音量，卻難有把握。還有，女鋼琴家潘美波女士，曾一度與董光女士齊名，但是，現在已不復在樂台上見到她那靈活巧妙的十指之工了；她已是陳健華的太太，家庭事未免銷磨了她的藝術努力，生理上的變化，未免損害了她的多才多藝。雖不能說結婚絕對摧毀了她的藝術成就，但她所給予我們一種走向下坡的印象，不能說與家庭無關。像戴愛蓮，女舞蹈家，雖然嫁給漫畫家葉淺予，一對伉儷藝人，人生一樂，目前風頭都很健，但試問能有幾年？</p>
<p>很少的例外：女高音管夫人（管喻宜萱），並未受到結婚的不良影響。抗戰期中，在後方，她很走紅，不，不是「走紅」，而是的確由於拔藝之精而受敬仰，而得好評。勝利後曾在京滬演唱，那音量，那音色，那表情，那廣大的音域（也就是能唱到很高的聲音而猶應付自如），眞令人悠然神往，嘖嘖稱頌。我（以及許多人）都覺得她該是國內女歌唱家之首屈一指者。</p>
<p>不過，無論如何，女性學音樂與出嫁這兩件事，好比熊掌與魚。我不是獨身主義的呐喊者，但這是事實。要在音樂（特別是聲樂）上求得很高的成就，如果你是女性，那末最好在音樂與丈夫兩者之中，從一而終。兩全其美者，僅是很少的例外。有名的中國女小提琴聖手費曼爾女士，曾與一個空戰士結婚，婚前她的母親曾力加反對，爲了恐怕結婚妨害了她的音樂前程；抗戰中，她的丈夫在印度殉職，這又使她在「患得患失」的情形下，心靈蒙上了無限辛酸創痛，雖然更增加了她的藝術情感，但畢竟不利於經常的學習。不久前聽說她也要到美國去（或者已經成行），如果今後她能把孤獨的生活，完全寄托於小提琴的四根絃裏，也許她的成就比丈夫不死還要多些。</p>
<p>歷史上難找到女音樂家，但在上海所見，女音樂家卻也不少；除了上述的幾位外，還有陳麗清（很好的女高音），錢挹珊（大提琴手）等，都有着不可限量的前程。而高芝蘭女士，最近即將赴美的花腔女高音（應美國國立音樂藝術公司之　），也是一位黃金時代的女歌唱家，她是上海名聲樂敎授蘇石林（義大利籍）的高足，名師高徒，頗得好評，蘇石林先生很誇獎她，前一次在記者招待會上，蘇石林曾特爲介紹，說高女士是舉證一的中國女高音樂受美國音樂藝術公司之聘請者。我在細心聽過她的臨別獨唱會大致可稱成功。這位女高音，在勝利以前的上海，曾經在歌劇中任主角，上海樂壇大很熟悉她，市府樂團的夏季演奏中，她時被邀請，我覺得在歌唱經騐上，她不及郎毓秀那樣老練，但她在歌曲裏所表現的「力」，則遠勝郎小姐，僅次於管夫人。這次臨別獨唱中，她比以前數次更進步了。</p>
<p>不過唱到後來，也許由於聲響的疲倦，最高音部份，有些「沙沙」之感，這一點，在管夫人則不然，當她唱到最後整個精采節目時，幾乎每一曲都被聽眾要求再來一個，甚或再來兩遍，但她卻毫無吃不消之徵象。想高芝蘭小姐，用功若干時以後，必不讓管夫人專美於前。不過，因爲我們看到許多音樂家（特別聲樂家），受着結婚的不良影響，我想如果高小姐能夠此身嫁予音樂，其將來成就，必極驚人，將遠勝郎毓秀她們了，此其一；還有一點，現在音樂工作者們好像紛紛從上海撤退了，一致的到美國去了，不要「樂不思祖國」，荒蕪的中國樂壇，仍然極需要着各位的天才的！冒充內行，胡道一篇，不知對否？</p>
<h3>梅石</h3>
<p>— 梅蘭芳·俞盛明</p>
<h3>紅葉</h3>
<p>— 宣建人</p>
<p>—秋日投簡</p>
<p>我愛秋天的楓林。紅葉卻惹起我無邊的思念，因爲你採摘這一片紅葉，插在我的胸前，如一枚光榮的勳章。</p>
<p>「美吧？」</p>
<p>「美極了！」</p>
<p>說是「觸景生情」，人是許多空白的距離，彷彿劇作家玩弄人生，硬把「團圓」寫成悲劇的結果。我如今在社會舞台上演着一個悲慘的角色。還不知道何日能否一段落。</p>
<p>爲什麼我不能「創造」天地，另找一條路子，束縛我的是情感；我沒有勇氣把它割掉，讓它使我在人生的旅途上摸索。</p>
<p>摸索到什麼時候才能到幸福的路？</p>
<p>憂鬱的日子，我把採下的紅葉編織成詩篇，朗誦給無邊的原野，讓它能響在你的心上。</p>
<p>「我希望在心扉的空白上寫下我的名字！」</p>
<p>你嫵媚的一笑，把我的憂鬱的門打開了，陽光照亮了我的心扉。</p>
<p>「別寫詩了！」</p>
<p>嘉陵江的水，向長江匯流，波浪緊打在小舟上，我們在飄飄乎如羽化而登仙。我沉默，想用一句話包括我們的人生。想又想：呵，何必認眞的把人生猜透。</p>
<p>誰也不能把「愛」摘去，除非像牛頓看到落地的蘋果，才驚喜自然的眞理，我如今還在等待熟了的果實。</p>
<p>回到我的「陌生」的老家，因爲我不是生長在這古城的。這是我第二次回老家。</p>
<p>秋天的步伐，已踏到冬天的大門，紅葉將慢慢的凋殘，腐蝕。我記起雪萊的詩句：</p>
<p>「冬天來了，春天還會遠嗎？」</p>
<p>我已把希望迎向春天，在春天能有一個解答。</p>

<h3>痛苦的結晶</h3>
<p>— 馬超英</p>
<p>當我們把一部藝術品看完以後，如果我們把這部作品要加以更深的研究的時候，我們不妨先研究用家在寫這部作品時的一種內在的情感，那末，我們就可得到更深的了解。</p>
<p>從古以來的藝術家，他們的作品，大都是在悲極痛極時寫出來的，因爲人世間往往給許多偉大的藝術家以極壞的命運與遭遇，使他們在貧窮，飢餓，失戀和磨難之下掙扎；在他們掙扎的結果，就成就了他們的藝術。</p>
<p>我國文人有一句話：「古來至文皆係血淚語」。的確，裴多汶（Beethoven）的「交響曲」，傑辛（Gissing）的「貧士街」，施篤謨（Storm）的「茵夢湖」，瑪利龍（Morillo）的「丐兒生活」，路卜洵（Ropshin）的「灰色馬」，他們都是飽受了痛苦而抒寫出來的，他們這種偉大不朽的作品，都是血和淚換來的。他們嘗盡了人間的殘酷與哀傷，不過，他們的藝術已和日月同光。他們的作品流傳於後世，當人們讞到或聽到的時候，使人會發生同感，這就是成就了他們的「藝術的效果」（Effect　of　Art）。</p>
<p>所以，當我們看到一部燦爛的藝術作品時，我們不要只覺得這作品中是充滿着美與光，我們要知道，這是痛苦的結晶，這是在黑暗中得到的光輝，是永生不滅的。</p>
<h3>琵琶記的寫作地點</h3>
<p>— 天行</p>
<p>前幾月聽到「琵琶記」在美上演，頗得好評。最近看到報上宣傳，說是「琵琶記」已由田漢改編爲話劇了。</p>
<p>關於「琵琶記」一書，稱爲南曲之祖。與北曲的「西廂記」，是南北曲的兩大柱石。這個蔡伯喈和趙五娘的故事，本來早已盛行於宋代，當時詩人陸放翁有句云「身後是非誰管得？沿街聽唱蔡中郎。」高則誠就將這故事伸長其意，作了「琵琶記」的曲本。</p>
<p>高則誠，原名明，是元末明初；浙江的瑞安人。曾爲處州縣官，頗有政聲。後避方國珍亂，棄官隱居寗波的櫟社鎭，「琵琶記」一書，就在這個地方寫成的。我們的「鄞縣志」上，有着這樣的記載。</p>
<p>爲了好奇心的驅使，我特地到櫟社鎭去了一次，牠是一個小莊，村距離寗波城市約有十里光景，現在寗波的飛機場，就開闢在這個地方。村莊本來也相當繁盛，因着數年前遭了一次大火，焚去全村房屋一半以上，所以頗呈衰落的氣象。這裏的居民大多數是種田的，女人多能編蓆，全村的估計，大槪有一百餘戶，民風淳樸，沒有賭博等的習氣。</p>
<p>據他們父老的傳說，高則誠當時是住在一個土名石牆頭的一間小樓上，這個樓說是民國初年還存在，後來給大火燒去了，一位老人曾陪我去看過遺址，現在已作了柳姓的菜圃。他還告訴我許多關於高則誠的遺聞軼事，說高作「琵琶記」時，養了許多惡犬守門，恐怕有客會去擾亂他的心意。但高晚年很苦，妻子死了，又沒有兒子，住在這村相近的一個寺裏，依靠一位和尙爲生。終於不久，就在這個地方死去。就葬在這村莊的後面的小河旁，並無墓碑，只有土坵一堆，找不出什麼痕跡。不料一代作家，卻落得如此的結局！</p>
<p>這個村莊上，流傳下來每逢「燈頭」，（註：指正月十五夜元宵，）雇了班子來做戲，必演全部「琵琶記」。可是近年來找不到演崑曲的伶人，只有越劇來代替了。</p>
<p>高則誠的原籍，上面已說過是浙江瑞安，不知「瑞安縣志」上，有着怎樣的記載？我們的「鄞懸志」上，只說他避方國珍亂，隱居寗波櫟社作「琵琶記」。除了這樣的簡短的一段歷史外，就沒有別的記載了。</p>
<p>最近我看到清初一位劉挹峯著的「四明瑣記」裏，有一首高則誠所作的僧寮臥病口占的詩，我錄了出來，算作我這篇文章的結尾。</p>
<p>「日白雲黃欲暮天。</p>
<p>已無多賸此殘年，</p>
<p>病如簷雪消難盡，</p>
<p>愁似池冰結愈堅。</p>
<p>斬愛力窮翻入夢，</p>
<p>鍊詩心豁猛通禪；</p>
<p>老僧大有中山釀，</p>
<p>乞取深巵療不眠。」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　98</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>在「忠」字測騐下，大多是這一類的問題。呌你一時無從答覆。你如很漂亮的回答：「黑龍會的第一宗旨，就是「爲了祖國，寗再犧牲一切」，所以執行會委的命令，就是爲了愛護祖國」。這麼一答覆，你必定要受到其他更難於答覆的問題；所以難於答覆的理由，就因這些問題，如照理答對，所答對的，勢必與你前面的答案互相衝突。如若你不關前顧後，照理應對，他們這些執行委員，又必定認爲你的「思想顛倒，不合邏輯，」於是，你就不能受第二級「智」的測騐了。</p>
<p>那麼，最合邏輯的答案應當如何呢？你應當說：「執行命令，是會員的義務，有了執行命令之後，再受國法裁治，決不逃刑。」這樣的答覆，才算合乎「邏輯」。</p>
<p>可是，你如其如此答覆，他們必定問你，「刑罰是很痛苦的，你難道不怕痛苦？」你的回答，當然是「不怕痛苦」。很好。你就準備着受痛苦罷。他們這裏有很多科學上的非刑；恐怖類，都是仿製西方偵探應用聲，光，化，電，的各種佈置，拷問點驚罪犯的，你得親身嘗試一兩種同，或如慘酷類，好像歐洲中世紀那種慘無人道的私刑室，類如火炙，弔打，敲壓，鎖骨，穿筋等等，你也得忍受一下。當然他們爲了要留下你這「有用之身」，讓你淺嚐則止，不致折讓你的筋骨，然而也很夠你受用。據說也有會員，曾經受過三天水牢之災的，也有受過七天餓窟執刑的，那要看委員們對你信任的程度如何，他們的興致如何。</p>
<p>或者說，你第一級的答案，委員認爲「不合邏輯」，不能繼續第二級測騐，那麼，至多也不過不能入會罷了咧。那卻不能。何以呢？因爲你來參加這個黑龍會，無論自動或被迫，祇要進了這個秘密會門，你就已經成了會員；他們舊，你旣經來受測騐，就算跨進了門檻，旣經進了門檻，就算沿澈了他們會中秘密，所以非做會員不可了。只不過是一種「見習會員」而已。所謂見習會員，舉凡裏一切不層苦差，你都有份。當這苦差的時候，至少有二人以上的高級會員監視着。做得好，沒有賞譽；做得不好，刑罰很苛。如要想「揭誠」的話，你就算把性命交代了。所謂「揭誠」就是「跳槽」，或是「倒戈」，或是叛黨，那，你的罪狀，必是殺無赦！</p>
<p>會中這一類初級測騐不及格的辦法，爲「實地測騐」，所以也有在實地測騐中，積了功勞，而免除一二級測騐的辦法。那不幸的，甚至終其一生都在實地測騐中，也是有的。</p>
<p>其他，除了「忠」，「智」二級測騐之外，還有「信」，「堅」，「忍」三種，合共爲「五級測騐」。五級成功之後，在三個月初期新會員期中，就像梁山泊王仁對林沖的口氣，你得把一個「投名狀」來。這一點，一而是因製了強盜大王控制手下弟兄的辦法；一方面卻是倣效歐美秘密盜黨的規則；入黨會員，必得先犯一種殺人罪，黨首揑住你這犯罪的實據來挾制你。一時不聽調動，或是叛黨，他就把你這犯罪證據，送往警署，揭露你的罪狀。</p>

<h3>算盤</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>一個出租汽車的司機對我說：</p>
<p>「買汽車的朋友太傻了，與其，與其買汽車，不如雇出租汽車。」</p>
<p>我以爲他在做廣告，替出租汽車向我兜攬生意，我問他：「這話怎講」？地說：</p>
<p>「先生，你會打算盤嗎？假使你用一千萬元置一部汽車，以月息二角來說，每月就是兩百萬元，請問你雇出組汽車，每天是否要花七萬元，而且你有一部汽車，司機的工錢，保養費，修理費，汽油費，還有許許多多麻煩……」</p>
<p>道理的確很對。</p>
<p>頂房子也是同樣的情形，用四根金條頂一層樓，兩間或三間，不等於每月付二百萬元的房租嗎？但爲了置產買房子，上海灘目前還很少這類闊朋友。</p>
<p>凡此一切，都是高利貸在作祟，給果一反經濟上的原理，使川價値超過一切，鈔票不停地流動，凡置產者都變成傻瓜了。</p>
<h3>老百姓不好</h3>
<p>— 吳君</p>
<p>時事雜感</p>
<p>如今這個年頭，啞吧中國人頂好，敎你拆路，你就服服帖帖的拆路，敎你修路，你就乖乖的修路，不作一聲，即短短的幾句寥寥的幾個字也要惹禍的，據說敵僞時有這末一則故事，一個人爲了「多吃飯，少開口」兩句話，被敵僞硬給餵上三碗六鉢頭的飯，活活地漲死，那還呌人有什麼得說呢？</p>
<p>要不然，就四面打躬作揖，陪笑臉，眼淚只能往肚皮裏嚥，與是應了耶穌所謂：「人家打了你右頰，你就將左頰捧給他打」的心情，閱木報十一月十五日平漢北段前綫航訊：「涿縣縣黨部的書記長蕭佩蓀告訴記者，他下鄉去視察，竹問到老百姓究竟是共產黨好還是政府好，那老百姓哭喪着臉回答說，「共產黨也好，政府也好，不好的是我們老百姓；」他聽見幾乎落下淚來』。有誰能對了這一段不痛哭流涕啊！</p>
<p>老百姓的碗給砸了，住房給毀了，牛羊被牽去，鷄豚給宰了，田園長滿野草，一家人只落得四散逃走，流轉他鄉，却只能說「共產黨也好，政府也好，不好的是我們老百姓」。這不是此抗戰的時候更苦傷了嗎？抗戰的時候老百姓還可以痛駡鬼子，蘿蔔頭！</p>
<p>看了這三句，我滿眼都是淚水，多時鬱積下來時憤悶無意之間陡然給道三句呌破了，這三句的意思包含得太多了，字字是淚，字字是血，字字都是血淚換來的，而老百姓在血淚交逼之下，還只能說「不好的是我們老百姓」，我不禁要號啕大哭！</p>
<h3>英雄魚肉</h3>
<p>— 余十雲</p>
<p>翻開本國歷史來看，可以說寫盡「英雄魚肉」的事蹟。做老百姓一向是「英雄」們嘴邊的「魚肉」，愛殺就殺，愛吃就吃，算不得什麼一回事。</p>
<p>論語中的一句「民爲貴」，也是孟老夫子看透當時老百姓的太痛苦，遂憤然而言，促「英雄」們有所警惕。「寗可我負天下人」，曹阿瞞存心不良，但不失「英雄」之論。黃巢造反，殺人如麻，稱被殺的老百姓爲「兩脚羊』，比阿購之言，又進了一步。北宋靖康之　，全國「英雄」更進了一步，所欲者子女玉帛』，眞是要了「魚肉」，還要「穿戴」。明末流寇張獻忠李自成輩，造「小脚塔」以快其意，敲骨求金以取其澈，殺人要錢，已有先例可援，對「魚肉」不患無辭了。滿人入關，也抄老文章，可是「魚肉」有些不樂意，給果；演了齣「揚州十日」和「嘉定三屠」的連台戲，「魚肉」還是「魚肉」，俯首貼耳的躺下去，</p>
<p>在這「殺」的哲學保守下，「魚肉」也忍不住喊痛起來。「哇」的一聲！鼓足了五分鐘，做起民國主人來，阿斗第二，扶之不能立，操刀者接踵而至，半身不遂了八年，幸叨天佑，勝利降臨，學着大國民風度。「三日不吃飯，凸肚皮過橋」似的跟了別人充胖子。有些「英雄」們改了性兒，打起了「解放」魚肉「老百姓」的旗子，惜乎苦命注定！應了個「解放魚肉」的名號。另一些「英雄」們也在抹吃膩了的嘴，聽說不再以「魚肉」相視了，且自動的有「愛魚肉」組織出現，但不知如何「愛法」？從此「魚肉」可爲！做「魚肉」從此無憾矣！</p>
<h3>梅蘭芳的醉酒</h3>
<p>— 東名</p>
<p>梅蘭芳先生此次在中國大戲院公演，當年承華社的基本好陣容，除王鳳卿（名琴手王少鄉尊翁）年老退休，名武旦朱桂芳已作故人外，差不多全部被邀請來了，難能可貴的是年逾古稀的蕭長華也在台上恢復了合作。</p>
<p>聽說梅博士應各界一再熱烈要求，要貼「貴妃醉酒」了，這可說是一個驚人消息！醉酒這齣戲非唱，念，做，表，四難併不行，環顧南北名伶中，這十年來敢一動醉酒的少如鳳毛麟角，即便動，也够不上前述四個條件。</p>
<p>梅博士的醉酒來頭很大；一舉手，一抬腿，都是規矩，都有來歷。酒醉後的神態，更非任何名角可與比擬，更何况梅先生是飾楊貴妃最適合的一位人物啊！</p>
<p>梅氏在此劇中的唱，允稱一絕，實盡脆，甜，嬌媚之能事，加以當代琴界翹楚徐蘭沅王少卿的胡琴，尤其是少卿的二胡，允稱空前絕後，此戲排子最多，內外行均視爲畏途。徐王二位在此劇中用的排子，很多是快將失傳了的好牌子，例如：回回曲，鬥蟬蟋等。　梅先生未演醉酒，已經十餘年了。上决最後看他一次醉酒，是在大舞台，當時印象歷歷如繪，但若干年間，也祗看過他這一次而已，所以梅先生的「醉酒」可說非常名貴，眞是輕易不漏。此番連唱半個多月，無塲不滿，他的「身上」比從前更好，想到他年越半百的人，還如此進步不懈，眞令人欽佩不置。聯想到他「醉酒」的「身上」一定美妙到極點。又梅先生爲這齣規矩將盡失去的骨子老戲，不惜累工而搬了上台，對於後進者，是最好的揣摹機會，切勿錯過了。</p>
<h3>中國輸出品</h3>
<p>— 寒蟬</p>
<p>敎室中正在上着地理課，所講的是中國的對外貿易。學生王某聰得不耐煩了，向着窗外的天空呆看。</p>
<p>「××：你可知道在今日的中國，輸出品以什麼爲最宜？」</p>
<p>王某突然被先生喊了起來，連問句也沒聽淸楚。</p>
<p>「你只須把中國最不需要的，而最多的東西說出來就够了。」先生惟恐他不能明瞭題意，所以又代他解釋了一下。</p>
<p>「那……只有貪污。」</p>
<h3>娃娃日記</h3>
<p>— 張契渠</p>
<p>難養在那裏</p>
<p>昨天，因爲生活問題，爸爸與媽媽吵了一架。今天平上，爸爸像書呆子似的一個人在幌着腦袋唱道：『惟女子與小人爲難養也。』爸爸此話，原是發發牢騷而已。不意竟爲媽媽聽到，立生大波，認爲是莫大的侮辱。菜也不切了，飯也不煮了。非要與他算帳不可。問他難養在那裏？『同樣一個女人，別人有美齡號飛機，到處飛。咱們也是女人，跟你這呌化子不如的男人三餐米飯不繼。四季衣衫不全，住房子還要被房東控告咱們非法佔住。坐電車還被人家說我們揩油，我有什麼難養？什麼難養？』</p>
<p>爸爸自覺理虧，但爲面子關係，不便服輸。還是支吾着說：女子與小人之難養，有註解，並不是說她們的物質生活供養不起，是說他們『遠之則怨，近之則不遜」。比如隔壁那位淪陷夫人，當他丈夫在後方時，她天天「怨』着他不回來，如今帶着一位抗戰夫人回來了，她又絕不「遜」讓。這不是難養嗎？</p>
<p>媽媽見他胡說八道，明知他自覺理虧，也就冷笑一聲，不再計較了。但我心中却頗覺憤懣，因爲爸爸所舉的例，眞是滿口胡說！</p>
<p>不過，關於「小人」部份，不能不有所表示。大槪：小人有三種解釋，一種是形態的，一種是年齡的，一種是人格的。聖人所謂女子與小人，是第三種人而言也。第一種是矮子，重慶中山公園動物院收門票的是也；第二種即我，小朋友輩也。此二者皆非難養之屬，所以我大可不必興問罪之師。</p>
<p>無辜的殺人犯　心理分析家的故事　許桂庭</p>
<p>警長問：「這個傢伙到底怎樣爬到這樣高的地方去呀？」他憂鬱地注視着那所屹立入雲的大厦。那個年輕的警官答：「那裏是一條避火梯。他一定是從那裏走上去的。」</p>
<p>「那麼，他一定是發神經病的了，」警長毫無表情地說，「這是毫無疑惑的了。」</p>
<p>米恩插口說：「我以爲他也許會跳下來呢。」</p>
<p>警長縮一縮肩頭說：「如果他跳下來的話，那就省掉我們走上去抓他的力氣了。」</p>
<p>「那麼，你能够想出辦法抓他下來嗎？」</p>
<p>「消防隊的朋友總會想出辦法的。他們馬上就要來了。」</p>
<p>天快亮了，米恩已經看見了在上面魯遜的背後。他似乎靜靜地坐在那裏，頭靠着牆。在上面，他似乎渺小得很，而且有些孤獨凄凉的樣子。米恩突然下一決心：「我一定要走上去，和他下來。」</p>
<p>「不，你不能這樣做，」警長很不耐煩地說：「我決不准許任何一個人爲了他而跌斷了頸，而且他也許會向你開槍呢。」</p>
<p>「我想他不會向我開槍罷，」米恩說，「我也許能够弄他下來。眞對不起，警長。我決不能讓他站在那裏，他是我的病人。如果我起初不讓他走，這樣事情決不會發生的。」</p>
<p>警長聽了，祇好搖搖頭，說：「好罷，但是……」</p>
<p>救火車的鐘聲響了。那個警官說：「他們來了。他們也帶了梯子。」</p>
<p>消防隊的指揮員對米恩說：「喂，朋友。爬梯子不是好玩的。要爬得慢而且鎭定。記着，你走到一半喜歡休息的時候也可以休息的，不過千萬不要朝下看。當你停止向上爬的時候，不要忘記把皮帶綁緊你的身體！」</p>
<p>米恩不管一切的向上爬。</p>
<p>消防員很高興地說：「他也許能够爬上去呢。他竟然有這樣的胆子去嘗試啊。」</p>
<p>「噢，他的確有胆子，」警長埀頭喪氣地說，「但是可不要忘記，上面那個傢伙却有着一枝手槍啊！」</p>
<p>米恩一向是害怕走到高的地方去的。因爲害怕的緣故，他把身體緊緊地靠着梯子，爬上去的時候，速他的膝頭都沒有空位來彎曲。但是，他已經開始爬了，那麼，總要幹到底了。可是，他忘記了消防員的關照，拼命的快爬，結果爬到一牛就氣喘如牛，覺得非常疲倦。他祗好停了一會兒。在道個短時期間，他險些兒就鑄成一失足成千古恨的大錯，因爲他在休息的時候，順眼朝下看了一看。天啊，米恩簡直嚇得面無人色，除了雙手緊握梯子之外，一動也動不來，他祇好把眼睛緊閉起來，拼命向上爬。（明日續完）</p>

<h3>The Complete Constitution Draft Review is Finished, Submitted to the Central Executive Committee and National Defense Council for Discussion, and then Presented to the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Constitution Draft Review Committee held its second meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 3:00 PM on the 19th. Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Lin Bin, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junmai, Wang Yunwu, and Miao Jiaming attended and thoroughly discussed the unfinished parts of yesterday's review. Lei Zhen also participated. It is reported that the meeting went well, and there were no changes in principle, but because the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, everyone sought perfection and scrutinized the wording until 6:00 PM. It is said that the entire review was completed on the 19th and it will be submitted to the Central Executive Committee for discussion on the morning of the 20th, and to the Supreme National Defense Council for discussion in the afternoon. It will then be submitted to the Legislative Yuan on the 21st to complete the legislative process, and then submitted to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] During the Constitution Draft Review Committee meeting on the 19th, the most important additions or deletions to the revised draft were the following: Under Article 45 of the chapter on the President, the following was added: "Regarding disputes between the Yuan, the President may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuan to discuss and resolve them, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution." At the meeting, all parties felt that it was necessary to add this article to the Constitution, because the revised draft did not have proper provisions for the connection between the five Yuan. In the event of a dispute between Yuan A and Yuan B, if there is no way to resolve the difficulties, the government may fall into a deadlock. Adding this article can avoid this drawback. The revised draft of the chapter on the Executive Yuan did not specify how the heads of the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan should be appointed. The attendees agreed that this point should be stipulated in the Constitution, and it was agreed to add: "The heads of the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan and the ministers without portfolio shall be nominated by the President of the Executive Yuan and appointed by the President." In the revised draft of the chapter on the Central and Local Governments, the word "county" was added after the word "province" in Article 108, "The following matters shall be legislated and implemented by the Central Government or delegated to the provinces for execution," and changed to "executed by the provinces and counties," and the following clause was added: "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy." If so, when the provinces formulate provincial autonomy laws in the future, they must be based on the "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy." Although the county is not a "local autonomous unit," its autonomous characteristics are also more obvious than in the revised draft. In the chapter on Basic National Policies, the participants agreed to add the eight characters "national morality and sound physique" under Article 140 of the revised draft "Cultural education should develop the national spirit and the people's livelihood spirit of the people," and the last five characters "as the basic principle" of the article were also deleted. Regarding the implementation and amendment of the Constitution in the revised draft, the original "Item 2" of Article "144" stated, "If there is any conflict between the law and the Constitution, the Executive Yuan shall, within six months after the law comes into effect, request the Judicial Yuan for interpretation." According to this provision, it can be submitted to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation after being submitted by the Executive Yuan, and it is stipulated that the interpretation can only be requested within six months after implementation, which has great drawbacks. It was agreed in the meeting to change it to "If there is any doubt about whether the current laws conflict with the Constitution, the Judicial Yuan shall interpret it." It is not stipulated that it should be submitted by the Executive Yuan, nor is it limited to a certain period "after implementation," which is more appropriate. At the meeting, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan was also discussed, but no changes were made to the revised draft. The Supervisory Yuan, which everyone paid attention to, and the consent power of the Legislative Yuan, were proposed to be abolished by some people at the meeting, but no agreement was reached. According to a participant in the meeting, if the President can appoint the President of the Executive Yuan and the President of the Judicial Yuan without the consent of the Legislative Yuan or the Supervisory Yuan, then the President's power is too great, so it is necessary to retain the "consent power."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Supervisory Yuan held its 102nd meeting at 2:00 PM on the 19th. More than 30 members including Liu Chengyu, Yan Zhuang, and Wang Dong attended. The Minister of the Audit Department Lin Yunhai, Deputy Ministers Liu Jiwen and Ji Pingfan, and Supervisors Gao Yihan, Liu Houwu, Miao Peicheng, Li Sicong, Guo Zhongkui, Tian Jiongjin, and Zhang Weihan also attended. President Yu Youren presided over the meeting and reported on important work. Next, the part of the Constitution draft related to the supervisory system was discussed, and the attendees expressed their opinions separately. The meeting ended around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Enquires About the Review Process</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Chairman Jiang hosted a banquet for Zhang Qun, Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Cheng, etc. on the evening of the 19th, and enquired about the progress of the Constitution draft review during the banquet.</p>
<h3>Close Negotiations are Underway Between the Government and the Democratic Socialist Party; Concrete Results Can be Obtained Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Close negotiations are currently underway between the government and the Democratic Socialist Party. Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, frequently visited Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian, and even talked until late at night on the 18th. On the afternoon of the 19th, Lei visited Jiang for an hour and then visited again around 5:00 PM, which lasted until 7:00 PM. It is reported that concrete results can be obtained in these negotiations within days, and an announcement will be made by both parties. When Jiang Yuntian met with reporters in the evening, he made the following remarks: "We are an ordinary political party, and we adopt gradual steps to strive for democratic politics. We can adopt any method that can promote democratic politics by one step. We are also willing to cooperate with any political party for the purpose of striving for democratic politics. If the goals are not the same, we cannot cooperate. Therefore, in order to strive for democracy, we are prepared to negotiate with the government at any time. If the negotiations are successful, we will also cooperate with the government at any time. At the same time, we will act in accordance with the free will of our party, and will never rely on any party, nor will we ask for instructions from any party." Jiang Yuntian further stated that the current negotiations have a high probability of success every day, because both parties can consider the interests of the people and the country. At the same time, the Democratic Socialist Party is acting in the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. All issues will be resolved without any doubt as long as the Kuomintang can abandon one-party dictatorship, truly return power to the people, and announce it to China and foreign countries. Furthermore, Zhang Dongsun may come to Nanjing within days. If he cannot spare time from the affairs of Yenching University, he will send Hu Haimen as a representative to Nanjing. Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi, who went to Beiping yesterday, may return to Nanjing on the 20th. In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party has sent Hong Shaozhi as a representative to Shanghai by night train on the 19th and then fly to Hong Kong to meet with members of the Democratic Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>Zhang Dongsun Says He Does Not Intend to Go South</h3>
<p>Sun Baogang and Others are Scheduled to Leave Beiping Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi, representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party headquarters who invited Zhang Dongsun to go south, are scheduled to take a flight back south from Beiping on the 20th. Zhang Dongsun has decided not to go south. Today, Hu Haimen, a Standing Committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party who stayed in Changping, flew to Shanghai to convey Zhang Dongsun's views on the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly. On the 20th, Wan Renqian and Hou Bairen, important officials of the Democratic Socialist Party in Ping, will also follow Mr. Sun south to discuss their views on the current situation with the Democratic Socialist Party headquarters. After talking with Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi on the afternoon of the 19th, Zhang Dongsun told reporters that he did not intend to go south to participate in the National Assembly. As early as the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing, Zhang was among the 120 National Assembly representatives designated by the China Democratic League. Zhang crossed out his name at that time and did not intend to participate. In his personal opinion, the Democratic Socialist Party should definitely establish a neutral position that does not offend either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party in order to maintain the qualifications of special negotiators and promote the realization of peace. He also said that the lineup of the third party needs to be reorganized urgently.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] Sun Baogang, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party who came to the north, told reporters from this newspaper on the 19th: (1) Whether the Democratic Socialist Party will participate in the National Assembly is still in the stage of exchanging opinions within the party, and no decision can be made yet. This time I came to the north under orders to inquire about the opinions of our party members in the north. This issue is extremely complicated, and I hope that fellow party members can go to Nanjing and Shanghai to observe more, so as to pay attention to the development of the current situation at any time; (2) At this moment, the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party in the National Assembly should not be taken too seriously. If the Democratic Socialist Party participates and the National Assembly cannot pass the democratic Constitution draft revised by the Political Consultative Conference, then the Democratic Socialist Party will still oppose the National Assembly. If the Democratic Socialist Party does not participate, and the National Assembly passes the Constitution draft of the Political Consultative Conference, then the Democratic Socialist Party will still support this Constitution; (3) There is a certain distance between the Democratic Socialist Party and the government. If the government gradually becomes democratic, this distance will gradually decrease. If the government is farther away from democracy, the distance between the Democratic Socialist Party and the government will also be farther. Whether the Democratic Socialist Party participates in the National Assembly also depends on the democratic nature of the government; (4) At present, the Democratic Socialist Party has not participated in the China Democratic League as a party, but some party members participate in the China Democratic League as individuals. Therefore, the actions of the Democratic Socialist Party are theoretically not bound by the China Democratic League.</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the China Democratic League Will Not Change</h3>
<p>Zhang Shenfu Discusses the National Assembly Issue</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The China Democratic League had no activity all day. When reporters asked Zhang Shenfu in the evening if the China Democratic League could consider participating if the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the National Assembly, Zhang replied that the determined attitude was not to participate. Also, the Communist Party delegation's residence was deserted in the evening.</p>
<h3>Liang Shuming Will Fly to Chongqing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] Liang Shuming is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 21st to preside over the Mianren Academy and continue writing "The Essentials of Chinese Culture." This book was started in Yulin during the war and is three-fifths completed. It is also rumored that Liang will persuade Zhang Lan to enter Beijing to strengthen the China Democratic League.</p>
<h3>Women's Movement Association Hosts Female Representatives to the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Central Women's Movement Committee hosted a luncheon for all female representatives to the National Assembly and leaders of the women's movement in Nanjing at the Lizhi Society at noon on the 19th. A total of more than 80 people attended, and it was a grand occasion with beautiful women in splendid attire.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The National Government issued an order on the 19th: National Assembly representatives directly selected by the National Government, He Yingqin, Cheng Tianfang, and Feng Wangxiang, have gone abroad on official business and have not had time to return to the country to report. They will be replaced by alternate representatives Yu Xuezhong, Chen Fang, and Gao Zongwu respectively to attend.</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Presidium Election Method Was Revised and Passed by the Preparatory Meeting; Candidates Will be Nominated by Each Unit Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The National Assembly Preparatory Meeting held its second meeting at 9:15 AM on the 19th, still chaired by Sun Ke.

Separate elections by profession and region. The first speaker did not advocate separation. After a vote, it was passed by a majority vote that there would be no separate elections; 3. Deletion of the last sentence of Article 1. The voting machine button immediately lit up, and it was passed by a majority vote.

The number of candidates for the presidium elected by the representatives directly selected by the National Government shall be generated in proportion to the number of representatives produced by each unit. If it is less than the proportional number, it shall be calculated separately; 4. This method shall be implemented after being approved by the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly. (The number of candidates for each unit has been seen in yesterday's newspaper of this newspaper)</p>

It is also reported that 5,000 more Communist troops have arrived at Zhangfang, a strategic pass northwest of Zhuozhou, with the potential to spy on the railway line.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 19th Dispatch] Fierce fighting broke out again on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway yesterday. Nearly 60,000 Communist troops from one division and seven brigades caused major disturbances in the area west of Laishui.

There have been repeated contacts so far, and many villages and towns have been occupied by the Communist troops.</p>
<h3>Changchun's Security is Not a Concern</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th Dispatch] There are no problems with the security of Changchun City. It was once in a state of tension, but after counterattacking the Communist troops who were harassing various places, the morale of the people and the offensive of the Communist troops have both calmed down. At present, there are no traces of Communist troops outside 20 miles along the Zhongchang Railway.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Preparatory Meeting Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Today, the second day of the preparatory meeting, the atmosphere at the meeting place was obviously more lively and dynamic, and it was also more democratic.</p>
<p>The most popular speaker today was Zhu Jingnong. His voice was clear, his speaking was organized and concise, and he won a lot of applause. Every time he spoke, he stood in front of the microphone and held the microphone pole, posing like an actor in a drama.</p>
<p>There were two who were the most annoying. One was a representative from the Shaanxi Federation of Trade Unions, and the other was a representative from the Farmers' Association. The former spoke ramblingly and unclearly. There was a constant hissing sound from the audience, but he still continued to speak calmly until he was almost driven off the stage. When he came down, the meeting place roared. The latter used the posture of mobilizing the masses in the countryside and yelled with a hoarse throat, and was also dissatisfied by the representatives and hissed off the stage. As soon as this gentleman stepped down, the Shaanxi labor representative stood in his position and defended him, playing a tune of sympathy, believing that their right to speak had been deprived.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang arrived at the meeting place at 9:25 AM. The madam did not come with him. Secretary-General Hong was reporting when the chairman entered the venue, but he stopped immediately, which attracted the attention of the entire venue.</p>
<p>Bao Deming was the only female among the seventy-odd speakers in the two days. Her seat was upstairs, and a soprano voice was broadcast from the microphone, as if it had fallen from the sky. She was talking about the issue of women nominating candidates, but she did not get to the point and was deprived of her right to speak.</p>
<p>During the voting, the first time was still by raising hands. Many people were dissatisfied and raised questions. This was close to a child's curiosity, but then someone made an excessive reaction, saying: "There are too many empty seats. What if someone presses the button in the empty seat? So we should pay attention." Naturally, that is also a way to win by surprise, but Zhang Daofan stood up and said: "This kind of excessive concern is unnecessary. You can ask the people around you to monitor."</p>
<p>Not long after the meeting started, many people became impatient and felt that the chairman's voice was too small. So No. 1343 stood up and said something that the chairman could not hear on the stage: "The chairman's words cannot be heard at all in the back. If you can't hear it, you naturally can't express your opinion. Please pay attention!" But this sentence was like a breeze blowing across the water surface. There was no response on the stage, but it caused a commotion below.</p>
<p>The first vote was on the issue of whether to amend the draft or not. When the chairman put it to a vote, he said: "Those who agree to amend the original proposal, please raise your hands!" Conversely, it means that you do not agree with the original proposal. That is to say, those who raised their hands did not agree with the original proposal, but some people only knew how to raise their hands and naturally agreed. They did not know that what they agreed to was not the original proposal. After explaining it again, it was put to a vote again.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic, and it naturally became restless. In particular, the speakers were eager to speak and were extremely enthusiastic. The content of the speeches varied. Some were magnificent, some quoted scriptures, and some were long and boring. There were often people waiting for opportunities in front of the microphone. Several people almost looked like they were waiting for a bus.</p>
<p>When a representative was pulling out all the old cliches and giving a long speech from the manuscript, the chairman discovered that he was "off topic" and asked him to stop speaking, but the speaker could not hear him. So the chairman's bell did not work, and many methods could not stop this amazing speech.</p>
<p>In the chaotic situation of speeches, a representative gave the following wonderful theory: "If it is to be chaotic, it will be chaotic (referring to the atmosphere of the meeting). If it is not to be chaotic, it will not be chaotic. If it is already chaotic, then everyone will be chaotic. Why not correct it when it is just chaotic?" It sounds like it makes sense, and this passage is indeed chaotic enough.</p>
<p>The chairman left during the break.</p>
<p>The mercury lamp was never turned on once, and the photographers waited in vain for a long time.</p>
<p>Many people at the meeting hoped to hear Zuo Shunsheng's speech, but he said, "I am not prepared to speak today." The implication is that we will talk about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just as it was about to be put to a vote, Wu Tiecheng announced a note and sent it to the chairman's desk. After a while, Secretary-General Hong stood up and said: "Please note, news reporters should not sit in the representative seats!"</p>
<p>The break time was announced as five minutes, but it actually lasted from 10:20 AM to 10:40 AM, four times longer than announced.</p>

<h3>First Trial of "Murderous Devil":丁逆默邨 Deceitful Defense Unsuccessful; Attempt to Evade Responsibility Scorned by Judge</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] 丁逆默邨, former Director of the No. 76 Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, was tried all day on the 19th at the Capital High Court. Over a thousand people attended, those with certificates were allowed into the courtroom, while those without stood on the steps. The order was well-maintained, but it was not as lively as when 周逆佛海 was tried. Around 8 o'clock, 丁逆 was escorted to the High Court, wearing a dark blue wrinkled face camel hair robe, covered with a blue cloth long gown, gray trousers, and black leather shoes. His dry hair was tangled, his face haggard, and he wore rimless glasses. In the waiting room, after eating a bowl of noodles, he reviewed his confession statement one by one. At 9:45, Judge 金世鼎, along with judges 申屠宸 and 葛召棠, and Prosecutor 陈祖开 formed a collegiate panel in the Dacheng Hall. Lawyers 王龙 and 薛斋, and court-appointed defense attorney 章神吾 also appeared in court. Soon after, 丁逆 was brought in, and the interrogation began. From beginning to end, 丁逆 was sneaky and evasive, sometimes saying "I can't remember," sometimes saying "more or less," trying to get away with it. However, the judges were experienced and sharp, pressing him tightly with harsh words, and 丁逆's tricks ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Why the Fuss About "Explanation"? Attempt to Shift the Focus Ultimately Fails</p>
<p>At the beginning of the trial, his age, place of origin, occupation, and address were inquired about. 丁逆 vaguely stated: He was from Hunan, 44 years old, lived on Yuyuan Road in Shanghai, used to work in politics, and had never committed a crime. Then, Prosecutor 陈 thoroughly described the key points of the indictment, and the presiding judge further questioned his background and experience, and strictly questioned his motives for going to Hong Kong. 丁逆 claimed: In the 13th year, he did political work in the army in Guangdong, serving as a captain. When the headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army was established, he first worked as a secretary and then as a counselor. When the headquarters was abolished and the Military Affairs Commission was established, he served as a major general counselor. In the spring of the 22nd year, he also served as the director of the Third Division of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau. In the 27th year, it was renamed the General Affairs Office. After reorganization, he was dismissed from his post and went to Hong Kong for medical treatment due to illness. He suffered losses in business in Hong Kong and had a difficult life, so he returned to Shanghai, intending to practice Chinese medicine and engage in stock exchange business again. Unexpectedly, he was discovered by the Japanese within a few days. At this point, 丁逆 hesitated and prevaricated, finding it difficult to justify himself in the face of the court's multiple interrogations. He then requested to "explain" a few points: (1) He admitted his guilt, but later performed meritorious service to atone for his crimes, contacted the Central Government, and would never deny his criminal behavior. (2) After the victory and the completion of the takeover, he telegraphed Director Ying贺国光 of the Military Affairs Commission Office to forward it to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, asking for legal action and having no intention of escaping the law. (3) If the crimes were committed by the defendant, he should be punished, but those that were not should not be admitted, and he would not argue forcefully. (4) The favorable evidence was intended to show his sincerity and make the society understand that the defendant still had some contributions. Even if he was sentenced to death, he could comfort himself. In conclusion, although the defendant made a defense, he did not falsely claim innocence, and his repentance and surrender were not to seek exemption from punishment. He asked the court to understand thoroughly and would accept any punishment willingly; however, he could not be convicted based on hearsay. 丁逆's "generous" statement was interrupted by the judge, who sternly told him: "丁默邨! Favorable evidence for you will be thoroughly investigated. Saying you are guilty does not necessarily mean you are truly guilty, and saying you are innocent does not mean you will be let go. Everything will be based on facts and the law. Today is an investigation, guilt or innocence is yet to be determined. We are asking you why you went to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. We are carefully studying your motives. We only seek to understand the truth. You will have ample opportunity to defend and explain everything. There is no need to say more today." 丁逆 responded with a series of "yes," and his attempt to shift the focus failed. The court then asked: "You held an important position in the Central Government. Even after leaving the position of director, you still remained a counselor. The Central Government treated you well. Why did you leave without resigning or asking for leave, angrily leaving, and living in difficult circumstances in Hong Kong, not returning to Hankou, but instead going to Shanghai? Who asked you to go?" 丁逆 still claimed that the counselor position was concurrent, he had never received a salary, and he did not know whether it was retained or not. He was not used to living in Hong Kong, and Shanghai had good Chinese and Western medicine. He was tired of political life. 丁逆 firmly denied that he was invited to leave.</p>
<p>The Process of Joining "He Yun": He Claimed to Have Forgotten the Name of the Introducer</p>
<p>丁逆供 stated in great detail the process of participating in "He Yun," saying that he was coerced by the Japanese and Li Shiqun. He also claimed: He had always opposed Wang Ni, and his relationship with Wang was extremely bad, but because he had no way to escape, he was first placed under house arrest by Li Ni at No. 76, and then introduced by a certain Japanese from the "Mei Kikan," the Japanese strategy organization for China headed by Kageyama, to participate. He insisted that he had forgotten the name of the Japanese, and the "Qingqi" he provided in the prosecutor's investigation court was a memory error. He also claimed that his relationship with the Japanese at that time had to go through Li Shiqun, and he rarely participated in the planning of "He Yun." When talking to the Japanese, he never offered any advice, "because for major events they would look for Wang, and if they couldn't find the defendant, for minor events they would look for Li Shiqun, and they also couldn't find the defendant." According to 丁逆, his participation in "He Yun" was at the very beginning of the Pseudo-Sixth National Congress. He did not participate in any matters prior to the Qingdao talks, and he opposed the organization of the puppet government and expressed dissatisfaction with the "Basic Treaty," which were all resented by Wang Ni. "Everything in the puppet regime was based on Wang as the main body. The restoration of the 'Kuomintang' was just to deal with the rear and deceive people. The resolutions of the 'Central Executive Committee' and the 'Central Political Committee' were just read out by Wang, and there was no so-called approval. Even more ridiculous was that Wang often issued emergency orders first and then had the 'Central Political Committee' retroactively approve them. The defendant had no interest in this and did not often attend meetings, so he couldn't remember the details clearly." Here, 丁逆 wanted to gloss over the "Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Alliance Treaty" and our 重庆 Central Government's decree. After being pressed by the court, he had to admit: "It was passed by the 'Central Political Committee,' but in fact, I was just listening to the report. If I should be held responsible according to law, I absolutely admit it." The court then argued: "Don't try to delay or shift responsibility again. We want you to tell the truth. You must know that your attitude after repenting is related to your sentencing!" 丁逆 responded with a series of "yes," but still readily admitted responsibility from the side after his deceitful defense failed. Regarding the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, 丁逆 claimed that he had firmly opposed it. After the establishment of the puppet National Defense Conference, he did not serve as a member, but only listened to "reports" in the still abnormally existing "Central Political Committee." 丁逆 claimed: "Since January of the 34th year, because Chen Gongbo, the acting chairman, was more lenient than Wang, in order to obtain the most confidential intelligence to provide to the Central Government, I took office as the secretary general of the puppet National Defense Conference."</p>
<p>Shamelessly Calling "Injustice": Shifting Everything to Li Ni Shiqun</p>
<p>Then, 丁逆 explained in detail the process of holding various puppet positions, falsely claiming that there was nothing to do and that he had used every possible opportunity to do his best to benefit the people and resist Japan. He then held a defense statement, detailing the process of the No. 76 Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, falsely claiming: "Initially, Li Shiqun worked for the Japanese. After the agencies were established sporadically, they moved to No. 76 and expanded. After the Pseudo-Sixth National Congress, the headquarters organization was established. For the sake of appealing, Li Shiqun appointed himself as the deputy director and added the name of the director to the defendant, making it impossible to clear his name and being placed under house arrest. The defendant could not escape and did not want to commit suicide, so he could not refuse. It was an empty director position with no letter of appointment, and he could not take office and it was even more difficult to intervene in the work. Such circumstances were not easy for all parties to understand, but the fact that only power can control and oppress is a simple fact. Please investigate whether the defendant had the power. The guns and force of No. 76 were controlled by the defendant or by Li Shiqun. Later, the Secret Service Headquarters was renamed the 'Investigation and Statistics Department,' then renamed the 'Political Department,' and finally renamed the 'Political Security Department,' with Chen Gongbo concurrently serving as the director general and the defendant concurrently serving as the deputy director until he left Zhejiang in May of the 34th year." All the points he provided were nothing more than shifting all the crimes to Li Ni.</p>
<p>The court then read a letter to the editor column from a certain newspaper in Shanghai on the 11th of this month, an article titled "Ding Mochun, Whom I Have Experienced" by Zhang Yishu, the former Chinese director of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, investigating the crimes of persecuting patriotic individuals. 丁逆 defended, saying: "The person mentioned in the article, Geng Ji, was Li Shiqun's man, and he had met the defendant, but there was no relationship. He doesn't know who Zhang is, and there is no such thing." He denied it completely. The court then inquired about the case of Miss Zheng Pingru, an underground worker of the Military Statistics Bureau, and her comrades being arrested and killed after their failed assassination attempt against 丁逆, and the case of the murder of judges Qian and Yue. 丁逆 either lied and blamed Li Ni Shiqun and the Japanese, or claimed that the incident occurred outside of his term, trying to shirk responsibility, and shamelessly called injustice, saying: "If you say the defendant is a 'murderous devil,' you can execute him immediately, but it is really unfair to drag all the murder cases to the defendant. People who like to kill have different nerve movements from others. Please see how the defendant is." 丁逆 also claimed: Going to Zhejiang was on orders from the Central Government to serve as an internal response for the Allied forces, "turning against," "preventing communism." He vehemently denied all the evil deeds of collecting rice, conscripting labor, donating copper, and donating iron, using force to oppress the people. He also did not admit that the fallacy in his "New Year's Speech in the 33rd Year" was his handwriting, and said that he did not know who wrote it. For all of this, the court ordered that strong evidence be presented before it could be believed.</p>
<p>Presented Favorable Evidence: Actually Expressed Painful Regret for Supporting the Puppet Regime</p>
<p>Regarding the assault team, 丁逆 stated: "It was planned to establish an 'Anti-Communist Center' under 'Political Security' with the consent of Chen Gongbo. After going to Zhejiang in May, I did not ask about it. Chen then ordered Wan Lilang to prepare for it. Wan was also working on turning against the enemy. However, this matter was not realized due to the lack of firearms and funds." He arrogantly declared: "The plan for the assault team was definitely not to fight guerrilla warfare for the Japanese. To be honest, the defendant could command 50,000 to 60,000 people in eastern Zhejiang. If I wanted to take action, I really didn't need to start from scratch." Finally, the court presented a telegram from the Military Statistics Bureau stating that from the spring of the 26th year to March of the 29th year, when 丁 served as the director of the Secret Service Headquarters, he had captured and killed more than twelve underground comrades. 丁逆 vehemently argued that he was at No. 76 in the winter of the 28th year for only three months, and he could not be responsible for matters outside of this period and outside of Shanghai. The court then ordered that strong evidence be presented. At 1:30 in the afternoon, the investigation of favorable evidence began. 丁逆 then became sorrowful again, expressing painful regret for supporting the puppet regime. Then, defense lawyer 薛斋 presented seven categories and nineteen pieces of favorable evidence to the court. After the judge questioned the first category: "Assisting the War of Resistance and Benefiting the People," one of which was "Preserving Postal Rights and Maintaining Remittances," he announced a recess. It was already 1:45 in the afternoon. The four-hour interrogation had already exhausted 丁 Xun, who was as pale as paper and leaning against the interrogation seat, gasping for breath. His condition was very miserable. After the judges, bailiffs, and 丁逆 and his lawyers had lunch, the court continued at 3:10 to question the favorable evidence. The first category, two, "Rectifying Local Politics"; the second category, "Ordered to Rescue Central Underground Workers" (1) Rescue Wu Kaixian, Ge Jianshi, Jiang Bocheng, Chen Baohua, etc.; (2) Eradicate Li Shiqun, destroy No. 76; (3) Suggest the puppet government grant amnesty. The third category: "Assisting the War of Resistance and Benefiting the Central Government," (1) Alienate Wang Ni and Li Ni Shiqun; (2) Set up a secret radio station to provide intelligence to the Central Government. The fourth category: "Refused to Take the Nominal Position at No. 76," the fifth category: "Did not Kill Xu Ke of the Military Statistics Bureau," the sixth category: "Obeyed Central Government Execution Missions" (1) Notify Okamura to send a representative to ask for surrender; (2) Assist in the takeover. The seventh category: "Surrendered to the Central Government and Submitted a Letter of Repentance," etc., either with confirmation from relevant parties or with forced interpretations. The court questioned each one strictly. The trial ended at 5:30. The court ordered a retrial on a scheduled date, and the defendant was returned to prison. This mysterious and insidious demon king was already exhausted, walking with difficulty, returning to his cell in the twilight.</p>

<h3>Snippets of the "Devil's" Initial Trial</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter in Nanjing, Pu Dejie</p>
<p>The court strictly questioned why he left Shanghai for Hong Kong in the 27th year. Ding Ni said: At that time, his lung disease was close to the third stage, and he also had stomach and heart problems, so he had to go to Hong Kong for medical treatment. He was further questioned why he went to Shanghai again. He said that he had lost money in business, was more familiar with Shanghai, and wanted to make a comeback; he also said that he was not used to living in Hong Kong and there was no Chinese medicine. Looking at Ding Ni in court now, his appearance is really like a third stage T, B, and the traitor business can be considered completely collapsed.</p>
<p>From the start of the trial at 9:45 to the recess at 1:45, the trial lasted for four hours. Ding Ni was interrogated until his face was pale, and he asked for tea twice, drinking it like an ox, and slumped weakly against the railing of the interrogation seat, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>The presiding judge, Judge Jin Shiding, is a French-educated judicial expert. He questioned each topic from various angles, thoroughly and strictly. Although Ding Ni had three rabbit burrows, he was exhausted from escaping, had no way to defend himself, and all the attendees admired Judge Jin's superb interrogation skills. When the court questioned the murder case of Military Statistics Bureau underground worker Miss Zheng Pingru, Ding Ni initially claimed that he did not know this person. The court said, "You can't hide it. Instead of me asking, why don't you talk about it first." Ding Ni then began to describe it, first slandering Miss Zheng's personal morals for a while, and also said, please don't write it out in the newspapers; later he wrote all the accounts in Li Shiqun's and the Japanese's books. The court couldn't help but laugh at his ability to be eloquent, charming, and self-deceiving. When the court asked about his education, Ding Ni hesitated, saying that he graduated from the Second Middle School in Hunan, and he attended many universities, but none of them graduated. He smiled as if he was embarrassed. The old light bulb of the Asian Society's photographer exploded again (the National Congress opening on the 15th was also this public performance), and Ding Shu was startled first, and then smiled like an egret. This long-time special agent leader showed that he was used to this kind of sound. Ding Ni often said when answering questions: "I am saying it very frankly..." "This cannot be shirked...". The court then said, "That's good, there is no way you can hide the facts."</p>
<p>Ding Ni is extremely cunning, and often dodges with "I don't remember clearly" about the time and facts. The court always pursued the matter until it was accurate and certain. Seeing that his trick failed, Ding Ni had to pretend to turn over his confession and then say it.</p>

<h3>Savage Talks About TVA Project: May Not Be Completed for Fifty Years, Design Work May Be Completed in Two Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After arriving in Beijing, Dr. Savage, the designer of the American "TVA," has been studying various materials related to China's water conservancy plan for several days. According to him in a exclusive interview with the Central News Agency reporter: "The design work of the TVA has been completed by 10%. Because the survey and measurement work has not yet been completed, the design work cannot be carried out at an ideal speed. Two years later, the design work may be completed. Once the work begins, based on the foundation of China's industrialization, it may take fifty years to complete. The power generation will reach 10,560,000 kilowatts, the irrigation of farmland will reach tens of millions of acres, and navigation will also have great convenience. At current prices, this project will cost US$950 million." Also, Mr. Sa will soon accompany Huang Yuxian, Director of the National Hydropower Engineering Bureau, and other American experts to Kaifeng, Xi'an, Lanzhou and other places to inspect the water conservancy work in the Yellow River basin. Mr. Sa is now 67 years old, and his energy is still very abundant. He has devoted himself to water conservancy engineering construction for 43 glorious years. In addition to the "TVA," his engineering projects are spread across India, Australia, Mexico and other countries.</p>
<h3>International Standards Association, Our Country Elected as Standing Committee Member</h3>

<h3>United China Relief Holds Banquet: Begins Fundraising for Relief: Zhang Pingqun Explains That We Are Moving Forward on the Path of Democracy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] United China Relief (formerly United China Relief), the United China Relief, today began a campaign throughout New York City to raise $1.25 million in relief funds. Tonight, the association held a banquet. Speakers at the meeting tonight included the chairman of the association, recently elected Morningsted Dingnius of Connecticut, the chairman of the association, McKnow, Zhang Pingqun, the Chinese Consul General in New York, and McMullen, the secretary of the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, who recently visited China and returned to the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul General in New York, assured 400 American friends at a banquet hosted by United China Relief tonight: "The goal of the Chinese government is to make China a unified, peaceful, and democratic country." China is now advancing on the path of democracy. At the opening of the United China Relief fundraising campaign, Mr. Zhang thanked the American supporters of the United China Relief for their unlimited help. Mr. Zhang said: If the Chinese people can have the opportunity to work in peace, they will be able to put the country on track and improve their living standards with diligence and perseverance, so as to contribute to world prosperity. When Mr. Zhang discussed the continuous criticism of the Chinese National Government and the Kuomintang by some people in the United States, he said: This kind of criticism is really unfair, because if there are any bad phenomena, they are formed over a long period of time and are not easy to eliminate in a short period of time. Mr. Zhang also urged the audience to pay attention: "Although China has encountered countless difficulties, it can actually achieve unity to some extent from the chaos, and achieve construction in uncertain situations." Regarding the internal disputes in China, Mr. Zhang said: "We firmly believe that unless China is internally unified, China's construction is really impossible. In other words, first unify and then start reform work." Mr. Zhang continued: The Chinese government cannot tolerate the Communist Party, destroying transportation? Abandoning political agreements, and military expansion to seize national power. But Mr. Zhang finally said: The government is now preparing to continue to use political means to solve the problem of the Chinese Communist Party in order to achieve unity.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The End of a Phase in Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representative, Zhou Enlai, took an American plane yesterday morning to return to Yan'an, bringing the more than ten-month-long, on-again, off-again negotiations between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP to an end. Recalling the "Double Tenth Agreement Minutes" jointly issued by the KMT and the CCP last year, didn't it clearly proclaim a common principle? It stipulated that both the KMT and the CCP would "cooperate in the long term under the leadership of Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek], resolutely avoid civil war, build an independent, free, prosperous, and strong New China, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People." The two parties also agreed that "political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equal and legal status for all parties advocated by Chairman Chiang are the ways to achieve peaceful nation-building and freedom." However, over the past ten months, not only has the foundation for these peace negotiations not been expanded, but even the name of the CCP's Political Consultative Conference delegation has disappeared. Tracing the on-again, off-again peace talks of the past ten months, I don't know how many twists and turns there have been. One moment, it seemed like a breakthrough, and the future looked optimistic; but the next moment, darkness descended from all sides, and everything seemed bleak, leaving us, the ordinary citizens watching from the sidelines, almost lost in a fog, completely baffled. Sometimes, it was even a mix of laughter and tears. Now, it's finally clear: the government, with a spirit of tolerance, has repeatedly yielded, issuing three cease-fire orders in succession, but still failed to achieve domestic peace. The government has also repeatedly postponed the convening of the National Assembly, hoping that the CCP would realize its errors; however, the CCP's attitude remained stubbornly unchanged. It not only refused to participate in the National Assembly but also tried every possible means to undermine it, causing the peace talks to break down. Therefore, the CCP should bear full responsibility for the current stalemate, and it cannot evade it. The CCP's stubbornness is tantamount to isolating itself from the people of the country. We really feel sorry for the CCP. Now that the peace talks have come to an end, the future political development will naturally depend on how the government gives full play to the spirit of "doing its best."</p>
<p>This National Assembly, regardless of whether the CCP participates or not, opened in Nanjing on the 15th of this month, which is enough to prove that the government is indeed determined to return power to the people. Therefore, the people of the whole country have expressed warm welcome and support for the opening of this National Assembly and have placed unlimited hopes on it, hoping that Chinese politics will embark on a new era of peaceful nation-building. However, the sacred task of this National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, and the implementation of the new constitution requires the government to hold general elections on schedule within six months after the closing of the National Assembly, in accordance with the provisions of the new constitution, to elect representatives to the National Assembly to carry out the task of implementing the constitution. Therefore, during the session of this National Assembly, in addition to paying close attention to the National Assembly's drafting of the constitution, we must also pay attention to the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan. Regarding the constitutional issue, this newspaper's editorial has already discussed it, and we still hope that this National Assembly can formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution to open up a good start for our country's politics to embark on the road of peace and democracy, so as to promote national prosperity and progress. This goes without saying.</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan, the Democratic Socialist Party also regards this as one of the conditions for its participation in the National Assembly. At the same time, according to informal representations from government representatives, "the reorganization of the government is under consideration, but it can only be discussed with the parties after the lists of all parties are submitted, so during the National Assembly session, the National Government Committee can be reorganized, and the quotas for the CCP and the Democratic League in the National Government Committee will still be reserved. As for the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, due to the time issue, it must be implemented after the opening of the National Assembly." We can also judge from common sense that issues such as the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan and how to expand the foundation of the Executive Yuan, since all parties have gathered in one place due to the convening of the National Assembly, will definitely be discussed at this time.</p>
<p>The accumulated malpractices of Chinese politics today are nothing more than two points: First, the widespread decline in administrative efficiency. Whether in central or local administrative organs, from the responsible officials to the clerks, there are very few capable and experienced talents, and there is simply no such thing as administrative efficiency. Second, the prevalence of corruption. Judging from the current situation in political circles, we are increasingly convinced that to reform politics, we must start with rectifying the political atmosphere. Recently, the calls for political reform have been loud, but what is the actual effect? It is difficult to say. The people's yearning for good governance is like looking to the clouds in a severe drought, and it is really too urgent. However, from the closing of this constitutional National Assembly to the opening of the next constitutional National Assembly, there is still six months, which is a transitional period for returning power to the people. The government should fully demonstrate the spirit of "doing its best" to jointly plan national affairs with all parties and factions, and must also voluntarily reorganize the government, recruit national talents and leaders from all parties and circles, form a government of national unity, not only strive for efficiency in its administration but also create an honest political atmosphere, so as to lay the foundation for a democratic rule of law.</p>
<p>There is another factor that cannot be ignored in China's political journey towards democracy, and that is progress. Democracy should not only pursue its name, nor can it be achieved overnight. To gradually democratize politics, progress must be sought in stability. However, our country is a country with many difficulties. After eight years of war, the wounds are deep and painful, and in addition, everything is backward. The foundation of the country has not yet been firmly established. Although it cannot be said that it is in a state of turmoil, it can at least be said that the foundation is not yet stable. In today's world of turbulent waves, how can we seek the independent survival of the country? And how can we stand shoulder to shoulder with the great powers? We must rush forward day and night and catch up. Therefore, we hope that the reorganized government can be full of vigorous and healthy vitality, create a practical and honest political atmosphere, and eliminate all the habits of bureaucratic politics. After observing the political trends of various countries in the post-war world, we are increasingly convinced that Chinese politics should also embark on this road of progress. Taking British politics as an example, after the war, a general election was held, and the Labour Party was able to overwhelm the Conservative Party and come to power. For more than a year, although the Labour Party has made few achievements in domestic and foreign affairs, the general public has not lost its trust in the Labour Party. In the partial reorganization of the British cabinet last month, several young and promising junior members were appointed to the cabinet, which injected a lot of new blood into British politics and made it more energetic. Secondly, taking the US election as an example, the greatest significance of the Republican Party's victory can be seen as an expression of the American people's desire for progress. Similarly, the result of the recent French general election, in which the Communist Party jumped to the first place in the new parliament, also lies in this. Therefore, the partial reorganization of the British cabinet last month can serve as a demonstration for the reorganization of our government.</p>
<p>In short, the constitution formulated by this National Assembly is indeed a major step in the start of our country's constitutional administration, but in the transitional period, how the government should prepare for the implementation of constitutional government, so as to open up a good start for our country's democratic politics, is really too closely and significantly related to the future political development. Therefore, we hope that all parties will consider the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan carefully and deliberate for a long time, so as to make the reorganized government look brand new, safely pass through this transitional period of returning power to the people, and enter a truly constitutional new era, laying a solid foundation for the long-term stability and security of the country.</p>

<h3>Hui Binshi Acquitted, Released; Control Yuan Sends Investigators</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 19th] In the case of Hui Binshi, the former police chief of the puppet Wuxian County, accused of being a traitor, the Jiangsu High Court previously acquitted and released him.

<h3>Three Notorious Robbers Executed in Yuyao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Yuyao News] The three notorious robbers, Li Yuanyi, Gao Yandi, and Lu Wensheng, were originally soldiers of "Yuyao Security." After the victory, the authorities did not hold their past against them and allowed them to serve in the county self-defense force. However, Li and others did not change their wild nature. During the winter defense period last year, they took advantage of patrolling to abscond with their weapons and commit robberies in Simen Town and Shangtang Township, among other places. They were later apprehended by the county government and sentenced to death with approval. They were executed by firing squad in the eastern suburbs on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Guangde Abandoned Coal Mine: Preparations Underway to Resume Mining</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxing News] Shen Youzhai, a local resident, purchased hundreds of acres of mountain land in Wangcun, Ningcun, and Dongquan three forts, in the northern countryside of Guangde County, and Xiaoniutou Mountain in the 30th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign. He hired German mining engineers to test for coal, and the results showed that the coal was of excellent quality. Shen Youzhai then solely funded the organization of the Tianyu Company and applied to the　Bureau of Mines for permission to mine. The produced bituminous and anthracite coal was transported to Shanghai for sale. However, due to inconvenient transportation and poor business, operations were suspended. In the 33rd year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign, the Guangyi Company was re-organized by Xiang Zan Cheng et al., raising 6 million yuan to continue operations, but it was eventually closed due to insufficient capital. After the victory, Shen Juxiang, the son of the original founder Shen Youzhai, plans to re-establish the above-mentioned coal mine, with a pre-determined capital of 200 million yuan. A preparatory office has been set up at No. 103 Aishan Street, Wuxing. In addition to raising shares, an application will be submitted to the relevant authorities for approval and a license. Resumption of operations will be scheduled after that.</p>

<h3>Continuous Storms in Henan Provincial Council: Resolution Passed to Remove Two Councilors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kaifeng News] After the uproar caused by the opening ceremony of the Henan Provincial Council, shocking events continued to occur. When the provincial budget for the 36th year was discussed on the 11th, councilors who sympathized with the government and councilors who defended the position of the council nearly engaged in a full-scale brawl over the issue of simplifying the organization. The next day, the Republic of China Daily published a full account of the situation in the style of an observer's record. On the 14th, some councilors proposed to warn the reporter. The group of reporters then raised a protest based on the publishing law, and the entire group withdrew from the session. In addition, after listening to the report of Deputy Commander Wen of the military management district on the 13th, Councilor Guo Haichang proposed to remove Councilors Liu Jingjian and Zhang Jinjian for selling Henan recruits. The resolution passed unanimously. Currently, people in Henan believe that this session of the Provincial Council has many special tricks.</p>

<h3>A Cry from Refugees from Funing</h3>
<p>I am from Funing, where I narrowly escaped death on October 19th. I only managed to escape to Shanghai alone on the 28th. I will now relate the actions of the Communist army in Funing to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>1. All children, both boys and girls, around the age of ten and women, as well as old men up to the age of sixty, are forcibly conscripted, ostensibly to attend meetings, but in reality, they are sent to the front lines to boost morale and serve as cannon fodder. Those who are unwilling to go are immediately shot. The cries are earth-shattering and heart-wrenching.</p>
<p>2. Recently, in villages and towns, apart from one or two hundred elderly, weak, and disabled people huddled at their doorsteps, most of the young men and women who could not escape have secretly fled to desolate beaches, gathering as many as sixty or seventy thousand people. However, because food has been blockaded by the Communist army and there is no neighboring National Revolutionary Army to rescue them, they have no clothes or food, and they live in the open air, counting the days and looking forward to the National Revolutionary Army.</p>
<p>3. All one or two fair-minded intellectuals in the Communist area who are unwilling to join the Communist Party have been completely slaughtered.</p>
<p>4. Every village must hand over forty cowhides within a limited time, otherwise, they will be charged with being anti-democratic.</p>
<p>The above facts are all heard and witnessed by the author and are in no way fabricated. Therefore, most of the refugees fleeing on the Beijing-Shanghai line cry out in unison when they hear this, regretting their helplessness. They can only make a final appeal to our military and political authorities and to all the fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters in the country, pleading for our benevolent army to rescue them as soon as possible. We also ask the Communist side to have compassion and refrain from killing the innocent and forcibly conscripting women and children. We are anxiously awaiting orders - (Shi Ying, a newly arrived refugee from Northern Jiangsu)</p>
<h3>Rabid Dogs That Injure People Must Be Put Down Early</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a rabid dog in the area between Yangjiadu and Dongchang Road in Pudong, along Xinmalu, which often bites people, causing unexpected accidents to pedestrians. A few days ago, two children were bitten to death, and yesterday, a soldier from the 438th Regiment became insane after being bitten by a rabid dog. As a result, people are panicked and warn their children to avoid the area. However, rabies is highly contagious, and if it is not put down soon, it will inevitably spread everywhere as dogs bite each other. This matter concerns the safety of the lives of Pudong residents. We hope that the military and police authorities will capture and kill it as soon as possible. The citizens will be very grateful! (Zhang Tianyou)</p>

<h3>"Traitor Party" Amendment Rejected: British House of Commons Trusts Government</h3>
<p>Supporting UN Institutions as the Foundation of Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper London Special Correspondent, 19th] The House of Commons rejected yesterday, by a vote of 353, an amendment on British foreign policy. A majority of Labour MPs abstained from voting. Prime Minister Attlee and the Cabinet are extremely concerned about this, because although the House unanimously rejected the amendment to British foreign policy, the fact is that between sixty and one hundred Labour MPs abstained from voting. Diplomatic sources predict that Foreign Secretary Bevin will pre-empt in the United Nations meeting in New York on the Spanish issue, in order to resist stronger demands from the Soviet Union. Bevin may suggest that the UN General Assembly provide economic assistance to Spain after the Franco regime is overthrown.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 19th] The House of Commons yesterday unanimously expressed confidence in the foreign policy pursued by Foreign Secretary Bevin. Fifty-eight Labour MPs had proposed that the Labour government's foreign policy should follow a "middle path between the Soviet Union and the United States." The result of the vote was 353 votes to zero against.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 18th] The British House of Commons met today to continue debating the　book published by the King. During the session, Labour MP Crossman, speaking as a spokesman for the "Traitor Party" MPs, delivered a speech criticizing the Sino-American Commercial Treaty and supporting amendments to Britain's current foreign policy, expressing dissatisfaction with both Communism and anti-Communism. He said that the Soviet Union was attempting to incorporate Eastern European countries into its economic system, and that our government had repeatedly lodged protests against this, which he considered extremely appropriate. However, in the commercial treaty signed by China and the United States a few days ago, the United States forcibly stipulated the right of economic intervention in China. Why did the British government not say a word? Furthermore, the United States has stated that it will retain the bases it obtained from Japan. What will the result be if it does so? I would like to raise three questions for the government to answer: (1) Did the government deny the policy revealed by former Prime Minister Churchill in his speech in Fulton, USA? (2) Has the government signed an agreement with the US government to standardize military equipment between the two countries? (3) Have senior staff officers of the British and American militaries held talks? I know for sure that the British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff still exist, and I have also learned from responsible sources that Britain and the United States are still exchanging secret intelligence. Given the current international situation, Germany, Japan, and Italy have all surrendered. Who is the target of their intelligence gathering? If so, is it not in fact an alliance? This is enough to prove that the government has disregarded the promises it made and is acting in accordance with Churchill's speech in the United States. Britain must implement an independent foreign policy, opposing any international bloc, that is almost certain.</p>
<p>Conservative Party's Statement</p>
<p>Conservative MP Crookshank spoke after Labour MP Crossman, saying that the Conservative Party would continue to support the government's foreign policy, but that the government's policy in Germany was unsatisfactory. The results of the treaty negotiations that Stangate conducted with Egypt on behalf of the government were also unsatisfactory. In addition, the unstable situation in Palestine was also cause for concern. However, if the government were to split, the Conservative Party would still vote in favor of the government, he said.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Attlee's Defense: Denies Forming a Bloc Against the Soviet Union; Claims No Separate Alliance with the United States; Sino-US Commercial Treaty is Largely the Same as Those Signed with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 18th] British Prime Minister Attlee recently declared in the House of Commons: Before reading the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, I asked someone to get me a copy. After reading it once, I found that it was only an ordinary commercial treaty. It is no different from the commercial treaties that our country has signed with other countries, as well as the commercial treaties that the United States and the Soviet Union have signed with other countries. Why is this treaty considered an example of American imperialism? It is difficult to understand. The signing of a commercial treaty between China and the United States is not an example of one country invading another. Regarding the issue of British defense, it is foolish to think that Britain can compete with the United States or the Soviet Union in terms of military equipment. We only want to ensure our own national defense. We plan to contribute to the United Nations. Although several international　meetings and economic institutions have sincerely invited the Soviet Union to participate, the Soviet Union has consistently considered them inappropriate and has not sent representatives to participate. Can we not therefore establish these institutions with other countries? If a powerful country is allowed to choose certain political parties in its occupied territories as its "protectors," it will have unfortunate consequences for international cooperation. Nothing could be worse than this. If we can view Germany as a complete economic unit, the situation may be better than it is now. Labour MP Crossman said that the government is only flattering the United States and is unwilling to cooperate with the Soviet Union. This argument is due to MP Crossman's misunderstanding of the facts. All of MP Crossman's claims are not factual. The government does not believe that Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Central Europe should form blocs or form hostile blocs. We will support the United Nations. There are many serious issues for which the opinions of the United States, the Soviet Union, and our country are not consistent. But if MPs think that countries around the world are organizing blocs, this view is a fallacy. We may be more willing to compromise than some other countries, but compromise should be the basis of peaceful civilization, so we do not want to form an alliance with the United States. Regarding the speech that former Prime Minister Churchill delivered in Fulton, USA, the government did not reply, because the government is not responsible for replying to opinions expressed by people in their private capacity. In addition, because British troops are still jointly occupying some areas of Europe with American troops, Britain should continue to cooperate with the American staff. In short, the government and the majority of people in the United Nations still fully trust Foreign Secretary Bevin and hope that the House will also clearly express its support for Foreign Secretary Bevin.</p>
<h3>French Communist Party Leader Talks About Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Agreements Must Be Formed With Britain and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 18th] French Communist Party leader Thorez spoke to a London Times correspondent in Paris today, calling for the Allied countries to unite and form a common front to prevent Germany from attempting to rearm itself or economically control the European continent. He said: Regarding the Communist Party's foreign policy, it took a unique stance before the war, opposing the so-called non-interference policy and the Munich appeasement of Germany. Our position on foreign policy, especially on the issues of security and compensation, has been approved by the French public opinion circles. We hope to eliminate Fascism and effectively disarm Germany. We believe that it is not only necessary, but also indispensable for France to form an agreement with the three Allied countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. We oppose any policy that promotes the formation of blocs.</p>
<h3>Intense Debate in the Trusteeship Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters New York, 18th] During a debate in a subcommittee of the UN Trusteeship Committee today, the Indian representative suggested that all trustee territories should be governed by the UN agency itself. Soviet representative Novikov Tian advocated for the full discussion of the Indian proposal, and Iraq also seconded the Indian proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 18th] US representative Dulles declared in the Trusteeship Committee today that the Committee's discussion "proves that we are unable to handle any events." Representatives from other countries mostly said that India's proposal was only a formality. According to the UN Charter, if a trusteeship is to be transferred, the consent of the trustee country must first be obtained, but the Soviet Union still insisted on discussing it. The Soviet Union also criticized South Africa's request to merge Southwest Africa and Britain's refusal to submit a draft trusteeship of Palestine.</p>
<h3>The Romanian General Election Amidst Assassinations in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th (Radio): Eight million Romanians today held their first general election in nine years. Assassinations occurred in various places, and all parties attacked each other. According to the National Peasant Party, the government implemented terror, and seven leaders of the party were assassinated this morning.</p>
<p>[United Press, Romanian Capital, 19th] Sources today claimed that whether the Communist-controlled government of Romanian Prime Minister Groza is supported by the people will be tested in Tuesday's parliamentary elections. Both Britain and the United States have protested Romania's election, believing it has failed to fully guarantee the opposition's right to hold free and democratic votes. Romanian military police are prepared to suppress any violence that may arise if public sentiment is agitated before the election. Riots occurred in the Romanian capital on Sunday. King Michael of Romania enjoys strong popular support, which is not an issue in this election.</p>
<h3>The Five Powers Discuss the Veto Power; China Proposes Principles for Simplifying Voting Procedures; The Soviet Union Declares Its Right to Reserve "Rejection of All Suggestions"</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, proposed principles for simplifying the Security Council's voting procedures during today's discussion of the veto power at the Five Power Conference in New York. Gu suggested adding a provision to the Security Council's procedural principles, stipulating that the inclusion or deletion of items on the agenda should be considered within the scope of voting procedures and not subject to the veto power. The suggestion also stipulated that whether an issue is a situation or a dispute should also be considered within the scope of procedure. The content of Gu's suggestion is as follows: (1) Before voting on an important issue, an opportunity for consultation should be provided to reach an agreement. (2) When a permanent member abstains from voting on an issue that is not within the scope of procedure, it should not be regarded as a veto. (3) The issue of including items on the agenda should be considered within the scope of procedure. (4) The issue of deleting items on the agenda should be considered within the scope of procedure. (5) The decision of whether an issue is a situation or a dispute should be considered within the scope of procedure.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in a dramatic gesture at the Five Great Powers Conference today, reiterated that the veto power within the Security Council as stipulated in the Charter shall not be modified or abolished. However, he agreed to consider the proposals of the United Kingdom, the United States, and China to automatically restrict the use of the veto power, while still reserving the right to oppose them in the future. Molotov also stated that he did not know what significance it would have to burden the Security Council with more red tape. It is evident that Molotov firmly opposed the adoption of the "Rules of Conduct" proposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin to restrict the use of the veto power. Molotov also opposed China's proposal to suspend the discussion of the veto power issue in the General Assembly's Political Committee for two or three days to allow the Five Great Powers Conference to discuss the matter at length. However, the Chinese proposal was eventually passed by the Political Committee with 38 votes to 6, with 5 abstentions.</p>
<h3>Chinese Delegate Urges Establishment of an International Food Agency</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 18th] At today's session of the UN Economic and Social Committee, delegates urged the organization of an international food and relief agency to replace the soon-to-be-closed UNRRA. The Chinese delegate resolutely proposed the establishment of a drafting committee to begin work immediately to resolve the food problem, as this issue is critical to the lives of millions and cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3>Nikerov Succeeds as Commander of the Soviet Army</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] General Konev has been appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army, succeeding Zhukov, the conqueror of Berlin. Konev was previously the commander of the Soviet front in Ukraine, and his troops are currently stationed in the southern Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.</p>
<h3>The Four Foreign Ministers Reach a Practical Agreement on the Trieste Issue; Belgium Plans to Request Boundary Revisions</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th] The four foreign ministers, in a spirit of mutual concession last night, reached a practical agreement on the issue of the powers of the future Governor of Trieste. The agreement is generally the same as the draft chapter proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, with only minor revisions. After the meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said to his colleagues with a smile: "Today I made considerable concessions; when we discuss the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Trieste, do not forget this point." The original text of the agreement has been handed over to the representatives of the foreign ministers for final revision.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 18th] It is reported that Belgium is about to request a revision of the Belgian-German border to make it a straight line, correcting the current deformed state. Today's editorial in the "Liberation Daily" calls for straightening the Belgian-German border so that the cities of Aachen and the Urfa Dam are included in Belgian territory. It is reported that in addition to territorial claims, Belgium will also demand huge reparations, which the foreign ministry is currently studying.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Northern Mountainous Areas of Greece; Government Reinforcements Suppress Guerillas; Southern National Army Moves Closer to the Greek Border</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, London, 19th] The sporadic clashes between Greece and Yugoslavia along the border have evolved into large-scale warfare. With the help of aircraft and artillery, the government forces have forced the guerrillas back to the southern border. The guerrillas' strong defense line in the Zhina Mountains has been broken by government forces, and government forces have now recovered the border positions. It is reported that the guerrillas once penetrated as far as six miles into Greek territory a few days ago. The Greek government has announced that this war is by no means a small-scale conflict and is in fact no different from a formal war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 18th] Military sources: Since Saturday, fierce fighting has broken out between the Greek government forces and mountain guerrillas in the Skra Mountain area. The guerrillas have used heavy weapons and machine guns.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 18th] Greek fighter jets and reinforcements were reportedly dispatched today to participate in the operation against the guerrillas. The guerrillas attacked the village of Grachinchiros, west of Skra village near the Yugoslav border, for the third time in five days. According to the Thessaloniki military newspaper, the attacking troops came from across the border, penetrating one and a quarter miles deep into the Greek defense line. Reinforcements rushed to the village, inflicting heavy casualties on the guerrillas, who retreated in panic, leaving corpses scattered on the battlefield. In addition, the Greek General Staff reported to Prime Minister Tsaldaris on all attacks near the border since October 1, so that it could be forwarded to the British and American ambassadors to Greece. The two ambassadors are scheduled to visit the Prime Minister today. Sources close to the foreign ministry said that the Yugoslav army has moved closer to the border, but the number of troops is unknown. More than fifty residents of Skra village have been killed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 18th] Greek Liberal Party leader Venizelos tonight asked the Tsaldaris cabinet to resign in the House of Representatives and form a national unity government.</p>

<h3>Factionalism; A Tempest in a Teapot; Could Lead to Large-Scale Conflict; Observations on the Streets of India</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] A cyclist colliding with a pedestrian would not be news anywhere in the world, but it might be in India today. One day, an elderly Muslim man was riding his bicycle down a street in New Delhi when he collided with a pedestrian, and an argument ensued. Two other Muslims intervened, accusing the pedestrian of trying to harm the cyclist. Bystanders gathered to watch, including this reporter. When the pedestrian said that he was also a Muslim, the two arbitrators changed their tone and rebuked the cyclist, saying, "You doddering old man, you haven't learned how to ride a bicycle properly and you're recklessly colliding with your fellow Muslims!" The commotion then subsided. If the pedestrian had been a Hindu, then this tempest in a teapot might have led to a large-scale religious conflict.</p>

<h3>China in the Minds of the British People</h3>
<p>— Sent by Our Newspaper's Resident Correspondent in the UK, Zhu Zunzhu</p>
<p>[London, Airmail on November 5] Recently, a British Member of Parliament raised two questions with me about China: (1) China is currently embroiled in war, the United States supports Chairman Chiang, and the Chinese Communists apparently have the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union. Will this situation, if it continues to develop, escalate into World War III? (2) The United States is currently monopolizing trade with China. In the future, will other countries, including Britain, be excluded from the Chinese market?</p>
<p>In the minds of the British people who generally care about China, these are two big question marks. First, they fear that the world will once again be plunged into war, and second, they fear losing the 450 million Chinese customers. During the past eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, because there was no trade to speak of between Britain and China, and the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East had not yet become clear, the attitude of the British people towards China was indifferent. Most people believed that the Chinese battlefield was not important. After the war ended, the British Empire, which relies on foreign trade for its livelihood, opened one eye and looked at the Far East, and the two terrifying questions above spontaneously arose. The world situation is already dark enough in both politics and economics, but in the Far East, the clouds seem to be even denser!</p>
<p>After the abolition of the unequal treaties, the concessions no longer exist, and China, which was regarded as a semi-colony, has changed its past practice of handling foreign affairs and flattering foreigners. Where did past British merchants know about Chinese law? Where were they willing to go to Chinese courts? In addition, with the current inflation, soaring prices, traffic congestion, and widespread suffering, the adventurous British merchants cannot help but sigh repeatedly, believing that the world has completely changed. The Chinese paradise has disappeared with the war, and everything in China has reached a hopeless state. The news they send back, as well as the reports of some British merchants who have returned to Britain, portray China as a pitch-black mass. A group of so-called "Old China Hands" are even gnashing their teeth, believing that the future is bleak. The China in their minds was nothing more than the concessions in Shanghai and other places, so the Shanghai municipality after the return of the concessions to China is the spearhead of their attacks. They believe that China is not worthy of ruling a modern city like Shanghai.</p>
<p>The China seen in British newspapers and magazines is precisely an example of these unfavorable comments about China. The news from China is either civil war or corruption; either inflation or famine and death. Most readers do not have ill feelings towards China, and their reaction is only sympathy. However, some British people who sympathize with the Chinese Communists take the opportunity to exaggerate and make a big fuss about it.</p>
<p>Although British merchants are drooling over the Chinese market, under the current circumstances, most of them are hesitant to move forward, and their attitude is to wait and see. Sir McGowan, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, said very frankly: A stable Chinese political situation is a prerequisite for British assistance in China's industrialization. Now that China is in the midst of civil war, the economy is shaky, and the government organization has not become sound, at least Imperial Chemical Industries does not intend to invest in China for the time being. McGowan then said in a self-consoling tone: In the foreseeable future, the British economic recovery work will require a large number of technical personnel, and there is no time to look abroad. Imperial Chemical Industries is the largest chemical company in Britain, and McGowan's attitude can represent the general view of large capitalists. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Import Permit System Implemented Yesterday; Goods Reported with Permits for Import; Registration of Importers Conducted Simultaneously; Bei Zuyi Calls on President Song to Report on Work Progress</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the management of import trade, the government has implemented revised interim regulations for import trade and established a provisional Import Management Committee implementing committee under the Supreme Economic Committee. The committee has been established in Shanghai, and the import permit system for imported goods was implemented yesterday. For goods ordered before November 17 (the date of the announcement) but not yet declared for import, it is also necessary to obtain a supplementary import permit for customs clearance and foreign exchange settlement. Import permit application forms can be obtained from designated foreign exchange banks. After filling them out according to the instructions, an import permit will be issued after review and approval, and the goods will be reported for import with the permit. The authorities' move is aimed at reducing the import of non-essential goods, so the authorities will do their utmost to prevent illegal smuggling of goods by unscrupulous merchants in the future. In addition to the Port Reorganization Committee's security and investigation team being responsible for strengthening the seizure of goods in Shanghai, measures will also be taken to strengthen the crackdown on rampant smuggling in southern China. President Bei of the Central Bank has specially dispatched the bank's Business Bureau Director Lin Fengbao to fly to Guangdong to inspect the situation and discuss methods to ban the import of smuggled goods with the local military and political authorities. Bei himself will also go to the area for inspection soon. However, China's coastline is very long, and it is extremely difficult to completely eliminate unscrupulous merchants' smuggling of goods. Therefore, the authorities urgently hope that businesses can cooperate with the government to eliminate the evil practice of smuggling. In addition, in order to strengthen the management of importers and exporters, the authorities began to register importers yesterday. Those who were already operating before December 8, 1941, or who have been operating since then and are recognized as agents of foreign manufacturers, or who can prove that they have the ability to engage in import trade, may apply for registration.</p>
<p>Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning at around 9:00, he went to the Central Bank Building to handle official business and met with Deputy Premier Weng Wenhao, Director General of Customs Li Du, Mayor Wu Guozhen, and others to discuss matters. He did not leave until 1:30 in the afternoon. At around 2:00, President Bei Zuyi of the Central Bank went to Song's private residence to meet with him and report on the progress and promotion of the work of the provisional Import Management Committee implementing committee recently established in Shanghai. After 4:00, Song returned to the Central Bank to work, and Weng visited again and had a long conversation.</p>
<h3>American Businessmen Discuss Feelings on the Implementation of Import Permits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Since the administrative authorities announced the implementation of the import permit system, most American businessmen in Shanghai are still studying the measures in detail. Merchants who do not engage in import and export business avoid mentioning their feelings about the new measures, but those whose main business is import and export sometimes frankly express their positions. Yesterday, this reporter met with an American manager of a large foreign firm. He said that the detailed measures are still under study, but he has three impressions of the Chinese government's actions: (1) The purpose of these measures is to improve China's economic situation, which is not objectionable in itself. However, based on his past experience in China, measures and implementation are two different things. We hope that the government can implement these measures in a completely fair and impartial manner. (2) The Chinese government has imported a large number of radio equipment in the past few months, regarding them as commodities needed by the people. However, in the new measures, they have been listed as goods subject to strict restrictions. His company is not mainly engaged in the import of radio equipment, so the impact on him is not significant. However, he does know that there are some small Chinese trading companies that make a living from this, and the new measures will put them out of business. It is clearly unfair to ban civilian imports of radio equipment simply because the government owns a large amount of radio equipment. (3) Unless the import quotas are clearly announced and information is exchanged frankly, this measure cannot be said to be in conflict with the spirit of the new Sino-US commercial treaty. The new measures will not reduce the total volume of trade in the short term, but in the long term, they will reduce the volume of international trade. He concluded by saying that his views can represent the common views of most American businessmen in China. They have been doing business in China for many years and have developed feelings for China. They all hope to stay for a long time, expand their own businesses, and also be willing to do their best to assist in China's construction work.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Train Post Office to Begin Operations Today</h3>
<p>Postal news: In order to accelerate postal transportation between Beijing and Shanghai, the Directorate General of Posts has ordered the Beijing and Shanghai Post Offices to dispatch personnel to the Beijing and Shanghai Railway Administrations, respectively, to pre-sort and dispatch Beijing-Shanghai mail so that it can be delivered upon arrival. In addition, a train post office will be established on the daily overnight express trains running between Beijing and Shanghai, and personnel from the Beijing and Shanghai Post Offices will be dispatched to sort the Beijing-Shanghai mail dispatched by the two offices and the mail from the bureaus along the way that is handed over to the train. The goal is to ensure that mail sent between Beijing and Shanghai is received no later than the day after tomorrow. The train post office will also sell stamps and accept ordinary, registered, and express mail. It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Administration has complied with the order and is scheduled to begin operations today.</p>
<h3>Vice Chairman of the British Chinese Chamber of Commerce Talks About High Domestic Prices; Remittances from Overseas Chinese Are Far Less Than Before; Hopes for Proper Measures for Repaying the Principal of National Salvation Bonds; Handicrafts Are Most Popular and Should Not Be Neglected</h3>
<p>According to Li Zigun, vice chairman of the British Chinese Chamber of Commerce, who recently returned from London to attend the Sichuan seat of the National Federation of Commerce Representatives: There are approximately over 10,000 overseas Chinese in Europe, of whom over 1,000 reside in Liverpool, England, over 600 in London, and the remainder of over 8,000 are scattered throughout the European continent, such as Germany and the Netherlands. The majority of them are employed as sailors, in restaurants, and in the laundry business. Their average weekly income is eight pounds, and their expenses are approximately two pounds per week. The remainder is mostly deposited in local postal savings bureaus. Overseas Chinese are concerned about the soaring domestic prices, which are nearly the same as the cost of war bonds purchased in England in 1931. The authorities should take proper measures regarding the exchange rate between legal tender and the pound at that time. The domestic political situation is of the utmost concern to the overseas Chinese. This time, the overseas Chinese are willing to return to China and assist in technical skills and capital. In the past, the Japanese deeply understood this mentality and often imitated them, labeling them with the words "Made in China" and mixing them into the European market to make huge profits. If China promotes export trade, these handicrafts should not be neglected. Moreover, the import tax rate there is approximately one-third of the value, which is far less than the 150% rate required for the import of raw silk. The reason for such restrictions on the import of raw silk is that the English artificial silk business is often related to government officials, so they allow it to develop as much as possible.</p>
<h3>American Medical Aid to China Association to Focus on Medical Education; Raising Funds in the United States to Help China Develop</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Mr. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Health Committee of the Executive Yuan, has recently also been appointed as the Health Director of the American Medical Aid to China Association. According to Mr. Liu, the American Medical Aid to China Association is currently raising funds in the United States. It is still difficult to say how much money can be raised, but the amount is likely to be small. Next year, the association will focus on developing medical education. There are currently more than 50 public and private medical schools in China. The association's new plan is to select and provide special assistance to five or six of these medical schools due to financial constraints. The assistance plan is divided into three aspects: (1) providing teaching equipment and medical supplies; (2) sending professors to the United States for further study; (3) hiring foreign professors to teach in China. The association will not provide assistance for school expenses or building construction.</p>

<h3>Land Registration Measures for French Nationals Formulated Based on the New Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The land registration measures for lands owned by French nationals in this city have been formulated by the Land Administration Bureau based on the new Sino-French treaty and the discussions held by Mayor Wu, Director Zhu, and the French Consul General. According to reporters, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  French nationals who own land in this city and hold deeds from the French Consulate, "Dao" deeds, or land ownership certificates, which are definitively owned by the French national, should immediately register with the Land Administration Bureau and exchange them for a land ownership certificate.</p>
<p>2.  French nationals who hold provisional receipts, field slips, or other temporary land certificates should also apply to the Land Administration Bureau for registration in their own name and be issued an ownership certificate.</p>
<p>3.  French nationals applying for land registration should first bring the relevant documents to the French Consulate to provide a statement confirming that the property rights belong to them. The French Consulate will review the deeds and issue a certificate.</p>
<p>4.  After completing the above procedures, the French national should submit the deeds verified by the French Consul, photographs, the certificate from the French Consulate, and the sales contract to the Land Administration Bureau for registration.</p>
<p>5.  When the Land Administration Bureau registers land owned by French nationals and issues new ownership certificates, fees will be waived in accordance with the new Sino-French treaty.</p>
<p>6.  In case of loss of property rights documents, a photograph of the deed, documents extracted from the French Consulate's register, a guarantee from the owners of the four adjacent properties, or a surety from a shop can be submitted.</p>
<p>7.  If the holder of a French "Dao" deed or a French Consulate deed is not a French national or a national of an allied country, but a national of another foreign country, they should apply to the consulate of their country and the Land Administration Bureau for verification.</p>
<p>8.  The Land Administration Bureau will promptly notify the French authorities of the name of the new owner and the registration number for registered French "Dao" deeds and French Consulate deeds.</p>
<h3>U.S. Consul Visits Director Zhu to Discuss Land Registration</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] U.S. Consul Braun visited Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, yesterday afternoon to exchange views on the registration of land owned by American nationals in this city and to inspect the bureau's registration office. The U.S. Consulate has already printed the forms for American nationals to use for land registration.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Since the opening of land value tax collection on the 16th of this month, payment has been enthusiastic in various districts, with the South Shanghai district being the most crowded.</p>
<h3>Closure of the National Assembly Reception Station in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Municipal Government previously established a reception station for National Assembly representatives at the Jinmen Hotel to assist with purchasing train tickets and arranging accommodation. As the number of representatives passing through Shanghai has decreased recently, the station was closed yesterday. Representatives needing the Municipal Government's assistance can contact the Protocol Section. Furthermore, Fang Xikong, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wu Shaoshu, Director of the Youth League, will host a banquet for National Assembly representatives from Xinjiang at the Friends of the Military Society at 7:00 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Extension of Company Registration by Two Months; Penalties for Non-Compliance; Businesses Must Not Call Themselves Companies Without Authorization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously received instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulating that any business using the name of a company should be investigated by the local authorities and ordered to cancel the company name in the newspaper. They should also be ordered to register as a commercial enterprise in accordance with the law. Companies that have not yet registered should be ordered to register within a specified period, and those who refuse to comply should be punished in accordance with the Company Law, and ordered to register within a specified period without delay. After receiving the order, the bureau published a notice banning ordinary businesses from calling themselves companies, and all companies that had not yet registered were required to complete registration before the end of October of this year. As the deadline has passed, and there are still many businesses that are not companies but use company names without removing the word "company," and companies that have not yet registered with the bureau, the bureau, out of consideration for the business community, and possibly due to a lack of clarity regarding the procedures for company registration under the Company Law, has extended the registration period by two months to the end of December of this year. Penalties will be imposed for non-compliance, and no further leniency will be granted. The bureau has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to urge all businesses to comply. It is hoped that businesses using company names without authorization will immediately cancel the company name and apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for commercial registration to avoid penalties. Companies that are actually companies but have delayed registration should pay attention to their own legal interests and quickly complete registration in accordance with the law, and not delay and make mistakes.</p>
<h3>The Mayor's Satire: A Dim Lamp in the Office</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] I remember not long ago, I went to the Municipal Government to interview Mayor Wu about a news item. The Mayor casually mentioned the issue of conserving electricity, but when he looked up, he saw six electric lights shining on the ceiling, plus a desk lamp, making a total of seven. The Mayor jokingly said to the reporter: "All I really need for my office work is the desk lamp, but the workers have turned on all the lights on the ceiling, which is a waste of electricity!" Yesterday, I went to the Municipal Government again to interview Mayor Wu about a news item. From outside the Municipal Government, looking at the Mayor's office, I saw only a dark space inside the window. I assumed the Mayor had finished his work and returned home. However, after submitting my name card, Mayor Wu immediately received me. Entering the office, I found Mayor Wu working on important matters at his desk under a dim lamp. The entire Mayor's office was immersed in that weak, dim light. This scene may not be very harmonious, but it serves as a powerful satire for those shops with their display windows full of fluorescent lights, or those mansions illuminated like daytime by electric lights!</p>
<h3>Air Raid Alert Tomorrow to Commemorate Air Defense Day; Rally at the Grand Theater; Display of Giant Bomb Model; Condolences to Families of Victims</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Air Defense Day Preparatory Committee broadcast on all radio stations at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, asking families of those who died in air raids in 1937 to quickly register at the district office in their area to obtain proof of identity so that they can participate in the Air Defense Day Commemoration Rally to be held at the Grand Theater at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow and receive condolences from the rally. In addition, the committee has also sent invitations to the families of comrades who died in the line of duty during air defense in Shanghai in 1937, and to the families of those who died in the line of duty during air defense in the rear, asking them to participate in the rally and will distribute gifts of appreciation. The Preparatory Committee also sent a letter to the Air Force Supply Command here yesterday, asking it to display trainer aircraft and flight equipment in Fuxing and Zhongshan Parks tomorrow. Large models of bombs will be displayed at the locations where enemy planes dropped bombs on the Bund and the Great World area on August 14, when our air force dispatched a large-scale battle against enemy aircraft, as well as at major intersections such as Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, to raise the awareness of air defense among the citizens of the city. The committee also held its second preparatory meeting at the Police Bureau Conference Hall at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 20 representatives from party, government, military, police, and group organizations attended and decided on the spot: (1) At 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, an air raid alert will be sounded, first an air raid alert, then an emergency alert, and finally an all-clear alert. The time between each alert will be two minutes. (2) The Presidium of the Air Defense Day Commemoration Rally will be composed of the Mayor, the Garrison Commander, the Speaker of the Municipal Council, the Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Commander of the Military Police Regiment, the Director of the Youth League, the Air Force Supply Commander, the Naval Base Commander, the President of the Local Association, the Directors of the Municipal Government Bureaus, and the Director of the Civil Affairs Office. (3) The Aviation Committee will be requested to send planes to distribute leaflets related to air defense propaganda on that day.</p>
<h3>Low Coal Reserves and Difficult Supply; Control Is Necessary</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] This reporter recently visited the fuel management authorities to inquire about the coal supply situation in this city and learned that the total supply of coal in this city this month is over 140,000 tons. Of this, public utilities account for 60,000 tons, railways account for 30,000 tons, shipping accounts for 30,000 tons, and the Coal Industry Association distributes 20,000 tons, mostly resold to small factories. In terms of price, public utilities related to the welfare of citizens are given special preferential treatment and are sold entirely at cost. This month, the price is only 90,000 yuan per ton. The city's inventory is only 70,000 to 80,000 tons in total, which is not enough to supply the entire city for one month if there is a problem with northern transportation. Therefore, applications for distribution must be very strict. As for the source of coal, the bulk comes from the Kailuan Coal Mine, and a small portion comes from Taiwan. Transportation is self-provided, with more than ten ships, each with a tonnage of over 5,000 tons. The supply of coal is subject to two restrictions: (1) The output of coal mines cannot be increased overnight. (3) The port and dock facilities at the production site have been used to the maximum extent. Many barges were damaged during the eight years of war and are difficult to replenish, which also reduces the efficiency of port loading and unloading and transportation. Maintaining the current supply is already the greatest effort. At present, the control of coal is necessary because the total supply is fixed. If merchants participate, they cannot increase the supply and only increase costs due to the inability to plan comprehensively, which increases the burden on citizens.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Promises to Send Ships to Help Transport Coal to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, in order to assist the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in transporting coal to supply ships and other coal users, yesterday Cheng Yuzhai, manager of the Zhongxing Shipping Company, and Li Zhiyi, manager of the Yixiang Shipping Company, and other representatives, discussed specific measures with Xu Letian, chairman of the association. After a long discussion, the shipping industry agreed to allocate one or several large ships to transport coal for the committee at a particularly low freight rate. Other ships will also assist with coal transportation as much as possible if they have spare tonnage. The Fuel Management Committee will also allocate sales fairly and fully to enable ships on all routes to operate regularly and maintain transportation. After the meeting, the person in charge of the association said that shipping is an urgent public utility, and its nature is the same as railways, electricity, and water. The Shipping Industry Association, in order to reduce the difficulties in supply for the Fuel Management Committee and enable various shipping companies to obtain the necessary coal, is preparing to send ships from the association to the production area to transport coal for reserve, and guarantees that it will never flow into the black market.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Orders Branches to Report Losses During the War; Strengthening Transportation and Reconstructing Wharves</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has prepared statistical tables to investigate wartime losses and submitted them to the government authorities in order to claim compensation from Japan. The survey and statistics work in this city has been completed. It is reported that it has now further transferred the losses suffered by the bureau at various ports in South and North China. In addition to ordering personnel at each branch or office to investigate and report to the head office locally, it will also send personnel to ports that have not yet restored their pre-war institutions to conduct on-site investigations in order to ensure that all statistics are accurate and facilitate the work of claiming compensation. In order to promote the development of its business, the bureau has recently rebuilt the original wooden wharves into fixed wharves of steel and concrete to facilitate the loading and unloading of cranes and various heavier vehicles, thereby strengthening the work of land and wharf transportation. At the same time, it has also strengthened the management of the coolie workers at the wharves in order to reduce theft and unexpected events. As for the construction of warehouses, it is also actively proceeding to ensure that the entrances and exits are wide and the air is unobstructed to facilitate the entry and exit of goods and reduce spoilage.</p>
<p>New Shanghai-Philippines Route to Be Added Next Month</p>
<p>The bureau also believes that there are many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and maritime transportation relies entirely on foreign shipping lines. In order to open up new international routes, it has recently added and repaired the Hai Xia passenger ship, which will be completed in two weeks. It has been decided that the Hai Xia will operate between Shanghai and the Philippines starting next month. The Hai Xia has a wide hull and can carry more than 600 passengers each time. The fare has not yet been determined. In the future, if new passenger ships can be purchased, the maritime transportation on the Shanghai-Philippines route will be further strengthened. However, passengers traveling to the Philippines must complete exit procedures, such as obtaining an exit passport, possessing various epidemic prevention certificates, and obtaining an entry permit from the consulate of the country in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wool Yarn Prices Fall Below Cost; New Prices Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>The Wool Yarn Evaluation Committee held its fourth evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau conference room yesterday to discuss the resolution of raw materials and other issues: (1) The prices of various grades of wool yarn have now fallen below cost, so new prices will be temporarily postponed, and the prices assessed by the third evaluation meeting will continue to be maintained. (2) In addition to the allocation of finished goods from various wool yarn factories being the main priority, members of the Wool Yarn Industry Association can handle matters directly with various manufacturers at their discretion. (3) The Wool Yarn Association proposed that if imported or exported wool yarn arrives, it should be distributed by members of the Wool Yarn Industry Association and not sold to people outside the industry in order to eliminate the black market. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that this principle is acceptable, but it needs to be investigated further before a decision can be made and will be discussed further at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Runway at Longhua Airport to Be Paved with Cement</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The runway at Longhua Airport in this city will be paved with cement. The Ministry of Transportation has established the Longhua Airport Construction Engineering Office and appointed Chen Zudong as director. Chen has already led engineering personnel to Shanghai to prepare and has ordered 300,000 bags of cement weighing ten kilograms each from the China Cement Company. The goods will be delivered successively in two weeks.</p>
<p>Cement runways are heavy-duty and durable and can be used for the landing of large aircraft. After completion, it will enhance air transportation significantly.</p>
<h3>Colbert Returns to the U.S. Yesterday</h3>
<p>Colbert, one of the hosts of the American China Policy Association, recently came to China from the U.S. on official business and returned to the U.S. by plane yesterday morning. During his stay in Shanghai, he visited Mayor Wu and also met with Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Shih in Nanjing. According to him, 75% of the people in the United States sympathize with the Chinese Nationalist Government.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Soldiers Reception Center Officially Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command, in view of the stray soldiers wandering the streets, has established the Shanghai Remnants of Soldiers Reception Center, which was officially established yesterday. The center is located at 462 Diswei Road, and Zhang Rongxian, the former battalion commander of the special service battalion of the command, has been appointed as the team leader. More than 20 remnants of officers and soldiers have now been received, and a large number will continue to be received in succession in the future. The 23rd Military Police Regiment will forcibly execute the order on the stray soldiers on the streets. The reception and training time is tentatively set at two months. After the training is completed, they will be replenished to various troops or assigned to work in various military supply factories.</p>
<h3>Continued News of the Large Fire in West Shanghai; Two Factories Suffer Losses of Over 900 Million</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Hua Feng Rubber Goods Manufacturing Factory at 54 Panjia Ku, Dunxin Road, West Shanghai, and the adjacent Wang Deji Waste Flower Factory at 55, caught fire at around 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. The fire spread fiercely and continued until yesterday morning.</p>
<p>All were extinguished, resulting in huge losses. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to the police investigation, although the fire was largely controlled by 8:30 p.m., the open-air storage of waste flowers at Wang Deji Waste Flower was piled up like a mountain, more than several feet high, making rescue difficult. Therefore, it took more than sixteen or seven hours to extinguish it completely. As a result, all four or five thousand bales of waste flowers were reduced to ashes. According to the person in charge of the factory, the insurance premium for waste flower storage is more expensive than other warehouses, so it was not insured. The fire insurance for the Hua Feng Rubber Factory is reportedly only 30 million yuan, insured by the Shanghai United Insurance Company for 20 million yuan and the Lihua Insurance Company for 10 million yuan. It is said that Hua Feng's losses are about 700 million yuan, and Wang Deji's are nearly 200 million yuan, totaling more than 900 million yuan, which is the largest disaster in recent years. The Changning Branch Bureau will submit the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for review.</p>
<p>[Another Report] After the first factory of Hua Feng Rubber Factory was hit by the fire, it is now known that the raw material and finished product warehouses are isolated from the factory and were fortunately kept safe. The company recently purchased a second factory on Jiangwan Road, which is much larger in scale and equipment than the first factory, so the output is not affected.</p>
<h3>Lengthening the North Station Platform; Construction to Begin Soon; Strengthening Police at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Transportation Department of the Railway Bureau believes that the North Station platform is too short, only more than 270 meters long, so that longer trains cannot stop completely when entering, which is prone to danger, and passengers are also inconvenient to get on and off. Therefore, it has been decided to extend it to more than 360 meters long, and construction will begin in the near future. It is expected to be completed in three months, and the canopy on the platform is also planned to be added. As for increasing the number of trains to reduce passenger congestion, it is feared that it cannot be realized in the short term due to the lack of carriages and other materials. Regarding the police department, it is reported that: In order to strengthen security, especially during the convening of the National Assembly, the department increased the number of armored vehicles and patrols one week before the convening of the National Assembly, patrolling between stations day and night. At the same time, armed railway police were also assigned to the special trains of the National Assembly representatives to protect them, so the escort situation was very thorough.</p>
<h3>Foolish Young Master Pretends to Commit Suicide; Passionate Girl Almost Dies for Love; Luo Shuzhi Charged with Two Crimes to Be Investigated According to Law</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Luo Shuzhi, a young man from Hunan, 25 years old, is the young master of a certain winery at 91 Anyuan Road. Yang Jingwen, a beautiful, 16-year-old girl from the same hometown, is studying in the third grade of Wujiang Junior High School and lives at 1024 Jiangyin Road. Her father, Yang Zanchen, is over sixty years old and also runs a winery. He has only one daughter and loves her as the apple of his eye. Although Jingwen is of marriageable age, she looks about twenty years old due to her healthy development and already understands human affairs. After getting to know Luo Shuzhi in September of last year, their feelings have become increasingly strong and they have been very intimate. Since then, they have secretly met at various inns, such as the Continental Hotel, the Dafang Hotel, and the Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan, where they have often been seen. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 17th), Luo called Jingwen again from room 317 of the Continental Hotel, saying that he wanted to say goodbye to her forever because he was in too much debt and planned to leave Shanghai. Yang, a passionate girl, was shocked to hear this and immediately hired a car to rush over. She saw Luo Shuzhi looking distressed. Two packages of sedative pills, totaling twenty pills, were placed on the table. After pouring out their hearts, she learned that he was determined to commit suicide. The girl, because she was not completely pure, was willing to die for love, so she swallowed seven pills and lay down on the bed. As it turned out, Luo ultimately did not have the courage to commit suicide and never did it. It was not until around 4:00 p.m. that Yang was found to be in abnormal condition. He hired a pedicab to send her to Hongren Hospital, where the hospital reported it to the Xincheng Police Station and ordered officers Gu Qiliu and Sergeant Xia Shutang to investigate. Before long, the woman's condition turned from danger to safety, so they were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Yang spoke frankly and told everything in detail. After the preliminary hearing, the bureau charged him with interfering with a family and inciting suicide and planned to transfer him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law.</p>
<h3>Joke by an Informant? Two Big Vats of Gold Bars Now All Feces; Prosecutor Personally Inspects Fuxing Island; No Clues Found in the Bizarre Case</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The complex and bizarre case of the theft of enemy hidden materials worth 20 million U.S. dollars from the underground of Fuxing Island has been investigated and replied by the Executive Yuan that no clues can be found. It was also stated that no personnel were sent to the island to receive it. The original informant was summoned again to the Shanghai Garrison Command, and it was replied that "there is no such person" and the subpoena was returned. The prosecuting attorney Gu Hongbiao felt that the case should not be concluded like this, and went to Fuxing Island with interpreter Yang at 6:00 a.m. yesterday to conduct an inspection. The members of the Chengye Association stationed on the island by the Executive Yuan hosted them and explained to prosecuting attorney Xian that the Agricultural Committee was not the original recipient of the island and did not find any materials. Prosecutor Gu, remembering that the informant claimed that there were two huge bathtubs filled with gold bars, asked about this. The association staff led him to inspect and confirmed that there were two large bathtubs, but they were filled with feces instead of gold bars. Coarse and fine hemp ropes were found scattered all over the ground, stretching for several miles, which was also mentioned in the informant's report. However, the Agricultural Committee staff said that the hemp ropes were transported by the Executive Yuan from Manila and there are account books to prove it, so this point cannot be regarded as a clue. The island is ten miles long and three miles wide, and land security is very strict, making it impossible for small thieves to operate, but water patrols are not easy, and theft or leakage is possible. There are many air-raid shelters on the island, and they are very well built, presumably the so-called underground tunnels, but they are all empty and no suspicious signs were found. Prosecutor Gu returned at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Rail Fracture Between Nanxiang and Huangdu; Beijing-Shanghai Night Train Almost Derailed; Railway Police Fire Shots to Warn Police to Avoid Disaster</h3>
<p>On the upper half of the night of the 17th, Zhang Xikang, a patrolling policeman from the Huangdu Station Railway Bureau, together with Wang Xiong, Chen Xinchao, Chen Dong, Dai Tongzhao, and other five traffic policemen from the station, were patrolling along the railway line. When patrolling to 25 kilometers from Huangdu, they found a rail fracture of about five or six inches. At that time, the tenth express train from Shanghai to Beijing was about to arrive at the location. The patrol police prevented derailment and were unable to notify. In a hurry, they fired dozens of shots as a warning. After the train stopped, the patrol police informed them of the situation, and the train returned to Nanxiang Station. On the one hand, they reported to Nanxiang to send workers to repair the track. The track was completely repaired at around 2:00 a.m. on the 18th. When the repairs were being made, the twelfth train from Shanghai arrived at Nanxiang Station one after another and stopped to wait. After the repair, the twelfth train departed from Nanxiang at 2:42 a.m., and the tenth train departed at 3:05 a.m., safely. Afterwards, Yan Simin, the patrol officer of the Sixth Branch Station of the Nanxiang Station Railway Police, reported by telephone on the night of the 17th that the track there had originally been cracked in the early years and had been welded by someone. Until recently, it had been too long and had been shaken by passing traffic, causing the weld to break completely. If the flaws had not been discovered this time, it would have caused a derailment. Moreover, both the tenth and twelfth trains were passenger trains, and if there had been a derailment, the damage would have been unimaginable. After receiving the report, the Xihu Section Police Station at the North Station commended the patrol police for being loyal to their duties and requested that each person be awarded a bonus of 100,000 yuan to encourage them.</p>

<h3>The Case of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Motorboat Sale: Three Defendants Released on Bail Pending Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of a small motorboat belonging to the UNRRA FS-357 transport vessel, which was stolen and sold by the ship's sailors Kai Lai, George Otto, and the Swede Nansen, the three men were handed over to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution after UNRRA became aware of the incident.

<h3>Salvaging Wartime Shipwrecks: Shipping Administration Bureau and Other Jointly-Established Companies to Hire Foreign Experts to Assist</h3>
<p>According to Li Guofan, Director of the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, the bureau, in order to salvage ships sunk during the war, has specially joined forces with the Enemy Property Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Guild, and other relevant parties to invest in and establish the China Salvage Company. After the city was liberated last year, there were plans to establish a salvage company. However, the company lacked equipment and found it difficult to recruit technical personnel, resulting in no progress. Currently, the preparatory committee of the China Salvage Company has decided to invite this salvage company to participate in cooperation and to use its equipment as investment. As for the technical aspect, the Shipping Administration Bureau is in contact with salvage expert Mr. Williams. It is reported that Mr. Williams has served in various European and American countries and specializes in salvage work. His arrival in Shanghai is due to a dispatch from UNRRA. In the future, any ships salvaged by the China Salvage Company will be investigated. If the ownership belongs to enemy or puppet assets, the Enemy Property Bureau will take over and auction them off. If the ownership belongs to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after verification, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will reclaim and repair them. In short, after the ships are salvaged, regardless of who the owner is, they must hold conclusive evidence before they can be returned. All salvage costs will be borne by the respective shipowners. Otherwise, they will be publicly auctioned.</p>

<h3>"Speaking of Painting, Closed Mouth to Art": High Court First Trial of Female Painter Li Qingping Eloquent and Articulate, Claiming No Knowledge of Supplying Information to the Enemy and Puppet Regimes, Denying Ever Acknowledging Chu Minyi as Godfather</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Female painter Li Qingping (pictured, taken by this newspaper) was requested to be arrested by the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters through a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau. Li was arrested after opening a painting exhibition at the New Life Club a month ago and sent to the High Procuratorate for investigation. She was prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held its first trial, with a large audience. Li was eloquent and articulate, repeatedly stating, "I am a painter, studying art." She firmly denied ever acknowledging Chu Minyi as her godfather and denied ever knowing Matsushima Kei and Ueda, the heads of the enemy navy's information department, or supplying political and economic information. The entire hearing lasted one hour. The court adjourned the trial for further questioning, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>At 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Zhensheng, accompanied by a clerk, entered the court and ordered the bailiffs to bring up Li Qingping. Li was wearing a collared white shirt, a navy blue Western-style short coat with colored patterns, black wool pants, champagne-colored leather shoes, her hair up, without makeup, and carrying a white handkerchief and a bundle of documents. Judge Chen first asked her age, hometown, and experience. Li replied, "Twenty-seven years old, from Jiangling, Hubei. My father is dead, and my mother is in the countryside. I have no sisters, but three brothers, all in Chongqing. My parents were both painters, and we have no property. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), I graduated from [omitted] and taught at Anhui Middle School in Zhabei, Shanghai. In the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), I was sent to Nanyang by the school because Kuncheng Girls' High School in Kuala Lumpur was seeking a teacher. I taught art and music there. When the Pacific War broke out and the area fell, I was repatriated back to China by the Overseas Chinese Repatriation Committee, arriving in Shanghai in May of the 31st year of the Republic (1942). I went to Hankou and Shashi and returned to my hometown of Jiangling, staying for about a week before returning to Shanghai."</p>
<p>The court asked, "What documents did you have when traveling to various places at that time?" She replied, "I had no documents. I always carried my paintings and declared that I was a painter, so traveling was not difficult. After returning to my hometown, I went to Yichang, wanting to enter the interior, but I needed documents, even if I declared I was a painter. So I returned to Shanghai." She continued, "After returning to Shanghai, I stayed at the Shanghai Art Academy for two months before going to Beijing and then to Hangzhou and Suzhou. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), I returned to Shanghai and opened an exhibition, staying at the home of my classmate Shen Xueqin at No. 6, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road. After four or five months, I went to Hangzhou and Suzhou again to paint. In the summer of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), I went to Beijing again until February of this year when I returned to Shanghai. In April, I went home through Hankou, stayed for two months, opened a painting exhibition in Nanjing, and returned to Shanghai on September 20th, staying at the New Life Club." The court immediately asked, "During these years, did you go back and forth with anyone? And how did you maintain your livelihood during this time of war and chaos?" She replied, "I went back and forth alone. As for the livelihood issue, I brought savings and jewelry back from Nanyang. In addition, I worked hard at painting for several years, and my results were very good, so I was able to maintain myself." Judge Chen continued, "After going to your hometown, why didn't you stay and insisted on traveling to various places?" She replied, "I couldn't buy painting materials in my hometown, and I couldn't sell my paintings after I painted them. I study Western painting and sketching, so I must go to various places to paint on location." The court asked if Li had ever acknowledged Chu Minyi as her godfather? She replied, "There is no such thing. I don't know anyone in the enemy puppet regime." Judge Chen said, "There is a document from the Hankou Police Department to prove this." Li replied, "I don't need this. My father just passed away recently, and there is no custom of acknowledging a godfather in my hometown." The court asked, "Otherwise, it wouldn't be easy to run around?" Li replied, "Why can't I run around? There were many people painting at that time." Judge Chen then asked, "Do you know Matsushima Kei and Ueda of the enemy navy's information department?" Li answered without hesitation, "I don't know them." The court asked Li, "What position did Chu Minyi hold at that time?" She replied, "I don't know. I am a painter." Judge Chen rebuked her, "You are using painting as a cover to inquire about our political and military news and supply it to the enemy?" Li, hearing this, questioned the court, "Is this speculation? Or is it a fact?" The court informed her that there was an arrest warrant from the Hankou Police Department. Li immediately answered eloquently, "Art is truth, goodness, and beauty. It won't be used by others. I have no political common sense, and I don't even know the word 'information.' What is the basis for them to arrest me like this? Please ask the Hankou agency that arrested me what agency they are based on and what reason they have?" The court then asked Li, "You must have had some friends since the 31st year of the Republic (1942). Do you have any evidence to present?" Li again replied fiercely, "No friends, nothing. Only art! I don't open empty painting exhibitions, but exhibitions with works. When selling paintings, I have never collected information. Colleagues in the art world all know that I am a painter." Chen, seeing that she was full of talk about painting and art, rebuked her sternly, "The prosecutor's indictment does not say that you are not a painter, but because you have engaged in extracurricular activities, interacted with the enemy, and supplied information." Li replied, "But I didn't!" The trial came to an end here. Li's defense lawyer then stood up and declared! "When the defendant was in Nanyang, she received a certificate of commendation for donating money for the war effort. Current government officials can also prove that the defendant is not a traitor. There are also group introductions for her to open a painting exhibition, which can be used as evidence." After speaking, he presented a letter of introduction for the painting exhibition signed by prominent figures and other documents. Li herself requested the court to grant her bail. Judge Chen replied, "I'm afraid it won't be easy. I can't make the decision alone. You must submit a written petition and wait for the collegiate bench to decide." Li left the court and spoke briefly with her cousin before being escorted back to the women's prison by the bailiffs.</p>

<h3>"Black Hat" Case of Assault Resulting in Death During the Enemy Puppet Period: High Court Re-Prosecutes on Charges of Treason; Jiang Shiyan Abuses Power and Claims Ignorance; Judge Angrily Condemns Him as a "Bad Thing"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Shiyan (pictured, taken by this newspaper), from Yancheng, is currently twenty-one years old. During the occupation of Shanghai, he served as the deputy squad leader in charge of security at the Shanghai North Station of the puppet Central China Railway Company. On the morning of March 4th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he beat female passenger Xu Peiwen to death at the North Station, resulting in the "Black Hat" outrage that shocked the city. After the incident, Jiang fled in fear of punishment and was eventually arrested in Qishuyan. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the puppet court at the time. After the victory, the High Court prosecutor reinvestigated the case and prosecuted him on October 7th of this year. During the trial, due to the defendant's service in an organization belonging to the enemy puppet regime, abusing his power, and harming the people, he was charged with crimes under Article 278 of the Criminal Law and Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. He was additionally prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor.</p>
<p>The case was brought to trial by Judge Qiu Huan of the High Court yesterday afternoon. Jiang was wearing a striped black cloth short cotton-padded jacket, blue cloth pants, a flat-top haircut, and was short in stature, wearing black cloth shoes. He testified, "I graduated from junior high school at Yancheng Middle School and joined the puppet Central China Railway Company on October 5th of the 29th year of the Republic (1940)." Judge Qiu immediately asked, "Since you are a middle school student, why did you become a traitor?" He replied, "I was forced to. I didn't have enough money to go to the interior." The court then asked about the incident of Xu Peiwen being beaten to death. He replied, "I neither knew Xu nor had any grievances with her. On the morning of March 4th, I was maintaining order at the military ticket window No. 3. The line of ticket buyers was very long. Xu Peiwen cut in the middle of the line without queuing. I initially advised her not to, but she didn't listen. When I went to drag her away, she still refused. I wanted to drag her into the stationmaster's office, but she refused to go and bit me instead. I grabbed her collar. At that time, the stationmaster, a Japanese named Sanben, came and took her away. I don't know what happened after that." The court asked, "You beat her with a leather whip and kicked her with your feet." He replied, "There is no such thing at all. Leather whips were used by the military. I didn't kick her either. At this time, the stationmaster had already arrived. In front of my superior, I couldn't beat people indiscriminately. That's what happened. There isn't a word of a lie." Judge Qiu then presented the defendant's previous written confession. After Jiang read it, he replied, "That's not right. It's completely fabricated." The court asked again, "What happened to Xu Peiwen after she was injured?" He replied, "When I left, Xu showed no signs of injury. I didn't know anything about her being sent to the hospital." Judge Qiu then said, "Xu Peiwen was sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium, which cost 200,000 yuan for the operation and 60,000 yuan in fees. You borrowed 150,000 yuan from your colleagues as compensation because you were afraid it would involve people." Jiang replied, "There is no such thing at all." The court then asked, "Then why did you flee after the incident?" He replied, "I didn't flee. I continued to work as usual on the 5th and 6th of March after the incident on the 4th. I took leave on the 7th to go to Qishuyan for business, not to flee." Asked, "Did you know that Xu Peiwen died?" He replied, "I don't know." Finally asked, "Is there anything else you want to say?" He replied, "It's completely unjust. You say I beat someone to death, but there are no witnesses." Judge Qiu told him, "Traitors are all bad." Jiang, hearing this, argued, "There are good ones among the bad." Judge Qiu immediately said, "You are one of the bad ones." The case was adjourned for further questioning. When the defendant was talking to his family, the court instructed the bailiffs to keep a close watch on Jiang because he was a murderer. After talking with his family, he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Meeting Venue: Executive Yuan Has Telegraphed Reply</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's meeting venue, which was previously resolved by the General Assembly to rent the original site of the former Japanese Autonomous Association on Peng Road from the Enemy Property Bureau, could not be decided because the Enemy Property Bureau had a lease contract with the U.S. military authorities for the building, which was originally due to expire on the 14th of this month, but could be extended for three months after the expiration date.

If the Racecourse can be recovered, the location would be most suitable, and Zhongshan Hall may be built in the Racecourse. It is learned that the equipment standards proposed by the Executive Yuan for Zhongshan Hall are as follows: (1) The building of Zhongshan Hall should have a main hall and a small conference room. (2) The statue or portrait of Sun Yat-sen should be enshrined in the main hall of Zhongshan Hall, inscribed with "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Honor" inside and "Zhongshan Hall" outside. (3) If the funds for Zhongshan Hall are sufficient, Sun Yat-sen's testamentary instruction and the Twelve Maxims should be carved on stone and placed on the four walls. (4) If the scope of Zhongshan Hall is large, two separate rooms can be set aside, one for storing local specialties (including excellent handicrafts, etc.) and the other for storing local literature (county chronicles, customs, etc.) and portraits and records of local officials and civilians who have made meritorious contributions to the locality throughout the ages and generals who have contributed to the National Revolution and the War of Resistance. (5) A plaza should be built outside the main gate of Zhongshan Hall, and a stage should be set up beside the gate for outdoor gatherings. A gymnasium should be set up for public sports use. (6) Zhongshan Hall must have a standard clock and thermometer, and it must also have a large bell so that the sound of the bell can be heard throughout the area. A flagpole should be erected on the plaza, and equipment such as flags should be provided. (7) Zhongshan Hall should establish Zhongshan Hospital, a social service center, and various legitimate entertainment venues, depending on its resources. (8) Trees should be planted and forests should be created near Zhongshan Hall, depending on the terrain. (9) The location of Zhongshan Hall should be chosen to be convenient. (10) Zhongshan Hall may appropriately set aside office space for the Party Department to assist in promoting the Party's work. (11) The construction of Zhongshan Hall should prioritize "simplicity, solidity," "solemnity, and grandeur" so that it can be passed down for a long time and inspire awe.</p>

<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Induced Sale Contract</p>
<p>Ye Jinguo asks: My father passed away in 1940. Due to financial difficulties, I sold the family property in the countryside to Lu, a fellow villager, for 3,000 legal tender. I received 1,600 yuan as a down payment, with the remaining balance to be paid later. However, when I went to collect the remaining amount, he denied everything. I then realized I had been tricked.  When the contract was signed, I was not yet an adult and was coerced into making an "X" mark on the contract. I also did not carefully examine the contents of the contract. Now, I have several questions to ask for clarification: (1) Is a contract signed by a 16-year-old child legally binding? (2) Is a contract signed during the enemy-puppet era legally binding? (3) Can I sue Lu for fraud?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies]: (1) If there is no signature from a legal guardian, it is not valid. (2) If there is no coercion or fraud, it is valid. (3) You must have concrete evidence of fraud to file a lawsuit.</p>
<p>(2) Overdue Debt</p>
<p>Ling Fusheng asks: A borrowed ten dan of rice from B, with a written agreement stipulating repayment of fifteen dan, including interest, in five months. A guarantor signed and stamped the agreement as a witness. However, B failed in business and could not repay the debt on time, while A is now demanding repayment from me. I have the following questions to ask for clarification: (1) What responsibility does the guarantor bear if B cannot repay the debt on time? (2) Is the guarantor required to compensate if B is unable to repay the debt? (3) If the loan was not arranged by the guarantor, can the guarantor's responsibility be reduced? (4) How should I deal with A's unreasonable demands for repayment?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies]: (1) (3) The guarantor is not responsible for repayment! (2) No. (4) You can only assist in urging repayment. If there is any infringement of freedom, you can seek legal recourse.</p>
<h3>The Poor Show Compassion for Each Other</h3>
<p>Emergency Surgery Saves Two Patients</p>
<p>Zhang Chaogeng, a worker at the Da Zhonghua Shoe Factory in this city, from Yin County, Zhejiang, residing at No. 69, Lane 456, Jianguo West Road, has suffered from stomach problems for many years without a cure. On the 4th of this month, his condition worsened, causing unbearable pain. He sought treatment at the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, where doctors diagnosed him with a perforated stomach and required surgery. With a monthly income of just over 100,000 yuan, Zhang was already struggling to support his family and could not afford the surgery. Therefore, the hospital's social services department applied for emergency assistance funds from this organization on his behalf. His application has been approved. Zhang's condition has greatly improved since the surgery, and he was discharged from the hospital yesterday.</p>
<p>Zheng A'kui, from Yin County, 36 years old, residing at No. 7, Yongxing Lane, Zhujia Ku, Huashan Road, was previously a partner at a cloth store. Recently, due to the impact of foreign goods dumping, business in the store declined, and he was laid off. Zheng has suffered from stomach problems for quite some time, and recently his stomach wall perforated and ulcerated, resulting in significant bleeding. On the 26th of last month, he was taken by his family to the First Hospital of the Red Cross Society for treatment. After a blood transfusion and wound closure, his condition improved significantly. He is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a few days. His application for emergency assistance funds has also been approved.</p>
<h3>Seeking Information</h3>
<p>Seeking Sister and Brother: Zhang Lintao's sister joined a guerrilla unit with him during the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, fighting the enemy in the Jinhua-Xiaoshan area. He has not heard from her since 1943. His younger brother, Zhang Peixun, from Minhou County, Fujian, followed the cadet corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs led by Regiment Commander Lin Guanxiong to fight in Myanmar during the Anti-Japanese War. He has also lost contact after the victory. If any kind individuals can provide information about their whereabouts, it would be deeply appreciated to reunite the family.  Respectfully, Zhang Peichang.</p>
<p>Seeking Hu Hairu: Also known as Yuchun, he left home three years ago and has not been heard from since. The whole family is anxious. Please contact Hu Ruisheng at Xinhua Bank in Nanjing if anyone knows of his whereabouts. Your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Nantong Luo Sanze Seeks Son: Editor, I am old and frail, and I know I will not live much longer. Sadly, I have worked hard all my life but have no relatives to rely on. My wife is deceased, my son is gone, and my house is in ruins. My youngest son, Dezhen, was a student at the Artillery School of the Nanjing Shangzhe River Fortress before the war. After the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, he joined the Nantong County Anti-Japanese Student Brigade and moved north with the army. He has been wandering since then. I received two letters from him, detailing the hardships he faced along the way. In the spring of 1941, I received another letter from him in Xi'an, stating that he had been promoted to deputy regimental commander with the rank of major. As a father who had a son in his old age, I was proud that he could serve the country loyally, which would not betray my patriotic heart. Since then, I have not heard from him for five years. Although the Anti-Japanese War was won a long time ago, I do not know where my son is, and his fate is uncertain. I beg you to publish this in your newspaper. Your kindness would be like a second life. I write with sorrow and cannot express all that I want to say. Please accept my respects.  Respectfully, Luo Sanze from Nantong.</p>

<h3>Ban on Off-Exchange Trading Causes Stagnation in Shanghai Yesterday - Only 20 Bundles of Hong Kui Star Yarn Sold Slightly - Fourth Allotment of Yarn Scheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Cotton Yarn Trade Association, in order to implement a ban on illegal off-exchange trading, convened a temporary meeting of directors the night before yesterday to discuss and decide on the following measures: (1) All transactions among members must be conducted on the exchange from now on. Those who deliberately trade illegally off-exchange will be reported to the police for arrest by the association, which will also dispatch more staff to strictly monitor activities. (2) Members must immediately fill out a form upon completing a transaction on the exchange, detailing the quantity of cotton yarn sold and reported, whether for wholesale, retail, or self-use. These forms will be registered by the association. (3) The association will compile statistics based on the registered transaction volumes. Shipments to other locations will be notified to the Textile Control Board (紡管) for verification and release.  After these measures were announced, the exchange was unusually quiet yesterday, with very few attendees. Only 221 bundles of Hong Kui Star 20-count yarn were sold slightly, with no other activity reported. The Textile Control Board dispatched personnel to the market yesterday morning to monitor trading. The cotton yarn market on the first floor of Ningbo Road has been closed, with all transactions restricted to the ground floor. Openly displayed market prices were not announced, and the market report from the Liaison Society (聯誼社) was also not published. The yarn market is in a state of stagnation. According to the association, off-exchange trading in the past was mostly conducted in alleys, with middlemen acting as outside brokers. The association found it difficult to monitor activities, making it impossible to prevent illegal trading. At the same time, cotton yarn shipments to locations outside of South China can be freely transported without Textile Control Board approval, potentially leading to indirect shipments to South China. This is also a major reason for the flourishing off-exchange trading.</p>
<p>Fourth Yarn Allotment - Types Decided</p>
<p>The types and quantities of yarn for the fourth allotment of the third phase of the Joint Allotment Committee (聯合配銷會) have now been finalized. The total amount is 5,535 bundles (including 1,467 bundles from the Spinning Construction Company). This includes 926 bundles of 10-count yarn, 26 bundles of 12-count yarn, 638 bundles of 16-count yarn, 2,549 bundles of 20-count yarn, 350 bundles of 32-count yarn, 119 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 477 bundles of 40-count yarn, 423 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 60-count yarn, 10 bundles of 64-count double-ply yarn, 4 bundles of 80-count variable-ply yarn, and 3 bundles of 80-count three-ply yarn. The equivalent 20-count allocation for all types is 5,800.6 bundles (including 2,000.5 bundles from the Spinning Construction Company). This matches the standard allotment amount of 6,000 bundles (including 2,001 bundles from the Spinning Construction Company).</p>
<p>Re-Allotment Committee Explains Reasons for Returns</p>
<p>The Re-Allotment Committee (複配會) has addressed the return of orders in previous allotments. In the third allotment, there were still 897 returned bundles, but 500 of these were unsuitable 10-count yarn, which the Re-Allotment Committee returned upon receiving the allocation list. The remaining 397 bundles included various counts. According to the Re-Allotment Committee, there are two main reasons for the return of yarn allotments: (1) The six trade associations of the reproduction industry (複製品工業) currently have a total of 1,889 factories eligible for allotments. Allotments are generally based on the level of production equipment and operating conditions. In the third allotment, due to returns of unsuitable yarn counts and combined allotments reported by members, the allotment quantity for each factory was reduced to 50% of the requested amount. It is inevitable that a small number of factories would return allotments due to unsuitable yarn counts or insufficient funds. However, the total number of returns does not indicate a surplus. (2) The original deadline for payment was Thursday to Saturday, but the third allotment deadline was moved forward to Friday without prior consultation between the Textile Control Board and the Re-Allotment Committee. This resulted in a significant number of last-minute returns. However, a small portion was accepted on Saturday after the Re-Allotment Committee consulted with the Allotment Committee. The Re-Allotment Committee has informed Mayor Wu that the increase in black market yarn prices and the return of allotments are evidence that the allotted yarn is not being diverted into the black market.</p>
<h3>Trust Bureau Auctions of Cotton Yarn - All Handled by the Textile Control Board</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday:  An emergency meeting was recently convened with all relevant parties in the cotton yarn industry to discuss several measures to completely eliminate the cotton yarn black market and to ensure their implementation. The difficulties faced by manufacturers and the Re-Allotment Committee regarding joint allocation are currently being addressed. The quality standards of all yarn counts must be met for each factory's allotment. If deficiencies in count or quality are discovered, the allotment price must be reduced in proportion to the current agreed price. Mayor Wu has also obtained the consent of Liu Gongyun, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, to hand over all cotton yarn regularly auctioned by the Bureau to the Textile Control Board for distribution. The Textile Control Board will provide a detailed list of the Bureau's entire cotton yarn selection, including colors, counts, brands, and types, for each trade association to select and purchase according to the Textile Control Board's agreed price.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Banks Receive New Instructions - No Foreign Exchange Sales or Settlements Without Import Licenses</h3>
<p>The Central Bank notified all designated foreign exchange banks on the 18th with Circular No. 61, stating that after the promulgation of the revised interim measures for import and export trade on the same day, all current regulations of the Central Bank for the designated banks should be modified.</p>
<p>(1) Central Bank Circulars No. 1, 26, 45, 45 (bis), and 54 (except paragraph 6) are canceled with immediate effect.</p>
<p>(2) From now on, designated banks may not sell foreign exchange for imported goods or accept the settlement of foreign exchange for imported goods to foreign exchange applicants who do not have an import license permitting their import.</p>
<p>(3) According to Article 1 of the "Interim Measures for Import and Export Trade," regarding foreign exchange transactions, the Central Bank remains the sole agency for conveying all regulations to the designated banks for all matters related to international trade. For the sake of expediency and public convenience, designated banks may directly contact the relevant departments of the Temporary Import Management Committee (輸入臨時管理委員會) regarding the application for import licenses.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Grain Prices Surge - Due to Procurement in Wuxi from Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi] Grain prices in this county have suddenly surged today because Zhejiang Province is purchasing 100,000 dan of indica and japonica rice from Wuxi. Glutinous rice is 58,000 yuan per dan, white japonica is 51,000 yuan per dan, Yang indica is 48,000 yuan per dan, japonica rice is 22,000 yuan per dan, indica rice is 19,000 yuan per dan, and glutinous rice is 25,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Steps Down, Gold Price Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's "Shat Chih" (烚赤) market fluctuated.  Opening at 2.502 million, selling pressure emerged from 2.51 million onward, leading to fatigue and profit-taking. The 2.5 million level was broken, and the Central Bank allocated 200 taels at a price of 2.4975 million. After 10 a.m., demand was weak, and the price retreated to a low of 2.483 million before being supported by actual sales. The price gradually stabilized, and the situation was relatively stable near noon, hovering around 2.495 million. The afternoon was extremely calm, with the forward price remaining around the noon price. As a result, the closing price was slightly down by 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was listed at 264,000, unchanged. Silver remained flat, and silver dollars fell slightly. Secret interest rates ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies continued to weaken, with sellers outnumbering buyers and prices gradually declining. The black market price of the US dollar immediately fell to 4,630 to 4,680 yuan after the market opened. Sellers were eager to sell, and the price continued to fall, dropping to around 4,550 yuan by noon, a decrease of over 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the rise in telegram rates to Shanghai, Hong Kong dollars rose to 108 yuan, but buyers were scarce, and the price fell significantly. The closing price was down by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate also fell to 915 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 11,100 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 14,800 yuan, all being selling prices. Only Hong Kong exchange saw some trading, while the rest were stagnant.</p>
<h3>Will the US Dollar Become Useless? The Key Lies in Whether Private Smuggling Can Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the black market price of the US dollar traded around 4,550 yuan, with very few transactions. Observers point out that if the import permit system is effectively implemented and smuggling is severely cracked down on, the US dollar will become useless and its price will continue to fall. The reason for the sharp rise in the US dollar black market price to as high as 4,900 yuan in the past few days was reportedly due to the arrival of six foreign freighters, fully loaded with goods. A group of resourceful import and export merchants, finding it difficult to obtain foreign exchange approval from the Central Bank, bought US dollars on the market at high prices, and speculators took the opportunity to spread rumors, causing prices to rise to unprecedented levels. However, the current surge has passed. With the implementation of the new measures, the demand for US dollars has been greatly reduced. In the past, the so-called smuggling was because the Central Bank did not approve foreign exchange but Customs allowed imports, so merchants bought US dollars on the market as a payment method. Under the current permit system, the Central Bank will supply foreign exchange for all goods that are permitted to be imported. Conversely, Customs will not allow the import of goods that are not permitted to be imported, even if private individuals hold foreign exchange payment instruments. In this situation, even if the government still allows the free use of US dollars in our country, it will not be able to cause trouble and destabilize prices. Currently, the Central Bank has issued earnest warnings to the banking association to prevent commercial banks from engaging in black market US dollar transactions. For example, if a telephone is used to arrange US dollar transactions, the telephone line will be cut off upon discovery. There are many similar preventive measures. A reporter asked whether speculators who accumulate large amounts of US dollars will decrease in the future. The answer was: These speculators often borrow funds to buy US dollars, which results in a heavy interest burden. If the US dollar market price remains stable for a long time or even declines, they will find it unprofitable and will inevitably sell off large amounts. This will drastically reduce the demand for US dollars and greatly increase the supply, causing prices to fall further.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Step Down</h3>
<p>Trading in government bonds was sluggish yesterday, with only slightly over 3 million [yuan] in transactions. The overall Type C bonds opened at 1,550 yuan in the morning.  Large investors were eagerly seeking supply, but given the unfavorable environment, the market trend turned downward, gradually declining to close within the 1,500 yuan range. As a result, the closing price was down 150 yuan compared to the previous day. Types A, B, and D also fell by 150 yuan, while Type E fell by 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Subsidized Vegetable Oil Prices Have Been Increased - Soybean Oil at 1,450 Yuan Per Jin - Northeast Soybeans Shipped to Shanghai for Oil Extraction</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting on subsidized vegetable oil prices at 3 p.m. yesterday, presided over by Mr. Ji Mingzhai, head of the Grain and Food Department of the Bureau. Those in attendance included Mr. Cao Bingqian, a special commissioner of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mr. Li Tingdong of the National Vegetable Oil Factory, Mr. Xie Yuxiang of the Da Youyu Private Vegetable Oil Factory, Mr. Lu Jiannan of Weimin, Mr. Cai Bosuo of Changde, Mr. He Shuming of Shunyu, Mr. Zhang Chao of the Da Chang, Xin Zhou Wei Bo, the Shanghai Food Oil Retailers Association, and Mr. Yang Mingzhou of the Food Oil and Cake Association. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Ji Mingzhai first reported that Premier Song was very concerned about the vegetable oil issue in Shanghai. He decided to supply soybeans to each factory and facilitate the circulation of funds for each factory. He also made arrangements to increase the electricity allowance for each oil extraction factory to reduce production costs and encourage the transportation and sale of vegetable oil.</p>
<p>The price discussion then began.  Nationalized, private factories, and transportation and sales merchants all presented cost sheets.  After detailed research, it was decided to review and determine the prices as follows: Soybean oil at 133,000 yuan, rapeseed oil at 129,000 yuan, sesame oil at 129,000 yuan, light oil at 124,000 yuan, pure raw oil at 128,000 yuan, and barrel raw oil at 135,000 yuan. The retail prices at the point of sale are soybean oil at 145,000 yuan, rapeseed oil at 140,000 yuan, sesame oil at 140,000 yuan, light oil at 134,000 yuan, pure raw oil at 150,000 yuan, and barrel raw oil at 150,000 yuan. The price per jin (斤) can be extrapolated proportionally. For example, soybean oil is 1,450 yuan per jin, rapeseed oil is 1,400 yuan per jin, and raw oil is 1,500 yuan per jin. The above prices will be implemented starting today.</p>
<p>It is also reported that each oil extraction factory requested the Central Trust Bureau to ship the 200,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast that the Central Trust Bureau has in its possession, in batches to the south for oil extraction. Currently, the Central Trust Bureau has already shipped 1,200 tons of soybeans from Yingkou to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive within a few days. It is said that each factory hopes that the Central Trust Bureau can sell the soybeans at a price of 29,000 yuan per dan.  Today, the Da Youyu Factory will send Mr. Xie Yuxiang to negotiate with Mr. He Molin, the manager of the Purchasing and Barter Department of the Bureau.</p>
<p>Joint Oil Allocation Continues</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vegetable Oil Joint Distribution Office continued to receive 400 dan of oil allocated from various private factories yesterday.  This includes 80 dan from Da Chang Xin, 52 dan from Changde, 48 dan from Shunyu, 64 dan from Da De Xin, 16 dan from Da Sheng, and 12 dan from Weimin. All of the above is soybean oil. Da Youyu was allocated 128 dan of raw rapeseed oil. The office distributed the oil to 115 retail oil stores in the Nanshi district, with each store receiving 3.5 dan. It is said that from today, the daily allocation and sale from each private factory will be increased to 500 dan. At the same time, in order to ensure widespread supply, the city government has borrowed 3,000 dan of raw oil from the China Food Oil Company and handed it over to the office for general distribution. The plan will be decided today, and the oil will be available for general retail sale in each retail store within three to four days.</p>
<p>Since the office started registering retail oil stores, the total number of registered stores is 1,429. However, due to manpower and time constraints, the office can only distribute to slightly over 100 stores each day. Therefore, the remaining 1,000 plus retail stores will be allocated by district each day, and they will be notified in writing before the allocation. All registered retailers will receive an allocation sooner or later, so please do not make unnecessary trips before receiving notification.</p>

Mr. Chang Yinpu, the manager of the business department of the Securities Exchange, attended to report on the handover and submission situation and the city government's crackdown on black market transactions. The board then discussed four requests raised by the brokers and decided on the following: (1) The handover will be changed to start from the market before every Thursday. (2) The 30% margin for handover can be fully offset with substitutes, but this will be implemented after approval from the Ministry. (3) The 50 million yuan cash guarantee of identity can be changed to three substitutes, which is still awaiting approval from the Ministry. (4) The guarantee of identity cannot be transferred to the registration guarantee of handover because of the different natures.

<p>Wujin is located in the center of the Beijing-Shanghai line and has always been a distribution area for local cloth production and sales. Before the war against Japan, various dyeing and weaving factories had more than 7,000 electric looms. After the victory, 70 factories were repaired and resumed production, with more than 4,500 looms in operation. The daily demand for raw cotton yarn is more than 280 bales, or 8,500 bales per month. They produce fine cloth and twill, which is sold in Shanghai and as far as the southwestern provinces. Although Wujin has two yarn factories, Dacheng and Minfeng, which spin yarn, their sales are very small except for their own weaving. Wujin cloth factories have been relying on the supply from private yarn factories in eight cities and counties, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Tongzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Chongming, and Taicang. Now, due to the price-limited distribution of cotton yarn implemented by Wu, the concurrent chairman of the Spinning Control Commission, to eliminate the black market, only the Mubu area has received allocations, while other areas are still disappointed. The Wujin County Dyeing and Weaving Factory Industry Association noted that Shanghai dyeing and weaving industries have received limited-price cotton yarn allocations, but Wujin cloth factories still purchase cotton yarn on the black market, resulting in higher costs and difficulty in sales. Therefore, Cha Bingchu, chairman of the industry association, along with several directors and supervisors, went to Shanghai to submit a petition to the Spinning Control Commission, requesting to participate in the allocation program and receive the same treatment to maintain their survival. They also pointed out that the Wujin weaving industry has always relied on Shanghai for raw material supplies. Now that they are not receiving allocations, it is bound to create a black market. If the black market is to be eliminated, a comprehensive plan is necessary; otherwise, not only will Wujin cloth factories be forced to shut down, but it will also encourage yarn factories to evade domestic sales.</p>
<h3>Speculative Sentiment Prevalent; Difficult for Chinese Stocks to Improve</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks generally fluctuated yesterday. All stocks opened lower in the morning, causing unease among investors. Numbers 199 and 143 were sold off, lacking support, and the selling pressure persisted, leading to a gradual decline. Yong Yarn for current delivery fell to 574 yuan. Numbers 87, 198, and 171 were actively supported. Around 10:30 AM, with light volume, there was a rebound of a dozen yuan after hitting a low, but the rally was hampered by continued selling of numbers 84, 89, 83, and 27, making it difficult to gain momentum. There were repeated struggles at the lower levels. Starting from 11:45 AM, there was increased activity in covering short positions. Number 38 aggressively bought Yong Yarn, and Number 151 also entered the market. Numbers 152, 198, and 232 bought Xinyi, turning the sentiment more stable. The market closed relatively stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinyi, and Jingfu all fell by 3.33%, while Xinguang and Dongxing remained flat. Cold stocks such as cement saw slight gains, while others fell by a small margin up to 0.5%. Yonggong saw no trades for current delivery, while others experienced slight declines. In the afternoon, the market was once again pressured lower by off-exchange sellers. Short-selling activity on the trading floor was limited. Numbers 229, 89, and 38 sold off, causing all stocks to fall again. However, there was some support after the decline, and there was a brief rally near the close. Xinyi and Meiya showed signs of being squeezed for current delivery. For current delivery, Yong Yarn was only a few yuan away from the cash price. Besides Yong Yarn and Xinyi, almost no one paid attention to other stocks in the market, creating a desolate situation. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Xinyi each fell by 4%, Xinguang rose slightly, while Jingfu and Qinxing fell slightly. Cold stocks such as Datong saw some acquisition of shares and rose slightly, along with cement. The rest fell slightly up to 0.5%. For current delivery, besides Yonggong, which had no trades and no price quotations, Yong Yarn, Xinyi, and Meiya each fell by more than 0.5%, while Jingfu and Xinguang fell only slightly. Off-exchange stocks saw little change.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks turned sideways after the initial decline, with British and Allied Industries and Guang Steel showing relative stability. Trading volume was low, and the market opened very late. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shipping, Paper, Jardine Matheson, and Hong Kong Brewery and Distillery saw slight declines, while others remained flat.</p>
<h3>Extension of Household Registration Deadline by Three Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau convened over ten responsible individuals from the South Goods Industry Association at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss three issues regarding sugar allocation: (1) Due to the weight of the bag, there is a shortage of 40,000 catties of sugar for all stores in the city during this allocation. It was decided that Taiwan Sugar Corporation would provide 30,000 catties for free as compensation, and the remaining 10,000 catties would be purchased by the South Goods Industry Association at a price of 800 yuan per catty. (2) The original regulation stipulated that each sugar bag should weigh 5 catties, but the bags received actually weighed 6.5 catties, resulting in a difference of 1.5 catties per bag and a total shortage of 30,000 catties for the city. It was decided that Taiwan Sugar Corporation would replenish the shortage. (3) Zhang Jingan, the head of the 18th bao in the 25th district, failed to distribute sugar allocation certificates according to regulations. It was decided that the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government would be responsible for taking disciplinary action. As for the substandard sugar issued by Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the company will be responsible for replacing it. Furthermore, some citizens have not yet received their certificates, so it has been decided to extend the deadline for three days until the 22nd. The date for the second allocation has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>Shanghai University Prepares for Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>Invites Dr. H.H. Kung to Deliver a Speech</p>
<p>Saturday, the 23rd of this month, is the 40th anniversary of Shanghai University. Dr. Wei Fulan, the first American president of Shanghai University, made the greatest sacrifices. Dr. Liu Zhanen, the second president, was brutally murdered by the enemy puppets in the early stages of the War of Resistance for spreading news of Japanese atrocities in China to Europe and the United States, sacrificing his life for the country. The current president, Ling Xianyang, was originally the general manager of the Central Printing Plant. Due to the support of alumni, he took over as president. Because of President Ling's enthusiasm for education, he launched a 20 million yuan restoration fund campaign in early summer this year, which is now nearing success. Future progress can be predicted. Many Shanghai University alumni are distributed in financial and business institutions. Even within the four banks and two bureaus of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, the China Trust Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, many of the internal staff are Shanghai University alumni. It is reported that in addition to inviting Dr. H.H. Kung to deliver a speech at this 40th-anniversary celebration, alumni and students will enthusiastically participate. The alumni association is contributing 1.2 million yuan specifically for the "fireworks display" program. In addition, male and female students will also perform plays. On the evening of that day, thousands of alumni and students will hold gongs and lanterns, one per person, and set off fireworks to celebrate.

<h3>Nationally Approved Textbooks Not Fully Liberalized; Elementary School Textbooks Still Fully Adopt Nationally Approved Versions; Some Secondary School Textbooks Are Compiled by Various Publishing Houses and Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Representatives from the Ministry of Education and eleven publishing houses held a meeting at the Ministry of Education at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th, with more than twenty people in attendance, chaired by Hang Liwu, to discuss the joint printing and supply of primary and secondary school textbooks and to listen to the opinions of representatives from various publishing houses. The joint contract of the eleven publishing houses expires at the end of March next year. Whether to renew the contract will be decided by the Ministry of Education after reviewing and determining the methods, which will then be announced and implemented.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] According to the person in charge of the primary and secondary school textbook section of the Ministry of Education, the previous reports in various newspapers that primary and secondary school textbooks were completely liberalized were inaccurate rumors. The Ministry of Education designated seven publishing houses during the war and added four more after the victory, for a total of eleven publishing houses, to jointly supply nationally approved primary and secondary school textbooks. For primary schools, nationally approved textbooks will continue to be fully adopted. For secondary schools, the "Humanities" and "Natural Sciences" subjects will be treated differently: the "Humanities" subject will continue to fully use nationally approved textbooks, while the "Natural Sciences" subject may be liberalized, with popular publishing houses compiling textbooks according to the curriculum and teaching material standards promulgated by the Ministry and submitting them for review. After the contracts of the eleven publishing houses expire in March next year, the Ministry of Education will make appropriate plans on how to conditionally and partially liberalize the market while maintaining the supply of primary and secondary school textbooks during the transition period.</p>

<h3>Black and White Team's Basketball Luck Lacking; Loses to Encas Again Yesterday; Only Two Points Separate the Teams at 37-39</h3>
<p>The Fei Dao Black and White basketball team's luck continues to be lacking. In their fourth game in Shanghai last night, they lost to the Western Encas team by a score of 37-39, with only two points separating the teams. In the first half, Encas took the lead 17-13. Only about a thousand spectators attended the game at the Municipal Gymnasium last night. Cai Tingkai, the famous anti-Japanese general of the former 19th Route Army, also attended. The game was close throughout, with Black and White taking the lead in the first quarter, but they were unable to maintain it and gradually fell behind.

Black and White called a timeout five times to reduce their momentum. Guo Guoye and Fu Yongxin then scored through a combination of shots and free throws, reducing the deficit to 32-37. At this point, Li Jinzao fouled out for the fifth time and was replaced by Lin Ziyi. Lin made a long shot, reducing the difference to just one basket. Encas called a timeout, substituting Gebeng Qiguofu for V. Kailuosiji. Bao Lai made a layup, and Cai Jindian immediately retaliated.

<h3>Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Counties and Cities: Should Be Handled Seriously According to Law</h3>
<p>City Government Follows Order to Notify Subordinates</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received an order from the Executive Yuan stating: "The public funds and properties of counties and cities are important local financial resources. Since the work of reorganizing local autonomy finances began in the 32nd year of the Republic, provinces, counties, and cities have been implementing the 'Provisional Regulations for Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Provinces, Counties, and Cities' (now the 'Regulations for Properly Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Counties and Cities') promulgated by the Yuan. The funds and properties have been increasing daily, with some positive results. However, this cleanup work was carried out during wartime, making it difficult to be thorough. Occupied areas were also unable to implement it due to factual constraints. Even when it was carried out sporadically, the gains and losses of the county were unstable, causing what was cleared out to be submerged again. Now that the War of Resistance has ended in victory and constitutional government is about to be implemented, in order to make the local financial foundation healthier and achieve self-sufficiency, counties and cities should actively and earnestly handle the cleanup of public funds and properties according to the 'Regulations for Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Counties and Cities,' ensuring that all public funds and properties of counties and cities are returned to the public without any concealment, thereby increasing local financial resources. Furthermore, according to the promulgated 'Measures for Leasing Public Properties,' tenants are not allowed to fraudulently claim rent or sublet. However, it is reported that many counties and cities allow people to fraudulently claim rent for public properties that are leased through bidding according to the law, and then sublet them, which not only violates regulations but also affects the management and revenue of public properties. All provinces should be ordered to strictly prohibit this in order to comply with the regulations." It is reported that the Municipal Government has issued orders to its subordinates after receiving the order.</p>

<h3>Dark Clouds Lock Inside and Outside Tongguan</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Xi'an Airmail, 11th</p>
<p>Why are the soldiers so hurried, building the Tongguan road?</p>
<p>The large city is stronger than iron, the small city is ten thousand feet high.</p>
<p>May I ask the Tongguan official: Is repairing the pass also to prepare for the barbarians?</p>
<p>——Du Shaoling</p>
<p>Negotiations in Shanghai and Nanjing, a full-scale war throughout the country; dark clouds tightly locked inside and outside Tongguan. The people are increasingly sinking into the abyss of poverty and distress, their sorrow and indignation soaring into the heavens.</p>
<p>The north is early cold, flocks of geese fly south, their cries are very sad, passing through the windy sand that covers the ground. Late autumn is already like early winter, and the fur coat is no longer warm. The old Tongguan post, the railway is repaired in a rush, lacking materials, and the construction is sloppy, so travelers are in danger and suffer greatly. This reporter traveled through the Central Plains and the Three Qin regions, abandoning the plane and taking the train to cross Tongguan, sharing the suffering of the people, feeling a sense of self-satisfaction, and taking it as a joy. From Zhengzhou to Xi'an, the same train included gentlemen from the inspection team of the Ministry of Transportation, with extensive knowledge. They were dispatched by Mr. Yu Dawei to inspect various lines. The reporter asked if there were railways in the world today like the Longhai Railway. They offered no direct answer, but lamented the distress of Chinese engineers, saying that they had nothing to do.</p>
<p>The 588 kilometers between Zhengzhou and Xi'an took two days and nights, a total of 40 hours. Travelers described their exhaustion and misery, the cold air in the car was overwhelming, and they spoke of the country with sighs, followed by laughter. When experiencing the suffering of the journey, everyone showed extreme patience. Perhaps they were entrusting deep sorrow to humor. The weakening of the Chinese national character did not begin today, and those who call for tempering and striving may not have noticed the root causes. Crises are everywhere, making people tremble! There were students from the Northwest Associated University on the train, sons of the three great families of Thailand, feeling that employment was difficult, and even studying abroad was full of obstacles. The reporter comforted them with "nothing to do," trying to share their feelings.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway passes through Luoyang and Shanzhou, crossing Tongguan, and relies on the Xiao Han of the Funiu Mountains. Zhongnan Mountain is the spine of the Northern Range, and the Funiu and Xiao Han are its limbs. Following the road westward, the terrain gradually rises, overlooking the Yellow River, which is rushing north, striking the Shandong hills, with a myriad of sights. The "Historical Records" mentioned the solidity of Xiao Han when discussing the situation of the Three Qin, referring to the area east of Tongguan. Passing Mianchi and entering the territory of Shanzhou, Zhangmao Station is the highest point through the Xiao Mountains, with upward and downward slopes of 1.5 per thousand, extending for 30 kilometers. A train overturned at Jiaokou, and 120 passengers were killed in the valley, not a single one survived, just a month ago, on that slope. Soldiers forced the train to add cars, the driver lacked experience, and the roadbed was newly built, still in the detour stage, resulting in the tragedy.</p>
<p>On this road, there is also a detour bridge 150 meters long, crossing a valley, reaching a height of 45 meters. It uses more than 10,000 pieces of wood and more than 10,000 iron bolts, all locally produced. The screw threads on the bolts are not deep, and they are easily loosened after vibration. According to the usual practice of Chinese and foreign railway engineering, detour bridges are generally about 20 meters long, and 50 meters is extremely dangerous, but this bridge reaches 150 meters and is used to officially transport passengers and goods. The train travels on it, trembling and staggering, with hearts in throats. Although the road is inspected every day, there are things that cannot be remedied by human effort. Once an accident occurs, the tragedy can be imagined. Today, in order to rush to open the railway, there are unavoidable difficulties due to the lack of materials, but it has not been heard that the transportation authorities have any guarantees. This urgently needs to be questioned by the Ministry of Transportation. The reporter observed the terrain and found that it was not impossible to change the bridge into a large embankment. Although the amount of earthwork is huge and the project is quite extensive, in the absence of readily available steel for bridge construction, while temporarily opening a detour bridge, starting construction on the large embankment would be a way to ensure safety, and its cost would definitely not be higher than using a steel bridge.</p>
<p>In the Zhengzhou area, on both sides of the Longhai Line, 100 meters from the railway, defensive trenches are being dug, running parallel to the railway, stretching endlessly. The project is also enormous, and I believe that if the earthwork of ten miles were moved here, it would be more than enough.</p>
<p>The Longhai and Pinghan lines currently have the busiest military transport, reaching almost 70 percent. Railway workers are often beaten and insulted by soldiers, even to the point of injury. The soldiers accuse the railways of being corrupt, and they call the soldiers tyrannical. In short, it shows a lack of law and order. Stationmasters along the way board the train to report incidents that have occurred or are occurring. The salaries of Longhai employees are very low, far less than those of the soldiers. But they are serving the soldiers with 70 percent of their effort, and encountering this, it is also understandable! As for the corruption of the Longhai Railway, it is almost a settled conclusion.</p>
<p>A certain military quartermaster on the train was excited to hear that military pay would be adjusted again in September. But he also did not know how much a military's monthly expenses were. Taking a division as a unit, there are Class A divisions and Class B divisions, and the brigade organization of each division is not entirely consistent. Each unit also has different treatment depending on its nature and local conditions, so it is not easy to find a standard budget figure. There are eight supply zones and seventeen officer teams nationwide. In Zhengzhou alone, there are as many as 260 military supply units. At the time of victory last year, the monthly expense of an ordinary division was 160 million in cash. It has now been adjusted three times, almost increasing tenfold. If we take 200 infantry divisions (brigades) and estimate an average of 1.5 billion per division, it would be 300 billion. Furthermore, high-level agencies, officer teams, air force, navy, and special forces are not included. As for the allocation of food, the staple food is wheat at 67 catties per unit, costing 200 yuan per catty, the required amount for 4 million people would be worth 53.6 billion. Rice in the south is twice as expensive. But this is in kind and does not require negotiating prices. Although it is stipulated that non-staple foods and other military supplies should be distributed in kind in principle, it is still difficult to do so completely in China today. The non-staple food of dried horse meat, etc., is converted into cash, which still relies on negotiating prices. Therefore, after this adjustment in military pay, the reporter estimates that at least an additional 1 trillion yuan in new banknotes will be required each month, without a doubt. This will have a decisive impact on stimulating prices.</p>
<p>Recently, prices have been soaring, just like on the westward line, the higher the terrain, the higher the prices. When we arrived in Xi'an, the price of rice reached 130,000 yuan per hundred catties, and flour was more than 500 yuan per catty. The government strictly enforced price controls, which was said to be in accordance with the Executive Yuan's implementation. How could the situation in Xi'an be so special? The result of the price controls has caused a serious food shortage in Xi'an, with flour and meat disappearing, and people fighting and bleeding for rationed flour. Today, Xi'an is probably the city with the highest food prices in the country. But 20 miles outside the city, food prices are only half of that, so the manipulation is clearly visible. This price stabilization association, jointly formed by officials and merchants, has increased the pressure of prices on the 500,000 citizens of Xi'an.</p>
<p>Red Soil and White Poplars Pass</p>
<p>The Central Plains is yellow soil, the Guanzhong region is red soil, and Chinese agricultural society grew up here. The Central Plains has become a battlefield, the people have a worried look, there are no complete houses in the fields, and it is difficult to describe the devastation. However, Guanzhong relies on the Yellow River and the Tongguan trench to ensure its integrity. The reporter once discussed the situation in Guanzhong: During the War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist army confronted the enemy with a considerable corps in central Shaanxi. The enemy did not attack Yan'an or Chang'an, did not waste troops, and did not increase the battlefield. This was the only wise move in terms of political and strategic strategy in the war of aggression against China. Today, passing Tongguan and looking back, all that can be seen is the clouds and smoke of Mount Hua, layer upon layer, concealing the high mountains, the wheat is green, and the red soil and white poplars stand tall, the mountains have more forests than the Central Plains. Therefore, the pure and steady atmosphere of Guanzhong is still no less than it was in those years. However, the people's poverty and distress have not lessened compared to the Central Plains. Many people in Chang'an wear fur coats in the market, but on the road, old women and children with ragged clothes are seen everywhere.</p>
<p>The access point to southwestern Shanxi today is only through Tongguan and Fenglingdu. Mr. Yan Xishan has his own province-based methods for Shanxi's facilities. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the situation was difficult, but he was still able to hold his own. He was praised as Yan Xishan who never retreated, and he truly deserves it. After the victory, Hu Zongnan's troops were ordered to cross Fenglingdu and enter southwestern Shanxi. The Communist army retreated, and the famous First Division advanced into Linfen. Emphasizing combat and neglecting defense, the Communist army mobilized a large force and launched a deadly siege, causing the division to suffer heavy losses. In recent months, there have been no major battles, and military forces on the north and south of the Tongpu Railway have reportedly clashed. The eastern front stops at Fushan, and Tongguan, a small place, is as crowded as it was in the early days of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>North of Tongguan, the Yili River crossing can also enter southwestern Shanxi, but transportation is inconvenient, especially after the rain, the muddy pools can block the axles. The roads around the passes are mostly like this. Cao Ruizhi, director of the Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, encountered the reporter in Xi'an due to rain blocking the road from Chongqing to Shanxi. He led a surveying team from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and planned to cross the river at Shanlongmenkou and survey the area along the way.</p>
<p>The situation in Shaanxi and Shanxi seems to be the same as in the one or two years before the War of Resistance. It is said that Yan Xishan has implemented a land distribution and integration of soldiers and farmers system, which is even more advanced than the "land village commune" of the past. The "integration of soldiers and farmers" means that farmers are organized to defend the local area. Every six people send one person to serve in the regular army, and the other five are responsible for supporting their families and cultivating the land. Some people in the area also oppose this, but it is still being implemented step by step. In politics, there is the establishment of the "Democratic Revolutionary Comrades Association," with Yan as the chairman. Today, many people in Shanxi no longer call Yan "official" but "Chairman Yan." Since the reporter has not obtained the details of all of this, it is inconvenient to make a judgment. However, driven by the situation, there are often practical reforms, taking the lead, which is most commendable. However, the current military discipline is not good, and the people of Shanxi have many complaints.</p>
<p>What the people of the country are most concerned about should be the confrontation in central Shaanxi, but since the victory, there have been major battles everywhere, except for this corner, which is silent. The outbreak of war began with the surrender, and who knows how far it will spread? However, there is nothing to report so far. There is no shortage of merchants coming and going, but they are all smuggling and trafficking privately. A train can be taken from Xianyang to Tongguan. Tongguan has coal mines. During the war, the Longhai Railway opened this Xiantong branch line to supply fuel. From Tongguan, the road is muddy and blocked after the rain, just like other roads.</p>
<p>As for what people in southern Shaanxi and western Henan are concerned about, Li Xiannian's troops are currently occupying the mountainous areas on the border of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, and have even followed the southern foothills of the Qinling Mountains and the northern bank of the Hanshui River to the Liuba area. Although the number of people is small, they have a set of methods. The mountainous areas are barren and the people are poor, and they are organizing and developing, but they have not taken a step into northern Sichuan.</p>
<p>Heavy dark clouds surround Tongguan. In the past, the Central Plains was a place of four battles, and Guanzhong had the danger of four blockades, controlling Tongguan and being in the upper reaches of the Central Plains. Shanxi was like pouring water onto Hebei. Tongguan was its throat. Today, transportation is open in all directions, but the situation of interwoven interests is no less. Good generals and strong soldiers are gathered within a thousand miles, and it is impossible to imagine the situation after peace is completely destroyed.</p>
<p>After arriving in Xi'an, the reporter crossed the Wei River Bridge, toured Lintong, climbed Mount Li, visited the Hupan Stone, explored the traces of the Xi'an Incident, and bathed in the Huaqing Pool, becoming a wealthy guest for one night. The full moon rose in the east forest, the cold light reflected on the water, the mountain wind was piercing, the trees rustled, and I patrolled the ancient city of Lintong, with only a few dim lights. The sound of the spring on the left side of the road, the smoke and clouds of a hundred generations, still remain in the night mist. Thinking about the tortuous evolution of history, there were infinite emotions.</p>

<h3>Molotov at the United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>New York Airmail, November 4th</p>
<p>He is forever the archetypal dignified old man on stage. … From the moment he disembarked from the Queen Elizabeth liner onto American docks, photographers and reporters followed him daily. Even the smallest details of his off-duty activities were revealed in the newspapers without omission.</p>
<p>In the entire United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is undoubtedly the most closely watched figure. His imposing “style” may surpass that of Metternich during the Congress of Vienna era or Clemenceau during the Versailles Conference era. Our generation did not witness Metternich or Clemenceau in their prime, but from what I imagine, I feel that Molotov is even more stubborn, profound, and overbearing than they were.</p>
<p>Molotov is weary of New York's nightlife. The Soviet delegation spent lavishly to acquire several luxurious residences in the New York countryside, close to the Flushing venue for convenience during meetings. On the opening day of the General Assembly, the Soviet delegation's cars lined up like a long snake at the entrance. Molotov led a large entourage of civil and military officials into the hall. Dozens of cameras were aimed at Molotov all at once, but he remained calm. He does not understand English or French, yet he calmly handles documents in those languages. The Soviet delegation is organized with machine-like precision. Before Molotov, Gromyko behaves like a well-behaved schoolboy. Vyshinsky occasionally speaks to him with a smile, but Molotov remains stern and dignified.</p>
<h3>For a Close-Up Shot, Mr. Molotov Performs Again</h3>
<p>On the day the Security Council and the General Assembly convened simultaneously, Molotov also attended in person. As usual, when Molotov entered the hall, a large group of Russian civil and military officials followed behind him. American representative Johnson slipped in alone through a side door. Our representative, Dr. Guo Fuchu, was already seated in a corner of the hall. (The Security Council seats rotate, and China and France happened to be in two different corners). Sir Alexander Cadogan, the quintessential British diplomat, was the chair that day. He stood up and shook hands with Molotov. A large group of photographers surged forward, and some who were a step behind asked, "Could you do it again?" Molotov seemed to be in high spirits that day, and he really did "perform" it again.</p>
<h3>Cadogan's Muffled Pronunciation Translated by Molotov's Interpreter</h3>
<p>Cadogan's muffled nasal voice filled the hall with a solemn British atmosphere. He read out the letter from the Swiss government requesting to join the "International Court of Justice" and then proposed it for discussion. Molotov did not understand English. A young, blue-eyed, blonde-haired attendant interpreter leaned over from behind and whispered a Russian translation into Molotov's ear. Molotov did not turn his head at all, his eyes looking upwards, nodding slightly. Then he considered his own ideas. He frequently raised his glass to drink water, and his two black eyes, with the hair receding in the middle, revealed a deep, sharp, and even stubborn expression.</p>
<p>Cadogan took off his glasses and held the earpiece of his glasses in his mouth like a pipe. The Mexican representative proposed referring it to a committee of experts for review, and then discussing it further. This Swiss public case was thus concluded. Cadogan loosened his buttocks and was about to announce the adjournment when the Polish scholar representative, Lange, prevented the adjournment. His fluent English, as always, was tactful and powerful, and he raised the issue of sanctions against Spain again. He said: The Security Council has discussed the Spanish issue for so long, but the issue remains unresolved. Why is it not included in today's "agenda"? After Lange finished speaking, as always, he turned to the people next to him with a smile, but the result was also the same as always, no one responded with a smile.</p>
<h3>Mr. Molotov Speaks in Russian, Cadogan Shows Difficulty</h3>
<p>Molotov spoke in Russian. He agreed to immediately discuss the issue of sanctions against Spain. After the young translator rendered it into English, Cadogan looked very embarrassed. Finally, the representatives of Egypt and the Netherlands mediated and decided to postpone the discussion for three days. Cadogan asked Molotov, and Molotov said nothing, only nodded a few times. Lange again used beautiful English to say that the Egyptian representative's meaning was: "Reasonable and acceptable."</p>
<p>At the adjournment, Molotov was the first to rush out of the hall, with the Slavic civil and military officials following closely behind. That day, Molotov's short few words made "headline" news again in the New York evening papers.</p>
<h3>Two Young Interpreters, Excellent in English and Shorthand</h3>
<p>The New York Times and the Herald Tribune published the full text of Molotov's speech blasting England and the United States, and also published many photos of his speaking posture. That speech was delivered at the General Assembly, spoken in Russian and then translated into English. Molotov brought two very capable interpreters who not only needed to be good at both English and Russian, but also needed to understand very proficient shorthand. These two young Russians were in no way inferior to the General Assembly's full-time interpreters.</p>
<p>Russians mostly speak solemnly, with stiff postures but not lacking in emotional power. Molotov is the same, his hands always moving up and down, and moving in the same way. When he speaks Russian, the audience, because they do not understand the content, only looks at his expression and posture. After it is translated into English, the seats of the British and American delegations are immediately filled with tension.</p>
<p>British Deputy Chief Sir Alexander Cadogan sat at the foot of the podium. After each representative of a major country (and also small countries) finished speaking and stepped down from the podium, he would definitely bend over and shake hands warmly. There was only one exception, and that was when Molotov stepped down from the podium.</p>
<h3>The Most Subtle One-Fiftieth of a Second Shot - Unfortunately, the Photographer Did Not Capture It</h3>
<p>The opposite situation was: Molotov walked past Mrs. Roosevelt's seat, wanting to reach out and shake hands with Mrs. Roosevelt, but the American women leader did not move, nor did she say a word of compliment about the success of his speech. That moment was subtle, at most "one-fiftieth" of a second, and the photographer did not capture it.</p>
<p>The New York Daily Mirror reporter, Edward, sitting next to me, said: Although Mrs. Roosevelt is seen as "left-leaning," she is, after all, a devout patriot. He also said: A patriotic American cannot tolerate such a public insult to the United States. Edward saw that "one-fiftieth of a second" shot very clearly.</p>
<h3>Mr. Molotov Rarely Applauds, Except for Truman</h3>
<p>Diplomatic occasions must be evenly matched. When the US Chief Representative Austin responded to the Soviet speech, there was a burst of warm applause from the audience, but Molotov did not move. Molotov rarely applauded for others. He applauded when President Truman delivered his speech. When Indian representative Pandit spoke about countries withdrawing troops from the territories of non-enemy states, the Russian delegation applauded enthusiastically, but Molotov was not there that day.</p>
<h3>The American Public's Impression of Mr. Molotov is Extremely Deepened</h3>
<p>But whether viewed positively or negatively, Molotov's impression on American society is extremely profound. Since he disembarked from the Queen Elizabeth liner onto American docks, almost every day, New York newspapers have published Molotov's speeches, actions, and photos. Photographers and special reporters follow him daily, and even the smallest details of his off-duty activities are revealed in the newspapers without omission. I remember that during the first United Nations General Assembly in London this January, Vyshinsky also became the object of British reporters' attention for a while. Vyshinsky told those reporters: "Please don't keep focusing on me for news, go find my daughter, she is a beautiful girl who can talk and socialize!" That Miss Vyshinsky later made many absurd remarks, such as: "Why is the clock in Westminster Abbey so old?" For example: "I like to see the white horse of the Royal Guard in front of Buckingham Palace," which became good material for the supplements and "bits and pieces" or "tidbits" in London newspapers.</p>
<h3>Besides Quoting Lenin, He is Not Accustomed to Citing Classics</h3>
<p>Molotov did not bring such a son or daughter to America. He is forever the archetypal dignified old man on stage. In Vyshinsky's speeches, he often liked to mention Turgenev, Tolstoy, Gorky, etc., and even "bragged" about Russian music one day in a subcommittee (Russian music has always been considered very important in Western society). Just like Chinese Dr. Xia Jinlin, who often uses fluent English to talk about Confucius's philosophy, this can originally reconcile the atmosphere of the meeting. But Molotov never does that. He sometimes quotes classics, but only from Lenin or Stalin, and even Lenin is rarely quoted.</p>
<p>On the weekend of the first week of the meeting, I watched a movie in a theater. In the newsreel, Molotov appeared again. In the left corner of the theater, there were seven or eight voices applauding, followed by a large chorus of "boo" sounds. Is this a small public opinion poll? Molotov himself must understand it better than we do.</p>

<h3>A Perspective on Xinjiang (3)</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by Our Editorial Office</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The position of Zhang Zhizhong, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, can be considered the most difficult position in all of Asia. If Zhang can make the four million Muslims in that vast region loyal to the National Government, he will surely establish a great miracle in political history.</p>
<p>Zhang is now undertaking this arduous task, facing various obstacles, the biggest of which is the legacy left by his predecessor, Sheng Shicai. What Sheng Shicai's ten years of tyrannical rule left in the hearts of the Xinjiang Muslims was nothing but a deep-seated hatred for the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>As a result of the successful Yining Incident, an autonomous Muslim government was established in the northwestern part of Xinjiang, which accounts for one-third of the province's most fertile area. The rebels signed a treaty in Dihua on June 6 this year, agreeing that the three rebellious areas in the northwest should be part of Xinjiang Province and be governed by the joint Chinese-Muslim government. However, from all aspects of my observation, I cannot prove that the so-called "East Turkestan People's Republic" has the sincerity to fulfill the Dihua Treaty.</p>
<p>Currently, the military power of the Chinese government in Xinjiang is bounded by the Manas River, which is 70 miles west of Dihua. Outside this boundary, no Central Government troops or officials are allowed to cross the line. As a result, the Xinjiang government in Dihua cannot obtain the much-needed coal, oil, gold, grains, flour, meat, and leather from the resource-rich northwest, while the rebels are doing good business with the Soviet Union across the Kazakhstan border. In fact, a large number of Soviet goods are freely smuggled to Dihua via Yining, and the Muslims in Yining even prohibit Chairman Zhang from obtaining gasoline from the rich Usu oil field 150 miles west of Dihua. In Dihua, the price of gasoline per gallon is three US dollars.</p>
<p>The Yining rebels have a well-organized army, with a strength of at least 11,000 people, totaling six regiments, half cavalry and half infantry.</p>
<p>I have spoken with several Uyghur leaders loyal to Zhang, and they are all worried about Zhang. Unless Sheng Shicai is brought to justice, it will be difficult for Zhang to regain the hearts of the people. In fact, the Muslims have filed a lawsuit with the Xinjiang Provincial Assembly accusing Sheng of mistreating the people, confiscating people's property, and imprisoning good people, requesting a legal trial. The Central Government still retains administrative control in the vast desert area south of the Tianshan Mountains, but the Uyghurs also do not have a good impression of the Chinese government because they resent Sheng Shicai.</p>

<h3>The Trade Scramble between England, America and Soviet Union the Outline of the Three Trade Worlds Are Gradually Emerging</h3>
<p>— Translated from "World Report" Weekly by Nan</p>
<p>Translated from World Report Weekly by Our Editorial Office</p>
<p>The specter of war is gradually disappearing, and the outlines of the three trade worlds are gradually emerging.</p>
<p>One trade world is forming under the leadership of the United States: The United States is the largest exporter, and is currently providing tens of billions of loans to other countries, hoping to export even more as a result. Another trade world is centered on England: England is the largest importer, and is now stepping up exports, hoping to import even more as a result. The Soviet Union is forming the third trade world: The Soviet Union is the most self-sufficient country on Earth, and is now obviously trying to become even more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>What is dangerous is that the boundaries of these three trade worlds may harden and become barriers, and the result may not only fail to achieve trade but also harm peace.</p>
<p>The surge in exports from England and the United States temporarily conceals the fact that the world is divided into three trade spheres of influence. The value of US commercial exports has reached a 26-year high, and the highest record of 1920 is already in sight. England's exports are more than 50% higher than expected, and 15% higher than in 1938.</p>
<p>But the sharp wording in the Paris Conference has already revealed the fear and future difficulties hidden behind the increase in export figures. US Secretary of State Byrnes has publicly accused the Soviet Union of trying to force small countries to join its own trade world, not allowing outside interference. He compared the Soviet Union's actions to those of Germany in the Hitler era, calling it economic slavery and exploitation. Byrnes said: The United States advocates the establishment of an economic world in which there are no treaties or conspiracies that can restrict trade and distort international economic relations.</p>
<h3>World Trade Divided into Three</h3>
<p>But what Byrnes opposes already exists in fact. In terms of trade, what exists today is not one world but rather three quite distinct worlds. In addition to geographical conditions, different trade policies and implementation methods divide world trade into three.</p>
<p>Moscow is the hub of a trade world, which includes not only pre-war Soviet Union but also other countries such as Finland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania. The strength of the Soviet army, supplemented by the political activities of communist groups, has dragged these lands into the Soviet world.</p>
<p>Due to the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction work, it is urgently necessary to conduct trade with the outside world, but the conditions for this trade always follow the methods prescribed by Moscow. There are very few opportunities for private commerce, and all transactions are handled by government agencies. At the same time, Soviet politics influences many transactions, changing the nature of trade.</p>
<p>In fact, the trade controlled by Moscow is still relatively small in quantity, accounting for only about 7% of the world's total exports and imports according to pre-war figures.</p>
<p>But the actual importance is much greater. Moscow's success in trade will increase the Soviet Union's self-sufficiency, which will accelerate its political isolation. If Europe is isolated from the eastern agricultural areas, the chances of recovery will be even less than they are now. The entire economic world advocated by the United States will also be shattered.</p>
<h3>US Trade Scope Unclear</h3>
<p>Washington is the hub of another trade world, whose scope, methods, and purposes are almost completely different from the trade world centered on Moscow. The scope of US trade is vague. Generally speaking, it includes most of Central and South America, with Argentina as an exception. The Philippines are clearly included, and perhaps China is also included. As for whether the United States can bring European countries that accept its loans into its scope, it is still uncertain.</p>
<p>What connects this world is the common acceptance of the United States' leadership in economic affairs, at least verbally agreeing with the United States' goal of freely expanding world trade. Different trade policies and methods are considered temporary products of wartime.</p>
<p>The scope of US trade represents the ideal of free trade. In normal times, one-fifth of international commodity trade circulates within this region. The United States itself accounts for 15% of the world's commodity exports and 10% of commodity imports. The improvement or deterioration of the US economic situation is closely related to the whole world.</p>
<h3>London is Between the Soviet Union and the United States</h3>
<p>London stands in the middle of Washington and Moscow, both in terms of trade and geography. The trade world centered on London is willing to support the United States' world trade policy, but has not yet abandoned the wartime measures against free trade. When signing the Anglo-American loan, England guaranteed that the sterling area, preferential treatment within the British Empire, and bilateral agreements restricting trade competition would all be eliminated. As for when to eliminate them, it must be decided by England after considering the actual situation.</p>
<p>The composition of England's world trade is clearer than that of the United States, and includes the entire United Kingdom. Before the end of the war, the bilateral currency and trade agreements signed by England and Western European countries expanded the scope by a lot. Before the war, the British Empire accounted for one-third of the world's imports and more than one-quarter of the world's exports. If London's power can absorb many European countries through many bilateral agreements, then England can represent half of the world's trade.</p>
<p>The struggle between England, the Soviet Union, and the United States in trade concepts and methods has now gone beyond their own scope and touched on several countries that occupy strategic positions. The trade struggle is evolving into an ideological struggle.</p>

<h3>Trieste Port</h3>
<p>— Zuoqi</p>
<p>At the recent meeting of the four foreign ministers in New York, there is still no sign of a solution to the long-standing unresolved issue of the Port of Trieste.</p>
<p>The Port of Trieste (Trieste) is located on the Istrian Peninsula, on the northernmost end of the Adriatic Sea. This place is a strategic point for Central Europe to reach the sea, and its position is important. Therefore, both Italy and Yugoslavia attach great importance to it, and compete for territorial sovereignty. The Soviet Union wants to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean, and England and the United States want to prevent its influence from intruding, so they do not hesitate to act as backstage supporters, and often argue endlessly in many international conferences, which increases the complexity of the Trieste Port issue.</p>
<p>Before the First World War, the Port of Trieste was the only important port for Austria to reach the Mediterranean. After the war, it was ceded to Italy according to the Treaty of Versailles. Now, after the Second World War, the sovereignty of the Port of Trieste is still undecided.</p>
<p>The Port of Trieste is industrially prosperous, with shipbuilding, oil refining, and machinery being its main industries. Commerce is also thriving. Exports mainly include grape wine, oil, tobacco, wool, etc.</p>

<h3>The Misguided Path of British Diplomacy: Economic Panic Has Cast a Shadow</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu-kun</p>
<p>In the post-war world, both politically and economically, vulnerabilities are exposed everywhere. In order to restore the freedom of international trade, the United States convened an international trade and employment conference in London to discuss reducing tariff barriers. At the same time, it took the lead in conducting business negotiations with eighteen countries in the world, hoping to jointly reduce tariffs with various countries. However, the future of American export trade is still difficult to maintain at past levels. In Britain, too, the shadow of global economic panic has been cast upon the world, and to prevent this shadow from moving to Britain, it has begun to implement austerity measures. The reporting of these news makes everyone have to worry about the future of the world economy!</p>
<p>In this week, the issues discussed by the United Nations General Assembly, in addition to the demands of some small countries to amend the United Nations Charter due to dissatisfaction with the permanent members of the Security Council exercising the "veto power", there was also the issue of the trusteeship of a colony, which also took a long time for the United Nations General Assembly to discuss without achieving any results.</p>
<p>Small Countries Advocate Amending the Charter</p>
<p>The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met on the 14th of this month. Representatives of several small countries, especially Australia, Cuba, the Philippines, Argentina and other countries, delivered speeches one after another, unanimously criticizing the "veto power" and believing that the existence of the "veto power" is a manifestation of "dictatorship by powerful countries", which should not be allowed to exist in this era of peace and democracy. Therefore, they unanimously demanded the amendment of the United Nations Charter; but on the other hand, the five permanent members, especially the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union, firmly opposed amending the United Nations Charter and advocated submitting this issue to the Five Powers Conference for resolution. At that time, the major powers and small countries held their own views, almost bringing the General Assembly to the brink of collapse. Fortunately, the representatives of China and France, with a moderate attitude, put forward a compromise plan, advocating that the five powers should exercise their veto power only on important issues, and the atmosphere of the United Nations General Assembly began to ease slightly. In addition, the United Kingdom proposed to submit this issue to the Five Powers Conference for discussion, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also expressed his agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, British Foreign Secretary Bevin also put forward a suggestion, advocating four points: (1) The five powers should exercise their veto power only on cases that are closely related to their own interests; (2) Abstaining from voting should not be regarded as exercising veto power; (3) Efforts should be made to reduce the opportunities for the five powers to exercise their veto power; (4) Clear explanations should be given for various disputes. The US representative has expressed agreement, and there will be no problem with China and France.</p>
<p>Progress Has Been Made on the Trieste Issue</p>
<p>This time, the four foreign ministers held a meeting in New York to review the drafts of various peace treaties passed by the Paris Peace Conference, which were originally only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. US Secretary of State Byrnes also stated that if this meeting of foreign ministers still ended in discord, the United States would no longer participate in any international conferences in the future. However, when the four foreign ministers discussed the draft peace treaty with Italy, the most thorny issues of the border between Italy and Yugoslavia and the port of Trieste encountered another reef. The focus of the so-called Trieste port issue lies in the powers of the administrative governor. The Soviet Union advocated that the powers of the administrative governor over the police should be restricted, but the United Kingdom and the United States believed that they should not be restricted, otherwise it would be impossible to maintain law and order. After the reconciliation and compromise of French Foreign Minister Bidault, a compromise was finally reached. However, Molotov still wanted to clearly define the "state of emergency", and this minor issue has now been submitted to the four undersecretaries for discussion, and it is of course not difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Labor Party Members Dissatisfied with Diplomacy</p>
<p>After the Labor Party came to power, the second Parliament opened on the 12th of this month. The King delivered a speech, and Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech, reporting on domestic and foreign affairs. Although opposition leaders such as Churchill and Eden also routinely attacked the government's failures in domestic and foreign affairs, it is not worth paying much attention to. However, forty-one Labor Party members suddenly jointly submitted a motion, opposing the current diplomatic policy adopted by the Labor Party government, and advocating the adoption of a policy that opposes both American capitalism and Soviet communism. The news came out, shocking the world. It can not only see the cracks within the Labor Party, but also makes it very obvious that British foreign policy is at a crossroads.</p>
<p>After this motion is put forward, the House of Commons will inevitably discuss it, but Foreign Secretary Bevin is far away in New York, attending the meeting of four foreign ministers. Although the Prime Minister telegraphed him to return to the country to defend his diplomatic policy, the meeting of foreign ministers is of great importance and he cannot be spared, so he cannot return to the country and can only ask the Prime Minister to represent him. When the time comes, the Prime Minister Attlee's situation will be embarrassing, which is also self-evident. It is reported that Prime Minister Attlee will propose a vote of confidence. If so, the split within the British Labor Party may be inevitable.</p>
<p>The post-war world is disintegrating, making it really difficult for countries to cope. American diplomats have long felt depressed, and now British diplomats are also hesitating and worrying there. Where to go from here? It really requires the Labor Party authorities to carefully consider and then make a wise choice!</p>
<h3>Symphony of Peace</h3>
<p>The contemporary great composer Honegger's "Prayer Symphony" was premiered in France last week with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which can be called a major event in the music world. This piece was completed in 1945 and was only played once in Zurich, Switzerland a few months ago. This time, it was played by the French Orchestra in the theater on the Avenue of the President, and the celebrities of the Paris music world warmly welcomed it. The song includes three movements, using music to describe the drama of the modern world, the sorrows of mankind, and the restoration of peace. At this concert, two other contemporary masterpieces were also premiered, namely Roberts' "Fifth Symphony" and Prokofiev's "Four Portraits".</p>
<h3>The Lucky One Within the Soviet Sphere: Finland Enjoys More Freedom</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Finnish Authorities Pay the Price for Democracy</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Finland feels that the Soviet Union is treating this Nordic neighbor with gentle means, because compared with most countries in Eastern Europe, Finland currently enjoys more freedom.</p>
<p>This country has not been occupied by Soviet troops. The behavior of some Red Army soldiers and sailors attached to the control committee (located in Helsinki) is impeccable.</p>
<p>Although Finland was defeated in the Second World War and German troops were stationed on its territory for three years, and has been at the mercy of the Soviet Union since the armistice agreement with the Soviet Union in September 1944, the Finnish people are still free people, and are still democratic in their interests and actions, but they also pay a considerable price.</p>
<p>They endure pain with more tenacity than any other defeated country, but this pain is extremely serious.</p>
<p>There is not much food in Finland. The rations of meat, sugar and fat are far from what is needed to maintain health. Wheat bread is almost impossible to obtain, and the ration of rye bread is only barely enough. Although the rationing of fish and eggs has been abolished this summer, the price is too expensive for most families. Luxury goods are not available at all, and even tea, cocoa and coffee are included.</p>
<p>Although this situation has continued for two years, there are very few cases of poor health, there are no epidemic diseases, the infant mortality rate does not increase, and children do not have serious diseases or signs of malnutrition, at least not very severely.</p>
<p>Finland, like many other European countries, also has a black market, but its impact on the lives of ordinary Finns is relatively small. First, because very few people can afford to buy goods from the black market at extremely high prices; second, because it is not as easy to buy as in other European countries.</p>
<p>The extreme shortage of clothing and housing is another major problem for Finns. Leather shoes and wool fabrics are simply not available, and substitutes are very few and of poor quality. What Finns have the most is paper. At present, paper plays an important role in the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Severe Shortages of Materials and Housing</p>
<p>Among the most popular paper "items" are: curtains, tablecloths, sheets, aprons, stiff collars, shoes and many other things.</p>
<p>Housing is also extremely scarce, so it is necessary to implement a one-room-per-person system, especially strictly in cities.</p>
<p>According to the armistice agreement, Finns lost Petsamo and the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean; they lost the Porkkala Peninsula near Helsinki (leased to the Soviet Union for fifty years as a naval base) and the direct railway connecting Helsinki and Turku, the two major cities; they lost the province of Karelia, including the city of Vyborg, the Saimaa industrial area, and the agricultural area that produces one-eighth of the country's meat and grain.</p>
<p>The provisions on reparations in the armistice agreement are particularly harsh. The Finns must pay the Soviet Union US$300 million by September 1952. Payment must be made in goods specified by the Soviet Union, and the 1938 level must be used as the basis for calculation, although the prices of several goods have increased by 10% or 15%.</p>
<p>Finns are not restricted by the Soviet Union in terms of propaganda, and they still run newspapers or organize political groups in their own way, the only condition is that they do not criticize the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>They still have the freedom to elect a parliament, but they are only prevented from admitting people who have had close relations with the Germans into the parliament. The current government is not one that the parliament likes to support, but is reluctantly elected to please the Soviet Union, but this government is at least not appointed by the Soviet Union. Moscow has issued them orders to imprison war leaders, purge the police, etc., but these orders have not gone too far.</p>
<p>Finns have a traditional fear of the Soviet Union, but it does not affect their tenacious attitude.</p>

<h3>After Listening to Gao Zhilan's Solo Recital: Talking About Chinese Female Musicians</h3>
<p>— Liang Youting</p>
<p>Listening to Miss Gao Zhilan's solo recital reminded me of the following:</p>
<p>Many articles discuss "women and music", and most of them cite many examples to prove that although women's personalities are closer to music art than men's, there are few female musicians in history. The nicknames of "King of Piano" (Liszt), violin virtuoso (Paganini), and even "Female Beethoven" (Schubert) are all male. In singing and opera, many women are clearly needed, but the "champion" is always unrelated to women. If there are any, they are just rare exceptions. The reason for this: I think it is not that women's musical talent is inferior to men's. God has no reason to particularly favor men; it is only because men can devote themselves to music, devote their lives to music, and even like Beethoven, never marry, "live for music, die for music", and even if men get married, it has little impact on their artistic life in music. But it is not the case for women. After marriage, the pursuit of art is sacrificed for the husband and children. Just like our professional youths, the pursuit of art is sacrificed for the sake of making a living. Lang Yuxiu's "coloratura soprano" is completely different before and after marriage. A few days ago, many people had heard her solo recital in the Zhen Dan Auditorium or the Hongkou Cultural Hall. It cannot be denied that her volume and range have been reduced to the minimum limit, and her tone has been so weak and powerless. Now, although she still wants to go to the United States for further study, it is difficult to be sure whether this mother of several children can restore her beautiful tone and bright volume before marriage. Also, the female pianist Pan Meibo was once as famous as Dong Guang, but now she is no longer seen on the stage showing her nimble and skillful ten fingers; she is now Mrs. Chen Jianhua, and family affairs have inevitably worn away her artistic efforts, and physiological changes have inevitably damaged her many talents. Although it cannot be said that marriage has absolutely destroyed her artistic achievements, the impression she gives us of going downhill cannot be said to be unrelated to family. Like Dai Ailian, a female dancer, although married to the cartoonist Ye Qianyu, a couple of artists, life is a joy, and both are currently in good shape, but how many years can it last?</p>
<p>Few exceptions: the soprano Mrs. Guan (Guan Yixuan) has not been adversely affected by marriage. During the Anti-Japanese War, she was very popular in the rear, no, not "popular", but indeed admired and praised for her excellent skills. She sang in Beijing and Shanghai after the victory. The volume, the tone, the expression, and the wide range (that is, being able to sing very high notes and still handle them with ease) are really fascinating and admirable. I (and many people) think she should be the top female singer in China.</p>
<p>However, in any case, women studying music and getting married are like bear paws and fish. I am not a shout for singleness, but this is a fact. To achieve a very high achievement in music (especially vocal music), if you are a woman, it is best to choose one between music and husband and stay with it forever. Only a few exceptions can have the best of both worlds. The famous Chinese female violin virtuoso Fei Man'er was married to an air combatant. Before the marriage, her mother strongly opposed it, fearing that marriage would hinder her musical career; during the Anti-Japanese War, her husband died in India, which made her heart covered with infinite pain and suffering in the situation of "gain and loss", although it increased her artistic emotion, it was ultimately not conducive to regular learning. Not long ago, I heard that she was going to the United States (or has already gone). If she can completely entrust her lonely life to the four strings of the violin in the future, perhaps her achievements will be more than if her husband had not died.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find female musicians in history, but there are quite a few female musicians in Shanghai; in addition to the above-mentioned ones, there are also Chen Liqing (a very good soprano), Qian Yishan (a cellist), etc., who all have unlimited prospects. And Miss Gao Zhilan, a coloratura soprano who is about to go to the United States recently (at the invitation of the National Music and Art Company of the United States), is also a female singer in the golden age. She is a student of Su Shilin (Italian), a famous vocal music professor in Shanghai. A famous teacher has a good student, which is highly praised. Mr. Su Shilin praised her very much. At the press conference last time, Su Shilin specially introduced her, saying that Miss Gao is the only Chinese soprano who has been hired by the American Music and Art Company. I can say that her farewell solo recital, which I listened to carefully, was generally successful. This soprano once played the lead role in operas in Shanghai before the victory. The Shanghai music scene is very familiar with her. She is often invited to the summer performances of the Municipal Orchestra. I think in terms of singing experience, she is not as experienced as Lang Yuxiu, but the "power" she expresses in her songs is far better than Miss Lang and second only to Mrs. Guan. This farewell solo recital was more progressive than her previous performances.</p>
<p>However, when singing later, perhaps due to vocal fatigue, the highest notes had some "raspy" feeling. This is not the case with Mrs. Guan. When she sang the entire wonderful program at the end, almost every song was requested by the audience to be repeated once, or even twice, but she showed no signs of being unable to cope. I think Miss Gao Zhilan will not let Mrs. Guan monopolize the beauty in the future after working hard for a certain period of time. However, because we have seen many musicians (especially vocal musicians) being adversely affected by marriage, I think if Miss Gao can marry herself to music, her future achievements will be extremely amazing, and will far surpass Lang Yuxiu and the others. This is one point; another point is that it seems that musicians are now withdrawing from Shanghai one after another and going to the United States unanimously. Do not "forget your motherland because of happiness", the barren Chinese music scene still needs your talents very much! Pretending to be an expert, I wrote a random article, I don't know if it is right or not?</p>

<h3>Red Leaves</h3>
<p>— Xuan Jianren</p>
<p>—Autumn Day Submission</p>
<p>I love the maple forest in autumn. But red leaves evoke my boundless thoughts, because you picked this red leaf and pinned it on my chest, like a glorious medal.</p>
<p>"Beautiful, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Extremely beautiful!"</p>
<p>It is said that "seeing things evokes feelings". Life is a distance of many blanks, as if a playwright is playing with life, and insists on writing "reunion" as the result of a tragedy. I am now playing a tragic role on the social stage. I still don't know when it will end.</p>
<p>Why can't I "create" the world and find another way? What binds me is emotion; I don't have the courage to cut it off, let it make me grope on the journey of life.</p>
<p>When will I grope to the road of happiness?</p>
<p>On gloomy days, I weave the picked red leaves into poems and recite them to the boundless wilderness, so that they can resonate in your heart.</p>
<p>"I hope to write my name on the blank of my heart!"</p>
<p>Your charming smile opened the door of my melancholy, and the sun illuminated my heart.</p>
<p>"Don't write poems anymore!"</p>
<p>The water of the Jialing River converges into the Yangtze River, and the waves beat tightly on the boat. We are floating like ascending to immortality. I am silent, wanting to include our lives in one sentence. I think again and again: Oh, why bother to seriously guess the mystery of life.</p>
<p>No one can take away "love", unless like Newton seeing the apple falling to the ground, he is surprised by the truth of nature, and I am still waiting for the ripe fruit.</p>
<p>I returned to my "unfamiliar" hometown, because I was not born in this ancient city. This is my second time back to my hometown.</p>
<p>The pace of autumn has stepped to the gate of winter, and the red leaves will slowly wither and corrode. I remember Shelley's line:</p>
<p>"If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?"</p>
<p>I have welcomed hope towards spring, and I can have an answer in spring.</p>

<h3>The Crystallization of Pain</h3>
<p>— Ma Chaoying</p>
<p>When we finish watching a work of art, if we want to study this work more deeply, we may first study the inner emotions of the artist when writing this work, then we can get a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the works of artists have mostly been written in times of extreme grief and pain, because the world often gives many great artists extremely bad fates and encounters, making them struggle in poverty, hunger, loss of love and suffering; as a result of their struggle, their art is achieved.</p>
<p>A Chinese scholar said: "All great articles since ancient times are written in blood and tears." Indeed, Beethoven's "Symphony", Gissing's "The Poor Street", Storm's "Immensee", Morillo's "The Life of a Beggar", and Ropshin's "The Gray Horse" are all written after suffering. These great and immortal works of theirs are exchanged for blood and tears. They have tasted all the cruelty and sorrow of the world, but their art is as radiant as the sun and the moon. Their works are passed down to future generations, and when people read or hear them, they will feel the same way, which is what achieves their "Effect of Art".</p>
<p>Therefore, when we see a brilliant work of art, we should not only feel that this work is full of beauty and light, we must know that this is the crystallization of pain, this is the brilliance obtained in the darkness, it is immortal.</p>
<h3>The Writing Location of the *Pipa Ji*</h3>
<p>— Tian Xing</p>
<p>A few months ago, I heard that the *Pipa Ji* was performed in America and received quite favorable reviews. Recently, I saw an advertisement in the newspaper saying that the *Pipa Ji* has been adapted into a spoken drama by Tian Han.</p>
<p>The book *Pipa Ji* is known as the ancestor of Southern Drama. Together with the *Romance of the Western Chamber* of Northern Drama, it is one of the two major pillars of Northern and Southern Drama. The story of Cai Bojie and Zhao Wuniang was already popular in the Song Dynasty. At that time, the poet Lu Fangweng had a line: "Who cares about right and wrong after death? I hear people singing about Cai Zhonglang along the street." Gao Zecheng expanded the meaning of this story and wrote the *Pipa Ji* libretto.</p>
<p>Gao Zecheng, originally named Ming, was from Ruian, Zhejiang, during the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. He once served as a county official in Chuzhou and had a good reputation in politics. Later, to avoid the chaos of Fang Guozhen, he abandoned his official position and lived in seclusion in Lishi Town, Ningbo. The book *Pipa Ji* was written in this place. Our *Yinxian Zhi* (Gazetteer of Yin County) has such a record.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I made a special trip to Lishi Town. It is a small village about ten miles from Ningbo city. Ningbo Airport is now located in this area. The village used to be quite prosperous, but a major fire a few years ago destroyed more than half of the houses, so it has a rather declining appearance. Most of the residents here are farmers, and many women can weave mats. It is estimated that there are about one hundred households in the village. The folk customs are simple and honest, without gambling or other bad habits.</p>
<p>According to the elders, Gao Zecheng lived in a small building in a place called Shiqiangtou (Stone Wall Head). It is said that this building still existed in the early years of the Republic of China, but it was later destroyed by a fire. An old man once took me to see the ruins, which are now a vegetable garden belonging to the Liu family. He also told me many anecdotes about Gao Zecheng, saying that when Gao was writing *Pipa Ji*, he kept many fierce dogs to guard the door, fearing that guests would disturb his mind. However, Gao suffered greatly in his later years. His wife died, and he had no sons. He lived in a temple near the village, relying on a monk for a living. Eventually, he died in this place. He was buried next to a small river behind the village, without a tombstone, only a pile of dirt, leaving no trace. Unexpectedly, a writer of a generation ended up like this!</p>
<p>In this village, it is a tradition that every "Dengtou" (Lantern Festival, the fifteenth night of the first month), a troupe is hired to perform, and the entire *Pipa Ji* must be performed. However, in recent years, it has been difficult to find Kunqu opera performers, so Yue opera has been used as a substitute.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Gao Zecheng's original hometown was Ruian, Zhejiang. I wonder what records are in the *Ruian Xian Zhi* (Gazetteer of Ruian County)? Our *Yinxian Zhi* (Gazetteer of Yin County) only says that he hid in Lishi, Ningbo, to avoid the Fang Guozhen rebellion and wrote *Pipa Ji*. Apart from this brief historical passage, there are no other records.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a poem written by Gao Zecheng in the *Siming Suoji* (Miscellaneous Records of Siming) by Liu Yifeng, a scholar in the early Qing Dynasty, about lying ill in a monk's room. I have copied it out as the ending of this article.</p>
<p>"The white sun and yellow clouds herald dusk.</p>
<p>Little is left of these remaining years,</p>
<p>Illness is like snow on the eaves, hard to melt,</p>
<p>Sorrow is like ice on the pond, growing stronger.</p>
<p>Cutting off love exhausts my strength, but it enters my dreams,</p>
<p>Refining poetry opens my mind and leads to Chan;</p>
<p>The old monk has Zhongshan brew,</p>
<p>I beg for a deep cup to cure my sleeplessness."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 98</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Under the "loyalty" test, most of the questions are of this type. It leaves you at a loss for how to answer. If you answer very beautifully: "The first principle of the Black Dragon Society is 'To sacrifice everything for the motherland,' so carrying out the orders of the committee is to protect the motherland." Such an answer will surely lead to even more difficult questions; the reason for the difficulty in answering is that if you answer correctly according to reason, what you answer will inevitably conflict with your previous answer. If you don't consider the previous and the following and answer according to reason, these executive committee members will surely think that your "thinking is inverted and illogical," and then you will not be able to receive the second-level "intelligence" test.</p>
<p>So, what is the most logical answer? You should say, "Executing orders is the obligation of a member. After executing orders, I will be subject to the judgment of national law and will never escape punishment." Such an answer is considered "logical."</p>
<p>However, if you answer this way, they will definitely ask you, "Punishment is very painful. Are you not afraid of pain?" Your answer, of course, is "I am not afraid of pain." Very good. Then prepare to suffer. They have many scientific forms of torture here; the terrifying types are all imitations of the various arrangements of sound, light, chemicals, and electricity used by Western detectives to interrogate and startle criminals. You have to try one or two of them personally. Or, like the cruel type, like the inhuman torture chambers of medieval Europe, such as fire burning, hanging, hammering, bone locking, tendon piercing, etc., you have to endure them a little. Of course, in order to keep you, a "useful person," they will let you taste a little and stop there, so as not to break your bones, but it is still enough for you to suffer. It is said that some members have suffered the disaster of three days in a water prison, and some have suffered seven days of starvation in a dungeon. That depends on the degree of trust the committee members have in you and their mood.</p>
<p>Or, if the committee thinks that your first-level answer is "illogical" and cannot continue the second-level test, then at most you will not be able to join the society, right? That is not possible. Why? Because you came to participate in this Black Dragon Society, whether voluntarily or forced, as long as you enter this secret society, you have already become a member. They believe that since you have come to be tested, you have stepped over the threshold, and since you have stepped over the threshold, you have learned about the secrets of their society, so you must become a member. It's just a kind of "probationary member." The so-called probationary member has a share in all the thankless tasks. When doing these thankless tasks, at least two or more senior members will be watching. If you do well, there is no reward; if you do poorly, the punishment is very harsh. If you want to "reveal the sincerity," then you can just give up your life. The so-called "revealing sincerity" means "jumping ship," or "defecting," or betraying the party, then your crime will surely be unforgivable!</p>
<p>The method for this type of initial test failure in the society is "on-the-spot testing," so there are also ways to accumulate merit in on-the-spot testing and be exempt from the first and second-level tests. Unfortunately, there are even those who spend their entire lives in on-the-spot testing.</p>
<p>In addition to the "loyalty" and "intelligence" tests, there are also "trust," "steadfastness," and "endurance," for a total of "five-level tests." After successfully completing the five levels, during the three-month initial new member period, like Wang Lun of Liangshan Marsh speaking to Lin Chong, you have to present a "certificate of allegiance." This is partly because they are imitating the method of controlling the younger brothers by the king of bandits; on the one hand, it is imitating the rules of European and American secret criminal gangs; members who join the party must first commit a murder, and the party leader will hold this criminal evidence to control you. If you do not listen to the transfer or betray the party, he will send this criminal evidence to the police station and reveal your crime.</p>

<h3>Abacus</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>A taxi driver said to me:</p>
<p>"Friends who buy cars are too stupid. Instead of buying a car, it's better to hire a taxi."</p>
<p>I thought he was advertising, soliciting business for taxis. I asked him, "How do you say that?" He said:</p>
<p>"Sir, can you use an abacus? Suppose you spend ten million yuan to buy a car, at a monthly interest rate of two cents, that's two million yuan per month. May I ask if you need to spend seventy thousand yuan per day hiring a taxi? Moreover, if you have a car, there are the driver's salary, maintenance fees, repair fees, gasoline fees, and many other troubles..."</p>
<p>The reasoning is indeed correct.</p>
<p>Topping a house is also the same situation. Topping a building with four gold bars, two or three rooms, isn't that equivalent to paying two million yuan in rent per month? But in order to acquire property and buy a house, there are currently very few such wealthy friends in Shanghai.</p>
<p>All of this is due to high interest rates, which in the end reverses the principles of economics, making real value surpass everything, and banknotes keep flowing. All those who acquire property become fools.</p>
<h3>Ordinary People Are Not Good</h3>
<p>— Wu Jun</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on Current Affairs</p>
<p>In this day and age, it is best to be a dumb Chinese person. If you are told to demolish the road, you obediently demolish the road. If you are told to repair the road, you obediently repair the road. Don't make a sound, because even a few words can cause trouble. It is said that there was such a story during the enemy-puppet period. A person was forced to eat three bowls and six plates of rice and was choked to death by the enemy-puppet for the two sentences "Eat more, speak less." So what can people say?</p>
<p>Otherwise, bow and make gestures of respect in all directions, with a smiling face, and tears can only be swallowed into the stomach. This is in accordance with Jesus's so-called mood: "If someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well." I read a news report from the Pinghan North Section front line on November 15th: "Xiao Peisun, the secretary-general of the Zhuoxian County Party Committee, told reporters that when he went to the countryside to inspect, he asked the ordinary people whether the Communist Party was good or the government was good. The ordinary people replied with a mournful face, 'The Communist Party is good, the government is good, the problem is with us ordinary people.' He almost burst into tears when he heard this." Who can read this passage without weeping bitterly!</p>
<p>The ordinary people's bowls are smashed, their houses are destroyed, their cattle and sheep are taken away, their chickens and pigs are slaughtered, the fields are overgrown with weeds, and the whole family has to flee in all directions and wander to other places, but they can only say "The Communist Party is good, the government is good, the problem is with us ordinary people." Isn't this even more bitter than during the Anti-Japanese War? During the Anti-Japanese War, the ordinary people could still curse the devils and the turnip heads!</p>
<p>After reading these three sentences, my eyes are full of tears. The long-accumulated resentment suddenly burst forth by these three sentences. The meaning of these three sentences is too much. Every word is a tear, every word is blood, every word is exchanged for blood and tears. And the ordinary people, under the pressure of blood and tears, can only say "The problem is with us ordinary people." I can't help but cry loudly!</p>
<h3>Heroes Devouring the People</h3>
<p>— Yu Shiyun</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's history, it can be said that it is full of stories of "heroes devouring the people." Ordinary people have always been the "flesh" on the lips of "heroes," killing them as they please and eating them as they please, which is not a big deal.</p>
<p>Confucius's saying "The people are the most important" was also because Mencius saw the suffering of the ordinary people at that time, so he spoke angrily to urge the "heroes" to be vigilant. "I would rather betray the people of the world," Cao Cao had bad intentions, but he did not lose the argument of "heroes." Huang Chao rebelled, killing people like hemp, calling the killed ordinary people "two-legged sheep," which was a step further than Cao Cao's words. During the Jingkang disaster in the Northern Song Dynasty, the "heroes" of the whole country went even further, wanting only "sons, daughters, jade, and silk," truly wanting the "flesh" and also wanting to "wear it." During the late Ming Dynasty, the roving bandits Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng built "small feet pagodas" to satisfy their desires, and knocked on bones to extract gold, already with precedents to follow for killing people for money, and there was no shortage of words for "flesh." When the Manchus entered the customs, they also copied old articles, but the "flesh" was a little unwilling, and as a result, they staged a series of "Ten Days of Yangzhou" and "Three Massacres of Jiading." The "flesh" was still "flesh," bowing its head and lying down obediently.</p>
<p>Under the conservative philosophy of "killing," the "flesh" could not help but cry out in pain. With a "wow!" it mustered up five minutes of strength and became the master of the Republic of China. A second A Dou, it could not stand on its own. Those who wielded the knife came one after another, and it was paralyzed for eight years. Fortunately, blessed by heaven, victory came, and it learned the demeanor of a great nation, "not eating for three days, bulging its belly across the bridge," acting fat with others. Some "heroes" changed their minds and raised the banner of "liberating" the "flesh" of the "ordinary people," but alas, fate was doomed! It was given the title of "liberating the flesh." Other "heroes" were also wiping their greasy mouths, hearing that they no longer regarded each other as "flesh," and even automatically an "loving the flesh" organization appeared, but I don't know how to "love" them? From then on, the "flesh" can be made! It is no longer regrettable to be "flesh"!</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Drunkenness</h3>
<p>— Dongming</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang's performance at the China Grand Theater this time featured the basic good lineup of the Chenghua Society back in the day. Except for Wang Fengqing (father of the famous Qin player Wang Shaoqing) who retired due to old age, and the famous martial female role Zhu Guifang who has passed away, almost all of them were invited. It is commendable that Xiao Changhua, who is over seventy years old, also restored his collaboration on stage.</p>
<p>It is said that Dr. Mei responded to the repeated enthusiastic requests from all walks of life and decided to post "The Drunken Concubine," which can be said to be an amazing news! This play of Drunkenness cannot be performed without singing, reciting, acting, and performance all together. Looking around the famous actors in the north and south, in the past ten years, very few have dared to touch Drunkenness, and even if they do, they do not meet the four aforementioned conditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Mei's Drunkenness has a great background; every gesture and every lift of the leg is a rule, and every movement has an origin. The state of mind after being drunk is even more incomparable to any famous actor, not to mention that Mr. Mei is the most suitable person to play Yang Guifei!</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's singing in this play can be called a must, truly doing his best in being crisp, sweet, and charming. In addition, with the Huqin of Xu Lanyuan and Wang Shaoqing, the leading figures in the contemporary Qin world, especially Shaoqing's Erhu, it can be called unprecedented. This play has the most pieces, and both insiders and outsiders regard it as a daunting task. The pieces used by Xu and Wang in this play are many good pieces that are about to be lost, such as: Huihui Tune, Fighting Crickets, etc. Mr. Mei has not performed Drunkenness for more than ten years. The last time I saw him perform Drunkenness was at the Grand Theater. The impression at that time is still vivid, but in those years, I only saw him perform it once, so Mr. Mei's "Drunkenness" can be said to be very valuable, and it is truly not easily shown. This time, he sang for more than half a month, and every performance was full. His "body" is even better than before. Thinking that he is over fifty years old and still making progress unremittingly, it is truly admirable. Thinking of his "body" in "Drunkenness," it must be wonderful to the extreme. In addition, Mr. Mei moved this old play, whose rules are about to be lost, to the stage at the cost of hard work, which is the best opportunity for latecomers to study and imitate. Do not miss it.</p>
<h3>China's Exports</h3>
<p>— Han Chan</p>
<p>The teacher was giving a geography lesson in the classroom, which was about China's foreign trade. The student Wang was impatient and stared blankly at the sky outside the window.</p>
<p>"XX: Do you know what is the most suitable export product for China today?"</p>
<p>Wang was suddenly called up by the teacher, and he didn't even hear the question clearly.</p>
<p>"You only need to say the thing that China needs the least but has the most of." The teacher was afraid that he would not understand the question, so he explained it for him.</p>
<p>"Then... only corruption."</p>
<h3>Diary of a Child</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>Where is it Difficult to Raise?</p>
<p>Yesterday, because of livelihood issues, Dad and Mom had a fight. Today, Ping Shang, Dad, like a bookworm, was swaying his head and singing: "Only women and petty people are difficult to raise." Dad said this just to vent his feelings. Unexpectedly, Mom heard it, and a big wave immediately arose, thinking it was a great insult. She didn't chop vegetables or cook rice. She had to settle accounts with him. Asking him where it was difficult to raise? "The same woman, others have a Meiling plane and fly everywhere. We are also women, but with you, a man who is not as good as a beggar, we can't even afford three meals of rice. We don't have enough clothes for all four seasons, and we have to be accused of illegally occupying the house by the landlord. We are even said to be freeloading when we take the tram. What is difficult to raise about me? What is difficult to raise?"</p>
<p>Dad felt that he was in the wrong, but for the sake of face, he was not willing to admit defeat. He still mumbled: The difficulty in raising women and petty people has an annotation, it is not to say that their material life cannot be supported, it is to say that they "resent when kept at a distance, and are not humble when close." For example, that fallen wife next door, when her husband was in the rear, she "resented" him every day for not coming back. Now that she has brought back an anti-Japanese wife, she is not "humble" at all. Isn't this difficult to raise?</p>
<p>Mom saw him talking nonsense, knowing that he felt he was in the wrong, so she sneered and didn't bother to argue anymore. But I felt quite resentful in my heart, because the example Dad gave was really full of nonsense!</p>
<p>However, regarding the "petty person" part, I must express something. Generally speaking: there are three explanations for petty person, one is morphological, one is age, and one is personality. The woman and the petty person that the sage mentioned refer to the third type of person. The first type is a dwarf, the one who collects tickets at the Chongqing Zhongshan Park Zoo; the second type is me, a child. Neither of these two is difficult to raise, so I don't need to raise a teacher to punish them.</p>
<p>An Innocent Murderer The Story of a Psychoanalyst Xu Guiting</p>
<p>The police chief asked, "How on earth did this guy climb to such a high place?" He looked gloomily at the towering building. The young police officer replied, "There is a fire escape there. He must have gone up from there."</p>
<p>"Then he must be crazy," the police chief said expressionlessly. "There is no doubt about that."</p>
<p>Mian interrupted, "I thought maybe he would jump down."</p>
<p>The police chief shrugged and said, "If he jumps down, it will save us the effort of going up to catch him."</p>
<p>"Then, can you think of a way to get him down?"</p>
<p>"The friends from the fire brigade will always find a way. They will be here soon."</p>
<p>It was almost dawn, and Mian had already seen Lusun's back on top. He seemed to be sitting there quietly, his head against the wall. Up there, he seemed very small, and a little lonely and desolate. Mian suddenly made a decision: "I must go up and come down with him."</p>
<p>"No, you can't do that," the police chief said impatiently. "I will never allow anyone to break their neck for him, and he might shoot you."</p>
<p>"I don't think he will shoot me," Mian said. "Maybe I can get him down. I'm really sorry, Chief. I can't let him stand there. He is my patient. If I hadn't let him go in the first place, this would never have happened."</p>
<p>The police chief listened and had no choice but to shake his head and say, "Okay, but..."</p>
<p>The fire engine's bell rang. The police officer said, "They're here. They also brought a ladder."</p>
<p>The fire chief said to Mian, "Hey, friend. Climbing a ladder is not fun. Climb slowly and calmly. Remember, you can rest when you like when you get halfway up, but don't look down. When you stop climbing, don't forget to fasten your belt around your body!"</p>
<p>Mian ignored everything and climbed up.</p>
<p>The fireman said happily, "Maybe he can climb up. He actually has the courage to try."</p>
<p>"Oh, he does have the courage," the police chief said dejectedly, "but don't forget, the guy up there has a gun!"</p>
<p>Mian had always been afraid of going to high places. Because of fear, he clung tightly to the ladder, and his knees had no space to bend when climbing. But he had already started climbing, so he had to do it to the end. However, he forgot the fireman's instructions and climbed desperately fast. As a result, he was out of breath halfway and felt very tired. He had to stop for a while. During that short period of time, he almost made a mistake that would have caused eternal regret, because he glanced down when he was resting. Oh my God, Mian was simply scared to death, unable to move except for holding the ladder tightly. He had to close his eyes tightly and climb upwards desperately. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Pray, How Many Tokyos Are There?</h3>
<p>— Ding Yichang</p>
<p>Many people dislike geography in school, saying it's dull and tasteless. But when they read the newspaper every morning and are confronted with a string of domestic and foreign place names, feeling somewhat lost, they regret not having enough geographical knowledge. In reality, news and geography are inseparable. Reading the news requires geographical knowledge, and geography can gain interesting recognition and deep impressions through news reports. This is a living method of memory.</p>

<p>[1] In old novels, we learned that there used to be a "Western Capital" in Shaanxi and a "Eastern Capital" in Henan. In modern times, another "Tokyo" naturally refers to the capital of Japan.

<p>C. Or in eastern Suiyuan, a transportation hub for wool and hides?</p>
<p>[6] Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland. Taiwan has two famous water conservancy projects, namely the "Sun Moon Lake Hydropower Plant" and the "Chianan Irrigation Canal." Do you think these two place names:</p>
<p>A. Are both in Tainan?</p>
<p>B. Are both in Taipei?</p>
