<h3>接收清查團組成　推定各組負責人即將出發　留京委員昨會商進形事宜</h3>

<h3>社論　壯烈的血！辛酸的淚！興奮的汗！</h3>
<p>今天是我們中國人八年問用血·淚·汗交織成的紀念日！</p>
<p>今天我們逢着第九次的「七七」，抗戰勝利以後的「七七」，而却不免感慨萬千。抗戰期間一年一度的「七七」，鞭策我們流血流汗，爭取勝利；而今年此日，勝利己光臨了十個多月，勝利的果實似乎霉爛了，前途又似乎糢糊起來，這究竟是怎麼一回事？</p>
<p>我們知道，今天全國各地，都在舉行追悼抗戰殉難軍民大會，但不知道追悼先烈的時候，大家懷着什麽情緒？先烈們流着壯烈的血，己經流芳百世，而我們今天只有報之以辛酸的淚，太說不過去吧！</p>
<p>先烈們流了血，爭得勝利，我們來追悼他們，僅僅報之以淚，我們都變成不够料的懦夫！先烈的殉難流血，確己盡了他們抗戰的歷史使命，但是抗戰勝利必須繼之以建國成功，而後先烈可以瞑目。我們追悼先烈，必須負起「建國必成」的使命，然後可以俯仰無愧，難道應該僅僅流淚嗎？不，我們應該大家流汗，流興奮的汗我們要爲復興敎育而留汗，爲恢復交通而流汗，爲整編軍隊而流汗，爲振興實業而流汗，爲建設新中國一切的一切而流汗。我們必須用工作競賽的態度，以流汗代流淚，更以流汗代流血，纔可嚐到勝利果實的滋味。若照現在的局面，渾沌紛紜的混下去，那麼先烈己有造於我們，而我們真有愧於先烈；勝利實無負於我們，而我們則有負於勝利。</p>
<p>在今天這個又辛酸，又壯烈，又興奮的紀念日，我們無論如何，抑止不住我們沉痛的回憶。蘆溝橋砲聲一響，日寇的侵略氣燄，咄咄逼人，我國一切不如敵人，但憑了最高統帥的英明領導，憑了大本營的運籌帷幄，憑了全國軍民奮起抗戰，視死如歸的精神，乃能於漫漫長夜的八年間，用血，川淚，用汗，奮鬥出一條死裏求生的路來，終於使日寇投降，在中國歷史上展開曠古未有的光榮的一頁。據國防部新聞局長鄧文儀君前天報吿，全國軍民死難的總在千萬人以上。這一頁光榮的歷史，實在就是這些千萬軍民用他們的血來寫成的。我們紀念「七七」抗戰，自然先要向千萬殉難的軍民誠摯的默哀，而且更要萬分懺悔；懺悔我們爲什麽在勝利十個月的中間，不能加倍努力，使國家踏上建設的大道，甚至速劫後小民要求一個安居樂業而不可得？想到這裏，寫到這裏，辛酸極了，淚與筆俱！</p>
<p>八年之間，平津之役，淞滬之役，台兒莊之役，徐州之役，武漢以及之戰，長沙之戰，豫鄂之戰，湘桂之戰，綏晋之戰，滇緬之戰，北起朔漠，南迄瓊崖，中國全境，半遭蹂躪，全國軍民，斷頭瀝血者，何可勝數？迨太平洋戰爭爆發，中國更遭嚴密的封鎖，外援幾絕，內力漸衰，國運之危，殆如累卵。但幸全國軍民，除了少數漢奸敗類而外，前仆後繼，奮不顧身，卒能衝破難關，渡過駭浪。每當危疑震憾之時，我領袖，往往胸有成竹，勝算獨操，世變紛紜，而指揮若定。中國之所以能轉危爲安，轉敗爲勝，以百年積弱之古國，而勝整軍經武之强鄰，最高統帥精神感召之力，後世史家，自有公論。我們有這樣英明的領袖，己經救國家於危亡；我們更深信他必能盱衡世局，針對現實，大仁大勇，即知即行，引導中國走上民主統一之大道，以奠國家永久和平之基礎。所願各黨各派，社會賢達，也都能大澈大悟，一心一德，不再爭地盤，不再擁武力，不再破壞交通，不再草菅人命，不再阻撓國民大會的召開，不再延遲國家憲法的制定，大家公爾忌私，努力建國，則殉難軍民死而有知，庶幾瞑目。</p>
<p>中國在這次抗戰中應中該是新生了！新生的力量，得之於自己的血汗，同時也得之於盟邦的援助。蘇聯發之於前，美英繼之於後。她們不但給了精神上的鼓勵，而且援助了無數物質上的實力。尤其是美國，在故羅斯福總統領導之下，用租借法案援助我們軍火，訓練我們軍隊，築雷多公路，闢駝峯航綫，甚至派遺他們的子弟，</p>
<p>到中國戰塲上駢肩作戰。而更有許多志願勇士，受陳納德將軍的指揮，成立有名的飛虎隊。凡此英勇義俠同仇敵愾的行爲，中國人民永銘心版。戰事終了以後，杜魯門總統又决心協助我們遣俘遣僑，共同管制日本，務使敵人不能再禍世界，同時堅主軍事援華，使中國能共負維持和平的責任，而馬歇爾特使更不辭勞瘁，奔走斡旋，期望中國得以和平統一。中國人民素　講信修睦，並且有以德報德的傳統精神，對於共患難的盟友，眞是無限感謝，而回顧現狀，却又覺得無限慚作。</p>
<p>今天以後，我們不可再流血了，更不必徒然流淚了！我們要在先烈的英靈之前，痛切　悔，拿出勇氣來，大家流着興奮的汁，到田園裏去，到工塲裏去，到礦穴裏去，到學校裏去，手携着手，肩並着肩，走上建國的大道！這樣來紀念此血，淚，汗交織而成的「七七」，纔是有意義的紀念！</p>

<h3>我應爲和會邀請國　王外長發重要聲明　蘇聯代表竟獨持異議　顯屬違反莫斯科協定</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕關於巴黎行將舉行之和平會議，討論對義羅保匈芬五國和約事，外長王世杰因法國係和會地主國，今午特面交法大使下列聲明，請其轉達法政府：「根據中國政府前經接受之一九四五年十月廿四日莫斯科協定，關於聯合國對義羅保匈芬五國之和約，應由英美法蘇四外長之代理人起草，而醫藥費論此項和約草案之和平會議，則應由中英美法蘇五國組成之。外長會議如集基於此點未來在巴黎舉行之和會，自應出「外長會議」全體會員國嬉集，而不僅限於英美法蘇四國，實至明顯。不然則中國政府將視爲違反前述協定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播：今日蘇聯官方發表消息，證實四強外長會議之主要問題已告解決，並謂愛好和平者對於此種成就，必感覺欣慰。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎五日電〕四強外長今日開會逾三小時半，討論廿一國和會邀請之方式及和會程序法問題。蘇外長莫洛托夫堅主中國不應爲和會之邀請國，僅能爲被邀請國，美國務卿貝爾納斯雷塲予以駁斥，認爲此乃完全錯誤而非必要之舉，等於侮辱中國。英外相貝文提出數種建議，俾使四強得以成立邀請方式之協議。關於和會程序法問題，莫洛托夫並未表示渠是否將堅持四強建議之程序法，對於參加和會其他諸國應具有拘束力，但貝爾納斯表示決不實同強迫大會接受四強提出之程序法規，四強之建議或能有所幫助，但大會應有自擬規章之重。聞四國外次已有大會程序法之初步建議提出，內容與外長會議之程序法相仿，主張爲每一和約設立一委員會，由會經與該敵國交戰之國爲委員。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎五日電〕四強外長今晚在疲倦的漚意狀態中，赴盧森壓宮繼續舉行會議。所討論僅嬉開廿一國和會之邀請方式，預料其他若乾小問題亦當　同解決。故在外長會議延會前，大約僅德奧問題尚待討論。此間觀察家以支和會嬉開之期已不遠，故對於複雜之德國問題，或不能有何發展。討論德國問題之時，法外長皮杜爾，必將要求普爾。萊茵兩區與德脫離，而美國務卿貝爾納斯仍當提出其管制德國廿五年之條約，並將籲請澈底調查德國問題，以便早日召開德國之特別和會。貝爾納斯前亦已提　出與國之和約草案，惟其他三國尚未表示意見。巴爾幹和約中最困難之問題，即爲多腦河自由通航問題，預料四國外長不久當可成立若干協議。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕名作家威爾斯今日發表一文，抨擊英王室，謂前墨索里尼政府聞曾在戰前以巨款賄賂英法西斯黨領袖莫斯來，英王室應公開聲明是否牽涉在內。威爾斯此舉殆屬史無前例。渠稱：假令英王室與之不無關係，則漢諾孚王室應隨義大利薩伏伊王室流亡國外，聽任英國回復其原有之共和傳統。墨索里尼送莫斯來巨款事，最近曾在下議院提出討論。威氏謂：美國或其他國家仍有人見制服與宮衝而饒涎欲滴，大可即在其境爲各國之流亡君后建一「王族退休團」。此種上下其手之巨款內情如何？英王室與之有何關係？舉世純正之民主社會必須知之。關於此事，內長艾特會於上月六日向下議院宣讀義前駐英大使葛蘭第致墨索里尼兩函，內有一九三六年義政府以巨款致送莫斯來事。據某一報告：莫斯來每年自義國得款廿四萬一千六百十二萬元，莫斯來則矢口否認其事。戰爭期內莫斯來始被捕入嶽。英王室如何牽涉在內，威爾威斯並未說明。</p>
<p>〔又電〕英名作家威爾斯在「社會主義領導」週刊所著抨擊王室一文，大多數英人尚未能即獲一讀，因該週刊現僅有少數報攤發售，兩萬定戶將於明日始能接到。倫敦記者評稱：此爲愛德華八世遜位後最嚴重之事，威氏此文，殆與英報界之傳統習慣不相符合，英報向不攻擊英王與后，英人認爲此種習慣非常公平，因英王與后爲立憲君王，未經政府通過，對外界攻擊不能答辯。</p>

<h3>土肥原曾計劃在華北組五省自治政權　田中連日供述陰謀秘聞</h3>
<p>訓練蘇作戰軍兩百六十萬</p>
<p>〔改造社東京六日電〕今日國際法庭續審戰犯，被告平沼，大川均因病未到。開審後仍由證人田中隆吉，答覆薩開脫檢察官之訊問，各關係被告之表情，頓形緊張　侧垣大將聳耳靜聽，佐藤，賢丁則屈身以視，狀似恨其饒舌，又不能令其不言，而呈興奮之色。橋本上校則忙於筆錄，以便抗辯。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京六日電〕日前陸軍省兵務局長田中隆吉今日續供日軍侵華陰謀，稱建州曾謂「事變即使發生。國內形勢未必支持關東軍之行動。當時若觀內閣即反對此舉，一九三一年十月事件，即以傾覆日政府以解決東北事變爲目的，本人曾極力支持此事。」一九四三年晤見長勇少校，渠亦稱：「事變係關東軍所計劃，東北問題因中村震太郎上尉事件及萬實山事件，益趨險惡，故須乘機澈底解決。參加計劃者，關東軍以坂垣，石原爲中心，日本本國以本人爲中心，稱本完全採納本人之意見，在民間則有在川一派人支持本人意見。十月事件幾係以本人爲中心，但石原中校則頗表反對，餘爲將陸軍中央部拖向支持滿洲獨立起見，宣傳如反對關東軍之行動，則關東軍將獨立，其實關東軍並無一人抱此思想。述及被告南次郎與幣原之對立時稱：一九三五年秋，南語余曰：「余因在閣議發表代表陸軍之積極論，致時與對東北問題抱有消極態度之幣原外相對立。」</p>
<p>擁吳佩孚出山</p>
<p>繼談及東條任關東軍參謀長時統治東北之勢力稱：因東條之計劃，東北之政治，經濟，國防，發展極速，當時「滿洲國」之重要人事，非得東條同意不可。其次就「華北五省自治政權」談稱：該運動係於一九三五年四月開始，目的在樹立蒙古自治政權，及在除去蒙古地帶之華北樹立自治政權。由一九三五年六月「梅津——何應欽協定」成立時起，即急遽發展。華北五省由華北駐屯軍，蒙古地帶由關東軍擔任，圖完成自治運動。一九三五年九月，土肥原少將奉關東軍司令官南次郎命令，赴華北努力從事自治運動。據餘所憶，土肥原當時希望擁立同孚樹立五省自治政府，但未成功。其後經土肥原之努力，一九三五年十一月，在冀察兩省成立兩政權。上述自治，運動之唆使者，係閣江軍司令官南大將及華北駐屯軍司令官梅津中將。派遣土肥原赴華北之目的乃在華北樹立自治政權，使與日本及「滿洲國」發生密切關係，俾有用於防共。梅津對自治運動雖一任其部下參謀長酒井隆上校進行。然在職權上領導自治政權。則係事實。據土肥原對南次郎之報告：冀察，冀東兩政權雖不滿意，尚符合關東軍之希望。嗣後將以冀察爲中心，加以擴大。冀察政權樹立後至翌年三月間，土肥原在北平任該政權顧問，依日本之希望，指導其政治經濟。</p>
<p>蒙古自治政府</p>
<p>田中繼即述及渠與德王之關係稱：餘曾晤見德王，其目的在使外蒙之自治委員會與日本密切聯絡。以德王爲中心，樹立自治政權。並援助建立渠所希望之獨立國家。初，德王表示不願，至一九三五年八月；因南次郎之努力，終乃互訂提携信久，關東軍亦約將來援助。該政權與「滿洲國」不同，係及德王之希望，由日本輔佐，並非由晶本隨意管制。南次郎及板填均係「蒙古自治政府」之熱心支持者。東條當時並無關係。但中日事變後，率兵入內蒙古樹立「蒙古自治政府」者，乃東條之部隊。最後就關東軍之訓練作重要證言稱：「滿洲國」爲國防上實行蘇作戰之訓練，其假想敵俘蘇聯，太平洋戰爭發生後，此項軍隊被送往南方。被訓練之關東軍，其數約二百五，六十萬人。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京六日電〕田中昨下午供述東北事變真相，謂東北事變係依計劃而成，並非突發事件。該計劃之中心人物係參謀本部第一部長立川少將，機會之橋本中將，長少將，及民間之大川周明博士。關東軍之主要計劃者，據長，橋　本兩人所述，則係板垣上校及石原中校。計劃之目的，板垣，橋本，長等所言各異；。據本人之主觀，係在打開陷於僵局之國內局勢及中日關係，爲此驅逐東北中國軍閥，作成「王道樂土」實行東北之「啓發的改革」，使成爲亞洲之安定勢力。</p>
<p>滿洲事變計劃</p>
<p>橋本曾謂「滿洲事變係關東軍所計劃，余爲匡正當時紊亂之政治，努力支持關東軍之行動，十月事件亦係爲此而與長少校所計劃者，但歸於失敗主，惟滿洲之獨立則成功。初欲佔領滿洲，但爲避免國際摩擦，認爲造成國家爲宜。「滿洲國」於焉成立。一橋本雙謂：「使滿洲成爲復與亞洲之基地。」參加東北事變者，僅關東軍，而其中心係板垣及石原，橋本本人於東北事變前力謀解決東北問題，又在國內企圖革新，計劃十月事件。據長少校言：十月事件係謀暗殺政治家，樹立新政府，而使日本國民支持東北事變。大用當時任「滿鐵東亞經濟調查局」理事長。橋本常與渠談東北問題及革新國內問題。板垣於事變時任關東軍最高參謀，橋本曾謂渠與石原爲關東平之中心人物。彼等謂若權內關對東北問題，態度極軟，倘反對彼等之政策，則彼等將於東京實行暴動，傾覆政府，一舉解決東北問題。板垣之意見，以爲炸斃張作霖後，中日關係迅速亞化，外交交涉殊難解決東北問題，故叭有以武力解決，驅逐張學良政權，造成各民族共存共榮之樂土，使亞洲各國視日本爲盟主，並脫離白人之勢力。</p>
<p>强佔瀋陽前後</p>
<p>關於九一八當時情形，據板垣談稱：當時依永田鐵山之意見，置二十厘營；事變時，一門用以轟擊北大營，一門用以轟擊瀋陽城，威力甚大，中國軍隊未作任何抵抗，進行順利。大砲秘密置於審陽步兵營內，「滿鐵」路軌即在彈程距離內。板垣於事變時回國，謂「滿洲國」已採取日本所希望之開態。「滿洲國」由關東軍執其內面指權，導其重要人事由其「總務廳」掌理，然須得關東軍參謀長之同意。其重要經濟產業均在日政府統制之下，政黨除「協用會」外不許成立。關於國防，由日將校入「滿洲國軍政府」爲顧問，與關東軍密切聯絡。一九三四年建川中將任姬路師團長時。曾與之談及東北事變。建川謂：渠早已料及該事變，「九月十日·六日。若觀內閣接獲瀋陽總領事電報。內稱撫順守備隊長謂一週內將發生大事件，乃向南陸相强硬抗議，南陸相乃派餘爲特使赴瀋陽，制止該事件。十八日傍晚抵審陽，關東軍恐爲人所制，拒不見人，乃爲「奉天特務機關」輔佐官花谷少校帶往酒樓。晚間大砲聲發作，妓女聞之戰憟，余在東軍知餘在此，並不礙事，然妓女等仍股憟不已。余酣眠一晚，翌晨花谷來接，時事件已發生，余之使命乃未能達成」。</p>

<h3>參觀試騐原子彈後　美議員來華訪問　華萊氏在記者招待會談話　對某方反美舉動表示遺憾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國會參議員艾倫特，勃羅斯德，勃脫勒，曁衆議員倍爾，羅賓遜，兄勞馥，李康　，密勒及華萊等一行九人，此次代表杜魯門總統參加菲列賓獨立紀，除倍爾外，餘八人於前日由馬尼刺來滬觀光。昨日下午三時，在美新聞處，由艾倫特，勃羅斯德，勃脫勒，密勒及華來等五人出席記者招待會。各議員對於上海均有極佳印象，並對招待熱忱表示感激。</p>
<p>其中華萊氏以私人立塲發表意見稱：在余未來滬前，曾聞及若干華人有反美行動，現已獲證實。至所以造成此種行動之原因，余不得而知，但無論如何是項情形，實不應存在。中美兩國在戰時乃極好之盟友，希望以後仍能繼績之。並望發動此暴行者，勿忘中國尚有三千美軍失踪，並勿忘在戰時美國對中國及全世界之貢獻。</p>
<p>共和黨員勃羅斯德表示對此問題，可不必過於重視，美國亦有兩黨，互相反對，甚至民主黨員本身對杜魯門總統之政策執行方回亦有異議，但兩黨對於杜總統或故總統羅斯福之外交政策，均絕對贊同，並對馬歇爾元帥具有極大信心。美兵駐華其目的在協助中國消滅戰爭危機，至外界種種宣傳，余認爲均屬過於誇大，外傳美政府供應中國國民黨巨量物資事實上並無此事。以一九三四年爲例，盛傳美接濟中國物資七千餘噸，實則僅得四千噸，故望美國記者能協助闢謠，並望中美兩國，以後無論在經濟上，建設上，均能交換人員，互相訪問，不僅嘉惠兩國，且增加諒解，共同促進世界和平。</p>
<p>密勤氏生長舊金山，對於中國特感興趣，並謂渠等此次參加菲列賓獨立紀念，深感美國四十六年來同情菲人，協助菲列賓爭取自由，而對菲列賓獨立諾言予以實現，今後美國與遠東國家合作精神，由此可見。勃脫勒氏亦稱此次來華雖係首次，但並非以生客地位而來，中美兩國距離雖遠，但父通工具發達後，來往不成問題，希望中國能發展交通，任何人均可赴美。</p>
<p>諸議員來遠東途中，曾參觀原子彈試騐，認爲此次試騐雖不如理想中之成功，但原子力之威脅，當無可否認，渠等觀察時，遠離爆炸地點十英里之遠，故不能有所正確判斷，而此彈投彈高度及大小均不得而知。第二次試騐在七月二十五日，想可有進一步之成績表現。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕埃及棉業考察團一行六人，自三日由加爾各答飛滬後，即分住華懋與都城兩飯店，連日分訪我紡織界人士交換意見，並曾迭與中紡公司商談。該團團長馬華棣氏昨晨與記者晤談時，首先聲明並非埃財政部長而僅係財部之一員，繼述及此次任務稱：目的在考察戰後中國棉紡業之需要，並協助其復興紡織工業。馬氏甚誇其本國棉種之優良，謂棉花爲埃及最主要之農產物，乃埃及經濟之基石，其產量幾達全世界產量百分之八十。並稱，戰後第一批埃棉業於旬日前運達本埠，唯日來與中紡公司之商談，迄尚未獲結果，良以埃棉遠較印棉及美棉價高，且因織維較短，不合我紡織業之需要。埃棉考察團並會於昨日下午與本邑紡織業協會有所商談定下週四返國。</p>

<h3>甜津津的糖　說不盡的苦</h3>
<p>是「壟斷」？是「暴利」？　二千元一斤未免嚇壞人</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕甜津津的糖，却含着說不盡的苦味上海的二百五十家加入糖業公會的糖行與零售商都在抱怨目前統制着食糖產銷的台俗糖業股份有限公司，壟斷着臺灣「中砂」，控制着價格的上落。他們担憂，長此以往，上海糖商將趨於崩潰。</p>
<p>糖商怪台灣糖公司「有貨不賣」以致該公司未成立前每担六萬餘元的市價，到現在反漲了百分之五十以上（昨市十萬〇四千）。台灣糖公司於漲價歸咎於糖商，說他們是「暴利，雖然還未能確實指出，其中難免沒有投機囤積的事情」。</p>
<p>這種爭執很快便引起了各方面的注意，據說宋院長與資源委員曾等負責當局，昨晚又曾會商，籌調節產，運，銷關係的合理辦法，並抑低糖價。</p>
<p>台灣糖業公司是資源委員會與臺灣行政長官公署合辦的運銷機構。台糖的出口與在滬分配銷售，便是這國營機關的事業。</p>
<p>台灣糖業公司成立於五月一日，當時它從原管理合糖的『台灣糖業接管委員會」，接收得「中砂」十五萬噸，製造砂糖的原料九萬噸。田於運輸工具的不敷應用，由他們每月運滬的砂糖約萬噸。這數量其實是足敷食用的。</p>
<p>上海是全國食糖集散的中心。每月銷售量在一萬二千餘噸左右。本市消耗百分之卅，運往外埠如平津京漢蘇錫等地的約佔百分之七十。中國所需食糖，大宗來源不外二個：爪哇與台灣。菲列賓與巴西雖然也產糖，但前者要供應美國，後者價格過高，無法銷售到中國來，甚至台糖，在戰前也因爲價格較爪哇的「荷蘭糖」每斤要高出美金一二分，也無從跟爪哇競爭。但是戰火摧毀了爪哇的一百二十五家煉糖廠的大部，今後中國的食糖消耗將整個仰給於台灣、而這個台灣糖業公司便成了今後中國所有食糖者唯一的主宰。</p>
<p>台灣糖業公司開業之初，在五月廿四日，向申請的正式糖商與消費合作社售出了第一批台糧，每祖價六萬六千元（當時市價七萬〇五百元），總數是一千噸。以後每隔一週，售出一批，數量與傻務供與前無多大差別。直到第四期，市價繼起至八萬一千元，公司售價也漲到七萬三。這時起了謠言，說將停止配售。</p>
<p>很　明的，價格是從第四期起開始上漲的，到六月二十日，臺灣糖業公司直接向市塲拋售出三百噸，價格漲到了九萬八千元。第二日，塲人心大軟，以爲該公司必將繼續抑價拋售，誰知還是九萬八千，數量减爲二百噸，於是市價又復回上。</p>
<p>據說，台灣糖業公司根據市價訂定它的售價，每担給予商人一個九九扣，並除去袋皮二斤，允許的利潤是百分之十五。糖商似乎也有苦處，高達二角的黑市拆息，再加上棧下力等等，以目前向公司訂得所謂「路貨」的進價九萬八千元，加上開支，售十萬〇四千元，怪不得要叫苦了。國積者固然是有暴利可得，但糖商們自辯說：「我們週轉的資金還不够，何來大事囤積。」</p>
<p>糖商又說：「台灣成本加上運輸費用，總計不過五萬左右，現在賣十萬，盈利的不是公司麼？我們寗願公司將價格定低，多做少賺」。他們坦白的說：「官方機構尚且不願逐步抑價，我們是商人，難道不想將本求利」。</p>
<p>台灣糖業公司將來貨不豐，歸咎到沒有船隻，對市塲漲價原因，說是：「第四期起，存底的實情給透露了出去，市塲上便相率抬價」。究竟誰漲誰的價，一直爭執到現在。</p>
<p>今日的台灣糖業公司與糖商，似乎已對立在深谷的兩崖，戟指怒目，這個說：「你暴利！」那個說：「你壟斷！」—渴望着甜食的人，空懷着一顆迷惘的心，仰望着每斤二千元的糖價垂涎。（仲實）</p>
<h3>首批遣歸德僑　七百餘人今離滬　秀斯德等可望免遣　未報到者數人就逮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市目批遺歸之德僑，共七百卅八人。除昨日有十二人未報到外，全部已於昨日登美軍艦「羅賓」號，準備於今晨五時離滬。該批撤退名單中，尚包括來自廣東·漢口·甫京·及濟南等地者五十七人。在離集中營前，曾經海關人員負責一一檢查，秩序尚佳。又失踪之十二人，當局正加緊搜索中。迄昨日深晚止，開已有數人就逮。據悉：已登輪之德僑中，日前己有一孩死亡，死因不明。傳另有數孩，亦已染百日咳，頗有蔓延之勢，惟患者業經隔離。又此次撤退之名單中，有秀斯德夫婦（Ernst　Schuster）。倫特夫婦Em　sLund），及海賽爾（Michael　von　Hasel）等。若輩已由美籍律師阿樂滿氏，代向地方法院申請出庭證，俾便從實偵查若　之反納粹身份，而求免予撤離。聞阿氏曾以若輩之名，詢諸美國務及陸軍兩部，均證明與納粹份子無關。此中秀斯德已旅華垂廿一年。曾任考士模紙業公司總經理。一九三七年時，秀氏曾請歸化爲美籍，惟後以戰事爆發而未果。秀氏在滬戰時，曾爲本報在楊樹浦區搶運白報紙數百令。海賽爾曾由「聯總」確認爲布魔執政時之政治逃亡者，素以反納粹著稱，「行總」署長蔣廷黻亦曾具函證明云。</p>
<h3>配售米糧　全市劃分三十二區　白米每石規定五萬一千</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市米號業同業公會，於昨日下午二時假庫倫路二一二號米業北市塲，舉行理監事及各區米號業代表聯席會議，出席共四十餘人，議決各案，擇要誌後：（一）以後配售食米，決根據全市劃分卅二區單位，實行分區配售制，逐日分配數區米號出售食米，輪値受配之區，該區內所有會員米店，是日內均有米出售，以免市民奔走覓索。（二）要據各米號過云銷數多　，將各米號分為甲乙兩等。甲等每日配售廿石，乙等配售十三石。（三）各米號門售分配之食米，其價格均須一律，越米及白米每石爲五萬一千元，贛米每石爲四萬七千元。（四）請市政府從速組成米價番議委員會，俾便鼓勵糧商，赴產區購米來滬，以合理價格供售。</p>
<p>又邇來以產區米價，較滬行爲高。故一般米商，均無法販運。聞米價審議會之設，即在鼓勵米商赴產區購米。該會將根據採購成本，決定合理價格，然後由採辦米商，依價供售。現聞已有若干米號，購米運滬。惟以米價審議會尚未成立，出售價格無從決定。而一方面則催購之客戶紛至沓來，故極感苦悶。昨日河南路泰山米號即因以六萬六千元之價，出售自辦之白米，而遭檢舉，米號業方面特向記者指稱此爲苦悶之一大例證云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕社會局新設之糧食課，已於前日開始辦公，據課長吉明齋吿記者稱：該課之重要工作，首在分配食米予各米號。欲澈底解決米荒，尚須政府與米商切實合作。</p>
<h3>本市財政一筆賬　四月盈餘五月虧</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據財政局主任秘書錢健夫稱：本市財政統計結果，三月份虧二億元，四月份盈二十七億元，五月份又虧二十五億元，其中以四月份成績最佳，主要原因爲四月份係稅收旺月，加以新市長上任之初，各方面情形皆現緊張。而五月份成績最差之原因爲時屆夏令，天氣炎熟，遊樂塲與飲食肆之榮業淸淡，職是之故，此後三月稅收，恐未可樂觀，則今後本市財政入不數出，爲必然之現象。雖經中央改變收支系統，將若千直接稅提成撥父地方當局，然因有許多稅尚未開徵（如土地稅）有許多稅尚未移交（如營業稅等）。故對於本市之財政困難，並未因之而獲得解决。至於中央所頒布之提高公務人員待遇，六月份由國庫撥欵補助，而七月份起，須由市財政局負担矣。記者問及目前財政與前英工部局之比較如何？答稱：以前英工都局每年亦有虧損，成以發行公債彌補，然目前市財政局無權發行公債，故本身拮据情形，亦不能由自身解决。</p>

<h3>輪船業公會　商承運救濟物資　設立濟運組主管承運分配事宜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海輪船業公會，爲準備行總取消租賃英船合同以後之運輸問題，特於昨日下午三時，假香港路銀行俱樂部，舉行同業會議。到各輪船公司代表程餘齊·黃佳秋·李雲良等五十餘人。首由李雲良報吿向政府要求維護航權及航業之各種具體措施，各同業一致對宋院長之採納民情，協助航業建設，表示敬意，並全體議決關於救濟物資之承運辦法。航業公會將設立救濟物資承運組，簡稱濟運組，由公會推派代表三人，國營招商局及行總各推派代表一人組織濟運委員會，以決定關於承運救濟物資及船舶分配等問題。並設總幹事一人，幹事數人，負責辦理該項事務。各輪船公司並需簽具志願書，聲明自願承運救濟物資，以協助善後救濟工作之進行，維護本國之航權。各航商因太古怡和輪船已退出沿海，爲整頓業務，並分配航綫起見，特組沿海航綫同業會議，以維持華南華北各航綫交通。此項組織與已經設立之長江航錢同業會議及滬蘇浙閩航業會議，構成一較完善之航業組織，航業界對宋院長之支持購置大批船隻分配各航錢，以替代戰前日本在遠東航業界地位之事，亦經詳細討論，並專設委員會籌劃切設施步驟及業務計劃。</p>
<h3>太古怡和</h3>
<p>改組不致實現</p>
<p>據輪船業同業公會秘書長李雲良言，宋院長此次核准四口通商，純爲疏暢物資運輸，惟爲應航業界要求起見，已將四口之蕪湖·九江取消，保留南京及漢口，以應特殊需要。此所謂特殊需要，即上海港口太擠，不得不開放二口以疏通運輸，惟航業界方面仍請求宋院長愼重考慮。關於太古怡和改組華商之事，李氏以為僅係傳說，不致實現。</p>

<h3>三審艷屍案　林步武供　恨她傲慢</h3>
<p>諭定十三日宣判</p>

<h3>哈吉牙合甫談新疆近情　今後治新要圖　首須建立民族感情</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者日昨往訪新疆國大代表，與哈吉牙合甫氏詳談新疆近情，略誌如次:新疆係我國邊防要地，過去由於政府力量之鞭長莫及，顯與中央之關係，頗有隔閡。乃自抗戰以後，始爲國人所注意。就目前我國內政之情勢而言，新疆問題之複雜，不亞於東九省。一般人認爲新疆是一政治間題，其實，民族問題尤較政治問題爲重要；伊寧事件即係新疆民族問題之一具體反映。伊寧事件之解決，誠屬張治中將軍主政新疆之第一個美滿收穫，惟伊寧事件之解決，並不能視爲新疆民族問題之根本解決，尚待今後繼續努力。新疆全省共有十餘家報紙，計分漢文，維文，哈文，俄文四種版式，各地報紙名稱統一，均爲「新疆日報」。報紙之銷路，近年銳减，數年前可銷二萬餘份之報紙，而今僅銷一千餘份，此足以反映政府對於邊疆文化工作推行之失敗。敎育方面，亦復如是。新疆全省各級學生之數字，現僅保存數年前之四分之一，究共原因，實基於前吳主席倡導「同化政策」與「通婚政策」，以致引起新疆人民之恐怖與不滿之心理，而不復令其子弟入學，以免遭受「同化」之危險。新疆省人口，外間每稱之爲四百萬人，實際上不止此數，當在六百萬人以上。其中維吾爾族（維族即突厥族）約佔四百五十萬人。新疆之生活程度，戰前及抗戰初期，原甚低微，迨至近年，高漲不已，已居全國之首位，原因是人口激增，物資貧乏，供不應求，交通不便，外地物資之輸入困難。另一原因則係受幣制之影響，蓋以新疆幣一元，僅能折合法幣五元之故也。哈吉牙合甫係維烏爾族人，據渠之主張，政府今後治理新疆，當以迅確建立民族感情列爲首要工作部門。</p>

<h3>美鈔港票仍形疲怯烚赤市況漸穩定　較前收回升二萬五</h3>
<p>烚赤昨人心稍定，是開平和，開後即自一九一萬逐漸微升，中央配給二十九條，價減爲一九二萬二五，此時始終在一九二萬左右盤旋，別無他變，近午風浪稍平，金價亦站定於一九三萬光景，午後逢週六，缺少變化，喊價微堅，結果較前收回升二萬五，飾金紋爭均乏變動，暗拆平穩，息價站二角左右。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍形疲怯，不逮烚赤遠甚，晨初曾微升至二五一〇元，即被賣方所包圍，中途曾小至二四七〇元，午刻在二四九〇元左右掙扎，午後仍鮮變化，週六關係更無活動，結果較前收微挫二十元，對黃金套價可提升至七七〇元對十兩，港票亦供過於求，再降五元，港匯五四〇元，印匯六六〇元，英匯八千六，都呈過剩，乏人維持，美匯仍乏變化。</p>
<h3>金融並無問題　銀行公會表示</h3>
<p>昨報載某錢莊缺單甚鉅，又稱另有某某等二三家金融機關「亦有問題」云云，頃據銀行公會某理事及錢業公會某理事稱，行莊交換後，非多單即缺單，行莊中有時缺單，本屬常事，星期五確有某錢莊缺額較多，然遠不如某報所刊數字之鉅，且當晚業已被足，至其所稱某某等家有問題云云，公會更未有所聞，總之，現在行莊存款性質，時來時去，不如戰前之穩定，確爲事實，而實際則市面銀根，一般的以鬆弛之日爲多，自六月底銀根一度奇緊後，至本月初，業已回鬆，同業方面，最近已大都採取穩健態度，金融風潮，不致發生，社會人士殊不宜率爾以無根之談，自相驚擾云。</p>
<p>又訊，本市銀錢業自六底假滿開市後，因中央銀行抽緊銀根，致有行莊數家，週轉不靈，茲悉各該行莊已於前日設法至下午十二時始將銀根軋齊，昨晨一律照常營業。如浦東銀行，敦裕錢莊及信託公司兩家，均已臨時解決困難，聞同業間亦多予以支援，以免擴大風潮，昨午上海票據交換所負責人稱，前日未及了結之行莊數家，已於當日設法補足，昨日上市交換者，並無變更云。</p>

<h3>柏油漲風已戢</h3>
<p>柏油正當皂用之際，故上月間漲上二萬餘元，且各產地亦均隱市飛騰，因是本有續漲可能，其奈近日市上銀根奇緊，致各皂廠辦貨泰半審愼，交易未見熱鬧，市面雖不致回鬆，然殊少精采，聞敵僞產業處理局委託海關標賣，共有一千五六百擔，已有人標得，勢必在市上銷售，此批貨品極次，售價當然便宜，所以近期內恐不致續漲，各行售價未有變更，計開如下，禾本八萬六千元，內坪油八萬元，獨砠油七萬六千元，的干油七萬八千地獄，普通蘭油七萬二千元麻城油七萬元。</p>
<h3>呢羢交易漸旺</h3>
<p>昨日巡視棋盤街及衣社長樂諸處，呢絨交易，漸有起色，然均限於秋冬之深色，夏季淡色薄貨，除直接指定零剪者外，批發雖照市便宜三五千元一碼，亦元實地受主，一般跑街擁客轉手生意，莫不齊較週初爲夥，標準則無甚大上落，細毛貨似較堅活，因本客各幫買辦，均欲細毛呢羢也，賣方鑒市貨之缺，但欲扳漲，然離實銷究屬尚有二月，雙方不得不加算利息，兼美國貨續有進口，英國貨出香港轉口運申，已在途中，以致目今星期空檔期內，買者皆不願再出高價。</p>

<h3>疲風籠罩證券市塲　熱門股東亦無力抵抗</h3>
<p>華股再告不支，大股熱門初時希圖抵抗，不久即告潰散，小股上塲即疲，惟低後頗多見賤吸收者，反告轉定，一反前日情況，永紗由四三五元退至三九五元，美亞自三七〇〇元退至三三〇〇元，景福自一九〇元退至一七五元，新光自二〇〇元退至一八五元，勤興自一六〇元退至一四二元，午刻大股僅稱平定，小股則均稍回穩，結果較前收計永紗美亞各跌一成，景福新光勤興跌半成左右，冷門中型平平，小型及元老股均被帶小半成左右，交易未見暢達。</p>
<p>外股昨仍在臨收時告跌甚鉅，雖有大戶不時吸收，無如銀根仍緊，大部份均屬老多存貨斬殺，買氣終被壓倒，怡紗自晨開七四〇〇元退至七千元，英聯自七千元退至六六〇〇元，而後稍平，除業廣呆滯，喊價未蒙影響外，餘者泰半失色，結果較前收怡紗英聯會德豐亞洲各跌一成光景，怡啤紙業鋼業挫落半成，業廣獨平。</p>
<h3>紗市人心漸定　現棉易尚佳</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉入穩境，不拘大廠小型，俱有問津，交易雖不見多，然人心因是而定，廿支紗約漲五千至一萬五千元，四十二支因前日紡建只有筒子紗供售，織廠需要轉股，獨好五六萬，卅二支藍鳳細紗，亦跟漲三萬，粵幫略有去胃。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉報漲六至九磅音，計近期美金三一·〇六，遠期三一·三〇，米特林現貨三一·七三，本埠現棉交易尚佳，民營紗廠如申新·大生·嘉豐·慶豐·等紗廠均有採辦市價續形緊俏</p>
<h3>金勾尾回復原盤</h3>
<p>木耳香蓀貨稀價俏</p>
<p>金勾必日前大批抵滬後，價雖略挫，然因產地成本過高，號家未肯輕脫，尤爲時令所需，各路去化不弱，茲已回復原盤，木耳自粵溫台三幫動辦後，行存較薄，來貨又少，而本街內地銷亦尚暢，故見步砌不已，香蓀干貝缺俏，其他各貨受銀根影響，均由定轉呆。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉，目前我國對外進出口貿易物資，除一部採取易貨辦法外，其由中央信託局代理政府經辦之數字，約佔全部總額三分之一，其餘大部仍操諸商民手中，最近之統計，出口物資輸往英美及蘇聯者，以豬業，桐油，生絲爲大宗，辦往日本者以鹽及麥麩爲主。進口物資，包括木料，報紙，麵粉，米，人造絲，鐵路器材，五金，顔料，蠶種，桑種等等。進口物資與出口物資之比例，係四與一之比。倘交通情形有利，進口物資尚有增加趨勢。政府對出口物資，希望甚大，惟以國內工價及外匯率等原因，在短時期以內，出口物資之增加，尚不容樂觀。</p>

<p>爭取和平與建設　請重溫八年艱苦抗戰史！  ……本報資料室……　　蘆橋烽煙　　八年對日抗戰，值得說是民國史上最偉大的一頁，也同時是最艱辛的一頁。我們回溯一段歷史，實在有無限的悲憤·驚怖·興奮·歡忭之情！　　當民國二十六年七七事變發生之際，在國際上由於英法蘇之間矛盾，和歐洲的綏靖政策下，正是民主國家步步退讓，法西斯國家氣燄萬丈的時候，而中國國內卻正在由「安內攘外」而轉向團結禦侮，誠然是國力疲竭，民生未蘇，但是在民族生存的大危機下，已呈現苊團結自強的偉大意志，預備邁向統一的道途。日本帝國主義者看準了這一點，它不能讓中國由統一而強大，它迫不及待地發動了戰爭。　　「七七」事變如同「九一八」事變，熱河佔領，綏遠戰爭，以至冀東政變一模一樣，決不是偶然的事件，而是日本帝國主義者一手包辦，蓄意挑釁的行動。但是和「九一八」以至冀東政變所不同的是中國反響。七月七日夜間，日軍在蘆溝橋演習尋釁事件發生以後，中國政府雖然仍一本其愛好和平的立塲，循外交途徑與日方折衝交步，以求和平解決，然而日本一方面在談判中節外生枝，出爾反爾，一方面源源增調軍隊入關，繼續尋釁，並陸續派遣海軍戰艦來華示威，和平顯然不是片面的願望所能成就。所以七月十七日，蔣委員長在蘆山發表談話，闡明中國內求自存，外求共存的基本態度，並明白揭示解決事件的最低立塲四點：「（一）任何解決不得侵害中國主權與領土的完整；（二）冀察行政組織，不容任何不合法之改變；（三）中央政府所派地方官吏，如冀察政務委員會委員長宋哲元等，不能任人要求撤換；（四）第廿九路軍現在所駐地域，不能受任何約束。最後並沉痛宣示：「我們希望和平而不求茍安，準備應戰而決不求戰。我們知道全國抗戰以後之局勢，就祇有犧牲到底，無絲毫僥倖求免之理。如果戰端一開，那就是地無分南北，年無分老幼，無論何人皆有守土抗戰之責任，皆應抱定犧牲一切之決心。」這是一篇荘嚴神聖的宣方，它昭告世人，同胞以及敵人中國爭取和平的最大限度，和爭取生存的最後決心。　　自這一聲明發表以後，日本知道不可能把蘆溝橋事件依照「九一八」以來的事件解決，它更積極作軍事上的準備，改派香月清司代替田代任華北駐屯軍司令，二十五日日軍乘我軍換防突然襲佔團河，同時由天津開往廊坊日軍亦與我軍衝突，日方依此爲藉口，向宋哲元提出最後通牒，曹宋哲元嚴詞拒絕，北平戰事擴大，次日宋下令總攻，於是交涉了二十餘晶的蘆溝橋案已是完全破壞。中日戰事的由局部的擴展爲全面的戰爭也大致確定。蘆溝橋　今昔觀　　（上）勝利後首次「七七」前夕，可愛的羊羣又在蘆溝橋頭活躍了。　　（下）敵人佔領前的蘆溝橋的雄姿，今日依然兀立，有「以不變御萬變」之槪。　　（宋致泉攝）全面的戰鬭熱烈的團結　　當蘆溝橋的烽火開始蔓延到平津，而全國的局面還處於暴風雨前夕底緊張氛圍中的時候，在上海展開了全面的抗戰。　　日本既發動了華北的戰爭，它爲了牽制華中兵力，爲了成就其速戰速決的迷夢，它一定要攫取這個作爲中國經濟文化中心的上海。八月九日乃藉口虹橋機塲事件啓釁，（日軍駐滬海軍陸戰隊中尉大山勇夫和齊藤要藏二人乘坐汽車，並携帶武器企圖衝入虹橋飛機塲，與守塲衛兵衝突。）雖然中間經各國領事出面調停，但日方蓄意挑戰絕無談判誠意。所謂外交折衝只不過是軍事部署的掩飾。到八月十二日調集淞滬的日艦已有二十餘艘之多，海陸軍萬餘人，登陸的已及二三千人且不斷向中國保安隊挑釁，所以中國當局也不得不臨時加緊調入十七，八十八兩師來滬鞏固防務，次日早上九時，閘北發生前哨衝突，下午四時許日軍開始大舉進攻，並以大砲轟擊，這就是八一三全面抗戰的揭幕。　　八月十四日，國民政府發表自衛抗戰：「中國今日鄭重聲明，中國之領土主權，已橫受日本之侵略；國際盟約，九國公約，非戰公約，已爲日本所破壞無餘，此等條約其最大目的，在維持正認與和平，中國以責任所在，自應盡其能力，以維護其領土主權，及維護上述各種條約之尊嚴，中國決不放棄領土之任何部分，遇有侵略，惟有實行天賦之自衛權以應之。」同時中國空軍首先出動，轟炸敵艦，在海空激戰。上海市民以及全國人民以鼓舞激動的情緒響應政府自衛抗戰。　　在國內團結禦侮的一致要求中產生了一舉國一致的全面抗戰，在這全面的抗戰當中當更求全國的團結一致，所以八月二十二日國民政府正式命令改編紅軍爲國民革命軍第八路軍，並任命朱德彭德懷爲八路軍正副指揮，二十五日朱彭通電就職，九月二十二日政府發表了中國共產黨七月間即已提出的共赴國難宣言，與蔣委員長接納共黨宣言的談話，在中共方面爲了和平統一團結禦侮，向全國宣方：（一）中山先生的「三民主義」爲中國今日所必需，本黨願爲其　底的實現而奮鬥；（二）取消一切推翻中國國民黨政權的暴動政策及赤化運動，停止以暴力沒收地主土地的政策；（三）取消現在的蘇維埃政府，實行民權政治，以期全國政權之統一；（四）取消紅軍名義及番號改編爲國民革命軍，受國民政府軍事委員會之統轄，並待命出動，擔任抗戰前線之職責。同時　蔣委員長亦以極坦白誠懇的態度表示：「今日凡爲國國民，但能信奉三民主義而努力救國者政府當不問其過去如何而咸使有效忠國家之機會，對於國內任何派別祇要誠意救國，願在國民革命抗敵禦侮之旗幟下共同奮鬥者，政府無不開誠接納咸使集中於本黨領導之下，而一致努力。」這二個令人感奮的文件不僅表明了國共二黨合作的決心，更鞏固了國內團結禦侮的基礎。次年四月月十三日，二十一日國家社會黨與中國青年黨亦先後致書委員長，捐棄成見共赴國難，同時危害民國緊爭治罪法既經取消，民眾抗日運動在公開合法的情況下普遍展開，對於初期抗戰的士氣是極大鼓舞。八年來我國空軍　　光榮的戰蹟　　年度　出擊次數　出擊次數　空軍人員　　廿六六　五八　三九六　一三五三　　廿七年　五九　六四五　一三九三　　廿十八　二二　三二二　一四七三　　廿九年　二三　二九九　一七二〇　　卅年　五一　三四八　一八六五　　卅一年　二五　二三九　一八八三　　卅二年　一五六　八八三　一九七三　　卅三年　一三七七　八一四三　二三二二　　卅四年　二一二六　七一〇〇　二三六一　　注：「出擊機數」係指每機每次出擊之總和而積成者。　　本報資料室八年抗戰獲得了勝利的成果　　示圖：何應飲將軍發表日本受降實番詞　　（中央社攝）　　抗戰期間，美國以大批軍火，由艦船載運至我國，充實我前線的戰鬥力。（胡列民攝）抗戰的烈熖焚燬了日軍三個月亡華的毒綱　　我們是以弱國來對抗強國作戰，而且戰前由於國內國外的羈絆約束未能從事戰爭的準備，無論武器戰術戰略都不能與敵人相比擬，因而在第一期的戰爭中我們處處處於劣勢，必須以重大的犧牲陰遏敵人的進展，然後以廣大的空間來爭取時間，一面抵抗，一面準備，一面作戰，一面訓練。　　尤其是華北形勢最懸殊，日本侵吞中國既早具決心，於佔領東北四省以後，就一方面制造冀東特殊政權，一面以威脅利誘阻撓華北國防建設，離間華北與中央的聯係，分化華北各將領間之感情，所以當蘆溝橋事變發生之際，華北實際上是在半解除武裝的狀態，平津門戶洞開，二十八日宋哲元一面下令總攻，一面就不得不向保定撤退，北平天津三日之間就淪陷幫手。　　平津既失，戰事擴大，敵人從北寗路，平古大道與塘沽海口三路增兵，同時展開平漢，津浦，平綏三路攻勢，而主力實在北路沿平綏綫犯南口。　　南口是察綏晋三省的門戶，在華北軍略上佔有重要地位，所以敵人於取得平津以後馬上以精稅的坂垣師團犯南口，使我軍佈置頗有措手不及之勢，三十一日二三軍湯恩伯奉命搶防南口，兵力雖然薄弱，但是都以決死精神奮命死守，血戰二十日，敵人屢攻不下，乃偷襲我軍右冀出長城迂迥懷來形成包圍之勢，而湯軍固守似舊。　　然而堅守二十日的南口，卻總以察北戰事的激變。（劉汝明貽誤我機失據張北，致張家口於二十五日陷敵，）張家口失守而處於孤軍深懸的不利情勢，不得已退守居庸關。　　張家口南口失陷之後，敵人更向西進襲山西，進攻天鎮陽高以取大同，由於李服膺的抗令不戰，使敵人得以迅速地完成這一綫重鎮的攻佔，九月十三日大同失守，敵人指兵南下，直逼雁門，（其時劉汝明又相繼放棄了陽隊，蔚縣，廣靈，靈邱，淶源，）雁門於二十七日棄守，與這同時，敵人另一支從陽進佔與興和，從大同之殺虎口進攻歸綏，並先後攻佔平地泉百靈廟與嘉卜寺，所以自從南口退守以來一個月之間，敵人幾乎以破竹之勢，造成了控制吾綏察三省的局面，其所遭遇之惟一堅強的抵抗與挫折就是九月二十六日的平型關戰後，是後我軍以游擊隊配合主國軍之運動戰，幾乎減了整個坂垣師團，造成西戰塲空前大捷，暫時穩定了晋北的局面。　　津浦路方面，日軍於八月三日攻取楊柳青，但因受南口戰事牽制沒有激劇的攻勢，華軍二冀反攻相當活躍，一直到九月初兩軍仍相持於唐官屯以北。九月四日以後敵人乃以飛機重砲發動猛烈攻勢，於十一日攻下馬廠，十七日攻下興濟，華軍二冀雖然活躍，終於阻不住敵人正面攻勢，於二十四晶退出滄州，日軍乃長驅進犯德州。　　津浦，平綏兩路的潰退影響平漢綫的我軍的攻勢甚大，先我軍退出平津以後，集中良鄕隊縣，憑琉璃河固守，二冀游擊出入於房山長辛店之間，阻擊敵軍主力南下，一直到九月十三我軍還曾泅渡琉璃河，和日軍激戰，然而其時南口既失，大同亦且攻下，津浦日軍亦已迫近滄州，平漢我軍兩面感受威脅，向日軍復發動二冀包圍，左冀攻佔固安永清，右冀攻取房山，我正面守軍乃不得不自涿州撤退，二十四日保定亦陷敵手。　　這以後日軍在華北山西還有相當長驅的進展、津浦路敵軍於十月五日陷德州，平漢路十月十二陷石家荘，再由正太路西出娘胎子關進迫太原，同時雁門湯明堡南下敵軍向原平忻口推進，造成原平忻口的激戰，忻口戰役我軍奮勇抗爭，血戰二十四日，郝夢麟軍長壯烈列國，而敵人亦受重大損失，十一月五日日軍佔領忻口，九日佔領太原。　　日軍於佔領太原之後，仍以主力沿同蒲路南下，直取風陵渡，同時沿太汾公路取汾陽，由和順取檢社，但是戰事的進展已呈相當膠著的形態，晋南我軍奉令入淮南渡黃河，在河谷丘陵地帶展開了持久的游擊戰爭。　　與華北軍事的長距離進展不同。淞滬戰事一開始就是一寸土地一寸血的陣地爭奪戰，從八一三到八二二的閘北滬東前哨戰，幾乎是一個巷街戰，其間包括突擊雁山碼頭的壯烈塲面，八二三敵軍在吳淞登陸戰綫外延，我國爲避免日艦大砲射程於九二三移向所謂第一防綫，北起瀏河，經羅店劉行，廟行，江灣，八字橋迄於北站，全長六七十公里，復與敵軍相持一月又十三日，終以大塲爲突破而動搖了全綫，閘北我撤至蘇州河以北，然謝晋元所部的八百壯士，猶堅守四行他庫，達四日之久，至十月三十日始奉命退入租界。　　長江失守以後我軍復在長江口至蘇州河沿綫佈防，敵人累犯而不得逞，十一月五日，敵軍在杭州灣登陸，浦東滬西後路被襲，不得已向西撤退，於是南市就成爲敵軍攻戰之最後目標，淞滬會戰已接於尾聲，十一月十一日我軍撤出南市，距八一三閘北開火，整整三個月，消耗敵軍，共計十餘萬人，這一戰役在戰略上也許是錯誤的，因爲它消耗了敵人卻更慘重地消耗了自己，而且始終未能爭得主動，以至牽動後方的新防綫，不過就整個攻略來講，淞滬三個月會戰，卻給了敵人以嚴重打擊，證明他們三個月亡華是一個迷夢，給予國人以深刻的鼓勵與教訓，證明我們能夠作戰，而戰爭本身卻是異常艱苦，而且必定是持久的。　　自大塲失守，南市撤退以後，我軍撤退所謂蘇嘉國防綫，北起滸浦口經蘇州嘉興南迄杭州海鹽，而日軍則一面猛轟海鹽，乍浦，一面狂炸蘇州，突破防綫，於十九日攻下蘇州。（我防務未固）戰事扒進到太湖沿岸的無錫和吳興，敵人企圖從京杭國道與京滬路二綫威脅南京，三十日日本海軍突破江陰封鎖綫，同時常州亦陷，造成京滬綫敵軍破竹之勢，十二月三日陷句容，王日四路進逼南京，日軍北渡長江取浦口揚州，十三日南京失守，十五日蕪湖當塗淪陷，十八日敵穩菁山市，二十三日杭州亦告失守，我軍退守錢塘江南岸。先十一月二十日，政府即已宣告中外，移駐重慶，從事長期抗戰。然而京滬線敵軍的迅速進展與南京杭州之相繼失陷都仍不免引起國內朝野人士的對政府的責難，與對戰局的悲觀動搖，所以　委員長於南京退出之日特發表宣言，謂中國持久抗戰，其最後決勝之中心，不但不在南京，抑且不在各大都市，而實寄於全國鄕村之廣大強固之民心。全國人心振奮，乃一面在軍事上重新部署，一面更加強團結，檢討政治軍事上之得失，經驗。二十七年一月韓復渠以玩忽軍令延誤軍事而處死，予抗戰軍民以極大感奮，三月廿九日國民黨臨時代表大會更重申精誠團結共赴國難的立塲，謂「非團結無以得抗戰必勝建國必成之把握，非共同努力於三民主義之實現，無以得真正之團結。」同時通過了搞戰建國綱領，確定外交，軍事，政治經濟，民運，教育的基本原則，由是全民全面的抗戰建國以至於勝利成功的道路更加明確而堅定。四月十二日，國民參政會組織條例公佈，雖然亦不過是一個謠訽的民意機關，但已經是中國政治上空前的進步。七月六日第一屆參政會在武漢成立集會，宣言擁護國民政府，擁護最高統帥，擁護抗戰建國綱領，抗戰到底，並通過籌設省縣參議會，發動民眾抗戰等等議案多件，同時民眾抗日運動也有蓬勃發展，兵役宣傳，公債勸募，獻金慰勞等等無不受到熱烈響應。而全國三民主義青年團也就在這個時期組織。八年來我國所受日本空襲之損失　　空襲次數　一二，一四四　　敵機架數（注）　二四，九四八　　投彈枚數　二一三，五六五　　傷亡人數共計　七六二，一八三　　死亡者　三三五，九三四　　受傷者　四二六，二四九　　生命估價（單位千元）　八五七，四九五　　注：民國廿六·廿七·廿八年敵機出動架數未明，故未列入。（上）抗戰初期廿五軍在北平效外巡選（中）全國軍民宣寵對日作戰（下）遷都後人民紛紛移主內地。（本報資料室）　　美國以物資接濟我國　　（圖示農婦領得免費麺粉的情形）　　響應我最高領袖的抗戰號召，上海市民舉行盛大的抗日大會。　　（本報資料室）　一篇清單　日本痛受了打擊我空軍榮獲勝利　　我國經八年來的抗戰，獲得了偉大的勝利，回憶抗戰初起的時候，中日軍力對比，相差甚巨；但我們兵力愈戰俞強，日本和則日趨薄弱。太平洋戰事發生以後，日本更須以大量之軍隊，應付美國，益感兵力不足，終於招致失敗的命運。相反地，在抗戰期間，我國軍隊源源不斷增加，戰鬥力日愈堅強。尤其在空軍方面，擴充得更快；所以日本受到了打擊也最深。看後列的統計，即可覘見我戰果之一斑。　　八年來我國空軍對日出擊：計攻擊三三三七次，偵察二〇次，空戰一五一次，掩護一五一次，降落傘兵四二次。共計三八九七次。　　日機在地面上爲我炸燬者五四四架，可能被炸燬者五架，受傷都一二〇架。日機在空中損燬者五六八六架，可能損燬者六十架，受傷者卅五架。　　日艦被擊沉者凡七〇三四艘。受傷者五四三艘。碼頭燬壞十六處。機車受炸燬者五三〇，損傷都九八。油車炸燬者四十輛，受傷者五輛。汽車炸燬者五〇一二輛，受傷者九二九輛。　　破壞知軍陣地五四八處，橋樑二九九座，無綫電台一九座。火車及汽車站九六處。　　日軍在空襲下官兵死亡者共三一四六六人，馬五五八一匹。對外爭取國際盟友　對內團結不容鬆懈　　讓我們回顧一下軍事以外的當時國內外情勢：　　那麼先說國際情勢，雖然在抗戰初起，領袖即會宣稱：我們爲民族生存而戰。亦爲世界和科正義而戰。因而肯定我們的抗戰一定是得多助的。然而在第一期戰事裏，我們所得到的亦不過是輿論的，道義的聲援，而沒有任何政治，軍事，經濟上的援助，相反的，我們還遭受略去義法西斯國家的侮蔑和凌辱。但是二十八年九月歐洲爆發，二十九年德，日，義同盟協定訂立，世界侵略與反侵略的陳綫日趨顯明。三十年六月廿二日德蘇交戰而十二月八日日本在南洋挑釁，英美對日宣戰，由是英美乃成爲我們並肩作戰的盟友。雖然英美主力始終側重在歐洲戰塲，但是在印緬我軍與英美軍隊共同作戰，擊潰敵人，開闢中印航空綫與史迪威公路，獲取國際物資的援助。不僅如此，美軍在我國內地建築空軍基地，增強了我們的空防與空軍力量，而且我們開始有美式裝備，美軍訓練的新式軍隊，這種種應該說是抗戰以來所未有的優勢，雖然因而也加重了我們的作戰任務，再就政治上說，我們的抗戰贏得了盟邦的尊敬，三十年美英先後廢棄對中國不平等條約，於三十二年重訂中美，中英新約。並先後簽字反侵略宣言，出席開羅會議，簽字波茨坦宣言等等確立了我們五強之一的地位。　　其次說到國內的情勢，那麼最令人痛心的事實，就是國內的團結隨著軍事穩定的，有利形勢而漸趨鬆懈。這一方面固然由於敵人漢奸的挑撥造謠，但主要的原因當是主觀上對團結的認識不清，努力不夠。先當抗戰建國綱領公佈之時，民眾抗日團體蓬勃生長。敵後民眾並組織抗日武力，發動游击戰爭，漸漸不是中央政府所能駕駛，於是在二十八九年之間就有多數團體被解散，同時各戰區改組政治部，統一指揮。軍事政治上常有摩擦的現象。及至三十年一月軍委會以新四軍抗令予以解散。　　就由於國際形勢的時時有利，與國內團結的日趨鬆懈，使得過去專以抗日的力量，得有觀望的機會，終至分成兩種相持的偶力，這不但使戰事曠日持久，徒增多少煎熬奪的時日，而且爲戰後建國佈下了荊棘業生的難關　　由於德國投降結束了歐洲戰塲，由於八月二日美國以原子彈轟炸廣島造成驚人的印象，由於八月八日蘇聯對日宣戰，由於我全國一致的堅忍苦戰，乃迫使日本於八月十日無條件投降，我們終於贏得了八年抗戰的最後勝利。在現在以至於今後，我們所要贏取的是和平建設，自然，我們在同時必須以全力來反對和平建設途中的一切阻礙力。　　茲因篇幅關係，本版本克將第二期抗戰史一次刊畢，俟相當機會，即行補刊，尚希讀者鑒原。（編者）星期論壇大赦之意義與範圍  郭衛　　國民政府今日將頒大赦令，蓋立法院前已決議通過大赦案，選此抗戰紀念之日，爲實施大郝之期，用意實至深也。自抗戰勝利，衡之舊例，當必有赦。涉於罪嫌者，期以此釋其甚慮，緊於監所者，期以此免於刑，當局已早計及矣。夫赦乃政策也，非沽恩示惠之具，舜典??災肆郝，爲萬世言郝罪者之始，蓋於不幸而罹罪者則肆而郝之，法外意也。考之唐慮三代之所謂郝，或以其情之可矜，或以其事之可疑，或以其在三省八議之列，然後赦之。良以所犯之罪或出於偶然過誤，或由於環境壓，迫非其本心固欲爲是事也，而適有如是之罪耳。非特不可入於常刑，雖流宥金贖，亦覺爲過，故救之以赦。此爲有意義之赦，按之現代刑事政策，適相胞合。蓋自二十世紀以來，言刑事政策者，已由一般預防主議進而爲特別預防主義。在特別預防主義，已舍鎮壓政策與威嚇主義而易爲有科學意義之改善主義矣。社會對於犯罪之觀念爲之大變，在昔國家與社會方而，對於犯罪，以期違反社會秩序，妨害共同生活，均認爲可惡之行爲，對於犯人乃惡之欲其死也。於被害者方面無論矣。向無從犯人方面而稍加顧念者，其結果嚴刑峻罰，甚至如隋文帝之盜一錢即棄市，漢武時代之法令如毛，一觸即死，卒致盜賊姦起，國亂民貧，幾喪其位，嚴刑之效可睹也。自採用特別預防主義後，始注意犯人之犯罪原因。人生誰非性善，何致以作奸犯科爲快，應探其原因之所在，而設法改善之，使之恢復其正常之生活，仍爲建設社會之一健全分子，是猶病者之患病，其情可憫，焉能以其病而棄之也。於是對於犯人乃改變其觀念，憐之欲其生矣。如於某種情事之下，處於不良之環境，非犯罪無以資其生，食生畏死，乃人之恒情，豈能責人人如夷齊而餓死於首陽呼？及環境既易，咸與維新，而與民更始，救濟之道厥惟大赦是賴，此大赦之有意義者也。　　三代以下，以赦爲恩典，故自漢以後，遂以赦爲常法。每於踐阼改元立后建儲之際行之，皆以示因爲名，突非大赦之本義。然按之實際，其間不能謂爲全無意義者。且於踐阼改元立後建儲之際，亦有不盡赦者：試就漢代言之，如高祖於五年十二月破楚，次年春正月以大戰已畢，大赦天下，迨二月甲午即帝位，不復赦，是踐阼未必皆赦也。至文帝即位而赦，爲已除諸呂之　亂也，昭帝即位而赦，爲已廢昌邑王之錯庸也。此雖赦於踐阼之時，實逢撥亂反正之會，不能謂爲無意義，因改元而赦者，自景帝後元始，武帝即位元赦，而改元赦，其後十改元而三赦。昭帝即位赦，改元又赦，其後二改元一無赦，宣成以次，或赦或不赦，或以兼人災異而赦，或以兼有祥瑞而赦，或大赦天下，或僅赦一地，無定例也。因立后而赦者，高惠文景皆未赦，武帝立衛氏始赦天下，謂爲與民更始，殊無謂也。因建儲而赦者，自高祖二年立太子始，其後偶有赦者，或因已降爵賞而不赦，亦無定例。此外因大喪而赦，如太上皇葬萬年，赦櫟園囚，高帝崩於長樂，發喪而大赦天下。惠帝因冠而赦，文帝因郊而赦，光武祀明堂而赦，行對禪而又赦。或因立廟巡狩而赦，或因定都徒宮而赦，非以爲常。在秦，自始皇併吞天下以至於亡，無大赦。二世雖因兵至國危而赦鄒山之徒，授之以兵，乃遇亂而用其人，與漢代之常赦有以異也。魏晋以還，其赦典之舉行，與漢略同，要其赦之所以爲名者多不正，殊不足師。清代常因萬壽而郝，則赦有定期，在赦之前已爲人民所預知，尤屬利少而弊多，應以爲戒也。　　至赦之範圍，按之三代亦菲全部赦免。呂刑對於五刑之疑有赦，五罰之疑亦有赦，刑宜赦從罰，罰宜赦則從免，是所赦者赦其有疑耳，非若後世不問有疑無疑而概赦免之。論語載仲弓爲李氏宰，問政，子曰，光有司，赦小過，舉賢才，朱子謂大者於事或有所害，不得不懲，小者赦之，則刑不濫，而人心悅矣。范氏曰，不赦小過，則下無全人矣。是或以疑而赦，或以輕而赦，而後世大赦之法，則不問情之淺深，罪之輕重，凡所犯在郝前，則殺人者不死，傷人者不刑，盜賊及作姦犯科者悉不詰，實非所宜。茲閱立法院此次所通過之大赦案，除應在赦令內敘明大赦之意旨外，並載明下列各項：（甲）犯罪在中華民國三十四年九月二日以前，其最重本刑爲有期徒刑以下之刑者均赦免之。（乙）戰爭犯罪及左列各款之罪均不赦免或减刑：（一）懲治漢奸條例第二條至條四條之罪。（二）懲治貪污條例第二條第三條第五條第八條之罪。（三）殺直系尊親屬之罪。（四）依禁煙禁毒治罪暫行條例科死刑或無期徒刑之罪。由是以觀，是採一部赦免之例，非採全部赦免之例也。一部赦免，並無背乎刑事政策。惟刑事政策上所認爲應赦免者，係以犯罪之原因爲主，非以犯罪之輕生爲衡，必其犯罪之行爲由於不良環境所促成者，始行赦免。例如因發生饑荒，而赦盜竊之犯，因風俗淫亂，而赦姦淫之犯，以其促成犯罪之原因非個人之意志所能抵抗，凡意志稍弱者，則易隕於犯行，非其本心有甚深之惡性，故時移勢易，倘獲赦免，予以自新之路，當能收洗心向善之效，無煩刑法之予以制裁也。此次赦免，旣以抗戰八載艱苦異常民不安生爲理由（見立法院決議案原文），不徒立言之正確入乎人情，而其意義之重大亦超乎往古。惟對於其中所不赦之漢奸罪，不無因生活壓迫而發生者，其犯意初不必皆有能謀敵國圖謀反抗本國之念。元惡大奸，固在不赦之列，參與敵僞特務工作以不利於抗戰者，亦絕無可原，但因謀生乏術而參加敵僞組織，以及純爲商業往來而無妨害抗戰之具體事實者，如爲情勢所迫，當在刑事政策上應予赦免之內。雖衡之懲治漢奸條例，此輩或不在應罰之列，而瓜田李下，終不能謂無嫌疑，難免捕風捉影，挾嫌誣訴，因事株連，動遭牽累，社會人情，每致不安。似應酌定檢舉期間，務於期內盡量檢舉，聞風逃避者，亦不妨登之簿籍，過期未被檢舉者，予以赦免，槪不追究。如是，雖輕犯偶有遺留，而元惡巨奸必不致綱漏，社會由此可免騷擾，建設亦由此易於進行，當亦無背乎大赦之意也歟？</p>

<p>電影戲劇精鋼與渣滓　「忠義之家」獻詞  吳永剛　　「這八年的抗戰，每一個中國人，像是經過了一次嚴格的考騐，猶則礦砂在洪　裏被煆煉，淸而上昇者爲精綱，濁而下沉者爲渣滓」　　這是「忠義之家」影片裏的總說明，本來人生祗有兩條路，一條是向下，一條是向上，像在煉鋼　裏被煆煉，留　有用的是精鋼，被廢棄的是無用的渣滓，誰願意做精鋼選是做渣滓，這在乎每一個人自己的選擇。　　「忠義之家」是寫在這八年裏上海人的故事，在這裏當然要很叫顯地指出那些人是精鋼，那些人是渣滓。　　上海人因爲是處身在不平等條約所造成的特殊環境裏，在多年的帝國主義壓迫底下，他們的愛國情緒特別地高，曾經在歷次的反帝運動當中，表現出無比的英勇，尤其是在「八一三」偉大的抗戰開始的時候，上海人所表現的英勇熱烈，應該在抗戰史上佔光榮的一頁，但是相反地，上海人當中也有許多像沉在臭水潭底下的洸滓，趁时時局的動盪，一下子就浮昇到水面上來，攪混了上海的一切。　　上海是我的第二故鄕，在後方的時候，心裏是多麼地眷戀着上海，從各方面的傳聞當中，應約曉得上海的一切，上海人是在漫漫的長夜裏等待着天明，卅三年的春天，吾妻　子出上海間道經溫州萬里來渝，從她們那裏又得悉很多上海的實况，這次徼倖能够提早回到上海，又從老母幼弟諸親好友那裏聽到了許多他們在身受的生活裏的一切，於是就奠定了我寫「忠義之家」的始願。　　「忠義之家」裏有上海人當中的精鋼也有應該被廢棄的渣滓，有每一個人可能接觸到的人物和生活，也許有許多地方我寫得不够眞切，不過這是我貢獻給全上海的父老兄弟姊妹們，我謹以至誠等候着你們嚴格的批評，布這裏我又要引用戲裏的一句對白。　　這八年的苦難換來的勝利，我們像在漫漫的長夜裏，走完了一條遙遠的路，放下了一付沉重的担子，可是爲了要建設一個未來的新中國，我們還得要負起更重的担子，踏上更遠的長途。上海話劇總評之五  管玉　　十二·「大地回春」　　　　這也是中電演出的，我們可以從這演出中看到中電的作風；他們在重慶劇壇上演出，一向保持有這種良好的作風，就是演員的集體創作代替個人發展的明星制度。這在我們劇壇上是需要的，該永遠保持的。　　在這劇中所能衡量到的藝術水準，並不下於「萬世師表」。導演者的處理方式是透過了技術的手法，以生活的行動來表現的。所以在舞台上看不到明顯的圖案和淺顯的層次，只能找得到深刻而有意義的　面和蘊藏的節奏。　　劇作者在這劇中只吿訴我們一句話：新中國是成長在毀滅中的。而這種成長是得靠人類堅强的意志和毅力才能完成的。否則，毁滅只是毁滅而已！但在現在這時期，這句話己經不適用了，所以「大地回春」的時期已經過去，應該把那句話改做：新中國是成長在和平中的了。　　中電劇團的三次演出，藝術和營業收到同樣成績的，就是「萬世師表」。藝術和營業同歸於盡的，就是「重慶二十四小時」。藝術水準高而營業水準低的。却是「大地回春」。一件藝術品的成功，不可拿營業的成績來衡量的。也就是營業的成功不一定就是藝術的成功。這全得看觀眾的水準來決定這一切。　　不從劇作，導演，演員和其他部門的任何單位做出發點，全從整個演出來決定這藝術品的成績；也就是說綜合各部門的力量共同完成一件藝術品以求其最高價値；那麽，在上海的劇壇上應該是「萬世師表」和「大地回春』胞劇了。　　十三·「昇官圖」　　　　這賣座五十天左右不衰的戲，因爲它的主題現實和演出方式新穎，更其是導演者深入淺出的手法，使觀衆容易瞭解這劇的意義和易於接受這劇的演出形式。因此，突破了最近話劇演出上座的記錄。　　劇作者曾爲了這劇的演出而寫着：「這劇本將要刺痛某一小部份人，但它是普遍存在的現實，誰得否認它，那是諱疾忌醫。」從這些句子中看來，劇作者是抓住了正在漫延的現實，不顧一切地把它搬上舞台的。可能爲了它的演出，這現象將絕跡於現實生活中。我們只要翻報紙來看一看，那一天沒有貪污之類的事情發生呢？敵偽時期的漢奸被捕後，說是地下工作者，並且還拿得出證件，這也許是金條的力量吧！有些漢奸仗了它的力量，一直逍遙在法外，過着優裕的生活。這些，正是「昇官圖」裏所諷刺的對象，也就是現民政治舞台上一羣貪官汚吏的寫照，這幫無恥的官僚們，仗着自己的權力，爲了自私的享受和個人的私肥，包庇着胆大作惡的罪犯，眞是可殺而不可赦！　　「昇官圖」的主題有着積極的意義，是個一針見血的作品；和戈戈理的「欽差大人」有同等的功効和作用。也正是現社會所需要的作品。　　導演者在這劇中所用的手法，完全是對襯的。在一開幕的時候，舞台上的道具，佈景，甚至燈光，都介紹出對襯的輪　來。這當然是誇大的，形式的，也正爲了它的誇大和形式，才使觀衆易於接特受和瞭解。　　在這劇裏，我們可以看出！導演者的平淡是一致的；佈景，服裝，化裝是一致的；演員的演技未能完全一致。醫如說：某人的誇大成份是一百分，而另一位只有五十分，因此感到誇大的成份不整齊，但是大致說來是完滿的。五彩歌舞片「封面女郞」之一幕，將在大光明獨家開映，主演者爲麗泰華絲美利堅的情人：　秀蘭鄧波兒  新方　　秀蘭鄧波兒有一口晰白的牙齒，一對亮晶晶的眼睛，五呎二吋高；棕紅的捲髮，她自五歲起踏上銀幕後，雖然已由一個跳跳蹦蹦的女孩變成了今天這樣一個美麗窈窕的少女，但是無論她的地位，聲譽，及演技，她依舊受着全世界觀衆的擁戴，從電影界方面言，她可以說是倖運的，不過她亦有她成功的條件呢！　　秀蘭鄧波兒生於一九二八年四月二十三日，今年才十八歲；最近剛從西湖女學畢業；約克與喬治是她二個哥哥的名字；戰爭期間一個服務於空軍一個服務於海軍，兄妹間很相愛；她在未結婚前合家住在勃雷和特公園旁，家庭間充滿歡樂；她和的翰喬治，阿迦軍曹（Sgt　John　George　Agar的相識可以說是很偶然的；有一次在安恩茄萊（AnnGallery她是名女　角柴　闢次的女兒）的宴會上見面後，倆人即一往情深；鄧波兒是一個愛幽靜，富幽默，重情感的姑娘；軍曹阿迦的年紀雖比她大六歲，但是與鄧波兒志趣相同，而辦事尤富精神；倆人的結褵在好萊塢是稱爲良耦佳配的。　　秀蘭鄧波兒在三歲時已被發現有唱歌及跳舞的天才，後經賈戈納（JayGonney）之提拔進二十世紀攝影塲至去年在哥倫比亞完成「賣吻記」，前後主演之影片已達二十九部，其累年收入的積蓄已使她成爲一個世界上最富有者，可是她對於國家的捐輸是決不在人之後的；最近她向記者發表在近幾年來她捐獻給國家的幾佔她收人項下的百份之六十，秀蘭鄧波兒眞不愧是一個愛國的藝人！　　秀蘭鄧波兒雖尚在荳蔻年華之時，可是她有崇高的理想；她最敬愛的是解放黑奴的林肯，她最大的希望是能够在阿拉斯加住一年，在她十八年中她認爲最可以留念的事是有一次羅斯福總統夫人請她在海德公國內叫　腸，她在暇餘喜歡廣覽　書，而尤其喜歡研究世界的時事。　　婚姻沒有阻止了秀蘭鄧波兒的前程，她在每一個月中可以收到三萬封世界各地影迷的來信，這個昔日以歌唱聞名全球的童星今日是以她的演技保持她的榮譽，在美國的各種雜誌上秀蘭鄧波兒是被稱爲美國最甜蜜，最和善，長美麗的少女，「美利堅的情人」是她的新別號，可是她非但是美利堅的情人，簡直是全世界的情人呀！舞臺技術講話  文泉　　（七）光色與染色的配合　　　　光色之混合，猶如算數相加，合色愈多，則愈增光輝而近於白。染色之混合，又猶算數相减，合色愈多，則吸收愈廣而近於黑。前會專題述及，此處不　。　　光色與光色之配合，和光色興染色的配合，有些地方雖然相同，如赤合黃爲橙，無論光與光色，染與染色，或光色與染色均相同。但黃光合靑光爲白色，黃光合靑色則成綠色矣！而無舞台佈景，服裝，道具又每與此發生密切之關係，若不詳知其差異，不但無法運用其神奇的變化，且往往能使全劇氣氛變換，喜劇無法喜，悲劇不可悲，反之，則呆笨的佈景能產生無窮的活力，正同愛匹亞（Abophe　Appla）說的：「燈光是舞台的靈魂」一樣。佈景接受了這種靈魂，便能强有力的支配產劇本中的中心意識，生龍活虎的興這意識生活起來，深深地印入觀衆的心底。　　（八）烏特（Wood）氏光色鳥特氏光綫，又名黑光，是一種紫外綫的，肉眼看不見的黑色燈光。它經過烏特氏的光板，照臨舞台上，可以使某幾項物質直接發射出燦爛奇幻的光彩。在歌舞劇中，它能給人一稱意外的效果。可以使普通佈景變成金壁輝煌，可以使普通綢衣。　有水晶寶石般的光亮。惜我們現在不能作更翔實的試騐，倒底某物作何改變，在某種極度之黑光下，又作何演變。　　烏特氏光，爲鳥特氏所發明。他製造一種塗染氧化鎳的光板，這光板能吸收全部光線，僅護一部份紫外線通過，這種通過的紫外線，便幾乎是肉眼肴不見的暗紫色的光芒，美國已經將這種鳥特氏光板變成一種燈泡，泡中除置一根水銀的弧形管，發射出紫外光線外，而於燈泡的玻璃中間，再藏含氧化焦的成份。這樣便完成了烏特氏的燈泡。可惜我國購不到這種特製燈泡，否則倒可作更進一步的試騐，給中國舞台色彩，甚至整個舞台藝術，闢一新的燦爛途徑。（續完）戲劇語言  陳默　　語言，在實生活中是表達人類情感心志，和思想的工具，而在文字作品裏，則是一切文學表現的武器，特別是戲劇語言，對戲劇藝術的成敗有決定的作用和功效！　　推源文藝的早期，詩歌是唯一的表現形式因在初民生活裏發洩情感最早的是詩歌；而戲劇語言在歷史的傳統上也完全是用詩的形式來寫的，決不是用散文。原因是詩歌比散文純潔，淸雅，又能達到過去悲劇的神聖，祟高與偉大！一般民間大衆也喜愛詩歌，接近詩歌，理解詩歌。所引人痛惜的，是當時一般文墨之士爲了要表示自己的淸高儒雅，雖用詩來寫作，但非　實語言；他們把民問最有力最純樸的東西揚棄了，撇開了，而用自己的智慧學識去矯揉造作一些自視高雅而實脫離大衆的作品！　　直到十七世紀前半期，法國大喜劇家莫里開始用散文來創作喜劇，國莎士比亞亦開始採用散文。莫里哀深切地感到喜劇是要捉住自然界所有的東西，而悲劇只不過要捉住，自然界裏最崇高的現象。又因時代的進步，社會的複雜，感到了詩的語言，詩的形式，詩的節奏不能與實生活一致，配合，調和着應用。而散文是最接近大衆的生活與語言，否則，單用詩是不够應用，不够眞實與生動的。　　莎士比亞的戲劇語言中，高貴的人物都採用詩句，低賤的人物都用散文，這樣，可以識別他們的身份。當時，莫里哀與莎士比亞都有同感，就是愈接近大衆，愈接近實生活的，都是散文而不是詩歌。　　十九世紀，挪咸大戲劇家易卜生在中年時，也感到散文的力量，自動取消用詩來寫作，到十九世紀中葉，現實主義抬頭，使整個用散文代替了詩來寫戲劇。　　這樣看來，用敵文寫戲劇可以說是時代的進步，戲劇的進步，社會的要求和人民的要求！　　詩是有格調的限制，而散文却是要從沒有格調中去找尋大衆而廣泛的生命的格調，戲劇語言的節奏應配合性格的節奏，最好的語言，是和性格，生活，情調相配合的節奏。　　戲劇的績構就是戲劇的靈魂，推進結構却要靠語言的力量。戲劇語言到了最高程度，除掉適合一切要求之外，還要能够表現人生的哲理。　　演技二分之一是動作，二分之一是語言，一個演員必須要在作品的語言裏去找，自然的節奏。特別在語言與語言之間空白的情感的聯　要抓着，握牢，控制，才能夠從語言裏邊傳出語言內含有的人物個性來。　　戲劇語言的生命，要以生活，性格，環境作爲有力的根據，否則，却要遭受決定性的失敗！會得史太林　金之蘇聯名　影師李德金及曾拍一萊蒙托夫」等國留蘇攝彩師陳郁蘭女士等由名作家葛一虹先生陪同於一日晚八時至中電二廠參觀陳鯉庭導演之「遙遠的愛」留影趙丹在「遙遠的愛」中琳特萊第談日女婦女  新影　　　　美國舞台紅伶琳特萊第，這次跟從參觀團赴日本各地遊覽，回到紐約之後，對於日本婦女，曾作批評，因她遊日之時，對日本婦女界之思想行動，特別注意。據她說：日本婦女的思想，有疾速進步，並立刻對於日本未來的命運，注意起來。她們要比日本的男子進步得多。並相信從此可得到解放，獲得眞正的自由　　譬如這次日本婦女界的參加選舉，比美國婦女選舉議員的人數增加三倍，便是一個例子。美國的婦女解放運動雖已成功了五十年，她們對於參政的興趣，反不及日本婦女！「人類的喜劇」啟示  陶熊　　　把幸福留給下一代　讓自已多受些苦難　　　　當我看完了「人類的喜劇」之後，我有一種說不出的煩惱。這煩惱是什麽？我自己無法把它很淸楚地寫出來。但我知道它是給「人類的喜劇一所引起的。　　我不能瞭解：人爲什麼生存？生存的目的又是什麼？難道真　我們所說的：」只爲了讓自己多吃些苦，把幸福留給下「代」嗎？或是：「爲了大多數貧苦人民的幸福，讓自己多受些苦難」嗎？這，是不是整個人類生存的目的呢？　　那麽，幸福和苦難的標準又是什麽吶？　　當我們的上一代，不是也爲了我們這一代。曾經受了不少的苦難給我們留下幸福的嗎？但我們的幸福呢？我們現在過着的生活，除了戰爭，　餓，寒冷和恐懼，還有什麽？我們沒有一絲幸福，所有的只是苦痛和眼淚！　　我們自己這一代呢？多少人在貪　枉法！多少人在囤積居奇！爲了自私才製造出許多不利人類的事情！更有些人是拋去了良心，只爲了得到主人所賞賜的一根骨頭，　使自己的雙手冒着血腥！這些都是人類生存的目的嗎？說起來是多麼的可恥啊！　　世界上整個的人類，除去小部份以外，都只抱了一個偉大的理想—爲下一代的人，撲減着法西斯。德國的命運雖然是完了，而希特勒的思想並未從整個人類的腦海中除去，尚有一小部份人的腦海中留有它的陰影，這，又將留給人們多少禍害啊！又如何對得起爲下一代死去的無數英雄呢？　　生存的本身就是一個够諷刺的喜劇了，還不能爲整個人類生存的幸福去奮鬥，是多麽的愚蠢啊！　　地球在宇宙中只是滄海之一粟，人又算得了什麼呢？　　每一個人活着是痛苦和寂寞的。他們用歡聚和　飲去欺騙自己的心靈，求得暫時的陶醉。當這一瞬那過去的時候，他們的心靈又惑到比前更寂寞，更孤獨！由此更痛苦和悲哀！　　人生是孤寂的！惟有懂得愛和能愛人的人，才不會感到寂寞！那麼，人生是多麽地需要愛啊！愛護整個的人類！　　被人愛的人是幸福的！能愛人的人是不會感到孤寂的！惟有那些陷於炮火之下的人和災區里的饑民，在被人遺忘着的時候是最痛苦，最不幸的！我們雖然並沒有處在那堅苦絕望的環境里，但是不能把他們放在自己的心里，是多麽的可恥！　　若是因爲上一代的人留給我們的只是痛苦，所以我們也不把幸福給下一代，那麽，人類將永遠是痛古和寂寞的！爲了人類已經不能愛人和被人愛，使整個的人類沒有愛了！人類沒有了愛，還成什麽人呢？人將不是人了！</p>

<p>春秋短篇短篇小說溫情的施捨  墨萸　　四年前的夏天，人們　伏在這變了色了的租界區域裏面，連細微的心　跳動都得仔細的記清住它的數目，以應付隨時隨地突然降臨身邊的那些苛刻而不容你思索的封鎖和檢查、一到晚上，小市民們都寗可鑽進那狭隘而窒息的屋子裏去忍受熱溫和蚊蚋的侵擾，因爲這樣纔能顯示出道地「良民」的身份而或許可以徼倖免掉了無安之災的威脅，「納凉」在他們已完全是一種遙遠的期待了。　　我所佔有了作爲棲身的道塊　隘而黑暗的亭子間，還是一個月前由C城趕到上海考進S大學後，向一個做了孤孀的老太婆手裏租來的。十九歲的女孩子能够毫無阻碍的畢業了高中，接着又順利地踏進了這號稱貴族學府的象牙塔；向上的慾望激發了我生命的飛揚，於是，放在前面的一個美好的夢使我變得勇敢，天眞，和活躍了。這些，在很短的時期內使我獲得了許多陌生同學的好感，同時也獲得了二房東老太婆的親切地愛護和照應。　　因爲早晨很早地我就乘了自行車到學校去，晚上又忙於第一學期許多繁複課程的整理，我漸漸好像把外間那些惡劣而可怕的事情遺忘了；同時因爲我和亭子間以外的世界是隔絕的，所以除了從黄昏時分嘈雜喧嚷的聲潮裏約略推測到這個弄堂並不怎樣單純和高贵以外，其餘什麼對我總是很陌生的。　　夏天亭子間的夜晚生活是最不容易排遣的，鬧熱的空間使我煩躁得連碰也不想碰一下那些長篇累牘的理論和定義；因此我常約B到亭子間来談天，B是和我科系相同的一位非常聰憑，英俊的男同學，學術上的切磋使我們性情非常融洽，性情的融洽更加深了我們的投契和往還，B常常偕了很多男同學到我這裏來，我們不顧形跡的縱談，狂笑，和高歌常驚動了夜晚弄堂裏的陰森和沉静。有一天，我打開了亭子間裏僅有的兩　窗，E頑皮地坐在窗台上用兩本書當着扇子在納凉，房間裏是左橫右仰，大家都　着不知名的曲子在翻弄着當天的報紙和雜誌，我斜倚在破沙發的把手上吹着口琴，房間裏一共有五個和我一樣洒落的傢伙。　　「弄党裏怎麼一片烏黑，連個足步聲也沒有」？E在窗台上向下張了張，忽然這麼對大家　　「每天這個時分總是這樣的」。我回答他。　　「眞見鬼！今年上海所有弄堂裏的電燈不知被什麼混賬東西拆光了，乘涼的人都沒法坐在外面吹到一點風！」E開始暴露出他球員的粗　風格來。　　「乘涼的不是因爲沒電燈纔縮到家裏去的啊，你們知道不知道？」A從床上拗起了身子說。　　「知道，知道，還下是爲了怕檢查麻煩！」H撅嘴說。　　「什麽檢查？簡直是吃豆腐！」E顯得不耐煩了：「警鈴一響，走在路上動也不准動，電燈都滅了，黑地裏無論男女，都要被他們亂摸一頓。」　　「還有哪！據說……」H突然停住了口，偷眼看我。　　我彷彿接受了一種模糊的啟示，羞澀地低下了頭，拿限梢看着B，B本來一直沉默地在看歌譜，現在他好像會意地立起來，朝着我說：　　「你用口琴伴奏，讓我們來合唱一隻！」　　「OK，」三條附和的喉嚨迸發出來，我擎起了口琴。　　「Gone　are　the　days……」E迫不及待的張開了他的粗綫條的男中音。　　「等一等！唱什麽？商量一下！」B攔住了他。　　「就是這個！」A和H也挺起了脚立得筆直地。　　　纔　　性的談話立刻轉換過來了，沉滯而　重的空氣一　時使粉幾個年青人的愉快心情　沒，流鍊雄厚的歌聲夾着我吹着的節拍開始瀰漫楊溢出來，它奸像代　我們幾個潔純的心靈向道時代，向這身週的　濁環境作一種申訴和悲鳴。　　「蹬蹬蹬……」忽然一陣急亂的足步聲從樓梯上傳來，接着門被粗暴地推開了，一個麻面的傢伙站到了我們的面前，我們的「演奏」於是戛然停止。　　「哇啦哇啦的什麽呀？你們不知道現在是戒嚴時期？」隨着道聲音我清　地大量了　麻面者的腔調，他穿一身黑香雲紗短衫裤，一雙黑皮鞋，再配上他那尊在電燈光下更覺黝黑崎嶇的面龐，一團黑的恐怖直襲上我們的心頭，我們相同地用着慨怒的沉默来答覆了這突然來臨的粗暴訪問者。　　「這房間是誰住的？」　　「是我住的。」我搶前一步立到他的對面，我更看消楚了在他後面還有三個裝束相同的人站着，手裏都擎着電筒，七八隻眼睛都非善意地注視着我身後的幾個同學，我企圖儘可能的用身子遮住了這一羣親綫，以避免他們或許給我這個伙伴的意外的災禍；我於是用了帶顫抖的口音來分散他們的注意：「你們來做什麽的！」　　「我要先間你是做什麽的？」　　「我是學生。」　　「那一個學堂？」　　「S大學。」　　「他們呢？」　　「都是我的同學。」　　「同學，男朋友吧！」他刻意經營地笑了，笑得那麼難看。這種卑鄙的調侃和剛纔那種嚴厲的氣氛又是多麼的不调和。不自然。　　「同學和朋友原是一樣。」B怕我受窘，代我申辯。　　「一樣？一樣到房間裏來了！他媽的，你們念的什麽書？」「拍」的一聲，B面頰上挨了一下：「半夜三更，哇啦哇啦唱的什麼東西？你們洋水喝得太多了。」這下流的口吻和這狂暴的舉動說明了我們今天的遭遇是無理可喻的了，我生平沒受過這種橫來的侮辱，我氣得倒在床上蒙着面大哭起來。　　「把居住證都拿出來！」麻面者並沒有注意我的哭泣，他那恐怖的手依舊一張張在檢對着BE…他們的照片，約摸有兩分鐘的沉寂，空間裏祇有我的哭聲。E用脚撥着我的身軀，他是反對我當着他們表現出我們年青人的懦弱的。　　大約這麻面者也找不出其他足以再侮　我們的資料，檢視後用電筒在我床下以及書桌裏面翻了一陣，又向立在他身後的一個矮得使我們相信他是東洋人的嘰咕嘰咕了幾句，他們就離開了這裏，我抬起了頭，他重又趨近我蜷伏着的身傍：　　「軋朋友我們是不禁止的，我也軋女朋友呢！」　　黑黝崎嶇的面龐上又是一陣陰險的笑。最後他悻悻地向B看了一眼，一窩風的下樓去了。　　第二天，我慢慢地向二房東探聽這種喜劇的究竟：我知道他兩個兒子都在內地，大的據說已經在今年參加什麽戰爭陣亡了，小的就在距上海沒多遠的鄉間工作，還時常托弄堂裏一個小學校的先生带信來，這弄堂住了將近三十多家人家，什麽職業都有，因爲這些原故，弄堂裏常會受到一種「突擊式」的檢查，據說這種騷擾就由於全弄裏份子太複雜的緣故；特別是那座小學校和我這二房東家裏，那麻面者常常很勤地带了幾個人來詢長問短，後來我纔知道這麻面者就是附近警局裏的什麼「特高」探長。　　從這時候起我常很敏感地覺到好像暗地裏有什麼人注意我們的行動似的，但是B和E他們，甚至其他的男女同學也還是仍舊時常到我這亭子間裏來談天，不過我們不大高興狂歌縱笑了，並且我們還留心時局的演變與上海的動態，拿來做我們談話的資料，我們都想在這資料中研討出一個比較妥當的應付這環境的方法來。　　夏天是一個苦悶而漫長的季節，　隘的亭子間，窒息的環境，使我時刻盼望着寒假的到來，囘到C城過一些清靜自在的日子。尤其是那麻皮探長還不時在夜晚間衝進來滋擾最使我難以忍受、但是幸好每次都有幾個男同學陪伴在我的身邊，我們都熟悉了於他那種無恥而貪婪的企圖了。　　學期考試還有兩個月要舉行了，秋天已經漸漸地深沉，過去不愉快的事情差不多快要隨着流汗消失了。我每天都在夜深趕着整理筆記，因爲我們第一學期的學分特別多，而且這些學分都是將來許多學科的重要基礎。　　一個深秋的晚上，許多同學都沒來看我，我被幾頁原理纏得頭痛，我倦怠的躺在床上，　　地聽到拜堂裏突起了一陣不平凡的騷動，雜亂的脚步聲中還夾着警車的喇叭這聲音像是在那麼小學校的門口，我邇猜測接着被一陣槍聲的方向證實了。　　「喂，我親眼看他進去的，怎會搜不着？」　　「先把弄堂封鎖了，按戶搜索！」　　「報告探長，祗有三個，兩個傷了腿，主犯在逃！」　　我這亭子間　原有的寗靜，以及我疲乏的倦意都被這從遠方傳來的雜沓的聲響　碎了；我下意識地省悟到這也許是同弄裏的盗　，我想着需要下去叮囑二房東太太把門閂緊，撐起了身子，披了一件睡农，頭髮經過剛纔在枕上的轉側，　亂得很厲害，我也顧不到這些了，一手拉開了房門。　　使我意外的吃驚的，我的房鬥外就立着一個穿着西裝的青年，臉色由於倉　的　子而泛出了　難看的灰白色，見我拉開了門，立刻竄進来替我把門關上，　擎地悄悄對我說：　　「小姐，不要怕！……我……被他們追急了，請你暫時，……暫時讓我……我避一避！」恐懼使他的聲音都發現了。　　「你是做……？」　　「我是幹……」　　「你搶了人家的……？」　　「不，我是幹愛國工作的。現在你不能詳細的……」　　他慌張地脱下了上裝，把腰間的一根手搶放進褲袋裏去，他好像非常熟悉我這房間裏的一切，更好像熟悉於我的行動，他已經漸漸鎭靜起來，面色也慢慢轉入正常，地開始以嚴肅地口吻命令我：　　「從現在起，你一切動作上應該把我當做一個同學．」　　「黄探長去十七號！」窗下有人在發着命令。　　十七號正是我這一幢房子啊！我看他在舒徐地梳頭髮，擦皮鞋，他好像已成了支配這房間的主人了，一股怨　的自私突地浮上了我的心頭，我爲將要來臨的恐怖激起了說話的勇氣：　　「你不能牽累到我……」　　「不准你有意見！你需要絕對的壓伏自私！」他旋轉了身子，把手放入褲袋裏，我知道他已經在做萬一犧牲的準備了，他已完全沒有剛纔那副可憐，慌急的神色，他好像把我當做了他的奴隸與助手。我爲這突來的事件怔呆了，麻痹。惶惑而至於　軟，我勉强斜倚在床上，眼睛失神地望着他，他悄悄地像是對部屬調話；「你應該愛你的國家，你是個受着高等教育的人；你要自私，祗有大家同歸於盡！」他更壓低了聲調：「你不要說話，請你對我暫時的拿出那平日待你的同學，朋友，甚至愛人的溫情來！」　　「對待愛人溫情倚？」我恐懼而又羞澀地看着他那修長的身軀，飄逸而又從容，溫文而有潛在的魄力。我迷惘地躺下丁，閉上眼睛。　　樓梯下面的脚步聲已到了我的房門口，他隨手拿起了一只口琴，站在　邊，門開了，先進來的仍是那一向滋擾我的麻皮，他那黑色的恐怖的姿態今天是更加逼人了，他拚命用眼睛打量我，我意識地看了一下我自己，一襲睡衣和一頭蓬鬢的亂髪。　　「哼！你們在幹的好事！」麻皮冷笑起來。　　我驚懼地看了這位臨時的朋友一眼，他面孔也漸漸地泛起死白，斜眇了我一眼，但我們都沉默的等着，等着一幕血的戰鬥的展開。他把手自然地又放入了褲袋裏，我不敢朝他們着，我聽見我脈　和心　快要奔出了軀壳。　　「你要知道，這是犯法的。……他是你的什麽人！」　　麻皮在我身上拍了一下像失去了知覺。　　「我們是同學！」他先開口了。　　「同學？哼！」麻皮不屑似地用鄙夷的語調轉向我：「你竟有這許多朋友？天纔黑哪！你們就　幹起來啦！」　　我細細地聽着麻皮的語氣，知道他是針對着我這睡衣和頭髮說的。我的心立刻　起了一陣輕鬆的平坦感，血的争鬥可以免掉了；但是我覺得自已少女的尊嚴無端地受到這樣污蔑，非向他辩解不可，我一抬頭看見他的手依舊放在　袋裏，這槍口也許在等着我的開口，我想起了他的警告，我又重複地恨恨的看了他一眼，他似乎也已經覺到了：　　「請你別誤會，我們實在是很純潔的朋友。」　　「純潔？……你看他這副樣子！」麻皮指了指我：「你們算不得有種，我軋姘頭總是明明白白告訴別人的，幹這種事既幹了就不要怕難爲情。」　　「哈哈哈……」麻皮後面的人都發狂地笑了。　　這一羣湧地出了房間，我吐的一聲哭了出來。　　「　污貨！這壳子每天是這樣的。」樓下又哄起笑聲。　　這亭子間重現出異樣的寗靜，我哭了整整十分鐘。這一幕羅曼諦克的短暫的悲喜劇使他回復了年青人的本能的溫柔，他扶起我，緊緊地握住我的雙手，「謝謝你，這偉大的溫情的施捨！」　　「不！你是偉大的。」　　「你需要點什麽？」　　「你的……姓名和地址。」　　「這……現在是不可能的。」他笑了。　　「將來我們也許會再見面的。」他穿上了上裝，鄉　地和我道了再會。　　秋夜，我懷着一顆寂寥而悵觸的心，步入了漫漫的傳奇之夢。我覺得寒假是太近了。　　卅五，六，廿四追記蘆溝橋之歌  墨農　　…爲勝利後第一個「七七」而作…　　我，在這八年以來，　　用自己的心，用自已的眼，　　在玉石的欄干上寫下盟誓，　　以欄干上的石獅子做我的忠實的見證者！　　我曾對我的夥伴們流出苦難的淚，　　說道：你去，你去，直立在你的崗位，　　一去而死掉也罷，好讓我們的屍身與屍身合抱，　　活着回來也罷，好讓我們的笑顏與笑顏相對！　　如今，我依然雄視着周圍，　　永定河的長流也依然在我的下方澎湃。　　我想像到我死了的戰友還在悄然呼吸，　　跟一切活着的以及將活着的一齊存在！　　我又目覩着，我又　傲着，　　玉石欄干的旁邊，和平的牛羊在徘徊，　　徘徊在古而常新的戰塲上——　　敵人的墳墓，我們勝利的搖籃！問  田羽　　你消沉在冬天里，說是待到春天會活躍起來的；然而現在夏已經到了，夏，是熱的季節，是年青蓬勃的季節，而你底心爲什麼仍是那麼憂傷的？　　是這時代苦悶了你？是這社會迫害了你？是你失去了愛人的心？是你失去了你的美貌？……不，這時代這社會只是把一大堆一大堆的污臭的渣滓推壓在苦難的人們背脊上，使他們窒息，使他們的肺被侵蝕腐爛，使他們在黑暗裏不安地死去，使他們把生命像骨頭似的抛給了貪吃的惡狗。——這一些，都該是你夢裏也沒有遭遇到的。你是富貴家的寵兒，　人者的　子，你是在苦難民衆頭上舞蹈的仙女，生長在溫柔之宮裏的鮮花。而正因爲這樣，在你底周圍無有了很多崇拜你，追求你，在你裙下看大腿，脚上嗅香味的「高尚」的美男子。你的一顰一笑都使他們陶醉，被他們歌頌，把他們的卑鄙的心魂完全獻給了你。你美貌，你年青，你有錢有勢，你有莫大的誘惑力。你是幸福的，你来到這世界上正像神仙到天國去遨遊，嘗不到爲生活掙扎的辛酸，受不到被魔手壓迫的苦難，你應該成爲快樂無比的孩子了，然而你爲何却是如此默默憂傷？　　你究竟爲了什麽？　　你常會感慨地說：「人是多末會老啊！哦……哦，天上的白雲，是如此的飄忽，就像這人生啦！這鮮紅的花兒，爲什麽插在瓶裏一會兒就謝了呢？這星星閃爍的夜空，使人看了是多麼可悲啊！但越是可悲，我就越是要看，寧願看了再去流淚！……你會爲着男朋友在舞場裏對你欠「熱烈」而回家傷心；你會爲着父親替你買錯了一件衣料說他不愛你而痛苦；你會在衣鏡面前日顯自憐；你會在鋼琴面前自彈自歎。甚至於，一隻驕養的小貓的死也　來了你的眼淚，一點無情的小事也值得你發聲悲憂，然而，在另一面，千萬人的飢饿引不起你些微的注意，你穿着雪白的高跟鞋，得得地走過乞丐路屍身旁，連正眼也不看一下。你責駡你的奴僕，發着暴風雨似的脾氣；你爲着享樂揮霍大量金錢，而還要訴說不够用。……一切，你所爲的一切，是不是都爲了自己的私慾？你憂鬱並不是因爲這時代賦予了你苦悶，而是你太沉溺於腐爛的生命裏；你悲哀，並不是因爲受了社會的迫害，而是無聊得發荒；你發脾氣，並不是這不平的世界激憤了你，而是沒有滿足你的私慾！　　啊，你這被培植在暖房裏而形將枯萎的鮮花，如果被移植在荒野的黑土上，是也不會再生長蓬勃起來的啊。我並不希望你「改悔」，不去憂傷，而去愛你的奢靡生活，永遠歡樂地過下去，因爲這至多不過是叫你去做一個歡樂宮裏的歡樂人罷了，與苦難的人們是無謂的；但同時，我也並不希望你把爲私已而憂傷轉向爲大衆而憂傷，因爲苦難的人們是絕不會被幸福的人們的憂傷的「同情」救起來的！　　你我並沒有做伙伴的份兒，雖然我們也握手談話，然而那中間的鸿溝是無法填平的啊！長篇連載雙宿雙飛　（七七）  趙清閣　　麗華自從和石玉樓長談以後，他更　解了自己的命運，也更爲自己的命運　　！有什麼辦法呢？石玉樓的話不錯，只有「閉着眼睛混！」　　石玉樓可以勸麗華閉着眼睛混，而地自已却不能閉着眼睛混！他需要吃飯；需要吸烟；但是他的病又不見好；生活一天天艱難起來；他不能常常讓墨太太帮助他；他究竟還是個有骨氣的。他把能賣錢的東西，都賣了；他差不多已到了山窮水盡的時候。沒辦法，他只好親自去和合作很久的　　經理商量，他要求容他依舊和麗華　洗壓軸，麗華也替他說情。但是經理不答應，經理的意思只能把他　在麗華的前面，包　每月兩百塊錢。這對于石玉樓自然是一個極大的侮辱。他和經理爭執，經理告訴他：不是經理不肯，是觀衆們不肯。如果經理一定給他擠了頭牌，觀衆們不來看襲，戲圈子便得虧本。所以經理不能不顧及生意。經理的理由是光　堂皇，石玉樓可受不了！後來又經麗華再三地向經理請求，經理才勉强承許了先非正式地試唱幾天，然後在確定。　　經理室談好了，但是胡琴又成了問題，如今張弦已經變成了麗華的私人羣　，他不肯再　石玉樓　了，他　詞說是伺候不過來兩個人。石玉樓明白大家都在瞧不起他了，於是一賭氣便改由別人　他　。頭兩天還馬馬虎虎，後來便不行了，一則中氣上不來，坐在前十排的觀衆都聽不見。二則胡琴　不到一起，常常不是他脫了板，便不是胡琴跟不上。這樣一來，觀衆又嘩然了，石玉樓再度『嗤』下了台！　　這一次石玉樓非常鎭靜，他不再牢騷，也不再生氣，只面紅耳赤地默默走出了戲園子，走　了公寓。這時他看見翁二太太還坐在燈底下洗衣服，他感慨地歎了一口氣。　　『怎麼這麼晚還洗？』石玉樓近來很少，這樣溫和地向翁二太大說話了。　　『　今晚上倒回來的早。』翁二太太說着，連忙站起來迎他，今晚上把衣服洗出來，明天可以去要一點錢花，公寓老闆又　繳房　了，你該累了吧？快躺下歇歇。』　　『噢，還好。你去幹你的活吧！不用管我。』石玉樓說罷　　地躺到床上。　　『還有烟不？我給你燒兩口，　　的臉色不太好！』翁二太大說，有點不放心地走到他的跟前。　　『還有。我不想吸，留着明天還　過癮。』石玉樓無精打采地說。　　『明天再　明天的，明天客人給了我洗衣服的錢，繳了房錢以外，還可以給你買二兩　子呢。』翁二太太安慰地說，一面點了烟燈，替他把烟燒好，　給了他。木工  謝梓文刻</p>

<p>自由談　　九年前的今日  少夫　　九年前的今天，我在東京，住在中野的一個日本人家裏。這個房東叫大堀良之助，他的太太在遞信省當一名小職員，女兒在女子師範讀書。　　照例十點鐘醒來，先翻看報紙，朝日新聞上的大字標題，大幅的蘆溝橋照片，令我不能像往昔一樣躺在蓆子上一頁一頁的讀了，我立刻爬起來，開了收音機，我所急於知道的是我們政府的態度——公開的表示，可是，得不到。　　我走出去找幾個朋友，研究一下局勢的發展？最後我甚至到麻布區的中國大使館，那時許世英先生已回國，楊雲竹先生代理館務，我並沒有會到他。滿街繼續不斷有賣號外報販的串鈴聲，心裏實在亂得很。　　中午，和一位姓江的同學在新宿車站附近的食堂裏吃飯，看上去，似乎每個日本人都用着敵視的眼光看我們。吃完飯，同去看大宅（壯一）和千葉（　雄），他們是我們學校裏的敎師，想聽聽他們有什麼見。他們的結諭，是：不會有戰爭的。　　並不是由於他們的話，也不是由於幾個朋友的意見，我個人回到住處來冷靜地思索了一下，據我在日本這一年來的觀察，日本目的祗在「華北經濟合作」，還是用的老方法。問題在我們的政府決心如何了。　　這一天，因此，我作了一個決定，如果政府有表示，再決定行止，否則，還是繼續我原定的計劃。於是，我關在屋子裏，加緊完成替朋友譯述的那件工作。直到八月十一日才離開東京。敲竹槓  楊謀　　　　上海人口裏的敲竹槓，是一句極平常的口頭禪。原本是，打打　，開開玩笑，不傷大雅的朋友之間互相敲敲竹槓，你要我請吃點心，我要你請看電影，也是非常普通的。　　不過，這敲竹槓運用到地痞土或者有特殊勢力人物的手裏，性質就嚴重了。一點把柄，一點小小的過失，加上了他們的恐嚇手段，就變成絕好的勒索的源泉了。　　敲竹槓的事情，也很有心悅誠服，爽爽快快的摸出錢來，或者即合心裏有一分疑　，但是無可奈何的自甘去鑚進這圈子裏去的。　　你的錶忽然停了，或者走得慢了，你也許會自己把錶後面的門打了開了，你看見的是東一個輪，西一個輪，無從捎手，也許自己也會用尖針之類去碰碰觸觸，但是，你搖了搖，看樣子，依然是老樣。沒有辦法，送它上　錶店去吧，鐘錶店的夥計眼睛上套上了放大鏡，好像很仔細的查了一查，聽了一聽聲音，把　旋旋了一下，再一抬頭：「二萬元。」不等你開口，他就　你接下去了：「天心壞了，換一個，油絲斷了，還要加油，咳咳，二萬元，最克已的價錢了。」你又不　，（本來，假使你懂了早就不上它的門了）沒辦法，除又付錢，又有什麽話可說？他又嚴重地拖上了一句，「隔二個禮拜來拿，」表示很仔細修理的樣子，其實，等你身子一旋，也許他在什麼地方一撥，這錶早就好了。　　你要配眼鏡麼，是的，也許你近視。也許你遠視，也許你的眼睛很健全，不過一上了眼鏡公司的門，他們不是極殷勤的替你騐光麼。是的，還是什麽科學騐光呢，但是你太相信了這「科學，」你也要吃虧的，這公司替你騐的光，到了旁公司這「科學」又走了樣，又是另一種光了。天花亂墜，結果還是要你擱錢。　　戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。　　硬敲　詐，這世界還不是這一套麽？　　手術也許有高下，因此有的「成則爲王」，有的「敗則爲寇」了。劇評之始  溪居　　　　報章評劇一事，今已盛行於中外各國。上海在七十年前，尚無影片流入，其時（光緒初年）滬埠民問娛樂，僅有京班戲及崑劇二種，丹桂茶園及天仙茶園演京班戲，三雅戲國則唱崑劇。名伶如孫春恒·杜蝶雲·孫菊仙·董月山，均爲丹桂台柱，三麻子。王海泉。左月春則在天仙茶園演唱，亦均爲一時之秀。　　申報初發刋時，除抄錄京報外，對於中外各地新聞，每日亦均有簡略報道。迨光緒初年，間亦刊載詩詞及論說。迄光緒二年丙子　五月初六（即一八七六年六月念七日）首次刋載劇評。題爲「名優演劇」。文云：　　「上海京班之戲，本己馳名海內，昨見「迎宋靈」一齣，乃武穆直搗黃龍府兀朮投降之事，爲中國吐氣而作也。命意旣新，扮演尤妙，其旗織之鮮明，士馬之雄壯，而爲二帝發喪，儀從赫然。有喇嘛僧，眞是塞外風景矣。岳王忠心耿耿，聲淚俱下。所吿四太子之言，義正詞嚴，深得大國之　，乃孫春恒所演，有聲有色，令人忠義之氣，勃勃而生，雖京中所未有也，可謂上海獨步。司其事者爲杜蝶雲，可見其一斑矣」。文末下署「樂老人書。」按：丹桂茶園其後蛻化成爲丹桂第一台。憶二十五年前，丹桂第一台尚為租界中區之最大京戲塲所，其時新舞台設於九畝地，至於共舞台，笑舞台，大舞台及黃金大戲院等，距今歷史尚短，一般老上海猶均能娓娓而談也。兒時可再  文漪譯自時代雜誌　　在美國南北戰爭後，一個老婦被她的子女送到精神病院，他們的理由是他們六十一歲的母親逐漸變得年靑了。由於院長詢問這老婦以往的歷史，才知道這六十一歲的老婦，在女孩時代非常嬌貴，以父母的地位與財產，使他很容易的大學畢業，而後嫁給了一個優秀的靑年。她的丈夫一直是非常溫柔的待她，什麼也不需要她費心。據她說，她連火車票都不會買，因爲她的丈夫總是先買了車票，把她帶上車廂的。他們的生活，很是美滿，有一女二子，但是不幸她丈夫在三十九歲時死去了。這使她非常悲痛，同時她覺得手足無措，因爲她丈夫遺留下的財產，都需要她的整理和分配，還要管理三個未成年的子女。她的財產雖然不多，但以她看來，己是一件極爲棘手的事了。她爲了使她的子女了解她能做他們的伴侶，於是在戴孝期滿後，便打扮得非常美麗，常常和她的子女們同在一起，交結些一年靑的女友，很多跟她的兒女去赴突會的時候，她的年齡在幾個月中變得年靑起來，常常穿了她的女兒的服飾去赴宴；自此之後，每隔幾個月便變得更年靑些。當她的子女發現她們母親反常的變態，便把她送進醫院。在她進院後，醫師們努力地研究她的退縮的原因；但終不能使她停止退縮，終於變得如同一個八九歲的女孩，在暇時喊着媽媽。她的子女們到醫院裏去探望她，不像是她的子女。相反地，她却像她子女們的小女兒了。因爲醫師們無法挽救她退縮的趨勢，終於她變成了嬰孩，不再行路了。她喜歡人抱着她，並且不時以大哭來消遣，完全回復了嬰孩的本性。在她年紀大約縮短到四五個月的時候，出了病院，因爲在那年不景氣的環境，捲去了她所有的財產。於是她被送入育嬰堂，她繼續的退化下去，直到後來竟成胎兒狀態了。一動也不動，只是很溫柔的呼吸着，到後來終於回到她的製造者那裏去了。盧家灣之仙  青建　　竟有這樣事！　　　　在上海的角落裏，有着這麼一堆怪物，半僧道的「仙人」配搭着自稱瞎眼的香伕，在替都市的居民免費治病。多少人蜂湧在向未連人影也難得見到的荒塲上，想除去肉體上的苦痛。　　那地方是在盧家溝電車站附近，祗要在下車時向賣票或香燭店夥友問一聲，就能得到十分正確的指示，走不了一千步，便到達仙人住居的所在。據說這長鬚飄飄的仙人，是從茅山來的，得道多年，已不吃烟火食，除了水果之外，人們從未見到他吃過什麽東西。這位道行高深的仙人，有一個香伕，專替來求醫的人們燃香點燭。他自稱從前是瞎子，經仙人治好，就跟隨着服役；因此也染着仙氣，如今也是不吃烟火食的半仙了。　　來求仙人治病的人不需要出任何費用，當然香燭元寶是免不了的。至於水果，即是隨緣樂助並不是必需品，但大部人是帶來的。除了農曆初一·十五以及星期日之外，仙人天天應診，時間大約自上午九時到十一時。　　說到仙人治病的方法與醫生大不相同，一般病勢較輕的祇需在點好香燭磕過頭之後站在一起，由仙人端出一盆自來水，在喃喃咒語之下灑向衆人。這樣每人多少挨到幾滴，仙法無邊，病體即能霍然而愈。許多善男信女，絡繹不絕的向人宜稱自己就是這樣的被仙人治愈數年或數十年的老毛病。至於病勢沉重的，仙人就把他們接進竹笆裏去，任意的念一通咒語，或者在病者身上亂換一通，順手在地上拾起一些水果皮—大多是桔皮—給病人吃下去，病勢就立刻滅輕。據說這仙法是百發百中，萬試萬靈的。　　有人曾經統計過，在每日求醫的一萬餘人中，以財富來分，則有十分之一是汽車階級，十分之五是三輪車階級，其餘爲平民。如以年齡來分，則有二分之一是美式配備的靑年男女二分之一爲老老小小的善男信女。假使這統計還準確的話，那末在仙人到上海已二月的今日，受仙人醫治的病人當在三十萬人左右。將這數目與本市公立醫院二月來的門診人數相比，恐怕能把外洋留學的醫學博士愧死！　　現在人們都在說是原子時代了，但在這時代裏堂堂中華民國的第一大都市上海，竟有着這樣的一齣怪劇，實在是不可思議的一件事！假使有一日這新聞傳到友邦，他們將生怎樣的感想？我想免不了要笑落下巴的！臺灣蝸牛  乃落　　　　台灣的蝸牛，大得像鵝蛋一樣，黃橙橙的背殼，常在陰暗的角落裏蠕動。據說這種蝸牛，先前台灣是沒有的，日本人從歐洲帶來，現在已繁殖很盛了。　　這裏的人，也有吃蝸牛的。煮法是將蝸牛烤乾，把殼內的涎水除去，再把殼敲碎，把蝸牛挖出來，切成一片一片的，加些糖和醬油，在鍋中煮熟了吃。據說其味和牛肉差不多，也可算得是異味了。如何從火窟中逃生  川虬　　告訴你一個常識　　　　最近大美晚報火災，有位先生因樓梯燒斷，從四樓跳下，幸虧時在白畫，下面有人相帮淸張開帆布，得以平安降落。但同時却有婦孺二名，無路逃生，終於葬身火窟。這類事情，在通都大邑，幾乎層出不窮。所以救火員常常說：「你能跑得出的，便是一座好房子」。或許可以再加上一句；「一位良好的家主，便是他知道在緊要關頭如何脫身」。　　這些話，並不是陳腐濫調。最近美國西部某城有二位十餘歲兒童，家中失火，這二人都焚斃在臥室門口。本來在他們二樓臥室之外，有一個走廊，下面是花園，很可以平安地跳下去，但他們在突如其來的恐怖之下，正和許多人在同一環境之下的行動一樣，就是開始向樓梯奔逃，結果便送了命。　　據統計所得，四分之三的住宅失火，引起的死亡，都是爲了樓下起火，焚斃在樓上。這理由很簡單，便是熱度上升，當火燒的時候，上面的熱空氣及燃燒的煤氣，往往達到八百至一千度的熱度，而且立刻佈滿了房屋的上層。人們從睡夢中醒來，從臥室急奔到外間，往往半途跌倒。在火焰眞正到達以前早吿死亡了。　　如果對大衆能灌輸一些兒常識，及稍加訓練，可以救無數的性命。假使你醒來嗅着烟火氣，切不可打開臥室的門。第一把手掌按在你頭上的門框，如果木頭已發熱，切不可再啓門，那已太晚了！熱的木頭，就是吿訴你，門外的房間，已給致命的熱度所控制，再也不容你使用樓梯了。　　因此，你應該讓門依舊緊閉着。如果可能的話，便從窗口跳出，或者至少從窗口大聲呼救。你旣然把房門和火隔離，你儘有生存的一切機會，直等到救護人員趕到。　　如果木頭不十分燙熱，不妨小心地打開看一下。此時應用腿部奮力支拄門緣，預備立刻可以關閉，然後輕輕開啓一二寸，倘有熱氣直撲過來，即須立刻關門，奔到窗口。　　在失火的房子最切要的機警動作，關門與啓門，同一重要。人們發見屋內失火，惶駭亂奔，把後面的門任其開着，以致積聚的熱氣及熏烟，可以自由向上流通，毫無阻碍。如果那間失火房間裏的門，立刻於奔出後緊緊閉住，那末火焰及熱氣，煤氣的前鋒，至少有數分鐘可以禁錮在裘面，而那座房子，也許可以保全　　曾有一位靑年主婦，在灶間生煤爐，加上些火油，以致蒸氣爆炸，火焰佈滿整個灶間。她一時手忙脚亂，驚慌失措。等到理智回復，第一記憶着她的孩子睡在樓上，趕忙奔出灶間，跑上樓梯，抱起小孩，開始向下面奔逃。這時，鄰居們已經用電話通知消防隊，，救火車立刻開到施救。但當他們走進屋內，發現母子二人，均死在樓上房間裏。檢查之下，斷定是給衝到上面去的熏烟所殺害，因爲她不曾隨手關閉住後面的門。　　救火員都承認許多的家主和子女，如果他們能知道和實習這簡單的開門和關門的常識，就不致於送命。新聞小天地官太太們有同感否  馮憶　　兩路材料處大舞弊案，經警務處處長多日偵查審訊，眞相已白，主犯是材料處長張鴻圖的太太郁香嚴，使我想起吳市長太太在一次集會上演說，內中說到一個做太太的儉樸，可以减少丈夫在職務上的貪　一句話來。這旬話出於市長太太之口，可謂深知一般富太太的心裏，而是有感而發。由此更想到有一些「公務員」太太平時作威作福，口頭上儘管嚷着先生做公務員待遇太菲薄，不够維持生活，但實際上都是揮霍無度，使人疑心他們是帶着家產來倒貼的。—現在，我們至少可以到得一部分的答案，這些揮霍無度的「公務員」太太們，原來不盡是帶着家產來倒貼的。我們極希望市長太太的話，能予一般女太太們以警惕和猛省！相信郁香嚴這類太太，在上海的慾海里，不過是偶然被發現的一個而已！　　最近一批兩種統債的投機者，在冒險家的樂園中失了風，終至證券號倒閉多家，更有多人身繫囹　，弄到身敗名裂。當初做「統債」的時候，滿想乘風作浪，　上一票，不料「統債」二字竟成　語，最後竟落得個「統」身是「債」！　　近日翻開報紙，新聞中獨多貪污，舞弊，鉅騙……等案，當我們抬頭看到國際飯店的禮義廉恥四個大字時，高高在上，成了一個强烈的對照。似乎亦是禮義廉恥離市民的距離太高了，所以對上海市民的感覺，僅僅帶來了嘲笑和諷刺！連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（五十七）  張樂平作　　社會服務　答復讀者　　法律質疑　　　申報老讀者沈省問編者先生：貴欄是人民的喉舌，社會的福星，謹上四點，仰祈露復爲禱。　　在抗戰的第三年夏，有僞保長某强令讀者遷出住宅，籍作僞聯保辦公處，斯時讀者迫於淫威。祗唯命是從，數年來忍氣吞聲，來由申訴，詎勝利後復遭同樣情形，謹陳積　，敬請示復。（一）抗戰期內敵僞人員佔住之民房，勝利後房主有無收回己用之繅利？（二）江蘇省保甲規程第三十二條之規定，保甲長之辦公處，應設於本人住宅，不得另設他處，未識上海市之保甲規程相同否？（三）如勝利後保甲長仍佔民房，是否觸法，房主能否請其交還？（四）請伊交還時應用何種方式爲適宜及合法？　　〔端木愷律師答〕（一）（三）·如能證明敵僞人員確係憑藉勢力佔住民房，自可請其交還。（二）·應向保甲處查詢。（四）·先用催吿程序，如無效果，則訴求裁判。　　（二）倪覺問：敝友殷小姐攻讀中學時，爲一外籍僞官員靑睞，百般追逐，不惜威逼利誘，敝友因年幼識淺，誤慕虛榮，結婚後始知乃夫家有前要，限於環境，未敢反抗，幷生小女孩一名，現股小姐因感前進黑暗，更受河東獅吼之痛，且與乃夫年齡懸殊，意呈請法院　異，請問（一）殷小姐因年方十九歲，尚未　法定成人年齡，欲起訴有無　格？（二）乃夫有引誘未成年小女及重婚之異否？（三）可否獨　向法院（因無父母）請求離婚及追　瞻養費？（四）小孩應歸誰方撫養？　　〔端木愷律師答〕（一）旣己結婚，有當事人能力。（二）有配偶而重爲婚姻，自構成刑法第二百三十七條之罪。（三）如有上開情形，得訴求離婚及賠償損害。（四）有約定者依約定，無約定者依裁判。　　王厚培問編者先生：（一）抗戰軍興，讀者即投　從戒，家父有田卅餘畝，淪陷期中，被人賤價收買，可否贖回？　　　（二）查東南日報（杭州版）二月八日載行政院保障征屬產權一節　　（三）附錄二月八日東南日報當代社訊一則祈參考：　　（當代社訊）行政院爲保障出征軍人家屬產權起見，曾經例會決定，凡征屬之產業，無論在陷區或後方，無論出賣或　讓，所有契約須經征人親自簽蓋，始能生效，否則如征人歸還後，仍可聲誚政府，以當時所售之價格聲請贖回，業經通飭各省市遵辦云　　〔端木愷律師答〕（一）如無被脅迫或詐欺情事，不得主張買賣契約無效。（二）東南日報係杭出版，反載稿件，未　代查。清除汚泥　工務局業經照辦　　「奉局交下」　　貴報移來讀者朱承文來函一件，以本局工人前在滬西疏濬陰溝時。將汚泥堆積於江蘇路中一邨弄口，請）迅予淸除等語，當即派工淸除，業於本月二十四日辦理完畢，相應復請。查照轉知爲荷。此致申報館上海市工務局溝渠工程處啓</p>

<h3>The Five-Person Talks Are Very Harmonious; Both Sides' Opinions Are Approaching; Partial Agreement Is Reached on the Issue of Administrative Authority in Communist Areas; Discussion Results Are Individually Reported</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The five-person talks temporarily formed by representatives of the government and the Chinese Communist Party held their third meeting at 4:00 PM today at No. 23 Baiziting, the residence of Foreign Minister Wang Shijie. Government representatives Wang Shijie, Chen Cheng, and Shao Lizi, and CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu all attended. It is reported that today's meeting not only continued to discuss the administrative authority issue after the withdrawal of communist troops from the main communist areas and from Harbin, Rehe, Northern Jiangsu, Jiaodong, and Northern Anhui, but also briefly touched on the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolutions, government reorganization, and the convening of the National Assembly. It is reported that as a result of today's discussions, the government representatives provided very detailed analyses of each issue and put forward relatively practical and concrete opinions. At the same time, the CCP representatives, regarding the government's consistent and serious stance in deciding to convene the National Assembly to demonstrate its commitment to implementing the PCC resolutions, the main purpose of which is to accelerate the completion of the work of unity and unification to realize national peace, no longer misunderstood it as they had before. Therefore, the opinions of both sides are closer than before. It is also reported that Chen Cheng will report on the day's meeting tonight to Chairman Chen. According to a certain person close to both sides' representatives, today's meeting achieved partial agreement on the issue of administrative authority in the communist-held areas. If further discussions yield results, the situation is expected to improve.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] It is learned that today's five-person talks discussed political issues related to military affairs, such as the administrative issues after the withdrawal of communist troops from Rehe and Northern Jiangsu. Although the details have not been released, judging from the tone of the representatives after the meeting and the relaxed demeanor of the representatives in recent weeks, it seems that today's meeting has achieved some success. Tonight, behind-the-scenes news faintly revealed that the issue of the communist troops' withdrawal from Rehe and Northern Jiangsu has the hope of being resolved first. It is also reported that the government continued to make concessions during today's meeting, so Zhou Enlai looked very happy after the meeting. However, according to neutral individuals close to both sides' representatives, the five-person talks have reached the stage of separate consultations, and it is believed that the two sides will conduct mutual discussions with Ambassador Ma tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The five-person talks began at 4:00 PM today, and Minister Wang left first at 6:10 PM due to other engagements. It is said that he went directly to the International Club at the invitation of the Norwegian Ambassador. When reporters inquired about the news, Wang replied with a smile: "The four people inside are still in talks, please wait a moment." After about ten minutes, Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu came out. Zhou greeted the reporters waiting at the door with a smile, and his hearty laughter could still be heard far outside the car after he boarded. Then Chen Cheng and Shao Lizi came out. Chen said: "The atmosphere of today's talks was very good." Shao said: "Today's talks were entirely about military administrative issues. The atmosphere was very good during the talks, but there were no concrete decisions to announce." As for when the five-person talks will be held again, Shao said that he was not aware of it, as the notices are all temporary. After the meeting, Chen and Shao had a nearly one-hour conversation at Chen's residence. Furthermore, it is said that the issue of the full administrative authority of the recovered areas was submitted for discussion during today's talks, and both sides are separately consulting with Chairman Chiang and Yan'an regarding the results.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Regarding the rumors that the government will be reorganized before September, Shao Lizi stated that it is too early to say, as the reorganization of the government is one of the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If the issues currently pending can be resolved smoothly, this matter can be implemented immediately, but it is not possible to determine the date at present.</p>
<h3>Belden Flew to Beiping Yesterday; Shenyang Group Discussed the Faku Issue; Changchun Branch Announced Continued Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] A certain military official stated: The conflict in the Northeast has not ended, especially in the Meihe area, where the communist army is attacking the national army. Belden, who is striving for a meeting between Du Yuming and Lin Biao, flew from Changchun to Beiping this afternoon to liaise with the Executive Headquarters. It is learned that the government side has approved the meeting between Du Yuming and Lin Biao, so the Du-Lin meeting can be realized. When reporters asked whether the rumor that Hu Zongnan would be in charge of military affairs in the Northeast was reliable, the spokesperson said that in his judgment, it was absolutely unreliable.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 6th] The 27th group of the Military Mediation Department in Shenyang held a meeting on the morning of the 5th. Huang Chenglie from the government side, Wang Shoudao from the CCP, and Raulman from the US side all attended to discuss the Faku issue. The communist side insisted that the national army entered Faku on the 8th, while the government side stated that it had garrisoned Faku on the 6th, and after the ceasefire order was issued, it immediately stopped its actions, and there was factual evidence to prove it.

<h3>Lin Biao's Remarks: CCP Demands Equal Troop Ratio in Northeast</h3>
<p>[United Press, Harbin, 5th] (Delayed) Lin Biao, Commander of the Northeast Communist Army, told a United Press reporter that the CCP has changed its previous ratio of five-to-one regarding the troop deployment issue in the Northeast and is now demanding an equal number of troops with the National Army. It is reported that this demand, as well as the issue of the communist army withdrawing from Harbin and handing over the maintenance of local order to the police, is currently being discussed in Nanjing. The communist army does not want to withdraw from Harbin, but is willing to review this issue. As for the government's request for the communist army to withdraw from major cities north of the Songhua River, such as Qiqihar, the CCP is unwilling to discuss it. Under no circumstances will the communist army want to abandon its defense area to a small area far from the railway lines. The CCP is very willing to develop the economy of the Northeast. The CCP welcomes Americans to the Northeast, just as it welcomes other countries. However, it has no intention of granting special rights to any country. He said that the CCP welcomes General Wedemeyer, the former US military commander in the China Theater, to return to China, and the CCP has a very good impression of him. When asked about the whereabouts of the commander of Changchun City and the Changchun City Defense, who were captured when the communist army captured Changchun, he only said that they were safe and sound and would be released after the government agrees to exchange them for CCP political prisoners in the future.</p>

<h3>Part of the Communist Army in the Henan-Hubei Border Area Moves Eastward to Attack Lihuang; The Vanguard Is 50 Li Away from Lihuang City</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] According to claims from the CCP side, the "situation is unclear" in Xuanhuadian, the base area of the Central Plains Communist Army, and it is said that the national army has strengthened its blockade of the southern section of the Ping-Han Railway, from Xinyang to Wushengguan Guangshui on the Guilin line, so the communist army can no longer move freely. However, according to military personnel who came here from Zhengzhou today, Li Xiannian, the communist army originally stationed in the Luoshan Guangshan Xuanhuadian area, has almost completely fled westward. His intention is obviously to destroy the southern route of Ping-Han, threaten Zheng-Han, and take the opportunity to coerce the people, plunder materials, and flee to the border area of Jiangsu and Shandong to join forces with Chen Yi's communist army in order to make a big move. If this plan fails, they will invade Xiangfan to the west and flee to central Hubei. The so-called "situation is unclear" in Xuanhuadian is nothing more than this.</p>

<h3>Receiving and Investigating Group Formed; Heads of Each Group Designated and About to Depart; Committee Members Remaining in Beijing Meet Yesterday to Discuss Progress</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Receiving and Handling Enemy and Puppet Material Investigation Group, composed of representatives from the National Political Council, the Central Supervisory Committee, and the Control Yuan, has recently formed 7 regions and 16 groups, which will soon begin work, and will depart in groups before the 20th of this month. The heads of each region are listed as follows: (1) Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region: Zhang Zhiben (2) Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Region: Qiu Ao (3) Guangdong and Guangxi Region: Undecided (4) Hebei, Chahar, Rehe, and Suiyuan Region: Li Sicong (5) Shandong and Henan Region: Guo Zhongwei (6) Fujian and Taiwan Region: Liu Wendao (7) Northeast Region: Qian Gonglai. The group has also established a joint office in Beijing, composed of three representatives from each of the three parties, and Mr. Shao Lizi is responsible. At the beginning of its work, it will first encourage people to report secrets, and then require the receiving agencies to submit original registers within a limited time, and then decide whether to conduct a full investigation or a partial spot check.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The committee members of the Receiving and Handling Enemy and Puppet Material Investigation Group in Beijing held a meeting this morning at the National Assembly Hall to discuss the progress of the investigation work. Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the Supervisory Committee, Secretary-General Li Chongbao of the Control Yuan, Secretary-General Di Ying of the Central Supervisory Committee, and committee members in Beijing such as Zhang Zhiben and Fan Yusui attended, and Secretary-General Jiang Menglin and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Chen of the Ministry of National Defense were invited to report on the process of handling the receiving work. Mr. Jiang pointed out the shortcomings in handling the receiving work at that time, stating that the various ministries and commissions of the central government separately sent personnel to various places to receive, and the local agencies also requested to participate in the receiving work. As a result, the authority was not unified and there was a lack of close contact, which led to malpractices. After the reports of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Chen, they both promised to provide as much material as possible for the future investigation work. Subsequently, the committee members successively expressed their opinions on the review of the receiving work in the past and the steps for the investigation group to proceed in the future. They all believed that there were many malpractices in the receiving work in the past, and the reason was that the responsibilities of the various departments for the receiving work were unclear, and there was no unified receiving organization. The various agencies only knew to dispute the acceptance and sealing of materials, which led to disputes between administrative agencies and military agencies, disputes between central agencies and local agencies, and the sealing of materials without utilization, resulting in mold and even theft of treasures. The committee members all believed that it was urgent to investigate the responsibility. As for the progress of the investigation work, most advocated first tracking down the original registers (i.e., the registers handed over by the Japanese), detailing the quantity of received materials, the amount of loss, and investigating the responsibility. However, it is reported that the previous original registers were originally scattered in the enemy's liaison management office, the Executive Yuan, and the Army Headquarters, and have been lost. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, the committee members suggested that if there is no original register, people should be encouraged to report secrets, and the method is either for people to secretly report to a joint office of an agency (the National Political Council, the Central Supervisory Committee, the Control Yuan) or to report to the local investigation group. Secretary-General Shao also suggested that for the receiving materials that cannot be used due to the Audit Law and have been spoiled, it is hoped that the committee members will discuss with the Audit Department to determine a flexible method, such as bidding or utilization. Furthermore, questions about the powers of the review group and the investigation technology were also discussed at today's meeting, and it was decided that when the groups return to Beijing after completing the investigation in the future, a plenary meeting should be convened to make a general review, and the government should be advised on its conclusions. It is learned that the group is scheduled to depart for various places to work before the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>Clearing the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank; Deposits Have Been Investigated; Non-Enemy/Puppet Funds Can Be Returned</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The "General Office for Clearing the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank" was established in Nanjing by the Ministry of Finance, with Director Bi Delin Wang Chi in charge of the clearing process. After four months, the various deposits of the Reserve Bank's various units concentrated in Nanjing (in addition to the Nanjing Main Branch, there are the Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Xuzhou, Suxian, Yangzhou, Wujin, Taixian and other seven branches) have been investigated. Apart from enemy/puppet deposits that will be dealt with separately, non-enemy/puppet deposits and bank drafts can be returned to protect the rights and interests of depositors. In addition, deposits in the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank in various regions and remittances are currently being investigated and will soon be announced and start to be returned. The procedures are as follows: (1) The pseudo-bank units returning deposits are the Nanjing Main Branch of the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, the Xuzhou Branch, the Suxian, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taixian, Changzhou, and six offices. The deposits of households in the five units of Bengbu, Anqing, Haizhou, Huaiyin, and Lianyungang should be announced and returned after centralized clearing. (2) The scope of deposit returns: (A) deposit reserve funds of financial institutions, (B) interbank deposits, (C) time deposits, (D) special time deposits, (E) current deposits, (F) bank drafts, and other six types. The aforementioned deposit reserve funds of financial institutions shall be applied for return only after government agencies have clarified that the bank or firm has not engaged in any rebellious activities and have proven that the debts of each bank or firm have been cleared up to 80%. As for interbank deposits, government agencies should also prove that they have not engaged in any rebellious activities before they can apply for return. If they have already obtained the proof of return of the aforementioned reserve funds, they can be exempted from obtaining proof again. (3) Each depositor (including bank draft holders) shall apply for the procedure by first obtaining an application form from this office, filling it out according to the format, and submitting it together with the original deposit book or check bank draft of the pseudo-bank (if the original seal is retained, the original seal must still be used) to the office for verification. The amount of the deposit returned shall be based on the records in the pseudo-bank's books. If there are any errors, they will be verified separately. If the deposit book or seal is lost, the loss shall be reported in the newspaper in accordance with bank practice. (4) Depositors who are far away in other counties and find it inconvenient to come to Nanjing to apply may issue a letter of authorization (if a seal is retained, the original seal should be used on the letter of authorization) to authorize a business or individual in Nanjing to apply on their behalf. If there is no one to authorize, they can directly contact the General Office by letter. (5) For the sake of prudence, the General Office requires each depositor to prepare a guarantee when withdrawing deposits, in addition to completing the application procedures. The depositor shall fill in the guarantee and send it to the office. However, if the documents are complete and there are no other doubts, the guarantee may be waived. (6) All deposits shall be paid in legal tender at the prescribed ratio. (7) The deadline for returning deposits is two months from today.</p>

<h3>Collection of Land Tax in Kind to Be Implemented Starting This Month; Collection Methods Are Specified</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The collection of land tax in kind will continue to be carried out separately starting this month. For land taxes that have been approved by the central government for various provinces, cities, and counties, and for land taxes that have been reported and revised, the principal and supplementary taxes will be collected together. Land tax will be collected in kind across the board. In special circumstances, local governments may submit a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to collect in national currency at local market prices. Cities and counties that have legally opened land taxes may also collect in kind in agricultural areas. However, the collection in kind is limited to rice or wheat, which are the main products of each place. If a place does not produce rice or wheat, the provincial or municipal government may request the approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food to collect miscellaneous taxes instead. The collection in kind shall be based on the tax amount recorded in the registers of various provinces, cities, and counties. It is stipulated that in rice-collecting areas, 4 shi dou of rice shall be collected for each yuan of tax, and in wheat-collecting areas, 2 shi dou and 8 sheng of wheat shall be collected for each yuan of tax. In places where land tax is collected in kind, grain may also be purchased or borrowed with the tax, based on the principle of being equal to the amount collected. A progressive method may also be adopted. In addition, approval may be obtained to collect public grain for provinces and counties, not exceeding 30% of the amount collected in kind. The tools for inspecting and accepting in kind may use the market stone and market dan as units of calculation. Collection shall be conducted once a year in principle, and shall be handled by the land tax management agencies of counties and cities. The land tax shall be collected from the land owners. If there is land that has been leased, the tax shall be collected from the lessees.</p>

<h3>Photographs of the Enshrinement of the National Father's Corpse Submitted by Traitor Chu's Wife to the Jiangsu High Court; Nanjing High Court Yesterday Tried Traitor Pan Yugui; Traitor Guo Xiufeng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, the Jiangsu High Court received a renewed petition from Chu's daughter, Meng Yuan, submitted by her mother, Chen Shunzhen, wife of traitor Chu Minyi, requesting the rejection of the appeal. It was a defense against the talks of Zou Lu and Bao Wenzhi of Xiehe Hospital. Attached to the petition was a book of photographs of the actual enshrinement of the corpse, with a total of 30 frames, all taken by the Japanese along the way; and a copy of the process of moving the remains written by traitor Chu, which stated that the corpse of the National Father was originally stored in bottle number 294 in the laboratory of Xiehe Hospital, and attached pathology medical tissue sections and wax blocks of the corpse. After being respectfully welcomed to Beijing, it was enshrined in front of the National Father's reclining statue in the mausoleum. The sections and wax blocks were preserved in the Bi Radium Sanatorium in Shanghai for Tang Yuhan to study the treatment of liver cancer for his reference, and were not recovered until the victory of the War of Resistance. The article also stated that the medicine used to soak the corpse must be replaced every two or three years to prevent decay. It was originally planned to replace it on last year's birthday, but it was not possible due to imprisonment. Please pay attention to it quickly, and so on. The last paragraph tried hard to exaggerate the merits of managing the mausoleum at that time, hoping to invite the government to grant an amnesty.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Capital High Court opened the trial of traitor Pan Yugui, the pseudo-Mayor of Tianjin, this afternoon. Traitor Pan is 64 years old, from Hubei Province, a candidate in the late Qing imperial exam, and studied in Japan. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau and other important positions. When the Japanese invaders occupied my former capital, Pan immediately came out to organize a maintenance society and served as the director of the Beijing Police Bureau, colluding with Japanese special agents and Yamashita Tomoyuki. He was then transferred to Tianjin as mayor. The people of Tianjin hated him for flattering the enemy, and he was known as "traitor Cao Cao" for his cunning and belligerent nature. Traitor Pan frankly admitted his past roles in pseudo-organizations, but he tried to deny his crimes in every way. Because the judge is still collecting evidence, the retrial is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on July 20. At the same time, the High Court also sentenced traitor Guo Xiufeng, the pseudo-director of the Central Telegraph Agency, to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] At 11:00 a.m. on the 5th, the Jiangsu High Court publicly tried traitor Xu Gui, the pseudo-Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Affairs Office. When the presiding judge signed the warrant for the eighth courtroom, traitor Xu was suffering from hemiplegia and was carried to the trial by bailiffs using rattan chairs. All the details of colluding with the enemy were excuses and attempts to shirk responsibility. He insisted that Ren Yuandao was meritorious in maintaining public security in Nanjing and Shanghai, and asked the government to revoke the wanted order. He himself was responsible for the public security in Jiangsu and could not be said to be without merit. He should be given amnesty according to the Ren example. The court hearing lasted for 40 minutes, and it was announced that the retrial would be rescheduled. Traitor Xu was imprisoned.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] Long Muxun, a cultural traitor from Nanjing, was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment by the Jiangsu High Court. Traitor Long was dissatisfied and applied for a retrial. He submitted a statement of reasons on the 6th, in which he defended many points of the original judgment, saying that he had flattered the rebels in writing and had served as a member of the pseudo-legislature. He considered the sentence too heavy and requested a reduction.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Magnificent Blood! Bitter Tears! Exhilarating Sweat!</h3>
<p>Today is a memorial day woven with blood, tears, and sweat for eight years by us Chinese people!</p>
<p>Today we encounter the ninth "July 7th," the "July 7th" after the victory of the War of Resistance, and we cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions. During the War of Resistance, the annual "July 7th" spurred us to shed blood and sweat to strive for victory; but today, the victory has been present for more than ten months, the fruits of victory seem to be moldy, and the future seems to be blurred again. What exactly is going on?</p>
<p>We know that today, all parts of the country are holding memorial meetings for the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, but I don't know what emotions everyone is holding when they mourn the martyrs? The martyrs shed magnificent blood and have been famous for generations, but today we only repay them with bitter tears, which is too much to say!</p>
<p>The martyrs shed blood and won the victory. We come to mourn them, only repaying them with tears, and we all become cowards who are not up to the task! The martyrdom and bloodshed of the martyrs has indeed fulfilled their historical mission of the War of Resistance, but the victory of the War of Resistance must be followed by the success of nation-building, and then the martyrs can rest in peace. We mourn the martyrs, we must shoulder the mission of "nation-building must be successful," and then we can be ashamed of ourselves, should we just shed tears? No, we should all sweat, shed exhilarating sweat, we must sweat for the revival of education, sweat for the restoration of transportation, sweat for the reorganization of the army, sweat for the revitalization of industry, and sweat for everything and everything for the construction of a new China. We must use the attitude of work competition, replace tears with sweat, and even replace blood with sweat, so that we can taste the fruits of victory. If we continue to mess around in the current situation, then the martyrs have already made contributions to us, and we are really ashamed of the martyrs; victory has not failed us, but we have failed victory.</p>
<p>On this memorial day, which is both bitter, magnificent, and exhilarating, we can't help but suppress our painful memories. When the Lugou Bridge cannons rang, the aggressive arrogance of the Japanese invaders was pressing. Our country was inferior to the enemy in everything, but with the wise leadership of the Supreme Commander, with the strategic planning of the General Headquarters, with the spirit of the national military and civilians rising up to resist the war and regarding death as home, we were able to find a way to survive in the long night of eight years with blood, tears, and sweat, and finally made the Japanese invaders surrender, unfolding an unprecedented glorious page in Chinese history. According to the report given by Mr. Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the total number of military and civilian casualties in the country is over ten million. This page of glorious history is really written by these millions of military and civilians with their blood. When we commemorate the "July 7th" War of Resistance, we must first sincerely mourn the millions of military and civilian martyrs, and even more repent; repent why we could not double our efforts in the middle of the ten months of victory to put the country on the road to construction, and even the common people after the disaster could not ask for a peaceful and happy life? Thinking of this, writing here, it is extremely bitter, tears and pen are together!</p>
<p>During the eight years, the Battle of Pingjin, the Battle of Songhu, the Battle of Taierzhuang, the Battle of Xuzhou, the Battle of Wuhan, the Battle of Changsha, the Battle of Yu-E, the Battle of Xiang-Gui, the Battle of Sui-Jin, the Battle of Dian-Mian, from the northern deserts to the southern Qiongya, the entire territory of China was half-ravaged, and the number of national military and civilians who lost their heads and shed blood is countless? When the Pacific War broke out, China was even more closely blockaded, foreign aid was almost cut off, and internal strength was gradually weakened, and the national fortune was as dangerous as a stack of eggs. But fortunately, the national military and civilians, except for a few traitors and scum, fell one after another and disregarded their lives, and finally broke through the difficulties and overcame the turbulent waves. Whenever there was a time of danger and shock, our leader often had a plan in mind, and the chance of winning was unique. The world changed in confusion, and the command was as stable as Mount Tai. The reason why China was able to turn danger into safety, turn defeat into victory, and the ancient country that had been weak for a hundred years could defeat the strong neighbor that had been reorganizing its army, was due to the spiritual appeal of the Supreme Commander, and later historians will have a fair conclusion. We have such a wise leader who has already saved the country from danger; we are even more convinced that he will be able to assess the world situation, target reality, and act with great benevolence and courage, leading China onto the road of democratic unity to lay the foundation for the country's permanent peace. I hope that all parties and factions and social elites can also have a great enlightenment, unite with one heart and one mind, no longer compete for territory, no longer possess armed forces, no longer destroy transportation, no longer treat human life as worthless, no longer obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, and no longer delay the formulation of the national constitution. Everyone should be selfless and work hard to build the country, then the military and civilians who died in the war will be able to close their eyes in peace.</p>
<p>China should be reborn in this War of Resistance! The power of the rebirth comes from one's own blood and sweat, and also from the assistance of the Allies. The Soviet Union issued it first, and the United States and Britain followed later. They not only gave spiritual encouragement, but also assisted in countless material strengths. Especially the United States, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, used the Lend-Lease Act to aid our military fire, train our troops, build the Lido Highway, open the Hump Route, and even send their children to fight side by side on the Chinese battlefield. And there are many volunteer warriors who, under the command of General Chennault, formed the famous Flying Tigers. The Chinese people will always remember these heroic and righteous acts of hating the enemy together. After the war ended, President Truman also decided to assist us in repatriating prisoners and overseas Chinese, and jointly controlling Japan to ensure that the enemy could no longer harm the world. At the same time, he firmly advocated military aid to China so that China could share the responsibility of maintaining peace. Marshal Marshall was even more tireless in running and mediating, hoping that China could achieve peaceful unification. The Chinese people have always emphasized good faith and harmony, and have the traditional spirit of repaying kindness with kindness. They are infinitely grateful to the allies who have shared the same difficulties, but when they look back at the status quo, they feel infinitely ashamed.</p>
<p>After today, we can no longer shed blood, and we don't have to shed tears in vain! We must sincerely repent before the spirits of the martyrs, summon up our courage, and everyone shed exhilarating juice, go to the countryside, go to the factory, go to the mine, go to the school, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, and embark on the road to nation-building! This is a meaningful commemoration of the "July 7th" woven with blood, tears, and sweat!</p>
<h3>Local Correspondences: Tragic Rural Scenes in Huzhou Area</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondence from Wuxing by Our Newspaper] Since my hometown of Huzhou was occupied by enemy bandits, the farmers' suffering has been indescribable. Without experiencing it firsthand, it is impossible to fully understand the extent of their plight. Someone from Anji recounted that the enemy bandits in Anji only withdrew after the victory. In the entire county town, only one house belonging to the Cai family remained intact. Although the enemy had built over a dozen barracks, the rest was just a field of rubble, a heartbreaking sight to behold. The county government is now located in one of the better houses within the barracks area, while the county party headquarters is housed in the only remaining house belonging to the Ji family. The people are impoverished and lack even the funds to build simple thatched huts. Over the years, the mulberry orchards they had planted have all been cut down for firewood, leaving them with no means to raise silkworms. In Meixi, a major town located about twenty li (about 6.2 miles) from the city, every shop in the small market was repeatedly set ablaze by the enemy, and all the towns were destroyed. Although the bamboo in the mountains could be sold, the soaring food prices and high wages make it impossible to afford the labor of cutting and selling it. The farmers are in immense pain but are still unable to secure the distribution of relief supplies.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Agricultural Loans for Middle Farmers Begin Disbursement</p>
<p>To aid impoverished farmers, the Farmers Bank of China has launched an emergency agricultural loan program in Kunshan, amounting to thirty million yuan. After more than a month of active preparations, everything is now in place. Starting from the sixth of this month, county government and farmers' association representatives, along with Farmer Bank's supervising loan officer, Yuan Zhicong, will personally go to the farmers' associations in various rural townships to disburse the loans on-site. It is estimated that this loan program will benefit 750 farming households.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Militia Officer Demands Goods and Detains Township Chiefs</p>
<p>Huang Dezhi, the deputy leader of the First District (Urban) Self-Defense Brigade in this county, ordered his orderly to summon the township chiefs of Pingzhi, Daicheng, Dongwu, Zhonglou, Minzhi, Shuangta, and Changhong to a teahouse meeting at the end of last month. Upon arrival, Deputy Leader Huang did not attend but instead had his men "relay" a demand for daily necessities such as washbasins, towels, and straw mats, instructing them to arrange it immediately. However, the township chiefs were unsure of the required quantities and did not know where to begin. Suddenly, around 11 p.m. that very night, Deputy Leader Huang led his armed men to the homes of the seven township chiefs, guarding the front and back doors as if arresting criminals. He forced the township chiefs to accompany him, demanding the items he had requested. When this failed, Deputy Leader Huang flew into a rage and detained the township chiefs in the open-air square of Sanyuanfang. Fortunately, the district head, Shen Tao, arrived upon hearing the news and secured their release. On the fourth, the seven township chiefs jointly filed a complaint with the County Provisional Council, recounting the incident. The council, appalled by the militia officer's outrageous behavior in the heart of the urban area, unanimously resolved to send a letter to the county government demanding Huang Dezhi's immediate dismissal and referral to the court for prosecution.</p>
<p>Changshu: County Government Reorganizes Security Forces</p>
<p>Hu Yanshui, the chief of the military affairs section of the county government, reorganized the existing two companies of the county security forces into two companies and one independent detachment to better suit the actual situation. Mu Jingbin has been appointed as the captain of the first company, Huang Huaide as the captain of the second company, and Zhao Shisheng as the commander of the independent detachment. They will be stationed in the city and countryside to carry out defense duties. Furthermore, all rural townships that have not yet organized self-defense forces have been ordered to establish them by the end of this month to strengthen defense work.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Fertilizer Loans of Two Hundred Million Yuan</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of the spring sowing loans, the Farmers Bank of China is now actively preparing for fertilizer loans in various regions, with a total loan amount of two hundred million yuan. The bank has dispatched Tang Kezhou, the director of agricultural loans, to Wuxi to collaborate with Liu Hanxun, an agricultural loan officer from the local branch. They departed on the fifth to conduct surveys in various townships. Starting today, local farmers can apply for loans at the Farmers Bank office in Buhang Lane. The interest rate will range from 3.5% to 4%, depending on the loan conditions, and repayment will be due after the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>Jintan: Cholera Rampant, Medical Supplies Lacking</p>
<p>Recently, cholera has been rampant in various districts, both urban and rural, in this county. In just a few days, it is estimated that there are over 500 cases. Due to the lack of medical supplies, more than 100 people have died. There are even shocking reports of entire families of four dying from the disease. Although a health clinic has been established, limited funding hinders the progress of epidemic prevention efforts. Only fifty bottles of preventive vaccine were recently received, a woefully insufficient amount for a county with a population of over 400,000. The epidemic continues to spread, plunging the entire county into a state of dark terror.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Businessman Commits Suicide with Rifle after Business Failure</p>
<p>Wang Puchen, a resident of the eighth household in the third Jia of the first Bao in Dongjizhen (Puxie Bridge), outside the East Gate, was 29 years old. He was married to Xu and had a son and a daughter, with another child on the way. He used to be in the cloth business, but suffered repeated losses amounting to over ten thousand yuan. After the establishment of the self-defense force, he served in the second squad and had a rifle with thirty rounds of ammunition. On the first of this month, after returning home from patrol, he suddenly contracted cholera. Despite treatment from both Chinese and Western doctors, his condition had not improved by the fourth. Puchen, distraught by his business failure, the onset of illness, and the heavy expenses incurred, with no stable assets at home, committed suicide in his room around 2 p.m. by firing the rifle under his chin. The bullet exited the top of his head, and brain matter and blood flowed all over the bed. His wife, Xu, and his brother, Xichen, rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound but found him already dead. The township chief, Gao Rongfang, reported the incident to the district government, which in turn reported it to the county. On the fifth, a judicial officer, Teng, went to examine the body, which was then claimed by the family for burial.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Relief Work Team Relocates to Wuxing</p>
<p>The Lake Second Work Team of the Zhejiang-Fujian Office of the General Relief Administration, stationed in Jiaxing, is relocating its office to Wuxing due to the severe disaster situation in the Huzhou area. This move will facilitate closer planning of relief efforts. The team's office location has been identified in Wuxing, and preparations are already complete. All staff members will be transferred to Wuxing on the fourth to conduct their work. In Jiaxing, Pan, the accounting section chief, and Xin Liangde, along with five other staff members, will be responsible for handling relief matters. The team's former address at the Catholic Church on Yangguan Street, outside the North Gate, will remain under the team's custody as a warehouse.</p>
<p>Jiashan: Refugees Beg for Enemy Grain Relief</p>
<p>There are currently tens of thousands of refugees from Xuyi, Jiashan, Dingyuan, Sixian, Fengyang, and Wuhe counties residing in this port. It has recently been reported that the enemy grain stored in the Shanghai Bank warehouse in Hexia Town, which had been approved for distribution by the Army Headquarters, has been put up for auction. There are rumors that it will soon be loaded onto trucks and transported away, causing widespread fear and panic among the refugees. In addition to submitting petitions to various levels of government, they have formed groups to petition the Ninth District Commissioner's Office, the county government, and the county council. They have also gone to the train station to beg for the loading to be stopped and for the grain to be distributed locally for relief.</p>
<p>Dangtu: "July 7th" Memorial Meeting Held</p>
<p>On July 1st, the county government and the Party Headquarters convened various county agencies to prepare for the "July 7th" Memorial Meeting. It has been decided to establish four groups: general affairs, propaganda, consolation, and disciplinary. They will begin working immediately. It has also been decided that at noon on that day, the alarm bells will ring for three minutes to remind the public of the hardships of the war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Issues Important Statement: China Should Be an Inviting Nation for Peace Conference; Soviet Representative Holds Sole Dissenting Opinion, Clearly Violating Moscow Agreement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the upcoming Paris Peace Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie personally delivered the following statement to the French Ambassador this afternoon, asking him to convey it to the French government, as France is the host country of the conference: "According to the Moscow Agreement of October 24, 1945, which the Chinese government has previously accepted, the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland should be drafted by the representatives of the foreign ministers of the four powers: Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The peace conference to discuss these draft treaties should be composed of the five countries: China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. If the foreign ministers' conference is based on this premise, the upcoming conference in Paris should naturally be attended by all member states of the 'Foreign Ministers' Conference,' and should not be limited to the four countries: Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. This is self-evident. Otherwise, the Chinese government will consider it a violation of the aforementioned agreement."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 6th (Broadcast). Bevin met with Qian Tai, the Chinese Ambassador to France, today to discuss China's participation in the peace conference.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 6th (Broadcast): The Foreign Ministers' Council of the Four Powers reopened this afternoon to attempt to reach an agreement regarding the invitation of various countries to attend the peace conference. The Deputy Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers held a meeting this morning to consider the distribution of invitations and whether to attach a draft agenda. It was originally planned to submit the report to the four directors this afternoon, but according to reliable reports, they did not reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 6th (Broadcast): Today, the Soviet government officially announced that the main issues of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' meeting have been resolved, and said that peace-loving people will surely feel gratified by this achievement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers met for over three and a half hours today to discuss the method of inviting the twenty-one nations to the peace conference and the procedural laws of the conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted that China should not be an inviting nation of the peace conference, but only an invited nation. US Secretary of State Byrnes strongly refuted this, believing that it was completely wrong and unnecessary, and amounted to insulting China. British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed several suggestions in order for the Four Powers to reach an agreement on the method of invitation. Regarding the procedural laws of the conference, Molotov did not indicate whether he would insist that the procedural laws suggested by the Four Powers should be binding on the other countries participating in the conference, but Byrnes stated that he would never forcibly impose the procedural laws proposed by the Four Powers on the conference. The suggestions of the Four Powers might be helpful, but the conference should have the freedom to formulate its own rules. It is reported that the Deputy Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers have already submitted a preliminary proposal for the procedural laws of the conference, the content of which is similar to the procedural laws of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. It advocates the establishment of a committee for each peace treaty, with the countries that have fought against the enemy country as members.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, in a state of weary fatigue, went to the Luxembourg Palace tonight to continue their meeting. The discussion focused solely on the method of opening the twenty-one nation conference, and it is expected that several other minor issues will also be resolved simultaneously. Therefore, before the Foreign Ministers' conference is extended, only the German and Austrian issues remain to be discussed. Observers here believe that the opening of the peace conference is not far off, so there may not be any progress on the complex German issue. When discussing the German issue, French Foreign Minister Bidault will surely demand that the Ruhr and Rhineland regions be separated from Germany, while US Secretary of State Byrnes will still put forward his treaty to control Germany for twenty-five years, and will call for a thorough investigation of the German issue in order to convene a special conference on Germany as soon as possible. Byrnes had also previously submitted a draft of the peace treaty with the countries, but the other three countries have not yet expressed their opinions. The most difficult issue in the Balkan peace treaty is the issue of free navigation on the Danube River. It is expected that the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers will soon reach several agreements.</p>
<h3>Italians Retreat from Tenda District: Territorial Loss is Extremely Significant</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Tenda-Briga district has been assigned to France by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers. The authorities in the district have begun preparations for the retreat today, and Italian workers at the Tenda railway and station have also been dismissed. It is also learned that the Italian authorities have requisitioned houses in Limone Piemonte, north of Tenda, so that refugees retreating from the district can find accommodation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 6th] The decision by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers to assign most of the Istrian Peninsula to Yugoslavia will cause Italy to lose an investment of 110 billion lira and 30% of Italy's coal production. The shipyards in Trieste and Fiume will also be lost. These shipyards can build 22 ships per year, accounting for 54% of Italy's shipbuilding production.</p>
<h3>Important Property of Germans in Austria Seized by Soviet Union; Severe Punishment for Concealing and Not Reporting</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Vienna, 6th] It was learned today that all important property of Germans in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria has been seized by the Soviet authorities. The news of the seizure was transmitted by TASS, which stated that according to the order of Gugur Mozov, the acting commander of the Soviet occupation forces in Austria, the former German property should belong to the Soviet Union. The Soviet military authorities stipulated that, according to the Potsdam Declaration, the Soviet government has the right to control the assets of German commercial companies within its territory. The order also issued a warning that those who conceal and do not report German property will be severely punished. At the same time, mayors and other government officials in Austria must report German property within their regions within ten days.</p>
<h3>Our Country Officially Recognizes Austrian Government</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 6th] According to an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, the Chinese government has recognized the Austrian government. The Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom has been instructed to contact the British government and request that it notify the Austrian government of this matter through the Austrian Ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Coastal Defense Vessels Must Undergo Inspection Upon Import</h3>
<p>Notification from the French Side to Our Consulate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 5th] The French military bureau in northern Vietnam, in order to prevent the secret import of contraband and weapons into Vietnam, has stipulated rules for the import of ships into Haiphong port. The rules were delivered to the Chinese Consulate in Haiphong, requesting the consulate to inform the various Chinese merchant ships and shipping companies.

<h3>British Fascists Bribed by the Devilish Mussolini: Reportedly Received US$240,000 Annually; Famous Writer H.G. Wells Writes Article Attacking Royal Family</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Famous writer H.G. Wells published an article today attacking the British Royal Family, saying that the former Mussolini government reportedly bribed the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley with a large sum of money before the war, and the Royal Family should publicly state whether they were involved. Wells's move is almost unprecedented. He said: If the British Royal Family is not without a relationship to this, then the Hanoverian Royal Family should flee the country with the Italian Savoy Royal Family, allowing Britain to return to its original republican tradition. The matter of Mussolini sending Mosley a large sum of money was recently raised in the House of Commons for discussion. Wells said: There are still people in the United States or other countries who drool at the sight of uniforms and palaces; they can build a "Royal Retirement Community" in their territory for the exiled monarchs of various countries. What is the inside story of this kind of large sum of money being manipulated behind the scenes? What is the relationship between the British Royal Family and this? The pure democratic societies of the world must know this. Regarding this matter, Interior Minister Ede read two letters from the former Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to Mussolini in the House of Commons on the 6th of last month, one of which mentioned that the Italian government sent Mosley a large sum of money in 1936. According to one report: Mosley received 241,612 US dollars from Italy each year, but Mosley flatly denied this. Mosley was arrested and imprisoned during the war. Wells did not explain how the British Royal Family was involved.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Most British people have not yet been able to read the article attacking the Royal Family written by the famous British writer H.G. Wells in the "Socialist Leader" weekly, because the weekly is currently only sold at a small number of newsstands, and the 20,000 subscribers will not receive it until tomorrow. London reporters commented: This is the most serious matter since Edward VIII's abdication. Wells's article is not in accordance with the traditional habits of the British press. The British press has never attacked the King and Queen. The British believe that this habit is very fair, because the King and Queen are constitutional monarchs and cannot respond to external attacks without government approval.</p>

<p>[US News Service, New York, 5th] US representative, Ebbes Teller, submitted a memorandum to the subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today, strongly arguing that the core of any atomic energy control system is the effective control of uranium and thorium and their radioactive derivatives worldwide. The memorandum details the US views previously presented by Baruch, the US representative to the Atomic Energy Commission. Baruch pointed out that the control and development of atomic energy must be international and should be entrusted to an agency that can be called the Atomic Development Management Office. The memorandum was drafted in response to questions raised by other representatives. The memorandum stated that any uranium or thorium falling into the hands of unauthorized persons is a threat to the entire control system, thereby endangering the maintenance of peace. The subcommittee will discuss the memorandum on Monday.</p>

<h3>Complex Political Situation in Indonesia; Sukarno Maintains Dictatorial Power; Anti-Government Conspiracy Foiled Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 5th] Indonesian Independent Government President Sukarno convened a meeting of political and military leaders yesterday. It is said that he intends to retain the dictatorial powers he recently acquired until the cabinet can resume its functions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 5th] Indonesian Information Minister Nasir announced in a broadcast from Yogyakarta tonight: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir's political enemies not only want to overthrow Sjahrir, but also want to overthrow Republic President Sukarno and replace him with Soviet-trained communist leader Maraga. The internal situation in Indonesia is extremely complex. It has now been found that the first Republic cabinet's Foreign Minister Subardjo was in contact with the Japanese, and Minister of Communications Abikoesno was a leader of the counter-revolution. Subardjo even wanted to seek US trusteeship of Indonesia if the conspiracy failed. This conspiracy existed as early as October last year. The actions in February this year were foiled by the authorities' counter-measures. They wanted to implement this conspiracy with the help of the military. People here now believe that Sukarno's retention of dictatorial power is to protect Sjahrir, so that he can suppress internal unrest and smoothly advance political affairs.</p>

<h3>Doihara Planned to Form an Autonomous Regime of Five Provinces in North China; Tanaka Continuously Confesses to Conspiracies and Secrets</h3>
<p>Trained 2.6 Million Soviet War Troops</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 6th] Today, the International Tribunal continued to try war criminals. Defendants Hiranuma and Okawa Jun did not attend due to illness. After the trial began, Tanaka Ryukichi continued to answer the questions of Prosecutor Sakaitoff. The expressions of the defendants involved suddenly became tense. General Itagaki listened attentively, Sato and Ken Ding leaned forward to look, seeming to hate his talkativeness, but unable to stop him from speaking, and showed a look of excitement. Colonel Hashimoto was busy taking notes for the purpose of defense.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 6th] Former Army Ministry Military Affairs Bureau Chief Tanaka Ryukichi continued to confess to the Japanese army's invasion of China conspiracy today, saying that Kenju once said, "Even if the incident occurs, the domestic situation may not support the Kwantung Army's actions. If the current cabinet opposes this move, the October 1931 incident will aim to overthrow the Japanese government to solve the Northeast incident. I strongly supported this matter." In 1943, he met Major Chō Isamu, who also said: "The incident was planned by the Kwantung Army. The Northeast problem became more dangerous due to the Nakamura Shintaro Captain incident and the Wanbaoshan incident, so we must take the opportunity to solve it thoroughly. Those who participated in the plan, the Kwantung Army was centered on Itagaki and Ishiwara, and the Japanese mainland was centered on me. He said that he completely adopted my opinions, and in the civilian sector, there was the Kawa Group supporting my opinions. The October incident was almost centered on me, but Lieutenant Colonel Ishiwara expressed his opposition. In order to drag the Army Central Department to support Manchuria's independence, we publicized that if we opposed the Kwantung Army's actions, the Kwantung Army would become independent. In fact, no one in the Kwantung Army had this idea." When talking about the opposition between the defendant Minami Jiro and Shidehara, he said: "In the autumn of 1935, Minami said to me: 'Because I made an active statement representing the army in the cabinet meeting, I often opposed Foreign Minister Shidehara, who had a negative attitude towards the Northeast problem.'"</p>
<p>Support Wu Peifu's Comeback</p>
<p>Continuing to talk about Tojo's power to rule the Northeast when he was the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, he said: Due to Tojo's plan, the Northeast's politics, economy, and national defense developed extremely rapidly. At that time, the important personnel of "Manchukuo" could not do anything without Tojo's consent. Next, he talked about the "Autonomous Regime of Five Provinces in North China," saying: The movement started in April 1935, aiming to establish a Mongolian autonomous regime and establish an autonomous regime in North China to remove the Mongolian area. It developed rapidly from the time the "Umezu-He Yingqin Agreement" was established in June 1935. The five provinces in North China were taken over by the North China Garrison Army, and the Mongolian area was taken over by the Kwantung Army, with the aim of completing the autonomy movement. In September 1935, Major General Doihara was ordered by Kwantung Army Commander Minami Jiro to go to North China to work hard on the autonomy movement. As far as I remember, Doihara hoped to support Wu Peifu to establish an autonomous government in the five provinces, but it was unsuccessful. Later, through Doihara's efforts, two regimes were established in Hebei and Chahar provinces in November 1935. The instigators of the above-mentioned autonomy movement were Cabinet Minister Commander of the Kwantung Army General Minami and Commander of the North China Garrison Army Lieutenant General Umezu. The purpose of sending Doihara to North China was to establish an autonomous regime in North China, so that it would have close relations with Japan and "Manchukuo," so that it would be useful for anti-communism. Although Umezu allowed his subordinate Chief of Staff Colonel Sakai Takashi to carry out the autonomy movement, it was a fact that he led the autonomous regime in his official capacity. According to Doihara's report to Minami Jiro: Although the Hebei and Chahar regimes were not satisfactory, they still met the Kwantung Army's expectations. Later, Hebei and Chahar will be used as the center to expand it. From the establishment of the Hebei and Chahar regimes to March of the following year, Doihara served as an advisor to the regime in Beiping, guiding its political and economic affairs according to Japan's wishes.</p>
<p>Mongolian Autonomous Government</p>
<p>Tanaka then went on to talk about his relationship with Prince De, saying: I once met Prince De, and the purpose was to make the Outer Mongolia Autonomous Committee have close ties with Japan. With Prince De as the center, an autonomous regime was established and he was assisted in establishing the independent country he hoped for. At first, Prince De expressed his unwillingness. Until August 1935, due to Minami Jiro's efforts, they finally signed a letter of cooperation, and the Kwantung Army also agreed to provide assistance in the future. This regime is different from "Manchukuo". It is Japan's support based on Prince De's wishes, and it is not arbitrarily controlled by Japan. Minami Jiro and Itagaki are both enthusiastic supporters of the "Mongolian Autonomous Government." Tojo had nothing to do with it at the time. However, after the Sino-Japanese Incident, Tojo's troops led troops into Inner Mongolia to establish the "Mongolian Autonomous Government." Finally, he made an important testimony on the Kwantung Army's training: "Manchukuo" carried out Soviet war training for national defense, and its hypothetical enemy was the Soviet Union. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, these troops were sent to the south. The number of Kwantung Army troops trained was about 2.56 million.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 6th] Tanaka confessed yesterday afternoon about the truth of the Northeast Incident, saying that the Northeast Incident was carried out according to plan and was not a sudden incident. The central figures in the plan were Chief of Staff of the General Staff Department Major General Tatekawa, Opportunity Hashimoto Lieutenant General, Chō Lieutenant General, and Dr. Okawa Shumei of the civilian sector. According to Chō and Hashimoto, the main planners of the Kwantung Army were Colonel Itagaki and Lieutenant Colonel Ishiwara. The purpose of the plan varies according to what Itagaki, Hashimoto, and Chō said. According to my subjective opinion, it was to open up the domestic situation and Sino-Japanese relations that were in a stalemate. To this end, we drove out the Northeast Chinese warlords, created a "Royal Way Paradise," implemented a "heuristic reform" in the Northeast, and made it a stable force in Asia.</p>
<p>Manchurian Incident Plan</p>
<p>Hashimoto once said, "The Manchurian Incident was planned by the Kwantung Army. I tried to correct the chaotic politics at the time and worked hard to support the Kwantung Army's actions. The October Incident was also planned with Major Chō for this purpose, but it failed. However, Manchuria's independence was successful. At first, I wanted to occupy Manchuria, but in order to avoid international friction, I thought it was appropriate to create a country. 'Manchukuo' was established as a result." Ichihashi once said: "Make Manchuria a base for the recovery of Asia." Only the Kwantung Army participated in the Northeast Incident, and its center was Itagaki and Ishiwara. Hashimoto himself worked hard to solve the Northeast problem before the Northeast Incident, and also planned the October Incident to innovate domestically. According to Major Chō: The October Incident was to assassinate politicians and establish a new government, so that the Japanese people would support the Northeast Incident. Dagawa was the chairman of the "South Manchurian Railway East Asia Economic Research Bureau" at the time. Hashimoto often talked to him about the Northeast problem and domestic innovation problems. Itagaki was the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army at the time of the incident. Hashimoto once said that he and Ishiwara were the central figures in the Kwantung Army. They said that if the cabinet's attitude towards the Northeast problem was very soft, if they opposed their policies, they would carry out riots in Tokyo, overthrow the government, and solve the Northeast problem in one fell swoop. Itagaki's opinion was that after Zhang Zuolin was bombed to death, Sino-Japanese relations quickly deteriorated, and diplomatic negotiations made it difficult to solve the Northeast problem. Therefore, he had to use force to solve the problem, drive out the Zhang Xueliang regime, create a paradise for the coexistence and co-prosperity of all ethnic groups, make Asian countries regard Japan as an ally, and get rid of the power of the white people.</p>
<p>Before and After the Seizure of Shenyang</p>
<p>Regarding the situation on September 18, according to Itagaki, at that time, according to the opinion of Nagata Tetsuzan, 20% camps were placed; at the time of the incident, one gun was used to bombard Beidaying, and one gun was used to bombard Shenyang City. The power was very great, and the Chinese army did not make any resistance. The progress was smooth. The artillery was secretly placed in the Shenyang Infantry Battalion, and the "South Manchurian Railway" tracks were within the range of the shell. Itagaki returned to China at the time of the incident, saying that "Manchukuo" had adopted the attitude that Japan hoped for. "Manchukuo" was ruled internally by the Kwantung Army, and the Kwantung Army guided its important personnel by its "General Affairs Department," but it had to obtain the consent of the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. Its important economic industries were all under the control of the Japanese government, and no political parties were allowed to be established except the "Kyowa Association." Regarding national defense, Japanese generals entered the "Manchukuo Army Government" as advisors and had close ties with the Kwantung Army. When Lieutenant General Tatekawa was the commander of the Himeji Division in 1934, he talked to him about the Northeast Incident. Tatekawa said: He had expected the incident for a long time. "On September 10. 6th. If the current cabinet receives a telegram from the Shenyang Consul General. It said that the Fushun Garrison Captain said that a major incident would occur within a week, so he strongly protested to Southern Minister of Army, Southern Minister of Army sent me as a special envoy to Shenyang to stop the incident. I arrived at Shenyang on the evening of the 18th, and the Kwantung Army, fearing that it would be controlled, refused to see anyone, so Lieutenant Colonel Hanatani, the assistant officer of the "Fengtian Special Service Agency," took me to the restaurant. The sound of artillery broke out in the evening, and the prostitutes trembled when they heard it. The Eastern Army knew I was here, so it didn't matter, but the prostitutes and others were still trembling. I slept soundly for one night, and Hanatani came to pick me up the next morning. At that time, the incident had already occurred, and my mission was not completed."</p>

<h3>Visiting the Atomic Bomb Test, American Congressmen Visit China, Wallace Speaks at Press Conference, Expressing Regret Over Certain Anti-American Actions</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] American Senators Elbert Thomas, Brewster, Butler, and Representatives Bell, Robinson, Brown, LeCompte, Miller, and Wallace, a group of nine, represented President Truman at the Philippine Independence Day celebrations. Except for Bell, the other eight arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Manila for sightseeing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, at the US Information Service, Senators Thomas, Brewster, Butler, Miller, and Wallace attended a press conference. The Congressmen expressed their excellent impressions of Shanghai and their gratitude for the warm reception.</p>
<p>Among them, Wallace, speaking from a personal standpoint, said: "Before I came to Shanghai, I had heard that some Chinese people had anti-American actions, which has now been confirmed. I do not know the reasons for this, but in any case, this situation should not exist. China and the United States were excellent allies during the war, and I hope this can continue in the future. I also hope that those who initiated these atrocities will not forget the three thousand American soldiers still missing in China, and will not forget the contributions the United States made to China and the world during the war."</p>
<p>Republican Brewster stated that this issue should not be taken too seriously. The United States also has two parties that oppose each other. Even Democrats themselves disagree on President Truman's policy implementation. However, both parties absolutely agree with the foreign policy of President Truman or the late President Roosevelt, and have great confidence in Marshal Marshall. The purpose of American troops stationed in China is to help China eliminate the crisis of war. As for the various external propaganda, I believe they are all exaggerated. The rumor that the US government is supplying the Chinese Nationalist Party with huge amounts of supplies is not true. Taking 1934 as an example, it was widely rumored that the US provided China with more than 7,000 tons of supplies, but in fact, it was only 4,000 tons. Therefore, I hope American journalists can help dispel rumors and hope that China and the United States can exchange personnel and visit each other in the future, not only benefiting both countries but also increasing understanding and jointly promoting world peace in both economic and construction areas.</p>
<p>Miller, who grew up in San Francisco, is particularly interested in China and said that they participated in the Philippine Independence Day celebrations. He feels that the United States has sympathized with the Filipino people for 46 years, helped the Philippines fight for freedom, and fulfilled its promise of independence. This shows the spirit of cooperation between the United States and Far Eastern countries in the future. Butler also said that although this is his first visit to China, he is not coming as a stranger. Although China and the United States are far apart, with the development of transportation, coming and going is not a problem. He hopes that China can develop transportation so that anyone can go to the United States.</p>
<p>On the way to the Far East, the congressmen visited the atomic bomb test and believed that although the test was not as successful as expected, the threat of atomic power cannot be denied. When they observed, they were ten miles away from the explosion site, so they could not make an accurate judgment. The height and size of the bomb were unknown. The second test will be on July 25, and further results are expected.</p>
<p>Thomas and others are scheduled to go to Beijing at 9:00 AM this morning to have lunch with Marshal Marshall and then fly to Beiping for a one-day and two-night stay before returning to the country via Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Northern Railway Station Epidemic Prevention Injections Reached 14,000 Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Head of the Egyptian Cotton Industry Inspection Team, Ma Hua, Speaks</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Egyptian Cotton Industry Inspection Team, a group of six, flew to Shanghai from Calcutta on the 3rd and stayed at the Cathay and Metropolitan Hotels. They have been visiting people in the textile industry to exchange opinions and have repeatedly discussed with the China Textile Corporation. The head of the team, Ma Huadi, met with reporters yesterday morning and first stated that he was not the Egyptian Minister of Finance but only a member of the Ministry of Finance. He then described the mission, saying that the purpose was to investigate the needs of China's cotton textile industry after the war and to assist its revitalization. Ma praised the excellence of his country's cotton varieties, saying that cotton is Egypt's most important agricultural product and the cornerstone of the Egyptian economy. Its output is almost 80% of the world's total output. He also said that the first batch of Egyptian cotton after the war arrived in Shanghai ten days ago. However, the discussions with the China Textile Corporation have not yet yielded results because Egyptian cotton is much more expensive than Indian and American cotton and is not suitable for the needs of China's textile industry due to its shorter fiber. The Egyptian Cotton Inspection Team also had discussions with the local Textile Industry Association yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to return to the country next Thursday.</p>

<h3>Taishan Rice Store Reported for Raising Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Taishan Rice Store on Henan Road was reported to the Huangpu Branch for serious crimes of violating the authorities' intentions and deliberately raising the black market price of rice. Yesterday morning, Director Du of the branch led Chief Zhou Guanghui to investigate. It was found that the rice store had a bamboo sign indicating the black market price of 660 yuan per liter. The shop's accountant, Jiang Wenxiang (29 years old) from Pinghu, was arrested along with the witnesses. However, according to Jiang Wenqing's confession, what he sold was "Winter Frost Rice," which was collected from Wuxi and cost 58,000 yuan per dan, plus water and transportation costs, so the cost was very high. It is now known that the police station has reported to the higher authorities for instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi's Indisposition, Caused by Cold Drinks, Resulting in Fainting</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Dr. Hu Shi felt unwell after having a cold drink a few days ago after arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he had severe diarrhea and fainted once. After being treated by a doctor, he gradually improved yesterday afternoon. According to the doctor, he will recover soon.</p>

However, Hu Shi did not attend due to illness. It is said that the cultural, educational, and press circles of the city intend to hold a tea party to welcome Hu Shi before he goes to Beijing after he recovers.</p>
<h3>The Sweetness of Sugar, The Untold Suffering</h3>
<p>Is it a "Monopoly?" Is it "Profiteering?" A Pound for 2,000 Yuan is Quite Frightening</p>
<p>[Our Own Special] The sweetness of sugar contains untold suffering. The 250 sugar shops and retailers in Shanghai that have joined the Sugar Industry Association are complaining about the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which currently controls the production and sales of sugar and monopolizes Taiwan's "Medium Sand," controlling the rise and fall of prices. They worry that if this continues, Shanghai sugar merchants will collapse.</p>
<p>The sugar merchants blame the Taiwan Sugar Company for "not selling goods," so that the market price of more than 60,000 yuan per dan before the company was established has now risen by more than 50% (yesterday's market was 100,400). The Taiwan Sugar Company attributes the price increase to the sugar merchants, saying that they are "profiteering, although it has not yet been clearly pointed out that there is bound to be speculation and hoarding."</p>
<p>This dispute quickly attracted the attention of all parties. It is said that Premier Song and Resource Committee Zeng and other responsible authorities met again last night to discuss reasonable ways to regulate production, transportation, and sales relations, and to lower sugar prices.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Corporation is a joint venture between the Resource Committee and the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office. The export of Taiwan sugar and its distribution and sales in Shanghai are the business of this state-run agency.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Corporation was established on May 1. At that time, it received 150,000 tons of "Medium Sand" and 90,000 tons of raw materials for manufacturing sugar from the "Taiwan Sugar Industry Takeover Committee," which originally managed the cooperative sugar. Due to the lack of transportation, they ship about 10,000 tons of sugar to Shanghai every month. This amount is actually sufficient for consumption.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of distribution of sugar in the country. The monthly sales volume is about 12,000 tons. The city consumes 30%, and about 70% is transported to other places such as Pingjin, Beijing, Hankou, and Suxi. China's sugar requirements mainly come from two sources: Java and Taiwan. Although the Philippines and Brazil also produce sugar, the former has to supply the United States, and the latter is too expensive to be sold to China. Even Taiwan sugar, before the war, was also unable to compete with Java's "Dutch sugar" because the price was 1 or 2 US cents higher per pound. However, the war destroyed most of Java's 125 sugar refineries. In the future, China's sugar consumption will depend entirely on Taiwan, and this Taiwan Sugar Corporation will become the sole master of all sugar consumers in China.</p>
<p>When the Taiwan Sugar Corporation opened on May 24, it sold the first batch of Taiwan grain to formal sugar merchants and consumer cooperatives that had applied, at a price of 66,000 yuan per ancestor (the market price at the time was 70,500 yuan), totaling 1,000 tons. After that, a batch was sold every week, and the quantity and the duty supply were not much different from before. Until the fourth period, the market price rose to 81,000 yuan, and the company's selling price also rose to 73,000. At this time, rumors arose that distribution would be stopped.</p>
<p>Very clearly, prices started to rise from the fourth period. On June 20, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation directly sold 300 tons on the market, and the price rose to 98,000 yuan. The next day, the market softened, thinking that the company would continue to sell to depress prices, but the price was still 98,000, and the quantity was reduced to 200 tons, so the market price returned again.</p>
<p>It is said that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation sets its selling price according to the market price, giving merchants a 99% discount per dan, removing two pounds of bag skin, and allowing a profit of 15%. The sugar merchants also seem to have difficulties. The black market discount interest rate is as high as 20%, plus the cost of the dock, etc. The current purchase price of the so-called "road goods" ordered from the company is 98,000 yuan, plus expenses, and sold for 100,400 yuan, no wonder they are complaining. Hoarders can certainly get huge profits, but the sugar merchants defend themselves and say: "Our working capital is not enough, how can we hoard large amounts?"</p>
<p>The sugar merchants also said: "The cost of Taiwan plus transportation costs is only about 50,000, but now it is sold for 100,000. Isn't the profit made by the company? We would rather the company set the price low and make less money." They frankly said: "Official institutions are not willing to gradually depress prices. We are merchants. Don't we want to seek profit from our capital?"</p>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Corporation attributes the lack of goods to the lack of ships and the reason for the market price increase, saying: "From the fourth period, the truth about the inventory was revealed, and the market raised prices together." Who raised whose price has been disputed until now.</p>
<p>Today's Taiwan Sugar Corporation and sugar merchants seem to be opposed to each other on the two cliffs of a deep valley, pointing fingers and glaring angrily. This one says: "You are profiteering!" That one says: "You are monopolizing!" - People who are eager for sweets are holding a confused heart and looking up at the sugar price of 2,000 yuan per pound with admiration. (Zhong Shi)</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Deported German Nationals, More Than 700 People Leave Shanghai Today, Schuster and Others are Expected to be Exempted from Deportation, Several People Who Did Not Report Have Been Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The first batch of German nationals to be deported from the city totals 738 people. Except for 12 people who did not report yesterday, all of them boarded the American warship "Robin" yesterday, preparing to leave Shanghai at 5:00 AM this morning. The list of evacuees also includes 57 people from Guangdong, Hankou, Beijing, and Jinan. Before leaving the concentration camp, customs personnel were responsible for checking them one by one, and the order was good. The authorities are stepping up their search for the 12 missing people. As of late last night, several people had been arrested. It is learned that among the German nationals who have boarded the ship, one child died a few days ago, the cause of death is unknown. It is rumored that several other children have also contracted whooping cough, which is likely to spread, but the patients have been isolated. Also, the list of evacuees includes Ernst Schuster and his wife, Em sLund and his wife, and Michael von Hasel. These people have been represented by American lawyer Errmann, who has applied to the local court for a subpoena to investigate if they are anti-Nazi in order to avoid deportation. It is said that Errmann has inquired with the US State and Army Departments in the name of these people, and both have proven that they are not related to the Nazi elements. Schuster has been traveling in China for 21 years. He once served as the general manager of Cosmos Paper Company. In 1937, Schuster applied for naturalization as an American citizen, but it failed due to the outbreak of the war. During the war in Shanghai, Schuster helped this newspaper transport hundreds of orders of newsprint in the Yangshupu area. Hasel has been identified by UNRRA as a political refugee during the Bush regime and is known for his anti-Nazi stance. Chiang Tingfu, Director of UNRRA, has also issued a letter to prove this.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Rice and Grain, The City is Divided into 32 Districts, The Price of White Rice is Set at 51,000 Per Stone</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Rice Shop Association held a joint meeting of directors, supervisors, and representatives of rice shops in various districts at the Rice Industry North Market at No. 212 Kulun Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 40 people attended, and the following resolutions were made: (1) In the future, the distribution of rice will be based on the 32 district units into which the city is divided, implementing a district distribution system. Each day, several districts of rice shops will be distributed to sell rice. All member rice shops in the districts on duty will have rice to sell on that day to avoid citizens running around looking for it. (2) The rice shops will be divided into two grades, A and B, according to the amount of sales in the past. Grade A will be allocated 20 stone per day, and Grade B will be allocated 13 stone. (3) The prices of the allocated rice sold by each rice shop must be uniform. The price of Yue rice and white rice is 51,000 yuan per stone, and the price of Gan rice is 47,000 yuan per stone. (4) Please ask the municipal government to set up a rice price review committee as soon as possible in order to encourage grain merchants to go to the production areas to purchase rice and sell it in Shanghai at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Also, the price of rice in the production area is higher than that in Shanghai. Therefore, most rice merchants cannot transport it. It is said that the establishment of the rice price review committee is to encourage rice merchants to go to the production areas to purchase rice. The committee will determine a reasonable price based on the purchase cost, and then the rice merchants will supply and sell it at the price. It is now learned that some rice shops have purchased rice and transported it to Shanghai. However, since the rice price review committee has not yet been established, the selling price cannot be determined. On the one hand, customers are rushing to urge purchases, so they feel very distressed. Yesterday, the Taishan Rice Store on Henan Road was reported for selling its own white rice at a price of 66,000 yuan, and the rice industry pointed out to reporters that this was a major example of distress.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The newly established Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau started its work the day before yesterday. According to Section Chief Ji Mingzhai, the most important task of the section is to distribute rice to each rice shop. In order to completely solve the rice shortage, the government and rice merchants must cooperate effectively.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Financial Account, Surplus in April, Deficit in May</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to Qian Jianfu, Chief Secretary of the Finance Bureau, the city's financial statistics show a loss of 200 million yuan in March, a surplus of 2.7 billion yuan in April, and a loss of 2.5 billion yuan in May. Among them, April's performance was the best, mainly because April is a peak month for tax revenue, and the situation in all aspects was tense at the beginning of the new mayor's term. The reason for the worst performance in May was that the summer season arrived, the weather was hot, and the business of amusement parks and restaurants was light. Therefore, the tax revenue for the next three months may not be optimistic, so the city's financial income will inevitably be less than expenditure. Although the central government changed the revenue and expenditure system and allocated some direct tax deductions to the local authorities, many taxes have not yet been levied (such as land tax), and many taxes have not yet been transferred (such as business tax). Therefore, the city's financial difficulties have not been resolved. As for the central government's promulgation of the increase in the treatment of civil servants, the funds will be allocated by the national treasury in June, and from July, the municipal finance bureau will bear the burden. When asked by reporters how the current finances compare with the former British Concession Bureau, he replied: The former British Concession Bureau also had annual losses, which were made up for by issuing public bonds. However, the current municipal finance bureau has no right to issue public bonds, so its own difficult situation cannot be resolved by itself.</p>
<h3>Fake Ministry of Finance, Political Vice Minister Yan Jiachi's Case Closed: Bent Back and Stooped, Helped to the Court; Standard Article Praising Underground Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Zhisan, the former director of the Enemy Property University and the political vice minister of the puppet Ministry of Finance, Yan Jiachi, underwent the final interrogation yesterday afternoon at the Special Criminal Court of the High Court. According to Yan, he originally suffered from heart disease, with attacks lasting only three to four minutes each time. After being imprisoned for nine months, the illness has worsened, with attacks lasting three to four hours, posing a constant threat to his life. Yesterday, when he appeared in court, Yan was bent over, coughing frequently, his hair gray, his face gaunt, and he held a bamboo-ribbed fan. He was helped to the court by a bailiff. He spoke only a few words before shouting that he was thirsty and unable to speak. He asked for a glass of water, took a sip, and then continued to answer questions. His defense consisted of three points: (1) The puppet Huaxing Bank was negotiated and established by the rebel Chen Jin and the enemy's Zhengjin Bank. He did not hold any position, so the charge of "issuing counterfeit currency to disrupt finance" rests with the rebel Chen, not the defendant. The defendant made every effort to prevent the issuance of "Huaxing Coupons," ultimately preventing their circulation. (2) The transportation of salt in the occupied areas was originally under the control of the Japanese Navy. The defendant promoted the cancellation of this control. (3) The defendant believed that open opium smoking was detrimental to the nation's vitality and extremely harmful. He urged a strict ban and paid attention to it. In addition, He Shizhen, a special commissioner of the Military Affairs Commission, testified that Yan did indeed contact the central government to rescue underground comrades. After the defendant's lawyer defended him, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for 9:30 a.m. on the 13th of this month. In addition, Gu Jiren, the deputy director of the business office of the puppet Rice Control Association, was also tried and his verdict was scheduled for the same time.</p>
<h3>University Eye Medicine Publisher, Wu Zhisan, Retried</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The director and general publisher of the American Chemical Factory, accused of providing alcohol produced by the factory to the enemy, was retried yesterday. After questioning the witness Uetani Kisaburo, the case was adjourned for further questioning. In addition, Wang Weicai, the puppet chief of the 15th Bao in Longhua Town, relied on enemy power to oppress civilians. Fan Rixin, an intelligence agent of the puppet Special Service Headquarters, colluded with the enemy to arrest our underground workers Zhang Wang and others. The cases of Wang Shuxian, a director of the puppet China Shipping Company, and Yu Jianmin and Gu Guoxiong, suspected of being traitors, were all brought up for questioning and adjourned for further trial. In addition, the cases of Pan Sansheng and Lu Falang, two traitors, were originally scheduled for questioning yesterday, but were postponed because the witnesses did not arrive.</p>
<h3>A Moment of Pleasure, Six Months Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Relief for Northeast Refugees, Remittance of Over 200 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Madame Chiang came to Shanghai a few days ago to raise funds to relieve Northeast refugees. At 5:00 p.m. yesterday, she convened a meeting of the Standing Council of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association at her residence at 9 Dongping Road to discuss relief measures. More than a dozen people attended, including Mo Deyuehui, Zhou Zhirou, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Yu Bin, Kong Xiangxi, Fu Rulin, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Changyou, Huang Renlin, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilong, and Wang Xiaolai. The following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) The original fundraising target for relieving Northeast refugees was 100 million yuan, but it has now exceeded this amount by more than double, totaling over 220 million yuan. Therefore, external fundraising will be closed from today. (2) All donations will be immediately remitted to the Northeast to relieve refugees, and five councillors, Yu Xiao, Yu Bin, and Huang Renlin, and Han Ren, the director-general of the Relief Association, will be dispatched to the Northeast within the month to comfort the refugees. (3) The distribution of funds will be entrusted to the New Life Movement General Association to send personnel to cooperate with local government charitable organizations and impartial gentry, with the most severely affected and suffering refugees as the target. (4) A banquet will be held regularly to thank the artists in the city who raised funds for Northeast refugees, including Dr. Mei Lanfang, to express gratitude.

<h3>Mo Deyuehui Comforts Northeast Refugees in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Mo Deyuehui visited Ding Guitang, the Deputy Director-General of Customs, and Wang Shusen, the representative of the Northeast Relief Branch. They then went to the Northeast Compatriots Reception Center at No. 137 Meijia Lane in the Nanshi to speak to the Northeast refugees who were about to leave Shanghai. He briefly stated: Under the wise leadership of President Chiang, the War of Resistance has ended gloriously. He hoped that every Northeast person could return to their hometown as soon as possible. Ding stated that he hoped to cooperate in building a new Northeast after returning to the Northeast. There are a total of 250 Northeast refugees in Shanghai, who will return home tomorrow on the Fengtian ship. In addition, many Northeast refugees were scattered in various places after the war. There are about 8,000 refugees in Xuzhou, and their current living conditions are extremely difficult. They are preparing to transfer to Shanghai and then return to the Northeast. The authorities are trying to find housing for them as a short-term stopover.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Association Discusses Carrying Relief Supplies, Establishes a Relief Transportation Group to Manage Transportation and Distribution Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held a meeting of the industry at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to prepare for the transportation issues after the Executive Yuan cancels the British ship leasing contract. Representatives from various shipping companies, including Cheng Yuqi, Huang Jiaqiu, and Li Yunliang, and more than 50 others attended. Li Yunliang first reported on the various concrete measures taken to request the government to safeguard navigation rights and the shipping industry. The industry unanimously expressed respect for President Song's adoption of public opinion and assistance in the construction of the shipping industry. They also unanimously resolved the measures for carrying relief supplies. The Shipping Industry Association will establish a Relief Supply Transportation Group, abbreviated as the Relief Transportation Group. The association will appoint three representatives, and the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Executive Yuan will each appoint one representative to form a Relief Transportation Committee to decide on issues such as the transportation of relief supplies and the allocation of ships. A director-general and several staff members will be appointed to be responsible for handling the matter. Shipping companies will also need to sign letters of commitment, stating that they are willing to transport relief supplies to assist in the relief and rehabilitation work and safeguard China's navigation rights. Because Taikoo and Jardine ships have withdrawn from the coast, the Coastal Shipping Industry Conference has been formed to reorganize business and allocate routes, in order to maintain traffic on the South China and North China routes. This organization, together with the already established Yangtze River Navigation Industry Conference and the Shanghai-Suzhou-Zhejiang-Fujian Shipping Industry Conference, constitutes a more complete shipping organization. The shipping industry also discussed in detail President Song's support for purchasing a large number of ships and allocating them to various routes to replace the pre-war Japanese position in the Far East shipping industry, and a special committee was established to plan specific measures and business plans.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Jardine</h3>
<p>Reorganization Unlikely to Materialize</p>
<p>According to Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Industry Association, President Song's approval of the opening of four ports for trade this time is purely to facilitate the transportation of goods. However, in response to the shipping industry's request, Wuhu and Jiujiang, two of the four ports, have been cancelled, leaving Nanjing and Hankou to meet special needs. The so-called special need is that the port of Shanghai is too crowded, and two ports have to be opened to facilitate transportation. However, the shipping industry is still requesting President Song to consider carefully. Regarding the reorganization of Taikoo Jardine into a Chinese-owned company, Li believes that it is just a rumor and is unlikely to materialize.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Meeting of the Press Association</h3>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Press Association will be held at 10:00 a.m. today at No. 415 Continental Shopping Mall, Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Soochow University Anniversary</h3>

<h3>Captured Bandits, All Executed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to sources from military authorities, it was revealed that: In the future, if robbery cases occur in the city, regardless of whether the property is obtained or not, once arrested, they will be reported to the Garrison Headquarters for execution in order to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Third Trial of the Sensational Corpse Case, Lin Buwu Testifies: Hated Her Arrogance</h3>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for the Thirteenth</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational corpse case at the Mount Tai Apartment was heard for the third time in the local court yesterday morning. Presiding Judge Cao Zuwei interrogated the murderers Lin Buwu and Wang Zhengzhong. Xie Yaoting, a lawyer, provided pro bono defense. The court scheduled the verdict for 9:00 a.m. on July 13. Xue Tingfang, the lover of the deceased Chen Huifang, and the wife of the main culprit Lin Buwu, were present in court. Lin's wife was holding a four-month-old baby, looking at her husband and the baby from time to time, with red eyes, and was very anxious. Lin testified again: He shot Chen Huifang at the time because Chen's attitude was arrogant and he was stimulated, which led to the confusion and accident. It was not intentional murder because he failed to snatch the ring on Chen's hand. He said: "My family is not that bad, I wouldn't be moved to kill for a ring!" Presiding Judge Cao further questioned: "According to the police investigation of the case file, it was found that Lin Buwu had committed robbery twice, once sentenced to five years and another time sentenced to eight years, with deprivation of public rights for seven years. Wang Zhengzhong also committed one robbery and one theft. You are all old robbers!" The two criminals' faces changed when they heard this, and they remained silent. After the lawyer defended them, he said that Lin Buwu acted out of momentary anger, and the court should pay attention to the provisions of Article 57, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, "the stimulation received at the time of the crime," and reduce his sentence. As for Wang Zhengzhong, since he did not jointly commit the crime, he should not be regarded as an accomplice. The seizure of the ring, because the deceased's husband was a temporary spouse and not a legal heir, should only constitute the crime of encroaching on lost property, not theft.</p>
<h3>The 24th International Cooperative Day Was Held Yesterday, the Shanghai Branch of the China Cooperative Association Was Established Simultaneously</h3>

<h3>Haji Yaqub Talks About the Recent Situation in Xinjiang, The First Step in Governing Xinjiang in the Future Is to Establish National Sentiment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] This reporter recently visited Haji Yaqub, a representative of the National Congress from Xinjiang, and talked in detail about the recent situation in Xinjiang. The following is a brief record: Xinjiang is an important border defense area of our country. In the past, due to the government's lack of power to reach it, the relationship with the central government was quite isolated. However, it has only been noticed by the Chinese people since the War of Resistance. Judging from the current domestic political situation in our country, the complexity of the Xinjiang issue is no less than that of the Nine Provinces of the East. Most people believe that Xinjiang is a political issue. In fact, the ethnic issue is even more important than the political issue; the Yining Incident is a concrete reflection of the Xinjiang ethnic issue. The settlement of the Yining Incident is indeed the first satisfactory gain of General Zhang Zhizhong's administration of Xinjiang. However, the settlement of the Yining Incident cannot be regarded as the fundamental solution to the Xinjiang ethnic issue, and further efforts are still needed in the future. There are more than a dozen newspapers in Xinjiang Province, divided into four versions: Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Russian. The names of newspapers in various places are unified, all called "Xinjiang Daily." The circulation of newspapers has decreased sharply in recent years. Newspapers that could sell more than 20,000 copies a few years ago now only sell more than 1,000 copies. This is enough to reflect the failure of the government's promotion of cultural work in the border areas. The same is true for education. The number of students at all levels in Xinjiang Province is now only a quarter of what it was a few years ago. The reason is that former Chairman Wu advocated "assimilation policy" and "intermarriage policy," which aroused the fear and dissatisfaction of the people of Xinjiang, and they no longer allowed their children to go to school to avoid the danger of "assimilation." The population of Xinjiang Province is often referred to as 4 million people, but in reality, it is more than this number, probably more than 6 million people. Among them, the Uyghur ethnic group (the Uyghurs are the Turkic ethnic group) accounts for about 4.5 million people. The living standards in Xinjiang Province were very low before the war and in the early stages of the War of Resistance. However, in recent years, they have risen sharply and are now the highest in the country. The reason is that the population has increased sharply, resources are scarce, supply cannot meet demand, transportation is inconvenient, and the import of goods from other places is difficult. Another reason is the impact of the currency system, because one yuan of Xinjiang currency can only be converted into five yuan of legal currency. Haji Yaqub is a Uyghur. According to his proposal, the government should give priority to quickly establishing national sentiment as the primary task in governing Xinjiang in the future.</p>

<h3>Numerous Silver Reserves Waiting for Higher Export Prices</h3>
<p>\[Reuters, Mexico City, June 6th] It is reported that the Bank of Mexico has estimated that if the price of silver reaches US$1.05 per ounce, the total amount of silver currently held in Mexico, including private reserves waiting for export, would reach 250,000,000 ounces. The current official price of silver is US$0.7111 per ounce, with a proposed increase to US$0.9003.</p>
<h3>American Factories Accepting Orders for Chemical Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Recently, raw material merchants in this city received a telegram from a major chemical factory in New York stating that orders can now be placed for "搪精福美林" (likely a brand name or type of formaldehyde), stearic acid, acetic anhydride, benzoyl, soda ash, red phosphorus, and potassium chlorate, with shipping expected in late September. It is reported that the prices for these items have already increased compared to before.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>*   A shipment of base-grade cork has arrived and is being unloaded. This is the first batch of cork to arrive since the war.</p>
<p>*   A portion of Wuxi silk floss has recently been transported to Shanghai for sale. Top-grade floss is priced at one million yuan per "dan" (a unit of weight), and second-grade floss at 820,000 yuan. Businesses involved are still quite active.</p>
<p>*   Chinese tung oil is experiencing very sluggish sales in the British market after the war. In the past, exports to the UK were transshipped through Hong Kong, and in small quantities, no more than 200-300 "dan" per month. Recently, the market has gradually become more active. Tung oil merchants are preparing for direct exports from Shanghai and have already completed deals for over 400 "dan," worth approximately £210 per ton.</p>
<p>*   The Agricultural Credit Bureau of China (中農) is organizing agricultural loans, and the regional divisions are as follows: In Jiangsu Province, the area east of Wuxi in Southern Jiangsu, and the three counties of Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong in Northern Jiangsu, are under the responsibility of the Shanghai branch of 中農. The Wuxi area is directly managed by the Wuxi office of the Shanghai branch. The area west of Wuxi is under the responsibility of the Nanjing branch. Agricultural loans in the Northeast are under the responsibility of the Changchun branch. All other provinces are under the responsibility of the 中農 branch located in the provincial capital.</p>
<p>*   Financial inspection operations, excluding the Northeast, have been widely launched across the country. In North China, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, inspections began on the first of this month. The inspection time in Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces was earlier, and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. According to the person in charge of the relevant department of the Central Bank, for any bank or firm that violates regulations in the future, the four types of penalties will still be imposed: warning, fine, suspension of business for rectification, and revocation of license.</p>
<p>*   In order to protect banking operations, the Ministry of Finance had stipulated that when customers withdraw funds exceeding the amount of their deposits, overdraft agreements should be signed. The financial industry submitted detailed reasons to the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption from this requirement. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Finance has rejected the request and strictly ordered all banks to comply.</p>
<h3>Textile Industry Opposes Disguised Increase in Electricity Rates: Coal-for-Electricity Equals More Than Double the Cost</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of the Machine Cotton Textile Industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces held an emergency meeting on the 5th of this month. More than 100 representatives from the association's member factories attended, chaired by acting chairman Wang Qiyu, to discuss the issue of coal-for-electricity. According to the association's report, the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in conjunction with the city's Public Utility Bureau, submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, which was approved to conduct a three-month trial run starting from June 1st. For the electricity consumption of yarn factories in the Shanghai urban area, a coal-for-electricity method will be adopted, with the Fuel Management Committee supplying coal to the yarn factories at a price of 120,000 yuan per ton, and each ton of coal yielding 600 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which equates to 200 yuan per kilowatt-hour, an increase of 114 yuan compared to the original price of 86 yuan per kilowatt-hour charged by the power company. The association unanimously believes that this coal-for-electricity measure is a disguised increase in electricity rates. Yarn and cloth are necessities for clothing, and an increase in electricity rates will increase production costs. Increased production costs will inevitably lead to higher prices for cloth products, making it even more difficult to compete with cheaper foreign goods, which is a cause for concern. Furthermore, it will also affect prices and social purchasing power. It was resolved to appoint representatives to present the industry's difficulties to the relevant authorities, requesting that the original method be maintained.</p>

<h3>Manufacturers Suffer Losses Due to High Costs Exceeding Silk Prices, Appoint Representatives to Seek Government Assistance, Government Agrees to Subsidize Export Sales</h3>
<p>\[Our Correspondent] According to the person in charge of the China Silk Company, approximately 160,000 "dan" (市秤) of fresh cocoons were collected during this cocoon harvest season, estimated to yield over 10,000 "dan" (關擔) of raw silk. The purchase price for cocoons was approximately 120,000 yuan per "dan." Due to variations in cocoon quality, the purchase price for superior cocoons reached as high as 180,000 yuan per "dan," while the purchase price for lower quality cocoons was as low as 64,000 yuan per "dan." However, purchasing at these prices still results in losses for silk reeling factories, especially for lower quality cocoons. It is reported that one "dan" of dried cocoons requires 260-300 "jin" (斤) of fresh cocoons. Therefore, the cocoon cost for each "dan" of raw silk has reached 2.4 million yuan. Adding processing fees of 1.1 million yuan per "dan," the minimum cost for each "dan" of raw silk has reached a substantial 3.5 million yuan. Based on the Shanghai market price for raw silk, this already results in significant losses. Furthermore, the market price for raw silk overseas is even lower than the Shanghai market price. Therefore, it is practically impossible to export raw silk. However, raw silk is one of China's most important export commodities, and the quantity is also very large. Previously, private silk factories had requested government assistance. It is reported that Premier Song has already instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to review the matter. Therefore, private silk factories have recently sent representatives, including Wang Huanan and Zhou Yuanxun, to Beijing to consult with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is reported that the government authorities have decided to provide practical and urgent assistance for raw silk exports first, and then develop a comprehensive subsidy plan for other export industries.</p>

<h3>Strive for Peace and Reconstruction – Let Us Revisit the Eight Years of Arduous Resistance!</h3>
<p>……The News Agency Reference Room……</p>
<h3>The Lugou Bridge Incident</h3>
<p>The eight-year war of resistance against Japan is arguably the most magnificent chapter in the history of the Republic of China, and also the most arduous. Looking back at this period of history, we are filled with boundless sorrow, terror, excitement, and joy!</p>
<p>When the July 7th Incident occurred in 1937, the international situation was such that, due to the contradictions between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and under the appeasement policy in Europe, democratic countries were retreating step by step, and fascist countries were riding high. Within China, there was a shift from "pacifying internal unrest before resisting foreign aggression" to uniting to resist foreign aggression. Although national strength was exhausted and the people's livelihood had not recovered, under the great crisis of national survival, a great will for unity and self-improvement had emerged, preparing to embark on the path of unification. Japanese imperialists, realizing this point, could not allow China to become strong through unification, and impatiently launched the war.</p>
<p>The "July 7th Incident," like the "September 18th Incident," the occupation of Rehe, the Suiyuan War, and the Eastern Hebei Incident, was by no means an accidental event, but a deliberate provocative action masterminded by Japanese imperialists. However, what distinguished the "July 7th Incident" from the "September 18th Incident" and the Eastern Hebei Incident was China's response. After the incident in which Japanese troops provoked a quarrel during exercises at Lugou Bridge on the night of July 7th, the Chinese government, while adhering to its love of peace, continued to negotiate with the Japanese side through diplomatic channels in an effort to achieve a peaceful resolution. However, the Japanese side, on the one hand, created obstacles during the negotiations, going back on their word, and on the other hand, continuously increased the number of troops entering customs, continued to provoke quarrels, and successively dispatched naval warships to China to demonstrate their strength. Peace was clearly not something that could be achieved by unilateral wishes. Therefore, on July 17th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech in Lushan, explaining China's basic attitude of seeking self-preservation internally and co-existence externally, and clearly revealing the four minimum points for resolving the incident: "(1) Any resolution must not infringe upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity; (2) The Hebei-Chahar administrative organization must not be subject to any illegal changes; (3) Local officials appointed by the central government, such as Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, must not be removed at the request of others; (4) The 29th Route Army must not be subject to any restrictions in its current area of deployment." Finally, he solemnly declared: "We hope for peace, but do not seek temporary security; we prepare for war, but never seek war. We know that after the national war of resistance begins, the situation will only involve sacrifice to the end, with no possibility of escaping. If the war breaks out, then there will be no distinction between north and south, young and old, and everyone will have the responsibility to defend the territory and resist the war, and everyone should be determined to sacrifice everything." This was a solemn and sacred declaration, which proclaimed to the world, to the people, and to the enemy, the maximum extent to which China sought peace, and the final determination to fight for survival.</p>
<p>After this statement was issued, Japan realized that it was impossible to resolve the Lugou Bridge Incident in accordance with the incidents since the "September 18th Incident," and it actively made military preparations, replacing Tadashi Hayao with Kiyoshi Kasaki as the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China. On the 25th, Japanese troops suddenly attacked and occupied Tuanhe while our army was changing defenses. At the same time, Japanese troops departing from Tianjin to Langfang also clashed with our army. Using this as an excuse, the Japanese side issued an ultimatum to Song Zheyuan, which Cao Song Zheyuan sternly rejected. The war in Beiping expanded, and the next day Song ordered a general offensive. Thus, the Lugou Bridge Incident, which had been negotiated for more than 20 days, was completely broken. The expansion of the Sino-Japanese war from a local conflict to a full-scale war was also largely determined.</p>

<h3>Full-Scale Combat, Enthusiastic Unity</h3>
<p>When the flames of war from Lugou Bridge began to spread to Peiping and Tianjin, and the national situation was still in the tense atmosphere before the storm, a full-scale war of resistance unfolded in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Since Japan had launched the war in North China, in order to contain the forces in Central China and to achieve its dream of a quick victory, it had to seize Shanghai, which was the economic and cultural center of China. On August 9th, it provoked the conflict under the excuse of the Hongqiao Airport Incident (Lieutenant Oyama Isao and Saito Takazo of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai rode in a car and carried weapons in an attempt to break into Hongqiao Airport, clashing with the guards). Although the consuls of various countries intervened to mediate, the Japanese side's deliberate provocation showed no sincerity in negotiations. The so-called diplomatic negotiations were merely a cover for military deployments. By August 12th, more than 20 Japanese warships had been assembled in the Shanghai area, with tens of thousands of naval and army personnel, and 2,000-3,000 had already landed, constantly provoking the Chinese security forces. Therefore, the Chinese authorities had no choice but to temporarily and urgently transfer the 17th and 88th Divisions to Shanghai to strengthen defenses. At 9:00 AM the next day, a skirmish occurred in Zhabei. At around 4:00 PM, Japanese troops launched a large-scale offensive, bombarding with artillery, marking the start of the full-scale war of resistance on August 13th.</p>
<p>On August 14th, the National Government issued a statement of self-defense and resistance: "China solemnly declares today that China's territorial sovereignty has been subjected to Japanese aggression; the international covenants, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris have been completely destroyed by Japan. The greatest purpose of these treaties is to maintain justice and peace. China, as a matter of responsibility, should do its best to protect its territorial sovereignty and maintain the dignity of the above-mentioned treaties. China will never abandon any part of its territory. In the event of aggression, it can only exercise its inherent right of self-defense." At the same time, the Chinese Air Force took the lead in bombing enemy ships, engaging in fierce battles in the air and at sea. The citizens of Shanghai and the people of the whole country responded to the government's self-defense and resistance with enthusiastic and inspiring emotions.</p>
<p>The unanimous demand for unity and resistance against foreign aggression within the country gave rise to a nationwide and united war of resistance. In this full-scale war of resistance, it was even more necessary to seek national unity and consistency. Therefore, on August 22nd, the National Government officially ordered the reorganization of the Red Army into the National Revolutionary Army's Eighth Route Army, and appointed Zhu De and Peng Dehuai as the commander and deputy commander of the Eighth Route Army. Zhu and Peng issued a telegram taking office on the 25th. On September 22nd, the government issued the declaration of common commitment to national crisis, which had already been proposed by the Chinese Communist Party in July, and Chairman Chiang's speech accepting the declaration of the Communist Party. On the Communist Party's side, in order to achieve peaceful unification and unity against foreign aggression, it declared to the country: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Three Principles of the People" are essential for China today, and the Party is willing to strive for their thorough realization; (2) All policies of overthrowing the Chinese Nationalist Party's regime through rebellion and the Red Movement are cancelled, and the policy of confiscating landlords' land by violence is stopped; (3) The current Soviet government is abolished, and civil rights politics are implemented in order to unify the national regime; (4) The name and number of the Red Army are abolished and reorganized into the National Revolutionary Army, under the jurisdiction of the National Government's Military Council, and awaiting orders to move out and assume the duties of the front lines of the war of resistance. At the same time, Chairman Chiang also expressed with extreme frankness and sincerity: "Today, all nationals who can believe in the Three Principles of the People and strive to save the country, the government will not ask about their past and will give them the opportunity to serve the country effectively. For any faction in the country, as long as they are sincerely saving the country and willing to fight together under the banner of national revolution, resistance against the enemy, and defense against foreign aggression, the government will openly accept them and concentrate them under the leadership of this Party to work together." These two inspiring documents not only demonstrated the determination of the two parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to cooperate, but also consolidated the foundation of domestic unity against foreign aggression. The following year, on April 13th and 21st, the National Socialist Party and the China Youth Party also wrote to the Chairman one after another, abandoning their prejudices and jointly committing to the national crisis. At the same time, the Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China was abolished, and the mass anti-Japanese movement was widely launched under open and legal circumstances, which greatly boosted the morale of the early stage of the war of resistance.</p>

<h3>The Flames of the War of Resistance Destroyed the Japanese Army's Poisonous Plan to Conquer China in Three Months</h3>
<p>We fought against a powerful country as a weak nation, and before the war, due to domestic and international constraints, we were unable to prepare for the war. Whether it was weapons, tactics, or strategy, we were no match for the enemy. Therefore, in the first phase of the war, we were at a disadvantage everywhere and had to use significant sacrifices to curb the enemy's advance. Then, we used a vast amount of space to buy time, resisting while preparing, fighting while training.</p>
<p>In particular, the situation in North China was the most disparate. Japan had long been determined to annex China. After occupying the four northeastern provinces, it created a special regime in eastern Hebei, and threatened and enticed to obstruct the construction of national defense in North China, alienating the relationship between North China and the central government, and dividing the feelings among the generals in North China. Therefore, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, North China was actually in a state of semi-disarmament, and the gateways to Peiping and Tianjin were wide open. On the 28th, Song Zheyuan ordered a general offensive on the one hand, and had to retreat to Baoding on the other. Peiping and Tianjin fell into enemy hands within three days.</p>
<p>After the loss of Peiping and Tianjin, the war expanded, and the enemy increased its troops from three routes: the Beining Road, the Pinggu Avenue, and the Tanggu Seaport. At the same time, it launched offensives along three routes: Pinghan, Jinpu, and Pingsui, with the main force actually attacking Nankou along the Pingsui Line in the north.</p>
<p>Nankou is the gateway to the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, and occupies an important position in the military strategy of North China. Therefore, after capturing Peiping and Tianjin, the enemy immediately sent the well-equipped Itagaki Division to attack Nankou, putting our army in a rather caught-off-guard situation. On the 31st, the 23rd Army of Tang Enbo was ordered to rush to defend Nankou. Although the strength was weak, they all fought desperately with a spirit of determination. After 20 days of bloody battles, the enemy repeatedly failed to capture it, so they secretly attacked the right wing of our army, bypassed Huailai out of the Great Wall, and formed an encirclement, but Tang's army still held firm.</p>
<p>However, the firm defense of Nankou for 20 days was ultimately affected by the drastic changes in the battle of northern Chahar. (Liu Ruming missed our opportunity and lost Zhangbei, causing Zhangjiakou to fall to the enemy on the 25th.) After the loss of Zhangjiakou, we were in an isolated and deeply suspended unfavorable situation, and had no choice but to retreat to Juyongguan.</p>
<p>After the fall of Zhangjiakou and Nankou, the enemy advanced westward to Shanxi, attacking Tianzhen and Yanggao to seize Datong. Due to Li Fuying's refusal to fight, the enemy was able to quickly complete the seizure of this line of important towns. On September 13th, Datong fell, and the enemy pointed its troops southward, directly pressing on Yanmen Pass (at that time, Liu Ruming successively abandoned Yangqu, Weixian, Guangling, Lingqiu, and Laiyuan). Yanmen was abandoned on the 27th. At the same time, another enemy force occupied Xinghe from Yanggao and attacked Guisui from the Shakou of Datong, and successively occupied Pingdiquan, Bailingmiao, and Jiabusi. Therefore, in the month since the retreat from Nankou, the enemy had almost controlled the three provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar with unstoppable momentum. The only strong resistance and setback they encountered was the Battle of Pingxingguan on September 26th. Afterwards, our army used guerrilla warfare in coordination with the maneuver warfare of the main national army, almost annihilating the entire Itagaki Division, creating an unprecedented major victory on the western battlefield, and temporarily stabilizing the situation in northern Shanxi.</p>
<p>On the Jinpu Road, the Japanese army captured Yangliuqing on August 3rd, but was not able to mount an intense offensive due to being restrained by the battle of Nankou. The two armies of the Chinese army were quite active in counter-attacking, and the two armies remained deadlocked north of Tangguantun until early September. After September 4th, the enemy launched a fierce offensive with aircraft and heavy artillery, capturing Machang on the 11th and Xingji on the 17th. Although the two armies of the Chinese army were active, they were unable to stop the enemy's frontal offensive, and withdrew from Cangzhou on the 24th. The Japanese army then marched straight to Dezhou.</p>
<p>The collapse of the two routes of Jinpu and Pingsui greatly affected the offensive of our army on the Pinghan Line. First, after our army withdrew from Peiping and Tianjin, it concentrated the Liangxiang and Gaoyi counties, relying on the Liulihe to defend firmly. The two armies carried out guerrilla warfare between Fangshan and Changxindian, blocking the enemy's main force from going south. Even as late as September 13th, our army had swum across the Liulihe to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese army. However, at that time, Nankou had been lost, Datong had also been captured, and the Japanese army on the Jinpu Road had also approached Cangzhou. Our army on the Pinghan Road felt threatened on both sides. They relaunched a two-wing encirclement of the Japanese army, with the left wing capturing Gu'an and Yongqing, and the right wing capturing Fangshan. Our frontal defenders had no choice but to withdraw from Zhuozhou, and Baoding also fell into enemy hands on the 24th.</p>
<p>After this, the Japanese army made considerable advances in North China and Shanxi. The enemy army on the Jinpu Road captured Dezhou on October 5th, the Pinghan Road captured Shijiazhuang on October 12th, and then moved west from the Zhengtai Road through Niangziguan, pressing on Taiyuan. At the same time, the enemy army that went south from Yanmen and Tangmingbao advanced towards Yuanping and Xinkou, creating fierce battles at Yuanping and Xinkou. In the Battle of Xinkou, our army fought bravely, and Chief of Staff Hao Mengling died a heroic death, while the enemy also suffered heavy losses. On November 5th, the Japanese army occupied Xinkou, and on the 9th, they occupied Taiyuan.</p>
<p>After occupying Taiyuan, the Japanese army still took the main force along the Tongpu Road southward, directly taking Fenlingdu. At the same time, they took Fenyang along the Tai-Fen Highway, and seized Janshe from Heshun. However, the progress of the war was already in a considerable stalemate. The Chinese army in southern Shanxi was ordered to enter the Huai River and cross the Yellow River, launching a protracted guerrilla warfare in the river valley and hilly areas.</p>
<p>Unlike the long-distance progress of military operations in North China, the Battle of Shanghai was a positional battle of every inch of land, every drop of blood from the 13th of August to the 22nd of August. The initial skirmishes in Zhabei and eastern Shanghai were almost street battles, including the heroic scene of attacking the Wenzhou Wharf. On the 23rd of August, the enemy landed in Wusong, and the battle line spread outward. In order to avoid the range of the Japanese warships' cannons, our country shifted towards the so-called first line of defense on September 23rd, starting from Liuhe in the north, passing through Luodian, Liuhang, Miaohang, Jiangwan, Baziqiao, and ending at the North Station, with a total length of 60-70 kilometers. After holding out against the enemy for another month and thirteen days, the entire line was shaken by the breakthrough at Dachang. Zhabei, we withdrew to the north of the Suzhou Creek, but the eight hundred warriors of Xie Jinyuan's unit still held firm in the Four-Line Warehouse for as long as four days, and were not ordered to retreat into the concession until October 30th.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Yangtze River, our army again set up defenses along the line from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the Suzhou Creek. The enemy repeatedly attacked but failed to succeed. On November 5th, the enemy landed in Hangzhou Bay, and our rear lines in Pudong and western Shanghai were attacked. We had no choice but to withdraw westward, and then Nanshi became the final target of the enemy's attack. The Battle of Shanghai had reached its finale. On November 11th, our army withdrew from Nanshi, exactly three months from the outbreak of fire in Zhabei on August 13th, consuming a total of more than 100,000 enemy troops. This battle may have been a strategic mistake, because it consumed the enemy but consumed ourselves more severely, and failed to seize the initiative throughout, to the point that it affected the new line of defense in the rear. However, from the perspective of the entire strategy, the three-month Battle of Shanghai dealt a serious blow to the enemy, proving that their dream of conquering China in three months was an illusion, and giving the Chinese people profound encouragement and lessons, proving that we are capable of fighting, but the war itself is extremely arduous and must be protracted.</p>
<p>Since the loss of Dachang and the retreat from Nanshi, our army retreated to the so-called Su-Jia National Defense Line, starting from Hupukou in the north, passing through Suzhou and Jiaxing, and ending at Haiyan in Hangzhou. The Japanese army, on the one hand, bombarded Haiyan and Zhapu fiercely, and on the other hand, bombed Suzhou madly, breaking through the defense line, and captured Suzhou on the 19th. (Our defense was not consolidated.) The war advanced into Wuxi and Wuxing along the Taihu Lake. The enemy attempted to threaten Nanjing from the two lines of the Jinghang National Highway and the Jinghu Road. On the 30th, the Japanese navy broke through the Jiangyin blockade line, and Changzhou also fell, creating an unstoppable momentum for the enemy on the Jinghu Line. On December 3rd, Jurong fell, and four Japanese routes pressed on Nanjing. The Japanese army crossed the Yangtze River to the north, taking Pukou and Yangzhou. On the 13th, Nanjing fell, and on the 15th, Wuhu and Dangtu fell. On the 18th, the enemy settled on Jinshan, and on the 23rd, Hangzhou also fell, and our army retreated to the south bank of the Qiantang River. First, on November 20th, the government announced to China and foreign countries that it was relocating to Chongqing to engage in a long-term war of resistance. However, the rapid progress of the enemy on the Jinghu Line and the successive fall of Nanjing and Hangzhou still inevitably aroused condemnation of the government and pessimism and wavering on the war situation among people at home and abroad. Therefore, Chairman Chiang issued a special declaration on the day of the retreat from Nanjing, saying that the center of gravity for China's protracted war of resistance was not only not in Nanjing, but also not in major cities, but actually resided in the vast and strong hearts of the people in the country's villages. The people of the whole country were invigorated, and on the one hand, military deployments were reorganized, and on the other hand, solidarity was strengthened, and the gains and losses and experiences in politics and military affairs were reviewed. On January 27th of the 27th year, Han Fuju was executed for neglecting military orders and delaying military affairs, which greatly inspired the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. On March 29th, the provisional congress of the Kuomintang reiterated the position of uniting sincerely to overcome national difficulties together, saying that "Without unity, there can be no assurance of victory in the war of resistance and success in national construction. Without joint efforts to realize the Three Principles of the People, there can be no genuine unity." At the same time, it adopted the program for resisting the war and building the nation, determining the basic principles of diplomacy, military affairs, politics, economics, civil affairs, and education. As a result, the road to nationwide, all-round war of resistance and national construction, and ultimately to victory and success, became clearer and more steadfast. On April 12th, the organizational regulations for the National Political Council were promulgated. Although it was only a nominal advisory body of public opinion, it was already an unprecedented step forward in Chinese politics. On July 6th, the first session of the Political Council was established and convened in Wuhan, declaring its support for the National Government, support for the Supreme Commander, support for the program for resisting the war and building the nation, and resistance to the end. It also passed many proposals, such as setting up provincial and county councils and launching mass resistance against Japan. At the same time, the mass anti-Japanese movement also flourished. Military service propaganda, public bond solicitation, and donations of money and goods for consolation were all warmly welcomed. The Three Principles of the People Youth League of the whole country was also organized during this period.</p>

<h3>A List of Statistics, Japan Has Been Badly Hit, and Our Air Force Has Won Victory</h3>
<p>Our country has won a great victory after eight years of war. Recalling the beginning of the war of resistance, the contrast between the military strengths of China and Japan was very large; but our military strength became stronger as we fought, while Japan became weaker and weaker. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japan also had to use a large number of troops to deal with the United States, and felt increasingly short of troops, eventually leading to its defeat. Conversely, during the War of Resistance, our country's army continued to increase, and its combat effectiveness became increasingly strong. Especially in the air force, it expanded even faster; so Japan was hit the deepest. Looking at the following statistics, one can get a glimpse of our battle results.</p>
<p>Over the past eight years, our country's air force has launched the following sorties against Japan: 3337 attacks, 20 reconnaissance missions, 151 air battles, 151 escorts, and 42 parachute troop drops. A total of 3897 sorties.</p>
<p>544 Japanese aircraft were destroyed by our bombing on the ground, 5 were possibly destroyed, and 120 were damaged. 5686 Japanese aircraft were destroyed in the air, 60 were possibly destroyed, and 35 were damaged.</p>
<p>7034 Japanese warships were sunk. 543 were injured. 16 wharves were destroyed. 530 locomotives were bombed, and 98 were injured. 40 oil tankers were bombed, and 5 were injured. 5012 vehicles were bombed, and 929 were injured.</p>
<p>548 enemy military positions were destroyed, 299 bridges, 19 radio stations. 96 train and bus stations.</p>
<p>A total of 31,466 Japanese soldiers and officers died in air raids, and 5,581 horses.</p>
<h3>Striving for International Allies, Domestic Solidarity Must Not Be Relaxed</h3>
<p>Let us review the domestic and international situation at that time, aside from military affairs:</p>
<p>Let's start with the international situation. Although at the beginning of the War of Resistance, the leader declared: We are fighting for national survival. Also fight for world peace and justice. Therefore, it is affirmed that our war of resistance must gain more help. However, in the first phase of the war, all we got was public opinion and moral support, and no political, military, or economic assistance. On the contrary, we also suffered insults and humiliations from quasi-fascist countries. However, in September of the 28th year, Europe broke out, and in the 29th year, the German, Japanese, and Italian alliance agreement was signed, and the line of world aggression and anti-</p>

<p>Free Talk　　Nine Years Ago Today　　Shao Fu　　Nine years ago today, I was in Tokyo, living in a Japanese home in Nakano. The landlord was named Ohori Ryunosuke. His wife was a minor clerk in the Ministry of Communications, and his daughter was studying at a women's normal school.　　As usual, I woke up at ten o'clock and started reading the newspaper. The large headlines in the Asahi Shimbun, along with the large photograph of the Lugou Bridge, prevented me from lying on the mat and reading it page by page as I usually did. I immediately got up and turned on the radio, eager to know our government's attitude—a public declaration—but I couldn't get it.　　I went out to find some friends to discuss the development of the situation. Finally, I even went to the Chinese Embassy in Azabu District. At that time, Mr. Xu Shiying had returned to China, and Mr. Yang Yunzhu was acting as Chargé d'Affaires. I didn't get to meet him. The sound of newsboys selling extras continued throughout the streets, and I felt really confused.　　At noon, I had lunch with a classmate named Jiang at a cafeteria near Shinjuku Station. It seemed like every Japanese person was looking at us with hostility. After lunch, we went to see Otaku (Soichi) and Chiba (Yu), who were our school's teachers, to hear their opinions. Their conclusion was: there won't be a war.　　It wasn't because of their words, or the opinions of a few friends, but I returned to my residence alone to calmly reflect on things. Based on my observations in Japan over the past year, Japan's goal is only "North China Economic Cooperation," using the same old methods. The question is, what is our government's determination?　　Therefore, on this day, I made a decision: if the government makes a statement, I will decide what to do; otherwise, I will continue with my original plan. So, I locked myself in my room and worked hard to finish the translation for my friend. I didn't leave Tokyo until August 11th.</p>
<p>Knocking Bamboo Poles　　Yang Mou　　　　"Knocking bamboo poles" is a very common expression in Shanghai dialect. Originally, it meant playful banter, lighthearted jokes. It's very common for friends to "knock bamboo poles" with each other in a harmless way: you treat me to snacks, I treat you to a movie.　　However, when this "knocking bamboo poles" is used by local bullies or people with special influence, the nature of it becomes serious. A little handle, a small mistake, plus their intimidation tactics, becomes an excellent source of extortion.　　Sometimes, the victim of this "knocking bamboo poles" willingly and happily hands over the money, or they may have some doubts in their heart, but they have no choice but to knowingly step into this trap.　　If your watch suddenly stops, or runs slow, you might open the back cover yourself. You see a wheel here, a wheel there, and you don't know where to start. Maybe you'll try to poke around with a needle, but you shake it, and it looks the same as before. There's nothing you can do but take it to a watch shop. The clerk at the watch shop puts on a magnifying glass and seems to examine it very carefully, listening to the sound, turning the knob a few times, and then looks up: "Twenty thousand yuan." Before you can even open your mouth, he continues, "The balance spring is broken, needs replacing. The hairspring is broken, needs oiling, cough cough, twenty thousand yuan, the most reasonable price." You don't understand (if you did, you wouldn't have come to his shop in the first place). There's nothing you can do except pay. What else can you say? He then seriously adds, "Come back in two weeks," to make it seem like he's carefully repairing it. In reality, as soon as you turn around, maybe he'll just tweak something somewhere, and the watch will be fixed.　　Do you need to get glasses? Yes, maybe you're nearsighted, maybe you're farsighted, maybe your eyes are perfectly healthy, but once you step into an eyewear company, aren't they extremely attentive in giving you an eye exam? Yes, and it's supposed to be a scientific eye exam. But if you trust this "science" too much, you'll suffer. The "science" this company uses to test your eyes will be different from the "science" used by another company. They exaggerate wildly, and in the end, they still want you to pay.　　Everyone knows how to perform tricks, but each has their own unique skill.　　Isn't this world all about hard extortion and fraud?　　Perhaps surgery has its ups and downs, therefore some "succeed and become kings," while others "fail and become bandits."</p>
<p>Beginning of Theater Reviews　　Xi Ju　　　　The practice of reviewing plays in newspapers is now prevalent in various countries, both in China and abroad. Seventy years ago in Shanghai, there were no films yet. At that time (early Guangxu period), the only entertainment for the people of Shanghai were Peking opera and Kun opera. The Dan Gui Tea Garden and Tian Xian Tea Garden performed Peking opera, while the San Ya Opera House performed Kun opera. Famous actors such as Sun Chunheng, Du Dieyun, Sun Juxian, and Dong Yueshan were all mainstays of the Dan Gui stage. San Mazi, Wang Haiquan, and Zuo Yuechun performed at the Tian Xian Tea Garden, and they were also outstanding performers of their time.　　When the Shen Bao was first published, it included brief reports on news from China and abroad, in addition to copying Beijing reports. By the early Guangxu period, it occasionally published poetry and essays. It was not until the sixth day of the fifth month of the Bingzi year of Guangxu, the second year (June 27, 1876), that it published its first theater review, titled "Famous Actors Performing." The article stated:　　"The Peking opera of Shanghai has already become famous throughout the country. Yesterday, I saw the play 'Welcoming Song's Coffin,' which tells the story of Wu Mu directly attacking the Jurchen capital and Wuzhu's surrender, written to uplift the spirit of China. The theme is novel, and the performance is excellent. The banners are bright, the soldiers and horses are majestic, and the mourning procession for the two emperors is imposing. The presence of Lama monks truly brings the scenery of the borderlands to life. Yue Wang's loyalty is unwavering, and he speaks with tears in his eyes. His words to the Fourth Prince are righteous and stern, embodying the spirit of a great nation. This was performed by Sun Chunheng, with vividness and color, inspiring a sense of loyalty and righteousness, even surpassing performances in Beijing. Du Dieyun was responsible for the arrangements, which shows his talent." The article was signed "Written by Le Laoren." Note: The Dan Gui Tea Garden later evolved into the Dan Gui First Stage. I remember twenty-five years ago, the Dan Gui First Stage was still the largest Peking opera venue in the central district of the concession. At that time, the New Stage was located in Nine Acre Field. As for the Gong Stage, Xiao Stage, Great Stage, and Golden Grand Theater, their history is shorter, and most old Shanghai residents can still talk about them in detail.</p>
<p>Childhood Again　　Translated from Time Magazine by Wen Yi　　After the American Civil War, an old woman was sent to a mental hospital by her children because their sixty-one-year-old mother was gradually becoming younger. After the director inquired about the old woman's past, he learned that the sixty-one-year-old woman had been very spoiled as a girl. Her parents' status and wealth made it easy for her to graduate from university, and then she married an excellent young man. Her husband had always treated her very gently and never required her to worry about anything. According to her, she didn't even know how to buy a train ticket because her husband always bought the tickets and took her to the train car. Their life was very happy, with one daughter and two sons, but unfortunately, her husband died at the age of thirty-nine. This made her very sad, and she also felt helpless because her husband's estate needed to be sorted out and distributed, and she had to manage three minor children. Although her property was not much, it seemed to her to be a very difficult task. In order to make her children understand that she could be their companion, after the mourning period ended, she dressed very beautifully, often stayed with her children, and made friends with some young women. When she went to parties with her children, she became younger in a matter of months, often wearing her daughter's clothes to the banquet. Since then, she became younger every few months. When her children discovered their mother's abnormal transformation, they sent her to the hospital. After she entered the hospital, the doctors tried to study the cause of her regression, but they could not stop her from regressing. Finally, she became like an eight or nine-year-old girl, calling for her mother in her spare time. When her children went to visit her in the hospital, it didn't seem like they were her children. On the contrary, she was like her children's little daughter. Because the doctors could not stop her regressive trend, she finally became a baby and could no longer walk. She liked people to hold her and often cried to pass the time, completely reverting to the nature of a baby. When her age was shortened to about four or five months, she left the hospital because in that year of recession, she lost all her property. So she was sent to a nursery. She continued to degenerate until she became a fetus. She didn't move, just breathed gently, and eventually returned to her creator.</p>
<p>The Immortals of Lujiawan　　Qing Jian　　Is there such a thing?!　　　　In a corner of Shanghai, there is a group of strange people, a half-monk, half-Taoist "immortal" paired with a self-proclaimed blind incense man, providing free medical treatment to the city's residents. Countless people are flocking to a desolate field where you can hardly see a person's shadow, hoping to get rid of physical suffering.　　The place is near the Lujiaqiao tram station. Just ask the ticket seller or the incense shop clerk when you get off the tram, and you will get very accurate directions. You won't have to walk more than a thousand steps to reach the residence of the immortal. It is said that this long-bearded immortal came from Maoshan and has attained enlightenment for many years. He no longer eats cooked food. Besides fruit, people have never seen him eat anything else. This highly accomplished immortal has an incense man who specializes in lighting incense and candles for people who come to seek medical treatment. He claims that he used to be blind, but was cured by the immortal, so he followed him to serve. Therefore, he is also infected with immortal energy and is now a half-immortal who does not eat cooked food.　　People who come to the immortal for treatment do not need to pay any fees. Of course, incense candles and gold ingots are indispensable. As for fruit, it is a voluntary offering and not a necessity, but most people bring it. Except for the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month and Sundays, the immortal sees patients every day, from about 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.　　The immortal's method of treating illness is very different from that of a doctor. For minor illnesses, people only need to light incense, kowtow, and stand together. The immortal will hold a basin of tap water and sprinkle it on the crowd while chanting incantations. Each person will get a few drops, and with the boundless power of the immortal, the sick body will be cured immediately. Many pious men and women are constantly telling people that they have been cured of old ailments of several years or even decades by the immortal. As for serious illnesses, the immortal will take them into the bamboo fence and arbitrarily chant incantations, or wave his hands over the patient's body, pick up some fruit peels from the ground—mostly orange peels—and give them to the patient to eat, and the illness will immediately be alleviated. It is said that this immortal technique is unfailing and effective in all cases.　　Someone once calculated that among the more than 10,000 people who seek medical treatment every day, 1/10 are from the automobile class, 5/10 are from the rickshaw class, and the rest are common people. If divided by age, 1/2 are young men and women with American equipment and 1/2 are pious men and women of all ages. If this calculation is accurate, then in the two months since the immortal came to Shanghai, about 300,000 patients have been treated by the immortal. Comparing this number with the number of outpatients at the city's public hospitals in the past two months, I am afraid that it could shame medical doctors who have studied abroad!　　Now people are saying that it is the atomic age, but in this age, in Shanghai, the premier city of the Republic of China, there is such a strange drama, which is really an incredible thing! If this news spreads to friendly countries one day, what will they think? I think they will inevitably laugh their jaws off!</p>
<p>Taiwan Snails　　Nai Luo　　　　Taiwanese snails are as big as goose eggs, with yellowish-orange shells, often wriggling in dark corners. It is said that these snails did not exist in Taiwan before. The Japanese brought them from Europe, and now they have reproduced very prolifically.　　People here also eat snails. The method of cooking is to dry the snails by baking, remove the saliva from the shells, then crush the shells, dig out the snails, cut them into slices, add some sugar and soy sauce, and cook them in a pot. It is said that the taste is similar to beef, which can be considered an exotic flavor.</p>
<p>How to Escape from a Fire　　Chuan Qiu　　Telling You Some Common Sense　　　　Recently, there was a fire at the Da Mei Evening News. A gentleman jumped from the fourth floor because the stairs were burned. Fortunately, it was daytime, and people below helped by stretching out a canvas, allowing him to land safely. But at the same time, two women and children had no way to escape and were eventually buried in the fire. These kinds of things happen frequently in big cities. So firefighters often say, "If you can run out, it's a good house." Perhaps we can add another sentence: "A good homeowner is one who knows how to escape in a critical moment."　　These words are not trite clichés. Recently, in a city in the western United States, two children in their teens died in a fire in their home, both of them burned to death at the bedroom door. Originally, outside their bedroom on the second floor, there was a corridor, and below was a garden, so they could have jumped down safely. But in the sudden terror, just like many people act in the same circumstances, they started running towards the stairs, and as a result, they lost their lives.　　According to statistics, 3/4 of house fires that cause death are due to the fire starting downstairs, burning people to death upstairs. The reason is simple: heat rises. When a fire burns, the hot air and burning gas above often reach temperatures of 800 to 1000 degrees Celsius, and immediately fill the upper floors of the house. People wake up from their sleep and rush from the bedroom to the outside, often falling halfway. They die before the flames actually reach them.　　If some common sense can be instilled in the public and some training is provided, countless lives can be saved. If you wake up smelling smoke, never open the bedroom door. First, put your palm on the door frame above your head. If the wood is hot, never open the door, it's too late! Hot wood tells you that the room outside the door is already controlled by deadly heat, and you can no longer use the stairs.　　Therefore, you should keep the door tightly closed. If possible, jump out of the window, or at least shout for help loudly from the window. Since you have isolated the door from the fire, you have every chance of survival until the rescue workers arrive.　　If the wood is not very hot, you can carefully open it and take a look. At this time, you should use your legs to strenuously support the edge of the door, ready to close it immediately, and then open it gently by an inch or two. If hot air rushes towards you, you must close the door immediately and run to the window.　　In a burning house, the most critical actions are opening and closing doors, which are equally important. People find a fire in the house, and run around in panic, leaving the doors behind them open, so that the accumulated heat and smoke can flow freely upward, without any hindrance. If the door to the room where the fire started is immediately closed tightly after running out, then the flames, heat, and gas can be confined to that area for at least a few minutes, and the house may be preserved.　　There was a young housewife who was lighting a coal stove in the kitchen and added some kerosene, causing a vapor explosion and flames to fill the entire kitchen. She was flustered and panicked. When she regained her senses, her first thought was that her child was sleeping upstairs, so she hurried out of the kitchen, ran upstairs, picked up the child, and started running downstairs. At this time, the neighbors had already notified the fire department by telephone, and the fire truck immediately arrived to help. But when they walked into the house, they found that both the mother and child were dead in the upstairs room. Upon inspection, it was determined that they were killed by the smoke that rushed upstairs because she had not closed the door behind her.　　Firefighters all admit that many homeowners and children would not have lost their lives if they had known and practiced this simple common sense of opening and closing doors.</p>
<p>News Tidbits, Do the Officials' Wives Feel the Same?　　Feng Yi　　The major embezzlement case at the Two Roads Material Office has been investigated and interrogated by the Police Chief for many days, and the truth has been revealed. The main culprit is Yu Xiangyan, the wife of Zhang Hongtu, the director of the Material Office. This made me think of a speech given by the mayor's wife at a gathering, in which she said that a wife's thriftiness can reduce her husband's corruption in his duties. These words from the mayor's wife can be said to deeply understand the minds of general wealthy wives and are spoken with feeling. From this, I also think of some "civil servant" wives who usually act high and mighty, and though they keep complaining that their husbands' salaries as civil servants are too meager to maintain their livelihood, they are actually spending lavishly, making people suspect that they brought family property to subsidize their husbands. Now, we can at least get a part of the answer: these lavishly spending "civil servant" wives are not all bringing family property to subsidize their husbands. We sincerely hope that the mayor's wife's words can serve as a warning and a wake-up call to general wives! I believe that Mrs. Yu Xiangyan is just one occasional discovery in Shanghai's sea of desire!　　Recently, a group of speculators in two types of unified bonds lost their fortune in the adventurers' paradise, leading to the collapse of several securities firms and many people being imprisoned, ending up with ruined reputations. When they initially speculated in "unified bonds," they wanted to ride the wave and make a killing, but unexpectedly, the term "unified bonds" became a curse, and they eventually ended up "unified" with "debt" all over them!　　Recently, when I opened the newspaper, the news was full of cases of corruption, embezzlement, and large-scale fraud. When we look up and see the four big characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" on the International Hotel, high above, it is a stark contrast. It seems that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are too far from the citizens, so the feeling for Shanghai citizens is only one of ridicule and sarcasm!</p>
<p>Comic Strip: Sanmao Joins the Army (57) by Zhang Leping</p>
<p>Social Services　　Answers to Readers　　Legal Queries　　　　Shen Shengwen, a long-time reader of Shen Bao, asked the editor: Your column is the mouthpiece of the people and the blessing of society. I humbly submit four points and pray for your reply.　　In the summer of the third year of the War of Resistance, a fake Bao chief forced the reader to move out of his house and use it as a fake Lianbao office. At that time, the reader was forced by the power of the enemy and had no choice but to obey. He has been enduring in silence for several years, and has complained, but after victory, he has encountered the same situation again. I humbly present my grievances and respectfully ask for your response. (1) Do the homeowners have the right to reclaim and use the houses occupied by enemy and puppet personnel during the War of Resistance after the victory? (2) Does the Shanghai Baojia Regulations have the same provision as Article 32 of the Jiangsu Province Baojia Regulations, which stipulates that the Baojia chief's office should be located in his own residence and should not be set up elsewhere? (3) If the Baojia chief still occupies the people's houses after the victory, is this against the law, and can the homeowners ask him to return it? (4) What is the appropriate and legal way to ask him to return it?　　[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] (1) (3) If it can be proven that the enemy and puppet personnel occupied the houses by force, you can ask them to return it. (2) You should inquire with the Baojia Office. (4) First, use a reminder procedure, and if it is ineffective, then seek a court ruling.　　(II) Ni Jue asks: Miss Yin, a friend of mine, was pursued by a foreign puppet official when she was studying in middle school. He used all kinds of tricks, including coercion and enticement. My friend was young and inexperienced and admired vanity, so she married him. After the marriage, she realized that her husband had a previous marriage. Limited by the circumstances, she did not dare to resist. She also has a little girl. Now, Miss Yin feels that her future is bleak and is suffering from the pain of being henpecked. Moreover, there is a large age gap between her and her husband. She intends to file a petition with the court for a divorce. Please answer: (1) Miss Yin is only nineteen years old and has not reached the legal age of adulthood. Does she have the qualifications to file a lawsuit? (2) Is her husband guilty of seducing a minor and bigamy? (3) Can she file a petition with the court (because she has no parents) for divorce and request alimony independently? (4) Who should have custody of the child?　　[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] (1) Since she is already married, she has the capacity to be a party. (2) Marrying again while having a spouse constitutes a crime under Article 237 of the Criminal Code. (3) If the above situation exists, you can sue for divorce and compensation for damages. (4) If there is an agreement, follow the agreement. If there is no agreement, follow the court ruling.　　Wang Houpei asks the editor: (1) At the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I immediately joined the army. My father had more than 30 mu of land, which was bought cheaply during the period of occupation. Can it be redeemed?　　　(2) Check the Southeast Daily (Hangzhou edition) February 8th issue carrying a section on the Executive Yuan's protection of the property rights of soldiers' families.　　(3) Enclosed is a current news dispatch from the Southeast Daily, February 8th, for reference:　　(Current News Dispatch) The Executive Yuan has decided at a routine meeting to protect the property rights of the families of soldiers who are serving in the military. All contracts for the sale or transfer of property of soldiers' families, whether in the occupied areas or in the rear, must be signed and sealed by the soldiers themselves in order to take effect. Otherwise, if the soldier returns, he can still petition the government to redeem the property at the price it was sold at the time. This has been communicated to all provinces and cities for compliance.　　[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] (1) If there was no coercion or fraud, you cannot claim that the sales contract is invalid. (2) The Southeast Daily is published in Hangzhou, and the returned manuscript does not indicate that the investigation has been completed.</p>
<p>Removing the Sludge, the Public Works Bureau Has Complied</p>
<p>"Handed Down by the Bureau"</p>
<p>Regarding the reader Zhu Chengwen's letter, which your newspaper forwarded, stating that the workers of this bureau piled the sludge at the entrance of a lane in Jiangsu Road when they were dredging the sewers in West Shanghai, and requesting prompt removal, we immediately sent workers to remove it, and it was completed on the 24th of this month. We hereby reply for your information. Sincerely, the Ditch and Sewer Engineering Office of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau.</p>
<h3>US Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar Remain Weak, Spot Market Gradually Stabilizes: Recovering and Rising 25,000 From Previous</h3>
<p>The spot market calmed down slightly yesterday. After the opening, it gradually rose from 1.91 million. The Central Government allocated 29 units, and the price was reduced to 1.9225 million. At this time, it hovered around 1.92 million without any other changes. Around noon, the situation calmed down slightly, and the gold price also stabilized at around 1.93 million. In the afternoon, it was Saturday, and there was little change. The asking price was slightly firm. As a result, it recovered and rose 25,000 from the previous day. There was little change in gold ornaments. The unofficial rate was stable, and the interest rate stood at around 20%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars remained weak, far less than the spot market. In the early morning, it briefly rose to 2510 yuan, but was immediately surrounded by sellers. It briefly fell to 2470 yuan in the middle of the day, and struggled around 2490 yuan at noon. There was little change in the afternoon. Due to Saturday, there was even less activity. As a result, it fell slightly by 20 yuan from the previous day. The exchange rate for gold could be increased to 770 yuan per ten taels. The supply of Hong Kong dollars also exceeded demand, falling another 5 yuan, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 540 yuan, the Indian exchange rate at 660 yuan, and the British exchange rate at 8600 yuan, all showing a surplus with a lack of support. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>No Financial Problems: Bank Association States</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that a certain money shop had a large shortage of orders, and also claimed that another two or three financial institutions, such as so-and-so, "also had problems." According to a director of the Bank Association and a director of the Money Industry Association, after the exchange between banks and money shops, there were either surplus orders or shortage of orders. It is common for money shops to have shortages of orders. On Friday, a certain money shop did have a larger shortage, but it was far less than the figures published in a certain newspaper, and it had already been made up that night. As for the claim that so-and-so and other institutions had problems, the association had not heard of it. In short, the nature of deposits in banks and money shops now comes and goes, and is not as stable as before the war, which is indeed a fact. In reality, the money supply in the market is generally more relaxed on most days. Since the money supply was once extremely tight at the end of June, it has already eased by the beginning of this month. Recently, most of the industry has adopted a cautious attitude, and a financial crisis is unlikely to occur. The public should not rashly spread baseless rumors and frighten each other.</p>
<p>Further news, since the silver and money industry in this city reopened after the vacation at the end of June, the central bank tightened the money supply, causing several banks and money shops to have insufficient turnover. It is now known that these banks and money shops had taken measures on the previous day until 12:00 PM to balance the money supply, and all of them opened for business as usual yesterday morning. For example, Shanghai Pudong Bank, Dunyu Money Shop, and two trust companies have all temporarily resolved their difficulties. It is said that the industry has also provided a lot of support to avoid expanding the crisis. Yesterday afternoon, the person in charge of the Shanghai Clearing House stated that several banks and money shops that had not settled on the previous day had taken measures to make up for it that day, and there were no changes for those listed for exchange yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Continue to Fall: A and B Reach 180 Yuan</h3>
<p>Some people with large holdings of public bonds A and B sold them off, and some retail investors moved to C, D, and E for small-scale activities, causing the former to fall from 300 yuan to 180 yuan. On the contrary, type C rose from 400 yuan to 480 yuan before closing. Types D and E remained relatively stable. As a result, types A and B fell by another 90 yuan from the previous day, types C and D fell slightly by 20 yuan, and type E fell slightly by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medium-Grained White Sugar Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly tight. The association's clearing price for spot grade 20 medium-grained white sugar was initially 100,800 yuan to 77,500 yuan, and then 8,000 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000 yuan. Road goods rose by 2,000 yuan to 94,000 yuan. Only the Shantou gang opened 780 packages of ordinary Huanggang Qing, priced at 85,600 yuan, and the rest did not trade.</p>
<h3>Wuyi Black Tea Transaction: Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang Purchase 1,200 Boxes</h3>
<p>In the foreign company tea market, the British model chamber of commerce, and foreign companies are still inspecting the export patterns. The Wuyi black tea, which was discussed a few days ago, has already been agreed upon. Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang Tea Company jointly absorbed 1,200 boxes, priced at 56,000 yuan per picul. In addition, Wang Yutai, Xinye, Hua Tea, and other firms are still in negotiations. As for domestic sales tea, although the rainy season continues, the shops on this street and in nearby areas such as Suzhou and Wuxi have their own replenishment, but prices have not seen a surge.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Price Increase Has Been Stopped</h3>
<p>Asphalt is in demand for soap making, so the price rose by more than 20,000 yuan last month, and all producing areas also hid their goods and soared in price. Therefore, there was a possibility of continued price increases. However, the recent tight money supply in the market has caused most soap factories to be cautious in purchasing goods, and transactions have not been lively. Although the market is not likely to ease, it is still lacking in excitement. It is said that the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau entrusted the customs to auction off a total of 1,560 piculs, which have been bid on. It is bound to be sold on the market. This batch of goods is extremely poor, and the selling price is naturally cheap. Therefore, it is unlikely that prices will continue to rise in the near future. The selling prices of various firms have not changed, as follows: Heben 86,000 yuan, Neiping oil 80,000 yuan, Duzhu oil 76,000 yuan, Diga oil 78,000 yuan, ordinary Lan oil 72,000 yuan, Macheng oil 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wool Fabric Transactions Gradually Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I inspected Qipan Street and Yishe Chang Le and other places. Wool fabric transactions are gradually picking up, but they are limited to dark colors for autumn and winter. Summer light-colored thin goods, except for those directly designated for retail, are also not actually accepted by the owner even if the wholesale price is 3,000 to 5,000 yuan cheaper per yard according to the market price. Generally, the business of street vendors and customers is more numerous than at the beginning of the week. The standard has not changed much. Fine wool goods seem to be more firm and active, because the purchasing agents of various gangs all want fine wool fabrics. The sellers, aware of the shortage of goods in the market, want to raise prices, but there are still two months before the actual sales, and both parties have to calculate interest. In addition, American goods continue to be imported, and British goods are shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai and are already on the way, so buyers are unwilling to pay higher prices during the current weekly off-season.</p>
<h3>Male Silkworms Spin More Silk: New Invention by Scientists: Control the Reproduction of Female Silkworms</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Professor Osdoonov recently made an invention that is of great importance to the silk industry and science in practice. This invention is a method of controlling the sex of silkworms. Because male silkworms spin more silk than female silkworms, a method is used to distinguish them, and at the same time control the reproduction of female silkworms, so that the number of male silkworms can be increased, and the silk spun is naturally larger.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Shanghai Shipping</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] According to investigations by reporters, there are currently 90 shipping companies in Shanghai, of which more than 20 are open for business. The total tonnage of all ships is less than 200,000 tons. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has 300,000 tons. Most of the 90 companies that have not opened were sacrificed during the Anti-Japanese War and are now waiting for government compensation. Regarding shipping routes, there are currently ships from Minsheng, Dada, and Datong companies operating on the Yangtze River line, with an average of about one ship per day, which is still convenient. The difficulty is that there are too many returnees from Sichuan, and there is a tendency for supply to fall short of demand. On the Jiangbei line, northern Jiangsu has always been the supply base for Shanghai Minsheng, and pork, eggs, etc. are all transported from there. Passenger transport is not crowded due to the Communist Party. Currently, the only places with navigation are Nantong, Haimen, and Chongming. Dada and Datong companies all have ships operating on schedule, with an average of two ships per day. On the Ningbo-Wenzhou-Fujian line, there are currently Zhoushan, Chuanshan, Jiangya, and Ping An ships operating, and they can all sail on schedule. However, very few goods are shipped out. Only Fuzhou has wood shipped in. On the north and south ocean lines along the coast, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company currently has 39 seagoing vessels with a total of 140,000 tons operating, and private companies have 16 vessels with a total of 40,000 tons. Recently, due to military transport, it has been slightly crowded.</p>
<h3>Weakness Envelops the Securities Market: Even Popular Stocks Unable to Resist</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fell again, with large, popular stocks initially trying to resist, but soon collapsing. Small stocks were weak as soon as they entered the market, but after falling, many people saw cheap absorption, and instead reported a turnaround, reversing the situation of the previous day. Yongsheng Yarn fell from 435 yuan to 395 yuan, Mei Ya fell from 3,700 yuan to 3,300 yuan, Jingfu fell from 190 yuan to 175 yuan, Xinguang fell from 200 yuan to 185 yuan, and Qinxing fell from 160 yuan to 142 yuan. At noon, only large stocks were considered stable, while small stocks all rebounded slightly. As a result, Yongsheng Yarn and Mei Ya each fell by 10%, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by about 5%. Cold medium-sized stocks were flat, while small and veteran stocks were all dragged down by about 5%. Transactions were not smooth.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks fell sharply again at the end of trading yesterday. Although large investors absorbed them from time to time, the money supply was still tight, and most of them were old long positions being sold off, and the buying sentiment was finally overwhelmed. Yisha fell from 7,400 yuan at the morning opening to 7,000 yuan, and Yinglian fell from 7,000 yuan to 6,600 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Except for Yeguang, which was sluggish and the asking price was not affected, most of the others lost color. As a result, Yisha, Yinglian, Wheelock, and Asia each fell by about 10% from the previous day, while Yisha Beer, Paper Industry, and Steel Industry fell by 5%, and only Yeguang was flat.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Sentiment Gradually Stabilizes: Spot Cotton Transactions Still Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable. Regardless of large or small factories, there were inquiries. Although transactions were not numerous, the sentiment was stabilized because of this. 20-count yarn rose by about 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. 42-count yarn, because only cone yarn was available from Fangjian yesterday, and weaving factories needed to transfer shares, was uniquely good by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn also followed and rose by 30,000 yuan. The Cantonese gang slightly eased their appetite.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton reported a rise of 6 to 9 pounds per note, with the near-term price at US$31.06, the long-term price at US$31.30, and the spot price of Mitelin at US$31.73. Spot cotton transactions in this port were still good. Private yarn factories such as Shenxin, Dasheng, Jiafeng, and Qingfeng yarn factories all purchased, and market prices continued to be tight.</p>
<h3>Golden Hook Ear Recovers to Original Level</h3>
<p>Tree Fungus and Dried Scallops Rare and Expensive</p>
<p>After a large batch of golden hook fungus arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, the price fell slightly, but because the cost of production was too high, the vendors were unwilling to sell it off lightly, and it was especially needed for the season, and sales from all directions were not weak. Now it has recovered to its original level. Since the Cantonese, Wenzhou, and Taiwanese gangs started to buy tree fungus, the stock in the market has become thinner, and there are fewer incoming goods, while domestic sales in this street are still smooth, so the price has continued to rise steadily. Dried scallops and tree fungus are scarce and expensive. Other goods are affected by the tight money supply and have turned from stable to sluggish.</p>
<h3>Tong Yi Trust Company's 25th Anniversary: Organizing Commemorative Deposits</h3>
<p>Tong Yi Trust Company was established in July of the tenth year of the Republic of China and has now been in existence for twenty-five years. In order to commemorate the 25th anniversary of serving society, the company will not hold a ceremony, but will organize a special commemorative trust deposit. It is said that the interest is generous and there are also dividends. In addition, the commemorative reception expenses are saved and used for scientific scholarships to benefit students.</p>
<h3>Efforts to Alleviate Rice Shortage: Food Transported from All Directions: Directly Allocate to Rice Shops: This Measure Will Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>Recently, rice and grain have been transported to Shanghai from all directions, and the authorities have gradually unblocked them. All shipments are strictly supervised by the authorities, and will soon be directly allocated to all legal rice shops at official prices, and sold at the market price in stores. This measure is only a matter of time. At that time, not only will rice shops have rice to sell, but they will also continue to be allocated, so the trend of food supply in this city will not be difficult to return to normal in the near future, and the general panic situation is expected to be resolved easily. Yesterday, 6,000 piculs of Jiangxi indica rice were allocated and sold in the north and south rice markets at a price of 42,000 yuan. Flour was weak in the morning and stable at noon. Retail customers and visiting gangs slightly purchased wheat, and the price of goods was raised slightly. Soybeans were flat. Shantou village shops inquired about soybean cake, and the market shape was stable. The oil market had a surge of incoming goods, and digestion was not smooth. The factory's wheat has not yet opened.</p>
<h3>The Ratio of Imports to Exports is Currently About Four to One</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] It is reported that at present, the import and export trade materials of our country, in addition to a part that adopts barter trade methods, the number handled by the Central Trust Bureau on behalf of the government accounts for about one-third of the total amount. The rest is still controlled by merchants. According to recent statistics, the main export materials shipped to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are pigs, tung oil, and raw silk. The main exports to Japan are salt and wheat bran. Import materials include wood, newspapers, flour, rice, rayon, railway equipment, hardware, pigments, silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds, etc. The ratio of import materials to export materials is four to one. If the traffic situation is favorable, there is still a tendency for import materials to increase. The government has high hopes for export materials, but due to domestic labor costs and exchange rates, it is not optimistic that export materials will increase in the short term.</p>
