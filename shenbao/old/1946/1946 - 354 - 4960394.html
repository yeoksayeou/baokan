<h3>杜魯門總統發表聲明美國對華政策不變譴責共黨破壞和平商談</h3>
<p>美國杜魯門總統於十八日華府記者招待會上，發表長三千五百字審愼之聲明，重申美國對會之政策，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）美國支援中國國民政府之立塲，去年十二月發表之聲明繼續有效。</p>
<p>（二）駐　美軍短期內將裁减至一萬二千人，其任務僅爲協助中國遣送日僑及保護交通綫。</p>
<p>（三）馬歇爾特使在華爲促進中國統一和平，已有其之越之成就，馬使在華對解決中國國內困難，將有莫大的助益。</p>
<p>（四）中國各黨各派之政協會議，因共產黨之停止協商而遭破壞，馬使因感問題之嚴重與和平之重要，故仍留駐中國。</p>
<p>（五）停戰協定因衝突不息而遭破壞，以共產黨侵佔長春爲最高潮。</p>
<p>（六）進出口銀行將另以五萬萬美元貸與中國，此款能否撥給，將依據去年十二月美國政府所闡明之政策。</p>
<p>（七）美國準備協助中國恢復和平，達到政治民主化。惟美國並無干涉中國內政之意。</p>
<h3>聲明全文</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕杜魯門總統本日發表有關中國之聲明，全文如次：</p>
<p>去年十二月間，我曾發表聲明，闡述本政府對中國之觀點·那時（目前亦然）我們相信團結民主的中國對世界和平洵極重要，擴大國民政府基礎俾其足能代表五國人民，將加速中國走向此一目標的進展，且中國對其他聯合國家負有一種顯而易見的責任，即制止其國土內之軍事衝突，良以此項衝突乃世界穩定及和平之一大成脅也。去年三外長在莫斯科也曾闡明，說我們的盟友英盡商國也都同意這種觀點。去年十二月廿七日，貝爾納斯，莫洛托夫和貝文發表聲明，略稱：</p>
<p>「三外長已就中國局而交換意見，認爲必須有一個在國民政府領導下的團結民主　國。廣泛容納民主人士的國民政府，和一種不干涉中國內政的政策」。</p>
<h3>促成團結與民主乃中國自身工作</h3>
<p>去年十二月我的聲明中，也闡明本政府的政策。我們承認巾華民國國民政府爲合法的政府，我們決協助中國政府善後收復區和解除武裝並遣送日本侵略者。此外，中國若沿着上述的路綫走向和平和團結，我們且準備對中國作經濟上和其他方面的援助。</p>
<p>我敦請馬歇爾將軍代表我前往中國，他的執行方針，將基於本人有關中國的聲明。他完全知道怎樣進行他的任務，他深知停上內戰，擴大中國政府基礎和促成一團結民主中國是中國人民自身的工作。他以美國大國民的姿態前往中國，貢獻他的卓越的才能協助中國人民。</p>
<p>在戰時，巾美兩國政府曾訂立協定，內容與訓練和配備一技特殊的軍隊（共計卅九師）有關。這種訓練工作終於對日勝利日，馬帥抵華時配備移轉的工作，也大部完成。</p>
<p>美英蘇並以解放中國（包括歸還「滿洲」與中國）自任。美政府同意協助中國政府收復自日軍手中解放出來的地區，其中包括滿洲，因爲中國缺乏船隻和運輸機，美方協助送往華中，台灣，華北和「滿洲」的國軍，計空運者三軍，海運者一軍。這個調動大部隊，在馬歇爾抵華前，已完成或已開始。</p>
<p>遣送日軍關係和平</p>
<p>解決武裝和造送日軍的工作，進展太遲緩了。我們認爲在這方面協助中國，對中國及整個東亞未來的和平均極重要。投降但尙未被擊潰的日軍和中國境內的日籍行政人員，技術人員和高人計達三百萬人，這都要在困難的情形下設法遣送之。爲徇中國政府之請，我們遂留駐若干美軍在中國，對日勝利日到臨之時，我們就立即派遣海軍陸戰隊登陸華北，該隊的主要任務爲協助遺送日人。在馬帥抵華之時，已遣送返國的日人只有廿萬人左右。</p>
<p>在他到達中國的時候，馬歇爾將車也面遇極爲不妙的內部情形。因爲戰爭和從那時候起就發生的內戰關係，全國的交通都破壞得很厲害，這種破壞，阻止了中國經濟的復興和救濟物資的分配，並且使　退日僑成爲一種遲緩和困難的程序。戰時工廠的摧毁，因戰爭而發生的通貨膨服，對日勝利日之後，日方在佔領區，封鎖經濟的行動，以及促使全中國經濟生活陷於停頓的交通阻斷，把不可形容的痛苦帶給了千千萬萬的人民，剝奪了勝利對大多數中國人民的重要性，大大的增加中國內部的緊張局勢和爭執</p>
<p>執行總部推展工作</p>
<p>中國自行解決其國內困難，加速完成該計劃極具重要性。在完成此項計劃方面，我們已有諾言，決定協助中國政府。馬帥的經騐和睿智對中國解決其國內困難將有莫大助益。</p>
<p>馬帥抵華後，局面急遽變動：跟着各黨各派一致採納他的大公無私的忠告，全面停戰的協議遂於一月十日公佈，該協議的特徵在於設立北平執行總部。各方僉信爲了交通不便和各地方前綫部隊感情的不融合，停止衝突和退守原防的命令，可以執行的機會很少，除非雙方所信任的聯合執行行性機構，能在各地任何情形下執行任務。</p>
<p>該總部在三委員的領導下進行工作：——一爲美籍人士，任主席，一爲中國政府代表，另一則爲中共代表。美駐華大使館參贊羅伯森氏充任主席，以迄本年秋問返國時爲止。該總部爲在各地進行工作，又在各地普遍設立執行小紐，每一小組由美方，，政府，及中共官員各一人主特。他們馳赴所有戰鬥未停止或相持不下的危險地點，設法實現停戰令，他們常在極困苦和危險的情形下推展工作。總部和小組中的政府和中共官員的合作程度是一大明證，顯示國共爭執雖達廿年之久，兩黨仍不無合作的可能。</p>
<p>政治方面亦有進展</p>
<p>政治方面也有同樣的進展，一月十日，政法協商會議展幕，國共和若干小政黨代表均與會，在直接討論的三星期內，政協已獲致一連串富有政治風尚的關於重要政治和軍事問題的協議。該協議規定組織一過渡性的聯合政府，邀請各黨各派參加，並規定在召開國民大前，沿着民主路綫修正憲草，裁減國共雙方軍隊，以便將來合併成一小規模的現代化的名符其實的國軍，對代表人民的政府負責。三月問，馬歇爾將軍回到美國，他報吿這些協定成立後，中國人民對於和平與團結已獲得重要進展。他也指出：除非中國的經濟降落立即中止，而允其是運輸系統的恢復活動，這些協定無法順利的付諸實施。政治的團結是不能在　亂的經濟上面建立起來的，本國政府已經批准以若干小數貸款借與中國政府，以便適合緊急的善後需要，這種行動，和美國在世界其他戰爭蹂躪區所採取的類同。借款共六千六百萬美元，是用於六種計劃，主要的是購買棉花，船隻和修理鐵路的材料，但是這些緊急若干步驟並不充分，在中國方面依照協定獲得重要進步之後（根據馬歇爾的報吿），進出口銀行另外規定五萬萬美無元，充作可能的另一筆貸款，依據逐一計劃原則，授與中國政府機構和私人企業。至於此項借款實際上能否撥給，顯將依據一九四五年七二月十五日本國政府所關明的政策。截止現在爲止，道一筆五萬萬美元借款，仍未變動，但未撥出。（下文轉入第二版）</p>
<h3>延安方面　將正式答覆美聲明</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十九日電〕中共發言人王炳南頃發表談話稱：延安將正式答復杜魯門總統之聲明</p>
<h3>彭部長談話否認發新鈔</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕彭部長十九日午後於記者會席上，鄭重否認政府將發行孫鈔等新幣之說，據謂：此說「毫無根據，全然不確」。</p>
<h3>中國對美總統聲明不致有正反響　顯示美對華程序不致變動</h3>
<p>〔聯休整社南京十九日電〕中國政府對於杜魯門總統之聲明，不致發生正式反嚮，因高級領袖均信總統之言，乃針對各方　議其一年來對華政策而發，並非對中國而發。國府官員顯然滿意於總統聲明，認爲總統之言，不啻贊同蔣主席向民主前進之行動。中立觀察家雖認爲總統之文吿，並非贊助國府，但相信至少可表示總統制定而由馬歇爾元帥領導執行之程序，在短期內不致有劇烈變動。</p>
<h3>憲草綜合審查結果國大定明日討論昨日大會繼續聽取報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕主席團第廿一次會，十九日下午四時舉行，黃蕓　主席，討論審查結束後討論程序問題，決定廿日上午九時舉行第十一次大會，由綜合審查會報吿審查結果，暫不進行討論，下午無會。廿一日第十二次大會，開始討論。又廿日大會主席由程　擔任，綜合會報吿，由陳誠擔任。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕國大第十一次會議，十九日上午九時四十分舉行，出席代表一一九〇人，繼續由憲草各審查會召集人分別報吿審查經過，主席團第二組輸值，田炯錦主席，秘書處報吿後，秘書長宣讀主席團報吿，（一）大會會期，前經決定延長，自十九日爲止，現查綜合審查工作尙未完竣，大會尙有二讀，三讀之程序，爲經決定再延長二日，至廿一日爲止。（二）憲草第一審查委員會函稱：「本審查委員會審查第十二章選舉時，婦女代表提議，在十二章增加一條條文；即依照第二三四號提案，於憲草第一百卅條條文後增加一項如下：『各種選舉應規定　選名額，至少在百分之廿其辦法由法律定之」，經審查會一致通過，已彙列審查報吿書內，惟第十次大會時，本審查委員會另具之書面報吿，遺漏未列，請補行報吿大會」。討論事項，爲繼續聽取第五·六·七·八各審查會報吿，至此審查報吿工作吿一段落，主席宣布待綜合審查報吿提出後，再加討論，十一時三刻散會，大會下午停止舉行。</p>
<h3>綜審會結束</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕綜合審查會，十九日下午四時一刻舉行，陳誠主席，出席代表一三五人，討論項目如次：（一）立院覆議時人數問題，（二）立委名額問題，（三）第十一章增列蒙藏地方自治制度條款問題，（四）第十一章增列關於省區劃分之條款問題，（五）選舉章，。基本國策分別章節問題，（七）基本國策增加婚姻一條問題，（八）基本國策敎育條款中，規定學生須超出黨派問題，（九）法律之定義問題，（十）憲法之解釋問題，（十一）憲法施行程序之訂定問題，（十二）增加監督促成憲法施行問題，全部討論完竣，於下午六時廿分散會，審查工作至此乃吿一段落。茲誌討論經過情形如决：</p>
<p>（一）立法院復議時之人數問題，整理小組意見認爲依照第三審查會意見，將第五十八條修正爲行政院有向立法院提出施政方針及施政報吿之責，立委在開會時，有向政院院長及政院各部會首長質詢之權，第二·第三兩項中「全體」改爲「出席」，主席報吿上次討論結果，係決定原則通過，交整理小組者，其在人數方面討論之結果，爲兩種意見，一爲四分三之出席，三分二之通過，一爲三分二之出席，三分二之同意兩點。旋由史尙寬起立發言，上次決定原則，即爲四分三之出席，三分二之通過，此項原則業已通過，整理小組在原則上不能變更。曾琦亦謂，上次已有潘代表公展提出四分三之出席，三分二之通過之意見，且已通過，即使不能如此，亦得以三分二之出席，四分三之通過，因必須要有過半數之通過也。</p>
<p>王秀淸謂，覆議人數所以必須多者，乃因立法院如經通過行政院院長即勢必辭職，如人數不多草率通過，將使政局時有動搖之虞，故本人認爲協商以後再交大會。潘公展稱：原則上已屬通過，今日應就以下兩種方式採取其一，一正式提出覆議，二不提出覆議，即再行協商。旋復有陳侃發言稱：四分三出席，三分二通過，此數似已折中，其實不然、因四分三出席人數太多，如此則行政院院長好壤亦不易於更動，而政院即可不對立院負責。嗣由主席發言稱：此一問題並非值得過分注意之問題，以黨的立塲說，倒是少數黨爲多數黨爭，加以四分三爲出席人數標準，則少數黨即可不出席，故如規定多於多數黨，不一定有利，這不是黨派問題，同時，如行政院院長的確不好，誰支持他，就是誰不好，如果立法院對政院有過不去之事，開會時以少數人出席即行通過，但此案仍必須交總統，所以各黨派如重視此案，則儘可事先設法促自已人多去參加。本人認爲，此次綜合會之精神甚佳，不必在此一點爭持不決。</p>
<p>（二）立法委員名額問題，雷震報吿，原草案第六十五條，因若干人認爲第一項對總額之規定有所不滿，其次爲商藏蒙古之分列，因原已有特　　之規定，其餘與原案精神完全相同，旋即無異讓照整理小繼　見通過。（未完）</p>
<h3>民盟中常會最近即舉行</h3>
<p>羅隆　今晚由京來滬</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電）民盟羅隆基十八日晚與　必武長談，十九日下午二時復訪張羣，原定十九日赴滬之計劃延期。改廿日夜車啓程。若干人士認爲渠導之接觸與和談有關。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟主席張瀾抵滬後，連日正與同盟人士非正式交換意見。記者昨向沈鈞儒氏叩詢民盟常會舉行日期，及是否邀請民社黨張君剛出席一節，渠稱：日期尙未決定、大致總在最近舉行。又民盟不預備通知張君勱氏參加。</p>
<h3>彭部長告記者忽爲謠言所惑</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕彭部長十九日宣布「擄我人所獲報吿，某方正有計劃的散播謠言，中傷與汚蔑靑年黨。民社黨及若干國大代表，目的端在使人對國大不滿，余勉向新聞界呼籲，盼勿爲其所惑，輕加散播或轉戰，我人深知新聞自由之重要，然中傷污蔑並非言論自由，對某一黨所發之不正當之污蔑，亦與言論自由之旨相背，目違背新聞記者道德」。</p>
<h3>馬占山飛京</h3>
<p>謁主席陳述東北問題</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕東北保安副長官馬占山，十九日晨九時半乘專機飛京，將晋謁蔣主席，對東北問題有所陳述，的兩週後可返平。馬氏是否是東北就職，將視此行決定。馬部自前决大同吃緊後，已停止縮編，並仍維持東北挺進軍番號，現駐防大同以東鐵路綫。</p>
<h3>王外長出席招待會答制憲外交問題國大閉幕政府即改組</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕中宣部中外記者招待會，十九日下午二時舉行，彭部長學沛主持，外部王部長世杰，應邀出席答解有關制憲及外交問題，王氏表示，深信政府所提憲草之原則及精神，將爲國大接受。王氏並稱譽國大代表之容忍精神，認爲此次大會充分表現國人對民主及代議政治信心之恢復。王氏就國大制憲問題，發表其個人觀感時稱：國大制憲工作，已有極重大之進展，我今日向諸君申說，即我現在深信憲法草案的原則和精神，將被國大接納，大會自將有若干的修古，便將來通過的修正條文在大體上我相信不是對原草案打折扣，而是改善，這種發展，有幾個原因，最重要的原因，是國大代表富有容忍的精神，容忍精神，是民主政治成功的第一個條件，多數者對於反對者的見解，應以虛心去了解，單是虛心還不够，並且要有容忍精神。國民然黨員容忍精神的發揚，也許要感謝中共，我們希望巾共也接受敎訓，這次大會，充分表現國人對於民主和代議政治，已經恢復了他們的信心。民國初年議會政治的失敗，使一般中國人喪失民治的信心，在抗戰以前，尙是如此，今茲信心的恢復，其因雖不只一端，但我相信，過去八年間，國民參政會的實蹟，是促成這種信心恢復的一個主要原因，參政會的職權誠然不夠大，但參政會在知能方面，和政治道德方面所表現的水準，却均不低，他的八年勞蹟，使得一般人漸漸感覺到民主和代議政治在中國是行得通的，民國初年的失敗，是不必重演的，我希望並且相信，這次國大通過的憲法，確能代表全中國人民的意願，而是我們三十五年來艱苦經騐的結品。</p>
<h3>憲法實施程序大會將有決定</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕王氏於發表其個人觀感後，復回答記者問題，關於制訂憲法之手續，王氏稱瞭。綜合審查委員會，現正分別審查各組審查結果之意見，然後提交大會，逐條表決，憲草全案再經大會通過，大會究能何時完成此項工作，目前尙難估計，個人推測，的需五日至一週之時間方可完成。關於憲草修正條文提付表決時，是否仍可討論一問題，據王部長答稱：此事主席團正在考慮中。記者繼詢國大之後參政會之地位將如何，王氏稱：目前尙未能答覆，恐須俟國大閉幕後，由政府或改組後之政府決定，述及政府改組及政府派員前往延安之先後問題，王氏稱：改組政府，俟國大閉幕即將開始。關於派員赴延，政府正在考慮中，尙未作任何決定。王氏繼回答憲法實行問題稱：憲法實施程序，渠認爲應於大會決定。王氏並表示，大會似將有所決定。記者繼詢王氏，如若干代表對通過之憲法不滿而退席，憲法本身是吾將受影響，王氏稱：渠相信不致有退席或多數代表退席之舉，即或有少數退席，憲法亦不致蒙受影響。王氏最後復回答記者所詢渠個人對基本國策中列入「遵守聯合國憲章」一則之意見稱，渠個人贊成列入。</p>
<h3>中蘇兩國政府瞭解確已進步</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十九日電〕下外長談中蘇關係稱：「一年來巾蘇政府對於雙方態度之瞭解，確已進步。</p>

<h3>聯總運華救濟物資決延至明年九月船雙一百艘在來華途中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總各國代表大會第六屆大會業於上週　在華盛頓圓滿結束。據悉：此次大會已一致通國聯總連華物資決展延至明年九月，但規定聯總採辦應中國物資應於明年六月底結束，歐洲方面於三月底爲止，如屆時未能完成，可與各該國洽商繼續之。</p>
<p>又聯總對於行總於過去二月間供應中共區物資成績，頗爲滿意。但仍希望努力供運，以達到聯總公平分配之宗旨。聯總當局並表示決在中國，華盛頓及歐洲各該分署繼續保留有經騐之技術人員，以協助完成運華物資。</p>
<p>該會最後一次大會，定於明年六月底前召開。若屆時大會各委員認爲不需要時，亦可停開。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕新任聯總署長魯克斯頃向聯總職員訓話稱：聯總如欲於指定之時期內完成其供應計劃起見，所有職員均須加倍努力，俾將尙未運出國外之救濟物資，得迅述運出。此項救濟物資總值在六萬萬至十萬萬美元之間。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕聯總宣佈：運華物資截至本月十三日止，共有一，三二〇，八九六噸，上週有船一艘在滬卸貨二，二四八噸，本星期內有聯總船九艘，四艘在滬，兩艘在港，兩艘在汕頭，一艘在大沽，分別卸貨，計共一九，四〇八噸。此外，聯總船隻一百艘在來華途中，其中九十一艘載貨二二三，七九四噸，其餘九艘噸數未詳。</p>
<p>又據行總公佈：十二月七日至十三日一週內，本署運往外埠物資共計三，七〇三噸，就中仍以糧食及工業器材爲大宗，兩項合計佔總數百分之八十二，本週在滬就地分配物資爲三，七八四，四〇噸，運同運往外埠物資共計七，四八八，二〇噸。本週外遝物資分類統計如下：糧食類：一，八三三，七六噸，衣着類：五五九，四六噸，工業器材：八八五，四五噸，農業器材：一三三，九二噸，醫藥器材：三〇一，二一噸，合計：三，七〇三，八〇噸。</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十九日電〕桂行總分署將第八期業務費全部十二億元，移作他用，至各縣市紛電請配發應急，均爲分署拒絕，並聲明一律不予答覆，至各地飢民　斃者日衆。</p>
<h3>欲太平洋上和平須援助東方國家　太平洋學會美分會注意中國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十八日電〕太平洋學會美國分會，上週末在加州蒙德婁附近舉行區域會議，參加代表不下一百五十人，多數爲敎育家，作家及商業家。會中反覆討論，使聽者發生一種感覺，認爲太平洋上如欲和平，必先援助東方國家，使能自助自足，俾其人民生活改善，不再願有戰爭。美國對於中國一般情形，似較東方其他國家更多瞭解，一切辯論往往歸結到中國。印度情形雖更爲複雜，但鮮受注意。有人建議將中國內戰提交聯合國討論，中宣部國際宣傳處舊金山辦事處主任沈劍虹立即加以駁斥稱：美國之經濟失調與生產停頓，正可同樣提交聯合國機構審查。人民因內戰而死，較之因美國航業及煤礦罷工，不能獲得食物而死，是否更慘？此爲一個問題。據其發表之意見如下：</p>
<p>（一）任何地方發生之事件，均與世界其他部份關聯。</p>
<p>（二）東方騷亂不寗，則世界不能和平。</p>
<p>（三）東方國家非得外界援助，不能安定。</p>
<p>（四）按照自然情勢，此項援助大部份當來自美國。若美國不能維持其本國之冶安與生產，援助又何從而來？各方面一致同意，任何外國非先安定其國內政治，不能援助他國民族改善生活。　會中曾討論遠東各國之政爭，並時常提到美蘇兩强在其苦後互相爭雄，尤其在中國，朝鮮與日本。惟蘇聯雖爲一太平洋國家，此根本問題從未加以詳細討論。</p>
<h3>墨西哥黃金七萬兩抵港</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十八日電〕墨西哥黃金七萬兩，由美輪運抵港，以前墨金運港，每次至多不過四萬兩，此次數額之鉅，乃因港與國內各地金價微烈波動，墨金成本，每兩爲港幣二百七十餘元，照目前此間市價，在港售出，每兩可獲利三十餘元，因此金融界爭相電購。據估計：：近三月來墨金運港，每月平均的十萬，港方消化不多，均係私運國內各地牟利。</p>
<h3>論走私問題</h3>
<p>海關貿易統計已不正確</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港十九日電〕遠東經濟評論報今日載稱：中國走私之風熾盛，海關統計已不足用作分析中國貿易之根據。海關所定防止計劃，全非高效率之走私組織對手，日日增加之條例與限制，僅足煩擾合法商人而已。該報以澳門海關爲例云：當地海關所能登記之中葡間貿易，在實際數字百分之二十以下，武裝走私之摩托木船數以百計。該文中並稱：雖然化粧品進口已於九個月以前禁止，由走私運進之存貨數量尙足供應上海市塲數年之久。</p>
<h3>我與阿根延商談訂商約</h3>
<p>明年一二月間可簽字</p>
<p>〔中央社布宜諾斯艾利斯十八日合衆電〕中國政府代表何墨林，頃與阿根廷外長布瑞莫格拉，會商有關商的事宜。衆信該的將在明年一月或二月簽字。陳介大使陪同何氏積極參加工作。</p>
<h3>菲市場菲化法案我正式提出抗議中菲商約聖誕節前簽訂</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺十九日電〕據官方今日宣佈：中國駐菲公使陳質平，頃以中國政府之正式抗議書一件遞交羅哈斯總統，抗議菲政府給予菲人在馬尼刺市塲設攤優先權之法令。（即市塲非化法案）該項法令將於明年元且起實施，屆時全市十一市塲之中國攤販一千零四十五人，將受影響。陳氏力言該法律係特別針對馬尼刺華僑而發之一種歧視措置，因外人之在市塲設攤者僅華僑而已。</p>

<h3>美國對華政策的重申</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統於十八日發表談話，重言聲明，美國對華政策不變，去年十二月十五日所發表的對華政策宣言，繼續有效；並鄭重聲明下列數事：（一）美軍留駐中國，係應國民政府之請，協助中國遣送日僑日俘返國以及恢復中國國內和平與秩序，美軍人數已自十一萬三千人减至一萬二千人。（二）承認中國爲自主獨立的國家，並承認國民政府爲中國唯一的合法政府，美國自應予以支持；一俟中國國內和平恢復，美國即加緊援助中國經濟復興及改革，以促進中美兩國商務關係。（三）馬歇爾特使調處國共糾紛，頗多成就，現國共談判雖已破裂，但馬歇爾特使仍有留駐中國之必要。（四）美國在華所處地位，雖須避免牽入中國內爭的漩渦；但仍須保持飾助中國人民恢復國內和平及復興經濟之政策。（五）美國決不干涉中國內政。（六）對於政飾決議以及整軍方案，均炎示贊成；但對於中國未能以和平方法，達到政治的軍事的統一之目標，則表示扼腕。（七）籲請中國停止內戰，相信統一和平的中國，對於世界和平最爲重要，故中國對於其他聯合國，實負有停止內爭之資任，希望中國政府能　國共　紛覓致和平解決方案。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統的長篇談話，當可日爲美國對　政策不變的聲明，對於中美兩國輿論界，都能發生一種澄淸的作用，尤其是在美國，二三個月以前，曾舉行過一種「美國退出中國」的宣傳週，大吹大擂，說什麽美軍駐在中國，足以助長中國的內亂；最近美國國務院遠東司司長范宣德，也發表過一次勸吿美人勿投資中國的談話；前天又有兩位參議員聯名要求政府，停止單獨調處中國內亂之努力，而主張召開英美蘇三强會議，實行其所謂「共同調處」。美國興論界意見的龐雜，由此也可見於一般了。但是大多數的美國人民，始終認爲美國國對於世界和平，旣負有重大的責任，對於遠東和平的締造，更是責無旁貸，尤其對於中國，應履行其在戰時所提供的諾言，積極協助中國成爲一個强大·統一·民主的國家。杜魯門總統的談話，就是針對着這些龐雜的意見而發，足使美國人民完全瞭然，美國對華究底應該採取什麽政策？一言以蔽之，就是美國應該繼續採取其積極的現實的對華政策。這樣簡單明瞭率直的表示·當可使那些自命不凡的「遠東問題專家」，少動些腦筋，少提些「合時的建議」了。</p>
<p>同時在中國，也可以發生一種澄淸的作用，足使一般幻想美國對華政策行將改變的人們，從他們的迷夢巾淸醒過來。中共自本年六月以來，即不斷的在　頭上。文字上，以及行動上，發動反美宣傳，企圖引起美國輿論界的錯覺，迫令政府改變對華政策，結果雖然失敗了；但是仍抱着相當的希望心理，只要美國人民有什麽主張，就喜形於色，尤其是對於美國參議員　萊與佛蘭德二人的建議，表示極大的重視。殊不知這是他們兩位議員的私見，並不足以代表美國朝野的意見。看了杜魯門總統的談話全文，可知對於美國的政策訛也不會發生幻想的。</p>
<p>我們拋棄了其他一切的因紫不談，僅就中美兩國人民的願望而論，美國對華政策是不會變的。美國所期望於中國的，是變成一個强大統一民主的國家，成爲遠東唯一的安定九。杜魯門總統說：「余相信美國人民對於中國所懷有的願望，與中國人民對於本身所抱的迫切期望，是究全相同的。」這一句至理名言，實在值得我們深思體味的。</p>
<p>緣美國在中國抗戰期間，對於中國艱苦抗戰，不僅首先在精神上表示同悄；而且最早在物質上予以援助。最後中美兩國駢肩作戰，與侵略者日本帝國主義，奮鬥到底，故中國在軍事上的轉敗爲勝，不能不說是靠了美國的力量，但是美國爲什麼願意以全力援助中國以抵抗日本的侵略？這是由於美國人民對於中國懷有一個共同的願望所致。大家認爲中國是愛好和平的國家，應爲遠東和平的基石，在抗戰期間，應該不惜任何代價，要援助中國，擊敗擾亂遠東和平的侵略者；到了抗戰勝利之後，也應援助中國獲得和平與安定，走上統一和平民主的送徑。美軍駐留中國境內，固然抱了這種任務，馬歇爾特使來華調處國共問題，更是爲了要達到這個目標。此在中國，經過八年的艱苦抗戰，早已精疲力盡，在抗戰勝利之後，亟得休養生息，在和平的空氣中，致力於建國復興的工作。所以全國人民，沒有一個不渴望和平，不渴望統一，同時又爲囝永遠消滅內爭起見，也沒有一個不希望「政治民主化」，「軍隊國家化」，這種民意的表現，終於促成了政治協商會的成功，不僅通過了「和平建國綱領」，而且也成立了一種整軍方案，本來在下令停戰之後，中國的前途，充滿了無限的新希望；但是別有作用的中國共產黨，竟不惜破壞政協決議，不惜違背整軍方案，使國內的和平無法實現。其後雖然仍舊進行和談，均未能獲得成就，不僅使中國人民痛心疾首，而且也使骨國人民大失所望。所以杜魯鬥總統也不得不將和談破裂之責，歸話中共。</p>
<p>國共問題本是中國自己的事情，應該山自已設法解決；惟因美國人民對於中國所懷有的願望和中國人民對於本身所抱的期望完全相同之故，所以我們要求美軍駐留中國，並歡迎調人馬帥在中國國內奔走和平。反之，如有人主張召開國際會議以解決中國內爭，匪特這種建議不合時宜，不切實際，而且帶有國際十涉之嫌，決非獨立自卞國家的人民所能接受的。</p>
<p>要之，杜魯門總統聲明美國對華政策，旣仍以去年十二月十五日的宣言爲美礎，則在目前國際環境之下，匪特爲中國人民所糧迎，抑且亦爲英蘇各國所樂聞，我們但望中國的政局也能隨着國際局勢的好轉而開朗。</p>
<h3>杜魯門聲明全文　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>在廣大的援助被阻緩的時候，本政府已完成其對中國的戰時租借諾言。租借式的援助給予中國，幫助好向日人作戰，並且在以後完成協助中國收復日本佔領區的諾言。援助計有貨物，配備和服務數類，其中一半是服務性質的，例如空運和海運軍隊。</p>
<p>據最近的數字，直至對日勝利日爲止，美方對華的租借案援助共值八七〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。從對日勝利日起以迄二月底（就是在馬歇爾抵華不久以後）總數爲六〇二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，大部份用於運輸費方面，自此以後，租借計劃減少，以完成未完　務爲限，但在後來，其中多數也已中止。</p>
<p>剩餘物資處理完畢</p>
<p>依據我們和中國所成立的協議，淸理剩餘物資的結果，已備就大批的民用物資。這一來已使我們淸價了許多賬目而且處理了很多的剩餘物資。</p>
<p>在戰爭期內中國政府以國幣供給美軍，從事建造設備同，供養軍隊，和其他用途。戰爭結束時，這方面的債務達一五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇中國國幣。因爲不停止的中國通貨膨脹，我們無從準確的決定這數字以美元計算的價值。</p>
<p>中國同意購買中國境內和太平洋十七島嶼與基地全部美剩餘物資（僅有若干例外）。購買剩餘物資的飾定終於八月間訂立，談判該協定前後共歷時六月，太平洋方面結束這種工作誠是迫切的事，尤其是在熱帶性氣候下，露天貨倉中的物資每易損壞，且中國人民亦極需要此項剩餘物資。中國境外的美方飛機，所有未解除武裝的作戰物資和固定的設備均不在購貿之列，因此，該協定當不致使任何武器流爲內戰之用。</p>
<p>除三億美元外，中國政府註銷全部我們挪用其國幣的債務，並同意劃撥等於三千五百萬美元之款項，充爲美政府在中國境內之用度和取得或改善我們外交使領方面所需要之建築物和資產之用。並另撥二千萬美元，充爲實施文化敎育計劃之用。</p>
<p>國共談判令人失望</p>
<p>在四月間馬歇爾二度抵華之前，種種跡象顯示休戰協定已被藐視。執行總部及其小組的誠摯與不屈不撓的努力結果，使多處地方性衝突停止，無數生命亦因之得免於難。然而新衝突仍不轟發生，共軍佔領長春後，東北亦因而陷人混亂的危機中，國民政府又未完全同意派遣執行小組到長春去。</p>
<p>政治方面的情形也爲之一變，同樣使人失望，國共雙方的談判一而再地重開，然又時常決裂。談判最後成功的希望雖未完全消失，一月和二月間所獲致的協請都未見實現，若干中國黨派亦未能及時實行政協協議。</p>
<p>遣送日人任務完成</p>
<p>在其他方面，也有令人興奮的進步，尤其是肅淸在華的日本人。依照盟國協議，中國應負責解除所有日方軍事人員的武器，並且遣送中國，台灣，越南（緯度十六度以北）日方居民和軍事人員返國。我們的政府允許在這任務方面，援助中國。這項工作的範圍極處，等待撤退的日人一共三百萬之多，其中一半是海陸軍人員，海上和鐵路運輸被毀或是陷於停頓，港口的設備損傷也重，而且擁有過多的救濟和其他物資，日人必須被解除武裝，集中然後送至最近的港口。在若干例子中，這裏面的距離是很遙遠的，在港中那裏，日人都逐一受審查和體格檢騐，而且都要施打防疫針，隔離醫院先後在港口成立，以便應付傳染病，如亞洲霍亂等，最後三百萬人都要由海路運回日本。</p>
<p>美國軍隊帮助解除日軍武裝的工作，執行總部和它的小組完成複雜的程序，使日軍能够通過並從內戰區域移至登船港、口，美方隊伍並且參加在港口方面的檢查工作，而美方醫藥單位，則指導一切打針和其他醫藥工作。最後，隸屬第七艦隊的美國和日本船隻，把這很大的人數運到日本的港口，去年末，的有二十萬日人被遣送回國，他們離開中國港口，每日的二千五百人，今年三月，因爲美軍和中國當局的迅速和擴大的努力，日人離華的速率，增至每日二萬人，到十」月爲止，二·九八六·四三八日人，已被遣放返國，而此項計劃也就認爲吿一段落·除了在滿洲若干地點以外數字不明的日人外，所留下的日人，祇是中國政府所保留的留一些戰犯和技術人員。在內戰，交通破壞，和其他困難情形下，這偉大的任務終於完成，將水成中美爲共同目標而合作的卓越例子。</p>
<p>駐華美軍數字大減</p>
<p>各方對去年美軍駐華多有微言。去年秋間，駐華美軍爲數相富多，也應該相當多，誰都不敢預測中國境內日軍服從投降條約將到什麽地步，我們應在時艱聲中派軍協助中國。當事實顯示中國軍隊，已能對付投降日軍時，駐華美軍就立即開始復員。</p>
<p>美軍的主要職責，爲飾助撤退日人，這種工作，因各地環境問題而延長。執行總部和休戰小組也需要大批美籍人士，尤其是因爲重要的無綫電和其他交通工作，幾乎全是美方維持。執行總部設在北平，距離海岸僅一百哩，該城且時有發生地方衝突事件的可能性。因此，美方之另于責任就是保護執行總部的供應綫。日軍投降後美軍的另一任務，爲提供必須之保護，俾使天津東北方之大煤礦所產之煤能抵達海口，以便供應華中各城市和鐵路綫。這種煤斤是防止華中工業區崩潰所必需的，我們的海軍陸戰隊於九月完成這種任務，其他美軍的任務則爲尋覓對日作戰期間在中國陣亡美軍的遺體和墳墓。尙有其他美軍則須守衛美方的設備和配備儲藏庫，並設法運回或以剩餘物資出售之。</p>
<p>一年前駐華美軍的最高實力爲十一禽三千名，今日此項數字已開始减至不及一萬二千名，其中包括直接與執行總部有關之美軍二千名，此項數字更事减少，直至執行部和靑島美軍維持供應和安全所需要之最低數字爲止。</p>
<p>是以，在過去一年內，我們在協助中遣送日人方面已有很多成就，已能撤退大部駐軍返國。我們在協助中國接收收復區方面，也盡了相當的力量·我們曾採取若干經濟援助的緊急步驟，以防止中國經濟崩潰，且已淸理了我們自身在中國的戰時金融賬目。</p>
<p>無意干涉中國內政</p>
<p>中國迄今，未能覓取團結及和平方法，誠是一大憾事。因爲馬帥明白問題的嚴重性和獲致解決方案的重要性，他仍堅守他的崗位，甚至在談判已被中共中斷的情形下，我們將繼續協助中國走向和平和眞正民主的政府。</p>
<p>一年前，本政府所表示的觀點，今日仍不失其眞實性·二月間所同意的政治統一計劃是完善的。四月以來的戰鬥，已使二月間的軍事統一計劃難於實施，惟該計劃內的，一般原則都很完善。　中國是個主權完整的國家。我們承認這個事實，我們也承認中國國民政府。我們繼續希望該政府將覓取一和平解決方案。我們無意干涉中國國內事務。我們的立塲是顯而易見的，在避免被捲入內爭聲中，我們將維持我們協助中國人民爭取國家和平和經濟復興的政策。</p>
<p>我們對於給予中國的創造性援助的方法和工其，都加以審愼和同情的考慮。最近農業使團赴華就是這種援助的一例。美訪華農業圑由加利福利亞大學赫契遜率領，中國並組織一中美農業合作聯合委會，赫契遜使團即爲該委會的一部份。該國的建議已提供興中國政府，我們並準備協助中國實施該建議。當中國的情形改進後，我們已準備考慮協助實施其他無關內爭的計劃。這種計劃將鼓勵中國經濟重建和改革，從而增進中美商務關係。</p>
<p>我們相信我們對中國的希望和中國人民自身的最殷切願望完全符合。以是，我們將持續我們的積極而且切合實際的對　政策這種政策仍　於完全尊重它的國家主權和我們對中國人民的傳統友誼，這種政策的目標並在於促進國際和平。</p>

<h3>國際變幻話蘇聯</h3>
<p>蘇聯的態度，最近已轉趨緩和，至於能否持久，一時尚難斷言，其首初試驗，即在數星期開會之原子能委員會會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕四國外長會議與聯合國機構，在《九四六年十個月又三星期中祇有使人悲觀，每前進一步，輒又後退一步。蘇聯似決心欲將國際會議僅變成宣傅座談會。英首相艾德禮於今夏赴巴黎作最後努力，期望蘇聯合作，但其成效似乎絕少。巴黎會議及最初五星期之紐約會議，似僅加强蘇聯與英語國家間之分裂？迨至四屋期前，蘇聯始漸顯軟化，決定截軍方案一經獲致協議，聆不復要求對於執行機稱之決定有否決權。他如特港問題，多腦河自由通航間題等，亦均表示妥協，且於提議普遍裁軍之後，即將其駐在歐洲佔領區內之大軍開始復員。蘇聯亦嘗承認若干失敗，如謂聯合國機構全體會員對西班牙弗朗哥政府斷絕國交，及調查各國駐外軍隊等，其態度已較前爲佳，並未因此憤而退席。蘇聯又表示願在伊朋亞塞爾拜然省失去其政治地位，而不願以此引起另一糾紛。德里蘭政府決心採取行勁，於數日內未經大戰，已將蘇聯擁護之亞省地方政府與以消滅，使實際上與伊朗其他部份隔絕已久之一省重行開放。蘇聯態度轉變之原因，及其能否持久當然引起許多猜測。一部份聯合國大會代表指出蘇聯之農塲及工廠，需要其作爲軍事外交後盾之軍隊回國工作，五年計劃之進行，需要國外經濟援助，且覺其以前所抱態度，已引起各國反感，於已一無所利，亦有一部份人希望蘇聯外交家因週旋日久，漸覺西方各國更能受人信任。至於蘇聯之新態度能否持久，此一間題，大率視紐約會議時其他各種發展之價值而定，內中最主要者即爲普遍栽軍方案。大會曾請安全理事會決定如何設立管制監察機構及成立聯合國警備軍。蘇聯可以承認美國於公開原子能秘密前所必須獲得之保障，抑或蘇聯過於重視其主權，過於恐懼外人之監察，且過於確信美國在可以預料之時期內，決不會以原子炸彈相　，因而妨　一切必要之行動其首次試驗，即在數星期內開會之原子能委員會議。同時於紐約會議開幕時深藏不露之悲觀空氣，則已一變而爲希望，雖然仍不免受有限制。</p>

<h3>遠東委會準許日本工會活動</h3>

<h3>市政建設捐　擬長期懲收　將于今晨市政會議中提出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市現行徵收之市政建設捐，原係臨時性質。第一次參議，會中會決定，若明年度市財政情形好轉時，須另謀開源之法，廢除市政建設捐。現據記者向有關方面探悉：市財政局因鑒於本市經濟情形，一時恐難充裕，故擬參照財政收支系統法中之規定，將市政建設捐列入特別課稅收人項中，俾能長期征收，以維市政。聞財局將於今晨之市政會議中　出，通過後再提請第二次市參議會審議。</p>

<h3>錢天鶴自美返滬　暢談世界糧食局　我對小麥會議亦表歡迎</h3>
<p>農林部决長錢天鶴，今年五月中句奉派出國，會先後出席聯合國糧食農業組織會議，五月十九日在華府召開之緊急糧食會議，及九月二日在丹麥舉行之第二次年會，事後並遍遊歐美各地，考察戰後生產及復原狀況，錢氏已於前日由美乘機飛返滬，昨晨在農林部滬辦事處接見記者，談此行經過及感想稱：本人抵倫敦時，曾晤及聯合國糧食農業組織會總幹事何約翰會士，何氏當即面促吾國理事早日首途，參加會議，及返抵華府，恰值聯合國農業組織邀請各國代表開會，討論成立世界糧食局事宜，該局成立意義，係因世界產糧國家，可分爲過剩與不足兩種，前者認爲目前雖感普遍供應不足，但不出二三年後，世界糧食恐有過剩趨勢，屆時糧價下降，互成競爭因素，有此組織，可以預防糧價慘跌，同時，該局對於缺糧國家，扶助其糧食生產，提高其人民營養水準，如逢世界糧食過剩時，該局撥款購糧存儲，糧價上漲時則拋售存糧，抑平價格，如此可使糧價穩定，無暴漲暴跌之弊，其缺糧國家亦得源源接濟，無　饉之虞，其意固善，情乎多糧國家。如美，加，澳，及阿根廷等，對此並不感興趣，以爲上項組織範圍廣泛，寗願就每　糧食，個別組織，認爲比較適合。例如最近在華府召開世界小麥會議，其辦法係由各會員國家，共同商定此後四年中世界小麥最高及最低市價，一經協定成立，則在此四年中世界小麥買賣，不得超越此最高及最低價格範圍之外，使將來小麥過剩時，出口國家獲得銷路對象，至缺糧國家，亦不虛匱乏，且該會組織單純，易收成效，職是之故，。述糧食出口國家，及糧食進口主要國家，對於此項組織，自較前者重視，甚至反對世界糧貪之組織，但以我國立場爲出發點，對小麥會議，固屬歡迎，面對世界糧食局之設立，亦寄以莫大希望，因該局之組設，對我國整個農業建設，實有莫火幫助也。</p>

<h3>中美醫院工潮　院長發表經過　一度發生怠工　糾紛迄未解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中美合作社主持之中美醫院，自今秋經蔣主席手諭發還同濟大學後，即由同濟大學與中美醫院負責人會商接洽，於十一月廿八日簽訂合的，開始接收。接收工作正在進行之際，該院工人向院方提出要求五項：並於本月十六日起全體實行怠工。該院院長沈銜書特於昨日招待新間界，報告接收情形，與比次工人怠工之經過。其談話內容如下：中美醫院自蔣主席手諭發還同濟火學後，即將中美合作社主持之醫院，改爲同濟大學之附屬醫院。唯中美醫院創立之始，中美合作社會用去大量資金，從事裝修與改造，故此次接收後，一切應付未付款項與銀行透支，悉由同濟大學負責償還。該院原有之醫師，於明年六月聘的期滿，而同濟火學方面，爲便利該校學生到院實習起見，將請本校敎授講師等，充當該院醫師‘原有之醫師，照原橷發新三月，實行解約。又醫院之接收工作，非同於普通機關之接收，對於院中病人，必須照常服務，且此次醫院改組後，已失去原有之獨立性，一切經費之舉措與人事之更動，必須轉呈同濟大學核准，方得施行，而工人隨於此時向院方提出五點要求：（一）調整待遇，以底橷卅二元照生活指數發給。（二）保陣工人生話，不得無故解僱。（三）發給冬季制服。（四）改善食宿。（五）年底發給雙橷。院方以此次工人提出請求，未經合法手續，故院方即對工人表示，應派正式代表，前來接洽，所提請求，可代爲轉呈同濟大學，核定可否。工人獲得此項答覆後，並米派造代表，反於十六日起實行怠工，全院電梯停駛，拒送病人飯食，並於墻壁及院中車輛上，張貼標語；且欲將車輛開出。院方乃緊鎖院門，禁止出入，怠工期間，院方曾接得同徳，南洋，上海時疫等十三醫院之來函，請照准工人之請求，使工潮早日解決，俾免牽動其他各醫院之工人，發生同樣事件。院方則以中美醫院旣爲同濟大學之附屬醫院，一切須候同濟大學核准。且該院工人之待遇，爲十二萬元，供膳宿，較之其他醫院，已屬優厚。與同濟大學之職工相較，更相差甚遠，故工人所提之請求，須待同濟校長返滬後，再行決定。</p>
<p>昨請社局調處</p>
<p>另據大公社訊：中美醫院之工潮，發生以來，已有四日，迄今未見解決。在十六日晨間，一度曾發生怠工狀態後，隨又恢復。但職工一一八人所提之四項要求，院方迄未答覆。十六日晨職工會推代表四人往見沈院長要求答覆，但院長未接見，僅由事務主任吳松茂轉言，口頭答覆，對於職工所提第一條底薪改爲三十二元一節，以同濟職工橷水祗六萬六，而今中美職工巳十二萬元，故不宜再加。第二條改進膳宿一項，在舊院長丁伯雄時會允職工於今冬設法，因適企改組，故再度向新院長提出，院方之答覆，亦以房屋不夠，亦不能答允。性膳食一項，或可以私人關係，設法酌予改茶。第一條添製冬季制服一項，則以經費關係，不能照辦。對於第四條職業保障一項，則可辦到。當時全體職工認爲仍不能滿意，所以一度怠工。後經警局派員解釋，應顧全病人，故即復工，繼續談判。昨職工已呈請社會局調處，延至昨晚爲止，仍未見解決。聞今晨全市十七家醫院已決定各推代表二人往社會局請願。</p>

<h3>保護國產水泥防止外貨傾銷經濟部已採取有效措置</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國水泥工業於抗戰期間被敵强佔摧毀，損失慘重。勝利以後又因資金缺乏成本昂貴運輸困難外貨傾銷等因素，產銷陷入困境。月前中華水泥工業聯合會曾迭向行政院經濟部財政部等機關呼籲救濟，茲悉經濟部於調查詳細情形後，業已採取保護國產水泥工業之有效措施，其詳細辦法如下：（一）呈請行政院通令各機關對於建設所需水泥一律改用國產不得有採購洋貨情事。（二）咨請交通部，對於國產水泥之運銷特予設怯改進。（三）對於工人怠工罷工及干涉廠万管理權等情形山主管官署嚴予制止，工人底薪非經主管機關核准不得任意增加。（四）爲防止外貨傾銷，已由財政部飭交國定稅則委員會考慮增改水泥進口稅率。（五）水泥工業所需之煤斤由燃料委員會仍維原價分配以使成本减低。（六）水泥工業所需貨款可依照修正四聯總處核辦投姿貼放方針向就近四聯分支處申請。</p>
<p>外貨進口·要求禁止</p>
<p>此項辦法如能確實施行，水泥工業情形自可大爲改善。惟該業因鑒於外貨傾銷最爲嚴重，故已進一步向輸入臨時管理委員會申請禁止外貨水泥進口，因國產水泥品質向來不下於外貨，且估計目下全國各水泥廠生產能力，每年可達二千一百萬桶以上，足敷國內一切需要而有餘。此外，水泥運銷國內，貨物稅局規定須於每一包上黏貼印照，窒礙難行。該業會迭電稅務署准予免貼，現悉業經立法案通過云。</p>
<p>各水泥廠·定購新機</p>
<p>按現時全國水泥工廠除上海水泥公司集於七”間停工外，其餘啓新洋灰公司中國水泥公司華新水泥公司華北水泥公司西村水泥廠太原水泥廠四川水泥公司及資源委員會接收敵產後成立之台灣水泥公司東九省各水泥廠等均在積謀發展，華新水泥廠並擬以國幣六百億元南京之江南水泥公司亦擬以美金一百六十二萬元定購最新機械之。</p>
<p>又悉最近數月來國產水泥因成本增加，售價亦巳略增，至於美國水泥因海員罷工故進口較少，但於工潮解決後已有三十一萬包運來，現已抵達吳淞口外即將進口云。</p>
<h3>公教人員配售處三門市部明開業</h3>
<p>毛毯四萬五千五百元</p>
<p>上海市公敎人員物品配售處，近爲改進配售業務，便利公敎人員購物起見，特設立第一門市部於福州路二百號，專售物資供應局供應之各項日用品，第二門市部於乍浦路三五五號，第三門市部於江西路一入〇號都城飯店內，銷售一般零星日用物品，均定於明日開始營業，據該處負責人稱：凡執有配購證之公教人員，須先憑配購證往各門市部索取門市部配售登記表，以便交易·至毛毯一項，則由第一門市部直接配售，各公激人晨可　帶配　　及宙字配購票（票後須　號碼並蓋用印鑑），憑票購買，每條定價四萬五千五百元，依次出售，至售完爲止。</p>
<h3>民營農場登記後得請求低利貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局在惟勗科長告記者：本市民營農塲登記，社會局前己通告限期申請辦理，嗣因晨林部將前頒農塲登記規則加以修正，社局奉令後即擬訂農塲登記須知一種，並將各項表格分別印妥，並規定自明年元旦至一月底，爲已成立民營農塲登記之期，過此不再補登。對於民營農塲本身，登記後有兩項重大利益：（一）可向中國農民銀行請求低利貸款，利率僅爲四分，時間依農塲之性質而定。（二）可得政府之技術指導及物質補助。例如社會局己配得美國蔬菜種子，但因農塲未登記，故無法分配。同時農林部已配得美國之滅蟲器，對於農塲之預防蟲災，亦大有裨益。目前經營農塲，相當有利。例如種植菜蔬，培養鮮花，及豢養家畜等，均有利可圖。惟亦有兩個前提：一爲不論種花養鷄，必須選擇良種，太普通者銷路不大。一一爲農塲之經營，必須爲新式管理，同時此亦爲中農借款之先決條件。</p>

<h3>銀行今日結帳封關金價前途仍看漲美鈔港票昨均被帶高</h3>
<p>烚赤昨對休假仍存　望，低後即期，晨開三三三萬五，自三三一萬五起，逐漸回穩，一經轟動，不久即回升至三三九萬，始有壓力，略起回風，央行以三三七萬之價，配給三八條，十時光景在三三七萬左右徘徊，後以證券方面之游資再來哄抬，供源暫止，遂穿出三四〇萬外，再升至三四三萬，始在央行供給之下，轉呈徘徊，午刻在三四〇萬內外掙扎，午後因目關之故隔日交易，暫停開做，零星交易仍站三四一萬左右，結果較前收漲六萬，飾金三六萬，銀元再昂，暗拆銀根尚平，暗息仍在一角二至一角半。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦被帶高，美鈔門市仍有行無市，暗市巾自六二〇〇元至六四〇〇元起，午刻漲爲六四〇〇至六六〇〇元，午後平靜無變，結果較前收回升二〇〇元，港票昨尚見秀色，稍彼拉高，結果校前收亦好三十元，港匯稍有回小，爲一二三〇元至一二五〇元，成交不多，印匯一五〇〇元至一五二〇元，英匯二〇〇〇〇元至二〇二〇〇元之間，成交未見開展。</p>
<h3>大戶乘機出籠華股欲漲又止</h3>
<p>華股昨欲泓又止，高價時有大戶乘美亞漲停之際出（籠，於是檯面驟形鬆動，市況倍形恍惚，晨開尚平，開後雖有二一二號等來進，但不久即有一八〇號一〇五號七一號一六〇號一九七號二一五號一八六號等陸續供售，逐步下游，低價時遞永紗見六二〇元，一九九號力進不已，一九八號一四五號八三號七六號竿亦購，二三四號八五號等補空不已，十時半，美亞經一四五號購買而告漲停，遞永紗遂盤漲到六八一元，此後大戶乘亂，在塲外出籠，廣帮逢高有售而回，一九七號七六號一三三號八九號三六號咸售，而告越低，中途屢有起仆，無奈簿碼見鬆，易跌難升，七六號一九八號一〇六號三六號一再脫售，午刻復見怯疲，但收後喊價見昂，結果較前收計永紗信和景福新光華豐均跌，勤興美亞微升，冷股火柴跌落一成，餘者升降不一，遞交永紗信和新光華豐微降，美亞稍升，午後承前收後之餘勢，上塲即形爭買，開高十餘元，二一二號二一一號連袂有買，而升至六大〇元外，一九九號一八〇號三八號一七號均售回低至六五〇元內，惟此時二一二號不時有購，七六號二一一號亦進，遞永紗遂升爲六六三元，一九八號三八號八九號一七七號不時供售，八九號一六二號更售現永紗，掙扎至三時後，始感萎靡，曾回落至午收價光景，臨收轉盤，惟收後喊價又見抬高，結果較前收計永紗美亞勤興微升，信和景福平平，新光華豐稍降，冷股火柴跌一成，內衣新亞升一成內外，餘者升降俱微，遞交各股計永紗新光華豐微挫，美亞信和微升，塲外各股毫無變動。</p>

<h3>公債呆定</h3>
<p>公債昨呆滯若定，毫無活動可言，統丙晨開一三七〇元，曾微挫至一三四〇元，而後回高至一四〇〇兀結束，與前收相較並無榮辱，甲乙亦平，統丁小二十元，統戊微挫十元，成交不過數十萬元。</p>
<h3>廠絲繼續扳高</h3>
<p>廠絲市況活躍，人心振奮，持貨者類皆看高而扳價，故昨日D字等級比上日又做大十萬元，普通絲亦皆跟高，干經昨市尚稱平穩，站住原盤，昨市人造絲因塲中供多於求，遂告疲落，一二〇號有光老裝天橋，三百九十五萬元售出，以致新裝亦喊小五萬元，東洋牌子做三百三十八萬元，比上日小五萬元，高山牌子做三十五萬元，比上日小三萬元，其餘半兀及一五〇號有光，因貨稀而喊價堅定，綢貨以格十璧縐最俏，八千四百元有成交，被面仍喊八十五萬元，不過缺乏受主，盛貨昨亦提高的每疋一千至二千元之譜。</p>

<h3>茶市外強中乾</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，陳祁門，市勢續靜，惟平水頭號陳珠茶，出口行頗有需要，尤以午昌茶葉公司爲最來者不拒，惜市上存底寥若晨星，故售價異常堅穩，又悉汪裕泰茶號對於炒靑毛茶亦在搜羅，以便複製外銷茶云。</p>
<h3>土布營業稅明年起免徵</h3>
<p>財政部爲獎勵土布生產，規定自卅六年一月起，除銷售商外，免徵土布營業稅，聞本市財政局及直接稅局已奉到上項命令，茲將土布免稅標準探誌如下：（一）以人力用手搖機，拉機或脚踏機織成之製造業爲限，（二）以手紋布斜紋布爲限，織有條子格子者均包括在內，（三）以土紗織成者爲主，但如用機紗織者，其單紗不得逾十六支，（四）不限長度及寬度，（五）不限本色及染色。</p>
<h3>呢羢祇有零銷</h3>
<p>呢羢市面，近因齊受高利貸壓迫，本街客埠又續有倒閉講賬等事實演出，兼之國曆年底，轉瞬將屆，買賣雙方成有戒心，同時舶來品源源到申，人心因之萎疲，所有標準始終平疲，市塲上及一般大批發號家，祗有零星銷路，除美貨麥爾登外，絕少原箱整疋買賣云。</p>
<h3>平抑燒堿市價　社會局與卜內門在磋商中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卜內門公司業務部經理史梯亞氏，於昨日赴社會局與經濟行政處趙科長會商拋售存碱及平抑市價問題；社會局方面之各項詢問，公司擬於下星期一提出正式之書面答覆。據英方之意見，卜內門對本市燒碱之供應，並不居於舉足輕重之地位。根據其搜集之統計數字，本年之內，卜內門進口三千五百噸，香港方面進口一一九六噸，菲律賓方面運來一五一八噸，來自美國者三六八八噸；是則卜內門所供給者，僅有三分之一强。至於化工原料市價之趨勢，有關人士指出目前市價之波動，言因由於來源不夠，而進口貿易之種種限制，亦與此有關。例如最近有化學原料一批，抵埠已近一月，但因申請入口未准，至今未能報關卸貨。惟化工原料價格之上漲自有其限度，否則代替品將被迫採用，例如以燒碱而言，凈碱即能代替</p>
<h3>紅礬·矽酸鈉漲風尖銳</h3>
<p>紅礬前雖由美國禁止出口，但本市存底甚厚，故價格不見波動，已達半年之久，茲以紅礬鉀。紅礬納，存底已薄，兼以製造阿尼林油，紅礬爲不可或缺之主要原料，而阿尼林油，久無進口，目前全恃國產品供給，加以近日染廠搜求頗殷，故紅礬俏俐非凡，紅礬鉀鈉，價亦跟漲，紅礬鉀每磅價由二·四〇〇元漲至四。七〇〇元，紅礬鈉每磅由八〇〇元漲至四·二〇〇元，又矽酸納（又名泡化　）近日肥皂廠搜求頗力，每磅價格由一四〇元漲至三五〇元，尚無現貨，查矽酸鈉，本市有大華等廠製造，前以美貨進口，質美價廉，價格無法維持成本，（查國產泡化碱每磅成本爲四五〇元，美貨僅一五〇元），早已停造，而美貨存底已空，各方搜購頗力，故漲勢甚不可遏。</p>
<h3>洋松大漲</h3>
<p>木材市況，洋松上漲，因方子實銷頗多，存底亦薄，金鈔告漲之時，適得其機，市氣已出千元關外，其餘木材價亦堅穩。</p>
<h3>米市先漲後回油餅雜糧挺秀</h3>
<p>米市南北共到九千餘石，消化早市甚活，午時轉懈，形成先漲後回，結果南北粳均軋升千元，白元去胃甚暢，續漲二千元，秈米仍然穩定，麵粉胃清懈豆化尚可，依然挺硬，價漲三四百元，麩皮亦昻百元，黃豆趨勢仍居平軟之狀，外埠去化不動，油廠納胃冷落，彔豆南洋頗貧，市而堅固，虹豆油頭續進，再高千元，赤豆高貨本街見濃，略漲三四百元，中下平平，苞米靑島進胃蟬聯，到不敵銷，逐步挺進，再加千餘元，豆餅南洋船位已滿，交易淸懈，回低百元，小麥來源不接，市化香燥，步漲千元，油市店胃轉暢，生油回升三四千元，豆油亦加二三千元，蔴油帶挺，惟淸油廠方求脫甚多，回低二三千元。</p>
<h3>配貨貶價求售紗市一落千丈</h3>
<p>昨日紗市一落干丈，客幫以內地銷滯價疲，迄少動辦，面今次紡管會配售於複製品工廠及零售商之紗綫，復大量在市塲上削價求售，一時籌碼充沛，人心虛軟，廿支雙馬草包價祇二百萬，金城亦祇二百另四五萬，的較前日跌五萬至十萬，前旬缺俏之四十二支雙股錢，亦因織廠獲有配貨，私相轉售，現貨供應不多，亦降十餘萬元。</p>
<h3>紡管會交換意見新方案尚未定局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會於昨日下午四時，在市政府會議室召開例會，迄六時許始告散會。席問對政府所提供之六點處理棉紗方案，（最重要之三點已見昨日本報）交換意見頗詳。據吳兼主委國楨於會後語記者，會議經過，尚未獲有定論。原則上雖已有若干協議之點，惟技術及細則方面，尚待研究。最後定論，尚待呈交宋院長核定後，方能施行云。</p>
<p>又據悉：政府方面此次所提出之六點方案，係經宋院長與關係人士歷决商討，彙集意見後，所得之結論。該六點方案，業已較宋院長最初所定之方案爲緩和云。</p>
<h3>糖價緊秀</h3>
<p>昨糖市以人心看好，納胃增旺，雖值公司標售之期，漲勢仍不稍衰，但標價並無更動，公會劃盤現貨中砂白十四萬七千元，升二千餘元，生砂赤十二萬七千元，升二千元，廣幫潤德靑亦回升三四千元，高九萬七八千元，以决爲九萬四五六千元，薄片靑八萬五六千元，成交千餘件，興化幫開貢粉白十四萬八千元至五千元，普通十三萬七八千元，升度近萬元，明京赤十四萬五千元至二三千元，十四萬元，成交二千餘簍。刁靑零星開十萬〇五千元，升五千元。</p>
<h3>洋紙漲勢力銳利</h3>
<p>洋紙近一週來，普通上漲三成以上，尤以透明紙上漲幾達一倍，其原因爲香煙廠搜購殷切，該項紙張爲奢侈品類，進口困難，故漲勢之勁，似不可遏。</p>
<h3>進出口業務分組研究進口貨物數額分配</h3>

<h3>煤價仍見高昂</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤各貨喊價依然高昻，然供戲均覓情怠。煤塊焦作實銷均佳，市氣挺秀，煤球原料已有到貨，並各廠將獲配貨，市况稱轉鬆動，但且前行市禾肯廉售，木柴及炭均因謀價高昂，各店門銷矚總，行市盧之喊高。</p>
<h3>申請進口釬商下週可公佈名單</h3>

<h3>皂燭火柴創空前高價</h3>
<p>皂燭火柴製造原料不敷實需，生產率銳减，製造廠出貨有限，實需者各向市塲搜購，供求失衡，兼又執貨者居奇，市勢猛挺，昨市各級貨均創空前高價，固本皂挺一萬一千，箭刀皂升八千元，美麗火柴狂十萬元，見七三萬高峯，洋燭亦多帶升。</p>

<h3>國貨南銷困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國對南洋之貿易，數月來毫無進展，以出口而論，最大之問題爲國貨成本大高，而當地購買力太薄弱，故出口商掃興而返者頗不乏人。同時運輸工具之缺乏，更使國貨南銷困難。以進口品而論，過去橡膠椰子油等來貨尚多，但自進口許可制宣佈後，情況已大有變化，因南洋來貨中，在進口貨物表上，大部爲列於二級三級之商品，申請入口許可費時，進口量頗受影饗。補救之道，治本爲提高生產效率，以减抵國貨成本，治標則爲簡化手緻，以利進口；此外如爭取僑胞之協助，亦爲當務之急。</p>
<h3>鋼骨貨稀價堅</h3>
<p>本市竹節鋼用度甚廣，因國外來貨稀少，致日來價格日趨堅昂，聞最近已抵滬埠外輪，曾有到貨若干噸，俟申請許可手續辦竣後即可提貨，價格可望轉穩云。</p>

<h3>昨足球友誼賽　復旦戰和環球　結果二比二平分秋色</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市環球體育會足球隊，與復旦大學足球隊，昨日午後三時半，假復旦球塲舉行友誼比賽，裁判王南珍，巡邊員，陳景處，儲劍弘。復旦隊長錢長榮缺席，王和生調前，後陣頗爲空處，加以寒風刺骨，攻守均不激烈，結果以二比二與環球平分秋色。</p>
<p>戰況</p>
<p>戰況經過如下：笛聲嚮處，角逐開始，復旦攻勢頻頻，三分鐘時，中鋒空軍健將王定球（按彼爲復旦同學唯一之現役空軍），帶球直人，突過環球後衛封鎖綫，猛然一射，球稍偏碰柱彈回，飛腿范嗣傑趕上一脚，首開紀錄。環球中鋒王福山，怒從心起，輾轉之際，一蹴命中，扳爲平手，上半時一比一，</p>
<p>易陣再戰，復旦王和生調至左內翼，後陣益加空虛，爲環球王義山所乘，鵠中一球，環球遂以二比一領先。復旦見勢不佳，攻勢益緊，奈環球後衛，朱成福，守陣極嚴，每見化險爲夷。一一十分鐘時，王和生高球飛中，王定球傅左，范嗣傑得機猛蹴，再建一功。雙方遂入混戰之局，結果件無所獲，二比二終局。雙方陣容如下：</p>
<p>（復且）</p>
<p>張志榮　黃剛維　劉開國　項覇　王和生　徐陵　范嗣傑　何明壁　王定球　任家桂　錢家駒</p>

<h3>青白在港最後之戰　足球勝港聯籃球隊敗北</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕十六日，靑白足球隊以一球之勝，打倒港聯，完成了他們在港的戰程。靑白這次勝利，眞是贏得徼倖。靑白來港半月，賽至這最後一塲，已經入馬疲乏，走的走，傷的傷，幾有組軍不威之勢，結果拉來了聖方濟隊老將福斯，勉强出塲，幸而後衛綫還是一樣的堅强，而秦必高似乎越來越見精神抖擻，結果總算把港聯擊敗了。</p>
<p>加山之上　球迷零落</p>
<p>港中球迷，眼看靑白的本領「已蓋於斯」，熱鬧心情，大不如前，昨日加山之上，頓形冷落，靑白一行人馬，今早乘車赴省，準備作兩塲比賽，一對市警，一對強華，計程廿日返港，屆時或再來一塲滬聯對港聯比賽，但因球迷興趣大减，那塲能否演出，尚難逆料。</p>
<p>籃球觀衆　香得膩了</p>
<p>籃球方面，靑白倒給港聯擊敗了。十五日、港聯以三十二對廿三破靑白，當日靑白僅以一分之差，擊敗港中籃球盟主的自力時，有經騐的觀衆，便　靑白難逃最後的厄運。綜觀這回港滬足籃球賽，一共九塲，我們不由不慨嘆我國體育人材的缺乏，打來打去總是那些人馬，甚至觀衆，也看得膩了，其體育價值，更不必說，所以戰後我們的體育方案，亟須打倒過去的「英雄主義」，而從普遍的培植新興人才下手。</p>
<p>靑白對港聯之戰，雙方出塲人馬如下：</p>
<p>靑白隊</p>
<p>秦必高　嚴士鑫　吳祺祥　翟永福　孟義良　高保正　曹秋亭　張金海　宋靈聖　福思</p>
<p>港華聯</p>
<p>朱兆恒　李國威　霍耀華　羅　權　梁榮照　孔慶煜　李碩友　鄒文治　陳德輝　馮景祥　何應芬</p>
<p>一球之勝　擊敗港聯</p>
<p>打了半塲，雙方供無建樹，港聯前鋒活躍，頻頻向靑白進攻，靑白穩紮穩打，力却强敵，秦必高此時有佳妙的演出，鄒文治李碩友和何應芬，多次猛射，都給他的妙手救出。</p>
<p>下半塲靑白較爲得勢，前鋒綫上，張金海之衝刺，宋靈聖之花巧，羅壽福之奔走全塲，曹秋亭之急走急傳，均各有其獨到之妙。所以開塲不及七分鐘，羅壽福得了一球，單刀赴會，華聯門將離門外出，便敎球兒流入網去。這一球若非霍耀華與朱兆恒兩人的誤會，實在負不得。靑白以如此偶然機會，而護勝，可見並非球藝上的卓絕成功，假如這種勝利，靑白因此而踌躇目滿，我國足球隊在國際上的地位，也許更爲沒落了！</p>
<p>民政簡報</p>

<h3>一夜狂歡話聖誕</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>十年前，舞廳對於聖誕節的到來是期望甚股的。因爲平時清淡的生意，在那天可以獲得客滿的保證。所以，本來的舞廳都打扮起來了，屋頂上掛滿了棉花做成的雪，當中繫着一堆氣球，樂隊的背景釘着恭祝聖誕的字樣。此外，舞塲老闆還爲顧客裝好了一網袋一網袋的玩具，紙帽，哨子，洋娃娃……道裏象徵了聖誕老人在大雪紛飛中，捎了一大袋禮物，由烟囱管裏滑下，分送給那些一善良的人們。</p>
<p>我們還不能忘記舞聽裏的聖誕大菜，出色的火鷄，芬芳的香檳酒……舞女們也預備了新裝，爲酬答外國老闆的恩典，在舞廳里預定了聖誕大菜。</p>
<p>這一夜，舞聽到同鄕會中去借來了許多桌椅，容納那一年中稀有擁擠的舞客。雖然是桌椅擺滿了，擁來的人潮，那些穿着禮服的紳士淑女，往往聳聳他們的肩胛，表示得不到位置。</p>
<p>看吧！這情形叫寒在抖索在門外朔風中得不到聖誕老人禮物的乞丐無法想像的。水汀開得比陽光還熱，烟霧騰空，猶如蒸氣一樣。僕歐用他的經騐，把香檳酒撲的開嚮了。紳士洋大班們呷酒的狂態就跟美國電影上所表現出來的一樣。洋琴鬼得到了犒賞，穿着禮服，敲得特別起勁。但來自四面的紛亂的哨子聲，叫爵士樂獎了質。座位上不留一個舞女了，運過老過少的也被搶刧一空。這樣，就把一小塊舞池擠得水洩不通，像非洲森林中的螞蟻羣，看不出是整體的泥塊，還是在那兒蠕動的流沙。</p>
<p>爲了第二天好在朋友面前誇耀起見，那些呷了過多的洋酒的人們，便僱了汽車翻到第二家，第三家……舞廳裏去玩。這樣，一直玩到天明，他們才橫躺在車廂裏，啍着洋歌回去了。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，上海的洋人都被驅到敵人的拘留所里去。買辦改業囤貨，投機。行員也自貶身價，跑跑單帮。於是這洋氣十足的　誕節便冷落得很。第一套禮服破了，再沒有力量去做第二套。舞廳裏雖然備有聖誕大菜，人們對於火鷄却並不感到興趣。穿絲棉袍子的主顧踏進了被日本人拆去了水汀管子的舞廳，只是佔據一角，用淸茶來代替了香擯。日本人的大皮鞋，畢竟比烏亮削尖薄皮的漆皮鞋子差多了。生啤酒把日本人灌飽了，在舞塲裏橫衡豎撞，那裏再能夠結成整整的人塊。</p>
<p>但是敎會學校裏的學生未能忘情於這西洋趣味，他們往往三五成羣，在家庭裏舉行聖誕「派對」。小客廳地板上摩上了滑粉，聖誕樹上紮滿了紅綠小燈泡，開了電唱機，再用無綫電幫忙，一樣可以跳得很興奮。</p>
<p>現在，是勝利後第二個聖誕節，快要到臨了。洋大班從集中營出來已久，加上大量的花旗兵，聖誕前夜的盛況，一定又要復興了。</p>
<p>是的，各舞廳都在計劃着了：菜單，節目，贈品…，準備給顧客們一宵的狂歡！</p>
<p>但是，十年前的盛况，一時不能復活了。靠洋人吃飯的進口行都吃了大虧，百業更是凋零不堪，有誰會興冲冲地製禮服，去參加那火鷄大宴呢？</p>
<h3>聖誕誌奇</h3>
<p>當天飛大雪·明年必大熟</p>
<p>黎明發大風·六畜盡遭殃</p>
<p>夜來燈光亮·可以消災難</p>
<p>蟋蟀上爐架·大家喜若狂</p>
<p>世界各國，都免不了迷信的舉動，而西方人對於聖誕節，迷信事件更是「五花八門」。</p>
<p>今年的聖誕節是星期三——嚇！聖誕節逢到星期三，據說就大大的不祥！據他們的說怯，今年將非常地冷，並且有颶風，明年還有戰事發生，各地疫癘橫行，火山爆裂，隨處都有天災人禍，而且……嗨嗨！你相信不相信？</p>
<p>聖誕節那天的天氣，據說也有關明年的吉兇禍福，正如我國人傳說農歷元旦天下雨，這一年出門就不吉利一樣。他們的說法是這檬的：如遇聖誕前夕，月明星稀，那很好，明年定然瓜果大熟，活價便宜。假使是烏雲蔽月，或者來一陣傾盆大雨，那可糟了，吃不到瓜果，也喝不到酒了。耶誕那天最好下大雪，明歲定是年成大熟。白天天色陰沈沈地，明歲麥子可卜豐年，否則一定擬收。天黑可以拿到多量牛奶一天明鷄鴨生產必多。黎明時若有大風，鷄鴨牛猪六畜，恐將遭殃。聖誕日如有雷電，天必奇寒，但是明年工商各界，却可獲利甚豐。自朝至暮，日光和煦，那麼明年安穩度日，無災無難。不過日沒時如有黑雲遮日，明年春夏兩季，將有疫癘蔓延，假如還加上了一陣狂風，明年人口，必然死亡枕藉，不堪設想！</p>
<p>一個西方人的家裏，在聖誕前夕總是鼓舞歡欣，澈底熱鬧。所有的燈光，燭光，電光，全都點亮，因爲在他們看來，光亮是可以消滅大災大難。有的人家把一根多節的木棒，掛在牆壁上面，用火來燃燒，於是闔家人坐着，「唸唸有詞」地祝福。大家希望這一根木棒能夠燒完，那麼明年大小事件，一定可以稱心如意。</p>
<p>聖誕的前夕，不無掃興的是竟有許多妖魔鬼怪，也在這夕光臨，其中最多的是「自殺鬼」，趁道時候，找尋「主願」。「他們」往往在十二點鐘以前，在人間散佈着罪惡的種子。但是，你最好在十二時以前，索性把窗戶完全關放，以示「歡迎」，那麼也許會受到「他們」的饒恕，最忌的是：你皀窗戶緊閉，那些妖魔鬼怪更應加來找你麻煩。</p>
<p>耶誕那天，最先進門的東西，以靑色爲最好，最先進門的人，最好是男子，因爲男性先進門，據說可以帶進幸福來，就是貓狗玄牲，也最好是雄的先進門。</p>
<p>耶誔時最吃香的動物，一是蟋蟀，二是公雞。因爲西方人以爲蟋蟀携帶幸福種子最多。如果火爐上跳上一頭蟋蟀，一家人定然大喜若在，聖誕夜的公雞，如果能夠整夜的啼呌，預卜明年一定豐收。</p>
<p>年輕的女郎，如果希望她的未婚夫，在聖誕夜和她在夢中相會，只須臨睡吃幾個黑鷄生的蛋，倘使恐怕夢短情長，興猶米盡，那麼先把鷄蛋煮透，去掉了蛋黃，拌入貪監而食。如果此怯毫不靈騐，一個夢也沒有？那你活該！</p>
<p>神話和傳說，還有很多哩！室內裝飾的冬靑，不能太光滑，太光滑了，明年將有不幸事件。又不能太組糙，如果太粗糙了，夫妻情感將趨不睦。婦人在預備祭聖物品時，烘培果子麵包，萬不能使它碎裂，否則這婦人將活不到明年的聖誕節。皮革物件在聖誕節是不能帶進門的，因爲皮革會帶進不幸的種子。燒炭的時候，赤足或眇目的人是切忌進門的，尤其是脚背太胖的女人。晚上爐裏的炭火最好能妥爲保存，那麼「祝融」先生將不會在明年一年中光臨了。</p>
<p>眞太多了，記不勝記。你如果有興，不妨去問問旅華西僑，他們有沒有如上的舉動？</p>

<h3>冬至大如年</h3>
<p>外國人在聖誕節的習俗，跟中國人在冬至日的禮節，在原則上相仿佛。</p>
<p>中國人老喜歡把聖誔節呌作「外國冬至」，因爲外國人在聖誕節的習俗和國人在冬至節的習俗，在原則上完全相彷彿。何以言之？因兩者都因循着祖宗相傳的神說和禮節，包含着古代民族節季的遊樂故也！</p>
<p>寫聖誕節的文字，固然是應時文章，但究嫌滿紙「洋」氣過濃，這裏，就寫一些本國的冬至吧，聊示不忘「國粹」。</p>
<p>畫短　夜最長</p>
<p>「冬至大如年」，這句土話差不多是婦孺皆知的，蘇人亦有「肥冬瘦年」的話，滬諺尚有：「乾晴冬至濕淡年，熱鬧冬至冷淡年。」這後一句也與「冬至大如年」的意義相同。這話的來歷，大槪是這樣的：</p>
<p>先就天文學觀點上說，地球環繞太陽，自西向東，沿黃道前淮，當太陽光綫直射在南回歸錢上，便長北半球冬至的時候。這一天白　最短，黑夜最長。過了這一天，太陽又開始向北移動，日晷漸次增長。古人將太陽比皇帝，於是有「冬至陽氣起，君道長」的附會。因爲「君道長」於是又有「冬至大朝會慶賀」的儀注。其禮節與正月元旦無異，而民問也就有祭祀祖先，拜賀尊長，穿新衣服，交相揖謁等俗禮，名之爲「拜冬」。</p>
<p>拜冬　舊習俗</p>
<p>這「拜冬」的習俗在漢代已有了，流傳到上海，大槪是在宋室南渡的時候。秦榮光的「上海縣竹枝詞」上描寫冬至節的上海土俗云：</p>
<p>「冬至花糕更粉圓分冬酒吃鬧年年，衣冠拜賀親朋後，肉塊堆盤夜祀先。」</p>
<p>上海人往往在冬至前一夕，磨粉製花糕粉圓，作爲祀先告冬的物品。秦乃歌雜凑說：「冬至送糕年送粉，不來親者也來親。」可見糕粉等不僅自用，尚須餽贈親友。</p>
<p>前夕　祀祖先</p>
<p>正如聖誕之前夕一樣，中國冬至的前夕，名爲「冬除夕」，也是夠算熱鬧，大家小戶，無不辦飮食祭祀祖先，各家更迭邀請飲宴，喚做「分冬酒」。「怯華鄕志」載：「冬至隔宵，稱冬至夜，祀先食肉」。「松江府志」也載：「十一月冬至，治花糕，封羊豕，祀先。』祀必有肉，死了的祖宗神靈是不會吃肉的，這肉自然是等到祀後一家人分而大嚼。滬諺有「冬至夜呌一塊肉，譬如不冬至。』在有肉可吃的時候，而僅僅吃到一塊，只好以譬如「不冬至」，聊以自嘲了。</p>
<p>冬朝　拜尊長</p>
<p>冬朝，士大夫家向例是冠帶相賀，拜謁尊長。即使是引車賣漿之流，也是換了新衣，揚揚過市，遇見熟人，互相揖候。</p>
<p>今年冬至是農曆十一月二十九日，國曆十二月二十二日，比「外國冬至」佔前了三天！</p>
<h3>聖誕節在歐洲</h3>
<p>敦倫</p>
<p>經過了這些年的戰爭，今年冬天，歐洲普遍地是窮得多了。在倫敦，當十二月初的時候，主婦們己都在爲聖誕節準備谷種物質的享受，並希望能在政府嚴格統制下得到更多的，糖菓，肉類及水　罐頭等物品。至於酒類，英國是很少的，而由大陸運來的美酒則尚在途中，顯然是緩不濟急的了。</p>
<p>法國</p>
<p>在法國，情形更糟糕，法國人都想今冬能享受更多的食物，不過食糧價格日高。現在最大的問題－運轍困難和黑市－仍尚未解決，因此法國人對於聖誕節食物享受的希望已經無無形中消失了。</p>
<p>比·荷</p>
<p>比利時與荷蘭，比荷兩國家禽數字難較多，但其他食物數量則不夠分配。情形最壞的是德境內美軍佔領軍政府表示：德境糧食價格仍日漸高漲今冬實無法解決，英佔領區內的糧食情況更其惡劣，至於蘇聯佔領區，因爲土地比較肥沃，食糧情勢略好。因此德國人今年的聖誕節仍難改變其過去黑麵包，洋芋和白菜等粗茶淡飯的享受。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞</p>
<p>在羅爲尼亞，大的有二百萬的人口都在用穀粒粉和「紅十字湯」作聖誕節的大餐。雖大部分羅馬尼亞人能享受較好的食物，但政府若不能以大量收人來解決食糧的困難，普遍的人民生活就無法怯改善。</p>
<p>匈牙利</p>
<p>匈牙利，今年聖誕節情形是比往年好了一點，不過可怕的通貨膨漲己弄得大部分匈牙利人頭暈眼花。</p>
<p>瑞士</p>
<p>瑞士正努力在重建它們的旅行商業制度，因爲　樣，他們就可以使歐洲人吃校好的餐館，住較好的旅館了。別的前軸心國家，如義大利，義人因爲物價高漲的緣故，麺包及劣質口糧的享受，仍在求之不得，政府正爲了人民最低的物質生活而盡力掙扎怎麼還談得到高度物質享受的聖誕節呢？</p>
<p>說到南斯拉夫，雖然聯總有大批物責運入敎濟，但因受旱災的遺害，大部份南斯拉夫人仍無法得到，聖誕節較好的享受。</p>
<p>希臘</p>
<p>希臘也因物價高漲，及顧慮到明春嚴重的糧食問題，對於今年的聖誕節，也只能「得過且過」了。</p>
<p>瑞典</p>
<p>端典糧食情勢比較正常，這是因爲他對於各主要食糧配給得當的　故。</p>
<p>總結</p>
<p>總之，歐洲的情況，整個地說真情燭糧食不足，人民大都在半飽半鐵中度日子。麵包尚且想不到，何況是火鷄和燒鵝？這是戰爭結束以後的第二個聖誕節，「聖誕老人」今年重臨大地，看着這被戰爭權毀得焦頭爛額的世界，不知將發生些什麼樣的感想！</p>

<h3>告神經衰弱者</h3>
<p>— 夏鎮夷</p>
<p>過去常有不少青年從各地來信詢問種種關於神經衰弱的問題，我曾寫過一篇「談神經衰弱」（載三十年第三卷第六期中華健康雜誌）作一個總答覆，爲了這病症的普遍與影響所及的嚴重，我覺得現在還有重申的必要。</p>
<p>現代文明病</p>
<p>「神經衰弱」這名詞，實有商榷更正的必要，因爲我們顧名思義，便以爲神經是身體的主宰，那末神經「衰弱」了，身體定受嚴重的威脅，並認定爲是一種可怕的疾病，因此恐懼，焦慮，彷徨，終至失却了人生的樂趣，靑年們！你們有這種錯誤的觀念嗎？現代醫學的進步，事實上已證明了這些病人的神經組織，並沒有絲毫的損壞或衰弱，其真真的原因是由於他們人格上的病態，使他們不能應付或克服人生的艱鉅，換句話說，他們實是一羣逃避人生的弱者。所以有人說：神經衰弱是現代文明特殊的病症，倒有幾分真理，因爲文明愈進步，人們的慾望愈高遠，生活的方式愈緊張，我們的身心常有不能平衡維繫的危險，猶如一般堅固的艦艇，雖有良好的機件，但因載貨過重，經不起大風浪的襲擊而致覆舟的慘劇，所以目今不知有多少青年在高度緊張複雜的人生的海裏遭了「談覆舟」的厄運。</p>
<p>神經衰弱既如此的普遍，因此這名詞已深印入人們的腦中，好像對於傷寒症的名次一樣，我們中國人一向遇到發熱不退，不問他的病原，統稱之爲傷寒症同樣的，有不少人患了些神經症狀，常在看醫生前病人自己早已下了「神經衰弱」的診斷。事實上這一般人所稱的「神經衰弱」實是包含著許多不同的疾病，這一類的疾病，在精神病學上我們稱之爲「神經官能病」（Psychoneuross），我們每天在門診中常見這類病人，他們的主訴繁多，他們常將各種症狀，預先洋洋大觀的寫就交給醫生，並且在每次就診時會帶來了不同的新主訴，有許多病人雖然患的是輕性精神病，如「強迫觀念症」，「洗手狂」，與各種的「恐懼症」，大多數的病人是神經過敏，神經衰弱（在沒有適當名詞之前，我們姑且仍用這個名稱），自疑症，歇斯底里症，及焦慮狀態。</p>
<p>典型的病人</p>
<p>一個典型的神經衰弱患者常感覺疲倦，健忘，不易集中，頭痛，腰酸，背痛，失眠，遺精，早洩，悲觀，失望，沮喪及自卑心理，自疑症的患者對於身的機能感覺過敏，所產生的症狀，常限於身體上的各種器官，我們常遇到這種病人訴說他的心臟機能停頓了，胃腸都潰爛了，內臟轉變了位置，頭腦中的血液凝結成塊等等奇特的感覺，我曾遇見過一個中年的婦人，她訴說她腹中有一只「龜」，因此终日恐懼，焦慮而致绝食。一個歇斯底里症的病人很像是真正的　實病如麻木，失覺，麻痹，盲目，　　，感覺她變成　　　　精神失常，焦慮　　的患者常有陣發性的心悸出汗，窒息感覺，怕死，頭腦緊張，噁心嘔吐，腹瀉，便秘　　　　。病人自己會覺到焦慮，與　　　　他們的症狀。</p>
<p>當這些病人訴說各種神經敏感，憂虑，失眠，恐懼及其他含糊的症狀，一般的醫生覺得身體檢查既無病態，實沒有多化時間的价值，他們也常輕易的診斷爲「神經過敏」，或「神經衰弱」，開了一張鎮靜劑的藥方，便算了事，有時也會不耐煩的對病人說「這全是幻覺作用，沒有毛病」。其實他們的痛苦與症狀，在他們自己是千真萬確的。因此這樣便讓病人從這個醫生處到那個醫生處，徒費時間與金錢，這是何等痛心的事！</p>
<p>心理學要義</p>
<p>我們知道神經系的功用可分爲幾個階層（Levels），高級的心理階層，位於腦皮質，是代表一人的思想與精神生活；低級的生理階層位於延髓，是代表循環，呼吸，消化等自動的生理機能，從皮質中樞隨時發出心理的應響以控制生理機能，換言之，從高級到低級中樞間有聯接的神經原，使發生一個　和，平衡，總合的開　，這代表一個健康人的整個生活，從腦皮質到延髓間有兩種相反的力量，—激動與抑制—這兩種力量的基本性質，我們還沒有明瞭，但我們確知他們工作的存在，沒有這種力量，我們就沒有控制的生活，有了他就使神經系統的能力有效的表現，在生理上，交感神經對心臟的激動作用與副交感神經對心臟的壓抑應響是明　的事。在心理領域中，我們也是可見到本能的激動作用及良心的抑制的力量，這二種心理上的相反力量，使人類產生各種心理衝突，也是產生不良適應的基礎。</p>
<p>人格的二低階層就是習慣與本能，二高階層即智慧與理智，若各層沒有適當的調整即爲產生神經官能病的根源，當這種衝突所產生的情緒應響及交感神經系統，便產生機能失常，及各種內臟，腺體，關節，肌肉，循環等症狀，當其影響及於腦皮質的機能便產生各種特殊的心理病態如強迫觀念症，恐懼症，以上各點是近代學者對於神經衰弱及其他神經官能病的心理病理的剖析。</p>
<p>身心的聯繫</p>
<p>生理學家開農氏（Canuon）也曾指出恐懼及其他的情緒緊張可產生生理上的變化，當恐懼時因腎上腺素分泌過多而致心悸，發汗，瞳孔放大，腸胃蠕動與分泌停頓及新陳代謝的變化，其他情緒如憂慮，交集，失望與期待都能產生同樣的生理變化，由此我們可明瞭在長期緊張，恐懼，暴躁，焦慮的情緒下，可變化正常器官的機能，而產生不適及感覺失常，其他的人生問題如經濟困難，性生活失調，手淫的後悔，工作興趣不和，宗教信仰的衝突，家庭間不睦，生育及避孕的憂慮，都能形成神經過敏或神經衰弱的因素，自疑症的患者常是養尊處優的，爲父母溺愛的獨生子女，父母從沒有給他們一個獨立的機會，因此依賴成性，他們也不知什麼叫做困難，但是好景不長，父母不能給他的庇蔭一輩子，一旦遇到了艱難，便沒有克服的力量，由此產生各種身體氣官的病態以逃避艱難的現實，籍以求得暫時內心的平靜，在歇斯底里症及强迫觀念症中，那些過去被壓抑及分裂的經驗便是發病的根源。</p>
<p>神經衰弱及其他各種神經官能病都是由於他們的「特殊人格」，對於人生經驗所起的反應，這種「特殊人格」往往在孩提時代已成仙了，我們常見這些「神經質」的孩子，最初情緒不穩的表現如膽怯，怕羞，屈服，恐懼，夢魘，暴躁，遺尿，咬指甲，血管運動不穩定，蛋白質過敏性，變態反應，蕁麻疹，濕疹，氣喘等現象。青春期是造就成年人人格的緊要關頭這些情緒不穩的靑年常有知覺過敏，過慮未來的困難，不滿足及孤獨感，或產生性的早熟，減退或反常，更有不少青年對性的問題視爲神秘，穢褻，便在幻想中求的性的滿足，因此我們在外表上看來，這些人是鎮靜的，但他們的內心實是怕羞，膽小，猶疑，掛斷，一旦遇到人生的艱難就沒有奮鬥的毅力，便產生各種神經症狀來逃避，嚴格的說來，我們任何人若遇到非常的困難，都有這種症狀的反應，但神經質的人極平凡的挫折都不能應付，却迅速的產生各種反應。</p>
<p>至於體格方面這種人也不很堅實，他們常患體重過低，內臟下垂，痙攣性便秘，大腸炎及需要比常人更多時間的睡眠與休息，我們也常發現他們的腱反射增強，交感神經過度活動易面紅皮膚劃痕病血環及血管的不穩固，月經不調炭水化合物及水的不平衡現象。</p>
<p>人格與體格</p>
<p>我們知道整個的人是包含著身心兩方面的，所以我們研究或診斷病人必須二者兼顧，才不致有疏忽的地方，遇到這種病人，第一須先明瞭他人個，體質及人生完全的紀錄，每個人的人格是不同的，並且包括他生理的或生物學的成分，它的特殊情緒組成，他的智力，有許多是遺傳的有許多是後天從人生經驗中獲得的，我們　　人格是從人生經驗及我們與生俱來的固有本性溶合而成，惟有這協調的融合才能使人們工作遊玩，和休息形成一精確的平衡，在某種神經性質的人，任何　些特質受到威脅而不能忍受，神經症狀便產生了假使爲醫生的願安靜聽病人對他身世的敘述並且抱認真的態度，用客觀的眼光，便不難明瞭病人的人格，而且唯有如此，才能發現致病的機構，孩提時代的一切可代表個性的雛形，學校成績可指示智力程度，職業的成功與失敗也可代表一個人的固有的信任與毅力，此外從一人的婚姻及性生活的情形中也可發現他憂慮的對象是什麼，如懷孕的恐懼，性的不滿足，夫婦間的不睦，手淫的憂慮與恐懼都是重要的因素。</p>
<p>上面已講過手淫，遺精陽萎早洩，可說大部分神經衰弱患者必訴的症狀，這裏我須指出一個正確的概念，手淫果是一種不良習慣，但手淫本身的影響並不大，而是社會對手淫的態度關係很大，意識中羞悔，善意和激怒攪作一團，在精神上造成很壞的後果，換句話說，手淫主要的壞處在於和與此心理的鬥爭；同樣的，遺精本來是健康靑年在性生活未開始前應有的生理現象，每月多至四五次的遺精，本是病態，往往一般靑年因沒有正確的醫學常識，每當發生這生理現象時，又加於受報章不正當醫藥廣告的宣傳，而引起極大的恐懼，實是爲害匪淺，但當已經次數異常增多時，當然應請專家檢查了。至於陽萎，早洩，應請专家检查，看報吃藥，實是最愚蠢的人。據現在醫界研究的結果稱，大多數的陽萎，早洩病人都是由於神經質的恐懼，幼稚的膽怯及不能適應社會的結果，由此看來，醫治这些病人不單是服藥打針所能見效，最主要的還是由心理方面着手。</p>
<p>青年們留心</p>
<p>最近本社屢接不少讀者來信詢問關於種種神經衰弱的問題，除已個別答復外這裡順便提出一個多數靑年共有的傳統錯誤觀念—腎虧與神經衰弱—腎虧陰虛等名詞是否國舊醫所沿用的術語，實是沒有科學與勝利基礎的錯誤觀念。吾們知道腎臟的機能是專司排泄是小便製造的工廠，對於一般神經衰弱患者常有的症狀—遺精，早洩，陽萎，—根本風馬牛不相及的。因了「虧」就需「補」，更因一般人對於腎臟與兩性腺體機能的混淆，「荷爾蒙」「賜保命」等動聽名詞的針藥，便認爲「進補」唯一的良藥，更因各種不正當醫藥的宣傳，使患者皆趨之若鶩，徒費金錢，白受痛苦，何等愚蠢！</p>
<p>樂觀吧！神經質的人們，你們切莫悲觀，失望焦慮，你們切莫受廣告欺人的宣傳，而浪費金錢與時間，打針吃藥對於這病是徒然的，唯有以瞭解，激勵，和啟發可使你們重新評定自己的價值，重新回到人　的，工作的，娛樂的，和愛情的世界裏去。</p>

<h3>對精神病人應抱的態度</h3>
<p>— 劉瀹慈</p>
<p>在我們一生之中，多少總有幾次在馬路上曾遇到過瘋狂的精神病人，舉凡他們一被發現，馬上就可以看見許多行人立刻把他們圈住，佇立圍觀，仿佛欣賞一種玩耍遊戲似的，不肯離去，假如我們仔細對那些觀眾們加以觀察，我們就會發現他們對病者的態度却個個不同，有的就對病者任意取笑，妄加批評，仿佛好容易才尋到這樣一個談話的笑料，有的則漠不關心，見如未見，聞如未聞，對病者根本沒有什麼特殊的表示，看看罷了，也有的則對病者長吁短嘆，也仿佛有些惋惜病者似的，如果病者正在發狂，一　　大唱歌曲，變成做出許多奇怪的表情，我們就可看見，觀眾們馬上就都不約而同的捧腹大笑，一忽見病者赤身裸體，　　　　，我們又會　　　　　　，關在房裏，不許他再出來，沒有家屬的人，也就流落街頭，不知所息了，由上面的態度，我們就可以深深的看得出來，一個人如果不幸得了精神病症，除了被別人幸災樂禍引爲笑料外，所得之於環境的，只是輕視；侮辱；談笑；謾罵，而絲毫沒有得到人類應有的同情。</p>
<p>傳統錯誤的態度既然如此，某家如果有了精神病人，因爲家屬先對病者歧視，按着「以己度人」的心裏，家人一定也怕別人對病者歧視，所以多是不願意向人提及，同時因爲病者在發狂時期常闖禍的關係，所以索性就把他禁在一個房間裏，不許他跑出來，只要他不吵不鬧也就夠了，每日三餐，當然不許他與家人共享，配給一份就算了事，如果有親友偶而提到病者的時候，家人一定也會替病者用旁的措辭來隱瞞，一則一般人根本不知道精神病也可以醫，總以爲是神鬼作祟，二則是顧全家庭面子的關係，怕難爲情，他們縱知道精神病也可以醫，可是他不肯來醫，再者因爲病人　　　的關係，一切　　　　　　情形之下　　的病者，真不知有多少了。</p>
<p>所以，　或在現今所謂的文明社會裏，無論何時何地，只要一提起「瘋子」二字來，人們大都　是對她　　一種畏懼，和歧視，他們的心理，就是認爲病者「此生已休」了，其實，事實告訴我們，患精神病的人同患其他病的人是無二致的，只要醫治得宜，他們痊癒的機會也是一樣的，他們病癒後也能像常人做出一番轟轟烈烈的事業，舉例來說，在一千九百年，美國耶魯大學有一位高材生名Ｃlifford　Beers的，他就是一位曾生過兩年精神病的人，當他痊癒之後，不但著了一本最有價值的書，書名“A　mind　thatf　ound　itsell”，對於醫學界有極珍貴的供獻，而且，他又繼續努力而成爲心理醫生運動的發起人，在我國，我們聽說過曾有一位羅鋒先生，他也是一位患過精神病的學者，當他好了以後，曾把他得病的經過與心得，覆述了一遍，在民國三十三年，也出版了一本「瘋狂八月記」，該書問世後，對於醫學的供獻尤天，中西對照，成就相等，他們病後工作的能力非一般普通的常人所能比得上的。</p>
<p>總而言之，精神病並不異於其他的種種病症，因爲他也是一種病，並不足奇，患了精神病的人也並不兩樣於患有旁的病症的人，所以也不足怪。換了肺病，我們都敢大胆的就醫，患了精神病我們也該馬上去就醫，我們對患肺病的人既加愛護，我們對患精神病的人更該愛護，他們的了病後，所以也應該享受一樣的待遇，因爲他們是得了病，而不是犯了罪，同時我們早該覺悟，不該打他們，罵他們，而不給他們非人類的待遇。</p>

<h3>展開文藝建設</h3>
<p>— 吳敏態</p>
<p>文藝是反抗精神底象徵，是生命窮促苦悶悲憤時呌出來的一種生命！她是人類社會巾的各種各樣奇離變幻的活生生事實，藉着他們的形象的力而激起文學家的敏感的情感的充溢，發出或呻，或呌，或怒嗟，或號泣，或諷刺，或抗議，或呼籲，或讚美的聲音，因而再用語言文字創造表達出來的一種藝術！她不但要從表面上眞實地暴露現實，反映社會，刻劃黑暗，歜頌光明，而且更應從殘酷的現實中，提供出一種足以喚醒足以警覺人民的眞眞實實的生活思想，掘發出那些隱藏在光亮和美麗的背後的黑暗和醜惡毒害的眞相，進而刺破那些包裹在惡瘤裏面的污穢膿血！故我們可以說：文藝是推動社會進化的原動力，是哺養人類靈魂的母乳！</p>
<p>固然，我們不必特別强調文藝的威力遠勝過槍桿的射程！也不必特別渲染又藝的效果比將士的戰鬥更重要，但文藝輔助抗戰建國的精神功能與激發民族思想愛國的情緒，卻是很顯然而誰也不能抹煞的！</p>
<p>過去我全國文藝靑年，總是不畏强權，不怕艱險，首先用點點墨花化作滴滴熱血的筆鋒，啓　振聾，掃蕩羣魔，做了時代的前驅，革命的先鋒！而今，在這建國的過渡紛亂時期，全國文要背年，更應再接再厲，積極地展開文藝建設，積極地建設健康而鞏固的文藝壁壘，擊潰那些含有毒素荒謬淫誨的作品，而面對着污濁奸偽醜惡的現實，用如鋼與鋼的摩擦，鐵與鐵的撞擊，血與汗的交流而富有積極戰鬥氣氛的筆鋒，指出時代的錯誤，揭露社會的黑暗，吐露大衆的苦　，更進而給未來的時代指出一條正確燦爛的坦途！</p>
<p>文藝靑年們，時代在呼喚我們，讓我們密密地集中火力！讓我們緊緊地握起手來！</p>
<h3>一顆紐子</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>在冷淸的旅途上，冒着寒冽的風，步行了一天的路程，雙手凍優，兩條腿感覺非常沉重；與莫說在一步步的走着，還不如說在一步步的拖着，手裏的竹杖，也跟着在地上拖，發出疲乏的聲音，同時眼見太陽已快要沉落，身旁的一個影子拉得很長，心裏不免有點善慌。</p>
<p>正在道個時候，忽然見到前面有一個小小的山鎭，街頭一　小飯店的市招和爐喪的火燄，在向我招手，我是多麼地高興啊！</p>
<p>趕忙投奔前去，只見當爐的是一位三十歲上下的婦大，她穿一身藍布棉襖褲，頭上紮了一塊花布，完全是鄕村間樸素的裝束，爐火把她的圓險兒映得通紅。</p>
<p>我雖是一個蹙脚的旅客，但她對我和隨身的一個小衣包，並不帶一點輕視。相反的，如在慇懃地招待我。什麼事不要我煩心，她先給我安排一個鋪位，雖然上面舖的是稻草，但我把它當做席夢思一樣的舒適。接着她給我一盆臉水，和一大壺的茶。盆麥的水，雖然帶着多量的沙粒，一塊毛巾也不大乾掙，但我凍疼了的臉頰和雙手，急於要溫喛一下，也顧不到麼多了。焦豆穀所泡的茶，頗有一點咖啡的美味，我也樂於喝下去。執的饅頭，熱的小米稀飯，伴着監豆子送下肚，覺得非常香甜。</p>
<p>飯後，蓋桐油燈已經放在我舖旁的桌上。這時店門已閉，市街上巳經很況寂，山間的野獸，在發出怕人的嚎呌聲。</p>
<p>用不到我吩咐，她已把一盆燒開的水，放在我舖勞地上，給我燙脚，發　的脚經過開水一燙，把整天旅途中所受的勞頓，都丟掉了。我一面燙脚，一面和她攀談，從鎭上的情形，一直談到她店裏的情形，她說話和動作一樣的伶俐。當時她告訴我丈夫整天在外賭博喝酒，總要夜深纔歸來，店裏的事都由她照顧，還有一個六十多歲的老婆婆，早已在天還沒有黑的時候于就上後房了。說着眼裏似乎有一些淚光。</p>
<p>燙過脚，她把我走濕了的襪子，在水裏搓了一搓，搓過了，又把它放在灶邊烘着：</p>
<p>一夜烘乾，明天一早，仍舊能夠穿上脚了！」她說。</p>
<p>同時她見到我棉襖上的幾個鈕子快要落下，她找出了針綫，一定要給我縫；</p>
<p>「你睡下，把棉襖脫下來！」</p>
<p>「眞對不起！」</p>
<p>「不，我給你縫兩針，不費什麼事，出門人的苦處，我是挺曉得的！」</p>
<p>桐油燈在爆着星星的火花，她把針尖挑起了燈芯，凑近燈在給我縫着鈕子，針綫穿貫布襖在發出微微的響聲，應和着她輕微的呼息聲。</p>
<p>縫到最後，她告訴我：</p>
<p>「你的衣上，落掉一個鈕子！」</p>
<p>「少一個，也不要緊！」</p>
<p>「不，少一個鈕子，穿在身上是不暖熱的！」說着她很快地在內衣上摘下了一顆同樣的黑鈕子。</p>
<p>「這樣，我有鈕子，你又沒有了！」</p>
<p>「我沒有不要緊，你明天一早就要趕路的呀！」</p>
<p>一個受慣社會冷淡的旅客，想不到在山鎭的小飯店裏得到了一絲人問的溫暖。</p>

<p>— 俞劉華</p>
<p>十五年前這淮北畫家劉葵中於海上，見其花卉習吳“碩，醫法習清道人，已卓然有以自立。今年重過於上海，出其近作見示，煥然改觀，巳一脫故習，無復原來面貌，其進步之速，令人刮目。</p>
<p>花卉自明代林良劍水墨寫意後，周之冕又劍鈎花點葉派，徐天池以天縱之才，縱橫揮洒，無不如意，而寫意花卉遂盡其變而造其極。及至淸初，石濤以淋漓之筆出之，八大以純古之筆運之，不求工而自工。此後李復堂用轉折頓挫之筆，近於周之冕；蓋新羅織巧秀逸之筆，寫意而近於工筆，淸末趙之謙吳讓之以寫魏碑之筆，作寬博艷麗之畫，別有意趣。民初吳昌碩以篆籀之筆寫花卉，粗野之中富於撲厚之氣，一時學者風起雲湧，蔚然成泊。然學之者多墨守成稿，不知變化，漸爲人所厭棄。獨劉君矯然不爲吳法所團，由粗野收而爲秀逸，由古拙化而爲淸靈。由趙之謙李復堂而上溯周之冕，隱然爲花卉之正宗，毫無大紅大綠之惡習，洵堪尚已。</p>
<p>淸道人以一波三折寫鐘鼎篆隸，固別有妙趣，然終非古法所有，以用筆過拘，而神氣不暢，不免矯揉造作之嫌，劉君初習淸道人亦派猶花卉之習吳昌碩，近則漸將淸道人方怯脫化，所臨鐘鼎篆隸一返鐘鼎篆隸之本來面目，寓轉折於流利之中，實而不滯，華而不浮，近代書家能如此者已不可多觀。至於草書尤爲純熟瀟洒，不落近人窠臼，學而能變，每變愈高，劉君之造詣，眞有未可限量者矣。</p>
<p>劉君近出其近作數百點，展覽於中國畫苑，嗜此道者盍往觀焉，庶以證余言之不謬也。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　127</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「櫃上的一名小夥計，部經理看她能幹，兩個月前紹介她到「第一商店」做雜役。不到一星期，第一商店總經理瞧她長得嬌媚，又十分伶俐，把她挑到寫字閒裏應戰。昨天晚上，她親眼看到了「介紹所」的老闆，佩服得極了。老闆在第一店的經過，部由她傳傅達出來。我們的部經理發見她很忠實，可以升到山級服務項下，所以責成她打聽「貨品」消息。湊巧她很孰一悉「貨品」貯藏門部的事，今天午前就把事情弄妥了。所以部經理呌我儘五小時內赶到老闆這裏來……」</p>
<p>這是鶴見秘密組織裏的經常談話方式，但需要詮釋一下：</p>
<p>鶴見的組織，在秘密談話中，自稱爲「介紹所」，或「百貨商店」，或「編譯所」等等；看環境適合何種性質，就用何種組織的「行語」談話。手下的脚色，大致分爲三等；最高等的親信，共有二十名左右，都是鶴見數年來挑選的生死同志，不僅各有專長，精明强幹，並且志趣相同，編號都是「〇」字頭，有的掌管着十二座秘密電台之一，有的担任着特殊職務；如長辛店的「〇四」，東京的「〇十二」等。</p>
<p>這高級親信手下，都有二三兩等的工作人員；第二等是第一等各人的親信，第三等則是二等的親信。這兩等還分着甲乙丙級。這「親信」的維持力式，種類甚雜，前文已經提過，有的想升官發財，有的則是特殊性的，類如復仇，或知遇，或自來的友誼關係，或某種興趣相同，或爲其他國家秘密會社的份子。不過他們僅有「縱」的組織，沒有「橫」的關係。就這縱的組織，也僅僅限於一層，那就是他或她的直接關係人。</p>
<p>這種組織與其他秘密團社不同的一點，乃是幹部人數倒比二三兩等級相加之和的總數，還要多出二三名；因多半「〇」字頭的子下，並無下手。除此以外，多半時臨時僱員，不能算在組織內。</p>
<p>上文所提的「第一商店」是指當任的內閣而說，總經理當然是指近衛。據野猪的口頭報告，那探明「七封秘械」貯藏所在的人，乃是一個女子，名呌吉田圓子，由〇十二設法把她弄到近衛別府裏充當雜役，被近衛看中她，就選做侍妾之一，成功了一條極有用的內綫。自從〇十二去解決那不利於鶴見，六個吊綫的傢伙們，反被第五縱隊赶走之後，同時鶴見又被近衛强迫他去謁見，於是就授命圓子，在內隨機保衛鶴見。這圓子一見鶴見，就十二傾誠悅服，願意效死。</p>
<p>這也並非筆者主張「英雄主義」把鶴見說得這般英雄，一見就呌人傾倒，簡直成了一個「超人」。無奈日本女子，天性上就有這點「小母鷄」一類的性格，愛虛榮，愛男性，愛英雄。哪怕你是一個人力車夫，只要你是一個壯男子，比人家跑得快，她就會崇拜你。何況在日本全國三千五百萬壯男中，（根據日人一九三五年人口調查，是眞是假，筆者不負責任），除了極少數的西洋雜雜種外，（日本自叫治維新以來，全國除了北海通少數的原種漁人外，十九都是混血。）哪裏看到得幾個像鶴見這樣的美男子？因此也無怪這隻「小母鷄」要一見傾心了。</p>
<p>（其實鶴見在我國二十幾歲的靑年中，比較起來，並不特別俊俏風流，也就是長得勻亭·英毅·有氣魄·風姿瀟酒，呌人看得順眼些罷了。）</p>

<h3>會議</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>民主政治離不開會議這一形式的，會議中可以銀錄一個人，無論是修養氣度，機智和決斷。人們推崇英國的巴力門，人們又更知道英國的從政者受巴力門的影饗，維多利亞王朝最後的一個宰相狄斯粱利四十年議會中的奮鬥史，讀歷史的人將爲之感泣的。</p>
<p>我們的國民大會，會議已徑卅四天了，一千二三頁人來自各處，集中在南京，相聚一堂，討論憲怯，其中雖有不少起伏和爭執，但大體上經過的情形都很好，我們也許還在學習，然而這民主政治的第一課，成績不能算壞。</p>
<p>讓人們說出他的意見來，即使是錯的，他也有這份權利。別看那些跋涉千山萬水而來的代表，他們祗要在大會上說出一兩句話，他們會忘去辛勞，他們是取得了代價了。</p>
<p>在這三十四天會議經過中，不少塲面值得我們特別欣賞的，這里，且舉出十八日綜合審查委員會中傳斯年，蔣勻田，陳啓天三位的話來（見昨日本報第一版南京專電）：</p>
<p>傅斯年：余並非堅欲維持前决之決議，以達遂余個人主張之目的，乃係由於精神之感觸，自認余之靈魂未予別人任何保證，應有發言之自由。……余決不奢望以此理由推翻此覆議案，僅希望將之附入紀錄。</p>
<p>蔣勻田：余主張對此一問題暫緩決定，待各方再推誠協議。蓋第一，吾等少數黨在會議中之作用，僅可以情理實現其主張，如恃表決權，實難達任何目的，此爲吾人所不取；第二，對此一點尖說之爭執，縱國民黨方面運用其嚴明之紀律，使各黨員放棄主張，情感上難免有不偷快之處，此亦吾人所不願。第三，此艱巨之制憲工作，黨派方面僅國民，靑年及民社三黨參加，吾人必須注意彼等未參加人士之意向，俾對吾人之決議可邀得同意與接受……</p>
<p>陳啓天：數方面對一件事之決定，實不可能完全贊同，能求其次而求得大體滿意，已屬佳事。</p>
<p>心平氣和，入情近理，頓合民主政治鬥士的風度。</p>
<p>老百姓不是沒有眼睛的，大會中的一動一靜，一言一笑，都在密切注意中。因爲他們一方面監督，一方面也在學習。</p>
<h3>三老爺真靈</h3>
<p>— 墨</p>
<p>前樓王家的孩子，因發寒熱而不起床，王太太因此很焦急。</p>
<p>亭子間好婆出主意，說是碰到了齷齪－赤佬，只消晚上送送羹飯，燒燒錫箔，王太太唯命是聽，夜裏如法泡製。</p>
<p>送羹飯繞錫箔，寒熱依然很厲害，於是在後樓嫂嫂，見義勇爲而仗義執言，依她的意思還是喊一個「關亡婆」來「看香頭」，王太太只要兒子的病好，什麼都依。</p>
<p>關亡的結果，說是星宿不好，須呌道士解解星宿，同時還得用豬頭三牲到廟裏許願，錢糧解得足，毛病好得快，一切的一切，王太太無不「O.K.」</p>
<p>王太太兒子的病，祇見加重，一一房東太太埋怨王太太道「孩子病得這樣的重，何不到白克路某某里的「三老爺」處去求仙方。「三老爺」眞靈，伲大囡拉爹的痔瘡毛病，勿知看了多少郎中嘸沒用，後來「三老爺」一醫就好而且求子得子，下頭灶披間的接嬸不是求了「三老爺」現在有三個號頭的身孕了嗎？……」</p>
<p>「三老爺」的仙方等於白開水，吃了下去，毛病反見加重，至此纔想着了大夫，可是得病到看醫生已逾兩星期了。</p>
<p>醫生開好了藥方，對王太太說：這藥方不過是開開路的，功效很微，最好是購服他秘製的藥粉。變料一服十萬元，單料一服六萬元，至少吃三服。王太太希望兒子毛病早日痊愈，自然購雙料的躉批拏出法幣三十萬元。</p>
<p>仙人不識丸散，這藥粉又有誰研究得出是什麥藥物合成的呢？那只有天曉得了。所謂「修合雖無人見，存心自目有天知」，不過醫生的包車夫却明白，因爲這藥粉是包車來用力在「鐵船」裏碾成功的。據說是這幾件主要藥：「冬桑葉，天花粉，地骨皮等」，保險吃不壞，不過也吃不好毛病的。</p>
<p>王太太的兒子，藥粉只吃了兩服，已送進了殯儀館，許多人把一個活生生的孩子殺了本算，還說這孩子該是「命盡祿絕」。</p>
<h3>人市塲</h3>
<p>— 蔡麟</p>
<p>「人行」乃「介紹所」之別名，即「薦頭店」是也。</p>
<p>人行地點大多數設在小菜塲附近，人行的營業時間，刻板在上午小菜塲未收攤之前。</p>
<p>人行裏的貨品，猶之乎十六舖鹼貨行內之醃猪，所謂存貨山積，有娘姨，有大姐，有組做，有針綫，有奶嬸嬸，有羲領娘，有精壯的有乾癢的，有俊俏的，有醜相的，有年輕的包車夫，應有盡有，不及細載。</p>
<p>人行裏的老　，非但在上海兜得轉，並且在鄕下也得人頭熟，如果娘姨手脚不乾凈，偷了人家的東西，「三十六着」往鄕下一跑，人行老闆照樣有顏色把她軋回上海，不必驚動「包打聽」，所以人行的信用卓着，此了幾家「搖搖動」的「銀行」來得「彈硬」。</p>
<p>人行老闆的「頭子」又非常活絡，見主客上門，如剃頭店老間一般的盤懃招待，要是女主顧上門，老闆準會把老娘姨喊幾個出來面試，反之男客上門，則巴結起見，儘量揀年輕的大姐餉客，如果走馬上任，一薦成功，那麼老闆有「上下手」可拿，正是兩面進賬。</p>
<p>人行一到下半日是休息了，店堂中經常有一桌「麻將」，大家賭賒帳，等到上生意時還錢，不過「股鈿」却是現捉，向不掛欠。</p>
<p>××路有幾家人行的二層攔，臨時作爲「台基」由年輕的小娘姨在馬路上兜圈子，倘過急色兒「釘梢」，互談之下，即可成交。春風一度的代價，還得與老闆「哈夫」，這幾家「人行」更名副其實了。</p>
<h3>妙文共賞</h3>
<p>— 天視譯自「雜誌文摘」</p>
<p>某藥廠出品了一種神經鎭靜劑；爲了宣傳其功效起見，曾紹公開徵求用戶的證明函件。其中獲得首獎的一篇，錄述如下：「我不知怎樣推薦才好，但是我可以報告一段經過事實，足證貴廠出品請良，奏效如神。我的妻子，是一個最神經質不過的女子，簡直沒有人敢和她同睡，可是自從服了一一瓶貴廠的催眠藥水後，幾乎任何人能和她「牀睡了」。</p>
<h3>原子彈　何秘之有</h3>
<p>— 陳中繩譯自支加哥太陽報</p>
<p>「原子炸憚根本無秘密之可言」，不信的話，我們可以從下述富有戲劇性的故事中，得到一個新的證明，講這個故事的是年靑的費立浦馬歷斯博士，他是一倆爲政府研究原子炸彈的原子專家，也是第一批到日本廣島去調查原子炸彈毀減力的調查人員。</p>
<p>他一到廣島，就碰到了日本物理化學研究社的西名吉敎授，這位西名吉男敎授正在設備不值美元的「家庭實騐室」中，研究原子炸彈。他並沒有讀過，西姆塞報告書－那是美國國防部對於若干種原子炸彈秘密的說明。西名敎授所據以研究的，只是原子炸彈在廣島鑤炸後的後果。</p>
<p>可是西名敎授對於原子炸彈的主要事實，已經編著成册，而目說也奇怪，有幾種情狀在美國一般人認爲大秘密的，西一成博士，已經都知道了。不僅此也，據費立浦博士看來，西名敎授對於原子炸彈各方面的研究，都已經摸到「路道」了，但是他听有的設備却不過二十美元，一個普通高中學生，就有那麼多錢。</p>
<p>費立浦博士所以要公開這個故事，就是要使人知道，只要有適當的設備，一個像西名敎授那樣的科學家，就可在短期內知道原子炸彈的秘密了。</p>
<p>費立浦博士的意義是很明顯的：原子炸彈旣然是無秘可守，其唯一有效的保全方法，就是用全世界的力量來控制原子炸彈和其他戰爭利器。</p>
<p>此時此地</p>

<h3>「神搶手」</h3>
<p>— 董几石</p>
<p>神槍手影片中，憑一挺機槍，能生擒德軍百三十二名，眞不愧是「神槍手」！</p>
<p>在中國的社會上，有的是「神搶手」，而非「神槍手」！這一類神搶手的本領，專門「搶錢」，把千萬人的錢，能夠在不知不覺中，搶到他的囊中，却不費「吹灰之力」，眞可說「神乎其技」。這也是不愧爲「神搶手」！</p>
<p>年關在邇，這幾天的「神搶手」，正在大肄活動，搶一票過年呢！蘇州人所謂「殺年夜」是也。</p>

<h3>寬厚圓滑的　何成濬</h3>
<p>— 彌山</p>
<p>國大爲了封論憲草，會經有過很熱烈的爭論，主持那第十决大會的，是國大主席團之一－何成濬。</p>
<p>凡稍稍注意到民國歷史的人，總記得何成濬是個政治理的軍人。爲人儉樸，胸中城府極深，雖然出身軍官學校，而一向善與各方周旋，應付圓滑老到，在中國軍人羣中可算非常難得。</p>
<p>何氏字雪竹，湖北隨縣人，今年已六十五歲。自二十二歲參加革命起，到現在已有四十三年，資格甚老。個父建國兩粵時，出任大元帥府中的參軍，落落人海，未能展才。民國十五年蔣主席出師北伐，以何氐才足大用，乃起爲國民革會軍總參議兼駐滬總代表，平地靑雲，於是一帆風順。桂系叛變時，　府委何氏爲北平行營主任，收拾北方桂系叛變軍隊，戰禍泯滅，而何氏又聯絡閻錫山張學良，以爲已助。民國十九年，開始路上政治舞台，就任湖北省政府主席。</p>
<p>那時何氏領導下的湖北省政府，財政廳長是現任上海市長吳國楨，民政廳長是「打老虎」的劉文島，套一句俗語說，可謂「堂堂陣容，堅强無匹」。</p>
<p>何氏氣量寬宏，又能忍辱負重，同僚有與之爲難的，何總假痴假呆，任其譏冒嘲弄。主鄂政數年，不像一般跋扈自大的作風，且喜交游，不大搭架子。有這麼一個傳奇性的故事：何氐擅踢足球，人稱「何無敵」，曾關－體育塲，任人遊散。何在公餘之暇，也常常來和他人角藝。故事就這麼發生了；有某師長與何有嫌隙，賄通了一個川中方丈的徒弟王某，敎他常遊體育塲，伺隙予何氏以「中傷」。誰知何氏見王，愛其拳藝，深相結納，王氏感何氏盛意，又想起自已師父三戒六禁之訓，不禁大悔，把本意對何氏全部和盤直告。何聞言初頗驚駭，繼而坦然，對某師長亦絕無芥蒂，知其事者，莫不佩服何氏雅量。</p>

<h3>President Truman Issues Statement: U.S. Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged; Condemns Communist Party for Undermining Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>U.S. President Truman issued a careful statement of 3,500 words at a press conference in Washington on the 18th, reiterating the U.S. policy toward China. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The United States supports the position of the Chinese National Government, and the statement issued last December remains valid.</p>
<p>(2) U.S. troops stationed in China will be reduced to 12,000 in the short term, and their mission is only to assist China in repatriating Japanese nationals and protecting transportation lines.</p>
<p>(3) Special Envoy Marshall has achieved considerable success in China in promoting Chinese unity and peace, and his presence in China will greatly assist in resolving China's domestic difficulties.</p>
<p>(4) The Political Consultative Conference of various parties and factions in China was undermined by the Communist Party's cessation of consultations. Special Envoy Marshall, feeling the seriousness of the problem and the importance of peace, remains stationed in China.</p>
<p>(5) The ceasefire agreement was undermined by the incessant conflicts, culminating in the Communist Party's occupation of Changchun.</p>
<p>(6) The Export-Import Bank will lend another $500 million to China. Whether this loan can be allocated will depend on the policy clarified by the U.S. government last December.</p>
<p>(7) The United States is prepared to assist China in restoring peace and achieving political democratization. However, the United States has no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Statement</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] President Truman issued a statement on China today, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>In December of last year, I issued a statement outlining the views of this government on China. At that time (as it is now), we believed that a united and democratic China was extremely important to world peace. Expanding the foundation of the National Government so that it can represent the people of the five nations will accelerate China's progress towards this goal, and China has an obvious responsibility to other United Nations, that is, to stop military conflicts within its territory, because this conflict is a major threat to world stability and peace. The three foreign ministers in Moscow last year also clarified that our allies, Britain and the Soviet Union, also agreed with this view. On December 27 last year, Byrnes, Molotov, and Bevin issued a statement, which stated:</p>
<p>"The three foreign ministers have exchanged views on the situation in China and believe that there must be a united and democratic China under the leadership of the National Government. A National Government that broadly accommodates democrats and a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs."</p>
<h3>Promoting Unity and Democracy is China's Own Task</h3>
<p>In my statement last December, I also clarified the policy of this government. We recognize the National Government of the Republic of China as the legitimate government, and we are determined to assist the Chinese government in handling post-war recovery areas and disarming and repatriating Japanese aggressors. In addition, if China moves along the above-mentioned path towards peace and unity, we are prepared to provide economic and other assistance to China.</p>
<p>I urged General Marshall to go to China on my behalf. His implementation plan will be based on my statement on China. He fully knows how to carry out his mission. He knows that stopping the civil war, expanding the foundation of the Chinese government, and promoting a united and democratic China are the work of the Chinese people themselves. He went to China as a great American, contributing his outstanding talents to assist the Chinese people.</p>
<p>During the war, the Chinese and American governments signed an agreement on training and equipping a special army (totaling 39 divisions). This training work finally ended on the day of victory over Japan. When Marshal arrived in China, the work of equipping and transferring had also been largely completed.</p>
<p>The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union also took it upon themselves to liberate China (including the return of "Manchuria" to China). The U.S. government agreed to assist the Chinese government in recovering the areas liberated from the Japanese army, including Manchuria. Because China lacked ships and transport planes, the U.S. assisted in sending National troops to Central China, Taiwan, North China, and "Manchuria," including three armies transported by air and one army transported by sea. Most of this troop movement was completed or started before Marshall arrived in China.</p>
<p>Repatriating Japanese Troops is Related to Peace</p>
<p>The work of resolving armaments and building and sending Japanese troops has progressed too slowly. We believe that assisting China in this regard is extremely important to the future peace and balance of China and the entire East Asia. There are as many as three million Japanese troops and Japanese administrative personnel, technicians, and high-level personnel in China who have surrendered but have not yet been defeated. These must be repatriated under difficult circumstances. At the request of the Chinese government, we stationed some American troops in China. When the day of victory over Japan arrived, we immediately dispatched Marine Corps to land in North China. The main task of this team was to assist in the repatriation of Japanese people. When Marshall arrived in China, only about 200,000 Japanese people had been repatriated.</p>
<p>When he arrived in China, Marshall also faced extremely bad internal situation. Due to the war and the civil war that has occurred since then, the country's transportation has been severely damaged. This damage has prevented the revival of China's economy and the distribution of relief supplies, and has made the deportation of Japanese expatriates a slow and difficult process. The destruction of wartime factories, the inflation caused by the war, the economic blockade actions taken by the Japanese in the occupied areas after the victory over Japan, and the traffic obstructions that have brought the economic life of the entire China to a standstill have brought indescribable suffering to millions of people and deprived the victory of its importance to the majority of the Chinese people, greatly increasing internal tensions and disputes in China.</p>
<p>Executive Headquarters Promotes Work</p>
<p>It is extremely important for China to resolve its domestic difficulties on its own and accelerate the completion of this plan. We have a promise to assist the Chinese government in completing this plan. Marshall's experience and wisdom will greatly assist China in resolving its domestic difficulties.</p>
<p>After Marshall arrived in China, the situation changed rapidly. Following the unanimous adoption of his selfless advice by various parties and factions, the agreement on a comprehensive ceasefire was announced on January 10. The characteristic of the agreement was the establishment of the Peiping Executive Headquarters. All parties believed that due to inconvenient transportation and the lack of integration of the sentiments of the front-line troops in various places, the orders to stop conflicts and retreat to the original defenses could hardly be implemented unless a joint executive agency trusted by both parties could carry out its tasks under any circumstances in various places.</p>
<p>The headquarters is working under the leadership of three committees: one is an American, serving as chairman, one is a representative of the Chinese government, and the other is a representative of the Chinese Communist Party. Robertson, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in China, served as chairman until his return to the country in the autumn of this year. In order to carry out work in various places, the headquarters also established executive committees in various places. Each group was presided over by one American, government, and CCP official. They rushed to all dangerous places where fighting had not stopped or where there was a stalemate, trying to implement the ceasefire order. They often carried out their work under extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances. The degree of cooperation between government and CCP officials in the headquarters and the team is a great proof, showing that although the KMT-CCP dispute has lasted for 20 years, there is still the possibility of cooperation between the two parties.</p>
<p>Political Progress Has Also Been Made</p>
<p>The same progress has also been made in the political field. On January 10, the Political Consultative Conference was unveiled, with representatives from the KMT, the CCP, and several small political parties attending the meeting. In the three weeks of direct discussions, the PCC reached a series of political agreements on important political and military issues. The agreement stipulates the organization of a transitional coalition government, inviting various parties and factions to participate, and stipulates that before the convocation of the National Assembly, the constitution will be revised along the democratic path, and the KMT and CCP troops will be reduced in order to merge into a small-scale, modernized national army responsible to the government representing the people. In March, General Marshall returned to the United States. He reported that after these agreements were reached, the Chinese people had made important progress in peace and unity. He also pointed out that unless China's economic decline is immediately stopped, especially the restoration of the transportation system, these agreements cannot be smoothly implemented. Political unity cannot be built on a chaotic economy. This government has approved several small loans to the Chinese government in order to meet emergency post-war needs. This action is the same as that taken by the United States in other war-torn areas of the world. A total of 66 million U.S. dollars were borrowed for six plans, mainly for the purchase of cotton, ships, and materials for repairing railways, but these emergency measures were not sufficient. After China made important progress in accordance with the agreement (according to Marshall's report), the Export-Import Bank separately allocated 500 million U.S. dollars as a possible additional loan, which was granted to Chinese government agencies and private enterprises in accordance with the principle of individual plans. Whether this loan can actually be allocated will obviously depend on the policy clarified by this government on July 15, 1945. Up to now, this 500 million U.S. dollar loan has not been changed, but it has not been allocated. (The following is transferred to the second page)</p>
<h3>The Yenan Side Will Officially Respond to the U.S. Statement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan recently issued a statement saying: Yenan will officially respond to President Truman's statement.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Talks Denies Issuance of New Banknotes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Minister Peng solemnly denied the rumor that the government will issue new currencies such as Sun Yat-sen banknotes at a press conference on the afternoon of the 19th. According to him, this statement is "groundless and completely untrue."</p>
<h3>China Will Not Have Positive or Negative Response to the U.S. President's Statement; Indicates That the U.S. Procedure Towards China Will Not Change</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 19th] The Chinese government will not have an official response to President Truman's statement, because senior leaders believe that the President's words were aimed at the various debates on his China policy over the past year, and not aimed at China. Government officials are clearly satisfied with the President's statement, believing that the President's words are tantamount to endorsing President Chiang's actions to move towards democracy. Although neutral observers believe that the President's document does not support the National Government, they believe that it can at least indicate that the procedure formulated by the President and implemented under the leadership of Marshal Marshall will not change drastically in the short term.</p>
<h3>Results of Comprehensive Review of the Constitution; National Assembly Scheduled to Discuss Tomorrow; General Assembly Continued to Hear Reports Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The 21st meeting of the Presidium was held at 4 pm on the 19th, chaired by Huang Yun. The meeting discussed the procedure for discussion after the review was completed and decided to hold the 11th General Assembly at 9 am on the 20th. The Comprehensive Review Committee will report on the results of the review and will not conduct discussions for the time being. There will be no meeting in the afternoon. The 12th General Assembly will begin discussions on the 21st. In addition, the chairman of the General Assembly on the 20th will be Cheng, and Chen Cheng will report on the comprehensive meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The 11th meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 am on the 19th, with 1,190 representatives attending. The conveners of the various constitution review committees continued to report on the review process. The second group of the presidium was on duty, chaired by Tian Jiongjin. After the secretariat reported, the secretary-general read the report of the presidium: (1) The session of the General Assembly was previously decided to be extended until the 19th. It is now found that the comprehensive review work has not yet been completed, and the General Assembly still has the procedures of the second and third readings. Therefore, it has been decided to extend it for another two days, until the 21st. (2) The First Review Committee of the Constitution stated in a letter: "When the Review Committee reviewed Chapter 12 on elections, women representatives proposed adding a clause to Chapter 12; that is, in accordance with Proposal No. 234, add the following item after Article 130 of the Constitution: "Various elections should stipulate quota for elected officials, at least 20 percent of which shall be determined by law." The review committee unanimously passed it and has included it in the review report. However, in the tenth general assembly, the written report separately prepared by the review committee was omitted. Please supplement the report to the general assembly." The discussion items were to continue listening to the reports of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th review committees. At this point, the review report work came to an end. The chairman announced that after the comprehensive review report was submitted, further discussions would be held. The meeting adjourned at 11:45 am, and the general assembly stopped holding meetings in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Review Committee Ends</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Comprehensive Review Committee was held at 4:15 pm on the 19th, chaired by Chen Cheng, with 135 representatives attending. The discussion items were as follows: (1) The number of people during the Legislative Yuan's reconsideration, (2) The number of legislators, (3) The issue of adding clauses on the autonomous system of Mongolia and Tibet in Chapter 11, (4) The issue of adding clauses on the division of provinces and regions in Chapter 11, (5) The election chapter, (6) The division of chapters on basic national policies, (7) The issue of adding a marriage clause to basic national policies, (8) In the education clause of basic national policies, stipulating that students must exceed party affiliation, (9) The definition of law, (10) The interpretation of the constitution, (11) The establishment of the constitution implementation procedures, (12) Adding the issue of supervising and promoting the implementation of the constitution. All discussions were completed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:20 pm. The review work has come to an end. The discussion process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of the number of people during the Legislative Yuan's reconsideration. The Organizing Committee believed that in accordance with the opinions of the Third Review Committee, Article 58 should be revised to state that the Executive Yuan has the responsibility to submit policy guidelines and policy reports to the Legislative Yuan, and legislators have the right to question the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan during the meeting. The words "all" in the second and third items were changed to "attendance." The chairman reported that the last discussion result was to decide to pass the principle and hand it over to the Organizing Committee. The result of the discussion on the number of people was two opinions: one was three-quarters of attendance and two-thirds of passage, and the other was two-thirds of attendance and two-thirds of agreement. Subsequently, Shi Shangkuan stood up and stated that the principle decided last time was three-quarters of attendance and two-thirds of passage. This principle has already been passed, and the Organizing Committee cannot change it in principle. Zeng Qi also said that Representative Pan Gongzhan had proposed the opinion of three-quarters attendance and two-thirds passage last time, and it had been passed. Even if it cannot be so, it can be two-thirds attendance and three-quarters passage, because it must have a majority vote.</p>
<p>Wang Xiuqing said that the reason why the number of people for reconsideration must be large is because if the Legislative Yuan passes it, the President of the Executive Yuan will inevitably resign. If it is passed rashly with a small number of people, it will cause the political situation to fluctuate from time to time. Therefore, I believe that it should be negotiated and then handed over to the General Assembly. Pan Gongzhan said: In principle, it has been passed. Today, one of the following two methods should be adopted: one is to formally propose reconsideration, and the other is not to propose reconsideration, that is, to negotiate again. Subsequently, Chen Kan made a statement saying: Three-quarters attendance and two-thirds passage seem to be a compromise, but it is not. Because the number of three-quarters attendance is too large, it will not be easy for the President of the Executive Yuan to change, and the Executive Yuan can be irresponsible to the Legislative Yuan. Later, the chairman made a statement saying: This issue is not worth paying too much attention to. From the party's standpoint, it is the minority party arguing for the majority party. In addition, if three-quarters is the attendance standard, the minority party can not attend. Therefore, if it is stipulated to be more than the majority party, it is not necessarily beneficial. This is not a party issue. At the same time, if the President of the Executive Yuan is indeed not good, whoever supports him is whoever is not good. If the Legislative Yuan has something that is too much for the Executive Yuan, it can be passed with a small number of people attending the meeting, but this case must still be submitted to the President. Therefore, if the parties attach importance to this case, they can try to urge their own people to participate more in advance. I believe that the spirit of this comprehensive meeting is very good, and there is no need to argue over this point.</p>
<p>(2) The issue of the number of legislators. Lei Zhen reported that in the original draft Article 65, some people believed that the first item on the total number was unsatisfactory, and the second was the separate listing of merchants, Tibetans, and Mongolians, because there were already special provisions. The rest were completely the same as the spirit of the original case. Therefore, there was no objection to passing the organizing committee's views. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Central Standing Committee of the Democratic League to be Held Soon</h3>

<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Luo Longji of the Democratic League had a long talk with Zhou Enlai on the evening of the 18th, and visited Zhang Qun again at 2 pm on the 19th. The plan to go to Shanghai on the 19th was postponed and changed to the night train on the 20th. Some people believe that his contact is related to peace talks.</p>

<h3>Minister Peng Tells Reporters Not to be Fooled by Rumors</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Minister Peng announced on the 19th that "according to the report on those who abducted our people, a certain party is planning to spread rumors and slander the Youth Party, the Social Democratic Party, and some National Assembly representatives, with the aim of making people dissatisfied with the National Assembly. I urge the press not to be fooled by it and lightly spread or forward it. We deeply know the importance of freedom of the press, but slander is not freedom of speech. Improper slander against a certain party is also contrary to the purpose of freedom of speech and violates the ethics of journalists."</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Flies to Nanjing</h3>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Attends Reception and Answers Questions on Constitution-Making and Diplomacy; Government to be Reorganized Immediately After National Assembly Closes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Chinese and foreign press conference of the Central Propaganda Department was held at 2 pm on the 19th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was invited to attend and answer questions on constitution-making and diplomacy. Wang said that he firmly believed that the principles and spirit of the constitution draft proposed by the government would be accepted by the National Assembly. Wang also praised the spirit of tolerance of the National Assembly representatives, believing that this conference fully demonstrated the restoration of the Chinese people's confidence in democracy and representative politics. When Wang expressed his personal views on the issue of constitution-making in the National Assembly, he said: The constitution-making work of the National Assembly has made extremely important progress. I am telling you today that I now firmly believe that the principles and spirit of the constitution draft will be accepted by the National Assembly. The General Assembly will definitely make some revisions, so that the amendments passed in the future will not, on the whole, discount the original draft, but improve it. There are several reasons for this development. The most important reason is that the National Assembly representatives have a spirit of tolerance. The spirit of tolerance is the first condition for the success of democratic politics. The majority should understand the views of the opponents with an open mind. It is not enough to just be open-minded, but also to have a spirit of tolerance. The Kuomintang members' promotion of the spirit of tolerance may be thanks to the Chinese Communist Party. We hope that the Chinese Communist Party will also learn a lesson. This conference fully demonstrates that the Chinese people have restored their confidence in democracy and representative politics. The failure of parliamentary politics in the early years of the Republic of China caused the general Chinese people to lose confidence in democracy. This was still the case before the War of Resistance. The restoration of confidence today is due to more than one reason, but I believe that the actual achievements of the National Political Council in the past eight years are a major reason for promoting this restoration of confidence. The powers of the Political Council were indeed not large enough, but the level of ability and political morality shown by the Political Council were not low. His eight years of hard work have gradually made people feel that democracy and representative politics are feasible in China. The failure in the early years of the Republic of China does not need to be repeated. I hope and believe that the constitution passed by this National Assembly can truly represent the will of the Chinese people and is the result of our thirty-five years of hard experience.</p>
<h3>General Assembly to Decide on Constitution Implementation Procedures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After expressing his personal views, Wang answered reporters' questions. Regarding the procedures for formulating the constitution, Wang said: The Comprehensive Review Committee is currently reviewing the opinions of the review results of each group separately, and then submitting them to the General Assembly for a vote item by item. After the General Assembly passes the entire draft constitution, it is still difficult to estimate when the General Assembly will complete this task. Personally, I estimate that it will take five days to a week to complete. Regarding the question of whether it is still possible to discuss when the amendments to the constitution draft are submitted for a vote, Minister Wang replied: The presidium is considering this matter. The reporter continued to ask how the status of the National Political Council would be after the National Assembly. Wang said: I am currently unable to answer. I am afraid that the government or the reorganized government will decide after the National Assembly closes. Regarding the order of government reorganization and government sending personnel to Yenan, Wang said: The reorganization of the government will begin after the National Assembly closes. Regarding sending personnel to Yenan, the government is considering it and has not made any decision. Wang continued to answer the question of constitution implementation, saying: He believed that the constitution implementation procedures should be decided at the General Assembly. Wang also said that the General Assembly seemed to be making a decision. The reporter continued to ask Wang, if some representatives were dissatisfied with the passed constitution and withdrew from the meeting, would the constitution itself be affected? Wang said: He believed that there would not be a withdrawal or a withdrawal of a majority of representatives. Even if a few withdrew, the constitution would not be affected. Finally, Wang answered the reporter's question about his personal opinion on including "Comply with the United Nations Charter" in the basic national policy, saying that he personally agreed to include it.</p>
<h3>Understanding Between the Chinese and Soviet Governments Has Indeed Progressed</h3>

<h3>International Monetary Fund Announces Legal Exchange Rates of Thirty Countries; Eight Countries Including China and Poland Are Permitted to Postpone Submitting</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The International Monetary Fund announced tonight: Transactions will begin at the exchange rates of various countries on March 1 of next year. Among the 39 member countries of the fund, 30 countries have submitted legal exchange rates. Eight countries, including Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, Greece, Poland, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, and East India, have applied for postponement of submission and have been approved. The significance of Uruguay also awaiting parliamentary approval before it can submit is not only that various countries announce their exchange rates, but also that the participating countries have established an agency to stabilize exchange rates. Except in accordance with the fund agreement, the legal exchange rates of their currencies cannot be changed, and this assistance will be used to complete the common purpose of the currency fund agreement. Various</p>
<p>Belgian Franc: 43.8275 francs equal to one U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Canadian Dollar: One dollar equals one U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>French Franc: 119.201 francs equal to one U.S. dollar. Dutch Guilder: 2.5528 guilders equal to one U.S. dollar. British and South African Commonwealth Gold Pound: 8.6545 pounds equal to one ounce of gold. 4.0258159 pounds equal to one U.S. dollar. Indian Rupee: 125.798 rupees equal to one ounce of gold, 3.30852 rupees equal to one U.S. dollar. These legal parities are based on current exchange rates, but the fund's acceptance of these exchange rates cannot be considered a guarantee that they will not change again.</p>

<h3>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Extends Relief Supplies to China until Next September, with One Hundred Ships En Route</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The sixth session of the UNRRA General Assembly concluded successfully in Washington last week. It is reported that the General Assembly unanimously approved the extension of UNRRA's relief supplies to China until next September. However, it stipulates that UNRRA's procurement of supplies in China should end by the end of next June, and in Europe by the end of March. If it cannot be completed by then, negotiations can be held with the respective countries to continue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, UNRRA is quite satisfied with the performance of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) in supplying materials to the Communist-controlled areas in the past two months. However, it still hopes to increase supply and transportation to achieve UNRRA's goal of fair distribution. UNRRA authorities also stated that they will continue to retain experienced technical personnel in China, Washington, and the respective European branches to assist in completing the transportation of supplies to China.</p>
<p>The last General Assembly meeting is scheduled to be held before the end of next June. If the members of the General Assembly deem it unnecessary at that time, it can also be canceled.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 18th] The new Director-General of UNRRA, Rooks, recently addressed UNRRA staff, stating that if UNRRA wants to complete its supply plan within the specified period, all staff must redouble their efforts to expedite the shipment of relief supplies that have not yet been shipped abroad. The total value of these relief supplies is between 600 million and 1 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] UNRRA announced that as of the 13th of this month, a total of 1,320,896 tons of supplies had been shipped to China. Last week, one ship unloaded 2,248 tons in Shanghai. This week, there are nine UNRRA ships, four in Shanghai, two in Hong Kong, two in Shantou, and one in Dagu, unloading cargo, totaling 19,408 tons. In addition, one hundred UNRRA ships are en route to China, of which ninety-one are carrying 223,794 tons of cargo, and the tonnage of the remaining nine is unknown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to CRRRA's announcement, in the week from December 7th to 13th, this agency transported a total of 3,703 tons of supplies to other locations. Food and industrial equipment still account for the majority, with the two items accounting for 82% of the total. This week, 3,784.40 tons of supplies were distributed locally in Shanghai, and a total of 7,488.20 tons were transported to other locations. The breakdown of supplies transported to other locations this week is as follows: Food: 1,833.76 tons, Clothing: 559.46 tons, Industrial Equipment: 885.45 tons, Agricultural Equipment: 133.92 tons, Medical Equipment: 301.21 tons, Total: 3,703.80 tons.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Guilin, 19th] The Guilin CRRRA branch transferred all 1.2 billion yuan of its eighth-term operating funds for other uses. The various counties and cities telegraphed requesting emergency allocations, but the branch refused and stated that it would not respond. The number of starving people dying in various places is increasing daily.</p>
<h3>To Have Peace in the Pacific, Assistance is Needed for Eastern Countries; American Branch of the Pacific Society Pays Attention to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 18th] The American branch of the Pacific Society held a regional conference near Monterey, California, last weekend. No less than 150 representatives participated, mostly educators, writers, and business people. Repeated discussions during the conference gave listeners the feeling that if peace is desired in the Pacific, Eastern countries must first be assisted to become self-sufficient, so that their people's lives can be improved and they will no longer want war. The United States seems to have a better understanding of the general situation in China than in other Eastern countries, and all debates often concluded with China. Although the situation in India is more complex, it received little attention. Someone suggested that the Chinese civil war be submitted to the United Nations for discussion. Shen Jianhong, director of the San Francisco office of the International Publicity Department of the Central Propaganda Department, immediately refuted this, stating that the economic imbalance and production stagnation in the United States could equally be submitted to the United Nations for review. Is it more tragic for people to die from civil war than to die from not being able to obtain food due to strikes in the American shipping and coal mining industries? This is a question. His stated opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Events occurring in any place are related to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>(2) The world cannot have peace if the East is turbulent and restless.</p>
<p>(3) Eastern countries cannot stabilize without outside assistance.</p>
<p>(4) According to the natural situation, most of this assistance should come from the United States. If the United States cannot maintain its own domestic security and production, where will the assistance come from? All parties agreed that no foreign country can help other nations improve their lives without first stabilizing its own domestic politics. The conference discussed the political struggles in various Far Eastern countries, and frequently mentioned the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union in their wake, especially in China, Korea, and Japan. However, although the Soviet Union is a Pacific country, this fundamental issue was never discussed in detail.</p>
<h3>Seventy Thousand Taels of Mexican Gold Arrive in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] Seventy thousand taels of Mexican gold arrived in Hong Kong via an American vessel. Previously, the amount of Mexican gold shipped to Hong Kong at any one time was no more than 40,000 taels. The large amount this time is due to the slight fluctuations in the price of gold in Hong Kong and various parts of the country. The cost of Mexican gold is more than 270 Hong Kong dollars per tael. According to the current market price here, it can be sold in Hong Kong for a profit of more than 30 Hong Kong dollars per tael. Therefore, the financial community is competing to telegraph orders. It is estimated that in the past three months, an average of 100,000 taels of Mexican gold have been shipped to Hong Kong each month. Hong Kong has not digested much, and it is all being smuggled to various parts of the country for profit.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Smuggling</h3>
<p>Customs Trade Statistics are No Longer Accurate</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 19th] The Far Eastern Economic Review reported today that smuggling in China is rampant, and customs statistics are no longer reliable as a basis for analyzing China's trade. The customs' prevention plans are no match for highly efficient smuggling organizations, and the ever-increasing regulations and restrictions only serve to bother legitimate merchants. The report cited the Macau customs as an example, stating that the trade between China and Portugal that the local customs can register is less than 20% of the actual figures, and there are hundreds of armed smuggling motorboats. The article also stated that although the import of cosmetics was banned nine months ago, the amount of inventory smuggled in is still enough to supply the Shanghai market for several years.</p>
<h3>China and Argentina Negotiating a Trade Agreement</h3>

<h3>The Philippines' Market Filipinization Act: China Formally Lodges a Protest, China-Philippines Trade Agreement to be Signed Before Christmas</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 19th] According to an official announcement today, Chen Zhiping, the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, recently submitted a formal letter of protest from the Chinese government to President Roxas, protesting the Philippine government's law giving Filipinos priority in setting up stalls in the Manila market (i.e., the Market Filipinization Act). The law will be implemented starting next year, affecting 1,045 Chinese vendors in the city's eleven markets. Chen strongly argued that the law is a discriminatory measure specifically aimed at the Chinese in Manila, because only the Chinese set up stalls in the market among foreigners.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 19th] Philippine Vice President Quirino revealed today that the trade agreement between China and the Philippines will be signed before Christmas. The Chinese government has submitted several proposed amendments, which have been handled by officials from both countries. From the looks of it, the signing will take place in Malacañang Palace (the seat of the Philippine government) by Philippine President Roxas or Quirino, and Chen Zhiping, the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, will represent China. This is the first time the Philippines has signed a trade agreement. The first trade agreement was concluded with the United States.</p>

The highway several miles outside the city was destroyed by the Communist army, and vehicles cannot pass.

In addition, more than 3,000 Communist troops were found near Lutai Station.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 19th] On both sides of the Pingjin Railway, the National Army launched a counterattack to prevent the Communist army from harassing, and made rapid progress. The threat made by the Communist army has been lifted.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Shenyang, 19th] The southern section of the China-Chang Railway reconstruction project is now eight kilometers away from Xiongyue, and traffic between Gaiping and Xiongyue can be restored in the short term. In addition, the railway employees and some Soviet expatriates who were evacuated from Shenchang are now on standby in Datong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 19th] The Communist army in northern Liaoning once again destroyed the railway bridge near Kaoshantun, 274 kilometers from the Shenji Railway, on the night of the 19th.

<h3>The Quantity of Petroleum Refined by Our Own Country Will Increase Greatly Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The quantity of petroleum self-made and refined in our country next year will be greatly increased. This is because the Northeast Oil Refinery in Jinzhou will start construction next spring. The Japanese naval oil refinery, which imports crude oil from North China and receives it in Kaohsiung, will resume operation at about the same time. It is hoped that crude oil will be obtained from Iran, and negotiations have been going on for a long time; it is now learned that agreement has been reached in principle, and only the transportation problem remains to be discussed in detail. The decision on the petroleum import quota will largely refer to the customs import figures in the past year, and the China Petroleum Corporation has also contributed its opinions on this issue. In general, there will be considerable flexibility in the quota for oil for special purposes. Among the three major companies currently supplying petroleum to our country, Texaco is in the leading position.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reaffirmation of America's China Policy</h3>
<p>President Truman made a statement on the 18th, reiterating that the U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged and that the declaration on China policy issued on December 15th of last year remains in effect. He solemnly declared the following: (1) U.S. troops are stationed in China at the request of the National Government to assist China in repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war and in restoring domestic peace and order. The number of U.S. troops has been reduced from 113,000 to 12,000. (2) Recognizing China as an autonomous and independent country and recognizing the National Government as the sole legitimate government of China, the United States should support it. Once domestic peace is restored in China, the United States will intensify its assistance to China's economic recovery and reform to promote Sino-U.S. business relations. (3) Special Envoy Marshall's mediation of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been quite successful. Although the KMT-CPC negotiations have now broken down, it is still necessary for Special Envoy Marshall to remain in China. (4) While the U.S. position in China must avoid being drawn into the vortex of China's internal strife, it must still maintain its policy of assisting the Chinese people in restoring domestic peace and reviving the economy. (5) The United States will not interfere in China's internal affairs. (6) He expressed approval of the political negotiation resolutions and the military reorganization plan but expressed regret that China had failed to achieve the goal of political and military unification through peaceful means. (7) He urged China to stop the civil war, believing that a unified and peaceful China is of utmost importance to world peace. Therefore, China has a responsibility to other United Nations members to stop its internal strife and hopes that the Chinese government can find a peaceful solution to the KMT-CPC dispute.</p>
<p>President Truman's lengthy statement should be regarded as a declaration that the U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged, which can have a clarifying effect on public opinion circles in both China and the United States. Especially in the United States, two or three months ago, there was a "U.S. Withdrawal from China" propaganda week, which made a great deal of noise, saying that the presence of U.S. troops in China would only fuel China's internal strife. Recently, Mr. Vincent, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the U.S. State Department, also issued a statement advising Americans not to invest in China. The day before yesterday, two senators jointly requested the government to stop its efforts to mediate China's internal strife alone and advocated convening a conference of the three major powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, to implement what they called "joint mediation." The complexity of opinions in American public opinion circles can be seen from this. However, most Americans have always believed that the United States has a significant responsibility for world peace and an unshirkable responsibility for the creation of peace in the Far East. In particular, it should fulfill the promises it made to China during the war and actively assist China in becoming a strong, unified, and democratic country. President Truman's statement was aimed at these complex opinions and will enable the American people to fully understand what policy the United States should adopt toward China. In a nutshell, the United States should continue to adopt its active and realistic China policy. This simple, clear, and straightforward expression should make those self-proclaimed "Far East experts" think less and offer fewer "timely suggestions."</p>
<p>At the same time, it can also have a clarifying effect in China, enough to awaken those who fantasize that the U.S. policy toward China is about to change from their daydreams. Since June of this year, the Chinese Communist Party has continuously launched anti-American propaganda in newspapers, in writing, and in action, in an attempt to cause misperceptions in American public opinion circles and force the government to change its policy toward China. Although it failed, it still harbors considerable hope. As long as the American people have any proposals, it is overjoyed, especially regarding the suggestions of U.S. Senators Wiley and Flanders, expressing great importance to them. Little do they know that these are the private views of the two senators and are not enough to represent the views of the U.S. government and the public. After reading the full text of President Truman's statement, it can be known that one should not harbor any illusions about American policy.</p>
<p>Leaving aside all other factors, just in terms of the wishes of the people of China and the United States, the U.S. policy toward China will not change. What the United States expects of China is to become a strong, unified, and democratic country, becoming the only stable element in the Far East. President Truman said, "I believe that the wishes of the American people for China are exactly the same as the urgent hopes of the Chinese people themselves." This well-reasoned saying is truly worth our deep thought and understanding.</p>
<p>During China's War of Resistance against Japan, the United States not only expressed sympathy in spirit for China's arduous resistance but also provided material assistance at the earliest stage. In the end, China and the United States fought side by side, fighting to the end with the aggressor Japanese imperialism. Therefore, China's military turnaround from defeat to victory must be said to have relied on the strength of the United States. But why was the United States willing to assist China with all its strength to resist Japanese aggression? This is due to the common wish that the American people have for China. Everyone believes that China is a peace-loving country and should be the cornerstone of peace in the Far East. During the War of Resistance, China should be assisted at any cost to defeat the aggressors who disrupt peace in the Far East. After the victory of the War of Resistance, China should also be assisted in achieving peace and stability and embarking on the path of unification, peace, and democracy. The stationing of U.S. troops in China certainly held this mission, and Special Envoy Marshall's visit to China to mediate the KMT-CPC issue was even more to achieve this goal. In China, after eight years of arduous resistance, it was already exhausted and desperately needed to recuperate and devote itself to national construction and reconstruction in an atmosphere of peace after the victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, there is no one in the country who does not long for peace or unification. At the same time, in order to permanently eliminate internal strife, there is no one who does not hope for "political democratization" and "nationalization of the military." This expression of public opinion finally led to the success of the Political Consultative Conference, which not only passed the "Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction" but also established a military reorganization plan. Originally, after the ceasefire order was issued, China's future was full of infinite new hopes. However, the Chinese Communist Party, which had other intentions, did not hesitate to undermine the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and violate the military reorganization plan, making it impossible to achieve domestic peace. Although peace talks were still conducted afterward, they failed to achieve success, not only causing pain and suffering to the Chinese people but also greatly disappointing the people of the United States. Therefore, President Truman had no choice but to attribute the responsibility for the breakdown of the peace talks to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>The KMT-CPC issue is China's own business and should be resolved by its own means. However, because the wishes of the American people for China are exactly the same as the expectations of the Chinese people for themselves, we request the stationing of U.S. troops in China and welcome Mediator Marshall to travel around China for peace. Conversely, if someone advocates convening an international conference to resolve China's internal strife, not only is this suggestion untimely and impractical, but it also carries the suspicion of international interference and is by no means acceptable to the people of an independent and self-reliant country.</p>
<p>In short, President Truman's statement that U.S. policy toward China is still based on the declaration of December 15 of last year is not only welcomed by the Chinese people under the current international environment but also welcomed by Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. We only hope that China's political situation can also improve as the international situation improves.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Truman's Statement The above article continues from the first edition</h3>
<p>At a time when large-scale aid was being delayed, this government completed its wartime lend-lease commitments to China. Lend-lease aid was given to China to help it fight the Japanese and later to help China recover Japanese-occupied territories. The aid included goods, equipment, and services, half of which were services, such as air and sea transportation of troops.</p>
<p>According to recent figures, the total value of lend-lease aid from the United States to China up to Victory over Japan Day was $870,000,000. From Victory over Japan Day to the end of February (shortly after Marshall arrived in China), the total was $602,000,000, most of which was used for transportation costs. Since then, the lend-lease program has been reduced, limited to completing unfinished tasks, but most of them have been discontinued later.</p>
<p>Disposal of Surplus Materials Completed</p>
<p>As a result of the disposal of surplus materials under the agreement we reached with China, a large number of civilian materials have been prepared. This has allowed us to clear many accounts and dispose of a lot of surplus materials.</p>
<p>During the war, the Chinese government provided U.S. troops with national currency for construction, equipment, troop support, and other uses. At the end of the war, the debt in this regard reached 150,000,000,000 Chinese national currency. Because of the incessant Chinese currency inflation, we cannot accurately determine the value of this figure in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>China agreed to purchase all U.S. surplus materials (with a few exceptions) within China and on seventeen islands and bases in the Pacific. The agreement to purchase surplus materials was finally signed in August, after six months of negotiations. It was particularly urgent to complete this work in the Pacific, especially since materials in open-air warehouses in tropical climates are easily damaged, and the Chinese people are in great need of these surplus materials. U.S. aircraft outside China, all non-demilitarized combat materials, and fixed equipment were not included in the purchase, so the agreement should not allow any weapons to flow into the civil war.</p>
<p>In addition to $300 million, the Chinese government wrote off all of our debt for misappropriating its national currency and agreed to allocate funds equivalent to $35 million for the use of the U.S. government within China and for the acquisition or improvement of buildings and assets needed for our diplomatic and consular affairs. Another $20 million was allocated for the implementation of cultural education programs.</p>
<p>KMT-CPC Negotiations Disappointing</p>
<p>Before Marshall's second arrival in China in April, there were signs that the ceasefire agreement had been flouted. The sincere and unremitting efforts of the Executive Headquarters and its teams resulted in the cessation of local conflicts in many places, and countless lives were spared. However, new conflicts continued to occur. After the communist army occupied Changchun, the Northeast also fell into a crisis of chaos, and the National Government did not fully agree to send an executive team to Changchun.</p>
<p>The political situation has also changed, which is equally disappointing. Negotiations between the KMT and the Communist Party have reopened time and again, but they have often broken down. Although the final hope of successful negotiations has not completely disappeared, the agreements reached in January and February have not been implemented, and several Chinese parties have failed to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Task of Repatriating Japanese Completed</p>
<p>In other areas, there has also been exciting progress, especially in clearing out the Japanese in China. In accordance with the Allied agreement, China was responsible for disarming all Japanese military personnel and repatriating Japanese residents and military personnel from China, Taiwan, and Vietnam (north of latitude 16 degrees). Our government allowed China to assist in this task. The scope of this work was extreme, with a total of three million Japanese waiting to be evacuated, half of whom were naval and army personnel. Maritime and rail transport was destroyed or stalled, port facilities were also heavily damaged, and there was an excessive amount of relief and other materials. The Japanese had to be disarmed, concentrated, and then sent to the nearest port. In some cases, the distances were very far. At the ports, the Japanese were individually screened and given physical examinations, and they were vaccinated. Isolation hospitals were established at the ports to deal with infectious diseases, such as Asian cholera. Finally, all three million people had to be transported back to Japan by sea.</p>
<p>U.S. troops helped to disarm the Japanese army. The Executive Headquarters and its teams completed complex procedures to allow the Japanese army to pass through and move from the civil war zone to the embarkation port. U.S. teams also participated in port inspections, and U.S. medical units guided all vaccinations and other medical work. Finally, U.S. and Japanese ships belonging to the Seventh Fleet transported this large number of people to Japanese ports. At the end of last year, 200,000 Japanese were repatriated, leaving Chinese ports at a rate of 2,500 per day. In March of this year, due to the rapid and expanded efforts of the U.S. military and Chinese authorities, the rate of Japanese leaving China increased to 20,000 per day. By October, 2,986,438 Japanese had been repatriated, and this plan was considered to have come to an end. Except for an unknown number of Japanese in some locations in Manchuria, the remaining Japanese were only some war criminals and technicians retained by the Chinese government. Under the conditions of civil war, transportation destruction, and other difficulties, this great task was finally completed, becoming an outstanding example of Sino-U.S. cooperation for a common goal.</p>
<p>Number of U.S. Troops in China Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>There have been many criticisms of the U.S. military presence in China last year. In the autumn of last year, the number of U.S. troops stationed in China was quite large, and it should have been quite large. No one dared to predict the extent to which the Japanese army in China would obey the surrender terms. We should have sent troops to help China in times of difficulty. When it became clear that the Chinese army could deal with the surrendered Japanese army, the U.S. military in China immediately began to demobilize.</p>
<p>The main responsibility of the U.S. military was to assist in the evacuation of the Japanese, a task that was prolonged due to local environmental problems. The Executive Headquarters and the ceasefire teams also needed a large number of Americans, especially because the important radio and other transportation work was almost entirely maintained by the U.S. The Executive Headquarters was located in Beiping, only a hundred miles from the coast, and the city was prone to local conflicts. Therefore, another responsibility of the U.S. was to protect the supply lines of the Executive Headquarters. Another task of the U.S. military after the Japanese surrender was to provide the necessary protection to ensure that the coal produced by the large coal mines northeast of Tianjin could reach the seaports to supply the cities and railways in central China. This coal was necessary to prevent the collapse of the industrial zone in central China. Our Marines completed this task in September. The task of other U.S. troops was to find the remains and graves of U.S. soldiers who died in China during the war against Japan. There were also other U.S. troops who had to guard U.S. equipment and equipment storage facilities and find ways to transport them back or sell them as surplus materials.</p>
<p>The maximum strength of U.S. troops stationed in China a year ago was 113,000. Today, this number has begun to decrease to less than 12,000, including 2,000 U.S. troops directly related to the Executive Headquarters. This number will be further reduced until the minimum number required by the Executive Headquarters and the U.S. military in Qingdao to maintain supply and security is reached.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the past year, we have made a lot of progress in helping China repatriate the Japanese and have been able to withdraw most of the troops stationed abroad. We have also done a considerable amount of work in helping China receive the recovered areas. We have taken some emergency steps of economic assistance to prevent the Chinese economy from collapsing and have cleared up our own wartime financial accounts in China.</p>
<p>No Intention of Interfering in China's Internal Affairs</p>
<p>It is a great pity that China has so far failed to find a way to unite and achieve peace. Because Marshall understands the seriousness of the problem and the importance of finding a solution, he remains at his post, even in the case where negotiations have been interrupted by the CCP. We will continue to assist China in moving towards peace and a truly democratic government.</p>
<p>The views expressed by this government a year ago remain true today. The political unity plan agreed to in February is sound. The fighting since April has made the military unity plan of February difficult to implement, but the general principles within the plan are sound. China is a sovereign and complete country. We recognize this fact, and we also recognize the National Government of China. We continue to hope that the government will find a peaceful solution. We have no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs. Our position is clear. While avoiding being drawn into internal strife, we will maintain our policy of assisting the Chinese people in their quest for national peace and economic revival.</p>
<p>We are giving careful and sympathetic consideration to the methods and tools of creative assistance to China. The recent agricultural mission to China is one example of this assistance. The U.S. agricultural mission to China was led by Hutchinson of the University of California, and China organized a joint Sino-U.S. Agricultural Cooperation Committee, of which the Hutchinson Mission is a part. The country's proposals have been provided to the Chinese government, and we are prepared to assist China in implementing these proposals. As the situation in China improves, we are prepared to consider assisting in the implementation of other plans unrelated to internal strife. This plan will encourage China's economic reconstruction and reform, thereby increasing Sino-U.S. business relations.</p>
<p>We believe that our hopes for China are fully in line with the most ardent wishes of the Chinese people themselves. Therefore, we will continue our active and practical policy towards China. This policy is still based on full respect for its national sovereignty and our traditional friendship with the Chinese people. The goal of this policy is to promote international peace.</p>

<h3>Seriously Ill Traitor Ma Liang Carried into Court, Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for 21st Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan News] Ma Liang (Zi Zizhen), who once served as the puppet Shandong Provincial Governor and puppet North China Political Affairs Committee Member, was publicly tried in the Second Criminal Court of the High Court at 3 PM on the 16th of this month. The news spread, and many people went to attend the hearing. Traitor Ma, due to illness, could not walk and was carried into the court on a bamboo bed. Five of his family members followed him. When the court opened, Traitor Ma was still lying down. His wife, Ma Dang, and his son, Ma Zuozhang, stood on either side of the bed. Presiding Judge Li Faxian asked him his name, but he pretended to be deaf and mute, not saying a word. His son, Ma Zuozhang, then requested to act as an assistant to defend him. Prosecutor Li Huangeng stood up and accused him of his crimes, stating that after Jinan fell, Traitor Ma was the first to initiate the organization of the Maintenance Association, serving as its chairman. He was extremely flattering to the enemy. Then, in the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he organized the puppet Shandong Provincial Government, serving as the Provincial Governor, and concurrently served as a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], he resigned from his position as the puppet Provincial Governor and went to Beiping to serve exclusively as a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee. Traitor Ma remained in the puppet government until two years before the victory. During his time in the puppet government, Traitor Ma established a puppet government and promoted enemy and puppet political orders, which were beneficial to the enemy country and detrimental to our own country. The court is requested to investigate and handle the case according to law. Then, Judge Li questioned him in detail. Ma Zuozhang's answers to the court's questions about the crimes were like reciting a formula, all claiming that they were orders from the provisional government and forced by Japanese advisors. Finally, the defendant's lawyer, Hou Hanqing, defended him for three hours. The interrogation ended at 6 PM, and the sentencing was scheduled for 2 PM on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Famous People on Trial Creates a Sensation in Suzhou City; Fan Junbo and Others' Extortion and Fraud Case Investigated, Courtroom Extremely Polite and Accommodating</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou, 19th Telegram] The Wudi District Court Prosecutor's Office investigated the sensational extortion and fraud case involving local figures Fan Junbo and others for the tenth time on the 19th. At 9 AM sharp, reporters from various local and foreign newspapers gathered at the District Court, competing to cover this rarely seen news. At 9:15, the central figure, Fan Junbo, along with Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, Wu Bingzhang, and those involved in the case, Lu Shaofen, Yu Zhaomo, Jiang Nanxian, Chen Yagu, Xu Songru, Yu Jifu, Wang Weirang, Zhang Zhiyu, Wang Zimu, and others, a total of thirteen people (the remaining four, Wang Weichang, Zai Xianzhe, Jin Jiliang, and Zhu Dinglian, did not arrive), arrived at the District Court at the same time. After reporting to the bailiffs' office, they all retreated to the Shengyanglou teahouse next to the District Court to rest. Fan, Lu Shaofen, and Lu Wang Wu sat at one square table, sampling tea and talking cordially. The other nine gathered at a long table. At 9:30, Prosecutor Xiao Qi took the bench in the Second Investigative Court and ordered the bailiffs to summon Fan and others for questioning. The thirteen people then entered the court at the same time. Except for Fan Junbo, who entered the court first, the other twelve did not go to the waiting room. The bailiffs politely directed them to the Joint Court-Prosecutor's Club, where they sat and waited to be summoned. The servants provided tea attentively and were very respectful, which was different from the treatment of ordinary defendants. Reporters from various newspapers were scattered around the investigative court, hoping to hear some of the inside story of the investigation through cracks in the walls and windows, but the answers were barely audible. After about forty minutes, the court ordered the twelve people, including Lu Tiesun, to be questioned in turn. However, although they were questioned individually, they did not leave the court individually after being questioned, and they all waited in the court. The investigation came to an end at 12:30. The court ordered Fan Junbo to provide two reliable shopkeepers as guarantors, and Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang to each provide one shopkeeper as guarantor pending further investigation. The other nine, including Lu Shaofen, were ordered to return. After leaving the court, Fan and others returned to their residences for lunch without completing the procedures. The guarantor matters will be supplemented in the afternoon. This is also an unusual example, because Fan Junbo and others are Suzhou's most prestigious merchants and gentry. After the adjournment, our reporter inquired about the investigation from all sides. It is reported that Fan claimed that the original statement was inaccurate and argued that the six million yuan was privately requested by Li Zhenji Tailor Shop, which undertook the production of uniforms around the Double Tenth Festival [October 10th], because it lacked sewing cloth fees. Lu Tiesun and others agreed to provide the loan, but they did not know that it was an average fundraising. Moreover, the funds had been returned earlier because Li Zhenji no longer needed them. The Suzhou community is closely watching the development of this case.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial County Magistrate Examination to Begin Today</h3>

<h3>Two Bandit Suppression Agencies, Taihu Bandit Suppression Command and Chengxi Joint Defense Command, Ordered to be Abolished</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou, 19th Telegram] The Wuxi Command believes that after three months of bandit suppression in the Taihu area, there are no traces of bandits. Only a part of the remaining bandits, led by Xue Yonghui, are disrupting the area near the third and fourth districts of Su County. There is no need for a large agency to deal with them specifically. Therefore, on the 19th, it ordered the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command to be abolished immediately. The remaining work will be taken over by the Su County Government, especially the part of suppressing the Xue bandits, and the County Government is strictly limited to completing it within a specified period.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin News] The Chengxi Joint Defense Command, which has been established for more than four months, has now been ordered to be abolished. In the future, the responsibility for local security and unfinished matters will be transferred to the County Government. The Jiangfang task will still be undertaken by the Fortress Commander.</p>
<h3>Li Pinhe Appointed Mayor of Bengbu</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei News] After the victory, the Provincial Government planned to establish cities in Bengbu, Anqing, and Wuhu and appointed Li Pinhe, Zhang Weixia, and others to be responsible for the preparations.

It has now been decided that the city government will be officially established on New Year's Day [January 1st] of next year. The candidate for mayor was decided at the Provincial Government's routine meeting on the 16th. Li Pinhe, the original Director of the Municipal Preparatory Office, was promoted. The city government's organizational regulations were also approved.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Winter Defense in Lanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanxi Dispatch] The first winter defense area of this county held a winter defense meeting on the 13th at the county government, deciding on five items: (1) During the winter defense period, patrols will be jointly organized by the garrisoned National Army, Provincial Security Team, and Police Bureau to be responsible for patrols.

<h3>Pinghu to Issue Grain Loans Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pinghu Dispatch] The Ministry of Food, recognizing the low grain prices in rural areas that are approaching bankruptcy, has adopted opinions from various parties to implement grain loans to rescue the situation. Zhejiang Province's share of the loan is 5 billion yuan. The province has determined that each county in the ten districts will receive between 500 million and 750 million yuan. This county accounts for 17% to 18% of the total amount for the ten districts, and can obtain 90 million to 120 million yuan. It is reported that once the loan amount is approved, it will be released in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Flour Industry Completely Collapses; Eleven Mills Shut Down in Three Days, Only Flour King's Mill Remains Open</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi Dispatch] The industry and commerce of this county have recently been affected by the economic downturn, making it impossible to maintain operations, resulting in daily bankruptcies. Those who are still operating normally are also superficially strong but internally weak, on the verge of collapse. As the end of the year approaches, the crisis is even more severe. In the last three days, as many as eleven flour mills in the county have shut down. These include Hua Xin, Guang Feng, Zeng Feng, Tai Ji, Zhen Hua, Yong An, Min Feng, Ju Feng Sheng, Nian Feng, Tian Hua, and Tian Xin. Problems have also arisen with the severance pay for all workers. Currently, only Mao Xin, owned by Rong Desheng, the Flour King, remains open.</p>
<h3>Chongming Strictly Prohibits Township Levies</h3>

<h3>Chongming Supplements Conscription Quota, Qingpu Issues Family Support Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongming Dispatch] Of the 750 volunteer soldiers for the 35th year of the Republic in this county, 500 qualified and were sent to Nantong for training, leaving a shortage of 250. As many applied for exemption or deferment, the review took time, so the drawing was delayed. Ding Xuexian, Chief of Staff from the Nantong Garrison Command, made a special trip to Chongming to supervise the handling of the matter. According to Ding, the 250 missing conscripts will no longer be sent to Tong, but will be trained in the county for six months before being discharged.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingpu Dispatch] The family support fund for the 250 conscripted soldiers in this county, at 20,000 yuan per person, has been issued by the superiors to the county and will begin to be distributed on the 18th.

<h3>Suzhou Arrests Troublemaker</h3>
<p>One Arrested, Prosecution Initiated</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou Dispatch] The Chaoyanglou Teahouse across from the Suzhou Wu County District Court has long been frequented by troublemakers who solicit lawsuits from others, drafting complaints and profiting from it. Occasionally, they defraud and intimidate ignorant villagers without restraint. Recently, the District Court Prosecutor's Office learned of this and ordered the court police to conduct a sudden search. They arrested Chen Wuchi, a troublemaker, on the spot and confiscated several draft complaints from his person, taking them all into custody. The District Court Prosecutor's Office, with solid evidence, has initiated a public prosecution in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Jiading Rumors of Conscription Disrupt Social Tranquility</h3>

<h3>Iranian Government Willing to Fulfill Promise, Oil Rights for Five Northern Provinces Granted to Soviet Union, National General Election Scheduled for This Sunday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 18th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh stated today that he will fulfill his promise to the Soviet Union and submit a bill to parliament to grant the Soviet Union oil exploration rights in the five northern provinces of Iran. Sultaneh also stated that the national election is expected to be held this Sunday. The government party recently reorganized into the Democratic Party and is gaining momentum, while the leftist Workers' Party is weakening. The Democratic Party of Azerbaijan Province has ceased to exist. The new parliamentary election may take three months to complete. The original plan to complete it by the 21st of this month was delayed because the Azerbaijan provincial government defied orders and refused to allow government troops to enter to supervise the election, leading to repeated clashes. Sultaneh believes that Azerbaijan Governor Bishivari has fled to the Soviet Union with other personnel, and whether to request extradition has not been decided.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] Moscow Radio announced today that Iranian government troops massacred hundreds of residents in Azerbaijan province and incited "attacks" on Soviet nationals residing in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan.

<h3>Security Council Discusses Greek Complaint, US Representative Proposes Forming a Seven-Member Team for On-Site Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 19th Broadcasting: An hour ago, the Security Council convened a meeting to discuss the proposal to send a delegation to the Greek border for investigation. It is expected that if the Soviet representative does not use the veto power, the US proposal will be passed. Also, a few hours before the Security Council meeting, Greece submitted a large number of documentary evidence to the Council, accusing South, Bulgaria and Albania of assisting guerrillas.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] The Security Council today continued to debate Greece's complaint against South, Bulgaria, and Albania for assisting Greek guerrillas. The South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Cassanovi, directly pointed out that the guerrillas were concentrated in Greece and armed to disrupt the security of the Balkans. He said that Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris believed that the best way to promote good relations between Greece and South Korea was to concentrate and arm the war criminals and traitors of Yugoslavia to disrupt the peace of the Balkans. Tsaldaris's ability to come to power was due to the support of the United Kingdom. Therefore, this phenomenon not only harms the Greek people, but also harms the reputation of the United Kingdom, and it is necessary to investigate the domestic situation in Greece. US Representative Johnson then proposed a resolution asking the Security Council to send five permanent directors, plus Poland and Brazil, to form an investigation team to go to the investigation before January 15. If necessary, they should investigate the kingdom of the four countries of Greece, South Korea, and Albania, and submit a report to the Security Council as soon as possible. US Representative Johnson said that this trial should be handled by the Security Council, and its results are of great importance to the future of the United Nations organization. Similar border encroachment cases must not be ignored by the Security Council. In order to clarify the truth, the Security Council should conduct an investigation immediately. British Representative Jaddigan also believed that the situation in the area where the four countries border was dangerous, and the spark of fire could become a prairie fire, so the Security Council should conduct an investigation first to make a decision. Representatives from Australia and Brazil also expressed their support. It is understood that Bulgaria and Albania, although not members of the United Nations, have agreed to accept the Security Council's ruling in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. Today's meeting was adjourned to tomorrow at the insistence of Soviet Representative Gromyko. Johnson requested that the meeting continue in the afternoon, but Gromyko replied that he was inconvenient.</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the Legal Council Passes Strong Measures</h3>
<p>New and Old Foreign Ministers Hold Handover Ceremony</p>

<h3>International Changes: Talking About the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's attitude has recently become more moderate. Whether this will last is difficult to say at this time. The first test will be at the Atomic Energy Commission meeting in a few weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 18th] The Council of Foreign Ministers and the United Nations institutions in the past "nine hundred and forty-six, ten months, and three weeks have only been pessimistic; every step forward is followed by a step back. The Soviet Union seems determined to turn international conferences into propaganda forums. British Prime Minister Attlee made a final effort to go to Paris this summer, hoping for Soviet cooperation, but its effectiveness seems minimal. The Paris Conference and the first five weeks of the New York Conference seem to have only strengthened the division between the Soviet Union and the English-speaking countries? Until four weeks ago, the Soviet Union gradually showed softening, and once an agreement was reached on the troop reduction plan, it no longer demanded veto power over the decision on the implementation mechanism. It also showed compromise on issues such as the Trieste port issue and free navigation on the Danube River, and after proposing universal disarmament, it began to demobilize its large army stationed in the occupied areas of Europe. The Soviet Union has also admitted some failures, such as saying that all members of the United Nations cut off diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco government and investigated foreign troops stationed in various countries. Its attitude has been better than before, and it has not angrily walked out of the meeting. The Soviet Union has also expressed its willingness to lose its political position in Iranian Azerbaijan Province rather than cause another dispute. The Delhi government was determined to take strong action. Within a few days, without a major war, it eliminated the Azerbaijan provincial government supported by the Soviet Union, reopening a province that had been virtually isolated from the rest of Iran for a long time. The reasons for the Soviet Union's change of attitude and whether it will last have naturally aroused much speculation. Some representatives of the United Nations General Assembly pointed out that the Soviet Union's farms and factories need its army, which serves as a backing for military diplomacy, to return home to work. The implementation of the five-year plan requires foreign economic assistance, and it feels that its previous attitude has aroused resentment in various countries and is of no benefit to itself. Some people also hope that Soviet diplomats will gradually feel that Western countries are more trustworthy after working together for a long time. As for whether the Soviet Union's new attitude will last, this question largely depends on the value of other developments during the New York Conference, the most important of which is the universal disarmament plan. The General Assembly has asked the Security Council to decide how to establish control and inspection agencies and establish United Nations peacekeeping forces. The Soviet Union can recognize the guarantees that the United States must obtain before disclosing atomic energy secrets, or the Soviet Union attaches too much importance to its sovereignty, is too afraid of foreign supervision, and is too confident that the United States will never use atomic bombs against it in the foreseeable future, thereby hindering all necessary actions. The first test will be at the Atomic Energy Commission meeting in a few weeks. At the same time, the pessimism deeply hidden at the opening of the New York Conference has changed to hope, although it is still inevitably subject to limitations.</p>
<p>US-Soviet Signature</p>
<h3>Agreement to Repatriate Japanese People Stipulates That 50,000 People Will Be Sent to Soviet Territory Each Month, the Total Number Being About 1.5 Million</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] MacArthur's headquarters today signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to return 50,000 Japanese people from the Soviet Union each month. There are currently 1.5 million Japanese people in the Soviet occupation zone. U.S. representative Acheson repeatedly questioned Soviet representative Tryefyanenko at the Allied Council for Japan Control Committee because the Soviet Union refused to repatriate them. According to the agreement signed by MacArthur's Chief of Staff Mueller and Trifeenko today, Japanese prisoners of war and other Japanese people who wish to return to their country will return to Japan from Soviet ports on ships from MacArthur's headquarters. The quota is set at 50,000 people per month. Headquarters has sufficient ships, capable of transporting 560,000 people per month, but the Soviet side only limits it to 50,000 people. MacArthur's headquarters established a temporary agreement with the Soviet Union last month to repatriate Japanese people from Siberia, Dalian, and Korea. So far, 17,000 people have returned home. Repatriated Japanese people are only allowed to carry personal belongings permitted by customs regulations, not exceeding 100 kilograms per person. Officers are limited to carrying 500 Japanese yen, soldiers 200 yen, and civilians 1,000 yen. Postal savings books, bank deposit books, and other instruments issued by Japanese financial institutions for payment in Japan are allowed to be carried back home.</p>
<h3>Far East Commission Permits Japanese Trade Union Activities</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] The Far East Commission agreed today that Japanese workers should be encouraged to organize trade unions voluntarily and should be allowed to participate in political activities and support political parties.

U.S. officials said this expands the U.S. government's previous instructions to MacArthur, but there is no major discrepancy with U.S. policy. The U.S.'s previous instructions to MacArthur did not mention trade union political activities, but in accordance with civil rights, Japanese trade unions can engage in political activities. The Far East Commission also stated that the occupying authorities may only prohibit strikes when they directly hinder the goals of the occupation or are otherwise necessary. Employers may not refuse to give work to trade union members, and employers may not participate in the organization and actions of trade unions.</p>

<h3>Municipal Construction Donation: Intended for Long-Term Collection Will be Proposed at the Municipal Affairs Meeting This Morning</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The municipal construction donation currently collected in the city is temporary in nature. The First Senate decided in the meeting that if the city's financial situation improves in the next year, it must find other ways to increase revenue and abolish the municipal construction donation. According to reporters' investigations with relevant parties: the Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the city's economic situation may not be sufficient for a while, so it intends to include the municipal construction donation in the special tax revenue item in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, so that it can be collected for a long time to maintain municipal administration. It is heard that the Finance Bureau will put forward this proposal at this morning's municipal affairs meeting. After it is passed, it will be submitted to the Second Municipal Senate for deliberation.</p>
<p>According to reliable information: Because a large amount of business tax has been leaked recently, the Finance Bureau intends to uniformly print invoices and order all stores in the city to adopt them. It is heard that the Finance Bureau will also put forward this method at this morning's municipal affairs meeting. If this new facility can be passed, tax revenue can increase by a huge amount.</p>

<h3>Qian Tianhe Returns to Shanghai from the United States, Talks About the World Food Bureau, I Also Welcome the Wheat Conference</h3>
<p>Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Qian Tianhe was sent abroad in mid-May this year to attend the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Conference, the Emergency Food Conference held in Washington on May 19, and the Second Annual Meeting held in Denmark on September 2. Afterwards, he traveled all over Europe and the United States to investigate post-war production and recovery. Qian returned to Shanghai by plane from the United States the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he met with reporters at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Talking about his trip and feelings, he said: When I arrived in London, I met with John Boyd Orr, the director-general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Orr immediately urged our country's directors to set off early to attend the meeting. When I returned to Washington, I happened to be invited by the United Nations Agriculture Organization to hold a meeting of representatives from various countries to discuss the establishment of the World Food Bureau. The significance of the establishment of the bureau is that world food-producing countries can be divided into two types: surplus and insufficient. The former believes that although there is a general shortage of supply at present, world food may have a surplus trend in two or three years. At that time, food prices will fall and become competitive factors. With this organization, it can prevent catastrophic drops in food prices. At the same time, the bureau helps food-deficient countries to produce food and improve the nutritional level of their people. If there is a world food surplus, the bureau allocates funds to purchase and store grain, and when food prices rise, it sells the stored grain to suppress prices. This can stabilize food prices without the drawbacks of soaring and plummeting. Food-deficient countries can also receive continuous assistance without fear of famine. Its intention is good and appeals to many grain-producing countries. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina are not interested in this because they believe that the scope of the above organization is too broad and they would rather organize each grain individually because they believe it is more appropriate. For example, the World Wheat Conference was recently held in Washington. The method is for member countries to jointly agree on the highest and lowest market prices of world wheat in the next four years. Once the agreement is established, the purchase and sale of world wheat in these four years shall not exceed the range of the highest and lowest prices, so that exporting countries can obtain sales targets when wheat is surplus in the future, and food-deficient countries will not be short of food. And the organization of the association is simple and easy to achieve results. Therefore, the above-mentioned grain exporting countries and major grain importing countries attach more importance to this organization than the former, and even oppose the organization of the World Food greed. However, from the perspective of our country, we welcome the wheat conference and also place great hopes on the establishment of the World Food Bureau, because the establishment of the bureau will greatly help our country's entire agricultural construction.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Vice Minister Qian is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Jinjing at 1 pm today to report to the authorities.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Hospital Labor Strike: Hospital Director Issues Statement on Events; Work Stoppage Occurs; Dispute Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Sino-American Hospital, managed by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, was returned to Tongji University this autumn upon the personal order of Chairman Chiang. Subsequently, Tongji University and the Sino-American Hospital authorities held discussions and signed an agreement on November 28 to commence the takeover. As the takeover was underway, the hospital's workers presented five demands to the hospital administration and initiated a full-scale work slowdown on the 16th of this month. The hospital director, Shen Xianshu, held a press conference yesterday to report on the takeover process and the events of the recent work slowdown. The content of his statement is as follows: After Chairman Chiang personally ordered the return of the Sino-American Hospital to Tongji University, the hospital, previously managed by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, was converted into an affiliated hospital of Tongji University. However, at the inception of the Sino-American Hospital, the Sino-American Cooperative Organization invested a substantial amount of capital in renovations and remodeling. Therefore, after this takeover, all outstanding payments and bank overdrafts are to be the responsibility of Tongji University. The existing physicians at the hospital will have their contracts expire in June of next year. To facilitate clinical practice for students of Tongji University, the university intends to appoint professors and lecturers from the school as physicians at the hospital. The existing physicians will be given three months' salary as severance pay upon termination of their contracts. Furthermore, the takeover of a hospital is different from the takeover of ordinary institutions. Normal services must be maintained for patients in the hospital. Moreover, after this hospital reorganization, the hospital has lost its original independence, and all financial arrangements and personnel changes must be submitted to Tongji University for approval before implementation. It was at this juncture that the workers presented five demands to the hospital administration: (1) Adjust wages to provide a base salary of 32 yuan according to the cost of living index. (2) Guarantee workers' livelihoods and prevent unwarranted dismissals. (3) Provide winter uniforms. (4) Improve food and lodging. (5) Provide double pay at the end of the year. The hospital administration considered that the workers' demands had not been presented through proper channels and informed the workers that they should send official representatives to negotiate. The submitted demands could then be forwarded to Tongji University for approval or denial. After receiving this response, the workers did not send representatives but instead initiated a work slowdown on the 16th, shutting down the elevators, refusing to deliver meals to patients, and posting slogans on the walls and hospital vehicles. They also attempted to drive the vehicles out of the hospital. The hospital administration then locked the hospital gates, prohibiting entry and exit. During the work slowdown, the hospital received letters from thirteen hospitals, including Tongde, Nanyang, and Shanghai Epidemic Hospitals, urging that the workers' demands be approved so that the labor unrest could be resolved quickly to prevent similar incidents from affecting other hospitals. The hospital administration responded that since the Sino-American Hospital was now an affiliated hospital of Tongji University, everything had to await approval from Tongji University. Moreover, the workers' compensation at the hospital, totaling 120,000 yuan, including meals and lodging, was already generous compared to other hospitals. Compared to the employees of Tongji University, the difference was even greater. Therefore, the workers' demands would have to wait until the president of Tongji University returned to Shanghai before a decision could be made.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a request was made to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the labor unrest at the Sino-American Hospital has been ongoing for four days without resolution. After a brief work stoppage on the morning of the 16th, work resumed. However, the hospital administration has yet to respond to the four demands made by the 118 employees. On the morning of the 16th, the employees' union sent four representatives to see Director Shen to request a response, but the director refused to meet with them. Instead, the administrative director, Wu Songmao, conveyed a verbal response, stating that the first demand to raise the base salary to 32 yuan could not be met because Tongji University employees only received 66,000 yuan, while Sino-American Hospital employees already received 120,000 yuan. Regarding the second demand to improve food and lodging, the previous director, Ding Boxiong, had promised the employees to find a way to improve the situation this winter. However, due to the reorganization, the demand was resubmitted to the new director. The hospital administration's response was that there was not enough space, so the demand could not be met. Regarding the food, it might be possible to improve it through personal connections. Regarding the first demand to provide winter uniforms, it could not be done due to financial constraints. The fourth demand for job security could be met. At the time, all the employees felt that this was still unsatisfactory, so they briefly went on strike. However, after the police department sent personnel to explain that they should consider the patients, they resumed work and continued negotiations. Yesterday, the employees submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. As of last night, the issue remained unresolved. It is reported that this morning, representatives from all seventeen hospitals in the city have decided to petition the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<h3>Still Many Japanese Prisoners of War in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Not Only Cannot They All Be Sent Back Home, but a Batch Has Arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Our Report] As of recently, there are reportedly still over seven hundred Japanese prisoners of war housed at the Jiangwan National Defense Ministry's Prisoner of War Management Office. The office originally planned to complete their repatriation by the end of the year, but due to time-consuming investigations and a lack of ships, as well as continuous arrivals from various parts of the country, the original plan could not be completed. Yesterday, another 150 prisoners of war were escorted to Shanghai from Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Prisoner of War Management Office previously believed that many of the Japanese residents remaining in the city had no need to stay and some even changed their names with ulterior motives. Therefore, it began an investigation and discovered over thirty people who have already been repatriated. As for the Japanese residents currently remaining in Shanghai, it is reported that they all hold approved employment certificates from various agencies recognized by the Executive Yuan. Although many of them currently do not have work to do, the Prisoner of War Management Office is not in a position to repatriate them. As for the total number of Japanese residents, according to the household registration investigation by the security authorities, there are a total of 1,796 people, including 739 employed, 689 unemployed (family members, etc.), 73 unemployed, and 295 under the age of twelve.</p>
<p>[Further News] According to a responsible official of the municipal government, the repatriation of the second batch of German residents will be delayed until mid-February of next year.</p>
<h3>Defendant in Ohad Bureau Case Presents Letter from U.S. Ambassador as Evidence</h3>
<h3>Mueller Denies Engaging in Intelligence Work</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., the U.S. military court continued the trial of the Ohad Bureau case. The defense attorney for the defendant Heisch presented a letter from U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, to the Chinese authorities responsible for the repatriation of German residents. The letter stated that when he was serving as the president of Yenching University, he had hired Heisch as a library consultant and requested that he be exempted from repatriation. The defense attorney further stated that the Mongolian expert, Lattimore, had also entrusted Heisch to be his agent for purchasing Mongolian goods.</p>
<p>Another defendant being tried yesterday was Dr. Mueller, the 61-year-old head of the German news agency in Beiping. He denied that his news agency had any relationship with the Ohad Bureau and claimed that he had never engaged in any intelligence work before or after the German surrender. He dissolved his organization immediately after the German surrender and established another news agency, but all news released was subject to censorship by the then-puppet government.</p>
<h3>Former Police Officers of the Public Concession Request Prompt Payment of Pension</h3>
<h3>Xue Zhiliang and Others Report on Progress</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 4,615 former police officers of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the former Public Concession, regarding the matter of pension savings, have specifically submitted a request to the Liquidation Committee for Official Assets and Official Debt of the Former Public Concession of Shanghai and the French Concession, requesting prompt allocation of funds to maintain their livelihoods. They also elected representatives to host a press conference yesterday afternoon. Xue Zhiliang, the former assistant commissioner of the police department, reported on the progress, stating: The employees formerly serving in the police department of the Municipal Council were required by the council in 1931 to contribute 5% of their annual salary. Those who had served for 20 years or more would receive a retirement payment equivalent to one year's salary upon retirement. In 1942, the pension was changed to a savings plan, stipulating that those with a base salary of 35 or more would contribute 15% of their annual salary, with 10% contributed by the council and 5% deducted from their salary. Later, in view of the fluctuating economic situation, in order to safeguard the rights of the savings recipients, it was further stipulated that the amount would be calculated with an additional percentage, depending on the cost of living when the savings were paid out. When the Japanese invaded the concession, the customs were occupied, and the pension savings were ignored. By the time the British and Americans were detained in internment camps in February 1943, the accumulated savings totaled 5 million legal tender. With the victory of the Resistance War and the recovery of the concession, the employment relationship with the Municipal Council also ceased. Due to their difficult living conditions, these pension savings, accumulated from years of hard work, should be distributed. Therefore, colleagues in Shanghai and those reachable by mail from other cities were gathered, and a list of 4,615 names was compiled and sent to the Provisional Office of the former Municipal Council for verification and transfer to the relevant authorities for processing. It is estimated that there are about 500-600 other employees who have not registered. However, since the list was submitted, there has been no news. Until last month, it was learned that the Executive Yuan had established the Liquidation Committee for Official Assets and Official Debt of the Former Public Concession of Shanghai and the French Concession. A request was submitted to the committee to distribute the pension savings to the employees and to maintain the original regulations of the former Municipal Council, increasing the payment according to the rising cost of living.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Simplifies Land Transfer Registration Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, recognizing that land transactions in the city are frequent and that the time-consuming process of right-of-way transfer registration greatly affects land transactions and finance, has proposed a simplified procedure for land right-of-way transfer registration. For land right-of-way transfers, except in cases of doubt, dispute, or division/merger requiring measurement and mapping, a designated reviewer will verify the seal and signature and, if correct, instruct the applicant to pay the fee, issue a receipt, and return the original document with an endorsement and seal. This procedure can be completed within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the responsible person will fill out a form daily to notify the relevant units to complete other internal administrative procedures. The registration fee is only one-thousandth of the land value. This simplified procedure is even simpler than the deed transfer procedure during the concession era, and the fees are even lower.</p>
<h3>Relief for Impoverished People: Methods to Be Determined; Distribution of Goods to Be the Principle</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Winter Relief Committee, it has been actively carrying out various relief efforts. Currently, it has provided shelter for the destitute and homeless on the streets at the Tongzhou Road shelter. There are two other efforts currently underway: (1) relief for impoverished people, and (2) relief for the poor. The methods have already been drafted and will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the committee for decision tomorrow, after which they will be announced. According to reporter inquiries, the methods for relieving impoverished people are roughly as follows: (A) Scope of impoverished people: (1) families of soldiers in the Anti-Japanese War and families of martyred comrades, (2) families with five or more members and no fixed income, and (3) widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless with young children are all eligible to apply for relief. (B) Relief measures: According to their impoverished condition, they will be divided into three categories: A, B, and C. The principle is to distribute goods. Category A will receive goods worth 150,000 yuan, Category B will receive goods worth 100,000 yuan, and Category C will receive goods worth 50,000 yuan, consisting of flour, white rice, or soybean powder. (C) Application procedure: To benefit those receiving relief, the procedure will be extremely simple. Applicants only need to fill out an application form and have it certified by the local baojia head, then submit it to the Winter Relief Committee. The committee will then forward it to the district office for review before issuing the relief goods. Regarding the relief for the poor, it will be carried out in five districts: Xujiahui, Caojiadu, Hongkou, and Zhabei. The principle is also to distribute goods. It is reported that each person will receive one or one and a half catties of flour per day. The distribution procedure will involve preliminary investigations, followed by entrusting private charitable organizations to handle the distribution.</p>
<h3>Director of Jiangsu Provincial Information Office, Zhang Yulin, Discusses Recent Situation</h3>
<p>Zhang Yulin, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Information Office, came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. When reporters inquired about the recent political situation in Jiangsu Province, he said that among the 63 counties and cities in the province, with the exception of a very small number of counties in northern Jiangsu that are still awaiting recovery, the general situation has improved significantly. The provincial government, following the instructions of the central government, has set up the Chairman's Office in Huaiyin, with Wang Gongyu, the director of civil affairs, as the director, to handle all emergency matters in the recovered areas. Chairman Wang Maogong will be stationed in Huaiyin and will travel to the recovered counties for inspection to appease refugees and stabilize the people's hearts. In the future, the province will focus its efforts on northern Jiangsu while not neglecting southern Jiangsu. Currently, it is focusing on "restoring order and establishing security," using politics in conjunction with military affairs to actively carry out pacification work. Appropriate measures have been established for the facilities of education, the organization of land administration, and the promotion of health administration in northern Jiangsu, which will be implemented in order. The military and civilian highways throughout the province are also being actively expanded. The collection of land taxes in kind is going well. The county magistrate examination is scheduled to be held on the 20th, and there are many enthusiastic candidates. Chairman Wang has recently transferred from Huaiyin to Beijing to personally preside over the examination. As for the local security situation, it is much better than in the past, but the most difficult problem is the imbalance between revenue and expenditure in finance. The provincial and county local budgets are being actively compiled. In general, the politics of Jiangsu Province is gradually getting on the right track.</p>

<h3>Protecting Domestic Cement Industry to Prevent Dumping of Foreign Goods: Ministry of Economic Affairs Has Taken Effective Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's cement industry was forcibly occupied and destroyed by the enemy, resulting in severe losses. After the victory, due to factors such as lack of capital, high costs, transportation difficulties, and dumping of foreign goods, production and sales fell into difficulties. A month ago, the China Cement Industry Federation repeatedly appealed to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and other agencies for relief. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, after investigating the details, has taken effective measures to protect the domestic cement industry. The detailed methods are as follows: (1) Requesting the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all agencies to use domestic cement for all construction needs and to prohibit the purchase of foreign goods. (2) Consulting the Ministry of Transportation to provide special assistance and improvements for the transportation and sales of domestic cement. (3) For situations such as worker absenteeism, strikes, and interference with factory management rights, the competent authorities will strictly prohibit them. Workers' base salaries shall not be arbitrarily increased without the approval of the competent authority. (4) In order to prevent the dumping of foreign goods, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the National Tariff Commission to consider increasing and modifying the import tariff rate for cement. (5) The Coal Committee will continue to allocate the coal needed by the cement industry at the original price to reduce costs. (6) The loans needed by the cement industry can be applied for from the nearest branch of the Four Banks Joint Office in accordance with the revised investment and loan guidelines of the Joint Treasury.</p>
<p>Import of Foreign Goods · Request for Prohibition</p>
<p>If these measures can be effectively implemented, the situation of the cement industry will naturally be greatly improved. However, because the industry believes that the dumping of foreign goods is the most serious problem, it has further applied to the Temporary Import Management Committee to prohibit the import of foreign cement, because the quality of domestic cement has always been no less than that of foreign goods, and it is estimated that the current production capacity of cement factories across the country can reach more than 21 million barrels per year, which is more than enough to meet all domestic needs. In addition, the Goods Tax Bureau stipulates that a tax stamp must be affixed to each bag of cement sold domestically, which is difficult to implement. The industry association has repeatedly telegraphed the Tax Administration to request exemption from stamping, and it is now learned that the legislative bill has been passed.</p>
<p>Cement Factories · Ordering New Machines</p>
<p>According to the current situation, except for the Shanghai Cement Company, which has concentrated on suspension of work, the remaining Qixin Yanghui Company, China Cement Company, Huaxin Cement Company, North China Cement Company, Xicun Cement Factory, Taiyuan Cement Factory, Sichuan Cement Company, and the Taiwan Cement Company established by the Resources Committee after taking over enemy property, as well as the cement factories in the nine northeastern provinces, are all actively seeking development. Huaxin Cement Factory plans to order the latest machinery with 60 billion yuan of national currency, and the Jiangnan Cement Company in Nanjing also plans to order the latest machinery with US$1.62 million.</p>
<p>It is also learned that in recent months, the selling price of domestic cement has also increased slightly due to increased costs. As for American cement, imports have been less due to the seamen's strike, but 310,000 bags have been shipped after the labor dispute was resolved and have now arrived outside Wusongkou and will soon be imported.</p>
<h3>Sales Department No. 3 of Public and Education Personnel Distribution Office Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Blankets at 45,500 yuan</p>
<p>In order to improve the distribution business and facilitate the purchase of goods by public and education personnel, the Shanghai Public and Education Personnel Goods Distribution Office has specially established the No. 1 Sales Department at No. 200 Fuzhou Road, specializing in the sale of various daily necessities supplied by the Materials Supply Bureau. The No. 2 Sales Department is located at No. 355 Zha Pu Road, and the No. 3 Sales Department is located at No. 1-10 Jiangxi Road in the Duchen Hotel, selling general retail daily necessities. All are scheduled to open for business tomorrow. According to the person in charge of the office: public and education personnel who hold a purchase permit must first go to each sales department with the purchase permit to obtain a sales department distribution registration form for transactions. As for blankets, the No. 1 Sales Department will directly distribute them. Public and education personnel can bring the purchase permit and the "Zhou" character purchase ticket (the number must be filled in and the seal affixed on the back of the ticket) to purchase. The price is set at 45,500 yuan per piece, and they will be sold in order until they are sold out.</p>
<h3>Private Farms Can Apply for Low-Interest Loans After Registration</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Wei Yuxu, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters: The Social Affairs Bureau previously announced a deadline for the registration of private farms in the city. Later, because the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry revised the previously promulgated Farm Registration Regulations, the Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the order, drafted a Farm Registration Instructions and printed all the forms separately. It is stipulated that from New Year's Day to the end of January next year, it will be the registration period for established private farms, and no supplementary registrations will be accepted after this period. For private farms themselves, there are two major benefits after registration: (1) They can apply for low-interest loans from the China Farmers Bank, with an interest rate of only 4%, and the time limit depends on the nature of the farm. (2) They can obtain technical guidance and material assistance from the government. For example, the Social Affairs Bureau has been allocated American vegetable seeds, but because the farms are not registered, they cannot be distributed. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been allocated American insecticide equipment, which is of great benefit to the prevention of insect pests on farms. Currently, operating a farm is quite profitable. For example, planting vegetables, cultivating flowers, and raising livestock are all profitable. However, there are also two prerequisites: one is that whether you are planting flowers or raising chickens, you must choose good varieties, as there is not much demand for ordinary ones. The second is that the operation of the farm must be based on modern management, and this is also a prerequisite for borrowing from the China Farmers Bank.</p>

He was tried at the High Court yesterday morning. After questioning, the court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Wang Jinfa, who was accused of keeping the enemy's East Asia Automobile Company's property, was previously sentenced to three years in prison. The defendant refused to accept the sentence and applied for a retrial. The Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. Yesterday afternoon, Zhou Anbang, the accuser, was first summoned to testify at the High Court, followed by the defendant, who claimed that the plaintiff, Zhou Anbang, had another Victory Automobile Company that was not doing well and that he was falsely accused out of jealousy. Later, Gu Sanbao, a plainclothes policeman from the police station, testified that the shops in Pudong had jointly guaranteed Wang Jinfa, and that Wang was indeed a nominal secret agent. Finally, Mr. Weng, who had worked underground in a military organization, testified that Wang Jinfa had used his car to transport firearms and radio equipment for the organization. The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the retrial. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation on Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Headache and Nasal Congestion</p>
<p>Yin Wenqu asks: I am 43 years old this year. Five or six years ago, I had headaches and tinnitus. After asking a major hospital for an examination, the doctor said that the disease was in my nose and asked for a blood test, but because of limited finances, I did not proceed. Unexpectedly, in the first month of this year, I suddenly felt a hard nucleus growing on the right side of my neck. At first, I ignored it, but as time went on, the nucleus gradually increased in size, and another nucleus grew on the left side. The nasal congestion worsened, the headache was unbearable, and my body became weaker day by day. I don't know what the disease is. How should I treat it?</p>

Please ask: (1) Is this injection effective for long-term injection? (2) This injection has a strong reaction (such as high fever, etc.). Can I replace it with other special injections? (3) Can this disease be cured by injections without surgery? (Supplemented by long-term rest) (4) What are the consequences of removing the right kidney?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) The effect of injecting (Yatoconin) is uncertain. (2) There is no special medicine. (3) It is better to perform a nephrectomy. Injections are unlikely to be effective. (4) Removing one kidney is not a big problem.</p>

<h3>Banks Close Accounts Today; Gold Prices Still Expected to Rise; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Were Driven Up Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still hopes for a holiday, and the spot price rebounded after falling. It opened at 3.335 million in the morning and gradually stabilized from 3.315 million. Once it caused a sensation, it soon rose back to 3.39 million before there was pressure. The Central Bank allocated Article 38 at a price of 3.37 million. Around 10 o'clock, it hovered around 3.37 million. Later, speculative funds from the securities sector came to hype it up again. The supply of funds temporarily stopped, and it broke through 3.4 million, rising again to 3.43 million before it hovered under the supply of the Central Bank.

<h3>Large Investors Took the Opportunity to Sell; China Stocks Wanted to Rise But Stopped</h3>
<p>China stocks wanted to rise again yesterday, but stopped. When the high price of American Asia reached the daily limit, large investors took the opportunity to sell, so the market on the table suddenly loosened, and the market situation was doubled in confusion.

Guangbang sold high and returned. No. 197, No. 76, No. 133, No. 89, and No. 36 all sold, and it became lower and lower. There were many ups and downs in the middle, but the thin code was loose, and it was easy to fall and difficult to rise. No. 76, No. 198, No. 106, and No. 36 repeatedly sold out. At noon, it became tired again, but the asking price rose after closing. As a result, Deyong Yarn, Xinnuo, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Huafeng all fell, Qin Xing and American Asia rose slightly, and the cold stock matches fell by 10%. The rest rose and fell differently. The interbank Deyong Yarn, Xinnuo, and Xinguang Huafeng fell slightly, and American Asia rose slightly.

No. 198, No. 38, No. 89, and No. 177 sold from time to time, and No. 89 and No. 162 even sold Deyong Yarn on the spot. After struggling until 3 o'clock, it began to feel sluggish and once fell back to the closing price at noon.

Ordinary silk also rose accordingly. The dry warp market was still stable yesterday, staying at the original level. The rayon market fell yesterday because there was more supply than demand in the market.

Recently, most legislators have attended the National Assembly, so it must wait until after the National Assembly is closed before it can continue to be discussed. The date of announcement will be in the spring.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Weak Externally and Strong Internally</h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, Chen Qimen's market continued to be quiet, but Ping Shui's top-grade Chen Zhucha was in great demand by export firms, especially Wu Chang Tea Company, which did not refuse anyone. Unfortunately, the inventory in the market was very scarce, so the selling price was extremely firm. It is also learned that Wang Yutai Tea Company is also searching for fried green tea to reproduce export tea.</p>
<h3>Sales Tax on Native Cloth Exempted from Next Year</h3>
<p>In order to encourage the production of native cloth, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that from January 36, the sales tax on native cloth will be exempted, except for sales merchants. It is heard that the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Direct Tax Bureau have received the above order. The tax-free standards for native cloth are as follows: (1) Limited to manufacturing industries woven by manual hand-operated machines, drawing machines, or foot-operated machines. (2) Limited to hand-woven cloth and twill cloth. Cloth woven with stripes and plaids are included. (3) Mainly woven with native yarn, but if machine yarn is used, the single yarn shall not exceed 16 counts. (4) Not limited to length and width. (5) Not limited to plain color and dyed color.</p>
<h3>Only Retail Sales of Woolen Cloth</h3>
<p>Recently, the woolen cloth market has been suffering from high interest rates. Customers and ports have continued to close down and account for facts. In addition, the end of the lunar year is approaching in the blink of an eye. Both buyers and sellers have become wary. At the same time, imported goods are arriving in Shanghai one after another, and people's hearts are therefore tired. All standards have always been flat and tired. There are only sporadic sales in the market and general wholesale houses. Except for American Melton goods, there are very few original boxes of whole pieces of business.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau and Brunner Mond Are in Negotiations to Stabilize the Market Price of Caustic Soda</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Steer, the business manager of Brunner Mond, went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to discuss the issue of selling off stored alkali and stabilizing market prices with Section Chief Zhao of the Economic Administration Department. Regarding the various inquiries from the Social Affairs Bureau, the company plans to submit a formal written reply next Monday. According to the British side's opinion, Brunner Mond does not occupy a pivotal position in the supply of caustic soda in this city. According to the statistics it has collected, within this year, Brunner Mond imported 3,500 tons, Hong Kong imported 1,196 tons, the Philippines shipped 1,518 tons, and the United States shipped 3,688 tons. Therefore, Brunner Mond's supply only accounts for slightly more than one-third. As for the trend of chemical raw material prices, relevant people pointed out that the current market price fluctuations are due to insufficient supply, and the various restrictions on import trade are also related to this. For example, a batch of chemical raw materials arrived at the port nearly a month ago, but because the application for import has not been approved, it has not been able to be declared and unloaded. However, the increase in the price of chemical raw materials has its own limit, otherwise substitutes will be forced to be used. For example, in terms of caustic soda, pure alkali can replace it.</p>
<h3>Sharp Rise in Red Alum and Sodium Silicate</h3>
<p>Although the United States previously banned the export of red alum, the inventory in this city is very thick, so the price has not fluctuated for half a year. Now that the stocks of potassium red alum and sodium red alum have become thin, and red alum is an indispensable main raw material for manufacturing aniline oil, and aniline oil has not been imported for a long time, it is currently relying entirely on domestic products for supply. In addition, dyeing factories have been searching for it recently, so red alum is extraordinarily popular, and the prices of potassium red alum and sodium red alum have also risen accordingly. The price of potassium red alum has risen from 2,400 yuan per pound to 4,700 yuan, and the price of sodium red alum has risen from 800 yuan per pound to 4,200 yuan. In addition, sodium silicate (also known as sodium silicate) has been strongly sought after by soap factories recently, and the price per pound has risen from 140 yuan to 350 yuan. There is no stock available. It is found that sodium silicate is manufactured by Dahua and other factories in this city. In the past, due to the import of American goods, the quality was good and the price was low, and the price could not maintain the cost. (It is found that the cost of domestic sodium silicate is 450 yuan per pound, while American goods are only 150 yuan), it has long been discontinued, and the stock of American goods has been emptied. Various parties are making great efforts to purchase it, so the rising trend is very unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Sharp Rise in Foreign Pine</h3>
<p>In the timber market, foreign pine rose because Fangzi had a lot of actual sales and the inventory was also thin. When gold banknotes rose, it took advantage of the opportunity, and the market price has exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark. The prices of other timbers are also firm.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Initially Rises, Then Falls Back; Oil Cakes and Coarse Grains Show Strength</h3>
<p>Over 9,000 stones of rice arrived from both the north and south, with brisk sales in the morning market. However, activity slowed down in the afternoon, resulting in an initial rise followed by a pullback. Consequently, both northern and southern japonica rice saw prices increase by 1,000 yuan per shi (unit of measure). White rice for congee (thin rice porridge) was selling well, continuing to rise by 2,000 yuan. Indica rice remained stable. Wheat flour saw sluggish sales for clear stock but acceptable demand for bean products, and prices remained firm, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. Bran also increased by 100 yuan. Soybeans continued to trend flat and weak, with sluggish sales in other areas and little interest from oil mills. Green beans from Southeast Asia were scarce, keeping the market firm. Black-eyed peas for oil extraction continued to advance, rising another 1,000 yuan. High-quality red beans were in demand on the local market, rising slightly by 300 to 400 yuan, while medium and lower grades remained flat. Corn from Qingdao continued to be in demand, with arrivals failing to keep pace with sales, pushing prices gradually higher, adding another 1,000+ yuan. Soybean cakes for Southeast Asia were fully booked, resulting in a market slowdown, pulling prices back down by 100 yuan. Wheat supplies were running low, resulting in a brisk market, pushing prices up by 1,000 yuan. The oil market saw improved sales, with raw oil rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean oil also increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame oil saw some gains. However, factories were eager to sell off refined oil, pulling prices back down by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Plummets as Bundled Goods are Sold at a Loss</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market plummeted. Due to sluggish inland sales and weak prices, buyers were largely inactive. Furthermore, the Yarn Control Committee's allocation of yarn to replica factories and retailers was being sold off at discounted prices in large quantities on the market, resulting in an oversupply of goods and weak sentiment. 20-count Shuang Ma brand (Double Horse Brand) cotton bales were priced at only 2 million yuan, while Jin Cheng brand was only 2.04 to 2.05 million yuan, down 50,000 to 100,000 yuan from the previous day. The previously scarce 42-count, two-ply Qian (Money) brand was also being sold off privately by weaving factories that had received allocations, resulting in lower prices, with the already limited supply dropping by over 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Control Committee Exchanges Ideas; New Plan Not Yet Finalized</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee convened a regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room, adjourning at approximately 6:00 PM. During the meeting, members exchanged detailed views on the six-point plan for handling cotton yarn provided by the government (the three most important points were published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper). According to Wu Guozhen, the concurrently serving Chairman, after the meeting, no definitive conclusions were reached. While some points of agreement were reached in principle, technical details and specifics still need to be studied. The final decision will be submitted to President Song for approval before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the government's proposed six-point plan was the result of extensive discussions and consultations between President Song and relevant parties, gathering diverse opinions. The six-point plan is said to be a compromise from President Song's initial proposal.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices remained firm due to optimistic sentiment and increased buying. Despite the company's auction period, the rising trend did not weaken. However, the auction price remained unchanged. The guild's spot price for medium-grade white sugar was 147,000 yuan, up over 2,000 yuan. Raw sugar was at 127,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Guang Bang's Runde Qing also rebounded by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, to a high of 97,000 to 98,000 yuan, with the final price being 94,000 to 96,000 yuan. Thin-sliced Qing was at 85,000 to 86,000 yuan, with over a thousand transactions. Xinghua Bang's Kai Gong powdered white sugar was at 148,000 to 155,000 yuan, with the ordinary grade at 137,000 to 138,000 yuan, with an increase of nearly 10,000 yuan. Ming Jing red sugar was at 145,000 to 142,000 to 143,000 yuan, with 140,000 yuan, with over two thousand basket transactions. Diao Qing was sporadically offered at 100,500 yuan, up 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Foreign Paper Prices</h3>
<p>Foreign paper prices have risen sharply in the past week, with an average increase of over 30%. Transparent paper, in particular, has nearly doubled in price. This is due to strong demand from cigarette factories. This type of paper is considered a luxury item, and imports are difficult, making the price increase seem unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Import/Export Business Group Studies Allocation of Import Goods</h3>
<p>The city's Import and Export Business Association has divided into forty subgroups to discuss issues such as import quotas. These subgroups have been conducting individual studies since the beginning of this week, meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association at 3:00 PM each afternoon. It is reported that these subgroup meetings will take a month to complete. The plan is to submit a written report on all the difficult issues arising from each meeting to the Import/Export Control Committee for assistance.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Remain High</h3>
<p>Coal market prices for various types of bituminous coal remain high, but supplies are slow to move. Lump coal from Jiaozuo is selling well, and market sentiment is firm. Raw materials for coal briquettes have arrived, and factories will receive their allocations. Market conditions are expected to ease, but previous market trends do not support price reductions. Firewood and charcoal are also priced high, resulting in sluggish sales for shops. Market prices are said to be high.</p>
<h3>List of Approved Import Merchants to be Released Next Week</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Import/Export Control Committee, over 3,500 applications from import businesses have been received. The approval and release of the list could have occurred sooner, but many applicants failed to fill out the application forms according to the required format, causing delays. The full list is expected to be released next week. It is also reported that there are no restrictions on import applications. Both established and newly formed businesses can apply, but the scope of the application must comply with regulations.</p>
<h3>Soap, Candles, and Matches Reach Unprecedented High Prices</h3>
<p>Due to a shortage of raw materials for the manufacturing of soap, candles, and matches, production has declined sharply. Manufacturers have limited supplies for sale, and consumers are forced to search for goods on the market. This imbalance between supply and demand, coupled with hoarding, has caused market prices to surge. Yesterday, all grades of soap reached unprecedented high prices. Gu Ben soap increased by 11,000 yuan, Arrow Knife soap increased by 8,000 yuan, and Beautiful matches soared by 100,000 yuan, reaching a peak of 730,000 yuan. Candles also generally increased in price.</p>

<h3>Bank of Japan to Aid Textile Industry Recovery</h3>

The bank is currently aiding the industry's current production levels. If the Allied Occupation authorities permit, the bank also intends to allocate funds to restore it to its original state. According to Japanese news reports, the Japanese government has requested the Allied Headquarters to allocate 50,000 bales of cotton yarn spun from imported American cotton for domestic use in the final quarter of this year. One-fifth of the requested amount is to be allocated for the production of fishing nets.</p>

If debtors abscond, legal action will be initiated by the judicial authorities.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Selling National Goods to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Trade between China and Southeast Asia has made no progress in recent months. From the perspective of exports, the biggest problem is the high cost of national goods and the low purchasing power in the local market. As a result, many exporters have returned empty-handed. At the same time, the lack of transportation further hinders the sale of national goods to Southeast Asia. From the perspective of imports, there were previously many imports of rubber, coconut oil, and other goods. However, since the announcement of the import permit system, the situation has changed significantly. Among Southeast Asian imports, most of the items listed in the import goods list are in the second or third grade. Applying for import permits is time-consuming, and the volume of imports has been significantly affected. The fundamental solution is to improve production efficiency to reduce the cost of national goods. The short-term solution is to simplify procedures to facilitate imports. In addition, seeking the assistance of overseas Chinese is also a matter of urgency.</p>
<h3>Scarce Steel Rebar Commands High Prices</h3>

Once the application for permits is completed, the goods can be retrieved, and prices are expected to stabilize.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Global Sports Association football team and the Fudan University football team held a friendly match at the Fudan Field at 3:30 PM yesterday. The referee was Wang Nanzhen, and the linesmen were Chen Jingchu and Chu Jianhong. Fudan team captain Qian Changrong was absent. Wang Hesheng was moved forward, leaving a gap in the rear defense. In addition, the biting cold wind made the attack and defense less intense. The result was a 2-2 draw with Global.</p>
<p>Match Report</p>
<p>The course of the match was as follows: At the sound of the whistle, the competition began. Fudan launched frequent attacks. In the third minute, center forward Wang Dingqiu (who is a currently serving air force member), a veteran of the air force, broke through the Global defense line with the ball and shot fiercely. The ball grazed the post and bounced back. Fan Sijie caught up and scored, opening the scoring. Global center forward Wang Fushan was enraged and equalized the score. The first half ended 1-1.</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, Fudan's Wang Hesheng was transferred to the left inner wing, making the rear defense even more vulnerable. Global's Wang Yishan took advantage of this and scored a goal, putting Global in the lead 2-1. Seeing the situation worsen, Fudan intensified its attack. However, Global defender Zhu Chengfu defended very strictly, repeatedly turning danger into safety. In the 71st minute, Wang Hesheng sent a high ball, Wang Dingqiu passed left, and Fan Sijie took the opportunity to score again. The two sides then entered a chaotic battle, with no further goals scored. The final score was 2-2. The lineups of the two sides were as follows:</p>

<p>The Final Group Tonight</p>
<p>Still Held in the Original Location</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The final group of the Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Individual Championship will be held tonight at 7:00 PM. Due to the small size of the Jingwu Association Hall on the third floor of Cishu Building, it was decided to change the venue to the third floor of the Quanggong Bank. However, due to other uses of that location, it has been decided to hold it in the original location. The list of players in this group is as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Kaiyun, Feng Hao, Chen Zengliang, Jiang Baiquan, Wang Zongze, Zhu Kuangchen.</p>
<h3>Second Basketball League: Registration Deadline This Weekend</h3>

<h3>The Ching Pak Team's Final Battle in Hong Kong: Football Team Wins, Basketball Team Loses</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] On the 16th, the Ching Pak football team defeated the Hong Kong All-Stars team by one goal, completing their tour in Hong Kong. Ching Pak's victory was truly a stroke of luck. After half a month of matches in Hong Kong, this last game found the Ching Pak players exhausted. Some had already left, and others were injured, almost leading to a weakened team. In the end, they brought in the veteran Fuchs from the St. Francis team, who reluctantly played. Fortunately, the defense line remained strong, and Qin Biga seemed increasingly energetic, ultimately defeating the Hong Kong All-Stars.</p>
<p>Sparse Crowd on Jia Mountain</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Chinese fans, seeing that Ching Pak's skills were "nothing more than this," were not as enthusiastic as before. Yesterday, Jia Mountain was noticeably deserted. The Ching Pak team will take a car to the province this morning, preparing for two matches, one against the city police and one against the Strong China team. They plan to return to Hong Kong in 20 days, at which time there may be another Shanghai All-Stars vs. Hong Kong All-Stars match. However, due to the reduced interest of fans, it is still difficult to predict whether that game will actually take place.</p>
<p>Basketball Spectators are Sick of It</p>
<p>In basketball, Ching Pak was defeated by the Hong Kong All-Stars. On the 15th, the Hong Kong All-Stars beat Ching Pak 32-23. On the day Ching Pak barely defeated the Zhili, the basketball champion of Hong Kong and China, by one point, experienced spectators predicted Ching Pak would face an inevitable final misfortune. Looking at these nine Hong Kong-Shanghai football and basketball matches, we cannot help but lament the lack of sporting talent in our country. It's always the same players playing, and even the audience is sick of watching. The sporting value is even more questionable. Therefore, our post-war sports plan urgently needs to overthrow the "hero worship" of the past and start with the universal cultivation of new talents.</p>
<p>The lineup for the Ching Pak vs. Hong Kong All-Stars match was as follows:</p>
<p>Ching Pak Team</p>
<p>Qin Biga, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Zhai Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Cao Qiuting, Zhang Jinhai, Song Lingsheng, Fuchs</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chinese All-Stars</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng, Li Guowei, Huo Yaohua, Luo Quan, Liang Rongzhao, Kong Qingyu, Li Shuoyou, Zou Wenzhi, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, He Yingfen</p>
<p>Victory by One Goal; Defeating Hong Kong All-Stars</p>
<p>After playing for half the game, neither side had scored. The Hong Kong All-Stars forwards were active, frequently attacking Ching Pak. Ching Pak played cautiously and defended against the strong opponents. Qin Biga delivered an excellent performance at this time. Zou Wenzhi, Li Shuoyou, and He Yingfen made multiple fierce shots, all saved by his skillful hands.</p>
<p>In the second half, Ching Pak gained an advantage. In the forward line, Zhang Jinhai's rushes, Song Lingsheng's flair, Luo Shoufu's running across the field, and Cao Qiuting's quick runs and passes each had their unique strengths. So, less than seven minutes into the second half, Luo Shoufu got a goal, facing the goalkeeper alone. The All-Stars goalkeeper left the goal, and the ball went into the net. This goal was truly due to a misunderstanding between Huo Yaohua and Zhu Zhaoheng. Ching Pak won by such a lucky chance, which shows that it was not an extraordinary success in terms of skill. If Ching Pak becomes complacent because of this victory, the status of our national football team in the international arena may decline even further!</p>

<p>Winter Special Issue</p>
<h3>Talking About the Christmas Eve of Revelry</h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper's Research Department</p>
<p>Ten years ago, dance halls looked forward to Christmas with great anticipation. Because the usually slow business could be guaranteed to be full on that day. Therefore, the original dance halls were all decorated. The roofs were hung with cotton snow, with a bunch of balloons tied in the middle. The band's backdrop was nailed with the words "Merry Christmas." In addition, the dance hall owners also prepared bags of toys, paper hats, whistles, dolls… symbolizing Santa Claus bringing a large bag of gifts in the snowy weather, sliding down the chimney, and distributing them to those who are kind.</p>
<p>We also cannot forget the Christmas feast in the dance halls, the excellent turkey, the fragrant champagne… The dancers also prepared new outfits to repay the kindness of the foreign bosses and reserved Christmas feasts in the dance halls.</p>
<p>That night, the dance halls borrowed many tables and chairs from fellow hometown associations to accommodate the rare crowded dance guests of the year. Although the tables and chairs were full, the tide of people, those gentlemen and ladies in formal wear, often shrugged their shoulders, indicating that they could not get a seat.</p>
<p>Look! This situation is unimaginable for beggars shivering outside in the northerly wind, unable to receive gifts from Santa Claus. The radiators were turned on hotter than the sun, and the smoke filled the air like steam. The waiters used their experience to pop open the champagne. The gentlemen and foreign bosses drank with the same wild abandon as shown in American movies. The musicians received rewards and played with extra vigor in their formal wear. But the chaotic sounds of whistles from all directions ruined the jazz. Not a single dancer was left in the seats. The young and old were all swept away. In this way, a small piece of the dance floor was packed like an ant colony in the African forest, making it impossible to see the whole, only the shifting sands wriggling there.</p>
<p>In order to boast to friends the next day, those who had drunk too much foreign wine hired cars and went to the second, third… dance halls to play. In this way, they played until dawn before lying across the carriages and humming foreign songs on their way back.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the foreigners in Shanghai were driven into enemy detention camps. The compradors changed their professions to hoarding and speculation. Clerks also lowered their status and ran small errands. As a result, the very foreign Christmas became very deserted. The first set of formal wear was torn, and there was no strength to make a second set. Although the dance halls had Christmas feasts, people were not interested in turkey. Patrons wearing silk padded robes stepped into dance halls where the radiators had been removed by the Japanese, only occupying a corner and replacing champagne with clear tea. After all, the Japanese's big leather shoes were far inferior to the bright, pointy, thin-skinned patent leather shoes. Draft beer filled the Japanese up, and they staggered around the dance halls. How could they form a whole block of people again?</p>
<p>However, students at missionary schools could not forget this Western interest. They often gathered in groups of three or five to hold Christmas "parties" in their homes. Talcum powder was rubbed on the small living room floor, red and green light bulbs were strung on the Christmas tree, and a record player was turned on, with the help of the radio. They could still dance very excitedly.</p>
<p>Now, it is the second Christmas after the victory and is fast approaching. The foreign bosses have been out of the concentration camps for a long time, and with the addition of a large number of American soldiers, the grand occasion of Christmas Eve will surely be revived.</p>
<p>Yes, each dance hall is planning: menus, programs, gifts… preparing a night of revelry for the customers!</p>
<p>However, the grandeur of ten years ago cannot be revived immediately. The import firms that depended on foreigners for food have suffered great losses, and all industries are in a state of decline. Who would be in the mood to make formal wear and attend the turkey feast?</p>
<h3>Christmas Tales of Wonder</h3>
<p>Heavy Snowfall on the Day - Great Harvest Next Year for Sure</p>
<p>Strong Wind at Dawn - All Livestock Suffer</p>
<p>Bright Lights at Night - Can Eliminate Disaster</p>
<p>Cricket on the Stove - Everyone is Overjoyed</p>
<p>All countries in the world cannot avoid superstitious actions, and Westerners are even more superstitious about Christmas events in a "variety of ways."</p>
<p>This year's Christmas is on Wednesday—eek! Christmas falling on a Wednesday is said to be very ominous! According to their saying, this year will be very cold, and there will be hurricanes, wars will happen next year, epidemics will run rampant everywhere, volcanoes will erupt, and natural and man-made disasters will be everywhere, and… hey hey! Do you believe it or not?</p>
<p>The weather on Christmas Day is said to be related to good or bad fortune for the coming year, just as our people say that if it rains on the first day of the Lunar New Year, it is unlucky to go out this year. Their saying is this: If the moon is bright and the stars are sparse on Christmas Eve, that's great. There will definitely be a great harvest of melons and fruits next year, and the price will be cheap. If the sky is covered with dark clouds, or there is a downpour, that's terrible. You won't be able to eat melons and fruits or drink wine. It is best to have heavy snowfall on Christmas Day, and next year will definitely be a bumper year. If the sky is gloomy during the day, the wheat will be abundant next year, otherwise, the harvest will definitely be poor. If you can get a lot of milk at night, the production of chickens and ducks will definitely be high tomorrow. If there is a strong wind at dawn, chickens, ducks, cattle, pigs, and all livestock may suffer. If there is thunder and lightning on Christmas Day, the weather will be extremely cold, but next year, the industrial and commercial sectors will be very profitable. If the sunlight is warm from morning to evening, then next year will be stable and uneventful. However, if there are dark clouds obscuring the sun at sunset, epidemics will spread in the spring and summer of next year. If there is also a gust of wind, the population will definitely die in heaps next year, which is unimaginable!</p>
<p>A Westerner's home is always filled with joy and excitement on Christmas Eve, thoroughly lively. All the lights, candles, and electric lights are lit, because in their view, light can eliminate great disasters. Some families hang a multi-sectioned wooden stick on the wall and burn it with fire, then the whole family sits and "chants words" of blessings. Everyone hopes that this wooden stick can be burned completely, then all events next year, large and small, will definitely be satisfactory.</p>
<p>What's disappointing on Christmas Eve is that many demons and ghosts also come to visit on this evening, the most common of which is the "suicide ghost," taking advantage of this time to seek "hosts." "They" often spread the seeds of sin in the human world before twelve o'clock. However, it is best to simply open the windows completely before twelve o'clock to show "welcome," then perhaps you will be forgiven by "them." What is most taboo is: if you keep the windows tightly closed, those demons and ghosts will come looking for trouble.</p>
<p>The first thing that enters the door on Christmas Day is best to be green, and the first person to enter the door is best to be a man, because it is said that a man entering the door first can bring happiness. Even cats, dogs, and other livestock, it is best for the male to enter the door first.</p>
<p>The most popular animals at Christmas are crickets and roosters. Because Westerners believe that crickets carry the most seeds of happiness. If a cricket jumps on the stove, the whole family will be overjoyed. If the rooster can crow all night on Christmas Eve, it foretells a bumper harvest next year.</p>
<p>If a young lady hopes that her fiancé will meet her in a dream on Christmas Eve, she only needs to eat a few black chicken eggs before going to bed. If she is afraid that the dream will be short and the feeling long, and that the rice is exhausted, then first cook the eggs thoroughly, remove the yolks, mix them with sugar, and eat them. If this trick is not effective at all, and you don't have a single dream? Then you deserve it!</p>
<p>There are many more myths and legends! The holly used for interior decoration should not be too smooth. If it is too smooth, there will be unfortunate events next year. It also cannot be too rough. If it is too rough, the relationship between husband and wife will become bad. When preparing sacrificial items, a woman must not break the fruit bread when baking it, otherwise, this woman will not live to see next year's Christmas. Leather items cannot be brought into the door on Christmas Day, because leather will bring in the seeds of misfortune. When burning charcoal, barefoot or blind people must not enter the door, especially women with fat insteps. It is best to keep the charcoal fire in the stove at night properly, so that Mr. Zhurong (the god of fire) will not visit you throughout the next year.</p>
<p>There are too many to remember. If you are interested, you may want to ask the Westerners living in China if they have any of the above actions?</p>

<h3>The Winter Solstice is as Big as the New Year</h3>
<p>Foreign customs on Christmas are similar in principle to Chinese rituals on the Winter Solstice.</p>
<p>Chinese people always like to call Christmas the "Foreign Winter Solstice," because foreign customs on Christmas are completely similar in principle to the customs of our country on the Winter Solstice Festival. Why do we say that? Because both follow the ancestral myths and rituals, and contain the ancient folk festive entertainment!</p>
<p>Writing about Christmas is certainly a timely article, but I am afraid that the entire text is too full of "foreign" atmosphere. Here, I will write about our country's Winter Solstice, to show that we have not forgotten the "national essence."</p>
<p>The Days are Short, the Nights are Longest</p>
<p>"The Winter Solstice is as big as the New Year." This colloquial saying is almost known to all women and children. Suzhou people also have the saying "Fat Winter, Lean New Year." There is also a Shanghai proverb: "Dry and sunny Winter Solstice, wet and bland New Year; Lively Winter Solstice, Cold and bland New Year." This last sentence has the same meaning as "The Winter Solstice is as big as the New Year." The origin of this saying is probably like this:</p>
<p>First, from an astronomical point of view, the earth revolves around the sun from west to east along the ecliptic. When the sun's rays shine directly on the Tropic of Capricorn, it is the time of the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. On this day, the days are shortest, and the nights are longest. After this day, the sun begins to move north again, and the sundial gradually increases. The ancients compared the sun to the emperor, so there is the far-fetched statement that "the yang qi rises on the Winter Solstice, and the way of the ruler grows." Because "the way of the ruler grows," there are also rituals of "celebrating the Winter Solstice Grand Assembly." The etiquette is no different from the New Year's Day in the first month, and the people also have customs such as worshiping ancestors, paying respects to elders, wearing new clothes, and greeting each other, which is called "Paying Winter."</p>
<p>Paying Winter, Old Customs</p>
<p>The custom of "Paying Winter" already existed in the Han Dynasty. When it spread to Shanghai, it was probably during the Southern Song Dynasty. Qin Rongguang's "Shanghai County Bamboo Branch Song" describes the Shanghai customs of the Winter Solstice Festival, saying:</p>
<p>"Winter Solstice rice cake and glutinous rice balls, dividing winter wine to celebrate the year; After bowing and congratulating relatives and friends, piles of meat are placed on the plate to worship the ancestors."</p>
<p>Shanghai people often grind flour to make rice cakes and glutinous rice balls on the eve of the Winter Solstice, as items for worshiping ancestors and announcing the winter. Qin Nai's Miscellaneous Remarks says: "Winter Solstice sends cakes, New Year sends flour, those who don't come will also come." It can be seen that cakes and flour are not only for personal use but must also be given to relatives and friends.</p>
<p>The Eve, Worshipping Ancestors</p>
<p>Just like the eve of Christmas, the eve of the Chinese Winter Solstice, called "Winter Eve," is also quite lively. Every household, large and small, prepares food and drinks to worship ancestors, and each family takes turns inviting people to drink and feast, called "Dividing Winter Wine." "The Records of Qihua Township" states: "The night before the Winter Solstice is called Winter Solstice Night, worship ancestors and eat meat." "The Records of Songjiang Prefecture" also states: "In the eleventh month, on the Winter Solstice, prepare rice cakes, seal sheep and pigs, and worship ancestors." There must be meat for worship. The dead ancestors and spirits will not eat meat. This meat is naturally waited until after the worship, when the whole family divides and devours it. The Shanghai proverb says: "Calling for a piece of meat on Winter Solstice Night is like not having Winter Solstice." When there is meat to eat, but only one piece is eaten, one can only mock oneself by saying it is "like not having Winter Solstice."</p>
<p>Winter Morning, Paying Respects to Elders</p>
<p>On Winter Morning, scholar-official families customarily wore their official hats and belts to congratulate each other and pay respects to elders. Even rickshaw pullers and those who sell soy sauce also changed into new clothes and strolled through the city, greeting acquaintances.</p>
<p>This year's Winter Solstice is the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh lunar month, December twenty-second of the Gregorian calendar, three days before the "Foreign Winter Solstice"!</p>
<h3>Christmas in Europe</h3>
<p>London</p>
<p>After these years of war, Europe is generally much poorer this winter. In London, when early December came, housewives were already preparing their Christmas supplies and hoping to get more candy, meat and canned fruits under the strict control of the government. As for alcohol, there is very little in England, and the fine wines shipped from the continent are still on their way, obviously too late to help.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>The situation is even worse in France. The French all want to enjoy more food this winter, but food prices are rising daily. The biggest problems now - transportation difficulties and the black market - have not yet been resolved, so the French hope for Christmas food enjoyment has disappeared invisibly.</p>
<p>Belgium and Holland</p>
<p>Belgium and Holland have a relatively large number of poultry, but the quantity of other food is not enough to distribute. The worst situation is in the American occupation government within Germany, which states that food prices in Germany are still rising daily and cannot be resolved this winter. The food situation in the British occupation zone is even worse. As for the Soviet occupation zone, because the land is relatively fertile, the food situation is slightly better. Therefore, the Germans this year will still have difficulty changing their enjoyment of black bread, potatoes and cabbage from the past.</p>
<p>Romania</p>
<p>In Romania, 2 million people are using grain flour and "Red Cross soup" for the Christmas feast. Although most Romanians can enjoy better food, if the government cannot solve the food difficulty by earning a lot of income, the general people's lives cannot be improved.</p>
<p>Hungary</p>
<p>Hungary, the Christmas situation this year is a little better than in previous years, but the terrible inflation has made most Hungarians dizzy.</p>
<p>Switzerland</p>
<p>Switzerland is working hard to rebuild its travel business system, so that they can make Europeans eat better in restaurants and stay in better hotels. Other former Axis countries, such as Italy, Italians are still unable to obtain bread and inferior rations due to high prices. The government is struggling to achieve the lowest material living standards for the people, how can they talk about a Christmas of high material enjoyment?</p>
<p>Speaking of Yugoslavia, although the UN has shipped a large number of materials for relief, most Yugoslavians are still unable to obtain a better Christmas enjoyment due to the damage of the drought.</p>
<p>Greece</p>
<p>Greece is also facing high prices and worrying about the serious food problem next spring, so this year's Christmas can only "muddle through".</p>
<p>Sweden</p>
<p>Sweden's food situation is relatively normal, thanks to its proper rationing of the major foods.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In short, the situation in Europe as a whole is that there is not enough food, and people are mostly living on half-full stomachs. Bread is still out of the question, let alone turkey and roast goose? This is the second Christmas after the end of the war. This year, "Santa Claus" is coming to the earth again, and looking at this world devastated by the war, I wonder what kind of feelings will arise!</p>

<h3>Advice to Those Suffering from Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhenyi</p>
<p>In the past, many young people from various places often wrote to inquire about various issues related to neurasthenia. I once wrote an article entitled "On Neurasthenia" (published in the sixth issue of the third volume of the Chinese Health Magazine in the 30th year of the Republic [1941]) as a general response. Considering the prevalence of this ailment and the seriousness of its impact, I feel it is necessary to reiterate my views now.</p>
<p>Modern Civilization Disease</p>
<p>The term "neurasthenia" truly necessitates discussion and correction. Because when we take the name literally, we assume that the nervous system is the master of the body. So, if the nervous system is "weak," the body is bound to be severely threatened. People then recognize it as a frightening disease, leading to fear, anxiety, and bewilderment, ultimately losing the joy of life. Young people! Do you have this mistaken notion? The progress of modern medicine has, in fact, proven that the nervous tissues of these patients do not suffer the slightest damage or weakness. The real reason lies in the morbidity of their personalities, rendering them unable to cope with or overcome the hardships of life. In other words, they are truly a group of weaklings who escape from life. Therefore, some say that neurasthenia is a unique ailment of modern civilization, which contains a great deal of truth. Because the more advanced civilization becomes, the higher people's desires and the more intense their lifestyles become. Our bodies and minds often face the danger of not being able to maintain balance, just like a sturdy ship. Although it has good machinery, it cannot withstand the attacks of great storms due to being overloaded, resulting in the tragedy of capsizing. Therefore, how many young people today have suffered the misfortune of "capsizing" in the highly stressful and complex sea of life.</p>
<p>Since neurasthenia is so prevalent, this term has been deeply imprinted in people's minds, just like the term for typhoid fever. When Chinese people encounter persistent fever, regardless of the cause, they collectively call it typhoid fever. Similarly, many people who suffer from some neurological symptoms often diagnose themselves with "neurasthenia" before seeing a doctor. In fact, what people commonly call "neurasthenia" encompasses many different diseases. In psychiatry, we call this type of disease "psychoneurosis." We see these types of patients in our clinics every day. They have numerous complaints. They often write down a long list of various symptoms in advance and hand it to the doctor, and they bring different new complaints at each visit. Although many patients suffer from mild mental illnesses, such as "obsessive-compulsive disorder," "hand-washing mania," and various "phobias," most patients suffer from hyperesthesia, neurasthenia (we will temporarily use this term until we have a more appropriate term), hypochondria, hysteria, and anxiety states.</p>
<p>Typical Patients</p>
<p>A typical neurasthenia patient often feels tired, forgetful, unable to concentrate easily, has headaches, backaches, insomnia, nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, pessimism, disappointment, depression, and feelings of inferiority. Patients with hypochondria are overly sensitive to their body's functions. The symptoms produced are often limited to various organs of the body. We often encounter patients who complain that their heart function has stopped, their gastrointestinal tract is ulcerated, their internal organs have shifted positions, and the blood in their brain has congealed into clots, and other strange sensations. I once met a middle-aged woman who complained that there was a "turtle" in her abdomen, and therefore she was fearful and anxious all day long, leading to starvation. A patient with hysteria often resembles a truly ill person, with symptoms such as numbness, loss of sensation, paralysis, blindness, [omission], feeling like they are becoming [omission], mental derangement, patients with anxiety [omission] often experience paroxysmal palpitations, sweating, feelings of suffocation, fear of death, mental tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation [omission]. Patients themselves will feel anxious and [omission] their symptoms.</p>
<p>When these patients complain of various neurological sensitivities, worries, insomnia, fears, and other vague symptoms, general doctors feel that since the physical examination reveals no morbidity, it is not worth spending more time. They often readily diagnose "hypersensitivity" or "neurasthenia," write a prescription for a sedative, and consider it done. Sometimes they may impatiently say to the patient, "These are all illusions; there's nothing wrong." In fact, their suffering and symptoms are absolutely real to them. Therefore, this allows the patient to go from one doctor to another, wasting time and money, which is so heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Key Psychological Points</p>
<p>We know that the functions of the nervous system can be divided into several levels. The higher psychological level is located in the cerebral cortex, representing a person's thoughts and mental life. The lower physiological level is located in the medulla oblongata, representing automatic physiological functions such as circulation, respiration, and digestion. Psychological influences are constantly emitted from the cortical center to control physiological functions. In other words, there are connecting neurons between the higher and lower centers, resulting in a harmonious, balanced, and unified state, representing the entire life of a healthy person. There are two opposing forces between the cerebral cortex and the medulla oblongata—excitation and inhibition. We have not yet understood the fundamental nature of these two forces, but we know for sure that they exist. Without these forces, we would have no controlled life. With them, the capabilities of the nervous system are effectively expressed. Physiologically, the excitatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart and the inhibitory influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on the heart are clear facts. In the psychological realm, we can also see the excitatory effect of instinct and the inhibiting power of conscience. These two opposing psychological forces cause various psychological conflicts in humans, which are also the basis for maladjustment.</p>
<p>The two lower levels of personality are habit and instinct, and the two higher levels are wisdom and reason. If each level is not properly adjusted, it is the root cause of psychoneurosis. When the emotional impact and sympathetic nervous system produced by this conflict cause functional disorders, various visceral, glandular, joint, muscle, circulatory, and other symptoms arise. When it affects the function of the cerebral cortex, it produces various special psychological disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. The above points are the psycho-pathological analyses of neurasthenia and other psychoneuroses by modern scholars.</p>
<p>The Connection Between Body and Mind</p>
<p>Physiologist Cannon has also pointed out that fear and other emotional tensions can produce physiological changes. When fearful, excessive secretion of adrenaline causes palpitations, sweating, pupil dilation, cessation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion, and changes in metabolism. Other emotions such as worry, anxiety, disappointment, and anticipation can produce the same physiological changes. From this, we can understand that in the long term, tension, fear, irritability, and anxiety can change the function of normal organs, causing discomfort and abnormal sensations. Other life problems such as economic difficulties, sexual dysfunction, regret over masturbation, discord in work interests, conflicts in religious beliefs, discord in the family, and worries about childbirth and contraception can all form factors of hyperesthesia or neurasthenia. Patients with hypochondria are often well-cared-for, only children spoiled by their parents. Their parents have never given them an opportunity to be independent. Therefore, they become dependent by nature. They also don't know what difficulty is. But good times don't last long. Parents cannot provide shelter for them for a lifetime. Once they encounter difficulties, they have no strength to overcome them. This leads to various pathologies of the body's organs to escape from difficult reality, seeking temporary inner peace. In hysteria and obsessive-compulsive disorder, those past repressed and fragmented experiences are the root cause of the disease.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia and other various psychoneuroses are all due to their "special personality" and the reactions it causes to life experiences. This "special personality" is often formed in childhood. We often see these "neurotic" children, whose initial unstable emotional manifestations include timidity, shyness, submission, fear, nightmares, irritability, bed-wetting, nail-biting, unstable vasomotor function, protein allergies, allergic reactions, urticaria, eczema, asthma, and other phenomena. Adolescence is a critical period for shaping the personality of adults. These emotionally unstable young people often have hypersensitivity, excessive worry about future difficulties, dissatisfaction, and loneliness, or premature, diminished, or abnormal sexual development. Many young people also regard sexual issues as mysterious and obscene, seeking sexual satisfaction in fantasy. Therefore, on the surface, these people appear calm, but their hearts are actually shy, timid, hesitant, and irresolute. Once they encounter difficulties in life, they lack the willpower to struggle, and various neurological symptoms arise to escape. Strictly speaking, any of us will have this symptom response if we encounter extraordinary difficulties, but neurotic people cannot cope with even the most ordinary setbacks and quickly produce various reactions.</p>
<p>As for the physical aspect, these people are also not very robust. They often suffer from underweight, visceral ptosis, spastic constipation, colitis, and require more time for sleep and rest than ordinary people. We also often find that their tendon reflexes are enhanced, the sympathetic nervous system is overactive, prone to facial flushing, skin writing, blood rings, and vascular instability, menstrual irregularities, and carbohydrate and water imbalance phenomena.</p>
<p>Personality and Physique</p>
<p>We know that the whole person encompasses both the body and mind. Therefore, we must consider both aspects when studying or diagnosing a patient, so as not to have any negligence. When encountering this type of patient, the first thing to do is to understand their individual, physique, and complete life record. Everyone's personality is different, including their physiological or biological components, their special emotional composition, and their intelligence. Many are inherited, and many are acquired from life experiences. We [omission] personality is formed by the fusion of life experiences and our inherent nature. Only this harmonious fusion can allow people to work, play, and rest to form a precise balance. In certain neurotic people, any of these traits are threatened and cannot be tolerated, and neurological symptoms arise. If the doctor is willing to listen quietly to the patient's account of their life story and adopts a serious attitude, using an objective perspective, it is not difficult to understand the patient's personality. Only in this way can the pathogenic mechanism be discovered. Everything in childhood can represent the prototype of personality. School performance can indicate the level of intelligence. Professional success or failure can represent a person's inherent trust and perseverance. In addition, from a person's marital and sexual life, we can also discover what they are worried about. Fear of pregnancy, sexual dissatisfaction, discord between husband and wife, and worries and fears about masturbation are all important factors.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, masturbation, nocturnal emissions, impotence, and premature ejaculation can be said to be symptoms that most neurasthenia patients will complain about. Here, I must point out a correct concept. Masturbation is indeed a bad habit, but the influence of masturbation itself is not great. Rather, the attitude of society toward masturbation is very important. Shame, goodwill, and anger are mixed together in the consciousness, causing very bad consequences in the spirit. In other words, the main harm of masturbation lies in the struggle with this mentality. Similarly, nocturnal emission is originally a normal physiological phenomenon for healthy young people before the start of sexual life. More than four or five nocturnal emissions per month is considered pathological. Often, young people do not have accurate medical knowledge. Whenever this physiological phenomenon occurs, coupled with the promotion of improper pharmaceutical advertisements in newspapers, it causes great fear, which is very harmful. However, when the number of occurrences has increased abnormally, of course, a specialist should be consulted for examination. As for impotence and premature ejaculation, a specialist should be consulted for examination. Reading newspapers and taking medicine is the most foolish thing to do. According to the results of current medical research, most patients with impotence and premature ejaculation are due to neurotic fear, childish timidity, and the inability to adapt to society. From this, it can be seen that treating these patients is not only effective by taking medicine and injections. The most important thing is to start from the psychological aspect.</p>
<p>Pay Attention, Young People!</p>
<p>Recently, this newspaper has repeatedly received letters from many readers inquiring about various issues related to neurasthenia. In addition to having replied individually, here I would like to bring up a common traditional misconception shared by most young people—kidney deficiency and neurasthenia—whether the terms kidney deficiency and yin deficiency are terms used by old Chinese medicine, which is a mistaken concept without scientific and victorious foundation. We know that the function of the kidneys is to specialize in excretion and is the factory for making urine, which is fundamentally unrelated to the common symptoms of general neurasthenia patients—nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, and impotence. Because of "deficiency," it needs to be "replenished." Furthermore, because of the confusion between the kidneys and the function of the gonads, injections and medicines with pleasant terms such as "hormones" and "賜保命" (a life preserving substance) are regarded as the only good medicine for "tonifying." Moreover, due to the promotion of various improper medicines, patients flock to them, wasting money and suffering in vain, which is so foolish!</p>
<p>Be optimistic! People with neuroses, you must not be pessimistic, disappointed, or anxious. You must not be deceived by misleading advertisements, wasting money and time. Injections and medicines are futile for this disease. Only understanding, encouragement, and inspiration can allow you to re-evaluate your own value and return to the world of people, work, entertainment, and love.</p>

<h3>The Attitude We Should Have Towards the Mentally Ill</h3>
<p>— Liu Yeci</p>
<p>In our lives, we will always encounter crazy mentally ill people on the street a few times. As soon as they are discovered, we can immediately see many pedestrians circling around them, standing and watching as if enjoying a kind of play game, unwilling to leave. If we carefully observe those spectators, we will find that their attitudes toward the patients are all different. Some arbitrarily ridicule and criticize the patients, as if they have finally found a topic of conversation. Some are indifferent, seeing as if they have not seen, hearing as if they have not heard, and have no special expression toward the patients, just watching. Some sigh at the patients as if they are a little pitying. If the patients are going crazy and singing loudly, making many strange expressions, we can see that the audience will immediately burst into laughter in unison. Suddenly seeing the patients naked, [omission], we will again [omission], shut them in a room, not allowing them to come out again. People without family members will also be homeless and have nowhere to rest. From the above attitudes, we can deeply see that if a person unfortunately suffers from mental illness, in addition to being gloated over and ridiculed by others, what they get from the environment is only contempt, insult, jokes, and scolding, without getting the sympathy that human beings deserve.</p>
<p>Since traditional wrong attitudes are like this, if a family has a mentally ill person, because the family members first discriminate against the patient, according to the psychology of "judging others by oneself," the family members must also be afraid that others will discriminate against the patient. Therefore, most are unwilling to mention it to others. At the same time, because the patient often causes trouble during the period of madness, they simply keep him locked in a room, not allowing him to run out. As long as he does not make noise, that is enough. Of course, he is not allowed to share meals with his family every day, and it is enough to give him a portion. If relatives and friends occasionally mention the patient, the family members will definitely use other words to conceal the situation for the patient. Firstly, people generally do not know that mental illness can also be treated, always thinking it is the work of gods and ghosts. Secondly, it is to save the family's face, fearing embarrassment. Even if they know that mental illness can be treated, they are unwilling to seek treatment. Furthermore, because the patient [omission], everything [omission] situation [omission] patients, I really don't know how many there are.</p>
<p>Therefore, [omission] or in today's so-called civilized society, whenever and wherever, as long as the word "crazy person" is mentioned, people mostly [omission] have a kind of fear and discrimination toward them. Their mentality is that the patient is "finished for this life." In fact, the facts tell us that people suffering from mental illness are no different from people suffering from other illnesses. As long as they are treated properly, their chances of recovery are the same. After they recover, they can also do a great and magnificent career like ordinary people. For example, in 1900, there was a top student at Yale University in the United States named Clifford Beers, who was a person who had suffered from mental illness for two years. After he recovered, he not only wrote a most valuable book entitled "A Mind That Found Itself," which made extremely valuable contributions to the medical community. Moreover, he continued to work hard and became the initiator of the mental hygiene movement. In our country, we have heard that there was a Mr. Luo Feng, who was also a scholar who had suffered from mental illness. After he recovered, he retold his experiences and insights of getting sick. In 1944, he also published a book entitled "Crazy August Notes." After the book was published, its contribution to medicine was even greater. Comparing China and the West, their achievements are equal. Their ability to work after illness is beyond what ordinary people can compare.</p>
<p>In short, mental illness is no different from other diseases, because it is also a disease and is not surprising. People suffering from mental illness are no different from people suffering from other diseases, so it is not strange. If we have lung disease, we dare to boldly seek medical treatment. If we have mental illness, we should also go to seek medical treatment immediately. Since we love and protect people suffering from lung disease, we should love and protect people suffering from mental illness even more. After they get sick, they should also enjoy the same treatment, because they are sick, not guilty of a crime. At the same time, we should have already realized that we should not beat them, scold them, and not give them inhumane treatment.</p>

<h3>Unfold Literary and Art Construction</h3>
<p>— Wu Mintai</p>
<p>Literature and art are a symbol of the spirit of resistance, a kind of life cried out in times of life's brevity, suffering, pain, and anger! It is all kinds of strange and varied living facts in human society. Through the power of their images, it arouses the sensitive and emotional abundance of writers, emitting sounds of groaning, shouting, angry lamentations, weeping, satire, protest, appeals, or praise. It is then created and expressed through language and words as a kind of art! It should not only truthfully expose reality on the surface, reflect society, depict darkness, and extol light, but it should also provide a true and realistic life thought that is sufficient to awaken and alert the people from the cruel reality, excavate the truth of the darkness, ugliness, and harm hidden behind the light and beauty, and then pierce the filth and pus wrapped in the tumors! Therefore, we can say that literature and art are the driving force for promoting social evolution, the breast milk for nourishing the human soul!</p>
<p>Of course, we don't need to particularly emphasize that the power of literature and art far surpasses the range of guns! Nor do we need to particularly exaggerate that the effect of literature and art is more important than the battles of soldiers, but the spiritual function of literature and art in assisting the War of Resistance and national construction and stimulating national thought and patriotic emotions is very obvious and cannot be denied by anyone!</p>
<p>In the past, the literary and artistic youth of our country were always unafraid of the powerful and unafraid of dangers. First, they used the pen as a weapon that used ink to create blood, to awaken the deaf, to sweep away demons, and acted as the pioneers of the times and the vanguards of the revolution! Now, in this transitional and turbulent period of national construction, the literary and artistic people of the whole country should continue their efforts, actively carry out literary and artistic construction, and actively build a healthy and solid literary and artistic fortress to defeat those works containing toxins, absurdities, and obscenities. Facing the turbid, treacherous, ugly, and evil reality, they should use a pen that resembles steel rubbing against steel, iron colliding with iron, blood and sweat exchanging, and is full of a positive fighting atmosphere to point out the errors of the times, expose the darkness of society, express the suffering of the masses, and further point out a correct and bright path for the future era!</p>
<p>Literary and artistic youths, the times are calling us, let us densely concentrate our firepower! Let us hold hands tightly!</p>
<h3>A Button</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>On a desolate journey, braving the chilling wind, I walked for a day. My hands were frostbitten, and my legs felt incredibly heavy. It was less like walking and more like dragging myself along step by step. The bamboo cane in my hand trailed on the ground, making a weary sound. Seeing that the sun was about to set and my shadow lengthening, I couldn't help but feel a little apprehensive.</p>
<p>Just then, I suddenly saw a small mountain town ahead. The sign of a small roadside restaurant and the flames from the stove beckoned me. How delighted I was!</p>
<p>I hurried towards it. The woman tending the stove looked to be around thirty. She wore a set of blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers and had a floral cloth tied around her head, the picture of simple country attire. The firelight made her round face glow red.</p>
<p>Although I was a weary traveler, she showed no hint of disdain towards me or my small bag. On the contrary, she treated me with great hospitality. She took care of everything without me having to worry. First, she arranged a place for me to sleep. Although it was just straw laid out, I found it as comfortable as a Simmons mattress. Then she brought me a basin of water to wash my face and a large pot of tea. Although the water in the basin contained a lot of grit and the towel wasn't very clean, my frostbitten cheeks and hands were desperate for warmth, so I didn't mind. The tea made from roasted soybeans had a hint of coffee flavor, and I happily drank it down. A steamed bun and a bowl of hot millet porridge, eaten with salted soybeans, tasted incredibly delicious.</p>
<p>After the meal, a kerosene lamp was placed on the table next to my bed. By then, the restaurant door was closed, the street was very quiet, and wild animals in the mountains were making frightening howls.</p>
<p>Without me asking, she placed a basin of boiled water on the floor for me to soak my feet. My swollen feet felt instantly relieved of the day's journey after being soaked in the hot water. As I soaked my feet, I chatted with her, from the situation in the town to the details of her restaurant. She was as quick with her words as she was with her actions. She told me that her husband gambled and drank all day and only came home late at night. She took care of everything in the restaurant, and there was also an elderly mother-in-law in her sixties who had already gone to the back room to sleep before it got dark. As she spoke, there seemed to be tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>After soaking my feet, she rinsed my wet socks in the water. After rinsing them, she put them by the stove to dry.</p>
<p>"They'll be dry overnight, and you can wear them again in the morning!" she said.</p>
<p>At the same time, she noticed that a few buttons on my cotton-padded jacket were about to fall off. She found a needle and thread and insisted on sewing them on for me.</p>
<p>"Lie down and take off your jacket!"</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry!"</p>
<p>"No, it's no trouble for me to sew on a few stitches. I know how hard it is for people traveling away from home!"</p>
<p>The kerosene lamp flickered, and she trimmed the wick with the needle tip, bringing it closer to the light as she sewed the buttons on for me. The needle and thread passed through the cloth jacket, making a soft sound, echoing her quiet breathing.</p>
<p>As she finished sewing, she told me:</p>
<p>"You're missing a button on your coat!"</p>
<p>"It's alright if I am!"</p>
<p>"No, it's not warm enough to wear if you're missing a button!" With that, she quickly took off a similar black button from her own underclothes.</p>
<p>"But then I have a button, and you don't!"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter about me, you have to travel early tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>A traveler accustomed to the coldness of society never expected to receive such human warmth in a small mountain town restaurant.</p>
<p>The next morning, I set off on my journey again. The rising sun shone on my cotton-padded jacket, and the last, larger black button reflected the light.</p>
<h3>Recording Liu Kuizhong's Paintings and Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Yu Liuhua</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I saw the Huaibei painter Liu Kuizhong in Shanghai. His flower paintings were influenced by Wu [Changshuo], and his medical practices by Qing Daoren. He had already established himself. This year, he came to Shanghai again and showed me his recent works. They were completely different, completely shedding his old habits, with no trace of his former style. His rapid progress is truly remarkable.</p>
<p>Since Lin Liangjian's ink wash freehand style in the Ming Dynasty, Zhou Zhimian created the outline-flower and dot-leaf style. Xu Tianchi, with his innate talent, painted freely and unconstrainedly, with everything as he wished, and freehand flower painting reached its peak. In the early Qing Dynasty, Shi Tao expressed it with a bold and unrestrained brush, and Bada used an ancient brush, achieving perfection without seeking it. Later, Li Futang used a twisting and turning brush, similar to Zhou Zhimian; Gai Xinluo used a delicate and elegant brush, writing freehand but close to meticulous brushwork. In the late Qing Dynasty, Zhao Zhiqian and Wu Rangzhi used the brushwork of writing Wei steles to create broad and vibrant paintings, with a unique interest. In the early Republic of China, Wu Changshuo wrote flower paintings with the brushwork of seal script, with a rough and wild style full of rustic and profound air. For a time, scholars followed suit, forming a grand trend. However, many who imitated him stuck to the old methods, not knowing how to change, and gradually became disliked. Only Liu Jun refused to be confined by Wu's style, transforming from rough and wild to elegant, from ancient and clumsy to clear and spiritual. Tracing back from Zhao Zhiqian and Li Futang to Zhou Zhimian, he is implicitly the orthodox of flower painting, with no bad habit of using large amounts of red and green, and is truly worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Qing Daoren used twists and turns to write inscriptions on bronze vessels and official script, which is certainly interesting, but ultimately not found in ancient methods. His brushwork is too restrained, and his spirit is not smooth, inevitably giving the impression of artificiality. Liu Jun's initial study of Qing Daoren is similar to his flower paintings influenced by Wu Changshuo. Recently, he has gradually transformed Qing Daoren's square and clumsy style, returning the inscriptions on bronze vessels and official script to their original appearance, incorporating twists and turns into fluidity, solid without being stagnant, and gorgeous without being superficial. Few contemporary calligraphers can do this. His cursive script is especially pure, skilled, and unrestrained, not falling into the stereotypes of modern people. Learning and being able to change, and changing to a higher level, Liu Jun's attainments are truly limitless.</p>
<p>Liu Jun recently exhibited several hundred of his recent works at the Chinese Painting Academy. Those who love this art should go and see them, so as to prove that my words are not wrong.</p>
<h3>Palm Tree</h3>
<p>— Liu Kuizhong</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 127</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"A young shop assistant at the counter, the department manager saw that she was capable and introduced her to the 'First Store' to do chores two months ago. In less than a week, the general manager of the First Store saw that she was charming and very clever and picked her to work in the office. Last night, she saw the boss of the 'Introduction Agency' with her own eyes and admired him very much. The boss's experiences in the First Store were all conveyed by her. Our department manager discovered that she was very loyal and could be promoted to the mountain-level service category, so he charged her with finding out the news of the 'goods'. Coincidentally, she was very familiar with the 'goods' storage department, and she sorted things out this morning. So the department manager told me to get to the boss within five hours..."</p>
<p>This is the usual way of talking in Tsurumi's secret organization, but it needs to be interpreted:</p>
<p>In secret conversations, Tsurumi's organization refers to itself as "Introduction Agency", "Department Store", or "Translation Agency", etc.; depending on which nature is suitable for the environment, it uses the "jargon" of which organization to talk. The roles of the subordinates are roughly divided into three classes; the highest-class confidants, about twenty in total, are all comrades of life and death selected by Tsurumi over the years, each of whom not only has expertise, is shrewd and capable, but also shares the same interests, and their numbers all start with "0". Some are in charge of one of the twelve secret radio stations, and some hold special positions; such as "04" in Changxindian, "012" in Tokyo, etc.</p>
<p>Under these senior confidants, there are two or three classes of workers; the second class is the confidants of the first class, and the third class is the confidants of the second class. These two classes are also divided into A, B, and C grades. The maintenance styles of these "confidants" are of various kinds. As mentioned earlier, some want to be promoted and make a fortune, while others are special, such as revenge, or appreciation, or spontaneous friendship, or the same interests, or members of secret societies in other countries. However, they only have a "vertical" organization and no "horizontal" relationship. Even this vertical organization is limited to one level, that is, his or her direct contact person.</p>
<p>One difference between this organization and other secret societies is that the number of cadres is more than the total number of the second and third classes combined by two or three; because most of the subordinates with "0" at the beginning have no underlings. Other than that, most of them are temporary employees and cannot be counted within the organization.</p>
<p>The "First Store" mentioned above refers to the current cabinet, and the general manager is of course referring to Konoe. According to the oral report of Wild Boar, the person who found out the location of the "Seven Secret Instruments" was a woman named Yoshida Maruko. 012 found a way to get her to Konoe's villa to work as a chore worker, and Konoe took a fancy to her and chose her as one of the concubines, successfully creating a very useful internal line. Since 012 went to solve the six guys who were unfavorable to Tsurumi and were driven away by the Fifth Column, and Tsurumi was forced by Konoe to meet with him, he then ordered Maruko to randomly protect Tsurumi internally. As soon as this Maruko saw Tsurumi, she obeyed him with twelve sincerity and was willing to die for him.</p>
<p>It is not that the author advocates "heroism" to make Tsurumi so heroic, causing people to fall in love with him at first sight and simply becoming a "superman". But Japanese women inherently have this kind of "little hen" personality, loving vanity, loving men, and loving heroes. Even if you are a rickshaw puller, as long as you are a strong man who runs faster than others, she will admire you. What's more, among the 35 million strong men in Japan (according to the Japanese population survey in 1935, whether it is true or false, the author is not responsible), apart from a very small number of Western mixed breeds (Japan has been a mixed blood since the Meiji Restoration, except for a small number of aboriginal fishermen in Hokkaido), where can you see a handsome man like Tsurumi? Therefore, it is no wonder that this "little hen" fell in love at first sight.</p>
<p>(In fact, compared to young people in their twenties in our country, Tsurumi is not particularly handsome and romantic, but he is just well-proportioned, brave, spirited, and has a dashing appearance, which makes people pleasing to the eye.)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Meeting</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Democratic politics cannot be separated from the form of meetings. In meetings, one can record a person, whether it is their cultivation, demeanor, wit, or decisiveness. People praise the British Parliament, and people also know that British politicians are influenced by the Parliament. The history of Disraeli, the last prime minister of the Victorian dynasty, struggling in Parliament for forty years will move those who read history.</p>
<p>Our National Assembly has been in session for thirty-four days. One thousand two to three people have come from all over to gather in Nanjing, discussing the constitution. Although there have been many ups and downs and disputes, the overall progress has been good. We may still be learning, but this first lesson in democratic politics cannot be considered bad.</p>
<p>Let people speak their minds, even if they are wrong, they have that right. Don't look down on those representatives who have traveled thousands of miles. As long as they say a word or two at the assembly, they will forget their hard work, and they will have gotten their worth.</p>
<p>During these thirty-four days of the meeting, many scenes are worthy of our special appreciation. Here, let us mention the words of Fu Sinian, Jiang Yuntian, and Chen Qitian in the Comprehensive Review Committee on the 18th (see the Nanjing special telegram on the first page of yesterday's newspaper):</p>
<p>Fu Sinian: I am not determined to maintain the previous resolution in order to achieve my personal goals, but due to spiritual feelings, I believe that my soul has not given any guarantees to others and should have the freedom to speak. ... I do not expect to overturn this review motion with this reason, but only hope to include it in the record.</p>
<p>Jiang Yuntian: I propose to postpone the decision on this issue and wait for all parties to sincerely negotiate again. First, the role of our minority party in the meeting can only be realized through reason and emotion. If we rely on the right to vote, it is difficult to achieve any goals, which is what we do not want; second, for this point of contention, even if the Kuomintang uses its strict discipline to make all party members give up their claims, there will inevitably be unhappiness in their emotions, which is also what we do not want. Third, only the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party participated in this arduous task of constitution-making. We must pay attention to the intentions of those who did not participate, so that our resolutions can be agreed upon and accepted...</p>
<p>Chen Qitian: It is impossible for several parties to fully agree on a decision on one matter. It is already a good thing to seek the next best thing and achieve general satisfaction.</p>
<p>Calm and rational, reasonable and approachable, embodying the demeanor of a fighter for democratic politics.</p>
<p>The common people are not without eyes. Every movement, every silence, every word, and every smile in the assembly is being closely watched. Because they are both supervising and learning.</p>
<h3>The Third Master is Truly Miraculous</h3>
<p>— Mo</p>
<p>The child of the Wang family in the front building could not get out of bed due to fever and chills, which made Mrs. Wang very anxious.</p>
<p>The good old woman in the pavilion room suggested that they had encountered filth - the Red Devil, and that they only needed to send soup and rice and burn tin foil at night. Mrs. Wang obeyed.</p>
<p>Sending soup and rice and burning tin foil, the fever and chills were still very severe. So the sister-in-law in the back building, seeing what was right, spoke out righteously. According to her idea, they should call a "spirit medium" to "look at the incense head." Mrs. Wang only wanted her son to get better, so she agreed to everything.</p>
<p>The result of the spirit medium was that the stars were bad, and that Taoists needed to resolve the stars. At the same time, they had to use a pig's head and three animals to make a vow at the temple. The more money and food they offered, the faster the disease would get better. Mrs. Wang said "O.K." to everything.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang's son's condition only worsened. The landlady complained to Mrs. Wang, "The child is so sick, why don't you go to 'Third Master's' place on Baik Road to ask for a fairy prescription. 'Third Master' is truly miraculous. The hemorrhoid problem of my eldest daughter's father, no one knows how many doctors he saw without any effect. Later, 'Third Master' cured it and also granted him a child. Isn't Auntie Jie in the kitchen now three months pregnant because she asked 'Third Master'?..."</p>
<p>"Third Master's" fairy prescription was like plain water. After taking it, the condition only worsened. It was not until then that they thought of a doctor, but it had been more than two weeks since the disease had started.</p>
<p>The doctor prescribed a prescription and said to Mrs. Wang, "This prescription is only to open the way. Its effect is very weak. It is best to buy and take his secret medicine powder. The mixed material costs 100,000 yuan per dose, and the single material costs 60,000 yuan per dose. At least three doses must be taken." Mrs. Wang hoped that her son would recover as soon as possible, so she naturally bought the double material in wholesale, taking out 300,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Immortals do not recognize pills and powders. Who can figure out what kind of medicine is synthesized in this medicine powder? Only heaven knows. As the saying goes, "Although no one sees the cultivation and combination, heaven knows whether the intention is good." However, the doctor's chauffeur understood, because this medicine powder was made by the chauffeur in the "iron boat." It is said that these are the main ingredients: "Winter mulberry leaves, Tianhua powder, Rehmannia glutinosa, etc." It is guaranteed that it will not harm you, but it will not cure the disease either.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang's son only took two doses of the medicine powder and was sent to the funeral home. Many people said that killing a living child was a given and said that the child's "life was exhausted."</p>
<h3>Human Market</h3>
<p>— Cai Lin</p>
<p>"Human Market" is another name for "Introduction Agency", that is, "Matchmaker Shop".</p>
<p>Most Human Markets are located near the vegetable market. The business hours of the Human Market are strictly before the vegetable market closes in the morning.</p>
<p>The goods in the Human Market are like the pickled pigs in the salt goods store in the Sixteenth Concession. The so-called stock is piled up like a mountain, including maids, older women, seamstresses, needleworkers, wet nurses, governesses, strong ones, dry ones, pretty ones, and ugly ones, young rickshaw pullers, everything you can imagine, too much to list in detail.</p>
<p>The owner of the Human Market is not only well-known in Shanghai, but also in the countryside. If a maid's hands and feet are not clean and she steals someone's things, she runs to the countryside with the "thirty-six tricks." The Human Market owner still has a way to bring her back to Shanghai without disturbing the "fixer." Therefore, the Human Market has excellent credit, more "flexible" than several "shaky" "banks".</p>
<p>The Human Market owner's "brain" is also very active. When a customer comes to the door, he treats them as warmly as the old men in the barber shop. If a female customer comes to the door, the owner will definitely call out a few old maids for an interview. Conversely, if a male customer comes to the door, he will try his best to choose a young older woman for the guest. If they hit it off and a recommendation is successful, then the owner has "ups and downs" to take, which is exactly two-sided income.</p>
<p>The Human Market is closed in the afternoon. There is often a table of "mahjong" in the store. Everyone gambles on credit, and they pay back the money when business comes, but "tips" are caught on the spot and never owed.</p>
<p>The second floor of several Human Markets on XX Road is temporarily used as a "platform" for young maids to circle on the street. If an impatient womanizer "stalks" and they talk to each other, a deal can be made. The price of a one-night stand still has to be "halved" with the boss. These few "Human Markets" are even more worthy of the name.</p>
<h3>Sharing Wonderful Articles</h3>
<p>— Translated by Tian Shi from "Magazine Digest"</p>
<p>A certain pharmaceutical factory produced a nerve sedative; in order to promote its efficacy, it publicly solicited testimonial letters from users. The first prize-winning article is recorded as follows: "I don't know how to recommend it, but I can report a factual experience, which proves that your factory's products are of good quality and have miraculous effects. My wife is the most nervous woman in the world. No one dares to sleep with her, but since taking a bottle of your factory's sleeping potion, almost anyone can 'sleep in the same bed' with her."</p>
<h3>What Secrets Does the Atomic Bomb Have?</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Zhongheng from the Chicago Sun-Times</p>
<p>"The atomic bomb has absolutely no secrets to speak of." If you don't believe it, we can get a new proof from the following dramatic story. The person telling the story is the young Dr. Philip Morris, who is an atomic expert researching atomic bombs for the government and one of the first investigators to go to Hiroshima, Japan, to investigate the destructive power of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>As soon as he arrived in Hiroshima, he met Professor Nishina Yoshio of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research of Japan. This Professor Nishina Yoshio was studying atomic bombs in a "family laboratory" with equipment worth less than 20 US dollars. He has not read the Sims report, which is a description of some atomic bomb secrets by the US Department of Defense. Professor Nishina's research was based only on the consequences of the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima.</p>
<p>However, Professor Nishina has compiled the main facts about atomic bombs into a book. And strangely, several situations that are generally considered big secrets by Americans have already been known by Dr. Nishina. Not only that, but according to Dr. Philip, Professor Nishina has already found the "way" in all aspects of atomic bomb research, but all he has is equipment worth only twenty dollars, the amount of money an average high school student has.</p>
<p>The reason why Dr. Philip wants to make this story public is to let people know that as long as there is appropriate equipment, a scientist like Professor Nishina can know the secrets of atomic bombs in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The meaning of Dr. Philip is very obvious: since the atomic bomb has no secrets to keep, the only effective way to preserve it is to use the power of the whole world to control atomic bombs and other weapons of war.</p>

<h3>Protect Morality</h3>
<p>— Jun Ji</p>
<p>Yesterday, another case of road police beating military police occurred in the Great Light Theater.</p>
<p>Please see the obedience of the American soldiers to their "MPs" and "SPs." Not a single soldier dares to be presumptuous in front of them. Even in defeated Japan, during the occupied period, I once saw a Japanese junior sergeant being slapped and kicked by the military police very "obediently." From this, we can see the existence of military discipline and our country.</p>
<h3>"God Sniper"</h3>
<p>— Dong Jishi</p>
<p>In the movie "God Sniper," relying on a machine gun, he was able to capture 132 German soldiers alive. He is truly worthy of being a "God Sniper"!</p>
<p>In Chinese society, there are "God Snipers" instead of "God Gunners"! The skills of this kind of God Sniper are specialized in "snatching money," being able to snatch the money of thousands of people into his pocket unknowingly, without any "effort." It can truly be said to be "miraculous." He is also worthy of being a "God Sniper"!</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, and these days, the "God Snipers" are in full swing, snatching a ticket for the New Year! As the Suzhou people call it, "killing the New Year's Eve."</p>
<p>This group of "God Snipers" is the master of "hoarding," "manipulating," "profiteering," and "speculating," arbitrarily raising prices!</p>

<h3>Kind and Tactful - He Chengjuan</h3>
<p>— Mi Shan</p>
<p>The National Assembly had a very heated debate over the draft constitution, and the person presiding over the tenth plenary meeting was He Chengjuan, one of the chairmen of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Anyone who has paid a little attention to the history of the Republic of China will remember that He Chengjuan is a soldier of political reason. He is frugal and has a very deep city in his heart. Although he came from a military academy, he has always been good at dealing with all parties and is tactful and sophisticated, which is very rare among Chinese soldiers.</p>
<p>He's style name is Xuezhu, and he is from Suixian County, Hubei Province. He is sixty-five years old this year. He has been involved in the revolution for forty-three years since he was twenty-two years old, and he is very qualified. When Father [Sun Yat-sen] was building the country in Guangdong, he served as a military advisor in the Grand Marshal's Mansion, and he was lost in the crowd and failed to display his talents. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Chairman Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek] sent troops to the Northern Expedition. Seeing that He had great talent, he was promoted to chief counselor of the National Revolutionary Army and chief representative stationed in Shanghai. He was promoted to prominence and everything went smoothly. When the Gui faction rebelled, the government appointed He as the director of the Beiping Military Camp to clean up the Gui faction's rebel army in the north. The war was extinguished, and He also contacted Yan Xishan and Zhang Xueliang to help him. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he began to enter the political arena and became the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government.</p>
<p>At that time, the director of finance of the Hubei Provincial Government under the leadership of He was Wu Guozhen, the current mayor of Shanghai, and the director of civil affairs was Liu Wendao, who was "fighting tigers." To use a common saying, it can be said to be a "grand lineup, unparalleled in strength."</p>
<p>He is generous and can endure humiliation and bear burdens. If colleagues have difficulties with him, Director He pretends to be stupid and allows them to ridicule and mock him. He has been in charge of Hubei politics for several years, unlike the domineering and arrogant style of ordinary people. He also likes to socialize and does not put on airs. There is such a legendary story: He is good at playing football and is known as "He the Invincible." He once closed a sports field for people to wander around. He also often came to compete with others in his spare time. The story happened like this: A certain division commander had a grudge against He and bribed a disciple of a Sichuan abbot named Wang, teaching him to often wander around the sports field and take the opportunity to "injure" He. Who knew that He saw Wang, loved his martial arts, and made a deep connection with him. Wang was grateful for He's kindness and remembered his master's three precepts and six prohibitions, and he couldn't help but regret it greatly. He told He all about his original intention. He was quite shocked at first, and then he was calm and had no grudges against the division commander. Those who knew about it admired He's generosity.</p>
<p>Someone compared He to Zhuge Wuhou of the Three Kingdoms period. Although the comparison is very far-fetched, it is not without three points of similarity.</p>
