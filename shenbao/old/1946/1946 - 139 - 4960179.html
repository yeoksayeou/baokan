<p>〔中央社錦州十八日電〕熱河共軍自昨日起，以十七個旅之龐大兵力，向西起平泉，東迄北票之國軍防綫發動全面總攻，國軍截至昨晚十二時，仍在奮力抵抗中。共軍此舉純係有計劃之行動，執行部赤峯小組自共方代表飛承德後，政府與美方人員即遭共軍拘禁，赤峯機塲亦於上週間遭共軍澈底破壞，使負責聯絡之飛機無法降落，朝陽小組亦因共方代表拒不到任，無法展開工作，熱河各小組聯席會議，早適於四日中旬召集，初以地點問題，雙方爭持不下，美方提議，共方復以食糧困難，一再抱延時日，嗣經三方決議，會期定五月八日，共方又以指揮官不擬參加為詞，拒不簽發請帖，致調處工作陷於停頓，共軍乃於此時乘機發動攻勢，企圖於短期內消滅國軍第十三之主力，佔領熱河全境，造成旣成事實，然後伺機進攻錦縣，使進入東北之國軍陷入絕境。</p>

<h3>省制與統一</h3>
<p>— 徐爾信</p>
<p>我國現行政治組織之系統，可分為「中央」「省」「縣」三級，（區署暫不論列）通常以省與縣併稱為地方，以別於中央。其權限之劃分，主張中央集權者，則鑒於過去各省軍閥　兵據地，反抗中央，造成分裂之局面，防碍國家之統一，因介縮小省區之議，藉以削弱省之權力，庶中央政令易於推行，能收指臂相使之效。主張地方分權者，以中央集權，則民主政治無由充分發展，必須實行分省自治，將省之極力提高，以期適合近代民主政治之潮流。意見紛歧，莫衷一是。究竟省之地位，應如何規定，其與中央之權限，應如何劃分明白，極為國內人士所關懐。茲先就我國歷史觀點，詳予剖析。</p>
<p>我國過去政治制度，重視一統之局。秦以前封建時代，有天子以統治諸候，惟諸候之數，將及千萬，非天子一人所可統治。於是黃帝盡野分州，立四監以分治萬國。堯分天下為九州，舜肇十有二州，夏商周之九州，州各有牧，以統牽萬國，分治諸候。自秦廢封建，改設郡縣，以朝廷統治都縣，有鞭長莫及之虞，於是以監察御史巡行郡縣。漢代版圖日廣，郡縣增多，武帝置十三部（亦稱州）刺史，奉詔以六條問事，巡行所部。後漢以名臣為刺史，專州郡之政，並置別駕治中諸曹掾屬，號曰外臺。晋置十九州刺史，權重者使持節，輕者持節假節，三年一入奏。隋以五代割據鼎立，天下分裂，州郡倍於兩漢，乃廢郡以州治民，刺史無刺舉之任，古者以州領郡之制廢。唐於州郡變易無常，設十五道以統郡，初置巡察使，每道二人，後改按察使，道各一人，復改手採訪處置使，又改為觀察使；其邊方有寇我之地，則加旌節，謂之節度使，宋改道為路，分為十五路，所統有府州軍監縣，每路設轉運使並兼按察使一人，一路之事，無所不總，所有邊防盜賊刑訟金榖按廉之任皆委之。省之名稱，始於元之設行中書省十月一，統治府州縣。行中書省者，對中書省而言。中書省雖置於京師，而仍統山東西河北之地，此為由朝廷直接統治州縣之一證明。中書省為政本所自，為中央最高權力機關；行中畫省，為其代行職務之分枝，故亦以平章政事為之首長。明改為十三承宣布政使司，亦稱十三省，直隸者二，以京　地方直隸於戶部，此為由朝廷直接統治州縣之又一證明。後於布政使外，各省別設巡撫，多寡無定，明制，初置十八省，於幾輔亦設布政使司，仍稱直隸，猶漢置十三部，而司隸為其一部，唐置十五道，而京幾亦為一道上這。各省設一巡撫，有守土之責，以京朝官之銜，而兼統民事，數省則設一總督。民國以來，各省先設巡按使，後改為省長，　理憶政，另設督軍，專管軍務，省長為監司，督軍為　帥，本各有其專職，但事實上省長動輒受督軍之牽制，於是造成軍閥割據，內戰不已之局面。</p>
<p>由上所述，可見自漢以迄於清，由朝廷以統馭郡縣，必須設有一中間機構，以為朝廷與州縣間，承轉聯絡之樞紐。而所設之刺史，觀察使，轉運使，平章政事，巡撫等，均以京朝之官吏，出任所領州縣之監司，於其所統治之州縣以內，負有敦　敎化，勸課農業，整治軍旅，察捕姦宄，均平賦役，申理寃濫，疏決囚　，正　官常，振卹災荒，延間疾苦，觀察風俗之不包。一面復將所領州縣情形，入奏朝廷，上達民隱。其黨審之事項，極為廣州；其行使之權責，極為重大。顧以一切票　中央之命，受朝廷之指揮而行使，自非朝廷失職，天下大亂，鮮有割據自雄，妄冀非分者，不可謂非制度之優良。</p>
<p>民初省制失其原意，而軍閥始跋扈，省遂誤被視為地方政府。爾來盛倡民主政治制度，於是有分省地方自治之職，更有主張省有制產權者。政協會協商結果，竟定省為最高自治單位。又有省自制省自治法，在憲軍小組會議亦各有爭論。一若實行民主政治，必須以提高省之地位，擴大省之權限為前提者。不知我國數千年來，均係單一制之國家，「省」並非構成國家之單位，即並非先有若干省而後組成國家者。中國之「省」，與聯邦國家之「邦」，性質絕不相同，未可妄加比擬。省在我國政治史上，其地位乃在介乎朝廷與州縣之間，受朝廷之指揮，行使國家之行政，統領其所屬之州縣，祇可視為中央之外暈或行臺，絕不能視為細碎之地方政治機構，而有其獨立性與特殊性，已如上所舉述。或者以我國過去係專制政治，由朝廷集權，近日各省須實行地方自治，主權在民，情形不同。不知所謂「地方自治」一辭，最初見於晚清預備立　，以實行「地方自治」藉為綏和革命之空氣。地方自治之本意，乃在由官治面改為民治，即地方政事，改由人民自治而已。然人民自治，有其必經之程序，非可一蹴而成。若人民自動組織地方自治政府，以武力與中央相抗衡，此係「革命」，而非「地方自治」也。　國父遺敎之建國大綱，對地方自治曾有下列數項之規定：「一完全自治之縣，共國民享有四種直接民權」「每縣地方自治政府成立之後，得選國民代表一員，以組織代表會，參與中央政事」。「凡一省全數之縣，皆達完全自治者，則為憲政開始時期，國民代表會得遠舉省長為本省自治之監督，至於該省內之國家行政，則省長受中央這指揮」。「縣為自治之單位，省立於中央與縣之間，以政聯絡之效」。又地方自治實行法，其中規定各事項，皆為屬於縣應辦之事。可見地方自治之實行，確應祇以縣為單位，為基礎。其理由：（一）我國所謂牧民治民之機構為縣，改官治為民治，自應從縣開始實行。（二）地方自治之機構如區鄉鎭，均直屬於縣。（三）四種直接民權之行使，惟自治之縣民始得享受。省則為自治之監督機構，同時又為國家行政之執行機構，與歷代之「州」「道」「路」曁元明清之「省」，性質大抵相同，自不能視為純粹之地方自治機構，即不得謂為「自治最高單位」。因之，所謂「地方自治」與「分省自治」，名同而實異。「地方自治」為憲政實施之基礎，民權行使之開端，其重心在縣而不在省，其實施程序則目下而及上限，使與中央抗衡，藉為牽制，無眞正民權之可言，其重心乃在省而不在縣，其責施程序則自上而及下，甚或無程序可言，而係由武力造成這特殊勢力，即不啻借地方自治之名，而行割據地方之實。以「分省自治」始者，必以「聯省自治」之說終，而「聯省自治」，則固為民國十年前後一部分政客反抗國民革命之陰謀也。</p>
<p>至省之權限，在　國父遺敎建國大綱第十條，有明文規定，即「在此時期，中央與省之權限，棌均權制度；凡事有全國一致之性質者，劃歸中央，有因地制宜之性質者，劃歸地方，不偏於中央集權或地方分權」。以我國土地面積之遼闊，民情風俗之各異，中央推行國家政令，於各行政區域內，難期普遍適合，中央自可畀予各省以因地制宜之權。各省祇須不抵觸由央之法令，自得充分行使其權力，並可制定省單行法令。但國防·軍事·外交·司法·金融·幣制各項，均應由中央直接辦理，不容分割與破裂，各省自不得干預。即其他如民政·財趲·敎育·交通·農林·社會等項，其中含有全國一致性者，由中央負責，各省仍得因地制宜，酌予變通。例如：全省戶口之調查，地籍之整理，自治保甲機構之編組，警衛之編訓，賦稅之課征，道路之建築，水利之興修，敎育文人之普及，衛生之提倡，農林漁牧之改進與推廣，救卹之興辦等等，各省自可於不抵觸中央之法令範圍內，督促並領導各縣實施辦理，以謀地方事業之發展。所謂地方權限，應包括縣地方在內。目前縣之權力，受種種之限制，縣事業絕難擴展，自好之士，每多離縣而他去，大有「漢汲　出守淮陽，至於流涕，唐班景倩入為大理，喜若登仙」之槪。中央與地方之權限，應於憲法內用列舉式明白規定，力矯省權過重，頭重脚輕之弊。尤應將省之原有一部分權限，分畀於縣，省事業應力求其縮小，務使縣機構　以擴大，縣財政予以充裕，縣事業儘量予以推廣，以符均權這旨，而使地方自治，建築於縣事業之基礎上，方能眞正符合民主政治之精神，省一面居監督之地位，督促各縣實行地方自治，一面受中央之指揮，忠實執行國家之行政，如此互相密切連緊，領導各縣作向心運動，以擁護中央，則國家之組織嚴密而堅强。</p>
<p>作者以為省制之規定，必須以加强統一，鞏固中央為前果。目前省之面積，固　稍大，但以交通之進步，電訊這發達，已使土地面積無形縮小，中央控制，已見容易。省區縮小，重行劃分，雖亦能减弱省之權力，但糾紛亦多，單位增加，官署林立，中央監督指揮，亦有失其靈敏這患，將有重蹈隋改郡為州覆轍之流弊，使省失去其原來居中任聯絡為樞紐之作用。且使省與省間之富力人口文化交通等，增加其彼此差別之程度，則人才有偏聚之處，地方學業亦難有普遍與平均發展之望。故省之建置，其區域不妨槧仍舊貧，但制度必須依照　國父建國大綱各條這規定，使其地位介乎中央與縣之間為自治之監督，受中央之指揮，執行國家行政。其權限則採均權制，在加强統一，鞏固中央之原則下，因地制宜，以行使其權力。倘有憑藉地方白治之名，行分化運動之實，破壞國家這統一，造成割據之局面，則國家整個力量，固因此而分散減弱，即割據白雄者，彼此亦唯有相　干戈，互相據奪，結果自趨於毀滅敗亡而已。吾中華民族素好和平，人心趨向統一，中國政治制度，亦利於統一，而不利於分裂，統一則治。分裂則亂，殷鑒不遠。凡割地擁兵者，或能維持於一時，但不韓　間，無不自食滅亡之果，史例彰著，不勝枚舉。民國以來，軍閥割據，連雞之勢，固不易摧毀。但國民革命軍由　蔣主席統領師干，分逍北伐，所向被　，次第　清，一統之局已成，人心厭亂望治久矣。今者抗戰勝利，復又請於四强之列，國際地位增高。國父遺敎，一致努力實行地方自治，結束訓政，實施憲政共向統一之涂邁進，使眞正民主政治，得以充分發展。全國各黨各派，尤應排除私見，和衷共濟，一致擁護　蔣主席領導全國，完成建國之大業，使國家永久臻於富强康樂之域。茲以各方對省制意見，出入甚大，爭議頗烈，而於地方自治之意主我，與實行之程序，亦不無誤解。東北問題，所以不能獲得協議結果，即在一方堅持樹立地方自治政府。國民大會雖有星期召開，會期當不在遠，對憲法之制定，省制問題，攸關建國根本，治亂之所緊。自應本諸建國大綱各條之規定，以確立省制維護統一，避免分裂。爰本客觀超然之地位。就我國歷史觀點，並　國父遺敎，對省制與統一，相連關係，貢陳愚見，以就敎於國人。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統下令　接收美全國鐵路　並發表文告籲請路工留職合作　路工如罷工全國經濟將漸呆滯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕美國鐵路工人決定實行總罷工，今日已屆最後限期，如不獲解決，則全國經濟勢將陷於麻痹狀態。工會領袖堅持罷工應按規定時間實行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕杜魯門總統今夜下令接收全國鐵路，以阻止路工明晚九時（上海夏令時間為十九日上午六時）實行罷工。鐵路工會代表於下令前數分鐘離開白宮，據稱：政府如接收鐵路，工會將飭路工退出職位。記者問罷工如期實行乎？鐵路職工交誼會會長費德尼答曰「然」。杜魯門總統並發表文告，籲請路工留職合作。據白宮消息：全國鐵路接收後，將由國防運輸局主持通車事宜。鐵路職工交誼會共有會員二十五萬人，一旦實行罷工，則全國幹綫二十二萬五千餘哩之交通將在於一星期陷於停頓。更以原料及燃料無法運輸，外洋輪船亦將停航，國內重要工廠均將關閉，全國經濟隨之逐漸呆滯，損失之鉅，恐非數月甚至數年不能恢復。</p>
<p>鐵路工潮　影響嚴重</p>
<p>鐵路接收係於罷工前廿四小時即星期五晚九時實行。此次鐵路大罷工係隨汽車製造業，電器製造業，鋼廠銅廠鉛廠及煤礦最近工潮接踵而至，故其影響必見嚴重。煤礦工潮甫於本月十三日起停工十二日，美國工業受其打擊，喘息未定，全國鐵路亦因缺乏煤斤，減少班次。</p>
<p>救濟物品　無法運出</p>
<p>據聯合國善後救濟總署職員稱：鐵路罷工如果實行，則救濟物品更將無法運至碼頭。此項救濟物品原已不足，故未在碼頭堆　有何積儲以便繼續運出，有之惟有少數煤片，以備運往歐洲，惟亦於數日內即可運完，過此亦將斷檔矣。同時據鐵路工會方面稱：罷工令並不影響救護車，運兵車，牛乳車及伊利諾州中央，鐵路五千哩一綫，該綫早已由政府接辦。</p>

<p>〔路透社新德里十八日電〕印督魏菲爾昨廣播稱，本人於茲印度史上最重要之時期，向諸君談話。此次建議書發表之前，曾經過最詳細之研究，余原希望印度領袖能成立協定。此次公布之建議書，顯然與各黨希望不盡相符，吾人今以和年及完全獨之機會獻與印度。國內之飢荒為一嚴重問題，希望在過渡時期，印度政府已能移交於印度之領袖，彼等當為新印度之建築師，此乃世界史上最重大之試騐。故無論英人，回敎徒，印度敎徒，或各邦，均須改變已往之面目，以完成此一試騐。目前介於和平與內亂之間，希望諸君謹愼從事。</p>
<p>英國印事務部　不擬辦理結束</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕印度事務部某官員今日告記者稱，該部不擬立即辦理結束。記者問印度事務大臣，勞倫斯曾在新德里招待記者謂，該部已着手清理，並將與印度制憲之進行保持同一步驟。據答稱，勞倫斯之言，殆指逐漸將權限移交印度，此事進行業已數年。印度事務部職員人數及印度事務　大臣，所担任之工作，業已大為減少。例如關於貿易方面，前由印度事務部執行之工作，現已歸印度供應委員會接收。印度事務部之將來地位，與規定英印兩國關係之最後條約有關，當視印度決定是否仍留在英帝國內而定。</p>
<p>英對印新方案　美方印象良好</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八日電〕代理國長卿艾克遜昨招待記者時稱，英政府關於印度之建議案，予美政府以良好之印象。該項建議全文，尚有待於詳細之研究，惟其中關於立即設立全印行政機構之點，實為解決印度問題最具體之步驟。</p>

<h3>新巿長伉儷飛低　施政方針首重節約　希望全巿巿民發動建設新上海　明晨紀念週舉行新舊交接儀式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大上海精心策劃百萬巿民熱烈期待之新巿長吳國楨氏，昨日下午五時廿五分偕夫人黃卓　女士由京乘一一一號中航機抵滬，吳氏下機後笑容可掬，與錢巿長合留一影後，即登車逕赴百老匯大厦旅邸休憩。昨往機塲歡迎者有錢巿·何副巿長·沈士華·馮有　·趙祖康·羅祖康·羅學濂·汪竹一及先抵滬之新任地政局長祝平，　　　佔置一切之前國際宣傅科長張彼得等百餘人。</p>
<p>吳氏於抵達百老匯大厦十七樓後，即接見本巿記者團，發表談話謂：「本人係民二十六年四月間來滬一次後，迄今已九年未履上海。抵此後，表示其</p>
<p>感想四點：（一）對上海同胞八年間受盡敵人壓迫摧殘，飽宮精神痛苦，表示十二分同情。吳氏謂：吾等在內地生活，雖受手質痛苦，但精神痛苦實校手質更大。（二）此番來滬，對於本巿巿政，首學要做到「節約」一點。吳氏認為中國抗戰艱苦，至今尚在困難中掙扎，公務員當樹立節約風氣。上海為全國第一大都巿，經濟中心，一般水準向較各地為高，故竭盼全巿巿民首先發動，建設新上海，不僅為全國榜樣，且當耀示外人。記者詢以</p>
<p>旋政方針及巿府組織，吳巿長答，施政全須根據實際問題，解決困難必究其癥結所在，空洞感想雖有，但是否切合實際，尚無把握。故對施政方針，一時尚不能報告。至巿府人事更動，巿長表示決將留用各部人員，即辭職官員，若於工作需要，成績優良，亦須以公正態度，挽留堅請為國家服務。吳氏對錢巿長在上海最艱苦時期，服務社會國家，深表欽偑，表示以後施政，尚須與其商酌。公務員</p>
<p>待遇問題乃整個國家問題，　欲談享受，則決不可能，即在英美各國亦不能辦到，故必須節約忍耐，共渡難關，但對於生活水準，無論如何應予維持。否則將無法要做到廉潔清苦守住崗位，此事亦擬於接事後詳細研究。此外如本巿工商業種種危機，亦當設法　除，地方政府應由中央政府協助，但對於中央法令，必須忠實遵　　，巿長　　絕對無此消息。　　之三局將廢止副局長制，其他各局則視工作　簡而定。談話歷三十五分鍍，至六時四十分巿長驅草往謁宋院長，即晚七時半應錢巿長歡宴，並商討巿府</p>
<p>移交接收之步驟及日期。最後記者獲悉，新舊巿長之交替，已決定明日在巿府記念週時舉行，錢巿長並將於移交手續完畢後赴京一行，再由京遄返蘇州故里探視親友。至錢氏新職，外界仍多猜測，惟據巿府某高級人員透露：將在軍事方面担任要職可能性較大。</p>

<h3>澄衷中學創辦人葉澄衷　重立銅像今日揭幕　顧敎育局長主持揭幕典禮</h3>
<p>〔本報專訊〕本市塘山路澄衷中學，由篙師起家之鎭海旅滬鉅商葉澄衷於淸光緒間創設，爲我國第一所獨資創辦之私立學校。該校在抗戰時期，所有校舍被日寇破壞，校具什物，洗刦一空，其創辦人葉澄衷銅像，原建在校內亦被日本浪人私擅他徒，幾於日寇濫徴銅鐵之際，化作兵器。勝利後，該校校舍巳修葺一部分，復校上課而其創辦葉人澄衷銅像，近亦迎歸原址，重行建立，定於今日（十九日）上午十時，舉行揭幕典禮，由市敎育局局長顧的　蒞臨主持。届時該校擬印發葉澄衷傳略及重立銅像記，以資紀念。茲將是項傳記分誌於下：</p>
<p>葉澄衷傳略　「葉澄衷傳略」：葉成忠，字澄衷，浙字鎭海人，世業農。父志禹，母氏洪，兄弟三，成忠居次。六歲而孤，依寡母兄弟居，備嘗　困。九歲，始就熟師讚，未半年，即以家貧輟學，助其母理田事。十四歲，就榮於某肆，年僅得錢千文，主婦遇之無狀，澄衷坦然白若，勤其所事。越二載，母請人說於肆主，謀加年薪之半，主婦聞之，厲聲曰：「以彼之才，所得猶恐過當，是何可哉？」澄衷聆其語，悄然離去，時正年十六也。常是時，南京條約初定，上海闢為商塲，甬人揚帆渡海而至者，月必數起，澄衷旣怏怏歸，拜其母，隨隣人倪，附舟而北。顧資斧無所出，請於舟子曰：「我助若操舟，汝恕吾資，其可乎？」同行者皆曰：「善一越半月，抵上海，佇立浦畔，計無所出。有　人某，設小肆於十六浦，覩狀，詰其故，澄衷具以吿，某嘉其志，因留宿焉。澄衷自揣學固未足，力有可爲，乃日爲人肩荷囊槖，不辭疲勞，饗飱無缺，並積錢以存肆主。主以勤誠可取也，夜則授以算事，期年，積資數千文，謀於肆主，日駕艇販菜果於英艦，廉値守時。艦中人率知其誠，瓜代有期，必以誠走相吿，因是營業鼎盛。其後某艦將校，駕其舟登艦，遺篋於舟，澄衷初未之知，旣抵埠，見遺篋一，知某所失，即　舟待，須臾，某果划舟至，澄衷即奉以篋，某喜甚，探懷酬以金，不受曰：『某不敢得非義之財也。』因是聲譽鵲起，會肆主以老病退休，即授其肆於澄衷，是爲氏經商之始。至同治元年，設順記五金肆於虹口，爲滬上五金業之首創者。西人成知其誠，樂與貿易。卒以勤儉自持，誠信待人，營業日益擴張，不數年，分肆遍設通商各埠。又在滬漢二埠，創設火柴繅絲諸廠，規模宏遠，發軔工商，挽回漏扈，其見其志之深遠也。厥後氏悟積財亦當散財，因是遇有公益，無不慷慨捐輸。晚年，行經虹口張家灣，見羣兒赤足馳逐濱畔，心焉　之，歸謂其友曰：『我少孤貧，常愧大學，今吾見張家灣羣兒之頑嬉，必以無可學也，吾當於是處購地築舍，使羣兒得所學以備社會用，計已決矣，盍助我以戴其事乎？」友曰：「善」。乃共謀購地十八畝有奇，捐銀二十萬兩，鳩工庀材，越二年吿成，即今之澄衷中學也。方經始時，西人福開森，李佳白輩，力阻其成，謂不如仿聶中丞捐地興學例，納資工部局代爲經營，又謂不如設醫院，施診以濟貧民，而氏不移所志，婉辭却之，足見共意志之堅矣。當開學時，忽罹病，授意陽湖在淵若太史，屬爲撰書一聯，懸諸禮堂，文曰：一余以幼孤旅寓申江，自傷老大無成，有類夜行思秉燭」；「今爲童蒙特聞講舍，所望　年志學，一般努力惜分陰。」易簧前，遣書校董樊陳諸君云：「澄衷少孤貧，長悔失學，久欲建立學校以濟貧寒子弟，事方經始，而疾病侵尋，慮先朝露，諸君子相交有素，必能曲體微忱，勉襄是舉，相期桃李成蔭，有以為國也。」其惓惓於學校也如此，可謂忠於國者矣。卒之年，五十有八，淸光緒二十八年，淸督學使者唐景崇知其事，爲之奏請褒獎，並付國史館立傳云。</p>
<p>重立銅像記　「重立銅像記」：像建于民十之夏，為立校周二十之歲，當時董校事者，爲陳瑞海，王海帆，項如松，張琴軒，曹蘭彬，馬叔平，岑廷康，葉雨庵，葉賢剛諸氏。主校政者，上虞曹慕管。作碑記者，諸曁蔣智由。書丹者，崑山余天遂。揭幕者，奉化王正廷。及民二十六之秋，敵寇滬東，校人星散，初吿淪陷，洗刧無遺。翌年四月十二日，寇復糾無賴脫像於基，並十人力肩而過諸市。暹者執以吿校，由校董葉賢剛，校長吳瘁倫，會司淸於官，存諸警局，因校係禁地，無可爲言也。荏苒七載，至三十四年七月，敵濫徴銅鐵，滬東警局敵署長來校，迫余獻像，惶恐無以應，婉詞搪塞。遷延月餘，會寇降期近，得吿無恙。今復迎歸重立，謂非無先校主在天之靈而何？所可憾者，碑記遺稿無存耳。吁，可哀已。中華人民造國之三十五年立校紀念日，校長王</p>

<h3>米價昨又狂漲七八千元　民食問題嚴重化　宋院長指示抑平辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日米市漲風更銳，續見飛　，更秈元米均一致猛漲七八千元之巨，麵粉亦隨之再漲千元，油市亦隨各物上漲，猛加六七千元至八九千元，豆餅跟漲六七百元，黃豆本街爭虧，飛升三四千元，生仁帶起千元，綠豆高貨見升一二千元，中關平平，苞米亦見挺千餘元，惟紅糧平正，麩皮乏交，昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，共四千餘石，其種類及石數如下。</p>
<p>白粳一九九三石，杜秈四七五石，薄稻六六七石，蕪秈一二〇石，早稻八三二石，皖秈一一〇石。</p>
<p>又訊，本市整個民食頃已届最嚴重階段，各檔貨均已猛升至歴所罕見之頂高峯，以致人心惶惶，據悉存儲本市米糧總達一百萬石以上，此等食米，除百分四十散佈於各大小住戶外，其中百分之四十即爲全市各米號之營業米，百分之二十即被各大戶所非法操縱，現部份銀行堆棧均堆有此等食米，並爲時已久，况各路來源迄仍蟬聯於途，故本市米價之頻頻高翔，純係受黑心米奸商非法作祟所致，但當局迄未採取斷然捎置，予以嚴厲制裁，各界引爲遺撼。</p>
<p>宋院長關懷民食</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕行政院院長宋子文氏，以日來米價飛漲，影響民生至鉅，昨晨特召見徐寄廎。劉鴻生。徐學禹等，對於趕運川米東下及採購洋米幷計劃籲請聯總，多與接濟，以充民食，藉謀澈底抑平糧價諸問題，指示甚詳，又接見美軍剩餘物質管理委員會主任佐治臣將軍，有所垂詢，下午五時許，宋院長復接見吳開先，聞談話內容，與消弭本市工潮有關。</p>
<p>社會局飭查囤米</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本埠米糧存底，並不缺乏，且到貨不絕，每日到少亦有五六千包至一二萬包不等，乃近日米價飛漲，顯有奸商從中囤積操縱，希圖不法利益，聞社會局已令飭本市倉庫業同業公會，將各倉庫現存糧食及寄存戶名數量，入倉日期，尅速査明列表具報，以想核辦，一面加强市塲監察，遇有非法交易行爲，立予檢舉法辦云。</p>
<p>〔華東社〕市社會局長吳開先，日前偕同勞働協會理事長朱學範；晋京向中樞當局述職，請示處理港上工潮辦法，事畢於昨晨返滬，華東社記者，特往訪問，探詢吳氏對於米價暴漲之意見，據談，此次米價暴漲，已引起各界人士之迫切注意，本人極爲關懷，欲抑平糧價，必須切實疏通來源，使市塲供應不致失調，吳氏並表示渠本人主張實施食米配給，目下本市保甲制度，業已確立，政府可利用保甲，以低廉價格，配給市民食米，則民食問題，可望解決云云。</p>
<p>特派員晉京請示</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市漲風，昨日再接再厲，記者特往訪糧政處代理特派員汪達人氏，據吿渠昨晨曾爲米糧一再暴漲，往謁市府秘書長何德奎氏，何氏對此事極爲關注。汪氏旋稱中國糧食公司，於近兩日內，業已訂購洋米三批，第一批八千噸，第二批九千六百噸，第三批一百萬袋（每袋六十公斤合一百廿市斤），即可陸續運抵本市。抵滬價約計每市石在三萬五千元間，故對常前米似之在漲，實感費解。在氏定昨晚夜車晋京，對糧食部長徐堪氏，將有所請示云。</p>
<h3>紗綫逐步上海　現貸供應不敷</h3>
<p>昨日紗市突飛猛晉，津帮對紡建出品之日光豐年水月藍鳳等日廠老牌子廿支，有特殊進胃，如廿支日光價自一百十五萬直衝至一直廿三萬，較上日狂升十萬之譜，廿支雙馬因是亦逐步上漲，至一百廿八萬之多，其餘中小型紗因受主不多，只跟漲三二萬，四十二支雙股綫仍極俏利，藍鳳以二百四十五萬新高價收市，現貨供應仍感不敷。</p>
<p>布市受黃金與紗價漲風影響，勢亦激高，紡建公司開售布疋廿六種，又美墨等布十五種。</p>
<p>花市紐約美棉報跌七至十六磅音，計近期美金二七·一五，遠期二七·六二，米歧林現貨二七。七五，本埠現棉交易較暢，民營紗廠如新生大生申新第一廠均有採辦，同業亦有零星交易。</p>
<h3>茶市過程平定</h3>
<p>査紅綠茶州花色，天津帮胃納已較形減遜，而本街店莊及蘇州無錫等地之去化，則十分暢順，惟僅及低擋貨，高莊需要較少，價格過程因吐納保持相埒狀態，是以未見軒經，至於專銷國外之針眉及特抽貢熙，茲據怡和，瑞昌兩洋行消息，如有品質不發生變化者，仍有進意，且聞本市某茶業公司最近又接到菲洲　洛哥來電云，珍眉綠茶目前需要甚亟，惜因種種關係，外銷一時尙難人佳境。</p>
<h3>糖價趨勢略平　棉白廠要求免稅</h3>

<p>呢絨毛織品，昨除派力斯凡立項羽紗呢胖嗶嘰等，略有零銷外，餘無若何活動，標準行情，仍呈明穩喑疲之象，同業人士，對於未來市况，見仁見智，各有不同，看跌者以爲中國現在各地物價較之廿六年平均大都漲至四千倍至一萬倍，國外之美英澳等地，祇漲數百借以及千倍餘，故其呢羢定到價目，遠較申價便宜，加以目前金米風潮，西裝做工昻達十餘万元以至二十餘萬元一套，民衆祇管口食及日常需用尙覺不及，對於半奢侈品之呢絨消化，自多節省，因此預測將後之前途，呢絨運到必充，市價必然在落，吾則銷路斷定必較目前更爲滯狹，但一方面則以爲不必悲觀，因新近所定之貨，花色悉皆不全，定價雖廉，但少直接廠家，洋行轉手坐賺厚利，戰前定貨未有定洋，現在均有定洋，加算四五個月利息成本無形中亦增昻，照今之環境，仍係變化靡定，外匯和稅餉續有調整之可能，裝船及進口未能如昔之標準，生活指數短期內難得減低，本廠生產缺乏而成本增貴，來貨逆料在本年年底內，未必能如理想之大量到埠。</p>

<h3>長春廿九天</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者邵慎之</p>
<p>續昨日本報第一版</p>
<p>記者估計長春是守不住的，除非四平街方面北進的國軍能迅速趕達，可是截止這天為止，在長春只獲得一消息，新一軍隊長春六六·九英里，含混糢糊，不知具體的情形。</p>
<p>防守長者的有第二·第四兩個保安總隊，包括六個團。長春警察有八個分局，一個警察大隊，包括六個中隊，共一千多人。此外從九台方面退過來的吉林省政府兩個警察總隊，約二千餘人。這三部份總共有一萬二千人，這就是全部防守長春兵力。</p>
<p>這裏必須說明一點：保安總隊就是今年初出北平空運而來。過去是偽滿國軍的「鐵石部隊」，曾開入冀東作戰，到八一五日本投降為止。第二總隊長劉德溥是「鐵石部隊」團長，總參謀長王正國是偽滿時上校軍官，曾任偽滿軍事部兵事課長；第四總隊長陳家楨，也是偽滿時團長，總參謀長史縱忠，偽滿時任日本憲兵顧問黑田的翻譯官和憲兵上尉。這些由政府改綸的部隊，已成為反對黨軍事進攻長春的政治宣傳資料。</p>
<p>蘇軍撤退共軍逼進郊區</p>
<p>蘇軍撤退之後，中國人在這裏的課題是什麼？現在情形很清楚：開火。一面蘇軍撤退，一面共軍在郊區逼近。九日有幾千共軍在德惠坐火車南下，到長春北十公里處的米沙子車站下車。後來紀者曾以此事詢問攻長春的共軍司令官，池的答覆是這樣的：「我們從哈爾濱過來，都是步行，到了德惠，看見空東輛，弟兄們就爬上去，逼着司機開的。蘇聯人同我們攪得不好。」十二日效外孟家屯，宋家窪子和機場附近，已經接觸。無論如何，卡爾諾夫一走，一場大戰的序幕是揭開了。我們從火車站出米，竹舟的車子開走了，一輛吉普坐八個人未免過擠，於是借搭張大同的車子合眾社的貝克特，體重在八個人中佔第一位，每天酒杯不離手，他的面貌相似於戈林，因為無聊，當別的四位正和卡爾諾夫等在月台上作散步比賽時，他却鑽到蘇聯人掌櫃的車站餐室中去喝伏特加。一聲道走，我們八個人立刻擠進車子，要到飛機場去看看。大家急於參觀戰爭。</p>
<h3>軟性抗議必須參觀戰爭</h3>
<p>張大同胆小謹慎，說正在打仗，去不得。我們向他提出軟性抗議，說我們本來就是戰地記者，弄得他沒有辦怯。但他認為各人的安全，在處政府官吏地位的他，多少負有責任，頗不放心，可是還是坐着車同我們一起走。</p>
<p>我們毫不知道情况，開車疾馳，老百姓——中國人，日本人都在發呆。他們站在街頭，傾聽遠方槍聲，不知道怎麼一回事。車向西北行，經過興安橋，橋下面是鐵道過處，這裏離開市中心區的大同廣場兩千公尺，要想過橋去的老百姓不能過去了，停住在橋東的興安大路口上，槍聲愈加清晰。</p>
<p>經過守衛橋樑的警察詢問，兩輛汽車繼續前進。結果自然是槍聲愈來愈響，而且聽出遠近的層次來。這時路上　無行人，過橋一千公尺，就到達舊衛生技術所和千早醫院前面，辨明槍聲所在地已經離此不遠，頂多五百公尺。這時前面開來一輛軍用卡，說前面無論如何不能過去了。我們立刻下車步行，惠勒·李普曼·艾伯娜·麥德生跑得最快，排成一排，在馬路中心跑着。慎之和貝克特則治着墻壁走。我們不知道守軍的陣地在什麼地方，只是順着馬路飽，這樣亂鉋，彷彿搜索前進，跑到攻的一方面去是頗有可能性的。</p>
<h3>車子開回流彈嗤嗤直叫</h3>
<p>張大同先生又蚪車子開上來，頗似催促我們回去的意思，真是糟糕透了。我們又趕回來，呌車子趕伙開回去，回頭再向前跑，一顆流彈嗤嗤直呌，大家趕緊矮下半截身子，跑過興安廣場。</p>
<p>從興安廣場到市內中心廣場，自西北到東南，是一條筆直的興安大道，足有四千五百公尺，敷有電車軌道，一直通到西飛機場附近。這個地方十分荒涼，雖然是在市區以內，但還沒有建設完竣，多半是空地，衰草凄迷，加之建築多早破攘，完全是戰場情調，彷彿覺得這裏已經打了三個月的仗。一輛空電車停在廣場北面。</p>
<p>我們六個人還是向前跑，這就找到了守軍的據點「東北紅十字會，在開場過去兩百公尺處，守軍看見我們一羣不速之客，把側門上堆的鐵絲拉開，讓我們進去。守軍在建築物裏面，集在第三層屋頂台上向北面開槍，我們只見滿地是彈壳。</p>
<h3>不辨對象就亂開一陣槍</h3>
<p>這裏是第四總隊的一個連。連長滿面通紅，上兵個個神情緊張，一看就知道都是從未打過仗的脚色。我們個個奇怪因為都沒有看見對面有什麼動靜，</p>
<p>「你們在射擊什麼東西呢？」慎之問。</p>
<p>連長和他的士兵就指手劃脚的告訴大家，前面哪一座哪一座建築物裏躲着人。「我們看他們有幾十個人跑了進去。」</p>
<p>「那麼，你們究竟知這是什麼人呢？」</p>
<p>「不清楚。」</p>
<p>「你們為什麼不派人去查呢？」沒有回答。他們沒有派便衣探，沒有派斥　兵，沒有做搜索工作，沒有情報，甚至沒有一個電話機。一連人孤另另地佔着這一棟建築物，對象還沒有弄清楚就亂開一陣槍，那麼，等到真的打仗的時候，只好沒有聲音了。</p>
<p>看樣子，以這一據點來說，已經裝出一付挨打的樣子了。市區龐大，兵力已分散得可以。我們用望遠鏡東張西望，這樣鼓了三十分點，對方沒有一顆子彈飛過來，這邊士兵熬不住，手癢的時候，就開兩槍，這彷彿說：我們在這裏，有些手足無措。第一回打仗的兵最為荒唐。</p>
<p>事實上，在事後我們擭知確是有少數共軍。飛機場是無論如何不能過去了，正在打。我們於是只得回來。貝克特趕快再到火車站去，買來半打伏特加，幸虧這些東西救了他，否則在以後的日子中，只好上吊了。貝克特和李普曼因為世洵沒有攢到前面去，就和我們大討論其中國人生觀問題。</p>
<p>這天，本來有一次飛機自　陽飛來降落，然後飛哈爾濱，這是與蘇方接洽好的，這也是第一架飛哈的飛機，可是到達長春時，下面正在開火，就一逕飛往哈爾濱。兩小時後又飛回來，這時剛好槍聲暫作，盤旋着陸，長春空軍十四地區司令金恩心，立刻跳上飛機，飛往瀋陽。上一天我們問他到瀋陽去是不是去研究空運軍的事，他說火約是的。飛機剛一起飛，下面又打了起來。共軍用砲彈轟擊飛場和航空站，打到深夜以後，飛機機場的電話就不通了。</p>
<p>好得很，對外交通線是完全斷絕了。孜們和竹舟卓之四人，仍在滿灰大樓，彼此相看一眼，現不禁發笑。意即「等下來吧，現在是莫想離開長春了，空運嗎？也完蛋了。」</p>
<p>今天晚上滿炭大樓的交通部電台遷往中央銀行，發不出消息。滿炭大樓靜悄悄的，槍聲隱隱傳米，西南東三面都在打，真是不亦樂乎。（待續）</p>

<h3>哀切的呼籲</h3>
<p>— 顧仰平</p>
<p>主筆先生：　貴報社論「第三者不能糊塗」和「認清政治僵局癥結」以後，知道貴報因民眾對嚴重的國事，沒有一些注意和反應，抱着非常遺憾和焦灼的態度。人民對國事不加注意，的確是非常危險的事情。可是，可憐的中國民眾，又怎樣來表示他們的不糊塗呢？他們的悲哀和沉痛，是誰也不能測臆到萬一的。假如政黨們肯按受些人民呼籲的話，人民早就不會這樣沉靜了。無論如何，爭奪政權的爭鬥，報復積隙的爭鬥，乃是為私人利害黨派利害的爭鬥，並沒有把人民放在眼裏。中國人民已深深厭惡着黨派和政客。黨爭毀滅了勝利成果，黨爭阻礙了國家建設，黨爭陷落了國際地位，黨爭造成了目前中國的飢饉，農村的破產，經濟的危機，教育的停頓，物價暴漲，投機猖獗等等曠古未有的危　。黨派任意地荼毒着人民，任意地摧殘着國家，眼見這片無數中華男兒用熱血剛剛洗凈的山河，又支離破碎到這個樣子，我們的熱淚，不禁滾滾而下了！</p>
<p>假如貴報肯犧牲一些富貴的篇幅的話，讓我們伸張些最後的呼籲吧！我們看得很清楚，中國共產黨何以會有這樣的聲勢？因為在帝國主義崩潰和資本主義國家捉襟見肘的現時代中，馬克思思想似乎便成了最高的政治理想了。中國共產黨便拿共產主義做幌子，吸引了若干知識份子，文化界，自號前進的青年和貧苦的民眾。同時，中國國民黨自己不爭氣，不肯正視民眾疾苦，不肯下決心澄清史治。當我們聽到一席雞尾酒會可以支持窮民一年以上生活的時候，誰也要妄想去做共產黨了！共產黨便從這樣獲得　大的勢力。當共產黨投機得勢以後，就遺忘了共產主義了。第一，他便要報復和國民黨十八年來的積隙；第二，他要滿足在政治地位上的懲望。在這種如火如荼的情感下，他們自己便也忘却了解放民眾的本旨，他們粉碎了自己標榜的招牌。他們反對一黨專政；但在地們的區域裏，却不容他黨的存在。他們要求言論自由；但在他們的區域裏，却不容異己的言論。他們要求民主；却組織着許多幹部，控制着民眾的行動。他們自稱解放民眾；却有無數呌苦連天的民眾從「解放區」逃出來。他們又說尊重國父；却歪曲三民主義的理論。像這些掛羊頭賣狗肉的事，不勝枚舉。更有可鄙的，他們曾腆顏無恥的播稱東北二百餘處工業設備完好無損，這真呌我們大為駭異！蘇聯已在答覆美國的抗議書中，自承拆運的物資是戰利品，何以還要中國共產黨來硬事遮瞞，掩蔽國家喪失的權益？這種求媚態度，使我們對共產黨的居心，便不敢想像了。我們很懷疑中園共產黨，會變成股汝耕之類的組織的。蘇聯共產黨只知勠力建設，可是中國共產黨僅知努力破壞。蘇聯共產黨力謀國家强固，可是中國共產黨以削弱國力願做附庸為目的。中國共產黨，何苦墮落到如此地步呢？共產黨顯然地暴露了兩點危臉的錯誤；第一，他們以為共產主義捐棄民族觀念，便是做人家的附庸。第二，他們以為共產主義的階級平等，沒有權利義務的觀點，不分皂白，盡十分能力的義務，所獲得的權益，應和盡五分能力的義務一樣。從這裏，我們可以證明共產黨的逞兵掠地，已毫無意義，和明末流寇李自成張獻忠的居心，絕無二致！我們哀切地呼籲，希望中國共產黨，為國家和人民着想，為自己政黨的前途和地位着想，應立即停止掠奪和破壞的行動。假如中國共產黨，會好好地愛護國家，體恤民眾，定能達到政治上的願望的。何以他們只迷信武力，却不信任民眾偉大的力量？</p>
<p>中國國民黨從推翻滿清，完成北伐，到抗戰勝利，在挽救國家和民族的事功上，確已盡了最大的力量，也　最大的貢獻。現在他們又背起建國的重任，他們替國家盡責，我們不忍把地們無端推翻。可是國民黨這幾年來在政治上的頑固，麻木，和滯鈍，也的確引起許多人的不滿。為什麼不肯澈底澄清吏治？為什麼不肯犧牲官僚權貴們的特殊享受和權勢？為什麼不肯正視民眾的疾苦？為什麼不肯安定公教人員的生活？為什麼不肯給失學青年受教育的機會和便利？為什麼不肯真正努力來抑平物價？為什麼僅僅着重都市的點綴，漠視農村的崩潰？為什麼一件公事要「等因奉此」，大兜圈子，大擺架子，而不肯在行政效率上力求改進呢？這樣，不僅造成了共產黨攻擊的藉口，便是人民確也焦灼難忍了。我們哀切地呼籲，希望國民黨，立刻自救救國，用出坦白刷新的新精神來，澈底改善一下政治。我們的立場，是絕對擁護軍隊國有，主權完整，和政令統一的國策，但也同情共產黨的政治理想，反對一黨專政。我們不希望任何方面只用「民主」的招牌來吊我們的胃口，我們只希望大家都能按受我們民眾哀切的呼籲。誰肯接受我們呼籲的，才是真正民主的政黨！顧仰平，五，十六。</p>
<p>連環漫晝三毛從軍記（八）　張樂平作</p>
<h3>東北角的兩雄</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>美國洛衫磯時報特派員最近從瀋陽發出一個電報說：此間國共雙方領袖以私人資格表示，在東北和平實現以前，決定性的軍事行動是不可避免的，此說而果確，則未來的長春爭奪戰，將是中國的兩位最優秀的軍人之間的一幕精采表演。他們的戰績堪和美國歷史上的兩雄格蘭脫與李將軍東西輝映。</p>
<p>優秀兩軍人都是黃埔軍校學生</p>
<p>這兩位優秀的軍人，便是東北國軍總司令杜聿明將軍和共軍總司令林彪將軍。一個是在瀋陽的總司令部裏指揮着各地作戰的國軍，一個是從流動的司令部裏統率着共黨的戰鬥部隊。兩人都是黃埔軍官學校畢業生，杜氏於一九二四年學業，林氏於後一年畢業。</p>
<p>杜聿明將軍機械化戰爭奇才</p>
<p>杜聿明以一九〇三年生於山西省。入伍以後，因作戰有功，由排長晋升至將軍，被譽為中國的機械化戰爭傑出人才。一九三九年，杜氏組織中國的第一機械化部隊陸軍第二百師。一九四二年，他以第五及第六軍司令的資格，偕史蒂威爾將軍同入緬甸，日本投降以後，又同史氏退出緬甸。</p>
<p>杜氏回到中國後，把曾經在緬甸和華南擊潰日軍的中國機械化部隊重新建立起來。他具有軍人氣概，儀表英俊，看上去似乎還不到四十三歲。杜氏心地坦白，和藹可親，雖然在運籌幃幄，戎馬倥惚的當兒，對於來訪的賓客，從不拒絕接見。</p>
<p>不服從命令政府誓必擊破共軍</p>
<p>杜氏對於政府在東北任務的重要性直言無隱。他曾經對記者說：「一國之中，如果有第二種不利於該國的軍隊，那麼這一個國家永遠不會太平。因此不是共產黨必須服從政府的命令，便是政府必須擊破共產軍隊。」</p>
<p>杜氏謂中國和平的最大障碍，便是共產黨的不遵守周恩來和馬歇爾在一月二十五日簽訂的協定，該項協定規定共軍應併入新編的國軍內。</p>
<p>林彪在贛南從事長期遊擊戰爭</p>
<p>林彪是共產黨的最優秀的戰術家，和精强幹練的杜聿明，可說是棋逢敵手。林氏身段肥矮，態度溫和，沈默寡言，外貌上很像一位大學教授。可是，他却負有戰略家和作戰的盛名，甚至政府方面的出版物也稱讚他的功績。</p>
<p>林彪於一九〇近年生於湖北黃安。中學畢業後，於一九二四年進廣東黃埔軍官學校，一九二五年畢業。一九二七年，國共分裂以後，他就投身共產黨軍隊。自一九二七年至二八年間，他隨毛澤東在贛南的山嶺中從事遊擊戰鬥，一直作戰到整個遊擊隊祇賸下不到一百個人。</p>
<p>延安「休養」蓄意計劃東北戰爭</p>
<p>林氏於一九二八年向井崗山長征時，初次表顯了他的特出才幹。翌年，任紅軍第四軍軍長，一九三二年升任紅軍第一軍團司令，那時他祇有二十五歲。一九三七年．他担任第八路軍第一百十五師師長，那時共產黨已聯合國軍共同抗日，在山西北面擊潰日軍一旅，由此而名噪一時。以後還打過許多次勝仗。</p>
<p>據共產黨方面透露：林氏為了休養起見，在中日戰事的後半期，一直住在延安。但是現在看起來，好像他為了東北的戰爭已經埋頭計劃了多年，因為他去年八月間來到東北的時候，便帶來了一批共產黨中優秀的參謀人員，其中不少是心理學專家。共產黨對於作戰心理極為重視，他們認為戰區內人民的感化和軍隊的配備同樣重要。</p>
<p>未來的長春戰事乃是爭取整個東北戰略上控制的重要關鍵。主要的問題在於有空軍支持的杜聿明的美國配備的新一軍，能否壓倒注重精神訓練的林彪的雜色軍隊。（合眾社浴杉磯十五日電）</p>
<h3>羅東小駐</h3>
<p>— 台灣羅東十一日航訊　本報特派員暮雲</p>
<p>在合東蘇澳，記者躭了整整的三天，對當地的民情風俗作了個視察，並赴工礦處接管的水泥工廠和當地特有的炭礦水汽水工廠參觀，十日，我們復搭十一時十八分的火車，三十分鐘內折抵羅東。</p>
<p>羅東介於宜蘭和蘇澳間的一個鎮，全區總人口約四萬餘，有五個鄉鎮，因為是台東物資集散的市場，所以遠較蘇澳為繁榮。過去日本人設有三個旅社，光復後剩了兩家，我們在內地揚中縣人接辦的新華旅社住下了。</p>
<p>森林鐵路　從羅東到土場，敷設有鐵道棧，這被稱為「森林鐵路」，因為從土場步行二小時，便到了檜林的大本營——太平山。該處離羅東五八粁六，山麓是低地熱帶林，而在海拔三·七九七米的南湖大山却有着寒帶林。這裏林野的面積六三·一七七陌，蓄材量針葉樹六·八一〇·八四八，闊葉樹一三·〇五三·六九五，共計一九·八六四·五四三立方米，其蘊積量可能駕科阿里山之上。羅東區現在的採木量每年約檜木八萬石（每石是四千五百斤）雜木十二萬石，假使以目前檜木製品每石五四〇元計算，這數目是相當驚人的。（以前檜木——丸太每石價四〇元，現漲至二六〇元，雜木製造品以前每石價八〇元，現漲到五四〇元）因為森林鐵路一部份被洪水衝毀，到現在沒有修復，益以汽油價格高昂，且告缺貨，運輸大感困難，所以要拓展森林產量，交通綫的恢復，實在不能再緩了。這裏在車站沿綫，堆積了大量的木材，有十多家規模相當大的鋸木廠，在農林處的接管下，在半怠工狀態中開着工。芳干廠被接收了，若干却假借了官方的名義營着個人的事業，這種退潮的現象是使人對林產業前途，抱着非常悲觀。</p>
<p>蕃族反感　太平山上有着兩千多高山族，大部是半開化的蕃族，三十年前日本人費了八九年工夫，用盡種種方法把他們「征服」過來。光復後有一個時期國軍召集志願兵，高山族來了三百多人，因為一些細故，他們竟全部返山了，這個反感，其幕後是否有人支持，很難說明，不過很可以相信的是：留有原始民族性的他們，要是在反感時利用威力壓迫他們，至少在目前是不可能。在高深山裏，貯藏着多少量的檜枝彈藥，一時難於捉摸的。因此，當記者要作太平山行時，當地的友人，竭力阻止我的嘗試，這千古大森林的美景，只有留待日後了</p>
<p>米區糧荒　羅東是一個產米區，數十百里的平野裏，每年種植着兩熟稻，記者路過各處，儘是稻田，現在已快到成熟期，至多還有一個月，可以登場了。</p>
<p>全省現在正鬧着糧荒，在蘇澳更不必說，人們是以甘　作為主要食糧的，而在產區羅東，時價也需五百元一石，（上海二十三斤）普遍地到處發着飢餓的吶喊，這是最堪注意的事實，參議會員提出的台灣鬧米荒，而上海却有台米可買，也沒得到具體的答復。以歷年而論，此間產米，若在豐年，其產量足供本省三年之消耗，現在米區不能自給，不是產米區便是受難了。</p>
<p>作為羅東建設和治安的毒瘤的，就是流氓地痞的勢力，異常囂張，居民是談虎色變的。他們擁有數百個徒弟，懷有利器，蠻不講理，到處橫行肇事。他們勾結了當地的義勇警察隊，强佔日產房屋，任意欺壓平民，區署和警所都引為隱憂。尤其是義勇警隊，幕後被當地的惡棍操縱着，以前有兩百餘人，被國軍解除武裝以後，剩有七八十人，襄助維持地方治安，可是他們的「維持」不被重視的。</p>
<p>區署現拘留着十多個盜匪，有三個犯有十次以上血案的，區署在拘所以外臨時駕設電網，因為他們怕刦監，台北縣警察局迭次催提偵訊，區署却不敢安心地送出去，因為他們相信在解送軍法處以後，說不定會交保或減刑的，萬一這樣做時，當事人以及區署，都將遭殃，而現在本地民眾靡不希望就地正法。這種對上級不信任的作風，也是目前台省特殊化中的特殊現象！</p>

<h3>「陞官圖」的導演法</h3>
<p>— 陶能</p>
<p>「陞官圖」的作者深深地把握住現實，用藝術的手法把它誇大地描寫了來，使這劇的主題非常明顯地表現着，含意也頗深刻。</p>
<p>導演者用「深入淺出」的手法處理了這一個劇，使這劇的內容一點一滴地，毫無遺漏地表揚在觀衆之前。</p>
<p>當大幕給拉起的時候，我們已經看到了一個完全對襯的塲面：後牆正中的門，是從中間推開分向兩邊的。左右臺口各擺着一張雙人沙發。臺中一隻八仙桌，桌的左右各靠着太師椅。燈光分兩邊射來，桌椅的影子就分向兩邊倒去。</p>
<p>之後，景的原則沒有變，形式上是改了樣子。後牆是一個「太平通寶」的錢，錢中的方框成了正中的門。左牆是一具巨大的銀箱，銀箱的門代替了通內室的門。右牆邊掛了一個大燈籠，上面寫着「贜」字。臺口的週圍是一張鈔票的邊，可以看到鈔票邊上的「拾」字。左右臺口的沙發還是存在。以後每幕的變換，只是臺中的道具了。</p>
<p>演員的出塲，導演者也是用對襯的方法。最明顯的一塲，就是接省長回來。演員成雙地由後牆中走進，分向左右站着，然後又這麼地繼續進來。省長一人坐在正中的椅上，餘皆站立兩廂。</p>
<p>另外的一塲：省長和知縣結婚，兩對新人分站左右的小圓臺上讀慶祝詞。</p>
<p>以上兩塲是靜的對襯法，導演者還用動的對襯法來處理舞臺上演員的走動。例如：省長快來了。那五位局長一排站着，聽秘書長的吩咐。當警察來報吿：省長離城四十里的時候，那五位局長一齊回身拿起那萬名傘。當警察第二次來報吿：省長離城只有三十里的時候，五位局長急得走頭無路地，都轉動着手中的傘，一個隔一個地，交叉着來回地走動。立刻使舞台面機械地混亂起來，表示出這羣局長的慌亂和焦急。</p>
<p>導演處理演員的動作也大多是誇大的。如：警察局長把妹妹獻給了知縣後，得意忘形地一路敬禮出去。</p>
<p>馬小姐進進出出時身體的扭動和兩臂的擺動。</p>
<p>開銀箱門時的排隊，一串人的跌倒。</p>
<p>省長光了膀子，穿了紅兜肚坐在中間的太師椅上，一脚蹺起踏在椅上，一手提小茶壺喝茶。</p>
<p>演員的講話也是誇大的。如：侍從收到知縣和各局長金條約時候，以飯館麵店堂倌的口吻喊出：收到金條兩兩根……。</p>
<p>此外，劇中角色的服裝全是誇大的：襯肩高得像駝峯，證章大得像碟子。尤其是財務局長，頭上戴的是元寶，身上穿的是鈔票，兩肩　的口袋是苛捐雜稅。</p>
<p>這劇的演出，是一致地給誇大着，但是沒有一點地方讓我們看出是不調和。甚至化裝也是這樣。這樣方式的演出，在我還是第一次看到，然而我覺得它的演出是成功的！是導演者的成功！是全體演員和後台工作人員的成功！也就是上海劇藝社的成功。</p>
<h3>介紹中電二廠新片　「忠義之家」</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>中電二廠正在拍攝之「忠義之家」，是一部抗戰八年，人民堅信能夠得到最後勝利的敘事片。內容是描寫主人翁華耿齋一門忠義捨身爲國，祖孫三代堅苦卓絕的忠貞情形。</p>
<p>這片由吳永剛編導，重要演員有：劉瓊、秦怡、（秦怡在重慶被譽爲戲劇界四大名旦之一。因演技熟練，舞台外形完美，故擁有相當多的觀衆。）方伯、鄭慧等。佈景設計爲李恩杰。都是重慶和上海兩地的第一流人物。</p>
<p>這劇情是以敵僞控制下的上海作背景。所以在敵僞時期的種種暴行，都有事實記錄。例如：七十六號魔窟中慘無人道的刑具；如：給繫住兩個大姆指吊在樑上；用冷水灌入鼻子，坐電椅等等。</p>
<p>米店是買不到米，市民都到鄉下去買了　着米回來，在通過封鎖綫的時候，給敵人沒收，敲詐，槍殺等等。</p>
<p>軋米的人，在天沒有亮的時候就去排着隊。等到米店開門買米的時候，黃牛黨和僞警串通了去衝散隊伍，自己排在頭裏，買到了米再販賣出去。眞正等米吃的老百姓反而買不到米。</p>
<p>日本人隨意搶人家的東西。漢奸隨意壓榨良善的老百姓。愛國工作者的行動。日本憲兵隊封鎖地段，使封鎖區裏沒有存米的人餓死。我國的飛機轟炸敵人的飛機塲，地下工作者指示投彈目標，與敵兵搏鬥。</p>
<p>這許多都是上海的市民所熟悉的，也是這八年來所身受的痛苦。現在由中央電影攝影塲二廠攝製成影片，是値得我們鄭重地介紹和推薦的！</p>
<p>這部片子在編導吳永剛日夜努力趕製中，已經完成了一半，約下月份可完全成功。不久就可和上海觀衆見面；作勝利復員後，電影界的第一件偉大貢獻！</p>

<h3>梅蘭芳再演營業戲</h3>
<p>— 冀志楓</p>
<p>梅蘭芳三個字在大部份人的腦筋裏，已經成爲一種古代東方美的代表型，而不僅是一個藝人的名字了，我相信許多眞的古代美人未必有他在舞台上所表現的那樣美，而其他以前到世界各國演戲的時候，各國藝術界人士曾一致承認他全身的動作是合於最新的美學原理的。雖然他們不懂得舊劇的唱工，但他在美國表演時，有一天唱完以後，觀衆大受感動，鼓掌不止，只得出塲致謝，啓幕達二十餘次之多，打破全世界歌唱的紀錄，你能說這是偶然的嗎？</p>
<p>梅先生八年來爲了不願在敵僞統治下演戲，受的損失實在太大了，因爲他的負擔相當的重——除了供給三位公子一位小姐求學外，還有許多親戚朋友，也需要他不斷的帮忙，雖然他自奉甚儉，且絕無任何不良嗜好，但這一筆支出，在物價飛漲的戰時，確已相當可觀了。然而這筆支出由那裏來呢？梅先生藝術家的本色，一不會造幾把木手槍去搶人，二不會囤積居奇發國難財，衹有把自己的房地，產業，字畫，古玩，漸次變賣，如今勝利降臨了，而他半生辛苦唱戲得來的一點積蓄也完了。就是不講甚麼發揚國粹，提倡藝術，只爲了解決個人的經濟問題，而以一個年逾五十的老人，還要粉墨登塲，已經是很値得我們同情的了。然而他最近在南京戲院演了一期營業戲，就有人懷疑他要發財了。固然票價最高一萬二千元，最低三千元，平均每天可賣到一千一二百萬，這個數目好像是很可觀的了，但我們仔細算一算，娛樂捐一項已除去一半，而戲院租金每塲要二百萬元，再除去其他演員的戲俸，還有由北平約來的角兒的旅費，以及宣傳費等，還剩多少？我想任何讀者皆可算得出的。以這樣一點收入，實在不能補償他八年來損失的萬分之一，那裏能談到發財，我們只希望他身體健康，能多演上幾次，除作改良戲劇之先導外，對此一代藝人之老境或可稍有補益，不致如許多藝術家到老來還要別人救濟吧。</p>

<h3>三期肺病愈者印送　國產肺病特效藥方</h3>
<p>（按）日前承陜西鳳翔縣警察局長張錫賢寄示治肺特效妙方後，當即送請本欄顧問中醫陳存仁先生愼重研究，茲經陳先生加註按語，認爲此方確有價値，特爲刊出，盼病家試服，至其成效如何，將來仍請讀者作實騐報吿，此在中國醫學上，實創新紀錄也。（編者）</p>
<p>張錫賢君原函</p>
<p>治肺癆病唯一妙方</p>
<p>在河南各西醫院，均以此中方治肺癆，活人無算，傳至西安，亦活人甚多，有元月二十八日及二月二十二日正報登載介紹，（西安名西醫王子緯大夫亦證明此方奇效，渠之友人治愈者數人），雖三期肺病，亦可起死回生，眞妙方也。</p>
<p>桑白皮、明天冬、大生地、大熟地、東阿膠、大麥冬、紅花、杏仁、川貝母、肥知母、甘草、白芍、白芷。</p>
<p>計十三味各一錢，吐血或病重者各二錢，以雞蛋三個，同藥煮熟，剝去蛋壳，用木　　蛋眼數十個，再放藥煮好，先吃蛋，後吃藥，空腹服，早晚皆可。</p>
<p>附經驗所得</p>
<p>（一）雞蛋選用小的新鮮者，藥罐用大一點帶蓋，水放多一點，久煮一下，蓋緊蓋煮。（二）初服時可各二錢，每日一劑，只吃頭煎，迄至病稍愈後，亦可隔一天一服。（三）服藥時間，無何禁忌，男女老幼均可，惟宜清心寡慾，好好修養。（四）不拘多少以迄至病愈爲止，（或數十服百數十服均可），蓋此皆係潤肺、止咳、化痰、補脾、健胃、去污生新之王道聖藥，寗可多吃，即久咳病亦可治好。（五）亦有人吃至九十服時反而咳吐愈多者，切勿怪懼，此正去污生新現象，再續服去，病即漸愈，然亦有人無此現象者。（六）請多印送抄寫送人，功德無量，子孫萬代。</p>
<p>〔陳存仁醫師按〕　貴處交來此方囑爲研究，查此方近時流傳甚廣，其用藥起源，余查閱有關醫書約二十種，均未見此同樣藥方，當係近人流傳騐方。其組織乃「瀉白散、阿膠湯、麥門冬湯」三舊方之混合劑，確係中醫治肺良方；其藥性乃係滋養、補肺、增液、清熱、養血之藥品。患肺癆者常服此方實爲有益無害！依余觀察：大抵慢性肺癆病常服此方，其營養治療價値，在魚肝油鈣劑之上，確有治愈肺癆之可能性！但慢性肺癆症，其程度已越過肺部以外，如兼有喉痺（即喉頭結核）　核痔漏（腺結核）腹瀉（腸結核）之類者，則此方顯屬無效。又急性肺癆症如百日癆（即栗粒性肺結核）之類，此方亦無效騐。因此方僅收慢性滋養之功，凡兼有潮熱骨蒸者，其進行性較爲迅速，則此方無濟於事也。</p>
<p>編輯先生大鑒：肺勞病爲世界人類之公敵，尤爲貧窮之中國人民的大患，患者旣無特效藥以治之，惟有聽其自然，束手待斃而已。故肺癆病之死亡率，日益增高，爲害之大，人盡皆知。第一次世界大戰結束後，人類之死於斯病者，數更倍蓰，誠有談虎色變之槪。今者二次大戰，甫吿結束，大兵之後，必有瘟疫，瘟疫之中，肺癆爲甚。蓋人民之生活益艱，物質益缺，不能攝取適足的營養，不能抵抗疾病的侵襲，輾轉傳染，蔓延至不可收拾。因之各國各地，鑒於第一次大戰之癆病死亡可懼，故有防癆委員會之組成，然旣無特效之藥以資救濟，亦難以收事半功倍之效。茲幸有左述中藥靈方傳世，在豫陝兩省，已活人無算，誠爲患者之唯一救星，又可爲防癆委員會及中西醫士之最大帮助，敢不公諸世人，以利大衆耶？至希貴報諸公大發慈悲，惻隱之心，專欄登載，以廣宣傳，則德被羣黎功德無量矣。幸勿以無關新聞，或以他報已載，而我可不載，而河漢置之也。</p>
<p>本人患肺癆達四年之久，時愈時發，曾數次修養於山林靜地，中西名醫，均經醫治，珍貴藥品藥針，亦皆吃盡注盡，傾家蕩產，得以茍延殘喘，而病實未愈。去年冬日，病又發，吐血傾盂，險狀較前尤厲，醫士束手，醫院不收，嗣由友人傳來此方，即連服之二十餘劑後，便健步如常，五十餘劑後即已康復勝昔，現長鳳翔警局，王君祖揚患此病亦到三期，去年三月，至省立醫院照X光，右肺組織完全破壞，病勢沉重，奄奄待斃，自服用此藥後，數月之久，病已痊愈，後經檢查，已完全復原矣。余等因感已身以往之痛苦，故苦口婆心，廣播此方於世，以濟世人，現西安之治癒者，已達二百餘人，且藥價甚廉，每味二錢一劑，不過三百餘元，尤爲貧寒人士所易服用，何幸如之。</p>

        <h1>1946 - n139</h1>
<h3>Communist Forces in Rehe Launch Offensive: Fierce Fighting on a 200-Li Defense Line</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] Communist forces launched a major offensive in Rehe on the 13th. From Beipiao in the east to Pingquan in the west, spanning 200 kilometers, reports now indicate that Beipiao was captured by the Communist forces on the 15th. Currently, Chaoyang, Lingyuan, and Pingquan along the railway line are under intense attack by the Communist forces, and the railway bridges in that area have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 18th] Starting yesterday, the Communist forces in Rehe, with a massive force of seventeen brigades, launched a full-scale general offensive against the National Army's defense line stretching from Pingquan in the west to Beipiao in the east. As of 12:00 last night, the National Army was still putting up a valiant resistance. This move by the Communist forces is a purely planned action. After the Communist representative from the Chifeng Group of the Executive Headquarters flew to Chengde, government and American personnel were detained by the Communist forces. The Chifeng Airport was also completely destroyed by the Communist forces last week, preventing liaison planes from landing. The Chaoyang Group was also unable to begin work because the Communist representative refused to take office. The joint meeting of various Rehe groups, originally scheduled to be convened in early April, was repeatedly postponed due to disagreements over the location and the Communist side's claim of food shortages. Later, after a three-party resolution, the meeting was scheduled for May 8th, but the Communist side again refused to issue invitations, citing the commander's reluctance to participate, leading to a standstill in the mediation efforts. The Communist forces then seized this opportunity to launch an offensive, attempting to eliminate the main force of the National Army's 13th Army in a short period, occupy the entire territory of Rehe, create a fait accompli, and then seek an opportunity to attack Jin County, placing the National Army entering the Northeast in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] The Communist forces in Rehe are ambushing the National Army everywhere. Now, the Communist forces have mobilized heavy troops, adopting an encirclement tactic against the National Army in Rehe. Beipiao, famous for its coal production, has been garrisoned by the National Army since the Japanese surrender. The Communist forces once attacked on the 14th, massacring over a hundred miners. The National Army garrisoned there put up a desperate resistance but was ultimately overwhelmed due to the vast disparity in numbers. By noon on the 15th, the entire Beipiao was captured by the Communist forces.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Inspects Troops in Shenyang; Sun Liren Flies to Shenyang to Inspect Defense Lines; National Army Recovers Xifeng and Clears the Flanks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Military News: The National Army no longer needs to reinforce the Northeast because the National Army's position on the Shenyang front has been consolidated, and the Communist forces' counterattack on Benxi has failed. It is also reported that Bai Chongxi is scheduled to return to Nanjing within the month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 18th] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi inspected the 207th Division of the Youth Army stationed in Shenyang this morning and, in the afternoon, visited the Tiexi industrial zone accompanied by Director Xiong and others. Also, Sun Liren, Commander of the New First Army, arrived in Pan by special plane from Ping at 11:00 AM on the 18th to pay respects to the senior officer. He is scheduled to travel to the defense line by military plane on the morning of the 19th to inspect the troops' takeover situation.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] After a short period of stalemate, the battle of Sipingjie became active again starting on the 14th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Headquarters of the National Army in Kaiyuan, 18th] The New Sixth Army of the National Army continued to launch an offensive against the Communist forces in the direction of Sipingjie, capturing Xifeng, an important stronghold of the Communist forces fifty miles southeast of Sipingjie, yesterday morning. The New Sixth Army is currently sweeping away the Communist forces threatening the National Army's flanks and consolidating its position in order to directly point towards Changchun. It is reported that Xifeng is an important town along the railway line and was occupied by the Chinese Communist forces after the Soviet army withdrew on March 13th of this year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] Reports state that National Army generals held a military conference in Shenyang to discuss the Northeast war situation. The generals attending the meeting included Xiong Shihao, Du Yuming, Mou Tingfang, Liang Huasheng, and five army commanders. According to Army Commander Mou Tingjiu, Sipingjie will soon be recovered. Commander Du Yuming stated that the main force of the National Army has advanced into the area north of Sipingjie, but has not entered the city to avoid bloodshed among the people. It is also learned that the Communist forces have built strong steel and concrete fortifications near Sipingjie to block the National Army's advance.</p>
<h3>Group Conducts Mediation; Restore Yongnian Transportation; Dongming Under Heavy Attack, Situation Critical</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] Representatives from the Yongnian Executive Group and UNRRA inspectors, including Guo Landun, went from Handan to Yongnian on the 15th to investigate the truth of the Communist forces' siege of the city, and organized a relief committee to restore traffic in and out of the city, allowing people in the city to enter and leave freely and conduct trade.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th] Since the establishment of the Dongming Agreement, the Communist forces have not complied. Recently, they have mobilized heavy troops again, launching a fierce pincer attack on the National Army inside the city from Mancheng in the south of the city and Wulipu in the north of the city, making the Dongming issue increasingly critical. The Xinxiang Group subgroup that went to eastern Henan to investigate arrived in Bian on the 16th and, at the request of the government representative, changed its route to Dongming on the 17th to conduct investigations.</p>
<h3>Wang Pengsheng Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Wang Pengsheng passed away on the 18th due to complications from asthma. After the victory, he served as an advisor to the delegation of our Allied Headquarters in Tokyo. He had only recently returned to the country from Japan when he suddenly succumbed to a severe asthma attack. Chairman Chiang was deeply saddened upon hearing the news and sent personnel to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Wang Pengsheng, Director of the Institute of International Affairs, passed away in Nanjing at 4:00 AM yesterday due to high blood pressure. The key staff members of the institute who remained in Shanghai mostly went to Nanjing yesterday morning. It is reported that Mr. Wang had been ill in Shanghai some days prior, and his illness was quite severe. After recovering, his friends advised him not to travel further, but Mr. Wang ultimately prioritized national affairs and still flew to Beiping. He returned to Nanjing from Beiping on the evening of the 16th, only to pass away after residing in the capital for just two days. Mr. Wang was a rare expert on Japanese issues in our country, and the Institute of International Affairs, which he presided over, made especially significant contributions during the War of Resistance. Mr. Wang was highly valued by Chairman Chiang during his lifetime.</p>
<h3>Capital City Field Reporters Establish Association; Yu Youren and Shao Lizi Personally Guide</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Capital City Field Reporters Association held its inaugural meeting at the Xiangpu Camp Community Recreation Center at 2:00 PM on the 18th. One hundred and thirty-eight members attended, including reporters from various newspapers, news agencies, and out-of-town newspapers stationed in Beijing.

<h3>Communist Forces Attempt to Engulf North China; Foreign Military Expert Arrives in Beijing to Speak</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] According to a certain foreign military expert who recently came to Nanjing from North China, the current actions of the Communist forces along the Beining Line, the northern section of the Jinpu Line, the northern section of the Pinghan Line, near Qingdao on the Jiaoji Line, and in various parts of southern Hebei clearly aim to: (1) Coordinate with the Communist forces in the Northeast to contain the National Army's reinforcements to the Northeast; (2) Consolidate the new base area of Hebei-Chahar and expand the outer strength of Zhangjiakou; (3) Expand the occupied areas to store food and expand the army, preparing to engulf North China; (4) Use offensive operations instead of defense, flaunting its military power at home and abroad; (5) Use active strategy to cover up its rigid political strategy. At present, due to the destruction of railways and the lack of ships for sea transport, North China's provinces are isolated from the north and south, exhibiting symptoms of paralysis. At this time of year, when the old grain is gone and the new grain is not yet available, food shortages have become a widespread phenomenon, and it is unbearable to suffer from war again. The Chinese Communist Party proclaims "democracy" and "freedom" but its actual actions drive the masters it claims to save into the dire straits of "famine" and "death."

Mr. Fraser stated that he was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet with a large number of Chinese people throughout China, and was therefore very admired by the Chinese people, and that the greatness of the Chinese cultural tradition was even more admired by him. Mr. Fraser continued that, in addition to the general tasks undertaken by the occupying forces in Japan, Britain is doing its utmost to provide China with all kinds of assistance in accordance with China's requirements.

<p>Establish Inspection Office to Maintain Shipping</p>
<p>The Second Water Police District authorities previously intended to work with the 145th Division of the garrison and the Military Police Corps to organize an inspection office to implement inspection tasks in order to prevent bandits from looting ships and maintain water traffic and to eliminate criminals. However, due to the large number of wharves operated by various shipping companies and the limited number of personnel, it was impossible to allocate manpower, so it was difficult to implement at that time. Now, the Shipping Industry Association believes that the lack of safety in shipping greatly affects business. After discussion by the association, it was decided to establish limited and fixed wharves in each key area along the shipping routes and to establish inspection offices at the wharves in Qixu and Liangmen to allow military police to send personnel to inspect.</p>

<h3>Provincial System and Unification</h3>
<p>— Xu Erxin</p>
<p>The current system of political organization in our country can be divided into three levels: "central," "provincial," and "county" (district offices are not included for the time being). Generally, provinces and counties are jointly referred to as local governments, to distinguish them from the central government. Regarding the division of powers, those who advocate centralism, mindful of the past when provincial warlords occupied territory and opposed the central government, creating a divided situation and hindering national unification, propose reducing the size of provinces in order to weaken their power, so that central government policies can be easily implemented and achieve the effect of limbs obeying the head. Those who advocate decentralization believe that centralism prevents the full development of democratic politics, and it is necessary to implement provincial autonomy, vigorously enhancing the power of provinces in order to adapt to the trend of modern democratic politics. Opinions are divided and no consensus has been reached. How should the position of provinces be defined, and how should their powers be clearly divided from those of the central government? This is a matter of great concern to people in the country. Here, I will first provide a detailed analysis from a historical perspective of our country.</p>
<p>Our country's past political system valued a unified structure. Before the Qin Dynasty, during the feudal era, the Son of Heaven ruled the various feudal lords. However, the number of feudal lords was close to ten thousand, which was beyond the capacity of the Son of Heaven to rule alone. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor divided the wilderness into provinces and established four supervisors to govern the myriad states separately. Yao divided the world into nine provinces, and Shun initiated twelve provinces. The nine provinces of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties each had a governor to oversee the myriad states and separately govern the feudal lords. Since the Qin Dynasty abolished the feudal system and established prefectures and counties, the imperial court ruled the counties directly. Fearing that its reach would be insufficient, it sent supervisory censors to inspect the prefectures and counties. During the Han Dynasty, as the territory expanded daily and the number of prefectures and counties increased, Emperor Wu established thirteen departments (also called provinces) with commissioners who, according to imperial edict, asked about affairs based on six articles and inspected their respective departments. In the Later Han Dynasty, famous officials were appointed as commissioners, managing the affairs of the provinces and prefectures, and they were also given separate adjutants and subordinates, known as the Outer Bureau. The Jin Dynasty established nineteen provincial commissioners. Those with great power were granted imperial insignia; those with less power were granted temporary or delegated insignia, and they were required to report to the capital every three years. During the Sui Dynasty, due to the division and fragmentation of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the number of prefectures and counties doubled compared to the Han Dynasty. Therefore, the prefectures were abolished, and the provinces governed the people. The commissioners no longer had the responsibility of impeachment. The ancient system of provinces leading prefectures was abolished. During the Tang Dynasty, the changes to prefectures and counties were frequent. Fifteen circuits were established to govern the prefectures. Initially, patrol envoys were appointed, two for each circuit. Later, they were changed to investigation envoys, one for each circuit, then changed to collection and disposition envoys, and finally to observation envoys. In border areas with enemy incursions, they were given ceremonial insignia and were called military commissioners. The Song Dynasty changed circuits to routes, dividing the country into fifteen routes. Each route included prefectures, states, garrisons, and counties. Each route had a transportation commissioner who also served as an investigation commissioner. They were responsible for everything in the route, including border defense, bandits, criminal lawsuits, finances, and inspections. The name "province" originated from the establishment of the Branch Secretariat in the Yuan Dynasty, which governed prefectures, states, and counties. The Branch Secretariat was relative to the Central Secretariat. Although the Central Secretariat was located in the capital, it still governed the lands of Shandong, Shanxi, and Hebei, which is proof that the imperial court directly governed prefectures and counties. The Central Secretariat was the source of political power and the highest authority in the central government; the Branch Secretariat was a branch that performed its duties on its behalf, so it was also headed by a director of political affairs. The Ming Dynasty changed it to thirteen provincial administration commissions, also called thirteen provinces. Two were directly governed, with the capital area directly under the Ministry of Revenue. This is further proof that the imperial court directly governed prefectures and counties. Later, in addition to the administration commissioners, separate governors were established in each province, with varying numbers. According to the Ming system, initially there were eighteen provinces, and administration commissions were also established in the capital area, still called directly governed, just as the Han Dynasty established thirteen departments, with the Capital Region being one of them, and the Tang Dynasty established fifteen circuits, with the capital area also being one of them. Each province had a governor responsible for defending the territory, holding the title of a capital official and concurrently managing civil affairs. Several provinces were governed by a governor-general. Since the founding of the Republic of China, each province first established a circuit commissioner, later changed to governor, managing administrative affairs, and a separate military governor was established to manage military affairs. The governor was a supervisor, and the military governor was a commander, each with their own specific duties. But in reality, the governor was often constrained by the military governor, leading to warlord separatism and endless civil wars.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that from the Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, in order for the imperial court to govern the prefectures and counties, it was necessary to establish an intermediate organization to serve as a hub for connecting the imperial court and the prefectures and counties. The commissioners, observation envoys, transportation commissioners, directors of political affairs, and governors who were appointed were all officials from the capital, serving as supervisors of the prefectures and counties under their jurisdiction. Within the prefectures and counties they governed, they were responsible for promoting education and culture, encouraging agriculture, managing the military, investigating and arresting criminals, equalizing taxes, redressing grievances, reviewing prison cases, correcting official conduct, providing disaster relief, alleviating the suffering of the people, and observing customs. On the other hand, they also reported the situation of the prefectures and counties under their jurisdiction to the imperial court, conveying the people's concerns. The matters they handled were extremely broad, and the powers and responsibilities they exercised were extremely important. However, everything was based on the orders of the central government and carried out under the command of the imperial court. Unless the imperial court lost its authority and the country was in great chaos, there were few cases of separatism and unwarranted ambition. This cannot but be considered an excellent system.</p>
<p>In the early Republic, the provincial system lost its original meaning, and the warlords began to act arbitrarily. Provinces were mistakenly regarded as local governments. Since then, there has been a strong advocacy for a democratic political system, leading to the idea of provincial local autonomy, and even the proposal that provinces should have property rights. As a result of consultations at the Political Consultative Conference, provinces were designated as the highest level of autonomous units. There were also provinces that formulated their own provincial autonomy laws, and there were disputes in the constitutional army small group meetings. It seems as if the implementation of democratic politics must be based on enhancing the status of provinces and expanding their powers. It is not known that for thousands of years, our country has been a unitary state, and "provinces" are not the units that constitute the country, meaning that the country was not formed after there were several provinces. The "provinces" of China are fundamentally different in nature from the "states" of a federal country and cannot be compared arbitrarily. In the political history of our country, the position of provinces has been between the imperial court and the prefectures and counties, subject to the command of the imperial court, exercising the administration of the state, and leading the prefectures and counties under its jurisdiction. It can only be regarded as an outer arm or a mobile platform of the central government, and cannot be regarded as a fragmented local political organization with its own independence and particularity, as mentioned above. Perhaps it is argued that in the past our country was an autocratic political system with centralized power by the imperial court, and now the provinces must implement local autonomy, with sovereignty residing in the people, and the situation is different. It is not known that the term "local autonomy" was first seen in the late Qing Dynasty's preparation for constitutionalism, using the implementation of "local autonomy" to appease the revolutionary atmosphere. The original meaning of local autonomy was to change from governance by officials to governance by the people, that is, local political affairs would be governed by the people themselves. However, people's self-governance has its necessary procedures and cannot be achieved overnight. If the people automatically organize local autonomous governments and use force to confront the central government, this is "revolution," not "local autonomy." Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction contained the following provisions on local autonomy: "A fully autonomous county shall have its citizens enjoy four direct civil rights." "After the establishment of each county's local autonomous government, one national representative may be elected to organize a representative assembly to participate in central political affairs." "When all the counties in a province have achieved full autonomy, it shall be the beginning of the constitutional era, and the national representative assembly may elect a governor as the supervisor of the province's autonomy. As for the state administration within the province, the governor shall be subject to the command of the central government." "The county is the unit of autonomy, and the province stands between the central government and the county, acting as a political liaison." Moreover, the local autonomy implementation law stipulates that all matters are the responsibility of the county. It can be seen that the implementation of local autonomy should indeed only take the county as the unit and the foundation. The reasons are: (1) The institution for governing the people in our country is the county, and changing governance by officials to governance by the people should start from the county. (2) The institutions of local autonomy, such as districts, townships, and towns, are directly subordinate to the county. (3) Only the citizens of an autonomous county can enjoy the exercise of the four direct civil rights. The province is both a supervisory institution for autonomy and an executive institution for state administration, with a nature largely similar to the "states," "circuits," and "routes" of past dynasties, as well as the "provinces" of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It cannot be regarded as a purely local autonomous institution, meaning it cannot be called the "highest autonomous unit." Therefore, the so-called "local autonomy" and "provincial autonomy" are the same in name but different in reality. "Local autonomy" is the foundation for the implementation of constitutionalism and the beginning of the exercise of civil rights. Its focus is on the county, not the province. Its implementation procedure is from the bottom up to the upper limit, using it to confront the central government as a check and balance, and there is no real civil rights to speak of. Its focus is on the province, not the county. Its implementation procedure is from the top down, or even without any procedure at all, and is created by a special force, which is no less than using the name of local autonomy to carry out the reality of local separatism. What begins with "provincial autonomy" will inevitably end with the theory of "federal provincial autonomy," and "federal provincial autonomy" was originally a conspiracy by some politicians around 1920 to resist the National Revolution.</p>
<p>As for the powers of the province, Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, Article 10, clearly stipulates that "During this period, the powers of the central government and the provinces shall adopt a system of balanced powers. Matters of a national nature shall be assigned to the central government, and matters of a locally appropriate nature shall be assigned to the local governments, without favoring either centralism or decentralization." Given the vast land area of our country and the differences in customs and practices, it is difficult for the central government to ensure that its national policies are universally suitable within each administrative region. The central government can naturally grant the provinces the power to adapt to local conditions. As long as the provinces do not violate the laws and regulations of the central government, they can fully exercise their powers and can also formulate provincial individual laws. However, national defense, military affairs, diplomacy, judiciary, finance, and monetary systems should all be directly handled by the central government, without allowing division or fragmentation, and the provinces shall not interfere. Even in other areas such as civil administration, finance, education, transportation, agriculture and forestry, and society, those aspects that are of a national nature shall be the responsibility of the central government, and the provinces may still adapt to local conditions and make appropriate changes. For example, the investigation of the population of the entire province, the reorganization of land registration, the organization of autonomous baojia institutions, the organization and training of guards, the collection of taxes, the construction of roads, the construction of water conservancy projects, the popularization of education and literacy, the promotion of sanitation, the improvement and promotion of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and animal husbandry, and the establishment of relief efforts, etc., the provinces can, within the scope of not violating the central government's laws and regulations, supervise and lead the counties to implement them in order to promote the development of local undertakings. The so-called local powers should include the county level. At present, the powers of the county are subject to various restrictions, and county undertakings are extremely difficult to expand. Men of talent often leave the county for other places, much like "Han Ji wept when he was sent to govern Huaiyang, and Tang Ban Jingqian was overjoyed to be appointed to the Dali Temple." The powers of the central government and the local governments should be clearly stipulated in the constitution in a list format, to correct the malady of excessive provincial power and being top-heavy. In particular, a portion of the original powers of the province should be distributed to the county, the province's undertakings should be minimized, the county's institutions should be expanded, the county's finances should be enriched, and the county's undertakings should be promoted as much as possible, in order to comply with the principle of balanced power and to make local autonomy based on the foundation of county undertakings. Only in this way can it truly conform to the spirit of democratic politics. The province, on the one hand, occupies the position of supervisor, supervising the counties to implement local autonomy, and on the other hand, is subject to the command of the central government, faithfully executing the state's administration. In this way, they are closely linked, leading the counties to move towards the center to support the central government, so that the organization of the country is tight and strong.</p>
<p>The author believes that the provisions of the provincial system must be based on strengthening unification and consolidating the central government. At present, the area of ​​the provinces is indeed slightly larger, but with the advancement of transportation and the development of telecommunications, the land area has invisibly shrunk, and central control has become easier. Reducing the size of provinces and re-dividing them can indeed weaken the power of the provinces, but there are also many disputes. With the increase in units and the establishment of official offices, the central government's supervision and command may also lose its agility, which will have the drawbacks of repeating the mistakes of the Sui Dynasty's change of prefectures to states, causing the province to lose its original function of being a hub for communication. And increasing the degree of difference between the provinces in terms of wealth, population, culture, transportation, etc., will result in talents being concentrated in certain places, and it will be difficult for local education to develop universally and evenly. Therefore, the establishment of provinces, their regions may as well remain the same, but the system must be in accordance with the provisions of Sun Yat-sen's Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, so that its position is between the central government and the county as the supervisor of autonomy, subject to the command of the central government, and executing the state administration. Its powers adopt a balanced power system, and under the principle of strengthening unification and consolidating the central government, adapt to local conditions to exercise its powers. If there are those who, under the guise of local autonomy, carry out separatist movements, undermine the unity of the country, and create a situation of separatism, then the entire strength of the country will be dispersed and weakened as a result, and even those who are separatists will only be able to fight each other and seize each other, and the result will inevitably lead to destruction and defeat. Our Chinese nation has always loved peace, and the people's hearts are inclined to unification. The Chinese political system is also conducive to unification and not to division. Unification leads to order, and division leads to chaos. The lessons of the past are not far away. All those who seize land and possess soldiers may be able to maintain themselves for a time, but sooner or later, they will inevitably reap the consequences of their own destruction. Historical examples are clear and numerous. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the warlords have been divided and the situation has been difficult to destroy. However, the National Revolutionary Army, led by Chairman Chiang, divided and conquered the north, and they were unstoppable. They gradually cleared away the separatist forces, and the situation of unification has been achieved. The people have long been tired of chaos and hope for order. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and we have once again been invited to join the ranks of the four great powers, our international status has increased. [We should] work together to implement Sun Yat-sen's teachings, strive to implement local autonomy, end the period of political tutelage, implement constitutionalism, and move towards unification, so that true democratic politics can be fully developed. All parties and factions in the country should put aside their personal prejudices, work together in harmony, and unanimously support Chairman Chiang in leading the country to complete the great cause of national reconstruction, so that the country can permanently achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. Because the opinions on the provincial system from all parties vary greatly and the disputes are quite fierce, and there are misunderstandings about the meaning of local autonomy and the procedures for its implementation. The reason why the Northeast issue has not been able to reach an agreement is that one party insists on establishing a local autonomous government. Although the National Assembly will be convened next week, the session is not far away. The formulation of the constitution and the provincial system are closely related to the fundamental foundation of national reconstruction and the key to order and chaos. [We] should be based on the provisions of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction to establish the provincial system, maintain unity, and avoid division. Therefore, based on an objective and detached position, from the historical perspective of our country and Sun Yat-sen's teachings, regarding the relationship between the provincial system and unification, I offer my humble opinions for the education of the people of the country.</p>

<h3>"It's Too Late" Can't Be the Reason: The Soviet Union Rejects Cooperation in Saving the Famine; Truman Believes the Soviet Response Is Not Without Room for Consultation; Britain and the United States Say They Have Tried Their Best But Still Have Not Been Able to Relieve the Famine</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 18th] An unnamed official claimed last night that President Truman's appeal to Soviet Marshal Stalin to cooperate with Britain and the United States to jointly relieve the world famine has been rejected, on the grounds that "it's too late." It is said that the Soviet response stated that the amount of relief food previously allocated by the Soviet Union has made it impossible for them to comply with the President's appeal now. According to unofficial sources, President Truman believes that the Soviet response is not without room for consultation and is continuing to pursue the matter, hoping that the Soviet Union will assist in solving the food problem. Britain and the United States have jointly issued a statement stating that despite their best efforts, the world famine has not been relieved. The United States government has inspected items imported into Japan to prevent various necessities from being enjoyed preferentially by the Japanese, as these necessities should be given to the United Nations and the people of the liberated areas.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] It has been confirmed here that Britain has not, as President Truman did, urged the Soviet Union to assist in providing food to Europe.</p>
<h3>Hoover Broadcasts to the World, Appealing for 800 Million Starving People, Hoping That Countries Will Cooperate to Overcome This Crisis; Britain and the United States Agree on a General Agreement for Famine Relief</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Chicago, 17th] Former US President Hoover tonight broadcast his report on his 35,000-mile journey to investigate the world food situation, emphasizing that the food crisis is still developing and that the world must work together to overcome this crisis, which concerns the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Hoover stated briefly that one-third of the world's population, over 800 million people, are threatened by famine. What we need most today is unity and cooperation to overcome this crisis. I may as well repeat what I said in Cairo three weeks ago: if every source of supply can do its utmost, relieving human life is more important than the economic needs of world reconstruction. Relieving human life is the only way to achieve order, stability, and peace. This action is a sign of the light of mercy turning to the earth, and it is a sign of the moral construction of the world. President Truman discussed with him the preparation to go to South America to guide South American countries to make more contributions to the food relief program for Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] The State Department announced tonight that Britain and the United States have completed an agreement on the main principles for solving the world food crisis. The Anglo-American joint agreement warns that the threat of famine will continue to exist until at least next summer, and states, "The British and American governments have agreed that more vigorous measures must be taken worldwide to ensure that the threat of world famine is completely lifted."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] British Lord Privy Seal Morrison told reporters yesterday that Britain has agreed to allocate 200,000 tons of wheat by the end of September to relieve the world famine. When asked by reporters whether this would lead to the implementation of bread rationing, Morrison replied that it was difficult to say, but the British government would do its best to encourage people to conserve food consumption. Morrison also revealed that he had agreed with the US authorities on a general agreement for famine relief, as well as the rationing standards in the British and American occupied zones of Germany. Although the details have not yet been agreed upon, he hopes that the crisis in the British military zone can be avoided. [He] requested [for] supplies to India, but the seven-system system will not be interrupted before the end of June. Morrison finally said that he had reached a temporary agreement on the amount of wheat given to Japan, in principle, the grain imported into Japan is limited to what is sufficient to prevent turmoil.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] British Lord Privy Seal Morrison has completed his visit to the United States and will depart this afternoon for Ottawa, Canada.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The World Food and Agriculture Organization will meet in Washington next week. The British delegation, led by Ms. Somerset, Secretary of the Ministry of Food, is scheduled to depart on May 22nd.</p>

<h3>President Truman Orders Federal Takeover of U.S. Railroads, Issues Appeal to Rail Workers for Continued Service and Cooperation; Nationwide Economic Stagnation Imminent if Workers Strike</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th dispatch] American railway workers have decided to implement a general strike, the deadline for which has arrived today. If no solution is reached, the national economy is poised to be paralyzed. Union leaders insist that the strike should be carried out as scheduled.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] President Truman ordered the federal takeover of all U.S. railroads tonight in order to prevent a rail worker strike scheduled for 9 p.m. tomorrow (6 a.m. Shanghai Summer Time on the 19th). Representatives of the railway unions left the White House minutes before the order. It is said that if the government takes over the railroads, the unions will order rail workers to leave their posts. When asked by reporters if the strike would proceed as scheduled, Fred N. Aten, president of the Railroad Employees' Department of the Railway Labor Executives Association, replied, "Yes." President Truman also issued a statement appealing to rail workers to remain in their posts and cooperate. According to White House sources, after the national railroad takeover, the Office of Defense Transportation will oversee traffic operations. The Railroad Employees' Department has 250,000 members. Once a strike is implemented, traffic on over 225,000 miles of trunk lines across the country will come to a standstill within a week. Furthermore, as raw materials and fuel cannot be transported, ocean-going ships will also be suspended, major domestic factories will be closed, and the national economy will gradually stagnate. The extent of the losses may take months or even years to recover.</p>
<p>Serious Impact of Railroad Labor Dispute</p>
<p>The railroad takeover will be implemented 24 hours before the strike, i.e., at 9 p.m. on Friday. This major railroad strike follows closely on the heels of recent labor disputes in the automobile manufacturing, electrical manufacturing, steel, copper, lead, and coal mining industries; hence its impact is bound to be severe. The coal miners' strike, which only ended on the 13th of this month after a 12-day work stoppage, has dealt a blow to American industry. The national railway system is also reducing train service due to a lack of coal.</p>
<p>Relief Supplies Cannot Be Shipped Out</p>
<p>According to United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) officials, if the railroad strike is implemented, relief supplies will be even more difficult to transport to the docks. These relief supplies were already insufficient, so there are no stockpiles at the docks for continued shipment. There are only a few coal briquettes, intended for shipment to Europe, which will be exhausted within a few days, after which there will also be a supply interruption. Meanwhile, according to the railroad unions, the strike order will not affect ambulances, troop trains, milk trucks, or the Illinois Central Railroad's 5,000-mile line, which has already been taken over by the government.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Urges Indians to Accept British Proposals, Seize the Opportunity to Alleviate Suffering; Viceroy Hopes for Early Realization of a Free India</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th broadcast: The Indian National Congress has indicated its acceptance of the proposals put forward by the British, and the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, will also formally respond to the British government tomorrow. The situation in India is expected to improve.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 18th dispatch] Gandhi urged the Indian people in his evening prayer meeting last night to accept the British Cabinet Mission's proposals for a "unified India" in order to sow the seeds of alleviating worries and suffering. He said that some people believe that the British cannot act in a regular manner, but he did not think so. The British Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy, like us, are God-fearing people. If we doubt them before they fulfill their words, we will lose our dignity.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 18th dispatch] Viceroy Wavell said in a broadcast yesterday that he was speaking to the people at the most important time in the history of India. The proposals were published after the most detailed study. He had hoped that Indian leaders could reach an agreement. The published proposals clearly do not fully meet the wishes of all parties. We are now offering India an opportunity for peace and complete independence. The domestic famine is a serious problem. He hopes that during the transition period, the Indian government will be handed over to Indian leaders, who will be the architects of a new India. This is the most important experiment in world history. Therefore, whether British, Muslims, Hindus, or the states, all must change their past faces to complete this experiment. We are currently between peace and internal strife; he hopes that everyone will act prudently.</p>
<p>British India Office Not Planning to Close</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th dispatch] An official of the India Office told reporters today that the department does not plan to close down immediately. When asked if the Secretary of State for India, Lord Pethick-Lawrence, had told reporters in New Delhi that the department had begun to clear up and would keep pace with the progress of Indian constitutionalism, the answer was that Lawrence's words meant a gradual transfer of power to India, which had been going on for several years. The number of staff in the India Office and the work undertaken by the Secretary of State for India have been greatly reduced. For example, in the area of trade, the work previously carried out by the India Office has now been taken over by the Indian Supply Committee. The future status of the India Office is related to the final treaty governing British-Indian relations and will depend on whether India decides to remain within the British Empire.</p>
<p>The U.S. Has a Good Impression of Britain's New Plan for India</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Dean Acheson told reporters yesterday that the U.S. government has a good impression of the British government's proposals regarding India. The full text of the proposals still needs to be studied in detail, but the point about immediately establishing an all-India administrative body is the most concrete step towards solving the Indian problem.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower, En Route Home, Announces Results of Inspection, Says Cities in China Show Little Sign of War Damage</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Honolulu, 17th dispatch] U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower, after inspecting U.S. military defenses in the Pacific, stopped here today for a brief rest en route home and announced the results of his inspection: The U.S. military is very strong, and the military strength in the Pacific, which had once declined due to overly rapid demobilization, is now on an upward trend. The work of new soldiers is gradually becoming effective. Nanking, Shanghai, and other cities in China show little sign of war damage, which is very surprising. The situation in Manila is worse than anywhere in Japan, with the exception of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which were destroyed by atomic bombs. The Japanese destruction of Manila can be described as extremely systematic. Eisenhower added that General MacArthur's administration of Japan has been very successful. Eisenhower declined to comment on the overall situation in China.</p>

<h3>Moscow Radio Broadcasts Claim that Spain Once Planned to Seize Gibraltar, but the Plan Was Not Realized Because Germany Abandoned Its Plan to Invade Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th dispatch] Moscow Radio broadcast yesterday the remarks of former German military attachés in Madrid and Tangier, General Klammt and Colonel Lehmann (both currently detained in the Soviet Union), claiming that Spain originally intended to seize Gibraltar, but the plan was not realized after Hitler abandoned his plan to invade Britain and instead launched an attack on the Soviet Union. Spain participated in German activities during the war, followed Berlin's orders, organized the "Blue Division" to fight against the Soviet Union, and German senior officers disguised themselves as Spanish soldiers and used neutral Spanish aircraft. Spanish radio stations were also used by German army and navy authorities to transmit military intelligence. In October 1940, the German military attaché in Madrid informed Lehmann that the Spanish army planned to attack Gibraltar and could occupy it in 20 minutes. The final date for the attack on Gibraltar was set for January 10, 1941. Spain would also participate in the war as a result. Spanish and Moroccan troops would be supplemented by German troops, and Spanish Morocco also intended to invade Oran. German and Spanish forces organized a joint army to prevent Allied landings in Portugal.</p>

<h3>Yoshida Cabinet in Japan Runs into Trouble; Liberal and Progressive Parties Unevenly Distribute Positions; Social Democratic Party Challenges the Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 18th dispatch] The Yoshida Cabinet has not yet been successfully formed today. As of 5:30 p.m., only the following cabinet members have been decided: Tanzan Ishibashi as Minister of Finance, Raizo Iwata as Minister of Justice, Tsunejiro Hiratsuka as Minister of Transportation, and Shigeru Shidehara, Takao Saito, and Etsujiro Uehara as Ministers of State. The rest are still undetermined. The Progressive Party believes that only three members of its party, Shidehara, Saito, and Ichimatsu, are entering the cabinet, which is unfair compared to the number of Liberal Party members entering the cabinet. Therefore, it is still pushing for the addition of another cabinet member, showing that the Yoshida Cabinet is weak and difficult to form. The cabinet formation headquarters urgently wanted to invite Professor Seiichi Tobata of Tokyo Imperial University to serve as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry because the position is critical to the food problem, and went to great lengths to invite him. However, Tobata firmly declined. The Socialist Party issued a statement today listing the events after the dissolution of the Shidehara Cabinet, and finally said that it would oppose the Yoshida Cabinet and fight it to the end.</p>

<h3>New Mayor and His Wife Fly to Shanghai; Emphasis on Economy as Guiding Principle; Hopes that All Citizens of Shanghai Will Launch the Construction of a New Shanghai; Inauguration Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow Morning at Weekly Memorial Service</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Wu Kuo-cheng, the new mayor of Shanghai, who has been meticulously planned by the city and eagerly awaited by a million citizens, arrived in Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Flight 111 from Nanjing at 5:25 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Huang Zhuo Xuan. After disembarking, Mr. Wu smiled and took a photo with Mayor Chien before boarding a car and heading directly to his residence at the Broadway Mansions to rest. Those who went to the airport to welcome him yesterday included Mayor Chien, Deputy Mayor Ho, Shen Shihua, Feng Youzhen, Zhao Zukang, Luo Zukang, Luo Xueqian, Wang Zhuyi, and the newly appointed Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, as well as Zhang Peter, the former chief of the International Propaganda Section, and over a hundred others.</p>
<p>After arriving on the 17th floor of the Broadway Mansions, Mr. Wu met with the city's press corps and gave a speech, saying: "I came to Shanghai once in April 1937, and it has been nine years since I last set foot in Shanghai. After arriving here, I would like to express four points: (1) I express my deepest sympathy for the suffering and mental anguish endured by the people of Shanghai during the eight years under enemy oppression. Mr. Wu said: We in the interior, though we suffered material hardship, the mental anguish was even greater than the physical. (2) This time coming to Shanghai, the first thing I want to do in the city government is to be economical. Mr. Wu believes that China's war of resistance was arduous, and it is still struggling in difficulties. Civil servants should establish a frugal ethos. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, the economic center, and the general standard is higher than other places. Therefore, I hope that all citizens of Shanghai will take the lead in building a new Shanghai, not only as an example for the whole country but also to shine before foreigners." When reporters asked about the</p>
<p>governing principles and city government organization, Mayor Wu replied that the administration must be based on practical problems, and to solve difficulties, we must find the root causes. Empty thoughts, though there may be, are not sure whether they are practical. Therefore, I cannot report on the governing principles for the time being. As for the personnel changes in the city government, the mayor said that he will retain the staff of each department. Even if officials resign, if the work is needed and the performance is excellent, they will be retained with a fair attitude and sincerely invited to serve the country. Mr. Wu deeply admires Mayor Chien for serving the society and the country during the most difficult times in Shanghai and said that he would consult with him on future administration. The issue of civil servant</p>
<p>treatment is a national problem. If you want to talk about enjoyment, it is absolutely impossible, even in the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, you must be thrifty and patient and overcome the difficulties together. However, the standard of living should be maintained no matter what. Otherwise, it will be impossible to be honest and hardworking and stay in the position. This matter will also be studied in detail after taking office. In addition, the various crises in the city's industry and commerce should also be removed. The local government should be assisted by the central government, but the central laws must be faithfully observed. The mayor has absolutely no news of this. The three bureaus will abolish the deputy director system, and other bureaus will be determined according to the work. The interview lasted thirty-five minutes. At 6:40 p.m., the mayor drove to visit President Song, and at 7:30 p.m. he attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Chien to discuss the city government</p>
<p>transfer and handover steps and date. Finally, the reporter learned that the changeover of the new and old mayors has been decided to be held at the City Hall memorial week tomorrow. After the handover procedure is completed, Mayor Chien will go to Nanjing and then return to his hometown of Suzhou to visit relatives and friends. As for Chien's new position, there is still much speculation, but according to a senior official in the city government, it is likely that he will take up an important position in the military.</p>

<h3>Rising Prices, Wave of Strikes: British Tram Company Idled Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the matter of the tram company, the Chinese staff's request for improved treatment has been delayed until now and has not been resolved. The workers believe that the current salary of only 26 yuan per month for the lowest-paid workers is insufficient, so they requested an adjustment.

At noon, the three thousand-plus cleaners reluctantly left.</p>
<h3>Fish Vendors Strike, Persuasion to Resume Business</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] For two days, fresh fish has been absent in Shanghai, causing the prices of fresh meat and vegetables to rise significantly. The strike of the 83 market fish vendors was caused by a dispute between four-wheeled carts (vehicles with two-wheeled trailers) and trucks competing for transportation at the fish market. This affected the fish vendors, who could not transport the fish to the markets for sale in time, resulting in significant losses. They demanded guarantees from the fish market but received no results, so they angrily went on strike.

<h3>Improving the Treatment of Civil Servants: Legislative Yuan's Proposed Suggestions Difficult to Implement; Chiang Menglin Arrives in Shanghai for Brief Talk</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chiang Menglin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to attend today's Red Cross meeting (Mr. Chiang is the president of the association). Yesterday afternoon, he met with reporters at the Broadway Mansions and said that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan had largely come to an end. Mr. Chiang said that Vice President Weng Wenhao's resignation had been approved and he would continue to serve. Currently, the most important policy of the Executive Yuan is to find ways to suppress prices and solve the difficult living conditions of civil servants. However, it is impossible to implement the Legislative Yuan's suggestion on civil servant treatment. The main reason for rising prices is the limited sources of supply. Domestic transportation is blocked. The government spends manpower and financial resources to repair transportation repeatedly, but it is repeatedly destroyed by the Communist Party, making transportation hopeless. If the North-South transportation is opened up, prices will fall, and there will be no problem. Mr. Chiang will return to Beijing tomorrow after the Red Cross meeting.</p>

Through an introduction, he met a Russian named Yaning, who agreed to buy ten cases of American cigarettes, 200 packs per case, totaling 7,000 US dollars, and paid a deposit of 1,172 US dollars.

<h3>Girl Swindler Case: Debate Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled; Wang Guoying, Close to Tears; Sun Gongdu's Analogy of Egg Hitting Stone</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of the female swindler Wang Guoying, who used the excuse of rescuing traitors to defraud a huge sum of 5 million (currency unspecified), concluded its debate yesterday, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 25th of this month. Yesterday, Wang was still wearing a light gray suit, a red-and-white polka-dot tie, and pale yellow champagne leather shoes, but her "masculinized" face was paler than before. She wiped her eyes with a handkerchief, but no tears flowed, only rubbing her eyes red. Sun Gongdu and Zhang Weisheng were both wearing gray-black long gowns, with shaved heads, while Sun's face was darker. After Judge Cao questioned the witnesses one by one, including Wu Bingquan (brother of Wu Yonghua), Cao Wensheng (Wu's neighbor), Zhao Jianzhi (employee of the Qianzhuang), Hou Yonghua (manager of the Litai Qianzhuang), Weng Yongquan (staff member of the Xincheng Branch Judicial Section), Chen Lizhang (owner of the car company), Rong Xuefen (telephone operator at the Jinmen Hotel), Li Junfa (car driver), Zhang Daishi (wife of Zhang Weisheng), Sun Lishi (wife of Sun Gongdu), and Zhang Shuyuan, a greeter at the Jinmen Hotel, the lawyers were instructed to debate. Wang Guoying's defense lawyer, Ma Nangeng, said: To prove fraud, there must be material evidence. The police searched the defendant's room and found nothing, which shows a false accusation. All witnesses unfavorable to the defendant are relatives of the plaintiff and cannot be said to be factual evidence. Subsequently, Chen Wenju, the defense lawyer for the two defendants Sun and Zhang, claimed that the defendants were enthusiastic about helping people and were deceived by Wang Guoying, and did not commit joint fraud. The court declared the debate concluded and asked the defendants if they had anything to say. Wang Guoying said that Sun Gongdu proposed to her and borrowed money twice without success, and held a grudge, resulting in her being poisoned. "Law and reason have 70% human emotion," she asked the judge to uphold justice. Sun Gongdu said, "This time, I knew it was an egg hitting a stone, but for the sake of friends, to protect righteousness, I had to risk breaking this stone egg." Finally, he said in a stern tone: "Before I entered the police station, I still thought she was a commissioner of the National Government. How did I know she was a "menstrual belt" commissioner!" (Note: At the last trial, Wang Guoying said that all the gold bars were brought from Chongqing for buying menstrual belts.) The court adjourned at 4:35 PM.</p>

<h3>Trial of Xu Xiqing, Acting Editor-in-Chief of the Zhonghua Daily; Promotes Fallacies; Confesses to Serving in Puppet Positions; Two Puppet Officials Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years in Prison</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The traitors tried yesterday included Xu Xiqing, the acting editor-in-chief of the puppet Zhonghua Daily, Huang Liewen, the puppet county magistrate of Qingpu County, Yu Jianhong, the puppet county magistrate of Jiaxing County, Huang Yuan, the deputy general manager of the puppet Central Trust Company, Zhou Hang, [missing text] in the puppet Shaoxing enemy military police, and Zhao [missing text] Xilin, an office worker in the puppet [missing text] government and enemy military police translator. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Xiqing, from Kaiping, Guangdong, 40 years old, served as the acting editor-in-chief of the puppet Zhonghua Daily in 1940. After May 1941, he merged the puppet Zhonghua United News Agency and the Zhonghua News Agency into the "Central Censorship News Agency," serving as the [missing text] and deputy president. From 1940 to 1943, he also served as a [missing text] in the puppet Propaganda Department, overseeing all puppet propaganda duties, and contacted the enemy Allied Press to exchange news. He promoted the "peace" movement in the puppet newspaper, advocated "Greater East Asia," and sang the fallacy of "China" and Japan living and dying together, coexisting and co-prospering, inciting people's emotions and enslaving the people's minds. In May 1943, he became the Deputy Director of the Puppet Central Youth Cadre School. On January 2, 1945, he became the Deputy Secretary of the Puppet New National Movement Committee. In May 1945, he became the Deputy Dean of the Puppet Anhui Zhongshan College and other cultural puppet positions. Xu was a member of the Kuomintang, wearing a blue cloth long gown, yellow leather shoes, with thick eyebrows and a small face, slightly bald on top, speaking a bluish official language, and confessed to serving in the puppet positions. However, he claimed that the opinions of the puppet Zhonghua Daily were presided over by the "Investigation Department" and had nothing to do with him. The students of the puppet "Central Youth Cadre School" were transferred from various public and private middle schools and were not instilled with poisonous ideas. As for the "New National Movement," he said that it was another name for the New Life Movement, which was to improve the national life and education.</p>
<p>Huang Liewen, the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate, with a shaved head and a round face, wore highly myopic glasses. He was originally an underground worker sent to the occupied areas by the Third [missing text] District. He was arrested by Su [name missing] De, the puppet secret agent leader, and imprisoned in Nanjing for six months starting in May 1943. Later, in June 1944, he was arrested by "76," and after being released, he secretly reported Du Gang, who was then murdered. Huang was rewarded for this and became the puppet Qingpu County Magistrate. At the start of the trial, Huang tried to deny it. Lawyer Lu Huimin, the wife of Martyr Du, testified in court, but Zhang Yulin, Bin Hou, and Lieutenant Colonel Guan Ben, the three witnesses, did not arrive. Another witness, Du Bingrong, testified that he was doing underground work in Qingpu and was rescued by Huang, which was favorable to the defendant.</p>
<p>Jin Jianhong, from Changshu, 61 years old, was the puppet Jiaxing County Magistrate. Before the war, he served as the county magistrate of Ruian and other counties in Zhejiang, and resigned due to illness and returned to Suzhou to live in idleness. After the Anti-Japanese War, because his family was divided, he took the puppet county administration training course organized by the puppet civil affairs department of the puppet miscellaneous salary government. After graduating, he served as the Jiaxing County Magistrate until September 1942, when he was dismissed due to old age. During his tenure, he plundered supplies for enemy use and harmed innocent people. Jin confessed to serving in the puppet positions but denied all crimes.</p>
<p>Huang Yuan, from Zhongshan, 38 years old, served in the diplomatic circles before the war. In 1938, he came to Shanghai and, through Chen Jinwan's introduction, served as a secretary and counselor in the puppet Ministry of Finance and as the secretary and deputy general manager of the board of directors of the puppet Central Trust Company. He oversaw the financial hub of the puppet organization, purchased all goods for the puppet government, and specialized in disrupting the market and finance, harming merchants and people. Huang claimed that he was either a nominal position or for administrative work, trying to cover up his traitorous crimes.</p>
<p>Zhou Hang, from Liaoning, 32 years old, graduated from a puppet "Manchukuo" middle school in 1939 and was sent by enemy military police Matsui to Hangzhou, serving as a translator in the translation section of the puppet Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department. At the end of May 1944, he was transferred to the enemy military police in Shaoxing as a translator. According to his confession, he served in the puppet position for only four years. Starting on May 1, 1945, he joined the Zhongyi Save the Nation Army led by Ma Zhichao and served as an adjutant in the Xiaoshao Action [missing text] Team, so he also contributed to the resistance war.</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, from Zhenjiang, 43 years old, joined the puppet "Dadashi Government" in 1938 as an office worker. In April 1940, he was introduced by Wang Yougen to serve as a translator in the enemy Sugiura military police, and later transferred to the puppet Construction Department police Shanghai section inspector. He arrested underground comrades Zhou Fei and Feng Zili, and also introduced Qiu Wenqing and Li Chunhua to be enemy military police translators. Zhao denied all of this.</p>
<p>Sentencing of Two Traitor Cases</p>
<p>The Special Criminal Court of the High Court sentenced Fang Lixiang, secretary of the puppet Propaganda Department, and Ye Zhihua, deputy director of the Hongkou levy office of the Shishan district levy branch of the puppet Jiangsu stamp tax bureau, to two and a half years in prison each for conspiring with the enemy country and plotting to resist the country. Their civil rights were deprived for two years, and all property was confiscated except for what was necessary for the family's living expenses.</p>
<p>Conclusion of Debate in Three Cases</p>
<p>The cases of Li Yimin (from Anhui), an inspector of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Shu Jingen (from Zhenjiang), a Chinese laborer of the enemy army's 1629th unit, and Qian Nengxia (from Qingpu), director of the puppet Nanjing Municipal Economic Bureau, have been concluded after debate and are scheduled to be sentenced on the afternoon of the 25th.</p>

<h3>Founding of Chengzhong Middle School Founder Ye Chengzhong Re-erects Bronze Statue Today Inauguration Ceremony Presided Over by Director Gu of the Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Chengzhong Middle School on Tangshan Road in this city was founded during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty by Ye Chengzhong, a wealthy businessman from Zhenhai who made his fortune as a bamboo craftsman. It was the first privately funded private school in our country. During the Anti-Japanese War, all the school buildings were destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and all the school equipment was looted. The bronze statue of the founder, Ye Chengzhong, originally built on campus, was also secretly taken away by Japanese ruffians and almost melted down into weapons during the Japanese army's indiscriminate requisition of copper and iron. After the victory, a portion of the school buildings were repaired, and classes resumed. The bronze statue of the founder, Ye Chengzhong, was recently brought back to its original location and re-erected. The inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held today (the 19th) at 10:00 a.m., presided over by Gu De, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education. At that time, the school plans to print and distribute a biography of Ye Chengzhong and a record of the re-erection of the bronze statue as a commemoration. The biography is divided into the following sections:</p>
<p>Ye Chengzhong's Biography "Ye Chengzhong's Biography": Ye Chengzhong, courtesy name Chengzhong, was a native of Zhenhai, Zhejiang. His family was engaged in agriculture. His father was Zhiyu, and his mother was from the Hong family. He was the second of three brothers. He lost his father at the age of six and lived with his widowed mother and brothers, experiencing hardship. At the age of nine, he began to study with a private tutor, but after less than half a year, he dropped out of school due to poverty to help his mother with farm work. At the age of fourteen, he worked as an apprentice in a store, earning only one thousand coins a year. The mistress of the store treated him poorly, but Chengzhong remained calm and diligent in his work. After two years, his mother asked someone to speak to the store owner to request a raise of half his annual salary. Upon hearing this, the mistress said sternly, "With his talent, what he receives is already excessive. How can this be allowed?" Chengzhong heard her words and quietly left, being only sixteen years old at the time. At that time, the Treaty of Nanjing had just been concluded, and Shanghai was opened as a commercial port. Ningbo people set sail across the sea, arriving every month. Chengzhong returned home disappointed, bid farewell to his mother, and followed his neighbor Ni, boarding a boat northward. However, he had no means of paying for passage. He asked the boatman, "May I help you steer the boat in exchange for waiving my fare?" Everyone on board said, "Good!" After half a month, they arrived in Shanghai. Standing on the Bund, he had no idea what to do. A certain person, who had a small shop on the Bund, saw him and asked him the reason. Chengzhong told him everything. The person admired his ambition and allowed him to stay overnight. Chengzhong thought to himself that his knowledge was insufficient, but he could contribute with his strength. So, he carried bags for people every day, not shirking fatigue. He had enough to eat and drink and even saved money to lend to the store owner. The owner saw that he was diligent and honest, so he taught him arithmetic at night. After a year, he accumulated several thousand coins. He consulted with the store owner and began to row a boat to sell vegetables and fruits to British warships, offering fair prices and being punctual. The people on the ships all knew of his honesty, and when their tours of duty were up, they would be sure to tell each other about Chengzhong. As a result, his business flourished. Later, some officers from a warship boarded his boat and left a box on the boat. Chengzhong did not notice it at first. When he arrived at the wharf, he saw the box and realized that someone had lost it. He immediately waited by the boat. Soon, the person rowed over. Chengzhong returned the box to him. The person was overjoyed and reached into his pocket to offer him money, but he refused, saying, "I dare not accept ill-gotten gains." As a result, his reputation spread far and wide. When the store owner retired due to old age and illness, he handed the store over to Chengzhong, marking the beginning of his business career. In the first year of Tongzhi, he established Shunji Hardware Store in Hongkou, becoming the pioneer of the hardware industry in Shanghai. Westerners recognized his honesty and were happy to trade with him. Eventually, through diligence and thrift, and by treating people with honesty and integrity, his business expanded day by day. Within a few years, branch stores were established in various trading ports. He also established match and silk reeling factories in Shanghai and Hankou, with grand scale, pioneering industry and commerce, and curbing the outflow of wealth, demonstrating his far-sightedness. Later, he realized that accumulating wealth should also involve distributing wealth. Therefore, he generously donated to any public welfare cause. In his later years, while passing through Zhangjiawan in Hongkou, he saw a group of children running barefoot on the beach. He felt sorry for them and said to his friend, "I was orphaned and poor in my youth, and I always regretted not having a university education. Now I see the children of Zhangjiawan playing wildly, which must be because they have nothing to learn. I should buy land and build a school here so that the children can learn and prepare for society. I have made up my mind. Will you help me with this?" His friend said, "Good." So, they jointly bought more than eighteen acres of land, donated two hundred thousand taels of silver, and hired workers to prepare materials. After two years, the construction was completed, which is now Chengzhong Middle School. In the beginning, Westerners such as Fu Kaisen and Li Jiabai tried to prevent its completion, saying that it would be better to follow the example of Nie Zhongcheng, who donated land to establish a school and entrusted the operation to the Engineering Bureau, or that it would be better to set up a hospital to provide medical care to the poor. But he did not waver in his resolve and politely declined, showing the firmness of his will. When the school was about to open, he suddenly fell ill. He instructed Yanghu Zai Yuanruo, a historian, to write a couplet to be hung in the auditorium, which read: "I was orphaned and traveled to Shanghai in my youth, and I regretted that I was old and had not achieved anything, like walking in the dark and thinking of holding a candle"; "Now I have built a lecture hall for young children, hoping that they will study diligently and cherish every minute." Before he passed away, he sent a letter to the school board members Fan Chen and others, saying, "Chengzhong was orphaned and poor in his youth, and he regretted not having an education. He has long wanted to establish a school to help poor children. Now that the matter is just beginning, he is suffering from illness and fears that he will not live to see its completion. Gentlemen, you have been friends for a long time and will surely understand my humble intentions and strive to complete this undertaking, hoping that students will flourish and contribute to the country." His concern for the school was so great, and he can be said to have been loyal to the country. He passed away at the age of fifty-eight in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. Tang Jingchong, the Qing Dynasty's educational commissioner, learned of his deeds and petitioned for commendation and ordered the National History Museum to write his biography.</p>
<p>A Record of the Re-erection of the Bronze Statue "A Record of the Re-erection of the Bronze Statue": The statue was built in the summer of the tenth year of the Republic, marking the school's twentieth anniversary. At that time, the school board members were Chen Ruihai, Wang Haifan, Xiang Rusong, Zhang Qinxuan, Cao Lanbin, Ma Shuping, Cen Tingkang, Ye Yuhan, and Ye Xiangang. The head of the school was Cao Muguan from Shangyu. The author of the inscription was Jiang Zhiru from Zhuji. The calligrapher was Yu Tiansui from Kunshan. The person who unveiled the statue was Wang Zhengting from Fenghua. In the autumn of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, when the enemy invaded Shanghai, the school staff scattered. After the initial fall, everything was looted. On April 12 of the following year, the invaders colluded with hooligans to remove the statue from its base and carry it through the streets on the shoulders of ten people. Someone recognized it and reported it to the school. School board member Ye Xiangang and Principal Wu Cuilun met with the authorities and stored it in the police station because the school was a prohibited area and there was nothing to say. After seven years, in July of the thirty-fourth year, the enemy indiscriminately requisitioned copper and iron. The head of the Shanghai East Police Bureau came to the school and forced me to hand over the statue. I was terrified and unable to respond, so I used polite words to stall. After a month or so, the enemy's surrender was near, and I was relieved that it was safe. Now it has been brought back and re-erected. Is this not due to the spirit of the former headmaster in heaven? The only regret is that the original draft of the inscription is lost. Alas, how sad! Memorial Day of the Founding of the School in the Thirty-fifth Year of the People's Republic of China, Principal Wang</p>
<h3>Director of the Temporary National University Preparatory Class Summons Graduates for Discussion Introduces Those Proficient in Japanese to Serve in Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>[Beiping News from Dahuashe] Chen Xueping, Director of the Temporary National University Preparatory Class in Beiping, recently summoned the graduates of this year's class in the activity room of the Second Branch for a discussion. He first emphasized: After graduation, students should not have expectations that are too high, but they should also not underestimate themselves. They should maintain a thirst for knowledge and strive forward. Then, he gave four points of guidance: (1) Regarding employment, according to the previous survey of service aspirations, the results show that 250 people intend to serve in Beiping. He is currently working closely with various agencies to find ways to secure proper employment. Those proficient in Japanese can be introduced to serve in Taiwan. (2) Regarding diplomas, the issue has already been resolved. The students' opinions have already been conveyed on their behalf in Chongqing. The National Southwestern Associated University believes that since they have never seen the students, they cannot issue diplomas. In this extraordinary period, the Temporary National University Preparatory Class diploma also has precedents to follow. If you must obtain a university diploma, you can re-enroll after graduation, but he hopes that not everyone will do so. (3) The graduation exam was originally scheduled for the end of June, but because the National Southwestern Associated University will return to the north soon, the Temporary National University Preparatory Class will end on June 24 ahead of schedule. (4) Regarding the issue of food and lodging for the graduates, he is currently negotiating with the authorities to find a solution.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province's Educational Reconstruction Funds Ministry of Education Allocates Another 200 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou News from Dahuashe] The Zhejiang Provincial Education Authority had previously requested 6.05 billion yuan from the central government for educational reconstruction expenses. As a result, the Ministry of Education only allocated 60 million yuan first and borrowed 50 million yuan from local banks. Recently, although it received 200 million yuan allocated by the central government, after returning it to the local bank, only 145 million yuan remained, which is a huge difference from the original reconstruction budget. However, it is heard that in the future distribution, most of it is planned to be allocated to various provincial schools as necessary repair or equipment funds. In addition, provincial public education centers, provincial sports grounds, provincial libraries, and other social education institutions are waiting to resume activities, and a portion of this fund will be used to cover the expenses of the above institutions. Therefore, the distribution is still very difficult. The Municipal Bureau of Education Temporarily Decides to Provide Relief</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Surge Again Yesterday, Rising by 7-8,000 Yuan; Public Food Issue Intensifies; President Song Instructs on Suppression Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the rice market's upward momentum intensified, with prices skyrocketing. Both Geng rice and Xian rice varieties surged by a massive 7-8,000 yuan. Flour also followed suit, rising by another 1,000 yuan. The oil market also rose with other commodities, jumping by 6-7,000 to 8-9,000 yuan. Soybean cake followed, rising by 6-700 yuan. Soybeans were highly competitive, with prices soaring by 3-4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 1,000 yuan, and high-quality mung beans saw an increase of 1-2,000 yuan, while medium-grade remained stable. Corn also increased by over 1,000 yuan, but red sorghum remained steady. Bran was scarcely traded. Yesterday, the city's rice arrival, according to the rice market, was over 4,000 shi, with the types and quantities as follows:</p>
<p>White Geng: 1,993 shi, Du Xian: 475 shi, Bo Dao: 667 shi, Wu Xian: 120 shi, Early Rice: 832 shi, Wan Xian: 110 shi.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the city's overall food situation has reached its most critical stage. Prices of all goods have surged to unprecedented heights, causing widespread anxiety. It is understood that the total rice reserves in the city exceed one million shi. Of this amount, 40% is distributed among various households, 40% is the operating stock of rice shops, and 20% is illegally controlled by major households. Currently, some bank warehouses are storing these rice stocks for extended periods. Moreover, supply routes continue uninterrupted. Therefore, the frequent surges in rice prices in the city are purely due to the illegal activities of unscrupulous rice merchants. However, the authorities have yet to take decisive measures to severely punish them, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>President Song Cares About Public Food</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Song Ziwen, deeply concerned about the soaring rice prices affecting people's livelihoods, specially summoned Xu Jilou, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Xueyu, and others yesterday morning. He provided detailed instructions on expediting the transport of Sichuan rice eastward, purchasing foreign rice, and planning to appeal to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for assistance to supplement the food supply and thoroughly suppress grain prices. He also met with General Georgeson, Director of the U.S. Army Surplus Property Administration Committee, to inquire about relevant matters. In the afternoon around 5 p.m., Premier Song also met with Wu Kaixian, reportedly discussing matters related to resolving the labor unrest in the city.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Investigation into Rice Hoarding</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The rice reserves in this city are not lacking, and supplies arrive continuously, with daily arrivals ranging from at least 5-6,000 bags to 12,000 bags or more. However, the recent surge in rice prices indicates that unscrupulous merchants are hoarding and manipulating prices to seek illegal profits. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the city's Warehouse Industry Association to promptly investigate and report a list of the current grain reserves in each warehouse, the names and quantities of depositors, and the dates of deposit, for verification. Meanwhile, market supervision will be strengthened, and any illegal trading activities will be immediately reported for legal action.</p>
<p>[East China News Agency] City Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, accompanied by Labor Association Chairman Zhu Xuefan, recently went to the central government in Nanjing to report on their duties and request instructions on handling the labor unrest in Shanghai. After completing their tasks, they returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. An East China News Agency reporter interviewed Wu to inquire about his views on the soaring rice prices. According to him, the recent surge in rice prices has drawn urgent attention from all sectors. He is deeply concerned and believes that to suppress grain prices, it is essential to effectively unblock supply channels and prevent market supply disruptions. Wu also stated that he advocates implementing rice rationing. The current Baojia system in the city has been established, and the government can utilize Baojia to distribute rice to citizens at low prices, which could potentially resolve the public food problem.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Goes to Nanjing for Instructions</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The upward momentum of the rice market continued unabated yesterday. Our reporter specially visited the Acting Special Envoy of the Grain Administration, Mr. Wang Daren. According to Wang, he had visited the Municipal Government Secretary-General, Mr. He DeKui, yesterday morning due to the repeated surges in rice prices. Mr. He expressed great concern about the matter. Wang then stated that the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation has ordered three batches of foreign rice in the past two days: the first batch of 8,000 tons, the second batch of 9,600 tons, and the third batch of one million bags (each bag weighing 60 kilograms, equivalent to 120 jin), which will be successively shipped to the city. The estimated price upon arrival in Shanghai is approximately 35,000 yuan per shi, making the continued rise in rice prices perplexing. Wang will take the night train to Nanjing last night to seek instructions from the Minister of Food, Mr. Xu Kan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Steadily Rise in Shanghai; Spot Supply Insufficient</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw a sudden surge. Tianjin buyers showed a particular preference for old brands of Japanese mills, such as Sun Brand, Fengnian, Shuiyue, and Lanfeng, in the 20-count yarn category. The price of 20-count Sun Brand skyrocketed from 1.15 million to 1.23 million, a jump of 100,000 compared to the previous day. Due to this, 20-count Double Horse yarn also gradually increased to 1.28 million. Other small and medium-sized yarns, with fewer buyers, only increased by 2-30,000. 42-count double-ply yarn remained highly sought after, with Lanfeng closing at a new high of 2.45 million, and the spot supply remained insufficient.</p>
<p>The cloth market was influenced by the soaring gold and yarn prices, leading to higher prices. The Textile Construction Corporation offered 26 types of cloth for sale, along with 15 types of American and Mexican cloth.</p>
<p>In the flower market, New York American cotton prices fell by 7-16 points. The recent price for American dollars was 27.15, the forward price was 27.62, and the current price for Michelin was 27.75. Cotton trading in this city was relatively active, with private yarn mills such as Xinsheng, Dasheng, and Shenxin No. 1 all making purchases, and smaller trades also occurring among industry members.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Inspecting the qualities of red and green tea, Tianjin buyers' appetite has decreased, while sales in local shops and in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places are very smooth. However, only low-grade teas are selling well, with less demand for high-grade teas. Prices have remained relatively stable due to balanced supply and demand, and have not seen significant fluctuations. As for Zhenmei and Te Chou Gongxi teas, which are sold exclusively abroad, according to news from Jardine Matheson and Ruichang trading companies, they are still interested in importing teas with consistent quality. It is also reported that a tea company in this city recently received a telegram from Morocco, stating that Zhenmei green tea is in high demand, but due to various reasons, export sales are still difficult to improve significantly.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Trending Slightly Lower; Cotton White Manufacturers Request Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Association quoted 67,000 yuan for medium-grade white sugar, a slight decrease of over 1,000 yuan. Raw sugar remained unchanged at 57,000 yuan. Third-grade white sugar Association warehouse warrants were quoted at 74,000 to 74,500 yuan, and second-grade white sugar third-grade carload was quoted at 65,000 yuan. Chao Tang (teacart) Zhuang Qing (color) was quoted at 60,000 yuan. The purchase of goods from this manufacturer was not completed due to the tax on goods and the complicated procedures. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials (medium-grade sugar) is high, resulting in high production costs. The prices of three-grade cars are approaching white prices, therefore little or no profit may be made. There is more concern about losing money, resulting in most cotton manufacturers shutting down. They are requesting a tax exemption, with the reasoning that middle-grade white has already been taxed so also collecting taxes on the white cotton amounts to double taxation on the same good. If the tax exemption is hopeless, then the cotton can not continue to be cooked, and then the price is expected to jump by about three to five cars.</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Shanghai Pig Bristles Awaiting Shipment</h3>
<p>Pig bristles are sluggish in the United States, so the Shanghai market is not as active as last month. Currently, the price of Shanghai 17 bristles has dropped to 400,000 yuan per customs tael (关祖) within the customs, and there are still few inquiries. Pig bristles from Chongqing and Tianjin, due to their better quality, are still occasionally purchased by various exporters. It is reported that the Central Trust Bureau's Purchasing Department has recently purchased 4-5,000 boxes in Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Combined with previous purchases, the total exceeds 10,000 boxes, which are currently being concentrated in Tianjin and Shanghai, awaiting export.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Export Allowed Before April 13th</h3>
<p>Fully Prohibited Starting May 11th</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 18th] The Indian government has issued a notice stating that all cotton exports before April 13th will receive government permission. Exports between April 13th and May 11th will be approved or denied based on their nature. Exports after May 11th will not be approved, meaning that cotton exports will be completely prohibited.</p>
<h3>Increased Buyers, Tight Market; Gold Price Exceeds 1.9 Million Mark; U.S. Dollar Also Rises by 80 Yuan</h3>
<p>Spot gold prices gradually increased under heavy buying from the public, with unanimous optimism. Supply was insufficient and the number of lots for sale were thinning. Thus, although prices opened steadily in the morning, they tended towards firmness after trading opened. Gold prices in other locations were higher than in this city, and rumors circulated on the streets and in alleys, encouraging buying. Around 10 a.m., prices rose to around 1.86 million. The Bank of China allocated 365 bars to the industry at a price of 1.85 million. After the allocation was completed, prices immediately rose to 1.88 million and then hovered around that level. Prices retreated to 1.86 million, but holders had great expectations, leading to a tight market. At noon, prices finally exceeded the 1.9 million mark. In the afternoon, prices rose to around 1.92 million before stabilizing. As a result, prices closed up 90,000 compared to the previous close. Silver jewelry was priced at 200,300. Taels of silver rose slightly to 1,700, silver dollars rose slightly to 1,150 with buyers. The interest rate was balanced at one cent and a half to one cent and eight points.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, specifically U.S. dollars, followed the gold market's rise, gradually increasing from an opening of 2,310 yuan in the morning. Foreign firms, seeing the unfavorable trend, made some purchases. In the afternoon, they were subjected to selling, thus prices pushed past 2,400. The afternoon trend continued to be strong. The arbitrage against gold widened to around 790 yuan per 10 taels, which made it appropriate to lead to buying. As a result, prices closed up another 80 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were stable, closing up 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was adjusted upwards to around 425 yuan by a foreign firm with flowered garments. The Robi (Japanese currency) was the same, rising strongly to 525 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate was slightly higher.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Rise in Various Locations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] Today, the black market price of gold remains stable at 200,300 yuan, and the price of U.S. dollars is 2,480 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The price of gold continues to rise to 204,500 yuan, the price of U.S. dollars is 2,210 yuan, and the price of Hong Kong dollars is 416 yuan. The price of rice has fallen back, with high-grade rice at 62,000 yuan per 100 jin, and medium-grade rice at 55,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] Today, grain prices have fallen. Rice is priced at 490 yuan per jin, local flour is priced at 27,200 yuan per bag, gold is priced at 200,650 yuan, and U.S. dollars are priced at 2,525 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Wuxi, 18th] The price of rice has exceeded 60,000 yuan, and silver jewelry is selling for 205,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Continue to Decline; Only China Textiles and Yong Tai Yarn Perform Well</h3>
<p>Government bonds struggled to rally yesterday, but short sellers saw opportunities for profit and made slight adjustments. The overall trend remained stable. The morning opening price of the C-Type Bond (統丙) was slightly lower at 6,600 yuan, but then fell to a low of 6,400 yuan. Short sellers saw a net profit of over 1,000 yuan and slightly covered their positions at lower prices, pushing the price up to 6,750 yuan. Ultimately, the price remained below the morning opening price at noon, as speculative funds favored gold and dollars. The closing price was down 100 yuan compared to the previous close. A-type and B-type bonds were down 250 yuan, D-type bonds were down 200 yuan, and E-type bonds were down 100 yuan. Buying interest in Chinese stocks gradually increased, but the overall market had not yet recovered. Only China Textiles and Yong Tai Yarn were performing well. Yong Tai Yarn was stimulated by the upcoming shareholder meeting and performed much better than Meyer, gradually increasing from 5,000 yuan to 5,350 yuan. Meyer increased from 4,080 yuan to 4,250 yuan, but then lacked momentum. Most speculative funds flowed to gold and dollars, and prices closed lower at noon. Small stocks such as Jingfu remained weak and failed to make any progress. The closing prices of Yong Tai Yarn was slightly up. Meyer stocks fell slightly, and stocks of Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing also declined slightly. Foreign stocks rebounded after falling to a low point, with mixed results compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tungsten and Antimony to be Exported Soon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The London metal industry expects that China will export tungsten ore and antimony in the near future. Antimony and tungsten are important export commodities of China, accounting for two-thirds of the world's needs. At the same time, London's inventory is extremely scarce, but it is believed that the government's stored tungsten is quite abundant.</p>
<h3>1,000 Bales of Chinese Silk to be Shipped to the U.S.</h3>
<p>According to Sun Bohuo, director of the business department of the China Sericulture Company, last month the company had 500 bales of raw silk waiting to be exported, but due to the lack of time, the shipment was delayed. Therefore, the quantity of this shipment has also increased, totaling 1,000 bales, which are scheduled to be shipped to the U.S. on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Sells Silk Fabrics, etc., Bidding Opens Yesterday; 50,000 Feet of Lumber Not Awarded</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the sale of government materials and property, conducted its fourth auction of materials, including 3,129 pieces of various fabrics, 209 packages of yarn, 45 large boxes of 120-count Jin Sanma rayon, 500 bundles of 120-count miscellaneous rayon, and 2,000 empty iron barrels. The deadline for submitting bids was 12:00 noon yesterday, and the bidding opened at 3:00 p.m., supervised by personnel from the Shanghai Audit Office of the Auditing Department and the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property. According to the person in charge of the auction, the first auction of 50,000 cubic meters of lumber did not result in any winners because the highest bid was lower than the internal reserve price. In the second auction of 3,190 pieces of various fabrics and some packages of yarn, the winners were Tong Taichang, Yongchang, Hong Dachang, and three other cotton fabric companies. In the third auction of 211 boxes of rayon, 138 small packages of yarn, 120 packages of yarn, 84 bundles and 74 small packages of fine cloth, and 76 bundles of 42-count Lanfeng double-strand thread, the sole winner was Heng Kang Yarn and Thread Company.</p>
<h3>Predictions for the Wool Fabric Market Vary Widely</h3>
<p>Yesterday, apart from Pai Lisi, Fan Li, Xiang Yu yarn, gabardine, and thick serge, which had some retail sales, there was little activity in the wool fabric market. Standard market conditions remained ostensibly stable but internally weak. Industry insiders had different opinions regarding the future market prospects. Those who expected prices to fall believed that prices in various parts of China had risen by 4,000 to 10,000 times the average level in 1937, while prices in foreign countries such as the U.S., Britain, and Australia had only risen by several hundred or a little over a thousand times. Therefore, the actual price of imported wool fabrics would be much cheaper than the prices in Shanghai. Moreover, with the current gold and rice frenzy, the cost of tailoring a suit had risen to over 100,000 or even 200,000 yuan. The public was struggling to afford food and daily necessities, and would naturally economize on semi-luxury goods such as wool fabrics. Therefore, they predicted that the future supply of wool fabrics would be abundant, and market prices would inevitably fall, and sales would definitely be more sluggish than at present. However, some others believed that there was no need to be pessimistic because the recent orders were incomplete in terms of patterns and colors. Although the prices were low, there were few direct manufacturers, and foreign trading companies were earning substantial profits by acting as intermediaries. Orders placed before the war did not have fixed foreign exchange rates, but now they all had fixed rates, and the cost of interest over four to five months would also increase invisibly. In the current environment, everything remained volatile. There was the possibility of continued adjustments to foreign exchange rates and taxes, and shipping and import procedures could not be as efficient as before. The cost of living was unlikely to decrease in the short term, local production was lacking, and costs were increasing. They predicted that the arrival of goods in large quantities would not be as ideal as expected by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Factories Federation Appeals on Behalf of Robbed Cotton Mill Owners, Providing Proof of the Circumstances</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the National Goods Factories Federation held its first board of directors meeting of the current term. It was resolved to appoint Executive Director Zhang Zilian as the authorized representative to appeal to the highest authorities for the return of the remaining cotton cloth looted by the enemy, in order to alleviate the difficulties faced by businessmen. The document stated, "In August 1943, the enemy puppets forcibly purchased cotton cloth in Shanghai, causing heavy losses to the victimized manufacturers. After the victory, there was still a portion of the remaining cotton cloth, which was transferred by the Puppet Business Association to the Enemy Property Administration Bureau for receipt. This remaining cotton cloth originally belonged to dyeing and weaving and cotton cloth mill owners, and it was their only remaining blood and sweat. Therefore, the city's dyeing and weaving industry and the cotton cloth and cotton yarn business trade associations have repeatedly petitioned for consideration of the merchants' difficulties and for the return of the cotton cloth. Among them, several companies such as Yongxin, Yongchang, and Licheng had been approved for return by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. Subsequently, the bureau's review committee overturned the approved cases, arguing that the enemy puppets' method of purchasing cotton cloth was favorable and that the merchants had not suffered much loss, and transferred the cotton cloth to the China Textile Construction Corporation for auction. This has left the 3,000+ victimized factories with no recourse. Consequently, cotton cloth merchants went on strike for two days. During his years in the rear area, Zilian was ordered to handle relief efforts. After returning to Shanghai after the victory, he heard that the enemy puppets' purchase of cotton cloth was indeed a forced purchase at low prices, and there were absolutely no favorable circumstances. As a result, cotton cloth mill owners went bankrupt and shut down. It is therefore believed that the remaining cotton cloth should be returned to show the government's concern for the people. We hereby respectfully report to you and request that you instruct the Enemy Property Administration Bureau to consider returning the cotton cloth so that the closed factories can resume operations as soon as possible and the hundred thousand unemployed workers can return to work. We await your urgent instructions. National Goods Factories Federation of Shanghai, Authorized Representative Zhang Zilian."</p>

<h3>Changchun in Twenty-Nine Days</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Continued from Yesterday's First Page</p>
<p>This reporter estimates that Changchun cannot be defended unless the National Army advancing north from Sipingjie can reach it quickly. However, as of this day, only one piece of news was obtained in Changchun: the New First Army is 66.9 miles from Changchun, vague and unclear about the specific situation.</p>
<p>Defending Changchun are the Second and Fourth Security Regiments, including six regiments. The Changchun police have eight branch bureaus, one police brigade, including six companies, totaling over 1,000 people. In addition, there are two police regiments of the Jilin Provincial Government that retreated from Jiutai, approximately 2,000+ people. These three groups total about 12,000 people, which is the entire force defending Changchun.</p>
<p>Here, it must be pointed out that the Security Regiment was airlifted from Beiping at the beginning of this year. In the past, it was the "Iron and Stone Troops" of the puppet Manchurian army, which had entered eastern Hebei to fight until the Japanese surrendered on August 15th. Liu Depu, the commander of the Second Regiment, was a "Iron and Stone Troops" regimental commander, Wang Zhengguo, the chief of staff, was a colonel in the puppet Manchurian army and had served as the chief of the military affairs section of the puppet Manchurian military department; Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the Fourth Regiment, was also a regimental commander in the puppet Manchurian army, and Shi Zongzhong, the chief of staff, served as the translator and lieutenant of the Japanese military police advisor Kuroda in the puppet Manchurian army. These troops reorganized by the government have become political propaganda material against the Communist Party's military offensive against Changchun.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Withdraws, Communist Army Advances on Suburbs</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of the Soviet army, what is the topic in China here? The situation is now very clear: start fighting. As the Soviet army withdraws, the Communist army advances in the suburbs. On the 9th, thousands of Communist soldiers took a train south in Dehui and got off at Mishazi Station, ten kilometers north of Changchun. Later, the reporter asked the commander of the Communist army attacking Changchun about this matter, and his reply was this: "We came from Harbin, all on foot. When we arrived at Dehui, we saw empty carriages, and the brothers climbed on them, forcing the driver to drive. The Soviets don't get along well with us." On the 12th, Mengjiatun, Songjiawazi, and the vicinity of the airport were already in contact. In any case, as soon as Karnov left, the prelude to a great war was opened. When we left the train station, Zhuzhou's car drove away. It was too crowded for eight people to sit in a jeep, so we borrowed Zhang Datong's car. Beckett from the Associated Press, weighed the most among the eight, and his wine glass was never far from his hand. His appearance was similar to Goering. Because he was bored, while the other four were competing with Karnov and others on the platform, he went to the Soviet shopkeeper's station restaurant to drink vodka. With a shout, we eight people immediately squeezed into the car to go to the airport. Everyone was eager to see the war.</p>
<h3>Soft Protest: We Must See the War</h3>
<p>Zhang Datong was timid and cautious, saying that there was a war going on and we couldn't go. We made a soft protest to him, saying that we were war correspondents, leaving him with no choice. But he believed that he had some responsibility for the safety of each person in his position as a government official, so he was quite worried, but he still sat in the car and went with us.</p>
<p>We didn't know the situation at all. The car sped along, and the people - Chinese and Japanese - were all in a daze. They stood in the streets, listening to the distant gunfire, not knowing what was going on. The car headed northwest, passing over the Xing'an Bridge. Below the bridge was the railroad. Here, 2,000 meters away from Datong Square in the city center, the people who wanted to cross the bridge could not pass and stopped at the Xing'an Avenue intersection east of the bridge. The gunfire became clearer.</p>
<p>After being questioned by the police guarding the bridge, the two cars continued forward. As a result, the gunfire naturally became louder and louder, and we could hear the layers of distance. At this time, there were no pedestrians on the road. After crossing the bridge for 1,000 meters, we arrived in front of the old Institute of Hygiene Technology and the Qianzao Hospital. We determined that the location of the gunfire was not far away, at most 500 meters. At this time, a military truck drove up in front and said that it was impossible to go any further. We immediately got out of the car and walked. Wheeler, Lippmann, Eberna, and Madsen ran the fastest, lined up and ran in the center of the road. Shenzhi and Beckett walked along the walls. We didn't know where the defensive positions were, we just walked along the road, seemingly searching forward, and it was quite possible to run to the attacking side.</p>
<h3>Bullets Whizzing as the Car Returns</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Datong drove the car back again, seemingly urging us to return, which was truly terrible. We hurried back, telling the driver to drive back quickly, then turned around to run forward again. A stray bullet whizzed past, and everyone quickly crouched down, running across Xing'an Square.</p>
<p>From Xing'an Square to the city's central square, from northwest to southeast, was a straight Xing'an Avenue, about 4,500 meters long, with streetcar tracks running all the way to near the West Airport. This place was very desolate. Although it was within the city limits, it was not yet fully developed, mostly vacant land, with withered grass and a bleak atmosphere. Adding to this, many of the buildings were already dilapidated, creating a completely war-torn atmosphere, as if a three-month-long battle had already been fought here. An empty streetcar was parked on the north side of the square.</p>
<p>The six of us continued to run forward, and we found the garrison's stronghold, the "Northeast Red Cross," two hundred meters past the square. The garrison saw our group of uninvited guests, pulled open the barbed wire piled on the side door, and let us in. The garrison was inside the building, gathered on the rooftop on the third floor, firing north. We only saw the ground covered with spent cartridges.</p>
<h3>Indiscriminate Firing Without Identifying Targets</h3>
<p>This was a company of the Fourth General Detachment. The company commander was flushed, and the soldiers all looked nervous. It was clear at a glance that they were all novices who had never fought before. We were all curious because we didn't see any movement on the other side.</p>
<p>"What are you shooting at?" Shen Zhi asked.</p>
<p>The company commander and his soldiers pointed and told everyone that people were hiding in one of the buildings in front. "We saw dozens of people run inside."</p>
<p>"So, do you know who these people are?"</p>
<p>"Not clear."</p>
<p>"Why don't you send someone to investigate?" There was no answer. They had not sent plainclothes scouts, had not sent reconnaissance troops, had not done any search work, had no intelligence, and did not even have a telephone. The whole company was isolated in this building, firing indiscriminately before even identifying the targets. So, when a real battle came, they would probably be silent.</p>
<p>It seemed that, as far as this stronghold was concerned, it had already put on a defensive posture. The city was vast, and the troops were already scattered. We looked around with binoculars. After about thirty minutes, no bullets came from the other side. The soldiers couldn't stand it anymore, and when their hands itched, they fired two shots, as if to say: We are here, we are a bit at a loss. The first time soldiers go to war is the most absurd.</p>
<p>In fact, we later learned that there were indeed a small number of communist troops. The airport was definitely impossible to pass, as fighting was ongoing. So we had to return. Beckett quickly went back to the train station to buy half a dozen bottles of vodka. Fortunately, these things saved him, otherwise, he would have had to hang himself in the days to come. Beckett and Lippmann, because they did not go forward, had a big discussion with us about the Chinese view of life.</p>
<p>That day, there was supposed to be a plane flying from Shenyang to land and then fly to Harbin, which had been arranged with the Soviets. This was also the first plane to fly to Harbin. But when it arrived in Changchun, there was fighting below, so it flew straight to Harbin. Two hours later, it flew back. At this time, the gunfire had temporarily stopped, and it circled and landed. Jin Enxin, the commander of the 14th Air Force District of Changchun, immediately jumped on the plane and flew to Shenyang. The previous day, when we asked him if he was going to Shenyang to study air transport, he said it was. As soon as the plane took off, the fighting started again below. The communist troops bombarded the airfield and air station with artillery, and after late at night, the airport telephone lines were cut.</p>
<p>Very good, the external communication lines were completely cut off. Zi Men and Zhu Zhou Zhuo, the four of us, were still in the Mantan Building, looking at each other and couldn't help laughing. The meaning was, "Just wait, there's no way to leave Changchun now, air transport? It's over too."</p>
<p>Tonight, the Ministry of Communications radio station in the Mantan Building moved to the Central Bank, unable to send out any news. The Mantan Building was quiet, and the sound of gunfire faintly carried over. Fighting was going on on the southwest, east, and three sides, truly lively. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Heartfelt Appeal</h3>
<p>— Gu Yangping</p>
<p>Editor: After reading your newspaper's editorials "The Third Party Cannot Be Confused" and "Recognizing the Crux of the Political Stalemate," I understand that your newspaper is taking a very regrettable and anxious attitude because the public is not paying attention to serious national affairs and is not responding. It is indeed a very dangerous thing for the people to not pay attention to national affairs. But how can the poor Chinese people express that they are not confused? Their sorrow and pain cannot be imagined by anyone. If the political parties were willing to accept some of the people's appeals, the people would not be so silent. In any case, the struggle for political power, the struggle to avenge past grievances, is a struggle for private and partisan interests and does not put the people first. The Chinese people are deeply disgusted with political parties and politicians. Party strife has destroyed the fruits of victory, party strife has hindered national construction, party strife has undermined international standing, and party strife has created the unprecedented crises of famine, rural bankruptcy, economic crisis, educational stagnation, soaring prices, and rampant speculation in China today. The parties are wantonly poisoning the people and wantonly destroying the country. Seeing this land, freshly washed with the blood of countless Chinese men, so fragmented, our tears cannot help but flow!</p>
<p>If your newspaper is willing to sacrifice some valuable space, let us express some final appeals! We see very clearly why the Chinese Communist Party has such momentum. Because in the current era of the collapse of imperialism and the financial constraints of capitalist countries, Marxist thought seems to have become the highest political ideal. The Chinese Communist Party has used communism as a guise, attracting some intellectuals, cultural circles, self-proclaimed progressive youth, and poor people. At the same time, the Chinese Kuomintang is not living up to expectations, refusing to face the hardships of the people and refusing to make a firm decision to clean up the bureaucracy. When we hear that a cocktail party can support poor people for more than a year, everyone wants to become a communist! The Communist Party has thus gained great power. When the Communist Party gained power through speculation, it forgot about communism. First, it wanted to avenge its eighteen years of grievances with the Kuomintang; second, it wanted to satisfy its aspirations for political status. Under this intense emotion, they themselves forgot the original purpose of liberating the people, and they shattered the banner they had proclaimed. They oppose one-party dictatorship; but in their area, they do not allow the existence of other parties. They demand freedom of speech; but in their area, they do not allow dissenting opinions. They demand democracy; but they organize many cadres to control the actions of the people. They claim to liberate the people; but countless wailing people flee from the "liberated areas." They also say they respect the Founding Father; but they distort the theory of the Three Principles of the People. These cases of selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head are too numerous to mention. Even more contemptible, they shamelessly claimed that more than 200 industrial facilities in the Northeast were intact, which really shocked us! The Soviet Union has already admitted in its reply to the US protest that the materials dismantled and transported were war spoils. Why does the Chinese Communist Party have to stubbornly conceal and cover up the loss of national rights and interests? This kind of flattering attitude makes us dare not imagine the intentions of the Communist Party. We strongly suspect that the Chinese Communist Party will become an organization like Shi Yirou Keng. The Soviet Communist Party only knows how to work hard for construction, but the Chinese Communist Party only knows how to work hard for destruction. The Soviet Communist Party strives for national strength, but the Chinese Communist Party aims to weaken national power and be a vassal. Why does the Chinese Communist Party have to fall to this point? The Communist Party has clearly exposed two dangerous mistakes; first, they think that abandoning the concept of nation in communism means becoming a vassal of others. Second, they think that the class equality of communism does not have the concept of rights and obligations. Regardless of right and wrong, they fulfill their obligations to the fullest extent, and the rights and interests they obtain should be the same as the obligations they fulfill to one-fifth of their ability. From this, we can prove that the Communist Party's use of force to seize territory is meaningless and has no different intentions from Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, the wandering bandits of the late Ming Dynasty! We earnestly appeal, hoping that the Chinese Communist Party, for the sake of the country and the people, and for the sake of the future and status of their own party, should immediately stop the actions of looting and destruction. If the Chinese Communist Party can take good care of the country and show compassion for the people, they will definitely achieve their political aspirations. Why do they only believe in force and not trust the great power of the people?</p>
<p>From overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, completing the Northern Expedition, to winning the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Kuomintang has indeed done its best and made the greatest contribution to saving the country and the nation. Now they are shouldering the heavy responsibility of national construction again. They are fulfilling their responsibilities to the country, and we cannot bear to overthrow them for no reason. However, the Kuomintang's political stubbornness, numbness, and sluggishness in recent years have indeed caused dissatisfaction among many people. Why not thoroughly clean up the bureaucracy? Why not sacrifice the special enjoyment and power of the bureaucrats and dignitaries? Why not face the hardships of the people? Why not stabilize the lives of public school teachers? Why not give out-of-school youth the opportunity and convenience to receive education? Why not really work hard to curb prices? Why only focus on the decoration of cities and ignore the collapse of rural areas? Why does a public affair have to "wait for instructions and then follow them," making a big detour and showing off, instead of striving for improvement in administrative efficiency? In this way, not only has it created an excuse for the Communist Party to attack, but the people are also unbearably anxious. We earnestly appeal, hoping that the Kuomintang will immediately save itself and the country and use a frank and refreshing new spirit to thoroughly improve politics. Our position is to absolutely support the national policy of nationalizing the army, maintaining sovereignty, and unifying government orders, but we also sympathize with the political ideals of the Communist Party and oppose one-party dictatorship. We do not hope that any party will only use the banner of "democracy" to whet our appetites. We only hope that everyone can accept our heartfelt appeal. Whoever is willing to accept our appeal is the truly democratic party! Gu Yangping, May 16.</p>
<p>Comic Strip "Sanmao Joins the Army" (8) by Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>The Two Heroes of the Northeast Corner</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Editorial Office of This Newspaper</p>
<p>A correspondent for the Los Angeles Times recently sent a telegram from Shenyang saying that the leaders of both the Nationalist and Communist parties here have privately stated that decisive military action is inevitable before peace can be achieved in the Northeast. If this statement is true, then the future battle for Changchun will be a wonderful performance between China's two finest military men. Their achievements are comparable to those of the two American heroes, Generals Grant and Lee.</p>
<p>Both Excellent Military Men Were Students of the Whampoa Military Academy</p>
<p>These two excellent military men are General Du Yuming, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army in the Northeast, and General Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army. One commands the Nationalist Army in various battles from the headquarters in Shenyang, and the other commands the Communist combat troops from a mobile headquarters. Both graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy, Du in 1924 and Lin a year later.</p>
<p>General Du Yuming, a Genius of Mechanized Warfare</p>
<p>Du Yuming was born in Shanxi Province in 1903. After enlisting, he was promoted from platoon leader to general for his meritorious service in combat and was praised as a genius of mechanized warfare in China. In 1939, Du organized the 200th Division of the Chinese Army's First Mechanized Unit. In 1942, as commander of the Fifth and Sixth Armies, he entered Burma with General Stilwell, and after Japan surrendered, he withdrew from Burma with Stilwell.</p>
<p>After returning to China, Du re-established the Chinese mechanized units that had defeated the Japanese army in Burma and South China. He has a military demeanor, a handsome appearance, and looks like he is not yet forty-three years old. Du is frank and amiable, and although he is busy planning and commanding military affairs, he never refuses to meet visiting guests.</p>
<p>If They Disobey Orders, the Government Will Surely Defeat the Communist Army</p>
<p>Du spoke frankly about the importance of the government's mission in the Northeast. He once told reporters: "If there is a second army in a country that is detrimental to that country, then that country will never be peaceful. Therefore, either the Communist Party must obey the orders of the government, or the government must defeat the Communist army."</p>
<p>Du said that the biggest obstacle to peace in China is the Communist Party's failure to abide by the agreement signed by Zhou Enlai and Marshall on January 25, which stipulated that the Communist army should be incorporated into the newly编的国民军内的。</p>
<p>Lin Biao Engaged in Long-Term Guerrilla Warfare in Southern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Lin Biao is the Communist Party's most outstanding tactician, and he can be said to be a worthy opponent to the sophisticated and capable Du Yuming. Lin is short and stout, with a gentle manner and a quiet demeanor, and looks very much like a university professor. However, he has a reputation as a strategist and commander, and even government publications praise his achievements.</p>
<p>Lin Biao was born in Huang'an, Hubei Province, in 1907. After graduating from middle school, he entered the Guangdong Whampoa Military Academy in 1924 and graduated in 1925. After the split between the Nationalists and the Communists in 1927, he joined the Communist army. From 1927 to 1928, he followed Mao Zedong in guerrilla warfare in the mountains of southern Jiangxi, fighting until the entire guerrilla force was reduced to less than one hundred people.</p>
<p>Yan'an "Rest and Recuperation" Was a Deliberate Plan for the Northeast War</p>
<p>Lin first showed his outstanding talents when he made the Long March to Jinggang Mountain in 1928. The following year, he was appointed commander of the Fourth Red Army, and in 1932 he was promoted to commander of the First Red Army Group. At that time, he was only twenty-five years old. In 1937, he served as commander of the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army. At that time, the Communist Party had united with the Nationalist Army to jointly resist Japan. He defeated a brigade of the Japanese army in northern Shanxi, which made him famous for a time. He later fought many more victories.</p>
<p>According to the Communist Party, Lin lived in Yan'an throughout the second half of the Sino-Japanese War for rest and recuperation. But now it seems that he had been burying himself in planning for the Northeast War for many years, because when he came to the Northeast last August, he brought a group of outstanding staff officers from the Communist Party, many of whom were psychology experts. The Communist Party attaches great importance to operational psychology, and they believe that the influence of the people in the war zone is just as important as the deployment of the army.</p>
<p>The future battle for Changchun is a crucial key to gaining strategic control of the entire Northeast. The main question is whether Du Yuming's American-equipped New First Army, supported by the air force, can overwhelm Lin Biao's mixed army, which emphasizes mental training.

<h3>A Short Stay in Luodong</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mu Yun, Luodong, Taiwan, 11th Aviation News</p>
<p>In Hedong Suao, the reporter spent three full days inspecting the local customs and folk customs, and visited the cement factory taken over by the Industrial and Mining Office and the local unique carbonated water factory. On the 10th, we took the 11:18 train again and arrived in Luodong in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Luodong is a town between Yilan and Suao. The total population of the area is about 40,000, with five townships. Because it is a distribution market for Taitung materials, it is far more prosperous than Suao. In the past, the Japanese had three hotels, and only two remained after the Retrocession. We stayed at the Xinhua Hotel, which was taken over by people from Yangzhong County in the mainland.</p>
<p>Forest Railway. There is a railway station from Luodong to Tuchang, which is called the "Forest Railway," because it takes two hours to walk from Tuchang to the base camp of Hinoki forest - Taipingshan. The place is 58.6 kilometers away from Luodong, the foothills are low tropical forests, while the Nanhu Mountain at an altitude of 3,797 meters has cold temperate forests. The area of ​​this forest is 63.177 hectares, and the amount of stored needle-leaved trees is 6,810.848, broad-leaved trees are 13,053.695, a total of 19,864.543 cubic meters, and its storage capacity may exceed Alishan. The current logging volume in Luodong district is about 80,000 stones of cypress wood (each stone is 4,500 catties) and 120,000 stones of miscellaneous wood per year. If the current price of cypress wood products is calculated at 540 yuan per stone, this number is quite amazing. (In the past, cypress wood - logs were priced at 40 yuan per stone, and now they have risen to 260 yuan. Miscellaneous wood products used to be priced at 80 yuan per stone, and now they have risen to 540 yuan.) Because a part of the forest railway was destroyed by floods and has not been repaired until now, and the price of gasoline is high and there is a shortage of goods, transportation is very difficult, so to expand the forest production capacity, the restoration of the transportation line can no longer be delayed. A large amount of wood is piled up along the railway line here. There are more than a dozen fairly large sawmills, which are being worked in a state of semi-idleness under the takeover of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Fanggan Factory was taken over, and some are operating personal businesses under the guise of official names. This phenomenon of ebb is making people very pessimistic about the future of the forest industry.</p>
<p>Aboriginal Aversion. There are more than 2,000 Gaoshan ethnic groups on Taiping Mountain, most of which are semi-civilized aborigines. Thirty years ago, the Japanese spent eight or nine years and used all kinds of methods to "conquer" them. After the Retrocession, there was a period when the National Army recruited volunteers, and more than 300 Gaoshan ethnic groups came, but because of some trivial matters, they all returned to the mountains. It is difficult to say whether anyone is supporting this aversion behind the scenes, but it is very believable that if they are oppressed by force when they are averse, at least it is impossible at present. It is difficult to grasp how much cypress branch ammunition is stored in the deep mountains. Therefore, when the reporter wanted to go to Taiping Mountain, local friends tried their best to stop my attempt. The beautiful scenery of this ancient forest can only be left for later.</p>
<p>Rice Area Famine. Luodong is a rice-producing area. In the plains for dozens of miles, two crops of rice are planted every year. The reporter passed by various places, all of which were rice fields. Now it is almost the ripening period, and at most there is one month before it can be harvested.</p>
<p>The whole province is now experiencing a food shortage. In Suao, it goes without saying that people are using sweet potatoes as the main food. However, in the producing area of ​​Luodong, the market price is also 500 yuan per stone (23 catties in Shanghai), and cries of hunger are heard everywhere. This is the most noteworthy fact. The参议会员提出的台湾闹米荒, and上海却有台米可买, 也 没 得到 具体的 答复. Historically, the rice produced here, if it is a bumper year, is enough to meet the consumption of the province for three years. Now the rice-producing area cannot be self-sufficient, either the rice-producing area is suffering.</p>
<p>The power of hooligans and gangsters is the toxin that plagues Luodong's construction and security. It is extremely rampant, and residents are terrified. They have hundreds of disciples, carry sharp weapons, and act unreasonably, causing trouble everywhere. They collude with the local volunteer police team, forcibly occupy Japanese-owned houses, and arbitrarily oppress civilians. The district office and the police station are all worried about this. Especially the volunteer police team, which is manipulated behind the scenes by local thugs. There used to be more than 200 people, but after being disarmed by the National Army, there are only 70 or 80 people left to assist in maintaining local security, but their "maintenance" is not valued.</p>
<p>The district office is currently detaining more than a dozen bandits, three of whom have committed more than ten bloody cases. The district office has temporarily set up an electric wire outside the detention facility because they are afraid of prison break. The Taipei County Police Department has repeatedly urged them to interrogate them, but the district office does not dare to send them out with peace of mind, because they believe that after being escorted to the military court, they may be released on bail or have their sentences reduced. If this is done, the parties involved and the district office will suffer. And now the local people all hope that they will be executed on the spot. This kind of distrust of superiors is also a special phenomenon among the special phenomena in Taiwan province!</p>

<h3>The Directing Method of "Promotion Chart"</h3>
<p>— Tao Neng</p>
<p>The author of "Promotion Chart" deeply grasped reality and exaggeratedly depicted it using artistic techniques, making the theme of the play very obvious and its meaning quite profound.</p>
<p>The director handled this play with a "profound yet simple" method, presenting the play's content to the audience bit by bit, without any omissions.</p>
<p>When the curtain was raised, we saw a completely symmetrical scene: the door in the center of the back wall was pushed open from the middle, dividing towards both sides. A double sofa was placed at each stage left and right. An eight-immortal table was in the center of the stage, with a grand master's chair leaning against each side of the table. The lights shone from both sides, and the shadows of the tables and chairs fell towards both sides.</p>
<p>After that, the principle of the scene remained the same, but the form changed. The back wall was a "Taiping Tongbao" coin, and the square frame in the coin became the door in the center. The left wall was a huge silver chest, and the door of the silver chest replaced the door leading to the inner room. A large lantern with the word "Bribe" written on it hung on the right wall. The surrounding area of the stage opening was the edge of a banknote, and the word "Ten" could be seen on the edge of the banknote. The sofas on the left and right stage entrances were still present. After that, each scene change only involved the props in the center of the stage.</p>
<p>The director also used a symmetrical method for the actors' entrance. The most obvious scene was when they received the governor back. The actors entered in pairs from the back wall, standing on the left and right, and then continued to enter in this way. The governor sat alone in the chair in the center, and everyone else stood on either side.</p>
<p>Another scene: The governor and the magistrate got married, and the two pairs of newlyweds stood on small round platforms on the left and right, reading congratulatory speeches.</p>
<p>The above two scenes are examples of static symmetry. The director also used dynamic symmetry to handle the actors' movements on stage. For example: The governor is coming soon. The five bureau chiefs stood in a row, listening to the secretary-general's instructions. When the police reported that the governor was forty li away from the city, the five bureau chiefs turned around together and picked up the ten thousand umbrellas. When the police reported for the second time that the governor was only thirty li away from the city, the five bureau chiefs were so anxious that they had nowhere to go. They turned the umbrellas in their hands, moving back and forth, crossing each other one by one. This immediately created a mechanically chaotic stage, expressing the panic and anxiety of this group of bureau chiefs.</p>
<p>The director's handling of the actors' actions was also mostly exaggerated. For example, after the police chief presented his younger sister to the magistrate, he went out saluting all the way, ecstatic.</p>
<p>The twisting of Miss Ma's body and the swinging of her arms as she entered and exited.</p>
<p>The queue when opening the silver chest, the falling of a string of people.</p>
<p>The governor, shirtless and wearing a red bib, sat in the center of the grand master's chair, with one leg raised and resting on the chair, drinking tea with a small teapot in one hand.</p>
<p>The actors' speeches were also exaggerated. For example, when the attendants received gold bars from the magistrate and the bureau chiefs, they shouted in the tone of a waiter in a restaurant noodle shop: "Received two gold bars..."</p>
<p>In addition, the costumes of the characters in the play were all exaggerated: the shoulder pads were as high as camel humps, and the badges were as big as plates. In particular, the director of finance wore ingots on his head, banknotes on his body, and pockets full of exorbitant taxes on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The performance of this play was consistently exaggerated, but there was not a single place where we could see that it was uncoordinated. Even the makeup was like that. This kind of performance was the first time I saw it, but I think its performance was successful! It is the success of the director! It is the success of all the actors and backstage staff! It is also the success of the Shanghai Drama Society.</p>
<h3>Introducing the New Film "House of Loyalty and Righteousness" from China Electric Factory No. 2</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>"House of Loyalty and Righteousness," currently being filmed by China Electric Factory No. 2, is a narrative film about the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, in which the people firmly believe they can achieve final victory. The content describes the protagonist Hua Gengzhai's family's loyalty and self-sacrifice for the country, with three generations of grandparents and grandchildren enduring hardships and demonstrating unwavering loyalty.</p>
<p>This film is written and directed by Wu Yonggang, and the important actors include: Liu Qiong, Qin Yi (Qin Yi was known as one of the four famous actresses in Chongqing's drama circles. Because of her skilled acting and perfect stage appearance, she has a considerable number of audiences.), Fang Bo, Zheng Hui, etc. The set design is by Li Enjie. All are top-notch figures from Chongqing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>The plot is set in Shanghai under enemy and puppet control. Therefore, there are factual records of various atrocities during the enemy and puppet period. For example, the inhumane torture instruments in the No. 76 Devil's Den; such as: tying two big thumbs and hanging them on the beam; pouring cold water into the nose, using electric chairs, etc.</p>
<p>Rice cannot be bought in rice shops, and citizens go to the countryside to buy rice and carry it back. When passing through the blockade line, they are confiscated, extorted, and shot by the enemy.</p>
<p>People milling rice line up before dawn. When the rice shops open to sell rice, scalpers collude with puppet police to disperse the queues, line up at the front themselves, buy the rice and then resell it. The real ordinary people waiting for rice to eat cannot buy rice.</p>
<p>The Japanese arbitrarily rob people's belongings. Traitors arbitrarily squeeze good people. The actions of patriotic workers. The Japanese military police blockade areas, causing people in the blocked areas without stored rice to starve to death. Our planes bombed the enemy's airfield, and underground workers directed the bombing targets and fought with enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>These are all familiar to the citizens of Shanghai, and also the suffering they have personally experienced in the past eight years. Now that it has been made into a film by the Central Film Studio No. 2 Factory, it is worth our serious introduction and recommendation!</p>
<p>This film is being rushed to completion by the screenwriter and director Wu Yonggang day and night and is already half completed and is expected to be fully successful next month. Soon it will meet the Shanghai audience, making the first great contribution to the film industry after the victory and repatriation!</p>

<h3>Mei Lanfang Performs Commercial Plays Again</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhifeng</p>
<p>The three characters Mei Lanfang have already become a representative type of ancient Oriental beauty in most people's minds, and not just the name of an artist. I believe that many real ancient beauties may not be as beautiful as he performs on stage, and when he went to perform in various countries around the world before, artists from various countries unanimously acknowledged that his entire body movement conformed to the latest principles of aesthetics. Although they don't understand the singing skills of old dramas, when he performed in the United States, one day after he finished singing, the audience was greatly moved and applauded non-stop, and he had to come out and thank them, opening the curtain more than twenty times, breaking the world singing record. Can you say this is accidental?</p>
<p>Mr. Mei has suffered too much loss in the past eight years because he was unwilling to perform under the rule of the enemy puppets, because his burden is quite heavy - in addition to providing for three sons and one daughter to study, he also has many relatives and friends who also need his continuous help. Although he is very frugal and has no bad habits, this expenditure has been quite considerable during wartime when prices have soared. But where does this expenditure come from? Mr. Mei, being an artist, will not make a few wooden handguns to rob people, nor will he hoard goods for speculation and make money from national crises. He can only gradually sell his real estate, industry, calligraphy and paintings, and antiques. Now that victory has arrived, his little savings from singing plays for half his life are also gone. Even if we don't talk about promoting national essence or promoting art, just to solve personal economic problems, and for an old man over fifty years old to still put on makeup and perform, it is already very worthy of our sympathy. However, recently when he performed a commercial play at the Nanjing Theater, some people suspected that he was going to make a fortune. Of course, the highest ticket price is 12,000 yuan and the lowest is 3,000 yuan, averaging 11 to 12 million yuan per day, which seems to be quite considerable. But if we calculate carefully, the entertainment tax alone has removed half of it, and the theater rent is 2 million yuan per performance. Then, after removing the actors' salaries and the travel expenses of the actors invited from Beiping, as well as publicity expenses, how much is left? I think any reader can figure it out. With such a small income, it is really impossible to compensate for one ten thousandth of the loss he has suffered in the past eight years. Where can we talk about making a fortune? We only hope that he is healthy and can perform a few more times. In addition to being a pioneer in reforming dramas, it may be slightly beneficial to the old age of this generation of artists, so that they will not need others to provide relief in their old age like many artists.</p>

As for the actors, Tarzan is still played by John Weissmuller, and his wife, Jeannie, is played by Broda Jcyeu, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cured Third-Stage Lung Disease Patients Print and Send National Lung Disease Special Medicine Formula</h3>
<p>(Note) After receiving the special and wonderful formula for treating lung disease sent by Zhang Xixian, the director of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province, we immediately sent it to Mr. Chen Cunren, a consultant and Chinese medicine practitioner in this column, for careful study. Now, after Mr. Chen added annotations, he believes that this formula is indeed valuable, and it is specially published for patients to try. As for its effectiveness, we will still ask readers to provide practical experiment reports in the future. This is actually creating a new record in Chinese medicine. (Editor)</p>
<p>Original Letter from Zhang Xixian</p>
<p>The Only Wonderful Formula for Treating Tuberculosis</p>
<p>In the Western hospitals in Henan, this Chinese formula is used to treat tuberculosis, saving countless people. It was passed on to Xi'an, and also saved many people. There were reports published in the Zheng Bao on January 28th and February 22nd introducing it (Xi'an's famous Western doctor Wang Ziwei also proved the miraculous effect of this formula, and several of his friends were cured). Even third-stage lung disease can be brought back from the dead. It is truly a wonderful formula.</p>
<p>Mulberry Bark, Asparagus, Raw Rehmannia Root, Cooked Rehmannia Root, Donkey-Hide Gelatin, Ophiopogon Root, Safflower, Apricot Kernel, Fritillaria Bulb, Anemarrhena, Licorice Root, White Peony Root, Angelica Root.</p>
<p>A total of thirteen flavors, one mace each. Two mace each for those who cough up blood or are seriously ill. Use three eggs, cook them with the medicine, peel off the eggshells, use a wooden pestle to prick dozens of holes in the eggs, then put them back in the medicine and cook well. Eat the eggs first, then eat the medicine, on an empty stomach, both morning and evening are fine.</p>
<p>Attached Experience Gained</p>
<p>(1) Choose small, fresh eggs. Use a larger medicine pot with a lid. Put more water in it, cook it for a longer time, and cook it tightly covered. (2) At the beginning, you can take two mace each, one dose per day, and only eat the first decoction. Until the disease is slightly better, you can also take it every other day. (3) There are no restrictions on the time of taking the medicine. Both men and women, old and young, can take it. However, it is advisable to have a pure heart and few desires, and to cultivate well. (4) Take as much as needed until the disease is cured (or dozens of doses or hundreds of doses are fine). This is a kingly holy medicine that nourishes the lungs, stops coughing, resolves phlegm, nourishes the spleen, strengthens the stomach, removes filth and generates new ones. You can eat more of it. Even long-term cough can be cured. (5) Some people cough and spit more after eating ninety doses. Do not be afraid. This is a phenomenon of removing filth and generating new ones. Continue to take it, and the disease will gradually be cured. However, some people do not have this phenomenon. (6) Please print and copy more and give it to others. The merit is immeasurable, and it will benefit your descendants for generations.</p>
<p>[Dr. Chen Cunren's Note] Your office sent this formula and asked me to study it. After checking about twenty relevant medical books, I have not found this same formula. It should be a verified formula circulating among modern people. Its organization is a mixture of three old formulas: "Xie Bai San, Donkey-Hide Gelatin Decoction, and Ophiopogon Root Decoction." It is indeed a good Chinese medicine formula for treating the lungs. Its medicinal properties are nourishing, tonifying the lungs, increasing fluids, clearing heat, and nourishing blood. It is really beneficial and harmless for tuberculosis patients to take this formula regularly! According to my observation, this formula is generally more effective than cod liver oil calcium preparations in terms of nutritional treatment value for chronic tuberculosis. It is indeed possible to cure tuberculosis! However, chronic tuberculosis, its extent has gone beyond the lungs, such as combined pharyngeal paralysis (i.e. laryngeal tuberculosis), hemorrhoidal fistula (glandular tuberculosis), diarrhea (intestinal tuberculosis), etc., this formula is obviously ineffective. Also, acute tuberculosis, such as 100-day tuberculosis (i.e. miliary tuberculosis), this formula is also ineffective. Because this formula only has the effect of chronic nourishment, those who also have tidal fever and bone steaming, its progression is faster, then this formula is useless.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Tuberculosis is a common enemy of mankind in the world, especially a great disaster for the poor people of China. Patients have no special medicine to treat it, and can only listen to nature and wait to die. Therefore, the mortality rate of tuberculosis is increasing day by day, and the harm is so great that everyone knows it. After the end of the First World War, the number of people who died from this disease has doubled, which is truly frightening. Now, the Second World War has just ended. After the great soldiers, there will inevitably be epidemics. Among the epidemics, tuberculosis is the worst. The people's lives are more difficult, and the materials are more scarce. They cannot get enough nutrition to resist the invasion of diseases, and they spread from person to person until they cannot be contained. Therefore, countries around the world, in view of the terrible tuberculosis death rate of the First World War, have formed tuberculosis prevention committees, but since there is no special medicine to provide relief, it is difficult to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Fortunately, there is a Chinese herbal medicine miracle formula handed down in the world, which has saved countless people in the provinces of Henan and Shaanxi. It is truly the only savior for patients, and can also be the greatest help for tuberculosis prevention committees and Chinese and Western doctors. How dare you not make it public to the world to benefit the public? I hope that you gentlemen will have great compassion and sympathy, and publish it in a special column to spread the word, so that virtue will be bestowed on the masses and the merit will be immeasurable. Please do not treat it as unrelated news, or that other newspapers have already published it, and I can not publish it, and ignore it.</p>
<p>I have suffered from tuberculosis for four years, sometimes better and sometimes worse. I have recuperated in the quiet mountains and forests several times. I have been treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors. I have also eaten and injected precious medicines and injections. I have exhausted all my family property, and I can barely breathe, but the disease has not really been cured. Last winter, the disease broke out again, coughing up blood like a waterfall. The dangerous situation was even worse than before. The doctors were helpless, and the hospital did not accept me. Later, a friend told me about this formula. I took more than 20 doses in a row, and then I walked as usual. After more than 50 doses, I recovered better than before. Now I am the director of the Fengxiang Police Bureau. Wang Jun Zuyang also suffered from this disease and reached the third stage. Last March, he went to the Provincial Hospital for an X-ray, and the right lung tissue was completely destroyed. The disease was severe and he was on the verge of death. After taking this medicine, after several months, the disease has been cured. After examination, it has been completely restored. We are deeply grateful for our past suffering, so we sincerely broadcast this formula to the world to help the world. Now more than 200 people have been cured in Xi'an, and the price of the medicine is very cheap. Each flavor is two mace per dose, which is only more than 300 yuan, which is especially easy for poor people to take. How lucky!</p>
<p>Zhang Xixian, a third-stage lung disease cured patient, printed and sent it to the director of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province. Wang Zuyang, a third-stage lung disease cured patient, No. 9 Xuanfeng Bridge, Xi'an, and Wu Shaowen's nephew, No. 11 Daxiaozi Temple Street, Xi'an.</p>
