<h3>城郊附近據點被佔　共軍重砲轟擊大同　娘子關爭奪戰愈演愈烈</h3>
<p>共軍圍攻大同形勢圖</p>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕軍調部大同小組共方代表離城後，政府與美方代表以共軍攻打益急，安全成問題，同時亦失去談判對象，故呈准軍調部，昨已返平。大同城內十二日起，己落彈最多至十數彈，今晨據報，共軍十四日起開始全力進攻，城南七里村，城北十里之白馬城，城東五里之御河橋據點，均已失陷，臥虎溝車家莊今被圍攻，城東南六里之沙嶺共軍被擊退。惟大同生命源泉之飛機塲，已蒙戰火直接影響，飛機降落，失去安全。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十七日電〕此間軍方消息，包圍大同共軍，以重砲向市內轟擊，迄今已達第三日。乘飛機離大同之軍調部執行小組，業已遄返北平。據政府方面人士稱：共軍將不惜任何代價，以取大同，另有人謂，如國軍堅守大同，則雖在糧食及軍火缺乏之情形下，仍可支持一月。政府僅曾由空路運送少數援軍及糧食往大同，傳有政府援軍正自包頭開赴大同。軍調部執行小組曾在太原召集國共雙方司令官代表，舉行會議，企圖阻止戰事擴大，但無結果，傳共軍代表曾堅持國軍須先撤退晉南，惟此議爲政府代表所拒絕。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津十七日電〕此間報載北平訊：軍調部中共代表葉劍英，曾於軍調部政府，中共及美方代表會議時宣稱，中共對軍調部每週由北平飛往大同聯絡機之安全，不負責任。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津十七日電〕今日報載，第十二戰區司令官傳作義，昨日乘飛機赴大同，視察國軍防守情形，政府偵察機屢次飛經大同上空。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十七日電〕娘子關砲火速天，爭奪戰二日未停，雙方增調重兵，成決戰之局，共軍佔據多處山頭，以砲火猛攻，車站落彈極多，十六日曾一度攻至車站西揚旗外，迄晚戰事達最激烈階段，國軍已增援沿路佈防，確保交通綫，共軍於十五日將頭泌下盤石上安三車站攻陷，國軍增援後，已將三站相繼收復，惟路軌枕木均被毁，車站亦已成廢墟，共軍於娘子關南峪間，茲並以地雷大事破壞鐵路。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原十七日電〕交通界息，正太路被共軍破壞處，前正由太原與石家莊路局分頭搶修，預計週內可修竣通車，目前太原東行車，可至東趙，同蒲南段已修復，南下車可抵臨汾，惟南關富家灣間，須徒步連路約二百米，又運城風陵渡間路綫，前遭共軍破壞甚鉅，此間路局近接奉交通部令，重行整修，不足器材，將由交部撥供。</p>
<h3>美大使訪軍調部　聽取有關安平事件報告　對我國局勢將繼續斡旋</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕司徒電登大使，十七日上午赴軍調部，與饒伯森就安平事件及一般情勢長談二小時，中午應燕大校友歡宴，下午六時赴市府西花廳出席中美文化協會歡迎茶會，以該會副會長資格（會長張伯謹）作一簡單演說，述中美文化溝通之重要，而不涉及時局記者於會前提出數問題，承答如下：（一）來平後與馬帥無電文往還，（二）國共談判癥結在蘇北。（三）時局演至最後嚴重關頭，美對華政策可能變更，至如何變更，則將取決於美國國民。（四）大同或中原戰事雖烈，但尙未至完全失望。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十七日電〕美大使司徒雷登博士，十七日下午到軍調部訪晤饒伯森，鄭介民，葉劍英三委員，聽取有關安平事件之報吿。</p>

<h3>改組政府　當局研討中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕關於改組政府之事，一般看法均認爲政府早具決心，且勢在必行，至外傳以某部讓於某黨某派等傳言，未免捕風捉影，殊不足信，唯當局現正縝密硏討中。</p>
<h3>調查安平事件小組開始工作</h3>
<p>昨竟日聽取美方報吿</p>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕廿五小組十七日正式開始其調査工作，上午九時聽取執行部美方傳瑞茲少校之目擊報吿，傳少校七月廿六日因公赴津，廿九日搭美軍運輸隊車輛返平，途次安平，與輸送隊同遭襲擊，彼於報吿及答覆詢問中，證明輸送隊由津赴平，並無國軍協同或摻雜其間，且在遭受攻擊前，亦未有何部隊或個人與該隊進行交涉或阻止。攻擊彼等者，着軍服與着便服者，兼而有之，彼對一部攻擊者軍服之顏色，頗感無法說明，共產黨代表黃逸峯當時將自己軍服褲扣鈕開，露出裏面新灰褲，乃問是否此顏色，傳答「略淺些」，傳於答覆詢問中並稱：彼於安平事件發生前三天，廿六日由平赴津，經過安平鎭一帶，所乘吉普車，亦曾遭槍擊，彼等遂用機槍還擊，並發擲彈筒六發。下午二時小組繼續聽取執行部美方憲兵隊調査員丢克君之報吿，彼與傳瑞茲少校同爲安平事件之目擊人，彼說明當爆炸聲傳來時，運輸隊之手榴彈多在箱中，其車上之一架機關槍，亦無人能熟練運用。並稱：戰事一開始，美軍指揮官即陣亡，彼係於七月廿八日由平赴津，於雛黨溝附近亦曾遭槍擊，途中曾遇有帶槍便衣者立於路上，四時半後，小組聽取美陸戰隊第一營營長柏爾敬報吿，至五時餘散會。十八日將繼續聽取其三土兵之報吿，派往共產黨區之聯絡小組，五時已出發。</p>
<h3>葉劍英談話</h3>
<p>仍須爲和平努力</p>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕葉劍英昨晚與饒伯森同返平，今日接見記者稱：此次赴京係報吿安平事件，無其他任務。馬帥對安平事件態度極鎭靜客觀，並謂誰都不應該把事件故意宣傳，特別是不該作歪曲宣傳，馬帥對此事件未提具體方案，僅謂已看到調査程序，希望能迅速獲得協議。記者問，此次與馬帥是否談到執行部存廢問題，葉答：「我們根本沒有把這當成一個問題，仗雖然在打，我們仍須爲和平邀功」。彼更判斷在和平未獲致前，馬帥不致撒手。</p>
<h3>鄂國軍收復興山</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十七日電〕共軍羅厚福部乖第九及第卅二小組擬就臨時停戰協定，國軍終止軍事行動之際，突於十四日糾集所部五千人，攻陷興山縣城，並分路向　歸及香溪猛犯，國軍無備，被迫後退，直至昨午始將興山收復，現尙分路截擊中。</p>
<h3>民團奮起自衛　豫東共軍遭遏阻　精銳國軍已自洛陽東下</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕據今日由開封來京之軍界人士談，隴海東路開徐段，由蘭封以迄黃口一機，連日均有激戰，蘭封雖已被共軍攻陷，但由蘭封西進之共軍，頃已遭遇由洛陽東下精銳國軍之堅强抵禦，戰事正在蘭封附近東北面進行中。汴洛鄭各地上空，現鎭日機聲隆隆。衆信國軍可能於短期內收復蘭封。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕開封訊，自豫省府主席劉茂恩親臨豫東各地，指導加强各縣民團組織後，豫東各縣民衆自衛力量，更見堅强。據悉，僅蘭封一縣之武裝民團，已渝萬人，該縣民團刻正向豫魯邊區之山嶽地帶集結，準備截斷豫魯兩省共軍之聯絡錢，因此竄至隴海東路之共軍，恐後路被斷，已大起恐慌。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕軍息，共軍沿隴海路發動之攻勢，西起開封，亘五百里，動員軍隊十萬以上，開封東第一站之興隆，昨已被攻估，國軍尙據守之民權考城，及其他重站，均被圍攻中。此外，共軍楊勇亦率部三萬餘，目皖北開至碭山左右，與劉伯誠部會合猛攻中。</p>
<p>〔中央社開封十六日電〕豫保安副司令劉藝舟，今在記者招待會中稱，共軍整個戰略，爲華中流竄，華北正面作戰，李先念部之流竄，係牽制性質，劉伯誠發動豫東戰事，爲正面作戰，其兵共卅七個團，連民兵近廿萬人，楊勇九個團，其他不明，目的在（一）策應蘇北，（二）切斷隴海路，（三）奪取商邱，考城，民權，蘭封，得僊後，即擬進攻開封，刻我軍已開始反擊，其企圖決難實現。</p>
<h3>共軍空襲揚州外圍</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十六日電〕據揚州確訊電稱，國軍自打通揚大公路後，揚州外圍戰事，已趨沉寂，共軍於十三日乘國軍調防，特舉其大股全力，由邵伯高郵突擊送駕橋菱塘橋公道橋，該三地於十五日相繼被共軍佔領，十五十六兩日，由該三地流亡逃難至揚州者，約五萬人。扶老携幼，厥狀至慘，現蘇北難民救濟會揚州辦事處，已撥發賬款五百萬，辦理急賬。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕此間報載，共軍援軍十萬餘人已開到蘇北，圖向如皋揚州一帶國軍反攻。北軍新四軍軍長陳毅，曾於本月十三日召集蘇北區共軍高級將領至淮安司令部會議，準備反攻，目的在擊退如皋及揚州國軍。</p>
<h3>主席邀宴曾琦等　席間廣泛交換一般意見</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十七電〕蔣主席十七日下午一時，在官邸邀宴靑年黨領袖曾琦及該黨中常委劉東岩，並有陳立夫·朱家驊·王雲五·陳在雷·陳景韓·吳鼎昌等作陪。席間曾氏曾與主席等作廣泛之交換意見。此外，主席並詢問下部長關於工商業各問題及滬工商界請願團事，王氏均一一答覆，主席表示甚爲滿意。王部長並擬於不久將經濟部詳細施政向主席報吿。曾琦定十九日前離牯返京，但表示在下山前擬再謁主席，有所商談。</p>
<h3>對國大憲草諸事　左舜生表示意見　憲法上各問題應先解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨日午後往上海海格路靑年黨總部訪問靑年黨負責人左舜生，陳啓天兩氏，詢其對於國民大會憲草及政府改組諸問題之意見，承以書面答復如下：召集國民大會爲結束訓政實施憲政之必要措施，現在距政府所定召集國大之日期，不及三個月，轉瞬即屆。欲國大開會比較圓滿，必須從速完成必要之準備。所謂必要之準備，第一爲在國大開會前實現全國和平，使國大能在和諧空氣中順利進行開會，第二爲五五憲草修正案須在九月以內完成，以便國大制憲時有所依據。査第一次國民大會之惟一任務，爲制定憲法，並決定憲法開始施行日期，依照政協決議，須由憲草審議委員會依據憲草修改原則，製成修正案，提交立法院完成立法手續，再交國民大會決定。憲草審議委員會在重慶時雖已經有一個「五五憲草修正案草稿」，但尙未完全審議確定。吾人以爲完成五五憲草修正案，爲在國大開會前萬不可忽視之準備工作。宜從速恢復憲草審議委員會，繼續審議五五憲草修正案，俾其早日成爲定稿。憲草修正案中，雖尙有若干重大問題，如中央與地方的權限問題，立法與行政的問題，爭議未定，但條文大體已經草成，只須稍加整理，並本調和精神解決憲法上之各項問題，亦不難於短期內完工。如憲草修正案，懸而不決，則國大開會或仍不免發生爭議。我國過去爲制憲問題曾迭起紛爭，陷國家於長期混亂之中。今後欲制憲少起紛爭，必須從速恢復憲草審議委員會完成憲草修正案。至於政府改組問題，自須依據政協決議，於國大開會前，實行改組政府，以革新政治形態。參加之各黨派及社會賢　、務盡量求其具有全國性陣容，然後可以一新耳目，一致從事和平建國也。</p>

<h3>交通積極恢復中　興工程序決從幹綫入手　俞大維抵牯請馬帥贊助</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十七日電〕全國各鐵路交通積極恢復中　（一）膠濟路下月中旬可通車　（二）津浦路如無特殊阻碍，可望於國大會前全綫通車。（三）平漢·平綏·浙贛各綫，短期內可望次第恢復。</p>

<h3>「黑暗籠罩中國」　美輿論認使動干戈已不可免　中共報紙強調「戰爭」「進攻」</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕全面戰爭下的糜爛慘局，殆已爲不可避免，今日共方已不諱言「戰爭」與「進攻」等字眼。記者今午往訪軍調部共產黨發言人，渠以頗興奮態度介紹共產黨機關報解放日報昨日之社論，該論要求所有「解放區」軍民應認識今日局勢的嚴重，一致動員，「粉碎國軍」。並謂：只有戰勝國軍，才能獲得「和平」「民主」。此社論中除强調戰爭爲解決目前局勢之惟一方法外，並指摘「帮助與支持中國內戰者乃一貫的高唱調處圓滑的美國」。此文對於共產黨各種部隊之任務，亦有所支配。</p>
<p>〔本報特派員紐約十一日航訊〕紐約時報在其「黑暗籠罩中國」之一篇社論中，大意謂「馬帥及司徒大使發表聯合聲明，謂渠等發現無法使中國日益蔓延之內戰獲得和平解決，中國前途黑暗之寫照，莫此爲甚。五億人民由於兩敵對力量之領袖拒絕接受關於地方政府及軍隊整編之共同方案，而竟違反其意志，幷冒經濟完全崩潰之危險，從事狂妄之鬥爭。此對於世界谷地具有善意之人民自屬不可想像之事。黑暗顯然正降臨中國，幷使其陰影籠罩全世界。或許歷時已達九載之國共兩黨鬥爭中，欲實現和平，已不可能。或許似使世界陷於分裂之敵對觀念，使動用干戈已無可避免。或許馬帥之使命已確實失敗，中國共產黨能獲得成功。然可能尙有一種希望，即美國調停者之確實表示悲觀，及渠等所預料無可避免之事實，能使中國政黨領袖感覺其充分之責任而避免最後之災禍。或許渴望實現和平之中國人民之沉痛呼聲，最終得以穿過延安南京之強固牆垣。吾人遠在此間，如欲確定咎在何方，實屬無益。然重要之事實，爲國民黨政府代表中國五分之四之人口，蔣主席曾表示協調之傾向，然具有一定之限度，在此限度以外，則以此明智之領袖亦不敢多所冒險。共產黨亦曾尊重此項限度，然目前已越此界限而公然攻擊美軍。共黨以人數較少之集團，而要求在任何組織之政府中，獲得平等甚至超過平等之權力，同時在其目前控制之區域中，事實上實行自治，渠等對於否則無可避免之戰爭及紛擾似幷不恐懼。在此種對立之混亂局面中，馬帥已坦白承認渠之努力已吿失敗。吾人如一旦撤退對華之援助及指導，則此悲劇國家之前途，殊少希望矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十六日電〕中國方面傳來消息，指示此命運悲慘之國，已臨全面內戰邊緣。歐洲方面將來局勢，以視中國，較有希望。美國戰後大規模計劃之一即將宣吿失敗。美國政策如有轉變，則完全退出中國未始不可能，果爾，則中國抗戰十四年中，華人及其友邦所抱全部希望勢將隨之消逝。中國艱苦英勇抗戰所以能支持如是之久，大部份得力於此稱希望。全面內戰如不可免，則中國在政治經濟及思想上將成爲一眞空地帶，爭奪世界領導地位或圖稱覇世界之勢力，勢必向此眞空地帶乘虛而入，其中一部份勢力之被牽入或非出於始願。</p>
<p>首都街談巷議　責中共無誠意</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十七日電〕南京之街中人如商店朝奉，旅館侍役或菜館堂倌，今日無不以爲馬歇爾特使之使命已吿失敗，其原因則大部份歸之於共產黨之無誠意。一般人咸謂，「馬帥是能幹人，或即爲美國最能幹之人，不幸國共糾紛太深，無法消弭。共黨堅指馬帥僅代表國民黨說話，此爲其失敗之原因」。發表此種意見者，仍有一種牢不司破之觀念，以爲共黨之不能妥協，實受蘇聯勢力之操縱。惟信美國軍備軍火助長中國內戰者爲數亦多。忠心擁護國民黨者否認此說。多數南京人並信以眞正民選之官員組成立憲民主政府尙隱約在朦朧的將來，其來也不過有其名而無其實。此輩並謂國民黨應爲中國一大黨，但不應爲唯一政黨，他人應在政府中分得一杯羹。蔣主席仍不失爲國家唯一合理之領袖。（尙有中共發言人評馬帥工作之消息，請閱第二版）</p>

<h3>流通關內外商運　東北行轅經委會訂定四項辦法　並開放匯兌調節商貨</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十六日電〕東北光復一週年來，可資　　者，為欲　開通，關內貨運不絕。自客歲東北光復後，交通破　，政局朱定，東北人士日用所需均仰仗于過去積蓄及商販背携之零星貨物等現已有日漸缺欠之情形，行營經委會為謀打開非正常之經濟現狀，使關內外經濟合理打成一片起見，已自十五日起訂定流湧商貨辦法明種，計商貨出入　　暫行辦法，鐵路　車貨運暫行辦法，東北九省工商匯兌暫行實施辦法，及輸出商貨檢查暫行　　等，佈告商民週知。停頓　年之關內外貨運，由此可得暢通。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十七日電〕行較經濟委員會發言人對　話商運　　關內外上商匯兌　法，發表談話稱：東北自收復後，關外商運，迄未　復，困難所在，一為敵偽物資，未接收清點完竣，防止私運散失，次為車需緊急，商運輸出，不能不加限制，三為交通工具不足，四為匯兌尚未開辦，經委會急求對策起見，現長官部業已停止檢查商貨，軍運車輛，亦儘量　　，以充商運，現暫定四種辦法（一）關於輸出品之分類，輸出品中分為「普通」·「許可」·「特許」三類，「許可」及「特許」外，其他一切貨品，均為普通品，不加　　；（二）關於貨運先後辦法，機會均等，避免積壓，政府及工業　　，獲有優先權利，商民貨品，加其　質重要者，亦可取得同等權利；（三）此次所定檢查對象，僅欲商民證明貨品，並非私藏或偷竊敵偽物資，祗須有一舖保證明即可放行；（四）關於匯款辦法，過去東北對對關內匯款範圍，限於公款及公務員瞻家費用，現幣制漸入常軌，商運亦已開放，特依財政部頒行之東北九省匯兌暫行辦法，訂定匯款實施辦法，凡屬遵照商貨出入調解辦法辦理之正當商人，均得申請匯款，工業匯款在一百萬元以上者，及商業匯款之在五十萬元人上者，可向銀行申請，經銀行核認為正當者，即可結匯，匯率由中央銀行隨時牌示。</p>
<h3>共軍决運堤眞相　空軍總部駁斥共黨讕言</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕共產黨宣傅機關新華社，十一日曾發表政府空軍炸燬運河河堤，釀成蘇北水災之消息，意圖將此次蘇北施行之責任，嫁禍政府，記者為此，特趨訪空軍總司令部政治部發言人，詢其對新華社造謠中傷之惡意宣傅作何感想，承發表談話如下：此次新華社所揑造之虛偽宣傅，稍具政治常識者，均知純為共黨一貫之朦蔽政策，惡意造謠中傷，企圖將人天共憤之決堤暴行歪曲事實，轉屬責任於政府，而此次共黨不惜違背人道，決堤灌淹蘇北三百平方公里土地之陰謀作用，吾人可解釋為下列兩點：（一）邇來共軍在蘇北一再失利，陰謀未逞，為防止國軍繼續反擊，企圖挽回軍事頹勢起見，遂不得不於七月三十一至八月二日間，先後潰決運　河堤，造成嚴重水災，淹毀公路橋樑，圖阻國軍深人入。（二）共黨之一貫目的，即在以武力奪取政權，而其最大陰謀，則又為造成國家之普遍貧窮，破壞社會秩序，摧毀農村經濟，造成赤地千里，俾迫使受其暴虐統治之良善民眾，參加彼等組織，供作擴展地盤之犧牲品，此等卑劣之宣傳，災不値識者一笑也。該部並於十七日晚，對全國廣播，闡明決堤眞相，抨擊共黨謬論。</p>

<h3>中共發言人　評馬帥工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕共產黨發言人今晚正式表示，「檢討」馬帥調處工作之得失，並加以批評。發言人並否認此含有「攻擊」之意，共產黨此種舉動，顯係對馬帥以精神壓力迫使馬帥不得不就範，有利於共產黨片面之意見，以執行停戰協定，政協決議，整軍方案等四項協議，發言人指責馬帥，謂自去年十二月至本年三月之第一個時期，馬帥調處工作為忠實執行杜魯門聲明之使命，完成四項協議，成績逃惶，第二個時期自馬帥返美回程後，工作即偏袒一方，調處缺乏原則，未達到應有之努力，亦未奉行杜魯門之聲明，杜之聲明係三外長會議時同意者，三外長會議時，馬氏亦在塲。發言人對杜魯門之聲明，杜之聲明係三外長會議時同意者，三外長會議時，馬氏亦在塲。發言人對杜魯門之聲明，不能實行時，是否將提請安理會解決一事，無肯定之表示。共產黨希望馬氏繼續努力實施四項協議，忠實遵行杜魯門聲明。最後共產黨對馬氏個人及其已往成就，甚表尊重。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕共產黨已開始公開指責馬帥對國共調處之不公。據確息：在草斯科三久長會議時，莫洛托夫曾向貝爾納斯表示，由　蘇兩國代表會同國區雙方代表共同調處東北問題，以解決中國紛爭，因莫氏認為東北為中國問題之重心然當時貝氏並未表示意見，觀乎今日共產黨煽動反美與抨擊馬帥，吾人可知其動機已不自今日始。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>如何解決學生失學問題</h3>
<p>大巿政府前次記者招待會中，我們聽到了吳巿長對於本巿小學中學學生失學問題的談話，十分感覺其嚴重性。第一是生活高漲，一般私中小學校的學費將提高，收入微薄的家庭，勢難照常供給子女的讀書費用。現在距秋季開學時間，不過半個月，我們試聽着四周無錢的家長們，已是憂心忡忡地為了子女的敎育，幾乎寢食不安，走頭無路，第二，是學校的數量問題，上海公私立學校雖然似多，但勝利以來，四面八方的人，大家都扶老携幼跑到上海來，據吳巿長的報告，上海目前的人口，差不多已有四百五十萬人，學校數量少，學齡兒童的人數多，於是做家長或學生的，對於投考入學等手續稍一忽略，便有擯諸學校門外之虞。又為了考生多，每校的學額有限，錄取時不得不捎嚴，於是有許許多多落選的學生，也可憐地大有失學的恐慌。我們試看四周的無數青年子弟，現在正奔走於溽者之中，東也報名，西也報名，東也投考，西也投考，憂心如扩擣，為了取不取急得幾乎神魂顛倒，十分可憐。特別正値這暑假還沒有過去，學生入校動態適當紛紜衝蕩之際，我們可以非常清楚地看得出這個失學問題，確是相當嚴重的。</p>
<p>但從我們客觀方面看來，上海青年的失學問題，並不是絕對沒有辦法解決的。在目前急不容緩的時候，我們要有治標的辦法，在日後一切情形都好轉的時候，我們要有治本的辦法。敎育是立國的最重要的根本，上海是全國最大的都巿，本巿巿政當局，在失學問題上肯孜孜不息地加以研究，時時刻刻地表示焦慮，眞使我們同時也覺得有無限的關切。</p>
<p>關於治標方面，我們以為如把全巿的中小學校，分為三輪上課，無形中就可把學校的數量，增為三倍，這三輪，白天有二輪，晚上有一輪。白天的二輪上課制，當八一三後，國軍退出上海，敵人還沒有侵占租界以前，上海很盛行過一時。除家長方面對於年齡較小的孩子，為了在校時間稍短，不免因為要加以管理而稍感覺麻煩外，其他都沒有什麽問題。直到現在，聞尚有少數學校，還是這樣的上課。白天的二輪上課制，歐洲國家現在物採用的也不少。如刦後的波蘭，因校舍校具多被毀於砲火，學校就採用了這個二輪上課制度。至於晚間的一輪，英美各國，尤為重視，政府在法律方面，從不曾對在晚間上課的大學中學，加以保守的傅統性的歧視。現在美國要人中，有許多人是從夜校讀書出身的也不少。美國新聞處本月七日的紐約電，說道：「美國夜校協會調查設有夜課之學院，有四十所，顯示退伍軍人加入夜校肄業者，較之一年前，增多百分之一千二百三十七，全部學生之人數，亦較一年前，增多百分之五十。」那末，我們這樣一個窮國，為什麽不肯利用此夜間之光陰，不屑正視此夜間之讀書？這夜間的一輪，不費可少納，年紀稍長的學生還可在家中或其他地方，做一些工作，敎員方面如身體稍强的，也可藉此額外收入，補貼家用。總之，只要我們肯放棄成見，拋去傅統觀念，只要我們肯吃苦勞，實行窮辦法，大家集中精力來推行一日三輪制的敎育，一定可以把上海嚴重的失學問題，冲淡得許多。</p>
<p>可是我們並不是要永遠執行一日三輪制的在艱苦中求開展的敎育，我們同時還須定下基本的永久解決失學問題的辦法。以我們國家財政的困難，敎育經費的渺小，政府在經濟上，實無巨大的經濟力量，以包辦敎育，因此鼓勵社會公團或國民私人的普遍辦學，以幫助政府在敎育工作上的完成使命，在今後是千萬必需的。我們如欲達到此目的，必須大刀闊斧地改變方針，把以往所有麻煩，痛苦，束縛社團或私人辦學的瑣碎法令，一律痛快廢除。在現制度之下，政府對私立學校法令之嚴密，立案乎續之世界各國敎育制度，對於私立學校待遇之嚴密週到，中國可算第一，印度到現在還是英國的殖民地，但在印度辦學的自由，印度華僑類能道之。我們要普及敎育，要根本解決失學問題，除非政府確有全力包辦，否則如仍把熱心辦學者用特殊的眼光去看，將來很少有人肯拿出自己的精力，發神經病似的再為國家辦學。今天敎育當局對私校的立案，百般留難，是敎育界共知的事實，共感的痛苦。這種痛苦，茍一旦解除，加之房荒等情形，逐漸消滅，國家經濟逐漸改善，則全國學校，於獲得自由之後，一定會如雨後春筍，共同努力的，為上海，為整個國家，根本消滅失學問題，完成敎育建設之偉業。</p>
<p>要之，在中國目前和今後，我們要普及敎育，要提高敎育，不能不用此革命手段，不能不實行一些適應環境打窮算盤的新方法。若政府旣沒有魄力規定大量經費辦敎衣，却又不肯改變政策，那無異扼殺我們的青年子弟普受敎育的機會。我們以為今後國家敎育政策，除了集中精力選辦若干國立大學或省巿立中學，以資示範外，應該放寬尺度，儘量獎勵社會公立或私人設立各級學校，以補國立省立巿立之不足。而政府對一切學生之學業成績，應不問其學校之為政府設立或社團設立，或個人設立，一槪用公正無私的考試方法去衡量，合格者畢業，不合格者補習。中國向來的傅統，並不輕視民間私人的敎育事業的。我們還是主張用社會公立和個人私立的方法，來救政府官立學校數量不足之窮。改弦更張，今天正是時候！</p>

<h3>美準備致牒蘇聯　反對蘇控制韃靼海峽　土耳其與英美外交接觸頻繁</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據聯合社及路透社土京安加拉十六日電稱：土耳其政府答德蘇聯要求共同保衛韃靼尼爾海峽之照會，業已起草完竣，今日或明日即可交蘇駐土大使維諾格拉多夫。據可靠消息，土耳其將拒絕蘇聯要求，堅持韃靼尼爾海峽之管轄，完全應由蒙德婁條約機構決定。土耳其自接蘇聯要求後，即與西方各國密切磋商，美駐土大使威爾遜·英駐土大使凱萊·均與土耳其外長沙加接洽頻繁，法駐土大使馬格拉斯亦曾訪土外長商商談。</p>
<p>關於美國對此問題之態度，據聯合社舊金山十七日電稱：代理國務卿艾克遜今日宣稱，美國或將向蘇聯提出照會，對於該國要求修改蒙德婁條約由蘇土共同保衛韃靼尼爾海峽一事，聲明美國態度。艾氏並稱，美國將反對蘇聯此項要求。美國對此問題之政策已由貝爾納斯宣佈，即美國贊成蘇聯船艦無限制通過韃靼尼爾海峽，但反對蘇聯在海峽取得基地。但據聯合社華盛頓十六日電稱：此間一部份人士私下表示，蘇聯必欲在韃靼尼爾海峽獲得軍事基地，絕不願放棄目的，恐不易另覓折哀辦法。據倫敦十七日廣播：蘇聯眞理報社論擁護蘇聯之要求，謂爲保全黑海國家之重大利益，非黑海國家應即停止干涉海峽行政，蘇聯在黑海擁有最長海岸綫，對於禁止非黑海國海軍之　入，當然有最大自衛權。</p>
<h3>美民意測驗　主對蘇採堅定立場　深信蘇欲進而統治世界</h3>

<h3>科學家集倫敦研究長壽訣　男性可變爲女性</h3>

<h3>撲朔迷離的印度政局　本報編譯室（續完）</h3>
<p>難題：巴基斯坦</p>
<p>大英帝國眼看着印度問題，已到了非解決不可的時候了，正如權威的「論壇週刊」所說的：「這是我們以朋友的姿能撤離印度的最後機會了。」三月十五日，首相艾德禮在下院作了一個震驚世界的宣佈：「英現已畀予印度在英帝國內或英帝國外之完全獨立地位。如印度欲以自由選舉方式，切斷其與帝國之關係，英將協助印度完成此舉。三月廿三日，由印度事務部大臣勞倫斯，海相亞歷山大，和貿易大臣克里浦斯所組成的內蘭代表團，抵達印度。不幸得很，常獨立還祗是個遙遠的美夢的時候，國大黨和回敎聯盟已經劍拔努張，亂成一團了。雙方開始了激烈的爭辯，攻訐嘲笑，咒駡，恐嚇，甚至「不惜一戰」相要脅。對於這許許雜亂紛紛的主張，我們歸結起來，仍然不外乎兩方面，第一，在行政方面，國大黨主張一個自由統一的，包括各方面的中央政府，回盟則堅持要分治，第二，在制憲方面，國大黨希望在印度先成立一個單一的制憲議會，包括各方面，必須等議會不主張統一時，始允分治。回盟方面則以爲印度西北及東北各地應該實行分治，由回敎徒另行組織割憲議會，自行草擬憲法。</p>
<p>癥結所在，也仍然只是在這個永未解決的「巴基斯坦」。回盟方面曾處聲恫嚇，說「不分治，我們寗願內戰」。英國代表團到印度以後，提出了一個組織臨時聯合政府和允許於各省劃分回敎區與非回敎區的建議案。經過了多少次唇敝舌焦的會議和爭執，回敎聯盟始終認爲這仍然是一個印度敎徒多數統治的局面，堅持要實行自己「巴基斯坦」的分治主張。會議於是到五月十二日又無結果而散。</p>
<p>會議旣吿破裂，五月十六日下午，艾德禮首相在下院宣讀白皮書，公布對於印度問題的最新解決計劃，內容包括六點，主席的是成立印度聯邦，聯邦政府管轄外交，國防，及交通；設立中央行政機關及全印會議，重大議案，須經全體議員之多數通過，並須經國大黨及回敎聯盟兩黨每一黨之多數通過；政府其他方面之權力，授與各省，准許各省自行組織行政機關與議會。關於制憲問題，每一百萬人選出代表一人，所選出的代表分爲回敎，錫克族及一般三組，惟全印制憲議會的二九二席中，二一〇席應屬諸一般代表。在制憲會議這一點，上印度敎徒顯然地佔着很大優勢。對於這個白皮書，印度方面的反響仍然是一片亂糟糟。國大黨不願意參加這秋色平分的臨時政府，但贊同在比例上自己大佔優勢的制憲會議；回敎聯盟願意參加臨時政府，但反對這自己佔有少數的制憲會議。這最後的一次方案，於是又在這種情形下宣吿失敗，英閣代表團在六月廿九日離印回國。</p>
<p>合則成，分則敗</p>
<p>但在這個新方案裏，有一點頗耐人尋味，就是它明確地反對分治贊成一統。這是英國對印歷史上的第一次，它沒有袒護回敎聯盟。過去的任何一次，英國都是在袒護着回教聯盟，來削弱印度獨立運動的對外力量的。這一次，英國的確是抱着解決問題的決心來的。這約略的說起來，也有着多方而的原因，情勢使它不得不作如此的決策。一方面印度獨立運動的浪潮洶湧澎湃，處處都在使情勢走向一種激烈的革命的邊　，已經不是傳統的「拖延」政策所能够敷衍得了。另一方面，蘇聯在伊朗的活動以及伊朗西北角所發生的情况，使英國懷着一種深切的疑懼。當回敎聯盟正和國大黨爲了「巴基斯坦」問題爭得面紅耳赤時，回盟的一個領袖曾說，「我想北方鄰邦的蘇聯，必會爲我們的要求支援。」事實上，許多左派的靑年也都正在把眼睛望着北方。蘇聯的勢力如果通過伊朗，侵入波斯灣，首當其衝的印度的情勢，就將難以逆料。如果印度邊境的西北部又存在着一個如眞納所要求的「巴基斯坦「，那末情勢的複雜，自然就更難處置了。英國人極明白這一切，他們眼看着繼績的統治已無可能，那末今日和平地退出，（尤其是讓給較爲緩和的國大黨份子）究竟還能够保着一點商業和資源上的優越，否則如果等到那一天革命爆發，退出的時候就更要狼狠得多了。</p>
<p>英國人這次是決心要把問題解決的，但爲了印度內部兩黨的衝突，使一個極好的獨立機會，又復輕輕放過。正如尼赫魯所說的「半自由半奴役的世界，不應再存在了」，時代在向着獨立自由的方向走，但印度人民的本身，也應該要了解，內部的爭亂一日不息，獨立自由的希望將永遠難於達到。印度今日的目標，應該是一致地爲求取自己國家的獨立，不要讓內部的爭執和歷史性的仇恨猜忌，削弱了獨立運動的力量。一個國家要想從另一個國家的壓迫束縛下翻身，一定是合則成，分則敗。我們中國願見一個獨立·自由·强大。而愛好和平的鄰邦，印度的領袖們在此國家命運的十字路口，應該要能自己作明智的抉擇！</p>

<h3>楊文道寃獄求平反　法庭上怒罵賣國賊　兇惡獄卒　「十一號」其人　已難查究　楊建忠譚勝供詞推諉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕楊文道（見前圖）案於昨日下午三時半在高院刑庭重行開審，承審推事為王可權。除楊文道外，出塲之重要人物，有為楊義務奔走十年之律師唐懐羣，十年前為楊辯護之律師葛肇基，並有當年開審時證人楊建忠譚勝二人，至一度化名曹操擬潛離上海之曾元，則靜坐旁聽席中，而並未向法院報到。</p>
<p>王推事首向唐律師諭告，證人收押，於法無據，若欲控告此數證人犯偽證之罪，則應另向地檢處具狀。旋即傅訊楊文道，楊因神經極度緊張，雖力自鎭抑，態度仍不甚自然。楊稱，彼係洪順，同仁，同義，三「互助會」之負責人，此三會皆係慈善機關，成立多年。王推事即問，「這幾個會是暗殺機關罷？」楊答：「是慈善機關，曾在主管機關登記」。問：「照你說來，中山秀雄不是你殺的了？」楊乃慷慨陳辭稱：「中山秀雄的事，我的的確確完全不知道，我一生清白，在此國土重光之時，始得有表白機會。至此楊乃猛烈抨擊曾元楊建忠鄭惠民張財源譚勝等人，謂「請堂上注意，他們一輩人是在日本未來之前就做漢奸的！他們這些無恥之徒，自成團體，甘心事敵，在中華民國乾凈土上，時時以製造事件為事。即以本案而言，他們知道我是洪門弟子，愛國從不後人，就先把我作犧牲品，但我一人之生死雖無足重輕，而他們却一方面直接加禍於我，一方面間接加禍於中國！」</p>
<p>推事乃問，韓人傑克認識否？答否。問葉海生認識否？答葉係洪順會員，過從並不甚密。問，據葉口供，民國二十四年十月十五日曾在同義協會，拈國何人前往動手，結果為葉拈得，有無其事？答，完全沒有。問，「二十四年十一月九日下午八時，你和葉海生及傑克三人到北四川路，在挖洞的書本裏取出手槍交給葉海生是不是？」答「完全沒有。」問，「到了寶樂安路逢到中山秀雄，葉就跟進豐樂里，從旁將中山打死，是不是？」答，「完全沒有」。</p>
<p>楊於述及其蒂蒙牌手槍係當時公安局秘書長李暮借與，供自衛之用，因家中小孩頗多，恐生意外，遂從楊建忠之言，將書本挖空，納槍其中，以策安全，此書本係英文本，而其後審訊之時，法院所示則已一變而為中文書。</p>
<p>問：「捕房打過你嗎？」答，「打得利害，自偵查庭後，毒打直到判死刑始止，每天午夜，輙打至天明，我跪在地上，日警就脫下皮鞋打我，口口聲聲，要逼我招認是拿了吳鐵城巿長十五萬塊錢，叫我打死中山秀雄，但我寗死不從，死而復蘇者數次，後始知左胸肋骨已斷。」至此，法官曾葉海生實地表演事，唐律師辯稱，此時係為敵海軍陸戰隊數百人包圍中「表演」，實不如稱為日人「導演」尤妥也。</p>
<p>於是庭上乃傅訊證人楊建忠，楊寶為楊文道之族姪，衣白紡綢舊西裝，黃色皮鞋，神色頗為頹喪。庭上問如能覺悟，則法院當可不究旣往。而楊建忠乃將所有責任，儘量推諉於其已死之堂弟楊桂梅，並謂彼本人與楊文道每一二月祗見一面，楊文道家中亦未去過。庭上乃問，「你旣與本案無關，何以案發後又圖逃走」？答，「因見大美晚報曾登過，開庭時曾問楊文道謂「楊建忠已走否」？故不能不走」。</p>
<p>楊文道乃稱，楊桂梅於二十五年四月十五日曾誑告北山同鄉會傢俱搬走，囑彼離開，實則全無其事，曾為楊文道之門口即時有形跡可疑之人往來矣。</p>
<p>四月十九日晨十時，楊文道出門時，即見譚勝，招呼便衣日警，將其挾上汽車，逕往狄斯威路捕房。</p>
<p>此時，唐律師突然起立，聲稱譚勝現在庭上，王推事乃傅喚，而此身穿破舊香雲紗衫褲，赤足靸鞋之「證人」，遂出現於全塲旁聽者之前。</p>
<p>譚勝稱，彼素與楊文道相識，楊係彼之「犬哥」。彼本人向在江灣復旦大學設食品攤，每日九時必至德勝里李樸家中吸食雅片。內有一「東洋鄭，」探問楊文道踪跡，同在一處吸烟之王姓者即謂「譚老勝認識」，一小時後，即有日人再來詢問，烟窟中四人盡被帶至狄斯威路捕房，當日下午即傅問，謂不說即打，而彼遂將彼等引至楊文道家門口。</p>
<p>推事問楊文道，對證人有話說否？楊忿怒已極，竟痛罵譚勝謂「我只要說他們這些人是害人的賣國賊！」譚勝情急，厲聲答曰：「我是被日本人壓迫，沒有辦法！」</p>
<p>此時唐律師即提呈張澧浦少將為其弟張琛慘死要求申寃之狀，庭上因事關檢舉漢奸，囑送高檢處。楊文道因又提及昔年幽囚西牢時，有十一號看守，每一見彼，輒肆毒打，要求查究。法官答謂已無從查考，並囑補遞有利證據，俾得繼續調查。</p>
<p>昨日本案審判時，楊文道係以粵語作答，而由昔年為楊辯護之葛肇基律師代彼譯為國語。葛氏因唐律師已遞狀為琛雪寃，遂欲以證人身份發言，庭上以其旣任翻譯，不宜作證，未予許可。然葛律師因當年承辦此案，曾被日人威脅，限其於二十四小時內離滬，後竟被迫出亡，乃仍侃侃陳述，並謂張琛良心發現，為楊文道證明無罪，遂終為會元所害。情緒激昂，反身戟指　觫於旁呼席上之曾元曰，「賣國賊！」全塲駭然。惟此自稱「曹操」且圖遁港之「證人」，雖亦在塲，而竟以未向法院報到之故，法院亦並未傅訊，是以此已被檢舉之漢奸嫌疑犯，乃仍以證人身份，安然步出法院門外。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕南京路沙利文糖菓公司因勞資糾紛，於十五日正午起暫停營業，職工二十餘人，俱枯坐店堂中，靜待解決。綠該公司自七月八日起，由郁信根向沙利文糖果麵包廠承包復業，當時職工因俱已服務十餘年以上，要求按照戰前待遇給薪，賣方始終以營業毫無把握為詞，一再遷延。致成僵局，現已呈報社會局請求照解去。</p>

<p>關於此次糧貸舞弊案，楊稱：我尊重國法，尊重糾舉。本人素為一奉公守法之公務員，三月十四日赴美時，當時糧貸辦法尚未有核定，是否舉辦亦正在決定中。抵美後，與國內消息甚為隔膜，至後忽接獲糧食部來電稱：地院為糧貸舞弊寧欲傅我訊問。得此訊後，大為驚異，怱怱回國，方知此事。今該案尚在偵查期中，本人不願多言，還請原諒云。</p>

<h3>原告發人曾元　又被檢舉漢奸　密告敵憲殺害楊案要證張琛　被害人之兄來滬伸寃</h3>
<p>在開審以前，唐律師很興奮地告訴記者：「這件案子，大槪是勝利以後漢奸案外最大的一件案子了罷？」</p>
<p>他說，昨天清早，突然有一位張　浦少將，從南京趕來找他。這位張將軍是黃埔四期畢業的，他的令弟却就是楊文道案要證之一的張琛！據這位張將軍說，這位張琛因為楊文道證明被寃，為告發楊文道的曾元所忌。日軍佔領上海之後，張琛已任軍委會忠義救國軍總指揮部充少校軍需，在民國卅一年滬充局本部直轄上海行動隊少校情報組長，不想他雖知曾元和他有仇。却與曾元的小姨姚劍英過從甚密，結果曾元報告了日軍，張琛就被處死了。</p>
<p>張　浦將軍已經具狀檢舉曾元犯漢奸罪，在昨天開審的時候，唐律師曾將檢舉狀當庭呈遞。曾元正坐在旁聽席上，看見唐律師突然來此意外之筆，立刻四肢寒顫，臉色如土。放在膝蓋上的一頂舊草草帽，也差一點掉下地來！</p>

<h3>倉庫紗布堆積如山　均屬民脂民膏應速處理　清查團對兩處失火甚注意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕接收清查團視察敵偽倉庫，已於昨日開始。上午九時該團吳委員望伋。張委員慶楨由敵偽產業處理局組長張熙及江海關稅務司錢宗起郭有容陪同出發，分別視察百老匯路公和祥碼頭倉庫，楊樹浦浦碼頭倉庫，招商局北棧倉庫，及江灣其美路日軍馬廐倉庫等二十餘處，茲將各倉庫視察情形分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）公和祥碼頭倉庫原有倉房三十二所，皆貯存敵偽物資，現已有三十一所發還業主，僅有一所尚貯存軍用品如鋼盔，掃雷貝，帆布帳幕，炸藥，廢舊槍炮及油墨等物。（二）招商局北棧倉庫，原有倉房二十六所，現已騰空者二十四所半，尚有一所半貯存軍用品如軍服，軍鞋，砲彈壳，子彈等，然皆屬零星小股。（三）上海倉庫原有倉房十四間，現尚存有敵偽物資者約佔半數，均為紗布，報紙，肥皂，人造絲，脚踏車等物，其中棉紗棉布堆積如山，價値自極可觀。（四）黃浦碼頭倉庫，前所存者僅殘餘之日軍輜重及兵工用之刀鏟等等類物品，大部均已出空。（五）公和祥K字倉庫及其美路馬廐倉庫，曾於本年二月九月先後遭火焚燒，前者損毀行總之機器甚夥，後者本堆置食糧，致玉蜀黍數百萬包，俱遭焚毀，清查團刻正向處理局查詢二處起火眞相，及善後處理情形。吳張兩委員於視察後對記者表示：現各倉庫所存敵偽物資，雖僅屬一小部份，然為數仍然可觀，此種物資實盡為我民脂民膏，或發還或標售，宜速作處理。又稱各倉庫自由江海關接收加以整理後，現均備有清册可查，管理亦較前嚴密。據江海關方面表示：如現存各倉庫之軍用品，各有關機關能立即移去，則下月底可全部出清，又供商用及行總使用。唯所有敵偽物資，勝利後多轉輾移交接收，難免有零亂遺漏等情，兩處失火倉庫，清查團亦甚重視。唯據處理局方面表示：公和祥K字倉庫曾向中央信託局保有火險三千萬元，火災後即得如數賠償，被焚毀後之廢鐵亦售得二千餘萬元，故此倉庫失愼後，共得款五千餘萬元，實未吃　。其他各倉庫，將於明日繼續視察云。</p>

<h3>公債不受法院判决影響　黑巿漲風已急轉　投機盲從者可以醒矣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公債　動兩日後，多方業已完成目的，氣象略轉，昨巿人心復稍空虛，多頭紛紛了結，雜牌更為怯軟，統丙自晟開一六〇〇元賣價起，盤旋而降，中途略多掙扎，近午退至一一五〇元左右，始轉平定，甲乙自七〇〇元步落至六〇〇元以下，丁種自九〇〇元降為八〇〇元，戊種自一〇三〇元退至九〇〇元，結果與前收相較計甲乙跌二五〇元，丙種降三百元，丁戊各跌四百餘元。</p>

<p>外幣美鈔被變更匯率之謠所激漲，晨開二五六〇元有求，開後即遭買戶所包圍，而升至二六一〇元，此時與金巿同趨盤旋，在二五九〇元左右略費掙扎，終以金融帮納胃甚股，廣帮不斷套買，午刻猛升至二七〇〇元高價而後起一七〇元，港幣繼續受散戶吸收，自五七〇元升至五八〇元以上，結果較前收又漲十三元，港匯受申電報一八二元半之牽制，仍報五五六元，印匯六六八元，英匯八千九有供給，美匯仍乏變動。</p>

<h3>稅局辦事迂緩　巿商會電請改善　戰前稅單當日可發　現在須遲至一星期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巿商會為請令貨物稅局恢復當天塡發棉紗稅單事，昨電財政部，略稱：據本巿毛巾被毯工業同業公會函稱：查棉紗直接織成品裝運出品，例須將原定棉紗出廠稅單，送至貨物稅局塡發運照，方能出口。此項眞照辦法，在戰前當天即可發出，現則明定三天，實際須遲至星期，甚或過之。近來外埠船隻旣少，船期距離又遠，因發照之遲綏，每致延誤船期，不易運出。資金週轉，更大吃一感困難。請為轉呈財政部，令行貨物稅局，恢復戰前當天塡發之辦法，以利工商等語到會。查戰前統稅局塡發運照，當天即能辦出，工商稱便。該局戰後復設，迄將一年，內部機構，當已逐漸組織完整。所有戰前一切便利商民之良好辦法，自應力謀恢復，以期官商之間，免除隔閡。加連商貨流通，即所以裨益國家稅收，仰祈鈞部令行該局，妥籌速辦。</p>

<h3>紗漲布跌</h3>
<p>昨日紗巿堅定，津廣兩帮零星交易頗不寂寞，二十支紗普遍土升二萬左右，以紡建出品之日廠老牌廿支最俏，四十二支雙股綫因上日紡建只有筒子紗供售，同行俱抱向隅，是以昨綫價跳四五萬元之巨，蓋搜求頗不乏人也。</p>

<h3>白煤塊猛漲</h3>
<p>煤巿白煤塊，看顧經採辦商關住後，日來巿上現貨流出奇缺，故同業需購者祗能抬價競買，行情普遍直綫犯漲，白煤小子亦因缺貨，並呼煤店門銷頗為暢達，價隨塊煤同時上升，白煤層其大宗銷路為製造煤球，近因煤球受煤汕等液體燃料暢銷，銷路頗受影響，故行情仍站原盤。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局人壽保險處，為保障國民生活起見，特舉辦物價指數團體壽險。該局為使各界明瞭該項團體壽險之功用，特於昨日下午三時，招待新聞界。由該局經理羅北辰首述人壽保險之重要性，旋即分數點節使特價指數團體壽險辦法：（一）動機：（甲）對外界則純為保障國民生活而來。（乙）對該局本身，則為開闢壽險新業務。（二）原則：係以最小之代價，博取最大之收穫。務期該項壽險辦法，合乎經濟原則。（三）設計經過：該局曾較弱計劃稻麥，黃金，美金，外滙比値等壽險辦法，卒未果行，終於創辦物價指數壽險辦法。（四）特點：（甲）以生活費指數單位，為保險單位，被保人之保額，可隨生活費指數之漲落，自動增减。（乙）無性別之分。（丙）無職業之分。（丁）無身體强弱之分。（五）手續極簡，各機關社團，如欲投保，只須去函該局。待該局覆函承認，即發生效力。塡報表格，待後補行。保險費一律照保額千分之二計算，按月收取。（六）被保人之保額，可高至十個「生活費指數單位」，或五百萬元。並可每月變更，適應需要。被保人如不幸身故或殘廢，立即照章賠款。</p>
<h3>麵粉出口　巿商會再電請求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巿商會為據天津糧商公會轉請弛解滬粉運津事，昨又電呈政院及糧部，請弛麵粉出口禁令。原電略稱：（上略）按照目前情形而論，滬廠麵粉產量，可有每日十萬餘包之過剩。津巿方面，又需南粉北運。解禁則兩有裨益，維持原令，則滬巿粉廠津巿民食，均有妨碍，情勢至為顯然。即為滬巿民食起見，亦應以麵粉產量，與滬巿就地銷量是否平衡為斷。今每日旣有十萬餘包之過剩產量，即是為民食有餘之明證。應請鈞院部採納京滬兩地工商之建議，准將麵粉報運出口，實為公便。</p>
<h3>中砂白復昂</h3>
<p>昨糖巿因公司配與行方之生砂，本有供給三萬包之希望，但結果以四七折實配一萬四千一百包，故中砂白復見上展，已恢復原價，可見供額之多寡，與升降大有關係，其他土糖高貨亦緊，下檔平平，潮青以甬帮續有進採，上提青開至十萬，次之九萬八千五百至五千五百元，計百餘包，棉赤五六十包，十二萬五六千元，興化白十四萬一千五百元至二千元，興化赤十一萬七八千元，成交百數十　，油包什路青九萬元。</p>
<h3>木材呆疲</h3>
<p>木材巿況呆疲，現洋松進口頗多，因而巿價回下，惟因堆棧，上力等雜費，支出浩大，價亦不致慘瀉，現巿塲上每有大量船邊交貨拋出，價比巿售便宜。</p>

<h3>今日的隴海鐵路</h3>
<p>— 西安三日航訊　特約記者李馳</p>
<p>全綫復軌工程業已竣工。天寳段通車有待。天蘭段在着手。京陝直通車在籌劃中。</p>
<p>隴海鐵路是我國唯一的走向東西的鐵路，西起自甘肅天水，東迄江蘇海州，貫通了西北高原和淮河濱海地帶。隴海鐵路局——這條鐵路的首腦至今尙在西安，因爲位置過於偏西，不久將遷往略近於全綫中點的鄭州。在復員期內，隴海鐵路正發揮着鉅大的運輸量，過西安的車箱，無論東行西往，客與貨同樣的擠，不進去的被擠在車箱頂上去了。</p>
<p>塌方可望減少</p>
<p>話得由西邊說起，由天水到寳鷄這一段，在抗戰末期着手興築，直至今春始行通車。因爲臨時趕工，器材又不充分，所以工事馬虎，離開工程標準頗遠。尤其是開山的坡度不足，天一下雨，蹋方頻繁。蹋下幾千方的黃土當「家常便飯」，甚至上萬把「土方」的傾塌也不算稀奇。因此路軌雖然辛辛苦苦的舖好，而幾個月來，能通車的日子顯然比不通車的日子少得多。其實遠在去秋抗戰勝利日之後的不久，洛陽至潼關之間一段路因欠缺人力物力，遲遲未着手復軌工事，反而在那時趕築西端「天寳段」，好些鐵道交通的「內行人」，就曾經指摘當局措置之顚倒緩急的不當，他們預料到因「塌方」而引起的結果，因而主張停止舖設「天寳段」把那方面的器材東移，立刻趕修「潼洛段」，以應復員急需。到而今，「天寳」和「沌洛」兩段雖已先後完工，但通車成積證明了未被採納的這個建議倘若實施，可能减少許多損失。</p>
<p>天寳之間的二十七公里處和第廿七號山洞，最近又塌下巨量的工方，每一處都在一萬多「方」，沿途零星的塌方尙有多處。車停了。據路局方面預計，要到八月中旬才有希望全部淸除通車，但若遇雨天，那就不能不再延遲些了。幸而九月以後雨量漸减，今後可望塌方較少。蘭州與天水之間的路基土方工事業已動手，天寳段如能暢通，有助於天蘭段工事的進展。</p>
<p>成同支綫概況</p>
<p>寳鷄是川陜公路與隴海鐵路的啣接點，大半年以來，無數坐不到長江輪船的重慶客，已由寳鷄換乘火車東歸，一路上行旅擁擠，不下於十年前逃難西來時的情况。</p>
<p>長安縣的西鄰是咸陽縣，隴海鐵路在咸陽有條「咸同支綫」，直達長安之北約二百華里的同官縣，這是一條在抗戰中增築的新鐵路，主要用以運出同官煤鑛的煤，供鐵路本身和沿綫民用。同官一共有五十多個煤礦，其中七家兼有機械掘鑛設備，每月產量共達五萬噸左右，然而合計火車及獸力人力所運出的每月僅及二三萬噸。月初該支綫曾因山洪而損毁的一座鐵橋，一月前已經修復，當晚西安電廠才恢復照常供電，其前一共停電二十多天。刻下市內煤價亦已漸見下跌，但每噸仍在十四萬五千元之閒，而在鑛塲僅售三萬七八千元而巳。路局方面刻正擴大該支錢中途一個山洞，務使大型機車能够進出，如此運輸量將大爲增加，對於礦山與沿綫民用，惠益不淺。這山洞動工已達兩年之久，最近才打通了，已知工程相當大，順便一說：筆者最近看到幾種上海新出版的中國地圖，都遺漏了這一條支綫，甚至有一册把「天寳段」路綫還當作未完成鐵路，這種錯誤，似難原諒。</p>
<p>全綫直達洛陽</p>
<p>鐵路再從東走，就到豫陜交界的潼關，它在抗戰中熬受過一段最黑暗的日子。隴海鐵路在那兒要穿進一條隧道，即所謂第十七號隧洞，東來的車才入「關」到潼關縣城。在最吃緊的時日裏，火車祗能夜間開行，滅了燈，關上窗，在黑漆漆的路基上爬動。潼關對過黃河就是風陵渡，敵兵所構築的砲兵陣地，至今尙有遺跡。當年敵人砲兵曾由那兒瘋狂地發砲，瞄準潼關來射擊，假如洞口中一彈，那就可以斷絕當時吃緊的軍事運輸與一般還輸，而减低了隴海鐵路在抗戰中所發揮的功績。幸運得很，第十七號隧洞直至戰爭結束，祗曾受到砲彈炸裂的劇烈震動，洞壁發生裂痕，然而列車仍可通行，不過從工程學的計算上看，危險是危險了。</p>
<p>去秋勝利後，隴海鐵路當局由潼關往東修築，修理第十七號隧洞當然亦在計劃之內。後來因復軌工程吃緊，而且若然立刻澈底修理這隧洞，必然影饗到修路器材的東運，直至最近全綫已直達洛陽，才舊事重提說要動工修理。</p>
<p>勘測三條路綫</p>
<p>問題接着發生，修隧洞，必要在舊洞道之外另築一條臨時的便道，來代替隧道內在修理中的一段鐵軌。隴海路局勘測了三條路錢，其中兩條要穿過潼關城鎭鎭內，一條則由西門外繞過北城牆接上東站。這三條綫都經過許多民房，必要拆毁讓道，才能實現。潼關這小城在過去曾沾過隴海路許多光，鐵路曾帶給它以戰時的繁榮，但縣城居民聽到鐵路改道的消息，早在去年，就羣起反對，雖然路局方面已電請交通部按最高地價，分爲甲乙丙三等，發價收購便道所佔有的地段，而且價錢也出得很高，但縣民方面仍然反對，說「如果城內再修便道，則潼關中心區等於毁滅，潼關縣關鎭人民，定予力爭到底，決不貪圖高價」。旣承認「高價」，而仍不心服，想必情屬不得已之極。居民方面代設計另一條路綫，由西便經過北城牆外至東關，全程不過比上述第三錢長了百餘公尺。</p>
<p>籌劃全綫通車</p>
<p>戰時受毀而勝利後最先修復的是潼關到　夜鎭這一段，其後展修至陜縣，陜縣到洛陽之間，由東西兩端分別搶修，挪借其他路綫的鋼軌，辛辛苦苦，到上月初才吿一段落，勉强通車。其間所挪用的鋼軌，據說輕重畏短不同的共達五十餘種之多，工業器材因不能標準化而引起的損失，這應該是一回深刻的敎訓了，陜洛段觀音堂與硤石驛之間有大橋（即第八號橋）一座，修復工程異常困難，前後經過五百餘工人三個多月的趕工，徵發沿綫所有巨型木材和「聯總」所供給的洋松木，到七月底才吿竣工，日內正式試車，若然良好才正式通車。恐怕總不出道幾天的事了。這是隴海路全綫復軌工事最後的一幕。說快嗎，距抗戰勝利日快到一週年了。</p>
<p>第八號橋通車後，陜西到洛陽就可以直通，不必像現在半途要換一次車了。洛鄭間通車情形尙好，鄭汴之間有兩條路可走，其一是繞道新鄕，再經新鄕與開封間一條便橋越過黃河；另一條是鄭汴之間直接通過中牟黃汛區。上月因爲黃水漲，新汴便橋交通一度中斷；中牟鐵橋亦早因黃水而自動拆下，直到七月下旬，這兩條路綫才恢復，不過要用船渡聯絡。詳細情形已越出記者報導範圍以外，茲從略。</p>
<p>最後想向京滬讀者報告的：隴海路局正在籌劃全綫直通車，廢止現在的分區行車制（現在一個由天水到海州的旅客，要在途中買七次票，換六次車！）並且還打算與津浦路南段聯運，編成京陝直通車。到秋後黃水消退中牟鐵橋再度修復後，就有可能實現。這是一椿非常有益的計劃，無論對於復員工作和西東行的貨運。</p>

<h3>亞洲勞工會議應的準備</h3>
<p>— 周尚</p>
<p>今日的世界幾成爲勞工世界，將來世界的問題恐將多爲勞工問題。勞工問題是產業革命以後的產物。勞動者與資本家短兵相接，已形成現代社會無可避免的事實。資本家要保守其「旣得權，』勞動者要獲得其『生存權。』勞工問題確爲一個重大問題；這問題不解決，其他一切問題也難解決，而且將使世界上永遠永遠有煩惱和紛擾。</p>
<p>國際勞工局認爲亞洲勞工具有特殊性，乃於本年五月十九日邀請我國及其他有關係國，商討來一個『亞洲勞工會議。』商討一開始，便有會議地點的爭執，印度代表要求在印度開，我國代表自然要求在中國開，辯論了一下，於是規定一個執中的辦法，議決明年一月在印度舉行預備會議，後年在我國召集正式大會。</p>
<p>現在距離預備會議只有四個足月，社會部爲着準備工作，最近組織「亞洲勞工會議準備委員會，」構這會的份子是各有關機關高級人員和專家學者。這委員會的組成，在時間上似乎已感嫌遲，所請的委員在專家學者方而也還不够普遍，機關代表因爲不是由機關選出，並且有些不是主管的人員參加，恐怕將有隔靴搔癢之惑。然而已有這一個準備，不潦草，不馬虎，確是難能可貴，畢竟中國官塲大有進步了。</p>
<p>亞洲勞工會議被邀請的國家，定爲中國·印度·暹羅·菲律賓。至於朝鮮·馬來·安南·緬甸·爪哇·錫蘭·等究應派代表抑或僅派顧問猶未確定。美英法澳荷紐西蘭等與亞洲有密切關係究應如何參加，尙在研究中。我以爲朝鮮馬來諸邦，絕對絕對需要他們有代表出席並有表決權，英荷諸邦只可邀請爲觀察者，（Observer）請他協助指導並聽聽這會議的呼聲。澳洲萬不能正式列入這個亞洲會議裏面，一則地理不同，澳洲本身即爲一洲，若併入這次會議，不免有『名不正』的遺憾，二則他們勞工的標準很高，在一起相提並論，似乎有些格格不相入。亞洲近東各國如阿拉伯·土耳其·阿富汗·伊朗等國必須有代表與會，目前尙未列入，必須力爭。我們復盼望蘇聯也有觀察者加入，來看另一面的勞工。凡此提議。應由理事院授權小組委員會決定。我國已被推爲該委員會委員之一，將如何善盡委員的責任，更將如何爲亞洲弱小民族的勞工們造福？</p>
<p>預備會議的議程分爲四種；（一）社會安全的組織，（二）一般的勞工政策及其執行，（三）公約及建議書尙未經有關各國批准實施者所定社會標準的分年實施計劃，（四）社會政策之一般經濟背景包括工業化等問題。這四大問題中，背後藏着許多許多錯綜複雜的問題，而亞洲勞工的特性似乎還沒有全部講出。</p>
<p>我以爲亞洲勞工問題與歐美不同的特殊性質有二：一爲殖民地式的勞工，一爲華僑勞工。亞洲各地產業落後，外來經濟侵略，實業窒息得無法發展，戰後則外貨如潮湧來，嚴重性益甚。因此，亞洲勞工問題不僅是一個單純的經濟問題，或是政治問題，或是政治與經濟問題，實是民族政治經濟三個問題的綜合體。亞洲的勞工問題實已與民族問題不可分開，欲從國際資本主義壓迫下解放出來，惟有民族問題的解放才有勞工問題的解放。</p>
<p>華僑勞工又與殖民地勞工有密切連帶關係。殖民地土人多的地方，必要的勞工當然可以利用土人的勞力，但土人尙未開化，還是經營幼稚的自治自給的經濟生活，則其勞力不適合於殖民者的資本主義經營的目的，所以不能依照自由契約的原則，而往往用直接或間接的强制方法。在土人少而效率不高的的殖民地，不得防遏土人的移出，促進外國勞動者的移入。處於殖民地勞動政策的特徵下，我們的華僑勞工便變成犧牲者。</p>
<p>强制勞動最極端的是奴隸制度，一面是使土人奴隸化，同時更由外部輸入奴隸。外來的奴隸與家畜一樣，只是勞力的供給者，儘量掠奪其勞力。奴隸貿易利益之大，常自百分之五十至百分之二百。苦力是奴隸的變相。十九世紀中葉，南洋被列强瓜分後，中國人由自由移民而多變爲契約移民。契約移民是由外國政府或商業機關在中國招募勞工，而年限待遇訂有一定契約，實含有奴隸販賣的性質，即我國所謂「阪豬仔，」外人所謂「苦力貿易。」中國人耐苦，服從工資低廉，殆爲最適宜的勞工，尤以亞熱帶和熱帶地方，白人對氣候不馴服，土人又懶惰，其適用於勞動者，未有若中國人者，各國遂競相招募契約華工。</p>
<p>時至今日，仍有苛刻的契約華工招募，例如最近英商大英憐質公司在粤桂兩省招募譯員三名，機械員二一六名，勞工九七〇名，赴海洋那留兩島工作。招募的章程有很多苛虐的地方，如招往的華工須經該公司香港代理李榮士頓公司選擇並經醫生的檢騐，然而又規定華工登陸前再須受當地政府的檢騐，凡不合標準者，遣其回返香港。這無異說明香港的撿査一筆勾銷。倘登陸前所遇不公，華工來往，損失不貲，公司就不管了。每日工作時間多至九小時以上，核與國際勞工大會決定八小時工作制顯然不合。因工致死的撫卹金，其家屬祗得領收該工人全年薪金，未免過少。英國本國內的撫卹費常爲該工人三十六個月至四十個月的收入，何以對我要歧視？這種都是問題，深望當局於會議時特別作專案提出。</p>
<p>更有言者，僑蘇西伯利亞一帶的華工，寒風砭骨，堅冰在鬚，辛苦終議，而所獲工資，不得滙寄祖國以贍養，父母妻子，歸國時，行李衣服均受嚴格限制，現款絕對不得携帶出境，如此特別待遇，試問會議時應作何打算？</p>
<p>會議的搜築資料，也是個緊要問題，勞工神聖非始自西洋，吾國古代視勞工十分尊重，不見考工記載。『國有六職，百工與居一焉』嗎？此次中國勞工資料必須普遍搜集，深入搜集。本年十一月是搜集的截止期，在此三個月內一定要加倍的出力出汗，要集多數人的汗血，集中精力，一絲不鬆的認眞幹。有關的政府機關自中央以至地方，都該有專門人員埋頭先做綜合分析的工作；有關的學術機關，學校，報館，社團，甚至個人調査所獲的原始材料，都要向他們殷勤的索取，主持搜集的人要像水銀似的無孔不入。因爲這次會議是破天荒的一次。因爲這次會議是要與印度暹羅諸國比較，沒有的材料是無法可想，有的材料而不去搜集，那眞是太自暴自棄。同時，國人也該自動的將他所知所有的一切，貢獻於該會，這不是出風頭，這是國家榮辱所繫。</p>
<p>將來提案除根據議程外，更要根據良心多有臨時的提案。大會的講詞，勞方資方的演說，都要費些心思硏究，最緊要的各人所說的數字必須絕對要相同。此時組織提案小組，急不容緩。出席的代表團，我國至少可有二十人，此種人選，須定標準，務必要物色各方面的專門家。因爲一切事成效在人，不是阿狗阿貓都可去開會，否則文不對題，只有加深我們的恥辱。人選下月內必須決定，以便各人早早準備，免得臨海而掘井。</p>
<p>散居亞洲的華僑工友數約七百萬，會議時必須要有他們自己的喉舌，那是天經地義。做當地的勞資代表是不是合理？是不是可若商與土人會不會起競爭的衝突？與統治的政府會不會生政策的矛盾？我們用什麼技巧達到三方滿意的結果？在在需要事先佈置，事先準備。</p>
<p>凡事豫則立，不豫則廢。我們趕快要準備，準備着開一次像探的會議。（三五，八，十四於首都。）</p>

<h3>自私的好人</h3>
<p>— 趙丹</p>
<p>一個演員在演一個我之前，總會有人問他：「你演的是正派呢，還是反派啊？」這很使一個有經騐的演員難以回答，因爲一個角色的性格實在無法用正派和反派這兩個字來包括的。譬如：「日出」里的胡四，是一個二十七歲的小伙子；你若說他是正派小生，他却是一個游手好閒的人；你若說他是反派人物，他却沒有什麼陰謀做什麼壞事。尤其一個演員，更不能給這個無血肉和無含義的名詞圈住。否則，他將把所有的性格演成一個完全同樣的典型人物。一個演員創造一儸人物，必須從他內在的情感和思想做出發點；等他把這人物創造完成，表現在銀幕或舞台上的時候，再議人家去肯定或否定他的存在價値。因此，我們稱呼一個活生生的，有血有肉的性格，不該用那含糊而籠統的名詞，更不該就那樣地確定了一個性格的身份，應該從他們的思想和情感做出發點。</p>
<p>這次在「遙遠的愛」里，我演的是一個敎授。這角色就根本無法用一個固定的名詞來包括。導演曾開玩笑地說：「一個不是壞蛋的壞蛋」，像這樣的人物，反派和正派，肯定與否定都包含不了這人物的性格和行動。那麼，這該怎麼說呢？照我的意思應該說：一個思想停留在四十年代的，很自私的好人。</p>
<h3>如何學習昆曲</h3>
<p>— 玄廬</p>
<p>邇來學曲之風，頗爲盛行。國家高等學府，遵照部章，於文學院中國文學系必修學程中，大都設有「曲選」學分，以資傳授。社會間也不少追縱風雅之士，以能哼幾句崑曲爲樂，甚至大家少艾，名門閨秀，亦多趨之若驚。所謂某某曲社某某雅集，一時成爲風尙。此中國亦不乏徒資消遺，兼投時好者，但爲優美之樂藝所感召，喪斯調之將成絕響，因而犧牲一部分精神，探求國樂之眞髓，以繼絕存亡起衰補敝爲已任者，常亦大有其人。</p>
<p>不過此道凋零，已不自今始，而帥資之缺乏，則於今爲尤烈。大抵在高等學府執教鞭者，文采有餘，而昔律鮮嫻。其授曲也，無非在雍熙樂府，陽春白雪，朝野新聲，詞令摘艷諸書中，選小令或散套數首，或在元曲選，盛明雜劇，或六十種曲諸書，選南北曲數支，令學者諷詠吟哦之。其講習曲學也，亦無非摭拾近人王國維吳梅諸氏之唾餘而無所發明。至於如何協宮商如何被管絃，則敎者非所嫻，學者亦未曾有所聞。換言之，曲之音樂的成分，已爲所遺棄，而僅僅致意於具文學的成份。結果所届，敎曲與敎詩詞無以異，學曲亦與學詩詞無以異。以如是方式傳授斯一絕學，則曲藝之能被保存者幾希</p>
<p>其次社會間之傳授曲藝者，則有所謂笛師，俗稱「拍先」者，（拍先者拍曲先生之簡稱）大抵爲老伶工所改業，或在梨園中充伴奏者，（即所謂塲面）其藝雖皆有所師承，而大都不學有術，所謂藝而未進於道者也。</p>
<p>敎曲者不出以上兩種人物，於是而我國之曲藝，不得不失傳矣。何以言之？蓋在大學教授縫帳之下習曲者，僅知讀曲如讀詩詞，作曲如作詩詞。至於曲在音樂上及在戲劇上之成就與優點，則「恕未學習。」在笛師檀板之下習曲者，僅知張喉而歇，而不知曲學爲何物，曲律爲何事，猶之鸚鵡學語，似則似矣。究之意義何在，則瞠目不知所對。二者非並行而不悖，實背道而脫節，此無怪曲藝之日漸漸滅，以致淪亡也。</p>
<p>作者曾爲大學敎授，在大學文學院擔任「曲選」學程，亦曾爲義務笛帥，週旋於所謂曲社雅集之間，二者之甘苦，躬親體認，故尙能約略言之。</p>
<p>竊以爲學曲之步驟有三，一曰度曲，二曰譜曲，三曰作曲。此三者固須逐步漸進，未可躍級躁進，但因其互相關連之密不可分，故於進至某一階段之際，斷乎不可遺棄其他二者。換言之，學度曲者雖尙未至譜曲之階段，但譜曲作曲之理論與格律，不能不懂。否則其學習之進程爲事倍功半，共所僅能達到之造詣，爲機械的而缺乏藝術的靈性者也。同時學作曲者，亦必須嫻習譜曲度曲之技能，學譜曲者，又必須富具作曲度曲之天才。否則不是紙上談兵，不切實際，亦將觸處扞格，無從下筆。蓋三者之關係，爲連環性的，絕對不能割裂者也。今之學曲者，無論出自大學文學院，或出自曲社雅集，莫非將此連擊之環，切而爲三，曲道之消沉，此爲大原因。</p>
<p>依作者主張，學曲雖不必三者（作曲譜曲度曲）同時並進，但敎者却不可不融三者於一爐，俾學者有舉一反三之樂，無膠柱鼓瑟之苦。因此其敎學之方式，自當異於嚮所採機械呆板之師徒傳授方式。</p>
<p>竊以爲敎學任何一種學術，必須有其計劃，此一計劃，必須先將此一學術之全貌，加以整個之觀察，然後予以有組織的解剖，俾得劃分若干互相　接之等分，再按各等分之深淺難易，分別先後，擬訂進度。如此劃分之等分，分之爲各階段，合之則爲整體，是爲有計劃的教學方式。學習任何學術，胥不能逃此公式。至崑曲則以其本身尙未成爲一種有組織的學術，學者又多狃於傳統的師徒傳援方式，而不知改革，故迄尙未產生任何種有計劃的教學方式。作者不揣愚昧，擬在此方面作一嘗試。</p>

<h3>看「春寒」的演出</h3>
<p>— 寇嘉弼</p>
<p>前年的冬天，「春寒」在重慶上演的時候，不但上座擁擠不堪，並且還獲得了新聞文化界的一致好評。尤其是演員們的表演藝術，在我的腦海裏留下了一個不能磨滅的印象。</p>
<p>在這炎熱的暑天，「春寒」在「蘭心」拉開了幕參加這演出，大部份還是原有的演員，陶金節老醫生周璞，他不但抓住了一個典型的外形，就連角色內在的性格，也給挖掘到心靈的深處，我看見一個生活樸實，性情耿直，態度認眞，心地善良的周璞在台上活動，却沒有看出陶金「要向着那要害的地方打」的精神。</p>
<p>女醫生方潔如，經過有　術修養的舒　文的創造，成爲一個有血肉的生命。她將角色真執的熱情，空虛的夢想，純良的心地，意志的不堅强，給她表露得無遺。獲得了觀衆們無限的同情。雖然演員盡到了最大的職責，但是因爲角色本身受到劇本的限制，所以在演出的過程裏，不能顯示出她高度的表演藝術。</p>
<p>我在許多戲裏，看見凡是壞人，演員都把他演成一個所謂反派的人物，這是演員爲了想獲得觀衆們强烈的效果，因此在對話和動作上，盡量作出使人厭惡的樣子，「春寒」中的賀知遠是個大　子，他在吃人的人　裏打　，在血　　撈　　吃的人物。　　的心　和卑鄙的手段。僞裝在闊綽嚴正的外形，和高貴的氣質裏，確實是現社會裏的獨特的典型，宗由演時很好，惟講話的遠度與衆不合。</p>
<p>劉犁飾小　子何　，對話和動作均不够放淚，缺少油滑氣，白沉飾科長任伯禽，已經作到了陰險奸惡的性格，但對話聲音過底，有許多台詞聽不淸楚，　江　縣長絕少陽，只是作到了樸實的外形和潔　的心地，缺乏堅强的氣質和縣長的身份，因此顯示並不幹練，夏天飾同善社長任士　，却給他創造成一個完整的性格，唯化裝過於年老，他表演的動作，語氣，神態均顯示比較年靑。因此覺得：老而「太」壯。</p>
<p>童曼讀飾小護士鄭需芬，方伯飾校長吳子淸，王薇飾校長夫人蔡氏，强明飾記者吳騏，雖然在劃中處於次要地位，但他們都盡到了應盡的職責，都恰到好處。總之此次演出的藝術水準比戴慶的演出更有深度。</p>
<p>在短短的一個月里。看了四個戲的演出，也看到了許多負盛名而有成就的演員，他們的表演，確實可以使觀衆拍案叫絕，但在整個演出上，缺乏集體連擊，不能成爲一個完整的演出，「春寒」里的演員，雖然有强弱，但他們對於戲劇藝術是認眞的，態度是嚴肅的，始終精神不懈，在這戲劇厄運時期，我們更需要嚴正的演出，和完　的藝術作品。</p>
<h3>評「忠義之家」</h3>
<p>— 朱德豐</p>
<p>秦怡在遙遠的愛中</p>
<p>「忠義之家」是勝利後的第一部國產片，終於在八月五日，假大光明先與文化界見面。這千呼萬喚始出來的首次難產片，當然是要特別的重視，需另眼相看。綜聞數日來的一般評論，紛紛不一，各有其理，甚至還開起　戰來的！</p>
<p>這裏依我個人的偏見，來說幾句想說的話。第一點我先要說：這是一般人所値得一看的電影，甚至還可以說必需看一看的片子。故事雖很平凡，是描寫上海淪陷時期敵僞的殘酷和漢奸的醜態。以一家刻苦耐勞和忠義堅貞的人家來發展它的故事。這裏有：封鎖斷糧，米販遭搶擊和敵軍縱犬咬人，買戶口米被鞕打，強派新申報，公報私仇捉到憲兵隊灌水上電刑，搜索恐怖份子等種種殘酷的劣跡，一覽無遺。我相信長住在上海的人，這一幕幕的鏡頭，都是前一時期耳聞目睹的事實；也許還有很多人曾經歷過；雖然時久會忘，但也難免會印象淡薄。看了這部片子，等於重溫一遍往事，會使你不寒而慄，汗毛豎起；會激起你一種憤怒的情感和復仇的心理。</p>
<p>在另一方面的華家呢？正好是表現出威武不能屈，富貴不能誘的正義精神。劉瓊一人飾兩角，年靑的維剛雖可發揮的地方很少，但飾老年的父親却發揮的地方很多。</p>
<p>全劇的氣氛很悲哀，使觀衆的情感沈陷在悲痛的劇情里，我偸偸地看到許多的女觀衆都用手帕在揩眼淚，這就可證明這片在觀衆的心裏是收到應得的効果了。</p>
<h3>一週電影短評</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>木週特別好的片子還是很少，以「義犬尋主」餃佳，似是導演在人的一部份還缺少力量。</p>
<p>義犬尋主</p>
<p>劇本簡單，但插入鄕邨老夫婦與賣藝的兩塲很不壞，導演對於狗的處理極好，蘭茜的眼神很深刻，感人心弦，大黑狗的兇猛，小白狗的可愛，都有很好的成績。惟對人，除鄕下老夫婦外，均欠佳，小主人和蘭茜大團圓一塲，在小主人一方未見而時，可把氣氛壓低，因爲低後易於產生好高潮。</p>
<p>游鳳嬉龍</p>
<p>故事完全美國輕鬆化，導演常常造成好笑料，有獨到之筆，幾個人物如偵探，店家，老　等等穿插得不壞。</p>
<p>李卻福倫，戲懷得最好，把劇中人的個性很自然的描摹出來。</p>
<p>結束不壞，不落俗套。</p>
<p>火綫英雌</p>
<p>戲是沉着的，直　後來方始積極　開，處理尙不壞，不過嫌長，也是導演沒有成功的地方。</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白很稱職，桑尼德甫次，在此處初上銀幕，成績不壞。</p>
<p>飛機轟炸，不及「血濺巴丹島」的開幕，所以說導演沒有特出。</p>

<p>四十八明星介紹的幾你新明星，可惜得很，一個也沒有好的成績，然而我們在這兒可以見到鮑才琪的幾個人談話的塲面相當靈活和　紥，但是六塲幾十人的音樂隊和跳舞的噓頭都是糟的，因爲他沒有給他們寬火的地盤，這是鮑才琪最失策的地方。</p>
<p>名媛弄情記</p>
<p>輕鬆喜劇來得相當少的時候，這部片子是蜀中的廖化，但是常這類片子源源而來的時候，它便要相形遜色了，只要與「職業夫人」與「游鳳嬉龍」一比便知。</p>
<p>全片除對白上尙有小噱頭以外，在技巧上毫無精彩，即如幾次三番的　車內景，也顯得非常枯燥。</p>
<p>橫渡太平洋</p>
<p>編劇散漫，是該劇最大毛病，亨弗萊鮑嘉沒有顯出個性，曼麗愛絲德演來最糟，比較起來，倒還是我國兩個演員成功，但是也沒有多少高明。</p>
<p>導演在有幾個塲面是好的，那是在前半部，在後半部他也和編劇一樣，列入睡眼狀態了。</p>
<p>雙槍獨行俠</p>
<p>這是最差的一部片子，導演在全片中沒有精神，第一段戲好像可以删去，末塲壯士與惡棍搏鬥的塲面太草率從事，即是他成績最好的桑尼德甫次被判弔死的一塲，也沒有造成很好的氣氛。</p>
<p>白蓓蘭勃麗頓演來最好，是有希望的一員。</p>
<p>這一次演員員中最好的幾個，特列下：</p>
<p>（一）蘭西（狗），在「義犬尋主」中。</p>
<p>（二）李却　倫，在「游鳳嬉龍」中。</p>
<p>（三）白蓓蘭勃麗威頓，在「雙槍獨行俠」中。</p>
<p>本週好演員太少，簡直拉不出來了，勉强的說，「火綫英雌」中的克勞黛考爾白，與「義犬救主」的羅蒂愛克這爾，可列入次等。</p>

<h3>杜芃諾</h3>
<p>— 錫壽</p>
<p>亨利·杜芃諾（Henri　Duvernois　1875-1936）生於巴黎，是一個多才多智的作家，產量之多好比汲不盡的泉水，生平著作共有七十多卷。杜氏極早離開了家庭，過着流浪的生活。最初在夏邦蒂哀書店充當記，結識了許多名人。二十歲左右，奮勉地寫些東西投給日報（Le　Journal），巴黎生活（Vie　Parisienne），番密娜（Femina）等刊物發表。他以幽默，輕松而饒有趣味的筆調來寫着，凡是可以使寫者喜悅的，他都要寫一點。一九〇三年出了第一部長篇小說鐵的蘆葦（Le　Roseau　ce　ler），翌年出版了夫婦的床（Nane　ou　le　lit　conjugal），就稍露頭角。他並不自滿，繼續努力，寫成了克拉下脫（Crapotte　1908），立刻驚動了法國文壇。</p>
<p>杜氏所說的大都是他親眼見過的，因為在他漂泊的少年時代，已經認識了一羣流浪者，瘋少女，可笑的發明家，輕躁的人，無賴漢和騙子等等，他把他們一一收集到小說裏去。非非拏耶茶（Fifinoiseau　1913短篇集），會說話的狗（Le　chien　qui　parle　1913短篇集）等，都是他的小傑作。杜氏第一期的著作，含有一點表面的樂觀主義，大都脫不了大街上的景象，簡直可說是大街文學。</p>
<p>自從杜氏成熟後，對於生活有了更深的認識。他底第二期的大著可以小說死獸（Morte　la　bete　1925）為模範。杜氏將滑稽和悲慘，思想和情感混和在一起，且已遠離了大街，拋棄了表面的樂觀主義。</p>
<p>杜芃諾第三期的著作是偏向戲劇方面了。他底富有吸引力的對話是大眾所贊揚的。在這時期，開初他寫些短劇，小喜劇，如鴛鴦俱樂部（Le　club　ces　canards　Mandarins）之類，竟以是一鳴驚人。杜氏劇中的人物與主題大半汲自他從前的小說。</p>
<p>杜芃諾是一位深刻的觀察家，他將所得的印象擴大開來，用了新奇的筆尖，給人一種新的觀念。他底豐富的想像力委實令人驚佩不止。各種個性的人物，他都以吸引人的方式寫遍了。杜氏是當代法國的第一流作家，他曾創造了許多人物，如巴爾札克底一樣的活躍，一樣的動人。他是用着像講機密事般的神氣，帶着稍低而輕快的聲調道出那些事件；以寫實的態度處理那些我們所熟悉的人物。高超的技術配合着豐富的情緒，幽默，令人莫測的結局；給予我們每一篇作品都以為是他所寫中最好的一篇傑作之感。現在，多數作家是從現實逃往幻想，而杜氏却相反，從幻想逃到現實。杜氏是只認識巴黎的社會，專寫巴黎的風俗作家。</p>
<h3>大頭伯伯哭了！</h3>
<p>— 哈瑞</p>
<p>范大頭剛到溪村的時候，人都說他是怪物，因為他的頭，大得可怕，亮光光的，看不到一根頭髪，並且一臉的瘡疤，好似一張立體的地圖，左眼皮給一個傷痕翻了起來，所以他的眼睛好似永遠在憤怒！</p>
<p>日子久了，人都發覺他是個好人，他勤儉作工，他歡喜孩子，並且常講故事給他們聽，直聽得每個孩子出了神，口水拖在嘴角，有一寸來長。</p>
<p>一天，太陽掛得老高，沒有一片片的浮雲。沿着一條溪邊，范大頭獨個躊躇着，低着頭，臉色不很好看，忽然一羣孩子湧了過來：</p>
<p>「大頭伯伯，講故事！」</p>
<p>「別吵！我今天沒有心向」！說着將右手縮進袖管，抓住了袖口，沒頭沒腦地在光頭上揩了一通。</p>
<p>「嗯，說呀！我們一起要聽」。孩子牽掛着他的布認，你拉一下，他推一下；范大頭望着這一羣無邪的生命，腦海上浮起了兩個影子……。</p>
<p>他終於在溪邊的一塊大石上坐下，「咳」！一口黃膿痰吐入了溪水，接着用袖口擦了一下嘴唇。</p>
<p>「好，讓我再說一個故事吧！從前有一個木匠，他有一個老婆和一個兒子，因為勤儉的緣故，一家子還過得去，他的老婆才叫賢惠呢！一天到晚忙着料理家務，等木匠回去，還要服侍男人揩身洗脚，她從不大聲大氣地，體貼丈夫，也歡喜孩子，她…。</p>
<p>——他一直低着頭，望着被陽光照耀成千萬片金銀的水，眼眶內，滾滾的，滿是淚。</p>
<p>「那孩子也眞逗人喜歡，圓的臉，大眼睛，烏而黑，望起人來，像這水光一樣的眩眼！</p>
<p>——他灣下腰，下意識地手搯着靜流的溪水，數滴眼淚，投向過流，沒有一個孩子覺察到。</p>
<p>「那時和你們一樣，我天天講故事人聽，他很乖，從不瞎吵，並且還會跟大人呀呀的吊嗓……不過憑空打起什麽仗來了，飛機轟轟的丟下一顆大彈子，媽的，正落在木匠家的門口，啊！那才怕人哪！轟……」</p>
<p>「呀！那麽木匠和他的老婆兒子呢？」</p>
<p>「別打岔！唉，我永世不會忘掉的，孩子哭着喊媽媽，女人死抱着孩子，就是拍拍的一陣響，中　直朝着他們頭上飛下來，只有啊的一聲，什麽都完了……烟迷霧成一片，我，不，那個木匠待要奔過去，但已來不及了，讓火燄噴上了臉，灼得針刺樣的痛……」</p>
<p>他說到這兒停止了；手，抖索地捫摸着滿是瘡搬的臉！</p>
<p>「木匠從此沒有看見他的老婆兒子了嗎？」</p>
<p>孩子們艾艾地問。</p>
<p>「嗯！」有些抽噎。</p>
<p>「那麽木匠呢？說呀！大頭伯伯，後來呢」</p>
<p>「木匠，木匠……唉！還有什麽可說的呢？孩子們，祗希望你們一生一世不要再看見打仗了！」</p>
<p>「咦！大頭伯伯，你臉上怎潮了，你哭了？」</p>
<p>「大頭伯伯哭了！」</p>
<p>是的，大頭伯伯哭了，大聲地，有着無限的憤怒，怨尤，悲哀。</p>
<h3>從軍（世界名譽選載）</h3>
<p>— 歌爾作·藏倫敦季爾德美術官</p>
<p>歌爾（W．H．Gore）自幼受美術敎育之熏陶，一八八〇年入皇家學院。「從軍」一幅於一八八五年在皇家學院首次展覽，其背景係凱南特村之牧塲，為作者自幼生長之地。畫中之男子已應召入伍，正與其麥分離，凄測之情，洋溢畫面，令人感動欲淚。</p>
<h3>·簷·下·</h3>
<p>— 張白懐</p>
<p>那個執拗的女孩子哭了。她底面色孤苦地表現　營養不足的蒼黃，不幸的母親站在旁邊，眼裏有一層悲哀的暗影。</p>
<p>「去吧，」女人無可奈地說着：「沒有人笑的，赤脚有什麽要緊呢！……」</p>
<p>孱弱的女遽爾哭得更加辛酸！她的淚眼凝視着簷下的雨滴，拿着一雙紅邊的小白布鞋，另一隻枯瘦的小手揩拭着眼淚。</p>
<p>這是一件充滿悲哀的事情呵。一個已經上了十歲的孩子，難道還不明白沒有父親是人生無可彌償的缺憾嗎？</p>
<p>我知道這孩子底父親是怎樣死去了的。這不幸的女人，當更永遠不會記記……。</p>
<p>那個男人就這樣無聲無息地去了。當他還活着的時候，也許多少還能給她們一點快樂。我記得他是那樣一個矮小的人，他的圓大的眼睛是呆滯而且空虛的；猪肝色的嘴唇厚厚地翹起，好像對什麽人都不肯寬恕。</p>
<p>在廚房里，他做着最下等的雜務，洗碗，挑水，和抹桌子。他沒有笑容，也極少說話，即使偶而因為反抗別人的一句詛罵，也祗是嗷嗷地模糊到不能聽見。</p>
<p>他常常是赤膊的，他沒有衣服穿，那一身焦黑的皮膚，瘦面孔，剃了個光壳的頭顱，看見就够使人替他難受。現在這個女人，他留下的眼妻子，亦和他一樣；她的頭髪蓬鬆而且骯髒，破鞋子裏面的那雙脚，一看就使人想到，她恐怕有半個月沒有用水來洗一洗了。他們祗掙到兩頓飯吃。</p>
<p>到今天，好像已經走過很長很長的路，然而，那才不過是去年的秋天。</p>
<p>可怕的疫癘像索命的遊魂似的在村鎭一舞蹈，同時傅說敵人立刻就要帶着焚燒和殺戮到來。那是一個慌亂而又哀愁的季節。</p>
<p>那個男人，唉，我是眞不願再一次被這苦痛的印象踐踏了。他的脚上暴露着洞穴似的紅腫的毒瘡，還勉强一担一担的挑着水，後來，女人暫時代替着他的勞役，不，也就從此永遠代替了他的勞役了。</p>
<p>山坡上有了一堆新的黃土，聽說是用兩塊木板埋葬掉的。</p>
<p>女人的眼睛腫得可怕。同情的心也腫得可怕，而更使女人流盡她最後一滴眼淚的，却是那個出生不過七八個月的嬰兒，也緊隨着不幸的爸爸，在疫癘的恐怖中，完成一次生命的經歷……。</p>
<p>此刻我呆立在簷前聽這孩子啜泣着。早晨的天空飄着雨絲，一連串的印象絞割着我的記憶。我早知道她已把女兒送到附近的國民學校，然而我不知道，這孩子竟那樣不明白她底母親的心。</p>
<p>「她又哭什麽呀？」</p>
<p>「落雨，說人家有套鞋牠沒有套鞋，不肯不學……」</p>
<p>這時，一個梳兩條標　的小辮子的女孩子走過我的身邊。她穿着黑色的衣裙，背一個紫紅色書包，脚上新的膠鞋黑而發亮，她一面望着一面撑起了雨傘，得意地走進濛濛的雨中。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>不到幾個月，她的父母，一前一後，相繼死了。（那時候愁悶而死的人，可多着哩）。她，一個十五六歲的女孩子，總算有心胸，有打算。她先設法把店關了。關店，談何容易，在那種局面下，關店比開店，至少要困難到一萬倍。可居然被她關成功了。雖然沒弄到手相當的代價，總算弄回了些錢。她的計劃，就是進關，到北平，或是上濟南。北平有幾個同學，濟南有幾個老親戚。</p>
<p>「那時候，我也說不出什麽理由，祗跟牠談了幾句話，就十分關切起來。」鶴見又注意到我而前的那封信，怔怔的瞧着。「害怕她又要碰見浪人哪什麽的，就一路伴送她回家。」</p>
<p>「她可以說長得挺美，不像日本女子那樣裝模作樣，更不是中國女子那種嬌媚。照我的眼光看，她可以說得上健康美三個字。天眞衷又滲合些黠靈，活潑，却不那麽輕佻—相當的莊重。我說莊重，您要知道她那時才十五六歲哪。</p>
<p>「我那時候旣是打定主意，做一番事業，所以要抓住時襪，培植些純潔的，健康的，新血輸子，所以在談話這中，給了她一點暗示。」</p>
<p>鶴兄第二天就給她把通行證弄到了手，因為那時候，參謀總部高於一切，鶴見在部裏又相當的紅，所以輕而易舉的把事辦妥了。同時鶴見代她擬了一個學程計劃，又派了一個手下，暗地護送她到了北平。</p>
<p>從此，耀羣，這東北的女兒，一直是在鶴見的保護之中。他指點她進了一個很完美的敎會大學，她的一舉一動，都有人做報告。無論精神上，特質上，耀羣祗要稍稍有了不安的感覺，鶴見立時就給她改善或彌補起來。到了大學三年，鶴見覺得她的普通學識已經够了，同時，也有別種的機緣，所以寫了一封和信，勸她立刻出關，學習一點特殊的技能，一是事業上不可少的技能——射擊，柔術，急救，偵察，測繪，攝影，密碼索隱，電訊收發，軍事常識，騎術，駕駛術等。敎師是一位特殊人物，一位歸化了中國的西人。</p>
<p>「她現在已經是成人了。體格長得恰合標準。」鶴見愈說愈興奮，「我常常趁她練習的當口，躱在一邊偷瞧，見她眞用功，眞肯幹」。</p>
<p>「大哥，她可眞痛苦哩——精神上的悶壓——因為始終她祗知道我是姓古，一個中國軍人，（偽軍人，可是，是一個有志氣，有辦法，而負有一種特殊使命的人。）她在北平和我通信，我讓她寄到瀋陽郵務局代轉。到了關外，我把這方法取消了，告訴她，我已經遠行，到旁的地方去了。</p>
<p>「她可不是傻瓜。三番兩轉弄點小花樣，想從她的敎師口裏，探聽我的行踪。那，您想辦得到嗎？上郵局去追問，更問不出所以然來。她唯一的寄托就是意想中的「特殊使命」四個字。這也是我解除她精神上不安定的唯一法寶。</p>
<p>「我為什麽不見她呢？」鶴見極力抑制着自己的感情，可也藏不住一種痛苦的表現。「大哥，您替我說說，我能見她嗎……？」</p>
<p>鶴見說到這裏，悵悵然地釘着我瞧了一會，漸漸低下頭，漸漸交叉起那有力而靈活的雙手，撑住額角，掩住了臉面。這也許就呌「兒女情長，英雄氣短」吧。</p>
<p>我也柑橘到一種莫名的惘悵，本能地又拿起那厚厚一疉的長信來：</p>
<p>「古君，我始終記得您有一封信上說過，「等到國內有事的日子，也許就是我們見面的時候」。您看，關內的事，不是已經發動了嗎？您為什麽還不讓我見面呢？難道您不需要人帮忙嗎？</p>
<p>「儘可能思索到的唯一理由，也許您認為，我們雖說祗有一二次短促的會晤，却有五六年的交誼，感情上，也許不祗泛泛之交了；恐怕一旦見面，就要墮入尋常兒女愛情的陷坑裏去了，因此就要耽誤了事業。</p>

<h3>沒看錯</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>一位親戚向我訴苦，他最近為了房子與孩子，（總稱學子）弄得焦頭爛額了。他原借住在朋友家，可是大房東把房子賣了，他不得不搬出來，向那兒搬呢？報上多的是召頂什麼房子七條半，出頂什麽房子十二條，他，沒看錯。他也很知道一條條子是多少，偏偏條子却不來聽他指揮。</p>
<p>他有五個在學的孩子，想想省市立學校已考過，私立學校又讀不起，孩子怎辦？幸好趕上市立各中學的第二次招生，就按着報上的招生廣吿，找一個與朋友家較近的學校，替孩子去報名，跑到該校一看，門口貼了一張字條「早」已搬了校址，又跑去新校址（新舊校址相距三四里呢），從校門直走進辦公處並未看見佈吿等類的紙張指示報名，辦公處坐着兩個職員，懒懶地說：「今天來報名？本校「早」定是九月一日。」他再一翻帶去的當天報紙，該校明註着舊地址，而且確係当天報名，他沒看錯。</p>
<p>關於房子，我們希望頂費小費的實際剷除，別讓上海的房子永遠與條子結不解　；關於學校玩這種莫名其妙的搶花來浪費學生家長的時間精力，我們也實在想不出什麼把學生家長看成自作孽的適當的理由。</p>
<p>嚕嚕囌囌，不知市政當局也同我們一樣厭惡這類事否？</p>
<h3>教育，教育，教育！</h3>
<p>— 陳瑜</p>
<p>爲了求過於供，復員帶來了不少的學子，最近又在鬧學校荒了，一般公立的學校，每因學額有限，對學生數，但求其少，不願其多，敎員樂得少改幾份卷子，學校當局，也可减少些麻煩，至於學校門外的學生，無論怎樣擠，她總是漠不關心，像電車售票先生一樣，不來理你。私立學校呢，雖想多收容些學生，來寬裕些經費，但歷年的淸苦敎育，加以嚴重的房荒，即使尙能苟延維持，不致倒閉改行，那裏還聽到有創辦添設，更雜得有餘力來擴充與改義了！</p>
<p>淸苦了多年的敎師們，似乎也可吐一口酸氣，但是這不是一個吐氣的時候，更不是一個居奇的機會，那是一個多麽嚴重的敎育問題，我們難道就能冷眼看它的演變麽？</p>
<p>急救的辦法，當然不能盼望舉校復員來解決，這裏不外是擴充名額與添增學級，這點還是公立學校，來負責辦理，較爲順利，校舍不妨申請當局多撥些敵產，即日停止標賣敵僞房產，從速設法改裝利用。</p>
<p>建國時期，敎育第一，的確，敎育在建國中的重要性，定可想見，可是，試看勝利一年以來，進口物品源源而來而其中有關敎育用品的圖書，儀器，能有多少，敵產接收了不少，撥充高等敎育上用的又有多少？反之，軍人佔住校舍，倒常有所聞，像新本等校的問題，不是鬧得很久嗎？還有國立復且大學，聽說爲了宿舍免被佔住起見，決定辦暑期學校來對付。你想有趣麽？</p>
<p>想起前天的飛機模型比賽，有人說，足以引起一般人對航空的興趣，但是，我相們，現代的國人，封航空事業，可說，都已相當重視了，尤其是求學的靑年們，他們幾乎都能知道，時代對他們的重視，所以他們大部份（可說全部〕都肯努力，用功，硏究與苦斡，並且都願獻身於未來的建國偉大工程中，但是爲了學額的限制，使他們整批的擯之門外了！年青的一羣，是遭折回了—頽喪了！</p>
<p>敎育第一，不單是口號，應當以事實來表現，要切實地，有計劃地來推行！</p>
<p>中國吃今日的苦頭，主因在敎育，而時至此刻，還不努力敎育，我問你：怎麽辦啊！</p>
<h3>郵資加價</h3>
<p>— 許泓</p>
<p>一度傳說即須　價的郵資，暫時因行政院不予考慮而不能實行了。據說，要兩個月之後再談，郵局虧損由國庫撥轉。</p>
<p>初看起來，似乎是當局底善良措置，郵資不加，减少人民負担與避免刺激物價上漲。但是，細細想來，不加價倒有很多不妥的地方在。</p>
<p>我們總覺得，從事於國營事榮，不應有賺錢的心理，但，亦不必存心虧蝕。在這物價上漲的時候，合理的調整是應該的。每次調整時，如果漲高率不大，則不易刺激物價，化整爲零地調整，更可减少對物復上漲的刺激力。</p>
<p>以今日的物價來說，一副大餅油條要一百元，打一個公用電話至少二百元，多至五百元，而寄一封平信祗要二十元，這是什麽比例？二十元的價錢，還是七個月之前訂的價錢，幾個月來物價漲了多少？公務員待遇調整了幾次？爲什麽不讓郵局唯一收入來源的郵資漲價？假使說，郵局的收支仍能平衡，我們常然不贊成讓它加價，可是，上月的虧損竟達一百萬萬元！八月份公務員待遇調整後普遍增加百分之五十以上，那末我們估計本月份的虧損將達一百五十萬萬元以上，那末假使眞的兩個月以後再調整，那末在這三月中，郵局虧損將達四百萬萬元。由國庫撥抵，很好。但是，國庫充裕嗎？國庫裏的錢從那裏來的？誰都知道，國庫根本不充裕，錢是從人民身上用各種各樣的名目征收來的！多少事業爲了國家沒有錢！就是國庫不富裕！不能興辦，而國家又把道本不富裕的國庫裏的鉅大款項用於並不必要的事業上，我們實在不懂！</p>
<p>談到刺激物價，在上次郵資從一元一封平信加到廿元一封的加法，才足以刺激物價！從一月中旬所訂的廿元一封平信加到足以使十月份郵局收支相抵的數字，依我們估計至少五倍至十倍，一口氣加五倍十倍廿倍的加價法才足以刺激物價上漲！如果在兩三個月前加了一倍半，在最近再加一倍，如此的加法，我們敢相信是合理的，需要的，不會刺激物價上漲的，至少沒有一次加上五倍十倍二十倍似地厲害！</p>
<p>因此，我們願意這次不增加郵資，我們卻反對郵資一加就是五倍十倍二十倍！我們更反對郵局底虧蝕款項由國庫撥抵的辦法！我們主張合理的加價。我們希望在最近就加一次，使郵局收支能相抵，以後公務員待遇調整一次—當然物價又變動過一次—郵資即調整一次，增加率以使郵局收支相抵，儘可能避免刺激物價上漲爲原則。我們敢相信，合理的調整是應該的，取之於民，合理地全部用之於民是大家贊同擁護的！</p>
<h3>不忍一笑</h3>

<p>外國兵：哈囉，賣票員！買張到底票子。</p>
<p>賣票員：很抱歉，武人買票，敝國尙無此例，可以免了。</p>
<h3>忙</h3>
<p>— 九章</p>
<p>相傳哲學家康德的生活是最有規律的。他每天早上在一定的時間從家裏走到大學裏去，數十年如一日。這條路上開了一爿小店，店裏的鐘快慢不一，倒要看康德先生出現的時候去調節。不過據某些筆記上說，這位寗靜，縝密的康德有一晚也失眠了。第二天，他遲了一點多鐘才向柏林大學踱去。這可使那小店的老闆疑慮起來，要打聽康德先生失眠的原因。晚上才知道前兩天巴黎起了革命。十八世紀是沒有電報和無綫電的，康德先生比那位小老闆消息早知道一天。當然，康德要把宇宙人生的事想個透澈，於是失眠了半夜，而那個小老闆一定無動於中，繼續他的門市業務。</p>
<p>自然，一提到十八世紀，和二十世紀一比，就是笨而且優的我也會感覺是一個强烈的對照。現代的生活忙，古代的生活閑，這只是一個籠就的槪念。工作爲什麼忙呢，因爲有機器，因爲人都有了競爭心。娛樂也跟着忙起來，幾時幾分趕什麽車去近郊遊憩，幾時幾分又趕車回市區赴宴。娛樂一成了忙事，生活的氣氛就變了，就現代化了罷。這和紅樓夢裏的無事忙卻大有分別。</p>
<p>晋朝的名士據說在雪夜訪友，走到友人的家門前，不進去了。他說，他只是爲看雪，「吾乘興而來，興盡即返，」何必一定要見着那個朋友呢？現代生活裏有狂人，無名士。</p>
<p>再抄一節小故事罷。英德大戰而美國沒有參加的時候，有一位美國記者留在柏林。巴黎失陷了。柏林的人有什麼表示？有什麼感想？一八七一年巴黎失陷過，柏林人鞦欣若狂：這一次可不同，每一個人繼續工作，繼續僞生活打算。比較窮的人還是注意配給品能不能多買一點，比注意西戰塲更甚。這位記者說，並不一定是納粹使人麻木到這個程度，「似乎每一個人都以爲那不過是按照參謀本部的計劃實行而已。」照他們的想法，參謀本部是下棋的人，前綫的衝鋒陷陣成了棋子的移動。得了一個名城就是下好了一着棋；而犧牲一部分人呢，也就好比犧牲幾個棋子罷。</p>
<p>其實我也不懷疑，現代生活需要組織，聯繫，緊張，忙碌；但是人在可以忘形歡樂一下的時候，還這麼嚴肅，也許有機械化之議。這當然不過是個極端的例子，不過現代生活該是更進一步的發揮人性，不是僵化了人性，這又是大問題了。</p>
<h3>書的死活</h3>
<p>— 瑩影</p>
<p>現代的學生，可以自慰一句：「讀書」兩個字，已　　死讀書而進步到活讀書了。從前學生是死讀書的，不容　諱，三家村的書熟唸的三字經，根本不知道「人之初，性本善，」是怎麽講？如果去問塾師準打痛你的小額角。他們只敎你照樣搬到科試卷上去，於是你中了秀才，舉人，甚至狀元，讀書的心願也完了。對於社會和國家，根本是另外一件事。</p>
<p>從前學生讀書固然可笑，而現代學生讀書則甚可憐，固然從死讀書回復到活讀需是事實。但是所謂活請書，還不是能一個字一個字的會講解而已。講解之後，有什麼用呢？敎師沒有想到，學生也沒有想到。讀書的心願還是希望入了中學，入了大學，以至出了洋，也就完結。進步的不過多了一番講解，雖然避免了死讀，而活讀也許太活了，變成虛讀，現代的敎育界沒有不如此這般，這應該不容掩諱的。最大的結癥，在於忘記了實用，讀了書要能够實實在在的應用，才不算虛讀。至於照樣捧着書本而心馳乎紅燈綠酒間的活讀，尤其要不得。</p>
<h3>連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（七八）</h3>
<p>— 張樂平作</p>
<h3>意外保險費</h3>
<p>— 杞人</p>
<p>誰說中國落伍？隨同着勝利，中國己經長足的進步了，請以事實爲證：</p>
<p>錫滬，滬太公路的長途汽車，售票時每客必需附繳「旅運意外保險費」一百元，保額二十萬元。於是乎旅客有保障矣。乘車失事，有偌大一筆保險金可領，這不是進步是什麽？</p>
<p>然而進步得也太悲慘了。本來，生活費用這樣高，一個人生存在這個進步的中國，要消耗掉多少物資，這生命的價値似乎很可以不必加以考慮了。譬如我們慈悲的保險公司，他就率直地把人命估價二十萬元——死一個人等於倉庫中霉爛了四石米；等於丟掉了一隻豬；或者等於一個學生一學期的學費吧。</p>
<p>至於這種征收保險錢的辦法，確然是再聽明不過的。在公路當局，旣可以避免掉多麼麻煩的「責任問題」，又做了一次兩全其美的掮客。在保險公司方面，每天不好算小的保險費，收收也很可觀了。</p>
<p>中國法律上從此多了一條規例：因過失致人死傷，應賠償損失二十萬元；但「未保險者，不在此例！」</p>
<h3>人人遵守交通法規　秩序第一安全第一</h3>
<p>— 人龍</p>
<p>上海交通問題的嚴重，由於先天不足與後天失調。先天不足是上海建築與街道，沒有計劃，凌亂不堪，這問題一時無法改善，現在實事求是，從後天失調說起。</p>
<p>後天不調的對象有二。一個是車輛，而另一個是行人。歸納謂起來，都是人的問題。此後是天下太平了，上海的車輛數目將有增無减。至於行人呢，在這個國際商業的都市裏將來也不會减少的。但是交通問題的嚴重却不僅在於車輛的樂多和行人的湧擠，而是在於上海人是否遵守交通法規（Traffic　Regulations）；換句話說，他們是否够資格做大都市的居</p>
<p>請看紐約</p>
<p>譬如說，在紐約吧，也是人多車多的地方。然而他們的交通情形又怎樣呢？在那裏，汽車是多極了，一輛隨着一輛，向前緩駛，有時比跑路還要緩慢，號角簡直是置而不用的。到了十字路口，便嚴格地依照交通指揮燈號來駕駛。速度有一定的限制，超過了那限制便有交通警察來抄號碼，隔日傳訊那車主到警局去受罰。他們是有條不紊的維持都市裏的交通秩序。老實說，解決這問題的辦法祗有兩個字：「守法」。至於交通警察的組織嚴密和忠於職守，那是純粹技術的問題。然而這也是我們治安當局可以效法的</p>
<p>血的紀錄</p>
<p>不過，和交通問題發生聯帶關係的還有一件嚴重的事情，値得我們加以考慮的：這就是車輛意外的案件。我們可以注意到勝利後本市的車輛意外案件是與時並進，無日無之，這些案件對於市民的安全發生限的威脅，每日爲輸下鬼者，或者因而殘廢渚，可謂數不勝數。這是我們治安當局和各界人士應予嚴密注意的問題。平時駕駛車輛不愼以致傷人，或致人死亡者的案件大都分爲兩種：一種是有過失的，而另一種無過失的。無過失的賠償了事，而有過失的逮交法院審理判罪及賠償以求解決。無過失的常然不成問題。但是有過失的照那棵處治恐怕還不足以促其悔禍之心。所以，我以爲那個過失的駕駛者應該由警局强制他陪同那傷者赴醫院或者那因傷致死的死屍到騐屍所，和他們逗留一起，一直到傷者痊癒或死者入殮，負完了法律責任，才能釋放。滬樣，他才有機會目覩他自己過失的血淋淋的後果，而起悔禍之意。聽見醫院的人說，汽車誤事而受傷的人或者因傷而死的人，其情狀是最爲可怖和悲慘的。讓那個過失的駕駛者參看一番吧。恐怕他畢生不會忘記他一手做成的慘劇，而永遠不至於重蹈覆轍了。</p>
<p>電影宣傳</p>
<p>另外，電影公司爲了協助當局維持交通起見，也可以拍攝短片，專門擋寫汽車誤事的經過，尤其是受傷者的痛苦情形和慘狀更須詳細拍攝。然後在各大戲院放映，使那些駕駛汽車的人看了知所警惕。在心理上可以提高他們的警覺，從而减少了慘劇的發生。近聞美國也極力提倡實行上述的辦法。這個辦法也許會發生極大效果的。願我治安當局注意及之。</p>

<h3>City Suburbs Near Strongholds Occupied; Communist Army Heavily Shells Datong; Fierce Battle for Niangziguan Intensifies</h3>
<p>Communist Army's Encirclement of Datong Situation Map</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] After the Communist representative of the Datong group of the Military Mediation Department left the city, the government and the American representative, considering the increasingly urgent attacks by the Communist army, the issue of safety, and the loss of a negotiating partner, requested and were approved by the Military Mediation Department, and returned to Beiping yesterday. Since the 12th, Datong city has been hit by a maximum of ten or more shells. According to reports this morning, the Communist army began a full-scale attack starting on the 14th. The strongholds of Qilicun in the south of the city, Baimacheng ten miles north of the city, and Yuhe Bridge five miles east of the city have all fallen. Wogou Chejiazhuang is currently under siege. The Communist army at Shaling, six miles southeast of the city, has been repelled. However, the Datong airport, the source of Datong's lifeline, has been directly affected by the war, and aircraft landings have lost safety.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Military sources here say that the Communist army surrounding Datong is using heavy artillery to shell the city, which has lasted for three days. The executive group of the Military Mediation Department, which left Datong by plane, has already returned to Beiping. According to government sources, the Communist army will take Datong at any cost. Others say that if the Nationalists hold Datong firmly, they can still hold out for a month even under conditions of food and ammunition shortages. The government has only airlifted a small number of reinforcements and food to Datong. It is reported that government reinforcements are heading to Datong from Baotou. The executive group of the Military Mediation Department convened a meeting of representatives of the Nationalist and Communist commanders in Taiyuan in an attempt to prevent the expansion of the war, but without result. It is reported that the Communist representative insisted that the Nationalist army must first withdraw from southern Shanxi, but this proposal was rejected by the government representative.</p>
<p>[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 17th] A newspaper here reports from Beiping that Ye Jianying, the Communist representative of the Military Mediation Department, declared at a meeting of the government, Communist, and American representatives of the Military Mediation Department that the Communist Party is not responsible for the safety of the weekly liaison plane flying from Beiping to Datong.</p>
<p>[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 17th] Today's newspaper reports that the commander of the Twelfth War Zone, Fu Zuoyi, flew to Datong yesterday to inspect the Nationalist army's defense situation. Government reconnaissance planes have repeatedly flown over Datong.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 17th] The artillery fire at Niangziguan is rapid, and the battle for control has not stopped for two days. Both sides have increased heavy troops, forming a decisive battle situation. The Communist army has occupied many hilltops and is attacking fiercely with artillery fire. Many shells have landed at the station. On the 16th, they once attacked outside Xiyangqi, west of the station. By evening, the battle had reached its most intense stage. The Nationalist army has increased reinforcements and deployed defenses along the road to ensure the communication line. On the 15th, the Communist army captured the three stations of Toumi, Xiapan, and Shanshang. After the Nationalist army reinforced, it successively recovered the three stations, but the rails and sleepers were all destroyed, and the station has become a ruin. The Communist army is also extensively destroying the railway with landmines between Niangziguan and Nanyu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 17th] According to transportation circles, the sections of the Zhengtai Railway that were destroyed by the Communist army are being repaired separately by the Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang Railway Bureaus. It is expected that traffic can be restored within a week. Currently, trains heading east from Taiyuan can reach Dongzhao. The southern section of the Tongpu Railway has been repaired, and trains heading south can reach Linfen. However, there is a section of about 200 meters between Nanguan and Fujiawan that must be traversed on foot. In addition, the railway line between Yuncheng and Fenglingdu was heavily damaged by the Communist army in the past. The local railway bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Communications to re-repair it. Insufficient equipment will be allocated by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Visits Military Mediation Department; Listens to Report on Anping Incident; Will Continue to Mediate on the Situation in China</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Ambassador Stuart, on the morning of the 17th, went to the Military Mediation Department and had a two-hour talk with Robertson on the Anping incident and the general situation. At noon, he attended a banquet for Yenching University alumni, and at 6 p.m., he attended a welcome tea party held by the Sino-American Cultural Association at Xihua Hall in the Municipal Government. As the vice president of the association (President Zhang Bojin), he made a brief speech, stating the importance of Sino-American cultural communication, without mentioning the current situation. The reporter raised several questions before the meeting, and he answered as follows: (1) There have been no telegrams exchanged with Marshal Marshall since coming to Beiping. (2) The crux of the Nationalist-Communist negotiations lies in northern Jiangsu. (3) As the situation evolves to a final critical juncture, American policy toward China may change, but how it will change will depend on the American people. (4) Although the wars in Datong or the Central Plains are fierce, there is no complete despair yet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 17th] American Ambassador Dr. Stuart Leighton, on the afternoon of the 17th, visited Robertson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying, three members of the Military Mediation Department, to listen to a report on the Anping incident.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] During the welcome reception of the Sino-American Cultural Association, the reporter met with American Ambassador Stuart Leighton and asked about the date of his trip to the south. The ambassador said that he would stay for two or three more days, and the date of departure was uncertain. The ambassador also stated that he intended to take all of his personal belongings from Yenching to Nanjing on this trip to Beijing. When the reporter asked if he would be living in Beijing for a long time, the ambassador said, "Yes." When the reporter asked the ambassador's views on the negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, the ambassador said that he was not "disappointed" and would continue to work hard to mediate after returning to Beijing. The reporter also asked if the ambassador had heard of the rumor that Marshal Marshall would be returning to the United States. Ambassador Stuart answered in fluent Mandarin: "It's all rumors, absolutely not true. Marshal Marshall's character is that he will never give up on unfinished work, and he will definitely see it through to the end and complete his mission."</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Government; Authorities are Discussing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Regarding the reorganization of the government, the general view is that the government has long been determined and that it is inevitable. As for rumors that a certain ministry will be ceded to a certain party or faction, they are unfounded and not credible. However, the authorities are currently discussing it carefully.</p>
<h3>Investigation Team for the Anping Incident Begins Work</h3>
<p>Yesterday, they Listened to the American Report All Day</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] The Twenty-Five Group officially began its investigation work on the 17th. At 9 a.m., they listened to the eyewitness report of Major Swartz of the American side of the Executive Headquarters. Major Swartz went to Tianjin on official business on July 26 and returned to Beiping on July 29 in a vehicle of the American military transport team. On the way to Anping, he was attacked along with the transport team. In his report and answers to questions, he proved that the transport team was traveling from Tianjin to Beiping without any Nationalist troops accompanying or mixed in. Before being attacked, no troops or individuals had negotiated with or stopped the team. Among those who attacked them, some wore military uniforms and some wore civilian clothes. He felt unable to describe the color of the military uniforms of some of the attackers. The Communist representative Huang Yifeng then unbuttoned his military uniform pants, revealing new gray pants underneath, and asked if it was this color. Swartz replied, "Slightly lighter." In answering questions, Swartz also stated that three days before the Anping incident, on July 26, he traveled from Beiping to Tianjin, passing through the Anping town area. The jeep he was riding in was also shot at, and they retaliated with machine guns and fired six grenade launchers. At 2 p.m., the group continued to listen to the report of Constable Duke of the American Military Police of the Executive Headquarters. He and Major Swartz were both eyewitnesses to the Anping incident. He explained that when the explosion sound came, most of the transport team's grenades were in boxes, and no one was proficient in using the machine gun on his vehicle. He also stated that the American commander was killed at the beginning of the battle. He traveled from Beiping to Tianjin on July 28 and was also shot at near Chutanggou. On the way, he encountered people in civilian clothes standing on the road carrying guns. After 4:30 p.m., the group listened to the report of Major Boer of the First Battalion of the American Marine Corps, and adjourned the meeting after 5 p.m. On the 18th, they will continue to listen to the reports of his three soldiers. The liaison group sent to the Communist area departed at 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Ye Jianying's Speech</h3>
<p>Still Need to Work for Peace</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] Ye Jianying returned to Beiping with Robertson last night. Today, he met with reporters and said that this trip to Beijing was to report on the Anping incident and had no other tasks. Marshal Marshall's attitude towards the Anping incident was extremely calm and objective. He also said that no one should deliberately publicize the incident, especially not to distort it. Marshal Marshall did not put forward a specific plan for the incident, but only said that he had seen the investigation procedure and hoped to reach an agreement quickly. When the reporter asked whether the issue of the survival of the Executive Headquarters was discussed with Marshal Marshall this time, Ye replied, "We have not considered this as a problem at all. Although the war is being fought, we still need to claim credit for peace." He further judged that Marshal Marshall would not give up before peace was achieved.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Army Recovers Xingshan in Hubei</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 17th] While the Communist army Luo Houfu's troops were about to reach a temporary ceasefire agreement with the Ninth and Thirty-second Groups, and the Nationalist army was ending military operations, they suddenly gathered their 5,000 men on the 14th, captured Xingshan County, and launched a fierce attack on Gui and Xiangxi in separate routes. The Nationalist army was unprepared and forced to retreat. It was not until yesterday afternoon that Xingshan was recovered. They are currently intercepting in separate routes.</p>
<h3>Local Militias Rise Up in Self-Defense; Communist Army in Eastern Henan Encounters Resistance; Elite Nationalist Troops Have Moved East from Luoyang</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] According to military sources who arrived in Beijing from Kaifeng today, there have been fierce battles on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway between Lanfeng and Huangkou for several days. Although Lanfeng has been captured by the Communist army, the Communist army advancing west from Lanfeng has now encountered strong resistance from the elite Nationalist troops moving east from Luoyang. The battle is taking place in the northeast area near Lanfeng. The skies above Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou are now filled with the sound of planes all day long. It is widely believed that the Nationalist army may recover Lanfeng in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Kaifeng reports that since Liu Maoen, chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, personally visited various places in eastern Henan to guide and strengthen the organization of local militias in various counties, the self-defense forces of the people in various counties in eastern Henan have become stronger. It is reported that the armed militias in Lanfeng County alone have exceeded 10,000 people. The county's militia is currently gathering in the mountainous areas on the border between Henan and Shandong, preparing to cut off the communication line between the Communist armies of the two provinces. Therefore, the Communist army that has infiltrated the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is terrified that its rear will be cut off and has become very panicked.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Military news indicates that the offensive launched by the Communist army along the Longhai Railway extends 500 miles west from Kaifeng, mobilizing more than 100,000 troops. Xinglong, the first station east of Kaifeng, was captured yesterday. The Nationalist army is still holding on to Minquan and Kaocheng, and other important stations are under siege. In addition, the Communist army Yang Yong also led more than 30,000 troops and is converging on Dangshan from northern Anhui with Liu Bocheng's troops for a fierce attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaifeng Dispatch, 16th] Liu Yizhou, deputy commander of the Henan Security Force, stated at a press conference today that the Communist army's entire strategy is to roam in central China and fight a frontal war in northern China. The roaming of Li Xiannian's troops is a containment tactic. Liu Bocheng launched the eastern Henan campaign as a frontal war with a total of 37 regiments, plus nearly 200,000 militiamen. Yang Yong has nine regiments, others are unknown. The purpose is to (1) support northern Jiangsu, (2) cut off the Longhai Railway, (3) seize Shangqiu, Kaocheng, Minquan, and Lanfeng. After obtaining these, they plan to attack Kaifeng. Our army has now begun a counterattack, and their attempt will be difficult to realize.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Air Raids Yangzhou Outskirts</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 16th] According to a reliable dispatch from Yangzhou, since the Nationalist army opened up the Yangzhou-Daqiao Highway, the war on the outskirts of Yangzhou has become quiet. On the 13th, taking advantage of the Nationalist army's troop redeployment, the Communist army launched a full-scale assault on Songjiaqiao, Lingtangqiao, and Gongdaoqiao from Shaobo and Gaoyou. The three places were successively occupied by the Communist army on the 15th. On the 15th and 16th, about 50,000 people fled from the three places to Yangzhou. Supporting the old and carrying the young, the situation was extremely miserable. The Yangzhou office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has allocated 5 million to handle emergency relief.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] It is reported here that more than 100,000 Communist army reinforcements have arrived in northern Jiangsu, attempting to launch a counterattack against the Nationalist army in the Rugao and Yangzhou area. Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army of the Northern Army, convened a meeting of senior Communist army generals in northern Jiangsu at the headquarters in Huai'an on the 13th of this month, preparing for a counterattack, with the aim of defeating the Nationalist army in Rugao and Yangzhou.</p>
<h3>Chairman Hosts Banquet for Zeng Qi and Others; Broad Exchange of General Opinions During the Dinner</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 17th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet at his official residence at 1 p.m. on the 17th for Zeng Qi, leader of the Chinese Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, a member of the party's Central Standing Committee, accompanied by Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Yunwu, Chen Zai Lei, Chen Jinghan, Wu Dingchang, and others. During the banquet, Mr. Zeng had a broad exchange of views with the Chairman and others. In addition, the Chairman inquired of the Minister of Commerce about various issues related to industry and commerce and the petition group from the Shanghai business community. Mr. Wang answered them one by one, and the Chairman expressed his satisfaction. Minister Wang also plans to report the detailed policies of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the Chairman soon. Zeng Qi is scheduled to leave Guling for Beijing before the 19th, but he said that he plans to visit the Chairman again before going down the mountain to discuss matters.</p>
<h3>Zuo Shunsheng Expresses Opinions on the National Congress Constitution Draft; Various Constitutional Issues Should be Resolved First</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, reporters visited Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, responsible persons of the Chinese Youth Party, at the headquarters of the Chinese Youth Party on Shanghai's Hague Road, to inquire about their opinions on the National Congress Constitution Draft and the reorganization of the government. They provided the following written response: Convening the National Congress is a necessary measure to end the tutelage and implement constitutional government. Now, less than three months away from the date set by the government for convening the National Congress, it is approaching in an instant. In order for the National Congress to be held more satisfactorily, it is necessary to complete the necessary preparations as soon as possible. The so-called necessary preparations are: first, to achieve national peace before the National Congress is held, so that the National Congress can proceed smoothly in a harmonious atmosphere; second, the amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft must be completed within September so that the National Congress has a basis for drafting the constitution. The sole task of the First National Congress is to draft the constitution and determine the date when the constitution will begin to be implemented. According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Constitution Draft Review Committee must, based on the principles of amending the constitution draft, create an amendment and submit it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, and then submit it to the National Congress for decision. Although the Constitution Draft Review Committee already had a "draft amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft" in Chongqing, it has not yet been fully reviewed and determined. We believe that completing the amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft is a preparation work that cannot be ignored before the National Congress is held. The Constitution Draft Review Committee should be restored as soon as possible to continue reviewing the amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft, so that it can become finalized as soon as possible. Although there are still some major issues in the amendment to the Constitution Draft, such as the issue of the powers of the central and local governments, and the issue of legislation and administration, which are still in dispute, the articles have been generally drafted. It only needs to be slightly sorted out, and various constitutional issues can be resolved in the spirit of reconciliation, and it will not be difficult to complete the work in a short period of time. If the amendment to the Constitution Draft is left unresolved, disputes may still arise at the National Congress. In the past, our country has repeatedly had disputes over the constitution-making issue, which has plunged the country into long-term chaos. If we want to have fewer disputes in constitution-making in the future, we must restore the Constitution Draft Review Committee as soon as possible to complete the amendment to the Constitution Draft. As for the issue of government reorganization, it must be carried out before the National Congress is held in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in order to innovate the political structure. The parties and social figures participating should try their best to seek a national lineup, and then they can have a fresh start and work together for peaceful nation-building.</p>

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has exchanged views with the Ministry of Economic Affairs several times in the past month on Sino-American commercial matters.

<h3>Transportation is Actively Recovering; The Construction Program will Start with Main Lines; Yu Dawei Arrives at Guling to Ask for Marshal Marshall's Support</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 17th] National railway transportation is actively recovering. (1) The Jiaoji Railway will be open to traffic in the middle of next month. (2) If there are no special obstacles on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, it is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic before the National Congress. (3) The Pinghan, Pingsui, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines are expected to be gradually restored in the short term.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guling Dispatch, 17th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei arrived at Guling from Beijing at 7 p.m. on the 17th with Director of General Affairs Li Jinglu. It is said that he intends to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to present a plan for the implementation steps of transportation reconstruction, and also intends to visit Marshal Marshall to ask for his support. According to reporters, restoring transportation is the focus of the government's current governance. The construction program will start with the main lines of the national economic artery. It is reported that although the Jiaoji Railway has been heavily damaged by the Communist army, due to the efforts of transportation workers, it is expected to be open to traffic in September. Other lines, such as Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Longhai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Pinghan, are also scheduled to be completed in order. If the Communist army accepts the instructions issued by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on August 14 and abandons its suicidal policy of obstructing transportation, the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai lines may be the first to be opened to traffic within the year. At present, steel rails and sleepers are the most lacking materials, and business funding is also tight, but the competent authorities will spare no effort to connect the economic arteries of the country in order to achieve their goals as scheduled.</p>

<h3>"Darkness Envelops China" – American Public Opinion Believes Armed Conflict Is Inevitable; CCP Newspapers Emphasize "War" and "Attack"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] The devastation and tragic situation under a full-scale war is almost inevitable. Today, the Communist side does not shy away from using words like "war" and "attack." This afternoon, this reporter visited the Communist Party spokesperson at the Military Mediation Department. With considerable enthusiasm, he introduced yesterday's editorial in the Communist Party's official newspaper, *Liberation Daily*. The editorial demanded that all military personnel and civilians in the "Liberated Areas" recognize the seriousness of the current situation, mobilize uniformly, and "crush the National Army." It further stated that only by defeating the National Army could "peace" and "democracy" be achieved. In addition to emphasizing war as the only way to resolve the current situation, the editorial also criticized "the United States, which consistently advocates mediation with a smooth tongue, as the helper and supporter of China's civil war." The article also directs the missions of various Communist Party units.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent, New York, 11th (Airmail)] The *New York Times*, in its editorial titled "Darkness Envelops China," stated that "Marshal [George] Marshall and Ambassador [John Leighton] Stuart issued a joint statement saying that they have found no way to peacefully resolve China's increasingly rampant civil war. This paints a dark picture of China's future. Five hundred million people are defying their own will and risking complete economic collapse by engaging in a reckless struggle because the leaders of two opposing forces refuse to accept a common plan regarding local government and troop reorganization. This is unimaginable to people of goodwill throughout the world. Darkness is clearly descending upon China and casting its shadow over the entire world. Perhaps, in the nine-year struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, achieving peace is no longer possible. Perhaps the opposing ideologies that seem to be dividing the world have made the use of force inevitable. Perhaps Marshal Marshall's mission has indeed failed, and the Chinese Communist Party will succeed. However, there may still be one hope: that the American mediator's explicit expression of pessimism and the inevitable facts they foresee can make Chinese political leaders feel their full responsibility and avoid the final catastrophe. Perhaps the painful cries of the Chinese people who long for peace can finally penetrate the solid walls of Yan'an and Nanjing. From here, it is useless to determine where the blame lies. However, the important fact is that the Nationalist government represents four-fifths of China's population, and Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek] has shown a tendency toward coordination, but there is a limit. Beyond this limit, even this wise leader dares not venture further. The Communist Party has also respected this limit, but now it has crossed this line and openly attacked the American army. The Communist Party, as a smaller group, demands equal or even superior power in any organized government, while in the areas it currently controls, it effectively practices autonomy. They do not seem to fear the war and turmoil that are otherwise inevitable. In this chaotic situation of opposition, Marshal Marshall has frankly admitted that his efforts have failed. If we withdraw aid and guidance to China, there is little hope for the future of this tragic country."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] News from China indicates that this tragically destined country is on the brink of a full-scale civil war. The future situation in Europe seems more promising compared to China. One of America's major post-war plans is about to be declared a failure. If American policy changes, a complete withdrawal from China is not impossible. If that happens, all the hopes that the Chinese people and their allies held during the fourteen years of resistance against Japan will vanish. China's arduous and heroic resistance was largely sustained by this hope. If a full-scale civil war is unavoidable, China will become a vacuum in terms of politics, economy, and ideology. Forces vying for world leadership or seeking world domination will inevitably take advantage of this vacuum, and some of these forces may be drawn in against their initial wishes.</p>
<p>Capital Street Talk and Public Opinion: Blame the CCP for Lacking Sincerity</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] People on the streets of Nanjing, such as shop assistants, hotel waiters, and restaurant staff, today generally believe that Marshal Marshall's mission has failed, largely due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. The general consensus is that "Marshal Marshall is a capable man, perhaps the most capable man in America. Unfortunately, the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is too deep to resolve. The Communist Party insists that Marshal Marshall only represents the Kuomintang, which is the reason for his failure." Those who express this view still hold a deeply rooted belief that the Communist Party's inability to compromise is manipulated by Soviet influence. However, many also believe that American military equipment and munitions have fueled the Chinese civil war. Staunch supporters of the Kuomintang deny this. Most people in Nanjing also believe that a constitutional democratic government composed of truly democratically elected officials is still vaguely in the distant future, and even if it comes, it will only exist in name and not in reality. These people also say that the Kuomintang should be a major party in China, but it should not be the only party, and others should get a piece of the pie in the government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek remains the only reasonable leader of the country. (For news on the Communist Party spokesperson's comments on Marshal Marshall's work, please see page 2.)</p>

<h3>Facilitating Trade Between Inside and Outside the Customs; The Northeast Headquarters Economic Commission Formulates Four Measures; Also Opens Exchange and Regulates Commercial Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] In the year since the recovery of the Northeast, what can be... to open up, and trade with the interior has been unceasing. Since the recovery of the Northeast last year, transportation has been disrupted, and the political situation has been unstable. The daily necessities of people in the Northeast have been relying on past savings and small quantities of goods carried by merchants. This situation is gradually becoming scarce. In order to change the abnormal economic situation and integrate the economies inside and outside the customs, the Economic Commission of the Headquarters has formulated and announced trade measures starting from the 15th, including interim measures for commercial goods entering and exiting, interim measures for railway cargo transportation, interim implementation measures for industrial and commercial exchange in the nine northeastern provinces, and interim measures for inspecting export commercial goods. Trade between inside and outside the customs, which had been suspended for many years, can now be facilitated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] A spokesperson for the Economic Commission, in a talk on facilitating trade and currency exchange between inside and outside the customs, stated that since the recovery of the Northeast, trade with the interior has not yet been restored. The difficulties are: first, enemy and puppet materials have not been completely received and inventoried, to prevent private transportation and loss; second, there is an urgent need for vehicles, and restrictions must be placed on commercial exports; third, there is a shortage of transportation; and fourth, exchange has not yet been opened. In order to urgently seek solutions, the Chief Executive's Office has now stopped inspecting commercial goods, and military transport vehicles are also being used as much as possible for commercial transportation. Currently, four provisional measures have been established: (1) Regarding the classification of export goods, export goods are divided into three categories: "ordinary," "permitted," and "specially permitted." All goods other than "permitted" and "specially permitted" are ordinary goods and are not subject to...; (2) Regarding the priority of cargo transportation, everyone has equal opportunities to avoid backlogs. Government and industrial... enjoy priority, and commercial goods that are more important in nature can also obtain the same rights; (3) The inspection targets determined this time only require merchants to prove that the goods are not privately held or stolen enemy and puppet materials. Clearance will be granted as long as there is a shop guarantee; (4) Regarding remittance measures, in the past, the scope of remittances from the Northeast to the interior was limited to public funds and living expenses for civil servants' families. Now that the currency system is gradually returning to normal and commercial transportation has also been opened, special implementation measures for remittances have been formulated in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Exchange in the Nine Northeastern Provinces" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. All legitimate merchants who comply with the regulations for commercial goods entering and exiting and exchange can apply for remittances. Industrial remittances above one million yuan and commercial remittances above five hundred thousand yuan can be applied for through banks, and exchange can be settled if the banks deem them legitimate. The exchange rate will be posted by the Central Bank at any time.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Communist Army's Deliberate Breaching of the Dike; Air Force Headquarters Refutes Communist Slander</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Communist Party's propaganda organ, Xinhua News Agency, published a message on the 11th, stating that the government's air force bombed the Grand Canal dike, causing a flood in northern Jiangsu, with the intention of blaming the government for the responsibility of the implementation in northern Jiangsu. For this reason, this reporter visited the spokesperson of the Political Department of the Air Force Headquarters to ask for his reaction to Xinhua News Agency's malicious slander and fabrication. He stated as follows: Anyone with a little political common sense knows that the false propaganda fabricated by Xinhua News Agency is purely a consistent Communist policy of concealment and malicious slander, attempting to distort the facts of the dike-breaching atrocity that arouses public indignation and shift responsibility to the government. We can interpret the Communist Party's sinister actions of deliberately breaching the dike and flooding 300 square kilometers of land in northern Jiangsu as follows: (1) The Communist army has repeatedly suffered defeats in northern Jiangsu, and their conspiracies have failed. In order to prevent the National Army from continuing its counterattack and to try to reverse the military decline, they had no choice but to deliberately breach the Grand Canal dike between July 31 and August 2, causing a serious flood and destroying highways and bridges in an attempt to prevent the National Army from advancing further; (2) The Communist Party's consistent goal is to seize political power by force, and its greatest conspiracy is to create widespread poverty in the country, disrupt social order, and destroy the rural economy, creating a wasteland so as to force the good people under their tyrannical rule to join their organization and use them as sacrifices to expand their territory. Such despicable propaganda is not worth a smile from those who are knowledgeable. The department also broadcast to the whole country on the evening of the 17th, clarifying the truth about the dike-breaching and criticizing the Communist Party's fallacies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangsu, 17th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference recently telegraphed Zhou Enlai, the Communist Party representative, requesting an end to the Communist army's dike-breaching and flooding in Northern Jiangsu, which has been increasing, and requesting a prompt telegram to the Communist army leaders in Northern Jiangsu to effectively stop it and change course to protect the lives of the people.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 17th] The Hebei border rivers have frequently been subjected to Communist army dike-breaching. There are a total of 19 breached dikes in Cangxian on the South Canal, Wuqing on the North Canal, Xianxian on the Ziya River, and Xincheng and Liangxiang on the Daqing River, flooding more than 20 counties in total. The Hebei Provincial Government has reported these facts to the Military Mediation Department.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th] Liu Yongfang, the government representative of the 24th Traffic Group of the Military Mediation Department, submitted a memorandum to the group regarding the Communist army's destruction of the Grand Canal dike and the flooding of the eastern section of the Suihai Highway, requesting an inspection.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie Diligently Seeks Hidden Information; Inspects Water Conservancy and Reclamation in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shaoxing, 17th] The Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Shen Honglie, left by car from [unknown] at Jingjiang Station in Xiaoshan on the morning of the 16th with a small entourage. Accompanied by the county magistrate of Xiaoshan and more than ten representatives of villagers, he inspected the Changxing Seawall, going back and forth under bean trellises and melon racks, and between interconnected fields. He inspected the Xijiang Dike and the Panjian and Pantou, which were three miles away from the dike. The shallow beach here has been eroded by the river water, and many of the Panjian and Pantou have collapsed. Shen explained the reasons for the river course modification and said that experts would be sent here to conduct research and surveys. The village representatives knelt and begged that the designated site for the airport be moved back to the original old airport. Shen then went to inspect the designated site and saw that it was located in the riverside area, with fertile land and cotton waiting to be harvested. More than a hundred people burned incense and knelt around, crying and pleading as before, their condition being very pitiful. Shen comforted them greatly and promised to consult with the aviation authorities. After asking about this year's crops and cotton harvest, he boarded the car to Xiaoshan. After arriving in Xiaoshan, he met with various legal groups and public opinion organizations, asking about the hardships of the people. Everyone said that the water conservancy problem was serious, with tens of thousands of disaster victims unable to make a living. Shen gave instructions and asked them to find ways to reclaim wasteland. Shen was still reviewing documents at lunchtime. In the afternoon, he inspected various agencies, walking more than ten li throughout the city, sweating profusely. Later, he went to the west of the city to climb Qiukou Stone to overlook Xiang Lake, which was mostly barren and silted up. Shen believed that Xiang Lake was nearby and had great development value, and it could be cultivated as a scenic area. He immediately gave some instructions, then hired a foot-rowed boat to return to the station along Xiang Lake. On the way, he inquired about the lives of the [unknown] thirty sons, showing great concern. At the station, he met many military officer trainees and inquired about their living conditions and future destinations, showing great concern. Later, he took a car to Shaoxing, where thousands of people lined the streets to welcome him. He immediately went to the county chamber of commerce to meet with party groups, various legal groups, and public opinion organizations. At midnight, he consulted the commissioner and county magistrate about security and other issues. The county magistrates of Shangyu and Zhuji were also present until late at night. Shen strictly refused local hospitality on this trip, and his life was very simple. He stayed in Shaoxing for about two days.</p>
<h3>Henan Fellow Townsmen Appeal for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Establishment of Shanghai Fundraising Committee</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Henan Natives Association in Shanghai and the representatives of the Henan Disaster Situation Appeal Group, Fan Zhengbo, Zhang Fang, Zhang Honglie, Li Hongyi, Lü Yunru, Wang Jingxiu, and Shi Zongzhou, yesterday hosted a gathering for people from all walks of life at the Pudong Natives Association to report on the real situation of the Henan disaster.

<h3>CCP Spokesperson Comments on Marshal Marshall's Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] A Communist Party spokesperson tonight formally stated that they would "review" the merits and demerits of Marshal Marshall's mediation work and provide criticism. The spokesperson also denied that this contained any "attack" intention. This move by the Communist Party is obviously putting mental pressure on Marshal Marshall to force Marshal Marshall to submit, which is conducive to the Communist Party's unilateral opinion, so as to implement the four agreements of the truce agreement, the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and the troop reorganization plan. The spokesperson accused Marshal Marshall, saying that in the first period from December last year to March this year, Marshal Marshall's mediation work was to faithfully implement the mission of Truman's statement and complete the four agreements, and the results were gratifying. In the second period, after Marshal Marshall returned to the United States and returned, the work was biased towards one side, the mediation lacked principles, did not achieve the due effort, and did not follow Truman's statement. Truman's statement was agreed upon at the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and Marshal Marshall was also present at the conference. The spokesperson did not give a definite indication on whether Truman's statement would be submitted to the Security Council for resolution if it could not be implemented. The Communist Party hopes that Marshal Marshall will continue to work hard to implement the four agreements and faithfully follow Truman's statement. Finally, the Communist Party expressed great respect for Marshal Marshall personally and his past achievements.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Communist Party has begun to publicly accuse Marshal Marshall of being unfair in the Kuomintang-Communist mediation. According to reliable information: At the three-party conference in Moscow, Molotov once told Byrnes that the Soviet and Chinese representatives should jointly mediate the Northeast issue with the representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resolve the Chinese dispute, because Molotov believed that the Northeast was the center of the Chinese problem. However, Byrnes did not express his opinion at that time. Judging from today's Communist Party's instigation of anti-Americanism and criticism of Marshal Marshall, we can know that their motives did not start today.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Swindle Occurs in Hankou; Old Woman Zhang Organizes a Hui (Rotating Credit Association) and Absorbs 1.3 Billion Legal Tender; Extorting Heavy Interest and Appearing to Be a Wealthy Magnate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 17th] In the midst of high-interest borrowing, a bizarre swindle has recently occurred here. An old woman named Zhang Feng, known as Zhang Taipo (Granny Zhang, who used to work as a matchmaker), at No. 7 Xianghe Lane in Hankou, owns more than a dozen young girls. After the victory, she innovated by organizing a *hui* (rotating credit association), inviting business people and women to organize *hui* groups, with a total of more than 1,700, absorbing more than 1.3 billion legal tender. Zhang then used this to extract heavy interest and appeared to be a wealthy magnate. Unexpectedly, recently, three installments of interest were not paid. The invited members discovered the inside story and gathered more than 500 creditors yesterday to collect debts at Zhang's house. Vehicles gathered together, making the road inaccessible. Zhang was flustered and had no choice but to reply evasively. The creditors had no way to solve the problem and are now requesting the district office and security authorities to strictly clear the warehouse.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Solve the Problem of Students Being Out of School</h3>
<p>In the previous press conference of the Shanghai Municipal Government, we heard Mayor Wu's talk about the problem of primary and secondary school students in this city being out of school, and we deeply felt its seriousness. First, the cost of living has risen sharply, and tuition fees for general private primary and secondary schools will increase. Families with meager incomes will find it difficult to continue to afford their children's education expenses. Now, there are only half a month left before the start of the autumn semester. We can hear parents around us who have no money, worrying day and night about their children's education, feeling almost restless and having no way out. Second, there is the issue of the number of schools. Although there seem to be many public and private schools in Shanghai, since the victory, people from all directions have brought their old and young to Shanghai. According to Mayor Wu's report, the current population of Shanghai is almost 4.5 million. The number of schools is small, and the number of school-age children is large. Therefore, if parents or students slightly neglect the procedures for applying for admission, they risk being excluded from the school. Also, because there are many candidates and the number of places in each school is limited, the admission process has to be strict, so there are many students who fail, and they are pitifully terrified of being out of school. We can see countless young people around us who are currently rushing around in the scorching heat, registering in the east and registering in the west, taking exams in the east and taking exams in the west, worrying like pounding rice, so anxious about whether they will be accepted that they are almost beside themselves. It is very pitiful. Especially when this summer vacation has not yet passed, and the dynamics of students entering school are appropriately chaotic and turbulent, we can see very clearly that this problem of being out of school is indeed quite serious.</p>
<p>However, from our objective point of view, the problem of Shanghai youths being out of school is not absolutely unsolvable. In the current urgent situation, we must have temporary solutions, and when everything improves in the future, we must have fundamental solutions. Education is the most important foundation for establishing a country, and Shanghai is the largest city in the country. The municipal authorities of this city are willing to tirelessly study the problem of being out of school and express their anxiety at all times, which truly makes us feel infinitely concerned at the same time.</p>
<p>Regarding temporary solutions, we believe that if we divide all primary and secondary schools in the city into three shifts, we can implicitly increase the number of schools threefold. These three shifts consist of two shifts during the day and one shift at night. The two-shift system during the day was very popular in Shanghai for a while after August 13th, when the National Army withdrew from Shanghai and before the enemy occupied the concessions. Except that parents of younger children inevitably feel a little troubled because they have to manage them due to the shorter time at school, there are no other problems. Until now, it is said that there are still a few schools that have such a class schedule. Many European countries are also adopting the two-shift system during the day. For example, in Poland after the catastrophe, because many school buildings and equipment were destroyed by artillery fire, the schools adopted this two-shift system. As for the one shift at night, the United Kingdom and the United States especially value it. The government has never discriminated against universities and middle schools that hold classes at night in terms of conservative traditions in legal aspects. There are many important people in the United States today who graduated from night school. A New York dispatch from the United States Information Service on the 7th of this month said: "A survey by the American Night School Association of colleges with night classes found that the number of veterans enrolled in night schools has increased by 1,237 percent compared to a year ago, and the total number of students has also increased by 50 percent compared to a year ago." Then, why is it that a poor country like ours is unwilling to use the light of the night and unwilling to face the reading of the night? This one shift at night does not cost much, and older students can also do some work at home or elsewhere, and teachers, if they are physically strong, can also use this additional income to subsidize their families. In short, as long as we are willing to abandon prejudices and discard traditional concepts, as long as we are willing to endure hardship and practice a frugal method, and as long as everyone concentrates their efforts to promote a three-shift education system per day, we will definitely be able to dilute the serious problem of being out of school in Shanghai a lot.</p>
<p>However, we do not want to permanently implement a three-shift system per day for education that seeks development in hardship. At the same time, we must also establish fundamental and permanent solutions to the problem of being out of school. Given the difficulty of our country's finances and the small amount of educational funding, the government does not have huge economic power to monopolize education. Therefore, encouraging social groups or private citizens to run schools universally to help the government complete its mission in education is absolutely necessary in the future. If we want to achieve this goal, we must drastically change our policies and abolish all the trivial laws that have caused trouble, pain, and restrictions on social groups or private individuals running schools. Under the current system, the government's strict laws on private schools and the world's education systems for the procedures of registration, and the strict and thorough treatment of private schools, China can be considered the first. India is still a British colony, but the freedom to run schools in India, overseas Chinese in India know this. We want to popularize education and fundamentally solve the problem of being out of school. Unless the government is determined to monopolize it, if it still looks at those who are enthusiastic about running schools with special eyes, few people will be willing to take their own energy and act like lunatics to run schools for the country again. Today, the education authorities are making things difficult for the registration of private schools in every possible way, which is a fact known and felt painfully by the education community. If this pain is once relieved, coupled with the gradual elimination of situations such as housing shortages and the gradual improvement of the national economy, all schools across the country, after gaining freedom, will definitely spring up like mushrooms after rain and work together to fundamentally eliminate the problem of being out of school for Shanghai and the entire country, and complete the great cause of educational construction.</p>
<p>In short, in China at present and in the future, if we want to popularize education and improve education, we must use this revolutionary method, and we must implement some new methods that adapt to the environment and calculate frugally. If the government does not have the魄力 to stipulate a large amount of funding for education, but is unwilling to change its policies, it is tantamount to strangling the opportunity for our young people to receive universal education. We believe that in the future, the national education policy, in addition to concentrating efforts on selecting and running a number of national universities or provincial and municipal middle schools for demonstration purposes, should relax the standards and encourage social public or private establishments of schools at all levels as much as possible to make up for the deficiencies of national, provincial, and municipal schools. And the government's academic performance of all students should be measured by fair and impartial examination methods, regardless of whether the school is established by the government, social groups, or individuals. Those who pass will graduate, and those who fail will take remedial courses. China's traditional habits have never underestimated the private education undertakings of the people. We still advocate using social public and private methods to save the government's predicament of insufficient number of government-run schools. Changing course is the time now!</p>

<h3>Bengbu City Commerce on the Verge of Crisis: Chamber of Commerce Representatives Go to Beijing to Request Loans</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Bengbu correspondent] Since the recovery of Bengbu City last year, the commerce of Bengbu City has been greatly affected by the disturbance of short-term counterfeit currency. Later, the bandits and communists in the nearby counties were rampant, traffic was blocked, and cargo transportation was not smooth. All industries plummeted. This summer, the Yellow River flooded and backflowed into the Huai River, turning the Huai River region into a swamp. Locusts were everywhere in the highlands, and the disaster was thus developed. The goods on the market could not be sold, and business was virtually suspended. Therefore, high-interest loans were borrowed to maintain the status quo, drinking poison to quench thirst. Some went bankrupt. In view of this, the Bengbu City Chamber of Commerce specially elected Standing Director Peng Zhuoru and others to travel south to Beijing on the 15th to petition the central government for relief. At the same time, it petitioned the Ministry of Finance to order the Four Joint Offices to turn around and instruct the banks in Bengbu City to handle low-interest mortgage loans, and to exempt or reduce the profit tax for the 34th year to save the crisis.</p>

<h3>Situation in India Worsens: Large Number of British Troops Enter Calcutta; Nearly 2,000 Killed and Wounded in Two Days of Riots</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] New Delhi, 17th direct broadcast: The situation in India is even worse today. There are major conflicts between Indian and Muslim believers in Calcutta and other places, and fires have broken out in many places. A large number of British troops have entered Calcutta today. According to the latest statistics, 250 people died and 1,600 were injured as a result of the two days of riots.</p>
<p>Another report: Nehru met with Indian Governor-General Wavell today to discuss the formation of an interim Indian government.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] Paris, 17th broadcast New Delhi news: Nehru recently met with Lord Wavell, the Governor-General of India, for an hour and a quarter, and the discussion involved the examination of matters related to the formation of an interim government. After the meeting, Nehru immediately reported the content to the leaders of the Congress Party, but neither side made any comments. The rumor that telegraphic communication between Calcutta and New Delhi was cut off by demonstrators has been denied by the local authorities. The disruption of traffic is probably due to the fact that the Calcutta police do not allow office workers to go to public places. There are troops guarding the Calcutta Post Office, and office workers will go there under the escort of troops.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper comprehensive news] The situation in India has become more serious yesterday. According to a United Press report, Congress Party leader Nehru told reporters yesterday (16th) after meeting with Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, that he had tried to find a compromise plan with the Muslim League regarding the formation of a joint government, but it had failed. Nehru returned to New Delhi on the 17th to report on the progress to the Congress Party, but the rejection of the Muslim League Chairman Jinnah to participate in the organization of the interim government was also expected and did not surprise the general public. According to a Reuters report from London on the 16th, it is generally expected that the formation of the Congress Party government is no longer a problem, and it is said that if the Congress Party can leave the chairmanship to wait for the participation of the Muslim League, then Jinnah may change his original intention and agree to participate.</p>
<p>While the two sides have not yet found a compromise plan, Muslim parades and demonstrations and riots have occurred in Bombay, Bengal, Calcutta, etc. In Calcutta, a very large-scale conflict occurred. According to a Reuters report from New Delhi on the 16th and a United Press report from Calcutta, the 16th was designated by the Muslim League as "Direct Action Day" to protest the interim government plan set by the British Cabinet delegation, and as a result, a major conflict occurred in Calcutta. Most of the trains and streetcars in Calcutta stopped running. The offices of the Congress Party and the two Congress Party newspapers were destroyed by the Muslim masses. Robberies and stabbings occurred one after another. According to reports from the four major hospitals in Calcutta, 80 people have died and 825 have been injured. The reports from other hospitals have not yet been released and have not been calculated. All day on the 16th, Calcutta was shrouded in an atmosphere of terror. British troops in Bombay were also on alert all day, but fortunately there were no disputes. Large-scale public rallies were also held in Bangalore, Sindh, Lahore, etc.</p>

<p>[Reuters Batavia 17th] The authorities have taken strict precautions on Indonesian Independence Day. All commemoration ceremonies and parades are not allowed to be held. Even the unveiling ceremony of the Independence Monument in the residence of Indonesian Prime Minister Shari is not allowed. Shari arrived here by train from the interior of Java last night and claimed that he had not yet formed a cabinet. He will return to Yogyakarta in a week. The news that Indonesian President Sukarno is feeling unwell due to high blood pressure and that someone was trying to assassinate him is not true. Allied authorities have ordered their officers and soldiers not to go out after 9:00 pm. A military parade was scheduled to be held today in Yogyakarta, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia in central Java.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Batavia 16th special dispatch] Indonesian President Sukarno is authorizing Shari to form a cabinet. After the establishment of this cabinet, the full power that Sukarno has held since July 3 will be relinquished.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Batavia 16th] According to a semi-official Dutch statement here, six East Indian natives attempted to assassinate Indonesian President Sukarno half a month ago but failed. Two of the assassins were killed by guards in front of the president's residence in Yogyakarta. The other four fled in panic. According to recent announcements by the Central Java Radio Station, a large number of people have been arrested, which may be related to the Sukarno assassination case.</p>

<h3>President Truman Clarifies Policy on Palestine: Hopes that Britain, Arabs, and Jews Negotiate a Solution; Bill to Allow Jewish Refugees to Enter Under Consideration</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper comprehensive news] According to a United Press report from London on the 16th: Well-informed sources believe that the British government may be preparing to hand over the Palestine issue to the United Nations, because Britain feels that it is unable to deal with this serious problem that threatens Britain's economic lifeline in the Middle East alone. According to a Reuters report from Paris, British Colonial Secretary Hall flew to Paris on the 16th after meeting with Jewish leaders to discuss the matter with Bevin. Bevin also met with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes to discuss the Palestine issue. At this time, all parties are focusing on the attitude of the United States. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Washington on the 16th, President Truman told the press on the 16th that solving the Palestine issue still cannot solve the problem of arranging 100,000 European Jews. I will request the Senate and House of Representatives to pass a special bill to allow some Jewish and non-Jewish refugees to move to the United States to live. The U.S. government is unwilling to put forward any plan for solving the Palestine issue, but deeply hopes that the talks between the British, Arab, and Jewish parties can achieve a satisfactory solution. According to a Reuters report, the British government is currently focusing on preparing for the convening of the London Conference to allow representatives of the Arab and Jewish communities to participate in the discussion of solving the Palestine issue.</p>

Mr. Wang announced two items on today's agenda: (1) the Austrian government's request to present its views at the conference regarding the division of the Austro-Italian border; (2) the Iranian government's request to participate in the Peace Conference. After the agenda was approved, British representative McNeil immediately stood up to speak in support of Austria's request, while the Soviet representative expressed opposition. It was then passed by a vote of 15 to 6, allowing Austria to present its views. The General Assembly then discussed Iran's request. Vyshinsky pointed out that the major powers should recognize Iran's assistance to the United Nations. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi supported the Soviet proposal, pointing out that Iran was one of the few Asian countries participating in the United Nations. The American representative, Cohen, held the same view, and Iran's request was unanimously approved. Before the adjournment, the chairman announced that the two political and territorial committees for Bulgaria and Hungary would meet at 3:00 PM today. The next General Assembly will be chaired on rotation by French President Pidault.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive News] Since its commencement, the Paris Peace Conference has lasted for three weeks, during which most of the time has been spent discussing procedural matters, listening to speeches and debates by representatives from various countries, and inviting representatives from the former enemy states of Italy, Romania, Germany, Bulgaria, and Finland to attend the conference and provide opinions. Representatives from some countries are quite dissatisfied with the slow progress of the Peace Conference. At the conference on the 16th, New Zealand representative Jordan opposed delaying political matters, leading to a heated debate with Soviet representative Vyshinsky. However, the confirmation of the chairmen and vice-chairmen of various committees of the Paris Peace Conference yesterday can be regarded as a major progress of the conference, and the actual work will begin from here.</p>

<p>According to United Press, the Italian Political and Territorial Committee held its first meeting on the 13th of this month and began discussing the draft treaty on the 16th. The chairman of the committee, South African representative Ettlinger, proposed three points: (1) postpone the discussion of the preamble to the peace treaty and discuss it after the text; (2) request Italy to submit written memoranda on all disputed points; (3) adopt a procedure so that all representatives can submit memoranda on the disputed points in the treaty. According to Reuters, the Peace Conference decided on the 16th that the amendments to the draft resolution on Trieste determined by the four powers will be submitted to the Italian Political and Territorial Committee for discussion next Tuesday, which is likely to cause a fierce debate at the Peace Conference on the Trieste issue.</p>
<p>U.S. Senators Connally and Vandenberg, at the summons of Secretary of State Byrnes, set sail for France yesterday on the "Queen Mary." Before departure, he said, "The Soviet Union has adopted an unreasonable attitude at the Paris Peace Conference," and said, "It is impossible for the Peace Conference and the United Nations General Assembly to be held at the same time, and one of them must be postponed." In summary, the Peace Conference will enter a more tense stage, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<h3>Japanese Admiral Sato Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>First Shoots Wife and Children with a Handgun</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yokosuka, 17th, United Press] Japanese Admiral Sato Shiro, 53, former supreme commander of the Japanese Navy in the Wewak war zone of New Guinea, recently shot and killed his 41-year-old wife, 11-year-old son, and 8-year-old daughter with a handgun, and then shot himself in the head. This must have been a planned suicide. According to reports, Sato returned to Japan after being demobilized last spring and suffered from malaria.

<h3>U.S. Prepares to Send a Note to the Soviet Union Opposing Soviet Control of the Tatar Strait. Frequent Diplomatic Contacts Between Turkey, Britain, and the United States.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive News] According to United Press and Reuters, Ankara, Turkey, 16th, the Turkish government's reply to the Soviet Union's note requesting joint defense of the Tatar Strait has been drafted and will be submitted to Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov today or tomorrow. According to reliable sources, Turkey will reject the Soviet request and insist that the jurisdiction of the Tatar Strait should be entirely determined by the Montreux Convention mechanism. Since receiving the Soviet request, Turkey has been closely consulting with Western countries. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Wilson and British Ambassador to Turkey Kelly have been in frequent contact with Turkish Foreign Minister Saka, and French Ambassador to Turkey Magras has also visited the Turkish Foreign Minister to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Regarding the U.S. attitude on this issue, according to United Press, San Francisco, 17th, Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States may send a note to the Soviet Union, declaring the U.S. attitude on the country's request to amend the Montreux Convention for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Tatar Strait. Mr. Acheson also said that the United States would oppose this Soviet request. The U.S. policy on this issue has been announced by Byrnes, that the United States supports unrestricted passage of Soviet ships through the Tatar Strait, but opposes the Soviet Union obtaining bases in the strait. However, according to United Press, Washington, 16th, some people here privately expressed that the Soviet Union must obtain military bases in the Tatar Strait and is unwilling to give up its purpose, and it is feared that it will not be easy to find another compromise. According to London, 17th broadcast: The Soviet newspaper Pravda endorsed the Soviet Union's request in an editorial, saying that it is to safeguard the important interests of the Black Sea countries, and non-Black Sea countries should immediately stop interfering in the administration of the straits. The Soviet Union has the longest coastline in the Black Sea and naturally has the greatest right to self-defense in prohibiting the entry of navies from non-Black Sea countries.</p>
<h3>U.S. Public Opinion Poll: Supports Taking a Firm Stand Against the Soviet Union and Believes That the Soviet Union Wants to Go on to Dominate the World</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th Dispatch] The American Institute of Public Opinion, known for the Gallup poll, announced today that the diplomatic battle between the United States and the Soviet Union has a significant impact on the American people's views on how the United States should deal with the Soviet Union.

In general, Americans feel that the Soviet Union is not only trying to defend its borders, but also wants to go on to dominate the world. According to the results of the most recent survey: among those tested, 71 percent oppose Soviet foreign policy, and 60 percent believe that the Soviet Union is trying to make its country a dominant world power. The poll also found an important fact, that the Soviet Union's policies are even less popular among prominent Americans.

Based on the statistical figures obtained from Bikini, he said: "Conclusions that can affect ship design, naval and air tactics, and strategies can be obtained."</p>
<h3>Sulphur Island Suffers Extremely Heavy Damage from Typhoon</h3>

<h3>Heavy Rain Causes Disaster in Illinois, USA</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, 17th] Heavy rain in Illinois caused the largest flood since 1915, and the southern districts were a vast expanse of water.

<h3>English Writer Wells Cremated in London. Shaw Speaks in Mourning.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The remains of English writer Wells were cremated today at the Golders Green Crematorium in London. In addition to family members, Lord Beaverbrook and others were also present. Shaw's eulogy for his deceased friend stated: Wells was not a gentleman. He was the son of a florist and a sexton, so he was a person without class, never imitating the demeanor of a gentleman, clerk, or teacher, but always maintained his personal character, being gentle, outspoken, and not glared at by people. About 50 years ago, I disagreed with him on the policies of the Fabian Society. Although I defeated him, everyone in the society expressed sympathy for him, which shows that he was loved by everyone.</p>
<h3>Scientists Gather in London to Study the Secrets of Longevity. Men Can Be Transformed into Women.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] British and European scientists are now holding a conference in London to discuss the issue of prolonging human life. Professor Crew of Britain said: It is possible to temporarily transform male infants into females to prolong their lives, because the competitive survival function of boys is weaker than that of girls. The problem now is whether it is possible to inject hormones to temporarily transform males into females to help them survive the dangerous period of competition. Dr. Kolantchevsky, secretary of the British Longevity Research Association, said: The goal of immortality is not only to prolong life, but also to maintain strength forever. Infancy is only the beginning of life, and we need to study all stages of life. The use of glandular serum by Soviet Bogomolets to seek rejuvenation did not yield satisfactory results and could only provide temporary stimulation. Therefore, what we need to study is to discover the causes of aging and remedy them, not just to stimulate degraded fibers.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Council to Reopen at the End of This Year. Heated Debate Over Refugee Case.</h3>
<p>Accelerating Relief to China to be Continued</p>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 16th] The fifth plenary meeting of the UNRRA Council adjourned this afternoon and is scheduled to reopen at the end of the year. The time and location will be decided by the General Affairs Committee.

In name, UNRRA's refugee resettlement work will not stop until June 30, 1947, but Mr. Lai said at the last meeting that UNRRA personnel will be reorganized to coordinate its activities with international repatriation work. Unfinished matters, such as accelerating relief to China, remain to be dealt with. British representative Buck said: The 14,700 employees representing 40 countries will mostly find a way out in international institutions.</p>
<h3>The Confusing Indian Political Situation Our Newspaper Editorial Office (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Problem: Pakistan</p>
<p>The British Empire sees that the Indian issue has reached a point where it must be resolved. As the authoritative "Forum Weekly" said: "This is our last chance to withdraw from India as friends." On March 15, Prime Minister Attlee made a world-shocking announcement in the House of Commons: "Britain has now granted India full independent status within or outside the British Empire. If India wishes to sever its relationship with the Empire through free elections, Britain will assist India in completing this move." On March 23, the inland delegation composed of Secretary of State for India Affairs Lawrence, Naval Minister Alexander, and Trade Minister Cripps arrived in India. Unfortunately, when independence was still a distant dream, the Congress Party and the Muslim League had already drawn swords and become a mess. Both sides began a fierce debate, attacking, ridiculing, cursing, threatening, and even threatening to "fight at all costs." For these messy and chaotic claims, we can still sum up in two aspects. First, in terms of administration, the Congress Party advocates a free and unified central government that includes all aspects, while the Muslim League insists on partition. Second, in terms of constitution-making, the Congress Party hopes to first establish a single constitutional assembly in India, including all aspects. Partition will only be allowed when the assembly does not advocate unity. The Muslim League believes that the northwest and northeast regions of India should be partitioned, and Muslims should separately organize a constitutional assembly to draft their own constitution.</p>
<p>The crux of the matter is still this unresolved "Pakistan." The Muslim League has threatened to say "If we do not partition, we would rather have civil war." After the British delegation arrived in India, it proposed a proposal to organize a temporary coalition government and allow the division of Muslim and non-Muslim areas in each province. After many lip-smacking meetings and disputes, the Muslim League still believed that this was still a situation of Hindu majority rule and insisted on implementing its own "Pakistan" partition proposal. The meeting then broke up without results on May 12.</p>
<p>Since the meeting broke down, Prime Minister Attlee read a white paper in the House of Commons on the afternoon of May 16, announcing the latest solution plan for the Indian issue, which included six points. The chairman was the establishment of the Indian Federation. The federal government has jurisdiction over foreign affairs, national defense, and transportation. Central administrative agencies and all-India conferences are established. Major bills must be passed by a majority of all members, and must be passed by a majority of each of the Congress Party and the Muslim League. Other powers of the government are granted to the provinces, allowing the provinces to organize their own administrative agencies and parliaments. Regarding the issue of constitution-making, each million people elects one representative, and the elected representatives are divided into three groups: Muslim, Sikh, and general. However, among the 292 seats in the All-India Constitutional Assembly, 210 seats should belong to general representatives. On this point of the constitutional assembly, the Hindus clearly have a great advantage. The reaction from the Indian side to this white paper is still a mess. The Congress Party is unwilling to participate in this temporary government with equal shares, but approves of the constitutional assembly in which it has a large advantage in proportion; the Muslim League is willing to participate in the temporary government, but opposes this constitutional assembly in which it has a minority. This last proposal then failed under such circumstances, and the British Cabinet delegation left India and returned home on June 29.</p>
<p>Unity Leads to Success, Division Leads to Failure</p>
<p>But in this new plan, there is one point that is quite thought-provoking, that is, it clearly opposes partition and supports unification. This is the first time in British history in India that it has not favored the Muslim League. In the past, Britain was always favoring the Muslim League to weaken the external forces of the Indian independence movement. This time, Britain is indeed determined to solve the problem. Roughly speaking, there are also many reasons for this, and the situation forces it to make such a decision. On the one hand, the tide of the Indian independence movement is surging, and everywhere is making the situation move towards a kind of fierce revolutionary edge, which can no longer be dealt with by the traditional "delay" policy. On the other hand, the activities of the Soviet Union in Iran and the situation in the northwest corner of Iran made Britain deeply fearful. When the Muslim League was arguing with the Congress Party over the "Pakistan" issue, a leader of the Muslim League once said, "I think the Soviet Union, our northern neighbor, will support our demands." In fact, many left-wing youths are also looking north. If the power of the Soviet Union invades the Persian Gulf through Iran, the situation in India, which bears the brunt, will be difficult to reverse. If there is a "Pakistan" as Jinnah requires in the northwest of the Indian border, then the complexity of the situation will naturally be more difficult to deal with. The British are very clear about all this. They see that continued rule is impossible, so today's peaceful withdrawal (especially to the more moderate members of the Congress Party) can still maintain some commercial and resource advantages, otherwise if the revolution breaks out that day, the withdrawal will be even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>The British are determined to solve the problem this time, but due to the conflict between the two parties within India, a very good opportunity for independence has been lightly let go. As Nehru said, "A half-free and half-enslaved world should no longer exist." The era is moving in the direction of independence and freedom, but the Indian people themselves should also understand that unless the internal strife ceases, the hope of independence and freedom will always be difficult to achieve. The goal of India today should be to unite in seeking the independence of their own country, and not to let internal disputes and historical hatred and suspicion weaken the strength of the independence movement. If a country wants to turn over from the oppression and bondage of another country, it must be unity leads to success, division leads to failure. We China wish to see an independent, free, strong, and peace-loving neighbor. The leaders of India should be able to make wise choices at the crossroads of this national destiny!</p>

<h3>Yang Wendao's Wrongful Imprisonment Seeks Redress - He Angrily Denounces Traitors in Court - The Vicious Jail Guard, "Number Eleven," is Difficult to Investigate - Yang Jianzhong and Tan Sheng Offer Evasive Testimony</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Yang Wendao (see previous image) was re-tried in the High Court's Criminal Division at 3:30 PM yesterday, presided over by Judge Wang Kequan. In addition to Yang Wendao, the important figures present included lawyer Tang Huaiqun, who has been working pro bono for Yang for ten years, lawyer Ge Zhaoji, who defended Yang ten years ago, and witnesses Yang Jianzhong and Tan Sheng, who were present at the original trial. Zeng Yuan, who once used the alias Cao Cao and planned to flee Shanghai, sat quietly in the audience and did not report to the court.</p>
<p>Judge Wang first informed lawyer Tang that detaining witnesses was not legally justified. If he wished to accuse these witnesses of perjury, he should file a separate complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. He then interrogated Yang Wendao. Yang, due to extreme nervousness, tried to suppress himself, but his demeanor was still not very natural. Yang stated that he was the person in charge of the Hong Shun, Tong Ren, and Tong Yi three "Mutual Aid Associations," all of which were charitable organizations established many years ago. Judge Wang immediately asked, "Are these associations assassination organizations?" Yang replied, "They are charitable organizations, registered with the competent authorities." Asked, "According to you, you didn't kill Nakayama Hideo?" Yang then generously stated, "I truly know absolutely nothing about Nakayama Hideo's matter. I have lived a clean life, and only now, when our nation has been restored, do I have the opportunity to speak out. At this point, Yang vehemently criticized Zeng Yuan, Yang Jianzhong, Zheng Huimin, Zhang Caiyuan, Tan Sheng, and others, saying, "Please pay attention, Your Honor, these people were traitors even before the Japanese came! These shameless people formed a group, willingly served the enemy, and constantly created incidents on the clean land of the Republic of China. Taking this case as an example, they knew that I was a member of the Hongmen and never lagged behind others in loving the country, so they made me a scapegoat first. Although my life and death are insignificant, they directly harmed me on the one hand and indirectly harmed China on the other!"</p>
<p>The judge then asked if he knew Korean Jeck. He replied no. Asked if he knew Ye Haisheng, he replied that Ye was a member of the Hongshun Association, but they did not associate closely. Asked if it was true that on October 15th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), someone went to the Tongyi Association to draw lots to see who would take action, and Ye drew the lot, he replied that it was completely untrue. Asked, "On the afternoon of November 9th of the 24th year of the Republic, did you, Ye Haisheng, and Jeck go to North Sichuan Road and take a handgun from a book with a hole in it and hand it to Ye Haisheng?" he replied "Absolutely not." Asked, "Upon reaching Baole'an Road, did you encounter Nakayama Hideo, and Ye followed him into Fengle Lane and killed Nakayama from the side?" he replied, "Absolutely not."</p>
<p>Yang stated that the Dimon brand pistol and its holster were borrowed from Li Mu, the secretary-general of the Public Security Bureau at the time, for self-defense. Because he had many children at home and feared accidents, he followed Yang Jianzhong's advice to hollow out a book and put the gun inside for safety. This book was in English, but the book shown by the court during the subsequent trial had been changed to a Chinese book.</p>
<p>Asked, "Did the police beat you?" He replied, "They beat me severely, from the investigative court until the death sentence was pronounced. Every midnight, they beat me until dawn. I knelt on the ground, and the Japanese police took off their leather shoes and beat me, repeatedly forcing me to confess that I had taken 150,000 yuan from Mayor Wu Tiecheng and was told to kill Nakayama Hideo, but I would rather die than comply. I died and came back to life several times before I realized that my left rib was broken." At this point, regarding the judge's request for Ye Haisheng to demonstrate what happened, lawyer Tang argued that this "demonstration" was being done while surrounded by hundreds of enemy marines and should more appropriately be called "directed" by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The court then summoned witness Yang Jianzhong. Yang, Yang Wendao's cousin, wore an old white silk western suit and yellow leather shoes, and looked quite dejected. The court asked if he could see the light, the court would not pursue his past actions. Yang Jianzhong then tried to push all responsibility onto his deceased cousin, Yang Guimei, and said that he himself only saw Yang Wendao once every month or two, and he had never been to Yang Wendao's house. The court then asked, "If you had nothing to do with this case, why did you try to escape after the incident?" He replied, "Because I saw the Da Mei Evening News reported that during the trial, Yang Wendao was asked 'Has Yang Jianzhong left?' Therefore, I had to leave."</p>
<p>Yang Wendao stated that Yang Guimei had falsely told him on April 15th of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) that the furniture of the Beishan Fellow Villagers Association had been moved away and told him to leave, but in reality, none of this was true. People with suspicious appearances were coming and going in front of Yang Wendao's door at that time.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 19th, at 10:00 AM, when Yang Wendao went out, he saw Tan Sheng, who beckoned plainclothes Japanese police officers who then dragged him into a car and took him directly to the Disweilu Police Station.</p>
<p>At this time, lawyer Tang suddenly stood up and claimed that Tan Sheng was now in court. Judge Wang then summoned him, and this "witness" wearing tattered Xiangyun yarn clothes and bare feet in slippers appeared before the entire audience.</p>
<p>Tan Sheng stated that he had known Yang Wendao for a long time, and Yang was his "Big Brother." He himself had a food stall at Fudan University in Jiangwan, and every day at 9:00 AM, he would go to Li Pu's house in Desheng Lane to smoke opium. There was a "Dongyang Zheng" (Japanese Zheng) who inquired about Yang Wendao's whereabouts. A Wang who was also smoking there said, "Tan Laosheng knows him." An hour later, the Japanese came again to inquire, and all four people in the opium den were taken to the Disweilu Police Station. That afternoon, they were interrogated and told that if they didn't speak, they would be beaten. So, he led them to Yang Wendao's house.</p>
<p>The judge asked Yang Wendao if he had anything to say to the witness. Yang, extremely angry, cursed Tan Sheng, saying, "I only want to say that these people are harmful traitors!" Tan Sheng, in a panic, replied loudly, "I was oppressed by the Japanese and had no choice!"</p>
<p>At this time, lawyer Tang presented a petition from Major General Zhang Lipu, requesting redress for the tragic death of his brother Zhang Chen. The court, because it was related to reporting traitors, instructed it to be sent to the High Prosecutor's Office. Yang Wendao also mentioned that when he was imprisoned in the Western Prison in the past, there was a guard numbered eleven who would beat him severely every time he saw him, and he requested an investigation. The judge replied that it was impossible to investigate and instructed him to provide additional favorable evidence to continue the investigation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the trial of this case, Yang Wendao answered in Cantonese, and lawyer Ge Zhaoji, who defended Yang in the past, translated for him into Mandarin. Because lawyer Tang had already submitted a petition to redress Zhang Chen's grievances, Ge wanted to speak as a witness. The court ruled that since he was serving as an interpreter, it was inappropriate for him to testify and did not allow it. However, because lawyer Ge had handled this case in the past and had been threatened by the Japanese, who gave him 24 hours to leave Shanghai, and was later forced to flee, he still spoke eloquently, saying that Zhang Chen, out of a sense of conscience, proved Yang Wendao's innocence and was ultimately killed by Zeng Yuan. His emotions were agitated, and he turned around and pointed at Zeng Yuan in the audience, shouting, "Traitor!" The whole audience was shocked. However, this "witness" who called himself "Cao Cao" and planned to flee to Hong Kong, although also present, was not summoned by the court because he had not reported to the court. Therefore, this suspected traitor who had been reported was still able to walk out of the courthouse safely as a witness.</p>

<h3>Sullivan Labor-Management Dispute - Request to the Social Affairs Bureau for Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sullivan Confectionery Company on Nanjing Road suspended business from noon on the 15th due to a labor-management dispute. More than 20 employees sat idly in the store, waiting for a resolution. It is understood that since July 8th, Yu Xingen contracted with the Sullivan Confectionery and Bakery to resume operations. At that time, the employees, who had all served for more than ten years, demanded to be paid according to pre-war standards, but the seller consistently used the excuse of no certainty about business to repeatedly delay, resulting in a stalemate. The matter has now been reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.</p>
<h3>Two Dance Halls Defy Orders - Still Have "Managers"</h3>

<h3>Yang Xizhi Appeared in Court Yesterday for Questioning - Unwilling to Say Much About the Grain Loan Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yang Xizhi, former Shanghai Grain Affairs Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Food, appeared at the office on Xuehuali Road at 9:40 AM yesterday in response to a summons for the District Prosecutor's Office's investigation into the grain loan corruption case. At 10:10 AM, Prosecutor Wu Qihua took the seat in the seventh court to inquire about the details of Yang's grain loan experience. The interrogation was completed at 10:55 AM, and Yang left in his car at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Yang Xizhi wore a light brown American gabardine suit, a white shirt with a floral tie, brown leather shoes, and a white cork hat. He arrived in a blue-gray National Shanghai 12119 car with Zhu Yingzhi, the secretary of lawyer Duanmu Kai, and a friend surnamed Tang. After getting out of the car, Yang immediately took his summons and went to the registration office to complete the registration procedures. His summons number was 2443, and the address listed was No. 26, Lane 622, Linsen Middle Road.</p>
<p>Regarding his absence from the first summons for questioning by the District Prosecutor's Office at 9:00 AM on the 7th of this month, he explained to reporters that the Ministry of Food called me at 12:00 PM on the 7th, and I didn't have time to go. The formal summons was only received on the morning of the 8th, so it was not that I resisted the summons.</p>
<p>Regarding this grain loan corruption case, Yang said: I respect the national law and respect the investigation. I have always been a public servant who abides by the law. When I went to the United States on March 14th, the grain loan method had not yet been approved, and whether to implement it was still being decided. After arriving in the United States, I was very isolated from domestic news. Later, I suddenly received a telegram from the Ministry of Food stating that the District Court wanted to summon me for questioning regarding grain loan corruption. I was very surprised to receive this news and hurriedly returned to China to find out about this matter. Now that the case is still under investigation, I do not want to say much, please forgive me.</p>

<h3>The Original Plaintiff, Zeng Yuan, Was Again Accused of Being a Traitor - Secretly Reported to the Enemy Gendarmes Who Killed Zhang Chen, an Important Witness in the Yang Case - The Victim's Brother Came to Shanghai to Seek Redress</h3>
<p>Before the trial began, lawyer Tang excitedly told reporters: "This case is probably the biggest case outside of the traitor cases since the victory, right?"</p>
<p>He said that early yesterday morning, a Major General Zhang Lipu suddenly came from Nanjing to find him. This General Zhang is a graduate of the fourth class of Whampoa Military Academy, but his younger brother is Zhang Chen, one of the important witnesses in the Yang Wendao case! According to this General Zhang, Zhang Chen was wronged because he testified for Yang Wendao, and was resented by Zeng Yuan, who reported Yang Wendao. After the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, Zhang Chen had served as a major quartermaster in the General Headquarters of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army of the Military Commission, and in the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he was the major intelligence group leader of the Shanghai Action Team directly under the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He did not expect that although he knew Zeng Yuan had a grudge against him, he was very close to Zeng Yuan's younger aunt Yao Jianying. As a result, Zeng Yuan reported him to the Japanese army, and Zhang Chen was executed.</p>
<p>General Zhang Lipu has already filed a complaint accusing Zeng Yuan of treason. During the trial yesterday, lawyer Tang presented the complaint in court. Zeng Yuan was sitting in the audience, and when he saw this unexpected stroke by lawyer Tang, he immediately trembled, and his face turned pale. An old straw hat on his lap almost fell to the ground!</p>
<p>How did Zhang Chen die? Lawyer Ge Zhaoji said that the Japanese put him in a pot of boiling water and burned him alive.</p>

<h3>Warehouse Gauze Piled Up Like Mountains - All Belongs to the People's Wealth and Should Be Dealt With Quickly - The Investigation Team Pays Close Attention to Two Fires</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Receiving and Investigation Team's inspection of enemy and puppet warehouses began yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Committee Member Wu Wangji and Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen of the team, accompanied by Zhang Xi, the group leader of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong, the customs commissioners of the Jianghai Customs, departed and inspected more than 20 locations, including the Broadway Road Gonghexing Wharf Warehouse, the Yangshupu Pu Wharf Warehouse, the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf Warehouse, and the Jiangwan Qimei Road Japanese Army Stable Warehouse. The inspection situation of each warehouse is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Gonghexing Wharf Warehouse originally had 32 warehouses, all storing enemy and puppet materials. 31 of them have now been returned to their owners. Only one warehouse still stores military supplies such as steel helmets, minesweeping shells, canvas tents, explosives, old guns, and ink. (2) The China Merchants Bureau North Wharf Warehouse originally had 26 warehouses, 24 and a half of which have now been vacated. One and a half still store military supplies such as military uniforms, military shoes, artillery shells, bullets, etc., but all are small and scattered. (3) The Shanghai Warehouse originally had 14 warehouses, and about half of them still contain enemy and puppet materials, all of which are gauze, newspapers, soap, rayon, bicycles, etc. Among them, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are piled up like mountains, and the value is very considerable. (4) The Huangpu Wharf Warehouse only contained residual Japanese military supplies and items such as knives and shovels for military use. Most of them have been emptied. (5) The Gonghexing K-shaped Warehouse and the Qimei Road Stable Warehouse were burned in February and September of this year, respectively. The former damaged many of the Head Office's machines, and the latter stored food, causing millions of bags of corn to be destroyed. The investigation team is currently inquiring with the handling bureau about the truth of the two fires and the handling of the aftermath. Committee Members Wu and Zhang told reporters after the inspection: Although the enemy and puppet materials currently stored in the warehouses are only a small part, the number is still considerable. This kind of material is actually the wealth of our people. Whether it is returned or sold, it should be dealt with quickly. They also said that all the warehouses have been reorganized by the Jianghai Customs after receiving them, and now have clear registers for inspection, and the management is more strict than before. According to the Jianghai Customs, if the military supplies currently stored in each warehouse can be removed by the relevant authorities immediately, all of them can be cleared by the end of next month, for commercial use and for the Head Office to use. However, after the victory, most of the enemy and puppet materials were transferred and handed over for receiving, and it is inevitable that there will be mess and omissions. The investigation team also attaches great importance to the two warehouses that caught fire. However, according to the handling bureau, the Gonghexing K-shaped Warehouse had fire insurance of 30 million yuan with the Central Trust Bureau, and was compensated in full after the fire. The scrap iron that was burned was also sold for more than 20 million yuan, so the warehouse received a total of more than 50 million yuan after the accident and did not suffer a loss. Other warehouses will continue to be inspected tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Military Judge Conducts Trial of Four Criminals in a Case of Stealing and Selling Received Materials</h3>

<h3>Swiss Enemy Collaborator Admits to Selling Purple Copper</h3>
<p>Forged US Dollar Portion Under Interrogation</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Swiss man, Weidelai, a key enemy collaborator suspected of manufacturing counterfeit US dollars, has been under interrogation since being arrested by the Garrison Headquarters. It is understood that the suspect has admitted to selling purple copper to the Japanese Kenpeitai (military police). This purple copper was purchased from a certain American firm at a cost of 400,000 yuan. As for the collaboration with the Japanese side, the suspect has also admitted it, but claimed that his purpose was to obtain certain conveniences for himself as an American, and even claimed that he was employed by the US Treasury Department, hence he had the tacit consent of the US side. However, after a lengthy investigation by the investigative team, the US side has denied this point, as his name was not found on the payroll at the time. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Garrison Headquarters stated that there is sufficient evidence regarding the suspect's collusion with the enemy to establish the charges. The case will be transferred to the court for handling after the interrogation of the counterfeit money portion is completed.</p>

<h3>US Pilot's Execution Case: Trial Did Not Comply with Legal Procedures; US Prosecutor Accuses Tanaka Hisaichi of Being Responsible</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The US Military Tribunal continued to hear the case of Major Hocker being killed by the Japanese army in Hong Kong yesterday morning. Witness Sergeant Kawashima was the clerk of the Japanese military court that tried Hocker at the time. The points testified yesterday were largely the same as those stated by the first witness, Nakazawa Asao, the day before, that is, no witnesses or material evidence were provided at the trial on that day, only three reports from the military police and the prosecutor were relied upon. Hocker himself stated that the bombing target was a destroyer, and if fishing boats were affected as a result, it was not intentional. Based on the testimony of these two people, it is extremely clear that the Japanese military court's sentencing of Hocker to death at the time did not comply with legal procedures. Yesterday, the chief prosecutor also presented a document containing the statement made by the former chief military judge of the Japanese 23rd Army in Guangzhou last December when questioned by the US Strategic Services regarding the Japanese military court's trial procedures. It was claimed that cases sentenced to death by the 23rd Army Court did not need to be approved by the Tokyo Army Department, only the signature of the commander was required to execute the sentence. Based on this point, the prosecutor accused Lieutenant General Tanaka Hisaichi, who was the commander of the 23rd Army at the time, of being responsible for the illegal sentencing of Major Hocker to death.</p>
<h3>Seeking a Son, Getting a Son, and Ultimately Losing a Son: A Bizarre History of Love Between Master and Servant</h3>
<p>[Our Report] You Shiliang, a native of Wuxi, is 35 years old and resides at No. 50, Lane 630, Datong Road. He is currently an accountant at a certain oil factory in this city, with modest savings. His wife, Mrs. Mao, has a very deep affection for him. They have already had five daughters, but the only shortcoming is that they do not have a son. In April of last year, he hired a maid, Wang Axiang (29 years old), a native of Shaoxing, with bright eyes and white teeth, quite attractive. As a result, You and the servant had an illicit affair. Before long, Wang became pregnant, and her abdomen swelled. You then sent the woman to his rural hometown in Wuxi to give birth. On May 13th of this year, she gave birth to a son. You was overjoyed and brought her to Shanghai. He informed his wife of the details, and finally obtained his wife's permission and formally cohabited after holding a grand banquet. Unexpectedly, Wang Axiang had a husband, Chen Qingsen, who lived in her original place of residence. Until recently, her husband Chen Qingsen, due to his wife's long absence, made arrangements to come to Shanghai and went straight to her aunt's house at No. 36 Ruiling Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, to inquire. Only then did he learn that his wife was cohabiting with You and raising a child. Chen, considering it a family scandal and not wanting to make it public, simply took his wife and child away. Unexpectedly, You Shiliang, upon seeing his beloved son disappear, falsely reported a kidnapping to the Xincheng Police Station, and accused Chen of kidnapping for ransom. Thereupon, the bureau ordered officers to detain Wang Axiang and her husband for investigation. After investigation, the whole story was revealed. Because Chen Qingsen was unwilling to pursue the past, Director Zhuo of the bureau reprimanded You and released him. However, You, being anxious about his son, was still reluctant to leave.</p>
<h3>Liling Road Robbery Case Cracked</h3>

<h3>Manager and Director Accuse Each Other of Privately Withdrawing Goods for Sale</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Huahua Cigarette Factory on Changde Road has an office at No. 304 Hartung Building, Nanjing Road. Manager Zheng Peixiang ordered 14 boxes of tin foil for wrapping cigarettes from the Hualu Aluminum Steel Factory in Hongkou in April of this year, worth approximately ten million yuan. However, this procedure was entrusted to Shen Wenqing, the factory's business department director and salesperson. Unexpectedly, Shen took advantage of his position and privately engraved a seal on May 12th and June 18th of this year, using a false name to withdraw the goods from the Hualu Factory, and then sold the goods separately for his own use. Zheng Peixiang learned of this matter and reported it to the Huangpu Branch last month, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, Zhou Guanghui, the criminal section chief, ordered his subordinates to rush to arrest Shen, but he was not found. At the same time, Shen Wenqing filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, accusing Zheng Peixiang of obstructing freedom. The District Procuratorate then opened a court session yesterday morning to summon the plaintiff and defendant to court for interrogation. As a result, each was ordered to be released on bail pending further investigation. However, when the Huangpu Branch learned of this, it immediately ordered Wang Zhicheng, a section member, and others to secretly wait at the intersection of Fanhangdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. When Shen Wenqing returned home for lunch after leaving the court, they arrested him and took him to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

Among the less popular stocks, except for Xinya which was more sluggish, the rest all rose from low to high. Huacheng Tobacco, under the capital increase period of one-to-ten, stopped trading. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn fell by 18 yuan, and Meiya fell by another half. Jingfu rose slightly, and Xinguang and Qinxing each rose by more than half. Among the less popular small and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks, only Xinya fell slightly, and the rest were relatively stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to rise after falling. A certain foreign firm strongly purchased Yi Yarn. In addition, there were rumors that Asia was issuing dividends of 2 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong, and buying sentiment was very strong. Both stocks were the most prominent. Yi Yarn opened at 8,500 yuan in the morning. Affected by Chinese stocks, the low price once retreated to 8,010 yuan. A certain foreign firm bought in, and the Asian news had positive news. Both spurred a surge, and Yi Yarn rose to 9,700 yuan. British United rose from 8,400 yuan to 9,600 yuan. Asia rose to 1,300 yuan before stabilizing slightly. Compared to the previous close, Asia alone rose by 15%, and Yi Yarn and British United rose by a little over 10%. Yeguang Paper rose slightly, and the rest had minor rises and falls.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Preparing to Form a Company</h3>
<p>Insurance Companies' Application to Become Brokers Denied</p>
<p>The preparatory work for the Securities Exchange has entered its final stage. The brokers have been reviewed and the list of qualified individuals will be sent to the Ministry for approval today. The listed securities are also being reviewed separately. The preparatory committee is now starting another task, namely the organization of the Securities Exchange Co., Ltd. The promoters' meeting will be convened within the next week. In addition, among the brokers who applied this time, only 15 are foreign merchants, all of whom have been fully reviewed and qualified. The Ministry of Finance has denied the request of insurance companies to act as brokers because it does not comply with the law.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Firm; Oil Prices Rebound Slightly; City Orders Submission and Handling of Unsold Coarse Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 4,700-odd shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets, mostly medium and lower quality. High prices remained popular while less desirable rice remained stagnant. There was a shortage of white yuan rice, which continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. The new japonica rice was in a stable situation. As for the allocation of coarse rice sold at rice shops, due to the scarcity of buyers, they requested to return the rice or sell it milled white. The trade association has repeatedly submitted this matter to the municipal government for instructions. The directors and supervisors of the association personally visited the mayor at the municipal government the day before yesterday to explain everything in detail. It was ordered that the trade association notify all rice shops to report the exact quantity of coarse rice sold and stored within three days for submission and handling. It is said that the association has notified its members to fill out the report within three days. Zero sales of flour are still active. There was not much imported flour yesterday, but the supply of miscellaneous brands of flour was still connected, forming a temporary stable situation, with a slight increase of 100 yuan. The bran stations are stagnant. The wheat from Shantou and Xiamen did not have strong demand, and the Yongfang area selectively accepted it. Sales by the northern gangs turned slack. The oil market saw a surge of goods from Qingdao, and raw oil rebounded by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil was flat, and refined vegetable oil was stable. The source of yellow beans from Henan province was becoming scarce. They had not arrived from Jiujiang, but they had arrived from Hankou and Changzhou, and the price rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are being handled by the Guang area, and continued to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame is currently in the transition period between new and old, and there are many changes, making it difficult to grasp for the time being.</p>
<h3>Both Food Oil Arrivals and Storage Increase; Zhongzhi Oil Factory Adds New Vehicles</h3>
<p>Zhongzhi Oil Factory distributed a large amount of raw sesame oil yesterday at 72,000 yuan, calculated based on the 羝到arrival price. The company has installed a new 5-ton truck, and is also installing a 10-ton truck and a 5-ton truck. Soon, the daily output can be increased by more than 100 dan. In addition, the Haiji wheel departed from Qingdao a few days ago with 1,000 dan. It is reported that Zhongshi Company has 8,700-odd dan of raw oil stored in the Huangpu warehouse.</p>
<h3>Mexico Has Surplus Cotton for Sale to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Mexico City, 16th] This year's Mexican cotton harvest is estimated to reach approximately 430,000 bales. Most of the cotton surplus from last year and this year has been shipped to China, and a small portion has been shipped to Canada and Spain. The total export volume for 1946-47 is expected to exceed 60,000 to 70,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Qihong Asks for Too High a Price; Difficult to Negotiate Deals</h3>
<p>The new Qimen black tea this year, although shipped to Shanghai by Zhenhe Tea Co. and others, has very high prices due to the large cost of production and all kinds of fees, reaching as high as 600,000 yuan per dan. According to news from export merchants, there has been a great demand from Europe and the United States recently, but due to the high price, they dare not inquire. Currently, Zhuyu Tea Co. and XXX Tea Co. are still inspecting the tea. However, if the sellers can make concessions, the winner can try to sell it overseas. In addition, foreign firms are still very interested in medium-grade Chen Chen Chou Zhen and Dong Zhen Mei teas, which are well-made and have no moldy taste in the tea liquor or leaf bottoms. At the same time, Indian merchants have been constantly 吸扒 absorbing Taiwan fine red vegetable tea, and there have also been transactions, and the market is rising again. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, they have not decreased.</p>
<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Talks About Subsidies for Raw Silk; Tea, Tung Oil, etc., Also Planned to Follow Suit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 17th] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yun-wu, after arriving in Kuling on the 16th, told reporters that in order to encourage exports, the government has already begun implementing a subsidy policy for raw silk. Exports of other commodities, such as tea and tung oil, are also planned to be subsidized in succession. This subsidy policy is intended to support export trade by the government. It is still hoped that industrial enterprises will reduce costs and increase production on their own, to avoid the government bearing huge long-term losses. The Minister stated that the industrial and commercial sectors are requesting government assistance for the economic crisis, and the government should accept this. However, the industrial and commercial sectors should also help themselves. He, coming from the private sector, cited Shanghai as an example: the city's fiscal revenue is about 4 billion per month, of which banquet taxes account for 1.5 billion. Calculating banquet taxes at 20%, Shanghai spends as much as 7.5 billion per month on banquets. This huge consumption, while not entirely from the industrial and commercial sectors, should at least account for a considerable amount. If the industrial and commercial sectors could economize mutually, using the funds spent on banquets to develop industrial and commercial enterprises, wouldn't that be better than seeking assistance? Finally, when reporters inquired about the Minister's mission in Kuling, he replied that he was summoned to the mountains and could only announce it after meeting with the Chairman.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Production This Year Expected to Reach 5 Million Dan</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Farmers Bank of China, noting the good production conditions in cotton-producing provinces such as Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu this year, and with the cotton harvest season approaching, have exchanged views with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and various yarn factories on acquisition. The goal is to plan acquisition methods, so that a combined force can be used for cooperation when the time comes. Shaanxi cotton production this year is expected to reach 1.2 million dan, and national production is expected to reach 5 million dan.</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau's Inefficient Handling; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Request for Improvement; Pre-War Tax Bills Issued Same Day; Now Must Wait Up to a Week</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to request that the Goods Tax Bureau restore the practice of issuing cotton yarn tax bills on the same day, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating roughly: According to a letter from the Municipal Towel and Blanket Industry Association: In order to export directly woven finished cotton yarn products, it is necessary to send the original cotton yarn ex-factory tax bills to the Goods Tax Bureau for issuing shipping permits before export. This permit procedure could be completed on the same day before the war, but now it is officially stipulated as three days, and in practice it often takes up to a week or even longer. Recently, the number of ships to other ports has decreased, and the shipping schedules are far apart. The delay in issuing permits often leads to delays in shipping, making it difficult to export goods. This puts a greater strain on the circulation of funds. Please forward this to the Ministry of Finance, instructing the Goods Tax Bureau to restore the pre-war practice of issuing permits on the same day, to facilitate industry and commerce. It was easy for industrial and commercial enterprises to complete tax paperwork on the same day before the war. The Bureau was re-established after the war and has been operating for nearly a year; it is assumed that its internal structure has gradually been organized completely. All the good practices that benefited merchants and the public before the war should be restored as quickly as possible, in order to eliminate any gap between officials and merchants. Facilitating the circulation of goods also benefits national tax revenue. We respectfully request that your ministry instruct the Bureau to make proper and quick arrangements.</p>
<h3>Smooth Cargo Transportation on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Peh Steam Navigation Company, and China National Aviation Corporation all have ships going up and down the river. China National Aviation Corporation's "Minlian" ship has sailed from Shanghai to Chongqing, loaded with a large quantity of hardware and paints, as well as more than 600 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The "Minzhong" arrived in Shanghai today from Yichang, but the incoming cargo is unknown. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangshun" ship also sailed to Chongqing this morning, fully loaded with 1,600 tons of mixed goods, including more than 500 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. San Peh Steam Navigation Company's "Hongzhen" ship is scheduled to sail to Hankou next Tuesday, and its tonnage is already fully booked.</p>
<h3>Yarn Rises, Cloth Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was firm. Sporadic transactions between the Tianjin and Guangzhou guilds were not quiet. 20-count yarn generally rose by about 20,000, with the old brand 20-count yarn from Fangjian being the most popular. Due to the fact that Fangjian only offered cone yarn for sale for 42-count double-strand thread the previous day, all of the competitors were turned away empty-handed, which led to an increase of 40,000 to 50,000 for thread yesterday, as there were many people searching for it.</p>
<p>The cloth market was bleak and lifeless. Sales were sluggish, and at the same time, many speculators were dumping their holdings. The prices of Caiqiu Yanghe serge continued to weaken. The price of other fabrics was generally unchanged, and there were very few transactions. Fangjian Company opened sales as usual, with serge priced at 1,250 yuan for "small" and V Longtou at 1,000 yuan for "small."</p>
<h3>White Coal Blocks Surge</h3>
<p>After coal merchants watched over and made purchases in the coal market, the supply of spot goods on the market has been extremely scarce in recent days. Therefore, traders who need to purchase coal can only raise prices to compete for purchases. Prices have risen sharply across the board. Because of shortages, small pieces of white coal are also selling well in coal stores, and prices are rising along with the lump coal. The main sales channel for large white coal pieces is for manufacturing coal balls. Recently, due to the strong sales of liquid fuels such as coal oil, the sales channels of coal balls have been greatly affected, so the prices remain stable.</p>
<h3>Price Index Life Insurance; Central Trust Bureau Clarifies Meaning; Charges 2/1000 of Insured Amount; Letter of Reply Takes Effect Immediately, Forms Supplement Later</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Life Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau has launched group life insurance based on the price index to protect the livelihood of the people. In order to make all sectors understand the function of this group life insurance, the Bureau hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday. The manager of the Bureau, Luo Beichen, first stated the importance of life insurance, and then made several points regarding the special price index group life insurance plan: (1) Motivation: (A) For the outside world, it is purely to protect the livelihood of the people. (B) For the Bureau itself, it is to open up new life insurance business. (2) Principle: To obtain the maximum benefit with the minimum cost. The goal is for this life insurance plan to conform to economic principles. (3) Design Process: The Bureau had previously considered life insurance plans based on rice, wheat, gold, U.S. dollars, and foreign exchange rates, but they were not successful. Finally, it created the price index life insurance plan. (4) Features: (A) The cost of living index unit is used as the insurance unit, and the insured amount of the insured person can automatically increase or decrease with the rise and fall of the cost of living index. (B) No distinction is made between genders. (C) No distinction is made between occupations. (D) No distinction is made between physical strength. (5) Procedures are extremely simple. Any agency or organization that wishes to insure only needs to send a letter to the Bureau. It will take effect immediately after the Bureau sends a letter of approval. The forms are to be completed later. The insurance premium is uniformly calculated at 2/1000 of the insured amount and is collected monthly. (6) The insured amount of the insured person can be as high as ten "cost of living index units," or five million yuan. It can be changed monthly to meet needs. If the insured person unfortunately dies or becomes disabled, compensation will be paid immediately in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Flour Export; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Telegram Request</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a request from the Tianjin Grain Merchants Association to lift the ban on shipping Shanghai flour to Tianjin, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food again yesterday, requesting that the ban on flour exports be lifted. The original telegram stated roughly: (omitted above) According to the current situation, Shanghai flour mills have a surplus of more than 100,000 bags per day. Tianjin also needs to transport southern flour north. Lifting the ban would benefit both sides, while maintaining the original order would hinder both the Shanghai flour mills and the Tianjin people's food supply, which is very clear. Even for the sake of the Shanghai people's food supply, it should be judged whether the flour production and the local sales volume in Shanghai are balanced. Now that there is a surplus production of more than 100,000 bags per day, it is clear evidence that there is a surplus for the people's food supply. It is requested that your esteemed departments adopt the suggestions of the industrial and commercial sectors in Beijing and Shanghai and approve the export of flour, which is in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Central Sand White Coal Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the central sand white coal rise again, as the company's allocation of raw sugar to the trade had an expectation of supplying 30,000 bags, but the result was that only 14,100 bags were actually allocated at 47%, so it has recovered to its original price. It is evident that the amount of supply is greatly related to the increase or decrease in price. Other local high-quality sugar is also in tight supply, while lower-quality sugar is flat. Chaoqing sugar saw continuous purchases from the Ningbo group, and the top grade opened at 100,000, and the secondary grade at 98,500 to 95,500 yuan, totaling over one hundred bags. Cotton sugar of fifty to sixty bags sold for 125,000 to 126,000 yuan, Xinghua white sugar for 141,500 to 142,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar for 117,000 to 118,000 yuan, with over one hundred transactions, and oil-packaged miscellaneous Qing sugar for 90,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Timber Dull and Weak</h3>
<p>The timber market is dull and weak. There are now more imported foreign pine, so the market price has fallen. However, due to the large expenses such as warehousing and loading costs, the price will not plummet drastically. Now, a large amount of ship-side delivery is being dumped on the market, which is cheaper than the market price.</p>
<p>Shanghai Import and Export Statistics for the First Half of the Year</p>
<p>According to statistics released by the Customs, the total value of Shanghai's imports and exports for June of this year is as follows (unit: 1,000 yuan):</p>

<h3>Today's Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>— Xi'an, 3rd (Air Mail) Special Correspondent Li Chi</p>
<p>The entire line's track restoration project has been completed. The Tianbao section is awaiting opening. Work has commenced on the Tianlan section. Direct through train service between Beijing and Shaanxi is being planned.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway is China's only railway running east-west, starting from Tianshui in Gansu in the west and ending at Haizhou in Jiangsu in the east, connecting the Northwest Plateau and the coastal area of the Huai River. The Longhai Railway Bureau—the headquarters of this railway—is still in Xi'an. Because the location is too far west, it will soon be moved to Zhengzhou, which is closer to the midpoint of the entire line. During the reconstruction period, the Longhai Railway is playing a huge role in transportation. The train cars passing through Xi'an, whether heading east or west, are equally crowded with passengers and cargo. Those who cannot get in are squeezed onto the top of the cars.</p>
<p>Landslides Expected to Decrease</p>
<p>We should start with the west, with the section from Tianshui to Baoji. Construction began during the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War and was only opened to traffic this spring. Because the work was rushed and materials were insufficient, the construction was sloppy and far from meeting engineering standards. In particular, the slope of the mountains was insufficient, so landslides were frequent. Landslides of thousands of cubic meters of loess were "commonplace," and even collapses of tens of thousands of "cubic meters" were not uncommon. Therefore, although the tracks were painstakingly laid, the number of days of traffic in the past few months was clearly much less than the number of days without traffic. In fact, as early as shortly after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War last fall, some "insiders" in railway transportation criticized the authorities for the upside-down priorities, because the section between Luoyang and Tongguan was delayed due to a lack of manpower and materials, while the "Tianbao section" at the west end was being rushed. They predicted the results caused by "landslides" and therefore advocated stopping the construction of the "Tianbao section," moving the materials from that area eastward, and quickly repairing the "Tongluo section" to meet the urgent needs of reconstruction. Now that the "Tianbao" and "Tongluo" sections have been completed one after another, the traffic results prove that if this suggestion had been implemented, many losses could have been reduced.</p>
<p>At 27 kilometers from Tianbao and at the 27th tunnel, there have recently been collapses of huge amounts of earthwork, each exceeding 10,000 "cubic meters." There are also many sporadic landslides along the way. The train has stopped. According to the Railway Bureau, it is expected that all of the landslides will be cleared by mid-August, but if it rains, there may be further delays. Fortunately, rainfall will gradually decrease after September, and landslides are expected to be less frequent in the future. The roadbed earthwork project between Lanzhou and Tianshui has begun. If the Tianbao section can be unimpeded, it will help the progress of the Tianlan section project.</p>
<p>Overview of the Xiantong Branch Line</p>
<p>Baoji is the junction point of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway and the Longhai Railway. For more than half a year, countless Chongqing passengers who could not get seats on Yangtze River ships have transferred to trains in Baoji to return east. The journey is as crowded as it was ten years ago when they fled west.</p>
<p>Xi'an County's western neighbor is Xianyang County. In Xianyang, the Longhai Railway has a "Xiantong Branch Line" that goes directly to Tongguan County, about 200 li north of Chang'an. This is a new railway built during the Anti-Japanese War, mainly used to transport coal from the Tongguan coal mines, for the railway itself and for civilian use along the line. Tongguan has more than 50 coal mines, seven of which have mechanical mining equipment, with a total monthly production of about 50,000 tons. However, the total amount transported by train, animal power, and human labor is only about 20,000 to 30,000 tons per month. At the beginning of the month, a railway bridge on the branch line was damaged by a mountain flood, but it was repaired a month ago. Only then did the Xi'an power plant resume normal power supply. Before that, there had been a power outage for more than 20 days. The coal price in the city has also gradually fallen, but it is still around 145,000 yuan per ton, while it is only sold for 37,000 to 38,000 yuan at the mines. The Railway Bureau is currently expanding a tunnel in the middle of the branch line, so that large locomotives can enter and exit. In this way, the transportation volume will be greatly increased, which will greatly benefit the mines and civilian use along the line. The construction of this tunnel has been going on for two years, and it has only recently been opened. It is known that the project is quite large. By the way, I recently saw several newly published Chinese maps of Shanghai, all of which omitted this branch line. Some even considered the "Tianbao section" as an uncompleted railway. Such errors seem unforgivable.</p>
<p>Directly to Luoyang on the Entire Line</p>
<p>The railway then goes east to Tongguan, where Shaanxi and Henan meet. It suffered through a darkest period during the Anti-Japanese War. The Longhai Railway has to pass through a tunnel there, the so-called 17th tunnel, before the eastward-bound train can enter the "pass" to Tongguan County. During the most critical times, the train could only run at night, with the lights turned off and the windows closed, crawling on the dark roadbed. Across the Yellow River from Tongguan is Fenglingdu, where there are still remains of the artillery positions built by the enemy. In those years, the enemy artillery crazily fired from there, aiming at Tongguan. If a shell hit the tunnel entrance, it could cut off the critical military transport and general transport at the time, reducing the contributions made by the Longhai Railway during the Anti-Japanese War. Fortunately, until the end of the war, the 17th tunnel only suffered severe vibrations from the bursting of shells, and cracks appeared in the tunnel walls, but the train could still pass. However, from the perspective of engineering calculations, it was dangerous.</p>
<p>After the victory last fall, the Longhai Railway Bureau repaired eastward from Tongguan. Repairing the 17th tunnel was also included in the plan. Later, because the track restoration project was tight, and if the tunnel was thoroughly repaired immediately, it would inevitably affect the eastward transport of road construction equipment. It was not until recently, when the entire line had reached Luoyang, that the old matter was brought up again, saying that construction would begin.</p>
<p>Surveying Three Routes</p>
<p>The problem then arose: To repair the tunnel, it is necessary to build another temporary detour road outside the old tunnel to replace the section of track being repaired inside the tunnel. The Longhai Railway Bureau surveyed three routes, two of which had to pass through the town of Tongguan, and one had to bypass the north city wall from outside the west gate and connect to the east station. These three routes all passed through many civilian houses, and it was necessary to demolish them to make way for the detour. Tongguan, a small town, had benefited greatly from the Longhai Railway in the past. The railway had brought wartime prosperity to it. However, the residents of the county town heard the news of the railway rerouting and had already begun to oppose it last year. Although the Railway Bureau had telegraphed the Ministry of Transport to purchase the land occupied by the detour, dividing it into three grades, A, B, and C, according to the highest land price, and the price offered was very high, the county residents still opposed it, saying, "If a detour is built in the city again, the central area of Tongguan will be destroyed. The people of Tongguan County and Town will definitely fight to the end and will never covet the high price." Since they admitted the "high price" but were still not convinced, the situation must be extremely helpless. The residents designed another route, passing through the west and outside the north city wall to Dongguan, which was only about 100 meters longer than the third route mentioned above.</p>
<p>Planning for Through Train Service on the Entire Line</p>
<p>The section from Tongguan to Lingbao Town was the first to be repaired after being damaged during the war, followed by the extension to Shaan County. Between Shaan County and Luoyang, repairs were carried out separately from the east and west ends, borrowing steel rails from other routes. It took a lot of hard work to complete the section at the beginning of last month. The borrowed steel rails were said to be of more than 50 different types, with different weights and lengths. The losses caused by the inability to standardize industrial equipment should be a profound lesson. Between Guanyintang and Xiashi Station on the Shaanluo section, there is a large bridge (Bridge No. 8), and the repair work was extremely difficult. After more than three months of hard work by more than 500 workers, requisitioning all the large timber along the line and the foreign pine timber supplied by UNRRA, it was completed at the end of July. It will be formally tested in the coming days, and if it is good, it will be officially opened to traffic. I'm afraid it won't be more than a few days. This is the last scene of the entire line restoration project of the Longhai Railway. Is it fast? It will soon be the first anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>After Bridge No. 8 is opened to traffic, Shaanxi and Luoyang can be directly connected, without having to change trains halfway like now. The traffic situation between Luoyang and Zhengzhou is still good. There are two routes between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, one is to bypass Xinxiang and cross the Yellow River via a temporary bridge between Xinxiang and Kaifeng; the other is to pass directly through the Zhongmou flood area between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Last month, due to the rising Yellow River water, the Xinbian temporary bridge was once interrupted; the Zhongmou railway bridge was also automatically dismantled due to the Yellow River water. It was not until late July that these two routes were restored, but they had to be connected by ferries. The details are beyond the scope of the reporter's report, so I will omit them here.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to report to the readers in Beijing and Shanghai: The Longhai Railway Bureau is planning through train service on the entire line, abolishing the current sectional train system (now a passenger traveling from Tianshui to Haizhou has to buy seven tickets and change trains six times!). It also plans to connect with the southern section of the Jinpu Railway to form a direct train between Beijing and Shaanxi. This may be realized after the Yellow River water recedes and the Zhongmou railway bridge is repaired again after autumn. This is a very beneficial plan, both for reconstruction work and for east-west freight transport.</p>

<p>Investigation Reveals That the Township Chief of Chashan Is Diligent and Honest and Did Not Arrest Villagers</p>
<p>A letter from the Jinshan County Government states: Dear Editor: We have received your letter regarding the posting of the article "Such a Township Chief," and we have read it carefully. In order to determine the truth of the matter, we extracted the key points and dispatched a competent official to conduct a detailed on-site investigation to clarify the truth. According to the report from the official, the Township Chief of Chashan, Feng Shuliu, read this article and, in order to clarify the truth, has submitted a letter requesting a correction. The villagers of the township also believe that the matter is groundless and are indignant. They have gone everywhere to investigate secretly and openly, and all claim that there is no such fact. Furthermore, merchants and civilians such as Neng Xiehe, Weng Shengxing, and Wang Tongxing have provided written proof stating that Township Chief Feng Shuliu has worked diligently since taking office on December 12 of last year and has been commended by former District Chief Guo. Regarding the claim made by a Chashan villager in the "Reader's Opinions" column of the Shen Bao on July 26 that he was personally detained and extorted by Township Chief so-and-so, resulting in a loss of 20 dan of rice, and that the ignorant villager was also threatened, resulting in a loss of more than 30 dan of rice, and was detained again, these claims are purely false and completely fabricated. Among the more than 500 households in our township, no one has been arrested for committing a crime recently. Since there is no such person, how can there be such a thing? Therefore, the citizens dare to provide evidence that this is the truth. I also met with Township Chief Feng Shuliu and repeatedly questioned him about the facts reported in the newspaper. He replied that there was indeed no such thing in his township, and that he did not know whether there were similar reports in neighboring townships. Therefore, I have compiled a document reporting the findings of the investigation and respectfully request your review. While the investigation was underway, we also received a telegram from Tang Yu and Dong Xingzhuang, the captain and vice-captain of the third detachment of the seventh district team of the Youth Corps of our county, stating that the facts regarding Township Chief Feng Shuliu of Chashan Township being falsely accused, and the evidence provided by merchants and civilians such as Xiehe, are completely consistent. From this, it can be seen that the facts stated in the article were not committed by Township Chief Feng Shuliu of Chashan Township. In addition to ordering the district chief to investigate other townships for similar matters and report back for further investigation, we have specially sent this letter to your publication detailing the investigation and ask that you disclose it in your newspaper to correct any misperceptions. Sincerely, The Jinshan County Government, August 10.</p>

<h3>Preparation for the Asian Labor Conference</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Today's world is almost a labor world, and future world issues will likely be mostly labor issues. Labor issues are a product of the Industrial Revolution. The direct confrontation between laborers and capitalists has become an unavoidable reality of modern society. Capitalists want to preserve their "vested interests," while laborers want to obtain their "right to survival." The labor issue is indeed a major problem; if this problem is not resolved, other problems will be difficult to resolve, and the world will forever have troubles and disturbances.</p>
<p>The International Labor Office believes that Asian labor has unique characteristics, so on May 19 of this year, it invited China and other related countries to discuss holding an "Asian Labor Conference." At the beginning of the discussion, there was a dispute over the location of the conference. The Indian representative requested it be held in India, while the Chinese representative naturally requested it be held in China. After some debate, a compromise was reached, resolving to hold a preparatory meeting in India in January of next year, and a formal conference in China the year after.</p>
<p>Now, there are only four full months until the preparatory meeting. In order to prepare for this, the Ministry of Social Affairs recently organized the "Asian Labor Conference Preparatory Committee." The members of this committee are senior officials and experts and scholars from relevant agencies. The formation of this committee seems somewhat late in terms of timing, and the invited committee members are not yet sufficiently comprehensive in terms of experts and scholars. Because the agency representatives are not selected by the agencies and some are not in charge of the relevant matters, there is concern that they may be ineffective. However, the fact that there is this preparation, that it is not sloppy or careless, is truly commendable. After all, there has been great progress in Chinese officialdom.</p>
<p>The countries invited to the Asian Labor Conference are designated as China, India, Siam, and the Philippines. As for whether Korea, Malaya, Annam, Burma, Java, Ceylon, etc., should send representatives or only send advisors has not yet been determined. How the United States, Britain, France, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, etc., which have close ties with Asia, should participate is still under study. I believe that Korea and the Malay states absolutely, absolutely need to have representatives present with voting rights. The British and Dutch states can only be invited as observers, to assist and guide and listen to the call of this conference. Australia must not be formally included in this Asian conference, firstly because of the different geography; Australia itself is a continent. If it is included in this conference, there will inevitably be a regrettable "mismatch in name." Secondly, their labor standards are very high, and it seems somewhat incompatible to compare them together. Asian Near Eastern countries such as Arabia, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iran must have representatives to attend the meeting; they are not currently included and must be strongly advocated for. We also hope that the Soviet Union will have observers to join, to see the other side of labor. All these proposals should be decided by a subcommittee authorized by the Board of Directors. Our country has been elected as one of the members of that committee. How will we fulfill the responsibilities of a member, and how will we benefit the laborers of small and weak nations in Asia?</p>
<p>The agenda of the preparatory meeting is divided into four categories: (1) the organization of social security, (2) general labor policies and their implementation, (3) annual implementation plans for social standards set by conventions and recommendations that have not yet been ratified and implemented by the relevant countries, and (4) the general economic background of social policies, including industrialization and other issues. Hidden behind these four major issues are many, many complex problems, and the unique characteristics of Asian labor do not seem to have been fully stated.</p>
<p>I believe that the special characteristics of Asian labor issues, different from those in Europe and the United States, are twofold: one is colonial-style labor, and the other is overseas Chinese labor. Industry in various parts of Asia is backward, and foreign economic aggression stifles development, which has made industrialization impossible. After the war, foreign goods flooded in, exacerbating the severity of the problem. Therefore, the Asian labor issue is not only a simple economic problem, or a political problem, or a political and economic problem, but a comprehensive integration of national, political, and economic issues. The Asian labor issue is already inseparable from the national issue. To be liberated from the oppression of international capitalism, only the liberation of the national issue can lead to the liberation of the labor issue.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese labor is closely related to colonial labor. In places where there are many indigenous people in colonies, the necessary labor can certainly utilize the labor of the indigenous people. However, if the indigenous people are not yet civilized and are still engaged in a naive, self-sufficient economic life, their labor is not suitable for the colonialists' capitalist management purposes. Therefore, it is not possible to follow the principle of free contract, and direct or indirect coercion is often used. In colonies with few indigenous people and low efficiency, it is necessary to prevent the emigration of indigenous people and promote the immigration of foreign laborers. Under the characteristics of colonial labor policy, our overseas Chinese laborers become victims.</p>
<p>The most extreme form of forced labor is the slave system, which enslaves the indigenous people on the one hand, and imports slaves from outside on the other. Foreign slaves, like livestock, are merely providers of labor, and their labor is exploited as much as possible. The profits of the slave trade are often from 50% to 200%. Coolie labor is a variation of slavery. In the mid-19th century, after the partition of Southeast Asia by the great powers, Chinese people changed from free immigrants to contract immigrants. Contract immigration involves foreign governments or commercial organizations recruiting laborers in China, and the term and treatment are stipulated in a specific contract, which actually contains the nature of slave trade, which is what we call "selling piglets" and foreigners call "coolie trade." Chinese people are able to endure hardship, are obedient, and have low wages, making them the most suitable laborers, especially in subtropical and tropical regions. White people are not adapted to the climate, and the indigenous people are lazy. There is no one more suitable for labor than the Chinese people. Therefore, various countries compete to recruit contract Chinese laborers.</p>
<p>Even today, there is still harsh contract Chinese labor recruitment. For example, recently, the British company Great Britain Lien-zhi Company recruited three translators, 216 mechanics, and 970 laborers in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to work on the islands of Ocean Island and Nauru Island. There are many harsh provisions in the recruitment charter. For example, the recruited Chinese laborers must be selected by the company's Hong Kong agent, Li Rongshidon Company, and examined by a doctor. However, it is also stipulated that the Chinese laborers must undergo another examination by the local government before landing. Those who do not meet the standards will be sent back to Hong Kong. This is tantamount to canceling the Hong Kong inspection. If unfair treatment is encountered before landing, the Chinese laborers will suffer losses, and the company will not care. The daily working hours are as long as nine hours or more, which is clearly inconsistent with the eight-hour working system decided by the International Labor Conference. The compensation for death due to work is only the worker's full-year salary, which is too little. The compensation fee in the UK is usually 36 to 40 months of the worker's income, why do you discriminate against me? These are all issues, and I hope that the authorities will make a special proposal during the conference.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that the Chinese laborers in the Siberian region of Russia endure harsh winds and ice on their beards, and after hard work, the wages they earn cannot be remitted to their homeland to support their parents and wives. When returning home, luggage and clothing are strictly restricted, and cash is absolutely not allowed to be taken out of the country. With such special treatment, what should be done during the conference?</p>
<p>The collection of materials for the conference is also a crucial issue. The sanctity of labor did not originate in the West. In ancient China, labor was highly respected. Isn't there a record of the "Examination of Craftsmen"? "The country has six offices, and artisans occupy one of them." This time, Chinese labor data must be collected universally and in depth. The deadline for collection is November of this year. Within these three months, we must make double the effort and sweat. We must gather the sweat and blood of many people, concentrate our efforts, and work diligently without any slack. Relevant government agencies, from the central to the local levels, should have specialized personnel to bury themselves in the work of comprehensive analysis. The original materials obtained by relevant academic institutions, schools, newspapers, social groups, and even individual research institutes should be diligently requested from them. The person in charge of collection must be like mercury, penetrating everywhere. Because this conference is a groundbreaking one. Because this conference is to be compared with India, Siam, and other countries, nothing can be done without materials, and it is truly self-defeating not to collect the available materials. At the same time, the Chinese people should automatically contribute everything they know and have to the conference. This is not to show off, it is a matter of national honor.</p>
<p>In addition to the agenda, future proposals should also be based on conscience, with many temporary proposals. The speeches at the conference, the speeches of labor and capital, must be studied with some thought. The most important thing is that the figures spoken by each person must be absolutely the same. At this time, the organization of a proposal group is urgently needed. Our country can have at least twenty people in the delegation. The selection of such people must be based on standards, and it is necessary to find specialists in various fields. Because the effectiveness of everything depends on people. Not just anyone can go to the meeting, otherwise, the topic will not be addressed, and only deepen our shame. The selection of personnel must be decided within the next month so that everyone can prepare early, to avoid digging a well when facing the sea.</p>
<p>There are approximately seven million overseas Chinese workers scattered throughout Asia. They must have their own voice at the conference, which is a matter of course. Is it reasonable to be a representative of local labor and capital? Can we negotiate with the local people without causing competitive conflicts? Will there be policy contradictions with the ruling government? What techniques do we use to achieve satisfactory results for all three parties? All these require prior arrangements and preparations.</p>
<p>Forewarned is forearmed; unprepared, undone. We must prepare quickly, preparing to hold a thorough conference. (Written on the 35th, 8th, and 14th in the capital.)</p>

<h3>"Orphans, Widows, Poor, and Sick" Cry Out for Food, Hoping Compassionate Readers Will Provide a Steady Stream of Assistance</h3>
<p>Let everyone come to save the most pitiful people in society!</p>
<p>Since the "Orphans, Widows, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund" entrusted to this newspaper by Elder Qingxia began operating on June 29, a total of four batches, 24 people, have been approved, with an expenditure of 1.82 million yuan in subsidies. To date, there is a surplus of 291,000 yuan, and recently, letters of request from "orphans, widows, the poor, and the sick" in this city have been received almost daily. There are also lonely old and young people coming to the newspaper office to ask for relief. In addition to expressing sympathy and comfort, we really feel helpless to provide assistance! In this Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, from heaven to hell, the unequal distribution of happiness and suffering cannot be fully described in words. The miserable situation of this group of orphans and helpless people is even worse than that of ordinary poor people. Our purpose in providing "orphans, widows, the poor, and the sick" relief is no different from lending a hand to them in a deep pit of fire and water. However, to save them, even the minimum passive measures require money. Where does the money come from? This is an urgent issue. We hope that compassionate and loving readers will lend a hand and donate some money, whether it is 10,000 or 20,000 yuan, or even better, 50,000 or 100,000 yuan. Small amounts add up to make them all survive in hopeless situations. The merit is truly immeasurable.</p>

Before leaving, she left a letter saying: Respectfully, I am a dance partner at the MGM Ballroom. Recently, Shanghai launched a "Dance Queen Election" to raise money for the Northern Jiangsu refugees. I am extremely grateful for the visits from all sectors. I originally had no intention of participating in the election, but seeing the enthusiastic relief efforts from all sectors, I would like to donate one million yuan of legal tender saved from my income to my Northern Jiangsu compatriots. This small amount is just a token of my heart, and I hope you will accept it on my behalf. Respectfully,</p>

<h3>Selfish Good People</h3>
<p>— Zhao Dan</p>
<p>Before an actor plays a role, someone always asks him, "Are you playing a good guy or a bad guy?" This makes it difficult for an experienced actor to answer, because the personality of a character cannot really be encompassed by the two words "good guy" and "bad guy." For example, Hu Si in "Sunrise" is a 27-year-old young man; if you say he is a righteous young man, he is actually an idler; if you say he is a villain, he does not plot anything or do anything bad. Especially for an actor, he should not be confined by this bloodless and meaningless term. Otherwise, he will play all the characters into a completely identical stereotype. An actor's creation of a character must start from his inner emotions and thoughts; after he has completed the creation of this character and expressed it on the screen or stage, then it is up to others to affirm or deny its existence value. Therefore, we should not call a living, flesh-and-blood character by that vague and general term, nor should we simply determine the identity of a character in that way, but should start from their thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>This time in "Distant Love," I am playing a professor. This role simply cannot be encompassed by a fixed term. The director once joked, "A bad guy who is not a bad guy." Like such a character, neither villain nor righteous, neither affirmation nor denial can encompass the character's personality and actions. So, how should this be said? In my opinion, it should be said: a selfish good person whose thinking remains in the 1940s.</p>
<h3>How to Learn Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Xuan Lu</p>
<p>Recently, the trend of learning Kunqu opera has become quite popular. National institutions of higher learning, in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, have mostly established "Kunqu Selections" credits in the compulsory curriculum of the Chinese Literature Department of the School of Liberal Arts to impart knowledge. There are also many elegant people in society who take pleasure in humming a few Kunqu opera tunes, and even young ladies from prominent families are enthusiastically participating. So-called Kunqu societies and elegant gatherings have become fashionable for a time. In China, there is no lack of people who simply seek entertainment and cater to the current trends, but there are also many who are moved by the beautiful art of music, who are concerned that this tune is about to become extinct, and who therefore sacrifice a part of their spirit to explore the true essence of national music, and who take it as their responsibility to continue what is broken, preserve what remains, revive what is in decline, and repair what is damaged.</p>
<p>However, this art has been declining for a long time, and the lack of talents is particularly severe today. Generally, those who teach in institutions of higher learning have more than enough literary talent, but are not familiar with the ancient laws. When they teach Kunqu opera, they simply select a few short tunes or scattered suites from books such as "Yongxi Music Palace," "Yangchun White Snow," "New Sounds from the Court and the Countryside," and "Excerpts from Lyrical Orders," or select a few Northern and Southern tunes from books such as "Selections from Yuan Drama," "Prosperous Ming Miscellaneous Drama," or "Sixty Kinds of Kunqu Opera," and ask students to recite and chant them. When they lecture on Kunqu studies, they simply pick up the leftovers of recent scholars such as Wang Guowei and Wu Mei and make no new discoveries. As for how to coordinate with the musical modes and how to accompany with wind and string instruments, the teachers are not familiar with it, and the students have never heard of it. In other words, the musical component of Kunqu opera has been abandoned, and attention is paid only to the literary component. As a result, teaching Kunqu opera is no different from teaching poetry, and learning Kunqu opera is no different from learning poetry. Teaching this unique art in such a way, there is little hope that Kunqu opera can be preserved.</p>
<p>Secondly, those who teach Kunqu opera in society are so-called flute teachers, commonly known as "paixian" (short for "paiqu xiansheng," or "tune-beating teacher"), who are mostly former veteran actors or those who play accompaniment in the Liyuan Garden (i.e., the so-called "stage"), and although their art has been passed down from teachers, they mostly have art but no learning, that is, they have art but have not progressed to the Tao.</p>
<p>Those who teach Kunqu opera are no more than the above two types of people, so it is inevitable that our country's Kunqu opera will be lost. Why do I say this? Because those who learn Kunqu opera under the professors of universities only know how to read Kunqu opera like reading poetry, and compose Kunqu opera like writing poetry. As for the achievements and advantages of Kunqu opera in music and drama, they "regret not learning." Those who learn Kunqu opera under the flute teachers only know how to open their throats and rest, but do not know what Kunqu studies are, or what Kunqu laws are, just like parrots learning to speak, similar but only similar. What is the meaning of it, they stare blankly and do not know how to respond. The two do not run parallel without contradicting each other, but actually go in opposite directions and become disjointed. It is no wonder that the art of Kunqu opera is gradually dying out and even perishing.</p>
<p>The author has been a university professor, teaching the "Kunqu Selections" course in the School of Liberal Arts, and has also been a volunteer flute teacher, participating in so-called Kunqu societies and elegant gatherings. Having personally experienced the joys and hardships of both, I can still speak about them briefly.</p>
<p>I believe that there are three steps to learning Kunqu opera: first, tune recitation; second, music notation; and third, composition. These three must be advanced step by step, and it is not possible to leapfrog ahead, but because of their close and inseparable relationship, it is absolutely impossible to abandon the other two when advancing to a certain stage. In other words, although those who are learning tune recitation have not yet reached the stage of music notation, they cannot fail to understand the theories and rules of music notation and composition. Otherwise, their learning process will be twice the effort for half the result, and the level they can only achieve will be mechanical and lack artistic spirituality. At the same time, those who learn composition must also be proficient in the skills of music notation and tune recitation, and those who learn music notation must also be rich in the talent of composition and tune recitation. Otherwise, it will be like armchair strategy, impractical, and will also encounter obstacles everywhere, making it impossible to write. Because the relationship between the three is linked in a chain, and absolutely cannot be severed. Today's Kunqu opera learners, whether they come from the School of Liberal Arts of a university or from a Kunqu society, all cut this chain into three, and this is a major reason for the decline of Kunqu opera.</p>
<p>According to the author's view, although it is not necessary to advance the three (composition, music notation, and tune recitation) at the same time when learning Kunqu opera, the teacher must integrate the three into one furnace, so that the students can have the joy of drawing inferences from one instance and avoid the suffering of playing the se with glued-down pegs. Therefore, the teaching method should be different from the traditional mechanical and rigid teacher-student transmission method.</p>
<p>I believe that teaching any discipline must have a plan. This plan must first conduct a complete observation of the entire picture of this discipline, and then dissect it in an organized manner, so as to divide it into several equally spaced parts that are interconnected, and then formulate a schedule according to the depth and difficulty of each part, differentiating between the order of precedence. Such a division of equal parts, divided into stages, combined to form a whole, is a planned teaching method. Learning any discipline cannot escape this formula. As for Kunqu opera, because it has not yet become an organized discipline, and scholars are mostly accustomed to the traditional teacher-student transmission method and do not know how to reform, so no planned teaching method has yet been produced. The author, despite his ignorance, intends to make an attempt in this regard.</p>
<h3>Diana Ping and Her Half-Year-Old Daughter.</h3>
<p>— Special dispatch from the New York Times</p>
<h3>Watching the Performance of "Spring Cold"</h3>
<p>— Kou Jiabi</p>
<p>When "Spring Cold" was performed in Chongqing the year before last winter, not only was the audience packed, but it also received unanimous praise from the news and cultural circles. Especially the acting skills of the actors left an indelible impression on my mind.</p>
<p>In this hot summer, "Spring Cold" opened at the "Lyceum". Most of the actors were the original cast. Tao Jin played the old doctor Zhou Pu. He not only grasped a typical appearance, but also excavated the character's inner personality to the depths of his soul. I saw a Zhou Pu on stage who was simple in life, upright in character, serious in attitude, and kind in heart, but I didn't see Tao Jin's spirit of "hitting the vital point."</p>
<p>The female doctor Fang Jieru, through the creation of Shu Xiuwen, who had artistic cultivation, became a living being with flesh and blood. She revealed the character's sincere enthusiasm, empty dreams, pure heart, and weak will without reservation, winning the audience's infinite sympathy. Although the actress fulfilled her greatest duty, because the character itself was limited by the script, she could not show her high level of performing arts in the process of performing.</p>
<p>In many plays, I have seen that all the villains are played by the actors as so-called negative characters. This is because the actors want to achieve a strong effect on the audience, so they try their best to make people disgusted in their dialogues and actions. He Zhiyuan in "Spring Cold" is a big man. He is a character who makes money in the pool of eating people. He hides his sinister heart and despicable means under a generous and solemn appearance and a noble temperament. He is indeed a unique archetype in today's society. Zong You performed very well, but his speech was not in line with the public.</p>
<p>Liu Li played the young boy He, but his dialogue and actions were not unconstrained enough, lacking a slippery air. Bai Chen played Section Chief Ren Boqin, and he had already achieved the insidious and treacherous character, but his dialogue was too low, and many lines were unclear. Jiang acted as the county magistrate rarely exhibiting much Yang, only achieving a simple appearance and a clean heart, lacking a strong temperament and the status of a county magistrate, so his performance was not very capable. Xia Tian played Ren Shiqi, the president of Tongshan Society, and created a complete character for him, but his makeup was too old. His performing actions, tone, and expression all showed that he was relatively young. Therefore, I felt that he was old but "too" strong.</p>
<p>Tong Man read Zheng Xu fen, the little nurse, Fang Bo played Wu Ziqing, the principal, Wang Wei played Mrs. Cai, the principal's wife, and Qiang Ming played Wu Qi, the reporter. Although they were in secondary positions in the play, they all fulfilled their due responsibilities and were just right. In short, the artistic level of this performance was more in-depth than Dai Qing's performance.</p>
<p>In just one month, I watched four plays, and I also saw many famous and accomplished actors. Their performances can indeed make the audience clap their hands and applaud, but in the entire performance, there is a lack of collective cooperation, and it cannot become a complete performance. Although the actors in "Spring Cold" have their strengths and weaknesses, they are serious about theatrical art, their attitude is serious, and their spirit is always tireless. In this period of drama misfortune, we need more solemn performances and complete artistic works.</p>
<h3>Review of "A Family of Loyalty and Righteousness"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Defeng</p>
<p>Qin Yi in "Distant Love"</p>
<p>"A Family of Loyalty and Righteousness" is the first domestic film after the victory. It finally met the cultural circles on August 5 at the Great Light Cinema. This long-awaited first dystocia film is of course to be given special attention and viewed in a different light. According to the general comments in recent days, there are divergent opinions, each with its own reason, and even started a war of words!</p>
<p>Here, based on my personal prejudice, I would like to say a few words. First of all, I want to say: this is a movie worth seeing by the general public, and even a movie that must be seen. The story is very ordinary, depicting the cruelty of the enemy and puppets and the ugliness of traitors during the period when Shanghai was occupied. It develops its story with a family that is hardworking, enduring, loyal, and steadfast. Here are: blockades and food shortages, rice dealers being robbed and shot, enemy soldiers letting dogs bite people, buying household registration rice and being flogged, being forced to subscribe to the "Xin Shen Bao", using public office for private revenge to be caught by the military police team and forced to drink water and be subjected to electric shocks, searching for terrorists, and other cruel acts, all in full view. I believe that people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time, these scenes are all facts that they have heard and witnessed in the previous period; perhaps many people have experienced them; although time will pass and they will forget, it is inevitable that their impressions will fade. Watching this movie is like reliving the past, which will make you feel cold and your hair stand on end; it will arouse a kind of angry emotion and a psychology of revenge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Hua family? It just shows the spirit of righteousness that cannot be subdued by force or tempted by wealth. Liu Qiong plays two roles alone. Although there is little room for young Wei Gang to play, there is a lot of room for him to play the old father.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the whole play is very sad, making the audience's emotions sink into the painful plot. I secretly saw many female audience members wiping their tears with handkerchiefs, which proves that this film has received the due effect in the hearts of the audience.</p>
<h3>Weekly Movie Short Review</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>There are still very few particularly good movies this week. "Loyal Dog Seeks Master" is better, but it seems that the director lacks strength in the part of the people.</p>
<p>Loyal Dog Seeks Master</p>
<p>The script is simple, but the insertion of the old rural couple and the two street performers is not bad. The director's handling of the dog is excellent. Lan Xi's eyes are very deep and touching. The ferocity of the big black dog and the cuteness of the little white dog are both very successful. However, apart from the old couple in the countryside, the people are not good. In the grand reunion scene between the little master and Lan Xi, the atmosphere can be lowered on the side of the little master before he is seen, because it is easier to create a good climax after the lowering.</p>
<p>You Feng Xi Long</p>
<p>The story is completely Americanized. The director often creates good jokes and has a unique writing style. Several characters, such as the detective, the shopkeeper, and the old man, are interspersed well.</p>
<p>Li Quelen plays the best, naturally depicting the personalities of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>The ending is not bad, not clichéd.</p>
<p>Fire Line Heroine</p>
<p>The play is calm and only becomes active after being straightforward. The handling is not bad, but it is too long, which is also where the director has not succeeded.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert is very competent. Sonny Tufts made his debut on the screen here, and his performance is not bad.</p>
<p>The plane bombing is not as good as the opening of "Bataan Island Bloodbath", so it is said that the director is not outstanding.</p>
<p>Silver Screen Orioles</p>
<p>Introduces forty-eight starlets, but unfortunately, none of them have good results. However, here we can see several conversation scenes of Bao Caiqi, which are quite flexible and solid. However, the music team and dancing tricks of six groups of dozens of people are all terrible because he did not give them a wide enough space, which is Bao Caiqi's biggest mistake.</p>
<p>A Socialite's Love Affairs</p>
<p>When light comedies are quite scarce, this film is Liao Hua in Shu, but when such films come in droves, it will be relatively inferior, as long as you compare it with "Professional Woman" and "You Feng Xi Long".</p>
<p>Except for some small gimmicks in the dialogue, the whole film has no brilliance in terms of technique, such as the several repetitive interior scenes in the car, which also seem very boring.</p>
<p>Across the Pacific</p>
<p>The scattered script is the biggest problem of the play. Humphrey Bogart does not show his personality. Mary Astor plays the worst. In comparison, the two Chinese actors are more successful, but they are not very clever.</p>
<p>The director is good in a few scenes, which is in the first half. In the second half, he, like the screenwriter, entered a sleepy state.</p>
<p>Double-Gun Lone Ranger</p>
<p>This is the worst film. The director has no spirit in the whole film. The first scene seems to be able to be deleted. The scene of the strong man fighting the villain at the end is too hasty. Even Sonny Tufts, who has the best performance, did not create a good atmosphere when he was sentenced to hang.</p>
<p>White Perlan Brighton plays the best and is a promising member.</p>
<p>The best actors in this time are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Lan Xi (dog), in "Loyal Dog Seeks Master".</p>
<p>(2) Li Que Lun, in "You Feng Xi Long".</p>
<p>(3) White Perlan Brighton, in "Double-Gun Lone Ranger".</p>
<p>There are too few good actors this week, and it is simply impossible to pull them out. Reluctantly speaking, Claudette Colbert in "Fire Line Heroine" and Roti Aikers in "Loyal Dog Seeks Master" can be listed as second-class.</p>

<h3>Duponno</h3>
<p>— Xi Shou</p>
<p>Henri Duvernois (1875-1936) was born in Paris and was a versatile and intelligent writer. His output was as abundant as an inexhaustible spring. He wrote more than seventy volumes in his lifetime. Duvernois left his family very early and lived a wandering life. At first, he worked as a recorder in the Charpentier Bookstore and met many celebrities. Around the age of twenty, he worked hard to write and submit articles to newspapers (Le Journal), Parisian Life (Vie Parisienne), Femina, and other publications. He wrote in a humorous, relaxed, and interesting style, writing everything that could make the writer happy. In 1903, he published his first full-length novel, The Iron Reed (Le Roseau ce ler). The following year, he published Husband and Wife's Bed (Nane ou le lit conjugal), which showed some talent. He was not complacent and continued to work hard, writing Crapotte (1908), which immediately shocked the French literary world.</p>
<p>Duvernois mostly wrote about what he had seen with his own eyes, because in his wandering youth, he had already met a group of vagrants, mad girls, ridiculous inventors, frivolous people, rogues, and swindlers, etc. He collected them all into his novels. Fifinoiseau (1913, short story collection), The Dog Who Speaks (Le chien qui parle, 1913, short story collection), etc., are all his small masterpieces. Duvernois's first period of works contained a bit of superficial optimism and were mostly inseparable from the scenes on the street, which can be simply called street literature.</p>
<p>Since Duvernois matured, he had a deeper understanding of life. His second period of great works can be modeled on the novel Dead Beast (Morte la bete 1925). Duvernois mixed the funny with the tragic, thought with emotion, and had moved far away from the street and abandoned superficial optimism.</p>
<p>Duvernois's third period of works was biased towards drama. His attractive dialogue was praised by the public. During this period, he initially wrote some short plays and small comedies, such as The Club of Mandarin Ducks (Le club ces canards Mandarins), which was a resounding success. The characters and themes in Duvernois's plays were mostly drawn from his previous novels.</p>
<p>Duvernois was a keen observer who expanded his impressions and used a novel pen, giving people a new concept. His rich imagination was truly amazing. He wrote about all kinds of individual characters in an engaging way. Duvernois was a first-class contemporary French writer. He created many characters, as active and moving as Balzac. He told those events in a low and light tone, like telling secrets, dealing with those familiar characters in a realistic attitude. Superb technique combined with rich emotions, humor, and unpredictable endings, gave us the feeling that each work was his best masterpiece. Now, most writers escape from reality to fantasy, while Duvernois is the opposite, escaping from fantasy to reality. Duvernois is a writer who only knows Parisian society and specializes in writing about Parisian customs.</p>
<h3>Uncle Big Head Cried!</h3>
<p>— Harry</p>
<p>When Fan Datou first arrived in Xicun, people said he was a monster because his head was terribly big, bright, and bald, without a single hair, and his face was covered with scars, like a three-dimensional map. The skin of his left eyelid was turned up by a scar, so his eyes seemed to be angry forever!</p>
<p>As time went by, people realized that he was a good man. He worked hard and thriftily, he liked children, and he often told them stories, listening to each child so attentively that their saliva dragged at the corners of their mouths, a foot long.</p>
<p>One day, the sun was hanging high, without a single piece of floating cloud. Along a stream, Fan Datou hesitated alone, with his head down and his face not looking very good. Suddenly, a group of children swarmed over:</p>
<p>"Uncle Big Head, tell us a story!"</p>
<p>"Don't make noise! I'm not in the mood today!" He said, shrinking his right hand into his sleeve, grabbing the cuff, and wiping it all over his bald head.</p>
<p>"Hmm, tell us! We all want to listen." The children were concerned about his coarse cloth shirt, one pulled at it, the other pushed it; Fan Datou looked at this group of innocent lives, and two shadows floated in his mind...</p>
<p>He finally sat down on a large rock by the stream, "cough!" Spitting a mouthful of yellow phlegm into the stream, and then wiping his lips with his sleeve.</p>
<p>"Okay, let me tell you another story! Once upon a time, there was a carpenter, who had a wife and a son. Because of thrift, the family was still doing well. His wife was so virtuous! She was busy with housework all day long, and when the carpenter returned, she had to serve her man to wipe his body and wash his feet. She never spoke loudly, was considerate to her husband, and also liked children, she...."</p>
<p>——He kept his head down, looking at the water illuminated by the sun into millions of pieces of gold and silver, his eyes were rolling, full of tears.</p>
<p>"That child was also really likable, with a round face, big eyes, dark and black, looking at people, as dazzling as this water!</p>
<p>——He bent down, subconsciously holding the flowing water in his hands, a few drops of tears fell into the flow, none of the children noticed.</p>
<p>"At that time, like you, I told stories to people every day. He was very well-behaved, never making a fuss, and would even sing along with adults... But out of nowhere, a war broke out. The planes dropped a big bomb with a rumbling sound. Damn it, it landed right at the carpenter's door, ah! That was scary! Boom...."</p>
<p>"Ah! Then what about the carpenter and his wife and children?"</p>
<p>"Don't interrupt! Alas, I will never forget it. The child cried and shouted for his mother, the woman held the child tightly, just a burst of sound, boom, the bomb flew straight towards their heads, only ah, everything was over... The smoke and fog became a mess. I, no, that carpenter wanted to rush over, but it was too late, letting the flames spray on his face, burning like needles...."</p>
<p>He stopped here; his hand, trembling, touched his face, which was covered with sores!</p>
<p>"Did the carpenter never see his wife and children again?"</p>
<p>The children asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" Some sobs.</p>
<p>"Then what about the carpenter? Tell us! Uncle Big Head, what happened later?"</p>
<p>"Carpenter, carpenter... Alas! What else is there to say? Children, I only hope that you will never see war again in your life!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Uncle Big Head, why is your face wet, are you crying?"</p>
<p>"Uncle Big Head is crying!"</p>
<p>Yes, Uncle Big Head cried, loudly, with infinite anger, resentment, and sorrow.</p>
<h3>Joining the Army (World Honorary Selection)</h3>
<p>— Gore, Curator of the Zang London Guild of Fine Arts</p>
<p>Gore (W.H. Gore) was educated in art since childhood and entered the Royal Academy in 1880. "Joining the Army" was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1885. The background is the pasture of Kenannt Village, where the author grew up. The man in the painting has been conscripted into the army and is separating from his wheat. The sad feeling is overflowing the screen, which makes people want to cry.</p>
<h3>· Under the Eaves ·</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>That stubborn girl cried. Her face sadly showed the sallow color of malnutrition. The unfortunate mother stood beside her, with a shadow of sadness in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Go," the woman said helplessly: "No one will laugh, what does it matter to be barefoot! ..."</p>
<p>The weak girl suddenly cried even more sadly! Her tearful eyes stared at the raindrops under the eaves, holding a pair of small white cloth shoes with red trim, and wiping her tears with another thin little hand.</p>
<p>This is a sad thing. Does a child who is already ten years old not understand that not having a father is an irreparable regret in life?</p>
<p>I know how the girl's father died. This unfortunate woman will never forget it...</p>
<p>That man left silently. When he was still alive, maybe he could still give them a little happiness. I remember him as such a short man, his round eyes were dull and empty; his liver-colored lips were thick and upturned, as if he would not forgive anyone.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, he did the lowest-grade chores, washing dishes, carrying water, and wiping tables. He did not smile, and rarely spoke, even if he occasionally resisted someone's curse, it was just a vague roar that could not be heard.</p>
<p>He was often shirtless. He had no clothes to wear. His dark skin, thin face, and shaved head made people feel sorry for him just looking at him. Now this woman, his surviving wife, is the same as him; her hair is loose and dirty, and the pair of feet in the broken shoes make people think that she has probably not washed them with water for half a month. They only earned two meals.</p>
<p>It seems like a very, very long road has passed, but that was only last autumn.</p>
<p>The terrible plague danced in the village like a soul-reaping ghost, and at the same time, it was rumored that the enemy would soon arrive with burning and killing. It was a chaotic and sad season.</p>
<p>That man, alas, I really don't want to be trampled on by this painful impression again. His feet were exposed with cave-like red and swollen sores, but he still勉强 carried water bucket after bucket. Later, the woman temporarily replaced his labor, no, from then on she would always replace his labor.</p>
<p>There was a new pile of yellow soil on the hillside, and it was said that it was buried with two pieces of wood.</p>
<p>The woman's eyes were swollen terribly. The heart of sympathy was also swollen terribly, and what made the woman shed her last tear was the baby, who was only seven or eight months old, who also closely followed her unfortunate father and completed a life experience in the terror of the plague...</p>
<p>At this moment, I stood dumbfounded under the eaves, listening to the child sobbing. The morning sky was drizzling, and a series of impressions were cutting my memory. I knew she had sent her daughter to the nearby National School, but I didn't know that the child didn't understand her mother's heart.</p>
<p>"What is she crying about again?"</p>
<p>"It's raining, saying that other people have overshoes and she doesn't have overshoes, she refuses to go to school..."</p>
<p>At this time, a girl with two small braids walked past me. She was wearing a black dress, carrying a purple-red schoolbag, and her new rubber shoes were black and shiny. She looked at me and put up her umbrella, proudly walking into the misty rain.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Within a few months, her parents, one after the other, passed away. (There were many who died of grief in those times). She, a girl of fifteen or sixteen, at least had the heart and the plan. She first tried to close the shop. Closing a shop, how easy could it be? Under those circumstances, closing a shop was at least ten thousand times more difficult than opening one. Yet she managed to close it successfully. Although she didn't get a decent price, she managed to get some money back. Her plan was to go through the pass, to Beiping, or to Jinan. She had some classmates in Beiping and some old relatives in Jinan.</p>
<p>"At that time, I couldn't explain why, but after talking to her for a few words, I became very concerned." Tsurumi noticed the letter I had shown him and stared at it blankly. "Afraid that she might encounter ruffians or something, I accompanied her all the way home."</p>
<p>"You could say she was quite beautiful, not as artificial as Japanese women, and not as delicate as Chinese women. In my eyes, she could be described as healthy and beautiful. Innocent yet with a hint of cleverness, lively, but not frivolous—quite dignified. I say dignified, but you must know she was only fifteen or sixteen at that time."</p>
<p>"At that time, I was determined to make something of myself, so I wanted to seize the opportunity to cultivate some pure, healthy, new blood, so in the conversation, I gave her a little hint."</p>
<p>The next day, Tsurumi got her a pass, because at that time, the General Staff Headquarters was above all else, and Tsurumi was quite popular in the department, so he easily got the matter settled. At the same time, Tsurumi drafted a study plan for her and sent a subordinate to escort her secretly to Beiping.</p>
<p>From then on, Yaoqun, this daughter of the Northeast, was always under Tsurumi's protection. He directed her to a very prestigious missionary university, and her every move was reported. Whether spiritually or temperamentally, as soon as Yaoqun felt any unease, Tsurumi immediately improved or made up for it. After three years in university, Tsurumi felt that her general knowledge was sufficient, and at the same time, there were other opportunities, so he wrote a letter, advising her to leave the pass immediately and learn some special skills, skills indispensable for a career—shooting, jujutsu, first aid, reconnaissance, surveying, photography, code breaking, radio communication, military knowledge, horsemanship, driving, etc. The teacher was a special person, a Westerner who had naturalized in China.</p>
<p>"She is already an adult now. Her physique has grown to the right standard." Tsurumi became more and more excited, "I often sneak a peek when she is practicing, and I see that she is really diligent and willing to work hard."</p>
<p>"Brother, she is really in pain—mental depression—because she always thought that my surname was Gu, a Chinese soldier (a puppet soldier, but a person with ambition, ability, and a special mission). She corresponded with me in Beiping, and I had her send it to the Shenyang Post Office for forwarding. When I got outside the pass, I canceled this method and told her that I had traveled far away to other places."</p>
<p>"She is not a fool. She tried a few tricks to find out my whereabouts from her teacher. But, do you think she could succeed? She couldn't get any information from the post office either. Her only hope is the imagined words 'special mission.' This is also my only magic weapon to relieve her mental instability."</p>
<p>"Why don't I see her?" Tsurumi tried to suppress his emotions, but he couldn't hide a kind of pain. "Brother, please tell me, can I see her...?"</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Tsurumi stared at me sadly for a while, then gradually lowered his head, gradually crossed his strong and flexible hands, propped up his forehead, and covered his face. This is perhaps called "A hero's spirit is shortened by sentimental affection."</p>
<p>I also felt a kind of inexplicable loss, and instinctively picked up the thick stack of long letters again:</p>
<p>"Mr. Gu, I always remember that you said in one of your letters, 'When there are troubles in the country, maybe that's when we will meet.' You see, the affairs inside the pass have already started, haven't they? Why don't you let me meet you? Don't you need help?</p>
<p>"The only reason I can think of is that, although we have only had one or two short meetings, we have been friends for five or six years, and emotionally, we may be more than just casual acquaintances; you are afraid that once we meet, we will fall into the trap of ordinary love, thus delaying our cause."</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Not Mistaken</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A relative complained to me that he has been very worried about his housing and children (collectively called students) recently. He originally lived in a friend's house, but the landlord sold the house, and he had to move out. Where should he move to? There are many advertisements in the newspaper saying that houses require so many "gold bars" to take over, or so many "gold bars" to transfer, and he is not mistaken. He also knows how much each "gold bar" is worth, but the "gold bars" just don't listen to him.</p>
<p>He has five children in school. He thought that the provincial and municipal schools have already been tested, and he can't afford private schools. What should he do with his children? Fortunately, he caught up with the second enrollment of municipal middle schools, so he followed the enrollment advertisement in the newspaper and found a school closer to his friend's house to register his children. When he ran to the school, he saw a sign posted at the door saying that the school had "long" moved to a new location. He ran to the new location (the old and new locations are three or four miles apart). He walked straight into the office from the school gate and did not see any notices or signs indicating registration. Two staff members were sitting in the office, lazily saying: "Registering today? Our school has "long" decided that it is September 1st." He flipped through the newspaper he brought with him, and the school clearly stated the old address and that it was indeed the day to register. He was not mistaken.</p>
<p>Regarding housing, we hope that the actual elimination of transfer fees and bribes will prevent Shanghai's houses from being inextricably linked with "gold bars" forever. Regarding schools playing this kind of inexplicable game of snatching flowers to waste students' and parents' time and energy, we really can't think of any appropriate reason to treat students and parents as if they are asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Sighing and groaning, I wonder if the municipal authorities are as disgusted with this kind of thing as we are?</p>
<h3>Education, Education, Education!</h3>
<p>— Chen Yu</p>
<p>Because demand exceeds supply, the post-war recovery has brought many students, and recently there has been a shortage of schools again. Generally, public schools, due to the limited number of places, only want fewer students, not more. Teachers are happy to mark fewer papers, and school authorities can also reduce some troubles. As for the students outside the school gate, no matter how crowded they are, the school always ignores them, like a streetcar ticket seller, ignoring you. Private schools, although they want to accommodate more students to ease some expenses, but years of poor education, coupled with a serious housing shortage, even if they can barely maintain and not close down or change careers, they can't even think of establishing new schools, let alone have the surplus power to expand and improve!</p>
<p>Teachers who have been poor for many years seem to be able to vent some resentment, but this is not the time to vent resentment, nor is it an opportunity to hoard and profit. It is such a serious education problem. Can we just stand by and watch its evolution?</p>
<p>The emergency solution, of course, cannot be expected to be solved by the restoration of all schools. The only options here are to expand the number of places and add more classes. This is still easier for public schools to handle. Schools may apply to the authorities to allocate more enemy property, immediately stop selling enemy and puppet properties, and quickly find ways to renovate and use them.</p>
<p>During the founding of the country, education is the most important thing. Indeed, the importance of education in the founding of the country can be imagined. However, let's see how many educational supplies, such as books and instruments, have been imported since the victory a year ago. How much enemy property has been confiscated and allocated for higher education? On the contrary, it is often heard that soldiers occupy school buildings, such as the problems of Xinben and other schools, haven't they been going on for a long time? There is also the National Fudan University, which is said to have decided to run a summer school to prevent its dormitories from being occupied. Do you think it's interesting?</p>
<p>Thinking of the model airplane competition the day before yesterday, someone said that it is enough to arouse people's interest in aviation. However, we believe that modern Chinese people have already attached considerable importance to the aviation industry, especially the young people who are studying. They almost all know that the times attach importance to them, so most of them (it can be said all of them) are willing to work hard, study hard, research, and work hard, and they are all willing to dedicate themselves to the great project of building the country in the future. However, due to the limitation of the number of places, they are rejected en masse! The young group is turned back—discouraged!</p>
<p>Education first is not just a slogan, it should be expressed in facts and implemented practically and systematically!</p>
<p>The main reason why China is suffering today is education, and if we still don't work hard on education at this moment, I ask you: what can we do!</p>
<h3>Postal Rate Increase</h3>
<p>— Xu Hong</p>
<p>The postal rate increase that was rumored to be implemented soon has been temporarily suspended because the Executive Yuan did not consider it. It is said that it will be discussed again in two months, and the postal bureau's losses will be transferred from the national treasury.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seems to be a good measure by the authorities to not increase postal rates, reduce the burden on the people, and avoid stimulating price increases. However, on closer inspection, there are many inappropriate aspects of not increasing prices.</p>
<p>We always feel that those engaged in state-run enterprises should not have the mentality of making money, but they should not intentionally lose money either. In this time of rising prices, a reasonable adjustment is necessary. Each time the adjustment, if the rate of increase is not large, it will not easily stimulate prices. Adjusting in small increments can further reduce the stimulating effect on rising prices.</p>
<p>In terms of today's prices, a set of fritters costs one hundred yuan, and making a public phone call costs at least two hundred yuan, up to five hundred yuan, while sending a regular letter costs only twenty yuan. What kind of ratio is this? The price of twenty yuan was set seven months ago. How much have prices risen in the past few months? How many times have civil servants' salaries been adjusted? Why not let the postal bureau's only source of income, postal rates, increase? If the postal bureau's income and expenditure can still be balanced, we certainly do not approve of increasing prices. However, last month's losses reached one million yuan! After the salary adjustment for civil servants in August, the general increase was more than 50%, so we estimate that this month's losses will reach more than one and a half million yuan. Then, if the adjustment is really made two months later, then in these three months, the postal bureau's losses will reach four million yuan. It's good to be offset by the national treasury. However, is the national treasury abundant? Where does the money in the national treasury come from? Everyone knows that the national treasury is not abundant at all, and the money is collected from the people under various names! How many undertakings cannot be carried out because the country has no money! That is because the national treasury is not rich! And the country uses huge amounts of money from the inherently poor national treasury on unnecessary undertakings, we really don't understand!</p>
<p>Talking about stimulating prices, the last time the postal rate increased from one yuan per regular letter to twenty yuan per regular letter was enough to stimulate prices! From the twenty yuan per regular letter set in mid-January to the number that is sufficient to offset the postal bureau's income and expenditure in October, we estimate that it will be at least five to ten times. Increasing prices by five times, ten times, or twenty times at once is enough to stimulate price increases! If it had been increased by half a time two or three months ago, and then increased by one time recently, we dare to believe that such an increase is reasonable, necessary, and will not stimulate price increases, at least not as severely as adding five times, ten times, or twenty times at once!</p>
<p>Therefore, we want this time not to increase postal rates, but we object to increasing postal rates by five times, ten times, or twenty times at once! We also object to the method of offsetting the postal bureau's deficit with funds from the national treasury! We advocate a reasonable increase in prices. We hope that there will be an increase in prices soon so that the postal bureau's income and expenditure can be offset. After that, the salaries of civil servants will be adjusted once—of course, prices will have changed once—and the postal rates will be adjusted once, with the rate of increase based on offsetting the postal bureau's income and expenditure as much as possible while avoiding stimulating price increases. We dare to believe that a reasonable adjustment is necessary, and taking from the people and using it all for the people in a reasonable way is what everyone agrees with and supports!</p>

<h3>Busy</h3>
<p>— Jiuzhang</p>
<p>It is said that the philosopher Kant's life was the most regular. He walked from his home to the university at a certain time every morning, day after day for decades. A small shop opened on this road, and the clock in the shop was sometimes fast and sometimes slow, but it had to be adjusted when Mr. Kant appeared. However, according to some notes, this quiet and meticulous Kant also had insomnia one night. The next day, he was more than an hour late in walking to the University of Berlin. This made the owner of the small shop wonder and want to find out the reason why Mr. Kant had insomnia. In the evening, he learned that the revolution had broken out in Paris two days ago. There were no telegrams or radios in the eighteenth century, and Mr. Kant knew the news a day earlier than the small shop owner. Of course, Kant had to think through the affairs of the universe and life thoroughly, so he had insomnia for half the night, while the small shop owner must have been unmoved and continued his retail business.</p>
<p>Naturally, when mentioning the eighteenth century, comparing it with the twentieth century, even a stupid person like me would feel a strong contrast. Modern life is busy, and ancient life is leisurely, which is just a general concept. Why is work busy? Because there are machines, and because people have a competitive spirit. Entertainment also becomes busy, rushing to take a bus to the suburbs for recreation at a certain time, and rushing back to the city for a banquet at a certain time. When entertainment becomes a busy affair, the atmosphere of life changes, and it becomes modern. This is very different from the busy-ness of nothing in the Dream of the Red Chamber.</p>
<p>It is said that the famous people of the Jin Dynasty visited friends on snowy nights, but when they reached the door of their friends' houses, they did not go in. He said that he was only there to see the snow, "I came on a whim, and I will return when the whim is gone," why must I meet that friend? There are madmen in modern life, but no famous people.</p>
<p>Let me copy another short story. When England and Germany were at war and the United States had not joined, an American reporter stayed in Berlin. Paris fell. What did the people of Berlin say? What were their thoughts? Paris had fallen in 1871, and the Berliners were ecstatic: This time it was different. Everyone continued to work and continued to plan for a pseudo-life. The poorer people were still paying more attention to whether they could buy more rations than to the Western battlefield. The reporter said that it was not necessarily that the Nazis had numbed people to this extent, "It seems that everyone thought it was just being implemented according to the plans of the General Staff." According to their thinking, the General Staff was the person playing chess, and the frontline charge became the movement of chess pieces. Getting a famous city is like making a good move; and sacrificing some people is like sacrificing a few chess pieces.</p>
<p>In fact, I don't doubt that modern life requires organization, connection, tension, and busyness; but when people can forget themselves and be happy, they are still so serious, which may be a sign of mechanization. This is of course just an extreme example, but modern life should be a further development of human nature, not a rigidification of human nature, which is another big problem.</p>
<h3>The Life and Death of Books</h3>
<p>— Yingying</p>
<p>Modern students can comfort themselves with the saying: the two words "reading" have evolved from reading to death to reading to life. In the past, students read to death, which cannot be denied. They recited the Three Character Classic in the village school, but they didn't even know what "At the beginning of man, his nature is good" meant. If you asked the tutor, he would definitely hit your small forehead painfully. They only taught you to copy it onto the imperial examination paper, so you became a xiucai, juren, or even zhuangyuan, and your wish to read was over. Society and the country were completely separate matters.</p>
<p>While it was ridiculous for students to read in the past, it is very pitiful for students to read now. Of course, it is true that reading has recovered from reading to death to reading to life. But the so-called reading to life is just being able to explain each word one by one. After the explanation, what is the use? Teachers didn't think about it, and students didn't think about it either. The wish to read is still to hope to enter middle school, enter university, and even go abroad, and then it's over. The only improvement is that there is more explanation, although it avoids reading to death, but reading to life may be too alive and become virtual reading. There is no one in the modern education world who doesn't do this, which should not be denied. The biggest knot is forgetting practicality. Reading books should be able to be applied in a practical way, so that it is not considered virtual reading. As for reading to life while holding books and thinking about red lights and green wine, it is especially undesirable.</p>
<h3>Comic Strip: The Adventures of Sanmao the Soldier (78)</h3>
<p>— Drawn by Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>Accidental Insurance Fee</h3>
<p>— Qiren</p>
<p>Who says China is backward? Along with the victory, China has made great progress. Please take the following as proof:</p>
<p>Long-distance buses on the Xihu and Hutai highways require each passenger to pay an "Accidental Travel Insurance Fee" of 100 yuan when purchasing tickets, with an insured amount of 200,000 yuan. So passengers are guaranteed. If there is a car accident, a large amount of insurance money can be claimed, isn't this progress?</p>
<p>However, the progress is too tragic. Originally, the cost of living is so high. How many materials does a person need to consume to survive in this progressive China? The value of life seems that it may not be necessary to consider it. For example, our merciful insurance company directly values ​​human life at 200,000 yuan—the death of a person is equivalent to four shi of rice rotting in the warehouse; equivalent to losing a pig; or equivalent to a student's tuition for a semester.</p>
<p>As for this method of collecting insurance money, it is indeed the most clever. For the highway authorities, it can avoid the troublesome "liability issue" and be a win-win broker. For the insurance company, the insurance fee, which is not worth calculating, is quite considerable when collected every day.</p>
<p>From now on, Chinese law will have one more regulation: Causing death or injury to others due to negligence should be compensated with 200,000 yuan in damages; but "those who are not insured are not subject to this rule!"</p>
<h3>Everyone Abides by Traffic Laws; Order First, Safety First</h3>
<p>— Ren Long</p>
<p>The severity of Shanghai's traffic problems stems from both inherent deficiencies and acquired imbalances. The inherent deficiencies are Shanghai's buildings and streets, which lack planning and are chaotic, a problem that cannot be improved immediately. Now, let's be pragmatic and start with the acquired imbalances.</p>
<p>There are two objects of acquired imbalance: vehicles and pedestrians. Summarizing it, it's all a human problem. From now on, the world will be peaceful, and the number of vehicles in Shanghai will only increase. As for pedestrians, they will not decrease in this international commercial city in the future. However, the severity of the traffic problem lies not only in the large number of vehicles and the crowds of pedestrians, but also in whether Shanghai people abide by traffic regulations (Traffic Regulations); in other words, whether they are qualified to be residents of a metropolis.</p>
<p>Please Look at New York</p>
<p>For example, in New York, there are also many people and many cars. However, what is their traffic situation like? There, there are extremely many cars, one after another, driving slowly forward, sometimes even slower than running. Horns are simply left unused. At intersections, they drive strictly according to traffic signals. There is a certain speed limit, and if that limit is exceeded, traffic police will record the number and summon the car owner to the police station to be fined the next day. They maintain urban traffic order in an orderly manner. Frankly speaking, the solution to this problem is only two words: "obey the law." As for the strict organization and dedication of traffic police, that is purely a technical issue. However, this is also something our security authorities can emulate.</p>
<p>A Bloody Record</p>
<p>However, there is another serious matter related to traffic problems that deserves our consideration: this is the matter of vehicle accidents. We can note that the number of vehicle accidents in this city after the victory is increasing with time, without a single day passing without them. These cases pose an unlimited threat to the safety of citizens. The number of people who are sent to the afterlife every day, or who are crippled as a result, is countless. This is a problem that our security authorities and people from all walks of life should pay close attention to. Cases of people injuring or killing others due to careless driving usually fall into two categories: one is negligent, and the other is non-negligent. Non-negligent cases are settled with compensation, while negligent cases are handed over to the court for trial, sentencing, and compensation to resolve the matter. Non-negligent cases are naturally not a problem. However, dealing with negligent cases in that way may not be enough to encourage remorse. Therefore, I believe that the negligent driver should be forced by the police to accompany the injured person to the hospital or the corpse of the person who died from the injury to the morgue, and stay with them until the injured person recovers or the deceased is buried, and only after fulfilling the legal responsibility can they be released. Only in this way will he have the opportunity to witness the bloody consequences of his own negligence and feel remorse. I heard people in the hospital say that the situation of people who are injured or die as a result of car accidents is the most horrifying and tragic. Let the negligent driver take a look. I am afraid that he will never forget the tragedy he created and will never repeat the same mistake.</p>
<p>Film Promotion</p>
<p>In addition, in order to assist the authorities in maintaining traffic, film companies can also shoot short films specifically depicting the process of car accidents, especially the pain and suffering of the injured, which should be filmed in detail. Then, it should be screened in major theaters to make those who drive cars aware and vigilant. Psychologically, it can raise their awareness, thereby reducing the occurrence of tragedies. It is recently reported that the United States is also vigorously promoting the above-mentioned method. This method may have a great effect. I hope our security authorities pay attention to it.</p>
