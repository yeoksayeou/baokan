<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕京中商談形勢，仍在進展過程中，除中共代表團正待周恩來及延安方面之指示，無所活動外，政府與美方人士接觸頻繁，對於可能即日召開之會談，正積極準備中，政府準備發表之文件，日內即可公布。馬特使廿九日下午曾分別接見董必武及兪大維，對於主席接受調人新建議及對共黨之希望轉吿董必武，董亦曾以停戰問題再度提出硏討，此間談話經過，馬特使昨晚曾與司徒大使略予談及。</p>

<p>吳鼎昌邵力子談　認局勢即可明朗</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕司徒大使卅日晚宴客，其請柬雖係三日前所發，但宴叙時適逢和談局勢決定之今日，故敏感之新聞記者均於使館門首期待新聞人物。至八時十分，首先爲記者羣包圍者，乃吳文官長鼎昌，記者詢以今日宴會談話內容，據答：今日乃會談政府對三人，五人小組同時並進之商談方式已同意，現僅等待周恩來返京。某記者詢以政府是否將待國軍收復張家口後，再談停戰，吳答「吾」。過去東北停戰，有人認爲必須收復長春，熱河停戰必須收復承德·赤峯，其實決無必須張家口收復始談停戰者，吳對和談前途仍極抱樂觀，旋記者再訪赴宴之某氏，據稱：目前已達商談重開之決定階段，故今日所談，重要者仍爲和談程序問題，政府正式同意政治·軍事並進，三人·五人兩會同開此項意見將於一日由司使正式通知董必武，想局勢當立可開朗。政府讓步已自堅持五人會轉至先五人會後三人會，再至今日之三人五人同開，政府之忍讓，已至最後階段，但看共產黨最後一着棋矣。</p>

<h3>李迪俊宣慰荷印僑胞　絕無政治性任務　美軍駐華全爲協助遣俘</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕外部卅日下午三時舉行記者招待會，由情報司長何鳳山主持。各記者紛向何司長提出問題，（問）勝利以來南洋華僑備受欺凌，肆虐者多屬各地要求獨立之弱小民族，此或爲我國對彼等支特不力所引起，外交當局曾吾考慮修改政策？又，我對印尼進行交涉，是吾即已承認其爲交戰團體？何司長答：我對弱小民族之爭取自由，一向同情，主席且曾發表文吿，但將來措施，須視彼等對我之同情反響如何，至我對荷印雙方交涉，係保僑之實際需要，並未承認印尼爲交戰團體，此次李迪俊　使率領之宣慰團，絕　政治性任務，然其實地觀察之結果，或可供給政策方面以若干參政資料。</p>
<p>（問）對滬上最近發生之「美軍退出中國週」運動，外部觀感如何？</p>
<p>（答）美軍駐華，係接受我政府邀請，在中國戰區最高統帥之即制下，協同中國軍隊遣送敵國僑俘，年來功績殊偉，今尙未竟全功，一部份人別有用心，發起此項運動，殊有傷友誼，本人認爲至不適當。</p>
<p>（問）澀谷案件，最近之發展如何？此案現由美方軍事法庭主　，是否影響我方「被害人原則」對此案應有之管　權？</p>
<p>（答）　谷事件定卅日在東京開審，其所以由盟軍軍事法庭受理乃因當時東京僅由美軍佔領管制，而我駐日佔領軍尙未開到之故，然我方已派法官一人參加審理，代表我國行使　轄權。</p>
<p>（問）目前荷印各地與國內能否通匯？（答）荷印僑匯白戰爭結束後，荷印方面因外匯缺少，不允開放僑滙，而當地華僑又急需滙款國內，經本部與財部洽商一補救辦法，荷印華僑不久當可滙款返國。</p>
<p>（問）遣送僑機工事，最近有何發展？（答）戰爭期間，南洋各地返國效勞之機工有一千一百五十四人，戰爭結束後，亟待遣返，其返回原居地之入境手續，經本部與有關當局一再交涉，已允辦理，聯總行總亦允儘先協助遣送，我政府並已發給被遣返之機工，每人美金二百元，以資鼓勵。</p>

<p>何司長談話</p>
<p>何氏首對最近發生之巴眼亞比事件，詳加分析，繼表示我所取態度，其原則爲（一）對荷蘭與印尼衝突力守中立，並常勸諭舉僑不參與雙方糾紛。（二）在荷印華僑生命財產之　護，應田荷政府及印尼當局雙方切實負責。（三）荷政府當仍爲我外交之正式對象。（四）我對任何民族爭取其獨立與自由，固無不同情，惟在此種民族爭取獨立期間，如有損害我國當地僑胞生命財產之行爲，自失我一切之同情。（五）對荷蘭與印尼衝突，我方希　雙方能早獲合理解決。</p>
<p>李専使談話</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕最近行政院通過中國政府與聯　間關於船隻之補充協定，若千人士對於該項補充協定之內容未　明瞭，記者特定訪行總發言人，探詢眞相，承吿：「最近政院通過之關於船隻之補充協定，係規定聯總以船隻供給我國之若干條件，與前此遠東區　委員會通過之外籍船航行我國內河一案，爲截然兩事，毫無關聯，此項補充協定之主要內容爲：（一）聯總供給中國之船隻，一律懸掛中國國旗航行；（二）該項船隻借與中國使用，中國政府不出任何代價；（三）使用期間船隻如有損害，聯總不要任何賠債；（四）使用期間該項船隻如與第三者發生爭執，由中國政府負責處理，聯總不負責任；。借用期間中國政府得直接經營或委託航商經營；（六）期滿後可續借？（七）借用期內不得載運軍隊或軍用品。綜觀上述各項條欵，可知此項補充協定之訂立，中國可不出任何代價而獲得若干船之使用，本署現正與國內船商妥議委託代營之條欵中。上述關於船隻之補充協定，係根據一九四五年聯總與中國政府簽訂之基本協定第一條甲款之原則，即：「　總所供物資，倘爲若干　長期使用之設備，得與中國政府另訂補充協定，保留其所有權，而於本協定有效期間，將該項設備供給中國政府使用。」過去聯　曾以鐵路機車及車輛供給我國，亦會訂立同樣之備用補充協定。至於前此聯　遠東區　委員會通過之允許外籍輪船航行我國內河載運救濟物資一案，業經我國代表蔣廷黻表示反對，雖經該委員會半數之通過，惟尙未得聯總中央委員會之核准，更未得中國政府之同意。該案在未得中國政府之同意以前，斷無實行之可能。若干人士以此項船隻補充協定與上次遠東區城委員會之議案混爲一談，未免昧於事實，蓋前者爲我國不出代價獲得船隻使用，與遠東區域委員會議案之意義完全不同」云。</p>
<p>發言人又謂：至於陳納德空運隊所以遲遲不能開航之原因，該發言人拒加說明，僅謂：陳納德空運隊係一獨立性質之組織，並不爲行總之一部，行總無代爲說明之義務。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>獻校祝壽的倡導</h3>
<p>我國政府於抗戰勝利之後，即宣佈建國時期「敎育第工」，足見政府對於敎育事業的重視。但一年以來國家多故，致使復員工作，未能依照預定計劃進行，眼前一片紛亂，建設未遑着手，即以列爲第一的敎育，也未能有所建樹。高等敎育專科敎育姑不必說，就以國民敎貨而言，文盲還是　地。在抗　期間，敎育機關備受敵人的摧殘，不得不隨政府內遷。後方　校設備的簡陋，較戰前爲允甚；一旦勝利，匆匆復員，又因交通工具的缺乏，員生東遷，固非易事，而校　的遷回原址。更感極大的困難。何况原來校址，大半被敵人破壞，不堪　用，重加修建，需資甚鉅。所以勝利後一年來，各地敎育常局僅能顧及敎育復員，對於增設國民學校以普及敎育的一項計　，實無力兼　。因此之故，大量的兒童，被摒棄於國民學校的門外，不能享受義務敎育的權利。敎育常局非不知此爲可恥的現象，但每以格於經濟，不能作「無米之炊」，也只好束手不管，得過且過。一般敎育文化界的人士，莫不以此爲我國敎育當前的危機。</p>
<p>「十年樹木，百年樹人」，敎育　爲國家的百年大計。所以蔣主席一再吿誡國人，以「敎育第一」爲言。試想今後的中國，在政治上必求民主化，在經濟上必期工業化，在軍事方面必須現代化。欲實現此三大目的，則普及敎育，尤爲其刻不容緩的先決條件。民主政治向以普選爲基礎，而普　的澈底與否，尤爲測騐民主政治的尺度。時至今日，有資格投票選舉的公民，不但要明瞭切身的利害關係，而且還要洞悉國內外的情勢·如果沒有完全小學畢業的程度，怎樣能希望他不投錯票？以言經濟工業化，軍隊現代化，如果一個工人，一個農夫，一個士兵，沒有國民學校畢業的程度，又怎樣希望他能成一個健全的工人，一個能使用機械的農夫，一個能使用新式軍器的士兵？</p>
<p>上海市參　會日前開會，討論有關敎育的方案時，一般參議員曾爲國民敎育，大聲疾呼，主張市敎育局應權衡　重綏　，先集中全力，普及國民敎育，而暫置其他粧飾點綴之事於綏圖，可謂能見其大。我們以爲普及敎育，有關建國大計，及大多數人民的利益，不僅上海一市之事，尤吩全國上下，共下決心，在最短期間，完成此一大任務。本年蔣主席六秩誕辰，　瞬即届。主席旣領導革命北伐於先，又領導抗戰國於後</p>
<h3>滬市參議會代表晉京請願</h3>
<p>現在經濟上的通病，簡單地說起來，就有於一個「高」字。拆息太高，工繳太高，水脚太高，捐稅太高，物價太高，和　鈔額太高，　是大家公認的事實。</p>
<p>怎樣扌能削高就低，挽救經濟上的危機呢？對於這個問題，要從標本兩方面研究。從根本上解決，自然要把發行額加以節制，加以收縮，然後物價·捐稅·成本等等，扌能連　减低。不過此事與政治有密切關係，倘使政治上的痛，無法痛快地割去，那麽，要求通貨緊縮，法幣回籠，恐怕都是緣木求魚。</p>
<p>治標的辦決，方案很多。前次上海工商請願團所建議的，和這次上海市參議會請願團所帶去的，就大體論，都是切中時，豐功偉績，在我國近代史上，永垂不朽。凡我國人，欣逢良辰，誰不願爲其奉觴祝嘏？但在建國期間，艱難困苦，倍於戰時，全國上下，允應節衣縮食，埋頭建國工作，不能有一絲一　的退　，抑且主席平時　　，素　　約，更不容吾人多所違背。上海敎育文化界若十人士最近發起「獻校祝壽」的辦法，南京漢口等地，且已紛紛響應。此舉用意，一方面爲主席六秩祝嘏，另一方面又爲普及敎育，開　一條新的途徑，一舉兩得，我們在原則上完全贊同，允盼國人羣起響應，自動獻金，俾能至少　到一鎭一校或一區一校的目的。果能全國風行，即十年而後，蔣主席七秩大慶時，受　校祝壽運之　益的失學兒童，何止千百萬人？這是我們的新生代，國家未來的主人翁，也是我們希望所寄托的地方。國家社會對於這些新生代，都負有保他們享受敎育機會的義務。就是在主席本人，對於這個普及敎育的稅籌辦法，也當可期其默許，樂觀厥成的。弊之談。我們這裏還要向參議會各位代表進　的，倒不在增加辦法，而在乎懇切陳詞，喚起當局的眞切了解，勿　拿一套門面話，敷衍應酬一番了事。</p>
<p>國父說過：知　行易，這話，眞是不錯。任何難題，只須眞正了解，總不患無辦法，無力量。過去八年抗戰，終於得到最後勝利，就從朝野上下眞正了解中得來。我們不信，如果政府眞正了解人民的痛苦，工商的危機，而竟會一籌莫展，想不出解救的辦法來的。</p>
<p>目前的經濟危機，如果說，當局　沒有了解，那未免厚誣了人。我們相　這次代表的請求，一定可以得到當局的同情，接受，考慮，硏究，乃至分別設法辦理，這是毫無疑問的。問題只是在於：同情到甚麽程度？接受了怎樣處置？考慮和研究後又有其麽結果？設法辨理，是否止於設法？辦理是否能認眞和澈底？這些就不能無疑問了。</p>
<p>拿事實來說：我們　物價這一端罷。無論中央政府，或是地方政府，那一位常局，不在高呼抑平物價？那一個主管機關又不在奉行抑平物價這政策？無奈一面儘管抑平，一面儘管高漲，好像你平你的，我漲我的，儘可以並行不悖，各行其是似的。如果間問他們，一定可以得到這樣答覆：「沒有完　的辦法。」辦法沒有完　是眞的，但是竭智　能，而至今仍想不出完善辦法，　怕未必眞確罷！</p>
<p>我們仔細究，覺得這種不澈底的能度，　其說是辦理困難，還不如說是認識不足，執着太深。因爲認識不足，所以遇事以知敷衍，只圖點綴，而極其弊則終以　飾耳目爲能事。因爲執着太深，所以先人爲主，固執己見，心胸旣有所偏，更何能容人議論，極其弊則　於剛愎自用。結果是任何政策，都弄得不上不下，而此不上不下政策，又自以爲敷衍塗佈恰　好處，無論如何，不肯有所修正，更談不到改　易　。上海市參議會　願代表今晨在京，將向最高當局及各主管長官有所陳述，我　認爲他們不祇代表市參義會，更不祇代表工商界，實在是代表全上海四百五十萬市民，而他們所陳述的意見，也許就是全國國民的願望。因此，我們面希望當局重視他們的呼籲，而另一面更希望請願代表盡他們最大的努力，喚起當局對於當前經濟危機的眞切了解。「能知必能行！」這是國父的遺敎。當局如果眞正知道了危機迫在眉睫，　　有不能採行解救危機的辦法之理？</p>

<h3>紐論堡法庭宣讀刊决書　納粹戰犯今日定讞　至少有十三人將處死刑　七機構中四個單位無罪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎三十日廣播紐倫堡訊：給納粹廿一名首要戰犯所犯罪行各有輕重，各人所應得之刑將於明日一同宣判，届時將由國際軍事法庭庭長英代表勞倫斯勛爵單獨宣布。各被告將依次單獨入庭，聆取判決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐倫堡三十日電〕德國戰犯廿一名將於本日宣判，紐倫堡全城戒備森嚴，如臨大敵。鐵甲軍與輕坦克車通過中世紀之街值上，輪　轔轔，打破古世界之沉寂，充滿一片緊張空氣。德國社黨運動發跡於此，國社黨領袖之命運亦將永遠葬送於此。德人目擊此情，爲之黯然。國際法庭今日最後開庭，禁衛更嚴，憲兵滿佈，警察在街道搜檢行人與軍輛，閑人非有特別入場說，不得進入法庭旁聽，僅可自擴意機中聽取判決書之宣讀。各犯將分別宣判，並准其向柏林四國管制德國委員會請求寬恕。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十日廣播：審訊納粹戰犯亡國際軍事法庭，今日經由其審判長英代表勞倫斯爵士開始宣讀洋洋數萬言之判決書，該項判決書宣判納粹政權有罪，並指出該政權所犯之戰罪爲有史以來所未見者。各戰犯所犯之罪，爲對歐洲被侵略人民實施有系統之暴力及恐怖統治。但法庭裁定德方高級指揮部，參謀部，德內閣及衝鋒隊並非犯罪之機構單位。禁衛軍。特務隊。及秘密警察則爲有罪之團體。怯庭謂自一九三四年之清黨運動後，衝鋒隊已成爲「比較的不重要」，雖衝鋒隊內有若干黨員亦曾參加戰犯行爲及有背人這之行爲，但不得遽即認爲其一般黨員均曾參加或知悉犯罪行爲。據最有經騐之觀察家稱：納粹主要戰犯廿一人中，至少有十三人處死刑，認爲沙赫特，杜尼資等可免一死，而赫斯則可獲特殊之處置。</p>
<p>紐倫堡法庭審納粹戰犯之情形　（聯合社攝）</p>
<p>判决書內容一斑</p>
<p>〔路透社紐倫堡三十日電〕國際戰犯法庭於今晨十時（上海時間下午五時零四分）開庭，由庭長勞倫斯法官宣讀判決書。廿一被告中首先入庭者爲社尼資及雷特，納粹青年運動領袖許拉赫繼之，再次爲猶太劊子手史特萊徹，金融首領芬克及沙赫特，再次爲羅森堡，弗利克，牛賴特，弗利樞，戈林，赫斯及里賓特洛甫等。勞倫斯庭長首先略述一九四三年八月六日英美法蘇四國所訂之協定及規章，對法庭之組成管轄及任務等加以解釋。繼乃課轟審判經過，如已往開磨四〇三次之日期及情况等。繼又述及侵略戰之問題及與該間題有關之法律，指出本法庭受四國協定之束縛。該一規章，乃接受德國找降諸國合法行使主權立法權限之結果，法庭於研究納粹黨之計劃後，認爲大德國境內德人要求統一之志願，對於引起侵略奧國及捷克之行動，有大部份之藺係。凡爾賽和約之廢止，乃企圖證明德政府政策爲合理之重要動機。土地之要求，乃犧牲他國以取得生存空間之藉口。驅逐猶太人出於德國種族以外，爲造成殘害猶太族之直因。設立國軍之要求，結果乃形成最大規模之重整軍備。</p>
<p>勞倫斯庭長繼稱，各被告所得要求者，乃爲依據法理及就事實獲取公正之審判。各被告之主要聲辯理由，乃爲：在所謂犯罪行爲之賓行時間，並無一國己發動侵略戰，且侵略戰之定義旣無法律爲之規定，復無處罰明文，而前此亦未見設立特種法庭，以審判並處罰此等罪犯者。因此，處罰侵略戰之罪犯，係爲行爲後之立法，殊與文明國之法律原則相違背云云。勞倫斯庭長縱稱，德國國會之縱火案，乃希特勒及其內閣用以停止憲法上自由保障規定之藉口。摧殘其他政黨，使用集中營，設立秘密警察及特務隊消滅政敵，减少各地方政府之權限等等行動，目的均在使政治大權，由德國政府獨攬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎三十日廣播紐倫堡訊：蘇聯首席法官尼基欽哥繼續宣讚有關屠殺猶人之部份。謂一年中納粹所殺之九萬人中，大部係猶太人，因基於納粹猶人皆不得爲德國血種之敎義，猶人乃遭此慘運，一九三八年起，猶人幾已全部逐出於德人社會之外。法庭旋開始宣讀納粹七重要機構之罪行部份，（一）指導機關納粹黨，（二）蓋世太保，（三）保安部，（四）衝突隊，（五）禁衛軍，（六）內閣，（七）高級參謀部暨最高統帥部。對四大佔領區，均照反納粹法律觀念公平處理。</p>
<p>〔太報訊〕巴黎三十日廣播紐倫堡訊：今日下午紐倫堡法庭開庭宣判，法官狄特爾宣讚證書部份，謂有關違反人道之戰犯罪行，所獲證據多不勝數。法庭對一九四四年三月京魯格爾所須蓋世太保處決逃亡俘虜之命令，特予提出。納粹暴徒以更惡劣之暴行加諸蘇聯戰俘之身，謂德人成立有組織之殺人中心地，在侵攻蘇境之前，即組成特別　子手團。僅在蘇聯南部一區之內，此種儈子手團之一，即曾解決九萬男婦老少之生命，其時方在作戰之初耳。關於經濟貶藝術品之掠奪，亦有甚多之證據。</p>
<p>美國助理法官派寇宣稱：希特勒曾在各國內徵用兩萬五千萬人爲德國工作，間接對納粹作戰經濟有利之工作人數，共達三萬五千萬人之多。蘇克爾曾稱，在德境工作之五百萬人中，出於自願者不足廿萬之數，而此等工人所處境遇尤其慘無人道。</p>
<p>又悉：下午三時坐許，赫斯以肚痛萍劇，先行離開被告欄。</p>
<p>法庭判決書理由部份認爲：沙赫特與巴本未曾參預犯罪之計劃，故可减輕被控之罪。法庭認爲廿二被告均曾預先料及集體計劃「戰罪」或「反人道罪行」之意見未能採用。</p>
<h3>屠殺猶太人六百萬　煽動日對盟國作戰</h3>

<h3>獄中戰犯羣相　納粹軍人視死如歸　李賓特洛甫最胆怯　赫斯終日研究命理</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐倫堡廿九日電〕國際戰犯法庭今日作宣判前之末次秘密會議。在各戰犯所住之監獄內，衛隊及憲兵已增爲一營及一連之衆，合計官兵約一千名。某官員謂：此等衛隊憲兵在嚴密監視戰犯，並保護彼等，不使有未獲准之賓客前來訪問，同時並嚴寗保護庭長勞倫斯動爵之安全。基督敎及天主敎教士今日竟　爲各被告祈疇，左法庭附近，有反鐵並嚴密戒備之房屋一座，內有認員書記等法庭職員約五十人，從事判決書之準備，比等秘記工作，係由志願而經批准之人担任，在宣判前，彼等當與外界完全隔絕。被告中至少已有兩人表示歡迎被判死刑，一爲猶太劊子手史特萊徽，告某獄吏稱：「我願一死，至少因此叮得安眼，不再有衛隊在室外終夜斷擾而擾不清夢矣。」希特勒之經濟顧問芬克亦謂：「死猶較今日之活受」罪爲佳。」迷信的赫斯終日在室內研究命理學，並發表預言稱：「當判決時必能出現神蹟」，自開審以來，赫斯最爲樂觀，當開庭僅一星期時，渠曾告某心理學家云：「死刑固不可免，但納粹正義決不因廿位領袖之死亡而隨之死亡。」戈林·季台爾·郁特爾·杜尼資·賴特等自命爲軍人之人，均有視死如歸之表示，其中除郁特爾及賴特外，均已請律師向盟國管制委會聲請，若果判決死刑，請執行槍斃。納粹銀行家沙赫特至今仍稱法庭無對其判刑之權，牛賴特則自信訂獲徒刑，李賓特洛甫最爲胆怯，不敢談及判決。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕此間外交界負責人士今日宣稱，英美兩國可望迅即磋商韃朝尼爾海峽問題，再度堅持土耳其後盾。此乃史達林本月十四日發表談話以來國際爭執中最重要之發展，但尚無任何顯著跡象，證明列強間根太關係之惡化。國務卿貝爾納斯已在巴黎與英外相貝文初步交換意見。此間所得而知者，即英美將堅決反對蘇聯在韃　尼爾海峽　張軍事勢力，並反對蘇聯與土耳其直擴談判。美官塲認爲此新蘇土兩國直接交涉，等於將土耳其聽任蘇聯爲所欲爲，而無抗拒蘇聯要求之機會。</p>

<p>吳市長邀集各業談　檢討抑平物價問題　棉布毛絨造成奇貨可居現象　决定組織價格審議委會　　〔本報訊〕吳市長因鑒於最近物價波動頗劇，特於昨日下午四時，邀請本市各同業公會理監事代表舉行會談，計到地方協會會長杜月笙，米號業瞿振華，煤業公會謝蘅總，糖業公會鄭翊同，雜糧油餅業傅昌裕，呢絨業童斐揚，中紡公司吳味經，粉麩業顯竹年，人造絲業斐元崧，經售米糧業査責三，北貨業裘明琛，南貨業虞品如，蔬菜業張守仁，毛紡織業楊立人，紗商周家聲，鮮肉業朱志高，熟水業韓涇泉，棉布業董久暉，百貨業張文魁，金業詹建生，新藥業史致當，敵偽產業處理局劉攻芸，經濟部燃業管理委員會徐樂天等，由吳市長主席，略稱：今天召集各位開會的原因，是因爲最近市上物價多有變動，所以希望各同業公會代表能够正確檢討，如何使其趨於平衡。特別應該指出，作爲民食之主的米價，現時並未上漲。麵粉業亦曾規定其價格爲每担一萬四千元，現在已漲至一萬七千元，當局正設法抑平中。食油一項，政府可直接配給，本市所需總數之百分之七十，更無漲價之可能。所以近日來，最威脅民生之大餅油條漲上了一倍，實在沒有理由，必須設法取締，以安定民生。次之，最近布匹與棉紗亦上漲，此與平民生活有直接影響，要注意配給時其中有無舞弊或分配不勻之現象。又蔬菜業每屆中市黨部新主委　方治今晨就職　　新任市黨部主任委員方治，定今日正式就職，屆時將與吳前主委紹澍舉行交替儀式，並請監察委員兼政協會副秘書長雷震氏監誓。又前主委吳紹澍定今日午間在巨潑萊斯路私邸設宴歡迎方主委，潘公展，洪蘭友，雷震，端木愷，吳開先，陳石泉，兪松筠，趙棣華，吳任滄，陳寳驊諸氏被邀請作陪。　　市黨部舉辦堂務幹部人員訓練班，昨日結束，卒業式與紀念週，昨晨在市黨部禮堂同時舉行，由吳主委親自主持，臨別致詞，詞畢頒發獎狀與結業證書。　　市黨部曁卅二單位區黨部及直屬區書記委員以上工作同志五百餘人，定今晚假康樂酒家設讌歡送前主委吳紹澍，並迎新主委方治。　　午晚兩處歡宴迎送柯克將軍闡明美軍　招待記者在華任務　　〔本報訊〕美第七艦隊司令柯克海軍上將夫婦，前日由靑島來滬，定今日返靑。柯克上將昨日下午二時半在華懋飯店招待本市記者。柯克上將特再度申述美軍在華之任務，乃協助中國完成其受降工作如遣送日軍，協助中國在八年餘艱苦抗戰後之建設工作等。此純係一過渡時期。余等之目的全係希望帮助中國在國際地位上造成一强國。現在北平成立之軍調部執行小組亦任務中之一大工作。美軍在天津至秦皇島鐵路綫間設有護路隊，維持交通，並傳遞上海南京等地間電訊等工作。但此項工作時能發生困難，著等時在念中。　　繼由柯克上將答覆若干書面詢問，美海軍至今協助中國運輸之軍隊，共在二十五萬左右。最後一次輸送中國軍隊係在六月，本年一月間亦曾協助運輸共軍由香港廣州至烟合等地。　　美海軍陸戰隊在靑島及秦皇島裁縮及復員者的有二師，目前陸戰隊主要任務在維持軍調部執行小組之運輸及訓練中國海軍。受訓之中國海軍數字時有更動，共計的五百四十五人。現訓練課程全係基本者，如機械，無綫電，測量等術。美海軍所贈船艦不僅全歸中國海軍，此外聯總中國各輪船公司及江海關均有。在美國米亞米受訓之中國海軍學生的一千人，此次歸來者所駛　有航空母艦護航艦二艘，驅逐艦二艘。美贈予中國海軍之艦隻計有中型登陸艇四艘，陸軍登陸艇五艘，水陸兩用坦克車七艘，小艇三十艘。交與中國船商者計登陸艇五艘，中型登陸艇十五艘，小型登陸艇八艘，港口輔助艇五艘。聯總亦獲有中型登陸艇十六艘，登陸艇二十艘，驅遂艇五艘，小船一百二十三艘。尙有給海關者掃雷艇八艘，小型掃雷艇六艘，陸軍登陸艇二艘，及其他船隻約二十艘。　　最後柯克上將聲稱：美海軍艦艇將陸續遷撤至靑島或返美，但靑島「並非美海軍基地」，第七艦隊之旗艦，則將留駐靑島。秋節總有一陣漲風，但往年來過九月後便均回跌，然今年選而不跌，自屬例外。此外煤業方面，向由中央燃料管理委員會配給，官價未漲，爲何黑市高漲？市府本可採取適當措置，平定物價。但在有簡捷途徑可循之時，尙不擬施用壓力。希望各同業公會能自動協助政府，不增加施政困難。今日的會議，是座談會性質，希望知道各業漲價的理由，共同檢討，以謀解決。　　麺粉　　麵粉業同業公會理事長顧竹年申述其漲價之理由稱：同業公會中，能配到麵粉者計七十餘家，再配與一百餘家小型店，其中配到最多者爲五六十包，最少者爲二三十包，而每月銷量爲一萬五六千包，所以實際上不够供應市面。又政府曾有免稅一年辦法，現免稅期限至九月期滿，即日起即將征收營業稅千分之十五。又最近運輸費增漲，故將來麵粉之價格，似難有穩定把握。吳市長當即答以營業稅爲中央決定，地方不能任意調動，然市府自當設法使其　免。　　煤業　　　由煤業圖業公會理事長　　　稱：欲抑平煤價，非暢通來源不可，現本市烟煤均由行政院燃料管理委員會分配，全市煤業公會每月僅配得五千噸，實在不够分配，要抑平黑市，必須暢通來源，現在問題不在乎無煤而是在乎無船。希望政府配給船隻，到開濼。海防等地去裝煤。煤業同業公會已限制各同業之合法利潤不得超過百分之二十·行政院燃料管理委員會代表稱：最近燃料飛漲，而烟煤未漲，烟煤是由該處配給的，還是維持以前的價格。又煤球的原料不漲，所以煤球在今天並未漲價，該委員會每月煤之總數爲二十萬噸，而本市公用事業，如電力公司·煤氣公司·自來水公司等所用煤量的爲四五萬噸，已佔其總數四分之一，且漢口，南京，九江，靑島等地之煤，亦須由上海分撥，故該委員會亦實感入不敷出之苦。現政府已竭力疏通來源，經常有船隻往各地採辦。　　布業　　布業同業公會代表則稱目前布價上漲之二大原因爲：（一）有貨不足，戰前本市棉布存貨有一千萬疋，後經日敵全數收買。（二）時令届秋，市民需布殷切，鄉下人因生活較安定，羣起購布，且最近遝往東北者有六十萬疋，產量不足，故布價之漲實係被動的，公會已一再設法謀求抑平。毛絨綫業司業公會代表則謂由於謠傳影響，最近市上盛傳外匯又將調整，且天時漸寒，市民購買踴躍，而來源少，因此供不應求，造成奇貨可居現象。各同業公會紛紛大嘆苦境後。杜月笙發表意見　　杜月笙起稱：吳市長自接任後，量關心者爲本市之物價，但眞正與市民有切身關係者爲米，油，煤，布，糖等日常必需品，只要這幾件主要物品不漲，則與民生無嚴重之影響，所以市長之抑平物價，可以此爲原則。市長當即表示對杜氏意見極表贊同，並稱現時市府與各公會負責人已有經常之連絡，可保證其不漲價，唯市畏認爲棉布業，煤業，毛絨業等對市民亦有直接之影響，故決定由肚會局興各該同業公會代表組織價格審　委員會，務使各業步入正軌，切勿有越軌之行動，而　使當局加以取締。末由西藥業同業公會代表史致富報吿該業之現况後，大會至六時餘始數。十四團體園遊酒會　今日招待美軍眷屬　　〔本報訊〕上海市參議會，上海市地方協會，上海市新聞記者公會，市敎育會，市律師公會，市商會，市銀行公會，市工業協會，市總工會，市錢業公會，市日報公會，市會計師公會，市農會，市第六區棉紡業公會等十四團體，將於今日下午四時至六時，在麗都花園舉行園遊酒會，招待美軍眷屬。前日本麥酒會社　孔祥熙進行收買　　〔本報訊〕前由日人在虹口設立之「大日本麥酒株式會社」，由敵僞產業處　局標賣與「中美汽水公司」，因　　之地皮係孔祥熙氏所有，發生爭執，慘　員曾在參議會中提出質詢。唯處理局所標賣者僅係該廠之生財設備，並不包括地皮在內。孔氏不願將該處地皮租與中美汽水公司，而欲收買該廠，中美當局已允出讓。關於價格方面，目前尙未談妥。財政局長谷春帆　談徵收各項捐稅　增加娛樂捐勢在必行　市政建設捐將延至下月開徵　　財政局局長谷春帆，昨對記者談稱：娛樂捐增加稅率至百分之五十，一俟參議會決定之正式通知書送到，即將實行，日前雖有娛樂界代表來本局請願，本人即吿以增加稅率，係由參議會決定，當時會塲中討論此案時，僅有一人表示反對，其餘參議員皆舉手贊成，故增加稅率，勢在必行，非向本局請願所能更改。記者詢以關於話劇娛樂捐，是否亦將與其他娛樂捐稅同樣增加，谷氏答謂：話劇捐稅目前仍爲百分之三十八，在前次加捐時，話劇捐亦未增加，如此次市參議會送交本局之正式通知書中，對話劇捐稅如無明白規定，則市財局或不擬考盧其是否應與電影院等同樣增加捐率。據谷氏估計，娛樂捐增加後，其稅額每月的可增至二十一億元，氏文謂：財政局對宴席捐起徵之數額原定爲一千元，現已考慮提高至二千元，在各飯店菜館，吃食二千元以下之客飯，概不徵捐，此項新規定經市政會議通過後，於日內亦即可實行。關於市政建設捐之徵收，財局已規定捐稅計算及徵收辦法，於一二日內即將開始向全市住戶調査每一幢房屋之實際租金，以確定房東應負担繳納房捐之確數，財局將按此數額與市政建設捐併向房客徵收後，再由房客以之抵扣租金云云。　　市建設捐計算辦法　　記者爲明瞭市政建設捐之徵收計算辦法，又往訪該局房捐科科長何嘉裕氏，據談：本市房屋，曾經前公共租界工部局及法公董局，於民國二十六年間絡續估定其租値。茲以九年以來，物價高漲，經將全市房屋分爲三等，照廿六年租値分別增加若干倍，作爲秋季房捐之總額如下：甲等房屋廿六年估定年租値一千八百元以上者，照估租一百倍，乙等房屋廿六年估定年租値一千元以上，不滿一千八百元者，七十五倍，丙等房尾廿六年估定年租不滿一千元者五十倍例如戰前月租二十五元，年租三百元之房屋（兩等），秋季應收捐額共爲一萬五千元（即三百乘五十倍），但此爲秋季房捐及市政建設捐兩項合併之總額。分別計算，則房捐應爲實收房租之二成，應由房主負担，其餘數爲市致建設　，由住戶負担，例如上述臘前年租三百元之房屋，目動實際租金爲每月一萬元，則房主每月應付房捐二成，（即二千元），每季應付房捐六千元，其秋季　捐爲一萬五千元，　除　　應付之房捐六千元之後，其餘九千元即爲住戶本季負担之市政建　捐，於此可知市政建設捐之多少，與房捐爲反比例，房租愈大，房捐愈高，即住戶所付之市政建設捐愈少。　　調查租金確定數額　　至於冬季房捐及市政建設捐之總額，則按照秋季再加一倍計算，但其中房捐部份，則仍按貽實際祖金微百分之二十，本局於本週內即將開始向全市居戶調査其所住房屋之實付租金，已印就調查表格，限期於十月廿日以前塡就郵寄本局，俾以確定房主應徵房捐之數額。如一處房屋中居住多數住戶，則此項表格，應由轉租之二房東塡報大房東所收之租金，三房客可不必塡寄。將來開徵時，市政建設捐及房捐即併爲一單，稱爲「市政建設捐房捐繳款書」，此項捐稅，將全部先由房客繳付，而在其付與房主之租金中扣還。至市政建設捐之開徵，以調査及準備手費時，且南市閘北房屋之估値工作，尙未辦竣，故其開徵期將延至十一月中旬。據估計市政建設捐秋冬兩季之總共收入，約有二百億元左右。古鏡翠玉原璧歸趙　西愛咸司路巨竊案破獲　　二十一日侵長二時許，西愛咸司路六二七號梁藏生住宅，失竊名貴玉盂銅鏡等，經報市警察總局査緝在案。昨日上午經蓬萊路警分局員警在徐家匯馬家宅十三號緝獲主犯王連保夫婦及其弟王長根，搜獲　物無綫電打字機等。又往平濟里路一八三號王阿巧家，搜獲翡翠玉屏風兩座，翡翠玉盂一事，翡翠花瓶一只，古銅鏡一面，常將各該人犯一併帶局偵訊，贓物交原主領回。空軍供應司令　到滬就職視事　　空軍總司令部供應司令部係統轄全空軍供應事宜之機構，業在武進路海南路前空軍第三地區司令部原址部署就緒，供應司令王衛民上校，已於前日蒞滬到部視事。港務整理會成立　各組人選已確定　　上海港務整理委員會，將於今日正式成立，關於該會人事，據悉：除主委由吳市長兼任外，主任秘書將由現任市府接收物資管理處處長謝灝齡担任，秘書組組長亦由謝氏兼任，視察組組長黃佑南，海事組組長袁晋，碼頭倉庫組組長胡匯泉。尙有警務等兩組人選，未經發表。得利小開　爲妻所窘　　〔本報訊〕南京路亨得利鐘錶行大明眼鏡公同主人寗波人莊鴻皋，四十八歲，住北京西路福田邨四十七號，納一妾，則居於福煦路明德里五十三號，莊有子名志國，年輕倜儻，時出入於歌台舞榭。民國廿九年二月間，在新都飯店與劉　玲（廿四歲）正式結婚，同居於呂班路二號培恩公寓三十五號房間。婚後五年，劉女已育三女，長名碧如，次碧蟬，幼碧婷；惟夫婦間感情冷淡，年前志國在大都會舞廳結識舞女董愛媛（即鄭淼雲），賃屋靜安寺路大華公寓，旋爲劉所偵悉，曾於去年十二月間實行捉姦，常將董及其夫志

<p>今日起停供電熱　禁用戶外霓虹燈　解救目前電力荒實行臨時辦法　電價將按月自動調整　　〔本報訊〕據公用局長趙會珏稱：自今日起，本市商店所有戶外之霓虹燈及廣吿性之電燈牌　，一律禁止使用。唯戶內使用之霓虹燈，不在禁止之列。關於電熱（Space　Heating），除各醫院中所必須應用者外，亦於今日起，一律停止供給。家用電社（Eletric　Cooking），每戶每月限用五百度。電氣冰箱限用一百二十度。皆足敷正常需用。此係解救目前電力荒之臨時辦法，一旦電力稍充裕時，即當逐漸放寬限度。　　〔又訊〕爲求解救目前之電力荒，公用局正協助華商及浦東電氣公司，採購二千　之小型發電機器，此係爭取時間之治標辦法。因囊救濟總署已運到此種小型機器，該署須統籌分配，公用局方面正力爭儘先配售上海方面，因上海之電力，主要係供給工業應用，電力不足，影響生產甚大。目前市價，小型發電機每　約一百三十餘元美金。關於閘北水電公司，有斯可逹發電機兩套，公用局正責令該公司趕修備用。　又據上海電力公司負責人稱：該公司已呈請市政府核准調整電價。此次所呈請之辦法，係根據發電成本之三大要素：煤價，生活指數，外幣匯兌率而定。一旦批准之後，本市電價，即依此三大要素之變動，而按月自動調整。據稱：自去年九月十七日接收以後，至本年八月底止，上海電力公司已虧折四十一億元。自九月份起，每月虧折增至十二億元。目前電燈價每度七十三元，戰前爲一角八分，計增百倍。電力價每度八十四元，戰前爲五分，計增一千六百餘倍。據傳新價目或將於十一月初批准。「三朝元老」夏奇峰終身監禁　曾廣炎科刑六年不甘服　朱博泉有功判徒刑二年　　〔本報訊〕高院特刑庭昨判數案：（一）「三朝元老」夏奇峰，判處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。被吿衣藍綢袍，足穿黑布鞋。聞判黯然無語。按夏現年五十九歲，江蘇泰縣人。歷任僞南京維新政府內政部决長，外交部長，僞華北臨時政府之聯合委員會事務部政務處處長，及汪逆之僞國民政府審計部長兼中央執行委員等職。（二）歷任偽浙江省建設廳長·敎育應長·僞淮海省行政督察專員及敎育廳長等職之曾廣炎，處有期徒刑六年，褫奪公權六年。被吿聞判稱：絕對不服，將申請覆判。（三）敵憲兵隊翻譯林志興，通謀敵國，充任有關軍事職役，處有期徒刑三年，褫奪公權三年。（四）徐森甫被控漢奸嫌疑案，調査之下，罪證不足，宣告無罪。　　又朱博泉，昨亦同時判決。審判長稱因被吿維持上海金融有功，僞職任內，並無多大不利於國家及人民之行爲，故判處有期徒刑二年，褫奪公權二年，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。被吿聞判面露笑容。按朱戰前曾任中央銀行稽核及業務局總經理等職。太平洋戰起，留滬期間，任僞中國實業銀行董事長，僞交通銀行董事，僞上海諮詢委員會委員，僞中央儲備銀行參事等職。范永增陳祖建　均定五日宣判　　〔又訊〕范永增，上海人，現年五十九歲。留學美國麻省理工大學，得工程碩士學位。回國後，曾擔任交通大學·河海工程專門學校敎授。民國廿六年時猶服務於本市地政局，任科長職。「八一三」戰起，上海淪陷，於廿七年五月出任僞上海市地政局長，直至勝利爲止、經軍事機關逮捕，移送高檢處偵査起訴，由高院數度審訊，昨日上午開辯論庭。橡察官論吿稱；被吿所任僞職，經辦之業務爲調換土地證，土地移轉登記及發給承租契等項，均按土地價値，從中抽收費用，並曾代敵恒產公司以低價強購民地五千餘畝，又代敵海陸軍僅發小額補償金，强佔圈定民地數千畝，爲建築飛機塲及軍事基地之用。綜其所爲，顯屬通敵叛國無疑，應請依法懲治。被吿辯稱：出任僞職，係因數度被敵僞綁架威逼，不得已而始就。圈地强購等事，係敵軍所爲，在其勢力控制之下，非地政局所可阻梗云。其辯護律師亦請庭上鑒諒被吿當時之處境，予以從輕處斷。最後審判長宣佈辯論終結，定十月五日上午九時宣判。　　又陳祖建被控資敵，昨日審結，亦定十月五日宣判。提訊三犯　　同日調査多起：（一）陳克明，被控曾任僞軍突擊隊副班長，被吿昨在庭上吾認，並稱：前於卅一年五月加入忠救軍蘇常行動總隊爲隊員，派在陷區活動。卅一年十月，在宜興附近爲新四軍包圍俘虜，後仍逃出，因與原部隊失却聯絡，乃加入江蘇省保安第九旅第一團第一營爲兵士。勝利後，調駐常州，後逢整編，乃退出而入京滬區鐵路管理局戚墅堰機廠充任便衣警，故從未充任任何僞職云。（二）湯耀良，被控曾任僞松江政治保　局密探及敵駐松江卅一號洋　部隊密探。被吿供稱，業木匠，一向做棺材。從未做過漢奸。此次被人檢舉，起於私仇誣吿。因被吿之妻，於婚前曾與鄕長有染，旣婚，該鄕長乃見恨於心，設計陷害，今　亦不知去向云。庭上諭定下次開庭時，傳該鄕長到案。（三）黃鶴亭，在本市閘北大統路五十號設有協成米店，因曾任僞自治會閘北區第一鄕鄕長與敵合作，乃被檢舉。昨在庭上供稱，出任該職，係出於當地商民之推舉，以上三案均改期再訊。劉克章逃了累保人　　又劉克章漢奸據疑案，前因情節較輕，高院特准交保出外。奈劉竟乘機潛匿無踪，高院昨特傳保證人張良泰到院，限於三星期內將被吿尋獲。下次十月二十日上午九時開庭時，偕被吿一同到案，否則將依法辦理。　　〔又訊〕陳世金，林憶志兩人，經高檢處偵訊結果，以有漢奸嫌疑，茲經提起公訴。劃一懸旗失原樣　雙十節前須修正　　〔本報訊〕警察局明令劃一懸掛之國旗，業已飽經風雨，鈎桿旗幟多有走失原樣者，爲整飭市容起見，特令各分局，轉吿居民，限於雙十節前，白動修正，以壯觀瞻。屆時各局將派員赴各區巡視，如發現有不合標準者，將予懲處。清查團昨日結束　未了案件移交監察使署辦理　上章毛織廠案賬册尙未查明　　〔本報訊〕淸査團已於昨日結束矣！記者昨下午赴該團時，見團內人員正忙於整理文件，放置籐箱內。由市府等處調用之職員，紛紛向張團長知本，及各委員吿別。淸査團雖吿結束，各委員所經手辦理之未了案件，仍將繼續負責了結。至於需要覆査之案件，全部移交監察使署繼續辦理。原定昨日發表之淸査團工作報告，及經辦各案表格，因有數案未了，乃不得不暫緩發表。淸査團負責人稱：關於整個上海接收工作，勝利之初，係慶軍事時期，機關林立，情勢複雜，不免呈混亂現象。俟市府及警備司令部成立後，接收仍未上正軌，深以爲憾。敵僞產業處理局成立以後，因範圍太多，事情太繁，有無毛病，固然無人敢擔保，但敵僞物資之登記及管理？確已漸上規道，功不可沒。　　淸査團負責人，昨日上午赴經濟部辦公處調査「上章」毛織廠案。「上章」係章華毛織廠於淪陷時期，被敵方「上海毛織廠」强迫合併組織者，當時章華被迫簽訂合同，將全部生財設備，租借與「上章」。現章華已發還原主，唯「上章」時期敵人擴充部份，收歸國有，由經濟部估價十四億餘元，擬售於意華。雙方已談妥，唯尙未交割。密吿人稱：其中有舞弊情形，淸査團乃追究原始淸册，發覺經濟部蘇浙皖區特派員辦公處所接收上海敵營各工廠，雖有日人移交淸册，或日人會章之接交消册，唯各該工廠之財產目錄及原始簿據均未交出，故移交或接交淸册所列，是否與財產目錄及帳册記載相符，確有疑問。極而言之，經濟部所接收者，亦僅爲接收人員與日人寶際點檢交接之數目。至於敵警工廠究應交出之數量若干，非與原財產目錄及帳册核對，難明眞相。因之，淸査團對此項工作，以敵人不交出各廠財產目錄及帳籌，均無從着于辦理。現擬轉咨行政院迅飭各有關機關追査敵人在滬經營各工廠之財產目錄及原始帳册。以資核對。上述情形，實係淸査團對各接收工廠，不易澈底淸査之癥結所在。而日方最近交與中央之原始淸册，可能與移交或接交淸册，出入甚大。　　對於市政府物資接收管理處，淸查團方面認爲成立之初接收日僑小商店等物資，因缺乏成規，管理殊欠週寗，不免凌亂，前任責無可卸。外界雖嘖有煩言，該團並未接到正式密吿函。唯現任已積極整頓，該處事務已井然有序。至於當初有否隱匿，遺漏或損失，淸查團已送請處理局切實追查，嚴密辦理。　　據淸査團張委員慶楨稱：現被非法强佔之校址，有同濟，培德，中國公學，大公等校，正積極督促非法佔據機關遷讓云。東北需要技術員　公用局正代招考　　〔本報訊〕公用局，正代資源委員會招聘前往東北之技術人員，共需電機工程人才五十名，土木工程十名，凡國內外大學畢業，或有同等學力者，可至該局機械室報名。宣司令定期宴美眷　　〔本報訊〕警備司令宣鐵吾，定本月七日假紹興路警察俱樂部招待本市美軍眷屬，舉行盛大聯歡宴會。廠商店號聯合大贈送　九月份中選印花揭曉　　本報　各大廠商店號委託，自七月起舉行職合大贈送以來，情况熱烈與時俱增，昨爲九月份滿期之　，經　本報於下午四時，邀請廣吿代理商代表馮肇樑，　　　，胡克敏三君，隨帶保管　匙，蒞臨本館營業部，會回本報陳　經理，開箱啓封。密封中之日期爲「民國卅五年九月十二日」，即以該日爲中選日，凡持有該日本報所載「師」字印花者，均可領取贈品一份。至一切詳細辦法，可參閱今日本報巨幅廣吿。附圖左起爲陳總經理·馮　　·姚君偉。胡克敏。啓封後留影。變賣敵產繳庫欵項　逹二千三百卅餘億　　　蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局，對於接收之敵偽物資，加緊變賣，收入逐月增加。九月份收入計達三百七十億元，打破以前各月收款紀錄。該局截至八月底止，解繳國庫款項已達二千三百卅餘億元之鉅。　　〔又訊〕蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局，前奉院令，視業務情形，緊縮機構，樽節開支，經自今夏起絡續裁員。近以各項處理工作漸吿段落，又經決定先行資遣職員一百數十人似後仍將逐漸緊縮公務員中敗類　任意敲詐被捕　　〔本報訊〕中正路東新橋畔大滬飯店五樓五〇六號房間，於昨晨零時半，忽有　員多名闖人，將室內兩着西裝，一衣中山裝之男子帶走。同時搜出槍械一支。事後據悉，該三男子係本市某　關公務員，平時利用職務上便利，任意迭向有隱私之人敲詐，並向毒販燕子窠等處收取附規，爲數殊鉅，朋分化用，徵妓侑酒。事被茶分局偵悉，特派警員馳往逮捕，一俟偵　屬實，即由解司法機關究辦。大衆夜報被控　宣判無罪　　周起附逆嫌疑案　　檢舉人呈繳證件　　〔本報訊〕經大衆夜報向高檢處檢舉有附逆罪嫌之前僞華影演員周起，向地院自訴大衆夜報妨害名譽一案，昨地院再度開庭，辯論終結，當庭宣判被吿無罪。附帶民訴駁　。周起本八因病未到庭，委託律師代理出席。被吿胡漢君錢台生隨帶太平洋週報呈庭，證明周起於本市淪陷時期內，參加演出敵反英美協會所主辦之「江舟泣血記」及僞警局主辦之一回頭是岸」兩話劇，並拍攝「雪梅風柳」，「樂府烟雲」等含有毒素之電影。並稱以上諸證據，申報資料室皆有保存，必要時法院可調閱作證云。　　又大衆夜報當局檢舉周起附逆罪嫌案，高檢處已二度偵詢，並着檢舉人提補證據。聞昨日該報已搜集刋有周起於敵僞時期內所演毒性影片如「雪梅風柳」·「樂府烟雲」以及「江舟泣血記」·「回頭是岸」·「龍鳳花燭」等話劇有關文字之僞報，一併送繳高檢處。化妝品業大會　請緩征貨物稅　　市商會請緩香皂科稅　　本市化妝品工業同業公會，昨爲硏討新增貨物稅問題，假座金陵東路二五六號舉行會員首次大會。計到會員八十餘團體代表。主席胡伯翔報吿化妝品新增貨物，請求免征經過，並徵詢同業各廠商意見。各廠商痛陳化妝品工業尙在幼稚時期，殊非征收貨物稅之對象，抑且走私外貨充斥市塲，處境益形艱困，新增貨物稅，徒增國產廠商負担，加速崩潰云云。當經決議：（一）本案授權本會稅則硏究委員會辦理之。（二）由全體理監事於本月三十日前往上海貨物稅局面請暫緩開征，（三）公推理事長胡伯翔曁理事林汝康等五人，晋京向立院，政院，財部，經部等各有關當局請願，免予征稅。　　〔本報訊〕市商會頃准本市皂燭工業同業公會函陳理由三點，謂代呼籲緩征香皂貨物稅由，特電呈南京財經兩部，略稱；査香皂一項，現列入化妝品範圍之內，規定應納貨物稅從價征收百分之四十五。按照該業目前情形，大都小額資本，產量有限，不適合於征收出廠稅之客觀條件。就國家財政收入之目的而論，竊慮所得不償所失。就該業之環境而論，香皂價格目前遜於普通之洗衣皂，尙且無甚銷路。一且加價百分之四十五，更恐無人過問，影響該業前途。當此萬方多難，四民失業之時，能維持一業之存在，即减少一分失業之恐慌。所以惠養民生，培養國脈者，在彼不在此。擬請鈞都鑒核，准將該業貨物稅暫緩實施征收。俟工業形勢穩定，銷路暢通之後，屆時再行斟酌辦理。庶國稅商情，均能兼顧，曷勝企籌云。華社舉行成立會　　華社原爲抗戰以前由陳培德等

<p>當局傳詢狂漲原因　人造絲漲勢略定　紡建公司發表代理配售之經過　存貨發現七百箱尚未全數交出　　〔本報訊〕昨日人造絲始堅後疲，一二〇號天橋有光先喊五百五十萬元，最高六十五萬元，中間五十五萬元有成交，後回小做四十八萬元收盤，下午因有社會局　擬傳絲號業負責人査詢之說，人心漸虛，最後做三十萬元，結果與上週末價相仿，無甚上落，衹有一五〇號有光　要頗殷，抬高十萬元之譜，中國紡建公司業矜處處長蔣迪先氏，頃對該公司配售人造絲情形有所聲明。據語記者：公司主要業務，爲經營接收之紡織工廠。因敵僞產業局以接收之敵僞紗布若干倉庫托爲處理，其中有一部份人造絲，乃一併代爲出售，當時市價曾高達二百四十萬一箱，自公司配售降至一百一二十萬元，且保持不變，最爲平穏，此項人造絲存放已久，　蛀鼠咬，破缺甚多，均須整理。至八月底止，共得八千一百零五箱，自三月初每星期配售一次，凡登記之絲織廠及人造絲商號，均可請　，最初因絲廠减工，需要不大，凡申請者，悉數照售，惟國內旣無生產，接收之數，隨售隨减，若非向國外訂購，勢必有缺貨之一日，該公司會於六月間，將此種情形及應行未雨綢繆之處，詳陳當局，並根據絲織業意見，請向日本輸入，需要各稱條份一萬箱，最近二三月間屢屢　請，惟以輸入人絲，不屬該公司，故其進行情形，亦不深悉，九月初以接收之人絲代售將完，並以中信局旣在處理人絲，而對於輸入人絲，亦由中信局主持，特函處理局請對代銷人絲事作一結束，統歸中信局辦理。本月來續由處理局撥到人絲兩批，計三百餘箱，隨即提出整理，竭力維持每週開貨不使間斷，自外匯變動，而人絲售價，始終維持原價。並奉令照棉紗例，暫停商號之配售，以維生產。實以每週整好可售者，不及三百箱，每廠一包，已無多餘，明知一廠一箱無濟於事，然所存僅數百箱，只能　延殘喘，勉維現狀。故雖市價漲達二百卅萬，比脾價幾逾一倍，亦未提價，近又漲逾兩倍，同時紗布亦有調整，因商取局方同意，酌量提升，照市價七折發售，然較市價仍低百萬以上，該公司對人絲雖甚焦灼，亦徒喚奈何，上週五據絲織業方面告，有數倉存有人絲，隨派人査明有三處，共約七百箱，其中一處，已由局撥交。他處未提。兩處之提撥說，前會交紡　　取一部份，後又爲局收回，因即商請處理局提取，以便本週儘量供應，最近人絲暴漲，已純人投機局面，成交數量旣極微，實不能視爲芷常價格，惟向日輸入人絲總量，已運及已到到數量及將來處理辦法，均急待決定，庶足以消滅投機之風云。市府警局　查房真相　　據悉吳市長對人絲之上漲，已予以注意，昨晨手諭，傳公會理事長裴元鼎，於下午三時，前往面詢，又警察局經濟科，亦函公會詢問眞相。公債穩健　洋行幫有買賣　　公債有洋行界之買戶，前來吸收，統丙晨開一八五〇元，八　某戶買胃較健，洋行幫亦納，曾盤高至二二八〇元，始有零星之賣戶，陸續了結，曾吿回跌，退至一九四〇元，始轉穩健，臨收仍站定於二〇〇〇元，關外，結果較前收好起一七〇元，甲乙升五〇元，丁種好八〇元統戊微升三〇元，成交不下票面四百餘萬元。金鈔回　紗花幫結印匯　　烚赤昨又趨平穏，晨開二一六萬五，隔週多方微有了結，低至二一六萬，銀錢業餘資有所維持，頗爲穩健，上落有限，十時後央行配給六四條，便二一六萬五，十時後又趨微挺，會扳高至二一七萬五，遂引起壓力，央行有所管制，近午退至一二五萬四，午刻站定於二一六萬左右，午後現貨稍疲，後廣帮有進，隔日交割又升至二一七萬外，結果較前收微降九千，飾金掛低至念三萬元，紋銀平銀元續升，暗拆銀根見緊，自一角四分至一角八分不等。　　外幣甚爲穩健，美鈔晨初因失望之浮多，有所了結，四〇三〇元有售，低價不過三九八〇元，中涂微有結款，曾盤高至四〇五〇元，始隨金市吿回，午刻在四〇〇〇元關內外掙扎，午後平穏，並無特殊變化，結果較前收回小三十元，港幣因申電報縮，自七九〇元好至八一〇元左右，結果亦升二十元，港匯在八一〇元左右，頗有成交，印匯有紗花帮結進升至九八〇元外，英匯亦扳高至一三六〇〇元以上，美匯站牌價未有對做。上市之說頗盛　外股展開漲風　　外股參加證交上市之說又濃，買風復起，怡紗英聯會德　怡啤呼聲最高，漲勢較勁，中途頗爲掙扎，怡紗迫近萬元大關，英聯一一四〇〇元後，稍有回落，結果較上週六計鋼業怡紗漲一成左右，會德　英聯怡啤各好半成强，紙業業廣航業升而不多。棉紗易漲難跌　配售三千件價未動　布供不敷求扶搖直上　青島高檔染設法運申　　〔本報訊〕昨日紗市始疲終漲，晨初因報載利空傳說，一度　落五七萬，然買戶　集，一經下手搜買，甫跌之價，復又冉冉上升，津粤兩帮雖未動辦，然本埠織廠布廠不惜放價採辦，逢低便收，是以收盤時各價，又漲到上週末之價格，目趨勢較前尤爲堅挺。　　紗廠聯合配銷委員昨日下午第四次開紗計開售廿支棉紗標準數額二，〇四七·五件。又紡建公司開售一、二四九·五件。（紡建公司消息爲一二五五·五件）。均係按照申請額，酌折配售。售價以四百磅廿支標準，每件仍爲一百五十五萬元。下次開售日期，定於十月二日。　　昨布市晨開平平，與週末價無甚榮辱，僅六千號坯布價最　俐，竟高做十萬元外，尙屬准虛單現貨價格常在十一萬元光景矣，民營廠方面，開價不肯低落，而客路及本街續有走化，價格遂拉提不少。四君子　嘰現貨，仍站十萬零四千元，高檔士林坯布仍屬供不敷求，價站九萬外，而嘉豐坯布，高開九萬八千元，頃刻售罄，原以染廠需求坯布甚殷之故，聞紡建方面，深體此情，正與各該業負責人擬具實際　要數量，予以適常之供應，並聞譔靑島分公司之高檔染坯，亦正設法運出應各廠需要云。　　劉文勝晋京　商南運數量　　經濟部紡織事業管理委員會業務處處長劉文騰氏，頃爲向經濟部接洽要公，業於昨晚晋京。據語記者：此行將請示兩點，（一）紗布南運准許數額之確定及辦法。（二）擴大現有紗廠聯合配銷機構，加强配銷力量之具體辦法，劉氏預定今晚返滬云。各帮進胃不惡　華股漲面居多　　華股昨因人心趨俏，銀根縱感緊迫，但以一般擁有餘資者，若廣帮川帮以及銀行界都有吸納，縱有證券帮中人以及紗布帮號家，迫於銀根有所斬售，仍能趨高，然因買風不甚普遍，小股較爲失色，晨開已吿見昂，二三二號開後即力購美亞，川帮亦吸永紗，迨永紗升至七八〇元，美亞四六〇〇元後，稍吿疲怯，中途掙扎不已，永紗退低至七六八元，美亞自四六四〇元降至四五五〇元，信和自三三一元，退至三二二元，各小股更退至前收左右，後以川帮及銀行界再購美亞及信和，於是在十一時二十分後，形勢又吿堅俏，兩大熱及信和均再達高價。三小熱僅吿追隨而已，結果仍盤，較前收計永紗美亞升半成不到，三小熱衹吿小漲，次熱以信和最爲吃香，好起一成弱，中紡火柴公司榮豐微升，冷門中絲大通統益均有微升，五和景綸微挫，小股內衣吿平、新亞麗安水泥華與均有挫落，總成交額共爲一一七二萬股，塲外各股微挫者居多。廠經不甘示弱　昨跟漲二三十萬　商廠求自由出賣其存貨　　廠經近日來緊隨人絲之漲風，昨日前市頗形活躍，尤以干經最俏，價臻高峰，後市因人絲價略軟，隨之而平，不過價較上週末已高十餘萬元，至二三十萬元不等，其原因由於人造絲飛漲，絲廠商乃紛紛要求中　公司、轉向當局請求提高收買價格，及准廠商自由出賣，中　乃徇廠商之要求，轉向有關當局硑商結果，原則　上已得當局之接受，唯有關當局表示，因此次絲價上漲，乃非正當之現象，尤以外銷方面，並無甚活躍方是否能持久，殊有考慮之必要，故關於提高收買價格方面，須待絲價漲勢奠定以後，再作計議，至於由絲廠商自由出賣一節，亦應考慮，在應解中信局收買額中，准許自由售賣若干，至於　細辦法，尙須經三區同業公會申請後，再作最後之決定，綢貨昨亦猛晋，被面比上週六大廿萬元，盛杭各貨，亦均增高。出口貨展覽會　今日正式開幕　　本市進出口業商業公會等機關所聯合主辦之中國出口貨展覽會，業經長時期之籌備，最近已吿就緒，定今日起在八仙橋靑年會公開展覽，是項展覽會中陳列出口貨品，計有絲綢，桐油，猪鬃等百餘種之多，展覽會期間預定二週云。木材市價上漲　　昨木材市况，柳安夾板及啓明本朽三夾板，市價報漲，杉木市價，昨又昂漲，因閩產地來電吿漲，致滬埠搜羅有人，市氣正盛。麵粉新盤　每袋准加六一五元　　本市麵粉雖經糧食部通知各省市禁止出口、但小麥原料，仍予紛紛運銷、致價格抬高，影響麵粉成本，因之黑市麵粉價超過市政常局所規定之麵粉售價一萬四千元，相差頗巨。據悉：今日起對於麵粉徵收捐稅及增加運輸費，成本允難維持，原規定之麵粉售價，仍經麵粉業同業公會負責人與杜月笙。於昨日下午六時許，在市府召集各業同業公會領袖商討穏定物價散會後，向吳市長要求，予以調　，結果吳市長允予麵粉每袋售價不得超過一萬四千六百十五元，如仍有黑市麵粉價發售，決予嚴懲。大餅油條　不准擅漲　　大餅油條，近自每條每餅五十元，漲一倍爲一百元，威脅一般貧民生活，吳市長悉心研究，認爲麵粉售價，及油價煤球，並不如是之波動，而大餅油條突然倍漲，殊不合理，決令飭所屬，嚴加制止，務令恢復原定售價，否則予以取締云。生砂軋缺　　昨糖市升降互見，公會劃盤現貨中砂白仍不及配價，爲十二萬八九千元，生砂赤以現貨軋缺，初僅十一萬五千元，最高曾達十二萬元，收盤十一萬九千五百元，同時棧單貨價十一萬三千五百元，受手不多，可見實係軋現所致，土糖開出黃崗靑十一萬二三千元，普通棉赤十一萬五千元，統共不上百包、省赤二百餘包，開十萬零六千元至八千元，刁靑建帮開出廣包荘十萬零八千元。客貨絡繹而來　米市店銷呆滯　　米市客貨登記達一萬二千餘石，台灣米又配售一千〇五十包，價目仍舊，粳米店消轉呆，去化不振，價小二三千元，　　客秞尙覺挺立，秈米產區價堅，粳米晚稻出貨期問漸近，人心見軟，黃豆聞東北續有大批抵申，大連黃豆　小千元，中次隨降三五百元，高貨尙定，小麥各埠消　依然沉悶，衹有小廠　動，價形平疲，紅糧苞米均無上落，芝蔴高貨相仿，中下等亦小千元，生仁南洋仍然不動，本街亦淡，陳貨小一二千元，新貨尙平，蠶豆零化尙殷，存到兩稀，再升二千元，麵粉廠價仍舊，塲外仍無正式價目，油市靑島來貨湧旺，軋小千元、豆菜油彷彿，豆餅台灣略取，價升一二百元。</p>

<p>沱河泗水戰場秋  本報九月十五日固鎮訊　特派員邵慎之　　記者淮上之行結束後，馳馬於沱河·泗水之間，憑弔今戰塲，度過今年的中秋。　　中秋日，這裏午夜前無月色，烏雲蔽天，秋雨霏霏。當地居民宰猪犒勞部隊於廢墟間。軍中有吹洞肅者，其聲嗚嗚，思鄉者聞而感泣。　　凉風起自天末，軍笳悲鳴，鹿角森森，　隊蹄聲，來去如驟雨，起伏於荒村野樹間。犬啤隱傳，而汽車馬達則如陳雷。登高望之，大地茫茫然，四無星火，惟足畔草　簡，有秋也切切而歌。瀟瑟秋意，陡感凈愁。這就是今代戰場！　　萬種傷心垓下曲　　靈　縣南五十里有濠城集，即古垓下。韓信戰敗項羽於此。四面楚歌，英雄泣下。然項羽不失爲失敗的英雄，而虞姬飲劍，益使千古慷慨。靈泗道上有虞姬墓，偃然荒邱，秋草　頒，惟歷代弔者不乏共人。如蘇轍弔虞姬墓云：「布叛增亡國已　摧殘羽　自今窮，艱難獨與虞姬共，誰使西來敵沛公？」頗有不値輕重之意。而蘇東坡則不然，有云：「帳下佳人拭淚痕，門前壯士氣如雲；蒼皇不負君王意，只有虞姬與鄭君。」就頗加讚揚。可是漢后呂雉死後，共塚却見辱於赤眉，眞不可同日而語。　　項羽盛時，會自齊回師擊敗劉邦五十六萬人於彭城，追之於睢水之濱，漢軍覆沒，睢水流斷。三國時，曹操擊徐州收陶謙，拔取宿遷·睢寗。靈璧，屠男女凡數十萬人，雞犬無有，泗水爲之不流。紀事見後漢書。然並不著稱於揚州三屠之役。是中國人素安於自相屠殺的綠故嗎？這是中國的秘密之一。　　古戰場，今戰場，處處彈痕血跡，殺人盈野，撫今追昔，萬種傷心！人民常前復遭受戰亂蝗虫洪水的災書，大軍過處，徵工派伕，出車送料，疲於應付。共軍在時，提出了「爲人民」的口號，而結果則無處不是「爲共軍」。記者所經之處，國軍取自共軍掌握僅月餘，處處荒田蔓草，野無道路，村無完屋，屋無人居者比比皆是。俱非直接毁於月前的戰火，而是共軍在時的遺跡。人民對共軍同樣缺乏政治信賴，卜畫卜夜的被領導於開會鬥爭淸算中，精神上稍無寗息，日無寗時，月無寗日。縱然共產黨的邊區政府，縣長以及其他人員，主觀上勇於接近大衆，但人民們旣不能相安於窮苦中，遂出諸相率逃亡之一途。　　記者渡沱河東行時，有一羣農民逃亡半年後，自固鈸返鄉，中途邂逅，彼等十數人皆非地主，亦非小自耕農，都是所謂「貧無立錐之地」的僱農，詢以逃亡原因，答謂：「我們怕沒飯吃嗎？天天開會鬥爭，一定要我們同老闆做成冤家對關才罷休，這些年來誰者過行苦，我們看樣子不對，就逃到固鎮云擺擺攤子，做做短活過日子。」家　殘破，戰　仍　，他們正不知何日始能獲得安定。　　靈璧殘城　草過膝　　　璧西有沱河，國共軍在此隔河對峙者，凡十二個月。游擊搜索，爲軍事進出之區。然沱河　始終在國軍手中，土牆圍繞，巢槍眼纍纍，房屋完好，秋柳依水，充滿北方鄉　所特有的　媚。鄕人担梨，遮道求售，其種與　山梨相同，索價每斤僅百元。　　自固鎭至　璧公路，長八十五華里，原係石子路，失修十年，近　車馬運輸頻繁，大雨過後，即泥　沒脛，交通完全阻塞。地方政府，乃發動民衆修築，僅止於挖土塡方，仍不能抗雨水之浸害，今年夏末秋初，雨水頻仍每雨必修民衆至爲勞苦。　　靈璧泗縣原爲日軍盤據多年，日本投　後，政府即派員入駐。共軍於八月二十日繼泗縣後攻入靈　謂係受降，實則日軍已向蚌埠集中，僞軍則於投降後奉命駐守，故有戰事。本年七月，國軍陸續取下　　泗縣，共軍會聯合配合靈　縣自衛大隊，僞軍一度反攻泗縣，戰事至爲慘烈。共軍傷亡達萬人。　　國軍攻取靈泗，即係循記者取道之固（鎭）泗（縣）公路，於七月十七日越過沱河，向東推進。縣長唐克南，係自靑陽調來，十六日在固鎭接篆，翌日即東行。逐步接觸，二十一日逼共軍於其最後據守之鳳凰山。二十二日以重砲拂曉攻擊，共軍潰退，遂克靈　。國軍入城時，城內民衆僅十四人，多處街道草深過膝，共軍原擬實施淸野之法，將全城破壞，國軍工兵工作一週，在各處挖出大量土製地雷及巨型木柄手溜彈（亦爲一種地雷）。爲共軍退却怨促，未及使其爆炸者。　　記者抵達　璧時，國軍以陸續推進，已七易城防司令官。民衆相繼歸來，的五千人，僅及戰前什一。秩序雖安定，但共方縣政府及專員供在五十里外，故鄉人來城貿易，僅能止於城外。　　靈璧城垣極堅，石基　垜，高逾三丈，爲淸代遺物，共軍去年佔靈　時，即徽發民衆萬人，自携鍋具糧食，窮十五晝夜之力，加以破壞，現僅餘一圈土阜，滿溝磚石，其他城內外各處廟宇寺觀，同被拆毀，即基督敎會亦不免，實不能推索其理由矣。現靈　所餘房屋，類皆茅茨土階，饒有古意，憶後漢時說文解字之作者許愼，曾治於此。入此殘破古城，懷一代文字學者，不知許愼其成偉大著作於此吾？　　鳳凰山麓聽民謠　　鳳凰山在城西北五里，爲黏板岩石之高阜，高的三十餘公尺，無樹木，上有碉堡，共軍曾加扼守。記者登山，惟見砲彈痕纍纍，當時碉堡亦被轟毀，現已加以修葺，且於週　佈拒馬，係截樹木爲之。由此可遙望四十里外之毛義山，仍爲靈璧縣境，共方專員以及宿吳銅蕭縣長，即駐留於城東北及西北地區，徵糧，擴軍，爲捲土重來計然該區靑年大率逃向靈璧縣城。靈璧水災甚嚴重，鳳凰山迤西北四十里內已成一內湖，近日水勢稍退，可略見赭色土地露出水面。共軍顯然已奉有不退出其原來統治區域的命令。　　鳳凰山之得失，即決定靈璧之得失。在山頂俯瞰靈璧，如指掌間。當時砲火猛烈，山麓居民，紛紛向東逃避，共軍曾作國軍如何殺人放火之宣傳，冀使民衆隨之而去，然共軍退却，砲火甫停，民衆即紛紛返歸家國。鳳凰山麓原爲膏沃之地，每畝可收小麥高梁各三百斤，現則蕪草滋蔓，已一年未施耕耘。　　皖北有民謠云：「盼中央，望中央，中央來了一掃光；寗願中央一掃光，不要八路叫大娘。」　　意即國軍來時，自必發生戰事，戰火旣發，則廬舍爲墟，一掃而光，可以想見，然此即可希望安定，免却共軍上門叫大娘（客氣語），鬧鬥爭。此種心聲極慘痛。中國人民今日求安定而不可得！小張村一婦女爲記者解釋此一民謠之意義。並謂「不說叫大娘了，剛一來，借什麼要什麼，就是向你叩頭也幹，可是以後鬧起鬥爭來，就動不動要你的頭了。眞是怕人！　　小張村即在山麓，村前石榴樹十餘株爲國軍砍去，以爲輔助工事之拒馬，村人無不惜之。一王姓織布工人，山東兗州人，十九歲時來小張村，今年已四十九歲，但仍操純料之兗州土話。對記者謂：「俺沒有田，也沒有地，鬼子來了，俺就停了工，躭着，拾草打把根，帮人家做個短活。就這麽糊偶口。八路軍來了，攪得你沒法兒講，有事沒事老開會。俺們做莊稼的那有這門閒功夫？唆你去鬥這個門那個，連一個鷄蛋那點兒大的事也要鬥上大半天。譬如說吧，問俺某人可借過俺的東西，俺想來想去，想到這人多久前借過俺一個鷄蛋，這就不得了，要俺去鬥他。俺們吃啥穿啥也得來管，穿好吃好點兒都不成，好歹不讓你得安。可是當八路的，吃得好長得胖，就沒說的。」靈泗獵影　本報特派員　邵慎之攝　　圖片說明　　〔右〕（上）歸來之靈璧農民驅驢磨高梁。（中）廢墟上的靈璧市集（下）沱河集（固鎭東廿五里鄕民挑黎遮道求售。〔左〕（上）收復後的靈璧縣政府。（下）國軍源源開入靈璧。星期論壇解决蘇北今後土地問題的關鍵  王素鍼　　在八月十一日申報星期論壇上，讀到葛克信先生「急待解決的蘇北土地問題」一文，覺得這實在是當前對於處理蘇北農村的一個重要課題，値得大家注意和提出來探討的。　　從蘇北難民要求還鄕到談判中共撤離蘇北，從新四軍在蘇北念遽施行「土地改革」到馬司聲明最難解決的問題！中共不放棄地方政權，可見蘇北問題是異常嚴重。同時，使我們聯想到蘇北問題的癥結——土地問題。　　中國是一個農業國家，蘇北更是具體表現着中國的農村狀况。一切經濟生活依附着農產品，常然影響農民生活的土地問題，自是道一地區中「急待解決」的主要問題了。　　從孫宋慶齡女士「對當前時局意見」，提出了「國民黨必須執行它的歷史任務—土地改革」後，一般爲中共辯護的論客，竟說是蘇北已實行了「土地改革」，農民已獲得了土地，並且宣傳蘇北民生問題已經如何如何改善，蘇北人民和當地「民主政府」發生怎樣親切的關係。天花亂隊，說得「像煞有介事一！　　其實，中共這一次在蘇北的「土地改革」，無論在理論上　作風上，都犯了嚴重的錯誤，和遭到不可諱言的失敗。　　葛光生因「未能深入中共控制地區，對於以人口爲比例·　行分田」的「土地改革」，「無從獲知其詳」。筆者是蘇北人，這番隨着蘇北軍事形勢的轉變，「深入」到「曾經中共　　區械」，方始獲悉當地「分田」實情。茲詳細記述於下：　　當「新四軍政府」宜佈所謂「改善民生土地改革方案」後，隨時分派「工作隊」下鄕，召集一切民兵幹部，選舉「翻身　表」，接着開鄉民大會，把這一鄕的地主找來算倒賬，算賬　式很奇突！除了佃戶倒押租，僱工倒工資外，一個呌化子從　在地主門前乞討，被地主家人打碎了一只討飯碗，一個佃農」從前地主下鄕時，供應了三個煎鷄蛋，以及地主家養的狗，　前和別家的狗打架，踩壞了人家田裏一棵苗……所謂「欲　之葬，何患無辭」。在這些橫七豎八的「算賬帽子」之下·　主所有田地房產，依照複利法，整憫捧出還不够。「翻身代　」就呌他（地主）先把田契拿出來抵還上面這些「債務」，　主如有抗議由辯，或回說老契遺失，馬上認爲是「頑固份子一，「破壞份子」，　他跪在屋頂上朝南「望老中央」。假使　天半天逼不出來，跟着再使用一切「民主的」拷打，直到地　挨不着痛苦，將田契交出，或者承認家產全部托出，自己一　願」去討飯爲終結。至於逃亡在外的地主田地，則由「民主　府」定「罪」沒收，或由地主田隣出而代算代賣，非常簡單　速。地主田地算出後，「工作隊」再召集一鄉「群衆」開大　，說明大家算到舊賬了，窮人從此翻身了。但這是「人民的勝利」，大家要「公平分配勝利果實」。那個被打碎一隻討飯碗算回幾十畝地的呌化子，這時又要把他的「財產」拿出來，分給大家；結果，依照每一鄕土地面積和人口密度來平均分配土地。在所謂「一分區」裏，每一鄉最多每人分到二畝半地，最少每人分到一畝七八分地。分田界址量定後，分田人就指定得田裘的穀物。那些種了人家數十畝地的佃農，也要把苦心耕耘好的田裏的穀物，白白送給人家去收割。這些佃農，不但沒有得到「勝利果實」，有些計算起來，還遭着超過了完納地主租穀那麼多的損失。至於自耕，中農，富農，所受分田的影響，當然是更不必談起了。　　在理論上，中共曾經信誓旦旦，放棄「土地革命」澈底實行三民主義。毛澤東氏並又高唱「新民主主義」，實行减租减息，增加工資，在黃炎培先生「延安歸來」一書　，更說到毛澤東也發覺從前黨八股洋八股的不對，發覺農民並不一定需要有田，只要自己有田種。農民爲了經濟週轉，有時也需要借一點債，所以延安還有地主，延安倡導减租减息，但保證交租交息。延安情形是否如此，恕筆者不得而知。可是，在蘇北的中共，現在却推翻了延安的一切諾言和宣示，使人們對於共產黨的「言」「行」發生懷疑，同時在政策的推行上，中共却得到整個蘇北農民不滿情緒高漲的反映。　　有些　居在上海洋房裏，專事製造革命理論的作家們，也許會這樣發問：農民分得了土地，不是比不分土地時改善得多嗎？這樣改善了以後，農民應該獗悅，那裏會有什麼不滿的反映呢？　　這便是那些作家們不體騐實際情形，祗知獨下武斷，和中共斷然的「幹」下去那樣犯了同一的病。試問：（一）每人分得一畂七八分地的農民，就已經豐衣足食了嗎？（二）這一鄕每人分地一畝七八分，另一鄉每人分地二畝半，土地已算均分了嗎？（三）所謂實現「耕者有其田」，不種地的地主我們暫不管他，但那些自耕·中農·富農，是都種田地的，原來生活寬裕，而現在生活不足，會滿意道一種妄加於他們的「改善」嗎？　　或者又有人要說：從前不分地時，大家也能度過了，現在把地主的田全部分了出來，大家反不能過，生活不足，却是爲什麽呢？我們假使統計一下蘇北目前人口和土地面積，並且深入調査了農村經濟實情後，便知道目前蘇北雖還是一個農業經濟的鄕村，但因農民人口急遽增加，已不能完全依靠農產品，而是需要工商販運，向外發展的了。　　舉幾個實例：在筆者調齊的某一鄉村裏，某戶種地不多，家裏少壯男子有好幾個，這一家就衹留了兩個男子在家耕作，其餘的都上鎭和到遠地去操工商業，做帮工。某戶種地不够全家食用，這家在農閒時就蕩船到各地去做生意，到上海拉黃包車，到江南做短季工，以補足每年食用的不敷。某戶人口不多，不種田，不種地，簡直就靠在人家做帮工解決生活，其餘一切複雜的情形還很多，總之，不完全祇靠「自耕」來解決生活，却是廣泛的情形。　　那末研究一下中共的「分田」情形是怎樣呢？按照每鄕所有人口分配，有多少人給你多少田種，至於「按照每鄉所有人口分配」的結果，不管你人有多少，田够不够，橫竪給你「平分」了就算事。有一個夫妻兒媳一戶六口的佃農，他家種了六十畝地，按照往年完繳地租，肥料種籽的消費，每年可凈餘七八十石穀子，足够一家溫飽。今年「分田」後，他祇得田十畝有零，繳去公糧而外，預計祇得到二十多擔穀子，生活陡然「改惡」，加上今年麥熟所得，又多換了肥料種籽，替分他田地的人，白種了五十多畝地。所謂照顧工農大衆的「民主政府」，它所給予農民的，是一個深重的打擊，而廣大盤民所給它的反映，是一個不滿的表示。　　雖然，「新四軍」的「民主政府」，已經這樣不民主地强迫「幹」下去了，但我們不是聽到高郵·曲塘。海安。如皋·各地鄉村，都繼續不斷地燃起了暴動的火炬，這些解放怒火，不都是被「民主善政」所助燃起來的嗎？　　再說在作風方面，一切「算賬」「倒租」，簡直成了訛詐的無賴手段·禮義廉恥·道德法律，完全不顧。政府不導人民守「法「却導人民作」亂」，試問世界上有那一個國家的社會組織是只需要亂，而不需要治的呢？這一點，恐怕中共在其萬分對蘇北的掩飾上，也不得不承認「有些幹部作風犯了錯誤的病」吧！然而這些「錯誤的病」，在「上層領導的出發點上，就已經犯了。試想沒有上面一樣公開的「指導」，有那一個中國人會無中生有地說，某人從前吃了他三個蛋，現在要向他算回幾十畝田呢？　　無論歷史敎訓如無論無何，這一次中共在蘇北的「分田」措施，已經遭到不可諱言的失敗！中共在蘇北失敗的試騐，也正是「國民黨必須執行它的歷史任務——土地改革」的借鑑。　　我們應知道共產黨的「改革」，乃是沒有看到問題的癥結；我們現在所要急切硏究的，就是它的癥結所在。從中共的失敗，可以得到下面幾個結論：　　（一）農民的期望，與其說在分配土地，不如說在分得足够生活的穀物。　　（二）農民的要求，不在分配土地如何平允，而在設法增加穀物的收穫，使大家的生活不虞匱乏。　　（三）農民需要各盡所能，各取所需，却不願意他的自由向上發展的希望爲人所限制。　　根據以上各點，我們便應該注意到：蘇北租佃制度如何改善？對於限制土地集中的土地法，應如何施行？改良農塲增加生產的農業技術，應如何積極推行？　　先言租佃制度。在中國，無論在蘇北或其他各地農村，從來都有許多不合理的現狀存在。現在政府實行二五减租，當然减輕佃農的負担不少。這一點，希望各地各級政府，能切實迅速執行。同時，對於各地方「板租」（無論年歲荒熟，都要照繳地主租穀）「預租」（預先繳存應完租穀，收成有無與地主無涉）種種地主剝削壓迫的制度，亦由各地政府嚴令取締。　　關於限制土地集中，我很贊成葛先生「對於超額土地，除以累進率徵收其田租所得稅，……超額過多的，由政府發給土地債券，酌量收買一部份」的提議。土地過度集中，增加地主剝削壓迫的不良勢力，同時地主們「衣稅食租」，耽於逸樂，減少社會的進步力量。試問蘇北　有三四百畝至數千畝土地的地主，他們除了每年計算租殼而外，有幾個人提倡過改良農場，或放棄土地而投資工廠業，以造福他們的家鄉，建設他們的祖國呢？所以我想，只有政府用上述兩種方法來壓迫地主們，使他們對於土地的興趣减低，而注意到投資工商業方面。這樣，土地纔不致長久集中在地主手裏，而達到「耕者有其田」的目的。　　至於改良農業，更是當務之急。國父曾經說過：「中國沒有大資產家，只有大貧小貧。中國的病在愚，窮，弱。」是的，像蘇北農村那樣「窮」陋的情形，就是它還是用的舊式耕種的「愚」法，所以在那片廣大的沃野上，每年要比人家少着若干萬担的收穫，並且還不能抗拒天災人禍的侵襲。像興化一帶蕩地，每年祗有一屬稻收，假使今後能把水利調整好，不是可以增加一季麥熟，又多得若干萬担的糧食嗎？　　蘇北，目前已隨軍事形勢有了轉變，從前被共軍「改亂」了的土地問題，現在是迫切需要政府來設法「改善」，而對於改善的方法，更是需要愼重應付的。　　推進區內瘡痍滿目，葛藤萬千，尤非向收復區「接收」敵產所可比擬。共黨的「土地改革」，已經在蘇北「失去人心」，故政府對今後處理蘇北農村的辦法，應加緊「收拾人心」。如何收拾人心？筆者以爲起碼應能做到下列各點：　　（一）參酌從前所頒「各省農村土地處理條例，」妥愼解決一切土地問題。　　（二）調整業主佃農關係，使業佃糾紛公正解決。　　（三）救濟貧農，改善其生活，使他們直覺共黨宣傳爲欺騙。　　（四）嚴禁「還鄕團」反算賬，或使用壓力，至一切個人糾紛，統由鄉區公所解決（或另設農村委員會，由政府，業，佃，公正士紳組成），或向法院起訴，完全依法辦理。　　　（五）嚴防搗亂份子，潛伏鼓動，破壞秩序。　　（六）對於荒地公田，應詳細核査處理，有主田地，査明發還，無主田地，不能任令曚蔽荒廢。　　（七）改進農業技術，救荒增產，利用目前時機，積極開發蘇北。　　（八）充實農民自衛力量，嚴防匪徒擾害農村。　　（九）建設公路以及衛生設備，領導正常活動，增進農村文明　　（十）普及識字敎育，推進農業敎育，改造農民思想，各縣區公所，應　人農村，注意農村問題。　　以上不過僅就管見所及，不能調爲完全。但是筆者以爲處理轉變後的蘇北農村，千頭萬緒，看似煩難，而循章按理，亦殊勿致。因爲蘇北農村中的地主，多年來遭受敵僞共軍不斷摧殘蹂躪，對於土地與經濟觀念，當亦表現其開明，而一般貧民，覺悟遭受共黨欺騙後，亦應翻然改途，業佃合作，努力生產，共助三民主義革命事業之推進。久亂必治，這未始非蘇北與國家之福，不過，區鄕工作人員，也應充分表現他們的廉潔與負責任，致力於收復人心。（本文原定星期日發表，因篇幅關係，特於今日補登。）</p>

<p>婦女与家庭婦女到哪裏去？  文　　婦女到底是要回到廚房裏去呢，還是走向社會裏去？這，在今日，仍然不失其爲婦女問題爭執的焦點，甚至也可以說是婦女問題之所以成爲問題的關鍵。這裏，筆者將世界名人對於這問題的意見，摘譯如下，勉强作爲答案。　　羅斯福總統夫人：要視環境情形而定，不可論斷，亦無固定的途徑可循。　　威爾斯：婦女原是　歡男子的保護。現代社會情形已使夫　的關係改變，故現在夫妻間的關係，沒有一定的方式。　　　　：　　完全是金錢在作　。　　　　斯：婦女過分自由是很危險的事。一個美滿的婚　　　　一種經濟與社會性的連合組織，而且它必須是　　　　起來，成爲一體。　　　　人：男子總是高興女子依靠他的——這問題完全　　　妻間諒解的程度而定。　　包　：在經濟上能自給的婦女，更惹人生愛。　　赫勞里：好母親應該出外工作，婦女成爲新女性，才能　　史好的母親。在兒童敎育上可以有更新的興趣，更好　　，和親子間的更深的瞭解。兒時的經驗  泰　　（一）竊盜行爲　　我八歲的時候，有一天，我在窗下玩耍，白太太對我的母親說了一些秘密的話，都給我聽見了。白太太走後，母親知道我聽見了她們的談話，　對我說：「如果今天白太太忘記了帶走她的手提包，我們會把她的手提包交給別人嗎？」　　「當然不會」，我回答。　　母親繼續說：「今天白太太遺留下了一件比她的日記　還重要的東西，她遺下了一段能使許多人不快活的談話。雖然她忘記了帶走這些談話，這些談話仍然是屬於她的，因此我們不能把這些談話交給別的任何人，你明白嗎？」　　我明　的。從此以後，我知道凡是　　呌我保守的秘密，或者朋友無意中在言語上洩漏的秘密，都是屬於他的東西，我不能够把這些東　西交給另外一個人。現在朋友都喜歡到我家裏來，因爲他們都能够暢所欲言，即使孩子也不會把他們的秘密洩漏出去。道一點功勞是應該歸給我的母　　（二）驕傲的代價　　當我九歲，我的妹妹七歲的時候、我們兩人都得到了校中最優等的獎狀。因此我們認爲我們的家庭是優秀的家庭，我們向同學們誇耀我們自己的聰明。父親聽見了、就呌了我們去。　　父親把一隻輕氣球吹得像一個人頭那麽大小，莊嚴地對我們說，氣球的名字呌愛瑪，是一個很聰明的人，父親跟着就把愛瑪的生平叙述出來，每說到愛瑪成功的時候，就把氣球吹大一點。故事愈說愈長，愛瑪愈吹愈大，到後來大得竟把我們嚇得遠遠避開。到愛瑪漲大到將近破裂的時候，父親的故事突然停止了。　　「現在你們都不敢和愛瑪接近了，是嗎？」父親問我們：「愛瑪那麽驕傲，又有那麽大的頭。當你們向同學們誇耀自己的時候，同學們對你們的感想，正如你們對愛瑪的感想一樣，你們那麽驕傲，沒有人敢和你們接近了。　　從此以後，每次我們做了些値得驕傲的事情之後，我們就想起了愛瑪的大頭，自大的思想馬上就消失了。　　（三）公平的方法　　我和弟弟每次從學校回來的時候，總感到　餓。有一天，我們放學回來，就向母親要東西吃，母親把一塊餅放在我們前面，一把小刀放在旁邊，對我們說；「你們兩人中任那一個把餅分開，另外一個有優先選擇權。」　　我的弟弟很敏捷，把刀搶了過來，要將餅切成大小兩塊。突然問他停了手，望了望母親又望了望我，然後把餅切成大小一樣的兩塊。讓我先拿了，他才拿剩下的一塊。　　從此以後每逢到分東西——餅，麵包，牛油——吃，都分成大小一樣的兩塊，我們學會了永遠要尊敬他人的權利。當你的孩子墜入戀愛中  鳳　　當你發覺你將成年或已成年的兒女近來似乎有些神思恍惚，喜怒無常，而且特別注重於修飾的話，你可能懷疑到他（她）是墮入了戀愛中了。那麽親愛的家長們，你們不必慌張，也不可置之不問，這正是負起你最偉大而神聖的責任的時候了！　　有許多家長喜歡以恐嚇，盤問，甚至怒駡來對待他們那內心正燃燒着熾烈的戀火的孩子們，它的結果，也許是失敗的。因爲戀愛不是一件尋常的衣物，它的神秘，甜蜜，和魅力決不是父母們三言兩語所能解除。反之，假如一個戀愛時間的靑年得不到正確的指示。敎導，和愛護，可能發生意想不到的危險與悲慘的結局。我們該承認：戀愛不是一件　反道德不正常的舉動，尤其是靑年人，那根本是一種自然的慾望和衝動。　　首　，你該對你的孩子表示你對他（她）正當的交友或戀愛是相當的同意或讚美，因爲一個人活動的能力及酬酢的技巧多半是在交友中長成的。同時，你可以授意他（她），呌他（她）時常　朋友們來談天聚會，對於對方的性格，習性，脾氣應該有一個　靜及詳細的觀察，切不可因一時的衝動而盲口的戀愛。也許在戀愛中的他（她）們需要時常出外遊玩散步，你最好不要加以阻止。在戀愛伊始或正濃的常兒即使禁止也是枉然的，而反而損害了他（她）的自尊而引起惡感。到他（她）已到了很熟的時期，你不妨提議呌他們在家裏談談天，交換些各人的理想，討論些學識的問題；這樣，不單不會妨害彼此間的情感，反可使他（她）們的戀愛不趨凡俗虛僞而進入高尙和相互合作互助的境地。　　至於經濟方面，你是應該考慮的，你不必給他（她）很多的錢使他（她）儘情遊玩浪費；也不能不給而使他（她）難以爲人。每個人，尤其在戀愛時期，他（她）的自尊和虛榮總似乎重些。有許多靑年就是因爲家裏不給錢，就發生借貸或偸竊的行爲而造成不堪設想的結果，這是家長們該注意到的。　　似如你發覺他（她）的戀人無論在性情上，興趣上，生活上，都和他（她）不適宜的話，你該在慈愛而嚴肅的態度中，儘量的解釋這種戀愛的痛苦的後果及對他（她）的影響，使他（她）自身覺悟到其間的矛盾和苦痛，爲了珍貴的前途而放棄此心。但友誼依舊可繼續存在，因爲朋友之間的情感決不單祇是戀愛呵。　　萬一不幸他（她）失戀了怎樣呢？我希望你不要笑他（她）或駡他（她），因爲那時他（她）的心已是够悲悒和苦痛的了。你該表示你對於他（她）不幸的遭遇有深切的同情和關懷；同時，你要儘量的設法使他（她）忘了以往的辛酸悲　而給他（她）一種新的啓示和鼓勵，或者，給他（她）改換一下環境而把痛苦漸漸地忘懷。你記得「茶花女」中亞猛（Armand）的父親，當亞猛失去了他所熱愛的馬格麗特Marquerite姑娘後，所給他的解釋和安慰，然後再帶他回家的一舉嗎？戀愛是一塲熱病，有時確實如此！　　在你敏　慈和的啓示和指導下，你的孩子將都能得到圓滿和快樂的戀愛。　　我祝福他（她）們！家事常識  聖惠　　米（或箱）內放辣椒數枚，或螃蟹二三隻，可使米日久不蛀。皮衣曝晒後，宜掛於屋簷下或屋內，侯吹凉後再裏以烟葉數片然後藏入箱中可以免蛀。　　設若樟腦價昂可用花椒代之，十數粒壹包置於衣服箱內，其功用與樟腦同，或放浮水之蘆甘石（藥店有售）於四隅，可收濕氣，永不生蛀蟲，　　雨衣穿後，應陰乾收藏，且忌重壓。　　書櫉中藏芸香（又名七里香）可辟　．　　茶壺茶碗等瓷器中，如有積垢，以食鹽擦之或刷洗之垢立去，陶器亦然。本年九月在大西洋城當選之　美國小姐</p>

<p>春秋給浪潮中的孩子們  中原　　你們都長大了。看見你們壯健的體格，活潑的精神，英俊的儀表，我就想起春天蓬勃的花草。生命的熱力充沛在你們裏頭，你們在燦爛的陽光裏吸收溫暖，清馥的露水中吮取芬芳；你們要開花，結實，用無比美麗的光彩來創造新的世界。這個偉大的時代是屬於你們的了。　　你們還稱呼我「先生」，使我慚愧。雖然我並不忘記六年以前，我確曾在一所小小的教室裏做過你們的先生。我教你們唸「ABCD」；我告訴你們喜馬拉雅山在什麽地方；孔夫子生在什麽年代。有時候你們嬉笑頑皮，我還裝出過嚴厲的臉孔給你們訓誨。我那裏想到，一轉瞬間，一羣天真頑皮的孩子已經跨進大學。而我，雖然照年齡算起來，並沒有比你們大幾歲，然而這區區的幾歲，竟使我沉痛地感到我的春天已經過去了。　　你們來看我，我心中說不出的感謝。你們告訴我許多大學裏面的情形，給了我我無窮的興奮。你們取出漂亮的紀念冊來呌我題寫，我統統愉快地照搬了。然而當你們揮拳擊掌地向我述說你們的見解和懷抱時，我的心突然莫名其妙地顫動起來。　　我自己也不知道爲什麽當時我是那樣的沉默。我沒有贊成你們的見解，也沒有反對。我只是靜靜地聽著你們的話，默默地看著你們的臉。你們問我：「先生，你以爲對嗎？」我笑著不回答。於是你們就去了，帶著一點掃興的情緒。　　也許你們不是真的掃興，因爲過了一天，你們又來了。你們竟恢復了六年前的頑皮，拖住了我的手說：「先生，我們不要聽無關緊要的話，我們要聽你心裏面的話，像你的文章一樣！」我苦笑了。文章！是的，這幾年中，大概你們見過許多我的文章。可是呵！我的文章就是我的歎息，我的文章就是我的眼淚；難道我能給你們的歎息？給你們的眼淚？……　　然而你們苦苦地纏繞著我，最後我只好答應你們說：「好吧！等我定下心來的時候，我就寫信給你們！」　　孩子！（恕我仍像以前一樣稱呼你們。）你們在等待我的信吧？　　今夜是陰曆七月廿七，沉暗的夜空時那樣的靜寂。我在一盞微淡的燈下取出六年前和你們同攝的照片。照片裏面的你們，天真，無邪，純潔，像一團團純白的棉花，一朶朶嬌嫩的睡蓮。可是突然，一個黑影掠過我的眼前，掠過照片，掠過你們天真無邪純潔的臉。……　　這個黑影是什麽？孩子，我不想把你們引到高高的空中，叫你們到空幻的夢境中抓去真理。我要把你們拉回到遙遠的從前，先讓你們重溫一個過去的舊夢。　　你們還罷還記得，在那麼一個鳥語花香的春天，我帶著你們到野外去遊玩。我指給你們看遠處的高山，高山上的流溪，天空的白雲，白雲底下的大海。於是我告訴你們，無論是高山，流溪，白雲，大海，都是從一個個微小的單位凝聚起來的。所以我們不能小看高山上的一粒，大海中的一滴；雖然牠們看起來是那麼的渺小，幾乎顯不出自己的存在。　　你們也總記得，說到這個地方的時候，我伸出手來拍拍你們的每一個人的肩胛，笑著說：「你們每一個可愛的孩子，就是高山上的一粒，大海中的一滴，不論現在或是將來，你們都不能小看自己的地位！」　　那個時候你們的年紀太小吧。你們竟不懂得我的話，望著我癡癡地笑了，因此我就沒有把未盡的意思再說下去了。　　現在，你們當然是懂得了。就讓我在這裏把那一點未盡的意思說下去吧。　　我想我可以說得簡單一點，只和你們討論二個字，就是「靜」和「動」。　　嚴格地說起來，世界上也許是沒有絕對的「靜」存在。高山靜靜的矗立著。可是高山裏面的　一粒細沙，無處不在千變萬化，　　　　　乎靜土爭流，但仔細看看，溪邊的水珠，依然在滴滴答答。至於白雲大海，那是不必說，任憑怎樣風平浪靜，總是在幻變推移，總是有細細的微波。　　所以我們只能略爲馬虎，把個「靜」字的標準降低，我們只能這樣說：不是山崩地裂就算靜；沒有驚濤巨浪就算靜；緩緩的散步，輕輕的細語，低低的沉思，默默的凝視，都算靜！　　靜的反面是「動」，那麼我們不也就可以照樣解釋：山崩地裂是動，驚濤巨浪是動，急步疾奔，暴跳狂呼，……總之凡一切能震撼人心的，都是動！　　孩子！分別就在這裏面了：我是愛「靜」的，然而你們卻愛著「動」！　　我不是不承認你們的理由。我絕對承認：整個宇宙，整個世界，整個人類走獸，飛禽，昆蟲，海洋山河，花草樹木，所以能這樣進化，所以能一天天地趨向更完善美滿的境界，就是因爲自古以來，天地萬物在不斷地變化，不斷地在「動」。　　我也承認：有時候「動」是自然的現象，有時候是人爲的東西。牠有時突然而來，有時逐漸發生。　　然而不管自然或者人爲，不管突然或者逐漸，孩子！我要告訴你們一句話：「動」是可怕的！非至不得已的時候，「動」是應該盡力避免的！　　而現在，卻正是一個「動」的時代！　　你們的見解不能算錯。洶湧的巨浪激起來了，你們豈能再靜止不動！你們豈不應該趁著波濤澎湃，衝到生命的最高潮！你們豈不應該趁著這股巨大的力量，奮勇地區衝毀一切舊的，壞的，腐的，假的；來創造新的，善的，美的，真的！……　　你們向我說這些話的時候，記得我是始終沒有開口；只是我好像曾輕輕問了一句：「假使狂濤巨浪把你們捲入了深黑的海底呢？」　　你們立刻大聲回答：「我們有信仰，我們的信仰就是我們的舵。」　　　於是我對你們笑笑，沒有再說什麽話了。　　孩子！現在我也不想向你們多說什麽話。我尤其不想使你們掃興，來否定你們的見解，減滅你們的熱血和勇氣。我更明白這是個什麽時代，什麽世界，我和你們之間又有著如何遙遠分界？　　然而孩子！因爲我看著你們長大，我還是要對你們又一些小小的希望。我希望：――　　等到風浪稍息的時候，你們能暫時從狂濤巨浪的漩渦中退出來，推到清涼的海灘上休息一會，看著浪濤到底是否衝去了舊的，壞的，腐的，假的；還是衝來了更多的亂的，假的，暗的，黑的？……　　等到風平浪靜的時候，你們能用真理的手帕揩乾沾在眼簾上的水珠，仔細地看看，你們在狂濤急渦中抓握的「信仰」，真的是一根把持方向的舵呢？還是僅不過是一塊不成形狀的斷木破竹？或竟是一對有害無用的毒物？……　　孩子！我的話就到這裏爲止了，此刻我仍在微淡的燈下注射你們的照片，願和平仁慈的上帝祝福你們！張聿光畫展  北海　　聿光先生在抗戰初起時，即赴後方，八九年中，備歷艱苦，而作畫從未稍輘。疊在重慶，成都，昆明等處，舉行個展，與張大千並稱「二張」。　　其實，聿光先生在藝壇的成就，遠在張大千之前。遜清末年，「民呼」「民立」報的諷刺畫，這是中國報紙諷刺畫的最先導。他同時是西畫的倡導著。民國初元，任上海美術院（即上海美專前身）校長，造就西畫人材不少。我國西畫發轉與民初，迄民十五前後，曾有蓬勃發皇的氣象，推本溯源，不得不歸功於聿光先生的啟示。所惜九一八事變以後，這新藝術運動，也隨之而消沉。抗戰勝利之後，後方藝人，紛紛歸來，而聿光先生，直等到今年夏天，方纔輾轉到滬。已經是鬢髮都白，幡然一老了。相見之後，不勝滄桑人世之惑，尤其是關於藝術運動一端，雖經文化人士的提撕以及政府方面的獎披，無如在目前環境中，依然得不到一般的注意。報紙上既不能與體育同樣的重視，而若干地方人士，竟還有取消藝術教育設施的主張。凡是經過藝術運動歷程的同人，大抵都要愴然與喟罷！　　聿光先生的圖畫，是滲合西畫的以爲，故自號爲「冶歐齋」。從本月二十六日起，至十月五日止，假甯波同鄉會舉行個展。所寫除花鳥及四川的風景外，並有民族英雄故事數十幅。風景之中如「丹山碧水」，題句云：「煙波無限夕陽紅，赤壁飛來插蜀峰，此是長江西上景，先生攬入畫圖中。」「峨眉籠洞」題句云：「幽叢峭石掩雲烟，攜練跳珠瀉澗泉，樓頭澄墨狀奇境，未應驚起洞龍眠。」又「石堡岩」題句云：「峨峨秦將軍，峨眉自英武，盡揮白桿兵，西來拒黃虎。森璧筑堅壘，結寒保鄉土。擊戝戝畏之，遺構峙千古。」均可稱爲力作。此外，有「峨眉金頂」一副，飄渺靈奇，尤臻上乘。　　聿光先生近年國畫，據私人見解，似以花鳥最擅勝場。所寫雞，鶴，孔雀之類，無不飛揚生動，色彩絢麗。筆意由奔放而歸於含蓄，其工夫日增月進，正顯示出他將達到丹成九轉的徵侯。丹山碧水  張聿光詩  法紀德作　杞柳譯　　那柔和的微風，曾撫摸最美麗的花朶。我靜靜地聽著，宇宙第一個早晨的歡歌。　　清晨的溫馨，旭日的光芒，沾滿露珠的花瓣……　　對於最誠摯的勸戒，無庸猶豫的屈服。而讓遙遠的將來，慢慢地將你埋葬。　　現在她已姍姍來臨，那黃昏的溫慰和輕撫，就是最頹唐的心靈，也會任憑愛情的宰制。藝術的永生  墨萸　　前幾時在春秋上寫了一篇「藝術的否定」，朋友都以爲我對藝術的看法，尤其是對藝術在這個時代裏面的進程，估定得太主觀，推論得太肯定；因此他們認爲：這無異對現在蹣跚著的中國藝術，表示一種姑息和溺愛，於藝術的創作前途上會增加荒怠和疏編的氣息的。　　昨天去看個精於刻印的友人，他正在一間湫隘而又局促的斗室中摹臨周秦古銝。外面是一片喧呶和囂雜，這屋子裏卻顯得異樣的清幽與寂靜。通過了他那虔誠的奏力姿態，我發現了一顆顆印章的方寸之間，仿佛浮漾著他自己恬然自適的生命，一種藝術工作者具有的真切而飛揚的生命。我從他每一個凝練輕盈的刀鋒和轉角中，更體會到藝術工作者特有的那種生之欣慰，面對著他那許多標準蒼勁的作品，再看看他身外堆置著的簡陋而蕪亂的衣物，我呼吸道了藝術工作者在他「自己的天地」裏面所表現出來的牽真而純潔的情操。我開始懂得了自己，對於藝術本身的主觀說明了我們隊藝術工作的濃烈的執著。歌德爲了自己愛慕的戀人，寫出最美麗的詩篇；蕭邦爲了國亡家破的痛楚，性靈的解放。耶和華爲了一個堅強不移的信念，向群眾獻出燦爛的生命。居裡夫人在科學探險的途程上，侵蝕了她一生豪華的歲月。他們在自己的天地裏面更填補了歷史的空白。李白答覆人家「問余何事棲碧山」？祗有一句：「笑而不答心自閑」。淡淡的情懷，完全根源於追求一種超越意境以外的滿足。唯有這種滿足纔是藝術生命的永恆。藝術工作者的生命里沒有罅隙，因爲他們和殉道者，科學家一樣在生活裏面有著「自己的天地」，他們在自己的天地裏面一點一滴地塑造了人性的慰藉，我肯定他們的成就正是增加他們這種深入藝術的斬荊披棘的勇氣和決心。藝術工作者有他崇高的自我渴求，他不會因爲一點毀譽，就變得疏懶與荒怠，因爲他們自己的天地裏面永恆的閃爍著決不枯涸的靈魂。　　但是現實生活的擔子是沉重的，前述那位治印的朋友，今年從大後方回到上海，庸俗的社會使他常常荒疏了對周奏古銝的更深遂的發掘，整日以宋元雜印應付著一般商儈們的需求，這當然是我們期待藝術者的一種無可補償的損失。他曾經用沉痛的語氣對我說過：「想不到我麼竟完全拿藝術的遷就和迎合來換取生活了」！　　在充塞著以「增篆康熙字典」或是一本「六書通」就自居爲金石家的上海，看到了一兩個手摹心追於創作藝術的真正的治印者，畢竟是可以聊感慰藉的。我們渴盼金石工作者能夠爲中國藝術開拓出一片膏沃的原野來，正和我們企待其他藝術部門的工作者能夠爲這世紀的藝術的完整前途獻出真摯的努力來的心情是相等的。　　生活的擔子絕對不能使藝術萎縮，我們應該更主觀的肯定藝術在這個時代裏的進程和成就，藝術的生命終究是永恆的。一寸山河一寸血　　49  葉勁風　　　「芬」，鼎元對他的太太說，「我告訴你一句話；你們都知道我困頓了這們多年，從來沒痛快痛快過一天，學了一點玩意，從來就沒人賞識過。瞧岳大哥這回，怎麼說，怎麼好；要什麽條件，人家都答應。我覺得我揚眉吐氣的日子到了。書上說，『君知我報君，友知我報友』。就放開國家軍隊的大事不談，難道我還不應該『感恩知己』，『力疾從公』？況且我精神也很好了，心上的結子也開了……老大哥」。他一邊下床，一邊對我說，「她們娘兒倆的意見，說句笑話，正是『婦女之見』哪，婆婆媽媽的。你要是不太費事，車子越快越好，瞧咱把事情辦一個『得勝頭面』！……老大哥，您真得陪我走一這才好，那邊我一個人卻不認識呢！怎看？」　　十點二十分鐘後，車子來了，還有兩名押車的領隊。正是三十七師馮治安師長部下，宛平是他的直屬，所以一路直衝，毫無困難；也沒纔多大的圈子。我把站望的事，交給〇四號，呌他有事的話，可打電話到北平行動總部，就可以轉給我了。　　車子開到電廠去接鼎元，他早已打扮齊整，就像去做新郎似的，一套白嗶嘰西服，雖說有了十八歲的年紀，都泛了黃，可熨得那麼平整。雪白襯衫，白底藍點的橫領結；鞋子可還是那雙起了皺紋的黃鞋，老英國式樣，卻加工上了些油，擦得真亮。帽子倒是有一頂，因爲衰頹得無法診治，祗好放棄了。　　上車的時候，太太說了一路的吉利句子，「馬到功成」，「一帆風順」……孩子們，梅君領頭，一手牽著小丁香，一手牽著小弟弟土義，大弟弟士仁和二小姐蘭君，排在後邊一點，見爸爸散了車，都揮著手，大聲嚷道：「爸爸再見……！伯父再見！……早點回來」！　　我一邊吩咐勤務開車，一邊回頭給吳太太，梅君，孩子們，揮手，說「再見」的時候，瞥見吳太太和梅君都在拿手絹擦著眼淚。我心下忽然感覺到一陣莫名其妙的空虛，泛了起來，無因無由，感到一陣心酸，也想痛痛快快流幾滴眼淚才好。再一回頭，看見鼎元眼睛圈也正紅著，眼眶邊似乎有些濕潤潤地。我想人類到底是有感情的動物哩。　　我們十二點左右抵達北平。見了Ｗ君之後，只談了幾句話，他便指點我們怎麼辦，辦些什麽，上什麽地方去，見什麽的人。這一切的事，都一步步照辦，十分順手。鼎元投效在馮治安部下，就在師部總務處通訊科，擔任技師職務，中校等級，太太和梅君雖未授職，師部已經成立傷兵醫院多處，隨時可以參加服務。　　事情一切手續剛剛辦畢，Ｗ君忽然來了電話，呌我動身回長辛店之前，到他那裡談幾句話。我因爲鼎元事情順利成功，也想到Ｗ君部裏打電話回長辛店，讓人光送信到鼎元家裏面，呌他們好放心。</p>

<p>自由談越劇話劇  少夫　　據警察局報吿，本市越劇戲院，現在已有四十七家，申請開設的尙有二十幾家；另一面，演話劇的塲所本來有五家，現在祇剩三家了。　　越劇的流行，是抗戰發生以後的事，爲什麽流行，我曾經問過好多朋友，甚至耽迷於它的人，所得的答復，大概祇有一個，就是通俗。假使從這個答案來衡量它的觀衆，那麽觀衆還是停滯在公子後花園定情的公式故事，和單調的音樂中，我們的責任太重大了。　　八年的時間，畢竟不能算短促，大多數的觀衆所能接受的娛樂趣味和　　術欣賞，還是這樣的一種程度，自然覺得可悲，　　越劇的從業員中，不少遠見之士，她們或他們都已注意到故事內容的問題，人們也相信假使越劇還牢守這一形式和內容，它的黃金時代也不會過長久的。　　話劇應該接近大衆的，但邇來話劇戲院這樣的悽慘，是單純的怨責觀衆不長進嗎？未免不公道！倘使以上海在淪陷期間話劇那樣的煊赫一時，對比目前的冷落，自怨自艾之餘，該仔細檢討一下它的造成因素的。關於「倮倮」  一鶴　　「倮倮」這兩字對於我們好像有些生疏，它是一個部族的名稱，「倮倮」民族居住我國西南部的深山中，文化水準相當的低，但是我們不能歧視他們，要知道他們也是中華民族的一支，是我們的兄弟，決不能另眼相待。我這話是從那兒說起呢？就從這「倮倮」的「倮」字說起，據本月廿三日本市各報載，一個美籍飛行人員失落緬邊被「猓猓」族充奴役，當時我看見「倮」字竟植以「猓」，啊呀！這足使我傷心！使我非常的傷心！要知這「倮」字如爲「猓」字，便視此等「倮倮」同胞爲畜生類的東西了！要知在從前，「倮」字本寫作「猓」，後來國父昭明民族平等，不許有所歧視，在抗戰前敎部早已命令凡屬犬旁的民族文字，一律改爲人旁。今日還會看到「猓」字，實有糾正的必要。要知他們的人口總數亦不少，內向心是很重的。我們不能繼外蒙古獨立後再失去西南同胞的民心，我們不要以爲微微之事無甚關係，這種歧視是不可以的。　　不過「倮倮」族有二奇異的風俗，一爲以漢人俘虜爲奴僕，一爲以瑛人頭爲祭祀品。故住在西南邊疆的漢族一年中有二個時節均過着提心弔膽的生活，一爲陰曆的五月端午的時節，一爲陰曆的年底；因爲在年底的時候，「倮倮」往往將漢人俘去，做他們的奴隸。且有搶刧漢人的村莊，路刧夜行漢人單身客等事，如爲其虜去，則終身不能外出，勞役而死，且時受虐待，所以此時節的漢人，每人都不免寒心，但還有更寒心的事呢！即在陰曆端午節相近時間，「倮倮」族爲一種迷信所驅，便四出找尋漢人，相遇即殺死帶回家，將其頭斫下，高掛在竹竿上以祭他們種的稻子，而合村的「倮倮人」均出來跪下對人頭拜，謂能保佑他們的稻作豐收，而且所需要的人頭，以有鬍子長髯的尤佳，故有鬍子的漢人更其要當心，否則頭便搬塲。這些是他們的野蠻，是由於敎育不普及的原因，所以我們要開發西南，先要敎育他們，且不能以野蠻與否來決定一個種族的優劣好壞，尤不能有怨恨輕視的心理。　　你不要以爲他們全是野蠻的，要知「倮倮」的婦女是比當地的漢人女子來行漂亮和美麗，但她們不肯嫁與漢人，祗肯漢人男人嫁與她們，因此一般漢人靑年都喜做雄媳婦，不過一入「倮」村便不易歸家。但她們待漢男非常的好，沒有兩樣，祗不過不許回家。我希望我們能盡力爭取「倮倮」同胞！榮得勝  樹高　　甲：「這回榮德生案件，結果是否人財兩全？」　　乙：一非但人財兩全，還因匯奉的調整，美金的高跳，而因此得勝回朝！」改善交通人人有責  高紹聰　　九月九日調整交通後，一般情形已見進步，但距理想尙遠，這裏再嚕囌一下：　　本市肇禍車輛，軍用車多於私用車，因私用車容易尋到追償，且司機工資較大，外快亦多，頗看重飯碗，所以開車者謹愼。軍用車肇禍，交涉困難，故司機胆大亂行，軍人在戰區曠野之處開慣快車，且軍事司機，薪工不大，老手華人旣不肯充任，新手自未有十分把握，故本市司機，必須重新嚴加考騐，合格者照會上蓋印，不合格者吊銷，　　黃燈　　路口紅燈一滅，綠燈即起，路心車輛，尙未走完，橫綫上車子已衝過來。首尾相撞時而有之。如吾人由大世界至西藏路，見綠燈大胆走去。不料行至馬路中間（馬路口甚闊），綠燈已滅換紅燈矣。左右兩面車輛直駛而來，使人進退俱不是。故應在綠燈滅後，繼開黃燈。在黃燈之時，除已到街心者外，一律不許越雷池一步，候已在街心之車走完，再開紅燈，則兩旁車始通行。上海雖已有黃燈設備，但次要路口亦要添設。警察指揮需要三個步驟。　　地洞　　地面坎坷，地穴成洞，三輸車與人力車，恐車胎損壞，不繞右首而前，不料對方來車，以爲我所駛路綫不錯，你不靠右，你自送死。不知此面人力車尙未繞出，碰撞一聲，已肇禍矣。如武定路東端，地穴如鱗，甚至有深至一尺，工務局口口聲聲，在參議會報告無錢，其實這些路如能墊墊平，亦就可以，輕而易舉，所費不大，何不爲耶？　　都市行車速率，除警車外，不能超出二十哩，就是疏處亦應防橫路上衝出車子。上海途中常見有超速）車在行駛，司機以爲有把握，但在千分之一秒中，已　禍矣。車能開入墻壁，衝上行人道，碰斷電桿，此非開車，而是　人騎馬。如張詠春委員夫人及公子，就是犧牲者。　　報告　　本市交通如此紊觀，肇禍不能根絕，人人有性命威脅，人人皆有協助之　，每人可各帶鉛筆和紙，見車肇禍，或速率過度，越規等事，即爲默記車號及當時情形，再書自己姓名住處，投入郵筒，送達有關當局懲辦，並願出而爲證。此非多事，實是熱心市政，愛惜人命的至高美德！犬馬  綸卿　　狗對馬說：「老大哥！你的運氣眞不差，爲了你們「復員」問題，參議員幾乎「舌敝唇焦」；雖然還要請中央「決定」，但是依一般的估計，不過是時日間題而已。何况這玩意兒，人家外國都有。我相信不久的將來，你們一定可以「馳騁自如」，不致有一，馬　徒增老死槽　」之慨。　　馬說：「老弟！你不要誤會，你我是同一性質，同一命運，假使我能够「馳騁自如」，你當然可以「急起直追」；當局絕對不會「厚於此而薄於彼」。我們舉杯慶祝吧！」茶杯里的波浪？  谷沛　　週前香港政府發言人發表談話，似已否認九龍仍爲中國領土。所據之理由是「與英方軍事需要有所牴觸」。又說：「中國官吏在該城的治權，已於一八九九年宣吿中止。」　　其實，這兩點都是毫無理由的。英國割去香港是根據一八四二年的中英南京條約，而南京條約的簽訂，又是由於鴉片戰爭。蔣主席曾經說過：「南京條約是中國第一個國恥」。想不到中英友誼正在希望日趨融協之際，英政府正在採取開明外交的今日，香港政府竟說出這樣的話。　　尤其是勝利後的香港及九龍變作了一個藏汚納垢之所，走私的時有發生，大批漢奸的逃匿，香港政府不但不予制止，而且一直在採取放任政策。本年六月的國民日報事件，是一個例子，大批進口貨物的逃稅，各大公司的遷避香港，又是一個例子。我們不能眼看本國的領土發生這類的事實，尤其不忍再見勝利的河山依然還會受着他人的宰割。　　無論在經濟上，政治上，我們都有充分的理田要求香港九龍立即收回，我們希望政府能採取有效的政策！　　港九問題是否眞的會成爲「茶杯里的波浪？」這要看我們怎樣去爭。雞零狗碎  w·w　　孩子看病號金一草，友人喜事賀敬二草，剜了我的心，然而在一般人　來還是草草不恭。　　老虎灶不收單票，退下來六十元，其中有一張交通三年的伍元鈔，我突覺親熱起來，當年的威風可不小啊！然而鈔老珠黃也不値錢，我又一掬同情之淚。　　偉大的女人是：年齡自十八歲至廿五歲，這八年可以對外抗戰，以後的幾年，成了家，只好向自己人內爭，吵架了。但願明白處境，從此倡隨和好，那麽更顯得眞正的偉大了！連環漫書三毛從軍記　（一一一）  張樂平作新聞人物朱家驊的生平  四維　　現任敎育部長朱家驊先生，上海同濟大學出身，轉入德國柏林大學，獲得哲學博士學位。他和德國有這樣一段親切的歷史關係，也可以說，在朱氏的政治生命中，受到德國的影響很深。　　朱氏是浙江吳興人，他在浙江省黨務常務委員兼浙江省政府民政廳長任內，曾舉辦青年團的訓練，爲中國靑少年訓練組織的創始人。有人說這一種舉措是模德國少年營的組織，並非毫無根據。　　對德國的勸吿　　至朱氏和德國人之間的友誼，可以從他所作「給我的德國朋友」一友，觀察出來：民國二十五年，朱氏曾任中國「中德文化協會」理事長，那時德國正値魔王希特勒　政，飛揚跋扈，朱氏有所感觸，便寫下一篇「忠吿」，原文曾譯登柏林日報，其中有幾句警語，暗寓勸　德人之意，可見朱氏頗有先見。以下是原文：「近年因職務紛繁，與貴國老朋友們很少通信，我在貴國求學多年，所以時常關懷貴國的事情。這幾年來，你們努力復興國家，使我感覺十分欽佩和安慰，但是近來得到種種消息，却把最了解，最信任貴國的我，對於貴國發生了很大的憂慮。………你們要知道，現在這一種不擇手段的急進行爲，雖然可以獲得一時的成就和勝利，但是有遠識的人們，早就替你們擔憂了。……」可是朱氏苦口婆心的說話，對當時的德國人，並沒有發生多大效力。目前，德國已經自食其果，在朱氏固然是感喟不盡，那些讀過朱氏這篇文字的德國人，當也有「侮不當初」之慨。　　舊時代新人物　　朱氏生於舊時代，卻是一位極端的新人物。他批判一個人物的標準，是用「時代化」和「　敗分子」來　分，凡是不合潮流的人，他一概摒棄。　　他對於中國的官僚惡習，尤爲深痛惡絕。在交通部長任內，他曾頒令全國：「各　政府不得拍發官電，須照章繳付全費。」把那些官老爺，價個恨得牙　　的。他又會通令所屬機關各級工作人員，待人接物，務取和平客氣態度，倘有「積習」未除，傲慢無理者，一律嚴辦。他不准部屬搭「官架子」，因爲他自己也是一位沒有官架子的部長。</p>

<h3>Chairman Hosts Government Officials at Banquet; Inquires and Discusses Peace Negotiation Procedures; Marshall Exchanges Views with Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The situation regarding the Nanjing negotiations is still progressing. Except that the CCP delegation is awaiting instructions from Zhou Enlai and Yan'an and has no activities, the government has frequent contact with American personnel and is actively preparing for the talks that may be convened soon. The document that the government plans to issue will be announced within days. Special Envoy Marshall separately received Dong Biwu and Yu Dawei on the afternoon of the 29th, conveyed to Dong Biwu the Chairman's acceptance of the new mediator's suggestions and his hopes for the Communist Party. Dong also raised the issue of a ceasefire for discussion again. Special Envoy Marshall briefly discussed the progress of these conversations with Ambassador Stuart last night.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall visited the Chairman's residence again at 11:00 am on the 30th to meet and exchange views. Marshall and Stuart met briefly at noon. The Chairman then hosted a banquet for government officials Wu Dingchang, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, Hong Lanyou, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Chen Guofu, Bai Chongxi, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Liang Hancao, Wang Yunwu, Peng Xuepei, and other important aides, a total of eighteen people, which was a political banquet attracting attention from all parties. During the banquet, the Chairman inquired about and listened to reports on the progress of peace negotiations and preparations for the National Assembly, and also discussed the procedures for negotiations. From 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Marshall and Stuart met again. At 7:30 pm, the Chairman hosted a banquet for Special Envoy Marshall and his wife. Stuart hosted Wu Dingchang, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Shao Lizi at his residence and then held a meeting to discuss the upcoming talks again.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to invite Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan on the 1st. Regarding the start date of the talks, this reporter inquired at the CCP office on the evening of the 30th. It was stated that it might be decided when Dong Biwu meets with Stuart again on the 1st.</p>
<p>Wu Dingchang and Shao Lizi Discuss: Believe the Situation Will Soon Become Clear</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Ambassador Stuart hosted a banquet on the evening of the 30th. Although the invitation was sent three days ago, the banquet coincided with the day the peace negotiation situation was decided. Therefore, sensitive news reporters waited for news figures at the entrance of the embassy. At 8:10 pm, the first to be surrounded by reporters was Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang. When asked about the content of the talks at today's banquet, he replied: Today's meeting was about the government's agreement on the negotiation method of three-person and five-person groups proceeding simultaneously. It is now only waiting for Zhou Enlai to return to Nanjing. A reporter asked whether the government would wait until the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou before discussing a ceasefire. Wu answered "Yes." In the past, during the ceasefire in the Northeast, some people believed that Changchun must be recovered, and during the ceasefire in Rehe, Chengde and Chifeng must be recovered. In fact, there is absolutely no requirement to recover Zhangjiakou before discussing a ceasefire. Wu is still very optimistic about the future of peace talks. Later, the reporter visited someone who attended the banquet, who said: It has now reached the decision stage of reopening negotiations, so what was discussed today, importantly, was still the procedural issues of peace talks. The government formally agreed to the simultaneous advancement of political and military affairs, and the simultaneous opening of three-person and five-person meetings. This opinion will be formally notified to Dong Biwu by Stuart on the 1st. It is thought that the situation should be clear soon. The government's concessions have gone from insisting on a five-person meeting, to first a five-person meeting and then a three-person meeting, and then to today's simultaneous opening of three-person and five-person meetings. The government's forbearance has reached the final stage, but let's see the Communist Party's final move.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] This reporter interviewed Shao Lizi, who said: The current negotiation situation is gradually becoming clear. The CCP requires a ceasefire as a guarantee for the meeting, that is, a ceasefire as soon as the meeting opens. The government believes that it is appropriate to open a meeting to discuss the ceasefire issue, and hopes that the CCP can submit a list of National Assembly representatives, then military and political issues can be resolved.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Opening Date Approaches; Preparatory Committee Intensifies Work; CCP Sends Letter to Government Refusing to Participate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The deadline for convening the National Assembly is only forty-one days away. According to regulations, the registration date for representatives should be ten days before the meeting. The Preparatory Committee of the Assembly, in view of the urgency of time, does not allow any delay in various preparatory tasks. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou today encouraged all working colleagues to concentrate their efforts to complete various preparatory tasks within one month to meet the needs of the Assembly being convened on schedule, and urged supervisors of various departments and groups to pay close attention to assessment in order to strengthen work efficiency.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The National Assembly is scheduled to open in November this year, and the venue is being actively arranged. The venue will be divided into 400 seats for guests and Chinese and foreign reporters. The venue is equipped with special telephone lines and other equipment for full coverage.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] The CCP delegation has formally notified the government that it refuses to participate in the National Assembly convened on November 12th. According to the CCP's letter, "There is currently no constitution for the National Assembly to discuss, therefore it is inconvenient to participate." It is expected that the Democratic League will also take a consistent stance with the CCP. According to a CCP spokesperson, "It is rumored that if the government insists on convening the National Assembly in Nanjing, the CCP will convene a representative conference in Yan'an or another location in the Liberated Areas. They have not yet received a formal report. But this is also possible."</p>
<h3>Youth Party Hopes All Parties Will Promote National Assembly Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] A spokesperson for the newly established Central Committee of the Chinese Youth Party stated: The National Assembly is about to be convened, and we are willing to contribute our opinions with sincerity as follows: (1) The purpose of the National Assembly is to seek a national consensus to formulate a constitution, lay the foundation for a democratic political system, and complete the great task of national construction as soon as possible. If the meeting causes disputes, it is not the wish of the people. As President Chiang said, "If after we hold the meeting, we cannot promote national unity, nor can we alleviate the suffering of the people, but instead make the national crisis deeper and the suffering of the people greater," then the meaning and value of holding the meeting will be lost. Therefore, we hope that all parties will consider this point, and that at the very least, the atmosphere of the meeting must be free from the smell of gunpowder before anything can be discussed. (2) The date for the National Assembly to be convened on May 5th this year was originally decided by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The postponement was also requested by representatives of the PCC. We still hope that the representatives of the PCC will be responsible for promoting the successful convening of the National Assembly in order to realize democratic politics as soon as possible and comfort the long-awaited hope.</p>

<h3>Li Dijun Conveys Sympathy to Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies; No Political Mission Involved; U.S. Troops in China Solely to Assist in Repatriating Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department. Reporters raised numerous questions to Director He: (Question) Since the victory, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have suffered greatly, with the perpetrators often being minor ethnic groups seeking independence in various regions. Could this be due to our country's lack of strong support for them? Has the foreign affairs authority considered revising its policy? Furthermore, does our negotiation with Indonesia imply recognition of them as a belligerent party? Director He replied: We have always sympathized with the struggles of minor ethnic groups for freedom, and the President has issued proclamations to that effect. However, future actions will depend on their sympathy and response towards us. As for our negotiations with both Dutch and Indonesian sides, it is a practical necessity to protect overseas Chinese and does not imply recognition of Indonesia as a belligerent party. The sympathy mission led by Envoy Li Dijun has absolutely no political mission. However, the results of its on-site observations may provide some reference material for policy making.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' view on the recent "U.S. Troops Get Out of China Week" movement in Shanghai?</p>
<p>(Answer) The stationing of U.S. troops in China was at the invitation of our government and under the command of the Supreme Commander of the China Theater, to assist the Chinese army in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war. They have achieved great merits over the years, and their mission is not yet fully accomplished. Some individuals, with ulterior motives, have launched this movement, which is detrimental to friendship. I consider it highly inappropriate.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the latest development in the Shibuya case? Is our right to jurisdiction over this case, based on the "victim principle," affected by the fact that it is currently being presided over by a U.S. military court?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Shibuya incident is scheduled to be tried in Tokyo on the 30th. The reason it is being handled by the Allied military court is because Tokyo was only under the occupation and control of the U.S. military at the time, and our occupying forces in Japan had not yet arrived. However, we have sent a judge to participate in the trial, representing our country in exercising jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(Question) Is it currently possible to remit money between the Dutch East Indies and China? (Answer) After the end of the war, the Dutch East Indies did not allow the opening of overseas Chinese remittances due to a shortage of foreign exchange, while local overseas Chinese urgently needed to remit funds to China. After consultation between this Ministry and the Ministry of Finance, a remedial measure was agreed upon, and overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies will soon be able to remit funds back to China.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the latest development in the repatriation of engineering corps workers? (Answer) During the war, 1,154 engineering corps workers from various parts of Southeast Asia returned to China to serve. After the end of the war, they urgently needed to be repatriated. After repeated negotiations between this Ministry and the relevant authorities regarding the entry procedures for their return to their original places of residence, permission has been granted, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has also agreed to assist in their repatriation as soon as possible. Our government has also issued each repatriated engineering corps worker US$200 as an encouragement.</p>
<p>He also stated that a cocktail party may be held when the recent Sino-U.S. commercial treaty is signed, inviting reporters to witness the signing of China's first commercial treaty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 30th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference at 3:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department and spokesperson. Li Dijun, the special envoy sent by the National Government to express sympathy to overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, also attended. He and Li made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Remarks by Director He</p>
<p>He first provided a detailed analysis of the recent Bagan Siapi-api incident, and then stated that the principles of our attitude are: (1) Strictly maintain neutrality in the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia, and constantly advise overseas Chinese not to participate in the disputes between the two sides. (2) The protection of the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies should be the responsibility of both the Dutch government and the Indonesian authorities. (3) The Dutch government remains our formal diplomatic counterpart. (4) We have no lack of sympathy for any nation striving for its independence and freedom. However, if actions that harm the lives and property of our local overseas Chinese occur during this struggle for national independence, we will lose all sympathy. (5) Regarding the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia, we hope that both sides can reach a reasonable resolution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Remarks by Envoy Li</p>
<p>Li said: There are over two million overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies, including those born locally, and their economic status is far superior to that of overseas Chinese in other regions. Now, in the aftermath of war, they have suffered great losses. Our government and people deeply sympathize with them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has successively restored all consulates originally stationed in the Dutch East Indies and adopted other measures to maintain stability. Recently, the National Government approved the appointment of myself as a special envoy to convey the Central Government's intentions to the Dutch East Indies, to express commendation for the great contributions of the local overseas Chinese during the war, to express condolences for the losses and suffering they have suffered after the war, and to listen to the opinions of the overseas Chinese and investigate the actual situation, report to the government, and coordinate relief and fundamental solutions. President Chiang will have a message to the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, which I will take with me to convey. This shows the head of state's great concern.</p>
<h3>Our Agreement with UNRRA on Ships Does Not Harm Navigation Rights; Executive Relief Administration Spokesperson Discusses Agreement Contents</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recently, the Executive Yuan approved a supplementary agreement between the Chinese government and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) regarding ships. Some individuals are not clear about the contents of this supplementary agreement. Our reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the Executive Relief Administration to inquire about the truth. The spokesperson stated: "The supplementary agreement on ships recently approved by the Executive Yuan stipulates certain conditions under which UNRRA provides ships to our country. This is completely separate from the case of foreign ships navigating in our inland rivers, which was passed by the Far Eastern Area Committee, and there is no connection whatsoever. The main contents of this supplementary agreement are: (1) All ships provided by UNRRA to China shall fly the Chinese flag; (2) These ships are lent to China for use, and the Chinese government does not pay any price; (3) UNRRA does not require any compensation for damage to the ships during the period of use; (4) If the ships have disputes with third parties during the period of use, the Chinese government is responsible for handling them, and UNRRA is not responsible; (5) During the loan period, the Chinese government may directly operate or entrust shipping companies to operate; (6) Can the loan be renewed after the expiry date? (7) Troops or military supplies may not be carried during the loan period. In summary, it can be seen from the above clauses that the conclusion of this supplementary agreement allows China to obtain the use of some ships without paying any price. The Executive Relief Administration is currently negotiating the terms of the entrusted operation with domestic shipping companies. The above-mentioned supplementary agreement on ships is based on the principle of Article 1, Clause A of the basic agreement signed between UNRRA and the Chinese government in 1945, namely: 'If the materials supplied by UNRRA are equipment for long-term use, a supplementary agreement may be concluded with the Chinese government to retain its ownership, and the equipment will be provided to the Chinese government for use during the effective period of this agreement.' In the past, UNRRA has provided railway locomotives and vehicles to our country and has also concluded similar standby supplementary agreements. As for the case previously passed by the Far Eastern Area Committee of UNRRA allowing foreign ships to navigate in our inland rivers to carry relief materials, our representative Jiang Tingfu has expressed opposition. Although it was passed by a majority of the committee, it has not yet been approved by the UNRRA Central Committee, nor has it been agreed to by the Chinese government. This case has no possibility of being implemented until it is agreed to by the Chinese government. Some individuals have confused this ship supplementary agreement with the previous proposal of the Far Eastern Area Committee, which is ignorant of the facts, because the former is that our country obtains the use of ships without paying a price, which is completely different from the meaning of the proposal of the Far Eastern Area Committee," he said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also said: As for the reason why Chennault's air transport team has been unable to start flying for so long, the spokesperson declined to provide an explanation, only saying: Chennault's air transport team is an independent organization and is not part of the Executive Relief Administration, so the Executive Relief Administration has no obligation to provide an explanation on its behalf.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Representatives Petition in Nanjing; Suggest Government Improve Economic Policies; Pan Xulun Speaks of Strictly Implementing Import-Export Chains</h3>
<p>[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] Xu Jiqing, Luo Qinghua, and Xu Guomao, representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation, arrived in Nanking successively on the 30th, and other representatives will arrive in turn. It is heard that the petition delegation will stay in Nanking for two or three days and will petition to the Executive Yuan, the Supreme National Defense Council, and other agencies, and will return to Shanghai after being received by the President.</p>
<p>[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] Luo Qinghua, a representative of the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation, told reporters on the 30th that the main purpose of the delegation's visit was to suggest to the government that it comprehensively improve its financial and economic policies so that the economy, which is on the verge of collapse, can be restored. It is said that a year has passed since the victory, but the government is still implementing wartime economic policies, which greatly hinders economic recovery. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can quickly place its economic policies on a peacetime footing, change the past policy of contracting credit and inflating currency, and vigorously expand credit and contract currency to support industry and encourage exports.</p>
<p>[Our Nanking Correspondent, 30th] Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, told our reporter on the 30th: Many of the points suggested in the telegrams sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation to various government agencies are already being implemented by the government. In terms of international trade, the recent import and export figures have gradually approached each other, and subsidy policies are also in progress. The implementation of the import-export chain system was previously proposed by the industrial and commercial community's petition delegation, but there are differing opinions from all parties, and implementation may be difficult. As for the method of barter trade, the government is also carrying it out. The Soviet Union, Siam, and some South American countries are exchanging goods with us. Regarding the use of economic diplomacy, we have sent many representatives to attend the upcoming international trade conference in the United Kingdom, and other aspects are also being noted.</p>
<p>Pan also said: The establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Supervision Office is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. According to relevant sources, the local Industrial and Commercial Supervision Offices can be established successively in mid-October.</p>

<h3>Female Workers Beat Up Manager in Wuxi Silk Factory Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 30th] Strikes in silk factories in this county have occurred repeatedly, which is a serious problem in society. If it is not resolved quickly, it may affect local security. This morning, Chen Wanxiang, the manager of Zhenlun Silk Factory in Nanmen, was beaten up by female workers again. Afterwards, the responsible police station went to suppress the unrest and arrested seven female workers who caused the trouble and sent them to the county for interrogation. Due to the seriousness of the situation, the Silk Factory Association convened an emergency meeting at 10:00 AM to discuss countermeasures. Commissioner Xu of the Social Affairs Department and the county government attended the meeting to persuade them to order all factories to start work at 1:00 PM, and those workers who did not arrive would be dismissed. Meanwhile, troops were assigned to garrison in various factories to maintain order and protect them. Later, Commissioner Xu and others went to the Industrial Workers' Union to persuade the female workers to resume work, and the wage issue would be negotiated and resolved after work resumed. However, only half of the female workers obeyed the order and went to work in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Notorious Bandit Tian Xiushan Under Joint Trial in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 30th] Tian Xiushan, the "Tiger of Eastern Zhejiang," also known as the notorious Tian Huzi, was captured by the Security Command. The people have long awaited a public trial. Today, he was jointly tried by Shen Honglie, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, who also served as the Security Commander, and Vice Commander Zhu. Tian stubbornly defended his many evil crimes such as robbery, rape, and arson, admitting only a part of them. However, according to our reporter's investigation, even based on the crimes he has admitted, it is sufficient to sentence him to the death penalty. After this joint trial, the results will be reported to the Central Government, and the final judgment will await the approval and announcement of the Central Government.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Reports on the Work of the Northeast Economic Commission in Shenyang; Elucidates Future Measures in Detail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Northeast Economic Commission, recently gave a speech on the work of the Economic Commission since May and the measures to be taken in the future, stating that the Commission immediately began to rebuild the Northeast's economic order after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. (1) The restoration of transportation and communications. Today, the railways, postal services, telegraphs, and telephones between Shenyang, Changchun, Dehui, Jilin, and other cities and Pingjin within the Guan (Shanhai Pass) have been restored. (2) The establishment of financial institutions. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Trust Bureau have all decided to establish branches in various cities. (3) The stabilization of the currency system. After the consolidation of stamped legal tender and Red Army notes, circulating coupons have become the main currency. Since the opening of commercial remittances, their position has become even more stable. (4) The distribution of enemy and puppet factories. Based on their nature, they were divided into central direct operation, local government operation, Production Bureau operation, or private operation, and the distribution work is almost complete. As for the future, it has been decided to carry out: (A) Those mainly led by the central government include: (1) Improving railway transportation, such as enhancing commercial transportation between various parts of the Northeast and within and outside the Guan. (2) Building a financial network. National and private banks should develop simultaneously, dividing labor and cooperating. The plan can be implemented after government approval. (3) The recovery of industry. In terms of heavy industry, a plan has been agreed upon with Director Qian Changzhao of the Resources Commission and can be implemented next month, with possible restoration and suitability to needs as the criteria for restoration. Light industry can be started separately after sufficient electricity is available, but there are too many units, making progress more difficult. (4) Strengthening the supply of materials. Prices are generally soaring, making stabilization difficult, but materials must be distributed reasonably and fairly. Coal distribution has already begun, and flour is also being prepared. Cloth is the most difficult to obtain in the Northeast, and it is currently being purchased and transported in batches from within the Guan. The Liaoyang and Yingkou textile factories received by the China Textile Corporation have already started production. (B) Those mainly led by local governments: (1) Consider establishing county banks. In the past, the establishment of provincial banks in various provinces did not achieve results due to a lack of planning. Now it is planned to establish them simultaneously in the counties of the recovered provinces, with supervisory agencies in each province and a regulatory agency in the Northeast. (2) Universally establish rural cooperatives to promote improved agriculture, guide cultivation, and issue strict loans. In addition, plans are being prepared to increase production and improve collective production methods, so that agricultural products can be sold through convenient channels at reasonable prices, reducing the suffering of farmers, and establishing state granaries to purchase and store food at market prices in order to stabilize high food prices. However, all plans rely on the establishment of local order and the guarantee of security.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] The Northeast Economic Department's Commissioner's Office officially closed on the 30th, and the Resources Commission took over the various industrial and mining enterprises it had received.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Northeast Postal Rates Takes Effect Today</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Correspondent, 29th] The postal rates in the Northeast will be adjusted starting from the first of next month. Xiao Jingyi, Director of the Jilin Postal Administration, said at a press conference last night that the temporary method of charging postal rates in the Northeast was decided by the Northeast Executive Council's Economic Commission this spring, charging five times the Manchukuo postal rates. Adjustments have been proposed repeatedly, but they have been delayed due to the situation. Recently, the central government decided to adopt a consistent method of charging postal rates with the Guan (Shanhai Pass), and the ratio of legal tender to circulating coupons is still 1 to 13. The conversion and odd numbers are rounded off to the nearest whole number, so the adjusted postal rate is two yuan for a regular letter, and the rate for books and printed matter remains 5 jiao per hundred grams. Xiao continued, saying that the purpose of this adjustment of postal rates is to unify postal rates, not to increase prices. Finally, Xiao said that only 600,000 letters were sent from Jilin in August.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Labor Relief Commission Established</h3>
<p>Method for Allocating Flour Decided</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 30th] In order to facilitate the promotion of relief work, the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Relief Administration, together with the relevant departments of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, established a Labor Relief Commission, which was officially established this afternoon, the 30th. It was resolved that the allocation of relief flour in Zhejiang Province would be as follows: 10,000 tons for large-scale water conservancy labor relief, 3,000 tons for small-scale water conservancy, 3,000 tons for repairing national highways, 1,000 tons for repairing county roads, 1,000 tons for repairing destroyed houses, and 3,000 tons for afforestation, totaling 21,000 tons. To avoid transportation difficulties, it was decided to allocate this flour and the provincial food bureau to offset the grain tax in order to save transportation costs and time.</p>

<h3>New York Herald Tribune Editorial: The So-Called "U.S. Troops Out of China Week" Only Seeks to Strengthen American Isolationist Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 29th] The New York Herald Tribune recently published an editorial criticizing certain factions in China for initiating a "U.S. Troops Out of China Week." It stated: This movement, initiated by the American Communist Party and its supporters, and supported by a few misguided liberals, can be summed up in one sentence: If U.S. troops withdraw from China, the Soviet Union will take over, and that's all there is to it. The pretext of this movement is none other than to strengthen America's isolationist policy. What we are concerned about is that the Chinese government is greatly encouraging this Communist movement. Why do we say this? Because every action of a small number of officials in the Kuomintang, every ban on free speech, and every failure to fulfill democratic promises are fully exploited by the Communist Party as propaganda material.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Advocating for "Contributing Schools" as Birthday Greetings</h3>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, our government immediately announced that "Education Comes First" during the period of national reconstruction, which demonstrates the government's emphasis on education. However, in the past year, the nation has faced many misfortunes, hindering the smooth progress of demobilization work according to plan. The present situation is chaotic, and construction has not yet begun. Even education, which is ranked first in importance, has not achieved significant progress. Let alone higher education and specialized education, even basic national education still has a significant illiteracy rate. During the War of Resistance, educational institutions suffered severe destruction from the enemy and had to relocate inland with the government. The facilities in the rear were much simpler than before the war. Once victory arrived, the hurried demobilization and the lack of transportation made it difficult for faculty and students to move east. Furthermore, relocating schools back to their original sites proved extremely challenging. Moreover, most of the original school sites were damaged by the enemy and rendered unusable, requiring significant funds for reconstruction. Therefore, in the year since the victory, local education authorities have only been able to focus on educational rehabilitation and have been unable to spare resources for the plan to establish more national schools to popularize education. As a result, a large number of children are excluded from national schools and cannot enjoy their right to compulsory education. The education authorities are well aware that this is a shameful phenomenon, but they are constrained by economic limitations and cannot "cook without rice," so they have no choice but to stand idly by, letting things drift. People in the education and cultural circles are all deeply concerned about this crisis facing education in our country.</p>
<p>"It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people." Education is a century-long plan for the nation. Therefore, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly exhorted the people of the country to prioritize "Education First." Imagine that in the future, China must strive for democratization in politics, industrialization in economics, and modernization in the military. To achieve these three goals, the popularization of education is an urgent prerequisite. Democratic politics is based on universal suffrage, and the thoroughness of universal suffrage is a measure of the degree of democracy. Today, citizens eligible to vote must not only understand their personal interests but also have a clear understanding of the domestic and international situation. How can we expect someone who has not completed elementary school to vote correctly? Regarding economic industrialization and military modernization, how can we expect a worker, a farmer, or a soldier who has not graduated from national school to become a sound worker, a farmer who can use machinery, or a soldier who can use modern weapons?</p>
<p>When the Shanghai Municipal Council recently met to discuss education-related plans, councilors strongly advocated for national education, arguing that the Municipal Education Bureau should weigh the priorities and concentrate all its efforts on popularizing national education, while temporarily postponing other superficial matters. This shows their ability to see the bigger picture. We believe that the popularization of education is related to the major plan of national construction and the interests of the majority of the people. It is not just a matter for Shanghai, but a task that the entire country must resolve to complete in the shortest possible time. This year marks Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday, which is approaching rapidly. The Chairman led the revolutionary Northern Expedition and then led the War of Resistance against Japan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Representatives Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The current economic malady can be simply summarized in one word: "high." High interest rates, high labor costs, high shipping fees, high taxes, high prices, and a high volume of banknotes are all widely recognized facts.</p>
<p>How can we lower these high levels and rescue the economic crisis? We must study this issue from both its symptoms and its root causes. Fundamentally, we must restrict the amount of currency issued and contract it, so that prices, taxes, costs, and so on can be gradually reduced. However, this is closely related to politics. If the political ailments cannot be thoroughly cured, then demanding currency contraction and the return of legal tender to the treasury may be like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.</p>
<p>There are many remedies for the symptoms. The suggestions made by the previous Shanghai business and industry delegation and those brought by the current Shanghai Municipal Council delegation, broadly speaking, are all timely and meritorious achievements that will be immortalized in the modern history of our country. All Chinese people, rejoicing at this auspicious occasion, would like to offer him a toast. However, during the period of national reconstruction, hardships and difficulties are even greater than during wartime. The entire nation should practice frugality, bury themselves in the work of national construction, and not retreat in the slightest. Moreover, the Chairman is known for his frugality and simplicity, and we should not go against his wishes. Recently, more than ten people from the Shanghai education and cultural circles have initiated the "Contributing Schools" method to celebrate his birthday. Nanjing, Hankou, and other places have responded enthusiastically. This initiative aims to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday on the one hand, and to open up a new avenue for popularizing education on the other, achieving two goals at once. We fully agree with this in principle and hope that the people of the country will respond enthusiastically and donate funds voluntarily, so that we can achieve the goal of at least one school per town or one school per district. If this becomes a national trend, then ten years later, when Chairman Chiang celebrates his seventieth birthday, how many millions of out-of-school children will benefit from the "Contributing Schools" campaign? These are our new generation, the future masters of the nation, and the place where we place our hopes. The nation and society have a duty to ensure that these new generations have the opportunity to enjoy education. Even the Chairman himself should tacitly approve of this tax-raising method for popularizing education and be optimistic about its success. The disadvantages are obvious. What we want to suggest to the representatives of the Municipal Council is not to add more methods, but to make sincere statements and arouse the sincere understanding of the authorities, and not just to engage in formalities.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen said: "Knowing is easy, acting is difficult." This is indeed true. Any difficult problem, as long as it is truly understood, will always have a solution and the power to overcome it. The eight-year War of Resistance was finally won because of the genuine understanding of the people and the government. We do not believe that if the government truly understood the pain of the people and the crisis facing business and industry, it would be at a loss and unable to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>If we were to say that the authorities do not understand the current economic crisis, that would be a gross accusation. We believe that this time the representatives' request will surely receive the sympathy, acceptance, consideration, research, and even separate implementation of the authorities. There is no doubt about this. The question is: To what extent will they sympathize? How will they handle the acceptance? What will be the result of the consideration and research? Will the efforts to implement it only be efforts in name only? Will the implementation be serious and thorough? These are the questions that remain.</p>
<p>Take the issue of commodity prices, for example. Whether it is the central government or the local government, which authority is not shouting about suppressing prices? Which competent authority is not implementing the policy of suppressing prices? Unfortunately, while they are suppressing prices, prices continue to rise, as if they can coexist and operate independently. If you were to ask them, you would surely get the answer: "There is no perfect solution." It is true that there is no perfect solution, but to have exhausted one's wisdom and ability and still be unable to come up with a perfect solution is probably not true!</p>
<p>Upon careful examination, we feel that this kind of superficial attitude is not so much due to the difficulty of implementation as to insufficient understanding and excessive adherence to fixed ideas. Because of insufficient understanding, they deal with matters perfunctorily, focusing only on superficial embellishments. In the end, they excel at deceiving people. Because of excessive adherence to fixed ideas, they are prejudiced and stubborn, and their minds are narrow, making it impossible for them to accept the opinions of others. The result is that any policy is implemented half-heartedly, and they believe that this half-hearted policy is just right. In any case, they are unwilling to make any amendments, let alone changes or modifications. The Shanghai Municipal Council's petitioning representatives are in Nanjing this morning to present their case to the highest authorities and competent officials. We believe that they represent not only the Municipal Council, nor only the business and industry community, but also all 4.5 million citizens of Shanghai. Their opinions may be the wishes of the people of the entire nation. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will pay attention to their appeals. On the other hand, we hope that the petitioning representatives will make their greatest efforts to awaken the authorities' genuine understanding of the current economic crisis. "Knowing is easy, acting is difficult!" This is Sun Yat-sen's legacy. If the authorities truly know that the crisis is imminent, how can there be no reason to adopt measures to resolve the crisis?</p>

<h3>Seagull Gunboat Flees After Smuggling, Two Lighters Carrying Goods Captured Outside Zhanjiang, Guangzhou Thoroughly Investigates Case of Military Supplies Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch, 30th] Wu Qushi, Director of the Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, which is affiliated to the Naval Ordnance Department, is accused of embezzling a large batch of shipbuilding machinery worth over ten million yuan.

Recently, the Naval Commissioner's office received an urgent telegram from Naval Headquarters ordering a swift investigation into the ship's whereabouts and ordering the arrest of the ship's captain, Xu Xianfen, for further investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>[Guangzhou News] The warship "Seagull" often patrolled the sea surface after the victory, traveling between Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, and other places. Later, it was widely rumored that the Seagull often transported large quantities of smuggled goods. In May of this year, a minor conflict occurred on the sea near Zhujiang City with the garrison troops. It was not until the garrison troops were transferred that the Seagull dared to return. When the Seagull arrived in Zhujiang City, on the morning of September 17th, someone hired civilian ships for a high price in Xiying to transport goods outside the port. After Customs learned of this, they mobilized all armed customs police and, together with local military and police, monitored the waterway between Xiying and Chikan. At around 2:00 AM, two cargo ships silently sailed into the waters of Xiying. The customs police shouted a warning, and the cargo ships, caught off guard, surrendered. An inspection revealed that the two ships were carrying over four hundred items of smuggled goods, worth over 80 million yuan. Three naval soldiers were found on board. Customs, together with military and police authorities, are strictly investigating this case.</p>
<p>[Guangzhou News] Previously, Mo Yushi, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Military Affairs, had not completed the procedures for receiving enemy and puppet military supplies and for cleaning up after the withdrawal. The Investigation Team found many suspicious points and requested instructions from the Ministry of National Defense via telegram. Mr. Mo has returned to Guangzhou from Nanjing, and Director Zhang Fakui ordered him to complete all the procedures as soon as possible. Although Mr. Mo was specially allowed to reside in the cleanup office, a squad of military police was stationed to guard him. After arriving in Guangzhou, Mr. Mo visited Yang, the head of the Investigation Team, and openly received reporters, expressing that he would not shirk any responsibility. However, during the receiving process, there were many complexities, and some procedures may not have been completed. He will expedite the completion of each item. Regarding the rumors that the 173 boxes of special drugs contained opium and narcotics, he hopes that the Investigation Team will thoroughly investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Refugees in Xuyi Endure Intolerable Suffering, Armed Advance to Reclaim Homeland, Communist Troops Defeated Before the True Power of the People</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Mingguang News] Xuyi County, Anhui Province, borders Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. It was invaded by communist troops in 1939, who used it as their base in the Huainan region. The people were brutally murdered, and they fled in large numbers. Last month, communist troops launched an offensive and harassed the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. National troops were forced to counterattack, and all the towns and villages in the county have been successively recovered, except for the towns and villages in the old Third District in the western part of the county, which are still occupied by communist troops. The refugees who fled the area, unable to endure the suffering of displacement, voluntarily organized a "Patriotic People's Return Home Corps." On September 9th, the organization was completed, and it was reported to the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, the Provincial Security Command, the Commissioner's Office, the County Government, and other agencies for record. It stated: "Since the Japanese invaders started the war, the Central Plains have been in turmoil. In 1938, the government moved west, and the entire southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway fell into enemy hands. Although all of Xuyi was isolated behind enemy lines, the people still united and fought the enemy with arms, making desperate efforts. Government laws and regulations could still be implemented as before. Xuyi City was twice occupied and recovered by local armed forces, making a glorious contribution to the history of national self-defense. Unexpectedly, communist troops took the opportunity to invade in the spring of 1939. Under the guise of unified resistance against Japan, they secretly expanded their army and seized territory. Local people, out of respect for national righteousness, feared hindering the great cause of resistance and national construction, and had no choice but to endure the suffering. Communist troops were able to develop leisurely and grow stronger day by day. First, they confiscated the people's arms and destroyed the administrative organization. Then, they arrested and killed intellectuals and wealthy families. Their insidious, treacherous, and cruel methods knew no bounds. All the ethical codes and moral principles of our five thousand years of history were destroyed without exception. The local people, except for those who had been brutally murdered or coerced, had mostly fled. Time flies, and eight years have passed. Our refugee compatriots have been exposed to the elements and have suffered from hunger and cold and the spread of epidemics. The old and weak have died in ditches, while the strong have become emaciated. The living have nothing to eat, and the dead have nothing to be buried with. Wives and children are separated, and the tragedy is unbearable. After the victory, the communist troops not only did not repent but intensified their brutal killings to eliminate their so-called middle class, forcing innocent people to serve in the front lines and transport supplies. Even poor families had no choice but to embark on the path of exile. Who does not have parents? Who does not have a wife and children? At this time of life and death separation, how can they not shed tears? The ancestors' tombs are all in their homeland. After the first anniversary of the victory, when the world is celebrating, they are still forced to wander and be displaced. With their hometown in sight, they have no tears to shed. Therefore, on September 5th, they convened a meeting of refugee patriots and decided to organize the Xuyi County West Third District Patriotic People's Return Home Corps, and publicly appointed the current Deputy Speaker of the County Council, Kan Jimin, as the commander, and Zhou Aimen and Fu Xuewu as the brigade commanders. The seven towns and villages in the West Third District were divided into seven companies, subordinate to the two brigades. The company commander positions were concurrently held by the current town and village chiefs. The organization was established immediately, and they pledged to enter the territory, vowing not to coexist with the communist bandits who exterminate humanity. Once they enter the territory and the basic government can be promoted, they will incorporate all their arms into the normal organization of the government, and the name of the "Return Home Corps" will be announced for cancellation.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Xuyi County West Third District Patriotic People's Return Home Corps set out from Sangji Township (35 li east of Mingguang) on September 10th. On the same day, they arrived at Liangshan. On the 11th, they headed towards Gupai, the base of the communist troops in the three counties of Xuyi, Fengyang, and Jiashan. They engaged in battle with the communist troops' independent battalion. The patriotic people, fueled by years of resentment, were each worth a hundred men. After a fierce battle, the communist troops were defeated and retreated, capturing many military supplies and documents. They then conducted searches in nearby villages. On the 19th, they advanced north again. Communist troops set up ambushes at Yinjiqiao, Wawu, Zhao, and other places, attacking from two directions. We bravely attacked, and the communist troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated in two directions. We also divided our troops to pursue and search the recovered areas. On the 22nd, communist troops built fortifications in the Dagukou area, relying on the terrain to resist stubbornly. After four hours of fierce fighting, we finally broke through the communist fortifications, and the communist troops fled in panic towards Huaibei. We sank five of their boats, killed more than forty communist troops, captured several alive, and seized one rifle and several hand grenades. The number of drowned and dead is still difficult to estimate. Only one of our people was injured.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's Hangzhou News] Xie Renshou, an employee of the Xinpu Post Office, has a hen that recently hatched fourteen chicks. One of the yellow-feathered chicks, just four days after hatching, crows loudly like a rooster. This abnormality is worthy of research by zoologists.</p>
<h3>Changshu, Taicang, and Kunshan Launch Suppression Campaign, Unifying Party-Government-Group, Strengthening Propaganda</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Changshu News] This area is located near the river, and the suppression campaign is about to begin. This county discovered bandit traces and was severely punished for poor transportation. Security measures have been established: (1) Unify the party, government, and groups, organize a propaganda team, go deep into the people, and be responsible for promoting national policies, so that every citizen will automatically assist the government in promoting security matters.

<p>[Another News] The county government received an order from the province: Regarding Article 16 of the "Regulations on the Implementation of the Baojia System," which does not provide detailed regulations for temples, ancestral halls, churches, guild halls, etc., in the Baojia, the method of investigation should be consistent across the board. However, monks and Taoists are often not noticed, and are allowed to come and go as they please without reporting household registration changes. Temple abbots also only rely on the ordination certificate to accommodate them without investigation, making it easy for traitors to mingle. It is now ordered to conduct a thorough investigation in conjunction with the local Buddhist Association and Taoist Association. In the future, the movements of monks and Taoists must be reported in accordance with changes in registration, and it must be implemented effectively.</p>
<p>[Another News] The suppression campaign is about to begin here. Deputy Commander Guo of the Paratrooper Brigade, County Magistrate Pan, Secretary Zhao, and others are scheduled to jointly inspect the eastern villages and the Kunshan-Taicang border on the first day, providing guidance in person.</p>
<p>[Another News] Changyinsha in the Fifth District of Nantong County is adjacent to the Seventh District of this county. The provincial government previously ordered it to be placed under the jurisdiction of this county. County Magistrate Pan Yichen was ordered to go and take over, but the local people organized groups to oppose the takeover and even made a declaration to risk bloodshed. This matter has now been resolved. The provincial government sent another telegram to County Magistrate Yang of Nantong, ordering him to hand over the area to this county within a specified time and ordering this county to quickly take over. According to a telegram from the provincial government to various sectors, the current placement is necessary for unified military command, and the affiliation will be determined again after the end of military operations.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Kunshan News] Liu Zheng, Commander of the Fourth Brigade of the Paratrooper Corps, was appointed as the Commander of the First Suppression District of Yangcheng Lake.

During the meetings, Mr. Liu provided detailed instructions on the suppression matters and then conducted thorough discussions, which resulted in the following decisions: (1) Thoroughly achieve the unification of party and government, (2) Report as much as possible on traitors and Baojia chiefs and people who collude with and harbor bandits, (3) Reorganize the Baojia, (4) Reorganize the self-defense forces, (5) Investigate the number of eligible young men and the number of people in various occupations.</p>
<h3>Tragedy in Jiujiang: Returning Soldier Beaten to Death, Incident Occurs in Front of Cinema, Fortunately Averting Major Accident</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Jiujiang dispatch, 30th] At 7:00 PM on the 29th, a tragic incident occurred in front of the Jiujiang Youth Cinema, in which a returning soldier was beaten to death. According to investigation, eight people were killed or injured on the spot.

<p>Nazi War Criminal Sketches (Special Translation by this Newspaper's Editorial Department)</p>
<p>Göring</p>
<p>He was the Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force and a chief administrator in the Nazi organization. Initially, his stubborn personality and abundant capabilities seemed to be swaying the court; however, after hearing many of his legendary statements being thoroughly attacked by other defendants, he had to calm down. Schacht described him as a Roman tyrant who dyed his toenails and wore jewels on his hands, and as Judge Jackson read this passage aloud, he requested morphine from the court but did not receive it. Göring's defense was as follows: he claimed to be loyal to Hitler, a faithful but misguided second-in-command of the Nazis. Regarding the allegation that the German Air Force used humans for experiments in an attempt to improve itself, he insisted he had no knowledge of it.</p>
<p>Hess</p>
<p>He was Hitler's designated successor, who once flew to England and was detained there until the end of the war. After returning to Germany, he said he had lost all memory. The court said his amnesia was feigned, arousing great suspicion among the public. He refused to defend himself, and his lawyer said Hess was insane. He was pale, with wide eyes, as if having little interest in the trial. In court, his stomach often convulsed, causing him to bend over and arch his back. He refused to take medication, fearing he would be poisoned.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop</p>
<p>This very elegant Nazi Foreign Minister seemed to have the worst physical and mental condition. His former uniform, covered with medals, has been replaced by civilian clothing, his hair has turned white, and his complexion is gray. When Göring attacked him, he occasionally attempted to smile, but even smiling seemed very difficult. In the final debate, Sir Shawcross called him an "assassin," and he staggered forward, wanting to defend himself, but almost fell to the ground. The court accused him of preparing the path for Hitler's aggression, and his response was that he had only told some "diplomatic lies."</p>
<p>Keitel</p>
<p>Although the insignia on his green army uniform had been removed, his handsome profile and neat mustache made him look like a benevolent grandfather. When Sir Hartley described the atrocities committed by the German army against Jewish populations in Poland and the Soviet Union, he cried out. His defense was similar to that of ordinary soldiers, that he was only following Hitler's orders. His lawyer admitted that Keitel knew he had committed serious crimes, and largely admitted the points indicated in the indictment. He said he opposed the invasion of the Soviet Union and repeatedly sought to resign but was not permitted.</p>
<p>Streicher</p>
<p>This figure, known for his anti-Semitism, claimed to be the first person in the world to advocate for Jewish restoration. He said his anti-Semitic plan was only aimed at establishing a homeland for Jews in Madagascar. This man, with silver-white hair and a face shaped like an ax, told the court that he ordered the demolition of the Nuremberg synagogue only because it was incompatible with the city's ancient Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>Funk</p>
<p>This former German Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank often said he was a very sick old man, but he never missed a single session. He was one of the earliest Nazis, but he said he was an insignificant person. The point he argued most fiercely was that he said he did not know that the German guards had taken the gold teeth from the bodies of Jewish women killed in concentration camps and deposited them in the Reichsbank.</p>
<p>Schacht</p>
<p>This once internationally renowned banker and economist constantly expressed indignation at being tried alongside other war criminals. He had taken various radical economic measures to implement Germany's rearmament, but he said he had tried to stop Hitler since 1938. His sole defender, Sevius, came from Switzerland and testified that Schacht had led the July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler. Judge Jackson specifically attacked him once during the final trial, saying that he would never participate in a movement unless its success was fully guaranteed, and would flee as soon as there were signs of failure.</p>
<p>Dönitz</p>
<p>Hitler had chosen him to be the head of the last Nazi government, but he himself said that he was a person completely without political ambition. He considered himself to have adhered to the rules of war during the submarine warfare. His defense lawyer presented an affidavit from Nimitz, which stated that the United States ordered the launch of unrestricted submarine warfare after the Pearl Harbor attack. Dönitz vehemently denied that he had ever planned a war of aggression.</p>
<p>Raeder</p>
<p>This 70-year-old naval chief believed that Germany's rearmament, in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles, was purely defensive in nature and said he had no knowledge of any war of aggression. Raeder admitted that as early as October 1939, he had suggested an attack on Britain, but he said his purpose was only to prevent Britain and France from preemptively striking.</p>
<p>Papen</p>
<p>Although he had gone through nine months of lengthy trials, this diplomat, known for plotting since the First World War, remained very elegant. He spoke to the court as casually as he would to people in a club, talking endlessly about how difficult it was to conduct diplomacy under Hitler and that it was impossible to stop him. He said that he took office for Hitler only to reform him with responsibility. He even said that he had participated in the plot to assassinate Hitler.</p>
<p>Danube River Free Navigation; Conference Passes Compromise Plan</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Invites Various Industries to Discuss Price Stabilization Issues; Cotton Cloth and Woolen Goods Create a Situation of Scarcity; Decision to Organize a Price Review Committee</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu, in view of the recent dramatic price fluctuations, specially invited representatives of the directors and supervisors of various trade associations in the city to hold a discussion yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Those present included Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association; Qu Zhenhua of the Rice Dealers' Association; Xie Hengzong of the Coal Industry Association; Zheng Yitong of the Sugar Industry Association; Fu Changyu of the Grains, Oil Cakes, and Bran Association; Tong Feiyang of the Woolen Goods Association; Wu Weijing of the China Textile Corporation; Xian Zhunian of the Flour and Bran Association; Fei Yuansong of the Rayon Association; Cha Zesan of the Grains and Rice Sales Association; Qiu Mingshen of the North Goods Association; Yu Pinru of the South Goods Association; Zhang Shouren of the Vegetable Association; Yang Liren of the Woolen Textile Industry Association; Zhou Jiasheng of the Yarn Merchants Association; Zhu Zhigao of the Fresh Meat Industry Association; Han Jingquan of the Cooked Water Industry Association; Dong Jiuhui of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association; Zhang Wenkui of the Department Store Association; Zhan Jiansheng of the Gold Industry Association; Shi Zhidang of the New Medicine Industry Association; Liu Gongyun of the Enemy and Puppet Assets Processing Bureau; and Xu Letian of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting and briefly stated: The reason for convening everyone today is because there have been many fluctuations in market prices recently, so I hope that representatives of the trade associations can accurately review how to make them tend to balance. It should be particularly pointed out that the price of rice, which is the mainstay of the people's food, has not risen at present. The flour industry has also stipulated that its price is 14,000 yuan per dan, but now it has risen to 17,000 yuan, and the authorities are trying to stabilize it. The government can directly allocate 70% of the total amount of edible oil needed by the city, and there is no possibility of price increases. Therefore, in recent days, the price of deep-fried dough sticks, which are the greatest threat to people's livelihood, has doubled, which is really unreasonable and must be banned to stabilize people's livelihood. Secondly, the price of cloth and cotton yarn has also risen recently, which has a direct impact on the lives of ordinary people. We must pay attention to whether there is any corruption or uneven distribution during allocation. Also, the vegetable industry</p>

<p>General Cooke Explains the Mission of the U.S. Military in China to Reporters</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] General Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday and are scheduled to return to Qingdao today. General Cooke received local reporters at the Cathay Hotel at 2:30 PM yesterday. General Cooke reiterated the mission of the U.S. military in China, which is to assist China in completing its surrender work, such as repatriating Japanese troops, and to assist China in its construction work after more than eight years of arduous resistance. This is purely a transitional period. Our purpose is to help China become a strong country in the international arena. The Military Mediation Department Executive Group established in Beiping is also a major task in this mission. U.S. troops have a road protection team stationed on the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao railway line to maintain traffic and transmit telecommunications between Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. However, this work can be difficult at times, and we are always concerned.</p>
<p>General Cooke then answered several written inquiries. To date, the U.S. Navy has assisted in the transportation of approximately 250,000 Chinese troops. The last time Chinese troops were transported was in June. In January of this year, it also assisted in transporting Communist troops from Hong Kong and Guangzhou to Yantai and other places.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao and Qinhuangdao has reduced and demobilized two divisions. The main task of the Marine Corps at present is to maintain the transportation of the Military Mediation Department Executive Group and train the Chinese Navy. The number of Chinese Navy personnel being trained varies from time to time, totaling 545 people. The training courses are all basic, such as mechanics, radio, and surveying. The ships donated by the U.S. Navy not only belong entirely to the Chinese Navy, but also to the UNRRA's various Chinese shipping companies and the Maritime Customs. The 1,000 Chinese naval students trained in Miami, USA, sailed back this time with two aircraft carrier escorts and two destroyers. The U.S. donated four medium landing ships, five army landing ships, seven amphibious tanks, and thirty small boats to the Chinese Navy. Five landing ships, fifteen medium landing ships, eight small landing ships, and five port auxiliary boats were handed over to Chinese shipping merchants. UNRRA also received sixteen medium landing ships, twenty landing ships, five destroyer escorts, and one hundred and twenty-three small boats. The Customs also received eight minesweepers, six small minesweepers, two army landing ships, and about twenty other ships.</p>
<p>Finally, General Cooke stated that the U.S. naval vessels will be gradually withdrawn to Qingdao or returned to the United States, but Qingdao "is not a U.S. naval base," and the flagship of the Seventh Fleet will remain stationed in Qingdao.</p>
<p>There is always a surge in prices during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but in the past, prices would always fall back after September. This year, the prices are rising without falling, which is an exception. In addition, the coal industry is allocated by the Central Fuel Management Committee, and the official price has not risen. Why is the black market price so high? The municipal government can take appropriate measures to stabilize prices. However, when there is a simple path to follow, we do not intend to use pressure. We hope that various trade associations can automatically assist the government and not increase the difficulty of governance. Today's meeting is a symposium to find out the reasons for price increases in various industries and jointly review them to find a solution.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Gu Zhunian, Chairman of the Flour Industry Association, stated the reasons for the price increase, saying: There are more than 70 member companies in the trade association that can be allocated flour, and another 100 or so small stores are allocated. Among them, the maximum amount allocated is 50 or 60 bags, and the minimum amount is 20 or 30 bags, while the monthly sales volume is 15,000 or 16,000 bags, so the actual supply is not enough for the market. The government had a one-year tax exemption plan, and now the tax exemption period expires in September. Starting today, a 15 per cent business tax will be levied. Recently, transportation costs have increased, so it seems difficult to stabilize the price of flour in the future. Mayor Wu immediately replied that the business tax was decided by the central government and could not be arbitrarily adjusted locally, but the municipal government would try to waive it.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Coal Industry Association said: To stabilize coal prices, it is necessary to open up sources. Currently, the city's bituminous coal is allocated by the Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan. The city's coal industry association only receives 5,000 tons per month, which is not enough for distribution. To suppress the black market, it is necessary to open up sources. The problem now is not that there is no coal, but that there are no ships. We hope that the government will allocate ships to load coal in Kailuan, Haifang, and other places. The Coal Industry Association has restricted the legal profits of its members to no more than 20%. A representative of the Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan said that fuel prices have soared recently, but bituminous coal prices have not risen. Bituminous coal is allocated by them and will maintain previous prices. In addition, the raw materials for coal briquettes have not risen, so the price of coal briquettes has not risen today. The total amount of coal allocated by the committee each month is 200,000 tons, and the amount of coal used by the city's public utilities, such as the power company, gas company, and water company, is 40,000 to 50,000 tons, which accounts for a quarter of the total. Moreover, coal from Hankou, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Qingdao, and other places must also be distributed by Shanghai, so the committee also feels that it is really difficult to make ends meet. The government has been trying its best to open up sources, and ships are regularly sent to various places to purchase.</p>
<p>Cloth Industry</p>
<p>The representative of the Cloth Industry Association stated that the two main reasons for the current increase in cloth prices are: (1) There is insufficient stock. Before the war, the city had 10 million bolts of cotton cloth in stock, which were later purchased by the Japanese. (2) The season is approaching autumn, and citizens need cloth urgently. People in the countryside are more stable in their lives, so they are buying cloth in groups. Recently, 600,000 bolts have been shipped to the Northeast. Production is insufficient, so the increase in cloth prices is passive. The association has repeatedly tried to stabilize prices. The representative of the Woolen Yarn Industry Association said that due to the impact of rumors, it has been rumored in the market recently that foreign exchange will be adjusted again, and the weather is getting colder, so citizens are buying enthusiastically, and there are few sources, so supply is less than demand, creating a situation of scarcity. After various trade associations complained about their plight,</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng began by saying: Mayor Wu has been most concerned about the prices in the city since taking office, but what is really closely related to citizens are daily necessities such as rice, oil, coal, cloth, and sugar. As long as the prices of these major items do not rise, there will be no serious impact on people's livelihood, so the mayor's stabilization of prices can be based on this principle. The mayor immediately expressed great agreement with Du's opinion and said that the municipal government and the responsible persons of various associations have regular contact, which can ensure that prices will not rise. However, the mayor believes that the cotton cloth industry, the coal industry, and the woolen yarn industry also have a direct impact on citizens, so it was decided that the Social Affairs Bureau and representatives of the relevant trade associations will organize a price review committee to ensure that various industries enter the right track and do not take any excessive actions, lest the authorities take action to ban them. Finally, Shi Zhidang, the representative of the Western Medicine Industry Association, reported on the current situation of the industry, and the meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Fourteen Groups Hold Garden Party and Reception to Entertain U.S. Military Dependents Today</p>

<p>Former Japan Beer Company; Kong Xiangxi Purchases</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The "Great Japan Beer Company," formerly established by the Japanese in Hongkou, was auctioned by the Enemy and Puppet Assets Processing Bureau to the "China-America Soda Company." However, because the land was owned by Kong Xiangxi, a dispute arose. The councillors raised questions in the council. The processing bureau only auctioned the factory's production equipment, not including the land. Kong did not want to rent the land to the China-America Soda Company, but wanted to buy the factory. The China-America authorities have agreed to transfer it. The price is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Director of Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan Talks About Levying Various Taxes; Increasing Entertainment Tax Is Inevitable; Municipal Construction Donation Will Be Postponed Until Next Month</p>
<p>Director of Finance Bureau, Gu Chunfan, told reporters yesterday: The entertainment tax rate will be increased to 50%. Once the official notice from the City Council arrives, it will be implemented. Although representatives of the entertainment industry came to the bureau to petition a few days ago, I told them that the increase in the tax rate was decided by the City Council. Only one person expressed opposition when this case was discussed at the meeting, and the rest of the councillors raised their hands in favor, so the increase in the tax rate is inevitable and cannot be changed by petitioning the bureau. When asked whether the entertainment tax on dramas would also be increased in the same way as other entertainment taxes, Gu said: The drama tax is currently 38%. The drama tax was not increased in the previous tax increase. If the official notice sent by the City Council to the bureau this time does not have clear provisions on the drama tax, the City Finance Bureau may not consider whether to increase the donation rate in the same way as cinemas. According to Gu's estimation, after the entertainment donation increases, the tax amount can be increased to 2.1 billion yuan per month. Mr. Wen said: The Finance Bureau originally set the amount for starting the levy of the banquet donation at 1,000 yuan, but now it is considering raising it to 2,000 yuan. Customer meals in hotels and restaurants that cost less than 2,000 yuan will not be levied. This new regulation will be implemented within a few days after being approved by the municipal meeting. Regarding the collection of municipal construction donations, the Finance Bureau has stipulated the calculation and collection methods for the donation tax. Within one or two days, a survey of the actual rent of each house will begin for all households in the city to determine the exact amount of house donation that the landlord should bear and pay. The Finance Bureau will collect it from the tenants together with the municipal construction donation, and then the tenants will deduct it from the rent.</p>
<p>Calculation Method of Municipal Construction Donation</p>
<p>In order to understand the collection and calculation method of the municipal construction donation, the reporter also visited He Jiayu, the section chief of the House Donation Section of the bureau. According to him, the rents of the houses in the city were estimated by the former Public Concession Bureau and the French Municipal Council in 1937. Now that prices have soared in the past nine years, the houses in the city are divided into three grades, and the total amount of the autumn house donation is increased by several times according to the 1937 rent value as follows: For Grade A houses, those with an estimated annual rent value of more than 1,800 yuan in 1937 will be calculated at 100 times the estimated rent. For Grade B houses, those with an estimated annual rent value of more than 1,000 yuan and less than 1,800 yuan in 1937 will be calculated at 75 times. For Grade C houses, those with an estimated annual rent of less than 1,000 yuan in 1937 will be calculated at 50 times. For example, for a house with a monthly rent of 25 yuan and an annual rent of 300 yuan before the war (Grade B), the amount of donations to be collected in the autumn will be 15,000 yuan (i.e., 300 multiplied by 50 times), but this is the total amount of the autumn house donation and municipal construction donation combined. Calculated separately, the house donation should be 20% of the actual rent collected, which should be borne by the landlord, and the rest is for municipal construction, which is borne by the tenant. For example, for the house with an annual rent of 300 yuan before the war, the actual rent is now 10,000 yuan per month. The landlord should pay 20% of the house donation each month (i.e., 2,000 yuan), and 6,000 yuan for the house donation per quarter. The autumn donation is 15,000 yuan. After deducting the house donation of 6,000 yuan, the remaining 9,000 yuan is the municipal construction donation borne by the tenant this quarter. From this, it can be seen that the amount of municipal construction donation is inversely proportional to the house donation. The higher the rent, the higher the house donation, and the less the municipal construction donation paid by the tenant.</p>
<p>Survey of Rent to Determine the Exact Amount</p>
<p>As for the total amount of the winter house donation and the municipal construction donation, it will be calculated by doubling the amount in autumn, but the house donation part is still 20% of the actual rent. The bureau will start surveying the actual rent paid by the residents of the city this week. The survey forms have been printed and must be filled out and mailed to the bureau by October 20 to determine the amount of house donation that the landlord should collect. If there are a large number of tenants living in one house, the form should be filled out by the second landlord who sublets the house and report the rent received by the main landlord. The third tenants do not need to fill it out. In the future, when the collection starts, the municipal construction donation and the house donation will be combined into one form, called the "Municipal Construction Donation and House Donation Payment Form." This donation tax will all be paid by the tenant first, and then deducted from the rent paid to the landlord. As for the start of the collection of the municipal construction donation, due to the time spent on investigation and preparation, and the valuation work of the houses in Nanshi Zhabei has not yet been completed, the start of the collection will be postponed until mid-November. It is estimated that the total revenue from the municipal construction donation in autumn and winter will be about 20 billion yuan.</p>

<p>A Rich Young Man Troubled by His Wife</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhuang Honggao, a Ningbo native, 48 years old, the owner of the Hengdeli Clock and Watch Shop and Daming Glasses Company on Nanjing Road, lives at 47 Futian Village, Beijing West Road. He has a concubine who lives at 53 Mingde Lane, Avenue Foch. Zhuang has a son named Zhiguo, who is young and dashing and often frequents singing and dancing halls. In February 1940, he officially married Liu (24 years old) at the Xindu Hotel and lived together in Room 35, Peien Apartments, 2 Rue Luber. Five years after the marriage, Liu had three daughters, the eldest named Biru, the second Bichan, and the youngest Biting. However, the relationship between the couple was cold. Years ago, Zhiguo met a dancer named Dong Ai'e (also known as Zheng Miaoyun) at the Metropole Dance Hall and rented a house at Dahua Apartments, Jing'an Temple Road. Liu found out about this and caught them in the act last December. She took Dong and her husband Zhiguo to the District Attorney's Office. In the end, because of the relationship between husband and wife, she did not want to pursue the matter excessively and only ordered Zhiguo to write a letter of repentance and sever all relations with Dong forever. The matter was then dropped. Unexpectedly, Zhiguo could not forget his old love and continued to be passionately in love with Dong. He went there again in July of this year, but the apartment had been leased by Dong to another dancer, Wang Juan, so he did not get the result. Recently, Liu began to find out where her husband and Dong were living together, which was also in Room 24 of Peien Apartments. She invited lawyer Chen Zhen to report to the Lujiiawan Police Station on the night before last. The police were dispatched to catch them in the act. Zhuang and Dong were in the same room and were arrested. After being taken to the police station, Liu insisted on sending them to the District Attorney's Office. Yesterday, they were sent to the District Attorney's Office. After an investigation, Zhiguo invited lawyer Song Yaogi to request bail. Prosecutor Ding then ordered Zhuang and Dong to each pay a bond of 10 million yuan and await summons.</p>

<p>Seagoing Vessels Ordered; Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Nanchang ship, which was carrying relief supplies to North China from Hong Kong, was delayed until today due to avoiding the wind. It is scheduled to sail north tomorrow. It will not load any more cargo or passengers in Shanghai.

It was learned yesterday that it would be delayed until the 11th of this month before it could arrive in port, and it is scheduled to return to Batavia on the 13th. The Norwegian ship Sumerverl, which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on Sunday of this week to return to the United States, could not depart on time due to insufficient unloading and a large amount of export cargo. It has now been changed to export on the 12th. The American firm Foremost Shipping Company has expanded its shipping business greatly since resuming operations after the victory. In addition to its own ships, it also acts as an agent for ships carrying relief supplies and coal, no less than one hundred ships. The original office space was insufficient, so it has moved to the fifth floor of the North China Daily News Building to work. The telephone has also increased by three lines (12992 to 4).</p>
<p>The Material Supply Bureau. Seven seagoing vessels purchased in Canada, Hai and Hai have been received by China Merchants. Haihang will also be received.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the Social Affairs Bureau's Ninth Section ended the shelters for the cold last spring, many refugees have lost relief. Autumn has now entered, and winter is approaching. The establishment of shelters for the cold this year should be actively prepared. It is heard that it has been decided to hold at least ten shelters for the cold this year, accommodating 5,000 people. However, due to the serious housing shortage in the city, it is not easy to find suitable places for a while. Personnel are currently being dispatched to contact them separately. It is expected that reception can begin in mid-next month.</p>

<p>U.S. Army Logistics Headquarters Abolished; Gillem Flies to Beiping Today to Succeed as U.S. Member of the Military Mediation Department; Holds Farewell Press Conference Yesterday</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Lieutenant General Gillem, Commander of the U.S. Army in China, will fly to Beiping today to succeed Robertson as the U.S. member of the Military Mediation Department. Yesterday afternoon at 4:15, he held a farewell press conference on the 11th floor of Hu Ma Apartment.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Gillem first described his experience in Shanghai. He then said that the U.S. Army in China will establish two institutions in China in the future, one is the Beiping Military Mediation Department Executive Group, and the other is the Nanjing U.S. Military Advisory Group in China. These two institutions are established independently, and all supplies are separate. However, important cases must still be approved by Marshal Marshall.</p>
<p>The biggest task of the U.S. Army Headquarters in China is to assist China in evacuating Japanese troops. A total of 2.2 million people have been evacuated, and there are still about 24,000 technical personnel, etc. It is expected that all of them will be repatriated before January next year. There are about 15,000 Japanese troops in North China. After the transportation work in Central China and South China is completed, they will continue to be repatriated, and the Northeast will also begin at the same time.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Logistics Headquarters in Shanghai will be abolished from today, but a small number of personnel under the direction of Colonel Kooney will remain here to continue to complete the search for missing U.S. airmen and transport U.S. military supplies. The U.S. military court's trial of Japanese war criminals is expected to be completed within two months. In addition, 27 German spies are being tried.</p>
<p>In addition to the U.S. Information Service, there is also a semi-official agency, the Foreign Surplus Property Clearance Committee, hosted by its representative in China, Mr. Hobbs. According to the Sino-U.S. agreement, the materials must be guarded by the U.S. military for 60 days before they are cleared.</p>
<p>Finally, some Soviet reporters asked Lieutenant General Gillem about the incident in which 20 U.S. soldiers beat two Russians last time. Lieutenant General Gillem said that the matter is being investigated closely by Mr. Davis, the U.S. Consul in Shanghai. He also said that when people of two different nationalities meet, misunderstandings often occur due to language barriers and different customs. However, the perpetrators, regardless of their nationality, should be punished.</p>
<p>Russian Confesses to the Crime of Killing His Wife</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The tenant, Russian Duminov, at 69 Zhao Zhujiao Road on the second floor, stabbed his wife, Inusova, to death with a butcher knife at about 10:00 AM on the 28th of last month. Afterwards, Du went to the Changshu Road Police Station to falsely report that his wife had been murdered in the kitchen of the pavilion. Director Zhao of the Zhao Branch sent Judicial Section Chief Wang Duanhong and Section Member Li Dacheng to investigate. It was believed that Du was a major suspect and was taken to the police station for temporary detention. Du was burly, wearing a U.S. military uniform, and had a small mustache. He had been a detective at the French police station for many years and was extremely cunning. He always denied killing his wife. In the detention center for a day and night, he had no grief. After Section Chief Wang interrogated him for two days and nights, he confessed everything and admitted to stabbing his wife to death. According to his confession, his wife was greedy for petty gains and often rented rooms to the U.S. Navy for secret meetings. He resented this and their relationship was not harmonious. At the time of the incident, his wife was holding a sharp knife to cut beef. She had swung the knife to kill Du, and Du seized the knife and killed her. Afterwards, in order to blame others, he deliberately messed up the clothes in the house to pretend to be robbed. After going out, he went to several friends' houses before going to the police station to make a false report in the afternoon. Du also added two points: (1) He met his friend Gao Wencao as soon as he went out, at 11:10, and Gao's statement of 10:15 was a mistake.</p>

<p>The Autumn Battlefield of the Tuo River and Si River</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Gucheng Dispatch, September 15th, Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Having concluded my journey along the Huai River, I rode swiftly between the Tuo and Si Rivers, paying homage to the current battlefield and spending this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>On Mid-Autumn Day, there was no moonlight before midnight, dark clouds covered the sky, and autumn rain drizzled. Local residents slaughtered pigs to犒勞 the troops amidst the ruins. Soldiers played the dongxiao, its sound mournful, causing those who missed home to weep.</p>
<p>A cool breeze arose from the horizon, military bugles wailed, the deer antlers formed a menacing array, the sound of hooves came and went like a sudden rain, rising and falling amidst desolate villages and wild trees. The barking of dogs was faintly heard, while the roar of car engines was like thunder. Looking from a high place, the earth was vast and indistinct, without a single spark of light, only the grass beside my feet whispered a sorrowful autumn song. This is the modern battlefield!</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Heartbreaks, a Song of Gaixia</p>
<p>Fifty li south of Lingbi County lies Haochengji, the ancient Gaixia. It was here that Han Xin defeated Xiang Yu. Surrounded by the songs of Chu on all sides, the hero wept. Yet, Xiang Yu did not fail as a hero, and Consort Yu's suicide by sword only amplified the sentiment of bravery through the ages. Along the Lingbi-Si County road lies the tomb of Consort Yu, a desolate mound overgrown with autumn grass, but there is no lack of those who come to mourn throughout history. Su Zhe, in his elegy for Consort Yu's tomb, wrote: "Bu rebelled, Zeng died, the state was already in ruins, Yu has exhausted himself from now until the end, enduring hardship alone with Consort Yu, who allowed the enemy from the west, Liu Bang, to come?" Showing a sense of indignation. But Su Dongpo was different, writing: "The beauty under the tent wipes away her tears, the brave warrior before the gate has an aura like clouds; not betraying the monarch's will in haste, only Consort Yu and Zheng Jun." Giving much praise. However, after Empress Lü Zhi of Han died, her tomb was desecrated by the Chimei, truly incomparable.</p>
<p>During his peak, Xiang Yu returned from Qi and defeated Liu Bang's 560,000 troops at Pengcheng, pursuing them to the banks of the Sui River, where the Han army was annihilated and the Sui River was blocked by corpses. During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Cao attacked Xuzhou and conquered Tao Qian, capturing Suqian and Sining. In Lingbi, he massacred tens of thousands of men and women, leaving no chickens or dogs, and the Si River ceased to flow. This event is recorded in the Later Han Dynasty History. Yet, it is not as well-known as the Three Massacres of Yangzhou. Is it because the Chinese people are accustomed to slaughtering each other? This is one of China's secrets.</p>
<p>Ancient battlefields, modern battlefields, everywhere with bullet holes and bloodstains, people killed filling the fields, reflecting on the past, ten thousand kinds of heartache! The people are constantly suffering from war, locusts, and floods. When the army passes through, they are forced to provide labor, carriages, and supplies, weary of coping. When the Communist army was here, they put forward the slogan "For the People," but in the end, everything was "For the Communist Army." Where the reporter passed, the National Army had only taken over from the Communist army for just over a month, and everywhere was desolate, with weeds growing wild, no roads in the wilderness, and no complete houses in the villages, with more uninhabited houses. All of this was not directly destroyed by the previous month's war, but rather was the legacy of the Communist army's presence. The people also lacked political trust in the Communist army, being led in meetings, struggles, and purges day and night, with no peace in their minds, no peace in their days, and no peace in their months. Even though the Communist Party's border region government, county magistrates, and other personnel were subjectively eager to approach the masses, the people could not bear the poverty and took to fleeing en masse.</p>
<p>When the reporter crossed the Tuo River eastward, he encountered a group of farmers returning to their hometown from Gucheng after fleeing for half a year. These dozen or so people were neither landlords nor small landowners, but rather hired laborers who were "so poor they had no land to stand on." When asked why they had fled, they replied: "Are we afraid of not having food? Every day there are meetings and struggles, and we are forced to become enemies with our bosses. Who can bear such hardship? Seeing that things were not right, we fled to Gucheng to set up stalls and do odd jobs to make a living." Their homes were dilapidated, the war was still raging, and they did not know when they would be able to find stability.</p>
<p>The Ruined City of Lingbi, Grass Over the Knees</p>
<p>West of Lingbi lies the Tuo River, where the National and Communist armies confronted each other across the river for twelve months. Guerrilla warfare and patrols were common in the area. However, the Tuo River remained in the hands of the National Army, surrounded by earthen walls with numerous gun holes. The houses were intact, the autumn willows leaned over the water, full of the charm unique to the northern countryside. Villagers carried pears, blocking the road to sell them, the same variety as the Dangshan pears, asking only a hundred yuan per jin.</p>
<p>The highway from Gucheng to Lingbi, 85 li long, was originally a gravel road. After ten years of disrepair, and with the recent frequent traffic of vehicles and horses, heavy rain would turn it into mud that submerged the ankles, completely blocking traffic. The local government then mobilized the people to repair it, but only to the extent of digging earth and filling in the gaps, which could not withstand the erosion of rainwater. In late summer and early autumn this year, frequent rainfall meant that repairs had to be done after every rain, causing the people great hardship.</p>
<p>Lingbi and Sixian counties had been occupied by the Japanese army for many years. After Japan surrendered, the government sent personnel to take over. The Communist army then attacked Lingbi after Sixian on August 20, claiming it was to accept the surrender, but in reality, the Japanese army had already concentrated in Bengbu, and the puppet army was ordered to garrison after surrendering, hence the fighting. In July of this year, the National Army successively captured Sixian and Lingbi. The Communist army, in conjunction with the Lingbi County Self-Defense Brigade, and the puppet army once counterattacked Sixian, resulting in fierce battles. The Communist army suffered as many as ten thousand casualties.</p>
<p>The National Army captured Lingbi and Sixian by following the Gucheng-Sixian highway that the reporter took, crossing the Tuo River on July 17 and advancing eastward. County Magistrate Tang Kenan, transferred from Qingyang, took office in Gucheng on the 16th and headed east the next day. Gradually making contact, on the 21st, they forced the Communist army to its final stronghold, Phoenix Mountain. On the 22nd, they attacked with heavy artillery at dawn, and the Communist army collapsed, thus capturing Lingbi. When the National Army entered the city, there were only fourteen civilians in the city, and grass grew knee-deep in many streets. The Communist army had originally planned to implement a scorched earth policy and destroy the entire city, but the National Army engineers worked for a week and dug out a large number of homemade landmines and giant wooden-handled stick grenades (also a type of landmine) in various places, which the Communist army had not had time to detonate due to their hasty retreat.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived in Lingbi, the National Army had advanced continuously and had already replaced the city defense commander seven times. The people gradually returned, but the five thousand people who had returned were only one-tenth of the pre-war population. Although order was stable, the Communist county government and commissioner were located fifty li away, so villagers coming to the city to trade could only do so outside the city.</p>
<p>The city walls of Lingbi were extremely strong, with stone foundations and crenellations, over three zhang high, relics of the Qing Dynasty. When the Communist army occupied Lingbi last year, they conscripted ten thousand people, who brought their own pots and pans and food, and spent fifteen days and nights destroying them. Now only a circle of earthen mounds remains, full of bricks and stones. Other temples and monasteries inside and outside the city were also demolished, including the Christian church, for reasons that are truly inexplicable. The remaining houses in Lingbi are mostly thatched huts with earthen steps, reminiscent of ancient times. It is said that Xu Shen, the author of Shuowen Jiezi in the Later Han Dynasty, once governed here. Entering this dilapidated ancient city, thinking of the great scholar of writing, I wonder if Xu Shen completed his great work here?</p>
<p>Listening to Folk Songs at the Foot of Phoenix Mountain</p>
<p>Phoenix Mountain is located five li northwest of the city, a high mound of slate, over thirty meters high, without trees, with bunkers on top, which the Communist army had guarded. The reporter climbed the mountain and saw only bullet holes everywhere. The bunkers were also destroyed by bombing at that time, but have now been repaired, and the surrounding area is surrounded by chevaux de frise, made from cut trees. From here, one can see Mount Mao Yi, forty li away, still within Lingbi County. The Communist commissioner and the county magistrates of Su, Wu, Tong, and Xiao counties are stationed in the northeast and northwest areas of the city, levying grain and expanding the army, planning for a comeback. Most of the young people in that area have fled to Lingbi County. Lingbi has suffered severe flooding, and the area forty li northwest of Phoenix Mountain has become an inland lake. Recently, the water level has receded slightly, and the ochre-colored land can be seen emerging from the water. The Communist army has apparently received orders not to withdraw from its original controlled area.</p>
<p>The gain or loss of Phoenix Mountain determines the gain or loss of Lingbi. From the top of the mountain, Lingbi can be seen like a map in the palm of one's hand. At that time, the artillery fire was fierce, and the residents at the foot of the mountain fled eastward. The Communist army had spread propaganda about how the National Army was killing, setting fire to, hoping to make the people follow them, but as soon as the Communist army retreated and the artillery fire stopped, the people returned to their homes one after another. The foot of Phoenix Mountain was originally fertile land, each mu yielding 300 jin of wheat and sorghum, but now weeds are rampant, and it has not been cultivated for a year.</p>
<p>There is a folk song in northern Anhui that says: "Hoping for the Central Government, waiting for the Central Government, the Central Government comes and sweeps everything away; rather have the Central Government sweep everything away, than have the Eighth Route Army call us 'Auntie'."</p>
<p>Meaning that when the National Army comes, there will inevitably be war. Once the war starts, the houses will be reduced to ruins and swept away, which is conceivable, but this can still hope for stability, avoiding the Communist army coming to the door and calling us "Auntie" (a polite term), causing trouble with struggles. This kind of sentiment is extremely painful. The Chinese people today seek stability but cannot obtain it! A woman from Xiaozhang Village explained the meaning of this folk song to the reporter and said, "Not to mention calling us 'Auntie', as soon as they come, they borrow whatever they want, they even kowtow to you, but later when the struggles start, they want your head at every turn. It's really scary!</p>
<p>Xiaozhang Village is located at the foot of the mountain. A dozen pomegranate trees in front of the village were cut down by the National Army to be used as chevaux de frise for auxiliary fortifications, which the villagers all regretted. A weaving worker surnamed Wang, from Yanzhou, Shandong, came to Xiaozhang Village at the age of nineteen and is now forty-nine years old, but still speaks pure Yanzhou dialect. He said to the reporter: "I don't have any fields or land. When the devils came, I stopped working and loafed around, picking grass and helping people with odd jobs. That's how I barely managed to feed myself. When the Eighth Route Army came, they made it impossible to say anything, always having meetings for no reason. How can we farmers have the time for that? Inciting you to fight this person or that person, even something as small as an egg has to be fought over for half a day. For example, they ask me if someone has borrowed something from me. I think and think, and remember that this person borrowed an egg from me a long time ago. Then that's terrible, they want me to fight him. They even control what we eat and wear. You can't wear or eat anything good, they won't let you have any peace. But the Eighth Route Army, they eat well and grow fat, and no one says anything about that."</p>

<p>Key to Solving the Land Problem in Northern Jiangsu in the Future, A Sunday Forum Article by Wang Suzhen</p>
<p>In the August 11th edition of the Shen Bao Sunday Forum, I read Mr. Ge Kexin's "The Northern Jiangsu Land Problem Urgently Awaiting Resolution." I feel this is a crucial issue in dealing with the rural areas of Northern Jiangsu, worthy of attention and discussion.</p>
<p>From the Northern Jiangsu refugees demanding to return to their hometowns to negotiations for the CCP to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu, from the New Fourth Army's hasty implementation of "Land Reform" in Northern Jiangsu to Secretary Marshall's statement that it was the most difficult problem to solve! The CCP's refusal to relinquish local political power indicates that the Northern Jiangsu problem is extremely serious. It also makes us think of the crux of the Northern Jiangsu problem – the land problem.</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, and Northern Jiangsu specifically reflects the conditions of China's rural areas. All economic life depends on agricultural products. Naturally, the land problem, which affects the lives of farmers, is the main problem "urgently awaiting resolution" in this area.</p>
<p>After Madam Sun Yat-sen raised the idea of the "Kuomintang must implement its historical task—land reform" in her "Opinions on the Current Situation," apologists for the CCP even said that Northern Jiangsu had already implemented "land reform," farmers had already obtained land, and propagandized how the livelihood of the people in Northern Jiangsu had been improved and how close the relationship was between the people of Northern Jiangsu and the local "democratic government." They told wildly exaggerated stories that sounded very plausible!</p>
<p>In reality, the CCP's "land reform" in Northern Jiangsu was a serious mistake in both theory and style, and suffered an undeniable failure.</p>
<p>Because Ge Guang-sheng "could not deeply penetrate the CCP-controlled areas and thus could not learn the details" regarding the "land reform" of "land distribution based on population ratios," the author, being from Northern Jiangsu, "penetrated" into the "areas once controlled by the CCP" as the military situation in Northern Jiangsu shifted, and only then learned the truth about the local "land distribution." The details are described below:</p>
<p>When the "New Fourth Army Government" announced the so-called "Improve People's Livelihood Land Reform Plan," it dispatched "work teams" to the countryside at any time, convened all militia cadres, elected "Emancipated People's Representatives," and then convened a village meeting to bring the landlords of this village to account for old debts. The accounting method was very peculiar! In addition to tenants reversing rent and hired workers reversing wages, a beggar who begged in front of the landlord's door and had his begging bowl broken by a member of the landlord's family, a tenant farmer who supplied three fried eggs when the landlord went to the countryside, and the landlord's dog who fought with other dogs and trampled a seedling in someone else's field… The so-called "wanting to condemn someone, there's always an excuse." Under these messy "accusation hats," all the landlord's fields and properties, according to the compound interest method, were not enough to pay back even if they were all handed over. The "Emancipated People's Representative" then told him (the landlord) to first take out the field deed to offset these "debts" above. If the landlord protested or defended himself, or said that the old deed was lost, he was immediately considered a "stubborn element" or a "sabotage element" and forced to kneel on the roof and "look toward the old Central Government." If they could not be forced to come out after half a day, then all kinds of "democratic" tortures were used until the landlord could not bear the pain and handed over the field deed, or admitted that all his property was handed over, and he was "willing" to beg for a living to end it. As for the landlords' fields and lands that had fled elsewhere, the "democratic government" determined the "crime" to be confiscated, or the landlord's fields were adjacent to the landlord and sold on their behalf. Landlords' fields were calculated, and then the "work team" convened a large meeting of the "masses" in the village, explaining that everyone had settled old debts, and the poor had been liberated. But this was a "victory of the people," and everyone had to "fairly distribute the fruits of victory." The beggar who had broken a begging bowl and was compensated with dozens of acres of land had to take out his "property" and distribute it to everyone; as a result, land was distributed on average according to the land area and population density of each village. In the so-called "first district," each person at most received two and a half acres of land, and at least one acre and seven or eight tenths of an acre of land. After the field boundaries were measured, the person distributing the land designated the grain that the person who received the land had to hand over. Tenants who had cultivated dozens of acres of land had to give up the grain in the fields they had worked so hard to cultivate to others to harvest. These tenants not only did not receive the "fruits of victory," but some of them suffered losses that exceeded the amount of rent they had paid to the landlord. As for the impact of land distribution on independent farmers, middle peasants, and rich peasants, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>In theory, the CCP once solemnly swore to abandon "land revolution" and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People. Mao Zedong also sang the praises of "New Democracy," implementing rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and increasing wages. In Mr. Huang Yanpei's book "Return from Yan'an," it was said that Mao Zedong also discovered that the old Party jargon and foreign jargon were not correct, and that farmers did not necessarily need land, as long as they had land to cultivate. Farmers sometimes need to borrow money for economic turnover, so there are still landlords in Yan'an. Yan'an advocates rent reduction and interest rate reduction, but guarantees rent and interest payment. Whether the situation in Yan'an is like this, the author does not know. However, the CCP in Northern Jiangsu has now overturned all the promises and declarations of Yan'an, causing people to doubt the "words" and "deeds" of the Communist Party. At the same time, in the implementation of policies, the CCP has received a high tide of dissatisfaction from the entire Northern Jiangsu farmers.</p>
<p>Some writers who live in foreign houses in Shanghai and specialize in creating revolutionary theories may ask: Isn't it much better for farmers to get land than not to get land? After this improvement, farmers should be ecstatic. How can there be any dissatisfaction?</p>
<p>This is because those writers do not experience the actual situation and only know how to be arbitrary, and they are suffering from the same disease as the CCP's resolute "doing." May I ask: (1) Can farmers who receive one acre and seven or eight tenths of an acre of land per person already have enough food and clothing? (2) Has land been evenly distributed when one village receives one acre and seven or eight tenths of an acre of land per person, and another village receives two and a half acres of land per person? (3) The so-called realization of "tillers have their land," we will not take care of the landlords who do not farm for the time being, but those self-cultivators, middle peasants, and rich peasants all farm, their lives were originally well-off, but now their lives are insufficient. Will they be satisfied with a kind of "improvement" that has been wantonly imposed on them?</p>
<p>Or someone will say: In the past, when the land was not distributed, everyone could still get by. Now that all the landlords' land has been distributed, everyone can't get by, and their lives are insufficient. Why is that? If we count the current population and land area of Northern Jiangsu and conduct an in-depth investigation of the rural economic situation, we will know that although Northern Jiangsu is still a rural village with an agricultural economy, due to the rapid increase in the farmer population, it can no longer rely entirely on agricultural products, but needs industry, commerce, and transportation to develop outwards.</p>
<p>To give a few examples: In a certain village that the author visited, a certain household did not cultivate much land, and there were several young men in the family. This family only left two men to cultivate the land at home, and the rest went to the town and to distant places to work in industry and commerce, working as helpers. A certain household did not cultivate enough land for the whole family to eat. This family sailed to various places to do business, pulled rickshaws in Shanghai, and worked as short-term laborers in Jiangnan to make up for the annual food shortage. There are many other complex situations, but in short, it is not entirely reliant on "self-cultivation" to solve life, but a widespread situation.</p>
<p>So, let's study the CCP's "land distribution" situation. According to the population of each village, how much land will be given to you to cultivate. As for the result of "distribution according to the population of each village," no matter how many people you have, whether there is enough land or not, it will be "evenly distributed" to you, that's it. There is a tenant farmer with six people in his household, including his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. His family cultivated sixty acres of land. According to the payment of rent, fertilizer, and seeds in previous years, they could net seventy or eighty dan of grain every year, enough for the family to live comfortably. After this year's "land distribution," he only got ten acres of land and zero, and after paying the public grain, it is estimated that he would only get more than twenty dan of grain. His life suddenly "deteriorated." In addition to this year's wheat harvest, he exchanged more fertilizer and seeds, and cultivated fifty more acres of land for those who distributed land to him for nothing. The so-called "democratic government" that takes care of the working class has given the farmers a heavy blow, and the response it has received from the broad masses of people is an expression of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Although the "democratic government" of the "New Fourth Army" has forced "doing" in such an undemocratic way, have we not heard that in the villages of Gaoyou, Qutang, Haian, Rugao, and other places, the torches of rebellion are continuing to burn? Are not these flames of liberation being fueled by "democratic good governance"?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of style, all "settling accounts" and "reversing rent" have simply become rogue methods of extortion, completely disregarding propriety, justice, integrity, shame, morality, and law. The government does not guide the people to abide by the "law," but guides the people to make "trouble." May I ask what country in the world has a social organization that only needs trouble and does not need governance? This point, I am afraid that the CCP, in its ten thousand times of cover-up of Northern Jiangsu, also has to admit that "some cadres have made mistakes in their style"! However, these "mistakes" have already been made in the "starting point of the upper leadership." Just imagine, without the same open "guidance" from above, which Chinese would invent from nothing that someone had eaten three of his eggs in the past, and now he had to settle back dozens of acres of land?</p>
<p>No matter what the historical lessons are, this time the CCP's "land distribution" measures in Northern Jiangsu have suffered an undeniable failure! The CCP's failed experiment in Northern Jiangsu is also a lesson for "the Kuomintang must carry out its historical task—land reform."</p>
<p>We should know that the Communist Party's "reform" is because it has not seen the crux of the problem; what we urgently need to study now is where its crux lies. From the CCP's failure, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Farmers' expectations are not so much in the distribution of land as in the distribution of enough grain to live on.</p>
<p>(2) Farmers' demands are not in how fair the distribution of land is, but in finding ways to increase grain harvests so that everyone's lives are not short of.</p>
<p>(3) Farmers need to do their best and take what they need, but they are unwilling to have their hopes of free upward development restricted by others.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, we should pay attention to: How to improve the tenancy system in Northern Jiangsu? How should the land law restricting land concentration be implemented? How should agricultural technology to improve farms and increase production be actively promoted?</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the tenancy system. In China, whether in Northern Jiangsu or other rural areas, there have always been many unreasonable situations. Now the government is implementing a 25% rent reduction, which will naturally reduce the burden on tenants a lot. We hope that governments at all levels in all places can implement this earnestly and quickly. At the same time, local governments should strictly prohibit various systems of exploitation and oppression by landlords, such as "fixed rent" (paying rent to the landlord regardless of whether the year is good or bad) and "advance rent" (paying the rent in advance, regardless of whether there is a harvest or not).</p>
<p>Regarding restricting land concentration, I very much agree with Mr. Ge's proposal to "levy land rent income tax on excess land at a progressive rate… For excessive amounts, the government will issue land bonds and selectively buy a part." Excessive land concentration increases the negative forces of landlords' exploitation and oppression. At the same time, landlords "wear taxes and eat rent," indulging in leisure and reducing the forces of social progress. May I ask, how many landlords in Northern Jiangsu with three or four hundred mu to thousands of mu of land, in addition to calculating rent every year, have promoted the improvement of farms or abandoned land to invest in factory industries to benefit their hometowns and build their motherland? Therefore, I think that only if the government uses the above two methods to oppress the landlords, so that they reduce their interest in land and pay attention to investing in industry and commerce. In this way, land will not be concentrated in the hands of landlords for a long time, and the goal of "tillers have their land" will be achieved.</p>
<p>As for improving agriculture, it is even more urgent. Sun Yat-sen once said: "China does not have big capitalists, only big poor and small poor. China's problem lies in ignorance, poverty, and weakness." Yes, the "poor" and backward situation of rural areas like Northern Jiangsu is because it still uses the old-fashioned "ignorant" method of cultivation. Therefore, on that vast fertile field, it has several million dan less harvest than others every year, and it cannot resist the invasion of natural and man-made disasters. Like the coastal areas of Xinghua, there is only one rice harvest every year. If the water conservancy can be adjusted well in the future, can't it increase a season of wheat harvest and get several million dan more grain?</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu has now changed with the military situation. The land problem that was "disrupted" by the Communist army in the past now urgently needs the government to find ways to "improve," and the methods of improvement need to be dealt with carefully.</p>
<p>The war-torn areas within the occupied areas are full of devastation, with thousands of troubles. They cannot be compared to the "taking over" of enemy property in the recovered areas. The Communist Party's "land reform" has already "lost the hearts of the people" in Northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the government should intensify "collecting the hearts of the people" in its future handling of rural areas in Northern Jiangsu. How to collect the hearts of the people? The author believes that at least the following points should be achieved:</p>
<p>(1) Refer to the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in Various Provinces" promulgated in the past to properly resolve all land problems.</p>
<p>(2) Adjust the relationship between owners and tenants so that disputes between owners and tenants can be resolved fairly.</p>
<p>(3) Relieve poor farmers and improve their lives so that they directly feel that the Communist Party's propaganda is a deception.</p>
<p>(4) Strictly prohibit the "Returning Home Corps" from reversing the account or using pressure, and all individual disputes will be resolved by the township office (or a rural committee will be established, composed of the government, owners, tenants, and impartial gentry), or lawsuits will be filed in court, and all will be handled in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(5) Strictly prevent troublemakers from lurking, agitating, and disrupting order.</p>
<p>(6) For wasteland and public land, detailed verification and handling should be carried out. For land with owners, verify and return it. For land without owners, it cannot be allowed to be neglected and abandoned.</p>
<p>(7) Improve agricultural technology, relieve famine, increase production, and actively develop Northern Jiangsu by taking advantage of the current opportunity.</p>
<p>(8) Strengthen the self-defense forces of farmers and strictly prevent bandits from disturbing rural areas.</p>
<p>(9) Build highways and sanitary facilities, guide normal activities, and promote rural civilization</p>
<p>(10) Popularize literacy education, promote agricultural education, transform farmers' thinking, and all county and district offices should understand rural areas and pay attention to rural problems.</p>
<p>The above is only based on what the author has seen and cannot be considered complete. However, the author believes that dealing with the rural areas of Northern Jiangsu after the transformation is complicated and seemingly difficult, but following the rules and regulations is not too difficult. Because landlords in rural Northern Jiangsu have been constantly devastated and ravaged by the enemy puppet and Communist armies for many years, their land and economic concepts should also show their enlightenment, and the general poor people, after realizing that they have been deceived by the Communist Party, should also change their ways, cooperate with owners and tenants, and work hard to produce, and jointly help promote the Three Principles of the People's revolutionary cause. Prolonged chaos will inevitably lead to governance. This may not be the blessing of Northern Jiangsu and the country. However, district and township staff should also fully demonstrate their integrity and responsibility and devote themselves to regaining the hearts of the people.

<p>Women and Family</p>
<p>Where Are Women Going?</p>
<p>Wen</p>
<p>Are women ultimately to return to the kitchen or to step into society? This remains the focal point of disputes over women's issues today, and can even be said to be the key to why women's issues are issues at all. Here, the author excerpts the opinions of world figures on this issue,勉强 as an answer.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt: It depends on the circumstances. No generalizations can be made, nor can any fixed path be followed.</p>
<p>H.G. Wells: Women were originally happy to be protected by men. Modern social conditions have changed the relationship between husband and wife, so there is no set way for the relationship between husband and wife.</p>
<p>: It's all about money.</p>
<p>: Excessive freedom for women is dangerous. A happy marriage is an economic and social association, and it must be integrated as a whole.</p>
<p>: Men are always happy for women to rely on them—the problem depends entirely on the degree of understanding between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Paul Geraldy: Women who are economically self-sufficient are even more lovable.</p>
<p>Violette Horeau: A good mother should work outside. Women become new women in order to be good mothers. You can have a renewed interest in children's education, better communication, and a deeper understanding between parents and children.</p>
<p>Childhood Experiences</p>
<p>Tai</p>
<p>(1) Theft</p>
<p>When I was eight years old, one day I was playing under the window when Mrs. Bai said some secret things to my mother, which I heard. After Mrs. Bai left, my mother knew that I had heard their conversation and said to me, "If Mrs. Bai forgot to take her handbag today, would we hand her handbag over to someone else?"</p>
<p>"Of course not," I replied.</p>
<p>Mother continued, "Today, Mrs. Bai left something more important than her diary. She left a conversation that could make many people unhappy. Although she forgot to take these conversations, they still belong to her, so we can't hand these conversations over to anyone else, do you understand?"</p>
<p>I understood. From then on, I knew that any secret that someone asked me to keep or a secret that a friend unintentionally leaked in words was his thing, and I could not give these things to another person. Now friends like to come to my house, because they can all speak freely, and even children will not reveal their secrets. That little credit should be given to my mother.</p>
<p>(2) The Price of Pride</p>
<p>When I was nine and my sister was seven, we both received the highest grades awards at school. So we thought our family was an excellent family, and we bragged about our intelligence to our classmates. When my father heard it, he called us over.</p>
<p>Father blew up a light balloon as big as a human head and said to us solemnly, the balloon's name is Aima, and she is a very smart person. Father then told the story of Aima's life. Every time he talked about Aima's success, he would blow the balloon a little bigger. The story became longer and longer, and Aima was blown bigger and bigger. Later, we were so scared that we avoided it from a distance. When Aima swelled to the point of bursting, Father's story suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>"Now you don't dare to get close to Aima anymore, right?" Father asked us, "Aima is so proud and has such a big head. When you brag about yourselves to your classmates, the classmates feel about you the same way you feel about Aima. You are so proud that no one dares to get close to you.</p>
<p>From then on, every time we did something worthy of pride, we would think of Aima's big head, and our conceited thoughts would disappear immediately.</p>
<p>(3) A Fair Method</p>
<p>Every time my brother and I came back from school, we always felt hungry. One day, when we came back from school, we asked our mother for something to eat. My mother put a cake in front of us, with a small knife next to it, and said to us; "Whoever of you two separates the cake first, the other one has the right to choose first."</p>
<p>My brother was very quick. He grabbed the knife and wanted to cut the cake into two different sizes. Suddenly, he stopped and looked at his mother and then at me, and then cut the cake into two equal sizes. He let me take it first, and then he took the remaining one.</p>
<p>From then on, whenever we had to divide things to eat—cakes, bread, butter—we would divide them into two equal pieces, and we learned to always respect the rights of others.</p>
<p>When Your Child Falls in Love</p>
<p>Feng</p>
<p>When you find that your adult or adult children seem a little absent-minded, moody, and particularly concerned about dressing up lately, you may suspect that he (she) is falling in love. Then, dear parents, don't panic, and don't ignore it. This is the time to take on your greatest and most sacred responsibility!</p>
<p>Many parents like to treat their children, who are burning with intense love in their hearts, with intimidation, questioning, and even scolding. The result may be failure. Because love is not an ordinary piece of clothing, its mystery, sweetness, and charm cannot be relieved by a few words from parents. On the contrary, if a young person in love does not receive correct instructions, teachings, and love, unexpected dangers and tragic endings may occur. We should admit that love is not an immoral or abnormal act, especially for young people, it is a natural desire and impulse.</p>
<p>First of all, you should show your children that you quite agree with or admire his (her) proper friendships or love, because a person's ability to act and social skills are mostly developed in friendship. At the same time, you can suggest to him (her) to often invite friends to chat and gather, and should have a calm and detailed observation of the other party's personality, habits, and temperaments, and must not fall blindly in love because of a momentary impulse. Perhaps he (she) in love needs to go out to play and walk from time to time, you'd better not stop him. It is futile to prohibit it even in the beginning of love or when it is at its peak, and it will damage his (her) self-esteem and cause aversion. When he</p>
<h3>Fertile Land Turns into a Vast Expanse of Water: Frequent Hot Weather and Rain Result in Disaster</h3>
<p>Over 20,000 Acres of Sand Fields in Shatin Submerged</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changsha] The strong winds and heavy rain here cleared up at 3 PM on the 27th, returning to normal. The district offices are investigating the extent of the damage. Part of the County Agricultural Extension Office's buildings was also blown down by the strong winds. All the rice paddies are several feet deep in water, and the rice ears are almost completely submerged. The experimental planting area for American vegetable seeds has become a waterlogged area. An urgent telegram was sent to the county government requesting them to send personnel to inspect and make repairs.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The recent heavy rainstorms in this area caused water levels to rise sharply, turning low-lying areas into waterlogged lands. The sand fields in the Fourth and Seventh districts of Binjiang were formed by years of accumulated silt. After this impact, the new dikes built this year, with their unconsolidated soil, were the first to be breached and collapsed. The surging floodwaters became even more rampant, like a strong wind sweeping away fallen leaves, making rescue impossible. Up to seven sections of the embankment were destroyed. The formerly fertile land has now become a vast expanse of water, with over 20,000 acres of fields submerged. Of these fields, 90% were planted with soybeans, which were just about to mature and could have been harvested entirely. Now, they have suddenly encountered a major disaster, causing significant losses and raising concerns about people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>A Scoundrel in Southern Pudong Arrested for Being a Spy for the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Songjiang] Li Dwarf, a notorious scoundrel who roamed the Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian, and Southern Pudong areas, served as a secret agent for the traitor Xu of the puppet security team during the occupied period. Relying on his power, he extorted money. The people of Southern Pudong dared to be angry but dared not speak out. During the eight years of suffering, they all wanted to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. On the 18th of this month, Li was arrested after returning from drinking in Hujiaqiao, Fengxian. The news spread like wildfire, and people in Jinshanwei, Zhangyan, and Xinbang all applauded and cheered. Some even wrote down the scoundrel's crimes and posted them on the streets for people to see. It has been learned that Hujiaqiao has sent people to transfer him to the Fengxian County Government in Nanqiao for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Communist Spy Hiding in Suzhou Arrested and Admits to Mission</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] The shade outside the entrance of Wen Fengrun Sauce Shop outside the Lou Gate in this city is a gathering place for vagrants. Recently, a Communist spy, Wang Fagen, suddenly mixed in with them, offering small favors and using them to gather military intelligence. A few days ago, Wang Fagen instigated Wang Ziqing and Wu Linsheng to go to Wuxi to gather military intelligence. However, upon getting off the train, they were spotted by military police stationed in Wuxi and were apprehended. After questioning Wang Ziqing, he confirmed that he had been instigated by Wang Fagen to go to Wuxi to gather military intelligence. Wu Linsheng denied it vehemently. The military police stationed in Wuxi reported the information to the Second Battalion of Military Police stationed in Suzhou, which sent personnel in disguise to investigate the address. After confirming the person's presence, Wang Fagen was arrested on the morning of the 29th. After repeated interrogation, he admitted to having a Communist mission, but he was not directly involved and had a mastermind above him. The Military Police Battalion stationed in Suzhou is currently conducting a secret investigation.</p>
<h3>Yang Yanbin Bedridden in Mudu</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Wuxi] The bandits of Bada in Pingtai Mountain, originally scheduled to be concentrated in Xukou for reorganization on the 23rd, have been postponed to the end of the month due to continuous rain and inconvenient boat travel on Taihu Lake.

<h3>Street Peddlers Suffer Losses: Robbed on Top of Train</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou] When the 54th Shanghai-Nanjing fourth-class passenger train departed from Shanghai North Station at 1:20 AM on the 28th, due to the crowding of passengers, some street peddlers climbed onto the roof of the train with their goods. There were about seven or eight peddlers between Shanghai and Wuxi, each carrying bolts of cloth. At 4:50 AM, while it was still dark, the train stopped at Hushu Pass Station. Unexpectedly, twelve strong men, dressed in military uniforms but without unit insignia or collar badges, were lying in wait on the roof of the train. When the train was about to move, they pulled out their bayonets from their waists, cut the ropes securing the cloth, and forcibly snatched the cloth, throwing it onto the north-side platform. Seven or eight bandits quickly jumped down, each carrying bolts of cloth under their arms, and fled. Station police officers discovered this and gave chase, but the bandits escaped across the river. The peddlers suffered extremely heavy losses.</p>

<h3>Bandit Gangs in the Border Areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan Provinces Completely Disintegrated; Bandit Leaders Zhang Lao Si and Zeng Ying Executed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanchang on the 29th] Public security in Jiangxi Province is gradually becoming more stable. Previously, during the lean season, bandit activities were frequently reported. Recently, after joint suppression by the provincial government and neighboring provinces, the banditry has subsided somewhat. The bandit gangs in southern Jiangxi and the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan have been completely disintegrated. Bandit leaders Zhang Lao Si and Zeng Ying have both been executed. The bandit gangs in eastern Jiangxi were led by Zhang and Zeng. With the elimination of Zhang's gang, Zeng's gang still has remnants, and they are currently being encircled and suppressed. The bandit gangs in northern Jiangxi previously had senior central government officials stationed in Guling. The provincial government deployed stronger forces to station around the outer perimeter of Mount Lu and Nanxunqian, and the bandits' power was suppressed. They then fragmented into smaller groups, appearing from time to time to loot soldiers and rob goods. The Jiangxi and Hubei authorities are planning a joint suppression. The bandits in western Jiangxi have fled into Hunan Province. If the Jiangxi forces are slightly weaker, they may return to Jiangxi to cause trouble.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Appropriation of Temples</h3>
<p>According to the "Provisional Constitution" and the "Draft Constitution," monks are also citizens of the Republic of China, and they enjoy the same rights and obligations as other citizens. We should not view monks with traditional mindsets. Citizens whose rights are violated can petition the government, and monks are no exception. Why should we be surprised? Regarding the appropriation of temples, we cannot blame the monks for misunderstanding. Their rights have been violated, so it's no wonder they are angry. We need to investigate the cause of the Municipal Assembly's proposal to appropriate temples, which is for the Jade Buddha Temple. According to the monks of the Jade Buddha Temple, the District Office of the Thirteenth District is occupying the Buddhist Academy. Initially, it was borrowed for 20 days, then extended for two months, and finally became an indefinite loan. Furthermore, the District Chief's residence is also located inside the temple. The Municipal Assembly is a legislative body, and its target is the people. Honorable councilors, please think again. – (Sun Dayun)</p>
<h3>The Wishes of a School-Dropping Apprentice</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I was a student at Beihang Street Elementary School in Tongxiang County. I had to drop out of school after the enemy invaded. With the high cost of living, my father could not afford to send me to school. After a year, I was sent to work in society. I encountered a despotic shop owner who didn't even allow me to read Shen Bao or write letters home during my free time. So, after five years, my knowledge is still as poor as when I first dropped out of school. Now that I am of age, my future is bleak. Seeing the large number of school dropouts in society, I suggest that kind gentlemen in society establish a night school self-study course or reading room for school-dropping apprentices so that young workers can receive some intellectual enlightenment in their spare time!

<p>Reply to Mr. Ge Zhongyun: Regarding your father's fingernail being removed at the Nanyang Hospital, the hospital's reply to us is as follows: "Mr. Ge Liangxiong, 41 years old, came to the outpatient clinic on the 13th and was diagnosed with a paronychia of the fourth finger of his left hand. It was explained to him that he needed to go to the minor surgery room to have the nail removed to drain the pus. After the explanation, the surgery was performed. As the original letter stated, 'he was given an anesthetic and went home in good condition.' It is expected that there may be some pain after the anesthesia wears off. If it is said that no explanation was given before the surgery, firstly, an explanation was clearly given beforehand; secondly, how could the pus be drained without removing the nail; and thirdly, he agreed and went to the operating room. If it is said that he felt pain after returning home and went to the hospital to ask for medicine, then our hospital has nine attending physicians in the internal medicine department, and they would not ignore this matter. However, if the statement is unclear, the original treating physician would not dare to prescribe medicine without understanding the condition." Special Reply.</p>

<h3>Nuremberg Tribunal to Announce Verdict: Nazi War Criminals to be Sentenced Today; At Least Thirteen to be Sentenced to Death; Four Out of Seven Organizations Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): The severity of the crimes committed by the 21 major Nazi war criminals varies, and the sentences they deserve will be announced together tomorrow. At that time, the President of the International Military Tribunal, Lord Lawrence of Britain, will announce them alone. Each defendant will enter the courtroom individually to hear the verdict.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 30th] The 21 German war criminals will be sentenced today. Nuremberg is under tight security, as if facing a major enemy. Armored vehicles and light tanks pass through the medieval streets, the rumbling of wheels breaking the silence of the ancient world, filling the air with tension. The Nazi Party movement originated here, and the fate of the Nazi leaders will also be buried here forever. The Germans are saddened by this sight. The International Tribunal will hold its final session today. Security is even tighter, with military police everywhere. Police are searching pedestrians and vehicles on the streets. Outsiders will not be allowed to enter the courtroom to listen to the verdict unless they have a special admission pass. They can only listen to the reading of the verdict from loudspeakers. Each criminal will be sentenced separately and will be allowed to request clemency from the Four-Power Control Council for Germany in Berlin.</p>
<p>[News Agency Report] London, 30th (Broadcast): The International Military Tribunal, which is trying the Nazi war criminals, began today to read the tens of thousands of words of the judgment through its President, Sir Lawrence of Britain. The judgment found the Nazi regime guilty and pointed out that the war crimes committed by the regime were unprecedented in history. The crimes committed by the war criminals were the systematic implementation of violence and terror against the invaded people of Europe. However, the court ruled that the German High Command, the General Staff, the German Cabinet, and the Sturmabteilung were not criminal organizations. The Schutzstaffel, the Sicherheitsdienst, and the Secret Police were found to be criminal organizations. The court stated that after the purge movement in 1934, the Sturmabteilung became "relatively unimportant." Although some members of the Sturmabteilung participated in war crimes and inhumane acts, it should not be immediately assumed that all its members participated in or were aware of criminal acts. According to the most experienced observers, at least thirteen of the 21 major Nazi war criminals will be sentenced to death. It is believed that Schacht, Dönitz, and others may be spared the death penalty, while Hess may receive special treatment.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Contents of the Judgment</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 30th] The International War Crimes Tribunal convened this morning at 10:00 AM (5:04 PM Shanghai time), and President Judge Lawrence read the judgment. The first defendant to enter the courtroom was Schirach, followed by Ley, Nazi Youth Movement leader Schirach, Jewish executioner Streicher, financial leader Funk, and Schacht, followed by Rosenberg, Frick, Neurath, Frick, Göring, Hess, and Ribbentrop. President Lawrence first briefly described the agreement and regulations made by the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, on August 6, 1943, and explained the composition, jurisdiction, and tasks of the court. He then discussed the process of the trial, such as the date and circumstances of the 403 hearings that had been held. He then discussed the issue of aggressive war and the laws related to the issue, pointing out that the court was bound by the four-country agreement. The regulation was the result of the legal exercise of sovereign legislative powers by the countries accepting Germany's surrender. After studying the Nazi Party's plan, the court found that the German people's desire for unification within the German borders was largely related to the actions that caused the invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia. The abolition of the Treaty of Versailles was an important motive for attempting to prove that the German government's policies were reasonable. The demand for land was an excuse to acquire living space at the expense of other countries. The expulsion of Jews from outside the German race was a direct cause of the persecution of the Jewish people. The demand for the establishment of national armed forces resulted in the largest scale of rearmament.</p>
<p>President Lawrence continued, "What the defendants are entitled to is a fair trial based on legal principles and facts." The main reasons for the defendants' pleas were: "At the time of the so-called criminal acts, no country had launched an aggressive war, and there was no legal definition of aggressive war, no explicit provision for punishment, and no special court had been established before to try and punish such criminals. Therefore, punishing the criminals of aggressive war is a post-facto law, which is contrary to the legal principles of civilized countries." President Lawrence said that the arson of the German Reichstag was an excuse used by Hitler and his cabinet to suspend the provisions of the constitution that guaranteed freedom. Actions such as destroying other political parties, using concentration camps, establishing secret police and the Sicherheitsdienst to eliminate political enemies, and reducing the powers of local governments were all aimed at enabling the German government to monopolize political power.</p>
<p>[News Agency Report] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Soviet Chief Judge Nikitchenko continued to announce the part related to the massacre of Jews, saying that most of the 90,000 people killed by the Nazis in one year were Jews. Based on the Nazi doctrine that no Jew should be of German blood, the Jews suffered this tragic fate. From 1938, almost all Jews were expelled from German society. The court then began to announce the part about the crimes of the seven important Nazi organizations: (1) the Nazi Party leadership, (2) the Gestapo, (3) the Sicherheitsdienst, (4) the Sturmabteilung, (5) the Schutzstaffel, (6) the Cabinet, and (7) the High Command and the Supreme Headquarters. All four occupation zones are treating them fairly in accordance with the anti-Nazi legal concepts.</p>
<p>[Taibao News] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): The Nuremberg Tribunal convened this afternoon to announce the verdict. Judge Dieter announced the part about the evidence, saying that there was overwhelming evidence of war crimes that violated humanity. The court specifically cited the order issued by the Gestapo in March 1944 by Kehrl to execute fugitive prisoners of war. The Nazi thugs inflicted even more brutal acts on Soviet prisoners of war, saying that the Germans established organized killing centers. Before the invasion of the Soviet territory, they formed special executioner groups. In one area of southern Soviet Union alone, one of these executioner groups solved the lives of 90,000 men, women, and children, which was at the beginning of the war. There was also a lot of evidence regarding economic plunder and looting of works of art.</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Judge Parker declared that Hitler had conscripted 25 million people in various countries to work for Germany, and the number of people indirectly benefiting the Nazi war economy totaled 35 million. Sokol said that of the 5 million people working in Germany, fewer than 200,000 were volunteers, and the circumstances of these workers were particularly inhumane.</p>
<p>It was also learned that Hess asked to leave the defendant's dock at 3:00 PM due to a stomachache.</p>
<p>The reason part of the court's judgment held that Schacht and Papen had not participated in the criminal plan, so the charges against them could be reduced. The court held that the opinion of the 22 defendants that they had foreseen the collective plan of "war crimes" or "crimes against humanity" could not be adopted.</p>
<h3>Six Million Jews Slaughtered; Incited Japan to Wage War Against the Allies</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] London, 30th (Broadcast): The Allied Military Court today ruled in the judgment that the Nazis had slaughtered six million Jews and that Ribbentrop had incited Japan to wage war against the Allied countries six months before the Pearl Harbor incident. The judgment ruled that the Nazis had indeed slaughtered six million Jews and that Ribbentrop had incited Japan to wage war against the Allied countries six months before the Pearl Harbor incident.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of War Criminals in Prison: Nazi Soldiers Regard Death as a Return Home; Ribbentrop is the Most Cowardly; Hess Spends All Day Studying Numerology</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 29th] The International War Crimes Tribunal held its last secret meeting today before announcing the verdict. In the prison where the war criminals lived, the guards and military police had been increased to a battalion and a company, totaling about 1,000 officers and soldiers. An official said that these guards and military police were closely monitoring the war criminals and protecting them from unapproved guests. At the same time, they were also strictly ensuring the safety of President Lawrence. Christian and Catholic clergymen today prayed for the defendants. Near the court, there was a heavily guarded house with about 50 court officials, including clerks, who were preparing the judgment. This secretarial work was performed by volunteers who had been approved. Before the verdict was announced, they were completely isolated from the outside world. At least two of the defendants had expressed their welcome to being sentenced to death. One was the Jewish executioner Streicher, who told a prison guard, "I am willing to die. At least I can close my eyes in peace and no longer have the guards outside disturbing my dreams all night." Funk, Hitler's economic advisor, also said, "Death is better than living in sin today." The superstitious Hess spent all day studying numerology in his room and issued a prediction, saying, "A miracle will surely appear when the verdict is announced." Since the trial began, Hess has been the most optimistic. Only one week after the trial began, he told a psychologist, "Death is unavoidable, but Nazi justice will never die with the death of the 20 leaders." Göring, Keitel, Jodl, Dönitz, Raeder, and others, who styled themselves as soldiers, all expressed that they regarded death as a return home. Except for Jodl and Raeder, all of them had asked their lawyers to apply to the Allied Control Council that if they were sentenced to death, they would request to be executed by firing squad. Nazi banker Schacht still claimed that the court had no right to sentence him, while Neurath was confident that he would receive a prison sentence. Ribbentrop was the most cowardly and dared not talk about the verdict.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Contacts Underway in Paris; Britain and the United States Decide to Support Turkey; Soviets Building Fortifications on the Turkish Border</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Paris, 30th (Broadcast from Istanbul): According to the "Tasvir" newspaper, the Soviet Union is building combat fortifications five kilometers deep along the Turkish border. Men and women over the age of 40 have been called to participate in the work. Heavy artillery, various types of launchers, and anti-aircraft artillery teams are deployed along the line, and exercises are held from time to time. The sound of the huge guns can be heard all along the border.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Responsible diplomatic officials here said today that Britain and the United States are expected to quickly discuss the Dardanelles issue and once again support Turkey. This is the most important development in international disputes since Stalin's statement on the 14th of this month, but there are no significant signs that relations between the major powers have worsened. Secretary of State Byrnes has exchanged preliminary views with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris. It is known here that Britain and the United States will firmly oppose the Soviet Union's expansion of military power in the Dardanelles and oppose direct negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. U.S. officials believe that this new direct negotiation between the Soviet Union and Turkey is tantamount to letting Turkey be at the mercy of the Soviet Union without the opportunity to resist the Soviet Union's demands.</p>
<h3>Martial Law Declared in Bombay</h3>
