<h3>陳參謀總長發表　告全國官兵書　闡述國防部成立的意義　及今後所應努力的途徑</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕參謀總長陳市面上上將一日宣誓就職，發表告全國官兵書。</p>
<p>全文如下：全國官兵同志，我政府國防部已於六月廿三日正式成立，今天是本部各級負責主官，奉命宣誓就職的一天，茲趁此機會，將本部成立的意義，過去掌經辦法的工作，當前急待完成的任務，以及今後所應努力的途徑，技要提出幾點，以供我全體官兵同志共同認讀與遵照。</p>
<p>第一，我們何以要成立國防部，成立國防部的意義何在？這一點誠前次出席樞紀念週時，業已有所報告，並已刋載各報，想各位同志，均已看到，各位須知一個現代國家，必須具備現代化的國防，始能夠獨立於世界，我國由於八年來對日抗戰所得的教訓與經騐，內應國家環境的需要，外合世界潮流的趨勢，在主席偉大魄力與遠大遠大眼光決策之下，並得美良好資料的參考，終於成立國防部，完成了中國劃時代的軍試探大改革，這一意義，是非常重大的，不僅展開另歷史上的新實，尤足象徵中國國防前途的光明。</p>
<p>對於此次軍事機構的改組，主席在還部前，曾有三點指示：（一）希望各級將領皆能以國家利益爲前提，依連勝目前及將來需要，實非調整軍事機構不可；（二）軍事機構之改組，完全以美國之軍事系統與組織爲原則；（三）限於本年五月底前改組完畢，此次中央原有的軍事機構，即是遵照這指示而實行改組，改組以後，各該原有業務，統交國防部繼續辦理，至於部內的各級編制，大部都已克定各極負責人員，並已陸續發表，自舊機構的改組，以至新機構　建立，所有業務，不能使其有一天的停頓，惟這裏尙有幾點，應予特別說明：</p>
<p>（一）國防部的立案精神，共有四點，（一）爲以政治軍依據歴次戰爭的羅騐，以政治軍對於國策之運用，國防之實施，最爲妥善，此種觀念在英美各國，尤爲普遍，此閃軍事機構之改組，撤銷與行政分立之軍事委員會，設立國防部改　行政院，即屬此意。（二）爲還軍於國，還寰球國乃本黨之一貫政策，此次成立國防部，即爲貫徹此咱政策，我國今後即將實行民主立憲，更不使這事機構以，再脫歸行政系統而獨立。（三）爲陸海空軍之統一指揮，現代戰爭，軍事本身之戰略及戰術，已構成陸海空軍之一體性，且因摩托住在軍事之結果，戰爭之突發性極大，爲謀應付緊急措施陸海空軍政軍令，不可不統一指揮，機構之改組即爲採取此制。（四）爲平戰兩時之適用，國防部之組織係以國家元首在戰時兼任陸海空軍大元帥，故此種組員進無論戰時平時均可適用，不至因突發戰事而無所適從。此次改制，具此四種精神，實爲樹立百年制度，奠定國家長治久安之基礎。</p>
<p>（二）國防部組織運用之特點有二：（一）操於政府，而軍事專門之「能」則屬於軍部，（二）三聯制體系的具體表現，國防部代表政府有權監督參謀，本部計劃知道各總司令部則負現執行實施，此實充分表現行政三聯制的精神。</p>
<p>（三）原有軍事機構改組，爲國防部的過渡辦法，分爲三個步驟：（一）第一個步驟原有機構的業務，未經完成者仍由原機構負責繼續處理；（二）第二個步驟按照新機構的業務，至原有機構的工作人員除已盡量編入新機構外，尙有編餘人員，均必妥爲安置，其詳細辦法與部隊人員安置辦法同，茲不再實。</p>

<p>各委員之意見</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕經濟部計劃委員會第一屆全體會第一次會議，由王主委雲五主席，卅六年度經濟部施政綱領，王氏就綱領全文廿條，逐條加以說明，並謂：全國經濟建設之政策，雖由最高經濟委員會決定，但經濟部富有初步之起草權，故特擬此綱領，請各委員指正。當有潘銘新，高叔康，王曉籟，胡厥文，楊蔭溥，伍啓元，吳蘊初等委員相繼發表意見，綜合要點：（一）全國經濟建設應分別數個區城推進，但此區域之劃分不必與當前之省區相同；（二）迅速釐訂工業會法；（三）經濟施政綱領積極方面，應與國內外當前局勢相適應，消極方面，應有稍「緊張」之字而規定，以挽救當前工商界之危機。此外，並有若干委員舉出：（一）新興工廠購置廠地，地價方面應有合理規定；（二）工業課稅應輕於商業，並酌量免稅，（三）廠商登記應由省政府辦理，避免層轉之煩；（四）加强保息制度之外，應進一步辦到「保利」及「保値」。等等意見，今日係側重原重則之討論、明日將就具體問題加以硏究。又關於工業會法，今日會塲中會有多人發言表示工業會決必需自現行商會法中分開，當經決定推定余各鈺，薛明劍，歐陽崙三委員舉行小組研究，將結果交大會決定後，送立法機關參　。</p>
<h3>一〇六歲壽婦　在蘇聯無疾而終</h3>

<h3>政院工程計劃團　考察路港工程　團長侯家源對記者談　兩路應裝置電氣信號</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據行政院工程計劃團團長侯家源稱：最近派遣至南方考察港口之工作人員業已回滬。該隊曾經過汕頭。廈門。福州等地。關於關內鐵路，及重要港口之情形，現正詳擬報吿中。該團現又派兩隊出發工作：其一考察黃河鐵橋；其一則至靑島，因靑島自接收後，有大量工程機械，須專家詳細加以檢查。該兩隊考察工作隊約於十日後即可回滬：關內之考察工作，屆時始吿全部完成。</p>
<p>侯氏又稱：全部工程煩重，急需進行修築者有三：（一）塘沾灣；（二）黃河鐵橋;　（三）京滬京杭甬鐵路。其中以塘沽港工程耗資最鉅，費時最久。而以兩路鐵路工程較為簡便。渠竭力主張兩路應裝置電氣信號，因電氣信號全部工程費僅需美金約三四百萬元，僅爲舖設雙軌費用的三分之一，而某運輸量則相等於雙軌。　此種電氣信號，能於列車行駛中途、自動以信號警吿上下行來往車輛，旣可免列車相撞之危險，又能節省過多之停站時間，兩路運輸即可賴此種裝置縮短行車時間，加多行駛車輛，從而增加運輸量。日該電氣信號，在美國·日本·台灣等地均已普通應用。</p>
<p>工　　境已將觀察結果，　具詳盡報告；送呈行政院，一經批准，工作即行開始。該團為配合工作需要，已委派在滬之美工程師諸斯（機車車輛工程師），費凡（電氣信號工程師），鐵脫司（港埠工程師），許納）鐵路工程師）等赴美採辦建築材料，定七月三日　機飛美。</p>

<h3>褚逆再審案</h3>
<p>其妻昨日投蘇高院　請求駁回檢察官抗吿</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州一日電〕褚逆民誼漢奸案，經蘇州高等法院裁定開始再審，翌日即為承辦檢察官李曙東提出抗吿，請求撤銷再審之裁定。現此項文卷，已呈最高法院作最後決定。褚　陳舜貞、復於一日上午九時許，投呈蘇高院，請求轉請最高法院駁回檢察官之抗吿，其理由略謂：國父　以陳炯明之變，致數年心血所成之各種草稿，悉被燬於砲火，引為痛恨，可見國父對手著之原稿，極爲重視，被吿保存其手著原稿，自必蒙嘉許，目國父自言　其　者，造福國家民族未可限量，則保存遺著者，自亦有利於民族，有利於國家，抗吿意旨均視為無足輕重，似非所以尊敬國父之道，其謂於人民無利益，與國父遺書實相違異，應請駁回抗吿。</p>

<h3>蘇聯自東北運去日俘　美估計達七十萬　均在西伯利亞充勞工</h3>
<p>美雖迭次質問蘇迄無正式答復</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕美國官方今日佔計：蘇聯殆已自中國東九省運送日軍七十萬人至西伯利亞充勞工。此種估計，係以戰爭結束後東九省日軍各部隊所有之軍事報吿為根據。美國雖迭次質問，但莫斯科方面迄無正式答復，此間當局認為此種情形，為國際種種摩擦之一。另有一事雖較為次要，亦為美蘇齟齬之跡象，即蘇聯拒絕美國在朝鮮北部蘇聯佔領區開設領事館是也。溯自戰爭結束以來，蘇聯在朝鮮南部美軍佔領區漢城設有領事館一處，美國在數月之談判中曾要求在北部蘇軍司令部所在城市平壤享有同樣特權，蘇聯即於數月以前撒消漢城領事館，以結束爭辯。</p>
<h3>蘇州監獄內刑事犯家屬　籲請速頒大赦令　呈文引今證古漢奸亦望獲赦</h3>

<h3>社論　經濟政策不能止於計劃</h3>
<p>經濟部新近選聘了一批經濟計劃委員，其間有不少工商界人士參與。昨天起，正在首都召開經濟計劃委員會，其主旨當然在釐訂一種完善的經濟方案。在這經濟恐慌，生產萎縮的嚴重關頭，經濟部能够召集會議，以謀集思廣益，比之袖手旁觀，一無動靜，總覺差强人意。不過我們以為國家的經濟政策，一個政府決不能以訂立計劃為盡其能事，換言之，經濟政策貴在實行，決不能止於計劃。</p>
<p>計劃，計劃，年來我們也聽得多，見得慣了，究竟有幾多計劃見諸實行，有幾多計劃行之有效，有幾多行之有效的計劃眞能福國利民？這些，實在値得朝野上下認眞檢討。所以，今天我們如因經濟計劃委員會的召開，而就欣然有喜色，以為目前的經濟危機就可解除，政府的經濟政策就可實現，似未免望之過奢，言之過早。何况此後的經濟計劃還有待於這個委員會來愼重討論，有無切實可行的方案釐訂出來，尙須俟事實證明。</p>
<p>說到關於經濟性質的會議，就我們所知，直接間接有關者，似已疊床架屋，應有盡有。第一，中樞有最高經濟委員會，業已成立，以行政院院長副院長為正副主席，其委員則包括五院院長，財政，經濟，糧食，農林，交通，社會等部部長，其性質則為全國經濟之最高計劃與監督機構，地位之高，權力之大，無待煩言。第二，行政院經常設立「安定財政緊急會議」，由宋院長親自主持，其主要任務為（一）決定貨幣政策，（二）平衡收支，（三）管理預算，（四）節約消費，（五）分配物資。這個會，名為財政會議，實則事事與經濟有關。第三，却要輪到現在經濟部召集的經濟計劃委員會了。我們不知道這委員會是否常設的會議機構，還是只開了一次會議就算了事；但無論如何，總似乎在鄭重其事的會議。即此，我們已看到三級的會議機構了，而况中央的决策機關，在目前的政制下還有高高在上的國防最高委員會與中央常會，可知決定計劃的會議機構，似已只嫌其多，不覺其少。而何以國家到了經濟危機如此嚴重的今日，還有待於經濟計劃的硏討？究竟這許多應負决策責任的會議機構，以往在幹什麽？</p>
<p>若說計劃應該不厭求詳嗎？計劃應該與人民代表共同商討嗎？那末，我們仍得先有兩點共同認識，就是：（一）計劃必須先定基本原則，若沒有原則，或雖有原則而束諸高閣，則計劃必苦無從談起。（二）一般人民代表則目前有國民參政會，工商代表則有各地工商法團的負責人，政府如果眞想勤求民隱，聽取人民對於經濟問題的意見，應該從這些機構裏去延攬人才。現在經濟部召集經濟計劃委員會，用意固極有可取，但我們更希望它能注意到這兩點，否則勢必形同敷衍，關於後者。聞上海市商會會員大會及全國商聯會籌備會已先後電呈政府，請從速召集全國經濟會議，以達成政府和人民眞能溝通意見，貫澈經濟政策之任務，這裏姑不具論。我們只說關於釐訂經濟計劃的先决條件。</p>
<p>經濟計劃的基本原則，其實政府早已確立。遠言之，有　孫中山先生的實業計劃，有　蔣主席手著「中國之命運」的提示，有三十三年十一月六日國防最高委員會第一四八次會議所通過的「戰後第一期經建原則」。近言之，有去年國民黨六全大會所通過的各種經濟政策的綱領，有今年三月間國民黨二中全會所通過的經濟緊急措施案。我們先要問：政府在勝利以來的十個月中，所有關於經濟的實際措施，究竟有沒有注意到政府早就定好的原則呢？還是縱有原則而已經事繁遺忘了呢？今天經濟危機如此深刻，所以釀成之者，究竟是因為沒有方案呢？還是因為許多設施往往違反了原定的方案呢？這點不弄淸楚，不要說此次經濟計劃委員會開會，未必能開出什麼結果，就算再擴大一些召集了全國經濟會議，也勢將決而不行，等於不議。政府未來的經濟措施，依然是計劃歸計劃，事實歸事實，兩不相顧，各行其是，縱有大好的經濟政策，亦祇見其終於在「計劃來，計劃去」中間繞着圈子而已！</p>
<p>姑舉一例，以證明所言之容非過分。譬如國營民營事業之劃分，求之於　中山先生之遣敎，　主席之指示，與第一期經建原則之規定，則普通的工商業並未只許以國家資本壟斷囊括，而不讓民營。但最近除紡織蠶絲這些輕工業大部已由國營而外，甚至連台灣運來的糖也改為只許政府獨占販賣；這究不知根據什麼原則計劃出來的？而最奇怪的，未歸政府所設的公司獨占販賣以前，由同業經銷，台糖市價始終在每包五萬元以內，而一旦劃歸國營，不久就漲到十一萬元以上，究竟為什麼要這樣幹？無論如何，政府在此時的經濟計劃，總不應該向着用壟斷方式領導漲價這方針走吧。然而目前事實之所表現者已如此，將來還會有什麽更好的計劃訂出來呢？就使有了好計劃，又安知事實上將怎樣辦呢？經濟問題，至今還讓我們只聽見會議，只看見計劃，也難怪經濟危機的一天深一天了！</p>

<h3>投彈一霎那閃光濃烟真衝霄漢巨聲隆隆驚心動魄　但並未引起地震海嘯</h3>
<p>〔路　煽動紐約卅日電〕原子彈已於格林威治廿二點零三分（上海間星期一晨七時零三分）在比基尼珊瑚島投下爆炸，散囊濃烟爲這二萬呎之廣，全島均爲濃烟所掩蔽，中央呈現鮮明之橋黃色，全島即消失於烟·火·水之中，烟柱有五萬呎高，船隻多艘即　火延燒，五分鐘後始　見船形。超級無綫電，觀察機已被炸毀，數分鐘後飛機騰入雲中偵查，無綫電操縱之魚雷聽亦即駛入該島無綫電活動之洋而內觀察。一百四十哩以外之觀察員可　見爆炸情形。據在原子彈爆炸之處最近之哥倫比亞廣播公司訪員　斯　：爆炸時並不感覺震動，亦不見海嘯。本社訪員報告稱：該彈在五十秒鐘內爆炸，兩分鐘後始聞薩薩之聲，該彈稍偏於目標，蓋「長門」號在烟散後仍能望見。</p>
<p>無人飛機安然降落</p>
<p>〔聯合社　加林晨一日電〕白朗第廣播我：「雲霧之漂　一如預料，但對於任何人或其里連各島並無危險。」據報：全部無綫電控制之無人　讓穿過毒霧，以測量原子彈　射能，均已安然降落。白氏證明轟炸長崎之原子彈較轟炸廣島者更當於效力及破壞力。謂「在判明一切絕對安全之前，不准任何　人入礁湖。」</p>
<p>據檀香山息：夏威夷　對今晨原子彈爆炸，並未測得何項記錄。</p>
<p>據原子彈試騐副懷念柏遜斯稱：此次爆炸可和千噸之炸彈相等，稍後可由被炸區域傷器測知。惟此種懷孕當守秘密。據阿派拉欽號記者船某訪員報告：原子彈投下後數分鐘，礁湖上即湧起　原黑烟、自黑　鏡中之望之，閃光甚淡，恰如遙遠之閃電，旋見　窄之粉紅色整齊毒霧，急急上昇。約九十秒鐘後　　隆隆之　，一如雷雨或遙遠之海軍砲聲。在雷霆銀幕上，可靶子　「尼伐達」號及日艦「長門」號，並可見空母「獨立」號正在起火。</p>
<p>據空中飛機廣播：炸彈之爆發顯與目標稍有的距離，偏向航空母艦「獨立」號，其上　構造似已炸地一部份，阿派拉欽號離爆炸處十五哩，亦報告炸彈未中目標，位於中曲之主力艦「尼伐達」　預定作爲靶子艦者。爆發後在　　外仍能望見。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕遠東國際法庭檢查法庭檢查官，今日向庭上提出日政府文件一份，證明被審之日戰犯中，曾與以前極端國家主義派黑龍會發生關係，參加該會之團均詳列無遺。其中有一團體，係以前日前首相小磯谷昭及前陸相青木。據證人宇垣一成一再南瓜稱，關於日本陸軍之統制，除日皇外，應以參謀總長之權力爲最大，被告律師曾反覆質問宇垣，冀能證明南次朗確屬無力遏止一九三一年東北事變之擴大。此外一九三六年曾任岡田內閣內相三日之後藤文夫，亦自巢鴨監獄提出到庭對質。後藤於其供詞中稱，一九四〇年與近衛合作，成立大政翼寶會之某一社團，橋本欣五郎即爲其中一社員。自大政翼寶會成立後，日本即無其他重要政黨及社團存在。大政翼實會之目的，爲在日本成立一個政團，整個由政府統制。大政翼寶會受政府津貼，每一地方皆有分會。辦護律師質問後藤時，法庭旁聽者感覺其發問未能皆要。首席法官練勃旋訊問後藤，後藤供稱，大政冀贊會係爲幫助日本民衆盡其對國家責任。魏勃即問，日本民衆對國家責任爲何？後藤供稱，即日本民衆必須履行之責任。詢以所指責任是否包括軍事在內，答是。橋本欣五郎之日篇辦護律師，叩以大政冀贊會之目的，不否係在鼓動日本人民引起此次不合法及不人道之戰事。答稱，該會目的並非如此。魏勃後曾宣稱，該會似爲假手政府官員統制民衆之機關。</p>

<h3>吳局長談糧食管理　決不畏米商威脅　市府直接配糧給米店</h3>
<p>一面仍將督促米行業採購　如有不願營業決吊銷執照</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局吳局長昨日宣稱：南北二米巿塲，於本月三日即將成立，故社會局新設之糧食管理科，亦已加緊籌備，務期於三日前可以正式辦公，該科科長已內定由蔣局專員吉明齊兼任。</p>
<p>對於以後糧食管理辦法，吳局長稱：過去糧食部往往有米即拋，遂致該部之米，悉入米商之手，有時竟由一家米商全部承購，似未妥善。以後將田市府將米直接配給各米號，使中間少一層米行業之剝削。故此次管理與以前不同之處，即在前係無限制之拋售，而今為有限制之分配。</p>
<p>以後米號業應先向社會局登記，然後由該局視各米號營業情形，而定分配數量。該局並將隨時調查各米號存米數量，以便作合理之調劑。該局與米行業雖不再發生關係，然仍將督促彼等採購。彼等將來仍可將其採購之米向巿塲拋售，但與政府不生關係。</p>
<p>以前米行業反對限價，確有要挾政府情形，且有表示不願蝕本，寗可不營米業者，對此等表示不願繼續營業之米商，政府已決定吊銷其執照。產區米價，向係視上海市價而上落，上海米價旣無高漲情形，產區自無價格反高之理由，目前癥結，實在於產區之米，早已入於米商之手。社會局已決定派員赴蘇州·無錫·常熱·松江·金山·常州等產區調查，上海米商是否有人收購？收購之數量若何？米商買到食米之後，往往放置鄕間，因轄區不同，巿府無權過問，惟上次江蘇省王主席來滬時，市府已與王主席商洽，王主席已表示願加協助。</p>
<p>七八二月之中，米糧確較困難，然市府現正就貢米洋米之中設法，深信必有辦法。米商現在確正與政府鬥法，魄力亦頗可觀，然市府殊不畏此等威脅也！</p>
<p>現在配出之七千餘石，均係上白，如間有不能買到情事，恐仍有奸商作崇情事。亟望檢舉，以便查究。將來受到配給之米店，應將米價標出，否則停配。配到後而拒售者，必予嚴懲。現在限價為每石四萬六千元，加百分之六利潤，及若干運費，米商雖有要求增價者，但巿府已決定仍維原價，不予變更。至需要食米較多，以致無從向米號買到足額食米之政府機關·學校·訓練所等，政府可以配給。工廠及規模較大之公司商號，則由社會局發給採辦證，採辦地區可由彼等自己指定，現已有紗廠數家，向社會局提出申請。</p>
<p>糧政處之米，目前尙未送至社會局。吳局長表示，「要交出則須全部交出」，按該處除存米外，尙有麵粉廠等資產。至於糧食部徐部長來滬後接洽情形，吳局長謂彼並無所知，僅知徐部長正與市長商談中。</p>
<h3>長江三泰存米　分配米店情形</h3>
<p>當局為維持民食起見，經將對存之長江三泰等存米，分配於各米號，以供門售之食米；前日為星期日，此項工作亦未停止，至昨日中午始分配完竣。當時蘇州北路中國銀行堆棧門前，人頭擁擠，均係米號夥友等候出貨。聞此次分配之食米，完全為蘇州無錫常熟松江等地所產之上等白米，共分配全巿米號八百七十三家，每家可領到十石至十五石。</p>
<h3>今晨地檢處　偵訊糧貸案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧貸案迄今仍由軍事司法兩機關分別辦理中。今晨地檢處將再開偵查庭，惟汪達人·任星崖·吳蓉生·王巽之均仍羈押於警備司令部。該部日前行文會計師公會派員協助審核糧商賬目，迄昨日止尙未請到。惟糧食部之覆文業已遁達。據悉汪達人口供中涉及糧部各點均係事實云。</p>
<h3>徐堪談話　川贛米陸續加緊下運　田賦徵實地方稅收有增　糧貸案自有公正裁判</h3>
<p>糧食部部長徐堪氏昨談：（一）此次奉宋院長電令來滬，商滬巿民會，連日秉承院長指示，與吳巿長多次會商，對於增厚米源，穩定價格，管理巿塲諸端，均有具體決定。本部由蔡鍔輪江與輪運濟之川贛米三萬石，業於六月廿九·三十兩日相繼到埠，仍多方增加運輸力，陸續由川贛源源下運，幷購運洋米，俾滬巿食糧，供需平衡。（二）本年田賦業仍徵實，係二中全會所決定，在財糧會萬中不過討論實施之辦法而已，自財政收支系統法改定以後，田賦徵實關係地方財政較重，中央僅得三成，省縣則共得七成，故各省田糧機構及徵糧業務，均自七月一日起劃歸省府主管，糧食部僅居於監督考核之地位。（三）糧食之決策與辦法，實經詳細之考慮，經辦人員有無棄職貪汚行為，商人有無違法及弊端，旣經糾舉，現併由軍法司法審理，自有公正之裁判云</p>

<h3>鄭用之　葉淺予　司徒慧敏　赴美考察電影事業</h3>
<p>電影界同人昨日舉行茶會歡送</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國電影界同人，昨午後三時假新生活俱樂部，舉行茶話會歡送鄭用之·葉淺予·司徒慧敏赴美考察電影事業。到羅靜予·史東山·袁叢美·趙丹·白楊·封禾子·張光宇·丁聰·康健等影劇及文藝界人物約六七十人。郭沫若亦來，匆匆簽名題詩後，匆匆的又走了，說是還要途曾昭倫去。茶會由羅靜予主席，並由羅學濂·熊佛西等致歡送詞，熊氏說：「美國電影技巧無疑地已登峯造極，然而意識和方向是尙有可議的。」他希望「中國未來的電影事業應該發展到民間去，應成為大衆所共享的。」史東山指出美國的一切像水，應用不當，可能成為黃河，只產生泛濫與破壞的作用，他希望能成為「西湖」。白楊小姐的話很簡短，她以情脆甜柔的聲音祝三位旅人「一帆風順」。</p>
<p>繼由鄭·葉·司徒三氏致吿別詞。鄭用之氏以前是中國製片廠廠長，此次係奉政府之命赴美考察電影行政，鄭氏略謂：抗戰八年中大後方的八百餘個電影工作人員歷盡了艱險困苦，有的更犧牲了生命，以陋劣的工具，攝製了近百部影片。但在配合抗戰上說來，其實是不够的，因此他願借他山之石以切磋。他希望赴中的人不僅是去看看，更要切身體騐，實地去工作，末了並指出美國電影事業的三個時期：戰前是商業資本期，戰時是政府統制期，以後應該長民族工業家共同努力的民主工業時期了。</p>
<p>葉淺予是中國名漫畫家之一（也即漫畫人物「王先生」的創造者）抗戰期中，他一直苦苦地埋頭作畫，曾為了搜集畫材，遂赴西康與印度。今年五月中旬，他接到了美國務院的聘書，定期一年，要他將中國的現代漫畫介紹新大陸去。同時也受了「中製」的囑託，考察好萊塢的電影卡通製作。他的心境，自謂「很矛盾」。他說：「在目前中國一切問題都無法解決的時候，赴美似乎不無逃避現實之嫌。」他私心是頗願留在這裏跟友人們並肩苦幹的；但是「事實上，躭在這裏又有什麼可幹呢？」深沉的語意顯示了他內心的苦悶。不寗靜的生活環境似乎已使每一文化工作者的情緒變得感傷而痛苦。</p>
<p>司徒慧敏是以「個人的關係去的」，「中製」給他的任務是硏究導演技術。他將先到加拿大的沃太華看看紀錄電影的新進展。他說：「我的身心俱已貢獻給這一事業，願意在這方面為中國的民主富强而永遠努力。」</p>
<p>鄭用之氏將於當晚登「梅格將軍」號航輪，明晨首途赴美。葉與司徒二人則以船位未辦妥，延至二週後啟程。</p>
<p>五時許，茶會在歡洽的空氣中結束。門外的滂沱大雨暫時的留住了依依惜別的朋友們。</p>

<h3>救濟蘇北難胞　各界響應　二十萬萬隨募隨解</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇北難民救濟協會上海市籌募委員會，昨日假座浦東同鄉會，招待本巿新聞界，到該會副主委吳開先，總幹事王先靑及各報社記者三十餘人。首由吳開先氏報吿，略謂蘇北難民之救濟，實為艱巨之工作，難民人數，據佔計約達三百萬之多，流離失所，衣食不周，其中毫無親友援手，急待賑濟者，亦達百萬，彼等現散居於徐州，海州，通州，泰懸，揚州，鎮江及本市等處，鎮江最多，約二十萬人，已成立招待所二十七處，難由江蘇省政府與行總加以救濟，而數量甚少，二月來所得到了救濟，每五月僅能合得麺粉一袋，尚不如上海失業工人所獲之豐。月前除青年難胞，已設有青年訓練班加以訓練並介紹職業外，婦孺老弱，行將成為餓莩。上海籌募委員會王委杜月笙氏，已發願籌款二十億，自七月一日起，至八月三十一日止，隨募隨解鎮江，因救災如救火，不容稍緩也。</p>
<p>現在工作情形，約如下列數端：（一）杜月笙氏已先向本市十四家銀行，免息籌借五億，一二日內即可滙出。（二）杜月笙章行嚴及本人等曾招待名伶名票，擬請義演十日，均表允諾，地點已定天蟾舞台。（三）本星期內，本巿各廣播電台，亦將加入勸募。（四）除上述各團體外，全巿舞廳從業員與舞女，亦自動樂助，擬捐一天全部收入，不除開銷加惠災黎。語至此時，吳局長以詼諧之口吻謂：「本人從不跳舞，但這一天却希望大家多去跳跳，多吃一點東西，須知他們不吃，難民也沒有吃了；他們不跳舞，難民要跳河！」吳稚老已允致書市長，請巿府亦豁免是日舞廳之娛樂捐，俾災民更多受惠。</p>
<p>該會現成立勸募總隊八隊，下設分隊，不限數目，正進行組織中。並委金城，交通，江蘇，新華，江蘇農民，中國通商等六銀行收款，凡慷慨解囊之諸大善士，可逕至此六銀行付款，將來即由此六行將所有捐款，掃數解鎮，至上海各項辦公費用，悉由發起人墊付，決不動用捐款。後由王先靑致謝，略請籌募動機，全係由於人道主義人類互助之博愛精神，深信必能早獲成果，至此，遂於狂風暴雨中散會。</p>

<h3>論區公所的地位　和區長的職權</h3>
<p>— 張曉崧</p>
<p>現在有人認爲有警察局的分局了，又設區公所，未免架床　　，且保甲之組織指導，戶口之調查管理，警局自可辦理設置區公所是多餘的；又有人以僞　保合一，使保甲與警察打成一片，變成爲完全警治，以警察來管理自治機構，與地方自治的目的不符，所以區頌揚是要的，但區公所只能算是一個辦理保甲與遷舉的單位，假使區公所一面要辦理保甲及選舉等事，一面又要辦理行政事務，便與各局的行政系統職權範圍起衝突了。</p>
<p>上面兩種見解，都是錯誤的，我們要使大家明瞭區公所的地位，　區長的職權，不必多所引證，　不必多談理論，我們就拿市組　法來一研究，就可明白。</p>
<p>市組織法第六條：「市以下爲區，區內之編制爲保甲……」這就　說明了區的地位，牠是構成市組織的，介於市府與保甲中間的　種地位。</p>
<p>市組織法第三十四條約：「區設區頌揚，置區長一人，副區長一人，由區民代表會選舉之，受市政府之監督指揮，辦理本區自治事項及執行市政府委辦事項。」這就是說明區長的職權，受市政府　　監督指揮，一方面的辦理本區的自治事項，一方面是執行市府委辦事項。</p>
<p>由於市組織法第十一條的明文規定，區公所是市組成的一個居於市府與保甲間的機構，與警察局的分局不同；就三十四條明文規定區長的職權亦有明確的說明，區公所之設置不僅是沒有架床疊屋的　病，是一個辦理地方自治，和執行市府命令的重要機構，證明牠不是　純的一種只辦選舉的機關。</p>
<p>我們相信，市政府的工作對象，一切與利革弊，都爲的是市民，而市民的組織是保甲，地方自治　層的民意機構的是保民大會，在區的又有區民代表會，區長又是由區民代表會的選舉而產生一方對區民代表會負責，同時他還要指導全區保甲的自治業務。因此凡是有利於市民的，經過保民大會區民代表會之決議，只要不與中央法令及市法令牴觸者，他都是有執行的義務。</p>
<p>還有一點要說明的，就是區公所接受區民代表會之決議，或接受保民大會及保甲長之建議，與辦自治事務時，如關於衛生的，當然要呈報衛生局，關於地政的，當然要呈報地政局，關於公用工務的，當然要呈報公用工務局，關社會福利的，當然要呈報社會局，其餘各局，均可類推。依據職權，市政府各局認爲不必要，或與法令抵觸者不予批准，或令修正外，與辦各事，各局均有指揮監督之權，又有什麼衝突呢？</p>
<p>我們站在公務員的立塲上，在目前的民主時代，應該自己來考慮一下，過去我們官府包　政治，不讓人民法做，我們得到的政治效率，究有若何？我們相信，人民的力量是無窮的，人民自己來辦理自治事項，與他們有切身的利害關係的事，我相信一定辦得快而且好，只要我們加以監督指揮，何必不容許他們自己去做呢？</p>
<h3>各區區民代表會　定本月五日前召開</h3>
<p>本市各區區民代表，本年四月間即行選出，嗣因各當選代表公職檢　多數均未送審，致未能召開成立會。據悉市府爲積極建立基層民　機構，以期地方自治工作能順利推行起見，已令飭各區區公所於本年七月五日以前，先行召開區民代表成立會，選舉代表會主席，並繼續召開第一次代表會議，研討各區應與應革改進事項。</p>
<h3>敵僞徵田賦糧食　各區定期開辦登記</h3>
<p>收復區在淪陷期間被敵僞徵收之出賦糧食，依照　　出賦實　辦法第三條，准由人民　同完　憑證甲請登記，以使對敵清算　價。本市規定自七月十五日起至九月十五日止，二個月爲登記期限·凡在第十四·廿二·廿三·廿四·廿五·廿六·廿九·三十·三十一·九區，由保甲按三分發登記表，糧戶接到登記表，塡送保甲層轉財政局登記。其餘各區糧戶於登記期內，自向財政局申請登記。昨民政處已分函各區頌揚，認眞辦理。</p>
<h3>十八區選舉訴訟　—魏裕農敗訴—</h3>
<p>本市第十八區選舉參議員，該區當選候補第三名參議員魏裕農，控告區公所辦理選舉違法舞弊一案，法經上海地方法院審訉，選舉票，昨始宣判魏裕農之訴駁間，訴訟費用由原告負担。</p>
<p>茲據民政處負責人宣稱，此次辦理市參議員選舉，共發生選舉訴訟八案，除兩案由原告人撤回外，其餘六案，均經上海地方法院審訉判決。整個選舉，業經確定有効，一俟內政部核定公交到市，即可召開成立大會。</p>
<h3>翁建光逝世</h3>

<h3>第九區實行　清潔大掃除</h3>
<p>本市第九區，地處西郊，環境衛生，較遜於他區，日來疫勢猖　，該區姚區長爲促起居民注意清潔衛生，防止疫病蔓延起見，特定本月二日舉行全區大掃除運動，屆時除保甲工作人員全體出動督導外，並分函警察分局，及衛生所清潔隊，協助勸導云。</p>
<h3>戶籍法施行細則（二）</h3>
<p>（第八條）辦理戶口調查，應由省政府或由省政府令飭縣政府，訂定調查日，戶口調查開始前，應先編組保甲，已組織保甲之縣，得於戶口調查時整理保甲次第，但保之編制，經確定後，非得省政府核准，不得變更，編組或整理保甲，應於調查日前十日完成。</p>
<p>（第九條）保甲編制以戶爲單位，十戶爲甲，十甲爲保；有增减之必要時，得以六戶至十五戶爲甲，六甲至十五甲爲保。</p>
<p>市之保甲編制，十戶至三十戶爲甲，十甲至三十甲爲係。</p>

<h3>處理原子彈問題　是人類智慧的最好試騐</h3>
<p>— …本報編譯室…</p>
<p>原子彈的發明，使人類站在歷史的十字路口：一條路可以通到更大的繁榮，進步，生活水準的再提高，各民族關係的更越密切，由目前的世界飛躍到原子能的世界；另一條路可以通到更深的犯忌，仇視，生命的集體毀滅，文化的普遍遭殃，讓人類所發明的東西殘殺人類。我們究竞走那一條路呢？這要　人類的智慧來抉擇了。</p>
<p>現在的問題，就是人類怎樣來處理原子彈？怎樣來處理因原子彈的發明而造成的世界大局？綜合各方的報道，由聯合國機構來管制厚子能的主張，已經成爲當今最普遍的思想，發明原子彈的科學家，對於管制原子彈一點，態度尤其積極。</p>
<p>關於國際管制原子能問題，目前有兩種基本的假完：（一）各國必須允許聯合國機帶的監察員自由進人其領土，不受任何限制；（二）各國放射性原索的生產，和使用必須由政府獨佔，因此聯合國機構監察員可以　中其注意力，不必分散到各方面去。</p>
<p>但是世界各國是否願意照辦，確乎大成問題。譬如說，蘇聯能夠允許聯合國監察員毫無約束進入其領土麼？美國願意限制放射性原素的生產，而不用於民生工業方面來提高人民生活的水凖麼？事實上，豈僅美蘇兩國如此，其他許多國家也是一樣，所以要達到這個目的，距離還相當遙遠。</p>
<p>其次，就是各國同意國際管制原子能，在這一代或者下一代是否可以避免原子彈戰爭呢？答案也是否定的。因爲所謂管制，不過是監督各國政府不製造原子彈或者其他原子武器，而將原子能使用於工業方面或者在實騐室中進行研究工作，還是可以的。根據科學家的意見，製造放射性物質的技術，旣不秘密，亦不困難，在未來十年中，至少有八個或者十個國家可以生產放射性物質。假定在十年或者十五年之後，世界若干國家中已有原子能工廠，這些工廠或者由國際管制，或者受聯合國機構監督，保證其中所生產的放射性物質的確是用來發生能量，決不生產原子炸彈。再假定各國確無原子彈而依　保持飛機，火箭，海軍，炸彈，常備軍。但是爲了國際政治的基本問題並沒有解決，局勢依然可以惡化，而到兵戎相見的程度。戰爭一旦開始，一切國際管制，自然立即瓦解。在這種情形之下，各國就可以利用已往在工廠和實騐室中所獲得的有關原子能的知識立即著手製造原子彈至多在幾個月之後，就可以達到目的。所以國際管制原子能就是完全成功，也不過是一種拖延的辦法，並不是根本解決。</p>
<p>那麼在這一代或者下一代中究竟沒有避免原子戰爭的希望呢？答案是希望極少。人類生產破壞性工具的能力，已經完全超過了創造政治管制工具的能力，彷　　像龜兔賽跑一　。</p>
<p>唯一防止未來戰禍的辦法，就是除了國際管制原子能之外，聯合國機構必須擁有一般國家所有不能製造者使用的武器，包括原子彈在內。世界上一有侵略事件發生，那麼不論其性質如何，聯合國機構立刻要有力量去加以阻止。假如要聯合國機構眞能發揮作用，那麼個別國家的否決權也必須予以取消，因此安全理事會可作迅速而有効的行動。換言之，一方面要有一個具有實力的世界政府，而另一方面各國在監督之下，必須實行解除武裝。</p>
<p>人類必須打開進步的大門。如何處理原子彈這個問題，的確是人類智慧最好的試騐。世界未來的命運，並非決定於神明，而是決定於人類的方寸之間。（節譯自“Harper”雜誌）</p>
<h3>原子彈試騐的準備</h3>
<p>— …本報資料室…</p>
<p>美國陸海空軍當局爲測知原子炸彈的爆炸力及其對海軍的影響，原定於王月十五日在太平洋中馬紹爾羣島比尼基港聯合舉行原子彈轟炸軍艦的試騐，嗣爲便利更多議員前往參觀起見（這是白宮新聞秘書羅斯的解釋），展期至七月一日在比尼基珊瑚島　近舉行。該島長約二十一哩，聞約十一哩，島上土民祇有一百六十七人，經投票表決，願意　東方一百三十五哩的隆基列克島，從二月下旬就開始疏散。</p>
<p>原子彈試騐的程序經規定如下：第一次炸彈將在停泊的日　艦上面數百呎處爆炸。第二次炸彈將在水平面爆炸，預料將繳起高達百呎的海潮，致成最大的損壞。第三次炸彈在水底下幾千呎處爆炸，壓力將使船身內陷。</p>
<p>試騐時將出美國第五〇九混合航空隊的B-29型飛行堡壘參加，此項飛機無人駕駛，將藉無綫電控制自行起飛，盤旋，降落。準備在試騐時受攻擊的艦艇，戰艦，驅逐艦，巡洋艦，運輸艦，登陸艇，潛水艇等，德國巡洋艦「友琴親王」號和日本無畏艦「長門」號也包括在內。艦艇上當然沒有人類，但安放各種兵器如飛機，大砲，坦克，活動雷達和無綫電設備，並爲試騐原子彈對生物的影響起見，將裝載豬鼠牛羊等動物，以代活人。同時珊瑚島上將安置自動紀錄的機器人。以使作種種測騐。</p>
<p>試騐原子彈時，外國人准許參觀的，僅以聯合國機構原子能委員會各代表僞限，該會代表除美國外，包括中·英·法·蘇·加·澳·埃·荷·墨西哥等國。新聞記者約二百人准許在　距八哩至十哩的船上參觀。在四週圍觀的艦船約有一百五十艘。舉行試騐時，美國若干主要報導機構代表，將藉　聞無綫電及攝影，將試騐全部經過，迅速傳播至世界各地。</p>
<h3>原子彈試騐攝影</h3>
<p>昨日在太平洋比基尼珊瑚島上舉行的原子彈試驗，可能成爲許多年以來有記錄的最好科學試驗。原子彈爆炸的情形將以遠距離控制的和長列的攝影機從各種角度攝影，有照片和雷影。有從飛機上攝製的，有從固定的某一點攝製的。無線電控制的照相機安置在一百呎高的塔上，這些塔重量以支持原子彈爆炸所引起的風的力量，它們將不至設在比離日　地五哩到十哩以外更遠的地方，照相機都放在厚鉛做牆的房子裏，而且每架相機還要放在密閉而不能爲水浸濕的盒子裏。攝影的工作是穿過窗洞作的，這空子在爆炸以後會自動的關起來，以避免放射綫對膠片所起的作用。</p>
<p>爲了原子彈炸所發出的極高度的熱，照相機需要有特殊的保護裝置。照相機的透鏡上面將蒙上一層薄膜。由於光的作用，這薄膜將在爆炸的閃光以後被除去。所以需要這層薄膜的原因恐怕爆炸所發出的熱量會透過透鏡，使得不致菁火的膠片也會因達到燎購而熔化。</p>
<p>攝影記錄的結果，要到試驗以後幾個星期才知道，放射線的作用阻止人們接近攝影塔。被稱爲費爾柴爾德雷達照相機（Fairchild　Radar　Cameras）所攝的照片可以較早得到，因爲它是在遠距離控制的飛機上或者在三萬呎的上空的普遍飛機上照的。（美新聞處）</p>

<h3>原子彈舊案重提</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室稿</p>
<p>廣島被襲</p>
<p>去年八月五日，美國陸軍上校狄拔芝駕駛B29型飛行堡壘，用降落傘拋下第一顆原子彈原子炸彈在日本廣島上，產生了爲驚世人的效果。當那桂直沖雲霄，高達二萬英尺。據社魯門總統的報告，這顆炸彈的轟炸力勝過二萬噸的TNT猛烈炸藥。</p>
<p>長崎遭殃</p>
<p>八月九日的侵晨，另外一架B29型超空堡壘在日本長崎投下第二顆原子炸彈。據目擊當時情景的英國空軍大隊長契夏亞的記述，當那顆炸彈爆炸的一瞬，他祇覺得他所乘坐的那架觀察飛機突然受到猛烈的碰撞，同時覺得機身外面的世界照亮得異乎尋常，他向外張望時，只見一個可怕的大火球，估計它的溫度該有攝氏一千萬度，隨着就有一根钜大無比的灰色烟桂，頂着那火球直沖上空，離地面約有五千英尺，火柱內烈熖旋轉飛騰，並且一直在噴火。那火球運柱繼續向上飛騰噴火，直到二分鐘後已高達二萬英尺，柱頂上的火球已變成透明的硫磺色，烟柱下端的黑烟，向四面擴散，和受災地面的塵土混成一片。這時廣大的地面烯　熊熊烈火，很快的延燒開去。在爆炸後廿分鐘，那烟火柱已升到六萬英尺萬處，外形漸　模　面盛大團雲　。下面整個的長崎被毀滅於烟火之中</p>
<p>炸後慘象</p>
<p>被炸後的廣島已變成一片焦土的廢墟，綠草不生，樹幹猶似焦炭。距原子彈爆炸地點兩英里以外，各種車輛均被轟炸震動，拋出於地面一千英尺以上後重　地面，變成一堆廢物。釀造所裏面所存儲的千萬玻璃瓶，已被高熱熔爲液體，流到低地，變成了玻璃池塘，長崎因有小由將市區分隔，被害情形較廣島爲輕。在被炸區域內，工廠的銅鐵殘骸，東倒西歪。雜亂堆積。</p>
<p>原子怪病</p>
<p>又廣島及長崎受原子彈轟炸的居民，雖不立時死亡，往往有延至數星期後斃命的。據專家報告：多數居民受原子彈爆炸的鐳錠式光綫照射，深入骨髓中血管組織，全部血液作用被破壞，血液不復凝結，白血球消失，細菌猖獗，羅難者終於兩三星期內斃命。此外又有許多人得到所謂「原子病」的怪病，如脫髮·齒落·焚灼·神經錯亂·婦人病·紫斑·大量流血等。最奇怪的，有月經不調的婦女若干人，均被原子彈暴風所治療。</p>
<h3>一波甫平·一波又起！　港發生余兆祺案　我國法又遭遇一種新試煉</h3>
<p>— 六月廿九日香港航訊　特約記者林友蘭</p>
<p>一個國家的法令和別個國家的法令，固不相同，而一個國家的法令和別個國家的殖民地的法令，其間有很大的距離，亦勢所必然者。因此，雙方必須互相諒解，互相拿重，在「不同」之中，力求其「同」，任何一方面，不應專前存有「獨行其是」，以法治爲名而「不法」爲實，甚至有由意　護有損害對方主權的人物或做成損害對方主權的事件，然後可以尋求合作之道，並增強彼此的友誼。自從　蔣委員長以中國戰區最高統帥的地位命令英海軍少將夏　代表接受香港日軍投降後，香港的情形，有新的蛻變，詎重返香港的若干英國官員，却漠視了當前的現實，依然迷　其昔日統治殖民地的伎倆，對我國在香港的新地位，似有不勝嫉妬之感。港府當局與我駐港軍政人員直接發生摩擦而間接對中英邦交發生不良影響的事，已時有所聞，尤以最近的國民日報被勒令停刋事件，最爲顯著。記者對該事件的始末，曾有詳細報導，諒已爲國內人士所悉。茲在港府開明之士爲珍重中英友誼而半途開放國民日報禁令後不及兩日，又發生一件「余兆祺事件」，試就其經過，爲關心香港問題的同胞告：</p>
<h3>維持軍風紀　粵行營飭捕余兆祺</h3>
<p>廿六日，本報告各大報刋出一條消息稱：「軍事委員會參議余兆祺，以一軍人身份，在港經營閣業，觸犯陸軍法規。廣州行營張主任據報，爲維持軍風紀，昨特電令駐港九軍專督察員郭納祺少將押粵查辦。」郭少將奉令後，怎樣辦理呢？據廿八日郭少將對往訪的國民日報記者說：</p>
<p>「本人（郭自稱）於本月廿三日接奉張主任電令，着即津捕余兆祺解省訊辦，本人常即奉令執行，當日通知余氏至本人住宅一敘。余氏隨如時到訪，本人乃告知余氏，謂張主任來電，着即普省候命。渠聞言後，即案取電報一閱，閱後遂詢本人對此事如何綹電。本人乃渠於豎日（即廿四）乘搭西安輪赴者，渠當時同意首肯，但謂因在港私事未了，請准過港一行，本人即着駐九寵憲兵連長監視其行動。詎渠由港返半島酒店臥室後，渠之臥室外，即有英國憲兵巡演遷看守，渠並嚴著暫不　赴省。本人聞訊，即對該英憲兵謂，此乃我軍風紀問題，應由我憲兵加以監視。我憲兵及英憲兵均守於余氏之門外。無何英憲兵隊長謂本人道歉，謂此乃奉上峯命令實看守余氏。是晚三時左右，本人方　睡中，英陸軍司令菲士廷將軍派專輪來接本人，說有要事相請，本人即渡海至英陸軍司令部。時除菲士廷將軍外，復有港輔致司麥道高及一西人在座。渠等與本人談及余兆麒之事，謂余氏現已離職，係屬普通平民性質，應援用引渡辦法，復取出余氏本年三月這免職書以證明。本人當即解釋我國陸軍制度，分『官』『職』兩種，『職』則臨時可以調遣或免，而『官』乃屬官階屬永遠性質，除因故被革除官階或已奉令退伍外，均屬我國軍人。時雙方研究爭持至午夜四時，本人以未得要領，爲明瞭責任起見，關於看管余氏之責任問題，提出意見。時非士廷將軍要求由英方看管，本人以由何方看管，均無成見，但手績須求清楚，責任須求明瞭，當由菲士廷將軍立據一紙，以資負責，如我方提訊時，英方可負責交出，本人經此會商後，業已致電張主任請示云。」</p>
<p>據廿七日工商日報譯載德臣西報廿六日以「半島酒店的騷動」爲題，刋出關於余氏被捕的經過稱：</p>
<p>「余氏近以私事在港，據通常可靠之報告稱：渠確已被中國憲兵於星期一日下午拘捕，但渠設法逃脫而受香港警察保護，聞渠會說服其拘捕者，隨同彼返平島酒店，俾其取回一些衣物，余氏至此遂以電　警察。」</p>
<p>「企圖拘捕余兆祺之事，爲普通人所發現之最初　兆，厥爲當一武裝中國憲兵於星期一日晚，進入半島酒店之軍官俱樂部，井就入門內之　坐下。余氏鋻於一武裝中國憲兵抵步，乃返至其四樓之房間，一空軍警察乃派至守衛，當晚有兩人在余氏之房間，與余渡過了宵，同時另有一人則在門外之走廊看守。」</p>
<h3>余擅長英語　謂「有功英國」獲勳</h3>
<p>余兆祺到底是怎樣的一個人呢？當目的報上曾有記載，謂「余生長於香港，日軍進攻香港時，曾　英方作反第五縱隊和奸細的工作，爲　極大。」緬甸之役，所以有功於英國，獲勳章。其他名報，茲略有記載，但以廿八日的新生晚報，最爲詳實，該報井指出余氏曾對屏山機塲事件發表贊同英方鳩築的意見。又證實余氏井非香港的土生。余氏之要年初已赴英留學等。據其全文稱：</p>
<p>「余氏年四十許，身軀壯碩，衣履整齊在港常御軍服，襟章煌然。唇上留小　，修整光潔，若有威儀，言談豪邁，尤擅長英語。所以與歐西人十交談整治，情感交融，而渠不拘細節，亦不爲俗見所　，尤足稱爲渠之特點。」</p>
<p>「今春，屏山機塲問題，正爲中外所注目，湯鼎沸騰。而余氏一度曾在華僑日報發表談話，對此舉則甚表贊同，認爲有利於中英兩國頗大，本市公共集會，亦多爲記者所述及之人物。」</p>
<p>「余氏稅居半島酒店四樓，其妻於年初赴英留學，渠則常至軍官俱樂部遊憇，所交者亦多英軍顯要。」……</p>
<h3>事態的發展　有關我軍法與主權</h3>
<p>因爲余氏與陳策將軍曾有那段關係，記者特探詢於陳將軍的留港友好。據稱：余氏當時僅任陳將軍的通譯。余氏返國後，陳將軍察覺其「行爲可疑」，曾通知粵省當局扣留余氏於曲江。自此以後，陳將軍與余的關係，即告斷絕。</p>
<p>自余兆祺事件發生後，港中華文報紙，除奸逆岑維休所辦的華僑日報外，俱以顯蓄篇幅刋載有關消息，但迄未有著論批評者，報「鳥瞰欄」，廿七日却說：「事情有來則有往。我想，假如英國憲兵在中國設立總部（原文加S表示複數—記者按）到處抓人，又將有什麼反響。」如此「幽默」，祇有該報才說得出！據國民日報廿八日載稱：「余兆祺昨日雖離半島酒店來港一小時，仍有英軍負責看管。我方以英方已立據負責看管余氏，故已將監視余氏之我憲兵撤去。」</p>
<p>直至記者屬稿的現在，本港陸軍當局對此事件尙未發表任何聲明。事處發展如何，一時尙難判明。總之，我國的軍法和主權在香港，又遭遇一個試煉了！</p>

<h3>烈日下</h3>
<p>— 張白懷</p>
<p>我是着得出他們滿而戰門的風度的。正如我自己和其他的年青的朋友，在勝利的艱途上，跋涉了一個年頭又一個年頭。當偶然的機會，使我們相對在街上緊緊的揚，而是時無法表達內心的感情的時候，我們是否就祇是微笑着，或者竟然就這樣沉默地各自走開了呢？</p>
<p>用冷眼來躲避却是常有的。一個朋友從遙遠的後方寫信來說，他對人們的面孔看得更清楚了，有一次他在電影院的門口看見一們同學。他也分明地看見了，但是爲了自己前些時有信給他沒有得到回覆，和他那副驕傲的樣子，使他不敢和他招呼一句……。</p>
<p>而我和現在的這兩個朋友，終於邂遇着別後的第一次相見了。我知道他們做着的一種非常危險的工作，而我却用細想建築着彌漫空茫的事業。羨慕着別人，懷疑着自己，在過去的日子中間，想到這個問題，我曾經　愧而又苦痛。</p>
<p>「呵，想不到今天在這裏碰到，我們正在打聽着你呵！」他說。在他們那些緊張流漫的生活裏也沒有忘記我，我眞的有點却們怨恨自己不能首先說出這一句話了。—希望明白朋友的近况，不願探求朋友的地址；明白朋友的近况可以安心，知道朋友的地址却要寫信；哦，寫信，我用什麼去告訴他們呀！</p>
<p>但我無論如何，也是歡迎他們，高興我們有一次快樂的聚會的。</p>
<p>猛烈的太陽在我們頭上。友情的歡笑是華麗的傘子；在這四面環山的谷道上，我們好像划着一條船，汗滴是槁　楊起的點點的水珠。</p>
<p>路邊，一只花白的蝴蝶陪着我們趕路，飛過一　又是一　，這精致可憐的小動物，牠竟和我們賽跑嗎？</p>
<p>他們有說不完的故事：江南的夏夜，風雪的景　，恐怖和勇敢的交織，生命與死亡的肉博。在一條深廣沸熱的血河裏，我看見他們泅過來了。</p>
<p>如果，我能夠自由地運用自己的筆，我將寫出許多動人的故事，因爲不能，所以我更願意來告訴你呵！朋友顯然在高估我的能力了。</p>
<p>但我即使不能，我也非常願意聽到。我已經浪費過不少的紙張和時間，今後我自然還不能自暴自棄地拋棄了自己的筆。</p>
<p>「說吧，我希望能夠把它寫出來。</p>
<p>這是使他們爲難的。從那說起呢？如此許多生活的血淚，一時間要說出其中的某一片斷，是一件困難的事。</p>
<p>然而思索了一下之後，走在左邊的朋友說了：</p>
<p>「那時我們是在敵人的包圍裏，我們的爆破組奉着命令，要留在敵人後方，隨時找機會紛敵人一個打擊。</p>
<p>「這是個占城，它的淪陷是無聲而息地，太陽旗在城頭落下悲慘的暗影，維持會就宣告成立了。</p>
<p>「起初敵人還想利用我們原有的鄉鎭商會長來串演牠的醜劇，但是搜遍了山塢和竹林，到後來仍然不得不打斷這個愚昧的夢想。王亞明，這敵人　養的走狗，僞軍的特務隊長，就被擁上黑色的舞台，作爲一幕小醜劇的主角了。</p>
<p>「我們知道王亞明這個名字，他過去一切我們也是明白的。在他被敵人俘虜過去以前，他曾經是一個機　勇敢的爆破人員。長長的個子，精明而能幹，後來。他就吸上鴉片了，才不過是二十五歲左右。</p>
<p>「他不能算是完全沒有良心的人，從他手裏釋放我們的工作人員，就有十幾個。他並且公開的說：我要給鬼子一個打擊，　是容易的事呵！</p>
<p>「那次正是我自己去和王亞明說的，爲要達成一個任務我們常常要　這種危險。」</p>
<p>「本來我們是要他出城來的，他的客却要我們派一個人去。……見到了王亞明的時候，……我自然是扮成了商人模樣前去的……我請他把守衛　退，說明了來意。突然的，我就看見他的臉色變了：「你不必多說！」他這樣子，我知道是裝出來的，他自然不至於立刻反正，却決不會把我殺害。我用冷嘲的態度說道：後悔是來不及的呢！</p>
<p>「他又無言地深思了一陣，意外的他站起身來，　我到他的房間裏去。</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？不要使我在這兒　　得太久了吧。我說。</p>
<p>「但是他却變得非常客氣了，最好的香烟糖葉拿出來說：我們得着機會商量一個秘密的法子。</p>
<p>「這時我很安心，覺得我的工作已有成功的希望。這個淳樸的古城雖然是無聲無息地淪陷，但是作爲敵人的據點却是重要的。城裏的敵人有至百以上，還有在訓的新兵五六百，倘使計劃能夠成功，就是說，把敵人的倉庫炸掉了，這戰鬥的收獲不能算少。</p>
<p>「這個城離鐵路綫有七八十裏，通常敵人的供應品由火車運來，再由汽車載到離城十五裏的小　上，然後再由城裏的敵人派挑　馬匹去接運，差不多一星期就有一次，每次這條路上却戒備很很嚴密。那些裝載火藥的木箱子一律是黃色的，我們就想從這些黃色的木箱子上想法子，如果我們能夠在這樣一只箱子裏裝載定時炸彈，把牠混進敵人和倉庫，那就成功了。</p>
<p>「這樣，我就給王亞明說，機會不能再失，這二天之內敵人的供應一定又到，敵人的軍隊正電　向前進展，　蕩我們山地的野戰軍。王亞明幾經考慮，就答應下來，約定一個送定時炸彈的時間。</p>
<p>「當我正預備走的時候，忽然來了一個情報，說城裏有一個中國兵進來了。我的心頗有點慌，敵人的情報竟是這樣厲害。後來還是王亞明給我想辦法，他給我穿上一套僞軍的衣服，陪着我走出了城門。</p>
<p>「我回來以後，就進行工作，我們預備在敵倉庫爆炸的同時，更在操塲上埋下地雷，以炸　敵人的新兵，另一方面呢，我們還聯絡了小部份友軍，在黎明時炸彈的一響　佯作攻擊，如果王亞明承時反正，計劃就完全成功了。</p>
<p>「王亞明頃見可恨！這傢伙竟祇是口頭上答應了我們。地雷爆炸死傷了三十幾個敵人，而倉庫裏刦始終沒有聲音。唉，我想，做了漢奸，如果他還得意，是不可能和他的主子反抗的！」</p>
<p>說到這裏，我的朋友停止了。太陽仍是那種猛烈，使汗珠注滿了雙頰，抬起頭張不開眼睛，夏天走路，　應該載一頂寬圓的草帽呢。</p>
<p>「這個故事完了嗎？」我感到不能滿尼。</p>
<p>「完是完了，」朋友說：「漢奸的下塲總是一樣的。在這事情後不久，王亞明就給我們打死了。王亞明的有一個漂亮的妹子和鬼子的宣撫隊長軋着姘頭，宣撫隊長是一個昏　的酒色之徒，他的妹妹是妖孽的種子，某一夜，這一對寶貝被我們另一組的同志活提過來了。……關於那個妹子，或者由他來講吧。」</p>
<p>用更傳奇式的故事縮短着路，我們看見一個由頭上的塔尖了，太陽的光輝在淡下去，有一點輕輕的涼風。我愉快的地看看我兩個朋友，在他們滿撲風　的臉上，已經加印了今天的烈日所塗上一層發紅的顏色。</p>
<h3>克諦　生之禮讚</h3>
<p>靠近海邊的個破落的村莊裏，依漁爲生的兩口之家，丈夫爲了妻子今天生下了第一個孩子，停止了一天捕魚的生涯，靠着他底茁壯的身軀，和一雙黑而粗大的手操勞着，代替了妻子做着忙無頭緒的家務：淘米，劈柴，煮飯，洗孩子的尿布，又照料着妻子的飲食的茶水……</p>
<p>孩子保持了父親的傳統，旣黑且大，一雙手雖然小，然而又壯健又圓滑，常他呱呱墜地的時候，也原始地哭了幾聲，而且哭聲來得特別響亮，沉重，伴和着海浪的呌嘯，交奏着生之序曲。</p>
<p>孩子生下來三天以後，沒有應得的休息和調養，妻子爬下了床，雖然精神感覺到有點衰弱，底臉上流露着安慰的表情，丈夫的臉上也隨時泛起得意的笑容，因爲他們底香火得以傳績下去，他們底純樸和本能的愛情更加深厚起來。</p>
<p>六月的陽光，在海面抹上一片金黃色，飛濺的浪花，衝擊着岩岸，丈夫寫著一葉古銅色的小舟在海面撤下了他底希望之綱，妻子却坐在屋簷下的蔭處結補着破靜地睡着，緋紅的雙頰，徵動的嘴唇，圓胖的臉，相映於碧海藍天和金黃的陽光之下，構成了一幅美麗動人的生之圓畫。</p>
<p>當丈夫背着一袋勞力所得的代　——新鮮而跳動的魚踏上歸途的時候，妻子在遙遠的門口便看清了，正要立起身子，孩子醒了，哇哇地又哭了起來，她祇得把他抱起，緊靠著她自己的胸脯，向前走去迎接着疲勞的丈夫。雖然她不能帮着丈夫，像平常一樣地代他背着沉重的裝潢了魚的麻布袋，然而，當她挨近了丈夫的身邊丈夫却在流着汗珠的臉上露出了笑容，並且做著鬼臉逗着無知的孩子笑了，放下了魚袋，熱狂地把他從妻子的懷抱裏接了過來，高高地興趣在半空中，這時候，陽光晒滿了孩子底臉，海浪正被大風激蕩着，後面的一陣浪頭掀着雪白的飛花，撲過前碳一陣浪頭，襯托着背後的清碧一色的圓天，象徵着新生命開端！</p>
<p>然而，人世的風浪，畢竟勝過大海的狂濤，憂患的魔手常常折磨着生命的歡欣，他們底平靜的生活被無情的不測風雲而攪亂了；突然海面捲起了一陣狂風，暴風雨激蕩着海浪，怒吼狂嘯，岩岸終於敵不住萬丈高潮的衝擊而被潰決了，海水於是像猛獸一般向岸上奔來，他們的茅屋被大水沖走了，破舊的漁船，漁綱和所有的傢具也都作無聲的水葬。</p>
<p>丈夫背着兩條薄薄的棉被包袱，抱着睡熱了的孩子，妻子携着隨身應用的衣物，雙雙地開始走了的流亡征途，他們逃向數千裏外的一個陌生的村莊，重建起溫暖的家！</p>
<p>他們冒着風霜和亂餓，終於到達了一個距離大海五十餘裏外的村莊，投向他們僅有的一家親戚——要底娘家，她底父親早年死去了，現在只　下一個老的娘，雖然還有幾十畝田產，但因爲膝下無兒，祇好讓它白白地荒無，於是這一對年青力壯的夫婦們便承繼了這一份田產，從此拋棄了捕漁生涯，自己耕種着荒蕪了多年的田地，倒也能自給自足，安居樂業。在他們純樸的心裏，會自然地發掘出一條眞理，因爲他們深信着：天無絕人之路。</p>
<p>孩子在一串茫然的幾月中長大了起來，是那樣酷像着他底父親，有同樣健壯的聲容和身軀，在他週歲以後他的爸爸爲他取名「海根」，表示這條小生命是由海邊而生的，同時他們依然常常憧憬着海邊的生活是那樣的難苦，海上的風浪又時常的折磨着他們，但終於不能抹殺他們底純樸而又堅固的愛戀之情，而且一代一代地傳了下去，直到永永遠遠。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（七二）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>爲了要明白墨太太空間是怎樣一種具心，麗華這次鼓着勇氣，突破了歷來緘默的　習，向墨太太質問了。</p>
<p>『媽，我還要唱多久，就不再唱了？』</p>
<p>『小華，你問這是什麼意思？』墨太太有些不懂麗華的意思，她瞪着眼說。</p>
<p>『我是說，我要唱到什麼時候，就可以不唱了呢？』麗華加以解釋地又問一遍</p>
<p>『噢，我的乖！還早着哩！』墨太太笑着拉了麗華的手說。『你才三歲，才剛剛露一點頭角；要唱到像梅蘭芳那樣紅；要唱到咱娘兒倆不愁穿了；那時候你就可以不唱了。』</p>
<p>『麗華在心裏琢磨着：「要唱到像梅蘭芳那樣紅；」「要唱到不愁吃穿了」；像梅蘭芳那樣紅，她簡直覺得是夢想。據她所知道，直到如今，同行裏也還沒有一個人能有這種希望。比她好的；比她歲數大的；還不作如是想，她敢嗎？即如她唱一輩子，怕也是辦不到的。至於唱到不愁吃愁穿，這却容易！但值得揣摩的，是墨太太的所謂「不愁吃愁穿」是怎樣一個尺度？要手裏有多少錢？才能夠不愁吃愁穿？這就要看墨太太的「吃」「穿」標準有多麼高？多麼大？她記得墨太太從前常說：「唱吧，唱紅了，將來有了錢，可以吃好的，穿好的」她對於墨太太的這個「好」的程度，幾乎是摸不着邊沿的茫然！她自忖，就是她唱出一個錢山來，墨太太也還是覺得不夠的。况且要唱出一個「錢山」來，又是談何容易的事？即如再唱十年，二十年，恐怕也沒有用。石玉樓不足已經唱了三十年嗎？不是還沒有唱出倜錢山，就已經倒下來了嗎？想到這兩件事都不是她輕易作到的，而墨太太又一定要她作到，她感到她完了！她覺得她毫無獲救的希望了，於是她頹喪地垂下頭去。</p>
<p>『小華，唱戲好哇！瞧瞧你現在吧，就有許多人捧你！送給你東西；請你吃飯；趕明兒更紅起來，還要神氣哩！好好地唱，唱戲比幹什麼都有用出息。』墨太太用說敎的口吻，誘導着麗華。『可是，愈沒看見石叔叔嗎？石叔叔就是爲了唱戲弄成這個樣子的』麗華兀地仰起了頭，不服地辦駁着。</p>
<p>『那是因爲他唱的不好了，人家瞧不起他，所以他氣瘋了！』墨太太毫不以爲然地說。</p>
<p>『如果我也唱的不好了，我也瘋了！怎麼辦？』</p>
<p>『不會的，你絕不會的，小華』！墨太太堅信地說『你還小的很，前途正遠大着哩！快不要胡思亂想。』</p>
<p>『不，我要老的，要像石叔叔一樣地倒下來的！所以，我想趁早不唱了，免得將來呌人家瞧不起。』麗華沉著地說。</p>

<h3>母敎錄</h3>
<p>— 老葉</p>
<p>—美麗的黑暗—</p>
<p>我小時膽很小，有一天我又告訴母親，說我怕黑暗。她說，『孩子，你不懂得黑暗的美處。』</p>
<p>那天晚上，我見她熄了燈，獨自坐在黑暗中。她說，『你要來就來，我不免強你。不過，你在黑暗裏坐定，一看清楚時，你可以看到許多白天亮光裏看不到的東西呢。』我在她身邊坐下，她指給我看，看房間內的東西都改了樣，許多看得熱膩的東西，此時都顯得很新奇。床看上去，祇不過是一處供人安臥的塲合，白天看到的花　，此時已看不見。椅子種種不同的形式，此時都分別不出來，房內一切的東西都顯得特別寗靜，特別親切。</p>
<p>第二天晚上，黑暗中我和母親坐在窗口，靜聽遠處禮拜堂中傳來的　聲，看庭中的老樹開着白花，在朦朧的星光下，像白雪般素潔。從那天起，後來每到夜晚，我常隨着母親，熄了屋內的燈，去領略那黑暗中寗靜的美。有一次在黑暗中坐着時，母親說，『別亂害怕。認清你怕的東西，你就不會再怕了。』</p>
<p>過了多年，我已成了家，有一次我在經濟上受了大的打擊和家人坐在一塊，討論應付的方法。我們又熄了燈。坐在黑暗中。因爲我們每逢要靜心聽音樂，或專心討論甚麼問題時，常常總是把燈熄去。但那次在黑暗中，我忽然憶起母親的話來，我們原先都祇感到畏縮，但這一來我立刻覺悟：我們應當沉着的去應付。</p>
<p>結果我們克服了一切的困難，同時在家人團結奮鬥中，反體味到不少人生償的樂趣。</p>
<p>兒時母親因我怕黑暗，給我的敎導，想不到在多年後，竟助我渡過危險的難關，它不僅添了我的勇氣，更令我滯著一種「欣賞人生」的態度，去解決了許多生活中的困難問題。</p>
<h3>口吃與左手性</h3>
<p>— 乃藩</p>
<p>口吃似乎是一種流行的病態，雖然並不威脅人們的健康，但總給人以不方便，尤其在交際塲中，口吃是頗失體面的事。患口吃的人，不能做政治家，不能做律師，也不能當敎員，總之，一個口吃患者，在許多塲合，都會吃很大虧的。</p>
<p>但是，患口吃的原因是什麼呢？有沒有治療的方法呢？這是大家關心的問題。</p>
<p>據心理學家的研究，口吃和左手性有關。</p>
<p>什麼是左手性，也先得加以解釋。原來一般人的工作，都是以右手爲主的，右手的力量旣大，右手的運用也較靈活。心理學家查出這種曆手爲主的特性，並不是由於學習，而是由於先天的賦予。所以，百分之九十七八的人是屬於右手性的，但也有百分之二三却是例外，那是左手性。</p>
<p>左性是遺傳的，無論執筆，熱筷，拍球，……，在左手性的人，都以使用左手爲方便，這種左手性的人，雖然較少，但也像口吃一樣的，時常可以發現。</p>
<p>但是因爲一般人都是以右手爲主，所以一個左手性的兒童，往往被家長或敎師忽視其特性，在他學習執筆，熱筷……的時候，認爲是他模仿的錯誤，所以在矯正或至懲罰的情形下，迫使左手性的兒童，也用右手工作，兒童是無知的，當然祇得跟着做。可是因此造成了口吃。</p>
<p>據心理學家的研究，語言的神經和主使手的動作的神經在腦中的部位是毗鄰的，所以當左手性的兒童受到強迫而使用右手時，語言的神經因爲毗鄰而給擾亂，於是發言就不能圓滑的吐出，而成爲口吃。</p>
<p>所以家長們和敎師們對於有左手性的遺傳的兒童應特別加以注意，不必強其應用右手，否則，兒童在成人時便有患口吃的可能。</p>

<h3>未來的理想家庭</h3>
<p>— 佐溪譯</p>
<p>在洛杉機威爾夏林蔭路的隅，點綴着一座新穎別緻的房屋，配着美麗的美國杉木牆壁，閃閃發光的，鋁質屋頂。屋內共有房間五間，裏面的陳設佈置，盡是別出心裁的裝修和傢具。洛杉機建築師彭斯特地建造此屋作爲一種試騐品的。屋子裏面有電子吸灰機，室內交通系統，遠處操縱的擴音器五隻，電機　紐十餘只，裝有霓虹燈的廁所，殺菌的電燈，吸收聲音的天花板，電器牙刷等。這種電氣牙刷用橡製造，刷牙時藉電力振璗而動作，可以省却擦刷的麻煩。</p>
<p>自從該屋於三月聞開放以來，前往的人絡譯不絕，對於這種摩登建築咸稱奇不置。建築師的目的想從公衆的批評來決定新家庭的陳設究竟那些最配合一般人的胃口。</p>
<p>這座房屋是假定供給夫婦及子女二人四口之家居住的。全部房屋作U字形，包圍天井的周圍，內有臥室三間，浴室兩間，客房一間，起居室一間，飯廳一間，廚房一間，工塲一間，汽車間一間，全部房間裝有空氣調節器，所以是冬暖夏涼的。</p>
<p>彭斯建造這座房屋足足化了美金七萬五千元。雖則是因爲內部陳設太華貴的緣故，終究解決不了家庭建築的基本問題，即技衛精巧而成本低廉。不過將來這個問題解決以以後，我們不是就可以享受這種又舒適又華中的迷人的寓所了嗎？</p>
<p>彭斯式房屋裏的廚房，不管是一間寬大的高度機械化的家庭工廠，裏面裝置科學燈光，人造通風器和聲音吸收器，和各種用以簡化烹飪和家事的手續，全部機器共種二千磅。在牆壁的一面装著一隻有四个龙头的爐气爐予，旁边有碗树和椻　，供调製食物之用。在大幅玻璃窗的前面，装置著处理垃圾的机关和水力洗碗器，其次是一只抽屉四只，分别貯藏著不同的食物。玻璃窗的对面是全副设備的洗衣處，有洗衣器，乾衣器和熨斗。此外還有一架　衣機。</p>
<p>廚房的中央是全　房屋的神經中樞，是一種室內交通系統的核心，從這裏可以和各房間通話，從這裏可　雷力控制開閉各處的電燈和收音機，啓閉門戶，並開放草地洒水器。</p>

<h3>苦悶篇（四）</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>出版者的苦悶</p>
<p>這裏所說的出版者，當然不是那些有背景，受津貼的，而是說的資本獨立，經營自出的。前者出版其名，宣傳其實，他根本不能列之於文化界。他沒有一般出版者的苦悶，他的苦悶是出版以外的失敗。只有後者，才是眞正的出版者，而現在他們也正處於極度的苦悶之中。</p>
<p>先說資本。他的資本是股東的，或者是他個別成本是這樣的貴，他的生意毫無賺錢的把握。不論什麼好稿子，不論他所　用的編者如何說項，他不能不顧着他整個事業的生存與否而謹愼將事，而只好收取一些最可以賺錢的稿子。他要作正當的提倡，以致危及事業的生存，他不會這樣　！他的信條是：最好不收稿子，而將資金運用於其他賺錢的道途上；收了稿子最好不付　，因爲稿費空間比　工便宜；排了不印，因爲由組印了字，反而賣不出去，不像白紙隨時可以變現款；印了也不賣，因爲市面天天在漲價，賣出去不夠本，還不如等漲足了，或者市面安定了再賣出去，賣下來的錢比較可以有一些實用。他願意以他所能　用的資本，於賺錢之外，作一些文化事業，但環境不允許，也只好無可奈何地聽之。</p>
<p>次說背景。他沒有背景。他辦不好，他已苦悶；他辦得好，還是免不了苦悶。爲什麼呢？往往有人要使他有背景，要利用他的無背景。</p>
<p>他自然也想求出路。他想改行，但也和編者一樣，他幹慣了這一行，改不來。如果是一個較大的書局，規模大，用人多，連關門收店都不容易，身爲主持人的出版者，那才眞正苦悶透頂呢！</p>
<p>他將怨什麼怪什麼呢？他只好怨導環境！</p>

<h3>一傻事</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>走出家門，馬路旁邊一個紅色水龍頭不斷地流着水，如碗口大小，旁邊有人力車夫小工之類的人物，在利用這免費的自來水洗手脚及其它，我停住了脚，看出那是水龍頭蓋大槪被人偷去了，以致水便自由自在地向馬路上流。</p>
<p>這樣日以繼夜地流，未免太可惜了，我應該報告自來水公司。心頭忖彙着。</p>
<p>很酷烈的陽光，同時也有件緊急事，但我仍跑到一個公用電話處，花了三百塊錢電話費，對上海自來水公司報告這件事。電話中的對話如下：</p>
<p>〔我〕喂！自來水公司嗎？</p>
<p>〔公司〕嗯！有什麼事？</p>
<p>〔我〕黃渡路上有一隻自來水龍頭壞了，水一直向外流，你們趕快派人去修理一下。</p>
<p>〔公司〕啥個自來水龍頭？</p>
<p>〔我〕就是在馬路旁邊的那個紅色的在龍頭。</p>
<p>〔公司〕在什麼地方？</p>
<p>〔我〕北四川路底黃渡路，從前呌黃陸路。</p>
<p>〔公司〕你是什麼地方，警察局嗎？</p>
<p>〔我〕不，我是住在附近的。</p>
<p>〔公司〕噢！曉得了。</p>
<p>兩天以後，直到我寫這文的現在，那隻水龍頭還是沒有蓋，已經白白地流了兩晝夜水，現在還在流。</p>
<p>上海自來水公司大槪不希罕這點漏　的，我想，吹　一池春水，我做了一個傻瓜了嗎！</p>
<h3>猛虎！</h3>
<p>— 張民富</p>
<p>夕陽斜下，在那茅屋檐下的陰影裏，遮蔽着許多赤背跣足的農夫。</p>
<p>「唉！這算一個什麼年頭兒！運年不收，又鬧起什麼瘟疫來了。」劉老頭兒從嘴邊拿開他的烟袋，憂鬱沉悶地說。</p>
<p>「眞是！這幾天來，着實鬧得不像樣子了！當年壯力的小夥子，一連死了十幾個；現在反倒更厲害起來。德運婊子昨天方　抬出去，德運哥和他的兒娘又在鬧個不休——哼，可怕！……」剃着光頭的趙老二，悽愴地搖了搖了頭。當他說到末一句時，好像有所忌憚似的，把那最後的半句話又嚥回去了。</p>
<p>劉老頭仰視着天空，似在憂鬱地想。在坐的每一個人的面上，都顯出恐慌的神情。</p>
<p>許久的沉悶，忽被一位赤着背的青年面破了；他詫異地說：「眞也奇怪；人人都說，如果大家假扮過年的模樣，就算度過這個不幸的年頭兒，瘟神也便收回他的法力，回天復命去了。可是近來好多人來，粘吊旗兒的粘吊旗兒，貼門對兒的貼門對兒；怎麼還沒一點效騐呢？」</p>
<p>「咳！　兒了。」劉老頭兒一邊說着一邊嘆了一口氣。「往年沈老先生的針法如神，凡有得這種的，把他老人家請來一針就好。還有胡一爺的聖水，也像仙丹一樣；病人喝了無不立見奇效的。如今就大大地不同：老年哥，德運　，……針也打了，聖水也喝了，聽說還到廟裏許了一道經願；可是都未見效！」</p>
<p>「難道得病就死，沒有一點兒救星嗎？」幾個人失望地問。</p>
<p>「救星倒有。」劉老頭兒點着烟袋繼續又說：「那不是從城裏同來的李四先生說嗎：按現在的年頭兒，非得洋大夫　這種病不可，他們說病名呌「花拉拉，」打洋針，吃洋藥，便會好的。」</p>
<p>「那麼爲什麼不請一位洋大未來治呢？愈瞧左一個右一個死得多怕人哪！」</p>
<p>「　！……」老者撤了撇嘴，帶着輕蔑的神氣。「洋大夫？那除非給有錢的老爺們預備的！治一次要花十幾萬錢；我們這些莊穆腦袋也治得起嗎？恐怕賣掉祖墳，也不夠治兩次的吧？」</p>
<p>衆人瞠目相視，那位赤着背的青年不禁吐了舌頭。</p>
<p>他們知道別無蕃策，祇得自求安慰地說：「遭劫在數，在數難逃；怕死是不行的，那麼聽天由命吧！」</p>
<p>「，……」</p>
<p>幕地，遠遠傳來似哭的聲音：「巧兒他爺呀！……」衆人的視綫，幾都葉在越來越近的一位老驅的面上；尤其是正在吸煙的劉老頭兒，把眼瞪得更大；因爲他已知道戰兢失措的來者，正是他的老婆。</p>
<p>「怎麼的，怎麼的？」他驚慌地問。</p>
<p>「可了不得啦！……巧兒的……爺……也……在……吐……瀉……」說到末句便哽咽起來。</p>
<p>劉老頭兒的嘴唇立變蒼白，多紋的臉皮，也在痙變；嘴裏的烟袋，不自覺地落在地上。從他那急喘的聲息裏，好像痛切地呼着：「可怕的『花拉拉』呀！」隨即，身子像癱了似的伏下去了。</p>
<p>年青年農人們，攙扶着混身顫抖的劉老頭兒在他們的後面，跟着一們哽咽的老嫗。</p>
<p>茅屋簷下的陰影裏，除了幾條瓜尾巴上的　子嗡嗡地飛着，一切都是非常靜寂。</p>
<p>翌日早晨，劉老頭兒家的門上，高高插着一簇紙錢；徵風吹動，發出颯颯之聲。門前站着幾位老婦人，有的撩起衣襟拭揩着裏傳出一陣陣悲痛的婦人哭聲；「姓劉的——你不　我們孩子大人了……」雖然已是喊啞了的喉音，可是她的痛切　哭並沒因之稍息。</p>
<p>數日以來，　莊上的空氣，更加緊張起來。穿着白孝衣的小孩們在街上亂跑，一陣一陣的哭聲，到處可以聽見。</p>
<p>最近，據村中最高的行政會議，議決在數日之內念一棚道士經。夜間在街頭洒布聖水，據稅可以殲滅那些散瘟的鬼神。</p>
<h3>長安夏景</h3>
<p>— 東揚</p>
<p>西安近來是越變得熱鬧了。每日有無數的旅客，從這邊過去，也有不少的客人，在這短時間地停留下來；要回北平去的，多由這裏坐陝省路局的汽車到韓城，去山西，經正太路返北平，或仍舊上東去的火車到上海由海道回北平。</p>
<p>西安近來氣候是很熱。這已和往年大不一樣，其熱度和此時的上海漢口都差不多。冰淇淋早已上市五百元一杯，每日下午出來逛馬路的，也更多了。在東大街，南院門幾個熱門的市區間，眞是熱鬧得很，花旗袍目前似乎已成爲女人最喜愛的時裝，鄉下女人們不管合適不合適，也都爭着穿。電影一共有三家，每日四塲，幾乎塲塲客滿，可是不買票的看客，也不少。因之，電影塲的老闆近來也不斷叫苦。</p>
<p>路上汽車也多了。吉普·美國四輪大卡車，經常在疾馳着；但開得太快了，也常出事。自東門至西門近來也有公共片車，全程售票二百元，尙稱便宜。如鐘樓下車則只一百元。惟只有四輛車在開駛着，且常拋錨，每次車上均擁濟不堪。最近也有人倡議修鋪柏油路，但未見有具體辦法。</p>
<p>復員的　溴給西安帶來了一個大學—國立西北大學，一個獨立學院，以及國立西北工學院。這兩校的大部員生，近來都已自城固來西安。學校的儀器，圖書也正在手搬運。西大的校址是在西門外前東北大學舊址，校長爲劉季洪氏。西工院址在早慈巷舊一中內，院長爲潘承孝氏，惟該院院址不夠，近由資　委員會將咸陽已停辦之酒精廠廠址發給該院借用。該院最近即可前往接收，將來仍分沒兩院。第一院在西安，第二院在咸陽。</p>
<p>西安的生活費用也很高。麵粉已賣到一萬一千餘元一袋，米四千五百元一斗，鷄蛋一百元兩個，理髮帶擦油連電吹一千四百元一位，六月份公敎人員待遇雖已調整，惟西北區增加甚徵。公敎人員均叫苦連天。日前司法界（陝西高等法院·長安地方法院）及敎育界（西大·西工及近即將遷來西安之西北醫學院）也相繼電諸行政院對公敎人員待遇另行合理調整。</p>
<h3>德國少年　思想測騐</h3>
<p>— 鄧蹊譯</p>
<p>在法國岡別業地方的一個嬰兒戰俘營裏，七千多個十二歲至十七歲的德國少年俘虜，在法國軍官的指導管理下，受着民主思想的薰陶。今年的四月，營裏絡續舉行了兩次非正式的民主思想測騐，問題一共有二百多個。</p>
<p>其中有一個問題是：「希特勒是瘋狂的罪人嗎？結果統計下來二千九百六十人答是的，二千九百五十一人答非，而其餘的九百八十一人則猶豫不決。</p>
<p>又一題謂：「納粹黨的小卒要否對德國失敗負其責任？」結果二千五百七十五人答「要負的」，二千三百人答「要不負的」，二千三百人答「不要負的」，而對於「現在聯合國擒着的納粹領袖設若現在叫他們一一吊死可以嗎？」這個問題，七千人中三千一百七十人說「可以的」，二千九百二十三人說不可以的。</p>
<p>而他們對於這次他們國家打敗了是不是應該的而且罪惡的？這問題，四千三百四十七人說是應該的。而且他們這次失敗也是最罪惡不過的。又他們對於混血兒的思想「我決不和猶太女子結婚因爲她會降底我以及我子孫的身價」，這一課題祇有五百十四人認爲對的，而六千零五十六人則認爲無稽之談。</p>
<p>這一連串的問答，是很值得研究的，反猶運動原是納粹用作鼓吹戰爭的幌子，但國青年却並未深中其毒。至於在測騐作答時，他們是否故意計好，那就不得而知了。</p>

<h3>腦子的秘密</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>天才的腦垂腺特別發達</p>
<p>天才人物的腦子，到底有甚麼特徵呢？這是一個科學家們不斷探究的謎。天才腦子的秘密，不在於腦子本身的大小，在於養育腦子血管的大小。</p>
<p>腦膜內有動脈血管和靜脈血管，它們的大小和構造，與腦力的強弱有絕對的關係；至於腦子本身的大小，重量及構造，却是無關重要的。</p>
<p>遠在一九二六年，海志博士就開始有系統地研究，天才和平當人的腦備管及腦血管及腦膜炎。他發現，天才人物的腦血管，特別豐富，特別椱雜。</p>
<p>天才腦子的構造，大小，及重量，和平常人的腦子，並沒有多大區別。眞正的區別，是卓越的腦膜，血管特多；庸人的腦子，血管細小緊縮。</p>
<p>腦子並不是「孤立派」，它不免要受到其他器官的刺激。腦子與人體的腺，有密切的關係。</p>
<p>精神分裂患者，就是一個　好的例子，起由腦垂體和腎上腺的不調和，腎上腺所分泌的物質，好像點然人類思想火燄的　氣，沒有它，就產生不出光亮。</p>
<p>甲狀腺的混亂，直接影響到頭腦。思想遲鈍，和性腺及甲狀腺呆遲有密切關係。</p>
<p>天才的腦垂腺特別發達，性腺及甲狀腺的活動，都達到最高峯。</p>
<p>腎上腺和腦垂腺也是痛　相關。如果腎上腺是健康的，腦垂腺也必然健康，腦子也健康。如果一種腺有衰頹現象，腦子的動活也立刻不靈光了。</p>
<p>天才腦子的秘密，直到現在才正確地揭露了，過去的種種理論，都是不政確的。</p>
<h3>猶豫</h3>
<p>— 衣谷</p>
<p>我有一位伯父，由於業務上的關係，認識了一家火榮廠的經理。這家火柴廠便　是眞茹撞車更卡車上貨物的主人。那位經理也就是車上的押貨者。在撞車時，他被拋出了幾文以外：因此雖然身上是受了傷。却僥倖沒有遭難，而在車上的人，倒因無法逃避而慘遭焚斃了。</p>
<p>出險後，據他談起那時的情形說：「此事發生在很早的清晨，大地劇露一線曙光，但是撞車的原因却未必一定是由於視綫不明：最大的原因恐怕還是內爲卡車司機的猶豫不決，不能當機立斷；因爲雖然天色　靈，但是遠地開來的長列火車，無論在形在聲上，至少星隱約可辦的。當時他若是立即停車，靜候快車過去，那麼這慘劇也根本不會發生的了；就是即使開足速率，冒一次險，那也未始沒有斷過鐵道的希望。壞就壞在想過去而又不敢，不過去却又會立即煞車。錯過了最實貴的一刹那，再想衝過去時，便因火車已到而致發生了互撞的慘劇。」</p>
<p>綜觀以上的事實，可知無論做什麼事，往往失敗於缺乏勇氣和毅力，以致坐失了良機。而處世敎育上更告訴我們成功的秘訣，最重要的便是當機立斷，因爲猶豫不決是成功的最大敵人。</p>
<p>世界偉人們處車的方針便是先冷靜地觀察考慮事情的利害，再加以決定。一經決定以後，便絕無反顧之餘地，則使不幸而遭失敗，也絕不因之而頹喪，或懊悔決策的失當，只有立即設法另貢途徑加以補救。當而臨成敗危機時，沒有多餘的時間足供思考，應該迅速地以極堅定的態度，立即斷定何去何從。</p>
<p>渴望着成功的人們，別再猶豫不決，當機立斷是你們唯一的良藥！</p>

<h3>Various Pending Issues in the Military Reorganization Problem: Commander Ma Suggests Direct Talks, Political Consultative Conference Indefinitely Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Commander Ma once suggested to Zhou Enlai that he hoped Zhou could directly negotiate with Chairman Chiang regarding the various pending issues in the military reorganization problem. Commander Ma is willing to mediate. The other side may agree, but the meeting time has not yet been determined. According to foreign observers, if the two sides can directly negotiate, it may increase the convenience of resolving the problem.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Marshall spent the entire day resting today, only receiving the CCP representative of the Northeast Executive Headquarters, Jie Shi, at 5:30 PM to discuss the Northeast ceasefire issue.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is reported that if an agreement can be reached on the issue of the communist army's stationed areas during out-of-conference discussions, the Military Three-Man Committee can be convened. It is also heard that the Political Consultative Conference can only be reopened to decide on the date of convening the National Assembly, formulate the constitution, and reorganize the government to implement constitutional government after all three issues of ceasefire resumption and military reorganization have been fully agreed upon and signed.</p>
<p>[San Pao, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] This afternoon, the third party held a talk session at the former Central Bank, attended by Li Huang, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, and Mo Dehui. Shao Lizi was also invited to attend the meeting. After the meeting, according to Mo Dehui, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Subcommittee is not far off. As for the current dispute over the garrison areas for reorganization, it is only about Rehe and Luobei. In addition, Chen Qihuo, the representative of the Youth Party, returned to Nanjing this morning at 9:00 AM, and Huang Yanpei, the representative of the Democratic League, returned to Shanghai at 3:30 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] According to Chinese sources, in order to resolve part of the crisis of disputes, Special Envoy Marshall suggested appointing three high-ranking representatives from the KMT and CCP to form a special committee to discuss the issue of local governments, and Marshall himself need not participate. However, various observers insist that Marshall's mission is not only to make the negotiators establish detailed rules, but should also take further action, such as restoring mutual trust and canceling retaliatory acts. Unless Marshall can restore mutual trust between the parties, any agreement will be equivalent to a mere scrap of paper.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Since Minister of Propaganda Xu Chu's office and the municipal government issued a public announcement yesterday afternoon, adhering to a political solution to complete peaceful unification, the tense mood on both sides has suddenly calmed down. Today, political activities related to peace and commerce in Nanjing have been carried out because the three parties involved have been distracted and exhausted for months, day and night, in this arduous and unrewarding peace negotiation. Although the results are not without achievements, they have exhausted Special Envoy Marshall and the representatives of both sides, mentally and physically, and they have to take a short break to maintain their health. It is reported that this morning, Marshall quietly stayed at his residence. The military and horses on Ninghai Road were very scarce. The representatives of the government and the CCP did not engage in any activities either. General Xu Yongchang, due to frequent reports of battles in the Hubei-Henan area, took the opportunity to examine the Central Plains map in his office for a long time. From the current situation, the out-of-conference discussions of the Military Three-Man Committee, the focus of discussion may be to stop the conflict in the Central Plains, because Li Xiannian's communist troops in the Central Plains are becoming restless and have gathered a large army to move north. According to news this evening, the flames of war have already reached Xinyang near the Pinghan Railway, and the situation there is extremely serious.</p>

After the speech, Chairman Chiang gave instructions, saying: Although the war of resistance against Japan has been won, it is the most unfortunate thing for the country that the people cannot live and work in peace.

<h3>Chief of General Staff Chen Publishes Letter to Officers and Soldiers of the Country, Elaborating on the Significance of the Establishment of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ways to Strive in the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, a general, was sworn into office on the 1st and issued a letter to officers and soldiers nationwide.</p>
<p>The full text is as follows: Comrades, officers and soldiers of the whole country, the Ministry of National Defense of our government was officially established on June 23. Today is the day when the responsible officers at all levels of the Ministry are ordered to take office. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly present a few points on the significance of the establishment of the Ministry, the work that has been managed in the past, the urgent tasks to be completed at present, and the ways to strive in the future for the common recognition and compliance of all our officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>First, why do we want to establish the Ministry of National Defense, and what is the significance of establishing the Ministry of National Defense? I have already reported on this point when I attended the memorial week. It has been published in various newspapers. I think all comrades have seen it. All of you must know that a modern country must have a modern national defense to be able to stand independently in the world. Our country, due to the lessons and experiences learned from the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, should meet the needs of the national environment and conform to the trend of the world. Under the great courage and vision of the Chairman, and with reference to the US military system, the Ministry of National Defense was finally established, completing a major reform of China's epoch-making military affairs. This significance is very important, not only opening up a new reality in history but also symbolizing the bright future of China's national defense.</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the military institutions, the Chairman gave three instructions before the establishment of the Ministry: (1) It is hoped that all levels of generals can take the national interest as the premise. Based on the needs of the present and the future, it is necessary to adjust the military institutions; (2) The reorganization of the military institutions is entirely based on the US military system and organization; (3) The reorganization should be completed before the end of May of this year. The original military institutions of the Central Committee were reorganized in accordance with these instructions. After the reorganization, the original businesses of each institution will be handed over to the Ministry of National Defense for continued handling. As for the internal establishments at all levels, most of them have been determined. The responsible personnel at all levels have been successively announced. From the reorganization of the old institutions to the establishment of the new institutions, all businesses cannot be suspended for a day. However, there are still a few points that should be specially explained here:</p>
<p>(1) There are four points in the legal spirit of the Ministry of National Defense: (1) Taking political military as the basis and taking the Roman experiences of past wars, political military is the most appropriate for the use of national policies and the implementation of national defense. This concept is especially common in Britain and the United States. The reorganization of military institutions, the abolition of the Military Commission that is separated from the administrative branch, and the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense to be changed into the Executive Yuan are all in line with this intention. (2) To return the military to the country, the return of the military to the country is a consistent policy of our party. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time is to implement this policy. Our country will soon implement democratic constitutionalism and will not allow the military institutions to break away from the administrative system and become independent. (3) For the unified command of the army, navy, and air force, in modern warfare, the strategy and tactics of the military itself have constituted the unity of the army, navy, and air force. Moreover, due to the result of military modernization, the suddenness of war is extremely great. In order to cope with emergency measures, the army, navy, and air force must be unified in command. The reorganization of institutions is to adopt this system. (4) For the application of both peace and war, the organization of the Ministry of National Defense is based on the fact that the head of state concurrently serves as the Grand Marshal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in wartime, so this kind of organization can be applied whether in wartime or peacetime, so that it will not be at a loss due to sudden wars. This reform has four spirits, and it is to establish a century-old system and lay the foundation for the country's long-term peace and stability.</p>
<p>(2) There are two characteristics in the organization and operation of the Ministry of National Defense: (1) It is controlled by the government, and the "ability" of military expertise belongs to the military; (2) The concrete manifestation of the Tri-Services System. The Ministry of National Defense, on behalf of the government, has the power to supervise the planning of the General Staff Headquarters. The General Headquarters are responsible for the actual implementation. This fully demonstrates the spirit of the administrative Tri-Services System.</p>
<p>(3) The reorganization of the original military institutions is a transitional method for the Ministry of National Defense and is divided into three steps: (1) In the first step, the businesses of the original institutions that have not been completed will continue to be handled by the original institutions; (2) In the second step, according to the businesses of the new institutions, the staff of the original institutions, in addition to being incorporated into the new institutions as much as possible, will be properly arranged for the remaining staff. The detailed methods are the same as the personnel placement methods of the troops and will not be repeated here.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Economic Planning Conference</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Discussion Focused on the Economic Administration Outline for Next Year</p>

<p>Opinions of Various Committee Members</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The first meeting of the Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was chaired by Chairman Wang Yunwu. Wang explained each of the 20 articles of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' administrative outline for the 36th year, stating that although the national economic construction policy is decided by the Supreme Economic Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has the initial drafting power. Therefore, this outline was drafted for the committee members to make corrections. Subsequently, committee members such as Pan Mingxin, Gao Shukang, Wang Xiaolai, Hu Juewen, Yang Yinpu, Wu Qiyuan, and Wu YunChu successively expressed their opinions. The key points included: (1) National economic construction should be promoted in several regions, but the division of these regions need not be the same as the current provincial divisions; (2) Industrial association laws should be quickly drafted; (3) The active aspects of the economic administration outline should be adapted to the current domestic and international situation, and the passive aspects should include more "urgent" wording to address the current crisis in the industrial and commercial sectors. In addition, some committee members pointed out: (1) Reasonable regulations should be in place regarding land prices for newly established factories; (2) Industrial taxes should be lower than commercial taxes and tax exemptions should be considered; (3) Factory registration should be handled by the provincial government to avoid cumbersome layering; (4) In addition to strengthening the interest protection system, "profit protection" and "value preservation" should be further implemented. Today's focus was on the discussion of general principles, and specific issues will be studied tomorrow. Regarding industrial association laws, many people expressed at today's meeting that industrial associations must be separated from the current chamber of commerce laws. It was decided to appoint Yu Geyu, Xue Mingjian, and Ouyang Lun as a research group to submit the results to the general meeting for decision, and then send them to the legislative body for reference.</p>
<h3>A 106-Year-Old Woman Died Peacefully in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 1st] Liu Wang, a 106-year-old woman, passed away peacefully this morning. The funeral will be held tomorrow morning at the Anle Garden Cemetery outside Fengmen, with burial conducted according to Christian rites.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group Inspects Road and Port Projects; Group Leader Hou Jiayuan Talks to Reporters: Both Railways Should Be Equipped with Electrical Signals</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Hou Jiayuan, head of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, the staff recently dispatched to the south to inspect ports have returned to Shanghai. The team visited Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other places. A detailed report is currently being prepared regarding the situation of railways and important ports within the customs borders. The group has now dispatched two more teams: one to inspect the Yellow River Railway Bridge and the other to Qingdao, as there is a large amount of engineering machinery in Qingdao since its recovery, requiring experts to inspect it in detail. These two inspection teams are expected to return to Shanghai in about ten days. At that time, the inspection work within the customs borders will be fully completed.</p>
<p>Hou also stated that there are three major engineering projects that urgently need to be carried out: (1) Tanggu Bay; (2) The Yellow River Railway Bridge; (3) The Nanjing-Shanghai, Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The Tanggu Port project requires the most investment and time, while the railway projects are relatively simpler. He strongly advocates that both railways should be equipped with electrical signals because the total cost of electrical signals is only about US$3-4 million, which is only one-third of the cost of laying double tracks, while the transport capacity is equivalent to double tracks. This type of electrical signal can automatically warn oncoming vehicles during train travel, avoiding the danger of train collisions and saving excessive stopover time. The two railways can rely on this device to shorten travel time, increase the number of running vehicles, and thereby increase transport capacity. These electrical signals are commonly used in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and other places.</p>
<p>The (missing character) situation has been observed, and a detailed report has been submitted to the Executive Yuan. Once approved, the work will begin immediately. To meet the needs of the work, the group has appointed American engineers in Shanghai, including Zhusi (locomotive and vehicle engineer), Feifan (electrical signal engineer), Tietusi (port engineer), and Xu Na (railway engineer), to go to the United States to purchase building materials. They are scheduled to fly to the United States on July 3rd.</p>
<h3>The Major Traitor Wen Zongyao Was Tried in Nanjing Yesterday; The Trial Has Concluded, and the Verdict Will Be Announced on the 8th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Capital High Court publicly tried the major traitor Wen Zongyao this afternoon (the 1st). His family members were also present in the gallery. According to Wen's confession, he is currently eighty-two years old. On March 30th of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), he and Chen (omitted), the traitor Liang Hongzhi, organized the puppet Reformed Government, and held positions such as the President of the Legislative Yuan and the President of the Judicial Yuan in the puppet organization. He was arrested in Shanghai on September 28th of last year. Regarding the organization of the puppet Reformed Government, he cunningly claimed that it was "to relieve refugees and not out of dissatisfaction with politics." After the trial, the presiding judge announced that the verdict in this case would be announced at 2:00 PM on July 8th.</p>
<h3>The Retrial of the Chu Traitor Case</h3>
<p>His Wife Submitted a Petition to the Jiangsu High Court Yesterday, Requesting the Rejection of the Prosecutor's Appeal</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] The case of the Chu Minyi, the traitor to China, was ordered to be retried by the Suzhou High Court. The following day, the handling prosecutor, Li Shudong, filed an appeal, requesting the revocation of the retrial order. This document has now been submitted to the Supreme Court for a final decision. Chu (omitted) and Chen Shunzhen resubmitted a petition to the Suzhou High Court around 9:00 AM on the 1st, requesting that the Supreme Court reject the prosecutor's appeal. The reasons stated in the petition were roughly: Dr. Sun Yat-sen was deeply saddened by Chen Jiongming's rebellion, which destroyed all the drafts he had created over several years. This shows that Dr. Sun Yat-sen valued his original manuscripts very highly. The defendant's preservation of his original manuscripts should certainly be commended. Dr. Sun Yat-sen himself said that those who (omitted) him (omitted) would create unlimited benefits for the country and the nation. Therefore, preserving the legacy of the deceased is also beneficial to the nation and the country. The arguments in the appeal should be regarded as insignificant and do not show respect for Dr. Sun Yat-sen. His claim that it is not beneficial to the people is contrary to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's testament, and the appeal should be rejected.</p>
<h3>The Perpetrators of the Nanjing Massacre Should Be Executed on the Spot</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Nanjing Investigation Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Nanjing Massacre Investigation Committee, convened by the Nanjing City Council, held a meeting today, attended by Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, Ma Yuanfang, and others. They listened to a harrowing report on the massacre at the time and resolved to (omitted) the relevant authorities (omitted) to have the perpetrators of the massacre escorted to Nanjing for trial. All criminals sentenced to death should be executed on the spot to appease the wronged souls of the martyred soldiers and civilians.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Transported Japanese Prisoners from Northeast China; The U.S. Estimates Up to 700,000; All Are Laboring in Siberia</h3>
<p>Although the U.S. Has Repeatedly Questioned the Soviet Union, There Has Been No Formal Response</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] U.S. officials estimated today that the Soviet Union has transported approximately 700,000 Japanese troops from the nine northeastern provinces of China to Siberia for labor. This estimate is based on military reports from all units of the Japanese army in the nine northeastern provinces after the end of the war. Although the United States has repeatedly questioned the Soviet Union, Moscow has not provided a formal response. Authorities here consider this situation to be one of the international frictions. Another, albeit less important, indication of friction between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the United States to open a consulate in the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has had a consulate in Seoul, the American-occupied area of southern Korea. The United States, after months of negotiations, had requested the same privilege in Pyongyang, the city where the headquarters of the Soviet army in the north is located. The Soviet Union then closed its consulate in Seoul several months ago to end the dispute.</p>
<h3>Criminals' Families in Suzhou Prison Urge for Prompt Promulgation of Amnesty Order; Petition Cites Ancient and Modern Examples, Even Traitors Hope to Be Pardoned</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] Several hundred criminal and traitor convicts detained in Suzhou's Third Prison, in the name of all the prisoners' families, submitted petitions to the central authorities, including the National Government and the Executive Yuan, urging the prompt promulgation of an amnesty order to demonstrate the government's virtue of starting anew with the people. The original petition cited ancient and modern examples, stating that after the An Lushan Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty, lenient punishments were given, and officials involved in the Yuanyou factional strife in the Northern Song Dynasty were reinstated not long after. Citing recent examples, the British government, after its victory, formally announced that in the Southeast Asian region, those who cooperated with or were attached to the enemy would not be prosecuted if they did not help the enemy commit atrocities, and those who had been convicted would be released. Siam exempted criminals from prosecution by not applying laws retroactively. Norway only punished the arch-villain Quisling and pardoned the rest. The puppet Prime Minister of the Philippines, Roxas, was recently elected president. At a time when our country's industries are declining and the people are suffering, upholding virtue and commuting sentences are truly urgent matters. They request the government to follow the rule of the Zhou and Han dynasties and emulate the Tang and Song dynasties by issuing a special edict of amnesty.</p>
<h3>Surprisingly, a Traitor's Gate Produced a Filial Daughter; Jiang Kanghu, a Traitor of the Yangtze River, Fell Ill in Prison; His Daughter Insisted on Entering the Prison to Serve Him</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Jiang Kanghu, a traitor in North China, has been ill in prison for over ten days. His daughter, Jiang Zhaoju, has repeatedly requested the High Court to release him on bail for medical treatment, but all requests have been rejected. Jiang Zhaoju has recently insisted again on entering the prison to care for her father's illness. Initially, her request was not approved, but Jiang Zhaoju personally went to the High Court a few days ago, refusing to eat or sleep, and weeping in the courtyard all day long, refusing to leave. She pleaded to be allowed to enter the prison to care for her father's illness. President Zhao and Jin Shiding, the presiding judge of Jiang's case, were both moved. Since yesterday, she has been allowed to enter the prison twice a day to serve medicine and food, to fulfill her filial piety.</p>

<h3>Local Communications: Relieving Rural Areas in Northern Anhui; Agricultural Bank Handles Urgent Loans; Loan Amount of 63 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Communication] This time, the central government is holding agricultural loans for recovered areas. The national treasury has allocated 4 billion yuan, and Anhui Province has allocated 240 million yuan, ordering the Agricultural Bank of China to distribute it in three phases. It is learned that Wu Boju, a special agricultural loan officer from the Wuhu branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, has come to Bengbu to handle urgent loans for farmers in northern Anhui, including ten counties: Fengyang, Sixian, Suxian, Dingyuan, Wuhe, Huaiyuan, Lingbi, Mengcheng, Hao County, and Guoyang. The loan amount is 63 million yuan. Wu has already completed the loans in Fengyang. According to him, these urgent loans are applied for by the county cooperative societies or agricultural associations, and the loans are immediately granted at a monthly interest rate of two percent. The principal and interest are repaid within one year.</p>
<h3>Disaster Caused by Wind and Rain in Wenling; Heavy Damage on Land and Water</h3>
<p>[Our Wenling Communication] Since the evening of the 23rd, there has been heavy rain with strong winds and rough waves. Coastal dikes have collapsed in many places. The prison behind the county government was also destroyed by the wind. Due to mountain torrents, the water depth in the countryside is three to four feet, especially in the Shuiyang area in the north of the county, which is a vast expanse of water, and all the early rice crops have been submerged. The sweet potatoes, taro, beans, melons, and tobacco planted in the mountains were all blown down by the wind, causing serious damage. The offshore ship running between Jiangxia and Wenzhou stopped sailing due to the strong wind and tidal surge. The steamship on the Hetou Outer Luqiao also suspended service due to the rising river. All ships in various ports were suspended. All townships and towns announced the suspension of markets due to the flooding. The telegraph and telephone poles from the county seat to Yuhuan and Huangyan were all broken, and traffic was interrupted. On the 25th, the section from Kanmen to Wenling was repaired and restored. The section from Zeguo to the county seat is still blocked because the water depth in the countryside is several feet and has not yet receded, and technicians cannot rush to repair it. As of the 26th, it was still blocked. It is also reported that several fishing boats and merchant ships on the Shiling Sea were blown and sunk. A certain Chen in the Xian River of the county, who was transporting more than a thousand fir trees from Wenzhou, was also attacked and sunk by a strong wind and sea wave in the outer sea of Jiangxia. His life and death are unknown.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Security Units Save Money to Help Refugees</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Communication] The Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and its directly affiliated security units, all officers and soldiers, considered that the refugees in northern Jiangsu were wandering and suffering, without clothing or food, and were particularly pitiful. They donated one day's income, totaling 2,794,995 yuan, to the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association to help the refugees.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Public Buses Added New Routes</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Public Bus Company is jointly operated by the Municipal Government's investment and the China United Company. Since the opening of the two routes from the city station to the Lakeside and from the Lakeside to Yuquan, West Lake on June 10, the company has developed well due to its complete equipment and convenient passengers. It has now been decided to add routes on July 1 to meet the needs. Starting from the Lakeside, the route passes through Bijiao Gong, Tongchunfang, Pishi Lane Intersection, Cai Shi Bridge, Jingjie Kou, Suo Xiang Kou, Bao Shan Bridge, etc., with a total of eight stations, scheduled to run once every hour.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Economic Policy Cannot Stop at Planning</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently selected and appointed a group of economic planning committee members, with many figures from the industrial and commercial sectors participating. The Economic Planning Committee is holding a meeting in the capital starting yesterday, the main purpose of which is, of course, to formulate a sound economic plan. At this critical juncture of economic panic and production contraction, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' ability to convene a meeting to solicit diverse opinions is somewhat more satisfactory than doing nothing and standing idly by. However, we believe that the economic policy of a country should not be considered the end of a government's capabilities simply by formulating a plan. In other words, economic policy is valued for its implementation and must not stop at planning.</p>
<p>Plans, plans, we have heard and seen so many of them over the years. How many plans have actually been implemented? How many plans have been effectively executed? How many effectively executed plans have truly benefited the country and its people? These are issues that deserve serious reflection from both the government and the public. Therefore, if we are elated by the convening of the Economic Planning Committee and believe that the current economic crisis can be resolved and the government's economic policy can be realized, it seems overly optimistic and premature. Moreover, the subsequent economic plan still needs to be carefully discussed by this committee, and whether a practical and feasible plan can be formulated remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Speaking of meetings related to economic matters, as far as we know, there seem to be overlapping and redundant arrangements, with everything already covered. First, at the central level, there is the Supreme Economic Council, which has already been established, with the Premier and Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan serving as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. Its members include the heads of the five Yuan (branches of government) and the ministers of Finance, Economic Affairs, Food, Agriculture and Forestry, Transportation, and Social Affairs. Its nature is the highest planning and supervisory body for the national economy, and its high position and great power need not be emphasized. Second, the Executive Yuan regularly establishes the "Emergency Meeting for Stabilizing Finance," presided over by Premier Song himself, with the main tasks being: (1) determining monetary policy, (2) balancing revenue and expenditure, (3) managing the budget, (4) economizing consumption, and (5) allocating resources. This meeting, though named a financial meeting, is actually related to economic matters in every aspect. Third, it is now the turn of the Economic Planning Committee convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. We do not know whether this committee is a permanent meeting body or whether it is just a one-time meeting. But in any case, it seems to be a serious meeting. Even so, we have already seen three levels of meeting bodies. Moreover, under the current political system, the central decision-making bodies also include the highly placed Supreme National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee. It can be seen that there seems to be a surplus, rather than a shortage, of meeting bodies for deciding on plans. And why is it that when the country has reached such a severe economic crisis today, we still have to study economic plans? What exactly have these many meeting bodies, which should bear the responsibility for decision-making, been doing in the past?</p>
<p>If it is said that plans should be as detailed as possible? That plans should be discussed jointly with representatives of the people? Then, we must first have two common understandings, which are: (1) Plans must first establish basic principles. If there are no principles, or if there are principles but they are shelved, then planning will be difficult to start. (2) The National Political Council currently represents the general public, and the responsible persons of industrial and commercial legal entities in various regions represent industry and commerce. If the government truly wants to diligently seek public opinion and listen to the people's opinions on economic issues, it should recruit talents from these institutions. Now the Ministry of Economic Affairs is convening the Economic Planning Committee, and the intention is certainly commendable, but we hope that it can pay attention to these two points, otherwise it will inevitably become a mere formality. Regarding the latter, it is reported that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the preparatory committee of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce have successively telegraphed the government, requesting that a national economic conference be convened as soon as possible to achieve the task of truly communicating opinions between the government and the people and implementing economic policies. This will not be discussed in detail here. We will only talk about the prerequisites for formulating economic plans.</p>
<p>The basic principles of economic planning have actually been established by the government long ago. In the distant past, there was Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan, there were the hints in President Chiang's "China's Destiny," and there were the "Post-War First Phase Economic Construction Principles" passed by the 148th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on November 6, 1944. More recently, there were the outlines of various economic policies passed by the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang last year, and there were the economic emergency measures passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee in March this year. We must first ask: In the ten months since the victory, have all the actual economic measures taken by the government paid attention to the principles that the government had already established? Or have they simply forgotten the principles due to the complexity of events? Today's economic crisis is so deep. Is it because there is no plan? Or is it because many facilities often violate the original plan? If this point is not clarified, not to mention that this meeting of the Economic Planning Committee may not produce any results, even if a national economic conference is convened on a larger scale, it will inevitably lead to resolutions without implementation, which is equivalent to not discussing anything. The government's future economic measures will still be plans as plans, facts as facts, with neither paying attention to the other, and each going its own way. Even if there are great economic policies, they will only be seen to end up circling in the middle of "planning here, planning there"!</p>
<p>Let us give one example to prove that what has been said is not an exaggeration. For example, regarding the division of state-owned and private enterprises, looking at Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, President Chiang's instructions, and the provisions of the First Phase Economic Construction Principles, ordinary industry and commerce were not only allowed to be monopolized and included by state capital, but also allowed private operation. However, recently, in addition to the fact that most of the light industries such as textiles and silk have been state-owned, even the sugar transported from Taiwan has been changed to be sold exclusively by the government. What principle is this planned according to? And the strangest thing is that before the companies established by the government exclusively sold it, the market price of Taiwanese sugar was always within 50,000 yuan per bag when distributed by the industry, but once it was classified as state-owned, it soon rose to more than 110,000 yuan. Why do this? In any case, the government's economic plan at this time should not be directed towards leading price increases through monopolistic methods. However, what is currently being manifested by the facts is already like this. What better plan will be formulated in the future? Even if there is a good plan, how do we know how it will be implemented in practice? Economic problems have only allowed us to hear meetings and see plans until now. It is no wonder that the economic crisis is getting deeper day by day!</p>

<h3>Lieutenant General Blandy, Commander, Announces Successful Atomic Bomb Test: Target Ships Sunk Four, Damaged Twenty-Five; Bombing Deviated Slightly from Planned Target</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper News) San Francisco, 1st: Scientists, members of Congress, and UN observers felt a sense of disappointment at the lackluster scene of this morning's atomic bomb explosion. A Soviet professor shrugged and walked away as he watched the mushroom cloud rise, saying, "It's not that impressive."</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Blandy</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper News) San Francisco, 1st: Lieutenant General Blandy of the Navy believes the atomic bomb test was a success and announced the extent of the damage to the ships as follows: Two transport ships sunk; the US destroyer "Lamson" capsized; the US submarine "Scamp," the Japanese cruiser "Sakawa," the US aircraft carrier "Independence," and the US cruiser "Pensacola" heavily damaged; the US battleship "New York" and "Nevada," the Japanese carrier "Nagato," the US aircraft carrier "Saratoga," medium landing craft No. 1, oil tanker No. 160, the destroyer "Wilson," transport ships "Niagara," "Branden," "Penner," "Butt," "Föderguan," and several other ships were slightly damaged. Of the seventy-five ships loaded with guinea pigs, only seventeen were injured, twelve were injured. Radio facsimile devices set up three miles from the target area showed the explosion at the time was extremely alarming. When the atomic bomb exploded, the entire port bottom subsided. Then the radio facsimile screen suddenly turned completely white, possibly due to the flash of the bomb. When it cleared up, the palm trees along the coast were either uprooted or tilted, as if they had been ravaged by a typhoon.</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper News) San Francisco, 1st: Lieutenant General Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test, issued a second cold drink report, stating: Three ships sank after the atomic bomb was dropped this morning, another is sinking, and a total of twenty-five were heavily damaged.</p>
<h3>In an Instant of Bombing, the Flash and Smoke Soared into the Sky, with a Thunderous Sound that was Frightening, but Did Not Cause an Earthquake or Tsunami</h3>
<p>(Reuters New York, 30th) The atomic bomb was dropped and exploded at Bikini Atoll at 22:03 Greenwich Mean Time (7:03 AM Shanghai time on Monday morning), scattering a mushroom cloud that spread to 20,000 feet, completely covering the island. A bright yellow color appeared in the center, and the entire island disappeared into the smoke, fire, and water. The smoke column was 50,000 feet high, and several ships were engulfed in flames. After five minutes, the shapes of the ships could be seen. Super radio-controlled observation machines were destroyed. Minutes later, aircraft soared into the clouds to scout, and radio-controlled torpedo boats also sailed into the radio-active waters of the island for observation. Observers 140 miles away could see the explosion. According to a Columbia Broadcasting System interviewer who was closest to the atomic bomb explosion, the explosion did not feel like a tremor, nor was there a tsunami. Our reporter reported: The bomb exploded in 50 seconds, and the sound of thunder was not heard until two minutes later. The bomb deviated slightly from the target, as the "Nagato" could still be seen after the smoke cleared.</p>
<p>Unmanned Aircraft Landed Safely</p>
<p>(Associated Press Garin, 1st) Blandy broadcasted: "The drift of the cloud is as expected, but there is no danger to anyone or the nearby islands." It is reported that all radio-controlled drones that passed through the toxic mist to measure the radiation energy of the atomic bomb have landed safely. Blandy confirmed that the atomic bomb that bombed Nagasaki was more effective and destructive than the one that bombed Hiroshima. He said, "No one is allowed into the lagoon until everything is absolutely safe."</p>
<p>According to Honolulu: Hawaii did not record anything in this morning's atomic bomb explosion.</p>
<p>According to Parsons, Deputy Officer of the Atomic Bomb Test: This explosion can be equivalent to a thousand tons of bombs, and damage in the bombed area can be measured later. However, this kind of pregnancy should be kept secret. According to a reporter on the ship Appalachian: Minutes after the atomic bomb was dropped, dark smoke gushed up from the lagoon. Looking at it through black glasses, the flash was very faint, like distant lightning. Then a narrow pink, neat toxic mist was seen quickly rising. About ninety seconds later, a rumbling sound was heard, like thunder or distant naval gunfire. On the thunder screen, the target "Nevada" and the Japanese ship "Nagato" could be seen, and the aircraft carrier "Independence" was on fire.</p>
<p>According to an aerial broadcast: The explosion of the bomb appeared to be slightly distant from the target, deviating towards the aircraft carrier "Independence," and the upper structure seemed to be partially blown up. The Appalachian, 15 miles from the explosion, also reported that the bomb missed the target, with the battleship "Nevada" in the middle, which was planned as a target ship. After the explosion, it could still be seen outside.</p>
<h3>The Atomic Bomb Dropped Was Made Using Plutonium</h3>
<p>(Associated Press Reporter Ship Parachin near Bikini, 30th) Atomic expert Dr. Compton recently announced: The atomic bomb that was dropped was made using Plutonium.</p>
<h3>With Intertwined Sound and Light, it Was a Spectacle: A Central News Agency Reporter's Eyewitness Account</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from CNA Reporter Song Dehe, aboard the US ship Appalachian, outside Bikini, 1st) The experiment to observe swelling has seen the atomic bomb explode within the original scheduled time today. Using a special black dragon, we first saw the first flash pass, like a full eye rising from the horizon. Immediately, a huge white, neat layer was in the sky above the sea, and the orange fireball was full of diffuse distribution. A high column of white clouds immediately shot into the air, forming a huge makeup special. Then it disappeared into the natural cloud layer staying in the target area. The sound of the explosion reached eighteen miles away. It had been over a hundred and thirty-three seconds when it reached our ears. Its solemn ceremony was similar to the weak artillery fire from Dada Place that the elder of the year heard in Taierzhuang. The natural cloud layer was scattered after a few minutes. At this time, only the long-term special of the "atomic cloud layer" was seen, the edge was white, but the center was hot red. Nine minutes later, the height of the state column was only 24,000 feet, which was less than the atomic cloud layer of the previous three times, and its bottom layer had disappeared.</p>
<h3>Albania and Yugoslavia Take a Hostile Attitude Towards Greece; Incidents Occur Repeatedly in the Macedonian Region</h3>
<p>(Reuters Athens, 30th) Yesterday morning, twenty armed bandits crossed into Greek territory from Albania, inciting nearby Greek villagers to take up arms, and alleging that the Greek government violated the "Fermor Chai Convention." Incidents have also occurred repeatedly in the Macedonian region. The Albanian Prime Minister has also recently taken a hostile attitude towards Greece with Yugoslavia, and it is said that the friendship treaty between Albania and Yugoslavia may include a military coordination agreement. If the Foreign Ministers' Conference assigns North Epirus to Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia may take joint action.</p>
<h3>Meticulous Arrangements Before Bombing: "Dave's Dream," the Star Bomber; Mobilized Over 40,000 People, Only One Injured</h3>
<p>"French News Agency Atomic Bomb Viewing Basket 'Appalachian' 1st" Atomic bomb test commander Lieutenant General Blandy announced this afternoon: More than 40,000 staff and visitors of this atomic bomb explosion test were completely unharmed. The only one affected was the atomic bomb bomber, who failed to think about covering his eyes after bombing, causing him to be affected by the flash. This atomic bomb explosion proved to be equal to the power of the bomb used to bomb Nagasaki in August last year. At present, a large number of speculations on the results of the test can only be announced to the world after scientific investigation.</p>
<p>(Reuters New York, 30th) The super-fortress "Dave's Dream" that dropped the atomic bomb departed from Kwajalein Atoll at 18:50 standard time (3:50 AM Shanghai time on Monday morning). At that time, the morning light on the Pacific Ocean was dim, and although the climate was not perfect, the test was not hindered at all. In order to prevent accidents, thousands of people who were not needed on the island were evacuated in advance. Our reporter, Lechte, reported from the American ship Appalachian: Ships were arranged in a circle around the horseshoe-shaped coral reef outside Bikini Atoll, and all 161 residents on the island had been evacuated long ago. Several core physicists loaded the atomic bomb into the bomb bay of "Dave's Dream." When the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet, two experts took over the assembly of the atomic bomb, and then the bomber prepared to drop it.</p>
<p>Complete Test Photography Record</p>
<p>The super-fortress frame subsequently recorded all film records. Several other cameras, some of which were radio-controlled, were also prepared to capture all test records. Half an hour after the explosion, a naval aircraft returned to inspect the area 2,000 feet in the air above the explosion site. If the radio wave activity is not very intense, two more aircraft will be sent to ascend to a few feet from the island surface to collect some soil for inspection. At the same time, six gunboats carrying radio experts and radio measuring instruments will sail close to the coral island to test the activity of radio waves. The flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant General Blandy, is moored 12 miles from the island, and all reports are sent to the ship, and Blandy will then decide when to allow ships to enter the target area. He will say that several hours after the explosion, the second stage of radio experts will enter to study the radio wave activity of the target ships. When they send a signal to deregulate, six landing craft will carry the first batch of people to the coral reef to quickly investigate the damage. The reserve personnel and reporters will land later.</p>
<p>Detailed Results to Be Announced</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Blandy said: The results that can be announced will be announced to the public in a few days, at most a few weeks. Scientific research on these results will take longer. The last person on Bikini Atoll was evacuated at midnight. One hundred and fifty ships and 40,000 personnel participating in the unknown were evacuated from noon yesterday. The ship carrying the reporters was moored about 20 miles northwest of the target. After receiving a weather report a few hours later, Lieutenant General Blandy announced that the test was underway. At midnight, the instruments on the target ship began to make sounds. At this time, only the cries of various animals on the ship and the sound of waves on the sea surface were heard. The subsequent sound waves were the sound of the atomic bomb exploding. After the bomb disappeared, 40,000 scientists, practitioners, and observers will remove their protective glasses and wait for the signal to deregulate so that they can enter the target area to inspect the old ships, such as Bikini Island and Nevada, and the instruments suspended on the necks of 200 pigs, 300 sheep, 3,000 white mice, and various animals for verification.</p>
<p>Good Weather on the Coral Reef</p>
<p>(Associated Press Kwajalein Atoll, 1st) "Dave's Dream" pilot Swenke德 gained the qualification to drive because of his technical preparation for test flights with fake atomic bombs. As the bomber took off, 30 other aircraft participating in the test were already waiting in the air. Shortly before "Dave's Dream" ascended, Major Wood, the bomber, told the broadcasters: I hope to hit the target ship "Nevada" with one blow. When asked what would happen if the target was missed? Wood replied: "I will change course." Atomic bomb test commander Lieutenant General Blandy said on the flagship "McKinley" late yesterday: The air climate on the coral reef this morning is better than expected. I guarantee that the first atomic bomb will be dropped according to the scheduled time. According to the news from San Francisco early this morning: Blandy ordered the bombing time to be delayed by about 50 minutes compared to the planned time.</p>
<h3>No Explosion Records Were Measured Anywhere</h3>
<p>(Associated Press Sydney, Australia, 1st) The question measurement station announced today: The seismograph of this station did not measure the atomic bomb explosion record of Bikini Coral.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency Tokyo 1st Associated Press" The Japanese Central Meteorological Observatory recently stated: At present, Japan has not observed any significant impact caused by the Bikini atomic bomb explosion.</p>
<h3>Parisians Worry About the Sky Falling</h3>
<p>(French News Agency Paris, 1st) Richard Nas of the US delegation to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and many other US representatives focused on a room in the Musey's Belly Museum (the US delegation's style) today. The group received radio reports about the atomic bomb test on Bikini Coral Reef in the Pacific Ocean, but the broadcast sound often disappeared, or was blocked, making it difficult to listen. Most Parisians who are overly sensitive are deeply afraid that the effect of atomic bomb bombing may affect the other side of the earth, so they have gone to earthquake observatories in various parts of Paris to ask whether they have measured explosion records and whether Parisians can sleep soundly. In fact, they could not get a satisfactory answer, because the radiation force of the atom must reach Paris after 15 hours, and records can be made on measuring instruments. At that time, if any records are measured, they will be published.</p>
<h3>Hiroshima Residents Turn Pale at the Mention of Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>(Associated Press Hiroshima, 1st) Hiroshima is the capital city bombed by atomic bombs. Its residents are like islands of crossbows and arrows, turning pale when they hear of atomic bombs. Now they are also concerned about the results of the Bikini test. Mayor Kihara said that Hiroshima's being bombed by atomic bombs is actually the first step towards peace. The residents of Hiroshima have learned from their pain and are willing that atomic energy will never be seen in war again, but can be used to promote civilization.</p>
<p>(Associated Press Kwajalein, 1st) Brigadier General Lemay used to ride a B-29 aircraft and drop atomic economists on Japan. It is said that today's atomic bomb test "performance is wonderful," but the bomb is not as powerful as the one dropped on Nagasaki.</p>

<h3>Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting Turns Positive; French Compromise Proposal Under Discussion; Italy Reserves Details of Ship List to be Published</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The Foreign Ministers' Meeting is rapidly turning positive. It is expected that an agreement on convening a 21-nation conference will be reached at today's meeting. At Saturday's five-hour meeting of the four foreign ministers, the compromise solution for the Port of Trieste proposed by France was agreed by the other three foreign ministers as a basis for discussion. Revisions were accommodated yesterday, and the formal agenda for today's Foreign Ministers' Meeting is: (1) the Trieste issue, (2) the issue of Italian colonies, (3) the date for convening the 21-nation conference, and (4) the German issue. The four foreign ministers may not be able to complete the entire agenda, but if the Trieste issue can be resolved, at least the draft Five-Power Treaty can reach the stage where it can be submitted to the 21-nation conference. A decision was also reached on the Danube River clause during Saturday's discussions, and it is expected that the draft treaties with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria will no longer be problematic. The Finnish treaty has long been completed, with only some clauses requiring textual revisions. The Italian reparations issue remains unresolved, but once the Trieste issue is resolved, the reparations issue will also face little obstruction.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Before the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting, negotiations were completed regarding the division of Italian warships. France decided to allow Italy to retain a portion of its warships. Details of the retained portion have now been published, stipulating that Italy may retain:</p>
<p>Two heavy cruisers, four destroyers, sixteen torpedo boats, and nineteen minesweepers.</p>
<h3>Ethnic Clash in Southern Italy; Trieste in Chaos</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 1st (Broadcast): While the foreign ministers are discussing the Trieste issue without reaching an agreement, the port is now in a state of chaos. Last night, dozens of people armed with clubs killed an Italian worker, and 200,000 workers went on strike today to protest. Also last night, several grenade explosions occurred, killing one person and injuring thirty, including nine American soldiers.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Indonesian Government Officials; Perpetrated by the Fifth Column; Prime Minister Sjahrir Has Escaped</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 1st (Broadcast): The Prime Minister of the Republic of Indonesia, Sjahrir, who was kidnapped, has escaped and been escorted to the government headquarters by the army. Other kidnapped officials, such as Economic Minister Darmawan, are also safe.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 30th] The President of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno, recently delivered a broadcast speech, urging the extremists who kidnapped Prime Minister Sjahrir and other active officials to release them as soon as possible, to avoid causing a bad impression abroad. He also said that this matter could be used by the Netherlands as an excuse to occupy all of Indonesia. "I do not want to become a dictator, nor do I want to concentrate all power in myself, even temporarily. I plan to go to Solo to rescue the Prime Minister with all my strength, even resorting to force if necessary. If this effort fails, there is no doubt that the extremists will be able to control the interior." It is reported that the kidnapping was carried out by the Fifth Column, whose leader, Marajah, was imprisoned several months ago for conspiring to revolt against the government. The party kidnapped government officials in retaliation. In addition, the kidnappers were very dissatisfied with the East Indonesian government's consultations with the Allied authorities, and resorted to kidnapping government officials as a means of expressing their dissatisfaction.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Actively Researching; Cosmic Rays' Destructive Power Exceeds Atomic Bomb</h3>

<h3>International Tribunal Continues to Try Japanese War Criminals; Former Japanese Interior Minister Gotō Fumio Testifies About the Inner Workings of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association; Says It Aims to Control All Political Activities in Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] Today, the prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal presented a document from the Japanese government to the court, proving that some of the Japanese war criminals on trial were previously connected to the ultranationalist Black Dragon Society, and all the groups that participated in the society were listed in detail. Among them was a group led by former Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki and former Army Minister Aoki. According to witness Ugaki Kazushige, the greatest power in controlling the Japanese army, apart from the Emperor, should be the Chief of the General Staff. The defense attorney repeatedly questioned Ugaki, hoping to prove that Minami Jiro was indeed powerless to stop the expansion of the Northeast Incident in 1931. In addition, Gotō Fumio, who served as Interior Minister in the Okada Cabinet for three days in 1936, was also brought from Sugamo Prison to testify. In his testimony, Gotō stated that in 1940, he cooperated with Konoe to establish a society called the Taisei Yokusankai (Imperial Rule Assistance Association), and Hashimoto Kingorō was one of its members. After the establishment of the Taisei Yokusankai, no other important political parties or organizations existed in Japan. The purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai was to establish a political group in Japan that was entirely controlled by the government. The Taisei Yokusankai was subsidized by the government, and each region had a branch. When the defense attorney questioned Gotō, the court observers felt that his questions were not to the point. Chief Justice Webb questioned Gotō, and Gotō testified that the Taisei Yokusankai was to help the Japanese people fulfill their responsibilities to the country. Webb then asked, "What are the Japanese people's responsibilities to the country?" Gotō replied that it was the responsibility that the Japanese people must fulfill. When asked if the responsibilities included military matters, he replied yes. Hashimoto Kingorō's defense attorney asked if the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai was not to incite the Japanese people to initiate this illegal and inhumane war. Gotō replied that the purpose of the association was not that. Webb later declared that the association seemed to be a mechanism for government officials to control the people.</p>
<h3>400,000 Japanese Postal Workers Begin General Strike; Civil Servants' Problem Resolved</h3>

<h3>Director Wu Talks About Food Management; Resolves Not to Fear Rice Merchants' Threats; Municipal Government Directly Allocates Grain to Rice Shops</h3>
<p>Still Urging Rice Traders to Purchase; Licenses Will Be Revoked if They Are Unwilling to Operate</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu declared yesterday: The North and South Rice Markets will be established on the 3rd of this month, so the newly established Grain Management Section of the Social Affairs Bureau has also stepped up preparations to ensure that it can officially start work before the 3rd. The section chief has been internally appointed to be concurrently held by Bureau Specialist Jiang Jiming.</p>
<p>Regarding the future grain management measures, Director Wu said: In the past, the Food Department often dumped rice as soon as it had it, which led to the department's rice ending up in the hands of rice merchants. Sometimes, even a single rice merchant would purchase all of it, which did not seem appropriate. In the future, the municipal government will directly allocate rice to each rice shop, reducing the exploitation of rice traders in the middle. Therefore, the difference between this management and the past is that the previous sales were unlimited, while now it is a limited allocation.</p>
<p>In the future, rice shops should first register with the Social Affairs Bureau, and then the bureau will determine the allocation quantity based on the business situation of each rice shop. The bureau will also investigate the rice storage quantity of each rice shop at any time to make reasonable adjustments. Although the bureau will no longer have a relationship with the rice traders, it will still urge them to purchase. They will still be able to sell their purchased rice to the market in the future, but it will not be related to the government.</p>
<p>In the past, rice traders opposed price controls and did try to coerce the government, and some expressed that they were unwilling to lose money and would rather not operate rice businesses. The government has decided to revoke the licenses of these rice merchants who have expressed their unwillingness to continue operating. The rice price in the producing areas has always fluctuated depending on the Shanghai market price. Since the Shanghai rice price has not risen sharply, there is no reason for the price in the producing areas to be high. The current problem lies in the fact that the rice in the producing areas has already ended up in the hands of rice merchants. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to send personnel to Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, Jinshan, Changzhou, and other producing areas to investigate whether Shanghai rice merchants have purchased rice and what the purchase quantity is. After rice merchants buy rice, they often store it in the countryside. Because the jurisdiction is different, the municipal government has no right to intervene. However, when Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang came to Shanghai last time, the municipal government consulted with Chairman Wang, and Chairman Wang has expressed his willingness to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Rice and grain were indeed more difficult to obtain in February and March, but the municipal government is currently trying to find a way to solve the problem with tribute rice and foreign rice, and it is believed that there will definitely be a solution. Rice merchants are now indeed fighting against the government, and their courage is quite admirable, but the municipal government is not afraid of such threats!</p>
<p>The more than 7,000 shi of rice that are currently being allocated are all top-quality white rice. If there are cases where it is not possible to buy rice, it is feared that there are still corrupt merchants at play. It is hoped that such cases will be reported for investigation. In the future, rice shops that receive allocations must mark the rice price, otherwise the allocation will be stopped. Those who refuse to sell after receiving the allocation will be severely punished. The current price limit is 46,000 yuan per shi, plus a 6% profit and some transportation costs. Although some rice merchants have requested a price increase, the municipal government has decided to maintain the original price and will not change it. As for government agencies, schools, training centers, and other institutions that need more rice, the government can allocate it. Factories and larger companies can be issued procurement certificates by the Social Affairs Bureau, and they can designate the procurement area themselves. Several yarn factories have already applied to the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>The rice from the Food Administration has not yet been sent to the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu said, "If it is to be handed over, it must be handed over in full." According to reports, in addition to the rice reserves, the administration also has assets such as flour mills. As for the negotiations after Food Minister Xu came to Shanghai, Director Wu said that he did not know anything about it, only that Minister Xu was discussing with the Mayor.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Yangtze River Santeh Rice to Rice Shops</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the people's livelihood, the authorities have allocated the Yangtze River Santeh and other stored rice to various rice shops to provide rice for retail sales. The work did not stop even on Sunday, and the allocation was completed by noon yesterday. At that time, the entrance of the Bank of China warehouse on Suzhou North Road was crowded with rice shop employees waiting for the goods to be shipped. It is reported that the rice allocated this time is entirely top-quality white rice produced in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, and other places, and a total of 873 rice shops throughout the city were allocated, with each shop receiving 10 to 15 shi.</p>
<h3>District Prosecutor's Office; Interrogates Grain Loan Case This Morning</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The grain loan case is still being handled separately by the military and judicial organs. The District Prosecutor's Office will reopen the investigation court this morning, but Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Xunzhi are still detained at the Garrison Headquarters. The headquarters sent a letter to the Accountants Association a few days ago, requesting them to send personnel to assist in auditing the accounts of grain merchants, but they have not yet received anyone as of yesterday. However, the Food Administration's reply has already been received. It is reported that the points Wang Daren mentioned in his confession involving the Food Administration are all facts.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan Speaks; Sichuan and Jiangxi Rice Being Transported Downstream; Land Tax in Kind and Local Tax Revenue Increased; Fair Judgment in the Grain Loan Case</h3>
<p>Food Minister Xu Kan said yesterday: (1) This time, I was ordered by President Song to come to Shanghai to discuss the livelihood of the Shanghai people. In recent days, I have been following President's instructions and have had multiple discussions with Mayor Wu. Concrete decisions have been made on increasing rice sources, stabilizing prices, and managing the market. The 30,000 shi of Sichuan and Jiangxi rice transported by the Cai E and Jiang Yi ships under the Ministry have arrived in port on June 29th and 30th, respectively. We are continuing to increase transportation capacity in various ways and continuously transport rice downstream from Sichuan and Jiangxi, as well as purchasing and transporting foreign rice to balance the supply and demand of food in Shanghai. (2) The land tax will still be collected in kind this year, as decided by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. The Finance and Food Conference only discussed the implementation methods. Since the revision of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, the land tax in kind has become more important to local finances. The central government only receives 30%, while the provinces and counties receive 70%. Therefore, the land and grain agencies and grain collection businesses of each province have been transferred to the provincial governments for management since July 1st. The Food Administration is only in a supervisory and assessment position. (3) The decisions and methods regarding food have been carefully considered. If the staff has abandoned their duties or committed corruption, and if merchants have violated the law or engaged in malpractice, they have been reported and are now being tried by military and judicial authorities, and there will be a fair judgment.</p>

After briefly exchanging greetings with the welcomers at the pier, he took a car to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest. He met with reporters at 4 p.m. and talked about his visit to the United States. He had been to all major cities except North America and had extensively visited railway factories. When reporters asked about his impressions of his visit to the United States and how to promote China's industrialization, Zeng said that he needed to consider them before answering. One reporter asked if Zeng would be appointed Minister of Railways, and he said that he had not heard anything about it. Zeng will go to Nanjing in a few days.</p>

<h3>Zheng Yongzhi, Ye Qianyu, Situ Huimin to Go to the US to Study Film Industry</h3>
<p>Film Industry Colleagues Held Farewell Tea Party Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, colleagues from the Chinese film industry held a tea party at the New Life Club to bid farewell to Zheng Yongzhi, Ye Qianyu, and Situ Huimin, who are going to the United States to study the film industry. Around sixty to seventy figures from the film, theater, and literary and artistic circles attended, including Luo Jingyu, Shi Dongshan, Yuan Congmei, Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Feng Hezi, Zhang Guangyu, Ding Cong, and Kang Jian. Guo Moruo also came, hurriedly signed his name and wrote a poem, and then hurriedly left, saying that he still had to visit Zeng Zhaolun. The tea party was chaired by Luo Jingyu, and Luo Xuelian and Xiong Foxi delivered farewell speeches. Xiong said, "American film techniques have undoubtedly reached their peak, but the consciousness and direction are still debatable." He hoped that "China's future film industry should develop among the people and become something shared by the masses." Shi Dongshan pointed out that everything in America is like water, and if used improperly, it could become the Yellow River, only producing flooding and destruction. He hoped it could become "West Lake." Miss Bai Yang's words were very brief. In a sweet and gentle voice, she wished the three travelers "smooth sailing."</p>
<p>Following this, Zheng, Ye, and Situ delivered farewell speeches. Zheng Yongzhi was formerly the director of the China Film Studio. This time, he is going to the United States on government orders to study film administration. Zheng said briefly: During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the more than eight hundred film workers in the rear areas endured great hardships, and some even sacrificed their lives, producing nearly a hundred films with crude tools. However, in terms of supporting the Anti-Japanese War, this was actually insufficient. Therefore, he wished to use the stones from other mountains to learn from. He hoped that those going to the United States would not only go to see, but also to experience and work in the field. Finally, he pointed out the three periods of the American film industry: the pre-war period was the commercial capital period, the wartime period was the government control period, and the future should be a democratic industrial period with the joint efforts of national industrialists.</p>
<p>Ye Qianyu is one of China's famous cartoonists (and also the creator of the cartoon character "Mr. Wang"). During the Anti-Japanese War, he devoted himself to painting and went to Xikang and India to collect painting materials. In mid-May of this year, he received an invitation from the US State Department, valid for one year, asking him to introduce modern Chinese cartoons to the New World. At the same time, he was also entrusted by "China Film Studio" to study the production of Hollywood cartoons. His state of mind, he called "very contradictory." He said, "At a time when all problems in China cannot be solved, going to the United States seems to have the suspicion of escaping reality." In his heart, he would very much like to stay here and work hard alongside his friends; but "in fact, what can be done by staying here?" His deep words showed the bitterness in his heart. The unrestful living environment seems to have made the emotions of every cultural worker sentimental and painful.</p>
<p>Situ Huimin is going "for personal reasons." The task given to him by "China Film Studio" is to study directing techniques. He will first go to Ottawa, Canada, to see the new developments in documentary films. He said, "My body and mind have been dedicated to this cause, and I am willing to work hard forever in this area for China's democracy and prosperity."</p>
<p>Zheng Yongzhi will board the "General Meigs" ship tonight and set off for the United States tomorrow morning. Ye and Situ will postpone their departure by two weeks because their ship tickets have not been arranged.</p>
<p>At around 5:00 PM, the tea party ended in a cordial atmosphere. The heavy rain outside the door temporarily kept the reluctant friends from parting.</p>

<h3>New Tricks Discovered in Former German Residents' Houses. Authorities Are Investigating the Truth.</h3>
<p>House Allocation Begins Implementation. Few Cultural Institutions Benefit.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The House Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan, because German residents in this city will soon be repatriated, has allocated their houses to various institutions in advance. However, in recent days, more than half of the institutions have returned their allocation and acceptance documents. It is said that when these institutions went to take over the houses, only one of the originally assigned four rooms remained. Large rooms have become small rooms, and small rooms can only accommodate the space for a single military bed. It is clear that a "switch" has occurred. After learning of this, the committee, together with the German Residents Management Committee, went to various places for strict investigation, starting in six directions. The investigation will be completed this morning. Then, they will check against the roster previously registered by the German residents and reallocate accordingly. If it is found that the German residents have indeed committed fraud, they will be punished.</p>
<p>[Another News] The house allocation work of the House Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan for various institutions in Shanghai is about to begin. At the committee's regular meeting at 2:00 PM today, it may first allocate some of the houses applied for by various institutions, including a small number of cultural institutions. It is also learned that because a certain eight cultural institutions in this city are in dire need of housing, Mayor Wu has instructed the Municipal Government's Materials Receiving Office to allocate small shops that have been received for their use.</p>
<p>The House Allocation Committee held a subcommittee meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. It was decided that: (1) Approximately two hundred non-enemy-property houses currently occupied by Japanese residents will be allocated in advance. (2) The number of German residents being repatriated, which was originally about four hundred, has now increased, so the number of houses allocated in the future can also be increased. The above two points will be brought up for discussion at the regular meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon for a final decision.</p>

<h3>Wife of Director of Railways Bureau Embezzlement Case Flees</h3>
<p>Total Embezzlement Exceeds 100 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Railways Bureau discovered the shocking embezzlement case in the Materials Department of the Two Railways Bureau, it handed over Zhang Hongtu, the director of the department, Zhang Bokang, the section chief, and other related personnel to the bureau's police department for custody and interrogation on the 25th of last month. As of last night, the total amount of embezzlement uncovered reached 121,700,000 yuan, and Yu Xiangyan (张鸿图's wife), the main culprit related to the case, is still at large. Yesterday, Chen Bozhuang, director of the bureau, told reporters: "I deeply regret this case after it happened. After the interrogation, it has been found that no other personnel from other departments are involved except for the personnel from the Materials Department. According to the law, these criminal offenders should be sent to the judicial organs. However, because the amount of embezzlement is too large, I have ordered all related parties to first hand over all the funds within 48 hours to the public (that is, from 9:00 PM on the 1st to 8:00 PM on the 3rd), and then ask the Ministry of Communications for instructions."</p>
<p>Discovery Process</p>
<p>[Another News] Chen also recounted the embezzlement facts of Zhang Hongtu and the discovery process, saying: Zhang Hongtu, director of the Materials Department, from Liaoning, originally served as an assistant to the Materials Department of the Ministry of Communications. After the victory, the ministry sent him to assist me in receiving the Beijing-Shanghai railways, and then he was appointed as the director of the Materials Department. At the end of last year, instigated by his wife Yu Xiangyan (from Jiashan, addicted to opium), he began to embezzle small amounts, soliciting commissions for purchasing materials. Since March of this year, the personnel of our bureau have become stable, and I began to rectify the business, paying attention to materials first, so for more than a month, I did not dare to take commissions. However, in late April, Yu again instigated her husband to embezzle on a large scale, collecting commissions of 10% for all material purchases. Yu also directly solicited bribes as the director's wife. On May 29, a staff member of the purchasing section of the Materials Department secretly reported, and some others confessed, reporting in detail. I immediately conducted an investigation based on the report and ordered Deputy Director Hou to implement all matters related to the Materials Department. The embezzlement behavior of the department in soliciting commissions gradually subsided. Because the police department's personnel investigated effectively, the truth of the case has come to light. I am determined to handle it strictly according to the law.</p>
<p>Speeches</p>
<p>Chen Bozhuang specifically summoned more than 300 officers above the rank of director of the bureau to the auditorium at 8:45 PM last night to give speeches. In addition to reporting the details of the interrogation of the case, he hoped that all colleagues would cherish themselves, abide by the law, and pay attention to three points: spiritual construction, institutional construction, and technical construction. Regarding employee benefits, they have been adjusted since May of this year. The minimum salary is 100,700 yuan per month. In addition, employee welfare matters are being handled to ensure that employees' minimum living needs are met. However, he encouraged all colleagues to embrace the spirit of sacrifice and serve the country and the railway faithfully. Deputy Directors Luo Meilun, Hou or Hua Chen Fuhai gave speeches separately, encouraging all colleagues to earnestly follow the director's instructions.</p>

<h3>Tian Sheng Tang Chinese Medicine Store Kidnapping Case Solved; Young Hostage Rescued from Shantytown in Zhabei</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Tian Sheng Tang Chinese Medicine Store at 564 Yuyao Road was robbed of property by five or six armed bandits on the evening of the 19th of last month. When leaving, they kidnapped Chen Xiaomaotou, the five-month-old young owner, and fled. After the Criminal Police Division of the Municipal Police Bureau ordered police officers to work hard to investigate, they finally arrested the main culprit, Wang Ruizhong, in a shantytown in Zhabei on the 20th and rescued the young hostage on the spot. Later, accomplices Deng Ganchen, Yang Zhentao, Liu Laosi (also known as Liu Lang), Chen Keyou (also known as Xiaorenzi), and Sun Zhenhua were arrested one after another. Another suspect, Fan San, is still at large. According to Wang Ruizhong's confession: he is from Funing and used to be a plainclothes police officer at the Jinshan County Police Bureau. He is currently unemployed. At 8:00 PM on June 17, he gathered with Yang Zhentao, Deng Ganchen, Liu Laosi, Chen Keyou, Sun Zhenhua, and the fugitive Fan San at the Bund Park. At that time, Yang Zhentao led a woman named Sisao, who said that the Tian Sheng Tang Chinese Medicine Store on Yuyao Road was quite wealthy, with a single young child who was especially loved. If the child could be kidnapped, they could get 6 million to 10 million yuan. Everyone agreed and decided to act on the night of the 19th. When the store was closing, they took the opportunity to enter and robbed 200,000 yuan in cash, two gold rings, and a watch. When they left, Fan San took the young owner Chen Xiaomaotou away. The bandits had previously committed four theft cases, including 9 Ruiji Lane, Jiaxing Road, 23, Lane 768, Wuding Road, a certain number, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, and Tongxin Restaurant, 28 Huai'an Road. The rest of the criminals' confessions are the same. The interrogation has now been completed, and it is planned to submit the case to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation and handling in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Trial of Traitors: Rao Shu Shameless; Sun Shaokang Asks for Tea</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court interrogated several major traitors yesterday, including Feng Jie, general manager of the puppet China Film Company, Rao Shu, chief inspector of the special high section of the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, and Sun Shaokang, president of the puppet Shanghai Local Court. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Feng Jie, from Guangdong, 43 years old, wearing a blue cloth long shirt and black cloth shoes, was thin and pale. According to his confession, he graduated from Guangdong Higher Normal School. He taught in Guangdong and Hong Kong before the Anti-Japanese War. He joined the puppet government in 1940 under the orders of the central government and worked for the central government in various ways during his time in the puppet government.</p>
<p>Rao Shu, from Wuhu, Anhui, wore a Huzhou silk long shirt in the morning when the trial began. He held a black paper fan in his hand, fanning himself from time to time, and answered boldly and shamelessly. According to him, he was ordered by the Central Statistics Bureau to work at the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, using false information from the Central Statistics Bureau to exchange for real information from the Japanese Embassy. After the August 13th Incident, he left. On September 22, 1940, he was arrested by Li Shiqun and his elderly mother and children were monitored, forcing him to join the puppet government. After considering for two months, he took on international intelligence, working as a translator of the English-language North China Daily News, and with the intention of saving the people in the occupied areas. Therefore, he said: "My betrayal is different from others. If I have done anything wrong to any Chinese, I am willing to be severely punished by the law and sentenced to death." As for his relationship with Gojima Shigeru, because his behavior did not seek high office or great wealth, Gojima admired him. Gojima believed in Buddhism and studied Mencius and Neo-Confucianism, and he knew him well. He was deeply influenced by him, so after he met him, he no longer killed a single person and always respected his opinions.</p>
<p>Sun Shaokang, from Jilin, 61 years old, wearing a gray silk long shirt, with a bald head and white hair, held a palm leaf fan in his hand. Before the hearing was over, he loudly said that he could not bear it and asked the court to give him tea so that he could take Rendan. The judge granted his request. According to Sun's confession: he was originally Dai Li's legal advisor. After Shanghai fell, Dai sent him to Shanghai to rescue underground comrades and began to take office in the puppet government. As for the reason for leaving office, it was because the concession had completely fallen and he could no longer do relief work, and his mother had passed away, so he was sad and left.</p>
<p>Cao Yaoting, a puppet prosecutor, Shen Xiaoyan, a puppet reporter, Shen Weiting, chairman of the puppet China Tobacco Company, and Zhang Bingheng and others were also questioned once. The above cases have been ordered to be retried at a later date.</p>

<h3>Workers May Not Stop Work Without Permission Except on Holidays</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Ordered Compliance to Emphasize Production</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau stated that workers in various factories in this city occasionally take days off and stop work without authorization other than on prescribed holidays, resulting in wage and other disputes. Therefore, it issued a notice to all industry trade unions and industry associations yesterday, saying: "The dates for factory holidays are clearly stipulated by law. All non-holidays and government-prescribed holidays must not be stopped to emphasize production. If workers stop work without authorization outside of the prescribed dates, it will be regarded as absenteeism, and no wages will be paid, and factories are allowed to handle it in accordance with factory regulations. In addition to distributing it separately, it is hereby ordered that the trade unions (associations) comply with it and order all members to comply without fail."</p>
<h3>Relief for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu: All Circles Respond, 200 Million Disbursed as Raised</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association hosted the local press at the Pudong Association yesterday. Wu Kaixian, deputy chairman of the association, Wang Xianqing, general secretary, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Mr. Wu Kaixian reported that the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu is a difficult task. It is estimated that the number of refugees is as high as 3 million. They are displaced and lack food and clothing. Among them, millions are in dire need of relief without the help of relatives and friends. They are now scattered in Xuzhou, Haizhou, Tongzhou, Taixian, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and this city. Zhenjiang has the most, about 200,000 people. Twenty-seven reception centers have been established. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the 行总 are providing relief, but the amount is very small. In the past two months, they have received relief, but each month can only get a bag of flour, which is not as abundant as what unemployed workers in Shanghai receive. In addition to the young refugees, who have youth training classes for training and job placement, women, children, and the elderly are about to become starved corpses. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee, has vowed to raise 2 billion yuan from July 1 to August 31, disbursing to Zhenjiang as the funds are raised, because disaster relief is like putting out a fire, and no delay is allowed.</p>
<p>The current work situation is roughly as follows: (1) Mr. Du Yuesheng has first borrowed 500 million from 14 banks in the city without interest, which will be remitted within one or two days. (2) Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xingyan, and myself have invited famous actors and performers to perform for charity for ten days, and they have all expressed their willingness to do so. The location has been set at the Tianchan Stage. (3) Within this week, the city's radio stations will also join the fundraising efforts. (4) In addition to the above-mentioned groups, employees and dancers in all dance halls in the city have also voluntarily contributed, planning to donate all of their income for one day, without deducting expenses, to benefit the disaster victims. Speaking to this point, Director Wu said in a humorous tone: "I never dance, but I hope everyone will go dancing more on this day and eat more things. You must know that if they don't eat, the refugees will have nothing to eat; if they don't dance, the refugees will jump into the river!" Wu Zhilao has agreed to write to the mayor, asking the municipal government to also exempt the entertainment tax for the dance halls on that day, so that more disaster victims can benefit.</p>
<p>The association has now established eight fundraising teams, with sub-teams under them, without a limit on the number, and is in the process of organizing. It has also commissioned six banks, including Jin Cheng, Jiao Tong, Jiangsu, Xinhua, Jiangsu Farmers, and China General Chamber of Commerce, to receive donations. All generous benefactors can go directly to these six banks to make payments. In the future, all donations will be swept to Zhenjiang by these six banks. All office expenses in Shanghai will be paid by the organizers, and no donations will be used. Later, Wang Xianqing expressed his gratitude, briefly mentioning the motivation for fundraising, which is entirely due to the humanitarian and universal spirit of mutual assistance, and he deeply believes that results will be achieved soon. At this point, the meeting was adjourned in the midst of a gale and heavy rain.</p>
<h3>Major Thunderstorm in the City</h3>
<p>Inducing Citizens' Unfounded Speculation: Suspicions Linked to Atomic Bomb Tests</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the weather in the city was gloomy and cool, turning warmer after 10 AM, and becoming even more intense by 3 PM. Soon after, dark clouds rose abruptly from the east, followed by a sudden downpour with gale-force winds, accompanied by lightning and thunder. This lasted for an hour before subsiding. At 6:30 PM in the evening, thunderstorms returned with renewed intensity. As yesterday coincided with the scheduled atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll, it heightened the sensitivity of some citizens, who speculated that the sudden and violent weather was related to the bomb, a notion that can be described as wildly imaginative.</p>
<h3>Naked Body with Knife Wounds Discovered in Pudong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a male corpse, estimated to be in his twenties or thirties, was discovered in a deserted grave south of Mengjiazhai Bridge in Yangjing Town, Pudong. The body was completely naked and had several knife wounds on the chest. The Yangjing Sub-bureau has since apprehended a suspect, surnamed Wu, who is currently under interrogation.</p>
<h3>Car Accident Log</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11:30 AM, an elderly woman was killed by a car at Sikazi Bridge on Yalu Road. Also, at 8:10 PM last night, a military truck collided with a tram at the intersection of Avenue Road and Xiaoshadu Road. Two National Army soldiers on the truck, Sheng Jifu and Lu Fenghe, sustained head and brain injuries respectively, and were sent to the Civilian Hospital.</p>

<h3>Zhan Shi No. 3 Middle School Continues to Operate; Classes to be Held in the Town Next Semester</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The National Third Wartime Middle School was originally located in Yushan, Jiangxi. After the restoration, the school was ordered to disperse students in the recovered areas to public and private middle schools in various provinces, with each student receiving 10,000 yuan for travel expenses. However, because many of the school's students are still in the communist-controlled area, if it were to be closed down, these students would be difficult to receive family support and would inevitably drop out of school. The Ministry of Education has now ordered the school to temporarily suspend its closure and to relocate from Yushan to Zhenjiang. The school has sent personnel to Zhenjiang to survey the school site, and classes will begin in the town next semester. (Zhen)</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>On the Position of District Offices and the Authority of District Chiefs</h3>
<p>—Zhang Xiaosong</p>
<p>Currently, some people believe that with the establishment of police bureau branches, the establishment of district offices is redundant and unnecessary. The police bureau can handle the organization and guidance of Baojia, and the investigation and management of household registration. Others argue that the merging of false and Baoding (I'm not sure about how to translate 保合一 so this remains as it is) has made Baojia and the police integrated, becoming a complete police governance, with the police managing the autonomous institutions, which is not in line with the purpose of local autonomy. Therefore, district praises are needed, but district offices can only be considered as units for handling Baojia and relocation matters. If the district offices are to handle both Baojia and election matters, while also handling administrative affairs, it would conflict with the administrative system and authority of various bureaus.</p>
<p>The above two views are wrong. We need to make everyone understand the position of the district offices and the authority of the district chiefs. Without much citation or theoretical discussion, we can understand by studying the municipal organizational law.</p>
<p>Article 6 of the municipal organizational law: "Below the city is the district, and the organization within the district is Baojia…" This clearly explains the position of the district, which constitutes the municipal organization and occupies a position between the municipal government and Baojia.</p>
<p>Article 34 of the municipal organizational law states: "Each district shall have a district praise, with one district chief and one deputy district chief, elected by the district people's representative assembly, under the supervision and direction of the municipal government, to handle autonomous matters in the district and execute matters delegated by the municipal government." This explains the authority of the district chief, who is under the supervision and direction of the municipal government, handling autonomous matters in the district and executing matters delegated by the municipal government.</p>
<p>Due to the explicit provisions of Article 11 of the municipal organizational law, the district office is an institution that forms the city and is located between the municipal government and Baojia, which is different from the branches of the police bureau. Article 34 also clearly stipulates the authority of the district chief. The establishment of the district office is not only free from the unnecessary redundancy, but is also an important institution for handling local autonomy and executing municipal government orders, proving that it is not simply an agency for handling elections.</p>
<p>We believe that the work of the municipal government, aiming at all benefits and the elimination of malpractices, is for the citizens. The organization of citizens is Baojia, and the local autonomy The public opinion organization at the level is the Bao Min assembly. In the district, there is also a district people's congress, and the district chief is generated through the election of the district people's congress. On the one hand, he is responsible to the district people's congress, and at the same time, he must guide the autonomous business of Baojia throughout the district. Therefore, all matters that are beneficial to citizens, after being resolved by the Bao Min Assembly and the District People's Congress, as long as they do not conflict with the central and municipal laws and regulations, he has the obligation to enforce.</p>
<p>One more point to be explained is that when the district office accepts the resolutions of the district people's congress, or accepts the suggestions of the Bao Min assembly and Baojia chiefs, and handles autonomous affairs, if it involves hygiene, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Hygiene; if it involves land administration, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Land Administration; if it involves public works, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Public Works; if it involves social welfare, it should of course be reported to the Bureau of Social Affairs. The same can be inferred for the rest of the bureaus. According to their authority, the various bureaus of the municipal government have the authority to direct and supervise the handling of all matters, unless they believe that it is unnecessary or conflicts with laws and regulations, in which case they will not approve or order amendments. So, what is the conflict?</p>
<p>Standing in the position of civil servants, in the current democratic era, we should consider for ourselves what political efficiency we have achieved in the past when our government monopolized politics and did not allow the people to do things. We believe that the power of the people is infinite. We believe that the people can handle autonomous matters and matters that are closely related to their own interests quickly and well, as long as we supervise and direct them. Why not allow them to do it themselves?</p>
<h3>District People's Representative Assemblies to be Convened by the 5th of this Month</h3>
<p>The district people's representatives of this city were elected in April of this year. However, most of the elected representatives have not submitted their public service inspections, which has prevented the convening of the establishment meeting. It is learned that in order to actively establish grassroots democracy and ensure the smooth implementation of local autonomy, the municipal government has ordered all district offices to convene the district people's representative establishment meeting before July 5th of this year, elect the chairman of the representative assembly, and continue to convene the first representative meeting to discuss matters that should be improved in various districts.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Requisition of Field Tax and Food; Registration to be Opened in Various Districts on Schedule</h3>
<p>According to Article 3 of the Measures for the Requisition of Field Tax in Kind, the field tax and food requisitioned by the enemy and puppets in the restored area during the period of enemy occupation should be allowed to be registered by the people with the same tax payment certificate, so as to clear the price against the enemy. This city stipulates that the registration period is from July 15th to September 15th, two months. In the 14th, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 29th, 30th, 31st, and 9th districts, the Baojia will issue registration forms in triplicate. The grain households will fill out the registration forms and submit them to the Baojia, who will forward them to the Finance Bureau for registration. Grain households in other districts will apply to the Finance Bureau for registration during the registration period. The Civil Affairs Office has sent letters to the praise in various districts yesterday, urging them to handle it seriously.</p>
<h3>Eighteenth District Election Lawsuit - Wei Yu-nong Loses</h3>
<p>In the city's 18th district's election for a senator, Wei Yu-nong, the third alternate senator elected in that district, sued the district office for election irregularities and fraud. The case was heard by the Shanghai District Court, regarding election ballots. Yesterday, the court pronounced its judgment, dismissing Wei Yu-nong's lawsuit. The plaintiff shall bear the litigation costs.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Department, a total of eight election lawsuits arose from this city councilor election. Except for two cases withdrawn by the plaintiffs, the remaining six cases have been adjudicated by the Shanghai District Court. The entire election has been determined to be valid. Once the Ministry of the Interior approves the public notice to the city, the inaugural meeting can be convened.</p>
<h3>Death of Weng Jian-guang</h3>
<p>Weng Jian-guang, the elected councilor for the city's 12th district (Jiangmi District), passed away at the age of 33. Originally from Ningbo, Zhejiang, he graduated from Guanghua University and successively served as Director of the Political Department of the Army and Chief Secretary of the National Reserve Army General Headquarters. He was the current Chairman of Jingxin Glass Factory and General Manager of Jianda Timber Firm. He passed away due to illness at 5:00 AM on the 28th of last month. Upon hearing the news, various parties expressed their condolences. His seat as a city councilor will be filled by Shao Yong-sheng from the same district, according to law.</p>
<h3>Ninth District Implementing Comprehensive Cleaning</h3>
<p>The city's ninth district, located in the western suburbs, is inferior to other districts in terms of environmental hygiene. With the recent outbreak of epidemics, District Head Yao, in order to encourage residents to pay attention to hygiene and prevent the spread of disease, has specifically scheduled a district-wide cleaning campaign on the 2nd of this month. At that time, in addition to the full mobilization of Baojia (neighborhood administrative unit) personnel for supervision, letters will also be sent to the police precinct, health center, and cleaning team to assist in the persuasion efforts.</p>
<h3>Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Household Registration Law (II)</h3>
<p>(Article 8) To carry out household surveys, the provincial government, or the county government under the order of the provincial government, should set a survey date. Before the start of the household survey, Baojia (neighborhood administrative units) should be organized. Counties that have already organized Baojia may reorganize Baojia during the household survey. However, once the Bao system is determined, it cannot be changed without the approval of the provincial government. The organization or reorganization of Baojia should be completed ten days before the survey date.</p>
<p>(Article 9) The Baojia organization is based on households. Ten households form a Jia, and ten Jia form a Bao. When there is a need for increase or decrease, a Jia can consist of six to fifteen households, and a Bao can consist of six to fifteen Jia.</p>
<p>In cities, a Jia consists of ten to thirty households, and a Bao consists of ten to thirty Jia.</p>

<h3>Solving the Food Problem for Shanghai Citizens - Ministry of Food to Allocate 50,000 Shi First - Foreign Rice Orders Expected to Arrive Within the Month - 70,000 Bags of Brazilian Rice Imported This Morning</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The "Azalea City" managed by Wah Lun Foreign Firm, transporting a large quantity of rice, 73,019 bags from Brazil, 24,601 bags of flour, 4,602 bales of cotton. These items are from the Relief Agency. Commercial cotton amounts to 8,286 bales, over 1,000 copper plates, and 400 boxes of coffee. Over 70,000 bags of rice were originally scheduled to be unloaded in Kowloon, but now changed to be unloaded in this city. The ship was scheduled to arrive yesterday and dock at the Blue Funnel Wharf. However, it had not arrived by 1 PM. According to the firm, if it could not arrive yesterday, it would definitely arrive this morning.</p>
<p>After the price of rice in this city was determined by the free authorities, the market immediately showed signs of both explicit and implicit tightening. Illegal activities are emerging endlessly. Merchants are using the excuse of high purchase prices and lack of profit, leading to the stalling of the procurement and transportation work. Rice shops are also using the excuse of difficulty in obtaining spot goods, and arbitrarily suspending sales. President Song, Minister Xu, and Mayor Wu, among others, have been meeting for several days and have already worked out concrete measures. The Ministry of Food will allocate 50,000 dan, of which 1,700 tons (approximately 17,000 large bags) is Jiangxi rice, which was loaded onto ships a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai. In addition, of the foreign rice shipped from Annam to Shanghai last time, apart from some that has been transported to Huaguang, there are still 7,000 large bags, which have also been allocated to supplement. The remaining 20,000 dan will be allocated separately by the Ministry of Food. The rice previously ordered by the Ministry of Food from foreign countries is also expected to arrive within the month, at which time it will be re-distributed. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, Minister Xu and Lu Zuofu, the manager of Minsheng Shipping Company, also discussed ways to strengthen the transport of Sichuan rice to Shanghai, and concrete decisions were made.</p>

<p>Jinan and Yantai's handicraft industries have always been developed. Products like hairnets, yarn, flower cushions are all produced in these two places. Before the war, they also occupied an important position in exports. After the war, because these two places were occupied by the Communist army, workers fled, resulting in a decline in production. It is reported that domestic hairnets were in short supply a month ago. Only last week, a certain foreign firm shipped 5,000 luo, each luo containing 144 pieces. Although there is a large demand abroad for yarn flower cushions, the price limit set by American merchants is far from the domestic cost, so very few are exported.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Eased Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market eased because it was reported that medium sugar had arrived. And silver and grain were tight. Sentiment turned. The association's quota was slightly lower than the weekend by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The market was stable at the beginning, and eventually loosened. The opening price was $116,000, once down to $117,000 to $118,000, then to $114,000. The total fall was over $5,000. Road goods were $100,700 to $102,000, down $7,000. The fifth-period building orders were $114,000 to $112,500, then to $110,000, down $7,000. Raw sugar was $106,000. Numbered goods, the old leader helped to open hundreds of packages of ice-flower-white, at $137,000 to $133,000. More than a hundred packages of cotton-red were $124,000-$125,000. There were no big fluctutations. Dozens of packages of Huanggang green were at $100,000, down $2,000. Forty [measurement unclear] of second-grade ice sugar were at $145,000.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Company Revises Regulations - Delivery Limited to 10 Days</h3>
<p>Also reported, according to the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, Taiwan sugar will arrive today and tomorrow. In the future, the allocated quantity is limited. The regulations stipulate that customers must pick up the goods within 10 days. Overdue is invalid. The previous regulation that customers only need to pay warehousing and insurance fees without time limits for previous customers holding warehouse receipts has been abolished to avoid hoarding.</p>
<h3>Lack of Funds and Fertilizers - Taiwan Sugar Production Sharply Reduced - Conversations with the Sichuan-Kang Delegation After the Investigation</h3>
<p>Over ten representatives of the National Assembly from Sichuan and Guangxi provinces, including Lu Chao, Leng Pu-ke, Ping Tie-fu, Chuan Chang, and Li [missing character], etc., organized a Taiwan inspection group after attending the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly in Beijing. They went to Taiwan for inspection in early June, paying particular attention to Taiwan's economic situation. The group has now returned to Beijing. According to Li Tie-tian, who came to Shanghai, Taiwan was under enemy rule and economic undertakings were controlled by the enemy. The Japanese regarded Taiwan as their industrial warehouse, spending large sums of money each year on sugar production and providing fertilizers, etc. After the war, Taiwan's sugar industry faced problems with capital and fertilizers, resulting in a sharp decline in production. The delegation has reported the findings to the government and suggested that the Taiwanese manufacturing machines be transferred in batches to Guangzhou and Sichuan for continued production.</p>
<h3>Shanghai American Businesses are Doing Well</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 29th Special Dispatch] Ford, Chairman of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Committee, issued a statement today, saying that although China's political and economic situation has not been resolved and foreign exchange controls are strict, American businesses are still able to transact with China in various ways. The businesses of 100 American companies with branches or representatives in Shanghai in the past few months are all reporting that they are doing well. Ford said: "The current unrest in China is the main reason why trade cannot be restored to the same extent as port trade." The Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Committee hopes that after China's economic recovery, Sino-American trade will be a fair trade for both parties.</p>
<h3>Longkou Vermicelli Rises Again</h3>
<p>The Longkou vermicelli market remains active due to continued consumption and limited arrivals. Therefore, market prices have risen repeatedly without easing. The current asking price for Longkou vermicelli in the market has reached $190,000. The trade [missing character] is rising as well.</p>
<h3>Post-Victory Shipping Statistics - Vessel Capacity Increasing Monthly</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, since the bureau's restoration last October until recently, the number of vessels entering and leaving the port of this city and the actual volume of transportation has increased monthly.

<h3>British Five Measures to Prevent Inflation</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 30th] The British government is preparing to take five steps to curb inflation. But this requires the traditional patience of the British people to avoid any sudden economic turmoil. The government's plan includes: levying heavy taxes, compiling prices, quantitative rationing, conservation movements, and trying to increase production. British clothing, automobiles, train tickets, and freight rates are increasing with time. According to the "Economist" weekly, "The crisis of inflation is more serious now than at any time in the past six years."</p>
<h3>This Year's Peiping City Cost of Living Index</h3>

<h3>Handling the Atomic Bomb Problem is the Best Test of Human Wisdom</h3>
<p>— ...Translated by this newspaper...</p>
<p>The invention of the atomic bomb has placed humanity at a historical crossroads: One path can lead to greater prosperity, progress, a further increase in living standards, and closer relations between nations, leaping from the current world to a world of atomic energy; the other path can lead to deeper taboos, hatred, collective destruction of life, universal suffering of culture, and allowing what humans have invented to kill humans. Which path will we take? This depends on human wisdom to decide.</p>
<p>The current question is how should humans handle the atomic bomb? How should we deal with the global situation created by the invention of the atomic bomb? Combining reports from various parties, the proposition that the United Nations organization should control atomic energy has become the most prevalent idea today. Scientists who invented the atomic bomb are particularly active about controlling the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of international control of atomic energy, there are currently two basic hypotheses: (1) All countries must allow inspectors from the United Nations organization to freely enter their territories, without any restrictions; (2) The production and use of radioactive elements in various countries must be monopolized by the government. Therefore, inspectors from the United Nations organization can concentrate their attention and do not have to be distracted in all aspects.</p>
<p>But whether countries around the world are willing to comply is indeed a big problem. For example, can the Soviet Union allow United Nations inspectors to enter its territory without restrictions? Is the United States willing to restrict the production of radioactive elements and not use them in civil industries to improve people's living standards? In fact, it is not only the United States and the Soviet Union that are like this, many other countries are the same. Therefore, it is still quite far from achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if countries agree to international control of atomic energy, can it avoid atomic bomb wars in this generation or the next generation? The answer is also no. Because the so-called control is only to supervise governments not to manufacture atomic bombs or other atomic weapons, and to use atomic energy for industrial purposes or conduct research in laboratories, which is still possible. According to scientists, the technology for manufacturing radioactive materials is neither secret nor difficult. In the next ten years, at least eight or ten countries can produce radioactive materials. Suppose that in ten or fifteen years, there are already atomic energy factories in some countries around the world. These factories are either under international control or supervised by United Nations organizations, guaranteeing that the radioactive materials produced therein are indeed used to generate energy and never to produce atomic bombs. Suppose again that all countries do not have atomic bombs and still maintain aircraft, rockets, navies, bombs, and standing armies. But because the fundamental problems of international politics have not been resolved, the situation can still worsen, reaching the point of armed conflict. Once the war starts, all international controls will naturally collapse immediately. In this case, countries can use the knowledge about atomic energy previously obtained in factories and laboratories to immediately start manufacturing atomic bombs and can achieve this in a few months at most. Therefore, even if international control of atomic energy is completely successful, it is only a delaying tactic, not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>So, is there no hope of avoiding atomic war in this generation or the next generation? The answer is that there is very little hope. Humanity's ability to produce destructive tools has completely exceeded its ability to create political control tools, resembling the tortoise and the hare in a race.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent future wars is that, in addition to international control of atomic energy, the United Nations organization must possess weapons that general countries do not have and cannot manufacture, including atomic bombs. Once an act of aggression occurs in the world, no matter its nature, the United Nations organization must immediately have the power to stop it. If the United Nations organization is to truly play a role, then the veto power of individual countries must also be abolished, so that the Security Council can take swift and effective action. In other words, on the one hand, there must be a world government with real power, and on the other hand, countries must implement disarmament under supervision.</p>
<p>Humanity must open the door to progress. How to handle the atomic bomb problem is indeed the best test of human wisdom. The future destiny of the world is not determined by the gods, but by the minds of humans. (Excerpted and translated from "Harper's" magazine)</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Atomic Bomb Test</h3>
<p>— …Materials Office of this Newspaper…</p>
<p>In order to determine the explosive power of the atomic bomb and its impact on the Navy, the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force originally scheduled to jointly conduct a test of the atomic bombing of warships in Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean on the 15th of [missing character] month. Later, in order to facilitate more members of Congress to visit (this is the explanation of White House Press Secretary Rose), the date was extended to July 1 near the Bikini Atoll. The island is about 21 miles long and reportedly about 11 miles wide. The island has only 167 indigenous people. After a vote, they were willing to [missing character] Longiriec Island, 135 miles east, and evacuation began in late February.</p>
<p>The procedure for the atomic bomb test is prescribed as follows: The first bomb will explode several hundred feet above the parked [Japanese missing character] ship. The second bomb will explode at sea level, and it is expected that it will raise a tidal wave as high as 100 feet, causing the greatest damage. The third bomb will explode several thousand feet underwater, and the pressure will cause the hull to implode.</p>
<p>The B-29 Flying Fortress from the US 509th Mixed Air Group will participate in the test. These aircraft are unmanned and will take off, hover, and land by themselves using radio control. The warships, battleships, destroyers, cruisers, transports, landing craft, and submarines prepared to be attacked during the test also include the German cruiser "Prinz Eugen" and the Japanese battleship "Nagato." Of course, there are no humans on the ships, but various weapons such as aircraft, artillery, tanks, mobile radar, and radio equipment are placed, and in order to test the effect of the atomic bomb on organisms, animals such as pigs, rats, cattle, and sheep will be loaded to replace living people. At the same time, automatic recording robots will be placed on the coral island to make various measurements.</p>
<p>Only the representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission of the United Nations organization are allowed to visit the atomic bomb test. The representatives of the association include China, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Canada, Australia, Egypt, the Netherlands, and Mexico in addition to the United States. About 200 reporters are allowed to visit on ships [missing character] 8 to 10 miles away. About 150 warships are watching around. During the test, representatives of several major news organizations in the United States will use [missing character] radio and photography to quickly spread the entire process of the test to the world.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Test Photography</h3>
<p>Yesterday's atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific may become the best-documented scientific experiment in many years. The atomic bomb explosion will be photographed from various angles with remote-controlled and long-range cameras, including photographs and radar images. Some will be taken from airplanes, and some from fixed points. Radio-controlled cameras are placed on 100-foot-high towers, these towers are strong enough to withstand the force of the wind caused by the atomic bomb explosion. They will not be placed farther than five to ten miles from ground zero. The cameras are placed in houses with thick lead walls, and each camera is placed in a sealed and waterproof box. The photography is done through window openings, which will automatically close after the explosion to prevent radiation from affecting the film.</p>
<p>The cameras need special protective devices to withstand the extremely high heat emitted by the atomic bomb explosion. A thin film will be placed on the lens of the camera. Due to the effect of light, this film will be removed after the flash of the explosion. The reason for this film is likely because the heat from the explosion would pass through the lens, causing the unexposed film to melt due to reaching its flash point.</p>
<p>The results of the photographic recordings will not be known for several weeks after the experiment, as radiation prevents people from approaching the camera towers. Photographs taken by what are called Fairchild Radar Cameras can be obtained earlier, as they are taken from remotely controlled aircraft or from ordinary aircraft at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

<h3>Humor Regarding the Atomic Bomb Test</h3>
<p>— …Compiled by this newspaper's editorial department…</p>
<p>Remember the Bible's "Genesis," which says that during the ancient flood, Noah and his wife received divine inspiration, ordering them to take a pair of each kind of bird and beast to avoid disaster on the Ark, waiting for the small island to have grass before returning the boat, so the flood could recede. The result was miraculously fulfilled, and various animals were able to survive in the world. (See picture above)</p>
<p>In the atomic bomb test, animals such as pigs, rats, rabbits, and sheep were placed on the "target ship," as stand-ins for humans. (See picture below)</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the first test atomic bomb exploded, and the pigs, rats, rabbits, and sheep may have all perished.</p>
<p>This painting is a recent work by an English marine painter, titled "Progress?" A comparison of the past and present is thought-provoking. (Reported by The New York Times)</p>
<h3>Revisiting the Old Atomic Bomb Case</h3>
<p>— Compiled by this newspaper's research department</p>
<p>Hiroshima Attacked</p>
<p>On August 5th of last year, U.S. Army Colonel Tibbets piloted a B-29 Flying Fortress and dropped the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Japan, using a parachute, producing a world-shocking effect. The pillar shot straight into the sky, reaching a height of 20,000 feet. According to President Truman's report, the bomb's destructive power exceeded 20,000 tons of TNT explosives.</p>
<p>Nagasaki Suffers</p>
<p>In the early morning of August 9th, another B-29 Superfortress dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. According to the description of British Air Force Group Captain Cheshire, who witnessed the scene at the time, when the bomb exploded, he only felt that the observation plane he was on suddenly received a violent impact, and at the same time felt that the world outside the aircraft body was illuminated extraordinarily. When he looked out, he only saw a terrifying large fireball, estimated to have a temperature of 10 million degrees Celsius, followed by a huge gray smoke pillar, pushing the fireball straight into the sky, about 5,000 feet above the ground. Within the fire column, intense flames rotated and soared, continuously spewing fire. The fireball and smoke column continued to rise and spew fire until, two minutes later, it had reached a height of 20,000 feet. The fireball at the top of the column had turned into a transparent sulfur color, and the black smoke at the bottom of the smoke column spread in all directions, mixing with the dust from the affected ground. At this time, a vast area of ground was ablaze with raging fire, quickly spreading. Twenty minutes after the explosion, the smoke and fire column had risen to a height of 60,000 feet, its shape gradually resembling a huge cloud. The entire Nagasaki below was destroyed in smoke and fire.</p>
<p>The Tragic Scene After the Bombing</p>
<p>Hiroshima after the bombing had become a desolate wasteland of scorched earth, with no green grass growing, and tree trunks resembling coke. Within two miles of the atomic bomb's detonation point, various vehicles were blasted and thrown more than a thousand feet above the ground before crashing back down, becoming heaps of scrap. Because Nagasaki had small by dividing the city, the damage was less severe than in Hiroshima. Within the bombed area, the copper and iron wreckage of factories lay scattered and piled up in a mess.</p>
<p>Atomic Ailments</p>
<p>Furthermore, residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were bombed by atomic bombs, although not dying immediately, often died several weeks later. According to experts' reports: the majority of residents were exposed to radium-like rays from the atomic bomb explosion, penetrating deep into the blood vessel tissues in the bone marrow, disrupting all blood functions. The blood could no longer clot, white blood cells disappeared, bacteria ran rampant, and the afflicted eventually died within two or three weeks. In addition, many people contracted so-called "atomic disease," with strange ailments such as hair loss, tooth loss, burns, nerve disorders, gynecological problems, purpura, and massive bleeding. The strangest thing was that some women with irregular menstruation were treated by the atomic bomb blast.</p>
<h3>One Wave Subsides, Another Rises! The Yu Zhaoqi Case Occurs in Hong Kong, Our Country's Law Encounters a New Trial</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong Airmail, June 29th, Special Correspondent Lin Youlan</p>
<p>The laws of one country are naturally different from the laws of another country, and there is a great distance between the laws of one country and the laws of another country's colony, which is inevitably the case. Therefore, both sides must understand each other, respect each other, and strive for the "same" amidst the "different." Neither side should stubbornly hold onto "going its own way," using the rule of law in name while "breaking the law" in practice, or even intentionally protecting figures who harm the other side's sovereignty or create events that harm the other side's sovereignty. Only then can a path to cooperation be found and mutual friendship enhanced. Since Generalissimo Chiang, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the China Theater, ordered British Navy Rear Admiral Harcourt to represent him in accepting the surrender of the Japanese forces in Hong Kong, the situation in Hong Kong has undergone a new transformation. However, some British officials who returned to Hong Kong disregarded the current reality and remained fixated on their old tricks of ruling the colony, seeming to feel unconcealed jealousy towards our country's new status in Hong Kong. It has often been heard that the Hong Kong government authorities and our military and political personnel stationed in Hong Kong have directly experienced friction, indirectly creating a negative impact on Sino-British relations, especially the recent incident in which the Kuomintang Daily was ordered to cease publication, which was the most significant. This reporter has made a detailed report on the ins and outs of the incident, which is believed to be known to people in the country. Now, less than two days after enlightened figures in the Hong Kong government, in order to cherish Sino-British friendship, partially lifted the ban on the Kuomintang Daily, another "Yu Zhaoqi incident" occurred. Let me tell my compatriots who are concerned about the Hong Kong issue about what happened:</p>
<h3>To Maintain Military Discipline, the Guangdong Headquarters Orders the Arrest of Yu Zhaoqi</h3>
<p>On the 26th, this newspaper and major newspapers published a message stating: "Military Affairs Commission Councilor Yu Zhaoqi, in his capacity as a soldier, engaged in commercial activities in Hong Kong, violating army regulations. Upon receiving the report, Director Zhang of the Guangzhou Headquarters, in order to maintain military discipline, specially telegraphed Major General Guo Naqi, the Special Inspector stationed in Hong Kong and Kowloon, to escort him to Guangdong for investigation." After receiving the order, how did Major General Guo handle it? According to Major General Guo's statement to the Kuomintang Daily reporter who visited him on the 28th:</p>
<p>"I (Guo referred to himself) received a telegram from Director Zhang on the 23rd of this month, ordering me to immediately arrest Yu Zhaoqi and send him to the province for interrogation. I immediately executed the order, notifying Mr. Yu to visit my residence on the same day. Mr. Yu arrived as scheduled, and I informed Mr. Yu that Director Zhang had telegraphed, ordering him to go to the province to await orders. After hearing this, he immediately took the telegram to read, and after reading it, he asked me how I would handle the matter. I told him to take the Xian Wheel to the province on the next day (i.e., the 24th). He agreed at the time, but said that he had unfinished private matters in Hong Kong and asked to be allowed to cross over to Hong Kong once. I immediately ordered the commander of the Kowloon Gendarmerie Company to monitor his actions. Unexpectedly, after he returned to his bedroom at the Peninsula Hotel from Hong Kong, there were British military police patrolling and guarding outside his bedroom, and he was strictly ordered not to go to the province for the time being. Upon hearing the news, I told the British military police that this was a matter of our military discipline and should be monitored by our military police. Both our military police and the British military police guarded outside Mr. Yu's door. Before long, the British military police captain apologized to me, saying that this was an order from above to guard Mr. Yu. At around 3:00 a.m. that night, just as I was falling asleep, General Festing, the commander of the British Army, sent a special boat to pick me up, saying that there was an important matter to discuss. I crossed the sea to the British Army Headquarters. In addition to General Festing, the Hong Kong Auxiliary Secretary McDonald and a Westerner were present. They talked to me about Yu Zhaoqi's matter, saying that Mr. Yu had now resigned and was an ordinary civilian, so extradition methods should be used. They also took out Mr. Yu's letter of dismissal from March of this year as proof. I immediately explained our country's army system, which is divided into two types: 'official' and 'position'. 'Position' can be temporarily transferred or dismissed, while 'official' belongs to the rank of officer and is permanent in nature. Unless the officer's rank is revoked due to some reason or he has been ordered to retire, he is still a soldier of our country. At that time, the two sides studied and argued until 4:00 a.m. I, being unclear about the key point, raised an opinion regarding the responsibility for guarding Mr. Yu in order to clarify responsibilities. At that time, General Festing requested that the British side guard him. I had no preconceived notions about which side should guard him, but the procedures must be clear and the responsibilities must be clear. General Festing then wrote a letter for the record to take responsibility. If our side requests an interrogation, the British side will be responsible for handing him over. After this consultation, I have already telegraphed Director Zhang for instructions."</p>
<p>According to the Hong Kong Telegraph, translated and published in the Hong Kong Business Daily on the 27th, under the headline "Disturbance at the Peninsula Hotel," the report stated the following regarding the process of Mr. Yu's arrest:</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu has recently been in Hong Kong for private matters. According to usually reliable reports, he was indeed arrested by Chinese military police on Monday afternoon, but he managed to escape and received the protection of the Hong Kong police. It is heard that he persuaded his captors to return with him to the Peninsula Hotel so that he could retrieve some clothing. At this point, Mr. Yu called the police."</p>
<p>"The first sign that the attempted arrest of Yu Zhaoqi had been discovered by ordinary people was when an armed Chinese military policeman entered the officers' club of the Peninsula Hotel on Monday evening and sat down just inside the entrance. Upon seeing an armed Chinese military policeman arrive, Mr. Yu returned to his room on the fourth floor, and an air force policeman was dispatched to guard him. Two people spent the night in Mr. Yu's room, while another person guarded the corridor outside the door."</p>
<h3>Yu is Proficient in English, Claiming He "Contributed to Britain" and Received a Medal</h3>
<p>What kind of person is Yu Zhaoqi exactly? The Ming Pao once recorded that "Mr. Yu grew up in Hong Kong. When the Japanese attacked Hong Kong, he worked for the British as a counter-fifth column and spy, making extremely significant contributions." He was awarded a medal for his contributions to Britain during the Burma campaign. Other famous newspapers have made brief records, but the most detailed information was in the New Life Evening Post on the 28th, which also pointed out that Mr. Yu had expressed his agreement with the British construction of the Ping Shan Airport. It also confirmed that Mr. Yu was not a native of Hong Kong. Mr. Yu had gone to England to study at a young age, etc. According to its full text:</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu is in his forties, strongly built, and neatly dressed. He often wears military uniforms in Hong Kong, with shining medals. He has a small mustache on his lips, neatly trimmed and clean, seeming dignified. He speaks boldly and is particularly proficient in English. Therefore, he interacts with Westerners and Europeans and has a close relationship with them. He is not bound by details and is not subject to popular opinions, which is particularly commendable as his characteristic."</p>
<p>"This spring, the Ping Shan Airport issue was attracting attention from both China and abroad, and the discussions were heated. Mr. Yu once gave a speech in the Overseas Chinese Daily, expressing his strong support for this move, believing that it would greatly benefit both China and Britain. He was also a figure often mentioned by reporters in public gatherings in this city."</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu lives on the fourth floor of the Peninsula Hotel. His wife went to England to study at the beginning of the year, while he often goes to the officers' club for recreation, and most of the people he associates with are prominent British military figures."...</p>
<h3>The Development of the Situation, Concerning Our Military Law and Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Because Mr. Yu and General Chen Ce once had that relationship, this reporter inquired about General Chen's friends in Hong Kong. According to them, Mr. Yu only served as General Chen's interpreter at the time. After Mr. Yu returned to the country, General Chen noticed that his "behavior was suspicious" and notified the Guangdong Provincial authorities to detain Mr. Yu in Qujiang. From then on, General Chen's relationship with Yu was cut off.</p>
<p>Since the Yu Zhaoqi incident occurred, all Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, except for the Overseas Chinese Daily run by the traitor Cen Weixiu, have published relevant news in prominent positions, but no one has commented or criticized it. However, the "Bird's Eye View" column in the newspaper on the 27th said: "There is a coming and going in things. I think, if British military police established headquarters (the original text adds an "S" to indicate the plural - reporter's note) everywhere in China to arrest people, what kind of reaction would there be?" Only this newspaper could say such "humor"! According to the Kuomintang Daily on the 28th, "Although Yu Zhaoqi left the Peninsula Hotel yesterday to come to Hong Kong for an hour, he was still guarded by the British military. Since our side has a letter of guarantee from the British side to be responsible for guarding Mr. Yu, we have withdrawn our military police who were monitoring Mr. Yu."</p>
<p>As of the time this reporter is writing, the army authorities in Hong Kong have not issued any statement on this incident. How the situation will develop is difficult to determine for the moment. In short, our country's military law and sovereignty in Hong Kong have encountered another trial!</p>

<p>Mild cases need one dose, severe cases will heal after two doses. Do not give Moutan Bark to pregnant women. (The additional flavor ingredient has been omitted)</p>
<p>(Dr. Chen Cunren's Commentary) Ye Tianshi was a native of Suzhou and a famous doctor of the Qing Dynasty. He lived to eighty years old and died. There are ten volumes of medical case studies, which were compiled by later generations. This recipe is not listed, but small booklets of verified remedies published at the end of the Qing Dynasty did list this recipe.</p>
<p>In general, the causes of toothache can be summarized into four categories: (1) Tooth decay pain; (2) Liver fire pain – that is, neuralgia; (3) Wind-fire pain – affected by external feelings; (4) Yin deficiency pain – that is, fatigue causing loose teeth and receding gums, or vitamin C deficiency. This recipe contains seven ingredients: calcined gypsum clears actual fire, Rehmannia root nourishes body fluids (i.e., increases vitamin C), Schizonepeta and Siler disperse wind and heat, Moutan bark clears blood heat, and green orange peel and licorice harmonize and detoxify. Its effect is roughly like this. The combination is appropriate, so it is quite effective. However, according to my observation, this recipe cannot treat all four types of toothache. Generally, this recipe is most effective for tooth decay pain, or even has no effect, so you must seek treatment from a dentist. It is also less effective for the second type, liver fire neuralgia, with only 4 out of 10 seeing results. It can indeed have miraculous effects on the third type, wind-fire toothache, with 9 out of 10 seeing results. It also has a considerable effect on the fourth type, yin deficiency pain, with 5 or 6 out of 10 seeing results. This recipe has been circulating for a long time, and it is no accident that it has become an effective remedy. However, it is not a universal cure for all toothaches, and this explanation has been provided above. (The original recipe also has additional external application methods, which use many drugs and have disadvantages, so they have been omitted.)</p>

<h3>Three Million Refugees from Northern Jiangsu Are Suffering After Losing Their Homes</h3>
<p>Inspire the Human Spirit of Universal Love and Mutual Aid to Donate What You Can</p>
<p>To the editor: The refugees in northern Jiangsu have suffered the enemy's invasion in recent years, and their wounds have not yet healed. On the day of victory and restoration, disaster struck again. Those with homes and families lost their homes and suffered, while those who were settled in their land have left their homes and turned their backs on their hometowns. They lack food and clothing, wander along the road, sleep in the wind and lodge in translation bureaus, and are in a miserable state! According to the survey statistics of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, the number of people is over three million. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has counted over 1,020,000 refugees who lack food and clothing. Feeling compassion for these refugees who have suffered such hardship, we extend our deepest sympathy in the spirit of human universal love and mutual aid. We intend to provide assistance with a feeling of wanting to relieve hunger and drowning. We have gathered eminent figures from all walks of life and social celebrities to form this association, raise donations, and help these wandering refugees. We have begun working at Room 323 on the third floor of the East [Missing Characters] Association. Having long admired [Your Newspaper] for upholding public opinion and serving society, we dare to ask you to widely publicize this and compete to raise funds. We are enclosing five donation booklets and hope you will check them. If there are donations, please collect them on our behalf and remit them to one of the following six banks: Xinhua, Jin Cheng, Jiao Tong, Jiangsu, China, and Jiangsu Farmers Bank. Your support for public welfare will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association.</p>

<h3>Under the Scorching Sun</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>I can truly perceive the spirited demeanor they possess, so full of resilience. Just like myself and other young friends, we have trekked through arduous paths toward victory for year after year. When a chance encounter allows us to clasp hands tightly on the street, and we are rendered speechless, unable to express our inner feelings, do we simply smile or even silently walk away from each other?</p>
<p>Often, we resort to cold detachment to avoid contact. A friend, writing from the distant rear, expressed that he sees people's faces more clearly. Once, he saw a classmate at the cinema entrance. He clearly recognized him, but due to a prior unreturned letter and the classmate's haughty demeanor, he dared not even greet him....</p>
<p>And now, I have finally encountered these two friends for the first time since our separation. I am aware they are engaged in a perilous undertaking, while I am building castles in the air with my endless daydreams. Envying others and doubting myself, I have felt deeply ashamed and pained pondering over this disparity in the past.</p>
<p>"Ah, who would have thought we'd run into you here! We were just asking about you!" he said. Even in their tense and turbulent lives, they haven't forgotten me. I genuinely regret that I couldn't utter those words first. — Wishing to understand a friend's current situation, but unwilling to inquire about their address; knowing their current situation brings peace of mind, but knowing their address compels writing a letter; oh, writing a letter, what could I possibly tell them!</p>
<p>But no matter what, I welcome them and rejoice in our happy reunion.</p>
<p>The fierce sun beats down upon us. The joyous laughter of friendship is a magnificent parasol. In this valley surrounded by mountains, we feel like we are rowing a boat, with sweat droplets like scattered water splashes stirred by the oars.</p>
<p>A white butterfly accompanies us on our journey along the roadside, fluttering ahead again and again. This delicate, pitiful little creature, is it actually racing us?</p>
<p>They have endless stories to tell: summer nights in Jiangnan, scenes of wind and snow, a tapestry of terror and courage, a life-and-death struggle. In a deep, wide, and boiling river of blood, I see them swimming across.</p>
<p>If I were able to wield my pen freely, I would write many moving stories. But because I cannot, I prefer to tell you! My friend obviously overestimates my abilities.</p>
<p>But even if I cannot, I am eager to hear it. I have already wasted a considerable amount of paper and time, and I certainly cannot abandon my pen in self-despair.</p>
<p>"Tell me, I hope to write it down."</p>
<p>This makes them hesitate. Where to begin? To recount a fragment from so many tearful life experiences in a short amount of time is a difficult task.</p>
<p>However, after a moment of thought, the friend walking on the left says:</p>
<p>"At that time, we were surrounded by the enemy. Our demolition squad was ordered to stay behind enemy lines, always seeking opportunities to strike at the enemy.</p>
<p>"This was a captured town; its fall was silent and secretive. The Japanese flag cast a dismal shadow on the town walls, and a maintenance committee was announced immediately.</p>
<p>"Initially, the enemy attempted to use our original town chamber of commerce president to perform their farce, but after searching through the hills and bamboo forests, they had to abandon this foolish dream. Wang Yaming, a dog cultivated by the enemy and the special service captain of the puppet army, was thrust onto the dark stage as the protagonist of a grotesque drama.</p>
<p>"We knew the name Wang Yaming, and we understood everything about his past. Before he was captured by the enemy, he was once a resourceful and courageous demolition expert. Tall, intelligent, and capable, he later became addicted to opium at only twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>"He wasn't entirely without conscience; he released over a dozen of our personnel from his hands. He even openly said: 'It's easy to give the Japanese a blow, very easy!'</p>
<p>"That time, I personally spoke with Wang Yaming. We often had to take such risks to accomplish a task.</p>
<p>"Originally, we wanted him to come out of the city, but he insisted that we send someone in… When I met Wang Yaming… I naturally disguised myself as a merchant… I asked him to dismiss the guards and explained my purpose. Suddenly, I saw his expression change: 'You don't need to say more!' From his demeanor, I knew he was pretending. He certainly wouldn't immediately defect, but he wouldn't kill me either. I said with sarcasm: 'It's too late to regret it now!'</p>
<p>"He pondered silently for a moment, unexpectedly stood up, and led me to his room.</p>
<p>"'Well? Don't make me wait too long here,' I said.</p>
<p>"But he became very polite, offering the best cigarettes and candies, and said: 'We need to discuss a secret plan.'</p>
<p>"At this point, I felt reassured, feeling that my mission had a good chance of success. Although this simple ancient city had fallen silently, it was an important stronghold for the enemy. There were over a hundred enemies in the city, and five or six hundred new recruits being trained. If the plan succeeded, that is, if the enemy's warehouse was blown up, the combat gains would be considerable.</p>
<p>"This city was seventy or eighty li away from the railway line. Normally, the enemy's supplies were transported by train and then by truck to a small ferry fifteen li from the city, then transported to the city by coolies and horses by the enemy in the city. This route was heavily guarded almost once a week. The wooden boxes containing gunpowder were all yellow. We thought of using these yellow wooden boxes. If we could load a time bomb into one of these boxes, mix it into the enemy warehouse, then it would be successful.</p>
<p>"So I said to Wang Yaming, the opportunity must not be missed. The enemy's supplies would surely arrive within these two days. The enemy's troops were advancing rapidly, sweeping away our mountain guerrillas. After much consideration, Wang Yaming agreed and set a time to deliver the time bomb.</p>
<p>"Just as I was preparing to leave, a report came in that a Chinese soldier had entered the city. I was quite alarmed. The enemy's intelligence was so powerful. Later, Wang Yaming helped me find a solution. He dressed me in a puppet army uniform and escorted me out of the city gate.</p>
<p>"After I returned, I started working. We planned to bury landmines on the training ground at the same time as the enemy warehouse exploded, in order to kill the enemy's new recruits. On the other hand, we also contacted a small number of friendly forces to feign an attack at dawn when the bomb exploded. If Wang Yaming defected at that time, the plan would be completely successful.</p>
<p>"Wang Yaming is hateful! This fellow only verbally agreed to us. The landmines exploded, killing or injuring thirty enemy soldiers, but there was no sound from the warehouse. Alas, I thought, if he still felt proud after becoming a traitor, it was impossible for him to rebel against his master!"</p>
<p>At this point, my friend stopped. The sun was still scorching, causing sweat to fill our cheeks, making it difficult to open our eyes when we looked up. One really should wear a wide-brimmed straw hat when walking in the summer.</p>
<p>"Is this story over?" I felt dissatisfied.</p>
<p>"It's over," my friend said. "The traitor's ending is always the same. Not long after this incident, Wang Yaming was killed by us. Wang Yaming had a beautiful younger sister who had an affair with the Japanese pacification team leader. The pacification team leader was a muddle-headed debauchee, and his sister was a demonic seed. One night, this pair of darlings was captured alive by another group of our comrades… As for that sister, perhaps he should tell the story."</p>
<p>With an even more legendary story shortening the road, we saw the spire of the town ahead. The sunlight was fading, and there was a gentle breeze. I happily looked at my two friends, their wind-beaten faces now reddened by today's scorching sun.</p>
<h3>Ode to a Humble Birth</h3>
<p>In a dilapidated village near the sea, a family of two who made a living by fishing, the husband suspended his fishing for a day because his wife gave birth to their first child today, relying on his strong body and a pair of black and thick hands toiling, replaced his wife to do the messy housework: washing rice, chopping wood, cooking, washing the child's diaper, and taking care of the wife's diet tea ...</p>
<p>The child maintained the tradition of his father, being both black and large, although the pair of hands were small, but also strong and round, often when he was born, he also cried a few original sounds, and the crying came especially loud, heavy, accompanied by the whistling of the waves, playing the overture of birth.</p>
<p>Three days after the child was born, without the deserved rest and recuperation, the wife climbed down from the bed, although she felt a little weak in spirit, the bottom of her face revealed a comforting expression, the husband's face also showed a proud smile from time to time, because their incense could be passed on, their simple and instinctive love became deeper.</p>
<p>The June sunshine painted a golden color on the sea, the splashing waves, impacting the rocky shore, the husband writing a bronze small boat on the sea cast his hope of the net, the wife was sitting under the eaves of the shade to mend the broken, sleeping peacefully, crimson cheeks, twitching lips, round face, reflecting the blue sea and blue sky and golden sunshine, constitute a beautiful and moving picture of life.</p>
<p>When the husband carried a bag of labor income - fresh and beating fish stepped on the way home, the wife saw clearly in the distant doorway, and was about to stand up, the child woke up and cried again, she had to pick him up, close to her own chest, and went forward to meet the tired husband. Although she could not help her husband, as usual, to carry the heavy linen bag decorated with fish on his back, however, when she approached her husband, the husband showed a smile on his sweaty face, and made a funny face to tease the ignorant child to laugh, put down the fish bag, enthusiastically picked him up from his wife's arms, high interest in the air, at this time, the sunshine was full of the child's face, the waves were being stirred by the strong wind, and a wave behind the head of the white flying flowers, fluttering past the front carbon A wave, set off the clear blue sky behind, symbolizing the beginning of a new life!</p>
<p>However, the storms of the world, after all, surpassed the waves of the sea, the devil's hand of sorrow often tormented the joy of life, their peaceful life was disturbed by ruthless unpredictable events; suddenly a gust of wind rolled up on the sea, storms agitated the waves, roaring and roaring, the rocky shore finally could not withstand the impact of the waves of ten thousand feet high and was destroyed, and the sea water then ran to the shore like a beast, their thatched cottage was washed away by the flood, the dilapidated fishing boat, fishing net and all the furniture were also silently buried in the water.</p>
<p>The husband carried two thin quilts of baggage, holding the sleeping hot child, the wife carried her personal clothing, and both began the exile journey, they fled to a strange village thousands of miles away, to rebuild a warm home!</p>
<p>They braved the wind and frost and the chaos of starvation, and finally arrived at a village more than fifty miles away from the sea, and turned to their only relative - the mother's home, her father had died in his early years, and now only a old mother was left, although there were still dozens of acres of fields, but because there were no children under her knees, she had to let it be barren in vain, so the young and strong couple inherited this piece of property, and from then on abandoned the fishing life and cultivated the desolate land for many years, and was able to be self-sufficient and live and work in peace and contentment. In their simple hearts, they would naturally find a truth, because they firmly believed that: there is always a way out.</p>
<p>The child grew up in a string of ignorant months, so much like his father, with the same robust voice and body, after his first birthday, his father named him "Haigen", indicating that this small life was born by the sea, while they still often yearned for the life by the sea so difficult, the sea waves also often tormented them, but finally could not obliterate their simple and solid love, and passed on from generation to generation, until forever and ever.</p>

<h3>Flying Together (72)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>To understand what kind of mindset Mrs. Mo harbored, Lihua, this time summoning her courage, broke through her long-standing habit of silence and questioned Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>"Mom, how much longer do I have to sing before I can stop?"</p>
<p>"Xiaohua, what do you mean by that?" Mrs. Mo was somewhat confused by Lihua's question, and she stared and said.</p>
<p>"I mean, when can I stop singing?" Lihua rephrased the question for clarification.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear! There's still a long way to go!" Mrs. Mo said with a smile, pulling Lihua's hand. "You're only three years old and have just begun to show a bit of promise. You have to sing until you're as famous as Mei Lanfang, until your mother and I don't have to worry about clothing and food. Then you can stop singing."</p>
<p>Lihua pondered in her heart: "Sing until you're as famous as Mei Lanfang; 'Sing until you don't have to worry about clothing and food.'" Becoming as famous as Mei Lanfang, she felt was simply a dream. As far as she knew, even now, no one in the profession could even dare hope for such a thing. Those better than her, older than her, didn't even consider it. How could she dare? Even if she sang her whole life, she was afraid it would be impossible. As for singing until she didn't have to worry about clothing and food, that was easier! But what was worth considering was what Mrs. Mo meant by "not having to worry about clothing and food"? How much money would she need to have in hand to not have to worry about clothing and food? That depended on how high and how great Mrs. Mo's standards for "eating" and "clothing" were. She remembered that Mrs. Mo used to say: "Sing, sing until you're famous, and in the future, when you have money, you can eat well and dress well." She was almost completely lost about how "good" Mrs. Mo was describing! She thought to herself that even if she sang out a mountain of money, Mrs. Mo would still feel it wasn't enough. Moreover, singing out a "mountain of money" was easier said than done. Even if she sang for another ten or twenty years, she was afraid it wouldn't be enough. Thinking that neither of these two things was something she could easily accomplish, and that Mrs. Mo insisted that she accomplish them, she felt she was finished! She felt she had no hope of rescue, and so she dejectedly hung her head.</p>
<p>"Xiaohua, singing is good! Look at you now, so many people are supporting you! Giving you things, inviting you to eat. When you become even more famous, you'll be even more impressive! Sing well, singing is more useful and promising than anything else." Mrs. Mo coaxed Lihua in a didactic tone. "But, haven't you seen Uncle Shi? Uncle Shi became like that because of singing," Lihua suddenly raised her head and retorted in defiance.</p>
<p>"That's because he didn't sing well. People looked down on him, so he went crazy!" Mrs. Mo said dismissively.</p>
<p>"If I also don't sing well, I'll also go crazy! What will I do?"</p>
<p>"No, you absolutely won't, Xiaohua!" Mrs. Mo said with conviction. "You're still very young, and your future is bright! Stop thinking nonsense."</p>
<p>"No, I want to grow old, I want to fall down like Uncle Shi! So, I want to stop singing as soon as possible, to avoid being looked down upon in the future," Lihua said calmly.</p>

<p>—Beautiful Darkness—</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was very timid. One day, I told my mother again that I was afraid of the dark. She said, "Child, you don't understand the beauty of darkness."</p>
<p>That evening, I saw her turn off the lights and sit alone in the dark. She said, "If you want to come, come. I won't force you. However, if you sit still in the dark, and look clearly, you can see many things that you cannot see in the bright light of day." I sat down beside her, and she pointed out to me how everything in the room had changed, and many things that seemed mundane in the light now seemed new and interesting. The bed looked like nothing more than a place to rest, and the patterns on the bedsheets that could be seen during the day were now invisible. The various forms of the chairs could not be distinguished at this time. Everything in the room seemed especially quiet and intimate.</p>
<p>The next evening, my mother and I sat by the window in the dark, listening quietly to the hymns coming from the distant church, and watching the old trees in the courtyard bloom with white flowers, looking as pure and white as snow in the hazy starlight. From that day on, I often followed my mother every night, turning off the lights in the house and going to experience the quiet beauty of the darkness. Once, while sitting in the dark, my mother said, "Don't be afraid. Recognize what you're afraid of, and you won't be afraid anymore."</p>
<p>Years later, I had started my own family. Once, when I suffered a major financial setback, I sat down with my family to discuss how to deal with it. We turned off the lights again and sat in the dark. We often turned off the lights whenever we wanted to listen to music quietly, or discuss something attentively. But that time, sitting in the dark, I suddenly remembered my mother's words. We had all felt timid at first, but I immediately realized that we should deal with it calmly.</p>
<p>As a result, we overcame all the difficulties. At the same time, through the family's united efforts, we tasted many joys of life.</p>
<p>The lessons my mother taught me when I was a child because I was afraid of the dark, unexpectedly helped me overcome a dangerous crisis many years later. It not only added to my courage, but also instilled in me an attitude of "appreciating life", which helped me solve many problems in life.</p>
<h3>Stuttering and Left-Handedness</h3>
<p>— Nai Fan</p>
<p>Stuttering seems to be a prevalent condition. Although it does not threaten people's health, it does cause inconvenience, especially in social situations. Stuttering is quite unsightly. People who stutter cannot become politicians, lawyers, or teachers. In short, a person who stutters will suffer greatly in many situations.</p>
<p>However, what causes stuttering? Are there any methods of treatment? These are questions that everyone is concerned about.</p>
<p>According to psychological research, stuttering is related to left-handedness.</p>
<p>What is left-handedness? It is necessary to explain that first. Normally, people mainly use their right hand for work. The right hand is stronger, and its use is also more flexible. Psychologists have discovered that this characteristic of using the right hand is not due to learning, but is a congenital endowment. Therefore, 97 or 98 percent of people are right-handed, but there are also 2 or 3 percent who are exceptions: they are left-handed.</p>
<p>Left-handedness is hereditary. Whether holding a pen, using chopsticks, bouncing a ball, ..., left-handed people find it more convenient to use their left hand. Although there are fewer left-handed people, they can often be found, just like stuttering.</p>
<p>However, because most people are right-handed, the characteristics of a left-handed child are often ignored by parents or teachers. When the child is learning to hold a pen, use chopsticks, ..., they think it is imitating incorrectly. Therefore, through correction or even punishment, the left-handed child is forced to work with the right hand. The child is ignorant and naturally has to follow along. However, this causes stuttering.</p>
<p>According to psychological research, the nerves for language and the nerves for the movement of the dominant hand are located adjacent to each other in the brain. Therefore, when a left-handed child is forced to use the right hand, the language nerves are disturbed because of their proximity. As a result, speech cannot be uttered smoothly, and stuttering develops.</p>
<p>Therefore, parents and teachers should pay special attention to children with a hereditary predisposition to left-handedness. There is no need to force them to use their right hand; otherwise, the child may develop stuttering as an adult.</p>

<h3>The Ideal Family of the Future</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo Xi</p>
<p>On a corner of Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, there stands a novel and unique house, adorned with beautiful American cedar walls and a shimmering aluminum roof. Inside, the house has five rooms, and the interior design and furnishings are all original and ingenious. Los Angeles architect Penster deliberately built this house as a kind of experiment. Inside the house, there is an electronic dust absorber, an indoor transportation system, five remotely controlled speakers, more than ten electrical switches, a toilet with neon lights, a sterilizing electric light, a sound-absorbing ceiling, and an electric toothbrush. This electric toothbrush is made of rubber and operates by vibrating with electricity when brushing teeth, saving the trouble of brushing.</p>
<p>Since the house was opened to the public in March, visitors have flocked to it, marveling at this modern architecture. The architect's goal is to determine, from public criticism, which of the new family furnishings best suit the tastes of the general public.</p>
<p>This house is assumed to be for a family of four, a couple and two children. The entire house is U-shaped, surrounding the courtyard, with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one guest room, one living room, one dining room, one kitchen, one workshop, and one garage. All rooms are equipped with air conditioners, so it is warm in winter and cool in summer.</p>
<p>It cost Pence a full US$75,000 to build this house. Although it is because the interior furnishings are too luxurious, it ultimately fails to solve the basic problem of family architecture, that is, exquisite technology and low cost. However, once this problem is solved, won't we be able to enjoy this comfortable and luxurious charming residence?</p>
<p>Pence-style kitchens, whether large and highly mechanized family factories, are equipped with scientific lighting, artificial ventilation, and sound absorbers, as well as various procedures to simplify cooking and housework. All the machines weigh a total of 2,000 pounds. On one side of the wall is installed a four-burner gas stove, next to a bowl rack and cabinet for preparing food. In front of the large glass window, there is a garbage disposal mechanism and a hydraulic dishwasher, followed by a chest of four drawers, each storing different foods. Opposite the glass window is a fully equipped laundry area, with a washing machine, a dryer, and an iron. There is also a drying machine.</p>
<p>The center of the kitchen is the nerve center of the entire house, the core of an indoor transportation system. From here, you can talk to all the rooms. From here, you can remotely control the opening and closing of lights and radios, open and close doors, and turn on lawn sprinklers.</p>

Now they can finally take a breath. The people in charge of factories and institutions have decided to give women quite a long vacation, allowing them to travel and rest in various places.

<h3>Torment (4)</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>The Torment of Publishers</p>
<p>The publishers referred to here are certainly not those with connections and subsidies, but rather those who are independently capitalized and self-managed. The former publish their names and promote their reality; they cannot be included in the cultural world at all. They do not have the torment of ordinary publishers; their torment is failure outside of publishing. Only the latter are true publishers, and they are now in extreme torment.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about capital. Their capital belongs to shareholders, or their individual costs are so high that their business has no certainty of making money. No matter how good a manuscript is, no matter how much the editors they employ plead, they cannot but carefully consider the survival of their entire business and can only collect the most profitable manuscripts. They want to make legitimate promotions, but that would endanger the survival of their business. They will not do that! Their creed is: it is best not to accept manuscripts and use the funds for other profitable avenues; it is best not to pay for accepted manuscripts, because royalties are cheaper than labor; to typeset but not print, because the typeset words will not sell, unlike blank paper that can be readily converted into cash; to print but not sell, because the market is rising every day, and selling is not enough to cover costs, so it is better to wait for the price to rise sufficiently, or for the market to stabilize, before selling, so that the money earned is more practical. They are willing to use the capital they can use to do some cultural undertakings in addition to making money, but the environment does not allow it, so they have no choice but to listen helplessly.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about connections. They have no connections. They do a poor job, and they are already tormented; they do a good job, and they still cannot avoid torment. Why? Often, some people want to give them connections, want to take advantage of their lack of connections.</p>
<p>Naturally, they also want to find a way out. They want to change careers, but like the editors, they are used to this line of work and cannot change. If it is a larger bookstore, with a large scale and many employees, even closing the store is not easy. The publisher who is in charge is truly tormented to the extreme!</p>
<p>Who should they blame, what should they blame? They can only blame the environment!</p>

<h3>A Foolish Thing</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Walking out of the house, a red fire hydrant on the side of the road was constantly flowing water, as big as a bowl. People like rickshaw drivers and laborers were using this free tap water to wash their hands and feet and other things. I stopped and saw that the hydrant cap was probably stolen, so the water flowed freely onto the road.</p>
<p>It's such a waste for it to flow like this day and night. I should report it to the water company, I thought.</p>
<p>The sun was very harsh, and I also had something urgent to do, but I still ran to a public telephone booth, spent three hundred yuan on a phone call, and reported the incident to the Shanghai Water Company. The conversation on the phone was as follows:</p>
<p>[Me] Hello! Is this the water company?</p>
<p>[Company] Hmm! What's the matter?</p>
<p>[Me] A tap on Huangdu Road is broken, and water is constantly flowing out. Please send someone to repair it quickly.</p>
<p>[Company] Which tap?</p>
<p>[Me] It's the red tap next to the road.</p>
<p>[Company] Where is it?</p>
<p>[Me] At the end of North Sichuan Road, Huangdu Road, formerly called Huanglu Road.</p>
<p>[Company] Where are you calling from, the police station?</p>
<p>[Me] No, I live nearby.</p>
<p>[Company] Oh! Got it.</p>
<p>Two days later, until I wrote this article now, the tap still has no cap, and it has been flowing water for two days and nights for nothing, and it is still flowing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company probably doesn't care about this little leak, I thought, blowing a pool of spring water, did I make a fool of myself!</p>
<h3>A Fierce Tiger!</h3>
<p>— Zhang Minfu</p>
<p>The setting sun slanted down, and in the shadows under the eaves of the thatched hut, many bare-backed, barefoot farmers were sheltering.</p>
<p>"Alas! What kind of year is this! No harvest year after year, and now some plague has broken out." Old Man Liu took his pipe away from his mouth and said gloomily.</p>
<p>"It's true! It's been a real mess these past few days! A dozen or so strong young men died in a row; now it's even worse. That bitch Deyun was just carried out yesterday, and Deyun's brother and his mother are making a big fuss again—hum, scary!..." Zhao Lao Er, who had a shaved head, shook his head sadly. When he said the last sentence, he seemed to be afraid of something and swallowed the last half of the sentence back.</p>
<p>Old Man Liu looked up at the sky, as if thinking gloomily. Fear was evident on the faces of everyone sitting there.</p>
<p>After a long silence, a bare-backed young man suddenly broke it; he said in surprise: "It's really strange; everyone says that if everyone pretends to be celebrating the New Year, they can get through this unfortunate year, and the plague god will withdraw his magic power and return to heaven. But recently, many people have come, some pasting up hanging flags, some pasting up door couplets; why hasn't it had any effect?"</p>
<p>"Alas! It's useless." Old Man Liu sighed as he spoke. "In the past, Mr. Shen's acupuncture skills were like magic. Whenever someone got this disease, bringing him over for a needle would be enough. Also, Master Hu's holy water was like a panacea; patients who drank it would see immediate results. Now it's very different: Old Man Nian, Deyun..., they've had acupuncture, they've drunk holy water, and I heard they even made a vow at the temple; but none of it has worked!"</p>
<p>"Is there no savior at all, and do you just die if you get sick?" several people asked disappointedly.</p>
<p>"There is a savior." Old Man Liu lit his pipe and continued, "Didn't Mr. Li Si, who came from the city, say that in this day and age, you have to see a foreign doctor to treat this disease. They say the disease is called 'Cholera,' and getting a foreign injection and taking foreign medicine will cure it."</p>
<p>"Then why not invite a foreign doctor to treat it? It's so scary to see one die after another!"</p>
<p>"Bah!..." The old man curled his lips, with a contemptuous look. "Foreign doctors? That's only for the rich old masters! It costs tens of thousands of coins to treat it once; can we Zhuangmu heads afford it? I'm afraid selling the ancestral grave wouldn't be enough to treat it twice, would it?"</p>
<p>Everyone stared at each other, and the bare-backed young man couldn't help sticking out his tongue.</p>
<p>They knew there was no other way, so they had to comfort themselves by saying: "Calamity is predestined, and it's hard to escape fate; it's no use being afraid of death, so let's leave it to fate!"</p>
<p>"Alas,..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cry-like voice came from afar: "Grandpa Qiao'er!..." Everyone's eyes almost all fell on the face of an old woman who was getting closer and closer; especially Old Man Liu, who was smoking, widened his eyes even more; because he already knew that the person who came in a panic was his wife.</p>
<p>"What is it, what is it?" he asked in panic.</p>
<p>"It's terrible!... Qiao'er's... grandpa... is also... vomiting... diarrhea..." She choked up when she said the last sentence.</p>
<p>Old Man Liu's lips immediately turned pale, and the wrinkled skin on his face was also twitching; the pipe in his mouth fell to the ground unconsciously. From his panting, it seemed as if he was calling out painfully: "Terrible 'Cholera'!" Immediately, his body collapsed as if paralyzed.</p>
<p>Young farmers helped the trembling Old Man Liu behind them, followed by the sobbing old woman.</p>
<p>In the shadows under the eaves of the thatched hut, everything was very quiet, except for the buzzing of flies on a few melon tendrils.</p>
<p>The next morning, a bunch of paper money was inserted high on the door of Old Man Liu's house; the wind blowing through, making a rustling sound. Several old women stood in front of the door, some lifting their clothes to wipe away tears, while a burst of mournful women's cries came from inside; "Liu—you left our children and adults!..." Although it was a hoarse voice, her painful cries did not diminish because of it.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the atmosphere in the village has become even more tense. Children wearing white mourning clothes ran around in the streets, and bursts of crying could be heard everywhere.</p>
<p>Recently, according to the highest administrative meeting in the village, it was decided to recite a Taoist scripture in the next few days. Sprinkle holy water on the streets at night, which can allegedly annihilate the plague-spreading ghosts and gods.</p>
<h3>Summer Scenery in Chang'an</h3>
<p>— Dong Yang</p>
<p>Xi'an has become more and more lively recently. Every day, countless travelers pass through here, and many guests stay for a short time; those who want to return to Beiping mostly take the Shaanxi Provincial Railway Bureau's bus to Hancheng from here, go to Shanxi, pass through the Zhengtai Railway and return to Beiping, or still take the train east to Shanghai and return to Beiping by sea.</p>
<p>The climate in Xi'an has been very hot recently. This is very different from previous years, and its heat is almost the same as that of Shanghai and Hankou at this time. Ice cream has long been on the market for five hundred yuan a cup, and more people come out to stroll on the streets every afternoon. It is really lively in the popular urban areas of Dong Dajie and Nan Yuanmen. Cheongsam with floral prints seem to have become the most popular fashion for women, and women in the countryside are also vying to wear them, regardless of whether they fit or not. There are three movie theaters in total, with four shows a day, and almost every show is full, but there are also many viewers who don't buy tickets. Therefore, the owners of the movie theaters have been constantly complaining recently.</p>
<p>There are also more cars on the road. Jeeps and American four-wheeled trucks are often speeding; but they drive too fast, and accidents often happen. There are also public buses running from Dongmen to Ximen recently, with a full fare of two hundred yuan, which is considered cheap. If you get off at the bell tower, it is only one hundred yuan. However, only four cars are running, and they often break down, and each time the cars are overcrowded. Recently, someone has proposed repairing and paving asphalt roads, but no concrete measures have been seen.</p>
<p>The reconstruction brought a university—National Northwest University, an independent college, and National Northwest Institute of Technology to Xi'an. Most of the faculty and students of these two schools have recently come to Xi'an from Chenggu. The school's instruments and books are also being moved by hand. The site of Northwest University is the former site of Northeast University outside Ximen, and the president is Mr. Liu Jihong. The site of Northwest Institute of Technology is within the old No. 1 Middle School in Zao Ci Lane, and the president is Mr. Pan Chengxiao. However, the site of the institute is not enough. Recently, the Assets Committee has allocated the site of the Xianyang Alcohol Factory, which has been closed, to the institute for temporary use. The institute will go to take over soon, and it will still be divided into two campuses in the future. The first campus is in Xi'an, and the second campus is in Xianyang.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Xi'an is also very high. Flour has been sold for more than 11,000 yuan a bag, rice for 4,500 yuan a dou, eggs for 100 yuan for two, and haircuts with oil and electric blow-drying for 1,400 yuan per person. Although the salaries of public educators have been adjusted in June, the increase in the Northwest region is very small. Public educators are complaining endlessly. Recently, the judicial sector (Shaanxi Higher Court, Chang'an District Court) and the education sector (Northwest University, Northwest Institute of Technology, and Northwest Medical College, which is about to move to Xi'an) have also successively telegraphed the Executive Yuan to make reasonable adjustments to the salaries of public educators.</p>
<h3>Ideological Test of German Teenagers</h3>
<p>— Translated by Deng Xi</p>
<p>In an infant prisoner-of-war camp in Concarneau, France, more than 7,000 German teenage prisoners, aged 12 to 17, are being influenced by democratic ideas under the guidance and management of French military officers. This year in April, two informal democratic ideology tests were successively held in the camp, with a total of more than 200 questions.</p>
<p>One of the questions was: "Is Hitler a mad criminal?" The results showed that 2,960 people answered yes, 2,951 answered no, and the remaining 981 were hesitant.</p>
<p>Another question was: "Should Nazi soldiers be held responsible for Germany's failure?" The results showed that 2,575 people answered "yes," 2,300 people answered "no," and for the question "If the Nazi leaders captured by the United Nations now were ordered to be hanged one by one, would that be okay?" Of the 7,000 people, 3,170 said "yes," and 2,923 said no.</p>
<p>And did they think it was right and sinful that their country was defeated this time? To this question, 4,347 people said it was right. And their failure this time was the most sinful. Regarding their views on mixed-race children, "I will never marry a Jewish woman because she will lower the value of me and my descendants," only 514 people thought it was right, while 6,056 people thought it was nonsense.</p>
<p>This series of questions and answers is worth studying. The anti-Jewish movement was originally used by the Nazis as a guise to promote the war, but the youth of the country were not deeply poisoned by it. As for whether they deliberately planned well when answering the test, that is unknown.</p>

<h3>Small Matter</h3>
<p>— Xiao Min Shen Jian</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>After reading the first article of your newspaper's "Free Talk", "Small Matter," I couldn't help but think of a matter that was even smaller than a small matter, perhaps because its impression was indeed a bit too much for people! Today, I specifically venture to ask the relevant authorities about it; - it seems that it is already midsummer according to the current climate and season, but the trees planted on both sides of Zhongzheng East Road from the Bund to the Great World are still living in the severe winter under this hot climate, still wearing the winter coat - rice straw, I really don't understand what the intention is! I respectfully ask for your well-being, Xiao Min Shen Jian</p>
<h3>Secrets of the Brain</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>The Pituitary Gland of Geniuses is Particularly Developed</p>
<p>What are the characteristics of the brains of geniuses? This is a mystery that scientists have been constantly exploring. The secret of the genius brain lies not in the size of the brain itself, but in the size of the blood vessels that nourish the brain.</p>
<p>There are arteries and veins in the meninges, and their size and structure are absolutely related to the strength of brainpower; as for the size, weight, and structure of the brain itself, it is irrelevant.</p>
<p>As early as 1926, Dr. Hai Zhi began to systematically study the brain vessels and meninges of geniuses and ordinary people. He found that the brain blood vessels of geniuses are particularly rich and complex.</p>
<p>The structure, size, and weight of the genius brain are not much different from those of ordinary people. The real difference is the excellent meninges, with many blood vessels; the brain of ordinary people has small and constricted blood vessels.</p>
<p>The brain is not an "isolated faction," it is inevitably stimulated by other organs. The brain has a close relationship with the glands of the human body.</p>
<p>Patients with schizophrenia are a good example, caused by the disharmony of the pituitary gland and adrenal glands. The substance secreted by the adrenal glands is like the gas that ignites the flames of human thought; without it, no light can be produced.</p>
<p>Disorders of the thyroid gland directly affect the brain. Slow thinking is closely related to the sluggishness of the gonads and thyroid gland.</p>
<p>The pituitary gland of geniuses is particularly developed, and the activity of the gonads and thyroid gland reach their peak.</p>
<p>The adrenal glands and pituitary gland are also closely related. If the adrenal glands are healthy, the pituitary gland must also be healthy, and the brain is also healthy. If a gland has a declining phenomenon, the brain's movement and activity will immediately become ineffective.</p>
<p>The secret of the genius brain has only now been correctly revealed. All past theories were not correct.</p>
<h3>Hesitation</h3>
<p>— Yi Gu</p>
<p>I have an uncle who, due to business relations, became acquainted with the manager of a Huorong Match Factory. This match factory was the owner of the goods on the truck that crashed in Zhenru. That manager was also the cargo escort on the truck. During the crash, he was thrown several *wen* away; therefore, although he was injured, he was fortunate enough to escape the disaster, while those in the truck were burned to death because they could not escape.</p>
<p>After the accident, according to his account of the situation at the time: "This happened in the early morning, when the earth barely revealed a glimmer of dawn. However, the cause of the crash was not necessarily due to poor visibility. The biggest reason was probably the truck driver's hesitation and inability to make a decisive decision. Because, although the sky was dim, a long train coming from afar was at least vaguely discernible in shape and sound. If he had immediately stopped the truck and waited for the express train to pass, then this tragedy would not have happened at all. Even if he had accelerated and taken a risk, there was a chance that he could have crossed the tracks. The problem was that he wanted to go across but didn't dare to, and if he didn't go across, he would immediately brake. He missed the most precious moment, and when he wanted to rush across again, the collision occurred because the train had arrived."</p>
<p>Looking at the above facts, we can see that no matter what we do, we often fail due to a lack of courage and perseverance, resulting in missed opportunities. And worldly education tells us that the most important secret to success is to make decisive decisions, because hesitation is the greatest enemy of success.</p>
<p>The principle of how great people deal with things is to first calmly observe and consider the pros and cons of the matter, and then make a decision. Once a decision is made, there is absolutely no room for turning back. Even if one unfortunately fails, one will never be discouraged or regret the inappropriate decision. One can only immediately find another way to remedy the situation. When facing a crisis of success or failure, there is no extra time for thinking, and one should quickly and with a firm attitude immediately decide what to do.</p>
<p>People who yearn for success, stop hesitating! Making decisive decisions is your only good medicine!</p>
<h3>Children of the Times</h3>
<p>— Wu Daquan</p>
<p>Children of the times,</p>
<p>Standing at the cutting edge of the era,</p>
<p>Modern,</p>
<p>Loving beauty,</p>
<p>Without souls,</p>
<p>Their souls have long been taken away by pigs,</p>
<p>They are like a straw,</p>
<p>Unable to withstand the blowing of the celestial wind,</p>
<p>Simply,</p>
<p>Completely doomed.</p>
<p>Sunglasses paint everything with a layer of color,</p>
<p>White-skinned, silk-stockinged young ladies only know how to show off on waxed floors,</p>
<p>Bright clothes are free from any working dust,</p>
<p>Strange handbags flaunt past.</p>
<p>Go away,</p>
<p>Such children!</p>
<p>China is waiting for you to build a strong country,</p>
<p>I'm afraid it's like a blind man waiting for dawn,</p>
<p>It's just a spring dream.</p>
<h3>Flying is Not Dangerous</h3>
<p>Do you see this plane crashing into the corner of the house? This plane encountered bad air currents, glided down, and the pilot, Mr. Jia Shide, is very safe. The incident occurred in the central United States.</p>

<h3>Death of a Traitor – Obligatory Obituary in Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Thousands of German people, under the order of the Allied Nations, held an anti-British demonstration in the city center square, singing the national anthem "Germany Above All Else." In our country, there are still middle school students reading "National Standard Textbooks" from the puppet government. Comparing the people of the defeated and victorious countries is frightening!</p>
<p>If Chen Gongbo, Miao Bin, and many other major traitors had died during the occupied period, their obituaries would have been published in all the newspapers. Now, after being executed, it didn't cost a penny, and the whole world knows, and all the newspapers in the country inadvertently provided them with an obligatory obituary advertisement each.</p>
<p>Mr. Pi asks him, "Do you want a tight one?" Does Miss Pi want it or not? I believe he will definitely shake his head to express his opposition. Wu's friends are often tireless and unaware of their stink, but they are unwilling to live with people with bad breath, avoiding them as if they were afraid of catching the plague. These are all very common things, and they are also the most unforgivable. Why?</p>
<p>Foreign goods are flooding in, but exports are scarce. Can this phenomenon be ignored? Indeed, the imbalance of import and export has some similarities with abnormal eating habits. Eating too much is harmful to the stomach and intestines, and adding to the fact that bowel movements are blocked is of course dangerous. At the same time, diarrhea without end and no nourishment is also unreasonable. How to restore health depends on the doctor's methods.</p>
