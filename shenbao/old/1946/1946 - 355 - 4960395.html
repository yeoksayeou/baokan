<h3>憲法草案一讀竣事　國大會期再延二日</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕國民大會第十二次大會，二十日晨九時半舉行，出席代表一二〇八人，蔣主席與夫人均會出席。主席團由白崇禧等第二組輪值，由程濟担任主席，行禮如儀後，主席宣布今日議程爲綜合審查會報告審查結果，當即由綜合會召集人陳誠出席報告，陳氏首先報告該組審查範圍及審查間題，旋即遂條加以說明審查及修正情形，（全文見左角關綱）至十時五十分　，陳氏以小時又十分之時間一口氣呵萬比項冗長之報告，中途曾句主席是否可以休息，主席謂繼續報告。余於疲勞中即開快車報告完畢，全塲報以熱烈之　聲。是時主席宣佈：今日不進行討論。當由洪秘書長報告各代表如對綜合審查結果有何意見，可按照大會議事規則第廿四條之規定辦理。旋有女佩蘭等爭相發言，質詢綜合會所通過之立委選擇舉婦女名額等，何以遺漏報告，是時秘書長一再宣布，今日不進行討論，即時宣布散會。此制憲過程之一讀階段，即於茲完畢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕國大主席國廿日上午十一時，舉行第廿二次會議，出席白崇禧等卅餘人，決議大會再延期兩日，至廿四日　。廿一日上午九時及下午三時舉行第十三次大會，上午由胡適任主席，下午由朱家驊任主席。並聞主席團前昨兩次會議，經長時間討論，擬定　政實施程序辦法五條，將提出大會討輪。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二十日電」第一屆國大女代表聯誼會，今午於勵志社問成立大會，當塲選出理事羅衡，錢劍秋，包德明，皮以書，沈慧運，周蜀雲，張默君，黃佩蘭，錢用和，呂曉道，王立文，候補理事張邦珍，　俠，陳逸雲，王孝英，羅靜軒，監事呂雲章、羅靜軒，崔震華，崔淑言，吳貽芳，候補監事紀淸漪，胡蘭，王孝華，全體公推蔣夫人爲理事長，並討論全力支持國大婦女名額，應佔百分之二十。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二十日電〕國民政府直接遴選之國民大會代表黃伯英，因事不克出席大會，註銷名籍，遺　以陳袞補充比令。</p>
<h3>綜審會臨時會議　對若干問題作最後審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕憲草綜合審委會廿日下午九時三刻，舉行臨時會議，對若干留待解決之問題，作最後審查。到林彬，史尚寬等八十三人，陳誠主席，首報告國都問題，因各方尚在商洽中，留待最後審查。</p>
<p>繼討論諸未決問題，陳誠等四十餘人提請將第五十八條第二第三款中「全體」二字，改爲「出席」無異議通過。次討論婦女在選舉中所應佔名額，決議：「各種選舉，應規定婦女名額，其辦法以法律定之。第一審委會原通過之「至少佔百分之二十」等字樣，刪去。</p>
<p>繼討論內地生活習慣特殊國民代表名額問題，決議：「各種選舉應規定內地生活習慣特殊之國民代表名額，其選舉辦怯，以法律定之」。關於西藏地方自治制度問題，原定；「憲怯應予以保障」，若干代表認憲法中再有「憲法應予以保障」等字探，殊屬不妥，僉主將「憲怯」二字删去，改成「西藏地方自治制度，應于以保障」。最後討論憲法中增列罷兌·創制·複決等條款一事，該案本已原則通過，交由整理小組作文字上之修正。阮毅盛等認國人對罷免等咸無經騐，若僅於憲法中對三種民權作總統之規定，將來必引起問題，並增加未來國大之困難，不若另由法律規定爲佳。江一平亦認罷免可於憲法中規定創造，複決，似以法律規定爲宜。任卓宣則持不同意見，認國大對罷免等固無經騐，對選舉經騐亦不足夠，不能因此主張不將罷免等列入憲法。渠認憲怯對上述三種民權，在原則上應有若干規定。林彬亦主張最好能有原則規定，俾爲將來制定法律之根據。其他代表對文字亦提出若干修正意見。陳誠亦認關於罷免，憲草第一三二條已規定「被選舉人得由原選舉區依法罷免之」，可不必再予規定。以法制，複決兩權之行使，創律另定之爲妥。各代表咸予同意，決議第一審委會所增列之五條關於罷免，原草案已有規定，不再規定。關於創制與複決兩權，其行使以法律定之。</p>
<p>討論竣事後，孔庚等三十人臨時動議，盼對行憲過滙條款，能有所規定，並由孔說明略謂，本屆國大主要任務有二：即制憲與決定行憲日期，現制憲工作已完成十之八九，憲法完成後立即行憲，勢不可能，然行憲「總得行一下」，在總統未選舉前，憲怯如何頒布，此事關於國家民族及人民安危殊鉅，希望能將「憲怯施行程序怯」附於憲法之後，否則將成無無所依據，而成不合怯行動。並聲明此事爲代表之責任與黨派無涉，亦非頑固。最後經一致決議，將此一臨時動議，送交主席團。至此某代表忽要求討論國都問題，與會者咸認此事尚待研討，今日不予討論，會議於十一時許散會。</p>

<h3>張含英考察歸來談　黃河寶藏極豐富　防制水患並非無辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕水利委會於今夏組織黃河洽本研究團，聘該會委員張含英爲團長，劉德潤，雷鴻基，李賦都，周禮，張邇駿，譚葆泰等爲團員，於本年七月自京出發，沿河實地老察四閱月。現已返京。記者走訪張幽長，承告如次；</p>
<p>（一）行程：該團離京後，於豫晉交界沿河上溯，繼循晉陜交界以至壺口，再上去靑海之貴德，研究上源，復由蘭州沿河至寗夏，北繞河套，東去包頭，以達歸綏，中游以上不能達到者，僅托克托至壺口之一段。</p>
<p>（二）研究目的：一爲减除卞游水患，一爲查勘黃河有無可開發之資源，防制水患，須上下游並重，在上游爲節制洪流，减少泥沙，使下游不致發生危險之洪永及過效之於澱，在下游則爲培修堤防，調整河糟，使水流就範；可惜下游因故道未復，無法考察。</p>
<p>（三）中游建水庫：僅就上中游言，欲控制洪流，可於陝縣三門峽及新安縣之八里胡同修建水庫，新安築　攔水，即可節制下游之流　於一萬秒立方公尺之下，據此流　，以調整下游河道，必可防節洪水，不致出槽，並可發生一百廿萬馬匹之電力，惟水庫積淤問題，誠爲重要，欲謀救濟，必施以其他工事，以减少洪流之下行，如岸灘之保護，溝壑之防止，田畝之利用等；而其他永庫工程之典建，亦足减少本水庫積淤之嚴重性，如於晋陝交界龍門上游之石門另築水庫，不特有極大之經濟價值，且有助於八里胡同蓄水防沙之功能；蓋石門永庫成功，不僅可節制一部份洪水，積儲一部份泥沙，又可發電力八十萬馬力，並可灌溉渭北高原及汾河下游之田，又能解決一部份航運間題。八里胡同水庫目的偏重於節制洪水，石門水庫則爲多目標之發展，極富經濟價值。　價水電爲發展工業之源泉。在初原因工業尚未發達，或苦本能用盡，但可利以提升河水，供溉高地之田，此實爲當地目前所急需，蓋華北最大富源爲土地，而土地生產量之所以不豐，由於雨水之不充，故現以河水所發之電，提高河水以溉田，實兩得其用，無虞電力之無銷路。</p>
<p>（四）綏寗平原之灌溉：寗夏綏遠平原實爲利用黃河灌田之優良地點，現雖略具規模，但尚未盡其用。寗綏居於邊疆，沿河平原實爲邊區糧庫，關係國防者至大，此次抗戰，已可得一例證，後套可溉之田的一千萬畝，現得水利者僅一一一之一，莫他包頭，歸綏之平原，尚未計算在內；寗夏現溉面積約三百萬畝，於改進後，即可增加一倍；寗綏平原之外　，即賀蘭山，狼山，烏拉山，亦即天然防綫，身臨其境，益感寗綏水利有提前改進之必要。又余等乘羊皮筏行經甘寗間黃河山峽，覺可利用之處甚多，如於黑山峽中修築一壩，抬高水位，則同心城以北之沙荒皆可得水墾植；其他尚可利用之處尚多。</p>
<p>（五）日本治黃計劃之得失：至日本治黃之目的，專事開發費河之電力，不與其他事業配合，非吾國之所需，故其計劃，實待進一步之研究。</p>
<p>張氏最後復表示此次查勘，爲時間所限，不僅下游未去，即各大支流亦未到，深以爲憾，蓋以治理黃河，非上中下三游兼國，本支兼籌不可，但就考察所及，巳知防制黃河水患，非無辦法，而且寳藏甚豐，可供開發九省經濟事業之用。</p>

<h3>社論　貨幣國際管制的開始</h3>
<p>國際貨幣基金會於一昨宣布各會員國法定匯率，定明年三月一日開始實行，而其中我國等八國却不及參加，要求暫緩宣布。這是晚近國際閒一件值得重視的大事。它之所以值得重視，不在匯率標準的訂定，而是在於國際貨幣基金會的各會員國感覺到各該國的貨幣應該有更進一步的國際合作和管制，一國對於自身貨幣的管制，原本該國主權所在，應有處理自由，不受國際管制。所以對於本國貨幣匯率的規定，即本國貨幣對外價值的提高或貶低，各國原有全權處理。可是一國貨幣對外價值的提高或貶低，影響所及，不特攸關各該國本身經濟的榮枯，而且往往牽涉到國際的利益。因此，在過去，爲了確定貨幣的匯率標準，各國彼此間就有關於貨幣匯率的協定；如在一九二九大不景氣的時代，英美間就有關於貨幣匯率的協定，同時爲穩定以白銀爲本位的我國幣制，又有白銀協定，以安定白銀的價格，維持我國的幣制。</p>
<p>這次國際貨幣基余會會員國法定匯率的宣布，表明一宗事實，就是各國對於貨幣匯率的規定，已接受了國際管制的原則。換一句話說，一個國家在它對於貨幣的管制上，己將一部主權移交給一個國際機構。這是這一宗事實，所以這次國際貨幣基金會會員國法定匯率的宣布，爲晚近國際間值得重視的一件大事。誠如該基金會所發布的文告內所云：「目前此一舉措的主要意義，不在所宣布之匯率，而在各參加國之己創立一種制度，在此制度之下，彼此允諾協力維持匯兌的安定，除依照基金協定所規定之條款外，對各該國貨幣不爲怯定匯率的變更，以協力達成基金的目的。」值得我們注意的是「除依照基余協定所規定的條款外，對各該國貨幣不爲法定匯率的變更。」由此可知，一國貨幣對外價值的提高或貶低，己不能由一國任意處理，而必須得到國際的協力。</p>
<p>這是一種國際間更趨於緊密合作的好現象。第一次世界大戰後發見在歐洲的貨幣混亂情形，至今印象猶新。爲防制此項事態的重演，國際貨幣基金的建立，其目的端在穩定戰後各國金融。一國金融的不上軌道，不僅自身深感其苦，而且有關國際。這次各國貨幣法定匯率的規定，其間縱或與現實情形容有若干距離，但此種事實，祗要各該國樂於接受，原無不可，况法定匯率之規定，並不就是等於是項法定匯率之，永久不變。相反的，國際貨幣基余會的一種重要責任，却就在隨時審察前項怯定匯率有無變更的必要。所以此次國際基金會各會員國怯定匯率的宣布，僅是貨幣之國際管制的初步。前項怯定匯率不特將來如有必要，可由基金會變動；基金會並可運用其基金以維持會員國的幣制。此誠「天下一家」精神的良好表現。</p>
<p>我們所感到遺憾的，就是像這樣一種重要的國際舉措，而沒有蘇聯的參加，終不免使「天下一家」留下了一些缺憾。蘇聯是社會主義的國家，它的經濟體系自與別國不同；但我們所不解的就是爲什麼在不同的經濟體系中不可能有國際貨幣管制的合作。這個缺憾，我們相信决不是所謂　「兩個世界」的徵兆；在貨幣的國際管制上，像在軍備的國際管制上一樣，我們也需要蘇聯的合作。</p>
<p>至於我國貨幣法定匯率的暫緩宣布，原爲當前客觀事實之所不可避免的。不過暫緩僅是一個時間問題，問題本身不因時間的延緩而消滅。據所發表的各國法定匯率，多係依照現有匯率而定，如法郎一一九·二〇一的折合美金一元，似即係依據現有的官定匯率。環繞在我國法定匯率的問題很多，國際貨幣基金會旣可以審察時機，隨時變更法定匯率，似乎我們不必一定過於重視初步怯定匯率的宣布。是則在財政當局，必有蓋籌；就目前的形勢言，此際而有我國暫緩宣布法定匯率的要求，似不失爲一種合時的舉措，應該值得我們稱道的。</p>

<h3>通過塘沽新港船閘　商輪直駛津沽成功　北洋綫航運史上闢一新頁</h3>
<p>〔天津訊〕往日各埠航行天津之北洋綫輪船，凡裝載量及三千噸者，因大沽口前方有欄門沙，未能進入海河，必須停泊於欄門沙外，以駁船裝客駁貨至塘沽或天津，須在口外停四五日，此種延期費用損失甚鉅，自本月十五日塘沽新港閘門完竣試航成功後，十六日通運公司新上海輪船吃水十五呎四寸，到達本沽口外，因欄門沙水深僅十二呎，未能進口，乃於十七日九時駛入塘沽新港，通過閘門（爲時僅廿一分鐘），進入海河，即在塘沽舊碼頭靠埠，卸貨一部份後繼駛天津。又十九日午前有三千五百噸之景興號及一千二百噸之中孚號兩輸，亦經過塘沽新港船閘而順利通航，今後赴津沽三千餘噸之輪隻，由上海等處赴津者，可不受大沾口外攔門沙之阻碍而入津沽，此係北洋綫航輪之福音也。</p>

<h3>有史以來最熱鬧的　聖誕節在美國</h3>

<p>飛機降落傘送禮，這樣</p>
<p>一來，禮品真要像神話</p>
<p>上所說的自天而降了…</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十九日電〕美國慶祝聖誕節的工作將於本週內準備就緒。各城鎭的商業區擁擠特甚，救世軍的鈴聲散佈在鬧市的每一角麥，替不幸的人受集捐款，百貨商店裏擠滿購買聖誔禮物的人，人們都想博取父母或子女的歡愉和驚奇。</p>
<p>這一次的聖誔，是美國有史以來最熱鬧的一個。一九三九年聖誕節商人的貿易額是四十五億美元，一九四五年是八十五億美元，本年預料是一百〇五億美元。</p>
<p>據商業部宣稱：因爲出貨過多，所以並沒有爭先搶購的現象，但是本年的聖誔節依然是最熱鬧的一個。雖然近來工潮很多，但是消費品的產量在一九四六年已達最高數字。各公司行家以花紅發給僱員，他們都用來購買聖誔禮品。於是數萬萬元就在聖誕節前落入工作人們的袋中，舉幾個例子，克萊文的杯肯電氣公司共發賞金一百五十萬元。因爲各種廣告做得非常動人，聖誕節的購買活動且在十一月中就開始了。</p>
<p>已往，聖誕老人是用車子送禮的，可是今年異想天開，廣告上都劃上老人用飛機降落傘散發禮品，這樣一來，兒童們更加相信聖誕老人可以在同一日內週游世界，把禮品帶給小朋友們了。</p>
<p>各敎堂，無一綫電廣播部傳播着聖歌。兒童們照例到各家訪問那些生病的人和老人，給他們安慰。</p>
<p>今年的聖誕餘，已因聯合國大會的圓滿成功而更爲發揚光大，誠如美代表奧斯汀所說「在這一時節的成就，已預示我們可以不經戰爭而獲致安全在聯合國的有效促進下，和平將永存不變。」</p>

<p>丁貴堂昨日對該案發表談話稱：「本人於勝利後，奉命接收海關，一切遵奉政府命令辦理，後總稅務司李度奉財政部關務署之命，設立「淪陷區關員審查委員會」，負責審查淪陷區海關官員是否有附逆嫌疑等事，由關務署委派多人爲審查委員。沈傅塵在海關服務已有十年歷史，經委員會查得曾有向日本海關當局報告淪陷區高級官員在後方之姓名情事，故經議決，以沈旣有附逆嫌疑，乃具文呈報重慶總稅務司轉呈關務署核定，應將沈傅塵革職，送請法院查辦。本人時在兼稅務司任內，乃遵奉電令，將沈函送法院偵訊，實則此非本人主張云云。繼對被控各節有所聲明：謂服務海關已近三十年，一向奉公守法，有時因奉命招執行人事，難免得罪於人，此次被控，調查之下，如本人確有一切罪嫌，自當受法律制裁。如認爲係屬誣告，本人當亦依法追究云。」</p>

<h3>奉命澈查軍械庫爆炸案　秦次長蒞滬踏勘　週內可審畢返京　楊署長報告經過認爲不致有陰謀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國防部次長秦德純奉命來滬澈查江灣後勤司令部第一補給區軍械庫爆炸案，已於昨晨八時抵滬。兵工署長楊繼曾，第一補給區司令富文，軍械處長毛成樺等均往迎迓。秦次長下車後，即由富司令陪往補給區招待所休息，并接見各報記者發表談話稱：此次江灣軍火庫之爆炸案，政府極爲重視。以地處上海，國際觀瞻所係，誠爲一不幸事件。至於本案如何處理，尚待與楊署長·富司令等晤談後，始可決定。本人在京已接閱雷韶傑專員及凌承緒副處長之報告書，但因均係初步調查，僅能作鞠審時之參考，當待與各方會商。并實地調查後，始能明瞭真相。秦氏繼稱在滬擬以一週之時間將本案審理完畢，然後返京覆命。</p>
<p>秦氏旋即與楊署長交換意見，楊告以調查經過并述其感想稱：此次爆炸原因，綜合各方報導及實地調查結果，當不致有陰謀存在。因鑒於起炸地點被毀之卡車，向軍火庫一面者，受創甚重，而向外之一部，則全未受創。炸斃士兵之屍體，係仰跌在地，受傷逃出之士兵則均係背部受創，由此可以證明爆炸乃由軍火庫內部開始，炸彈從裏向外炸出。且該日浙江供應局運手溜彈五卡車，其中三卡車係上午運到，盛裝之木箱大部均已損毀。下午運來二卡車之木箱則均完整。故爆炸原因可能係士兵在整理時，因木箱損毀而落地炸裂。根據其本人過去經驗，手溜彈落地，因雷管震動，可能引起爆炸。惟引以爲憾者厥爲分庫長王仁珊，管庫員吳汝鏣·陳漢文三人之潛逃。如僅係畏罪而出此，則使本案之調查徒然增加不少困難。</p>
<h3>巡行被炸場所　向傅庫長詢問</h3>
<p>下午三時，秦次長偕楊署長，富司令，毛處長，包軍法官等驅車赴江灣失事地點實地查勘。自東首爆炸開始地點起，環饒被炸處所巡行一週。時軍械庫長傅濟民尚在督率庫兵清理燼餘，庫內外仍可見遍地彈片，被炸毀之卡車殘骸，亦仍保留原處。未爆炸之砲彈榴彈等，則已檢集後分別堆置。秦次長即於爆炸起始點之廢墟上，向傅庫長略加詢問。據傅稱：出事之日，彼本人係在距倉庫約五百公尺之宿舍中突聞劈劈拍拍手榴彈之爆炸聲，情知不妙，乃自樓上搶跌而下，趨至倉庫附近，則已見彈片橫飛煙霧瀰漫，爆炸聲愈來愈大，不可收拾矣。至於在逃之分庫長王仁山，平日生活甚爲刻苦，足上常穿破布鞋一雙。其家眷確係於爆炸前一日來滬。出事之日上午王曾攜其妻出外，下午出事後，其妻復於六時餘尚在布區內見到，據稱王已知倉庫失事之消息，并對其妻謂即去搶救，但從此即告失蹤。至於管庫員吳汝標及陳漢文兩人，於出事時尚係在場，其後潛逃，想畏懼責任所致。僅庫長於申述時，語氣堅定，惟形容枯槁，面色晦黑，可見數週來之憂慮辛勞。秦次長當即慰勉有加，囑其爲亡羊補牢之計，安心服務，加倍小心，以求將功贖罪。</p>
<h3>安南屑六千噸　分配煤球廠家　廠成本議決　每噸十六萬</h3>

<h3>蔡培覆判貸一死　最高法院判決書全文</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前經高院判處死刑之漢奸蔡培，係無錫人字子平，六十二歲，戰前曾任國民政府交通部參事司長，招商局總辦，內政部民政司長等職，中日戰事發生後，參加偽組織後，歷任偽南京市長，駐日大使，糧食委員會委會長，國府委員等職，於本年七月十八日經高院判處死刑，呈請最高法院覆判，被告蔡培及辯護律師章士釗亦不服上訴，茲經最高法院覆判，改處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終身。茲將最高法院判決書全文，探錄於后：</p>
<p>主文：原判撤銷，蔡培通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終身，財產除酌留家屬必需之生活費外沒收。</p>
<p>理由：本案原判決認定被告即聲請人蔡培（以下簡稱被告），前任國民政府交通部參事司長，招商局總辦，江蘇省行政督察專員，內政部民政司司長等職。中日戰事發生後，國府西遷，曾赴哪禛各省，旋以戰事稍挫，乃逗留滬上意存觀望。迨汪逆精衛組織偽府於南京，被告遂與周逆佛海，梅逆思平勾結，於民國二十九年四月充任偽工商部次長。同年六月，調任偽南京市市長，辦理偽都市政，招集流亡，以實行偽府所謂復興計劃，曾對首都集訓學生發表紃講，極力反對抗戰。又在慶祝偽國府還都周年紀念大會，發表所謂「還都紀念的感想」，文內對於我政府肆意詆毀，又曾赴日本參加敵國紀元二千六百年慶祝典禮。三十一年一月改充偽糧食管理委員會委員長，草擬編制糧食計劃。同年三月充任偽行政院賬務委員，十二月改任偽國民政府政務參贊，三十二年四月特任偽駐日大使，在北平發表談話，表示決心強化「中日親善」關係，五月間抵日覲見敵皇，并歷訪敵內閣大臣近衛，小磯，外務大臣重光，大東亞大臣青木，宮內大臣松平，及敵將阿部松井土肥原等，商談敵偽提攜及全面和平問題。又遍訪德義軸心國駐日大使，以資連絡。同年十一月敵偽簽訂同盟條約，發表談話，以示與敵共同生死。三十四年一月代表陳逆公博贈送敵京市民砂糖八十萬斤，以示親善。同年五月去職，敵皇贈與一等旭日大綬章。歸國後又任偽國府委員，直至敵寇投降後，始行解職等情，係以實行歷次之自白，及在軍統局所具之自白書，并偽組織內所屬之新聞報，新中國報，申報以及偽外交部參加日本慶典，與偽駐日大使館工作報告各卷宗，爲其所憑之證據，并說明實行所辯出任偽職，由於被迫之詞，係屬託諸空言，其謂發表言論，非出本意，亦顯屬飾詞，所稱保護陵園之事，係其偽市長職務上應盡之責任，供給情報，旣未實施，亦無效力可言，營救地下工作人員，不過偶徇一二友人之請，激於感情之衝動，其他救災恤病，即令實有其事，亦無非奉行狡敵籠絡我國人民之政策，均與利國利民之法意毫不相涉，不足爲惑刑之理由等情，認爲係犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項款，通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之罪，固無不合。惟查實行參加偽組織，係由於失去國府內政部民政司司長之地位，而不及隨同政府西遷，而其出任偽職後，在梁逆鴻志與汪逆兆銘合組偽國府之後，不思伺機潛入後方，效命中央，而始終依附敵偽，歷任偽職，未能解免其謀叛罪責，然較之蓄意藉敵人武力，以顛覆我政府爲目的之元惡大憝，情形自有差別。而對於國父陵園，交涉撤退日方駐兵，組織警衛隊以爲保護，雖屬其偽市市長應行之職務，尚不無欽仰崇高偉大國父之微忱。其與徐明誠接洽供給中央情報，及營救協助中央地下工作人員馬元放，陳力行，王文俊之事，旣經證人鄧潔存，俞龐蓉，王文俊到案證明，并有徐明誠，馬元放，陳力行之函件可憑，雖供給情報，未見實行，而營救抗戰工作人員，核其經過，亦非完全感情衝動。就此斟酌，雖不能予以末減，而衡量情罪，尚非不可貸其一死，原判決以處死刑，自嫌稍重，應由本院撤銷，就法定本刑內政處無期徒刑，以昭矜慎。聲請及辯護意旨攻擊原審，對於被告有利之事項，未盡調查職責，其適用法律，不參酌處理漢奸案件條例第三條及司法院院字第三一〇一號解釋之法意，係屬違法等語，固屬無足采取，而其指摘原判處刑過重，要非全無理由。據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第廿二條第一項前段，懲治漢奸條例第一條，第二條第一項第一款，第八條第一項，第九條，刑法第二條第一項前段，第三十七條第一項，判決如主文。</p>

<h3>生產貸款審核委員會　昨決定兩大要點</h3>
<p>工礦事業舊欠可不在新貸中扣除　如對商業行莊負債則須自行商洽</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕生產事業貸款臨時審核委員會，於昨日下午四時，假中行大厦四樓，召開第四次例會，到委員廿餘人。席間四因主任委員霍寳樹赴京，由常務委員李馥蓀，擔任臨時主席。討論要案多起，會後發表兩點：（一）各工礦事業向生產貸款會申請貸款時，如在各國家行局，原巳獲有貸款者，該項舊欠，可不在新貸款中扣除。（二）凡在商業行莊有舊欠者，應由各申請貸款者，與各商業行莊，自行商妥解決辦法，再陳由生產貸款會核定云。</p>
<p>又該會對生產事業貸款之利率，業經決定，國家行局及商業行莊承放款，一律爲月息四分。</p>
<p>據該會規程第七條之規定「中央銀行對於各行局憑核定條款貸放之案件，應隨時承做抵押」，茲悉該會第三次例會決定，凡國家行局向中央銀行轉抵押時，按實放額八折計算，利率爲月息二分八厘，商業行莊向中央銀行轉抵押時，亦按實放額八折計算，利率爲月息二分。</p>
<p>以上述戡定之轉抵押利率則國家行局貸放生產車貸款，其實得利息爲月息八分八厘，商業行莊爲月息一角二分。</p>

<h3>紡建副總經理吳昧經談　改良和推廣植棉的步驟</h3>
<p>外棉進口現爲我國最大的漏洞　改善生產三年後可以恢復舊觀</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕棉花本是我國特產之一，拿我國戰前每年的生產量而言，已經可以自足自給。而紡織組支紗的棉花，還能供給出口而有餘。可是八年抗（戰，農村遭受了澈底的破壞。棉花的正常生產量，首當其衝。去年的不必談了，今年全國的生產量，照可靠的估計，是七日萬但。可是，實際可供各紗廠收購紡紗的數量，是微之又微。於是退而求决，只得仰仗於外棉的進口了。試看一年來海關逐月發表的進口貨值，那一個月下是原棉佔了首位數量之大，更非其他進口貨所能望其項背。據確切的估計：民國卅五年度全國進口總值美金六億五千餘萬元中，單是原棉一項，就佔到美金一億六干餘萬元。這是一筆怎樣驚人的外匯漏洞！所以改進植棉計劃，提倡原棉增產運動，實屬刻不容緩。因爲這個計劃的實現，它所完成的使命是多方面的。它解決了大部份的農村經濟問題，它替我國節省了一筆最龐大的外匯支出，它更解決了全國人民消耗量最大的棉布底原料問題。</p>
<p>記者懷着這個前提，和現任中國舫建公司副總經理吳味經先生，作了一次漫長的談話。吳先生是研究棉花貿易和棉業產銷的專家。自從早年畢業於天津棉業專門學校後，半生的精力，就全傾注在棉業的改進事業上。他足跡遍歷我國和日本朝鮮等地的產棉區。從脚踏實地，和實際的體騐中，來找到他改進計劃的根據。</p>
<p>黃河流域　世界最理想的植棉地區</p>
<p>吳先生說得好，拿天氣和土質言，世界上恐怕再也找不到有較黃河流域更理想的植棉環境了那裏一到秋天，就覺天高氣爽，地土又多屬沙壤質，結出來的棉鈴，最見肥大。再如長江流域，也是理想的植棉區，不過氣候上沒有黃河流域那麼乾燥罷了。終之，我國的植棉區，南可至海南島，北可直叩關外，東北，瀋陽，東達海濱，西至四川。所以全國除了蒙疆和西南多山地區之外，幾乎沒有一塊地不適宜於植棉。</p>
<p>戰前產量　民十六年以后進步最快</p>
<p>從整個農業說起來，我國改良農業，已有四十多年歷史。而時至今日，最著成績者，首推棉花。從生產量方面說，據民國八年紗廠聯合會的記載，那時我國每年產棉估計是老秤三百萬担，到抗戰前夕，這數字已膨脹到老秤一千四百餘萬担。此中特別以民國十六年到廿六年的十年間，遞增允速。品質方面，也從最初的十支紗原料，陸續進步到抗戰前夕時的四十二支乃至六十支紗原料。這種質量上的進步，原因不外：（一）紡織事業突飛猛晋。（二）法幣政策的推行。（三）我國消費棉布量的龐大。（四）我國植棉區之遼闊。</p>
<p>雲南木棉　外國譽之爲我國寶產</p>
<p>產棉區域，除了黃河長江兩流域外，其他值得注意的區域有三處：一是雲南的木棉。這種木棉，和廣東所產的截然不同。富於撚曲性，有拉力，可紡六十支紗。最大的特點，就是它是多年生的植物。一年下種，第三年起，年年可收獲兩次。一次在六七月間，一次在十一十二兩月間。這批棉花，以雲南開遠附近所產最多，每年可產二三千但。外人且譽爲我國的寳產。現在正有政府和民間合資組織的雲南木棉公司，在那裏開發繁殖。二是海島棉，生產在海南島上，可說是世界上最優良的棉花了。這種棉花，和美國弗羅立達州和墨西哥　兩地所產的差不多。纖維細而長，可供紡二百至二百四十支的西紗。現在正在試種期中。三是西河和孝感兩地的組絨。這種棉花，是世界上最粗最硬的棉花，最適宜和羊毛交織地氈。戰前每年出口常達二三十萬担。如果能繁殖增產，以供外銷，則每年所能掙回的外匯，也是相當可觀的。</p>
<p>馴化美種　目前我國已有相當成就</p>
<p>其次談到棉花的試驗和推廣辦法大致可分兩種：一是育種，就是選纖維長，產量多的優種棉花，待其成熟開花時，施行人工交配手術，不使與劣種混亂，然後逐漸使之繁殖擴充。另一種是選種，就是選擇特別優良的棉種，使與其他棉花隔離，而另擇地段保育繁殖起來。我國目前大多是採取第二種辦法，選買優良的美國棉種，設法馴化一下，然後加以繁殖。</p>
<p>我國採用第二種辦怯繁殯後，目前最優良的品種有三：第一種是斯民第四號棉（StoneVille　No.4），自黃河流域起，至天津保定的緯度爲止，都適於種植這種品種。它的特點：（一）纖維長達一吋，可紡卅二支至四十二支的棉紗。（二）籽的平徑達一寸又卅二分之一。（三）產量高。（四）成熟早。（五）衣分極高，一百斤籽花，可軋皮花卅三斤左右。所以華北地帶，這品種就給大量的繁殖起來。第二種是德氏第五三一號棉（DelfosNo.　531）。這種品種在長江流域，已立下了基礎。而尤以本年試種結果，成績更爲顯著。它的特點：（一）纖維長達一吋又十六分之一，可紡四十二支至六十二支的棉紗。（二）產量亦高。（三）衣分亦佳。不過長江流域氣候比較潮濕，每年適於種雨季，惟時間稍嫌逼促。現在尚在試種中，大量生產，有待來年。第三種是關農一號，產地自冀東以北，以迄於遼河流域一帶。這種品種，是日本人所培植出來的。它的特點：（一）纖維長達百分之七吋，可紡廿支至卅二支的棉紗。（二）成孰特早。可前我國的改良棉花品種，以上述的三種爲最主要。</p>
<p>改良推廣　吳氏計劃中分三個步驟</p>
<p>最後吳先生搬出他個人對改良和推廣我國棉花的三部曲來。第一步是應該在全國各產棉地區，設立一原稱塲。據他估計，全國應有原種塲二十處以上。每塲的週圍，應建一繁殖塲，使成爲波浪形的擴大形勢。第二步應實行集中軋花。這樣一來，可减少種籽混亂的機會，皮花也可保持整齊一致。這種辦法，特別是日本人在東北行之而有特效。它可使壞籽逐漸淘汰，使品種趨於純粹。故凡屬改良棉花之區，都應設立機器　花廠，同時附設打包廠，榨油廠等，以利工作的進行。、種籽和皮花經過以上兩種步驟處理後，最後一步，是要把棉花檢騐分級，使棉花品質標準化。這一步如做不到，則國棉將永無辦法善價而沽。</p>
<p>以上的三部曲計劃，如能迎買實現，則估計三年內，我國棉花的生產量，至少可恢復到抗戰前夕時的狀態。本年因爲復員尚未完成，所以對植棉而言，只能稱爲準備年，大致產量可達七百萬担。明年繼續準備，大致可遞增到九百萬祖。民國卅七年可望遞增到一千三百萬担，民國卅八年可望達到戰前的水準，大致是一千七百萬担。果如時局趨靖，則配合這三部曲後，一千七百萬祖的棉花生產量，三年後應該是絕對可辦到的事。</p>
<p>完成計劃　必先解決下列幾個條件</p>
<p>然而，要達成這三部曲，吳先生認爲以下的幾個先決條件，是必待解決的：（一）經費問題：紡建公司取諸於棉紡事業之利攔　仍望還諸於棉防事業。特別要提出一大部分經費，供改進棉花之用，才可使農業工業化，多多利用機械耕種灌溉。一方面節省人力，一方面可大規模生產。才可達到提高品質，减低生產成本的　的。（二）應大量培植人材。留學國外，固屬需要，國內也同時要大量織植中級的幹部人材。（三）應大量採購美國的優良品種，以備大規模的繁殖。（四）應設立一個全國性的改進棉業機構，以氣候及土質的殊異，劃分爲區。各區再視需要，設若干指導所。以此三級機構，分担改進和擴充棉業的工作，想來已綽有餘裕了。</p>
<p>這是吳先生改進我國棉業計劃的一個梗概，吳先生是一個主張從實際經騐，以找到他計劃根據的人。所以他的計劃，比起一般理論的改進計間，應該是更切實而更進一步的。他在本年秋季，才廣泛地視察東北，黃河流域，平漢路，以及長江流域一帶的植棉區城歸來。他替我國的產棉情況，帶回來一個樂觀的前瞻。願明年秋高氣爽的日子，記者能親自目賭，全國沃野千里，都成爲一望無垠的棉花圃！</p>

<p>上海足球裁判會會員，以會長鄂森榮任日本國際法庭顧問新職，特於昨晚七時，假南京西路康樂酒家設宴歡送，到有會員卅餘人，席聞由理事長吳守衡致歡送詞後，鄂會長致謝詞。裁判會自鄂會長出國辭職後，昨日歡送會上，經全體會員推定譚敬繼任，預料該會在譚氏主持下，定有更良好收獲，歡送會在熱烈情緒巾，至九時許始散。</p>
<h3>元旦日在滬美軍　舉行橄欖球義賽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍在上海每年一度的橄欖球賽，將於明年元旦日下午二時，在逸園比賽，票價每張四千元，將於下星期一在下列各地開始發售：（一）北京路二路五樓五一〇室，（二）南京路一二六號，（三）百老匯大厦，（四）四川路西靑年會，（五）福州路美軍俱樂部，（六）跑馬廳美軍體育部，（七）滬西哥倫比亞俱樂部，（八）華懋大樓。按此每年一度之美軍橄欖球賽，（China　Bowl　Football）售票收入陰開銷外，全部盈餘，將捐爲在華美海軍之福利基金。故除在塲服有職務者外，無諭美陸海軍官佐士兵或行政人員，均需購票入塲。當球賽進行時，由無綫電向全市廣播，並同時向菲律賓·日本·華北轉播。</p>
<h3>精武杯乒乓賽　楊開運力取　第五組冠軍</h3>
<p>各組冠亞軍十人　將再舉行總決賽</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕精武杯乒乓個人錦標賽，最後一組，於昨晚七時，假慈淑三樓精武會所舉行，結果楊開運反敗爲勝，奪得冠軍，馮浩竟爲冷門之陳曾亮擊敗，亞軍席决，只好拱手相讓。</p>
<p>楊開運首逢陳曾亮，以手術生疏，以二比一敗北。陳曾亮當時，巳以三比〇輸予馮浩，故楊開運與馮浩之戰，實爲重要關頭。楊球風大轉，以三比一大勝馮浩，形盛三角局勢，於是由總裁判陳霖笙決定，以抽簽方式，再採淘汰決賽，楊聞運輸空，馮陳激戰時，均以決賽權之得失，在此一局，故多穩紮穩打，而取守勢，然以馮浩火氣較大，於採取攻勢之時，失球累累，終致落選。楊聞運再戰陳曾亮，楊以逸代勞，遂　　首敗之恥，而取得末組冠軍。各人勝負結果如下：楊開運勝五，冠軍，陳會亮勝四，負一，亞軍，馮浩勝三，負二，蔣柏泉勝二，負三，朱匡臣勝一，負四，注宗澤負五。</p>
<p>五組冠距軍十人，將定期再舉行單循環總決賽。時間地點，將由競賽委員會，與裁判委員會，下星期一午後五特，假精武會所，舉行聯席會頗決定之。各組冠亞軍如下：</p>
<p>組別　冠軍　亞軍</p>
<p>一·　王友信　陳興權</p>
<p>二·　張孚　　范良</p>
<p>三·　張善　　水　高</p>
<p>四·　李震　胡一萍</p>
<p>五·　楊開運　陳曾亮</p>
<h3>甲組足球第二循環　東華今日戰猶太　下午二時半在逸園球塲</h3>
<p>足球聯賽，上週因雨停賽一週，今日賡續交鋒，僅甲組第二循環一塲，東華再逢猶太於逸園裁判陳吉祥，巡邊負責黃仁彝·鄧效　，門票二千及五千元。</p>
<p>東華因莊友仁赴厦门，故由老將李寗出任左後衛，餘無變動，該隊此番在聯賽中，五戰五勝，首循中初遇猶太，以三比一告捷今日富可再挫黑馬。</p>
<p>大批義將　參加猶太</p>
<p>猶太黑馬，　來雖得義將西拉　·飽傑·及鐵門麥尼蒂助陣，但演出鬆懈，屢遭敗績，殊爲可怪，此番除全部精銳出動外，並另邀義將亞托馬利及包瑪出任前鋒，實力陡增，屆時與東華一番龍爭虎鬥，大有可觀。雙方陣綫如下：</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>張邦倫　李寗　張林根</p>
<p>韓龍渡　鐔福楨　於洽興</p>
<p>李垚　孫錦順　戴麟經　韓龍海　賈幼良　陳明哲</p>

<h3>鐵路小型球賽　機務逼和運務</h3>
<p>鐵路處際小型球比賽，昨日機務運務會師，雙方實力相等，上半時各無紀錄。再戰聲中，雙方競爭愈烈，戰局至爲緊張，時間完畢，機務逼和運務，鴨蛋一雙。按鐵路球塲太小，觀衆擁擠，裁判照顧或有不及，希雙方球員及觀衆注意運動精神，及球塲秩序。</p>

<p>憲法草案</p>
<p>第一審委會審查報告</p>
<p>甲，本會審查之範圍</p>
<p>本審查委員會所審查之範圍，係奉父之中華民國憲法草案「前言」及第一章「總綱」，目第一條至第七條。第二章「人民之權利義務」，第八條至第二十五條，第十二章「選舉」第一百二十八條至第一百三十二條。</p>
<p>乙，審查之參考材料</p>
<p>本審查委員會所參考之材料，爲有關提案一百二十二件，及代表發言彙編兩册，及參加本審查委員會委員之意見。</p>
<p>丙，審查之時間及會議次數</p>
<p>本審查委員會之開始審查，爲十二月六日。審查會之地址爲勵志社大禮堂。此後開會六次，均在中央黨部會議廳，共計開會七次，至本月十四日十二時半完畢。</p>
<p>在各審查會中，對於所交審查各條，各審查委員均聚精會神，致力研討，除第一條因有人持有異議，及第七條因國都問題爭議甚烈，己分別移送綜合委員會審查。關於有修正者或爭論較多者分別說明如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於「前言」</p>
<p>關於「前言」，各審查委員發言甚多，有主張「依據」兩字爲失之不恭，如公文上之用語嘗用「據某某呈稱，」故應改爲「遵奉」兩字，經辯論甚久，後經旅委員知本之解釋，例如「依於仁，據於德，游於藝。」均非以上對下，「依據」與「據」不同。又有主張，</p>
<p>孫中山先生之上，應冠以「國父」兩字者，更有主張，應將「創造中華民國」之六字，置於孫中山先生之上者，結果經付表決，以在塲一百五十七人，仍以一百二十七票之多數通過維持通過原案。</p>
<p>（二）關於第一條</p>
<p>本條係關係國體之規定，各代表極爲重視，所提之修正案計三十二條，而各審查委員之發言極踴躍，有主張將三民主義四字除掉者，如李代表俊夫夏代表爾康等，有主張修正爲「中華民國爲三民主義共和國者」人數甚多，其所持之理由，三民主義即爲民主主義，更有其他審議意見甚多，討論時間甚久歸納五案提付表決，當時在塲人數爲一百廿九人。</p>
<p>（一）中華民國爲民主共國贊成者十一票</p>
<p>（二）中華民國爲三民主義統一民主共和國贊成者無票。</p>
<p>（三）中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國贊成者五十八集</p>
<p>（四）中華民國爲三民主義共和國贊成者四十八票</p>
<p>（五）中華民國基於三民主義爲民主共和國贊成者二十六票</p>
<p>結果除中華民國爲三民主義統一民主共和國，無贊成者不計外，其餘四案亦均不足法定票數，當時已屆散會時間，並有「中華民國爲基於三民主義民主共和國」修正案之提議。於下午網續開會後，乃依議事規則第五十一條之規定，再信審查，經討論後，復將已經表決前六案贊成票較多兩案表決，其結果如下：</p>
<p>（一）中華民國爲基於三民主義之民主共和國贊成者三十三票</p>
<p>（二）中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國贊成者一百零七票</p>
<p>綜計本條表決結果修正爲「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國。」</p>
<p>（三）關於第四條</p>
<p>本條關於領土之規定有主張列舉者，有主張維持原案者，有主張記明國界者，結果皆以爲列舉雖有其利亦有其弊，但多數以爲國土之變更，仍以經國民大會之決議較爲有利，並以槪括規定爲宜，當時以在塲人數一百二十九人以七十八票通過修正案條文爲「中華民國領土依其固有之疆域，非經國民大會之決議，不得變更之。」</p>
<p>（四）關於第七條</p>
<p>本條爲國都之規定，關係至大，各代表對本條之提案凡廿一案，對於本條之發言引經據典頗多精關，就中以主張定都北平者爲數最多，本條之討論經十一日十二日兩次之熱烈辯論，最後將本條修正案一一付諸表決，當時在塲人數爲一百九十二人表決結果如下</p>
<p>（一）删去原文對於苜都不加規定於憲法者贊成者六十七票</p>
<p>（二）中華民國國都定於南京北平西安三處爲原則，按建國需要分別行之贊成者七票</p>
<p>（三）中華民國以蘭州爲中都，南京爲東都，以疏勒爲西都贊成者十二票</p>
<p>（四）中華民國國都定都於蘭州贊成者七票</p>
<p>（五）中華民國國都定都於西安贊成者七票</p>
<p>（六）中華民國國都定都於武漢贊成者九票</p>
<p>（七）中華民國國都於北平計贊成者一百一十七票</p>
<p>本條即修正爲中華民國國都定於北平，而本案決定以後主張維持原案之人要求將維持原案再付表決結果贊成維特原案者六十三人，仍以中華民國國都定都於北平之修正案通過</p>
<p>（五）關於第九條</p>
<p>本條係規定對人權之保障，本委員會之各委員咸以爲必爲縝密之審查，否則不足以保護人權之周延，經長時間之討論各委員之意見甚多，更有主張本條之設，應將二十四條删除者否則爲對本條之限制，恐人民仍不能獲充分之保障。亦有主張應顧及治安事實等問題，不能限制政府如此之嚴苟者：結果爲審愼計，乃推定張知本，何基鴻，紀淸漪，牟震東，奏聯奎五人爲本條條文整理員，經整理後，乃於本次會下午繼續會開會時通過修正案草文如下：</p>
<p>「人民身體自由，應予保障，除現行犯之逮捕，由法律另定外；非經司法或警察機關，依法定程序，不得逮捕拘禁。非由法院依法定程序之逮捕拘禁審問處罰，得拒絕之。</p>
<p>人民因犯罪嫌疑被逮捕拘禁時，其逮捕拘禁機關應將逮捕拘禁原因，以書面告知本人及其本人指定之親友。並至遲於二十四小時內移送該管法院審問，本人或他人亦得聲請該管法院於二十四小時內向逮捕之機關提審。</p>
<p>法院對於前項聲請，不得拒絕，並不得先令逮捕拘禁之機關查覆。逮捉拘禁之機關，對於怯院之提審，不得担絕或遲延。</p>
<p>人民遭受任何機關非法逮捕拘禁時，其本人或他人得向法院聲請追究，法院不得拒絕。並應於二十四小時內，向逮捕拘禁之機關追究，依怯處理。」</p>
<p>當時在塲人數爲一二一人無異議通過</p>
<p>（六）關於第十六條</p>
<p>本條原草案係關於人民財產權之規定，經討論時，咸以爲人民之財產權，固應保障；然對於無財產者之生存權及工作權，亦應並加保障。否則本憲法僅保護有財產者之財產，實屬有遠民生主義之精神，及成爲偏重保護資查階級之流弊，因而將本條修正爲「人民之生存權工作權財產權應予保障。」當時在塲人數八十八人，以七十一票通過修正案。</p>
<p>（七）關於第二十一條</p>
<p>本條爲國民應服兵役之規定，唯白代表祟禧等之修正案，認爲國防除兵役之外，尚有服工役之必要，經審查時多數以爲甚當，唯審查委員中多覺人民因服兵役工役而致殘廢死傷情事，國家亦應負救濟撫卹之責任，乃識決本條修正爲「人民有依法律服兵役及工役之義務」並增加第二項條文如次「人民因服其役工役而致疾病殘廢或死亡者，國家對其本人或家屬，應予適當之救濟或撫郵」當時在塲人數八十二人以五十三票通過修正。</p>
<p>（八）關於第十二章選舉</p>
<p>本章爲關於選舉之規定，在審查時，多以爲不合已通過之原憲法草案第十八條條文「人民有選舉罷免創制複決之權」之規定，本章草案僅規定選舉，實爲疏漏，關於罷免權僅規定於第一百三十二條，亦嫌不足。本章軍名名爲選舉亦應修正，於通過原草案至第一百二十八條至第一百三十二條以後，復依第三六六號提案，林代表彬等之修正案，通過修正本章章名爲選舉罷免創制複決。條文增加第一百三十三條「罷免，須經原選舉區域機關內選舉權人四分一以上提出，用投票方法，取決於過半數之同意」。第一百三十四條」創制權之行使，依事項之性質與繁簡，以左列方法之一爲之：一，制成法律案。二，制成法律原則」。第一百三十五條「依第一百三十四條制成之怯律案，應送政府立法機關完成立怯程序；制定立法原則，應由立法機關，依照原則制定法律，或規章，均須送經政府公布」第一百三十六條「複決除本憲法有規定者外，有左列事由之一時爲之：一，廢止一定法律或規章。二，變更立法機關關於一完法律案所爲不成立之決議」。第一百三十七條「複決以後，方法行之，除怯律有規定者外，取決於複決權人過半之同意」。</p>
<p>本章之修正案，在場人數六十五人以三十九票之過半數通過。</p>
<p>又本章有附帶說明者即原草第一百二十八條討論時，有夏代表爾康，極力主張修正本條，採用大選舉區比例選舉制，雖亦有代表附議，多數終以爲此制不合於現情之中國。被否決，但夏代表仍聲明保留其發言權。</p>
<p>第一審查委員會召集人張知本　黃少谷　夏爾康　李俊夫　陳逸雲　着一山　祁志原任卓宣　劉瑤章</p>

<p>經歷次會議進行中凡遇重大議題正反雙方意見距隊過遠時召集人及若干代表曾提議將雙方不同意見一併記明送由綜合審查委員會處理未獲通過故皆採用表決方式取决於多數。</p>

<h3>蘇聯的藝術荒蘇　女作家盧比莎的批評</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>國人往往以爲蘇聯的文藝全是新型的，而有着一種前進的氣象；事實上卻不盡然。至少在藝術方面，它是有些落伍的。現代的新藝術，不論繪畫，彫刻，在蘇聯往往不能存在，一般前進畫家，在蘇聯根本沒有立足的機會，這已是世人所共知的事實。所以他們的天才只有到國外，尤其是藝術之都的巴黎去發展。例如世界聞名的康丁斯蓋（Kandinsky），以及「巴黎畫派」的翹楚夏伽耳（Mare　Chagall），蘇汀（Chin　Soutine）等人，都是蘇籍的畫家，可是在蘇聯本國受着種種限制，感到苦悶，遂毅然決然的離別了祖國，而投奔到世界藝術的中心地——巴黎去。應用着他們不　的胸懷，完成了至高的抱負，成爲現代藝術界中的第一流偉才。而蘇聯本土則呈現出藝術荒的。到了今日，藝術在蘇聯，已不能獨立，而成爲政府的一種宣傳工具，更不爲一般前進的藝人所樂道的了。</p>
<p>最近，在美國出版了一本關於蘇聯藝術的論著，書名爲「俄羅斯之藝術」，作者是八年前到美國去的一個蘇聯女作家海倫盧比莎（Helen　Rubissow），她常住紐約，專門從事藝術批評的著述，已不再作歸鄉之計。盧女士原是俄國聖彼得堡藝術學院畢業的高材生。在她這本著作裏共有插圖一百六十幀，其中一半是現代蘇聯作家的代表作品，一半是許多流亡於國外而被世界公認爲成名作家的俄籍作家的作品，對照起來，很顯明的暴露出所謂「現代蘇聯的藝術」是怎樣的被限制而至水準低落的程度。</p>
<p>盧女士在這書中說：「自從十月革命以後，新興藝術在蘇聯生存的時期殊爲短促。列寗在一九二一年的革命宣言中，對於左翼的現代藝術家的作品，指爲「幼稚」。自此宣言發表後，一般真正前進的文學家及畫家，都不約而同的先後脫離了祖國，而到歐西去發展他們的能力了。」</p>
<p>她又說：「蘇聯當時蓬勃的新興藝壇，不啻澆上了冷水，一般藝人深深的感到不習慣於種種苛刻的限制和拘束。當政府方面所要提倡的是恢復昔日死板的，陳規的所謂學院派的繪畫，而一般感染到新思想的作家，要是不出國，對於繪畫莫不無精打采的無心製作。他們旣不歡喜慕倣，而創作又被限制，不可能獲得自由發揮的機會，於是逼得許多作家索性拋棄畫具，不彈此調了。」</p>
<p>時過境遷，到了史太林統治以後，甘願被政府御用的畫家雖與日俱增。史太林竭力提倡所謂「　　的現實主義」。然而這些所謂「　　的現實主義」的繪畫又是些什麼呢？據盧女士說：「不過是些十九世紀遺留下來的「情操主義」的傳述故事罷了。他們的題材，不外乎母親抱着孩子，孤苦地踏過鋪滿着白雪的原野；要不然就是一個年青女子和她的幼兒在感傷地注視着殘垣敗壁；或者是一羣婦女在看着士兵們在英勇的作戰。到最近，也有畫着女人們看坦克在史太林格勒衝鋒殺敵的場面。」</p>
<p>她還說：「……蘇聯限制藝術家工作範圍是這樣：凡是一張作品的內容（包括色彩和構圖）不符合政府的主義與主題時，該作家就會被政府傳去申斥甚至處罰。作家的作品是經常有人在暗地裏調查的。而每一作家必需絕對的對政府負責，作家本身是絕無絲毫自由的。」</p>
<p>像這被管制的藝術，宜乎其不能與世界藝術相接近了。現代的藝術，以「巴黎畫派」做代表，是一種表現作家修個性，理想和靈魂的藝術。從這一方面來看，蘇聯的藝術若確如盧女士所說，則還在十九世紀的中葉兜圈子，充其量把它比做當時英國的「辣斐耳前派」的作品是足够了。（節譯自自美國時代週報）</p>
<h3>周湘畫譜引言</h3>

<h3>蕭伯納</h3>
<p>— 幹四</p>
<p>蕭伯納曾在非洲住過。某次他正在一個池裏游泳，真是優哉游哉。當時還有許多小孩也在游泳，他們完全不認識這位堂堂的大作家。其中有一個小孩，他的游伴們慫恿他去將「那個老頭子的頭撳到水裏去。」并且用一個先令的酬報來引誘他。</p>
<p>那小孩接受了他們的條件，就游了開去，向蕭氏正在懶散地划着水的地方面來。可是當他逼近這老人的時候，他突然恐懼起來。蕭氏掉過頭來，看見這小孩，便問他來幹什麼。</p>
<p>這小孩子完全失去了他的胆量，被老人一問，他竟格格不吐地將他們打賭的事情全盤說了出來。蕭氏厲色向這小孩望了一眼，然後說道：「好，要是你等候一回，讓我透一口氣，那末我可以讓你把我的頭撳到水裏去，」</p>
<p>他們這樣做了以後，那小孩就很快樂地游回去收入他的先令了。</p>
<h3>俳句</h3>

<p>壯闊雄大的情事宜宣之以長篇大章的史詩，一剎即逝的感興須留之以寥寥數字的俳句，小學生道：「寫大字，用大筆；寫小字，用小筆，」此之謂「內容決定形式！」</p>
<p>日本有所謂俳詩，而小林一茶，芭蕉蕪村之流是其中的作家名手，雖然知之不詳俳詩究該是怎樣的一種東西，私意以爲大槪即是否國之所謂小詩耳。效顰之外，連名稱也大膽竊取過來了。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　128</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>圓子是受過特務訓練的，不同其她女子，所以一到近衛這個機密府邸之後，不到幾個星期，早把府中的佈置，一一收入眼詆。此外，該聯絡的人物聯絡了，該明白的事情明白了；當然做得一絲不着痕跡。據她的調查，近衛這個地方，乃是他的別府，竟是一個機要機關，舉凡國家大事，機密會所，重要文件，都集中在這別府中辦理。只有他的親信，和手下特務工作人員，才能進出。在「七七事件」前一年內，因有秘密條件關係，所以又加入了第五縱隊的蹤跡。這些第五縱隊與近衛之間，全靠一種所謂「微妙」關係維持着；名義上是他個人的僱員，担任着顧問，侍衛，翻譯，等等；實底上，這些人就是他和希歷之間的聯絡橋樑。這座橋樑的中堅份子之一，專門担任特務的，就是那位獨眼紳士，聽說名呌　底微沙登。</p>
<p>只是日人有一種特性，儘管你是他的親信，同他共着生死的機密，只要你是一個外國人，不是天皇的御民，他同你的關係，只能維持着八九分，無論如何，他要保留下一二分。好比他這座別府建築，那人　辦公會議等等地方，第五縱隊重要人物，都可穿進穿出，惟有鸛見晋謁的那座日本廳屋，就要謝絕參觀，就令獨眼沙登，也不得越雷池一步。</p>
<p>這樣，豈不是呌這些同盟的第五縱隊不開心嗎？那又不然，因個個日本大人動閥之流，都有「寡人之疾」，他對第五縱隊說明這「御用區」，乃是他玩娘兒們的一座巫山陽台，不含政治作用，所以要「貴賓止步」。本來這裏面，也只是一些蝴蝶夫人型的女身，侍應伺候；就連那個私人秘書，也只走到第一重門止步哩。</p>
<p>如此看來，近衛這座別府，本身已經够秘密了，誰知還有內外圈子之分。俗話說，「矮子肚裏疙瘩多」，無怪近衛這裏竟有秘密之中的秘密區域。然而僅僅這內外兩重圈子的區分，就算矮子的疙瘩嗎？不。據圓子的探索，就在近衛那矮榻後面，右手也是他的臥室。這裏僅有侍妾中的「機要侍妾」才能進來，尤其那間書房，不是當職的侍妾，沒有命令，竟不許多走一步。這是內層圈子的內層。</p>
<p>圓子在內層子圈子內，活動了很多時，費了不少心機，在建築的牆外測量，在矮榻後面的屏風上，裝置了收音機，又乘機曾冒險探索，發現秘密電流昇壓器裝置，空氣流通裝置，又沒法統計內外耗用的電流，這才斷定這座書房中，還有很堅固很大型的地下室。</p>
<p>當初，第一次歐戰的第一戰犯，德皇威廉第二，就有一個設備最精密，布置最完備的地下室，作爲發動世界大戰的神經中樞，每天夜午以後，他同他的特務首領，就在這裏，收聽世界秘密報告，指揮手下在各國進行秘密工作。日本最最喜歡模仿德國，所以近衛也弄下了這麼一個地下室　，一面進行機密工作，一面還可用作意料以外的防空室。所謂意料以外，因爲日人當初就認爲外國飛機，絕對不能到日本本土來轟炸的這回事。</p>
<p>可是，近衛又不是一個永遠性的內閣總理，這種佈置，似乎過分秘密了，一旦下台，有何用處？不知近衛除了內閣的地位之外，他把握着兩三種秘密團社的運用，黑龍會就是其中之一；另外，因他有些「御血統」關係，因而又是「天潢修永」社的中堅人物。在侵略大陸，吞併東亞，和德人平分世界的霸權之後，然後再同德人來一個兩雄不并立的火併，爭霸全世界，等等一連串的陰謀大計上，近衛乃是伊籐博文，大畏伯，以來，承統的機要份子——秘密虫——之一。憑高一點點關係；每條秘密虫還能不佈置下道們小小一個機要地下室？</p>

<h3>南北</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>據北平友人來信稱，各大學中南北同學之爭，如火如茶，繼北大三院之後，淸華大學日前亦展開南北同學之佈告戰。</p>
<p>我們不敢武斷這是從國民大會中都京都平之爭所蔓延，但不可否認是有其影饗的。</p>
<p>定都問題自然不是地域觀念所出發，可是看了淸華同學的質詢和答復，其中不免有意氣用事之處了。比如，南方同學質問；</p>
<p>（一）周逆作人，錢逆稻孫爲何受國法制裁？</p>
<p>（二）敵偽時代，敵人何以對偽大學學生配發麵粉？</p>
<p>（三）爾等爲何不到內地？</p>
<p>北方同學答覆：</p>
<p>（一）周作人，錢稻孫因漢奸而受國法制裁。</p>
<p>（二）如因北方同學未去內地而爲漢奸，則一度被滿淸統治之全中國人民皆爲漢奸；爾等何能例外？</p>
<p>（三）敵偽配發麵粉，並未專以學生爲對象。雨×爾×如未去內地，則亦曾領用：依邏緝原理，爾×爾×亦爲漢奸。</p>
<p>這樣持續下去，很容易傷感情，而節外生校闖出別的毛病出來的。</p>
<p>探討眞理，求是非，尤其是在學校裏，我們不反對論辯，如果越出正軌，一味攻訐，那就有失研究的風度了。</p>
<p>京滬各大學倒還沒有此等現象，希望將來也別發生。南方之强也，北方之强也，大家都是中國人罷而言之，一致努力使整個中國富强爲上。</p>
<h3>上海交通　故態復萌</h3>
<p>— 文乎</p>
<p>上海的交通現在又到了混亂的狀態了，自從上决實行交通管制以來，混亂的情形似乎好了一點，而大部的交通警察又多肯賣力，可是現在又恢復了「常態」，發了從前的「老脾氣」，而交通警們的熱心，似乎已隨漆在街頭的黃色「行人通過錢」一樣的淡掉了。</p>
<p>在上次交通管制的規則裏就有一條「空車不准侵入中區」的條文，可是現在我們隨時隨地可以在中區看見空的人力車，三輪車在駕駛着，和停在不該停放的地方；當然這些空車對於車輛的通行自然有相雷的阻顱的。</p>
<p>最可怪的却是浙江路橋忽　地禁止卡車，人力車，三輪軍通過了。這部份不准通過的車輪，自然他們都集中到西藏路橋來，以致弄得北蘇州路和北西藏路水洩不通，一輛汽車在擁擠的時候，從此蘇州路由西藏路橋而達到泥城橋這一點短短的路程，就非一小時不辦，有時還要超過。</p>
<p>最近北西藏路和北蘇州路的交通秩序是異常的混亂的，尤在午後就差不多到了「半身不遂」的狀態了。現在讓我把道些擴編擁塞的惰形寫在下面：</p>
<p>每日午後至六時左右，北蘇州路目文昌路口至西藏路橋，再至泥城橋，是最擁塞的地方，遇到這洩不通的時候，所有的車輛一步也不能移動。有一次我開了窗，看見西藏路橋上停滿了擁塞的車輛，一動也不動，滿以爲出了事情，可是幷不如此，却是車輛擁塞得週轉不靈，進退兩難，那天的車輛就從橋口一直排到北蘇州路的農民銀行倉庫，人力車三輛車排得允長，黑壓壓的人頭，和戲院裏的觀衆一樣，三輪車人力車走到這種路上來當然大喊倒霉，因爲一小時的時間可達到目的地的，現在却需二三小時，那些性急的乘客自然不耐久等，便付了車資「安步常車」了。有許多從北站開來的出差汽車，看看風頭不對，大都向後轉，繞別的路而走了。這雖不是天天如此的情形，我放說十天之內就有八天是如此。</p>
<p>不過一河之隔的浙江路橋，却是十分悠閑的，除了幾輛電車和小汽車而外就沒有什麼車輛了。據說浙江路橋禁止三輪車，人力車和卡車通過的原因，是因爲三輪車在橋上和電車相撞過，所以爲了「安全」才如此「措置」的，當然我們對於這種「賢明」的措置是不反對的，但是對於這種「因噎廢食」的舉動却有點不議成，因爲那此無法宣洩的車輛除了擁到西藏路橋而外是無可走的。何況北浙江路又是輸汾北站乘客唯一孔道。</p>
<p>現在上海交通擁擠的情形常然不止北西藏路一處，以上不過是筆老親眼看到的事實而已。</p>
<p>現在筆者提出幾個問題來，希望交通當局自己檢討檢討。（一）裝貨之卡車准許通過之路綫是否需要視倉庫之位置及碼頭之交通情形而酌量更改。因爲有些路綫是禁止裝貨之卡車通過的，有些卡車欲達目的地時，勢必繞道他處。如此之繞道而行，足以增加別處車輛之擁塞。（二）對於浙江路橋的禁止人力車，三輸車，卡車之通過，其失當處作何補救。（三）車輛擁塞時而致交通之局部停頓之狀態時，其造成此種混亂情形之車輛，是否告受到應得之處分。</p>
<p>最後希望當局不要把上海的交通再恢復到從前那種混亂的樣子（北西藏路的情形已超過了從前），應該隨時隨地的檢討，並着實際的改善，萬萬不能「因噎廢食」！</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>粵省主席羅卓英</h3>
<p>— 接青</p>
<p>現任廣東省政府出席爲羅卓英將軍，字尤齊，廣東大埔人，今年五十三歲，羅氏雖爲粵篇，但在江浙兩省充任軍職時期較長，對嶺南反少淵源。</p>
<p>羅氐是保定軍官學校第八期砲兵科畢業生，與陳誠將軍同期同隊，且同一寢室，兩人志同道合，甚爲投契。離校以後，從民國十一年開始，羅氏一直協助陳氏負責軍務，深得倚重。民國十四年，陳氏出任首都警備司令時，雖氏會任駐守國府大門的警術隊長，遇有中央要員出入，照例要立正敬禮，當時的羅氏本人，恐怕也想不到有今日的地位吧。</p>
<p>抗戰期中，緬甸吃緊，羅氏籍陳將軍的推薦，出任緬甸遠征軍總司令，地位榮耀，爲各方所羨慕。</p>
<p>羅氏膚色微黑，稍近肥胖，身軀短小，體格强狀，爲人精細陰柔，善用兵，也有「常勝將軍」之號。羅氏出身否門第，戎馬倥偬中，不廢吟咏，時有佳作發表在于右老所編「樂府」詩刊。</p>
<p>羅氏主政廣東，依然不脫治軍的嚴峻方法，因此，有人以「低氣壓」來欲徵今日的粵省行政。</p>
<p>今年夏天，羅氏曾下令公務員在辦公時間內不准穿香港衫；最近在廣東全省行政會議，他更規定專員和縣長要衣劃一的制服，從這兩點上看，可以的略窺見他的作風了。</p>
<h3>偷小便製秘藥</h3>
<p>— 學甄</p>
<p>別幾天本刋的「小弟弟失踪」一文裏，提到了一種名呌「×石」（按即秋石）的國藥。我想起有個朋友的遠親是經營此種事業的，有一天我們也曾談到了這問題，承他告訴我許多甚爲可貴的材料。</p>
<p>據說「秋石」的確是一種良好的藥品；能治產後失調肺癆吐血等陰虧之症，假定常服，更有常駐靑春，延年益壽之功。而且到目前爲止，製造該項藥品的人才和地方都很少。</p>
<p>「秋石」的製造法是一個秘方，祗傅十不傳女，以免爲外人學去，聽說我朋友遠親那個地方，是國內寥寥的幾個製造處的最好一個。他們春夏秋三季完全不工作，直到冬令一屆才大忙特忙了起來，四處入方設法去一桶一桶的挑童便來。普通這種童便的來源總不外乎是距離較近的小學校，稍給學校的管事人等一些賄賂，就由你設法　聚而挑個不盡了。</p>
<p>等到製造　老闆（即知這製迭秘法的人）一看認爲已　得夠用，便在外人不能入的秘室中合起藥來，一面把道些弄來的童便傾在大鍋裘　樂架火燒上數日數夜燒乾了再加，直等規定日子來到，才滅火，而把已燒乾了剩餘在鍋裏的雪白渣滓剷出，恭敬小心的藏起來或發賣。製藥的步驟亦告全部成功。不過燒時臭聞十里，附近的居民都怨聲載道大罵道人家要絕子絕孫。所以燒的地方就大都揀在山林之中或僻野處，以免妨礙別人。</p>
<p>「秋石」顏色雪白，帶鹹味，晨起時冲開水當鹽湯喝是最滋補不過的東西，可是價錢貴得驚人，幾萬境錢祗能買一包，普通人是喫不起的。</p>
<p>最近本市小孩子時常發現失而復得的事情，推測其目的或在取其小便，也有極大可能。不過製造藥品所需的意便是絕對大量的，而像我所說那家「秋石」製造處，遠在嘉善過去的陶莊，假使弄不着童便竟至設法到上海來冒着類似犯法的險，而來覓取，那眞可說是不惜工本了！</p>
<p>不過關於一秋石」本身的效用，迷信多於事實。試想：那些小便或來自有病的孩童，製秋石者根本不知小便中是些什麼成分竟製起藥來，即使對某些病確有效力，但這在今日，總是不可思議的！</p>
<h3>嘉言</h3>
<p>— 贊英</p>
<p>沒有時間運動的人，一定有時間生病；沒有時間鬆懈一下神經的人，一定有時間失眠。</p>
<p>善於充實自己生命的人，也就是最懂得運動和時常鬆懈神經的人。</p>
<h3>週末茶話</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>一言以蔽之</p>
<p>申報這次主辦的十大新聞評選揭曉了，看過上海的十大新聞，我們實在感到很深的悵觸。除了第二及第七第八三項外，乎幾沒有一件不是關聯着目前動亂的經濟狀況；糧貸，金磚，攤販，姜公美，郁香濃，榮德生以至於上海小姐之所以釀成，一言以蔽之，都是漫無止境的高物價在那裏作集。記不淸是這當中的那一件「案」子了，曾有一個獲案的主犯供述：「與其坐以待斃，莫若挺而走險」。此時此地，這兩句話尤其可作爲上面這許許多多巨案的結論。歲暮天寒，各案雖都已近尾聲，而金價米價勢不會因年度更新而停跳。一年後的今日，如果再來評選一次，是否可以讓我們不再看到這些親者所痛的事件呢？</p>
<p>物極必反</p>
<p>報載阿培維爾大學畢業生杜伐爾，十八年前因厭棄近代生活，閉戶瑞居，在一塊小天地中虛度了十八載年華，從未出門一步。有人說這眞是原子時代的怪物，我則認爲大謬不然。蓋現在大學生太活潑了，幾十年來，從跳舞，戀愛「沙蟹」起，已進化到快要向南北極探險的程度。時代旣矯枉過正，當然就物極必反，因之杜伐爾不異現身說法，把自己先關起來，而且一關就是十八年，以示力挽社會頺風之決心。上海得風氣之先，失業的大學生有志修一修「民國史」之類的長篇巨著的，不妨做做「中國杜伐爾，」即使「髮鬚渝膝，遍身蛆蟲—仍然「並無神經病，聰明逾常人」，儘可放心；不過所成問題的是「報紙及食物」還須先行妥爲準備耳。</p>
<p>「神經衰弱」真諦</p>
<p>和朋友去聽京戲，正上演「捉放書」，舞台上的曹操已經拿一把寳劍從幕後殺到了幕外，遇見呂伯奢，又是一劍砍翻了；我這位朋友是業醫的，這時他忽然若有所感的說：「曹操一定是患有神經衰弱症的人。」但是我看着台上陳宮那副慌急，懊喪，而又充分現出善良的神色，倒覺得他的神經衰弱較之曹操還要嚴重得多。譬之現在，有人急公好義，借一筆款項給難渡年關的朋友，聲明不要「高利貸」，這當然是仁至義盡；但是後來這朋友竟携款遠颶，莫知所終，結果害得此公周轉不靈，自殺殉友，這和呂伯奢施恩遭戮又有什麼兩樣？但我們這時候萬不能像陳宮那樣「神經衰弱」起來，責之以世道人心，一定要冷眼旁觀；這位忘恩負義的朋友或有一日在逋逃的那筆款項上有了辦法，投機成功，儼然名流，你就可以斂容而進，丑表一番：「我固知公必有今日，那傢伙死得活該，適大！」社會名流多少都有點「神經衰弱」的，你應該　循這條以不變應萬變的原則。陳宮後來終於在白門樓被曹操殺掉，原因很簡單；他根本不懂這一套，「神經衰弱症」比一般人嚴重！</p>

<h3>First Reading of the Draft Constitution Completed; National Assembly Session Extended by Two More Days</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The twelfth plenary session of the National Assembly was held at 9:30 AM on the 20th, with 1,208 representatives in attendance. President Chiang and his wife were both present. The presidium was rotated to the second group, including Bai Chongxi, with Cheng Ji serving as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman announced that the agenda for the day was a report on the results of the comprehensive review committee's examination. Chen Cheng, convener of the comprehensive committee, then presented the report. Chen first reported on the scope of the group's review and the issues examined, then explained the review and amendment situation item by item (the full text is in the left corner, relevant content). At 10:50 AM, Chen delivered a lengthy report on countless items in one breath over the course of one hour and ten minutes. He paused to ask the chairman if he could take a break, but the chairman instructed him to continue. Exhausted, he sped through the remainder of the report, which was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. At that point, the chairman announced that there would be no discussion that day. Secretary-General Hong then reported that representatives could submit opinions on the comprehensive review results in accordance with Article 24 of the Assembly's rules of procedure. Subsequently, female representatives such as Huang Peilan vied to speak, questioning why the comprehensive committee had omitted the report on the number of female representatives selected for the Legislative Yuan. The Secretary-General repeatedly announced that there would be no discussion that day, and then immediately adjourned the meeting. This concluded the first reading phase of the constitution-making process.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The National Assembly Presidium held its 22nd meeting at 11:00 AM on the 20th, with over thirty attendees, including Bai Chongxi. It was resolved to extend the Assembly session by two more days, until the 24th. The thirteenth plenary session will be held at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM on the 21st, with Hu Shi serving as chairman in the morning and Zhu Jiahua in the afternoon. It is also reported that the presidium held two meetings the previous day and yesterday, during which they discussed for a long time and drafted five articles on the procedures for implementing constitutional governance, which will be submitted to the Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The inaugural meeting of the First National Assembly Female Representatives Association was held at the Lizi Society this afternoon. The directors elected on the spot were Luo Heng, Qian Jianqiu, Bao Deming, Pi Yishu, Shen Huiyun, Zhou Shuyun, Zhang Mojun, Huang Peilan, Qian Yonghe, Lü Xiaodao, and Wang Liwen. The alternate directors were Zhang Bangzhen, Kuai Xia, Chen Yiyun, Wang Xiaoying, and Luo Jingxuan. The supervisors were Lü Yunzhang, Luo Jingxuan, Cui Zhenhua, Cui Shuyan, and Wu Yifang. The alternate supervisors were Ji Qingyi, Hu Lan, and Wang Xiaohua. All unanimously elected Madame Chiang as the chairperson and discussed fully supporting the National Assembly's quota for women, which should account for 20%.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Huang Boying, a National Assembly representative directly selected by the National Government, was unable to attend the Assembly due to circumstances. His name has been removed from the register, and Chen Gun will fill the vacancy by order.</p>
<h3>Provisional Meeting of the Comprehensive Review Committee; Final Review of Several Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The Comprehensive Review Committee for the Draft Constitution held a provisional meeting at 9:45 PM on the 20th to conduct a final review of several unresolved issues. Eighty-three people attended, including Lin Bin and Shi Shangkuan. Chairman Chen Cheng first reported on the issue of the capital city. As discussions among various parties are still underway, it will be reserved for final review.</p>
<p>Next, the committee discussed several unresolved issues. More than forty people, including Chen Cheng, proposed changing the word "all" in the second and third paragraphs of Article 58 to "attending," which was passed without objection. Next, the committee discussed the quota for women in elections, resolving that "various elections should stipulate a quota for women, and the specific measures shall be determined by law." The original wording passed by the First Review Committee, "at least accounting for 20%," was deleted.</p>
<p>Next, the committee discussed the quota for National Assembly representatives from inland areas with special customs, resolving that "various elections should stipulate a quota for National Assembly representatives from inland areas with special customs, and the election measures shall be determined by law." Regarding the issue of the Tibetan local autonomy system, the original provision stated that "the Constitution should guarantee it." Several representatives believed that the phrase "the Constitution should guarantee it" was inappropriate and unanimously agreed to delete "the Constitution," changing it to "The Tibetan local autonomy system should be guaranteed." Finally, the committee discussed adding clauses on recall, initiative, and referendum to the Constitution. This proposal had already been passed in principle and submitted to the editing group for textual amendments. Ruan Yisheng and others believed that the Chinese people had no experience with recall, etc., and if the Constitution only made provisions for the three types of civil rights for the president, it would inevitably cause problems in the future and increase the difficulty for future National Assemblies. It would be better to have these provisions determined by law. Jiang Yiping also believed that recall could be stipulated in the Constitution, but it seemed more appropriate to stipulate initiative and referendum by law. Ren Zhuoxuan held a different view, believing that the National Assembly did not have enough experience with elections, let alone recall, and this should not be a reason for not including recall, etc., in the Constitution. He believed that the Constitution should have some provisions in principle regarding the three types of civil rights mentioned above. Lin Bin also argued that it would be best to have provisions in principle to serve as the basis for future legislation. Other representatives also raised several amendment suggestions regarding the wording. Chen Cheng also believed that regarding recall, Article 132 of the Draft Constitution already stipulated that "those elected may be recalled by the original electoral district in accordance with the law," so there was no need to make further provisions. It was appropriate to leave the implementation of initiative and referendum to separate legislation. The representatives generally agreed and resolved that the five articles added by the First Review Committee regarding recall were already provided for in the original draft and would not be stipulated again. The exercise of the rights of initiative and referendum would be determined by law.</p>
<p>After the discussion was completed, Kong Geng and thirty other people made a temporary motion, hoping that there could be provisions regarding the transitional clauses for constitutional governance. Kong explained briefly that the main tasks of this National Assembly were twofold: to draft the Constitution and to determine the date of its implementation. The work of drafting the Constitution was already 80-90% complete, but it would be impossible to immediately implement the Constitution after its completion. However, constitutional governance "must be implemented to some extent." Before the president is elected, how the Constitution will be promulgated is a matter of great importance to the country, the nation, and the people's safety. He hoped that the "Law on the Implementation Procedures of the Constitution" could be attached to the Constitution, otherwise it would become baseless and lead to non-compliance with the law. He also declared that this matter was the responsibility of the representatives and had nothing to do with parties or stubbornness. Finally, it was unanimously resolved to submit this temporary motion to the presidium. At this point, a representative suddenly requested a discussion on the issue of the capital city. The attendees generally believed that this matter still needed to be studied and would not be discussed today. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Conclusion of the Comprehensive Review Committee (Continued)</h3>
<p>(3) The issue of adding clauses on the local autonomy system of Tibet: The medical report changed the clauses drafted by the Eighth Review Committee to the following: 1. The local autonomy system of the Mongolian leagues and banners shall be determined by law. 2. The local autonomy system of Tibet shall be determined by law. Because Tibetan representatives raised opinions, believing that Tibet and Mongolia were different, this letter was read aloud at the same time. Jiang Yiping said that this provision was the result of the hard work of the review committee, and if it was not added, Tibet would be treated the same as a province. Adding this article would provide some protection for the current system of Tibet. Tibetan representative Yexi Daje said, "Do not add it." Luo Jialun once said: Tibet is a part of the Republic of China. We welcome Tibet's inclusion. This shows that it is not divided, but unified. The chairman declared that Bai Chongxi, the convener of the Eighth Group, would report. Bai explained that at the time of adding Article "121", it was made clear that Tibet would still retain its current political system and would never be changed. However, the Tibetan representatives said that they came here to participate in the conference and were not ordered to discuss this matter. However, I told them that the constitution already stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal, and Tibet is one of the five major ethnic groups. The Tibetan government is also a local government, belonging to the local system. Therefore, it was classified into the local system group during the review. They asked whether Tibet should be included in the local system. I said that Tibet is a part of the Republic of China, which is recognized by the world. They did not want to include the word "Tibet" in the constitution. I said that it must be there. If there is none, Tibet will not be able to enjoy any national benefits. The situation in Tibet is special, and it has been like this since the history of the Republic of China. We should preserve its special system. Yexi Daje reiterated: We do not want to add such clauses, because we are here to participate in the conference to deepen feelings and promote intimacy with each other. If such a provision is made, it will definitely affect the feelings of both parties. Later, Jiang Yiping expressed that he could authorize the editing group to consult with the Tibetan representatives and then discuss it again. Soon after, Zhuan Qinian, Liu Zongping and others spoke, all expressing their willingness to add this article, but the wording could be modified appropriately. After discussion, the entire session declared that the former of the two added articles was passed without objection. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Stabilization of the International Monetary System: International Monetary Fund Announces Commencement on March 2nd of Next Year; Exchange Rates of Various Countries Do Not Correspond to Actual Currency Values</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 19th] The International Monetary Fund, established for a year, announced today that it will commence its currency stabilization work on March 2nd of next year. This is largely based on the current exchange rates of various countries. Among the 39 member states, the Fund has already stipulated legal parities for 30, based on existing regulations, but declared that it does not guarantee their value. The currency values of China, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies were postponed due to requests from China, France, and the Netherlands. Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Greece, Poland, and Yugoslavia also postponed the stipulation of their currency values at their own requests. The Fund acknowledged that the accepted exchange rates do not correspond to their actual currency values, but abandoning this would increase the risk of inflation for many countries. The Fund's Managing Director, Mr. Gutt, told reporters today that the Fund does not adopt a pegged exchange rate system, and each member state should maintain its own currency value. The Fund is aware that black markets exist in all countries, where the local currency value is below the legal exchange rate accepted by the Fund, but it does not take this into account. The Fund stipulates the legal parity of each country's currency and sets the deadline for commencing currency stabilization work as March 1st of next year. Member states must pay their respective shares of the total fund of $7.5 billion before this deadline. The United States contributes the most, reaching $2.75 billion. Once the full amount is collected, member states needing foreign currency for international trade and other transactions can apply to the Fund for short-term loans.</p>

Furthermore, the Vietnamese Minister of Defense recently sent a letter to General Morlière, the French commissioner in Tokyo and Northern Annam, protesting the French army's attack on Vietnamese troops stationed at the border between Vietnam and China. A spokesperson for the French High Commissioner's office in Vietnam commented that the French army did not attack the Vietnamese army, but only retaliated when attacked by the Vietnamese.</p>

<h3>Zhang Hanying Talks About Returning from Inspection: The Yellow River is Extremely Rich in Treasures; Flood Control is Not Without a Solution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 20th] The Water Conservancy Commission organized a Yellow River Exploration and Research Group this summer, and appointed Mr. Zhang Hanying, a member of the Commission, as the leader, and Liu Derun, Lei Hongji, Li Fudu, Zhou Li, Zhang Erjun, Tan Baotai and others as members. They set out from Nanjing in July of this year and conducted an on-the-spot survey along the river for four months. They have now returned to Nanjing. A reporter visited Zhang Hanying, who told them the following:</p>
<p>(1) Itinerary: After leaving Nanjing, the group went upstream along the river at the junction of Henan and Shanxi, and then followed the junction of Shanxi and Shaanxi to Hukou, and then up to Guide in Qinghai to study the upper reaches. Then, from Lanzhou, they followed the river to Ningxia, bypassed the Hetao in the north, and went east to Baotou to reach Guihua. The only section that could not be reached above the middle reaches was the section from Tuoketuo to Hukou.</p>
<p>(2) Research Objectives: One is to reduce the flood disasters in the lower reaches, and the other is to investigate whether there are any resources in the Yellow River that can be developed. Flood control requires equal emphasis on the upper and lower reaches. In the upper reaches, it is necessary to control floods and reduce sediment to prevent dangerous floods and excessive silting in the lower reaches. In the lower reaches, it is necessary to repair dikes and adjust river channels to keep the water flow in line. Unfortunately, the lower reaches could not be inspected because the old channel has not been restored.</p>
<p>(3) Building Reservoirs in the Middle Reaches: Only in terms of the upper and middle reaches, to control floods, reservoirs can be built in the Sanmenxia of Shan County and the Balihutong of Xin'an County. Building a dam in Xin'an can control the flow in the lower reaches to below 10,000 cubic meters per second. Based on this flow, adjusting the river channel in the lower reaches will definitely prevent floods from leaving the channel, and it can generate 1.2 million horsepower of electricity. However, the problem of reservoir siltation is very important. To seek relief, other projects must be implemented to reduce the downward flow of floods, such as bank protection, gully prevention, and land use. The construction of other Yongku projects can also reduce the severity of siltation in this reservoir. For example, building another reservoir in Shimen upstream of Longmen at the junction of Shanxi and Shaanxi not only has great economic value, but also helps the Balihutong to store water and prevent sand. The success of the Shimen Yongku not only controls a part of the flood and stores a part of the sediment, but also generates 800,000 horsepower of electricity, irrigates the Weibei Plateau and the lower reaches of the Fenhe River, and solves a part of the transportation problem. The purpose of the Balihutong Reservoir is to control floods, while the Shimen Reservoir is for multi-objective development and is very economically valuable. Cheap water and electricity are the source of industrial development. In the early days, the industrial reason was not yet developed, or the bitter origin could not be exhausted, but it could be used to raise river water to supply the fields on the highlands. This is what the local area urgently needs at present. The largest wealth in North China is land, and the reason why land production is not abundant is due to insufficient rainfall. Therefore, the electricity generated by the river water is used to raise the river water to irrigate the fields, which serves both purposes, and there is no worry that electricity will not be sold.</p>
<p>(4) Irrigation of the Sui-Ning Plain: The Ningxia-Suiyuan Plain is an excellent place to use the Yellow River to irrigate fields. Although it is currently in a rudimentary state, it has not been fully utilized. Ningxia and Suiyuan are located in the frontier, and the plains along the river are the granary of the border area, which is of great importance to national defense. The Anti-Japanese War has provided an example of this. Of the 10 million mu of land that can be irrigated in the Houtao, only one-eleventh of it is currently irrigated. The plains of Baotou and Guihua have not been calculated. The current irrigated area in Ningxia is about 3 million mu, which can be doubled after improvement. Outside the Ning-Sui Plain are the Helan Mountains, the Lang Mountains, and the Ula Mountains, which are also natural defense lines. Being there, one feels even more the need to improve Ning-Sui water conservancy in advance. In addition, when we traveled by sheepskin raft through the Yellow River gorges between Gansu and Ningxia, we felt that there were many places that could be utilized. If a dam is built in the Black Mountain Gorge to raise the water level, the sandy wasteland north of Tongxin City can be irrigated and cultivated. There are many other places that can be utilized.</p>
<p>(5) Gains and Losses of the Japanese Yellow River Management Plan: The purpose of the Japanese Yellow River management was to develop the electricity of the Fei River, without coordinating with other industries, which is not what our country needs. Therefore, its plan needs further study.</p>
<p>Zhang finally said that this inspection was limited by time. Not only did he not go to the lower reaches, but he also did not go to the major tributaries, which he deeply regretted. Because to manage the Yellow River, the upper, middle and lower reaches must be combined, and the main and branch must be planned together. However, based on the inspections so far, it is known that it is not impossible to prevent and control the Yellow River floods, and there are many treasures that can be used to develop the economic undertakings of the nine provinces.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Social Affairs Allocates One Million to Reward Workers of Zhongxing Coal Mine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 20th] Before the Communist army withdrew from Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mine on October 8, they destroyed two generators.

The Ministry of Social Affairs has awarded a bonus of one million yuan to reward them.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Beginning of International Currency Control</h3>
<p>The International Monetary Fund announced yesterday the legal exchange rates of its member countries, scheduled to take effect on March 1st of next year. However, eight countries, including ours, did not participate and requested a postponement. This is a significant international event in recent times. Its importance lies not in the setting of exchange rate standards, but in the fact that member countries of the International Monetary Fund feel that there should be further international cooperation and control over their respective currencies. A country's control over its own currency is originally within its sovereignty, and it should have the freedom to handle it without international control. Therefore, regarding the regulation of its own currency exchange rate, that is, the increase or decrease in the external value of its currency, each country originally had full authority. However, the increase or decrease in the external value of a country's currency not only affects the economic prosperity of that country itself, but also often involves international interests. Therefore, in the past, in order to determine currency exchange rate standards, there were agreements between countries regarding currency exchange rates; such as during the Great Depression of 1929, there were agreements between Britain and the United States regarding currency exchange rates. At the same time, in order to stabilize our country's silver-based monetary system, there was also the Silver Agreement to stabilize the price of silver and maintain our country's monetary system.</p>
<p>The announcement of legal exchange rates by the member countries of the International Monetary Fund this time indicates a fact: that countries have accepted the principle of international control over the regulation of currency exchange rates. In other words, a country has transferred part of its sovereignty to an international organization in its control over its currency. This is the reason why the announcement of legal exchange rates by the member countries of the International Monetary Fund this time is a significant international event in recent times. As stated in the communiqué issued by the fund: "The main significance of this measure lies not in the announced exchange rates, but in the fact that the participating countries have established a system under which they pledge to cooperate in maintaining exchange rate stability, and will not change the exchange rates of their respective currencies except in accordance with the terms stipulated in the Fund Agreement, in order to cooperate in achieving the purposes of the Fund." What deserves our attention is "except in accordance with the terms stipulated in the Fund Agreement, the legal exchange rates of the respective currencies will not be changed." From this, it can be seen that the increase or decrease in the external value of a country's currency cannot be handled arbitrarily by a country, but must be done with international cooperation.</p>
<p>This is a good phenomenon of closer international cooperation. The currency chaos that occurred in Europe after the First World War is still fresh in our memory. In order to prevent the recurrence of this situation, the establishment of the International Monetary Fund is aimed at stabilizing the finances of various countries after the war. A country's financial instability not only causes suffering to itself, but also affects international affairs. The regulation of the legal exchange rates of various currencies this time, even if there are some discrepancies with the actual situation, is acceptable as long as the countries concerned are willing to accept it. Moreover, the regulation of legal exchange rates does not mean that the legal exchange rates will never change. On the contrary, an important responsibility of the International Monetary Fund is to review at any time whether it is necessary to change the previously set legal exchange rates. Therefore, the announcement of legal exchange rates by the member countries of the International Monetary Fund this time is only the initial step in the international control of currencies. The previously set legal exchange rates can be changed by the Fund if necessary in the future; the Fund can also use its funds to maintain the monetary systems of member countries. This is truly a good manifestation of the spirit of "one world."</p>
<p>What we regret is that such an important international initiative, without the participation of the Soviet Union, inevitably leaves some regrets in "one world." The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and its economic system is different from other countries; but what we do not understand is why there cannot be international monetary control cooperation in different economic systems. We believe that this shortcoming is definitely not a sign of the so-called "two worlds"; in the international control of currencies, just as in the international control of armaments, we also need the cooperation of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>As for the postponement of the announcement of our country's legal currency exchange rate, it was originally inevitable due to the current objective facts. However, the postponement is only a matter of time, and the problem itself does not disappear due to the delay in time. According to the published legal exchange rates of various countries, most of them are based on the existing exchange rates, such as the conversion of 119.201 francs to one US dollar, which seems to be based on the existing official exchange rate. There are many problems surrounding our country's legal exchange rate. Since the International Monetary Fund can review the timing and change the legal exchange rate at any time, it seems that we do not necessarily need to overemphasize the announcement of the initial legal exchange rate. In that case, the financial authorities must have plans; in terms of the current situation, the request for our country to postpone the announcement of the legal exchange rate at this time seems to be a timely measure and should be commended.</p>

<h3>Commercial Vessels Successfully Sail Directly to Jingu After Passing Through Tanggu New Port Ship Lock, Opening a New Chapter in the History of Northern Shipping Lines</h3>
<p>[News from Tianjin] In the past, northern shipping line vessels sailing to Tianjin from various ports, with a load capacity of 3,000 tons or more, were unable to enter the Haihe River due to the Lanmensha sandbar in front of Dagu Port. They had to anchor outside the Lanmensha and use barges to transport passengers and cargo to Tanggu or Tianjin, requiring a four- or five-day stop outside the port, resulting in significant delays and losses. Since the completion and successful trial voyage of the Tanggu New Port gate on the 15th of this month, the Xinhai Shanghai, a vessel of the Tongyun Company with a draft of 15 feet and 4 inches, arrived outside Ben Gukou on the 16th. Because the water depth of the Lanmensha sandbar was only 12 feet, it could not enter the port. On the 17th at 9:00 a.m., it sailed into Tanggu New Port, passed through the gate (which took only 21 minutes), and entered the Haihe River, mooring at the old Tanggu pier, unloading part of the cargo, and then continuing to Tianjin. Also, on the morning of the 19th, the Jingxing, a vessel of 3,500 tons, and the Zhongfu, a vessel of 1,200 tons, also passed smoothly through the Tanggu New Port ship lock. In the future, vessels of more than 3,000 tons going to Jin Gu from places such as Shanghai will not be obstructed by the Lanmensha sandbar outside Dagu Port and can enter Jin Gu, which is good news for northern shipping lines.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The United Nations Security Council today unanimously approved a US proposal to send a committee to the Balkans to investigate disputes in the border areas of Greece and its neighboring countries. After lengthy and complex debate, it was decided to limit the scope of the investigation to northern Greece and other locations in Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia that the delegation deems should be included. Egypt and the United Kingdom abstained from voting, and the other nine countries voted in favor. However, because the discussion only involved procedural issues, the United Kingdom's veto power was not exercised. The passage of the resolution was due to mutual concessions from both sides of the dispute. Soviet representative Gromyko no longer insisted that the scope of the investigation include the domestic situation in Greece, and US representative Johnson also accepted Pieranti's proposal to expand the scope of the investigation, not limited to the border area. It was decided by a vote of eight to two that the investigation team would be composed of one representative from each of the eleven countries on the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 19th] The Security Council today approved the establishment of an investigation team to go to the northern border of Greece to investigate disputes.

In addition, the Security Council has notified Secretary-General Lie to transmit this resolution to the countries concerned to facilitate the work. Each member of the team can choose their own assistant, and the Secretary-General has been asked to provide technical personnel.</p>

<h3>US Expands Bipartisan Cooperation; Currently Unlikely to Happen; Foreign Policy is the Responsibility of the President</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 19th] The Republican Party's request to President Truman to expand bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy regarding China, Argentina, and Palestine has been met with a cold response from the White House. Republican Senator Vandenberg, who is about to become the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the new Congress, made this request at a press conference here last Monday. He pointed out that past bipartisan cooperation was limited to organizing the United Nations and convening the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers to draft the European peace treaty. When a reporter raised this question at the White House yesterday, Mr. Truman replied: "American foreign policy is of course the responsibility of the President, and when it relates to the powers of the Senate, it will be discussed with the Senate."

<h3>The Most Lively Christmas in History in the United States</h3>
<p>...In the past, Santa Claus used</p>
<p>cars to deliver gifts, but this year, he uses</p>
<p>airplanes and parachutes to deliver gifts, so that</p>
<p>in this way, the gifts really come like myths</p>
<p>said to be from heaven...</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 19th] Christmas celebrations in the United States will be ready this week. The commercial districts of various cities and towns are particularly crowded, and the sound of the Salvation Army's bells is scattered in every corner of the downtown area, collecting donations for the unfortunate. Department stores are crowded with people buying Christmas gifts, and people want to win the joy and surprise of their parents or children.</p>
<p>This Christmas is the most lively in the history of the United States. The merchant's trade volume in Christmas 1939 was US$4.5 billion, in 1945 it was US$8.5 billion, and this year it is expected to be US$10.5 billion.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Commerce, because there are too many shipments, there is no phenomenon of rushing to buy, but this year's Christmas is still the most lively. Although there have been many labor strikes recently, the production of consumer goods in 1946 has reached the highest figure. Companies give bonuses to employees, and they use them to buy Christmas gifts. As a result, tens of millions of yuan fell into the pockets of working people before Christmas. To give a few examples, Craven's Becan Electric Company issued a total of 1.5 million yuan in bonuses. Because various advertisements are very moving, Christmas shopping activities have already begun in mid-November.</p>
<p>In the past, Santa Claus used cars to deliver gifts, but this year, he has come up with a whimsical idea. The advertisements all depict the old man using airplanes and parachutes to distribute gifts. In this way, children are more convinced that Santa Claus can travel around the world on the same day and bring gifts to children.</p>
<p>Churches and radio broadcasting departments are broadcasting carols. Children, as usual, visit those who are sick and old in various families to give them comfort.</p>
<p>This year's Christmas Eve has been further promoted due to the successful conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly, as US representative Austin said, "The achievements of this time have foreshadowed that we can achieve security without war. With the effective promotion of the United Nations, peace will last forever."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Conscription is About to Begin; 40,000 Eligible Young Men; Organized into a 10,000-Man Strong Army; Training Focuses on Specialized Mechanization; Government Employees Must be Conscripted</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to Lieutenant General Fu Zhengzheng, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District: According to central government regulations, this city is a conscription demonstration area, and the scale is larger than that of other provinces and cities. The so-called conscription is military service, which is the duty of every citizen, and the purpose is to train the people's physique and strengthen national defense. It is not the so-called "manpower requisition". Citizens of this city should work with peace of mind and not easily believe rumors. After conscription begins in this city, anyone who extorts, swindles, or evades military service will be severely punished.</p>
<p>The population of the Shanghai Garrison District is the largest of all districts in the country, totaling more than 8.8 million, and the jurisdiction covers 13 counties and cities. One is the Shanghai Group District, and the commander of the group district is Li Xiankai. The second is the Wuxian Group District, including Wuxian, Changshu, and Wujiang, and the person in charge is Commander Du Xu. The third is the Songjiang Group District, including Songjiang, Chuansha, Nanhui, and Jinshan, and the commander of the group district is Lu Yide. The Wuxian and Songjiang Group Districts have been established one after another and have begun conscripting soldiers. The Shanghai Group District is now in operation, but the address problem has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>It is learned that about 1% of the residents of this city are eligible for conscription, that is, 40,000 people. After excluding those who are physically weak, deferred, or exempted, a lottery will be drawn from them, and the planned establishment is about 10,000 people. The Shanghai Group District has a higher level, and after enlistment, the training focuses on special forces, special industry soldiers, and fortress soldiers, all of which are mechanized weapons training. The service period is two years for ordinary soldiers and three years for special forces. After the expiration of the term, they will be discharged. Then, the second batch of training will be selected, and they can be called up for enlistment in the event of war.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Fu went to Beijing on official business today, and plans to go to Chongqing around the 20th to end the original officer corps affairs, and return to Shanghai around the end of the year. During his absence from Shanghai, Deputy Commander Li Muliang is responsible.</p>

After investigation, the Postal Savings Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks have the same nature as banks. The active and age-eligible men among their employees, except those who have graduated from high school or above and obtained a military training certificate, are regarded as reserve cadres and will no longer be conscripted.

<h3>Australian Commercial Counsellor Hosts Press Conference to Inspect and Develop Trade in China</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Australian Commercial Counsellor Wooden came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and held a cocktail party yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. to entertain the press in this city. Mr. Wu stated that the purpose of this trip to China is to inspect the industrial and commercial situation in China as a basis for future trade development between the two countries. At present, the volume of trade between China and Australia is very small, because the output of various industrial and commercial products in Australia has recently been reduced due to the influence of labor, and due to war damage and inconvenient transportation in China, foreign trade has not yet entered the right track. It is hoped that there will be more development in the future.</p>
<p>When reporters asked for his opinion on the exchange rate between China and Australia, he said that the exchange rate between Chinese legal currency and Australian gold pounds is calculated based on US dollars, with four US dollars equal to one Australian pound, but in fact it should be a ratio of six to one.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu has been away from China for six years. From 1938 to 1941, he served as the vice president of the Australian Trade Commission, and then went to India and Singapore. He was captured by the Japanese during the war, and only regained his freedom after victory.</p>
<h3>Ohardt Case: The Only Female Defendant, Mrs. Mueller, is on Trial</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mrs. Mueller, the only female defendant in the Ohardt Bureau case, was on trial in the US military court yesterday morning. She testified that a few days after the German surrender, Volkler, the head of the Peiping branch of the Ohardt Bureau, told her that the Japanese side needed them to work. Because she was afraid that if she refused, she would be detained by the Japanese side, and because of economic difficulties, she served the Japanese side under Volkler's instructions.

<h3>Immediately After Leaving Prison, Shen Fuchen Counter-Accuses: Ding Guitang is Accused of Collaborating with the Enemy; How is the Truth Being Investigated</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Ding Guitang, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs and Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, was recently accused by Shen Fuchen, a former customs guard, of collaborating with the enemy, committing malfeasance for personal gain, oppressing the innocent, and harboring personnel, and reported to the relevant authorities. All of Ding's illegal acts from 1936 to 1946 were listed, and the case is currently under investigation by the agency that accepted the report.</p>
<p>Ding Guitang issued a statement on the case yesterday, saying: "After the victory, I was ordered to take over the customs, and everything was handled in accordance with the government's orders. Later, Commissioner Li Du, by the order of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, established the 'Examination Committee for Customs Officers in Occupied Areas', which was responsible for examining whether customs officials in occupied areas had any suspicion of collaborating with the enemy, etc., and the Customs Administration appointed many people as members of the Examination Committee. Shen Fuchen has been working in the customs for ten years. The committee found that he had reported the names of senior officials in the occupied areas in the rear to the Japanese customs authorities, so it was decided that Shen was suspected of collaborating with the enemy. The matter was submitted to the Chongqing Customs for approval by the Customs Administration, and Shen Fuchen should be dismissed and sent to the court for investigation. At that time, I was serving as the Commissioner of Customs, so I followed the telegram order and sent Shen to the court for investigation. In fact, this was not my idea." He then made a statement on the various accusations: "I have been serving in the customs for nearly 30 years and have always abided by the law. Sometimes, I have offended people because I was ordered to recruit and execute personnel. If I am indeed guilty of all the charges, I will be punished by law.

<p>It is reported that Shen Fuchen was accused of being a traitor after the victory. After three months of investigation by the court, it was finally determined that there was insufficient evidence to release him.</p>
<h3>Ordered to Thoroughly Investigate the Armory Explosion Case; Vice Minister Qin Arrives in Shanghai for On-Site Inspection; The Trial May Be Completed and Returned to Beijing Within a Week; Director Yang Reports on the Process and Believes There is No Conspiracy</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Qin Dechun, Vice Minister of National Defense, was ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the explosion case at the armory of the First Supply District of the Jiangwan Logistics Command and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Yang Jizeng, Director of the Ordnance Administration, Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply District, and Mao Chenghua, Director of the Ordnance Department, all went to welcome him. After Vice Minister Qin got off the car, he was accompanied by Commander Fu to the reception center of the supply district for rest, and met with reporters from various newspapers and made a statement saying: "The government attaches great importance to the explosion case at the Jiangwan armory. As it is located in Shanghai, which is of international concern, it is a very unfortunate event. As for how to handle this case, it can only be decided after meeting with Director Yang, Commander Fu, and others. I have received the reports from Commissioner Lei Shaojie and Deputy Director Ling Chengxu in Beijing, but because they are both preliminary investigations, they can only be used as a reference during the preliminary hearing and must be discussed with all parties. Only after on-site investigation can the truth be clarified." Qin continued to say that he planned to spend a week in Shanghai to complete the trial of the case and then return to Beijing to report.</p>
<p>Qin immediately exchanged views with Director Yang. Yang told him about the investigation process and stated his feelings, saying: "The cause of the explosion, based on reports from all parties and the results of on-site investigation, should not involve any conspiracy. Because the destroyed truck at the explosion point was heavily damaged on the side facing the armory, while the outside part was not damaged at all. The bodies of the soldiers killed in the explosion were lying on their backs, and the soldiers who were injured and escaped were all injured in the back. This proves that the explosion started from the inside of the armory and the bombs exploded from the inside out. Moreover, five trucks of hand grenades were transported by the Zhejiang Supply Bureau that day. Three trucks were delivered in the morning, and most of the wooden boxes containing them were damaged. The wooden boxes of the two trucks delivered in the afternoon were intact. Therefore, the cause of the explosion may have been that the grenades exploded when they fell to the ground due to the damage of the wooden boxes during the sorting. Based on his past experience, the primer may be shaken when the hand grenade lands, which may cause an explosion. The only regret is the escape of Wang Renshan, the director of the branch warehouse, and Wu Rubiao and Chen Hanwen, the warehouse managers. If they only escaped out of fear of guilt, it would only make the investigation of this case more difficult."</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Bombed Site; Inquiring with Director Fu</h3>
<p>At 3:00 p.m., Vice Minister Qin, accompanied by Director Yang, Commander Fu, Director Mao, Military Judge Bao, and others, drove to the scene of the accident in Jiangwan for on-site inspection. They patrolled the bombed site for a week, starting from the easternmost explosion point. At that time, armory director Fu Jimin was still supervising the warehouse soldiers to clean up the remains. Shrapnel was still visible everywhere inside and outside the warehouse, and the wreckage of the destroyed trucks was still in place. Unexploded shells and grenades were collected and placed separately. Vice Minister Qin briefly questioned Director Fu on the ruins of the starting point of the explosion. According to Fu, on the day of the accident, he was in the dormitory about 500 meters away from the warehouse when he suddenly heard the sound of hand grenades exploding. Knowing that something was wrong, he rushed down from the building and went to the vicinity of the warehouse, where he saw shrapnel flying and smoke billowing, and the explosion became louder and louder and out of control. As for Wang Renshan, the director of the branch warehouse who was on the run, he usually lived a very hard life and often wore a pair of torn cloth shoes on his feet. His family did come to Shanghai the day before the explosion. On the morning of the accident, Wang took his wife out, and in the afternoon after the accident, his wife was still seen in the cloth area at 6:00 p.m. It is said that Wang already knew about the warehouse accident and told his wife that he would go to rescue it, but he has been missing ever since. As for the warehouse managers Wu Rubiao and Chen Hanwen, they were still on the scene when the accident occurred, and then they fled, probably out of fear of responsibility. Only the warehouse director's tone was firm when he stated his case, but he was haggard and had a dark complexion, which showed his worries and hard work in the past few weeks. Vice Minister Qin immediately comforted him and instructed him to make up for the loss, serve with peace of mind, and be extra careful to make up for his mistakes.</p>

<h3>School Sanitation Equipment Expected to Improve Next Year; Fee Standards Already Decided</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The city's Health Education Committee, recognizing the importance of school sanitation, has actively implemented a plan after careful calculation. However, as the cost of carrying out this work is quite large, and it is impossible to rely entirely on the city treasury for funding, it has decided to request the Education Bureau to issue an order to all schools to collect student health fees starting from the next semester. The collection methods are as follows: (1) The amount to be collected will remain the same as the resolution of the Health Education Committee. Municipal elementary schools will temporarily collect $2,000 per student per semester, municipal middle schools will temporarily collect $3,000, and private schools may increase the collection standard by 50% compared to municipal schools. Tuition-free students are exempt from collection. Vocational schools will charge fees according to the middle school standard, and collection will begin in the spring of the 36th year [1947]. (2) The Education Bureau will order all schools to collect and remit the fees together when collecting tuition fees. (3) The funds will be used exclusively for improving the environmental sanitation of each school and purchasing sanitation equipment, and should be stored in a special account, available for use at any time, and must not be used for other purposes. Private schools may use the fees to pay the salaries of medical personnel.</p>
<h3>Cai Pei Sentenced to Death, Commuted on Appeal; Full Text of Supreme Court Judgment</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Cai Pei, the traitor previously sentenced to death by the High Court, whose alias is Zi Ping, from Wuxi, is 62 years old. Before the war, he served as Director of the Counselor's Department of the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he participated in the puppet organization and successively served as the puppet Mayor of Nanjing, Ambassador to Japan, Chairman of the Food Commission, and member of the National Government. He was sentenced to death by the High Court on July 18 of this year. The defendant Cai Pei and his defense lawyer Zhang Shizhao also appealed. Now, the Supreme Court has reviewed the case and changed the sentence to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The full text of the Supreme Court judgment is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Verdict: The original judgment is revoked. Cai Pei conspired with the enemy country and plotted to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights. His property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Reasoning: The original judgment in this case found that the defendant, the petitioner Cai Pei (hereinafter referred to as the defendant), formerly served as Director of the Counselor's Department of the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Administrative Inspector of Jiangsu Province, and Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the National Government moved westward. He went to various provinces but lingered in Shanghai with the intention of waiting and seeing how things would turn out after the war suffered a slight setback. When Wang Jingwei established the puppet government in Nanjing, the defendant colluded with Zhou Fo Hai and Mei Si Ping and served as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the puppet government in April of the 29th year of the Republic [1940]. In June of the same year, he was transferred to the post of Mayor of the puppet Nanjing, handling puppet municipal administration and recruiting refugees in order to implement the puppet government's so-called reconstruction plan. He gave speeches to students undergoing training in the capital, vehemently opposing resistance against Japan. He also gave a speech entitled "Reflections on the Anniversary of the Return of the Puppet National Government to the Capital" at the celebration of the anniversary of the puppet government's return to the capital. In the speech, he wantonly vilified our government. He also went to Japan to participate in the celebration of the 2,600th anniversary of the enemy country. In January of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was reassigned as Chairman of the Food Management Committee of the puppet government, drafting food plans. In March of the same year, he served as an Accounting Committee member of the puppet Executive Yuan. In December, he was reassigned as a political advisor to the puppet National Government. In April of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he was specially appointed as the puppet Ambassador to Japan. He gave a speech in Beiping, expressing his determination to strengthen "Sino-Japanese friendship." In May, he arrived in Japan to meet with the enemy emperor and visited enemy cabinet ministers Konoe, Koiso, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, and enemy generals Abe, Matsui, and Doihara, discussing the enemy-puppet cooperation and overall peace issues. He also visited the ambassadors to Japan from the Axis powers of Germany and Italy to establish contacts. In November of the same year, the enemy and puppets signed the Alliance Treaty and issued a statement showing their determination to live and die together with the enemy. In January of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he represented Chen Gongbo in presenting 800,000 catties of sugar to the citizens of the enemy capital to show goodwill. In May of the same year, he resigned. The enemy emperor awarded him the First Class Order of the Rising Sun. After returning to China, he served as a member of the puppet National Government until the enemy surrendered and he was dismissed. The evidence for these facts is his own confession, his confession to the Military Intelligence Bureau, and the files of the puppet organization's Xinwen Bao, Xin Zhongguo Bao, Shen Bao, as well as the records of the puppet Foreign Ministry's participation in the Japanese celebration and the work reports of the puppet Embassy in Japan. It is explained that his defense that he took puppet posts due to coercion is merely an empty claim. His statement that his remarks were not his true intention is also clearly a fabrication. His claim of protecting the mausoleum is his responsibility as the puppet mayor. The provision of information was never implemented and is therefore invalid. His rescue of underground workers was merely an occasional response to the requests of friends, driven by emotional impulses. Other acts of disaster relief and assistance to the sick, even if they did occur, were nothing more than implementing the policies of the cunning enemy to win over our people, and have nothing to do with benefiting the country and the people. These are not sufficient reasons to mitigate the sentence. It is considered that he committed the crime of conspiring with the enemy to plot to rebel against his own country under Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, which is not without merit. However, the participation of the defendant in the puppet organization was due to losing his position as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior of the National Government, and failing to move westward with the government. After he took up the puppet post, after Liang Hongzhi and Wang Zhaoming formed the puppet government, he did not think of finding an opportunity to sneak into the rear and serve the central government, but always relied on the enemy puppets and held puppet posts. It cannot be relieved of the crime of treason, but compared to the ringleaders who deliberately used the enemy's force to subvert our government, the situation is different. Regarding the Father of the Nation's Mausoleum, the negotiation for the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the organization of a guard team for protection, although it was the duty of the puppet mayor, still reflects a slight reverence for the lofty and great Father of the Nation. The facts that he contacted Xu Mingcheng to provide information to the central government, and rescued and assisted the central underground workers Ma Yuanfang, Chen Lixing, and Wang Wenjun, have been proven by the witnesses Deng Jiecun, Yu Pangrong, and Wang Wenjun who appeared in court, and there are also letters from Xu Mingcheng, Ma Yuanfang, and Chen Lixing to prove it. Although the provision of information was not implemented, and the rescue of resistance workers, based on the process, was not entirely an emotional impulse. Taking these considerations into account, although it cannot be reduced to the end, measuring the situation and crime, it is not impossible to commute him from death. The original judgment was sentenced to death, and it is somewhat heavy. It should be revoked by this court, and sentenced to life imprisonment within the statutory original penalty, in order to show caution. The petition and the defense's intention to attack the original trial, the matters that are beneficial to the defendant, have not fulfilled the duty of investigation, and the application of law does not refer to the legal meaning of Article 3 of the Regulations on the Handling of Traitor Cases and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan No. 3101, which is illegal. It is not sufficient to be taken, but the criticism that the original sentence is too heavy is not entirely without reason. Based on the above discussion, it should be based on Article 22, Paragraph 1, the former paragraph of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Ordinance, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, Paragraph 1, the former paragraph, Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and the verdict is as stated in the main text.</p>

The court ruled that Hayes is entitled to extraterritorial rights under the Zi Ben Agreement signed between our country and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and therefore, the case against him will not be accepted.

<h3>Shanghai's 72 Japanese War Criminals: Their Heinous Crimes are Obvious; Most Have Been Arrested. Judicial Authorities Request Joint Cooperation from Legal Groups to Report on Them, Hoping Various Sectors Will Provide Strong Evidence.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The names of 72 major Japanese war criminals in this city have already been listed by the Ministry of National Defense, and an official document has been sent to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has instructed the local judicial authorities in this city to be responsible for investigating their confirmed crimes. In order to gather collective wisdom, the judicial authorities have promptly copied and distributed the lists of war criminals, along with their ranks and crimes, to various legal groups and organizations in society, requesting joint cooperation in reporting them. They also hope that various sectors will provide strong evidence so that the war criminals can be brought to trial as soon as possible and given the punishment they deserve. Most of the 72 war criminals have already been arrested and are being detained in the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao. However, there are still some who have not been apprehended as of now, and they are currently being actively pursued. Here are some of the most famous and egregious offenders:</p>
<p>Okazaki Kahira, Counselor of the Embassy, assisted the military in disrupting our economy and planned to illegally plunder various materials in Central China.</p>
<p>Yano Seiki, Consul General, guided the head of the Japanese Residents' Association and the general Japanese residents.</p>
<p>Toyota Mu, Consul General, was responsible for guiding the general Japanese residents.</p>
<p>Iwai Eiichi, Vice-Consul, colluded with Yuan Ludeng and others to undermine our economy and engage in intelligence activities.</p>
<p>Hosono Yoshihisa, Judicial Consul, instructed embassy staff to illegally abuse Chinese people.</p>
<p>Kariya Kyuta, Embassy Appointee, used his position to oppress our good citizens and committed all kinds of evil.</p>
<p>Sasaki Shiro, Military Police Appointee, using the name of the military police and consular appointees, monopolized gambling tables in western Shanghai, profited from them, and established intelligence agencies to kill our patriotic youth. He is the most vicious of the ruffians, and currently possesses several hundred million yuan in private assets and two concubines.</p>
<p>Mitsui Yonematsu, Chairman of the China-Japan Trade Federation. The association was the largest military procurement agency in Central China. Using the power of the military, it forcibly purchased rice, grains, livestock, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cotton, and oils.</p>
<p>Yoshida Yujiro, Standing Director of the China-Japan Trade Federation, was responsible for purchasing rayon, raw silk, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, hardware, copper, iron, and various local products and groceries. The association was invested in by Mitsui &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Masao, Branch Manager of Mitsui &amp; Co., was the largest and most influential military procurement merchant in China. He used the power of the military to forcibly purchase and sell rice.</p>
<p>Reita Tatsuma, Branch Manager of Mitsui &amp; Co., was responsible for purchasing grains, oils, raw silk, rayon, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, fertilizer, pigments, steel, hardware, machinery, sugar, paper, ginseng, medicine, tea, matches, and cement.</p>
<p>Tsuruta Takeshi, Branch Manager of Mitsui &amp; Co., was responsible for purchasing tobacco, beer, woolen goods, wood, coal, seafood, and various local products, as well as handling water and land transportation and insurance businesses. (It is verified that Mitsui &amp; Co. is one of Japan's largest financial groups. Successive Ministers of Finance were promoted by the group's influence. In this Sino-Japanese War, it first instigated the military and the government to establish the Asia Development Board to monopolize the economic power of our occupied areas. Later, due to the exposure of corruption among the personnel of the Asia Development Board, it was abolished and replaced with the Greater East Asia Ministry to avoid public criticism. In reality, it was just a change in name, and it implemented a controlled economy in our occupied areas, forcibly purchasing various major materials at the lowest prices and then selling them to our merchants at high prices, profiting from them. The group's senior staff members all accumulated great wealth.)</p>
<p>Awasawa Toshikaku, Chairman of Wanwa Company, was the largest military procurement merchant in Central China, purchasing rice, grains, yarn, hardware, steel, alcohol, and various local products and groceries. Because he used coercive means to purchase them, he obtained tens of billions of yuan (in puppet currency). Each senior staff member has privately amassed a great fortune. It is also verified that the company collected a large amount of alcohol, which was used to supply the army, navy, and air force. When the enemy army surrendered, he embezzled the military's alcohol, worth approximately hundreds of millions of yuan in puppet currency.</p>
<p>Sakurai Takeo, Shanghai Branch Manager of the Imperial Bank, and Kiyonaga Kenji, Sub-Branch Manager. This bank is operated by the Mitsui conglomerate, formerly known as the Mitsui Bank, now renamed the Imperial Bank. It normally manipulates domestic finance in Japan, bribes the military, and promotes war to fulfill its ambitions of economic invasion. It is truly the culprit of this Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, when the Allied forces entered Japan, they first dissolved this financial group. When the enemy army was fighting in Central China, it deposited most of the military funds into the Shanghai branch. This branch spared no effort in invading China's economy and disrupting its finances. It also provided low-interest loans to various procurement merchants to allow them to develop as much as possible. When the enemy army surrendered, it embezzled a large amount of the enemy army's deposits and distributed them to branch staff members at the section chief level and above.

<h3>Production Loan Review Committee Decides on Two Major Points Yesterday</h3>
<p>Old Debts of Industrial and Mining Enterprises May Not Be Deducted from New Loans; Debts to Commercial Firms Must Be Negotiated Independently</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans held its fourth regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building, with over 20 committee members present. During the meeting, Chairman Huo Baoshu was in Beijing, so Standing Committee Member Li Fucun served as temporary chairman. Several important cases were discussed, and two points were announced after the meeting: (1) When industrial and mining enterprises apply for loans from the Production Loan Association, if they have already obtained loans from various national banks, the old debts will not be deducted from the new loans. (2) If there are old debts with commercial firms, the loan applicants should negotiate a solution with the commercial firms on their own and then submit it to the Production Loan Association for approval.</p>
<p>In addition, the committee has decided on the interest rate for production enterprise loans. The interest rate for national banks and commercial firms to grant loans is uniformly 4% per month.</p>
<p>According to Article 7 of the committee's regulations, "The Central Bank shall, at any time, accept mortgages from various banks based on the approved terms." It is learned that the committee decided at its third regular meeting that when national banks re-mortgage to the Central Bank, the loan amount will be calculated at 80% of the actual loan amount, and the interest rate will be 2.8% per month. When commercial firms re-mortgage to the Central Bank, the loan amount will also be calculated at 80% of the actual loan amount, and the interest rate will be 2% per month.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned determined re-mortgage interest rate, the actual interest earned by national banks for granting production vehicle loans is 8.8% per month, and the actual interest earned by commercial firms is 12% per month.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation's Unprecedented Selling Pressure, Sugar Prices Continue to Rise Consistently</h3>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, sugar sales are booming, and there is a shortage of spot goods, the rising trend has intensified. Yesterday, the market rose across the board. Medium granulated sugar rose by 3,000 yuan, raw sugar jumped by 7,000 yuan, and Xinghua white and red high-quality goods were highly sought after. Green sugar also rose in price. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation broke its record for allocation yesterday, with 28,000 bags of medium granulated sugar, 18,000 bags of raw sugar, 6,000 bags of refined white sugar, 1,300 bags of Taiwan red sugar, and 1,700 bags of coarse sugar, totaling 55,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten, and numbered goods continued to rise in price. For example, Guang Bang's Runde green sugar rose by another 2,300 yuan, reaching as high as 100,000 yuan, and 95,000-96,000 yuan, accounting for more than 500 bags. More than 100 boxes of Qingyuan thin green sugar were priced at 96,000-97,000 yuan, an increase of 11,000 yuan. Shantou green sugar was relatively flat, opening at 103,000 yuan, accounting for more than 100 bags. Jian Bang's red Zhang Diao sugar opened at 110,000 yuan, with hundreds of bags traded.

It is said to be of excellent quality and reasonably priced, which is in line with the needs of the international market.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials are Selling Well, Caustic Soda is in Short Supply, Users are Ordering One After Another, Chilean Nitrate Rises Sevenfold, Sichuan Wax Sells for 2 Million</h3>
<p>Caustic soda is in short supply, and there are many buyers, so the market price is high. It is learned that ICI caustic soda will be directly distributed to various user factories starting next week. It is said that the price per barrel for the aforementioned distribution may still be over 600,000 yuan, and even if the allocation price is increased, it should not exceed 100,000 yuan. In view of the seriousness of the caustic soda problem, various user factories have placed large orders with a certain foreign firm in this city, with a price of 480,000 yuan per barrel, which can arrive in February next year, with a 30% deposit paid in advance. According to users in the market, various factories (whether printing and dyeing mills or soap factories) are currently in a period of intense production. Due to the shortage of caustic soda, it not only affects production costs, but also reduces output. It is hoped that relevant parties will understand the seriousness of this problem and clear the caustic soda accumulated at the docks in advance, so that the supply of caustic soda will increase and the problem can be easily alleviated. In addition, the market price of Chilean nitrate (also known as sodium nitrate) was 4 million yuan per ton two weeks ago, but yesterday the market price rose sharply to 28 million yuan per ton, and those who hold the goods are reluctant to sell them. According to raw material merchants, although a large number of imported specialty raw materials have arrived, they have not been delivered. The price of specialty raw materials related to dyes and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics has risen sharply due to the scarcity of goods in the market. Glycerin has been sought after by tobacco factories, etc. Yesterday, the price per lot exceeded 300,000, and there is a severe shortage of spot goods. The momentum of iron漲is still there. Sichuan wax has now risen to 2 million yuan per Dan for the rice heart tooth opening cake. According to people in the industry, the price of wax in Hankou has risen to more than 3 million per Dan, and since the city is currently experiencing a period of unusually prosperous sales, it is possible that it will double again.</p>

<h3>England Needs Chinese Tea - Import Quantity Falls Short of Expectations - Import Permits Specially Extended</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 19th) It is reported that the Food Ministry has extended the deadline for Chinese tea import permits, initially set for December 31st, to March 31st, 1947.

Sesame oil from Bengbu, Hankou, and Wangbei arrived in good quantities, resulting in a stable situation and ensuring a sufficient supply.</p>
<h3>Interview with Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the Textile Construction Corporation - Steps for Improving and Promoting Cotton Planting</h3>
<p>Import of Foreign Cotton is Currently China's Biggest Leak - Production Can Be Restored to Former Levels in Three Years</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Cotton is originally one of China's special products. Taking the annual production volume before the war as an example, it was already able to be self-sufficient. And the cotton for yarn spun by textile groups could even be supplied for export with a surplus. However, during the eight years of war, the countryside suffered thorough destruction. The normal production volume of cotton was the first to bear the brunt. Last year's situation need not be mentioned; this year, the national production volume is estimated to be 7 million dan (担) based on reliable estimates. However, the actual amount available for purchase and spinning by various yarn factories is minimal. As a result, we have had to resort to importing foreign cotton. Looking at the monthly import values published by customs over the past year, raw cotton has consistently been the top item, with import volumes far exceeding those of other imported goods. According to accurate estimates: out of the total national import value of over US$650 million in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), raw cotton alone accounted for over US$160 million. What an alarming foreign exchange leakage! Therefore, it is imperative to improve the cotton planting plan and promote the movement to increase raw cotton production. Because the implementation of this plan fulfills many missions. It solves most of the rural economic problems, saves China from a huge foreign exchange expenditure, and resolves the raw material problem for cotton cloth, which has the largest consumption volume among the people.</p>
<p>With this premise in mind, the reporter had a long conversation with Mr. Wu Weijing, the current Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation. Mr. Wu is an expert in the study of cotton trade and cotton production and sales. Since graduating from Tianjin Cotton College in his early years, he has dedicated half his life to the improvement of the cotton industry. He has traveled extensively to cotton-producing areas in China, Japan, and Korea. From hands-on experience and actual trials, he has found the basis for his improvement plan.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Basin - The World's Most Ideal Cotton Planting Area</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said it well, in terms of weather and soil quality, it is unlikely that one could find a more ideal environment for cotton planting than the Yellow River Basin. There, autumn brings clear skies and refreshing air, and the soil is mostly sandy loam, producing the largest cotton bolls. The Yangtze River Basin is also an ideal cotton-planting area, but the climate is not as dry as the Yellow River Basin. In conclusion, China's cotton-planting area extends as far south as Hainan Island, and as far north as beyond the Great Wall, to the northeast, Shenyang, to the east reaching the coast, and to the west reaching Sichuan. Therefore, except for Mongolia, Xinjiang, and mountainous areas in the southwest, almost no land in the country is unsuitable for cotton planting.</p>
<p>Pre-War Production - The Fastest Progress Was Made After the 16th Year of the Republic of China (1927)</p>
<p>Speaking of agriculture as a whole, China has had more than 40 years of agricultural improvement history. And to this day, the most remarkable achievement is cotton. From the perspective of production volume, according to records from the Yarn Factory Association in the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), China's annual cotton production was estimated at 3 million dan (老秤), which had expanded to over 14 million dan (老秤) by the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. Among these, the decade from the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) saw the fastest increase. In terms of quality, it has also progressed from the initial raw material for 10-count yarn to the raw material for 42-count and even 60-count yarn by the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. This improvement in quality is due to: (1) the rapid development of the textile industry; (2) the implementation of the legal tender policy; (3) the huge amount of cotton cloth consumed in China; and (4) the vastness of China's cotton-planting area.</p>
<p>Yunnan Kapok - Praised by Foreigners as China's Treasure</p>
<p>In addition to the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, there are three other areas worthy of attention: First, the kapok in Yunnan. This kapok is completely different from that produced in Guangdong. It is rich in crimp, has tensile strength, and can spin 60-count yarn. The biggest feature is that it is a perennial plant. Once planted, it can be harvested twice a year from the third year onwards. Once in June-July, and once in November-December. The most kapok is produced near Kaiyuan, Yunnan, with an annual production of 2,000-3,000 dan. Foreigners even praise it as China's treasure. Currently, there is a Yunnan Kapok Company jointly funded by the government and private sector, developing and propagating it there. Second, sea island cotton, produced on Hainan Island, can be said to be the most excellent cotton in the world. This cotton is similar to that produced in Florida and Mexico in the United States. The fiber is fine and long, and can be spun into 200-240 count western yarn. It is currently in the trial planting stage. Third, coarse lint from Xihua and Xiaogan. This cotton is the coarsest and hardest cotton in the world, most suitable for weaving carpets with wool. Before the war, annual exports often reached 200,000-300,000 dan. If it can be propagated and increased in production for export, the foreign exchange that can be earned each year would also be considerable.</p>
<p>Domestication of American Varieties - China Has Achieved Considerable Success</p>
<p>Next, talking about cotton experiments and promotion methods, they can be roughly divided into two types: One is breeding, which involves selecting superior cotton varieties with long fibers and high yields. When they mature and bloom, artificial pollination is performed to prevent mixing with inferior varieties, and then gradually expanding their propagation. The other is selection, which involves selecting particularly excellent cotton seeds, isolating them from other cotton varieties, and selecting other plots of land to nurture and propagate them. China currently mostly adopts the second method, selecting and purchasing excellent American cotton seeds, attempting to domesticate them, and then propagating them.</p>
<p>After China adopted the second method for propagation, there are currently three of the most excellent varieties: The first is StoneVille No.4, which is suitable for planting from the Yellow River Basin to the latitude of Tianjin and Baoding. Its characteristics are: (1) The fiber is 1 inch long and can spin 32-42 count cotton yarn. (2) The average diameter of the seed is 1 and 32/1 inch. (3) The yield is high. (4) It matures early. (5) The lint percentage is extremely high, with 33 jin (斤) of lint cotton ginned from 100 jin of seed cotton. Therefore, this variety has been extensively propagated in the North China area. The second is Delfos No. 531. This variety has established a foundation in the Yangtze River Basin. And especially this year's trial planting results are even more remarkable. Its characteristics are: (1) The fiber is 1 and 16/1 inch long and can spin 42-62 count cotton yarn. (2) The yield is also high. (3) The lint percentage is also good. However, the climate in the Yangtze River Basin is relatively humid, and the rainy season each year is suitable for planting, but the time is somewhat rushed. It is still in the trial planting stage, and large-scale production awaits next year. The third is Guannong No. 1, produced from eastern Hebei northward to the Liao River Basin. This variety was cultivated by the Japanese. Its characteristics are: (1) The fiber is 70% of an inch long and can spin 20-32 count cotton yarn. (2) It matures extremely early. The three varieties mentioned above are the most important of China's improved cotton varieties.</p>
<p>Improvement and Promotion - Mr. Wu's Plan is Divided into Three Steps</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wu presented his personal three-part plan for improving and promoting China's cotton. The first step is to establish original seed farms in all cotton-producing areas of the country. According to his estimation, there should be more than 20 original seed farms nationwide. Each farm should have a propagation farm built around it, forming a wave-shaped expansion. The second step is to implement centralized ginning. This will reduce the chances of seed mixing, and the lint cotton can also maintain consistency. This method was particularly effective when implemented by the Japanese in Northeast China. It can gradually eliminate bad seeds and purify the varieties. Therefore, machine ginning factories should be established in all improved cotton areas, with attached packing factories, oil pressing factories, etc., to facilitate the work. After the seeds and lint cotton have been processed through the above two steps, the final step is to inspect and grade the cotton, so that the quality of cotton is standardized. If this step cannot be achieved, then there will never be a way to sell national cotton at a good price.</p>
<p>If the above three-part plan can be fully implemented, it is estimated that China's cotton production volume can be restored to the state before the Anti-Japanese War within three years. This year, because the recovery has not yet been completed, it can only be called a preparatory year for cotton planting, with an estimated production of 7 million dan. Next year, preparations will continue, and it can be increased to 9 million dan. In the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948), it is expected to increase to 13 million dan, and in the 38th year of the Republic of China (1949), it is expected to reach the pre-war level, which is roughly 17 million dan. If the situation tends to stabilize, then with the cooperation of these three steps, a cotton production volume of 17 million dan should absolutely be achievable in three years.</p>
<p>Completing the Plan - The Following Conditions Must Be Resolved First</p>
<p>However, to achieve these three steps, Mr. Wu believes that the following prerequisites must be resolved: (1) Financial issues: The profits from the cotton spinning business of the Textile Construction Corporation should still be returned to the cotton spinning business. In particular, a large portion of the funds must be used to improve cotton, so that agriculture can be industrialized and mechanical cultivation and irrigation can be fully utilized. On the one hand, this saves labor, and on the other hand, it allows for large-scale production. Only then can the goals of improving quality and reducing production costs be achieved. (2) A large number of talents should be cultivated. Studying abroad is certainly necessary, but a large number of mid-level cadres should also be cultivated domestically. (3) A large number of excellent American varieties should be purchased to prepare for large-scale propagation. (4) A national cotton improvement organization should be established, dividing the country into regions based on differences in climate and soil quality. Each region should then set up several guidance centers as needed. With these three-level organizations, the work of improving and expanding the cotton industry should be more than sufficient.</p>
<p>This is a summary of Mr. Wu's plan to improve China's cotton industry. Mr. Wu is a person who advocates finding the basis for his plans from practical experience. Therefore, his plan should be more practical and further-reaching than general theoretical improvement plans. He has just extensively inspected the cotton-planting areas in Northeast China, the Yellow River Basin, the Pinghan Railway, and the Yangtze River Basin this autumn. He has brought back an optimistic outlook for China's cotton production situation. May the reporter personally witness, on a clear autumn day next year, that the fertile fields across the country have all become boundless cotton fields!</p>

Both Yang and Chen were resting, while Feng Chen fought fiercely. Both focused on the loss and gain of this game's right to the finals, so more steadily and defensively. However, Feng Hao was more aggressive, resulting in many missed shots, ultimately leading to his elimination. Yang Kaiyun then played against Chen Zengliang again, and Yang, rested, avenged his first defeat and won the championship in the final group. The results of each player are as follows: Yang Kaiyun, 5 wins, champion; Chen Zengliang, 4 wins, 1 loss, runner-up; Feng Hao, 3 wins, 2 losses; Jiang Boquan, 2 wins, 3 losses; Zhu Kuangchen, 1 win, 4 losses; Zhu Zongze, 5 losses.</p>

<p>The review of the credentials of the representatives was conducted by this committee in its first meeting held at 8:00 PM on November 29th, where three review methods were determined: (1) Review of the election certificates in accordance with Article 7 of the Wartime Regulations; (2) Mutual review of the election certificates by the review committee members themselves; (3) The committee members are divided into 19 groups according to their respective electoral units for review. Subsequently, in the second meeting held at 8:00 PM on December 5th, the election certificates and supporting documents of a total of 1,583 individuals were reviewed and approved. For those who had not submitted their certificates, two additional methods were decided upon: (1) If representatives had lost their election certificates, failed to obtain replacements in time, or forgot to bring them, written proof from two or more representatives from the same province/region, or a certificate issued by the relevant electoral office, would be considered valid; (2) For representatives selected by the National Government and representatives from various parties who had not received their election certificates in time, a certificate issued by the National Election Headquarters would also be considered valid. Then, in the third meeting held at 4:00 PM on December 12th, the review continued according to the group review method. In total, the credentials of all 1,697 representatives who had reported their attendance were reviewed and approved.</p>
<p>Draft Constitution</p>
<p>Report of the First Review Committee</p>
<p>A. Scope of Review by This Committee</p>
<p>The scope of review by this committee covers the "Preamble" and Chapter 1 "General Principles," Articles 1 to 7, Chapter 2 "Rights and Obligations of the People," Articles 8 to 25, and Chapter 12 "Elections," Articles 128 to 132, of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>B. Reference Materials for Review</p>
<p>The reference materials for review by this committee include 122 relevant proposals, two volumes of compiled speeches by representatives, and the opinions of the committee members participating in this review.</p>
<p>C. Time of Review and Number of Meetings</p>
<p>The review by this committee began on December 6th. The address for the review meeting was the auditorium of the Lizhi Society. Subsequently, six meetings were held in the conference hall of the Central Party Headquarters, totaling seven meetings, concluding at 12:30 PM on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>During the review meetings, all committee members devoted themselves to careful study and discussion of the articles submitted for review. Articles 1 and 7 were transferred to the Comprehensive Committee for review due to disagreements. Explanations of amendments and major debates are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the "Preamble"</p>
<p>Regarding the "Preamble," committee members voiced many opinions. Some argued that the phrase "according to" was disrespectful, as it is often used in official documents like "according to the report of so-and-so," and should be changed to "in accordance with." After lengthy debate, Committee Member Zhi Ben explained that phrases like "relying on benevolence, based on virtue, indulging in the arts" are not used in a superior-to-inferior context, and that "according to" is different from "based on." Some argued that the title "National Father" should be added before the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and others argued that the phrase "Creator of the Republic of China" should be placed above the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. After a vote, with 157 members present, the original draft was maintained with a majority of 127 votes.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Article 1</p>
<p>This article relates to the form of government, and the representatives attached great importance to it. Thirty-two amendment proposals were submitted, and the committee members spoke enthusiastically. Some, like Representatives Li Junfu and Xia Erkang, argued for the removal of the "Three Principles of the People." Many argued for amending it to "The Republic of China is a Republic of the Three Principles of the People." Their reasoning was that the Three Principles of the People are democratic principles. There were many other deliberative opinions, and after lengthy discussion, five proposals were put to a vote, with 129 people present at the time.</p>
<p>(1) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic: 11 votes in favor</p>
<p>(2) Republic of China is a Unified Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 0 votes in favor</p>
<p>(3) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 58 votes in favor</p>
<p>(4) Republic of China is a Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 48 votes in favor</p>
<p>(5) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People: 26 votes in favor</p>
<p>The results showed that none of the proposals received the required number of votes, except for "The Republic of China is a Unified Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People," which received no votes. At that time, it was already time to adjourn, and there was a proposal to amend it to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People." After the meeting continued in the afternoon, according to Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure, it was reviewed again. After discussion, the two proposals with the most votes from the previous six proposals were put to a vote, with the following results:</p>
<p>(1) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People: 33 votes in favor</p>
<p>(2) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 107 votes in favor</p>
<p>Based on the total results of the vote on this article, it was amended to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People."</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Article 4</p>
<p>Regarding the provisions on territory in this article, some advocated listing them, some advocated maintaining the original draft, and some advocated specifying national borders. In the end, it was generally believed that listing them had both advantages and disadvantages, but the majority believed that changes to the national territory should be subject to the resolution of the National Assembly, and that a general provision was appropriate. At that time, with 129 people present, the amendment was passed with 78 votes, and the wording was "The territory of the Republic of China is based on its inherent boundaries, and may not be altered without the resolution of the National Assembly."</p>
<p>(4) Regarding Article 7</p>
<p>This article, concerning the location of the capital, is of great importance. The representatives submitted a total of 21 proposals regarding this article, and the speeches on this article were well-argued and insightful. Among them, the largest number advocated setting the capital in Peiping. The discussion of this article underwent two heated debates on the 11th and 12th. Finally, all the amendments to this article were put to a vote. At that time, with 192 people present, the voting results were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Delete the original text and do not specify the capital in the constitution: 67 votes in favor</p>
<p>(2) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Nanjing, Peiping, and Xi'an in principle, and shall be implemented separately according to the needs of national construction: 7 votes in favor</p>
<p>(3) The Republic of China shall have Lanzhou as its central capital, Nanjing as its eastern capital, and Kashgar as its western capital: 12 votes in favor</p>
<p>(4) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Lanzhou: 7 votes in favor</p>
<p>(5) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Xi'an: 7 votes in favor</p>
<p>(6) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Wuhan: 9 votes in favor</p>
<p>(7) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Peiping: 117 votes in favor</p>
<p>This article was amended to "The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Peiping." After the decision was made, those who advocated maintaining the original draft requested that maintaining the original draft be put to a vote again. The result was 63 votes in favor of maintaining the original draft. The amendment "The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Peiping" was still passed.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding Article 9</p>
<p>This article concerns the protection of human rights. The committee members all felt that it must be carefully reviewed, otherwise it would not be sufficient to protect human rights comprehensively. After a long discussion, the committee members had many opinions. Some argued that the establishment of this article should remove Article 24, otherwise it would be a restriction on this article, and the people would still not be able to obtain sufficient protection. Others argued that the facts of public order and other issues should be taken into account, and the government should not be restricted so strictly. As a result, for careful consideration, Zhang Zhiben, He Jihong, Ji Qingyi, Mou Zhendong, and Zou Liankui were designated as the text organizers of this article. After sorting out, the draft amendment was passed at the afternoon continuation meeting as follows:</p>
<p>"The freedom of the person of the people shall be protected. Except for arrests of offenders in the act, as otherwise stipulated by law; arrests and detentions shall not be made without the legal procedures of judicial or police organs. Arrests, detentions, interrogations, and punishments by courts without legal procedures may be refused.</p>
<p>When a person is arrested or detained on suspicion of a crime, the arresting or detaining organ shall inform the person and his designated relatives and friends in writing of the reasons for the arrest or detention. And, at the latest, transfer the person to the competent court for interrogation within twenty-four hours. The person or others may also petition the competent court to submit the person to the arresting organ for interrogation within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The court shall not refuse the aforementioned petition, and shall not order the arresting or detaining organ to respond first. The arresting and detaining organ shall not refuse or delay the court's interrogation.</p>
<p>When a person is illegally arrested or detained by any organ, the person or others may petition the court to investigate, and the court shall not refuse. And it shall investigate the arresting and detaining organ within twenty-four hours and handle it according to law."</p>
<p>At that time, with 121 people present, it was passed without objection.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding Article 16</p>
<p>The original draft of this article concerns the property rights of the people. During the discussion, it was generally believed that the property rights of the people should be protected. However, the right to survival and the right to work of those without property should also be protected. Otherwise, this constitution would only protect the property of those with property, which would be contrary to the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and would become a drawback that favors the capitalist class. Therefore, this article was amended to "The people's right to survival, right to work, and property rights shall be protected." At that time, with 88 people present, the amendment was passed with 71 votes.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding Article 21</p>
<p>This article is a provision on the national service of the people. However, the amendment by Representative Bai Chongxi and others considered that national defense requires not only military service but also labor service. During the review, the majority thought it was very appropriate. However, many of the review committee members felt that the state should also be responsible for providing relief and compensation for cases of disability or death caused by the people's service in the military or labor service. Therefore, it was decided to amend this article to "The people have the obligation to perform military service and labor service according to law" and to add the second clause as follows: "If a person becomes ill, disabled, or dies as a result of performing such military or labor service, the state shall provide appropriate relief or compensation to the person or his family." At that time, with 82 people present, it was passed with 53 votes.</p>
<p>(8) Regarding Chapter 12 Elections</p>
<p>This chapter is a provision on elections. During the review, it was generally believed that it did not comply with the previously passed Article 18 of the original draft constitution, which stated "The people have the right to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum." The draft chapter only provides for elections, which is a omission. The provisions on the right to recall are only provided for in Article 132, which is also insufficient. The name of this chapter is also proposed to be amended. After passing the original draft Articles 128 to 132, according to Proposal No. 366, an amendment by Representative Lin Bin and others, it was passed to amend the name of this chapter to "Election, Recall, Initiative, and Referendum." Article 133 was added: "Recall shall be initiated by more than one-quarter of the voters in the original electoral district and decided by a majority vote." Article 134 "The exercise of the right of initiative shall be carried out in one of the following ways, depending on the nature and complexity of the matter: One, drafting a bill. Two, formulating legal principles." Article 135 "The bill drafted in accordance with Article 134 shall be sent to the government's legislative organ to complete the legislative procedure; the formulation of legislative principles shall be carried out by the legislative organ in accordance with the principles to formulate laws or regulations, which shall be sent to the government for promulgation." Article 136 "Referendum shall be conducted when one of the following circumstances occurs, except as otherwise provided in this constitution: One, to abolish certain laws or regulations. Two, to change the legislative organ's decision that a complete bill is not established." Article 137 "After the referendum, it shall be implemented by the method and decided by the majority of the referendum voters, except as otherwise provided by law."</p>
<p>The amendment to this chapter was passed with a majority of 39 votes out of 65 people present.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the explanatory note to this chapter, during the discussion of the original draft Article 128, Representative Xia Erkang strongly advocated amending this article to adopt the proportional representation system in large electoral districts. Although some representatives seconded it, the majority ultimately believed that this system was not suitable for the current situation in China. It was rejected, but Representative Xia still declared that he reserved the right to speak.</p>
<p>Conveners of the First Review Committee: Zhang Zhiben, Huang Shaogu, Xia Erkang, Li Junfu, Chen Yiyun, Zhuo Yishan, Qi Zhiyuan, Ren Zhuoxuan, Liu Yaozhang</p>
<p>Report of the Second Review Committee</p>
<p>The scope of review by this committee is Chapter 3 "National Assembly" and Chapter 14 "Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution" of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China. In the first and second meetings, the proposals were not sorted out and issued, and the review was difficult, resulting in few results. Later, in the third meeting on the morning of December 10th, the representatives unanimously decided to entrust the conveners to sort out and summarize the proposals first and then submit them for discussion. The sorting principles decided by the meeting were three: (1) Review all relevant proposals without omission; (2) The attitude must be objective and subjective opinions must not be added; (3) The proposals of the same nature must be summarized and sorted into articles. The conveners convened a meeting to work immediately after the adjournment at 9:30 AM that day, and based on the above three principles, they made a sorting report on Chapter 3 and Chapter 14, which was completed at 10:30 PM that evening. Subsequent meetings mostly proceeded on this basis.</p>
<p>During the proceedings of the various meetings, whenever major issues were encountered and the opinions of the two sides were too far apart, the conveners and some representatives proposed that the different opinions of the two sides be recorded together and sent to the Comprehensive Review Committee for processing, but this was not adopted, so a voting method was used to decide the matter by majority.</p>
<p>In total, this committee held seven review meetings from the 6th of this month to 1:00 PM on the 14th, excluding five convener meetings. The representatives argued fiercely about the nature, organization, and political power of the National Assembly. The results of the discussion are as follows:</p>
<p>I. Add a new article to Chapter 3 "National Assembly":</p>
<p>"Article: The National Assembly is the highest organ representing the people of the Republic of China in exercising political power."</p>
<p>II. Delete the original Article 26, paragraph 1 "Legislators directly elected from each region and the Mongolian leagues and Tibet" and paragraph 2 "Supervisory Committee members elected by the provincial assemblies and the local assemblies of the Mongolian leagues and Tibet," that is, legislators and supervisory committee members shall not be constituent members of the National Assembly. Add three other clauses specifying the proportional election quota of regional representatives, representatives elected from each Mongolian banner and Tibet, representatives elected from occupational groups, and representatives elected from women's groups. The full text of this article as amended is:</p>
<p>"The National Assembly shall be composed of the following representatives:</p>
<p>1. One representative shall be elected from each county, city, and equivalent region, but for every 300,000 people exceeding 300,000, one additional representative shall be elected. The equivalent region of the county and city shall be determined by law.</p>
<p>2. The number of representatives elected from each Mongolian banner and Tibet shall be determined by law.</p>
<p>3. The number of representatives elected by nationals residing abroad shall be determined by law.</p>
<p>4. The number of representatives elected from occupational groups shall be determined by law.</p>
<p>5. The number of representatives elected from women's groups shall be determined by law."</p>
<p>III. Regarding the powers of the National Assembly in Article 27, the majority of the representatives believed that they should be expanded. In addition to the originally stipulated election of the president and vice president, it should have the power to elect the presidents and vice presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, as well as legislators and supervisory committee members. In addition to impeaching the president and vice president, it should have the power to impeach the presidents and vice presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, as well as legislators and supervisory committee members. Add the powers of "initiating laws," "referring laws," "amending the constitution," and "other powers conferred by the constitution." The full text of this article as amended is: "The powers of the National Assembly are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Elect the president, vice president, presidents and vice presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, and legislators and supervisory committee members.</p>
<p>2. Impeach the president, vice president, presidents and vice presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, and legislators and supervisory committee members.</p>
<p>3. Initiate laws</p>
<p>4. Refer laws</p>
<p>5. Amend the constitution, but not change the form of government</p>
<p>6. Other powers conferred by this constitution</p>
<p>Some representatives and representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party stated on the spot that they could not agree to the above three amendments and reserved the right to speak at the general meeting. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union's Artistic Wasteland: Criticism from Female Writer Rubissa</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>People often assume that Soviet literature and art are entirely new and possess a progressive spirit; however, this is not always the case. At least in the realm of art, it is somewhat lagging behind. Modern new art, whether in painting or sculpture, often cannot exist in the Soviet Union. Progressive painters generally have no place to stand in the Soviet Union, a fact known to the world. Therefore, their talents can only develop abroad, especially in the art capital of Paris. For example, world-renowned artists like Kandinsky, as well as leading figures of the "Paris School" such as Marc Chagall and Chaim Soutine, were all Soviet-born painters. However, facing various restrictions and feeling stifled in their homeland, they resolutely left their country and sought refuge in the world's artistic center - Paris. There, they applied their uninhibited minds, fulfilled their highest aspirations, and became first-class talents in the modern art world. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union itself presented an artistic wasteland. Today, art in the Soviet Union can no longer be independent and has become a tool for government propaganda, which is not welcomed by progressive artists.</p>
<p>Recently, a book on Soviet art was published in the United States, titled "Art in Russia," written by Helen Rubissow, a Soviet female writer who went to the United States eight years ago. She resides in New York, specializing in writing art criticism, and no longer plans to return home. Ms. Rubissow is a graduate of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts in Russia. In her book, there are 160 illustrations, half of which are representative works by contemporary Soviet artists, and the other half are works by Russian artists who have emigrated abroad and are recognized as famous writers by the world. By comparing them, the so-called "modern Soviet art" is clearly exposed to what extent it is restricted and reduced in standard.</p>
<p>In this book, Ms. Rubissow says: "Since the October Revolution, the period of survival for emerging art in the Soviet Union has been very short. In his revolutionary declaration in 1921, Lenin referred to the works of left-wing modern artists as 'childish.' Since the publication of this declaration, progressive writers and painters have unanimously left their country one after another to develop their abilities in Europe and the United States."</p>
<p>She also said: "The flourishing emerging art scene in the Soviet Union at the time was akin to being doused with cold water. Artists felt deeply unaccustomed to various harsh restrictions and constraints. While the government wanted to promote the restoration of rigid, outdated so-called academic painting, writers who were infected with new ideas were uninterested in creating art unless they left the country. They neither liked to imitate, nor could their creations be freely expressed due to restrictions, forcing many writers to simply abandon their painting tools and stop playing this tune."</p>
<p>With the passage of time, after Stalin came to power, the number of painters willing to be employed by the government increased day by day. Stalin vigorously promoted the so-called "socialist realism." But what exactly are these so-called "socialist realism" paintings? According to Ms. Rubissow, "They are nothing more than stories conveying the 'sentimentalism' left over from the 19th century. Their themes are nothing more than mothers holding their children, trudging alone through snow-covered plains; or a young woman and her children sadly gazing at ruins; or a group of women watching soldiers bravely fighting. More recently, there have also been scenes of women watching tanks charging into battle in Stalingrad."</p>
<p>She also said: "...The Soviet Union restricts the scope of artists' work in such a way that if the content of a work (including color and composition) does not conform to the government's doctrine and theme, the writer will be summoned by the government for reprimand or even punishment. The writer's works are constantly being secretly investigated. And every writer must be absolutely responsible to the government, and the writer himself has absolutely no freedom."</p>
<p>Art that is controlled in this way is bound to be unable to approach world art. Modern art, represented by the "Paris School," is an art that expresses the writer's personality, ideals, and soul. From this perspective, if Soviet art is indeed as Ms. Rubissow says, then it is still circling in the mid-19th century, and it is enough to compare it to the works of the British "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood" at that time.

<h3>Introduction to Zhou Xiang's Painting Manual</h3>
<p>— Ding Jianxing</p>
<p>My late teacher, Mr. Zhou Xiang, was an old Jiangnan painter. He was exquisite in metal and stone inscription, calligraphy, and painting; and he mastered the methods of various masters of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties with ease. He also believed that neglecting tradition and forgetting one's ancestors was something only uncultured people would do. Therefore, he created this painting manual based on his lifelong learning and experience to benefit beginners. When Mr. Zheng Wuchang saw it, he praised it, saying: "The lessons taught in this manual are credible and will be passed down to future generations. It and the landscape methods of the recluse of Yuequan can be equally valued for millennia." Mr. Chen Dingshan said: "I foresee that when this book is published, the Mustard Seed Garden Manual can be discarded." I have cherished the ambition of printing and distributing this work for nearly thirty years. Now, I am fortunate to have spent half a year preparing for its publication, which will be sold by the stationery department of Wing On Company. I have kept my promise, and I feel as if a heavy burden has been lifted. The only regret is that the cost is too high, and the price seems expensive. I hope that the virtuous people of the world will understand. As it is about to be passed down to future generations, I respectfully state the main ideas as follows:</p>
<p>This manual is compiled for those who seek to enter the world of landscape painting. Therefore, its arrangement follows the order of learning. The first volume is on methods of drawing trees, because drawing landscapes must start with trees. The second volume is on methods of drawing rocks, because the methods of drawing rocks in ancient and modern times each have their own schools. The third volume is on methods of drawing mountains, so that one can know the structure to write landscapes. The fourth volume is on landscape methods, so that one can have a slight understanding of the origins of landscape painting in ancient and modern times, and thus engage in emulating the ancients, enabling one to ascend the hall and enter the room. If scholars follow this order, study it carefully, and then obtain it, learning landscape painting will surely be successful.</p>

<h3>Schubert</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Schubert (Austrian) His best works during his lifetime were Symphonies and Lieder. His contributions to the latter, especially his insights, were numerous. Among his Lieder works, "The Beautiful Maid of the Mill," "Winterreise" and "Death and the Maiden" are the most famous. Born in 1797, died in 1828.</p>

<h3>George Bernard Shaw</h3>
<p>— Gan Si</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw once lived in Africa. One day he was swimming in a pool, enjoying himself immensely. There were also many children swimming at the time, who did not recognize this great writer at all. One of the children was encouraged by his swimming companions to "push that old man's head into the water." They enticed him with a reward of one shilling.</p>
<p>The child accepted their conditions and swam towards the place where Shaw was lazily paddling. But as he approached the old man, he suddenly became frightened. Shaw turned his head, saw the child, and asked him what he was doing.</p>
<p>The child completely lost his courage, and when asked by the old man, he blurted out the whole story of their bet. Shaw gave the child a stern look and then said, "Okay, if you wait a moment and let me catch my breath, then I can let you push my head into the water."</p>
<p>After they did this, the child swam back happily to collect his shilling.</p>
<h3>Haiku</h3>
<p>— Fei Cun</p>
<p>Grandiose and heroic events are best recounted in lengthy and comprehensive epic poems. Fleeting moments of inspiration should be preserved in concise haiku. As a primary school student said, "Write big characters with a big brush; write small characters with a small brush." This illustrates the idea that "content determines form!"</p>
<p>Japan has what is known as haiku poetry, with writers such as Kobayashi Issa, Basho, and Buson being among its renowned masters. Although my knowledge of what constitutes haiku poetry is limited, I privately believe it is roughly equivalent to what we in China call "short poems." Beyond mere imitation, I have even boldly adopted the name.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 128</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yuanzi had received special agent training, unlike other women, so after arriving at Konoe's secret residence, within a few weeks, she had already taken in the layout of the entire mansion. In addition, she contacted the people who needed to be contacted and understood the things that needed to be understood, all without leaving a trace. According to her investigation, Konoe's place was his villa, actually a key agency. Major national affairs, confidential meetings, and important documents were all handled in this villa. Only his close associates and special agents could enter and exit. In the year before the "July 7th Incident," due to secret agreements, traces of the Fifth Column were added. These Fifth Column members and Konoe were maintained by a so-called "subtle" relationship; nominally, they were his personal employees, serving as advisors, guards, translators, and so on. In reality, these people were the bridge between him and Hitler. One of the key members of this bridge, specializing in espionage, was that one-eyed gentleman, said to be named Divisha Deng.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese have a characteristic: even if you are his confidant, sharing life-and-death secrets with him, as long as you are a foreigner, not a subject of the Emperor, his relationship with you can only maintain eight or nine parts; no matter what, he will reserve one or two parts. It's like his villa building; important figures of the Fifth Column can come and go to places like the conference room, but the Japanese-style hall where Konoe meets with the Emperor is off-limits, even to one-eyed Deng.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this make the allied Fifth Column unhappy? Not necessarily, because every Japanese adult and nobleman has their own "affliction." He explained to the Fifth Column that this "imperial zone" was his Wushan balcony for playing with women and had no political significance, so he wanted "esteemed guests to stop here." Originally, there were only Butterfly Madame-type women serving and attending; even the private secretary could only stop at the first gate.</p>
<p>Thus, Konoe's villa itself was already secret enough; who knew there was a distinction between inner and outer circles? As the saying goes, "A short man has many bumps in his belly." No wonder Konoe's place had a secret within a secret area. However, is the distinction between these inner and outer circles the short man's only bump? No. According to Yuanzi's exploration, behind Konoe's low couch, on the right, was also his bedroom. Only "key concubines" among the concubines could enter here, especially that study. Without orders, concubines on duty were not allowed to take a single step. This was the inner layer of the inner circle.</p>
<p>Yuanzi operated within the inner layer circle for a long time, expending considerable effort. She measured the exterior walls of the building, installed a radio receiver on the screen behind the low couch, and took the opportunity to explore, discovering secret electrical voltage boosters and air circulation devices. Unable to calculate the internal and external power consumption, she concluded that there was a very strong and large underground room in this study.</p>
<p>Initially, the first war criminal of the First World War, German Emperor Wilhelm II, had a most sophisticated and well-equipped underground room, which served as the nerve center for launching the world war. Every night after midnight, he and his chief of intelligence would listen to secret reports from around the world and direct their subordinates to carry out secret operations in various countries. The Japanese were most fond of imitating the Germans, so Konoe also built such an underground room, on the one hand, conducting secret work and, on the other hand, using it as an unexpected air-raid shelter. The so-called unexpected was because the Japanese initially believed that foreign planes could never come to bomb the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>However, Konoe was not a permanent prime minister. This kind of arrangement seemed excessively secret. Once he stepped down, what use would it be? It is not known that in addition to his position in the cabinet, Konoe controlled the operation of two or three secret societies; the Black Dragon Society was one of them. In addition, because he had some "imperial bloodline" connections, he was also a key figure in the "Tenko Shuyu" society. After invading the mainland, annexing East Asia, and dividing the world's hegemony with the Germans, and then having a showdown with the Germans to compete for world domination, Konoe was one of the key figures—secret worms—inherited from Ito Hirobumi and Okuma Shigenobu. Based on the slightest connection; could not each secret worm arrange a small secret underground room?</p>

<h3>North and South</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>According to a letter from a friend in Beiping, the conflict between northern and southern students in various universities is raging. Following the Third Academy of Peking University, Tsinghua University recently launched a poster war between northern and southern students.</p>
<p>We dare not dogmatically say that this is a spread from the dispute over setting the capital of the National Assembly, but it cannot be denied that it has an impact.</p>
<p>The issue of setting the capital naturally does not originate from regional concepts, but after reading the inquiries and replies of Tsinghua students, it is impossible to avoid some emotional reasoning. For example, southern students asked:</p>
<p>(1) Why were Zhou Zuoren and Qian Daosun, traitors, sanctioned by national law?</p>
<p>(2) During the enemy-puppet period, why did the enemy distribute flour to students of puppet universities?</p>
<p>(3) Why didn't you go to the interior?</p>
<p>Northern students replied:</p>
<p>(1) Zhou Zuoren and Qian Daosun were sanctioned by national law for being traitors.</p>
<p>(2) If northern students were traitors for not going to the interior, then all Chinese people who were once ruled by the Manchus would be traitors; how could you be an exception?</p>
<p>(3) The enemy-puppet authorities distributed flour, not exclusively to students. You (X)'s (X)'s also received it without going to the interior: according to logical principles, you (X)'s (X)'s are also traitors.</p>
<p>If this continues, it will easily hurt feelings, and extraneous troubles will erupt at the school.</p>
<p>Exploring truth, seeking right and wrong, especially in schools, we do not oppose debate, but if it goes off track, attacking and criticizing at will, it will lose the demeanor of research.</p>
<p>Universities in Beijing and Shanghai do not yet have such phenomena, and we hope that they will not occur in the future. Whether the South is strong or the North is strong, everyone is Chinese, and it is best to work together to make the entire China prosperous.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Traffic Relapse</h3>
<p>— Wen Hu</p>
<p>Traffic in Shanghai has now reached a state of chaos again. Since Shanghai implemented traffic control, the chaotic situation seemed to have improved a bit, and most of the traffic police were more willing to work hard, but now it has returned to its "normal state," developed its old temper, and the enthusiasm of the traffic police seems to have faded like the yellow "pedestrian crossing lines" painted on the streets.</p>
<p>One of the rules of the previous traffic control was that "empty vehicles are not allowed to enter the central district," but now we can see empty rickshaws and pedicabs driving in the central district at any time and place and parking in places where they should not be parked; of course, these empty vehicles naturally have a corresponding obstruction to the passage of vehicles.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that the Zhejiang Road Bridge suddenly prohibits trucks, rickshaws, and pedicabs from passing. Naturally, these wheels that are not allowed to pass all concentrate on the Xizang Road Bridge, resulting in North Suzhou Road and North Xizang Road being impenetrable. When it is crowded, it takes no less than an hour for a car to reach Nicheng Bridge from the Xizang Road Bridge via Suzhou Road, and sometimes even longer.</p>
<p>Recently, the traffic order on North Xizang Road and North Suzhou Road has been extremely chaotic, especially in the afternoon, when it is almost in a state of "hemiplegia." Now let me write down the congestion situation below:</p>
<p>Every day from afternoon to about 6 pm, the section from the intersection of North Suzhou Road and Wenchang Road to Xizang Road Bridge and then to Nicheng Bridge is the most congested place. When it is impenetrable, all vehicles cannot move a step. Once, I opened the window and saw the Xizang Road Bridge full of congested vehicles, not moving at all. I thought something had happened, but it was not so; it was just that the vehicles were so congested that they could not turn around and it was difficult to move forward or backward. That day, the vehicles lined up from the bridgehead all the way to the Farmers Bank warehouse on North Suzhou Road. The rickshaws and pedicabs were lined up very long, and the dark crowd of people was like the audience in a theater. Of course, rickshaws and pedicabs coming to this kind of road shout bad luck, because what can be reached in an hour now takes two or three hours. Those impatient passengers naturally do not wait long and pay the fare to "walk leisurely." Many business cars coming from the North Station turn around and take other roads when they see that the situation is not right. This is not the case every day, but I would say it is the case eight out of ten days.</p>
<p>However, the Zhejiang Road Bridge, which is only a river away, is very leisurely. Apart from a few trams and cars, there are no other vehicles. It is said that the reason why the Zhejiang Road Bridge prohibits pedicabs, rickshaws, and trucks from passing is because pedicabs collided with trams on the bridge, so it was done for "safety." Of course, we do not oppose this "wise" measure, but we are a little disapproving of this "throwing out the baby with the bathwater" move, because those vehicles that cannot be discharged have no choice but to crowd onto the Xizang Road Bridge. What's more, North Zhejiang Road is the only way for passengers to reach the North Station.</p>
<p>Now the congested traffic situation in Shanghai is naturally not limited to North Xizang Road. The above is just the facts that the writer has seen with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Now the writer puts forward a few questions, hoping that the traffic authorities will review themselves. (1) Is it necessary to change the routes allowed for trucks loading goods depending on the location of the warehouse and the traffic conditions of the pier? Because some routes prohibit the passage of trucks loading goods, some trucks must detour elsewhere to reach their destination. Such detours are enough to increase the congestion of vehicles elsewhere. (2) What remedies are there for the improper prohibition of rickshaws, pedicabs, and trucks from passing through the Zhejiang Road Bridge? (3) When vehicles are congested and cause a partial stoppage of traffic, will the vehicles that caused this chaotic situation be punished as they deserve?</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the authorities will not restore Shanghai's traffic to the chaotic state it was in before (the situation on North Xizang Road has exceeded the past), and should review and improve it practically at any time and place, and must not "throw out the baby with the bathwater"!</p>
<p>News Figures</p>
<h3>Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— Jie Qing</p>
<p>The current chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government is General Luo Zhuoying, styled Youqi, from Dapu, Guangdong. He is 53 years old this year. Although Luo is from Guangdong, he served in the military in Jiangsu and Zhejiang for a longer period and has fewer connections with Lingnan.</p>
<p>Luo graduated from the eighth class of the Artillery Department of the Baoding Military Academy. He was in the same class and the same room as General Chen Cheng. They shared the same ideals and were very close. After leaving school, from 1922, Luo has been assisting Chen in military affairs and has been deeply relied upon. In 1925, when Chen served as the commander of the Capital Garrison, Luo served as the captain of the police art team guarding the gate of the National Government. When important central officials entered and exited, he had to stand at attention and salute as usual. At that time, Luo himself probably did not expect to have today's status.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when Burma became critical, Luo, with the recommendation of General Chen, served as the commander-in-chief of the Burmese Expeditionary Force, a position of glory, envied by all.</p>
<p>Luo's complexion is slightly dark, a little overweight, short in stature, strong in physique, meticulous and gentle, and good at using soldiers, and is also known as the "Ever-Victorious General." Luo came from a poor family. In the midst of military affairs, he did not give up chanting poetry, and often published good works in the "Yuefu" poetry magazine edited by Yu Youren.</p>
<p>Luo's administration of Guangdong still does not depart from the strict methods of governing the army. Therefore, some people use "low air pressure" to describe today's administrative province of Guangdong.</p>
<p>This summer, Luo ordered civil servants not to wear Hong Kong shirts during office hours; recently, at the Guangdong Provincial Administrative Conference, he further stipulated that commissioners and county heads should wear uniform uniforms. From these two points, we can get a glimpse of his style.</p>
<h3>Stealing Urine to Make Secret Medicine</h3>
<p>— Xue Zhen</p>
<p>A few days ago, the article "Little Brother Missing" in this publication mentioned a Chinese medicine called "X Shi" (presumably Qiushi). I remembered that a distant relative of a friend of mine was engaged in this business. One day we also talked about this issue, and he told me many valuable materials.</p>
<p>It is said that "Qiushi" is indeed a good medicine; it can treat postpartum disorders, pulmonary tuberculosis, hemoptysis, and other yin deficiency diseases. Assuming regular consumption, it has the effect of maintaining youth and prolonging life. Moreover, so far, there are very few people and places that manufacture this medicine.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method of "Qiushi" is a secret recipe, only passed on to sons, not to daughters, so as to prevent outsiders from learning it. It is said that the place of my friend's distant relative is one of the best of the few manufacturing places in the country. They do not work at all in spring, summer, and autumn. Only when winter comes do they become busy, trying to find buckets of boys' urine from all over the place. Generally, the source of this boys' urine is nothing more than elementary schools that are relatively close. Giving the school managers some bribes will allow you to collect and pick them endlessly.</p>
<p>When the manufacturing boss (that is, the person who knows this secret method) sees that it is enough, he mixes the medicine in a secret room that outsiders cannot enter, and pours the collected boys' urine into a large pot, heats it on a stove for several days and nights until it is dry, and then adds more, until the prescribed date arrives, then he puts out the fire, and shovels out the snow-white residue remaining in the pot, respectfully and carefully hides it or sells it. The steps of making the medicine are also completely successful. However, the smell is so bad that it stinks for ten miles, and the nearby residents complain and scold, saying that people want to be childless and grandchildren. Therefore, the burning place is mostly chosen in mountains and forests or remote fields to avoid disturbing others.</p>
<p>"Qiushi" is snow-white in color and salty in taste. Drinking it with hot water as salt soup in the morning is the most nourishing thing, but the price is surprisingly expensive. A bag can only be bought for tens of thousands of dollars, which ordinary people cannot afford.</p>
<p>Recently, cases of children often being found after being lost have been discovered in this city. It is speculated that the purpose may be to take their urine, which is also very likely. However, the amount of urine required for manufacturing medicines is absolutely large, and like the "Qiushi" manufacturing place I mentioned, it is far away in Taozhuang past Jiashan. If they cannot get boys' urine, they actually try to come to Shanghai, risking a similar violation of the law, to find it, which can be said to be at any cost!</p>
<p>However, regarding the efficacy of "Qiushi" itself, superstition is more than fact. Just imagine: Those urines may come from sick children. Those who make Qiushi do not know what the ingredients are in the urine and actually make medicine. Even if it is effective for certain diseases, this is still incredible today!</p>
<h3>Admonition</h3>
<p>— Zan Ying</p>
<p>People who don't have time to exercise will definitely have time to get sick; people who don't have time to relax their nerves will definitely have time to suffer from insomnia.</p>
<p>People who are good at enriching their lives are also the people who understand exercise the most and often relax their nerves.</p>
<h3>Weekend Tea Talk</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>In a Nutshell</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's selection of the top ten news stories has been announced. After reading the top ten news stories in Shanghai, we feel very sad. Except for the second, seventh, and eighth items, almost none of them are not related to the current turbulent economic situation; grain loans, gold bricks, hawkers, Jiang Gongmei, Yu Xiangnong, Rong Desheng, and even the Shanghai Miss scandal are all caused by the endless high prices. I don't remember which of these "cases" it was, but one of the main criminals in the case confessed: "Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it is better to take the risk." At this time and place, these two sentences can especially be used as the conclusion for these many major cases mentioned above. As the year comes to an end and the weather is cold, the cases are all coming to an end, but the price of gold and rice will not stop jumping because of the new year. If we do another selection a year later, can we be allowed not to see these painful events again?</p>
<p>Too Much of Anything Is a Bad Thing</p>
<p>According to reports, Duval, a graduate of Abeville University, closed his doors and lived in Switzerland eighteen years ago because he was tired of modern life, spending eighteen years in a small world without ever leaving his home. Some people say that this is truly a monster of the atomic age, but I think it is far from it. Because college students are too lively now. For decades, from dancing and dating "sand crabs," they have evolved to the point of almost exploring the North and South Poles. Since the times have overcorrected, of course too much of anything is a bad thing. Therefore, Duval is no different from speaking in person, locking himself up first, and locking himself up for eighteen years to show his determination to reverse the declining social trends. Shanghai has the advantage of being the first to catch the trend. Unemployed college students who are interested in writing a long masterpiece such as "History of the Republic of China" may as well be "Chinese Duvals." Even if "his hair and beard hang down to his knees, and his body is covered with maggots—he is still "not mentally ill and is more intelligent than ordinary people," you can rest assured; however, the problem is that "newspapers and food" must be prepared in advance.</p>
<p>The True Meaning of "Neurasthenia"</p>
<p>I went to listen to Peking Opera with a friend, and they were performing "Catching and Releasing Cao." Cao Cao on the stage had already killed his way from behind the curtain to outside the curtain with a sword, met Lu Boshe, and slashed him down with a sword. My friend, who is a doctor, suddenly said with a sense of feeling: "Cao Cao must be suffering from neurasthenia." But looking at Chen Gong's panicked, frustrated, and fully displayed kind expression on the stage, I felt that his neurasthenia was even more serious than Cao Cao's. For example, now, someone is eager to help others and borrows a sum of money to a friend who is having a hard time getting through the year, stating that they don't want "high interest." This is of course the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness; but later, this friend actually absconds with the money and goes to the ends of the earth, leaving no trace, and as a result, the public is harmed by their poor financial management and commits suicide to die for friendship. What is the difference between this and Lu Boshe's kindness being killed? But at this time, we must not "suffer from neurasthenia" like Chen Gong and blame the world and people's hearts. We must watch coldly; this ungrateful friend may one day have a way to deal with the money he absconded with, speculate successfully, and become a celebrity. You can put on a dignified face and say: "I knew you would have this day, that guy deserved to die!" Many social celebrities are a bit "neurasthenic." You should follow this principle of responding to all changes with the same. Chen Gong was finally killed by Cao Cao at Bai Men Lou for a simple reason: he didn't understand this at all, and his "neurasthenia" was more serious than ordinary people!</p>
