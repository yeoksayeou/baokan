<h3>東北停戰協議簽字　時效以本月廿二日為限　長春執行分部人選派定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕今為東北停戰令公布後第九日，距停戰限期祇有六日。昨日由馬使及政府代表與中共代表就蔣主席停戰令指示之第一項所擬訂之東北停戰具體辦法，其議定文件「係根據三月廿三日軍事三人委員會在重慶議訂東北停戰之三項協定」，經白魯德將軍於昨晚十一時携呈蔣主席審閱後，當於今午重由馬歇爾特使，政府代表徐永昌，中共代表周恩來逐一簽署後，此一協定遂宣吿完成。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕軍事調處執行部長春前進分部之組織及東北停戰之具體辦法，已於今日中午由軍事三人委員會馬歇爾·徐永昌·周恩來·政府代表為蔡守廉將軍，中共代表為饒漱石將軍。聞白魯德定十六日偕中共瀋陽中心小組副組長李敏然少將及廿七小組王首道少將飛長工作，聞李五二人曾於今晨九時半往訪馬使，并與白魯德有所商談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕聞軍調部東北執行小組現有四組，長春前進分部成立後，可能增有七組或八組，此項小組之政府代表，正由國防部遴選增派中。中共代表將由延安選派，大局確已於矛盾之狀態中，露出一綫曙光。今北平軍調部交通管理科長希爾上校，曾於上午十一時至梅園新村訪晤周恩來，交換恢復交通之意見，據中共自稱：謂已獲得接近之方案，又北平軍，調部交通管理科中共代表黃逸峯，亦於今日下午三時由平乘機來京。黃氏係奉周恩來召，來京參加交通談判，聞交長俞大維已根據主席指示曁歷次與馬使及周恩來，希爾上校等會談之結論，擬定恢復交通之整個方案，俟各方意見接近，即擬於日內舉行正式談判，作最後決定。如中共確有恢復交通誠意，不生意外，此項協定即可完成．</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十五日電〕今日馬歇爾將軍似可獲得良好機會，在十五日停戰期限終止前達到停戰，恢復交通及整編軍隊之協定，但大部份觀察家對長期解決一節，表示極端悲觀。此間可靠消息謂：馬歇爾·周恩來·俞大維進行長期會談之後，國共間在交通問題上刻已成立協議，</p>
<p>但離停戰期限終止日僅七日，甚多急要問題尚待解決。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕十五日京市新民晚刊載有東北停戰辦法雙方已簽字，并由蔣主席親自簽字新聞一則，中央社記者特訪問蔣主席之侍從秘書，承告：主席并無簽字於此項協議文件之事，據余（秘書自稱）所知，白魯德將軍前晚曾晉謁主席，提出添派東北執行小組，進行調處之協議問題，主席表示自共軍久佔四平街，長春等地後，三月廿七日協定已被其破壞無餘，不過主席鑒於美方調處之熱心，為求得和平之能早日促成起見，只要在六月廿二日能有詳細有效之停戰辦法，對此提議當亦不反對，但此協議時效只能以以本月廿二日為限云。并聞，關於此點，徐部長於簽訂協議時，亦曾特加聲明，故該報所述，與事實不符。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕根據美方提議，將來談判成功，軍調部將在東北至少派出八個小組，此等小組可能駐在哈爾濱·齊齊哈爾·海拉爾·海城。又聞馬歇爾·徐永昌·周恩來不久將往瀋陽。</p>
<p>〔上圖（中）馬歇爾，（右）徐永昌，（左）周恩來〕。</p>
<h3>松花江共軍活躍　乘停戰機會不斷施攻擊　國軍請執行部迅予制止</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十五日電〕共軍吉·熱·遼野戰軍區第七縱隊廿一旅之一部，十一日晨九時向國軍松花江北岸橋頭堡陣地攻擊，破壞障碍物二道，该地守备国军被迫抵抗，发生激战，至十二日丑時，共軍向東北敗退。但於當日天明，復以全力改由鐵道西側向國軍攻擊，均未得逞，自十三日晨向陶賴昭退去。昨日共軍又由舒蘭抵拉法北廿餘公里之馬鞍山約廿餘人，旋又竄經該地西南十餘公里之廣岑附近，趕築工事。又前　拉法之共軍第一師及第二師即廿二旅，仍盤據駮河一帶，共軍乘停戰機會，不守信義，向國軍攻擊，軍事當局已電請執行部迅予制止。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十五日電〕記者九日赴松花江前綫視察，并訪前方駐軍指揮官潘裕昆將軍，據潘氏稱：在停戰命令頒布前，國軍已進抵松花江北岸十七華里之陶賴昭及以西五十華里之五家站以東四十華里之五顆樹各地點。於七日晨九時接獲停戰命令後，即遵令停止追擊，不料於停戰命令生效後三小時之七日下午三時，即有共軍七八百人進犯五顆樹。同日九時，又以約千人之部隊進犯陶賴昭及五家站，八日并有共軍一隊，內有騎兵三百人，進攻哈拉哈，未逞而退。十日晚十一時又有携大砲入門，輕重機槍十餘挺之共軍，進攻距松花江八華里之小城子，當即被我守軍擊退。據十日所獲情報，共軍現有向王家子集結兵力，企圖渡江進犯之模樣。</p>
<h3>杜聿明返長春　行前視察小豐滿電廠</h3>
<p>〔中央社永吉十五日電〕杜長官聿明，梁兼主席華盛，廖司令官耀湘，十五日上午十時出席此間在北山廣場舉行之市民大會，到市民四萬餘人，下午一時杜長官等前往永吉西南廿五公里之小豐滿水力發電所視察，杜長官為嘉獎該所員工保護設備起見，特撥發流通券廿萬。下午四時由小豐滿抵永吉，即轉車站搭四時五十分專車返長。廖司令官等同行。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日電〕長春市民十三日上午十時在中山公園盛大舉行歡迎杜長官大會，到各界民眾五萬餘人，梁兼主席致簡短之開會詞後，杜氏即席致詞，首先說明蔣主席自九一八以來關懷東北同胞之至意，蔣主席前雖來長一行，但未能與眾多同胞見面，故此次特代表蔣主席來此慰問。繼說明國家統一建設之重要性，末對愛護外僑及「軍愛民，民助軍」方面有所闡述，嗣由市民代表逢長增致歡迎詞，對杜長官蒞長，表示熱烈歡迎，并對空軍第十地區俞司令恩心在長功績，加以讚譽感謝。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十五日電〕杜聿明長官今偕廖耀湘司令官，於下午八時半由永吉專車返此，杜長官可能於明日飛返瀋陽。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕交通界息：共軍正自津浦綫泊頭鎭起，向東經陳子口修築公路直通煙臺。又息，自張家口起越冀察邊境至冀中唐縣，共軍亦修一公路，并準備橫跨冀中平原修一公路，使之與山東相接，而銜通一自張家口起之長距離出口要道。</p>

<h3>保土衛民責無帝貸　中宣部發言人昨發表談話　政府盼十五日內解決一切</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕中宣部發言人，頃發表談話如下：政府切望在十五日期間，解決目前最切迫之問題，而共方則欲先談交通問題，再及整編統編軍隊問題，如此拖延，則此種迫切問題，將不能在規定期內獲得切實之解決，深盼共方注意一週以來共方廣泛發動攻擊，但共方卻宣傳係受政府軍隊之攻擊，而出於自衛，此種倒果為因之宣傳。試問共方如不攻擊，則德州，泰安，周村，膠縣，棗莊，韓莊等重要城鎭，何至為共方所佔領，如共方不能撤退此等在六月七日以後攻佔之城鎭，則其撕毀休戰協定，豈非顯然。有人問，政府何以遣派艦隊陸續赴青島，吾人可奉告，共軍近日圍攻青島附近各地，并歷次企圖登陸未逞，政府有保土衛民，維持治安之責任，自不能放任不顧也。</p>
<h3>津浦膠濟平漢等四路　交通正謀恢復中　瀋陽長春全段今日通車</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕據消息錄通者言，交部已着手恢復津浦，膠濟，平漢，隴海各路交通之準備，預期在一個半月以內，有修通津浦，膠濟兩路之可能。惟復路必先停戰，而停戰必須先行撤兵，就目前談判程序研究，一般關心交通問題之人士，均確認迅速確定共軍防區，以解決「停戰」「撤兵」兩大難題，實為恢復交通之先決大前提。據悉，馬使最近正以某超人之智慧，致力於此，不久即可提出討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十五日電〕中長鐵路瀋陽，長春間搶修工程，業經修竣，今自四平試駛長春情況良好，遂決於十六日晨七時半恢復瀋長全段通車。又該路瀋陽大石橋轉營口一段，亦經修復，於昨日起通車。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津十四日電〕東北停戰半月令下，於今八日，鐵路交通仍續遭共軍破壞，北寗路津榆段坨子頭車站十華里處之共軍四百餘人，十三日晨二時，向護路隊攻擊，四時許被擊退。津浦北段姚官屯興濟間，十三日晨二時為共軍所埋地雷炸毀軌七根，經路局派隊搶修，當日晨八時十五分修復。</p>
<h3>青島局勢轉緩和　政府派遣艦艇駛往戒備</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕來也洶洶，去也怱怱之青島濟南的緊張局勢，已因美柯克海軍上將來京請示馬歇爾特使之結果，及中共一再發表不擬進攻青濟之聲明而告緩和。據昨今由山東來京者稱，青島海面，確已風平浪靜，但濟南尚在重重包圍中。</p>

<p>〔合眾社南京十五日電〕宣傳部長彭學沛，今日發表政府對魯省嚴重局勢所取政策之聲明時謂：茲正派遣海軍艦艇前往共軍威脅下之青島，因政府不能坐視無覩。派遣艦艇，乃履行政府維持國內安定秩序之義務。彭氏并稱：茍共軍不自六月七日以來攻佔之城市撤退，〔則彼等顯已將停戰協定撕成粉粹。〕</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕海軍處駐滬專員辦公處，自國防部成立以後，進行改組，設立艦隊指揮部。指揮官由海軍總司令陳誠兼任，魏濟民任參謀長。刻因青島局勢緊張，共軍有自海面登陸企圖，指揮部方面除派長治，永德，咸寗等艦駛往戒備外，魏氏亦於日前赴青視察。</p>
<h3>陳毅發表聲明　當屬另有作用</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五電〕陳毅昨日發表一聲明，同時致電軍調部，謂歡迎政府派員赴臨泝商談，解決山東問題，政府方面負責人今稱，陳毅此舉乃一陰謀，其用意在於造成事實後而期以優勢地位，謀得妥協，故商談亦可，然共軍須先撤出其近所攻佔之城市，否則勿議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社青島十五日電〕中共新四軍長陳毅今日要求政府勿利用青島運送國軍至東北，并保證將不進攻青島。陳氏星期三曾在其戰地司令部與美軍官舉行會談，當時堅決否認其所部有攻擊青島之意，并宣稱：共軍在青島附近各鎭活動，係為對付偽軍。陳氏曾分函美第七艦隊司令柯克及青島美軍司令克萊門，內稱：對外傳國軍第四及第五十三軍即將由上海開赴青島轉往東北一節。甚表關切，擬請美軍代為加以阻止。共軍進攻青島之說，今日已漸平息。中共代表郝鼎偕柯克代表拉遜曾乘小型偵察機由青島飛往臨沂，與陳毅會晤，經七小時會談後，已遄返青島。陳毅當提出三項建議即：（一）國軍保證不使用青島，（二）調執行小組來青，以便處理附近一帶之小規模衝突，（三）歡迎美方技術人員及資本開發山東佔領區內之各煤礦。郝氏已於今晨離青赴南京，將建議各點報告周恩來，或再由周氏轉告馬歇爾特使。</p>
<h3>青中美軍聯防　美稱并無其事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據上間美海軍當局昨告記者稱：共軍對於青島美海軍陸戰隊，至今一無影響，青島海軍動態一切如常。外傳形勢嚴重，實係謬誤。關於中央軍隊與美海軍聯防事，亦稱并無其事。又悉：美第七艦隊司令柯克上將將偕其屬員，於本月內移駐青島，但確實行期，尚未決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美駐華海軍總司令柯克上將，昨語中央社記者稱：關於中共軍隊襲擊青島之舉動，美駐青島之海軍及海軍陸戰隊，所採取之對策，未便明告，但美軍自有政策。記者復詢以美海軍在青島之實力時，柯克將軍稱：實力以隨時適應環境而增減。</p>

<h3>社論　嚴懲貪官米蠧</h3>
<p>糧貸舞弊案，現已成爲萬目睽睽所注意的大案了！並不是因爲這案件貪汚數字之大，老實說十億元由今天的幣値來看，也算不得一筆怎樣的鉅款，以五千倍物價來計，不過二十萬元，就算全數吞沒了，在戰前似乎還挨不着大貪汚案裏去。今天糧貸案之所以爲朝野上下一致注意者，有三大原因：（一）米價已漲得駭人，政府爲抑平米價纔辦糧貸，而還竟有貪官米蠧從中舞弊肥己，這眞是喪心病狂。（二）取締囤積，制裁投機，早爲社會公論，亦爲政府決策，却還有人從「民食」想利用低利的公　，做他囤積投機的發財夢，如何不爲萬人唾駡？（三）嚴懲貪官汚吏，國民政府固不止三令五申，而勝利以來，道路流傳，貪污成　，現在發覺了這一件不　抵賴的鉅案，人家　有政府拿出什麽辦法來表示共肅淸貪污的決心。</p>
<p>好了！現在有希望了！這件大案初發生的時候，我們就知道中樞當局特派大員來滬密査，後來又經江蘇監察使程中行氏正式糾舉，公布調査實况，法院且已定期明大開庭偵訊。而據中央社消息，該案主角在達人前晚已被嚴密監視，警備司令部又奉最高當局手令，對本案嚴加査辦。就案論案，我們相信偵訊推鞫的結果，一定可以水落石出，無論貪官奸蠧，當不致倖逃法網。</p>
<p>惟糧貸舞弊案，我們所以特別痛心疾首者，誠如程監察使所謂「直接貽害民生，間接毁墮政府威信，」絕不能與尋常貪汚案相提並論。據監察使署在報端發表糾舉書所列舉之事實，綜合有下列各項：（一）申請糧貸之商號，沒無限制，官商勾結，互相作弊，且大半由糧政處預先接洽佈置。（二）「糧商」旣獲得貸款，有的並不立即前往產區購糧，轉以高利貸出，坐享其成，有的則購糧之後，並不立即拋售，企圖囤積居奇，有的將售糧所得款項，移作他用，而糧政處對此種種未能盡其監督考核之責任。（三）四月下旬米價飛漲，糧政處藉口市塲糾紛，竟令糧貸米停止出售，達十日之久，致使米價狂漲不已。（四）糧政處巧立名目，微收「審査費」，而糧食部核定之貸款辦法並無此項規定。（五）當貸款核定之際，輿論攻擊甚烈，但糧政處置若罔聞，「彼等何所恃而無恐，其幕後主持又爲何人？」</p>
<p>從上面所舉五點而言，糧貸舞弊案之所以應受查辦，完全由於「舞弊」而並非由於「糧貸」。近來忽有一種論調，竟說糧貸案錯在政策，不是錯在技術，其意無非要說「不應該有糧貸」，好像沒有糧貸也就沒有舞弊了，一切罪過都應由批准糧貸政策者負之，這眞是「語妙天下」了！爲了上海米價貴，大家說存米少，利息高，成本昂，於是紛紛請求低利糧貸。當時何嘗有人反對？而且政府如果不准貸款，米價如果續漲，大家又會哄起來責備政府。然則政府撥款辦糧貸，究竟有什麼錯！平心而論，「糧貸」無罪，而辦理糧貸「舞弊」者確實有罪。故今天政府的査辦，就是要査辦這些辦糧貸而有舞弊「技術」者之罪。糧貸案如果有錯，就錯在這舞弊的「技術」！</p>
<p>其次，此案中的米蠧，外傳大小不一，而且有商雜糅。「狐狸豺狼，同受顯戳」，固然大快人心，但爲整肅綱紀起見，與其戮狐狸，不如戮豺狼，與其辦奸商，不如辦貪官！因爲戮狐狸放掉了豺狼，辦奸商開脫了貪官，這種辦法，依然是走「官官相護」的老路，結果則「竊國者侯，竊鈎者誅」，非但不足以懲一儆百，或且更引起輿論的不平。我們敢再說一句老實話，假使沒有貪官，則奸商縱使要「奸」，亦將無從售其「奸計」。古人早已說過：「國家之敗，由官邪也；官之失德，寵賂章也。」程監察使也說：「欲謀剷除奸商，必先消滅貪官汚吏」，這是顚撲不破的名言。而且我們以爲要辦貪官，更須先辦主持舞弊的大貪官。程監察使對於這一層，也知之甚諗。所可惜的，就是在其糾舉書中，僅謂「其幕後主持者，又爲何人？」雖似呼之欲出，但究屬吞吐其詞。國人對於監察院的糾舉貧汚，向來認爲只能「拍蒼蠅」，而對於高官顯要，反多噤若寒蟬。但是每件營私舞弊的案情，差不多均有幕後主持者，結果往往讓那「一官半職」的小官吏倒霉，而高官顯要依然逍遙法外。所以言官要不怕威勢，不避風險，儘量提出糾舉，尤其是對於這些幕後人。惟有對於舞弊權要嚴加懲處，始眞能懲一儆百。即以此案而論，不要說幕後主持人了，就是被糾舉的糧政處特派員楊錫志，早在國外逍遙，而且糧食裁撤糧政處改設儲運處，仍須派楊錫志·在達人爲正副處長，還有什麼可說！</p>

<h3>四國外長巴黎復會　美蘇態度依然堅決　和約問題仍將為爭執焦點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十五日廣播：在婁分鐘前（上海時間十六日上午一時），四強外長會議重行舉行，英外相貝文首先到會，莫洛托夫姍姍來遲，當即開會討論議程，會議正在進行中。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：蘇聯代表莫洛托夫與英外相貝文，在盧森堡客之囂廳，曾互相握手，表示親善，可見四國外長前途尚有妥協之望。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十四日電〕美·英·蘇三國外長今日先後齊集此間。其時美方付出消息稩，美蘇對於和約之爭執，態度堅決，與月前上次會議時情形不相上下。美國務卿貝爾納斯乘杜魯門總統私人飛機最先到此，未幾，英外相貝文及蘇外長莫洛托夫（外次維辛斯基，第加諾索夫二人同來）亦相繼接踵而至。據貝爾納斯左右宣稱：自五月間會議休止至今，美蘇政府并未在外交上交換意見，蘇聯態度如已和綏，則能在會議席上知之。貝爾納斯今晚在此招待記者後，一般印象以為貝氏仍樂觀，惟蘇聯與西方各國對於義大利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，匈牙利及荷蘭各國和約重大爭執，是否能成立相當協議，并無事實上之根據。美方仍堅持特里埃斯特應歸義大利，巴爾幹各國應開放與西方各國通商。義大利賠款應以其力能償付者為限，美國仍欲與蘇英法簽訂二十五年互助條約共同監視解除德國軍備。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕貝文於赴法前在機場微笑而言曰：余對外長會議始終抱有希望，上帝為各事之主宰，希望上帝此次能較仁慈。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十四日電〕貝爾納斯本日抵巴黎後談稱：此次重來，深為愉快。康納萊亦向各報記者稱：渠非常樂觀，美國代表團當即開始工作，給人一種印象，即不遺餘力是也。以實際情形而論，此次外長會議，氣氛遽較上次為順利。美代表團所乘杜魯門總統之專機〔聖牛〕號，已飛返美國。</p>
<h3>世界之分合　全繫於此會</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處舊金山十四日電〕外長會議開幕前，美各報均紛紛發表社論，加以論列。紐約時報昨日強調巴黎和平談話之重要，略稱：略稱：「在戰爭期內及動盪不定之和平第一年內，各國外長與元首之會議，已舉行多次，每次皆屬重要性質，但無一次有如未來巴黎會議之重要者，巴黎會議，將確定戰爭之結果，是否將為一個世界或兩個世界。」該報社論作家述及國務卿貝爾納斯分化德國行政之計劃稱：「六月十五日行將重啟之會議，又有恢復盟國戰時合作政策之希望，不然，各大國之關係將愈趨惡化，而有加速世界裂分為二之趨勢。」</p>
<h3>波茨坦協定　命運可分曉</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十四日電〕外長會議重開時，波茨坦協定命運如何可見分曉。據國際方面人士談稱，英美兩國代表團均認為波茨坦協定內若干事項，凡由彼等認為主要之點者，如若不能付諸實施，則整個協定即當認為喪失效力，果爾，則美英蘇三強關於德國東陲所成立之決定，亦不復加以尊重矣。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林十四日電〕英軍佔領區軍事副長官羅勃森少將宣稱：英決定立即接管區內私人所有面積在五百頃以上之農田，此乃軍政府在接獲并審查土地改革報告書以前之過渡辦法，該項報告書正由顧問委員會擬具中。</p>
<p>又據羅氏談稱：德國英佔領區今已開放，可由盟國記者出入調查，但對俄人之便利，則亦以蘇軍佔領區所許可之範圍為限。</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾福十四日電〕據悉：盟國管制委會英方委員總部，將遷至漢堡。預料須至明年秋季始可遷畢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十五日廣播：已罷工之美國海員，現仍未復工，彼等不滿政府與工會所成立之協議，要求予以修改。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕全國海員及碼頭工人廿七萬五千名，原定今日夜半罷工，美海軍已準備接收航輪，免致運輪停頓。但至預定罷工時刻前三句半鐘，勞資雙方經政府調解，卒於下午八時廿八分簽訂協定，解決工資及服務時間問題，絕大風波已因此避免。此次工潮，牽涉五個工會，若果實行，則有美輪三千一百艘停駛，將為美國戰後之重大打擊，全世界均將受其影響。</p>

<h3>聯合國原子能委會會議　美代表提議　設國際機構　戰爭中禁用原子炸彈　決定適當制度管制之</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十四日電〕聯合國機構原子能委員會今日會議歷時甚短，決定組織事宜，會議主席按照慣例，以英文字母為序，由會員國流值。因此，於美代表巴　樞担任臨時主席後，第一月主席由澳外長伊瓦特担任。委員會旋宣告休會至六月十九日再開，各國代表即將美提案全文電告本國政府。</p>
<p>美代表今日宣讀杜魯門總統致委員會電，略稱：「請寄語各國代表，余深感各國代表所從事之工作，意義重大，世無其匹，此事之成敗在關全世界之命運，茲特代表全體美國人遙祝一帆風順」。</p>
<p>今日會議時，巴魯摳演說之警句云：「世界和平或世界毀滅，唯本委員會是擇」。</p>
<p>〔又電〕原子能委會今日舉行首次會議美代表巴魯樞提議設立國際原子能發展機構，如有適當管理制度，病因願銷毀所有原子炸彈并停止製造。此項提議在巴黎四國外長再度會議聲中影響甚大。巴氏提案成為聯合國機構中特殊文件之一，聲明美國將堅持在此項發展及和平應用原子能機構中，任何部份不得有否決權。</p>
<p>提案內容</p>
<p>美國提案主張於戰爭中禁用原子彈，世界及全機構不應僅持虔誠之思想，而須有可以實行之制裁與「有齒」之國際公法為其後盾。懲戒破壞國際信仰應為今日安全制度之核心，如能議定管理原子能之適當制度，付諸實施，美國願作下列建議：（一）停止製造原子炸彈；（二）現有之原子炸彈，按照條約規定處置；（三）國際原子機構應獲有原子能生產之詳細報告。</p>
<p>國際原子機構當從原料入手，採取下列辦法：（一）各種原子能活動對於世界安全具有危險性者，應歸國際機構經管保有；（二）對於其他一切原子能活動，國際機構有機管理，檢查及發給執照；（三）國際機構有扶助以原子能供有益用途之義務；（四）國際機構有研究與發展原子能之積極責任，使其在原子學識方面處於先進地位，因而能明瞭及偵知原子能之妄用與否。各國對於下列破壞國際管理機構之事，應擬訂最嚴厲罰則：（一）私藏或使用原子炸彈；（二）私藏或運用適於製造原子炸彈之原料；（三）攫取屬於國際機構或已領執照之任何工廠或財產；（四）任意干涉國際機構之活動；（五）違背或反抗國際管理機構核準之執照，創設或運用危險性計劃。（以下美新聞處電）</p>
<p>基本要點</p>
<p>巴氏并提出下列辦法，以代表一整個計劃的各項基本要點。（一）管理機構應擬定管制原子能之全盤計劃；（二）管理機構最先之目的應為獲取并保持關於世界鈾和　的供應的完備而準確的情報，并從而加以控制；（三）管理機構應實施全部管制分裂性原料的生產；（四）管理機構對於原子爆炸物範圍內的研究，應賦有唯一絕對指導之義；（五）因本實上對於安全含有危險而完全交託給管理機構的一切活動，應分佈於全世界，同時原料和分裂性材料不應集中於一處；（六）管理機構一部份之工作為促進原子能平時的利益；（七）應規定不斷檢討問題，修正危險和非危險活動的分綫；（八）凡經營鈾和　的工廠，均由管理機構管制；（九）一切本質上危險的活動，完全委託管理機構辦理，藉以減少稽查的困難；（十）管理機構一切合格的代表必須有出入的保障；（十一）管理機構人員應量才錄用，并在可能範圍內不分國藉；（十二）管理機構之憲章一經通過後，即須次第實行；（十三）在聯合國原子能委員會之審議中，美國準備供給必在之情報；（十四）　粹國立之原子能發展管理機構，應附屬於國際原子能管制之下，委員會對於此種國立之管理機構，應明白劃分職權和責任的範圍。</p>
<p>蘇無意見</p>
<p>〔聯會社紐約十四日電〕蘇代表葛羅米柯宣稱：「原子能委會之情形尚稱順利。巴魯樞之演說，寫作與發表均佳，余對其內容無意見發表。」英代表賈德幹亦謂：「巴氏演說甚佳，可謂恰到好處。」澳代表伊瓦特稱：委員會下星期三會議卻，各國將絡續提出覆文。原子能委會係安全理事會全體理事組成，除美，英，法，蘇，中，波，澳，荷，埃及，巴西及墨西哥十一國外，另加加拿大一國。加拿大雖不屬安全理事會，惟以其於原子彈發展上會與美英兩國積極參加，故給以原子能委會常任委員一席。</p>

<h3>四國外長的經歷與傷風</h3>
<p>— 本報特輯</p>
<p>英、美、蘇、法四國外長會議，昨日起在巴黎重行開會了，據說這次會議，對於第二次大戰結束後的世界分合問題，必將有一個確定的答覆。會議的重要，於此可見。</p>
<p>值茲會議開幕之初，謹將四國外長的經歷與傷風，介紹給讀者，也許對於會議發展的了解，有些帮助。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯</p>
<p>美國國務卿貝爾納斯，先後任過兩院議員，最高法院陪審官與戰時動員復原局局長等職，但担任外交職位當屬生平第一次，一九四五年八月他曾陪同杜魯門總統出席波茨坦會議，同年十月出席第一次外長會議，當時曾以「和事老」出名。</p>
<p>貝氏生於南加洛林納州，出身貧困，以後的經歷使他言詞得圓滑，溫順而非常機巧，他在國會裏懂得了重大的法案非經過折中妥協無法通過。所以他的會議就是力能使陷於僵持立場的派別互相接近，相互讓步，而終於從爭論中獲得協議。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯以為他在國際談判中，他的經驗照樣可以應用，他相信一旦各國首要聚首一堂，只要經過禮讓往來的妥協，問題的癥結也一定可以解除無疑。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫</p>
<p>莫洛托夫是一位具有豐富經驗外交官。他心機靈快，態度從容，而且機富於自信。當他沉默時看來似乎是一位沒有主見的人，但當他發言時，就充分顯示他對於這冷酷地現實的世界了解得很清楚，他也許是史達林最老而最接近的同僚，他們倆一同由革命運動中崛起，兩人都是「老布爾塞維克」。莫洛托夫的執行史達林路綫也是最認眞的一人。</p>
<p>貝文</p>
<p>貝文以前也少外交經驗，這一點與貝爾納斯相像。他身軀肥碩，重達二百四十磅，他的到達今天的地位，完全由於從事職工會運動，他在工會裏多年的奮門，使他崛昇為若干重要工會的領袖，他以頑強與不妥協出名。生平沒有受過正式的敎育，但由於艱苦自習，深通了經濟與歷史。戰爭期間他是邱吉爾內閣勞工部長，英國人力動員的總司令。去年大選結果使艾德禮出任首相，他急於要找一位合適人員陪他去波茨坦出席官頭會議，結果他選了貝文，在英國歷史上外相的出身從沒有一個像貝文一樣是工人出身的人。</p>
<p>貝文除了上述各項特點以外，還有他那暴燥的脾氣與辛辣的　罵口吻。倫敦外長會議與最近安全理事會議時，他先後與莫洛托夫和維辛斯基兩人爭吵得面紅耳赤。</p>
<p>皮杜爾</p>
<p>皮杜爾是一位新官，法國光復後才担任外交部長，他以前是一位巴黎大學的歷史敎授與新聞記者，在法國淪陷期間領導秘密抗敵組織有功。今年四十六歲，比上述三人都年輕，他的外交經驗也并不豐富，出席過的重要國際會議是舊金山會議，倫敦外長會議及第一次巴黎外長會議。現在他是進步天主敎黨的領袖。</p>
<h3>東印軍繼續抗戰　英荷發最後警告　貝卡錫前綫砲戰進行中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：英荷當局今向印度尼西亞軍發出最後警告：謂東印軍陰若繼續軍事行動，則英方將出動大批飛機，實施轟炸。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴過維亞十四日電〕此間盟軍總部宣布，爪哇各線及蘇門答臘之棉蘭一帶，連帶活動近來較前增加，同時政治空氣似亦逐漸緊張。印尼人士指盟軍在吧城四週逐漸擴大防線，為企圖再事進攻之表示。近日傳稱印尼人已在泗水一帶集中，荷軍將接防吧城，印尼軍隊準備反攻　　，此等傳說殊難令人提摸，惟貝卡錫方面之迫擊砲及大砲聲，此間確清晰可聞。</p>

<h3>美國政策保持不變　決援助猶太移民　派遣官員赴英備諮詢</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統本日在招待記者會中稱：美國仍竭力主張容許十萬猶太人進入巴勒斯坦。總統又稱，美國不擬改變移民律，使更多猶太人由歐洲進入美國。總統對貝文聲明不欲置評，因據稱關於此事，迄未接獲英方正式通知。同時又據國務院稱，國務院官員二人偕陸軍官二人，昨已首途赴倫敦，以備駐英大使哈里曼與英國討論巴力斯坦局勢時，供其諮詢。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕英政府為與美進行會談，已自有關各部遴選官員，組成一代表團，由白洛克主持其事，會商因調查委員會建議所引起之各項事項。英政府將待會談獲有結果後，再定決策。</p>
<p>兩萬猶童移殖計劃</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷十四日電〕青年移民會已擬就續使歐洲猶太兒童二萬名，移入巴力斯坦之計劃，估計建築收容所等費用，需美金一千萬元，每年之收容費，需一千一百萬元。</p>

<h3>市政措施　與論界發表意見　市長談米糧　民食可無虞　黃色刊物決予取締</h3>
<p>吳市長國楨，昨日下午三時在市府會議室，舉行第二次招待新聞辦座談會，報吿市政設施，並聆取與論界意見，觀察家各報社負責人四十餘人，首由吳市長報吿兩點：（一）關於糧食問題，經市府力謀疏通來源，調查存糧後，米價已漸趨穩定，如在新穀登塲以前，向國外採購之米，能源源輸入，則本市民食問題，可吿無虞，此點希望各友邦侭量予以協助。（二）市府對於一般誨淫誨盜，妨害風化之黃色刊物，決予取締，因彼等現未依法申請登記，市府自有權禁止其出版發行，報吿畢，並提出：（一）房荒問題，（二）交通秩序問題，（三）攤販問題，（四）經濟危機問題，請與會人員發表意見，茲略述各人意見如次：</p>
<p>糧食問題</p>
<p>商報祝百英主張：（一）政府對糧食運銷，勿統制過嚴，以免影響市塲以外的米糧入口。（二）請政府與各友邦交涉，便利我國糧商向產糧家採購食糧。</p>
<p>房荒問題</p>
<p>大公報王蕓生，中華時報周　沖，僑聲報朱培基，商報祝百英，大公報李子寬，新聞報程滄波，華美晚報張志韓，先後發言，各人意見，歸納如下，（一）接收房屋的分配，應力求合理，公平與迅速。（二）修正建築條例，使得並鼓勵地主及有次力市民建造房屋，（三）保障業主產權，嚴禁二房東，三房客，高價轉頂，（四）調查報端所載房屋之機關名稱。（五）調查報端所載房屋如頂廣吿，取締索取金條頂屋之惡習，程滄波特別提出，敵偽產業處理局數月來，對於接收房屋始終未予公平合理分配與處理，且亦未作公開報吿，請市長於下次招待新聞界時，邀請該局劉局長攻蕓，出席報吿處理接收房屋的經過情形，會塲一致鼓掌，表示贊同。</p>
<p>黃色刊物</p>
<p>王蕓生，祝百英發表意見，歸納為：（一）注意大型報之黃色文字，（二）報紙刊物如有妨害　人名譽之記載，應鼓勵被害人依法提出控訴。（三）各報紙副刊，似不妨略將水準降低，俾適應一般讀者需要，但以不流為「黃色化」為度。</p>
<p>交通秩序　王蕓生，周韓等，分別提出下列意見：（一）能　要道日間限制大卡車行駛，（二）屬行電車及公共汽車站排除等辦法，（三）計劃開關地道交通，（四）指定空車停駐地點，禁止路旁隨地停車。</p>
<p>經濟危機</p>
<p>王蕓生主張：（一）捐稅負担力求公允，有錢人應多出錢。（二）厲行簡化稽征手續。（四）減少行政費，祝百英認為目前經濟上最大之危機，為對外貿易入超過　，其主要原因在於政府及一般人士過分重視匯率的高低，而忽視整個匯兌政策的運用，實則匯率過低，固屬有利於進口，不得於出口，而足妨害本國工業的生存與發展，匯率過高，亦未必於工業有利，蓋滙率過高，必將刺激物價與工資的狂漲，並使必需輸入之外國原料及生產工具的價格提高，各工廠由於生產成本，大為增加，出品仍不能與廉價外貨競爭，如政府能靈活運用滙兌政策，便利必需品的輸入，而禁止非必需品的進口，則滙率略低，即不致發生外貨傾銷的弊端，希望吳市長建議中央，酌予採納。</p>
<h3>市長再作報吿　提倡信用糙米</h3>
<p>吳市長於聆取各人發表一，再就上述各問題，略作的吿：關於糧食問題，擬提倡市民信用糙米，謂經專家研究，糙米所保有之維他命B，遠較精米為多，全國人民媽能均食糙米，不僅可增加糧食數量百分之十，且於人民之健康，亦屬有益，現已令本市豆米業公會及各製米廠，照規定之標準碾米，並電請中央，通令全國一律旅行。關於房屋之分配，決照完全公開與澈底清查，兩項原則辦理，本市一部份德僑將於本月底返國，所遺房屋，亦將予以合理分配。吳市長並報吿，行政院房屋分配委員會，原由行政院長駐滬辦事處，副主任黃伯樵氏兼任副主任委員，嗣以行政　辦事處撤銷，　氏乃請辭去房屋分理委會副主委職務，本人就任後，以黆工對上海情形極為熟悉，仍請渠繼續擔任房屋分配委會副主委，憶承渠允諾，報吿畢，座談會即於極度融洽之空氣中散會。</p>

<p>「我們現在的工作，衡諸我們的設備和能力，可以說是在用牛刀殺小雞！」</p>
<p>海軍部江南造船所人事室歐德主任苦笑着對記者說。</p>
<p>工業界普遍的遭遇到破產危機的今日，造船工業同樣地在近於窒息而苦悶的情形下艱苦維持着。江南造船所是全國唯一的造船工業，它的前身是南鐵廠，去年八九月間才從敵偽手裏接收過來，機器與設備總算沒有受到破壞，除了一小部份需要修理以外，其餘的雖然陳舊，也還大致可用。所長馬德驥是造船工程界的耆宿，遠在民國卅三年，馬先生組織了一個「造船服務團」，率領着二十幾們靑年技術人員，遠涉重洋，在美國各大造船廠裏服務，一方面代表政府參加聯合國的工作，一方面使他的幹部學習些實際的造船經騐。這一個服務團予美國人士以極良好的印象，尤其馬先生與勝利，江南造船所由他負責以後，就積極的向美國方面接洽新的機器與材料，預備大大地發展一下中國的造船工業。</p>
<p>「但是」，歐君慨吧地說：「材料，設備，人才，都有辦法，所苦的就是沒有主顧上門，造船不像其他的工業，可以先出了貨再等人來買。我們有充裕的力量建造一萬噸二萬噸甚至三萬噸的大船，但是誰肯來問津？商人不用說，連政府也祇曉得向外國買現成的」！為什麼原因呢；因為在外國買比在本國造便宜得多，外國船進口不用繳稅，而用來自建已造的機器和材料，政府卻並不予以免稅的優待，再加上昂貴的運費，以及在商物價影響下的工資和管理費用，當然是直接向外國買船來得合算了。</p>
<p>歐君繼續吿訴記者，該所現在的工作僅止於修理方面，雖然最近行總在該所定造了些運貨的小木船，但根本不上工程價値。現在共有工人二千餘名，員司兩百多人，大部份都是技術人員。</p>
<p>「我們必須維持這批技術人員，雖然現在的待遇非常清苦，我相信總有一天會用到他們」。歐堅定地說。</p>
<p>記者要求看看他們的船塢和工塲。他就請了一位也曾參加「造船服務團」去美而返國不久的雲惟賢工程師來作領導。</p>
<p>建造小木船　殺雞用牛刀　三處船塢中都歇着在修理中的船舶，第一號裏一艘大約幾千噸的已經快完竣了，新上的油漆發着亮光。第二號裏是一艘很小的內河船。第三號船塢最大，一艘塗着一片片黃色防銹油漆的巨輪停在那裏，十幾個工人在分頭工作，船名“Onward”大約有一萬多噸，是總統綫的船，雲君說：很令人不解的是我們自己政府機關的船舶，有時壞了反而不到這裏來修理。</p>
<p>船塢過去是建造塲，高　的鋼架似乎有些發銹，一根紅色的龍骨靜靜地躺在那裏，四週堆滿着建造行總小木船用的材料，有幾只小船已經在油漆了，另外有一批美國的登陸艇在改裝貨船。看到這樣的情形，「殺雞用牛刀」的比喻不覺又浮上記者腦際。牛刀牛刀，什麼時候才找得到你的牛呢？（文中）</p>
<h3>敵偽轄下團體職員　漢奸罪嫌解釋　須視有無犯罪事實</h3>

<h3>小池課程研究座（六）</h3>
<p>科目多不一定害死兒童　戕害兒童身心的是考試</p>
<p>活活潑潑，聰聰敏敏的小孩，上了三年學，不幸就得　肺病死了，某家長歸罪於小學課程的繁重，由科目的太多，舉事實說來，似乎是不錯的，其實即使假定各科目是戕害兒童的毒藥，多分幾小包，分別吃下，（即將各科分立），比併成幾大包，囫圖呑下（即將關係科目合併），或計倒囫於補救些龍。所以筆者認為修訂小學課程，不必在科目的分合上計算多少，課程表上科目列得具體些，在兒童和敎師方面，課前準備，也能够明白容易些。所以筆者主張，小學各科不妨分立！科目多，不一定害死兒童。其能戕害兒童身心的是考試！因爲小學裏面，有學月測騐，有學期考試，有臨時測騐，有畢業考試，多數敎師，不以此爲自我檢討敎材敎法適合一般兒童與否的張本，而專以用爲强迫兒童強行學習的手段，故意使兒童的精神情緒，非常緊張！具有好勝心的兒童，弄得食不安，睡不寗，時刻在及格不及格的恐怖中，頭昏腦脹，身心兩傷。修訂小學課程標準的專家們，不知可能同意減少學月測騐的提議，而使幼弱的兒童身心，不受極度的刺激，過分的緊張，而得自然發展，自然生長！（錢達三，卅五，六，十三，於鎭江）。</p>

<h3>社會局嚴格限制　米號售貨利潤　不得超過售價六％　米號存米均須登記</h3>
<p>本市各米號購進糧食，售與市民，所取利潤，向無標準，以致零售米價參差不一，且發售時大都不開發票，易滋流弊，現本市社會局特令飭米號商同業公會糾正，茲照録訓令如下，「查本市米號購進米種，於門市發售時，與進價相距甚遠，若不予以糾正，影響民食，殊非　鮮，茲經酌定，自令到日起，凡各米號門市售價不得超過購進價格總數之百分之六，發售時須開具發票，并將購買人姓名地址分別別登記入冊以備核查，合行令仰該會迅即轉飭該所屬各米號一體遵照　遠」。</p>
<p>又悉最近一部份米號，竟將所有存米　以雜質出售，冀獲更豐厚利潤，並藉口存貨不多，並不易在市場購得，故紛紛申請照市　配，但此等米號經公會查實，尚存足數門市需要之存糧，殊有非法囤積拒售情事，現米號業公會為防杜囤積，普遍流通米糧起見，對米號存糧辦理登記，凡米號存糧確係稀少，為在市場確未能購得者，該會即　請米市場照市撥配。至於已經審查合格可以請求配米之米號，除十三日核定之三十三家外，十四日又追加一百四十五家，昨又有百餘家云。</p>
<p>昨日米市仍然原盤做開，麵粉胃呆，厰盤彷彿，麩皮貨主求脫，新麩將見，人心不振，回小一二百元，豆餅挫二三百元，黃豆跌五六百元至千元，小麥站定，蠶豆各路來貨頗旺，市勢供過於求，形趨疲乏，油價亦乏軒輊，米市場昨日客貨登記稍見增加，總達三二二一石，內白粳五三四石，薄稻四三三石，早稻三八石，羊秞五七〇石，杜秞三七九石，蕪秞六一七石，白元七石，碾秞七〇三石·</p>
<h3>金價小挫</h3>
<p>烚赤昨略轉平，報載時局尚有希望，浮多脫手，開後一度微升至一九三萬，不久即被壓小，美鈔轉鬆，會間跌至一八九萬，始有雜持，十時後中央配給一八二條，價一九〇萬，此後形勢穩定，始終在一九一萬左右徘徊，午後美鈔大跌，金價亦被帶小，惟因週六關係，不易售齣，照賣價比較，下跌四萬五，飾金念萬，紋銀二千二，銀元一三八〇元有賣，暗拆平定，息價未更。</p>
<h3>大戶出籠　公債步跌</h3>
<p>公債昨七樓有大戶兩家出籠，最開後自四九〇〇元步跌至四五〇〇元，始由五樓某北帮稍加吸收，微升至四六〇〇元結束，結果較前收下趺四五〇元，丁種則因價賤有人套買，僅跌一百元，甲乙亦跌三百五，戊種跌四百元</p>
<h3>人造絲續漲　綢貨又見轉機</h3>
<p>人造絲昨又繼續高漲，一二〇號天橋有光現貨，開盤一百五十八萬元，最大喊六十三萬元，旋又回做五十七八萬元收盤，下午做五十六萬元，結果比上日大四萬元，一二〇號美女上午做一百五十萬元，下午做四十三萬元，旭暉上午做一百四十五萬一萬元，下午做四十萬元，半光貨稀求頗殷，價獨好，竟大起七八萬元，七五號金難半元，價與上日相仿，疲落二日之綢貨，昨又轉機，美亞被面，每百條做一百五十八萬元，大誠格子　綯每碼即期五千七百元，隔日期做七百三十元，較上日大四百五十元，厰絲市況平穩，用戶絲上級二十分二十二成交價二百十五萬至二百二十二萬元，干經洋行貨昨有十包做開，價一百八十萬元，用戶干經無交易，喊價未動。</p>
<h3>絲織裝飾品　美國企求甚殷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國戰後，房屋分配亦甚欠勻，故人民於住屋之面積，絕不過奢務求切合於實用為主，其室內家俱之佈置，亦採取小巧玲瓏者，因是　面上之裝飾品，亦以小型尺寸蠶絲織品　布為其需求標的，裹以戰前我國絲織品暢銷於美國市場，夙負盛舉，故於吾華貨之企求，甚為殷切。</p>
<h3>夏布當令　來貨稀少市價甚昂</h3>
<p>江西夏布，以萬載宜黃，上皋等數縣出品較豐，質亦精良。滬市對夏布一項，在衣用及蚊帳方面，銷路順廣，惟以交通欠暢，並無大批運滬，現僅恃跑單帮者運售，以致數量不多，且均係作快件裝運，旅運各費至鉅，致價格甚昂，日前曾有上皋夏布百餘件抵滬，瞬息間即爭購一空，現又無貨應市。據業中人談，如能大量裝運來滬，則運費較低，價可稍趨平穩云。</p>
<h3>外幣不得結匯　美鈔一瀉千里</h3>
<p>中央銀行於昨日特發通告，於各指定經營外匯銀行，自即日起，關於一切禁止進口物品及中央銀行第四十二號通告所列之物品，暨其他未經核准之申請書，其所需外匯，指定銀行不得收受外幣鈔券，結售外匯。</p>
<p>又關於本市二百五十家領有甲種經營外匯各行號所經營之外幣買賣，亦經規定，每週具報中央銀行外匯審核處，如發現有超越範圍現象，當吊銷其准許經營憑　，至於外幣出口，每人仍以二百元為限，超過規定須由財政部特許，否則一經海關查出，當地人依法處置。</p>
<p>美鈔最開二七三〇元光景，即遭賣氣所包圍，不久即步跌至二六七〇元，始有支援，惟過程平庸，交易不甚活動，直至午刻仍站二七〇〇元光景，濟勢仍感不支，午後値週六，賣戶因傳聞洋行禁收美鈔之訊，削價求售，缺乏雜持，交易雖少，喊價下降甚鉅，買價又喊至二千四百元，港票亦回小五元，印匯五六〇元，港匯四五五元，均少成交。</p>
<h3>柏油突飛猛晋</h3>
<p>柏油自前週起，銷塲忽然活動市面突轉漲勢，杭州方面因上江來源見稀，致無貨應市，內坪油由五萬元漲至六萬元稍零，雙連雜油亦加至五萬五千元，時僅一週，各油均漲起萬餘元，實為打破半年來沉悶之局勢，記者此次旅行杭嘉一帶，觀察所得，存底極薄，高貨如禾本柏油統計已不及三千件，以應秋淘，恐有中斷之虞，且聞金蘭等處所存亦已無幾，故浙油已難望湧到，，惟漢柏阻在產地，數實不少，交通苟能圓滑，必有大批出運，而滬上可南可北，擇廉而取，不然無繼，且近日各號已向漢口採辦約一千餘件，聞麻城油合到申地至多不足五萬元，即日可到，浙油如此暴漲，必受打擊，各行售盤已隨市加增，計禾本油八萬元，內坪油七萬二千元，獨砠六萬八千元，的千六萬四千元，蘭油六萬元，麻城油五萬五千元。</p>
<h3>軟木五千噸　由挪威運滬</h3>
<p>（本報訊）大批軟木到滬，戰時軟木來滬絕跡，瓶塞大感缺乏，今悉天祥洋行經理之挪威輪，京海柯七號，自挪威澳司洛運來軟木五千噸，該輪前日傍晚抵滬，停泊浦東其昌棧起卸。又訊招商局海辰輪駛台，去貨不多僅約一千二百噸，其中以菜子餅三千四三十餘件為大宗。</p>
<h3>紗花布均疲滯</h3>
<p>昨日紗市價疲銷滯，緣各帮納胃極淡，　逢週末關係，市上成交稀少，廿支紗跌一二萬，小型紗尤為軟弱，因內地行市亦極不振也。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報跌十七至廿四磅者，計近期美金二九·〇六，遠期二九·二四，米特林現貨二九·八七，本埠現棉交易停頓，緣美棉回跌，兼以週六關係，厰家咸存觀望，未有談判，僅花號稍有點綴，市價平穩。</p>
<p>坯布續現疲象，因各方需要平淡，又逢中紡開售之期，大家觀望不前，各檔布疋均下二百五十元至五百元，惟士林布漸入旺銷時令，漂布貨稀帶平，中紡開售，掛牌之貨未見十分踴躍，嗶嘰未有，坯布價較上期跌五百元，午後嗶嘰昂五百元。</p>
<h3>在大戶拉提下　永紗邁步前進　大中華增資發息</h3>

<h3>五公會聯電經濟部　管制紗價之呼聲　希望紡建抑平市價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市手帕業內衣業針織業毛巾被毯業染織業等公會，因紗價騰漲，複製工業，因原料成本過高，製銷為難，經於日昨下午三時，在染織公會集議挽救方法，當經決定呈請經濟部實施管制紗價，以維生產，茲節録其原呈如次。</p>
<p>紗漲五千倍　物價三千倍</p>
<p>去年九月，二十支紗平均售價僅為十一萬七千五百元，今已漲至一百二十萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>較之二十五年高漲至五千倍以上，而一般物價指數，則尚在三千倍左右，其因提高原料價格領導物價上漲，威齊複製工業，至為明顯，敝業等初以對我競爭最烈，壓迫最重之日本紡織業旣經絕跡，國內與南洋市場國貨正可乘機振作，奈棉紗飛漲，複製品保本為難，關內市場且將為外人所佔，邊輪拓展外銷，設非抑平紗價，何以挽回颓勢，依據統計，二十五年棉花每担四十元，三十五年四月九萬元，其高漲倍數，為二千二百五十倍，而二十支棉紗，二十五年為二百三十三元八角，三十五年四月，一百二十萬元，高漲倍數為五千一百二十五倍，按諸二十支紗每件重量四百磅，應需棉花三百五十斤，以五月份平均棉花市價每斤為九萬元計算。則紗每件計需原料費三十一萬五千元，其他工資動力製造等費用約三四千萬元，合計成本為七十萬元左右，上月份紗布平均為一百二十萬元，所獲利潤在百分之七十以上，其他細紗之利潤尤且過之，當此棉產尚微，工資之鉅，捐稅之重，紗厰所售棉紗，能平衡應有利潤，平價發售，棉製品複製工業，已非洋貨之敵，今乃不顧一切，囊括高利，致棉製品廠家，停閉不得，開厰不易，不得不忍痛補進，以免原料之斷檔，其直接成本，不能控制，則不得不挖肉補瘡，少算間接費用，甚至貼蝕血本，以勉維生產，然入不敷齣，離總崩潰之日，已屬不遠，其中且有不少廠家，已無力支撑，終於閉歇，如是一業榮，而眾業枯，物價漲而民生促，覆巢之下，紗業難欲长享其利，又安可得，竊以為物價管制，為經濟未臻正常這應有措施，歐美先進各國，且多未曾廢業·</p>
<p>以米價為例　管制不容緩</p>
<p>即以上月本市米價而言，一經實施管制，即自七萬降至五萬以內，今對於衣著原料之紗價，猖獗至此，何可再事放任，國營中國紡織建設公司操持紗布，左右市場，更宜以身做則，抑平市價，民營紗厰如仍有高抬紗價者，則由政府强予抑制之，事非得已，成效可覩，豈衹敝業之所仰望，當亦憂國者之所同感，或以為紗價之高，出於供不應求。但以中國紡織建設公司現有紗錠而論，開工者僅及半數，其生產機能，原應擴充，苟非以暴利為目的，則抑平紗價，又何礙於生產之增加。敝業等為共維當前工業危局，保持棉製品業薄弱之基礎起見，因敢聯名呈請釣長鑒核，迅賜對於棉紗售價實施管制，規定最高利潤，切實增進生產，並飭中國紡織建設公司，首先實行，庶棉製品工業藉以生存，刦後民生，獲所昭蘇，不勝待命之至</p>

<h3>為了要求清算文奸岑維休　國民日報竟遭香港政府勒令停刊</h3>
<p>— 特約記者林友蘭</p>
<p>本報香港十一日航訊</p>
<p>這半月來，亞熱帶的季候風吹來的雨雲，蒙蔽着高峻的香港維多利亞峯，低沉的氣壓把人悶不過氣來，好像預兆將有一件什麽重大事情發生似的。</p>
<p>本月五日，委員長廣州行營公佈了通緝第二批漢奸的名單，因爲淮府恢復了民政軍政時期與我方的協議概歸無效，因此事前行營方面已特派參謀處處長李漢冲來港，與港督商訂逮捕漢奸的新辦法，不避香港比較特殊的環境，決心加緊進行肅奸工作。一般匿居香港的漢奸，面臨末日，人人自危，急求脫網辦法。</p>
<h3>民國日報　請通緝岑維休</h3>
<p>第二批名單中，有一個是經過本港輿論半年來力主查辦的香港頭號文化漢奸，華僑日報總司理兼督印人岑維休，（廣東恩平縣人，年五十許）。僑衆聞訊，同感興奮。七日的國民日報，即以「通緝岑維休」爲題，著論推動僑衆「採取一致的行動，對岑逆及其華僑日報作一總淸算」，幷提出三個原則：（一）必須活捉岑逆，（二）立即杯葛華僑日報，（三）嚴密注視岑逆及華僑日報移動資產器材。「請僑胞立即行動」。八日，工商日報以「爲了民族氣節與社會正義」爲題，讚揚我當局的肅奸行動，認爲「一向在港替敵人宣傳破壞抗戰詆斥盟國侮辱領袖」的「華僑日報照常出版，實在是社會正義的一大恥辱」，所以「希望地方當局對容許華僑日報出版一舉，認眞考慮」。又「希望本港愛國僑胞對於制裁這一附敵報紙，能有嚴正的表示，以維國家法令的尊嚴」。廣州行營駐港九軍事督察專員郭炳祺少將，亦於七日約見港中記者發表談話，要求「僑胞加緊注意奸逆行動，隨地隨時報吿政府，以盡協助政府逮捕奸逆之義務」。正義磅礴足奪奸逆之魄。</p>
<h3>港督下令　該報停刊一月</h3>
<p>八日午後，不料霹靂一聲，港督會同政議局發出命令：勒令國民日報自八日起停刋一月。據政府發言人稱：「此命令之頒佈，係因議政局對於本年六月七日星期五該報社論第二籲之內容—記者按：當日國民日報第二篇的社論是「共黨最後報國之路一，第二篇即上述的「通緝岑維休」—認爲是以引起民衆對於港方與中國負責當局合法引渡附敵分子之辦法發生誤會，且含有鼓勵民衆輕視本港法令與秩序之意味」，乃「根據一九三八年十月七憲報所載第七百七十五號政府公佈之一九二二年防衛法第二則第二十四條執行」。</p>
<p>就在這個法令由港府新聞處發表的同時約在國民日報通緝岑維休一文和讀者相見卅小時後，携有緊急手令的港府武裝警察，跑到我國中宣部設辦的國民日報社，執行封閉該報的任務。在該報對那個突如其來的勒令提出抗議一下，結果封閉了該報的辦公廳，字房和印刷所：用一根小麻繩一穿過門扣，麻繩的兩端給紅色的火漆印固封在一張寫有「此屋奉命封閉，閒什人均不可亂進，警司示」。等字樣的厚白紙上。大門外幷派兩名武裝警察日夜把守。九日晨，港僑看見各報刋出的「國民日報緊急啓事」和國民日報被港府勒令停刋一月的新聞，英廷賢明訓令提倡改革政制及敦睦中英盟誼的聲中，突發生少數頑固殖民地官僚蔑視我政府機關而鉗制輿論的事，故比去冬屛山機塲事件，尤吸引他們注意。記者九日下午五時曾拍急電略報其中情形，茲以法典所在，國體攸關，試就事件的前因後果，再爲關心香港問題的同胞奉吿：</p>
<p>自日本投降後，香港已成爲華南一帶大小漢奸的逋逃藪。忠奸不兩立，黑自須分明，便有肅奸問題的商討。本年一月八日，國民日報揭出「澈底肅奸」之論，同月十五日復著論「肅奸常從文化始」，十七日又有「文化漢奸何處去」的質詢。工商日報於二月六日，發表「中英合作搜捕匿跡戰犯」兩社論，同日該報晚刋，即刋出一封對附敵報紙詳述的公開信，其後以「請看附敵報紙醜態」爲題，陸續發表了華僑日報在本港淪陷時期的社論，都是華僑日報替敵宣傳的焹言惡語，令人讀之髮指！</p>
<h3>進行交涉　迭受環境限制</h3>
<p>其時，我當局已進行與港府密切交涉，但各報爲香港特殊環境所限，未能盡量發抒意見，呼籲作更進一步的行動。四月十九日，復刋不久的華字日報，著論向我駐港肅奸當局要求「懲辦華僑日報岑維休，」其用辭選句，已較前直截明快。華僑日報震慚於正義的大旗下，曾不惜出盡手段，極力掙扎，企圖挽回頽勢。記者五月八日「香港文化壁壘」的航訊，已有詳細報道，諒為讀者所憶及。當日國民日報曾著論「為民請命與奸絕緣」和刊出「為華僑日報投機等振災事敬告許世英先生書」揭破華僑日報騠取政要題辭，迷惑僑胞，發動振災，欺弄政府的陰謀，予奸逆無情的打擊。五月十七日，廣州行營發行公告通緝第一批偽組織要員或罪行重大的漢奸名單後，港中肅奸工作已轉入新階段，正義聲威，大見增長。五月廿四日，工商日報乃有「忠奸邪正之辨」的社論。行營第二批漢奸名單發表，各報目覩國法已定，認為時機成熟，暢所欲言，遂發生了國民日報被勒令停刊的不幸事件。但這件事在僑眾震驚之餘，倒教他們認識港府中頑固分子如何對待我政府的法令，和所設立的機關，又如何對待，已為本港百分之九十以上居民所不齒的附敵叛國的人物，同時也看到為什麼肅奸工作展開半年而遲遲未有顯著效果的一個原因。</p>
<h3>滿口英夷　顯有辱英劣跡</h3>
<p>恰如百萬僑胞做夢不到在我行營明令發表通緝漢奸名單後，戰後尤特別重視中英兩國友誼的港府，竟予代表僑胞言論的國民日報如此嚴厲的處分一樣，他們也做夢不到，自詡「以巧妙方式暗示於讀者之前以增强其信念」的華僑日報，會在國民日報被勒令停刋的翌日，在其「向全港僑胞說幾句話」的一篇社論的結論中，作「我們承當地賢明當局給予我們以莫大的激勵，益復增强我們興奮的心情和堅定的自信」的率直表示。華僑日報「巧妙」地用「激勵」兩字，把過去所闖下的彌天大罪輕輕地推到「當地賢明當局」的身上。華僑日報支持日寇破壞我國抗戰的行爲，在英人的眼中，姑且可以不論，但華僑日報過去滿口「英夷」「英夷」，對大英帝國及其王室的極大侮辱，難道也是獲得了「當地賢明當局」所激勵？岑維休一時得意忘形，不惟激怒了僑衆，也許更激怒了維護正義執法如山輿中國締盟修好的英國！</p>
<h3>珍重邦交　願英當局考慮</h3>
<p>英國當局的法治精神，向爲世界人士所佩服，而愛護中英兩國一百年以上，尤其在這次大戰中同甘共苦所築造的珍貴友誼的僑胞，對那戰前在特殊的情勢下所頒佈的防衛法，却適用於戰後在倫敦訓令下決心予人民更大自由的香港，十分注意，他們覺得經過這回太平洋戰事，惡狠的日本人雖然給盟國合力打敗了，但那條處分爲推動制裁大漢奸的國民日報的防衛法，戰前曾經容許日人在香港刋行醜詆我政府破壞我抗戰的報紙，該法既可適用於今日，則日人儘可來港再辦戰前的「香港日報！」有些僑胞更指出：該防衛法再由港府公佈的一九三八年，正是敵對我國的日人在港大肆活動之日，有此關係，他們正期待賢明的倫敦方面能够表示眞正的態度。</p>
<p>香港僑衆，自我最高統帥蔣委員長命令英國夏慧將軍代表接受已劉人中國戰區內的香港的日軍投降後，他們深信英當局已採平等態底對待他們。戰前種種不良的措施，當已不復存在。現在，我政府主辦的國民日報爲了主張以行動對付通緝有案的漢奸，雖受如許嚴厲處分，但僑衆仍相信對地方法尙如此奉行的香港當局，則對其近在咫尺一衣帶水的盟國的國法，當無蔑視之理，而迥護一個和其同類的通緝有案賣身投靠的漢奸，不惜犧牲百萬香港華僑，甚至四萬萬五千萬中國人民的友情，所以，直至現在，他們仍沒有失却對中英兩國友誼的珍重，記者有理由相信賢明的英當局也不會使他們失却這個珍重，同時引起全中國人民一致的反感！</p>

<h3>政府對流亡青年的責任</h3>
<p>編輯先生：承蒙貴報多多刋載着「流亡者的呼聲」這些文字，可是欣賞者也恐怕只有我們流亡的一羣！流亡的滋味，也只有流亡者知道，帶出來僅有的錢，而應付這無處不要錢的環境，饑餓和死亡的陰影，焉得不隨在我們每個流亡人的背後呢？但是我們不能等死，我們還要活着。我們都有會做事的本能，但是有什麼地方肯綠用我們這些衣履不週而又沒有「殷實舖保」的流亡者呢？我們對於抗戰，也曾盡過一番力量，如今勝利了，爲什麼國家却聽我們去，而不加以過問呢？我們不必空說我們的苦况，我們得要求政府，給我們事做，以我們的腦力，換取我們必要的衣食。我們得要求政府立即實行下列辦法：（一）舉行流亡青年登記；（二）集中流亡青年，使安定生活；（三）考試各人的學問與能力；（四）分派到各機關，學校，工廠，商店，使各事其事。上列四點，在政府是輕而易舉的。但是在我們流亡的靑年，不知要怎樣地歌功頌德呢！</p>
<p>蘇北一個流亡的靑年王紹上</p>
<h3>鹽城人民的苦難</h3>
<p>編輯先生：規時蘇北共黨已至根深蒂固階段，從前不過分區分縣，領導者尙未十分健全。自去歲冬月改區爲省，其省之組織，聞分爲八行政區，統轄蘇北皖北七十餘縣，而成立蘇皖邊區省政府，行政機構亦日趨嚴密。我人民益受煎熬，將陷於萬刦不復之地。惟以我政府旗幟高懸南京，不似從前遠在重慶可比，與共黨佔領之地，僅隔長江一衣帶水，吾人認爲危險性非常重大，不僅吾民流亡者身受痛苦已也。前覽貴報六月二日泰東代表呂國鈞等爲蘇北同胞呼籲一書，列舉各件，均爲事實，並非議言。政府如能派員調査，赫然震怒，舉師北伐，吾人庶有噍類。否則長江以北，無異爲蘇聯領土，眞正與蘇相聯，而不可救藥矣。吾人爲鹽城人，舊屬共黨鹽阜區，今改爲邊區政府第五行政區，所受共黨蹂躪，與泰東相彷彿。吾人所親身忍受而為泰東呂君等所言之未盡者，有如下述：（一）假託民意。共黨欲做一事，每次必假託民意開會，人民悮認爲民主招牌，悉心討論，結果當塲說話者，或即日或二三日即遭暗殺，或加以罪狀而殺之，吾鹽如吳季康·周鐵鈞·孫越·呂大才·喬月波·劉家淸·劉一靑等，均以地方重要士紳，猝遭殺戮者。試問尙有何人，敢再批逆麟？此事應請黃炎培先生等親往澈査，詳其眞相，庶不至再爲共黨所愚。（二）全民飢餓。共黨政府所榨取民財方法極多，其結果必使全民無一家能有食糧者。地主士紳，無糧可吃，朝不保暮，猶可且爲臣罪當誅，而其他人民，如工商·流民·及佃農，亦均以無糧可吃，同歸於盡。共黨所收之田賦公糧，則滿坑滿谷，所謂民主政府者，如此如此！（三）强征丁壯。共黨强征壯丁，每戶派充兵役一名或二名，名目繁多，有國兵·省兵·縣兵·民兵·擔架隊·輸送隊·慰勞隊等名稱。此時吾邑壯丁，畏其勢迫利誘，亦隨同地主士紳相率逋逃，否則輾轉溝壑。（四）侵佔土地。共黨侵佔土地方略，約分三種：（一）沒收，（二）算帳，（三）開河。有此三項侵佔土地方法，蘇北全部土地，已無一片亁凈土。（五）拆毁房屋。蘇北地方公有之廟宇·宗祠·隍廟·土地祠，不下萬餘所，均被共黨全部拆去。其他如士紳喬仲麟·胡啓東·馬永叙·徐崇達·吳彝白·洪爲洋等住宅，不下數百家，亦被共黨完全拆毀。吾鹽四鄉，幾無一住宅存在。敵僞在此，尙未有如此酷烈行動。（六）强搶什物。共黨令全部土匪流氓爲大算帳之策動，先向地主索取糧食，無糧之家，即令匪氓等將其所存之什物　　衣服等搶光。（七）凌辱婦孺。地主士紳為共黨所迫，紛紛逃亡江南，所遺存婦孺在蘇北者，共黨逼令組織婦救會，兒童團，以村鎭幹部逼迫遊行，令其唱秧歌舞，而該幹部則恣意調笑。誰無婦女？誰無家室？破壞禮敎，莫此爲甚。兒童團則迫令賽跑，有往往當塲跑傷，立時暈絕，或跑後而患　咯血症者，不可枚舉。共黨直欲鏟除我蘇北人種，又不僅攫奪我土地，搶刦我雜物而已。凡此皆泰東代表呂國鈞等所未及言者。現聞共黨已與我政府簽訂恊定，擬借貴報申訴，敬乞政府賜予電飭共黨部隊迅即退出蘇北，俾吾人得獲回里安居，不勝企福。鹽城旅錫流亡代表吳淼·韋偉夫·裔石岩·劉北瀾·喬日午·洪海·趙乙東·何奇同啓。六月十一日。</p>
<h3>港輿論界發表重要見解</h3>
<p>港中輿論界已開始對國民日報受港府嚴厲處分的事件發表意見，星島日報昨以「促進中英友好」爲題，對國民日報「爲了維護民族的氣節，整肅國家的法紀，而得到意外的遭遇」，表示「無限的同情。」該報引述我國近代史英日對華外交的過程，强調日人所犯的錯誤，而「盼望尊重歷史而開明的英國朝野和港府能够了解香港華籍居民的心理，甚至全中華民族的心情。」華字日報本日亦發表「中英合作與國民日報」的社論。據稱：香港百餘萬僑民經過戰爭，經過種種教訓，現在已覺悟了。現在斷不如戰前一樣可以隨便被人欺騙。被人麻醉。」最後說：「我們不願因小事而有絲毫傷及兩民族之感情，更不願因小事之發展而有絲毫阻碍兩民族之合作。願當局迅爲妥善處理。」據悉，港中其他華報爲維護我僑胞在港的地位及重申中英兩大民族的友誼起見，日內茲將有所表示。</p>
<p>據接近港府人士頃稱，當議政局開會討論査封國民日報時，以麥道高發言最多。麥力主引用不合時宜的一九三八年防衛法支持岑逆維休。岑逆之華僑日報連日對麥推崇備至。麥眞除本港輔政司時，曾大發「深慶得人」之論調。麥最近派出便衣警探多人，保護岑逋及華僑日報，並撥汽車一輛，專供岑逆出入之需。當多隨英軍返港時，（麥戰前爲倫敦駐港情報局局長，）傳岑逆曾饋以巨金；麥對港中其他漢奸，亦多有意迥護。港中僑衆因我政府駐港官員，未能採取有效政策，以維國紀，振人心，而任由漢奸敗類，趾高氣揚，不無失望之感。（特約記者林友蘭，十二日）</p>
<h3>廣州各界為國民日報事件　對港政府抗議</h3>

<p>經過八年長的犧牲苦鬥，我們在不平等條約下喪失的領土，許多都已收回了。還有爲了保持友誼而暫不收回的，恐怕祗有香港和澳門這兩個地方；然不幸得很，徧徧就在這兩個地方，尤其是在香港，却接二連三的發生了許多不幸的事件，常常使我們爲了「友誼」得到的酬答，而是人家的「不友誼」。我們看吧：也曾發生過許許多多如香港的葡警毆辱我們國軍…等這些，或者可以莫是小事，爲了有過同生死共患難的中英友情，誰吃虧了一點又怎樣？我們都不願去計較；可是，轟動全國的屏山機塲事件剛剛過去，而另一件不幸的事情又接踵而來，這就是最近香港國民日報竟因爲呼籲懲洽漢奸而被迫停版一個月。這一個不幸的消息傳來，使廣州人士都不勝驚訝和憤慨。香港政府這次派了大隊警察到國民日報去執行命令，要把該報社整個封起來。當時報社的職員們以如將大門封了。那大宗的住宿便成問題，後經再三要求，始答允祗將該報的辦公廳，排字房，機器房和編輯部等封起來。</p>

<p>我們都知道，香港的國民日報是中國國民黨宣傳部的直屬海外黨報之一，自從民國廿八年創刋，一直到卅年十二月日軍攻陷香港的最後一天才停刋。記得在是年十二月廿五日下午四時，該報在砲聲隆隆之下時，保衛香港的英軍已全部投降，日眾便從灣仔開到中環區。但當時該報同人，仍於廿六日早晨偕同當時由陳策將軍領導的忠義救國軍，在日軍戒備森備之下設法將報紙散發，並將擺花街的社址焚燒，始行撤退。這是當時在港的僑胞，無有不知道的。而過去該報主持正義的精神和言論，更爲旅港的僑胞所愛戴。到了勝利以後，該報奉中央的命令在港復版，當時已經由我國的軍事代表團曾正式知會香港當局，而且在香港政府的登記，是用中央宣傳部的名義。不料這次竟爲了呼籲懲治漢奸，在香港這個被目爲法治的地方，在世界人士一致要求新聞自由的今日，香港政府竟然以莫須有的罪名，並未經法律程序又未通知我任何機關，即遽行勒令該報停刋一月，而且還要封閉，這不僅是香港闢埠一百〇五年來所僅見，而且是任何民主國家未有的先例哩！</p>
<p>香港政府條文一斑</p>
<p>至於香港政府這次所引用條文，內容究竟是怎樣的呢？在一九二二年港府頒布的防衛法大意說：「假如香港在危險或緊急之狀態存在時，不能有下列的一端，否則港督有權執行命令處置。」而其中第廿四條大意是「不論任何刊物，不能引導人民不做工或與某商店絕交。」査道命令的頒布，係在香港大罷工之後，用以防備工人罷工而設。難道世界已吿和平的今天，香港還是在危險或緊急之狀態存在嗎？而且過去港府處罰報紙停刋，在緊急狀態時，最重大的事件，最多亦未被罰停刋超過廿七天的，而這次竟因此事件而採最嚴厲的處置，這足見香港政府顯然別有用心。其實，據另一方面的消息，這事情實有內幕：因爲岑逆早知他罪惡貫盈，一定難逃國法，所以拚命的巴結港政府裏的執政人，希望藉英國人的勢力來掩護。因此國民日報平時對奸僞的打擊，已是港政府時加注意的，不過這次才採取斷然處置罷了。當然，我們仍然希望這消息祇是個謠傳，不然的話，香港政府此舉，便有了爲岑逆維休張目的嫌疑了！</p>
<p>社長來粵有所報告</p>
<p>爲了這個問題，香港的新聞界同業，本來想聯合起來聲援國民日報的，可是後來大家想想，畢竟是在人家（？）的地方，第一攪得不好，不難會遭受到和國民日報的同樣命運，便祗好再圖其他方法而舊不明顯表示了！</p>
<p>該報的社長張湖生，在事件發生後，便跑到廣州來將事情經過報吿有關當局，並向國內人士呼籲。這理的新聞界也覺得香港政府這次無理的向我們同業橫加鞭撻，都無不表示非常憤慨。</p>
<p>召集會議議决諸事</p>
<p>除了著論對港政府抗議以外，並在本月十二日舉行了一個省市記者公會和報業公會三個團體的理事聯席會議，並決定由這三個團體推動再召集全市各界的大會。當時的重要決議有幾項：（一）通電全國促請政府循正常外交途徑嚴厲提出交涉，並請全國人士一致援助。（二）通電全世界人士籲請對香港政府之破壞新聞自由，加以譴責。（三）循外交途徑要香港政府迅即撤銷國民日報停刋處分的命令，並懲辦此次香港政府辦理此項事件的負責人。（四）在香港政府對我新聞界不友好態度存在時，香港當局答應協助本市報業購買新聞紙，及邀請本市記者赴港參觀等，均一切暫予拒絕。當時全塲情緒激昂，大有如不解決誓不干休之槪。席間更有人認為為了我們領土主權完整，我們應該「收回香港！」，在革命策源地的廣東，竟有着他國的殖民地，這簡直是廣東人的恥辱！</p>
<p>這次香港政府以這小小的事情，而對我政府在香港設立的代表機關，竟作如此不合理的嚴厲的處置，這顯然是對我政府絕不尊重，這不難將我們過去的友情都抹煞掉的。而我們最後的希望這僅是香港政府的錯誤，而不是英國的當局的。</p>
<h3>英國怎樣解决糧荒</h3>
<p>— 特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>本報倫敦四日航訊</p>
<p>英國的糧食生產，儘管不够的需要，但因運雜制度良好及準備充分，也居然在此舉世糧荒之中，毫無窘色。而且更進一步，對帝國的各部分，都有適當的布置，譬如就遠東方面說，現在到處需要糧食，惟暹羅尙有剩米，但暹邏米早就被英國指爲禁臠，祇許英帝國內人民的享受，不許其他國家分嘗。就英國有關的糧食問題而論·最棘手的·無過於德國境內的英軍佔領區了。英國雖够自活，到底也是很艱苦的；苦無餘力分惠到以前的敵人。所以德國英軍佔領區的民食自去年冬日起，已捉襟見肘，難於應付；祇能把分配的份量，一減再減，減至僅能勉强維持生存的程度。但減糧的結果，是生產力也減少，因此而引起的問題，已不簡單，不料其他蘇軍及美軍駐區的糧食，偏偏甚為充分。所以在這兩軍駐區由德人的營業，遠較英佔領區爲佳。於是由於德人心理上的反響，漸漸影響到管理問題，感覺需要設法彌補，非常迫切。第一，自然是要求英本國人民再節省糧食，製造啤酒的麥類減少了，軍人所分配到的口糧，數量減少，使與文職人員相等，同時節省麪包的運動，更由糧食部大規模的發動，到處貼滿觸目驚心的標語，勸人民莫糟塌麪包。但這類消極的辦法，收效難望其大，是必然的。於是糧食部大臣史密斯（Ben　Smith）更至美國去商量辦法。但美國的空氣，與英國顯然不同。在美國看來，整個歐洲在閙糧荒的時候，惟獨英國有存糧，英國不把自己儲存的糧食分出一部分來救濟歐洲，而專向美國乞援，彷彿很不應該。所以史密斯的使命，顯然沒有達成。英內閣不得已，最近又派下院的政府黨領袖摩理遜到美國去。而摩理遜的使命，已在某種妥協方式下完成。</p>
<h3>星期論壇　不要污損民主政治底實質！</h3>
<p>— 繆傑</p>
<p>「民主政治」眞是一個又古老而又新奇的名辭。自從亞里斯多德創用了這一名辭以後，就不斷地被各時代的人們，從不同的立塲，用不同的意義來大嚷大呌，高唱入雲。似乎所有的行動，只要加上民主的字樣，或是假借着人民底名義，就可以絲毫不負責任。在這種「民主政治」底外衣之下，不知掩蔽了或造作了多少罪惡，恰如人們濫用了「自由」一樣。</p>
<p>孫中山先生在三民主義裏吿訴我們：「要學外國是要迎頭趕上去，不要向後跟着他。」這一句話實在是包括社會，政治，和文化種種方面而言。可是現在一般改革專家和領導分子，都沒有眞正了解中山先生底比譬，以為僅僅學科學才要迎頭趕上去，至於其他方面却非要背誦或重演外國歷史不可。其實如果我們決心要從正確的方向朝著民主政治這一目標去努力，就應該首光避免幾百年來「民主政冶」過程中種種禍害，不要重蹈覆轍。</p>
<p>這種「民主政治」與底質，若在以社會的善意，從下而上，來有效控制着政府底意志，明白地說，在以人民底「公善」的意志來駕馭那些操持國家大權而實施統治的少數人底意志。一個國家底人民，少者數百萬，多者數千萬以至數萬萬。在這千百萬人民之中，一方面，我們不能像濾梭Rousseau都幹Durkheim輩認爲社會有超個人而存在的「公共意見」或「集羣意識」，也不能像一般社會契約論者認爲人民可以用締結契約的方式互相護與而構成單純一致的意志；另一方面，每一個人民都應該有表現衝動，運用智慮，發揮主張的均等機會，那末，作爲「民主政治」下政府行動底根據的（政府底意志必須包涵融會全國人民底意志）這一原則，怎樣才可以達到呢？通常有一種錯誤的見解，以爲要實現團體底意志，就必得貶抑個人底意志。其實這種理論是虛幻的；團體離開了個人，還有什麽存在呢？一座大學若是把學生和敎授通通屛除了，所剩餘的除了名義外，決不會有任何東西。如果每一個人都各各貶抑自己底意志是可能的，誰人底意志才能變成團體底意志呢？大家都沒有意志，也就沒有什麽團體意志。祇要個人底意志不要凌越別人底意志，個人底意志就會也必得永久和團體底意志相一致的。當千百萬人民底意志，滙流在一處的時候，彼此激盪，互相順應，就能在人性底諧和協調之統一過程中，從各個意志裏提鍊出利己利人的公道，合成最大最後最能廣包衆善之社會的善意。是以社會的善意不外是千百萬人經過各種途徑的考慮和判斷，而淬礪凝聚所成的「公善」罷了。這種社會的善意如果能够在事實上成爲國家法律底淵源和政府行爲底根據，就是「民主政治」底眞正的實現和完成。然而這裏也同時顯示出：「民主政治」底成功，必然要有賴於「法律主治」和「責任政治」兩個條件。法律一日不被尊重，一日不具力量，也就一日不能强迫少數有權的統治者遵從社會的善意。組成政府的最高當局，如果不對於他們行爲底成果負有自覺的責任，決不能保證社會的善意必被審愼妥當地執行。這就是說，健全的和圓滿的「民主政治」，人民不僅要能够產生社會的善意，還要能够集中全體底力量，作爲社會善意責付政府執行的最後制裁。</p>
<p>雖然「民主政治」底意義，不難說得淸楚，但是「民主政治」底精神却極容易被汚辱，被損傷，甚至被毁滅無遺。所以我們對於目下流行的種種引起混亂而迷惑的，「反民主」或「假民主」的倒退觀念，實在刻不容緩地有加以辨明和排斥之必要。</p>
<p>第一，「民主政治」不就是「多數政治」。在「民主政治」下，決不容許人民中某一個人底意志可以優越於另一個人底意志，或是這一個人底意志應該被那一個人底意志所支配。每一個人底意志都是平等的，都是有同等的價値，也都有均等的發表機會。多數人常比少數人較能知道社會價値，較能覺察社會需要，這是可以用歷史事實來證明的。又如說在多數人中，由於集思廣益，時常較容易有更多更高的知慧，也是不容否認的。但如果說多數人應該也必然要優越於少數人，或是爲着多數人底利益就得要犧牲少數人底利益，這是毫無邏輯的。易卜生Ibsen在「國民公敵」一劇裏提出：「多數人永遠是錯的，少數人總是不錯的。」這固然不免說得太過火，但是少數人底睿智和利益，決沒有理由可以不被尊重不被保護的。在一個一百人的團體裏，不能因爲九十九個人都一致認爲另一個人必須死亡，那一個人就應該很正當地被宣布死刑的。所以「民衆法庭」之類，實在不足爲訓。多數人底放肆，正和少數人底專橫，同樣地値得詛咒！</p>
<p>第二，「民主政治」不該是「暴民政治」。亞里斯多德在他底名著「政治論」Politics一書裏，就已經很聰明地指明：「暴民政治與民主政治的相衡，正如暴君專制政治與君主開明政治的相較。」依照亞氏底說法，在「暴民政治」之下，國內踞至高無上地位的，不是法律而是無知的羣衆；羣衆底命令必然要蔑視法律底權威，凶暴恣睢之徒，占據着國家底要津，貪利亡義之輩，無不攫取高官厚祿。可是自從法國第一次大革命以後，接着歐洲若干國家底暴力革命，一般人似乎又糊塗起來，認爲「暴民政治」正是「民主政治」底最高潮。這在中國，也似乎在某些地方刻意摹倣。然而在社會心理學者看來，暴民不過是一羣瘋狂盲目的動物罷了！他們每一個人都喪失了自己底理智，祗憑感情衝動，一味領導善人們向地獄走去，墮入畜牲道裏。無怪乎英國社會學者馬克伊維Maciver說：「羣眾是蠢笨的，殘忍的，不道德的，富於熱情，易於激動。縱使羣衆底熱情用在正當的地方，也不過是一羣傻子；如果用在不正當的地方，簡直就是洪水猛獸。牠祗知道做出些很簡單，很駭人的吼呌，牠祗知道破壞，不知道建設。在基督面前，牠祗選上巴勒巴Barabbas那個盜賊。」可怕呀！不幸這一種政治最近却認眞要在我們國土裏四處蔓延起來了！</p>
<p>第三，「民主政治」決不是「鬥爭政治」。「階級鬥爭」和「直接行動」是馬克思主義者工團主義者底拿手好戲。這種毒素，可以說是種因於對達爾文底生布競爭的學說所生之歪曲誤解。達氏從馬爾薩斯Malthus承襲這一個名辭，幷不專指生物底「仇視」和「競爭反應」，而是包含「動物間的相互依存」，尤其包含「個體底生命和傳後之成功」。馬克思Marx和恩格斯在一九一三年共產黨宣言裏說：「一切過去社會底歷史都是階級鬥爭的歷史」。這顯然是一種荒謬的武斷！任何社會組織決不能截然地絕對劃分成許多互相對立的階級，就連馬克思和恩格斯自己在他們底著作裏也還沒有對於社會階級有過明白的分析。固然，社會裏個人與個人之間，階級與階級之間，常有衝突和對抗的事實，但這決不是社會上根本的普遍的現象，祗有社會的「合作」和「交互依存」才是最根本的，最普遍的。假如社會分離的力量超越於社會和諧的力量之上，那末社會早經崩潰了，毁滅了，還有什麽地方可作階級鬥爭的戰場呢？並且也決沒有一個階級能够無限度地壓迫或摧殘別些階級而能長久安全生存的。自從克魯泡特金底「互助論」發表以後，人們就已確知人類底進步，乃原於「合作」和「交互依存」，而不是由於互相仇視。對抗和嫉忌。譬如工人與廠主間的對立，不管如何嚴重，尖銳，也還是表面的，相對的。無論工人或廠主，都必得要依賴對方底合作才能生存，才能繁榮。假如任何一方要以壓倒或摧毁對方爲目的，結果生產凋弊，經濟萎縮，就無異於自戕自殺。問題祗在兩方於互相依存的情形下，如何合理公平地去分配利潤罷了。所以中山先生說社會底進步由於各階級利益相調和而不是由於相衝突，實在是眞理。</p>
<p>第四，「民主政治」不再是「財產政治」。「民主政治」底發端，誠然是由於中等階級底財產的膨脹。因有擁有龐大財產的階級，爲了保持財產底安全，自然就敏銳地感覺到與國家的利害關係，而且有了財產也就有力量求取人格底發展和豐富，是以有產者底政治興趣總是比較濃厚，參加政治的要求也比較熱切，終至推翻了君主專制，奠立下「民主政治」底基石。但這決不能引生出財產必須永久控制「民主政治」的結論。現代「民主政治」在使人人都有均等的機會，參預決定政治的社會善意。然而，個人底才智經騐，旣不容否認有高下的差異，那末，個人在參政活動中的努力和社會價値，也就應該有優劣重輕的區別。可是，有產的人不一定就有聰明。財產和智慧，決沒有什麽相關性。財產也不一定是由於個人底努力和價値，這其間也沒有什麽比例關係。因此，財產在「民主政治」裏，實在沒有依據決定性和重要性的理由。如果財產一日還在左右政治，人民就一日談不上有均等的機會。如果財產一日還作爲衡量人們高下的標準，個人人格底效力就一日沒有社會評價的尺度。所以「財產政治」的觀念，我們必得加以唾棄。但也不是說，這祗須法律一經規定：「人人不受財產底限制，都可以取得公民的資格」，就可以做得到的。這總要從政治底內層裏，澈底廓淸，根本杜絕財產底直接和間接的勢力與影響。</p>
<p>第五，「民主政治」不一定是「政黨政治」。無論英美式的「民主政治」，或大陸式的「民主政治」，似乎現代「民主政治」底實施，都還離不開「政黨政治」。但這不能說明「民主政治」一定或必須是「政黨政治」。至多祇能說，在目前，「政黨政治」是實施「民主政治」的一個比較妥善的方法罷了。但這也不能就替目下所流行的各種「政黨政治」來辯護，說凡是「政黨政治」在現時都是値得歌頌讚揚的。政黨必須是一羣人民底眞實代表所組成的，牠底根底必須是盤錯於一羣人民底內在的人格裏，他不過是人民意志底傳聲筒，牠領導人民用適宜的方法來發揚自我，牠激勵起人民底政治興趣，並指示他們如何監督，如何評斷政府行爲的手段。牠除開了所代表的人民底利益以外，應該再沒有什麽政黨自己底利益。政黨奪取政權的鬥爭，也僅僅是人民意志決定政府行爲的反映。祗有這樣的「政黨政治」才是「民主政治」所能容許的。如果政黨離開了人民，或竟背叛了人民，人民也就厭棄了政黨。政黨如果祗顧說自己底話，不再傳達人民底意志，或連人民的意志都絲毫不加聞問，那麼牠抨擊政府，祇是發洩牠自己底私忿，和人民不相干，牠奪取政權也祇是爲着牠自己底利益，並不於人民有任何益處，其結果不外形成一種多黨的分贜而已！說什麽「聯合政府，」說什麽「各黨各派參加政治」，如果離開了人民，這與其說是「民主政治」底福星，毋寗說是民主政治底贅賊！</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「晏子」上有這麼一個故事：</p>
<p>晏子在楚，王使晏子酒。酒酣，吏二縛一人詣王。王曰：縛者，曷爲者也？對曰：齊人也，坐盜。王視晏子日：齊人固善盜乎？晏子避席對曰：嬰聞之，橘生淮南則爲橘，生於淮北則爲枳，葉徒相似，其實味不同。所以然者何？水土異也。今民生長於齊不盜，入楚則盜。得無楚之水土使民善盜耶？</p>

<p>最近幾天MP與SP在馬路上大提流動玻璃櫃店，攤販們的牢騷很多，認爲最寃屈的是非軍用品，也被這班洋大人一掃而光。</p>

<p>前些日子，曾發生一個美國水兵搶刧逃脫而開鎗拒捕的事，老實說，在他們一身精光（有一張漫畫，畫着他們赤條條的回國）而還不能回國時，喫東西不給錢，夜晚出來剝猪玀，搶刧，什麽勾當也都幹得出。深更半夜，馬路上MP與SP的巡邏吉普車的尖銳鬼嗥聲，正說明了日子過得不很安閒，攤販們用美金票收買他們需要出賣的小零碎，大槪不能算作有辜罷！</p>
<p>於戲！上海之水土，對華洋正一視同仁也。</p>
<h3>舞廳從業員的生活</h3>
<p>— 草雨</p>
<p>我是一個舞廳從業員。舞廳在一般人的腦海中，就存在了一種惡劣的不諒解的成見。似乎舞廳中的什麽都是卑鄙的無恥的下流的，不論是舞廳本身是舞女是一般的從業員（包括大班·侍者·賬房先生等）。舞廳是罪惡的淵藪，是墮落的源泉，是淫蕩的驛站。也許事實上，一部份從業員確爲環境所支配着，左右着；但一般人硬生生的却一定要將這一頂被認爲汚濁的帽子套上了每一個從業員的頭上去，也未免太過分吧。事實上我們中有許多就是不願同流合污的。我們所以要進舞廳的惟一原故，除了由於生活的鞭子驅策以外，怕再也找不出一個其他更確實的理由罷</p>
<p>睡眼惺忪　一般人以爲我們的生活，在這氣氛中，身心一定是愉快而歡樂的，因爲我們是終日的浸沉在芬芳的氣息，和迷人的歌曲的世界之中。其實我們所身受的痛苦，有誰能瞭解或同情呢？為了營業，人家正呼呼的好夢方酣，我們却纔營業興盛，工作繁忙。人家日上三竿，已半天的工作將過去了，我們剛睡眼惺忪的起身。每天自下午二點半開始，一直至晚上十一點半，實足九小時的工作中間，除晚膳的時間外，絲亳沒喘息的機會。一個普通的苦工也不過如此哪！憑這些，試問我們的精神還不够痛若嗎？</p>
<p>若是有人問我們待遇如何？眞是不說也罷：我們直接拿自老板的，少得簡直如同沒有。可是借職工之名所得來的附加棒賞，老板却給提去了一部份。除非是身受的，局外人也許難以置信。</p>
<p>一視同仁　有人還要我們塡一張什麽調査表。據說塡具此表的用意，在於以後憑此表發舞廳從業員服務許可證。內中有近乎滑稽的數項，計有「是否經過父母或丈夫的同意」？「是否訂有賣身契約」？「有否被誘失身？」等。天哪！從業員並不個個是舞女呀。這是同我們開玩笑罷。其實我們身爲男子漢的，那裏還會有什麽丈夫，所謂「賣身契約，引誘失身」云云，我們眞不懂怎會引用到我們的頭上來。</p>
<p>還有某些先生們，時常光臨到舞廳來，不是拍賣已過了期的週刋，使是强銷市上祗賣八九百元，而他們却要二千元一只的所謂美國玻璃梳子。往往又藉口調査爲名，到舞廳來跳舞。吃白食更是司空見慣的。有時侍者或在招待上稍有緩慢，或不週到一點，那一頓挨駡準是免不了。不打還算是運氣的哩！老板看見了，他會立刻走過來賠不是，並且將侍者無理由的訓斥了一下，因爲他們原是「官」哪！憑這一些也够了吧，請用歧視眼光來瞧我們的先生們！你們可以知道舞廳從業員也是「可爲而不可爲」的。「蓮子心中苦，」有誰會同情呢？</p>

<h3>天津馬皇帝內宅神秘嬪妃數十人</h3>
<p>天津「一心天道龍華聖敎會，」近遭當局査禁。會首「馬皇帝，」事先與副會首陶雲翔並四十五名年輕貌美的女會員聞風先逃。</p>
<p>「一心天道龍華聖敎會」起源於山東長山丁王莊，「創始人」馬士偉，字冠英，乃一土棍，向不安分，後竟異想天開，妄思稱帝，創設一天堂，以旁門左道誘導鄉民。該會共有會員十餘萬人：男女各半（按：妙就妙在男女各半）其中以河南，山東，山西等地爲最多。</p>
<p>據警局統計，自去年八月迄今，自這座「皇宮內院」曾先後招出香消五玉的『嬪妃」三十七名，她們「不約而同」的都是因爲「敗血症」而致命。</p>

<p>天律會址，於淪陷期內遷至楊家花園四十七號，而積寬闊，佈置華美，其富麗堂皇之情形，一若宮室。會中人員全係會員，外人一概不得混入，即差役，車夫，瓦匠，木匠，成衣，廚司，皆由會中人自辦，儼然一小天下。會主內宅，尤稱神秘，亦最華麗，置美婦數十人，即「馬皇帝」之嬪妃。</p>
<p>「馬皇帝」除廣收門徒，封大臣，納嬪妃不算外，並擅改曆書，訂一月四十八天，一年十八個月，會員咸留髮蓄鬚，高帽左袵，極盡妖異之能事。</p>
<p>據說有一次社副市長，胡社會局長到該會視察，適逢這座謎宮擺着蟠桃大會，杜胡垂詢倒底是誰的壽日，號稱「國丈」的副會首回答：「是無極聖母的好日子」，臣子們說是「爸爸的生日」，嬪妃們又說是「娘娘的壽誕，」牛頭不對馬嘴的答案，把這兩位賢明的長官也給裝在葫蘆裏了。</p>
<h3>論花襲人</h3>
<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>紅樓夢中的花襲人的臉譜，却有點像現在被捕後的漢奸的共通典型。</p>
<p>她，做丫頭的時候，失身於寳二爺，是不得已；賈母原欲她好好的照應寳二爺，自應屈已承歡。寳二爺出家後，她，離開大觀園賈家，又離開自己的哥嫂家，也是不得已，因爲她不想以自己連累了別的人。最後嫁給蔣玉函做少奶奶，還是不得已；一片好心，怎忍輕拂？在紅樓續夢的續貂之作裏，寫她又和寳二爺破鏡重圓，想來也是不得已；因爲故劍情深，一日風流百日恩，花姑娘不能做無義的娘子。</p>
<p>現在被審的漢奸嘴臉怎樣呢？有的說：爲了生活的鞭子難捱：這是不得已。有的說：爲了敵人的綁架逼迫，在刺刀前無法挺直自己的腰，這也是不得已。有的說，爲不忍收復區的老百姓受苦，爲了救人，才投入渾水缸，本悲天憫人之願，抱「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」的跳火坑的精神，這，更是不得已。有的說是身在曹營心在漢，有的是蘇武牧羊七八年，……總括一句，做漢奸，是因爲不得已。</p>
<p>豈但是不得已，而且還在做「地下工作」哩！</p>
<p>紅樓夢時代的女人貞操觀念，和現代人們的國族思想，是同樣重大的。餓死事小，失節事大。所以襲人終于是個淫賤的女人，她做了禮敎的叛徒，漢奸是人類的渣汁，他們做了國家民族的叛徒，都該予以唾棄。</p>
<p>以上是就兩者論列，現在再專論襲人。</p>
<p>就事論事，她也是個悲劇性的可憐憫的人。先說她失身，紅樓夢第五回的標題，便大字的揭出「賈寳玉初試雲雨情。」此一「試」字，正說明她是無辜的做了寳二爺的愛情試騐品，祗是供大爺們玩弄而已，二爺對之何嘗有什麼真情真意。然而，她自己最低限度對此不幸事件，也要負担三分錯。因爲她對事情比寳二爺曉得多，而且，還似有略誘之嫌。始時輕簡，結時自是草率。樹倒猢猴散的塲面，在訂情之夕，便可以推想得出。</p>
<p>她所以如此曲意承歡，正如公館中的小大姐巴結大少爺，交際塲中的小家碧玉向公子哥兒飛媚顏同一心理：中了虛榮之病。</p>
<p>追求虛榮的，絕得不到虛榮，熱中虛榮的，必被虛榮所燬，地位不平等而能交好，眞是難得的奇蹟。因爲在你盡心盡力，在他還漫無所感，在他略分酸餘，在你已是受寵若驚了。喫虧的，還是底下人，奈何虛榮之病不能除，眞是奈何，奈何，誠坑壞不少人也。</p>
<p>再說她改節，她不是寳二爺屋內人，沒有經過明路，根本是無節不守，這從形式上說。從實質上說，實二爺已是不愛她，所以才出家，「卿既無情我亦休」，她又要為誰守節來？</p>
<p>所以她的嫁人，就現在說，實不値一論。我所引爲奇異的，現在頗有一家一姓之忠實走狗，主人畜之也許還不如襲人，却節義凜然，一副冰霜面孔。誠不知為誰守着節來？恐怕還是爲了未來飯碗，也許想以此獻媚求其寵納之故吧。</p>

<h3>香蕉</h3>
<p>— 幼新</p>
<p>不嘗香蕉味，甚至于不見香蕉色，已經有八年之久了。這次從大後方逃難似的到上海來，頭一次看見香蕉，就發生了不可思議的愛戀。呵！香蕉，你的顏色黃得可愛，你的香味也是自然界中無雙，香蕉我如果有花一般美的愛人，我寧願將她拋棄，我可以把愛她的全部柔情，都用來爲你。如果我有耀眼的黃金，我寧願兌成鈔票來換你。可是，香蕉；我是個窮小子，金條有雙大眼睛，它從不走進我的腰包。</p>
<p>前天，我在南京路一家水菓店中，又瞥見了你的芳容香蕉，我彷彿看見你的眼珠死勁地盯住我，你用手頻頻地照呼我。常時我的心砰砰地突跳不已，臉上陣陣發熱。我曉得你鐘情於我，我一非草木，二非鐵石，青春的愛戀之火，燒得我好難受呀。我偷偷地，用戰慄的手從荷包里把鈔票掏出來。天哪！只剩一百元了！我想哭，苦無一滴眼淚，但我敢向你起誓，我愛你，我永遠都是愛你的，可是我怕買你不起呀！</p>
<p>我並沒有絕望，羞怯地進了水菓店的門。一個驕傲的店員向我迎面而來。他用搜索的眼光把我打量了一番，問道：」</p>
<p>「先生，儂要買啥？」</p>
<p>「我要買香蕉，多少洋鈿一只？」我接着又問他。</p>
<p>「起碼兩百洋鈿，儂買幾只？」</p>
<p>「太小了！阿拉弗要買！」我覺得說話語音顯得怪可憐。</p>
<p>「小？有大格！儂買弗啦？」他有點不耐煩了，</p>
<p>「弗買！」我慚愧地搖搖腦袋，瞧了那串香蕉最末一眼，匆匆地垂傷地離開了店門，一心只想哭，眼睛似乎也不敢睜開，深怕這世界上有人看見我。</p>
<p>唉！別了，香蕉，暫且別了。你也許不會了解我，因爲我令你感到失望。但我還是要求你的寬恕，待我將六月份的稿費領了，我再來訪拜吧！你再見了……</p>
<h3>吃辣火醬</h3>
<p>— 冷峯</p>
<p>做公務員的朋友，每月的收入，即使是竹字頭階級的大亨，也遠不及一個鶉衣百結的黃包車夫，這是人人所共知的。然而，這也不能一槪而論；因爲老是坐在辦公室中的人，只有拿些死薪水的，當然遠不及一個黃包車夫的收入；要是你的工作，負有外勤的任務，或者担任了庶務和會計，自然另有生財之道，因此，死坐辦公室的朋友，對此生財有道的能手，免不掉要生出嫉妒心來。然而這嫉妒心也不能作正面的衝突，這怎麼辦呢？拿筆桿子的朋友，說話方面是多少有些藝術作風的，於是就有了下面的談話了。</p>
<p>在吃飯的時候，大家把筷子在一只辣火醬中撈着，甲先生在面前吐出了幾粒骨頭說道：「怎麽，這廚房真是能手，內中沒有肉的，我老是吃着骨頭。」</p>
<p>乙先生接着說：「你沒有本領，只好吃些骨頭，肉是早巳給人家吃去了。」</p>
<p>丙先生也笑笑的說道：「這未免太不平等了，吃肉的吃肉，吃骨頭的吃骨頭。」</p>
<p>丁先生也來接着說道：「你有些骨頭吃到已經也不差了。我是吃骨頭的福氣都沒有，只能撈到豆腐亁。」</p>
<p>一桌坐着八個人，有四人這樣的說話，還有四人，有的裝做不聽見，照舊一口一口把白飯往嘴裏送，有的不說話，面上只表了一個會心的微笑。</p>
<p>不論古今中外，整個的社會，都是這個樣子的。</p>

<h3>請臭蟲張嘴喫兩口DDT看</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>前第三方面軍接收日軍軍品委員會上尉副官馬維良，因强佔上海環龍路花園別墅廣東女子梁慕如所住房屋，旋以黃金四十兩出頂；梁女遷居亞爾培路凡爾登花園後，又被馬逐出佔住，且將其全部傢具衣物佔據，致被吿發拘究；湯司令以馬敗壞軍紀，依懲治貪汚條例治罪，於十一日午後綁赴無錫車站執行槍決。如果說殺一以儆百，那我就希望把馬某的頭切下來，最先送上海，在虹口一帶縣首示衆幾天，再運平津京漢各地，週歷一次，即使無多效果，也好呌人民快意快意。</p>
<p>哈陷幾年之後，上海路面破壞之處極多，因此坐三輪車在路上行駛時，逢到路面破壞之處，便須曲折讓避；初以爲車夫深恐顧客不勝頹廢，所以特別小心；後來才知道，原因爲了車行規定，輪胎損壞，須由租車者負擔修理。曲折讓避僅僅爲了自己，初無求見好於顧客之心。而在不知不覺中，却已做到了「利人利己」一點。</p>
<p>香港「行總」四千包食米失踪，茲悉當局在港九到處偵査，結果已在兩家米店中發現。還好！還好！原贓俱在，尙幸未爲離民搶去，如果爲難民槍去，豈不早已分而食之，那裏再會吊到原贓呢。</p>

<h3>記余上沅先生</h3>
<p>— 草辟</p>
<p>在上海的報上，讀了陶熊先生一籍「念余上沅先生」，禁不住把我的印象也勾動了起來：這位可愛的老頭兒！如今已經白髮蒼蒼了。</p>
<p>他執掌劇校十年是不容易的；常劇校邊江安後，更是個艱苦時期；請不到敎員，招不到學生。然環境雖艱苦，但他是樂觀的，因而把江安艱苦的階段波過了。這樣的刻苦是有代價的，它創造了輝煌的功績，不久就得到敎育當局的嘉獎；劇校改專了，從三年制的職業學校，改為五年制的專科學校，眞是「實至名歸」！在江安還有件苦的事情：大家都嚷着搬家，搬家！最後他給大家下了個精明的結論，他說，要搬家成功，首光就要把我們學校弄好來。在這個指示下，大家不再談搬家，努力做學問，彷彿他們競爭的對象是北碚的歌劇學校。結果，這個努力便贏得了勝利；敎育當局要他遷移北碚，並裁撤了歌劇學校。他爲了訓練更優秀的人材，便擬定了『三三制』，分初級中級高級一貫九年，讓從一個兒童起，就給他染上戲劇的知識，這樣才可以訓練出一個無惡習的戲劇人材，而正確的達到所謂戲劇的「天才敎育」的目的。我在這兒預祝他這個新制的成功。</p>
<p>他辦學校的成功，還有種自由的精神。我想，再沒有一個學校比劇校更自由了，出　報·開討論會·文藝晚會……差不多每個星期都有，就因爲這樣，使學生們有更多的硏討·觀摩·實習的機會。在這些塲合中，他是來得最早的一個，他認爲這些同上正課一樣的重要。</p>
<p>他的歲數和我們離得很遠，但他的精神却是同我們站在一起的，他沒有架子，他隨便，跟誰都談得來，誰都是他的朋友；對工友如此，對敎育部長也是如此。有一次他說：「我們學校經費沒有××學校拿得多，因爲我見了部長不會坐半個凳子談話。」</p>
<p>他的生命力是那麽的强，不論在那兒，他都可創造個快樂的環境，快樂的事件；比方看演戲吧，他說：『你們要學學我，不管多　壞的　，你也得好好的去欣賞，欣賞，不要一碰着就拿亞里斯多德的理論去批評；』是的，正確的批評，原是應該從欣賞開始啊！</p>
<p>他抽烟的時候也想到戲劇，『烟絲皮裏純』給他發明不少的「玩意兒」。比方「戲劇　」，這在每年劇節的時候都會吃到，戲劇餅上是個喜劇的面其，我們吃着，就好像八月十五吃月餅一樣……還有現在全國通行的上演稅，就是他導演「視察專員」時開始的。在江安時，沒有電燈，只有用煤氣燈演出，因爲沒辦法控制，他就　導一位第四届的學生黃約翰，製造了一種能控制煤氣燈的燈光器，那就是劇　　聞一時的「約翰燈」。現在許多巡迥的劇團都仿製「的翰燈」作下鄕公演之用。還有，在學生吃得太苦的時候，他又想到了「憑物看戲」，演一次戲，劇塲門口就像菜市一樣，堆滿了的「營養」。</p>
<p>然而，他也更深的　戲劇思考着、想着怎樣和時代配合起來。這，從幾篇文章中便可看出來：一是「送戲劇下鄕」。一是「送戲劇回營」。跟着就劇校同學從軍，有半數去報名，在比例上，佔全國學校從軍成績的頭位。</p>
<p>他的學識是淵博的，在他廿五年戲劇生涯中，他辦過國立北京藝術專門學校戲劇系，及北平小劇院，中國戲劇社，他發行過「劇刊」，「新月」，「學文」，他敎過北京·淸華·復旦·曁南·華等大學他在廿四年曾受敎育部聘任赴歐洲考察，他還做過「新月書店」經理，他担任過「威尼斯商人」「視察專員」「與賽羅」「野鴨」等劇導演。他寫過「塑像」「兵變」等劇本，他又翻譯過「可欽佩的克萊敦」，他還寫過「與戈登克雷及史坦尼士拉夫斯會談記」、他還演過「壓迫」；他有如此的成績，也許有人說他曾留學美國卡內基大學及哥侖比亞大學的緣故吧，然而，他却老老實實的吿訴過我們：「他在求學時代曾借過茅房的燈念死書」。</p>
<p>可是現在整日忙行政，連讀報的功夫幾乎都沒有了。</p>
<p>上沅先生今年四十九了，白髮蒼蒼，然爲了戲劇敎育，仍不遺餘力。他說過，活着的目的就是爲了後輩。把學生看成他的子女，他們將繼續他的戲劇事業。他認爲「生命的義意在創造宇宙繼起的生命」，這就是他生命的哲學。他書房裏永遠携着一付立軸，他常常凝視着，他常常微笑的唸誦着：</p>
<p>「愛國家，愛戲劇，愛母校，愛同學！」</p>
<h3>上海話劇總評之二</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>四·「山城故事」</p>
<p>這是苦幹劇國演出的一個劇。這劇的導演人就是「萬世師表　」的導演者。劇作人也是「萬世飾表」的劇作者·演員中也有兩個是「萬世師表」中的演員。因此使我們奇怪，它完整的程度和嚴肅的水準並沒有和「萬世師表」相同。演員的演技也沒有「萬世師表」整齊·這，也許是導演者沒有很嚴肅的負起責任，也許是演員間事起沒有聯系。所以有少數的幾個演員顯得凸出。</p>
<p>演員中最使人滿意的是馬笑儂演的莫嫂。最明顯可以使我們具體舉出的一塲：蔡洪山派向天鶴到堆棧去以後，又打電話給關大元；麗珠知道向天鶴會給人家抓去，所以買通了莫嫂去追他回來：她剛一出去，蔡洪山就進米找她，因她不在就問莫嫂；莫嫂止要數數麗珠給她的鈔票，一見蔡來，趕快把鈔票藏在背後；起先她沒有說出，只是支吾着，後因蔡摸出手槍威脅她，她才驚慌地吿訴他；麗珠到堆棧去了。蔡洪山一聽，也追了出去。莫嫂才安心下來點她的鈔票，並　出麗珠給天　的十八自信。這里，她鬼鬼祟崇的注意着麗珠，看到蔡洪山手槍時的驚慌，　珠給她　時的猶疑，蔡問她時的欲語不語，最後點鈔票時的喜悅，都表現好，而是整個地抓住了這短　無智的性格面創造了外型。</p>
<p>其次，石揮演的蔡洪山，能把他的狠毒全都演出，也是一件　不易的事。例如：他開一張支票給向天鶴，而被天　拒絕、因此大怒。他因憤怒而突把聲音提高，並布一轉身之間，止好一掌打在鋼　板上。這使他的生氣，和富時的　圍生色不少。過後因麗珠的解勸，他在走到門口時說：</p>
<p>「你想想，支票在這兒。」這一塲戲，可以說是全劇最精彩的一段了。</p>
<p>再次，就是演韓二的沈揚。這人物是過去書香門弟的公子哥兒，現在是個破落戶，什麽事都不會做，只會吹蕭喝酒玩盆景，也許是年輕時喜歡玩兒錶，所以現在還會修錶，喝了酒還會發年騷。完全是一個自命不凡的風雅人物和中了毒的上流人。因爲是這樣他就成了社會上的廢人。沈掦抓住了這些部份，發揮了他整個優秀的演技。他　這一類人物一活現在觀衆眼前。例如：他怕向受之，在他醉後要受之和他玩盆景，不料給受之把盆景打破了。這是他依命的東西，人家出他十萬高價他都不願意出實，現在給打破了，但他不敢和受之吵架，只嚷着向外面走，可巧給汽車碰傷了招回來。這些，沈揚完全控制了這性格，一貫地無一處過份，也無一處不够地把他演川來。</p>
<p>其他演員也都很稱職，惟水準的不够整齊，殊覺可惜。</p>
<p>在苦幹的演出中，這劇可與「金小玉」並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>五·「雷雨」</p>
<p>這劇本的問世已經快有二十年了，它是被人稱爲救命戲。無論那一個劇團到了賠本不能支持下去的時候；只要一演它，就可以繼續地使劇國存在着。記得我去年上半年在貴州安順縣的時候，軍醫學校國風劇　演了兩次盛都賠本，負責人因爲、兩次演出費都是由公家墊款，到期非歸還不可，所以很着急。後來有人提議演「雷雨」。果然，這個戲非但使賠的錢　了回來，並且還餘了錢做下一次的演出黃。因此一，更使我相信「雷雨」是一個救命戲了。</p>
<p>上海最近在　心大戲院演正的「雷雨」，並不是那個劇　正式公演，而是幾個名演員集合在一起，作一次　擊戰。</p>
<p>這劇的演出，並沒有導演的名字，也沒有集體導演等字樣。在演出裏看，舞的畫面和演員的走動，的確是糟到不可再糟的地步！</p>
<p>在佈景上，我們可以明顯地看出很多畫的綫條和形狀。因此使我們感覺到十分的假。</p>
<p>演員中表最不能現性格的是演周冲的那位；他穿着雙排扣的新式西服，和白色鑲黑的皮鞋。就從這些上看，也不是一個周冲。其次，周萍是一個臉色蒼白瘦弱的人，而演員動作的敏捷，嗓音的宏亮，使我們得到了一個非周萍的性格。而演魯貴的演員，在這裏買弄了一點見小　頭，引起了觀衆的笑聲。最使人覺得奇怪的是：第三幕中魯大海問他要錢退給周冲時的「不給，不給，給。」的三句答話，演員是用同一的語調，同樣的聲音說出。這，常然是引起了觀衆的笑聲，但與性格並不十分適合。我好像記得：劇本並沒有這些話。</p>
<p>女演員們要比男演員們嚴肅得多了。她們到沒有在劇中玩弄小噱頭。但是，男演員中也有比較嚴肅的，那就是演周樸圓的喬奇。</p>
<p>這劇本似乎給改動得很多，這些改動是為了演出者們迎合觀衆低級與趣而爲的。但是它只損害了劇本的一部份。劇中原有的</p>
<p>這劇在營業上是相當的成功但在藝術的成就上却很成問題。一整個的說：營業的成功無法換回　術上失敗的萬一，在演出上，除了劇本以外，只有看演員們的法寶。所以有人說：這次演出只是一八仙過海，各顯神通」。這神通並不是高貴的演拔，而是低級的　頭。但不可抹煞的：只有少數幾個演員比較嚴肅！</p>
<p>六·「新官上任」</p>
<p>這劇舊名「羣魔亂舞」，在抗戰初期就已經問世了。因爲現行政治舞台上有此官僚們的作風太惡劣，所以還沒有使這劇失去其意義和時間性。它是描寫在敵軍控制下的一座空城，由一羣流氓地痞來扮新官，去上任。上任一後的作風是欺壓老百姓，阪買遠禁品。結果給人民攻人城中，把他們生擒活捉。</p>
<p>劇中的陳萬與在第一慕中調戲劉殿元的姘婦孫大娘，因此到最後一幕中有孫大娘把劉殿元販賣軍火的消息吿訴陳萬興而使雙方反目，引起劉殿元把孫大娘殺死，和陳萬興動刺刀的事情。這一段的因果，劇本中只是在第一幕裏很　的勾一筆，其他幾幕中並沒有使陳萬興和孫人娘的事明朗化起來。而導演者在地位上也沒有把他們拉在一起暗示出雙方關係。所以。到後來說孫大娘走漏消息很不可信，這也許是導演者的疏忽。</p>
<p>演員中以宗由捕捉的形象駁明顯：穿了火褂不扭扣子，或是把大褂掛在臂上，長摺扇插入衣領，手裏托着鳥籠，活像一個流氓。惟說話語調稍慢，好像太「溫」。</p>
<p>羅　演的小白菜，她能把妓女的一付毫「不在乎」的樣子演得絲毫無剩。在靜的時候，好像懶得動都不想動；在動的時候，立刻舞動雙手氣勢汹汹跟孫大娘打架。劉二要　她的時候，她乾脆地把衣襟拉開露出胸來讓對方刺。這些動作活活地勾出一個　女的性格來，介紹給觀衆。眞是把這個人物很眞實的演出來了。</p>
<p>方伯演陳萬典。第一點可　揚的是：他是一個胖演員，但他沒有利用他的外形，用一種惡劣的低級趣味的噱頭來逗引觀衆，而是嚴肅地用他高貴的演按來使觀衆注意他。他在劇中是演一個屠戶。他只穿一套舊香雲紗的短褂褲，光着脚穿鞋，手拿一把芭蕉扇，這外形已經　像一個正在休息時的屠戶了。第一幕中和孫大娘的調情並不使我門有惡劣之感，這就是他的舞台道德和不玩低級趣味的表現。最後一幕中的打架，也並不因身體肥胖而使動作遅緩，所以呌我們感到很真實。這位胖演員和過去那些只知玩低級噱頭而不知演技，只憑外形玩弄觀衆的演員是不可同日而語的。</p>
<p>這劇的演員陣容比較整齊，雖不能說演出上是如何的整，但是相當的可以。演員也都各有春秋，但不是個人發展。</p>
<p>演員之道德在於使演出上完整，而不是使自己如何的凸出超過別的演員。</p>

<h3>影片批評　從軍歌</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>據說這是一部會經轟動過陪都的好片子，又聽說它是根據一部　動美國的名影劇所改編，但是我看過以後却看不出它的好處。現在我在藝術上對這部片子說幾句話：這部片子戲劇性很淡薄，只有南處地方是好的，（一）會參加第一次世界大戰的軍士們現在又看到了第二次的戰爭，而且更看到了他們先前會經住過的兵房麼；一個人還哼出當年舊歌……同時眼看着他們的兒子也都一一重覆的担任了他們的任務。（二）後代中也有軍士樂隊歌劇的演出，前代人則輔助督促着後代的舞台工作。當幾個老頭兒在舞台上跳躍，他們的妻子兒女在台下觀看時，實給人以很好的效果。</p>
<p>除這兩點以外當凱蒂史密絲唱出「天佑美國」時幾個家家戶戶傳誦的鏡頭還相當活躍，但與</p>
<p>「嘉會良緣」中唱出「我想我在戀愛中」一節相比較則差遠了。</p>
<p>在軍隊表演中用以男代女，這是實事，攝在片子上。第一次獲得的效果不壞，但他一次一次的不惜應用，那未免將效果逐漸减少。</p>
<p>一次見到舞台上的大規模操兵，總是好的，兩次見了，就會减少興趣，這與前述是同一原理；雖然它背景常常更換，但這裏畫川搭出不動的背景砥能給人以一兩紗鐘的喜悅，至於那所剩餘的其他部份又每給人以平凡的印象了。</p>
<p>我不懂導演為什麼要把這戲一拍得如此緊守着舞台的範圍，簡直就是把攝影架子放在舞台下，向着台上拍攝，台上一幕演員了他也停，待換了佈景再攝下去，使觀衆雖在看電影，其感覺仍在一看舞台戲。</p>
<p>戲中穿插羅斯福總統，馬歇爾將軍到塲看戲，也是增強「適應美國民心」的編製，然而却用了遠景——代替品——關於這一點我想即使是美國人也是很失望的。其實像這一類的片子只要宣傳得力，即使眞請羅總統加入一個鏡頭，也不是不可能的事情。</p>
<p>戲在編製上說也很平淡，前半部利用字幕的塲所很多，這雖然可以給觀衆一個「色古香」的感覺，但是監製人總不要忘懷了使觀衆們的討厭總比甚何問題都重要，三十年前的電影重映，決不是能受大衆歡迎的一回事。</p>
<p>全戲缺少高潮。</p>
<p>瓊李絲莉的一個角色毫無重要性，結婚不結婚的問題好像前後有些矛盾，我相信美國男人決不是大多數深明大義因打仗不顧與他們的情人結婚的，那麽何必要借　納李根與瓊李絲莉兩個人來打倒這個問題呢？一個女人在戲然中，如被採用爲軍人的情人，其有不少的用法在，何必取決於這一種筱寫。</p>
<p>佈量方面，在舞台劇上說是好的，在電影上似乎不够，塲面方面多了幾塲沒意思，少了幾塲也不可惜，以水手站在船前的一塲爲最精彩。</p>
<p>演員方面，喬治幾翻傷足後在台上表演一塲是好的，其他勞納李根，亞倫海爾等等均是平平而已。</p>
<p>總之，這部戲在美國是可以轟動的，在我國則不然，尤其在和平後的上海。</p>
<h3>遙遠的愛</h3>
<p>— 迂夫</p>
<p>中電二廠第二部新片</p>
<p>中央電影攝影塲第二廠在徐蘇　領導之下，已完成了吳永剛編導的「忠義之家」，該片不久就可以和本市觀衆見面。中電二廠當局見外片充斥市上，大批外滙流出，所以想積極攝製影片，用以抵抗外國片，故于「忠義之家」工作完畢後，立即開始第二部新片「遙遠的愛」的工作。</p>
<p>「遙遠的愛」是陳鯉庭編導，演員有趙丹，秦怡，吳茵，張雁等。</p>
<p>這是一部具有歷史性的叙事片。全劇時間的十六年，從片中女主角阿伶做娘姨起，經過阿珍受敎育，做敎授太太，參加一二八淞滬戰爭的看護工作，又參加八一三的戰地服務，直至抗戰勝利時回來離別她丈夫為止。</p>
<p>這一部片子中，劇作者告訴了我們：社會環境和人物影響會使一個人決定以後的生活方式，是偉大還是渺小！</p>
<p>該片故事開始的時候是寫：</p>
<p>民國十八年冬，蕭元煦敎授在上海婦女協進會講演，因爲時間太久使他的愛人朱曼麗等得不耐煩，引起兩人的不快而破裂。蕭元煦敎授因此想自己來創造一個理想的太太，于是，他家裏的年輕娘姨就做了他的對象。</p>
<p>蕭教授把自己的　識傳授給了阿珍，使阿珍不再是娘姨，而是「位摩登的余小姐了。她在婦女協進會負責人吳小姐的影響之下參加了婦女工作，使她知道了許多過着艱苦生活的女工。同時她哥哥受了日本人的欺侮，從工廠裏跑出去常了兵。她父親也窮得無法生活下去。</p>
<h3>紐約奇譚</h3>
<p>— 馮長</p>
<p>這部片子很好，是由幾段短片組合而成的；在我的總評中該是「甲下」，它有濃厚的戲劇味，比「靈與肉」輕快而精彩，</p>
<p>全片計五段，第一段細膩，第段輕快，第三段含意最深，會你使在含笑中流淚，第四段不可承接上段的餘波，第五段是結束，可以使你逼緊了的心很舒服的鬆弛下來。</p>
<p>片子的主角是一件大禮服，却爾斯鮑育，却爾斯勞頓，琴逑羅吉絲等　都是配角，但是配得十分精彩，每一個人都可以給你滿足以上的需要。</p>
<p>在「好」之中，再挑好的，還是兩個却爾斯，和琴逑羅吉絲</p>
<p>在本報上，我本想評此片的，但因時間關係，先在此作一介紹，容在他報上再詳評之。</p>
<h3>舞台技術講話</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>三，色彩的象徵</p>
<p>色彩的象徵，是由於」、種厂史，風俗，宗敎，經數千年或數百年，幾乎固定了的引起人的某種情感與聯想而產生的。懂得這種厂史情感的反映與聯想，便能隨我所欲的將這各種色彩象徵的力量運用到佈景上去，不但能表現某劇的特殊情調，替人物預備適當的情緒，而且更能使佈景產生一種意外的神秘底活力。支持着戲劇更高的藝術價値。茲將各色之象徵，分列於后：</p>
<p>一，鮮紅：象徵流血，悲劇，危險，毀滅，犯罪，勇敢，倔强，復仇，忿怒，熱情，貪慾，巨聲，愛國，虔誠，純潔，高尙，華麗，有强調力，創造力等。</p>
<p>二，粉紅：二象徵眞理，愛情，美麗，羞色，健康，迷惑。</p>
<p>三，　紅；象徵愛國，美麗，榮譽，怒，血。</p>
<p>四，深紅：象徵至誠，博愛，仇恨，鬥爭，幾暴，悠雅，大方，優美。</p>
<p>五，暗紅：象徽屈服，尊嚴，單調，低劣，貧窮，秋天，和修道士。</p>
<p>六，橙色與虎珀：象徵狂笑，輕快，活潑，快樂，滿意，豐富，秋天，溫暖，火。</p>
<p>七，鮮黃：象徵金子，日光，光明，高貴，溫和，輝壞，富裕，皇室，豐收，和平，莊嚴，放恣，嫉妬。</p>
<p>八棕色：象徵屈服，安息，專心，緩慢，悲哀，成熱，沉悶，充實，欺騙，不長久，笨。</p>
<p>九，黑黃：象徵疾病，毁滅，欺騙，懦弱，妬嫉不長久，笨。</p>
<p>十，綠黃：象徵和平，靑春，快樂，豐收，甜蜜，接吻，活潑，愛情，舞踊。</p>
<p>十一，鮮綠；象徵靑春，生動，天眞，信仰，靑年，未成熟，不刺激，希望，和平，計劃，勝利，永久，微笑，勝利，健康。</p>
<p>十二，諚　：象徵沉默，神秘，理想，詩歌，抑　，憂愁，屈服，遼遠，孤高，冷淡，信仰，神聖，可憐，未熟，寂寞，安慰。</p>
<p>十三，鮮藍：象徵偉大，沉靜，無事，神秘，舒展，肯定，眞理，穩固，　　，莊嚴，悲哀，希望，愛，忠心、忠實，沉默，永恒，冷靜，成功，冬天，沒有同情心。</p>
<p>十四，暗藍：象徵和靄，謙虛冷淡，悲哀，深沉十五，紫：象徵希望，愛情，華資，誠懇。</p>
<p>十六，靑紫：象徵愛情，眞實，冷靜，憂愁，悲哀，愛情。</p>
<p>十七漫紫：象微悠美，文雅，老年，微悲哀。</p>
<p>十八，紅紫：象徵皇室，溫暖，莊戲，沉着，刺激，冷靜，屈服，富麗，愉快，高貴。</p>
<p>十九，黑：象徵下賤，魔鬼，罪惡，魔術，死亡孀婦，懊喪，修道士，失望，過失，悲哀，嚴肅，沉默，神秘。</p>
<p>廿，白：象徵犧牲，謙虛，樸素，廉潔，眞理，光明，和平，天眞，貞潔，較美，柔弱，神仙，天使，鬼，聖母，聖女，先哲。死亡，恐怖。</p>
<p>廿一，灰：象徵暴風雨，狡猾，冷淡，嚴利，晚年，素靜，忠實，秘密，沉靜，安詳，悲哀，憂愁，肅靜，退隱，陰慘，澳傷，凄凉，貧困，衰頽，寂靜，沉悶。</p>
<p>這些色彩所象微的情調與各種不同的特殊性質，在選用時，必須依據其不同塲合，來决定它所表現的不同效果，換句話說；同一色相在不同的劇情中將得到不同的意義。如紅色作爲客室牆壁的色彩，我們就感覺到熱烈的情調，在另一劇中，將紅色的光投射到戰爭的佈景與人物上，我們就感覺到仇恨與流血。因此我們知道，單獨的光色與染色，本身是無固定的象徵意義，它的象徵意義的發揮，是必須配合着某一種劇情，與人物佈景。反過來說：只有這標，親衆才算準確的獲得它所象徵的力　。（未完）</p>

<h3>讀畫三記</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>貽德由重慶經西北而至滬上。已及一周，今天，乘美專授課之便，晤談良久，並請其展實　，得閱四年來　歷浙，閩，贛，桂，湘，蜀，陜，　，豫諸省而寫的小品凡五十餘件，循藝術發展的路線，一覩精心傑構的眞面目。</p>
<p>去年十月，他在給我的信中曾說：</p>
<p>「……藝術的傾向却逐漸在揚棄舊的，向進步的方面追求，前兩年在東南一帶所作的都是水彩和素描，大都以現實生活爲題材。我曾經爲了描寫　　的生活在江西大庾的西華山住了一個星期。今年暑假，在一家工廠裏和人們一起生活了一個月，描寫他們的工作勸態。近來正以這些畫稿爲題材，每天關在房裏製作大幅油畫。…」</p>
<p>從這些言詞之中，使我是如何地憧憬於他的充滿現實的作品。可惜得很，這次，爲了路途的跋涉，僅帶了這一些水彩和素描的小品，而大幅油畫，還要等國立藝專遷校東來時帶走。</p>
<p>雖然僅是一些水彩和素描的小品，可是，我們可以確切地知道，貽德是如何地要把現實表現出來。小小的風景書上面，使我們感受的，不單是恬靜，閑雅，而是配合着大衆艱苦生活的縮影，是靜與動的合奏，像「拾石子的士兵」，「嘉陵江畔」，「西華山」諸幅，在堅實的造形感與實在感以及畫面的講或與統一之下，我們是深切地感受了內容與形式得到統一的藝附術高度的表現效果。</p>
<p>還有素描，我們只感到線條的堅勁綿密，從這些線條的構成而獲得了完美實在的造形感。</p>
<p>藝術家，應該在大衆的隊伍中體驗生活，否則作品是不會眞實而感人的。</p>
<p>我前天已經發表了「劉獅展魚」一文，今天，在參加海翁爲他書展而辦的招待茶會，並再遍讀其作品之後，還想寫一點觀感於下。</p>
<p>獅子是洋畫家，彫刻家，工藝美術家，他是以過人的聽穎而通過造形美術各部門的一個成功的作家，抗戰期間的開始作毛筆宣紙，淡彩的所謂國畫的硏究，無須奇怪，這不過是表現藝術的另一方面的發展而已。</p>
<p>獅子的作品，以魚爲主，而這些魚，在形態上是沒有一尾雷同的，而且，能在薄薄的宣紙上，又把水的浮動，透明的性格，表現無遺，是一般國畫家所認爲難能可貴的事。</p>
<p>中國藝術的創造，固然要在內容與形式統一的途徑上找尋出路，可是完美的描寫技術的探究，是絕對不可忽略的。只有內容，沒有形式，結果是會陷于宣專性，紀錄性，說明性的作品，藝術的價値是全然沒有的。</p>
<p>還得注意，一般國畫作品，在技法上往往是拘泥於占人的成法，非宋即元，論山水，則荆關董叵，言花卉，也需靑藤白陽，這些成法，往往會使一個作家受到拘束。李成云：「師占人，不如師造化。」是擊破這種因襲傳統的成法的重大啓示，獅子的作品上，已經能够表示接納這個重大的啓示了。</p>
<p>在抗戰期中，有很多的藝術家，把製作的內容，轉移到大後方民衆的現實生活上去，用着簡單的器材，作忠實的描寫，定十六日起舉行畫展的吳作人，就是走這麽一個道路。</p>
<p>作人，差不多費兩年多的時光，走向靑海，西藏，西康，甘肅諸省，這遼遠廣漠的地方，那裏有原始的生產工具與生產手段，原始的舞蹈，原始的裝飾，以及那遊牧生活的現實情調，高山，大沙漠，駱駝，冰雪，牛皮筏，帳幕，……那些江南水鄕所不能見到的現實，都在作人的作品中問描寫出來。</p>
<p>作人大部是用着所謂水彩畫的技法來描繪的，雖然僅是輕淡的一薄層的色彩，可是發生極和諧的對比，尤其是在康藏民族的那些服裝方面，富有東方的單純，原始的裝飾感的色調，不到西北的人，也許是無法想像得出的。</p>
<p>從他的少數素描作品上，我們又可以感到寫實功力的深湛，輕捷的線條中，把現實的眞實感抓住無遺，如果不是這樣，那麽有色彩的作品決不會如此眞實的。</p>
<p>藝術品的內容，應該擴大範圍，從作人的許多畫面上，會使每一個　居斗室的作家獲得一個啓示。</p>
<h3>新安江畔的歌女（小說）</h3>
<p>— 張羅</p>
<p>悶熱的夏人的傍晚，一陣雷雨過了，新安江的上空，出現了一條由紅·藍。·靑·紫四種顏色織成的美麗的虹，弧形，跨着東北二方的天的邊緣。</p>
<p>白雲在山中飛舞着，親愛地呑吐着太陽；雲塊移去，乍透露出來的太陽光芒，是那樣的惡相，不自然和不能逼視。</p>
<p>兩岸雜樹像被兜頭澆過于盆水一般，茂密新鮮的葉子上，一滴一滿的水珠朝下滴着，滴在亂草中。</p>
<p>裏的小魚益形　　活　了，一簇一簇的，在水上，苔蘚下，石縫裏，穿梭一般地游蕩着。</p>
<p>東頭，瑤一　鎭土小茶館裏的小徒弟在上鬥了，山後邊，部隊表的號聲也響了起來……</p>
<p>晚飯後，又大又圓又亮的月兄已經坐在樹頭上，W，H，君和我散　地坐在草坪上，聽劉　長吹噓着他的風流軼事，忽然，那淸脆而抑鬱的少女的歌聲，被那支離破碎的胡琴　托着，又在新安江畔響起來。</p>
<p>「去溜躂溜—」侉子劉排量蠱議着，於是大家站起來，拍拍褲子上的沾泥，朝江畔走去。</p>
<p>不知從那天起，那老年的渡手從對岸給我們搖過來這位長睫毛，大眼睛，皮膚黑黑的淸秀的少年歌女和一個中年婦人兼琴手；也就從那天起，每當月升之時，新安江畔便開始有了歌聲—有時候它忽西地徘徊着，有時候則停泊在江畔的鵝石灘畔。</p>
<p>鵝石灘中十來把小凳子上圈形的圍坐着聽衆；他們一壁呷着茶解渴；一壁揮着蒲扇納凉，一壁並眯着眼咧着嘴傾聽着。年靑的姑娘，打着兩根辮子，穿着一件竹布旗袍，被圍在當中，面仰向天，一聲聲的吃力地在唱，婦人的不　　的手指，在絃上起落着。</p>
<p>光撫摸着聽衆，也撫摸着歌女，遠處，林裏似乎起了霧，對岸，老年的渡乎把　子解了，掉過船頭朝這邊搖過來。</p>
<p>二十多雙眼睛貪婪地盯着歌女，憂愁恐懼刻在臉上她的歌喉也變得虛慌和顫抖了……</p>
<p>四圍對她是一種壓迫啊！</p>
<p>歌聲被埋在掌聲裏，過後又從掌聲裏逃出來，大家聽得很起勁，一隻完了又來一隻。</p>
<p>「喂！呌他們聽完了不要走，等人走完了我們……」劉排長心血來潮了，扭着我的耳朶說，一會兒，我把這意見轉達了大家。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>正月裏來正月正，</p>
<p>我帶小妹妹去看燈，</p>
<p>看燈是假意喲，妹喳；</p>
<p>調情是眞心……</p>
<p>劉排長在一旁，喘着氣……</p>
<p>月至中天了，睡魔悄悄地走來，　着椅，拿着壺，無力地揮着蒲扇，拖着疲倦的身子，聽衆一往回踱了，連打着呵欠。</p>
<p>姑娘坐下，把錢數了一遍，交給了婦人之後，便一手托着顆，面對着月亮嘆氣—好蒼白的面色！</p>
<p>婦人竟　地打起磕睡來……</p>
<p>新安江畔只剩下了我們六個人？</p>
<p>「……你們代我……」侉子對大家支吾着，沒有一個人肯接受這個使命，雖然大家都明白他的要求。</p>
<p>結果還是他自已上去。</p>
<p>「老太太……」侉子為難地回過頭來，羞澀地刺我們看了一下，我們立即退到遠處樹下，看着這幕「？」劇的進行。</p>
<p>侉子指手畫脚地同婦人嘰咕了半天，吃驚之餘，婦人顯得躊躇和爲難地樣子。看她走過去，拊耳問歌女、歌女儘搖着頭，婦人又對着她的耳朶？……</p>
<p>「前進！」W君小聲地命令着，於是四人就同夜中偸襲一般地，朝前輕輕地爬行在地們後而的一顆大樹下我們停住，屛住了氣。</p>
<p>「兩千塊吧。」</p>
<p>「先生，東西太貴，你們還在乎兩千塊錢……」</p>
<p>「兩千塊不少吶！」</p>
<p>「實在買不到東西……」</p>
<p>「那就算了吧！」</p>
<p>「先生，做好事……添一千塊吧！」</p>
<p>「兩千，要幹就幹！」</p>
<p>「先生……」婦人朝歌女看了一眼。「先生，不能再添了嗎？……」</p>
<p>「唔！」</p>
<p>「好—吧！……」婦人低下面。</p>
<p>排長從腰里掬了一把遞給婦人，借着月光，婦人以顫抖的手一張張的小心地數着，新出版的鈔票，被擦得「沙沙」作嚮……</p>
<p>排長走過去，把坐在地下的少女拉起來，婦人停住了一切舉動，呆癡地望着。</p>
<p>「我們到那邊野地里去……」排長拖泥帶水地說，拉住　　要走。</p>
<p>「媽！」她突然轉過身子像　　過去似地，兩手朝他母親求援地伸着，發着犯人在臨刑時作最後掙扎地悲慘，絕望的呌喊。</p>
<p>「……母親的回答跟着眼淚湧出來，我的鼻子酸了……；</p>
<p>「媽！」</p>
<p>「可…憐…的…孩子……」　「媽，你也……」</p>
<p>「好兒子，我不能　……」</p>
<p>「媽，我怕！」</p>
<p>「不…不要緊，先生，很好……」</p>
<p>排長向前背着，姑娘被套在排長的堅實的臂膊上，跟踉蹌蹌地跟着　朝西邊曠野里奔去，漸漸地他倆消逝在迷霧里……</p>
<h3>同感的微笑</h3>
<p>— 宋夢芹</p>
<p>T先生S小姐各據了沙發的角，在翻動着書頁，他們拿起工廠管理，放下了會計學，檢出了商業心理又丟開了工廠管理。每讀了兩三頁，或許是翻了兩三篇，T一定是下意識的剝開一塊糖，或是一隻茘枝送到S的手　，然後自己在怱忙中還要拈起一支Camel來，畢竟分數還有那麼，一點權威，他們的情話居然暫時　正了。</p>
<p>走廊上一陣相細間錯的脚步聲，他們知道來的一定是C先生利他的未婚妻G小姐。於是TS的精神振作起來。</p>
<p>「你們在受罪啊！」C一面脫一下值的草綠的太陽眼鏡，一面笑着說。</p>
<p>「你們都預備好了吧？」T被一種希望的心理促着他發出了這句問話，這希望是要有對方的一句相反的答話，才是他滿意的。</p>
<p>「煩死了，好好的「少婦多悉」不能去看。」G的話　輕　的從她桃紅的兩片翹起的薄唇間吐露出來。</p>
<p>「你說是預備書嗎？對不起，書給我什麼保障嗎？我們學工商管理就走錯了路子了。你看，市而的怪象，就差棺材不要美國運來了。到我們實地管理工商的時候，工廠公司還有幾個存在呢？」C帶嗟帶怨的不知是為公還是為私還是為了明天的期考勉強自　。</p>
<p>「完了，完了。中國簡直完了。Hopcless……」T長在歎着。</p>
<p>「就是僅有的一絲工業的微息，也要被人窒死，完了，還談什麼復興？工業破產，直接影嚮經濟，經濟破產要比政治動搖更要危險，如何得了！」C一面咽着S公館聽差送上的冰橘水，一面更加深了地的憂思　並且有些帶着憤激的熟情，從他的眼睛上表現出來。接着對S說：</p>
<p>「小姐少做兩件麻布衣裙吧，祖國危機就在眼前了。」</p>
<p>「該死！找到我身上來了，玻璃背帶鬼才用呢！」S才說了這句却吐了吐舌頭回頭看了一看T，巧好T今天是穿中裝的，於是又說下去，眼光却轉向C小姐：</p>
<p>「小姐，玻璃皮鞋少買兩雙吧，祖國的危機就在眼前了。」大家一陣哄堂，在這繼續的笑聲中，浮出了G小姐尖嫩的語調來：</p>
<p>「好！明天我們就開始糾合同志，復興我國工商業，我們要開始幹起來！」T的情緒非常熱烈，手上的半支烟與一本商業心理一幷丟到地毯上。並且補足了一句，似是而非的老調：</p>
<p>「我們進行，要大處着眼，小處下手！」</p>
<p>「不錯，大處廣眼小處下手！」</p>
<p>「當然，大處着眼小處下手！」</p>
<p>四人莫朋所以的大聲呌着，一似中風工商業已由他們在開始復興着。</p>
<p>然而T有些倦於這個問題了，並且送S的端節禮品問題暗暗又在胸中作祟。但這該原諒他，S小姐的禮物從來是挖盡了心血去計劃而難得她的滿意的。</p>
<p>突然間C在高歌起來了。而H他的身子被那歌聲彈出了沙發外。他在唱：</p>
<p>「嫂嫂織布，哥哥賣布。……」</p>
<p>三人不的而同的合着，而空氣是更現活躍了。</p>
<p>「嫂嫂織布，哥哥賣布，賣布買米，有飯落肚。</p>
<p>嫂嫂織布，哥哥賣布，</p>
<p>小弟弟褌破，沒布補褲。</p>
<p>嫂嫂織布，哥哥賣布，有誰買布，前村財主。</p>
<p>土布稀，洋布細，</p>
<p>洋布便宜，財主歡喜。</p>
<p>土布沒人要，餓倒了哥哥嫂嫂！」</p>
<p>「啊！農村經濟衰落，家庭手工業破產，資本家金錢作祟，外貨勢力猖熾……這一隻歌寫盡了現代中國的……」C也許是太激動了，因而中國的什麽也一時想不出合適的字眼來，只好歔欷了一陣，以結束這段語辭。</p>
<p>他們似是有一種「時間不早了」的同感，於是四人都有準備外出的意思。S小姐是早已和T的好四點鐘到霞飛路去，所以她關照聽差一句：「太太回來，說我和T先生出去了。」</p>
<p>他們同時走出大門，却是兩東兩西，互道一聲「明火會。」</p>
<p>當T和S穿過了邁爾西愛路走進了Grigorieff公司時，却正看到C和G在麻布的陳列部檢選花色。無意中八隻眼睛相觸時，各人相互的報了一個同感的微笑</p>
<h3>雜寫</h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>在今日的社會上，能幹的意我已近於會掉花槍，老實簡直成為一種缺點。你要生存，就得蔑視你所受過的那套仁義道德的教誨，雖然，那套教誨依舊要掛在你嘴上，用來教訓你的孩子或者騙騙和你有利害關係的人。</p>
<p>過去，我年青，天眞，—今天，我也還年靑，可是卻慢　地離大眞遠了。天眞的心曾讓我相信書本上的敎誨，前蓋們耳提面命的敎誨；到今天，天眞慢遠了的今天，我却感到的徨惑。我不知道我究竟去生活—怎樣去賺錢養活着巴，怎樣發展我這個人，這個性格，這一腦子的思想。</p>
<p>單憑我這樣一個最起碼的公教人員的收入，我是無法養活我和我一個小家庭的。另外謀發展吧，我不會，因爲我不能幹。我每天八小時在辦公室裏忙够了，那兒再有剩餘的精力？我這種不能幹，也許就是不會掉花槍吧？不會掉花槍，也就是太老實，太老實，就是一個缺點，有這個莫大的缺點，我也就失去了在這痼社會上做人的資格。</p>
<p>不能活下去，而我終於活下去了。當然，吃固然吃不飽，　倒也是餓不死的。我就這麼生活着。生活着，除了為生活忙，就是思攷。我的腦子到今日還有說攷的能力，這不能不算是一個幸運。我希望着一切總會好起來的，黑暗總會過去的。我思攷着，究竟我們爲仕麽要生活？我們爲什麼要讓生命延續下去？如果今天的情形永遠不變，或者變了，却變本加厲，那麼，我們人類還是全部罷王的好。讓我的手罷工，我的嘴罷工，我的循環器官，呼吸器官罷工，讓我們的腦子罷工，思攷罷工。讓生活停止，生命停止。然而，這一天是不會有的，生活總是要繼續下去的，因爲我們還有希望啊。</p>
<p>我們的希望在我們的祖宗腦子裏就存在着了。這希望存在於每一個人的心裏。但是，你一個人是無法到達這理想之境的，要到達這理想之境必須全人類有一致的步伐。而人類的步伐却一致不起來，至少是，在今天確實如此。於是，有人被稱爲能幹，又有人却被稱爲掉花槍，有人被稱爲老實，又有人加被稱爲無用。總之，這是一個奇幻的世界，是無法解釋而又無須解釋的，</p>
<p>我怨恨今天，而也讚頌今天。因爲明天是必須經過今天才能到達的。然而，在路上，千萬不要　　　得我們　頭痛的希望啊</p>
<p>六月九日，於虹口</p>
<h3>黑夜</h3>
<p>— 楊治福</p>
<p>我睜開眼，眼前　然顯出一陣漆黑的世界，而這世界好像就只有我一個人，一切黑夜的進　都應該向着我似的：而且，除了旁邊伶的低微的呼吸聲，這世界是顯得不能想像的死樣的沉寂……往常，儘你在什麽時候，只要你張　耳朶醒著的時候，船埠上多少總會發出一些　雜的人聲或是一聲浪潮撞擊的音響。我不知道整個的長夜已過了多長，但壁上的時鐘却正敲三下，告訴我已是天快亮的時候了。</p>
<p>我時常這末想，我需要光明，我不能有一刻功夫生活在黑暗的環境裏。但現在，現實逼使我不得不作這末完全不同的想法，面對着這黝黑的世界，我有着異樣的感觸，我的思想塞滿了希求光明和　憎黑暗的矛盾的心情，而一切奇怪的想頭，也似乎我住了我這個弱點，侵人我的腦際，使我不寗靜的心，更增進一步。</p>
<p>漸漸地，我的思想進人了一種迷糊的境地，我經歷了一些人生的痛苦，我也聽到一些生命的呼喊：　「難友們，不要呻吟，</p>
<p>我們得把牙根咬緊！</p>
<p>又粗又長的鐵練，</p>
<p>把我們捆成一條心。</p>
<p>我們冒着黑暗前進，</p>
<p>我們向着黎明前進！」</p>
<p>我見到，成千百萬的婦孺老弱結束了流浪的生涯，回到自己蒼涼的家園，但還沒有立定脚跟，却又從他們自己的家園逃出，重新過他們流浪的生活，奔逐在街頭。我也見到不知多少的餓屍躺着在冷落的街巷，有的甚至至還張動着嘴，支持着他最後的生命，等待死亡。……我的整個的心房，都被一些悲慘的情景佔據着，我不能抑制我正在燃燒的心情，而眼淚也就爬癢了我的臉孔，掉落在枕旁。</p>
<p>幾分鐘過後，我起來燃亮了燈，逐走了室內的黑暗，翻開一張不算太早的報紙，想藉此减少我不寗的情緒，但正埋下頭的時候”一個相似的鏡頭又在我眼前展現了：</p>
<p>「到××，我們××鄉看災，××鄉有二萬四千人，據說有二萬人沒有飯吃。鄉民們從瓦礫中跑過來，紛紛跪在路邊央求我們，「天老爺！你老救救我們！」眼淚一顆夥沿着眼眶滾下。他們在火燒過的荒地上搭草棚居住，吃樹皮草根——地草花，葛根，欖倒皮，穿心草，鵝芽菜，蕨根，還有糠和麥壳。……」往下是一些迷糊的悲傷的字眼「出賣親生兒女……賣了兒子，妻子跳水……」</p>
<p>我抬起頭，不忍再往下看了，同時，我的心也感覺到一針針的刺痛，這是事實，我還有什麽話可以說呢！我只有閉上眼睛靜默着！</p>
<p>突然，壁上的時鐘比先前多敲了二下，而從窗隙處也漸透于進）了微弱的光芒。於是，我知道黑夜已趨近結東，接着來的就是淸新的黎明！我打開窗扇，以一股迷惘的心情迎接它。</p>
<p>光明於我是一種多麼高貴的佔有啊！天亮了，有誰還高興留　這黑沉沉的長夜呢？</p>

<p>老闆娘一貫熱心地趕着作了兩套花布衫褲送給裁縫司伕，過門（北方謂媳婦到婆家去，爲「過門」。）那天，小紅便穿了這身新衣服。沒有舉行什麽儀式，老闆娘把祭灶節和娶童養媳兩件事併在一起，請了三四張桌子的客。同時順便又替那些被開掉的回春堂的夥計們餞行。老闆娘的算盤打得精，一舉三得！</p>
<p>開始作了「童養姒」的小紅，這天打扮了下，臉上敷些粉，頭上的那條細長辮子梳得光光的，扎了根紅頭繩。由裁縫司伕送她到了麼家，向廖老闆和老闆娘磕了頭，又向屠伕月老和長　戚們確了頭。然後，老　娘把廖棟呌了過來見見面。但是廖棟連頭也沒抬，更不用說拿眼睛去看小紅了。</p>
<p>這一切寳鈴像看戲一樣，覺得好奇，也覺得滑稽的很。他想笑，可又想哭！他可憐小小廖棟無辜地被老闆娘像要猴戲似的要着！「廖棟眞是一頭綿羊呀！」寳鈴心裏說。他想：要是這件事擱他身上，他一定不恁麽乖地任着他們擺弄，他會和他們爭吵；反抗；更會跑開去！他會這樣對付過墨太太。但是廖棟不敢！他不似寳鈴，墨太太是實鈴的生身之母！生之之母是可以躭待自己的孩子，而後娘便不會。所以廖棟悲哀！好在廖棟已經比從前心胸開闊了些，他不曾爲這件事過分的煩惱過，因爲他也把這件事當作戲一樣地看，演！</p>
<p>廖老闆和老闆娘都很高興，廖老闆高興的是家裏添了一個帮手。三五年後讓他們成了親，自己就可以抱孫子了。俗話說「人口旺，財才能旺」！想到這裏，他恨不提早替他們成親。老闆娘她沒有這麽想，她只知道這件事的完成，是滿足了他向廖棟，以後廖棟的生母，報復的一種私心！妙爲　高興，爲將可以發洩嫉妬與殘酷的本性面高興！</p>
<p>談到小紅自己，她比廖棟的心裏複雜，也許女孩子比男孩子成熟早，况且　究竟長廖棟兩歲。她在沒有來廖家以前就能意識到這種婚姻的關係，她會爲這種關係竊自喜悅！如今，她見過廖棟—這未來的將作她丈夫的人以後，她除了竊自喜悅，而且感到羞澀！她喜悅的是：她從此有了依靠，她悄悄注意這個家的一切，她看着一切部勝過自己的家，她想信她將不致再挨餓。她夢想有一天她還會帮助她的爹媽！不再爲累她的爹媽而痛苦！她羞澀的是現在作了人家的童養媳了，有公婆；有小丈夫；想到這裏多麽不好意思呀！她直覺得她的雙頰一陣陣發熱！</p>

<h3>Northeast Ceasefire Agreement Signed; Effective Until the 22nd of This Month; Personnel Designated for Changchun Executive Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Today is the ninth day after the announcement of the Northeast ceasefire order, with only six days remaining until the ceasefire deadline. Yesterday, the specific measures for the Northeast ceasefire, drafted by Envoy Marshall and government representatives with the CCP representatives regarding the first item of Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order instructions, and the agreed-upon document "based on the three agreements on the Northeast ceasefire deliberated by the Military Tripartite Committee in Chongqing on March 23rd," were reviewed by General Beall at 11 p.m. last night after presenting it to Chairman Chiang. This afternoon, Envoy Marshall, government representative Xu Yongchang, and CCP representative Zhou Enlai re-signed the agreement one by one, after which the agreement was declared complete.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The organization of the Changchun Forward Headquarters of the Military Mediation Executive Department and the specific measures for the Northeast ceasefire were determined at noon today by the Military Tripartite Committee Marshall, Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, government representative General Cai Shoulien, and CCP representative General Rao Shushi. It is reported that General Beall is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 16th with Major General Li Minran, deputy leader of the CCP's Shenyang Central Group, and Major General Wang Shoudao of the 27th Group, for work. It is reported that Li and Wang visited Envoy Marshall at 9:30 this morning and had discussions with General Beall.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] It is reported that there are currently four groups in the Northeast Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department. After the establishment of the Changchun Forward Headquarters, there may be an increase of seven or eight groups. Government representatives for these groups are currently being selected and dispatched by the Ministry of National Defense. CCP representatives will be selected and dispatched from Yan'an. The overall situation has indeed revealed a ray of dawn in a state of contradiction. This morning at 11 a.m., Colonel Hill, chief of the Traffic Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, visited Zhou Enlai at Plum Garden New Village to exchange views on the restoration of traffic. According to the CCP's own statement, they have obtained a close proposal. Huang Yifeng, the CCP representative of the Traffic Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, also arrived in Nanjing by plane from Beiping at 3 p.m. today. Mr. Huang was summoned by Zhou Enlai to come to Nanjing to participate in traffic negotiations. It is reported that Minister of Communications Yu Dawei has formulated an entire plan for the restoration of traffic based on the chairman's instructions and the conclusions of previous meetings with Envoy Marshall and Zhou Enlai, Colonel Hill, etc. Once all parties' opinions converge, formal negotiations will be held within days to make a final decision. If the CCP genuinely intends to restore traffic and no accidents occur, this agreement can be completed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Today, General Marshall seems likely to seize a good opportunity to achieve agreements on a ceasefire, restoration of traffic, and reorganization of troops before the ceasefire deadline on the 15th. However, most observers express extreme pessimism about a long-term solution. Reliable sources here say that after lengthy talks between Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Yu Dawei, an agreement has now been reached between the KMT and the CCP on the traffic issue.</p>
<p>However, with only seven days remaining until the ceasefire deadline, many urgent issues remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Nanjing New Citizen Evening News on the 15th carried a news item stating that both parties had signed the Northeast ceasefire measures and that Chairman Chiang had personally signed the news. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Chairman Chiang's attendant secretary, who said: The Chairman did not sign any documents of this agreement. According to what I (the secretary referring to himself) know, General Beall visited the Chairman the night before last and presented a proposal to add to the Northeast Executive Group to conduct mediation. The Chairman stated that since the Communist army had long occupied Siping Street, Changchun, and other places, the March 27th agreement had been completely destroyed by them. However, the Chairman, in view of the enthusiasm of the United States for mediation, and in order to achieve peace as soon as possible, as long as there are detailed and effective ceasefire measures by June 22nd, he would not object to this proposal. However, the validity of this agreement can only be limited to the 22nd of this month, it was said. It was also heard that, regarding this point, Minister Xu also made a special statement when signing the agreement, so the report in the newspaper is inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] According to the U.S. proposal, if negotiations are successful in the future, the Military Mediation Department will send at least eight groups to the Northeast. These groups may be stationed in Harbin, Qiqihar, Hailar, and Haicheng. It is also reported that Marshall, Xu Yongchang, and Zhou Enlai will soon go to Shenyang.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Active in the Songhua River Area; Taking Advantage of the Ceasefire to Continuously Launch Attacks; National Army Asks the Executive Department to Swiftly Stop Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] A unit of the 21st Brigade of the 7th Column of the Communist Army's Jireliao Field Military Region attacked the bridgehead positions on the north bank of the Songhua River defended by the National Army at 9 a.m. on the 11th, destroying two lines of obstacles. The National Army defending the area was forced to resist, resulting in fierce fighting. By the hour of Chou (1-3 am) on the 12th, the Communist army retreated northeast. However, at daybreak on the same day, it again launched a full-scale attack on the National Army from the west side of the railway, all of which failed. Since the morning of the 13th, they have retreated towards Taolaizhao. Yesterday, about 20-odd Communist soldiers arrived from Shulan at Ma'anshan, more than 20 kilometers north of Lafa, and then scurried through Guangcen, more than 10 kilometers southwest of that location, to build fortifications. Furthermore, the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Communist Army stationed in Lafa, namely the 22nd Brigade, are still entrenched in the Bohe area. The Communist Army is taking advantage of the ceasefire opportunity, breaking faith, and attacking the National Army. The military authorities have telegraphed the Executive Department to swiftly stop them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] A reporter went to the front line of the Songhua River on the 9th to inspect and visited General Pan Yukun, commander of the forward garrison. According to Mr. Pan, before the ceasefire order was issued, the National Army had advanced to Taolaizhao, 17 li (Chinese miles) north of the Songhua River, and to Wujiazhan, 50 li west of Taolaizhao, and Wukeshu, 40 li east of Taolaizhao. After receiving the ceasefire order at 9 a.m. on the 7th, they immediately stopped the pursuit as ordered. Unexpectedly, three hours after the ceasefire order took effect, at 3 p.m. on the 7th, 700-800 Communist soldiers attacked Wukeshu. At 9 p.m. on the same day, another force of about 1,000 attacked Taolaizhao and Wujiazhan. On the 8th, a Communist unit, including 300 cavalry, attacked Halaha, failing and retreating. At 11 p.m. on the 10th, Communist soldiers, carrying artillery and more than a dozen light and heavy machine guns, attacked Xiaochengzi, 8 li from the Songhua River, and were immediately repelled by our defending troops. According to information obtained on the 10th, the Communist Army is currently massing forces towards Wangjiazhi, attempting to cross the river and launch an attack.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Returns to Changchun; Inspects Xiaofengman Power Plant Before Departure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yongji, 15th] Chief Du Yuming, Chairman Liang Huasheng, and Commander Liao Yaoxiang attended a citizens' rally held at Beishan Square here at 10 a.m. on the 15th, with more than 40,000 citizens attending. At 1 p.m., Chief Du and others went to inspect the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station, 25 kilometers southwest of Yongji. In order to commend the employees of the station for protecting the equipment, Chief Du specially allocated 200,000 in circulating vouchers. At 4 p.m., they arrived at Yongji from Xiaofengman and transferred to a special train at the station at 4:50 p.m. to return to Changchun. Commander Liao and others accompanied him.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] The citizens of Changchun held a grand rally at Zhongshan Park at 10 a.m. on the 13th to welcome Chief Du, with more than 50,000 people from all walks of life attending. After Chairman Liang delivered a brief opening speech, Mr. Du delivered a speech on the spot. He first explained Chairman Chiang's concern for the compatriots of the Northeast since the September 18th Incident. Although Chairman Chiang had made a trip to Changchun before, he was unable to meet with many compatriots, so this time he specially represented Chairman Chiang to come here to express his condolences. He then explained the importance of national unity and construction, and finally elaborated on the protection of foreigners and the "army loves the people, and the people help the army" aspects. Subsequently, Feng Changzeng, a representative of the citizens, delivered a welcome speech, expressing a warm welcome to Chief Du's arrival in Changchun, and praising and thanking Commander Yu Enxin of the 10th Air Force District for his achievements in Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Chief Du Yuming and Commander Liao Yaoxiang returned here by special train from Yongji at 8:30 p.m. this afternoon. Chief Du may fly back to Shenyang tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Building a Road from Botou to Yantai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Transportation sources report that the Communist Army is building a road eastward from Botou Town on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, passing through Chenzikou and heading straight to Yantai. Also, from Zhangjiakou, crossing the border between Hebei and Chahar to Tang County in central Hebei, the Communist Army is also building a road and preparing to build a road across the central Hebei Plain to connect with Shandong, connecting a long-distance export route starting from Zhangjiakou.</p>
<h3>Premier Song of the Executive Yuan to Inspect Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] Financial sources report that Premier Song of the Executive Yuan will come north within days to inspect the Northeast takeover situation in Shenyang and supervise the rapid resumption of work in various factories. A part of his entourage has already gone to Shenyang in advance.</p>
<h3>Defending the Land and Protecting the People is a Duty Inescapable; Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Releases a Statement Yesterday; The Government Hopes to Resolve Everything Within Fifteen Days</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department recently released the following statement: The government earnestly hopes to resolve the most pressing issues within the fifteen-day period, while the Communist side wants to discuss the traffic issue first, and then the issue of reorganizing and integrating the armed forces. If this is delayed, then these urgent problems will not be effectively resolved within the prescribed period. It is hoped that the Communist side will pay attention to the fact that the Communist side has launched widespread attacks in the past week, but the Communist side has propagandized that it has been attacked by government troops and is acting in self-defense. This is putting the cart before the horse in propaganda. May I ask, if the Communist side did not attack, how could important cities and towns such as Dezhou, Taian, Zhoucun, Jiaoxian, Zaozhuang, and Hanzhuang have been occupied by the Communist side? If the Communist side cannot withdraw from these cities and towns occupied after June 7th, then is it not obvious that they have torn up the ceasefire agreement? Someone asked why the government dispatched fleets to Qingdao one after another. We can tell you that the Communist army has recently besieged various places near Qingdao and repeatedly attempted to land without success. The government has the responsibility to defend the land, protect the people, and maintain law and order, so it cannot just sit idly by.</p>
<h3>Traffic on Four Railways, Including Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, and Beiping-Hankou, is Being Restored; The Entire Shenyang-Changchun Section Will Open Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] According to sources familiar with the matter, the Ministry of Communications has begun preparations to restore traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, Beiping-Hankou, and Longhai Railways. It is expected that the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways can be repaired within a month and a half. However, traffic restoration must be preceded by a ceasefire, and a ceasefire must be preceded by troop withdrawal. Based on the current negotiation process, people who generally care about the traffic issue all confirm that quickly determining the Communist army's defense zone to solve the two major problems of "ceasefire" and "troop withdrawal" is a prerequisite for restoring traffic. It is understood that Envoy Marshall is recently using his extraordinary wisdom to work on this and will soon submit it for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The emergency repair work on the Shenyang-Changchun section of the China Changchun Railway has been completed. A trial run from Siping to Changchun was conducted today, and the situation was good. It was decided to resume full traffic on the entire Shenyang-Changchun section at 7:30 a.m. on the 16th. Furthermore, the section from Shenyang Dashiqiao to Yingkou on the same route has also been repaired and opened to traffic yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 14th] Half a month after the Northeast ceasefire order was issued, railway traffic continued to be destroyed by the Communist army. More than 400 Communist soldiers at the Tuzitou Station, 10 li from the Jin-Yu section of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway, attacked the escort team at 2 a.m. on the 13th and were repelled around 4 a.m. In the Yaoguantun-Xingji section of the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, seven rails were destroyed by landmines planted by the Communist army at 2 a.m. on the 13th. After the Railway Bureau sent a team to repair it, it was repaired at 8:15 a.m. on the same day.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Qingdao Turns Mild; Government Sends Ships to Standby</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The tense situation in Qingdao and Jinan, which came on fiercely and left in a hurry, has eased due to the result of U.S. Admiral Kirk coming to Beijing to ask Envoy Marshall for instructions and the CCP repeatedly issuing statements that they do not intend to attack Qingdao and Jinan. According to those who came to Beijing from Shandong yesterday and today, the sea off Qingdao is indeed calm, but Jinan is still heavily surrounded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th] Qingdao was safe and sound on the 14th night and the 15th day. However, there is still fighting in the Xiaozhuang Yongyuan area of the suburbs. The fighting in Jimmo Gaoning is particularly fierce. Land transportation between Qingdao City and outside counties is cut off. Mayor Li Xianliang drove to Xiaozhuang to inspect on the afternoon of the 15th. In the afternoon of the 15th (Saturday), the U.S. military took its usual holiday, and the 24 U.S. cinemas were open. Merchants from Shanghai and other places were massively selling off their stocks, and prices of various goods fell, and grain prices also eased.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei, when issuing a statement today on the government's policy towards the serious situation in Shandong Province, said: We are now dispatching naval vessels to Qingdao under the threat of the Communist army, because the government cannot sit idly by. Dispatching ships is fulfilling the government's obligation to maintain domestic stability and order. Mr. Peng also said: If the Communist army does not withdraw from the cities it has occupied since June 7, [then they have obviously torn the ceasefire agreement to shreds.]</p>
<p>[Our News] The Navy's Office of the Special Commissioner stationed in Shanghai is being reorganized and a Fleet Command is being established since the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense. The commander is concurrently held by Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and Wei Jimin is the Chief of Staff. Currently, due to the tense situation in Qingdao and the Communist army's attempt to land from the sea, the Command has dispatched the Changzhi, Yongde, Xianning and other ships to stand by, and Wei has also gone to Qingdao to inspect a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi's Statement; Probably Has Another Purpose</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Chen Yi issued a statement yesterday and telegraphed the Military Mediation Department at the same time, saying that he welcomed the government to send personnel to Linyi to discuss and resolve the Shandong issue. Responsible persons on the government side today said that Chen Yi's move is a conspiracy, and its intention is to create a fait accompli and seek compromise with a superior position, so negotiation is possible, but the Communist army must first withdraw from the cities it has recently occupied, otherwise there is no need to discuss.</p>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 15th] Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, today asked the government not to use Qingdao to transport National Army troops to the Northeast and guaranteed that he would not attack Qingdao. Mr. Chen held talks with U.S. military officers at his battlefield headquarters on Wednesday, during which he firmly denied that his troops intended to attack Qingdao and declared: The Communist army's activities in various towns near Qingdao are to deal with puppet troops. Mr. Chen sent separate letters to Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and Clement, commander of the U.S. forces in Qingdao, stating: He was very concerned about the rumors that the National Army's 4th and 53rd Armies were about to leave Shanghai for Qingdao and then to the Northeast, and he intended to ask the U.S. military to prevent it on their behalf. The talk of the Communist army attacking Qingdao has gradually subsided today. Hao Ding, a representative of the Communist Party, and Larson, a representative of Kirk, flew from Qingdao to Linyi on a small reconnaissance plane to meet with Chen Yi. After a seven-hour meeting, they returned to Qingdao. Chen Yi put forward three suggestions, namely: (1) The National Army guarantees not to use Qingdao, (2) A dispatch of an executive team to Qingdao to deal with small-scale conflicts in the surrounding area, and (3) Welcome U.S. technicians and capital to develop various coal mines in the Shandong occupied area. Hao left Qingdao for Nanjing this morning to report the suggestions to Zhou Enlai, or Zhou will relay them to Envoy Marshall.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Chinese Military Joint Defense of Qingdao; U.S. Claims There Is No Such Thing</h3>
<p>[Our News] According to the U.S. naval authorities here, they told reporters yesterday: The Communist army has had no impact on the U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao so far, and the naval dynamics in Qingdao are as usual. Rumors of a serious situation are actually fallacies. Regarding the joint defense between the central army and the U.S. Navy, it also said that there is no such thing. It is also learned that Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, will move to Qingdao with his staff this month, but the exact departure date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Admiral Kirk, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy in China, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday: Regarding the actions of the Communist army attacking Qingdao, the countermeasures taken by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao cannot be clearly stated, but the U.S. military has its own policies. When the reporter asked about the strength of the U.S. Navy in Qingdao, Admiral Kirk said: The strength is increased or decreased at any time to adapt to the environment.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Fiercely Attacks Outlying Strongholds; Jinan Is Still Surrounded; Fierce Fighting in Yancheng and Changqing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th Dispatch] The Lu Communist Army is taking advantage of the ceasefire opportunity to relentlessly pressure the National Army.

Byrnes said: China has requested the US to send a military delegation to China, the nature of which would be the same as the military delegations sent to Latin America by the US. This bill authorizing military assistance to China was jointly drafted by the Departments of the Army and Navy and the State Department. I firmly believe that the interests of the nation (including its interests in the reconstruction and protection of peace and security in Asia) require the United States to assist China in organizing and maintaining a considerable amount of modern military force, so that China can contribute to peace and security in that region.</p>

<h3>22 Military Traitors in Beiping Have Been Investigated by the Provisional Headquarters; Lu Ying, Former Head of Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 15th] The 22 military traitors Wen Kai, Huang Haipeng, Ying etc. arrested by the Beiping Provisional Headquarters have been actively interrogated by the military law department of the Provisional Headquarters, and the investigation has been completed today. After two more weeks of investigating evidence of crimes, a public trial will begin. Also, nearly 200 Japanese war criminals have been arrested by the Eleventh War Zone, among whom the more important ones include Lieutenant General Uchida, who was a division commander and formerly stationed in Tianjin, and Colonel Mochikawa, who specialized in intelligence. Former Supreme Commander of the North China Dispatch Army, General Neiji Okamura, is still sitting securely within the Liaison Headquarters. Although he is a core member of the Japanese control faction and one of the main plotters of aggression against China, it has not been heard that he has been listed as a war criminal.

<h3>Suzhou High Court Prosecutor Investigates Rice Hoarders Zhang Weiru and Hong Junxiang for Providing Grain to the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 15th] Suzhou rice hoarders Zhang Weiru and Hong Junxiang illegally used the huge sum of money allocated by Wu Rongsheng of the Shanghai San Tai Rice Mill to absorb more than 5,000 dan of rice at high prices within three days. As a result, the price of rice in the market jumped from more than 10,000 yuan to more than 36,000 yuan. After Sheng Zhixing, a candidate senator of the Provisional Council, reported the matter to the Provisional Council, and a unanimous attack from the press, the Suzhou authorities decided to thoroughly investigate the matter. Later, a document from the Special Commissioner's Office for Grain Administration stationed in Shanghai provided support, and the matter subsided invisibly. The price of rice continued to break through 60,000, approaching the 70,000 yuan mark. Senator Sheng Zhixing, believing that Zhang and Hong had served in the puppet Rice Control Association during the enemy puppet era and searched for military grain for the enemy, an obvious track record, filed a lawsuit with the Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason.

<h3>Editorial: Severely Punish Corrupt Officials and Rice Weevils</h3>
<p>The grain loan fraud case has now become a major case that has attracted widespread attention! It is not because of the large amount of corruption involved in the case. To be honest, ten billion yuan is not a huge sum of money from today's currency value. Calculated at five thousand times the price, it is only two hundred thousand yuan. Even if it is all embezzled, it does not seem to be a major corruption case before the war. The reason why the grain loan case is receiving unanimous attention from both the government and the public today is due to three major reasons: (1) Rice prices have risen alarmingly. The government implemented grain loans to suppress rice prices, but there are still corrupt officials and rice weevils who take advantage of this opportunity to engage in fraud and enrich themselves. This is truly insane. (2) Cracking down on hoarding and sanctioning speculation have long been the consensus of society and the decision of the government. However, some people still want to take advantage of the low-interest public funds to fulfill their dreams of hoarding and speculation on "people's food." How can they not be condemned by everyone? (3) The National Government has repeatedly emphasized the severe punishment of corrupt officials, but since the victory, rumors of corruption have spread. Now that this undeniable major case has been discovered, people want to see what measures the government will take to show its determination to eliminate corruption.</p>
<p>Good! Now there is hope! When this major case first occurred, we knew that the central authorities had dispatched special agents to Shanghai to investigate secretly. Later, Cheng Zhonghang, the Jiangsu Inspector, officially filed charges and announced the investigation results. The court has also scheduled a public hearing. According to the Central News Agency, the main culprit in the case was already under close surveillance the night before Da Ren, and the Garrison Headquarters also received a hand-written order from the highest authorities to strictly investigate the case. Focusing on the case, we believe that the results of the investigation and interrogation will definitely reveal the truth. No matter how corrupt the officials or treacherous the weevils, they should not be able to escape the law.</p>
<p>However, what makes us particularly saddened and indignant about the grain loan fraud case is, as Inspector Cheng said, "directly harming people's livelihood and indirectly undermining the government's credibility." It cannot be compared to ordinary corruption cases. According to the facts listed in the indictment published by the Inspector's Office in the newspapers, the following points are summarized: (1) There are no restrictions on the commercial firms applying for grain loans. Officials and merchants collude and cheat each other, and most of them are pre-arranged by the Grain Administration Office. (2) After the "grain merchants" obtain the loans, some do not immediately go to the production areas to purchase grain, but instead lend them out at high interest rates and reap the benefits. Some do not immediately sell the grain after purchasing it, attempting to hoard and speculate. Some divert the proceeds from the sale of grain to other uses. The Grain Administration Office has failed to fulfill its supervisory and assessment responsibilities for these situations. (3) In late April, rice prices soared. The Grain Administration Office, citing market disputes, ordered the suspension of sales of grain loan rice for as long as ten days, causing rice prices to rise sharply. (4) The Grain Administration Office has cleverly created the item of "review fee," but there is no such provision in the loan measures approved by the Ministry of Food. (5) When the loan was approved, public opinion strongly criticized it, but the Grain Administration Office turned a deaf ear. "What are they relying on to be so fearless, and who is the mastermind behind them?"</p>
<p>From the five points mentioned above, the reason why the grain loan fraud case should be investigated is entirely due to "fraud" and not due to "grain loans." Recently, a viewpoint has suddenly emerged that the grain loan case is wrong in policy, not in technique. Its intention is nothing more than to say "there should not be grain loans," as if there would be no fraud without grain loans. All the blame should be borne by those who approved the grain loan policy. This is truly "ingenious speech"! Because of the high price of rice in Shanghai, everyone said that there was little rice in storage, high interest rates, and high costs, so they requested low-interest grain loans. At that time, did anyone object? Moreover, if the government did not approve the loan and the price of rice continued to rise, everyone would have accused the government. So what is wrong with the government allocating funds for grain loans! To be fair, "grain loans" are not guilty, but those who "fraudulently" handle grain loans are indeed guilty. Therefore, what the government is investigating today is the crime of those who handle grain loans and have fraudulent "techniques." If there is anything wrong with the grain loan case, it is wrong with this fraudulent "technique"!</p>
<p>Secondly, the rice weevils in this case are rumored to be of different sizes, and there are also merchants mixed in. "It is gratifying to expose both foxes and jackals", but for the sake of rectifying the discipline, it is better to kill jackals than to kill foxes, and it is better to punish corrupt officials than to punish treacherous merchants! Because killing foxes and letting go of jackals, and punishing treacherous merchants and acquitting corrupt officials, this method is still following the old path of "officials protecting each other." As a result, "those who steal a country become princes, and those who steal a hook are executed." It is not only insufficient to punish one as a warning to a hundred, but it may also cause public resentment. We dare to say one more honest word: if there were no corrupt officials, even if treacherous merchants wanted to be "treacherous," they would have no way to sell their "schemes." The ancients have long said: "The failure of the state is due to corrupt officials; the loss of virtue of officials is due to bribery." Inspector Cheng also said: "If you want to eradicate treacherous merchants, you must first eliminate corrupt officials." This is an irrefutable saying. Moreover, we believe that to punish corrupt officials, we must first punish the big corrupt officials who preside over the fraud. Inspector Cheng is also well aware of this. The only pity is that in his indictment, he only said "who is the mastermind behind them?" Although it seems to be on the verge of being revealed, it is ultimately hesitant. People have always believed that the Inspectorate can only "swat flies" when it comes to indicting corrupt officials, but they remain silent on high-ranking officials. However, in almost every case of embezzlement and fraud, there is a mastermind behind it. As a result, it is often the "one and a half official" small officials who suffer, while high-ranking officials remain at large. Therefore, officials should not be afraid of power and should not avoid risks, and should try to file charges as much as possible, especially against these masterminds. Only by severely punishing those in power who commit fraud can we truly punish one as a warning to a hundred. Taking this case as an example, not to mention the mastermind behind the scenes, Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the Grain Administration Office who was charged, is already enjoying himself abroad. Moreover, after the Ministry of Food abolished the Grain Administration Office and established the Storage and Transportation Office, Yang Xizhi still had to be appointed as the director and deputy director in Da Ren. What else can be said!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 15th Broadcast: A few minutes ago (1:00 AM, Shanghai time, on the 16th), the four-power foreign ministers' meeting resumed. British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived first, and Molotov arrived late. They immediately started the meeting to discuss the agenda. The meeting is still in progress.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: Soviet representative Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin shook hands in the Luxembourg Hall, showing their goodwill. It can be seen that there is still hope for compromise in the future for the four foreign ministers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union gathered here today. At that time, the US side sent out the news that the US and the Soviet Union had a firm attitude towards the dispute over the treaty, which was no different from the situation at the last meeting a month ago. US Secretary of State Byrnes arrived first on President Truman's private plane. Shortly thereafter, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov (accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and Deganosov) also arrived in succession. According to Byrnes's aides, since the adjournment of the meeting in May, the US and Soviet governments have not exchanged opinions diplomatically. If the Soviet attitude has eased, it will be known at the meeting. After Byrnes entertained reporters here tonight, the general impression was that Byrnes was still optimistic, but there was no factual basis for whether a considerable agreement could be reached on the major disputes between the Soviet Union and Western countries on the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the Netherlands. The US still insists that Trieste should belong to Italy, and the Balkan countries should be open to trade with Western countries. The Italian reparations should be limited to what it can afford. The US still wants to sign a 25-year mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, Britain, and France to jointly monitor the disarmament of Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Before leaving for France, Bevin smiled at the airport and said: I have always had hope for the foreign ministers' meeting. God is the master of all things. I hope God will be more merciful this time.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] After arriving in Paris today, Byrnes said: I am very happy to come back again. Connally also told reporters that he was very optimistic. The US delegation immediately started work, giving the impression that they would spare no effort. In reality, the atmosphere of this foreign ministers' meeting is more favorable than the last time. President Truman's special plane [Sacred Cow] on which the US delegation was riding has flown back to the United States.</p>
<h3>The Division and Unity of the World All Depend on This Meeting</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, San Francisco, 14th] Before the opening of the foreign ministers' meeting, American newspapers published editorials one after another, discussing and commenting on it. The New York Times emphasized the importance of the Paris peace talks yesterday, stating briefly: "During the war and in the turbulent first year of peace, meetings of foreign ministers and heads of state have been held many times, each of which was important in nature, but none was as important as the upcoming Paris meeting. The Paris meeting will determine whether the outcome of the war will be one world or two worlds." The newspaper's editorial writer mentioned Secretary of State Byrnes's plan to divide the administration of Germany, saying: "The meeting that will reopen on June 15th has the hope of restoring the wartime cooperation policy of the Allies. Otherwise, the relations between the major powers will become increasingly tense, and there will be a tendency to accelerate the division of the world into two."</p>
<h3>The Fate of the Potsdam Agreement Can Be Decided</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] When the foreign ministers' meeting reopens, the fate of the Potsdam Agreement can be seen. According to international sources, the British and American delegations believe that if certain matters in the Potsdam Agreement, which they consider to be major points, cannot be implemented, then the entire agreement should be considered invalid. If so, then the decisions made by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union regarding the eastern border of Germany will no longer be respected.</p>
<h3>German-American and Soviet Occupation Zones Sign Agreement to Exchange Products, British Occupation Zone Takes Over German Private Farmland, and Allows Allied Reporters to Enter and Investigate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 14th] It was learned tonight that the authorities of the American and Soviet occupation zones have reached an agreement stipulating that they will exchange products worth 100 million marks each quarter. Although this agreement is only an expedient measure to promote the economic unification of Germany, it is a further step than the previous trade agreement with the Soviet occupation zone, because the previous exchange of products was only worth 19 million marks. The US authorities especially praised the establishment of a permanent joint committee for German administration, whose task is to implement the product exchange agreement and promote trade in the US and Soviet occupation zones. It is reported that the Soviet occupation zone will exchange rubber, film, X-ray balls, electric automobiles, etc. for tires, pipes, dyes, graphite, steel, generators, etc. in the American occupation zone.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] British Deputy Military Governor of the occupation zone, Major General Robertson, announced that Britain has decided to immediately take over privately owned farmland with an area of more than 500 hectares in the zone. This is a transitional measure taken by the military government before receiving and reviewing the land reform report, which is being prepared by an advisory committee.</p>
<p>Robertson also said that the German British occupation zone is now open for investigation by Allied reporters, but the convenience for Russians is limited to the scope permitted by the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Herford, 14th] It is reported that the British member headquarters of the Allied Control Commission will move to Hamburg. It is expected that it will not be completed until the autumn of next year.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union and Afghanistan Sign Border Agreement, Britain Expresses Non-Interference</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson announced today that the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan to revise the border between the two countries concerns the sovereignty of the two independent countries and has nothing to do with Britain. The agreement stipulates that the Kushki Mountains region will be ceded to the Soviet Union, and the British Foreign Office does not comment.</p>
<h3>Although Labor and Management Have Signed an Agreement, Most American Seamen Are on Strike, Demanding Revision of Wage Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: American seamen and dockworkers leaders have now accepted the government's wage adjustment plan, but because the news was released too late, 200,000 workers in eastern coastal cities such as New York and Boston have successively started strikes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: The American seamen who have gone on strike have not yet returned to work. They are dissatisfied with the agreement reached between the government and the labor unions and demand that it be revised.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] 275,000 national seamen and dockworkers were originally scheduled to strike at midnight today. The US Navy has prepared to take over the shipping to avoid transportation disruptions. However, three and a half hours before the scheduled strike time, labor and management, through government mediation, finally signed an agreement at 8:28 PM to resolve wage and service time issues, and a major crisis was thus avoided. This labor unrest involved five labor unions. If it were implemented, 3,100 American ships would be out of service, which would be a major blow to the United States after the war, and the whole world would be affected.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Plymouth, 14th] The Labour Party annual conference closed at 1:00 PM today.

The debate on colonial policy began with Professor Catlin's proposal of a resolution demanding the rejection of the previous claim by the Churchill government that "the Atlantic Charter does not apply to nations east of the Suez Canal, and at the same time demanding the formulation of an Asian Charter." Minister Greenwood said that the Labour Party Executive Committee agreed with the content of the resolution, but did not give a speech in support of the resolution.

<h3>UN Atomic Energy Commission Meeting; US Representative Proposes Establishing an International Organization; Atomic Bombs Banned in Warfare; Decide on Appropriate Control System</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 14th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a brief meeting today to decide on organizational matters. As a matter of customary procedure, the presidency of the meeting was to be rotated among member states in alphabetical order. Therefore, after US representative Baruch served as temporary chairman, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will serve as chairman for the first month. The committee then adjourned until June 19, and the representatives of various countries will immediately inform their governments of the full text of the US proposal.</p>
<p>The US representative read President Truman's telegram to the committee, which stated: "Please convey to the representatives of all countries that I deeply feel that the work they are engaged in is of great significance and unparalleled. The success or failure of this matter is related to the fate of the entire world. On behalf of all Americans, I wish you a smooth journey."</p>
<p>During today's meeting, Baruch's warning was: "World peace or world destruction rests solely with this committee."</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] At the first meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission today, US representative Baruch proposed the establishment of an international atomic energy development organization. If there is an appropriate management system, he is willing to destroy all atomic bombs and stop manufacturing them. This proposal has a significant impact amidst the renewed meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris. Baruch's proposal became a special document in the UN organization, stating that the United States will insist that no part of this organization for the development and peaceful application of atomic energy shall have veto power.</p>
<p>Proposal Content</p>
<p>The US proposal advocates banning the use of atomic bombs in warfare. The world and the entire organization should not only hold pious thoughts, but must have enforceable sanctions and "teeth" in international law as its backing. Punishing those who violate international faith should be the core of today's security system. If an appropriate system for managing atomic energy can be agreed upon and implemented, the United States is willing to make the following recommendations: (1) Stop manufacturing atomic bombs; (2) Dispose of existing atomic bombs in accordance with treaty provisions; (3) The international atomic organization should receive detailed reports on atomic energy production.</p>
<p>The international atomic organization should start with raw materials and take the following measures: (1) Various atomic energy activities that pose a danger to world security should be managed and controlled by the international organization; (2) For all other atomic energy activities, the international organization has the authority to manage, inspect, and issue licenses; (3) The international organization has the obligation to promote the use of atomic energy for beneficial purposes; (4) The international organization has the active responsibility to research and develop atomic energy so that it is in an advanced position in atomic knowledge, and thus can understand and detect the misuse of atomic energy. All countries should draft the most severe penalties for the following violations of the international management organization: (1) Hiding or using atomic bombs privately; (2) Hiding or using raw materials suitable for making atomic bombs privately; (3) Seizing any factories or property belonging to the international organization or licensed; (4) Arbitrarily interfering with the activities of the international organization; (5) Violating or resisting the licenses approved by the international management organization, creating or operating dangerous plans. (The following is a US News Agency dispatch.)</p>
<p>Basic Essentials</p>
<p>Baruch also proposed the following measures to represent the basic essentials of a comprehensive plan: (1) The management organization should formulate a comprehensive plan for the control of atomic energy; (2) The primary purpose of the management organization should be to obtain and maintain complete and accurate information on the world's supply of uranium and thorium, and thereby control it; (3) The management organization should implement full control over the production of fissionable materials; (4) The management organization should have the sole and absolute authority to direct research within the scope of atomic explosives; (5) All activities that are inherently dangerous to security and completely entrusted to the management organization should be distributed throughout the world, while raw materials and fissionable materials should not be concentrated in one place; (6) Part of the work of the management organization is to promote the peaceful benefits of atomic energy; (7) Problems should be continuously reviewed, and the dividing lines between dangerous and non-dangerous activities should be revised; (8) All factories that operate uranium and thorium should be regulated by the management organization; (9) All activities that are inherently dangerous should be completely entrusted to the management organization to reduce the difficulty of inspection; (10) All qualified representatives of the management organization must have guaranteed access; (11) The staff of the management organization should be employed based on merit, and as far as possible, without regard to nationality; (12) Once the charter of the management organization is adopted, it must be gradually implemented; (13) During the deliberations of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, the United States is prepared to provide the necessary information; (14) A purely national atomic energy development management organization should be subordinate to international atomic energy control. The committee should clearly define the scope of authority and responsibility for such national management organizations.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Has No Objections</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 14th] Soviet representative Gromyko declared: "The situation in the Atomic Energy Commission is proceeding smoothly. Baruch's speech was well-written and well-delivered. I have no opinion to express on its content." British representative Cadogan also said: "Baruch's speech was excellent and can be said to be just right." Australian representative Evatt said: The committee will meet next Wednesday, and various countries will successively submit replies. The Atomic Energy Commission is composed of all members of the Security Council, in addition to the eleven countries of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Australia, the Netherlands, Egypt, Brazil and Mexico, plus Canada. Although Canada is not a member of the Security Council, because it actively participated in the development of the atomic bomb with the United States and Britain, it was given a permanent seat on the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<h3>Curie's Suggestion: If a Co-Management Agreement Cannot be Established, Scientists Should Stop Research</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] Curie, the leader of the French delegation to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, suggested at an information conference here yesterday that if an international co-management agreement for atomic energy cannot be established, atomic energy scientists should immediately stop their research work.</p>
<h3>The Experiences and Colds of the Four Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>— Special Report by this Newspaper</p>
<p>The conference of the foreign ministers of the four countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, reopened in Paris yesterday. It is said that this conference will give a definite answer to the question of the division and integration of the world after the end of World War II. The importance of the meeting is evident.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, we would like to introduce to the readers the experiences and tendencies of the four foreign ministers. Perhaps it will be helpful to understand the development of the meeting.</p>
<p>Byrnes</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes has served as a member of both houses of Congress, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, and the director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. However, serving in a diplomatic position is a first for him. In August 1945, he accompanied President Truman to the Potsdam Conference, and in October of the same year, he attended the first foreign ministers' conference, where he became famous as a "peacemaker."</p>
<p>Byrnes was born in South Carolina and came from a poor background. His subsequent experiences have made his words rounded, gentle, and very skillful. In Congress, he understood that major bills cannot pass without compromise. Therefore, his meetings are aimed at bringing factions that are in deadlock closer to each other, making concessions to each other, and finally reaching an agreement from the disputes.</p>
<p>Byrnes believes that his experience can be applied in international negotiations as well. He believes that once the leaders of various countries gather together, as long as they compromise with each other in a courteous manner, the crux of the problem can be resolved without a doubt.</p>
<p>Molotov</p>
<p>Molotov is a diplomat with extensive experience. He is quick-witted, composed, and full of confidence. When he is silent, he seems to be a person without opinions, but when he speaks, he fully shows that he understands the cold and realistic world very clearly. He is perhaps Stalin's oldest and closest colleague. The two of them rose from the revolutionary movement together, and both are "old Bolsheviks." Molotov's implementation of Stalin's line is also one of the most serious.</p>
<p>Bevin</p>
<p>Bevin has little diplomatic experience, which is similar to Byrnes. He is stout, weighing 240 pounds. His reaching today's position is entirely due to his involvement in the trade union movement. His many years of struggle in the trade union have made him rise to become the leader of several important unions. He is known for his tenacity and uncompromising nature. He has not received a formal education in his life, but through hard self-study, he has a deep understanding of economics and history. During the war, he was the Minister of Labor in Churchill's cabinet and the commander-in-chief of British manpower mobilization. Last year's election results made Attlee the prime minister. He was eager to find a suitable person to accompany him to Potsdam to attend the summit meeting, and as a result, he chose Bevin. In British history, no foreign secretary has ever come from a working-class background like Bevin.</p>
<p>In addition to the above characteristics, Bevin also has his irritable temper and spicy cursing tone. At the London foreign ministers' conference and the recent Security Council meeting, he quarreled with Molotov and Vyshinsky, both blushing with anger.</p>
<p>Bidault</p>
<p>Bidault is a new official. He only became the foreign minister of France after the liberation. He was previously a history professor and journalist at the University of Paris. He was instrumental in leading the secret resistance organization during the French occupation. At forty-six years old this year, he is younger than the above three, and his diplomatic experience is not rich. The important international conferences he has attended are the San Francisco Conference, the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the First Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. He is now the leader of the Progressive Catholic Party.</p>
<h3>East Indies Army Continues Resistance; British and Dutch Issue Final Warning; Artillery Battles in Bekasi Frontline</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] London, 15th Broadcast: The British and Dutch authorities today issued a final warning to the Indonesian army: If the East Indies army continues military action, the British will deploy a large number of aircraft to carry out bombing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 14th] Allied Headquarters here announced that the linked activities on all lines of Java and Medan area of Sumatra have increased recently, and at the same time, the political atmosphere seems to be gradually tense. Indonesian sources pointed out that the Allied forces are gradually expanding the defense line around Batavia, which is an attempt to launch another attack. Recently, it was rumored that Indonesians have concentrated in the Surabaya area, and the Dutch army will take over Batavia, and the Indonesian army is preparing to counterattack. These rumors are difficult to grasp, but the sound of mortars and artillery in Bekasi is indeed clearly audible here.</p>

<h3>US Policy Remains Unchanged; Determined to Aid Jewish Immigration; Dispatching Officials to Britain for Consultation</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 14th] President Truman said at a press conference today that the United States is still striving to allow 100,000 Jews to enter Palestine. The President also said that the United States does not intend to change immigration laws to allow more Jews to enter the United States from Europe. The President declined to comment on Bevin's statement, because it is said that no formal notice has been received from the British side regarding this matter. At the same time, according to the State Department, two State Department officials and two Army officials set out for London yesterday to provide consultation to Ambassador Harriman in Britain when discussing the situation in Palestine with the British.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] In order to hold talks with the United States, the British government has selected officials from relevant departments to form a delegation, led by Bullock, to discuss various matters arising from the recommendations of the investigation committee. The British government will make a decision after the talks have yielded results.</p>
<p>Plan to Transfer 20,000 Jewish Children</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 14th] The Youth Immigration Association has drafted a plan to continue to transfer 20,000 Jewish children from Europe to Palestine. It is estimated that the cost of building reception centers and other facilities is US$10 million, and the annual reception fee is US$11 million.</p>
<h3>Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, Returns to Homeland; Arabs Prepare to Celebrate on a Large Scale</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 14th] Arabs here distributed leaflets today, requesting that celebrations be held on the 14th, 15th, and 16th to commemorate Husseini's safe return to his homeland.</p>
<h3>McNutt to be Appointed US Ambassador to the Philippines</h3>

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 14th] The Philippine government hopes that the United States Congress will immediately pass a bill so that the Philippines can acquire the Japanese hemp factories and other foreign assets in Mindanao, as the country has never declared war on Japan or other Axis powers. President Roxas announced today that an agreement has been reached with the US authorities regarding this matter.</p>

<h3>Falsely Conveying an Imperial Edict; Utterly Outrageous! Japanese Prosecutors Arrest People</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 15th] On the 15th of last month, starving people held an anti-imperial demonstration here. The slogans included a false imperial edict that satirized the comfort of the imperial family and the starvation of the common people. The original text stated: "The Imperial Edict says, the great principles of our country have been preserved, that is, we eat as much as we can, but you obedient people may as well starve, 御名御　(with imperial name and seal)."

The summonses were all issued yesterday.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office scheduled the summons for the food loan embezzlement case for tomorrow. The summons was sent to the Grain Administration four days ago, but Li Chongnian and Ren Xingyai are still in Nanjing. The Grain Administration was unable to give a definite answer yesterday whether they would be able to come to Shanghai to appear in court tomorrow. It only said that the summons had been forwarded to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Measures: Opinions Expressed by the Press, Mayor Discusses Rice, Public Food Supply Unworried, Yellow Publications Determined to be Banned</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Mayor Wu Guozhen held the second press conference in the municipal government conference room, reporting on municipal facilities and listening to opinions from the press. More than 40 people in charge of various newspapers and observers attended. Mayor Wu first reported on two points: (1) Regarding the grain issue, after the municipal government strived to dredge sources and investigated stockpiles, rice prices have gradually stabilized. If rice purchased from abroad can be continuously imported before the new grain is harvested, the food supply issue for the city can be reported to be worry-free. On this point, we hope that friendly nations will provide as much assistance as possible. (2) The municipal government has decided to ban general obscene and harmful to public morals yellow publications. Since they have not applied for registration according to law, the municipal government has the right to prohibit their publication and distribution. After the report, he raised the following issues: (1) Housing shortage, (2) Traffic order, (3) Vendor problems, (4) Economic crisis, and asked the attendees to express their opinions. A brief summary of each person's opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>Grain Issue</p>
<p>Zhu Baiying of Shangbao advocated: (1) The government should not excessively control the transportation and sales of grain to avoid affecting the import of rice and grain from outside the market. (2) Please ask the government to negotiate with friendly nations to facilitate our grain merchants to purchase food from grain producing families.</p>
<p>Housing Shortage</p>
<p>Wang Yun-sheng of Dagongbao, Zhou Chong of Zhonghua Shibao, Zhu Peiji of Qiaoshengbao, Zhu Baiying of Shangbao, Li Zikuan of Dagongbao, Cheng Cangbo of Xinwenbao, and Zhang Zhihan of Huamei Wanbao spoke one after another. The opinions of each person can be summarized as follows: (1) The allocation of received houses should strive to be reasonable, fair, and rapid. (2) Revise the building regulations to allow and encourage landowners and capable citizens to build houses. (3) Protect the property rights of owners and strictly prohibit second landlords, third tenants, and high-priced transfers. (4) Investigate the names of the agencies publishing housing advertisements in newspapers. (5) Investigate housing advertisements in newspapers, such as those offering top prices, and ban the bad habit of asking for gold bars for the top price. Cheng Cangbo specifically pointed out that the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has failed to allocate and handle the received houses fairly and reasonably for several months, and has not made a public report. He requested that the mayor invite Director Liu of the bureau to attend the next reception for the press to report on the process of handling the received houses. The audience applauded unanimously in agreement.</p>
<p>Yellow Publications</p>
<p>Wang Yun-sheng and Zhu Baiying expressed their opinions, which can be summarized as: (1) Pay attention to the yellow text in large newspapers. (2) If newspapers and publications contain records that harm a person's reputation, the victims should be encouraged to file a lawsuit according to law. (3) The supplements of each newspaper may as well slightly lower their level to meet the needs of general readers, but to the extent that they do not become "yellow."</p>
<p>Traffic Order</p>
<p>Wang Yun-sheng, Zhou Han, etc., respectively put forward the following opinions: (1) Restrict the driving of large trucks on main roads during the day. (2) Methods such as clearing trams and bus stations. (3) Plan to open underground traffic. (4) Designate parking locations for empty cars and prohibit parking anywhere on the roadside.</p>
<p>Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Wang Yun-sheng advocated: (1) Strive for fairness in the burden of donations and taxes. The rich should pay more. (2) Vigorously simplify tax collection procedures. (4) Reduce administrative expenses. Zhu Baiying believes that the biggest economic crisis at present is the excess of import over export in foreign trade. The main reason is that the government and the general public pay too much attention to the level of the exchange rate, while neglecting the application of the entire exchange policy. In fact, a too low exchange rate is indeed beneficial to imports, but not to exports, and it hinders the survival and development of the domestic industry. A too high exchange rate is not necessarily beneficial to the industry either, because a too high exchange rate will inevitably stimulate the soaring of prices and wages, and increase the prices of foreign raw materials and production tools that must be imported. Because the production costs of various factories increase greatly, the products still cannot compete with cheap foreign goods. If the government can flexibly use the exchange rate policy to facilitate the import of necessities and prohibit the import of non-essentials, then a slightly lower exchange rate will not cause the disadvantages of foreign goods dumping. He hopes that Mayor Wu will suggest that the central government consider adopting it.</p>
<h3>Mayor Reports Again: Advocates Credited Brown Rice</h3>
<p>After listening to everyone's opinions, Mayor Wu briefly reported on the above issues again: Regarding the grain issue, he intends to advocate the use of brown rice on credit by citizens, saying that experts have researched that brown rice contains far more vitamin B than polished rice. If the people of the whole country can all eat brown rice, not only can the amount of grain be increased by 10%, but it will also be beneficial to the health of the people. He has now ordered the Bean and Rice Industry Association and various rice mills in the city to mill rice according to the specified standards, and has telegraphed the central government to order the whole country to travel uniformly. Regarding the distribution of houses, it is decided to handle it according to the two principles of complete openness and thorough investigation. A part of the German community in the city will return to their country at the end of this month, and the houses they leave behind will also be allocated reasonably. Mayor Wu also reported that the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan was originally concurrently served as the Deputy Director of the committee by Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office. Later, after the Executive Yuan's office was abolished, Mr. Huang resigned from the post of Deputy Director of the Housing Allocation Committee. After I took office, because Mr. Huang was very familiar with the situation in Shanghai, I still asked him to continue to serve as the Deputy Director of the Housing Allocation Committee, and he agreed. After the report, the symposium adjourned in a very harmonious atmosphere.</p>

<h3>General Assembly of the Machinery Industry Association Advocates the "Love Our National Products" Campaign, Elects New Directors and Supervisors to Actively Promote It</h3>
<p>The 12th Members' Representative Assembly of the Shanghai Machinery Industry Association was held yesterday afternoon at the Central Western Restaurant, attended by Ping Peizeng, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Qian Naixin, a representative from Mayor Wu, Feng Guangjia, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 200 members. The presidium included Hu Xiyuan, Hu Boxiang, Xiang Jiwu, Wang Jiazhen, Tian Heqing, Hong Nianzu, Ren Bingdao, etc. First, Hu Xiyuan reported that the crisis faced by national product factories is even greater than during the war. If we want to overcome this crisis, we can only save it by implementing the joint efforts of national product factories, cooperation between industry and commerce, cooperation between labor and capital, and cooperation between officials and the people. Next, representatives from various agencies gave speeches, mostly encouraging. During the meeting, Hu Boxiang proposed to use the national product campaign to awaken the people to use national products as an honor, and not to specialize in selling foreign goods, which consumes huge amounts of foreign exchange, affects China's entire economy, and hinders the development of national industry. Later, Tian Heqing presided over the discussion of proposals, Hong Nianzu presided over the revision of the association's articles of association, and invited Luo Qinghua, Xu Zhaohou, Sun Daosheng, etc. to give speeches. Finally, China Ya Pu'er Electrical Appliance Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, etc. were elected as supervisors. The new board of directors and supervisors will soon be in office, and will unite with other groups to strengthen the promotion of the "Love Our National Products" campaign, which will make a significant contribution to the national product community.</p>
<h3>Cuban Overseas Chinese Suffers Oppression, Overseas Chinese Leader Zhu Jiazhao Returns Home to Consult and Negotiate, Hoping to Remedy the Situation When Concluding Commercial Treaties</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Zhu Jiazhao, a leader of the Cuban overseas Chinese community, recently came to Shanghai. A reporter from this newspaper made a special visit yesterday. Mr. Zhu stated that Cuba originally had 80,000 overseas Chinese, but now because the Cuban government absolutely prohibits Chinese from entering the country, the number has been reduced to more than 20,000. When Cuba became independent, the overseas Chinese had tried their best to assist and resist the Spanish government, the ruler of Cuba at the time. Therefore, the Cuban people and the overseas Chinese have always had close feelings. Unexpectedly, recently, the overseas Chinese have been subjected to oppression. Among the workers in factories, if there are 10 workers, the number of Chinese workers is not allowed to exceed 5. If a Chinese worker dies or cannot continue to work for other reasons, they must not be replaced by another Chinese. At present, the Cuban overseas Chinese are all over the age of 45. If the government does not provide relief, the Cuban overseas Chinese will disappear in 20 years! Mr. Zhu first consulted with Mr. Li Dijun, our country's minister to Cuba, about this matter before returning to China. After returning to China, he went to Beijing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and other places, requesting that the situation be remedied when concluding commercial treaties between China and Cuba. Mr. Zhu has lived in Cuba for more than 30 years and has served as the chairman of the Cuban China Anti-Japanese Support Association. He is particularly enthusiastic about organizing branches in various places. He first donated money to help General Ma Gushan and the 19th Route Army, and made great efforts to resist the war. Mr. Zhu said that Cuba still has a monument to commemorate the contributions of the overseas Chinese in assisting the founding of the country.</p>
<h3>Preventing Epidemics Is Like Preventing Fire: Large-Scale Publicity Begins Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal health authorities, in view of the fact that "preventing epidemics is like preventing fire," have been actively concentrating their efforts in recent days to eliminate black terror. For publicity work, cholera movies will be shown, epidemic prevention broadcasts will be given, leaflets will be distributed, and epidemic prevention knowledge will be discussed in various churches, starting today. According to reporters, there were 35 cholera patients yesterday, breaking the previous record. Together with the previous cases, there are 237 people in total, with 23 deaths.</p>
<h3>Jin Binshan Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Instruct on Epidemic Prevention Matters</h3>
<p>The current cholera epidemic in the city is rampant, and the municipal health bureau has been striving to prevent and control it. The US military authorities, the American Red Cross, various churches, the National Shanghai Medical College, the Chinese Red Cross, the Boy Scouts Council, and other groups have also enthusiastically assisted in epidemic prevention work. Director Jin Binshan of the Ministry of Health came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to give instructions to the Health Bureau on epidemic prevention matters in the city.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the UK, flew from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday and arrived at Longhua Airport at 4 PM. He stayed at the International Hotel and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for India tomorrow and return to his post via that route.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Ambassador to China, Ohr, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Ohr, the Norwegian Ambassador to China, and General MacArthur, the commander of the US forces stationed in the Philippines, arrived in Shanghai on the same plane from Manila yesterday and landed at Jiangwan Airport at 4:30 PM. Mayor Wu sent a representative to welcome them at the airport.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui's Health is Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the National Defense Supreme Committee, felt slightly unwell after arriving in Shanghai due to receiving many guests and overwork. After receiving medical treatment for several days, he has gradually recovered, but he still needs to recuperate for a few days before returning to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Resident Committee Member of the Provisional Council Suggests Strengthening Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>The resident committee of the Municipal Provisional Council held a meeting yesterday. Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau reported on the work of land consolidation. The General Assembly also suggested that the Municipal Government increase funding for epidemic prevention and add timely epidemic hospitals to prevent epidemics.</p>
<h3>Tendering for Enemy Property Factories: Sixth Batch of Sixteen</h3>
<p>The Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Area Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee passed (1) the list of the sixth batch of factories and equipment for tender, including 16 factories with recoverable value, including the first factory of Rili and Alcohol Beverage Co., Ltd., the Shanghai factory of Japan Leather Co., Ltd., Wanguo Chemical Dye Factory, Rihua Oxygen Industry Co., Ltd., Nanchang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., China Oil Refining Co., Ltd., the second factory of Jiangnan Paper Mill, the third factory of Jiangnan Paper Mill, Nails Needle Factory, Sanle Fountain Pen Factory, Dongya Tea Factory, Huagong Precision Factory, Fuchang Company Iron Factory, and the second factory of Shougong Iron Factory. (2) Seven units of equipment were nationalized, including Dali Company, Xinxing Company, Songhua Bottle Cap Factory, Dongbin Iron Factory, Zhongshan Foreign Company, Iwai Foreign Company Machine Factory, and Mitsubishi Foreign Company and other materials. In addition, the return of materials from Liming Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, Sassoon Foreign Company, Mueller Company, Jardine Matheson, and Wuhu Mingyuan Electric Company, Litong Shipping Bureau Yongan Ship, etc. was approved.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Shipyard: No Ships to Build, Shipyard Desolate, Steel Rusty, Only Dragon Bones Listen to the River</h3>
<p>"Our current work, in terms of our equipment and capabilities, can be said to be using a bull knife to kill a chicken!"</p>
<p>Ou De, Director of the Personnel Office of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy, said with a wry smile to the reporter.</p>
<p>Today, when the industrial community is generally encountering a bankruptcy crisis, the shipbuilding industry is also struggling to maintain itself in a near-suffocating and depressed situation. The Jiangnan Shipyard is the only shipbuilding industry in the country. Its predecessor was the Nantie Factory. It was only taken over from the enemy and puppets in August and September last year. The machinery and equipment were not damaged. Except for a small part that needs to be repaired, the rest is old, but it is still generally usable. Director Ma Deji is a veteran in the shipbuilding engineering industry. As early as 1944, Mr. Ma organized a "Shipbuilding Service Group" and led more than 20 young technicians across the ocean to serve in major shipyards in the United States. On the one hand, they represented the government to participate in the work of the United Nations, and on the other hand, they allowed his cadres to learn some practical shipbuilding experience. This service group gave the American people a very good impression. Especially after Mr. Ma and Victory, Jiangnan Shipyard was responsible for it, and actively contacted the American side for new machines and materials, preparing to greatly develop China's shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p>"But," Mr. Ou said with emotion, "materials, equipment, and talents are all available. The only trouble is that no customers come to the door. Shipbuilding is not like other industries, which can produce goods first and then wait for people to buy them. We have sufficient power to build large ships of 10,000 tons, 20,000 tons, or even 30,000 tons, but who is willing to inquire? Not to mention merchants, even the government only knows how to buy ready-made ships from foreign countries!" Why is that? Because it is much cheaper to buy from foreign countries than to build in China. Foreign ships do not need to pay taxes when imported, but the machines and materials used to build them are not given tax-free preferential treatment by the government. Coupled with the expensive freight and the wages and management costs affected by commercial prices, it is of course more cost-effective to buy ships directly from foreign countries.</p>
<p>Mr. Ou continued to tell the reporter that the current work of the shipyard is limited to repairs. Although the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation (行總) recently ordered some small wooden boats for transporting goods from the shipyard, it is not worth the engineering value at all. There are now more than 2,000 workers and more than 200 staff members, most of whom are technicians.</p>
<p>"We must maintain this group of technicians. Although the current treatment is very poor, I believe they will be used one day," Mr. Ou said firmly.</p>
<p>The reporter asked to see their shipyard and factory. He asked Engineer Yun Weixian, who had also participated in the "Shipbuilding Service Group" and returned from the United States not long ago, to lead the way.</p>
<p>Building Small Wooden Boats with a Bull Knife, all three shipyards were resting ships under repair. In the first shipyard, a ship of about several thousand tons was nearing completion, with newly painted paint shining brightly. In the second shipyard was a very small inland river ship. The third shipyard was the largest. A giant ship painted with patches of yellow anti-rust paint was parked there. A dozen workers were working separately. The ship was named "Onward" and was about 10,000 tons. It was a ship on the President Line. Mr. Yun said: It is very puzzling that the ships of our own government agencies sometimes do not come here for repairs when they are broken.</p>
<p>Past the shipyard was the construction yard. The tall steel frames seemed a little rusty. A red keel quietly lay there. The surrounding area was piled with materials for building small wooden boats for the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation. Several small boats had already been painted, and another batch of US landing craft were being converted into cargo ships. Seeing this situation, the metaphor of "using a bull knife to kill a chicken" floated into the reporter's mind again. Bull knife, bull knife, when will you find your bull? (Written by Wen Zhong)</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Crime of Treason for Employees of Organizations Under Enemy and Puppet Control: Must Depend on Whether There are Criminal Facts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously requested an explanation from the Guo medicine industry and other 50 industry associations regarding "whether serving as directors or supervisors of industry associations is treason." The request was submitted to the Executive and Legislative Yuans for explanation through a telegram, but there was no reply. Recently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a document again, and sent Supervisor Luo Qinghua to Beijing to urge for instructions. It is heard that Mr. Luo returned to Shanghai yesterday. The reporter, knowing that this case has attracted the close attention of all parties, made a special visit to Mr. Luo to inquire about the results. Mr. Luo said that the "Regulations on the Handling of Treason Cases" already clearly stipulate how to deal with people who held positions in people's organizations within the scope of enemy and puppet control. Industry associations and chambers of commerce are all industrial organizations. If they held positions within the scope of enemy and puppet control and had the facts of infringing on others by virtue of their power, they can be regarded as traitors if they are reported or accused, and comply with the provisions of rigorous investigation and prosecution. If they only held positions and there are no criminal facts described in the latter part of Section 10, they are not traitors and are not subject to the provisions of Article 15 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. It is said that the explanation of the Judicial Yuan is based on the legal meaning of this article. Furthermore, those who hold positions such as Baojia chiefs and Lianbao chiefs within the scope of enemy and puppet control should be "autonomous" personnel referred to in Section 10, not officials recommended by the enemy and puppet as in Section 1. If there are no criminal facts and they are reported or accused, they will also not be punished according to Article 15 of the Punishment Regulations. The "Regulations on the Handling of Treason Cases" is a procedural law for punishing traitors and should be based on this. The meanings of "affiliated" and "scope of jurisdiction" are different and cannot be discussed together. The phrase "under the rule of the puppet government" in the Executive Yuan's order has led to the mixing of the distinctly different "affiliated" and "scope of jurisdiction," which requires much explanation. During my trip to Beijing, I explained the previous situation to the senior officials of the Central Standing Committee, the Organization Department, the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, who have all understood. An instruction will be sent to the association soon.</p>
<h3>General Meeting and Dinner Party Held by Newspaper Colleagues Association</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Newspaper Colleagues Association held a general meeting and dinner party at the Fuzhou Road Fouhualou last night. More than 200 colleagues from the newspaper attended. Huang Jiping, Dong Jiancheng, Zhao Junhao, He Xiya, Zhao Zongyu, etc. were elected as the presidium. After reporting on the association's affairs, the handover ceremony for new and old staff members was held. Immediately after, a dinner party was held. During the dinner, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of the newspaper, gave a speech, saying that the newspaper is the oldest newspaper in China, which is well known. He wished to encourage his colleagues with the words "Although Zhou is an old country, its destiny is always new," hoping that they would redouble their efforts to make the oldest newspaper the newest and most progressive newspaper. Then, in the midst of exchanging toasts and flying lights, entertainment was held. Mr. Wang Ruoqi and Zhou Dongming, two famous Qin performers in Shanghai, played the strings for Zhai Pengnian, Shen Zhenchao, and Tong Xutian, reporters of the newspaper, and three famous ticket holders, Miss Zhu Min, Wu Husheng, and Mao Jinfang, all showed off their singing voices and had a great time.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Shanghai Women's Circles: The Women's Movement Association Plans to Open Relief Homes and Nurseries; the Women's Youth Association Provides Poor and Sick Loan of 50,000 Yuan Per Person</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to understand the general situation of the women's circles in this city, the reporter made a special visit to the Women's Movement Guidance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Women's Youth Association yesterday. Ms. Qian Jianqiu, the director of the Women's Movement Guidance Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said that it is extremely difficult to count the total number of working women in Shanghai. Among them, the largest number is of working women, followed by civil servants and teachers. There are currently 18 women's groups under the committee's jurisdiction, responsible for guiding the members. Furthermore, the association has always taken the promotion of women's rights and the relief of women's suffering as its purpose. In view of the large number of illiterates, it has already opened two labor literacy schools, one on Xiaosha Road and one in Pudong. The association is now working closely with the Social Affairs Bureau to open "Women's Relief Homes" and "Nurseries," with the aim of providing relief to poor women and infants. It is hoped that they will be established soon, and they are now actively working on it. In addition, the committee has also planned to set up a large "Household Goods Supply Cooperative," which will directly distribute daily service equipment to various manufacturers and sell it to relevant groups to avoid merchants from profiting from it. It will definitely benefit housewives a lot. However, the most difficult thing at present is housing, personnel, and funding. It is hoped that preparations can be made to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ms. Zhong Guoying, a worker in the Department of Working Women of the Women's Youth Association, said that the association's members include women from all walks of life. Its main task is to help prepare for women to establish organized groups in order to overcome difficulties with collective strength. The practical work that the association is currently actively carrying out is: (1) Job Placement: Anyone who is physically and mentally sound and has a reasonable attitude can register. This kind of work has never been interrupted for more than ten years. Many people have been continuously introduced to work in various agencies, most of them as tutors, nannies, and typists. (2) Poor and Sick Loans: Women who have productive capacity and are indeed poor and sick can apply to the association for a loan, with a limit of 50,000 yuan each time, to be repaid in installments after five months. The fund comes from the paper flowers that were sold on "March 8" Women's Day. It is said that there is still a balance. (3) Low-Priced Cafeteria: It will open in the association's dormitory on Yuemingyuan Road. Each customer will be given ten mouthfuls of bread, a cup of milk powder, and a little butter or jam for only 100 yuan. This is allocated by the "General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation" for 100 customers per day, limited to the association's members. Women in difficult circumstances can first apply to become members. The association is scheduled to move to 495 Gordon Road at the end of this month. (Xu Cai)</p>
<h3>Chen Guofu's First Visit to Shanghai After Victory</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Guofu, a member of the Central Standing Committee, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of [the] day at 3:50 PM, traveling from Nanjing on the "Victory" train. Upon arriving at 10:30 PM at the North Railway Station, he was greeted by over a hundred people including Wu Kaixian, Zhao Louhua, Zheng Yitong, Wu Shaoshu, Feng Youzhen, Wang Binxuan, Yu Songyun, Wu Rencang, Gao Mingqiang, Jiang Menglin, and Cao Jun.

<h3>Yuan Jufan and Wang Yongkang Each Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment, Li Hanqing Suffers Nervous Breakdown, Wailing and Answering Irrelevantly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court of [the] Jiangsu [Province] handed down verdicts yesterday on four cases of traitors: (1) Yuan Jufan, the former head of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau; (2) Wang Yongkang, a member of the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. The two criminals were found guilty of communicating with enemy countries and plotting to resist our own country. They were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment, deprived of their civil rights for five years, and all of their property, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, was confiscated. (3) Zhu Ruilin, the owner of a nail factory, was found guilty of colluding with enemy countries and supplying the enemy army with military supplies. He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprived of his civil rights for three years, and all of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. (4) Lu Laisheng was found guilty of colluding with enemy countries and plotting to resist our own country. He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprived of his civil rights for three years, and all of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated.</p>
<p>Li Zulai and Nine Others on Trial</p>
<p>The case of Li Zulai was also heard yesterday by the Special Criminal Court of the High Court. Li was wearing a lemon-colored silk long gown and new cloth shoes with white soles and black faces. According to his testimony, he was not a member of the Kuomintang and was the deputy manager of the An Yu Qian Zhuang before the war. His entry into the Bank of China was not due to influence, as his uncle and two elder brothers were originally managers of the Bank of China and had a historical relationship with the bank. He also stated that he never used the rescue of those arrested by puppet secret agents as a means to extort money, and that he had no special relationship with She Aizhen, the wife of Hu Shibaobiao. He requested that She Aizhen be summoned next time for a direct confrontation in court if they did not believe him. He further claimed, "I have never severed ties with the central government over the years. After the victory, I was introduced by Mr. Du Yuesheng to surrender to the Military Intelligence Bureau. I initially thought I could be released, but I never knew it would take nine months and I still haven't been cleared of wrongdoing." Subsequently, the defense attorney requested the court to summon witnesses Du Yuesheng and Wan Molin, and presented a letter of thanks from the famous writer Li Jianwu, who had been helped by the defendant to be rescued, as proof. After Clerk Li Jinzhang took detailed notes, Judge Yang Ding adjourned the hearing for further questioning.</p>
<p>Li Hanqing, a 56-year-old from Suzhou, was introduced to Japanese Major Nanben by Shao Shijun in 1937. Relying on enemy power, he forcibly seized our central tax revenue agency in the concession. Shao was then rewarded with the position of Chief of the Puppet Jiangsu Stamped Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau's Inspection Office. In the spring of 1941, he was transferred to the position of Director of the Guangdong Sericulture Office under the Puppet Ministry of Finance, and later transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Shanghai Sericulture Tax Bureau. When he was brought to trial yesterday, Li suffered from rheumatism and a nervous breakdown, rendering him unable to walk or speak. He was supported by two prisoners into the courtroom. Upon seeing his family in court, he burst into tears, and his wife cried even more bitterly. Judge Qiu then allowed him to sit down for questioning, but his wife continued to cry incessantly. The judge, finding that Li's responses were jumbled and incoherent, briefly questioned him before adjourning the hearing for further questioning. The defendant requested bail, and the court stated that a separate application must be submitted. The hearing was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cases of suspected traitors such as Fan Yongzeng, of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau; Ruan Xingzhou, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Radio Station of the puppet Political Security Bureau; Fu Hongyuan, staff member of the puppet Chamber of Commerce; Wang Xingjian, technician of the 76th Radio Station; and Guo Zhenxiang and Wu Baofu, detectives of the Dongchang Branch of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau; and Ha Junqiu, an intelligence officer of the puppet Zhenjiang Special Service Station, were also brought for questioning and adjourned for further hearings.</p>
<p>Two Cases Concluded</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Yuren and Cai Gengshun, who successively served as Section Chief and Deputy Director of the Special Consumption Tax Section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, Director of the County Administration Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, Lieutenant Colonel Instructor of the Pathogen of the Central Military Academy of the puppet Army, Director of the Zhejiang Eastern Supervisory Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Finance, and Chief Secretary and Magistrate of Hu County of the Sixth Administrative Inspectorate Office of the puppet Anhui Province, were tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. The defendants stated that they were 37 years old and were a middle school teacher before the war. They had eight family members to support and were forced by life, so in November 1939, through a friend's introduction, they met Luo Junqiang and took up a puppet position. They deeply regretted it now. However, during his tenure in 1942, he rescued Ju Jing, a special commissioner of the China Seamen's Special Party Department who was detained by the enemy's Gendarmerie in Petain Road. Moreover, after the victory, on September 28th of last year, he surrendered to the Military Intelligence Bureau on Avenue Dubail. He hoped to be leniently dealt with and given a chance to start anew, for which he would be eternally grateful. The defendant also hired a lawyer for defense, and Ju Jing also appeared in court to testify. The court concluded the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:30 PM on the 22nd.</p>
<p>On the same day, the case of Xue Qishou, an executive officer of the Suzhou Station of the puppet Secret Service Headquarters, was also concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Production Volume of China Textile Corporation: One Thousand Pieces of Yarn and Approximately Twenty-Three Thousand Bolts of Cloth Produced Day and Night</h3>
<p>According to a recent survey, the production capacity of China Textile Corporation is approximately one thousand pieces of yarn and twenty-three thousand bolts of cloth produced on average day and night. These are sold daily at market prices, and the production volume can maintain balance with current needs. Recently, the company was also ordered to produce 1.2 million bolts of military cloth. In order to cooperate with the improvement of the quality of the army, the company has strictly stipulated the standards for the cloth and notified various factories to deliver the goods on schedule, so it has greatly increased the number of machines used to supply the weaving of this military cloth. In addition, the company is also actively expanding its silk products. These finished products can be used as raw materials for shirts and women's underwear, which are popular with Westerners. One million yards have already been sold to the United States. Furthermore, linen products such as linen cloth are also being processed and manufactured. Linen products can be used as raw materials for sacks, with a daily output of over eighty bolts, which is in short supply. Linen cloth has a daily output of over forty bolts and can be used as summer suit fabrics.</p>

<h3>Joe Louis Fight</h3>
<p>Could Earn 900,000 US Dollars</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis will face his strong rival Combes in a duel here on the 19th of this month. There will definitely be a fierce battle. It is heard that regardless of who wins the game, the income will be shared by the two. Joe Louis will receive twice as much as Combes. Joe Louis may receive 900,000 US dollars, and Combass will receive 450,000 US dollars. The exact amount will depend on the number of tickets sold.

<p>Many Subjects Do Not Necessarily Kill Children; Examination is What Harms Children's Physical and Mental Health</p>
<p>A lively and intelligent child unfortunately died of tuberculosis after three years of schooling. A certain parent blamed the heavy elementary school curriculum and the excessive number of subjects. Judging from the facts, it seems to be true. In fact, even if we assume that each subject is a poison that harms children, dividing it into several small packages and eating them separately (i.e., separating each subject) is better than combining them into a few large packages and swallowing them whole (i.e., merging related subjects). So, I think that when revising the elementary school curriculum, there is no need to calculate the number of subjects based on the combination or separation of subjects. If the subjects are listed more specifically on the timetable, the preparation before class can be clearer and easier for children and teachers. Therefore, I advocate that elementary school subjects may as well be separated! Many subjects do not necessarily kill children. What can harm children's physical and mental health is the examination! Because in elementary schools, there are monthly tests, semester exams, temporary tests, and graduation exams. Most teachers do not use these to examine whether the teaching materials and methods are suitable for general children, but instead use them as a means to force children to study hard, deliberately making children's spirits and emotions very tense! Children with a competitive spirit become uneasy while eating and cannot sleep well, always in the terror of passing or failing, feeling dizzy and mentally and physically exhausted. The experts who revise the elementary school curriculum standards, I wonder if they might agree to reduce the suggestion of monthly tests, so that the weak children's physical and mental health will not be excessively stimulated and tense, and they can develop and grow naturally! (Qian Dasan, 35, 6, 13, in Zhenjiang).</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Social Affairs Strictly Limits Rice Shops' Sales Profits to No More Than 6% of the Selling Price; Rice Shops Must Register All Rice Stock</h3>
<p>Various rice shops in this city purchase grain and sell it to citizens, but there has never been a standard for the profits they take, resulting in inconsistent retail rice prices. Moreover, most do not issue invoices when selling, which easily leads to abuses. Now, the Bureau of Social Affairs of this city has specially ordered the Rice Shop Merchants' Association to correct this. The instructions are recorded as follows: "Upon investigation, the price difference between the purchase price of rice and the retail price at rice shops in this city is vast. If this is not corrected, it will seriously affect the people's food supply, which is truly inappropriate. After careful consideration, it has been decided that, from the date of this order, the retail price of each rice shop must not exceed 6% of the total purchase price. Invoices must be issued upon sale, and the names and addresses of the buyers must be separately registered for verification. The Association is hereby ordered to quickly forward this order to all its affiliated rice shops for compliance."</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been learned that recently some rice shops have been selling all their rice stock mixed with impurities in the hope of obtaining even greater profits. They are also claiming that their stock is low and not easily purchased on the market, so they are applying to be allocated rice at market prices. However, after investigation by the Association, these rice shops still have sufficient stock to meet the needs of their retail outlets. This is a case of illegal hoarding and refusal to sell. To prevent hoarding and promote the widespread circulation of rice, the Rice Shop Merchants' Association is registering rice stocks. If a rice shop's stock is indeed scarce and cannot be purchased on the market, the Association will request the rice market to allocate rice at market prices. As for the rice shops that have been approved to request rice allocation, in addition to the 33 approved on the 13th, another 145 were added on the 14th, and it is said that there were more than a hundred more yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market opened unchanged. Flour was sluggish, factory prices were uncertain, bran sellers were eager to sell, new bran was expected soon, and confidence was low, falling by one or two hundred yuan. Soybean cake fell by two or three hundred yuan, soybeans fell by five or six hundred to one thousand yuan, wheat was stable, broad beans were arriving in large quantities from various sources, the market was oversupplied, and the situation was weak. Oil prices were also stable. The number of customers and goods registered at the rice market yesterday increased slightly, totaling 3,221 *shi*, including 534 *shi* of white *japonica* rice, 433 *shi* of *indica* rice, 38 *shi* of early rice, 570 *shi* of *yangyou* rice, 379 *shi* of *duyou* rice, 617 *shi* of *wuyou* rice, 7 *shi* of white *yuan* rice, and 703 *shi* of milled rice.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Dip Slightly</h3>
<p>Refined gold was slightly flatter yesterday. Reports indicated that there was still hope for the current situation, and many people were selling off their holdings. After opening, the price rose briefly to 1.93 million yuan, but was soon suppressed. US dollars eased, falling to 1.89 million yuan during the session, before receiving some support. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 182 bars at a price of 1.9 million yuan. After this, the situation stabilized, hovering around 1.91 million yuan. In the afternoon, the US dollar fell sharply, and gold prices were also dragged down slightly. However, due to the fact that it was Saturday, it was not easy to sell. Compared to the asking price, it fell by 45,000 yuan. Gold ornaments were 1 million yuan, silver bullion was 2,200 yuan, and silver dollars were selling for 1,380 yuan. The black market exchange rate was stable, and interest rates did not change.</p>
<h3>Large Investors Exit, Government Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two large investors exited the government bond market at the 7th floor. After opening, the price fell from 4,900 yuan to 4,500 yuan, before being slightly absorbed by a certain Northern gang on the 5th floor, ending at 4,600 yuan. As a result, it closed 450 yuan lower than the previous day. Category D bonds only fell by 100 yuan due to bargain hunting. Categories A and B also fell by 350 yuan, and Category E fell by 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Rise, Silk Goods See Another Opportunity</h3>
<p>Rayon continued to rise sharply yesterday. No. 120 Tianqiao had bright stock, opening at 1.58 million yuan, with the highest bid at 630,000 yuan, before returning to 578,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, it traded at 560,000 yuan, resulting in a rise of 40,000 yuan from the previous day. No. 120 Meinu traded at 1.5 million yuan in the morning and 430,000 yuan in the afternoon. Xuhui traded at 1.451 million yuan in the morning and 400,000 yuan in the afternoon. Semi-dull goods were in high demand, and the price was particularly good, rising by 780,000 yuan. No. 75 Jin Nan Banyan was priced similarly to the previous day. Silk goods, which had been weak for two days, saw another opportunity yesterday. Mei Ya quilt covers traded at 1.58 million yuan per 100 pieces. Da Cheng checkered silk traded at 5,700 yuan per yard for immediate delivery and 7,730 yuan for future delivery, up 450 yuan from the previous day. The raw silk market was stable. User silk, superior grade 20/22, traded at 2.15 million to 2.22 million yuan. Ten bales of Jardine Matheson goods traded yesterday, priced at 1.8 million yuan. There were no transactions in user Jardine Matheson goods, and asking prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Silk Fabrics and Decorative Items Are in High Demand in the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the war, housing allocation in the United States is also very uneven. Therefore, people's residential areas are never excessively luxurious, but strive to meet practical needs. The arrangement of interior furniture also adopts small and exquisite styles. Therefore, decorative items on the surface are also small-sized silk fabrics as their demand target. Before the war, our country's silk fabrics sold well in the US market and enjoyed a long-standing reputation. Therefore, the demand for our Chinese goods is very eager.</p>
<h3>Ramie Cloth Is in Season, Supply Is Scarce and Prices Are Very High</h3>
<p>Ramie cloth from Jiangxi, especially from counties such as Wanzai, Yihuang, and Shanggao, has a more abundant output and is of excellent quality. In the Shanghai market, ramie cloth has a smooth and broad sales channel for clothing and mosquito nets. However, due to poor transportation, there are no large shipments to Shanghai. Currently, it relies only on peddlers for transportation and sales, resulting in a small quantity and high prices due to express shipping and high transportation costs. A few days ago, more than a hundred pieces of Shanggao ramie cloth arrived in Shanghai and were snapped up in an instant. There is currently no stock available. According to industry insiders, if large quantities can be shipped to Shanghai, transportation costs will be lower and prices can be slightly stabilized.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Cannot Be Converted, US Dollar Plummets</h3>
<p>The Central Bank issued a special notice yesterday to all designated foreign exchange banks stating that, from today, regarding all prohibited import goods and goods listed in Central Bank Notice No. 42, as well as other unapproved applications, the designated banks shall not accept foreign currency banknotes or sell foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Regulations have also been stipulated regarding foreign currency trading by the 250 Class A foreign exchange firms in this city. They must report to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank every week. If any activity exceeding the scope is discovered, their operating permit will be revoked. As for foreign currency exports, the limit remains at 200 yuan per person. Exceeding this limit requires special permission from the Ministry of Finance; otherwise, the local customs authorities will handle the matter according to law upon discovery.</p>
<p>The US dollar opened at around 2,730 yuan and was immediately surrounded by selling pressure. Soon after, it fell to 2,670 yuan before receiving support. However, the process was mediocre and trading was not very active. It remained at around 2,700 yuan until noon, and the situation still felt unsustainable. In the afternoon, due to the fact that it was Saturday, sellers, due to rumors that foreign firms were prohibiting the acceptance of US dollars, were cutting prices to sell. There was a lack of support. Although trading was light, asking prices fell sharply. Bids fell to 2,400 yuan. Hong Kong dollars also fell by 5 yuan, Indian rupees by 560 yuan, and Hong Kong exchange by 455 yuan, with few transactions.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Suddenly Soars</h3>
<p>Since the previous week, the asphalt market has suddenly become active, and the market has turned sharply upward. Hangzhou is facing a shortage of supply due to the scarcity of sources from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in no goods available. Internal asphalt has risen from 50,000 yuan to slightly over 60,000 yuan, and Shuanglian mixed oil has also increased to 55,000 yuan. In just one week, all oils have risen by more than 10,000 yuan, breaking the dull situation of the past six months. During this reporter's trip to the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area, observations revealed that inventories are extremely low. The stock of high-quality goods such as Heben asphalt is estimated to be less than 3,000 pieces. To meet the autumn demand, there is a risk of interruption. It is also said that the stocks in Jinlan and other places are also very low. Therefore, it is difficult to expect Zhejiang oil to flood in. However, Hubei asphalt is blocked in the production area, and the quantity is actually quite large. If transportation can be smoothed, large quantities will certainly be shipped. Shanghai can choose between the north and the south, taking the cheaper option. Otherwise, there will be no supply. Recently, various firms have already procured about 1,000 pieces from Hankou. It is said that the combined arrival price of Macheng oil in Shanghai is no more than 50,000 yuan, arriving soon. The sharp rise in Zhejiang oil will certainly be hit. The selling prices of various firms have been increased along with the market. It is estimated that Heben oil is 80,000 yuan, internal asphalt is 72,000 yuan, Du asphalt is 68,000 yuan, Deqian is 64,000 yuan, Lan oil is 60,000 yuan, and Macheng oil is 55,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>5,000 Tons of Cork Shipped from Norway to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A large shipment of cork has arrived in Shanghai. During the war, cork imports to Shanghai disappeared, and there was a great shortage of bottle stoppers. It is now learned that the Norwegian vessel "Jing Hai Ke Qi Hao," managed by Tianxiang Foreign Firm, has shipped 5,000 tons of cork from Oslo, Norway. The ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening and is docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading. It is also reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Chen" ship sailed to Taiwan with a small amount of cargo, only about 1,200 tons, of which rapeseed cake accounted for the majority with more than 3,430 pieces.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Cloth Are Both Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and sales were sluggish because various trading groups had extremely light demand. Due to the weekend, there were few transactions in the market. 20-count yarn fell by 120,000 yuan, and small-count yarn was particularly weak because the market in the interior was also very depressed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraph reported a drop of 17 to 24 points. The near-term was US$29.06, the forward was US$29.24, and the Memphis spot price was US$29.87. Spot cotton trading in this port was stagnant because US cotton had fallen back, and it was also Saturday. Factories were mostly taking a wait-and-see approach and there were no negotiations. Only flower shops made some small purchases. Market prices were stable.</p>
<p>Grey cloth continued to show weakness because demand from all sides was weak, and it was also the time for the China Textile Construction Company to open sales. Everyone was watching and not moving forward. Prices of cloth from various shops fell by 250 to 500 yuan. However, blue cloth is gradually entering its peak season, and bleached cloth is scarce and relatively stable. When the China Textile Construction Company opened sales, the goods listed were not very enthusiastic. There was no drill. The price of grey cloth fell by 500 yuan compared to the previous period. Drill rose by 500 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Under the Pull of Major Investors, Yong'an Yarn Makes Progress; Greater China Increases Capital and Issues Dividends</h3>
<p>After a slight rest the day before yesterday, major investors in the Chinese stock market rose again yesterday, still making progress in Yong'an Yarn. The rest of the stocks were lagging behind. Yong'an Yarn rose from 6,400 yuan to 6,720 yuan, and then slightly retreated. Mei Ya retreated from 4,700 yuan to a low price at closing. The three small stocks also went from high to low. The rise and fall of unpopular medium-sized stocks were mixed. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong'an Yarn rose by more than 200 yuan. Mei Ya, Jingfu, and Xinguang all fell slightly. The same was true for unpopular small stocks. The rise and fall of medium-sized stocks were mixed. Veteran stocks were slightly weak. Yong'an Company rose again. Foreign stocks were calm as usual, resulting in less speculative activity. The process was extremely mediocre. The supply was more abundant, and the situation was slightly depressed. At noon closing, compared to the day before, Yi Yarn, Yi Beer, Gangye, British Linen, and Guanghuitdefeng all continued to fall slightly. Paper Industry Asia was still stable due to its low price.</p>
<p>Greater China Match held its shareholders' meeting yesterday and resolved to change the registered capital from 100 million fake yuan to 100 million legal tender and to issue a dividend of 8% and a bonus of 1.9%.</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Production Decreases</h3>
<p>The production of new Qimen black tea in Anhui this year is not optimistic. The output has been greatly reduced, mainly only around 30,000 *dan*, which is truly vastly different from previous years. As for the tea market in this city, trading has also decreased because the sellers are stubbornly raising prices. The supply has suddenly become scarce. Although shops and guest firms on this street and other places have demand, it is not easy to purchase smoothly, so prices remain stable.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Hyperinflation: Astronomical Numbers Reappear</h3>
<p>[United Press Budapest, 14th] The inflation in Hungary is still endless. A streetcar ticket costs 1,600,000,000,000 pengő. A newspaper costs 2,000,000,000,000 pengő. The new high value of the Hungarian pengő against the US dollar is a ratio of 1,000,000,000,000,000 pengő to one US dollar (this number is accurate).</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Will Sell Silver in London</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 15th] It is reported that the Soviet Union may sell silver in the London free market, seemingly with the intention of selling low-priced silver and obtaining high-priced British pounds. Currently, the free selling price of silver in London is between 280 pence per ounce. The Soviet Union may sell it at a slightly higher price. This price has exceeded the US limit price of 71.11 cents (equivalent to 42.4 pence). Based on this, the current London silver price is actually equal to US$1.00, which has exceeded the domestic silver price of 90.03 cents per ounce for the next two years approved by the US Senate Appropriations Committee. The US Senate Committee has approved that the US domestic silver price can be increased to 129 cents after two years. This number is larger than the current price in London and is comparable to the high price in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Cotton Exports: Government Issues New Regulations</h3>
<p>[Reuters Rio de Janeiro, 15th] The Brazilian Ministry of Finance has announced that, henceforth, for Brazilian cotton exports, exporters must prove that 30% of the exported cotton was purchased from government reserves in order to be approved. This is a newly announced regulation aimed at reducing government reserves and removing the government's "competition" in the cotton export market.</p>
<h3>US Car Prices Increase; Further Increases May Be Necessary in the Future</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 14th] By order of the government, the prices of many US cars have been increased again by 4% to 8% based on the previous price increase. According to government officials, the Price Administration may order another price increase. According to the recent price increase, the export prices of 16 models of cars from Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Hudson, Nash, Packard, and Studebaker have increased by US$33 to US$167 each, with an average increase of US$87.50. The reason for the price increase is said to be to compensate for the losses incurred by various companies due to increased wages and the purchase of high-priced steel and other manufactured parts. However, the price increase order does not apply to cars manufactured in Europe after the war, but all cars manufactured after May 22 can still be priced higher, and car buyers must pay the full amount according to the newly set prices.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Information</h3>
<p>Timber: The market is showing a fluctuating situation, with slight rises and falls, and trading is weak. It is reported that more foreign pine continues to arrive, so the price is soft and weak.</p>
<p>Bricks and Ashes: Sales in the market have been average for days because factory repairs and separate purchases of shops are still considered prosperous, so market prices will not fall miserably for the time being.</p>
<p>Pepper: The trend has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, the Nanjing gang began to favor it, and demand was average. Unexpectedly, the Hankou gang followed closely behind, and the market suddenly became active, rising by about 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: Guest firms are quite active in moving saccharin and quinine, and prices are firm. Penicillin shipments continue to arrive, and the price is tending to fall.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Direct sales of British-American cigarettes have become smoother, and prices are rising in unison. Except for a slight rise in Gaole and Brandy cigarettes from Chinese merchants, the rest are stable.</p>
<p>Chemical Raw Materials: Various goods are still trending weakly. The price of imported caustic soda is only half of the market price, so all parties are weak. Soda ash is slightly popular due to strong export sales.</p>
<h3>Export Loans: Maximum Term is Three Months, Loaned at 70% of the Goods' Value</h3>
<p>To support the export industry, the Central Bank has launched low-interest loans for exporters. After formulating measures and soliciting opinions from the banking and export industries in advance, it began to implement them on the 14th, and the designated banks are following them. Exporters who apply for loans from the designated banks can be loaned in advance. If the funds are insufficient, the Central Bank will provide them as much as possible at a simple interest rate of 6%. The loan period must not exceed three months. The loan is 70% of the value of the goods of each exporter. The target of the loan is exporters with a long history and reliable credit. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank, who spoke to a reporter, the bank has always handled import and export businesses in accordance with the government's established policies, and is currently using various methods to assist and support them as much as possible within its power. This time, the low-interest loans for the export industry are only one aspect of support, aimed at reducing costs, opening up the international market, and developing international trade. In the future, it will also provide assistance with transportation and other issues.</p>
<h3>World Cotton Production Decreases Sharply</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 14th] According to statistics from the US Department of Agriculture, the total amount of world cotton currently on the market is 21,655,000 bales (calculated at 478 pounds per bale), which is the smallest amount in 22 years. The current cotton harvest has decreased by 12% compared to 1944-45 and 30% compared to the average harvest before the war (i.e., 31,000,000 bales).</p>
<p>The US cotton production this year is estimated to be about 9,015,000 bales, compared to 12,230,000 bales last year and an average of 13,149,000 bales before the war. In addition to the United States, the cotton production this year is about 2,900,000 bales in India, 1,091,000 bales in Egypt, 1,950,000 bales in Brazil, and 1,875,000 bales in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Five Associations Jointly Telegraph the Ministry of Economic Affairs: The Call to Control Yarn Prices; Hoping that the Textile Construction Company Will Restrain and Stabilize Market Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to the soaring price of yarn, the Handkerchief Industry Association, the Underwear Industry Association, the Knitting Industry Association, the Towel and Blanket Industry Association, and the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city are finding it difficult to manufacture and sell their products due to the high cost of raw materials. After a meeting at the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss rescue methods, it was decided to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to implement yarn price controls in order to maintain production. Excerpts from their original request are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Rises 5,000 Times; Prices Rise 3,000 Times</p>
<p>Last September, the average selling price of 20-count yarn was only 117,500 yuan, but now it has risen to a huge 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Compared to the 25th year of the Republic, it has risen more than 5,000 times, while the general price index is still only around 3,000 times. It is clear that the increase in raw material prices is leading to price increases and threatening the manufacturing industry. Initially, our industry believed that the Japanese textile industry, which was our most fierce competitor and imposed the most pressure, had disappeared. Domestic and Southeast Asian markets could take the opportunity to revitalize Chinese goods. However, the soaring price of cotton yarn makes it difficult for manufactured goods to break even. The domestic market will be occupied by foreigners, and it will be difficult to expand foreign sales without restraining yarn prices. According to statistics, in the 25th year of the Republic, each *dan* of cotton cost 40 yuan. In the 35th year of the Republic, in April, it cost 90,000 yuan. The multiple of increase is 2,250 times. The cost of 20-count cotton yarn in the 25th year was 233.8 yuan, and in April of the 35th year, it was 1.2 million yuan. The multiple of increase is 5,125 times. According to the fact that each piece of 20-count yarn weighs 400 pounds and requires 350 *jin* of cotton, calculated at the average market price of cotton in May, which is 90,000 yuan per *jin*, then each piece of yarn requires 315,000 yuan in raw material costs. Other costs such as wages, power, and manufacturing are about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, so the total cost is about 700,000 yuan. Last month, the average price of yarn cloth was 1.2 million yuan, and the profit margin was more than 70%. The profit margin for other fine yarns is even greater. At a time when cotton production is still low, wages are high, and taxes are heavy, yarn factories should be able to balance profits by selling cotton yarn at a fair price. Manufacturing industries of cotton products are no longer the enemy of foreign goods. Now, they disregard everything, scooping up high profits, causing cotton product factories to be unable to stop or close. Opening factories is not easy, so they have to reluctantly buy in to avoid the cutoff of raw materials. If the direct costs cannot be controlled, then they have to take from one place to pay for another, reducing indirect costs, and even subsidizing with their own capital to barely maintain production. However, income does not cover expenses, and the day of total collapse is not far off. Among them, there are many factories that are unable to support themselves and finally close down. If one industry thrives while many industries wither, prices rise while people's livelihoods are strained, and the yarn industry will be difficult to enjoy its benefits for long, and how can it be obtained? We believe that price controls are a necessary measure when the economy has not yet returned to normal. Developed countries in Europe and America have mostly not abolished them.</p>
<p>Take the Price of Rice as an Example; Control Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>Take the price of rice in this city last month as an example. Once controls were implemented, it immediately dropped from 70,000 to within 50,000. Now, for the price of yarn, the raw material for clothing, is rampant, how can we continue to let it go? The state-owned China Textile Construction Company, which controls yarn cloth and influences the market, should set an example and restrain market prices. If privately-owned yarn factories still raise yarn prices, then the government should strongly suppress them. If it is unavoidable, the effect can be seen. Not only is this what our industry expects, but it is also what patriots feel. Some may think that the high price of yarn is due to supply not meeting demand. However, judging from the existing yarn spindles of the China Textile Construction Company, only half are in operation. Its production capacity should be expanded. If the goal is not to make excessive profits, then how can restraining yarn prices hinder the increase in production? In order to jointly maintain the current industrial crisis and preserve the weak foundation of the cotton products industry, we dare to jointly request the Chairman to review and approve the implementation of controls on the selling price of cotton yarn, stipulate the maximum profit, earnestly increase production, and order the China Textile Construction Company to implement it first, so that the cotton products industry can survive, and the people's livelihood after the war can be restored. We await your orders with utmost respect.</p>

<h3>For Demanding the Liquidation of the Traitorous Literary Scoundrel Cen Weixiu, the "National Daily" Was Ordered to Cease Publication by the Hong Kong Government</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan</p>
<p>This paper's Hong Kong, 11th dispatch</p>
<p>For the past half-month, rain clouds brought by subtropical monsoons have obscured the towering Victoria Peak in Hong Kong. The low atmospheric pressure has made people feel suffocated, as if foreshadowing a major event about to occur.</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the Chairman's Guangzhou Headquarters announced the second list of wanted traitors. Because the Huai Prefecture [area] had resumed the agreement with our side during the period of civil and military administration, all agreements were invalid. Therefore, the Headquarters had specially sent Li Hanchong, the director of the General Staff Office, to Hong Kong in advance to discuss new methods for arresting traitors with the Governor, determined to intensify the work of eliminating traitors without avoiding the relatively special environment of Hong Kong. The traitors hiding in Hong Kong are facing their doomsday, everyone is in danger, and they are urgently seeking ways to escape.</p>
<h3>The "Republican Daily" Requests the Arrest of Cen Weixiu</h3>
<p>One of the names on the second list is Cen Weixiu (a native of Enping County, Guangdong, in his fifties), the chief cultural traitor in Hong Kong, the general manager and printer of the "Overseas Chinese Daily," whose investigation has been strongly advocated by Hong Kong public opinion for half a year. The overseas Chinese community was excited to hear the news. On the 7th, the "National Daily" published an article titled "Wanted Cen Weixiu," promoting the overseas Chinese community to "take united action to thoroughly liquidate Cen and his 'Overseas Chinese Daily,'" and put forward three principles: (1) Cen must be captured alive, (2) the "Overseas Chinese Daily" must be boycotted immediately, and (3) the movement of assets and equipment of Cen and the "Overseas Chinese Daily" must be closely monitored. "Overseas Chinese are requested to take immediate action." On the 8th, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" published an article titled "For National Integrity and Social Justice," praising our authorities' actions in eliminating traitors, and believing that "the 'Overseas Chinese Daily,' which has always been promoting for the enemy, destroying the war of resistance, criticizing the Allied countries, and insulting the leader, is still published as usual, which is a great shame on social justice." Therefore, "it is hoped that the local authorities will seriously consider allowing the publication of the 'Overseas Chinese Daily.'" Also, "it is hoped that the patriotic overseas Chinese in Hong Kong will make a solemn statement on sanctioning this enemy newspaper in order to maintain the dignity of national laws and regulations." Guo Bingqi, the Major General of the Guangzhou Headquarters' Military Inspectorate in Hong Kong and Kowloon, also met with reporters from Hong Kong on the 7th and asked "overseas Chinese to pay close attention to the actions of traitors, report to the government anytime and anywhere, and fulfill their obligation to assist the government in arresting traitors." The surging righteousness is enough to seize the courage of the traitors.</p>
<h3>The Governor of Hong Kong Orders the Newspaper to Cease Publication for One Month</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 8th, a bolt from the blue struck. The Governor of Hong Kong, together with the Legislative Council, issued an order: ordering the "National Daily" to cease publication for one month from the 8th. According to a government spokesperson, "The promulgation of this order is because the Legislative Council believes that the content of the second editorial of the newspaper on Friday, June 7th of this year—Reporter's note: The second editorial of the 'National Daily' on that day was 'The Last Way for the Communist Party to Serve the Country 1,' and the second was the aforementioned 'Wanted Cen Weixiu'—is to cause the public to misunderstand the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities' legal extradition of enemy elements, and contains the meaning of encouraging the public to despise Hong Kong laws and order." It is "implemented according to Article 24 of the Second Ordinance of the 1922 Defense Act published by Government Notice No. 775 on the October 7, 1938 Gazette."</p>
<p>At the same time as this decree was issued by the Hong Kong Government Information Services, about 30 hours after the "National Daily's" article on Cen Weixiu met with readers, armed police officers from the Hong Kong government, carrying an emergency warrant, ran to the "National Daily" office, which was established by the Propaganda Department of our country, to carry out the task of sealing the newspaper. After the newspaper protested against the sudden order, the newspaper's office, composing room, and printing press were sealed off: a small hemp rope was passed through the door buckle, and both ends of the hemp rope were sealed with red sealing wax on a thick white paper with the words "This house is sealed by order, and no one is allowed to enter without authorization, by order of the police superintendent." Two armed police officers were stationed outside the gate day and night. On the morning of the 9th, when the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong saw the "Emergency Announcement of the National Daily" and the news that the "National Daily" was ordered to cease publication for one month by the Hong Kong government published in various newspapers, the sound of the British court's wise instructions to promote reform of the political system and strengthen Sino-British alliance friendship suddenly occurred, causing a few stubborn colonial bureaucrats to disregard our government agencies and stifle public opinion. Therefore, it attracted their attention even more than the Pingshan Airport incident last winter. The reporter sent an urgent telegram at 5 pm on the 9th to briefly report the situation. Now, given the importance of the law and national system, I will inform the compatriots who are concerned about the Hong Kong issue about the causes and consequences of the incident:</p>
<p>Since Japan's surrender, Hong Kong has become a refuge for traitors, big and small, in the South China region. Loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, and black and white must be distinguished, so there has been discussion of the issue of eliminating traitors. On January 8th of this year, the "National Daily" published an article on "Thoroughly Eliminating Traitors." On the 15th of the same month, it published another article "Eliminating Traitors Often Begins with Culture," and on the 17th, it questioned "Where Do Cultural Traitors Go?" On February 6th, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" published two editorials, "Sino-British Cooperation to Search for and Arrest War Criminals in Hiding." On the same day, the evening edition of the newspaper published an open letter detailing the enemy newspaper. Later, under the title "Please Look at the Ugly Face of the Enemy Newspaper," it successively published editorials of the "Overseas Chinese Daily" during the period of Hong Kong's occupation, which were all malicious and inflammatory words used by the "Overseas Chinese Daily" to promote for the enemy, making people's hair stand on end when reading them!</p>
<h3>Negotiations Were Conducted, but Repeatedly Restricted by the Environment</h3>
<p>At that time, our authorities had already conducted close negotiations with the Hong Kong government, but due to the special environment of Hong Kong, the newspapers were unable to fully express their opinions and call for further action. On April 19th, the "Overseas Chinese Daily," which had not been republished for long, published an article demanding that our anti-traitor authorities stationed in Hong Kong "punish Cen Weixiu of the 'Overseas Chinese Daily.'" The wording and sentences used were more direct and clear than before. The "Overseas Chinese Daily" was shocked and ashamed under the banner of justice, and did not hesitate to use all means to struggle and try to reverse the declining trend. The reporter's dispatch on "Hong Kong's Cultural Barrier" on May 8th has already been reported in detail, and it is believed that the readers will remember it. On that day, the "National Daily" published an article "Serving the People and Severing Ties with Traitors" and published "A Letter to Mr. Xu Shiying Regarding the 'Overseas Chinese Daily's' Speculation in Fundraising and Disaster Relief," exposing the "Overseas Chinese Daily's" conspiracy to obtain titles from political figures, confuse overseas Chinese, launch disaster relief, and deceive the government, giving the traitors a merciless blow. After the Guangzhou Headquarters issued an announcement on May 17th to announce the first list of key members of puppet organizations or traitors with serious crimes, the anti-traitor work in Hong Kong has entered a new stage, and the prestige of justice has greatly increased. On May 24th, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" published an editorial "Distinguishing Between Loyalty, Treachery, Good and Evil." The Guangzhou Headquarters' second list of traitors was announced. The newspapers witnessed that the national law had been established and believed that the time was ripe to speak freely, which led to the unfortunate incident of the "National Daily" being ordered to cease publication. However, this incident shocked the overseas Chinese community and taught them how the stubborn elements in the Hong Kong government treat our government's laws and decrees, and the institutions they have established, and how they treat those who are traitors and have betrayed their country, whom more than 90% of the residents of Hong Kong despise. At the same time, they also saw one of the reasons why the anti-traitor work has been launched for half a year but has not yet achieved significant results.</p>
<h3>Full of Praise for the Barbarians, Showing Shameful Traces of Insulting England</h3>
<p>Just as millions of overseas Chinese could not have dreamed that after our Headquarters explicitly announced the list of wanted traitors, the Hong Kong government, which has paid special attention to the friendship between China and Britain after the war, would give the "National Daily," which represents the opinions of the overseas Chinese, such a severe punishment, they also could not have dreamed that the "Overseas Chinese Daily," which boasts of "subtly implying to the readers to enhance their beliefs," would make a straightforward statement in the conclusion of its editorial "A Few Words to All Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong" the day after the "National Daily" was ordered to cease publication: "We are greatly encouraged by the wise local authorities, which further enhances our excitement and firm confidence." The "Overseas Chinese Daily" "cleverly" used the word "encouragement" to lightly shift the monstrous crimes committed in the past onto the "wise local authorities." The "Overseas Chinese Daily's" support for the Japanese寇's actions to destroy our country's war of resistance may be ignored by the British, but the "Overseas Chinese Daily's" past full of "British barbarians" and "British barbarians," and its extreme insults to the British Empire and its royal family, were also encouraged by the "wise local authorities"? Cen Weixiu was so ecstatic that he not only angered the overseas Chinese community, but perhaps even angered the British, who uphold justice, enforce the law like a mountain, and have allied with China!</p>
<h3>Cherishing Diplomatic Relations, Hoping the British Authorities Will Consider</h3>
<p>The British authorities' spirit of the rule of law has always been admired by people around the world, and the overseas Chinese, who cherish the precious friendship built by China and Britain for more than 100 years, especially in this war where they have shared weal and woe, pay close attention to the defense law promulgated before the war under special circumstances, but applied to Hong Kong after the war, where London has decided to give the people greater freedom. They feel that after this Pacific War, although the vicious Japanese have been defeated by the Allies, the defense law that punishes the "National Daily" for promoting sanctions against big traitors once allowed the Japanese to publish newspapers in Hong Kong that slandered our government and undermined our war of resistance. Since this law can be applied today, the Japanese can come to Hong Kong again to run the "Hong Kong Daily" before the war! Some overseas Chinese even pointed out that the Hong Kong government's re-announcement of the defense law in 1938 was the day when the Japanese, who were hostile to our country, were carrying out large-scale activities in Hong Kong. Given this relationship, they are looking forward to a clear attitude from the wise London authorities.</p>
<p>After our supreme commander Chiang Kai-shek ordered British General Xia Hui to represent the acceptance of the surrender of the Japanese army in Hong Kong in the Chinese war zone, they firmly believed that the British authorities had adopted an equal attitude towards them. All the bad measures before the war should no longer exist. Now, the "National Daily," which is sponsored by our government, has been severely punished for advocating taking action against wanted traitors. However, the overseas Chinese still believe that the Hong Kong authorities, which are so compliant with local laws, should not despise the national laws of their allied country, which is close at hand. They would not protect a wanted traitor who has sold himself to the enemy, and sacrifice the friendship of millions of Hong Kong overseas Chinese, or even 450 million Chinese people. Therefore, until now, they have not lost their cherish for the friendship between China and Britain. The reporter has reason to believe that the wise British authorities will not let them lose this cherish, and at the same time arouse unanimous resentment from the entire Chinese people!</p>

<h3>The Government's Responsibility to Refugee Youth</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: Thank you very much for publishing the words of "The Voices of Refugees" in your newspaper. However, the admirers are probably only us, the group of refugees! Only refugees know the taste of being a refugee. We only brought out the few coins we had, but we have to cope with this environment where everything costs money. The shadows of hunger and death are always behind each of us refugees. But we can't wait to die, we still have to live. We all have the ability to work, but where is there a place that is willing to employ us refugees who are poorly clothed and have no "substantial guarantor"? We have also done our best for the war of resistance. Now that we have won, why does the country listen to us and not care about us? We don't need to talk about our plight in vain. We must ask the government to give us work to do, and use our brains to exchange for the necessary food and clothing. We must ask the government to immediately implement the following measures: (1) Conduct refugee youth registration; (2) Concentrate refugee youth to stabilize their lives; (3) Test each person's knowledge and ability; (4) Assign them to various government agencies, schools, factories, and shops to enable them to do their jobs. The above four points are easy for the government to do. But for us refugee youth, we don't know how to praise and sing their praises!</p>

<h3>The Suffering of the People of Yancheng</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: It is now the stage where the Communist Party of Northern Jiangsu has become deeply rooted. In the past, it was only divided into districts and counties, and the leaders were not yet fully sound. Since the winter of last year, the districts have been changed to provinces, and the organization of the province is said to be divided into eight administrative regions, governing more than 70 counties in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, and the Su-Wan Border Region Provincial Government has been established, and the administrative structure is becoming increasingly strict. Our people are suffering more and more, and will fall into a state of eternal damnation. However, because our government's banner is flying high in Nanjing, it is not comparable to being far away in Chongqing in the past. It is only separated from the Communist Party-occupied area by the Yangtze River, which is only a narrow strip of water. We believe that the danger is very great, and not only we refugees are suffering. I previously read in your newspaper's June 2nd issue the appeal of Lu Guojun, a representative from Taidong, for the people of Northern Jiangsu, and listed various items, all of which are facts and not rumors. If the government can send someone to investigate, they will be shocked and furious, and send troops to the north. Otherwise, north of the Yangtze River will be no different from Soviet territory, truly connected to the Soviet Union, and incurable. We are from Yancheng, formerly part of the Communist Party's Yancheng-Fuyu District, and now changed to the Fifth Administrative Region of the Border Region Government. The suffering from the Communist Party's ravages is similar to that of Taidong. What we have personally endured and what Lu of Taidong et al. have not fully stated are as follows: (1) Pretending to be public opinion. Whenever the Communist Party wants to do something, it must always pretend to be public opinion and hold meetings. People mistakenly believe that it is a democratic facade and discuss it carefully. As a result, those who speak on the spot are assassinated either on the same day or in two or three days, or they are charged with crimes and killed. In our Yancheng, such as Wu Jikang, Zhou Tiejun, Sun Yue, Lü Dacai, Qiao Yuebo, Liu Jiaqing, and Liu Yiqing, etc., are all important local gentry who were suddenly murdered. May I ask, who else dares to touch the dragon's scale again? This matter should be requested that Mr. Huang Yanpei and others go in person to thoroughly investigate the truth, so as not to be deceived by the Communist Party again. (2) Universal hunger. The Communist Party government has many ways to extract wealth from the people, and the result is that no family can have food. Landlords and gentry have no food to eat and cannot guarantee their lives in the morning or evening, but they can also be considered to have committed a crime worthy of death, while other people, such as businessmen, refugees, and tenant farmers, also have no food to eat and all die together. The Communist Party's collected land tax and public grain are full of pits and valleys. Is this what they call a democratic government? (3) Forced conscription. The Communist Party forcibly conscripts strong men, assigning one or two soldiers to each household, with many names, such as national soldiers, provincial soldiers, county soldiers, militiamen, stretcher teams, transport teams, and comfort teams. At this time, the strong men of our county, fearing their coercion and enticement, also fled together with the landlords and gentry, otherwise they would end up in ditches and gullies. (4) Encroachment on land. The Communist Party's strategy for encroaching on land is roughly divided into three types: (1) confiscation, (2) settling accounts, (3) opening rivers. With these three methods of encroaching on land, there is no piece of clean land left in the entire Northern Jiangsu. (5) Demolishing houses. In the Northern Jiangsu region, there are no less than tens of thousands of public temples, ancestral halls, city god temples, and land temples, all of which have been completely demolished by the Communist Party. Other residences, such as those of gentlemen Qiao Zhonglin, Hu Qidong, Ma Yongxu, Xu Chongda, Wu Yibai, and Hong Weiyang, etc., numbering no less than several hundred, have also been completely demolished by the Communist Party. In the four townships of our Yancheng, there is almost no residence left. The enemy and puppets in this place did not take such drastic actions. (6) Forcibly robbing miscellaneous items. The Communist Party ordered all bandits and hooligans to carry out a large-scale accounting strategy, first demanding grain from landlords, and if there was no grain in the house, they ordered the bandits and hooligans to rob all the stored miscellaneous items and clothes. (7) Humiliating women and children. The landlords and gentry were forced by the Communist Party to flee to the south of the Yangtze River one after another. The women and children left in Northern Jiangsu were forced by the Communist Party to organize women's salvation associations and children's corps, and village and town cadres forced them to parade, sing Yangko dances, and the cadres teased them at will. Who doesn't have women? Who doesn't have a family? There is nothing more destructive to etiquette. The children's corps were forced to race, and they often got injured on the spot, fainted immediately, or suffered from hemoptysis after running, which is innumerable. The Communist Party directly wants to eliminate our Northern Jiangsu people, and not only grabs our land and robs our miscellaneous items. All of this is what Lu Guojun, the representative of Taidong, and others have not mentioned. It is now heard that the Communist Party has signed an agreement with our government. We intend to appeal through your newspaper, and respectfully ask the government to give an order to the Communist Party troops to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu immediately, so that we can return to our hometown and live in peace, and we will be infinitely blessed. Wu Miao, Wei Weifu, Yi Shiyan, Liu Beilan, Qiao Riwu, Hong Hai, Zhao Yidong, He Qitong, representatives of the refugees from Yancheng in Xixi. June 11th.</p>
<h3>Important Views Published by the Hong Kong Media</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong media has begun to express their opinions on the incident of the "National Daily" being severely punished by the Hong Kong government. The "Sing Tao Daily" yesterday published an article titled "Promoting Sino-British Friendship," expressing "infinite sympathy" for the "National Daily's" "unexpected encounters in order to maintain national integrity and rectify national laws and regulations." The newspaper quoted the process of British and Japanese diplomacy towards China in our modern history, emphasizing the mistakes made by the Japanese, and "hoping that the enlightened British government and Hong Kong government, who respect history, can understand the psychology of the Chinese residents of Hong Kong, and even the feelings of the entire Chinese nation." The "Chinese Character Daily" also published an editorial today titled "Sino-British Cooperation and the National Daily." It is said that "After the war and after all kinds of lessons, the one million overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have now realized. Now it is definitely not as easy to be deceived and anesthetized as it was before the war." Finally, it said: "We do not want to have the slightest harm to the feelings of the two nations because of small things, and we do not want to have the slightest obstacle to the cooperation of the two nations because of the development of small things. We hope that the authorities will handle it properly as soon as possible." It is learned that other Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong will make representations in the coming days in order to maintain the status of our overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and reaffirm the friendship between the two major nations of China and Britain.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the Hong Kong government, when the Legislative Council met to discuss the sealing of the "National Daily," McDougall spoke the most. McDougall strongly advocated using the outdated 1938 Defense Act to support Cen Weixiu. Cen Weixiu's "Overseas Chinese Daily" has praised McDougall immensely in recent days. When McDougall was the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong, he made a remark of "deeply gratified to have found the right person." McDougall has recently sent many plainclothes detectives to protect Cen Weixiu and the "Overseas Chinese Daily," and has allocated a car specifically for Cen Weixiu to travel in and out. When Duo followed the British army back to Hong Kong (McDougall was the director of the London Intelligence Agency in Hong Kong before the war), it was rumored that Cen Weixiu had given him a large sum of money. McDougall also intends to protect other traitors in Hong Kong. The overseas Chinese in Hong Kong feel somewhat disappointed because our government officials stationed in Hong Kong have failed to adopt effective policies to maintain national discipline and boost morale, and have allowed traitors and villains to be arrogant.

<h3>The Various Circles of Guangzhou Protest to the Hong Kong Government Regarding the National Daily Incident</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 12th [of the month]</p>
<p>After eight long years of sacrificial struggle, we have recovered many of the territories we lost under unequal treaties. Perhaps only Hong Kong and Macau remain temporarily unrecovered for the sake of maintaining friendship. Unfortunately, one unfortunate incident after another has occurred precisely in these two places, especially in Hong Kong, often making us feel that the "friendship" we gained is repaid with others' "unfriendliness." Look, there have been many instances, such as Portuguese police officers in Hong Kong insulting and assaulting our national soldiers… These may be minor matters, and for the sake of the Sino-British friendship forged in times of shared life and death, who cares if we suffer a little? We are unwilling to quibble. However, the sensational Pingshan Airport incident has just passed, and another unfortunate event follows closely: recently, the Hong Kong National Daily was forced to suspend publication for a month simply for calling for the punishment of traitors. The arrival of this unfortunate news has left the people of Guangzhou astonished and indignant. The Hong Kong government sent a large contingent of police to the National Daily to carry out the order, intending to seal up the entire newspaper office. The newspaper's staff members said that if the main entrance was sealed, the large amount of lodging would become a problem. After repeated requests, they finally agreed to only seal the newspaper's office, typesetting room, machine room, and editorial department.</p>
<p>A Brief History of the National Daily's Struggle</p>
<p>As we all know, the Hong Kong National Daily is one of the overseas party newspapers directly under the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang. From its founding in 1939 until the last day of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in December 1941, it continued to publish. It is remembered that on December 25 of that year, at 4:00 PM, amidst the sounds of artillery fire, the British troops defending Hong Kong had completely surrendered, and the Japanese troops marched from Wan Chai to the Central district. However, at that time, the newspaper's staff, together with the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army led by General Chen Ce, still managed to distribute the newspaper on the morning of the 26th under heavy Japanese guard. They then burned the newspaper office on Pedder Street before retreating. This was something that all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong at the time knew. The newspaper's past spirit of upholding justice and its pronouncements were deeply loved by the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. After the victory, the newspaper resumed publication in Hong Kong under the order of the central government. At that time, our country's military delegation had formally notified the Hong Kong authorities, and the registration with the Hong Kong government was under the name of the Central Propaganda Department. Unexpectedly, this time, simply for calling for the punishment of traitors, in Hong Kong, a place regarded as governed by the rule of law, at a time when people around the world unanimously demand freedom of the press, the Hong Kong government, on trumped-up charges, without any legal procedure and without notifying any of our agencies, hastily ordered the newspaper to suspend publication for a month and even seal it up. This is not only unprecedented in the 105-year history of Hong Kong as a port, but also an unprecedented example in any democratic country!</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Hong Kong Government Regulations</p>
<p>What exactly is the content of the regulations cited by the Hong Kong government this time? The gist of the Defense Law promulgated by the Hong Kong government in 1922 states: "If a state of danger or emergency exists in Hong Kong, the Governor has the power to execute orders if any of the following conditions exist." The gist of Article 24 states, "No publication may incite people to not work or to break off relations with a certain shop." It is discovered that the order was promulgated after the Hong Kong General Strike, designed to prevent workers from striking. Is Hong Kong still in a state of danger or emergency today, when the world has declared peace? Moreover, in the past, when the Hong Kong government punished newspapers with suspension, the most serious incident, even in a state of emergency, did not result in a suspension of more than 27 days. This time, the most severe measures were taken for this incident, which shows that the Hong Kong government clearly has ulterior motives. In fact, according to another source, there is an inside story to this matter: because Cen knew that his crimes were numerous and he would certainly not escape the law of the country, he desperately flattered the ruling figures in the Hong Kong government, hoping to use the power of the British to cover him up. Therefore, the Hong Kong government had been paying attention to the National Daily's usual attacks on traitors and puppets, but this time they took decisive action. Of course, we still hope that this news is just a rumor; otherwise, the Hong Kong government's move would have the suspicion of protecting Cen and others!</p>
<p>The President of the Newspaper Reports the Matter Upon Arriving in Guangzhou</p>
<p>For this issue, the colleagues in the Hong Kong press originally wanted to unite to support the National Daily, but later everyone thought that after all, it was on other people's (?) territory. If they did not handle it well, they would likely suffer the same fate as the National Daily, so they had to find other methods and did not make any obvious expressions!</p>
<p>The president of the newspaper, Zhang Husheng, after the incident occurred, ran to Guangzhou to report the matter to the relevant authorities and appealed to the people of the country. The press here also felt that the Hong Kong government's unreasonable flogging of our colleagues was extremely infuriating.</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting to Decide on Various Matters</p>
<p>In addition to writing articles protesting the Hong Kong government, a joint meeting of the directors of three organizations, the Provincial and Municipal Reporters' Association and the Newspaper Industry Association, was held on the 12th of this month. It was decided that these three organizations would promote the convening of a general assembly of all circles in the city. The important resolutions at the time included: (1) Sending a telegram to the whole country, urging the government to sternly lodge a negotiation through normal diplomatic channels, and asking the people of the whole country to provide assistance. (2) Sending a telegram to people all over the world, appealing for condemnation of the Hong Kong government's destruction of freedom of the the press. (3) Following diplomatic channels to demand that the Hong Kong government immediately revoke the order to suspend the National Daily and punish the people responsible for handling this incident in the Hong Kong government. (4) While the Hong Kong government's unfriendly attitude toward our press exists, all promises from the Hong Kong authorities to assist the city's newspapers in purchasing newsprint and inviting the city's reporters to visit Hong Kong will be temporarily rejected. At that time, the entire atmosphere was激昂, with a sense of not giving up until the matter was resolved. Some even believed that for the sake of our territorial sovereignty, we should "recover Hong Kong!" In Guangdong, the birthplace of the revolution, there is actually a colony of another country, which is simply a disgrace to the people of Guangdong!</p>
<p>This time, the Hong Kong government, with this small matter, has taken such unreasonably severe measures against the representative agencies established by our government in Hong Kong. This is clearly a lack of respect for our government, which could easily erase our past friendship. Our last hope is that this is just the Hong Kong government's mistake, and not that of the British authorities.</p>
<h3>How Britain Solves the Food Shortage</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xueyan</p>
<p>London Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 4th [of the month]</p>
<p>Although Britain's food production is not enough to meet its needs, due to a good transportation system and sufficient preparation, it has surprisingly managed to avoid any embarrassment amidst the world's food shortage. Furthermore, it has made appropriate arrangements for all parts of the empire. For example, as far as the Far East is concerned, there is a need for food everywhere now, but Siam still has surplus rice. However, Siamese rice has long been designated by Britain as its exclusive preserve, only for the enjoyment of the people of the British Empire and not to be shared by other countries. As far as Britain's own food problem is concerned, the most thorny issue is the British-occupied zone in Germany. Although Britain is self-sufficient, it is still very difficult. It has no surplus strength to distribute to its former enemies. Therefore, the food supply in the British-occupied zone of Germany has been stretched thin since last winter and is difficult to cope with. The amount allocated has been reduced again and again, to the point where it can only barely sustain life. However, the result of reducing food is also a reduction in productivity. The problem caused by this is not simple. Unexpectedly, the food in the Soviet and American-occupied zones is very sufficient. Therefore, the businesses run by Germans in these two zones are far better than in the British-occupied zone. As a result of the Germans' psychological reaction, the problem gradually affected management, and the feeling that a way to compensate needs to be found is very urgent. First, of course, is to ask the British people to save more food. The amount of wheat used to make beer has been reduced, and the amount of rations distributed to soldiers has been reduced to be equal to that of civil servants. At the same time, a bread-saving campaign is being launched on a large scale by the Ministry of Food, with eye-catching slogans posted everywhere, urging people not to waste bread. However, it is inevitable that this type of passive measure will not have a great effect. Therefore, the Minister of Food, Ben Smith, went to the United States to discuss solutions. However, the atmosphere in the United States is clearly different from that in Britain. From the American perspective, when all of Europe is experiencing a food shortage, only Britain has reserves. It seems inappropriate for Britain not to distribute part of its stored food to relieve Europe, but instead to beg for aid from the United States. Therefore, Smith's mission clearly did not succeed. The British cabinet had no choice but to recently send Morrison, the government party leader in the House of Commons, to the United States. Morrison's mission has been completed in some sort of compromise.</p>
<h3>Sunday Forum: Do Not Sully the Essence of Democracy!</h3>
<p>— Miao Jie</p>
<p>"Democracy" is truly an ancient and yet novel term. Ever since Aristotle coined this term, it has been constantly shouted and roared about by people of various eras, from different standpoints, and with different meanings, soaring into the clouds. It seems that any action, as long as it is prefaced with the word "democracy" or invokes the name of the people, can be completely irresponsible. Beneath this guise of "democracy," countless sins have been concealed or fabricated, just as people have abused "freedom."</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen told us in the Three Principles of the People: "To learn from foreign countries, we must catch up from the front, not follow behind." This statement encompasses social, political, and cultural aspects. However, most reform experts and leaders today do not truly understand Sun Yat-sen's analogy, thinking that only in science must we catch up from the front, while in other aspects, we must recite or reenact foreign history. In fact, if we are determined to strive towards the goal of democracy in the right direction, we should first of all avoid the various disasters that have occurred in the process of "democratic politics" over the past few centuries and not repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p>The essence of "democratic politics" lies in using the good will of society, from the bottom up, to effectively control the will of the government. To put it plainly, it lies in using the people's will for the "common good" to govern the will of those few who hold the power of the state and implement governance. The people of a country number in the millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions. Among these millions of people, on the one hand, we cannot, like Rousseau or Durkheim, believe that society has a "public opinion" or "collective consciousness" that exists beyond the individual, nor can we, like general social contract theorists, believe that people can mutually grant protection and form a simple and unified will through concluding contracts. On the other hand, if every person should have equal opportunities to express their impulses, exercise their intelligence, and express their opinions, then how can the principle that the government's actions under "democracy" are based on (the government's will must encompass and integrate the will of the entire people) be achieved? There is usually a mistaken view that to realize the will of the group, one must suppress the will of the individual. In fact, this theory is illusory; what existence does a group have apart from individuals? If a university excludes all students and professors, all that remains is the name; nothing else exists. If it were possible for everyone to suppress their own will, whose will would become the will of the group? If everyone has no will, then there is no such thing as the will of the group. As long as the will of the individual does not override the will of others, the will of the individual will also and necessarily always be consistent with the will of the group. When the wills of millions of people converge in one place, they stimulate each other and adapt to each other, and in the process of harmonious coordination of human nature, the public good that benefits both oneself and others can be extracted from each will, synthesizing the greatest, final, and most comprehensive social goodwill. Therefore, the goodwill of society is nothing more than the "common good" that millions of people have tempered and condensed through various considerations and judgments. If this goodwill of society can in fact become the source of state law and the basis of government actions, then it is the true realization and completion of "democracy." However, this also simultaneously reveals that the success of "democracy" must rely on the two conditions of "rule of law" and "responsible politics." If the law is not respected for a single day, if it does not have power for a single day, then it cannot compel the few powerful rulers to comply with the goodwill of society. If the highest authorities that make up the government do not have a conscious responsibility for the results of their actions, there can be no guarantee that the goodwill of society will be carefully and properly implemented. That is to say, in a sound and complete "democracy," the people must not only be able to generate the goodwill of society but also be able to concentrate the power of the entire body as the final sanction entrusted to the government for the implementation of the social goodwill.</p>
<p>Although the meaning of "democracy" is not difficult to explain clearly, the spirit of "democracy" is extremely easy to be insulted, damaged, and even completely destroyed. Therefore, it is urgently necessary for us to identify and reject the various confusing and misleading regressive concepts of "anti-democracy" or "false democracy" that are currently prevalent.</p>
<p>First, "democracy" is not simply "majority rule." Under "democracy," it is never permissible for the will of one person in the people to be superior to the will of another person, or for the will of this person to be controlled by the will of that person. Everyone's will is equal, has the same value, and has equal opportunity for expression. The majority often knows social values and perceives social needs better than the minority, which can be proven by historical facts. It is also undeniable that the majority, through collective wisdom, often has more and higher intelligence. But if it is said that the majority should and must be superior to the minority, or that the interests of the minority must be sacrificed for the sake of the interests of the majority, this is devoid of logic. Ibsen, in his play "An Enemy of the People," stated: "The majority is always wrong, the minority is always right." Although this may be an overstatement, there is no reason why the wisdom and interests of the minority cannot be respected and protected. In a group of one hundred people, it cannot be that because ninety-nine people unanimously believe that another person must die, that person should be legitimately sentenced to death. Therefore, "people's courts" and the like are truly not worth emulating. The licentiousness of the majority is as worthy of condemnation as the tyranny of the minority!</p>
<p>Second, "democracy" should not be "mob rule." Aristotle, in his famous book "Politics," had already cleverly pointed out: "Mob rule is to democracy as tyranny is to enlightened monarchy." According to Aristotle, under "mob rule," what occupies the supreme position in the country is not the law but the ignorant masses; the commands of the masses must disregard the authority of the law, and those who are violent and arbitrary occupy the key positions of the state, and those who are greedy for profit and disregard righteousness invariably seize high positions and generous salaries. However, since the first French Revolution, followed by violent revolutions in some European countries, people seem to have become confused again, believing that "mob rule" is the climax of "democracy." This seems to be deliberately imitated in some places in China as well. However, in the eyes of social psychologists, mobs are nothing more than groups of crazy and blind animals! Every one of them has lost their own reason, relying only on emotional impulses, leading good people to hell and falling into the path of beasts. No wonder the British sociologist MacIver said: "Crowds are stupid, cruel, immoral, passionate, and easily agitated. Even if the passion of the crowd is used in the right place, it is nothing more than a group of fools; if it is used in the wrong place, it is simply a flood of savage beasts. It only knows how to make some simple and frightening roars, it only knows how to destroy, not how to build. Before Christ, it only chose Barabbas, the thief." Terrible! Unfortunately, this kind of politics has recently been seriously spreading across our country!</p>
<p>Third, "democracy" is definitely not "struggle politics." "Class struggle" and "direct action" are the specialties of Marxists and syndicalists. This poison can be said to be caused by the distortion and misunderstanding of Darwin's theory of the struggle for existence. Darwin inherited this term from Malthus, and it does not refer exclusively to the "hostility" and "competitive reaction" of organisms, but includes "the interdependence of animals," especially "the individual's life and the success of reproduction." Marx and Engels said in the Communist Manifesto in 1913: "The history of all past societies is the history of class struggles." This is clearly an absurd and dogmatic statement! No social organization can be clearly and absolutely divided into many opposing classes, and even Marx and Engels themselves did not have a clear analysis of social classes in their writings. Of course, there are often facts of conflict and antagonism between individuals and individuals, classes and classes in society, but this is definitely not a fundamental and universal phenomenon in society. Only social "cooperation" and "interdependence" are the most fundamental and most universal. If the forces of social separation exceed the forces of social harmony, then society would have collapsed and been destroyed long ago. Where would there be a battlefield for class struggle? And no class can indefinitely oppress or destroy other classes and survive safely for a long time. Since Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid" was published, people have been sure that human progress originates from "cooperation" and "interdependence," not from mutual hostility, antagonism, and jealousy. For example, the opposition between workers and factory owners, no matter how serious and sharp, is still superficial and relative. Whether workers or factory owners, both must rely on the other's cooperation to survive and prosper. If either party aims to overwhelm or destroy the other, the result will be the decline of production and the shrinkage of the economy, which is tantamount to suicide. The only question is how to reasonably and fairly distribute profits under the condition of mutual dependence. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen said that social progress is due to the harmony of the interests of all classes, not due to conflict, which is truly the truth.</p>
<p>Fourth, "democracy" is no longer "property politics." The beginning of "democracy" was indeed due to the expansion of the property of the middle class. Because the class that owns vast property naturally feels keenly aware of its relationship with the interests of the state in order to maintain the safety of its property, and having property also has the power to seek the development and enrichment of its personality. Therefore, the political interests of property owners are always relatively strong, and the demand to participate in politics is also relatively keen, eventually overthrowing monarchical autocracy and laying the cornerstone of "democracy." But this cannot lead to the conclusion that property must permanently control "democracy." Modern "democracy" enables everyone to have equal opportunities to participate in deciding the social goodwill of politics. However, since the talent and experience of individuals cannot be denied to have differences in level, the efforts and social value of individuals in political participation should also have differences in superiority and inferiority. However, those with property are not necessarily intelligent. There is no correlation between property and wisdom. Property is not necessarily due to the individual's efforts and value, and there is no proportional relationship between them. Therefore, property in "democracy" really has no basis to determine decisiveness and importance. If property is still influencing politics, the people cannot have equal opportunities. If property is still used as a standard for measuring the level of people, the effectiveness of individual personality has no social evaluation standard. Therefore, we must reject the concept of "property politics." But it is not to say that this can be achieved simply by a law stipulating that "everyone can acquire the qualifications of a citizen without being restricted by property." This always requires thoroughly clearing and fundamentally eliminating the direct and indirect forces and influences of property from the inner layer of politics.</p>
<p>Fifth, "democracy" is not necessarily "party politics." Whether it is British-American "democracy" or Continental-style "democracy," it seems that the implementation of modern "democracy" cannot be separated from "party politics." But this cannot prove that "democracy" must or must be "party politics." At most, it can only be said that at present, "party politics" is a relatively appropriate method of implementing "democracy." But this cannot be used to defend the various "party politics" that are currently prevalent, saying that all "party politics" are worthy of praise and admiration at the present time. A political party must be composed of true representatives of a group of people, and its roots must be deeply rooted in the inherent personality of a group of people. It is only a microphone for the people's will. It leads the people to promote themselves by appropriate methods. It stimulates the people's political interests and shows them how to supervise and how to judge the means of government actions. It should have no interests of its own party other than the interests of the people it represents. The party's struggle to seize power is only a reflection of the people's will to decide the government's actions. Only such "party politics" can be tolerated by "democracy." If a political party leaves the people or even betrays the people, the people will also abandon the political party. If a political party only cares about saying its own words, no longer conveys the will of the people, or does not even ask about the will of the people at all, then its criticism of the government is only venting its own personal anger and has nothing to do with the people. Its seizure of power is only for its own interests and does not benefit the people in any way. The result is nothing more than the formation of a multi-party distribution of spoils! What is said about "coalition government," what is said about "participation of all parties and factions in politics," if separated from the people, is more of a parasite of democracy than a lucky star of "democracy"!</p>
<h3>Social Services: Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Qiuping asks:</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a middle-aged woman, the mother of a girl. My marriage was arranged by my parents, marrying me to my current husband as a concubine. My parents were also helpless because he used his power to force the marriage. Although I was a child at the time, I had a deep negative impression in my mind. However, because of the separation, I lived through it vaguely for several years, simply a nominal couple. I have asked him for a divorce several times, but not only did he not respond, he even scolded me slowly. He has always held the attitude of insulting women. I still remember the slogan of the March 8th Women's Day, "Long live women" and "Down with officials taking concubines," which made me infinitely happy and sympathetic, because I am an unfortunate person who has experienced it firsthand and a pitiful person who has lost the meaning of life. Therefore, I have to issue a call to the ladies and ask for help from the gentlemen. May I ask: (1) Under his sinister influence, what methods should be taken to divorce in order to ensure safety? (2) After the divorce, who will raise the child, and are there any regulations on education expenses? (3) Is it possible to preserve personal savings? (4) If a divorce is not possible, what crime should I commit under the law if I run away privately? (5) If he uses murder to deal with me during an argument, what crime does he commit?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin]: (1) The relationship between a husband and a concubine cannot be considered a marital relationship. Therefore, if you want to break away from cohabitation, the divorce regulations under the law do not apply. You can request it in accordance with Article 1127 of the Civil Code. As for ensuring safety, it is a matter of fact and should be handled accordingly. (2) The children born to a concubine are "illegitimate children." Their relationship with their biological mother is regarded as legitimate children and does not need to be recognized. If they are recognized by their biological father, the biological father should also be responsible for education. There are no specific regulations on education expenses. (3) If it is your own property, it can be preserved. (4) An adult family member can leave the family. If there is no other criminal behavior, it is not a crime. (5) It is the crime of murder.</p>
<p>(1) Hua Xiaoping asks: I was born in Wuxi. I have been doing business in Shanghai for 20 years. In my hometown, besides my 70-year-old mother, I also have an older brother who is now 45 years old. He does not do his job properly and associates with bad people. Before the war, my mother reported him for harming his direct relatives, and he served six months. His temperament has not changed. He does not cultivate the ancestral fields and hangs around in teahouses every day, gambling. Next door to us is the ancestral two-room foundation of my uncle. My uncle was drafted by the enemy during the war and has not been heard from until now. He is probably no longer alive. So, a legal issue of stealing and selling has arisen. May I ask: (1) Can my brother establish the status of seller? (2) If my uncle's descendants do not exist, can I establish the status of plaintiff? (3) Is stealing and selling other people's property a civil or criminal offense? Which article? (4) Does the Land Rights Clearing Law formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government apply? (5) The pseudo-township chief committed bad deeds during the enemy and puppet period, such as forcibly requisitioning military grain, ordering road maintenance, swallowing military rice, smoking opium, and bullying the people. Must he be reported separately? Can it be heard in this case as an incidental appeal? (6) If I file a lawsuit in the Wuxi court, and the plaintiff lives in Shanghai, can the summons be sent to Shanghai? Sincerely, Hua Xiaoping</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin]: (1) Your brother has no right to sell. (2) If your brother and your uncle are within five degrees of kinship or relatives living together, you have no right to sue; otherwise, you can report it. (3) If there is indeed an act of seizing other people's real estate, it can constitute the crime of Article 320, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. (4) The Land Clearing Law formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government can be used, but this case must be able to prove that it is indeed an illegal sale, and the contract is invalid. (5) If the pseudo-township chief has the crime of traitor, he should be reported separately, and the High Court is the first instance. (6) If the plaintiff lives in Shanghai, the summons can be entrusted to be served. Except for the necessity of the person appearing in court, you can entrust a lawyer to act as an agent.</p>

<h3>Water and Soil</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>There is such a story in "Yanzi":</p>
<p>When Yanzi was in Chu, the king made Yanzi drink. When the drinking was at its height, two officials tied a man to the king. The king said: Who is the bound man? He replied: A Qi person, sitting for stealing. The king looked at Yanzi and said: Are Qi people good at stealing? Yanzi avoided his seat and replied: I have heard that oranges grow in Huainan and become oranges, but they grow in Huaibei and become trifoliate oranges. The leaves are similar, but the taste is different. What is the reason for this? The water and soil are different. Now, the people who grow up in Qi do not steal, but they steal when they enter Chu. Could it be that the water and soil of Chu make the people good at stealing?</p>
<p>Encountering I don't know how many friends who came to Shanghai, they rushed away after finishing their affairs. When asked afterwards, the answers were consistent: "I can't stand it." The meaning contained in the three words "I can't stand it" is very rich, it can be understood without words. As for the friends who are stuck in Shanghai and cannot slip away, they have to bear it even if they can't bear it.</p>
<p>In the past few days, MPs and SPs have been arresting mobile glass cabinet stores on the road, and vendors have a lot of complaints, thinking that the most aggrieved are non-military supplies, which were also swept away by these foreign adults.</p>
<p>In fact, even if it is military supplies, the good vendors are still wronged, because they did not go deep into the barracks or swim to climb the warships to steal them.</p>
<p>Some time ago, an American sailor escaped after robbing and resisting arrest by firing a gun. To be honest, when they were stark naked (there is a cartoon, drawing them returning home stark naked) and could not return home, they could do anything to eat without paying, strip pigs at night, rob, and do anything. In the middle of the night, the sharp ghost howling of the MP and SP patrol jeep on the road is just a sign that the days are not very peaceful. The vendors use US dollar bills to buy the small odds and ends they need to sell, probably not guilty!</p>
<p>Alas! The water and soil of Shanghai treats Chinese and foreigners equally.</p>
<h3>The Life of a Dance Hall Employee</h3>
<p>— Cao Yu</p>
<p>I am a dance hall employee. In the minds of most people, dance halls are generally seen with prejudice and misunderstanding. It seems that everything in a dance hall is vile, shameless, and indecent, whether it is the dance hall itself, the dancers, or the general employees (including head waiters, waiters, accountants, etc.). The dance hall is seen as a den of iniquity, a source of depravity, and a stopover for licentiousness. Perhaps in reality, some employees are indeed dominated and swayed by the environment; but it is too much to force this dirty hat on the head of every employee. In fact, many of us are unwilling to be part of the muck. The only reason we go to dance halls is because we are driven by the whip of life, and probably no other more certain reason can be found.</p>
<p>Heavy with Sleepiness　Most people think that our life in this atmosphere must be pleasant and joyful, because we are immersed in the fragrant air and the world of charming songs all day long. But who can understand or sympathize with the suffering we endure? For the sake of business, while others are snoring in sweet dreams, we are just starting to get busy. When others have already worked half the day after the sun has risen high, we just get up, heavy with sleepiness. Every day from 2:30 PM to 11:30 PM, there are actually nine hours of work, with no chance to breathe except during dinner time. Even a common laborer doesn't work so hard! With all this, isn't our spirit already suffering enough?</p>
<p>If someone asks us how our treatment is, it's better not to say: the salary we directly receive from the boss is so little it's practically nothing. But the extra tips we get in the name of employees are partly taken away by the boss. Unless you experience it yourself, outsiders may find it hard to believe.</p>
<p>Treating Everyone Equally　Some people even want us to fill out some kind of survey form. It is said that the purpose of filling out this form is to issue dance hall employee service permits in the future. There are several almost ridiculous items in it, including "Whether you have the consent of your parents or husband?" "Whether you have a contract to sell yourself?" "Whether you have been seduced and lost your virginity?" Good heavens! Not every employee is a dancer. This must be a joke to us. In fact, we are men, so how could we have husbands, and what about "contracts to sell ourselves, seduction and loss of virginity"? We really don't understand how these could apply to us.</p>
<p>And there are some gentlemen who often come to dance halls, not to sell overdue weekly magazines, but to force the sale of so-called American glass combs that sell for eight or nine hundred yuan on the market, but they want two thousand yuan each. Often, they come to the dance hall to dance under the pretext of investigation. Eating for free is even more common. Sometimes, if the waiter is a little slow or not attentive enough, a scolding is unavoidable. It's lucky if they don't get beaten! When the boss sees it, he will immediately come over to apologize and scold the waiter for no reason, because they are "officials"! Isn't this enough? Please, gentlemen, stop looking at us with discriminatory eyes! You can know that dance hall employees are also capable of "doing certain things and not doing others." "The lotus seed has bitterness in its heart," who will sympathize?</p>
<p>News Small World</p>
<h3>Dozens of Mysterious Concubines in the Inner宅 of "Emperor Ma" in Tianjin</h3>
<p>The "One Heart Heavenly Dao Longhua Holy Religion Society" in Tianjin was recently banned by the authorities. The head of the society, "Emperor Ma," and his deputy, Tao Yunxiang, along with forty-five young and beautiful female members, fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>The "One Heart Heavenly Dao Longhua Holy Religion Society" originated in Dingwang Village, Changshan, Shandong. Its "founder," Ma Shiwei, courtesy name Guanying, was a local rogue who was restless. Later, he had a whimsical idea to claim himself emperor, creating a heaven and using unorthodox methods to mislead the villagers. The society has more than 100,000 members, half male and half female (note: the beauty lies in the fact that it is half male and half female), with the most in Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi.</p>
<p>According to police statistics, since August of last year, thirty-seven "imperial concubines" who faded away like fragrant jade have been taken out of this "imperial palace," and they all "coincidentally" died of "septicemia."</p>
<p>It is also said that "Emperor Ma" claimed to be the "Second Crown Prince of the Jade Emperor descending to earth," and his "subjects" called him "Buddha Seat," "Father Lord," or "Emperor." Outsiders only knew him as "Ma the Benefactor" or "Ma the Religious Leader."</p>
<p>The Heavenly Law Society was moved to No. 47 Yangjia Garden during the period of occupation, and it was wide and beautifully decorated, its magnificent appearance like a palace. All the personnel in the society were members, and no outsiders were allowed to enter. Even the constables, rickshaw pullers, tilers, carpenters, tailors, and cooks were all handled by people from the society, like a small world. The inner residence of the head of the society was especially mysterious and magnificent, with dozens of beautiful women, who were the concubines of "Emperor Ma."</p>
<p>In addition to widely recruiting disciples, appointing ministers, and accepting concubines, "Emperor Ma" also arbitrarily changed the calendar, setting one month to forty-eight days and one year to eighteen months. Members all grew their hair and beards, wore tall hats with left-fastening lapels, and were as weird as possible.</p>
<p>It is said that once the Deputy Mayor of the Social Bureau, Director Hu, came to the society to inspect, and happened to encounter a Peach Banquet being held in this palace. Du Hu inquired whose birthday it was, and the deputy head of the society, who was called "Imperial Father-in-Law," replied, "It's the good day of the Wuji Holy Mother." The subjects said it was "Daddy's birthday," and the concubines said it was "Her Majesty's birthday." The answers were completely contradictory, putting these two wise officials in a quandary.</p>
<h3>On Hua Xiren</h3>
<p>— Cao Zuohan</p>
<p>The persona of Hua Xiren in *Dream of the Red Chamber* is somewhat like the common archetype of the traitors who have been arrested now.</p>
<p>When she was a maid, she lost her virginity to Bao Erye, which was out of necessity; Mother Jia originally wanted her to take good care of Bao Erye, so she should have yielded. After Bao Erye became a monk, she left the Grand View Garden and the Jia family, and also left her own elder brother and sister-in-law's house, which was also out of necessity, because she did not want to implicate others because of herself. Finally, she married Jiang Yuhan to be a young mistress, which was still out of necessity; how could she lightly brush aside a good intention? In the continued dream of the Red Chamber, it is written that she reunited with Bao Erye, which was probably out of necessity; because of deep affection, one day of love brings a hundred days of kindness, and the Hua girl cannot be an unrighteous wife.</p>
<p>What are the faces of the traitors who are being interrogated now like? Some say: it is because the whip of life is unbearable: this is out of necessity. Some say: it is because of the enemy's kidnapping and coercion, unable to straighten their backs in front of bayonets, this is also out of necessity. Some say that in order not to let the people in the recovered areas suffer, and in order to save people, they plunged into the muddy water, with a compassionate wish and the spirit of "I will not go to hell, who will go to hell," this is even more out of necessity. Some say that they were in the camp of Cao but their heart was in Han, some were Su Wu herding sheep for seven or eight years... In short, becoming a traitor is because it is out of necessity.</p>
<p>Not only is it out of necessity, but they are also doing "underground work"!</p>
<p>The concept of chastity for women in the era of *Dream of the Red Chamber* and the national ideology of modern people are equally important. It is a small matter to starve to death, but a great matter to lose one's chastity. Therefore, Xiren is ultimately a promiscuous woman, she became a traitor to etiquette, and traitors are the scum of humanity, they became traitors to the nation, and they should all be spurned.</p>
<p>The above is a discussion of the two; now let's discuss Xiren specifically.</p>
<p>Speaking of the matter itself, she is also a tragic and pitiful person. First, let's talk about her loss of virginity. The title of the fifth chapter of *Dream of the Red Chamber* boldly reveals "Jia Baoyu First Tries the Joy of Clouds and Rain." This word "try" shows that she was innocently made Bao Erye's love experiment, just for the enjoyment of the young masters, and the Second Master did not have any real feelings for her. However, she herself should at least bear three points of fault for this unfortunate event. Because she knows more about things than Bao Erye, and she seems to have a slight intention of seduction. Beginning lightly, the ending is naturally hasty. The scene of the collapse of the tree and the scattering of the monkeys can be imagined on the evening of the engagement.</p>
<p>The reason why she pleases so much is just like the young ladies in the public house flattering the young masters, and the young ladies in the social scene flirting with the young masters: they are sick with vanity.</p>
<p>Those who pursue vanity will never get vanity, and those who are enthusiastic about vanity will be destroyed by vanity. It is really a rare miracle to be able to get along well with unequal status. Because you are doing your best, and he is still indifferent, when he gives you a little bit of leftovers, you are already flattered. The one who suffers is still the person below. Alas, the disease of vanity cannot be eliminated. It is really helpless, alas, it is really harming many people.</p>
<p>Let's talk about her changing her chastity again. She is not a member of Bao Erye's house, and she has not gone through a clear path. Basically, there is no chastity to keep, which is said from a formal point of view. In essence, the Second Master no longer loves her, so he became a monk, "Since you have no affection, I will also rest," who should she keep chastity for?</p>
<p>So her marriage, as it is said now, is really not worth discussing. What I find strange is that there are quite a few loyal dogs of a family now, and the master may not even treat them as well as Xiren, but they are stern and righteous, with an icy face. I really don't know who they are keeping chastity for? I am afraid it is still for the future job, maybe they want to flatter and seek his favor.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>In the June 12th issue of this column, "Four Poems of Martyrdom by Three Loyalists in the Late Ming Dynasty," the character "屈" (qu, bend) in the sentence "戰關河志未屈" (zhan guan he zhi wei qu, fighting the Guanhai River, the will has not bent) was mistakenly printed as "舒" (shu, extend) by the typesetter. Also, in the annotation, "家玉常乘一黃馬，神駿趨捷，"(Jiayu often rides a yellow horse, divine and swift) the character "神" (shen, divine) was mistaken as "黃" (huang, yellow). Also, the author was Mr. Zhang Baiyuan, which was also omitted. We hereby correct it.</p>

<h3>Banana</h3>
<p>— You Xin</p>
<p>I haven't tasted bananas, or even seen the color of bananas, for eight years. This time, I fled to Shanghai from the rear like an escape, and the first time I saw bananas, I had an incredible love for them. Ah! Banana, your color is so lovely yellow, your fragrance is also unparalleled in nature, banana, if I had a lover as beautiful as a flower, I would rather abandon her, I can use all the tenderness of loving her for you. If I had dazzling gold, I would rather exchange it for banknotes to exchange for you. But, banana; I am a poor boy, gold bars have big eyes, it never walks into my pocket.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in a fruit store on Nanjing Road, I saw your beautiful face again, banana, I seemed to see your eyeballs staring at me hard, you kept waving to me. My heart was pounding constantly, and my face was flushed. I knew you loved me, I am not grass, trees, iron or stone, the fire of youthful love is burning me so uncomfortably. I secretly took out the banknotes from my pocket with trembling hands. Good heavens! Only one hundred yuan left! I wanted to cry, but I didn't have a drop of tears, but I dare to swear to you, I love you, I will always love you, but I'm afraid I can't afford to buy you!</p>
<p>I did not despair and shyly entered the door of the fruit store. A proud clerk greeted me. He looked me up and down with searching eyes and asked: "</p>
<p>"Sir, what do you want to buy?"</p>
<p>"I want to buy bananas, how much does one cost?" I then asked him.</p>
<p>"At least two hundred yuan, how many do you want to buy?"</p>
<p>"Too small! I don't want to buy them!" I felt that my tone of voice sounded strangely pitiful.</p>
<p>"Small? We have big ones! Are you buying them or not?" He was a little impatient.</p>
<p>"I'm not buying!" I shook my head shamefully, looked at the end of the bunch of bananas one last time, and hurriedly left the store door, heartbroken, only wanting to cry, my eyes seemed to be afraid to open, fearing that someone in this world would see me.</p>
<p>Alas! Goodbye, banana, goodbye for now. Maybe you won't understand me, because I made you feel disappointed. But I still ask for your forgiveness. When I receive my June royalties, I will come to visit again! Goodbye...</p>
<h3>Eating Chili Sauce</h3>
<p>— Leng Feng</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that the monthly income of friends who are civil servants, even the big shots in the bamboo character head class, is far less than that of a rickshaw puller wearing rags. However, this cannot be generalized; because those who always sit in the office only get a fixed salary, which is of course far less than the income of a rickshaw puller; if your job has outside duties, or you are in charge of general affairs and accounting, there is naturally another way to make money, so friends who sit in the office, cannot help but be jealous of these money-making experts. However, this jealousy cannot be a frontal conflict, so what can you do? Friends who hold a pen are somewhat artistic in their way of speaking, so there is the following conversation.</p>
<p>At the dinner table, everyone was picking at a chili sauce dish with their chopsticks. Mr. A spat out a few bones in front of him and said, "How is it that this kitchen is really good at making things, there is no meat in it, I am always eating bones."</p>
<p>Mr. B then said, "You don't have the ability, you can only eat some bones, the meat has already been eaten by others."</p>
<p>Mr. C also said with a smile, "This is too unfair, those who eat meat eat meat, and those who eat bones eat bones."</p>
<p>Mr. D also came to say, "It's not bad that you have some bones to eat. I don't even have the luck to eat bones, I can only find dried tofu."</p>
<p>There were eight people sitting at a table, four of whom said this, and the other four, some pretended not to hear and continued to put white rice in their mouths, and some did not speak, but showed a knowing smile on their faces.</p>
<p>Whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, the whole society is like this.</p>

<h3>Please Open the Bedbug's Mouth and Eat Two Bites of DDT</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Ma Weiliang, a lieutenant adjutant of the Receiving Japanese Military Supplies Committee of the Former Third Front Army, forcibly occupied the house of Liang Muru, a Cantonese woman in a garden villa on Huanlong Road, Shanghai, and then topped it off with forty taels of gold; after Liang moved to the Verdun Garden on Yarepe Road, she was again evicted and occupied by Ma, and all her furniture and clothes were occupied, resulting in being sued and detained; Commander Tang ruled that Ma had ruined military discipline and punished him according to the regulations on punishing corruption, and he was tied to Wuxi Station for execution at noon on the 11th. If it is said that killing one to warn a hundred, then I hope to cut off Ma's head and send it to Shanghai first, and show it in the Hongkou area for a few days, and then transport it to Tianjin and Beijing and other places for a tour. Even if there is not much effect, it is good to let the people feel happy.</p>
<p>After being sunk for several years, there are many places of road damage in Shanghai, so when riding a rickshaw on the road, when encountering road damage, you have to twist and avoid it; at first, I thought the rickshaw puller was afraid that the customer could not bear the decadence, so he was especially careful; later I learned that the reason was that the rickshaw company stipulated that if the tires were damaged, the person renting the car would have to pay for the repairs. The twisting and avoiding is only for oneself, and there is no intention to please the customer. But unconsciously, it has already achieved the point of "benefiting others and benefiting oneself".</p>
<p>Four thousand bags of rice from the Hong Kong "General Association" went missing. It is learned that the authorities are investigating everywhere in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and as a result, they have been found in two rice stores. That's good! That's good! The stolen goods are still there, and fortunately they have not been snatched away by the people; if they were snatched away by the refugees, wouldn't they have been divided and eaten long ago, how could they be able to hang up the stolen goods again.</p>
<p>The Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau tested the efficacy of DDT, and used a quilt cloth dipped in DDT to wrap a live bed bug. After two hours of viewing, it was still unharmed. I think it would be better to open the bed bug's mouth and feed it some DDT, and see if it can still survive?</p>
<p>Going to the volcano to find excitement, gambling is also to find excitement, and the result is likely to be ruined and bankrupt; on the contrary, injecting a vaccine can prevent cholera, and it can also be said to be a kind of excitement, why are people afraid and unwilling to get vaccinated?</p>

<h3>In Memory of Mr. Yu Shangyuan</h3>
<p>— Cao Bi</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Tao Xiong's "Remembering Mr. Yu Shangyuan" in a Shanghai newspaper, I couldn't help but recall my own impressions: that adorable old man! He must have white hair now.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy for him to manage the drama school for ten years; especially after the school moved to Jiang'an, it was a difficult period. He couldn't find teachers or recruit students. However, despite the harsh environment, he remained optimistic and persevered through the arduous stage in Jiang'an. Such diligence paid off; it created glorious achievements, and soon he received commendation from the education authorities. The school was upgraded to a specialized institution, transforming from a three-year vocational school to a five-year college, truly "deserving of the name!" There was another difficult matter in Jiang'an: everyone clamored to move! In the end, he gave everyone a clever conclusion, saying, "To successfully move, first, we must improve our school." Under this directive, everyone stopped talking about moving and focused on their studies, as if their competition was the Chongqing Opera School in Beibei. As a result, this effort earned victory; the education authorities requested him to move to Beibei and close down the Chongqing Opera School. In order to train even more outstanding talents, he formulated the 'Three-Three System,' dividing into elementary, middle, and advanced levels for a continuous nine years, so that from childhood, they would be imbued with theatrical knowledge, thus training drama talents without bad habits, and correctly achieving the so-called "genius education" goal of drama. I hereby wish him success in this new system.</p>
<p>His success in running the school also came from a spirit of freedom. I think no school was more free than the drama school. Publishing newspapers, holding discussion forums, literary soirees... almost every week, providing students with more opportunities for research, observation, and practice. He was always among the first to arrive at these events, as he considered them just as important as regular classes.</p>
<p>His age was far from ours, but his spirit stood with us. He was unpretentious and easygoing, able to talk to anyone, and everyone was his friend; whether a worker or the Minister of Education. He once said: "Our school doesn't get as much funding as XX school because I can't even sit halfway on a stool when talking to the minister."</p>
<p>His vitality was so strong that wherever he was, he could create a happy environment and joyful events. For example, when watching a play, he would say: "You should learn from me; no matter how bad the play is, you have to appreciate it properly, don't just criticize it with Aristotle's theories at the first touch." Yes, correct criticism should indeed begin with appreciation!</p>
<p>He thought about drama even when smoking. "Pure tobacco leaf" inspired him to invent many "gadgets". For example, "Drama Cakes," which were eaten during the annual Drama Festival, had a comedy mask on them. Eating them felt like eating mooncakes on the Mid-Autumn Festival... And the nationally-implemented performance tax started when he directed "The Inspection Commissioner." In Jiang'an, there were no electric lights, only gas lamps for performances. Because there was no way to control them, he instructed Huang Yuehan, a fourth-term student, to create a lamp controller for gas lamps, which was the "Yuehan Lamp," famous for a time in the theater world. Now, many touring theater groups are imitating the "Yuehan Lamp" for performances in rural areas. Also, when the students were eating too poorly, he thought of "Watching Plays with Goods," and the entrance of the theater was like a vegetable market, piled with "nutrition".</p>
<p>However, he pondered even more deeply about drama, thinking about how to align it with the times. This can be seen from several articles: one is "Sending Drama to the Countryside," and the other is "Sending Drama Back to the Barracks." Consequently, half of the drama school students enlisted in the army, ranking first among all schools nationwide in terms of the proportion of students joining the military.</p>
<p>His knowledge was profound. In his 25-year drama career, he founded the Drama Department of the National Beiping Art School, as well as the Beiping Little Theater and the Chinese Drama Society. He published "Drama Journal," "Crescent Moon," and "Study Literature." He taught at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Jinan University, and Guanghua University. In 1935, he was hired by the Ministry of Education to conduct research in Europe. He also served as the manager of "Crescent Moon Bookstore," and he directed plays such as "The Merchant of Venice," "The Inspection Commissioner," "Othello," and "The Wild Duck." He wrote plays such as "The Statue" and "Military Mutiny," and he translated "The Admirable Crichton." He also wrote "Notes on Conversations with Gordon Craig and Stanislavski," and he acted in "Oppression." He has such accomplishments, perhaps because he studied at Carnegie University and Columbia University in the United States. However, he honestly told us: "During his studies, he had to borrow light from the latrine to study hard."</p>
<p>But now he is busy with administration all day, and he barely has time to read the newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Shangyuan is forty-nine years old this year, with white hair, but he still spares no effort for drama education. He said that the purpose of living is for the sake of future generations. He sees students as his children, who will continue his drama career. He believes that "the meaning of life lies in creating succeeding lives in the universe," which is his life philosophy. In his study, he always carries a hanging scroll, which he often gazes at, and often recites with a smile:</p>
<p>"Love the country, love drama, love the alma mater, love classmates!"</p>
<h3>General Review of Shanghai Spoken Drama, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>Four. "Story of a Mountain City"</p>
<p>This is a play performed by the Hard Work Theater Troupe. The director of this play is the same director as "Model of All Teachers," and the playwright is also the same playwright as "Model of All Teachers." Two of the actors are also from "Model of All Teachers." Therefore, it makes us wonder why its completeness and seriousness are not the same as "Model of All Teachers." The acting of the actors is also not as uniform as "Model of All Teachers." This may be because the director did not seriously take responsibility, or perhaps there was no connection between the actors. Therefore, a few of the actors stand out.</p>
<p>The most satisfying actor is Ma Xiaonong playing Aunt Mo. The most obvious scene that we can specifically point out is: after Cai Hongshan sent Xiang Tianhe to the warehouse, he called Guan Dayuan again. Lizhu knew that Xiang Tianhe would be caught, so she bribed Aunt Mo to chase him back. As soon as she left, Cai Hongshan came to look for her. Because she was not there, he asked Aunt Mo. Aunt Mo was counting the money that Lizhu gave her. As soon as she saw Cai coming, she quickly hid the money behind her back. At first, she did not say anything, but stammered. Later, because Cai took out a pistol to threaten her, she panicked and told him that Lizhu had gone to the warehouse. As soon as Cai Hongshan heard this, he chased after her. Only then was Aunt Mo relieved and started counting her money, and she showed the eighteen yuan that Lizhu gave Tianhe. Here, she was secretly paying attention to Lizhu, showing her panic when she saw Cai Hongshan's pistol, her hesitation when Lizhu gave her money, her hesitation when Cai asked her, and finally the joy of counting the money. She expressed all of them well, and completely grasped the character of this short-sighted and unintelligent woman and created the outer shape.</p>
<p>Secondly, Shi Hui playing Cai Hongshan, being able to act out all his ruthlessness, is also not an easy thing. For example, he wrote a check to Xiang Tianhe, but Tianhe refused it, so he was furious. He suddenly raised his voice in anger, and in the midst of turning around, he slapped the piano board with his palm. This made his anger and the atmosphere of the rich man come to life. Afterwards, because of Lizhu's persuasion, he said when he walked to the door:</p>
<p>"Think about it, the check is here." This scene can be said to be the most wonderful part of the whole play.</p>
<p>Again, there is Shen Yang who plays Han Er. This character is a young master from a scholarly family in the past, but now he is a down-and-out man who can't do anything. He only knows how to play the flute, drink wine, and play with potted plants. Perhaps he liked to play with watches when he was young, so he can still repair watches now. When he is drunk, he will also act crazy. He is completely a self-proclaimed elegant person and an upper-class person who has been poisoned. Because of this, he has become a useless person in society. Shen Yang grasped these parts and brought his entire excellent acting skills into play. He brought this kind of character vividly before the audience. For example, he is afraid of Xiang Shouzhi. When he is drunk, he wants Shouzhi to play with potted plants with him, but Shouzhi accidentally breaks the potted plant. This is the thing he cherishes the most. Even if someone offered him a high price of 100,000, he would not sell it. Now that it is broken, he does not dare to quarrel with Shouzhi, but shouts and walks outside. Coincidentally, he is hit by a car and brought back. Shen Yang completely controlled this character, consistently without being excessive or insufficient in any way, and acted it out.</p>
<p>Other actors are also very competent, but it is a pity that the level is not uniform enough.</p>
<p>Among the performances of Hard Work, this play can be compared with "Jin Xiaoyu."</p>
<p>Five. "Thunderstorm"</p>
<p>This script has been out for almost twenty years, and it is called a life-saving play. No matter which theater troupe is losing money and cannot continue to support itself, as long as it performs it, it can continue to exist. I remember when I was in Anshun County, Guizhou last year, the Guofeng Theater Troupe of the Military Medical School lost money in two performances. The person in charge was very anxious because the performance fees for both performances were advanced by the government and had to be repaid when they were due. Later, someone suggested performing "Thunderstorm." Sure enough, this play not only recovered the money lost, but also had surplus money to do the next performance. Therefore, I am even more convinced that "Thunderstorm" is a life-saving play.</p>
<p>"Thunderstorm," which is currently being performed at the Grand Theater in Shanghai, is not an official public performance by that theater troupe, but a group of famous actors gathered together for a blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>There is no director's name in the performance of this play, nor are there words such as collective director. Looking at the performance, the background of the dance and the movement of the actors are indeed terribly bad!</p>
<p>In the scenery, we can clearly see many drawn lines and shapes. Therefore, it makes us feel very fake.</p>
<p>Among the actors, the one who is least able to show the character is the one who plays Zhou Chong. He is wearing a double-breasted modern suit and white shoes with black trim. Just from these, he is not a Zhou Chong. Secondly, Zhou Ping is a pale and weak person, but the actor's agile movements and loud voice give us a character who is not Zhou Ping. And the actor who plays Lu Gui is showing off a little trick here, causing laughter from the audience. What is most strange is that in the third act, when Lu Dahai asks him for money to return to Zhou Chong, the actor says the three sentences of "No, no, no, give." in the same tone and the same voice. This naturally caused laughter from the audience, but it is not very suitable for the character. I seem to remember that the script did not have these words.</p>
<p>The actresses are much more serious than the actors. They did not play any small tricks in the play. However, there are also more serious actors among the male actors, that is, Qiao Qi, who plays Zhou Puyuan.</p>
<p>This script seems to have been changed a lot. These changes are for the performers to cater to the audience's low-level interests. But it only damages part of the script. The original</p>
<p>This play is quite successful commercially, but there are many problems with its artistic achievement. In a nutshell, commercial success cannot make up for one ten-thousandth of the artistic failure. In the performance, besides the script, there is only the actors' magic weapon. So some people say: this performance is just "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own divine powers." These divine powers are not noble acting, but low-level tricks. But it cannot be denied that only a few actors are more serious!</p>
<p>Six. "The New Official Takes Office"</p>
<p>This play was formerly named "Demons Dance in Chaos," and it was published in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. Because the current political stage has such bad behavior of officials, this play has not lost its meaning and timeliness. It describes an empty city under the control of the enemy, where a group of rogues and ruffians pretend to be new officials to take office. The style after taking office is to oppress the people and sell prohibited goods. As a result, the people attacked the city and captured them alive.</p>
<p>In the play, Chen Wanxing seduces Liu Dianyuan's concubine, Aunt Sun, in the first scene. Therefore, in the last scene, Aunt Sun tells Chen Wanxing the news that Liu Dianyuan is selling arms, which causes the two sides to turn against each other, causing Liu Dianyuan to kill Aunt Sun, and Chen Wanxing to move a bayonet. The cause and effect of this section is only briefly outlined in the first act of the script, and Chen Wanxing and Aunt Sun's affairs are not clarified in the other acts. And the director did not bring them together in the position to imply the relationship between the two sides. Therefore. It is very incredible to say that Aunt Sun leaked the news, which may be the director's negligence.</p>
<p>Among the actors, the image captured by Zong You is relatively obvious: wearing a fire-colored jacket without buttoning it, or hanging the jacket on his arm, inserting a long folding fan into his collar, and holding a birdcage in his hand, he looks like a rogue. However, the tone of speech is a bit slow, as if it is too "gentle".</p>
<p>Luo Yu, who plays Little Cabbage, can act out the "I don't care" look of a prostitute without leaving a trace. When she is quiet, she seems too lazy to move; when she is moving, she immediately waves her hands aggressively and fights with Aunt Sun. When Liu Er wants to molest her, she simply pulls open her collar and exposes her chest for the other party to stab. These actions vividly outline the character of a prostitute and introduce it to the audience. It really brings this character to life.</p>
<p>Fang Bo plays Chen Wanxing. The first point that can be praised is: he is a fat actor, but he did not use his appearance to use a bad low-level humorous trick to attract the audience, but seriously used his noble performance to make the audience pay attention to him. He plays a butcher in the play. He only wears a set of old Xiangyun yarn short jacket and pants, barefoot in shoes, and holds a banana fan in his hand. This appearance already looks like a butcher who is resting. The flirtation with Aunt Sun in the first act does not make us feel bad. This is his stage ethics and the performance of not playing low-level humor. The fight in the last act is not delayed by his obesity, so we feel very real. This fat actor cannot be compared with those actors in the past who only knew how to play low-level tricks but did not know acting skills, and only relied on their appearance to play with the audience.</p>
<p>The cast of this play is relatively uniform. Although it cannot be said how uniform the performance is, it is quite acceptable. The actors also have their own characteristics, but it is not personal development.</p>
<p>The morality of actors lies in making the performance complete, rather than making themselves stand out beyond other actors.</p>

<h3>Zhang Yiyun Will Return North Soon</h3>
<p>— Deng Gong</p>
<p>No Performance in Shanghai</p>
<p>Famous Kunqu opera actress Zhang Yiyun came to Shanghai this time to visit her maternal grandmother and participated in the charity performance for the Northeast at the Tianchan Stage, which was well received. The actress told reporters backstage at Tianchan that she does not intend to perform in Shanghai and will return north soon. Zhang Yiyun is the younger sister of Du Yun, one of the four great Kunqu opera actresses. She was very popular in performances in Pingjin. This time, she came to Shanghai but did not perform, which will surely disappoint many opera fans.</p>

<h3>Film Criticism: "Song of the Marines"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>It is said that this is a good film that once caused a sensation in the wartime capital, and it is also said that it is adapted from a famous American film and drama. However, after watching it, I cannot see its merits. Now I would like to say a few words about this film from an artistic point of view. This film has very little drama. Only a few places are good: (1) The soldiers who participated in the First World War now see the Second World War again, and also see the barracks they used to live in. One person even hums the old song from that year... At the same time, watching their sons also repeat their tasks one by one. (2) The descendants also have military band opera performances, and the previous generations assist and supervise the stage work of the descendants. When a few old men are jumping on the stage, and their wives and children are watching from the audience, it really gives a good effect.</p>
<p>In addition to these two points, when Katie Smith sings "God Bless America," several family-to-family shots are quite active. However, compared with the section in "Jia Hui Liang Yuan" where "I think I'm in love" is sung, it is far worse.</p>
<p>Using men to impersonate women in military performances is a fact and is filmed in the movie. The first effect is not bad, but if he repeatedly uses it at all costs, then the effect will gradually decrease.</p>
<p>It is always good to see a large-scale military exercise on stage once, but if you see it twice, you will lose interest. This is the same principle as the previous one. Although its background is often changed, the stationary background drawn here can only give people a joy of one or two yarn clocks, and the remaining other parts often give people an ordinary impression.</p>
<p>I don't understand why the director made this play so closely guarded within the scope of the stage. It is simply putting the camera stand under the stage and shooting towards the stage. When there is a scene of actors on the stage, he also stops, and waits for the scenery to be changed before shooting again, so that the audience is watching a movie, but they still feel like they are watching a stage play.</p>
<p>The insertion of President Roosevelt and General Marshall watching the play is also an arrangement to enhance "adapting to the American people's hearts." However, it uses a long shot - a substitute - about this point, I think even Americans are very disappointed. In fact, for this type of film, as long as the publicity is effective, it is not impossible to even invite President Roosevelt to join a shot.</p>
<p>The play is also very flat in terms of arrangement. The front part uses subtitles a lot. Although this can give the audience a "antique" feeling, the supervisor should never forget that making the audience bored is more important than any other problem. Replaying a movie from thirty years ago is definitely not something that can be welcomed by the public.</p>
<p>The whole play lacks climax.</p>
<p>Joan Leslie's role is of no importance. The question of whether to marry or not seems to be somewhat contradictory. I believe that most American men are definitely not so insightful that they would not care about marrying their lovers because of war. So why use Ronald Reagan and Joan Leslie to overthrow this question? If a woman is used as a soldier's lover in a play, there are many usages, why decide on this kind of small writing?</p>
<p>In terms of scenery, it is good on stage, but it seems to be not enough in the movie. There are a few scenes that are meaningless, and it is not a pity to have a few less. The scene of the sailor standing in front of the ship is the most wonderful.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, George's performance on stage after several injuries is good. Other actors, Ronald Reagan, Alan Hale, etc. are all average.</p>
<p>In short, this play can be a sensation in the United States, but not in our country, especially in Shanghai after the war.</p>
<h3>Distant Love</h3>
<p>— Yu Fu</p>
<p>The Second New Film of China Electric Second Factory</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Xu Suya, the Second Factory of the Central Film Studio has completed Wu Yonggang's "Loyal Family," which will soon be seen by audiences in this city. The authorities of the China Electric Second Factory saw that foreign films were flooding the market and a large amount of foreign exchange was flowing out, so they wanted to actively produce films to resist foreign films. Therefore, after completing the work of "Loyal Family," they immediately started the work of the second new film "Distant Love."</p>
<p>"Distant Love" is written and directed by Chen Liting, and the actors include Zhao Dan, Qin Yi, Wu Yin, Zhang Yan, etc.</p>
<p>This is a historical narrative film. The entire play takes sixteen years. From the female protagonist A Ling being a nanny, to A Zhen being educated, becoming a professor's wife, participating in the nursing work of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, and then participating in the battlefield service of August 13th, until she returns and leaves her husband when the Anti-Japanese War is won.</p>
<p>In this film, the playwright tells us: the social environment and the influence of characters will make a person decide the way of life in the future, whether it is great or small!</p>
<p>The story of the film begins with:</p>
<p>In the winter of 1929, Professor Xiao Yuanxu gave a lecture at the Shanghai Women's Progressive Association. Because it took too long, his lover Zhu Manli became impatient and broke up with him unhappily. Professor Xiao Yuanxu therefore wanted to create an ideal wife himself. Therefore, the young nanny in his family became his target.</p>
<p>Professor Xiao passed on his knowledge to A Zhen, so that A Zhen was no longer a nanny, but "a modern Miss Yu." Under the influence of Miss Wu, the person in charge of the Women's Progressive Association, she participated in women's work, which made her know many female workers who lived a hard life. At the same time, her brother was bullied by the Japanese and ran away from the factory to become a soldier. Her father was also too poor to live.</p>
<h3>A Strange Tale from New York</h3>
<p>— Feng Chang</p>
<p>This film is very good, composed of several short segments; in my overall rating, it should be a "B+". It has a strong dramatic flavor, and is more lively and brilliant than "Flesh and Spirit."</p>
<p>The entire film consists of five segments. The first is delicate, the second is light and cheerful, the third is the most profound, making you shed tears amidst laughter. The fourth cannot quite carry on the momentum from the previous segment, and the fifth is the conclusion, which can comfortably relax your tense heart.</p>
<p>The main character of the film is a large formal dress. Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, Ginger Rogers, and others are supporting actors, but they are extraordinarily well-cast, and each can satisfy more than your needs.</p>
<p>Among the "good" aspects, to pick out the best, it is still the two Charleses and Ginger Rogers.</p>
<p>I originally intended to review this film in this newspaper, but due to time constraints, I will first provide a brief introduction here, and then give a more detailed review in another newspaper.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Stage Technology</h3>
<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>Three: The Symbolism of Color</p>
<p>The symbolism of color arises from history, customs, and religion, which over thousands or hundreds of years, have become almost fixed, evoking certain emotions and associations in people. Understanding this reflection and association of historical emotions allows us to use the power of various color symbols in stage sets as we desire. This not only expresses the special mood of a particular play, preparing appropriate emotions for the characters, but also gives the scenery an unexpected and mysterious vitality, supporting a higher artistic value for the drama. The symbolism of each color is listed below:</p>
<p>1. Bright Red: Symbolizes bloodshed, tragedy, danger, destruction, crime, bravery, stubbornness, revenge, anger, passion, greed, great sound, patriotism, piety, purity, nobility, splendor, emphasis, and creativity.</p>
<p>2. Pink: Symbolizes truth, love, beauty, shyness, health, and bewilderment.</p>
<p>3. Scarlet: Symbolizes patriotism, beauty, honor, anger, and blood.</p>
<p>4. Crimson: Symbolizes sincerity, universal love, hatred, struggle, violence, elegance, generosity, and beauty.</p>
<p>5. Dark Red: Symbolizes submission, dignity, monotony, inferiority, poverty, autumn, and monks.</p>
<p>6. Orange and Amber: Symbolizes wild laughter, lightheartedness, vitality, happiness, contentment, richness, autumn, warmth, and fire.</p>
<p>7. Bright Yellow: Symbolizes gold, sunlight, brightness, nobility, gentleness, brilliance, wealth, royalty, harvest, peace, solemnity, indulgence, and jealousy.</p>
<p>8. Brown: Symbolizes submission, rest, concentration, slowness, sorrow, maturity, dullness, fullness, deceit, transience, and clumsiness.</p>
<p>9. Blackish-Yellow: Symbolizes disease, destruction, deceit, cowardice, jealousy, transience, and clumsiness.</p>
<p>10. Yellow-Green: Symbolizes peace, youth, happiness, harvest, sweetness, kisses, vitality, love, and dance.</p>
<p>11. Bright Green: Symbolizes youth, vitality, innocence, faith, young people, immaturity, non-stimulation, hope, peace, plans, victory, eternity, smiles, success, and health.</p>
<p>12. Light Blue: Symbolizes silence, mystery, ideals, poetry, repression, sorrow, submission, distance, aloofness, coldness, faith, holiness, pity, immaturity, loneliness, and comfort.</p>
<p>13. Bright Blue: Symbolizes greatness, calmness, tranquility, mystery, expansiveness, affirmation, truth, stability, solemnity, sorrow, hope, love, loyalty, faithfulness, silence, eternity, calmness, success, winter, and lack of sympathy.</p>
<p>14. Dark Blue: Symbolizes amiability, humility, coldness, sorrow, and profundity.</p>
<p>15. Purple: Symbolizes hope, love, splendor, and sincerity.</p>
<p>16. Bluish-Purple: Symbolizes love, truth, calmness, sorrow, and sadness.</p>
<p>17. Faint Purple: Symbolizes beauty, elegance, old age, and slight sorrow.</p>
<p>18. Reddish-Purple: Symbolizes royalty, warmth, solemnity, composure, stimulation, calmness, submission, richness, joy, and nobility.</p>
<p>19. Black: Symbolizes lowness, devils, evil, magic, death, widows, frustration, monks, despair, faults, sorrow, seriousness, and mystery.</p>
<p>20. White: Symbolizes sacrifice, humility, simplicity, integrity, truth, light, peace, innocence, chastity, beauty, weakness, gods, angels, ghosts, the Holy Mother, female saints, wise men, death, and terror.</p>
<p>21. Gray: Symbolizes storms, cunning, coldness, severity, old age, plainness, faithfulness, secrets, calmness, tranquility, sorrow, worry, stillness, seclusion, gloom, frustration, desolation, poverty, decline, silence, and dullness.</p>
<p>The moods and various special characteristics symbolized by these colors must be determined according to the different occasions when they are selected, in order to determine the different effects they express. In other words, the same hue will have different meanings in different dramatic contexts. For example, if red is used as the color of a living room wall, we feel a passionate mood. In another play, when red light is projected onto the war scenery and characters, we feel hatred and bloodshed. Therefore, we know that light, color, and dyeing alone do not have fixed symbolic meanings. The expression of its symbolic meaning must be combined with a certain plot, characters, and scenery. Conversely, only in this way can the audience accurately grasp its symbolic power. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Three Notes on Reading Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Yi De arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing via the Northwest. After about a week, today, taking advantage of the opportunity to teach at the Art Academy, I had a long talk with him and asked him to display his works. I was able to view more than fifty sketches he had made over the past four years, traveling through Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and other provinces, and to see the true face of his meticulously crafted masterpieces, following the path of artistic development.</p>
<p>Last October, he said in a letter to me:</p>
<p>"...Artistic inclinations are gradually abandoning the old and pursuing progress. In the past two years, I have made watercolors and sketches in the Southeast, mostly with real life as the subject matter. I once lived for a week on Xihua Mountain in Dayu, Jiangxi, to depict the lives of miners. This summer, I lived with people in a factory for a month, depicting their work. Recently, I have been using these sketches as themes, shutting myself in my room every day to create large-scale oil paintings..."</p>
<p>From these words, I was filled with anticipation for his works full of reality. Unfortunately, this time, due to the arduous journey, he only brought these watercolor and sketch pieces, and the large oil paintings will have to wait until the National Art Academy moves east.</p>
<p>Although they are only some watercolor and sketch pieces, we can know for sure how Yi De wants to express reality. The small landscape paintings make us feel not only tranquility and leisure, but also an epitome of the hard lives of the masses, a duet of stillness and movement. Like "Soldier Picking Up Stones," "Banks of the Jialing River," and "Xihua Mountain," we deeply feel the highly expressive effect of art in which content and form are unified, under the solidity and reality of the modeling sense, and the emphasis and unity of the picture.</p>
<p>Also the sketches, we only feel the strength and density of the lines, and from the composition of these lines, we obtain a perfect and real sense of modeling.</p>
<p>Artists should experience life in the ranks of the masses, otherwise their works will not be true and touching.</p>
<p>I already published an article "Liu Shi's Fish Exhibition" the day before yesterday. Today, after attending the reception tea party hosted by Hai Weng for his book exhibition and rereading his works, I would like to write a few more thoughts below.</p>
<p>Shi Zi is a Western painter, sculptor, and arts and crafts artist. He is a successful writer who has passed through various departments of modeling art with extraordinary talent. It is not surprising that he began studying ink and wash paintings with light colors during the Anti-Japanese War. This is just another aspect of artistic expression.</p>
<p>Shi Zi's works are mainly fish, and these fish are not identical in form. Moreover, he can express the floating and transparent character of water on thin rice paper, which is considered precious by ordinary Chinese painters.</p>
<p>The creation of Chinese art must find a way out on the path of unifying content and form, but the exploration of perfect descriptive techniques is absolutely not negligible. Only content without form will result in propagandistic, record-like, and explanatory works, and the value of art will be completely absent.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that in terms of technique, general Chinese paintings are often拘泥于占人, rigidly adhering to the established methods of past masters, either Song or Yuan. When discussing landscapes, it is Jing Guan Dong Ju, when talking about flowers and birds, it is Qing Teng Bai Yang. These established methods often restrict a writer. Li Cheng said: "Learning from past masters is not as good as learning from nature." This is a major revelation to break through this inherited tradition. Shi Zi's works have already been able to express the acceptance of this major revelation.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, many artists shifted the content of their creations to the real lives of the people in the rear, using simple equipment to make faithful depictions. Wu Zuoren, whose painting exhibition will be held from the 16th, is taking such a path.</p>
<p>Zuoren spent almost more than two years walking through Qinghai, Tibet, Xikang, Gansu and other provinces. In that vast and remote place, there are primitive production tools and means of production, primitive dances, primitive decorations, as well as the realistic mood of nomadic life, high mountains, large deserts, camels, ice and snow, cowhide rafts, tents... The realities that cannot be seen in the water towns of Jiangnan are all depicted in Zuoren's works.</p>
<p>Zuoren mostly uses the so-called watercolor painting techniques to depict, although it is only a light and thin layer of color, it produces extremely harmonious contrasts, especially in the costumes of the Kang and Tibetan peoples, with eastern simple, original decorative color tones. Those who have not been to the Northwest may not be able to imagine it.</p>
<p>From his few sketches, we can again feel the depth of his realistic skill. In the light and agile lines, the reality of reality is grasped without omission. If not, then the colored works would never be so real.</p>
<p>The content of artworks should be expanded in scope, and from Zuoren's many paintings, every writer living in a small room will gain an inspiration.</p>
<h3>The Singing Girl by the An'an River (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Luo</p>
<p>On a sultry summer evening, after a thunderstorm, a beautiful rainbow woven of red, blue, green, and purple appeared in the sky above the Xin'an River, arching across the northeast edge of the sky.</p>
<p>White clouds danced in the mountains, lovingly swallowing and spitting out the sun; the clouds moved away, and the sunlight that suddenly revealed itself was so fierce, unnatural, and unable to be looked at directly.</p>
<p>The trees on both banks were like they had been drenched with basin water, the dense and fresh leaves dripping with beads of water, dripping into the tangled grass.</p>
<p>The small fish in the river became even more lively, cluster after cluster, wandering on the water, under the moss, and in the crevices of the rocks.</p>
<p>At the east end, the small apprentices in Yao's teahouse were arguing, and behind the mountain, the bugle call of the troops rang out...</p>
<p>After dinner, the big, round, bright moon had already sat on the treetop. W, H, Mr. and I sat leisurely on the lawn, listening to Liu's boasting about his romantic anecdotes. Suddenly, that clear and melancholy singing voice of a young girl, supported by the fragmented huqin, resounded again on the banks of the Xin'an River.</p>
<p>"Let's take a stroll—" the northerner Liu suggested. So everyone stood up, patted the mud off their pants, and walked towards the riverbank.</p>
<p>Since that day, the old ferryman had been rowing that fair young singing girl with long eyelashes, big eyes, and dark skin, and a middle-aged woman who was also a琴手 (qin player) across the river to us. Since that day, whenever the moon rose, there would be singing on the banks of the Xin'an River—sometimes it lingered suddenly to the west, and sometimes it was parked on the pebble beach on the riverbank.</p>
<p>Ten or so small stools were arranged in a circle on the pebble beach, with the audience sitting around; they sipped tea to quench their thirst, waved their palm-leaf fans to cool off, and squinted their eyes and listened intently. The young girl, with two braids, wearing a bamboo cloth cheongsam, was surrounded in the middle, her face raised to the sky, singing laboriously, the woman's clumsy fingers rising and falling on the strings.</p>
<p>The moonlight caressed the audience, and also caressed the singing girl. In the distance, it seemed that fog was rising in the forest. On the other side of the river, the old ferryman untied the rope and turned the boat's head to row over here.</p>
<p>More than twenty pairs of eyes stared greedily at the singing girl, worry and fear engraved on her face, and her singing voice became hesitant and trembling...</p>
<p>The surroundings were a kind of oppression to her!</p>
<p>The singing voice was buried in the applause, and then escaped from the applause again. Everyone listened with great interest, one song after another.</p>
<p>"Hey! Tell them not to leave after they finish listening, wait for everyone to leave and then we..." Platoon Leader Liu had a sudden idea, twisted my ear and said. After a while, I conveyed this opinion to everyone.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the first month of the new year,</p>
<p>I take my little sister to see the lanterns,</p>
<p>Seeing the lanterns is just an excuse, sister;</p>
<p>Flirting is the real intention...</p>
<p>Platoon Leader Liu was panting beside him...</p>
<p>The moon was in the middle of the sky, and sleepiness quietly came, leaning against the chair, holding the pot, waving the fan weakly, dragging their tired bodies, the audience staggered back, even yawning.</p>
<p>The girl sat down, counted the money again, handed it to the woman, then propped her cheek with one hand, and sighed facing the moon—what a pale complexion!</p>
<p>The woman actually started nodding off...</p>
<p>Only the six of us were left on the banks of the Xin'an River?</p>
<p>"...You on my behalf..." the northerner stammered to everyone, no one was willing to accept this mission, although everyone understood his request.</p>
<p>In the end, he went up by himself.</p>
<p>"Old lady..." the northerner turned back with embarrassment, looking at us shyly. We immediately retreated to the trees in the distance, watching the progress of this "?" play.</p>
<p>The northerner gesticulated and chattered with the woman for a long time. In addition to being surprised, the woman seemed hesitant and embarrassed. Seeing her go over and ask the singing girl in her ear, the singing girl kept shaking her head. The woman spoke again to her ear...</p>
<p>"Advance!" W君 (Mr. W) whispered the order, so the four of us crawled lightly forward like a night raid, stopping under a big tree behind them, holding our breaths.</p>
<p>"Two thousand yuan, right?"</p>
<p>"Sir, things are too expensive, you still care about two thousand yuan..."</p>
<p>"Two thousand yuan is not a small amount!"</p>
<p>"You really can't buy anything..."</p>
<p>"Then forget it!"</p>
<p>"Sir, do a good deed...add a thousand yuan!"</p>
<p>"Two thousand, take it or leave it!"</p>
<p>"Sir..." The woman glanced at the singing girl. "Sir, can't you add any more?..."</p>
<p>"Hmm!"</p>
<p>"Okay—then!..." The woman lowered her face.</p>
<p>The platoon leader scooped a handful from his waist and handed it to the woman. By the moonlight, the woman carefully counted the bills one by one with trembling hands. The newly printed banknotes rustled...</p>
<p>The platoon leader walked over and pulled up the girl sitting on the ground. The woman stopped all her actions and stared blankly.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the field over there..." The platoon leader said draggingly, pulling at her and wanting to leave.</p>
<p>"Mom!" She suddenly turned around as if she was going to pounce on her mother, her hands outstretched toward her mother for help, making a tragic, desperate cry like a criminal making a last struggle before execution.</p>
<p>"...My mother's reply flowed out with tears, and my nose tingled...;</p>
<p>"Mom!"</p>
<p>"Poor...child..." "Mom, you also..."</p>
<p>"Good son, I can't…"</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm scared!"</p>
<p>"It's...okay, sir, is very good..."</p>
<p>The platoon leader carried her forward, the girl was trapped in the platoon leader's strong arms, and followed staggeringly朝西邊曠野里奔去, towards the wilderness in the west, and gradually the two disappeared into the mist...</p>
<h3>A Smile of Empathy</h3>
<p>— Song Mengqin</p>
<p>Mr. T and Miss S each occupied a corner of the sofa, flipping through the pages of books. They picked up factory management, put down accounting, picked out commercial psychology, and then put down factory management. Every two or three pages they read, or perhaps two or three articles they flipped through, T would invariably unconsciously peel open a piece of candy, or a lychee, and send it to S's hand, and then he himself would hastily pick up a Camel, after all, his grades still had some authority, and their love talk was temporarily put on hold.</p>
<p>A burst of hurried, staggered footsteps came from the corridor, and they knew that it must be Mr. C and his fiancée Miss G who were coming. So T and S perked up.</p>
<p>"You guys are suffering!" C said with a smile, taking off his light green sunglasses.</p>
<p>"Are you all prepared?" T was prompted by a kind of hope in his heart to ask this question. He would only be satisfied if the other party gave a contrary answer.</p>
<p>"Annoying, I can't go see 'Little Women'!" G's words lightly escaped from her peachy, pouting lips.</p>
<p>"Are you talking about preparing books? Sorry, can books give me any security? We made a mistake by studying business administration. Look, the strange phenomena in the city are just that coffins don't need to be shipped from America. When we actually manage industry and commerce, how many factories and companies will still exist?" C was sighing and complaining, not knowing whether it was for the public or for himself or for tomorrow's exam, forcing himself to be brave.</p>
<p>"It's over, it's over. China is simply over. Hopeless..." T sighed deeply.</p>
<p>"Even the only trace of industrial breath is being suffocated. It's over. What are we talking about revival? Industrial bankruptcy directly affects the economy. Economic bankruptcy is more dangerous than political turmoil. How can we get through this!" C said while swallowing the iced orange juice that the servant of S's mansion had sent, his worries deepened, and some angry enthusiasm was expressed in his eyes. Then he said to S:</p>
<p>"Miss, make two fewer linen dresses, the motherland's crisis is at hand."</p>
<p>"Damn it! You're finding fault with me. Only ghosts use glass braces!" S just said this but stuck out her tongue and looked back at T, and luckily T was wearing Chinese clothes today, so she continued, but her eyes turned to Miss C:</p>
<p>"Miss, buy two fewer pairs of glass leather shoes, the motherland's crisis is at hand." Everyone burst into laughter, and in this continuous laughter, Miss G's sharp and tender tone floated out:</p>
<p>"Okay! Tomorrow we will start gathering comrades to revive China's industry and commerce. We must start working!" T's emotions were very enthusiastic, and he threw the half-smoked cigarette and the book of commercial psychology on the carpet. And he added an old tune that was both true and false:</p>
<p>"We must proceed, with a broad vision and start with small steps!"</p>
<p>"That's right, a broad vision and start with small steps!"</p>
<p>"Of course, a broad vision and start with small steps!"</p>
<p>The four of them shouted loudly, as if industrial and commercial interests had already started to be revived by them.</p>
<p>However, T was a little tired of this issue, and the issue of the Dragon Boat Festival gift for S was secretly stirring in his mind. But this should be forgiven for him. S's gifts always required him to plan with all his heart, yet he could hardly satisfy her.</p>
<p>Suddenly C started singing loudly. And his body was propelled off the sofa by that singing voice. He sang:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth..."</p>
<p>The three of them couldn't help but join in, and the air became more lively.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth, sells cloth to buy rice, there's food for the stomach.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth,</p>
<p>The little brother's pants are torn, there's no cloth to mend them.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth, who buys cloth, the wealthy man in the next village.</p>
<p>Homespun cloth is sparse, foreign cloth is fine,</p>
<p>Foreign cloth is cheap, the wealthy man is happy.</p>
<p>No one wants homespun cloth, the brother and sister-in-law starve!"</p>
<p>"Ah! The decline of the rural economy, the bankruptcy of family handicraft industry, the capitalists are making trouble with money, the forces of foreign goods are rampant... This song writes about modern China..." C may have been too excited, and therefore could not think of a suitable word to describe China, so he could only sigh for a while to end this speech.</p>
<p>They seemed to have a common feeling that "it's getting late," so the four of them had the intention of going out. Miss S had already arranged to go to Avenue Joffre with T at four o'clock, so she told the servant: "Tell Madam when she returns that Mr. T and I have gone out."</p>
<p>They walked out of the gate at the same time, but two went east and two went west, and they said goodbye to each other.</p>
<p>When T and S passed through Rue Mairesse and entered the Grigorieff Company, they saw C and G selecting colors in the linen display department. When eight eyes met unintentionally, each gave the other a smile of empathy.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings</h3>
<p>— Shu Sun Ruying</p>
<p>In today's society, competence is almost synonymous with being slick and dishonest, while honesty has practically become a disadvantage. If you want to survive, you have to disregard the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, and morality that you've received, even though you still need to pay lip service to those teachings, using them to lecture your children or deceive those with whom you have a vested interest.</p>
<p>In the past, I was young and naive—today, I'm still young, but I'm slowly moving away from naivete. My naive heart once made me believe in the teachings of books, the teachings that elders earnestly imparted; but today, as naivete fades away, I feel bewildered. I don't know how to live—how to earn money to support myself, how to develop myself as a person, this personality, this mind full of thoughts.</p>
<p>Based solely on my meager income as a public school employee, I cannot support myself and my small family. To seek other opportunities for development? I can't, because I'm not competent. I'm already busy enough for eight hours a day in the office, where would I have any remaining energy? Perhaps this incompetence of mine is just that I'm not slick and dishonest? Not being slick and dishonest means being too honest, and being too honest is a disadvantage. With this enormous disadvantage, I've forfeited my right to exist in this stubborn society.</p>
<p>Unable to live on, yet I still live on. Of course, I'm not eating my fill, but I'm not starving to death either. I live like this. Living, besides being busy with life, is also about thinking. My mind still has the capacity to think, which must be considered a blessing. I hope that everything will get better, that the darkness will eventually pass. I think about why we live at all? Why do we allow life to continue? If today's situation never changes, or if it changes but becomes even worse, then we humans should all go on strike. Let my hands go on strike, my mouth go on strike, my circulatory system, my respiratory system go on strike, let our minds go on strike, thinking go on strike. Let life stop, let existence stop. However, that day will not come, life must continue, because we still have hope.</p>
<p>Our hope has existed in the minds of our ancestors. This hope exists in the heart of every person. But you alone cannot reach this ideal state; to reach this ideal state, all of humanity must move in unison. But humanity's pace cannot be unified, at least that is certainly the case today. Thus, some are called competent, while others are called slick and dishonest, some are called honest, while others are called useless. In short, this is a fantastical world, inexplicable and yet needing no explanation.</p>
<p>I resent today, and yet I also praise today. Because tomorrow can only be reached by passing through today. However, on the road, never lose the hope that makes our heads ache.</p>
<p>June 9th, in Hongkou</p>
<h3>Dark Night</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhifu</p>
<p>I opened my eyes, and a pitch-black world suddenly appeared before me, and it seemed like I was the only person in this world, and all the darkness's advancements were directed towards me: moreover, besides the faint breathing sound next to me, this world seemed unimaginably deathly silent... Usually, no matter what time it is, as long as you open your ears and wake up, the docks will always emit some miscellaneous human voices or the sound of a wave crashing. I don't know how long the entire long night has passed, but the clock on the wall is striking three, telling me that it is almost dawn.</p>
<p>I often think this way, I need light, I cannot live in a dark environment for even a moment. But now, reality forces me to have this completely different thought, facing this dark world, I have strange feelings, my thoughts are filled with conflicting feelings of seeking light and hating darkness, and all kinds of strange ideas also seem to know my weakness, invading my mind, making my restless heart even more agitated.</p>
<p>Gradually, my thoughts entered a state of confusion, I experienced some of life's pains, and I also heard some cries of life: "Comrades, do not groan,</p>
<p>We must grit our teeth!</p>
<p>Thick and long iron chains,</p>
<p>Bind us into one heart.</p>
<p>We advance through the darkness,</p>
<p>We advance towards dawn!"</p>
<p>I saw, millions of women, children, the old, and the weak ended their wandering lives and returned to their desolate homes, but before they could even find their footing, they fled from their own homes again, resuming their wandering lives, running around in the streets. I also saw countless corpses of the starved lying in deserted streets and alleys, some even still moving their mouths, sustaining their last bit of life, waiting for death... My entire heart was occupied by tragic scenes, I couldn't suppress my burning feelings, and tears crawled itchingly down my face, falling onto the pillow.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I got up and lit the lamp, drove away the darkness in the room, and opened a not-too-old newspaper, hoping to reduce my uneasy emotions with it, but just as I lowered my head, a similar scene unfolded before my eyes again:</p>
<p>"To ××, we visited the disaster in ×× village, ×× village has 24,000 people, it is said that 20,000 people have no food to eat. The villagers ran over from the rubble, kneeling by the road begging us, "Lord Heaven! Please save us!" Tears rolled down along the eye sockets. They live in thatched sheds built on scorched wasteland, eating tree bark and grass roots – ground ivy, kudzu root, *Elaeocarpus* bark, *Potentilla freyniana*, goosewort, fern root, and also bran and wheat husks..." Below were some blurred and sad words "Selling their own children... After selling the son, the wife jumped into the water..."</p>
<p>I raised my head, unable to bear to read any further, at the same time, my heart also felt a stinging pain, this is the truth, what else can I say! I can only close my eyes and remain silent!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the clock on the wall struck two more times than before, and faint rays of light gradually penetrated through the cracks in the window. So, I knew that the dark night was nearing its end, followed by the fresh dawn! I opened the window sash, welcoming it with a confused mood.</p>
<p>Light is such a noble possession to me! Day has broken, who would still happily stay in this dark and gloomy long night?</p>

<p>The proprietress enthusiastically rushed to make two sets of printed cloth shirts and pants to give to the tailor, on the day of "crossing the threshold" (in the north, when a daughter-in-law goes to her in-laws' house, it is called "crossing the threshold"). Xiao Hong wore this new outfit. No ceremony was held, the proprietress combined the Kitchen God Festival and the marrying of the child bride, and invited three or four tables of guests. At the same time, she also took the opportunity to send off the employees of the Huichun Hall who had been fired. The proprietress's calculation was shrewd, killing three birds with one stone!</p>
<p>Having started to work as a "child bride," Xiao Hong dressed up this day, applied some powder to her face, and combed the thin, long braid on her head so smoothly, tied with a red hair tie. The tailor sent her to the Liao family, where she kowtowed to Boss Liao and the proprietress, and also kowtowed to the butcher matchmaker and the elders and relatives. Then, the proprietress called Liao Dong over to meet her. But Liao Dong didn't even raise his head, let alone look at Xiao Hong with his eyes.</p>
<p>Bao Ling watched all this like a play, feeling curious and also very comical. He wanted to laugh, but he also wanted to cry! He pitied little Liao Dong for being innocently manipulated by the proprietress like a monkey show! "Liao Dong is really a sheep!" Bao Ling said in his heart. He thought: if this matter happened to him, he would definitely not be so obedient and let them manipulate him, he would argue with them; resist; and even run away! He would deal with Mrs. Mo that way. But Liao Dong dared not! He is not like Bao Ling, Mrs. Mo is Bao Ling's birth mother! A birth mother can dote on her children, but a stepmother will not. So Liao Dong is sad! Fortunately, Liao Dong was a bit more open-minded than before, he had not been overly troubled by this matter, because he also regarded this matter as a play to watch and act in!</p>
<p>Boss Liao and the proprietress were both very happy, Boss Liao was happy that the family had an extra helper. After three to five years, if they got married, he would be able to hold his grandson. As the saying goes, "When the population is prosperous, wealth can be prosperous"! Thinking of this, he couldn't wait to marry them off earlier. The proprietress didn't think so, she only knew that the completion of this matter was to satisfy her secret desire for revenge against Liao Dong, and later Liao Dong's birth mother! To secretly rejoice, to rejoice for being able to vent her jealousy and cruel nature!</p>
<p>Speaking of Xiao Hong herself, her heart was more complicated than Liao Dong's, perhaps girls mature earlier than boys, moreover, she was ultimately two years older than Liao Dong. Before she came to the Liao family, she was able to realize the relationship of this kind of marriage, she would secretly rejoice for this relationship! Now, after she had met Liao Dong—this future man who would become her husband, she felt joy and also shyness! She was happy that she would have someone to rely on from now on, she quietly paid attention to everything in this family, she saw that everything was better than her own family, she believed that she would no longer starve. She dreamed that one day she would also help her parents! No longer suffer for burdening her parents! She was shy that she had become someone else's child bride now, had parents-in-law; had a little husband; thinking of this, how embarrassing! She felt her cheeks heat up in waves!</p>
