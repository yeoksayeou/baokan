<h3>國軍抵哈市近郊　共軍正向齊齊哈爾退走</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三十一日電〕軍息：向挺進哈爾濱之國軍快速部隊七千，今日拂曉已抵達距哈市僅十一華里處之東南郊，並佔領高地兩處，共軍略事抵抗後，即後退。據東北消息，國軍現正待命和平進入哈市，共軍已有撤退模樣，目前共軍所爭者，不外下述二事，（一）面子問題，共軍仍擬爭取主動之撤退，以固士氣，藉掩敗徵。（二）實際問題，共軍似希望從馬帥處或其他方面獲得保障，有條件退出哈市，以便確保松花江以北之地盤。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十一日電〕據近由東北來此之某外籍軍事家談：東北之戰，自本溪湖以迄四平街，公主嶺之役，共軍主力已損失六萬人，就中陣亡及負傷者，約佔四分之一，不足二萬人。大多數共軍官兵，均於敗退時携械或棄械逃走，所謂民主聯軍，實已潰不成軍，被俘之共軍官兵曾謂：當林彪，周保中光後在四平街，長春作最後一次訓話，亦公開承認共軍在過去十餘年大小數千次戰鬥中，雖亦間有逃兵，但臨陣脫逃未敗先潰，戰敗後一閧而散之種種不幸現象，將以此爲首次。東北共軍之士氣，殆已一蹶不振，共軍不惜萬里狼奔，逞強裹脅良民，草草成軍，兵無鬥志，怨聲載道，宜有此失，所可憫者，此數萬敗逃之共軍，類多籍隷湖北，皖北，豫南，蘇北，魯南，冀南之無辜民衆，被脅受騙，以至拋妻別子，萬里流浪，情何以堪。故共軍一聞中央派員至東北各地撫輯流亡，予以救濟，多携械來歸，戰局演變至此，優勝劣敗之勢已明，東北統一之期，計日可待矣。</p>
<p>〔法新聞長春三十一日電〕據負責方面消息：國軍新六軍昨渡越松花江上游，到達吉林省城東北數英里之某地。該軍其他部隊則沿長春東北之鐵路推進，昨越過張家灣，到達哈爾濱西南約八英里之松花江岸，中共軍正向齊齊哈爾退　。</p>
<p>〔合衆社長春卅一日電〕東北國軍總司令杜聿明將軍今日明白宣布，國軍將繼續向東九省北部推進。渠謂，政府決心接收東北全境，「如有阻礙此項計劃者，吾人誓必與之作戰。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社長春卅日電〕（遲到）據今日此間所獲司令部方面消息：國軍已佔有一廣大之安全圈，其伸展至東西北三方面之半徑，約爲長春四週之八十哩，使共軍無法對長春再有發動反攻之威脅。五月廿八日起，吉林已穩入國軍之手，向北佔有德惠，約離長六十哩，係一鐵路城鎭，彼處國軍已到達松花江南岸。松花江在長春以北二十哩，幾爲長春與哈爾濱之一半途徑。</p>

<h3>本市美國同學會席上　孫科闡述立法程序　並分別說明公司法土地法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕立法院院長孫科，昨應本市美國同學會之請，參加該會在大東酒樓所舉行之聚餐會，並即席發表演詞。出席餐會者，有呉市長，市府秘書長何德奎，公用局長趙曾鈺，工務局長趙祖康，駐華美軍總司令吉倫少將，美駐滬總領事戴維斯，美法官海爾密克等。餐畢，首由同學會會長史密氏致歡迎詞，並介紹孫院長略歷，旋即由孫院長起立致詞，略稱：今日與舊雨新知，聚首一堂，實感榮幸。本人過去歷任立法院院長垂十四年，故今日擬就中國之立法及立法程序，略抒所見。孫氏稱：立法院各立法委員，迄目前爲止，仍係由政府指派，凡法律案由立法院通過，經國府公布者爲法。孫氏旋解釋法與令之區別，復舉出新公司法及土地法，分別說明，對新公司法草案規定外國公司如欲在華營業，則該公司在其本國亦須有營業一點，曾約略解釋。並稱：頒布之新公司法中，已將此項規定予以取消。新公司法中，已將舊有與公司法有關之法律條例等規定包含在內。述及土地法時則稱：該法對土地所有權及賦稅等，均有規定。近聞上海方面對地產買賣，有按其成交價抽稅百分之四十之說，故地產交易頗呈呆滯，惟該項抽稅規定，與土地法規定，未盡相符，故如提交立法院審議時，將遭否決。孫氏亟望各地方機關於制定該項類似辦法時，應先熟讀土地法，免致人民遭受損失。孫氏繼談立法程序謂：國府，國防最高委會，各院及立法院本身，均可提案，交立法院審議，立法院現有法制，外交，財政，經濟，軍事等委員會五個，各委員討論一提案時，常請該提案之關係者出席討論，立法院有權通過或否決之。孫氏旋稱：將來國民大會召開，制定憲法後，立法院之立法委員，將由各省市按人口多少比例選出。委員人數大致有五六百人。將來之立法院，將較現時更形重要，行政院之大部國策，均須對立法院負責。如遭立法院否決，則不啻表示立法院對行政院投以不信任之票，則行政院勢須改組。故在新憲法下之立法院，頗相當於英國之衆議院。</p>
<h3>對東北問題樂觀　公務員待遇盼速予調整</h3>
<p>孫氏繼即談黨治制度。略謂：過去國民黨以領導推翻滿清，完成北伐，抗拒國外侵略等事績，在此訓政期間以黨治國之秋，國民黨遂取領導地位，然凡百設施，均待舉辦，國民黨一時當不能全面顧到，惟均已戮力撐其最要者完成之。例如過去十五年間，最要緊之事，厥爲抗拒日本之侵略，今幸樂觀厥成，此後政府，決心逐步還政於民，故對目前國內紛爭，渠亟望能以政治途徑解決。非必要而訴諸武力，實非善策。茲以東北情形而言，蘇軍於撤離東北時，曾於期前照會國府，故唯國府有全權收復東北，設對地方軍隊佔領東北，自設政府諸事，予以承認，則不啻承認國內政府行政業已分化，對外業已形成兩個政府，矧中國與蘇聯，早有中蘇友好條約之訂立，根据該約，中國對中東鐵路，允許蘇聯佔有其利益之半，且規定共同利用旅順港，對大連市，亦予蘇聯以特權。諸如此類之規定，必待國府收復東北後，方能履行，如蘇聯對地方軍隊佔領東北，另設政府，而予承認，則不啻已破壞原有之中蘇友好協定。總之，國府爲唯一代表中國之政府，自必有絕對權力，接收東北。孫氏認爲東北問題必須解決，惟應覓取和平途徑，渠主張共軍部隊應即設法對政府讓步，一切可提交政治協商會議商談，渠最後表示：對東北問題之前途，甚爲樂觀並稱：短期內可望解決，惟望大衆努力，以促其成。</p>
<p>記者於會後叩詢孫氏，公務員待遇之調整，何時以決定，孫氏答稱：「尚在審議中」，何時決定，渠亦未能見告。僅稱：「希望越快越好」。又稱：渠一二日後即將返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕孫院長對中國工商業之前途，極有關懷，並表憂慮，因國內生產品成本高漲，致外銷呆滯，且有陷於停頓者。孫氏認爲國家財政如無困難，則應獎勵出口商，補貼其成本差額，俾利國產外銷，然目前恐難於辦到，其次爲減低生產成本，並　定金融財政，物價漲，人民均蒙其害，故今後經濟財政，應接受各方意見，公開討論，此乃人爲的問題，相信一定可以人爲的力量來解決。</p>
<h3>蘇州城防部　今日正式成立</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州卅一日電〕第一綏　區司令官湯恩伯將軍，鑒於蘇州治安始終滯留於不寗靖階段，影響社會秩序至深且鉅，特電令駐軍一四五師，組織蘇州城防指揮部，派該師副師許元白少將爲指揮官，另聘縣長逯劍華，砲七　　長林日藩，師政　部副主任劉　爲副指揮官，該部組織分參謀，副官，督察，軍法四室，定六月一日正式成立，並舉行各長官就職典禮。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>工潮與法紀</h3>
<p>上海近月來工潮澎湃，此起彼落，影響工業生產，影響社會秩序，情勢逐漸嚴重。昨天且有千餘失業工人大鬧社會局，傷人毀物，毆警奪槍，竟爲工潮別開生面。幸而當局應付有方，未釀事故，但據工人揚言，準備棺材担架，可見必有少數人蓄意鬧事，弄出慘案，這種工潮已非純粹經濟性的了。</p>
<p>社會局今日下午將在市商會召集工廠負責人會議，谷部長呉市長均將蒞臨指導。日前已一度召集過各業工會負責人，呉市長及谷部長曾先後致訓，宣布政府對於處理工潮之重要政策。谷部長指出四項原則；（一）工人合法利益應予保障；（二）勞動紀律必須整飭；（三）勞資糾紛應依法定程序處理；（四）調整工資依照市府頒布之生活費指數加以調整，其工資基數不得變動。各業工資如因生產或營業不佳，廠方確難担負，不能照生活費指數發給工資時，由勞資雙方協商，或由評斷委員會商定辦法，減成發給。呉市長亦宣布處理工潮辦法五點：（一）不准罷工怠工；（二）嚴辦鼓動工潮者；（三）倘有罷工怠工情事，在罷工怠工期間不發工資，並不得以任何名義提出要求；（四）嚴辦鼓動工潮而抽收佣金者；（五）勞工應絕對遵守紀律。我們實在希望此項辦法的公布，爲上海工潮　機之嚆矢，却不料昨天竟由後方來滬的失業工人演出「全武行」，這似乎給當局一個難堪。</p>
<p>從來論工潮者，往往着重於經濟的觀點，以爲生活費用的　續增高，使工資度日者生活爲難。這誠然是平心之論。但現在政府顧慮到工人的生計，採用了依照生活費指數而調整工資，則此項政策是否完全合理，姑不置論，而按照生活費指數所發的工資，總應能維持現在情況下的生活。然則工人如非失業，宜無工潮。昨天又有人說，淪陷時期，上海米價到過每市石僞幣八十萬元，工人平均工資約爲每月十萬元，不及買米一斗半之用，現在米價即作爲六萬元，而工資平均約爲十一二萬元，足敷買米兩石，然而何以工潮反比淪陷時期爲多，且復日甚一日？是則關於工潮的起伏，似不能完全用經濟的因素來加以解釋。</p>
<p>況即就經濟觀點而論，工資依據生活費指數而訂定，自然是出於政府愛護工人的至意，但其間有幾點也值得我們注意：（一）在目今生活費指數漲到戰前四千多倍的情形下，工人固可依生活費指數而得到工資，但爲國家夙夜辛勤，戰時輾轉後方，八九年來含辛茹苦的一般公敎人員，其所得到現在還只有五萬元加底薪一百六十倍，與工人的工資增到三四千倍的情形相較，是中國的工人在今天已經並非生活最苦的人。（二）工資的提高，無疑地要影響到生產費用的騰漲，目前我國生產界的製成品已很難與價廉物美的輸入品相競爭，這種情勢如讓它繼續存在下去，中國工業乃至整個民族經濟遲早必將破產。（三）工資依生活費指數，工人的生活可以照戰前的標準，而且下的工作效率，不要說進步，試問究竟能否起得上戰前的標準？如果工作效率趕不上戰前標準，而工資却與戰前的酬報無異，或且因底薪提高而有過之，此在雇主方面，是否能長久負擔得起？這種「殺雞求蛋」式的工潮，不獨有害於中國工業的前途，甚至無異勞工界之自殺！</p>
<p>推究這種盲目工潮的瘋狂行動之所由起，其初固出發於經濟，而目前則已顯然其有政治的意味。若干陰謀家，正在利用時機，蓄意造成並擴大社會的不安以達到其政治目的。工人不察其間作用，或盲目附和，或自屈於若干煽動者的威力，以致一任少數人的指揮操縱，而自身或莫名其妙。近來的工潮的澎湃，由於被煽動脅迫之力居多。日前呉市長招待新聞記者席上，已有人指出最近人力車夫罷工，就有蘇北派來的煽動家執刀專事戳破人力車輪胎，強阻車夫拉車的事實。昨天字林西報社論，也對上海工人加以警告，說穿上海過去工潮多由別具作用的煽動家所掀起，若　目的不在維護工人利益而在打碎工人飯碗，使得大家沒有飯吃。所以真正愛護工人的，誠懇希望上海的工人們千萬要懸崖勒馬，切不可盲目附和這些煽動者的指使；更希望政府當局，以後不可隨便發言，否則政策既經宣布，就得認真執行，嚴辦擾亂社會秩序的暴徒。</p>
<p>於此，我們又重有所感。即使退百步千步，以罷工怠工爲合法，但因罷工怠工而有搗毀商店廠屋設備或打人以致死傷情事，究爲法律所不容。近來工潮中，時有搗毀店屋及毆人事件發生，昨天甚至工人團鬧社會局，太不成話了！誠然，工人失業，非常痛苦，我們深感同情，政府和社會尤應努力給予工作機會，並繼續救濟，但無論如何，總不應準備棺材鬧命案。我們決不能讓這種風氣持續下去！假使這種風氣不加制止，則工商生產事業將無人問津，國家法紀必將蕩然無遺。此種暴行，多係有組織的，且具相當規模，逐步演進，逐次擴大，且非一二人偶發事件。涓涓不塞，將成江河，我們希望有關當局爲了維護人民的安居樂業，務必制止暴行的發生。因爲暴行決不是普通工潮所應該有的。</p>
<p>總之，上海的工潮發展到現階段，已經成了經濟的因素少而政治意味濃的局面。工人經濟的痛苦，我們固當同情而爲之解除；但工人政治的盲動，我們應該毫不客氣的爲之指出而糾正。純正的工友，須知這樣盲動暴行下去，與其說是在爭取工人自身的利益，毋寗說是在增加社會不安，破壞公共秩序，危害民族生存。工人本來是建國的礎石，萬不可反被野心家利用爲誤國的工具！</p>

<h3>聯合社駐蘇記者之　美蘇關係談片　蘇方認英美集團確實存在　猜疑日甚難謀諒解</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約卅日電〕聯合社駐莫斯科記者吉爾瑪，留居蘇俄五年之久，迄至最近始返國休假。吉氏妻俄女，其本人且通俄文，以此兩種直接關係，故其觀察蘇聯時事，親切有味，非其他外國人隔靴抓癢者可比。茲將其歸國後所述美蘇關係錄之如次：</p>
<p>國務卿貝爾納斯雖謂並未組織英美集國以反對蘇聯，但蘇聯方面一般意見，均以爲此種集團確實存在，過去如此，現在亦然，單憑言語，無論如何懇切，絕不能消除此種信念。英美駐莫斯科使節，對於蘇聯此種信念，類皆知之甚切，且常覺應付爲難，因之雙方均竭力予以避免。即在最近，美新任駐蘇大使史密斯到任，英僑民中高級人員數名擬往機塲循例歡迎，但負責人士則稱，「不去爲　，吾人不可使蘇聯發生印象，以爲吾人迎接棒球新打手赴球塲。」英人初意甚善，今聞此言，乃居家不出。英美人語言相同，亦爲構成誤解之不幸因素。俄人從來不知英美人相對作何語，猶之球戲中之看客，不知裁判與球員相對作何語也。某日，記者在莫斯科於外交宴會中見三五英美人聚在一隅互相背誦詩章，而十呎以外站立俄人數名，確信若輩正被人嘲笑。另一次；余聞俄人討論某種新出香烟，英美人則竚立交相詢問曰：「彼等何所爲耶？」</p>
<p>莫斯科三外長會議時，英美顧問團小心翼翼，以免蘇聯懷疑其有何合夥行動。吾等記者有以此事吿諸蘇聯友人者，彼等輙答曰：「當然，你們良心不安，自感困優。」組織集團之猜疑其進一展有如是者。</p>
<p>十八閱月以前，記者於批評此一問題時，嘗發電曰：「俄人相信英美人間有十種反蘇合夥行動。」電訊檢査員主張將字句改爲「俄人希望英美對蘇並無合夥行動。」十二個月後，記者更加以强調，電文亦被檢査處通過。溯自英國前首相邱吉爾在密蘇里發表演說之後，若有人發電調俄人並不信有合夥行動正在進展，余不信能爲檢査處輕易放過。</p>
<p>美國陸軍參謀總長艾森　威爾及海軍軍令部長尼米茲，最近在衆議院外交委員會致詞，謂西牛球各國陸海軍有合作必要，當然又爆發新懷疑。艾森豪威之言曰：「任何人展望地球，均可察見自歐洲或亞洲至美國之空路挺徑，厥爲取道北極。」俄人聞悉之餘，自必憑添驚覺。若輩問曰：「除吾等外，尙有何人在歐洲或亞洲乎？」多數人且將進而問曰：「此乃自美國至歐洲及亞洲之捷徑，但擁有原子炸彈者究爲誰耶？」此外西半球整個聯防方案，亦必引起蘇聯當局之熱烈討論無疑。</p>
<p>記者出首坦白，無非欲表達蘇聯之見解耳。時至今日，俄人且喃喃自語，甚至公開表示，謂某國不僅反對並排斥蘇聯對歐洲若干國家之政策，其自身現復變本加厲，倡言美國與南美洲各國陸海軍聯防合作。此在蘇聯目光中，若非愚昧，定爲極度之僞善欺人云。</p>

<p>昨日清晨，該後方來滬失業工人於外灘聚集千名，排隊執旗，至社會局請願，當派代表數名入內與勞工處長趙班斧談判，佇候在外之一部份工人，亦欲入內，守門警察加以阻止，致發生衝突。工人情感衝動，竟將勞工處之玻璃窗等搗毀，繳去警察槍械數枝，並有警察五人受傷，一時社會局秩序大亂。警局聞訊後，即出動大批警士全副武裝，到塲彈壓，騎巡隊亦聞聲趕到，社會局門前架設機槍，並由數百名警士分布警衛，形勢甚爲緊張。受傷警察當由救護車車送警察醫院，被繳之槍械經多方勸導後，仍全數追還。但工人不肯離去，僵持許久，呉局長宣局長是時正在出席市政會議，均聞訊趕到，當召集該工人等之代表，分別加以訓話，並　其團毆警察，劫奪槍枝，諸多不合，該工人代表等亦俱引咎，出具悔過書，承認將兇手交出，乃出勞動協會朱學範及勞工處長趙班斧出與全體工人訓話。朱氏首稱：你們當初從重慶來時，勞動協會負責參與其事，抵滬後仍無工作，流落至今，以至今天發生這樣事情，這是我朱學範對不起各位。但今天之事，應該分開二題來講，一是要求復工救濟問題，一是越規行動問題。復工救濟問題，則（一）公大紗廠保證於二星期內修竣，作爲集中收容所，（二）自明日起每人發放救濟麺粉一袋，有家屬者照名册計算，（三）於工作問題未解決前，繼續救濟，並代爲請求政府酌發零用錢，（四）設立處理工潮機構，負責解決復工問題，（五）提議創辦合作工廠，由政府供給機器資金，失業工人參與工作工資不妨稍低，以盈餘充作廠方基金　並由勞工參加管理。關於越軌行動問題，朱氏自言在公對不起政府，在私對不起呉局長。現事已至此，希望能自己認　道歉，一面由本人與趙班斧處長折衝。今日由我負起責任，希望各位聽話回去。繼由勞工處長趙班斧訓話，聲稱　臨參會至今，是否一直爲工人講話，各人明白。而公大紗廠亦是我經三日交涉爭來。今日無他話可說，祗有兩句，第一請各位回去，第二以後事由我和朱學範同志負責解決。朱趙兩氏對工人勸導時，聲淚俱下，失業工人人，多爲感動，遂遵從勸導，整隊退出，由原路經市政府前高呼口號回至外灘始散。但復工問題，猶待各長與有關當局會商解決。</p>

<h3>袁履登坐長監</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕海上〔三老〕之一袁履登，已繼唐壽民之後判處無期徒刑。袁於昨晨九時許提庭時仍衣灰色長袍，下穿黑鞋，精神頹唐，因雙耳重聽，致不得不以右手掩耳，而由庭丁傳語，及聆宣判，面如土色，微微點首。齋推事婉稱可請覆判。退庭時，袁逆喃喃自語，求上帝知其罪過，言次眼眶微紅，其家屬子女旁聽者凡八九人，對袁哭泣不已，且共同向上帝祈禱，而袁逆則免強慰之曰：「不要緊」。（圖示回押時家屬追隨慰藉及袁強作笑容之狀）</p>
<h3>袁履登　坐長監　家屬聞判皆泣下　共同向上帝祈禱</h3>
<p>柳雨生等昨亦定罪</p>

<h3>袁履登案判決書</h3>
<p>事實袁履登係寗紹商輪公司經理，曾任前公共租界工部局華董多年，上海淪陷後袁履登仍聯任僞董，及上海市僞市商會理事長等職。民國三十二年九月，僞南京政府行政院，與敵人聯合，組織米糧統制會，袁履登任主任委員，　南京僞物資統制審議會委員，爲敵購辦米糧，接濟軍需，至三十三年六月底辭職。三十一年二月間，公共租界因受我方志士爆炸，敵寇不安，將租界中心區分爲六大區，實施封鎖，被告憑藉敵僞勢力，組織保甲，自任籌備會主席二月，交出僞警察署，清查戶口，希圖排除我愛國份子，並曾兼任僞新國民運動會委員。抗戰勝利後，經軍事委員會調統局，將其拘獲，移送本院檢察官偵查起訴。</p>
<p>理由被告袁履登，對於先後擔任僞職各情，業已自白不諱。核與其在　　　　查統計局所具自白書相符，並有當時之新聞紙可證，足見其自白，與事實吻合。雖在本院辯稱，僞物資統制審議會及僞新國民運動會，均在南京，雖有僞命，並未出席等語，除僞新國民運動會，尚無積極證據，足爲被告曾經出席之證明外。其僞物資統制審議會，該被告曾經出席，有民國三十二年十一月三日之上海「申報」可稽，已非空書所能飾卸。目據供述，米糧統制會主任，爲物資統制審議會當然委員。則是項報紙之紀載，尤足採爲參證。茲應審究者，即被告有無通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，及其他之罪行是已。查米糧統制會，係僞國民政府與敵人日本雙方混合組織之機構，在名義上雖隸屬於僞行政院，但內有日本委員五人，中國委員五六人，副主任委員二人，一爲陳國權，一爲日人植田賢次郎，迭據被告供述在卷，並有辯護人呈交之第五號證據，（商統法規）載明中日雙方混合組織可爲佐證，在此敵僞合組之機構內，充任主委其有通謀敵國前形，自堪認定。況就被告平日發表之言論觀之，一則曰「目前保衛大東亞戰爭，正在積極展開之際，足食足兵，是立國保國的重要條件，對於大東亞前途的存亡榮辱，更有極密切的關係，本會上承「中央政府」之付託，下受全國民衆的屬望。」（見民國三十二年十月二十日新中國報）再則曰，「現在幸仰仗盟邦主持東亞共榮圈的正義，不勝敬佩，我國於物資上之供應，尤其是主要糧食的源源接濟，實在責無旁貸。」（見三十三年一月十日新中國報）三則曰「中國已參戰了，和盟邦站在一條戰綫上爲擊潰英美而奮鬥」。（見三十四年三月三十一日「申報」四則曰「願繼續勞力，俾吾人向完遂大東亞戰爭之途邁進，」（見三十四年六月五日新中國報）等語。及其　護人所交之第二號證據，（商統會刊）內載米統會配給中日　需米情形，參觀互證。其爲通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，購辦米糧，接濟敵人軍需，益屬毫無疑義。雖據辯稱報載演詞，非其　意，其辯護人且主張係由陳彬龢修改提出第二十二號證據以爲證明，但查該號證據，於民國三十四年十一月出版，在被告被捕多日以後又係私人事後所撰並非被告當年見報後之聲明，已屬無可採取。且查被告演詞中，「尤其是主要糧食的源源接濟，責無旁貸」一語。核與第二號證據內載米糧統制的分配，以中日軍需米爲對象之一，恰相吻合，尤非空言所能狡賴雖又據辯稱，我出任米統會主委之目的有二，（一）爲提高米價，由每石二百元，提高至八百二十元。（二）爲接濟戶口米，治戶口米無着，即行告退，均是有利於人民之行爲云云。不知敵人直接購米，每石給付二百元之低價，勢必激起人民之憤怒，共同抵抗，更能使物資易於逃避，結果終歸失敗，是以有米統會之混合組織，將敵人前此之直接徵購，易爲間接徵購，爲虎作倀，情節顯然。按之懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第五款，其通謀敵國，購辦穀米，更屬證據確鑿。至增加米價，不獨爲敵僞收拾人心抑且便利集中收購均係有利於敵僞，不利於本國之行爲，適足以增其罪行，又接濟戶口米一節，不惟爲數有限，且幾至「斷擋」，曾所被告陳述明確，足徵其採辦糧食係以軍米爲主而置人民戶口米於無足輕重之列欲蓋彌彰更無諉卸罪責之餘地。其因我國志士爆炸租界，敵寇不安，被告籌組保甲，亦據自白不諱。凡在抗戰期間，爲敵僞安定秩序着想者，皆係有利於敵僞之行爲，自屬淺而易見之事。況又憑藉敵僞勢力，　任籌備主席，依同條例第三條之規定，亦無解於圖謀反抗本國之罪責。綜觀被告前後之行爲，除應構成懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪外，並觸犯同條項第五款及第三條之規定，核係基於一個通謀敵國的行爲，雖已觸犯數罪，應從一重處斷。至其辯護人所稱被告於民國三十三年五月辭職，提出虹橋療養院證明書，以爲犯罪在三十三年六月一日以前，合於減刑辦法之主張。核與被告前在軍統局所具自白書，內戰「迨至五月後，又無辦法，決定告退，至六月底始達目的」之語不符。足見被告脫離米統會　關係，確在六月以後，縱使有入院療養之事實，亦不足爲業已解決責任之證明，即不得據爲減刑之理由。　被告通謀敵國圖謀反抗本國，購辦榖米，接濟軍需，情節實屬重大，本應判處極刑，以昭炯戒。惟在犯罪以前，曾救濟難民，平昔品行尚非惡劣，姑且貸其一死，酌處無期徒刑，以中國法。全部財產依法沒收　據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款，第五款，第三條，第八條，第一項，第九條，第一條，刑法第二條第一項前段，第五十五條，第三十七條第一項，判決如主文。</p>

<h3>徐寄廎談糧貸　查核糧商帳册不日公布　如有舞弊情事依法懲辦</h3>
<p>此次糧食部舉辦本市糧商貸款，施行以後，適値糧價波動，因此引起各方揣測。頃據徐議長寄廎談：此次十億元貸款，係屬試辦性質，貸戶之產生，純粹採取推薦辦法。貸款商採運總數約三萬五千石以上。糧貸目的，原在扶助糧商採運能力，藉以疏通本市糧源，而結果乃竟發生四月廿九日米市塲騷擾用武之惡現象，因而決定試辦期滿，即行結束。關於貸款之應用，糧貸辦法中有極詳密之規定，聞除由糧政處憑銷糧報告，派出人員按戶調查外，并由審核會委請公信會計師事務所，專責查核各糧商帳册，貸款糧商有無不合貸款辦法，不日當可公佈。至於貸款商因逢米價陡漲之機會，而獲得之利潤，俟查帳完畢後，再由審核會決定處置辦法。至糧商如有不依照規定辦理，發生舞弊情事，自應依法懲辦云云。</p>

<h3>川糖業考察團抵滬　由台灣遷移兩糖廠入川　在資中內江設示範糖廠</h3>
<p>四川省糖業考察團，近已由渝過京來滬，團長陳讓卿，已於日前飛台，考察專員李　諳，李力民兩氏，亦將往台視察，據李氏云，川省糖產，自經改種印度蔗種後，資（中）內江一帶，蔗產數量漸增，品質亦較好，惟以煉製方法陳舊，致使產額不高，而生產成本亦大，目前所用壓榨設備，祗能壓取蔗中糖質十分之五六、其餘十分之四五則棄之蔗楷中，是項蔗楷尙不敷熬煉糖炭火之用，與山頭用燃料尙差三分之二弱，川糖年產約在五十萬公噸左右，戰時川省汽油缺乏，曾以糖蜜煉酒精而代汽油，今中央為建設新四川，並改進農工生產及技術，故川省府及川中糖業，為求改進川糖生產，陳氏等在京，曾分謁新任經濟部長王義五及資源委員會主委錢昌照，台灣行政長官公署及台糖公司各負責人，陳商改進川糖事宜，經部及資委會亦咸認川糖有改進必要，復商得台省當局之同意，決由合省撤移兩個中型糖廠，遷設川之資內兩地，以為製糖之示範，此兩廠係接收之敵偽產業，一為五百噸，一為三百噸，（壓蔗量），資委會並將是項機器作價投資，而將來該兩廠之廠房建造及營運資金，除川建應撥款投資外，餘則由蔗農與糖業界集資，合組一官商合辦之糖廠，是項製糖機器甚合川省需要，而機器之效能亦較舊有者為高，可提出蔗中糖質百分之九十七八，而蔗楷亦可供熬糖燃料而有餘，故該團此行，首獲中樞允助，赴台將作詳盡之考察與硏究，並擬邀台製糖種蔗專家赴川，共謀改進，彼等並擬俟考察完畢後，即接收該兩廠機器撤運至川，如運輸便利，是項機器本年冬季，即可在川使用，聞川中糖業界近亦發起　組大規模機器製糖廠云。</p>
<h3>吳淞漁汛結束</h3>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>介紹一本　學習英文工具書</h3>
<p>— 童方</p>
<p>學習任何一國語文，最難的不是文法，不是修辭，而是日常單字成語的活用，和各種特殊的習慣用法，而要希望澈底地了解單字成語的活用和特殊的習慣用法，非於閱讀或寫作時特別留意，細觀摩不可。</p>
<p>一國語言有一國語的特殊構造，有一國語言的特殊用法。除非對此有良好的根底，是決不會精通那一國的語言的。我國學生學英文，往往走許多　路，就因為缺乏良好的修習英文的工具書，尤其是缺少專門指示用法的工具書。</p>
<p>競文書局新出一英文用法大字與」，很能彌補這個缺憾。該書英文各A　Ｄtctionary　of　English　Usage，著者葛傳襯是我國唯一的苦學成功的英文學者，著作甚多，現任大同大學敎授。這本書對於單字成語的活用，以及英美語文中特殊的習慣用法，有極詳盡的部析，所引例句頗多，特別指出我國人最易用錯或誤解之處，的確是一部很切合我國學生實際需要的工具書。記得林語堂博士在戰時出版的中學生雜誌中，曾發表一篇關於學習英文方法的文章，也提到習慣用法的問題。但是肯花許多精力編著習慣用法的字典者，至今還少得見到，因此葛先生的這部書便很値得我們重視了。</p>
<p>據著者在序中說，這部大字典的完成，前後費去近十年的功夫，可見著者用力之專。書中用淺顯的中文和簡明的舉例，詳述英文中一切普通單字，習語，結構的正確用法，尤其注意我國學生所易於用錯，誤憫，或種種。誠如著者所說：「牠是中國人專為中國人做的一部唯一的英文用法字典。我說中國人專為中國人做——，是的，我是中國人，用這字典的也都是中國人。祗有中國人（不一定我）才能做出這本或者和這本相似的書；也只有中國人才用得着這類書。」由此可見牠是如何適合中國人的需要了。</p>
<p>著者除參考若干本字典和文法書以外，更參考了許多文學的及非文學的書，他從這許多書中，隨時摘錄比較。最大的優點是不囿於文法家和修辭學家的規律，的確有若干地方是發揮著者獨有的心得的。</p>
<p>我深信修習英文的人，一定能從這本別開生面獨具特點的「英文用法大字典」裏，得到不少幫助。</p>
<p>本書取材於法人韋柏（AWebet）的哲學史（History　of　Peilosophy），並參以他書的精華，但亦不乏著者自己獨特的意見。關於史的叙說方面，年代以公元祀年為主，凡事蹟與整個中國文化有關係者則附以中國年代，以便與中國文化的演進作比較。</p>
<p>在內容方面，著者放眼於哲學史上的大事，詳於書而忽於今，近代哲學叙述到星格爾為止。著者對於這一點是有他的用意的，他認為黑格爾以後，新的哲學體系並沒有能建立起來，有許多哲學家雖亦曾希望自己建立一個哲學系統，然而事實上並未成功，他們的思想至多不過是康德，黑格爾哲學的繼續發揮。同時著者覺得現代距離我們較近，我們易於把握，而古代的哲學思想，則因古代距現得太遠，詳細的叙說一下，或者可以帮助讀者對於渺遠的古代哲學思想有較深切的瞭解。</p>
<p>全書除「導論」外，分三篇來叙述希臘哲學，中古哲學和近代哲學。從這裏面，我們可以看出作為西洋哲學之搖籃的希臘，他們的人民曾過着怎樣的精神生活，以及希臘哲學怎樣繼續在中古發展，再使我們認識到近代人精神生活之淵源及其特徵，科學方法論怎樣確立，一直到哲學發展的現狀。</p>
<p>我感到這本「西洋哲學史」和其他同類書不同的地方就是著者寫作的動機是物合現代人的需要。他認為今日的中國應為「完成現代化」而努力，所謂現代化，說穿了就是西洋化——「由近代西洋科學，技藝，思想，精神所締造的整個文化水準。從而貫通於今日最進步的社會組織，政治機構，生活態度之一切的一切。」的確，西洋近代文化的果實是由古代哲學思想慢慢培育而成的，我們必須追溯到源頭，這是我們必須硏究西洋哲學思想發展的主要原因，也可以說著者就是為了要滿足當前的實際需要而寫這本書的。</p>
<p>所以這本書最大的優點，就是採取中國人的立塲而著述，我們在這本書中可以隨時看到著者所流露的個性——一個中國人的個性。著者為求這本書寫得能够通俗些，時常記着「程氏遺書」中的「凡立言，欲涵蓄意思，不使知德者壓，無德者惑」這幾句話，可見著者已灤味其言而希望做到盡量的通俗。書末附西洋哲學人門書解題十三則，頗有參考的價値。</p>
<h3>讀「中國書論體系及其批評」</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>李長之著</p>
<p>獨立出版社印行以中國論體理論綜合地研究而確立一個體系的著作，在國內出版界中，是並不多見。十年前，劉海粟氏著「申國繪畫上的六法論」（中華版），他是指出了「六法」的理論的核心及其發展，以認識中國書，是一部經科學化的整理之後的巨著，如以瑪爾霍茲（Werner　Mahrhilz）所定的處理學術材料的兩種方法來看，則是屬於歷史的，，至於體系的—哲學的處理中國繪畫理論來認識中國畫的著作，在貧乏的中國學術界裹，這樣一本薄薄的「中國畫論體系及其批評」可說是僅見的。</p>
<p>著者以反對「只可意會」，「不可言傳」的態度來處理整個中國繪畫，而且，他主張運用現代語言來表達，實在是非常可貴的。</p>
<p>本書的立論，以宋元時代藝術為中心，因為著者確認中國畫是以宋元人為登峯造極。</p>
<p>全書提出下面四個問題，作綜合地認識中國畫的具體方法。</p>
<p>（一）中國繪畫上之主觀問題。</p>
<p>（二）中國繪畫上之對象問題。</p>
<p>（三）中國繪書上之用具問題。</p>
<p>（四）中國繪書中之一般的藝術問題。</p>
<p>應用康德：「壯美的東西必須時時是大的，優美的東西却可以是小的。壯美的東西必須是單純簡凈的，優美的東西確可以加上塗飾，點綴。」及「年長一點的人是多有一些壯美性的，年幼的人則多有一些優美的成分。」以及溫克耳曼：「由單純與統」，一切優美性轉而為壯美。」等的美學理論，總結地來斷定中國繪畫是壯美的，男性的。這種說法雖然並不完全正確，但也不可不斷定是著者的獨到之處。，</p>
<p>在「結論」中，著者又確定：「中國畫是有絕大價値，有永久價値的，然而同時我覺得它沒有前途，而且已經過去了。」這也是相當正確的。</p>
<p>不過，中國書的發生發展的社會原因，以及構成「壯美」，「男性」，「絕大價値」，「永久價値」，「沒有前途」，「已經過去」的社會原因，都不曾加以體察，因之，著者則能抽象地引用一種美學上的理念來比擬做論斷，這不得不承認是本書的缺點。</p>
<h3>介紹鄭著警官用書</h3>
<p>— 楊國楨</p>
<p>從前有兩句話說得好：「書到用時方恨少，事非經過不知難」。警察書籍在勝利以前，久未事非經過不知難」。警察書籍在勝利以前，久未為一般警官所注意：到了勝利之後，似乎覺得應該不是那不學無術的做官時代了，多數警官要改革一切，就急得到處搜求警書，尤其是那警界鼎鼎大名鄭宗楷先生的書，不容易購得。好書直到如今才開始感覺重要，好人到了何時才開始感覺寳貴呢？我物色了半年以上，好容易在京滬警界友人處找到了鄭著幾種，現介紹紹如下，以吿知全國警察界的朋友。</p>
<p>（一）警察法總論（初版本及重版本）——此為鄭宗楷先生在戰前中央警官學校執敎鞭時所作的，在抗戰初期，送由商務印書館發交香港廠印行，內容方面，沒有重版本豐富。重版本是他担任戰時重慶巿警察局幕僚長時所完成的，他以新鮮活的經騐來從事增刪修改，其中關於見解與評論，頗値得讀者參考。所附錄之「戰時及戰後改革行政大綱，」更不以警察一行為限，在吾國今後整個行政上有指導價値；可惜他把這東西放在警察　總論中，不容易使大人物看到。該書現不在京滬各地發行，必須到重慶白象街商務印書館，才能買到。</p>
<p>（二）現代警察之理論與實際——這是鄭先生在重慶大轟炸時送交正中書局出版的，內容包羅甚廣，相當充實；獨惜其中有一部份，時過境遷，不切實用了。這些東西，隔時稍久，恐怕不大為讀者所歡迎，但是大都份的東西，還可供讀者作進修之用，這是不完全切合實用的一種書。</p>
<p>（三）警官巡羅勤務論——也是正中書局重慶版，全是演講稿子，由大學生筆記的。該書對於警察分局改革外勤，頗有幫助；但是泰半取材於英美，對中國是否應該實行「警管區」一層，則閉口不提。該項演說詞，內容甚有趣，講者的確有學問，絕不是空洞的說話。該書對警察總局督察處人員及各分局人員，頗有益處。</p>
<p>（四）警察動員概論——此書版本很大，頁數却很少，是其缺點。鄭光生在七匕事變時，他趕作此稿送到上海商務印書館出書，後才隨着政府西遷。讀書雖無可以推獎之處，然在出版界不失為比較新奇的一種。</p>
<p>（五）警官辦案手册——此書由正中書局發行重慶版，卷首有今首都高等法院趙院長琛以序文一篇，</p>
<p>其中曰：「吾友鄭宗楷，以新著警官辦案手冊徵序於余，余披閱一過，雖僅寥寥數萬言，而其內容所包甚廣，舉凡刑法，刑事訴訟法，監獄學，犯罪學，刑事政策，法醫學審判，心理學，偵探學，指紋學及犯罪偵查法等刑事法學之知識，無不提綱紫領，有扼要之敘述，鄭君豈僅警察學之權威，更不愧為刑事法學之專家。……」因為辦案要用它，當然為一般警官所歡迎。該書的好處，能令讀者習得辦理違警及偵査刑事案件的系統知識。據警界人士說：警察的書，有許都多人不是他自己作的，而由他人代庖；鄭宗楷所作的書，千眞萬確是他本人作的。</p>

<h3>The Ministry of National Defense Officially Established Today; Commander-in-Chief He Sends a Circular Telegram Declaring His Resignation; Hopes His Comrades-in-Arms Will Work Hard to Lay the Foundation for Military Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army officially announced its closure on the 31st. General He Yingqin, Chief of Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, First Class, issued a special circular telegram to all company commanders, theater commanders, pacification directors, group army commanders, and all soldiers of the nation, declaring that he would relinquish both positions from June 1st. He also stated two matters: first, he recounted that in the past sixteen years, he had served as Minister of Military Affairs for fourteen years and eight months, Chief of Staff for over eight years, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army for two and a half years. He expressed boundless gratitude for the assistance of leaders and staff at all levels, as well as all comrades-in-arms, which enabled the smooth implementation of all plans for military reorganization, construction, resistance against Japan, acceptance of surrender, and repatriation of prisoners. He then said: The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense on the 1st is a new central military organization, and it is an extremely reasonable organization with simple organization, appropriate coordination, and solid connections. It is expected to achieve excellent results. All my comrades-in-arms should unanimously support it and work hard to promote it in order to lay the foundation for national military construction. He sincerely hoped that all comrades-in-arms would carry forward the spirit of loving the country, loving the people, taking responsibility, and observing discipline to complete the great revolutionary cause and not fail the high expectations of the Supreme Commander, Chairman Chiang. It is heard that national leaders at all levels, upon learning of General He Yingqin's relinquishment of his heavy military responsibilities, felt reluctant to part with him, as a result of their comradely feelings. Telegrams and letters have poured in from various locations, all hoping that General He would lead the Supreme Strategic Advisory Committee, praise the commander, and complete the great plans of military and national construction.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 31st] Bai Chongxi left Ping by plane at 1:00 PM today to return to Nanjing to preside over the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army was approved to be abolished on May 31st due to the completion of its mission. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin took a group photo with more than 700 officers in front of the headquarters hall at 10:00 AM as a souvenir. Subsequently, a tea party was held. After Commander-in-Chief He earnestly encouraged the officers, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Li Huang followed with a speech. Finally, Chief of Staff Yi Su made a speech, and the meeting was adjourned. Regarding the future of the officers of the Army Headquarters, it is learned that the Second, Third, and Fourth Bureaus, as well as the Artillery, Engineering, and Communications Commands, will be merged into the Ministry of Military Operations. The Military Law Execution Supervisory Department will be merged into the Military Law Division of the Ministry of Military Administration. The Foreign Affairs Department will be merged into the Rear Service Headquarters. The First Bureau, as well as the General Affairs, Health, and Management Bureaus, will all be abolished. In addition to the officers mentioned above who are being merged or transferred to the Beiping Mediation Executive Headquarters and the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters, the civilian personnel will be sent back to their hometowns. The remaining officers will enter the temporary officer corps.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Ministry of National Defense will be officially established on June 1st and will begin operations at the original site of the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army. Various departments and bureaus are actively making arrangements.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 31st] Chairman Chiang remained in Beiping today to rest and provide instructions to the local military and political leaders. In the morning, he first summoned the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, Bai Chongxi, and instructed him to return to Nanjing to preside over the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense. In the morning, he then summoned Zheng Daoru, the Chairman of Jilin Province, who had just rushed over from Shenyang, and instructed him on matters related to the takeover of Jilin. Zheng received a phone call from the Chairman's Beiping Headquarters last night, ordering him to arrive in Beiping by 10:00 AM today. Zheng arrived at 10:20 AM. He claimed that the plane had experienced a malfunction and repeatedly mentioned the danger. The weather in the Northeast has been bad for several days. Yesterday, when Chairman Chiang's special plane, the Meiling, passed Shanhaiguan, hailstones suddenly fell, and the fuselage shook violently. Madam Chiang also vomited on her way from Shenyang to Beiping yesterday. Therefore, no guests were seen earlier today. In addition, the Chairman also summoned Sun Lianzhong this morning and listened to his report for a long time. In the afternoon, he only summoned two people. One was Cai Wenzhi, the Government Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, whom he summoned at 3:00 PM. At 9:00 PM, he summoned the senior leaders of Beiping City for a conversation. Because of the short time and busy schedule, the headquarters issued a message this morning, ordering all those who wish to meet the Chairman to first register at the Beiping Garrison Headquarters and wait to be summoned. This morning, the reporter saw Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Zhang Ting'e, Du Jianshi, Mu Tingfang, Fu Sinian, He Qigong, Li Sicong, Wu Juanren, Shao Hua, and others successively arriving at the garrison headquarters to leave their business cards and return to their residences to await summons. Before leaving, the reporter made an appointment with Zheng Yanfen, a member of the Chairman's entourage, to meet again at 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The Chairman seems unlikely to leave Beiping tomorrow. After the reporter left the garrison gate, he saw an old woman in her seventies, the director of a certain division's field hospital, Xue, crying because her residence had been forcibly occupied. She sought to meet the Chairman and was persuaded to leave a written statement and leave.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 31st] Chairman Chiang processed official business and reviewed documents at the garrison headquarters on the morning of the 31st. At 5:00 PM, he summoned the Mayor of Beiping, Xiong Bin, and inquired about the general municipal situation, especially the work of the Health Bureau. The Chairman was particularly concerned about the appearance of Beiping City. After listening to Mayor Xiong's report, he believed that the appearance of Beiping City had improved compared to his visit last winter and instructed Mayor Xiong that the city government should cooperate with the citizens in the future and pay special attention to public health, hoping that every citizen can follow the principles of the New Life Movement and practice a neat and clean life. After summoning Mayor Xiong, the Chairman immediately led Mayor Xiong from the garrison headquarters to inspect the new urban area in the western suburbs for a week, returning to the garrison headquarters around 7:00 PM. The new urban area was planned and built by the Japanese in the western suburbs during their occupation of Beiping, designed and built according to modern urban planning. It is large in scale, but only a part was completed by the time the Japanese surrendered.</p>

<h3>A Letter of Complaint from the Citizens of Shenyang; The Chairman Will Personally Review It After Returning to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 31st] The reporter paid a visit to the Chairman this morning, but due to official business, he was met by Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen. Zheng only answered questions about the Party and groups under his responsibility and the handling of confidential letters. He said that the Party and groups in the nine northeastern provinces have all been assigned dedicated personnel, but due to environmental constraints, most cannot formally operate. Only the Party and groups in Liaoning can be promoted. The Chairman set up a confidential complaint box in Shenyang this time and received more than 900 letters of complaint. After bringing them to Nanjing, they will be processed. The Chairman will personally review them one by one and then hand them over to the judicial organs. Zheng also said that many outsiders mistakenly believe that reporting to the Chairman is like "reporting to the emperor," which is incorrect. The Chairman's move is primarily to learn more about the hidden suffering of the people and seek effective relief, but it should still follow judicial procedures. Therefore, each case is handed over to the judicial organs for thorough and swift handling. The lawsuit received from Chairman Li Ping last time has not been completed by the Beiping Court. It has been ordered for the court to speed up the handling.</p>

<h3>National Army Arrives Near the Suburbs of Harbin; Communist Troops Retreating Towards Qiqihar</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] Military News: The 7,000-strong rapid force of the National Army advancing towards Harbin arrived at the southeastern suburbs, only 11 Chinese miles away from Harbin, at dawn today and occupied two high grounds. After a slight resistance, the Communist troops retreated. According to news from the Northeast, the National Army is now awaiting orders to peacefully enter Harbin. The Communist troops have already begun to withdraw. Currently, what the Communist troops are contesting is nothing more than the following two things: (1) a matter of face. The Communist troops still intend to strive for an active withdrawal in order to consolidate morale and cover up signs of defeat. (2) A practical matter. The Communist troops seem to hope to obtain guarantees from Marshal Ma or other parties and conditionally withdraw from Harbin in order to ensure their territory north of the Songhua River.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] According to a foreign military expert who recently came here from the Northeast: In the battles in the Northeast, from Benxihu to Sipingjie and Gongzhuling, the main force of the Communist troops has lost 60,000 people. Among them, those who were killed or wounded accounted for about a quarter, less than 20,000 people. Most of the Communist officers and soldiers deserted with or abandoned their weapons during the retreat. The so-called Democratic Allied Army has actually been defeated and disorganized. Captured Communist officers and soldiers said: When Lin Biao and Zhou Baozhong gave their last speech in Sipingjie and Changchun, they also publicly admitted that in the past ten years or more of thousands of battles, large and small, although there were occasional deserters, such unfortunate phenomena as fleeing before the battle, collapsing before being defeated, and dispersing after defeat will be the first time this has occurred. The morale of the Communist troops in the Northeast has almost been completely crushed. The Communist troops do not hesitate to travel thousands of miles, using coercion to hastily form an army, with soldiers having no fighting spirit and filled with complaints. It is appropriate to have such a loss. What is pitiful is that most of these tens of thousands of retreating Communist troops are innocent people from Hubei, northern Anhui, southern Henan, northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, and southern Hebei, who were coerced and deceived, causing them to abandon their wives and children and wander thousands of miles. How can they bear it? Therefore, as soon as the Communist troops heard that the Central Government had sent personnel to various places in the Northeast to comfort and rescue the refugees, they mostly returned with their weapons. The evolution of the war situation to this point shows that the trend of superiority and inferiority has become clear, and the unification of the Northeast can be expected soon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Changchun, 31st] According to responsible sources, the New Sixth Army of the National Army crossed the upper reaches of the Songhua River yesterday and arrived at a certain place a few miles northeast of Jilin City. Other units of the army are advancing along the railway northeast of Changchun, crossing Zhangjiawan yesterday and arriving at the banks of the Songhua River, about eight miles southwest of Harbin. The Chinese Communist troops are retreating towards Qiqihar.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Changchun, 30th] (Delayed) According to headquarters sources obtained here today, the National Army has occupied a vast security circle, with a radius extending in the east, west, and north directions, about eighty miles around Changchun, making it impossible for the Communist troops to launch a counterattack on Changchun again. Since May 28th, Jilin has been firmly in the hands of the National Army. Occupying Dehui to the north, about sixty miles from Changchun, is a railway town, where the National Army has reached the south bank of the Songhua River. The Songhua River is twenty miles north of Changchun, almost halfway between Changchun and Harbin.</p>

<h3>At the American Alumni Association Meeting in This City, Sun Ke Elaborates on Legislative Procedures and Explains the Company Law and Land Law Respectively</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, at the invitation of the American Alumni Association of this city, attended a dinner party held by the association at the Dadong Restaurant yesterday and delivered a speech on the spot. Those present at the dinner included Mayor Wu, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government He Dekui, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengyu, Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang, Commander of the U.S. Forces in China Major General Gillon, U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Davis, U.S. Judge Hale Mick, etc. After the meal, Association President Smith first delivered a welcome speech and introduced President Sun's resume. Then, President Sun rose to give a speech, briefly stating: "It is a great honor to gather here today with old and new friends. I have served as the President of the Legislative Yuan for fourteen years, so today I would like to briefly express my views on Chinese legislation and legislative procedures." Sun stated: "Up to now, the members of the Legislative Yuan are still appointed by the government. Any legal bill passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government becomes law." Sun then explained the difference between "law" and "decree" and cited the new Company Law and Land Law, explaining them separately. Regarding the provision in the draft of the new Company Law that foreign companies must also be operating in their own country if they wish to operate in China, he gave a brief explanation, saying: "This provision has been removed from the promulgated new Company Law." The new Company Law includes the old laws and regulations related to company law. When discussing the Land Law, he said: "This law has provisions for land ownership and taxation. I recently heard that Shanghai is considering levying a 40% tax on real estate transactions based on their transaction price. This has caused real estate transactions to become sluggish. However, this tax provision is not fully consistent with the provisions of the Land Law, so if it is submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, it will be rejected." Sun earnestly hoped that local authorities should carefully study the Land Law before formulating similar measures to avoid causing losses to the people. Sun then talked about the legislative procedure, saying: "The National Government, the Supreme National Defense Council, the various Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan itself can all propose bills to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Legislative Yuan currently has five committees: Legal System, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, and Military Affairs. When discussing a proposal, each committee often invites those related to the proposal to attend the discussion. The Legislative Yuan has the power to pass or reject it." Sun then stated: "In the future, after the National Assembly is convened and the constitution is formulated, the members of the Legislative Yuan will be elected by the provinces and cities in proportion to their population. The number of members will be approximately five to six hundred. The future Legislative Yuan will be even more important than it is now. Most of the major national policies of the Executive Yuan must be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. If rejected by the Legislative Yuan, it would be tantamount to the Legislative Yuan casting a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan would have to be reorganized. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan under the new constitution is quite similar to the House of Commons in England."</p>
<h3>Optimistic about the Northeast Issue, Hoping for a Speedy Adjustment of Civil Servants' Salaries</h3>
<p>Sun then discussed the system of party governance, briefly stating: "In the past, the Kuomintang led the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, completed the Northern Expedition, and resisted foreign aggression. During this period of political tutelage, when the party governs the country, the Kuomintang has taken a leadership position. However, all aspects of construction remain to be undertaken, and the Kuomintang cannot take everything into account at once. However, it has been working hard to complete the most important tasks. For example, the most important thing in the past fifteen years has been to resist Japanese aggression. Fortunately, a favorable outcome has been achieved. From now on, the government is determined to gradually return power to the people. Therefore, it earnestly hopes that the current domestic disputes can be resolved through political means. Resorting to force unnecessarily is not a good policy." Speaking of the situation in the Northeast, he said, "When the Soviet army withdrew from the Northeast, it informed the National Government in advance. Therefore, only the National Government has full authority to recover the Northeast. If it were to recognize the occupation of the Northeast by local troops and the establishment of their own government, it would be tantamount to recognizing that the domestic government administration has been divided and that two governments have been formed externally. Moreover, China and the Soviet Union already have a Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. According to this treaty, China allows the Soviet Union to hold half of its interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway and stipulates the joint use of Lushun Port, as well as granting the Soviet Union special privileges in Dalian. All of these provisions must be implemented after the National Government recovers the Northeast. If the Soviet Union recognizes the occupation of the Northeast by local troops and the establishment of a separate government, it would be tantamount to destroying the existing Sino-Soviet Friendship Agreement. In short, the National Government, as the only government representing China, must have absolute power to receive the Northeast." Sun believes that the Northeast issue must be resolved, but a peaceful solution should be sought. He advocates that the Communist forces should immediately find a way to make concessions to the government, and everything can be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion. He finally stated: "I am very optimistic about the future of the Northeast issue" and added, "It is expected to be resolved in the short term. I hope everyone will work hard to make it happen."</p>
<p>After the meeting, reporters asked Sun when the adjustment of civil servants' salaries would be decided. Sun replied, "It is still under review." When it will be decided, he could not say. He only said, "I hope it will be as soon as possible." He also said that he will return to Nanjing in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency report from this city] President Sun is very concerned about the future of Chinese industry and commerce and expresses his worries, because the cost of domestic products is rising, which has led to sluggish exports and even stagnation. Sun believes that if the national finances are not in difficulty, export merchants should be encouraged and their cost differences should be subsidized to facilitate the export of domestic products. However, this is currently difficult to do. The second is to reduce production costs and stabilize finance and prices. Price increases harm the people, so future economic and financial matters should accept opinions from all parties and be discussed openly. This is a man-made problem, and I believe it can be solved by man-made means.</p>

<h3>Labor Unrest and the Rule of Law</h3>
<p>Labor unrest has been surging in Shanghai in recent months, one wave after another, affecting industrial production and social order, and the situation is gradually becoming serious. Yesterday, more than a thousand unemployed workers rioted at the Social Affairs Bureau, injuring people, damaging property, and seizing guns from the police, setting a new precedent for labor unrest. Fortunately, the authorities responded effectively and prevented an accident. However, according to the workers' claims, they have prepared coffins and stretchers, indicating that a small number of people are deliberately creating trouble and inciting tragedy. This kind of labor unrest is no longer purely economic.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting of factory owners at the Chamber of Commerce this afternoon. Minister Gu and Mayor Wu will both be present to provide guidance. A meeting of leaders of various trade unions was previously convened, and Mayor Wu and Minister Gu both gave instructions, announcing the government's important policies for handling labor unrest. Minister Gu pointed out four principles: (1) Workers' legitimate interests should be protected; (2) Labor discipline must be rectified; (3) Labor-management disputes should be handled in accordance with legal procedures; (4) Wage adjustments should be based on the cost of living index promulgated by the municipal government, and the base wage should not be changed. If the wages of various industries cannot be paid according to the cost of living index due to poor production or business, the labor and management should negotiate, or the arbitration committee should agree on a method to reduce the wages. Mayor Wu also announced five points for handling labor unrest: (1) Strikes and slowdowns are not allowed; (2) Instigators of labor unrest will be severely punished; (3) If there are strikes or slowdowns, wages will not be paid during the strike or slowdown period, and no demands may be made in any name; (4) Those who instigate labor unrest and collect commissions will be severely punished; (5) Workers should absolutely abide by discipline. We really hope that the publication of these measures will mark the beginning of the end of the Shanghai labor unrest, but unexpectedly, yesterday, unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear staged a "full martial arts performance," which seems to have caused embarrassment to the authorities.</p>
<p>Those who discuss labor unrest often emphasize the economic point of view, believing that the continuous increase in the cost of living makes it difficult for wage earners to make a living. This is indeed a fair argument. However, now that the government takes into account the livelihood of workers and adopts wage adjustments based on the cost of living index, whether this policy is completely reasonable is open to discussion, but the wages paid according to the cost of living index should be able to maintain the current standard of living. Therefore, if workers are not unemployed, there should be no labor unrest. Yesterday, someone said that during the occupation period, the price of rice in Shanghai reached 800,000 yuan per picul of false currency, and the average wage of workers was about 100,000 yuan per month, which was not enough to buy one and a half dou of rice. Now, even if the price of rice is 60,000 yuan, and the average wage is about 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, which is enough to buy two piculs of rice, why is there more labor unrest than during the occupation period, and why is it getting worse day by day? Therefore, the ups and downs of labor unrest cannot be fully explained by economic factors.</p>
<p>Moreover, even from an economic point of view, setting wages based on the cost of living index is naturally out of the government's intention to care for workers, but there are several points that are also worth our attention: (1) Under the current situation where the cost of living index has risen to more than 4,000 times the pre-war level, workers can indeed receive wages based on the cost of living index, but civil servants, who have worked hard for the country day and night, have traveled back and forth to the rear during the war, and have endured hardships for eight or nine years, are now only receiving 50,000 yuan plus 160 times their base salary. Compared with the situation where workers' wages have increased by 3,000 to 4,000 times, Chinese workers today are no longer the people who are suffering the most. (2) The increase in wages will undoubtedly affect the rising cost of production. At present, it is difficult for the manufactured products of our country's production sector to compete with cheap and high-quality imported products. If this situation is allowed to continue, China's industry and even the entire national economy will eventually go bankrupt. (3) With wages based on the cost of living index, workers can live according to the pre-war standard, but in terms of work efficiency, not to mention progress, can it really reach the pre-war standard? If work efficiency cannot keep up with the pre-war standard, but wages are the same as the pre-war remuneration, or even higher due to the increase in base salary, can employers afford it in the long run? This kind of "killing the chicken to get the eggs" labor unrest is not only harmful to the future of Chinese industry, but even tantamount to suicide for the labor community!</p>
<p>Investigating the origins of this kind of blind labor unrest's crazy actions, its initial departure was based on economics, but at present it is obvious that it has political implications. Some conspirators are taking advantage of the opportunity, deliberately creating and expanding social unrest in order to achieve their political goals. Workers do not understand the role of this, or blindly agree, or succumb to the power of some instigators, so that they are directed and manipulated by a small number of people, and they themselves may be at a loss. The recent surge in labor unrest is mostly due to instigation and coercion. At Mayor Wu's reception for journalists the other day, someone pointed out that in the recent rickshaw pullers' strike, agitators sent from northern Jiangsu wielded knives specifically to puncture rickshaw tires, forcibly preventing rickshaw pullers from pulling their cars. Yesterday's editorial in the North-China Daily News also warned Shanghai workers, saying that past labor unrest in Shanghai was mostly triggered by agitators with other purposes, whose purpose was not to protect the interests of workers but to break workers' rice bowls, making it so that everyone had nothing to eat. Therefore, those who truly care for workers sincerely hope that Shanghai workers will rein in their horses on the edge of the cliff and never blindly agree with the instructions of these agitators; and hope that the government authorities will not speak casually in the future, otherwise, once the policy is announced, it must be seriously implemented and severely punish the rioters who disrupt social order.</p>
<p>At this point, we once again feel something deeply. Even if we take a hundred steps back or a thousand steps back and assume that strikes and slowdowns are legal, destroying stores, factory equipment, or injuring people to the point of death or injury as a result of strikes and slowdowns is ultimately not tolerated by the law. Recently, in labor unrest, there have been incidents of destroying stores and injuring people. Yesterday, even the workers stormed the Social Affairs Bureau, which is too much! Indeed, workers' unemployment is very painful, and we deeply sympathize with them. The government and society should especially strive to provide job opportunities and continue to provide relief, but in any case, they should not prepare coffins and cause deaths. We must not let this trend continue! If this trend is not curbed, then no one will be interested in industrial and commercial production, and the national law will be completely gone. This kind of violence is mostly organized and on a considerable scale. It progresses gradually, expands gradually, and is not an isolated incident of one or two people. If small problems are not blocked, they will become rivers. We hope that the relevant authorities will stop the occurrence of violence in order to maintain the people's peace and prosperity. Because violence is definitely not what ordinary labor unrest should have.</p>
<p>In short, the development of labor unrest in Shanghai to the current stage has become a situation where economic factors are few and political implications are strong. We should sympathize with and relieve the economic suffering of workers; but we should unceremoniously point out and correct the political blind actions of workers. Pure union members must know that if they continue to act blindly and violently, it is less about fighting for the interests of the workers themselves and more about increasing social unrest, disrupting public order, and endangering national survival. Workers are originally the cornerstone of national construction, and they must never be used as a tool to harm the country by ambitious people!</p>
<h3>Lin Bosheng Sentenced to Death, Face Turned Pale Upon Hearing the Sentence, Forcing Himself to Remain Calm</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Capital High Court sentenced the traitor Lin Bosheng to death this morning. Judge Jin Shiding, Prosecutor He Zhongjin, Judge Tian Hongming, and Clerk He Fu [blank] attended the court. At 10:30 AM, Lin the traitor was brought to the court. After questioning his age, address, and residence, the sentence was pronounced in court. Lin Bosheng was found guilty of colluding with the enemy to conspire against the country, and was sentenced to death with deprivation of public rights for life. All of his property, except for what was necessary for the living expenses of his family, was confiscated. The reasoning: the defendant Lin the traitor Bosheng echoed Wang the traitor Zhaoming, resisted the established national policy of the central government, independently advocated peace, published Wang the traitor's sensational telegram, and responded to Konoe's statement. Although he was attacked by patriotic soldiers, the defendant remained unrepentant, participated in the puppet National Congress, discussed the peace issue, and then Wang and others jointly organized the puppet government, holding important party and government positions. He also participated in the Greater East Asia Youth Guidance Council with Wang. Other meetings, such as the Treaty on Basic Relations between China and Japan, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, which opposed Britain and the United States and declared war on the Allied countries, expressing the intention to live and die with the Japanese invaders, were all attended by the defendant. Moreover, as the propaganda minister in the puppet government, he repeatedly praised the Japanese invaders and slandered the central government in newspapers and broadcasts, and published anti-resistance war remarks. In his book "From September 18th to September 18th," he did everything possible to slander and slander the Supreme Commander and the national policy, shaking the resistance war and disturbing people's hearts. The evidence of his crimes is conclusive and leaves no doubt, so he is sentenced to capital punishment. After hearing the sentence, Lin the traitor's face turned pale, but he still forced himself to remain calm and said that he was willing to give up the application for a retrial, and expressed his gratitude to the presiding judge. Finally, the presiding judge instructed him, saying, "Although you do not apply for a retrial, the High Court will still apply for a retrial on your behalf according to the law." After saying this, he ordered him to be taken back into custody.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 30th Dispatch] A high-ranking naval officer who previously served as Under Secretary of the Army Department today strongly condemned the Soviet Union's obstruction of peace efforts. He stated that the hasty demobilization of the US military has weakened the United States' influence in international conferences. Former Army Department official, [James Forrestal], warned in a broadcast that "a new sinister hand may be extended, attempting to conquer the world, and we will have no peace. The great alliance that defeated Hitler's forces has now vanished, and a totalitarian force with a different symbol than the Nazi swastika has risen in its place."

It was stated that "America cannot achieve prosperity without expanding the world economy, and there can be no security without striving for world security through the United Nations. American foreign policy is based on this firm belief.

<h3>Britain Helps France Strengthen Air Force, Two Countries Have Established Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, [Hector McNeil], recently declared in the House of Commons that Britain and France have now established an agreement stipulating that Britain will greatly strengthen the French Air Force, aviation industry, and naval aircraft capabilities. A "New York Times" reporter noted that this action by Britain coincides with the United States' decision to assist in arming Latin American countries. However, the Anglo-French negotiations have been ongoing for some time, and the motivation is clearly that both countries wish to strengthen the armaments of their allies. One thing to note is that the Anglo-French alliance negotiations are still at a standstill, with no new developments since the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. According to [McNeil], Britain will provide France and French aviation schools with aircraft and equipment under the agreement, as well as radio, radar, and signal equipment. British aviation schools and instructors will also train French personnel in the use of British equipment, and French aircraft factories will be allowed to manufacture British aircraft, engines, and various parts.</p>
<h3>Einstein's Speech: Seeking World Peace in the Future, US and Soviet Union Must Establish Agreement, Criticizes America for Going in the Opposite Direction</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 30th Dispatch] Dr. Albert Einstein delivered a radio address from his home today, stating that to seek world peace in the future, a large-scale agreement must be established with the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, since the end of the war, the United States has gone in the opposite direction. If we want to protect the world from destruction in the future, the only hope lies in seeking peace through supranational means. We must create a world government capable of resolving conflicts between nations through judicial means. The development of political relations among countries in the year since the end of World War II has clearly failed to bring us closer to this goal. The United Nations organization, as it stands today, has neither the military power nor the legal basis to achieve a state of international security. If a large-scale agreement could be established between the United States and the Soviet Union, then these two powers alone would be enough to compel other countries to relinquish some sovereignty, so that all nations could achieve military security. Now, the United States has not only not made efforts to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, but has even gone in the opposite direction.</p>

<h3>Emperor Hirohito Travels Lightly, Pays Second Visit to MacArthur Yesterday, Talks Last One Hour, Content Strictly Secret, Imperial Household Ministry Denies Connection to Abdication Issue</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] Emperor Hirohito today made a second sudden visit to MacArthur at the US Embassy, MacArthur's residence, for a secret talk lasting one and a half hours. Hirohito, dressed in casual clothes, left the palace at 10:05 AM and drove to the US Embassy, a ten-minute journey. Grand Chamberlain Matsudaira accompanied him, but there was no escort. Upon arriving at the embassy, Hirohito immediately spoke privately with MacArthur, with only one interpreter present, and the contents of the conversation were kept strictly secret. The Emperor's visit comes at a time of upheaval in Japan, with the people in turmoil due to food shortages domestically, and the Soviet Union repeatedly criticizing Hirohito from abroad. All of this may be the subject of this discussion. In addition, the main Japanese war criminals will be formally tried in three days, which may also be related. The Emperor's previous visit to MacArthur was on September 27th of last year, after which Hirohito's authority plummeted. Today's visit to MacArthur will likely not cause the same outrage among the Japanese people as the first time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st Special Dispatch] The Imperial Household Ministry denied that Emperor Hirohito's 90-minute visit to MacArthur this morning was in any way related to the issue of abdication.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th Dispatch] The French High Commissioner to Vietnam recently issued an official report stating that French troops entered Siam on Friday of last week to pursue thugs. French troops only stayed in Siam for three hours and suffered slight casualties, with three Siamese soldiers killed or wounded. The incident was caused by about 50 to 80 thugs from Laos and Annam, who gathered some Siamese people and robbed a certain place in Laos along the Mekong River, so French troops pursued them. The Siamese government seems to be instigating them, with the suspicion of disturbing world sentiments, it is said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] The Siamese Information Office in England issued a statement saying that Siam has been accused of engaging in major provocations, but its cities and villages have been subjected to heavy shelling.

<h3>Associated Press Correspondent in Soviet Union Talks About US-Soviet Relations: Soviet Side Believes Anglo-American Bloc Certainly Exists, Suspicion Increases, Difficult to Achieve Understanding</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 30th Dispatch] Associated Press correspondent Gilbert, stationed in Moscow for five years, recently returned to the country for vacation. Gilbert's wife is Russian, and he himself speaks Russian, giving him unique and insightful observations on Soviet affairs, incomparable to those who can only scratch the surface. The following is a record of his remarks on US-Soviet relations after returning home:</p>
<p>Although Secretary of State Byrnes stated that an Anglo-American bloc was not organized to oppose the Soviet Union, the general opinion on the Soviet side is that such a bloc certainly exists, it was so in the past, and it is so now. No matter how sincere the words, they can never eliminate this belief. The Anglo-American envoys in Moscow are well aware of this belief in the Soviet Union and often find it difficult to cope with, so both sides try their best to avoid it. Even recently, when the new US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, [Walter Bedell] Smith, arrived, several senior British expatriates intended to go to the airport to welcome him as usual, but the person in charge said, "It won't do. We cannot give the Soviet Union the impression that we are welcoming a new baseball hitter to the ballpark." The British, with good intentions, stayed home. The fact that the British and Americans speak the same language is also an unfortunate factor contributing to misunderstanding. Russians never know what the British and Americans are saying to each other, just like spectators in a ball game who do not know what the referees and players are saying to each other. One day, the reporter saw three or five British and Americans huddled together at a diplomatic banquet in Moscow, reciting poems to each other, while several Russians standing ten feet away were convinced that they were being mocked. Another time, I heard Russians discussing a new brand of cigarettes, while the British and Americans stood asking each other, "What are they doing?"</p>
<p>During the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Anglo-American advisory groups were careful to avoid the Soviet Union suspecting them of any joint action. When we reporters told Soviet friends about this, they invariably replied, "Of course, you have a guilty conscience, you feel trapped." Suspicion of organizing blocs has developed to this extent.</p>
<p>Eighteen months ago, when commenting on this issue, the reporter sent a telegram saying, "The Russians believe there are ten anti-Soviet partnerships between the British and Americans." The censor insisted on changing the wording to "The Russians hope that the British and Americans do not have any partnership against the Soviet Union." Twelve months later, the reporter emphasized this even more, and the telegram was passed by the censor. Since former British Prime Minister Churchill delivered his speech in Missouri, if anyone telegraphed that the Russians do not believe that a partnership is in progress, I do not believe it could have been easily passed by the censor.</p>
<p>US Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower and Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz recently testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that the land and naval forces of the Western Hemisphere must cooperate, which of course sparked new suspicions. Eisenhower said, "Anyone looking at the globe can see that the shortest air route from Europe or Asia to the United States is through the Arctic." Upon hearing this, the Russians will inevitably become more alarmed. They will ask, "Who else is in Europe or Asia besides us?" Most people will also go on to ask, "This is the shortest route from the United States to Europe and Asia, but who has the atomic bomb?" In addition, the entire Western Hemisphere collective defense plan will undoubtedly spark intense discussion among Soviet authorities.</p>
<p>The reporter is speaking frankly, only wanting to express the Soviet viewpoint. Today, Russians are muttering to themselves, and even openly stating, that not only does a certain country oppose and reject the Soviet Union's policies towards certain European countries, but it is now escalating things, advocating for military cooperation between the United States and South American countries. In Soviet eyes, if this is not foolish, it must be extreme hypocrisy.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Workers from the Rear Arriving in Shanghai Petition for Re-employment, Resulting in Riots; Five Police Officers Injured at the Social Affairs Bureau; Zhu Xuefan and Zhao Banfu Moved to Tears During Admonishment</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Private factories that relocated inland during the war successively closed down after the victory. The workers who followed the factories inland were assisted by organizations such as the Good Relief General Office and the Labor Association, and after overcoming many difficulties, were repatriated to Shanghai. Up to now, two to three thousand people have arrived successively, of which more than a thousand people have been taken in by the Good Relief General Office at the Compatriot Reception Center. Because of their contribution to war production, they demanded priority in re-employment after arriving in Shanghai. However, due to the large number of unemployed in the city, relevant authorities made various efforts, but only more than 140 people were able to find work. The picture shows a group of petitioning workers (photographed by Yu Chuangshuo).</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a thousand unemployed workers from the rear gathered on the Bund, lined up, and holding flags, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Representatives were sent in to negotiate with Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Department. A portion of the workers waiting outside also wanted to enter, but were stopped by the police guarding the door, resulting in a conflict. The workers, emotionally agitated, smashed the windows of the Labor Department and other items, seized several police firearms, and injured five police officers, causing great chaos in the Social Affairs Bureau. After hearing the news, the police bureau dispatched a large number of fully armed police officers to the scene to suppress the riot. The mounted patrol team also rushed to the scene, and machine guns were set up in front of the Social Affairs Bureau, with hundreds of police officers deployed for guard, making the situation very tense. The injured police officers were sent to the police hospital by ambulance. The seized firearms were all recovered after much persuasion. However, the workers refused to leave, and a stalemate ensued for a long time. Director Wu Xuan, who was attending a municipal meeting at the time, rushed to the scene after hearing the news. He summoned the representatives of the workers to admonish them separately, pointing out that their actions of attacking the police and seizing firearms were inappropriate. The worker representatives also took the blame and issued a letter of repentance, acknowledging that they would hand over the perpetrators. Then, Zhu Xuefan of the Labor Association and Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Department, came out to address all the workers. Mr. Zhu first stated: When you initially came from Chongqing, the Labor Association was responsible for participating in the matter. After arriving in Shanghai, you still had no work and have been wandering until today, leading to this incident. I, Zhu Xuefan, am sorry to everyone. However, today's matter should be discussed in two parts: one is the issue of demanding re-employment and relief, and the other is the issue of overstepping boundaries. Regarding the issue of re-employment and relief, (1) the Gongda Yarn Factory guarantees to be completed within two weeks as a centralized reception center, (2) starting tomorrow, each person will be given a bag of relief flour, and those with families will be calculated according to the roster, (3) relief will continue until the employment problem is resolved, and a request will be made to the government to appropriately issue pocket money, (4) a mechanism for handling labor disputes will be established to be responsible for resolving the re-employment problem, (5) it is proposed to establish cooperative factories, with the government providing machinery and capital, and unemployed workers participating in work with slightly lower wages, with the surplus used as the factory's fund, and labor participating in management. Regarding the issue of exceeding boundaries, Mr. Zhu stated that he was sorry to the government in public and to Director Wu in private. Now that things have come to this, he hoped that they would acknowledge their mistakes and apologize. He and Director Zhao Banfu would negotiate. He would take responsibility for today's events, hoping that everyone would listen and return. Then, Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Department, addressed the workers, stating that everyone knew whether he had been speaking for the workers since the Interim Council. And the Gongda Yarn Factory was also something he had negotiated and fought for for three days. Today, he had nothing else to say, only two sentences: first, please go back, and second, the future matters will be the responsibility of Comrade Zhu Xuefan and himself to resolve. Both Zhu and Zhao were moved to tears when advising the workers. The unemployed workers were mostly moved and followed the advice, lining up and withdrawing, shouting slogans in front of the Municipal Government on their way back to the Bund before dispersing. However, the issue of re-employment still awaits consultation and resolution by various directors and relevant authorities.</p>

<h3>Yuan Ludeng Sentenced to a Long Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yuan Ludeng, one of the [Three Elders] of Shanghai, has been sentenced to life imprisonment after Tang Shoumin. When Yuan was brought to court at around 9:00 yesterday morning, he was still wearing a gray gown and black shoes, looking listless. Because of his hearing impairment, he had to cover his ear with his right hand to hear the court clerk read the sentence. His face turned ashen, and he nodded slightly. Judge Zhai politely said that he could request a retrial. When leaving the court, Yuan muttered to himself, asking God to know his sins, and his eyes were slightly red. His family members and children, about eight or nine people, were listening and cried to Yuan incessantly, and prayed to God together, while Yuan reluctantly comforted them, saying, "It's okay." (The picture shows the family members following and comforting him as he was being escorted back, and Yuan forcing a smile.)</p>
<h3>Yuan Ludeng Sentenced to a Long Imprisonment, Family Members Wept Upon Hearing the Sentence, Praying to God Together</h3>

<h3>Six More People Indicted</h3>
<p>In addition, the High Prosecutor's Office has completed the investigation of a batch of traitors, including Gao Xiaoguang, Lü Xiangquan, Yang Xianzheng, Feng Jie, Liu Ganhong, and Cheng Xuanqing, and has filed public prosecutions. As for the cases of Pi Shaozhang and Zhou Buguang, there was insufficient suspicion, and no prosecution was filed.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Yuan Ludeng Case</h3>
<p>Facts: Yuan Ludeng was the manager of the Ning Shao Shipping Company and had served as a Chinese Director of the former Shanghai International Settlement Board of Directors for many years. After the fall of Shanghai, Yuan Ludeng continued to serve as a pseudo-director and chairman of the Shanghai Pseudo-Municipal Chamber of Commerce. In September 1943, the Pseudo-Nanjing Government Executive Yuan, in conjunction with the enemy, organized the Rice and Grain Control Association, with Yuan Ludeng serving as the chairman and a member of the Pseudo-Nanjing Materials Control Review Committee, purchasing rice and grain for the enemy to supply military needs, until he resigned at the end of June 1944. In February 1942, the International Settlement, due to explosions by our patriots, was uneasy. The central area of the Settlement was divided into six districts and blockaded. The defendant, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, organized Baojia, served as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee in February, handed it over to the Pseudo-Police Department, checked household registrations, hoping to eliminate our patriotic elements, and also served as a member of the Pseudo-New National Sports Association. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was detained by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: The defendant, Yuan Ludeng, has confessed without reservation to the various positions he held in the pseudo-government. This is consistent with the confession he made to the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, and there are contemporary newspapers that can prove it, which shows that his confession is consistent with the facts. Although he argued in this court that the Pseudo-Materials Control Review Committee and the Pseudo-New National Sports Association were both in Nanjing, and although there were pseudo-orders, he did not attend, etc., except for the Pseudo-New National Sports Association, there is no active evidence to prove that the defendant attended. Regarding the Pseudo-Materials Control Review Committee, the defendant did attend, as evidenced by the Shanghai "Shen Bao" of November 3, 1943, which cannot be refuted by empty words. According to the testimony, the chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Association was a natural member of the Materials Control Review Committee. Therefore, the records of this newspaper are especially worthy of reference. What should be investigated now is whether the defendant colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against the country, and other crimes. The Rice and Grain Control Association was an organization jointly formed by the Pseudo-National Government and the enemy Japan. In name, it was subordinate to the Pseudo-Executive Yuan, but it had five Japanese members and five or six Chinese members, two deputy chairmen, one being Chen Guoquan and the other being Japanese Ueda Kenjiro, as repeatedly testified by the defendant and supported by the fifth piece of evidence submitted by the defense counsel (Commercial Control Regulations), which clearly stated that it was an organization jointly formed by China and Japan. In this enemy-puppet joint organization, serving as the chairman is sufficient to establish the crime of colluding with the enemy. Moreover, judging from the defendant's usual statements, one said, "At the moment when the protection of the Greater East Asia War is being actively launched, sufficient food and soldiers are important conditions for establishing and protecting the country, and it has a very close relationship with the survival and honor of the Greater East Asia's future. This association bears the entrustment of the 'Central Government' and the hope of the national masses." (See "New China Daily" on October 20, 1943) Another said, "Now fortunately relying on the Allied countries to preside over the justice of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, I cannot help but admire them. Our country's supply of materials, especially the continuous supply of main food, is really our inescapable responsibility." (See "New China Daily" on January 10, 1944) A third said, "China has joined the war and is fighting on the same front with the Allied countries to defeat Britain and the United States." (See "Shen Bao" on March 31, 1945) A fourth said, "I am willing to continue to work hard, so that we can move towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War." (See "New China Daily" on June 5, 1945), etc. and the second piece of evidence submitted by the counsel (Commercial Control Association Publication), which contains the rice distribution situation of the Rice Control Association for China and Japan, viewed in conjunction with each other, proves beyond doubt that he colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against the country, purchasing rice and grain to supply the enemy's military needs. Although it was argued that the speeches published in the newspaper were not his original intention, and the defense counsel even claimed that they were revised and proposed by Chen Binhe as proof in the twenty-second piece of evidence, it was found that this piece of evidence was published in November 1945, many days after the defendant was arrested, and was written by a private person after the fact, and was not the defendant's statement after seeing the newspaper that year, so it cannot be adopted. Moreover, the defendant's speech contains the phrase "especially the continuous supply of main food, which is an inescapable responsibility." It is consistent with the rice and grain control distribution in the second piece of evidence, which targets the military rice of China and Japan, and cannot be denied by empty words. Although it was also argued that the purpose of my taking office as the chairman of the Rice Control Association was twofold: (1) to increase the price of rice from 200 yuan per stone to 820 yuan. (2) to supply household rice, and to resign immediately if the household rice was not available, both of which were beneficial to the people. It is not known that the enemy's direct purchase of rice, paying a low price of 200 yuan per stone, would inevitably arouse the anger of the people and lead to common resistance, making it easier for materials to escape, and the result would ultimately be failure. Therefore, there was a mixed organization of the Rice Control Association, which changed the enemy's previous direct requisition to indirect requisition, acting as an accomplice of the tiger, and the circumstances were obvious. According to Article 2, paragraph 1, item 5 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, the evidence of his colluding with the enemy to purchase grain is conclusive. As for increasing the price of rice, it not only helped the enemy and puppets win over the people but also facilitated centralized procurement, both of which were acts that benefited the enemy and puppets and harmed the country, which was sufficient to increase his guilt. In addition, the provision of household rice was not only limited in quantity, but also almost "cut off." The defendant's statement was clear, showing that his procurement of grain was mainly for military rice and that he placed the people's household rice in an insignificant position, which was more obvious and left no room for denying responsibility. The defendant's organization of Baojia due to the explosions in the settlement by our patriots and the enemy's unrest was also confessed without reservation. Anyone who, during the War of Resistance, considered stabilizing order for the enemy and puppets was an act that benefited the enemy and puppets, which is self-evident. Moreover, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets to serve as the chairman of the preparatory committee, according to the provisions of Article 3 of the same regulations, cannot absolve him of the crime of plotting resistance against the country. In summary, the defendant's actions before and after not only constitute a crime under Article 2, paragraph 1, item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, but also violate the provisions of item 5 and Article 3 of the same article, which is based on a single act of colluding with the enemy. Although he has committed several crimes, he should be punished for one of the most serious crimes. As for the claim of his counsel that the defendant resigned in May 1944 and submitted a certificate from Hongqiao Sanatorium, claiming that the crime was committed before June 1, 1944, which is in line with the method of commutation, it is inconsistent with the defendant's confession in the Military Intelligence Bureau, which stated, "By the time of May, there was no way, so I decided to resign, and only achieved the goal by the end of June." This shows that the defendant's departure from the relationship of the Rice Control Association was indeed after June. Even if there was a fact of being admitted to the hospital for recuperation, it is not enough to prove that the responsibility has been resolved, so it cannot be used as a reason for commutation. The defendant colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against the country, purchasing grain to supply military needs, and the circumstances are indeed serious. He should have been sentenced to the death penalty to show a warning. However, before committing the crime, he had rescued refugees, and his usual conduct was not bad, so he was temporarily spared from death and sentenced to life imprisonment under Chinese law. All property should be confiscated according to law. Based on the above conclusions, it should be based on Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, item 1 of paragraph 1 of Article 2, item 5, Article 3, Article 8, paragraph 1, Article 9, Article 1, Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 55, and Article 37, paragraph 1, and the judgment is made as in the main text.</p>
<p>This case was executed by Prosecutor Xia Luli attending court, May 31, 1946, Shanghai High Court Criminal Court Presiding Judge Xiao Xie, Judge Yang Ding, Judge Feng Zhidong.</p>
<h3>Seven Traitors Interrogated, One is a Woman Whose Husband is an Interpreter</h3>

<h3>Military Tribunal Opens Trial of the Case of the Village Chief Who Died Tragically Rescuing an American Pilot; Seven Criminals Including the Japanese Military Police Squad Leader Rely on Denials; Deny Participating in the Murder of Monk Xue</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the victory, the family members of Xue Heshang, the village chief of Sanlintang Binpu Township in Pudong, who tragically died from injuries sustained after being tortured by the former Pudong Military Police Squad for rescuing an American pilot, reported the case to the Third War Zone Prisoner of War Management Office. On February 9th of this year, a total of seven criminals in the case were arrested and transferred to the local Military Tribunal. After investigation, Prosecutor Gu Yongquan found the facts to be true and filed a public prosecution. The first trial was held at 10:00 yesterday morning. Due to the complexity of the case, it was temporarily changed to an investigation court, presided over by Military Judge Jiang Baolian. The first defendant, Kuboe Yasuharu, testified that before the surrender, he was the squad leader of the Special Higher Division of the Pudong Military Police Squad. In January 1945, an American pilot landed in Pudong, and the Shanghai Military Police ordered him to investigate. Later, the detachment leader Ono received an anonymous letter and learned that Xue Heshang had let him go, so he sent Hirata Kiyokazu to arrest Xue. He was released the first time because he had no confession, but at the weekly meeting of the Shanghai Military Police, it was deemed necessary to investigate Xue Heshang again, so he was arrested again and held in prison for three or four days before he died. He denied participating in the confession. The other witnesses Gunji Katayama, Corporal Omori Mitsuru, Sergeant Noma Sadaji, Private First Class Morishita Muneyuki, Sergeant Major Sasaya Tsutato, and Sergeant Hayahara Isao testified in a similar manner, denying participating in the murder. At 12:30, the court announced that it would summon witnesses to court at 2:00 pm and then conduct another hearing. At that time, the victim's family members, Xue Quangen, etc., came to court and recounted the detailed situation at the time, until 5:30 pm. The court announced that the trial would be reopened at a later date.</p>
<h3>Xu Jiqing Talks About Grain Loans; Verification of Grain Merchant Accounts Will Be Announced Soon; If There is Any Embezzlement, It Will Be Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>The Grain Department's grain merchant loan program in this city, after its implementation, coincided with fluctuations in grain prices, which has aroused speculation from all sides. According to Speaker Xu Jiqing: This 100 million yuan loan is a trial program, and the generation of borrowers is purely based on recommendation methods. The total amount of grain transported by the loan merchants is about 35,000 shi or more. The purpose of the grain loan was originally to support the grain merchants' transportation capacity, in order to dredge the grain source in this city, but the result was the evil phenomenon of the rice market disturbance on April 29, so it was decided to end the trial period. Regarding the application of the loan, there are extremely detailed regulations in the grain loan method. It is heard that in addition to the Grain Administration Office sending personnel to investigate households based on the sales report, the audit committee also commissioned a credible accounting firm to be responsible for verifying the accounts of each grain merchant. It will soon be announced whether the loan merchants comply with the loan methods. As for the profits obtained by the loan merchants due to the opportunity of the sudden rise in rice prices, the audit committee will decide on the disposal methods after the account verification is completed. If the grain merchants fail to follow the regulations and embezzle, they should be punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Opening of Campaign Lawsuit Case: Xia Gongkai and Others Sue the City Government for Illegal Malpractice; The Court Orders the Plaintiffs Have No Right to Investigate Administrative Measures; Zhang Xiaosong Should Be Summoned to Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the first city councilor election lawsuit in this city opened at the District Court. The plaintiffs, lawyers Xia Gongkai and four others, Yan Cai Ding, Lu Chaohai, and Fang Zhong, were present in court. The defendants were represented by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the People's Administration Office, and Li Xuexun, Chief of the Third Section of the same office, as the legal representatives of the Municipal Government, represented by lawyers Zhang Shijian, Qin Liankui, and Chen Dingming as litigation agents for defense. After the court session began, Xia stated first: "There were four illegal aspects in this election: (1) candidates did not complete registration and public announcement; (2) all voters did not complete registration and public announcement; (3) originally, district people's representatives should have supervised the ballot counting, but in fact, there were no district people's representatives at all, and they were appointed or hired by the Municipal Government; (4) voters were elected in different districts. As for the matter of malpractice, there are Jiang Tianbai in the 16th district and Cen Zhiyuan in the 5th district who can list specific facts, requesting the court to summon them at the next hearing." Subsequently, Zhang Xiaosong and Li Xuexun gave statements of facts. Finally, Xia Gongkai pointed out that the defendants' answers were inaccurate, and he and Director Zhang argued with each other. Judge Xu then declared: The plaintiffs have no right to investigate the various administrative measures of the Municipal Government one by one. At 10:40 AM, the court adjourned and rescheduled for another hearing.</p>

<p>Also, in another election lawsuit, namely the case of Cao Shengzhi, a candidate in the 8th district, suing the district office for improperly handling spoiled ballots, the plaintiff retained lawyer Huang Renda as the litigation agent, and the plaintiff himself did not appear in court. The defendant was still represented by Li Xuexun. According to Huang Renda: The plaintiff received 1,648 votes, and could have been ranked as the third alternate, but more than thirty votes were invalidated due to illegible handwriting, resulting in him being ranked fourth and unable to be elected. Then Chief Li presented 404 ballots, which were inspected on the spot. The spoiled ballots only numbered fifteen. Huang Renda then requested that the person in charge of the district be summoned. The court ordered a re-hearing next Monday at 10:00 AM.</p>

<h3>Guangxi University Relocates to Guilin for Re-establishment; President Chen Jianxiao Comes to Nanjing to Report on His Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] Chen Jianxiao, President of National Guangxi University, recently traveled from Liujiang via Chongqing to Nanjing to report to the Ministry of Education. It is understood that Guangxi University, established in 1928, was painstakingly managed by the late President Ma Junwu, with a roughly established scale and well-equipped facilities, especially in colleges such as science, engineering, agriculture, etc., which can be called the most complete university in the southwest. However, in 1944, it encountered the "Hunan-Guangxi" and "Hunan-Guizhou" wars and was relocated to Rongjiang, Guizhou, suffering heavy losses. Last year, due to the narrowness of the temporary campus in Liuzhou, there was a so-called "return to Wuzhou" movement, forming a trend, which was unfortunate. After the Ministry of Education submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, the school should still be relocated back to Guilin for resumption of classes, and Mr. Chen was appointed as the president, which was generally welcomed and stabilized the situation. Mr. Chen told reporters: (1) Guangxi University has always been known for its pure and studious atmosphere. The previous "return to Wuzhou" movement was not too bad in order, and the reports that students carried hand-held grenades, coerced the school, issued more than 10 million legal tender, beat student Li Xiulong to death and robbed public property, and went to Wuzhou, etc., were all fabrications. After repeated investigation by the author, it can be responsibly stated. (2) The school is now scheduled to resume classes in Guilin in early June, without a summer vacation, to make up for the second semester of the last academic year. (3) More than half of the original Liangfeng campus was destroyed. Although it was widely repaired, it was still not enough. The Ministry of Education and the Resources Committee were requested to allocate the former Radio Engineering Equipment Factory of the Guilin General Bridge as the campus. After several consultations, Director Qian of the Resources Committee agreed to lease it. (4) There is a great shortage of professors in departments such as Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Economics, Accounting and Banking, and Chemical Engineering. In addition to appointing a part in Chongqing, it is still necessary to recruit from all aspects. (5) The loss of books and instruments is extremely large, and it is planned to investigate and purchase some to supplement them. (6) Plans for funding and summer make-up classes, and enrollment for the next academic year are being requested from the Ministry of Education. Mr. Chen has been away from the school for three weeks, and will fly to Guilin in the next few days, preparing to do his best to develop Guangxi University to restore its former appearance. (Yu)</p>
<h3>International PEN</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Sweden Tomorrow</p>
<p>Hu Shi Elected to the Presidium</p>
<p>[British News Agency London 31st] Prominent figures in the British literary world will be invited to attend the 18th Congress of the International PEN, which is scheduled to be held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, on June 2.</p>
<p>PEN was established in England in 1921, with John Galsworthy as the first president, dedicated to close cooperation among writers around the world.

<h3>National Frontier School Prepares to Return East from Chongqing; Wuxi Meiyuan Determined as Campus</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenwang Special News] The National Frontier School was originally affiliated to the Central Political School in the capital before the war. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, it moved west to Chongqing with the Central Political School. The Ministry of Education then appointed Wang Shenhe as the principal and separated from the political school to become the only national institution in China that implements frontier education. Now, it is preparing to return east. Because it is not easy to find houses in the capital, Wuxi Meiyuan was specially designated as the campus. The school has now begun to move east from Chongqing, and will pass through Baoji, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, and Nanjing. It will arrive in Wuxi at the end of this month to prepare for the resumption of classes. ( )</p>

On the other hand, the supply from the China Textile Corporation is not as abundant, so the market sentiment is firm. The Wuxi Qingfeng Yarn Factory opened at 52,000 yuan for dozens of pieces of 12-pound "Double Fish Jiqing" fine cloth, further boosting confidence.

<h3>Sichuan Sugar Industry Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai; Two Sugar Factories Relocated from Taiwan to Sichuan; Demonstration Sugar Factories Established in Zizhong and Neijiang</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Province Sugar Industry Inspection Group recently arrived in Shanghai via Chongqing and Beijing. The head of the group, Chen Rangqing, flew to Taiwan a few days ago. Inspection specialists Li An and Li Limin will also go to Taiwan for inspection. According to Mr. Li, since the introduction of Indian sugarcane varieties, the sugarcane production in the Zizhong and Neijiang areas of Sichuan Province has gradually increased, and the quality has also improved. However, due to outdated refining methods, the production volume is not high, and the production cost is also high. The current pressing equipment can only extract 50-60% of the sugar content from the sugarcane. The remaining 40-50% is discarded in the bagasse. This bagasse is not even enough for fuel to boil the sugar, falling short of the fuel needed from the hills by two-thirds. The annual sugar production in Sichuan is about 500,000 tons. During the war, Sichuan Province lacked gasoline, so molasses was used to refine alcohol as a substitute for gasoline. Now, in order to build a new Sichuan and improve agricultural and industrial production and technology, the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Sichuan sugar industry, in order to improve Sichuan sugar production, Chen and others visited the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yiwu, and the Chairman of the Resources Committee, Qian Changzhao, and the heads of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office and Taiwan Sugar Corporation in Beijing to discuss improving Sichuan sugar. The Ministry and the Resources Committee also agreed that Sichuan sugar needed improvement. It was also agreed with the Taiwan authorities to relocate two medium-sized sugar factories from the province to Zizhong and Neijiang in Sichuan as a demonstration of sugar production. These two factories are enemy and puppet industries that were taken over, one with a capacity of 500 tons and the other with 300 tons (sugarcane crushing capacity). The Resources Committee will also invest in this machinery at a price, and in the future, in addition to the appropriation from the Sichuan Construction Department, the factory construction and operating funds for the two factories will be raised by sugarcane farmers and the sugar industry to jointly establish a government-business sugar factory. The sugar making machine is very suitable for the needs of Sichuan Province, and the efficiency of the machine is also higher than the old one. It can extract 97-98% of the sugar content from the cane, and the bagasse can also be used for boiling sugar and is more than enough. Therefore, this trip has been helped by the central government, and a detailed investigation and research will be conducted in Taiwan, and experts in sugar-making and sugarcane planting from Taiwan will be invited to Sichuan to jointly improve the process. They also intend to receive the machinery of the two factories for shipping to Sichuan after the inspection. If transportation is convenient, this machine can be used in Sichuan this winter. It is reported that the Sichuan sugar industry has recently launched a large-scale machine sugar factory.</p>

<h3>Introducing a Tool for Learning English</h3>
<p>— Tong Fang</p>
<p>The most difficult part of learning any language is not grammar or rhetoric, but the active use of everyday words and idioms, and various special idiomatic usages. To thoroughly understand the active use of words and idioms and special idiomatic usages, one must pay special attention and careful observation when reading or writing.</p>
<p>A language has its own special structure and its own special usages. Unless you have a good foundation in this, you will never master that language. Chinese students often take many detours when learning English because they lack good tools for learning English, especially tools that specifically instruct on usage.</p>
<p>The "Dictionary of English Usage," newly published by Jingwen Bookstore, can make up for this shortcoming. The author, Ge Chuanzhen, is a self-taught English scholar and professor at Datong University. This book provides a very detailed analysis of the active use of words and idioms and special idiomatic usages in English and American languages. It provides many examples and specifically points out the places where Chinese people are most likely to make mistakes or misunderstandings. It is indeed a very practical tool for Chinese students. I remember that Dr. Lin Yutang published an article on how to learn English in the "Middle School Student" magazine during the war, which also mentioned the problem of idiomatic usages. However, few people have been willing to spend a lot of effort to compile a dictionary of idiomatic usages, so Mr. Ge's book is very worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>According to the author in the preface, the completion of this dictionary took nearly ten years, which shows the author's dedication. The book uses simple Chinese and clear examples to explain the correct usage of all common words, idioms, and structures in English, paying special attention to what Chinese students are prone to misuse, misunderstand, or various other problems. As the author said: "It is a unique English usage dictionary made by Chinese people for Chinese people. I say made by Chinese people for Chinese people - yes, I am Chinese, and those who use this dictionary are also Chinese. Only Chinese people (not necessarily me) can make this book or a similar book; and only Chinese people need this kind of book." From this, we can see how suitable it is for Chinese people's needs.</p>
<p>In addition to referring to several dictionaries and grammar books, the author also referred to many literary and non-literary books. He extracted and compared them at any time from these many books. The biggest advantage is that it is not limited by the rules of grammarians and rhetoricians, and indeed there are some places where the author's own unique insights are developed.</p>
<p>I am convinced that people who are learning English will be able to get a lot of help from this unique "Dictionary of English Usage."</p>
<h3>An Introduction to "A History of Western Philosophy" by Wu Fang</h3>
<p>This book is based on A. Weber's "History of Philosophy" and incorporates the essence of other books, but it also contains the author's own unique opinions. In terms of historical narration, the chronology is based on the Common Era, and events related to the entire Chinese culture are accompanied by the Chinese chronology to facilitate comparison with the evolution of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>In terms of content, the author focuses on major events in the history of philosophy, detailing the past and neglecting the present. Modern philosophy is narrated up to Hegel. The author has his own intentions in this regard. He believes that new philosophical systems have not been established since Hegel. Although many philosophers have hoped to establish their own philosophical systems, they have not succeeded in fact. Their thoughts are at most a continuation of the philosophies of Kant and Hegel. At the same time, the author feels that the modern era is closer to us and easier to grasp, while the ancient philosophical thoughts are too far away from the present, so a detailed narration may help readers to have a deeper understanding of the distant ancient philosophical thoughts.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into three parts to describe Greek philosophy, medieval philosophy, and modern philosophy, in addition to the "Introduction". From here, we can see what kind of spiritual life the people of Greece, the cradle of Western philosophy, once lived, how Greek philosophy continued to develop in the Middle Ages, and then make us realize the origin and characteristics of modern human spiritual life, how the methodology of science was established, and the current state of philosophical development.</p>
<p>I feel that the difference between this "A History of Western Philosophy" and other similar books is that the author's motivation for writing is to meet the needs of modern people. He believes that today's China should strive to "complete modernization". Modernization, to put it bluntly, is Westernization—"the entire cultural level created by modern Western science, technology, thought, and spirit, thereby running through everything in today's most advanced social organizations, political institutions, and lifestyles." Indeed, the fruits of modern Western culture were slowly cultivated from ancient philosophical thoughts. We must trace back to the source. This is the main reason why we must study the development of Western philosophical thoughts. It can also be said that the author wrote this book in order to meet the practical needs of the present.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest advantage of this book is that it is written from the perspective of Chinese people. We can see the personality revealed by the author - the personality of a Chinese person. In order to make this book more popular, the author often remembers the words in the "Cheng Shi Yi Shu": "When establishing words, you want to contain meaning, so that those who know virtue will not be suppressed, and those who have no virtue will not be confused." It can be seen that the author has savored his words and hopes to be as popular as possible. The book ends with thirteen annotated entries on Western philosophy entry books, which are of great reference value.</p>
<h3>Reading "The System and Criticism of Chinese Painting Theory"</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Written by Li Changzhi</p>
<p>Printed and published by the Independent Publishing House</p>
<p>A work that comprehensively studies Chinese painting theory and establishes a system is rarely seen in the domestic publishing industry. Ten years ago, Liu Haisu wrote "On the Six Laws of Chinese Painting" (Zhonghua edition), in which he pointed out the core and development of the theory of "Six Laws" in order to understand Chinese painting. It is a masterpiece after scientific organization. According to the two methods of handling academic materials defined by Werner Mahrhilz, it belongs to the historical, as for the systematic-philosophical treatment of Chinese painting theory to understand Chinese painting, in the impoverished Chinese academic world, such a thin "The System and Criticism of Chinese Painting Theory" can be said to be the only one.</p>
<p>The author handles the entire Chinese painting with an attitude of opposing "only can be comprehended, cannot be expressed," and he advocates the use of modern language to express it, which is very valuable.</p>
<p>The book's argument focuses on the art of the Song and Yuan dynasties, because the author confirms that Chinese painting reached its peak with the people of the Song and Yuan dynasties.</p>
<p>The entire book raises the following four questions as a concrete method for comprehensively understanding Chinese painting.</p>
<p>(1) The subjective problem of Chinese painting.</p>
<p>(2) The object problem of Chinese painting.</p>
<p>(3) The utensil problem of Chinese painting.</p>
<p>(4) The general art problem of Chinese painting.</p>
<p>Applying Kant's aesthetic theories: "The sublime must always be great, but the beautiful can be small. The sublime must be simple and clean, but the beautiful can be embellished and adorned." and "Older people have more sublimity, while younger people have more beauty." and Winkelmann: "From simplicity and unity, all beauty turns into sublimity." and other aesthetic theories, to conclude that Chinese painting is sublime and masculine. Although this statement is not entirely correct, it cannot be denied that it is the author's unique point of view.</p>
<p>In the "Conclusion," the author further affirms: "Chinese painting has great value and permanent value, but at the same time I feel that it has no future and has already passed." This is also quite correct.</p>
<p>However, the social reasons for the occurrence and development of Chinese painting, and the social reasons that constitute "sublime", "masculine", "great value", "permanent value", "no future", and "already passed" have not been examined. Therefore, the author can only abstractly use an aesthetic concept to compare and make judgments, which must be admitted as a shortcoming of the book.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Police Books Written by Zheng</h3>
<p>— Yang Guozhen</p>
<p>There used to be two good sayings: "You hate to read too little when you need to, and you don't know the difficulty until you experience it." Police books have not been paid attention to by ordinary police officers for a long time before the victory: after the victory, it seems that it should not be the era of incompetent officials, and most police officers want to reform everything, so they are eager to search for police books everywhere, especially the books of Mr. Zheng Zongkai, a famous figure in the police world, are not easy to buy. Good books are only starting to feel important now, when will good people start to feel valuable? I searched for more than half a year, and finally found several Zheng's books from friends in the police world in Beijing and Shanghai, and now I will introduce them to inform friends in the police world across the country.</p>
<p>(1) General Theory of Police Law (First Edition and Revised Edition) - This was written by Mr. Zheng Zongkai when he was teaching at the Central Police Academy before the war. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, it was sent to the Commercial Press for printing in Hong Kong, and the content is not as rich as the revised edition. The revised edition was completed when he was the chief of staff of the Chongqing Municipal Police Bureau during the war. He used fresh and lively experience to revise and modify it, and the opinions and comments in it are worthy of readers' reference. The attached "Outline for Administrative Reform during and after the War" is not limited to the police industry, and has guiding value for the entire administrative system of our country in the future; unfortunately, he put this thing in the general theory of police, and it is not easy for big people to see it. The book is not currently distributed in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, and must be purchased from the Commercial Press on Baixiang Street, Chongqing.</p>
<p>(2) Theory and Practice of Modern Police - This was published by Zhengzhong Bookstore when Mr. Zheng was in Chongqing during the Chongqing bombing. The content is extensive and quite substantial; it is a pity that some of it is outdated and impractical. These things, after a long time, I am afraid that they will not be welcomed by readers, but most of the things can still be used by readers for further study, which is not a completely practical book.</p>
<p>(3) On Police Patrol Duty - Also the Chongqing edition of Zhengzhong Bookstore, all of which are lecture notes taken by university students. The book is helpful for the reform of police sub-bureaus' external affairs; however, most of it is taken from the United Kingdom and the United States, and it does not mention whether China should implement "police control areas." The speech is very interesting, and the speaker is indeed knowledgeable, and is by no means empty talk. The book is quite beneficial to the staff of the Supervision Office of the Police Headquarters and the staff of each sub-bureau.</p>
<p>(4) Introduction to Police Mobilization - This book has a large version, but the number of pages is small, which is its shortcoming. Zheng Guangsheng rushed to write this manuscript and sent it to the Commercial Press in Shanghai for publication when the July 7th Incident occurred, and then moved west with the government. Although there is nothing to recommend in the book, it is still a relatively novel one in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>(5) Police Officer's Case Handling Manual - This book was published by Zhengzhong Bookstore in Chongqing. There is a preface by Zhao Chen, the current President of the Capital Higher Court, at the beginning of the volume,</p>
<p>In which it is said: "My friend Zheng Zongkai asked me to write a preface for his new book Police Officer's Case Handling Manual. After I read it, although there are only tens of thousands of words, the content is very broad. It covers all aspects of criminal law, criminal procedure law, penology, criminology, criminal policy, forensic medicine trial, psychology, detective science, fingerprinting, and criminal investigation methods and other criminal law knowledge, all of which are outlined and summarized. Mr. Zheng is not only an authority on police science, but also worthy of being an expert in criminal law. ... "Because case handling requires it, it is naturally welcomed by ordinary police officers. The advantage of the book is that it can enable readers to learn the systematic knowledge of handling illegal police and investigating criminal cases. According to people in the police circle, many police books are not written by the authors themselves, but are written by others on their behalf; the books written by Zheng Zongkai are definitely written by himself.</p>
