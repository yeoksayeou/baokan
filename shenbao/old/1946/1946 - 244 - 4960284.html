<h3>從戰身上搜獲　中共秘密文件　指示土地革命與作戰方略</h3>
<p>〔　中央社北平二十九日電〕最近國軍在某地共軍俘　身上，搜獲重要秘密文件一件，爲中共中央決議，指示今後士地革命與全而作戰方略，至爲明晰，全文如下：</p>
<p>中共中央最近規定解放區，目前工作大網，以適應正在開始的國內戰爭情勢。</p>
<p>（一）鞏固解放區問題</p>
<p>（一）爲使解放區要能鞏固的向前發展，土地革命，要能深入的擴大八路軍新四軍，要能有好的團結，堅固的組織與政治的堅定，允其是開始革命戰爭，要能有陣地進行大規模的作戰，要能擊破國民黨的進攻，各地零散的解放政權，要能集中起來，建立起來，一個全國解放政權，這就必須爭取左列三項最主要的條件：</p>
<p>（一）完成農民羣衆發動的充分程度。</p>
<p>（二）勵行後備武裝正規戰的訓練。</p>
<p>（三）進而取得點綫上有戰略形勢的城市。</p>
<p>（二）依照上述的條件，中共中央現確定晋冀察，聯接到豫魯蘇北爲一大區城，要鞏固他，發展他成爲解放區的中央根據地，我們要用大的力量快的速度，將他鞏固的建立起來。</p>
<p>（三）鞏固解放區根據地的一般條件，是首先要發動農村基本羣衆，貧農，雇農，苦力，逐漸得到土地革命的利益，並鞏固對中農聯系，堅決的反對和抑制富農的發展，在道裏最重要的策略，是根據以人口勞動力爲標準的澈底重分土地的辦法，嚴禁以生產工具爲標準的富農擴張土地辦法，要最謹愼的不要侵書到中農利益，現在解放區中，仍然存在着富農路綫的障礙，藉均分土地的機會，把持土地革命的利益，另一方又有不少區域，走到大殺富農，動搖中農的錯誤策略上去，這都是障　鞏固解放區最主要的危險。第一，要堅決的迅速的肅淸解放區一切反動勢力的組織，及其武裝。要排斥富農成分於政權，及一切武裝組織之外，要吸引土匪流氓　衆，他來得到土地革命的利益，最好的辦法，是解散他們固有的組織，分配給他們以相常土地，解決他們的反動領袖、就是同情革命的領袖，也不能讓他率領原來的羣衆。第二，要建立起眞正廣大工農勞動羣衆，自己管理的解放區政權，已經建立了解放區政權的地方，要動員羣衆實行改選，在政權由最主要的是樹立起堅强的無產階級的領導，堅決的執行邊區政府所頒佈的一切法令，第三，要在八路軍新四軍中建立純工參成分的「鐵軍」同時又必須加强後備軍的訓練，在這裏集中與統一的軍事指揮便成爲先決間題，第四，在實行鞏固解放區任務，必須要反對「偏安割據」「和平保守」「躱避上山」等觀念，必須要反對「割疆自守」不向外發展的自殺政策，尤其是要反對「兜圈子式」「遊擊式」的發展。</p>
<p>（四）在鞏固解放區的義意上，解放區內一切城市應完全佔領，當然在戰術上，允其是在發動　衆上，一些較大的城市，不是都可以一下子佔領的，但亦決不容許國民黨，在晋冀察豫魯解放區內，一些重要城市中繼續統治，以及指揮反動武力向解放區進攻，舉例如平綏路的綏包大同，平漢綫的平保石，津浦綫滄濟泰徐，北寗綫的唐榆，其所以能在國民黨手中長期佔據的主要原因，便因整個交通幹綫未爲我們切斷，故國民黨得以輸送兵械長驅直入，這樣使解放區內部，時時有被他們騷擾的危險，我們外出作戰，遂也無後防可言·不過佔領與鞏固解放區內部的一切城市，也決不是單據硬攻孤守這一城市所能收效，相反的，佔領這一城市，如果是要靠發動廣大的四週農民　衆來圍困他，是要靠加緊城內工作來響應他，則鞏固這一城市，更加要靠推廣四週羣衆的發動，加緊城鄕　衆的自衛工作，而保衛民主政權的八路軍，新四軍，反更要向外發展，切　民黨的一切交通，威逼着他們，使他無法侵入解放區，只有這樣，解放區才能鞏固，總起來說：解放區內部，決不容國民黨系力量絲毫的的存在，即平，津，保，石，濟等，含有政治性的大城市，也不容許其繼續存在，我們必須堅決的有計劃的運用發動　衆的力量，與軍事行動配合起來，將解放區內德國民黨力量，全部擊潰，當然這不是說將永久保障國民黨力量再也不　入了，但這一鞏固是開始的國內革命戰爭，必須具有的前提。</p>
<p>（二）八路軍新四軍的戰略與戰術</p>
<p>（一）目前八路軍新四軍的作戰的戰略，必須依據全國的政治情勢和黨在解放區的政治方針，現在國民黨乘着停戰的機會，向着大規模內戰準備，因此遂能從華南調幾師兵力向解放區進攻，所以最近晋冀察豫魯五　的國民黨軍隊的加强，進攻八路軍新四軍，佈置的確有相當實現的可能，我們在這裏必須要認淸，爲擊破國民黨的進攻，爲要使解放區不受到他們的摧殘，還能鞏固的　前發展，我們只有從內外兩方堅決的迅速的進行保衛解放區計劃，黨在解放區外部應進行動員　衆，以保衛解放區、並破壞國民黨軍進攻的企圖，此處且不說而是解放區內部則必須澈底肅淸國民黨系一切武裝，必須發動起廣大　眾的自衛，使國民黨首先不敢派遣隊伍深入解放區，八路軍新四軍的作戰戰略，則必須採取進攻，以壓迫國民黨的　入，從這個觀點出發，我們首先應以進攻的陣勢，向着點綫上的城　進攻，威逼的國民黨軍，退到不妨碍解放區發展的地帶，這樣，解放區不但可以得到鞏固，並且可以向外發展，而且也只有這樣，解放區的鞏固，才能得保障、國民黨進攻的計劃，才能碰着大的失敗，這個便是應付目解國民黨進攻的總方針，但必須補充兩點：（下文轉入第二版）</p>
<h3>讓售民用剩餘物資　中美昨簽立合約　宋院長麥克布發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔　中央社本市訊〕行政院宋院長及美國國外物資淸理局長　國務院特別帮辦麥克布，昨日共同發表關於美國在西太平洋及在中國大批民用剩餘物資讓售於中國政府一般合約之簽立、此項讓售，作爲劃抵美國在中國積欠之國幣費用及等於五千五百萬美元價値之其他撥付款項。</p>
<h3>美以剩餘物資　抵在華用費</h3>
<p>此項剩餘物資，在美國政府方面之原來成本，爲五億美元，散布於中國，冲繩島·關島，薩班島及其他海島之流動物資及八千五百萬美元在中國境內之固定設備。此外，可作爲抵銷美國所欠之七千四百萬美元者，尙有一億三千萬美元之其他剩餘物資。又成本九千萬美元之較小船舶及成本二千萬美元之積存由國西部剩餘物資。</p>
<p>爲迅速完成此項物資之修整及裝運起見，雙方同意另設三千萬美元之準備金，專供租船，償付技術人員及購買零件之用，此準備金亦在美國積欠之國幣項下劃抵。美國政府積欠之起因，乃美國對日作戰時，美國車隊在山國之用費是也。</p>
<p>美國政府除前項積欠外，又因在中國設置使領館及應付其他國幣項下之開支，取得價値折合三千五百萬美元，復以促進中，美兩方教育及文化上之交換設施，中國方面準備支出國幣折合二千萬美元，均將在此次剩餘物資項下　抵。</p>
<h3>助我經濟復員　發展兩國貿易</h3>
<p>中國所取得之剩餘物資，極適合於經濟復員之用，所以對於抵抗通貨膨脹之進展，將有莫大之力量。因此種物資在市場上極爲需要，而其變賣將予國庫以鉅大之補助也，但此物資並不包括飛機，軍火，武器或任何未先改爲民用之軍用品。</p>
<p>在美國方面，由於此項合的之訂立，將更能迅速獲得太平洋區軍隊之復員及物資之淸理，而且中國市塲取得此項物資後，將益可增加其力量，以發展其中·美兩國間之貿易。</p>
<p>行政院物資供應局，將負責處理此項物資，並將委託記若干美國工程公司，協助全部處理事務，於銷售此項物資時，將儘量利用現有之商業途徑·至於美國在中國經營之行商，對於承銷此項物資，將有絕對均等之機會，凡有商標之物品，將於可能範圍內儘量交原經理人辦理，並使用一切慣常之銷售方法。</p>
<h3>搬運此項物資　廿二月內完成</h3>
<p>中國方面，將於廿二個月內，將此項物資搬運完畢。除財務方面之協助外，於搬運此項物資時，並將取得太平洋各根據地美國軍隊之極度合作，以完成此項任務。</p>
<p>中國將於最近期內，開始輸入此項剩餘物資，其重要部份，應可在本年年底以前輸運完畢。</p>

<h3>軍調部政府代表蔡文治重要談話中共實已全面動員作戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕軍事調處執行總部政府方面參謀長蔡文治將軍，上月廿八日，偕少校參謀魯炳麟，自平乘執行部專機飛抵本市，昨日下午四時，特假何應欽將軍寓邸，向本市記者團發表渠對時局之談話如下：　　對於目前時局，在八月十四日主席之文告，及中宣部彭部長歷次談話，均為調處部工作之準繩，本人不便另外有所發言，惟對於目前國內外一般輿論，及中共之宣傳戰所造成之迷惑局面，願有以澄清之：</p>
<p>（一）中共於八月十九日宣布動員令，次日又否認之，實際中共自八月初以來，即已動員一切力量，向政府軍攻擊，其全面攻勢在山東江蘇之陳毅部已集中向蘇北攻擊，豫北晋東之劉伯誠部，已集中向陳海路攻擊，山西之賀龍張家口之聶榮臻綏遠之姚喆，熱河之蕭克四部，均集中圍攻大同、晋東南之陳賡部，則向太原以南洪洞越城臨汾攻擊，以上所有在華北中井之軍隊，已全面動員作戰，另外僅東北之林彪部，因四平街一役被擊潰後，現在整理，故未發動攻勢，勿論中共否認動員，或宣佈動員，實際已全部動員向政府攻擊，此一點人人應認清不可被宣傳所迷惑。</p>
<p>（二）政府正準備改組，召開國民大會，並薈萃眾意，審議憲章，準備實施憲政，如中共之共產主義及其流血恐怖政策為人民所支持，自可於改組政府時取得其合法地位，不應在政府準備實施憲政與其談判時，公然宣佈動員，向政府攻擊，此非政黨之爭，而為以武力發動內亂，致使八年來鮑受戰苦之人民重受戰禍與經濟之困苦，並將八年犧牲所造成之國際光榮地位一旦毀隳，為全世界所輕視此種是非順逆，應明辨之。</p>
<p>（三）時局癥結，根本不同之觀點：（一）中國共產黨之主義中無民族主義，故其本身利害重於國家民族之利害；（二）中國共產黨攻擊政府不民主，僅認為其土地革命，恐怖流血階級鬥爭，農工專政為民主；（三）政府希望一切以商談解決，故必須實行整軍協議，使軍隊國家化，不以武力為政爭之工具，而中共則不實行整軍協議，一面商談，一面以武力發動內亂，並以武力維持其割據地區之共產主義政治形式，此種局面，是否為一面參加政府，造成一個政府中有兩個政府使其顛覆，一面以武力割據造成一個國家中有兩個國家之陰謀；（四）政府要求修復交通，俾物資流通，經濟復員，中共則破壞鐵道，使人民更趨貧困，政府租借美國物資，購買美國剩餘物資使戰後物資缺乏之人民，得以逐漸恢復經濟生活，中共則反之，俾中國人人赤貧，以便其赤化；（五）政府朝夕祈求統一，安定建設，俾此經濟落後之國家，不失建國機會，中共則造成騷動破壞恐怖，以便其政策之完成，以上幾種根本不同之觀點，如以國家民族為前提，則一切不難迎刃而解，否則不過為中共實行其政策之一種手段而已。</p>
<p>蔡將軍談話完畢後，本報記者曾提詢若干問題，承分為解答：（一）安平事件，現正由第二十五執行小組繼續調查。惟現已發生困難，蓋中共對政府區各人民所提出之證件，竟拒不承認；（二）執行說；（三）棗莊以早已陷入中共之手，現該地執行小組，僅有美方代表而已。蔡將軍旋以堅定之口吻語記者稱：現共軍集中全力侵犯隴海綫及蘇北一帶，並無力量騷擾平津，故平津治安可確保無虞又蔡將軍定三日飛京，向國防部述職，報告數月來電事調處工作情形，在京將有三四日之勾留，然後返平。</p>

<h3>浙閩贛三省設綏靖指揮部</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州三十一日電〕綏靖主任余漢謀，昨分電浙閩贛各省府，通知設立浙江，福建，江西三省綏靖指揮部，統轄三省一部份之保安部隊，總指揮由總部委派，副總指揮三人，由各省自委，其所需之一切經費，則由三省分担，浙省已轉舫保安處照辦。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺卅一日電〕邵力子卅一日午謁主席，報告此次參政會駐委會呼籲和平經過，請示參政會召開日期，並與主席共進午餐。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十一日電〕參政會駐會委會三十日例會，除通過籲請政府及中共迅即停止軍事衢突，實現和平統一案，及檢舉何德奎案再請政府迅交司法機關辦理並答覆兩項決議外，並通過下列要案：（一）在此匯率提高物價隨漲之今日，應請政府迅速採取有效措施，力謀穩定物價，以免動搖國家經濟基礎案。（二）注意因外匯調整平空刺激物價上漲，應採有效辦法制止，以維人民之生活案。（三）請本會通電全國擁護政府調整外匯藉維國內生產事業案，決議保留。（四）請政府速派工礦專家赴美參加賠償委員會工作，確保我國權益案。（五）請政府排除一切困難，迅速恢復交通，增進生產，平抑物價，督促减租，以安民生而固國本案。（六）河南省黨部書記長張炎茂被人暗殺已久，兇手始終未獲，請政府加緊緝兇歸案法辦案。（七）請政府通令各軍事機關，不得擅包交通工具，以利交通案。（八）請政府嚴查軍車肇禍事件，並迅定有效管制辦法，以維民命案，（九）請政府明白宣示對巨奸週逆佛海，丁逆默邨，及華北之蘇逆體仁，何以迄今不交付司法機關依法審判之理由，並請即日交付法辦，以釋羣疑而彰國法案。（十二）為上海市警察局非法查禁再生雜誌提出責問，籲請轉陳政府，予以制止。切實保障言論自由案。</p>

<h3>青年團二全會今晨揭幕主席民主作風備受推崇</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺卅一日電〕青年團二全大會九月一日九時行開幕興禮，會期改定十日，蔣兼團長將親臨主持。開幕後即舉行預備會議，推定主席團及決定議事日程。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺卅一日電〕青年團本屆中央幹事監察最後一次聯席會議卅一日晨十時在傳習學舍舉行，出席八十餘人，部力子主席，當議決改進團務要案多件，移送二全大會討論。蔣兼團長於十一時曾蒞會致訓。又出席二全大會代表今分就各公共場所舉行小親會議，整個牯嶺已為學術空氣所籠罩。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺卅一日電〕青年國中幹會監察聯席會議，蔣兼團長蒞會致訓，大意謂：關於青年團之性質與隸屬問題，議論甚多，各有理由，各有利弊，余對此並無成見，唯依出席大多數人之意見為意見，蔣兼團長此種民主作風，博得全場一致之推崇。</p>
<h3>中共秘密文件　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>第一，這種戰略，只有各部隊，在統一指揮下一致行動，與互相配合的基礎上，才能收到實效，過去長春的放棄，多少含有各部隊各不相顧的因素，在現在國民黨軍進攻我們的過程中，如果我們不能克服這種現象，只有易給國民黨以各個擊破的便利，布這裏我們要指責過去各個集國軍不能一致行動的錯誤與損失，第二，這種戰略決不是冒進政策，但必須以調動擴大的武裝羣眾，作壓迫國民黨軍陣勢，加緊在國民黨軍內部的瓦解工作為主要的戰略，然後再以我們的主力，突擊他們的弱點，這樣，他們沒有不潰散的，廣大的士兵羣眾，沒有不轉向我們的，上次攻取歸綏的經騐，都明白教訓我們，軍事上最重要缺點，便在我們沒有大規模戰爭的準備，軍事指揮還不能集中，行動還不能一致，尤其嚴重的，是國民黨軍士兵中，特別是他們作戰的主要部隊中，一無我們的工作，致已動搖的士兵中，不能立刻與我們發生聯系，這是何等重大的損失。</p>
<p>2.目前國民黨軍的進攻，雖其中還有許多弱點，但總的形勢，確已逐漸反守為攻，因此現在我們便要迅速壓迫他們回到反攻為守的地位，在現在他們的動員中，還有很多軍隊，不能一下子抽調轉來，調轉來的，也不是一下子都加入進攻我們的前綫，他們中間還有很多為爭奪地盤，或懼怕喪失地盤的衝突和遲疑，尤其是國民黨軍隊中，士兵厭惡戰爭與傾向我們的動搖心理，都足以减少他們進攻我們的聲勢，我們要抓住他們這些弱點針對着這些弱點，很迅速的執行壓迫他們的進攻戰略，我們決不能等待，等待便是讓他們取得優勢，我們決不能退守，退守只是死路一條，我們決不能孤守一地，孤守一地是給他們造成包圍的機會，我們更不能再作兜圈式的游擊，兜圈式的游擊，將使我們沒有後防，沒有陣地，以至喪失一切根據地，我們正確的戰術，是在以集團軍作主力的大規模作戰中，要調動最廣大的武裝羣眾，在他們軍隊的前後左右，發動最廣泛的游擊戰，以疲憊他們，截斷一切交通運輸，以圍困他們，遣派工農羣眾中，八路軍，新四軍中，尤其是俘擄過來的士兵中的，得力份子，走到他們軍隊中，作有力的鼓動，以動搖他們的兵心，這樣來，便能利於我們的進攻，和對他們施行各個擊破的突擊，因此，我們在解放區中，八路軍，新四軍中，就必須集中火力，皮對主要的右傾危臉，在現在，一切分散政策，上山主義，兜圈子式的游擊逃跑觀念，很有復活的可能，同時左傾的沒有聯系，沒有配合的冒進政策，反對集中，反對一致的散亂行動，也同樣是給國民黨的各個擊破的機會的解放區的黨和軍，必須以極堅定的布爾希維克態度，與之鬥爭，這樣才能保障八路軍，新四軍在一致行動和集中指揮之下，來回答國民黨的進攻，來擊破他們的主力。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>中國報人的自我檢討</h3>
<p>今日為抗戰勝利後第二次記者節。去年今日，正在舉世騰歡慶祝勝利之際，尤其在淪陷甚久方慶光復的上海，或未能充分發揮記者節的意義。但一年後的今日，我們又欣逢此一佳節，緬懷過去，展望將來，真是感想萬千。記者節是我們報人自己的節日，一年一度，實在就是我們自我檢討最妤的機會。今日度此佳節，我們除熱烈慶祝而外，尚須自省自勵，積極負起革新報業之任務。</p>
<p>戰前我國新聞事業，向稱落後，不論在內容方面或技術方面，持與報業先進各國相較，膛乎其後。但在抗戰期間，經過八年來的刻苦努力，獲得長足的進步。在外表上，雖因物質條件的欠缺，我國報紙自尚難充分表現現代報業的特色；但檢其內容，確能盡現代報紙對於政治經濟社會文化的任務，不特能領導輿論，作為民眾的喉舌，抑能以最迅速的方法，報道正確消息，成為人民一日不可缺少的精神食糧，而對於宣揚國策維繫人心，更收到極大的功效。尤其是在淪陷區的報人，雖在敵偽利誘與威脅之下，仍能站在報人的崗位，盡其忍辱負重的任務。其間除了少數敗類，覥顏事仇，為虎作倀，盤踞報館，獻媚敵寇者外，報人可歌可泣的壯烈故事，如朱惺公先生輩，書不勝書，足徽中國報人大都具有「富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈」的大丈夫氣概，可為國史增尤。本市記者公會除於今日慶祝之外，特定於明日上午，追悼上海新聞界抗戰殉難烈士，實含有深長的意義。</p>
<p>但在說明各項優點與特色之餘，中國新聞界仍掩飾不了內在的缺陷。我們不能諱言，中國新聞事業還是落後。</p>
<p>放眼看看世界報業的情形，很明顯的有着兩個趨勢：對外而言，各國莫不要求國際新聞自由；對內而論，則要求言論自由。因為經過這次大戰慘痛的教訓，各國識者莫不認為這次大戰的禍根，埋在戰前國際新聞的隱秘與偽裝，今後如欲締造世界和平，且希望其能維持久遠，則必須謀得國際新聞的自由。只要是現任新聞記者，就可以到世界任何一國，自由採訪新聞，不受任何限制，自由傳遞消息，不受當地檢查，且可自由刋載新聞，不受何種干涉。這一個劃時代的國際運動，除了蘇聯一國而外，其他各國大半都參加了。同時，一般愛好和平的人士又認為，戰後的世界如欲踏入和平民主的新時代，則各國國內言論自由，也是一個不可缺少的條件。言論自由，是民主政治的生命；沒有言論自由，就沒有民主可言。政治設施如果不許人民自由發表批評的意見，也就不會有進步。因此，戰後各國的人民，莫不要求言論自由。我國受了國際潮流的激動，也正向着這個目標邁進。</p>
<p>經過我國報人一年來的努大，不論是對於國際新聞自由運動或是國內言論自由，都有相當的成就。惟按目前的情形，仍難令人完全滿意。第一，我國報館及通訊社，派在國外的記者，為數有限，且在傳遞消息的設備上，更是相形見絀，在世界的大都會，例如華盛頓，倫敦，巴黎，莫斯科等處，連一個直接通報的無綫電台也沒有。所以，我國雖己參加國際新聞自由運動，但在實際上享受這個自由的不是中國報人。第二，國內言論自由，政府雖已三令五申，通飭地方政府尊重維護，同時政府對於新聞檢查辦法也早經撤消，但是各地報館的橫被搗毀，報人的痛遭毆辱，甚至狐假虎威，濫施逮捕，仍是屢見不鮮，而最近杭州尚有這類不法的事件。在記者節的今日，我們不能不深感遺憾，尤其不能不提出嚴重的抗議。</p>
<p>可是話又得說回來。我們報人雖被號稱為「無冕帝王」，究竟不是惟我獨尊的帝王。我們要自由，但我們也得守法律。自由決非一任我們衝破藩籬隨心所欲之謂。越是能尊重他人自由的人，越是能充分享有自由的人，報人亦不能外乎此例。我們必須自我檢討：報道新聞有沒有失實的地方？發表言論有沒有偏蔽的地方？政治是否能因我們的議論而有所改善？社會是否會因我們的新聞而更趨墮落？我們的一枝筆，不但有關於當前國家的榮辱，世界的安危，而且影響所及，幾乎可以說十年百年乃至數世紀人類的運命，均擊於報人之手。民主國家重視輿論，政治大勢以輿論趨向為指歸。可見越要民主，報人越要珍重自己的一枝筆。我們臨此佳節，深懷「一言興邦，一言喪邦」之戒。建國伊始，珍重珍重！</p>
<h3>異哉！中共的全面作戰</h3>
<p>我們最歡喜聽的，是「無條件停戰」的呼聲；我們最怕見的，是「全面作戰」的方略。有了全面作戰的打算，決不會願意無條件停戰；如果具備無條件停戰的誠意，也決不再有興趣來計劃全面作戰的方略。然而，這兩樣不能並存的東西，中國共產黨竟兼而有之了，豈非大奇？</p>
<p>中央社北平電，從共軍俘虜搜獲中共中央的秘密指示，其全文見於今天本報。匆促瀏覽，不能詳論，而有一點，為人人所感覺的，就是這篇指示作職方略的秘密文件，是充瀟了火藥氣味。它一則說，「要能深入的擴大八路軍新四軍」，「要能有陣地進行大規模的作戰」，「要能……建立起來一個全國解放政權」；再則說，「厲行後備武裝正規戰的訓練」，「取得點線上有戰略形勢的城市」，「確定晋冀察聯接到豫魯蘇北為一大區域，……成為解放區的中央根據地」。這些，都充分表示了中共確早準備了大打特打，大殺特殺；虧他們竟還能在口頭上大喊和平，大喊無條件停戰！</p>
<p>最可注意的，我們以往還認為中共至多不過想擁兵割據，分裂中國，憑此「資本」以參與中央政權，殊不料中共在這篇文件裏已經不各氣而露骨的指出了奪取政權的道路。它反對「偏安割據」，反對「劃疆自守」，反對「躱避入山」；它不再容許綏遠，包頭，大同，北平，保定，石家莊，滄州，濟南，泰安，徐州，唐山，榆關再在國軍手中。質言之，中共今天已經不以局部割據偏安一隅為滿足，而認為在談判停戰的過程中，已可動員所謂廣大的農民羣眾，奪取中國整個的政權了。這真不愧為「全面作戰」的方略！</p>
<p>司徒大使昨天在滬招待記者，說「民生政體必需善良人民支持之」，可謂一語破的。可惜中國今日，雖有善良的人民，却中間橫梗着口唱和平而心懷戰亂的共產黨，處心積慮想用武力來奪取政權，這是中國民主政治前途的致命傷。司徒大使雖有滿腔熱忱，希望先談國府改組，再及其他，以求和平解決之道，不知在中共的全面作戰方略之下，究竟能否如願以償？</p>
<h3>從配售談到棉紗</h3>
<p>勝利後，一切物價管制的法令，統已取消。但以物價不斷地上漲，國計民生，所受到的威脅太大，於是種種配售的辦法，復陸續推行。最先辦的是外匯和黃金，次為煤米，又次為油糖，最近復推及到棉紗。</p>
<p>這些配售的辦法，在理想上，雖未必能盡如人意，但於抑平物價和取締投機這兩點上觀祭，無疑地已收到相當的效果。</p>
<p>昨日紗價復漲，油糖黑市，近來也頗猖獗。有人很懷疑到這種辦法到底能否穩定物價。我們認為從大體上說：在物價管制未能切實施行以前，上面所舉種種配售，都不能不說是救急的良方。而且在所有物資未能完全把握到的時侯，除掉設法配售以外，實在也沒有其他更為周妥的對策。</p>
<p>話雖如是，我們對於實施的方案，却認為應該改進的地方，還確乎不少。至少限度，凡是配售的貨物，其價格的上落，總須肥握得住，不可仍依黑市為轉移。所有半公開或完全公開的黑市，縱不能完全消滅，也須鎮壓得住，不能讓牠公然無忌，減殺配售的效力，乃至擾亂配售的行市。照現狀看來，這些乘機漁利，擾亂物價的情形，實在太猖狂了。</p>
<p>我們知道，凡是一種辦法，要求牠推行盡利，必須得到各方面的合作。所以官辦的配售，須要民眾誠意合作；商辦的配售，也須要政府盡力協助。外來的助力不够，當然要影饗到本身；本身的缺點太多，也無法達到預期的目的。棉紗的配售如此，其他的配售，也透不出這個例子。</p>
<p>這次棉紗的配售，其主動力顯然在民營廠家。在配售上，可稱創舉。我們期望各方面予以切實的支持，也希望他自身再求改進，切實穩定紗價，千萬不要讓黑市依舊猖獗！</p>

<h3>菲當局決心平內亂　大規模戰事爆發　農民遊擊隊繳械限期屆滿</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼剌三十一日電〕呂宋島中部今日有大規模戰事爆發，勢將　成公開之內戰。有數處憲兵曾用大砲轟擊農民抗日游擊隊。政府限令交出軍械之期，截至星期日止，今則平解決業已無望。政府領袖之談話及行動，均頗堅決。憲兵將於星期日出動搜查槍砲，如有私藏者殺無赦。紐伐愛西迦省長貝爾芒特向民衆大會宣稱，共和政府於九月份起，將用飛機戰車大砲及炸彈平亂。憲兵處宣布，在紐伐愛西迦及蒲拉根兩省會有數處發生大規模戰事，憲兵用大砲轟擊農民抗日游擊隊之集中地點，游擊隊以機關槍還擊，但終至潰散。農民領袖番利之被綁架，已引起農民猜疑，　魯克等高級領袖乃相率趨避，以免蹈其覆轍，據稱，平民自衛隊之武裝一日存在，農民抗日游擊隊即一日不繳出軍械，政府決定復用平民自衛隊，重行武裝，此爲和平解決農民問題之最大障碍。據內政部長稱，不僅呂宋島中部，全島平民自衛隊皆將與以適當之武裝，以協助維持治安，所謂武裝和平」，即政府擁有之武裝隊伍愈多，其政策愈有成功之望，不法份子在搗亂前，必將三思而行云。</p>

<h3>烏克蘭對希控訴案　安理會延期討論　蘇代表倆終未得逞　對英美神經戰將左進一步行動</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕安全理事會三十日開會，討論烏克蘭對希臘之控訴案，英蘇兩國代表又展開一塲激辯。據合衆社電，蘇代表葛羅米柯主張邀請島克蘭代表出席陳述理由，英代表亞歷山大猛烈反對，討論數小時之久，主席宣佈提付表決，結果蘇聯提議祗獲巴西·澳洲·墨西哥·荷蘭及波六票贊同，因此未獲通過，按安理會中議案須有七票方能通過。蘇聯之急欲立即討論此案，原因自在希臘將於今日（九月一日）舉行公民投票，此舉可予一嚴重打擊，但現旣被否決，此案將延至下次開會時再行討論。而下次會議將於九月三日舉行希臘選舉已過。英代表於爭取時間一點已吿成功，而蘇代表之伎倆，終未得逞。又關於蘇代表葛羅米柯前向會中提議，要求聯合國家將其在敵國以外領土留駐軍隊之情形，詳細呈報一事，曾引起安理會中軒然大波，其餘波直至今晨仍無消退之象。此間一般人印象，以爲蘇聯代表乘各代表不及防備之際，突然提出此案，或爲一種策略，殆即蘇聯神經戰略之一部份，蘇聯此種行動，係暗示蘇聯準備進一步有所作爲。本年初安理會討論伊朗問題時，英美指責蘇聯在伊朗留駐軍隊之不法，蘇聯則力辯駐軍曾得伊朗政府同意。此際蘇聯爲希臘問題及國外駐軍問題，反責英美，英美自可援引前例以自衛。要而言之，西方集團與蘇聯集團間之政治鴻溝，愈掘愈深，現無任何跡象證明短期內有任何接近之可能。</p>
<h3>共取政權　美國表示反對</h3>

<h3>紐倫堡法庭審訊結束　納要犯作最後申訴　本月下旬開秘庭討論宣判書</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合息〕紐倫堡國際軍事法庭審訊德戰犯，迄已九閱月，昨（八月三十一日）夜結束，廿一名德首要戰犯今日出庭作最後申訴。各犯與其初入被吿席時判若兩人，九月來不斷聽取檢察官提出彼等所犯種種違犯人道之罪行，心理及生理上已起變化。據法國新聞社訊，國社然代表赫斯謂：「余不能承認外國人干涉德國內政，余曾爲希特勒元首最忠實之僕役，余並無遺憾。前外長里賓特洛甫繼起發言，謂「余僅有一事感覺犯罪者，即爲本人外交政策之失敗，但此乃對我同胞而言，非對法庭而言，凡爾賽和約之不公，導致第二次大戰，後世歷史必能證明。」戈林於昨日之申辯中，間接透露後悔之意，謂「余堅決聲明，余向來反對任何屠殺與暴行，且如爲余權力所及，則定必加以阻止。余絕無奴役外國之野心，余之惟一目標，不過爲愛護吾祖國同胞，並爲彼等之幸福與自由而奮鬥而已。」杜尼資海軍上將亦辯稱，德海軍並未從事不人道之潛艇戰爭。前波希米亞與摩拉維亞納粹總督史屈萊契爲重要反猶人物，今竟將一切集體屠殺之責任，置於希特勒及希姆萊兩人身上。</p>

<h3>日賠償計劃擬就　蘇聯搬走東九省物資　無權分享日國內資產　我將接受境內日有資產</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅一日電〕據此間外交界人士談稱：聯合國已擬就日本之賠償計劃，依照此項計劃，蘇聯不得分配日國內資產，因蘇聯拒絕以中國東九省境內前日本所有資產列入賠償項目，致遠東委會不能組成綜合賠價委會，以通盤籌劃賠償事宜。依照美國賠償專員飽萊估計，蘇聯自東九省搬出之工業設備，價値達廿萬萬美元。在此情形之下，盟國決定對日國內資產作個別交涉，將蘇聯剔出於享受分配國之外，同時，中國將接受其境內之日舊有資產。美國與加拿大對日本之賠償鮮加關切，日國內資產之主要接收國，爲荷屬東印度，菲律濱，英國各自治領，及法屬越南云。</p>

<h3>錢大受審　大談儲備票　一切責任推在周佛海身上</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕僞中央儲備銀行副總裁錢大槪，昨日上午由高院劉航桂庭長親自開庭提詢，錢衣淺灰紡綢長衫，黑布鞋，蓄有長髮，帶一摺扇，身材不高，視其外形，與陳公博頗相似。押上庭後，由劉庭長一一質詢。錢供：現年四十九歲，江蘇太倉人，住　園路一〇一五號，天津北洋法政專門學校商科畢業，後又留學日本明治大學硏究科，歸國後任金城銀行大連分行經理，廿七年秋僞維新政府成立籌組僞華興銀行時，曾派人來大連邀我參加，經堅決拒絕，廿九年因金城銀行開行務會議乃來滬出席，時汪精衛周佛海已出走來滬，本人與周戰前即相識，一次偶然相遇，周談及此來係爲維持東南半壁民生，當時本人不加深信，仍回大連，但該地處境甚爲困難，審判長當能明瞭。本人在東北躭得很長，對於九一八事件甚爲明瞭，回滬後乃力勸周佛海，不可相信日人之言，周仍言此來係爲維特東南半壁之民生，你跟我做事，與中央做事一樣。</p>
<p>當時本人爲環境所逼，及因一時愛國心之衝動，乃於廿九年五月參加僞府，是年底儲備銀行籌組成立，其第一目的即爲打倒敵軍票，予以取消，其組織包括四局（業務·發行·國庫、外匯）三處（總務·調查·稽核），由周佛海任總裁，本人任副總裁。自卅年一月至卅一年四月間，並兼上海分行經理，以後即辭去兼職、由戴藹廬接充，副總裁之職權爲承總裁之命，輔助總裁辦理行務、但周佛海很獨裁，於卅年開始時，即命一切對內對外之文件簽呈，非經總裁親筆批示，不生效力，故本人沒有什麼事情可辦。卅一年五月規定以法幣二元折合僞幣一元調換事，原因不詳。此係偽中央政治會議所決定，被吿無資格參加，其結果共收回四十五億法幣，僞幣之行使界限向北僅至徐州爲止，其發行額於去年九月辦理移交時共爲三萬八千萬萬元（高檢處之起訴書則稱共四萬六千萬萬元，被吿之辯護律師向庭上聲稱：被吿於卅四年九月移交淸楚，但至卅五年一月尙有新僞幣發行，此事請庭上調查），中儲行以法幣作資本，共一萬元，其準備金已於去年移交中央銀行，共計金條五萬二千多根，美金票五百五十萬，純銀七百六十多萬兩，以及其他不自　等、被吿在職時並未利用戰　上之便利囤積投機或放款博利、當時因現鈔短少而發生之貼現現象，亦經本人設法消滅。勝利前本人曾向敵正金等銀行追回借去之金條甚多，勝利後又與周佛海共同維持治安金融之責·故本人之參加偽府動機係被逼被誘，參加後祗顧事務，對行政或原則上從未有發言或建議，而被吿始終相信周佛海係奉命來陷區負維持東南半壁之責云。庭諭該案改期再訊，被吿還押。</p>

<h3>林案判決書理由</h3>
<p>上海高等法院特種刑事判決（三十五年度特字第二五六號）公訴人本院檢察官，被吿林康侯，男，年七十一歲，上海人，僞商統會秘書長，住上海林森中路四六八弄E一〇二號。選任辯護人江一平律師，傅况鱗律師。</p>
<p>右被吿因漢奸案件，經檢察官起訴，本院判決如左：（事實略）（理由）本件被吿林康侯，歷任僞全國商業統制總會理事秘書長及常務理事，其秘書長一職，係秉承僞理事長之命辦理文書及會內事務等情，迭據在本院及偵查中供認不諱，核與其所具之自白書所載之情形悉相脗合，其先任僞理事，每月開會一次，後任僞常務理事，每週開會一次，討論會務及物資之收買配給等事項，亦有調案之僞全國商統會理事會議紀錄可黃參證，事實已臻明確，按僞全國商業統制總會係推行敵僞新經濟政策之總機構，其主要任務在辦理統制物資之收買及配給（見偽全國商業統制總會暫行條例）自係利於敵僞而不利於本國，被吿參加此項團體，並担任要職，依　治漢奸條例第三條之規定，自應搆成同條例第二條第一項第一款之罪，其所持之辭解的分四點：（一）被吿在敵人嚴密監視之下，行動已失自由，不得已始就僞職，</p>
<p>非自願</p>
<p>變節投僞者比。（二）被吿在唐壽民任僞理事長時期，對於會務不理不聞，一無行爲可言。（三）迨聞蘭亭出任僞理事長時期，被邀担任偽秘書長，僅辦理文書事務，一面緊縮會務，以便結束。（四）會營救地下工作人員楊於愼，以利抗戰等情。關於第一點，查被吿於太平洋戰事發生後，被敵軍由香港押回上海，行動不能完全自由，雖屬事實，但其出任偽商統會理事，旣係由於偽政府之指派，且不能證明當時曾受任何强暴脅迫而達於不能抗拒之程度，則其附僞即非無考慮之餘地，况其</p>
<p>擔任偽職</p>
<p>前後歷二年之久，中間當不致一無引避機會，乃一再聯任，直至勝利時爲止，謂非出於自願，顯係托詞。關於第二點，按僞商統會之決議案，爲出席僞理事總意思之表現，被吿於另案判決之唐壽民任僞理事長時，每月出席偽理事會一次旣爲其所自承，則其對於該決議案自應負相常責任，核與司法院第三一〇一號解釋所謂須有犯罪行爲之條件，自屬相合，不得籍口不理不聞，冀圖諉卸。關於第三點，查被吿担任僞商統會秘書長，係秉承僞理事長之命辦理文書及日常事務，固屬實情，但</p>
<p>偽商統會</p>
<p>爲推行敵僞新經濟政策之總機構，已如上述，被吿與僞理事長旣有意思之聯絡，而分担一部犯罪之行爲，自係共同正犯，至所任職務是否首要，辦理範圍有無縮小等情，僅能供量刑之參考，要與犯罪之成立無涉。關於第四點，查被吿營救地下工作人員楊於愼，據該證人述稱：被　這據說，由其家屬轉托被吿營救等語，仍不外徇友人之請託爲私人緩頰，尙不足以語於有利人民之行爲，以上種種抗辯，均不能爲其免責或減刑之論據。惟查被告於僞國民政府成立時，</p>
<p>拒不參加</p>
<p>會被下令通緝，有呈案之報紙可　，當時尙不失爲潔身自愛。迨太平洋戰事發生，被敵軍由港押送來滬行動復受限制，處境不無艱難，祗以其向在金融界頗有地位，卒被派充僞商統會理事兼秘書長，究與自始甘心附逆者不無區別，且在偽職任內，尙無顯著惡行，密核其犯罪之動機，偽非毫無可原之餘地，爰依　治瑛奸條例第二條第二項法定刑範圍內，酌量科處，其全部財產旣在軍統局供明在卷，除酌留家屬必需生活費外，</p>
<p>倂於沒收</p>
<p>次查起訴書所稱，被吿將其合資經營之合羣化學廠改組爲美利化學廠製造酒精資敵一層，據被吿辯稱：伊僅担任合　廠董事長，至合　廠租與美利廠後，並未任職，對於美利廠之　務概不負責，質之合影人王植三，所供亦同，是被吿對於美利廠旣無關係，無論該廠有無以酒精資敵情事，要難律以任何罪名·至其充任僞上海市政府諮詢委員，訊無且體犯行，亦應免置議。</p>
<p>據十輪結</p>
<p>應依特種利事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，　治漢奸條例第一條·第三條·第二條第一項第一款、同修第二項，第八條第一項，第九條·刑法第二條第一項，前段第二十八條，第五十七條，第三十七條、第二項，判決如主文、本案經檢察官瞿鎔蒞庭　行執務，中華民國卅五年八月三十一日上海高等法院刑事庭審判長推長劉毓桂、推事曹駿，邱煥灝。</p>
<h3>中紡被訴舞幣案　經澈查證明不確</h3>
<p>關於中紡公司被訴接收敵資平售門市部新興公司高級職員舞弊及中紡公司內部組織不健全，發生流弊一案，淸查團已派員併案澈查，茲悉，該案原呈所訴，將少數物資低價應市零售，而將大批物資批發向掮客推銷一節不確·經調取該新興公司門售與批發對照表查核，並與該公司銷貨日報表核對，大致無訛，關於原呈所訴：其出售之價格比市價低比門市標價高數倍，得款照門市很低標價報銷，盈餘由疋頭部張徐兩人在外開房間分贓，時有發生吵鬧，據說每人每月可得外快幾千萬元等情，經查詢該新興公司經理虞乃丹，據稱，公司物品價格依照下孤四種標準估價：（一）式樣及商標爲日人習用關係，（二）尺寸種類顏色等之不齊備，（三）毁損及破爛關係，（四）拋棄一部份利潤關係，估價之後製成售價報吿表，每日先送總公司核定，財政部及處理局委託代售貨價，由中紡公司規定，但售價必然較底價爲高，其批發者比市價相低，亦有全照市價者，所有收益，全部列賬歸公等語。經查核該公司銷貨日報表，大致尙屬相符，原呈所訴高出標價數倍，殆不可能。至英文呈訴涉及中紡公司內部組織問題及其流弊，與接收處理工作無關，故未調查。</p>

<h3>期貨及現貨香　少數廠未接單子　紡建布掛牌尚未更動　小廠冷牌紗銷路不振</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡建昨日開布，廠家號家請購者，仍極擁擠，掛牌表面上未動，惟B龍頭細布五萬六千，恰等於匯票變動以前正牌之價，而花色貨如電光斜及四君子嗶嘰等，價亦較十九日以前略加，特其所加者有限，繼較黑市爲便宜耳，門售字號之遠在四郊者，昨亦有多家前來開貨，市塲上出賣轉手貨者，仍是一片加四千加五千之聲浪，幸黑市已跌去一二千元，則人心似已略定耳。前日在紡建等機構管制下民營紗廠所集中開派之貨，原定依各廠錠子攤派，以其開價而言，誠已較黑市减去二十萬左右，市上雖朱至於「吃飽」，而六千數百件之紗，要已吸去銀根不少·所惜尙有少數紗廠，朱曾接單子，則此集中派貨之機構，究應如何加强，尙待紡建當局之努力，雙馬自是最吃價之牌子，條桿細長，廣帮最爲樂用，申新目下開有紗錠三十餘萬，出數當然可觀，惟此貨向以開期貨爲原則，現貨之批派，並不容易，故本市實用廠家，並不鞦迎，紗廠方面明知其原因，前日開貨時仍　重號家，良以雙馬牌子太恃號家襯托，不容不相當報答也，其他之明牌貨，情形的略與此相同，至於冷牌小廠，聞仍是苦樂不均，常州貨同是二十支，有僅售一百萬稍零，尙乏受主，因此有觀察家指陳，前日紗廠集中所開之紗，仍有大部份將流爲市上之籌碼云，熟悉市面情形者推測，民營紗價派價如能立定，紡建或將酌加其掛牌云。</p>
<p>又訊，昨日紗市一致上騰，緣上日民營紗廠雖爲協助當局，開出每件四百磅裝璜之棉紗數千件，開價照市價低十萬至廿萬，照理市價應可壓小，然各廠所拋出之紗，俱非現貨，約期十天以後，陸續派交，有遲至一月以上者，是以客帮立須應銷者，深惑遠水不能救近火，因此放價搜羅現貨，趕裝舟車，故昨市現貨價奇俏，念支漲五萬至十萬，四十一一支約漲十五萬至廿萬，人心異常榮欣，允以紡建出品之日廠老牌念支，漲勢最烈，豐年藍鳳俱已復出一百四十萬大關·</p>
<h3>金鈔平穩</h3>
<p>烚赤昨平穩萬分，晨開二〇六萬五，開後仍有相當壓力，逐漸下游，降至二〇四萬五，始吿穩定，十時後央行以二〇五萬五之價配給九二條，午刻站定二〇六萬以上，午後稍疲，惟因週六關係，交易不多，結果較前收微降四千，飾金紋銀銀元均無變動，暗拆銀根大緊，普通息價雖站一角半左右，間有特殊浩大需用者，竟扳高至二角以上。</p>
<p>外幣更爲平和，晨開美鈔三三三〇元有供，低價退至三三二〇元，此後始終在三三二〇元至三三三五元之間徘徊，午後稍形不振，結果較前收下跌十五元，港票受申電報長至一四一元强影響，廣帮爲吸收銀根，續有塞出，退至七〇〇元左右，結果再跌五元，港電七一五元，印匯八六二元，英匯一一四五元，均有供售，成交不多，美匯仍站牌價。</p>
<h3>公債微降</h3>
<p>公債初疲後穩，多頭仍不乏了結者，然因某號代金融界某銀行吸收票面二百餘萬元，得此助力，終被拉上，局勢不定，統丙二三〇〇元，開後有多方數家斬售，低價退至二〇三〇元，而後有買戶參加，逐漸盤升至二六〇〇元，仍遭出籠所壓迫，最後仍屈居二四〇〇元以下，結果較前收微降五十元，餘者甲乙戊升五十元，統丁則平。</p>
<h3>白煤回姜</h3>
<p>陽泉白煤塊國聯輪續有運到，該輪煤商同業原訂倉額一千二百噸，後因津地現貨不易收集，故僅運來三百餘噸，到貨雖微，然市塲聞有到貨，市况頓轉鬆動，市價微見回降。</p>
<h3>秦皇島煤運　不久可恢復</h3>
<p>近日報載秦皇島煤運發生阻礙，這市用煤各戶有焦慮，據燃委會徐主委樂天宣布，關於秦皇島開灤煤運中斷之訊，實係臨時性質，不久即可全部恢復原狀，且礦區已有嚴密保護，昨日業將被破壞鐵路逐一修復，雖續有破壞，而開灤仍能運出七千噸，查上海現有在煤，足敷東南各省三個個月之用，所以毋須慮及燃料恐慌，尤其基隆及其他來源，逐月可以增加供應，更可無憂，徐主委並附帶聲明，關於燃委會配煤價格，決不增加，雖該會供應公用事業鐵路船舶及主要用途達總數百分之八十六，其售價　在成本之下云。</p>
<h3>中國銀行　辯低利貸款　扶持國貨廠商　爭取南洋市場</h3>
<p>戰前我工業品運往南洋者，數量頗鉅，戰後南洋市塲，我國貨廠商力謀恢復，惟以利息過高，保險費負祖亦重，且交通梗阻，致我工業產品無法出口，中國銀行有鑒於此，央　辯低利貸款，扶持國貨廠商，使工業產品源源出口，爭取南洋市塲，以達發展國際貿易，凡國貨廠商，欲將工業產品運往南洋銷售者、該行均可辦理押匯，低利貸款，運輸保險，均予便利、如各廠商在南洋各地未設機構者，由國貨聯營公司代爲經銷，該行爲辦理順利起見，特於卅日午後二時，假慈淑大樓邀請各國貨廠商負責人交換意見，經初度會商後，已準備貸款工作，短期內即可實現，其利息以三分以上，五分以下爲原則，正考慮巾，關於出口之工業產品，除紗布以外，各　均擬運往銷售。</p>
<h3>陳針眉創高價</h3>
<p>陳祁門亦有成交</p>
<p>久無躉批走銷之陳針眉，茲據同業消息，本市出口行家均接到海外來電，囑辦上項花色，因此過程遂趨明朗，售價方面，每擔竟創五萬元之高峯，其他花色，午昌大德昌華茶新華汪裕泰等，各有扒取，市氣活躍，而運日英商洋行與貨方談判之高莊陳祁門，亦已獲得成議，由怡和洋行每擔以廿萬〇五千元買進三百卅四箱，</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據業中人云，下月中句，有專船一艘，由本市直駛菲洲加薩勃蘭加，故邇來各行擬將大批紅綠茶准備出口，聞該船係勝利後首次試行，如能順利，嗣後當可繼續，而華茶外銷亦能逐步轉機矣、</p>
<h3>代兌黃金存款辯法　四聯總處加以修正</h3>
<p>戰時後方各行局，黃金折合法幣存款存單，到期在京滬或其他收復區結兌法幣，近由財政部規定，仍應一律向原存行局兌取黃金，嗣中央銀行爲便利存戶，曾擬訂折金存單，由上海各行局代兌辦法，公吿實施，是項辦法，經四聯總處業務檢討會議硏究修正，提奉三一七次理事會決定，已通和各行局遵辦，茲將修正上海各行局代兌黃金折合法幣存款辦法誌次，（一）代兌到期存單，以託收方式處理，（二）存款一律以黃金兌付，（三）不滿一兩之細數，以國幣兌付，但存戶可自行併凑整兩，兌取黃金，（四）兌付前項零星黃金，由代兌行代售于上海中央銀行，（五）兌付前項零數之黃金，其價格依掣給臨時收据之日爲準，</p>
<h3>湘米第一次到滬　市場來源充沛　均告回跌</h3>
<p>昨日米市消化平淡，配米店方乏交，蘇浙皖湘秈米均有抵申，湘米之來，尙係勝利後第一次，品質甚佳，市勢一致下游，陳粳貨少，各秈均凹小一二千元，新粳亦小一二千元，中下等尙少受主，白元略有零星見抵，消化亦懈，麵粉廠方配出仍少，供不敷消，內地吿昂。市勢挺秀，廠盤不動，塲外各略加一二百元，小麥各埠消化停頓，價落千元，成交極稀·黃豆高貨，汕頭納取，形居挺站，中下因消化不爽，回小千元，蠶豆高貨亦俏，上升一二千元，中次平正，苞米靑島續動，再漲五六百元，黃蔴各埠消路停頓，下挫五六百至千元，生仁依然獨居高位，市面牢硬，油價仍居堅穩之局，生油菜油尙多，惟豆油貨稀，豆餅鄉莊及各埠均乏納胃，續疲百元，天津餅猛小六七百元。</p>
<h3>華股漲跌互見　外股一致上升</h3>
<p>華股昨爲第二批便交結束之日，人心忐忑，買方仍有蠢動，銀根奇緊，午刻仍難堅持，中途高價永紗升至六七五元，美亞四二〇〇元景福二六〇元，新光有銀行幫作後盾，買氣最盛，漲至二九七元，勤與爲二〇五元，多方　高終有一部份　售，永紗景福新光勤與都　至低價　旋，美亞尚在中　支撐，冷門各股形式仍好，少數高後微回，結果較前　計永紗　跌，美亞稍漲，小股勤興平平，新光景福亦稍見挫，較冷各中小型股極爲平穩，小型股續吿微升，中型股則升降互見，元老股仍吿穩健。</p>
<p>外股因有西商決定參加證交之訊，引起大量買風，怡紗自九千五升至一萬之大關，英聯自一〇七〇〇元升至一一二〇〇元，各小股若鋼業等漲勢更俏，祥泰木行一萬四成交，結果較前收計怡紗英聯好一成，紙業航業鋼業怡啤各升成半，業廣會德豐好起半成光景。</p>
<h3>證劵公會通告　結束黑市交易</h3>
<p>上海市證劵商業同業公會昨對會員發出通吿云：查上海證券交易所業經定於九月九日開業，凡我同業會員，在交易所開業之前，理應將所有黑市交易即行結束，一俟正式市塲開業後，遵照法令及交易所營業規章辦理，再者同業如有意見，可函本會轉向交易所及主管部申請核辦。</p>
<h3>糖價仍堅</h3>
<p>昨糖市略有零星成交，價仍堅挺，汕提靑爲十三萬七千五百元至五千元，冲提靑十三萬二千元，棉赤十五萬元，漳刀靑十三萬四千元，　赤十三萬七千元。</p>

<h3>「人與鼠」前言</h3>
<p>— 吳永剛</p>
<p>鼠，耗子，牠是生物當中最被人類所憎惡而咀咒的東西。我了天性與其說牠是懦怯，倒不如說牠長陰險狡猾，比較更恰當些。牠仗着身體便捷，寄生在人澡。畫伏夜出，也有膽大的竟敢白畫橫行，擾亂我們生活的安寗。咬壞我們的東西，偷竊我們的糧食，傳播病菌危害我們的生命。假使把鼠類在一年中所破壞的損失做一個統計的話，那一定是一個可驚的數字，不亞於一次可怖的大戰。</p>
<p>記得好像有一個生物學家競過：依照耗子的智慧和牠的生殖能力來說，人類照現在這樣的自相殘殺下去，將來總有一天會給耗子征服了人類，來統治這世界的。耗子是否能進化到征服了人類統治這世界，這大槪要等待若干萬年以後才能得到一個確切的證明，所以暫時可以不必杞人憂天。</p>
<p>但是現在有若干事實證明耗子是可能征服人類統治這世界，因為人類自己本身在逐漸變成耗子！這不是指人類的形態上會變成了耗子，就是說人類的性是在逐漸鼠化。人用懦怯來掩飾他們的陰險狡猾，用貧鄙强暴的手段來獲得一切，更不惜把自己的幸福建築在別人的痛苦上！無論在個人社會與國家民族之間：彼此在傾軋·偸竊·掠奪·甚至放用大屠殺來求一逞，日本在遠東和德意在歐洲所留下暴行的紀錄，也無非是想有暴力來征服愛好自由和平的民族，由他們那些人性在消滅，鼠性在增强的法西斯黨徒來統治這世界。由於人類中兩條腿的耗子在猖狂，所以也可以說耗子可能征服了人類統治這世界。</p>
<p>我們要在這個時代裏像一個人一樣地活下去，那就應該防止自己的鼠化，努力做一個光明磊落的人，負起做人的責任，參加人與鼠的大博鬥，因為惟有撲滅了人中之鼠，肅淸了人類中的鼠性，人類才能永享自由與和平。</p>
<p>「八·一三」抗戰的開始，可以說是全人類同耗子鬥爭的序曲，到現在這悠長的八年間，動盪不安的生活裏，更可以看出誰是人誰是鼠，有的人雖然過着人的生活，可是都變成了耗子，有的人雖然過著非人的生活，可是活着像個人，死也死得像個人，这剧本也就是寫在這時代裏人與鼠的故事。</p>
<p>（吳永剛繼「忠義之家」後，第二部影片「人與鼠」已開始拍攝——編者</p>
<h3>佈景與色彩</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>佈景，此處不僅限於幾塊景片；它包括自然界一切形象，色彩與自然界的鬥爭。它包括劇中人物行動的環境，與全劇氣氛，人物性格的烘托與推進。</p>
<p>它底新的範團是：光景，形象，色彩，情緒，與力。</p>
<p>戲劇藝術，較之一切藝術具體。然而這「具體」，運用到佈景上來，只是最底層的基礎，而在這基礎上建築的，却見：人類底精神和宇宙底力。這才是眞正佈景藝術所走入的藝術境界。</p>
<p>人，因着一切理由在那裏行動，也因着一切行動在那裏轉變着環境，環境亦復轉變着人。他們的關係正同一匹布的經緯，誰也離不開誰。……各個人織着各自的歷史。</p>
<p>問題便在這裏產生，它將隨時跟着人物有着「動展」有着喜怒哀樂，恐怖鬥爭與反抗。幾張固定色彩的景片，已不足以負此重任。因此維也納導演烏邦，他依據法國印象主義者的方法，發明了一種「色點密集法」用他所需要的各種色彩，以密密的小點，分佈於怖景片上、需要紅色時，便投以紅光，使紅色小點顯出，而成一片紅色。同樣，需要綠色時，射綠光，使紅色隱退，綠色顯出。他可以隨着戲劇的演進而變幻着色彩這確是一件智慧的發明。可惜當他每欲求取純色；時便常遭遇到補色殘象的阻礙。又假如射以白光，則所有施塗於景上的色點，均將同時顯露出來。這不能不說是一種遺撼，而在因陋魷簡的我國，連這種「遣憾」的發現，尙遙遙無臨期。</p>
<p>一切色彩，均源於光。光為一切色彩之母。佈景設計除了不易變動的綫條以外，全部動的生命，均操之於光色現景片上固定染色之變幻。運用得宜，可使怖景立起活力，蓬勃而有生氣。跟暴風雨前的風雲一樣，先期地，千變萬化地，昂然地做全劇的使者，邁步響往臻美的藝術園地。否則便像一粒固執的沙粒，永遠抵觸着觀衆的眼珠，破壞你自然的愉快。（其實戲劇的動展，也要像自然一樣的流暢）。</p>
<p>幕啓，最先入目的戲劇環境，情調，氣氛，便是舞合裝置。它不但醞釀着全劇，給全劇發展以暗示，以壓力，領導其前進，同時它還凈化着觀衆的情緒，使觀衆忘失自我，浸沉於戲劇環境中，與劇中人物共哀喜。這樣，劇中人物與觀衆情緒的波動，才能趨於一致。而收到預期的戲劇效果。</p>
<p>悲恤與同情的另一面，便是諷刺與幽默。悲劇需要觀衆沉入凈化，喜劇則永遠要求觀衆保持客觀。色彩在這一方面比綫條更積極，更易於獲得此種期望。</p>
<h3>一週電影短評</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>本週在西片中，精彩的比上週為多了，大體而論，還是「義大尋主」，但麗都上映的「卡薩布蘭加」，則在「義犬尋主」之上。</p>
<p>忠義之家</p>
<p>劇中勝利後在劉瓊滔滔言論聲中，各色各景的影子一陣陣移去，似乎比結束的一段更好。</p>
<p>義大尋主</p>
<p>導演對狗的處理優於人，覓途國家的一段，　西的成績實在「人」之上。</p>
<p>紅塵三客</p>
<p>金片小段精彩的地方極多，惜乎導演沒有把它聯繫得很好，以至該戲變成「沒有十分了不得」，裝置中一架樓梯放得極好，導演在這上面做出了許許多多的戲。</p>
<p>琪恩亞瑟演來最成功。卡萊葛倫次之，因戲本身易於討好，老爾門無大發揮。</p>
<p>直搗哀京</p>
<p>在海軍片中還算是好的，因為導演還顧到如何處理悶的辦法，「海底炸彈」一段為全劇的最高潮，也為最好處，至於水手患盲腸炎開刀，即使為事實，亦可避免，因其無補於大局，演員除卡萊葛倫外，無特出。</p>
<p>寂寞芳心</p>
<p>鏡頭特致，重於美及氣氛。有幾個鏡頭實在是好的，在斷斷續續中很有些極聰明的鏡頭給發現。結尾極好，就好在「美」字，鏡頭向後拉去，顯出火車飛馳，確是一幅最美的圖畫。其他部份的戲導演壓得太厲害，不算最成功能。</p>
<p>演員卡萊葛倫水平以上，伊瑟巴里特演戲不多。</p>
<p>沉淵</p>
<p>它和「寂寞芳心」一樣，太顧到氣氛而忘了戲，以至陷人沉悶的深淵，開幕和人物介紹甚佳</p>
<p>亂世劍俠</p>
<p>這部武俠片像看京戲的武戲似的，到末了來了一下大套開打，手脚乾凈，確為上選，前部除小范朋克扮珠寶商的一段尙佳外，餘均看不到賣力處。</p>
<p>怪屍案</p>
<p>沒有够上水凖，綫索也不够明晰，動作處理僅有末段兇手汽車夫脫逃，伏法一節尙可，吉士馬立斯心不從力，力不從心。</p>
<p>本週演員中蘭莤寶座為琪恩亞瑟所奪，次為卡萊葛倫。</p>
<p>（一）琪恩亞惡，在「紅塵三客」中。</p>
<p>（二）蘭茜，在「義大尋主」中。</p>
<p>（三）卡萊葛倫，在「紅塵三客」中。</p>
<p>（四）卡萊葛倫，在「直搗東京」中。</p>
<p>（五）考爾門，在「紅塵三客」中。</p>

<p>平克勞利貝旣沒有瀟酒飄逸的風姿，更不天生有一副令人喜悅的面龐，他的成名是不能與昔日的范崙鐵諾或約翰巴里摩亞相比的；他積多年的硏習，不斷的努力，而以眞才勝人的。當他在三十幾歲的時候，他才初露頭角，而起初在好萊塢亦僅在短片中做湊角而巳，可是他有奮鬥不懈的精神。一九三四年即已在好萊塢賣座最高明星中佔節七把座椅，至一九三七年則已升至第四位，至一九四門年時，他的聲譽是到最高峯了；該年他因主演「聖殿雄歌」（Coing　my　Way）而榮獲演按最佳的金像獎，同時亦因該片而雄據賣座最高的冠軍；一九四五年又連獲該項寶座，總計在最效十二年內，平克勞斯貝在美國賣座最高的十大明星中已有六次以上的紀錄，他自己的確是可以驕傲的了。</p>
<p>平克勞斯　在藝術上是成功了；而在銀幕下他却又是一個標準的丈夫，可敬的父親，他巳有四個男孩，夫人叫狄克賽（Dixie），他常常自認他一生中就祇有與狄克賽女士曾發生過羅曼斯；他不好二色在好萊塢是衆人皆知的，而他的太太呢亦眞可稱是一位賢內助，平在未婚前一度曾沉迷於賽馬等賭博中，自與狄克賽相識後即摒除惡習，一志專心於自己的事業上；倆人自結褵迄今已逾十二載，而仍相愛如漆，他們這一對眞是誰不羨慕呢？</p>
<p>自第二次世界大戰爆發後，平克勞斯貝的歌聲眞不知解救了多少人精神上的痛苦，聽了他的歌唱後我們會忘掉一切，心內會發生一種怡怡自樂的感覺，美國的輿論說平克勞斯貝的歌唱是不朽的，而全球人士亦將水遠不會有倦於聆聽他歌唱的一天。</p>

<h3>關於忠義之家</h3>
<p>— 吳林仁</p>
<p>這次「忠義之家」，在千萬人們的期待之下上演了。</p>
<p>每個人都感覺到有點興奮！每個人都相先賭為快！這是勝利後國產片的第一聲！「是，勝利後第一部國產巨片」！</p>
<p>看到銀幕上一幕幕動人演出，尤其在我們現在痛定思痛的時候，每個人都激動得要流淚了。軋戶口米，衝鐵絲網，飢餓，封鎖，我們都是身歷其境耳聞目睹的事，在今日回味到過奴隸日子的時候，我們依然有深切的餘痛！</p>
<p>假使說道是部描寫一門忠烈的愛國故事，毋寗說是一部偉大的叙事詩。讓我們把幾年來在鬼子的蹂躪和堅迫之下過着的生活，來一個詳細的申訴，讓千百萬中華人們的子孫。知進知道什麼才是他們「不願做奴隸的人們」的時候，讓許多許多的人們感覺到如何迫切地需要着光明與自由！</p>
<p>在演技與劇情方面我們感到親切而可愛，或許是我們看到了國產片的關係吧？當然，在片子的本身，還不能說是十分美滿，不過你能覺察到目前中國電影尙在幼年時代的話，却也不願苛責了。</p>
<p>筆者以最大誠意，希望從事電影業的人們多多地努力，中國的人民正在期待着你們的成就哩！</p>
<p>祝福你！中國電影。廣大的羣衆在向你招手！</p>

<h3>自慰</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「靈魂比劍更强」。</p>
<p>昨天接到一個同業來信，叙述他因肺病離開了崗位，為之惻然！在記者節前夕，眞不知是歡笑，是泣淚。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，新聞從業員的血汗經歷，思之慄然！其實，即在太平盛世，社會上也沒有一種職業比新聞記者更艱苦，緊張，矛盾，與不正常的了。這一說法，是包括了精神生活與物質生活的。據說，有一位新聞界前輩曾發誓他的女兒決不嫁給新聞記者。</p>
<p>然而還有若干人前仆後繼甘之如給願從事這一工作者，其道理即在培根上面的那句名言。</p>
<p>假使失去道一崇高的理想，人們最好還是去做做別的買賣，這要比白畫奔波，漏夜昏燈，要舒服得多。</p>
<p>今天記者節，我們安慰自已，也夜安慰未來的後繼者。</p>
<h3>記者節的誕生</h3>
<p>— 鋼果</p>
<p>記者有節，自民國二十三年始。這個佳節的誕生，和浙江省有一段關係。原來浙江省黨部在民國二十二年秋，呈請中央保護新聞從業員；國民政府於同年九月一日，准其所請，明令保護，杭州市新聞記者公會也號召國內新聞界，擬定九月一日那一天為「記者節」。</p>
<p>第一屆記者節於國府頒怖保護新聞記者令的週年紀念日舉行。不過那時候却並不十分轟動熱烈。全國新聞事業發皇的幾個都市，如上海，南京，漢口，廣州，香港等地，都沒有什麽表示。僅北平，太原，厦門，長沙，鎮江等地，響應杭州記者的發動，一致開會慶祝；各該地的新聞紙，並且都休刋一天，以資「小憇」。</p>
<p>我們的記者節，是浴着烽火生長的。自二十六年全面抗戰發生後，記者活躍在每一道前綫，在每一處後方與敵後。工作的緊張，責任的繁重，使我們意味着「自己的節日」在團結，合作，進取等方面的重要性；因此這一個偉大的節日就一年一年地慶祝得廣泛起來，「鬧猛」起來了。</p>
<p>到了三十三年的三月裏，政府又將這個令節予以核定。茲錄是年三月二十五日中央通訊社重慶電如下：</p>
<p>『九月一日記者節，雖已舉行有年，但未經政府公佈。頃悉業經社會部會同內政部呈奉行政院核定，並已轉飭各省市政府及各地新聞記者公會知照。』</p>
<p>三十三年國定首屆記者令節，在戰時首都的重慶，由中國新聞學會和重慶市各報聯合委員會協同主辦紀念會，假中宣部禮堂舉行，到會長官來賓及新聞界一百五十餘人，由新聞學會理事長蕭同茲主席。是日晚間，中央宣傳部為慰勞記者，舉行聯誼晚會，到各報記者及該部同志四〇七人。此次盛會，記者「皆大歡喜」。</p>
<p>這次大會，其實也就是戰都最後一次的記者盛集，因為等不到下一年的記者節，大戰就匆匆勝利結束了。三十四年的令節，大家是忙碌在「復員」中。</p>
<p>如上所術，上海在抗戰以前未曾熱烈地紀念過記者節；抗戰期間又因本地淪陷較早，租界亦因環境危險，不便作公開活動，每逢佳節，祇好遙寄心情，與內地同業共慶祝之。所以今天的上海記者們歡天喜地的祝賀自己的佳節，實在是自有「記者節」以來的第一遭。</p>
<h3>第一張報紙</h3>
<p>近代新開報紙的出現，起始於一五六六年意大利所發行的Notizis　Soritte（能·之烏）。·復印刷術發明，各國繼起發行，新聞報紙漸日形發達了。</p>
<p>英國第一張日報發行於一七〇二年，報名是Daily　Current。美國第一張報紙為一七〇四年波士頓之Newsletter。</p>
<p>日本的第一張報紙是明治三年在橫濱出版的「橫濱每日新聞」。</p>
<p>一八一五年第一張發行於海外的華文報紙，率由倫敦傳敎會創辦由英人瑪禮遜，麥都司和我國第一個耶穌敎徒粵人梁歪發編輯的「察世俗每日統計傳」。</p>
<p>我國純粹為國人資本，國人主編的報紙，要算同治十二年在漢口出版的「昭文新報」為最早。</p>
<p>現在報紙中，歷史最久的申報創始於同治十一年四月三十日（一八七二年）。當時係由英人美查F．Major所創。至民國元年始讓渡於史量才先生。</p>
<h3>多了四天</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>立夫先生妙語</p>
<p>三年前的記者節，陳立夫先生剛好到屯溪，當晚在馮有眞先生邀集的文化界歡迎陳先生的茶會上，陳氏衣夏布長衫，揮着摺誋，談笑風生，他說：「記者先生：記者是計會敎師。他比普通的為人師者還要難；你看敎師節是八月廿七日，而記者節却是九月一日，比敎師飾足足還要多了四天！」亦莊亦諧，意義深長，全場為之哄然。</p>
<h3>上海有多少報紙</h3>
<p>— 喬喬治</p>
<p>讓我告訴你：本市現有報紙，大大小小，包括外國文的在內，一共是四十三種。</p>
<p>這四十三種報紙當中，以國家界限來劃分，計；中文報三十四種；英文報四種，俄文報二種，日文，法文報各一種。</p>
<p>三十四種中文報之中，又可以分為：大型日報十九種，小型日報九種以及晚報六種。</p>
<p>上海動態</p>
<h3>取締馬路攤販</h3>
<p>— 昌年</p>
<p>走私美貨今起銷聲匿跡　限期太短攤販改業困難</p>
<p>眼前的上海街頭，攤販多似鱗次櫛比，氣象蓬勃，向所未有。全市的攤販商人，估計當在二萬五千人以上，他們販賣的貨物，五光十色，衣食用品，應有盡有。走到一條比較熱鬧點的街道，簡直就如走入了一家百貨公司。</p>
<p>但是，從今天（九月一日）起，除掉書報，零食和香颜攤以外，你將看不見其餘的攤子，因為市政府已在本月二十日下令取締。二十八日上午，全市攤販曾在溪口路集結了萬餘人的隊伍，向市政府請願，要求撤回成命或者延長期限，可是得不到結果。幾萬人的生計，便要發生問題。</p>
<p>本市設攤營業的興起，不過最近三四年來的事。它正是市面不景氣的反映，在敵偽盤據時期，生活的困貧達於極點，有胆力，氣力的便敞「單帮」生意，體弱畏苦的祇好在屋子附近設攤，靠小買賣度日，當時以捲烟有利可圖，因此曾有一個時期，上海街道上充斥了大大小小的香烟攤小皮箱。等到後來，捲烟無甚利潤，那些攤販却又改營別的買賣，銀元攤，糖果攤，糕點攤，……紛紛出現。一直到勝利來臨，那些小販為了謀職仍舊不容易，祇有幹老本行。起先買賣法幣偽幣的攤販會興旺過好多時候，他們目光銳利，祇顧謀收入的增益，見到美國貨價業物美，易於銷售，便藉此轉賣得利，收入很是不惡。最近為了「美貨攤」同業日多，為避免彼此競爭，大家蒙受損失，他們暗中成立組織，遇有美貨，集款承購，然後按股攤分，局外人無法問津。</p>
<p>為了開支較省，這些攤販手裏的東西，確實比商后中便宜，所以銷售容易，收入足够維持三兩口的生活。</p>
<p>攤販的蓬勃，是一種略形現象，如果任他們長期設立，不單有損市容，而且妨礙交通。所以，這一次市政府的毅然措置，是合理的。不過，我以為市政府在八月二十日，方才下令，而取締的期限，僅有短短的十日，叫他們改業，斷斷來不及，如果能够顧慮到事實，將時限略為寬延，政令的推行，一定可以毫無阻礙。</p>
<h3>光榮之頁</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>緬懷上海的殉難記者</p>
<p>欣逢記者節，無限感奮，因為這是我們自己的節日。但在感奮中，我們却永遠不能忘懷太平洋戰爭以前，為報人鬥爭史記載下「光榮之頁」的犧牲者。他們為了盡歷史的任務而走上十字架</p>
<p>張似旭的被殺—他是當時大美晚報的主持人，因為堅守報人崗位，迭次接獲汪逆的恐嚇信，種種卑劣的威脅，但他沒有屈服。為了職務上的關係，他必須不顧危險與外界保持連繫。捕房雖然派了一例密探隨時保護他，但他有時却不願意和密樑偕行，自駕汽車在路上疾駛。因為，他撫心自問坦白·眞誠·因而不計意外。</p>
<p>不幸，一天下午，張光生又自駕了汽車，到靜安寺路起士緻咖啡館，他拿着一本外國雜誌，躺在沙發在，正着得出神的時候，偽方的特務，已老早環繞在他的周圍，等他驀然發覺，搶蟬已雪片似的飛來，常塲即吿斃命，一個波蘭人激於正義，當塲抱住兇手，也犧牲了！</p>
<p>最勇敢的</p>
<p>朱惺公的慘死—朱先生是大美晚報夜光的主編人。廿八年六月，偽「特工總部」對各報編輯記者發出第一封恐嚇信，大意說：「如不改變態度，即缺席判決死刑」。先生接此信後，勇敢的公開答覆了一封信，那就是上海傳誦一時的『將被「國法」宣判「死刑者之自供』之一文。稍關心上海報業者，都能背育這篇文。</p>
<p>談文披露後，偽「特工」對朱先生痛恨入骨，置之死地而後甘。廿八年八月卅日下午四時，先生由北河南路家中外出，步行人館工作，途經河濱大厦附近，突有暴徒三人攔住去路，向其頭部射擊，立即倒地殞命。記得先生在答覆奸偽們的信中曾經有一段說：「余之頭顱，能得為無情之槍彈所貫，頭顱乃不得謂為無價，頭顱有價，死何憾乎」？讀了令人感泣！</p>
<p>程振章遇害—和先生是大美晚報國際版的編輯。據說，程先生一向宿於館中，平時異常謹愼，但因為平素事母極孝，每於不固定時間內，返家省視老母。他早具戒心，因而某日特地化裝工人模樣，偸偸地回家。詎知在次晨十時半，他剛自家裏外出，路旁早停了一輛汽車，看當時的情形，或許偽「特工」要綁架他到滬西去，然結果他中了三彈，頓時倒地，幸廣慈醫院近在咫尺，他即經送院醫治，但傷勢慘重，因而在第三天的黃昏，他與我們永別了！</p>
<p>最壯烈的</p>
<p>金華亭被刺—金先生是當時申報記者。他也早具戒心，常携自衛手槍出去，回館的時間不是夜深就是黎明。這時，他帮助中宣部馮有眞先生做工作，非常出力，無論局勢如何嚴重，仙總毫不畏懼的奔走。</p>
<p>他之被刺慘案發生在三十年二月三日。他在二日下午和三個同事從彈子房準備回報館，豈知行至中途，他忽然返身說要到一友人家去吃晚飯，並且吿訴同事，這友人極可靠，決無意外，大約十一時必定回來。</p>
<p>這夜他很平靜的過去了，但在次日黎明時，他行經愛多亞路世界汽車行的門首，預備僱汽車回報館時，偏巧車子都出差了，他一個人踽踽地徘徊在行人道上，等候車子回來。不料暴徒多人，早已埋伏，遂四面包圍，向他開搶亂擊。他雖身帶武器，但已揹手不及，身中四彈，壯烈地死去了　適逢佳節，偶然記者上面幾位壯烈同志，拉雜寫來，只是表示一些內心的欽佩和沉痛，並希望這種犧牲精神將永遠成為我輩報人的優良傳統！其實抗戰以後，在上海，在後方，殉難的新聞託者，偉大的無名英雄，許許多多，他們的事蹟，我們無法盡述，亦無法盡知，但他們的偉大，並不因紙上的頌場，而有所軒輊！</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Reorganizing the National Government Committee: Wu and Zhang Have Received Instructions; Chairman Advocates Expanding the Government Base</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Kuling, July 31st] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife visited the Chairman's office at 10:30 AM on the 31st. After a half-hour conversation, they were accompanied by the Chairman's wife to visit the Kuling Library. It is rumored that Special Envoy Marshall will return to Nanjing in a day or two, and some of his belongings have already been transported down the mountain.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Kuling, July 31st] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng went to the Chairman's office together at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 31st to receive instructions before participating in the five-person talks. The Chairman strongly advocated the speedy realization of expanding the government base. They left after an hour and then attended a joint meeting of the Central Affairs Supervisory Committee of the Youth League. In the afternoon, they visited Dai Chuanxian, Zhou Zhongyue, Luo Luying, and others to discuss the matter. They are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Kuling, July 31st] According to authoritative sources, the government representatives participating in the five-person talks have received instructions to negotiate with the Communist Party on the reorganization of the National Government Committee with sincerity and a peaceful attitude, so that one of the five major proposals of the Political Consultative Conference can be thoroughly studied and a perfect implementation method can be obtained.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Nanjing, July 31st] After Ambassador Stuart's flight from Nanjing to Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 31st, political activities in the capital became even more silent. The general public is currently expecting Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng to return to Nanjing so that the informal five-person meeting, which holds the key to peace, can be convened as soon as possible. On the Communist Party side, Zhou Enlai had no activities on the 31st, presumably preparing for the meeting. This reporter recently asked a foreign authoritative figure about the possible effects of the talks. He said: Judging from Zhou Enlai's attitude, just as the government hopes, he is also striving to achieve ideal results in this meeting, smoothly completing the reorganization of the National Government Committee, so as to further achieve the goal of reorganizing the government. However, the Communist Party delegation's spokesman's insistence on two preconditions is actually extremist propaganda. It is expected that after the official start of the meeting, it will gradually become clear.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing: Claims No Special Mission This Time; Hopes to Promote China's Democratic Politics Together</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] US Ambassador to China, Dr. Stuart, arrived in Shanghai by special plane at 10:20 AM yesterday, his first visit since taking office. US Embassy Army Attaché Barr and Naval Attaché Kaine, along with Lu Qixin, Chief Secretary of the Central Propaganda Department, arrived together. Those who went to Jiangwan Airport to welcome him included US Consul General in Shanghai Davis, Army Attaché Eden, and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce. On the Chinese side were Zhang Bide, a representative of Wu Chang, Gao Lingbai, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several alumni of Yenching University. The ambassador, wearing a navy blue suit and a felt hat, was all smiles and was immediately surrounded by well-wishers after disembarking. Some Yenching University alumni brought three children, who also stepped forward to shake hands with the ambassador. The ambassador leaned down to comfort them, repeatedly asking "How are you?" and then went to the US Consulate with Davis in the same car.</p>
<p>American Community Hosts Banquet</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, seventeen directors of the American Chamber of Commerce held a banquet to welcome the ambassador on the fifth floor of the American Club on Fuzhou Road. The ambassador changed into a white suit and arrived on time accompanied by Davis. Before entering the elevator, he posed for a photo at the request of this newspaper's reporter. The ambassador delivered an impromptu speech at the banquet, first saying: "I myself was more surprised than anyone else to be appointed as ambassador. I can only guarantee that I will first try my best to learn and then faithfully fulfill my duties. Currently, the main activity is naturally to strive to assist General Marshall's peace negotiations." Next, he said: "What the US government and people need for China is exactly what the Chinese people hope for, namely, national freedom and independence, domestic unity and peace, and the development of economic progress and construction. The only question now is how to achieve these clear goals." Finally, he said: "Although most of my personal efforts are currently focused on solving the Chinese peace issue, I will still do my best to protect the interests of American citizens here and throughout China."</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the US Information Office in the Hamilton Building was crowded with Chinese and foreign reporters. Those who arrived later had no seats and stood listening. The ambassador gave a brief speech and personally translated it into fluent and accurate Mandarin, roughly saying: "I have no news to offer on this trip to Shanghai, but because I deeply feel that newspapers are extremely powerful in promoting democratic politics, I am happy to meet with you all today. The establishment of a democratic system in China is the wish of the people of the whole country, and the government is also prepared to implement it. A democratic system is the best political system in the world, but it requires people to have considerable knowledge and know how to love their country. Otherwise, democracy will be an empty slogan. I have been in charge of Yenching University affairs for many years, founded the journalism department, and cultivated talents. I feel even more that at the beginning of the implementation of democratic politics, newspapers have a major mission. I hope to cooperate with you in the future to promote China's democratic politics." After the ambassador finished speaking, reporters raised three questions about the five-person group meeting, China's current economic situation, and the mission of the US military in North China. The ambassador predicted the future of the KMT-CPC negotiations, saying: "I hope there will be a satisfactory solution. The five-person group meeting is the first step to break the deadlock. Negotiations will begin this Monday." As for the current economic situation in China, he said that because he is not an economic expert, he cannot make a hasty conclusion, but the situation is indeed very bad. Finally, he said: "The purpose of the US Marine Corps' stay in North China is to repatriate Japanese nationals and temporarily protect the railway." The ambassador especially emphasized the word "temporary" because the interpreter did not translate the word "temporary," so the ambassador immediately repeated it and corrected it. This reception lasted only 20 minutes. At 6:00 PM, the American Association held a cocktail party at the Country Club to welcome the ambassador. The traffic on Columbia Road was heavy, and the scene was extremely grand.</p>
<p>Today (the 1st), Mayor Wu and his wife will host a banquet, and General Gillem will host a reception in the evening. The ambassador is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Army Authorities Decide to Establish Three Training Schools</h3>
<p>US Advisory Group Responsible for Guidance</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Nanjing, July 31st] In order to facilitate the training of the National Army, the Army authorities have decided to cooperate with the US Military Advisory Group to establish three training schools for infantry, field artillery, and armored units from October this year, training a large number of assistant instructors. The training in the above three schools is of a short-term nature, with each training session accommodating 100 people for a period of two months. The trainees are officers at the rank of captain and lieutenant, selected from outstanding personnel from various units. After completing the training, they will be assigned to various formal military schools to serve as assistant instructors. The US Advisory Group is responsible for the technical guidance and the necessary modern equipment for the three training schools.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Nanjing, July 31st] It is reported that there have been changes in the personnel of the US Military Advisory Group. Officers who have completed their terms of service have mostly returned to their country, and those who have come to replace them are mostly older career officers. There are many experts in armored warfare in the group. As for naval advisors, most of them work in Qingdao, and very few remain in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Appointments for Commanders of Various Garrison and Regiment Districts</h3>
<p>Only Sons Not Exempted from Military Service</p>

It is reported that senior personnel in each district are generally appointed by the central government, while mid- and lower-level cadres are selected from the Officers' General Corps, requiring approximately 30,000 people. According to the new conscription system, all able-bodied men of conscription age throughout the country, except those with disabilities (i.e., those without capacity for action), have an obligation to perform military service, and even only sons are not exempt. However, after entering the camp, all treatment will be more rationalized than in the past.</p>

<h3>National Army Concentrating in Chengde One After Another; Communist Army at Gubeikou Shaken; Tensions Simmering in the Eastern Front of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Shenyang, July 30th] Now that Chengde has been taken by the National Army, subsequent troops have been concentrating in Chengde one after another, and the Communist Army in Rehe Province is in a state of chaos. It is reported that the National Army is currently working hard to maintain railway transportation between Chengde and Gubeikou. The Communist Army at Gubeikou shows signs of wavering and is currently evacuating supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping, July 30th] Military news indicates that the Communist Army unit of Li Yunchang in Rehe has gradually expanded along the Beining Railway line since the middle of this month, attempting to destroy the railway and seize important strongholds along the line in order to cut off the connection between the National Army inside and outside the pass. The National Army stationed between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou, in order to ensure the safety of the Beining Railway and to eliminate the current threat from the Communist Army, was forced to launch a counterattack on the 24th, breaking through the strong resistance of the Communist Army along the way. On the 29th, the National Army on the southern route crossed the line from Yongping Qinglongtang Dahe to the south of Pingquan Heishan Ravine. On the northern route, after recovering Chengde on the 29th, part of the force has crossed Luanping and is only 70 kilometers away from the National Army stationed in the Shixia Town area of Miyun. It is expected that they will soon join forces. Another unit of the National Army is heading north from Chengde towards Longhua and is currently sweeping towards the Wenchang area.</p>
<p>[United Press dispatch from Tianjin, July 31st] The Communist Army is destroying the railway between Chengde and Gubeikou in order to cover their retreat.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Tianjin, July 31st] After the fall of Huoxian in the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, the National Army has automatically withdrawn from Lingshi.

<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Tianjin, July 31st] A unit of the Communist Army suddenly infiltrated Xigangtou in Shijiazhuang at 1:00 AM on the 30th. After a fierce street fight with the defending troops, they were finally driven out by the Shimen militia and retreated southwest.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, July 31st] According to a telegram from Jiangdu: The Communist Army is attacking Daxiao Baimi Town very urgently. According to reports, the situation in the town was unclear on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Jiangdu, July 31st] According to a telegram from Taixian, the Communist Army attacked Masu east of Jiangyan with two regiments yesterday. The National Army, with only one company defending the area, bravely resisted and defeated the Communist Army. In addition, small groups of the Communist Army are harassing the southwest of Shaobo Lake quite fiercely. The National Army has dispatched troops to suppress them. The front line of Yangzhou is calm. It is also learned that a military conference was held in Changzhou today to discuss the new actions of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Taixian, July 30th] There are no major changes in the eastern front. Both sides are frequently mobilizing troops, and tensions are simmering amid the calm. It is rumored that Hujiaji, west of Haian, has fallen into the hands of the Communist Army. The Communist Army has carried out large-scale massacres in Qutang and Baimi, stabbing all government officials to death with bayonets. The total number of victims is over a thousand, and the entire Qubai area is currently shrouded in red terror. In addition, according to reliable sources, a powerful unit of the National Army will arrive here to deal with this serious situation.</p>

<h3>Secret Communist Documents Found on a Captured Soldier; Instructs on Land Revolution and Operational Strategies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping, July 29th] Recently, the National Army found an important secret document on a captured Communist soldier in a certain area. It is a resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, instructing on future land revolution and comprehensive operational strategies. It is very clear. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently stipulated a general outline of current work in the liberated areas to adapt to the situation of the domestic war that is beginning.</p>
<p>(1) The Question of Consolidating Liberated Areas</p>
<p>(1) In order to enable the liberated areas to develop forward in a consolidated manner, the land revolution must be deepened and expanded, and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must have good unity, solid organization, and political determination. Especially at the beginning of the revolutionary war, it is necessary to be able to conduct large-scale positional warfare, to be able to defeat the Kuomintang's offensive, and to be able to concentrate the scattered liberated regimes and establish a national liberated regime. This requires striving for the following three most important conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Complete the full mobilization of the peasant masses to a sufficient degree.</p>
<p>(2) Vigorously implement the training of reserve armed forces in regular warfare.</p>
<p>(3) And further acquire cities with strategic significance on points and lines.</p>
<p>(2) In accordance with the above conditions, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China now determines that the Jin-Ji-Cha region, connected to the Yu-Lu-Su-Bei region, is a large region. To consolidate it and develop it into the central base of the liberated areas, we must use great strength and speed to establish it firmly.</p>
<p>(3) The general conditions for consolidating the base areas of the liberated areas are, first, to mobilize the basic masses in the rural areas, the poor peasants, hired laborers, and coolies, to gradually obtain the benefits of the land revolution, and to consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, and firmly oppose and suppress the development of the rich peasants. The most important strategy in this regard is to thoroughly redistribute land based on population and labor force as the standard, and strictly prohibit the rich peasants from expanding land based on production tools as the standard. We must be very cautious not to infringe upon the interests of the middle peasants. In the current liberated areas, there are still obstacles on the path of the rich peasants, taking advantage of the opportunity of equal distribution of land to seize the benefits of the land revolution. On the other hand, in many areas, there are errors in the wrong strategies of killing rich peasants and shaking middle peasants. These are the most important dangers hindering the consolidation of the liberated areas. First, it is necessary to resolutely and quickly eliminate the organizations of all reactionary forces in the liberated areas and their armed forces. It is necessary to exclude the rich peasant elements from the political power and all armed organizations. It is necessary to attract the masses of bandits and vagrants, so that they can obtain the benefits of the land revolution. The best way is to dissolve their inherent organizations, allocate them with corresponding land, and resolve their reactionary leaders. Even the leaders who sympathize with the revolution cannot be allowed to lead the original masses. Second, it is necessary to establish a truly broad liberated area regime managed by the workers, peasants, and laborers themselves. In places where the liberated area regime has been established, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to implement re-elections. The most important thing in the political power is to establish strong proletarian leadership and resolutely implement all the laws and regulations promulgated by the border area government. Third, it is necessary to establish a "iron army" of pure worker-peasant composition in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the training of the reserve army. Here, centralized and unified military command becomes a prerequisite. Fourth, in carrying out the task of consolidating the liberated areas, it is necessary to oppose "isolationism," "peaceful conservatism," and "evading the mountains," etc. It is necessary to oppose the suicidal policy of "cutting off territory and defending oneself" and not developing outward. In particular, it is necessary to oppose "circling" and "guerrilla" development.</p>
<p>(4) In the sense of consolidating the liberated areas, all cities within the liberated areas should be completely occupied. Of course, in tactics, especially in mobilizing the masses, some larger cities may not be occupied all at once, but the Kuomintang must not be allowed to continue to rule in some important cities in the Jin-Ji-Cha-Yu-Lu liberated areas, and to direct reactionary armed forces to attack the liberated areas. For example, the main reason why Suiyuan-Baotou, Datong on the Ping-Sui Railway, Pingding-Baoding, Shijiazhuang on the Ping-Han Railway, Cangzhou-Jinan, Taian, Xuzhou on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and Tangshan-Yuhuan on the Beining Railway have been occupied by the Kuomintang for a long time is that the entire transportation artery has not been cut off by us, so the Kuomintang can transport weapons and equipment and drive straight in. This makes the interior of the liberated areas constantly at risk of being harassed by them, and we have no rear to defend when we go out to fight. However, occupying and consolidating all the cities inside the liberated areas is by no means effective by simply attacking and defending this city. On the contrary, occupying this city, if it is necessary to rely on mobilizing the broad masses of peasants around to besiege it, and to rely on intensifying the work in the city to respond to it, then consolidating this city will depend more on promoting the mobilization of the masses around it, intensifying the self-defense work of the masses in the city and countryside, and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which defend the democratic regime, must develop outward, cutting off all transportation of the Kuomintang, and coercing them so that they cannot invade the liberated areas. Only in this way can the liberated areas be consolidated. In summary, the interior of the liberated areas must not allow the existence of the Kuomintang's forces at all, even large cities with political significance such as Ping, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Jinan cannot be allowed to continue to exist. We must resolutely and systematically use the power of mobilizing the masses and combine it with military action to completely defeat the Kuomintang forces within the liberated areas. Of course, this does not mean that the Kuomintang's forces will never invade again, but this consolidation is a prerequisite that must be possessed at the beginning of the domestic revolutionary war.</p>
<p>(2) Strategy and Tactics of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army</p>
<p>(1) At present, the operational strategy of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must be based on the national political situation and the Party's political guidelines in the liberated areas. Now the Kuomintang is taking advantage of the ceasefire to prepare for a large-scale civil war, so it can transfer several divisions of troops from South China to attack the liberated areas. Therefore, the recent strengthening of the Kuomintang army in the five provinces of Jin-Ji-Cha-Yu-Lu to attack the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army does have a considerable possibility of realization. Here, we must clearly recognize that in order to defeat the Kuomintang's offensive, in order to prevent the liberated areas from being destroyed by them, and to develop forward in a consolidated manner, we can only resolutely and quickly carry out the plan to defend the liberated areas from both inside and outside. The Party should mobilize the masses outside the liberated areas to defend the liberated areas and destroy the Kuomintang army's attempt to attack, which will not be discussed here. But within the liberated areas, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate all armed forces of the Kuomintang and mobilize the masses for self-defense, so that the Kuomintang will not dare to send troops deep into the liberated areas in the first place. The operational strategy of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must adopt an offensive posture to suppress the Kuomintang's invasion. From this point of view, we should first attack the cities on the points and lines with an offensive posture, coercing the Kuomintang army to retreat to areas that do not hinder the development of the liberated areas. In this way, the liberated areas can not only be consolidated, but also developed outward, and only in this way can the consolidation of the liberated areas be guaranteed, and the Kuomintang's offensive plan can encounter a major failure. This is the general guideline for dealing with the current Kuomintang offensive, but two points must be added: (The following text continues on the second page)</p>
<h3>Sale of Civilian Surplus Goods: China and the United States Sign Agreement Yesterday; President Song and Mr. MacBride Issue Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency dispatch from this city] Premier Song of the Executive Yuan and Mr. MacBride, Director of the US Foreign Liquidation Commission and Special Assistant to the Secretary of State, jointly announced yesterday the signing of a general agreement between the United States and the Chinese government for the sale of a large number of civilian surplus goods in the Western Pacific and China. This sale is used to offset the cost of national currency owed by the United States in China and other appropriations equivalent to US$55 million.</p>
<h3>US Uses Surplus Goods to Offset Expenses in China</h3>
<p>The original cost to the US government of these surplus goods was US$500 million, scattered among China, Okinawa, Guam, Saipan, and other islands as mobile goods, and US$85 million in fixed equipment within China. In addition, another US$130 million in surplus goods can be used to offset the US$74 million owed by the United States. There are also smaller ships costing US$90 million and surplus goods stored in the western part of the country costing US$20 million.</p>
<p>In order to quickly complete the repairs and shipment of these goods, both parties agreed to establish a reserve of US$30 million specifically for chartering, paying technicians, and purchasing parts. This reserve will also be offset under the national currency owed by the United States. The reason for the United States government's arrears is the expense of the American motorcade in the Shanxi during the United States' war against Japan.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned arrears, the United States government obtained a value equivalent to US$35 million due to the establishment of consulates in China and other national currency expenses. To promote educational and cultural exchanges between China and the United States, China plans to spend national currency equivalent to US$20 million, which will also be offset under this surplus goods project.</p>
<h3>Helping Our Economic Recovery; Developing Trade Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>The surplus goods obtained by China are very suitable for economic recovery, so they will have a great impact on resisting the progress of inflation. Because this type of goods is in great demand in the market, its sale will provide a huge subsidy to the national treasury. However, these goods do not include aircraft, munitions, weapons, or any military supplies that have not been converted for civilian use.</p>
<p>On the US side, due to the conclusion of this agreement, the demobilization of the military and the liquidation of goods in the Pacific region will be accelerated. Moreover, after the Chinese market obtains these goods, it will be able to increase its strength to develop trade between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan will be responsible for handling these goods and will entrust several American engineering companies to assist in all handling affairs. When selling these goods, existing commercial channels will be utilized as much as possible. As for American merchants operating in China, they will have absolutely equal opportunities to underwrite these goods. For trademarked goods, the original managers will be handled as much as possible within the possible scope, and all customary sales methods will be used.</p>
<h3>Transportation of These Goods to Be Completed Within 22 Months</h3>
<p>China will complete the transportation of these goods within 22 months. In addition to financial assistance, the utmost cooperation of the US military in the Pacific bases will be obtained during the transportation of these goods to complete this task.</p>
<p>China will begin importing these surplus goods in the near future, and a significant portion should be transported by the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Important Speech by Government Representative Cai Wenzhi of the Military Mediation Department: The Chinese Communists Have in Fact Fully Mobilized for War</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] General Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff on the government side of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, accompanied by Major Staff Officer Lu Binglin, flew to this city from Peiping on the 28th of last month aboard a special plane of the Executive Headquarters. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., he made a special visit to General He Yingqin's residence to give the press corps of this city the following account of his views on the current situation: Regarding the current situation, the August 14th message from the Chairman and Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department's previous talks serve as guidelines for the work of the Mediation Department. I am not in a position to make further remarks. However, regarding the current general public opinion at home and abroad, and the confusing situation created by the Chinese Communist propaganda war, I would like to clarify the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese Communists announced a mobilization order on August 19th, and then denied it the next day. In fact, since the beginning of August, the Chinese Communists have mobilized all their forces to attack the government army. Their full-scale offensive is that Chen Yi's troops in Shandong and Jiangsu have concentrated their forces to attack northern Jiangsu; Liu Bocheng's troops in northern Henan and eastern Shanxi have concentrated their forces to attack the Chen Hailu Railway; He Long in Shanxi, Nie Rongzhen in Zhangjiakou, Yao Zhe in Suiyuan, and Xiao Ke in Rehe, all four units have concentrated on besieging Datong; and Chen Geng's troops in southeastern Shanxi have attacked Hongdong, Yuecheng, and Linfen south of Taiyuan. All the above-mentioned troops in North and Central China have been fully mobilized for combat. Only Lin Biao's troops in the Northeast have not launched an offensive because they were defeated in the Siping Street battle and are now reorganizing. Regardless of whether the Chinese Communists deny mobilization or announce mobilization, they have in fact fully mobilized to attack the government. Everyone should recognize this and not be misled by propaganda.</p>
<p>(2) The government is preparing to reorganize, convene the National Assembly, gather public opinion, review the constitution, and prepare to implement constitutional government. If the Chinese Communist's communism and its bloody terror policies are supported by the people, it can obtain its legal status when the government is reorganized. It should not openly announce mobilization and attack the government while the government is preparing to implement constitutional government and negotiate with it. This is not a dispute between political parties, but the launching of an internal rebellion by force, causing the people who have suffered from the war for eight years to suffer again from the ravages of war and economic hardship, and destroying the international glory achieved by eight years of sacrifice in one fell swoop, and being despised by the world. This kind of right and wrong, obedience and disobedience, should be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>(3) The crux of the situation lies in fundamentally different viewpoints: (1) The Chinese Communist Party's doctrine contains no nationalism, so its own interests outweigh the interests of the nation and the people; (2) The Chinese Communist Party attacks the government for being undemocratic, only believing that its land revolution, terror, bloody class struggle, and worker-peasant dictatorship are democracy; (3) The government hopes that everything can be resolved through consultation, so it must implement the military reorganization agreement to nationalize the army and not use force as a tool for political struggle, while the Chinese Communists do not implement the military reorganization agreement, but openly announce mobilization and attack the government while negotiating, and maintain their communist political form in their separatist areas by force. Is this a conspiracy to participate in the government on one hand, creating two governments within one government to subvert it, and on the other hand, to use force to create two countries within one country; (4) The government demands the restoration of transportation so that materials can circulate and the economy can recover. The Chinese Communists destroy railways, making the people even poorer. The government leases American materials and purchases American surplus materials so that the people who lack materials after the war can gradually restore their economic lives. The Chinese Communists do the opposite, so that everyone in China is impoverished, so that they can communize them; (5) The government prays for unity, stability, and construction day and night, so that this economically backward country does not lose the opportunity to build the country. The Chinese Communists create disturbances, destruction, and terror, so that their policies can be completed. If the above fundamental differences in views take the nation and the people as the premise, everything can be easily solved; otherwise, it is just a means for the Chinese Communists to implement their policies.</p>
<p>After General Cai finished speaking, reporters from this newspaper asked several questions, and he answered them one by one: (1) The Anping Incident is currently being investigated by the 25th Executive Group. However, difficulties have arisen because the Chinese Communists refuse to recognize the documents submitted by the people in the government areas; (2) Execution said; (3) Zaozhuang has already fallen into the hands of the Chinese Communists, and the executive group there only has American representatives. General Cai then told reporters in a firm tone: The Communist army is now concentrating all its efforts on invading the Longhai Line and northern Jiangsu, and has no strength to harass Peiping and Tianjin, so the security of Peiping and Tianjin can be guaranteed without worry. General Cai is scheduled to fly to Nanjing in three days to report to the Ministry of National Defense on the work of the electrical affairs mediation office in the past few months. He will stay in Nanjing for three or four days, and then return to Peiping.</p>

<h3>Secret Documents of the Chinese Communist Party Continued from the First Page</h3>
<p>First, this strategy can only be effective if all units act in unison under unified command and on the basis of mutual cooperation. The abandonment of Changchun in the past contained some elements of each unit taking care of itself. In the current process of the Kuomintang army attacking us, if we cannot overcome this phenomenon, we will only give the Kuomintang the convenience of defeating us one by one. Here we must point out the mistakes and losses of the past when each unit of the National Army could not act in unison. Second, this strategy is by no means an adventurous policy, but it must be based on mobilizing and expanding the armed masses to put pressure on the Kuomintang army's formation and intensifying the disintegration work within the Kuomintang army as the main strategy, and then using our main force to attack their weaknesses. In this way, they will inevitably collapse, and the vast masses of soldiers will inevitably turn to us. The previous experience of capturing Gui Sui clearly teaches us that the most important shortcoming in military affairs is that we are not prepared for large-scale warfare, military command cannot be concentrated, and actions cannot be consistent. What is particularly serious is that there is no work of ours among the soldiers of the Kuomintang army, especially in their main combat units, so the soldiers who have been shaken cannot immediately contact us. This is such a great loss.</p>
<p>2. Although there are still many weaknesses in the current offensive of the Kuomintang army, the overall situation has indeed gradually turned from defense to offense. Therefore, now we must quickly force them back to the position of counter-offensive and defense. In their current mobilization, there are still many troops that cannot be transferred at once, and those that are transferred are not all joining the front line to attack us at once. There are still many conflicts and hesitations among them over competing for territory or fearing the loss of territory. In particular, the soldiers in the Kuomintang army are tired of war and their wavering mentality towards us is enough to reduce the momentum of their offensive. We must seize these weaknesses and target them to quickly implement the strategy of suppressing their offensive. We must not wait, waiting is letting them gain the upper hand. We must not retreat, retreating is just a dead end. We must not defend a place alone, defending a place alone is giving them the opportunity to encircle us. We must not engage in circle-style guerrilla warfare again, circle-style guerrilla warfare will leave us without a rear, without a position, and even lose all base areas. Our correct tactics are to mobilize the broadest armed masses in the large-scale operations of the group army as the main force and launch the broadest guerrilla warfare in front of, behind, to the left, and to the right of their army to exhaust them, cut off all transportation and transportation to besiege them, and send capable members from the workers and peasants, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, especially the captured soldiers, to their army to carry out vigorous agitation to shake their military morale. This will be conducive to our offensive and to carry out separate and destroy attacks on them. Therefore, in the liberated areas, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must concentrate their fire to deal with the main right-leaning danger. At present, all decentralized policies, mountain-topism, and circle-style guerrilla escape concepts are very likely to revive. At the same time, left-leaning policies of no contact, no coordination, reckless advancement, and opposition to concentrated and unified scattered actions are equally giving the Kuomintang the opportunity to defeat us one by one. The party and the army in the liberated areas must fight against them with an extremely firm Bolshevik attitude. This is the only way to ensure that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army can answer the Kuomintang's offensive under unified action and centralized command and defeat their main force.</p>

<h3>Self-Reflection of Chinese Journalists</h3>
<p>Today is the second Journalists' Day since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. On this day last year, when the world was celebrating the victory, especially in Shanghai, which had been occupied for a long time and had just been liberated, the significance of Journalists' Day may not have been fully realized. But today, a year later, we are once again celebrating this happy festival, reminiscing about the past and looking forward to the future. Journalists' Day is our own festival, and it is indeed the best opportunity for us to reflect on ourselves. Today, as we celebrate this festival, we must not only celebrate enthusiastically, but also reflect on ourselves, encourage ourselves, and actively take on the task of reforming the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>Before the war, China's news industry was known to be backward. Whether in terms of content or technology, it was far behind the advanced newspaper industries of other countries. But during the Anti-Japanese War, after eight years of arduous efforts, it made considerable progress. On the surface, due to the lack of material conditions, Chinese newspapers could not fully express the characteristics of modern newspapers; but in terms of content, they were able to fulfill the tasks of modern newspapers in politics, economy, society, and culture. Not only could they lead public opinion and serve as the mouthpiece of the people, but they could also report accurate news in the fastest way possible, becoming an indispensable spiritual food for the people. They also played a great role in promoting national policies and maintaining morale. Especially the journalists in the occupied areas, despite the enemy's inducement and threats, were able to stand in their positions and fulfill their tasks of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens. Apart from a few scoundrels who shamelessly served the enemy, acted as accomplices, occupied newspaper offices, and flattered the enemy, the heroic stories of journalists worth singing and crying about, such as Mr. Zhu Xinggong, are too numerous to mention, which proves that most Chinese journalists have the spirit of a great man who "cannot be corrupted by wealth, cannot be moved by poverty, and cannot be subdued by force," which can add to the history of the country. In addition to celebrating today, the Shanghai Journalists Association has specifically decided to hold a memorial service for the martyrs of the Shanghai press who died in the Anti-Japanese War tomorrow morning, which has profound significance.</p>
<p>But while explaining the various advantages and characteristics, the Chinese news industry still cannot hide its internal defects. We cannot deny that the Chinese news industry is still backward.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of the world's newspaper industry, there are clearly two trends: externally, all countries are demanding international freedom of the press; internally, they are demanding freedom of speech. Because after the painful lessons of this war, the intellectuals of all countries believe that the root of this war was buried in the secrecy and disguise of international news before the war. If we want to create world peace in the future and hope that it can be maintained for a long time, we must seek freedom of international news. As long as they are current journalists, they can freely interview news in any country in the world, without any restrictions, freely transmit news, without local censorship, and freely publish news, without any interference. This epoch-making international movement has been joined by most countries except the Soviet Union. At the same time, peace-loving people generally believe that if the post-war world is to enter a new era of peace and democracy, freedom of speech in each country is also an indispensable condition. Freedom of speech is the life of democratic politics; without freedom of speech, there is no democracy. Political facilities that do not allow people to freely express their opinions will not make progress. Therefore, the people of all countries after the war are demanding freedom of speech. China has been stimulated by international trends and is moving towards this goal.</p>
<p>After a year of efforts by Chinese journalists, considerable achievements have been made in both the international freedom of the press movement and domestic freedom of speech. However, the current situation is still not entirely satisfactory. First, the number of reporters from Chinese newspapers and news agencies stationed abroad is limited, and the equipment for transmitting news is even more inferior. In the world's major cities, such as Washington, London, Paris, and Moscow, there is not even a direct reporting radio station. Therefore, although China has joined the international freedom of the press movement, it is not Chinese journalists who actually enjoy this freedom. Second, although the government has repeatedly ordered local governments to respect and protect domestic freedom of speech, and the government has also abolished the newspaper censorship system, cases of newspapers being destroyed and journalists being beaten, and even falsely using power and arbitrarily arresting people, are still common, and there have been such illegal incidents in Hangzhou recently. On Journalists' Day, we cannot but feel deeply regret and cannot but lodge a serious protest.</p>
<p>But then again. Although we journalists are known as "uncrowned emperors," we are not emperors who are the only ones to be respected. We want freedom, but we also have to abide by the law. Freedom is by no means a matter of breaking through fences and doing whatever we want. The more people who respect the freedom of others, the more people who can fully enjoy freedom. Journalists are no exception. We must reflect on ourselves: Is there any untruth in reporting the news? Is there any bias in expressing our opinions? Can politics be improved by our discussions? Will society become more decadent because of our news? Our pen is not only related to the honor and disgrace of the current country and the safety of the world, but also has an impact that can almost be said to affect the fate of mankind for decades, centuries, and even centuries, and is in the hands of journalists. Democratic countries attach importance to public opinion, and the general trend of politics is guided by public opinion. It can be seen that the more democratic a country is, the more journalists must cherish their pen. As we celebrate this festival, we deeply cherish the warning that "one word can make a country prosper, and one word can ruin a country." At the beginning of nation-building, cherish it, cherish it!</p>
<h3>Strange! The Chinese Communists' All-Out War</h3>
<p>What we like to hear most is the call for an "unconditional ceasefire"; what we fear to see most is the strategy of "all-out war." With the intention of all-out war, one will never be willing to unconditionally cease fire; if one has the sincerity of unconditionally ceasing fire, one will no longer be interested in planning the strategy of all-out war. However, these two things that cannot coexist, the Chinese Communist Party actually has both, is it not strange?</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Peiping reported that the secret instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were found in the captured Communist army. The full text is published in today's newspaper. A hurried glance cannot be discussed in detail, but one point that everyone feels is that this secret document, which is the strategy of office, is full of the smell of gunpowder. On the one hand, it said, "We must be able to deeply expand the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army," "We must be able to have positions to carry out large-scale operations," "We must be able to...establish a national liberation regime"; on the other hand, it said, "Vigorously implement the training of reserve armed regular warfare," "Acquire cities with strategic situations on points and lines," "Determine that the Jin-Ji-Cha area is connected to northern Yu-Lu-Su to form a large area,...becoming the central base area of the liberated area." These all fully show that the Chinese Communists were indeed prepared to fight a big war and kill a lot; it is a pity that they were still able to shout peace and unconditionally cease fire on the surface!</p>
<p>What is most noteworthy is that we used to think that the Chinese Communists at most wanted to possess troops and divide China, using this "capital" to participate in the central government, but unexpectedly, in this document, the Chinese Communists have bluntly pointed out the road to seize power. It opposes "remaining in a corner," opposes "drawing boundaries and guarding itself," and opposes "hiding in the mountains"; it no longer allows Suiyuan, Baotou, Datong, Peiping, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Jinan, Taian, Xuzhou, Tangshan, and Yuguan to remain in the hands of the National Army. In other words, the Chinese Communists are no longer satisfied with local separatism in a corner today, but believe that in the process of negotiating a ceasefire, they can mobilize the so-called broad masses of peasants to seize the entire political power of China. This truly deserves to be called a strategy of "all-out war"!</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart said yesterday at a reception for reporters in Shanghai that "a people's livelihood polity must be supported by good people," which can be said to be a pointed remark. Unfortunately, although China has good people today, the Communist Party, which sings peace but harbors war, is lying in the middle, and is deliberately trying to seize power by force. This is the fatal wound to the future of China's democratic politics. Although Ambassador Stuart has a full of enthusiasm and hopes to talk about the reorganization of the National Government first, and then other things, in order to seek a peaceful solution, I wonder if he will be able to fulfill his wish under the Chinese Communists' strategy of all-out war?</p>
<h3>From Rationing to Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>After the victory, all price control laws were abolished. However, because of the continuous rise in prices, the threat to the national economy and the people's livelihood was too great, so various rationing methods were successively implemented. The first to be implemented were foreign exchange and gold, followed by coal and rice, then oil and sugar, and recently cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Although these rationing methods may not be entirely satisfactory in theory, they have undoubtedly achieved considerable results in suppressing prices and cracking down on speculation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, yarn prices rose again, and the black market for oil and sugar has also been rampant recently. Some people are very skeptical about whether this method can stabilize prices at all. We believe that, generally speaking, before price controls can be effectively implemented, the various rationing measures mentioned above cannot but be said to be a good emergency remedy. Moreover, when all materials cannot be fully grasped, there is really no other more comprehensive countermeasure than trying to ration them.</p>
<p>That being said, we believe that there are indeed many areas where the implementation plan should be improved. At the very least, the price fluctuations of all rationed goods must be firmly controlled and not shifted to the black market. All semi-public or fully public black markets, even if they cannot be completely eliminated, must be suppressed so that they cannot be openly unscrupulous, reduce the effectiveness of rationing, and even disrupt the rationing market. As it stands now, these situations of taking advantage of the opportunity to profit and disrupt prices are really too rampant.</p>
<p>We know that for any method to be fully effective, it must have the cooperation of all parties. Therefore, government-run rationing requires the sincere cooperation of the public; and commercial rationing also requires the full assistance of the government. Insufficient external assistance will inevitably affect the operation itself; too many shortcomings in the operation itself will also make it impossible to achieve the expected goals. The rationing of cotton yarn is like this, and other rationing measures are no different.</p>
<p>The main driving force behind this cotton yarn rationing is clearly the private manufacturers. In terms of rationing, it can be called an innovation. We hope that all parties will give it practical support, and we also hope that it will continue to improve itself and truly stabilize yarn prices, and that the black market will not continue to be rampant!</p>

<h3>Philippine Authorities Determined to Quell Internal Strife; Large-Scale War Erupts; Deadline Expires for Disarmament of Farmer Guerrillas</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 31st] Large-scale warfare erupted in central Luzon today, and it is poised to become an open civil war. Constabulary forces have used artillery in several locations to bombard farmer anti-Japanese guerrillas. The government's deadline for surrendering arms expires this Sunday, and a peaceful resolution is now hopeless. The statements and actions of government leaders are quite firm. The constabulary will move out on Sunday to search for guns, and those who hide them will be killed without pardon. Nueva Ecija Governor Belmonte declared to a public gathering that the Republican government will use aircraft, tanks, artillery, and bombs to quell the rebellion starting in September. The constabulary headquarters announced that large-scale battles will occur in several locations in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan provinces. The constabulary used artillery to bombard the concentration points of farmer anti-Japanese guerrillas. The guerrillas retaliated with machine guns but were ultimately scattered. The kidnapping of farmer leader Fan Li has aroused suspicion among the farmers, and senior leaders such as Lu Ke have flocked to avoid following in his footsteps. It is said that as long as the civilian self-defense forces are armed, the farmer anti-Japanese guerrillas will not surrender their arms. The government has decided to re-establish the civilian self-defense forces and re-arm them, which is the biggest obstacle to a peaceful solution to the farmer problem. According to the Minister of the Interior, not only in central Luzon but throughout the island, the civilian self-defense forces will be given appropriate weapons to help maintain law and order. The so-called "armed peace" means that the more armed forces the government has, the more likely its policies will succeed, and illegal elements will think twice before making trouble.</p>
<h3>Molotov Returns Home Yesterday; Bevin Scheduled to Return to London Tomorrow; Treaty Review Work Intensifying</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 31st Emergency Broadcast: Molotov returned to Moscow from Paris tonight. British Foreign Secretary Bevin is also scheduled to return to London next Monday.</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse: The Economic Commission on Italy of the peace conference held a meeting on the 30th and resolved to follow the plan of the four foreign ministers' conference that Italy should compensate the Soviet Union US$100 million. Representatives of the four countries China, Britain, the United States, and France supported the Soviet proposal, which was finally passed by 15 votes to 5. Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa voted against it. This resolution was included in Articles 64, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the treaty.</p>
<p>Paris, 31st Broadcast: The Military Commission today reviewed Articles 42 and 44 of the military treaty with Italy. The Soviet Union argued that Italy could continue its scientific research work unless it was of a military nature. The Belgian amendment proposal was similar to that proposed by the Soviet Union, so it was automatically withdrawn. Article 44 was then passed. Article 42 concerned the demilitarization of islands such as Pantelleria, Lampedusa, Pelagosa, and Pianosa, which was passed in minutes. Article 45 forbade Italy from using combat materials, including those made in Germany and Japan, which was also passed immediately.</p>
<h3>100 Million Sparrows Transferred from Northeast China to Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese People Both Worried and Delighted</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] In recent weeks, about 100 million sparrows have migrated from Northeast China to Japan. The Tokyo authorities are quite pleased, but also somewhat worried, because sparrows can also consume a large amount of rice. Bird net merchants in Nagoya have now received a large number of orders, and these bird nets will be distributed to rural areas for capture when harvesting begins at the end of next month.</p>
<h3>Hungarian-Romanian Border Issue; Listening to Opinions of Both Countries</h3>
<p>According to United Press, the Romanian-Hungarian Political and Territorial Commission of the peace conference will hold a joint meeting at 4 p.m. on the 31st to listen to the opinions of representatives from Romania and Hungary on the case of assigning Outer Transylvania to Romania. It is expected that Hungary will not oppose returning Outer Transylvania to Romania but may propose moving the currently planned border eastward so that the sovereignty of the local Hungarians can still be retained. Romania may insist that all of Outer Transylvania should be under its rule.</p>
<p>The Balkan and Finnish Economic Commission unanimously passed the four-power proposal on the 31st that Romania should compensate the Soviet Union US$300 million. The South African amendment proposal for forcing Romania to provide "appropriate compensation" will be discussed at a later date.</p>
<h3>France Will Merge Northern Half of Germany into Rhineland State</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 30th] French occupation zone commander Koenig announced today to the Allied Control Council for Germany that the northern half of the French military occupation zone in Germany has been merged into a state, which will be named "Rhineland State." The government is located in Metz, and its administrative institutions will move there as soon as possible. Soviet representative Salowski of the Control Council commented on the matter, saying that it is incomprehensible why other countries want to change the German administrative structure so urgently before the foreign ministers' conference discusses the German issue.</p>
<h3>Chinese Representative Selected for Five-Power Telecommunications Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Five-Power Telecommunications Preparatory Meeting will be held in Moscow on the 28th of next month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to send Chen Zongxi, director of the Confidential Office, to participate.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] The State Department announced today that the United States has accepted the Soviet invitation to participate in the telecommunications conference to be held in Moscow.

<h3>US Naval Training Class in Universities; Hoover Gives Warning Speech; Unprecedented Danger in American History Currently Occurring on Islands in the Pacific</h3>
<p>[United Press, Palo Alto, California, 30th] Former President Hoover delivered a speech today to 160 graduates of the first class of the Naval Administration Training Program at Stanford University, saying that an unprecedented danger in American history is occurring on the islands in the Pacific. Hoover did not specify what the danger was, only saying that we must expand our defenses, so we must hold onto the islands. We cannot be accused of imperialism because we are not concerned about the commercial interests of the islands. We are only concerned with our own defense and the defense of the world. These naval officers will be assigned to Guam, Saipan, Samoa, Truk, Kwajalein, and Palau. Hoover hoped they would not encounter war in their new places of service.</p>
<h3>Ukrainian Complaint Against Greece Postponed by Security Council; Soviet Representatives Fail Twice; Further Action on Anglo-American Psychological Warfare Imminent</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] The Security Council met on the 30th to discuss the Ukrainian complaint against Greece. British and Soviet representatives engaged in another fierce debate. According to United Press International, Soviet representative Gromyko argued for inviting Ukrainian representatives to attend and state their reasons. British representative Alexander strongly opposed this. After several hours of discussion, the chairman announced that the matter would be put to a vote. As a result, the Soviet proposal only received the support of Brazil, Australia, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Poland, and therefore did not pass. According to the rules of the Security Council, a resolution must have seven votes to pass. The Soviet Union's eagerness to immediately discuss this case was because Greece will hold a plebiscite today (September 1), which could give it a serious blow, but now that it has been rejected, the case will be postponed until the next meeting. The next meeting will be held on September 3, after the Greek election has passed. The British representative has succeeded in gaining time, and the Soviet representatives' tricks have ultimately failed. Regarding Soviet representative Gromyko's previous proposal to the meeting, requesting that the United Nations provide detailed reports on the circumstances of its troop deployments in territories outside enemy countries, it caused a great uproar in the Security Council, the repercussions of which have not subsided even this morning. The general impression here is that the Soviet representative suddenly raised this case when the other representatives were unprepared, which may be a strategy, almost a part of the Soviet psychological warfare strategy. This Soviet action is an implication that the Soviet Union is preparing to take further action. At the beginning of this year, when the Security Council discussed the Iranian issue, Britain and the United States accused the Soviet Union of illegally stationing troops in Iran, while the Soviet Union strongly argued that the stationing of troops had been approved by the Iranian government. Now that the Soviet Union is blaming Britain and the United States for the Greek issue and the issue of foreign troops, Britain and the United States can cite previous examples to defend themselves. In short, the political divide between the Western bloc and the Soviet bloc is growing deeper and deeper, and there is no sign of any rapprochement in the short term.</p>
<h3>US Opposes Communist Seizure of Power</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 30th] The United States tonight delivered a notice to the Soviet Union stating that the United States will oppose the communist seizure of power in Korea and that US troops will remain in Korea until a representative government is established in that country.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 30th] The United States has apparently abandoned hope of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union to unify the northern and southern occupation zones of Korea. The State Department announced today that it intends to take various steps to promote democracy and autonomy in the US-occupied zone in the south.</p>
<h3>Nuremberg Tribunal Trials End; Nazi War Criminals Make Final Appeals; Secret Court to Discuss Verdict in Late September</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] The Nuremberg International Military Tribunal's trial of German war criminals has lasted for nine months and ended last night (August 31). Twenty-one leading German war criminals appeared in court today to make their final appeals. The defendants were completely different from when they first entered the dock. Since September, they have constantly heard the prosecutors present the various crimes against humanity they committed, and they have undergone changes psychologically and physiologically. According to Agence France-Presse, Nazi representative Hess said: "I cannot accept foreigners interfering in German domestic affairs. I was the most loyal servant of Führer Hitler, and I have no regrets." Former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then spoke, saying, "I only feel guilty about one thing, and that is the failure of my foreign policy, but this is in relation to my compatriots, not to the court. The injustice of the Treaty of Versailles led to World War II, which later generations will surely prove." Goering indirectly expressed regret in his defense yesterday, saying, "I firmly declare that I have always opposed any massacres and atrocities, and if it had been within my power, I would definitely have stopped them. I have no ambition to enslave foreign countries. My only goal is to protect my compatriots and fight for their happiness and freedom." Admiral Dönitz also argued that the German Navy did not engage in inhumane submarine warfare. Former Nazi Governor of Bohemia and Moravia Streicher, an important anti-Semitic figure, now placed all responsibility for the massacres on Hitler and Himmler.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Listening to Paris, 31st Broadcast, Nuremberg News] Nuremberg Tribunal President Sir Lawrence declared that the court will begin its deliberations on the verdict on September 23 in a secret session.</p>
<h3>Commander of British Army in Southeast Asia Replaced</h3>

<h3>Chinese Students Testify in Japan; Expose Truth of Japanese Torture; Many Innocent Young People Killed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal heard this afternoon the cruel story of the Japanese using "three-level punishment" on underground workers among Chinese students in Peiping. This testimony was given by a young Chinese student who listed at least ten types of three-level punishment methods, including flogging with a horse whip, water torture, palm drilling, fingernail pulling, sitting on a charcoal stove, electric shock, and thumb hanging. Another testimony stated that after two Japanese soldiers were killed in Peiping in July 1940, the Japanese arrested more than 1,000 Chinese students, half of whom were subjected to three-level punishment and died, while the rest were shot. Prosecutors have so far submitted to the court more than 30 testimonies and documents from eyewitnesses of Japanese atrocities in various parts of China, including Nanjing, Changsha, Guangzhou, Jiangsu, Hebei, Hubei, and Shandong.</p>
<h3>Japanese Compensation Plan Drafted; Soviet Union Moves Materials from Eastern Three Provinces; Not Entitled to Share Domestic Assets; China Will Accept Japanese Assets Within Its Borders</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] According to diplomatic sources here, the United Nations has drafted a Japanese compensation plan. According to this plan, the Soviet Union will not be allocated domestic assets because the Soviet Union refused to include former Japanese assets within the Eastern Three Provinces of China in the compensation items, which prevented the Far Eastern Commission from forming a comprehensive compensation evaluation committee to plan for compensation as a whole. According to the estimate of US Compensation Commissioner Pauley, the industrial equipment that the Soviet Union moved out of the Eastern Three Provinces is valued at US$2 billion. Under these circumstances, the Allies decided to negotiate individual deals for Japanese domestic assets, excluding the Soviet Union from the list of beneficiary countries. At the same time, China will accept the former Japanese assets within its borders. The United States and Canada are less concerned about Japanese compensation. The main recipients of Japanese domestic assets are the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, the British Dominions, and French Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Occupation Ends After 27 Years; French Troops Withdraw from Lebanon</h3>

According to Agence France-Presse Athens, British and American observer delegations are divided into 100 groups to supervise the voting. US delegation leader Morris is responsible for the Athens area, and British delegation leader Winter is responsible for the Larissa and Thessaloniki areas. At the same time, according to US Acting Secretary of State Acheson, the United States does not intend to interfere with the Greek plebiscite.

<h3>Convicted of Serving as Secretary-General of the "Commerce Control"; Lin Kanghou Sentenced to Six Years; Pan Yang Acquitted and Granted Bail; Gao Jimin, Fei Gongxia, and Five Other Traitors Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the end of the month, and the High Court finalized the trials of a large number of suspected traitors. They are: (1) Gao Jimin, president of the puppet *Lili Society*, sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. (2) Fei Gongxia, former director of the Tax Division of the puppet Ministry of Finance, sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for eight years. (3) Tan Tiankai, deputy director of the Education Department of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai City, sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years. (4) Yu Hualong, deputy director of the Preparation Committee for the Baojia Autonomy of the puppet Shanghai City, sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years. (5) Yin Dingyi, former lieutenant general and advisor of the puppet government, sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years.</p>
<p>Lin Showed No Expression</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, director and secretary-general of the puppet Commerce Control Council, was sentenced on the same day by the High Court to six years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for six years, and all of his property was confiscated except for what was necessary for his family to live on. The presiding judge explained the judgment, saying: "When the puppet Nationalist government was first established, you were invited to participate. At that time, you were still able to maintain your integrity and refused, so you were wanted by the puppet government. When Hong Kong fell, you were captured by [the Japanese] and escorted to Shanghai by special plane. At that time, your situation was not without difficulties. Although you served in a puppet position, you did not commit any major crimes, so the sentence was reduced accordingly. If you are not satisfied, you can apply to the Supreme Court in Nanjing for a retrial." Lin showed no expression upon hearing the judgment and was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>
<p>Pan Left with a Smile</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao, former secretary of the Four Banks Savings Association, was arrested after the victory. The High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted him on suspicion of being a traitor because he served as chairman of the Yongfeng Bank, engaged in business with enemy and puppet banks, disrupted finances, and published the articles "Demands for Autonomy and Self-Respect" and "How to Increase Production" in the puppet newspaper, which were suspected of advocating for the enemy and puppet regime. The case was concluded by the High Court, and Judge Liu announced yesterday that he was acquitted. The reason was that the Yongfeng Bank was investigated by the court and found to be an ordinary commercial bank, and there was no financial dealings with the enemy and puppet regime. The defendant could not be held criminally responsible. The content of the articles published in the puppet newspaper did not contain any meaning of resistance to the government, so it could not be convicted based on unfavorable inferences. When the defendant's family and friends in the audience heard the words "not guilty" yesterday, they all exclaimed. Some were so overjoyed that they tried to clap their hands, but were quickly stopped by those sitting next to them. The defendant's defense lawyer, Jiang Pingfan, requested that the defendant be released on bail, which was approved after deliberation by the court. He was ordered to be available for questioning at any time. His family and defense lawyer rushed to complete all the procedures, and Pan was released at around 5 p.m. that afternoon. Pan, with a book of Western clothes under his left arm and a paper fan in his right hand, wearing a white silk gown, boarded a car with more than a dozen family members and friends who had come to greet him, and drove away with a smile.</p>
<h3>Qian Dasu Under Interrogation: Lavish Talk of Reserve Certificates, Pushing All Responsibility onto Zhou Fo-hai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning, Qian Dagai, the Deputy Governor of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, was personally interrogated by Chief Judge Liu Hangui of the High Court. Qian wore a light grey silk long gown, black cloth shoes, kept long hair, and carried a folding fan. He was not tall, and his appearance was quite similar to Chen Gongbo. After being brought to the court, Chief Judge Liu questioned him one by one. Qian confessed: he is forty-nine years old this year, from Taicang, Jiangsu. He resides at No. 1015, Yuanyuan Road. He graduated from the Commercial Department of Tianjin Beiyang Law and Politics College, and later studied at the Research Department of Meiji University in Japan. After returning to China, he served as the manager of the Dalian branch of Jin Cheng Bank. In the autumn of the 27th year, when the puppet Reformed Government was established and the puppet China Development Bank was being organized, someone was sent to Dalian to invite me to participate, but I resolutely refused. In the 29th year, I came to Shanghai to attend the bank's business meeting. At that time, Wang Jingwei and Zhou Fo-hai had already fled to Shanghai. I had known Zhou before the war. We met by chance, and Zhou talked about coming here to maintain the livelihood of the southeastern half of the country. At that time, I did not fully believe him and returned to Dalian. However, the situation there was very difficult, as the presiding judge should understand. I stayed in the Northeast for a long time and was very clear about the September 18th Incident. After returning to Shanghai, I strongly advised Zhou Fo-hai not to believe the Japanese. Zhou still said that he came here to maintain the livelihood of the people in the southeast half of the country, and that working with him was the same as working with the central government.</p>
<p>At that time, I was forced by the environment and impulsively driven by patriotism, so I joined the puppet government in May of the 29th year. At the end of that year, the Reserve Bank was established, and its primary purpose was to overthrow the enemy military currency and abolish it. Its organization included four bureaus (Business, Issuance, Treasury, Foreign Exchange) and three sections (General Affairs, Investigation, Auditing). Zhou Fo-hai served as the Governor, and I served as the Deputy Governor. From January of the 30th year to April of the 31st year, I also concurrently served as the manager of the Shanghai branch. Later, I resigned from the concurrent position, and Dai Ailu took over. The duties of the Deputy Governor were to assist the Governor in handling bank affairs under the Governor's orders. However, Zhou Fo-hai was very dictatorial. At the beginning of the 30th year, he ordered that all internal and external documents and reports would not take effect unless approved by the Governor himself. Therefore, I had nothing to do. In May of the 31st year, it was stipulated that two yuan of legal tender be exchanged for one yuan of puppet currency. The reason is unknown. This was decided by the puppet Central Political Conference, and the defendant was not qualified to participate. As a result, a total of 4.5 billion yuan of legal tender was recovered. The circulation limit of puppet currency to the north was only as far as Xuzhou. The total amount of issuance when the handover was completed in September of last year was 380 million yuan (the High Prosecutor's Office indictment stated that it was a total of 460 million yuan. The defendant's defense lawyer stated to the court that the defendant made a clear handover in September of the 34th year, but new puppet currency was still issued in January of the 35th year. Please investigate this matter). The Central Reserve Bank used one million yuan of legal tender as capital. The reserve fund was handed over to the Central Bank last year, totaling more than 52,000 gold bars, 5.5 million US dollars, more than 7.6 million taels of silver, and other unknown items. During his tenure, the defendant did not use the convenience of the war to hoard, speculate, or make loans for profit. At that time, the discount phenomenon caused by the shortage of cash was also eliminated by me. Before the victory, I recovered a large number of gold bars borrowed from enemy banks such as Zhengjin Bank. After the victory, I jointly maintained security and finance with Zhou Fo-hai. Therefore, the defendant's motivation for participating in the puppet government was being forced and induced. After participating, I only focused on affairs and never made any speeches or suggestions on administration or principles. The defendant always believed that Zhou Fo-hai was ordered to be in the occupied area to maintain the southeastern half of the country. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>On the same day, many cases were investigated:</p>
<p>Xie Xiaochu</p>
<p>Forty-three years old, from Guangdong, manager of Shanghai Zhonghua Chemical Company, chairman of the puppet Shanghai Chemical Raw Material Trade Association, and special committee member of the Economic Committee of the puppet Central Political Council. When he was interrogated yesterday, he looked haggard and could not stand up. He sat on a chair and answered questions. He was wearing a blue silk robe, white pants, grey socks, old black leather shoes, long hair and beard, and looked worried. He stated to the court: the puppet association was forced to organize, and I could not do business. Supplying chemical raw materials to the enemy is really unjust. These were seized and taken away by soldiers using their own vehicles.</p>
<p>Li Fang</p>
<p>Previously served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In August of the 30th year, the puppet government successively appointed him as the puppet minister to Romania, and the puppet ambassador to Germany and concurrently the puppet minister to Hungary. In the spring of the 34th year, he changed the China Hongmen United Association to the China Hongmen General Association and hired Japanese military officers such as Kawamoto as consultants. In August of the 34th year, he took his family to the mainland. When he reached Tunxi, he heard that the enemy had surrendered and turned back. He was arrested in Hangzhou. He claimed in court yesterday that he stood up and hired Japanese as consultants because he could not bear to see the enemy destroy the tradition of the Hongmen. This was a perfunctory measure.</p>
<p>You Jusun</p>
<p>Fifty years old, from Wuxi. In August of the 26th year, he organized a local association with the late Gu Xin-yi. It was officially established in March of the 27th year. He served as the executive director and hired Japanese military officers such as Okino as consultants. When the puppet Dadao Municipal Government was established, he once again served as a counselor for the puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Protection Command. After the victory, he surrendered himself. He stated in court yesterday that the organization of the local association was to maintain the locality, and that he assumed the title of puppet counselor in order to facilitate travel.</p>
<p>Chen Zi</p>
<p>Fifty-nine years old, from Hangzhou, chairman of the puppet Edible Oil Industry Association, and director of the puppet Oil and Grain Control Committee. He stated to the court yesterday: before taking the puppet position, he received threatening letters repeatedly, so he was forced to do so and it was out of necessity.</p>
<p>Zeng Ronglin Meicun and Hou Pan</p>
<p>Also, the verdicts for puppet Zeng Rong and Lin Meicun, an employee of the puppet Opium Suppression Bureau, were concluded yesterday and are scheduled to be announced on September 7th.

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute in the Southern Goods Industry Resolved</h3>
<p>The city's southern goods industry has more than 500 companies and more than 3,000 employees. Previously, a labor-management dispute occurred due to requests to adjust wages, which had been deadlocked for a month. Yesterday morning, the industry went on strike. The city police bureau dispatched police to patrol in order to maintain security. As a result, the Lao Zha branch arrested 23 workers, the Taishan branch arrested 2 workers, and the Huangpu branch arrested more than 10 workers. Representatives of the workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for this, and the bureau stated that if work could be resumed, all would be released. In order to comply with the order of the Social Affairs Bureau, the industry's workers resumed work in the afternoon. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, labor and management were mediated by the bureau, and it was decided that wages would remain unchanged. Salaries would be paid twice a month, with base salaries of 35 to 50 yuan for Grade A, 25 to 40 yuan for Grade B, 21.50 to 35.70 yuan for Grade C, and 18 to 28 yuan for Grade D. In addition, allowances will be added. The labor side requested a base number of 20 yuan for Grade A, 18 yuan for Grade B, and 14 yuan for Grade C, while the management side only agreed to 20 yuan for Grade A, 15 yuan for Grade B, and 10 yuan for Grade C. As a result, the labor and management reached a settlement and agreed to resume work today.</p>

<h3>General Feng Yuxiang's Impromptu Poem at the Literary Association's Farewell Party</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The General Association of the China National Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a tea party yesterday afternoon at the Hongmian Restaurant to bid farewell to General Feng Yuxiang, who will soon be going abroad. More than 100 people attended, making it a grand occasion. Feng claimed that he was a retired soldier and was very excited to go to the United States to study water conservancy. He also said that China could no longer fight civil wars and needed peace and efforts to build the country. During the meeting, Feng also responded to the joint request of reporters and wrote a poem on the spot: "Feng Yuxiang, retired, to many places, talking about peace and democracy. Seeing my good friends, already gone, holding the coffin, tears streaming down. Recalling the past nine years, defeated and lost territory, returning this time, feeling completely ashamed, unworthy of the elders, unworthy of the sisters. Today, the cultural circles, friends are bidding me farewell, what can I say, feeling really painful. If culture flourishes, it can rank with the Han and Tang dynasties, if culture declines, politics will not advance. Not just saying it casually, check both China and foreign countries, past and present. A few words from a rough soldier, I don't know what help they are?" In the evening at 7:00 PM, Feng was also invited to attend a citizen movement dinner party. This morning at 10:00 AM, he will also be invited to attend and speak at the public service at the Great Guangming Theater.</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Director Reports on Four Months of Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, and Chen Bangxian, Director of the Epidemic Prevention Department of the bureau, reported on the epidemic prevention situation in the past four months at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon. He said that from the discovery of the first cholera case to August 30th, the total number of patients was 4,243, with a total of 24 deaths. The mortality rate of patients is about 8% or 9%, which is actually lower than the historical valley mortality rate. Recently, affected by the "autumn tiger," the tiger epidemic may become rampant again, so I hope that citizens still need to be vigilant at all times. The garbage problem was also reported. After Zhang finished speaking, Ms. Stevens, the Executive Director of the American Medical Aid to China Association, gave a speech. She first introduced that the American Medical Aid to China Association aims to help China achieve victory. During the War of Resistance, the association's total funding for China was more than 10 million US dollars. Now that China has won, the association's current task is to observe what kind of help China needs in the transition from war to peace, and then decide how to achieve it in various ways. The association has now established two major projects: "Blood Bank" and "Salt Water Factory," specializing in blood transfusions and the manufacture of saline. In the future, it hopes to run more businesses to complete its mission of assisting China. After the meeting, Director Zhang also held a New Life Evening at the City Bank Building on Jiujiang Road to entertain those responsible for the city's press and those involved in health.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Bloodshed: Shooting Friend and Wife</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Han Yongfu, a fruit vendor at No. 203 Lai'anli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, and his wife Dong Xindi were chatting in the pavilion room yesterday at halftime when their friend Xie Ronggen suddenly entered the room, looking extremely fierce.

Xie then fled. After the Hongkou Police Bureau received the report, it immediately ordered stock officers Ying Rumuo and Ma Guanliang to rush to the scene to investigate.

<h3>Reasons for the Verdict in the Lin Kanghou Case</h3>
<p>Special Criminal Judgment of the Shanghai High Court (Special Character No. 256 of the 35th Year of the Republic of China). Public Prosecutor: Prosecutor of this court. Defendant: Lin Kanghou, male, 71 years old, Shanghainese, Secretary-General of the puppet Commercial Control Association, residing at No. E102, Lane 468, Lin Sen Middle Road, Shanghai. Appointed defense attorneys: Lawyer Jiang Yiping, Lawyer Fu Kuanglin.</p>
<p>The right defendant was prosecuted by the prosecutor for treason, and the verdict of this court is as follows: (Facts omitted) (Reasons) The defendant, Lin Kanghou, served as the director, secretary-general, and executive director of the puppet National Commercial Control Association. His position as secretary-general was to handle documents and internal affairs under the orders of the puppet director, and he repeatedly confessed this in this court and during the investigation, which coincided with the circumstances stated in his confession. He first served as a puppet director, holding meetings once a month, and later served as a puppet executive director, holding meetings weekly to discuss association affairs and the purchase and distribution of materials, which can also be verified by the minutes of the puppet National Commercial Control Association director meetings, and the facts have been clearly established. According to the Provisional Regulations of the puppet National Commercial Control Association, the puppet National Commercial Control Association is the general organization for promoting the enemy puppet's new economic policy, and its main task is to handle the purchase and distribution of controlled materials, which is beneficial to the enemy puppet and unfavorable to this country. The defendant participated in this organization and held an important position, which should constitute a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, in accordance with Article 3 of the said ordinance. His arguments were divided into four points: (1) The defendant was under strict surveillance by the enemy, his actions were no longer free, and he was forced to take the puppet position, not willingly betraying and submitting to the puppet. (2) During Tang Shoumin's term as the puppet director, the defendant ignored and did not hear about the association's affairs, and had nothing to say. (3) When Lan Ting took office as the puppet director, he was invited to serve as the puppet secretary-general, only handling document affairs and tightening up association affairs in order to end them. (4) The association rescued underground worker Yang Yu-shen to benefit the War of Resistance, etc. Regarding the first point, it is true that the defendant was taken back to Shanghai from Hong Kong by the enemy army after the outbreak of the Pacific War, and his actions were not completely free. However, his appointment as a director of the puppet Commercial Control Association was due to the appointment of the puppet government, and it cannot be proven that he was subjected to any violence or coercion to the extent that he could not resist. Therefore, his submission to the puppet was not without consideration. Moreover, he held the puppet position for two years, and there should not have been no opportunity to avoid it in the middle, but he was re-elected again and again until the victory. It is obviously a pretext to say that it was not voluntary. Regarding the second point, the resolutions of the puppet Commercial Control Association are the expression of the general will of the puppet directors present. The defendant admitted that he attended the puppet director meetings once a month when Tang Shoumin served as the puppet director in another case. Therefore, he should bear considerable responsibility for the resolution, which is in line with the condition of having criminal conduct as defined in Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 3101, and he may not attempt to shirk responsibility by claiming to ignore and not hear about it. Regarding the third point, it is true that the defendant served as the secretary-general of the puppet Commercial Control Association and handled documents and daily affairs under the orders of the puppet director. However, the puppet Commercial Control Association is the general organization for promoting the enemy puppet's new economic policy, as mentioned above. Since the defendant and the puppet director had a connection of will and shared a part of the criminal conduct, they were joint principals. Whether the position held was primary and whether the scope of handling was reduced can only be used as a reference for sentencing and has nothing to do with the establishment of the crime. Regarding the fourth point, according to the witness Yang Yu-shen, the defendant rescued the underground worker Yang Yu-shen because his family reportedly asked the defendant to rescue him. This is still no more than seeking favors for private individuals at the request of friends, and it is not enough to talk about actions that benefit the people. All of the above defenses cannot be used as arguments for his exemption from responsibility or reduction of sentence. However, it was found that when the puppet National Government was established, he refused to participate and was ordered to be wanted, as evidenced by the newspaper in the case file, and he was still able to maintain his integrity at that time. When the Pacific War broke out, he was taken to Shanghai from Hong Kong by the enemy army and his actions were restricted again, and his situation was not without difficulties. Only because he had a considerable position in the financial community, he was finally appointed as a director and secretary-general of the puppet Commercial Control Association, which is different from those who willingly submitted to the enemy from the beginning, and there was no obvious wrongdoing during his tenure in the puppet position. After careful consideration of his criminal motives, there is still room for forgiveness, so the sentence is measured within the scope of the statutory penalty in Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, and all his property was confessed in the file of the Military Statistics Bureau. Except for the necessary living expenses for the family, it will be confiscated together. Secondly, regarding the allegation in the indictment that the defendant reorganized his jointly operated Hequn Chemical Factory into the Merui Chemical Factory to manufacture alcohol to aid the enemy, the defendant argued that he only served as the chairman of the Hequn Factory, and did not hold any position after the Hequn Factory was leased to the Merui Factory and was not responsible for the affairs of the Merui Factory. The testimony of Hequn shareholder Wang Zhi-san is the same. Since the defendant had no relationship with the Merui Factory, regardless of whether the factory had any alcohol-aided enemy activity, it is difficult to prosecute him with any crime. As for his appointment as a consultant to the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, there is no evidence of any substantive crimes, and no discussion should be made.</p>
<p>In summary, it should be based on Article 1 of the Special Regulations on Litigation of Events, the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Articles 1, 3, 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, the same as Paragraph 2, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, the first section of Article 28, Article 57, Article 37, Paragraph 2, and the judgment is made according to the main text. Prosecutor Qu Rong of this case attended the court to perform his duties. August 31, 35th year of the Republic of China, Liu Yugui, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court of the Shanghai High Court, Judges Cao Jun, Qiu Huanhao.</p>
<h3>The China Textile Corporation Sued for Embezzlement: Investigation Proves Allegations False</h3>
<p>Regarding the case in which the China Textile Corporation (中紡公司) was sued for embezzlement by senior staff of the New Prosperity Company (新興公司), a business receiving enemy assets and selling them off cheaply, and for unsound internal organization of the China Textile Corporation leading to irregularities, the investigation team has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the case. It has been learned that the original complaint alleging the sale of small quantities of goods at low retail prices while large quantities were wholesaled to brokers is inaccurate. After retrieving and reviewing the comparison table of retail and wholesale sales of the New Prosperity Company and cross-referencing it with the company's daily sales reports, the information was found to be largely correct. Regarding the allegations in the original complaint that the sale prices were several times lower than the market price but several times higher than the listed retail price, and that the proceeds were reported based on the very low listed retail price, with the surplus being shared privately by Zhang and Xu of the cloth department, resulting in frequent quarrels, and that each person could allegedly earn tens of millions of yuan in extra income per month, the manager of the New Prosperity Company, Yu Naidan, was consulted. He stated that the company's goods were priced according to the following four standards: (1) due to the style and trademark being commonly used by the Japanese, (2) due to the incompleteness of sizes, types, and colors, (3) due to damage and defects, and (4) due to sacrificing a portion of the profit. After valuation, a sales price report was prepared and sent to the head office for approval daily. The price of goods entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Disposal Administration for sale was determined by the China Textile Corporation, but the selling price was necessarily higher than the bottom price. The wholesale price was lower than the market price, but some items were sold at the market price. All proceeds were fully recorded and turned over to the public. After reviewing the company's daily sales reports, the information was found to be largely consistent. The allegations in the original complaint that the price was several times higher than the listed price are unlikely. As for the English complaint involving the internal organizational problems of the China Textile Corporation and its malpractices, it was not investigated as it was irrelevant to the receiving and disposal work.</p>

<h3>Futures and Spot Yarn: Few Factories Have Not Received Orders, Cotton Construction Cloth Listing Has Not Changed, Sales of Cold Brand Yarn from Small Factories Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Cotton Construction opened cloth yesterday, and factories and stores applying for purchase were still extremely crowded. On the surface, the listing has not changed, but the B Dragon Head Fine Cloth at 56,000 is exactly equal to the price of the genuine brand before the exchange rate changes. The price of fancy goods such as electrical slanting and Four Gentlemen Biji, etc., is also slightly higher than before the 19th, but the increase is limited, and it is still cheaper than the black market. Many stores located far in the suburbs also came to open goods yesterday. On the market, the sound of adding 4,000 or 5,000 is still all over the place, fortunately, the black market has fallen by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan, and the people's hearts seem to have settled down slightly. The goods concentrated and dispatched by private yarn factories under the control of Cotton Construction and other institutions the other day were originally allocated according to the spindles of each factory. In terms of its opening price, it has indeed reduced the black market by about 200,000 yuan. Although the market is not "full," the 6,000 to 7,000 pieces of yarn have absorbed a lot of silver capital. Unfortunately, there are still a few yarn factories that have not received orders, so how should the institution that concentrates and dispatches goods be strengthened? It remains to be seen the efforts of the Cotton Construction authorities. Double Horse is the most valuable brand, with thin and long bars, which is most popular with the Guang Gang. Shenxin currently has more than 300,000 yarn spindles, and the output is of course considerable. However, this goods has always been based on opening futures, and the spot allocation is not easy, so the actual users in this city do not welcome it. The yarn factory knows its reason, but it still attaches importance to the store when opening goods the other day. It is also not allowed to be properly rewarded, and the situation of other famous brands is slightly similar to this. As for the cold brand small factory, it is heard that it is still bitter and happy, and Changzhou goods are also 20 counts, and some are only sold for a little more than 1 million, and there is still a lack of owners. Therefore, some observers pointed out that most of the yarn opened by the yarn factory concentration the other day will still flow into the market as chips. Those familiar with the market situation speculate that if the private yarn price dispatch price can be established, Cotton Construction may appropriately increase its listing price.</p>
<p>Also, the yarn market rose unanimously yesterday. Although private yarn factories opened thousands of pieces of cotton yarn packed in 400-pound decorations the other day to assist the authorities, and the opening price was 100,000 to 200,000 lower than the market price. Logically, the market price should be small. However, the yarn thrown out by the factories were not spot goods, and they were successively dispatched after about 10 days, and some were delayed for more than a month. Therefore, customers who need to sell immediately deeply felt that the distant water could not save the near fire, so they released the price to search for spot goods and rushed to install boats and vehicles. Therefore, the spot price of yarn was very popular yesterday, and the 20 counts rose by 50,000 to 100,000, and the 41 counts rose by about 150,000 to 200,000. The people's hearts were abnormally prosperous, and it was agreed that the old brand 20 counts of the Japanese factory produced by Cotton Construction had the strongest rise, and the Fengnian Blue Phoenix had returned to the 1.4 million mark.</p>
<h3>Gold Notes Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterdays opened very steady, opened at 2,065,000 in the morning, and there was still considerable pressure after opening, gradually downstream, fell to 2,045,000 before it began to stabilize. After 10:00, the Central Bank allocated 92 bars at a price of 2,055,000, and stood above 2,060,000 at noon. It was slightly tired in the afternoon, but due to Saturday's relationship, there were not many transactions. As a result, the closing was slightly down by 4,000 from the previous day. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars have not changed. The dark discount of silver capital is very tight, and the normal interest rate is about 15%, and there are occasionally special and large users who have raised it to more than 20%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies are more peaceful. US dollars opened at 3,330 yuan in the morning, with supply, and the low price retreated to 3,320 yuan, and then always hovered between 3,320 yuan and 3,335 yuan. It was slightly sluggish in the afternoon, and the result was down 15 yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong tickets were affected by the Shen telegram reaching 141 yuan strong, and Guang Gang continued to stuff out in order to absorb silver capital, and retreated to about 700 yuan, and the result fell by another 5 yuan. Hong Kong electricity was 715 yuan, Indian Exchange was 862 yuan, and British Exchange was 1,145 yuan, all of which were available for sale, and there were not many transactions, and the US exchange still stood at the listing price.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Fell Slightly</h3>
<p>Government bonds were tired at first and then stabilized. There were still many bulls who closed, but because a certain number absorbed more than 2 million yuan in face value on behalf of a certain bank in the financial sector, with this help, it was finally pulled up, and the situation was uncertain. The unified C was 2,300 yuan, and there were multiple sales from several companies after opening, and the low price retreated to 2,030 yuan, and then buyers participated, and gradually rose to 2,600 yuan, and was still oppressed by the outflow, and finally remained below 2,400 yuan. As a result, the closing was slightly down 50 yuan from the previous day, and the remaining A, B, and E rose 50 yuan, while the unified D was flat.</p>
<h3>White Coal Returns to Ginger</h3>
<p>Yangquan White Coal Blocks and the National League rounds continue to arrive. The coal merchants of the round originally booked 1,200 tons, but because spot goods are not easy to collect in Tianjin, only more than 300 tons were transported. Although the arrival is small, the market heard that there are arrivals, and the market situation suddenly loosened, and the market price saw a slight decline.</p>
<h3>Qinhuangdao Coal Transportation Will Recover Soon</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been reported that coal transportation in Qinhuangdao has been obstructed, and each household in this city that uses coal is anxious. Xu Letian, chairman of the Fuel Committee, announced that the news about the interruption of coal transportation in Qinhuangdao Kailuan is temporary in nature, and the original state will be fully restored soon, and the mining area has been strictly protected. Yesterday, the damaged railways were repaired one by one. Although there were continuous damages, Kailuan was still able to transport 7,000 tons. It was found that Shanghai currently has coal, which is enough for the southeastern provinces for three months, so there is no need to worry about fuel panic. Especially, the supply from Keelung and other sources can be increased month by month, and there is no need to worry. Chairman Xu also stated that the Fuel Committee's coal distribution price will never increase. Although the association supplies public utilities, railways, ships, and main uses, reaching 86% of the total, its selling price is still below cost.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Promotes Low-Interest Loans to Support Domestic Goods Manufacturers to Compete for the Nanyang Market</h3>
<p>Before the war, the number of our industrial products shipped to Nanyang was quite large. After the war, the Nanyang market, our domestic goods manufacturers tried to restore, but the interest rate was too high, the insurance fee was also heavy, and the traffic was blocked, so our industrial products could not be exported. The Bank of China, in view of this, sought to promote low-interest loans, support domestic goods manufacturers, so that industrial products could be exported in a source and compete for the Nanyang market, in order to achieve the development of international trade. All domestic goods manufacturers who want to transport industrial products to Nanyang for sale, the bank can handle the financing, low-interest loans, transportation insurance, are given convenience. If each manufacturer has no agency in Nanyang, the domestic goods joint company will act as a distributor. In order to facilitate the smooth handling, the bank specially invited the persons in charge of each domestic goods manufacturer to exchange views at the Cishu Building at 2:00 PM on the 30th. After the initial consultation, the loan work has been prepared, and it will be realized in the short term. The interest rate is based on 3% or more and 5% or less as a principle. It is being considered that, in addition to yarn and cloth, each industrial product for export is planned to be transported for sale.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhenmei Creates a High Price</h3>
<p>Chen Qimen Also Has a Deal</p>
<p>Chen Zhenmei, who has not had wholesale sales for a long time, is now reported by the industry that export houses in this city have received telegrams from overseas, instructing them to handle the above-mentioned colors. Therefore, the process has become clear, and the selling price has created a peak of 50,000 yuan per load. Other colors, Wuchang Dadichang Huacha Xinhua Wang Yutai, etc., have each stolen, and the market atmosphere is active, and the British and British firms negotiating with the cargo party's Gaozhuang Chen Qimen have also reached an agreement, and Jardine Matheson has bought 334 boxes at 205,000 yuan per load.</p>
<p>[Also reported] According to people in the industry, next mid-month, there will be a special ship sailing directly from this city to Casablanca, Africa. Therefore, recently, each line plans to prepare a large number of red and green teas for export. It is heard that the ship is the first trial after victory. If it can be smooth, it can be continued in the future, and the foreign sales of Chinese tea can also gradually turn around.</p>
<h3>The Method of Substituting Gold Deposits is Debated, and the Four-Bank Joint Office Makes Corrections</h3>
<p>During the war, the gold-converted legal currency deposit certificates of each bank in the rear, when they expired, were settled and exchanged for legal currency in Beijing, Shanghai, or other recovered areas. Recently, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that they should still be exchanged for gold at the original bank. Later, in order to facilitate depositors, the Central Bank of China planned to issue gold-converted deposit certificates, and the Shanghai banks implemented the exchange method, which was announced and implemented. This method, after the business review meeting of the Four-Bank Joint Office, was researched and revised, and was submitted to the 317th Board of Directors meeting for a decision. It has been communicated to each bank for compliance. The amended method of exchanging gold-converted legal currency deposits by each bank in Shanghai is recorded as follows: (1) Expired deposit certificates are exchanged through the collection method. (2) Deposits are all paid in gold. (3) Small numbers less than one tael are paid in national currency, but depositors can consolidate whole taels to exchange for gold. (4) The exchanged zero-sum gold is sold to the Central Bank of Shanghai by the exchanging bank. (5) The price of the gold exchanged for the above-mentioned zero number is based on the date the temporary receipt is issued.</p>

<h3>Foreword to "Of Man and Mouse"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yonggang</p>
<p>The rat, the mouse, it is the most detested and cursed creature by mankind. I believe its nature is not so much cowardice as it is cunning and treacherous, which is a more appropriate description. Relying on its agile body, it parasitizes among humans. It hides during the day and comes out at night, and some even dare to run rampant in broad daylight, disrupting our peaceful lives. It gnaws on our belongings, steals our food, and spreads germs that endanger our lives. If we were to compile a statistic of the losses caused by rats in a year, it would certainly be an alarming figure, no less than a terrible war.</p>
<p>I recall that a biologist once said: Given the rat's intelligence and reproductive capacity, if humans continue to slaughter each other as they are now, one day rats will conquer humanity and rule the world. Whether rats can evolve to conquer humanity and rule the world will probably require tens of thousands of years to prove definitively, so there is no need to worry prematurely.</p>
<p>However, there are some facts that now prove that rats may conquer humanity and rule the world, because humans themselves are gradually turning into rats! This does not mean that the human form will change into rats, but that human nature is gradually becoming rat-like. People use cowardice to disguise their cunning, use despicable and violent means to obtain everything, and do not hesitate to build their own happiness on the suffering of others! Whether between individuals, societies, or nations, they are engaged in infighting, theft, plunder, and even resorting to mass slaughter to achieve their aims. The records of atrocities left by Japan in the Far East and Germany and Italy in Europe are nothing more than attempts to use violence to conquer freedom-loving and peace-loving nations, and to have those fascists whose humanity is diminishing and rat-like qualities are increasing rule the world. Because two-legged rats among humans are rampant, it can also be said that rats may conquer humanity and rule the world.</p>
<p>If we want to live like a human being in this era, then we should prevent ourselves from becoming rat-like, strive to be an upright person, take on the responsibility of being human, and participate in the great struggle between man and mouse, because only by extinguishing the rats among men and eliminating the rat-like qualities in humanity can mankind enjoy freedom and peace forever.</p>
<p>The beginning of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War can be said to be the overture to the struggle of all mankind against rats. During these long eight years of turbulent life, it is even more evident who is human and who is a rat. Some people, although living a human life, have turned into rats, while others, although living an inhuman life, live like human beings and die like human beings. This play is also a story about man and mouse written in this era.</p>
<p>(Wu Yonggang's second film, "Of Man and Mouse," after "Loyal Family," has begun shooting - Editor)</p>
<h3>Scenery and Color</h3>
<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>Scenery, here is not limited to a few set pieces; it includes all images of nature, and the struggle of colors with nature. It includes the environment in which the characters in the play act, and the atmosphere of the whole play, highlighting and driving the characters' personalities.</p>
<p>Its new scope is: light, image, color, emotion, and force.</p>
<p>Dramatic art is more concrete than all other arts. However, this "concreteness," when applied to scenery, is only the lowest-level foundation, and what is built on this foundation is: the human spirit and the force of the universe. This is the artistic realm that true scenic art enters.</p>
<p>People act there for all reasons, and the environment changes because of all actions, and the environment changes people again. Their relationship is like the warp and weft of a piece of cloth, neither can do without the other. ... Each person weaves their own history.</p>
<p>The problem arises here, and it will always follow the characters with "development" with joy, anger, sorrow, joy, horror, struggle, and resistance. A few fixed-color set pieces are no longer sufficient for this heavy task. Therefore, the Viennese director Ubong, based on the method of French Impressionists, invented a "color dot intensive method," using various colors he needed, distributed in dense small dots on the backdrop. When red is needed, red light is projected to show the red dots, forming a red surface. Similarly, when green is needed, green light is projected, causing the red to recede and the green to appear. He can change the color as the play progresses, which is indeed an ingenious invention. Unfortunately, when he wants to obtain pure color, he often encounters the obstacle of complementary color afterimages. Also, if white light is projected, all the color dots applied to the scene will be revealed at the same time. This cannot but be said to be a regret, and in our country where improvisation is the norm, even the discovery of this "regret" is still far away.</p>
<p>All colors originate from light. Light is the mother of all colors. In addition to the fixed lines that are not easy to change, all the moving life of the scenery design is controlled by the light and color of the scene and the changes in the fixed colors on the backdrop. If used properly, the backdrop can be made lively, vigorous, and full of vitality. Like the wind and clouds before a storm, it can act as an envoy of the whole play in advance, in a thousand changes, and proudly step into the garden of beautiful art. Otherwise, it will be like a stubborn grain of sand, forever conflicting with the eyes of the audience, destroying your natural pleasure. (In fact, the development of drama should also be as smooth as nature).</p>
<p>The first thing that catches the eye when the curtain rises is the dramatic environment, mood, and atmosphere, which is the stage setting. It not only brews the whole play, gives the development of the whole play hints and pressure, and leads it forward, but also purifies the audience's emotions, so that the audience forgets themselves and immerses themselves in the dramatic environment, sharing joy and sorrow with the characters in the play. In this way, the emotional fluctuations of the characters in the play and the audience can tend to be consistent, and the expected dramatic effect can be achieved.</p>
<p>The other side of sorrow and sympathy is satire and humor. Tragedy requires the audience to sink into purification, while comedy always requires the audience to remain objective. Color is more active and easier to obtain this expectation than line in this regard.</p>
<h3>Weekly Movie Short Reviews</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>This week, there are more wonderful Western films than last week. Generally speaking, it is still "Lassie Come Home", but "Casablanca" shown in Lido is better than "Lassie Come Home".</p>
<p>Loyal Family</p>
<p>In the play, after the victory, as Liu Qiong made a torrent of remarks, the shadows of various colors and scenes moved away in turn, which seemed better than the ending section.</p>
<p>Lassie Come Home</p>
<p>The director's handling of the dog is better than that of the people. The segment of searching the country of Mi Tu is indeed better than the "people".</p>
<p>The Gay Sisters</p>
<p>There are many wonderful small segments in the film, but it is a pity that the director did not connect them well, so that the play became "not very good". A staircase in the installation is very well placed, and the director has made many plays on it.</p>
<p>Jean Arthur's performance is the most successful. Cary Grant is second, because the play itself is easy to please, and Oldman has no great performance.</p>
<p>Destination Tokyo</p>
<p>It is still good in the navy film, because the director also takes into account how to deal with boredom. The "underwater bomb" segment is the climax of the whole play and the best part. As for the sailor's appendicitis operation, even if it is a fact, it can be avoided, because it does not contribute to the overall situation. Except for Cary Grant, no actor is outstanding.</p>
<p>Suspicion</p>
<p>The lens is special, focusing on beauty and atmosphere. There are a few really good shots, and some very clever shots are discovered intermittently. The ending is very good, just because of the word "beauty". The camera pulls back, showing the train speeding, which is indeed the most beautiful picture. The director squeezed the other parts of the play too hard, and it is not the most successful.</p>
<p>The actor Cary Grant is above the level, and Isa Barret does not perform much.</p>
<p>Deep Valley</p>
<p>Like "Suspicion", it pays too much attention to the atmosphere and forgets the play, so it falls into the abyss of boredom. The opening and character introduction are very good.</p>
<p>The Mark of Zorro</p>
<p>This martial arts film is like watching a martial arts play of Peking Opera. At the end, there is a big set of fights, with clean hands and feet, which is indeed a good choice. Except for the segment where Xiao Fan Bengke plays the jewelry merchant, the rest cannot see any effort.</p>
<p>The Corpse Vanishes</p>
<p>It is not up to the standard, and the clues are not clear enough. The action processing is only the last section of the murderer's car driver escaping and being brought to justice. Gilsey Morris does not follow his heart.</p>
<p>This week, the actress laurel crown was won by Jean Arthur, followed by Cary Grant.</p>
<p>(1) Jean Arthur, in "The Gay Sisters".</p>
<p>(2) Nancy, in "Lassie Come Home".</p>
<p>(3) Cary Grant, in "The Gay Sisters".</p>
<p>(4) Cary Grant, in "Destination Tokyo".</p>
<p>(5) Oldman, in "The Gay Sisters".</p>
<h3>King of Singers: Bing Crosby</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Bing Crosby neither has a suave and elegant demeanor, nor is he born with a pleasing face. His fame cannot be compared with the former Valentino or John Barrymore; he has accumulated many years of study, continuous efforts, and won people over with real talent. When he was in his thirties, he just began to emerge, and at first he only played minor roles in short films in Hollywood, but he had the spirit of perseverance. In 1934, he had already occupied seven seats among the highest-grossing stars in Hollywood, and by 1937 he had risen to fourth place. By 1944, his reputation had reached its peak; that year, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his starring role in "Going My Way", and at the same time, he also dominated the box office champion for that film; in 1945, he won the same throne again. In total, within the most effective twelve years, Bing Crosby has been in the top ten highest-grossing stars in the United States more than six times, and he can indeed be proud of himself.</p>
<p>Bing Crosby has been successful in art; but off-screen he is a standard husband and a respectable father. He has four boys, and his wife's name is Dixie. He often admits that he has only had a romance with Ms. Dixie in his life; it is well known in Hollywood that he is not fond of women, and his wife can indeed be called a virtuous helper. Before marriage, Bing once indulged in gambling such as horse racing, but after meeting Dixie, he abandoned his bad habits and focused on his career; the two have been married for more than twelve years and are still as loving as paint, and who doesn't envy them?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of World War II, Bing Crosby's singing has truly relieved the spiritual suffering of many people. After listening to his singing, we will forget everything, and a feeling of joy will arise in our hearts. American public opinion says that Bing Crosby's singing is immortal, and people all over the world will never tire of listening to his singing.</p>

<h3>About Loyal Family</h3>
<p>— Wu Linren</p>
<p>This time, "Loyal Family" was staged under the expectations of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a little excited! Everyone wanted to be the first to see it! This is the first sound of domestic films after the victory! "Yes, the first domestic blockbuster after the victory"!</p>
<p>Seeing the touching performances on the screen, especially when we are now suffering after reflection, everyone was so excited that they wanted to cry. Rolling household registration rice, rushing through barbed wire, hunger, blockade, we have all personally experienced and witnessed these things. Today, when we recall the days of slavery, we still have deep lingering pain!</p>
<p>If it is said that it is a patriotic story depicting a loyal family, it is better to say that it is a great narrative poem. Let us make a detailed appeal of the life we have lived under the trampling and coercion of the Japanese devils in the past few years, so that the descendants of hundreds of millions of Chinese people know what it means to be "people who do not want to be slaves", and let many, many people feel how urgently they need light and freedom!</p>
<p>We feel cordial and lovely in terms of acting and plot. Perhaps it is because we have seen domestic films? Of course, the film itself cannot be said to be perfect, but if you realize that Chinese films are still in their infancy, you will not be willing to be harsh.</p>
<p>With the greatest sincerity, the author hopes that people engaged in the film industry will work hard, and the Chinese people are looking forward to your achievements!</p>
<p>Bless you! Chinese film. The vast masses are waving to you!</p>

<h3>Self-Comfort</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>"The soul is stronger than the sword."</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from a colleague, describing his departure from his post due to lung disease, which made me feel sad! On the eve of Journalists' Day, I really don't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the blood and sweat experiences of journalists are chilling to think about! In fact, even in a peaceful and prosperous era, no occupation in society is more difficult, stressful, contradictory, and abnormal than that of a journalist. This statement includes both spiritual and material life. It is said that a senior figure in the journalistic world once vowed that his daughter would never marry a journalist.</p>
<p>However, there are still some people who continue to follow in their footsteps and are willing to engage in this work, and the reason is Bacon's famous saying above.</p>
<p>If you lose a lofty ideal, it is best to do other business, which is much more comfortable than running around in the daytime and working under dim lights at night.</p>
<p>Today is Journalists' Day. We comfort ourselves, and we also comfort future successors.</p>
<h3>The Birth of Journalists' Day</h3>
<p>— Gang Guo</p>
<p>Journalists have a festival, which began in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. The birth of this festival has a relationship with Zhejiang Province. Originally, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department requested the Central Government to protect journalists in the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China; the National Government approved its request on September 1 of the same year, and issued a clear order for protection. The Hangzhou Journalists Association also called on the domestic journalistic community to designate September 1 as "Journalists' Day."</p>
<p>The first Journalists' Day was held on the anniversary of the National Government's promulgation of the order to protect journalists. However, it was not very sensational or enthusiastic at that time. Several cities where the national journalistic industry flourished, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, did not show anything. Only Peiping, Taiyuan, Xiamen, Changsha, Zhenjiang, and other places responded to the mobilization of Hangzhou journalists and unanimously held meetings to celebrate; the newspapers in each of these places also suspended publication for one day to "rest a little."</p>
<p>Our Journalists' Day is born in the flames of war. Since the outbreak of the all-out Anti-Japanese War in the 26th year, journalists have been active on every front line, in every rear area, and behind enemy lines. The intensity of work and the weight of responsibility made us realize the importance of "our own festival" in terms of unity, cooperation, and progress; therefore, this great festival has been celebrated more and more widely and "lively" year by year.</p>
<p>In March of the 33rd year, the government approved this holiday. The following is a telegram from the Central News Agency in Chongqing on March 25 of that year:</p>
<p>"Although Journalists' Day on September 1 has been held for many years, it has not been announced by the government. It is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs has presented it to the Executive Yuan for approval in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior, and has transferred it to the provincial and municipal governments and local journalists' associations for notification."</p>
<p>The first Journalists' Day officially designated by the government in the 33rd year was held in Chongqing, the wartime capital, by the Chinese Society of Journalism and the Chongqing Municipal Newspaper Joint Committee, at the auditorium of the Central Propaganda Department. More than 150 officials, guests, and journalists attended the meeting, which was chaired by Xiao Tongzi, chairman of the Society of Journalism. That evening, the Central Propaganda Department held a social gathering to comfort the journalists, attended by 407 journalists from various newspapers and comrades from the department. The journalists were "all very happy" at this grand event.</p>
<p>This conference was actually the last grand gathering of journalists in the wartime capital, because the war ended hastily before the next Journalists' Day. Everyone was busy with "repatriation" during the holiday in the 34th year.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Shanghai had not enthusiastically commemorated Journalists' Day before the Anti-Japanese War; during the Anti-Japanese War, because the local area fell earlier and the concessions were also dangerous due to the environment, it was inconvenient to carry out public activities. Whenever there was a holiday, we could only send our feelings remotely and celebrate with our colleagues in the mainland. Therefore, today's Shanghai journalists are happily celebrating their own festival, which is really the first time since there has been a "Journalists' Day."</p>
<h3>The First Newspaper</h3>
<p>The emergence of modern newspapers began with the Notizis Soritte (News Extracts) issued in Italy in 1566. With the invention of printing, various countries followed suit, and newspapers gradually became more developed.</p>
<p>The first daily newspaper in England was issued in 1702, named Daily Current. The first newspaper in the United States was the Newsletter of Boston in 1704.</p>
<p>The first newspaper in Japan was the "Yokohama Daily News" published in Yokohama in the third year of the Meiji era.</p>
<p>In 1815, the first Chinese newspaper issued overseas was the "Statistical Account of World Events" founded by the London Missionary Society and edited by Englishman Morrison, Medhurst, and Liang Wai, the first Chinese Christian from Guangdong.</p>
<p>The earliest Chinese newspaper that was purely capitalized and edited by Chinese people was the "Zhaowen Xinbao" published in Hankou in the twelfth year of Tongzhi.</p>
<p>Among the current newspapers, the longest-standing Shen Bao was founded on April 30 of the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872). At that time, it was founded by Englishman F. Major. It was not until the first year of the Republic of China that it was transferred to Mr. Shi Liangcai.</p>
<h3>Four More Days</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Mr. Li Fu's witty remarks</p>
<p>Three years ago, Mr. Chen Li Fu happened to be in Tunxi on Journalists' Day. That evening, at a tea party hosted by Mr. Feng Youzhen to welcome Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen wore a summer cloth gown, waved a folding fan, and talked and laughed. He said: "Journalists: Journalists are accounting teachers. It is more difficult than ordinary teachers; you see, Teachers' Day is August 27, while Journalists' Day is September 1, which is a full four days more than Teachers' Day!" It was both solemn and humorous, and the meaning was profound, and the audience burst into laughter.</p>
<h3>How Many Newspapers Are There in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Qiao Qiao Zhi</p>
<p>Let me tell you: There are currently forty-three kinds of newspapers in this city, large and small, including foreign languages.</p>
<p>Among these forty-three newspapers, classified by national boundaries, there are: 34 kinds of Chinese newspapers; 4 kinds of English newspapers, 2 kinds of Russian newspapers, and 1 kind each of Japanese and French newspapers.</p>
<p>Among the 34 kinds of Chinese newspapers, they can be divided into: 19 kinds of large daily newspapers, 9 kinds of small daily newspapers, and 6 kinds of evening newspapers.</p>
<p>Shanghai Dynamics</p>
<h3>Banning Street Vendors</h3>
<p>— Chang Nian</p>
<p>Smuggled American goods will disappear from today. The deadline is too short, and it is difficult for vendors to change careers.</p>
<p>The street vendors in Shanghai today are as dense as scales, and the atmosphere is vigorous, which has never been seen before. It is estimated that there are more than 25,000 vendors and merchants in the city. They sell a variety of goods, including clothing, food, and daily necessities. Walking on a relatively lively street is like walking into a department store.</p>
<p>However, from today (September 1), you will not see the remaining stalls except for book and newspaper, snack, and cigarette stalls, because the municipal government has ordered a ban on the 20th of this month. On the morning of the 28th, more than 10,000 vendors in the city gathered a team in Xikou Road to petition the municipal government, demanding that the order be withdrawn or the deadline be extended, but they did not get results. The livelihoods of tens of thousands of people are about to become a problem.</p>
<p>The rise of stall sales in this city has only been in the past three or four years. It is precisely a reflection of the sluggish market. During the period when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, the poverty of life reached its extreme. Those with courage and strength opened up "single gang" business, and those who were weak and afraid of hardship had to set up stalls near their houses and live on small businesses. At that time, it was profitable to sell cigarettes, so there was a time when the streets of Shanghai were filled with large and small cigarette stalls and small suitcases. Later, when cigarettes were no longer profitable, those vendors changed to other businesses, silver dollar stalls, candy stalls, pastry stalls, ... appeared one after another. Until the victory came, it was still not easy for those vendors to find jobs, so they had to do their old business. At first, the vendors who bought and sold legal tender and fake money were prosperous for a long time. They had keen eyes and only cared about increasing their income. Seeing that American goods were cheap and of good quality and easy to sell, they took the opportunity to resell them for profit, and their income was very good. Recently, in order to avoid competition among more and more "American goods stalls" and to avoid losses to each other, they secretly formed an organization. When there were American goods, they raised money to buy them and then divided them according to shares, and outsiders could not ask about them.</p>
<p>In order to save expenses, the things in the hands of these vendors were indeed cheaper than those in the market, so they were easy to sell, and the income was enough to maintain the lives of two or three people.</p>
<p>The prosperity of vendors is a slightly abnormal phenomenon. If they are allowed to set up stalls for a long time, it will not only damage the appearance of the city, but also hinder traffic. Therefore, this time the municipal government's resolute measures are reasonable. However, I think that the municipal government only issued the order on August 20, and the deadline for the ban is only a short ten days, which is too late for them to change careers. If the facts can be taken into account and the time limit can be slightly extended, the implementation of the policy will definitely be unimpeded.</p>
<h3>Page of Glory</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>Remembering the Martyred Journalists of Shanghai</p>
<p>Joyfully celebrating Journalist's Day, I am filled with boundless emotion, for this is our very own festival. Yet, in this joy, we can never forget those who sacrificed themselves before the Pacific War, writing a "Page of Glory" in the history of journalists' struggles. They ascended to the cross in order to fulfill their historical mission.</p>
<p>The Assassination of Zhang Sixu—He was the editor of the then-Great American Evening News. Because he staunchly adhered to his post as a journalist, he repeatedly received threatening letters from the traitor Wang Jingwei, including various despicable threats, but he did not yield. Due to the requirements of his position, he had to maintain contact with the outside world, regardless of the danger. Although the police department dispatched a secret agent to protect him at all times, he sometimes refused to travel with the bodyguard and sped down the road in his car. Because, in his heart, he was honest and sincere, and therefore disregarded accidents.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one afternoon, Zhang Guang-sheng again drove his car to the Chee Hwa Hin café on Jing'an Temple Road. Holding a foreign magazine, he lay on the sofa, absorbed in reading, when the enemy agents had already surrounded him. As soon as he noticed, gunshots flew like snowflakes, and he died on the spot. A Polish man, moved by justice, embraced the assassin on the spot and also sacrificed himself!</p>
<p>The Bravest</p>
<p>The Tragic Death of Zhu Xinggong—Mr. Zhu was the chief editor of the night edition of the Great American Evening News. In June of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the pseudo "Special Operations Headquarters" issued the first threatening letter to editors and reporters of various newspapers, roughly stating: "If you do not change your attitude, you will be sentenced to death in absentia." After receiving this letter, Mr. Zhu bravely published a public response, which was the article "Confession of One About to Be Declared 'Death Penalty' by 'National Law'," which was widely circulated in Shanghai at the time. Anyone concerned with the newspaper industry in Shanghai could recite this article.</p>
<p>After the article was published, the pseudo "Special Operations" hated Mr. Zhu to the bone, determined to put him to death. At 4:00 PM on August 30th of the 28th year of the Republic, Mr. Zhu left his home on North Henan Road and walked to the newspaper office to work. While passing near the Riverside Mansion, three thugs suddenly blocked his path and shot him in the head. He immediately fell to the ground and died. I remember Mr. Zhu once said in his reply to the traitors and puppets: "If my head can be pierced by a ruthless bullet, then my head cannot be said to be worthless. My head has value, what regret is there in dying?" Reading this makes one feel deeply moved!</p>
<p>The Death of Cheng Zhenzhang—Mr. Cheng was the editor of the international section of the Great American Evening News. It is said that Mr. Cheng usually stayed in the newspaper office and was unusually cautious. However, because he was extremely filial to his mother, he would return home at irregular times to visit his elderly mother. He was already wary, so one day he specially disguised himself as a worker and secretly returned home. Unexpectedly, at half-past ten the next morning, just as he was leaving his house, a car was already parked by the side of the road. Judging from the situation at the time, perhaps the pseudo "Special Operations" wanted to kidnap him to western Shanghai, but in the end, he was shot three times and fell to the ground instantly. Fortunately, the Guangci Hospital was nearby, and he was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, but his injuries were severe, and he parted ways with us forever at dusk on the third day!</p>
<p>The Most Heroic</p>
<p>The Assassination of Jin Huating—Mr. Jin was a reporter for the then-Shen Bao newspaper. He was also wary and often carried a self-defense pistol when going out, returning to the newspaper office either late at night or at dawn. At this time, he was helping Mr. Feng Youzhen of the Central Propaganda Department with his work, exerting great effort. No matter how serious the situation was, he was always fearless in his travels.</p>
<p>His assassination occurred on February 3rd of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). On the afternoon of the 2nd, he and three colleagues were preparing to return to the newspaper office from a billiard room, but on the way, he suddenly turned back and said he was going to a friend's house for dinner, and told his colleagues that this friend was extremely reliable and that nothing unexpected would happen, and that he would definitely return around eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>He spent that night very peacefully, but at dawn the next day, as he was walking past the entrance of the World Automobile Company on Avenue Edward VII, preparing to hire a car back to the newspaper office, it so happened that all the cars were out on errands. He walked alone on the sidewalk, waiting for the cars to return. Unexpectedly, many thugs had already been lying in ambush and surrounded him from all sides, shooting him indiscriminately. Although he was carrying a weapon, he was unable to react in time and was shot four times, dying heroically. On this festive occasion, I happened to remember the above-mentioned heroic comrades, and wrote this hastily, just to express some inner admiration and grief, and to hope that this spirit of sacrifice will forever become the excellent tradition of our journalists! In fact, since the War of Resistance, in Shanghai and in the rear, there have been countless news practitioners who have been martyred, great unnamed heroes. We cannot fully recount their deeds, nor can we fully know them, but their greatness does not diminish because of praise on paper!</p>
