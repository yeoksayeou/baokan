<h3>國防部發言人稱　進攻延安說無稽　共方則宣稱戰爭已開始</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕國防部發言人廿日談稱：外電所傳國軍進攻延安之訊，全屬無稽。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕共產黨辦事處發言人廿日晚稱：頃根據彭德懷宣布，延安周圍政府軍隊已達十萬人，陝甘寗邊區南北西三面被圍，南綫爲胡宗南部一六五旅及一二三旅，在洛川中部一帶，第一飾及第四十九師在輯城，宜川一帶，北錢原爲第廿二軍，在榆林，神木兩地。最後有第廿八旅由咸陽空運抵榆林，兩綫馬鴻逵部第八十二師一個騎兵旅，三個地方性的保安團隊集結靈武。西綫於十七日下午十一時已開始，北綫於十六日開始，南綫於十三日開始，延安業已緊張萬分，雄備隨時作戰，此乃自一九三五年十月以來，陝甘寗邊區從未有過之戰事。此項戰事不僅是存在，且已開始，至報載朱德，毛澤東離延安訊，實不確。</p>

<p>〔又電〕延安電台廿日廣播稱　國軍先頭部隊已突入延安邊區十九哩，業與中共軍隊發生接觸，是爲國軍對赤都大規模進攻之先聲。</p>
<h3>葉劍英仍留平</h3>
<p>其他共黨人員已撤退</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕葉劍英廿日上午往訪梁漱溟，與梁氏話別。軍調部中中共發言人稱，今日軍調部之延安聯絡班機，共方僅有三人搭機返延，葉劍英仍留平候命。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕軍調部共產黨人員事實上已在陸續撤退中，關內僅留之太原，東沁，候馬等小組，俱將陸續撤退，長春軍調分部共方，亦決定將東北小組人員撤退至哈，聞長春分部政府與美方人員十九日已得到共產黨參謀長，伍修權之通知，同時政府方面亦考盧東北小組政府人員撤退問題。</p>
<h3>曲阜共軍　搗毀聖廟</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十九日電〕曲舉共軍刻將聖廟聖像盡行搗毁，民衆深表憤慨。</p>

<h3>蘇北共軍擴大攻勢　由漣水沭陽侵入宿遷縣境</h3>

<h3>彭部長答記者問　國大共黨民盟代表席次決予保留　綏靖區政務會議今閉幕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕中宣部記者招待會，廿日下午三時半假國大會黨代表休息室舉行。出席彭學沛，沈怡，葉公超，貝爾及中外記者的兩百人，首由彭氏介紹新任京市長沈怡，出席報告京市初步施政方針，旋答覆記者詢問，至五時許散會。茲誌彭部長答問如次：</p>
<p>間：中共發言人稱：陝北國軍調動頻繁，空中飛機時過延安，西安以北之公路，亦積極整修，謂國軍即將進攻延安確吾？</p>
<p>答：此種空氣或爲宣傳策略，且爲有行動之先聲，此與中共新成立之行動委員會，不無關係。榆林被包圍已數週，聯絡唯靠空軍，故須經過延安上空。至於整修公路，乃全國性者，西安以北之交通不能除外。</p>
<p>問：請坦白相告政府是否正計劃進攻延安？</p>
<p>答：前題已有否定之回答。</p>
<p>問：傳聞蔣主席近召集各地國軍高級將領開會，席上並稱五個月消滅共軍，五年肅淸中國之共產主義，確吾？</p>
<p>答：此傳聞或係對最近所開之綏靖區政務委員會會議，該會以宋院長，白部長爲正副委長，任務爲策劃綏靖區之復員與救濟，出席者有中央各有關部會人員及各綏靖地區之軍政長官，並非召集所有高級將領開會，如陳總長即未出席，主席曾至該會訓話，但對訓話內容之如此臆測，實無否定之價値。該會已繼續三日，廿一日即將閉幕。</p>
<p>問：主席曾與張君勱交換文件知否？</p>
<p>答：書札往還，乃平常事，唯可相告者，即民社黨出席國大一點，有極大可能。回溯民國廿七年首屆參政會成立，會中份子除無黨無派者外，以國民黨，共產黨，靑年黨，民社黨（曩稱國社黨）四黨爲主，嗣民主同盟成立，乃以靑年黨，民社黨爲主幹，而摻以敎育團體及少數個人，目前情形恰與廿七年相似，反對參加國大者，僅共產黨，吾人對敎育界，無黨無派人士及蒙　同胞之出席國大，共同制憲，極感愉快，與會代表對彼等亦自爲歡迎</p>
<p>問：司徒美堂領導之民治黨，是否在國大獲得席决？</p>
<p>答：司徒先生已以僑民資格被邀出席國大。</p>
<p>問：共產黨及民盟旣不參加國大，政府是否以其席次分配其他各黨？</p>
<p>答：否。共產黨及民盟之代表席次，絕對予以保留。</p>
<p>問：國府委會之改組，是否已進行？</p>
<p>答：各黨派參加國大之工作尚未完或。</p>
<p>問：國大代表中有遷都北平之議，聞京市參議員聆訊後，集議反對之，準備遊行請願，確吾？</p>
<p>答：未聞此訊，陳議長裕生亦從未提及此事。（葉公超·沈怡兩氏談話，見第二版）</p>

<h3>中英通商條約商訂中　我方正研究對稿　政府尚未接收大連市</h3>
<p>葉公超答記者問</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕外交部歐洲司長葉公超，廿日午後於中外記者招待會上，對大述近况，中·英商的交涉，及中·法越南協完實施談判情形，有所報告，茲將問答　誌如次；</p>
<p>問：北平電傳蘇軍已自大連撤退，由中共軍隊接收，蘇軍是否已撤，大述情形如何，中國政府有何消息？</p>
<p>答：關於此事，中國政府並米接到報告，蘇聯政府曾於本年五月廿三日照會吾國，謂蘇軍已於五月三日自東北撤退完畢，自彼時起，大連方面不當再有蘇軍駐防，因去年八月所簽中·蘇條約，並不允許蘇聯在大連駐兵也。大連附近地區，仍爲共軍所佔，中國政府未接收大速，故無其他消息。</p>
<p>問：中·英商的交涉之情况如何？</p>
<p>答：中·英商訂通商及有關條約，英國方面於六個月前曾向中國政府提出一切初稿，外部現正研究對稿，對稿中若干條款，涉及政府其他有關部門，各方正就有關條款研究中。外部期於本月底以前對此對稿完成，惟因牽涉廣泛，可能略費時日。然中國政府與英國政府，固同樣希望該的早日完成。</p>
<p>問：關於中·法越南交涉，前滇省參會曾提出六點意見，不悉中法越南協定實施談判情形如何？</p>
<p>答：中·法談判，可分四要點叙述：（一）收回滇越鐵路滇段，乃政府一貫政策，政府對外交涉，一向重視各方意見，雲南省參議會之意見，自爲政府所重視。（二）海防關爲自由港問題，政府正與法方交涉中，已獲有眉目，絕對可望成功。（三）戰時越境公私物資損失，正交涉賠償，因涉及調查，估價，幣値訂定等問題，將費時間較久。（四）華僑保障問題，政府正密切注意中，同時，政府並與法越雙方交涉，俟交涉獲有結果，則實施之後，華僑非僅可獲得保障，且可享受較前較佳之待遇，此則可斷言者。</p>

<h3>社論　樹立民族的新風範</h3>
<p>自立法院因程序問題暫停審議憲草修正案後，各方對於憲草問題，寄予莫大之關注。憲草修正案的擬訂，原本基於政協的決議，是項修正案的是否將被提出國大，不特有關政府的信義，抑且有關整個大局的前途。爲此，本報前曾若論，對憲草問題有所論列；認爲三民主義憲法的草訂，沒有成規可循，一切事屬首創。五五憲草的制擬，前曾化了極大的努力，固然充分反映了三民主義的精神，但其所定的制度，鑒於近十年來，尤其是最近幾年來的演變，是否最合理想，要亦不無疑問。至此次政府所擬提交國大的修正憲草，於遵守政協決議之中，仍舊一本三民主義的嚴正立塲，應該可爲國大制憲的依據。至於程序問題，祇要中常會一有決議，未始不能及時使其合於規定。</p>
<p>現在憲草修正案果經巾常會通過，交立法院迅予完成立法程序，同時又通過了國府組織法修正案；國防最高委員會也通過了行政院組織法修正案；各案內容，又均遵照政協決議精神。此項議案的通過，一方面固然可以使立法院之審議憲草修正案，得以合乎法定的程序，及時審議完竣提付國大；一方面却又在昭示國人，就是政協所通過的決議，政府對之如何遵守信義決意採行。一切無稽之談，觀乎中常會此次的決議，當可不攻自破。政府重視它自己所作的諾言，自不輕易許其有所變更。除非在茲本的立塲以外，中央的不持己見，實在應該感動各黨各派乃至無黨無派的人士。「相信我們的主義，纔能做我們的國民」這種不合時宜的觀念，雖或不免依舊存留於若干人之腦際，但決不能代表一個一本天下爲公的政團。這是那些表面上揚言提倡民主，實際上無個人自由崇尚集權主義的政團。纔有這種可怕的觀念。</p>
<p>中常會所通過的國府組織法修正案，除國府主席由中常會選任外，置國府委員四十人，包括黨內外人士，並將國府委員會的權力予以擴大；同時國防最高委員會所通過的行政院組織法修正案，除交通改設運輸郵電兩部，新設地政，水利，衛生三部外，又設政務委員。凡此決議，悉運政協決議精神；長政府之決意遵守並實行政協的決議，於此可見。由於此項修正案的通過，國府及政院的改組，以容納各黨各派乃至無黨無派的人士，必能加速進行。我們願各方人士能從此更加精誠合作，使國府及政院的組織，能够更加充實，以樹立民主統一的新風範，民族前途，從此又增加其光明。</p>
<h3>整飭邊政不容忽視</h3>
<p>當國內的局勢，因國大的召開而呈着新機運的時候，我們不要忽視了來自邊疆的消息與意向。日前國大內蒙代表，參政會全體內蒙參政員曁其它蒙疆人士，在京集會，發表宣言，要求自治，並請中央澈底實行二中全會對邊政的決議案，刷新邊政。同時，據美國聯合社自洛杉磯傳來的消息，又謂新疆纏回，近又蠢蠢欲動，「東土耳其斯坦人民井和國」的舊夢，又有死灰復燃之勢。此項報道，來自太平洋彼岸的洛杉磯，其眞確的程度如何，不無可疑。照我們的判斷，前項報道，不免有張大其辭之處，未必可信；但旣有如上的報道，也着實値得我們的警惕。　我們之應該重視我們的邊政，是無須我們加以强調的。新疆蒙古爲我國北方及西北方的屏藩，當茲時會，允應値得我們的注意。蒙疆在過去八年中，有的曾遭淪陷，飽嘗日本軍閥侵略的苦味，迨日寇投降，又遭國軍以外的武裝部隊及中共的統治。所以當他們正慶山河的重光，郤又遭受了另一暴力統治的惡遝；因此，對於蒙疆同胞，我們應該表示萬分的同情和慰藉。中央關注邊民，在去歲日本投降以後，曾有蒙旂宣慰團的派遺。由於最近局勢的發展，蒙疆一帶不免蒙受了不安的影響。從外國通訊社傳來的消息，一則謂外蒙眾隊刻正向察省邊界一帶集中；再則謂外蒙軍事常局，現正採取嚴格措施，防止任何人自察省越過邊界而入外蒙。此項消息的眞確性雖尚有待於證實，然蒙邊情勢的不安，似乎無可加以否認。</p>
<p>正在這個時候，我們郤看見有蒙古人士要求自治的呼聲。據報載消息，蒙古同胞的要求自治，並不在分裂，而在要朮政府實踐三番五次對蒙古人民所作的諾言。我們相信這句話的　出於蒙旂同胞的肺腑。蒙旂同胞隔戈壁與外殲相望，對於外蒙的實情，知之較切，加以中共的暴力統治，他們也知之有素；所以他們的心理內向，而不在分裂，我們贊佩蒙旂同胞能够有這樣坦白的表示。中央對於　政的關注，在二中全會原有重要的決議，一則曰在根據三民主義，五　憲法組成統一民主國家之原則下，憲法中須明白現定保障邊疆民族之百治極利；再則曰改組後之國府委員及行政院之政務委員，均須有　·藏·回三族忠實幹續之同參加；再則　，蒙·藏·回三族賢能人士，須有充分機會參加各院部會實際工作；再則曰改組蒙藏委員會爲邊政部，使蒙·藏·回三族幹練人士得參加實際工作，担負實際責任；再則曰在邊疆民族所在地各級之施敎，應注重本族文字，對於邊疆各地自治制度，須按照各該地實際情形，作合理之規定，其關於內蒙部份，恢復原有之蒙古地方自治政務委員會，並明白劃分盟旂政府與省縣界之權限。凡此決定，本報曩曾著論，有所評述，認爲「這次國民黨二中全會的決議，於擴大邊地同胞參加中樞的機會外，着重在扶殖邊地同胞的自治，與維護邊地同胞的自治，與維護邊地同胞的固有文化生活，不特足以表示中央對邊地同胞的關注，抑亦爲他們此後的發展開拓了一條大道」。可遺憾的是二中全會以後，國內的局勢，依舊未能趨於平靖，致前項決策未能實行；如今局勢旣有變更，而蒙胞又有自治的要求，籲請中央實行決策。我們上體中央關注邊民的德意，同情蒙胞的遭遇，因此，希望能將二中全會關於邊政的決議，一一及時逐漸付諸實施，以慰邊民喁喁之望。</p>
<p>至於關於新疆部份，從美國傳來的消息，未必可信，前已言之。但我們於此不能不再有所申說的就是中央本革命之三民主義，爲期調協邊民安定疆圉起見，於本年一月間旣有伊寧糾紛事件和解條款正文十一條之簽訂，於本年六月間復成立附文二件，同時又擴大新疆省政府之組織，由居住新疆各族分任委員；又見中央對於邊民自治，盡力扶持，凡邊民願望之可以得能滿足者，均使其得到滿足。此種開明政策，應爲邊民所共戴；則如何協和各族，消除猜忌，以臻衷誠合作，當爲新疆各族一致努力的中心。茲因有前項報道的傳來，用特重申我們的所見；願國人其共勉之。</p>

<h3>公共汽車激動乘客咒詛</h3>
<p>戰後的南市已被砲火洗刦得相當的可憐，但是目前已經有幾處在興建新屋住家和店舖亦較前增多，因之市面漸復繁榮。市政當局爲了便利市民交通，因有行駛公共汽車設備，一般薪給員工及勞工階級的民衆，莫不欣悅稱便。可是近來時聞傳說，該項汽車來時必四五輛銜接而來，且到站未曾開門即疾駛而去，使久候乘客未能上車。</p>
<p>上月某日筆者適由總工會會議畢，頗覺疲憊，步抵小北門時擬搭六路車，詎料候至十五分鐘左右，未見有車駛來，正在不耐煩時，遙見三五輛同時駛來，待車抵站時，第一輛因車中已滿載乘客，故車門未開即行駛去，第二輛車未停穩，乘客蜂擁車門前，車廂內乘客較前車爲稀，駕駛員和賣票員都嚷着「後面有空車子」，言未竟，車已開動，於是一般乘客均紛紛趨向後面幾輛車子，車廂裏當然較前二輛空得多，可是售票員不的而同地嚷着「後面空」「後面空」，一方面把呌子一吹，三輛車子飛也似地尾追而去了，一般乘客均表示出失望和憎恨的樣子在詛咒着；「他媽的！老子自己會走」，「跑吧，跑吧」，有幾個不耐煩等候的一面詛咒着一面跑了。　天色漸漸地暗下來，筆者好得傍晚返家，閒　無事，索性再等一等，同時抽這當口看看路旁修理三輸車的純熟的小技工作，極作無聊中消遺品，不知不覺地又等下了十多分鐘，遠遠地接連開到四輛，第一第二輛乘客擠得滿滿的，故米停車即行開去，第三第四輛較空，車未停穩乘客已爭先恐後地向車門前擁住，可是照舊的售票員用手指指向後面，口中呼着「後面空車子來了」，結果第三第四輛文未開門就開去了，這時候維者亦未免暗暗地太息了一聲，接連地又聽到乖客們謾罵不已；「中國人辦的事總是辦不好的」，這句話使人聽「太傷心了！筆者雖是一個小小的公務員，但是絕圣水願勝利後的老百姓對國營的事業仍有這樣輕視的惡　！所以提出下面幾點意見，希望趙局長及車務間負責人員加以注意和改良。（一）車輛銜接而駛同時抵站，是否售票員有使查票員首尾不及兼顧之作用？（二）車廂內旣有空餘地位，抵站時爲何不開門容納乘客。（三）老西門爲起站點，管理派車者爲何不勻配相隔時間而使數輛同時開出？（四）在這中外交通工具競爭的上海，駕駛員和售票員對乘客們的禮貌，應有改進一的必要，倘無相當的訓練，與洋商所辦的無優劣分別，則每天乘客改乘洋商車輛的漏巵，日積月累，不能說不是國家的損失。（五）最好能指派幾位流動的稽查員，車事查察　駕駛員及售票員是否守職並可給予乘客們上車下車時的　願。（六）任何事業對於生活上沒有相當的報酬，流弊和不忠職務的事情很易發生，所以對於服務人員的待遇亦應該合理化，否則即使能將以上數點改善，亦不過是一個治標而不治本的辦法，因爲工作效率是　於工作情緒，而服務精神是寓於服務興趣的（章致）</p>
<p>回溯八一三滬戰猝發，日寇於金山衛海口乘隙登陸（是年十一月五日），東南半壁，幾全淪陷於敵寇之手。所以痛定思痛，似應以金山衛海防之潰退爲最創鉅痛深。按金山衛城爲明繼戚光防倭所築，不意三百餘年後　一日寇破門竄入。故爲警惕國民重視海防精練海軍計，爲紀念此次抗戰所遭受之重大損害計，爲追悼因金山衛突然失守而被犧牲之人命財產計，似均應有所表示。或於我國之大都市中指定一道路，定名爲金山衛路，（以上海之街道易名爲最妥）或於金山衛城附近日寇首先登陸之處，建立碑事，以資警惕而備紀念，均有深長意義者也。（公度）</p>

<h3>聯全國全體大會通過　停止宗教種族歧視</h3>
<p>顧維鈞闡明孔子哲學博得全場鼓掌</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日專電〕聯大會今日首次舉行五十四國之投票，並一致通過埃及提出之決議案，請各國政府「立即停止宗教上及所謂種族上迫書與歧視」。反對者僅南非總理史未資一人，渠於大會討論決議時，獨立一旁，冷然閱報，蓋以印度會對南非提出種族歧視之證賣也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十九日電〕聯合國大會本日開會，討論埃及對於種族上與宗教上之歧視所提出之議案。埃及代表奧迪安首先發言稱，埃及所提出之議案，實可視爲「善勝惡這象徵」，波關代表對之，率直表示附議，並謂波蘭蒙受種族上歧視，痛苦備　。蘇聯代表即該國外次維辛斯聲亦竭力贊成此項議案，但謂此項議案過於抽象，並不能指出反對排斥之實際辦法。至此中</p>
<p>維鈞博士起立發言稱，埃及代表所提出之議案，與聯合國憲章完全符合，中國代表團對此，完全表示贊同。此項議案雖未有任何具體之規定，但現仍有許多國家未能尊重人類平等之觀念，故中國代表對於埃及之義案，表示無限歡迎。至於中國則在五千年以前，早已尊重人類平等。一原則，時至今日，亦將此等原則，付儲實施。中國境內有漢滿蒙回藏五種不同之民族，其所信仰之宗教，足以代表全世界所有之宗教，但仍能和平相處，相安無事，實乃中國能實施人類平等之原則有以致之。中國至　先師孔子之　有曰，「四海之內皆兄弟也」，吾人無時不以孔子之遺教爲念，切實遵行，深望大會能一致通過埃及所提出之議案。蘇代表維　斯甚表示蘇聯雖將投票成該案，惟覺該案之未能列舉事實國名，復未建議防止歧視行之具，　措施，實爲美中不足。美代表奧斯汀英代表蕭克羅斯亦相繼發言，支持該決議案。　氏並表示擁護維辛斯　之意，指出僅有言辭及決議案，猶嫌未足，故英國常盡力於太屆大會中完成人權委員會，以規定人類基本權利之法典。印代表則謂，此項議案，因其爲確定人類不問其爲白種人黑種或黃種人間完全平等之一大步驟，深望此項議案能獲得一致通過，並望各國代表返國後，能研究其本國之情形，而設法覓致方法，以補救任何現行之歧視。最後由法代表巴洛迪發言稱，法代表國對此義案表示贊同，但余欲告各位，法國從未容許任何種族上的歧視，此等歧視，與法國人民之精神絕不相符云。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十九日電〕聯合國大會本日選出哥倫比亞，叙利亞及比利時爲安理會非常任理事國，任期兩年。「聯大」全會並選舉委內瑞拉及紐西蘭爲社會經濟理事會理事國，任期三年，美國及黎巴嫩亦獲重選連任。經社理事會尚缺二席，惟因投票結果未足三分之二，四候選國（土本其·荷蘭·白俄羅斯及南斯拉夫）均未獲選。大會主席斯巴克遂宣佈留待下次全會決定。由於本日選舉結果，明年安理會十一理事國將爲：五常任理事國（美·英·中·蘇·法）及澳洲，巴西及波蘭（上述三國任期於一九四七年年終屆滿）與今日選出之哥倫比亞，叙利亞及比利時。明年經社理事會理事國將爲：古巴，捷克·印度·挪威·蘇聯·英國（任期於一九四七年年終屆滿）比利時·加拿大·智利·中國·法國·秘（於一九四八年年終屆滿）及今日選出之四國（美國·委內瑞拉·黎巴嫩及紐西蘭）及尚未選出之兩國，其任期均止於一九四九年終。</p>
<p>印度落選</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約二〕十日電〕安理會當選三理車國，係經秘密投票選出者。據悉，印度曾極力要求在安理會中獲得一席，以代替埃及，且得中蘇英三國之支持，但印度僅得十三票，居第四位終爲落選。選舉結果表示安理會之份子仍保持已往區域分配辦法，哥倫比亞代表拉丁美洲，叙利亞代表阿拉伯集團，比利時代表西歐諸國。哥倫比亞係繼墨西哥之任，叙利亞繼埃及，比利時繼荷蘭。在實際選舉舉行前，尚經過甚多之幕後活動，其結果早已預定，選舉僅使其例行手續而已。</p>

<h3>美煤礦工潮　國內外影響重大</h3>
<p>〔聯合社畢資堡十九日電〕聯邦法院雖下令禁止烟煤礦罷工，但罷工者陸續增多，昨日已有三萬八千名罷工，今日又有四萬名罷工，兩共七萬八千名左右。煤礦停閉者有二七二所，煤斤產量因而每日减少百分之二十。鋼鐵廠燃料供給開始停頓，各該廠一部份礦穴亦在罷工之列。全國煤礦是否開始總罷工，須至廿一日分曉。礦工聯曾主席會易斯已通告政府，聲明工會合同於是日期滿，自罷工禁令發出以來，魯易斯迄未有何表示。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕陸軍部今日宣布：準備與內政部合力干涉煤礦工潮，惟截止自前爲止，尚未接得陸軍出動通知。</p>

<h3>日戰犯物證陣述　恐不能如期結束</h3>

<p>〔改造社東京十九日電〕在戰後通貨膨脹的巨浪中，日本學生爲繳納學費及維持生活，尋覓職業者，日益增加。有一技之長者，不愁沒有出路。目前東京各舞塲樂隊由各大學學生組成者，竟有十七隊之多，每人月收達一萬六千元至二萬元，頗爲月薪尚不及千元之公敎人員等　水階級所羨嘉。據慶應大學音樂部學生大橋談稱：今年四月起，學生之組織樂隊者漸多，渠每日一時至四時半在白木屋舞塲，下午五時半至九時在雅園舞塲，月收多時達二萬元以上。惟將來是否完全拋棄學業，以此事爲職業，抑或繼續學業而以此事爲副業，尚難決定，認眞考慮前途殊堪憂慮云。</p>

<h3>英人心目中的中國</h3>
<p>— 本報駐英記者朱尊諸寄</p>
<p>從中國來的消息固然不利，然而英國輿論界對中國的論調並不算壞。倫敦泰晤士報每天都刊有中國消息，每隔一二月，發表關於中國問題的社評一篇；每年雙十節，泰晤士報都著論分析中國時局。泰晤士報立論公正，對中共的非法妄行時有指摘。其他的倫敦報紙很少刊載中國新聞，偶爾登一兩則，十九都是小報或晚報作風。譬如中國人吃什麼，穿什麼之類，小姐們穿旗袍之類的照片，便常出現於各報閒話　或點滴欄內。新聞紀事報從前因爲蓋爾德的關係，曾經登過不少關於中國的文章，蓋爾德替中共吹噓，但他本人並非同情中共，實際上是因爲他在重慶時，和幾位發言人閙遇意見，因之竟對整個中國政府發生反感，反感至極時，竟大爲中共帮腔。紀事報現在對中國的看法已漸爲改正，他們的政論家巴特萊氏即將訪華，巴氏的世界政治眼光一向爲英國人所推崇，他對九一八事變的看法和中國的觀點完全一致。一向被國人認爲同情中國的曼撤斯特導報所刋登的中國消息很少，偶而有一篇社評，其論調也不見「同情」。</p>
<p>英國雜誌對華毀響兼有，週刋裏最有地位的「經濟學者」對中國常有論述，關於中國通貨膨脹，很不客氣的指出了內戰爲一切罪惡的根源。此次，左派的「新政治家與民族」週刋，對中國的論調有些近乎「新華」「解放」，其立塲盡人皆知，正如每日工人報（英共黨機關報）的言論之不爲人所重視完全一樣，中共對外宣傳最成功的一點，是他們所謂的「農民運動」，大吹其在邊區的减租和其他土地改革政策。一般英國報紙，連泰晤士報在內，都認爲中共對道個迫切的社會問題頓有辦法。</p>
<p>英國人對香港問題大體都不關心，有一部份人很願意把這塊島地交還中國，反對量力的還是那一般「老中國」。英國內的人民所最不瞭解的是：爲什麼在香港的中國人對英國人的惡感如是之深？這點懷疑非常自然，因爲在英本國的英國人不知道在殖民地。在半殖民地。以及在次殖長地的英國人的生活態度——帝國主義者的驕橫。這般帝國主義者在國外耀武揚威，目空一、切、回到國內，則態度改變，和普通富有幽默感的英國人一樣。</p>
<p>英國人對中國的瞭解不够，我國對外宣傳當局固應注意，但單靠宣傳是不够的，要一個民族認識我們，介紹文化生活是一個途徑；但當前國內大局之有待澄淸，却是第一件事。誰都知道中國歷史悠久，文化偉大，但若從這個偉大的文化背景裏所透露路出來的，盡是惡劣的消息。外國人心裏的大問號，便永遠也不會消除的。（完）</p>
<h3>英「叛黨」風潮雖告平息　政局仍未許樂觀　反對派佔全院三之一強　工黨內部實際分裂如故</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕下院昨夜雖以三三五對零票，表決信任政府現行外交政策，但工黨議員有一百六十名朱投票，除患病及其他原因者外，至少有工黨議員一百人於表決時毫無表示。其比例之高，即使政府自稱勝利，亦不得不感困惱。參加表決之議員人數中，工黨二百三十人，保守黨一百零四人，自由黨七人。各小黨十二人。據擁議政府者稱，信任案之表決足以昭示世界，英國民意實擁護貝文外長，但批評者則謂、棄　議員人數之多，足證工黨政策實際上分裂如故，絕未因此而得補救。叛黨行動有再發生之可能。此種危機，政府未便漠視，遽謂一切風平浪息，未免過於樂觀。叛黨議員說明其　　原因，係由於不能即以此種表決解釋爲對政府普遍的不信任，例如對政府所行內政政策實全部贊同，甚至對於某某部份之外交政策，亦無一異議。因此，政府在下院獲得大多數信任，不外出於下列二種原因：（一）在內政方面，工黨似團結如故；（二）外交方面保守黨與工黨忠實份子一致擁護政府。</p>

<h3>京滬傳真電報開放　收發圖收照像不爽絲毫　報費分五萬二萬元兩種</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬間電傳眞蹟電報，業於昨日正式開放，文字圖照，傳一　均極淸晣。上海電信局之電傳眞蹟電報機，早已裝竣，試騐完成。南京方面亦於昨日試騐完成。昨日開放後由交通部俞部長拍致吳市長之眞蹟電報文曰：「上海吳市長國楨兄勳鑒，本部對交通各部門業務，正致全力以求改進，關於電訊革新方面，長途電話已採用超短波無綫電機，電報已試用打字電報機，並開辦特快電報，力求通訊能迅速準確，現又在京滬兩地試辦傳眞電報，今際開辦之始，敬電伸臆，諸惟惠察。弟俞大維，十一月二十日」。</p>
<p>吳市市長復俞部長電文曰：「南京交通部俞部長大維兄勳鑒，頃奉哿電，祇悉吾兄接長交通部以來，精思竭慮，致全力於交通事業之改進，採用新式電機，試辦傳眞電報，公私事業頃刻即達，使全國成一家，繫東西爲一處，推行各地，指日可期，引企新　，彌深燕賀，謹電奉復。弟吳國楨戍哿秘」</p>

<h3>參觀試騐</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕京滬無綫電傳眞，經兩地電訊人員數月之努力，已告試騐成功，正式開放。記者今晨至南京電訊局收報台參觀，由該台主任雷大華親自試騐京滬電傳並加說明。先由上海拍一表格至京，綫條與字跡皆甚淸晣，南京亦有書寫之文件傳至上海，十二吋寬，八吋高之紙張，八分鐘即可傳畢。據談：目前因一部份機件尚未裝就，傳遞照片，恐不甚淸晰，惟傳遞其他眞蹟，不問其係鋼華或墨筆書寫，甚至藍圖，皆字字可認，情况若好，五號大小之鉛字亦可一一傳出，並以試騐成績出示，若干與普通印刷品無大差異</p>
<p>京滬電訊局目前所用之電傳機，係美國西聯公司一九四二年出品，運抵中國者共四部，其中兩部現在南京，兩部在上海，不久將運一部至北平。此種機器較現在渝昆所用者爲新式，可同時收發，且有自動設備，不若前者之麻煩不便。定購期極早，前因戰事關係，曾在印存放多時，最近始由重慶轉輾運京。由於一再遷播，加之每部重達三噸，運京時頗多損毀，需加修理，所以遲遲始能開放者，其故即在此。</p>

<h3>佘山洋面午夜起火　海天號輪幾釀禍災　押貨員失檢船上草料引起燃燒　派輪施救後昨晨已續駛秦皇島</h3>
<p>國營招商局行駛上海秦皇島綫之巨型自由輪海天號，於十九日午夜十二時許，啓椗離滬。駛抵吳淞口外佘山洋面，突然起火，當由海關巡船聞警趕往施救，旋告撲滅，艙面稍受損害，該輪於昨日侵晨已駛往秦皇島。事後據華東社記者向招商局方面獲得眞相如下：據該局於前夜自無綫電中接獲海天輪起火報告，當即派員趕往調查，關於該輪起火原因，係以載運貨物中有易於引火之草料之而搭乘之押貨人員失檢，遂使草料燃燒，幸經船員會同海關巡船員　竭力施救，即告撲滅，唯有押貨員兩人灼傷，已於昨晨由該局以急救船載來上海送入醫院救治，無生命之處。又悉海天輪爲該局最大型之自由輪，載重噸位達一萬餘噸，此次係開往秦皇島載運煤斤來滬者。</p>
<h3>招商局登陸艇　萬縣附近擱淺　貨物受潮船員旅客無恙　法輸松旦號迄今未駛出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局中字華字之登陸艇，均派駛滬渝，因該項登陸艇，吃水旣淺，速率又快，故行駛以江長爲適宜。據悉：華字二百十號登陸艇，於本月十三日自渝載貨下水，於翌晨九時許，在萬將附近石寳塞處觸礁擱淺，頭艙洞穿，江水浸人，貨物受潮，幸船員旅客無恙。該艇即發電求救，宜昌分局接電，旋派駁船前往施救，總局得報後，亦派華字二〇八號登陸艇馳往拖救，茲據該艇報告，近日江水逐漸减退，昨日二百十號艇船頭僅尺許，後稍的二尺餘，雖將食米等貨起出，但船身觸人礁石，依然不能浮起，故一時無法拖曳，現正繼續施救中。</p>
<p>法輪戰後首次來滬之松且號，於上月二十九日抵埠，原定本月十四日離滬返法，因在滬略加修理，改期於十六日起椗，詎船員忽提出要求，致未能開出，直至十八“猶未解決，該公司即電巴黎總公司請示，迄接覆，故該輪返法期，猶未確定。至乘客除法僑返法者外，一部份係香港旅客，業已退票改乘他輪。該公司正班郵船安得來蓬號，上月十五日由馬賽起程來華，　計本月底可到滬。</p>

<h3>哈同遺產糾紛　國籍問題將爲爭執焦點　管理處堅持哈同爲英籍　十二伊拉克人決定起訴</h3>
<p>〔木報訊〕哈同遺產，近由伊拉克近親族十二人，派代表來滬，再興訟事分析遺產一節，許情已載十一日本報，茲據哈同遺產管理處方面表示：哈同雖原籍伊拉克，但歸化英國爲衆所週知之事實，當時英駐滬領事館曾發給護照，即爲强有力之證據。但十二近親族則堅稱：哈同並未依合法手續取得英國國籍，亦能提出證據。故哈同國籍問題，將爲遺產案中雙方爭執之焦點。現該十二人所考慮者，在訴訟標的之多寡，哈同遺產照現値的略佔計，當在法幣五百億元以上，若以此數爲訴訟標的，則訴費當需六億五千萬元之鉅。哈同遺產大部爲房地產，的三十餘處，總面積四百餘畝，及慈淑，哈同兩大樓，目前地產收人已大不如昔，哈同之全部房地產月入僅四千餘萬元，喬治哈同曁羅友蘭等于十餘人，每月每人不過分得二百餘萬元，故咸認爲十二伊拉克人耗費鉅額訟費，從事毫無一把握之官司，實爲不智。而十二伊拉克人則認爲權利所在，不能不爭，且有充分法律根據，故將於日內投狀地院起訴云。</p>

<h3>十五影劇人　高院今偵訊　昨日審查兩偽片　當塲對存意見書　當局希望被檢舉者　尊重司法應傳報到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市高等法院檢察處，定於今晨九時繼續開庭偵查附逆嫌疑影劇人。此次第二批被傳者爲李　華，陳雲裳，陳燕燕，梅熹，柳中浩，張石川，徐欣夫，周詩穆，卞　英，史廷磐，胡晋康，金龍章，張消還，鍾寳璇，伍仲山　十五人，但因一部份傳票未能送達，故屆時恐有多人不能到庭。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市淪陷期間，電影戲劇界人員，頗多留滬工作者，勝利後，檢舉附逆影劃人員問題，討論甚爲熱烈，但未見結果，迄至最近，突有某機關開列名單數十人，向高等法院檢察處提出檢舉，現正由該處分批傳詢偵查中。此舉使昔日留滬之影劃人員，惶惶不可終日·影響所及，幼萌於始之電影事來幾致陷於停頓。市黨部爲明辦是非，無枉無從，使電影從業員安心工作起見，特聯合各有關機關社團，於昨晨假座滬光大戰院放映「春江遺恨」，「葛世流芳」兩僞片，加以審查。到有市黨部方治，謝仁釗，孫東城，徐鳴亞，市政府王冠靑，中宣部羅學濂，敎育局李熙謀，彭振球，社會局陳愼修，夏景濤，電影檢查處杜桐蓀，江濱，靑年團吳華盛，軍之友社劉德銘，中電朱人義，地檢處梁賡舜，楊守年，上海市文化運動委員會張澈及各報記者共三四十人。高檢處負責偵查附逆影劇人員案之瞿鎔檢察官亦偕書記官參加。九時先演「春江遺恨」休息十分鐘，再映「萬世流芳」。待完畢已一時半。參加審查者，均獲有意見表一紙。各書對兩片意見，以不具名方式匯集後當塲封存。送往高檢處作爲偵查之參攷。</p>
<p>觀後感</p>
<p>市黨部方主委於觀後談稱：「萬世流芳」攝於「春江遺恨」之先。此爲歷史片，在當時日人武力統治之下，能說「中國人不會做亡國奴的」話，直覺了不得。大概日人對「萬世流芳」不感滿意，乃有「春江遺恨」之　。且有日人參加。該片可注意者即字幕出現時，必日人在先，國人在後。而劇悄出於造。據余所知日本攘夷運動與太平天國無聯帶關係云。市黨部書記長謝仁釗亦謂：「萬世流芳」叙述林則徐禁烟抗英之事，當時英帝國主義確係如此行爲，而各地亦確有平英團等組織。故該片應分兩點請，一就叙述歷史言，無可非　。二就際關係言，因今日與一英國爲盟國，則似相有問題。關於「春江遺恨」日人同情太平天國之結，歷史上似無此記載。日人之强調，國使國人對其發生好感而已耳。</p>
<p>方主委於參加觀片者塡註審查意見前稱：希各人本客觀立塲批評，並望被檢舉者依傳向法院報到，一切尊重司法云。</p>

<h3>清除全市積柩　衛生局限期明春遷移出境　逾期將分區集中火葬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕衛生局爲改善本市環境衛生，決將本市各區殯儀館寄柩所及空塲囑地等處之積柩予以澈底淸除，原定有主棺木限期年底以前遷移出境，現已寬限至明年三月底，俾事主可有充份時間。過期後存滬棺木一律以無主論，將分區集中火葬。</p>
<p>機悉全市積柩已向衛生局登記者九萬七千餘具，其餘未經登記或暴露於荒地者爲數亦有不少，估計總數在十萬具以上，其中一部份無主者大都已破爛腐朽，息氣四溢，各區區公所因此迭次請求將該項破棺遷移，現衛生局決定將全市積柩統籌辦理，採用最澈底之火葬辦法，限期實施。今後並將取締寄柩所之設立，殯儀館擱置棺木則以十日爲限，一方面則由政府舉辦運柩所，協助喪戶將棺木運離市區。</p>
<p>此項辦法決定以來，積柩事主頗多以無地無錢，遷葬爲難，呼籲當局多闢公墓，俾可安葬。但據衛生局方面表示清除積柩早具決心，決不能因少數人之困難面影響多數人之環境衛生。至於多闢公墓一節，不合於新都市計劃中提倡火葬减少公墓之原則，且公墓需地以每畝可葬棺一百具計，則十萬具需地一千畝，何况每月尚有平均約六千人之死亡，姑不論市府缺乏鉅款購地，即以土地之使用價値而論亦極不經濟。同時有主棺木與其寄存公厝而支付寄柩費，不如僅費一筆費用運至鄉區安葬而一勞永逸，故衛生局方面希望事主能遵限遷移云。</p>
<h3>存底豐厚銀根緊　美貨看跌不漲　一般相信走私之風難根絕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自進口許可制度宣布後，本市美貨市價並無波動，美貨商塲亦無顧客擁擠之現象。該業人士告記者：本市美貨存底甚多，而銀根甚緊，貨價只跌不會漲。商界人士認爲進口許可制之實施，在短期內不能使美貨市價上揚，惟如實施有成效，則在長期內將發生影響。但是否如此，關鍵仍在走私能否取締一點。大部份人士不相信走私能完全根絕，因走私者均有極大背景與實力，而走私之方式，亦極盡變化之能事。在目前新辦法管制之下，走私情形甚至可能更形猖獗。市塲在此種心理支配之下，美貨市價不致發生波動。</p>
<h3>取締地下錢舖　獎勵市民舉發</h3>
<p>社會局昨奉財政部電令，嚴行取締太市地下錢鋪，並獎勵市民舉　，原令云：「查自物價高漲，市塲利率，隨商業利潤而俱增，乃發生所謂「地下錢舖」者，非法經營銀行業務，並以高利貸放，盤剝取利，擾亂金融，助長投機，莫此爲甚，雖迭經查獲，依照本部管理銀行辦法內所定私設行莊之罰則，勒令停業，處以罰鍰，顧此類錢舖，多屬臨時組合，附設於住宅或商店之內，查獲旣已不易，縱被發覺，處　之後，仍可易地另設，照舊經營核其所爲，顯已觸犯刑章，亟應依法嚴懲，以資禁革。</p>
<p>查刑法第三十三章詐欺背信及重利罪，於第三百四十四條規定：「乘他人急迫輕舉或無經騐，貸以金錢或其他物品，而取得與原本顯不相當之重利者，處以一年以下有期徒刑，拘役，或併科一千元以下罰金」，第三百四十五條規定，「以犯前條之罪爲常業者，處五年以下有期徒刑，得併科三千元以下罰金」，地下錢舖得以猖獗，自保乘人急迫，輕率無經騐，以遂其高利貸放，非法取利之企岡，嗣後凡經查獲此項案件，關於擅設行莊情簡，仍應報部依照管理銀行辦法處罰，至觸犯刑章部份，應併將人犯證件，逕送該管法院，依法州究辦，以資懲儆。請即轉飭所屬一體嚴查此類地下錢舖，並獎勵舉發藉以制止，並應對於工商各業剴切佈告，如雷融通資金，應向合法設立之銀錢行莊，按正當手續辦理，或照章向地方金融機關（省市銀行總分行處）辦理小工業貸一款，免受非法貸款者之重利盤剝（下略）云。</p>
<h3>校長教授　任參議員</h3>
<p>參會再請司法院解釋</p>
<p>關於各級公立學校校長不得兼任省縣市參議員一事，內政部電復稱，「業經司法院解釋有案，本部無權予以更正。」詳情已誌各報。全市市民頗爲注目，尤以有　之參議員在不可得兼之情狀下，研討取捨間題，而候補參議負亦望早日揭曉，以便遞補，惟昨記者特趨訪參議會當局。據稱：該會業已準備再向內政部請轉呈司法院，再爲解釋，其理由有四：（一）各民主國家均無校長，敎授，不得爲參議員之規定，我國旣爲民主國家，自當任其競選參加。（二）本國參政員及國大代表中，亦允許校長教受參加，而無禁例，參議員與參政民國大代表性質相同，當亦不應有不可兼任之規定。（三）公立學校校長，雖爲派任，惟無明確之簡薦委等級別之分，故不可與公務員一槪而論。（四）在全國提倡敎育建國主張尊師重敎之今日，以敎育人士代表民　。不可認爲非是。</p>

<h3>進口商登記須知　陳長桐向各銀行詳細解釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執委會秘書處處長陳長桐，於昨日下午一時，假中國銀行四樓，召集中外各指定銀行負責人談話。陳氏就修正辦法，施行細則，及已發之各種申請表格，詳爲解釋。並對各行所提出之疑問，分別解答。至四時許，始告散會。</p>
<p>該會所發之進口商申請登記須知，及申請表格四種，各指定銀行大多均於昨日上午收到。惟以印刷關係，所發份數，尚不敷應用。各行有分別照式添印者，一俟趕印就緒，即可接受申請。</p>
<p>進口商申請登記須知，共列四項：（一）進口商行，應各注意下列修正進出口貿易暫行辦法第二條：「進口商必須分別按其所經營之業務稱類，向輸入臨時管理委員會申請登記。其登記辦法，由輸入臨時管理委員會另定之。輸入許可之申請人，以業經登記之進口商爲限。（二）按前條之規定，本委員會業經公告如下：「凡有固定之營業地址之行商，在民國卅年十二月八日以前業已營業，或在上項日期以後開始營業，而現爲公認之國外出口廠商之代理人，或能提出一年內之記錄，證明其確有經營輸人貿易之能力者，均得申請登記」。（三）進口商欲按修正進出口貿易暫行辦法第二條之規定申請登記者，應自即日起，兩星期內，塡具表式AR-1「如係輸入附表（二）類貨品，同時並須塡表式AR-1（A）。呈送本委員會秘書處。（四）對於上海以外各埠之進口商其申請登記期限得酌予寬放。</p>
<p>申請表格四種</p>
<p>至申請表格四種，一·係進口商行登記申請書爲AR-1式。二·係過去輸入，按品分類情况表（祗限用於附表（二）類貨品），爲AR-1（A）式。三·係民國卅五年十一月十七日以前業已訂購貨品輸入許可申請書，專供申請附表（一）類貨品之用，爲AL-P2（I）式。該項申精書，須由輸入臨時管委會執委會秘書處處長，及輸入品管理處處長會同簽准。四·係民國卅五年十一月十七日以前業已訂購貨品輸入許可申請書，係供申請附表（一）類以外之一切貨品之用，爲AL-P2（II）式，該項申請書，須由中央銀行外匯審核處處長簽准。</p>

<h3>烚赤盤頭狹窄　美鈔繼續下跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨極形平定，盤頭殊窄，晨開二四九萬八有售，開後一度升至二五〇萬五，求供閑散，買方稍感冷落而告微挫，低價盤跌至二四入萬五光量，央行即以二四八萬五之價，配給六〇條，十時後更爲平穩，午刻在二四九萬光景掙扎，午後人心稍好，報載港市申鈔低落，隔日交割又升至二五〇萬外，結果較前收升一萬，飾金念六萬六，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根尚平，息價自一角二至一角半。</p>
<p>外幣昨更爲鬆濫，買氣不易發動，美鈔暗市自四五五〇元起，再告下落，午刻退至四四二〇元至四四七〇元之間，較前收又跌百元，港票有供少求，電匯不振，結果再跌十元，港匯自九一五元退至九〇五元有供，印匯一一〇〇元有售，英匯自一四八〇〇元退至一四六〇〇元，成交僅港匯稍有成交，餘均沉寂，美匯依然呆滯。</p>
<h3>需要五萬件　配給打六折　棉紗供求問題　外埠及三公會請援便核配</h3>
<p>複製品工業配紗以來，紡管會督導下之配紗，近又有駱駝絨織造，帆布織造，及織帶三業公會，請求紡管會一律核配，據悉可望逖准，且將加入複配會同等辦理，此三業共有會員工廠三百家左右，屬於中小型者居多，需紗量尚屬有限，至染織，針織，內衣，毛巾，被毯，手工棉織，及手帕等業，辦理會員工廠配紗補申報，已編具淸册呈報，今日紡管會開會，當予以考慮，據複配會消息，十一月份之申請總額，原爲四〇·〇一三件，經紡管會決定暫按六折核配，計二萬四千件稍零，分四次配售，明日即爲第四次，數量本屬未足，加以歷次撥配之十支不合粗紗過多，而少數廠家以繳款期促，不及墊款而放棄者，複配會不及移配於缺額之戶，以致大部份缺少細紗，而結果細紗仍有少數退翠，一般廠家，用量愈感不足，其恃存紗以墊補者，其日趨匱乏，紗之供應如無補救辦法，複製工業之减工，勢所難免，複配會負責人潘士浩氏，早經勸告各同業，勿加開機器。勿急於恢復已停工之舊廠，且曾表示棉紗雖有配給，而對於加開及復工之機器，尚無辦法供應，日來各複製工業正在分批調查其會員廠家，嚴格取締浮報，據其最近呈報紡管會之統計，六個複製工業，共有會員廠家一·八八九家，各種織機六六·七二二合，共需各支棉紗四二·三一六件，合二十支標準五一·五二六件，如仍以六折計算，每月當爲三萬件有奇，而在紗廠方面，已嫌太多，而在各複製工廠方面，仍感不足，究應如何統籌調整，各有關方面咸表焦心，又內地之棉紗複製工業，日來亦紛紛請求配給，聞紡管會方面，已加以嚴密注意，據有關方面傳出消息，自配紗機構改組，紗廠之十支紗產量頗有增加，而本市複製業則殊不需此，十支紗之成本較低，利潤較厚，但以可紡二十支之設備，降而改紡十支，亦殊可惜云。</p>
<h3>南運紗布　審核告一段落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會審核各廠商申請南運紗布數額，昨已告一段落。其中除有廿三家，因申請數額逾限，經該會去函囑爲更正外，其餘均已陸續發給准運許可證。又該會以各紗廠前曾兼營運銷商者，曾由請運銷商資格，該會決於今日起，接受申請。</p>
<h3>統債回跌</h3>
<p>公僅昨復平疲，五樓有某大戶脫手，統丙晨開一四五〇元自一五四〇元起，逐步下降，最後退至一四〇〇元以下結束，結果較前收下跌九十元，甲乙戊各降八十元，統丁則跌一百元，成交的四百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>證券業不景氣</h3>
<p>本市股票市塲自開做遞延交易以來，惟以銀根奇緊，且高利貸壓力甚重，仍陌於不景氣狀態，南京路一八〇號證交五十一號經紀人協泰號，於昨晨自動暫停業務，另有數家亦將擱淺。</p>
<h3>外幣不得結匯　央行重申前禁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕進出口貿易辦法修正後，央行曾以六十一號通函，通知各指定經營外匯銀行，將原有規定，略予修正，並廢止第一·廿六·四二·四五及五四（除第六段）各號通函之規定。其中四十五號通函，係規定不得以外幣抵付外既，現經通函廢止，則此後外幣是否可以抵付外匯，殊爲各方所注意，茲悉央行復發出六十二號通函云：自第四五號通函取銷後，各指定銀行仍不得收受外幣，抵付未經央行事先核准之非進口用途外匯。</p>
<h3>油米雜糧　均見疲落</h3>
<p>昨南北米市到源絡續，客貨登記的一萬六千石，店銷動而不旺，南粳貨湧，回小千餘元，北粳中下亦疲三五百元，秈米以產價堅挺，仍居穩定之狀，白元回軟千元，陰元則提高殺次，麵粉廠方供應繼續，人心不振，雜牌再挫一二百元，小麥依然站平，黃豆今日來貨較增，本街零銷尚佳，高俏次呆，芝蔴貨稀穩固，生仁南洋本街均無大宗納胃，交易無幾，市面再見下降三四千元，豆餅閩方汕頭進胃不濃，回小一二百元，油市今日照常交易，豆油賣氣甚盛，回跌三四千元，生油立定。</p>
<h3>漢口帮等大量拋售　豆油竟跌進議價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油新議價，昨日施行，惟油價賡續下跌，緣漢口帮豆油有一二千担拋出，而客商方面，亦頻有吐售，故市價反跌進新議價限度內。各檔食油，平均的較議價小一二千元。豆油爲十三萬一千元，菜油爲十二萬七千元。</p>
<p>昨日各民營廠繼續配油五百担，計大昌新一百担，大有餘一百六十担，長德六十五担，爲民十五担，以上均屬豆油；大生廿担，大德新八十担，以上係菜油；由上海食油聯配處分配予滬西區零售店一百四十二家。該項配油，定今日收款，明日送貨。</p>
<p>又本市各榨油廠，自獲得中央信託局供應大豆後，原料問題可告解法，今日油業方面謝裕祥張超等，將與中信局洽商購辦手續。</p>
<h3>市場開紗起爭執</h3>
<p>布廠進紗困難情願以紗易布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市仍鮮成交，市塲上晨初有永安紗廠擬按公定價賣出廿支金城一百件，申新紗廠亦擬開紗一百件，限老戶頭素有交易者爲對象，旋以業中人提，出異議認爲非持平之道，羣起爭執，兩廠因此暫未開出，蓋粥少僧多，不敷分配也，塲外交易，格於常局功令，未有做開，苦煞一般客帮之急於辦貨者，大有備錢買不到貨之　。</p>
<p>布市目前日吳市長面諭布業代表，注意團格後，已呈穩定，惟以存底太少，一經客帮搜購，價即上升一般織廠更以進紗萬分困難。不願在市塲開售，每多喜以紗易布：俾使原料不致匱乏，此種物物交換辦法，實亦出諸不得已，色布亦因顏料奇緊，價格又貴，故一九〇號士林，日昨又漲起四五千元，龍頭細布現貨做九萬二千，藍鷄細布做九萬元，四君子白印嗶嘰現貨做九萬八千，士林布則爲十四萬五六千元之譜</p>
<h3>橡膠配得八千噸</h3>
<p>生橡膠，除瓊州外，國內向無生產，勝利以來，由聯合國橡膠分配委員會統制，迄未能直接輸入我國，上海市橡膠製品公會，以關係我國橡膠業生存於月前將全國每月需用量三千噸呈請經濟部轉請外交部交涉，頃晤該公會理事長洪念祖氏稱，已奉經濟部批令，准駐美大使館電開：本案經與聯合橡膠分配委員會接治，截至本年底止，中國分配額爲八千噸其中五千噸由英荷屬地及暹遲供給，三千噸由越南供給，此後我國橡膠製品工廠之原料，可無恐慌矣。</p>
<h3>黑市油兩千元　已經查獲將法辦</h3>
<p>〔中央社〕市府當局爲抑平油價，安定民生，業經召集有關各方議定油價限價，並令社會局嚴厲澈查黑市油價，對建章黑市售油之商號嚴加取締，茲悉：社會局昨查獲本市菜市街道德油號黑市售油發票一紙，開價每斤竟達二千元，刻已依法辦理。</p>
<h3>求免稅　皂廠停工</h3>
<p>據本市皂燭業公會理事長梁嵩齡稱：本市製造肥皂之廠商，共有數十家，近來因利息太高，開支太大，以及交通不便銷路被阻等原因，營業大受影響，最近政府又規定肥皂出廠必須繳稅，廠方無法負担，聯合請求行政院豁免，在未獲准以前，暫行停工，但稅局仍須征收，以致未能復工</p>
<h3>美國金條來華</h3>
<p>〔聯合社溫哥華十九日電〕美國金條一批，價值估計爲美金三百萬元，今日已在運赴上海途中，據稱此係美國對華借款之一部份。加拿大輪「阿脫林湖」號今夜載該批黃金啓程駛滬，聞此項黃金係用以補足戰時傳被日本人取去之黃金云。</p>
<h3>南華綫貨運冷落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據航業界消息，最近運輸情况，南華綫閩粵兩省，棉紗棉布禁止運往後，貨運漸見冷落，汕頭厦門偶有肥料雜糧運去，廣州之貨全係零星，即由廣州運來者，亦若寥寥。又悉北洋綫近來貨運大爲起色大宗貨均係紗布，招商局本星期運開三輪，執信輪定今日駛津，蔡鍔輪的明日開津，其美輪預定二十四駛津。又新輪自忠輪，定本星期日開航，駛靑島聞有中紡公司棉花二千噸運去，回程灣連雲港，裝鹽運往長江。</p>
<h3>了結交易居多　華股毫無起色</h3>
<p>華股昨爲遞交最後一日，人心倍現徬禮，求供雙方大都以了結交易居多，市况極爲恍惚，初高繼低，晨開各股先現低價，經二二九號一五一號等買進後，檯面帮買意甚濃，籌碼奇涸，逐步盤漲，十時四十五分後，始由堅轉平，塲外供源陸續告殷，八九號四號一五一號有售，縱有一一一號力購遞永紗，亦無法支持，惟十一時半左右，有八七號一九八號等來進，現永紗二二九號出後復進，低後尚易拉上，終以檯面及浮多爭售，現美亞慘跌甚距，午收復退至新低價，信和永紗現遞價，時有倒掛現象，結果較前收計永紗信和新光各見微降，美亞景福各跌半成，勤興因遞交有望，獨升半成，冷股中紡火柴華豐微升，餘均微挫，遞交永公無交易，餘均微跌，午後僅現交交易，人心不定，二二九號先出後進，開後一度步跌，永紗見五六二元低價後，散戶乖機維持，檯面帮又進，籌碼見涸，逐步扳高，三八號一七六號逢高力售，但買氣甚盛，不過稍形掙扎而已，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福新光微挫，信和稍漲，勤興有遞交之襯托，獨漲一成弱，冷股中紡火柴水泥華豐微升，餘者下跌少許至半成不等，遞交永公無成交，餘者微跌至半成不等，塲外各股稍告下挫。</p>
<p>外股昨市况平穩，各股起仆殊微，過程平庸，結果較前收計怡紗英聯業廣鋼業紙業微挫，航業怡啤曾德豐平穩而已。</p>
<p>全體經紀人昨爲遞交證據金及所佣事，向證交提出要求，聞所方對證據金允呈部請示，對所佣之减低，尚待考慮云。</p>
<h3>出口物資貸款辦法　四聯核准由三行兩局辦理</h3>
<p>四聯總處，前爲協助發展出口貿易，先後核定有打包放款原則，及放寬各行局承做押匯放款辦法，近爲鼓勵出口充分供應資金，對中央銀行所擬辦之出口物資貸款，轉抵押暨轉押匯辦法，業予核准，並轉知各行局辦理，其辦法如次；</p>

<h3>白煤止跌轉穩</h3>
<p>煤市白煤篩塊，逢低盤略有進戶，市勢漸呈平穩。烟煤前因小額同業派貨付款期將屆，無力承購者，祗能廉價出售，市價一度回軟，今因付款期已屆，此批煤斤流出稀少，市價復趨堅悄。煤球球自鴻基屑來源缺乏，各廠配貨减少以來，供應遂告不敷，各煤店均苦於應付，正常可燒煤球，每擔門售價格已升至一萬元。</p>
<h3>中紗白加跌</h3>

<h3>南洋市場　英美已捷足先得　國貨成本太貴運輸困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士告記者：目前我國與南洋各地間之貿易，甚爲不振。過去爲南洋區外貨未到，一時需要甚急，要求貨物之標準亦不高，於是我國之紗布及一部份日用品，遂有相當數量南運。但時至今日，形勢全非。英美商品已大量輸至南洋，而我國之紗布自給不足；商品成本之高，即使運至南洋，亦難打開銷路。運輸又屬困難問題，現航行南洋者，僅有爪哇輪船公司之船隻。數週前，有一南洋商人至滬辦貨，但依舊空手而返，因上海區之高物價，使其不敢落手，至於南洋貨之進口，爲數亦甚稀少，間或有一部份椰子油及橡膠運出，爲數亦不多。僑胞希望國貨甚殷，但祖國實無法滿足其熱望，展望南洋貿易，目前尚難樂觀。</p>

<h3>「倒風」襲擊杭州</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>十日杭州訊</p>
<p>勝利以後，因爲接收機構的錯綜複雜，造成國內工商業的不安狀態，不想國內烽烟迭起，使這脆弱不堪的工商業步入了艱難的窘境。一直到現在，已到了最危險的前夜，在全國各大都會，一片商號行莊的倒閉聲，呌人恐懼戰慄。這分明已是瀕臨工商業崩潰的邊緣，如再不設法救濟，則殆將枯死無疑！</p>
<p>倒風遍及各業</p>
<p>杭州原爲特產外銷的都市，如絲，茶桐油之類，他在往年不僅因特產的外銷而贏得了浙江的豪富，而且亦在國際市塲上爭回不少的榮譽，但是戰後的特產外銷，成了極爲嚴重的問題，國外市塲，已有了代替品或是相同的成品，國內市塲，到處禍亂，又加上通貨貶値，成本過高，外貨傾銷，重利盤剝，捐稅繁重，使特產品處處遇到嚴重的陣碣。於是由勉强維持以至不能維持。由不能維持以至倒閉潰滅的商號行莊，着實有一個很可觀的數字道個倒閉之風彼及於每一個行業，其中尤以茶行爲最，在卅六天的時日中，申報閉歇的已有二十八家。其他閉歇的店號，雖一時尚無精確的統計，但就已呈請市府備案而辦理閉歇手續的營業單位，十月份就有二十四家，如布業五家，娛樂業五家，糧食業一家，電機絲織業一家，洗染業二家，綢商業一家，土紙業八家，雜貨業一家，醃臘業一家，土菸業一家，木排業一家，棉織業一家，如果以金錢數字來說明他的嚴重性，則將在二十萬萬元以上。</p>
<p>茶行倒閉原因</p>
<p>茶行倒閉的原因，據經營該業者言：是爲了政府徽收茶葉貨物稅。浙江的茶在全盛時代，原由浙省征收一種特產稅，後來省政府取銷特產捐，想復甦茶業，長近貨物稅局又征收貨物稅，茶葉正在外銷無路，十分艱窘的時候，受不起這種捐稅的征收，於是相率倒閉。另一種原因爲高利貸的剝削，茶行老闆以高利貸得的款項經營利潤不甚豐厚的茶葉，自然感着有些吃力，反之，如果將經營茶行的資金，來做高利貸，則可少操很多心事。因此，茶業界恐一時不能恢復固有的繁盛。這茶行倒閉的結果，將使茶農所產的茶葉缺少了若干條出路，茶晨又將受到格外的打擊與困苦，另一面，這將近十萬萬以上的資金，變爲游資，在社會上投機作祟。</p>
<p>另外很多商號倒閉的原因，除了爲了高利貸的嚴重剝削和鮮艷的誘惑兩種鉗形夾擊下面停歇號舖外，另種原因，是因爲社會購買力的衰微。公務人員一個月的所得，吃不飽，穿不暖，更何來餘力添辦新的東西？農村破產，工廠岌岌可危，農工同胞也極度缺乏購買的能力，而且因爲高利貸的誘惑，即使有被遺忘而留下來的剩餘購買力，也搖身變作游資，參加高利貸的營壘。因高利貸而獲得財富的人，有的想愈滾愈多，有的雖然購買一些東西，終屬少數之少數。所以在杭州市上，成天價沂見許多商舖張燈結綵，吹吹打打，掛着紅綢綴金字的大廉價旗幟，由春季廉價到夏季廉價，再到秋季冬季的一年四季大拍賣但是生意還遠不如往年平時的熱閙。這種大廉價如果仍舊沒有錢可賺，則繼之也只有倒閉之一途。這樣倒閉的號舖將愈弄愈多，社會上的游資也將愈滾愈多，生產的單位也將愈崩潰愈多了。而外國來的貨物，却源源而來，旣便宜又精巧，我們中國的產品就休想再銷到國外，更因外貨的價廉物美，國內時局的不靖，所以也休想外銷到咱們國內各地。</p>
<p>商界的新憧憬</p>
<p>有人說，要救濟目前中國的工商業，只有政府銀行大量低利放款。這個目標正是杭州各商界一致追求中的美麗憧憬，但是政府如果放款，獲得貸款後的明途又大堪疑問。例如高價收買蠶繭時，政府訂定一個相當的價格，繭商還爭着嚷不够高，而實際上收買時還不及政府訂定價格多多，這裏的原因就是因爲銀行有貸款，政府照訂定的價格貸給繭商，繭商以少數錢收繭，另外許多錢去作別種用途了。——這種用途想必又是高利貸放之類。因此我們爲了保障這批貸款確實用到工商界身上，而也確實是謀取工商復興的，只有嚴格的調查，嚴密的貸放，貸放以後，還要加以縝密的考核。有人說，如果把這些款項貸放出來，不是通貨更要膨漲，通貨更要貶値？我以爲這許多貸款只要直接貸到生產單位上，眞正使一個錢發卞一個錢的效用，則還可以復蘇一部份工商業。</p>
<p>堂皇的老口號</p>
<p>另外，我們想提出一個做了幾十年沒有成效的堂皇老口號，就是「中國人要用中國貨」，言先必須要養成國民愛用國貨的心理。記得在戰前上海虹口地方，有一個日本孩子，要買一匣自來火，他跑到一家中國店舖，店員告訴他：「中國貨自來火有的，比日本貨又便宜又好，你買舟匣去試試吧！」但這個孩子搖搖頭走了，他仍舊到日本店舖裏買一個日本自來火回去，這個故事可以警惕我們，可以喚醒我們，我們今天工商業如此脆弱，也只有這樣做，這樣做才有辦法。</p>
<p>獎勵特產出口</p>
<p>杭州是特產運銷的都市，浙江是晨業特產品的要地，如果這許多特產品一時運銷不到外國去，那麼大家都要垮台，所以政府應該大量投資，忍痛獎勵特產品出口，甚至，　點也　在所不辭。例如：現在茶　行莊因爲增加貨物稅而倒閉到二十八家之多，這就値得政府考慮的。</p>

<h3>兩百餘萬臺胞的再教育　公民訓練在台灣</h3>
<p>— 何敏先</p>
<p>十二日臺灣航訊</p>
<p>歷史上富有偉大意義的今年國慶日這一天，在台灣寳島上，乃是二百卅九萬四千六百八十五個男女靑年公民，先後陸續開始受「再敎育」的第一天，現已閉訓一個多月了。關於該省此次舉行這偌大規模，而具有普遍性的空前訓練工作，可算是史無先例，實屬創舉的一回事，其訓練動機，目標，及工作展開的內容與經過，據有關常局告記者，是這樣的：</p>
<p>認識本國實況</p>
<p>這次台省把這二百萬公民來個再敎育的動機，是爲着鑒於臺省過去受日本統治五十一年，在道悠久的桎梏歲月中，日本都是一貫的施行隔離政策，使本省同胞和祖國漸漸疏遠，現在本省光復已將一年，但我們誰都不能否認本省同咆對於祖國的一切，有深切認識的必要，這次舉辦最大目的，就是在於行使民權，而期健全我們的地方自治基礎，旋奉陳長官的指示，成人訓練應速舉辦，以簡單明瞭方式，告以本國史地及風土人情，，使認識本國實際情况，於是才組織這個「台灣省公民訓練委員會」，負責主持並推動一切，因本省同胞敎育水準，和守法習慣，都比內地任何一省爲高強，今後只要他們對於祖國的一切，有深切的認識，則對於國家民族，定有偉大無比的貢獻！</p>
<p>六個訓練目標</p>
<p>它的訓練目標有六：（一）加强認識中華民族，（二）深切了解我國的現狀，（三）積極闡揚三民主義的精義，（四）充分發揮忠孝仁愛信義和平諸美德，（五）全面普遍政令的宣導，（六）訓練普及的傳授。</p>
<p>三層基本組織</p>
<p>推動這種訓練工作的基本組織，分由省，縣（市）區，鄉（鎭）三層機關負責，如（一）省的方面：組織公民訓練委員會，由民政處，敎育處，宣傳委員會，及其他有關人員爲委員，來主持全省公民訓練事宜，並由民政　處長周一鶚爲主任委員；（二）縣市方面：也同樣設立委員會以縣市長爲主任委員；（三）區鄉（鎭）方面：派區長鄉鎭長爲督導員。</p>
<p>兩種訓練方式</p>
<p>至於訓練方式，按其性質，分有課堂式的訓練，即設立「公民訓練講堂」　普遢性廣泛的訓練，即「社會公民訓練」，（甲）公民訓練購堂—於每村里利用所在地學校教堂，中山掌及其他公共塲所爲堂址，（如因師資缺乏，得聯合二村里至三村里設置講堂一所，第一期每戶指定廿歲至卅歲之男女一人參加，如場所許可，師資不發生困難，得分設男女兩班，每期訓練期間，定爲用個月，每日兩　時，其時間以不妨碍他們之作業爲原則；（乙）社會公民訓練—利用各地電影院劇塲，爲實施社會公民訊練的　堂，每日於其開映前以卅分鐘時間放映幻燈並講演，或其他足以引起他們興趣方式，同時每日假廣播台作卅分鐘公民訓練課程廣播。</p>
<p>八項訓練課目</p>
<p>公民訓練講堂的課目，定爲政治的，與中國化兩大部門，前者如政令的宣傳，四權之運用，後者如史地的認識，黨養的灌輸，詳細內容有十二項：（一）國語，（二）國父遺敎，（三）總裁言論，（四）新生活運動，（五）歷史地理，（六）地方自治要義，（七）本省施政槪要，（八）時事講解，（九）法令講解，（十）體育，（十一）音樂，（十二）其他，觀上列幾項敎材內容，爲一個公民最低限度所必須認識的，假使個個都能好好地受訓，到了期滿，一定收穫很大，現此項課本，已由會編印十萬册負責分發，以應他們的需要。</p>
<p>師資就地取材</p>
<p>因爲限於經費，及徵集師資人才的不易，所以對於公民訓練講堂各科教師，均係就地取材，由各縣市該委員會聘請當地國民學校及中等學校敎師，行政及自治人員，黨國工作人員，政令宣傳人員，地方人士，以及其他訓練課目素有研究者，至於社會公民訓練廣播或講演人員，乃由省縣市公民訓練委員會，聘請富有學識及有敎學經騐者担任之，以上祖任人員，均係義務職，僅予以精神上的鼓勵，來協助公訊工作的開展。</p>
<p>考核獎懲嚴明</p>
<p>該會爲要明瞭此次各縣市推行情形，準備明年度開始第二期計劃的參考，及使此項訓練不致浪費時間，人力，與物力，而能獲得圓滿的效果，特派員分區出發全省十七縣市督　，預料經此次視導之後，必有許多珍貴意見的貢獻，並使我們更能明瞭此種訓練工作的實際眞相，至於獎懲分三方面：</p>
<p>（一）把公訓工作列爲負責主持各縣市縣市長及區公所市長，區署區長，鄉鎭長年終考成之一。</p>
<p>（二）受訓公民如有無故缺席違犯講堂規則，或其他不正當行動，按情節輕重予以警告或榜示缺席渚姓名，及處罰勞役（工役），一天至二天，（且受了前項處分後，仍得强制令其出席受訓。）倘情節重大者，得交當地警察機關依照違警罰則，從重處分，至於品性優良，遵守規則，測騐成績優良的受訓公民，亦予以傳令嘉獎。</p>
<p>（三）担任講堂之兼職敎師，如服務認眞教課努力，成績優良，予以傳令嘉獎，並記功，而列爲原服務機關年終考成之一。</p>
<p>進度循序而升</p>
<p>公民訓練課目已如上述，至其內容材料，完全以國民學校畢業程度之公民爲對象，行文舉例，力求簡明，同時各科教師，亦可隨時補充，至其進度乃循序而進，每週每一單元，試舉「國父遺敎」這一科，係列於第一周，而六天裏，是這樣的排列，第一日先講國父傳略，第二，三，四，五天，繼購三民主義中的民族，民權，民生，第五日則專講建國方略中的心理建設”第六日續講實業計劃與建國大　的政治建設，其他七周爲　栽言行，新生活運動，地方自治，而每一科也都是如上那樣平均的分配，有條不紊，使受訓者，對於每一問題都能得到整個的概念。</p>
<p>希望共同努力</p>
<p>台省此次舉辦公民訓練，其對全省同胞心理建設的關係非常重要。我們要建設三民主義的新臺灣，更必須注重他們的心理建設，不過這艱鉅的工作，是需要政府和人民雙方共同努力的。公民是國家的主人　，假使連做個公民所應有最低限度的智織與能力都缺乏，那便是大大減少了建設國家的力量，我在這裏很希望全臺灣梅一角落的　達人士，共同起來協助地方政府去完成政府這次實施公民訓練的偉大計劃，大家都抱着「以先知覺後知」「以先覺覺後覺」的精神，時時刻刻，予他們以實際上的帮助，以收輝煌的效果。</p>

<h3>新疆透視（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>張治中主席苟欲收復新省土人的信心，必須克復兩種重要的困難。第一，自南京取得經濟援助，以救濟新疆的頹敗的經濟局面，尤以修築公路　進交通爲當務之念。第二，消滅普遍的共產主義宣傳。無疑地，蘇聯對於新疆的政治前途異常　切。</p>
<p>張治中將軍爲恢復新疆的繁榮的安寗起見，特聘中國最前進與工程師十位，至迪化爲張氏策劃發展迪化計劃。</p>
<p>最後張氏急切需要一隊訓練有素，而體格强壯，能耐山嶺及沙澳中惡劣氣候的兵士，以代替現時駐守新疆各要衝地點的缺乏訓練的新兵。</p>
<p>醫藥槪況</p>
<p>新疆省因缺乏醫藥，醫師和醫院，公共衛生狀况極度惡劣。省府官員表示，苟非在隆冬蒞臨以前設法救濟，誠恐發疹傷寒與霍亂兩種時疫將使土著回民遭遇兀運。實際上這兩種亞洲的流行病目前比較緩和，在新疆死亡率　長增高的疾病倒是天花，赤痢，瘧疾，梅毒和傷寒。</p>
<p>據衛生當局估計，新省嬰孩死亡率超過百分之七十，大部分由於天花及赤痢所致。</p>
<p>嚴重的發疹傷寒流行病正在迪化四周的山嶺牧畜地蔓延開來，苟非自中國東部趕運血淸和DDT等預防劑來此，疫勢恐不久將蔓延至迪化。</p>
<p>擁有十萬人口的迪化僅有醫院兩所，一所是普通醫院，有床位四百隻，一所是精神病醫院，有床位四十隻，設備都異常簡陋。新疆全省共有醫院十所，床位一千一百隻。全省人口據山國政府估計爲四百萬，據回民自稱在七百萬以上，但這廣大的人口絕少醫藥的救助</p>
<p>據衛生當局透露：自一九四三年以來，從中國東部運至新疆省的藥品祗有三噸。據稱聯總在兩年前曾有藥品撥給新疆省，但因缺乏運輸工具，此項藥品現仍滯留於昆明，重慶及南京等地。</p>
<p>新疆亟吩聯總與行總趕運血淸，硫磺製劑及DDT預防劑等藥品，以搶救該處的危急的公共衛生情况。一架飛機便可載運充分的藥品，以挽救危局。這給予聯總及行總一個機會，以證明它的濟世工作的崇高的價値。</p>
<p>由於回民叛變成功所造成的政治局面，聯總或行總的藥品最好直接運交回民領袖，而無美國或中國官員伴送，否則回民將拒絕接受。</p>
<p>瑪那斯河是把中國和叛黨控制的新區西北分隔開來的軍事上的邊界，這裏象徵着中國所担負的政治和經濟建設的艱鉅任務。瑪那斯河上的「大西橋」在今年六月被洪水冲毀以前，原是接連沙漠與山嶺區的內地和肥沃的西北邊陲的新省唯一的公路橋樑，現在祗留着空洞的兩座三和土橋臺，對峙在瑪那斯河的兩岸。　據政府發言人告訴記者，當局此刻還沒有準備重建該橋，此橋苟付諸闕如，欲想恢復迪化國民政府與伊寗叛黨政府間的友好關係，殊屬難以想像。迪化和伊寗間的電報和電話綫，自從一九四四年九月十九日至一九四六年一月十九日回民叛變以來，一直斷絕到現在還沒有接通。</p>
<p>當今夏低潮時期，載　蘇聯布疋，糖菓和香烟等物的若干運貨車，還能够涉渡瑪那斯河而至迪化。可是冬天的大風暴已經來臨，預示這僅有的交通也將阻斷了。因此在明夏以前中國與伊寗間唯一的交通綫，須仰仗於蘇聯航空公司的運輸機的不定期飛行。中國力圖恢復其最大邊遠行省的土地完整，看光景連地理方面也在跟中國作對。</p>
<p>新疆省主席張治中將軍如欲收復新疆四百萬回民的信心，必須恢復新疆腹地的商業。事實上新疆可以外銷的物產，大多數生長在肥沃的西北三區，即伊犂·塔爾巴哈台及阿爾泰。</p>
<p>迪化在歷史上向爲新疆的行政要城，現正力圖維持其新疆南北駱駝隊商物物交換站的地位。現在除了化粧品，香烟，茶葉和少數布疋以外，幾乎沒有貨物從中國本土運來，因此迪化必須從伊寗叛黨那裏獲得各種供應品。但是除了茶葉，化粧品和香烟以外，迪化沒有伊寗所需要的物品。</p>
<p>迪化所急切需要伊寗出產的物品有五穀，牛肉，羊肉，獸皮，食米，水菓，汽油和黃金。但是即使瑪那斯河大橋重建以後可以運輸這一切商品，迪化終不能和哈薩克斯坦競爭，因爲後者有良好的公路，　富的消費物品和機器，爲西北區回民所需要而中國當局所不能供給的。新疆全省所急切需要的是紡織廠，把土產棉花和羊毛織成布疋。</p>
<p>盛世才於一九四二年排斥蘇聯工業時，曾以美金四百二十萬元向蘇聯購買一所現代式飛機製造廠，以便改變成紡織廠。盛氏復以美金五十萬元向上海某公司購買美國紗廠機器，但此項機器至今還沒有交貨。結果新省的數百萬土民和數千中國士兵寒表無着，準備再忍受一個酷寒的隆冬。附近蘇聯境內有着過剩的布疋，但爲了下列兩種原因無法得到：</p>
<p>第一，伊寗政府恐將反對</p>
<p>該項布疋運往迪化。</p>
<p>第二，自盛世才將新證西</p>
<p>邊的門戶關閉以來，蘇聯還</p>
<p>沒有和新省訂立過任何商約。</p>
<p>除非在一個月以內從　國本土經越二千哩的沙漠路程趕運布疋來此，則數百萬新省土民和數千中國軍隊將有凍餒之虞</p>
<p>國防公路</p>
<p>中國鑒於保衛其內亞細亞邊　疆的重要性，曾指撥法幣三百億元，以建築一個軍用公路網、，把廣大的新疆邊遠行省和中國內地接連起來。目前旣沒有修築被戰事蹂躪的內地各省公路的準備，此項不惜工本的計劃是値得重視的。這條新的國防公　　幹綫，從甘肅北部的蘭州穿越靑海的邊界，直達新疆省會迪化，長百一千七百理。自蘭州至都蘭一段約三百五十哩業已完成，從都蘭起須跨越崑崙山支脈，經過察丹盆地荒野的澤地，由此越過冰雪覆蓋的阿爾金山，穿入塔克拉麥根沙漠的南邊，在察克立克會合古代的隊商路徑，橫渡沙漠至庫拉，在此接速跨越天山的山路而直達迪化　此項艱鉅事業的必要性繫於下列的事實：目前新疆與中國內地唯一的速繫便是由蘭州經東邊星星峽山隘入新疆省境取道哈密的古代絲商公路。這一條中古時代的公路，在過去數月中常受土匪的襲擊，對於遊擊馬匪允多被襲的危險，這些馬匪常出入於外蒙古邊境的山嶺中。　這條蘭迪公路的主要目的在防止中國西部要塞迪化的被隔絕，它的戰略上的重要性不亞於蘇聯現將完成的新疆西邊界外的汽車公路。這條公路介於史達林那柏德與科洛格之間，通過帕米爾山中一萬三千呎以上的高原。但是不同的地方是：蘇聯採用現代的築路機，而中國則必須用人工築路，在嚴寒的冬天。　（完）</p>

<h3>翻印與翻譯</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>據外交部王部長自己于在立法院報告我們的，中美商約允許翻譯　國的出版物而禁止靜印。有人擔心甚至於連翻譯也在禁止之列，例如照一種人的解　說似使　國著作向中國當局註册或保留版權，那末這些刋物便應得到中國政府充分的保護。這一點我們希望外交當局把它說叫　　淸楚一點。</p>
<p>不過我們更覺得中美商的中連翻印的禁止也是多餘的。中國是一個科學落後的國家，中國人能讀英文書的人已經是少得可憐，甚至　於買得起中文書的人也就不可多得了。這種翻印的限制從美國的出版商看起來得不到多大的好處，因爲中國所能銷售的數量是很少。相反的，我倒覺得在中國書坊間散置一些翻版　四　還可以替原著作者發生一　　告和宣傳的作用。再從中國的西奮讀者　　起來這祗是禁止他們多讀西書。</p>
<p>老實說，假使翻印和翻譯不受巾美商約的拘束，雙方都可自由翻印和翻譯，道在中國是佔便宜的，因爲照中美出版界的現狀看起來中國所能得於美國著作方面多於美國所能得於中國著作方面的。但是我們要知道美商由於這次中美條約的簽訂所得的利益太多了。美國是一强國，即使在這一方面吃一丁點兒虧，在另方面亦很足以彌補的了，更何况這是與中西文化的交流有很大的關係呢！</p>
<p>這次的中美商的表面上看起來是平等的，而實質上是不平等的。我覺得中山先先所分別的眞平等和假平等也可以應用到這一方面來。美國　一個工商業都很發達的國家，而中國則不然。因此，假使說中美雙方可自由通航，這在表面是平等的，但實際上美國有船，而中國使無船可航。再如說，中美可以自由通商，但是美貨銷到中國來的多，而中國貨銷到美國去的很少。這不是不平等嗎？</p>
<p>旣然如此，何以在通航通商是開放的而在出版物的　印却又是禁止的呢？中國出版界方面祇覺得我們的外交當局沒有替中國的文化前途着想。</p>
<h3>讀「教師日記」</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>著者　豐子愷　出版處　萬光書店</p>
<p>豐子愷先生的一敎師日記」於三十三年六月在重慶出版，今年六月上海再版出書。內中有一小部分曾在二十八九年間後方各雜誌上發表過。七年前我得到友人從香港寄來的宇宙風，讀到一篇「敎師日記」，那是最初披露的。後來便一直沒有見過。</p>
<p>從那最初發表的一篇日記中，我窺見一個過着平靜生活的藝術家，怎樣倉卒地辭緣緣堂，率親族輾轉西行的艱苦狼狽的情形，心中深有所感。可惜以後便沒有能看到他更多的生活的記錄。現在豐氏把他的日記付刊了，我以兩個晚上的閒暇，在燈下披閱一過，正和最初看那簾日記時懷着同樣的心情，我的情緒彷彿隨着作者的情緒而起伏，我在咀嚼這位藝術家的生活。</p>
<p>在文學作品中，一般的說，傳記和日記最能感人，因爲這兩渚都是作者親歷的生活的實錄，它們能表現出一個人個性和人格的美，而兩者之中又以日記最易便人感動，傳記有時出於別人的手筆，而日記却都是自己寫的。我們如果承認小品文在表現上的自然靈活，那一定更覺得日記之可愛了。小品文的製作，不比宏論巨構，不像寫「大文章」那麼認眞嚴肅，有時只就偶然的感觸，片斷的觀察，一點不刻劃地形之　　，因此便覺情韻雋永，趣味無窮。大抵文字根與天性，由性靈傑處激發而出的和由實際體騐流露而出的一定來得逼眞而無虛飾，自然而無彫琢。照這樣說，日記更能合於自然表現的條件，晚明和淸代諸家的日記，至今還爲人傳誦，不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>就像子愷先生的這本日記，雖只薄薄一百六十餘頁，但從這中間我們可以看到他戰時生活的縮影，了解他平時的生活能度。他的心完全浸透在藝術之中，就在再怎樣艱苦和失望情形之下，也還是懷着一顆熱烈的滿注　希望的心。子愷先生藝術　　之深，這是我們都知道的。藝術家具有超越於常人的敏感，他對於世間的一切事相，能如實地領略，觀照，而還它本來面目，一點也不被外界的種種誘力和成見所蒙蔽，因此使能縮短人我之間的距離，做到「萬物靜觀皆自得」的悠然境界。人類之所以有仇恨，有猜忌，有嫉妬，實在由於人我之間的界限沒有打破，佛家所說的「我相」「我執」，確爲鄙嗇，慳貪之源。牘了「敎師日記」我們一定能體察到一個豁朗的藝術家的胸襟是何等的崇高，可貴。</p>
<p>這本「敎師日記」顧名思義，可知所記爲敎學生涯，內中所述包括作者西行後執敎桂　飾範的全部生活，離開桂師便繼續在浙江大學任敎，日記裏也可以看到一部分。作老在桂師和浙大兩校敎書，對教學方法，完全採啓發而不重注入。他所担任的是藝術科，他不注重模仿和臨摹，而重在激發學生的創造精神，提高學生的鑑賞能力，尤其　重的是要把藝術和現實生活溝通起來。作者認爲欲達到藝術敎育的目的必須使整個的生活　透進藝術的成分，以實現「藝術生活化」「生活藝　化」。的確，藝術是不可孤立的，隔離了現實生活的藝術，便不能稱爲藝術了。作者又要我們於理智與實利的批界以外另闢一限界，則「世間萬法常新，處處皆美的批界。」這境界豈是營營於利祿，役役於物欲者所能領略？</p>
<p>看了「教師日記」，我們可以知道豐先生不只是一位藝術家，同時也是一位理想的敎育家。在他的日記中，充滿了對靑年的熱愛。敎師除了必須注意敎材和敎法以外，更需要有一顆愛心。敎師不能眞誠地愛學生，不能以熱烈的愛去滋潤學生的心靈，那一定不會得到敎育的效果的。豐先生對學生的一言一行，往往於個別談話和偶然接觸之間，　露深沈的愛，他不愧爲「人師」，用他的人格感化他的學生，那種和對待自己子女一樣的關心和照護，可說完全發自內心，而毫無矯飾，尤其在細微處可以看出。我想　　者是受李叔同（即弘一法師）和夏丐尊兩先生的影響，因爲這兩位都是豐先生的師長，他曾受過他們兩位人格的薰陶。</p>
<p>日記中寫戰時的景象最多，有壯烈事蹟的記載，有敵人暴行的揭露，有振奮人心的言詞，有內心深處的感　。雖然有時免不了憤激，免不了慨歎，但却始終沒有失望，沒有頽喪。他深信中國的抗戰必勝，因爲他看到千千萬萬的靑年在抗戰巾成畏起來，千千萬萬的黃帝子孫在抵抗侵略的戰爭的洪流中，拚出他們的血與肉與敵人搏鬥。他對抗戰的樂觀精神正和他的誨人不倦的敎學精神同樣可敬。現在抗戰勝利了，也許覺得他的話無甚意義，其實他那時如此堅持必勝的信念實在是很不容易的。特別是在每一次受挫和受損害（如桂林大轟炸）以後，他一點也不表示頽唐和失望。談到戰時生活的艱苦，他總說「因禍得福」，實在這次抗戰是給山國新生的機會。</p>
<p>在這本日記中，字裏行間又洋溢着濃烈的人情味，一望而知作者藝術素　的深厚，就是一點生活上的小事，他都能給予它以一番藝術化的觀照，身邊瑣事都成爲人生寳貴的泉源，偶然小談都能襯托出無盡的深意。一種靄然的仁者之風，是儒家和道家思想的融化，是深得藝術之三味而表現出來的。</p>
<p>和作家往還的記述也不少，日記中提得最多的是傳彬然，丙　，宋雲彬，唐現之，夏丐尊，弘一法師諸人。他的夫人力民，及子女陳寳，　瞻，　　，一吟及新生子新枚更是日記中常提及的。家庭中一門雍穆和煦的氣氛，確實滋潤了作者逃難時的枯寂心悄。家常談笑，在常人覺無甚意味者，一到子愷先生的筆下便成爲娓娓動人的記述。如果不是一個獨具慧眼的藝術家，誰會在戰時的緊張生活中，體味到生命之美，嘗到家人父子的相處的樂趣呢？</p>
<p>村婦野的談話，牧童樵子的歌聲充分地表現出農業社會的自然與樸質；而作者的生活就浸透過這　成分。同時作者又是很懂得生活哲學的眞義的，他有一股生之活力，充滿在他的思想之中，所以他所說的話，即使是很平淡的，也能予人以雋永淸新之感。</p>
<p>凡是讀過子　生「　　堂隨筆」和「緣緣堂再筆」的人，一定能了解他的生活態度。我們總覺得他的散文有一種樸質澹遠的意境，他看宇宙萬物，無一不美，他覺得批間萬物，無一不値得人玩賞，體味。在他的日記中，我們也可以看到這種生活態度。還有，他的文筆輕鬆而活潑，沒有一點雕琢的痕跡，這與其說他文字的自然，不如說他性格的率眞。最近，他有一本散文集出版，題名「率眞集」，我想子愷先生的生活之所以令人嚮往，就由於他的率眞吧。</p>
<p>因爲他的生活自然而率眞，所以他的日記含有濃厚的幽默味，亦莊亦詼，頗能引人入勝。他的文字並沒有獨特奇妙之處，然而在平淡之中，却能顯出獨特奇妙。他已經做到寓至理於平實，寓世事於諷喻，淸淡處能尋出淳美的韻味，這或許就是子愷先生的日記所以能引起大多數人的愛好的原故吧？</p>
<p>子愷先生的漫畫，獨創一格，優點在綫條明快，表現逼眞，我想他的日記也具有這種特點。</p>
<h3>中國史學通論</h3>
<p>— 曰木</p>
<p>著作者：朱希祖　出版者：獨立出版社</p>
<p>中國史學各種體系發展之大概，爲每個愛好歷史學的朋友所必知；一般靑年對歷史的發展過程，自必須明白，而對於史學的發展，却亦當留意。因爲，歷史的記載，並不一定都是可靠的，歷占以來，多半是皇家年譜的「官史」，記載自有失實之處；而瞭解了史學的發展之後，則可以辯別出孰眞孰僞。在讀歷史方面，可以得到很多的帮助。</p>
<p>這本「中國史學通論」，是作者在北京大學史學系的講義稿，經其婿羅香林的編集，得使我們得到一本簡明扼要的中國史學概論。從而可以洞悉歷古以來的中國史學之發展過程。</p>
<p>首先，作者說中國史學之起源。「史」字的本義：說文解字有云：「史記事者也，從又持中，中正也。」作者做了簡略地說明並有　文術例。之後，它又聞明：有文字而後有記載之史，書記官之史，僞托追記之史。及未有文字由古物推測之史。這些舊時代並不稱爲歷史的諸史學系別，它均述出其利弊問題，那時候的「史」，祗是出自書記官之手的不很正確的「官史」，從而日漸發展，孕育了歷史的萌芽。</p>
<p>中國史學的派別方面：作者說了六種派別——這是自春秋以來，止於今日的各派，這六稱派別如次：</p>
<p>（一）　年史：以時爲區別者，亦稱時代史。這是始於西周之後的歷史，西周之前年代不明，故沒有此稱體制。我們常見的此種歷史，綜合的如「資治通鑑」，單獨的如「春秋」等。</p>
<p>（二）國別史，是以地方區別的，亦謂地方史。是將諾國古時的歷史，萃薈以觀；古代大小國家，不可簡略。綜合的如的三國志；單獨的如華陽國志等。</p>
<p>（三）傳記：拿人來的作區別；在這些裏面，「可窺知其地方文野之度，及社會得失之林。」常見的如女傳，東方朔別傳等。</p>
<p>（四）政治史與文化史：以率作區別，政治史方面包括經濟史，法律史，軍政史，社黨史，外交史。文化史方面則有學術，宗敎，文學，藝術，農業，工業，商業，風俗等項。前者如通典·通考，唐六典等。後者如別錄，七略，宋元學案，詩評等等。</p>
<p>（五）正史：所謂正史，非爲一時一人所作，而是歷代堆積起來的一部「官史」。如廿四史。</p>
<p>（六）紀事本末：一事的本末撰史的，至宋袁樞才創造此種體制。如通鑑記事本末，三藩記事本末，西夏紀事本末等。</p>
<p>以上六種，我不過舉其要目；本書中曾詳細地分節述明。</p>
<p>附錄二篇，其一說明「太史公解」，暢述司馬遷的撰史，最好請參考翦伯贊的「史料與史學」中，「司馬遷的歷史學」一文，可更知得詳鈿。另一篇是漢十二世著紀考，自漢高祖著紀，經過　帝，高帝，文帝，景帝，武帝，昭帝，宣帝，元帝，成帝，哀帝至平帝，這十二世的著紀，作者加以述別及列表更淸析地指示出來。</p>
<p>此書所述，雖很簡潔，內容却可稱廣泛，初學歷史的靑年朋友，可以拿它做一個良好的參考資料。雖遺漏之處，仍可找出，而在此時，尚可爲一般初學者之參證。本書中也舉出了史學上的許多錯誤。</p>
<p>在今日，誰都知道歷史在社會科學中，是一門佔重要地位的學科。已爲每個靑年不容忽視了，在讀史之前，我們更須明白中國史學的諸部門，裨使在讀史時，得到許多便利之處。</p>
<p>這本書可作讀史前的一個準備，亦可作已　史之後的一個參考。</p>

<p>— 許培基</p>
<p>在平易坦率的叙述後面，隱藏着淸雅雋逸的情趣的；這是田園小說所特有的一種風格。如果把自然界的景物來比擬宛如山泉滙流成的一條小溪，雖然是消涓的細流，但是　琮的水聲，還在曲折有緻的崖岸間，斷續地響着它未完的淸韻。在澄澈見底的河牀中，水面上緩緩起伏的波痕，分明可以看出生命的潛力，不斷地在那兒躍動。法國　治桑的「魔沼」，描寫法國農村一樁一　單質樸的故事，在看慣了雄壯懷烈的反映時代的作品以後，正　盛著的酷熱中服了一劑清涼的飲料；又象生　　　　的早秋，在略有寒意的凉風中，沐浴着晨曦的絲絲溫暖。</p>
<p>啊！故事的展開，眞像農人　使着他的耕牛，開出的一條溝一般地簡單，平直，而毫無一裝飾。這條溝，在廣闊的原野上，也許不久即爲第二條溝所掩沒，但是在作者的筆下，鮮活而熟練的叙述，却永遠地使它在人生的園地裏保持着一個深刻的印痕。</p>
<p>你看，一百年前一個鄉下老農的典型——理智的莫老爹——他　　着他的女婿，他掩飾起自已失去愛女的悲痛，毫不嫉妒地勸他年靑的女婿續絃。但年靑英俊的柔孟，性格忠實的書中的主人翁，他用他豐滿的熱情，眷念着逝去的愛妻，在他活潑的小兒女面前，他是一個體貼戀愛的爸爸。在伯雷爾農村，他的忠懇是得到全體住民的愛戴，雖然當地被小瑪麗的一舉一動所攝住的時候，他又愚昧得像一個無知的小孩一樣。但是道愚昧在某種塲合，却會促成他勇敢的剛決，當他踏進了他岳父莫老爹指點他去求婚的冉格寡婦的屋子，他立刻明察出誇誕虛浮與榮耀的不同的性質。他巧妙地退出了虛偽的圈套。小瑪麗的天眞聰明，作者不從　面描寫她的面貌，只以她的言談舉止來反映出她心靈深處的感應。她的坦白純潔和冉格寡婦虛驕的做作比較起來，其間的差別是何等遙遠，溫柔，伶俐，大自然的女兒；他感動了年將而立的柔孟，她贏得了莫老爹的　切，她又愛撫　柔孟的兒子——年未七歲的小筆爾。在她的眼中看來，她接受旁人的「愛」和她給予旁人的「愛」是沒有什麼等差的。但是在受到她「愛」的人們，却分明地感受到有着不同的份量啊！在故事的末尾，柔孟帶着近乎絕望的心情，走進紀葉特嬤嬤——小瑪麗母親——的屋子，向小瑪麗求得最後的「愛」的裁決的時候，她不覺驚喊着：「你沒有覺得我以前是愛你的嗎？」啊！讀者的心　也將被她這一聲率直的　喊所感動了。我們不難想像出，緊接着的是怎樣的一幕可羨的喜劇。</p>
<p>在故事的進程中，作者應用她嫻熟的技巧，把小筆爾嬌憨的語態，貫穿了全書的重要關節，是異常的適切有味。她又描繪了奧摩　　主的邪惡，當他凌逼着小瑪麗而柔孟給他處罰的辦法，不過把他拖下馬捺在地上；從作者仁慈的心腸，可以看出作者對於人生的看法，對於藝術的態</p>
<p>一藝術家對於他所居處的社曾的忠實的描繪，眞是痛苦的諷刺。他注神於罪惡同苦難；但是我們這些後一　的藝術家要描畫什麼呢？我們將等着　見死的期待就是今日人類的報酬，我們將祈求它來作爲邪惡的刑罰和災害的賠償麼？」</p>
<p>在喬治桑時代的歐洲，一般從琳藝術工作者，慣於揭露社會陰暗的一面，慣於把陰鬱的諷論，注人他們的作品。杜若（Albrecbt　Durct），米開朗基羅（Michaelangelo），賀拜英（Holbeih），卡羅（Callot），和歌耶（Goya），曾對他們國家的罪惡加以强烈的諷刺，他們不朽的作品乃是具有正　價値的歷史文件。我們不會拒予藝術家以探查並暴露社會傷痕的權利；但　露是藝術僅有的功用麼？</p>
<p>作者本着她眞率的心胸，吾認了這些庸俗殘忍的觀點。她以爲藝術的使命是一種情操與愛的使命，藝術家應該担負起一宗重大的富於詩意的工作——「我們寗取能够改宗的溫和柔婉的人物，而不取招致恐怖的驚心動魄的惡徒，因爲恐怖決不會矯正自私心，而只能增加它。」她肯定了他藝術的觀點之後，又發出了「生」的頌　——對於人生宇宙的看法。</p>
<p>「我們要注意生，而不是死。我們不再信賴　　的空虛……要生活豐富，我們須欣賞生活。拉撒路應離開他的糞堆那末　人就不必再以富人的死亡爲幸了。大家都應促進快樂，少數人的幸運才不致形成罪過和苦惱……我們可以不再視死爲繁榮的懲罰，或災難的藉慰……我們不再許聽任何墳墓做那些我們不願使之快樂的人們的唯一逃避所了。</p>
<p>把她這種正確的思想，去衡量今日社會上一般人所持的消極的態度，他們所遺棄着的快樂的秘鑰，是何等値得惋惜。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我們再求掩卷瞑想書中人物的聲　笑貌，活潑是動的氣息，含有一種樶欖般淸香雋永的風味，故事的結束，　像風兩過後的晚霞一般的明快。</p>

<h3>我最近的生活和寫作情形</h3>
<p>— 魯</p>
<p>弁言</p>
<p>還是本月十七日那天下午在文藝茶話會上，爲了大家一時的興緻，我擬了這個題目，請來參加的朋友們各人隨便寫一點身邊瑣事。用意無非在使讀者對作家多一層了解，也使本刊版而多添一些趣味。</p>
<p>承蒙那天參加的朋友們不以我這種「命題作文，當塲繳卷」的辦法爲侮，大家都推開茶盏，一揮而就。當時一共收到三十八件，還有接受了題目，的期交稿的在外。</p>
<p>現在依照收到的先後次序，先將已經整理好的月十份發表。只是爲了篇幅的限制，其餘和陸續收到的，準備在下星期內刊登。還希望朋友們原諒。　——編者</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>寫茶話會</p>
<p>茶依然是苦的，而且永遠帶有苦味的，正爲這點苦，我們不能忘懷。在苦味中談話，又覺得津津然。更何况談話的對象，都是些深知苦味的同道，便不惜話之多，不辨茶之苦了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我最近的生活不外敎書，編輯，寫稿，這些事。每逢星期一，三，五在江灣國立復旦大學中國文學系敎「曲選」「中國小說史」和「中文系國文」。星期二下午則在市立實騐戲劇學校敎「中國戲劇史」。</p>
<p>我在北新書局任總編輯，編有「靑年界」月刊，這刊物已經有十幾年的歷史，是以大中學生爲對象的綜合刊物，戰前銷數曾達數萬份。現出至新二卷第三號。另外我在大晚報每逢星期二出「通俗文學」週刊，中央日報每逢星期四出「俗文學」週刊。在本報春秋寫稿的戴望舒，葉德均諸先生都這兩個刊物的基本撰稿人。研究中國小說戲曲幾乎成爲我的癖好。</p>
<p>因爲生活冗忙，沒有整段的時間，所以不能寫有系統的整部著作，只是替各刊物寫寫零星稿子，但每苦於應付，幾有無話可說之感。所寫的以小說戲曲考證爲多，偶爾也寫一點讀覺與觀劇的感想。各刊物都希望我寫文壞憶舊，但我已出過「文人剪影」與「文人印象」，新認識的文人雖多，均無深交；最大的遺憾是無暇細讀每一個作家的作品，因此勉強寫出來都不深刻，我以爲寫這一類的文章是最古的事。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>惟恐吃不飽飯寫不出文章。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>進珊的拉稿木領太大，我剛坐下，還沒有和他談話，便出了題目要繳卷，這是考新生的方式，眞有點吃不消，好在不拘字數，也不限文體，那麼我就「應試」一次吧。</p>
<p>我這次是從漢口來，路過上海到北平去。自從六號到今天我都是過的旅途生活，所以非常不安定。但能够會到十多年甚至二十年來沒有會過的朋友，這是一件很快樂的事！</p>
<p>至於談到寫作，非常慚愧，打算寫的「勝利旅行記」，剛開始，等到了北平把生活安定後，我準備寫完「偉火的女性」和「在烽火中」兩個長篇，此外就想多牘點書。</p>
<p>離開上海九年多了，許多老朋友今天能够會面，實在使我太高興，要談話了，文章就此打住。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>最近，我回了一次十年未回的故鄉。返申後，原想寫些感想之類的小品，送給進珊，恰値午報發刊，編者要我續寫「娃娃日記」。於是轉變計劃，才寫數段，娃娃撒嬌，不肯寫了。正巧冰瑩從漢口來，她要到北平去編「文藝與生活」月刊，向我要「文藝作品」，想就把這未完成的娃娃日記給她，可是娃娃年齡太稚，怕經不住舟車之勞。况且時令已入冬季，北平正冷得要命，更怕我的娃娃吃不消也；祗好另想別法。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>提起我的生活，實在不足道。記得在二十年，當我在學校裘的時候，讀到科學的人生觀論戰，中有吳稚暉先生的人生觀是「吃飯，生兒子，招待朋友」三項，這二十多年來的生活，也不外乎這三項；最近的生活，除了第二項不預備再擴張外，第三項是始終是一的，我每决參加文藝茶話，也無非是想多招呼朋友而已。</p>
<p>講到寫作，非常慚愧，天天爲吃飯忙，一面當律師，一面做生意，實在不常動筆，如果編者要我寫文章，當然不敢推却。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>我最近除了每天要辦固定的例行公事之外，在公餘的時候，還擔任了兩三個刋物的特的撰述，那就是一天都忙不過來了。跳舞塲沒有我份，最多也不過看看電影。酒不喝，菸不抽，這是三十多年都如此的。除了寫作之外，讀書，看報，也是每天必有的事。</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>我現在天天忙　在商船，誠明，美專三個學校上跺，趕鐘點，擠電車，可以說是「日無暇晷」；因此寫作的工夫也就微乎其微。暑假前還天天作畫，現在每星期只能畫一兩幅，短文也可以勉强寫一兩篇；至於計劃中所擬增訂的「中國畫家人名大辭典」，所編的「中國歷代書畫大　」都無法進行，只好等到生活稍爲淸閒的時候再行究工了。</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>生活呆板，可是有詩爲證：</p>
<p>「有見必錄聞必寫，四時無假幾時休？久聚反敎疏友誼，臨歧却又賦離愁！」（其一）</p>
<p>「春花秋月等閒過，蝸角鵬搏盡網　，却恨筆錄秃已久，删詩書史奈之何！」（其二）</p>
<p>「翩若驚鴻宛若龍，浮雲世事九州同，請君入甕君莫笑，我也糢糊在畫中。」（其三）</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>在抗戰前度粉筆生涯，被陷江南，參加游擊工作，飽受風霜。勝利後第一回做公務員，或許是倖途，職務很淸閒，於是讀寫工作公然在辦公桌進行。蕭乾兄返國後主持大公文藝編務，囑爲「文藝」經常寫書評。旅居靡定，生活動盪，關於參考書籍不便多羅致，亦不易搜購，自知在寫作上不能多所例證；寫一篇書評不能把作者整個創作的過程詳加論列，這使我內心時感不安而靦　間世也。</p>
<p>十一</p>
<p>我是一個現任的小學敎師，談到小學敎育，該是何等的重要，從事敎育工作的人該將全副精神和全部的時間貢獻給我們的後一代。但現在是一個不如意事十常八九的時代，文化人自然不能忘情於文藝藝術。</p>
<p>我現在正在寫短篇小說，但這個時代往往不能隨心所欲的完成一個作品，其原因當然很多，其中最重要的要算是寫作的環境了，在整個生活不能安定的氛圍下，文藝作品的產生是爲難的。</p>
<p>十二</p>
<p>講到生活，似乎最近和過去一樣，沒有什麼變化。前一星期，回過家裏，過了一些比較閒逸的生活，欣賞了一些深秋的處山，嚐了一些八年沒有嚐過的王四酒家的「油鷄」風味。</p>
<p>最近，我的「明代四大畫家」，世界已把它排校完竣，「色彩學研究」，商務已和我訂了版稅契的。於是，又引起我寫長稿的興味，預備在年底以前，完成一本三萬字的「中國新興美術簡史」，很想以「唯物」的看法來寫，這是一個　試，不購得會不會寫　。</p>
<p>十三</p>
<p>今年上學期在東矣大學和省立蘇州工業專科學校等上課，再加上地方上的種種事情，忙得我沒有閒暇讀書。最近來上海，雖然依舊是忙，但比較地好得多了。每隔一二星期回蘇州，有時赴杭州，生活方面，加添了不少與趣。忙裏偸閒，很想讀些古典文學方面的名著。暫時不想寫作，要預備的，是想寫「中國通史」，但這不是一件隨便的事，現在還不敢說，一定好動筆咧。</p>
<p>十四</p>
<p>我最近在銀行的公餘之暇，因爲主編浦東的地方報「東報」的緣故，所以影響到窟作的時閒。但願有些時間，先將「廣西特種部族」的文稿整理後，即行寫定「盤古研究」和「洪水傳說與伏羲造人神話的探討」二書。至於「西南採風記」及「戲劇評論集」二書的規樸已經粗具，如有出版的機會，就可以即行整理而付印的。</p>
<p>十五</p>
<p>進珊先生出了題目，並且，命令一句話，『當塲交卷』！腦汁雖然枯涸，橫絞直絞的，一點，一滴，也絞不出來。可是當塲交卷的吩咐，啊！敢不遵命！</p>
<p>生活，在以前，也許是因爲光棍的獨身漢罷，往往是，有了酒，醉啊；有了錢，用呀；有了時間，玩啊；鬧，一個不亦樂乎！深夜裏漫步，暴雨中遊園，那是家常便飯。也許是戰爭的關係吧，人的性情要亂世中平靜，似乎不可能的。</p>
<p>最近，我轉變了。引用一句文人的口頭禪我改變作風了。很抱歉，倒也不是爲了有太太的緣故。（內人是河東「鼠」，郤不會作獅吼，眞是蠢驢！）然而，自問生活，是應該整飭了。要堅忍，要刻苦，那是需要決心的。</p>
<p>所以，最近我在決心，嘗試着生活的鍜鍊！</p>
<p>近來，雖然，也很想寫作，但是缺少了孩子般的傻氣，苦幹的精神，更缺少了，對自己的信任，除了偶然的翻譯之外，實在不敢執筆。實在不敢執筆。</p>
<p>十六</p>
<p>我是新聞從業員，抗戰期中，都在後方報界服務，因我在北方住久了，不　西南的生活，而且在後方的　友漸漸的快走光了，大有　羣索居之感！所以我也就於十月廿一日離開錦城，來到京滬，看看久別的朋友，二三日內就要到久別的故都，從事於新聞事業。</p>
<p>十七</p>
<p>八年來　遲於妖氛籠罩的上海，串而不作漢奸，終年惟有閉戶作畫；有時寫幾句小詩，一吐胸臆。許多友人以爲窮苦如我，一定已經餓死了；關懷我的好友，每問及我的最近生活，我只請他看看我畫室一付自撰聯，聯云：「半日讀書，半日作畫。有時　菜，有時栽花。」這是我的生活寫實，但自顧一事無成，兩　垂垂老矣，似此又覺很對不住關懷我的好友。</p>
<p>十八</p>
<p>誰都知道跑　聞是一樁最自由的工作。無枸無束任意發展，當然很有人羨慕。不過踏入了這圈內，也有很費腦筋的地方，每天追尋綫索，急理時間，不分畫夜，不論遠近，到處去鑽，到處去訪問。我每天就是在這種的情形下生活。不過我很高興，我很覺得有趣味，心情是愉快的。</p>
<p>因爲凡　偏重於新聞的消息稿，對於文藝的寫作無形中却冷淡下來。但　並不是放棄，並不是厭惡，實在的，却遺是時間的不够，所以了新聞稿之外，再寫些新聞性的特寫外，最近可以說沒有寫別的東西。</p>
<p>十九</p>
<p>我因爲參加抗戰工作，投效空軍。多年的機械式的生活，使我感到無聊，所以爲了調濟精神，而從事寫作和研究文字，最近三年寫成勝利字體一書，換了八次稿子，製成新字體的方案，保留舊漢文的特色，採納各國文字的特長。解決了拼音字的同聲字問題，和方言的問題。現在開始出版問世，以供文化界的研討指敎。</p>
<p>二十</p>
<p>進珊先生：</p>
<p>承你關懷詢問我的「生活」和「寫作」情形。實在抱歉，近日我生活是過得非常的簡單，除每天讀報看雜誌外，簡直是什麼事都沒幹，一方面是爲了店務的繁忙，沒有寗靜的心思寫稿，不！坦白的說，我還够不到資格，然而，我是一個愛好文藝者，雖然我的力量不足，但我要去學習，獻出我的一顆赤誠的心去學習，以後還希多多的指導。最好「文藝茶話會」裏，能組設一「文藝寫作指導組」那就好了。</p>
<h3>給文藝茶話會</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>其文蔚豈無君子於藝游更有碩人；煮雪我來一長揖，婆娑相話亦相親。</p>
<p>是上星期吧！陳承蔭約我到「文藝茶話會」去，本來，我也想順便看看孫福熙，華林。恰巧又碰到了趙景深，這總算不孤寂了。雖然文藝茶話會的盛舉我是第一次參與；據說它的成立遠在十四年前，但十四年以前，記得我常到孫福熙家裏去，那時我還年靑，接觸着這位眞具有「文」「藝」的，又是淸逸的隱居士，太使我感動了。他那大領結，長頭髮，靄然的言談，許多年來深深烙印在滄桑磨倦了的旅人心底不會消泯過。那時他辦有「藝風」雜誌，因爲一個旅人生活的播遷，在上海的時期很短，除了偶然寫一二小品發表本報當時的本埠增刋之外，別的刋物都沒有動過筆，，不久，我到了南京，生活比較安定了，可是鎭天的等因奉此，又纏得頭腦發昏。我住的是「羊皮巷」，每决望着河隄，疏柳，懷念百里奚的五羚羊皮，在這個時代，又怎樣漲得起窮文人的身價？於是一閒下就驅筆　愁了，華林編的中央日報「中央公園」可以說是我的遣愁公園。「白華」爲我紀念亡去的母親那時起的筆名，老作家宗白華却不以爲忤，他寫的是中央日報副刋版，似乎成了並行面不悖。記得有一次，華林把我的文章分開了原名筆名於同一天登出兩　來，漸漸，原名反而湮滅，許多朋友都以筆名喊我了。「藝風」的一個短篇「月」，也是那時在南京寄去的。寫作的興趣得說是濃厚了，所以我沒有參與文藝茶話會却和它的發起人結了翰墨緣。</p>
<p>十四年以後的現在，文藝茶話會還沒有在大新五層樓恢復的一段時期，我却和文藝茶話會的友人又結了綠；那是　渦去歲尾年頭的時期，我拉魏金枝合編的「文壇」月刋，因銷數的不能維持天折了，同時，郭蘭馨要我代編的某報副刋，爲了稿費關係離開，我只兼了之江法政兩處課，覺　無聊，這時，陸丹林正編「人之初」，邀我去幫他也許是聲應氣求，我們很合得來。還有陳承蔭那是許多年來我常會而的朋友一直到現在，從徐仲年一文裏才知道他倆都是文藝茶話會的中堅。文藝，我是門外漢，何况中年哀樂的我，已提不起那「倚馬」的勇氣，不過，渺漠的前情後况，使我對文藝茶話會無形產生了一點溫情，一些親切，感和孫福熙重把手之下，他說：</p>
<p>「你還是一個老樣子」、！</p>
<p>這使我苦笑，十多年了，還能够老樣子嗎？那天到的人很多，承蔭不憚煩的替我介紹，我想到了「君子豹變，其文蔚也」。。文藝的「文」該形而上以達于德業的蔚盛的。「游于藝」，更是前聖的詔示，可是，我詩中說的「碩人」，並不一定指一碩人其頎」的碩人，碩字的本義是大的意思。文藝爲什麼從茶而不從酒？這我很贊同酒要亂性，茶則可以淸心，關外在飛雪了，如果我們拿雪水煮茶，那更好見「事文類聚」：</p>
<p>「　　得黨太尉，取雪水烹茶，曰黨家有此樂否？曰，彼安識此，但能於銷金帳下，飲羊羔美酒耳」。</p>
<p>這樣，文藝茶話會的友人在「婆娑載籍之塲」而相形的總不至流於俗套吧！這在前幾天「春秋」上陳承蔭華林徐仲年所談改進的幾點已說明了。一點溫情，一些親切感我就寫上這麼一首不成樣的詩。</p>
<h3>文壇趣屑</h3>
<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>陳石遺寓蘇時、年八十矣。平日以詩壇祭酒自居，倚老賣老。南昌邵潭秋，偶過吳門，介金松岑謁之。石遺以爲後生小子，白眼相加。潭秋大怒，就石遺詩之用典錯誤處，舉十餘條質之，石遺瞠目不能答。越日上已，南京烏龍潭有修　之集，主其事者爲曹　蘅，邵元冲諸人，而奉石遺爲盟主。潭秋乃作「詩厄篇」一文，痛底詩人互相標榜之無恥，駡得石遺體無完膚，論者皆稱潭秋快人快事，石遺遭茲巨創，始對潭秋刮目相看，不敢再賣老矣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　99</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>所以這種「五級測騐」，竟不容易混過，最佳的成績，也得四十八個小時。那就是說，從第一到第五級測騐，你都答覆滿意，無一點不會「邏輯」之處，同時也能熬受每種測騐下的刑騐。不過其中也有經過關說，在測騐時，比較通融得多的，也是常事。像鶴見玉這次回國受測騐，事前就有大力的脚色，早已替他關說過了；囚爲鶴見是「少壯派」中，超等幹才，會裏應當羅致，所以只經過了四十八小時的各項手續，就在這天午夜完成了一切「入會式」。</p>
<p>鶴見這時經過五級測騐，成功了黑龍會員，對於探素「七封秘緘」，獲得不少便利，雖說相當興奮，體力上却十分萎頓，而且念念不忘那「七封秘緘」到手以後的揭露工作，所以想到上野公園去疏散一下，一而可以恢復一些精神，一而也可以澄淸一切思慮，以備進到下一步工作。</p>
<p>誰知剛剛走了幾步，驀然覺得有人從屋角簷下，出來尾隨。這種事情，在普通人知覺上，當然毫無感應。鶴見心中有事，更受過相當精嚴訓練，自己本身就是一個幹着這件勾當的人，當然容易察覺。並且這時已經夜午，道上行人稀少，列容易辨別這人究竟是在尾隨，或是不相干的普通行人。</p>
<p>可是鶴見一發現有人尾隨，並不大驚小怪，只在心下默記「一個」。那就是說，被他發現了一個吊綫的人。殊不知剛剛記下了一個，接着就有五個之多，從街道的左右暗陬裏，踅了出來，遙遙吊在相當距離地方，亦步亦趨。要是僅僅是黑龍會爲了完成手續，派出人來，製造一種「投名狀」，那在鶴見方面，可說一種兒戲玩意，　可毫不措　。但鶴見一身，藏　變重，甚至於三重秘密的人，豈能大意？</p>
<p>「是蘭組的鷹犬？是黑龍會的死敵，江川復興會？（這復興會中多半是從前幕府派的黨徒，在內政上與黑龍會勢不兩立。）還是其他新興的暗巾危險敵人？」因爲這時對華侵略作戰，已經醖釀成功；軍·政·財·三界，貪功貪財的傢伙們，早已樹立許多黨派，對外爭利，對內爭權，甚或權利同爭；各黨彼此傾軋，手下擁有死士，專門幹着暗殺工作。</p>
<p>若在平時，別說僅僅五六個人，鶴見不把他們放在限下，就再加上一倍，也得掂掂他們的斤兩，先開開玩笑再講。要曉得鶴見的「柔道」，快到七段，通常十來個人，很易打發，「劍道」也過了五段，並且從過當代的馳名劍師，經過特別手法，能够赤手對劍；至於槍法，除了在陸大受過射擊專技褒獎狀外，在軍人郊外「烏目」團襄，得過首獎。但他爲什麼到東京來？爲什麼投身黑龍會？豈不都是爲了要揭發　國際上幾個魔首七封秘緘的秘密嗎？</p>

<h3>血漿</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>血漿的買賣案件，成爲時髦的課題之一了，其實，和其它汽車，鋼鐵，飛機器材，軍用毛　，配給食盒等同樣都是一種商品，又有什麼兩樣呢？不過因爲它是血漿，鮮淋淋的人體裏面的東西，所以大家對它特別注意起來。</p>
<p>美國對外物資淸理會，是應該負這次事件的實任的。第一，商人是用正式手續從淸理處購買得來的，旣非偸盜，又非走私；第二，血漿是混雜在許多物品中，事前，誰也不知道，而且淸理會從未宣佈過禁止買賣；第三，所謂黑市一名詞，引用在這里是不大貼切的，行家大批買進來，加上利息，運費，消耗等，批發給各藥房，自然得提高售價，藥房公開標價出售，這是黑市嗎？售價提高，這是黑市嗎？</p>
<p>旣然自己親手賣出，怎能又說買進的人是違法，倘使違法，第一違法是賣出的人。所以千不該萬不該，還是在當初標售時缺少愼重考慮。</p>
<p>現在這批血漿被查封了，經營溢筆買賣的人，眞是啼笑皆非，他們現在表示祇要有合理的代價，儘可收　，雖然損失，也無可奈何，希望主持人能考慮這一辦法，否則，將來商人將不敢與淸理會交易了。</p>
<h3>迅速·乾脆·痛快的原始司法公演　一位外記者的報道</h3>
<p>— 瞭然</p>
<p>美國　聞記者艾若思（WilliamAyers）曾經在山東的共產黨「解放區」住過一些時日，回滬以後最近曾在本市英文大美晚發發表幾篇回憶「解放區」的文章，其中最使人感覺興　的一篇，是敘述共產黨人如何處法漢好的那篇。因爲從這篇文童裏，我們可以看出共產黨的司法機關如何組織，如何行使職權，和共產黨的司法觀念到底如何。該文起首敘述中國農村的和平　靜，突然間，該文寫道：「胡秘書說：「今天下午有群眾集會…我們要把一個人處死」事情這　　　而突然的，當地第一號漢奸要受審判了。事前沒有佈告週知，也沒有新聞紙登載消息：在共黨政權　堅　地組織　的各小組的領袖，都收到了如下的命令：今天下午在你們的小組裏選派若干人去開會。』預審是沒有的，和國際法庭審判日　兩國戰爭罪犯顯著地相反。</p>
<p>的時候胡秘書告訴我（　記者自稱）說，那漢奸可以不必受　，只要他　　悔和承認他的罪惡。在其後的二十四小時中，和我談話的共產黨員，都異口同聲地認爲只要那漢奸肯悔過，他可以不必受審。我每次聽到這句話，總要戰　，因爲這句話有宗教色彩，和共產黨的唯物　　相反。……共產黨第八路軍對付俘虜的辦法，是施以感化教育，光詆毁對方進行戰爭的不對、其次　揚共產黨，最後是　　　　：對於他個人，和平較戰爭更有價值；被感化的俘虜如果表示懺悔和決心改過，便可獲釋，否則須受審判。這一次受審判的漢奸在某，受了八路軍一年的感化敎育而不悛悔，所以要在八月卅一日那天受『審判』。在這裏『審判』一詞和國際法庭審判日德戰爭罪犯所用『審判』一詞名相似而實不同。漢奸汪某所受審判其實可算是在那一年感化敎育中己不公開地舉行過了，那一天我眼見的審判，不過是判決主文的宣示母須猜測如何判決，大家早已知這判決結果了。</p>
<p>劇情</p>
<p>大約有兩千人坐在」—上。露台上揭開布幕，合中坐　法官孫某，其右是兩個「政府」方面的法官，三個人民團體所派的法官。其左是檢察官俞某和書記官。犯人卡車駛來的時候，汰庭上一陣沉寂……我想起了　國大革命的鼓聲。卡車在台前　下，兩個警術押着犯人，犯人的雙手反銬着。…檢察官開始論告。…檢察官論告完畢…孫法官發問這：「論告公平嗎？」被告回答；「有些地方錯了，有些事情不是我幹的。」問：你要傳證人嗎？」答：「不敢麻煩法院」。於是孫法官走向集會的羣衆，詢問人民有何意見。沒有一個人開口。「依照被告所犯的罪，應該判處死刑，法　　已經商量過了，你們的意見怎樣」孫法官向空中揮舞拳頭，大醒呼喊：「殺！」於是群眾也大喊三聲：「殺！殺！殺！」孫法官由口袋裏把寫好的判決書拿出，一行一行的念下去……」念完之後，當塲將被告槍斃。（全文見十一月十四上英文大美晚報）</p>
<p>從上面的事實觀察，共產黨的司法　念是原始的，落伍的，野蠻的；和近代民主的司法觀念相去十萬八千里：依照民主政治的原則，司法權和行政權是分立的，而共產黨的司法，則純粹是行政的附屬。共產司無所謂「罪刑法定主義」，有罪並非必　，只要肯「懺悔」，即可宣告無罪；不肯懺悔，即須判處死刑。因此，全部共產司法，只要八個字就可包括；「順我者生，逆我者亡。」共產司法不過是達到政治目的之手段，其本身並無獨立性；因此，只要政治目的達到，司法手段即可不必使用，被告目然無罪開釋了。審判官有人民代表，似乎是陪審制度，然而共產黨治下的人民代表徒有其名，連開會的「羣衆」也是由上面下命令「各小組領袖」選派若干人參加的，則陪席的人民代表更是共產黨自己挑選的，可想而知。即使眞由人民選出，其任務恐怕也僅止於陪席而已，如果首席法官不喊「殺」，他們大槪也不敢先喊「殺」的，不見那些「羣衆」麼，法官詢問他們意見如何，沒有人開口，直到法官揮拳大呼「殺」！他們才跟着「殺！殺！殺！」，可見得這些陪審員是拿來　騙老百姓的，他們的意見根本不能影響判決。還有一層，司法機關代表國家行使刑　　，對於應負刑事責任者，有依法處斷之　　，不必徵求一般人的意見；而共產司法則不然，一方面判決結果早爲衆所週知，法官早已寫好判決書放在衣袋裏，一方面却假惺惺詢問羣衆應如何判決，其偽善雖可笑，而此舉動實和近代司法觀念絕不相容！</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>共產司法沒有级審制度，無所謂上訴，覆判，抗告，再審，一經判決，立即執行，判決即有不當，毫無救濟的辦法。也沒有預審，審判程序非常簡　僅有攻擊，並無防禦，被告出庭不僅身體受拘束（帶手銬），且並無　　法律的人代其辯護；因此短短數十分鐘，即可終結一案件，較之　蘭　審理德國戰爭罪犯需時一年，東京審理日本戰爭罪犯已歷半年，上海高等法院審理漢奸每案需時數月，與共黨司法相差懸殊。近代民主國家都承認刑罰以預防犯罪爲目的，刑事訴訟採實體的眞實發現主義，因此被告在未經判決以前假定其爲無罪，對於被告有利或不利的證據均應調查應該給予被告辯護的機會，和最後陳述的機會。共產黨認司法是上層建築，刑罰無非以消滅共產主義的障礙爲目的，所以一切所謂審級，辯護，偵查，預審，當然沒有了。這種司法，和近代民主國家的司法觀念相去甚遠，所以說是原始的，落伍的，和野蠻的司法觀念。</p>
<h3>從照片想起</h3>
<p>— 醉飲</p>
<p>無論怎樣兇惡的人，拍起照片的時候，總喜歡帶着三分笑容；即使不笑，也要裝出一種樣子，使人對他有好的印象。人之所以異於禽歡者，大槪就因爲多了這麼一點。</p>
<p>所以，當你在照相館櫉窗前看一看那些不同的面孔時，總覺得那些人都似「善類」，都「笑容可掬」，都威武有爲；沒有一隻面孔，讓他的猙獰本相，現於鏡頭。據說，這固然是虛僞之允，但社會秩序却全賴此以維持。</p>
<p>這些話，是不久以前有人和我談起的。當時只覺得說這話者，頗有見地。不料到了今天，我愈覺得上面這種深入淺出的說法，眞有道理！</p>
<p>你看：從德國的戈林到中國的周佛海，這些戰爭的劊子手及侵略者的帮兇，一到法庭，無不滔滔雄辯，說得天花亂墜，如果我們天眞一點，眞要覺得這個世界上都是仁義道德的大好人。戈林在自殺以前，還設法傳出了遺囑，大說「德國人民今後使命」云云，他並非至死不悟，他何嘗不知道過去是胡作胡爲，但他儘管肚里明白，嘴里却不能不「神聖」地胡道一番，企圖使人把他看作革命者；再者，像周佛海這樣的惡貫滿盈的大奸，也都不能不來一套瞎說八道的辯護。好在上海以及許多陷區的男女同胞都還健在，且都還不太健忘，不然的話，周佛海那些「簡直激動人們心弦」的侃侃之談，眞要叫我們墮入五里霧中了！</p>
<p>使我最感到興趣的是：自從第一號漢奸陳逆公博公審以來，大大小小，無一不是堂皇自白，振振有詞，他們之中，有的雖明知難逃一死，但仍不肯放坦白點，都不的而同地大放厥詞，做出「道貌岸然」的樣子。這正如：拍照時，即使是一個殺人盈野的大盜，也露出幾分和　可親的樣子。</p>
<p>這年頭，再沒有人把心暴露出來了。大家都在胡說八道的做戲！怪不得，幾年前，馬尼刺一個嬰孩，因爲心臟長在胸外，三天以後就死去了！</p>
<h3>私生活</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>從夏佩珍說起</p>
<p>十五年前，僅次於胡蝶的女影星夏佩珍，勝利後因吸毒案，被判徒刑一年。據報載，她即可釋放。這消息使我想起了這位曾演「火燒紅蓮寺」紅星的往事。</p>
<p>民國廿一年，她加入明星公司，開始那黃金時代的影星生活。當時，她的收入除去酬勞外，月薪兩百元，拍一天的戲代價是七十元，這種優厚的待遇，非一般人所能比，然而，她却因此而染上世上最惡的嗜好。她的藝術成就，至此即被摧毁殆盡。後來，她離開明星公司時，曾與公司打過筆墨官司，一時，她是婦孺皆知的新聞人物，然而，洪水猛　般的毒物，漸潮銷磨了她的靑春和生命力，而至一蹶不振，在影壇上總很少表現。這一段藝人的墮落史，在我們追記起來，也覺得無限惋惜！現實，始終是最冷酷的！從夏佩珍想起了袁美雲，這一對黑籍紅星都犯着同樣毛病。前途就斷送在「一失足」之間，現在是沒有辦法了！</p>
<p>影劇藝人，生活淸苦，令我們同情，但也正因爲日夜工作，生活方式較自由，最易使私生活走上崩潰的道路。一念之差，即致無可救藥；我不是在這裏說教傳道，但作爲一個藝人，必須能够自己管理自己，自己的束自己，不然的話，情感一旦奔放無束，則墮落，腐化，以及白殺殉情，那些Sentimental　的行爲，都足殺死個人，又殺死藝術！</p>

<h3>無辜的殺人犯　9</h3>
<p>— 許桂</p>
<p>不一會兒，他聽見下面的人大呌起來，他知道他一定差不多到　頂點了，他睜開眼睛，看見魯遜靠着牆上站着，離開他大約有十尺的距離。米恩覺得有一點量眩，但一點都不害怕，反而覺得快活起來。他：「魯遜！」</p>
<p>「我是米恩呀。」</p>
<p>「唔。」</p>
<p>「我來這裏陪伴你下來，你用不整担心，我會照顧你的。」</p>
<p>魯遜略爲動了一動，但並未轉過身來。他說：「我祗能够　　做。我知道人家一定會誤會我的。但是，管不得許多了。」</p>
<p>「我爬上來爬得好苦啊。」米恩快活地說，「你到底怎樣跑到這裏來的呀？」</p>
<p>魯遜說：「我猛擊他的頭顱，然後把她槍殺了。他的頭顱結果沒有破裂。那條棍子居然彈得飛出去了，震得我的手好痛啊。」</p>
<p>「不要緊」，米恩說，「現在樣樣事情都過去了。」</p>
<p>魯遜突然間舉起頭來，用着特殊的音調呌了一聲：「米恩！」</p>
<p>「噢，魯遜！」</p>
<p>魯遜停了許久，然後問：「你以爲這樣做會傷她的心嗎？」</p>
<p>米恩答：「天啊！她一定不會傷心的。她絕不會覺得什麼的。」</p>
<p>「你以爲一定是這樣的嗎？」魯遜怪笑了一下間道。</p>
<p>「我以爲一定是這樣的。」</p>
<p>「那是好極了。那麼，我們現在下去罷。」他立刻站起來。</p>
<p>「米恩嚷道，」停止！不要這樣做！」但是魯遜拿起手　向　自己的腦袋開火，轟然一聲，鮮血迸流，他的身軀慢慢地倚　　躺下去。</p>
<p>米恩無精打采地注視着他的屍體，還是身體靠緊梯子。下面的人一齊嚷呌起來。他閉緊眼睛，呌這：「已經妥當了，現在用不着着急了。」</p>
<p>米恩走入汽車裏的時候，警官交一封信給他，但他根本沒有閑心注意到這些，他簡直忘記了這一會事，等到回到家裏去的時候，摩一摩袋，才記起來。</p>
<p>信封上寫着送給米恩大夫的。米恩看了，覺很傷心，但這顯然不是魯遜在後來的時候寫的。他把信封撕開看看，裏面有四張一鎊和兩張十先令的鈔票。</p>
<p>他看了許久，才把它再放入信封裏，擺入袋裏，然後閉起眼睛來。他整夜未眠，當然疲倦到再不能支持了。（完）</p>
<h3>新聞人物　華僑鉅子胡文虎</h3>
<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>胡文虎到了上海。</p>
<p>此行目的，據胡氏說：是晋京向蔣主席致敬，並報告海外華僑情形，此外，並將訪謁宋院長及俞財長，對胡氏所主持下的福建經建公司今後　展，有所請示。</p>
<p>有幾張報上，說胡氏喜歡欣賞平劇及各種地方劇，並且說他曾到共舞臺去看過機關佈量戲，一家夜報上做了這樣一個標題：「胡文虎看七劍十三俠」，不啻替共舞臺做了一則義務廣告。</p>
<p>想起了萬金油</p>
<p>提起胡文虎·便會想起虎標永安堂出品的萬金油，八封丹，頭痛粉來。「虎標永安堂」便是胡氏一手經營起來的，到現在仰光，爪哇，暹羅，香港，廣州，上海，漢口，福州，天津等處都設有分行，　界各大埠也有特約經理處，行銷的盛况，確是不可多得。但是胡氏當年開始經營的時候，據傳曾由胡氏親率　　們，披了五彩老虎衣，向各行號宣傳兜售慘澹經營，卒以起家，成爲海外鉅商，着實不是容易的事。</p>
<p>胡祖籍福建永定，但出生却在緬甸的仰光。他的父親在民國紀元前五十年，就乘了大眼鷄船，（因當時帆船船頭畫兩大眼，故名。）隻身赴仰光，創設永安堂國藥號，娶妻李氏，生了文虎文豹兄弟二人。</p>
<p>胡氏實性慷爽，對一般慈善公益事業，莫不竭力資助，與「善棍」之流直不可相提並論。他在海外各地倡辦中學，供僑胞子弟求學　　築醫　，建　　老院等，爲　胞　　不淺。允足書者，爲胡氏對國事的關懷：北伐，九一八，一二八等諸役，每决都捐助巨金，及大量藥品。抗戰期間，對祖國的資助也不少。</p>
<p>到上海辦報紙</p>
<p>有人說：胡氏這次到上海來，想籌備出版星字系報紙上海版，名星滬日報，　之胡氏　　　事業的「頗感　　」此舉　　　　·胡文虎的辦報，始於民國十年，在仰光斥資五萬元，創辦緬甸晨報，民國十七年，在星加坡斥責五十萬元，創辦星洲日報，獨霸星埠報界·民二十年又在汕頭創辦星華日報。以胡氏資本的雄厚。辦報當然頗有成功的希望。</p>
<p>在屋加坡的巴絲　讓地方，胡氏曾獨資開過一個規模大的游泳塲，塲內附設籃球塲，網球塲，羽球塲等塲口掛有「僅許華人入內游泳」的牌示。這與昔日上海「狗與華人不得入內」的牌示兩相一比，正是反映成越。</p>
<p>胡氏今年已六十四歲了，但是精　健旺如昔，看來還有好幾番事業將待完成呢！</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The 46th meeting of the Central Executive Committee was held at 4:00 PM on the 20th in the National Government conference room. More than thirty members of the Central Executive Committee attended, with the Director-General presiding in person. The major resolutions were as follows:</p>

It was resolved that the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.</p>
<p>2.  The draft amendment to the National Government Organization Law was submitted by the Acting Chairman of the National Government for public resolution and implementation. It was resolved to pass the amendment. Key points of the amendment are reported as follows: (1) Article 10: The Chairman of the National Government shall be one person, elected by the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.

Other amendments include the appointment of legislative and supervisory committee members, who shall be nominated by the Chairman of the National Government and appointed after deliberation and resolution by the National Government Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] After the adjournment of the Central Executive Committee meeting on the afternoon of the 20th, a temporary meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council was convened, presided over by Chairman Chiang. The meeting discussed the "Draft Amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law" submitted by the Chairman. The content involves changing the Ministry of Communications into two ministries: Transportation and Posts and Telecommunications. The Land Administration Bureau, Health Administration Bureau, and Water Conservancy Commission will all be upgraded to independent ministries. In accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), political affairs committee members will be established within the Executive Yuan, increasing the number of ministries and commissions to eighteen. The full text was slightly amended and passed immediately, adjourning at 8:00 PM. The full text of the proposal is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Proposal submitted for discussion) Due to the excessively broad responsibilities of the Ministry of Communications, it is proposed to establish two ministries: Posts and Telecommunications, responsible for postal and telegraphic affairs, and Transportation, responsible for water, land, and air transportation affairs. Furthermore, given the importance of water conservancy, health, and land administration at the beginning of national construction, it is proposed to upgrade the Water Conservancy Commission, Land Administration Bureau, and Health Administration Bureau to independent ministries to enhance administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>The establishment of various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan is originally stipulated in Article 1 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law. It is now proposed to amend this article and include the PCC's resolution to establish political affairs committee members in the Executive Yuan in Article 2. Since the Resources Commission has been transferred, it should also be added. The remaining articles of the Executive Yuan Organization Law pertain to the internal organization of the Executive Yuan and can be listed in accordance with the draft amendment proposed by the Yuan in December of last year. Other points in the PCC resolution related to the Executive Yuan should be stipulated in the National Government Organization Law as per precedent, and need not be repeated in the Executive Yuan Organization Law. The draft amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law should be submitted for public resolution, then forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review and submission to the government for promulgation and implementation.</p>

<h3>Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Expand Offensive, Invading Suqian County from Lianshui and Shuyang</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 19th] Chen Yi, Xu Xiangqian, Su Yu, and other communist generals convened an emergency military meeting on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 20th] It is reported that communist forces from Lianshui and Shuyang have been actively expanding their offensive in northern Jiangsu in recent days and have now invaded Suqian County.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 19th] Communist forces from Jiangsu and Shandong have been attacking Nationalist troops continuously. Over 10,000 communist troops near Luoma Lake in Suqian launched a fierce attack on Dachang Chatou Town in multiple directions on the 17th, and crossed the Grand Canal westward to attack Zahe Town. Another force of over 5,000 communist troops attacked Zhangshan Town, 25 miles north of Suqian, from Gaochang. Over 1,000 communist troops infiltrated Caishuangwei, five miles west of Suqian, on the 18th. On the 17th, over 2,000 communist troops infiltrated Chuanjia Village, 30 miles northwest of Zaozhuang. Zhang Guangzhong, commander of the Communist Shandong Southern Military Region, led over 3,000 troops to infiltrate Aihu in Yixian County, attempting to cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Questions: Seats for Communist Party and Democratic League Representatives in the National Assembly Will Be Reserved; Pacification Zone Political Affairs Conference Concludes Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 3:30 PM in the National Assembly Party Representatives Lounge. About 200 people attended, including Peng Xuepei, Shen Yi, Ye Gongchao, Behr, and Chinese and foreign reporters. Peng first introduced the newly appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, who reported on the initial administrative policies for Nanjing. Then, they answered reporters' questions, adjourning around 5:00 PM. The following is a record of Minister Peng's answers:</p>
<p>Question: A spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) stated that Nationalist troop movements in northern Shaanxi are frequent, aircraft fly over Yan'an from time to time, and the highway north of Xi'an is being actively repaired, claiming that Nationalist troops are about to attack Yan'an. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: This kind of atmosphere may be a propaganda tactic, and a harbinger of action. It has a relationship with the newly established action committee by the CCP. Yulin has been surrounded for weeks, with communication relying solely on the air force, so it must pass over Yan'an. As for repairing the highway, this is a nationwide effort, and traffic north of Xi'an cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>Question: Please tell us frankly, is the government planning to attack Yan'an?</p>
<p>Answer: The previous answer already contained a negative response.</p>
<p>Question: There are rumors that Chairman Chiang recently convened a meeting of high-ranking Nationalist generals from various locations, stating that the communist forces would be eliminated in five months, and communism in China would be wiped out in five years. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: This rumor may refer to the recent Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee meeting. Premier Song and Minister Bai served as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. The task of the committee is to plan for the rehabilitation and relief in the pacification zones. Attendees included personnel from relevant central ministries and military and political officials from various pacification areas. It was not a meeting of all high-ranking generals. For example, Chief of Staff Chen did not attend. The Chairman attended the meeting to give instructions, but such speculation about the content of the instructions is not worth denying. The meeting has continued for three days and will conclude on the 21st.</p>
<p>Question: Do you know if Chairman Chiang exchanged documents with Zhang Junmai?</p>
<p>Answer: Correspondence is normal. What I can tell you is that there is a high possibility that the China Democratic Socialist Party (MinSheDang) will attend the National Assembly. Looking back to the establishment of the first National Political Council in 1938, the members included those without party affiliation, with the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), the Communist Party, the China Youth Party and the MinSheDang (then known as the National Socialist Party) as the main constituents. Subsequently, the Democratic League was established, mainly composed of the Youth Party and the MinSheDang, mixed with educational groups and a few individuals. The current situation is similar to that of 1938. Only the Communist Party opposes participation in the National Assembly. We are very pleased with the participation of the educational sector, non-affiliated individuals, and Mongolian compatriots in the National Assembly to jointly draft the constitution, and the delegates welcome them.</p>
<p>Question: Did the Democratic Governance Party led by Situ Meitang secure seats in the National Assembly?</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Situ has been invited to attend the National Assembly as an overseas Chinese citizen.</p>
<p>Question: Since the Communist Party and the Democratic League are not participating in the National Assembly, will the government allocate their seats to other parties?</p>
<p>Answer: No. The seats of representatives from the Communist Party and the Democratic League will absolutely be reserved.</p>
<p>Question: Is the reorganization of the National Government Committee underway?</p>
<p>Answer: The work of various parties participating in the National Assembly has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Question: There is a proposal among the National Assembly representatives to move the capital to Peiping (Beijing). It is said that the Nanjing City Councilors opposed this after listening to the proposal and are preparing to march in protest. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not heard this news. Chairman Chen Yusheng has never mentioned this matter. (Speeches by Ye Gongchao and Shen Yi can be found on page two.)</p>

<h3>Sino-British Trade Treaty Under Negotiation; Our Side is Studying the Draft; Government Has Not Yet Taken Over Dalian City</h3>
<p>Ye Gongchao Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Ye Gongchao, Director of the European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported on the latest developments at a press conference with Chinese and foreign reporters this afternoon, regarding the Sino-British trade negotiations and the implementation negotiations of the Sino-French-Vietnamese agreement. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: A Peiping dispatch reported that Soviet troops have withdrawn from Dalian and that the city has been taken over by Chinese Communist troops. Have the Soviet troops withdrawn? What is the situation in Dalian? What news does the Chinese government have?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding this matter, the Chinese government has not received any reports. The Soviet government notified our country on May 23rd of this year, stating that the Soviet troops had completed their withdrawal from the Northeast on May 3rd. Since that time, Soviet troops should no longer be stationed in Dalian, as the Sino-Soviet treaty signed last August does not allow the Soviet Union to station troops in Dalian. The area near Dalian is still occupied by communist troops, and the Chinese government has not taken over Dalian, so we have no further news.</p>
<p>Question: What is the situation regarding the Sino-British trade negotiations?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the Sino-British negotiations for a trade treaty and related agreements, the British side submitted an initial draft to the Chinese government six months ago. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the draft. Some clauses in the draft involve other relevant government departments, and all parties are studying the relevant clauses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes to complete this draft by the end of this month, but because it is so broad, it may take a little longer. However, both the Chinese and British governments hope that the agreement can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the Sino-French-Vietnamese negotiations, the previous Yunnan Provincial Assembly put forward six points. How is the implementation negotiation of the Sino-French-Vietnamese agreement progressing?</p>
<p>Answer: The Sino-French negotiations can be described in four key points: (1) Recovering the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is a consistent policy of the government. The government has always valued the opinions of all parties in diplomatic negotiations, and the opinions of the Yunnan Provincial Assembly are naturally valued by the government. (2) The issue of Haiphong Port as a free port is being negotiated with the French side. Progress has been made, and absolute success is expected. (3) Compensation for losses of public and private materials crossing the border during the war is being negotiated. Because it involves investigation, valuation, and currency value determination, it will take a longer time. (4) Regarding the protection of overseas Chinese, the government is paying close attention. At the same time, the government is negotiating with both France and Vietnam. Once the negotiations are successful, overseas Chinese will not only be protected after implementation but will also enjoy better treatment than before. This can be stated with certainty.</p>
<h3>Shen Yi Reports on Nanjing's Administrative Policy at Press Conference; Implementing Principles of Focusing on the Big Picture and Starting with the Small Details</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] At a press conference held by the Ministry of Information, Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi reported on the initial administrative policy, stating briefly: For municipal construction, we will adhere to the principle of focusing on the big picture and starting with the small details. The big picture is to complete the general preparations for local autonomy and urban planning. The small details are to repair roads and waterways. In between are facilitating transportation and solving housing and school shortages. And the smallest details are to clean up dilapidated alleys and remote areas and even add public toilets, etc. He also said that the conditions for successful administration are the diligence and effort of municipal government staff, the sincere assistance of citizens, the understanding and support of the central government, and the guidance and supervision of public opinion. He then answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Is Nanjing's construction goal Chinese style, Western style, or a combination of Chinese and Western styles?</p>
<p>Answer: Regardless of Chinese or Western, the goal is a modernized city.</p>
<p>Question: What is Mayor Shen's view on the dance ban in Nanjing?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a very minor matter of municipal administration. Since all parties are paying attention and the Municipal Council will also discuss it, we should first listen to everyone's opinions.</p>

<p>Answer: Thank you for your concern about the difficulty of balancing Nanjing's income and expenditure. This cannot be solved by discussing taxes alone, but we must also find a way to solve it.</p>

<h3>Qingdao Accepts Embezzlement Case; District Court Files Public Prosecution</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Police Kick Hawker to Death; Evidence of Guilt is Conclusive; But May Be Found Not Guilty Under British Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] The case of Indian police officer Seth kicking Wang Shuixiang, a peanut hawker, to death was heard this afternoon. The courtroom was crowded with spectators and heavily guarded. Four Chinese were called to testify, one of whom testified that the defendant police officer kicked the deceased ten times after he fell to the ground. Dr. Howell of the Hong Kong Government Hospital found that Wang Shuixiang's death was due to internal bleeding and a ruptured spleen. Dr. Howell also stated that the bruises on Wang Shuixiang's body were undoubtedly caused by being kicked by the defendant's leather boots.</p>
<p>Based on the prosecutor's indictment and the questioning of witnesses, the defendant may be acquitted or receive only a light sentence under the protection of the British court. The prosecutor first stated that he was only presenting the facts related to the case to the court and said that there were contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses, but the court had to make a judgment. When questioning the police officer responsible for examining the deceased's body who testified, the prosecutor raised the question that the bruises on the deceased's body may have been caused by falling on a peanut basket. The deceased died from a ruptured spleen which had enlarged four times, and he could have been saved if he had been sent to the hospital earlier. The case was adjourned for further hearing on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>

<h3>Taipei's Big Thief Wu Shengcai Captured; One of the "Twelve Constellations," Nicknamed "Dog"; Discovered and Surrounded by Secret Agents While Watching a Movie</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Wu Shengcai, a well-known big thief in Taipei, was recently captured while watching the American detective movie "The Invisible Thief" at the Xinmin Theater. There are twelve famous big thieves in Taipei, known as the "Twelve Constellations," and Wu Shengcai is one of them, nicknamed "Dog." The nicknames of the other eleven are "Pig," "Cow," "Sheep," etc. They formed gangs and committed countless crimes. Wu Shengcai was particularly vicious. Two months ago, he confronted the military police and injured a police officer. For several days, two theaters here have been screening the upper and lower parts of "The Invisible Thief." The protagonist in the film, named "Ghost," is a shocking and unprecedented big thief who uses new scientific inventions, namely radio waves, to become invisible and commit robberies. He appears and disappears suddenly, making it impossible to see or defeat him. Wu Shengcai apparently became interested in this "American big thief" and went to the Xinmin Theater to watch the movie. Shortly after entering, he was discovered by a police station secret agent. When more than 20 military police rushed to surround and capture him, he jumped out of the theater, climbed onto the roof, and fired four shots to warn against being captured. Seeing that the military police were everywhere and there was no way to escape, he returned to the theater, took off his clothes, and hid under the seat, where he was then found. In the movie, the American big thief is ultimately electrocuted to death. He is now in prison, and it is feared that he will also face certain death.</p>

<h3>New Conscription Law</h3>
<p>Analysis of Key Implementation Points by the Ministry of National Defense</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense, in order to avoid difficulties for the implementing agencies when handling conscription matters after the promulgation and implementation of the new Conscription Law by the National Government, has made the following analysis: (1) For counties and cities that have completed the investigation of men and women of conscription age, strict implementation should be carried out in accordance with Article 19 of the Conscription Law. (2) Counties and cities that have completed the investigation of men of conscription age should complete the conscription during the expedited period. Regarding the conscription years, if the conscription-age sons are insufficient to meet the allocated conscription quota, the age limit may be appropriately extended in order to avoid affecting social order. (3) Before the promulgation of the Implementing Regulations of the New Conscription Law, previous laws and regulations that do not conflict with the law are still valid. The above three items have been notified to all garrison districts across the country by the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<h3>Media Outlets Everywhere Unanimously Request Reduction or Exemption of Newspaper Postage and Electricity Fees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Since the authorities increased postal and telegraphic fees by five to ten times from November 1st, newspaper businesses nationwide have suffered a serious impact. A copy of a newspaper subscribed to from other locations by airmail costs 230,000 yuan per month, causing hardship for both newspaper publishers and readers. Therefore, media circles in Wuhan, Shanghai, and the Shandong Provisional Assembly have all stated their reasons and telegraphed requests to the authorities for reductions or exemptions to benefit cultural development. Fifteen newspaper businesses in Nanjing, including Central, Heping (Peace), and Jiuguo (National Salvation), jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Transportation the day before yesterday, requesting that newspaper postal and telegraphic fees continue to be charged at the standard before October 31st. Meanwhile, representatives from the same industry across the country who are participating in the National Assembly are exchanging opinions and discussing methods to facilitate unified action.

The rumored incidents of insults by our side are completely inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>Formulation of the Northeast's 36th Year Governance Program</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 19th] The Political Committee of the Northeast Headquarters has recently formulated the governance program for various places in Northeast China for the 36th year.

For the unrecovered areas, it stipulates six items with the goal of preparing for the recovery. Also, please extend the training deadline.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Chairman's Headquarters Arranges for Unemployed Military Officers</h3>
<p>Also, please extend the training deadline.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] In recent days, thousands of unemployed military officers have gathered in Chongqing City, requesting the Chongqing branch of the Central Training Corps to admit them for training. The Chongqing Headquarters has therefore transferred an order to the Central Training Corps to appropriately relax the admission standards and suggested to the Ministry of National Defense that the registration and admission of unemployed military officers be extended again until the end of this year (originally scheduled to end on June 30th) so that a small number of genuine unemployed regular military officers can be admitted for training. Those who forge documents or impersonate others will be handled according to the law. Xiao Yisu, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, convened a meeting with more than 300 unemployed military officers in Chongqing at 2:00 PM on the 19th. In addition to instructing them to wait quietly for the Central Training Corps to review their applications, he temporarily issued each officer a food allowance of 10,000 yuan and 30 catties of rice. Housing was allocated by the Fourth Supply District at the Nan'an Rehabilitation Station for temporary residence. The officers expressed satisfaction with these measures by the authorities and have left the urban area in groups to wait for review on the Nan'an.</p>
<h3>Military Personnel Must Not Interfere with Road Administration</h3>
<p>Orders from the Ministry of National Defense to pay attention</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense stated that during the War of Resistance, various transportation arteries suffered numerous damages from military conflicts. Although active repairs were carried out after the victory to restore traffic, the simple and crude repairs made difficulties inevitable. Recently, some military personnel who do not understand the truth have frequently interfered, and incidents of assaulting station staff have occurred from time to time. In order to prevent this, the ministry has specifically ordered all responsible supervisors to strictly discipline their subordinates and pay close attention to this matter. In the future, matters related to traffic operations should be absolutely subject to the handling of the responsible personnel of each station section, and no further interference should be made.</p>
<h3>Fujian Fuqing County Cracks Down on Counterfeit Taiwan Dollar Printing Organization</h3>

<h3>Editorial: Establishing a New National Ethos</h3>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan temporarily suspended the review of the draft constitutional amendment due to procedural issues, all parties have paid great attention to the constitutional draft issue. The drafting of the constitutional amendment was originally based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). Whether this amendment will be submitted to the National Assembly is not only related to the credibility of the government but also to the future of the overall situation. For this reason, this newspaper has previously commented on the constitutional draft issue, believing that the drafting of a Three Principles of the People constitution has no precedent to follow, and everything is a pioneering effort. The drafting of the May 5th Constitution took great effort and fully reflected the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. However, whether the system it established is the most reasonable in light of the evolution of the past decade, especially in recent years, is also questionable. As for the amended constitutional draft that the government plans to submit to the National Assembly, it still adheres to the solemn stance of the Three Principles of the People while complying with the resolutions of the PCC and should serve as the basis for the National Assembly to formulate the constitution. As for the procedural issues, as long as the Central Standing Committee makes a resolution, it can be made compliant with the regulations in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Now, the Central Standing Committee has indeed passed the constitutional amendment and handed it over to the Legislative Yuan to quickly complete the legislative procedure. At the same time, it also passed the National Government Organization Law Amendment. The Supreme National Defense Council also passed the Executive Yuan Organization Law Amendment. The contents of each proposal all comply with the spirit of the PCC resolutions. The passage of this motion can, on the one hand, enable the Legislative Yuan to review the constitutional amendment in accordance with the legal procedures, complete the review in a timely manner, and submit it to the National Assembly. On the other hand, it shows the people of the country how the government will abide by its promises and resolutely adopt the resolutions passed by the PCC. All absurd talk can be disproved by the Central Standing Committee's resolution this time. The government values its own promises and will not easily allow them to be changed. Unless it is outside of the fundamental stance, the central government's impartiality should indeed move people from all parties and factions, even those without any affiliation. The outdated notion that "only by believing in our doctrine can you be our citizen" may still linger in the minds of some people, but it can never represent a political group that is truly dedicated to serving the public. Only those political groups that outwardly advocate democracy but actually have no individual freedom and worship collectivism have such a terrible notion.</p>
<p>The National Government Organization Law Amendment passed by the Central Standing Committee stipulates that in addition to the Chairman of the National Government being elected by the Central Standing Committee, there will be forty members of the National Government Committee, including people from both within and outside the party, and the power of the National Government Committee will be expanded. At the same time, the Executive Yuan Organization Law Amendment passed by the Supreme National Defense Council stipulates that in addition to changing the Ministry of Transportation to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, three new ministries will be established: the Ministry of Land Administration, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Health. There will also be political affairs commissioners. All these resolutions follow the spirit of the PCC resolutions, which shows the government's determination to comply with and implement the PCC resolutions. Due to the passage of this amendment, the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan to accommodate people from all parties and factions, even those without any affiliation, will be accelerated. We hope that all parties can further cooperate sincerely to make the organization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan more substantial, so as to establish a new model of democratic unity. The future of the nation will thus gain more hope.</p>
<h3>Rectifying Border Politics Must Not Be Overlooked</h3>
<p>When the domestic situation presents new opportunities due to the convening of the National Assembly, we must not neglect the news and intentions coming from the border regions. A few days ago, the Inner Mongolian representatives to the National Assembly, all Inner Mongolian senators to the Political Participation Council, and other Mongolian and Xinjiang figures gathered in Beijing and issued a declaration demanding autonomy and requesting the central government to thoroughly implement the Second Plenary Session's resolution on border politics and to revitalize border governance. At the same time, according to a United Press report from Los Angeles, the Xinjiang issue seems to be resurfacing, and the old dream of the "East Turkistan People's Republic" is showing signs of revival. The reliability of this report from Los Angeles across the Pacific is questionable. In our judgment, the former report inevitably exaggerates the situation and is not necessarily credible. However, since there is such a report, it is indeed worthy of our vigilance.</p>
<p>The importance of valuing our border politics is beyond our need to emphasize. Xinjiang and Mongolia serve as the northern and northwestern barriers of our country. At this time, it is certainly worthy of our attention. In the past eight years, some parts of Mongolia and Xinjiang were occupied and suffered from the aggression of Japanese warlords. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, they were subjected to the rule of armed forces other than the National Army and the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, just as they were celebrating the recovery of their homeland, they suffered from another violent rule. Therefore, we should express our utmost sympathy and consolation to our compatriots in Mongolia and Xinjiang. The central government cared about the border people and dispatched Mongolian Banner Comfort Missions after Japan's surrender last year. Due to the recent developments in the situation, the Mongolia and Xinjiang areas have inevitably suffered from the impact of unrest. According to news from foreign news agencies, one report said that the Outer Mongolian troops are currently concentrating on the border area of Chahar Province; another report said that the Outer Mongolian Military Bureau is currently taking strict measures to prevent anyone from crossing the border from Chahar Province into Outer Mongolia. Although the accuracy of these reports remains to be confirmed, the unrest in the Mongolia border situation seems undeniable.</p>
<p>At this time, we see voices from Mongolian figures demanding autonomy. According to news reports, the Mongolian compatriots' demand for autonomy is not for separation, but for the government to fulfill the promises it has made to the Mongolian people time and time again. We believe that this statement comes from the hearts of our Mongolian Banner compatriots. The Mongolian Banner compatriots face Outer Mongolia across the Gobi Desert and know the actual situation of Outer Mongolia more clearly. Moreover, they also know the violence of the Chinese Communist Party's rule. Therefore, their minds are inward, not for separation. We admire the Mongolian Banner compatriots for being able to express themselves so frankly. The central government's attention to border politics has important resolutions in the Second Plenary Session. One is that under the principle of forming a unified democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People and the May 5th Constitution, the constitution must clearly stipulate guaranteeing the rights and interests of border ethnic groups. The other is that the members of the National Government Committee and the political affairs commissioners of the Executive Yuan after the reorganization must include loyal and capable continuers of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups. Furthermore, capable people from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups must have ample opportunities to participate in the actual work of various departments and commissions. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission will be reorganized into the Ministry of Border Affairs, so that capable people from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups can participate in actual work and assume actual responsibilities. In the education of all levels in the border ethnic areas, emphasis should be placed on the native language. Reasonable regulations should be made for the autonomous system in the border areas according to the actual situation of each place. Regarding the Inner Mongolia portion, the original Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee will be restored, and the powers and limits of the league banner government and the provincial and county boundaries will be clearly divided. This newspaper has previously commented on these decisions, believing that "the resolutions of this Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang not only expanded the opportunities for border compatriots to participate in the central government, but also focused on supporting the autonomy of border compatriots and maintaining the inherent cultural life of border compatriots, which not only shows the central government's concern for border compatriots, but also opens up a broad avenue for their future development." Unfortunately, after the Second Plenary Session, the domestic situation still failed to move towards peace, so the aforementioned decisions could not be implemented. Now that the situation has changed, and the Mongolian compatriots have demands for autonomy, we urge the central government to implement the decisions. We uphold the central government's virtuous intention to care for the border people and sympathize with the Mongolian compatriots' experiences. Therefore, we hope that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session on border politics will be implemented in a timely and gradual manner to satisfy the border people's longing.</p>
<p>As for the Xinjiang portion, the news from the United States is not necessarily credible, as we have said before. However, we cannot help but reiterate here that the central government, based on the Three Principles of the People of the revolution, aims to coordinate the border people and stabilize the frontiers. In January of this year, the eleven-article text of the reconciliation agreement for the Yining dispute was signed, and in June of this year, two additional articles were established. At the same time, the organization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government was expanded, and members from various ethnic groups residing in Xinjiang were appointed as committee members. It can be seen that the central government is doing its best to support the autonomy of the border people and to satisfy all the wishes of the border people that can be satisfied. This enlightened policy should be supported by the border people. Therefore, how to harmonize all ethnic groups, eliminate suspicions, and achieve sincere cooperation should be the focus of the unified efforts of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Due to the transmission of the aforementioned reports, we reiterate our views in particular. We hope that the people of the country will encourage each other.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] Chairman Shen is scheduled to inspect Wenzhou and Taizhou via the Shanghai sea route on Tuesday, the 26th, for a month. After returning to Hangzhou, he plans to inspect Xinchang and other counties. In January next year, he will visit various counties under his jurisdiction to complete the performance evaluations of all counties in the province, explore the people's conditions, and use them as a reference for new policies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] Chairman Shen is scheduled to go to Shanghai and then to Wenzhou on the 21st. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, he convened a meeting with the principals and deans of various middle schools in Hangzhou. Director Li of the Education Department also attended to review middle school education in Hangzhou. He said that the post-war recovery is nearing its end, and the responsibility for spiritual construction is heavy. Only by understanding each other can we overcome this difficulty. However, Hangzhou schools have insufficient material conditions, and the youth are tame but lack energy. There is education without entertainment, and group strength is too poor. Although Zhejiang Province has many famous scholars, the general cultural level is low, feudal concepts are strong, and morality and learning have declined, leading to educational failure. Therefore, Mr. Shen loudly called for promoting moral education and revitalizing the people's hearts, which must also start from this. He also made some statements regarding school management matters.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] According to reports, Zhejiang Province has only collected over 200,000 shi of grain so far.

It is planned to allocate 700 tons for water conservancy and the rest for transportation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] The results of the Zhejiang county magistrate examination may be announced before the end of the month. Previously, Linhai, Lanxi, Changshan, and other counties requested to allow the popular election of county magistrates, and the Provincial Senate also approved it. However, this must be handled by the central government in conjunction with other cases. Therefore, Chairman Shen said that it will not be done this year, but may be discussed at length next year.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau recently decided to completely repair the seawall in the next two years, and then begin the fundamental management project of the Qiantang River from 1948 (Republic Year 37), aiming to complete the project within three years, so that the downstream riverbed of the Qian River can be fixed and the disaster of the seawall collapsing will not occur again. The "Juezi" number seawall in Haining was destroyed. The bureau decided to build a new concrete seawall 30 meters long on the original site. Before it is completed, a brushwood embankment will be built first to avoid negligence. The brushwood embankment project has already begun. As for the equipment needed to build the new concrete seawall, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is shipping it from Shanghai and it can also be put into operation within days. After the completion of this seawall, a 150-meter water barrier will also be added to prevent the river from approaching the base of the seawall and ensure safety. As for the collapse of the Xiaoshan Nan River, the bureau has also drafted a plan for rushing repairs, intending to stop the embankment first to prevent the tide from invading. However, according to past practice, the local people must repair it themselves, and the Seawall Engineering Bureau can only assist from the side.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Cloth Factories Request Cotton Yarn Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] There are as many as forty-two weaving factories in Suzhou, and the demand for cotton yarn is quite large. However, in the past six months, due to the depletion of cotton yarn stocks, all factories have had to purchase from the black market. The prices are high, the purchases are not easy, and the costs have increased, resulting in sluggish sales of products. Therefore, cloth prices have fallen from time to time, and the factories have suffered huge losses, feeling that they cannot maintain operations. This is an unprecedented crisis for the Suzhou cloth factory industry. Wu Zhenshan, Chairman of the Cloth Factory Industry Association, recently heard that fellow weaving factories in Shanghai have obtained a general allocation of cotton yarn. On the 18th, he urgently telegraphed the county chamber of commerce, requesting that it consider the difficult and precarious situation of all Suzhou cloth factories and promptly forward the request to the Shanghai Textile Industry Management Committee to instruct the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Industry Association to allocate cotton yarn nearby, following the example of fellow cloth factories in Shanghai and Changzhou, in order to maintain production.</p>

<h3>Public Buses Incite Passengers to Curse</h3>
<p>The Nanshi district after the war has been washed by artillery fire quite miserably, but at present there are already several places under construction of new houses, and the number of homes and shops has also increased compared to before, so the market is gradually recovering prosperity. For the convenience of citizens' transportation, the municipal authorities have public bus facilities, and the general salaried employees and working-class people are all pleased and find it convenient. However, it has recently been rumored that when these buses come, four or five of them connect one after another, and they drive away quickly without opening the doors when they arrive at the station, leaving passengers who have been waiting for a long time unable to board.</p>
<p>One day last month, the writer happened to finish a meeting at the General Labor Union and felt quite tired. When he arrived at Xiaobeimen, he planned to take Route 6, but waited for about fifteen minutes without seeing a bus coming. Just as he was getting impatient, he saw three or five of them driving up at the same time. When the buses arrived at the station, the first bus drove away without opening its doors because it was already full of passengers. The passengers on the second bus surged to the door before the bus had stopped. The passengers inside the bus were sparser than on the previous bus. The driver and ticket seller shouted, "There are empty buses in the back!" Before they could finish speaking, the bus had already started moving. As a result, the general passengers rushed to the buses in the back. The bus carriages were naturally much emptier than the previous two buses, but the ticket sellers shouted "Empty in the back" in unison, and at the same time, with a blow of the whistle, the three buses chased after them like they were flying away. The general passengers showed disappointment and hatred as they cursed: "Damn it! I can walk myself," "Run, run!" Several people who could not wait any longer cursed and ran away. As the sky gradually darkened, the writer was fortunate enough to be returning home in the evening. Since he had nothing to do, he decided to wait a bit longer, and at the same time, he took the opportunity to watch the skilled little technicians repairing three-wheeled vehicles by the roadside, making it a source of amusement in his boredom. Unconsciously, he waited for another ten minutes, and four buses drove up in a row. The first and second buses were packed with passengers, so they drove away without stopping. The third and fourth buses were relatively empty. The passengers rushed to the doors before the buses had stopped, but as before, the ticket seller pointed to the back and shouted, "Empty buses are coming in the back!" At this time, the maintainer could not help but sigh secretly, and then heard the passengers cursing endlessly, "Chinese people can never do things well!" This sentence made people hear "It's too sad!" Although the writer is just a small civil servant, he absolutely hopes that the people after the victory will still have such a contemptuous evil [attitude] towards state-owned enterprises! Therefore, he raises the following points, hoping that Director Zhao and the responsible personnel in the transportation department will pay attention to and improve them. (1) If the buses arrive at the same time in connection, is it that the ticket sellers have a role in making the ticket inspectors unable to take care of both ends? (2) If there are vacant spots in the bus, why don't you open the door to accommodate passengers when you arrive at the station? (3) Since Laoximen is the starting point, why doesn't the manager of the dispatch dispatch the buses at evenly spaced intervals so that several buses can be dispatched at the same time? (4) In Shanghai, where transportation tools are competing with foreign countries, the drivers and ticket sellers should have the necessary politeness to improve the passengers. If there is no substantial training, there is no superiority or inferiority from those run by foreign merchants, then the leakage of passengers taking the foreign merchants' vehicles every day, over time, cannot be said to be a loss to the country. (5) It is best to appoint a few mobile inspectors to check whether the drivers and ticket sellers are on duty and can give passengers assistance when getting on and off the bus. (6) If any business does not have sufficient remuneration in life, malpractice and disloyal duties are prone to occur, so the treatment of service personnel should also be rationalized, otherwise, even if the above points can be improved, it is only a symptomatic but not a root cause, because work efficiency is embedded in work mood, and service spirit is contained in service interest (Zhang Zhi)</p>
<p>Looking back on the sudden outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the Japanese pirates took advantage of the opportunity to land at Jinshanwei Haikou (November 5th of that year), and almost the entire southeastern half fell into the hands of the enemy pirates. Therefore, after painfully reflecting on it, it seems that the collapse of the Jinshanwei coastal defense should be considered the most serious and painful. According to Jinshanwei City, it was built by Qi Jiguang during the Ming Dynasty to defend against Japanese pirates. Unexpectedly, more than 300 years later, [the] same [Japanese] pirates broke through the gate and rushed in. Therefore, in order to alert the people to pay attention to coastal defense and refine the navy, in order to commemorate the major damage suffered during this war of resistance, and in order to mourn the lives and property sacrificed due to the sudden loss of Jinshanwei, it seems that something should be expressed. Perhaps a road should be designated in one of our country's major cities and named Jinshanwei Road (it is most appropriate to rename a street in Shanghai), or a stele should be erected near Jinshanwei City where the Japanese pirates first landed, in order to be vigilant and commemorate, which has profound significance.

<h3>Mail Reply</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Wang Hucheng: Regarding your letter pointing out that a piece of mail was shelved, the Shanghai Postal Administration replied: "It has been found that a regular letter sent from Yin County to Mr. Wang was indeed delayed. The reason is that at present, both this office and the Yin County office have a large number of mails received and dispatched, which has caused the handling to be slower. We have ordered [them] to improve and have sent a letter to the Yin County office to pay attention. However, the war item was indeed properly delivered on the 13th of last month, but it was not delivered on the day when your housemates lived on the same day, resulting in [being] left for one day. Mr. Wang has issued a letter to prove that the post-delivery time often has been misplaced by the concierge or housemates, and this bureau has repeatedly notified the public to pay attention."

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The UN General Assembly held its first vote today among 54 countries and unanimously passed a resolution proposed by Egypt, requesting all governments to "immediately cease religious and so-called racial persecution and discrimination." The only opponent was South African Prime Minister Smuts, who coldly read the newspaper on the sidelines during the General Assembly's discussion of the resolution, presumably because India would present evidence of racial discrimination against South Africa.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss Egypt's proposal on racial and religious discrimination. Egyptian representative Audian first spoke, saying that Egypt's proposal could be seen as a "symbol of good triumphing over evil." The Polish representative expressed direct endorsement and said that Poland has suffered greatly from racial discrimination. Soviet representative Vyshinsky also strongly supported the proposal, but said that the proposal was too abstract and could not point out practical ways to oppose exclusion. At this point, Chinese</p>
<p>Dr. Wellington Koo stood up and said that the proposal put forward by the Egyptian representative was fully in line with the United Nations Charter, and the Chinese delegation fully expressed its approval. Although this proposal does not have any specific provisions, there are still many countries that have not respected the concept of human equality, so the Chinese representative expressed unlimited welcome to Egypt's proposal. As for China, it had already respected the principle of human equality 5,000 years ago, and to this day, it has also implemented these principles. There are five different ethnic groups in China, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan, whose beliefs can represent all the religions in the world, but they can still coexist peacefully and live in harmony, which is why China can implement the principle of human equality. China's first teacher, Confucius, said, "All within the four seas are brothers." We always keep Confucius' teachings in mind and earnestly follow them. We deeply hope that the General Assembly will unanimously pass the proposal put forward by Egypt. Soviet representative Vyshinsky expressed that although the Soviet Union will vote for the proposal, it felt that the failure of the proposal to list factual country names and the lack of specific measures to prevent discrimination were shortcomings. US representative Austin and British representative Shawcross also spoke successively in support of the resolution. [Shawcross] also expressed support for Vyshinsky's meaning, pointing out that words and resolutions alone are still not enough, so the United Kingdom always strives to complete the Human Rights Commission in the Taijie Conference to stipulate the code of basic human rights. The Indian representative said that this proposal is a major step in determining the complete equality of human beings, regardless of whether they are white, black, or yellow. He deeply hoped that this proposal would be unanimously passed and that the representatives of all countries would study the situation in their own countries after returning home and try to find ways to remedy any existing discrimination. Finally, French representative Barodie spoke and said that the French representative expressed support for this proposal, but I want to tell you that France has never allowed any racial discrimination. Such discrimination is absolutely inconsistent with the spirit of the French people.</p>
<h3>Security Council Re-elects Members; Colombia, Syria, and Belgium Elected; Social and Economic Council Members US and Lebanon Reelected</h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly elected Colombia, Syria, and Belgium today as non-permanent members of the Security Council for a term of two years. The "UNGA" plenary session also elected Venezuela and New Zealand as members of the Social and Economic Council for a term of three years. The United States and Lebanon were also re-elected to continue their terms. The Social and Economic Council still lacks two seats, but because the voting results were not enough two-thirds, the four candidates (Turkey, Netherlands, Belarus, and Yugoslavia) were not elected. General Assembly Chairman Spaak then announced that it would be decided at the next plenary session. Due to today's election results, the Security Council's eleven members next year will be: the five permanent members (US, UK, China, Soviet Union, France), as well as Australia, Brazil, and Poland (the term of the above three countries will expire at the end of 1947), and Colombia, Syria, and Belgium elected today. Next year, the members of the Economic and Social Council will be: Cuba, Czechoslovakia, India, Norway, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom (the term will expire at the end of 1947), Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, France, Secret (the term will expire at the end of 1948), and the four countries elected today (the United States, Venezuela, Lebanon, and New Zealand) and the two countries not yet elected, whose terms will all end at the end of 1949.</p>
<p>India Failed to be Elected</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th Dispatch] The three countries elected as members of the Security Council were selected by secret ballot. It is reported that India has been vigorously requesting to obtain a seat on the Security Council to replace Egypt, and has received the support of China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. However, India only received 13 votes, ranking fourth and ultimately failing to be elected. The election results show that the membership of the Security Council still maintains the previous regional distribution method. Colombia represents Latin America, Syria represents the Arab group, and Belgium represents Western European countries. Colombia succeeded Mexico's term, Syria succeeded Egypt, and Belgium succeeded the Netherlands. Before the actual election, there were still many behind-the-scenes activities. The results were already predetermined, and the election was just a routine procedure.</p>
<h3>Molotov Advocates Direct Negotiations between Italy and South Tyrol</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] Molotov notified Italy that the Soviet Union advocated direct negotiations between South Tyrol and Italy to resolve the Tete Port and South Tyrol border issues. Molotov said in a letter to Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Garomi (now in New York as a member of the Italian delegation to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference), regarding the position of the Soviet Union by road. Molotov said that the Soviet Union has achieved the proposal proposed by the Xintuo, holding direct negotiations, and said that the Soviet government believes that direct negotiations between Italy and South Tyrol can resolve this issue in the spirit of agreement and restore normal relations between Italy and South Tyrol.</p>
<h3>Saudi Arabia Uses US Loans to Open Commercial Ports in the Persian Gulf and Build a 300-Mile Railway to Connect with the Hinterland</h3>
<p>[United Press Agency, London, 19th] Moscow Radio broadcasted today from Mecca, the Islamic holy city, that Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Sulaiman announced a plan to use the credit loans recently obtained from the United States to build a new port in the Persian Gulf. Sulaiman went to Washington in August of this year and negotiated a loan of 10 million US dollars with the Export-Import Bank for the purchase of goods in the United States. The new port to be built will be connected to the hinterland city of Riyadh by a 300-mile-long railway. Its equipment will all be purchased from the United States. Power plants are planned to be built in Riyadh and Medina, also using American equipment.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Decides on Date of Adjournment</h3>
<p>No Later Than December 11th</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The UN Coordination or Steering Committee held a meeting immediately after the UN General Assembly adjourned today and decided that December 11th would be the final adjournment date for the UN General Assembly, and December 5th would be the final date for the Committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Security Council Meets Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Foreign Troops; the Five Powers Will Discuss the Veto Power</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: The Security Council met this afternoon to discuss the most difficult issue, namely the number of Allied troops stationed in non-enemy countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 20th] The Five Powers are expected to resume discussions today on the plan proposed by China, Britain, and the United States to limit the use of the veto power. The Five Powers meeting was temporarily cancelled yesterday, and the reason was not announced. It is thought that it was because the United Nations was holding a plenary session at the same time, and the foreign ministers could not spare time. Bevin met with Byrnes yesterday morning, presumably to exchange views on the German issue and the Palestinian issue.</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Issue: Six Guiding Principles Determined</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will soon hold a meeting in New York to discuss the German problem. The position that Britain should defend at that time has been clearly defined. Foreign Secretary Bevin is reported to have prepared a memorandum outlining Britain's arguments. In essence, there are the following six points: (1) Britain advocates that Germany should be unified politically and economically under a system that is neither centralized nor federal. (2) Britain believes that Germany's production, as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement, is insufficient. Therefore, Germany should be allowed to produce 11 million tons of steel annually, with the proceeds used to purchase food. (3) Under the current reparations plan, Britain objects to any removal of equipment from Germany by either the Soviet Union or Western countries, even if the Soviet Union proposes installment deductions. Britain will only abandon this view when Germany's production increases sufficiently to cover the costs of Allied occupation and supplies. (4) Britain would prefer to merge the British and American occupation zones rather than enter into an agreement allowing the Soviet Union to remove equipment from Germany as reparations during the period when Germany relies on British supplementation. (5) Britain is still willing to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the control of the Ruhr region's industry within a unified German organization. (6) Britain intends to propose the organization of a central German institution, the establishment of a central civil service corps, and the appointment of local government agencies with the power to make decisions politically, but ultimately subject to the approval of the occupying powers.</p>
<h3>US Drafts Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] US officials are currently drafting a disarmament proposal, which they believe will lead the world towards disarmament and ensure the security of the United States. It is expected that the proposal will be formally submitted to the UN General Assembly at the end of this week or early next week. Authoritative sources say that the draft will require the following points as the price for countries to participate: (1) Effective guarantees that no country will undermine the established goals of disarmament. (2) Guarantees that other countries will implement disarmament to the same extent as the United States and fully fulfill their promises. This plan is the US response to Molotov's disarmament proposals in the UN organization. The plan will be submitted to President Truman for approval before it is released.</p>
<h3>United Nations Control of Narcotics Work</h3>
<p>Draft Approved by the General Assembly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Special Dispatch] At today's meeting of the General Assembly, China, the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and Abyssinia all urged the General Assembly to quickly handle the draft agreement transferring the League of Nations' work on narcotics control to the United Nations. The General Assembly unanimously passed the draft. Guo Taiqi stated in his speech that China has always supported international control of narcotics work, and the Chinese delegation has been very active in the work of establishing a Narcotics Commission. Guo stated that the Chinese government will sign the draft agreement as soon as possible. Also, the General Assembly today unanimously passed the draft, but it will only take effect after it has been signed by more than 35 countries.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang in America</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 19th Special Dispatch] A columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle reports: General Feng Yuxiang recently purchased a house in Berkeley, across from San Francisco, for $19,500. General Feng is also the owner of a 1946 Chrysler.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Results of Romanian General Election: Communist Party Dominates; Minor Bleeding Incidents Occur in Various Places; Romania Assures US of Free Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 20th Broadcast: In the Romanian parliamentary elections, initial results show that the government group controlled by the Communist Party has a great advantage, with the opposition lagging far behind. Both sides accuse each other of irregularities in the election.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 19th] Officials announced tonight that the parliamentary elections were conducted in peace and order, with only a few bleeding incidents caused by opposition instigation, but without results. Voting took place in the capital's central districts, especially in the major factories. Romanian officers and soldiers voted in their barracks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bucharest, 19th] Romania held elections today for a new parliament. The election results will not be announced until noon tomorrow. Troops are ordered to stand guard near polling stations. The key to this election is whether the Communist government led by Groza can retain power. The Communist government advocates strengthening relations with the Soviet Union and establishing a communist social system. The opposition supports maintaining a capitalist system of the middle class.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The State Department announced that Romania has assured the US government that it will respect the democratic principles of freedom and justice in today's elections. Foreign Minister Tătărescu yesterday submitted a reply to the US representative in Bucharest, Barrett, in response to the US note. Tătărescu reiterated that the Romanian government believes the US proposal is an attempt to interfere in Romanian domestic affairs, but at the same time guarantees that the democratic principles of freedom and justice will continue to guide the general election.</p>
<h3>US Coal Miners' Strike Has Significant Impact at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>[United Press, Pittsburgh, 19th] Although the federal court ordered a ban on the bituminous coal miners' strike, the number of strikers continues to increase. Yesterday, 38,000 miners were on strike, and today another 40,000 are on strike, totaling about 78,000. Two hundred and seventy-two coal mines are closed, resulting in a daily reduction of 20% in coal production. Fuel supplies to steel mills have begun to be disrupted, and some mines in those plants are also on strike. Whether a nationwide coal strike will begin will be known on the 21st. Lewis, the former chairman of the Mine Workers Union, has notified the government that the union contract expires on that date. Since the strike ban was issued, Lewis has not made any statement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The War Department announced today that it is prepared to join forces with the Interior Department to intervene in the coal miners' strike, but has not yet received a notice to deploy troops.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the impending national coal miners' strike is a major blow to countries that need US food and coal. If all 400,000 bituminous coal miners in the country go on strike, the export of coal and food will inevitably stop.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of the Interior Krug predicted today that the coal miners' strike would have a huge impact on all aspects of national life. It is said that within 60 days of the strike, it could shut down 64% of publicly owned utilities powered by electricity, 60% of steel mills, 90% of coking plants, 86% of first-class railway companies, 90% of cement plants, and 70% of other factories.</p>
<h3>Presentation of Evidence Against Japanese War Criminals May Not End as Scheduled</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] According to reliable sources today, the US prosecutor at the Far East Tribunal originally hoped to conclude the presentation of evidence related to the 27 Japanese war criminals in early December, but because the British and Philippine prosecutors insisted on presenting all documents of Japanese atrocities, it is feared that it will not be possible to end it as scheduled. Prosecutors from the eleven countries have recently held repeated meetings and attached great importance to the conspiracy charges in the indictment. The indictment accuses the defendants of "planning, instigating, and engaging in a war of aggression." After US Navy Admiral Lee Richardson submits a detailed report on the attack on Pearl Harbor next week, this stage of the indictment can actually be concluded. The US prosecutor believes that only by briefly presenting special examples of Japanese military atrocities can the presentation of the entire case be completed in the second week of December.</p>
<h3>Greek Rebel Forces Gain Momentum; Over 100 Villages in the Northern Border Area Under Their Control; Greek Government Plans to Appeal to the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent in London, 20th] The importance of the war on the border between Greece and Yugoslavia is increasing today, as Greece has announced that it will appeal to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the United Nations to prevent certain countries from participating in the war on the Greek-Yugoslav border. If so, the UN General Assembly, which has not yet achieved much, will encounter new difficulties. According to a British Foreign Office spokesman, the British government has received formal notification from Greece confirming that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia are participating in the war on the Greek border. The British government is considering this notification.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Greek Army Chief of Staff General Spiliotopoulos flew to London on Tuesday to request increased British aid to cope with internal and external troubles.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 19th] The strength of the rebel army in the Western Macedonian region is increasing, and they have occupied 100 villages. They also publish their own newspapers, set up their own courts, and are led by two elementary school teachers. Their headquarters are located in the village of Merissa. The scope of their free area extends to the far west of Macedonia, only two or three miles from the city of Grivena, which can be defended by the Greek government forces. There have been fierce battles in the Skra Mountains to the north for many days, but now there is no trace of the bandits. The Greek government's planes and artillery were also dispatched during the battle.</p>
<h3>Social Phenomenon Under High Pressure Living</h3>
<h3>Japanese University Students Compete to Be Western Musicians</h3>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 19th] Amid the postwar wave of inflation, the number of Japanese students seeking jobs to pay tuition and maintain their living expenses is increasing day by day. Those with skills do not have to worry about finding a way out. Currently, there are as many as 17 orchestras in Tokyo dance halls composed of university students, each earning between 16,000 and 20,000 yuan per month, which is quite enviable for civil servants and teachers whose monthly salaries are less than 1,000 yuan. According to Ohashi, a student in the music department of Keio University, since April of this year, the number of students organizing orchestras has gradually increased. He works at the Shirokiya dance hall from 1:00 to 4:30 every day, and at the Yaen dance hall from 5:30 to 9:00 in the afternoon, earning more than 20,000 yuan in busy months. However, it is still difficult to decide whether to completely abandon their studies and make this a career, or to continue their studies and make this a side job. Seriously considering the future is quite worrying.</p>

<h3>Woman Appointed Chair of Parliament: A First in Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Labour MP Mrs. Barton was elected today as one of the twelve chairpersons of the current session of the House of Commons. It is unprecedented in Britain for a woman to serve as chair of parliament. When the parliament holds meetings of the standing committees, Mrs. Barton will serve as chair. However, when the parliament discusses budget issues, the parliament will become a committee, and Mrs. Barton will serve as chair of the entire House of Commons meeting. The chairperson must be familiar with procedural law and know the names of all members of the House of Commons. Mrs. Barton's husband, Mr. Barton, is also a member of the House of Commons, and the two often sit together during meetings.</p>
<h3>China in the Eyes of the British</h3>
<p>—Sent by Zhu Zunxu, Our Newspaper's Correspondent in the United Kingdom</p>
<p>Although the news from China is unfavorable, the British public's opinion of China is not bad. The London Times publishes news about China every day, and publishes an editorial on China every month or two. Every year on Double Ten Day, the Times publishes an article analyzing the Chinese situation. The Times's position is fair, and it often criticizes the CCP's illegal and reckless behavior. Other London newspapers rarely publish Chinese news. Occasionally, they publish one or two articles, but 19 out of 20 are in the style of tabloids or evening newspapers. For example, what Chinese people eat, what they wear, and photos of young ladies wearing qipaos often appear in the gossip columns or miscellaneous sections of various newspapers. The News Chronicle used to publish many articles about China because of Geld, who promoted the CCP. However, he himself did not sympathize with the CCP. In fact, it was because he had disagreements with several spokespersons in Chongqing, and as a result, he developed a dislike for the entire Chinese government. When his dislike reached its extreme, he actually sided with the CCP. The Chronicle's view of China has gradually been corrected. Their political commentator, Mr. Bartley, is about to visit China. Mr. Bartley's world political vision has always been admired by the British. His view of the September 18th Incident is completely consistent with China's view. The Manchester Guardian, which has always been considered by the Chinese to sympathize with China, publishes very little news about China. Occasionally, there is an editorial, but its tone does not show "sympathy."</p>
<p>British magazines have mixed effects on China. The "Economist," the most influential weekly magazine, often has articles on China. Regarding China's inflation, it bluntly pointed out that the civil war is the root of all evils. This time, the leftist weekly magazine "New Statesman and Nation" has a tone about China that is somewhat similar to "Xinhua" and "Liberation." Its position is well known, just like the Daily Worker (organ of the British Communist Party), whose views are not taken seriously. The most successful point of the CCP's external propaganda is their so-called "peasant movement," which boasts of its rent reduction and other land reform policies in the border areas. Most British newspapers, including The Times, believe that the CCP has a solution to this urgent social problem.</p>
<p>The British are generally not concerned about the Hong Kong issue. Some people are very willing to return this island to China. Those who oppose it are still the "old China hands." What the people in Britain understand the least is: why do the Chinese in Hong Kong have such a deep dislike for the British? This suspicion is very natural, because the British in England do not know the life attitudes of the British in colonies, semi-colonies, and quasi-colonies - the arrogance of imperialists. These imperialists swagger and dominate abroad, but when they return home, their attitude changes and they are the same as ordinary, humorous British people.</p>
<p>The British do not understand China enough. Our country's foreign propaganda authorities should pay attention, but relying on propaganda alone is not enough. To make a nation understand us, introducing cultural life is one way; but clarifying the current domestic situation is the first thing. Everyone knows that China has a long history and a great culture, but if what is revealed from this great cultural background is all bad news, the big question mark in foreigners' minds will never be eliminated. (End)</p>
<h3>Although the "Rebellious Party" Trend in Britain Has Subsided, the Political Situation is Still Not Optimistic; The Opposition Accounts for More Than One-Third of the House; The Internal Split of the Labour Party Remains the Same</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] Although the House of Commons voted 335 to 0 last night to express confidence in the government's current foreign policy, 160 Labour MPs did not vote. Except for those who were ill or had other reasons, at least 100 Labour MPs made no indication when voting. The high proportion is worrying even if the government claims victory. Among the members who participated in the vote, there were 230 Labour members, 104 Conservative members, 7 Liberal members, and 12 members from various small parties. According to those who support the government, the vote of confidence is enough to show the world that British public opinion supports Foreign Secretary Bevin. However, critics say that the large number of abstaining members proves that the Labour Party's policy is still split in reality and has not been remedied as a result. There is a possibility that rebellious actions will occur again. The government should not ignore this crisis and say that everything is calm. The rebellious members explained the reasons for their abstention, saying that this vote cannot be interpreted as a general distrust of the government. For example, they fully agree with the government's domestic policies, and even have no objection to certain parts of its foreign policy. Therefore, the government's obtaining a majority of confidence in the House of Commons is due to the following two reasons: (1) In terms of domestic affairs, the Labour Party seems to be as united as ever; (2) In terms of foreign policy, the Conservative Party and loyal members of the Labour Party unanimously support the government.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Facsimile Telegraph Opens; Sending and Receiving Pictures and Photos Are Flawless; Rates Are Divided into 50,000 Yuan and 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Beijing-Shanghai facsimile telegraph service officially opened yesterday. The transmission of text, pictures, and photos is extremely clear. The facsimile telegraph machine at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau was installed and tested long ago. The Nanjing side also completed the testing yesterday. After the opening yesterday, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications sent a facsimile telegram to Mayor Wu, which read: "To Mayor Wu Guozhen of Shanghai, Honorable Brother: The Ministry is exerting all its efforts to improve the work of various transportation departments. Regarding telecommunications innovation, long-distance telephones have adopted ultra-shortwave wireless machines, and telegraphs have been tested with teletype machines, and special express telegrams have been opened to strive for rapid and accurate communication. Now, facsimile telegraphs are being tested in Beijing and Shanghai. On the occasion of the opening, I respectfully express my feelings and hope for your understanding. Your brother, Yu Dawei, November 20th."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu replied to Minister Yu: "To Minister Yu Dawei of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, Honorable Brother: I have received your telegram and learned that since you took over as Minister of Communications, you have been thinking hard and doing your best to improve the transportation industry, adopting new-style machines and testing facsimile telegraphs, so that public and private affairs can be reached in an instant, making the whole country one family and connecting east and west as one place. Promoting it to various places can be expected in the near future. I am deeply impressed and congratulate you. I respectfully reply. Your brother, Wu Guozhen, 20th Secret"</p>
<p>The receiving and sending location for facsimile telegraphs in this city is at the General Business Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, No. 70 Fuzhou Road. Before sending, you must first request special paper from that office, which is divided into two types: A and B. Type A costs 50,000 yuan per copy, and Type B costs 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Visit and Testing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 20th] After several months of efforts by telecommunications personnel in Beijing and Shanghai, the Beijing-Shanghai wireless facsimile has been successfully tested and officially opened. This morning, the reporter visited the receiving station of the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau, and Director Lei Dahua personally tested the Beijing-Shanghai telefacsimile and added explanations. First, a form was sent from Shanghai to Beijing, and the lines and handwriting were very clear. Nanjing also sent written documents to Shanghai. Paper that is 12 inches wide and 8 inches high can be transmitted in 8 minutes. According to him, because some parts have not yet been installed, the transmission of photos may not be very clear, but the transmission of other originals, regardless of whether they are written in steel pen or ink brush, or even blueprints, can be recognized word by word. If the situation is good, even lead characters of size 5 can be transmitted one by one, and the test results are shown, and some are not much different from ordinary printed matter.</p>
<p>The telefacsimile machines currently used by the Beijing and Shanghai Telecommunications Bureaus were produced by the American Western Union Company in 1942. A total of four machines were shipped to China, two of which are now in Nanjing and two in Shanghai. Soon, one will be shipped to Beiping. This type of machine is newer than the one currently used in Yu Kun, and can send and receive simultaneously, and has automatic equipment, unlike the former, which is troublesome and inconvenient. The order period was very early. Due to the war, it was stored in India for a long time. It was recently transferred from Chongqing to Beijing. Due to repeated relocation and the fact that each machine weighs three tons, it was damaged a lot when it was transported to Beijing, and it needed to be repaired, so the reason why it was delayed to open is because of this.</p>

<h3>Fire at Sea off Sheshan Island at Midnight; Hai Tian Vessel Almost Suffered Disaster; Careless Cargo Escort Caused Combustion of Straw Material on Board; After Rescue by Ship, Vessel Resumed Course to Qinhuangdao Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Hai Tian, a giant Liberty ship operated by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Shanghai-Qinhuangdao route, set sail from Shanghai at about 12 o'clock on the night of the 19th. When it arrived at the waters off Sheshan Island outside the Wusongkou, it suddenly caught fire. The customs patrol boat heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, and the fire was extinguished. The deck suffered slight damage. The vessel sailed to Qinhuangdao yesterday morning. Afterwards, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency obtained the truth from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as follows: The company received a fire report from the Hai Tian Vessel by radio the night before and immediately sent personnel to investigate. The cause of the fire was that the straw material that was easy to catch fire was loaded in the cargo, and the cargo escort was careless, causing the straw material to burn. Fortunately, the crew and customs patrol boat officers tried their best to rescue the ship and extinguish the fire. However, two cargo escorts were burned and were brought to Shanghai by the company by rescue ship yesterday morning and sent to the hospital for treatment. They are not in life-threatening danger. It is also learned that the Hai Tian Vessel is the company's largest Liberty ship, with a deadweight tonnage of more than 10,000 tons. This time, it was going to Qinhuangdao to load coal and bring it to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Landing Craft Run Aground Near Wanxian; Cargo Damaged by Moisture; Crew and Passengers Unharmed; French Ship Songdan Has Not Yet Sailed Out</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Chinese-character Hua-character landing craft are all sent to Shanghai and Chongqing because these landing craft have shallow draft and fast speed, so it is suitable to sail on the long Yangtze River. It is learned that the Hua-210 landing craft loaded goods from Chongqing on the 13th of this month and went downstream. At about 9 am the next morning, it ran aground on a reef near Shipo Sai near Wanjiang. The head cabin was pierced and the Yangtze River flooded in. The cargo was damaged by moisture, but fortunately the crew and passengers were unharmed. The craft immediately sent a telegram for help. The Yichang branch received the telegram and immediately sent a barge to the rescue. After receiving the report, the head office also sent the Hua-208 landing craft to tow it. According to the report from the craft, the river water has gradually receded in recent days. Yesterday, the head of the 210 craft was only a foot away from the water surface, and the back was slightly more than two feet away. Although the rice and other goods were taken out, the hull touched the reef and still could not float, so it was impossible to tow it for a while. Rescue efforts are continuing.</p>
<p>The French vessel Songdan, which came to Shanghai for the first time after the war, arrived in port on the 29th of last month. It was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to France on the 14th of this month. Because it was slightly repaired in Shanghai, it was rescheduled to set sail on the 16th. However, the crew suddenly made demands, which prevented it from leaving. Up until the 18th, it had not been resolved. The company telegraphed the Paris head office for instructions. No reply has been received yet, so the return date of the vessel is still not certain. As for passengers, in addition to French residents returning to France, some were Hong Kong passengers, who have already refunded their tickets and taken other vessels. The company's regular postal vessel André Le Bon set off from Marseille on the 15th of last month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Public Training Students' Grand Review</h3>

<h3>Disputes over the Hartung Estate: Nationality Issue to Become the Focus of Contention; Management Insists Hartung Was British; Twelve Iraqi Relatives Decide to Sue</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the Hartung estate, twelve close relatives from Iraq have recently sent representatives to Shanghai to relitigate the distribution of the estate. Details were reported in this newspaper on the 11th. According to the Hartung Estate Management Office, although Hartung was originally from Iraq, his naturalization as a British citizen is a well-known fact. The British Consulate in Shanghai issued him a passport at the time, which serves as strong evidence. However, the twelve close relatives insist that Hartung did not obtain British citizenship through legal procedures and can also provide evidence. Therefore, Hartung's nationality will be the focus of contention between the two parties in the estate case. The twelve are now considering the amount of the litigation target. Based on current estimates, the Hartung estate is worth over 50 billion legal currency. If this amount is used as the litigation target, the court fees will be as high as 650 million yuan. The majority of Hartung's estate consists of real estate, including over thirty properties, covering a total area of over 400 mu, as well as the Ci Shu and Hartung Buildings. Currently, the income from the real estate is far less than before. The total monthly income from Hartung's real estate is only over 40 million yuan. George Hartung, Luo Youlan, and over ten others each receive just over two million yuan per month. Therefore, it is widely believed that it is unwise for the twelve Iraqis to spend a large amount on litigation fees for a lawsuit with no certainty of success. However, the twelve Iraqis believe that their rights are at stake and must be fought for, and they have sufficient legal basis. They will file a lawsuit with the local court in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Suspicion of Abetting in the Zang Case: Lai Lingnai Indicted by the District Attorney's Office</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Lai Lingnai, a Spanish sailor suspected of abetting in the tragic death of Zang Daer's son, has been investigated by the District Attorney's Office, which has concluded its investigation and filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. The indictment is as follows: "Lai Lingnai, on September 22nd of this year, at around 10:00 PM, took a rickshaw from the Seamen's Club to the Huadu Dance Hall on Zhongzheng East Road. After getting out of the rickshaw and entering the dance hall, he failed to pay the fare. Zang Daer's son, the rickshaw puller, waited for ten minutes and saw him leave the dance hall and head east. He went forward to collect the fare. Lai Lingnai brushed him off. Zang Daer's son grabbed his arm, and other rickshaw pullers nearby also shouted for the money. Lai Lingnai, seeing this situation, suspected he was about to be beaten. Coincidentally, an American sailor passed by and he called for his help. The sailor, without asking what was happening, punched Zang Daer's son violently. Zang Daer's son fell to the ground, hitting his head and suffering a concussion, which led to his death. Zang Daer's son died from a concussion caused by injuries sustained during his lifetime, as confirmed by the prosecutor and forensic doctor who conducted the examination and filed a report. The defendant, Lai Lingnai, also admitted that he had a dispute over the fare and that the American sailor had punched the rickshaw puller Zang Daer's son, causing him to fall to the ground; however, he denied abetting the act. However, according to the rickshaw pullers Ren Xiaozhu and Liao Yuanshou, who were present at the scene, they both saw the defendant Lai Lingnai say a few words to the sailor before he punched the rickshaw puller. However, they did not understand his words. Considering the circumstances, the defendant Lai Lingnai is suspected of abetting another person in causing injury resulting in death, which violates Article 277, Paragraph 2, Section 1 and Article 219 of the Criminal Law. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Prosecutor Ji Su."</p>

The meeting began at 2:30 PM, attended by representatives from the US War Assets Administration, Lida International Trading Company, the US Consulate General, and the US Navy.

Both sides immediately agreed to this principle. As for which items would be exchanged, it would be decided by the US side after consulting with the Chinese side.</p>
<p>After the agreement was reached, Mayor Wu immediately held a press conference, reading a statement in English from President Song of the Executive Yuan regarding the matter, which stated: "Regarding the discovery of plasma among the large quantity of medical supplies sold by the US War Assets Administration to a Chinese trading company, the Chinese government had no knowledge of this matter until the news was revealed in the newspapers. The purchase by the Chinese merchant was completely legal; however, the government cannot allow the plasma donated by the American people to the Red Cross to be sold. I instructed Mayor Wu yesterday to seal up the plasma inventory and to facilitate an agreement between the US War Assets Administration and the purchasing trading company, so that a reasonable solution can be reached in accordance with normal procedures. I am now pleased to announce that the relevant parties have reached an agreement, and the buyer has agreed to return the plasma to the US Consulate General today through the Municipal Government.

<h3>Advising Stores to Conserve Electricity Voluntarily: Mayor Will Conduct On-Site Inspections</h3>

The suspect confessed that his name was Zhang Douchun, 30 years old, from Tianjin, residing at No. 16, Laoyemiao, Henan, Tianjin.

<h3>Fifteen Film and Drama Personalities to be Interrogated by High Court Today; Two Suspicious Films Reviewed Yesterday; Written Opinions Submitted on the Spot; Authorities Hope Those Reported Will Respect the Judiciary and Report When Summoned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Procuratorate of the High Court of this city will continue its hearing this morning at 9 a.m. to investigate film and drama personalities suspected of collaborating with the enemy. This second batch of those summoned includes Li Huan, Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, Mei Xi, Liu Zhonghao, Zhang Shichuan, Xu Xinfu, Zhou Shimu, Bian Ying, Shi Tingpan, Hu Jinkang, Jin Longzhang, Zhang Xiaohuan, Zhong Baoxuan, and Wu Zhongshan, a total of fifteen individuals. However, due to the failure to deliver some summons, it is feared that many may not be able to appear in court.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] During the occupation of this city, many personnel in the film and drama circles remained in Shanghai to work. After the victory, discussions regarding the issue of reporting film personnel who collaborated with the enemy were quite heated, but no results were seen. Until recently, a certain organization suddenly compiled a list of several dozen names and submitted it to the Procuratorate of the High Court for reporting. Currently, the Procuratorate is summoning and investigating them in batches. This move has made film personnel who remained in Shanghai in the past live in constant anxiety. The impact of this has almost brought the nascent film industry to a standstill. In order to clarify right and wrong, and to avoid wrongly accusing or letting off anyone, the Municipal Party Headquarters, in conjunction with relevant organizations and groups, screened two suspicious films, "Spring River's Lasting Regret" and "Ge Shi's Eternal Fame," at the Shanghai Guangda Theater yesterday morning for review. Those present included Fang Zhi, Xie Renzhao, Sun Dongcheng, and Xu Mingya from the Municipal Party Headquarters; Wang Guanqing from the Municipal Government; Luo Xuelian from the Central Propaganda Department; Li Ximou and Peng Zhenqiu from the Education Bureau; Chen Shenxiu and Xia Jingtao from the Social Affairs Bureau; Du Tongsun and Jiang Bin from the Film Censorship Office; Wu Huasheng from the Youth League; Liu Deming from the Friends of the Military Society; Zhu Renyi from China Electric; Liang Gengshun and Yang Shounian from the District Procuratorate; Zhang Che from the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee; and thirty to forty reporters from various newspapers. Qu Rong, the prosecutor from the High Court Procuratorate in charge of investigating film and drama personnel who collaborated with the enemy, also attended with his clerk. "Spring River's Lasting Regret" was screened first at 9 a.m., followed by a ten-minute break, and then "Ge Shi's Eternal Fame" was screened. It was already 1:30 p.m. when the screening was completed. Each participant in the review received a feedback form. The opinions on the two films, collected anonymously, were sealed on the spot and sent to the High Court Procuratorate as a reference for the investigation.</p>
<p>Reflections After Viewing</p>
<p>Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters stated after the viewing: "Ge Shi's Eternal Fame" was filmed before "Spring River's Lasting Regret." This is a historical film, and under the military rule of the Japanese at the time, being able to say 'Chinese people will not be slaves to a conquered nation' was truly remarkable. The Japanese were probably not satisfied with 'Ge Shi's Eternal Fame,' hence the existence of 'Spring River's Lasting Regret.' Moreover, the Japanese participated in it. What is noteworthy in that film is that when subtitles appeared, the Japanese were always listed first, followed by the Chinese. And the drama quietly arose from fabrication. As far as I know, the Japanese sonnō jōi movement has no connection with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Secretary-General Xie Renzhao of the Municipal Party Headquarters also said: "'Ge Shi's Eternal Fame' narrates Lin Zexu's ban on opium and resistance against the British. At that time, British imperialism certainly acted in this way, and there were indeed organizations such as the 'Anti-British Corps' in various places. Therefore, this film should be considered from two perspectives: first, in terms of narrating history, there is nothing to criticize; second, in terms of current international relations, since we are currently allies with Great Britain, it seems to present a problem. Regarding the conclusion of 'Spring River's Lasting Regret' that the Japanese sympathized with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, there seems to be no such record in history. The Japanese emphasized this to make the Chinese people feel favorable towards them."</p>
<p>Before the participants filled out their review opinions, Chairman Fang stated: "I hope everyone will criticize from an objective standpoint and that those who have been reported will report to the court according to the summons and respect the judiciary."</p>
<h3>Jiang Shangpei and Others Declared Not Guilty; Xie Guangming Sentenced to Two and a Half Years</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court yesterday announced the verdicts in two cases of suspected traitors: (1) Jiang Shangpei, former head of the Judicial Section of the New City Police Branch of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, Xie Guangming, deputy detective, Li Yongde, and Xu Shu, detective leader, were accused of illegally detaining people by abusing their power and infringing on their personal freedom. Jiang, now the head of the Judicial Section of the Old City Gate Branch of this city, denied illegally detaining merchants during the trial, stating that the reason he continued to serve in the puppet police station was to participate in intelligence work for the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, which was testified to by Yang Wenguang of the Fourth Division of the Shanghai Branch. He also participated in the anti-enemy police affairs led by Gan Jingxian, which can be proven by letters from Wu Tiecheng and Yu Hongjun to Qian Dajun. Wei Zhongda, who is currently employed by the Garrison Command, was also rescued from danger and provided with travel expenses by Jiang when he was harmed in the past, which was also testified to by Feng. Yesterday, Jiang, Li, and Xu were all declared not guilty. Xie Guangming was sentenced to two and a half years.</p>

<h3>New Office Address Approved for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai has been approved by the Executive Yuan to take over the former Japanese Consulate building at 106 Huangpu Road in this city due to the recent frequent international social events and the current office space being insufficient.

<h3>Gas, Ferry, and Small Train Prices Will be Adjusted Soon Zhao Zengjue Reported at the Municipal Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported on the process of adjusting public utility prices at the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon. He stated that the Public Utilities Bureau believes that public utility companies should be given reasonable profits and that their profits should be protected; otherwise, no one would be willing to invest in public utilities. This adjustment will not be made for those who can maintain their operations. For example, the Shanghai Telephone Company originally charged based on the number of calls, and the current increase in the number of calls has exceeded expectations, resulting in increased revenue and preventing losses. Therefore, no adjustment was made at all. For those who cannot maintain their operations, reasonable adjustments will be made based on their income and expenses. So far, those that have been approved include electricity, tap water, trams, and buses. Those under consideration include gas, ferries, the "Jidu," Shangnan, and Shangchuan small trains, which will be announced soon. This time, the bureau approved the prices of various companies, both to provide reasonable profits and to encourage them to increase capital and expand equipment to meet the needs of the people. For example, each power company was ordered to increase power generation, and the British and French tram companies were ordered to increase vehicles and handle the track connection from Jing'an Temple to Xujiahui Road. This week, the Public Transportation Company Preparatory Office was also ordered to increase the number of buses and pay road maintenance fees and license fees like other companies. In short, on the one hand, reasonable compensation will be given, and on the other hand, they will be ordered to improve service efficiency.</p>

<h3>Clearing Accumulated Coffins in the City; Health Bureau Sets Deadline for Removal from the City by Next Spring; Overdue Coffins Will be Cremated in Concentrated Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to improve the environmental sanitation of this city, the Health Bureau has decided to thoroughly clear the accumulated coffins in funeral homes, coffin storage places, and empty spaces in various districts of the city. The original deadline for the owners of coffins to remove them from the city was the end of the year, but it has now been extended to the end of March next year to allow the owners sufficient time. Coffins remaining in Shanghai after the deadline will be treated as ownerless and will be cremated in concentrated areas by district.</p>
<p>It is understood that more than 97,000 accumulated coffins in the city have been registered with the Health Bureau, and there are many others that have not been registered or are exposed in wasteland, estimated to total more than 100,000. Some of the ownerless coffins are mostly broken and decayed, with foul odors spreading everywhere. As a result, the district offices in each district have repeatedly requested the removal of the broken coffins. Now the Health Bureau has decided to handle the accumulated coffins in the entire city in a unified manner, adopting the most thorough method of cremation and implementing it within a time limit. In the future, the establishment of coffin storage places will be banned, and coffins placed in funeral homes will be limited to ten days. On the one hand, the government will establish a coffin transportation office to assist families in transporting coffins out of the urban area.</p>
<p>Since the decision on this measure, many owners of accumulated coffins have stated that they have no land and no money, making it difficult to relocate the coffins, and have called on the authorities to open more public cemeteries to allow for burial. However, according to the Health Bureau, the determination to clear the accumulated coffins has long been made, and the environmental sanitation of the majority cannot be affected by the difficulties of a few. As for opening more public cemeteries, it is not in line with the principle of promoting cremation and reducing public cemeteries in the new urban plan, and public cemeteries require land, estimated at 100 coffins per acre, then 100,000 coffins would require 1,000 acres. Moreover, there is an average of about 6,000 deaths per month. Not to mention that the municipal government lacks huge funds to purchase land, the value of land use is extremely uneconomical. At the same time, it is better for coffin owners to spend a sum of money to transport coffins to rural areas for burial once and for all than to store them in public houses and pay storage fees. Therefore, the Health Bureau hopes that coffin owners will comply with the deadline for removal.</p>
<h3>Abundant Inventory, Tight Credit; American Goods Expected to Fall, Not Rise; Generally Believed That the Trend of Smuggling is Difficult to Eradicate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the announcement of the import permit system, the market price of American goods in this city has not fluctuated, and there is no phenomenon of customers crowding the American goods market. Industry insiders told reporters: there is a lot of American goods inventory in this city, and credit is very tight. Prices will only fall and will not rise. Business people believe that the implementation of the import permit system will not raise the market price of American goods in the short term, but if the implementation is effective, it will have an impact in the long term. However, whether this is the case depends on whether smuggling can be cracked down on. Most people do not believe that smuggling can be completely eradicated, because smugglers have very large backgrounds and strengths, and the methods of smuggling are extremely varied. Under the current new control methods, smuggling may even become more rampant. Under the control of this psychology, the market price of American goods will not fluctuate.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Underground Money Shops; Rewarding Citizens for Reporting</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday received an order from the Ministry of Finance to strictly crack down on underground money shops in the city and reward citizens for reporting. The original order stated: "Since prices have risen sharply, the market interest rate has increased along with commercial profits, resulting in the emergence of so-called "underground money shops," which illegally engage in banking business and provide high-interest loans, exploiting and profiting, disrupting finance, and fueling speculation. Although they have been repeatedly investigated and dealt with in accordance with the penalty rules for privately established banks and money houses stipulated in the Ministry's management methods for banks, ordered to suspend business, and fined, these types of money shops are mostly temporary combinations attached to residences or shops. It is already not easy to investigate and deal with them, and even if they are discovered, after being dealt with, they can still be established in another place and continue to operate as before. Their actions have clearly violated criminal law and should be severely punished according to law in order to ban and eliminate them.</p>
<p>Article 344 of Chapter 33 of the Criminal Law on fraud, breach of trust, and usury stipulates: "Whoever takes advantage of another's urgency, recklessness, or inexperience to lend money or other goods and obtains excessive profits that are clearly disproportionate to the principal shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, detention, or a concurrent fine of not more than one thousand yuan." Article 345 stipulates, "Whoever habitually commits the crime in the preceding article shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years and may be concurrently fined not more than three thousand yuan." The reason why underground money shops can be rampant is that they take advantage of people's urgency, recklessness, and inexperience to achieve their goals of providing high-interest loans and illegally obtaining profits. In the future, all cases of this type that are discovered should still be reported to the Ministry and dealt with in accordance with the management methods for banks for the matter of unauthorized establishment of banks and money houses, and the part that violates criminal law should also send the criminals' credentials directly to the competent court for investigation according to law, in order to punish and warn. Please immediately transfer the order to all subordinates to strictly investigate these underground money shops and reward reporting in order to stop them, and should also issue a detailed announcement to all industries and businesses that if they need to finance funds, they should handle them at legally established banks and money houses according to proper procedures, or apply to local financial institutions (provincial and municipal bank branches) for small industrial loans in accordance with the regulations to avoid the exploitation of high-interest loans from illegal lenders (the following is omitted).</p>
<h3>Principals and Professors Serve as Councilors</h3>
<p>Council Asks the Judicial Yuan to Interpret Again</p>
<p>Regarding the matter that principals of public schools at all levels may not concurrently serve as provincial, county, or municipal councilors, the Ministry of Interior replied by telegram, "It has already been interpreted by the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry has no right to correct it." The details have been recorded in various newspapers. Citizens throughout the city are paying close attention, especially councilors who are in a situation where they cannot hold both positions and are studying the issue of choosing. Alternate councilors also hope to be announced soon so that they can fill vacancies. However, yesterday, reporters visited the authorities of the Council. According to reports, the Council is preparing to ask the Ministry of Interior again to submit it to the Judicial Yuan for further interpretation. The reasons are four: (1) No democratic country has regulations that principals and professors may not serve as councilors. Since our country is a democratic country, it should be allowed to participate in elections. (2) Members of the Political Council and representatives of the National Assembly in this country are also allowed to participate as principals and professors, and there are no prohibitions. The nature of councilors is the same as that of members of the Political Council and representatives of the National Assembly, and there should also be no regulations that they cannot hold both positions. (3) Although principals of public schools are appointed, there is no clear distinction between the levels of Jianren and Weiren. Therefore, they cannot be generally regarded as civil servants. (4) In today's national advocacy of education to build the country and respecting teachers and valuing education, it cannot be regarded as wrong to have educational personnel represent the people.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, the section in your newspaper on the 18th of this month about the Wenzhou workers being beaten at the Rihui Port wharf is inconsistent with the facts. The dispute on that day was originally caused by Wenzhou worker Jiang Xueqin leading a crowd to destroy the fifth and sixth branches of our association, beating up staff members Zhang Xingkun and Xu Zhengyang, as well as the family members of the executive director of the association, and destroying all public property and the portrait of the national father. Zhang Xingkun is still lying in Guangci Hospital. Therefore, in addition to the Social Affairs Bureau handling this matter, our association has also filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. We are afraid that the rumors are inaccurate. Please investigate and correct it. Shanghai Nanshi District Wharf Transportation Industry Workers Union.</p>
<h3>Social Services Advocate for the Lonely Elderly, Poor, and Sick; Willing Philanthropists Are Encouraged to Donate Generously</h3>
<p>Sixth Application: Nine out of Twelve Approved</p>
<p>On June 26, this column received a letter from Old Man Qingxia, which stated, "I am of meager virtue. My parents abandoned me when I was young. I am lonely and destitute, and I have tasted all kinds of hardships. I struggled to survive in society, worked hard, and avoided starvation... I have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for social services, so I dare to write a letter specifically to entrust you that if there are lonely elderly, poor, sick, and disabled civilians who are unable to make a living, I am willing to do my best to provide them with relief..." The next day, Old Man Qingxia handed over 500,000 Legal Tender and provided several suggestions. After being entrusted by this newspaper, it immediately formulated simple application rules and published them in this column on June 29. Subsequently, there were several applications every day. This column immediately followed the original intention of the old man and provided relief as appropriate. So far, for five months, five grants have been issued, benefiting more than 30 people. Later, thanks to the Jin Master of Jialin Loans, the colleagues of the Lianyizhang Firm, the colleagues of the Huamei Tobacco Factory, etc., who provided continuous assistance, the relief work became even larger. However, wailing spreads everywhere, and the severe winter is approaching. Those waiting to be fed are everywhere, and the fund has little left. We hope that enthusiastic people in society will work hard to donate generously so that the lonely elderly, poor, and sick can receive timely assistance, which is also a great good deed.</p>
<p>Twelve people applied for the sixth time, and nine have been approved. The difficult situations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lu Yanwen wrote: "My husband, Zhang Linfa, unfortunately died of illness on June 21. His funeral was simple, leaving behind three children. Life is difficult. We rely on pawned items to make a living. Thinking about the future, I cannot help but shudder..." A relief fund of 100,000 was approved.</p>
<p>(2) Jiang Fen wrote: "My husband passed away in August of this year. There is an elderly aunt of 60 above and young children below. The family is poor. Now that the severe winter is approaching, we will not be able to avoid the cold and hunger!" A relief fund of 100,000 yuan was approved.</p>
<p>(3) Liu Furong wrote: "I am a civilian, Liu Furong. My family is poor, and I am suffering from illness. Life is extremely difficult. Please provide relief." A relief fund of 50,000 yuan was approved.</p>
<p>(4) Yang Shuxian wrote: "My husband passed away four months ago. His funeral was simple. Now I only rely on peddling to make a living. It is difficult for a family of several people to get a full meal. Recently, I have been plagued by illness and cannot work. I hereby write a letter to ask for relief." A relief fund of 50,000 yuan was approved. (To be continued).</p>

<h3>Importer Registration Notice: Chen Changtong Explains in Detail to Various Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chen Changtong, Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Commission, convened a meeting with the responsible persons of various designated banks, both Chinese and foreign, at 1 p.m. yesterday on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. Mr. Chen gave a detailed explanation of the revised measures, implementing rules, and various application forms that had been issued. He also answered the questions raised by the various banks. The meeting adjourned around 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Most designated banks received the "Importer Registration Application Instructions" and four types of application forms issued by the Commission yesterday morning. However, due to printing issues, the number of copies issued was insufficient. Some banks have separately added their own printed copies according to the format. Once the printing is completed, applications can be accepted.</p>
<p>The "Importer Registration Application Instructions" list four items: (1) Importers should pay attention to Article 2 of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade: "Importers must apply for registration with the Provisional Import Control Commission according to the type of business they operate. The registration method will be determined separately by the Provisional Import Control Commission. Applicants for import permits are limited to registered importers." (2) According to the provisions of the preceding article, the Commission has announced the following: "Any merchant with a fixed business address who was operating before December 8, 1941, or who started operating after the above date, and is currently a recognized agent of a foreign exporter, or can provide records within one year to prove that he has the ability to engage in import trade, may apply for registration." (3) Importers who wish to apply for registration in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade shall, within two weeks from the date hereof, complete Form AR-1 "If importing goods listed in Schedule (2), Form AR-1(A) must also be completed simultaneously." and submit it to the Secretariat of the Commission. (4) The deadline for application registration for importers in ports other than Shanghai may be appropriately extended.</p>
<p>Four Types of Application Forms</p>
<p>As for the four types of application forms: 1. The importer registration application form is Form AR-1. 2. The past import classification table (limited to goods in Schedule (2)) is Form AR-1(A). 3. The import permit application form for goods ordered before November 17, 1946, is exclusively for applying for goods in Schedule (1), and is Form AL-P2(I). This application form must be jointly approved by the Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Commission and the Director of the Import Management Office. 4. The import permit application form for goods ordered before November 17, 1946, is for all goods other than those in Schedule (1), and is Form AL-P2(II). This application form must be approved by the Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>All of the above forms must be completed in quadruplicate, and they are all import permit applications for goods ordered before November 17 of this year. As for the import permit application forms for goods ordered after that date, they have not yet been printed and distributed.</p>
<h3>### Narrow Range of Trading in Gold, U.S. Dollar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The gold market was extremely stable yesterday, with a very narrow trading range. It opened at 2.498 million and once rose to 2.505 million. The demand was sluggish, and the buyers felt slightly indifferent, resulting in a slight decline. The low price fell to 2.485 million. The Central Bank then allocated 60 bars at a price of 2.485 million. After 10 o'clock, it was more stable. At noon, it struggled around 2.49 million. The mood was slightly better in the afternoon. It was reported that the Shanghai dollar in Hong Kong market had fallen, and next-day settlement rose to over 2.5 million. As a result, it rose 10,000 compared to the previous close. Decorative gold was 66,000. Sycee silver and silver dollars were both flat. The black market money was still flat, and the interest rate was from 12% to 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were even more abundant and buying interest was difficult to stimulate. The black market for U.S. dollars started at 4,550 yuan and then fell again. At noon, it retreated to between 4,420 yuan and 4,470 yuan, a drop of 100 yuan compared to the previous close. There was less supply and demand for Hong Kong currency. Telegraphic transfers were weak. As a result, it fell another 10 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate retreated from 915 yuan to 905 yuan with supply. The Indian exchange rate was offered at 1,100 yuan. The British exchange rate retreated from 14,800 yuan to 14,600 yuan. Only Hong Kong currency had some transactions. The rest were sluggish. The U.S. exchange rate remained stagnant.</p>
<h3>### Need for 50,000 Pieces, 60% Allocation, Cotton Yarn Supply and Demand Issues, Outports and Three Associations Request Assistance in Approval</h3>
<p>Since the allocation of yarn for the reproduction industry, the Yarn Control Committee has been supervising the allocation of yarn. Recently, the Camel Hair Weaving, Canvas Weaving, and Ribbon Weaving Associations have requested the Yarn Control Committee to approve the allocation uniformly. It is reported that it is expected to be approved and will be included in the complex allocation for joint processing. These three industries have about 300 member factories, most of which are small and medium-sized. The demand for yarn is still limited. As for the dyeing, knitting, underwear, towel, blanket, handmade cotton weaving, and handkerchief industries, the supplementary declarations for yarn allocation by member factories have been compiled and reported. The Yarn Control Committee will hold a meeting today to consider it. According to sources from the complex allocation committee, the total amount applied for in November was originally 40,013 pieces. The Yarn Control Committee decided to temporarily approve 60%, totaling slightly more than 24,000 pieces, which will be allocated and sold in four installments. Tomorrow will be the fourth installment. The quantity was originally insufficient. In addition, there was too much 10-count coarse yarn and not enough fine yarn in the previous allocations. A few factories abandoned their allocations due to the urgent payment deadline and insufficient funds. The complex allocation committee failed to reallocate the allocations to the households with shortages, resulting in a shortage of fine yarn for most. As a result, there were still a few returns of fine yarn. The general factories are increasingly feeling the shortage of yarn. Those who rely on stockpiled yarn to supplement their needs are becoming increasingly scarce. If there is no remedy for the supply of yarn, the reduction in work in the reproduction industry is inevitable. Mr. Pan Shih-hao, the person in charge of the complex allocation committee, had already advised the various industries not to add more machines and not to rush to restore old factories that had been shut down. He also stated that although there was an allocation of cotton yarn, there was no way to supply machines that were added or restored. Recently, various reproduction industries are investigating their member factories in batches to strictly crack down on false reports. According to the latest statistics reported to the Yarn Control Committee, the six reproduction industries have a total of 1,889 member factories, with 66,722 various looms, requiring a total of 42,316 pieces of various counts of cotton yarn, equivalent to 51,526 pieces of 20-count yarn. If calculated at 60%, it would be more than 30,000 pieces per month. However, the yarn factories feel that this is too much, while the various reproduction factories still feel that it is not enough. How to coordinate and adjust the overall situation is a concern for all parties involved. In addition, the cotton yarn reproduction industries in the inland have also been requesting allocations one after another. It is reported that the Yarn Control Committee has been paying close attention to this. According to sources, since the reorganization of the yarn allocation mechanism, the output of 10-count yarn from the yarn factories has increased significantly, while the reproduction industry in this city does not need it. The cost of 10-count yarn is lower and the profit is higher. However, it is also a pity to reduce the equipment that can spin 20-count yarn to spin 10-count yarn.</p>
<h3>### Review of Yarn and Cloth Transport to the South Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Yarn Control Committee has completed its review of the amount of yarn and cloth that various manufacturers have applied to transport to the South. Among them, except for 23 companies whose application amounts exceeded the limit, the committee sent letters to them requesting corrections. The rest have been issued transport permits one after another. In addition, the committee, considering that some yarn factories had previously also operated as distributors, has accepted applications for transport qualifications from today.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>Government bonds were sluggish again yesterday. A major player on the fifth floor sold off. Government Bond C opened at 1,450 yuan and gradually declined from 1,540 yuan, finally retreating to below 1,400 yuan at the close. As a result, it fell 90 yuan compared to the previous close. Bonds A, B, and E each fell 80 yuan. Bond D fell 100 yuan. The transaction volume was over 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Securities Industry</h3>
<p>Since the opening of deferred trading in the stock market in this city, the market has remained in a sluggish state due to the tight money supply and the heavy pressure of high-interest loans. Xie Tai Firm, Broker No. 51 of the Stock Exchange at 180 Nanjing Road, voluntarily suspended business yesterday morning. Several other firms are also about to founder.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Not Allowed for Exchange, Central Bank Reaffirms Previous Prohibition</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the revision of the Measures for Import and Export Trade, the Central Bank issued Circular No. 61, notifying various designated foreign exchange banks to slightly revise the original regulations and abolish the provisions of Circulars No. 1, 26, 42, 45, and 54 (except paragraph 6). Circular No. 45 stipulated that foreign currency could not be used to offset foreign exchange. Now that the circular has been abolished, whether foreign currency can be used to offset foreign exchange in the future has attracted much attention. It is learned that the Central Bank has issued Circular No. 62 stating that after the cancellation of Circular No. 45, the designated banks are still not allowed to accept foreign currency to offset foreign exchange for non-import purposes that have not been approved by the Central Bank in advance.</p>
<h3>Oil, Rice, and Grains All Showed Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of rice to the North and South rice markets continued. The registered amount of customers and goods was 16,000 piculs. Retail sales were active but not strong. The supply of southern japonica rice was abundant, and it retreated by more than 1,000 yuan. The lower and middle grades of northern japonica rice were also weak by 300 to 500 yuan. Indica rice remained stable due to the firm production price. White silver retreated by 1,000 yuan, while gray silver was raised several times. The flour mills continued to supply, but sentiment was weak. Miscellaneous brands fell another 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat remained flat. The arrival of soybeans increased today. Retail sales in this street were still good. The high price was stagnant. Sesame was scarce and firm. There were no large-scale purchases of raw peanuts from Nanyang in this street. There were few transactions. The market fell again by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cake purchases from Fujian and Shantou were not strong, retreating by 100 to 200 yuan. The oil market traded as usual today. Soybean oil sales were very strong, retreating by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw oil was firm.</p>
<h3>### Hankou Gang and Others Sold off in Large Quantities, Soybean Oil Actually Fell into the Negotiated Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The new negotiated price for edible oil was implemented yesterday. However, the price of oil continued to fall because the Hankou Gang sold off 1,000 to 2,000 dan of soybean oil, and merchants also frequently sold off. Therefore, the market price fell below the new negotiated price limit. The average price of edible oil was 1,000 to 2,000 yuan lower than the negotiated price. Soybean oil was 131,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil was 127,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Opening Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Cloth Factories Having Difficulty Obtaining Yarn Prefer to Exchange Yarn for Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Report] There were still few transactions in the yarn market yesterday. Initially, Yong'an Yarn Factory planned to sell 100 pieces of 20-count Jincheng yarn at the official price, and Shenxin Yarn Factory also planned to open 100 pieces of yarn, limited to old customers who had previously traded with them. However, objections were raised by people in the industry, who believed that this was not a fair way. The two factories temporarily did not open up as a result. The external transactions were subject to the regulations of the Standing Bureau and did not open for business. A general customer help for those who are eager to handle goods, there is a great deal of money to buy no goods.</p>
<p>The cloth market is currently stable after Mayor Wu personally instructed the cloth industry representatives to pay attention to group prices. However, due to the small inventory, the price rises as soon as customers purchase it. General weaving factories have great difficulty obtaining yarn. They are unwilling to open sales in the market and often prefer to exchange yarn for cloth so that the raw materials will not be depleted. This kind of barter is really a last resort. Dyed cloth is also extremely tight due to the price of dyestuffs, so No. 190 Shilin has risen by another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan yesterday. Longtou fine cloth is currently priced at 92,000 yuan, Lanji fine cloth is priced at 90,000 yuan, and Sijunzi white printed poplin is currently priced at 98,000 yuan. Shilin cloth is priced at 145,000 to 146,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Mostly Settling Transactions, Hua Shares Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for delivery of Hua shares. People's hearts were doubly troubled. Both buyers and sellers were mostly settling transactions. The market was extremely fluctuating, initially high and then low. At the opening in the morning, the prices of the shares were low. After Nos. 229 and 151 bought in, the buying intention on the surface was very strong, and the chips were surprisingly dry. The market gradually rose. After 10:45, it started to turn from firm to flat. The source of supply outside the market was gradually reported. Nos. 89, 4, and 151 sold. Even No. 111's efforts to buy Di Yong Yarn could not support it. Only around 11:30, Nos. 87 and 198 and others came in. After selling, No. 229 of Xian Yong Yarn re-entered. After the low, it was still easy to pull up. In the end, the surface and floating multiples competed to sell. The Xian Meiya fell miserably and retreated to a new low price. The Xian delivery price of Xinhe Yong Yarn occasionally showed an inverted phenomenon. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xian Yong Yarn, Xinhe, and Xinguang all saw slight declines, while Meiya and Jingfu each fell by half a percent.

There were no transactions for the delivery of Yonggong. The rest all fell slightly. In the afternoon, only cash transactions appeared. People's hearts were unstable. No. 229 sold and then entered again. After opening, the market once fell step by step. After Yong Yarn saw a low price of 562 yuan, retail investors seized the opportunity to maintain it. The surface helper then entered again. The chips were dry, and the market gradually increased. Nos. 38 and 176 strongly sold at high prices, but the buying was very strong, but it was only a slight struggle.

<h3>White Coal Stops Falling and Turns Stable</h3>
<p>In the coal market, the low price of white coal screen pieces has slightly increased, and the market situation is gradually stabilizing. Previously, due to the impending payment period for small-scale peers, those who were unable to purchase could only sell at low prices, and the market price once retreated. Today, because the payment period has arrived, the outflow of this batch of coal is scarce, and the market price has returned to a firm and quiet state. Since the source of Hongji chips for coal balls has been lacking and the allocation of goods from various factories has been reduced, the supply has been insufficient. Various coal shops are suffering from coping with it. The normal combustible coal balls have risen to 10,000 yuan per picul at the door.</p>
<h3>China Sugar and White Sugar Fall</h3>

<h3>American Cotton Rallies and Falls</h3>

<h3>Nanyang Market, Britain and the United States Have Already Taken the Lead, National Goods are Too Expensive and Transportation is Difficult</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A related person told the reporter: At present, the trade between our country and various parts of Nanyang is very sluggish. In the past, before foreign goods arrived in the Nanyang region, the temporary need was very urgent, and the standard requirements for goods were not high. Therefore, a considerable amount of our country's yarn and some daily necessities were transported to the South. But today, the situation is completely different. British and American goods have been imported into Nanyang in large quantities, and our country's yarn supply is insufficient. The high cost of goods, even if transported to Nanyang, is difficult to open up sales. Transportation is also a difficult problem. Currently, only the ships of the Java Shipping Company are sailing to Nanyang. Several weeks ago, a Nanyang merchant came to Shanghai to handle goods, but he still returned empty-handed, because the high prices in the Shanghai area made him afraid to start. As for the import of Nanyang goods, the number is also very small. Occasionally, some coconut oil and rubber are transported out, but the number is not large. Compatriots hope for national goods very much, but the motherland is really unable to satisfy their ardent hopes. Looking forward to Nanyang trade, it is difficult to be optimistic at present.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Education Bureau Begins Preparations for Students to Participate in Military Training</h3>
<p>National Training Results Not Satisfactory</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense recently issued an order to all high school and above students nationwide to receive military training this year. Student families in this city expressed great concern. The reporter specially visited Mr. Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, and was informed that the military training issue for high school and above students this year was only seen in the newspapers. The bureau has not yet received instructions from the Ministry of National Defense. However, in order to prepare all students in the city to receive military training, the bureau sent personnel to various schools to investigate the current situation of "National Training." The results were not satisfactory. The reason is that the instructors dispatched by the Ministry of National Defense to various schools to teach "National Training" mostly lack combat experience. Therefore, once military training is implemented, the actual ability of the instructors seems to be weak. Therefore, the bureau has prepared a document to submit to the Ministry of Education and forwarded to the Ministry of National Defense, requiring that teachers dispatched to various schools to teach military training in the future must have the following two qualifications: (1) Must have actual combat experience. (2) Must be graduates of the Central Army University. In this way, both knowledge and experience will be rich, and the foundation for students to receive military training can be laid.</p>

<h3>"Collapse Wind" Strikes Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 10th</p>
<p>After the victory, the complex and intricate nature of the takeover institutions caused unrest in domestic industry and commerce. Unexpectedly, domestic wars arose one after another, pushing this already fragile industry and commerce into a difficult predicament. It has now reached its most dangerous eve. In major cities across the country, the sound of merchant houses and firms collapsing is frightening and chilling. This is clearly bordering on the verge of industrial and commercial collapse. If no measures are taken to provide relief, then it will undoubtedly wither and die!</p>
<p>Collapse Wind Spreads Across All Industries</p>
<p>Hangzhou was originally a city that exported special products, such as silk, tea, and tung oil. In previous years, it not only won wealth for Zhejiang Province through the export of these special products, but also won back considerable honor in the international market. However, the export of special products after the war has become an extremely serious problem. Foreign markets already have substitutes or identical finished products. Domestic markets are plagued by chaos everywhere, coupled with currency devaluation, high costs, dumping of foreign goods, heavy profiteering, and onerous taxes, causing special products to encounter serious obstacles everywhere. As a result, they went from struggling to maintain to being unable to maintain. The number of merchant houses and firms that went from being unable to maintain to collapsing and being destroyed is indeed a considerable figure. This collapse wind has spread to every industry, with tea firms being the most affected. In thirty-six days, twenty-eight have already declared closure. Although there are no accurate statistics on other closed shops for the time being, there were twenty-four business units that applied to the city government for record and closure procedures in October, such as five in the cloth industry, five in the entertainment industry, one in the grain industry, one in the electrical machinery and silk weaving industry, two in the laundry and dyeing industry, one in the silk business, eight in the coarse paper industry, one in the sundry goods business, one in the preserved meat business, one in the native tobacco business, one in the timber rafting business, and one in the cotton weaving business. If we use monetary figures to illustrate its severity, it will be over 200,000,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Reasons for Tea Firm Closures</p>
<p>According to the operators, the reason for the tea firm closures is the government's levy of tea commodity tax. In its heyday, Zhejiang tea was originally subject to a special product tax levied by the province. Later, the provincial government abolished the special product tax in an attempt to revive the tea industry. Not long after, the Commodity Tax Bureau levied commodity tax again. When tea leaves were facing extreme difficulties with no way to export, they could not withstand the collection of this kind of tax, so they closed down one after another. Another reason is the exploitation of high-interest loans. Tea firm owners used funds obtained from high-interest loans to operate the tea business, which did not yield very high profits, and naturally felt somewhat strained. Conversely, if they used the funds for running a tea firm to make high-interest loans, they could worry much less. Therefore, the tea industry fears that it will not be able to restore its inherent prosperity for a while. The result of these tea firm closures will be that tea farmers will have fewer outlets for their tea leaves, and tea farmers will suffer extra blows and hardships. On the other hand, this nearly 100,000,000,000 yuan in funds will turn into floating capital, speculating and causing trouble in society.</p>
<p>In addition to the severe exploitation of high-interest loans and the two-pronged attack of the enticing allure of speculation causing closures of stores, another reason for the closure of many other firms is the decline in social purchasing power. The income of civil servants for a month is not enough to eat and dress warmly, let alone have the surplus to buy new things. The countryside is bankrupt, factories are precarious, and fellow farmers and workers also lack the ability to purchase. Moreover, due to the temptation of high-interest loans, even the remaining purchasing power that has been forgotten and left behind is transformed into floating capital, joining the ranks of high-interest loan businesses. Some of those who have obtained wealth from high-interest loans want to accumulate more and more, while others, although they buy some things, are ultimately a small minority. Therefore, in the market of Hangzhou City, many shops are seen every day decorating with lanterns and colored streamers, blowing and beating instruments, hanging large bargain flags with red silk and gold lettering, holding great sales from spring to summer, and then to autumn and winter throughout the year, but business is still far less lively than usual in previous years. If these great sales still do not make money, then the only option is to close down. The number of shops closing down in this way will increase more and more, the floating capital in society will accumulate more and more, and the production units will collapse more and more. Meanwhile, foreign goods are coming in continuously, both cheap and ingenious. It is unthinkable that our Chinese products can be sold abroad again, and because of the cheap and fine quality of foreign goods and the unrest in the domestic situation, it is also unthinkable that they can be sold to various parts of our country.</p>
<p>New Aspirations of the Business Community</p>
<p>Some say that to rescue China's current industry and commerce, only government banks can provide large amounts of low-interest loans. This goal is precisely the beautiful aspiration that the various business communities in Hangzhou are unanimously pursuing. However, if the government provides loans, the bright future after obtaining the loans is highly questionable. For example, when purchasing silkworm cocoons at high prices, the government sets a considerable price, but cocoon merchants still clamor that it is not high enough, while in reality, the purchase price is often less than the government-set price. The reason for this is because the bank has loans, and the government lends to the cocoon merchants according to the set price. The cocoon merchants use a small amount of money to buy cocoons, and use the other money for other purposes. - These purposes are presumably for things like high-interest lending. Therefore, in order to ensure that these loans are indeed used in the industrial and commercial sectors, and that they are indeed for seeking industrial and commercial revival, there must be strict investigation, meticulous lending, and after lending, there must also be thorough assessment. Some people say, if these funds are lent out, won't inflation increase further and the currency depreciate further? I believe that as long as these many loans are directly lent to production units, and truly make one yuan produce the effect of one yuan, then it can still revive a portion of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Grand Old Slogans</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to propose a grand old slogan that has been ineffective for decades, which is "Chinese people should use Chinese goods." First, we must cultivate a national mentality of loving domestic goods. I remember that before the war, in the Hongkou area of Shanghai, there was a Japanese child who wanted to buy a box of cigarette lighters. He went to a Chinese shop, and the shop assistant told him: "We have Chinese lighters, which are cheaper and better than Japanese ones. Why don't you buy a box to try!" But the child shook his head and left. He still went to a Japanese shop to buy a Japanese lighter to take back. This story can alert us, can awaken us. Our industry and commerce are so fragile today, and only by doing this, only by doing this, can we find a solution.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Export of Special Products</p>
<p>Hangzhou is a city for transporting and selling special products, and Zhejiang is a key area for agricultural special products. If these many special products cannot be transported and sold abroad for a while, then everyone will collapse. Therefore, the government should invest heavily and reluctantly encourage the export of special products, even at a loss. For example, the tea firms and shops have closed down as many as twenty-eight due to the increase in commodity tax, which is worth the government's consideration.</p>
<p>Need for Expert Research</p>
<p>We may also invite experts to conduct detailed research on these many special products and invent various other daily necessities, just like Germany during the war, which was able to turn [illegible] into bread substitutes, and the United States after the war, which was able to make socks, leather shoes, leather bags, etc. from plastic (Plaztic), which can be said to be the result of research.</p>
<p>The collapse wind of shops and firms has fiercely struck Hangzhou, a city for transporting and selling special products. We don't know when this strange wind will stop. We can only automatically strengthen and consolidate our houses, so as not to have this strange wind blow all our people and things into the ocean, and be swallowed by the waves.</p>
<h3>The Re-education of Over Two Million Taiwanese Compatriots - Civic Training in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— He Minxian</p>
<p>Taiwan Air Mail, 12th</p>
<p>On this National Day of historically great significance, on the treasure island of Taiwan, is the first day that 2,394,685 male and female youth citizens successively began to receive "re-education". It has now been closed for training for more than a month. Regarding the unprecedented training work of this large-scale and universal nature held in the province, it can be regarded as unprecedented and truly an initiative. According to the relevant authorities, the training motivation, goals, and the content and process of the work carried out are as follows:</p>
<p>Understanding the Actual Situation of the Country</p>
<p>The motivation for the Taiwan Provincial Government to re-educate these two million citizens is based on the fact that Taiwan Province was under Japanese rule for fifty-one years in the long years of shackles. Japan has consistently implemented a policy of isolation, gradually alienating compatriots in this province from the motherland. Now that the province has been restored for almost a year, but none of us can deny the necessity for compatriots in this province to have a deep understanding of everything about the motherland. The greatest purpose of this event is to exercise civil rights and hope to build a sound foundation for our local autonomy. Then, following the instructions of Chief Executive Chen, adult training should be held quickly, using a simple and clear method to tell them about the history, geography, and customs of the country, so that they can understand the actual situation of the country. Therefore, the "Taiwan Provincial Civic Training Committee" was organized to be responsible for hosting and promoting everything. Because the educational level and law-abiding habits of compatriots in this province are higher than any other province in the mainland, as long as they have a deep understanding of everything about the motherland in the future, they will definitely make unparalleled contributions to the country and the nation!</p>
<p>Six Training Objectives</p>
<p>Its training objectives are six: (1) Strengthen the understanding of the Chinese nation, (2) Deeply understand the current situation of our country, (3) Actively promote the essence of the Three Principles of the People, (4) Fully develop the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, (5) Comprehensively and universally promote government decrees, (6) Train popular teaching.</p>
<p>Three Basic Organizational Layers</p>
<p>The basic organization for promoting this training work is divided into three layers of agencies: provincial, county (city), and township (town). Such as (1) At the provincial level: organize a civic training committee, with the civil affairs office, education office, propaganda committee, and other relevant personnel as members, to preside over civic training matters throughout the province, and with Director Zhou Yi'e of the civil affairs office as the chairman; (2) At the county and city levels: also establish a committee with the county mayor as the chairman; (3) At the district and township (town) levels: assign the district chief and township chief as supervisors.</p>
<p>Two Training Methods</p>
<p>As for the training methods, according to their nature, they are divided into classroom-style training, that is, setting up "civic training lecture halls," and the general extensive training, that is, "social civic training." (A) Civic training lecture halls - using local schools, churches, Sun Yat-sen halls, and other public places in each village and neighborhood as the hall site. (If there is a lack of teachers, one lecture hall may be set up jointly by two to three villages and neighborhoods. In the first phase, each household designates one male or female person aged 20 to 30 to participate. If the venue permits and there is no difficulty in recruiting teachers, two classes for men and women can be set up separately. The training period for each phase is set for one month, two hours each day, with the time arranged so as not to hinder their work. (B) Social civic training - using local cinemas and theaters as lecture halls for implementing social civic training, broadcasting slides and lectures for 30 minutes before each screening, or using other methods that arouse their interest. At the same time, broadcasting civic training courses on the radio for 30 minutes every day.</p>
<p>Eight Training Subjects</p>
<p>The subjects of the civic training lecture hall are divided into two major departments: political and Sinicization. The former includes the promotion of government decrees and the application of the four powers, while the latter includes the understanding of history and geography and the inculcation of party doctrine. The detailed content includes twelve items: (1) Mandarin, (2) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, (3) President's speeches, (4) New Life Movement, (5) History and geography, (6) Essentials of local autonomy, (7) Overview of the province's administration, (8) Current affairs explanation, (9) Laws and regulations explanation, (10) Physical education, (11) Music, (12) Others. Judging from the content of the above-mentioned teaching materials, they are the minimum that a citizen must understand. If everyone can receive good training, they will definitely gain a lot when the term expires. Currently, the association has compiled and printed 100,000 copies of this textbook, which are responsible for distributing them to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Teachers Recruited Locally</p>
<p>Due to the limited funding and the difficulty of recruiting teachers and talents, the teachers of each subject in the civic training lecture hall are all recruited locally, and the committee in each county and city hires local elementary and secondary school teachers, administrative and autonomous personnel, party and state workers, government decree propaganda personnel, local people, and others who have a basic understanding of the training subjects. As for the broadcasters or lecturers of social civic training, they are hired by the provincial, county, and city civic training committees, hiring those who are knowledgeable and have teaching experience. The above-mentioned personnel are all honorary positions, and only provide spiritual encouragement to assist in the development of public messaging work.</p>
<p>Strict Assessment of Merit and Demerit</p>
<p>In order to understand the promotion situation of each county and city this time, prepare a reference for the second phase of the plan to be launched next year, and to ensure that this training does not waste time, manpower, and material resources, and can achieve satisfactory results, the special commissioner dispatched inspectors to 17 counties and cities throughout the province in separate areas. It is expected that after this inspection, many valuable opinions will be contributed, and it will enable us to better understand the actual truth of this training work. As for the rewards and punishments, they are divided into three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) List the civic training work as one of the annual assessments of the county mayors and mayors of each county and city, and the district chiefs and township chiefs who are responsible for presiding over the work.</p>
<p>(2) If a trainee is absent without reason, violates the rules of the lecture hall, or engages in other improper conduct, a warning will be given according to the severity of the circumstances, or the names of those who are absent will be posted, and they will be punished with labor service (work service) for one to two days (and even after receiving the aforementioned punishment, they must still be forcibly ordered to attend the training.) If the circumstances are serious, they may be handed over to the local police authorities for severe punishment in accordance with the rules for punishing police offenders. As for trainees with excellent character, who abide by the rules, and who have excellent test results, they will also be given commendations.</p>
<p>(3) If a part-time teacher in charge of the lecture hall serves conscientiously, teaches diligently, and has excellent results, they will be given a commendation and recorded a merit, and will be listed as one of the annual assessments of the original service unit.</p>
<p>Progress Ascends Sequentially</p>
<p>The civic training subjects are as mentioned above. As for the content and materials, they are completely aimed at citizens with the level of graduation from national schools, and the writing examples are as simple as possible. At the same time, teachers of each subject can also supplement them at any time, and its progress is sequential. Taking the subject of "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings" as an example, it is listed in the first week, and the arrangement for the six days is as follows: on the first day, first talk about the biography of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; on the second, third, fourth, and fifth days, continue to buy about the nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood in the Three Principles of the People; on the fifth day, talk specifically about the psychological construction in the "Strategy of National Reconstruction"; on the sixth day, continue to talk about the political construction of the "Industrial Plan" and "National Construction Outline." The other seven weeks are used for [illegible] utterances, New Life Movement, and local autonomy, and each subject is also distributed equally in the same way as above, in an orderly manner, so that trainees can get a complete concept of each issue.</p>
<p>Hope to Work Together</p>
<p>The civic training held in Taiwan Province this time is very important to the psychological construction of compatriots throughout the province. If we want to build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People, we must pay more attention to their psychological construction. However, this arduous task requires the joint efforts of the government and the people. Citizens are the masters of the country. If they lack even the minimum knowledge and ability that a citizen should have, then it will greatly reduce the power to build the country. Here, I sincerely hope that people of insight from every corner of Taiwan will come together to assist the local government in completing the government's great plan to implement civic training, and that everyone will embrace the spirit of "those who know first awaken those who know later" and "those who are aware first awaken those who are aware later," and give them practical help at all times to achieve brilliant results.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Xinjiang (Part Four)</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>If Chairman Zhang Zhizhong wishes to regain the confidence of the indigenous people of Xinjiang Province, he must overcome two crucial difficulties. First, he must obtain economic assistance from Nanjing to alleviate Xinjiang's declining economic situation, with the construction of roads and improvement of transportation being the most pressing concern. Second, he must eliminate the widespread communist propaganda. Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union is extraordinarily concerned about Xinjiang's political future.</p>
<p>To restore prosperity and stability to Xinjiang, General Zhang Zhizhong has specially hired ten of China's most progressive engineers to go to Dihua to plan a development scheme for Dihua on Zhang's behalf.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang urgently needs a team of well-trained and physically strong soldiers who can withstand the harsh climate of the mountains and deserts, to replace the poorly trained recruits currently stationed at key locations in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>General Medical Conditions</p>
<p>Due to a lack of medicine, doctors, and hospitals in Xinjiang Province, public health conditions are extremely poor. Provincial officials have stated that unless relief is provided before the height of winter, the two epidemic diseases of typhus and cholera will likely cause disaster for the indigenous Hui people. In reality, these two Asian epidemics are currently relatively mild; the diseases with the highest and increasing mortality rates in Xinjiang are smallpox, dysentery, malaria, syphilis, and typhoid fever.</p>
<p>According to estimates by health authorities, the infant mortality rate in Xinjiang Province exceeds 70%, mostly due to smallpox and dysentery.</p>
<p>A severe typhus epidemic is spreading in the mountainous pastoral areas surrounding Dihua. Unless serum and preventive agents such as DDT are rushed from eastern China, the epidemic is feared to soon spread to Dihua.</p>
<p>Dihua, with a population of 100,000, has only two hospitals: one general hospital with 400 beds and one mental hospital with 40 beds. Both are very poorly equipped. The entire Xinjiang Province has a total of ten hospitals with 1,100 beds. The provincial population is estimated by the Mountain State government to be 4 million, while the Hui people themselves claim it is over 7 million. However, this vast population receives very little medical assistance.</p>
<p>According to health authorities, only three tons of medicine have been shipped to Xinjiang Province from eastern China since 1943. It is said that UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) allocated medicine to Xinjiang Province two years ago, but due to a lack of transportation, this medicine is still held up in Kunming, Chongqing, and Nanjing.</p>
<p>Xinjiang urgently pleads with UNRRA and CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) to rush serum, sulfur preparations, DDT, and other medicines to rescue the critical public health situation there. A single plane can carry enough medicine to avert the crisis. This gives UNRRA and CNRRA an opportunity to prove the noble value of their relief work.</p>
<p>Due to the political situation created by the successful Hui rebellion, UNRRA or CNRRA medicine is best delivered directly to Hui leaders, without accompaniment by American or Chinese officials; otherwise, the Hui people will refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>The Manas River is the military boundary separating China from the northwestern areas controlled by the rebels. Here, it symbolizes the daunting task that China undertakes in political and economic construction. The "Great Western Bridge" over the Manas River, before it was destroyed by floods this June, was the only road bridge connecting the inland areas of deserts and mountains with the fertile northwestern border of the new province. Now, only two empty, three-earthen-pillar bridge abutments remain, facing each other on the banks of the Manas River. According to a government spokesperson, the authorities are not yet prepared to rebuild the bridge. If this bridge remains unbuilt, it is difficult to imagine restoring friendly relations between the National Government in Dihua and the rebel government in Yining. Telegraph and telephone lines between Dihua and Yining have been cut off since the Hui rebellion from September 19, 1944, to January 19, 1946, and have not been reconnected.</p>
<p>During this summer's low tide, some cargo trucks carrying Soviet cloth, candy, and cigarettes were able to wade across the Manas River to Dihua. However, the winter storms have arrived, foreshadowing that this limited transportation will also be cut off. Therefore, until next summer, the only transportation line between China and Yining will depend on the irregular flights of Soviet airline transport planes. China is striving to restore the territorial integrity of its largest and most remote province, and it seems that even geography is working against China.</p>
<p>If General Zhang Zhizhong, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, wishes to regain the confidence of the four million Hui people of Xinjiang, he must restore commerce in the heart of Xinjiang. In fact, the majority of Xinjiang's exportable products grow in the fertile three northwestern regions, namely Yili, Tarbahatai, and Altai.</p>
<p>Dihua, historically the administrative center of Xinjiang, is now striving to maintain its position as a trading post for camel caravans from northern and southern Xinjiang. Currently, apart from cosmetics, cigarettes, tea, and a small amount of cloth, almost no goods are shipped from mainland China. Therefore, Dihua must obtain various supplies from the rebel government in Yining. However, Dihua has nothing that Yining needs except tea, cosmetics, and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Dihua urgently needs goods produced in Yining, such as grains, beef, mutton, animal hides, rice, fruit, gasoline, and gold. However, even if the Manas River Bridge is rebuilt and these commodities can be transported, Dihua ultimately cannot compete with Kazakhstan, because the latter has excellent roads, abundant consumer goods, and machinery, which are needed by the Hui people of the northwestern region but cannot be supplied by the Chinese authorities. What the entire Xinjiang Province urgently needs are textile factories to weave local cotton and wool into cloth.</p>
<p>When Sheng Shicai ousted Soviet industries in 1942, he used US$4.2 million to purchase a modern aircraft manufacturing plant from the Soviet Union, intending to convert it into a textile factory. Sheng also used US$500,000 to purchase American textile machinery from a company in Shanghai, but this machinery has not yet been delivered. As a result, millions of indigenous people and thousands of Chinese soldiers in the new province are left without warm clothing, preparing to endure another harsh winter. There is a surplus of cloth in neighboring Soviet territory, but it cannot be obtained for the following two reasons:</p>
<p>First, the Yining government fears opposing the transportation of this cloth to Dihua.</p>
<p>Second, since Sheng Shicai closed the western gate of the new province, the Soviet Union has not concluded any commercial treaty with the new province.</p>
<p>Unless cloth is rushed here from the mainland within a month, traversing 2,000 miles of desert roads, millions of people and thousands of Chinese troops in the new province will be in danger of freezing and starvation.</p>
<p>National Defense Highway</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of defending its Central Asian frontier, China has allocated 30 billion Legal Tender (Chinese currency) to build a military highway network to connect the vast remote province of Xinjiang with mainland China. With no preparations currently being made to repair the war-torn roads in the interior provinces, this costly project is worthy of attention. This new national defense highway trunk line runs from Lanzhou in northern Gansu, crosses the border of Qinghai, and reaches Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province, for a total length of one thousand seven hundred li. The section from Lanzhou to Duolan, about three hundred and fifty li, has been completed. From Duolan, it must cross the branches of the Kunlun Mountains, pass through the desolate marshes of the Qaidam Basin, then cross the snow-covered Altyn Tagh Mountains, penetrate the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert, and meet the ancient caravan route in Qakilik. It crosses the desert to Kucha, where it quickly ascends the mountain road across the Tianshan Mountains and goes straight to Dihua. The necessity of this arduous undertaking lies in the following facts: Currently, the only connection between Xinjiang and mainland China is the ancient Silk Road from Lanzhou, passing through the Xingxing Gorge mountain pass on the eastern side into Xinjiang Province, taking the route through Hami. This medieval road has been frequently attacked by bandits in recent months, posing a dangerous risk from guerrilla bandits who often come and go in the mountains along the Outer Mongolian border. The main purpose of this Lanzhou-Dihua highway is to prevent the isolation of Dihua, the key western fortress of China. Its strategic importance is no less than that of the motor road that the Soviet Union is now completing outside the western border of Xinjiang. This road is located between Stalinabad and Khorog, passing through plateaus higher than 13,000 feet in the Pamir Mountains. However, the difference is that the Soviet Union is using modern road-building machinery, while China must build the road manually, in the harsh winter. (The End)</p>

<h3>Reprinting and Translation</h3>
<p>— Adhering to Tradition First</p>
<p>According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang's own report to the Legislative Yuan, the Sino-American Treaty permits the translation of American publications but prohibits reprinting. Some people worry that even translation is prohibited. For example, according to one interpretation, if American works are registered or copyrighted with the Chinese authorities, then these publications should receive full protection from the Chinese government. We hope that the foreign affairs authorities will clarify this point.</p>
<p>However, we also feel that the prohibition of reprinting in the Sino-American Treaty is superfluous. China is a scientifically backward country, and the number of Chinese people who can read English books is already pitifully small. Even the number of people who can afford Chinese books is not very large. This restriction on reprinting does not benefit American publishers much, because the number of sales in China is very small. On the contrary, I think that scattering some pirated editions among Chinese bookstores can still have an advertising and promotional effect for the original authors. Furthermore, from the perspective of Chinese readers eager for Western knowledge, this only prohibits them from reading more Western books.</p>
<p>To be honest, if reprinting and translation were not restricted by the Sino-American Treaty and both parties were free to reprint and translate, it would benefit China, because judging from the current state of publishing in China and the United States, China could gain more from American works than the United States could gain from Chinese works. However, we must realize that American businesses have gained too much from the signing of this Sino-American Treaty. The United States is a powerful country, and even if it suffers a slight loss in this area, it can easily compensate for it in other areas, especially since this is greatly related to the exchange of Chinese and Western cultures!</p>
<p>This Sino-American Treaty seems equal on the surface, but it is unequal in essence. I think that what Mr. Sun Yat-sen distinguished between true equality and false equality can also be applied to this aspect. The United States is a country with a highly developed industry and commerce, while China is not. Therefore, if we say that China and the United States can freely navigate, it is equal on the surface, but in reality, the United States has ships, while China has no ships to navigate. Furthermore, if we say that China and the United States can freely trade, but more American goods are sold to China, while very few Chinese goods are sold to the United States, isn't this unequal?</p>
<p>If this is the case, why is navigation and trade open, while reprinting publications is prohibited? Chinese publishing circles only feel that our foreign affairs authorities have not considered the cultural future of China.</p>
<h3>Reading "A Teacher's Diary"</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Author: Feng Zikai Publisher: Wanguang Bookstore</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Zikai's "A Teacher's Diary" was published in Chongqing in June 1944, and re-published in Shanghai this June. A small part of it was published in various magazines in the rear areas between 1939 and 1940. Seven years ago, I received the "Cosmic Wind" magazine from a friend in Hong Kong and read an excerpt from "A Teacher's Diary," which was the first revelation. Since then, I had not seen it again.</p>
<p>From that first published diary entry, I glimpsed how an artist living a peaceful life abruptly left Yuan Yuan Hall and led his family on a difficult westward journey, and I felt deeply moved. Unfortunately, I was unable to see more records of his life after that. Now that Mr. Feng has published his diary, I spent two evenings reading it under the lamp, with the same feelings I had when I first read that diary. My emotions seemed to rise and fall with the author's emotions, and I was savoring the life of this artist.</p>
<p>In literary works, generally speaking, biographies and diaries are the most touching, because both are real records of the author's personal experiences. They can express the beauty of a person's individuality and personality, and among the two, diaries are the easiest to move people. Biographies are sometimes written by others, while diaries are always written by oneself. If we acknowledge the natural flexibility of short essays in expression, we will certainly find diaries even more endearing. The creation of short essays is not like grand treatises, not as serious and solemn as writing "great articles." Sometimes it is just about accidental feelings, fragmentary observations, with no attempt to meticulously describe the shape, thus it feels profound and interesting. Generally speaking, writing is rooted in nature, and what is inspired by the essence of one's spirit and what is revealed by practical experience must be more genuine and without pretense, natural and without carving. In this way, diaries are more in line with the conditions of natural expression. The diaries of various masters of the late Ming and Qing dynasties are still being recited by people, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Like Mr. Zikai's diary, although it is only a thin one hundred and sixty pages, we can see from it the epitome of his wartime life and understand his usual life attitude. His heart is completely immersed in art, and even in the most difficult and disappointing situations, he still has a passionate heart full of hope. We all know how deep Mr. Feng's artistic attainments are. Artists have a sensitivity that surpasses ordinary people. They can truly appreciate and contemplate everything in the world and restore its original appearance, without being blinded by the various temptations and prejudices of the outside world. Therefore, they can shorten the distance between people and achieve the leisurely realm of "observing all things quietly and naturally." The reason why human beings have hatred, suspicion, and jealousy is that the boundaries between people have not been broken. The "self-image" and "self-attachment" mentioned by Buddhists are indeed the source of stinginess and greed. After reading "A Teacher's Diary," we will definitely be able to appreciate how noble and precious the mind of an enlightened artist is.</p>
<p>This "A Teacher's Diary," as the name implies, records his teaching career. The content includes the author's entire life teaching at Guilin Art Normal School after his westward journey, and then continuing to teach at Zhejiang University after leaving Guilin Art Normal School. A part of this can also be seen in the diary. The author taught at Guilin Art Normal School and Zhejiang University, completely adopting an enlightening method of teaching that did not focus on rote learning. What he was responsible for was the art department. He did not focus on imitation and copying, but on stimulating students' creative spirit and improving students' appreciation ability. What was especially important was to connect art with real life. The author believes that to achieve the purpose of art education, the entire life must be permeated with artistic elements to realize "artistic life" and "life artistized." Indeed, art cannot be isolated. Art that is isolated from real life cannot be called art. The author also wants us to open up another boundary outside the boundaries of reason and pragmatism, then "the world is always new, and everywhere is a beautiful boundary." How can this realm be appreciated by those who are busy with fame and fortune and enslaved by material desires?</p>
<p>After reading "A Teacher's Diary," we can know that Mr. Feng is not only an artist but also an ideal educator. His diary is full of love for young people. In addition to paying attention to teaching materials and teaching methods, teachers also need to have a loving heart. If teachers cannot sincerely love students and cannot use passionate love to nourish students' minds, then they will certainly not achieve the effect of education. Mr. Feng's every word and deed to his students often revealed a deep love in individual conversations and accidental encounters. He is worthy of being a "teacher," using his personality to influence his students. That kind of care and concern, just like treating his own children, can be said to be completely from the heart, without any pretense, especially in the details. I think the author was influenced by Mr. Li Shutong (i.e., Master Hongyi) and Mr. Xia Gengzun, because these two were Mr. Feng's teachers, and he had been influenced by their personalities.</p>
<p>The diary writes the most about the scenes of the war, with records of heroic deeds, exposures of the enemy's atrocities, inspiring words, and feelings from the depths of the heart. Although sometimes it is inevitable to be indignant and lament, he never despaired or declined. He firmly believes that China's War of Resistance will be victorious, because he sees thousands of young people growing up in the War of Resistance, and thousands of descendants of the Yellow Emperor fighting with their blood and flesh in the torrent of the war of resisting aggression. His optimistic spirit about the War of Resistance is as admirable as his tireless spirit of teaching people. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, his words may seem meaningless, but in fact, it was very difficult for him to maintain such a belief in victory at that time. Especially after each setback and damage (such as the Great Bombing of Guilin), he did not show any decline or disappointment. Speaking of the hardships of wartime life, he always says "good fortune comes from misfortune," and in fact, this War of Resistance is an opportunity for the rebirth of China.</p>
<p>In this diary, the lines are also filled with a strong human touch. At a glance, one can see the depth of the author's artistic cultivation. Even a small thing in life can be given an artistic perspective, and the trivial matters around him become a valuable source of life. Occasional small talks can set off endless deep meaning. A kind of gentle demeanor of the benevolent is the fusion of Confucianism and Taoism, and it is expressed by deeply understanding the essence of art.</p>
<p>There are also many records of exchanges with writers. The most frequently mentioned in the diary are Chuan Binran, Bing Xin, Song Yunbin, Tang Xianzhi, Xia Gengzun, and Master Hongyi. His wife, Li Min, and his children, Chen Bao, Yan Zhan, Ci Ying, Yi Yin, and his newborn son, Xin Mei, are even more frequently mentioned in the diary. The harmonious and warm atmosphere in the family indeed nourished the author's lonely heart during his escape. Family jokes, which ordinary people find meaningless, become moving descriptions under Mr. Zikai's pen. If it were not for an artist with unique insights, who would appreciate the beauty of life and enjoy the pleasure of being with family and children in the tense life of the war?</p>
<p>The conversations of rural women and wild people, and the songs of cowherds and woodcutters fully express the nature and simplicity of agricultural society; and the author's life is permeated with these elements. At the same time, the author also understands the true meaning of the philosophy of life. He has a vitality that is full in his thoughts, so what he says, even if it is very ordinary, can also give people a profound and fresh feeling.</p>
<p>Anyone who has read Mr. Zikai's "Yuan Yuan Hall Essays" and "Yuan Yuan Hall Re-Essays" will definitely understand his attitude towards life. We always feel that his essays have a simple and distant artistic conception. He sees all things in the universe, and none is not beautiful. He feels that all things in the world are worthy of people's appreciation and understanding. In his diary, we can also see this attitude towards life. Also, his writing is relaxed and lively, without a trace of carving. This is not so much the naturalness of his writing as it is the simplicity of his character. Recently, he has published a collection of essays entitled "Simplicity Collection." I think the reason why Mr. Zikai's life is so desirable is because of his simplicity.</p>
<p>Because his life is natural and simple, his diary contains a strong sense of humor, both solemn and humorous, which is quite fascinating. His writing does not have unique and wonderful places, but in the ordinary, it can show unique and wonderful things. He has already achieved the point of imparting great principles in simplicity, imparting world affairs in satire, and finding pure and beautiful charm in lightness. This may be the reason why Mr. Zikai's diary can arouse the love of most people?</p>
<p>Mr. Zikai's cartoons are unique, with the advantage of clear lines and realistic expression. I think his diary also has this characteristic.</p>
<h3>A General Discussion of Chinese Historiography</h3>
<p>— Written by Mu</p>
<p>Author: Zhu Xizu Publisher: Independent Publishing House</p>
<p>A general understanding of the various systems of Chinese historiography is essential for every friend who loves history. Young people, in general, must understand the developmental process of history, and they should also pay attention to the development of historiography. This is because historical records are not necessarily reliable. Throughout history, most have been "official histories" based on imperial chronicles, and these records inevitably contain inaccuracies. Understanding the development of historiography allows one to distinguish between truth and falsehood, providing a great deal of help in reading history.</p>
<p>This book, "A General Discussion of Chinese Historiography," is based on the author's lecture notes from the Department of History at Peking University, compiled by his son-in-law, Luo Xianglin. It provides us with a concise overview of Chinese historiography, allowing us to understand the development of Chinese historiography throughout history.</p>
<p>First, the author discusses the origin of Chinese historiography. Regarding the basic meaning of the word "史" (history), the "Shuowen Jiezi" (Explaining and Analyzing Characters) says, "史 is one who records events. It follows '又' (hand) holding '中' (middle), meaning impartiality." The author provides a brief explanation and examples of its use. He then explains that history includes written records, records kept by scribes, falsely attributed records, and history inferred from ancient artifacts before the advent of writing. He discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these various historical systems, which were not called "history" in the old days. The "history" of that time was merely the not-very-accurate "official history" produced by scribes, which gradually developed and nurtured the seeds of history.</p>
<p>Regarding the schools of Chinese historiography, the author discusses six schools, spanning from the Spring and Autumn period to the present day. These six schools are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Annals: Distinguished by time, also known as chronological history. This type of history began after the Western Zhou dynasty. The era before the Western Zhou is unclear, so this system did not exist before that time. Common examples of this type of history include comprehensive works such as the "Zizhi Tongjian" (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government) and individual works such as the "Spring and Autumn Annals."</p>
<p>(2) National Histories: Distinguished by place, also known as local history. This type of history collects and examines the history of various ancient states. The ancient states, both large and small, cannot be simplified. Comprehensive examples include the "Records of the Three Kingdoms," and individual examples include the "Chronicles of Huayang."</p>
<p>(3) Biographies: Distinguished by people. Within these biographies, "one can glimpse the level of civilization in a place and the gains and losses of society." Common examples include "Biographies of Women" and "Unofficial Biography of Dongfang Shuo."</p>
<p>(4) Political History and Cultural History: Distinguished by subject. Political history includes economic history, legal history, military and political history, social party history, and diplomatic history. Cultural history includes academics, religion, literature, art, agriculture, industry, commerce, customs, and other items. Examples of the former include the "Tongdian" (Comprehensive Statutes) and "Tongkao" (Comprehensive Examination of Institutions), and the "Tang Liudian" (Six Statutes of the Tang Dynasty). Examples of the latter include "Bielu" (Separate Records), "Qilue" (Seven Summaries), "Song Yuan Xue'an" (Case Studies of Song and Yuan Scholars), and "Poetry Criticism," etc.</p>
<p>(5) Official History: The so-called official history is not written by one person at one time, but is a "official history" accumulated over generations, such as the Twenty-Four Histories.</p>
<p>(6) Chronicle of Events from Beginning to End: Histories written about the beginning and end of an event. This system was created by Yuan Shu of the Song Dynasty. Examples include "Chronicle of Events from Beginning to End of the Comprehensive Mirror," "Chronicle of Events from Beginning to End of the Three Feudatories," and "Chronicle of Events from Beginning to End of Western Xia."</p>
<p>The above six types are only a brief outline. The book discusses them in detail in separate sections.</p>
<p>There are two appendices. One explains "Taishigong Jie" (Understanding the Grand Historian), elaborating on Sima Qian's writing of history. It is best to refer to Jian Bozan's "Historical Materials and Historiography," specifically the article "Sima Qian's Historiography," for a more detailed understanding. The other appendix is an examination of the compilation of annals for the twelve emperors of the Han Dynasty, from Emperor Gaozu of Han, through Emperor Hui, Empress Lü, Emperor Wen, Emperor Jing, Emperor Wu, Emperor Zhao, Emperor Xuan, Emperor Yuan, Emperor Cheng, Emperor Ai to Emperor Ping. The author describes and lists these twelve emperors' annals, providing a clear and precise indication of the same.</p>
<p>Although this book is concise, its content is quite extensive. Young friends who are just beginning to study history can use it as a good reference. Even if there are omissions, they can still be found, and at this time, it can still serve as a reference for general beginners. The book also points out many errors in historiography.</p>
<p>Today, everyone knows that history is an important discipline in the social sciences. It can't be ignored by every young person. Before reading history, we must understand the various branches of Chinese historiography, so that we can get a lot of convenience when reading history.</p>
<p>This book can serve as a preparation before reading history, and it can also serve as a reference after studying history.</p>
<h3>The Devil's Pool</h3>
<p>— Xu Peiji</p>
<p>Behind the easy and frank narrative, there is a hidden, refined, and elegant charm; this is a unique style of pastoral novels. If you compare the scenery of nature to a small stream formed by mountain springs, although it is a dwindling stream, the gurgling sound of the water still echoes intermittently in the winding cliffs. In the clear riverbed, the gently undulating wave marks on the water surface clearly show the potential of life, constantly jumping there. George Sand's "The Devil's Pool" depicts a simple and unadorned story of a French rural village. After getting used to the magnificent works that reflect the era, it is like drinking a cool drink in the scorching heat; it is like the early autumn, bathing in the warmth of the morning sun in the slightly chilly breeze.</p>
<p>Ah! The development of the story is as simple, straight, and unadorned as the ditch that a farmer plows with his cattle. This ditch may soon be submerged by a second ditch in the vast wilderness, but under the author's pen, the vivid and skillful narrative will forever keep a deep imprint of it in the garden of life.</p>
<p>Look, the typical old farmer of a hundred years ago - the rational Father Maurice - he consoles his son-in-law, he covers up his grief over the loss of his beloved daughter, and advises his young son-in-law to remarry without jealousy. But young and handsome Jeannot, the faithful protagonist of the book, with his full enthusiasm, cherishes the memory of his deceased wife, and in front of his lively children, he is a considerate and loving father. In the village of Bérelles, his sincerity is loved by all the residents, and when he is fascinated by every move of little Marie, he is as foolish as an ignorant child. But that foolishness, in certain situations, can lead to his courageous decisiveness. When he stepped into the house of the widow Guillette, whom his father-in-law, Father Maurice, pointed out to him as a potential wife, he immediately saw the different natures of exaggeration, vanity, and glory. He cleverly withdrew from the false trap. The author does not directly describe the appearance of little Marie, who is innocent and intelligent, but only reflects her inner response through her words and deeds. Her candor and purity, compared with the vanity and affectation of the widow Guillette, is a world apart. Tender, clever, and a daughter of nature, she moved Jeannot, who was approaching his thirties. She won Father Maurice's approval, and she caressed Jeannot's son - little Pierre, who was not yet seven years old. In her eyes, there is no difference between the "love" she receives from others and the "love" she gives to others. But those who receive her "love" clearly feel that there are different weights! At the end of the story, Jeannot, with a near-desperate mood, walks into the house of Mother Guillette - little Marie's mother - to ask little Marie for a final decision on "love." She cannot help but exclaim, "Didn't you feel that I loved you before?" Ah! The reader's heart will also be moved by her frank exclamation. We can easily imagine what an enviable comedy will follow.</p>
<p>In the course of the story, the author uses her skillful technique to weave little Pierre's charming language into the important joints of the whole book, which is extraordinarily appropriate and flavorful. She also depicts the wickedness of Aumord, the landlord. When he was oppressing little Marie and Jeannot's way of punishing him was only to drag him off his horse and press him to the ground; from the author's compassionate heart, we can see the author's view of life and the attitude towards art.</p>
<p>"The artist's faithful portrayal of the society in which he lives is a painful satire. He focuses on sin and suffering; but what should we, the later artists, depict? We will wait for the expectation of seeing death, which is the reward of mankind today, and we will pray for it to be a punishment for evil and a compensation for disaster?"</p>
<p>In George Sand's time in Europe, most art workers were accustomed to revealing the dark side of society and injecting gloomy satire into their works. Dürer (Albrecbt Durct), Michelangelo (Michaelangelo), Holbein (Holbeih), Callot (Callot), and Goya (Goya) strongly satirized the evils of their countries, and their immortal works are historical documents with positive value. We will not deny artists the right to explore and expose the scars of society; but is exposure the only function of art?</p>
<p>Based on her true heart, the author recognized these vulgar and cruel views. She believed that the mission of art is a mission of emotion and love, and that artists should undertake a major poetic work - "We would rather take mild and gentle characters that can be reformed than frightening villains that cause terror, because terror will never correct selfishness, but will only increase it." After affirming his artistic point of view, she issued an ode to "life" - a view of life and the universe.</p>
<p>"We should pay attention to life, not death. We no longer trust the emptiness of the tomb... To live richly, we must appreciate life. Lazarus should leave his dunghill so that people will no longer rejoice in the death of the rich. Everyone should promote happiness, so that the good fortune of a few will not lead to sin and suffering... We can no longer see death as a punishment for prosperity or a comfort for disaster... We will no longer allow any tomb to be the only escape for those whom we do not wish to make happy."</p>
<p>Using her correct thinking to measure the negative attitude held by most people in today's society and the key to happiness that they have abandoned, it is so regrettable.</p>
<p>Writing this, we ask to close the book and meditate on the voices and smiles of the characters in the book, the lively and moving atmosphere, which contains a flavor as fragrant and timeless as an olive. The end of the story is as bright as the sunset after the wind has passed.</p>

<h3>My Recent Life and Writing</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>It was on the afternoon of the 17th of this month at the literary tea party that, due to everyone's temporary interest, I proposed this topic, asking the friends who came to participate to write a little about the trivia around them. The intention was nothing more than to give readers a better understanding of the writers and to add some interest to the publication.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friends who participated that day for not being offended by my method of "assigning a topic and submitting the paper on the spot," everyone put aside their teacups and wrote it in one go. A total of thirty-eight pieces were received at that time, and there were still those who accepted the topic and were expected to submit their papers later.</p>
<p>Now, according to the order in which they were received, the first ten copies that have been sorted out will be published. However, due to the limitation of space, the rest and those received successively will be prepared for publication in the next week. I hope my friends will forgive me. ——Editor</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Writing About the Tea Party</p>
<p>The tea is still bitter, and will always be bitter, and it is precisely because of this bitterness that we cannot forget it. Talking in the bitterness makes one feel refreshed. What's more, the objects of the conversation are all like-minded people who know the bitterness, so they are not afraid of talking too much, and do not distinguish the bitterness of the tea.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>My recent life consists of nothing more than teaching, editing, and writing. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I teach "Selections of Qu" (Chinese Operatic Songs), "History of Chinese Novels," and "Chinese Language and Literature Department Composition" at the Department of Chinese Language and Literature at National Fudan University in Jiangwan. On Tuesday afternoons, I teach "History of Chinese Drama" at the Municipal Experimental Drama School.</p>
<p>I am the chief editor at Beixin Bookstore, editing the monthly magazine "Youth World." This publication has a history of more than ten years and is a comprehensive publication aimed at middle school and university students. Before the war, its sales reached tens of thousands of copies. It is currently being published as Volume 2, Number 3 of the new series. In addition, I publish the "Popular Literature" weekly in the Da Wan Bao every Tuesday, and the "Vulgar Literature" weekly in the Central Daily News every Thursday. Mr. Dai Wangshu and Mr. Ye Dejun, who write for the Spring and Autumn section of this newspaper, are the basic contributors to these two publications. Researching Chinese novels and dramas has almost become my addiction.</p>
<p>Because life is busy, and there is no whole block of time, I cannot write a systematic and complete work, but only write sporadic articles for various publications, but I am always struggling to cope, and I feel like I have nothing to say. Most of what I write is textual research on novels and dramas, and occasionally I also write a little about my reading and viewing experiences. All publications hope that I will write literary memoirs, but I have already published "Literary Profiles" and "Literary Impressions." Although I have met many new literary people, I do not have a deep friendship with them. The biggest regret is that I do not have time to read each writer's works carefully, so what I force myself to write is not profound. I think writing this kind of article is the most old-fashioned thing.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>I'm afraid that I won't be able to write articles if I don't have enough to eat.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>When Jinshan came to collect articles, the threshold was too high. As soon as I sat down, before I could talk to him, he gave me a topic and asked me to submit the paper, which is the way to test new students. It's really a bit overwhelming. Fortunately, there is no limit to the number of words or the style, so I will "take the exam" once.</p>
<p>I came from Hankou this time and passed through Shanghai to Peiping. Since the sixth of this month until today, I have been living a traveling life, so I am very unstable. But it is a very happy thing to be able to meet friends that I haven't met in more than ten or even twenty years!</p>
<p>As for writing, I am very ashamed. The "Victory Travelogue" that I plan to write has just begun. After I get settled in Peiping, I plan to finish writing the two long novels, "Great Fire's Woman" and "In the Flames of War." In addition, I want to read more books.</p>
<p>I have been away from Shanghai for more than nine years. It really makes me very happy to be able to meet many old friends today. I want to talk, so I will stop writing here.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Recently, I returned to my hometown, which I had not returned to for ten years. After returning to Shanghai, I originally wanted to write some essays like reflections to give to Jinshan. It happened that the Noon News was published, and the editor asked me to continue writing "Baby Diary." So I changed my plan, but after writing a few paragraphs, the baby became spoiled and refused to write anymore. Coincidentally, Bing Xin came from Hankou. She wanted to go to Peiping to edit the monthly magazine "Literature and Life" and asked me for "literary works." I thought I would give her this unfinished Baby Diary, but the baby's age is too young, and I am afraid that she will not be able to withstand the hardship of the journey. Moreover, the season has entered winter, and Peiping is freezing cold, and I am even more afraid that my baby will not be able to bear it; so I had to think of another way.</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Speaking of my life, it is really not worth mentioning. I remember that in the 20s, when I was studying at school, I read the debate on the scientific view of life, in which Mr. Wu Zhihui's view of life was three items: "eating, having sons, and entertaining friends." In the past twenty years, my life has been nothing more than these three items; in my recent life, except for the second item, which I am not prepared to expand, the third item has always been the same, and every time I decide to participate in a literary tea party, I just want to greet more friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, I am very ashamed. I am busy every day to eat, working as a lawyer and doing business at the same time. I really don't often write. If the editor wants me to write an article, of course I dare not refuse.</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to handling fixed routine official business every day, in my spare time, I also took on the special writing of two or three publications, that is, I am busy all day long. I don't have a share in the dance hall, and at most I just watch movies. I don't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, and this has been the case for more than thirty years. In addition to writing, reading books and newspapers are also things that I must do every day.</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>Now I am busy giving lessons at the Shangchuan, Chengming, and Meizhuan schools, rushing to meet the time, and squeezing onto the bus. It can be said that "there is no time to rest all day long"; therefore, the effort of writing is also very minimal. Before the summer vacation, I still painted every day, but now I can only paint one or two paintings a week, and I can barely write one or two short articles; as for the "Great Dictionary of Names of Chinese Painters" that I planned to add to and revise, and the "Great Collection of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties" that I compiled, I cannot proceed with them, and I can only wait until life is a little more leisurely before I can study them carefully.</p>

<p>Life is dull, but there is poetry to prove it:</p>
<p>"Everything seen must be recorded, everything heard must be written, there is no holiday in the four seasons, when will it rest? Long gatherings only teach estranged friendship, but at the parting, I compose a farewell sorrow!" (First)</p>
<p>"Spring flowers and autumn moons pass by casually, snails compete with roc, and all are in the net, but I hate that the pen is bald for a long time, what to do with deleting poems, books, and history!" (Second)</p>
<p>"Dancing like a startled swan, graceful like a dragon, floating clouds and world affairs are the same in the nine provinces, please enter the jar, don't laugh at me, I am also confused in the painting." (Third)</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, I spent my life with chalk, was trapped in Jiangnan, and participated in guerrilla work, suffering from wind and frost. After the victory, I became a civil servant for the first time, perhaps luckily, and the job was very leisurely, so the work of reading and writing was openly carried out at the desk. After Xiao Qian returned to China, he was in charge of the literary compilation of the Dagong Newspaper, and asked me to write book reviews for "Literature" regularly. Living in an unstable place and a turbulent life, it is inconvenient to collect many reference books, and it is not easy to search and purchase them. I know that I cannot give many examples in my writing; writing a book review cannot discuss the entire creative process of the author in detail, which makes me feel uneasy and embarrassed in my heart.</p>
<p>Eleven</p>
<p>I am a current primary school teacher. Speaking of primary school education, it should be so important, and those who are engaged in education should dedicate all their energy and all their time to our later generations. But now is an era when eight or nine out of ten things are unsatisfactory, and cultural people naturally cannot forget about literature and art.</p>
<p>I am currently writing short stories, but this era often cannot complete a work as you wish. Of course, there are many reasons for this, the most important of which is the writing environment. In an atmosphere where the whole life cannot be stable, the creation of literary works is difficult.</p>
<p>Twelve</p>
<p>Speaking of life, it seems that recently it is the same as in the past, and there is no change. The week before last, I went home and spent some more leisurely life, appreciating some of the mountains in late autumn, and tasting the flavor of Wang Si Restaurant's "Oiled Chicken" that I had not tasted for eight years.</p>
<p>Recently, my "Four Great Painters of the Ming Dynasty" has been completely arranged and proofread by World Publishing Company, and "Research on Color Science" has been contracted with me by the Commercial Press for royalties. Therefore, it aroused my interest in writing long articles again, and I prepared to complete a 30,000-word "A Brief History of Emerging Chinese Art" before the end of the year. I really want to write it from a "materialist" point of view. This is an attempt. I don't know if I will be able to write it.</p>
<p>Thirteen</p>
<p>This semester, I took classes at Dongyi University and the Provincial Suzhou Industrial Vocational School, etc., plus the various things in the local area, I was so busy that I had no time to read. Recently, I came to Shanghai, and although I am still busy, it is much better. Every one or two weeks, I return to Suzhou, and sometimes I go to Hangzhou, and my life has added a lot of interest. Stealing leisure from busyness, I really want to read some famous works of classical literature. For the time being, I don't want to write, what I want to prepare is to write "A General History of China," but this is not a casual matter, and I don't dare to say now that I will definitely start writing.</p>
<p>Fourteen</p>
<p>Recently, in my spare time at the bank, because I am the chief editor of the local newspaper "Dong Bao" in Pudong, it has affected the time for creating. I hope that I have some time to sort out the manuscripts of "Special Ethnic Groups in Guangxi" first, and then write the two books "Research on Pangu" and "Exploration of Flood Legends and the Myth of Fuxi Creating Humans." As for the outlines of the two books "Collection of Customs in the Southwest" and "Collection of Drama Criticism" have been roughly completed, and if there is an opportunity for publication, they can be sorted out and sent to print immediately.</p>
<p>Fifteen</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan gave the topic and ordered, "Submit the paper on the spot!" Although the brain juice is dry, and I twist it horizontally and vertically, I can't squeeze out a drop. But the order to submit the paper on the spot, ah! Dare not obey!</p>
<p>In the past, life was often, perhaps because I was a bachelor, I had wine, I got drunk; I had money, I used it; I had time, I played; it was a lot of fun! Walking at night and swimming in the garden in the rain were commonplace. Perhaps it was because of the war that it seemed impossible for a person's temperament to be calm in a chaotic world.</p>
<p>Recently, I have changed. To quote a literary buzzword, I have changed my style. I'm sorry, it's not because I have a wife. (My wife is a "rat" from Hedong, but she can't roar like a lion, she's really a stupid donkey!) However, I ask myself that life should be organized. Perseverance and hard work require determination.</p>
<p>Therefore, recently I have been determined to try the tempering of life!</p>
<p>Recently, although I really want to write, I lack the childish naivety and the spirit of hard work. What I lack even more is trust in myself. Except for occasional translations, I really don't dare to write. I really don't dare to write.</p>
<p>Sixteen</p>
<p>I am a news practitioner. During the Anti-Japanese War, I worked in the rear newspaper industry. Because I had lived in the north for a long time, I was not accustomed to the life in the southwest, and the friends in the rear were gradually leaving, giving me a feeling of living alone! So I left Jincheng on October 21 and came to Nanjing and Shanghai to see friends I hadn't seen for a long time. In two or three days, I will go to the old capital I haven't seen for a long time to engage in the news business.</p>
<p>Seventeen</p>
<p>For eight years, I lingered in Shanghai, which was shrouded in demonic atmosphere, and I did not act as a traitor. I only closed my doors and painted all year round; sometimes I wrote a few short poems to express my feelings. Many friends thought that I, who was as poor as I am, must have starved to death; friends who cared about me asked me about my recent life, and I only asked him to look at the couplet I wrote in my studio, which read: "Read books for half a day, paint for half a day. Sometimes grow vegetables, sometimes plant flowers." This is a realistic description of my life, but I feel that I have accomplished nothing, and I am getting old, and I feel very sorry for my friends who care about me.</p>
<p>Eighteen</p>
<p>Everyone knows that running news is the most free job. It is certainly enviable to be able to develop freely without constraints. However, there are also very brain-consuming aspects to entering this circle. Every day, I chase clues, rush to manage time, regardless of day and night, regardless of distance, and drill and interview everywhere. I live in this situation every day. But I am very happy, I find it very interesting, and my mood is happy.</p>
<p>Because I focus on news reports, I have inadvertently become indifferent to literary writing. But it is not an abandonment, it is not a disgust, but in reality, it is the lack of time, so in addition to news articles, and writing some news features, recently I can say that I have not written anything else.</p>
<p>Nineteen</p>
<p>Because I participated in the Anti-Japanese War, I joined the Air Force. Years of mechanical life made me feel bored, so in order to adjust my mind, I engaged in writing and researching characters. In the past three years, I wrote a book called "Victory Characters," changed the manuscript eight times, and made a plan for new characters, retaining the characteristics of old Chinese characters and adopting the strengths of characters from various countries. It has solved the problem of homophones in phonetic characters and the problem of dialects. It is now beginning to be published and made available to the cultural circles for research and guidance.</p>
<p>Twenty</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan:</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern in asking about my "life" and "writing." I am really sorry, recently my life has been very simple. In addition to reading newspapers and magazines every day, I have simply done nothing. On the one hand, it is because the store is busy and I don't have a quiet mind to write. No! Frankly speaking, I am not qualified enough. However, I am a lover of literature and art. Although my strength is insufficient, I want to learn and dedicate my sincere heart to learning. I hope for more guidance in the future. It would be best if the "Literary Tea Party" could set up a "Literary Writing Guidance Group."</p>
<h3>To the Literary Salon</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>How could our flourishing culture lack gentlemen like you, with your elegant pursuits, even more so with such great figures; I come to boil snow and offer a long greeting, as we sit and chat, both intimate and familiar.</p>
<p>It was last week, I believe! Chen Chengyin invited me to the "Literary Salon." Originally, I also wanted to see Sun Fuxi and Hualin. It just so happened that I also ran into Zhao Jingshen, so I wasn't lonely after all. Although this grand occasion of the Literary Salon was my first time participating; it is said that it was established as far back as fourteen years ago, but before those fourteen years, I remember often going to Sun Fuxi's house. At that time, I was still young, and being in contact with this person who truly possessed "literature" and "art," and was also a refined recluse, moved me greatly. His large bow tie, long hair, and amiable conversation have been deeply imprinted in the heart of this weary traveler for many years and will not fade away. At that time, he ran the "Art Wind" magazine. Because of a traveler's life of moving around, my time in Shanghai was very short. Apart from occasionally writing one or two short pieces for the local supplement of this newspaper at the time, I didn't contribute to any other publications. Soon after, I arrived in Nanjing, where life was relatively stable, but the endless official documents made my head spin. I lived in "Sheepskin Lane," constantly looking out at the river embankment and sparse willows, and longing for Bai Lixi's five ramskins. In this era, how could poor scholars raise their status? So, whenever I had free time, I would pick up my pen and dispel my sorrows. The "Central Park" section of the Central Daily News, edited by Hualin, could be said to be my park for dispelling sorrows. "Baihua" was the pen name I started using to commemorate my deceased mother. The veteran writer Zong Baihua didn't take offense to it. He wrote for the supplement of the Central Daily News, and it seemed to become a parallel and non-conflicting situation. I remember once, Hualin published my article twice on the same day, using both my original name and pen name. Gradually, my original name faded away, and many friends called me by my pen name. A short story in "Art Wind" called "Moon" was also sent from Nanjing at that time. It can be said that my interest in writing had grown strong, so although I didn't participate in the Literary Salon, I formed a literary connection with its founders.</p>
<p>Now, fourteen years later, before the Literary Salon has been restored at the fifth floor of the Great New World, I have formed another connection with the friends of the Literary Salon; it was at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. The "Literary World" monthly magazine that I co-edited with Wei Jinzhi was discontinued because it couldn't maintain its circulation. At the same time, Guo Lanxin wanted me to edit a certain newspaper's supplement, but I left because of the fee issue. I only taught at the Zhijiang Law and Politics School and felt very bored. At this time, Lu Danlin was editing "The Beginning of Man" and invited me to help him. Perhaps it was a response to a shared desire, we got along very well. And there was Chen Chengyin, whom I had often met for many years, and still do to this day. It was from Xu Zhongnian's article that I learned that they were both key figures in the Literary Salon. I am an outsider to literature and art, and besides, in my middle-aged sorrow, I can no longer muster the courage to "write at a gallop." However, the vague past and present circumstances have made me feel a little warmth and closeness towards the Literary Salon. When I shook hands with Sun Fuxi again, he said:</p>
<p>"You haven't changed a bit!"</p>
<p>This made me smile bitterly. More than ten years have passed, how could I still be the same? There were many people there that day, and Chengyin tirelessly introduced me to them. I thought of "The gentleman's transformation is like the leopard's, his culture becomes resplendent." The "culture" of literature and art should be metaphysical in order to achieve the flourishing of moral accomplishment. "Engaging in the arts" is even more of an edict from the former sages, but the "great figure" I speak of in my poem doesn't necessarily refer to a great figure who is tall. The original meaning of the word "great" is "large." Why does literature and art stem from tea and not wine? I agree with this very much. Wine can lead to recklessness, while tea can clear the mind. Outside the passes, snow is flying. If we were to boil tea with snow water, that would be even better. See "Collection of Affairs and Literature":</p>
<p>"When he obtained the position of Grand Commandant, he took snow water to brew tea and said, 'Does the Dang family have this pleasure?' He replied, 'How would they know this? They can only drink lamb wine under gold-embroidered tents.'"</p>
<p>In this way, the friends of the Literary Salon, gathering in a "place adorned with books," will not fall into clichés. This has already been explained in the points for improvement discussed by Chen Chengyin, Hualin, and Xu Zhongnian in "Spring and Autumn" a few days ago. With a little warmth and a sense of closeness, I wrote this poem that is not very good.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes from the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>When Chen Shiyi lived in Suzhou, he was already eighty years old. He usually regarded himself as the chief priest of the poetry circle, relying on his age to act old. Shao Tanqiu from Nanchang happened to pass through Wumen and was introduced to Chen by Jin Songcen. Chen Shiyi regarded him as a young whippersnapper and looked at him with disdain. Shao Tanqiu was furious and pointed out more than ten errors in Chen Shiyi's poetry, questioning him about them. Chen Shiyi was dumbfounded and couldn't answer. The next day was the Shangsi Festival, and there was a gathering at Black Dragon Pool in Nanjing, hosted by Cao Lianheng, Shao Yuanchong, and others, who honored Chen Shiyi as their leader. Shao Tanqiu then wrote an article titled "Poetry Calamity," severely criticizing the shamelessness of poets who promoted each other, leaving Chen Shiyi completely battered and bruised. Observers all praised Shao Tanqiu for being forthright and decisive. Chen Shiyi suffered a major blow and began to look at Shao Tanqiu with new respect, no longer daring to act old.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 99</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Therefore, this kind of "five-level test" was not easy to pass. The best score required forty-eight hours. That is to say, from the first to the fifth level tests, you answered satisfactorily, with no "illogical" points, and at the same time, you could endure the torture under each test. However, it was also common to get through with some lobbying, which made the tests more lenient. For example, when Tsurumi Tama returned to China for testing this time, there was a strong figure who had already lobbied for him in advance; because Tsurumi was a top talent among the "young and vigorous faction," the society should recruit him, so after only forty-eight hours of various procedures, he completed all the "initiation ceremonies" at midnight that day.</p>
<p>At this time, Tsurumi had passed the five-level test and successfully became a member of the Black Dragon Society, which gave him a lot of convenience in exploring the "seven secret letters." Although he was quite excited, he was physically exhausted, and he couldn't forget the disclosure work after he obtained the "seven secret letters," so he thought of going to Ueno Park to relax, both to restore some energy and to clarify all his thoughts, in preparation for the next step of work.</p>
<p>Who knew that just after taking a few steps, he suddenly felt someone coming out from under the eaves of the building corner, following him. Ordinary people would not feel anything in such situations. Tsurumi had things on his mind and had received quite rigorous training. He himself was doing this kind of thing, so he could easily detect it. Moreover, it was already midnight, and there were few pedestrians on the road, so it was easy to distinguish whether the person was following him or was just an ordinary pedestrian.</p>
<p>However, Tsurumi was not surprised to find someone following him, only silently noting "one" in his mind. That is to say, he had discovered one tail. Little did he know that just after noting one, there were as many as five more, who came out from the dark corners on the left and right sides of the street, hanging back at a considerable distance, following closely. If it were just the Black Dragon Society sending people to complete the procedures, creating a kind of "pledge of allegiance," then to Tsurumi, it would be a childish game, and he wouldn't be flustered at all. But how could Tsurumi, who carried one, two, or even three layers of secrets, be careless?</p>
<p>"Are they the hounds of the Orchid Group? Are they the mortal enemies of the Black Dragon Society, the Jiangchuan Restoration Society? (Most of the members of this Restoration Society are former Tokugawa faction members, who are politically opposed to the Black Dragon Society in domestic affairs.) Or are they other emerging, hidden and dangerous enemies?" Because at this time, the war of aggression against China had already been brewing successfully; the military, political, and financial circles, filled with guys greedy for fame and wealth, had already established many factions, competing for interests abroad and power at home, or even competing for both power and interests; the factions were fighting with each other, and their subordinates had assassins, specializing in assassination work.</p>
<p>In normal times, let alone just five or six people, Tsurumi wouldn't have paid any attention to them. Even if there were twice as many, he would have weighed their strength first, joked with them, and then talked. You must know that Tsurumi's "judo" was close to the seventh dan, and it was usually easy to deal with ten or so people. His "kendo" had also passed the fifth dan, and he had learned from renowned kendo masters of the time, and could use special techniques to fight swords barehanded; as for marksmanship, in addition to receiving a special shooting skill award at the Army University, he had won the top prize in the military's suburban "Wumu" regiment. But why did he come to Tokyo? Why did he join the Black Dragon Society? Wasn't it all to reveal the secret of the seven secret letters of several international masterminds?</p>

<h3>Blood Plasma</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The blood plasma trading case has become one of the trendy topics. In fact, just like other commodities such as automobiles, steel, aircraft equipment, military blankets, and ration food boxes, what's so different about it? However, because it is blood plasma, something fresh and bloody from inside the human body, everyone pays special attention to it.</p>
<p>The United States Foreign Liquidation Commission should be held responsible for this incident. First, the merchants purchased it from the Liquidation Office through formal procedures; it was neither stolen nor smuggled. Second, the blood plasma was mixed among many items; no one knew about it beforehand, and the Liquidation Office never announced a ban on trading it. Third, the term "black market" is not very appropriate here. Wholesalers bought it in large quantities, added interest, freight, and consumption costs, and then wholesaled it to various pharmacies, so naturally they had to raise the selling price. Pharmacies publicly marked the price for sale; is this a black market? Is raising the selling price a black market?</p>
<p>Since they sold it themselves, how can they say that the buyers are violating the law? If it is a violation, the first violator is the seller. Therefore, the most regrettable thing is that they lacked careful consideration when they first offered it for sale.</p>
<p>Now this batch of blood plasma has been sealed up, and those who engaged in this profitable business are truly left between tears and laughter. They now say that as long as there is a reasonable price, it can be confiscated. Although there will be losses, there is nothing they can do. They hope that the organizers can consider this solution; otherwise, merchants will not dare to trade with the Liquidation Commission in the future.</p>
<h3>A Rapid, Decisive, and Painful Primitive Judicial Performance: A Report from a Foreign Reporter</h3>
<p>— Liaoran</p>
<p>American news reporter William Ayers once lived in the Communist Party's "Liberated Area" in Shandong for some time. After returning to Shanghai, he recently published several articles in the English-language "China Press" in this city, recalling the "Liberated Area." The most interesting article is the one that describes how the Communists handled Han Hao. Because from this article, we can see how the Communist Party's judicial organs are organized, how they exercise their powers, and what the Communist Party's judicial concepts are. The article begins by describing the peace and tranquility of the Chinese countryside. Suddenly, the article writes: "Secretary Hu said, 'There will be a mass meeting this afternoon...we are going to execute someone.'" The matter is so sudden, and the local number one traitor is going to be tried. There was no prior announcement or news coverage; the leaders of various groups firmly organized by the Communist regime received the following order: "Select a number of people from your group to attend the meeting this afternoon." There was no preliminary hearing, which is in stark contrast to the International Military Tribunal's trial of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<p>At that time, Secretary Hu told me (the reporter said himself) that the traitor did not have to be punished as long as he repented and admitted his crimes. In the following twenty-four hours, the Communists I spoke with all agreed that if the traitor was willing to repent, he would not have to be tried. Every time I heard this sentence, I felt a chill, because this sentence had religious overtones, which is contrary to the Communist Party's materialism. ... The Communist Eighth Route Army's method of dealing with prisoners is to educate them through persuasion, first denouncing the other side's war as wrong, then praising the Communist Party, and finally declaring to him personally that peace is more valuable than war. A persuaded prisoner who expresses repentance and a determination to reform can be released, otherwise he must be tried. The traitor being tried this time, Wang, had been subjected to a year of persuasive education by the Eighth Route Army and did not repent, so he was to be "tried" on August 31. Here, the term "trial" is similar in name but different in reality to the "trial" used by the International Military Tribunal for Japanese war criminals. The trial of the traitor Wang can actually be said to have been held privately during that year of persuasive education. The trial that I witnessed that day was merely the pronouncement of the verdict. There was no need to guess how the verdict would be decided; everyone already knew the outcome.</p>
<p>Plot</p>
<p>About two thousand people were seated. On the platform, the curtain was drawn back, and Judge Sun sat in the center, with two judges from the "government" on his right, and three judges sent by people's organizations. On his left were Prosecutor Yu and the clerk. When the prisoner's truck arrived, there was a moment of silence in the courtroom...I was reminded of the drumbeats of the French Revolution. The truck stopped in front of the stage, and two police officers escorted the prisoner, whose hands were tied behind his back. ... The prosecutor began his argument. ... After the prosecutor finished his argument ... Judge Sun asked, "Is the argument fair?" The defendant replied, "Some parts are wrong, some things I didn't do." Question: "Do you want to call witnesses?" Answer: "I dare not trouble the court." Then Judge Sun walked towards the crowd gathered, asking what opinions the people had. No one spoke. "According to the crimes committed by the defendant, he should be sentenced to death. The court has already discussed this. What are your opinions?" Judge Sun waved his fist in the air and shouted loudly: "Kill!" Then the crowd also shouted three times: "Kill! Kill! Kill!" Judge Sun took out the written verdict from his pocket and read it line by line..." After reading it, the defendant was shot on the spot. (The full text can be found in the English-language "China Press" on November 14)</p>
<p>From the facts observed above, the Communist Party's judicial concept is primitive, backward, and barbaric; it is ten thousand miles away from the modern democratic judicial concept. According to the principles of democratic politics, judicial power and administrative power are separate, but the Communist Party's judiciary is purely an appendage of administration. Communist law has no so-called "principle of legality," and guilt is not necessarily punishable; as long as one is willing to "repent," they can be declared innocent; if one is not willing to repent, they must be sentenced to death. Therefore, the entire Communist judiciary can be encompassed by just eight words: "Those who obey me will live, those who defy me will die." The Communist judiciary is merely a means to achieve political goals; it has no independence in itself. Therefore, as long as the political goal is achieved, the judicial means can be dispensed with, and the defendant will naturally be acquitted. The judges have people's representatives, which seems to be a jury system, but the people's representatives under the Communist Party's rule are nominal only. Even the "masses" attending the meeting are selected by the "group leaders" who are ordered from above to send a certain number of people to participate, so it is easy to imagine that the people's representatives sitting on the jury are even more chosen by the Communist Party themselves. Even if they were truly elected by the people, their task would probably only be to sit on the jury. If the presiding judge did not shout "Kill!", they probably wouldn't dare to shout "Kill!" first. Don't you see those "masses"? When the judge asked them what their opinions were, no one spoke until the judge waved his fist and shouted "Kill!" Then they followed with "Kill! Kill! Kill!" This shows that these jurors are used to deceive the people; their opinions cannot affect the verdict at all. Furthermore, the judicial organ represents the state in exercising criminal penalties, and has the right to punish those who should be held criminally responsible according to the law, without seeking the opinions of the general public; but the Communist judiciary is not like that. On the one hand, the verdict is already known to everyone, and the judge has already written the verdict and put it in his pocket, but on the other hand, he hypocritically asks the masses how to punish the defendant. While their hypocrisy is laughable, this action is completely incompatible with the modern judicial concept!</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Communist judiciary has no appellate system, no so-called appeals, reversals, complaints, or retrials. Once a verdict is made, it is immediately executed. Even if the verdict is improper, there is no way to remedy it. There is also no preliminary hearing, and the trial procedure is very simple. There is only accusation, no defense. The defendant who appears in court is not only physically restricted (wearing handcuffs), but there is also no one familiar with the law to defend him. Therefore, a case can be concluded in just a few tens of minutes, which is vastly different from the year it took to try German war criminals in Nuremberg, the half a year it has taken to try Japanese war criminals in Tokyo, and the several months it takes the Shanghai High Court to try each case of traitors. Modern democratic countries all recognize that the purpose of punishment is to prevent crime, and criminal litigation adopts the principle of discovering the truth in substance. Therefore, the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and evidence favorable or unfavorable to the defendant should be investigated, and the defendant should be given the opportunity to defend himself and the opportunity to make a final statement. The Communist Party believes that the judiciary is the superstructure, and the purpose of punishment is nothing more than to eliminate obstacles to communism, so all so-called trial levels, defenses, investigations, and preliminary hearings are naturally absent. This kind of judiciary is far removed from the judicial concepts of modern democratic countries, so it can be said to be a primitive, backward, and barbaric judicial concept.</p>
<h3>Thoughts from a Photograph</h3>
<p>— Zuiyin</p>
<p>No matter how ferocious a person is, when taking a photograph, they always like to have a bit of a smile; even if they don't smile, they have to put on a kind of look that gives people a good impression of them. The reason why humans are different from animals is probably because they have a bit more of this.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you look at those different faces in the windows of photo studios, you always feel that those people are all "good people," all "smiling," and all powerful and capable; no one lets their ferocious true nature show in the lens. It is said that this is certainly a form of hypocrisy, but social order depends on this for maintenance.</p>
<p>These words were spoken to me by someone not long ago. At the time, I only felt that the person who said these words had quite a bit of insight. Unexpectedly, today, I feel more and more that the above in-depth and simple explanation is truly reasonable!</p>
<p>Look: from Goering in Germany to Zhou Fohai in China, these executioners of war and accomplices of the invaders, when they arrive in court, all give eloquent speeches, talking a blue streak. If we were a little naive, we would really feel that this world is full of benevolent and moral people. Before committing suicide, Goering even tried to transmit his will, speaking grandly about "the future mission of the German people," etc. It's not that he didn't realize he was wrong until his death; he certainly knew that he had been acting recklessly in the past, but even though he understood it in his heart, he couldn't help but "sacredly" talk nonsense, trying to make people see him as a revolutionary. Furthermore, even a heinous traitor like Zhou Fohai had to come up with a set of nonsensical defenses. Fortunately, the men and women compatriots in Shanghai and many other occupied areas are still alive and not too forgetful, otherwise Zhou Fohai's "simply stirring the hearts of the people" eloquent talk would have really plunged us into confusion!</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is that since the public trial of the number one traitor, Chen Gongbo, all the traitors, big and small, have been self-confessed, speaking plausibly. Among them, some knew that they could hardly escape death, but they still refused to be frank and all unanimously released their words, making a "solemn" appearance. This is just like: when taking a photo, even a great bandit who has murdered countless people shows a bit of amiable and friendly appearance.</p>
<p>In this day and age, no one reveals their heart anymore. Everyone is acting in a nonsensical play! No wonder, a few years ago, a baby in Manila died three days later because its heart grew outside its chest!</p>
<h3>Private Life</h3>
<p>— Saint</p>
<p>Starting with Xia Peizhen</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Xia Peizhen, a female movie star second only to Hu Die, was sentenced to one year in prison after the victory because of a drug case. According to reports, she will soon be released. This news reminded me of the past of this red star who once starred in "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple."</p>
<p>In 1932, she joined the Star Film Company and began her life as a movie star in that golden age. At that time, her income, in addition to remuneration, was two hundred yuan per month, and the price for filming one day was seventy yuan. This kind of generous treatment was not comparable to that of ordinary people, but she was therefore infected with the worst habit in the world. Her artistic achievements were destroyed at this point. Later, when she left the Star Film Company, she had a legal dispute with the company, and for a time, she was a well-known news figure. However, the flood-like poison gradually eroded her youth and vitality, leading to a complete collapse, and she rarely performed in the film industry. When we recall this history of an artist's downfall, we also feel endless regret! Reality is always the most ruthless! From Xia Peizhen, I thought of Yuan Meiyun. This pair of red stars with black records both committed the same mistake. Their future was ruined by "one wrong step," and now there is no way to fix it!</p>
<p>The difficult lives of film and drama artists make us sympathize, but precisely because of working day and night and having a freer lifestyle, their private lives are most likely to collapse. A moment's difference in thought can lead to irremediable consequences; I am not preaching here, but as an artist, you must be able to manage yourself and restrain yourself. Otherwise, once emotions are released without restraint, then the Sentimental behaviors of depravity, corruption, and committing suicide will kill individuals and kill art!</p>

<p>After a while, he heard the people below shouting loudly. He knew he must be almost at the top. He opened his eyes and saw Lu Xun standing against the wall, about ten feet away from him. Mi En felt a little dizzy, but not afraid at all. Instead, he felt happy. He said, "Lu Xun!"</p>
<p>"I'm Mi En."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>"I've come here to accompany you down. Don't worry, I'll take care of you."</p>
<p>Lu Xun moved slightly, but did not turn around. He said, "I can only do it. I know people will misunderstand me. But I can't care about so much."</p>
<p>"I had a hard time climbing up," Mi En said happily. "How did you get here anyway?"</p>
<p>Lu Xun said, "I hit him on the head and then shot her. His head didn't break as a result. The stick actually bounced out, hurting my hand so much."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," Mi En said. "Everything is over now."</p>
<p>Lu Xun suddenly raised his head and cried out in a special tone: "Mi En!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Lu Xun!"</p>
<p>Lu Xun paused for a long time, then asked, "Do you think doing this will hurt her heart?"</p>
<p>Mi En replied, "Good heavens! She definitely won't be hurt. She definitely won't feel anything."</p>
<p>"Do you think that's definitely how it is?" Lu Xun asked with a strange laugh.</p>
<p>"I think that's definitely how it is."</p>
<p>"That's great. Then, let's go down now." He stood up immediately.</p>
<p>"Mi En shouted," Stop! Don't do it!" But Lu Xun took a pistol and fired at his own head. With a loud bang, blood splattered, and his body slowly leaned down and lay down.</p>
<p>Mi En listlessly stared at his body, still leaning against the ladder. The people below all shouted. He closed his eyes tightly and cried, "It's all right, there's no need to worry now."</p>
<p>When Mi En got into the car, the police officer handed him a letter, but he didn't have the heart to pay attention to it at all. He simply forgot about it. It wasn't until he got home that he felt it in his pocket and remembered it.</p>
<p>The envelope was addressed to Dr. Mi En. Mi En read it and felt very sad, but it was clearly not written by Lu Xun later. He tore open the envelope and looked at it. Inside were four one-pound notes and two ten-shilling notes.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a long time before putting it back in the envelope, putting it in his pocket, and then closing his eyes. He didn't sleep all night, of course he was so tired that he couldn't support himself anymore. (The End)</p>
<h3>News Figure: Overseas Chinese Tycoon Hu Wenhu</h3>
<p>— Jifeng</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu has arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hu himself, the purpose of this trip is to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing and report on the situation of overseas Chinese. In addition, he will also visit President Song and Minister Yu to seek guidance on the future development of the Fujian Economic Construction Company, which Mr. Hu presides over.</p>
<p>Some newspapers have reported that Mr. Hu enjoys Peking opera and various local operas, and that he even went to the Gong Wu Tai theater to see a stage production with elaborate sets. One evening newspaper even ran the headline: "Hu Wenhu Watches 'Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights'," serving as a free advertisement for Gong Wu Tai.</p>
<p>Thinking of Tiger Balm</p>
<p>Mentioning Hu Wenhu immediately brings to mind the Tiger Balm, Ba Feng Dan, and Headache Powder produced by Tiger Balm Eng Aun Tong. "Tiger Balm Eng Aun Tong" was built up single-handedly by Mr. Hu. Currently, branches are located in Rangoon, Java, Siam, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, Fuzhou, Tianjin, and other places. There are also special agency offices in major ports around the world. The success of its sales is truly remarkable. However, it is said that when Mr. Hu first started the business, he personally led his employees, dressed in colorful tiger costumes, to promote and peddle their products to various businesses, struggling to get by. Eventually, he built his fortune and became a prominent overseas merchant, which was no easy feat.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's ancestral home is Yongding, Fujian, but he was born in Rangoon, Burma. Fifty years before the founding of the Republic of China, his father took a "big-eyed chicken boat" (named so because the sailboats of that time had two large eyes painted on the bow) and went to Rangoon alone to establish Eng Aun Tong Chinese medicine shop, marrying a woman named Li, who gave birth to two sons, Wenhu and Wenbao.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu is known for his generosity and actively supports general charitable and public welfare causes, making him incomparable to those who are merely "charity swindlers." He has initiated the establishment of secondary schools in various overseas locations to provide educational opportunities for the children of overseas Chinese, as well as building hospitals and constructing nursing homes, benefiting the overseas Chinese community significantly. It is worth noting Mr. Hu's concern for national affairs: during the Northern Expedition, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, he invariably donated large sums of money and significant quantities of medicine. During the War of Resistance, he also provided considerable assistance to the motherland.</p>
<p>Starting a Newspaper in Shanghai</p>
<p>Some say that Mr. Hu's visit to Shanghai this time is to prepare for the publication of a Shanghai edition of the Sing Tao newspaper series, to be called "Sing Tao Shanghai Daily," because Mr. Hu's expansion into media ventures is "significant..." Hu Wenhu's newspaper publishing venture began in 1921 when he invested 50,000 yuan in Rangoon to establish the Burma Morning Post. In 1928, he invested 500,000 yuan in Singapore to establish the Sin Chew Daily, dominating the Singaporean newspaper industry. In 1931, he also established the Sing Hua Daily in Shantou. With Mr. Hu's strong financial resources, his newspaper publishing ventures certainly have a good chance of success.</p>
<p>In the Pasir Panjang area of Singapore, Mr. Hu once single-handedly opened a large-scale swimming pool. The pool also included basketball courts, tennis courts, badminton courts, and other facilities. A sign hung at the entrance read, "Only Chinese are allowed to swim inside." This, compared with the sign "Dogs and Chinese not allowed" in Shanghai in the past, truly reflects the changes that have taken place.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu is now sixty-four years old, but his spirit is as strong as ever. It seems he still has several more ventures to complete!</p>
