<h3>蔣主席接見馬歇爾　會談兩小時並留共午餐</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕蔣主席昨晚返京後，即逕赴軍校官邸休息，未接見任何賓客，但曾延見宋子文·何應欽·陳誠數人，談一小時許。聞四日晨十時三十五分，馬歇爾特使往謁主席，曾會談二小時許，並留共午餐，談話內容未發表，但據接近馬使者稱：今日為主貢返京後，第一次接見馬使，暢談甚久，深信雙方對舉世焦待執行第一次政協決議之接收東北主權問題，恢復全面交通問題，整編統編軍隊問題，加強軍調部執行小組權力問題，必已談及今日為中國家。喻戶曉之端陽佳節，馬使對中國歷史及民俗學研討甚力，故其與主席談話涉及此佳節歷史的意味時，徹露不勝今昔之感。聞主席今日於接見馬使後，並延見政府代表，聽取報告。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕蔣主席返京後，一時和平商談之空氣彌漫都城，但關於如何解決東北問題一事，各方則傳說不一，有謂昨日周恩來與馬使談話時，雙方曾就多種問題交換意見，甚謂有關某一問題，中共對於美方有最後決定權一點，曾加以婉拒，主張一切仍由蔣主席作最後決定，此種論調近日已屢見不鮮，但因其措詞簡單，合義莫明，一般讀者頗興莫明其妙之感。頃據某中立人士吿本報記者云：目前一切問題，必須留待主席決定，誠屬必要，但有一原則務須認淸，即一切有關和平接收東北主權，恢復交通，整編統編軍隊諸問題，均須熱望蔣主席根據國策作最後決定。此一原則認淸後，局勢即可望澄淸，不然縱起蘇張於地下，亦終越說越糊塗，而終於徒勞。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕馬歇爾將軍今晨訪晤蔣主席，自十一時起開始會商，歷時三小時，衆信馬使已向蔣主席直接提出和戰問題。其後馬使即開始與局恩來舉行長時間談話，直至傍晚。若干方面人士相信，和戰問題將在數小時內決定。衆信馬使之秘書和平方案富有彈性，可以適應轉變中之情况。中立方面人士以爲，馬使可以平衡國共雙方之要求。</p>

<h3>國府紀念週　陳總長報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕陳參謀總長誠，四日出席國府紀念週，作軍事報吿，要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）軍隊整編　國軍現有步兵八十九個軍，二百三十九個師，（靑年軍三個軍，八個師在內，共產軍一一五師，一二〇師，一二九師，三個師除外）騎兵二個軍，十三個帥，應於本年三月起至明年二月底止，整編爲步兵三十個軍，（共九十個師）及騎兵十個旅，編餘官兵分別退伍或轉業，以上部隊整編及復員工作，分兩步驟實施，第一步驟—各軍均裁減三分之一，即原三師九團之軍，縮編爲三旅六團之師，原二師六幽之軍，縮編爲二旅四團之師，各獨立師一律編改爲二團內之獨立旅。第二步驟—應照軍事三人小組所簽訂之基本方案實施，但九十個師按規定編制編成後，應逐次編爲三十個軍，每軍轄三師，並照基本方案所規定逐次導入應配置之位置。上述第一步驟之整編工作，並分爲三期實施，第一期—整編隴海沿綫及西北部隊）新疆河西除外）共廿七個軍，六十六個師，自三月開始，至四月底完成。第二期—整編長江流械及長江以南部隊，共卅二個軍九十二師，自五月一日開始，至六月底完成，第三期—自七月一日開始，其計劃另定。俟上述第一步驟整編完成，即繼續實施第二步驟之整編。其辦法如下，各步兵師均按照正式漸制整編步兵爲九十個師，每師兩旅，四團，共一萬四千人，每軍部直屬部隊約六千三百人，各軍師整編開始日期，須由軍調部規定，約每月整編八至九個軍，其編制另定之，華北方面，共計七個軍，須於本年九月一日以前，按規定編制，先編成一個軍，俾與中共部隊在第七個月（即本年九月）統編爲集團軍，其他六個軍，則可稍後分別編成，並指定其中之三個軍與中共部隊編爲集團軍。</p>
<p>（二）設立國防部　中央原有軍事機構，實行改組現已開始，各該機構之原有業務，統交國防部繼續辦理，現國防部已於六月一日正式成立，對於改組軍事機構，蔣主席在還都前曾有三點指示；（一）希望各級將領皆能以國家利益爲前提，依國家自前及將來需要，實非調整軍事機構不可。（二）軍事機構之改組，完全以美國之軍事組織與系統爲根據。（三）限制本年五月底前改組完畢。</p>
<p>國防部之立法精神共有四點：</p>
<p>一爲以政治軍　依據歷次戰爭經騐，以政治軍，對國策之運用，國防之實施，最爲妥善，此種觀念，在英美尤爲普遍，此次軍事機構改組，撤銷與行政分立之軍事委員會，設立國防部，改隸行政院，即屬此意。</p>
<p>二爲還軍於國　還軍於國，乃本黨之一貫政策，此次成立國防部，即爲貫澈此種政策，我國今後即將實行民主立憲，更不可使軍事機構再脫離行政系統而獨立</p>
<p>三爲陸海空軍統一指揮　現代戰爭軍事本身之戰略及戰術，已構成陸海空軍之一體性，且因摩托主宰軍事之結果，戰爭之突發性極大，爲謀應付緊急措施，陸海空軍之軍政軍令，更不可不統一指揮，此次國防機構之改組，即為採取此制。</p>
<p>四爲國防部之組織　係以國家元首在戰事兼任陸海空軍大元帥，故此種組織，無論戰時，平時，均可適用，不致因突發戰事而無所適從。此次改制，具此四種精神實爲樹立百年制度，奠定國家長治久安之基礎。國防部又有兩特點：（一）爲權能劃分，軍事所有之「權」，操於政府，而軍事專門之「能」，則屬於軍部。（二）爲三聯制體系之具體表現，國防部代表政府，有權監督，參謀本部計劃指導，總司令部則負責執行實施，此實充分表現行政三聯制之精神。</p>
<p>原有軍事機構改組爲國防部，其實施辦法，分爲三時期，第一時期，原有機構之業務，未經完成者，仍由原機構繼續負責處理，第二時期，按照新機構編制，重新切實編併，第三時期正式開展新機構之業務，至原有機構之工作人員，除已儘量編人新機構外，尙有編餘人員，將妥爲安置，其詳細辦法與部隊復員安置辦法同。（未完）</p>
<h3>蔣主席關懷　公務員待遇</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕蔣主席返京後，對討論多次迄不決定之調整公務員待遇問題，曾向有關當局垂詢甚詳，聞此案在五日舉行之國防最高委員會議，將作最後決定。據關係方面透露，主席對此案極爲關念，主張作合理調整。</p>
<p>銅圖說明：（上）抵瀋視察之白崇禧將軍，（中）白將軍與歡迎者熊主任式輝等步出機塲（下）白將軍出席熊主任招待會後與本報記者等在瀋合影</p>

<h3>主席對靑年軍　廣播訓詞　（續完）</h3>
<p>生活的訓練，除了要培養秩序及紀律的習慣之外，還有一個目的，就是要養成我們刻苦耐勞的德性。革命事業，原是救人救世的事業，革命者，必須不惜自己的痛苦，來解除他人的痛苦，犧牲自己的幸福，來謀他人的幸福，設能忍受當人所不能忍受的痛苦，担當常人所不能担當的工作，然後纔不愧爲革命的幹部。我全體靑年子弟們，你們只要一研究我們國民革命眾發展的經過，就可以知道我們今日的抗戰勝利之所由來，完全是由刻苦耐勞冒險犯難中奮鬬出來的。我們革命軍在民國十五年的時候，以少數的軍隊和　劣的器械，而能戰勝力量百倍於我們全國各省的軍閥，就是憑了這革命救國的志願，和爲主義爲民族一片犧牲奮鬭的赤忱所獲得的。這不止軍隊的成功如此，個人的成功也是如此，你們試看一般富家子弟，不能刻苦耐勞節儉樸實，而只求享受，只圖逸樂者，到最後，那一個能有結果，由此可知，一個人要成功立業，一定要能刻苦耐勞，冒險犯難，只問工作，不計報酬，尤其是我們靑年的子弟，你們年齡都只在二三十歲之間，幸而能參加了今日革命的隊伍，所以更要以救國救民，救人救世爲天職，以刻苦爲當然，以耐勞爲本份，如果我們不此之圖，而只計報酬，只圖享受，那就一定要爲時代所淘汰，大家都知道，美國，是現在世界上最富强的一個國家，而杜魯門總統最近尙要求他一般國民，束緊肚帶，節省糧食，以為提倡，我國靑年，皆受軍訓，而我們中國如此貧弱的國家，經濟生產的能力如此落後，如果我們一般靑年再不能刻苦耐勞，節儉樸實，怎樣能够嬉水面戈　一介一，　代；有，又如何能生存於現代國際之林。</p>
<p>以上是說明生活的訓練，對於一個人成功立業的重要，現在我還要將我個人的經歷，傳授給我的全體靑年子弟們，我在廿一歲考入保定陸軍學校，第二年就由軍校考送到日本學習陸軍，到了廿四歲，就派到日本野砲兵聯隊，入伍了一年，這一年的中間，所過的完全是士兵生活，極端的單調而嚴肅，紀律的拘束和生活的單調，乾燥無味，使我當時感覺得太不合理了。但是我今天回憶起來，我平生生活之能够簡單，工作之能够有恒，四十年如一日，確是由於這一年士兵生活的訓練所奠立的基礎。我以爲我一生革命的意志和精神，能有今日革命無畏的精神，亦完全是這一年士兵生活的影響，如果我沒有這一年當兵的經歷，不受過那樣士兵的生活，我或許不會有今天這樣革命事業的，所以你們必須寳貴過去這一年的士兵生活和訓練，特別要體察了解，領會，身體力行，如此必能成功一個革命的幹部，綫不辜負全國國同胞及我號召你們來入伍受訓的切望了。</p>
<h3>國軍向拉法推進　長春至吉林間火車恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕國軍進抵哈爾濱近郊與否，消息貧歧，此間今日同時傳出不同之兩種，一謂國軍分三路北上，前鋒已抵哈市近郊三英里，另爲鄭洞國二日在長之談話謂，日來國軍無新進展，永吉東北抵拉法附近，北方則停於松花江南岸，俟以永吉，長春兩地爲中心，肅淸共軍後，再開始第一次向哈城推進，兩者相較，以後者爲可靠，又傳共軍利用地勢，正沿興安嶺構築工事，並使齊齊哈爾要塞化。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春三日電〕長春至吉林火車，四日即可恢復，廖耀湘將軍語記者稱；軍運開始後，客運於最近亦可售票，在吉林方面之國軍，刻向拉法站推進。按拉法站爲拉濱綫重要據點，北岸火車可通達哈爾濱。</p>
<p>〔合業社東北國軍司令部四日電〕社聿明將軍參謀長趙家驤將軍今日透露：共軍於三日前炸斷鐵橋後，刻正圖在哈爾濱南方七十五哩於松花江北岸地帶作堅守哈市之防禦戰。趙家驤年僅卅八，爲國軍中年事最輕之二星將官，記者詢以戰爭曾於何處發生，渠謂：在吉林之東北兩方，並不劇烈，祇係一種後衛掩護戰，目的在遲延我軍前進」。</p>
<h3>軍調臨時小組　視宗平北懷柔</h3>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕軍調部視察安次龐各莊等地歸來之臨時執行小組，昨再出發視察平北懷柔縣屬之麻黃峪一帶，蓋前接報吿有共軍第十三旅蕭文久所部五個團，開到該處構築工事。</p>

<h3>華北各綫共軍活動　戰事已瀕一觸即發險境</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四。電〕確息，共軍在平漢綫北段又大事破壞，曾於琉璃河附近襲擊國軍，但旋被擊退。該處鐵道先後曾被毀壞數公里，現正在搶修，並聞在正太鐵路側面活動之共軍五千餘人，亦在蠶動中。在北寗綫活動之共軍正向唐山急進，並傳唐山市被包圍，同時開灤，蘆台，漢沽，亦紛電吿急，惟香河一帶之共軍，聞已受挫。共軍目的顯在開濼煤礦，但據華北來人談，該處國軍實力，不可輕侮，如共軍輕舉妄動，威脅開濼煤礦，將遭遇嚴重打擊。華北戰事，已瀕一觸即發之險境。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平四日電〕據交通界息，津浦路北段及隴海路東段，仍不時被破壞，津浦路站長及員工一部被共軍扣押，尙未釋放。</p>
<h3>改訂財政收支系統會議　明晨在首都開幕　討論稅收改確立省預算</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕實施改訂財政支系統會議，決於六日晨九時在勵志社舉行，大會由財政部長兪鴻鈞，糧食部長徐堪主持，並聞大會已呈請蔣主席曁朱院長於開幕時出席訓示。此次會議之中心議題，厥爲稅收之改制，亦爲目前財政之重要調整，會議獲得結果後，即將通令全國施行。大會會員定今日起報到，據聞大會預定出席會員一百六十人，爲各省主席，財政廳長，出賦糧食管理處處長，政院直轄市市長，財政局長等，但各省亦有報到列席者，迄今晚止，計報到三十餘人。連同列席人員達四十餘人，計江蘇，浙江，廣東，陝西，松江，嫩江各省主席，田糧處長，財政廳長，綏遠，察哈爾等省財政廳長，各代表業已開始送提案到會。又大會業已擬就重要提案文件，惟尚待批准整理，大會會期三日，以最經濟之時間，迅速進行，期收最高效率。又兪財長定五日下午就該部舉行茶會，招待來京出席大會之會員，聽取各代表意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕聞此次改訂財政收支系統後，省方即可確立省之預算，中央稅收支出營業稅百分之五十，土地稅百分之二十及部份遺產等稅，給予省方。如此縣之財政將入良好情況，來日欠賦徽收一律改為實物。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕聞蔣主將藉各省級行政首長來京，出席實施改訂財政收支系統會議之便，分別召見各省主席，財政廳長，市長，財政局長等，有所垂詢，並予指示。並擬於整軍實行期間，藉各部隊長來京述職之便，召見各將領，聽取軍中近情及有關軍隊整編，敎育，衛生及官兵生活，外傳短期內將舉行重要軍事會議一說，不確。</p>

<p>被告褚民誼，男，年六十四歲，住浙江吳興縣責　鎮。</p>
<p>有聲請人因被告漢奸案，對於江蘇高等法院中華民國卅五年四月廿二日判決聲請復判，本院判決如左：</p>
<p>主文</p>
<p>原判決核准</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>本件被告褚民誼，原任中國國民黨中央執行委員及行政院秘書長，中日　事發生後，避居上少海，民國廿八年夏間，伊戚汪兆銘抵滬與日寇秘密媾和並召開僞國民黨六全大會，時被告即行參加，担任僞中央黨部秘書長，中央執行委員監察委員等職，隨同汪逆奔走於南京，青島之間，與僞「維新」，「臨時」兩政府會商改組問題，迨獲協議，即於次年三月三十日成立僞國民政府於南京，充任僞行政院副院長，僞外交部長，兼主持僞府還都事宜。又於同年五月間，以僞副使名義，偕同陳公博赴日答禮，旋又參與締結中日基本關係條約，允許日寇在蒙疆華北駐兵，並在我國領海內屯駐艦隊及實行經濟提携，同時發表「中日滿」共同宣言，承認「滿洲國」，以破壞我國領土之完整。翌年二月，調任駐日大使，聯絡軸心各國，承認僞政府，九月　　，仍任僞外交部長，至卅二年僞政府對英美宣戰後，又與日寇締結中日同盟條約，並隨汪道前往東京，參加大東亞會議，迭以謬論爲摧毀英美及消滅中央政府之宣傳。卅四年七月，出任僞廣東省長，兼僞廣東保安司令及僞廣州綏靖主任等情，業經被告在偵查中及廣審審判　歷歷供認不諱，原審核與其所撰「參加和運自述」及共犯陳公博，陳　君在另案之供述相符，並以有查獲之僞國民政府任命狀「大東亞會議共同聲明」及在陳公博案內調取之「僞國民政府使節團赴日答禮記」，「僞國民政府政綱之理論與實施」，「中日締約與大東亞戰爭」，「國內新聞貼報簿」等件足資印證，因認其通敵謀叛之逆跡極爲顯著，犯罪情節尤屬重大，爰依懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款，第八條第一項，第九條第一項，刑法第二條第一項前段，第廿八條，第卅七條第一項判處死刑，榹奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必須生活費外，沒收。其認定事實，適用法律，尚無逮誤，聲請復判意旨謂，當抗戰初期，敵寇深入，蘇浙皖各處淪陷，被告爲搶救人民，保全國家元氣，始出而參加組織政府，担任職務，　係和平抗日，與武裝抗日爲分工合作，殊途同歸。至任外交部部長，不過僅擁虛名，所有訂立中日各條約，發表中日滿共同審書及對英美宣戰，被告並未簽字，且利用日本收回各國租界，亦不爲無功等語。本院　聲請人所　各節，在被告變曾有此抗辯，　經原織調查結果，認爲係屬飾詞避就，均不足採，已於判決理由內詳予說明，況查被告歷任中央要職，於敵軍深入，戰事緊急之際，不知協力同心，共禦外侮，竟甘心附逆，背叛中央。據其所供，組織僞政府後如何赴日答禮，參與大東亞會議，如何商議締結中日基本關係條約，中日同盟條約，發表中日滿共同宣言及對英美盟邦宣戰，表示與日寇共同生死，並於九一八的回頭與新認識之演詞內，述及「友邦（指日寇言）極力強化我們國民政府（指僞政府）繼續進行撃滅重慶」，「大東亞就只有重慶一隅還在從事盲目的搞戰，但是因爲英美的個禦完全喪失，所以重慶已成爲甕中之鱉，潰滅僅僅是時間的問題」各情形，其通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之罪證已極明確，茲聲請人復代爲任意狡辯，殊無足採，原判旣無不合，應予依法核准，據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第廿條第一項第一款判決如主文。中華民國卅五年五月廿四日，最高法院刑事第一　，審判長推事　在均，推事李紹言·　　　·　人驥·林尚　·右正本證明　原本無異，書記言李世平，中華民國卅五年五月廿九日。</p>

<h3>留學政策的檢討</h3>
<p>敎育部最近先後公佈自費學考試章程和公費留學辦法，自費留學五月十五日開始報名，公費留學亦於六月一日開始報名，不久即將分別舉行考試。有志深造的青年，自可有出國留學的機會。今日中國青年，在淪陷區者，經過敵僞的毒化敎育凡七八年，其在大後方者，也被戰爭封鎖了七八年，一旦能獲有機會考試出國，換換環境，吸些新空氣，學習性質相近的有用學科，不論對其本人或對於國家社會，都是一件值得慶幸的事。但是大批青年學生出國求學，政府究竟應否有一個統盤的計劃？這是我國整個的留學政策問題。</p>
<p>我國派遣青年學生出國留學，應有五六十年的歷史。這個制度的成敗得失，各人看法不同，誠如所謂「仁者見仁，智者見智」，但無論如何，以中國科學的落後，人才的寥落，要急起直追，建設成功一個現代國家，留學政策終究還值得提倡，數址年中也不可謂留學生對國家毫無貢獻。政制的革新，社會的改造，以及各種新事業的舉辦，多多少少是有留學生的心血生命犧牲在裏面。其所以成效沒有如我們理想的優良者，一半由於留學生回國以後的環境使然，一半則由於辦理的方法不善。至於因留學制度而引起的流弊，那更全屬人爲，決非不可救藥的病症。在清末及北洋時代，根本無飭學政策可言，姑置勿論，到了國民革命軍北伐成功之後，政府對於留學問題，向採嚴格主義，不但對於公費學生，須經過敎育部考試錄取，而且對於自費學生，也夫定須先到敎育部領取留學證書，然後始可辦理出國手續。及至抗戰期間，政府西遷，沿海一帶盡爲敵人封鎖，中外交通阻斷，出國留學在技術上更發生了障礙，有幾年連公費留學考試都停止舉行，自費留學更不必論。其後空運暢通，敎育部始在陪都繼續辦理，對於公費自費留學生，均須經過考試及格，始許出國。披閱敎育部最近公佈的兩種法規，今日的留學政策，可謂一仍舊貫，毫無變動。我們以爲要使留學政策多少更見成效，必得注意下列兩點：</p>
<p>第一，留學政策必須與建國步驟相配合。現在抗戰結束，踏入建國時期，戰後的中國，迎冰龍趕上，百廢待興，除了物力財力而外，尤其需要大批專門人才和實際幹部。而在過去七八年中，我國高等敎育，因受戰爭影響，水凖低落，無可諱言，世界的新知今方一日千里，而中國的學府則尚在遷回復校之中，再加以戰時損失浩大，修復旣非易易，設備更難完善，所謂十年樹木百年樹人，培養人才原非一蹴可幾，爲適應緊急需要計，鼓勵有志青年，出國深造，自不失爲適時之良策。但我們要問：政府對於建國人的工作已否定好了步驟，分好了緩急？已否約略計算過某種事業需要專才若干人，需要高級幹部若干人？已否打算在這些需要人才培植歸國之後，如何容納於事業之中，而不致使他們有「用非所學」，或「懷才不遇」之感？假使今天對於留學生只知道考試，其他仍然漫無計劃，並無配合可言，則現在大批青年出國，將來期滿歸來，未必能「人盡其才」。有棟樑而無柱石，有門窗而無板壁，依然構造不成一間房屋。就國家財政言，是經濟的浪費；對青年學生言，是人才的糟蹋。何況我國學生，一到國外，就如脫缰之馬，誰也不去顧問，爾我各行其是，一盤散沙，形容並不過分。我們看到蘇聯派遺學生出國留學，當局先有通盤籌劃，有組織，有指導，在國外造就的人才，和國內所需要的人才，完全能够配合。難怪他們三次五年計劃，就能把國家翻了一個身。返歡我國，敎部此次公佈自費留學與公費留學的名額與學科，除了對自費留學生加強管制一點而外，實在看不出有什麼整個計劃。但這也不能獨責敎育部，我們先得問問整個政府對今後三年五載的建國工作究竟有否定好計劃與步驟；假使沒有，那叫敎育部怎樣去配合呢？</p>
<p>第二，留學考試必須拔取實學真才。國家假使有了建國計劃，定好需才之多少，原可用各種方法鼓勵青年，按照國家所急需的學科，出國深造，不一定須經過考試。因爲外匯現在已無官價黑市之分，與其讓私人申請外匯濫買洋貨，何如核給外匯鼓勵好學青年的深造。惟旣考試，那就應在考試時注意選拔真才實學。不但親戚朋友的情面不應該賣，就是刻板一律的文憑也何必重視。科目不妨考得嚴，試題不妨定得多，程度不妨提得高，口試不妨認得真，無論誰，報名應考，只要够格，就在够格中間選尤拔萃，不必部他讀過多少年書，那個學校畢業。老實說，今天的大學生，儘有若干畢業的，其程度未必勝於十五年前的高中畢業生，而況無論中外，社會上也儘有好學深思之士，沒有大學畢業或進過大學的。理首自修，學有心得，如果經大學校長或敎授負責介紹推荐，何以不能使之有同樣應考的機會？故就考試制度論考試的效果，與其限制投考學生的資格，不如嚴防主考閱卷者的作弊，因爲做到了後者自可選拔真才，而僅僅注意前者，或反致擯真才於門外。</p>

<h3>貝文斥責蘇聯政策　世界上豈僅蘇爲民主國　採蘇維埃制度實係退步</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞倫敦四日廣播：英外相貝文今在下院發表演說，闡述英國之外交政策，除表示贊同美國所提議之解除德國武裝二十五年條約外，對於蘇聯，亦以溫和之語氣盼其對歐洲問題與英美合作。貝文謂：由於政治思想之不同，締造和平之工作，當極艱困，但渠對於和平前途，絕不悲觀，蘇聯李維諾夫曾謂，和平乃不可分割者，渠絕對贊同此說，歐洲方面若不能獲得蘇聯之合作，決無和平安全可言。巴黎外長會議，將於下週重行舉行，希望蘇方能表示合作，俾歐洲問題，可獲解決。貝文謂英方曾向史達林建議將英蘇友好條約延長五十年，未得要領，深盼仍能做到此點。貝文並就上次巴黎會議談判情形，一一加以報告及檢討。</p>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞倫敦四日廣播：今日英外相貝文在下院發表演說稱：苟吾人不欲全面戰爭，則必須爭取全面和平，爲達到此一日的，各國必須相互瞭解彼此之動機。第二次世界大戰後，局勢　第一次世界大戰後複雜遠甚。蘇聯在戰爭中損失重大，貢獻殊多，戰後亦必須有蘇聯之合作，始能保證歐洲之和平。然蘇聯方面顯有一種傾向，即認爲僅有蘇聯代表工人利益，僅有蘇聯爲民主國家，其他若干國家均有法西斯或親法西斯之嫌疑，彷彿蘇聯之安全，須在全世界每一國家採取蘇維埃制度之後，始得保障，殊不知英國自有其進步途徑。我國於一百五十年前，即開始工業革命，如目前開始採取蘇聯之方式，實非進步而係退步云。</p>
<h3>法選舉結果英美滿意　三國連繋將加強　英報認爲民主已戰勝獨裁　天主敎黨勢力已遍及西歐</h3>
<p>﹝聯合社華盛頓四日電﹞此間外交界今日預料法國此次普選結果，將增強該國對美英兩國之政治及經濟連繋，國務院官員對此，保持緘默，惟共和人民行動黨經此次選舉，已壓倒共產黨一躍而爲法國最強大政黨，美政府當局私下表示頗爲滿意。以一般而論，美國各官員與共和人民行動黨黨魁法外長畢杜爾相交頗善，現畢氏本黨旣佔政黨首席，則於多數問題，必可採取更堅強之立塲。美當局深信凡遇重要問題，與蘇方意見大相逕庭時，畢氏之立塲，當附和美英兩國。至於經濟方面，共和人民行動黨將依照更接近美國所主張之路綫，試圖促進貿易政策，而不致照共產黨及社會黨主張，將法國工業收歸國營。</p>
<p>﹝法國新聞社倫敦三日電﹞「標凖晚報」本日發表社論，檢討法國普選結果，略謂：此次選舉結果，意義重大，不僅對於法國爲然，即對於歐洲亦然。法國已斷然拒絕獨載制度，此際應由人民共和運動黨與社會黨聯合起草憲法，此種憲法當能爲法國全國所接受也。自由黨機關「明星報」亦撰論稱：民主觀念已戰勝無產階級獨裁，一般人久已預料戰後法國將成共產世界，今茲似可證明其見解之錯誤矣。法國國內現有反對真正民主國會之政黨間，共產主義恰如小巫之遇大巫。</p>
<p>﹝路透社倫敦四日電﹞法義兩國選舉之結果，西歐大陸似將成爲保守黨及反共產主義政黨之天下，除西班牙及葡萄牙係由天主敎極權政　所統治外，其餘悉爲民主　選右　天主敎黨之勢力。倫敦某政治觀察家曾謂：著名之「西歐集團」，似已逐漸成爲事實，惟其中心不在社會主義之英國，而在梵蒂岡而已。義大利之選舉根據最近之市政選舉結果觀，天主敎基督民主黨，似可佔得優勢。果爾，則荷蘭·比利時·法國·盧森堡·奧地利·德國南部及義大利均將成爲天主敎政黨之勢力圈。</p>
<h3>義國政制選舉共和派佔優勢</h3>
<p>﹝路透社羅馬四日電﹞義大利今晨宣佈選舉之臨時結果，北部人口稠密之地，傾向共和政體，南部及撒丁　與西西里島則傾向君主政體，國王安伯托之命運，現仍得其平衡，北部人民雖表反對，但尚有農村所投之票亦應計算在內。頃據協理奈尼宣稱：今已計算之票數約百分之十，其結果如次，擁護共和政體者一百五十萬零九千票，選舉制憲議會之票數，今已計算五分之一，其結果如次：基督民主黨二，〇五〇，〇〇〇票，社會黨一，三六五，〇〇〇票，共產黨一，二二九，〇〇〇票。</p>

<p>﹝　聯合社華盛頓三日電﹞蘇聯新任駐美大使諾維柯夫，今日向杜魯門總統呈　國書。杜魯門與諾氏致詞，互相保證促進美蘇兩國關係。總統宣稱：美國對於蘇聯之建議，將予以迅速同情之考慮，促其實現，尚望蘇聯對於美方所建議者，亦與以同樣之者慮。按蘇聯前任駐美大使葛羅來柯現調任聯合國機構安全理事會常任代表，其遺缺即由諾氏繼任。</p>
<h3>范登堡發表演說　號召「人發的和平」　反對強國秘密合作包辦和平　擁護美現行外交政策</h3>
<p>﹝聯合社密契州底德偉三日電﹞參議員范登堡，今日號召「人民的和平」警告此間，反對以強國秘密合作包辦世界和平。范登堡曾偕國務卿貝爾納斯參加巴黎四國外長會議，今日在華盛頓特爲底德律廣播發表演說，謂巴黎會議確定一種美國外交政策，主張「邀請全體參戰國對於吾人共同和平，均有適當之發言權」。開於此點，巴黎會議不失爲一種成功。范登堡並熱切　請蘇聯在和約談判中，出以容忍態度。范氏對於蘇聯堅持在美英蘇法四國基本問題意見未一致前不允召開和平大會一節，表示不安。據稱：蘇聯由是運用一種否決權，致使全部和平機構益見動搖。蘇聯此種權利固在四強以前所訂協定範圍之內，但歷史敎訓吾人，「權利」苟不出以智　與容忍，而單恃權力，或能成爲「錯誤」。范登堡雖爲共和黨員，但稱，在任何政府之下將擁護美國現行外交政策，此項政策實爲對於軸心國任何侵略之最大保障，擴張主義對於將來之和平與安全實爲一種　　。現在與關係各國所訂之停戰條約，不足以結束戰爭局面，　使和約　延不能成立，超　一切理智與安全之限度云。</p>
<h3>史退丁紐斯辭職杜魯門批准</h3>
<p>﹝　聯合社華盛頓三日電﹞聯合國機構美代表史退丁紐斯呈請辭職，今日已由杜魯門總統照准。據稱：今日在白宮晤談時，　因史氏去志甚堅，始予接受。白宮旋發表總統致史氏函，希望共決心所做之事無不順利。史氏係前任國務卿，數月以來，因在聯合國機構中担任比較不重要之角色，頗表不滿，故已早有去志。</p>
<p>﹝法國新聞社華盛頓三日電﹞明日安理會討論西班牙問題時，史退丁紐斯仍當出席參加，直至總統任命繼續代表後始解職。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社紐約四日電﹞美國各方猜測繼史退丁紐斯之任者，當係現任聯合國機構經濟曁社會理事會美代表魏責特，副國務卿艾克遜及前駐蘇大使　維斯，亦有繼任可能。</p>

<h3>侵略·屠殺·破壞秩序　日戰犯罪惡滔天　檢察長當庭宣讀起訴書　國際法庭延期至十三日再開審</h3>
<p>﹝本報東京特派員四日電﹞遠東國際法庭今晨九時三十分開庭，聽取檢察長季楠公開陳述起訴意旨。來日與麥帥商討佔領工作之中國駐日佔領軍司令戰堅將軍亦蒞庭帝聽。季楠宣讀起訴意旨之前，。首席辯護律師清瀨提議謂，日文譯本不全，盼檢察團給以完全之譯本。審判長魏勃不容清瀨繼續往下發言，謂此非合理動議，應即停止。季楠聞言，向辯護欄路作微笑，繼續朗誦起訴書，全文長一萬五千字，措辭動人，指斥各被告破壞民主制度人民自由，對人道不予尊重，擅設所謂新秩序取而代之，彼等屠殺並奴役數千百萬之人民。（以下聯合社電）</p>
<p>結黨營私發動侵略季楠並稱，此次審判並非平常審判，乃爲保持整個世界免被摧毀之文化的戰鬥之一部份。此種破壞之威脅，並非來自自然的辦量，而係業自各個人之周密計謂。此等人結黨營私，似欲使世界在其瘋狂之統治野心下早臨末日。此輩現在犯人席中，每人均分負謀殺與刦掠之責任，此乃日本在遠東與太平洋十八年侵略計劃之一部份。全世界極少數人，此輩被告亦在其內，一手包攬法律，欲以其個人之意志，強制人類服從。彼等係向文明宣戰，自行制造夫則，自行確定各種事件。各被告意欲破壞民主，故與納粹勾結，企圖樹立新秩序。日本侵略主義者曾與希特勒黨徒共同計劃，凖備並反動反對民主的侵略戰爭。各被告曾謀殺及壓制數百萬人，殺戳老人與幼童，甚至消滅整個社會，將條約與協定視同廢紙。此次審判或當爲歷史上重大審判之一，對於此間十一國代表意義重大，各該國政府管轄全球半數以上之居民。</p>
<p>明白揭櫫審判目標　此次審判同時對於其他國家及每一國家之後代人民，亦具同樣重大關係，蓋以此種審判對於世界和平與安全，能發生遠大之影響也。當此開審之初，主持審判者應明白揭示其目標。吾人之廣大目的，在於實行法治，其特別目標則在致其全力，以防止侵略戰之禍害。被告東條英機等一行，在嚴密監視之下，坐於前陸軍省大厦改作之法庭中，聽取控訴狀譯文·季楠續稱，此輩之陰謀，乃在去配及控制東亞，最後及於全世界。季楠於是列舉各犯罪狀，謂發動謀殺，與正義及法律決不相符。謀殺一百萬人，其罪不亞於謀殺一個人。宣誓擁護一國之法律與制度，不能免於受懲處，不能承認犧牲數百萬人生命之戰爭諉爲「事變」，亦不能承認此輩個人解釋之推行國策爲正當。各被告應知其所策劃之戰爭，結果惟有毀滅整個人類生命。若謂處罰使文明瀕於滅絕之個人爲不法，則司法本身即成笑柄。被告等曾辯稱即使證明其參加陰謀，促成公開或非公開之侵略戰，世界上亦無任何權力可繩之以法。</p>
<p>援引法理證明犯罪　季楠控告被告邪惡八名策劃並發動對聯合國之戰爭，同時日本侵略滿洲以來，數百次遠法舉動亦同樣有罪。季楠對於合法資格之指資爲　之辯護謂，戰勝國有權將戰敗國日本之軍閥及政客訴諸於法。此次審判非欲出以報復，乃爲防止侵略戰之禍害。季楠並援引法理根據，證明十一聯合國有特別權力檢舉戰爭犯，並請依照國際公法，侵略戰實爲犯罪，現在如此，以前亦然。爲欲獲此結論，應有兩種事實爲根據：第一，須有關於此事之國際公法存在；第二，依照此項國際法，此事應爲犯罪。確定此項事實，乃爲本法庭及此間確定東軍事法庭，承認並依法宣布此兩原則，實爲國際公海之一完整部份，此在歷史上實爲創舉。</p>
<p>國際法庭本日退庭後，將延期本月十三日再行開審。</p>

<h3>德僑遺歸時間問題技術人員或可暫留</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞留滬德僑如何遺送回國，頗爲中外各方注意。頃據外交部某高級人員告記者，以原則上言，我國與德國現仍處於戰時狀態，德僑自應視爲敵僑，而全體遺送歸國。乃德僑於被列入應撤退之名單後，往往提出名種理由，要求滯留我國，殊不知提出理由與證明是非，乃法律問題，而今日之撤退敵僑，乃政治問題，故彼等即提出種種理由與證據，我國政府並無加以考慮之必要。惟我國素主寬大，且亦欲保留一部技術人員，助我建設，故所擬撤退各單，已呈部細加考核，然後加以決定。此項名單包括德僑千餘人，惟撤退日期撤退說，該發言人正式加以否認。又市政府德僑管理委員會息：德僑撤退回國之名單，係由外交部決定，該委員會僅負執行責任。該會前主任委員楊志雄已辭戰，新任主委沈乃正，已於六月一日親事。</p>

<h3>英商洋行　背信　詐欺　中元輪局受損害　已向地院提起訴訟</h3>
<p>民營中元輪船局，其法定代理人高辛木，於卅四年十一月廿八日向英商　賜洋行（Mollers　Co．）訂購三千八百噸海輪一艘，擬用以代替過去日本勢力所及之航運，行駛沿海南洋印度一帶，當時訂明購價七萬五千金鎊，（約合國幣六萬萬元有餘），先付定金一萬五千金鎊，交船時再付三萬七千金鎊，餘款於交船後一個月內全數付清，中元方面當即依約先付定金一萬五千金鎊。迄同年十二月十日，接餋賜洋行通知，謂該輪業已抵滬，囑即凖備接收手續，並索付二期貨款三萬七千金鎊，詎該洋行竟不守信約，於貨款收到後，藉口英國戰時運輸管理當局未予應　，由英國戰時運輸局出面運貨，獲利甚豐，中元雖庭向交涉，奈對方多方推諉，終不履行契約，雙方遂於今年三月八日解約，而中元公司所蒙損失至爲重大（蓋輪上全部職員如船長水手等，皆已聘定，開支爲數可觀），乃要求對方賠償損失費九萬萬元，惟對方仍不予置理，中元仍向上海地方法院提起訴訟，請由律師潘仁希魏文達，盧榮幹等共同辦理此案。地院認爲該案涉及中英國際關係，故頗爲重視，不日即將開庭審理，聞中元方面所繳訴訟費用亦達一千一百餘萬元之鉅，實爲上海地方法院於勝利後受理之第一鉅案。值茲收回航權，發展民航事業，高唱入雲之際，我國航商遭此淩侮，殊堪痛恨，聞航業界對此，權爲關懷，將羣起聲援。</p>

<h3>今後的中學圖畫課程標準</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>上月間，筆者在本報發表「評小學圖畫課程標準」一文的時候，恰巧敎育部國民敎育司長顧蔭亭先生因公蒞滬，曾與筆者談話，並表示他相當接受我所提出的一些淺見。</p>
<p>繼續小學敎育的，是中學敎育，這次的「小學圖畫課程標準」，旣然修改得並不如何合符理想，那麽中學的圖畫課程標準，最近修改以後的情形是怎樣呢？實在有提出的必要。</p>
<p>「初高級中學圖畫課程標準」，於廿五年六月由敎育部正式頒行，到廿七年八月，鑒於藝術敎育可以激發抗戰情緒，遂明令將敎學時間增加，初中每周爲二小時，高中每周爲一小時。廿九年十二月，把它修正公布，假使把新舊對照一下，祗有敎學時間是正式定爲初中二小時，高中一小時，敎材大綱，似較未修正時具體，並多了國畫的白描與水墨兩法敎學的重視，前者，是把廿七年的明令正式實施，後者，則又是適應了內地貧乏的物質環境而已。所以筆者敢說：「初高級中學圖畫課程標準」，實在是未曾根本的加以修訂　。</p>
<p>當然，在建國的進行中，課程標準又有修正的必要，而「圖畫科」方面，到底應該怎樣來改訂？實是一個必要解決的問題。　首先，應該明白，初中是小學的繼續，高中是大學的準備，那麽，小學「圖畫科」要恢復「美術科」，而且主要的目標旣是忽略技術訓練，重視生活美化，初中便不妨也改爲「美術科」，利用美術的欣賞發表與研究充實生活美化的要求。高中，固然一般可以繼續初中要求，但又應該注意美術天才的準備專門訓練的指導，即升入美術專科學校的準備指導，假使初中也有類似的學生發現，則宜指導升入五年制的美專作專門訓練，換言之，初中的後一年及高中，可能傾向美術技術的訓練，高中的科目名稱，也可改爲「美術」。</p>
<p>其次，中學生的智力體力，都比小學生高强，因之，中學美術的實際應用的敎學，更其可以加重，即不妨除欣賞，發表，硏究的作業之外，不妨具體地增加運用一項　　，如：指導參與社會各種病態術活動，指導應徵各種美術工作，指導閱讀美術書報等等。</p>
<p>最後，中學課程標準，在形式上，應採用小學課程標準一致的體例，以便敎學者的實施。</p>

<h3>純廬曲敘</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>殷菊儂女士眞會選擇地方，四月廿八日這天，虹社第二次崑曲同期，她選中了海格路的周家在園，也就是純廬。這地方眞不錯，沿着樹叢的小徑進去，是一座大　，我們就在這廳上舉行曲會。我放下「舖蓋」（曲譜也），就趁便到附近遊覽，經過曲折的欄杆和小橋，望見船廳。杜鵑花開得很盛。時已暮春，再不來玩賞，恐怕杜鵑花要謝了。我向希同說：「我們還是一邊走着，一邊唱着，讓笛師跟着我們，像童話裏「花衣吹笛人」那樣，那該是多末的有趣呵！春香不必憑空的指點，大自然就做了我們的佈景。她說到「這是荼　架」，就可以指着荼　架；說到「這是杜鵑花」，就可以指着杜鵑花；雖沒有靑山，却也有假山呢！」但她們還不至於這樣地灑脫，多少帶一點拘謹，終於還是由張元和允和姊妹，股菊儂，沈琢如，汪一鶼，方英達六位女士在廳堂裏合唱「遊園」作爲開塲。</p>
<p>很凑巧，復旦大學金通尹和他的侄女金成玠也與許多平湖同鄕來此聚餐。其中葛苴吉是賡春曲社的曲友。在沈琢如唱過「驚夢」以後，便臨時拉苴吉來唱「定情賜盒」中的唐明皇，由崑曲裏的「甘草」朱堯文來配楊貴妃。接着唱「小宴驚變」的是英達，一　和沈恒一，唱過就舉行「辟克匿克」了。</p>
<p>我們帶了牛肉，烤麩，沙了魚，果醬，麵包，牛茶，檸檬茶和菠羅蜜，再由平湖同鄉捐了一些酒和拚盆，大家圍着長桌站着吃，別有風味。趁着這休息時間，我又在純廬遊了一周，這一次是向深處前進。剛剛新雨以後空氣格外新鮮。我踏着皮鞋小心地走過了石橋，上了假山，差一點沒有被足下的蒼苔滑倒。我望歡中國式的花園，佔地不多，却極爲曲折。我探幽尋勝，一直從小徑直登山頂，方纔滿意地循着原路回來。</p>
<p>午後塲面未到，便由顧志成　笛，內嫂蔡漱六與我合唱「掃花」。下面是股菊儂與我內人希同的「亭會」。這時客人愈來愈多了。預定允和的「寄　」，姚季琅的「勸妝」，都慷慨的不唱，把時間留出來儘量讓社外的客人唱。穆藕初的小姐怡如，許久不聽地唱曲了，請地唱了一齣「玩　」。王巨川與吳濟川（兩川）唱過了「琴挑」以後，便是柳　風小姐的「盤夫」，由漱六搭配。又有周夢軒的「喬醋」，由元和搭配。蔡令暉小姐的「夜奔」以後，便是預定的　一，琢如，堯文和彭志敏的「斷橋」。大軸戲是從杭州來的老曲家曹仲陶的「絮閣」。他是兪要　的弟子，唱腔多盪音，頗像西洋樂歌的唱法。便饒這樣，還是有許多客人不曾唱，如王寳璆，潘方仁，朱錫貞，汝憶琴等女士，趙曾和，柳芸湄，朱鼎彝，毛廉伯等先生，都不曾得着歌唱的機會，眞是非常抱歉。</p>
<p>這一天可說是虹社的盛會。我們基本社員現在上海的只有十五位，想不到僅只簽名的人就已經有了五十一位。笛王許百遒也替我們　笛。還有兩位美國人—馬夏爾和摩爾的光降。再加上平湖同鄉廿人以及大同大學學生數十人，至少可以聽我們唱曲的，廳內廳外（有坐在石櫈上的，有在隔河的）總在一百人以上，這一百人的集會事前都不曾通知，甚至不相識，他們旣逛進花園，又聽到平時不大能聽到的崑曲，也可以說是一種緣。我們都很高興，都說殷菊儂女士地方選得好。</p>
<h3>外國電影大量來滬之危機</h3>
<p>— 仲</p>
<p>上海的電影院一共有四十餘家，現在差不多全部演外國電影，每天外商影片公司的收入，約計有國幣四五千萬之數，每月約計十五萬萬强。這筆驚人的財富源源不斷的向外國流出去，眞是多麽可怕呀！不過這十五萬萬是單就上海一地而言，加上其他大都市，如南京北平天津漢口廣州重慶等等的電影院所給與外國片商的經濟漏洞，至少是二十萬萬元以上；換句話說，全國爲外商影片所流出的金錢，的有三四十萬萬元之數。你們試想，中國的經濟情况、在八年戰爭之後，已經　　遍地，民不聊生，枯竭到了極點，而勝利之後，反比戰爭時更多的金錢流往外國，那得不叫我們的國幣繼續加速度的通貨膨脹，物價騰貴，物資枯竭，投機充斥，貧富懸殊。雖然我們不能把中國最近的經濟恐惶歸罪於外國電影的大量輸入，但這一個極大的漏洞，我們不能不趕快設法把牠塡塞起來。</p>
<p>塡塞的方法可分積極的與消極的兩種：積極的我們應該趕快攝製中國國產電影。這趕快攝製中國國產電影的呼聲已經說了有半年多了，但攝成的電影還沒有一張；這原因很多：一是人事問題，各攝影塲的分配問題至今沒有完全解決，因此製片無從開始；二是技術問題，機器設備因戰爭關係都已練舊不堪應用，需要趕快到外國去添置新的，但經濟和時間都有問題，因此延攔至今，一無解決辦法。我希望各廠塲早些發還，不必再你搶我奪。我希望影片公司早些派人到外國去購買機器及一切設備，不要再猶疑躊躇。趕快攝製影片是件搶救的工作，我們應該棄除私人的利害而爲國家經濟前途作犧牲一切的努力。有關當局應該盡督導之責，大公無私的催促他們。</p>
<p>消極一方面應該嚴厲取締外國的無聊影片，不發執照。每月入口的影片最多只限幾部。影片的關稅增加。影片公司的拆廠成數要减低，這一點需要各電影院的負責人聯合起來，會同政府向外國片商作嚴重交涉，我們情願以不演外國電影來作最後的武器。</p>
<p>不管是積極的或是消極的，我們都應該抱最大的，預備決心作最大的犧牲，勇敢地向前做去，不要再畏頭畏尾，進進退退，躊躇不決，坐失時機。大家如果肯把公衆的利益放在前面，把私人的意氣放在後面，什麽問題都可以解決，什麽事情都有成功的辦法了。</p>
<h3>山城之戀</h3>
<p>— 克諦</p>
<p>我以迷離的追憶和炙熱的懷念編織成情感的花籃，當着歌頌勝利的春日，把它安放在日曆底面前，從冥想中計算着別難的日子，那縹渺的零星的夢影，會驀地裏在腦海中縈迴而激盪起來。</p>
<p>首先躍入我底記憶裏的是那被揚子江和嘉陵江夾繞着的山城，雖然她儘多着崎嶇的道路和破碎支難的房屋；雖然她够不上有現代都市底繁榮的外表和一切不可抵制的蠱惑；然而到現在我仍然常常熱烈地惦念着她！因爲她曾經遭受過不可磨滅的苦難，我却在她底苦難裏會度過艱辛的日子；她曾從毁滅裏不屈地再生，我却在她底再生裏會鍛鍊成堅强的意志；她曾孕育着抗戰到底的決心，我却從她底決心裏今天在曾經失去的土地上親眼看到光榮的勝利！</p>
<p>除了這些，何况還曾經凝集過一些珍貴的生活底史蹟和友誼底溫情呢？</p>
<p>記得：有好幾回趁着落日的黃昏，從兩路口爬上幾百層的石級，再沿着揚着飛沙的公路向前走去，遨遊於雄偉的復興關（昔稱浮圖關爲中央訓練團所在地）下；又循着千迴百轉的山路走下，徘徊在嘉陵江畔：聽船夫們拉縴時傳來的洪亮的歌聲，一聲聲劃破了靜謐的長空；我曾在那兒重溫過童年的嬉戲，用熱情使年光倒流，變成穉氣揚溢的孩子，和遊伴們在沙灘上追逐着，拋擲着橢圓形的鵝蛋石子爲戲。還有南紀門外南區公園裏的小坐，遙望南岸底搖曳得像繁星閃耀似的燈火；凱旋橋上底俯眺，看行人爬上矗立的石級如上艱危的靑天………</p>
<p>在苦難的日子裏，越覺得友情的可貴而懂得利用它，願意珍重它，尤其是年靑的伙伴們，在流浪煎熬和死亡威脅的種種不安定的生活之中，更容易打通心的河流，而激起共鳴來。因此：在昏黃的三角桐油燈底光亮和複雜而陌生的面孔相映之下的茶室裏，常常圍聚着方桌吃着沱茶，而被海闊天空的豪談弄得神采飛揚，笑聲不絕地忘記了苦痛和憂傷。最難忘的，却是有一年的舊曆除夕，幾個無家可歸的年靑人，團聚在會仙橋底一家旅館裏，凑集着大家各自賺來的錢，換來一頓豐富的茶點，用濃黑色而熱騰騰的咖啡代替了淸茗，暢飲談笑直到天亮，第二天元旦的早晨，踏着在山城不容易見到的一層潔白的雪，數着脚印各自踏上了歸途。熱情不但驅走了疲倦，而且更感覺到生命的可貴，在迷濛惺忪之中，竟忘郤了幾年來在山城所過的是一串被戰爭底黑手所折磨和播弄的歲月！</p>
<p>曾經眷戀過數載的山城，如今隨着勝利而遠離了，誰又能確定那重逢的日子在何年何月？然而我忘不了那曾經踏過的一片雖然崎嶇而播散着芳香的泥土，忘不了那揚子江底混濁和嘉陵江底淸澄相照映之下的地方，在它上面我曾以笑與淚綴飾過自己生命底旅程，首先我願遙寄以誠摯的思戀之情，願她別來無恙！</p>

<h3>草莓</h3>
<p>— 楊</p>
<p>有一年，我曾經　好一畦地，豫備極草莓，結果却找不到秘枝：也有一年，我辛辛苦苦的把它栽種好了，却一點也收穫不到什麽，除了看到幾　枯焦瘦弱的小葉。</p>
<p>低是，自私是人類的天性。因爲這樣，更增加了對它的愛好。雖然是論色，論香，論味，都沒有什麽特點。每年，草莓季節，便不禁總要買上幾顆。</p>
<p>每讀西文的小說書，很多是關於草莓　的記載，更增加了不少的欣羨。我們買上幾顆草莓，總得上水果舖，不像他們能在野外任意摘取，不令人渴慕嗎。</p>
<p>不過，因爲這樣一來，它的身份也高貴了。假使我們也遍地都是，怕也不見得那麽的名貴和珍視吧！</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（四五）</h3>
<p>— 趙青閣</p>
<p>墨太太看見張弦一到，便連忙溜開去。這是張弦事先訂的規矩，在敎戲的時候，不許閒人來</p>
<p>張弦喚麗華麗雲到面前，一個人給了一本戲齣。麗華接了站到一邊去。麗雲瞪着小眼看了看，很興緻地抵聲念着：</p>
<p>『全本提放曹，』</p>
<p>『怎麼？你沒念過書嗎？小雲！』張弦詫異地張大了眼問。然後又指着戲齣更正地說：『道不是「提」字是「捉」字！』</p>
<p>『我只認得幾個字，』麗雲很坦率地回答。</p>
<p>『你呢？小華！』張弦轉臉又問麗華。</p>
<p>華翻了幾頁戲　，點點頭，沒作聲。</p>
<p>『那麽，好！你就先去看這上面我用紅筆圈過的字。有不認得的，來問我，我再吿訴你。』張弦說罷，悄悄瞟了麗華一眼。心裏想：這孩子脾氣果然不小。回頭再向麗雲說：『你旣然不識字，就跟着我念罷，但是你得用心地牢牢記住，趕明見好背給我聽。背不會，我可要打人的。』</p>
<p>麗雲應了一聲。</p>
<p>張弦便先敎麗雲，從白口到唱，他拿腔作勢地敎，一邊用手指在桌子上敲着板眼。他讓麗雲學的是「捉放曹」中陳宮的戲。據說，開始學老生戲，都是從「捉放曹一學起，因為此曾容易。但是　雲確不够聰明，無論是白口，或唱；每一句總要敎上三四遍，才能學得稍稍有點兒像。這不僅難爲了麗雲，也難爲了張弦。後來張弦不耐煩了，只好停止在一個小段落上，叫麗雲自已去練習，再來敎麗華。</p>
<p>麗華把那本戲齣已經看了一半。這是一本「玉堂春」，她雖然也有些字不認識，但她却對於這上面的故事發生了興趣。她並不依照張弦的指示，只看那紅筆圈過的字，就是那些沒有圈過的字，趣也都看過了。</p>
<p>「小華，你有不認得的字嗎？」張弦站起來伸了伸懶腰，喝了口水，然後拉過麗華說。</p>
<p>「沒有。」　華莊重地揮脫張弦的手回答他。</p>
<p>張弦又碰了個釗子。訕訕地坐下去，竊自敬佩地說：「到底出身好，小小年耙，便這麽懂禮貌。」</p>
<p>「那麽，你就也像小雲剛才那樣，我說一句，你說一句；我唱一聲，你也唱一聲；要跟着我一腔一調，一板一眼地學。學的時候必須用心地仔細聽着我怎麼樣說；你就怎麽樣說；我怎麽樣唱；你也就怎麽樣唱。完了，明天你再從頭背一遍，像我今天敎你的一模一樣，錯了便得受罰。」張弦帶着幾分威脅地說。想着：如果麗華不會，就可以用懲罰來治服她的掘强了。</p>
<p>起初，麗華無論如何也開不了　。她看着張弦那種怪聲怪相，旣討厭；又憎惡；任張弦說了再說；唱了再唱；她總不肯跟着學。急得張弦叫起來。</p>
<p>「我的小姐！你可不可以開開金口呀？」</p>
<p>麗華終於沒辦法頑抗下去，只好羞答答低聲開口了。這一開口，第一聲便讓張弦吃了一驚，不但是學得像，而且是好到宛如一個有經驗的人。腔調嚮亮圓韵，口齒淸楚，流利；比起麗雲來，眞有天淵之別。</p>
<p>「苦哇！」麗華哀惋悽絕地顫聲呼號之後，接着便「喂，呀……」地哭起來了！</p>
<p>這呼號正是麗華心理所要叫出的哀音；這哭，也正是她所要發洩的悲忱！她毫不驕揉地叫得很自然，哭得更自然！她忘了這是戲，她忘了她是以蘇三的身份在呼號，哭！她只覺得她現在表現的是她自己，這時的她，恰有着滿腹的苦衷；滿懷的委屈；所以她呼號；她哭；她把戲和人生混合了，她認眞地流下眼淚！</p>
<p>「小華，這是戲！用不着「替古人祖憂」。「張弦拍拍麗華說。他誤會了麗華是被戲所感動。「現在，再跟着我學唱。」說罷，他便裝着喉嚨低聲唱了起來。唱完，他吿訴麗華：「這叫做二簧搖板，記住！這是蘇三出塲以後的第一段唱詞兒。」</p>
<p>麗華沒有言語，機械地跟着張弦一句句學下去。雖然不似剛才那麽自然，但這昔調悲切的氣氛，還能配合她此刻的情緒，因此唱來依舊動聽。她差不多每一句沒有讓張弦敎過第二遍。特別是到了白口的地方，張弦的咬字還不及她淸楚。因爲她有一口純粹的北京音，淸脆嬌柔。加之她識字的原故，學起來格外方便。</p>
<p>張弦又敎了麗華一段反二簧慢板，算是順利地完成了這第一天的課程。最後吿訴她下午學身段的時候，還得背誦剛才學過的唱詞和白口，因爲身段是要配合這唱詞和白口的。然後張弦又把麗雲叫過來。問她：</p>
<p>「小雲，你這會子練習熟了沒有？」</p>
<p>麗雲沒有回答，因爲事實上她剛才只顧去注意麗華了，根本就忘了練習自己的。她對于自己所學過的唱洞和白口，印象已經很模糊了，于是她這時非常窘迫。</p>
<p>張弦不得已，只好又從頭到尾敎了麗雲一遍。最後警吿她說：</p>
<p>「明天如果還是不會，就要挨打了！」</p>
<p>魔雲鼓起小眼睛「　」了一聲。心裏十分地失望：她原以爲學戲是好玩兒，哪知道這樣的艱難。而且張弦動不動要「打」，這更使她惶恐的很，她想不學了吧，又怕翁二太太不許，少不得只有立志用用心。可是道麼一來，她運玩別的時間都沒有了，因此不免惱起來。</p>
<p>到了下半天，石玉樓開始敎他們練身段。這對于麗雲還比較有興趣些，她就喜歡動手動脚，蹦蹦跳跳的。但是，爲了她動得太厲害了，唱詞和白口還不熟，因此二者不能够合拍，把個石玉樓弄得啼笑皆非！只好胡亂敎了一番。</p>
<p>輪到麗華的時候，照樣起初羞于舉手抬脚的。給逼得沒辦法了，便依着石玉樓有節奏地一步不亂地動作起來。爲了她聰明，學的快，石玉樓便也敎得起勁些，認眞些。</p>
<p>之後，麗華和麗雲就每天如此這般地學着，練着。不到半個月工夫，麗華的全本「玉堂春」都會了，可是麗雲的全本「捉放曹」才只會了三分之一。平時麗華還帮助麗雲敎給她認識那些唱詞和白口的字。但無奈麗雲的天資所限，永遠沒法趕上麗華的速度。因此，她便常常的挨手板受罰。麗華也挨過，那是爲了她懶怠開口的時候，或則是她厭煩張弦故意不聽話的時候，曾被張弦打過幾次。</p>

<h3>染料市面參差　元色脚地殊堅挺　廠家定貨不踴躍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕染料市面，近來似見平靜，德孚洋行續有派貨，陰丹士林及直接染料，派數尙屬不少，硫化元則甚緊，最近TBO元間有派出，恆信洋行近一二月來，不接定貨，其以前所接之定貨，陸續有到，硫化元亦有少數交貨，故元色市面，近日由堅轉平，其美貨六九三元，五月初旬爲九十萬元，中旬曾步漲至一百萬出關，近復回至一百萬元，開染廠納胃尙豐，似有看好之望，TBO元漲勢較烈，其原因當由於此牌冷落已久，近則垂靑者忽多，故德孚有派貨，而價反上漲，目下仍站在八十三五萬之問，以視中旬，約漲起十五萬元矣，NLA元旬日來以貨色幾成斷檔，市上無做開者，中旬曾喊至一百十二萬，此貨牌面甚好，自六九三元美貨多成市，似見遜色，然廠家終願加價收買也，至TBO元身骨尙可，惜係靑光，銷路終較狹，且開德孚存底亦已不多，就大勢看來，元色市面，脚地似屬堅挺也，保險粉自協和美和等洋行定貨到埠，頗至疲象，五月初之爲二十萬元者目下已跌至十五六萬元，陰丹士林及保晒霖同馬不退色染料，去年年底曾超過二千萬元，今則九百萬元尙鮮受主，其原因並非出於德孚之多派，而實由於美貨保晒霖之源源到埠，此種美貨出於其經售行家之恒信者尙少，而由於勝利前內地定戶定貨之轉售者却甚多，此種定貨其匯價之結購遠較目下爲便宜，宜其可以薄利多銷矣，照此種情勢，不退色藍似難看好，染廠在最近二三月中，染料去路不可謂爲無起色，終以怯於洋貨跌價，不敢多進，更不敢囤積，故除硫化元等少數大路貨，洋行不肯繼續接受定貨者外，看疲要屬普遍之心理，故各貨一聞進口貨到埠之訊，必然看跌，不退藍，保險粉及燒碱，皆其著例也，惟低檔而旺銷者可轉眼復趨上漲，則硫化元亦其一也，目下染廠之自做賣貨奢，多係淺色貨，代染廠家仍集中於元色藍色谷門，廠家之開工者雖較多，而銷路却無甚發展，滬杭路蠶汛減色，納胃平平，津帮以物價不合算，有停止採辦之象，漢帮去路亦屬呆滯，前途未可樂觀，聞有不少廠家，擬減少工作，節省開支，以渡過此難關云。</p>

<h3>第三次大戰勝利誰屬</h3>
<p>— 佐溪譯述</p>
<p>從「第二次世界大戰」，很容易聯想到「第三次世界大戰」，從最近國際局勢的演變，更使人顧慮到「第三次世界大戰」的來臨。的確，近來很多人談到這一件事情。英國工黨機關報最近登載一篇社論，說第三次世界大戰已經不復是空談，而有演變成事實的可能性。它說蘇聯對於英美懷着極大的猜疑，這種猜疑照目前的速度進展下去，很快就可以達到爆發點，而一旦爆發以後，頓時可把我們的世界夷爲平地。</p>
<p>在另一方面，美國的「國際文摘」七月號裏登載着却爾斯·本斯（Charles　Burns）的一篇動人的文章，題爲「第三次世界大戰誰獲優勝」？</p>
<p>開頭他先不了一句斷語說：第三次世界大戰的戰勝國不會是推行民主政治的美國；換句話說，除非美國先行放棄民主政治而改採類似希特勒的軍事獨裁制，它在未來的戰爭中一定是失敗的。因爲在原子炸彈戰爭中，誰先發制人，誰就取得勝利。這種行動祇有　武國家纔能出此，民主政體的美國是不可能的。</p>
<p>如果今日列强間的爭端不能循政治途徑解次而必須以千戈相向，那麽雙方對壘的陣容當是這樣的：美國對蘇聯—其餘的國家各就其利害關係加入任何一方。</p>
<p>未來的衝突如果是原子戰爭，戰勝國和戰敗國是難以區分的，正如一堆石子和另一堆石子不能加以區分一樣。</p>
<p>未來戰爭的景象大槪是這樣的：在華氏二萬一千二百萬度的高溫下，整個城市鎔化成三和土，玻璃和鋼鐵的混合物。工廠全部崩潰，人和機器變成巨塊煙雲中的點點火星。一顆炸彈爆裂之下，數十萬以至數百萬的人畜同時死亡。離開爆炸地點幾哩以外的人們，今天雖不死，也許明天便不能生。他們的皮膚上日後會發現奇怪的灼傷，是無法治愈的，因爲病者尙感受其他放射性的影響：瀉血，舌痛，出血而無傷痕，毛髮脫落，牙齒動搖，拔之即去，白血球崩潰，不能抵禦病菌。科學家對於第三次世界大戰怎樣說法呢？</p>
<p>曾獲諾貝爾獎金的鄔曾博士說：「將來事不可說。事實上，未來的歷史往往不能持久，我們的技術戰爭可怕萬分，我們苟從事此種戰爭，必無噍類」。他又說：我們的結論是：在敵方能够自由選擇投擲原子炸彈的方法時，對於原子炸彈的爆發，沒有一種有效的防禦方法。」軍事專家怎樣說法呢？</p>
<p>陸軍大將馬歇爾完全承認科學家的最悲觀的論調。他在給總統的最後報吿中斬釘截鐵地說：「第三次世界大戰的爆發有似迅雷的襲擊，」並且預言這種襲擊是從遠處用速度超過聲音的火箭施行轟擊。他提出警吿說，這種迅雷不及掩耳的攻擊，使閒豫和平的美國來不及準備作戰。他認爲美國如欲克敵制勝，非建立堅强的要塞和能够立時作戰的平時受訓陸軍四百萬人不可。</p>
<p>在理論上，也許美國可能成爲唯一應付第三次世界大戰的國家：美國可能把全國改成武裝的營壘，一切島嶼成爲外圍要塞。美國可能便間牒潛入世界各國的　　　和軍械局。但是這一切，在民主的國會中都是難以通過的。美開祇採用軍事獨裁制以後，上述種種可能性纔有實現的希望。</p>
<p>除此以外，美國欲防止第三次大戰，必須遵循如下的途徑：用拖延的辦法來防止未來大戰的爆發，選舉有促進世界和平和贊助聯合國機構的決心的人民做國會議員。如果能够把世界大戰延　十年或二十年，那麽，國際合作一定能够更進一步，或許能產生比聯合國機構更高明的國際組織。</p>
<p>總之，人類必須放下屠刀，立地成佛，吾則只有趨於滅亡的一途？</p>
<h3>雷達與月球</h3>
<p>— D·達埃茲著納節譯</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰由，「雷達」曾盡極重要的作用，戰功僅次於「原子炸彈」。軍艦在黑夜或濃霧中駛行，可以用雷達在許多英里之外探知敵艦的行蹤，然後發砲轟擊，差不多可以百發百中。此外還可以運用雷達，探測敵機和海岸設防情形。至於雷達使用的原理，就是先向太空放出雷達電波，電波向前推進，遭遇了障礙，就會折回來，在記振器上發生波動的記錄，一個受過特殊訓練的人就可從上面看出敵方的動靜，立刻採取應付的措置，而致敵於死命。雷達，加速了聯合國的勝利。</p>
<p>雷達在戰時的用處固然很大，在和平時代的用處一定會更大，簡直是前途無量。譬如最近用雷達探測月球已經成功，成爲人類更進一步瞭解月球以至向月球探險的先聲。一九四六年一月十日，美國新澤西州貝爾瑪的陸軍航空站，在月白多風之夜，向月球放出雷達電波。地球和月球之間的距離是二十三萬八千英里，電波以每秒十八萬六千英里的速度（等於光速）向前推進，再折返地球，所費時間爲二·四秒，當時記振器中發出輕輕的營營聲，黑色的記振板上就起了白色的波紋，從這些一波紋中，就可以推知月球上的地形稱成情形。</p>
<p>人類對於探測月球的嘗試，這一次已經不是第一次。先前曾有人主張用探照燈把極强烈的光射到月球上面，再用精製的望遠鏡實行觀察，結果沒有成功。其後又有人主張用無綫電波放射到月球去，但是在地球上空三十英里的地方，有日光所造成的電離子層，無綫電波無法穿過它，所以一到三十英里的地方就折回來，而月球離開地球有二十三萬八千里之遠呢！謝謝雷達的發明，這些困難都已經克復了。</p>
<p>人類架火箭到月球去探險的嘗試，已經從空想接近實現的地步，而雷達探測月球的成功，可以說是冒險家的福音。</p>
<h3>歐洲政治的轉變</h3>
<p>— 史丹萊赫著　嘉納編譯</p>
<p>一九四五年七月五日，歐洲政治上發生了一個影響深遠的重大事件，是德國崩潰麽？是日本投降麽。大家都知道不是的。假如讀者急於要知道這個重大事件究童是什麼，我可以直截爽快地說。英國勞工黨競選獲勝。</p>
<p>在勞工黨上台保守黨下野英國政治上忙着送往迎來的時候，一般人往往有一種錯覺，以爲英國從此要左傾了，英蘇關係必然會比保守黨執政時代更趨密切，因爲勞工黨所崇尙的是社會主義，社會主義豈不就是共產主義的同胞弟兄麼？這種說法，似是而非，甚至於適得其反，所以我敢說：這是一種錯覺。</p>
<p>以下是美國作家史登萊，哈埃（Stanley　High）對於這個問題所表示的意見，該文的題目是：「英國勞工黨是否會使歐洲背棄共產主義？」登載子「讀者文摘」五月號上。</p>
<p>據我（StanleyHigh）的意見，世界共產主義和英國勞工政府有勢不兩立的趨向：假如勞工政府成功，國際共產主義的威信和勢力可能日趨衰落；反之，假如勞工政府的領袖和政策失敗，那麽共產主義的聲勢就可能伸展開來。</p>
<p>我所以抱這種信念，有兩點理由：第一，因爲共產主義者就抱這種見解。自從勞工黨的溫和民主改革政策開始形成以來，國際共產主義者在他們報紙上和策略方面，都可以看出共產主義者要加以打倒的對象，不是別人，正是英國勞工黨！第二，因爲歐洲政治上所發生的種種變化，業已開始證實這一點。英國勞工政府執政九月，不是助長了而是剝弱了國際共產主義的勢力，並且使歐洲失勢已久的溫和派各政黨，恢復了固有的信念。</p>
<p>英國勞工黨於七月五日競選獲勝而執政，其影響是非常重大而深遠的。政治哲學家諾爾堡博士目光銳利，他說：「歐洲解放國家幾乎立刻認爲英國勞工黨的政綱，是共產主義的極好代替品。」</p>
<p>自從英國勞工黨執政以來，歐洲曾有六個解放國家舉行自由選舉，出乎意料之外的，共產黨在六個國家中都沒有獲勝，他們的收獲，遠較一般有資格的觀察家的預測爲小。</p>
<p>爲了勞工黨在英國成功而使歐洲政治發生的轉變，已經不限於西歐而開始擴展到南歐和東歐方面去。東歐是共產主義的保壘，竟也發生這種現象，不能不叫人嘖嘖稱奇！「時報」說：「這是歐洲最大的政治新聞。在匈牙利，奧地利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，波蘭，南斯拉夫這些國家中，共產主義反對勢力的興起幾乎是不能想像的，然而不可能的已經成爲可能了」。</p>
<p>目前歐洲的政治傾向，並不是僅僅反共產主義的。事實上，誠如「紐的時報」所說，「這是民主主義的復蘇」。一度對民主主義逐漸失却信仰的歐洲民衆，現在信念又在改變過來了。</p>
<p>這種世態的變化，在國際共產主義者看來，倒並不是出乎意料之外的事情。馬克斯和列寧曾經用幾千幾萬個字諄諄吿誠共產黨的後人說：共產主義的最大威脅，並不是肆無忌憚的資本主義，因爲資本主義本身中間，就有促成其瓦解的因素在內。共產黨的天字第一號敵人，是社會黨人，社會民主黨人，和自由黨人，以及一切反對以暴力革命而主張用改革方法爭取大衆的人物。</p>
<p>當國際共產主義者不能阻止這種運動興起的時候，他們就設法去參加這種運動，借此擴充勢力，而在適當時期從內部來加以推翻。例如爲了推翻一九二四年英國第一個勞工政府起見，列寧就親自規定這種辦法。</p>
<p>在去年英國舉行選舉的時候，英國共產黨早就預料到勞工黨可能獲勝。爲推行其一貫的策略起見，他們就兩度要求和勞工黨聯合而兩度遭到拒絕。在選舉之後，他們發生第三次的呼龥，而遭到第三次的拒絕。勞工黨在拒絕共產黨要求的信中說：「過去二十五年的經驗，已經使本黨全國執行委員會深知共黨當前的計劃和久遠的目的，根本和勞工黨不同</p>
<p>共產黨報紙因計劃不成，憤慨萬分。美國共產黨的「每日工人報」說：「事實上，英國勞工黨彷彿已經對歐洲各國的社會黨講：你們和共產黨斷絕關係，就保證可以得到英國的支持，這是貝文政策的核心。」</p>
<p>職是之故，這個由英國領導的運動，已經變成了莫斯科的重要政治課題。所以當貝文和維辛斯基在安全理事會中相遇的時候，事實上他們兩人不惟代表兩個大國，更重要的是代表兩種根本不同的生活方式，眞正的爭執是社會主義和共產主義的爭執。凡是明瞭戰後世界潮流的人，都知道當前最尖銳的政治思想鬥爭，就發生於上述兩種哲學之間。</p>
<p>的確，這兩種哲學的老祖宗，都是馬克斯的學說，但是它們之間最大的不同點，就是社會主義已經不斷地傾向自由主義，而共產主義則已變成全能主義性質。英國勞工黨的競選獲勝，就是這場思想戰的引錢。</p>
<p>所以本文在闢頭就說：英國勞工黨的競選獲勝，是歐洲政治上一個影響深遠的重大事件。</p>
<h3>解決世界屋荒美國擬定計劃</h3>
<p>— 溪</p>
<p>美國，像其他各國一樣，也正閙着歷史上最嚴訊的屋荒。前次得基州魯伊斯維市長魏耶特奉杜魯門總統命令，負責計劃解決美國的住屋問題，魏氏奉命以後就傾注全副精神於這一個問題他建議動員美國大部份的建築，凖備在兩年內建造新住房一百七十萬幢。由於戰前美國「新政策」的失敗所留下的後果，及戰時建築房屋的停頓，他的困難問題不一而足。建築業人士大聲疾呼攻擊他和他的政策。因爲他嚴厲限制他們的四千五百億元的建築計劃，營造業因此受到了重大的打擊。</p>
<p>但是魏耶特不顧一切，用斷然的處置，規定只許建造低値的房屋·魏耶特的計劃，準備用六種方法建築房屋，並將房屋分成四等，就兩年間的需要，預定擬建築的各等房屋的數目。美國建築業對於高貴房屋的需要已能滿足，但是對於建築廉價的房屋相差尙遠，魏耶特的目的就想改變道一種情勢；換句話說，他希望减少高貴的房屋，而多築廉價的房屋，以滿足一般民眾的需要。要達到這一個月的，他必須抑仗於活動房屋的建築和其他完全新創而尙未試過的方法。</p>
<p>同時有一種最廉價而最迅連的建築法，叫做「就地建築法」，能够在短時聞內築成多數的住屋。提倡這種建築法的建築師，最著稱的一位是舊金山的波亨農。他的方法，第一步先在建築房屋的空地上或附近地方搭起一架輕便的　木織，把建築房壓所　板木　椽柱子地板等一一　好，閱時用築路機把房　的　　打好，最後用釘子把各項　就的現成木材釘合起來，就此搭成了房屋的　　·一九四四年波氏曾在加州奧克蘭附近用這種方法，建造房屋七百幢，工作時間共計六百九十三小時。</p>
<p>魏耶特認爲「就地建築法」及「活動房屋建築法」是達到他的建屋目標的兩種有效方法。但是他相信大多數的新屋將由國內數千傳統的小租模營造師來建築。因此他又獎勵小規模營造　所能採用的另外一種建築方法。這種方法把現成的房屋重要設備—如浴室·橱房·暖氣設備等—作爲核心，在其周圍建築起房屋來。這種現成的房屋設備可以解決昂貴而複雜的屋內設備問題。目前這種現成房屋設備的生產雖極遲緩，但至少有一家大規模的實業公司已在準備大量生產。魏耶特預定在兩年內建築新屋二百七十萬幢，如果此項計劃獲得成功，那麽建築廉價房屋的這一項實業將打定基礎，便可由此發揚光大。苟如是，則非特美國的屋荒可以解決，同時世界各地的屋荒或許也能迎刃而解了。</p>
<h3>珍聞</h3>
<p>— 奇</p>
<p>不久以後，蘋果，橘子等鮮菓，在採下幾星期或幾個月以後，仍舊可以保持新鮮，像剛纔採下來時一樣。辦法很簡便：用一種特製的薄膜（最薄的只有萬分之一吋厚）把那水菓包裏起來，即使是容易腐斕的蘋果，也可以保持到十八個月以上。</p>
<p>火柴受潮了自然擦不出火來，但是萬能的科學已經解救了這一個缺憾。一根火柴放在潮濕的屋子裏幾個月以後，或者浮在水面二十四小時以後，依然可以擦得出火來。這種「防水」火柴，科學家已經化了百年的光陰從事硏究，到最近纔吿成功。這種新式火柴曾經在六種不同的溶液裏浸過，每種溶液在火柴上面敷上透時的薄膜。在戰事期間原是供陸軍在氣候潮濕的地方和海軍在救命艇內使用的。大約的在幾個月以後就可以流行於市面。</p>
<h3>世界之上誰最有錢</h3>
<p>— 竹</p>
<p>美國——或許是全世界最富有的女子威爾克斯，是華爾街巨頭海的格里恩的女兒。她的財產總計美金一萬萬零一百萬元。</p>
<p>她財產中最珍異的一份是價値二千萬元的珠寳飾物，內有綴有綠玉孔雀毛的金盔，金鋼鑽鑲嵌的貞操帶，和一盒子沒有鑲嵌的寳石。她從丈夫遺產和自已的財產所得到之進益是每年五百萬元。比較英國國王佐治六世在戰前支領的年俸，四百五十萬元，有過之無不及。現在英國國王的收入還不到此數。她能於二十四小時內調動現款一千萬元。</p>
<p>威爾克斯夫人的生活很有規律。她每天起身得很早，吃相當豐富的早餐（有水菓，鷄蛋土司咖啡等），上午十點鐘驅車上寫字間（是一家地產公司）辦公。</p>
<p>有人問歲爾克斯夫人，她打算把她的財產遺傳給誰，她只搖搖頭，不發言。</p>
<p>賭國近況</p>
<h3>蒙的卡羅依然無恙</h3>
<p>— 南譯</p>
<p>在法國東南地中海沿岸有一個極小的侯國，這就是有「賭國」之稱的摩納哥。該國面積僅二十方公里，人民的二萬五千餘，氣候溫和，風光明媚，是避暑勝地，境內的蒙的卡羅鎭，設有一個巨大的賭博公司，歐洲以至全世界愛好賭博的人，都「趨之若　」。八年的世界大戰使山河改觀，地圖變色，在這個「白雲蒼狗」的　世之中，蒙的卡羅的近况如何，想爲讀者所樂聞的吧？</p>
<p>美國的新聞記者阿克賽遜最近會經訪問過這個「世外桃源」的小國，事後就在「生活雜誌」上發表了一篇文章，叙述賭國的往事現狀，筆者就把其中的要點，摘錄在後面。</p>
<p>第一點要吿訴讀者的就是蒙的卡羅「照常營業」，在戰爭打得最火熱的時候，甚至空襲的流彈波及摩納哥國的時候，賭塲也沒有掛起「免戰牌」。</p>
<p>有如各國各地的賭塲都有雅緻的名稱一樣，蒙的卡羅大賭塲也有一個名不符實的雅號，叫做「海水浴堪」，這個名字，是賭塲創辦人勃期克在八十年前所取，有人問過他爲什麼取名如此文不對題，這位老滑稽家說：「還不是要使顧客的面子好看些麽」？</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，蒙的卡羅賭塲輪盤賭上的象牙球從來沒有停過，但是在送往迎來之中，顧客的面孔已經有了顯著的改變，雖然德國人，義國人，法國人，英國人，美國人……都有，但是貴族富紳，豪華的太太，美麗的姑娘已不多見，活躍在那裏的人物，已一變而爲戰時發國難財的黑市暴發戶了。</p>
<p>但是說戰爭對摩納哥毫無影響，也不免言之過甚。譬如有一次一般戰艦曾來該國訪問，不巧船上的現鈔全部不翼而飛，這一件事，使船上的長官大發雷霆，聲言失款如不尋獲，就要砲轟蒙的卡羅賭塲的銅屋頂，後來這件事總算「皆大歡喜」的結束，失　「原　　趙」。</p>
<p>再有一次在戰爭將近結束的階段，　國人對於黃鋼極感缺乏，於是念頭就轉到蒙的卡　的鋼　頂上來，幸虧佔領摩納哥的德軍司令讀過有癢蒙的卡羅的許多小說，不願過份糟塌這個藝術寳庫，因此又度過了一次　　！</p>
<p>蒙的卡羅八十年來年年　　，惟有一九三二九—一九四〇年爲例外，虧損了五百八十萬法郞，過後又恢復獲利。戰爭結束以後，爲了各地生活的艱難，生意倒又遜色起來。</p>
<p>目前的困難雖多，但是蒙的卡羅依然頗具自信，以爲已往的黃金時代總有恢復來臨的一天。賭塲管理處已經在籌備廣播電台一座，預備把聳人聽聞的「賭經」播送到全世界去，以便吸引遊客到這個山明永秀的小國來桓聲一些時日，那麽在旅館，食堂，賭場和風景區化費的金錢，就可以維持國家的開支。此外賭場也大事擴充，必須弄得包羅萬象，應有盡有，可以使遊客廣廣眼界，此外當店已恢復通宵當業，門上已經裝了彷彿像藥房門口一樣的警鈴，以應顧客的急需。</p>
<p>的確，凡是對世界旅行具有興趣的人，蒙的卡羅這個地方似乎也有去走一趙的必要。有一點是可以確定的，就是當地主人必竭誠招待無疑。</p>

<h3>陳逆槍決後</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>陳公博被槍決之前，迎連要求「好看」。</p>
<p>一次在法庭作最後審訊時，要求穿一件長衫；一次在赴刑場前，要求免　；一次在執刑時，要求法警乾脆一點，結論都是爲了「好看」。</p>
<p>其實，一粒子彈，從後腦進，右頰出，　好看也好看不了多少。關於這一點，聰明如陳公博，也還是想不穿的。嗚呼，甚矣哉「死要險」也。</p>
<p>陳公博現在業已伏法，中國人的傳統道德觀，是人死了也就一筆勾銷；這是情重於理法，不過歷史上還有一個例外，那就是吳子胥鞭屍的故事。</p>
<p>沿襲下來，自然就有憐才思想，和對失敗者的偏愛了。據說陳逆最初受審時，旁聽席上曾有人大鼓其掌；而判決之後，上海方面也有兩位仁兄替他申請覆判。昨天本版刋載的「周作人如何科刑」，也是一例。</p>
<p>例子太多了，過去如　瑞生沒有死哪，現在如希特勒尙在人間哪，連外國朋友也難免有此心理。</p>
<p>這是一種危險，演變而毁法亂紀，無眞是非矣。</p>
<h3>夏天逛公園</h3>
<p>— 平齊</p>
<p>上海共有十三處</p>
<p>「先生，吃些什麼？」</p>
<p>「DDT！」</p>
<p>在中山公園的一角，我聽見一位靑年遊客這樣吿訴公園茶室裏的茶房。遊伴們都爲這句新鮮的答案哈哈大笑，然後，叫他拿幾瓶汽水來。</p>
<p>天</p>
<p>氣漸漸熱了，公園裏的遊客突然增多。這是上海最便宜的消遣地方，花一百塊錢就可以拿到一小本門票，一共五張，全上海十三處公園任何一處都可通用。從六月一日起，公園關門時間已延長到晚上十點鐘，所以，在花了二十塊錢之後，祇要你有興緻，你就可以從一淸早一直逛到深夜。公園裏有茶室，外灘公園有西菜和蛋炒飯可吃，顧家宅的復興公園却有廣式點心，花前小坐，放懷大嚼，未始不是人生一樂。</p>
<p>可是——你打了防疫針沒有？</p>
<p>不</p>
<p>知道為甚麼，上海人特別喜歡吃刨冰，各公園的茶室裏也就常常大量供應。是不是乾凈，合不合衛生呢？我沒有聽見有誰檢騐過。那位想吃DDT的遊客喝的汽水是「××」牌子，而「××」牌子的飲料，別人倒代我們的衛生局檢騐好了—檢騐的人是美軍MP去找的，他們曾找出了二十二種飲料，「內含不潔及有害成份，不宜作爲人類飲料。」</p>
<p>工務局修理這十三家公園，成績的確是有的，剛剛勝利的時候，復興公園椅子上的本條都給人家拆下來常柴燒了，現在都已修好，塗上一層綠漆，和四圍的濃陰襯得相當調和。</p>
<p>可是，如果你是一位女遊客，我就又要問—你穿了高跟鞋沒有？</p>
<p>因爲，隨便那一個公園裏的柏油好上，都疏疏朗朗的佈滿了窪下去的小坑，有深有淺，有大有小，萬一你看看四面的風量實在太美麗了，或者一個不小心鞋跟就嵌在這些星羅棋布的小小陷坑裏，就會有發生悲劇的危險了。</p>
<p>公園，當然是孩子們的天堂。快樂的母親推了精巧漂亮的童車在公園裏慢慢走着，是多麼美麗的一幅圖畫！</p>
<p>可</p>
<p>是，如果你的孩子已經五六歲了，喜歡問長問短，尋根究底，那末，你帶他進公園之前，還是多考慮一下好。</p>
<p>因爲，公園裏面，有些事情是禁不起你的孩子尋根究底的。譬如說，虹口的中正公園裏常常有人蹲在地上打牌九，有些賭客還不過是十來歲的大孩子，他們一面賭一面嚷，我還看見過一次打架。外灘公園裏多的是奇奇怪怪的女人，她們打扮得奇奇怪怪，走路，看人的樣子，也着實很有些奇奇怪怪，到了夜裏，她們有時就向別的遊客拉拉扯扯起來了—如果你的孩子問起你來，你怎樣回答他呢？不</p>
<p>過，中山公園）就是以前的兆豐公園）裏的運動園卻很可以去看一看。那些動物們是幸福的，動物園的面積並不算大，可是這幾只兎子，猴子，鵝，三只熊，一只鹿——部比普通的上海人福氣多了，牠們實在數目太少，所以雖然也許有些寂寞，却從來不鬧屋荒。有人在走到動物園去的時侯，會因爲聞到了路上和公園水潭裏一陣陣的氣味而頭暈目眩，甚至於想吐，但這實在是給我們大家一個最好的廢物利用的機會，你想，仗打好了，留下了多少從此毫無用處的防毒面具？大家戴了防毒面其逛公園，不亦漪歟盛哉！</p>
<h3>看你窮</h3>
<p>— 的平</p>
<p>逸園的英文名字爲Canicrome意思是「狗圈」，讀音等於「看你窮」。以前有賽狗時，不知若干人難逃該圈，大窮而特窮；現在舞塲飯店其價昂貴，亦仍保持「看你窮」之氣慨。</p>
<p>新聞小天地</p>
<h3>美人魚好靜不好動</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>美人魚楊秀瓊，自失意於情塲後，一度銷聲匿跡。月前僑聲報發刋，楊以港僑之關係，被邀請入社作記者，吳市長夫人來滬時，曾撰述「訪問記」一文，刋載報端，文筆淸　，頗爲同行所稱道。但記者生涯，唯一條件，必須臉厚腿勤，到處「拋頭露面」，而美人魚則因不慣此套，好靜不好動，因而影響工作情緒，漸失興趣。迨至最近，楊終求去。旋爲行總財務廳所聘，担任『打字員」之職，於是美人魚之生活，至此又吿一轉變。或謂楊之遭逼，與現在行總同事之王人美，可稱同病相憐。而今相逢一室，當有「相逢何必曾相識」之感矣！</p>
<p>前和平日報社長萬梅子辭職後，現籌組一出版公司，取名「人从众」。憶成都有一小吃館，名爲「口　品」，可成絕妙好對。此外尙記得十數年前北平女師大有一學生名「石　磊」，（曾爲　產事，與和尙打官司，一度轟傳故都）與上述兩名相對，亦一不可多得之佳聯也。</p>
<p>美軍蒞滬以來，酒吧妓院，無不做得一筆好生意。蓋美軍久在戰塲，生活枯燥單調，一且登臨花花世界，狂歡作榮，原亦人之常情。但多數冒失之鬼，自恃「配備」齊全，以爲決無他虞，不料縱情過度，因而大意染疾者，却大有人在。迨凱旋返國，蹣跚登陸之際，家人不知，尙以爲「榮軍」歸來，倍加慰藉。後爲美軍總部所悉，乃實行集體治療，並詳細調査來源，據　者之報吿，其中上海部份，統計受書於妓女者共六十九人，吧女一百十一人，舞女（指水手舞塲言）三百十人，女友（？）二人。惟以上數字中，亦包括各外籍妓女，舞女，吧女及女友在內。事後美軍方面，且曾致函上海警局，對此表示「關懷」，並願協助警局「消毒」云云，此亦中美合作之外又一合作也。</p>
<h3>屈原後生</h3>
<p>— 司馬還</p>
<p>昨天喫粽子之餘，不知大家還能想到那位澤畔行吟的踸踔俊發有骨鯁有血性的民族大詩人吾？</p>
<p>楚懷王疏了他，頃襄王更不客氣，將他遷之於江濱，這位博聞强志明於治亂嫻於辭令的文士，遭遇父子兩期的絀涉，怎不憂愁幽思，懷石自投汨羅，而憤憤以求獨清呢？</p>
<p>倘使將屈原後生兩千多年的今日，同樣也再碰到那位對他一讒再讒的上官大夫，他也許會陪着笑臉跑公館，打點打點，願意忝列幹部，陞官發財，左右逢源，嘸啥話頭。</p>
<p>然而，年年端午，我們又如何才能喫到粽子，又如何作龍舟競渡之節戲？</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Marshall, Two-Hour Meeting and Lunch Together</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] After returning to Nanjing last night, Chairman Chiang went directly to his official residence at the military academy to rest. He did not receive any guests, but he did receive Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, and Chen Cheng, with whom he spoke for about an hour. It is reported that at 10:35 AM on the 4th, Special Envoy Marshall visited the Chairman and had a conversation for about two hours, after which they had lunch together. The content of the conversation was not disclosed, but according to sources close to Marshall, this was the first time Marshall had met with the Chairman after returning to Nanjing, and they had a long and in-depth conversation. It is believed that both sides discussed the urgent issues of receiving sovereignty over the Northeast, restoring full transportation, reorganizing and unifying the military, and strengthening the authority of the Executive Headquarters execution groups, all of which are matters of national concern. This day is also the Dragon Boat Festival, and Marshall has been studying Chinese history and folklore extensively, so his conversation with the Chairman touched on the historical significance of this festival, revealing a feeling of profound nostalgia for the past and present. It is also reported that after receiving Marshall, the Chairman also received government representatives to listen to their reports.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] After Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, an atmosphere of peaceful negotiation permeated the capital. However, opinions differ on how to resolve the Northeast issue. Some say that Zhou Enlai and Marshall exchanged views on various issues during their conversation yesterday, and that on one particular issue, the CCP politely declined the US side's right to make the final decision, insisting that Chairman Chiang should make the final decision. This kind of argument has been seen frequently recently, but because its wording is simple and its meaning unclear, the general reader feels confused. According to a neutral source who spoke to our newspaper reporter, it is indeed necessary for all current issues to be left to the Chairman's decision, but one principle must be made clear: that Chairman Chiang is earnestly expected to make the final decision on all issues related to the peaceful acceptance of sovereignty in the Northeast, the restoration of transportation, and the reorganization and unification of the military, based on national policy. Once this principle is clarified, the situation can be expected to become clearer. Otherwise, even if Su and Zhang were resurrected, the discussion would only become more and more confused, and ultimately fruitless.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] General Marshall visited Chairman Chiang this morning and began discussions at 11:00 AM, which lasted for three hours. It is generally believed that Marshall directly raised the issue of peace or war with Chairman Chiang. Afterwards, Marshall began a long conversation with Zhou Enlai, which lasted until the evening. Some sources believe that the issue of peace or war will be decided within a few hours. It is generally believed that Marshall's secretary's peace plan is flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances. Neutral parties believe that Marshall can balance the demands of both the KMT and the CCP.</p>

<h3>National Government Memorial Week; Chief of General Staff Chen Reports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng attended the National Government Memorial Week on the 4th and gave a military report, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Military Reorganization: The National Army currently has 89 infantry corps, 239 divisions (including 3 youth army corps and 8 divisions, excluding the CCP's 115th, 120th, and 129th divisions), 2 cavalry corps, and 13 brigades. From March of this year to the end of February next year, these should be reorganized into 30 infantry corps (90 divisions) and 10 cavalry brigades. The surplus officers and soldiers will be discharged or transferred. The reorganization and demobilization of the above troops will be carried out in two steps. The first step is to reduce each corps by one-third, that is, the original corps with three divisions and nine regiments will be reduced to a division with three brigades and six regiments, and the original corps with two divisions and six regiments will be reduced to a division with two brigades and four regiments. All independent divisions will be reorganized into independent brigades with two regiments. The second step will be implemented in accordance with the basic plan signed by the Military Tripartite Group, but after the 90 divisions are formed according to the prescribed establishment, they should be gradually formed into 30 corps, each corps with three divisions, and gradually introduced to the designated locations as stipulated in the basic plan. The reorganization work of the first step will be carried out in three phases. The first phase involves reorganizing the troops along the Longhai Railway and in the northwest (excluding Xinjiang Hexi), totaling 27 corps and 66 divisions, from March to the end of April. The second phase involves reorganizing the troops along the Yangtze River and south of the Yangtze River, totaling 32 corps and 92 divisions, from May 1 to the end of June. The third phase will begin on July 1, and the plan will be determined separately. After the reorganization of the first step is completed, the reorganization of the second step will continue. The method is as follows: each infantry division will be reorganized into 90 divisions in accordance with the formal establishment, each division with two brigades and four regiments, totaling 14,000 people, and each corps headquarters with approximately 6,300 people. The starting date of the reorganization of each corps and division must be determined by the Executive Headquarters, approximately 8 to 9 corps will be reorganized each month, and its establishment will be determined separately. In North China, a total of 7 corps must be formed into one corps in accordance with the prescribed establishment before September 1 of this year, so as to be combined with the CCP troops into a group army in the seventh month (i.e., September of this year). The other 6 corps can be formed separately later, and three of them are designated to be combined with the CCP troops into a group army.</p>
<p>(2) Establishment of the Ministry of National Defense: The reorganization of the original central military institutions has begun, and the original business of these institutions has been transferred to the Ministry of National Defense for continued handling. The Ministry of National Defense was formally established on June 1. Regarding the reorganization of military institutions, Chairman Chiang gave three instructions before returning to the capital: (1) It is hoped that all levels of generals will take the national interest as the premise, and that the adjustment of military institutions is absolutely necessary based on the current and future needs of the country. (2) The reorganization of military institutions is based entirely on the military organization and system of the United States. (3) The reorganization should be completed before the end of May this year.</p>
<p>There are four legislative principles of the Ministry of National Defense:</p>
<p>First, to govern the military with politics. According to the experience of past wars, governing the military with politics is the most appropriate for the application of national policy and the implementation of national defense. This concept is particularly prevalent in Britain and the United States. This reorganization of military institutions, the abolition of the Military Affairs Commission, which was separated from the administration, and the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, is in line with this idea.</p>
<p>Second, to return the military to the state. Returning the military to the state is a consistent policy of our party. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense is to implement this policy. Our country will soon implement democratic constitutionalism, and it is even more unacceptable for military institutions to be separated from the administrative system and independent.</p>
<p>Third, to unify the command of the army, navy, and air force. In modern warfare, the strategy and tactics of the military itself have constituted the unity of the army, navy, and air force. Moreover, as a result of motorization dominating military affairs, the suddenness of war is extremely great. In order to deal with emergency measures, the military administration and military orders of the army, navy, and air force must be unified. This reorganization of national defense institutions is to adopt this system.</p>
<p>Fourth, the organization of the Ministry of National Defense. The head of state concurrently serves as the Grand Marshal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in wartime, so this organization is applicable in both war and peacetime, so that there will be no confusion due to sudden wars. This reform has four spirits and is to establish a century-old system and lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country. The Ministry of National Defense also has two characteristics: (1) The division of powers and functions: all "powers" of the military are in the hands of the government, while the military's professional "capabilities" belong to the military department. (2) The concrete manifestation of the three-link system: the Ministry of National Defense represents the government and has the power to supervise, the General Staff Headquarters plans and guides, and the General Headquarters is responsible for implementation. This fully demonstrates the spirit of the three-link administrative system.</p>
<p>The reorganization of the original military institutions into the Ministry of National Defense is implemented in three stages. In the first stage, the unfinished business of the original institutions will continue to be handled by the original institutions. In the second stage, the new institutions will be reorganized and merged in accordance with the new organizational structure. In the third stage, the new institutions will officially start their business. As for the staff of the original institutions, in addition to being incorporated into the new institutions as much as possible, the surplus staff will be properly arranged, and the detailed method will be the same as the demobilization and resettlement method of the troops. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Cares about the Treatment of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, he inquired in detail about the issue of adjusting the treatment of civil servants, which had been discussed many times without a decision. It is reported that this case will be finalized at the National Defense Supreme Council meeting held on the 5th. According to sources, the Chairman is extremely concerned about this case and advocates for a reasonable adjustment.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Broadcast Address to the Youth Army (Continued)</h3>
<p>In addition to cultivating habits of order and discipline, life training also aims to develop our virtue of hard work and endurance. The revolutionary cause is originally a cause of saving people and the world. Revolutionaries must not hesitate to relieve the suffering of others at the expense of their own suffering, and to seek the happiness of others at the expense of their own happiness. If we can endure the pain that ordinary people cannot endure, and undertake the work that ordinary people cannot undertake, then we will not be ashamed of being revolutionary cadres. All of you, my young men, as long as you study the development of our National Revolution, you can know that the victory of our Anti-Japanese War today is entirely due to the struggle out of hard work, endurance, risk-taking, and difficulty. When our revolutionary army was in the 15th year of the Republic of China, it was able to defeat warlords from all provinces of the country who were hundreds of times stronger than us with a small number of troops and inferior equipment. It was by relying on this revolutionary aspiration to save the country, and the sincere dedication to sacrifice and fight for the Three Principles of the People and for the nation that we achieved victory. This is not only the case for the success of the army, but also for the success of individuals. If you look at the children of wealthy families, who cannot endure hardship, work hard, be thrifty, and simple, but only seek enjoyment and ease, in the end, which one can achieve results? From this, we can know that if a person wants to succeed in his career, he must be able to endure hardship, work hard, take risks, ask only for work, and not count the rewards. Especially you young men, you are only in your twenties and thirties, and fortunately, you can participate in the revolutionary ranks today, so you must regard saving the country and saving the people as your duty, regard hard work as your right, and regard endurance as your duty. If we do not do this, but only count the rewards and seek enjoyment, then we will certainly be eliminated by the times. Everyone knows that the United States is now the richest and strongest country in the world, and President Truman has recently asked his people to tighten their belts and save food to promote it. The youth of our country are all undergoing military training, and our China is such a poor and weak country, and the economic and production capacity is so backward. If our youth can no longer endure hardship, work hard, be thrifty, and simple, how can we 희수면戈一介一, 世代有, and how can we survive in the modern international arena.</p>
<p>The above is to explain the importance of life training for a person's success. Now I also want to pass on my personal experience to all my young men. At the age of 21, I was admitted to the Baoding Military Academy. In the second year, I was sent from the military academy to Japan to study the army. At the age of 24, I was assigned to a Japanese field artillery regiment and enlisted for one year. During this year, I lived entirely as a soldier, extremely monotonous and solemn. The restraint of discipline and the monotony of life, dry and tasteless, made me feel very unreasonable at the time. But today, looking back, the ability of my life to be simple and my work to be constant, forty years as one day, is indeed due to the foundation laid by this year of soldier life training. I think that my lifelong revolutionary will and spirit, and the revolutionary fearless spirit I have today, are entirely due to the influence of this year of soldier life. If I had not had this year of military experience and had not undergone such a soldier's life, I might not have had such a revolutionary career today, so you must cherish this past year of soldier life and training, especially to understand, comprehend, and practice it, so that you will be able to succeed as a revolutionary cadre, and live up to the expectations of the national compatriots and my call for you to enlist and receive training.</p>
<h3>National Army Advances Towards Lafa; Train Service Between Changchun and Jilin Resumes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] Whether the National Army has reached the outskirts of Harbin is unclear. Two different reports were simultaneously received here today. One said that the National Army marched north in three routes, and the vanguard had reached three miles from the outskirts of Harbin. The other was Zheng Dongguo's statement in Changchun on the 2nd that the National Army had made no new progress in recent days, and that the northeast of Yongji had reached the vicinity of Lafa, while the north had stopped on the south bank of the Songhua River, waiting to clear out the Communist troops with Yongji and Changchun as the center, before starting the first advance towards Harbin. Compared to the two, the latter is more reliable. It is also rumored that the Communist troops are using the terrain to build fortifications along the Xing'an Mountains and fortify Qiqihar.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The train service between Changchun and Jilin will resume on the 4th. General Liao Yaoxiang told reporters that after military transportation starts, passenger transportation can also be sold soon. The National Army in Jilin is advancing towards Lafa Station. Lafa Station is an important stronghold on the Labin Line, and trains on the north bank can reach Harbin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Northeast National Army Headquarters, 4th] General Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of General Du Yuming, revealed today that after the Communist troops blew up the iron bridge three days ago, they are now trying to fight a defensive battle to defend Harbin in the area 75 miles south of Harbin on the north bank of the Songhua River. Zhao Jiaxiang is only 38 years old and is the youngest two-star general in the National Army. When reporters asked where the war had taken place, he said: "It is not fierce in the northeast of Jilin, it is just a rearguard covering battle, the purpose is to delay our army's advance."</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Temporary Group; Inspects Zongping, North of Peiping, Huairou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The temporary executive group of the Executive Headquarters, which had returned from inspecting Anci, Panggezhuang and other places, set off again yesterday to inspect the Mahuangyu area under Huairou County, north of Peiping, because it had previously been reported that five regiments of the Communist Army's 13th Brigade, led by Xiao Wenjiu, had arrived there to build fortifications.</p>

<h3>Communist Army Activities on Various Lines in North China; The War is on the Brink of Explosive Danger</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] According to reliable sources, the Communist Army has again carried out major destruction in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. They attacked the National Army near Liulihe but were repelled. Several kilometers of the railway have been damaged successively and are now being repaired. It is also reported that more than 5,000 Communist troops active on the side of the Zhengtai Railway are also on the move. The Communist troops active on the Beining Line are rushing towards Tangshan, and it is rumored that Tangshan City is surrounded. At the same time, Kailuan, Lutai, and Hangu also telegraphed for help one after another. However, it is reported that the Communist troops in the Xianghe area have been defeated. The purpose of the Communist Army is obviously to seize the Kailuan coal mines, but according to people from North China, the strength of the National Army there should not be underestimated. If the Communist Army acts rashly and threatens the Kailuan coal mines, it will encounter a serious blow. The war in North China is on the brink of explosive danger.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] According to transportation sources, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway are still being damaged from time to time. The stationmaster and some of the staff of the Jinpu Railway have been detained by the Communist Army and have not yet been released.</p>
<h3>Meeting to Revise the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System to Open Tomorrow Morning in the Capital; Discussion on Tax Reform and Establishing Provincial Budgets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] The meeting to implement the revised financial revenue and expenditure system is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 6th at the Lixing Society. The conference will be presided over by Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and Minister of Food Xu Kan. It is also reported that the conference has requested Chairman Chiang and President Zhu to attend and give instructions at the opening ceremony. The central issue of this conference is the reform of the tax system, which is also an important adjustment to the current finances. After the conference achieves results, it will be announced and implemented nationwide. Conference members are scheduled to register starting today. It is reported that the conference is expected to have 160 attendees, including provincial governors, directors of finance departments, heads of food administration offices, mayors of municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, and directors of finance bureaus. However, some provinces have also sent observers. As of tonight, more than 30 people have registered, with a total of more than 40 people including observers. The governors, heads of land and grain departments, and directors of finance departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Songjiang, and Nenjiang provinces, as well as the directors of finance departments of Suiyuan and Chahar provinces, have already begun submitting proposals to the conference. Furthermore, the conference has already drafted important proposal documents, but they are still awaiting approval and organization. The conference is scheduled to last three days, proceeding rapidly with the most economical use of time, aiming for maximum efficiency. In addition, Finance Minister Yu is scheduled to hold a tea party at the ministry on the afternoon of the 5th to receive the members attending the conference in Nanjing and listen to the opinions of the representatives.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] It is reported that after this revision of the financial revenue and expenditure system, the provinces will be able to establish their own budgets. Fifty percent of the central government's business tax revenue, twenty percent of the land tax, and a portion of inheritance taxes will be allocated to the provinces. This will put county finances in good condition, and in the future, the collection of arrears will be changed to payment in kind.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] It is reported that Chairman Chiang will take the opportunity of the visit of provincial-level administrative heads to Nanjing to attend the meeting to implement the revised financial revenue and expenditure system to separately summon the provincial governors, directors of finance departments, mayors, and directors of finance bureaus to inquire and give instructions. It is also planned that during the period of military reorganization, he will take the opportunity of the visit of regimental commanders to Nanjing to report on their duties to summon the generals, listen to recent developments in the military, and discuss military reorganization, education, health, and the lives of officers and soldiers. The rumor that an important military conference will be held in the near future is inaccurate.</p>

<h3>The Corpse of Traitor Chen Gongbo is Prepared for Burial; Execution of Traitor Chu Minyi is Near; Traitor Li Shengwu Sentenced to Twelve Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th Dispatch] After the execution of traitor Chen Gongbo on the morning of the 3rd in Suzhou, the prison authorities immediately notified his family to come to Suzhou to prepare the body for burial. It is now known that Chen's corpse was received by his servant Liu Yachen at the Third Prison at about 1:00 PM on the 4th and sent to the Suzhou Funeral Home. At around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, his wife Li Lizhuang finally arrived in Suzhou from Nanjing with her son Chen Gan. They went to the funeral hall and bowed three times to the remains, without shedding tears. She was wearing a light blue cloth cheongsam, and Chen's son was wearing a black Zhongshan suit. The color of sadness overflowed his face. A coffin made of high-quality catalpa wood was purchased for 900,000 yuan. The burial was simple, with only a drummer and no Taoist priests chanting scriptures to offer comfort. The clothes used for Chen's burial were all Zhongshan suits. Today, the number of people who went to the mourning hall to see the remains of this generation's great traitor was no less than several thousand, and the crowds were so dense that even the family members could not step forward to pay their respects. Many of the doors and windows of the mourning hall were damaged, and the desolate scene after the death of the traitor was very different from his former glory.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th Dispatch] Traitor Chu Minyi was sentenced to death by the Jiangsu High Court on April 22nd. His wife, Chen Wuzhen, dissatisfied with the original verdict, applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The First Criminal Division of the Supreme Court upheld the original verdict on May 25th and approved it. The ruling was sent from Nanjing to Suzhou by express delivery on the evening of the 3rd. The High Court delivered it to Chu's prison cell in the Third Prison on the morning of the 4th. After the reporter inquired, he visited President Sun Hongji of the court and learned that the execution order had not yet arrived, but it would take no more than two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th Dispatch] At 7:00 AM this morning, Chu Minyi's wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, along with her daughter Chu Mengyuan and Wang Wenxun, arrived in Suzhou from Nanjing. They immediately went to the visiting room of the Third Prison to visit Chu Minyi. At that time, Chu Minyi had received the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the original verdict and immediately told his wife and daughter: "My execution is near. You don't need to worry. Live peacefully." His wife and daughter wept bitterly during the meeting, which lasted thirty minutes before they separated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] The Capital High Court judged the case of the traitor Li Shengwu at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. The defendant was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. After hearing the verdict, Li showed no expression in court. He was then escorted by two bailiffs to the Capital District Court Detention Center for temporary detention. Once the review and approval are obtained, he will be officially transferred to the Capital Prison for execution. The main points of the judgment are as follows: "Li Shengwu, conspiring with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country, is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for ten years. All property, except for what is necessary for the family's living expenses, is confiscated." The full text of the judgment pointed out that Li's actions of assisting the puppet regime were undeniable, and he could not shirk legal responsibility. However, it stated that when the defendant was the Minister of Education of the puppet regime, he requested the puppet Central Political Committee to issue an amnesty decree, as evidenced by the Puppet Judicial Administration Gazette published on July 8, 1940, which benefited patriotic people and participants of the resistance movement. When he was the Minister of Education of the puppet regime, he made great efforts to maintain church schools and private schools, preventing them from being trampled by the enemy. Furthermore, more than eighty people, including Bao Zhong, came forward to testify to his beneficial acts for the people, and the evidence was indeed reliable. Therefore, the sentence was reduced according to law to show fairness. It is understood that the eighty people mentioned in the judgment, including Bao Zhong, are current faculty members of Jinling University and various private middle schools in this city.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Judgment: The Crime of Traitor Chu is Clearly Proven; Original Verdict Upheld</h3>
<p>Supreme Court Special Criminal Judgment, Thirty-Fifth Year, Jing Fu Zi No. 161</p>
<p>Petitioner Chu Chen Shunzhen is the wife of Chu Minyi, 40 years old, address unknown.</p>
<p>Defendant Chu Minyi, male, 64 years old, resident of Xuzhen Town, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Regarding the petitioner's request for a retrial of the defendant's case of treason, based on the judgment of the Jiangsu High Court on April 22nd of the 35th year of the Republic of China, this court rules as follows:</p>
<p>Ruling:</p>
<p>The original verdict is upheld.</p>
<p>Reasoning:</p>
<p>The defendant in this case, Chu Minyi, originally served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. After the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he took refuge in Shanghai. In the summer of 1939, Wang Zhaoming arrived in Shanghai to secretly collude with the Japanese invaders and convened the Sixth National Congress of the puppet Kuomintang. At that time, the defendant participated, serving as the Secretary-General of the puppet Central Party Headquarters, a member of the Central Executive Committee, and a member of the Supervisory Committee. He followed Wang in running between Nanjing and Qingdao, consulting with the puppet "Renovation" and "Temporary" governments on the issue of reorganization. After an agreement was reached, the puppet National Government was established in Nanjing on March 30 of the following year, where he served as the Vice President of the Puppet Executive Yuan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Puppet Government, and was also in charge of the return of the Puppet Government to the capital. In May of the same year, he accompanied Chen Gongbo to Japan in the capacity of a puppet deputy envoy to offer thanks. Later, he participated in the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, allowing the Japanese invaders to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, as well as station fleets in China's territorial waters and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, he issued the "Sino-Japanese-Manchu" joint declaration, recognizing "Manchukuo," thereby undermining the integrity of China's territory. In February of the following year, he was transferred to be the ambassador to Japan, contacting the Axis powers to recognize the puppet government. In September, he returned to serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the puppet government. After the puppet government declared war on the United States and Britain in 1943, he concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese invaders and accompanied Wang Dao to Tokyo to attend the Greater East Asia Conference, repeatedly using fallacies to spread propaganda to destroy the United States and Britain and eliminate the Central Government. In July 1945, he took office as the Governor of the puppet Guangdong Province, concurrently serving as the Commander of the puppet Guangdong Security Force and the Director of the puppet Guangzhou Pacification Office. The defendant has confessed to these facts repeatedly during the investigation and the Guangzhou trial. The original trial confirmed that his confession was consistent with his "Autobiography of Participation in the Peace Movement" and the confessions of accomplices Chen Gongbo and Chen Bi-jun in other cases. Furthermore, the appointment letter of the puppet National Government, the "Joint Statement of the Greater East Asia Conference," and the "Record of the Puppet National Government's Delegation to Japan for Gratitude" extracted from the Chen Gongbo case, "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government," "The Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," and "Domestic News Clipping Book" were sufficient to confirm this. It was therefore determined that his actions of colluding with the enemy to plot rebellion were extremely obvious, and the circumstances of the crime were particularly serious. Based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, Paragraph 1, First Section, Article 28, and Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, he was sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property, except for what is necessary for the family's living expenses, was confiscated. The determination of the facts and the application of the law were correct. The petitioner's argument for a retrial states that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the enemy invaders penetrated deep, and Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui fell, the defendant emerged to rescue the people and preserve the nation's vitality and participated in the organization of the government and assumed duties. This was a division of labor and cooperation with armed resistance against Japan, with different paths leading to the same goal. As for his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was merely holding a nominal position. The defendant did not sign all the treaties concluded between China and Japan, the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchuria, and the declaration of war on the United States and Britain. Furthermore, he used Japan to recover the concessions of various countries, which was not without merit. This court believes that each of the points raised by the petitioner has already been argued by the defendant, and after the original organization investigated, it was deemed that they were just excuses and evasions, and were insufficient to be adopted. The reasoning has been explained in detail in the reasoning of the judgment. Furthermore, it was found that the defendant had served in key central positions, and when the enemy army penetrated deep and the war was urgent, he did not know how to cooperate with one heart to resist foreign aggression, but willingly attached himself to the rebels and betrayed the central government. According to his confession, after organizing the puppet government, he went to Japan to offer thanks, participated in the Greater East Asia Conference, and discussed the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and issued the Sino-Japanese-Manchu joint declaration and declared war on the Allied powers of Britain and the United States, expressing his willingness to live and die with the Japanese invaders. In his speech at the "Return to the Past and New Understanding" on September 18th, he mentioned that "Friendly countries (referring to the Japanese invaders) are doing their utmost to strengthen our National Government (referring to the puppet government) to continue to destroy Chongqing" and "In Greater East Asia, only a corner of Chongqing is still blindly engaging in war, but because the backing of the United States and Britain has been completely lost, Chongqing has become a turtle in a jar, and destruction is only a matter of time." His crimes of colluding with the enemy to plot resistance against his country have been extremely clearly proven. The petitioner's repeated arbitrary defenses are not worthy of adoption. The original judgment is correct and should be approved according to law. Based on the above conclusions, it is ruled that the judgment should be made according to Article 20, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, as stated in the main text. May 24th of the 35th year of the Republic of China, First Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, presiding judge Zai Jun, judge Li Shaoyan, judge Ren Ji, judge Lin Shangyou. It is certified that this is a true copy of the original, Secretary Li Shiping, May 29th of the 35th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Resources Committee and Guangdong Provincial Government Jointly Operate Wengjiang Hydropower Plant; First Phase of Project Scheduled to Be Completed in Two Years</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd Dispatch] The Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, jointly operated by the Resources Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government, has been surveyed by two groups of technicians dispatched by the Resources Committee to the related areas of Wengyuan, Yingde, and Renhua counties. The entire project plan budget and contract, etc., will be signed with the construction company in the short term. It is found that the initial operating expenses are estimated to be about 16 million US dollars. After the completion of the first phase of the project, which is scheduled to take two years, it can generate 170,000 horsepower. The engines and various equipment used in the plant are supplied under the Canadian Reciprocal Trade Agreement and are currently being dispatched to Hong Kong for unloading and transshipment to Wengjiang.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Flooded with Foreign Cigarettes; Local Tobacco Industry on the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd Dispatch] Recently, the market in Guangzhou has been flooded with duty-free foreign cigarettes, causing the local cigarette industry to suffer severely. More than eighty manufacturers have closed down one after another, with more than sixty facing serious difficulties. According to the person in charge of the Cigarette Industry Association, the current tax on local cigarettes has reached 100%, which is a heavy burden. Smuggled foreign cigarettes are rampant, and the price of foreign cigarettes is almost equal to that of local cigarettes. Therefore, the general public abandons local cigarettes in favor of foreign ones. As a result, the business of local cigarettes, which had a monthly turnover of 200,000,000 yuan, has plummeted. The number of unemployed cigarette workers has reached 30,000. If the domestic cigarette industry collapses and foreign cigarettes seize the market, the country will suffer another huge loss in revenue. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Renaming of Major Roads in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] In memory of the late Chairman Lin Sen, the Nanjing Provisional Council sent a letter to the municipal government requesting that Hanzhong Road be renamed "Lin Sen Road."

They are scheduled to go to Linghu on June 1st to inspect the various construction projects of the Construction Association and give instructions.</p>
<p>County Council to Hold Meeting Within Days. The election of Wu Xing County councilors has been announced. A total of 63 townships have elected 63 councilors, including Shen Tianxin, Wen Xuanhen, Gu Ben, Xuan Yi, Mo Zuizeng, and Ling Tinghua.

The meeting to elect the speaker will be held within days. Shen Tianxin, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Huzhou Society, has arrived in Huzhou to prepare to attend, it is said.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Electricity Prices Increased in Urban Areas. Due to the increase in the price of coal allocated from Shanghai, the Hangzhou Power Plant needs to cover a loss of more than 50 million yuan per month. With the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, electricity prices will be moderately increased from June 1st. The electricity price for motors will be increased by 60 yuan from the original 155 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and the electricity price for lighting will be increased by 25 yuan from the original 135 yuan per kilowatt-hour. However, the price of allocated coal has increased again in Shanghai, and the plant is still losing money in fact.</p>
<p>Kunshan: All Sectors Console Retired Veterans. The 21st Corps of the National Army stationed in Kunshan has completed its reorganization as ordered. All soldiers of various units who have retired beyond their age limit, totaling 210, are about to leave the camp. Because the soldiers have been in the military for a long time and have contributed to the country, all sectors initiated a farewell meeting. After holding a meeting to discuss and decide on the methods, a large number of慰勞品 (consolation gifts) were collected.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Only a Few Money Shops are Open. As the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, the Qianzhuang (money shop) industry held a special meeting the other day. Only eight companies, including Tongxing, attended. In the past, there were a total of 37 registered money shops. Nine of them were damaged in the war, and a total of 28 could be repaired and opened. However, none of them have received deposits from merchants. The merchants are deeply pained and recall the cruel situation. The current remedial measure is to notify all the money shops to register with the Wuxi Improvement Zone and handle代烘 (proxy烘焙, most likely proxy banking) as much as possible to make up for the losses. Another conference will be held later.</p>
<p>Changshu: Security Team Reorganized into Police Team. The county government ordered the removal of Hu Mingyi, the captain of the security brigade, because his adjutant Pan Shijie and the second squadron leader Mu Jingbin forcibly bought yellow croakers in the third district, illegally profiting from them. After investigation, the facts were verified, and they were dismissed. The adjutant Pan Shijie was detained for four days, and the squadron leader Mu Jingbin received a major demerit. Bi Xinquan, the chief of the military section, was assigned to fill the vacancy. In addition, the team was reorganized into a police brigade with the approval of the county government meeting and was officially established on the 1st.</p>

On the 2nd, more than forty representatives were sent by the township chief Wang Youshi to the county to petition, requesting the county chief to investigate thoroughly and also to go to the pacification district headquarters to request relief. Li, the chief of the military section of the county government, has personally gone to the township to investigate the facts. It is said that the traffic police were reorganized from puppet troops, so there was this illegal incident.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of Overseas Study Policies</h3>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Education has successively announced the regulations for self-funded study abroad examinations and the measures for publicly funded study abroad. Registration for self-funded study abroad began on May 15th, and registration for publicly funded study abroad began on June 1st. Examinations will be held separately soon. Aspiring young people who want to pursue advanced studies will naturally have the opportunity to study abroad. Today's Chinese youth, those in the occupied areas, have undergone poisonous education from the enemy and puppets for seven or eight years. Those in the rear have also been blockaded by the war for seven or eight years. Once they have the opportunity to take the exam and go abroad, change their environment, breathe some fresh air, and study useful subjects with similar characteristics, it is a fortunate thing for both themselves and the country and society. However, should the government have an overall plan for a large number of young students studying abroad? This is the problem of China's overall overseas study policy.</p>
<p>China has been sending young students to study abroad for fifty or sixty years. People have different views on the success or failure of this system, just as the saying goes, "The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom." But in any case, given China's scientific backwardness and the scarcity of talent, if we want to catch up quickly and build a modern country successfully, the overseas study policy is still worth advocating. Over the years, it cannot be said that overseas students have made no contribution to the country. The reform of the political system, the transformation of society, and the establishment of various new undertakings, more or less have the blood and life sacrifices of overseas students in them. The reason why the results are not as good as our ideal is half due to the environment after the overseas students returned to China, and half due to the poor handling methods. As for the malpractices caused by the overseas study system, they are all man-made and not incurable diseases. In the late Qing Dynasty and the Beiyang era, there was no educational policy to speak of. Let's put that aside for now. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the government adopted a strict policy towards overseas study. Not only did publicly funded students have to pass the Ministry of Education's examination for admission, but self-funded students also had to obtain a study abroad certificate from the Ministry of Education before they could go through the procedures for going abroad. During the Anti-Japanese War, the government moved west, and the coastal areas were completely blockaded by the enemy. Transportation between China and foreign countries was cut off, and technical obstacles arose to studying abroad. For several years, even the publicly funded study abroad examinations were suspended, let alone self-funded study abroad. Later, when air transportation was smooth, the Ministry of Education began to continue the process in the temporary capital. Both publicly funded and self-funded students had to pass the examination before they were allowed to go abroad. Reading the two regulations recently announced by the Ministry of Education, today's overseas study policy can be said to remain the same, with no changes. We believe that in order to make the overseas study policy more effective, we must pay attention to the following two points:</p>
<p>First, the overseas study policy must be coordinated with the steps of national construction. Now that the Anti-Japanese War is over and we have entered the period of national construction, post-war China is facing many challenges and there are many things to be rebuilt. In addition to material and financial resources, it especially needs a large number of specialized talents and practical cadres. In the past seven or eight years, it is undeniable that China's higher education has declined due to the impact of the war. The world's new knowledge is advancing rapidly, while China's universities are still in the process of moving back and recovering. In addition, the war losses have been enormous, and restoration is not easy, and equipment is even more difficult to perfect. As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." Cultivating talents cannot be achieved overnight. In order to meet urgent needs, encouraging aspiring young people to study abroad is a timely and good strategy. But we must ask: Has the government already determined the steps and priorities for the work of national construction? Has it roughly calculated how many specialized talents and senior cadres are needed for a certain undertaking? Has it considered how to accommodate these trained talents after they return to the country, so that they will not feel that they are "not using what they have learned" or "not being appreciated for their talents"? If today we only know how to examine overseas students, and there is still no plan or coordination, then when a large number of young people go abroad now and return when their term expires in the future, they may not be able to "make the best use of their talents." Having pillars but no foundation, having doors and windows but no walls, still cannot construct a house. In terms of national finances, it is an economic waste; for young students, it is a waste of talent. Moreover, once Chinese students go abroad, they are like horses that have broken free of their reins, and no one cares. Everyone does their own thing, a pile of loose sand, which is not an exaggeration. We have seen that when the Soviet Union sent students to study abroad, the authorities had an overall plan, organization, and guidance, and the talents cultivated abroad were completely able to coordinate with the talents needed domestically. No wonder their three five-year plans were able to turn the country around. Looking back at China, the Ministry of Education's announcement of the number of self-funded and publicly funded students and subjects this time, apart from strengthening the control of self-funded students, there is really no overall plan to be seen. But we cannot solely blame the Ministry of Education. We must first ask whether the entire government has determined a plan and steps for the national construction work in the next three to five years; if not, how can we ask the Ministry of Education to coordinate?</p>
<p>Second, the overseas study examination must select real and practical talents. If the country has a national construction plan and determines the number of talents needed, it can use various methods to encourage young people to study abroad in the subjects that the country urgently needs, and it does not necessarily have to go through an examination. Because there is no official or black market price for foreign exchange now, why not approve foreign exchange to encourage aspiring young people to pursue advanced studies, rather than letting private individuals apply for foreign exchange to buy foreign goods indiscriminately. However, since there is an examination, attention should be paid to selecting true talents and practical skills during the examination. Not only should the favors of relatives and friends not be sold, but also why should we value rigid diplomas? The subjects can be tested strictly, the questions can be set more, the level can be raised higher, and the oral examination can be conducted more seriously. No matter who registers for the examination, as long as they are qualified, we should select the best among the qualified, without having to ask how many years they have studied or which school they graduated from. To be honest, among today's college students, there are quite a few graduates whose level may not be better than that of high school graduates fifteen years ago. Moreover, regardless of China or foreign countries, there are also many scholars in society who are fond of learning and thinking deeply, who have not graduated from college or attended college. They study on their own and have gained knowledge. If they are introduced and recommended by the president or professors of the university, why can't they have the same opportunity to take the exam? Therefore, judging the effectiveness of the examination from the examination system, it is better to strictly prevent cheating by the examiners than to restrict the qualifications of the examinees, because doing the latter can naturally select true talents, while merely paying attention to the former may lead to rejecting true talents from the door.</p>

<h3>Bevin Criticizes Soviet Policy: Is the World Only a Democratic Country in the Soviet Union? Adopting the Soviet System is Actually a Regression</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 4th (Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, elaborating on British foreign policy. In addition to expressing his approval of the US proposal to disarm Germany for twenty-five years, he also used gentle language towards the Soviet Union, hoping that it would cooperate with Britain and the United States on European issues. Bevin said: Due to the difference in political ideologies, the work of creating peace will be extremely difficult, but he is by no means pessimistic about the future of peace. Soviet Litvinov once said that peace is indivisible, and he absolutely agrees with this statement. If the Soviet Union cannot cooperate in Europe, there will be no peace and security. The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held again next week, and it is hoped that the Soviet side will show cooperation so that the European issue can be resolved. Bevin said that the British side had suggested to Stalin to extend the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship for fifty years, but it was not successful, and he deeply hoped that this could still be achieved. Bevin also reported and reviewed the negotiation situation at the last Paris conference.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 4th (Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech in the House of Commons today: If we do not want a total war, we must strive for total peace. In order to achieve this goal, countries must understand each other's motives. The situation after World War II is far more complicated than after World War I. The Soviet Union suffered heavy losses in the war and made many contributions. After the war, the cooperation of the Soviet Union is also necessary to ensure peace in Europe. However, there is a clear tendency on the Soviet side to believe that only the Soviet Union represents the interests of the workers, only the Soviet Union is a democratic country, and other countries are suspected of being fascist or pro-fascist. It seems that the security of the Soviet Union must be guaranteed after every country in the world adopts the Soviet system. However, Britain has its own path to progress. Our country began the industrial revolution 150 years ago. If we start to adopt the Soviet method now, it is not progress but regression.</p>
<h3>The Results of the French Election Satisfy Britain and the United States: The Connection Between the Three Countries Will Be Strengthened: The British Newspaper Believes That Democracy Has Triumphed Over Dictatorship: The Power of the Catholic Party Has Spread Throughout Western Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Diplomatic circles here today expect that the results of the general election in France will strengthen the country's political and economic ties with the United States and Britain. State Department officials remain silent on this, but the Republican People's Movement has overwhelmed the Communist Party in this election and has become the most powerful political party in France. The US government privately expressed its satisfaction. In general, US officials have a good relationship with French Foreign Minister Bidault, the leader of the Republican People's Movement. Now that Bidault's party has taken the lead in the political parties, it will inevitably adopt a stronger position on most issues. The US authorities firmly believe that whenever important issues arise that are very different from the Soviet Union's views, Bidault's position will agree with the United States and Britain. As for the economy, the Republican People's Movement will try to promote trade policies along a path closer to what the United States advocates, rather than nationalizing French industry as advocated by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 3rd] The "Standard Evening News" published an editorial today, reviewing the results of the French general election, stating: The results of this election are of great significance, not only for France but also for Europe. France has resolutely rejected the dictatorship system. At this time, the People's Republican Movement and the Socialist Party should jointly draft a constitution that can be accepted by the entire country. The "Star", the organ of the Liberal Party, also wrote an article stating: The idea of democracy has triumphed over the dictatorship of the proletariat. People have long predicted that post-war France will become a communist world, but now it seems to prove that their views are wrong. Among the parties in France that oppose the truly democratic parliament, communism is like a small wizard meeting a big wizard.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] As a result of the elections in France and Italy, Western Europe seems to be becoming the world of conservative parties and anti-communist parties. Except for Spain and Portugal, which are ruled by Catholic totalitarian regimes, the rest are all democratic and elect the power of right-wing Catholic parties. A political observer in London once said: The famous "Western European Group" seems to have gradually become a reality, but its center is not in socialist Britain, but in the Vatican. According to the results of the recent municipal elections in Italy, the Catholic Christian Democratic Party seems to have an advantage. If so, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Austria, southern Germany and Italy will all become the sphere of influence of Catholic parties.</p>
<h3>The Republican Party in Italy Has the Upper Hand in the Political System Election</h3>

<h3>Former Soviet Leader Mikhail Kalinin Passes Away</h3>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, 3rd] Prominent Soviet leader and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Kalinin, passed away today at 10:05 PM after a long and serious illness, at the age of seventy.</p>
<p>Kalinin's Brief History [Reuters, London, 3rd] Moscow Radio said: Kalinin was one of the most outstanding creators of the Communist Party and the Soviet state. He resigned from the post of Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Committee on March 19 this year due to poor health, and he was succeeded by Shvernik. Kalinin has the nickname of Kremlin Peasant. He began to learn the alphabet from a soldier at the age of ten. In 1898, he became a member of the Social Democratic Party, which later became the Bolshevik Party. After joining the party, Kalinin began his life of being arrested and fleeing. When he fled to the Caucasus, he became close friends with Chuchashvili, later Stalin. In 1923, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established, and Kalinin became the first president.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Hold a Memorial Service [Central News Agency, Shanghai] At 8:00 PM last night, Soviet overseas Chinese in Shanghai held a memorial service for Kalinin at 805 Foch Road.

<h3>New Soviet Ambassador to the United States Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Novikov, presented his credentials to President Truman today. Truman and Novikov gave speeches, mutually guaranteeing to promote relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The President declared: The United States will give prompt and sympathetic consideration to the Soviet Union's proposals to facilitate their realization, and hopes that the Soviet Union will give the same consideration to the proposals made by the United States. Former Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko has been transferred to serve as the permanent representative of the Security Council of the United Nations Organization, and his vacancy will be filled by Novikov.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Delivers a Speech Calling for a "People's Peace" Opposing Secret Cooperation Among Powerful Countries to Monopolize Peace Supporting the Current US Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Three Rivers, Michigan, 3rd] Senator Vandenberg today called for a "people's peace," warning against secret cooperation among powerful countries to monopolize world peace. Vandenberg, who accompanied Secretary of State Byrnes to the Paris Conference of Four Foreign Ministers, gave a speech on Washington Radio today for Three Rivers, saying that the Paris Conference established a US foreign policy that advocates "inviting all belligerent countries to have appropriate say in our common peace." In this respect, the Paris Conference was a success. Vandenberg also earnestly asked the Soviet Union to be tolerant in the peace treaty negotiations. Vandenberg expressed his unease at the Soviet Union's insistence on not convening a peace conference until the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and France had reached agreement on basic issues. It is said that the Soviet Union is using a veto power, which makes the entire peace mechanism more shaky. This right of the Soviet Union is within the scope of the agreement previously signed by the four powers, but history teaches us that "rights" can become "mistakes" if they are not exercised with wisdom and tolerance and are solely based on power. Although Vandenberg is a Republican, he said that he will support the current US foreign policy under any government. This policy is the greatest guarantee against any aggression by the Axis powers, and expansionism is a great threat to future peace and security. The armistice treaties currently signed with the countries concerned are not enough to end the war situation. If the peace treaty is delayed and cannot be established, it will exceed the limits of all reason and security.</p>
<h3>Stettinius Resigns, Truman Approves</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Stettinius, the US representative to the United Nations Organization, has resigned, and President Truman approved it today. It is said that during the meeting at the White House today, he accepted it because Stettinius was very determined to leave. The White House then issued a letter from the President to Stettinius, hoping that everything he decides to do will go smoothly. Stettinius, the former Secretary of State, has been dissatisfied for several months because he has been playing a relatively unimportant role in the United Nations Organization, so he had long planned to leave.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Stettinius will still attend and participate in the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue tomorrow until the President appoints a successor representative before he resigns.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] All parties in the United States speculate that the successor to Stettinius will be Wright, the current US representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations Organization. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davies are also possible successors.</p>

<h3>2 Million Japanese Missing in Soviet-Occupied Areas It is Difficult for Outsiders to Explore the Inside Story of the Soviet "Iron Curtain"</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese government's report, the whereabouts of the Japanese in the Soviet-occupied areas at the end of the war are still unknown. Among them, there are about 1 million Japanese overseas Chinese, and about 600,000 to 700,000 of the Kwantung Army. The Japanese government also has no way to report on the situation of the Japanese in Korea, Kunashiri Island, and Etorofu Island after the surrender. A senior officer of the General Headquarters said: The "Iron Curtain" erected by the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe cannot be broken, and the situation in Asia is the same. Recently, when Japanese diplomats returning to China from the Soviet Union passed through Siberia, they saw some Japanese working along the railway.</p>

<h3>Invasion, Massacre, Disruption of Order: Japanese War Crimes Shocking, Chief Prosecutor Reads Indictment in Court, International Tribunal Adjourns to Resume Hearing on the 13th</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 4th) The Far East International Tribunal convened this morning at 9:30 AM to hear Chief Prosecutor Keenan's public statement of the indictment's intent. General Zhan Jian, Commander of the Chinese Occupation Forces in Japan, who came to Japan to discuss occupation work with MacArthur, also attended the court to listen. Before Keenan read the indictment, Chief Defense Attorney Kiyose proposed that the Japanese translation was incomplete and hoped that the prosecution team would provide a complete translation. Presiding Judge Webb did not allow Kiyose to continue speaking, stating that this was not a reasonable motion and should be stopped immediately. Upon hearing this, Keenan smiled towards the defense counsel and continued to read the indictment, which was 15,000 words long, eloquently worded, and accused the defendants of destroying democratic systems and people's freedom, showing no respect for humanity, and arbitrarily establishing a so-called new order to replace it, massacring and enslaving millions of people. (The following is a United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Forming Cliques and Launching Aggression Keenan also stated that this trial is not an ordinary trial, but part of a battle to preserve the culture of the entire world from being destroyed. This threat of destruction does not come from natural forces, but from the meticulous planning of individuals. These people form cliques and seem to want to bring about the end of the world under their crazy ambitions of domination. Each of these defendants now in the dock shares responsibility for murder and robbery, which is part of Japan's eighteen-year plan of aggression in the Far East and the Pacific. A very small number of people in the world, including these defendants, monopolize the law and want to force humanity to obey their personal will. They declared war on civilization, created their own rules, and determined various events themselves. The defendants intended to destroy democracy, so they colluded with the Nazis in an attempt to establish a new order. Japanese aggressors jointly planned, prepared, and launched aggressive wars against democracy with Hitler's party members. The defendants murdered and suppressed millions of people, slaughtered the elderly and children, even eliminated entire societies, and regarded treaties and agreements as waste paper. This trial may be one of the most important trials in history, of great significance to the representatives of the eleven countries present, whose governments govern more than half of the world's population.</p>
<p>Clearly Stating the Trial's Goals This trial is also of equal importance to other countries and the future generations of every nation, because this kind of trial can have a far-reaching impact on world peace and security. At the beginning of this trial, the person presiding over the trial should clearly state its goals. Our broad purpose is to implement the rule of law, and its specific goal is to do everything possible to prevent the scourge of aggressive war. Defendants Tojo Hideki and his group, under strict surveillance, sat in the courtroom converted from the former Army Ministry building, listening to the translated indictment. Keenan continued, this group's conspiracy was to allocate and control East Asia, and eventually the whole world. Keenan then listed the various crimes, saying that initiating murder is by no means consistent with justice and law. Murdering one million people is no less a crime than murdering one person. Swearing to uphold the laws and institutions of a country cannot exempt one from punishment, nor can the war that sacrificed the lives of millions of people be recognized as an "incident," nor can the promotion of national policy interpreted by these individuals be recognized as legitimate. The defendants should know that the war they planned would only result in the destruction of all human life. If it is said that punishing individuals who bring civilization to the brink of extinction is illegal, then justice itself becomes a joke. The defendants argued that even if it is proven that they participated in conspiracies to promote open or covert wars of aggression, there is no power in the world that can bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Citing Legal Principles to Prove Crimes Keenan accused the defendants of wickedly planning and launching a war against the United Nations, and hundreds of illegal acts since Japan's aggression against Manchuria are equally guilty. Keenan responded to the defense's accusation of legal qualification, saying that the victorious nations have the right to bring the warlords and politicians of defeated Japan to justice. This trial is not intended as revenge, but to prevent the scourge of aggressive war. Keenan also cited legal grounds to prove that the eleven Allied nations have the special right to prosecute war criminals, and requested that aggressive war be regarded as a crime according to international law, both now and in the past. To reach this conclusion, two facts must be based on: first, there must be international law on this matter; second, according to this international law, this matter should be a crime. Determining this fact, recognizing and legally declaring these two principles by this court and the Eastern Military Tribunal here as an integral part of international common law, is truly a historical innovation.</p>
<p>After today's adjournment, the International Tribunal will postpone the hearing until the thirteenth of this month.</p>
<h3>The Court Permits Two Criminals, Matsuoka and Okawa, to Seek Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>(United Press, Tokyo, 4th) The Far East International Tribunal today allowed defendants Matsuoka Yosuke and Okawa Shumei to seek medical treatment but rejected their requests for exemption from trial. Matsuoka was ordered to be detained in the judicial prison, while Okawa was detained in the psychiatric ward of Tokyo Imperial University. According to the doctor's report, Okawa's mental state is extremely deranged, and Matsuoka's physical strength is weakening.</p>

<h3>Radar Can Ensure Weather Forecasts Are Infallible</h3>
<p>(United Press, London, 4th) British weather forecasters announced today: "We have begun to use 'radar' to detect storms 200 miles away, so if it is going to rain, we can predict it ten hours in advance with complete accuracy. Moreover, the short waves emitted by 'radar' are reflected back when they encounter rain, which can be used to record the direction, speed, and density of storms. Further research will soon enable us to predict rain three days in advance with complete accuracy."</p>

<h3>Family Members Come to Listen to the Trial, Hirota Sheds Tears</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 4th) When the Far East International Tribunal opened today, when the judges entered the court, the bailiff loudly shouted "Quiet, stand up," and the judges took their seats one by one. At this time, Hirota, known for advocating the so-called three principles towards China, took the opportunity to frequently look at his family in the Japanese special audience seats. When the local official shouted "Sit down", he still stared without moving. After the captain of the military police forced him to sit down, he could not help but shed tears. Tojo hurriedly signaled him to pay attention. Hirota took out a handkerchief to wipe away his tears, looking dejected.</p>

<h3>Important Resolutions of Housing Allocation Meeting: Decide to Re-Allocate German Overseas Chinese's Abandoned Houses, Nine Agencies Given Priority for Twenty-Eight Houses, Some Applicant Agencies Should Re-Fill Detailed Forms</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) The Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies held its ninth committee meeting in the City Hall conference room at 3 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu served as chairman, with Deputy Director He Dequi, and Huang Boqiao, committee members Liu Gongyun, Xu [], Cha Liangjian, and others all in attendance. After the committee members discussed the results: (1) In view of the fact that some agencies applying for housing have not filled in the number of returnees, the number of housing needed, and the number of inhabited houses in detail according to the prescribed form, making it impossible to uniformly review and allocate. It was decided that all agencies that have not filled in the details should be given a deadline of one time, and those who do not act will not be allocated housing by the committee, and those who do not report after the deadline will also be cancelled. Those who have already occupied the houses will be ordered to move out, and if any floating or false reports are found, they will be transferred to the competent officials for strict punishment. The application letters that have been reviewed and decided not to be allocated housing will be answered one by one. (2) In order to expedite the allocation of housing, several empty houses that have been found will be allocated to several agencies that urgently need housing. The following were approved: Higher Court 6 (Ruikang Li 31, 32, 65, 110, C58, etc.), Jianghai Customs 3 (Zhe Xing Li 32, 108, 191), Social Affairs Department National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office 1 (Zhe Xing Li 201), Central Propaganda Department International Propaganda Office 2 (East Chang'an Li 28, 29), Shanghai Municipal Government 1 (East Chang'an Li 49), Ministry of Economic Affairs Equipment General Warehouse 3 (Gonghe Li 7, 32, 45), Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department 3 (Yuqingfang 7, 29, 77), Secretary of the President of the Song Dynasty 3 (Yuqingfang 106, 113, 158), Shanghai District Court 6 (Yuan Maoli 36, 38, 42, 43, 56, 57), (3) The houses allocated by the committee were originally limited to the private property lived in by Japanese overseas Chinese. Now that German overseas Chinese in Shanghai will be repatriated one after another in the near future, the houses rented by these German overseas Chinese are mostly located in the central and western districts, and the buildings are quite tidy. It is now also decided that the German overseas Chinese Management Committee will open a clear list and transfer it to the committee for unified casting and distribution. As for the detailed measures, an emergency meeting will be convened at 3 PM tomorrow (6th) for discussion. However, German overseas Chinese private property is still handled by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3>Decision to Investigate and Suppress Landlords Demanding Gold Bars</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental and Management Committee, it has provided mediation on rental disputes between landlords and tenants. After Mayor Wu took office, he was determined to suppress the unreasonable method of topping houses with gold bars. According to the person in charge of the committee, personnel have been sent to investigate the matter of landlords demanding gold bars. However, due to the limited manpower in the committee, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate and report any such incidents that occur so that they can be investigated and prosecuted, and please ask the local court and military police authorities to assist in the execution. On the active side, the municipal government hopes that citizens can build houses as soon as possible and encourage construction. It is even better for landlords to build their own houses, otherwise, citizens will be allowed to borrow land to build houses, and banks are expected to provide loans or investments to reduce the housing shortage. At the same time, it is planned to investigate the actual number of houses in the city and allocate them according to the population. Those with a small population and many empty houses will be forced to rent them out. According to the person in charge, the housing shortage in the city is still caused by human factors, so they are extremely willing for tenants to report voluntarily. After the committee verifies the report, in addition to ordering the landlord to return the gold bars, they will also rent the house to the tenant at a reasonable price.</p>
<h3>Time to Send German Overseas Chinese Back is a Matter of Time, Technicians May Be Allowed to Stay Temporarily</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) How to send German overseas Chinese in Shanghai back to their country has attracted much attention from China and foreign countries. According to a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in principle, China and Germany are still in a state of war, and German overseas Chinese should be regarded as enemy overseas Chinese and sent back to their country as a whole. However, after being included in the list of those who should be evacuated, German overseas Chinese often put forward various reasons to request to stay in China. It is not known that the reasons and proof are legal issues, and today's evacuation of enemy overseas Chinese is a political issue, so even if they put forward various reasons and evidence, the Chinese government does not need to consider them. However, our country has always advocated generosity and also wants to retain some technicians to help us build, so the proposed evacuation lists have been submitted to the department for detailed assessment before making a decision. This list includes more than a thousand German overseas Chinese, but the date of evacuation and the evacuation theory have been formally denied by the spokesperson. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government's German overseas Chinese Management Committee息: The list of German overseas Chinese to be evacuated back to their country is decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the committee is only responsible for execution. Yang Zhixiong, the former director of the committee, has resigned from the war, and the newly appointed director, Shen Naizheng, has personally taken over on June 1.</p>
<h3>The Foundation of New Buildings Should be Strengthened to Avoid Subsidence</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) Some skyscrapers in the city have slight tilting or subsidence phenomena due to their location on the riverbank or low-lying areas. According to the construction magnate Tao Guilin, these high-rise buildings are all made of cement and steel, so there is an impact. The degree of subsidence has reached its peak and will not sink further. In the future, according to the terrain of Shanghai, the highest building can still be built with about 20 floors. However, the upper-level materials should use light and strong materials, and the foundation should be strengthened and increased to avoid subsidence. As for the construction of residences, although the construction materials are generally available, the sanitary equipment and appliances still need to be ordered from abroad, and the city's existing equipment is insufficient to meet the demand, so the date of construction must be determined after the sanitary equipment is enriched.</p>

<h3>The Litigation Fee for the Guangzhao Guild Case is More Than One Million, Request for Litigation Relief Requires Additional Submission</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) Because Wen Niyongyao arbitrarily sold public property, the Shanghai Guangzhao Guild specially filed a deed with the court to sue Wen and Qiantai Commercial Bank, Tongyi Real Estate Company, Da'an Industrial Co., Ltd., Da Zhonghua Match Company, and Zhang Tonghe, etc., requesting confirmation that the sale and purchase of land was invalid and revoked the deed.

The plaintiff claimed that the Guangzhao Guild is a public welfare organization, so it applied for litigation relief. The court ordered to submit another application and make a ruling, and the case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Property Leasing Tax Rate Reduced After Modification, Sales Tax Still Levied According to Previous Regulations</h3>
<p>The Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance is actively collecting property "leasing" and "sales" taxes. The reporter was recently told by the person in charge of this tax item: "Property leasing tax" is levied on the leasing of houses, godowns, docks, warehouses, fishing grounds, machinery, ships, automobiles, and other categories. Taking the real estate item as an example, there are more than 700,000 buildings in the city, so the collection work is very heavy. The property leasing tax rate for the first half of this year is still in accordance with the old tax law, with a maximum of 80% and a minimum of 10%. Recently, the tax law has been announced by the Ministry of Finance and included in the fourth category of the new income tax law, and the tax rate has also been modified and reduced, with a maximum of 30% and a minimum of 10%. It can be implemented in the second half of this year. As for the "property sales tax", sales tax can be levied on the income from the sale of land, houses, warehouses, docks, forests, and machinery. For example, automobiles are based on the sales and transfer registration form of the Public Works Bureau, and ships are based on the transfer form of the ship registration certificate issued by the Shipping Administration Bureau. Houses are based on the land ownership certificate obtained from the government. The tax rate is levied at a maximum of 50% and a minimum of 10% in accordance with the old law. In addition to the free declaration by the bureau team a few days ago, the ten district offices in the city have also conducted a general survey to avoid tax evasion.</p>
<h3>First Dragon Boat Race After Victory in Huangpu Beach, Light Songs and Wonderful Dances, Watching the Boat Girls Compete, Gongs and Drums Beating, Cheers Roaring</h3>
<p>The ancient Dragon Boat Festival set off a wave of revelry on the Huangpu Beach. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the Bund area was crowded with people, many of whom brought their elders and children and came from afar. They all gathered in the Bund Park and the Waibaidu Bridge to gamble on the dragon boat race. After the bell rang twice, twelve dragon boats were seen slowly sailing north from the Nanshi River. Each boat had about 20 people, sitting on both sides in an orderly manner, flying like arrows. There was also one person on the bow of each boat performing a grass skirt dance, playing games such as dragonflies, singing light songs and dancing wonderfully, high-spirited and cheerful. Eleven of the boats in front were all men, and those following behind were all women, heavily dressed and beautifully revealed. When the dragon boat team arrived near the Suzhou River, the sound of drums and gongs floated across the river. The audience suddenly cheered. After the dragon boats paraded in front of the audience for several times, they went one after another to Yangshupu. The cheers of this first Dragon Boat Festival after the victory still echoed on the Xiepu River, lasting for a long time.</p>

<h3>生生 Pasture Manager Shen Wanling Refuses to Accept Appeal The Supreme Court Discovers Further Doubts Remanding for Retrial and Re-judgment Fake Councilor Yin Ding Yi Bitterly Proclaims Innocence Old Mother, Wife and Children Embrace and Weep Profusely</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shen Wanling, manager of the Sheng Sheng Pasture (son of Shen Jiu Cheng), was accused by all the employees of the pasture of providing resources to the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, and the High Court sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. The defendant refused to accept the appeal, and the accusers also expressed dissatisfaction, submitting a request for retrial. The Supreme Court has completed the review of the case files, discovered further doubts, and remanded the case for a new trial. The case will be reopened for debate in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court soon, with a re-judgment scheduled.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court heard several cases of traitors, all of which were adjourned for further hearing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Shengwu, 50 years old, from Baoding, Hebei, graduated from Beiping Republic University. In November of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he led more than 20 political workers to work in Yiqiu Village, Yuan County, where he was captured by the enemy and immediately turned traitor. He successively served as a councilor of the pseudo-Henan Province Xiantiandao Association, the pseudo-Chongming County Magistrate, and the commander of the pseudo-Chongming County Security Brigade. After the victory, he was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. The defendant still quibbled, saying: (1) He complied with the pseudo-government's orders only when he had no other choice, (2) He had sheltered underground workers and organized welfare projects beneficial to the people, (3) He organized a defense team and had "merit" in opposing the communists, (4) He requested that Lu Jiangguang, Xiluo, and three others be summoned to testify.</p>
<p>Jin Xingjian, from Jiangsu, was transferred to Kunshan, Changshu, and other districts in the spring of the 30th year of the Republic (1941) by the pseudo-Special Service Headquarters to carry out espionage work, hindering our central government's great anti-Japanese cause, spying on military and political intelligence, and benefiting the enemy. The defendant repeatedly denied the charges in court.</p>
<p>Li Wenqi, a secret agent of the Shanghai South Gendarmerie, had framed Wu Senlin, the adjutant of the Loyalty and Salvation Army. The defendant also strongly defended himself, attempting to avoid punishment.</p>
<p>Yin Dingyi, a lieutenant general councilor of the pseudo-Nanjing government, confessed that he had never actually taken office. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), his son Mao Xuan was captured and killed by pseudo-agents for underground work, and he was also arrested and released, monitored by two special agents. Later, he was appointed as a lieutenant general councilor as a means of appeasement. After the victory, he joined the Anti-Japanese War Martyrs Association and made speeches advocating strict punishment for traitors, which were resented by Lin Zhijiang and other pseudo-agents, who preemptively accused the defendant and went into hiding himself. Therefore, his arrest this time was unjust, he said. His wife brought the certificate of the Anti-Japanese War Martyrs Association to court as evidence. His old mother and three young children embraced each other and wept profusely, a truly tragic scene.</p>
<p>[Further Report] The cases of Li Xinchang, a ticket inspector of the pseudo-Central China Railway Company's Shanghai North Station, and Qiu Junlian, a protection officer of the pseudo-Gan County Nanxiang Township Office, who are suspected of being traitors, have been concluded. Qiu Junlian is scheduled to be sentenced on the 7th of this month, and Li Xinchang is scheduled to be sentenced on the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sixth meeting of the Standing Council of the Municipal Securities Industry Association was held at the association's headquarters at 4 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Yu Huancheng, the chairman of the association. There were two items on the agenda: (1) More than 100 telephone intercoms, which were taken away by the police in February of this year, have not been returned. The association believes that the resumption of securities trading is imminent and that the telephone intercoms are private property of the industry, so it has been actively negotiating on the basis of reason, striving for their prompt return. (2) With the resumption of securities trading imminent, the association, in order to express the position of the municipal securities industry and fight for the rights it deserves, has sent letters to the Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance and Economics, stating that the association is the only securities industry association in the city. Therefore, it intends to request that qualified brokers be reviewed within the scope of the association's members, based on the number of years each member has been engaged in the securities industry, academic qualifications, reputation, practical experience, etc. It is reported that the association will convene a meeting of the entire council within the week in order to discuss all matters that the industry should prepare before the resumption of securities trading.</p>
<p>Five Broker Associations to Hold Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Before the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the five exchanges in the city for gold, grains, flour, cotton cloth, and securities had a joint association. The association ceased its activities after the war. It is now reported that the Legislative Yuan will soon propose amendments to the Exchange Law, so the association has decided to convene a joint meeting soon to collect opinions and contribute to the Legislative Yuan for reference when amending the law.</p>

<h3>Government Commemorates Martyrs and Supplements Bereavement Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Military Affairs Commission, considering that the bereaved families receiving bereavement pensions lost government protection and suffered enemy and puppet oppression during the period of the occupation, has specially stipulated three measures for handling bereavement orders reissued by puppet organizations during the occupation period, in order to commemorate the martyrs and show sympathy: 1. Those who have received bereavement pensions from puppet organizations will not be reissued for the years they have already received. 2. If the original bereavement order has been cancelled and reissued by the puppet municipal government, the reissued puppet bereavement order should be submitted to the commission for verification and replacement with a bereavement order from this commission, based on which the pension will continue to be received. 3. For bereavement cases that were filed and lost before the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the bereaved family should submit the bereavement order when receiving the pension and forward it to the commission for verification and processing. The above measures have been instructed by the Military Affairs Commission to the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to investigate.</p>
<h3>Cardinal Tian Gengxin's Speech The Pope Admired Our Leader</h3>
<p>Tian Gengxin, the Chinese Catholic Cardinal Archbishop, went to Sheshan from Shanghai at 7 a.m. yesterday to hold a solemn and unprecedented Thanksgiving Mass. At noon, a banquet was held in the Zhongshan Hall of Sheshan to welcome him. During the banquet, Cardinal Tian gave a speech, stating that the Pope's promotion of him to Cardinal Archbishop shows the lofty international status of China. Among the dozens of cardinals personally appointed by the Pope this year, one is from China. When the Pope received diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Vatican, he publicly praised China and even shouted "Long live the Republic of China! Long live President Chiang!" This is an unprecedented innovation in the Holy See. All of this can be taken as clear evidence of the Pope's admiration for our country's wise leader, his sympathy for China's new construction, and his concern for China's church. The Cardinal returned to Shanghai at 6 p.m. yesterday and will attend a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu of this city tonight. He will take a special train to Beijing the day after tomorrow to meet with the President.</p>
<h3>Government and Manufacturers Cooperate to Build Bridges and Roads in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Caojiadu Bridge in western Shanghai was severely damaged. Last winter, the Shanghai Jiangnan Paper Factory, Zhongfang Yarn Factory, Da Feng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and others jointly submitted a request to the Public Works Bureau to allocate funds to repair it in a short period of time. The Tanjiadu Bridge, slightly east of Caojiadu Bridge, was initiated by Zhu Guanren and Liu Yangzhi of Chongxin Yarn Factory, who submitted a request to the Public Works Bureau for construction. Chongxin and Dingxin Yarn Factories, Dachangxin Oil Factory, and other factories donated 19 million yuan. Construction has begun and will soon be completed. In addition, Fanwangdu Road and Houma Road, inside Caojiadu Wujiaochang, have not been repaired for more than ten years, making it a difficult journey for pedestrians. Wang Tongyuan, General Manager of Zhongfang Yarn Factory, Zhao Guoliang, Factory Director of the First Factory, Yu Tifang, Factory Director of the Second Factory, Ji Qiucheng, Factory Director of China Textile Construction Company's Shanghai First Silk Spinning Factory, Zeng Haohua, Factory Director of the Dahua Flour Mill under the Grain Ministry's takeover, Wang Qinsheng, Manager of Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Jiang Rongmei, Qian Zichao, Chen Pengnian, Factory Director of the Jiangnan Paper Factory under the Ministry of Economic Affairs' takeover, and He Yaoting, Factory Director of Shunyu Oil Factory, jointly submitted a request to the Public Works Bureau to pave the road with yellow sand, gravel, and asphalt, and build sidewalks.

The Public Works Bureau has reportedly approved the request and will start construction soon.</p>
<h3>Proceeds from the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Property Exceed 250 Billion Yuan The Property of Traitors Such as Sheng Lao San Has Not Yet Been Inventoried</h3>
<p>As of the end of May, the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District had collected 254.9 billion yuan from the sale of enemy and puppet property. In May, Customs auctioned surplus warehouse materials ten times and sold them twice, totaling 2.6 billion yuan. The Central Trust Bureau auctioned eight times and sold twice, totaling 4.8 billion yuan.</p>
<p>More than 300 cases of traitor property seized by a certain military agency have been inventoried by the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau and entrusted to the Central Bank of China, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Jianghai Customs for safekeeping. It is reported that the property of Shao Shijun, Sheng Lao San, and other more than ten major traitors has not yet been inventoried. Because Shao Sheng and other traitors have a large amount of property, the property inventory of each household is said to exceed the property of all other traitors by more than 20 times. Therefore, the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau will place the inventory of this property last to show solemnity. It is expected that the inventory of all properties will be completed by the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Enemy Plane Wreckage Sold by the Pound</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Japanese planes, which have been rampant and tyrannical for eight years, harming countless compatriots in our country, have mostly become shapeless wreckage piled up in the Jiangwan Airport. Exposed to wind, rain, and scorching sun, the authorities have now auctioned off the wreckage. It is reported that it has been purchased by multiple foreign merchants and is being transported to various warehouses and open spaces for storage. According to the person in charge of a warehouse on Jinshenni Road, the wreckage will be disassembled, classified, and sold by the pound. Among them, stainless steel and aluminum sheets are more valuable. The airport authorities have first divided up some of the less damaged planes to prevent any eventuality, but there are still some engines that can be repaired and used, which will reportedly be sold to shipyards.</p>
<h3>Tailor Induces and Defiles Teenage Girl Police Discover Clues While Searching the Room</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Jin Xiuzhen, a 16-year-old woman from Wuxi, lost her parents and came to Shanghai from her hometown in January. She stayed with her cousin at No. 371, Lane 391, Jiangning Road. Through an introduction, she became a female worker at the Meihua Silk Factory on the same road, earning more than 100,000 yuan a month, which was enough to make ends meet. Yan Xiuying (18 years old), a girl who lived in Pudong, was a close friend. Last month, Yan induced her to go out and introduced her to her fellow villager Zhu Donggen (26-year-old tailor), who defiled her at the Yuanshi Yuanyuan Hotel on Jiujiang Road. One day, Zhu induced her to go to the Xinkai Road Xinzha Hotel for a tryst. While they were meeting in secret, police officers Wang Wenbin and others from the Criminal Section of the Xincheng Branch unexpectedly came to search the room. Finding their actions suspicious, they interrogated them strictly and learned the truth. They were taken to the police station together. After Jin Xiuzhen was sent to the hospital for examination, it was proven that her hymen was broken. According to the criminal law, the crime of inducing and defiling a girl under the age of 18 has been determined and will be sent to the judicial authorities today for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Unfilial Grandson Steals Cloth Kills</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yu Yaqing, the owner of the Datong Cotton Yarn store at No. 4, Chongrang Lane, Fuzhou Road, has a grandson named Wu Sheheng, 22 years old, who usually sets up a cloth stall in Longyou, Zhejiang. He came to Shanghai at 11 p.m. the night before and stayed at his maternal uncle Yu Yaqing's place. Wu was habitually extravagant and had previously borrowed 300,000 to 400,000 yuan from Yu, which had not been repaid, so Yu despised him. This time, he asked Wu to stay with Ji Minglang, the cook of the store (50-year-old from Chongming). At 5:20 a.m. yesterday morning, Wu quietly left and stole four large packages of cloth worth more than 3 million yuan, intending to move them onto a tricycle that had been hired in advance to wait outside the lane. Ji Minglang discovered this and argued with him, refusing to let him take it out. Wu became anxious and took out a sharp blade, slashing Ji's neck and shoulders several times. Ji was injured and fell to the ground, unconscious. The sound alerted Li Xinji, the lane watchman, who immediately locked the iron gate of the lane and called the police. Wu had nowhere to hide and returned to the Datong toilet to hide. When the police arrived, they finally found Wu, arrested him, and took him to the bureau for investigation. The injured Ji Minglang died after being sent to the hospital.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Firm Breaches Contract Fraud Zhongyuan Shipping Bureau Suffers Damage Lawsuit Filed with District Court</h3>
<p>The privately-owned Zhongyuan Shipping Bureau, represented by its legal agent Gao Xinmu, ordered a 3,800-ton ocean-going ship from the British firm Mollers &amp; Co. on November 28th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), intending to use it to replace the shipping lines previously under Japanese influence, sailing along the South China Sea and the Indian coast. At that time, the purchase price was set at 75,000 British pounds (equivalent to more than 60 million yuan in national currency), with a deposit of 15,000 British pounds to be paid first, 37,000 British pounds to be paid upon delivery of the ship, and the remaining balance to be paid in full within one month of delivery. Zhongyuan immediately paid the deposit of 15,000 British pounds as agreed. On December 10th of the same year, Zhongyuan received a notification from Mollers &amp; Co. stating that the ship had arrived in Shanghai and requested that Zhongyuan prepare for the reception procedures and pay the second installment of 37,000 British pounds. Unexpectedly, the foreign firm broke its promise and, after receiving the payment, used the excuse that the British wartime transportation management authorities had not approved it, and the British wartime transportation bureau came forward to transport the goods, making a considerable profit. Although Zhongyuan negotiated with the foreign firm, the other party made various excuses and ultimately did not fulfill the contract. The two parties terminated the contract on March 8th of this year, and the Zhongyuan Company suffered significant losses (the ship's entire staff, such as the captain and sailors, had been hired, and the expenses were considerable). Therefore, Zhongyuan demanded that the other party compensate for the losses of 90 million yuan, but the other party still ignored it. Zhongyuan still filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, requesting lawyers Pan Renxi, Wei Wenda, and Lu Ronggan to jointly handle the case. The district court believes that the case involves Sino-British international relations, so it attaches great importance to it and will open the trial soon. It is reported that the litigation costs paid by Zhongyuan have reached a huge sum of more than 11 million yuan, which is the largest case accepted by the Shanghai District Court after the victory. At a time when the recovery of navigation rights and the development of the civil aviation industry are being loudly promoted, it is regrettable that Chinese shipping companies have suffered such humiliation. It is reported that the shipping industry is concerned about this and will unite to support Zhongyuan.</p>
<h3>New Guangda Theater Vandalized Dissatisfaction with "Absurd General" Dozens Arrested in Two Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 9:15 p.m. last night, the New Guangda Theater on Guizhou Road was screening the silent film "Absurd General" by Chaplin. When the film was about 15 minutes from the end, the audience downstairs thought the film was too old and demanded refunds, which was echoed by those upstairs, and the order was greatly disrupted. At the same time, spectators upstairs covered the projection lens with clothing, and the situation became even more chaotic. More than 200 headsets in the theater were damaged, more than 90 chairs were smashed, and all six sets of neon colored advertisements were shattered. The advertising glass doors and windows and the large glass on the main door were mostly smashed. The total loss is estimated at more than 10 million yuan. When the incident occurred, the theater manager Han Guangyao reported to the Lao Zha Branch Bureau, and a large number of patrol teams rushed to the scene, arresting eight perpetrators. It is reported that several employees tried their best to stop the riots, but were beaten and humiliated, but the injuries were minor.</p>
<p>Conflict Outside Paradise</p>
<p>After the New Guangda was vandalized, a group of plainclothes soldiers and a small number of spectators retreated to the entrance of the Paradise of the Xianshi Company on Zhejiang Road, and there was a lot of noise. As a result, hundreds of soldiers and civilians from the Paradise also rushed down and joined the commotion. At that time, Director Shi of the Lao Zha Police Bureau rushed to the scene with a large team of police officers, and the First Patrol Team of the Garrison Headquarters also dispatched a large number of patrol teams to suppress the situation. Unexpectedly, the crowd clashed with the military police, and in the chaos, they robbed two handguns from plainclothes police officers. Therefore, the patrol team fired four shots to suppress the situation. At this time, Section Chief Lu Dagong of the Garrison Section and Team Leader Lao of the Motorcycle Team had also received the news and rushed to the scene to try their best to suppress the situation. After the incident, it was found that police officer Song Shaomei and police chief Sun Juemin were severely beaten and sent to the hospital. As for the two robbed handguns, one has been recovered, but the whereabouts of the other are unknown. More than 30 soldiers involved in the incident have been arrested.</p>

Wang immediately cried for help, and Zhang was apprehended. Zhang said: He had lived with Wang for two years. Due to discord, they broke up two weeks ago and signed an agreement; the woman had given him more than 100,000 yuan, but this amount was too small, and he demanded more, but she ignored him. Therefore, he did this out of hatred.</p>

<p>[Report from our Bengbu Correspondent] The tragic incident involving students from the Provincial Huaiyuan Middle School in Anhui being killed by the Anti-Drug Team occurred nearly a month ago, as previously reported by this newspaper. According to information from the Anhui Provincial Government, upon receiving the report at the time, the provincial government immediately dispatched He Yizhao, a section chief from the Department of Education; Shu Shuyuan, the principal of Bengbu Middle School; together with Li Mindian, the Director of the Political Department of the Eighth Pacification Zone Command; and Liao Keqin, a judge from the Military Law Office, to investigate the circumstances of the incident and comfort the families of the deceased.

However, the main culprit, the detachment's squad leader, Hu Zhonggui, fled and could not be brought to justice. The Huaiyuan Middle School was universally outraged, and the students elected ten representatives, led by the school principal Zhou Ping and Department of Education section chief He Yizhao, to go to the capital to petition the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Education. Minister Chen indicated that he would provide preferential treatment to the families of the deceased students, provide medical care to the injured, and issue a warrant for Hu Zhonggui's arrest and severe punishment. The student representatives considered this satisfactory, and they returned to Bengbu on the 26th of last month, resuming classes as normal. Thus, the tragic event came to an end. (Chao)</p>

<h3>The Future of Middle School Art Curriculum Standards</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Last month, when I published an article in this newspaper titled "A Critique of the Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards," Mr. Gu Yinting, the Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, happened to be in Shanghai on official business. He spoke with me and indicated that he largely accepted some of the humble opinions I had put forth.</p>
<p>Continuing on from elementary school education is middle school education. Since the current revision of the "Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards" is not very ideal, what is the situation with the recently revised middle school art curriculum standards? It is necessary to bring this up.</p>
<p>The "Junior and Senior High School Art Curriculum Standards" were officially promulgated by the Ministry of Education in June of the 25th year of the Republic (1936). In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), in view of the fact that art education could inspire the spirit of resistance, it was expressly ordered to increase teaching hours, with junior high schools receiving two hours per week and senior high schools receiving one hour per week. In December of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), it was revised and promulgated. If one were to compare the new and old versions, the only official change was the teaching hours, with junior high schools receiving two hours and senior high schools receiving one hour. The teaching syllabus seemed more concrete than before the revision, and more emphasis was placed on teaching the two methods of traditional Chinese painting: line drawing and ink painting. The former was the official implementation of the order from the 27th year of the Republic, while the latter was merely an adaptation to the poor material environment of the interior. Therefore, I dare say that the "Junior and Senior High School Art Curriculum Standards" have not been fundamentally revised.</p>
<p>Of course, in the process of national reconstruction, there is a need to revise the curriculum standards, and how should the "Art" aspect be revised? This is a problem that needs to be solved. First of all, it should be understood that junior high school is a continuation of elementary school, and senior high school is a preparation for university. Therefore, the "Drawing" subject in elementary schools should be restored to "Art," and the main goal should be to neglect technical training and emphasize the beautification of life. Junior high schools may as well also be changed to "Art," using the appreciation, expression, and research of art to enrich the requirements for the beautification of life. Senior high schools can generally continue the requirements of junior high school, but they should also pay attention to the preparation of artistic talents and guidance for specialized training, i.e., preparation and guidance for entering art vocational schools. If similar students are discovered in junior high schools, they should be guided to enter five-year art vocational schools for specialized training. In other words, the last year of junior high school and senior high school may tend towards the training of art techniques, and the subject name in senior high school can also be changed to "Art."</p>
<p>Secondly, middle school students' intelligence and physical strength are higher than those of elementary school students. Therefore, the teaching of the practical application of middle school art can be further emphasized, i.e., in addition to appreciation, expression, and research assignments, a "application" item can be concretely added, such as: guiding participation in various social art activities, guiding applications for various art jobs, guiding reading of art books and newspapers, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, the format of the middle school curriculum standards should be consistent with that of the elementary school curriculum standards, so as to facilitate the implementation by teachers.</p>

<h3>Pure Lodge Opera Narrative</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Madam Yin Junong really knows how to pick a place. On April 28th, for the second Kunqu Opera gathering of the Rainbow Society, she chose the Zhou family's garden on Haige Road, also known as Pure Lodge. This place is really nice. Going in along a small path lined with trees, there is a large hall, and we held our opera gathering in this hall. After putting down my "bedding" (opera scores), I took the opportunity to wander around. Passing through winding railings and small bridges, I saw the boat hall. Azaleas were in full bloom. It was already late spring; if I didn't come to enjoy them now, I was afraid the azaleas would wither. I said to Xitong, "How wonderful it would be if we could walk and sing, with the flute player following us, like the 'Pied Piper of Hamelin' in the fairy tale! Chunxiang wouldn't have to point things out artificially; nature itself would be our stage set. When she says, 'This is a crape myrtle trellis,' she can point to the crape myrtle trellis; when she says, 'These are azaleas,' she can point to the azaleas; although there are no green mountains, there are rockeries!" But they weren't quite so free and easy, and were still a bit reserved. In the end, the six ladies—Zhang Yuanhe, Zhang Yunhe (sisters), Gu Junong, Shen Zhuoru, Wang Yijian, and Fang Yingda—sang "Wandering in the Garden" together in the hall as the opening performance.</p>
<p>It was quite a coincidence that Jin Tongyin from Fudan University and his niece, Jin Chengjie, also came here with many fellow townsmen from Pinghu for a gathering. Among them, Ge Jujie was an opera friend from the Gengchun Opera Society. After Shen Zhuoru sang "The Interrupted Dream," Jujie was temporarily pulled in to sing Emperor Ming of Tang from "The Pledge of Love and Presentation of the Box," with Zhu Yaowen, the "comic relief" of Kunqu Opera, playing Yang Guifei. Next, Yingda, Yijian, and Shen Hengyi sang "A Sudden Change at the Small Feast," after which a "picnic" was held.</p>
<p>We brought beef, roasted gluten, smoked fish, jam, bread, beef tea, lemon tea, and jackfruit. The Pinghu townsmen also contributed some wine and platters. Everyone stood around the long table and ate, which had a unique flavor. During this break, I took another walk around Pure Lodge, this time venturing deeper. The air was especially fresh after the recent rain. I carefully walked across the stone bridge in my leather shoes, ascended the rockery, and almost slipped on the moss under my feet. I admired the Chinese-style garden, which, although not large, was extremely winding. I explored the secluded spots and sought out the scenic views, going straight to the top of the hill along the small path before contentedly returning the way I came.</p>
<p>When the afternoon performance hadn't started yet, Gu Zhicheng played the flute, and my sister-in-law, Cai Shuliu, and I sang "Sweeping the Flowers." Next was Gu Junong and my wife Xitong's "Pavilion Meeting." By this time, there were more and more guests. Yunhe's scheduled "Entrusting the Sword" and Yao Jilang's "Persuading to Make Up" were generously omitted, with the time allocated to allow guests from outside the society to sing as much as possible. Miss Mu Ouchu, Yi Ru, who hadn't sung opera in a long time, was invited to sing an excerpt from "Enjoying the Play." After Wang Juchuan and Wu Jichuan (the two Chuans) sang "Teasing with the Zither," Miss Liu Jingfeng sang "Questioning Her Husband," with Shuliu accompanying her. Then there was Zhou Mengxuan's "Feigning Jealousy," with Yuanhe accompanying her. After Miss Cai Linghui's "Night Flight," there was the scheduled "Broken Bridge" by Yijian, Zhuoru, Yaowen, and Peng Zhimin. The grand finale was "The Floss Pavilion" sung by Cao Zhongtao, an old opera singer from Hangzhou. He was a disciple of Yu Yaoxian, and his singing style had many gliding notes, much like Western opera singing. Even so, there were still many guests who didn't get a chance to sing, such as Madam Wang Baoqiu, Madam Pan Fangren, Madam Zhu Xizhen, Madam Ru Yiqin, and Mr. Zhao Zenghe, Mr. Liu Yunmei, Mr. Zhu Dingyi, and Mr. Mao Lianbo, who didn't get the opportunity to sing. It was truly regrettable.</p>
<p>This day could be said to be the Rainbow Society's grand gathering. We only have fifteen core members currently in Shanghai, but unexpectedly, the number of people who signed in was already fifty-one. The "Flute King" Xu Baiqiu also played the flute for us. There were also two Americans—Marshall and Moore—who honored us with their presence. Adding the twenty Pinghu townsmen and dozens of students from Datong University, there were at least over a hundred people listening to us sing, both inside and outside the hall (some sitting on stone benches, some on the other side of the river). This gathering of a hundred people was not announced beforehand, and some were even strangers. They happened to be strolling in the garden and also heard Kunqu Opera, which they don't usually get to hear. You could say it was a kind of fate. We were all very happy and said that Madam Yin Junong had chosen a good location.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of a Large Influx of Foreign Films into Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>There are over forty movie theaters in Shanghai, and almost all of them are now showing foreign films. The daily income of foreign film companies is estimated to be around 40 to 50 million in national currency, which amounts to over 1.5 billion per month. This staggering wealth is constantly flowing out of the country, which is truly alarming! However, this 1.5 billion is only for Shanghai. Adding the financial drain given to foreign film companies by movie theaters in other major cities, such as Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, etc., it is at least over 20 billion. In other words, the total amount of money flowing out of the country due to foreign films is around 30 to 40 billion. Think about it: China's economy, after eight years of war, is already devastated, with people struggling to survive and resources depleted to the extreme. Yet, after the victory, even more money than during the war is flowing to foreign countries. How can we not expect our national currency to continue to inflate at an accelerated rate, prices to soar, resources to be depleted, speculation to run rampant, and the gap between rich and poor to widen? Although we cannot blame the recent economic panic in China entirely on the large influx of foreign films, we cannot fail to quickly find a way to plug this huge loophole.</p>
<p>There are two ways to plug this loophole: active and passive. Actively, we should quickly produce Chinese-made films. The call to quickly produce Chinese-made films has been going on for more than half a year, but not a single film has been produced. There are many reasons for this: first, personnel issues—the distribution of various film studios has not been completely resolved to this day, so production cannot begin; second, technical issues—the machinery and equipment have become old and unusable due to the war, and new ones need to be purchased from foreign countries as soon as possible, but there are problems with both finances and time, so the matter has been delayed until now without a solution. I hope that the various studios will be returned as soon as possible and that you will stop fighting and snatching from each other. I hope that the film companies will send people to foreign countries to purchase machinery and all equipment as soon as possible and that you will no longer hesitate and waver. Quickly producing films is a rescue effort, and we should abandon our personal interests and make every effort to sacrifice for the economic future of the country. The relevant authorities should fulfill their supervisory responsibilities and urge them fairly and impartially.</p>
<p>On the passive side, we should severely crack down on frivolous foreign films and not issue licenses. The number of films imported each month should be limited to a few at most. The tariffs on films should be increased. The percentage of revenue split with film companies should be reduced. This requires the responsible parties of various movie theaters to unite and, together with the government, engage in serious negotiations with foreign film companies. We are willing to use not showing foreign films as our last weapon.</p>
<p>Whether active or passive, we should have the greatest determination, prepare for the greatest sacrifices, and move forward bravely, no longer being timid, advancing and retreating, hesitating and wavering, and missing the opportunity. If everyone is willing to put the public interest first and their personal grudges last, any problem can be solved, and there will be a way to succeed in everything.</p>
<h3>Mountain City Love</h3>
<p>— Ke Di</p>
<p>I weave a basket of emotions with hazy recollections and fervent memories, placing it before the face of the calendar during this springtime of celebrating victory. Calculating the days of separation from within my meditations, the ethereal, scattered dream shadows surge and swirl within my mind.</p>
<p>The first thing that leaps into my memory is the mountain city nestled between the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. Though it abounds in rugged roads and ramshackle houses, and lacks the glamorous façade and irresistible allure of a modern metropolis, I still yearn for it with great fervor! For it endured unspeakable suffering, and within its suffering, I spent arduous days; it rose from destruction with indomitable spirit, and within its rebirth, I forged a strong will; it nurtured the resolve to resist until the end, and within its resolve, I now witness the glorious victory with my own eyes upon the lands once lost!</p>
<p>Besides all this, it was also where precious historical traces of life and the warmth of friendship were gathered.</p>
<p>I remember several times, taking advantage of the setting sun, climbing hundreds of stone steps from Lianglukou, then walking along the dusty highway, wandering beneath the majestic Fuxing Pass (formerly known as Futuguan, the site of the Central Training Corps); and following the winding mountain road down, lingering on the banks of the Jialing River, listening to the boatmen's loud songs as they pulled the ropes, each sound piercing the tranquil sky; I relived the childhood games there, using enthusiasm to turn back the years, becoming a child full of innocence, chasing and throwing oval-shaped pebbles on the beach with my playmates. There were also the moments of sitting in the Nan District Park outside of Nanjimen, gazing at the lights on the South Bank, flickering like twinkling stars; the overlooking from the Kaixuan Bridge, watching pedestrians climb the towering stone steps as if ascending a perilous blue sky…</p>
<p>In those days of hardship, I felt the preciousness of friendship more keenly and learned to cherish it, especially with young companions, who, amidst the instability of wandering, tribulation, and the threat of death, could more easily open the river of hearts and evoke resonance. Therefore, in teahouses with the dim glow of triangular tung oil lamps illuminating complex and unfamiliar faces, we often gathered around square tables, drinking Tuo tea, our spirits lifted by expansive, unrestrained conversations and laughter that drowned out the pain and sorrow. Most unforgettable was the Lunar New Year's Eve of one year, when several homeless young people gathered at an inn near Huixian Bridge, pooling the money each had earned to buy a sumptuous afternoon tea, replacing the clear tea with rich, dark, steaming coffee, drinking, talking, and laughing until dawn. The next morning, New Year's Day, we stepped on a layer of pristine snow, rare in the mountain city, each counting our footprints as we set out on our respective journeys home. Enthusiasm not only drove away fatigue but also made us feel the preciousness of life even more, forgetting in our hazy sleepiness that the years spent in the mountain city had been a series of years tormented and manipulated by the black hand of war!</p>
<p>The mountain city I had cherished for several years is now far away with the victory. Who can be sure when the day of reunion will come? Yet I cannot forget the piece of earth I once trod, though rugged, scattered with fragrance; I cannot forget the place where the turbid waters of the Yangtze and the clear waters of the Jialing reflected each other, upon which I adorned my life's journey with laughter and tears. First, I wish to send a sincere longing from afar, wishing her well since our parting!</p>

<h3>Strawberries</h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>One year, I once cultivated a good plot of land, prepared to grow strawberries, but ended up not finding the saplings. Another year, I painstakingly planted them well, but ended up harvesting nothing at all, except for seeing a few withered and weak little leaves.</p>
<p>However, selfishness is human nature. Because of this, my love for them has increased. Although in terms of color, fragrance, and taste, they have nothing particularly special, every year, during strawberry season, I can't help but buy a few.</p>
<p>Every time I read Western novels, there are many descriptions of strawberry picking, which further increases my envy. We have to buy a few strawberries from the fruit shop, unlike them who can freely pick them in the wild. How can this not be tempting?</p>
<p>However, because of this, their status has also become more noble. If we also had them everywhere, perhaps they wouldn't be so precious and cherished!</p>

<h3>Double Flight (45)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>When Madam Mo saw Zhang Xian arrive, she quickly slipped away. This was a rule Zhang Xian had set in advance: no idle people were allowed to be present during opera instruction.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian called Lihua and Liyun to his presence, giving each of them an opera script. Lihua took hers and stood to one side. Liyun looked at it with small eyes, reciting in a low voice with great interest:</p>
<p>"Complete Edition: Arrest and Release Cao..."</p>
<p>"What? Have you not studied? Xiaoyun!" Zhang Xian asked, widening his eyes in surprise. Then, pointing to the opera script, he corrected, "The word is not 'arrest,' but 'capture'!"</p>
<p>"I only recognize a few characters," Liyun replied frankly.</p>
<p>"And you? Xiaohua!" Zhang Xian turned to ask Lihua.</p>
<p>Hua flipped through a few pages of the opera script, nodded, and said nothing.</p>
<p>"Alright, then! You should first look at the characters I circled in red. If there are any you don't recognize, come ask me, and I'll tell you." Zhang Xian said, quietly glancing at Lihua. He thought to himself: This child's temper is indeed not small. Turning back to Liyun, he said: "Since you don't recognize the characters, just follow me and recite, but you must remember it firmly and recite it back to me tomorrow. If you can't recite it, I will punish you."</p>
<p>Liyun responded with a sound.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian began by teaching Liyun, from spoken lines to singing. He taught her with dramatic gestures, tapping the beat on the table with his fingers. He had Liyun learn the role of Chen Gong in "Capturing and Releasing Cao." It is said that starting to learn male roles always begins with "Capturing and Releasing Cao" because it is easy. However, Liyun was indeed not clever enough; whether it was the spoken lines or the singing, she had to be taught each sentence three or four times before she could learn it even slightly accurately. This not only made things difficult for Liyun but also for Zhang Xian. Later, Zhang Xian became impatient and had to stop at a small passage, telling Liyun to practice on her own and then come back for more teaching to Lihua.</p>
<p>Lihua had already read half of the opera script. This was "Yutang Chun" ("The Story of Su San"), and although she also did not recognize some of the characters, she became interested in the story. She did not follow Zhang Xian's instructions to only look at the characters circled in red; she read all the characters, even those that were not circled.</p>
<p>"Xiaohua, are there any characters you don't recognize?" Zhang Xian stood up, stretched, took a sip of water, and then pulled Lihua over, saying.</p>
<p>"No." Lihua solemnly shook off Zhang Xian's hand and answered him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian encountered another hurdle. He sat down awkwardly, saying to himself in admiration, "Indeed, she comes from a good background. At such a young age, she already knows how to be polite."</p>
<p>"Then, you should also do like Xiaoyun did just now: I say a sentence, you say a sentence; I sing a line, you sing a line; and you must learn from me with the same tune and rhythm, beat by beat. When learning, you must carefully listen to how I speak; you say it the same way; how I sing; and you also sing it the same way. After we're done, tomorrow you will recite it all over again, exactly the same as how I taught you today. If you make a mistake, you will be punished." Zhang Xian said with a hint of threat, thinking: If Lihua doesn't know how, he can use punishment to subdue her stubbornness.</p>
<p>At first, Lihua couldn't open her mouth no matter what. She looked at Zhang Xian's strange gestures and expressions, finding them both annoying and hateful. No matter how much Zhang Xian said and sang, she simply refused to follow him. Zhang Xian became anxious and shouted.</p>
<p>"My young lady! Can you please open your golden mouth?"</p>
<p>Lihua finally couldn't resist any longer and had to open her mouth shyly in a low voice. This first sound surprised Zhang Xian, because not only was it accurate, but it was so good that it sounded like someone with experience. The tune was loud and melodious, her pronunciation was clear, and her delivery was fluent. Compared to Liyun, there was a world of difference.</p>
<p>"Suffering!" After Lihua cried out in a trembling voice of sorrow and despair, she then cried "Hey, ya..."!</p>
<p>This cry was precisely the mournful sound that Lihua's heart wanted to call out; this weeping was precisely the grief she wanted to vent! She cried very naturally without any affectation. She cried even more naturally! She forgot that this was a play; she forgot that she was crying out in the guise of Su San! She only felt that what she was expressing now was herself. At this moment, she happened to have a belly full of bitterness and a heart full of grievance; so she cried out, she wept! She mixed the play and life together, and she shed real tears!</p>
<p>"Xiaohua, this is a play! There's no need to worry about the ancients." Zhang Xian patted Lihua, saying. He mistook Lihua for being moved by the play. "Now, follow me and learn to sing again." After speaking, he cleared his throat and began to sing in a low voice. After singing, he told Lihua: "This is called Erhuang Yaoban, remember! This is Su San's first piece of singing after she comes onstage."</p>
<p>Lihua said nothing, mechanically following Zhang Xian sentence by sentence. Although it was not as natural as before, the tragic atmosphere of this past tune could still match her current mood, so the singing was still beautiful. She almost didn't need Zhang Xian to teach her any sentence a second time. Especially in the spoken parts, Zhang Xian's pronunciation was not as clear as hers. Because she had a pure Beijing accent, crisp and delicate. In addition, because she knew how to read, it was especially easy for her to learn.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian also taught Lihua a section of Fan Erhuang Manban, which was considered a smooth completion of the first day's lesson. Finally, he told her that when they learned stage movements in the afternoon, she would also have to memorize the lyrics and spoken lines she had just learned because the stage movements had to match the lyrics and spoken lines. Then Zhang Xian called Liyun over again and asked her:</p>
<p>"Xiaoyun, have you practiced enough at this time?"</p>
<p>Liyun did not answer because in fact, she had only been paying attention to Lihua just now and had completely forgotten to practice her own part. Her impression of the singing passages and spoken lines that she had learned was already very vague, so she was very embarrassed at this time.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian had no choice but to teach Liyun again from beginning to end. Finally, he warned her:</p>
<p>"If you still can't do it tomorrow, you will be beaten!"</p>
<p>Liyun puffed up her small eyes and made a sound "哼". She was very disappointed in her heart: she originally thought that learning opera was fun, but she didn't know it would be so difficult. Moreover, Zhang Xian wanted to "beat" her at every turn, which made her very frightened. She thought about not learning, but she was afraid that Auntie Weng wouldn't allow it, so she couldn't help but resolve to work hard. But if she did, she would have no time to play at all, so she couldn't help but get annoyed.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Shi Yulou began teaching them stage movements. This was more interesting for Liyun, who liked to move her hands and feet, jumping and hopping. However, because she moved too much, and she wasn't familiar with the lyrics and spoken lines, the two couldn't coordinate, making Shi Yulou both amused and annoyed! He had to teach her haphazardly.</p>
<p>When it was Lihua's turn, she was still shy about raising her hands and feet at first. When she was forced to, she moved rhythmically and orderly according to Shi Yulou. Because she was clever and learned quickly, Shi Yulou taught her more energetically and earnestly.</p>
<p>After that, Lihua and Liyun learned and practiced in this way every day. In less than half a month, Lihua had learned the entire "Yutang Chun", but Liyun had only learned one-third of the entire "Capturing and Releasing Cao". Usually, Lihua also helped Liyun teach her to recognize the characters in the lyrics and spoken lines. But unfortunately, Liyun's talent was limited, and she could never catch up with Lihua's speed. Therefore, she was often slapped on the hand as punishment. Lihua had also been beaten, that was when she was too lazy to speak, or when she was annoyed with Zhang Xian and deliberately disobeyed him, she had been beaten a few times by Zhang Xian.</p>

<h3>Gold Certificate Transactions Sparse Yesterday, Government Bonds Suspended Due to Special Circumstances, A Certain Bull Market Crushes Over a Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold certificate market was even more erratic, its movements entirely dependent on how positions were adjusted. There was no sign of improvement in the morning, and overnight bulls continued to sell at high prices, gradually declining from around 1.8 million. Around 10 o'clock, it was around 1.79 million. The Bank of China allocated over a hundred strips at a price of 1.795 million. After the entry, the money market eased, and actual sales were still strong. Near noon, it rebounded to 1.82 million and then stabilized slightly. The afternoon saw some flatness, and transactions were sparse due to the holidays. The result showed little change from the previous closing. Gilt was 192,000, sycee silver was 1,900, silver dollars were slightly stable, the underground discount rate for money was slightly evened out, and the interest rate was from 1.5 to 1.8 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, US dollars, remained strong and stable, fluctuating slightly between 2315 yuan and 2335 yuan, with gold arbitrage at around 771 yuan, with some differences. It was slightly stable at noon, and transactions were limited in the afternoon. The result showed a slight increase of five yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were mediocre, and the result showed a slight drop in old notes. Indian exchange was 528 yuan, and Hong Kong exchange was 430 yuan with supply. US exchange was stable.</p>
<p>Government bonds were again suspended yesterday due to special circumstances. A certain firm on the seventh floor, which had purchased 1.02 million in face value bonds at high prices the day before, refused to complete the transaction, citing a difference of 1,000 yuan in the purchase price, causing the industry to be implicated and stopping public trading. As a result, all bonds had no formal trading. The C-series loan rose from 5650 yuan to 6000 yuan, resulting in an increase of over 300 yuan from the previous closing. Miscellaneous bonds had varying times, with A and B rising 100 yuan, D flat, and E falling 150. Chinese stocks continued to be weak, with hot and cold stocks reversed. Wing On Textile was at a high of 5750 yuan and a low of 5450 yuan, American Asiatic was at 4250 yuan and a low of 3980 yuan, King Fook retreated from 295 yuan to 270 yuan, New Kwong retreated from 280 yuan to 260 yuan, Kwan Hing retreated from 225 yuan to 203 yuan. Other small and medium-sized unpopular stocks rose from their lows. This was because the exchange had recently reopened, and the general sentiment was to abandon hot stocks for cold ones, with arbitrage being quite active, leading to this. Compared to the previous closing, the hot stocks Wing On Textile, American Asiatic, New Kwong, and Kwan Hing all fell slightly, King Fook rose slightly, and the colder small and medium-sized stocks, except for Wing Fung which did not change, all recovered half to one-tenth. Veteran stocks were inactive, and the market was weak. The afternoon saw fewer transactions due to the holiday. The foreign stock market continued to be mediocre, with stocks being bought and sold selectively. Generally, there were still sellers of hot stocks, while cheaper stocks had buyers, resulting in a balance. Compared to the previous closing, Ewo Silk, Union Paper, Asia Industries, Canton Wharf all saw slight declines, while Ewo Brewery and Shanghai Steel saw slight increases.</p>
<h3>The Tung Yih Godown Receipt Dispute Remains Unresolved – The Consequences of Robbing Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Due to various reasons during the period of the occupation, Tung Yih Spinning Mill had many godown receipts that had not been cleared. However, the yarn and cloth inventory covered by these receipts had already been forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes. Before the victory, they had already cleared batches of receipts, reaching settlements with the holders and paying them at a discount. Currently, there are still many holders of 16-pound coarse cloth godown receipts who have not reached a settlement. They have registered with the Cotton Cloth Industry Association and entrusted them to negotiate on their behalf. The person in charge of the association has contacted the factory multiple times, but without progress. Some of the impatient receipt holders have repeatedly questioned the factory, believing that the factory is already shipping and operating, but has not cleared the outstanding receipts, making them feel uneasy. The factory has presented documents issued by the enemy when they were forcibly purchased as a defense. Both sides are still deadlocked. According to sources from the receipt holders, the documents issued by the enemy are very vague and do not specify the type of goods, believing that the receipt holders should not bear the consequences. They also claim that some of the receipt holders are from the rear area and are completely unaware of the situation. The factory has previously stated that the forcibly purchased yarn and cloth did include all goods, as evidenced by the accountant's audit report. It is rumored that both parties will nominate responsible persons to reopen negotiations within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Coal Allocation Unattractive to Buyers – Six Reasons</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Fuel Management Committee of this city issued another batch of coal allocation for production enterprises in May, following April. The allocation price remained largely unchanged, but the recipients were not as enthusiastic as in April. The reasons are: (1) The selling price of production allocation is higher than that of merchants, and often the coal resold by merchants is cheaper; (2) Except for small retailers, the goods must be picked up in Pudong, and recipients are not clear about the quality and procedures; (3) Industrial decline and limited electricity supply. Factories in the former French Concession are not allowed to operate motors after 5 pm daily, further narrowing sales; (4) Diesel substitution is less costly; (5) The time limit for payment of the allocation is shortened; (6) Industry associations restrict member factories from reselling. Due to these reasons, it is said that the coal allocated to industries such as rubber and dyeing last month has not yet been fully collected.</p>
<h3>New British Products</h3>
<p>London, April 4 (British Information Service) – The British glass industry is about to complete many new glass products, including transparent bricks, doors, inlays, and even tow ropes. In the future, it will also supply the world with glass tables, tubes, belts, backs, arches, straps, bracelets, shoes, and boots. A manufacturer in northern England is producing the world's cheapest small car, the six-horsepower Kendall four-seater, which can travel 60 miles on one gallon of gasoline and has a speed of 60 miles per hour. The price per vehicle is £200.</p>
<h3>Wool Fabrics Made with Fruit Juice</h3>
<p>New Invention by Australian Scientists</p>
<p>Canberra, April 3 (Agence France-Presse) – This correspondent has learned that Australian scientists have recently discovered a type of fruit growing in Australia that can be used to extract a chemical atom from its juice, called "Baping," which can be used to manufacture soft and shiny silk-like wool fabrics. The textile industry here expects that this type of fabric will be produced and sold in large quantities, as light-as-a-feather clothing is most needed in tropical areas. Thanks to this chemical invention, this type of fabric can absorb and evaporate moisture, and its use will certainly be great.</p>
<h3>Flying Tiger General Chennault – Establishes Sino-American Industrial Company – Capital Reaches 100 Million Yuan – Focuses on Import and Export Business</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] This newspaper previously reported that Flying Tiger General Chennault planned to organize a company to engage in commerce. It is now known that this plan has been concretized. Its name is Sino-American Industrial Corporation, a joint venture organized by Chinese and American personnel, with a capital of 100 million yuan, shared equally by China and the United States. The American half is the responsibility of Mr. Chennault, while the Chinese half has also been fully subscribed. A promoters' meeting was held in this city yesterday, chaired by Mr. Li Mingyang. All progress plans have been agreed upon. It is said that the company is dedicated to supporting factories, revitalizing industry, improving agricultural production, assisting in transportation and sales, and increasing farmers' production, in order to fulfill the goal of building the country through industry. Its business scope is extremely broad, including (1) investment in improving rural native products and rural welfare; (2) investment and management of factories and industries; (3) investment and operation of various enterprises; (4) promotion and operation of domestic and foreign trade and transportation; (5) design of various production industries and supply of machinery and raw materials; (6) investment in various securities; (7) operation of warehouses and all trust businesses; (8) investment in other various businesses. The head office is located in Shanghai, and branch offices or offices may be established in major commercial ports. In addition to Li Mingyang, the Chinese promoters include Wang Lihang, Ren Jin, Zhu Xuefan, Xu Caicheng, Liao Gongzhu, and more than thirty others.</p>
<h3>Shirting Actively Sold</h3>
<p>No Market After Dragon Boat Festival Yesterday Yesterday was the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival. The Paradise and Cotton Cloth Association markets were open in the morning, but transactions were very few. Shirting was actively sold by northern merchants and others, and the market price rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to tight money, there were no transactions on this street, so the market price slightly decreased by 300 to 500 yuan. There were no transactions in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Shops Uniformly Renamed Money Exchange Stores</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] There are many money exchange shops in this city. Except for a few that have applied to the Central Bank and been approved to trade in foreign currencies and gold, the rest have been strictly prohibited by the Shanghai Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance from engaging in speculative transactions and trading in foreign currencies. It is now known that the Shanghai Finance Bureau, for the sake of price management, has drafted several rules, which have been agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau. In the future, money exchange shops will be uniformly referred to as money exchange stores, and must obtain a license from the Finance Bureau before they are allowed to operate.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Hog Bristle Export – Tianjin and Shanghai Production Losses, Chongqing Production Barely Covers Costs</h3>
<p>There have been continuous business transactions in hog bristle exports to the UK and the US recently. It is reported that the Sichuan Production Company sold over 1,200 boxes to the US in May for delivery in New York, priced at US$3.25 per pound for 27 combination boxes (per pound price), US$2.15 for 2-inch bristles, 15 shillings and 8 pence (purchased by an American merchant on behalf of the UK), and US$1.05 for bundles. Another 150 boxes of 27 bristles were sold to the British government last month for delivery in London, priced at 15 shillings and 8 pence. It is said that the recent New York hog bristle prices show that Tianjin's 43-box longer combination can be sold for up to US$4.00, Chongqing bristles with 27 combination boxes can be sold for US$3.25, and Shanghai bristles, due to their inferior quality, are only sold for between US$1.00 and US$2.00. Based on the current domestic prices, shipping and sales from Tianjin and Shanghai to the US result in losses, while Chongqing barely covers costs.</p>
<h3>Indian Glycerin Arrives</h3>
<p>US and Philippine Caustic Soda Export Ban</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian glycerin has arrived, causing the price of triangular glycerin to be lowered by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The market price of Indian glycerin is quoted as high as 180,000 yuan. [Another report] The inventory of caustic soda in this city is thin, and sales have been extensive. Previously, New York and the Philippines had both banned exports, and merchants in this city had secretly tried their best to buy it. Now that the US ban has been confirmed and the import of caustic soda is hopeless, it has become the target of raw material merchants. Raw material merchants consider caustic soda to be the commodity with the largest sales volume, and also the most volatile. The highest price in Shanghai was around 2 million yuan per 300-kilogram barrel, and the lowest price was only 180,000 yuan. It is also said that customers from Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have come to Shanghai to purchase. General speculation is that this round of price increases may exceed the previous peak.</p>
<h3>Exporters Hope for Reduced Export Taxes</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Karl S. Chen, manager of the merchants' Lai Wai foreign firm, recently, our country's trade with South America has gradually returned to its pre-war state. Last week, the firm had a batch of light bulbs worth US$80,000 shipped for export. The cost of each light bulb is 30 yuan, plus an export tax of 5 yuan, so not only is there no profit, but there is also a loss. Therefore, at a time when the export industry is extremely difficult, it is hoped that the government will reduce export taxes and broaden the scope of tax-free goods to encourage exports. The import taxes of countries such as the UK and the US are generally between 50% and 70%, and some are even as high as 90% or more. Therefore, it is also hoped that the government authorities will negotiate with the UK and the US to reduce them.</p>
<h3>The Dyestuff Market Varies – Basic Colors and Grounds Are Very Strong – Manufacturers Are Not Eager to Order</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The dyestuff market has seemed calm recently. De Fu Foreign Firm continues to distribute goods. The number of distributed indanthrene and direct dyes is still considerable, while vulcanized yuan is very tight. Recently, TBO yuan has been distributed. Hengxin Foreign Firm has not accepted orders for the past month or two. Its previous orders are arriving one after another, and a small amount of vulcanized yuan is also being delivered. Therefore, the yuan color market has recently turned from strong to flat. Its American goods, 693 yuan, were 900,000 yuan in early May, rose to 1 million yuan when cleared customs in mid-May, and have recently returned to 1 million yuan. Dye factories are accepting orders well, and there seems to be a positive outlook. The price increase of TBO yuan is more intense. The reason for this is that this brand has been unpopular for a long time, but recently there has been a sudden increase in demand. Therefore, although De Fu has distributed goods, the price has instead increased. It is currently standing at between 835,000 yuan, which is about 150,000 yuan higher than mid-May. NLA yuan has been almost out of stock for the past ten days, and there are no transactions on the market. It was quoted as high as 1.12 million yuan in mid-May. This brand is very good, but it seems to have been overshadowed since the American goods, 693 yuan, became popular. However, manufacturers are still willing to pay a higher price to buy it. The body of TBO yuan is still acceptable, but it is a blue-green color, and its sales are ultimately narrower. Moreover, De Fu's inventory is also not large. From a general perspective, the yuan color market seems to have a strong foundation. Bleaching powder has been fatigued since orders from foreign firms such as Xiehe and Meihe arrived. The price in early May was 200,000 yuan, but it has now fallen to between 150,000 and 160,000 yuan. Indanthrene and sunfast dyes exceeded 20 million yuan at the end of last year, but now 9 million yuan is still rarely accepted. The reason for this is not due to De Fu's large distribution, but due to the continuous arrival of American sunfast dyes. There are few of these American goods that come from Hengxin, their sales agent, but many are resales of orders placed in the interior before the victory. The exchange rate for these orders was much cheaper than it is now, so it is appropriate to sell more at a small profit. According to this situation, it seems difficult to be optimistic about sunfast blue. In the past two or three months, the dyestuff route of dye factories cannot be said to have been without improvement, but in the end, they are afraid of the price drop of foreign goods and dare not buy too much, let alone hoard them. Therefore, except for a few mainstream goods such as vulcanized yuan, where foreign firms are unwilling to continue accepting orders, a tired outlook is a common psychology. Therefore, whenever news of imported goods arriving is heard, the price is bound to fall. Sunfast blue, bleaching powder, and caustic soda are all typical examples. However, low-end and fast-selling goods can quickly trend upward again, and vulcanized yuan is also one of them. Currently, most of the goods sold by dye factories themselves are light-colored goods. The goods produced by dye factories are still concentrated in basic color and blue-colored goods. Although there are more factories operating, sales have not developed much. The silkworm season on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway has diminished in color, and acceptance is mediocre. Tianjin merchants have the impression that their buying is unfavorable due to incompatible prices, and the route to Hubei is also sluggish. The future is not optimistic, and it is said that many factories are planning to reduce work and save expenses to overcome this difficulty.</p>

<h3>Who Will Win the Third World War?</h3>
<p>— Translated and Narrated by Zuo Xi</p>
<p>From the "Second World War," it is easy to associate with the "Third World War." The recent evolution of the international situation makes people even more concerned about the arrival of the "Third World War." Indeed, many people have been talking about this matter recently. The British Labour Party's newspaper recently published an editorial stating that the Third World War is no longer just empty talk, but has the possibility of evolving into reality. It says that the Soviet Union harbors great suspicion towards the United States and Britain, and if this suspicion continues to progress at the current rate, it will soon reach the point of explosion, and once it explodes, it can instantly raze our world to the ground.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the American "International Digest" published a moving article by Charles Burns in its July issue, entitled "Who Will Win the Third World War?"</p>
<p>At the beginning, he made a definitive statement: the victor of the Third World War will not be the United States, which promotes democracy; in other words, unless the United States abandons democracy first and adopts a military dictatorship similar to Hitler's, it will certainly fail in future wars. Because in the atomic bomb war, whoever strikes first wins. Only armed nations can take such action, which is impossible for the democratic United States.</p>
<p>If the disputes between the powers today cannot be resolved through political means and must be settled with weapons, then the lineup of the two sides will be like this: the United States against the Soviet Union—the rest of the countries will join either side according to their own interests.</p>
<p>If the future conflict is an atomic war, it will be difficult to distinguish between the victor and the vanquished, just as it is impossible to distinguish between one pile of stones and another.</p>
<p>The scene of the future war is probably like this: at a high temperature of 21.2 million degrees Fahrenheit, the entire city melts into a mixture of cement, glass, and steel. Factories collapse completely, and people and machines turn into sparks in a giant cloud of smoke. One bomb explosion simultaneously kills hundreds of thousands or even millions of people and animals. People who are several miles away from the explosion site, even if they do not die today, may not be able to survive tomorrow. Strange burns will later be found on their skin, which cannot be cured, because the patients are still affected by other radioactivity: diarrhea, sore tongue, bleeding without wounds, hair loss, loose teeth that can be pulled out immediately, and the collapse of white blood cells, making it impossible to resist germs. What do scientists say about the Third World War?</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Zeng, who won the Nobel Prize, said: "The future is unpredictable. In fact, future history often cannot last long. Our technical wars are extremely terrible. If we engage in this kind of war, there will be no survivors." He also said: "Our conclusion is: when the enemy is able to freely choose the method of throwing atomic bombs, there is no effective defense against the explosion of atomic bombs." What do military experts say?</p>
<p>Army General Marshall fully acknowledges the scientists' most pessimistic arguments. In his final report to the President, he categorically stated: "The outbreak of the Third World War is like a thunderbolt attack," and predicted that this attack would be launched from afar with rockets exceeding the speed of sound. He warned that this lightning-fast attack would give the leisurely and peaceful United States no time to prepare for war. He believes that if the United States wants to defeat the enemy, it must establish strong fortresses and a peacetime-trained army of 4 million men capable of fighting immediately.</p>
<p>In theory, perhaps the United States could become the only country capable of coping with the Third World War: the United States could turn the entire country into an armed camp, and all islands into outer fortresses. The United States could send spies to infiltrate military stations in all countries. However, all of this would be difficult to pass in the democratic Congress. Only after the United States adopts a military dictatorship can there be hope for the realization of the above-mentioned possibilities.</p>
<p>In addition to this, if the United States wants to prevent the Third World War, it must follow the following path: use delaying tactics to prevent the outbreak of a future war, and elect people with the determination to promote world peace and support the United Nations organization as members of Congress. If we can delay a world war for ten or twenty years, then international cooperation will certainly be able to advance further, and perhaps a more advanced international organization than the United Nations organization can be produced.</p>
<p>In short, must mankind lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot, or will we only tend towards the path of destruction?</p>
<h3>Radar and the Moon</h3>
<p>— By D. Daez, Translated by Na Jie</p>
<p>During the Second World War, "radar" played a very important role, second only to the "atomic bomb." Warships sailing in the dark or in dense fog can use radar to detect enemy ships many miles away, and then fire cannons, which can almost be 100% accurate. In addition, radar can also be used to detect enemy aircraft and coastal defenses. As for the principle of radar usage, radar waves are first emitted into space. When the waves move forward and encounter obstacles, they will fold back and generate fluctuations in the recording device. A specially trained person can see the enemy's movements from above and immediately take appropriate measures, thereby killing the enemy. Radar accelerated the victory of the United Nations.</p>
<p>While radar has many uses in wartime, it will certainly have even greater uses in peacetime, and the future is simply unlimited. For example, recently, radar has been successfully used to detect the moon, becoming a prelude to humans further understanding the moon and even exploring the moon. On January 10, 1946, the US Army Air Station in Belmar, New Jersey, emitted radar waves to the moon on a moonlit and windy night. The distance between the Earth and the Moon is 238,000 miles. The waves moved forward at a speed of 186,000 miles per second (equal to the speed of light), and then folded back to Earth, taking 2.4 seconds. At that time, the recording device emitted a light buzzing sound, and white ripples appeared on the black recording board. From these ripples, it is possible to infer the topography and formation of the moon.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that humans have tried to explore the moon. Previously, some people advocated using searchlights to shine extremely strong light on the moon, and then using sophisticated telescopes to observe, but the results were unsuccessful. Later, some people advocated radiating radio waves to the moon, but in the airspace 30 miles above the Earth, there is an ionosphere created by sunlight, and radio waves cannot pass through it, so they fold back when they reach 30 miles, and the moon is 238,000 miles away from the Earth! Thanks to the invention of radar, these difficulties have been overcome.</p>
<p>The attempt by humans to build rockets to explore the moon has approached the point of realization from fantasy, and the success of radar detection of the moon can be said to be good news for adventurers.</p>
<h3>The Transformation of European Politics</h3>
<p>— Written by Stanley High, Translated by Jia Na</p>
<p>On July 5, 1945, a momentous event with far-reaching impact occurred in European politics. Was it the collapse of Germany? Or the surrender of Japan? Everyone knows it was not. If readers are eager to know exactly what this major event was, I can say it straightforwardly: It was the Labor Party's victory in the British election.</p>
<p>As the Labor Party came to power and the Conservative Party stepped down, amidst the comings and goings of British politics, people often mistakenly believe that Britain will henceforth lean left, and that Anglo-Soviet relations will inevitably become closer than during the Conservative Party's rule. This is because the Labor Party advocates socialism, and isn't socialism practically the fraternal twin of communism? This notion is specious, even counterproductive, so I dare say: it is a misconception.</p>
<p>The following are the views expressed by American writer Stanley High on this issue, in an article titled: "Will the British Labour Party Turn Europe Away from Communism?" published in the May issue of "Reader's Digest."</p>
<p>In my (Stanley High's) opinion, world communism and the British Labour government are on a collision course: if the Labour government succeeds, the prestige and power of international communism may gradually decline; conversely, if the leaders and policies of the Labour government fail, then the momentum of communism may expand.</p>
<p>I hold this belief for two reasons: first, because communists themselves hold this view. Since the Labor Party's moderate democratic reform policies began to take shape, international communists, in their newspapers and strategies, have revealed that the target they aim to overthrow is none other than the British Labor Party! Second, because the various changes that have taken place in European politics have already begun to confirm this point. In the nine months since the British Labor government came to power, it has not bolstered but rather weakened the power of international communism, and has restored the inherent beliefs of moderate parties in Europe that had long been losing ground.</p>
<p>The Labor Party's victory in the election and assumption of power on July 5 has had a very significant and far-reaching impact. The politically astute Dr. Noel Burg said, "The liberated nations of Europe almost immediately recognized the British Labour Party's platform as an excellent alternative to communism."</p>
<p>Since the British Labor Party came to power, six liberated European countries have held free elections. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party has not won in any of the six countries, and their gains have been far smaller than predicted by most qualified observers.</p>
<p>The transformation of European politics due to the Labor Party's success in Britain is no longer limited to Western Europe, but has begun to extend to Southern and Eastern Europe. The fact that this phenomenon is even occurring in Eastern Europe, a bastion of communism, is truly remarkable! "The Times" said, "This is the biggest political news in Europe. The rise of anti-communist forces in countries such as Hungary, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, and Yugoslavia was almost unimaginable, yet the impossible has become possible."</p>
<p>The current political trend in Europe is not just anti-communist. In fact, as the "New York Times" said, "It is a revival of democracy." European people, who had gradually lost faith in democracy, are now changing their beliefs.</p>
<p>This change in the world situation is not unexpected to international communists. Marx and Lenin have used thousands upon thousands of words to earnestly advise their communist successors that the greatest threat to communism is not unscrupulous capitalism, because capitalism itself contains elements that contribute to its own disintegration. The Communist Party's number one enemy is the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party, as well as all figures who oppose violent revolution and advocate striving for the masses through reform methods.</p>
<p>When international communists cannot prevent the rise of this movement, they try to participate in it, thereby expanding their power and, at the appropriate time, subverting it from within. For example, Lenin personally prescribed this method in order to overthrow the first British Labor government in 1924.</p>
<p>During the British elections last year, the British Communist Party had already anticipated that the Labor Party might win. In order to implement its consistent strategy, it twice requested to unite with the Labor Party, and was twice rejected. After the election, they issued a third call, and were rejected a third time. In its letter rejecting the Communist Party's request, the Labor Party said, "The experience of the past twenty-five years has made the National Executive Committee of this party deeply aware that the Communist Party's current plans and long-term goals are fundamentally different from those of the Labor Party."</p>
<p>The Communist Party's newspapers were extremely indignant because its plan failed. The American Communist Party's "Daily Worker" said, "In fact, the British Labour Party seems to have told the socialist parties of Europe: If you sever ties with the Communist Party, you are guaranteed to receive British support. This is the core of Bevin's policy."</p>
<p>Therefore, this movement led by Britain has become a major political issue for Moscow. So when Bevin and Vyshinsky met in the Security Council, in fact, they represented not only two great powers, but more importantly, two fundamentally different ways of life. The real dispute is the dispute between socialism and communism. Anyone who understands the trends of the post-war world knows that the most acute struggle of political thought at the moment is between the two philosophies mentioned above.</p>
<p>Indeed, the founding fathers of these two philosophies were both Marx's doctrines, but the biggest difference between them is that socialism has continuously inclined towards liberalism, while communism has become totalitarian in nature. The British Labor Party's victory in the election was the spark that ignited this ideological war.</p>
<p>That is why this article stated at the outset: The British Labor Party's victory in the election was a major event with far-reaching impact on European politics.</p>

<p>The United States, like other countries, is experiencing the most severe housing shortage in its history. Previously, Mayor Wyatt of Louisville, Kentucky, was ordered by President Truman to be responsible for planning a solution to the housing problem in the United States. After receiving the order, Wyatt devoted all his energy to this problem. He suggested mobilizing most of the American construction industry to build 1.7 million new homes within two years. Due to the consequences left by the failure of the American "New Deal" before the war, and the suspension of housing construction during the war, his difficult problems are numerous. People in the construction industry have loudly attacked him and his policies because he has severely restricted their 450 billion yuan construction plan, and the construction industry has therefore suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>But Wyatt disregarded everything and, with resolute measures, stipulated that only low-value houses are allowed to be built. Wyatt's plan is to build houses using six methods, and divide the houses into four grades, and predetermine the number of houses of each grade to be built according to the needs of the two years. The American construction industry has been able to meet the need for high-end houses, but the gap in building inexpensive houses is still large. Wyatt's goal is to change this situation; in other words, he hopes to reduce high-end houses and build more inexpensive houses to meet the needs of the general public. To achieve this goal, he must rely on the construction of mobile homes and other completely new and untested methods.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a cheapest and fastest construction method called "on-site construction method," which can build a large number of houses in a short period of time. The most famous architect who advocates this construction method is Bohannon of San Francisco. His method is to first build a light wooden frame on or near the open space where the house is to be built, and then put the boards, beams, pillars, floors, etc. required for the house building on it, and then use a road roller to tamp the foundation of the house, and finally use nails to nail the various ready-made wood materials together to build the house frame. In 1944, Bohannon used this method to build 700 houses near Oakland, California, with a total working time of 693 hours.</p>
<p>Wyatt believes that the "on-site construction method" and the "mobile home construction method" are two effective methods to achieve his housing construction goals. But he believes that most of the new houses will be built by thousands of traditional small-scale construction companies in the country. Therefore, he also encourages another construction method that can be adopted by small-scale construction companies. This method takes the ready-made house's important equipment—such as bathrooms, kitchens, and heating equipment—as the core, and builds the house around it. This ready-made house equipment can solve the expensive and complicated indoor equipment problems. At present, the production of this ready-made house equipment is extremely slow, but at least one large-scale industrial company is preparing for mass production. Wyatt plans to build 2.7 million new houses in two years. If this plan is successful, then the industry of building inexpensive houses will lay a foundation, and it can be promoted and developed from this. If this is the case, then not only can the housing shortage in the United States be solved, but also the housing shortages around the world may be solved easily.</p>

<p>Soon, fresh fruits such as apples and oranges can still be kept fresh weeks or months after they are picked, just like when they were just picked. The method is very simple: wrap the fruit with a special film (the thinnest is only one ten-thousandth of an inch thick). Even easily perishable apples can be kept for more than eighteen months.</p>
<p>Matches that are damp naturally cannot strike a flame, but almighty science has already solved this shortcoming. A match that has been placed in a damp room for several months, or floated on the surface of the water for twenty-four hours, can still strike a flame. Scientists have spent a hundred years researching this kind of "waterproof" match, and it has only recently been successfully completed. This new type of match has been immersed in six different solutions, and each solution applies a transparent film on the match. It was originally used by the army in humid climates and by the navy in lifeboats during the war. It will probably be available on the market in a few months.</p>
<h3>Who Is the Richest Person in the World</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>The richest woman in the United States—perhaps in the world—Wilkes, is the daughter of Wall Street tycoon Hetty Green. Her total wealth amounts to US$100.01 million.</p>
<p>The most precious part of her property is a collection of jewelry worth $20 million, including a golden helmet adorned with emerald peacock feathers, a diamond-encrusted chastity belt, and a box of unset jewels. The income she receives from her husband's estate and her own property is $5 million per year, which is more than King George VI of England's pre-war annual salary of $4.5 million. The current income of the King of England is less than this amount. She can mobilize $10 million in cash within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkes's life is very regular. She gets up early every day and eats a fairly rich breakfast (including fruits, eggs, toast, coffee, etc.), and drives to the office (a real estate company) at 10:00 in the morning to work.</p>
<p>When someone asked Mrs. Wilkes who she planned to leave her property to, she just shook her head and said nothing.</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Gambling Kingdom</p>
<h3>Monte Carlo Is Still Safe and Sound</h3>
<p>— Translated by Nan</p>
<p>There is a very small principality on the Mediterranean coast in southeastern France, which is Monaco, known as the "Gambling Kingdom." The country covers an area of ​​only 20 square kilometers, has a population of more than 25,000, has a mild climate, and beautiful scenery. It is a summer resort. The town of Monte Carlo in the country has a huge gambling company. People in Europe and even the world who love gambling all "flock to it." The eight-year world war has changed the landscape and the map. In this changeable world, what is the current situation of Monte Carlo? I think readers would like to hear about it.</p>
<p>American journalist Acheson recently visited this small "utopian" country, and afterwards published an article in "Life Magazine" describing the past and present situation of the gambling kingdom. I will excerpt the main points below.</p>
<p>The first point to tell readers is that Monte Carlo is "business as usual." Even when the war was at its hottest, and even when stray shells from air raids affected the Principality of Monaco, the casino did not hang up the "no war" sign.</p>
<p>Just like the casinos in various countries and regions all have elegant names, the Monte Carlo Grand Casino also has a falsely named nickname, called "Seawater Bath Tent." This name was taken by the founder of the casino, Brock, 80 years ago. Someone asked him why he named it so inappropriately. The old comedian said, "Isn't it just to make the customers look better?"</p>
<p>During the war, the ivory ball on the roulette wheel of the Monte Carlo Casino never stopped, but in the comings and goings, the faces of the customers have changed significantly. Although there are Germans, Italians, French, British, Americans...there are not many nobles, wealthy gentlemen, luxurious wives, and beautiful girls. The characters who are active there have changed into black market nouveau riche who made war fortunes.</p>
<p>But it would be an exaggeration to say that the war had no impact on Monaco. For example, once a group of warships came to visit the country, and unfortunately, all the cash on the ship disappeared. This incident made the officers on the ship furious, and they declared that if the lost money was not found, they would bombard the copper roof of the Monte Carlo Casino. Later, this matter was finally concluded in a "happy ending," and the lost money was "returned to the original owner."</p>
<p>On another occasion, in the final stages of the war, Germans felt a great lack of yellow steel, so they turned their attention to the steel roof of Monte Carlo. Fortunately, the German commander who occupied Monaco had read many novels about Monte Carlo and was unwilling to excessively ruin this art treasure, so they survived another crisis!</p>
<p>Monte Carlo has been profitable for 80 years, with the exception of 1939-1940, when it lost 5.8 million francs. Afterwards, it resumed profitability. After the end of the war, business declined again due to the difficulties of life in various places.</p>
<p>Although there are many difficulties at present, Monte Carlo is still quite confident that the golden age of the past will eventually return. The casino management is already preparing to build a radio station, preparing to broadcast sensational "gambling scriptures" to the world in order to attract tourists to this small country with beautiful mountains and clear waters to spend some time, then the money spent in hotels, restaurants, casinos, and scenic spots can maintain the country's expenses. In addition, the casino is also greatly expanding, and it must be made all-encompassing, with everything that should be available, so that tourists can broaden their horizons. In addition, the pawnshop has resumed overnight business, and a police bell, similar to the entrance of a pharmacy, has been installed on the door to meet the urgent needs of customers.</p>
<p>Indeed, for those who are interested in world travel, it seems necessary to take a trip to Monte Carlo. One thing that is certain is that the local hosts will definitely treat you with sincerity.</p>

<h3>After Chen's Execution</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Before Chen Gongbo was executed by shooting, he repeatedly requested to "look good."</p>
<p>Once, during the final trial in court, he requested to wear a long gown; once, before going to the execution ground, he requested to be exempt from being bound; once, during the execution, he requested that the police officers be quick. The conclusion was all for the sake of "looking good."</p>
<p>In fact, a bullet entering from the back of the head and exiting from the right cheek cannot look good no matter how hard you try. Chen Gongbo, as clever as he was, probably still didn't want to think about this. Alas, how extreme is the desire to "die with dignity"!</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo has now been executed according to the law. The traditional Chinese moral view is that once a person dies, everything is written off; this is because emotion outweighs reason and law. However, there is a historical exception, which is the story of Wu Zixu flogging the corpse.</p>
<p>Following this tradition, there is naturally a thought of pitying talent and a fondness for the defeated. It is said that when Chen was first tried, someone in the audience applauded greatly; and after the verdict, two gentlemen in Shanghai applied for a retrial for him. Yesterday, this page published "How Zhou Zuoren Should Be Sentenced," which is also an example.</p>
<p>There are too many examples. In the past, if Wang Jingwei had not died, now if Hitler was still alive, even foreign friends would inevitably have this mentality.</p>
<p>This is a danger, which can evolve into destroying the law and disrupting discipline, with no true right or wrong.</p>
<h3>Strolling in the Park in Summer</h3>
<p>— Ping Qi</p>
<p>There are thirteen parks in Shanghai</p>
<p>"Sir, what would you like to eat?"</p>
<p>"DDT!"</p>
<p>In a corner of Zhongshan Park, I heard a young tourist tell the waiter in the park tea room. The companions all laughed at this novel answer, and then asked him to bring a few bottles of soda.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>weather is gradually getting hotter, and the number of tourists in the park has suddenly increased. This is the cheapest place for recreation in Shanghai. You can get a small booklet of tickets for one hundred yuan, with a total of five tickets, which can be used in any of the thirteen parks in Shanghai. From June 1st, the closing time of the park has been extended to 10:00 pm, so after spending twenty yuan, as long as you are interested, you can stroll from early in the morning until late at night. There are tea rooms in the park, Western food and egg fried rice to eat in the Bund Park, and Cantonese dim sum in Fuxing Park in Gujiazhai. Sitting in front of the flowers and eating heartily is not a joy in life.</p>
<p>But—have you had a vaccination?</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>don't know why, but Shanghai people especially like to eat shaved ice, so the tea rooms in various parks often supply a large amount of it. Is it clean and hygienic? I haven't heard of anyone testing it. The soda that the tourist who wanted to eat DDT drank was the "××" brand, and others should test the "××" brand of beverage for our health bureau—the person who tested it was found by the American MP, and they found twenty-two kinds of beverages that "contain unclean and harmful ingredients and are not suitable for human beverages."</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has indeed made achievements in repairing these thirteen parks. When we just won, the benches in Fuxing Park were torn down and used as firewood, but now they have been repaired and painted with a layer of green paint, which is quite harmonious with the surrounding lush shade.</p>
<p>But, if you are a female tourist, I will ask again—are you wearing high heels?</p>
<p>Because, the asphalt roads in any park are sparsely covered with small sunken pits, some deep and some shallow, some large and some small. In case you think the scenery on all sides is really too beautiful, or you are not careful, your heel will be embedded in these scattered small trap pits, and there will be a risk of tragedy.</p>
<p>The park, of course, is a paradise for children. A happy mother pushing a delicate and beautiful stroller slowly walking in the park is such a beautiful picture!</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>, if your child is already five or six years old, likes to ask questions and get to the bottom of things, then you should think more about taking him to the park.</p>
<p>Because, inside the park, some things cannot stand your child getting to the bottom of them. For example, in Zhongzheng Park in Hongkou, people often squat on the ground playing Pai Gow, and some gamblers are just big kids in their teens. They gamble and shout, and I have even seen them fight. There are many strange women in the Bund Park. They dress strangely, and the way they walk and look at people is also very strange. At night, they sometimes pull and pull other tourists—if your child asks you, how will you answer him?</p>
<p>However, the sports park in Zhongshan Park (formerly Zhaofeng Park) is worth a visit. Those animals are happy. The zoo is not very large, but these rabbits, monkeys, geese, three bears, and one deer—are all more fortunate than ordinary Shanghai people. There are too few of them, so although they may be a little lonely, they never suffer from housing shortages. Someone may feel dizzy and even nauseous from the smell of the road and the park's pool when walking to the zoo, but this is actually giving us all the best opportunity to use waste. You think, how many gas masks that are completely useless have been left after the war? Everyone wearing gas masks to stroll in the park, isn't that great!</p>
<h3>See You Poor</h3>
<p>— Di Ping</p>
<p>The English name of Yiyuan is Canicrome, which means "dog ring", and the pronunciation is equal to "see you poor". In the past, when there were dog races, I don't know how many people could not escape this ring, becoming very poor; now the dance hall and restaurant are expensive, and still maintain the atmosphere of "see you poor".</p>

<h3>The Mermaid Prefers Quiet to Activity</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>Mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, since becoming disillusioned in the realm of love, had once disappeared from public view. A month ago, the Overseas Chinese News was launched, and Yang, due to her connection with the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, was invited to join the newspaper as a reporter. When Mayor Wu's wife came to Shanghai, Yang wrote an "Interview Record," which was published in the newspaper. Her writing was clear and elegant, and praised by her colleagues. However, the only condition for a reporter's life is to have a thick skin and diligent legs, to "show one's face" everywhere, but the Mermaid was not accustomed to this, preferring quiet to activity, which affected her work mood and gradually lost interest. Recently, Yang finally resigned. She was then hired by the Finance Department of the Executive Yuan to serve as a "typist." Thus, the Mermaid's life has taken another turn. Some say that Yang's situation is similar to that of Wang Renmei, a colleague in the Executive Yuan, and they can be said to be in the same boat. Now that they meet in the same room, they must feel "Why did we need to have known each other before?"</p>
<p>After the former president of the Heping Daily, Wan Meizi, resigned, he is now preparing to establish a publishing company, named "Ren Cong Zhong" (meaning "crowd"). I remember that there is a snack bar in Chengdu called "Kou Pin" (meaning "taste"), which would make a wonderfully matched couplet. In addition, I still remember that more than ten years ago, there was a student at the Beiping Women's Normal University named "Shi Lei" (who was involved in a property dispute and had a lawsuit with a monk, which once caused a sensation in the old capital). Compared with the above two names, it is also a rare and excellent couplet.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the American army in Shanghai, bars and brothels have all been doing good business. Because American soldiers have been on the battlefield for a long time, their lives are dull and monotonous. Once they arrive in the world of pleasure, their revelry is only human nature. However, many reckless ghosts, relying on their complete "equipment," believe that there is no danger. Unexpectedly, indulging excessively has led to many carelessly contracting diseases. When they triumphantly return home and stagger ashore, their families are unaware and believe that a "decorated soldier" has returned, giving them extra comfort. Later, the American military headquarters learned about this and implemented collective treatment and conducted a detailed investigation of the source. According to the reporter's report, among the Shanghai part, a total of 69 people were infected by prostitutes, 111 by bar girls, 310 by dancers (referring to sailor dance halls), and two by girlfriends (?). However, the above figures also include foreign prostitutes, dancers, bar girls, and girlfriends. Afterwards, the American military also sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau, expressing "concern" about this and willing to assist the police bureau in "disinfection," which is another cooperation outside of Sino-American cooperation.</p>
<h3>A Descendant of Qu Yuan</h3>
<p>— Sima Huan</p>
<p>Yesterday, while eating zongzi, I wonder if everyone still thought of that great national poet who walked along the riverbank, was upright and talented, and had a backbone and blood?</p>
<p>King Huai of Chu alienated him, and King Qingxiang was even more impolite, relocating him to the riverbank. This scholar, who was knowledgeable, strong-willed, and clear about governance and chaos, and skilled in rhetoric, encountered two periods of repression from father and son. How could he not be worried and thoughtful, throwing himself into the Miluo River with a stone in his arms, and indignantly seeking to remain pure?</p>
<p>If Qu Yuan were to be reborn more than two thousand years later and encounter that Shangguan Dafu who slandered him again and again, he might put on a smiling face, run to the public mansion, make arrangements, be willing to be included in the cadre, get promoted and make a fortune, be successful in all directions, and have nothing to say.</p>
<p>However, every year at the Dragon Boat Festival, how can we eat zongzi and how can we perform the Dragon Boat Race?</p>
<h3>Brief Introduction to Songs and Composers in Lang Yuxiu's Solo Concert</h3>
<p>— Cao</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>"Messiah" is a world-renowned work by the famous oratorio composer Handel. The structure of recitation, solo, and chorus is very symmetrical. The above two pieces are selected from the drama. The first song is a very beautiful soprano piece. The words have been selected as Handel's gazette in the Holy West Temple in England to commemorate this generation of music sage.</p>
<p>2A</p>
<p>"The Maid of Cadiz" was published in 1872, with a Spanish dance flavor. The author, Delibes, focused on operas, comedies, and operettas in his early years. His later works began to focus on ballet.</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>The Italian pianist and composer Arditi (1892-1903) composed many coloratura soprano songs, "Il Bacio" being one of them. This is a waltz that depicts the sweetness of a kiss. It is very humorous and popular. Arditi spent most of his life abroad, traveling to Germany, Austria, Russia, and other countries to perform, and was known as an opera conductor.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The author Wekerlin was musically gifted as a child. His father was a manufacturer. Because he was unwilling to study business, he fled to Paris and entered the Conservatory of Music to specialize in music. He then succeeded as a famous composer. The tunes he composed were all light and exquisite.</p>
<p>4 Homecoming Song</p>
<p>This song depicts the emotions of people returning home after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. It was recently created by the young Chinese writer Zhang Dinghe. Zhang has created many works during the Anti-Japanese War, which have been well received everywhere. It was performed in Chongqing and appreciated by General Marshall.</p>
<p>5 A How Can I Not Think of Her</p>
<p>B Drinking Song from La Traviata</p>
<p>Among modern Chinese songs rich in poetry, Mr. Zhao Yuanren's works are the most popular. These two are the most loved by the general public. Zhao is currently teaching at an American university.</p>
<p>C I Nong Ci</p>
<p>Madam Guan of Zhao Mengfu was good at writing poems and painting. Zhao wanted to take a concubine and first used a short poem to observe Guan's intention. Guan answered with this poem. Songxue laughed loudly after getting the poem, and the intention to take a concubine stopped. This tune was composed by Professor Ying Shangneng for the bass.</p>
<p>6 A</p>
<p>Hahn Qingnian loved composing music since he was young. From his songs, ballets, and operas, we can understand the essence of his art. This song means that if my poems have wings, they will fly straight to the beautiful garden, and like little birds, I will lovingly surround you all day long.</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>This nocturnal feast song was composed by Gounod. The mood is very beautiful. Gounod is a French composer. His masterpiece can be said to be unprecedented. He became famous before his famous opera "Faust" was completed.</p>
<p>6 A</p>
<p>Cavatine is selected from the opera Semiramide. This two-act song with oriental colors was completed by the author Rossini in just one month. The lyrics were written by the French writer Voltaire. The plot tells a story of a love triangle in ancient times. This song is sung by the heroine of the drama.</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>The author Verdi is from Northern Italy and is from the same era as Wagner. In "La Traviata," he once again showed his outstanding talent in his later years. This song is one of them. His music in this play is suitable for performers to match, but it is extraordinarily exquisite. He does not need to spend a lot of energy, creating nature ingeniously.</p>

<h3>Breaking Glass Solves Food and Lodging</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>It is said that there was a monk who ate meat all year round. When a pilgrim asked if he was not afraid of sin, the monk said well, "If I don't go to hell, who will?" The abbot of the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road has recently had the temple premises occupied by the district government as an office. Killing chickens and cooking meat in the temple kitchen is suspected of insulting the Buddhist temple. He has submitted a request to the authorities to order them to move. In the eyes of the monk who eats meat all year round, he must think that the problem is not just killing chickens and cooking meat.</p>
<p>The movie theaters in Chongqing, although the buildings and facilities are far inferior to the small movie theaters in Shanghai, have long implemented assigned seating. Shanghai, which is known for taking the lead in everything, has caused a storm over the issue of assigned seating in major movie theaters, causing a mess. People in Sichuan were very surprised to hear this.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai had regulations that poor people deliberately broke store windows in the downtown area, waiting to be caught and taken to the government office, but were therefore able to solve three meals in the Western prison. In the future, if the same incident is discovered, I believe that there will be at least two factors. In addition to the bread problem, it should be the housing problem.</p>
<p>According to reports, Lang Yuxiu is scheduled to hold solo concerts at the Lyceum Theater every night on the 5th, 6th, and 7th. The program includes Western famous songs such as Messiah and Flowers of the Alps. Another news item said, "A gathering will be held at a hotel in Paris on June 4, where French film and drama actresses will recite ancient Chinese poems, mostly Li Bai's poems." This is certainly a good example of Sino-Western cultural exchange. What is suspected is that many ancient Chinese poems are so profound that even the Chinese cannot understand them, but foreigners can recite them fluently from the mouths of actresses. Who knows.</p>
<p>According to estimates by the Hong Kong health authorities, there are currently one million rats in Hong Kong, equal to the population. This estimate is not to be believed unless rats also have household registration to check.</p>

<h3>The Shiwan Mountains in Guangdong and Guangxi Have Very Rich Reserves</h3>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>The Shiwan Mountain Survey Team, jointly organized by Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, entered the mountains before the victory and worked for more than seven months, traveling nearly ten thousand miles. Starting from Maju Mountain in the Qin and Fang counties of Guangdong Province in the east and ending at Paiai in the Sile County of Guangxi Province in the west, the survey has been completed. The team's measurement results revealed that the entire area of ​​the Shiwan Mountains reaches more than 2,000 square kilometers. In terms of plants, forty to fifty species of rubber vines have been discovered, including six of the best. There are many medicinal plants, including a species of bitter cassia, which can be an effective drug for dysentery. A considerable number of wood that can be used for aviation manufacturing has also been discovered. In terms of minerals, the most abundant reserves are antimony, silver, and coal. Deposits have also been found, but the mineral age is young and the value is low. All plants, minerals, and other items have been sampled by the team.</p>

<p>Business Notice</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax Application Method</h3>
<p>Interpretation from the Direct Taxation Bureau</p>
<p>Qi Zhaogang asked: I read the notice from the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance: All commercial account books or capital books, except for joint-stock companies that have already affixed stamp tax on stocks, must be affixed with a stamp tax of 40 cents per hundred yuan of amount. The reader deeply believes that the general merchants in Shanghai feel troublesome, for two reasons: (1) It is said that the largest face value of the newly issued stamp is four yuan. (2) It is not easy to buy large denominations from banks and post offices that sell them on behalf. Currently, the capital of general merchants in Shanghai is around tens of millions of yuan. Even if the stamp tax is 40 cents per hundred yuan, a large stamp with a face value of 400 yuan, for example, a capital of 10 million yuan, would require purchasing 40,000 yuan worth of stamps, which is as many as 100 sheets. How can it be affixed to the account book? Can the Direct Taxation Bureau issue a tax payment receipt and affix it to the account book for convenience, whether it is legal or not? Please ask your column to answer on behalf of the public. (Reply from the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance)</p>
<p>I have received a letter from your reader, who has questions about the stamp tax application method. The following is an explanation: (1) Stamps with a face value of 1,000 yuan are now available on the market and can be purchased from banks and post offices that sell stamps on behalf. (2) If the amount of each application is more than 10,000 yuan, you can come to the fourth section of this bureau or the offices in each district to apply for a triplicate payment form. After paying to the national treasury, affix the receipt to the account book. I hope you will check and forward the above two points, and publish them in your newspaper for public viewing. Sincerely yours, Social Service Department of Shen Bao.</p>

He left behind his sister-in-law, Xiuzhen, who lives in your family's residence. I cannot go there due to military affairs. Later, I was ordered to accept the surrender and suppress bandits, and stationed in Xuzhou. There is no communication with each other. Please let us know in the newspaper. Wang Shipei of the 132nd Division of Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Seeking My Son Sheng Kao: You left home after the Anti-Japanese War and worked in rear hospitals in Shaobo and Gaoyou, etc. There has been no news of you so far. My elderly parents are looking forward to you. I hope you will see this notice, pack your bags and go home to comfort your parents. We are looking forward to you. Your father, Chen, at 63 Nantang, Chenxian Bridge, Wuxi.</p>
<p>Seeking Cao Luguiying: After twelve years of separation, I came to Shanghai from Tongxiang to visit the old address on Xipushi Road, only to find out that you have moved elsewhere. I hope you will see this newspaper and send a letter to Lu Bohong (Qi Na) c/o Mao's residence, 13 Lane 461, Zhongzheng Middle Road.</p>
<p>Seeking Father Yan Lin: My father is from Beiping. He came to Shanghai in the 28th year of the Republic (1939) and invested in and operated the Dongyide Grocery Store at 680 North Sichuan Road. He has not returned home for several years. I have come to Shanghai to visit him, but the original store has closed down. I don't know where my father is? I am very anxious. If any fellow villagers or friends know my father's whereabouts, please notify the South Hebei Fellow Villagers Association at the New City God Temple. I will be very grateful. (Yan Zijun)</p>
